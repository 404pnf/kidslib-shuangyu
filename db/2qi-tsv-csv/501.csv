"The Red Etin","红色的埃廷"
"by Andrew Lang","作者：安德鲁·朗格"
"There were ance twa widows that lived on a small bit o’ ground, which they rented from a farmer.","从前，有两个寡妇，她们住在一小块从某个农场主那里租来的田地里。"
"Ane of them had twa sons, and the other had ane; and by-and-by it was time for the wife that had twa sons to send them away to seeke their fortune.","一个寡妇有两个儿子，而另一个寡妇只有一个；过了不久，到那位有两个儿子的寡妇送他们出门去寻找自己财富的时候了。"
"So she told her eldest son ae day to take a can and bring her water from the well, that she might bake a cake for him; and however much or however little water he might bring, the cake would be great or sma’ accordingly; and that cake was to be a’ that she could gie him when he went on his travels.","于是这天，她让大儿子拿一个罐子去井边打水，好让她为他做一块蛋糕；他打来水的多少，将相应地决定蛋糕的大小；而这个蛋糕是她在他上路时能够给他的全部东西。"
"The lad gaed away wi’ the can to the well, and filled it wi’ water, and then came away hame again; but the can being broken the maist part of the water had run out before he got back.","这位小伙子拿着罐子来到井边，把它灌满后带回了家；但罐子是漏的，在他到家之前水已经流走了一大半。"
"So his cake was very sma’; yet sma’ as it was, his mother asked if he was willing to take the half of it with her blessing, telling him that, if he chose rather to have the hale, he would only get it wi’ her curse.","因此他的蛋糕很小；尽管这块蛋糕小得可怜，他的母亲却问他愿不愿意只带走一半，并加上她的祝福，如果他执意要拿走整个蛋糕，将只能得到她的诅咒。"
"The young man, thinking he might hae to travel a far way, and not knowing when or how he might get other provisions, said he would like to hae the hale cake, com of his mother’s malison what like; so she gave him the hale cake, and her malison alang wi’t.","这位年轻人想到自己可能要走很长的路，不知何时以及怎样才能得到其他食物，于是他选择拿走整块带有他母亲诅咒的蛋糕；于是她就将带着自己诅咒的蛋糕给了他。"
"Then he took his brither aside, and gave him a knife to keep till he should come back, desiring him to look at it every morning, and as lang as it continued to be clear, then he might be sure that the owner of it was well; but if it grew dim and rusty, then for certain some ill had befallen him.","接着这位年轻人把他的弟弟叫到一边，给了他一把刀子，让他好好保存直到自己回来，并嘱咐他要每天早晨观察一下，只要刀子是干净明亮的，就说明自己是健康的；但是如果它变得生锈而暗淡了，那么他肯定就是出事了。"
"So the young man set out to seek his fortune.","于是这位年轻人就出发寻找自己的财富去了。"
"And he gaed a’ that day, and a’ the next day; and on the third day, in the afternoon, he came up to where a shepherd was sitting with a flock o’ sheep.","他走了一整天，又走了一整天。第三天下午，他遇到一个牧羊人正赶着一群绵羊。"
"And he gaed up to the shepherd and asked him wha the sheep belanged to; and the man answered:","他走上前去问这位牧羊人，这些绵羊属于谁，这个牧羊人答道："
"“The Red Etin of Ireland","“爱尔兰的红色埃廷，"
"Ance lived in Bellygan,","曾经住在贝利干，"
"And stole King Malcolm’s daughter,","他偷了麦尔肯国王的女儿，"
"The King of fair Scotland.","那可是美丽的苏格兰的国王。"
"He beats her, he binds her,","他将公主毒打，他将公主囚禁，"
"He lays her on a band;","他用绳子将公主捆绑；"
"And every day he dings her","他日日夜夜对着公主念咒，"
"With a bright silver wand","用的是一根闪闪发光的银质魔杖，"
"Like Julian the Roman","就像罗马人朱利安那样，"
"He’s one that fears no man.","他谁也不怕。"
"It’s said there’s ane predestinate","据说他命中注定，"
"To be his mortal foe;","有一个不共戴天的敌人；"
"But that man is yet unborn","但那个人还没出生呢，"
"And lang may it be so.”","这要等到很久以后了。”"
"The young man then went on his journey; and he had not gone far when he espied an old man with white locks herding a flock of swine; and he gaed up to him and asked whose swine these were, when the man answered:","于是这位年轻人继续踏上旅程；他走了没多远，便遇上一个满头白发的老头在放牧一群猪；他走上前去，问那个老头这群猪是谁的，老头答道："
"“The Red Etin of Ireland”—","“爱尔兰的红色埃廷”——"
"(Repeat the verses above.)","（重复上面的诗句。）"
"Then the young man gaed on a bit farther, and came to another very old man herding goats; and when he asked whose goats they were, the answer was:","接着这位年轻人又向前走了一段，他又碰到一个年纪很大的老人在放牧山羊；当他问到它们是谁的山羊时，老人答道："
"“The Red Etin of Ireland”—","“爱尔兰的红色埃廷”——"
"(Repeat the verses again.)","（再次重复上面的诗句。）"
"This old man also told him to beware of the next beasts that he should meet, for they were of a very different kind from any he had yet seen.","老人还提醒他要留心接下来可能遇到的野兽，因为它们与他曾经见过的任何其他野兽都不同。"
"So the young man went on, and by-and-by he saw a multitude of very dreadfu’ beasts, ilk ane o’ them wi’ twa heads, and on every head four horns.","于是这位年轻人继续向前走，不久他便看到了一群非常可怕的野兽，它们每一只都有两个脑袋，每个脑袋上长了四只角。"
"And he was sore frightened, and ran away from them as fast as he could; and glad was he when he came to a castle that stood on a hillock, wi’ the door standing wide to the wa’.","他害怕极了，拼命地跑开；值得高兴的是，他跑到了一座小山上的城堡前，城堡的大门敞开着。"
"And he gaed into the castle for shelter, and there he saw an auld wife sitting beside the kitchen fire.","他躲进了城堡，在城堡里面，他看到了一个老妇坐在厨房的火炉边。"
"He asked the wife if he might stay there for the night, as he was tired wi’ a lang journey; and the wife said he might, but it was not a good place for him to be in, as it belanged to the Red Etin, who was a very terrible beast, wi’ three heads, that spared no living man he could get hold of.","他问那个老妇自己可不可以留下来过夜，因为他走了太远的路，实在是累坏了；老妇说他可以留下来，但这里并不安全，因为这儿是红色埃廷的地盘，他是个非常恐怖的怪兽，长着三个脑袋，落到他手上的人都要丧命。"
"The young man would have gone away, but he was afraid of the beasts on the outside of the castle; so he beseeched the old woman to conceal him as well as she could, and not to tell the Etin that he was there.","年轻人本来想要离开，但他又惧怕城堡外面的那些野兽。于是他求老妇将他藏起来，藏得尽量隐蔽，并且不要告诉埃廷他在城堡里。"
"He thought, if he could put over the night, he might get away in the morning without meeting wi’ the beasts, and so escape.","他觉得如果自己可以熬过这一晚，那么第二天一早就可以躲过那些怪兽逃走了。"
"But he had not been long in his hidy-hole before the awful Etin came in; and nae sooner was he in than he was heard crying:","但是他藏了没多久，可怕的埃廷就进来了；一进门，他就吼了起来："
"“Snouk but and snouk ben,","“闻闻外屋，闻闻里屋，"
"I find the smell of an earthly man;","我闻到了人类的味道；"
"Be he living, or be he dead,","不管他是活还是死，"
"His heart shall be kitchen to my bread.”","今晚我都要拿他的心脏给我的面包调调味儿。”"
"The monster soon found the poor young man, and pulled him from his hole.","怪兽很快就发现了这位可怜的年轻人，并把他从藏身洞里拖了出来。"
"And when he had got him out he told him that if he could answer him three questions his life should be spared.","他把年轻人拽出来以后对他说，如果能够回答三个问题，就饶他一命。"
"The first was: Whether Ireland or Scotland was first inhabited?","第一个问题是：爱尔兰和苏格兰哪里先有人居住？"
"The second was: Whether man was made for woman, or woman for man?","第二个问题是：是男人为女人而生，还是女人为男人而生？"
"The third was: Whether men or brutes were made first?","第三个问题是：先有人，还是先有野兽？"
"The lad not being able to answer one of these questions, the Red Etin took a mace and knocked him on the head, and turned him into a pillar of stone.","小伙子一个问题都没能回答上来，红色埃廷就用一个狼牙棒敲了他的脑袋一下，把他变成了一个石柱。"
"On the morning after this happened the younger brither took out the knife to look at it, and he was grieved to find it a’ brown wi’ rust.","第二天早晨，弟弟拿出刀子来看，伤心地发现它已经布满灰尘，变成了黑褐色。"
"He told his mother that the time was now come for him to go away upon his travels also; so she requested him to take the can to the well for water, that she might bake a cake for him.","他对母亲说，现在到他自己上路的时候了；于是她就让儿子拿着罐子去井边打水，好让自己做一个蛋糕给他。"
"The can being broken, he brought hame as little water as the other had done, and the cake was as little.","罐子是漏的，他打回家的水和哥哥打回来的一样少，于是蛋糕同样也很小。"
"She asked whether he would have the hale cake wi’ her malison, or the half wi’ her blessing; and, like his brither, he thought it best to have the hale cake, come o’ the malison what might.","寡妇问他是要拿走带有她诅咒的整块蛋糕，还是拿走带有她祝福的半块；然而，他和哥哥一样，觉得尽管也许会有诅咒，但最好是带上整块蛋糕。"
"So he gaed away; and everything happened to him that had happened to his brother!","于是他便上路了，一路上的遭遇和哥哥完全相同！"
"The other widow and her son heard of a’ that had happened frae a fairy, and the young man determined that he would also go upon his travels, and see if he could do anything to relieve his twa friends.","另一家的寡妇和她的儿子从一位小精灵那里听说了这件事，于是这位年轻人决定要踏上自己的旅途，并试试看能否将他的两个朋友救出来。"
"So his mother gave him a can to go to the well and bring home water, that she might bake him a cake for his journey.","于是他的母亲给了他一个罐子，让他去井边打些水回来，好让她做个蛋糕给他带在路上吃。"
"And he gaed, and as he was bringing hame the water, a raven owre abune his head cried to him to look, and he would see that the water was running out.","他便去了，在他回家的路上，一只乌鸦在他的头上叫起来，让他看看罐子，他就发现了水正从罐子里流出来。"
"And he was a young man of sense, and seeing the water running out, he took some clay and patched up the holes, so that he brought home enough water to bake a large cake.","他是一个很理智的年轻人，看到水正在流出来，就拿了些泥将那些洞补好，于是他带回家的水足够做一个大蛋糕。"
"When his mother put it to him to take the half-cake wi’ her blessing, he took it in preference to having the hale wi’ her malison; and yet the half was bigger than what the other lads had got a’thegither.","当他的母亲要他带着半块蛋糕和自己的祝福上路时，年轻人选择了这半块蛋糕而不是带有诅咒的一整块。而即使是半块，也比之前的两兄弟带走的要大。"
"So he gaed away on his journey; and after he had traveled a far way he met wi’ an auld woman, that asked him if he would give her a bit of his bannock.","于是他便开始了自己的旅程；他走了很远的路，碰到了一个老妇人，这位老妇人问他可不可以分给自己一点儿蛋糕。"
"And he said he would gladly do that, and so he gave her a piece of the bannock; and for that she gied him a magical wand, that she said might yet be of service to him if he took care to use it rightly.","他表示自己很乐意这么做，于是就分了一块蛋糕给她；作为回报，老妇人给了他一只魔杖，并告诉他只要小心用对地方，会对他有帮助的。"
"Then the auld woman, who was a fairy, told him a great deal that whould happen to him, and what he ought to do in a’ circumstances; and after that she vanished in an instant out o’ his sight.","这位老妇是一个仙女，她告诉了年轻人将要发生在他身上的一切和相应的处理方法；之后，她便突然在他眼前消失了。"
"He gaed on a great way farther, and then he came up to the old man herding the sheep; and when he asked whose sheep these were, the answer was:","小伙子又向前走了很远，这时他遇到一个放牧绵羊的老人；他问老人这些绵羊是谁的，老人回答说："
"“The Red Etin of Ireland","“爱尔兰的红色埃廷，"
"Ance lived in Bellygan,","他曾经住在贝利干，"
"And stole King Malcolm’s daughter,","他偷走了麦尔肯国王的女儿，"
"The King of fair Scotland.","那可是美丽的苏格兰的国王。"
"He beats her, he binds her,","他将公主毒打，他将公主关押，"
"He lays her on a band;","他用绳子将公主捆绑；"
"And every day he dings her","他日日夜夜对着公主念咒，"
"With a bright silver wand.","用的是一根闪闪发光的银质魔杖。"
"Like Julian the Roman,","就像罗马人朱利安那样，"
"He’s one that fears no man,","他谁也不怕，"
"But now I fear his end is near,","但是现在他的末日恐怕要到了，"
"And destiny at hand;","命运即将展开；"
"And you’re to be, I plainly see,","我清楚地看到，你将是，"
"The heir of all his land.”","他所有土地的继承者。”"
"(Repeat the same inquiries to the man attending the swine and the man attending the goats, with the same answer in each case.)","（他又问了放猪和放山羊的人同样的问题，每次得到的都是一样的回答。）"
"When he came to the place where the monstrous beasts were standing, he did not stop nor run away, but went boldly through among them.","当他来到那些巨大怪兽站立的地方时，他并没有停下或者逃走，而是勇敢地向它们之间走去。"
"One came up roaring with open mouth to devour him, when he struck it with his wand, and laid it in an instant dead at his feet.","其中一只冲了上来，咆哮着张开大口想要吞掉他，就在那时，他用魔杖敲了那只怪兽一下，它立马就倒在他的脚边死掉了。"
"He soon came to the Etin’s castle, where he knocked, and was admitted.","他很快来到了埃廷的城堡前，他敲了敲门，被允许进入城堡。"
"The auld woman that sat by the fire warned him of the terrible Etin, and what had been the fate of the twa brithers; but he was not to be daunted.","坐在火炉边的老妇人提醒他埃廷的可怕，并告诉他发生在之前两兄弟身上的事情；但是他并不畏惧。"
"The monster soon came in, saying:","很快那只怪兽就进来了，说道："
"“Snouk but and snouk ben,","“闻闻外屋，闻闻里屋，"
"I find the smell of an earthly man;","我闻到了人类的味道；"
"Be he living, or be he dead,","不管他是活还是死，"
"His heart shall be kitchen to my bread.”","今晚我都要用他的心脏给我的面包调调味儿。”"
"He quickly espied the young man, and bade him come forth on the floor.","他很快发现了那个年轻人，命令他走向前站到地板上来。"
"And then he put the three questions to him, but the young man had been told everything by the good fairy, so he was able to answer all the questions.","接着他问了年轻人那三个问题，但是仙女已经告诉年轻人将要发生的一切，所以他回答出了所有的问题。"
"When the Etin found this he knew that his power was gone.","当埃廷发现这一切的时候，他知道自己的魔力全部消失了。"
"The young man then took up the axe and hewed off the monster’s three heads.","年轻人拿起斧头砍下了怪兽的三个脑袋。"
"He next asked the old woman to show him where the King’s daughters lay; and the old woman took him upstairs and opened a great many doors, and out of every door came a beautiful lady who had been imprisoned there by the Etin; and ane o’ the ladies was the King’s daughter.","接着他又让那个老妇领着他去国王的女儿被关押的地方；老妇人带着他来到楼上，打开了一扇扇屋门，每间屋子里都走出一个被埃廷关押着的漂亮姑娘；其中一位就是国王的女儿。"
"She also took him down into a low room, and there stood two stone pillars that he had only to touch wi’ his wand, when his two friends and neighbors started into life.","老妇人又带他来到一间地下室，那儿立着两尊石柱，他只用魔杖碰了碰石柱，这两位朋友就渐渐恢复了生命。"
"And the hale o’ the prisoners were overjoyed at their deliverance, which they all acknowledged to be owing to the prudent young man.","这些人被解救出来以后高兴万分，都表示自己欠了这位聪明的年轻人一份人情。"
"Next day they a’ set out for the King’s Court, and a gallant company they made.","第二天，他们一起出发去觐见国王，场面相当壮观。"
"And the King married his daughter to the young man that had delivered her, and gave a noble’s daughter to ilk ane o’ the other young men; and so they a’ lived happily a’ the rest o’ their days.","国王将女儿嫁给了救出她的这位年轻小伙子。又将两位贵族的女儿嫁给了另外两个年轻人；他们幸福地渡过了余生。"
