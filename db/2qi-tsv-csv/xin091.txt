"Little Red Riding Hood","小红帽"
"by Andrew Lang","作者：安德鲁·朗格"
"Once upon a time there lived in a certain village a little country girl, the prettiest creature was ever seen.","从前，有个村子里住着一个可爱的乡村小姑娘，她是这个世界上最美丽的生灵。"
"Her mother was excessively fond of her; and her grandmother doted on her still more.","她的母亲对她极度宠爱，而她的外婆对她更是宠爱有加。"
"This good woman had made for her a little red riding-hood; which became the girl so extremely well that everybody called her Little Red Riding-Hood.","这位慈祥的老妇人为女孩亲手缝制了一顶可爱小巧的红色披风。这披风穿在她身上显得如此合适，以至于所有人都叫她“小红帽”。"
"One day her mother, having made some custards, said to her:","有一天，她的母亲做了一些奶油蛋羹，对她说："
"“Go, my dear, and see how thy grandmamma does, for I hear she has been very ill; carry her a custard, and this little pot of butter.”","“亲爱的，去看望一下你的外婆吧，因为我听说她最近身体很不好。给她带去一块奶油蛋羹，还有这一小罐黄油。”"
"Little Red Riding-Hood set out immediately to go to her grandmother, who lived in another village.","小红帽立刻出发去探望她那住在另一个村子里的外婆。"
"As she was going through the wood, she met with Gaffer Wolf, who had a very great mind to eat her up, but he dared not, because of some faggot-makers hard by in the forest.","她穿过一片森林时，遇见了一头大灰狼。大灰狼特别想把她吞进肚子里去，但它不敢轻举妄动，因为附近有很多劳作的伐木工人。"
"He asked her whither she was going.","它问小红帽要去往何处。"
"The poor child, who did not know that it was dangerous to stay and hear a wolf talk, said to him:","这可怜的孩子并不知道停下来和一头狼交谈是多么危险。她告诉狼说："
"“I am going to see my grandmamma and carry her a custard and a little pot of butter from my mamma.”","“我要去看望我的外婆，给她带一点儿妈妈做的奶油蛋羹，还有一小罐黄油。”"
"“Does she live far off?” said the Wolf.","狼问：“那她住得远吗？”"
"“Oh! ay,” answered Little Red Riding-Hood; “it is beyond that mill you see there, at the first house in the village.”","“哦！是的，”小红帽回答说，“你看那里有个磨坊，走过它，村子的第一间房子就是啦。”"
"“Well,” said the Wolf, “and I’ll go and see her too.","“哦，”狼说道，“那我也去看看她吧。"
"I’ll go this way and you go that, and we shall see who will be there soonest.”","我从这条路走，你从那条路走，我们看看谁先到吧。”"
"The Wolf began to run as fast as he could, taking the nearest way, and the little girl went by that farthest about, diverting herself in gathering nuts, running after butterflies, and making nosegays of such little flowers as she met with.","大灰狼奋力狂奔起来，它走了那条最近的小道。而小红帽走的则是条最远的路，一路上嬉戏玩耍，采摘坚果，追逐蝴蝶，将偶遇的那些路边小花编织成束。"
"The Wolf was not long before he got to the old woman’s house.","没过多久，大灰狼就赶到了老妇人的屋外。"
"He knocked at the door—tap, tap.","它嗒嗒地轻敲着屋门。"
"“Who’s there?”","“谁啊？”"
"“Your grandchild, Little Red Riding-Hood,” replied the Wolf, counterfeiting her voice; “who has brought you a custard and a little pot of butter sent you by mamma.”","“您的外孙女小红帽，”大灰狼伪装成小红帽的声音回答说，“妈妈让我给您带来了奶油蛋羹，还有一小罐黄油呢。”"
"The good grandmother, who was in bed, because she was somewhat ill, cried out:","善良的老妇人卧病在床，于是喊道："
"“Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.”","“拔下卷线轴，门闩就会自动打开啦。”"
"The Wolf pulled the bobbin, and the door opened, and then presently he fell upon the good woman and ate her up in a moment, for it was above three days that he had not touched a bit.","大灰狼拔下了卷线轴，门开了。它迫不及待地扑向那善良的外婆，一口吞了下去，因为它已经至少三天没沾一点儿荤腥了。"
"He then shut the door and went into the grandmother’s bed, expecting Little Red Riding-Hood, who came some time afterward and knocked at the door—tap, tap.","然后，它关上了门，钻进了外婆的床铺，等待小红帽的到来。过了一会儿，小红帽来了，嗒嗒地轻敲起门来。"
"“Who’s there?”","“谁啊？”"
"Little Red Riding-Hood, hearing the big voice of the Wolf, was at first afraid; but believing her grandmother had got a cold and was hoarse, answered:","听到大灰狼浑厚的嗓音，小红帽起初有点儿害怕；但是她以为外婆得了感冒，声音才如此嘶哑，于是答道："
"“’Tis your grandchild, Little Red Riding-Hood, who has brought you a custard and a little pot of butter mamma sends you.”","“是我，您的外孙女小红帽。妈妈让我给您带来了奶油蛋羹，还有一小罐黄油。”"
"The Wolf cried out to her, softening his voice as much as he could:","大灰狼尽力装出温柔的声音，向小红帽喊道："
"“Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.”","“拔下卷线轴，门闩就自动打开啦。”"
"Little Red Riding-Hood pulled the bobbin, and the door opened.","小红帽拔下了卷线轴，门开了。"
"The Wolf, seeing her come in, said to her, hiding himself under the bed-clothes:","大灰狼看到她走了进来，就将自己藏在被子里，对她说："
"“Put the custard and the little pot of butter upon the stool, and come and lie down with me.”","“把奶油蛋羹和黄油放在凳子上吧，来，陪外婆一起在床上躺着。”"
"Little Red Riding-Hood undressed herself and went into bed, where, being greatly amazed to see how her grandmother looked in her night-clothes, she said to her:","小红帽脱下了衣服，爬上床去，被外婆穿睡衣的样子给震惊了，于是对外婆说："
"“Grandmamma, what great arms you have got!”","“外婆，你的胳膊好粗！”"
"“That is the better to hug thee, my dear.”","“那样才能更好地拥抱你呀，我的宝贝。”"
"“Grandmamma, what great legs you have got!”","“外婆，你的腿也好粗！”"
"“That is to run the better, my child.”","“那样跑起来才更有力呀，我的孩子。”"
"“Grandmamma, what great ears you have got!”","“外婆，你的耳朵好大！”"
"“That is to hear the better, my child.”","“那样才听得更清楚，我的孩子。”"
"“Grandmamma, what great eyes you have got!”","“外婆，你的眼睛也这么大！”"
"“It is to see the better, my child.”","“这样才能看得更清晰，我的孩子。”"
"“Grandmamma, what great teeth you have got!”","“外婆，你的牙齿怎么也这么大！”"
"“That is to eat thee up.”","“那样才方便吃掉你！”"
"And, saying these words, this wicked wolf fell upon Little Red Riding-Hood, and ate her all up.","说完了这些话，这恶狼扑向了小红帽，一口把她吞了下去。"
