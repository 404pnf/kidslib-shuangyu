Asmund and Signy	阿斯木得和西格尼
by Andrew Lang	作者：安德鲁·朗格
Long, long ago, in the days when fairies, witches, giants and ogres still visited the earth, there lived a king who reigned over a great and beautiful country.	故事发生在很久很久以前，那时仙女们、女巫们、巨人们以及食人魔还在地球上。有一位国王，他统治着一个伟大而美丽的国家。
He was married to a wife whom he dearly loved, and had two most promising children—a son called Asmund, and a daughter who was named Signy.	他娶了一个妻子，并深深地爱着她，后来有了两个前途非常光明的孩子——男孩叫阿斯木得，女孩叫西格尼。
The king and queen were very anxious to bring their children up well, and the young prince and princess were taught everything likely to make them clever and accomplished.	国王与王后非常渴望培养好他们的孩子，因此，年轻的王子与公主被教授了一切可能使他们聪明而又多才多艺的课程。
They lived at home in their father’s palace, and he spared no pains to make their lives happy.	他们住在父亲的宫殿里，而他也不遗余力地让他们生活得幸福。
Prince Asmund dearly loved all outdoor sports and an open-air life, and from his earliest childhood he had longed to live entirely in the forest close by.	阿斯木得王子酷爱一切户外运动以及户外生活。从他还是个孩子的时候开始，他就渴望着能完完全全地生活在附近的森林里。
After many arguments and entreaties he succeeded in persuading the king to give him two great oak trees for his very own.	经过多次的争论和恳求，他终于成功说服国王把两棵大橡树给自己。
‘Now,’ said he to his sister, ‘I will have the trees hollowed out, and then I will make rooms in them and furnish them so that I shall be able to live out in the forest.’	“现在，”他对他的妹妹说，“我要把树挖空，然后在里面做几个房间，再布置好，这样我就可以住在树林里了。”
‘Oh, Asmund!’ exclaimed Signy, ‘what a delightful idea!	“哦，阿斯木得！”西格尼惊呼，“这是个多么棒的主意啊！
Do let me come too, and live in one of your trees.	让我也去吧，住在你的一棵树里。
I will bring all my pretty things and ornaments, and the trees are so near home we shall be quite safe in them.’	我会带上我所有的漂亮东西和装饰品，而且树离家这么近，我们在里面会很安全的。”
Asmund, who was extremely fond of his sister, readily consented, and they had a very happy time together, carrying over all their pet treasures, and Signy’s jewels and other ornaments, and arranging them in the pretty little rooms inside the trees.	阿斯木得欣然同意了，他非常疼爱他的妹妹，而且他们在一起的时候总是很快乐。于是，他们带上他们所有的小珍宝、西格尼的珠宝以及其他装饰品，把它们布置在了树里面那小小的、可爱的房间里。
Unfortunately sadder days were to come.	不幸的是，悲伤的日子即将来临。
A war with another country broke out, and the king had to lead his army against their enemy.	一场和另一个国家之间的战争爆发了，而国王不得不亲自带领他的军队去抵抗敌军。
During his absence the queen fell ill, and after lingering for some time she died, to the great grief of her children.	国王不在的时候，王后病倒了，弥留了一段时间后便去世了，这让她的孩子们伤心至极。
They made up their minds to live altogether for a time in their trees, and for this purpose they had provisions enough stored up inside to last them a year.	他们决定一同在树里生活一段时间，为此，他们储存了够在里面生活一年的粮食。
Now, I must tell you, in another country a long way off, there reigned a king who had an only son named Ring.	此刻，我得告诉你，在另一个遥远的国家里，有一个国王，他有一个独生子，叫做林。
Prince Ring had heard so much about the beauty and goodness of Princess Signy that he determined to marry her if possible.	林王子听说了很多关于西格尼公主的美丽与善良的传闻，因此他下定决心，如有可能，就要去娶她。
So he begged his father to let him have a ship for the voyage, set sail with a favourable wind, and after a time landed in the country where Signy lived.	于是他请求他的父亲给他一艘船出海，让他乘风出航。过了一段时间，他终于抵达西格尼所在的那个国家。
The prince lost no time in setting out for the royal palace, and on his way there he met such a wonderfully lovely woman that he felt he had never seen such beauty in all his life.	王子立刻向皇宫出发。在路上，他遇到了一个非常可爱的女人，他生平从未见过这样的美女。
He stopped her and at once asked who she was.	他拦下她，立刻问她是谁。
‘I am Signy, the king’s daughter,’ was the reply.	“我是西格尼，国王的女儿。”女子回答道。
Then the prince inquired why she was wandering about all by herself, and she told him that since her mother’s death she was so sad that whilst her father was away she preferred being alone.	接着王子问她为什么独自一人到处闲逛。她告诉他，自从她的母亲去世，她非常难过，同时她的父亲也不在身边，她宁愿独自一人。
Ring was quite deceived by her, and never guessed that she was not Princess Signy at all, but a strong, gigantic, wicked witch bent on deceiving him under a beautiful shape.	林完全被她欺骗了，压根猜不到她不是西格尼公主，而是一个强壮、庞大而邪恶的女巫，她故意用美丽的外表来蒙蔽他。
He confided to her that he had travelled all the way from his own country for her sake, having fallen in love with the accounts he had heard of her beauty, and he then and there asked her to be his wife.	他向她表白，说他是听说了她倾国倾城的美貌，心生爱慕，于是为了她，从自己的国家一路远行而来，接着，他当场就提出，想要她成为自己的妻子。
The witch listened to all he said and, much pleased, ended by accepting his offer; but she begged him to return to his ship for a little while as she wished to go some way further into the forest, promising to join him later on.	女巫听完了他的全部表白之后，非常高兴，便接受了他的求婚。但是她请求王子先回到他的船上等她一小会儿，而她要去森林更深处的一个地方，并保证之后会去找他。
Prince Ring did as she wished and went back to his ship to wait, whilst she walked on into the forest till she reached the two oak trees.	林王子按照她所希望的，回到他的船上等着，与此同时，她一直往森林里走，直到她到达了两棵橡树那里。
Here she resumed her own gigantic shape, tore up the trees by their roots, threw one of them over her back and clasped the other to her breast, carried them down to the shore and waded out with them to the ship.	在这里，她变回了原本的巨大外形，然后将树连根拔起，把其中一个搭在她的背后，另一个扣在她的胸前，把它们带到海边，又涉水来到船边。
She took care not to be noticed as she reached the ship, and directly she got on board she once more changed to her former lovely appearance and told the prince that her luggage was now all on board, and that they need wait for nothing more.	她小心翼翼地靠近船，没有被人察觉，然后她再一次变成之前可爱的模样，直接登上了船。她告诉王子，现在她所有的行李都在船上了，他们不用再等什么了。
The prince gave orders to set sail at once, and after a fine voyage landed in his own country, where his parents and his only sister received him with the greatest joy and affection.	王子下令立刻起航，在经过一段顺利的航行后，终于抵达了他自己的国家。在那里，他的父母和他唯一的妹妹正满心欢喜地来迎接他。
The false Signy was also very kindly welcomed.	假西格尼也同样受到热情款待。
A beautiful house was got ready for her, and Prince Ring had the two oaks planted in the garden just in front of her windows so that she might have the pleasure of seeing them constantly.	他们为她准备好了一座漂亮的房子，林王子把两棵橡树种在花园里，刚好就在她的窗户前，这样能时常看到它们，或许可以带给她一些欢乐。
He often went to visit the witch, whom he believed to be Princess Signy, and one day he asked: ‘Don’t you think we might be married before long?’	他常常去看望那个被他以为是西格尼公主的女巫。一天，他问道：“你难道不认为我们或许不久就会结婚吗？”
‘Yes,’ said she, quite pleased, ‘I am quite ready to marry you whenever you like.’	“是的，”她十分欣喜地说，“无论什么时候，只要你喜欢，我已经准备好嫁给你了。”
‘Then,’ replied Ring, ‘let us decide on this day fortnight.	“那么，”林回答，“我们就定在两周后的今天吧。
And see, I have brought you some stuff to make your wedding-dress of.’	看，我给你带来了一些做结婚礼服要用到的材料。”
 So saying he gave her a large piece of the most beautiful brocade, all woven over with gold threads, and embroidered with pearls and other jewels.	说着，他拿给她一大匹极其精美的锦缎，全部是用金线织成，还绣上了珍珠和其他宝石。
The prince had hardly left her before the witch resumed her proper shape and tore about the room, raging and storming and flinging the beautiful silk on the floor.	王子刚刚离开，女巫就变回了原形，在房间里到处乱窜，怒气冲冲地把华丽的丝绸扔到了地上。
‘What was SHE to do with such things?’ she roared.	“‘她’会拿这些东西干什么？”她咆哮着，
‘SHE did not know how to sew or make clothes, and she was sure to die of starvation into the bargain if her brother Ironhead did not come soon and bring her some raw meat and bones, for she really could eat nothing else.’	“‘她’不知道怎么缝制衣服，如果她的铁皮哥哥不赶快来给她带些生肉和骨头，她肯定会饿死的，因为她没什么别的可吃的。”
As she was raving and roaring in this frantic manner part of the floor suddenly opened and a huge giant rose up carrying a great chest in his arms.	她在那里疯狂地怒吼咆哮的时候，一块地板突然被打开了，一个高大的巨人手臂里夹着一个大箱子站了起来。
The witch was enchanted at this sight, and eagerly helped her brother to set down and open the chest, which was full of the ghastly food she had been longing for.	一看到这个，女巫高兴极了，急切地帮她的哥哥把箱子放下，赶忙打开箱子，里面装满了她期待已久的血腥恐怖的食物。
The horrid pair set to and greedily devoured it all, and when the chest was quite empty the giant put it on his shoulder and disappeared as he had come, without leaving any trace of his visit.	这对可怕的兄妹开始贪婪地吞噬着一切。当箱子里空无一物时，那个巨人便把它扛在肩上，就像他来的时候那样消失了，没有留下任何他来过的痕迹。
But his sister did not keep quiet for long, and tore and pulled at the rich brocade as if she wanted to destroy it, stamping about and shouting angrily.	但是他的妹妹久久不能平静，用力撕扯着精美的锦缎，就好像她想要把它毁了一样，还到处跺脚，愤怒地大喊大叫。
Now, all this time Prince Asmund and his sister sat in their trees just outside the window and saw all that was going on.	此时，阿斯木得王子和他的妹妹就坐在窗外的树里，看到了发生的一切。
‘Dear Signy,’ said Asmund, ‘do try to get hold of that piece of brocade and make the clothes yourself, for really we shall have no rest day or night with such a noise.’	“亲爱的西格尼，”阿斯木得说，“你得想办法拿到那匹锦缎，然后用它做身衣裳。在这样的噪音下，我们无论白天晚上都不得安宁。”
‘I will try,’ said Signy; ‘it won’t be an easy matter, but it’s worth while taking some trouble to have a little peace.’	“我会尽力的，”西格尼说，“这可不是件容易的事，但是只要能得到一丝安宁，麻烦点儿也是值得的。”
So she watched for an opportunity and managed to carry off the brocade the first time the witch left her room.	于是她开始伺机而动。在女巫第一次离开房间的时候，她成功拿走了那匹锦缎。
Then she set to work, cutting out and sewing as best she could, and by the end of six days she had turned it into an elegant robe with a long train and a mantle.	之后她便开始工作，尽心尽力地裁剪和缝制。六天后，她把它变成了一件优雅的长裙，有着长长的裙裾和一个斗篷。
When it was finished she climbed to the top of her tree and contrived to throw the clothes on to a table through the open window.	当她完成了这件衣服，她爬到她那棵树的顶端，然后设法将衣服从窗户扔到了桌子上。
How delighted the witch was when she found the clothes all finished!	当女巫发现这件完工了的衣服，她是多么的高兴啊！
The next time Prince Ring came to see her she gave them to him, and he paid her many compliments on her skilful work, after which he took leave of her in the most friendly manner.	林王子又一次来看她的时候，她把它们拿给他看，他对她灵巧的手艺赞不绝口。之后，他以极其友好的方式向她告辞。
But he had scarcely left the house when the witch began to rage as furiously as ever, and never stopped till her brother Ironhead appeared.	然而他几乎还没离开房子，女巫就同以往一样，开始猛烈地暴怒，直到她的铁皮哥哥出现才停息。
When Asmund saw all these wild doings from his tree he felt he could no longer keep silence.	阿斯木得从他的树里看到这些疯狂的举动，他觉得他不能再保持沉默了。
He went to Prince Ring and said: ‘Do come with me and see the strange things that are happening in the new princess’s room.’	他去找到林王子，说：“跟我来，去看看新公主的房间里发生的奇怪事情。”
The prince was not a little surprised, but he consented to hide himself with Asmund behind the panelling of the room, from where they could see all that went on through a little slit.	王子非常惊讶，但是他还是同意和阿斯木得一起躲在房间的镶板背后。在那里，他们能透过小裂缝看到里面发生的一切。
The witch was raving and roaring as usual, and said to her brother:	女巫和往常一样怒吼咆哮，并对她的哥哥说：
‘Once I am married to the king’s son I shall be better off than now.	“一旦我和国王的儿子结婚，我就会比现在更加富裕。
I shall take care to have all that pack of courtiers put to death, and then I shall send for all my relations to come and live here instead.	我一定要铲除那群谄媚的人，然后把我所有的亲戚都接到这儿来住。
I fancy the giants will enjoy themselves very much with me and my husband.’	我想巨人们会和我还有我的丈夫相处得很好。”
When Prince Ring heard this he fell into such a rage that he ordered the house to be set on fire, and it was burnt to the ground, with the witch and her brother in it.	听到这些，林王子勃然大怒，立刻下令烧了这座房子，女巫和她的哥哥在里面同房子一起被烧成了灰烬。
Asmund then told the prince about the two oak trees and took him to see them.	后来阿斯木得跟王子提到了两棵橡树，并带他去看它们。
The prince was quite astonished at them and at all their contents, but still more so at the extreme beauty of Signy.	王子对这两棵橡树及它们的内部构造感到十分稀奇，却更加惊讶于西格尼无与伦比的美丽。
He fell in love with her at once, and entreated her to marry him, which, after a time, she consented to do.	他立刻爱上了她，并且恳求她嫁给他。过了一段时间之后，她答应了。
Asmund, on his side, asked for the hand of Prince Ring’s sister, which was gladly granted him, and the double wedding was celebrated with great rejoicings.	阿斯木得则想向林王子的妹妹求婚，林王子欣然允许了，于是他们举行了一场欢欣鼓舞的双婚礼。
After this Prince Asmund and his bride returned to his country to live with the king his father.	之后，阿斯木得王子和他的新娘一起回到他的国家，和国王父亲生活在一起。
The two couples often met, and lived happily for many, many years.	两对夫妻经常见面，他们幸福地生活了很多很多年。
And that is the end of the story.	这就是故事的结尾。
