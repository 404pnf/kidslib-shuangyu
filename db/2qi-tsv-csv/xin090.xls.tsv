Hansel and Grettel	汉塞尔与格莱特
by Andrew Lang	作者：安德鲁·朗格
Once upon a time there dwelt on the outskirts of a large forest a poor woodcutter with his wife and two children; the boy was called Hansel and the girl Grettel.	从前，在大森林的郊外住着一个贫穷的樵夫和他的妻子，他们有两个孩子，男孩叫汉塞尔，女孩叫格莱特。
He had always little enough to live on, and once, when there was a great famine in the land, he couldn’t even provide them with daily bread.	他常常难以维持生计，一次，全国闹起了大饥荒，他甚至没法让家人每天都吃上面包。
One night, as he was tossing about in bed, full of cares and worry, he sighed and said to his wife: “What’s to become of us? how are we to support our poor children, now that we have nothing more for ourselves?”	一天夜里，他在床上辗转反侧，忧虑重重，一边叹气一边对他的妻子说：“我们要怎么办呢？既然我们自己都没有吃的，又该怎样去抚养我们可怜的孩子呢？”
“I’ll tell you what, husband,” answered the woman; “early to-morrow morning we’ll take the children out into the thickest part of the wood; there we shall light a fire for them and give them each a piece of bread; then we’ll go on to our work and leave them alone.	“听我说，孩子他爹，”女人回答道，“明天一大清早我们就把孩子带到森林里树木最密集的地方，在那儿，我们给他们生一堆火，再给他们一人一块面包，然后我们会继续干我们的活，把他们单独留在那儿。
They won’t be able to find their way home, and we shall thus be rid of them.”	他们无法找到回家的路，这样咱们就能摆脱他们了。”
“No, wife,” said her husband, “that I won’t do; how could I find it in my heart to leave my children alone in the wood?	“不行啊，老婆，”她的丈夫说道，“我不会那样做的，我怎么能忍心把自己的孩子独自留在森林里呢？
The wild beasts would soon come and tear them to pieces.”	野兽很快会过去把他们撕成碎片的。”
“Oh! you fool,” said she, “then we must all four die of hunger, and you may just as well go and plane the boards for our coffins”; and she left him no peace till he consented.	“唉，你这个傻瓜，”她答道，“不这样的话，我们四个都会饿死的，你索性就给我们刨一刨做棺材的木板好了。”接着，她又说个不停，没让她老公消停片刻，直到他点头答应。
“But I can’t help feeling sorry for the poor children,” added the husband.	“可是我总是觉得这样做太对不起可怜的孩子们了。”丈夫又说道。
The children, too, had not been able to sleep for hunger, and had heard what their step-mother had said to their father.	孩子们由于饥饿也无法入睡，他们听到了继母和父亲的对话。
Grettel wept bitterly and spoke to Hansel: “Now it’s all up with us.”	格莱特伤心地哭着，对汉塞尔说：“现在我们可完蛋了。”
“No, no, Grettel,” said Hansel, “don’t fret yourself; I’ll be able to find a way to escape, no fear.”	“不，不，格莱特，”汉塞尔说道，“不要自寻烦恼了，我会想办法逃脱的，不要害怕。”
And when the old people had fallen asleep he got up, slipped on his little coat, opened the back door and stole out.	等大人睡着后，他便起床穿上小外套，打开后门，偷偷溜了出去。
The moon was shining clearly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house glittered like bits of silver.	月光皎洁，照得门前的白色石子闪闪发光，就像一块块小银币。
Hansel bent down and filled his pocket with as many of them as he could cram in.	汉塞尔弯下腰，竭力在自己的口袋里塞满石子。
Then he went back and said to Grettel: “Be comforted, my dear little sister, and go to sleep: God will not desert us”; and he lay down in bed again.	然后，他回去对格莱特说：“放心吧，我亲爱的小妹，你去睡觉吧，上帝不会抛弃我们的。”说完，他便躺回床上睡觉。
At daybreak, even before the sun was up, the woman came and woke the two children: “Get up, you lie-abeds, we’re all going to the forest to fetch wood.”	黎明时分，太阳都还没出来，那个女人就来叫醒两个孩子：“快起床，你们这两个懒虫，我们几个都要去森林里拾柴火。”
She gave them each a bit of bread and said: “There’s something for your luncheon, but don’t you eat it up before, for it’s all you’ll get.”	她给他们每人一小块面包，并告诉他们：“这是你们的午饭，可别太早吃完了，你们只能得到这么多。”
Grettel took the bread under her apron, as Hansel had the stones in his pocket.	格莱特把面包放在了围裙底下，因为汉塞尔的口袋里装满了石子。
Then they all set out together on the way to the forest.	然后，他们全家人一起动身去森林。
After they had walked for a little, Hansel stood still and looked back at the house, and this maneuver he repeated again and again.	他们走了一小会儿后，汉塞尔便停下来回头看看房子，而且一再地重复这个动作。
His father observed him, and said: “Hansel, what are you gazing at there, and why do you always remain behind?	他的父亲发现了，便说：“汉塞尔，你到底在往那边瞅什么，为什么你老是走在后面？
Take care, and don’t lose your footing.”	小心，别走丢了。”
“Oh! father,” said Hansel, “I am looking back at my white kitten, which is sitting on the roof, waving me a farewell.”	“噢！爸爸，”汉塞尔回答说，“我在回头看我的小白猫呢，它正蹲在屋顶上和我挥手道别呢！”
The woman exclaimed: “What a donkey you are! that isn’t your kitten, that’s the morning sun shining on the chimney.”	继母喊道：“真是头笨驴，那不是你的小猫，那是在烟囱上闪耀的朝阳。”
But Hansel had not looked back at his kitten, but had always dropped one of the white pebbles out of his pocket on to the path.	然而汉塞尔并没有回头看自己的小猫，而是一直从口袋里掏出白色的小石子，一颗一颗地扔在走过的路上。
When they had reached the middle of the forest the father said: “Now, children, go and fetch a lot of wood, and I’ll light a fire that you may not feel cold.”	当他们到了森林中央时，父亲说道：“孩子们，现在你们去多捡些木头来，我给你们生一堆火，这样你们就不会冻着了。”
Hansel and Grettel heaped up brushwood till they had made a pile nearly the size of a small hill.	汉塞尔和格莱特将拾来的枯枝堆了起来，直到堆得几乎有一座小山那么高。
The brushwood was set fire to, and when the flames leaped high the woman said: “Now lie down at the fire, children, and rest yourselves: we are going into the forest to cut down wood; when we’ve finished we’ll come back and fetch you.”	他们点燃了枯枝，当火焰高高升起的时候，继母就对他们说：“孩子们，现在你们俩给我躺到火堆边上，好好休息。我和你们的爸爸要到森林里去砍柴，等我们干完活就回来接你们。”
Hansel and Grettel sat down beside the fire, and at midday ate their little bits of bread.	汉塞尔和格莱特坐在火堆旁边，到中午的时候，他们就吃掉了那一小点儿面包。
They heard the strokes of the axe, so they thought their father was quite near.	他们听到斧头砍树的声音，所以就认为他们的父亲就在不远的地方。
But it was no axe they heard, but a bough he had tied on a dead tree, and that was blown about by the wind.	但是他们听见的根本不是斧头的声音，而是父亲绑在一棵枯树上的树枝，被风吹过发出的声音。
And when they had sat for a long time their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep.	他们已经坐了很久，累得连眼睛都睁不开了，很快便睡着了。
When they awoke at last it was pitch dark.	等他们终于醒来时，四周已经漆黑一片了。
Grettel began to cry, and said: “How are we ever to get out of the wood?”	格雷特开始哭了起来，说：“我们要怎么走出森林啊？”
But Hansel comforted her.	但是汉塞尔安慰她。
“Wait a bit,” he said, “till the moon is up, and then we’ll find our way sure enough.”	“先等等，”他说，“等到月亮升起的时候，我们就一定能找到回家的路。”
And when the full moon had risen he took his sister by the hand and followed the pebbles, which shone like new threepenny bits, and showed them the path.	当满月升起来时，他拉着妹妹的手，顺着那些像崭新的三便士的硬币一样闪烁的小石子指引的路走着。
They walked on through the night, and at daybreak reached their father’s house again.	他们走了一整夜，在黎明的时候终于再次到达他们父亲的家门口。
They knocked at the door, and when the woman opened it she exclaimed: “You naughty children, what a time you’ve slept in the wood! we thought you were never going to come back.”	他们敲了敲门，给他们开门的是那个女人，她惊呼道：“你们这两个顽皮的孩子，在森林里睡得可真够久的！我们还以为你们永远也不会回来了呢！”
But the father rejoiced, for his conscience had reproached him for leaving his children behind by themselves.	但是父亲感到惊喜不已，因为他因为离弃自己的孩子而受到了良心的谴责。
Not long afterward there was again great dearth in the land, and the children heard their mother address their father thus in bed one night: “Everything is eaten up once more; we have only half a loaf in the house, and when that’s done it’s all up with us.	这之后不久，全国又闹大饥荒，一天夜里，孩子们听见继母在床上对他们的父亲说：“食物又全部吃光了，家里只剩下半个面包了，吃完了这个后我们就完蛋了。
The children must be got rid of; we’ll lead them deeper into the wood this time, so that they won’t be able to find their way out again.	必须把孩子们给扔掉，这次我们要带他们去更深的森林里去，这样他们就肯定找不到回家的路了。
There is no other way of saving ourselves.”	没有其他的办法来拯救我们自己了。”
The man’s heart smote him heavily, and he thought: “Surely it would be better to share the last bite with one’s children!”	樵夫的心灵受到重创，心想，能与自己的孩子分享最后一口面包无疑是更好的！
But his wife wouldn’t listen to his arguments, and did nothing but scold and reproach him.	但是他的妻子不会听他的辩解，只会一味地责骂和训斥他。
If a man yields once he’s done for, and so, because he had given in the first time, he was forced to do so the second.	如果一个男人曾经屈服过，因为有了第一次让步，他就不得不做出第二次让步。
But the children were awake, and had heard the conversation.	然而，孩子们仍未入睡，并且听到了这次谈话。
When the old people were asleep Hansel got up, and wanted to go out and pick up pebbles again, as he had done the first time; but the woman had barred the door, and Hansel couldn’t get out.	等大人们都睡着的时候，汉塞尔从床上爬起来，又想象第一次那样，出去捡石子。但是这次继母把门给锁上了，汉塞尔没法出去。
But he consoled his little sister, and said: “Don’t cry, Grettel, and sleep peacefully, for God is sure to help us.”	但是他安慰他的小妹说：“别哭，格莱特，安心睡觉吧，上帝一定会帮助咱们的。”
At early dawn the woman came and made the children get up.	黎明时分，继母来了，把孩子们给叫了起来。
They received their bit of bread, but it was even smaller than the time before.	他们得到了一小点儿面包，可是比上回还要小。
On the way to the wood Hansel crumbled it in his pocket, and every few minutes he stood still and dropped a crumb on the ground.	在去森林的路上，汉塞尔在口袋里捏碎了面包，隔几分钟便会停下来，把面包屑撒在路上。
“Hansel, what are you stopping and looking about for?” said the father.	“汉塞尔，你停下来到底在找什么？”他的父亲问道。
“I’m looking back at my little pigeon, which is sitting on the roof waving me a farewell,” answered Hansel.	“我在回头看我的小鸽子，它正站在屋顶上和我道别呢。”汉塞尔答道。
“Fool!” said the wife; “that isn’t your pigeon, it’s the morning sun glittering on the chimney.”	“笨蛋！”继母喊道，“那不是你的鸽子，那是在烟囱上闪烁的朝阳。”
But Hansel gradually threw all his crumbs on the path.	但是汉塞尔还是慢慢地在路上撒下了面包屑。
The woman led the children still deeper into the forest farther than they had ever been in their lives before.	继母领着孩子们去向森林更深更远的地方，他们一辈子都没去过的地方。
Then a big fire was lit again, and the mother said: “Just sit down there, children, and if you’re tired you can sleep a bit; we’re going into the forest to cut down wood, and in the evening when we’re finished we’ll come back to fetch you.”	然后，一大堆火又被生了起来，继母说：“就在那坐着，孩子们，如果觉得累了，可以小睡一会儿。我们要去森林里砍柴，等我们干完活晚上就回来接你们。”
At midday Grettel divided her bread with Hansel, for he had strewn his all along their path.	中午的时候，格雷特把她的面包和汉塞尔分着吃，因为他把自己的面包都撒在路上了。
Then they fell asleep, and evening passed away, but nobody came to the poor children.	然后，他们俩睡着了，傍晚过去了，但是仍然没人来接两个可怜的孩子。
They didn’t awake till it was pitch dark, and Hansel comforted his sister, saying: “Only wait, Grettel, till the moon rises, then we shall see the bread-crumbs I scattered along the path; they will show us the way back to the house.”	等到他们醒来时已经漆黑一片，汉塞尔安慰他的妹妹说：“等等就好，格莱特，等月亮升起时我们就能看清撒在沿途的面包屑，它们一定会指示我们回家的路。”
When the moon appeared they got up, but they found no crumbs, for the thousands of birds that fly about the woods and fields had picked them all up.	当月亮升起时他们站起身，但是却找不到面包屑了，因为那些在森林里和田野上飞来飞去的成千上万只鸟儿已经把它们吃光了。
“Never mind,” said Hansel to Grettel; “you’ll see we’ll find a way out”; but all the same they did not.	“不要紧，”汉塞尔对格雷特说道，“你会看见我们是能找到回家的路的。”可是他们仍然没能找到。
They wandered about the whole night, and the next day, from morning till evening, but they could not find a path out of the wood.	他们一整夜都在四处游荡，第二天也是如此，从早到晚，他们也没能找到走出森林的路。
They were very hungry, too, for they had nothing to eat but a few berries they found growing on the ground.	他们也觉得很饿，因为除了在地上找到的几颗野生浆果外，他们什么也没吃。
And at last they were so tired that their legs refused to carry them any longer, so they lay down under a tree and fell fast asleep.	最终，他们累得连脚都没法移动了，就躺在一棵树下，很快睡着了。
On the third morning after they had left their father’s house they set about their wandering again, but only got deeper and deeper into the wood, and now they felt that if help did not come to them soon they must perish.	离开父亲家的第三天早晨，他们又开始游荡，但却只是往森林里越走越远而已，现在他们觉得如果再得不到帮助的话，自己很快就会死去。
At midday they saw a beautiful little snow-white bird sitting on a branch, which sang so sweetly that they stopped still and listened to it.	中午的时候，他们看到一只漂亮的雪白的小鸟站在树枝上唱歌，它的歌声是如此动听，引得兄妹两人都停下来听它唱。
And when its song was finished it flapped its wings and flew on in front of them.	它唱完歌后，便扑腾着翅膀飞到了他们面前。
They followed it and came to a little house, on the roof of which it perched; and when they came quite near they saw that the cottage was made of bread and roofed with cakes, while the window was made of transparent sugar.	他们跟着小鸟走，来到了一幢小屋前，它停在了屋顶上。等他们走近时才发现小屋是用面包做的，屋顶是蛋糕做的，而窗户则是透明的糖果。
“Now we’ll set to,” said Hansel, “and have a regular blow-out. 	“现在我们尽情开吃吧！”汉塞尔说道，“吃到撑破肚皮。
I’ll eat a bit of the roof, and you, Grettel, can eat some of the window, which you’ll find a sweet morsel.”	我要吃一小块屋顶，格莱特，你可以吃点儿窗户，你会尝到一点儿甜甜的美味。”
Hansel stretched up his hand and broke off a little bit of the roof to see what it was like, and Grettel went to the casement and began to nibble at it.	汉塞尔伸出他的手，掰了一小块屋顶，想尝尝它究竟味道怎样，而格莱特去了窗前，开始啃起了窗户。
Thereupon a shrill voice called out from the room inside:	这时，从屋子里传出一个尖厉的声音：
“Nibble, nibble, little mouse,	“啃啊！啃啊！小耗子，
Who’s nibbling my house?”	谁在啃我的房子？”
The children answered:	孩子们答道：
“Tis Heaven’s own child,	“是上帝的孩子，
The tempest wild,”	是暴风。”
and went on eating, without putting themselves about.	说完接着毫无顾忌地吃着。
Hansel, who thoroughly appreciated the roof, tore down a big bit of it, while Grettel pushed out a whole round window-pane, and sat down the better to enjoy it.	汉塞尔充分享受到屋顶的美味，便又掰下一大块，而格莱特也推出一整块圆窗，更舒服地坐着享用。
Suddenly the door opened, and an ancient dame leaning on a staff hobbled out.	突然，房门开了，一位年老的妇人拄着拐杖蹒跚地走了出来。
Hansel and Grettel were so terrified that they let what they had in their hands fall.	汉塞尔和格莱特害怕极了，以至于手里的食物都掉在了地上。
But the old woman shook her head and said: “Oh, ho! you dear children, who led you here?	但是这个老妇人摇了摇头说：“噢，亲爱的孩子们，是谁带你们来这儿的？
Just come in and stay with me, no ill shall befall you.”	进来吧，和我呆在一起，厄运不会降临到你们身上的。”
She took them both by the hand and let them into the house, and laid a most sumptuous dinner before them—milk and sugared pancakes, with apples and nuts.	她牵着兄妹俩的手，让他们进了屋子，并为他们准备了一顿极其丰盛的晚餐，孩子们的面前摆着牛奶、糖饼、苹果和坚果。
After they had finished, two beautiful little white beds were prepared for them, and when Hansel and Grettel lay down in them they felt as if they had got into heaven.	等他们吃完后，她又为他们准备了两张漂亮的白色小床。当汉塞尔和格莱特躺在床上时，马上觉得像是进了天堂一般。
The old woman had appeared to be most friendly, but she was really an old witch who had waylaid the children, and had only built the little bread house in order to lure them in.	老妇人看似无比友善，其实她是一个真正的老巫婆，专门引诱孩子上当。她建这座房子就是为了引诱他们落入圈套。
When anyone came into her power she killed, cooked, and ate him, and held a regular feast-day for the occasion.	任何一个小孩落入她的魔掌，她就会杀了他，把他煮熟了吃掉，还要按照惯例设宴庆祝一番。
Now witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but, like beasts, they have a keen sense of smell, and know when human beings pass by.	现在的巫婆都有着一双红色的眼睛，而且视力不好，但是她们的嗅觉却像野兽一样灵敏，而且能嗅到经过的人类。
When Hansel and Grettel fell into her hands she laughed maliciously, and said jeeringly: “I’ve got them now; they sha’n’t escape me.”	当汉塞尔和格莱特落入她的魔掌时，她恶毒地大笑起来，讥笑道：“我抓到他们了，他们休想跑掉。”
Early in the morning, before the children were awake, she rose up, and when she saw them both sleeping so peacefully, with their round rosy cheeks, she muttered to herself: “That’ll be a dainty bite.”	第二天一大清早，还没等孩子们睡醒，她就起床了。她见他们俩睡得如此平静，圆圆的脸蛋红彤彤的，不由得喃喃自语：“吃起来肯定美味极了。”
Then she seized Hansel with her bony hand and carried him into a little stable, and barred the door on him; he might scream as much as he liked, it did him no good.	然后她用她那瘦骨嶙峋的手抓起汉塞尔，扛着他进了一间小马厩，并把门锁了起来，把他关在里面。他或许会放声尖叫，但这无济于事。
Then she went to Grettel, shook her till she awoke, and cried: “Get up, you lazy-bones, fetch water and cook something for your brother.	接着她去格莱特那里，把她摇醒，大喊道：“起来，你这个懒骨头，去打水给你哥哥煮些吃的。
When he’s fat I’ll eat him up.”	等他长胖了我要把他吃掉。”
Grettel began to cry bitterly, but it was of no use; she had to do what the wicked witch bade her.	格莱特伤心地哭了起来，但这没用，她必须得按邪恶的巫婆命令的去做。
So the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Grettel got nothing but crab-shells.	于是，可怜的汉塞尔吃着煮熟的最好的食物，而格莱特只能吃蟹壳。
Every morning the old woman hobbled out to the stable and cried: “Hansel, put out your finger, that I may feel if you are getting fat.”	每天早晨，老妇人都会颤颤巍巍地走到马厩前，吼道：“汉塞尔，把你的手指伸出来，让我摸摸你长胖没。”
But Hansel always stretched out a bone, and the old dame, whose eyes were dim, couldn’t see it, and thinking always it was Hansel’s finger, wondered why he fattened so slowly.	但是汉塞尔总是伸出一根骨头，视力不好的老巫婆看不清楚，一直以为那是汉塞尔的手指，她不禁感到疑惑，为什么他长不胖呢？
When four weeks had passed and Hansel still remained thin, she lost patience and determined to wait no longer.	四周过去了，汉塞尔依然很瘦，她失去了耐心，决定不再等了。
“Hi, Grettel,” she called to the girl, “be quick and get some water.	“喂，格莱特，”她对女孩喊道，“快去弄点儿水来。
Hansel may be fat or thin, I’m going to kill him to-morrow and cook him.”	不管汉塞尔是胖是瘦，明天我都要杀了他，把他给煮了。”
Oh! how the poor little sister sobbed as she carried the water, and how the tears rolled down her cheeks!	唉！可怜的小妹提着水抽泣着，眼泪顺着脸颊往下掉。
“Kind heaven help us now!” she cried; “if only the wild beasts in the wood had eaten us, then at least we should have died together.”	“仁慈的上帝啊，帮帮我们吧！”她呼喊道，“要是当时森林里的野兽把我们给吃了该有多好，至少我们还是死在一起的。”
“Just hold your peace,” said the old hag; “it won’t help you.”	“给我住嘴，”老巫婆吼道，“上帝不会帮你的。”
Early in the morning Grettel had to go out and hang up the kettle full of water, and light the fire.	第二天一大清早，格莱特就得出去把装满水的水壶挂起来，生火煮水。
“First we’ll bake,” said the old dame; “I’ve heated the oven already and kneaded the dough.”	“我们要先烤面包，”老巫婆说道，“我已经给烤炉加热了，面团也和好了。”
She pushed Grettel out to the oven, from which fiery flames were already issuing.	她把格莱特推到炉子前，炙热的火焰已经从炉里喷涌而出。
“Creep in,” said the witch, “and see if it’s properly heated, so that we can shove in the bread.”	“爬进去，”巫婆说道，“看看温度是否合适，那样我们就可以把面包放进去了。”
For when she had got Grettel in she meant to close the oven and let the girl bake, that she might eat her up too.	因为她打算等格莱特进去时，就关上烤炉，把女孩给烤熟，这样也许能把她也吃了。
But Grettel perceived her intention, and said: “I don’t know how I’m to do it; how do I get in?”	但是格莱特察觉到了她的意图，于是说：“我不知道怎么进去，我要怎么进去呢？”
“You silly goose!” said the hag, “the opening is big enough; see, I could get in myself,” and she crawled toward it, and poked her head into the oven.	“你这只蠢鹅！”老巫婆喊道，“这炉门够大的了，你看，我都能进去。”于是，她朝烤炉爬去，把头伸进了烤炉。
Then Grettel gave her a shove that sent her right in, shut the iron door, and drew the bolt.	就在那时，格莱特推了她一把，恰好推她进了烤炉，马上关上了铁门，拴好门栓。
Gracious! how she yelled, it was quite horrible; but Grettel fled, and the wretched old woman was left to perish miserably.	天哪！她的尖叫真是太恐怖了。但是格莱特逃脱了，而邪恶的老妇人只能悲惨地死去。
Grettel flew straight to Hansel, opened the little stable-door, and cried: “Hansel, we are free; the old witch is dead.”	格莱特立刻飞奔到汉塞尔那里，打开小马厩门，哭着喊道：“汉塞尔，我们自由了，老巫婆死了。”
Then Hansel sprang like a bird out of a cage when the door is opened.	门一开，汉塞尔便像脱笼的小鸟一样蹿了出来。
How they rejoiced, and fell on each other’s necks, and jumped for joy, and kissed one another!	他们多么欢喜啊，拥抱彼此，激动地跳着，亲吻着彼此。
And as they had no longer any cause for fear, they went in the old hag’s house, and here they found, in every corner of the room, boxes with pearls and precious stones.	因为他们没什么好害怕的了，便回到老巫婆的房子里，在房子里的每个角落都发现了成箱的珍珠和宝石。
“These are even better than pebbles,” said Hansel, and crammed his pockets full of them; and Grettel said: “I too will bring something home,” and she filled her apron full.	“这些可比石子珍贵多了，”汉塞尔说道，在口袋里塞满了珍珠和宝石。“我也要带些东西回家。”格莱特说，同时也在自己的围裙里装满了珠宝。
“But now,” said Hansel, “let’s go and get well away from the witch’s wood.”	“现在，”汉塞尔说道，“赶紧走吧，离开这个女巫的森林吧。”
When they had wandered about for some hours they came to a big lake.	他们走了几个小时后来到了一个大湖前面。
“We can’t get over,” said Hansel; “I see no bridge of any sort or kind.”	“我们没法过去，”汉塞尔说，“我一座桥都没看到。”
“Yes, and there’s no ferry-boat either,” answered Grettel; “but look, there swims a white duck; if I ask her she’ll help us over,” and she called out:	“是啊，这儿也没有渡船，”格莱特答道，“但是你看，那有一只白鸭子，我可以请它帮咱们过去。”于是，她喊道：
“Here are two children, mournful very,	“这儿有两个十分悲惨的孩子，
Seeing neither bridge nor ferry;	没看到桥，也没看到船；
Take us upon your white back,	把我们载到你那洁白的背上吧，
And row us over, quack, quack!”	载我们过去，呱，呱！”
The duck swam toward them, and Hansel got on her back and bade his little sister sit beside him.	鸭子向他们游了过来，汉塞尔坐到了它的背上，招呼他的小妹坐到他身旁。
“No,” answered Grettel, “we should be too heavy a load for the duck: she shall carry us across separately.”	“不，”格莱特答道，“我们俩一起过湖太沉了，她应该分开载我们过去。”
The good bird did this, and when they were landed safely on the other side, and had gone for a while, the wood became more and more familiar to them, and at length they saw their father’s house in the distance.	善良的鸭子载他们过了湖，等他们安全到达湖的对岸，走了一会儿后，森林里的一切变得熟悉起来，最终他们远远地看到了父亲的房子。
Then they set off to run, and bounding into the room fell on their father’s neck.	然后，他们开始跑起来，跑进房子里拥抱他们的父亲。
The man had not passed a happy hour since he left them in the wood, but the woman had died.	自从他把孩子留在森林里，他就没过过一天好日子，但是孩子们的继母已经死了。
Grettel shook out her apron so that the pearls and precious stones rolled about the room, and Hansel threw down one handful after the other out of his pocket.	格莱特抖了抖围裙，珠宝撒了一地，而汉塞尔从他的口袋里掏出了一把又一把的珠宝。
Thus all their troubles were ended, and they lived happily ever afterward.	就这样，他们所有的麻烦都没有了，从此以后过上了幸福的生活。
My story is done.	我的故事讲完了。
