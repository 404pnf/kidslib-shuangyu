书名乔治·费希尔案件 （马克·吐温经典短篇小说）短简介19世纪，美国佛罗里达州的一个普通农场为何能产出133323.18美元的现金？费希尔家族在半个多世纪，一次又一次地包围美国国会，执著不懈地为祖先“遭到美国军队破坏”的财产进行索赔，屡屡取得成功，其中又有着怎样的故事？长简介《乔治·费希尔案件》将一个看似荒谬的故事娓娓道来：1813年9月1日，佛罗里达州公民乔治·费希尔先生的财产被印第安人和美国军队摧毁。二十年过去了，费希尔遗孀的新丈夫向国会提出了赔偿当年财产损失的要求，声称是美国军队毁掉了费希尔先生的财产，这一请愿遭到了国会的拒绝。十六年之后，费希尔家族继承人又一次向美国国会索赔，得到8873美元的赔偿。自此以后，在几十年间，费希尔家族便时常向国会索赔，国会审理通过的赔偿金额也一路扶摇直上，竟然达到了133323.18美元！马克·吐温在这篇小说中一如既往地广泛运用了反讽的笔法，文章短小精悍，读来妙趣横生。关键字乔治·费希尔案件；马克·吐温；外研社编译组；诈骗；美国国会；赔偿；贪婪作者（美）马克·吐温作者简介马克·吐温（1835—1910），19世纪后期美国批判现实主义文学的杰出代表，美国著名的幽默大师、小说家、作家及演说家。马克·吐温出身贫寒，从小历经诸多家庭不幸，幼年起就开始打工生涯，但这些都为他以后的文学创作累积了素材。他幽默、机智，擅长写讽刺小说。作品融幽默与讽刺于一体，既富于独特的个人机智与妙语，又不乏深刻的社会洞察与剖析，被誉为文学史上的林肯。书评海伦·凯勒曾言：“我喜欢马克·吐温——谁会不喜欢他呢？即使是上帝，亦会钟爱他，赋予其智慧，并于其心灵里绘画出一道爱与信仰的彩虹。”威廉·福克纳称马克·吐温为“第一位真正的美国作家，我们都是继承他而来”。
The Case of George Fisher	乔治·费希尔案
by Mark Twain	作者：马克·吐温
This is history.	这是一个真实的故事。
It is not a wild extravaganza, like “John Wilson Mackenzie’s Great Beef Contract,” but is a plain statement of facts and circumstances with which the Congress of the United States has interested itself from time to time during the long period of half a century.	这不是一篇像《约翰·威尔逊·麦肯齐的大宗牛肉合同》那样异想天开的故事，而是朴实无华地叙述了在长达半个世纪的时间里，时不时将美国国会卷入其中的一起真实案件。
I will not call this matter of George Fisher’s a great deathless and unrelenting swindle upon the government and people of the United States—for it has never been so decided, and I hold that it is a grave and solemn wrong for a writer to cast slurs or call names when such is the case—but will simply present the evidence and let the reader deduce his own verdict.	我不会称乔治·费希尔一案是对美国政府及其民众没完没了的无情诈骗——因为从未有人对此案作出过如此判决。我认为身为一名作家，在这种情况下就对此横加诽谤和谩骂，实在是重大而严肃的错误——我只会给出证据，让读者自行判断去吧。
Then we shall do nobody injustice, and our consciences shall be clear.	这样我们就不会冤枉任何人，也不会良心不安了。
1.On or about the 1st day of September, 1813, the Creek war being then in progress in Florida, the crops, herds, and houses of Mr. George Fisher, a citizen, were destroyed, either by the Indians or by the United States troops in pursuit of them.	1.大约是在1813年9月1日，佛罗里达州正进行着克里克战争，美国公民乔治·费希尔先生的庄稼、牲口、房屋都在战争中被摧毁了，要么是印第安人干的，要么是围追他们的美国军队干的。
By the terms of the law, if the Indians destroyed the property, there was no relief for Fisher; but if the troops destroyed it, the Government of the United States was debtor to Fisher for the amount involved.	按照法律条款，如果财产是被印第安人毁掉的，费希尔就得不到任何补偿；如果是美国军队摧毁的，美国政府就是债务人，要赔偿费希尔因此战所蒙受的损失。
George Fisher must have considered that the Indians destroyed the property, because, although he lived several years afterward, he does not appear to have ever made any claim upon the government.	乔治·费希尔应该认为是印第安人毁掉了他的财产，因为虽然战后他又活了好些年，却从未向政府索要任何赔偿。
In the course of time Fisher died, and his widow married again.	时光飞逝，费希尔去世，他的遗孀再婚。
And by and by, nearly twenty years after that dimly remembered raid upon Fisher’s corn-fields, the widow Fisher’s new husband petitioned Congress for pay for the property, and backed up the petition with many depositions and affidavits which purported to prove that the troops, and not the Indians, destroyed the property; that the troops, for some inscrutable reason, deliberately burned down “houses” (or cabins) valued at $600, the same belonging to a peaceable private citizen, and also destroyed various other property belonging to the same citizen.	年复一年，近20年过去了，人们渐渐淡忘了费希尔家的玉米田被毁一事，这时费希尔遗孀的新丈夫却向国会提交了请愿书，要求赔偿财产损失，还在请愿书后附上许多口供和宣誓书，证明是军队毁坏了财产，而非印第安人；证明军队是出于某些难以理解的原因，故意放火烧毁了价值600美元的“房屋”（或棚屋），他们还毁掉了这位公民的其他财产，而这些财产原本都属于这个温顺而寡言的公民。
But Congress declined to believe that the troops were such idiots (after overtaking and scattering a band of Indians proved to have been found destroying Fisher’s property) as to calmly continue the work of destruction themselves; and make a complete job of what the Indians had only commenced.	但国会不愿相信军队是这样的傻子，（在追上并驱散了一帮正在毁坏费希尔财产的印第安人之后）居然会自己动手，继续从容地进行破坏，把印第安人刚刚开了个头的事做完。
So Congress denied the petition of the heirs of George Fisher in 1832, and did not pay them a cent.	所以1832年，国会拒绝了乔治·费希尔继承人的请愿，没有赔偿他们一分钱。
We hear no more from them officially until 1848, sixteen years after their first attempt on the Treasury, and a full generation after the death of the man whose fields were destroyed.	直到1848年，我们才又从官方渠道听到一些消息。那时距费希尔一家第一次索赔已有16年之久，而距离被毁田地的主人去世也整整隔了一代人了。
The new generation of Fisher heirs then came forward and put in a bill for damages.	新一代费希尔继承人站了出来，并提交了一份损失账单。
The Second Auditor awarded them $8,873, being half the damage sustained by Fisher.	第二审计师批给他们8873美元，这是费希尔所蒙受损失的一半。
The Auditor said the testimony showed that at least half the destruction was done by the Indians “before the troops started in pursuit,” and of course the government was not responsible for that half.	审计师说，证词表明“在军队开始围追前”，印第安人就毁掉了至少一半财产，政府当然不应为那一半负责。
2. That was in April, 1848.	2.那时是1848年4月。
In December, 1848, the heirs of George Fisher, deceased, came forward and pleaded for a “revision” of their bill of damages.	1848年12月，已故的乔治·费希尔的继承人又站了出来，请求“修订”他们的损失账单。
The revision was made, but nothing new could be found in their favor except an error of $100 in the former calculation.	修订后，除了发现之前的计算中有100美元的误差，并没有什么对他们有利的新发现。
However, in order to keep up the spirits of the Fisher family, the Auditor concluded to go back and allow interest from the date of the first petition (1832) to the date when the bill of damages was awarded.	然而，为了振奋费希尔家族的士气，审计师决定从头算过，再给他们一笔利息，日期从第一次提交请愿书算起（1832年），到损失账单得到赔偿之日为止。
This sent the Fishers home happy with sixteen years’ interest on $8,873—the same amounting to $8,997.94.	这让费希尔一家高高兴兴地回去了，带着8873美元16年的利息——利息高达8997.94美元。
Total, $17,870.94.	连本带利一共是17870.94美元。
3. For an entire year the suffering Fisher family remained quiet—even satisfied, after a fashion.	3.整整一年，饱受苦难的费希尔一家保持沉默——甚至可以说，勉强还算满意。
Then they swooped down upon the government with their wrongs once more.	接着，他们再一次用自己的不幸突袭了政府。
That old patriot, Attorney-General Toucey, burrowed through the musty papers of the Fishers and discovered one more chance for the desolate orphans—interest on that original award of $8,873 from date of destruction of the property (1813) up to 1832!	司法部长托西是一名老爱国者，他翻出了费希尔家发霉的文件，又为这些凄惨的孤儿掘出了一线机会——最初偿付的8873美元的利息应从财产被毁之日（1813年）算起，至1832年为止。
Result, $10,004.89 for the indigent Fishers.	结果，贫穷的费希尔一家又得到10004.89美元。
So now we have: First, $8,873 damages; second, interest on it from 1832 to 1848, $8997.94; third, interest on it dated back to 1813, $10,004.89.	所以现在我们有：第一笔，8873美元赔偿费；第二笔，从1832年到1848年的利息，8997.94美元；第三笔，从1813年算起的利息，10004.89美元。
Total, $27,875.83!	总计：27875.83美元！
What better investment for a great-grandchild than to get the Indians to burn a corn-field for him sixty or seventy years before his birth, and plausibly lay it on lunatic United States troops?	在曾孙出生前六七十年，让印第安人一把火烧了玉米地，然后把这笔账巧妙地算在疯狂愚蠢的美国军队头上，还有什么投资比这更划算？
4. Strange as it may seem, the Fishers let Congress alone for five years—or, what is perhaps more likely, failed to make themselves heard by Congress for that length of time.	4.虽然看似奇怪，但费希尔一家竟然五年没有理会国会——或者，更有可能的是，他们在这段时间内没能让国会听到他们的声音。
But at last, in 1854, they got a hearing.	但最后，1854年，他们申请到了一场听证会。
They persuaded Congress to pass an act requiring the Auditor to re-examine their case.	他们说服国会通过了一项法案，要求审计师重审他们的案件。
But this time they stumbled upon the misfortune of an honest Secretary of the Treasury (Mr. James Guthrie), and he spoiled everything.	但这次他们撞上了霉运，碰到一位诚实的财政部长（詹姆斯·格思里先生），他把一切给毁了。
He said in very plain language that the Fishers were not only not entitled to another cent, but that those children of many sorrows and acquainted with grief had been paid too much already.	他明明白白地宣布，费希尔一家不但没有权利再多要一分钱，而且那些历经不幸、满心悲痛的孩子们得到的赔偿已经够多的了。
5. Therefore another interval of rest and silent ensued—an interval which lasted four years—viz till 1858.	5.因此，紧随其后的是一段平静的休整期——这段间歇持续了四年——即到1858年。
The “right man in the right place” was then Secretary of War—John B.Floyd, of peculiar renown!	那时的国防部长正是“人得其位，位得其人”的约翰·B. 弗洛伊德，这是一位德高望重的人！
Here was a master intellect; here was the very man to succor the suffering heirs of dead and forgotten Fisher.	这人聪明绝顶，是可以帮助已经逝去且已被遗忘的费希尔的继承人们脱离苦海的不二人选。
They came up from Florida with a rush—a great tidal wave of Fishers freighted with the same old musty documents about the same in immortal corn-fields of their ancestor.	他们匆匆从佛罗里达赶来——这是一股强大的费希尔族人潮，随身装着那份陈旧发霉的文献，那上面记载的仍是他们祖先那块不朽的玉米地。
They straight-way got an act passed transferring the Fisher matter from the dull Auditor to the ingenious Floyd.	他们轻轻松松就让一项法案通过，将费希尔一案从迟钝的审计师那里转到天才弗洛伊德手里。
What did Floyd do?	弗洛伊德做了什么？
He considered, therefore, that what they destroyed must have consisted of “the houses with all their contents, and the liquor” (the most trifling part of the destruction, and set down at only $3,200 all told), and that the government troops then drove them off and calmly proceeded to destroy—	因此，他认为印第安人毁掉的财产应该包括“房屋及屋内的所有物品，还有酒类”（这是被毁财产中最微不足道的一部分，总共才值3200美元），随后政府军队赶走他们，镇定自若地继续破坏了——
Two hundred and twenty acres of corn in the field, thirty-five acres of wheat, and nine hundred and eighty-six head of live stock!	田里220英亩玉米，35英亩小麦以及986头牲畜！
[What a singularly intelligent army we had in those days, according to Mr. Floyd—though not according to the Congress of 1832.]	（当年我们拥有一支多么聪明绝顶的军队，弗洛伊德先生这样说——不过1832年的国会并没这样说。）
So Mr. Floyd decided that the Government was not responsible for that $3,200 worth of rubbish which the Indians destroyed, but was responsible for the property destroyed by the troops—which property consisted of (I quote from the printed United States Senate document):	所以弗洛伊德先生决定，政府不为印第安人毁掉的价值3200美元的垃圾埋单，但会为军队破坏的财产埋单——包括（我摘自印好的美国参议院文件）：
Dollars 	单位：美元
Corn at Bassett’s Creek,         3,000 	巴西特溪流边的玉米：3000
Cattle,                       5,000 	牛： 5000
Stock hogs,                   1,050 	肉食猪： 1050
Drove hogs,                  1,204 	牧猪： 1204
Wheat,                      350 	小麦： 350
Hides,                      4,000 	兽皮： 4000
Corn on the Alabama River,     3,500 	亚拉巴马河边的玉米：　3500
Total,                      18,104 	总计： 18104
That sum, in his report, Mr. Floyd calls the “full value of the property destroyed by the troops.”	在报告中，弗洛伊德先生称以上数字是“军队毁掉的所有财产的价值”。
He allows that sum to the starving Fishers, TOGETHER WITH INTEREST FROM 1813.	他允许把这笔钱拨给挨饿的费希尔一家，同时还包括从1813年算起的利息。
From this new sum total the amounts already paid to the Fishers were deducted, and then the cheerful remainder (a fraction under forty thousand dollars) was handed to them and again they retired to Florida in a condition of temporary tranquillity.	从这个新数额中扣掉已付给费希尔一家的那部分，再把那让人欢喜雀跃的剩下的金额（总数不到四万美元）交给他们，他们又一次回到佛罗里达，度过了一段短暂的平静日子。
Their ancestor’s farm had now yielded them altogether nearly sixty-seven thousand dollars in cash.	他们祖先的农场现在已经产出共计近67000美元的现金。
6. Does the reader suppose that that was the end of it?	6.读者是否认为故事就此结束了呢？
Does he suppose those diffident Fishers were satisfied?	读者是否认为那羞怯的费希尔家族该满足了呢？
Let the evidence show.	让证据说话吧。
The Fishers were quiet just two years.	费希尔家族只安静了两年。
Then they came swarming up out of the fertile swamps of Florida with their same old documents, and besieged Congress once more.	然后，他们又爬出佛罗里达肥沃的沼泽，依旧带着那一份陈旧的文件，又一次包围了国会。
Congress capitulated on the 1st of June, 1860, and instructed Mr. Floyd to overhaul those papers again, and pay that bill.	1860年6月1日，国会投降，指示弗洛伊德先生重新详细检查那些文件，并付清账单。
A Treasury clerk was ordered to go through those papers and report to Mr. Floyd what amount was still due the emaciated Fishers.	一名财政部的办事员受命彻底检查那些文件，并向弗洛伊德先生报告，究竟还欠这些憔悴的费希尔们多少钱。
This clerk (I can produce him whenever he is wanted) discovered what was apparently a glaring and recent forgery in the paper; whereby a witness’s testimony as to the price of corn in Florida in 1813 was made to name double the amount which that witness had originally specified as the price!	这位办事员(只要需要，我能随时让他出面）发现了一份很明显是最近伪造的文件，那上面有个证人提到了1813年佛罗里达州玉米的价钱，那个假钱是他最初所开价钱的两倍！
The clerk not only called his superior’s attention to this thing, but in making up his brief of the case called particular attention to it in writing.	这位办事员不仅向他的上级报告了此事，而且在编制此案摘要时还写下了“特别关注”的字样。
That part of the brief never got before Congress, nor has Congress ever yet had a hint of forgery existing among the Fisher papers.	摘要的这部分从未被送到国会，国会也未曾得到费希尔文件中存在造假信息的暗示。
Nevertheless, on the basis of the double prices (and totally ignoring the clerk’s assertion that the figures were manifestly and unquestionably a recent forgery), Mr. Floyd remarks in his new report that “the testimony, particularly in regard to the corn crops, DEMANDS A MUCH HIGHER ALLOWANCE than any heretofore made by the Auditor or myself.”	然而，以双倍的价格为基础（尽管办事员坚称这些数字无疑明摆着是最近伪造的，但弗洛伊德先生对此置之不理），弗洛伊德先生在他的新报告中说：“这份证词，特别是和玉米作物有关的部分，要求的赔偿太高，远远高于审计师或我在这以前所做过的任何判决。”
So he estimates the crop at sixty bushels to the acre (double what Florida acres produce), and then virtuously allows pay for only half the crop, but allows two dollars and a half a bushel for that half, when there are rusty old books and documents in the Congressional library to show just what the Fisher testimony showed before the forgery—viz., that in the fall of 1813 corn was only worth from $1.25 to $1.50 a bushel.	于是他按照每英亩产60蒲式耳的庄稼估算（两倍于佛罗里达的亩产量），然后公道地赔偿了一半的庄稼，但那一半庄稼每蒲式耳值2.5美元。那时，国会图书馆里那些残破的旧书和文件都可证明费希尔伪造证词前所提到的那个价格——即在1813年秋季，玉米的价格仅在每蒲式耳1.25美元到1.50美元之间。
Having accomplished this, what does Mr. Floyd do next?	完成此事后，弗洛伊德先生接下来又做了些什么?
Mr. Floyd (“with an earnest desire to execute truly the legislative will,” as he piously remarks) goes to work and makes out an entirely new bill of Fisher damages, and in this new bill he placidly ignores the Indians altogether, puts no particle of the destruction of the Fisher property upon them, but, even repenting him of charging them with burning the cabins and drinking the whisky and breaking the crockery, lays the entire damage at the door of the imbecile United States troops down to the very last item!	弗洛伊德先生（“带着一股要真实体现法律意志的诚挚愿望”，他虔诚地说）又继续工作，整理出一份全新的费希尔损失账单。在这份新账单中，他平静地完全忽略了印第安人，一点儿也没有把毁坏费希尔财产的责任归咎于他们的意思，甚至为自己当年指控他们烧毁小屋、喝掉威士忌、打破陶器的行为感到后悔，他把每一笔账都算到愚笨的美国军队头上！
And not only that, but uses the forgery to double the loss of corn at “Bassett’s Creek,” and uses it again to absolutely treble the loss of corn on the “Alabama River.”	不仅如此，他还用伪造的价格把“巴西特溪流”旁的玉米的损失翻了一番，又用同样的手段把“亚拉巴马河”边的玉米的损失翻了两番。
This new and ably conceived and executed bill of Mr. Floyd’s figures up as follows (I copy again from the printed United States Senate document):	这份经弗洛伊德先生巧妙构思并执行的新账单内容如下（我再次摘自印好的美国参议院文件）：

He puts everything in this time.	这次，他把一切都算了进去。
He does not even allow that the Indians destroyed the crockery or drank the four dozen bottles of (currant) wine.	他甚至不认为印第安人毁坏了陶器，或喝掉了48瓶葡萄酒。
When it came to supernatural comprehensiveness in “gobbling,” John B. Floyd was without his equal, in his own or any other generation.	约翰·B. 弗洛伊德对“狼吞虎咽”一词展示出了超乎寻常的理解力，简直可称得上是前无古人后无来者。
Subtracting from the above total the $67,000 already paid to George Fisher’s implacable heirs, Mr. Floyd announced that the government was still indebted to them in the sum of sixty-six thousand five hundred and nineteen dollars and eighty-five cents, “which,” Mr. Floyd complacently remarks, “will be paid, accordingly, to the administrator of the estate of George Fisher, deceased, or to his attorney in fact.”	从上述总金额中扣去已付给乔治·费希尔那难以安抚的继承人的67,000美元，弗洛伊德先生宣布政府仍欠他们总计66591.85美元的债务。“这笔钱”，他满意地说，“按照惯例，将会付给已故的乔治·费希尔的财产管理人，或他的委托代理人。”
But, sadly enough for the destitute orphans, a new President came in just at this time, Buchanan and Floyd went out, and they never got their money.	但是，令这些穷困潦倒的孤儿们十分悲伤的是，一位新总统正好在这时上台了，布坎南和弗洛伊德下台了，他们再也没能拿到那笔钱。
The first thing Congress did in 1861 was to rescind the resolution of June 1, 1860, under which Mr. Floyd had been ciphering.	1861年，国会做的第一件事就是废除1860年6月1日由弗洛伊德先生签署的决议。
Then Floyd (and doubtless the heirs of George Fisher likewise) had to give up financial business for a while, and go into the Confederate army and serve their country.	后来弗洛伊德（毫无疑问乔治·费希尔的继承人也是）不得不暂时放弃财务上的事宜，加入同盟军队为国家而战。
Were the heirs of George Fisher killed?	乔治·费希尔的继承人都战死了吗？
No.	没有。
They are back now at this very time (July, 1870), beseeching Congress through that blushing and diffident creature, Garrett Davis, to commence making payments again on their interminable and insatiable bill of damages for corn and whisky destroyed by a gang of irresponsible Indians, so long ago that even government red-tape has failed to keep consistent and intelligent track of it.	他们在这一恰当的时刻（1870年7月）又回来了，借助爱脸红、羞怯的加勒特·戴维斯之力，他们恳求国会重新对他们那被一帮不负责任的印第安人毁坏的玉米地和威士忌账单进行赔偿——这份账单绵延不尽，永远无法被满足。这是多少年前的事了，连政府的繁缛公文都未能将其前后一致、条理清晰地记录下来。
Now the above are facts.	到此为止，以上所述皆为事实。
They are history.	它们都是真实的故事。
Any one who doubts it can send to the Senate Document Department of the Capitol for H. R. Ex. Doc. No. 21, 36th Congress, 2d Session; and for S. Ex. Doc. No. 106, 41st Congress, 2d Session, and satisfy himself.	任何怀疑此事真实性的人都可到美国国会大厦参议院档案室，查找第36届国会第2次会议众议院第21号行政文件和第41届国会第2次会议参议院第106号行政文件，便可知真假。
The whole case is set forth in the first volume of the Court of Claims Reports.	全部案情收录于《法院索赔报告》第一卷中。
It is my belief that as long as the continent of America holds together, the heirs of George Fisher, deceased, will still make pilgrimages to Washington from the swamps of Florida, to plead for just a little more cash on their bill of damages (even when they received the last of that sixty-seven thousand dollars, they said it was only one fourth what the government owed them on that fruitful corn-field), and as long as they choose to come they will find Garrett Davises to drag their vampire schemes before Congress.	我相信，只要美洲大陆还连在一块，已故的乔治·费希尔的后人仍会从佛罗里达的沼泽地里爬出，踏上前往华盛顿的朝拜旅途，请求再多给他们一点儿损失赔偿费（当他们最近一次拿到那笔67,000美元的付款时，他们竟然说这只是政府欠他们那块富饶的玉米地的债务的四分之一），只要他们选择过来，他们就能找加勒特·戴维斯把他们那如吸血鬼般邪恶的计划带到国会去。
This is not the only hereditary fraud (if fraud it is—which I have before repeatedly remarked is not proven) that is being quietly handed down from generation to generation of fathers and sons, through the persecuted Treasury of the United States.	这并不是唯一一宗世代相传的诈骗案（姑且这么说——我之前就反复表明，还没有证据证明这是一桩诈骗案），这起案件静静地世代相传，令美国财政部饱受其害。
