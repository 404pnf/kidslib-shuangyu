“Little Speck in Garnered Fruit”	“美中不足”	
by O. Henry	作者：欧·亨利	
The honeymoon was at its full.	那是蜜月中的最美满的时候。	
There was a flat with the reddest of new carpets, tasselled portières and six steins with pewter lids arranged on a ledge above the wainscoting of the dining-room.	房间里铺着红彤彤的新地毯，门上挂着流苏帘子，餐厅护墙板的架子上摆放着六个有白镴盖的啤酒杯。	
The wonder of it was yet upon them.	美妙的感觉依然还在。	
Neither of them had ever seen a yellow primrose by the river’s brim; but if such a sight had met their eyes at that time it would have seemed like—well, whatever the poet expected the right kind of people to see in it besides a primrose.	他们俩谁也没有见过河畔的黄樱草，可即便那个时候黄樱草呈现在他们眼前，那也只是——嗯，除了黄樱草，他们还会看到诗人指望他们从中看到的一切。	
The bride sat in the rocker with her feet resting upon the world.	新娘坐在摇椅上，她的两只脚像是放在整个世界之上。	
She was wrapt in rosy dreams and a kimono of the same hue.	她裹着玫瑰色的睡衣，沉浸在同样颜色的美梦中。	
She wondered what the people in Greenland and Tasmania and Beloochistan were saying one to another about her marriage to Kid McGarry.	她想象着格陵兰、塔斯马尼亚和俾路支斯坦的人会怎样彼此谈论她和小麦加里的婚事。	
Not that it made any difference.	其实那也没多大关系。	
There was no welter-weight from London to the Southern Cross that could stand up four hours—no; four rounds—with her bridegroom.	从伦敦到南十字星，没有哪个重量级拳手能在她的新郎面前坚持四个小时——不，应该说四个回合。	
And he had been hers for three weeks; and the crook of her little finger could sway him more than the fist of any 142-pounder in the world.	三周前他就成了她的人。她的小指头一勾就可以摆布他，比世界上任何一个一百四十二磅级的拳击手的拳头还要好使。	
Love, when it is ours, is the other name for self-abnegation and sacrifice.	当爱情属于我们自己时，它就是克己和牺牲的别称。	
When it belongs to people across the airshaft it means arrogance and self-conceit.	而当它属于对着通风口的邻居时，它就意味着傲慢和自负。	
The bride crossed her oxfords and looked thoughtfully at the distemper Cupids on the ceiling.	新娘交叉着那双穿牛津鞋的脚，若有所思地望着天花板上爱神丘比特的胶画。	
“Precious,” said she, with the air of Cleopatra asking Antony for Rome done up in tissue paper and delivered at residence, “I think I would like a peach.”	“宝贝儿，”她说，神情像是克莱奥帕特拉要求安东尼把罗马用薄纸包好，送到家中那样，“我想要吃桃子。”	译者注：安东尼（83—31BC），罗马后三雄之一，征服埃及后，为埃及女皇克莱奥帕特拉的美色所迷惑。
Kid McGarry arose and put on his coat and hat.	小麦加里站起来，穿好上衣，戴上帽子。	
He was serious, shaven, sentimental, and spry.	他神态诚恳，脸刮得很干净，含情脉脉，充满了生气。	
“All right,” said he, as coolly as though he were only agreeing to sign articles to fight the champion of England.	“好的，”他平静地说道，好像只是在签订同英国拳击冠军比赛的合同，	
“I’ll step down and cop one out for you—see?”	“我出去给你弄一个来——怎么样？”	
“Don’t be long,” said the bride.	“不要太久了，”新娘说，	
“I’ll be lonesome without my naughty boy.	“没有淘气的宝贝儿在，我会孤单的。	
Get a nice, ripe one.”	一定要买个又好又熟的回来呦。”	
After a series of farewells that would have befitted an imminent voyage to foreign parts, the Kid went down to the street.	像是要去国外出远门似的，小伙子经过一连串的道别才走到了街上。	
Here he not unreasonably hesitated, for the season was yet early spring, and there seemed small chance of wresting anywhere from those chill streets and stores the coveted luscious guerdon of summer’s golden prime.	他不无理由地犹豫了片刻，因为现在只是初春时节，要想在那些寒意犹存的街道上和铺子里搞到令人垂涎欲滴而又甘美怡人的盛夏鲜果，似乎并非易事。	
At the Italian’s fruit-stand on the corner he stopped and cast a contemptuous eye over the display of papered oranges, highly polished apples and wan, sun-hungry bananas.	他在街角处意大利人摆的水果摊那里停了下来，不屑地扫了一眼那些用纸包的橘子、抛光的苹果和因缺乏光照而表皮发暗的香蕉。	
“Gotta da peach?” asked the Kid in the tongue of Dante, the lover of lovers.	“有桃子吗？”小麦克用情诗之王但丁的语调问道。	
“Ah, no,—” sighed the vender.	“嗯，没有——”水果摊主叹了口气，	
“Not for one mont com-a da peach.	“一个月之内都不会有。	
Too soon.	还太早。	
Gotta da nice-a orange.	有很不错的橘子，	
Like-a da orange?”	买点儿吗？”	
Scornful, the Kid pursued his quest.	小麦克不以为然，继续他的寻找。	
He entered the all-night chop-house, café, and bowling-alley of his friend and admirer, Justus O’Callahan.	他走进了他的朋友兼崇拜者贾斯特斯·奥卡拉汉经营的通宵餐馆，这也是个咖啡馆，还兼营保龄球场。	
The O’Callahan was about in his institution, looking for leaks.	奥卡拉汉恰巧在店里，照应服务不周全的地方。	
“I want it straight,” said the Kid to him.	“我急着要,”小麦克对他说，	
“The old woman has got a hunch that she wants a peach.	“不知怎的，我老婆想要吃桃子。	
Now, if you’ve got a peach, Cal, get it out quick.	卡尔，如果你现在有的话，就快拿出来吧。	
I want it and others like it if you’ve got ’em in plural quantities.”	一个就行，多的话我也要。”	
“The house is yours,” said O’Callahan.	“这铺子都是你的，”奥卡拉汉说，	
“But there’s no peach in it.	“可就是没有桃子。	
It’s too soon.	现在还不是时候。	
I don’t suppose you could even find ’em at one of the Broadway joints.	恐怕你在整个百老汇大街的所有店里都找不到。	
That’s too bad.	简直糟透了。	
When a lady fixes her mouth for a certain kind of fruit nothing else won’t do.	赶上女人认准了吃什么水果的时候，一点儿辄都没有。	
It’s too late now to find any of the first-class fruiterers open.	现在太晚了，大的水果店都关门了。	
But if you think the missis would like some nice oranges I’ve just got a box of fine ones in that she might—”	如果嫂子愿意吃橘子，我刚进了箱上好的，她也许——”	
“Much obliged, Cal.	“多谢了，卡尔。	
It’s a peach proposition right from the ring of the gong.	从一开始她说的就是桃子。	
I’ll try further.”	我去别的地方试试。	
The time was nearly midnight as the Kid walked down the West-Side avenue.	当小麦克走到西区街上的时候，已将近午夜。	
Few stores were open, and such as were practically hooted at the idea of a peach.	还在营业的店铺寥寥无几，而这几家店铺也都说没有桃子。	
But in her moated flat the bride confidently awaited her Persian fruit.	而在她那城堡似的公寓里，新娘还在信心十足地等着她的波斯水果。	
A champion welter-weight not find a peach?—not stride triumphantly over the seasons and the zodiac and the almanac to fetch an Amsden’s June or a Georgia cling to his owny-own?	难道一个重量级拳击冠军竟找不到一个桃子？——不能胜利地跨越季节、黄道节气和历书，为他的心肝宝贝儿弄到一个阿姆斯登六月或是佐治亚桃吗？	阿姆斯登六月和佐治亚此处均为桃子的品种名称。
The Kid’s eye caught sight of a window that was lighted and gorgeous with nature’s most entrancing colors.	小麦克一眼看到了一个橱窗，里面灯火通明，那是自然界最迷人的色彩。	
The light suddenly went out.		
The Kid sprinted and caught the fruiterer locking his door.	小麦克飞奔过去，正好赶上水果店主在锁门。	
“Peaches?” said he, with extreme deliberation.	“有桃子吗？”他不慌不忙地问道。	
“Well, no, Sir.	“哦，没有，先生。	
Not for three or four weeks yet.	三四个星期之内都不会有的。	
I haven’t any idea where you might find some.	我想不出你在什么地方还能找到。	
There may be a few in town from under the glass, but they’d be hard to locate.	也许城里还有些温室的桃子，不过太难找了。	
Maybe at one of the more expensive hotels—some place where there’s plenty of money to waste.	比较豪华的宾馆——那些根本不在乎花钱的地方也许会有。	
I’ve got some very fine oranges, though—from a shipload that came in to-day.”	不过，我店里有一些很不错的橘子，今天刚从船上卸下来的。”	
The Kid lingered on the corner for a moment, and then set out briskly toward a pair of green lights that flanked the steps of a building down a dark side street.	小麦克在街角上转悠了一会儿，然后快步走向幽暗小巷中的一对绿灯处，那里有一栋房子，灯就在台阶的两侧。	
“Captain around anywhere?” he asked of the desk sergeant of the police station.	“所长在吗？”他问派出所正在执勤的警官。	
At that moment the captain came briskly forward from the rear.	这时，所长正好从后面匆匆走出来。	
He was in plain clothes and had a busy air.	他穿着便衣，显得很忙碌的样子。	
“Hello, Kid,” he said to the pugilist.	“嗨，小伙子，”他对拳击家说，	
“Thought you were bridal-touring?	“你不是度蜜月去了吗？”	
“Got back yesterday.	“昨天回来的。	
I’m a solid citizen now.	我现在是一个良民了。	
Think I’ll take an interest in municipal doings.	我觉得自己对维护城市治安产生了兴趣。	
How would it suit you to get into Denver Dick’s place to-night, Cap?	今晚去抄丹佛·迪克的老窝怎么样，所长？”	
“Past performances,” said the captain, twisting his moustache.	“那是老黄历了，”所长捻着胡子说，	
“Denver was closed up two months ago.”	“两个月前他就关门大吉了。”	
“Correct,” said the Kid.	“不错，”小麦克说。	
“Rafferty chased him out of the Forty-third.	“拉弗蒂把他撵出了四十三街。	
He’s running in your precinct now, and his game’s bigger than ever.	但现在，他在你的地盘儿上干，而且玩得比以前更大。	
I’m down on this gambling business.	我最恨赌博了。	
I can put you against his game.”	我可以带你去端掉他。”	
“In my precinct?” growled the captain.	“在我的地盘上？”所长咆哮道，	
“Are you sure, Kid?	“肯定吗，小麦克？	
I’ll take it as a favor.	你要是能帮忙的话，那真要谢谢你了。	
Have you got the entrée?	你能进去吗？	
How is it to be done?”	怎么进去？”	
“Hammers,” said the Kid.	“用锤子呀，”小麦克说，	
“They haven’t got any steel on the doors yet.	“他们还没给门包上铁皮。	
You’ll need ten men.	你要带十个人。	
No, they won’t let me in the place.	他们不会放我进去的。	
Denver has been trying to do me.	丹佛一直想整我。	
He thought I tipped him off for the other raid.	他以为上次查抄是我告的密。	
I didn’t, though.	其实不是我。	
You want to hurry.	你最好快点儿。	
I’ve got to get back home.	我还要回家呢。	
The house is only three blocks from here.”	他们那儿离这儿只有三个街区远。”	
Before ten minutes had sped the captain with a dozen men stole with their guide into the hallway of a dark and virtuous-looking building in which many businesses were conducted by day.	不出十分钟，所长带了十二个人，跟着他们的向导，偷偷摸进了一座貌似正派的幽暗房子的门厅。白天这里经营着许多生意。	
“Third floor, rear,” said the Kid, softly.	“三楼，后面，”小麦克轻声说，	
“I’ll lead the way.”	“我带路。”	
Two axemen faced the door that he pointed out to them.	两个拿着斧子的人面对着小麦克指着的门。	
“It seems all quiet,” said the captain, doubtfully.	“似乎很安静，”所长狐疑地说，	
“Are you sure your tip is straight?”	“你确定情报准确吗？”	
“Cut away!” said the Kid.	“把门劈开吧！”小麦克说，	
“It’s on me if it ain’t.”	“出错的话我兜着。”	
The axes crashed through the as yet unprotected door.	斧子劈开了那扇还没装防护的门。	
A blaze of light from within poured through the smashed panels.	一束耀眼的光从砸碎的门板中倾泻而出。	
The door fell, and the raiders sprang into the room with their guns handy.	门倒下了，警察们持枪跳进了屋中。	
The big room was furnished with the gaudy magnificence dear to Denver Dick’s western ideas.	那个大屋子按照丹佛·迪克偏爱的西部风格装饰得华丽而俗气。	
Various well-patronized games were in progress.	形形色色的赌博正在进行之中。	
About fifty men who were in the room rushed upon the police in a grand break for personal liberty.	屋子里五十来个人一窝蜂地冲向警察，企图冲破封锁，逃之夭夭。	
The plain-clothes men had to do a little club-swinging.	便衣警察不得不稍稍动用一下警棍。	
More than half the patrons escaped.	大约一半以上的赌客跑掉了。	
Denver Dick had graced his game with his own presence that night.	那晚，丹佛·迪克本人也在，他是来给他的赌场增光添彩的。	
He led the rush that was intended to sweep away the smaller body of raiders, But when he saw the Kid his manner became personal.	他冲在前面，打算从警力较少的地方杀出去。但当他看到小麦克的时候，就变成个人恩怨了。	
Being in the heavyweight class he cast himself joyfully upon his slighter enemy, and they rolled down a flight of stairs in each other’s arms.	重量级的迪克急不可待地扑到体重较轻的仇敌身上，他俩抱在一起滚下了一段楼梯。	
On the landing they separated and arose, and then the Kid was able to use some of his professional tactics, which had been useless to him while in the excited clutch of a 200-pound sporting gentleman who was about to lose $20,000 worth of paraphernalia.	直到楼梯口时，他们才松开彼此，爬了起来。这时候，轮到小麦克施展他的专业技巧了。当那个即将损失两万元财产、体重二百磅的赌徒狠命抓住他的时候，他是无计可施的。	
After vanquishing his adversary the Kid hurried upstairs and through the gambling-room into a smaller apartment connecting by an arched doorway.	打败了对手之后，小麦克急忙跑上楼，从赌场穿过一道拱门，进了一个小房间。	
Here was a long table set with choicest chinaware and silver, and lavishly furnished with food of that expensive and spectacular sort of which the devotees of sport are supposed to be fond.	这里有一张长桌，摆放了大量的精挑细选的瓷器和银器以及颇受赌客们喜爱的昂贵奢华的食物。	
Here again was to be perceived the liberal and florid taste of the gentleman with the urban cognomenal prefix.	那位和大都市同名的先生的随心所欲而又阔绰奢侈的品位在这里又得到了充分体现。	
A No. 10 patent leather shoe protruded a few of its inches outside the tablecloth along the floor.	一双十码的漆皮鞋从垂到地板的桌布底下露出了几寸。	
The Kid seized this and plucked forth a black man in a white tie and the garb of a servitor.	小麦克抓住鞋子，猛地一把拽出一个打着白领带、身穿侍者工作服的黑人。	
“Get up!” commanded the Kid.	“起来！”小麦克命令道，	
“Are you in charge of this free lunch?”	“这顿免费午餐是不是由你负责？”	
“Yes, sah, I was.	“是的，先生，是我。	
Has they done pinched us ag’in, boss?”	是不是他们又逮住我们了，老板？”	
“Looks that way.	“好像是。	
Listen to me.	听我说。	
Are there any peaches in this layout?	这儿有没有桃子？	
If there ain’t I’ll have to throw up the sponge.”	如果没有，我只好认输了。”	
“There was three dozen, sah, when the game opened this evenin’; but I reckon the gentlemen done eat ’em all up.	“今晚开场的时候有三打，先生，但是恐怕让那些先生们吃光了。	
If you’d like to eat a fust-rate orange, sah, I kin find you some.”	如果您想吃上等的橘子，先生，我可以替您找一个。”	
“Get busy,” ordered the Kid, sternly, “and move whatever peach crop you’ve got quick or there’ll be trouble.	“快去拿，”小麦克严厉地吩咐道，“赶快把你这里所有的桃子都拿来，不然就对不起了。	
If anybody oranges me again to-night, I’ll knock his face off.”	今晚谁要是跟我再提橘子，就打掉他的脑袋。”	
The raid on Denver Dick’s high-priced and prodigal luncheon revealed one lone, last peach that had escaped the epicurean jaws of the followers of chance.	查抄了丹佛·迪克的奢华铺张的午餐后，只找到一只孤零零的、逃过那些赌客们贪吃大嘴的桃子。	
Into the Kid’s pocket it went, and that indefatigable forager departed immediately with his prize.	它落进了小麦克的口袋。那位不知疲倦的粮秣征收员立即带上他的奖品离开了。	
With scarcely a glance at the scene on the sidewalk below, where the officers were loading their prisoners into the patrol wagons, he moved homeward with long, swift strides.	人行道上，警察们正把犯人一个个地押上巡逻车，小麦克连看都不看，大步流星地往家里赶。	
His heart was light as he went.	一路上，他的心情轻松愉快。	
So rode the knights back to Camelot after perils and high deeds done for their ladies fair.	骑士们为他们的情人历经危险，建功立业，返回凯米洛特时的心情一定也是这样的。	
The Kid’s lady had commanded him and he had obeyed.	小伙子的情人发出了号令，他服从了。	
True, it was but a peach that she had craved; but it had been no small deed to glean a peach at midnight from that wintry city where yet the February snows lay like iron.	没错，她所盼望的仅仅是只桃子。但是在这样一个春雪封城的寒冷冬季的午夜，想要弄到只桃子也绝非易事。	
She had asked for a peach; she was his bride; in his pocket the peach was warming in his hand that held it for fear that it might fall out and be lost.	她想要一只桃子，她是他的新娘。他的手插在口袋里，紧握着那只渐渐变暖的桃子，生怕它掉出来丢了。	
On the way the Kid turned in at an all-night drug store and said to the spectacled clerk:	半路上，小麦克拐进一家通宵药店，对戴眼镜的店员说：	
“Say, sport, I wish you’d size up this rib of mine and see if it’s broke.	“喂，朋友，麻烦过来查查我这根肋骨有没有断。	
I was in a little scrap and bumped down a flight or two of stairs.”	刚才小打了一架，从一两级楼梯上摔了下来。”	
The druggist made an examination.	药剂师检查了一下。	
“It isn’t broken,” was his diagnosis, “but you have a bruise there that looks like you’d fallen off the Flatiron twice.”	“没有断，”他诊断道，“但你那儿有一道擦伤，看起来像从熨斗大厦上摔下来两次。”	
“That’s all right,” said the Kid.	“没关系，”小麦克说，	
“Let’s have your clothesbrush, please.”	“请把你的衣服刷子借我用用。”	
The bride waited in the rosy glow of the pink lamp shade.	新娘正在粉红灯罩下的玫瑰色光线中等着。	
The miracles were not all passed away.	奇迹还没有全部消失。	
By breathing a desire for some slight thing—a flower, a pomegranate, a—oh, yes, a peach—she could send forth her man into the night, into the world which could not withstand him, and he would do her bidding.	只要悄悄说出对某些小东西的愿望——一朵花、一个石榴、一个——哦，是的，一个桃子——她便可以在深夜中派遣她的男人出去，到被他征服的世界中去，而他将会对她唯命是从。	
And now he stood by her chair and laid the peach in her hand.	现在他就站在她的椅子旁边，把桃子放到了她的手里。	
“Naughty boy!” she said, fondly.	“小淘气！”她娇滴滴地说，	
“Did I say a peach?	“我说的是桃子吗？	
I think I would much rather have had an orange.”	我想我本来是想要橘子的。”	
Blest be the bride.	天佑新娘。
