Four Beasts In One—The Homo-Cameleopard	四不像	
by Edgar Allan Poe	作者：爱伦·坡	
Chacun a ses vertus.	每个人都有优点。	
—Crebillon’s Xerxes.	——克雷比永《薛西斯》	
Antiochus Epihanes is very generally looked upon as the Gog of the prophet Ezekiel.	安条克·伊皮法尼斯被普遍认为是先知以西结所预言的歌革。	译者注：歌革在先知的预言中是人类反抗基督的领袖。
This honor is, however, more properly attributable to Cambyses, the son of Cyrus.	然而，这一荣耀更适合归功于居鲁士大帝之子冈比西斯。	
And, indeed, the character of the Syrian monarch does by no means stand in need of any adventitious embellishment.	事实上，这位叙利亚王的威望根本无需任何外在的点缀。	
His accession to the throne, or rather his usurpation of the sovereignty, a hundred and seventy-one years before the coming of Christ; his attempt to plunder the temple of Diana at Ephesus; his implacable hostility to the Jews; his pollution of the Holy of Holies; and his miserable death at Taba, after a tumultuous reign of eleven years, are circumstances of a prominent kind, and therefore more generally noticed by the historians of his time than the impious, dastardly, cruel, silly, and whimsical achievements which make up the sum total of his private life and reputation.	他在基督降世前171年继承王位，确切地说，是篡夺王权；他欲洗劫以弗所的狄安娜神庙的意图、他同犹太人势不两立的敌意、他对圣殿至圣所的亵渎以及他在动荡不安的11年统治后于塔巴的凄惨离世，这些都是令其名声大噪之事，他也因此备受同时代的历史学家们的关注，相比之下，构成他私生活和名声之和的那些邪恶的、卑鄙的、残酷的、愚蠢的以及荒唐的成就便被置之一旁了。	
Let us suppose, gentle reader, that it is now the year of the world three thousand eight hundred and thirty, and let us, for a few minutes, imagine ourselves at that most grotesque habitation of man, the remarkable city of Antioch.	亲爱的读者，让我们假设现在是3830年前的世界，并暂且一起想象，此时此刻我们正置身于那最奇特的人类居住地——大名鼎鼎的安条克城。	
To be sure there were, in Syria and other countries, sixteen cities of that appellation, besides the one to which I more particularly allude.	的确，除了我特别提及的这座城，在叙利亚和其他国家还有十六个城市也叫这个名字。	
But ours is that which went by the name of Antiochia Epidaphne, from its vicinity to the little village of Daphne, where stood a temple to that divinity.	但我们的这座城被唤作安条克·伊皮达夫尼，因它邻近达夫妮小村，那里耸立着一座崇奉那位达夫妮女神的庙宇。	
It was built (although about this matter there is some dispute) by Seleucus Nicanor, the first king of the country after Alexander the Great, in memory of his father Antiochus, and became immediately the residence of the Syrian monarchy.	安条克城是由亚历山大大帝的第一任继业者塞琉古·尼卡诺尔为纪念其父安条克所建（尽管此说尚有争议），并立刻成为了叙利亚塞琉古帝国的都城。	
In the flourishing times of the Roman Empire, it was the ordinary station of the prefect of the eastern provinces; and many of the emperors of the queen city (among whom may be mentioned, especially, Verus and Valens) spent here the greater part of their time.	在罗马帝国强盛时期，这里是东部行省行政长官的常驻地。此外，许多罗马皇帝（其中特别值得一提的是维鲁斯和瓦伦斯）在这里度过了他们的大部分人生。	
But I perceive we have arrived at the city itself.	但现在我感觉我们已经到了这座城市。	
Let us ascend this battlement, and throw our eyes upon the town and neighboring country.	就让我们登上城垛，将目光投向城镇和周边的乡村。	
“What broad and rapid river is that which forces its way, with innumerable falls, through the mountainous wilderness, and finally through the wilderness of buildings?”	“那条河流江宽水急，携着无数瀑布，奔流过荒山野岭最后又淌过一大片荒芜的建筑群，那是什么河？”	
That is the Orontes, and it is the only water in sight, with the exception of the Mediterranean, which stretches, like a broad mirror, about twelve miles off to the southward.	那是奥龙特斯河，除了在南边十二英里外绵延的、宛如一大面明镜的地中海，它是视野内唯一能见到的水域。	
Every one has seen the Mediterranean; but let me tell you, there are few who have had a peep at Antioch.	人人都已见过地中海，但我告诉你，很少有人偷瞄过安条克城。	
By few, I mean, few who, like you and me, have had, at the same time, the advantages of a modern education.	我指的很少人是像你我一样，既受过现代教育又在这城市参观的人。	
Therefore cease to regard that sea, and give your whole attention to the mass of houses that lie beneath us.	所以，别再盯着地中海了，全神贯注于我们脚下这片连甍接栋的房屋吧。	
You will remember that it is now the year of the world three thousand eight hundred and thirty.	你会铭记现在是三千八百三十年前的世界。	
Were it later—for example, were it the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and forty-five, we should be deprived of this extraordinary spectacle.	若年代再近一点儿——比如，现在是公元1845年，我们应该见不到这样非凡的奇观。	
In the nineteenth century Antioch is—that is to say, Antioch will be—in a lamentable state of decay.	在19世纪，安条克城已是——说得更准确点儿，安条克将是——一片令人惋惜的衰败景象。	
It will have been, by that time, totally destroyed, at three different periods, by three successive earthquakes.	到那时候，这座城市已经历过三个不同的时代，并被接连而至的三场地震彻底摧毁。	
Indeed, to say the truth, what little of its former self may then remain, will be found in so desolate and ruinous a state that the patriarch shall have removed his residence to Damascus.	说实话，那时它应该大不如从前，留下的将是满目疮痍，一片废墟，以至于国王也将都城迁到了大马士革。	
This is well.	这很好。	
I see you profit by my advice, and are making the most of your time in inspecting the premises—in	我知道你得益于我的建议，正用你大部分的时间观察我刚提到的这些房屋——	
-satisfying your eyes	瞧瞧这里	
With the memorials and the things of fame	令这座城市大名鼎鼎的名胜古迹	
That most renown this city.—	一饱眼福吧——	
I beg pardon; I had forgotten that Shakespeare will not flourish for seventeen hundred and fifty years to come.	请原谅，我刚刚忘记了1750年后莎士比亚才负有盛名。	
But does not the appearance of Epidaphne justify me in calling it grotesque?	不过伊比达夫尼的城市风光不正可以说明我称之奇观是正确的吗？	
“It is well fortified; and in this respect is as much indebted to nature as to art.”	“这儿壁垒森严，而这一点既要归功于人工也要感激自然。”	
Very true.	非常正确。	
“There are a prodigious number of stately palaces.”	“这里有无数富丽堂皇的宫殿。”	
There are.	是的。	
“And the numerous temples, sumptuous and magnificent, may bear comparison with the most lauded of antiquity.”	“还有那些数不清的神庙，华丽且宏伟，一点儿也不亚于最广受称赞的古迹。”	
All this I must acknowledge.	这一切我必须承认。	
Still there is an infinity of mud huts, and abominable hovels.	但那里还有无穷无尽的泥棚屋和令人生厌的茅舍。	
We cannot help perceiving abundance of filth in every kennel, and, were it not for the over-powering fumes of idolatrous incense, I have no doubt we should find a most intolerable stench.	我们不禁会联想到每一间陋室里的污秽肮脏，而且，若不是那敬神香火的浓烈烟气，我深信我们会闻到一股最无法忍受的恶臭。	
Did you ever behold streets so insufferably narrow, or houses so miraculously tall?	你曾见过狭窄得令人如此难以忍受的街道，或是高耸得令人出乎意料的房屋吗？	
What gloom their shadows cast upon the ground!	它们掷在地上的影子是多么阴暗！	
It is well the swinging lamps in those endless colonnades are kept burning throughout the day; we should otherwise have the darkness of Egypt in the time of her desolation.	幸好那些望不到头的柱廊里的吊灯整天都亮着，否则埃及荒凉时代的黑暗之灾就该临到我们了。	
“It is certainly a strange place!	“这的确是个怪地方！	
What is the meaning of yonder singular building?	那边那个奇特的建筑是做什么用的？	
See! it towers above all others, and lies to the eastward of what I take to be the royal palace.”	看！它比其他建筑都高，就在我认为是皇宫的建筑的东边。”	
That is the new Temple of the Sun, who is adored in Syria under the title of Elah Gabalah.	那是新的太阳神庙，太阳神在叙利亚广受崇拜并被称为埃拉·加巴卢斯。	
Hereafter a very notorious Roman Emperor will institute this worship in Rome, and thence derive a cognomen, Heliogabalus.	今后将有一位非常臭名昭著的罗马皇帝在罗马开创这种崇拜，并由此派生出一个姓氏——赫利奥加巴卢斯。	
I dare say you would like to take a peep at the divinity of the temple.	我敢说你想瞧瞧那神庙里的神。	
You need not look up at the heavens; his Sunship is not there—at least not the Sunship adored by the Syrians.	你不必往天上看；他的光辉不在那里——至少不是叙利亚人所崇拜的光辉。	
That deity will be found in the interior of yonder building.	在那边的建筑里就能感受到那种神性。	
He is worshipped under the figure of a large stone pillar terminating at the summit in a cone or pyramid, whereby is denoted Fire.	受膜拜的神像是一根巨大石柱，顶端为圆锥形或金字塔形，借此来象征火。	
“Hark—behold!—who can those ridiculous beings be, half naked, with their faces painted, shouting and gesticulating to the rabble?”	“听——快看！——那些可笑的家伙，那些半裸着身体、脸上涂着油彩、对着贱民们手舞足蹈大呼小叫的家伙是谁？”	
Some few are mountebanks.	他们中少数人是耍把戏的。	
Others more particularly belong to the race of philosophers.	其他一部分人具体地说应属于哲学家界。	
The greatest portion, however—those especially who belabor the populace with clubs—are the principal courtiers of the palace, executing as in duty bound, some laudable comicality of the king’s.	而绝大多数——尤其是那些挥舞棍棒痛打群氓的人——是正在执行国王命令的宫中重臣，这些命令真是值得赞赏的滑稽行为。	
“But what have we here?	“但我们听到的是什么？	
Heavens! the town is swarming with wild beasts!	天哪！这城里尽是野兽！	
How terrible a spectacle!—how dangerous a peculiarity!”	多可怕的奇观！——多危险的怪景！”	
Terrible, if you please; but not in the least degree dangerous.	你也许觉得糟糕透顶，但这一点儿也不危险。	
Each animal if you will take the pains to observe, is following, very quietly, in the wake of its master.	若你不怕费心就仔细看看，每头野兽都安静地紧跟在它主人后面。	
Some few, to be sure, are led with a rope about the neck, but these are chiefly the lesser or timid species.	当然，有少部分野兽是脖颈上套着绳子被主人牵着，但这些主要都是个头矮小胆子也不大的种类。	
The lion, the tiger, and the leopard are entirely without restraint.	狮子、老虎和豹子完全无拘无束。	
They have been trained without difficulty to their present profession, and attend upon their respective owners in the capacity of valets-de-chambre.	它们毫不费力地就被驯化来从事它们目前的职业，并服侍尊敬的主人，充当他们的贴身跟班。	
It is true, there are occasions when Nature asserts her violated dominions;—but then the devouring of a man-at-arms, or the throttling of a consecrated bull, is a circumstance of too little moment to be more than hinted at in Epidaphne.	的确，也有大自然维护自己被侵犯的主权的时候；——但在伊比达夫尼城，吞噬一个士兵，或勒死一只祭祀用的公牛，就是一眨眼的工夫，根本不足挂齿。	
“But what extraordinary tumult do I hear?	“但我听到的是什么非同寻常的喧哗？	
Surely this is a loud noise even for Antioch!	这声音对安条克城来说无疑也是巨大的噪音！	
It argues some commotion of unusual interest.”	这说明肯定发生了重大暴动。”	
Yes—undoubtedly.	是的——毋庸置疑。	
The king has ordered some novel spectacle—some gladiatorial exhibition at the hippodrome—or perhaps the massacre of the Scythian prisoners—or the conflagration of his new palace—or the tearing down of a handsome temple—or, indeed, a bonfire of a few Jews.	国王已经下令开发某个新景点——竞技场的角斗士表演——或是屠杀西徐亚囚犯——也许是大火焚烧他的新宫殿——抑或是拆毁一座雄伟的神庙——或者，甚至是烧死一些犹太人。	
The uproar increases.	骚动升级了。	
Shouts of laughter ascend the skies.	欢笑的呐喊声响彻云际。	
The air becomes dissonant with wind instruments, and horrible with clamor of a million throats.	管乐器的声音在空气中显得格格不入，数百万民众的喧闹声令人生厌。	
Let us descend, for the love of fun, and see what is going on!	我们去找点儿乐子吧，下去看看发生了什么事！	
This way—be careful!	这边走——小心点儿！	
Here we are in the principal street, which is called the street of Timarchus.	我们目前所在的就是主街道，名叫提马克斯街。	
The sea of people is coming this way, and we shall find a difficulty in stemming the tide.	人潮往这边涌来了，我们将很难在人流中逆行。	
They are pouring through the alley of Heraclides, which leads directly from the palace;—therefore the king is most probably among the rioters.	他们正奔涌过赫拉克利德斯小巷，这条小巷能直通皇宫；——所以国王极有可能就在这群骚乱者中。	
Yes;—I hear the shouts of the herald proclaiming his approach in the pompous phraseology of the East.	果然；——我听见皇宫信使用带有东方特色的浮夸措词高声宣布国王的驾临。	
We shall have a glimpse of his person as he passes by the temple of Ashimah.	当他经过亚示玛神庙时我们就可以瞥见他的风采了。	
Let us ensconce ourselves in the vestibule of the sanctuary; he will be here anon.	我们就安坐在神庙门口，他马上就会过来。	
In the meantime let us survey this image.	在此期间我们来仔细瞧瞧这尊神像。	
What is it?	这是谁？	
Oh! it is the god Ashimah in proper person.	噢！这正是亚示玛神。	
You perceive, however, that he is neither a lamb, nor a goat, nor a satyr, neither has he much resemblance to the Pan of the Arcadians.	可是你看，他既不是羔羊，也不是山羊，不像萨特，也不大像阿卡迪亚的潘神。	
Yet all these appearances have been given—I beg pardon—will be given—by the learned of future ages, to the Ashimah of the Syrians.	然而所有这些外貌都被——不好意思——将被——未来的学者赋予叙利亚人的亚示玛神。	
Put on your spectacles, and tell me what it is.	带上你的眼镜，并告诉我这是什么。	
What is it?	是什么？	
“Bless me! it is an ape!”	“天哪！是一只猿！”	
True—a baboon; but by no means the less a deity.	不错——是一只狒狒，但这绝没有减少一丝神性。	
His name is a derivation of the Greek Simia—what great fools are antiquarians!	他的名字是希腊字类人猿的派生词——古生物研究者都是些愚蠢的大笨蛋！	
But see!—see!—yonder scampers a ragged little urchin.	可你看！——快看！——那里有个衣衫褴褛的小毛孩在蹦蹦跳跳。	
Where is he going?	他要去哪里？	
What is he bawling about?	他叫喊着什么？	
What does he say?	他在说什么？	
Oh! he says the king is coming in triumph; that he is dressed in state; that he has just finished putting to death, with his own hand, a thousand chained Israelitish prisoners!	噢！他说国王正凯旋而归；他盛装打扮；他刚刚用他自己的双手杀死了一千名镣铐加身的以色列俘虏！	
For this exploit the ragamuffin is lauding him to the skies.	这个小毛孩就因这一壮举把他捧上了天。	
Hark! here comes a troop of a similar description.	听！来了一队由同一类人组成的整齐队伍。	
They have made a Latin hymn upon the valor of the king, and are singing it as they go:	他们创作了一曲拉丁赞歌来颂扬国王的英勇，并边走边唱：	
Mille, mille, mille,	Mille, mille, mille,	
Mille, mille, mille,	Mille, mille, mille,	
Decollavimus, unus homo!	Decollaviums, unus homo!	
Mille, mille, mille, mille, decollavimus!	Mille, mille, mille, mille, decollaviums!	
Mille, mille, mille,	Mille, mille, mille, 	
Vivat qui mille mille occidit!	Vivat qui mille mille occidit!	
Tantum vini habet nemo	Tantum vini habet nemo	
Quantum sanguinis effudit![1]	Quantum sanguinis effudit![1]	
Which may be thus paraphrased:	这首歌可以这样翻译：	
A thousand, a thousand, a thousand,	一千，一千，一千，	
A thousand, a thousand, a thousand,	一千，一千，一千，	
We, with one warrior, have slain!	仅剩一个，我们就要将敌人全灭！	
A thousand, a thousand, a thousand, a thousand.	一千，一千，一千，一千。	
Sing a thousand over again!	反复高唱千遍！	
Soho!—let us sing	嘿！——让我们一起高歌	
Long life to our king,	我们的国王万岁万岁万万岁，	
Who knocked over a thousand so fine!	他打倒了一千个敌人是如此了得！	
Soho!—let us roar,	嘿！——让我们一起高呼，	
He has given us more	他赐予我们	
Red gallons of gore	无数加仑的红色血水	
Than all Syria can furnish of wine!	比叙利亚能供应的酒水还要多上万千！	
“Do you hear that flourish of trumpets?”	“你听到大肆鼓吹的号笛声了吗？”	
Yes: the king is coming!	是的：国王来了！	
See! the people are aghast with admiration, and lift up their eyes to the heavens in reverence.	快瞧！人们崇拜得都惊呆了，怀着敬畏之心举目望向天空。	
He comes;—he is coming;—there he is!	他来了；——他正朝这边走来；——他就在那里！	
“Who?—where?—the king?—do not behold him—cannot say that I perceive him.”	“谁？——在哪里？——国王吗？——我看不见他——我怎么没看见他。”	
Then you must be blind.	那你一定是瞎了眼。	
“Very possible.	“极有可能。	
Still I see nothing but a tumultuous mob of idiots and madmen, who are busy in prostrating themselves before a gigantic cameleopard, and endeavoring to obtain a kiss of the animal’s hoofs.	可我仍然只看见一大群聒噪的白痴和疯子，他们正忙着跪拜在一个巨大的长颈鹿跟前，拼命想在那个野兽的蹄子上献吻。	
See! the beast has very justly kicked one of the rabble over—and another—and another—and another.	看！那家伙还理所当然地挨个儿踢那些贱民——又一个——另一个——再一个。	
Indeed, I cannot help admiring the animal for the excellent use he is making of his feet.”	实话说来，我都忍不住感叹那野兽对自己蹄子的出色利用。”	
Rabble, indeed!—why these are the noble and free citizens of Epidaphne!	贱民，真的吗！——为什么偏偏他们就是高贵而自由的伊比达夫尼城的公民！	
Beasts, did you say?—take care that you are not overheard.	野兽们，怎么可能？——小心别被人听见。	
Do you not perceive that the animal has the visage of a man?	你没看见这动物有张人面吗？	
Why, my dear sir, that cameleopard is no other than Antiochus Epiphanes, Antiochus the Illustrious, King of Syria, and the most potent of all the autocrats of the East!	哎呀，我亲爱的朋友，那个长颈鹿就是安条克家族中的名人、叙利亚塞琉古王朝的国王、东方独裁者中最强势的安条克·伊皮法尼斯呀！	
It is true, that he is entitled, at times, Antiochus Epimanes—Antiochus the madman—but that is because all people have not the capacity to appreciate his merits.	的确，有时他也被称为安条克·伊皮蛮尼斯——疯子安条克——但那是因为还没有人有资格来评价他的功绩。	
It is also certain that he is at present ensconced in the hide of a beast, and is doing his best to play the part of a cameleopard; but this is done for the better sustaining his dignity as king.	毫无疑问，他现在正藏身于一张兽皮之下，且在竭力扮演好一只长颈鹿的角色；但这样做是为了更好地维护他作为国王的尊严。	
Besides, the monarch is of gigantic stature, and the dress is therefore neither unbecoming nor over large.	而且，国王身材魁梧，这身装束对他来说既不会太小也不会过大。	
We may, however, presume he would not have adopted it but for some occasion of especial state.	然而我们可以推测出他只会在某些特殊场合才会穿它。	
Such, you will allow, is the massacre of a thousand Jews.	你也会认同，现在就是一个屠杀了千名犹太人的特殊场合。	
With how superior a dignity the monarch perambulates on all fours!	国王如此匍匐巡行是多么威严高贵！	
His tail, you perceive, is held aloft by his two principal concubines, Elline and Argelais; and his whole appearance would be infinitely prepossessing, were it not for the protuberance of his eyes, which will certainly start out of his head, and the queer color of his face, which has become nondescript from the quantity of wine he has swallowed.	你看，他的尾巴被他的两位爱妾——艾琳娜和阿吉莱斯高举着。若不是那双快从脑袋上蹦出来的突起的青蛙眼和他脸上那因为饮酒过多而露出的不可言状的怪异色彩，他的整个打扮倒还挺讨人喜欢。	
Let us follow him to the hippodrome, whither he is proceeding, and listen to the song of triumph which he is commencing:	让我们尾随他去他正要前往的竞技场吧，也听听他正开唱的胜利之歌：	
Who is king but Epiphanes?	除了伊皮法尼斯谁能称王？	
Say—do you know?	说吧——你可知晓？	
Who is king but Epiphanes?	除了伊皮法尼斯谁能称王？	
Bravo!—bravo!	好极了！——棒极了！	
There is none but Epiphanes,	唯我伊皮法尼斯，	
No—there is none:	无人——再无人：	
So tear down the temples,	能如此拆毁这些神庙，	
And put out the sun!	熄灭那轮骄阳！	
Well and strenuously sung!	多么动听且激情的歌唱！	
The populace are hailing him ‘Prince of Poets,’ as well as ‘Glory of the East,’ ‘Delight of the Universe,’ and ‘Most Remarkable of Cameleopards.’	人群爆发出欢呼声，不仅称他为“东方之光”、“宇宙之福”和“最杰出的长颈鹿”，还尊他为“诗坛巨头”。	
 They have encored his effusion, and do you hear?—he is singing it over again.	他们要求他再演唱一次，你听见了吗？——他又在唱那首歌了。	
When he arrives at the hippodrome, he will be crowned with the poetic wreath, in anticipation of his victory at the approaching Olympics.	当他到达竞技场时，他将被戴上诗人名号的花冠，以期待他在即将到来的奥林匹克竞赛上的胜利。	
“But, good Jupiter! what is the matter in the crowd behind us?”	“但是，噢，天哪！我们身后这人群是怎么回事？”	
Behind us, did you say?—oh! ah!—I perceive.	你刚刚说，在我们身后吗？——哦！啊！——我注意到了。	
My friend, it is well that you spoke in time.	我的朋友，还好你说的正是时候。	
Let us get into a place of safety as soon as possible.	让我们尽快去个安全的地方。	
Here!—let us conceal ourselves in the arch of this aqueduct, and I will inform you presently of the origin of the commotion.	就是这里啦！——让我们藏到渡槽的拱形门下面去，我一会儿就告诉你这场骚乱的起因。	
It has turned out as I have been anticipating.	它和我一直以来所预想的一样。	
The singular appearance of the cameleopard and the head of a man, has, it seems, given offence to the notions of propriety entertained, in general, by the wild animals domesticated in the city.	看起来，是这长着人头的长颈鹿的怪异外表触犯了这座城市中驯养的野兽们一般能接受的礼节观念。	
A mutiny has been the result; and, as is usual upon such occasions, all human efforts will be of no avail in quelling the mob.	暴动就是其造成的结果。然而，通常在这种情况下，人为力量对镇压暴徒根本无济于事。	
Several of the Syrians have already been devoured; but the general voice of the four-footed patriots seems to be for eating up the cameleopard.	好几个叙利亚人已经被吞掉了，可那些四条腿的爱国者们的普遍呼声似乎是要把这头长颈鹿吃个精光。	
‘The Prince of Poets,’ therefore, is upon his hinder legs, running for his life.	因此，“诗坛巨头”站立起来，正用后腿逃命。	
His courtiers have left him in the lurch, and his concubines have followed so excellent an example.	他的大臣们都弃他于危难之中，他的爱妾们也都纷纷追随大臣们树立的好榜样。	
‘Delight of the Universe,’ thou art in a sad predicament!	“宇宙之福”，你陷入了悲哀的窘境啊！	
‘Glory of the East,’ thou art in danger of mastication!	“东方之光”，你面临着被撕碎的危险！	
Therefore never regard so piteously thy tail; it will undoubtedly be draggled in the mud, and for this there is no help.	所以，绝对不要可怜巴巴地关心你那尾巴，它肯定会在泥垢里拖脏，但这也无可奈何。	
Look not behind thee, then, at its unavoidable degradation; but take courage, ply thy legs with vigor, and scud for the hippodrome!	那么，就不要回头看它那不可避免的落魄，而是鼓起勇气，奋力摆动双腿，全力飞奔向竞技场！	
Remember that thou art Antiochus Epiphanes.	记住你是安条克·伊皮法尼斯。	
Antiochus the Illustrious!—also ‘Prince of Poets,’ ‘Glory of the East,’ ‘Delight of the Universe,’ and ‘Most Remarkable of Cameleopards!’	杰出的安条克！——也是“诗坛巨头”、“东方之光”、“宇宙之福”和“最杰出的长颈鹿”！	
 Heavens! what a power of speed thou art displaying!	天哪！你所展示的速度能力是多么强大！	
What a capacity for leg-bail thou art developing!	你所显露的逃跑能力又是多么惊人！	
Run, Prince!—Bravo, Epiphanes!	跑呀，巨头！——棒极了，伊皮法尼斯！	
Well done, Cameleopard!—Glorious Antiochus!—He runs!—he leaps!—he flies!	做得好，长颈鹿！——享誉盛名的安条克！——他跑！——他跳！——他飞！	
Like an arrow from a catapult he approaches the hippodrome!	他如离弦之箭一般冲到了竞技场！	
He leaps!—he shrieks!—he is there!	他飞跃！——他尖叫！——他到了！	
This is well; for hadst thou, ‘Glory of the East,’ been half a second longer in reaching the gates of the Amphitheatre, there is not a bear’s cub in Epidaphne that would not have had a nibble at thy carcase.	可是，“东方之光”，你若是到达竞技场大门时迟了半秒，伊皮达夫尼城的每一只幼熊都将细细啃咬你的尸体。	
Let us be off—let us take our departure!—for we shall find our delicate modern ears unable to endure the vast uproar which is about to commence in celebration of the king’s escape!	我们该离开了——我们出发吧！——因为我们将会发现，我们那脆弱的现代化耳朵将无法忍受即将开始的庆祝国王逃脱的巨大欢呼声。	
Listen! it has already commenced.	听哪！那声音已经开始了。	
See!—the whole town is topsy-turvy.	看哪！——整座城市都乱七八糟。	
“Surely this is the most populous city of the East!	“这无疑是东方人口最多的城市！	
What a wilderness of people! what a jumble of all ranks and ages! what a multiplicity of sects and nations! what a variety of costumes! what a Babel of languages! what a screaming of beasts! what a tinkling of instruments! what a parcel of philosophers!”	多么浩瀚的茫茫人海！男女老少和社会各阶级的人都乱成一团！如此多样的教派和种族！五花八门的衣装打扮！混乱繁杂的南腔北调！尖锐刺耳的野兽嘶吼！叮当作响的乐器声！还有一群扎堆的哲学家！	
Come let us be off.	来吧，我们走吧。	
“Stay a moment!	“等一会儿！	
I see a vast hubbub in the hippodrome; what is the meaning of it, I beseech you?”	我看见竞技场内一阵大骚动；请你告诉我，究竟发生了什么事？”	
That?—oh, nothing!	那阵骚动？——哦，没什么！	
The noble and free citizens of Epidaphne being, as they declare, well satisfied of the faith, valor, wisdom, and divinity of their king, and having, moreover, been eye-witnesses of his late superhuman agility, do think it no more than their duty to invest his brows (in addition to the poetic crown) with the wreath of victory in the footrace—a wreath which it is evident he must obtain at the celebration of the next Olympiad, and which, therefore, they now give him in advance.	就如伊皮达夫尼城那高贵自由的公民们所宣布的一样，他们对他们国王的忠诚、勇猛、智慧和神威一直深信不疑。此外，他们又刚亲眼见证他宛如超人般的敏捷身手，认为他们的职责就是授予他（除诗人桂冠之外）赛跑比赛的胜利花环——一个显然在下届奥林匹克竞赛的庆典上他会获得的花环，现在他们提前颁给了他。	
[1]Flavius Vospicus says, that the hymn here introduced was sung by the rabble upon the occasion of Aurelian, in the Sarmatic war, having slain, with his own hand, nine hundred and fifty of the enemy.	［1］弗拉维奥·沃斯皮库斯说，这首赞歌是在萨尔马提亚战争中奥勒良亲手杀死了九百五十名敌人后由贱民们所唱。
