The Four Gifts	四份特别的礼物
by Andrew Lang	作者：安德鲁·朗格
In the old land of Brittany, once called Cornwall, there lived a woman named Barbaik Bourhis, who spent all her days in looking after her farm with the help of her niece Tephany.	在布列塔尼这片曾被叫做康沃尔的古老土地上，住着一位名叫巴贝尔·布里的妇女。她把所有的时间和精力都放在照看农场上。侄女泰法妮一直在她那里帮忙。
Early and late the two might be seen in the fields or in the dairy, milking cows, making butter, feeding fowls; working hard themselves and taking care that others worked too.	她们俩一天到晚不是在田地里就是在牛奶房里，挤牛奶、制黄油、喂家禽……她俩自己没日没夜地干活，也时刻监督着身边的人努力干活。
Perhaps it might have been better for Barbaik if she had left herself a little time to rest and to think about other things, for soon she grew to love money for its own sake, and only gave herself and Tephany the food and clothes they absolutely needed.	如果巴尔贝还有点儿时间来休息或者想点儿其他事情的话，情况可能会稍好些，可她并没有。这样一来，没过多久，她就深深地爱上了钱这个东西，而且她只舍得把钱花在她和泰法妮的生活必需品上，例如食物和衣服。
And as for poor people she positively hated them, and declared that such lazy creatures had no business in the world.	正因为巴尔贝迷恋金钱，致使她极度厌恶那些穷人，甚至还常说这样懒惰的家伙活在世上毫无用处。
Well, this being the sort of person Barbaik was, it is easy to guess at her anger when one day she found Tephany talking outside the cowhouse to young Denis, who was nothing more than a day labourer from the village of Plover.	巴尔贝其实就是这样的人。因此，我们可以轻易地想象出，当她发现泰法妮居然在牛舍外和那个一无所有的穷鬼丹尼斯聊天时，她是多么怒不可遏。要知道，那个丹尼斯不过是养鸟场雇的一个日工而已。
Seizing her niece by the arm, she pulled her sharply away, exclaiming:	巴尔贝一把抓住了侄女的胳膊，猛地把她拽走，嘴里还大声叫嚷着：
‘Are you not ashamed, girl, to waste your time over a man who is as poor as a rat, when there are a dozen more who would be only too happy to buy you rings of silver, if you would let them?’	“你把时间浪费在这种人身上，难道不觉得羞耻吗？他是个一无所有的穷鬼。而你呢，有一打的人排着队要给你买银戒指，要是你愿意的话，他们高兴还来不及。”
‘Denis is a good workman, as you know very well,’ answered Tephany, red with anger, ‘and he puts by money too, and soon he will be able to take a farm for himself.’	“你也知道的，丹尼斯工作很卖力，”泰法妮反驳道，气得满脸通红，“他正在攒钱，再过不久就能自己开个农场了。”
‘Nonsense,’ cried Barbaik, ‘he will never save enough for a farm till he is a hundred.	“鬼话连篇！”巴尔贝叫道，“他开农场，等到一百岁吧。
I would sooner see you in your grave than the wife of a man who carries his whole fortune on his back.’	像他这种穷得掉渣的人，你还没成为他老婆，他就先去坟墓里了。”
‘What does fortune matter when one is young and strong?’ asked Tephany, but her aunt, amazed at such words, would hardly let her finish.	“当一个人年轻力壮的时候，有没有钱又有什么关系？”泰法妮反问道。但是姑妈对她的这番话愤怒不已，岂能容许她说完！
‘What does fortune matter?’ repeated Barbaik, in a shocked voice.	“有没有钱又有什么关系？”巴尔贝震惊地重复道，怎么也不敢相信泰法妮居然说出这种话来，
‘Is it possible that you are really so foolish as to despise money?	“你怎么会真的蠢到瞧不起钱？
If this is what you learn from Denis, I forbid you to speak to him, and I will have him turned out of the farm if he dares to show his face here again.	如果真是丹尼斯把你教坏的，你以后不准和他说半句话。他要是再胆敢来见你，我立马把他赶出农场。
Now go and wash the clothes and spread them out to dry.’	先给我去把衣服洗好晾干。”
Tephany did not dare to disobey, but with a heavy heart went down the path to the river.	泰法妮压根儿不敢违抗姑妈的命令，只得朝小溪边走去，但内心无比沉重，心烦意乱。
‘She is harder than these rocks,’ said the girl to herself, ‘yes, a thousand times harder.	“她简直比这些石头还顽固，”泰法妮自言自语着，“是的，比石头还要顽固一千倍。
For the rain at least can at last wear away the stone, but you might cry for ever, and she would never care.	至少滴水最后可以穿石，但是她呢，不管我如何哭泣如何央求，她都毫不理睬，更别说让她改变主意了。
Talking to Denis is the only pleasure I have, and if I am not to see him I may as well enter a convent.’	如今，和丹尼斯聊天已经是我唯一的乐趣了，倘若再也不能见他，这和让我去修道院有什么区别？”
Thinking these thoughts she reached the bank, and began to unfold the large packet of linen that had to be washed.	她边想着边来到了岸边，正准备打开那个大亚麻布袋，里面装满了要洗的衣服。
The tap of a stick made her look up, and standing before her she saw a little old woman, whose face was strange to her.	就在这时，她听到了一阵“咚咚咚”的棍子敲地声。抬头一看，她面前站着一位自己并不认识的瘦小老妇。
‘You would like to sit down and rest, granny?’ asked Tephany, pushing aside her bundle.	“老奶奶，您要坐下来休息一下吗？”泰法妮问道，把自己的布袋推到了旁边，给老人留出了位置。
‘When the sky is all the roof you have, you rest where you will,’ replied the old woman in trembling tones.	“当一个人以天为被，以地为席时，不管在哪里都是可以休息的。”老妇人颤声答道。
‘Are you so lonely, then?’ inquired Tephany, full of pity.	“您这样难道不孤单吗？”泰法妮满是同情，
‘Have you no friends who would welcome you into their houses?’	“您朋友都不愿意收留您？”
The old woman shook her head.	老妇人摇了摇头。
‘They all died long, long ago,’ she answered, ‘and the only friends I have are strangers with kind hearts.’	“他们很久很久以前就死了，”她接着说，“现在我唯一的朋友就是那些善良的陌生人。”
The girl did not speak for a moment, then held out the small loaf and some bacon intended for her dinner.	泰法妮沉默了一会儿，然后拿出了她本留作晚饭的小面包和培根。
‘Take this,’ she said; ‘to-day at any rate you shall dine well,’ and the old woman took it, gazing at Tephany the while.	“这些拿去吃吧，”泰法妮对老妇说，“今天你无论如何都得好好吃一顿。”老妇人接过食物，一直看着泰法妮。
‘Those who help others deserve to be helped,’ she answered; ‘your eyes are still red because that miser Barbaik has forbidden you to speak to the young man from Plover.	“那些帮助别人的人也该得到别人的帮助，”老妇说着，“你眼睛还红红的，因为那个守财奴巴尔贝不让你和养鸟场的那位年轻人说话。
But cheer up, you are a good girl, and I will give you something that will enable you to see him once every day.’	但是振作起来，你是个好女孩，我会给你一样东西，可以让你每天都能见他一次。”
‘You?’ cried Tephany, stupefied at discovering that the beggar knew all about her affairs, but the old woman did not hear her.	“你？”泰法妮喊道，她很震惊面前这个老妇怎么会知道她这么多事情。老妇并没听到她的嘀咕。
‘Take this long copper pin,’ she went on, ‘and every time you stick it in your dress Mother Bourhis will be obliged to leave the house in order to go and count her cabbages.	“拿着这个长铜片，”她接着说，“你只要把它贴在衣服上，巴尔贝就会被赶到屋子外面去数她的卷心菜。
As long as the pin is in your dress you will be free, and your aunt will not come back until you have put it in its case again.’	只要铜片还在你衣服上，你都是自由的，直到你把它放回盒子里，你姑妈才会回来。”
 Then, rising, she nodded to Tephany and vanished.	语毕，她站起来，朝泰法妮点了点头，便消失不见了。
The girl stood where she was, as still as a stone.	泰法妮像块石头似的站在那里一动不动。
If it had not been for the pin in her hands she would have thought she was dreaming.	如果不是现在手上还拿着铜片，她真的以为自己是在做梦。
But by that token she knew it was no common old woman who had given it to her, but a fairy, wise in telling what would happen in the days to come.	但是看到老妇人给的铜片，泰法妮知道那并不是个普通的老妇，而是一个能够预知未来的神仙。
Then suddenly Tephany’s eyes fell on the clothes, and to make up for lost time she began to wash them with great vigour.	泰法妮突然想起来那堆衣服还没洗，便抓紧时间洗，想把和老妇人交谈的那会儿时间补回去。
Next evening, at the moment when Denis was accustomed to wait for her in the shadow of the cowhouse, Tephany stuck the pin in her dress, and at the very same instant Barbaik took up her sabots or wooden shoes and went through the orchard and past to the fields, to the plot where the cabbages grew.	第二天晚上，就在平时丹尼斯在牛舍附近等她的那个时间点，泰法妮将铜片贴到了衣服上。就在那一瞬间，巴尔贝居然真的拿起了她的木屐，穿过果园和田野，来到了种卷心菜的地方。
With a heart as light as her footsteps, the girl ran from the house, and spent her evening happily with Denis.	泰法妮脚步轻盈、心情愉悦地从房里跑出来，开心地和丹尼斯呆了很久。
And so it was for many days after that.	他们已经很多天没有见面了，自从上次的事情之后，这还是他们第一次见面。
Then, at last, Tephany began to notice something, and the something made her very sad.	就这样，他们一直在铜片的帮助下约会。然而，渐渐地，泰法妮注意到了一些事情，令她担忧起来。
At first, Denis seemed to find the hours that they were together fly as quickly as she did, but when he had taught her all the songs he knew, and told her all the plans he had made for growing rich and a great man, he had nothing more to say to her, for he, like a great many other people, was fond of talking himself, but not of listening to any one else.	起初，他们两个都觉得彼此在一起的时间过得飞快。但是当丹尼斯把所有他会的歌都教给了泰法妮，也告诉了她他想要变成一个成功的有钱人的雄心壮志和所有计划之后，就没有什么能跟她说的了。丹尼斯像大多数人一样，总是滔滔不绝地谈论他自己，而不愿意倾听他人之事。
Sometimes, indeed, he never came at all, and the next evening he would tell Tephany that he had been forced to go into the town on business, but though she never reproached him she was not deceived and saw plainly that he no longer cared for her as he used to do.	有时候，他甚至根本不来赴约，而是在第二晚向泰法妮解释他昨晚被逼着去镇里出差了。虽然泰法妮并没有指责他，但她也不再相信他的谎话了，她很清楚丹尼斯已经不像从前那么关心她了。
Day by day her heart grew heavier and her cheeks paler, and one evening, when she had waited for him in vain, she put her water-pot on her shoulder and went slowly down to the spring.	时间一天天过去，泰法妮心情越来越沉重，脸色也越来越苍白。有一晚，泰法妮痴痴地等着丹尼斯来赴约，无奈等待无果。她把水壶放在肩膀上，朝小溪慢慢走去。
On the path in front of her stood the fairy who had given her the pin, and as she glanced at Tephany she gave a little mischievous laugh and said:	路上，泰法妮又碰到了那位赠予她铜片的神仙，她此刻正站在泰法妮面前。老妇像个孩子般淘气地笑了笑，看了泰法妮一眼，说：
‘Why, my pretty maiden hardly looks happier than she did before, in spite of meeting her lover whenever she pleases.’	“噢，看看我美丽的女孩，只有看到她喜欢的男孩，她才会开心。可是，为什么她看上去一点儿都没有比从前快乐呢？”
‘He has grown tired of me,’ answered Tephany in a trembling voice, ‘and he makes excuses to stay away.	“他已经厌倦我了，”泰法妮用略带颤抖的声音答道，“他总是找借口躲着我。
Ah! granny dear, it is not enough to be able to see him, I must be able to amuse him and to keep him with me.	对了！亲爱的奶奶，仅仅让我与他见面，是远远不够的。我一定要能逗他开心，让他愿意和我呆在一起。
He is so clever, you know.	您知道的，他很聪明。
Help me to be clever too.’	所以，也请把我变聪明吧！”
‘Is that what you want?’ cried the old woman.	“这就是你想要的吗？”老妇问她,
‘Well, take this feather and stick it in your hair, and you will be as wise as Solomon himself.’	“那好吧，把这片羽毛拿去粘在你的头发上，你就会变得如同所罗门一样聪明。”
Blushing with pleasure Tephany went home and stuck the feather into the blue ribbon which girls always wear in that part of the country.	泰法妮心情大好，回到家里就把羽毛粘在了蓝丝带上。那里的女孩头上都会戴着蓝丝带。
In a moment she heard Denis whistling gaily, and as her aunt was safely counting her cabbages, she hurried out to meet him.	过了一会儿，她听到丹尼斯欢乐地吹着口哨，发现姑妈也正在数卷心菜。正是好机会，于是她迫不及待地去见丹尼斯了。
The young man was struck dumb by her talk.	泰法妮的巨大变化让丹尼斯目瞪口呆，哑口无言。
There was nothing that she did not seem to know, and as for songs she not only could sing those from every part of Brittany, but could compose them herself.	似乎没有什么事情是她不知道的，歌曲也是，她会唱布列塔尼不同地方的所有歌。不仅如此，她甚至可以自己创作歌曲。
Was this really the quiet girl who had been so anxious to learn all he could teach her, or was it somebody else?	丹尼斯疑惑着，这还是他从前认识的那个安静的女孩吗？曾经的她可是如此急切地渴望学习所有自己能教她的东西。难道这根本就是另一个人？
Perhaps she had gone suddenly mad, and there was an evil spirit inside her.	也许她是突然发疯了，又或者有个恶魔正在她身体里作祟。
But in any case, night after night he came back, only to find her growing wiser and wiser.	但是不管怎样，他每晚回去之后，都发现泰法妮变得越来越聪明了。
Soon the neighbours whispered their surprise among themselves, for Tephany had not been able to resist the pleasure of putting the feather in her hair for some of the people who despised her for her poor clothes, and many were the jokes she made about them.	没多久，邻居们也发现了此事，他们十分惊讶，纷纷在背地里讨论起来。因为泰法妮穿得寒碜而瞧不起她的那些人说了她不少闲话，他们时常纳闷儿：泰法妮为什么老把羽毛贴在蓝丝带上？泰法妮也“不甘示弱”，拿其中很多人开玩笑，以示捉弄。
Of course they heard of her jests, and shook their heads saying:	当然，那些人也都听说了泰法妮对他们的嘲笑，摇着头叹息道：
‘She is an ill-natured little cat, and the man that marries her will find that it is she who will hold the reins and drive the horse.’	“她就是个心地不良的人，娶了她的男人会发现什么事情都要由她掌权指挥，都得听她的。”
It was not long before Denis began to agree with them, and as he always liked to be master wherever he went, he became afraid of Tephany’s sharp tongue, and instead of laughing as before when she made fun of other people he grew red and uncomfortable, thinking that his turn would come next.	没过多久，丹尼斯也开始同意他们的观点了。他是个不管走到哪里都想要当头儿的人，对于泰法妮尖酸刻薄的说话方式，他也畏惧了。以前，当泰法妮取笑别人时，他也总在那里一起嘲笑他们。现在，当遇到这种事情，他会满脸通红，感到浑身不自在，心里暗暗担心可能下次就该轮到他遭殃了。
So matters went on till one evening Denis told Tephany that he really could not stay a moment, as he had promised to go to a dance that was to be held in the next village.	类似的事情还在继续，直到有一晚，丹尼斯告诉泰法妮他真的得走了，因为他已经答应了要去邻村参加舞会。
Tephany’s face fell; she had worked hard all day, and had been counting on a quiet hour with Denis.	泰法妮的脸拉得老长，不悦之情显而易见。她辛辛苦苦工作了一整天，无时无刻不在盼着能和丹尼斯呆在一起，享受那段甜蜜安静的时光。
She did her best to persuade him to remain with her, but he would not listen, and at last she grew angry.	她尽了全力想说服丹尼斯留在她身边，但是丹尼斯根本不听。说到最后，泰法妮也发怒了。
‘Oh, I know why you are so anxious not to miss the dance,’ she said; ‘it is because Aziliez of Pennenru will be there.’	“我知道你为什么生怕错过这个舞会了，”她说，“因为派内如的阿齐莉耶也会去。”
Now Aziliez was the loveliest girl for miles round, and she and Denis had known each other from childhood.	阿齐莉耶是方圆几英里内最可爱的女孩，她和丹尼斯从小就认识。
‘Oh yes, Aziliez will be there,’ answered Denis, who was quite pleased to see her jealous, ‘and naturally one would go a long way to watch her dance.’	“哦，的确如此，阿齐莉耶也会去，”丹尼斯回答，他看到泰法妮这样一个聪明绝顶的人居然也会嫉妒别人，心里反倒很开心，“不管要走多远的路去看她跳舞，人们自然都乐意得很。”
‘Go then!’ cried Tephany, and entering the house she slammed the door behind her.	“那你去呀！”泰法妮哭着跑进房里，砰的一声关上了门。
Lonely and miserable she sat down by the fire and stared into the red embers.	她在火堆旁坐下，绝望地盯着那红色的余烬，孤单和痛苦不断袭来。
Then, flinging the feather from her hair, she put her head on her hands, and sobbed passionately.	她一把扯下了粘在头发上的羽毛，抱头痛哭。
‘What is the use of being clever when it is beauty that men want?	“再聪明又有什么用？男人只喜欢美丽的女人。
That is what I ought to have asked for.	美貌才是我需要的。
But it is too late, Denis will never come back.’	但是现在一切都太晚了，丹尼斯再也不会回来了。”
‘Since you wish it so much you shall have beauty,’ said a voice at her side, and looking round she beheld the old woman leaning on her stick.	“既然你这么想要美貌，那我就给你美貌。”一个声音在她身旁响起。泰法妮回头一看，那老妇正倚着她的拐杖。
‘Fasten this necklace round your neck, and as long as you wear it you will be the most beautiful woman in the world,’ continued the fairy.	“把这条项链戴在你的脖子上，只要戴上这条项链，你就是世上最美丽的女人了。”老妇接着说。
With a little shriek of joy Tephany took the necklace, and snapping the clasp ran to the mirror which hung in the corner.	泰法妮兴奋地尖叫了起来，她接过项链，佩戴完毕，立刻冲到角落里照起了镜子。
Ah, this time she was not afraid of Aziliez or of any other girl, for surely none could be as fair and white as she.	这回，她什么女孩子都不用怕了，当然也包括阿齐莉耶，因为绝对没有人能像她那么白皙靓丽。
And with the sight of her face a thought came to her, and putting on hastily her best dress and her buckled shoes she hurried off to the dance.	看着镜子中如此美艳动人的自己，她忽然起了一个念头，然后连忙穿上了她最漂亮的衣服，扣好鞋子后就匆匆赶去舞会。
On the way she met a beautiful carriage with a young man seated in it.	在路上，她看到了一辆漂亮的马车，里面坐着一位年轻男子。
‘What a lovely maiden!’ he exclaimed, as Tephany approached.	泰法妮朝他走去。“多么美丽动人的姑娘啊！”他惊叹不已，
‘Why, there is not a girl in my own country that can be compared to her.	“在我的国家怎么就没有像她这样美貌的姑娘呢？
She, and no other, shall be my bride.’	除了她，没有人能成为我的新娘。”
The carriage was large and barred the narrow road, so Tephany was forced, much against her will, to remain where she was.	马车很大，把那条小路都堵住了，所以泰法妮不得不留在原地，尽管她其实非常不情愿。
But she looked the young man full in the face as she answered:	泰法妮直勾勾地瞪着他的脸，回答道：
‘Go your way, noble lord, and let me go mine.	“你走吧，贵族老爷，也请放我离开。
I am only a poor peasant girl, accustomed to milk, and make hay and spin.’	我只是一个贫穷的农家女，只会挤挤牛奶、晒晒干草，或者织织布而已。”
‘Peasant you may be, but I will make you a great lady,’ said he, taking her hand and trying to lead her to the carriage.	“你现在可能只是个农家女，但是请相信我，我会让你成为一个了不起的女人，”他说完便抓住了泰法妮的手，想带她上车。
‘I don’t want to be a great lady, I only want to be the wife of Denis,’ she replied, throwing off his hand and running to the ditch which divided the road from the cornfield, where he hoped to hide.	“我根本不想成为一个了不起的女人，我只想做丹尼斯的妻子。”泰法妮答道，她甩开他的手，向路边的沟渠跑去。沟渠另一边是片玉米田，她想躲到那里去。
Unluckily the young man guessed what she was doing, and signed to his attendants, who seized her and put her in the coach.	很不幸，那个年轻男子早就看透了泰法妮的心思，示意随从把她抓到马车里。
The door was banged, and the horses whipped up into a gallop.	门被重重地关上了，马飞奔起来。
At the end of an hour they arrived at a splendid castle, and Tephany, who would not move, was lifted out and carried into the hall, while a priest was sent for to perform the marriage ceremony.	一个小时后，他们来到了一个富丽堂皇的城堡。泰法妮根本动弹不得，任人抬进了大厅，男人甚至还找了一位牧师来主持婚礼。
The young man tried to win a smile from her by telling of all the beautiful things she should have as his wife, but Tephany did not listen to him, and looked about to see if there was any means by which she could escape.	为博红颜一笑，男人不停地在和泰法妮描述，如果成为他的妻子，生活能有多美好，但是泰法妮根本不理睬他。此刻，她正在想着如何脱身。
It did not seem easy.	但这似乎并不容易。
The three great doors were closely barred, and the one through which she had entered shut with a spring, but her feather was still in her hair, and by its aid she detected a crack in the wooden panelling, through which a streak of light could be dimly seen.	三扇大门都紧紧地关着，她刚刚被抬进来时经过的那扇门也被一把弹簧锁锁着。但是不要忘了，她的羽毛可还在头上呢。在它的帮助下，她发现了木质镶板上有一条裂缝，从裂缝看下去，一道光依稀可见。
Touching the copper pin which fastened her dress, the girl sent every one in the hall to count the cabbages, while she herself passed through the little door, not knowing whither she was going.	泰法妮碰了一下贴在衣服上的铜片，大厅里的所有人就都数卷心菜去了。而她自己呢，则穿过了那扇不知通往何处的小门。
By this time night had fallen, and Tephany was very tired.	夜幕降临的时候，泰法妮已经疲惫不堪。
Thankfully she found herself at the gate of a convent, and asked if she might stay there till morning.	值得庆幸的是，她发现面前正是一个修道院，便想着能在那里留宿一晚。
But the portress answered roughly that it was no place for beggars, and bade her begone, so the poor girl dragged herself slowly along the road, till a light and the bark of a dog told her that she was near a farm.	但是那个看门的女人一点儿都不近人情，只道她这里没有地方给乞丐住，将泰法妮赶走了。可怜的泰法妮只得拖着疲惫不堪的身体继续在路上挪动着，直到不远处的灯光映入眼帘，还伴着几声犬吠，泰法妮才意识到附近正是一个农场。
In front of the house was a group of people; two or three women and the sons of the farmer.	房子面前站着一群人——农场主的儿子们和两三个女人。
When their mother heard Tephany’s request to be given a bed the good wife’s heart softened, and she was just going to invite her inside, when the young men, whose heads were turned by the girl’s beauty, began to quarrel as to which should do most for her.	听了泰法妮的恳求，那位善良的母亲兼妻子顿时心软了，正打算请她到屋里。然而此刻，那些年轻的男人们一个个都转过头来盯着这个美丽的姑娘，开始抢着为泰法妮做事，还为此吵了起来。
From words they came to blows, and the women, frightened at the disturbance, pelted Tephany with insulting names.	没吵几句便开始动武，这让女人们惊慌失措，她们便不停地侮辱泰法妮，以此出气。
She quickly ran down the nearest path, hoping to escape them in the darkness of the trees, but in an instant she heard their footsteps behind her.	泰法妮只得赶紧就近寻找一条小径仓皇逃跑。她在黑黑的树林里拼命跑着，希望能躲过他们。但不幸的是，泰法妮马上又听到了他们紧随其后的脚步声。
Wild with fear her legs trembled under her, when suddenly she bethought herself of her necklace.	泰法妮吓得两腿发抖。此时，她突然想起这些都是自己的项链惹的祸。
With a violent effort she burst the clasp and flung it round the neck of a pig which was grunting in a ditch, and as she did so she heard the footsteps cease from pursuing her and run after the pig, for her charm had vanished.	于是她拼命一拉，扯下戴在脖子上的项链，扔到了沟渠里正在打呼噜的那头猪的脖子上。她扔了之后，那原本紧跟着她的脚步就都追那头猪去了。因为她若不戴项链，魅力也就同时消失了。
On she went, scarcely knowing where she was going, till she found herself, to her surprise and joy, close to her aunt’s house.	她继续走着，完全不知道自己在哪里，直到她又惊又喜地发现自己现在就在姑妈家附近。
For several days she felt so tired and unhappy that she could hardly get through her work, and to make matters worse Denis scarcely ever came near her.	接下来的好些天，她都觉得整个人疲惫不堪，整天闷闷不乐的，完全没法干农活。更糟糕的是，丹尼斯几乎从不来看她。
‘He was too busy,’ he said, ‘and really it was only rich people who could afford to waste time in talking.’	“我太忙了，”他为自己辩解道，“况且，也只有那些有钱人才有闲工夫聊天。”
As the days went on Tephany grew paler and paler, till everybody noticed it except her aunt.	日子一天天过去，泰法妮的脸色越来越苍白，除了她姑妈，所有人都注意到了。
The water-pot was almost too heavy for her now, but morning and evening she carried it to the spring, though the effort to lift it to her shoulder was often too much for her.	现在几乎连拎水壶对她来说都太重太重了。但即便如此，每天早晨和晚上，她还是得去泉眼那里打水。尽管对现在的她来说，连把水壶举到肩膀也是很难做到的事情。
‘How could I have been so foolish,’ she whispered to herself, when she went down as usual at sunset.	“我怎么会这么蠢！”她自言自语着，在落日时分像平时一样走在路上，
‘It was not freedom to see Denis that I should have asked for, for he was soon weary of me, nor a quick tongue, for he was afraid of it, nor beauty, for that brought me nothing but trouble, but riches which make life easy both for oneself and others.	“我该要的不是能见丹尼斯的自由，这样他很快就会厌倦我；也不是牙尖嘴利，他对此反倒十分畏惧；更不是美貌，这只给我添了很多麻烦。但是财富就不一样了，不论对自己还是他人而言，它能使生活变得容易许多。
Ah! if I only dared to beg this gift from the fairy, I should be wiser than before and know how to choose better.’	唉！要是我当时向老奶奶要这份礼物……我以前真是太笨了，我应该学聪明点儿，选个好点儿的礼物。”
‘Be satisfied,’ said the voice of the old woman, who seemed to be standing unseen at Tephany’s elbow.	“知足吧！”老妇的声音响起，她似乎一直默默地站在泰法妮边上，
‘If you look in your right-hand pocket when you go home you will find a small box.	“你回家之后看看你右边的口袋，里面有个小盒子。
Rub your eyes with the ointment it contains, and you will see that you yourself contain a priceless treasure.’	把盒里的药膏涂到眼睛上，到时候你就会知道，你自己就是一个无价之宝。”
Tephany did not in the least understand what she meant, but ran back to the farm as fast as she could, and began to fumble joyfully in her right-hand pocket.	泰法妮压根儿没明白她的意思，但还是以最快的速度跑回了农场，开始兴高采烈地翻找着右边的口袋。
Sure enough, there was the little box with the precious ointment.	果不其然，里面的确有个小盒子，装着看上去十分珍贵的药膏。
She was in the act of rubbing her eyes with it when Barbaik Bourhis entered the room.	当她正在涂抹药膏时，巴尔贝·布里进来了。
Ever since she had been obliged to leave her work and pass her time, she did not know why, in counting cabbages, everything had gone wrong, and she could not get a labourer to stay with her because of her bad temper.	最近，她日子清闲得很，好像总有股力量阻止着她去干活，她也不知道为什么会这样，自己老是在那里数卷心菜。所有事情都不太对。而且，因为她自己的暴脾气，她甚至找不到一个愿意帮她干活的劳工。
When, therefore, she saw her niece standing quietly before her mirror, Barbaik broke out:	所以此刻，当她看到侄女居然静静地站在镜子前照镜子，好像什么都没发生一样，巴尔贝气就不打一处来，破口大骂：
‘So this is what you do when I am out in the fields!	“我在田地里辛辛苦苦干活的时候，你就在弄这些吗？
Ah! it is no wonder if the farm is ruined.	啊！这样农场毁了也就一点儿都不奇怪了。
Are you not ashamed, girl, to behave so?’	你这样就不觉得羞耻吗？”
Tephany tried to stammer some excuse, but her aunt was half mad with rage, and a box on the ears was her only answer.	泰法妮结结巴巴地想找个借口，但是她姑妈此时早已气疯了，狠狠甩了泰法妮一个耳光。
At this Tephany, hurt, bewildered and excited, could control herself no longer, and turning away burst into tears.	平白无故地被打了一耳光，泰法妮这次真的受伤了。她很不解也很气愤，终于再也控制不住自己，转过身去号啕大哭。
But what was her surprise when she saw that each tear-drop was a round and shining pearl.	但令她吃惊的事情发生了，她看到自己流下的眼泪居然全都变成了一颗颗圆润闪亮的珍珠。
Barbaik, who also beheld this marvel, uttered a cry of astonishment, and threw herself on her knees to pick them up from the floor.	巴尔贝看到这神奇的一幕，一声惊呼，立刻跪在地上去捡那些珍珠。
She was still gathering them when the door opened and in came Denis.	丹尼斯推开门进来的时候，她正捡得不亦乐乎。
‘Pearls!	“珍珠！
Are they really pearls?’ he asked, falling on his knees also, and looking up at Tephany he perceived others still more beautiful rolling down the girl’s cheeks.	真的是珍珠吗？”丹尼斯兴奋不已，也跪在了地上，抬起头，发现正从泰法妮脸上滚下来的那些珍珠居然更漂亮。
‘Take care not to let any of the neighbours hear of it, Denis,’ said Barbaik.	“小心不要让邻居们知道，丹尼斯，”巴尔贝说，
‘Of course you shall have your share, but nobody else shall get a single one.	“当然，你可以得到一份，但是其他人想都甭想，一颗都没有。
Cry on, my dear, cry on,’ she continued to Tephany.	继续哭，亲爱的，继续哭呀！”她继续和泰法妮说，
It is for your good as well as ours,’ and she held out her apron to catch them, and Denis his hat.	“这是为你好，也为我们好。”接着，她解开了围裙来盛珍珠，丹尼斯则摘下了帽子。
But Tephany could hardly bear any more.	但泰法妮真的再也受不了了。
She felt half choked at the sight of their greediness, and wanted to rush from the hall, and though Barbaik caught her arm to prevent this, and said all sorts of tender words which she thought would make the girl weep the more, Tephany with a violent effort forced back her tears, and wiped her eyes.	看到他们如此贪婪，她顿时哽咽了。她想跑出去，但是巴尔贝抓着她的胳膊，不让她走，说尽了各种温柔的话。她认为这样可以让泰法妮哭得更厉害。泰法妮擦了擦眼睛，拼命地把眼泪憋回去。
‘Is she finished already?’ cried Barbaik, in a tone of disappointment.	“这就哭完了？”巴尔贝失望地喊着，
‘Oh, try again, my dear.	“亲爱的，再试一下。
Do you think it would do any good to beat her a little?’ she added to Denis, who shook his head.	你觉得打她会有用吗？”她又问丹尼斯，丹尼斯摇了摇头。
‘That is enough for the first time.	“第一次有这么多就够了。
I will go into the town and find out the value of each pearl.’	我会拿到镇里去看看值多少钱。”
‘Then I will go with you,’ said Barbaik, who never trusted anyone and was afraid of being cheated.	“那到时我和你一起去。”巴尔贝这个人从不相信任何人，总担心自己被骗。
So the two went out, leaving Tephany behind them.	两人就这样走了，留下泰法妮一人在屋子里。
She sat quite still on her chair, her hands clasped tightly together, as if she was forcing something back.	她坐在椅子上一动不动，两手紧紧地扣在一起，好像她正在拽什么东西。
At last she raised her eyes, which had been fixed on the ground, and beheld the fairy standing in a dark corner by the hearth, observing her with a mocking look.	当她抬起头，将目光从地板上移开，她看见老妇人正站在壁炉边上的一个黑暗角落里，略带嘲弄地看着自己。
The girl trembled and jumped up, then, taking the feather, the pin, and the box, she held them out to the old woman.	泰法妮颤抖地跳了起来，把羽毛、铜片和盒子全都递给了老妇。
‘Here they are, all of them,’ she cried; ‘they belong to you.	“都在这儿了，全部都在，”她哭泣着，“这些都是你的。
Let me never see them again, but I have learned the lesson that they taught me.	别让我再看到它们。但有一点，这些东西教会了我一个道理：
Others may have riches, beauty and wit, but as for me I desire nothing but to be the poor peasant girl I always was, working hard for those she loves.’	其他人可能拥有财富、美貌和智慧，但是对我来说，我只希望继续做那个贫穷的农家女，为自己所爱的东西而不懈努力。”
‘Yes, you have learned your lesson,’ answered the fairy, ‘and now you shall lead a peaceful life and marry the man you love.	“很好，你已经吸取了教训，”老人回答道，“现在你可以去嫁给你爱的男人，一起过你所向往的平静的生活。
For after all it was not yourself you thought of but him.’	其实，你完全不需要为了别人而改变自己。因为丹尼斯喜欢的不是你的美貌、智慧和财富，他喜欢的只是原来那个单纯善良、勤劳踏实的农家女泰法妮。认认真真地做好你自己，这就足够了。”
Never again did Tephany see the old woman, but she forgave Denis for selling her tears, and in time he grew to be a good husband, who did his own share of work.	泰法妮再也没有见过这个老妇。她原谅了丹尼斯出售她眼泪的行为。后来，丹尼斯成为了一个好丈夫，勤勤恳恳地干着自己的工作。
