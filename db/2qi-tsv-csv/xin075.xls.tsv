书名《法西诺·卡内》（巴尔扎克短篇小说）短简介《法西诺·卡内》这篇文章通过一位与众不同的盲人老人的回忆讲述了一个由无尽贪欲引发的故事。对于金钱的狂热和痴迷，放荡不羁生活，情人之间的种种欺骗，即便是曾经享受过炫目的豪奢也终究敌不过繁华终归散场的命运。长简介法国现实主义作家巴尔扎克在他的中篇小说《法西诺·卡内》中，通过一位与众不同的盲人老人的回忆讲述了一个由无尽贪欲引发的故事。对于金钱的狂热和痴迷，放荡不羁生活，情人之间的种种欺骗，即便是曾经享受过炫目的豪奢也终究敌不过繁华终归散场的命运。巴尔扎克对现实主义文学最大的贡献在于他对典型人物形象和社会风俗的细致刻画，并表达人物性格在社会环境中的变化和发展。他以编年史的方式描绘了上升中的资产阶级对贵族社会日甚一日的冲击。这篇文章对精神现象有具体、显豁的说明：“在我身上，观察已经变成直觉的了，它深入灵魂却不忽视形体，或更可以说，它一下子抓住外部细节，随即超越之；它赋予我一种能力，使我亲历它所及的个人的生活，使我代替了他，就像《一千零一夜》中的苦行僧，他向那些人说几句话，就得到了他们的灵魂和肉体。”其观察力和批判力都显得鞭辟入里，内容深刻。关键字法西诺·卡内；巴尔扎克；外研社编译组；黄金；情人；逃犯；盲人；婚礼；单簧管；威尼斯；贪欲作者（法）巴尔扎克作者简介巴尔扎克（1799年5月20日—1850年8月18日），法国19世纪著名作家，法国现实主义文学成就最高者之一。他创作的《人间喜剧》共91部小说，写了两千四百多个人物，是人类文学史上罕见的文学丰碑，被称为法国社会的“百科全书”。

Facino Cane	法西诺·卡内
by Honoré de Balzac	作者：巴尔扎克
I once used to live in a little street which probably is not known to you—the Rue de Lesdiguieres.	我曾经住在一条小巷——莱斯迪吉埃尔街上，您大概不熟悉这条街。
It is a turning out of the Rue Saint-Antoine, beginning just opposite a fountain near the Place de la Bastille, and ending in the Rue de la Cerisaie.	它从圣安东尼街开始，面对巴士底广场附近的喷水池，一直通到樱桃园街。
Love of knowledge stranded me in a garret; my nights I spent in work, my days in reading at the Bibliotheque d’Orleans, close by.	出于对知识的热爱，我别无他法，只能住在一间阁楼里，晚上在家用功，白天在附近的奥尔良国家图书馆度过。
I lived frugally; I had accepted the conditions of the monastic life, necessary conditions for every worker, scarcely permitting myself a walk along the Boulevard Bourdon when the weather was fine.	我过着粗茶淡饭的日子。修道士一样的生活对发奋图强的人是不可避免的，我事先已经对这种生活条件有心理准备了。即使在晴好的天气里，我也难得在布尔东大街漫步。
One passion only had power to draw me from my studies; and yet, what was that passion but a study of another kind?	唯有一种激情使我能从勤奋的习惯中抽身，然而，这难道不也是一种研究吗？
I used to watch the manners and customs of the Faubourg, its inhabitants, and their characteristics.	我常去观察郊区的生活方式、地方风俗、当地居民和他们的性格。
As I dressed no better than a working man, and cared nothing for appearances, I did not put them on their guard; I could join a group and look on while they drove bargains or wrangled among themselves on their way home from work.	我穿得和工人差不多，根本不关心外表，绝不会让他们对我存有戒心。我可以混到他们当中，看他们讨价还价，或者是干完活以后吵嘴骂街。
Even then observation had come to be an instinct with me; a faculty of penetrating to the soul without neglecting the body; or rather, a power of grasping external details so thoroughly that they never detained me for a moment, and at once I passed beyond and through them.	在我身上，观察甚至已经变成了一种本能，既不忽略外表，又能鞭辟入里；更确切地说，我能够全面抓住外部细节，一眼看透它们，使它们丝毫阻止不了我的深入分析。
I could enter into the life of the human creatures whom I watched, just as the dervish in the Arabian Nights could pass into any soul or body after pronouncing a certain formula.	当我观察人的时候，我进入那个人的生活，就像《一千零一夜》中的苦行僧一样，念出某种咒语之后就能附在别人的身体和灵魂上。
If I met a working man and his wife in the streets between eleven o’clock and midnight on their way home from the Ambigu Comique, I used to amuse myself by following them from the Boulevard du Pont aux Choux to the Boulevard Beaumarchais.	如果我在十一点至午夜之间，碰到一个工人和他的妻子一起从昂比居喜剧院回来，我会兴味盎然地尾随他们，从卷心菜桥大街一直到博马舍大街。
The good folk would begin by talking about the play; then from one thing to another they would come to their own affairs, and the mother would walk on and on, heedless of complaints or question from the little one that dragged at her hand, while she and her husband reckoned up the wages to be paid on the morrow, and spent the money in a score of different ways.	起初，这些人会聊刚看过的那出戏；逐渐地，他们会谈到自家这样那样的事情；做母亲会牵着孩子一直走路，既不听孩子的埋怨，也不听他的要求。这对夫妇在计算第二天会拿到多少工钱，他们有各种各样的花销。
Then came domestic details, lamentations over the excessive dearness of potatoes, or the length of the winter and the high price of block fuel, together with forcible representations of amounts owing to the baker, ending in an acrimonious dispute, in the course of which such couples reveal their characters in picturesque language.	然后他们会谈到家务琐事，抱怨土豆价格太贵了，冬天太漫长了，煤块涨价了；提醒切记还欠着面包店的钱。末了，讨论激烈起来，他们用生动的言语互相揭短。
As I listened, I could make their lives mine, I felt their rags on my back, I walked with their gaping shoes on my feet; their cravings, their needs, had all passed into my soul, or my soul had passed into theirs.	听着这些人说话，我能体会他们的生活，感到自己身上穿着他们的褴褛衣服，脚上穿着他们有洞的鞋子。他们的愿望、需要全都进入我的心灵，或者我的心灵融入他们的心灵之中。
It was the dream of a waking man.	这就像一个醒着的人在做梦。
I waxed hot with them over the foreman’s tyranny, or the bad customers that made them call again and again for payment.	对于那些虐待他们的工头，或者去催了好几次也不付钱的恶劣主顾，我也同他们一样气愤难平。
To come out of my own ways of life, to be another than myself through a kind of intoxication of the intellectual faculties, and to play this game at will, such was my recreation.	摆脱自己的习惯，由于心理官能的兴奋变成另外一个人，随心所欲地进行这种游戏，这就是我的娱乐。
Whence comes the gift?	我这种天赋是哪里来的？
Is it a kind of second sight?	这是一种预见力吗？
Is it one of those powers which when abused end in madness?	这种能力滥用之后会导致疯狂吗？
I have never tried to discover its source; I possess it, I use it, that is all.	我从来没有研究过这种能耐的来龙去脉。我具有这种能耐，并加以运用，如此而已。
But this it behooves you to know, that in those days I began to resolve the heterogeneous mass known as the People into its elements, and to evaluate its good and bad qualities.	不过要知道，从那时起，我把所谓人民这一异质并存的整体分解成各个部分，并加以剖析，以便能估量它的好品质和坏品质。
Even then I realized the possibilities of my suburb, that hotbed of revolution in which heroes, inventors, and practical men of science, rogues and scoundrels, virtues and vices, were all packed together by poverty, stifled by necessity, drowned in drink, and consumed by ardent spirits.	我深刻了解这个城区的所有可能性。在这个城区、这个革命的策源地里，英雄、发明家、注重实际的科学家、无赖、坏蛋、德行和恶习鱼龙混杂，这一切都受到贫困的压制，因各种需要而喘不过气来，他们狂饮滥喝，烈酒耗尽了他们的精力。
You would not imagine how many adventures, how many tragedies, lie buried away out of sight in that Dolorous City; how much horror and beauty lurks there.	你不能想象，在这个痛苦之城，有多少奇遇被埋没了，有多少惨剧被遗忘了！有多少可怕的和美好的事物潜伏于此啊！
No imagination can reach the Truth, no one can go down into that city to make discoveries; for one must needs descend too low into its depths to see the wonderful scenes of tragedy or comedy enacted there, the masterpieces brought forth by chance.	想象力绝不能触及隐藏在这些事物当中的真实画面，也没有人能够发现它们；必须深入到底层，才能看到这些悲剧性或喜剧性的精彩场面，而这些场面都是偶然产生的杰作。
I do not know how it is that I have kept the following story so long untold.	下文即将叙述的故事，我不知道我怎么会保密这么久。
It is one of the curious things that stop in the bag from which Memory draws out stories at haphazard, like numbers in a lottery.	这个故事属于我脑袋里保存的奇异故事之一，如同摸彩票一样，我从回忆中随意把它摸了出来。
There are plenty of tales just as strange and just as well hidden still left; but some day, you may be sure, their turn will come.	我还有许多别的故事，跟这个一样古怪，同样我都深藏于心。但请相信，到时候一个个都会讲出来的。
One day my charwoman, a working man’s wife, came to beg me to honor her sister’s wedding with my presence.	有一天，我家的小时工、一个工人的妻子，来请我屈驾光临她妹妹的婚礼。
If you are to realize what this wedding was like you must know that I paid my charwoman, poor creature, four francs a month; for which sum she came every morning to make my bed, clean my shoes, brush my clothes, sweep the room, and make ready my breakfast, before going to her day’s work of turning the handle of a machine, at which hard drudgery she earned five-pence.	为了让您明白这个婚礼会办成什么排场，必须告诉您，我每月给这个可怜的女人四个法郎，她每天上午来给我收拾床铺、擦鞋、刷洗衣服、打扫房间、做早餐。她用余下的时间去操作一台机器干活。她这样辛苦劳作，每天也就挣五个便士。
Her husband, a cabinetmaker, made four francs a day at his trade; but as they had three children, it was all that they could do to gain an honest living.	她的丈夫是个细工木匠，一天挣四个法郎。但这对夫妇有三个孩子，所以他们仅能维持温饱生活。
Yet I have never met with more sterling honesty than in this man and wife.	我从未见过比这对夫妇更忠厚耿直的人。
For five years after I left the quarter, Mere Vaillant used to come on my birthday with a bunch of flowers and some oranges for me—she that had never a sixpence to put by!	后来，我离开了这一区。在离开后的五年中，瓦扬大妈总是来向我祝贺生日，给我带来一束鲜花和橘子——而她从未有过六个便士的积蓄！
Want had drawn us together.	贫穷使我们亲近起来。
I never could give her more than a ten-franc piece, and often I had to borrow the money for the occasion.	我只能给她十个法郎，而且往往要为此借债。
This will perhaps explain my promise to go to the wedding; I hoped to efface myself in these poor people’s merry-making.	这就能解释我为什么答应参加婚礼了。我打算领略一下这些穷人的欢乐。
The banquet and the ball were given on a first floor above a wineshop in the Rue de Charenton.	婚宴和舞会都是在沙朗通街一家酒店二楼的大房间里举行的。
It was a large room, lighted by oil lamps with tin reflectors.	房间很大，马口铁罩子里的油灯把房间照得通亮。
A row of wooden benches ran round the walls, which were black with grime to the height of the tables.	齐桌高的墙纸脏兮兮的，沿墙放着一排木头长凳。
Here some eighty persons, all in their Sunday best, tricked out with ribbons and bunches of flowers, all of them on pleasure bent, were dancing away with heated visages as if the world were about to come to an end.	这个房间里大约有八十个人，都穿着节日盛装，捧着鲜花，系着丝带。大家都尽情欢乐，面孔红彤彤的，仿佛世界就要完结一样地疯狂跳舞。
Bride and bridegroom exchanged salutes to the general satisfaction, amid a chorus of facetious “Oh, ohs!” and “Ah, ahs!” less really indecent than the furtive glances of young girls that have been well brought up.	新婚夫妇互相致敬，直到大家满意为止。大家乐不可支，一片嘻嘻哈哈的笑声，但比大家闺秀羞答答的眉来眼去委实要得体。
There was something indescribably infectious about the rough, homely enjoyment in all countenances.	这些人表达的是粗犷的快活，有一种难以形容的感染力。
But neither the faces, nor the wedding, nor the wedding-guests have anything to do with my story.	但是，无论这个宴会的情景，还是婚礼和这些人，都与我的故事无关。
Simply bear them in mind as the odd setting to it.	只要记住环境的怪异就行了。
Try to realize the scene, the shabby red-painted wineshop, the smell of wine, the yells of merriment; try to feel that you are really in the faubourg, among old people, working men and poor women giving themselves up to a night’s enjoyment.	请好好设想一间漆成红色的肮脏酒店，酒气氤氲，四周都是喧闹声，而您就身处其中，置身于沉醉在一夜狂欢的工人、老人和可怜的妇女中间。
The band consisted of a fiddle, a clarionet, and a flageolet from the Blind Asylum.	乐队由盲人院的三个瞎子组成：第一个是提琴手，第二个是吹单簧管的，第三个吹竖笛。
The three were paid seven francs in a lump sum for the night.	三个人吹一夜，统共得到七个法郎。
For the money, they gave us, not Beethoven certainly, nor yet Rossini; they played as they had the will and the skill; and every one in the room (with charming delicacy of feeling) refrained from finding fault.	当然，这样的价钱，他们既不演奏罗西尼的作品，也不演奏贝多芬的曲子，他们拣会的曲子随意吹奏。房间里的人都不会去责备他们，这种温文尔雅多么迷人啊！
The music made such a brutal assault on the drum of my ear, that after a first glance round the room my eyes fell at once upon the blind trio, and the sight of their uniform inclined me from the first to indulgence.	音乐十分刺耳，所以我第一次扫视全场，一下子就看到了这盲人三重奏。认出了他们的制服以后，我立刻原谅了他们。
As the artists stood in a window recess, it was difficult to distinguish their faces except at close quarters, and I kept away at first; but when I came nearer (I hardly know why) I thought of nothing else; the wedding party and the music ceased to exist, my curiosity was roused to the highest pitch, for my soul passed into the body of the clarionet player.	这些艺人是呆在窗洞下的。要看清他们的面容，非得在他们旁边才行。我没有马上走过去，但当我走近时（我也不知道为什么），我没有想别的事；这时，婚礼和音乐都消失了，我的好奇心激发到顶点，因为我的灵魂已潜入单簧管吹奏者的躯体。
The fiddle and the flageolet were neither of them interesting; their faces were of the ordinary type among the blind—earnest, attentive, and grave.	提琴手和竖笛手的面孔都平淡无奇，就是那种众所周知的盲人的脸孔——肌肉紧张、全神贯注、神情肃穆。
Not so the clarionet player; any artist or philosopher must have come to a stop at the sight of him.	但是单簧管乐手的脸却是那种能一下子吸引住艺术家和哲学家的脸。
Picture to yourself a plaster mask of Dante in the red lamplight, with a forest of silver-white hair above the brows.	请您想象一个有着一头浓密的银发的但丁的石膏面具，被油罐灯的红光照亮了。
Blindness intensified the expression of bitterness and sorrow in that grand face of his; the dead eyes were lighted up, as it were, by a thought within that broke forth like a burning flame, lit by one sole insatiable desire, written large in vigorous characters upon an arching brow scored across with as many lines as an old stone wall.	失明加深了他这张宽阔的脸盘上凄凉痛苦的神情；死气沉沉的双眼被像火焰一样喷薄而出的思想点亮了，它来源于独特的、持续不断的欲望，这欲望有力地镌刻在隆起的额角上，一道道皱纹有如一层层的古老墙壁，横穿额头。
The old man was playing at random, without the slightest regard for time or tune.	这个老人随意吹奏，丝毫不注意节奏和曲调。
His fingers traveled mechanically over the worn keys of his instrument; he did not trouble himself over a false note now and again (a canard, in the language of the orchestra), neither did the dancers, nor, for that matter, did my old Italian’s acolytes; for I had made up my mind that he must be Italian, and an Italian he was.	他的手指时起时落，出于机械的习惯，按着老旧的单簧片。即使时不时吹出一些乐队所谓的走音，他也不在乎，跳舞的人也不在乎，连这个意大利老人的两个同伴也没有发觉。我期望他是个意大利人，而他确实是意大利人。
There was something great, something too of the despot about this old Homer bearing within him an Odyssey doomed to oblivion.	这是位大人物，是位隐忍的君王，是位年迈的荷马，他内心保存着一部注定要被人遗忘的《奥德赛》。
The greatness was so real that it triumphed over his abject position; the despotism so much a part of him, that it rose above his poverty.	在他身上，可以看到某种崇高而专横的东西。这种崇高确实存在，连贫贱也被它战胜了。
There are violent passions which drive a man to good or evil, making of him a hero or a convict; of these there was not one that had failed to leave its traces on the grandly-hewn, lividly Italian face.	强烈的激情可以使人为善，也可以使人作恶，可以使人成为苦役犯，也可以使人成为英雄。他轮廓高贵、颜色苍白的意大利人的脸，就流露出这种激情。
You trembled lest a flash of thought should suddenly light up the deep sightless hollows under the grizzled brows, as you might fear to see brigands with torches and poniards in the mouth of a cavern.	灰白的浓眉在深陷的眼窝投下阴影，看到从中闪现出思想的光芒，你就会发抖，就像看到手持火把和匕首的强盗来到洞口一样令人恐惧。
You felt that there was a lion in that cage of flesh, a lion spent with useless raging against iron bars.	你会感到有一只狮子呆在这个血肉之躯的牢笼里，对着铁栅咆哮，直到精疲力竭，还是毫无用处。
The fires of despair had burned themselves out into ashes, the lava had cooled; but the tracks of the flames, the wreckage, and a little smoke remained to bear witness to the violence of the eruption, the ravages of the fire.	绝望生成的大火已经灰飞烟灭，喷出的熔岩也已冷却；但这些灰烬、残骸和这一缕轻烟，却表明了火山爆发的猛烈和大火的蹂躏达到何种程度。
These images crowded up at the sight of the clarionet player, till the thoughts now grown cold in his face burned hot within my soul.	看到这个单簧管演奏者，我心中涌现出无数画面，我的灵魂剧烈地燃烧直到冷却，正如思想早已在他的脸上冷却那样。
The fiddle and the flageolet took a deep interest in bottles and glasses; at the end of a country-dance, they hung their instruments from a button on their reddish-colored coats, and stretched out their hands to a little table set in the window recess to hold their liquor supply.	提琴手和竖笛手很爱喝酒。演奏完土风舞曲，他们将乐器挂在淡红色的礼服纽扣上，向用作餐室的窗洞的那张小桌子伸出手去取酒。
Each time they did so they held out a full glass to the Italian, who could not reach it for himself because he sat in front of the table, and each time the Italian thanked them with a friendly nod.	每次，他们都将一杯斟满的酒递给意大利人，因为他正好背朝桌子坐着，他无法亲自去拿酒杯。那个意大利人每次都友好地点点头，感谢他们。
All their movements were made with the precision which always amazes you so much at the Blind Asylum.	他们的动作完成得非常准确，总是会让人对这些盲人院的瞎子们感到惊讶。
You could almost think that they can see.	你几乎都会以为他们看得见东西。
I came nearer to listen; but when I stood beside them, they evidently guessed I was not a working man, and kept themselves to themselves.	我挨近这三个盲人，想听他们讲话。但当我来到他们身边时，很明显他们猜测出我不是工人，于是闷声不响了。
“What part of the world do you come from, you that are playing the clarionet?”	“吹单簧管的那位，您是什么地方人？” 
“From Venice,” he said, with a trace of Italian accent.	“威尼斯人。”盲人带着轻微的意大利口音回答。
“Have you always been blind, or did it come on afterwards—”	“您是生来就瞎了，还是后来有什么事——” 
“Afterwards,” he answered quickly.	“后来的事，”他很快回答，
“A cursed gutta serena.”	“得了该死的青光眼。”
“Venice is a fine city; I have always had a fancy to go there.”	“威尼斯是一座美丽的城市，我总是想去那里逛逛。” 
The old man’s face lighted up, the wrinkles began to work, he was violently excited.	老人的表情亢奋起来，皱纹颤动不已，他异常激动。
“If I went with you, you would not lose your time,” he said.	“如果我同您一起去，您就不会浪费时间了。”他对我说。
“Don’t talk about Venice to our Doge,” put in the fiddle, “or you will start him off, and he has stowed away a couple of bottles as it is—has the prince!”	“别跟他谈威尼斯，”提琴手对我说，“否则我们的总督又要旧调重弹了，况且他已经两瓶酒下肚了呢——已经成了亲王了！”
“Come, strike up, Daddy Canard!” added the flageolet, and the three began to play.	“得了，开始吧，走音老爹。”吹笛子的说。三个人又开始演奏。 
But while they executed the four figures of a square dance, the Venetian was scenting my thoughts; he guessed the great interest I felt in him.	但他们为方块舞演奏舞曲时，威尼斯人觉察出我在旁边，猜出我对他怀有浓厚的兴趣。
The dreary, dispirited look died out of his face, some mysterious hope brightened his features and slid like a blue flame over his wrinkles.	他的脸摆脱了愁苦冰冷的表情。说不准是什么希望使他的脸豁然开朗，似乎有一股蓝色的火焰注入他的皱纹中。
He smiled and wiped his brow, that fearless, terrible brow of his, and at length grew gay like a man mounted on his hobby.	他微笑着擦拭那无惧而可怕的额头。他终于像一个拣起自己喜爱的话题的人那样，喜笑颜开。
“How old are you?”	“您多大岁数了？”
I asked.	我问他。
“Eighty-two.”	“82岁！”
“How long have you been blind?”	“您失明有多久了？”
“For very nearly fifty years,” he said, and there was that in his tone which told me that his regret was for something more than his lost sight, for great power of which he had been robbed.	“快五十年了。”他回答，那种语调表明他不仅惋惜失去了视力，而且惋惜被剥夺了巨大的权力。
“Then why do they call you ‘the Doge’?”	“那为什么他们管您叫‘总督’？”
I asked.	我问道。
“Oh, it is a joke.	“啊！这是开玩笑，
I am a Venetian noble, and I might have been a doge like any one else.”	我是威尼斯的贵族，本来我像别人一样会成为总督。”
“What is your name?”	“您究竟叫什么名字？”
“Here, in Paris, I am Pere Canet,” he said.	“在巴黎这儿，我是卡内老爹，”他说，
“It was the only way of spelling my name on the register.	“这是我户口本上唯一的名字。
But in Italy I am Marco Facino Cane, Prince of Varese.”	但是在意大利，我就是马尔科·法西诺·卡内，瓦雷泽领主。” 
“What, are you descended from the great condottiere Facino Cane, whose lands won by the sword were taken by the Dukes of Milan?”	“怎么！您是大名鼎鼎的雇佣兵队长法西诺·卡内的后裔吗？他征服的地方后来转到了米兰几位公爵的手里。”
“E vero,” returned he.	“是的，”他对我说，
“His son’s life was not safe under the Visconti; he fled to Venice, and his name was inscribed on the Golden Book.	“那时，由于维斯孔蒂家族的追杀，卡纳的后人很不安全。卡内的儿子避居在威尼斯，在名人录上登记了名字。
And now neither Cane or Golden Book are in existence.”	可是现在这本名人录没有了，卡内家族也一样烟消云散了。”
His gesture startled me; it told of patriotism extinguished and weariness of life.	他做了一个令人惊愕的手势，显示了他的爱国精神已经熄灭，对人间事物也已厌恶。
“But if you were once a Venetian senator, you must have been a wealthy man.	“但是既然您曾经当过威尼斯的上议院议员，那么您一定富有过。
How did you lose your fortune?”	您怎么会失去财产的？”
“In evil days.”	“在不幸中失去的！”
He waved away the glass of wine handed to him by the flageolet, and bowed his head.	这时，竖笛手递给他一杯酒。他推开了酒，垂下了头。
He had no heart to drink.	他没心情喝酒了。
These details were not calculated to extinguish my curiosity.	这些细节并未消除我的好奇。
As the three ground out the music of the square dance, I gazed at the old Venetian noble, thinking thoughts that set a young man’s mind afire at the age of twenty.	在那三件乐器机械地演奏着方块舞曲时，我怀着在二十岁的青年心中激荡不已的情感，注视着这个年迈的威尼斯贵族。
I saw Venice and the Adriatic; I saw her ruin in the ruin of the face before me.	我看到了威尼斯和亚得里亚海，我在这张衰颓的脸上看到了威尼斯的废墟。
I walked to and fro in that city, so beloved of her citizens; I went from the Rialto Bridge, along the Grand Canal, and from the Riva degli Schiavoni to the Lido, returning to St. Mark’s, that cathedral so unlike all others in its sublimity.	我来往漫步在当地居民如此珍视的城市里，从里亚尔托走到大运河，从斯拉夫人沿河大街走到利多半岛，再回到壮丽崇高、富有独创性的大教堂。
I looked up at the windows of the Casa Doro, each with its different sculptured ornaments; I saw old palaces rich in marbles, saw all the wonders which a student beholds with the more sympathetic eyes because visible things take their color of his fancy, and the sight of realities cannot rob him of the glory of his dreams.	我看到卡萨多罗的窗户，每扇窗都有不同的装饰；我观赏着这些富丽堂皇的、古老的大理石大厦。我看到了所有的奇迹，一个学者会看得更有共鸣，因为看得见的东西会被他的想象蒙上色彩；他也会对这些奇迹更感兴趣；即使看到实际的景物，也不会使他的梦想失去诗意。
Then I traced back a course of life for this latest scion of a race of condottieri, tracking down his misfortunes, looking for the reasons of the deep moral and physical degradation out of which the lately revived sparks of greatness and nobility shone so much the more brightly.	然后，我对这位最伟大的雇佣兵队长的后裔的生活历程追根溯源，寻找他的不幸的痕迹和他心力交瘁的原因，但这种憔悴使他此刻迸发的庄严崇高的火花显得更加美丽。
My ideas, no doubt, were passing through his mind, for all processes of thought-communications are far more swift, I think, in blind people, because their blindness compels them to concentrate their attention.	我的想法无疑也传达给了他，因为我相信，失明使人的注意力不再分散到外界事物上去，所以使精神交流更加迅速。
I had not long to wait for proof that we were in sympathy in this way.	我们俩的心灵感应很快得到了证实。
Facino Cane left off playing, and came up to me.	法西诺·卡内不再吹奏，他站起身，向我走来。
“Let us go out!” he said; his tones thrilled through me like an electric shock.	“咱们出去吧！”他说，这说话的口气对我产生的效果就像电击一样。
I gave him my arm, and we went.	我让他挽住我的手臂，我们俩走了出去。
Outside in the street he said, “Will you take me back to Venice?	我们来到了街上，他对我说：“你愿意带我回威尼斯吗？
Will you be my guide?	你愿意当我的向导吗？
Will you put faith in me?	你信任我吗？
You shall be richer than ten of the richest houses in Amsterdam or London, richer than Rothschild; in short, you shall have the fabulous wealth of the Arabian Nights.”	你将会比阿姆斯特丹或伦敦的十大富豪更有钱，比罗斯柴尔德家族更有钱，总之，你会像《一千零一夜》所描写的那样富有。” 
The man was mad, I thought; but in his voice there was a potent something which I obeyed.	我心想，这个人疯了。但他的嗓音里有一种威慑力，令我不得不服从。
I allowed him to lead, and he went in the direction of the Fosses de la Bastille, as if he could see; walking till he reached a lonely spot down by the river, just where the bridge has since been built at the junction of the Canal Saint-Martin and the Seine.	我让他带我向前走去，他就像真能看得见似的，带我向巴士底监狱的方向走，一直到了河边一个僻静的位置。后来那里建了一座桥，圣马丹运河跟塞纳河之间才通行无阻。
Here he sat down on a stone, and I, sitting opposite to him, saw the old man’s hair gleaming like threads of silver in the moonlight.	他找了块石头坐下，我坐在老人对面。月光下，老人的白发宛若银丝一般闪烁。
The stillness was scarcely troubled by the sound of the far-off thunder of traffic along the boulevards; the clear night air and everything about us combined to make a strangely unreal scene.	林荫大道的嘈杂声很难传到我们这里，几乎一点儿都没有扰乱周围的静寂，再加上夜晚天清气朗，一切都促使这个场面显得超乎寻常的神奇。
“You talk of millions to a young man,” I began, “and do you think that he will shrink from enduring any number of hardships to gain them?	我先开口了：“您对一个年轻人谈到百万财富，您以为他会踟蹰不前，不敢历尽千难万险去获得这笔财富吗？
Are you not laughing at me?”	您这不是在嘲弄我吗？”
“May I die unshriven,” he cried vehemently, “if all that I am about to tell you is not true.	他气鼓鼓地对我说：“如果我要告诉您的话是假的，就让我死时得不到忏悔。
I was one-and-twenty years old, like you at this moment.	我那时就像您眼下这样，只有二十一岁。
I was rich, I was handsome, and a noble by birth.	我富有、英俊，生来就是个贵族。
I began with the first madness of all—with Love.	我做的第一件疯狂的事就是——恋爱。
I loved as no one can love nowadays.	我爱得那么深，如今没人能比得上我。
I have hidden myself in a chest, at the risk of a dagger thrust, for nothing more than the promise of a kiss.	我甚至躲在一只箱子里，甘愿被人捅一刀，仅仅只为了得到一吻的许诺。
To die for Her—it seemed to me to be a whole life in itself.	为她而死——在我看来这辈子也值了。
In 1760 I fell in love with a lady of the Vendramin family; she was eighteen years old, and married to a Sagredo, one of the richest senators, a man of thirty, madly in love with his wife.	1760年，我爱上了旺德拉米尼家的一个女子。她年方十八，嫁给萨格雷多家，她的丈夫是最富有的议员之一，三十来岁，发狂地爱着他的妻子。
My mistress and I were guiltless as cherubs when the sposo caught us together talking of love.	我的情妇和我，我们俩就像两个小天使一样纯洁无疵。这时，她丈夫发现我们在谈情说爱。
He was armed, I was not, but he missed me; I sprang upon him and killed him with my two hands, wringing his neck as if he had been a chicken.	他拿着剑，我手无寸铁，可是他没有刺中我。我向他扑去，像扭小鸡脖子一样，用双手把他掐死了。
I wanted Bianca to fly with me; but she would not.	我想让毕昂卡和我一起逃走，但她不愿意。
That is the way with women!	女人们就是这样！
So I went alone.	我只能独自离开。
I was condemned to death, and my property was confiscated and made over to my next-of-kin; but I had carried off my diamonds, five of Titian’s pictures taken down from their frames and rolled up, and all my gold.	我被判了刑，他们没收了我的财产，转给了我的近亲。但是我已带走了我的钻石、五幅卷起来的提香的画和我所有的金子。
“I went to Milan, no one molested me, my affair in nowise interested the State.—One small observation before I go further,” he continued, after a pause, “whether it is true or no that the mother’s fancies at the time of conception or in the months before birth can influence her child, this much is certain, my mother during her pregnancy had a passion for gold, and I am the victim of a monomania, of a craving for gold which must be gratified.	“在讲下去以前，先说两句——我来到米兰，用不着惴惴不安，因为我的事丝毫牵涉不到当局。”他停了片刻，又说，“不管一个女人在受孕或怀胎时，她的怪念头对孩子有无影响，但可以确定的是，我的母亲怀上我时对金子很狂热，所以弄得我对黄金有一种癖好，而且这种癖好必须得到满足。
Gold is so much of a necessity of life for me, that I have never been without it; I must have gold to toy with and finger.	金子是我生活的必需品，以致无论我处在什么情况下，身上总带着金子。我必须经常抚摸金子。
As a young man I always wore jewelry, and I carried two or three hundred ducats about me wherever I went.”	作为一个年轻人，我总是戴着首饰，身上总带着两三百杜卡托。”
He drew a couple of gold coins from his pocket and showed them to me as he spoke.	说着，他从口袋里掏出两个杜卡托，递给我看。
“I can tell by instinct when gold is near.	“如果附近有金子，我凭着感觉就能感受到。
Blind as I am, I stop before a jeweler’s shop windows.	虽然现在眼睛看不见，但是我时常在珠宝店橱窗前流连。
That passion was the ruin of me; I took to gambling to play with gold.	这种嗜好毁了我。为了把玩金子，我成了赌徒。
I was not a cheat, I was cheated, I ruined myself.	我不是骗子，我被别人骗了。我把自己毁了。
I lost all my fortune.	我输了个倾家荡产。
Then the longing to see Bianca once more possessed me like a frenzy.	我失去财产以后，发狂地想见到毕昂卡。
I stole back to Venice and found her again.	我偷偷地回到威尼斯，找到了她。
For six months I was happy; she hid me in her house and fed me.	整整六个月，我过得很幸福。她把我藏在家里，供养着我。
I thought thus deliciously to finish my days.	我想着就这么舒舒服服地度过一生。
But the Provveditore courted her, and guessed that he had a rival; we in Italy can feel that.	但是，省总督也追求着她。这个人猜出自己有一个情敌，我们意大利人凭感觉就能感觉到这一点。
He played the spy upon us, and surprised us together in bed, base wretch.	他监视我们，在床上抓住我们，这卑鄙小人！
You may judge what a fight for life it was; I did not kill him outright, but I wounded him dangerously.	你可以想象我们的搏斗多么激烈。我没有痛痛快快地杀死他，但是他受了重伤。
“That adventure broke my luck.	“这个遭遇毁了我的幸运。
I have never found another Bianca; I have known great pleasures; but among the most celebrated women at the court of Louis XV.	从这天起，我再也找不到毕昂卡了。此后我也曾纵情欢乐，涉足路易十五的宫廷，生活在声名显赫的贵妇之中。
I never found my beloved Venetian’s charm, her love, her great qualities.	我再也没有找到我钟爱的威尼斯女人所拥有的妩媚、爱情和高贵品质。
“The Provveditore called his servants, the palace was surrounded and entered; I fought for my life that I might die beneath Bianca’s eyes; Bianca helped me to kill the Provveditore.	“省总督把他的仆人召集起来，包围和攻入宫廷。我竭力自卫，死也要死在毕昂卡的眼前，她一直在帮我去杀死省总督。
Once before she had refused flight with me; but after six months of happiness she wished only to die with me, and received several thrusts.	以前这个女人不肯同我一起逃走，但过了半年的幸福生活以后，她愿意同我一起死去，而且为我身中数刀。
I was entangled in a great cloak that they flung over me, carried down to a gondola, and hurried to the Pozzi dungeons.	他们用一件大氅蒙在我身上，把我裹起来，扛到一艘小船上，运到一个地牢里关起来。
I was twenty-two years old.	那时，我二十二岁。
I gripped the hilt of my broken sword so hard, that they could only have taken it from me by cutting off my hand at the wrist.	我捏紧了半截断剑，谁想要夺走它，就非得砍掉我的手不可。
A curious chance, or rather the instinct of self-preservation, led me to hide the fragment of the blade in a corner of my cell, as if it might still be of use.	出于奇怪的巧合，更确切地说，出于小心谨慎，我把这截剑藏在一个角落里，好像我还能用得着它似的。
They tended me; none of my wounds were serious.	他们治好了我的伤。我受的伤都不是致命的。
At two-and-twenty one can recover from anything.	二十二岁的年轻人在什么情况下都会恢复健康。
I was to lose my head on the scaffold.	我本来该上断头台了。
I shammed illness to gain time.	我装作生病来争取时间。
It seemed to me that the canal lay just outside my cell.	我估摸着，自己应该是呆在与运河相邻的黑牢里。
I thought to make my escape by boring a hole through the wall and swimming for my life.	我的计划是挖墙开洞，游过运河逃出去。
I based my hopes on the following reasons.	我的希望基于以下理由。
“Every time that the jailer came with my food, there was light enough to read directions written on the walls—‘Side of the Palace,’ ‘Side of the Canal,’ ‘Side of the Vaults.’	“每次监狱看守给我送饭时，我就看到墙上所写的标明方向的字：‘靠宫殿’、‘靠运河’、‘靠地道’。
At last I saw a design in this, but I did not trouble myself much about the meaning of it; the actual incomplete condition of the Ducal Palace accounted for it.	最终，我琢磨出一幅平面图，图形的方向我倒并不在意，但可以解释为尚未竣工的公爵府目前的状况是如此。
The longing to regain my freedom gave me something like genius.	想要恢复自由的愿望给了我无穷的智慧。
Groping about with my fingers, I spelled out an Arabic inscription on the wall.	我用指尖去摸墙上石头的表面，终于辨别出阿拉伯文的说明字句。
The author of the work informed those to come after him that he had loosed two stones in the lowest course of masonry and hollowed out eleven feet beyond underground.	刻文字的人告诉他的后继者，他已挖松了最后一层墙石的两块石头，并且挖了十一尺的地道。
As he went on with his excavations, it became necessary to spread the fragments of stone and mortar over the floor of his cell.	既然他要继续做下去，就必须把挖出来的碎石和灰泥洒在黑牢的地上。
But even if jailers and inquisitors had not felt sure that the structure of the building was such that no watch was needed below, the level of the Pozzi dungeons being several steps below the threshold, it was possible gradually to raise the earthen floor without exciting the warder’s suspicions.	监狱看守和审讯的人不大放心监狱的构造，所以下层仍需要人看守。即使这样，由于下到地牢要经过几级台阶，地牢的布局就能够在逐渐抬高地面的过程中使看守无法觉察。
“The tremendous labor had profited nothing—nothing at least to him that began it.	“这项大工程是白费力气了——至少对于最初挖掘的人来说是这样。
The very fact that it was left unfinished told of the unknown worker’s death.	工程没有完成，那只能表明这个陌生人已经死了。
Unless his devoted toil was to be wasted for ever, his successor must have some knowledge of Arabic, but I had studied Oriental languages at the Armenian Convent.	为了使他的献身精神不至于付诸东流，他的继任者必须懂阿拉伯文，而我曾在亚美尼亚人的修道院里研读过东方语言。
A few words written on the back of the stone recorded the unhappy man’s fate; he had fallen a victim to his great possessions; Venice had coveted his wealth and seized upon it.	那块石头后面刻写的一句话，道出了这个不幸者的命运。他因财丧命，威尼斯觊觎他的巨大财产，攫为己有。
A whole month went by before I obtained any result; but whenever I felt my strength failing as I worked, I heard the chink of gold, I saw gold spread before me, I was dazzled by diamonds.—Ah! wait.	我得花一个月才能有个结果。每当我干活干到精疲力竭的时候，我便听到金子的声音，看到金子散落在我眼前，被钻石闪得眼花！——啊，等一等！
“One night my blunted steel struck on wood.	“有一夜，我那把磨钝的剑碰到了木头。
I whetted the fragment of my blade and cut a hole; I crept on my belly like a serpent; I worked naked and mole-fashion, my hands in front of me, using the stone itself to gain a purchase.	我磨快那截剑，要在木头上钻一个洞。为了干活方便，我像一条蛇那样匍匐在地，赤裸着身子，像鼹鼠那样干活，双手在前，用那块石头作支撑点。
I was to appear before my judges in two days’ time, I made a final effort, and that night I bored through the wood and felt that there was space beyond.	在我要出庭受审的前两天夜里，我想作最后一次努力。我钻穿了木头。我的剑在那头没碰到东西。
“Judge of my surprise when I applied my eye to the hole.	“当我将眼睛凑在窟窿上的时候，请想想我有多惊讶吧！
I was in the ceiling of a vault, heaps of gold were dimly visible in the faint light.	我发现自己在一间地窖里，在微弱的灯下可以看到大堆的金子。
The Doge himself and one of the Ten stood below; I could hear their voices and sufficient of their talk to know that this was the Secret Treasury of the Republic, full of the gifts of Doges and reserves of booty called the Tithe of Venice from the spoils of military expeditions.	总督本人和十人委员会中的一员，正在这个小地窖里。我听到他们的说话声，并从他们的谈话中知道，共和国的秘密宝库就在这里，有历届总督的赠予和远征掠夺来的、称为威尼斯国库的战利品储存物。
I was saved!	我能活命了！
“When the jailer came I proposed that he should help me to escape and fly with me, and that we should take with us as much as we could carry.	“待监狱看守进来时，我向他提议帮我逃走，同我一起席卷我们能带走的一切。
There was no reason for hesitation; he agreed.	他没有犹豫的理由，便同意了。
Vessels were about to sail for the Levant.	有艘帆船要开往黎凡特。
All possible precautions were taken.	一切准备就绪。
Bianca furthered the schemes which I suggested to my accomplice.	我向同谋讲的措施，毕昂卡一一促成。
It was arranged that Bianca should only rejoin us in Smyrna for fear of exciting suspicion.	为了避免引起怀疑，毕昂卡要在士麦那与我们会合。
In a single night the hole was enlarged, and we dropped down into the Secret Treasury of Venice.	一夜工夫，洞口就挖大了，我们进入了威尼斯的秘密宝库里。
“What a night that was!	“多么难忘的一夜啊！
Four great casks full of gold stood there.	地窖里有四只装满金子的大桶。
In the outer room silver pieces were piled in heaps, leaving a gangway between by which to cross the chamber.	在外面一个房间，银币也堆成两堆，贴墙斜放，中间留出一条通道。
Banks of silver coins surrounded the walls to the height of five feet.	银币堆得像山一样，把五尺高的墙都遮住了。
“I thought the jailer would go mad.	“我觉得那狱卒都快疯了。
He sang and laughed and danced and capered among the gold, till I threatened to strangle him if he made a sound or wasted time.	他又唱，又跳，又笑，在黄金上蹦蹦跳跳，直到我吓唬他说，要是他浪费时间，或者闹出响声，就把他掐死。
In his joy he did not notice at first the table where the diamonds lay.	他欣喜若狂，起先没有看到一张堆满钻石的桌子。
I flung myself upon these, and deftly filled the pockets of my sailor jacket and trousers with the stones.	我十分敏捷地扑过去，把钻石装满我的水手上衣和长裤口袋。
Ah!	啊！
Heaven, I did not take the third of them.	天哪，我拿的还不到三分之一呢。
Gold ingots lay underneath the table.	这张桌子下面放着金条。
I persuaded my companion to fill as many bags as we could carry with the gold, and made him understand that this was our only chance of escaping detection abroad.	我说服我的同伴将金子尽量多地装满口袋，直到我们拿不走为止。我告诉他，这是在国外逃避侦查的唯一方法。
“‘Pearls, rubies, and diamonds might be recognized,’ I told him.	“珍珠、首饰、钻石会让人认出我们。”我对他说。
“Covetous though we were, we could not possibly take more than two thousand livres weight of gold, which meant six journeys across the prison to the gondola.	“不管我们多么贪婪，我们只能拿走两千斤金子，这需要从监狱到船上来回搬六次。
The sentinel at the water gate was bribed with a bag containing ten livres weight of gold; and as far as the two gondoliers, they believed they were serving the Republic.	我们用一袋十里弗重的金子收买了通往河边那个门口的哨兵。至于两个船夫，他们以为在为共和国效劳。
At daybreak we set out.	破晓时我们动身了。
“Once upon the open sea, when I thought of that night, when I recollected all that I had felt, when the vision of that great hoard rose before my eyes, and I computed that I had left behind thirty millions in silver, twenty in gold, and many more in diamonds, pearls, and rubies—then a sort of madness began to work in me.	“我们到了无垠的大海上。我开始回忆这一夜的情景和当时的感受，重新盘算起这巨大的宝库。据我的估算，我留下的有三千万银币、两千万黄金和几百万钻石、珍珠和红宝石——我的内心开始躁动不已。
I had the gold fever.	我对黄金贪得无厌。
“We landed at Smyrna and took ship at once for France.	“我们在士麦那上岸，随即又坐船开往法国。
As we went on board the French vessel, Heaven favored me by ridding me of my accomplice.	由于我们上了一艘法国船，上帝给我开恩，让我摆脱了我的同谋。
I did not think at the time of all the possible consequences of this mishap, and rejoiced not a little.	当时，我不去想这件碰巧干下的坏事会有什么后果，只觉得好不快活。
We were so completely unnerved by all that had happened, that we were stupid, we said not a word to each other, we waited till it should be safe to enjoy ourselves at our ease.	我们紧张过度，坐在那里发呆，默默无言。我们等待安全无虞之后，可以痛痛快快地享乐。
It was not wonderful that the rogue’s head was dizzy.	这家伙昏头昏脑是不足为怪的。
You shall see how heavily God has punished me.	你会看到上帝给了我多么严重的惩罚。
“I never knew a quiet moment until I had sold two-thirds of my diamonds in London or Amsterdam, and held the value of my gold dust in a negotiable shape.	“直到在伦敦和阿姆斯特丹卖掉三分之二的钻石，并把零碎黄金兑换成商业证券，我才感到放心。
For five years I hid myself in Madrid, then in 1770 I came to Paris with a Spanish name, and led as brilliant a life as may be.	我在马德里躲了五年。后来，1770年，我用一个西班牙假名来到了巴黎，生活过得极其奢华。
Then in the midst of my pleasures, as I enjoyed a fortune of six millions, I was smitten with blindness.	当时我拥有六百万财产。就在纵情欢乐之中，我双目失明了。
I do not doubt but that my infirmity was brought on by my sojourn in the cell and my work in the stone, if, indeed, my peculiar faculty for ‘seeing’ gold was not an abuse of the power of sight which predestined me to lose it.	我毫不怀疑，我的残疾也是由于在黑牢呆过，挖掘石块的结果。但是，实际上，基于我的特殊才能——爱‘看黄金’导致视力使用过度，也是注定了要失明的。
Bianca was dead.	毕昂卡已经去世。
“At this time I had fallen in love with a woman to whom I thought to link my fate.	“那时，我深爱着一个女人，打算与她共结连理。
I had told her the secret of my name; she belonged to a powerful family; she was a friend of Mme. du Barry; I hoped everything from the favor shown me by Louis XV.; I trusted in her.	我对她说出了我姓名的秘密。她属于一个很有势力的家族，她是杜巴里夫人的朋友。我期望路易十五给我隆恩，我很信任这个女人。
Acting on her advice, I went to London to consult a famous oculist, and after a stay of several months in London she deserted me in Hyde Park.	根据她的建议，我去看伦敦的一个著名的眼科大夫。但是，在伦敦待了几个月以后，这个女人将我抛弃在海德公园。
She had stripped me of all that I had, and left me without resource.	她把我的全部财产席卷一空，不给我留下一丁点儿钱。
Nor could I make complaint, for to disclose my name was to lay myself open to the vengeance of my native city; I could appeal to no one for aid, I feared Venice.	我无处抱怨，我的真名会招致威尼斯方面的报复，我只得隐姓埋名，无法乞哀告怜，我害怕威尼斯。
The woman put spies about me to exploit my infirmity.	这个女人事先安排了一些暗探盯住我，我的残疾正好为他们所利用。
I spare you a tale of adventures worthy of Gil Blas.—Your Revolution followed.	我的遭遇堪与吉尔·布拉斯相比，我就不再赘述了。你们的大革命紧接着就爆发了。
For two whole years that creature kept me at the Bicetre as a lunatic, then she gained admittance for me at the Blind Asylum; there was no help for it, I went.	我不得不进了盲人院。这个女人把我当疯子一样在比塞特收容院关了两年，才让我进了这个盲人院。虽然那里对我的病并无益处，可我还是去了。
I could not kill her; I could not see; and I was so poor that I could not pay another arm.	我根本杀不了她，我什么也看不见，而且我太穷，雇不起帮手。
“If only I had taken counsel with my jailer, Benedetto Carpi, before I lost him, I might have known the exact position of my cell, I might have found my way back to the Treasury and returned to Venice when Napoleon crushed the Republic—	“如果我在失去我的监狱看守贝内代托·卡尔皮之前，曾向他打听过那个黑牢的位置，我就能再找到那个宝库，在拿破仑征服了共和国以后，我可能已经找到办法回到威尼斯——
“Still, blind as I am, let us go back to Venice!	“尽管我眼瞎了，我们还是要到威尼斯去！
I shall find the door of my prison, I shall see the gold through the prison walls, I shall hear it where it lies under the water; for the events which brought about the fall of Venice befell in such a way that the secret of the hoard must have perished with Bianca’s brother, Vendramin, a doge to whom I looked to make my peace with the Ten.	我会找到那座监狱的门，透过墙壁看到金子，我会嗅出埋在水底下的黄金。因为推翻威尼斯当局的事件来势汹汹，这个宝库的秘密大概同毕昂卡的兄弟文德拉米诺一起逝去了。他当过总督，我希望他已为我取得十人委员会的谅解。
I sent memorials to the First Consul; I proposed an agreement with the Emperor of Austria; every one sent me about my business for a lunatic.	我给第一执政写过信，也曾向奥地利皇帝提议订个协议，但他们都把我当作疯子，婉言拒绝了！
Come! we will go to Venice; let us set out as beggars, we shall come back millionaires.	来吧！我们一起动身上威尼斯，出发时是乞丐，回来时就会是百万富翁。
We will buy back some of my estates, and you shall be my heir!	我们赎回我的产业，您将是我的继承人！
You shall be Prince of Varese!”	您将是瓦雷泽亲王！”
My head was swimming.	我的头晕晕乎乎的。
For me his confidences reached the proportions of tragedy; at the sight of that white head of his and beyond it the black water in the trenches of the Bastille lying still as a canal in Venice, I had no words to answer him.	在我看来，他的这种信心只能给他带来悲剧。我看着他的满头白发，还有他身后巴士底的壕沟黑黝黝的水，这静止的水好似威尼斯运河的河水，我实在想不出用什么语言答复他。
Facino Cane thought, no doubt, that I judged him, as the rest had done, with a disdainful pity; his gesture expressed the whole philosophy of despair.	毋庸置疑，法西诺·卡内肯定以为我像别人一样看待他。他带着又怜悯又蔑视的态度做了一个手势，这手势包涵了失望的全部内涵。
Perhaps his story had taken him back to happy days and to Venice.	这番叙述或许又把他带回到威尼斯那些幸福的日子里。
He caught up his clarionet and made plaintive music, playing a Venetian boat-song with something of his lost skill, the skill of the young patrician lover.	他抓起单簧管，忧郁地吹起了一支威尼斯歌曲。在演奏这首船夫曲时，他恢复了早年的才华，多情贵族的那种才华。
It was a sort of Super flumina Babylonis.	这首曲子有点儿像演奏《巴比伦河畔》。
Tears filled my eyes.	我泪水盈眶。
Any belated persons walking along the Boulevard Bourdon must have stood still to listen to an exile’s last prayer, a last cry of regret for a lost name, mingled with memories of Bianca.	倘若有几个迟归的路人刚巧经过波尔东大街，不用说，他们会停住脚步，倾听这个被放逐的人最后的祈愿，倾听一个隐姓埋名的人最后的怀念，其中还混合了对毕昂卡的缅怀。
But gold soon gained the upper hand, the fatal passion quenched the light of youth.	但不久金钱欲又占据了上风，这种无法抵御的嗜好使青春之光熄灭了。
“I see it always,” he said; “dreaming or waking, I see it; and as I pace to and fro, I pace in the Treasury, and the diamonds sparkle.	“我总是能看见它，”他对我说，“无论醒着还是在梦中，我始终看到它，我在宝库里面踱步，钻石闪闪发光。
I am not as blind as you think; gold and diamonds light up my night, the night of the last Facino Cane, for my title passes to the Memmi.	我并不像您以为的那样看不见东西，黄金和钻石照亮了我的黑夜，最后一个法西诺·卡内的黑夜，因为我的贵族头衔已转给梅米家了。
My God! the murderer’s punishment was not long delayed!	天啊！对我杀人的惩罚来得实在太早了！
Ave Maria,” and he repeated several prayers that I did not heed.	圣母玛利亚……”他又重复了几首悼词，但是我没有听清楚。
“We will go to Venice!” I said, when he rose.	“我们一起到威尼斯去！”我在他站起来的时候说道。
“Then I have found a man!” he cried, with his face on fire.	“我终于找到了一个人！”他脸色潮红地嚷道。
I gave him my arm and went home with him.	我让他挽住我的胳膊，把他送回去。
We reached the gates of the Blind Asylum just as some of the wedding guests were returning along the street, shouting at the top of their voices.	我们走到盲人院的门口，这时，有几个参加婚礼的人回来了，大声高喊着。
He squeezed my hand.	他握紧我的手。
“Shall we start to-morrow?” he asked.	“我们明天就出发？”他问道。
“As soon as we can get some money.”	“等我们有了钱就马上动身。”
“But we can go on foot.	“可是，我们可以走着去。
I will beg.	我沿途行乞。
I am strong, and you feel young when you see gold before you.”	我身子骨很硬朗，而且一个人只要看到金子在眼前，就会觉得年轻。”
Facino Cane died before the winter was out after a two months’ illness.	法西诺·卡内在冬天生了两个月的病，然后就与世长辞了。
The poor man had taken a chill.	可怜的人患的是重伤风。
PARIS, March 1836.	1836年3月，于巴黎。
