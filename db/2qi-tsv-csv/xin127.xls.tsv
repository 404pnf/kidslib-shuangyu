The Enchanted Head	魔法人头	
by Andrew Lang	作者：安德鲁·朗格	
Once upon a time an old woman lived in a small cottage near the sea with her two daughters.	很久很久以前，在大海附近的一座小农舍里，住着一位老妇人和她的两个女儿。	
They were very poor, and the girls seldom left the house, as they worked all day long making veils for the ladies to wear over their faces, and every morning, when the veils were finished, the other took them over the bridge and sold them in the city.	她们很穷，女孩们很少离开屋子，因为她们要整天制作戴在女士们脸上的面纱。每天早上，当面纱做好后，老妇人就会带着它们从桥上走过，到城里去卖掉。	
Then she bought the food that they needed for the day, and returned home to do her share of veil-making.	然后，她会购买她们当天所需的食物，接着返回家里继续制作面纱，完成自己的工作。	
One morning the old woman rose even earlier than usual, and set off for the city with her wares.	一天早上，老妇人比往常起得早了一点儿，带着她的商品就向城里出发了。	
She was just crossing the bridge when, suddenly, she knocked up against a human head, which she had never seen there before.	就在她过桥的时候，突然，她碰见了一个人头，她以前在那里从没有见过。	
The woman started back in horror; but what was her surprise when the head spoke, exactly as if it had a body joined on to it.	妇人惊吓得往后退，但是让她惊讶的是，当人头说话时完全就好像有一个身体和它结合在一起。	
‘Take me with you, good mother!’ it said imploringly; ‘take me with you back to your house.’	“带上我吧，好心的母亲！”它恳求地说，“把我带回你的家吧。”	
At the sound of these words the poor woman nearly went mad with terror.	听到这些话，可怜的妇人几乎害怕得发疯了。	
Have that horrible thing always at home?	让那个可怕的东西一直呆在家里？	
Never! never!	绝不！绝不！	
And she turned and ran back as fast as she could, not knowing that the head was jumping, dancing, and rolling after her.	于是她转身尽可能快地往回跑，却不知道人头正蹦着、跳着、滚着跟在她后面。	
But when she reached her own door it bounded in before her, and stopped in front of the fire, begging and praying to be allowed to stay.	当她到达门口时，人头在她之前跳了进去，然后在火炉前停了下来，恳求妇人把它留下来。	
All that day there was no food in the house, for the veils had not been sold, and they had no money to buy anything with.	那一整天，屋子里都没有食物，因为面纱没有卖出去，她们没有钱去买任何东西。	
So they all sat silent at their work, inwardly cursing the head which was the cause of their misfortunes.	因此她们都沉默地坐在那里工作，内心诅咒着这个导致她们不幸的人头。	
When evening came, and there was no sign of supper, the head spoke, for the first time that day:	当夜幕降临时，依然没有晚餐的迹象，人头那天第一次说话了。	
‘Good mother, does no one ever eat here?	“好心的母亲，这里从来没有人吃饭吗？	
During all the hours I have spent in your house not a creature has touched anything.’	我在您屋子里的这几个小时里，没有一个人吃任何东西。”	
‘No,’ answered the old woman, ‘we are not eating anything.’	“是的，”老妇人回答说，“我们什么都没吃。”	
‘And why not, good mother?’	“好心的母亲，那是为什么呢？”	
‘Because we have no money to buy any food.’	“因为我们没有钱去买任何食物。”	
‘Is it your custom never to eat?’	“从来不吃是你们的习惯吗？”	
‘No, for every morning I go into the city to sell my veils, and with the few shillings I get for them I buy all we want.	“不，因为每天早上我到城里去卖面纱，用卖得的几先令去买我们所需要的食物。	
To-day I did not cross the bridge, so of course I had nothing for food.’	今天我没有过桥，当然也就没有钱买食物了。”	
‘Then I am the cause of your having gone hungry all day?’ asked the head.	“那么我就是你们一整天挨饿的原因吗？”人头问道。	
‘Yes, you are,’ answered the old woman.	“是的，你就是。”老妇人回答说。	
‘Well, then, I will give you money and plenty of it, if you will only do as I tell you.	“好吧，那么只要你按照我告诉你的做，我就会给你钱，充足的钱。	
In an hour, as the clock strikes twelve, you must be on the bridge at the place where you met me.	一小时后，当时钟敲响第十二下时，你必须到桥上那个你遇见我的地方。	
When you get there call out “Ahmed,” three times, as loud as you can.	当你到那里时，大声喊三次‘艾哈迈德’。	
Then a negro will appear, and you must say to him: “The head, your master, desires you to open the trunk, and to give me the green purse which you will find in it.”’	然后一个黑人就会出现，你必须对他说：‘你的人头主人要求你打开箱子，把在里面找到的绿色钱包给我。’”	
‘Very well, my lord,’ said the old woman, ‘I will set off at once for the bridge.’	“好的，我的主人，”老妇人说，“我这就出发去桥上。”	
And wrapping her veil round her she went out.	她围上面纱就出去了。	
Midnight was striking as she reached the spot where she had met the head so many hours before.	等她到达几个小时前与人头相遇的地方时，午夜的钟声敲响了。	
‘Ahmed!	“艾哈迈德！	
Ahmed!	艾哈迈德！	
Ahmed!’ cried she, and immediately a huge negro, as tall as a giant, stood on the bridge before her.	艾哈迈德！”她叫喊着，一个和巨人一样高大的黑人立即出现在桥上，站在她面前。	
‘What do you want?’ asked he.	“你想要什么？”他问道。	
‘The head, your master, desires you to open the trunk, and to give me the green purse which you will find in it.’	“你的人头主人要求你打开箱子，把在里面找到的绿色钱包给我。”	
‘I will be back in a moment, good mother,’ said he.	“我一会儿就回来，好心的母亲。”他说。	
And three minutes later he placed a purse full of sequins in the old woman’s hand.	三分钟之后，他将一个满是亮片的钱包交到了老妇人手上。	
No one can imagine the joy of the whole family at the sight of all this wealth.	没人能想象全家人看到这笔财富时的喜悦。	
The tiny, tumble-down cottage was rebuilt, the girls had new dresses, and their mother ceased selling veils.	又小又破的农舍得到了重建，女孩子们有了新衣服，她们的母亲也不再卖面纱。	
It was such a new thing to them to have money to spend, that they were not as careful as they might have been, and by-and-by there was not a single coin left in the purse.	对她们来说，有钱花是一件如此新鲜的事情，以至于她们没有尽可能地精打细算，不久钱包里一个硬币都不剩了。	
When this happened their hearts sank within them, and their faces fell.	当这种情况发生时，她们的心都沉了，脸也拉长了。	
‘Have you spent your fortune?’ asked the head from its corner, when it saw how sad they looked.	看到她们如此悲伤，角落里的人头就问道：“你们花完了你们所有的财富了吗？	
‘Well, then, go at midnight, good mother, to the bridge, and call out “Mahomet!” three times, as loud as you can.	好吧，好心的母亲，午夜到桥上去，尽可能大声地叫三次‘穆罕默德’。	
A negro will appear in answer, and you must tell him to open the trunk, and to give you the red purse which he will find there.’	一个黑人将会回应你，你必须告诉他打开箱子，并把他在里面找到的红色钱包给你。”	
The old woman did not need twice telling, but set off at once for the bridge.	老妇人并不需要听它重复两遍，就立即出发去桥上了。	
‘Mahomet!	“穆罕默德！	
Mahomet!	穆罕默德！	
Mahomet!’ cried she, with all her might; and in an instant a negro, still larger than the last, stood before her.	穆罕默德！”她使劲大喊着，一个比上次更高大的黑人瞬间就站在了她面前。	
‘What do you want?’ asked he.	“你想要什么？”他问道。	
‘The head, your master, bids you open the trunk, and to give me the red purse which you will find in it.’	“你的人头主人命令你打开箱子，把在里面找到的红色钱包给我。”	
‘Very well, good mother, I will do so,’ answered the negro, and, the moment after he had vanished, he reappeared with the purse in his hand.	“好的，好心的母亲，我会照办的。”黑人回答道。他消失一会儿后，手上拿着钱包就又出现了。	
This time the money seemed so endless that the old woman built herself a new house, and filled it with the most beautiful things that were to be found in the shops.	这次钱似乎无穷无尽了，于是老妇人为自己建了一个新房子，里面放满了商店里卖的最漂亮的东西。	
Her daughters were always wrapped in veils that looked as if they were woven out of sunbeams, and their dresses shone with precious stones.	她的女儿们总是裹着面纱，面纱看上去像是用阳光织出来的一样，她们的衣服上也闪耀着宝石的光芒。	
The neighbours wondered where all this sudden wealth had sprung from, but nobody knew about the head.	邻居们很好奇这突如其来的一切财富是从何而来，但是没有人知道人头的事。	
‘Good mother,’ said the head, one day, ‘this morning you are to go to the city and ask the sultan to give me his daughter for my bride.’	“好心的母亲，”一天，人头说道，“你今天早上去城里叫苏丹把他的女儿嫁给我当新娘。”	
‘Do what?’ asked the old woman in amazement.	“做什么？”老妇人吃惊地问，	
‘How can I tell the sultan that a head without a body wishes to become his son-in-law?	“我怎么能告诉苏丹，一个没有身体的人头希望成为他的女婿呢？	
They will think that I am mad, and I shall be hooted from the palace and stoned by the children.’	他们会认为我疯了，我会从皇宫里被轰出来，也会被孩子们用石头砸的。”	
‘Do as I bid you,’ replied the head; ‘it is my will.’	“按照我吩咐你的做，”人头回答说，“这是我的意愿。”	
The old woman was afraid to say anything more, and, putting on her richest clothes, started for the palace.	老妇人不敢多说什么，穿上她最富有的衣服，就向皇宫出发了。	
The sultan granted her an audience at once, and, in a trembling voice, she made her request.	苏丹立刻允许觐见她，她用颤抖的声音说出了她的请求。	
‘Are you mad, old woman?’ said the sultan, staring at her.	“老妇人，你疯了吗？”苏丹盯着她说。	
‘The wooer is powerful, O Sultan, and nothing is impossible to him.’	“求婚者很强大，尊敬的苏丹，对他来说没什么是不可能的。”	
‘Is that true?’	“真的吗？”	
‘It is, O Sultan; I swear it,’ answered she.	“是的，苏丹，我发誓是真的。”她回答道。	
‘Then let him show his power by doing three things, and I will give him my daughter.’	“那就让他通过做三件事展示他的能力，做得好的话，我就会把我的女儿嫁给他。”	
‘Command, O gracious prince,’ said she.	“遵命，尊贵的国王。”她说。	
‘Do you see that hill in front of the palace?’ asked the sultan.	“你看到皇宫前面的那座山了吗？”苏丹问。	
‘I see it,’ answered she.	“我看到了。”她回答说。	
‘Well, in forty days the man who has sent you must make that hill vanish, and plant a beautiful garden in its place.	“好，派你来的人必须在四十天内让那座山消失，再在原来的地方建一座美丽的花园。	
That is the first thing.	那是第一件事。	
Now go, and tell him what I say.’	现在走吧，告诉他我所说的。”	
So the old woman returned and told the head the sultan’s first condition.	于是老妇人就回去把苏丹的第一个条件告诉了人头。	
‘It is well,’ he replied; and said no more about it.	“好的。”他回答道，就什么也没说了。	
For thirty-nine days the head remained in its favourite corner.	接下来的三十九天里，人头都呆在它喜欢的角落里。	
The old woman thought that the task set before was beyond his powers, and that no more would be heard about the sultan’s daughter.	老妇人认为之前设定的任务超过了他的能力，再也不会听到它谈论苏丹女儿的事了。	
But on the thirty-ninth evening after her visit to the palace, the head suddenly spoke.	但是在她去皇宫后的第三十九天晚上，人头突然说话了。	
‘Good mother,’ he said, ‘you must go to-night to the bridge, and when you are there cry “Ali!	“好心的母亲，”他说，“今晚你必须到桥上去，到了那里就喊：‘阿里！	
Ali!	阿里！	
Ali!” as loud as you can.	阿里’，要尽可能大声地喊。	
A negro will appear before you, and you will tell him that he is to level the hill, and to make, in its place, the most beautiful garden that ever was seen.’	一个黑人将会出现在你面前，你告诉他去把山夷平，在原来的地方建一座最漂亮的花园。”	
‘I will go at once,’ answered she.	“我立即就去。”她回答说。	
It did not take her long to reach the bridge which led to the city, and she took up her position on the spot where she had first seen the head, and called loudly ‘Ali!	没过多久，她就来到通往城里的那座桥上，她站在第一次见到人头的地方大声地喊道：“阿里！	
Ali!	阿里！	
Ali.’	阿里！”	
In an instant a negro appeared before her, of such a huge size that the old woman was half frightened; but his voice was mild and gentle as he said: ‘What is it that you want?’	黑人瞬间就出现在她面前，他是如此巨大，以至于让老妇人相当害怕。但是他却用温和轻柔的声音说道：“你想要什么？”	
‘Your master bids you level the hill that stands in front of the sultan’s palace and in its place to make the most beautiful garden in the world.’	“你的主人命令你把苏丹皇宫前面的山夷平，在原来的地方建一座世界上最漂亮的花园。”	
‘Tell my master he shall be obeyed,’ replied Ali; ‘it shall be done this moment.’	“告诉我的主人，我会服从他的，”阿里回答说，“我现在就做这件事。”	
 And the old woman went home and gave Ali’s message to the head.	老妇人就回家了并把阿里的口信带给了人头。	
Meanwhile the sultan was in his palace waiting till the fortieth day should dawn, and wondering that not one spadeful of earth should have been dug out of the hill.	此时苏丹一直在皇宫里等到第四十天的黎明。当时一铲土都还没有从山上挖走，他感到很纳闷。	
‘If that old woman has been playing me a trick,’ thought he, ‘I will hang her!	“假如那个老妇人一直在捉弄我，”他想，“我就把她绞死！	
And I will put up a gallows to-morrow on the hill itself.’	明天我就会在山上搭一座绞刑架。”	
But when to-morrow came there was no hill, and when the sultan opened his eyes he could not imagine why the room was so much lighter than usual, and what was the reason of the sweet smell of flowers that filled the air.	但是当第二天来临时，山已经不在了。当苏丹睁开眼睛时，他无法想象为什么房间比往常更加明亮，为什么空气里充满了花的芳香。	
‘Can there be a fire?’ he said to himself; ‘the sun never came in at this window before.	“是着火了吗？”他对自己说，“阳光从没有从这个窗户照进来过。	
I must get up and see.’	我必须起床看看。”	
 So he rose and looked out, and underneath him flowers from every part of the world were blooming, and creepers of every colour hung in chains from tree to tree.	于是他就起床去看外面，在他的下方，有源自世界各地的花朵正在盛开，各色的匍匐植物相连，悬挂在树与树之间。	　
Then he remembered.	然后他想起来了。	
‘Certainly that old woman’s son is a clever magician!’ cried he; ‘I never met anyone as clever as that.	“那个老妇人的儿子真是一个聪明的魔术师！”他喊道，“我从来没有见过像他一样聪明的人。	
What shall I give him to do next?	接下来我要给什么事情让他做呢？	
Let me think.	让我想想。	
Ah!	啊！	
I know.’	我知道了。”	
 And he sent for the old woman, who by the orders of the head, was waiting below.	于是他就派人去请老妇人，她奉人头的命令正在下面等候着。	
‘Your son has carried out my wishes very nicely,’ he said.	“你的儿子已经很好地实现了我的愿望，”他说，	
‘The garden is larger and better than that of any other king.	“那个花园比其他任何国王的都要更大更好。	
But when I walk across it I shall need some place to rest on the other side.	但是当我穿过花园时，我需要在另一边有一些地方休息。	
In forty days he must build me a palace, in which every room shall be filled with different furniture from a different country, and each more magnificent than any room that ever was seen.’	他必须在四十天内为我建一座宫殿，里面的每一个房间都要装满来自不同国家的不同家具，每一个都要比任何我曾见过的房间更加宏伟。”	
 And having said this he turned round and went away.	他说完就转身离开了。	
‘Oh! he will never be able to do that,’ thought she; ‘it is much more difficult than the hill.’	“噢！他永远无法做到那件事，”她想，“这要比移山困难多了。”	
 And she walked home slowly, with her head bent.	于是她就低着头，缓慢地走了回家。	
‘Well, what am I to do next?’ asked the head cheerfully.	“那么，接下来我要做什么呢？”人头高兴地问道。	
And the old woman told her story.	于是老妇人就讲述了她的经历。	
‘Dear me! is that all? why it is child’s play,’ answered the head; and troubled no more about the palace for thirty-nine days.	“天啊！那就是全部了吗？这简直就是个孩子的游戏。”人头回应说。之后的三十九天里它就再也没有为宫殿烦恼了。	
Then he told the old woman to go to the bridge and call for Hassan.	然后他就告诉老妇人到桥上召唤哈桑。	
‘What do you want, old woman?’ asked Hassan, when he appeared, for he was not as polite as the others had been.	哈桑出现时，并没有像其他人那样礼貌，他只是问：“老妇人，你想要什么？”	
‘Your master commands you to build the most magnificent palace that ever was seen,’ replied she; ‘and you are to place it on the borders of the new garden.’	“你的主人命令你建一座从未见过的最宏伟的宫殿，”她回答说，“你要把它建在新花园的边上。”	
‘He shall be obeyed,’ answered Hassan.	“我会服从他的。”哈桑回答说。	
And when the sultan woke he saw, in the distance, a palace built of soft blue marble, resting on slender pillars of pure gold.	当苏丹醒来时，他看见远处有一座由柔和的蓝色大理石建成的宫殿坐落在纯金的长柱之上。	
‘That old woman’s son is certainly all-powerful,’ cried he; ‘what shall I bid him do now?’	“那个老妇人的儿子真是无所不能啊！”他叫喊道，“我现在应该命令他做什么呢？”	
 And after thinking some time he sent for the old woman, who was expecting the summons.	思考一段时间后，他就派人去请正在期待着传唤的老妇人。	
‘The garden is wonderful, and the palace the finest in the world,’ said he, ‘so fine, that my servants would cut but a sorry figure in it.	“花园很漂亮，宫殿也是世界上最好的，”他说，“这么好以至于宫殿里的仆人显得很丑。	
Let your son fill it with forty slaves whose beauty shall be unequalled, all exactly like each other, and of the same height.’	让你的儿子在里面放四十个无比漂亮的奴隶，长相要完全一样，身高也相同。”	
This time the king thought he had invented something totally impossible, and was quite pleased with himself for his cleverness.	这次国王为自己的聪明感到很高兴，因为他认为他想出了一件完全无法完成的事情。	
Thirty-nine days passed, and at midnight on the night of the last the old woman was standing on the bridge.	三十九天过去了，老妇人在最后一天的午夜站在了桥上。	
‘Bekir!	“贝基尔！	
Bekir!	贝基尔！	
Bekir!’ cried she.	贝基尔！”她叫喊道。	
And a negro appeared, and inquired what she wanted.	于是一个黑人就出现了，并且问她想要什么。	
‘The head, your master, bids you find forty slaves of unequalled beauty, and of the same height, and place them in the sultan’s palace on the other side of the garden.’	“你的人头主人命令你找四十个无比漂亮并且同样高的奴隶，将他们安置在花园另一边苏丹的宫殿中。”	
And when, on the morning of the fortieth day, the sultan went to the blue palace, and was received by the forty slaves, he nearly lost his wits from surprise.	当苏丹第四十天早上去蓝色的宫殿时，他受到了四十个奴仆的欢迎，他惊讶得几乎失去了他的机智。	
‘I will assuredly give my daughter to the old woman’s son,’ thought he.	“我一定会把我的女儿嫁给老妇人的儿子，”他想，	
‘If I were to search all the world through I could never find a more powerful son-in-law.’	“即使我搜寻全世界也永远无法找到一个更强大的女婿。”	
And when the old woman entered his presence he informed her that he was ready to fulfil his promise, and she was to bid her son appear at the palace without delay.	于是当老妇人进入他的宫殿时，他就告知老妇人他准备履行诺言，并且让老妇人命令她的儿子出现在宫殿中，不得延误。	
This command did not at all please the old woman, though, of course, she made no objections to the sultan.	这个命令一点儿也没有让老妇人高兴，虽然，她当然没有反对苏丹。	
‘All has gone well so far,’ she grumbled, when she told her story to the head,’ but what do you suppose the sultan will say, when he sees his daughter’s husband?’	“到目前为止一切都很顺利，”当她把事情告诉给人头时抱怨说，“但是当苏丹看见他女儿的丈夫时，你猜他会说什么？”	
‘Never mind what he says!	“永远不要介意他说什么！	
Put me on a silver dish and carry me to the palace.’	把我放在一个银盘子里，带我去皇宫。”	
So it was done, though the old woman’s heart beat as she laid down the dish with the head upon it.	所以她就这么做了，虽然当她把装有人头的盘子放下时她的心跳得很厉害。	
At the sight before him the king flew into a violent rage.	国王见到眼前的场景，勃然大怒。	
‘I will never marry my daughter to such a monster,’ he cried.	“我永远不会把我的女儿嫁给这样一个怪物。”他吼道。	
But the princess placed her head gently on his arm.	但是公主轻轻地把头偎依在他的胳膊上。	
‘You have given your word, my father, and you cannot break it,’ said she.	“我的父亲，您已经承诺了，您不能食言。”她说。	
‘But, my child, it is impossible for you to marry such a being,’ exclaimed the sultan.	“但是，我的孩子，你绝不能嫁给这样一个东西。”苏丹叫喊道。	
‘Yes, I will marry him.	“不，我会嫁给他的。	
He had a beautiful head, and I love him already.’	他的头很美，我已经爱上他了。”	
So the marriage was celebrated, and great feasts were held in the palace, though the people wept tears to think of the sad fate of their beloved princess.	于是婚礼就举行了，皇宫里举办了盛宴，虽然人们想到他们心爱的公主的悲惨命运就要流泪。	
But when the merry-making was done, and the young couple were alone, the head suddenly disappeared, or, rather, a body was added to it, and one of the handsomest young men that ever was seen stood before the princess.	但是当狂欢过后小两口独处的时候，人头突然消失了，或者更确切地说，是增加了一个身体，一个未曾见过的最英俊的年轻人站在了公主面前。	
‘A wicked fairy enchanted me at my birth,’ he said, ‘and for the rest of the world I must always be a head only.	“一个邪恶的妖精在我出生的时候给我施了魔法，”他说，“我在世界其他任何地方都必须只能是一个头。	
But for you, and you only, I am a man like other men.’	但是，对你，只有对你，我才会像其他男人一样。”	
‘And that is all I care about,’ said the princess.	“那就是我所关心的全部。”公主说。
