"书名皮维和卡博（安德鲁•朗格经典童话故事）短简介一正一邪，贪婪邪恶注定不得善终。皮维是正义的代表，卡博是邪恶的代表，他非常贪婪，出卖朋友，这也为他的下场埋下了伏笔。长简介安德鲁•朗格整理的童话故事《皮维和卡博》给我们讲述了卡博因背叛朋友而致使下场可悲的故事。自私与贪婪的个性让卡博走进了一条深渊，他背叛自己的好朋友皮维，并因妒忌而对他加以陷害，还将皮维的妻子占为己有。不过善有善报，恶有恶报，最终卡博还是死在了皮维的手上。整个故事简洁易懂，揭露人性的丑恶以及“善有善报，恶有恶报”亘古不变的真理。关键字皮维和卡博；安德鲁•朗格；外研社编译组；棕色童话；自私；贪婪作者（英）安德鲁·朗格作者简介安德鲁·朗格（1844—1912），英国著名的文学家、历史学家、诗人、民俗学家，以研究神话、民间传说闻名于世，由他编纂并分别以十二种颜色命名的“世界童话集”自1898年问世以来，历久不衰，备受世界各国儿童们的喜爱。书评“如果孩子们的世界里没有那神奇美丽的童话，他们的生活将不可想象；如果这座童话乐园里没有安德鲁•朗格所编写的童话，他们的童心就得不到完美的塑造”。 ——一位西方教育家"
"Pivi and Kabo","皮维和卡博"
"by Andrew Lang","作者：安德鲁·朗格"
"When birds were men, and men were birds, Pivi and Kabo lived in an island far away, called New Claledonia.","很久以前，那还是人鸟不分的时代。皮维和卡博住在一个遥远的岛上，那个岛叫克莱勒得尼亚。"
"Pivi was a cheery little bird that chirps at sunset; Kabo was an ugly black fowl that croaks in the darkness.","皮维是一只欢乐的小鸟，他在日落时分欢唱；卡博是一只丑陋的黑鸟，他总在夜里发出嘶哑的声音。"
"One day Pivi and Kabo thought that they would make slings, and practice slinging, as the people of the island still do.","一天，皮维和卡博心血来潮，要做投石器并练习投石，正如岛上的人们仍然做的那样。"
"So they went to a banyan tree, and stripped the bark to make strings for their slings, and next they repaired to the river bank to find stones.","于是他们来到一棵榕树前，剥下树皮为他们的投石器做绳子，接下来又去河边找石头。"
"Kabo stood on the bank of the river, and Pivi went into the water.","卡博站在岸边，而皮维则走到河里。"
"The game was for Kabo to sling at Pivi, and for Pivi to dodge the stones, if he could.","这个游戏就是卡博朝皮维投石，皮维则要尽可能躲过石头。"
"For some time he dodged them cleverly, but at last a stone from Kabo’s sling hit poor Pivi on the leg and broke it.","有一段时间，皮维巧妙地躲过石头，但最后可怜的皮维被卡博投来的石头击中了腿并受了伤。"
"Down went Pivi into the stream, and floated along it, till he floated into a big hollow bamboo, which a woman used for washing her sweet potatoes.","皮维倒在河流里，顺流而下。最后他漂进一个大竹筒里，这个竹筒是一个妇人用来洗番茄的。"
"‘What is that in my bamboo?’ said the woman.","“我的竹筒里是什么？”那个妇人说道。"
"And she blew in at one end, and blew little Pivi out at the other, like a pea from a pea-shooter.","于是她吹了吹竹筒的一头。小皮维从另一头被吹出来，就像一颗豌豆从射豆枪里射出来一样。"
"‘Oh!’ cried the woman, ‘what a state you are in!","“啊！”妇人惊呼道，“你的情况真是糟糕！"
"What have you been doing?’","你都做了些什么？”"
"‘It was Kabo who broke my leg at the slinging game,’ said Pivi.","“在投石游戏中，卡博弄伤了我的腿。”皮维说道。"
"‘Well, I am sorry for you,’ said the woman; ‘will you come with me, and do what I tell you?’","“噢，我真为你难过。”妇人说，“你愿意跟我走，并照我的吩咐做吗？”"
"‘I will!’ said Pivi, for the woman was very kind and pretty.","“我愿意！”皮维答道。他觉得妇人非常善良和美丽。"
"She took Pivi into a shed where she kept her fruit laid him on a bed of mats, and made him as comfortable as she could, and attended to his broken leg without cutting off the flesh round the bone, as these people usually do.","妇人把皮维带到她用来放水果的棚子里面，让他躺在铺着垫子的床上，尽可能让他舒服。在护理皮维受伤的腿时，妇女并有像常人经常做的那样切掉骨头周边的肉。"
"‘You will be still, won’t you, Pivi?’ she said.","“你会安静地呆着，对吧，皮维？”她说，"
"‘If you hear a little noise you will pretend to be dead.","“如果你听到小动静就要装死。"
"It is the Black Ant who will come and creep from your feet up to your head.","那是黑蚁来了。他会从你的腿上爬到你的头上。"
"Say nothing, and keep quiet, won’t you, Pivi?’","这时什么都不要讲，保持安静，可以吗，皮维？”"
"‘Certainly, kind lady,’ said Pivi, ‘I will lie as still as can be.’","“当然可以，善良的女士，”皮维说，“我会尽量躺着不动。”"
"‘Next will come the big Red Ant—you know him?’","“接下来要来的是大红蚁，你知道他吗？”"
"‘Yes, I know him, with his feet like a grasshopper’s.’","“是的，我知道他。他有像蝗虫一样的脚。”"
"‘He will walk over your body up to your head.","“他会走过你的身体直到你的头部。"
"Then you must shake all your body.","这时你必须晃动你的全身。"
"Do you understand, Pivi?’","明白了吗，皮维？”"
"‘Yes, dear lady, I shall do just as you say.’","“是的，女士，我会照你说的去做。”"
"‘Very good,’ said the woman, going out and shutting the door.","“很好。”妇女说完，走了出去，同时将门带上。"
"Pivi lay still under his coverings, then a tiny noise was heard, and the Black Ant began to march over Pivi, who lay quite still.","皮维身上盖着东西，一动不动地躺在床上。过了一会儿他听到细小的声音，然后黑蚁爬过了一动不动的皮维。"
"Then came the big Red Ant skipping along his body, and then Pivi shook himself all over.","接着大红蚁爬过他的身体，这时皮维拼命晃动自己的身体。"
"He jumped up quite well again, he ran to the river, he looked into the water and saw that he was changed from a bird into a fine young man!","他又可以健康地跳起来了。他跑到了河边，朝水里一看，发现自己由一只鸟变成了一个帅气的年轻人。"
"‘Oh, lady,’ he cried, ‘look at me now!","“啊，女士！”他惊呼道，“你看看我！"
"I am changed into a man, and so handsome!’","我变成了一个人，还如此英俊！”"
"‘Will you obey me again?’ said the woman.","“你愿意再次服从我吗？”妇人问。"
"‘Always; whatever you command I will do it,’ said Pivi, politely.","“一直都愿意。我会做你要求的任何事。”皮维礼貌地回答。"
"‘Then climb up that cocoa-nut tree, with your legs only, not using your hands,’ said the woman.","“那你就爬上那棵椰子树，只能用你的双腿，不能用你的双手。”妇人说道。"
"Now the natives can run up cocoa-nut trees like squirrels, some using only one hand; the girls can do that.","当时，当地人可以像松鼠一样爬上椰树，他们中的一些人甚至只用一只手便可做到；女孩子也可以那样做。"
"But few can climb without using their hands at all.","但是还没有人可以做到完全不用手爬上树。"
"‘At the top of the tree you will find two cocoa-nuts.","“在树的顶端，你会发现两个椰子。"
"You must not throw them down, but carry them in your hands; and you must descend as you went up, using your legs only.’","别往下扔，用手拿着它们下来，下来的时候也只能用脚往下滑。”"
"‘I shall try, at least,’ said Pivi.","“至少我会尝试一下。”皮维说。"
"And up he went, but it was very difficult, and down he came.","说完他就爬上去了，但是非常吃力，接着他又从树上下来。"
"‘Here are your cocoa-nuts,’ he said, presenting them to the woman.","“这是你要的椰子。”他边说边把椰子给妇人。"
"‘Now, Pivi, put them in the shed where you lay, and when the sun sets to cool himself in the sea and rise again not so hot in the dawn you must go and take the nuts.’","“现在，皮维，你把椰子放进你刚才躺过的那个棚子里。当太阳浸到海里享受清凉，然后又在黎明时分升起来时，此时不太热，你必须去棚子里取椰子。”"
"All day Pivi played about in the river, as the natives do, throwing fruit and silvery showers of water at each other.","一整天皮维都在河边玩，就像当地人那样，他跟大家互相扔水果，互相泼银色的水。"
"When the sun set he went into the hut.","当太阳下山时，他去了那间房子。"
"But as he drew near he heard sweet voices talking and laughing within.","但当他靠近时，他听到里面传出甜美的谈话声和银铃般的笑声。"
"‘What is that?","“那是什么？"
"People chattering in the hut!","有人在屋子里谈话！"
"Perhaps they have taken my cocoa-nuts,’ said Pivi to himself.","也许他们已经拿走了我的椰子。”皮维自言自语道。"
"In he went, and there he found two pretty, laughing, teasing girls.","他走到里面，发现里面有两个漂亮爱笑的姑娘。"
"He hunted for his cocoanuts, but none were there.","他到处找他的椰子，但是没有找到。"
"Down he ran to the river.","于是他跑回到河边。"
"‘Oh, lady, my nuts have been stolen!’ he cried.","“啊，女士，我的椰子被偷了！”他喊道。"
"‘Come with me, Pivi, and there will be nuts for you,’ said the woman.","“跟我来，皮维，少不了你的椰子。”妇人说道。"
"They went back to the hut, where the girls were laughing and playing.","他们回到棚子里，两个女孩还在边笑边玩。"
"‘Nuts for you?’ said the woman, ‘there are two wives for you, Pivi, take them to your house.’","“你的椰子？”妇人说，“这里有你的两位妻子，皮维。带她们到你的房间里去。”"
"‘Oh, good lady,’ cried Pivi, ‘how kind you are!’","“啊，好女士！”皮维喊着，“你太善良了！”"
"So they were married and very happy, when in came cross old Kabo.","然后他们结婚了，而且非常幸福，直到他们碰到卡博。"
"‘Is this Pivi?’ said he.","“这是皮维吗？”卡博说道，"
"‘Yes, it is—no, it isn’t.","“一定是，不对，不是。"
"It is not the same Pivi—but there is a kind of likeness.","这不是我认识的皮维，但是有一点儿相像。"
"Tell me, are you Pivi?’","告诉我，你是皮维吗？”"
"‘Oh, yes!’ said Pivi.","“啊，是的！”皮维说，"
"‘But I am much better looking, and there are my two wives, are they not beautiful?’","“而且我变得更好看了。这是我的两位妻子，她们是不是很漂亮？”"
"‘You are mocking me, Pivi!","“你开玩笑吧，皮维！"
"Your wives?","你的妻子？"
"How?","怎么回事？"
"Where did you get them?","你从哪里得到她们的？"
"You, with wives!’","你，还有你的妻子！”"
"Then Pivi told Kabo about the kind woman, and all the wonderful things that had happened to him.","然后皮维就告诉了卡博关于那个善良的妇人和发生在自己身上的所有美好的一切。"
"‘Well, well!’ said Kabo, ‘but I want to be handsome too, and to have pretty young wives.’","“真好，真好，”卡博说，“我也想变得帅气，想有漂亮的妻子。”"
"‘But how can we manage that?’ asked Pivi.","“但是我们怎么才能做到呢？”皮维问道。"
"‘Oh, we shall do all the same things over again—play at slinging, and, this time, you shall break my leg, Pivi!’","“哦，我们应该把相同的事情再做一遍——投石游戏。而且这一次你要弄伤我的腿，皮维！”"
"‘With all the pleasure in life,’ said Pivi, who was always ready to oblige.","“当然可以！”皮维对卡博向来言听计从。"
"So they went slinging, and Pivi broke Kabo’s leg, and Kabo fell into the river, and floated into the bamboo, and the woman blew him out, just as before.","于是他们又去玩投石游戏，皮维打断了卡博的腿。卡博倒在河里，顺流漂进了大竹筒，少妇同样把它吹了出来。"
"Then she picked up Kabo, and put him in the shed, and told him what to do when the Black Ant came, and what to do when the Red Ant came.","妇人捡起卡博，把他放进小棚子里，并且告诉他，当黑蚁来时怎么做，红蚁来时又怎么做。"
"But he didn’t!","但是卡博并没有照做。"
"When the Black Ant came, he shook himself, and behold, he had a twisted leg, and a hump back, and was as black as the ant.","黑蚂蚁刚爬到身上，他就迫不及待地乱晃。看！他也变了，变得瘸腿驼背，黑如蚂蚁。"
"Then he ran to the woman.","然后他跑去找那个妇人。"
"‘Look, what a figure I am!’ he said; but she only told him to climb the tree, as she had told Pivi.","“看，我这样子多难看啊！”妇人并不理睬，只是让他照皮维的样子爬树。"
"But Kabo climbed with both hands and feet, and he threw down the nuts, instead of carrying them down, and he put them in the hut.","可是，卡博爬起树来手脚并用，两个椰子也没用手拿下来，而是直接扔到了地上。然后他把椰子放进棚子里。"
"And when he went back for them there he found two horrid old black hags, wrangling, and scolding, and scratching!","当他回来取的时候，他发现两个又黑又可怕的老太婆在里面争吵谩骂，打成一团。"
"So back he went to Pivi with his two beautiful wives, and Pivi was very sorry, but what could he do?","就这样卡博回去见皮维和他的两个漂亮妻子。皮维很过意不去，但是他又能做什么呢？"
"Nothing, but sit and cry.","什么都做不了，只能陪他坐着掉泪。"
"So, one day, Kabo came and asked Pivi to sail in his canoe to a place where he knew of a great big shell-fish, enough to feed on for a week.","一天，卡博来找皮维，邀他乘他的独木舟出海，说自己发现了一只大牡蛎，足够让他们吃一个星期。"
"Pivi went, and deep in the clear water they saw a monstrous shell-fish, like an oyster, as big as a rock, with the shell wide open.","皮维去了，他们看到在清澈的水深处有一个巨大的贝壳，像一只牡蛎，但个头像座小山包，张着两片壳。"
"‘We shall catch it, and dry it, and kipper it,’ said Pivi, ‘and give a dinner to all our friends!’","“我们应该抓住它，把它晒干腌好，”皮维说，“然后请我们所有的朋友一起吃一顿大餐。”"
"‘I shall dive for it, and break it off the rock,’ said Kabo, ‘and then you must help me to drag it up into the canoe.’","“我潜水过去，先把它从石缝里拖出来，”卡博说，“然后你必须帮助我把它拖到船上。”"
"There the shell-fish lay and gaped, but Kabo, though he dived in, kept well out of the way of the beast.","贝壳仍张着大嘴躺在那里，一动不动。卡博潜到水里，只在怪物周围转，根本不敢凑过去。"
"Up he came, puffing and blowing: ‘Oh, Pivi,’ he cried, ‘I cannot move it.","不一会儿，他浮出水面，气喘吁吁地喊：“喂，皮维，我弄不动它。"
"Jump in and try yourself!’","要不你跳下去试试？”"
"Pivi dived, with his spear, and the shell-fish opened its shell wider yet, and sucked, and Pivi disappeared into its mouth, and the shell shut up with a snap!","皮维带着自己的长矛潜入水中，刚游到跟前，贝壳突然张大双壳，用力一吸，皮维便消失在它的嘴里，然后它啪的一声合上了壳。"
"Kabo laughed like a fiend, and then went home.","卡博一阵狞笑，径直回到皮维家里。"
"‘Where is Pivi?’ asked the two pretty girls.","“皮维在哪里？”两个漂亮的姑娘问道。"
"Kabo pretended to cry, and told how Pivi had been swallowed.","卡博假装哭泣，接着告诉她们皮维被吞的经过。"
"‘But dry your tears, my darlings,’ said Kabo, ‘I will be your husband, and my wives shall be your slaves.","“擦干你们的眼泪，我的宝贝，”卡博说，“我来做你们的丈夫，我的妻子可以做你们的奴隶。"
"Everything is for the best, in the best of all possible worlds.’","这样的安排再好不过了，我可是一片好心。”"
"‘No, no!’ cried the girls, ‘we love Pivi.","“不，不！”女孩哭着说，“我们爱皮维。"
"We do not love anyone else.","我们不会爱上其他任何人了。"
"We shall stay at home, and weep for Pivi!’","我们要留在家里为皮维哭泣，哪儿也不去！”"
"‘Wretched idiots!’ cried Kabo; ‘Pivi was a scoundrel who broke my leg, and knocked me into the river.’","“可怜的傻瓜！”卡博吼道，“皮维是一个无赖，他打断了我的腿，还把我踹进了河里。”"
"Then a little cough was heard at the door, and Kabo trembled, for he knew it was the cough of Pivi!","这时门口处传来一声轻轻的咳嗽。卡博哆嗦起来，因为他知道那是皮维的咳嗽声！"
"‘Ah, dear Pivi!’ cried Kabo, rushing to the door.","“哎哟，亲爱的皮维！”卡博叫道，连忙跑到门口，"
"‘What joy!","“太让人高兴了！"
"I was trying to console your dear wives.’","我刚才正努力安慰你心爱的妻子呢。”"
"Pivi said not one word.","皮维二话没说。"
"He waved his hand, and five and twenty of his friends came trooping down the hill.","他挥了挥手，然后他的二十五个朋友冲下了山。"
"They cut up Kabo into little pieces.","他们把卡博剁成了小碎片。"
"Pivi turned round, and there was the good woman of the river.","皮维转过身，他看到河边那善良的妇人。"
"‘Pivi,’ she said, ‘how did you get out of the living tomb into which Kabo sent you?’","“皮维，”她问，“你是怎么逃出卡博专门为你准备的那口棺材的？”"
"‘I had my spear with me,’ said Pivi.","“我带了长矛，”皮维说，"
"‘It was quite dry inside the shell, and I worked away at the fish with my spear, till he saw reason to open his shell, and out I came.’","“贝壳里面很干燥，我就不停地用我的矛刺它，直到它肯张开它的壳。然后我就出来了。”"
" Then the good woman laughed; and Pivi and his two wives lived happy ever afterwards.","听罢，那个善良的妇人笑了。从此以后，皮维和他的两个妻子过上了幸福的生活。"
