"How I Edited An Agricultural Paper","我是如何编辑农业报的"
"by Mark Twain","作者：马克·吐温"
"I did not take temporary editorship of an agricultural paper without misgivings.","我接下这份农业报临时编辑的工作并不是毫无顾虑的。"
"Neither would a landsman take command of a ship without misgivings.","就像一个已经习惯在陆地上生活的人是不可能毫无顾忌地去驾驶船只那样。"
"But I was in circumstances that made the salary an object.","但是，当时我的生活实在太过窘迫，以至于我把工资当成我的追求。"
"The regular editor of the paper was going off for a holiday, and I accepted the terms he offered, and took his place.","所以，当他们的正式编辑要外出去度假的时候，我便接受了他提供的所有条件，代替了他。"
"The sensation of being at work again was luxurious, and I wrought all the week with unflagging pleasure.","这种重返工作岗位的感觉十分舒服，我怀着愉悦的心情，扎扎实实、勤勤恳恳地工作了一个星期。"
"We went to press, and I waited a day with some solicitude to see whether my effort was going to attract any notice.","稿件付印了，我怀着焦虑的心情等了一整天，希望自己的努力能够引起大家的注意。"
"As I left the office, toward sundown, a group of men and boys at the foot of the stairs dispersed with one impulse, and gave me passageway, and I heard one or two of them say: “That’s him!”","日落时分，我走出办公室的时候，发现在楼梯底下有一大群大人和孩子，他们主动地向两边散开，让出了一条道。同时，我还听到他们中的一两个人小声嘀咕着：“就是他！”"
"I was naturally pleased by this incident.","这个小意外自然令我很高兴。"
"The next morning I found a similar group at the foot of the stairs, and scattering couples and individuals standing here and there in the street and over the way, watching me with interest.","第二天早上，我又在楼梯底下发现了类似的一群人，还有一些人三三两两站在街对面，饶有兴趣地看着我。"
"The group separated and fell back as I approached, and I heard a man say, “Look at his eye!”","当我走近的时候，那群人又像昨天那样向两边散开。同时，我听到有人说：“看他的眼睛！”"
"I pretended not to observe the notice I was attracting, but secretly I was pleased with it, and was purposing to write an account of it to my aunt.","我假装没有察觉到自己所引起的注意，但是心里还是十分得意。而且，我还准备写一封信给我的姨妈来说说这件事。"
"I went up the short flight of stairs, and heard cheery voices and a ringing laugh as I drew near the door, which I opened, and caught a glimpse of two young rural-looking men, whose faces blanched and lengthened when they saw me, and then they both plunged through the window with a great crash.","我爬上那一小段楼梯，走向自己的办公室，在我开门的时候，还听到人们欢快的交谈声和清脆的笑声。我一开门，就瞥见两个乡下打扮的年轻男人，他们看见我时，脸色苍白、脸拉得很长，紧接着两人便砰的一声从窗口冲了出去。"
"I was surprised.","我感到十分惊讶。"
"In about half an hour an old gentleman, with a flowing beard and a fine but rather austere face, entered, and sat down at my invitation.","大约过了一个半小时，一个留着长须、面色红润但表情异常严肃的老人走了进来，我请他坐了下来。"
"He seemed to have something on his mind.","他看起来仿佛想要说些什么。"
"He took off his hat and set it on the floor, and got out of it a red silk handkerchief and a copy of our paper.","他摘下帽子，放在地板上，然后从帽子里取出一条红色丝绸手帕和一份我们的报纸。"
"He put the paper on his lap, and while he polished his spectacles with his handkerchief he said, “Are you the new editor?”","他把报纸放在膝盖上，一边用手帕擦着眼镜一边说：“你就是那个新来的编辑？”"
"I said I was.","“是的。”我答道。"
"“Have you ever edited an agricultural paper before?”","“你之前有没有编辑过农业报纸？”"
"“No,” I said; “this is my first attempt.”","“没有，”我说，“这是我首次尝试编辑农业报。”"
"“Very likely.","“想必也是。"
"Have you had any experience in agriculture practically?”","那你之前有过一些农业方面的经验吗？”"
"“No; I believe I have not.”","“没有，我想没有。”"
"“Some instinct told me so,” said the old gentleman, putting on his spectacles, and looking over them at me with asperity, while he folded his paper into a convenient shape.","老人戴上他的眼镜，一边将报纸折成便于携带的形状，一边透过镜片用一种刻薄的眼神盯着我说：“我的直觉告诉我事情就是这样。"
"“I wish to read you what must have made me have that instinct.","我希望能给你读一读这段让我产生这种直觉的文字。"
"It was this editorial.","就是这段社评。"
"Listen, and see if it was you that wrote it:","听好了，听听这到底是不是你写的："
"“‘Turnips should never be pulled, it injures them.","‘萝卜不应该用手拔下来，这样做会损害到萝卜。"
"It is much better to send a boy up and let him shake the tree.’","如果我们能让一个小孩爬上萝卜树，把它们摇下来，那样会好很多。’"
"“Now, what do you think of that? for I really suppose you wrote it?”","“好了，你对这段话怎么看？我想这确实是你写的吧？”"
"“Think of it?","“我怎么看？"
"Why, I think it is good.","为什么要这么问？我觉得这写得很好。"
"I think it is sense.","讲得很有道理。"
"I have no doubt that every year millions and millions of bushels of turnips are spoiled in this township alone by being pulled in a half-ripe condition, when, if they had sent a boy up to shake the tree—”","我确信每年在这个镇上，单单是为了拔出那些半熟的萝卜就要糟蹋成千上万蒲式耳的萝卜。所以，如果你能让一个小男孩爬上去把它们摇下来的话——”"
"“Shake your grandmother!","“摇你奶奶个头啊！"
"Turnips don’t grow on trees!”","萝卜根本就不长在树上！”"
"“Oh, they don’t, don’t they?","“什么！不长在树上？难道不是这样的么？"
"Well, who said they did?","好吧，谁说它们是长在树上的。"
"The language was intended to be figurative, wholly figurative.","我那句话只是打个比喻，完全的比喻性质。"
"Anybody that knows anything will know that I meant that the boy should shake the vine.”","稍微有点儿常识的人都知道，我指的是叫小孩子去摇萝卜的藤。”"
"Then this old person got up and tore his paper all into small shreds, and stamped on them, and broke several things with his cane, and said I did not know as much as a cow; and then went—out and banged the door after him, and, in short, acted in such a way that I fancied he was displeased about something.","那个老头猛地站了起来，将那份报纸撕得粉碎，在上面狠狠地跺了几脚。之后，他还举起拐杖打破了一些东西，痛斥我还不如一头奶牛懂得多。然后砰的一声把门甩上，出去了。总之，我认为他这么做只是因为对什么事感到不满。"
"But not knowing what the trouble was, I could not be any help to him.","可是我也不知道他究竟对什么事如此不满，所以我也帮不了他。"
"Pretty soon after this a long, cadaverous creature, with lanky locks hanging down to his shoulders, and a week’s stubble bristling from the hills and valleys of his face, darted within the door, and halted, motionless, with finger on lip, and head and body bent in listening attitude.","没过多久，一个个子很高、形容枯槁、几缕长发垂在肩上、坑坑洼洼的脸上长着浓密的胡子茬儿的家伙冲了进来。他一动也不动，将手指放在嘴唇上，埋头弯腰，仿佛在听些什么。"
"No sound was heard.","可是，他什么声音也没听到。"
"Still he listened.","但是他还在听。"
"No sound.","仍然是没有任何声音。"
"Then he turned the key in the door, and came elaborately tiptoeing toward me till he was within long reaching distance of me, when he stopped and, after scanning my face with intense interest for a while, drew a folded copy of our paper from his bosom, and said:","然后，他锁上门，小心翼翼地踮着脚走向我，却走到离我还有好远的地方就停住了。他饶有兴致地扫视我的脸，从怀中掏出一份折叠起来的我们的报纸，摊开来，说道："
"“There, you wrote that.","“是你！就是你写的这个！"
"Read it to me—quick!","读给我听！快点儿！"
"Relieve me.","让我解脱吧。"
"I suffer.”","我太难受了。”"
"I read as follows; and as the sentences fell from my lips I could see the relief come, I could see the drawn muscles relax, and the anxiety go out of the face, and rest and peace steal over the features like the merciful moonlight over a desolate landscape:","于是，我开始读下面的这段文章。伴随着我读报纸的声音，我可以清楚地看到他紧张的肌肉放松下来了，脸上的焦虑也渐渐消失，取而代之的是安静平和的神情，仿佛是柔和的月光洒在荒芜的大地上："
"The guano is a fine bird, but great care is necessary in rearing it.","海鸟粪是一种很好的鸟，但是饲养它需要特别精心的呵护。"
"It should not be imported earlier than June or later than September.","引进的时间不能在六月以前，也不能在九月以后。"
"In the winter it should be kept in a warm place, where it can hatch out its young.","冬天，应该把它养在温暖的地方，那里有利于它们孵化幼崽。"
"It is evident that we are to have a backward season for grain.","很明显，今年我们谷物的收成时间会推迟。"
"Therefore it will be well for the farmer to begin setting out his corn-stalks and planting his buckwheat cakes in July instead of August.","因此，农民们最好是在七月而不是八月开始插上玉米秆以及种植荞麦饼。"
"Concerning the pumpkin.","至于南瓜。"
"This berry is a favorite with the natives of the interior of New England, who prefer it to the gooseberry for the making of fruit-cake, and who likewise give it the preference over the raspberry for feeding cows, as being more filling and fully as satisfying.","南瓜这种浆果是新英格兰内地居民最喜爱的食品。他们觉得拿它们来做水果饼比醋栗子强。同时，他们也认为相比覆盆子，用南瓜喂牛更好，因为南瓜更容易饱腹，而且牛也更爱吃。"
"The pumpkin is the only esculent of the orange family that will thrive in the North, except the gourd and one or two varieties of the squash.","除了葫芦和一两种变种的笋瓜之外，南瓜是唯一一种能够在北方大量种植的、可食用的柑橘类蔬菜。"
"But the custom of planting it in the front yard with the shrubbery is fast going out of vogue, for it is now generally conceded that, the pumpkin as a shade tree is a failure.","但把它和灌木一起种在前院里的做法也越来越不时兴了，因为大家认为用南瓜树遮阴的办法是错误的。"
"Now, as the warm weather approaches, and the ganders begin to spawn—","现在天气转暖了，公鹅也开始下蛋了——"
"The excited listener sprang toward me to shake hands, and said:","这时，那个听得兴奋的男人向我跑过来，握手说道："
"“There, there—that will do.","“好了，这里，就到这里！"
"I know I am all right now, because you have read it just as I did, word, for word.","我知道我现在很好，因为你读的跟我看到的完全一模一样，一字不差。"
"But, stranger, when I first read it this morning, I said to myself, I never, never believed it before, notwithstanding my friends kept me under watch so strict, but now I believe I am crazy; and with that I fetched a howl that you might have heard two miles, and started out to kill somebody—because, you know, I knew it would come to that sooner or later, and so I might as well begin.","可是，先生，在今天早上我第一次读这篇文章的时候，我告诉我自己，虽然我的朋友把我看得很严，但是之前我绝对不相信我疯了，不过现在我可以确信我是真的疯了。于是我嚎叫一声——那声音在两里外都听得见——之后我便开始杀人，因为我知道这件事迟早都要发生，所以我还不如现在就行动。"
"I read one of them paragraphs over again, so as to be certain, and then I burned my house down and started.","为了证明我确实是疯了，我又读了一遍其中的一段，然后我放火烧了自己的房子，开始行动起来。"
"I have crippled several people, and have got one fellow up a tree, where I can get him if I want him.","我先打残了几个人，还把一个家伙弄到了树上，等我想要修理他的时候，我可以把他弄下来。"
"But I thought I would call in here as I passed along and make the thing perfectly certain; and now it is certain, and I tell you it is lucky for the chap that is in the tree.","可是当我走到这里来的时候，我觉得我还是来当面确认一下会比较好。现在事情已经弄清楚了，我告诉你，刚刚被我弄上树的那个家伙真是走运。"
"I should have killed him sure, as I went back.","要不然我回去肯定会杀了他。"
"Good-by, sir, good-by; you have taken a great load off my mind.","再见了，先生！再见！你真是帮我卸下了一个很大的思想包袱。"
"My reason has stood the strain of one of your agricultural articles, and I know that nothing can ever unseat it now.","我的理性居然可以忍受住你那些农业报道，而且我知道，现在已经没有什么能改变它的位置了。"
"Good-by, sir.”","再见！”"
"I felt a little uncomfortable about the cripplings and arsons this person had been entertaining himself with, for I could not help feeling remotely accessory to them.","这个男人为了使自己开心而杀人放火，对于这种行为，我感到非常不安，因为我总是忍不住想到我与这两件事有着千丝万缕的关系，仿佛我是他的帮凶一样。"
"But these thoughts were quickly banished, for the regular editor walked in!","但是，这种想法很快就从我的脑海中消失了，因为正式编辑进来了！"
"[I thought to myself, Now if you had gone to Egypt as I recommended you to, I might have had a chance to get my hand in; but you wouldn’t do it, and here you are.","（我心想，如果你听了我的建议去了埃及的话，那我还有机会大显身手。可是你偏不听我的，现在就回来了。"
"I sort of expected you.]","奇怪的是，我倒有点儿期待他的出现。）"
"The editor was looking sad and perplexed and dejected.","编辑看起来非常伤心，又困惑，又沮丧。"
"He surveyed the wreck which that old rioter and those two young farmers had made, and then said “This is a sad business—a very sad business.","他看了看地上被那个老暴徒和那两个年轻农夫打碎的东西之后对我说：“这真是见令人伤心的事——非常令人伤心。"
"There is the mucilage-bottle broken, and six panes of glass, and a spittoon, and two candlesticks.","胶水瓶被打破了，还有六块玻璃、一个痰盂和两支烛台。"
"But that is not the worst.","但是这还不是最坏的情况。"
"The reputation of the paper is injured—and permanently, I fear.","我们这份报纸的声誉都被你毁了，恐怕可以说是永久地被毁掉了！"
"True, there never was such a call for the paper before, and it never sold such a large edition or soared to such celebrity; but does one want to be famous for lunacy, and prosper upon the infirmities of his mind?","对！之前这份报纸从来没有像现在这么受欢迎，从来没有卖出过像现在这么多份，从来没有像现在这样声名在外。但是，你想想有谁愿意靠精神错乱出名，靠装神经病来发达？"
"My friend, as I am an honest man, the street out here is full of people, and others are roosting on the fences, waiting to get a glimpse of you, because they think you are crazy.","我的朋友，我老实告诉你，现在街对面全是人，还有一些人坐在栅栏上，他们等在那里只是为了能看你一眼，因为在读了你的文章之后，他们都觉得你是个疯子！"
"And well they might after reading your editorials.","或许他们还会追读你的文章。"
"They are a disgrace to journalism.","可是，你编的那些东西简直是整个新闻界的耻辱。"
"Why, what put it into your head that you could edit a paper of this nature?","为什么你会编出这样的报纸？你脑袋里到底装了什么？"
"You do not seem to know the first rudiments of agriculture.","你好像连最基本的农业知识都不知道。"
"You speak of a furrow and a harrow as being the same thing; you talk of the moulting season for cows; and you recommend the domestication of the pole-cat on account of its playfulness and its excellence as a ratter!","在你口中，犁沟和犁耙居然是同一个东西；你还说什么牛脱皮的季节；你还劝人养鸡貂，说它们很滑稽而且很会捕鼠；"
"Your remark that clams will lie quiet if music be played to them was superfluous—entirely superfluous.","你还说只要给蛤蜊听音乐，它就可以安静地呆着不动，这完全是废话——完全是多此一举！"
"Nothing disturbs clams.","根本没有什么东西能够惊动蛤蜊。"
"Clams always lie quiet.","它们总是呆着不动。"
"Clams care nothing whatever about music.","蛤蜊才不管在它周围的是什么，管他是音乐还是其他！"
"Ah, heavens and earth, friend! if you had made the acquiring of ignorance the study of your life, you could not have graduated with higher honor than you could to-day.","啊，天呐，我的朋友！如果你把愚昧无知作为你的终生事业，你可能到毕业的时候也不会拿到比现在更高的荣誉了。"
"I never saw anything like it.","我从来没有见过这样的事情。"
"Your observation that the horse-chestnut as an article of commerce is steadily gaining in favor is simply calculated to destroy this journal.","你关于用七叶树做商品会越来越流行的报道，简直就是要毁了这份报纸。"
"I want you to throw up your situation and go.","我要你立刻马上离开你的位子，立马滚蛋！"
"I want no more holiday—I could not enjoy it if I had it.","我再也不要休假了——即使休假我也不可能安心。"
"Certainly not with you in my chair.","让你在这里代替我的职位，我当然无法安心休假。"
"I would always stand in dread of what you might be going to recommend next.","我还要时不时地担心，你还会搞出什么名堂来。"
"It makes me lose all patience every time I think of your discussing oyster-beds under the head of ‘Landscape Gardening.’","每当我想起你在‘庭院设计’专栏里讨论牡蛎饲养的问题时，我就不禁火冒三丈。"
"I want you to go.","我现在就要你滚！"
"Nothing on earth could persuade me to take another holiday.","无论发生什么，我都不会再去休假了。"
"Oh! why didn’t you tell me you didn’t know anything about agriculture?”","你为什么不先告诉我你对农业一无所知呢？”"
"“Tell you, you corn-stalk, you cabbage, you son of a cauliflower?","“告诉你？你这个玉米秆，你这个卷心菜，你这个花椰菜崽！"
"It’s the first time I ever heard such an unfeeling remark.","我还是头一次听到这种无情无义的话。"
"I tell you I have been in the editorial business going on fourteen years, and it is the first time I ever heard of a man’s having to know anything in order to edit a newspaper.","我跟你讲，我已经在编辑这个行业摸爬滚打了14年，这还是头一次有人告诉我编辑报纸还要什么专业知识。"
"You turnip!","你这个萝卜！"
"Who write the dramatic critiques for the second-rate papers?","你知道是谁在给那些二流的报纸写剧评？"
"Why, a parcel of promoted shoemakers and apprentice apothecaries, who know just as much about good acting as I do about good farming and no more.","不就是一些高级鞋匠和药师学徒么？他们对演戏的知识不见得有我对农业的了解多。"
"Who review the books?","是谁在写那些书评？"
"People who never wrote one.","就是那些从来都没有出过书的人。"
"Who do up the heavy leaders on finance?","是谁在写那些关于财政的冗长社论呢？"
"Parties who have had the largest opportunities for knowing nothing about it.","恰恰就是那些对财政一无所知的人。"
"Who criticize the Indian campaigns?","是谁在评论对印第安人的战役？"
"Gentlemen who do not know a war-whoop from a wigwam, and who never have had to run a foot-race with a tomahawk, or pluck arrows out of the several members of their families to build the evening camp-fire with.","正是那些没有听见印第安人棚屋中的壮烈呐喊和从来没有拿过印第安人的战斧的绅士们，或者可以说是那些从来没有从家人身上拔下箭来烧起营火的人们。"
"Who write the temperance appeals, and clamor about the flowing bowl?","又是谁在写那些呼吁戒酒的文章，四处宣传喝酒的害处？"
"Folks who will never draw another sober breath till they do it in the grave.","就是那些直到进了坟墓，嘴巴里才不会有酒气的家伙们。"
"Who edit the agricultural papers, you—yam?","那么又是谁来编辑农业报纸呢？是你——你这个番薯吗？"
"Men, as a general thing, who fail in the poetry line, yellow-colored novel line, sensation, drama line, city-editor line, and finally fall back on agriculture as a temporary reprieve from the poorhouse.","大家都知道，只有那些写不了诗歌，写不出黄色小说和轰动剧本，连编辑都市新闻都不行的人，最后才会退居到农业这一行，把这里作为一个暂时的避难所。"
"You try to tell me anything about the newspaper business!","你竟然还想在办报纸这件事情上来教训我！"
"Sir, I have been through it from Alpha to Omaha, and I tell you that the less a man knows the bigger the noise he makes and the higher the salary he commands.","先生，我什么大风大浪没见过。告诉你吧！一个人越是无知，他就会越有名，那么他的薪水才会越高！"
"Heaven knows if I had but been ignorant instead of cultivated, and impudent instead of diffident, I could have made a name for myself in this cold, selfish world.","天知道，如果我不是像现在这样受过教育，而是愚昧无知；如果我不是谦虚谨慎，而是鲁莽轻率，说不定我早就在这个冷漠自私的世界里闯出一些名堂了。"
"I take my leave, sir.","我会走的，先生。"
"Since I have been treated as you have treated me, I am perfectly willing to go.","既然你这样对我，我当然非常愿意滚蛋！"
"But I have done my duty.","但是我已经完成了我的职责。"

"I said I could make your paper of interest to all classes—and I have.","我说过我可以让你的报纸受到各种人的喜爱——我做到了！"
"I said I could run your circulation up to twenty thousand copies, and if I had had two more weeks I’d have done it.","我说过，我会让你们的销量达到两万份，要是你再给我两个星期的时间我也可以做到。"
"And I’d have given you the best class of readers that ever an agricultural paper had—not a farmer in it, nor a solitary individual who could tell a watermelon-tree from a peach-vine to save his life.","我本来可以帮你得到一家农业报纸能找到的最好的读者群——没有一个农民，也没有一个能弄清楚西瓜树和桃子藤的区别的人，即使是要他的命他也不会知道。"
"You are the loser by this rupture, not me, Pie-plant.","我们的这次决裂是你的损失，不是我的，你这株食用大黄！"
