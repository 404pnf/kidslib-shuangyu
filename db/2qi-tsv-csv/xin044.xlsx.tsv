"""""""So he called another of his servants, and said to him:"""",""""所以，他招来另外一名仆人，并吩咐它说："""""""
"""""""‘Go to the thicket near the fork, where the boys killed your brothers, and directly they or the dogs see you return here as fast as ever you can."""",""""“去岔路口旁的灌木丛，那就是那几个男孩杀死你兄弟的地方。一旦他们或猎犬看到你，你就以最快的速度径直跑回到这儿。"""""""

"""""""Without thinking that they had nothing to defend themselves with, should the bear turn and attack them, the boys gave chase."""",""""兄弟俩抬腿就追，根本没有考虑到，万一这只熊掉头攻击他们，他们连防身的东西也没有。"""""""

"""""""‘Why are you trying to kill all my servants?’ asked the chief."""",""""“你为什么想要杀掉我所有的仆人？”熊大王质问道，"""""""
"""""""‘Look round and see their shades, with arrows sticking in them."""",""""“你往周围看看，看看它们的冤魂，身上还插着你们的箭。"""""""

""""""" And, without waiting for a reply, pressed forward to drive his arrow into the heart of the bear."""",""""然后，也不等大哥回话，就要冲上前，想将箭刺进熊的心脏。"""""""

"""""""And, stooping over a spring of water, he dipped a handful of moss in it and rubbed it over the arms and legs of the boys."""",""""说完，熊大王在一口山泉边上俯下身子，抓起一把苔藓，蘸了点儿泉水，然后涂在两兄弟的胳膊和腿上。"""""""
"""""""In an instant the transformation took place, and two creatures, neither beast nor human stood before the chief."""",""""变化即刻就发生了，很快，两个非人非兽的怪物就站在了熊大王面前。"""""""

"""""""He had not waited long, when the father came in sight, stooping as he went to look for his sons’ tracks in the snow."""",""""它没等一会儿，就看见了两兄弟的父亲，他正弯着腰寻找儿子在雪地上留下的足迹。"""""""
"""""""When he saw the marks of snow-shoes along the path on the right he was filled with joy, not knowing that the servant had made some fresh tracks on purpose to mislead him; and he hastened forward so fast that he fell headlong into a pit, where the bear was sitting."""",""""看见右边小径上的雪鞋印时，他欣喜不已，根本不知道那仆人制造了一些新足迹，目的就是为了误导他。他加速前进，不想一头栽进了陷坑，而那只熊正坐在里面。"""""""
"""""""Before he could pick himself up the bear had quietly broken his neck, and, hiding the body under the snow, sat down to see if anyone else would pass that way."""",""""没等他爬起来，那只熊就趁他不注意，拍断了他的脖子，并将尸体藏到雪里，然后坐下来，看是否还会有别的人经过。"""""""
"""""""Meanwhile the mother at home was wondering what had become of her two sons, and as the hours went on, and their father never returned, she made up her mind to go and look for him."""",""""与此同时，母亲在家一直担心两个儿子的状况，而且，好几个钟头过去了，他们的父亲还没回来，所以，她决定出去找他。"""""""
"""""""The youngest boy begged her to let him undertake the search, but she would not hear of it, and told him he must stay at home and take care of his sister."""",""""小儿子央求替她去寻找，可母亲不肯听，并嘱咐他一定要留在家里，照看妹妹。"""""""
"""""""So, slipping on her snow-shoes, she started on her way."""",""""因此，她匆忙穿上雪鞋就出发了。"""""""
"""""""As no fresh snow had fallen, the trail was quite easy to find, and she walked straight on, till it led her up to the pit where the bear was waiting for her."""",""""由于没有再下雪了，所以很容易找到丈夫留下的脚印，她顺着路直走，一直走到了陷坑，而熊正在那里等着她。"""""""
"""""""He grasped her as she fell and broke her neck, after which he laid her in the snow beside her husband, and went back to tell the bear chief."""",""""当她掉落下来时，熊一把将她抓住，拍断了她的脖子，然后将尸体埋到雪里，放在了她丈夫的旁边，之后便回到山上向熊大王复命。"""""""

"""""""Day after day the boy climbed to the top of a tall tree near the house, and sat there till he was almost frozen, looking on all sides through the forest openings, hoping that he might see someone coming along."""",""""每天，小儿子都会爬到屋旁一棵大树的顶端，坐在那里，透过森林的缝隙，四下张望，希望能看到有人往这边来，直到冻到几乎全身僵硬。"""""""
"""""""Very soon all the food in the house was eaten, and he knew he would have to go out and hunt for more."""",""""很快，屋里的所有食物都吃完了，他清楚自己得外出猎得更多的食物。"""""""
"""""""Besides, he wished to seek for his parents."""",""""除此之外，他也想寻找父母。"""""""
"""""""The little girl did not like being left alone in the hut, and cried bitterly; but her brother told her that there was no use sitting down quietly to starve, and that whether he found any game or not he would certainly be back before the following night."""",""""小姑娘又哭又喊，不愿意一个人留在棚屋里，但是哥哥告诉她，静静地坐着挨饿是没有用的，而且，无论他有没有发现猎物，他都一定会在天黑之前回来。"""""""
"""""""Then he cut himself some arrows, each from a different tree, and winged with the feathers of four different birds."""",""""然后，他削了一些箭，每一支都分别来自不同的树，而且都配上了用四种不同鸟的羽毛做成的箭尾。"""""""
"""""""He then made himself a bow, very light and strong, and got down his snow-shoes."""",""""之后，他又做了一张极其轻巧结实的弓，并且着手做他的雪鞋。"""""""
"""""""All this took some time, and he could not start that day, but early next morning he called his little dog Redmouth, whom he kept in a box, and set out."""",""""所有这一切都花费了一些时间，所以他当天没能出发。第二天一大早，他唤上他养在盒子里的小猎犬红嘴，就出门了。"""""""
"""""""After he had followed the trail for a great distance he grew very tired, and sat upon the branch of a tree to rest."""",""""顺着足迹走了很长一段路程后，他逐渐非常疲劳，便坐在一棵树的枝干上休息。"""""""
"""""""But Redmouth barked so furiously that the boy thought that perhaps his parents might have been killed under its branches, and stepping back, shot one of his arrows at the root of the tree."""",""""但红嘴却狂叫起来，老三心想，自己的父母说不定就是在这些枝干下被杀害的。于是，他后退几步，朝树根射了一箭。"""""""
"""""""Whereupon a noise like thunder shook it from top to bottom, fire broke out, and in a few minutes a little heap of ashes lay in the place where it had stood."""",""""一声雷鸣般的巨响随之而来，使整棵大树从头到尾剧烈摇晃，接着燃起了熊熊大火，几分钟后，大树所在的地方就只剩下一小堆灰烬了。"""""""
"""""""Not knowing quite what to make of it all, the boy continued on the trail, and went down the right-hand fork till he came to the clump of bushes where the bears used to hide."""",""""不太明白是什么造成了这一切，小儿子继续赶路，并踏上了右边的岔路，直到他来到熊过去躲藏的灌木丛。"""""""
"""""""Now, as was plain by his being able to change the shape of the two brothers, the bear chief knew a good deal of magic, and he was quite aware that the little boy was following the trail, and he sent a very small but clever bear servant to wait for him in the bushes and to try to tempt him into the mountain."""",""""再说熊大王，它既然能够将两兄弟变形，自然精通魔法，而且，他完全知道小儿子在一路搜寻，因此，它派了一个很小却机灵的熊仆人在灌木丛里等着他，设法将他诱进山来。"""""""
"""""""But somehow his spells could not have worked properly that day, as the bear chief did not know that Redmouth had gone with his master, or he would have been more careful."""",""""但是，不知怎的，它当天的魔法没那么灵了，因为，熊大王没有料到红嘴跟着它的主人一起来了，否则也不会那么大意。"""""""
"""""""For the moment the dog ran round the bushes barking loudly, the little bear servant rushed out in a fright, and set out for the mountains as fast as he could."""",""""猎犬一绕着灌木丛大叫，小熊仆人便吓得冲了出来，以最快的速度向山跑去。"""""""

"""""""But along the road the snow was so wet and heavy that the boy could hardly get along, and then the thong of his snow-shoes broke, and he had to stop and mend it, so that the bear and the dog got so far ahead that he could scarcely hear the barking."""",""""但是，一路上，积雪湿滑泥泞，老三跟得很吃力。这时，雪鞋的皮带又断了，他不得不停下来修补，因此他被熊和猎犬甩得很远，连犬吠声也几乎听不到了。"""""""
"""""""When the strap was firm again the boy spoke to his snow-shoes and said:"""",""""当鞋带再次被系牢后，老三对他的雪鞋说："""""""
