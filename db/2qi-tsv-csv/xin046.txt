"书名十月和六月（欧·亨利经典短篇小说）短简介爱情可以超越年龄吗？小说讲述了年轻的上尉追求一位少妇却被少妇以两人年龄差距过大为由而拒绝的故事。男主人公不甘心被拒来到少妇面前，少妇的解释让他却明白了年龄差距会给日后生活带来的种种不便。年龄的差距让一段美好的情缘无法展开。长简介一个是晚秋的十月，一个是暑夏的六月。小说一开始对于男主人公的描写，不禁让人联想到他是一位饱经战场风霜洗礼的老上尉，而下文对于女主人公的描写更让人想到她是一位风姿绰约的少妇。两者无可奈何的年龄的差距让少妇拒绝了上尉的求爱。当上尉千里迢迢来到少妇面前希望少妇重新考虑接受他的爱慕时，少妇对于年龄差距过大的解释让他有所顿悟，而小说结尾也出现了最大惊喜，原来拥有暑夏六月一样激情的是年轻的上尉，而有了晚秋十月一样冷静的是年长的少妇。欧亨利式的结尾让人倍感意外的同时，也叹息这一段无法开始的爱情。关键字十月和六月；欧·亨利；外研社编译组；短篇；爱情；追求；激情；理智；年龄；上尉；拒绝作者（美）欧·亨利作者简介欧·亨利（1862—1910），美国著名批判现实主义作家、世界三大短篇小说大师之一，被誉为“曼哈顿桂冠散文作家”和“美国现代短篇小说之父”。他的一生富于传奇性，做过药房学徒、会计、新闻记者、银行出纳等多个工作。其作品构思新颖，语言诙谐，人物众多，富于生活情趣，尤以出人意料的结尾闻名，被誉为“美国生活的幽默百科全书”。书评“君生我未生，我生君已老。恨不生同时，日日与君好。”在错的时间遇到对的人，也许只有一声无奈的叹息。"
