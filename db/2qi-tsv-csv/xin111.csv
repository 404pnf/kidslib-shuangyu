"Landscape with Figures","有人影的远景"
"by Ernest Hemingway","作者：欧内斯特·海明威"
"It was very strange in that house.","那栋房子里的情况奇怪极了。"
"The elevator, of course, no longer ran.","电梯自然早已停开。"
"The steel column it slid up and down on was bent and there were several marble stairs in the six flights which were broken so that you had to walk carefully on the edges as you climbed so that you would not fall through.","它顺着上下滑动的那根钢柱也已经弯曲了。六层的大理石楼梯，有好几级都破裂了，所以爬楼梯时，你必须小心地踩在边上，免得掉下去。"
"There were doors which opened onto rooms where there were no longer any rooms and you could swing a perfectly sound-looking door open and step across the door sill into space: that floor and the next three floors below having been blasted out of the front of the apartment house by direct hits by high explosive shells.","有些通向房间的门后面其实早已没有了房间。要是你扭开一扇看上去完好无损的门，一脚跨过门槛，便很可能踩空：这座公寓楼曾被高爆炮弹直接击中，四楼和底下三层的正面都被炸掉了。"
"Yet the two top floors had four rooms on the front of the house which were intact and there was still running water in the back rooms on all of the floors.","但是最高两层的正面倒有四个房间还完好无损，所有楼层背面的房间也都还有自来水。"
"We called this house the Old Homestead.","我们叫这栋房子“老宅子”。"
"The front line had, at the vey worst moment, been directly below this apartment house along the upper edge of the little plateau that the boulevard circled and the trench and the weather-rotted sandbags were still there.","在战争最严峻的时候，前线就在这栋公寓的正下方，位于林阴大道环绕的小高地顶上的边沿。战壕和被淋坏晒烂的沙袋至今仍在原处。"
"They were so close you could throw a broken tile or a piece of mortar from the smashed apartment house down into them as you stood on one of the balconies.","它们是那么近，以至于站在这座残破公寓的一个阳台上，你就可以扔块破瓦或者灰泥片过去。"
"But now the line had been pushed down from the lip of the plateau, across the river and up into the pine-studded slope of the hill that rose behind the old royal hunting lodge that was called the Caso del Campo.","但现在前线已经从高地边沿推进到了河对岸松树散布的山坡上，那座小山就耸立在一个叫“村舍”的旧日皇家猎舍后面。"
"It was there that the fighting was going on, now, and we used the Old Homestead both as an observation post and as an advantage point to film from.","现在战斗就是在那里进行着，我们把“老宅子”当作观察哨和拍摄新闻片的有利地点。"
"In those days it was very dangerous and always cold and we were always hungry and we joked a great deal.","那时形势非常危险，天总是那么冷，我们又总是饿肚子，但常常开玩笑。"
"Each time a shell bursts in a building it makes a great cloud of brick and plaster dust and when this settles it coats the surface of a mirror so that it is as powdered as the windows which have been calcimined over in a new building.","每次炮弹击中建筑物，砖块和石膏都被炸成粉末，像一大团云；等它们落下来，镜面上全是灰，就像新房子的窗上涂了白粉一样。"
"There was a tall unbroken mirror in one of the rooms of that house giving off the stairs as you climbed and on its dusty surface I printed, with my finger, in large letters DEATH TO JOHNNY and we then sent Johnny, the camera-man, into that room on some pretext.","顺着这栋房子的楼梯往上爬，你会发现楼梯旁延伸出的一个房间里居然有面长镜没有破损。我用手指在布满灰尘的镜面上划下了大大的“约翰尼必死”的字样，然后我们找了个托词让摄影师约翰尼到那个房间去。"
"When he opened the door, during a shelling, and saw that ghostly announcement staring at him from the glass he went into a white, deadly, Dutch rage and it was quite a time before we were friends again.","当时正是炮击关头，他打开门看见那可怕的宣告直勾勾地从镜子里盯着他，顿时就面色煞白、勃然大怒，为此过了好久我们才重归于好。"
"Then the next day when we were loading the equipment into a car in front of the hotel I got into the car and cranked up the glass of the side window as it was bitterly cold.","第二天，我们在旅馆前面往一辆车里装器材。天气非常寒冷，于是我上车后就把一边的窗玻璃摇了上去。"
"As the glass rose I saw, printed on it with large red letters in what must have been a borrowed lipstick, ED IS A LICE.","车窗摇起后，我看见上面印着几个红色的大字：“埃德是个虱子”，想必是用借来的口红写上去的。"
"We used the car for several days with that mysterious, to the Spaniards, slogan.","一连几天我们都在用这辆写着标语的车，这标语在西班牙人看来很神秘。"
"They must have taken it for the initials or slogan of some Holland-American revolutionary organization perhaps resembling the F.A.I. or the C.N.T.","他们一定把这几个字当成了某个荷兰或美国的革命组织（也许类似F.A.I.或者C.N.T.这样的组织）的名称缩写或标语。"
"Then there was the day when the great British authority on let us forget just what came to town.","后来有一天，有位英国官员却使我们忘记了之前的那点儿不快。"
"He had a huge, German-type steel helmet which he wore on all expeditions in the direction of the front.","他有顶巨大的德国式钢盔，每次出行，只要是往前线方向去，他都会戴着它。"
"This was an item of clothing which none of the rest of us affected.","对这种装束我们都没什么好感。"
"It was the general theory that since there were not many steel helmets these should be reserved for the shock troops and his wearing of this helmet formed in us an instant prejudice against the Great Authority.","按常理，既然这种钢盔并不多，就应该留给突击部队。因此这位大员戴着这顶钢盔让我们立即对他产生了反感。"
"We had met in the room of an American woman journalist who had a splendid electric heater.","我们是在一位美国女记者的住所里碰上的，那位女记者有只上好的电炉。"
"The Authority took an instant fancy to this very pleasant room and named it the Club.","官员很快就喜欢上了那个舒适的房间，还叫它“俱乐部”。"
"His proposal was that everyone should bring their own liquor there and be able to enjoy it in the warmth and pleasant atmosphere.","他建议大家都自带酒水，好在这温暖、愉悦的气氛中享用。"
"As the American girl was exceedingly hard-working and had been trying, perhaps not too successfully, to keep her room from becoming in any sense the Club, this definite baptism and classification came as rather a blow to her.","可那美国女记者工作极其勤奋，一直努力不让自己的住所染上“俱乐部”的色彩（虽然也许不是太成功）。因此这样明确的命名和归类对她来说是个不小的打击。"
"We were working there in the Old Homestead the next day, shielding the camera lens as carefully as possible against the glare of the afternoon sun with a screen of broken matting, when the Authority arrived accompanied by the American girl.","第二天，我们正在“老宅子”里工作，用一条破席子当屏风，尽可能小心地让摄像机镜头避开下午耀眼的阳光，这时候那位官员由美国女记者陪着来了。"
"He had heard us discussing the location at the Club and had come to pay a visit.","他在“俱乐部”里听我们谈到过这个场所，就特意过来看看。"
"I was using a pair of field glasses, eight power, small Zeisses that you could cover with your two hands so that they gave no reflection, and was observing from the shadow in the angle of the broken balcony.","当时我正在破阳台一角的阴影里用一副双筒望远镜观察。那是小型的八倍蔡司镜，用双手一盖，它就不会反光了。"
"The attack was about to start and we were waiting for the planes to come over and commence the bombardment which substituted for adequate artillery preparation due to the Government’s then shortage of heavy artillery.","这时进攻快要开始了，我们等待着飞机过来开始轰炸，以此来代替当时由于政府缺乏重炮而没作好的炮击准备。"
"We had worked in the house, concealing ourselves as carefully as rats do because the success of our work and the possibility of continued observation depended altogether on not drawing any fire on the seemingly deserted building.","我们一向在那房子里工作，把自己像耗子一样小心地藏起来。因为要想工作成功，有继续观测的可能，就绝不能给这栋看似被遗弃的公寓招来任何炮火。"
"Now into the room came the Great Authority, and drawing up one of the empty chairs, seated himself in the exact center of the open balcony, steel helmet, over-sized binoculars and all.","此时，官员走进房间，拉了一把空椅子，坐在一览无余的开敞式阳台的正中心，钢盔、大号望远镜等等一应俱全。"
"The camera was at an angle on one side of the balcony window as carefully camouflaged as a machine gun.","摄影机斜设在阳台窗户的一侧，像机关枪一样被精心伪装。"
"I was in the angle of shadow on the other, invisible to anyone on the hillside, and always careful never to move across the sunny open space.","我则是在另一侧布满阴影的角落里（山坡上的任何人都看不见我），而且一直注意从不穿过阳光照射的开阔处。"
"The Authority was seated in plain sight in the middle of the sunny patch looking, in his steel hat, like the head of all the general staffs in the world, his glasses blinking in the sun like a helio.","而这官员却堂而皇之坐在向阳地中间，头戴钢盔，像全球参谋部的总指挥似的。他的望远镜在阳光下闪闪发光，像一架日光反射信号器。"
"“Look,” I said to him.","“你看，”我对他说，"
"“We have to work here.","“我们得在这儿工作。"
"From where you’re sitting your glasses make a blink that everybody on that hill can see.”","你坐在这儿，望远镜反射的光能叫山上所有的人都看见。”"
"“Ay dount think theys aneh dainjah een a house,” the Authority said with calm and condescending dignity.","“我觉得在房子里没有任何危险。”官员用高高在上的口气平静地说。"
"“If you ever hunted mountain sheep,” I said, “you know they can see you as far as you can see them.","“你要是打过野山羊，”我说，“就应该知道：要是你看得到它们，它们也能看到你。"
"Do you see how clearly you see the men with your glasses?","你没发现用你的望远镜看那些人有多清楚吗？"
"They have glasses too.”","他们也有望远镜的。”"
"“Ay dount think theys aneh dainjah een a house,” the Authority repeated.","“我觉得在房子里没有任何危险，”官员重复道，"
"“Wheah are the tanks?”","“坦克在哪儿呢？”"
"“There,” I said.","“在那儿，”我说，"
"“Under the trees.”","“树底下。”"
"The two cameramen were making grimaces and shaking their clenched fists over their heads in fury.","两个摄影师露出厌恶的表情，生气地在头顶上挥动攥紧的拳头。"
"“I go to take the big camera into the back,” Johnny said.","“我把大摄影机拿到后面去。”约翰尼说。"
"“Keep well back, daughter,” I said to the American girl.","“小妞儿，乖乖待在后面。”我冲那美国女记者说。"
"Then, to the Authority, “They take you for somebody’s staff, you know.","然后我又告诉官员：“你知道吧，他们把你当谁的参谋了！"
"They see that tin hat and those glasses and they think we’re running the battle.","他们看到你的钢盔和望远镜，还以为我们在指挥作战呢！"
"You’re asking for it, you know.”","你这是在自找麻烦，知道吗？”"
"He repeated his refrain.","他还是重复着那句老话。"
"It was at that minute that the first one hit us.","就在那一刻，第一颗炮弹袭击了我们。"
"It came with a noise like a bursted steam pipe combined with a ripping of canvas and with the burst and the roar and rattle of broken plaster and the dust smoke over us I had the girl out of the room and into the back of the apartment.","它发出一声巨响，那声音就像蒸汽管爆裂加上帆布撕裂。在爆炸的轰隆声和破碎的灰墙掉下时发出的嘎嘎声里，我推着那女记者跑出烟雾弥漫的房间，躲到公寓后面的房间里。"
"As I dove through the door something with a steel hat on passed me going for the stairs.","正当我冲出房门，一个戴着钢盔的家伙从我身边一闪而过，向楼梯那边跑去。"
"You may think a rabbit moves fast when it first jumps and starts zigzagging away, but the Authority moved through that smoke-filled hall, down those tricky stairs, out the door, and down the street faster than any rabbit.","你或许会觉得一只兔子一跃而起，左一蹦右一跳地跑掉时的速度已经够快了。可这位官员窜过烟雾弥漫的走廊，冲下那难走的楼梯，夺门而出，钻到街上的速度可要快过任何一只兔子。"
"One of the cameramen said he had no speed on the lens of his Leica which would stop him in motion.","我们的一位摄影师说他的莱卡摄像机的镜头都来不及定格官员的动作。"
"This of course is inaccurate but it gives the effect.","这固然有些过甚之辞，但也说得一针见血。"
"Anyway they shelled the house fast for about a minute.","总之他们对这栋公寓快速轰炸了大约一分钟。"
"They came on such a flat trajectory you hardly had time to hold a breath between the rush and the jolt and roar of the burst.","炮弹沿着直线轨迹飞射过来，陡然一震，轰地一响。在这期间你几乎没有时间来屏住呼吸。"
"Then after the last one we waited a couple of minutes to see if it had stopped, had a drink of water from the tap in the kitchen sink, and found a new room to set up the camera.","最后一次轰炸过后，我们等了几分钟，看是真的结束了，于是我们就到厨房，拧开水池上的水龙头喝了点儿水，又重新找了个房间，架起摄影机。"
"The attack was just starting.","进攻正好刚刚开始。"
"The American girl was very bitter against the Authority.","美国女记者恨透了那个官员。"
"“He brought me here,” she said.","“是他带我来这儿的，”她说，"
"“He said it was quite safe.","“还说这里很安全。"
"And he went away and did not even say good-bye.”","可他却跑掉了，连‘再见’也没说。”"
"“He cahnt be a gentleman,” I said.","“他可不是个绅士啊，”我说，"
"“Look, daughter.","“你瞧，小妞。"
"Watch.","快看。"
"Now.","就现在。"
"There it goes.”","开始啦！”"
"Below us some men stood up, half crouching, and ran forward toward a stone house in a patch of trees.","地面上有些士兵站起来，半弯着腰，朝一小片树林里的一座石头房子跑去。"
"The house was disappearing in the sudden fountainings of dust clouds from the shells that were registering on it.","炮弹瞄准房子打去，那房子便逐渐消失在突然腾起的阵阵尘雾中了。"
"The wind blew the dust clear after each shell so that the house kept showing plainly through the dust as a ship comes out of a fog and ahead of the men a tank lurched fast like a round-topped, gun-snouted beetle and went out of sight in the trees.","每次轰炸后，风把尘土吹尽，房子就像从雾里驶出的船一样清楚地显现出来。在士兵面前，有辆坦克颠簸着飞快前进，像只圆顶炮形鼻的甲虫，开进树林里就不见了。"
"As you watched, the men who were running forward threw themselves flat.","正看着，那群跑步前进的士兵扑倒在地上。"
"Then another tank went forward on the left and into the trees and you could see the flash of its firing and in the smoke that blew from the house one of the men who was on the ground stood up and ran wildly back toward the trench that they had left when they attacked.","接着另一辆坦克从左边冲上前去，进了树林，还可以看得到它开火的闪光。在石头房子冒出的烟雾中，扑在地上的一名士兵站了起来，发了疯似的跑回当初他们发动攻击时离开的战壕。"
"Another got up and ran back, holding his rifle in one hand, his other hand on his head.","另一名士兵也起身往回跑，一手抓着步枪，一手抱着头。"
"Then they were running back from all along the line.","后来，战线上的士兵全都往回跑。"
"Some fell as they ran.","有些人跑着跑着就倒下了。"
"Others lay on the ground without ever having got up.","有些躺在地上就再也起不来了。"
"They were scattered all over the hillside.","他们散落在山坡各处。"
"“What’s happened?” the girl asked.","“怎么回事？”女记者问。"
"“The attack has failed,” I said.","“进攻失败了。”我说。"
"“Why?”","“为什么？”"
"“It wasn’t pushed home.”","“没有坚持到底。”"
"“Why?","“为什么？"
"Wasn’t it just as dangerous for them to run back as to go forward?”","他们后退不是跟前进一样危险吗？”"
"“Not quite.”","“不一定。”"
"The girl held the field glasses to her eyes.","女记者举起望远镜看，"
"Then she put them down.","可是又放下了。"
"“I can’t see any more,” she said.","“我看不下去了。”她说。"
"The tears were running down her cheeks and her face was working.","泪水顺着她的双颊流下，脸上还在抽搐。"
"I had never seen her cry before and we had seen many things you could cry about if you were going to cry.","我从没见过她哭，如果要哭，我们见过许多可以大哭的事情。"
"In a war everybody of all ranks including generals cries at some time or another.","打仗时，各个军衔的人，包括将军，有时也会流泪。"
"This is true, no matter what people tell you, but it is to be avoided, and is avoided, and I had not seen this girl doing it before.","不管人们对你说什么，这句话才是实情。但眼泪总是能忍则忍，而人们也确实是这样做的，所以之前我还没见过这个女孩哭。"
"“And that’s an attack?”","“这就是一场进攻？”"
"“That’s an attack,” I said.","“这就是场进攻，”我说，"
"“Now you’ve seen one.”","“现在你见识到了。”"
"“And what will happen?”","“那以后会有什么事发生呢？”"
"“They may send them again if there’s enough people left to lead them.","“要是还有足够的人剩下指挥军队的话，他们或许还会再派他们过去。"
"I doubt if they will.","我倒不觉得他们会这么做。"
"You can count the losses out there if you like.”","你不妨数数那边损失了多少人。”"
"“Are those men all dead?”","“那些人全死了吗？”"
"“No.","“没有。"
"Some are too badly wounded to move.","有些人伤得太重，不能动了。"
"They will bring them in in the dark.”","天黑时，会有人把他们抬下去。”"
"“What will the tanks do now?”","“那些坦克现在怎么办呢？”"
"“They’ll go home if they’re lucky.”","“要是幸运的话它们可以撤回去。”"
"But one of them was already unlucky.","可是它们中的一辆很不幸。"
"In the pine woods a black dirty column of smoke began to rise and was then blown sideways by the wind.","松林里升起一股黑污的烟柱，并随风飘向一边。"
"Soon it was a rolling black cloud and in the greasy black smoke you could see the red flames.","它很快就扩大成一团翻滚的黑云，在油污的黑烟中还能看得见红色的火舌。"
"There was an explosion and a billowing of white smoke and then the black smoke rolled higher; but from a wider base.","只听见一声爆炸声，冒出一团翻滚着的白烟，然后黑烟就窜得更高了；可是下面着火的范围也更大了。"
"“That’s a tank,” I said.","“那是一辆坦克，”我说，"
"“Burning.”","“起火了。”"
"We stood and watched.","我们站在那里继续看着。"
"Through the glasses you could see two men get out of an angle of the trench and start up a slant of the hill carrying a stretcher.","透过望远镜可以看见两个人从战壕的一个角落里爬了出来，抬起一副担架，顺着一道斜坡往小山上爬去。"
"They seemed to move slowly and ploddingly.","看上去他们爬得缓慢而吃力。"
"As you watched the man in front sank onto his knees and then sat down.","看着看着，前面那人腿一弯跪下了，随后便一屁股坐了下去。"
"The man behind had dropped to the ground.","后面那人早就扑倒在地上。"
"He crawled forward.","他向前爬去。"
"Then with his arm under the first man’s shoulder he started to crawl, dragging him toward the trench.","然后用手臂撑着前面那人的肩膀，拖着他向战壕爬去。"
"Then he stopped moving and you saw that he was lying flat on his face.","过了一会儿他停止了移动，只见他脸朝下，直挺挺地趴在那里。"
"They both lay there not moving now.","这样两个人都躺在那里不动了。"
"They had stopped shelling the house and it was quiet now.","对房子的炮击停止了，此刻四下一片宁静。"
"The big farmhouse and walled court showed clear and yellow against the green hillside that was scarred white with the dirt where the strong points had been fortified and the communication trenches dug.","那间大大的农舍和砌了围墙的院子在青色山坡的映衬下黄得十分显眼。由于据点上加筑了防御工事，又挖了交通壕，山坡被翻起的尘土弄得白斑累累。"
"There was smoke from small fires rising now over the hillside where men were cooking.","这时山坡上有些小火堆升起细烟，那是行军的人在做饭。"
"And up the slope toward the big farmhouse lay the casualties of the attack like many scattered bundles on the green slope.","顺着斜坡往上直到大农舍，一路上都躺着这场进攻战遗下的伤亡士兵，就好像许多包裹散落在青草坡上。"
"The tank was burning black and greasy in the trees.","那辆坦克还在树林里燃烧，已经烧得又黑又油了。"
"“It’s horrible,” the girl said.","“太可怕了，”女记者说，"
"“It’s the first time I’ve ever seen it.","“我生平还是第一次见到这种场面。"
"It’s really horrible.”","实在太可怕了。”"

"“Don’t you hate it?”","“你难道不觉得讨厌吗？”"
"“I hate it and I always have hated it.","“我讨厌。我一直就很讨厌。"
"But when you have to do it you ought to know how.","但干一行就得懂一行。"
"That was a frontal attack.","这是一场正面攻击战。"
"They are just murder.”","打正面攻击战就等于谋杀。”"
"“Are there other ways to attack?”","“有别的进攻办法吗？”"
"“Oh sure.","“噢，当然有。"
"Lots of them.","办法多了。"
"But you have to have knowledge and discipline and trained squad and section leaders.","但你必须先有军事知识、军队纪律和受过训练的班长、排长。"
"And most of all you ought to have surprise.”","并且最重要的是你应该有出奇制胜的计谋。”"
"“It makes now too dark to work,” Johnny said putting the cap over his telephoto lens.","“现在天色太黑没法工作，”约翰尼说着就把他的远距镜头的盖子盖上了，"
"“Hello you old lice.","“喂，‘lice’老兄。"
"Now we go home to the hotel.","现在我们回旅馆去吧。"
"Today we work pretty good.”","今天我们的活干得相当不错。”"
"“Yes,” said the other one.","“是啊，”另一个摄影师说，"
"“Today we have got something very good.","“今天我们拍到了一些很好的东西。"

"Sometime we film a successful attack.","希望改天我们能拍到一次成功的进攻。"
"Only always with a successful attack it rains or snows.”","只是进攻胜利的时候往往不是下雨就是下雪。”"
"“I don’t want to see any more ever,” the girl said.","“我再也不想看这些了，”那女记者说，"
"“I’ve seen it now.","“我今天算是见识过了。"
"Nothing would ever make me see it for curiosity or to make money writing about it.","没有什么能引诱我再看这些了——无论是好奇心，还是靠它写文章赚大钱。"
"Those are men as we are.","那些人和我们一样都是血肉之躯的男子汉啊！"
"Look at them there on that hillside.”","可瞧瞧他们，就那样躺在山坡上了。”"
"“You are not men,” said Johnny.","“你可不是男子汉，”约翰尼说，"
"“You are a womans.","“你是个女儿家。"
"Don’t make a confusion.”","不要混淆了。”"
"“Comes now the steel hat man,” said the other looking out of the window."," “现在那个戴钢盔的家伙又来了，”另一个摄影师望着窗外说，"
"“Comes now with much dignity.","“大模大样地来了。"
"I wish I had bomb to throw to make suddenly a surprise.”","我真希望我手里有颗炸弹，扔出去冷不丁吓他个半死。”"
"We were packing up the cameras and equipment when the steel-hatted Authority came in.","我们正收拾着摄影机和相关器材，那戴钢盔的官员进来了。"
"“Hullo,” he said.","“哈罗，”他说道，"
"“Did you make some good pictures?","“你拍到些好照片了吗？"
"I have a car in one of the back streets to take you home, Elizabeth.”","伊丽莎白，我有辆车停在后面的一条街上，我来送你回去。”"
"“I’m going home with Edwin Henry,” the girl said.","“我要跟埃德温·亨利一起回去。”女记者说。"
"“Did the wind die down?”","“风小点儿了吗？”"
"I asked him conversationally.","我出于礼节跟他搭话。"
"He let that go by and said to the girl, “You won’t come?”","他没搭理我，继续问女记者：“你不走？”"
"“No,” she said.","“不，”女记者说，"
"“We are all going home together.”","“我们大家准备一块走。”"
"“I’ll see you at the Club tonight.” he said to me very pleasantly.","“今晚‘俱乐部’见。”他乐呵呵地对我说。"
"“You don’t belong to the Club any more.”","“你已经不再是‘俱乐部’的人了。”"
"I told him, speaking as nearly English as I could.","我尽量学着英国人的腔调告诉他。"
"We all started down the stairs together, being very careful about the holes in the marble, and walking over and around the new damage.","大家一起下楼。因为大理石上有窟窿，我们走得十分小心。再加上公寓又添了“新伤”，我们只得一一跨过、绕过。"
"It seemed a very long stairway."
"I picked up a brass nose-cap flattened and plaster marked at the end and handed it to the girl called Elizabeth.","我捡起一个铜制的机头盖帽，已经被撞扁了，底部还有石膏的划痕。我将它递给了那个叫伊丽莎白的女记者。"
"“I don’t want it.” she said and at the doorway we all stopped and let the steel-hatted man go on ahead alone.","“我不想要。”她说。到了门口，大家都停了下来，让那个戴钢盔的家伙一个人走在前头。"
"He walked with great dignity across the part of the street where you were sometimes fired on and continued on, with dignity, in the shelter of the wall opposite.","他架子十足地穿过间或有冷枪打来的那一段街道。在对面围墙的掩护下，他继续往前走着，仍然架子十足。"
"Then, one at a time, we sprinted across to the lee of the wall.","于是，我们也一次一个，冲到围墙的庇护下。"
"It is the third or fourth man to cross an open space who draws the fire, you learn after you have been around a while, and we were always pleased to be across that particular place.","只要在这里待过一阵子，你就会知道往往第三个或者第四个穿过开阔地的人会招来敌人的火力。所以只要过了这个关口，我们总是挺高兴的。"
"So we walked up the street now, protected by the wall, four abreast, carrying the cameras and stepping over the new iron fragments, the freshly broken bricks, and the blocks of stone, and watching the dignity of the walk of the steel-hatted man ahead who no longer belonged to the Club.","于是我们四个人就在围墙的掩护下并排沿着大街走，手里拿着摄影机，脚下跨过刚飞来的铁片、新碎的砖块，还有成块的石头，一路上看着前面那个戴钢盔的家伙（他已经不再是“俱乐部”的人了）架子十足的步态。"
"“I hate to write a dispatch,” I said.","“真讨厌，我还得写篇电讯稿，”我说，"
"“It’s not going to be an easy one to write.","“今天的稿可不好写。"
"This offensive is gone.”","谁叫这次进攻失败了呢。”"
"“What’s the matter with you, boy?” asked Johnny.","“你这是怎么了，老兄？”约翰尼问。"
"“You must write what can be said,” the other one said gently.","“你必须写些可以说的事情，”另一个摄影师轻声说，"
"“Certainly something can be said about a day so full of events.”","“今天发生的事情这么多，当然有话可说咯。”"
"“When will they get the wounded back?” the girl asked.","“他们什么时候把伤员弄回来？”女记者问。"
"She wore no hat and walked with a long loose stride and her hair, which was a dusty yellow in the fading light, hung over the collar of her short, fur-collared jacket.","她没戴帽子，散漫地跨着大步子。头发披在皮领短夹克衫的领子上，在越来越昏暗的光线下现出灰黄的颜色。"
"It swung as she turned her head.","她回过头来，头发也跟着一甩。"
"Her face was white and she looked ill.","她脸色苍白，看上去好像病了。"
"“I told you as soon as it gets dark.”","“我不是告诉你了吗？等天一黑就把伤员弄回去。”"
"“God make it get dark quick,” she said.","“上帝保佑，快点儿天黑吧，”她说，"
"“So that’s war.","“看来这就是战争。"
"That’s what I’ve come here to see and write about.","这就是我来到这里要看和写的东西。"
"Were those two men killed who went out with the stretcher?”","那两个抬担架出去的人死了吗？”"
"“Yes,” I said.","“死了，”我说，"
"“Positively.”","“肯定死了。”"
"“They moved so slowly.” the girl said pitifully.","“他们行动太慢了。”女孩怜悯地说。"
"“Sometime’s it’s very hard to make the legs move,” I said.","“人有时候想走却很难迈开腿，”我说，"
"“It’s like walking in deep sand or in a dream.”","“就像在深沙或梦里走路似的。”"
"Ahead of us the man in the steel hat was still walking up the street.","我们前面那个戴钢盔的人还是一直沿着大街在走。"
"There was a line of shattered houses on his left and the brick wall of the barracks on his right.","他左边是一排残破的房子，右边是营房的砖墙。"
"His car was parked at the end of the street where ours was also standing in the lee of a house.","他的车停在大街的尽头，而我们的车也停在那里一所房子的背风面。"
"“Let’s take him back to the Club,” the girl said.","“我们还是带他回‘俱乐部’吧，”女记者说，"
"“I don’t want anyone to be hurt tonight.","“我可不想任何人今晚受伤。"
"Not their feelings nor anything.","无论是在感情上，还是什么别的方面。"
