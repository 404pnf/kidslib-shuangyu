The Killing of Julius Caesar “Localized”	尤利乌斯·恺撒之死的“本地报道”
by Mark Twain	作者：马克·吐温
Being the only true and reliable account ever published; taken from the Roman “Daily Evening Fasces,” of the date of that tremendous occurrence.	这是所有已发表报道中唯一真实可靠的报道，摘自这一骇人事件发生当日的罗马《法西斯晚报》。
Nothing in the world affords a newspaper reporter so much satisfaction as gathering up the details of a bloody and mysterious murder and writing them up with aggravating circumstantiality.	先是收集一起血腥又神秘的谋杀案的细节，再极为详尽地写成报道，这给一名新闻记者带来的成就感，远远超越了世上其他任何事情。
He takes a living delight in this labor of love—for such it is to him, especially if he knows that all the other papers have gone to press, and his will be the only one that will contain the dreadful intelligence.	新闻记者爱做这种事情，并从中获得极大的乐趣——尤其是当他知道其他报纸都已付印，他的报道将是对这桩惊天秘闻的独家报道的时候。
A feeling of regret has often come over me that I was not reporting in Rome when Caesar was killed—reporting on an evening paper, and the only one in the city, and getting at least twelve hours ahead of the morning-paper boys with this most magnificent “item” that ever fell to the lot of the craft.	恺撒遇刺之时，我没能在罗马报道，这常常让我感到遗憾——我没能在城中唯一的晚报上报道此事，至少没能提前12个小时，赶在送晨报那帮孩子之前，报道我们这一行难得一遇的最重量级的“头条”。
Other events have happened as startling as this, but none that possessed so peculiarly all the characteristics of the favorite “item” of the present day, magnified into grandeur and sublimity by the high rank, fame, and social and political standing of the actors in it.	同样震撼人心的事件也发生过，但从来都没有一件如此奇特，能包含所有当今最受欢迎“头条”新闻所具有的要素，加上事件中的人物身居高位、声名远扬，社会、政治地位显赫，更令这一事件显得异常轰动。
However, as I was not permitted to report Caesar’s assassination in the regular way, it has at least afforded me rare satisfaction to translate the following able account of it from the original Latin of the Roman Daily Evening Fasces of that date—second edition:	然而，虽说我没能获得按常规方式报道恺撒遇刺一事的许可，但是有机会把这篇刊载在当天罗马《法西斯晚报》第二版上的精彩拉丁文报道翻译过来，仅仅是这样我也觉得有一种特别的满足感。以下为译文：
Our usually quiet city of Rome was thrown into a state of wild excitement yesterday by the occurrence of one of those bloody affrays which sicken the heart and fill the soul with fear, while they inspire all thinking men with forebodings for the future of a city where human life is held so cheaply and the gravest laws are so openly set at defiance.	昨天，一场令人憎恶和恐惧的血腥残杀使平日宁静的罗马城顿时慌乱躁动起来，这使所有善于思考的人预见到这座城市的未来：视人命如草芥，最为庄重威严的法律遭到公然挑衅。
As the result of that affray, it is our painful duty, as public journalists, to record the death of one of our most esteemed citizens—a man whose name is known wherever this paper circulates, and where fame it has been our pleasure and our privilege to extend, and also to protect from the tongue of slander and falsehood, to the best of our poor ability.	杀戮过后，作为记者，我们那让人痛苦的职责就是要将我们最可敬的一位市民的遇刺过程记录下来——他的名字在这份报纸所发行的地区人人皆知，我们乐意并怀着极大的荣耀去宣扬他的声名，同时为保护他免遭恶意诋毁和谣言诬陷贡献我们的微薄之力。
We refer to Mr. J. Caesar, the Emperor-elect.	我们说的就是当选的君主——J. 恺撒先生。
The facts of the case, as nearly as our reporter could determine them from the conflicting statements of eye-witnesses, were about as follows:—The affair was an election row, of course.	根据目击证人们互相矛盾的证词，本报记者所能作出的最接近事实真相的推断如下：这是一起大选纠纷事件，不出所料。
Nine-tenths of the ghastly butcheries that disgrace the city nowadays grow out of the bickerings and jealousies and animosities engendered by these accursed elections.	现在，在给这座城市抹黑的骇人屠杀案中，十例有九例是出于由该死的选举所引发的口角、嫉妒和憎恨。
Rome would be the gainer by it if her very constables were elected to serve a century; for in our experience we have never even been able to choose a dog-pelter without celebrating the event with a dozen knockdowns and a general cramming of the station-house with drunken vagabonds overnight.	如果罗马民众能够选举出治安官，且任期为一百年，罗马也许就会大大获益。因为在我们的印象中，不打上十几场架，不在一夜之间给警局塞满醉醺醺的流氓，不通过这些方式来庆祝一下，我们连个无足轻重的小官都可能选不出来。
It is said that when the immense majority for Caesar at the polls in the market was declared the other day, and the crown was offered to that gentleman, even his amazing unselfishness in refusing it three times was not sufficient to save him from the whispered insults of such men as Casca, of the Tenth Ward, and other hirelings of the disappointed candidate, hailing mostly from the Eleventh and Thirteenth and other outside districts, who were overheard speaking ironically and contemptuously of Mr. Caesar’s conduct upon that occasion.	据说几天前，恺撒所获得的超高票数在集市上被公布出来，人们要给这位绅士加冕，他异常无私地拒绝了三次，但这都不足以让他远离某些人背后的恶言恶语，其中便包括来自第十选区落选的卡斯卡，还有他手下的雇员。有人听到他们对恺撒先生拒绝加冕的举动冷嘲热讽、不屑一顾。而欢呼的声音则大多来自第十一选区、第十三选区及其他一些偏远的选区。
We are further informed that there are many among us who think they are justified in believing that the assassination of Julius Caesar was a put-up thing—a cut-and-dried arrangement, hatched by Marcus Brutus and a lot of his hired roughs, and carried out only too faithfully according to the program.	进而，我们又了解到，不少市民相信，暗杀尤利乌斯·恺撒一事早有预谋，它是由马库斯·布鲁图和他雇来的一群恶徒谋划的，并最终得以按计划全盘执行，而且他们觉得这种推测是有充分理由的。
Whether there be good grounds for this suspicion or not, we leave to the people to judge for themselves, only asking that they will read the following account of the sad occurrence carefully and dispassionately before they render that judgment.	这种怀疑究竟能不能站得住脚，还是留给大众自行判断吧，我们只请求大家在得出结论之前，先认真冷静地读完下面这篇有关这一悲惨事件的报道。
The Senate was already in session, and Caesar was coming down the street toward the capitol, conversing with some personal friends, and followed, as usual, by a large number of citizens.	元老院会议已经开始，恺撒正沿街道朝朱庇特神殿走去，他边走边和几个有私交的朋友说着话，身后像往常一样跟着一众市民。
Just as he was passing in front of Demosthenes and Thucydides’ drug store, he was observing casually to a gentleman, who, our informant thinks, is a fortune-teller, that the Ides of March were come.	就在他走过狄摩西尼—修昔底德杂货店前时，他和一位绅士不经意地说起，3月15日到了。我们的线人认为这位绅士是个算命先生。
The reply was, “Yes, they are come, but not gone yet.”	那人回答说：“是的，是到了，可还没过完。”
At this moment Artemidorus stepped up and passed the time of day, and asked Caesar to read a schedule or a tract or something of the kind, which he had brought for his perusal.	这时，阿特米德洛斯走上前来，和恺撒寒暄了一番，然后让他看一份日程表，也可能是一本小册子或其他类似的东西，那是他带过来让恺撒审查的。
Mr. Decius Brutus also said something about an “humble suit” which he wanted read.	徳西乌斯·布鲁图先生也说想让恺撒看一件“小事”的相关资料。
Artemidorus begged that attention might be paid to his first, because it was of personal consequence to Caesar.	阿特米德洛斯恳求恺撒先看看自己带来的东西，因为这关乎恺撒自身。
The latter replied that what concerned himself should be read last, or words to that effect.	恺撒却表示，涉及私人问题的应放到最后再看云云。
Artemidorus begged and beseeched him to read the paper instantly!	阿特米德洛斯再三恳求恺撒，请他务必立即读材料！
—[Mark that: It is hinted by William Shakespeare, who saw the beginning and the end of the unfortunate affray, that this “schedule” was simply a note discovering to Caesar that a plot was brewing to take his life.]	——[注意：威廉·莎士比亚目睹了这一不幸动乱的始末，据他的暗示，这份“日程表”正是一封向恺撒揭发刺杀阴谋的短笺。]
—However, Caesar shook him off, and refused to read any petition in the street.	——但是，恺撒甩开阿特米德洛斯，拒绝在路上看任何请示。
He then entered the capitol, and the crowd followed him.	之后，他走进了神殿，身后的人群也跟着走了进去。
About this time the following conversation was overheard, and we consider that, taken in connection with the events which succeeded it, it bears an appalling significance: Mr. Papilius Lena remarked to George W. Cassias (commonly known as the “Nobby Boy of the Third Ward”), a bruiser in the pay of the Opposition, that he hoped his enterprise to-day might thrive; and when Cassias asked “What enterprise?” he only closed his left eye temporarily and said with simulated indifference, “Fare you well,” and sauntered toward Caesar.	这时候，有人听到下面这段对话，我们认为，将其与随后发生的事情联系起来，具有相当重大的意义：帕比留斯·利纳先生向一个受雇于反对党的彪形大汉——乔治·W. 卡西亚斯（通常被称为“第三选区的时髦小伙”）说，希望他这天的生意兴隆，但当卡西亚斯问“什么生意”时，他只是闭了一下左眼，假装没听见，说了句“你走好”，就慢悠悠地走向了恺撒。
Marcus Brutus, who is suspected of being the ringleader of the band that killed Caesar, asked what it was that Lena had said.	被人们怀疑是谋害恺撒的头号元凶的马库斯·布鲁图，正询问利纳刚才说过什么话。
Cassias told him, and added in a low tone, “I fear our purpose is discovered.”	卡西亚斯告诉了他，又压低声音补充了一句：“怕是我们的计划暴露了。”
Brutus told his wretched accomplice to keep an eye on Lena, and a moment after Cassias urged that lean and hungry vagrant, Casca, whose reputation here is none of the best, to be sudden, for he feared prevention.	布鲁图叮嘱他无耻的同谋留心利纳，不一会儿，卡西亚斯又叮嘱瘦高而贪婪的无赖卡斯卡——他在当地绝对谈不上有什么好名声，行动一定要迅速，因为他担心会有阻碍。
He then turned to Brutus, apparently much excited, and asked what should be done, and swore that either he or Caesar would never turn back—he would kill himself first.	听完后，卡斯卡明显非常兴奋，询问布鲁图应该做些什么，还发誓要么恺撒永远不再回来，要么他自己永远不再回来——他会先自杀。
At this time Caesar was talking to some of the back-country members about the approaching fall elections, and paying little attention to what was going on around him.	此时，恺撒正和来自偏远地区的元老院成员谈论着即将到来的秋季选举，全然没有察觉到自己身边发生的情况。
Billy Trebonius got into conversation with the people’s friend and Caesar’s—Mark Antony—and under some pretense or other got him away, and Brutus, Decius, Casca, Cinna, Metellus Cimber, and others of the gang of infamous desperadoes that infest Rome at present, closed around the doomed Caesar.	比利·特雷波涅斯和马克·安东尼——这位人民和恺撒共同的朋友——搭上了话，并用了不知什么借口把他支开了；布鲁图、徳西乌斯、卡斯卡、辛纳和米特勒斯·西姆伯尔以及一帮当时寄生于罗马的声名狼藉的亡命之徒，把厄运当头的恺撒给包围了。
Then Metellus Cimber knelt down and begged that his brother might be recalled from banishment, but Caesar rebuked him for his fawning conduct, and refused to grant his petition.	然后，米特勒斯·西姆伯尔屈膝跪下，求恺撒召回自己流放在外的兄弟，但是恺撒斥责了他阿谀奉承的行为，拒不同意他的请求。
Immediately, at Cimber’s request, first Brutus and then Cassias begged for the return of the banished Publius; but Caesar still refused.	随即，应西姆伯尔的请求，布鲁图和卡西亚斯轮番向恺撒请求召回被流放的普伯琉斯，但恺撒仍然拒绝答应他们的请求。
He said he could not be moved; that he was as fixed as the North Star, and proceeded to speak in the most complimentary terms of the firmness of that star and its steady character.	他说他不会被说动，就像北极星那样坚定不移，随即对北极星的执著和稳定性大加赞扬。
Then he said he was like it, and he believed he was the only man in the country that was; therefore, since he was “constant” that Cimber should be banished, he was also “constant” that he should stay banished, and he’d be hanged if he didn’t keep him so!	之后他说自己就像那颗星星，他相信这个国家也只有他一人像北极星。所以，既然他“坚定”认定西姆伯尔应该被流放，他也“坚定”认为西姆伯尔应该被继续流放，如果他不这么做，他就会被绞死！
Instantly seizing upon this shallow pretext for a fight, Casca sprang at Caesar and struck him with a dirk, Caesar grabbing him by the arm with his right hand, and launching a blow straight from the shoulder with his left, that sent the reptile bleeding to the earth.	卡斯卡立即抓住这个有些牵强的动手时机，拔出匕首扑向恺撒；恺撒用右手抓住他的胳膊，又用左手径直给了他肩膀一拳，打得那个卑鄙小人倒在地上，鲜血直流。
He then backed up against Pompey’s statue, and squared himself to receive his assailants.	然后他向后退去，背靠庞培雕像摆好姿势，准备迎接敌人的攻击。
Cassias and Cimber and Cinna rushed, upon him with their daggers drawn, and the former succeeded in inflicting a wound upon his body; but before he could strike again, and before either of the others could strike at all, Caesar stretched the three miscreants at his feet with as many blows of his powerful fist.	卡西亚斯、西姆伯尔、辛纳各自拔出匕首，一齐冲向恺撒。卡西亚斯成功地在恺撒身上划了一刀，但没等他再次行动，也没让另外两人有动手的机会，恺撒就一通铁拳出击，把三个恶棍统统撂倒在脚下。
By this time the Senate was in an indescribable uproar; the throng of citizens in the lobbies had blockaded the doors in their frantic efforts to escape from the building, the sergeant-at-arms and his assistants were struggling with the assassins, venerable senators had cast aside their encumbering robes, and were leaping over benches and flying down the aisles in wild confusion toward the shelter of the committee-rooms, and a thousand voices were shouting “Po-lice!Po-lice！”in discordant tones that rose above the frightful din like shrieking winds above the roaring of a tempest.	这时，元老院陷入一团无法形容的骚乱之中：大厅里，成群的市民堵在门口，发了疯似的想要逃出大楼；侍卫长率领部下与刺客奋力搏斗，德高望重的元老院议员纷纷把身上笨重的礼袍扔到一边，跳过长椅飞奔到走廊上，乱作一团地冲向会议室避难。人人都在喊“警察！警察！”喊声此起彼伏，在一片嘈杂声中格外刺耳，如同暴风雨肆虐时狂风的嘶鸣。
And amid it all great Caesar stood with his back against the statue, like a lion at bay, and fought his assailants weaponless and hand to hand, with the defiant bearing and the unwavering courage which he had shown before on many a bloody field.	全能伟大的恺撒虽置身喧嚣之中，仍背靠雕像挺立，像穷途末路的雄狮，空手和一个个敌人展开殊死搏斗，时刻展现出他藐视敌人的姿态和坚不可摧的勇气，正如他早已多次在残酷的战场上所展现过的那样。
Billy Trebonius and Caius Legarius struck him with their daggers and fell, as their brother-conspirators before them had fallen.	比利·特雷波涅斯、凯厄斯·莱加琉斯用匕首刺向恺撒，却被撂倒在地，和先于他们倒下的同伙一般下场。
But at last, when Caesar saw his old friend Brutus step forward armed with a murderous knife, it is said he seemed utterly overpowered with grief and amazement, and, dropping his invincible left arm by his side, he hid his face in the folds of his mantle and received the treacherous blow without an effort to stay the hand that gave it.	但是最后恺撒看到老朋友布鲁图也手持凶器走上前来时，据说他好像被痛苦与惊诧彻底击垮了；他那只无比强壮的左臂重重垂落下来，他把脸深深埋进斗篷里，不加抵抗地承受了背信弃义的一刺。
He only said, “Et tu, Brute?” and fell lifeless on the marble pavement.	他只说了句：“还有你吗，布鲁图？”说完便倒在大理石地板上没了气息。
We learn that the coat deceased had on when he was killed was the same one he wore in his tent on the afternoon of the day he overcame the Nervii, and that when it was removed from the corpse it was found to be cut and gashed in no less than seven different places.	后来我们得知，逝者遇刺那天所穿的大衣就是他征服内尔维那天下午在帐篷里穿的那一件，人们将其从死者遗体上脱下时，发现衣服上的刀痕和被刺穿的地方少说也有七处。
There was nothing in the pockets.	口袋里什么都没有。
It will be exhibited at the coroner’s inquest, and will be damning proof of the fact of the killing.	在验尸官的请求之下，这件大衣将会展出，作为这起刺杀事件的确凿证据。
These latter facts may be relied on, as we get them from Mark Antony, whose position enables him to learn every item of news connected with the one subject of absorbing interest of-to-day.	后半部分事实我们是从马克·安东尼那里得来的，因此可能更加可靠，毕竟他的职位使他能够知悉这个引起公众关注的话题的每条新闻。
LATER: While the coroner was summoning a jury, Mark Antony and other friends of the late Caesar got hold of the body, and lugged it off to the Forum, and at last accounts Antony and Brutus were making speeches over it and raising such a row among the people that, as we go to press, the chief of police is satisfied there is going to be a riot, and is taking measures accordingly.	后续：验尸官召集陪审团成员时，马克·安东尼和已故的恺撒先生的其他几位朋友抬着遗体，用力将其抬到公共广场。最新消息称安东尼和布鲁图正就此事各自发表演说，在民众中引发巨大分歧，截至发稿时为止，警局局长确信将会发生一场暴乱，正在采取相关应对措施。
