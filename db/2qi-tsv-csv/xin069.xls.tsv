Transformation of Martin Burney	马丁·伯尼的转变
by O. Henry	作者：欧·亨利
In behalf of Sir Walter’s soothing plant let us look into the case of Martin Burney.	我们代表沃尔特爵士的具有镇静作用的植物调查一下马丁·伯尼的案子。
They were constructing the Speedway along the west bank of the Harlem River.	哈勒姆河西岸正在铺设一条高速公路。
The grub-boat of Dennis Corrigan, sub-contractor, was moored to a tree on the bank.	分包商丹尼斯·科里根的伙食船系在岸边的一棵树上。
Twenty-two men belonging to the little green island toiled there at the sinew-cracking labour.	来自小绿岛的22个人在那里干着令人筋疲力尽的工作。
One among them, who wrought in the kitchen of the grub-boat was of the race of the Goths.	其中一个人在伙食船厨房里干活，他是个哥特人。
Over them all stood the exorbitant Corrigan, harrying them like the captain of a galley crew.	指挥他们的是飞扬跋扈的科里根，他像苦役船的船长似的折磨他们。
He paid them so little that most of the gang, work as they might, earned little more than food and tobacco; many of them were in debt to him.	他付给大家的工资少得可怜，他们拼命干活，挣的也只够吃饭和买烟草，许多人都欠他的债。
Corrigan boarded them all in the grub-boat, and gave them good grub, for he got it back in work.	科里根让大家在伙食船里吃饭，给他们提供很好的伙食，因为他可以从他们干的活里捞回来。
Martin Burney was furthest behind of all.	马丁·伯尼排在这帮人的最后。
He was a little man, all muscles and hands and feet, with a gray-red, stubbly beard.	他是一个肌肉结实、四肢发达的小个子男人，长着粗短的灰红色胡子。
He was too light for the work, which would have glutted the capacity of a steam shovel.	对他来说，干这种蒸汽挖掘机似的活似乎还单薄了些。
The work was hard.	工作非常辛苦。
Besides that, the banks of the river were humming with mosquitoes.	除此之外，河岸上的蚊子成群。
As a child in a dark room fixes his regard on the pale light of a comforting window, these toilers watched the sun that brought around the one hour of the day that tasted less bitter.	这些劳工就像黑屋子里的小孩子，盯着从窗口射来的苍白光线，以此寻求慰藉，盼着太阳给他们带来一天中不那么苦涩的一小时。
After the sundown supper they would huddle together on the river bank, and send the mosquitoes whining and eddying back from the malignant puffs of twenty-three reeking pipes.	晚饭后，他们拥坐在河边，点起23支烟斗，吞云吐雾，熏得蚊子嗡嗡直叫，如潮水般退去。
Thus socially banded against the foe, they wrenched out of the hour a few well-smoked drops from the cup of joy.	于是他们同仇敌忾，从那一小时中挤出几滴烟雾缭绕的欢乐。
Each week Burney grew deeper in debt.	伯尼欠的债一周比一周多。
Corrigan kept a small stock of goods on the boat, which he sold to the men at prices that brought him no loss.	科里根在船上备置了一些货物，以有赚无赔的价格卖给工人们。
Burney was a good customer at the tobacco counter.	伯尼是烟草柜台的老顾客。
One sack when he went to work in the morning and one when he came in at night, so much was his account swelled daily.	他早晨出工时抽一袋，晚上收工时再抽一袋，赊账的数额与日俱增。
Burney was something of a smoker.	伯尼可说得上是个烟民。
Yet it was not true that he ate his meals with a pipe in his mouth, which had been said of him.	有人说他吃饭时也叼着烟斗，这当然是夸大其词。
The little man was not discontented.	这个小个子并没有感到不满。
He had plenty to eat, plenty of tobacco, and a tyrant to curse; so why should not he, an Irishman, be well satisfied?	他有足够的东西吃，足够的烟抽，还有一个专横的包工头可以诅咒，作为爱尔兰人，他还有什么不满意的呢？
One morning as he was starting with the others for work he stopped at the pine counter for his usual sack of tobacco.	一天早晨，他和别人一起出工时，在松木柜台前停了下来，像往常一样买一袋烟草。
“There’s no more for ye,” said Corrigan.	“不再卖给你了，”科里根说，
“Your account’s closed.	“已经给你销户了。
Ye are a losing investment.	你是亏本的投资。
No, not even tobaccy, my son.	不，没有烟草了，伙计。
No more tobaccy on account.	不能赊给你烟草了。
If ye want to work on and eat, do so, but the smoke of ye has all ascended.	如果你想干活吃饭，那就接着干，但是烟草不给你了。
’Tis my advice that ye hunt a new job.”	我劝你再找一份新工作。”
“I have no tobaccy to smoke in my pipe this day, Mr. Corrigan,” said Burney, not quite understanding that such a thing could happen to him.	“今天，我的烟斗里没烟草了，科里根先生。”伯尼说道，他还不明白这件事为什么会发生在他身上。
“Earn it,” said Corrigan, “and then buy it.”	“挣了钱，”科里根说，“再来买。”
Burney stayed on.	伯尼留了下来。
He knew of no other job.	他不了解还有什么其他的工作。
At first he did not realize that tobacco had got to be his father and mother, his confessor and sweetheart, and wife and child.	起初，他并没有意识到烟草竟会成为他的父母、告解神父和情人以及他的妻儿。
For three days he managed to fill his pipe from the other men’s sacks, and then they shut him off, one and all.	三天来，他想方设法从别人的烟袋里搞到烟草装进自己的烟斗，但随后所有的人都断绝了对他的施舍。
They told him, rough but friendly, that of all things in the world tobacco must be quickest forthcoming to a fellow-man desiring it, but that beyond the immediate temporary need requisition upon the store of a comrade is pressed with great danger to friendship.	他们粗暴而友好地告诉他，在世上所有的东西当中，烟草是需要的人最快能从别人那里得到的。但是超过临时的需求，总是征用别人的储备，会给友谊造成极大的危险。
Then the blackness of the pit arose and filled the heart of Burney.	此时，地狱的黑气升腾上来，充斥着伯尼的心。
Sucking the corpse of his deceased dudheen, he staggered through his duties with his barrowful of stones and dirt, feeling for the first time that the curse of Adam was upon him.	他干抽着那断气的瓷烟斗，踉踉跄跄地推着一车车石头和泥土，第一次感到亚当的诅咒落到了他的头上。
Other men bereft of a pleasure might have recourse to other delights, but Burney had only two comforts in life.	当别人失去了一种乐趣时，可能还可以找别的乐趣，然而伯尼的生活中只有两个安慰。
One was his pipe, the other was an ecstatic hope that there would be no Speedways to build on the other side of Jordan.	一个是他的烟斗，另一个是痴迷地希望约旦河彼岸不会铺设高速公路。
At meal times he would let the other men go first into the grub-boat, and then he would go down on his hands and knees, grovelling fiercely upon the ground where they had been sitting, trying to find some stray crumbs of tobacco.	到了就餐时间，他让别人先去伙食船，然后，他手脚并用地在他们刚才坐的地上爬来爬去，拼命搜寻散落的烟草碎屑。
Once he sneaked down the river bank and filled his pipe with dead willow leaves.	有一次，他溜到河岸边，把干枯的柳树叶塞进烟斗。
At the first whiff of the smoke he spat in the direction of the boat and put the finest curse he knew on Corrigan—one that began with the first Corrigans born on earth and ended with the Corrigans that shall hear the trumpet of Gabriel blow.	他刚抽了一口，就朝伙食船的方向狠吐唾沫，用他能想到的最贴切的诅咒大骂科里根——从科里根的第一代祖先开始，一直骂到将会听到最后审判号角声的科里根的末代子孙。
He began to hate Corrigan with all his shaking nerves and soul.	他全身神经和灵魂都震颤着，开始憎恨起科里根。
Even murder occurred to him in a vague sort of way.	他甚至模模糊糊地起了谋杀的念头。
Five days he went without the taste of tobacco—he who had smoked all day and thought the night misspent in which he had not awakened for a pipeful or two under the bedclothes.	他五天没碰过烟了——原先他整天抽烟，就连夜里醒来也要在被窝里抽上一两袋，不然就觉得那晚是虚度光阴了。
One day a man stopped at the boat to say that there was work to be had in the Bronx Park, where a large number of labourers were required in making some improvements.	一天，有个人来到了船上，说是布朗克斯公园要有一些改建工程，需要大批劳力。
After dinner Burney walked thirty yards down the river bank away from the maddening smell of the others’ pipes.	晚饭后，伯尼沿着河岸走了30码路，躲开别人烟斗发出的那令他发狂的气味。
He sat down upon a stone.	他坐在一块石头上。
He was thinking he would set out for the Bronx.	他在考虑是不是应该去布朗克斯。
At least he could earn tobacco there.	至少他能在那里挣到烟草的钱。
What if the books did say he owed Corrigan?	假如账本上说他欠科里根的债怎么办？
Any man’s work was worth his keep.	任何人干活都能混得出生活费来。
But then he hated to go without getting even with the hard-hearted screw who had put his pipe out.	那个铁石心肠的吝啬鬼灭了他的烟斗，不报复他就离开，实在不甘心。
Was there any way to do it?	有什么方法可以报复呢？
Softly stepping among the clods came Tony, he of the race of Goths, who worked in the kitchen.	在厨房干活的哥特人托尼轻手轻脚地从泥路上走了过来。
He grinned at Burney’s elbow, and that unhappy man, full of race animosity and holding urbanity in contempt, growled at him: “What d’ye want, ye—Dago?”	他走到伯尼身边笑了笑，心里本来就有气的伯尼充满了种族仇恨，毫不客气地冲他嚷道：“你想干什么，你——意大利佬？”
Tony also contained a grievance—and a plot.	托尼也满肚子怨气——和阴谋。
He, too, was a Corrigan hater, and had been primed to see it in others.	他也恨科里根，也早就看出别人对科里根的憎恨。
“How you like-a Mr. Corrigan?” he asked.	“你觉得科里根这个人怎么样？”他问道，
“You think-a him a nice-a man?”	“你觉得他是个好人吗？”
“To hell with ’m,” he said.	“让他见鬼去吧，”他说，
“May his liver turn to water, and the bones of him crack in the cold of his heart.	“但愿他的肝脏化成水，他的骨头被他冰冷的心冻裂。
May dog fennel grow upon his ancestors’ graves, and the grandsons of his children be born without eyes.	但愿他的祖坟上长满臭甘菊，他儿女的孙子一生下来就没有眼睛。
May whiskey turn to clabber in his mouth, and every time he sneezes may he blister the soles of his feet.	但愿威士忌一到他嘴里就变酸，他每打一个喷嚏，脚底就长一个水疱。
And the smoke of his pipe—may it make his eyes water, and the drops fall on the grass that his cows eat and poison the butter that he spreads on his bread.”	但愿他烟斗里的烟熏得他流泪，泪水滴在他家牛吃的草上面，把他抹在面包上的黄油变成毒药。”
Though Tony remained a stranger to the beauties of this imagery, he gathered from it the conviction that it was sufficiently anti-Corrigan in its tendency.	尽管托尼欣赏不了这种比喻的妙处，但他确实从中听出了深深的反科里根倾向。
So, with the confidence of a fellow-conspirator, he sat by Burney upon the stone and unfolded his plot.	他像一个推心置腹的同谋一样，坐在伯尼身旁的石头上，透露了他的计划。
It was very simple in design.	计划十分简单。
Every day after dinner it was Corrigan’s habit to sleep for an hour in his bunk.	科里根有个习惯，就是每天午饭后都要在他的床铺上睡一个小时。
At such times it was the duty of the cook and his helper, Tony, to leave the boat so that no noise might disturb the autocrat.	这时候，厨师和他的助手托尼必须离开伙食船，以免弄出声音吵到那个独裁者。
The cook always spent this hour in walking exercise.	厨师总是利用这一个小时去散步。
Tony’s plan was this: After Corrigan should be asleep he (Tony) and Burney would cut the mooring ropes that held the boat to the shore.	托尼的计划是这样的：科里根睡着后，他（托尼）和伯尼就割断把船拴在岸上的缆绳。
Tony lacked the nerve to do the deed alone.	托尼没有胆量单独做这件事。
Then the awkward boat would swing out into a swift current and surely overturn against a rock there was below.	失去缆绳的船会在急流中漂走，一定会撞到下游的礁石而倾覆。
“Come on and do it,” said Burney.	“好啊，就这么干，”伯尼说，
“If the back of ye aches from the lick he gave ye as the pit of me stomach does for the taste of a bit of smoke, we can’t cut the ropes too quick.”	“你挨过他的打，余痛未消，我因为抽不到烟而百爪挠心，我们还不快去割断缆绳。”
“All a-right,” said Tony.	“好，”托尼说，
“But better wait ’bout-a ten minute more.	“不过最好再等十分钟。
Give-a Corrigan plenty time get good-a sleep.”	让科里根睡得熟一点儿。”
They waited, sitting upon the stone.	他们坐在石头上等着。
The rest of the men were at work out of sight around a bend in the road.	剩下的人在公路拐弯那头干活，看不见。
Everything would have gone well—except, perhaps, with Corrigan, had not Tony been moved to decorate the plot with its conventional accompaniment.	若非托尼一时兴起，想用传统的方式给计划增添一些色彩，这个对付科里根的计划会无比顺利。
He was of dramatic blood, and perhaps he intuitively divined the appendage to villainous machinations as prescribed by the stage.	他有戏剧气质，也许不由自主地想到舞台上表现险恶阴谋时应该加点儿花絮。
He pulled from his shirt bosom a long, black, beautiful, venomous cigar, and handed it to Burney.	他从衬衣的内衬里掏出一支长长的、漂亮而又充满仇恨的黑雪茄烟，递给伯尼。
“You like-a smoke while we wait?” he asked.	“我们等着的时候，你想抽支烟吗？”他问道。
Burney clutched it and snapped off the end as a terrier bites at a rat.	伯尼抓住雪茄，像猎狗咬耗子似的咬掉一端。
He laid it to his lips like a long-lost sweetheart.	他把它叼在嘴里，那样子像是见到了久别重逢的情人。
When the smoke began to draw he gave a long, deep sigh, and the bristles of his gray-red moustache curled down over the cigar like the talons of an eagle.	他抽了一口，舒了一口长气，灰红色的粗硬胡子像鹰爪似地卷住雪茄。
Slowly the red faded from the whites of his eyes.	他眼球上的血丝逐渐消退。
He fixed his gaze dreamily upon the hills across the river.	他迷迷糊糊地凝视着河对面的山峦。
The minutes came and went.	时间一分一秒地过去。
“‘Bout time to go now,” said Tony.	“现在该走了，”托尼说，
“That damn-a Corrigan he be in the reever very quick.”	“那个该死的科里根很快就会沉到河里了。”
Burney started out of his trance with a grunt.	伯尼咕哝了一下，从恍惚中惊醒过来。
He turned his head and gazed with a surprised and pained severity at his accomplice.	他转过头，惊讶又极其严肃地看着他的同谋。
He took the cigar partly from his mouth, but sucked it back again immediately, chewed it lovingly once or twice, and spoke, in virulent puffs, from the corner of his mouth:	他拿开嘴边的雪茄，立马又放回去，爱抚地咬了一两口，嘴角狠狠地喷着烟：
“What is it, ye yaller haythen?	“你这个卑鄙的异教徒，怎么啦？
Would ye lay contrivances against the enlightened races of the earth, ye instigator of illegal crimes?	你这个罪恶勾当的唆使犯，难道你要对地球上文明的种族搞阴谋诡计？
Would ye seek to persuade Martin Burney into the dirty tricks of an indecent Dago?	难道你要唆使马丁·伯尼参与你这个下流的意大利佬的邪恶诡计？
Would ye be for murderin’ your benefactor, the good man that gives ye food and work?	难道你要谋杀你的恩人，那个给你饭吃、给你工作的好人？
Take that, ye punkin-coloured assassin!”	去你的吧，你这个长着南瓜色皮肤的杀人犯！”
The torrent of Burney’s indignation carried with it bodily assault.	除了一连串愤怒的言语，伯尼还加上了身体的攻击。
The toe of his shoe sent the would-be cutter of ropes tumbling from his seat.	他一脚把那割绳未遂的人从坐着的石头上踢翻在地。
Tony arose and fled.	托尼爬起来就逃。
His vendetta he again relegated to the files of things that might have been.	他再一次把仇杀存入可能发生的事件的档案。
Beyond the boat he fled and away-away; he was afraid to remain.	他跑过伙食船，继续跑得很远很远，他不敢逗留。
Burney, with expanded chest, watched his late co-plotter disappear.	伯尼挺起胸膛，看见他的前任同谋跑得没有了踪迹。
Then he, too, departed, setting his face in the direction of the Bronx.	然后他也离开了，朝布朗克斯走去。
In his wake was a rank and pernicious trail of noisome smoke that brought peace to his heart and drove the birds from the roadside into the deepest thickets.	他身后留下一股恶臭而有害的烟雾，把路边的鸟赶进了浓密的树丛，但给他的内心带来了平静。
