"Part I","第一卷"
"“No retreat, no retreat.They must conquer or die Who have no retreat!”","“没有退路，没有退路。没有退路的人必须获胜，否则就是死路一条！”"
"Mr. Gay.","盖伊先生"
"Chapter I","第一章"
"Promenade","散步"
"Coming down the steps of ‘Snooks’ Club, so nicknamed by George Forsyte in the late eighties, on that momentous mid-October afternoon of 1922, Sir Lawrence Mont, ninth baronet, set his fine nose towards the east wind, and moved his thin legs with speed.","1922年10月中旬的那个重要的下午，第九代准男爵劳伦斯·蒙特爵士迎着东风翘着俊美的鼻子，迈着两条细腿疾步走下“轻蔑”俱乐部的台阶——俱乐部这一绰号出自上世纪80年代末乔治·福赛特之口。"
"Political by birth rather than by nature, he reviewed the revolution which had restored his Party to power with a detachment not devoid of humour.","他虽出生于政治世家，却对政治不感兴趣，提起他所在的政党重夺政权的那次革命，他只是轻描淡写。"
"Passing the Remove Club, he thought: ‘Some sweating into shoes, there!","路过利姆夫俱乐部时，他想：“这次麻烦啦！"
"No more confectioned dishes.","再也没有甜点可吃啦。"
"A woodcock—without trimmings, for a change!’","山鹬没有了配料，得变口味喽！”"
"The captains and the kings had departed from ‘Snooks’ before he entered it, for he was not of ‘that catch-penny crew, now paid off, no sir; fellows who turned their tails on the land the moment the war was over. Pah!’","在他进入“轻蔑”俱乐部之前，那些大老板和王公贵族们早已离开，因为他并不属于“想方设法捞钱，而且已经捞个够本的那帮家伙，他绝不是那种人——那帮家伙在战争刚刚结束时就丢弃家园逃之夭夭了。呸！”"
"But for an hour he had listened to echoes, and his lively twisting mind, embedded in deposits of the past, sceptical of the present and of all political protestations and pronouncements, had recorded with amusement the confusion of patriotism and personalities left behind by the fateful gathering.","可是对过去忘事的回忆，他足足听了一个小时。他的大脑活跃地转动着，牢记往事，怀疑当下，也怀疑一切政治主张和声明。他饶有兴致地记录了这次意义重大的集会上所留下的爱国主义和个体攻击的混乱。"
"Like most landowners, he distrusted doctrine.","和大部分地主一样，他不相信教条。"
"If he had a political belief, it was a tax on wheat; and so far as he could see, he was now alone in it—but then he was not seeking election; in other words, his principle was not in danger of extinction from the votes of those who had to pay for bread.","如果非要说他有政治信仰的话，那就是征收小麦税了，并且就他所知，他势单力薄——但是，对他来说，选票不重要；换句话说，平民百姓的选票威胁不到他笃信的原则。"
"Principles—he mused—au fond were pocket; and he wished the deuce people wouldn’t pretend they weren’t!","原则——他沉思着——就是钱罢了。他真希望人们不要再装作不承认这一点了！"
"Pocket, in the deep sense of that word, of course, self-interest as member of a definite community.","当然，从深层含义来讲，钱无非就是特定社会群体成员的个人利益。"
"And how the devil was this definite community, the English nation, to exist, when all its land was going out of cultivation, and all its ships and docks in danger of destruction by aeroplanes?","而当它所有的土地都荒芜，所有的船只和港口都面临被飞机炸毁的危险时，这个特定社会群体——英国民族，倒是有什么办法生存下去啊？"
"He had listened that hour past for a single mention of the land.","在一个小时的倾听中，他希望听到有人谈及土地。"
"Not one!","竟无一人谈及！"
"It was not practical politics!","这根本不是实用政治！"
"Confound the fellows!","这帮该死的家伙！"
"They had to wear their breeches out—keeping seats or getting them.","他们不惜磨破了裤子——就为了保住席位或获得席位。"
"No connection between posteriors and posterity!","丝毫没考虑过子孙后代！"
"No, by George!","的确没有！"
"Thus reminded of posterity, it occurred to him rather suddenly that his son’s wife showed no signs as yet.","说起后代，他突然想起自己的儿媳至今还没有一点点的喜照。"
"Two years!","两年了！"
"Time they were thinking about children.","该是要孩子的时候了。"
"It was dangerous to get into the habit of not having them, when a title and estate depended.","不要孩子如果成为一种习惯，对于那些有爵位或是需要产业继承人的家庭来说是相当可怕的。"
"A smile twisted his lips and eyebrows which resembled spinneys of dark pothooks.","一丝微笑牵动了他的双唇和眉毛，那两道弯眉异常浓密。"
"A pretty young creature, most taking; and knew it, too!","一个漂亮的小孩，非常可爱，而且她也深知这一点啊！"
"Whom was she not getting to know?","有谁她不想去认识呢？"
"Lions and tigers, monkeys and cats—her house was becoming quite a menagerie of more or less celebrities.","狮子、老虎、猴子和猫——她的家成了这些大小名人的动物园了。"
"There was a certain unreality about that sort of thing!","这种事情总是有种不真实的感觉！"
"And opposite a British lion in Trafalgar Square Sir Lawrence thought: ‘She’ll be getting these to her house next!","劳伦斯爵士站在特拉法尔加广场上的一只不列颠之狮的对面，心里想：“下次她会把这些都弄到家里去！"
"She’s got the collecting habit.","她染上收藏的嗜好了。"
"Michael must look out—in a collector’s house there’s always a lumber room for old junk, and husbands are liable to get into it.","迈克尔必须小心了——收藏家的家里肯定有一间专门放置破旧货的储藏室，而丈夫是很容易被关进去的。"
"That reminds me: I promised her a Chinese Minister.","这倒提醒了我：我曾答应给她介绍一位中国公使。"
"Well, she must wait now till after the General Election.’","好吧，如今她得等到大选过后了。”"
"Down Whitehall, under the grey easterly sky, the towers of Westminster came for a second into view.","沿着白厅大街往南走，在东方灰色的天空下，威斯敏斯特教堂的塔楼瞬间映入眼帘。"
"‘A certain unreality in that, too,’ he thought.","“那里面似乎也有种不真实的东西，”他想，"
"‘Michael and his fads!","“迈克尔和他的狂热爱好！"
"Well, it’s the fashion—Socialistic principles and a rich wife.","哦，这的确是一种时尚——社会主义的原则和一个富有的妻子。"
"Sacrifice with safety!","有所牺牲但又很安全！"
"Peace with plenty!","和平且富足！"
"Nostrums—ten a penny!’","万能灵药——一便士十粒！"
"Passing the newspaper hubbub of Charing Cross, frenzied by the political crisis, he turned up to the left towards Danby and Winter, publishers, where his son was junior partner.","查林十字广场上买卖报纸的喧哗由于这次政治危机变得更加嘈杂。他穿过广场向左拐，朝丹比&温特出版社走去，他的儿子是那里的第二合伙人。"
"A new theme for a book had just begun to bend a mind which had already produced a ‘Life of Montrose,’ ‘Far Cathay,’ that work of Eastern travel, and a fanciful conversation between the shades of Gladstone and Disraeli—entitled ‘A Duet.’","他已经出版了《蒙特罗斯传》一书、一部东方游记《遥远的契丹》以及《二重唱》。《二重唱》是描述格莱斯顿和迪斯雷利两个幽灵之间的幻想谈话。如今他又开始专心筹备新书了。"
"With every step taken, from ‘Snooks’ eastward, his erect thin figure in Astrakhan-collared coat, his thin grey-moustached face, and tortoise-shell rimmed monocle under the lively dark eyebrow, had seemed more rare.","他身材挺拔细长，身着阿斯特拉罕皮领外衣，瘦削的脸上留着灰白胡子，生动的浓眉下架着玳瑁边的单片眼镜。他从“轻蔑”俱乐部出来往东走，每走一步，都显得更加与众不同。"
"It became almost a phenomenon in this dingy back street, where carts stuck like winter flies, and persons went by with books under their arms, as if educated.","在这条肮脏的后街上，车辆犹如冬天里的苍蝇一般紧挨着，人们夹着书本穿梭其中，看上去似乎很有学问。在这里，像他这样的人物极为引人注目。","像他这样的人物极为引人注目 翻译不准确"
"He had nearly reached the door of Danby’s when he encountered two young men.","快到丹比出版社时，他遇到了两位年轻人。"
"One of them was clearly his son, better dressed since his marriage, and smoking a cigar—thank goodness—instead of those eternal cigarettes; the other—ah! yes—Michael’s sucking poet and best man, head in air, rather a sleek head under a velour hat!","其中一位很明显是他的儿子。自从结婚后，他儿子的打扮比以前讲究一些了，这会儿正吸着一支雪茄——谢天谢地——吸的不是那种没完没了的烟卷；另一位——啊，没错——是迈克尔不成气候的诗人朋友和结婚时的男傧相，他头昂得高高的，活像个油头滑脑的家伙！"
"He said:","他说道："
"“Ha, Michael!”","“嗨，迈克尔！”"
"“HALLO, Bart!","“你好，准爵爷！"
"You know my governor, Wilfrid?","威尔弗里德，你认识我爸爸吧？"
"Wilfrid Desert.","这是威尔弗里德·德赛特。"

"“Bart was brought up, Wilfrid, in days that knew not Demos.”","“威尔弗里德，准爵爷是在不了解民众的时代长大的。”"
"“Well, Mr. Desert, do you find reality in politics now?”","“哦，德赛特先生，您觉得如今的政治现实可行吗？”"
"“Do you find reality in anything, sir?”","“先生，您在哪些方面发现它现实可行呢？”"
"“In income tax, perhaps.”","“或许是在所得税方面。”"
"Michael grinned.","迈克尔咧嘴笑了。"
"“Above knighthood,” he said, “there’s no such thing as simple faith.”","“地位在爵士以上的人，”他说道，“单纯的信仰对他们而言根本不存在。”"
"“Suppose your friends came into power, Michael—in some ways not a bad thing, help ‘em to grow up—what could they do, eh?","“假设你的朋友掌权，迈克尔——在某些方面，这其实并不是一件坏事，帮助他们发展起来——他们又能干些什么呢？"

"Or do anything, in fact, but alter the incidence of possession a little?","或者，除了稍微改变一点儿占有欲的问题，还能做点儿其他的什么吗？"
"All party politics are top dressing.","一切党派政治都善于浮华的装饰。"
"We’re ruled by the inventors, and human nature; and we live in Queer Street, Mr. Desert.”","我们受到制定规则的人和人性的支配，并且我们经济上陷入了困境，德赛特先生。”"
"“Much my sentiments, sir.”","“我也深有同感，先生。”"
"Michael flourished his cigar.","迈克尔晃了晃他手中的雪茄。"
"“Bad old men, you two!”","“难缠的人啊，你们二位呀！”"
"And removing their hats, they passed the Cenotaph.","经过纪念碑时，他们都脱下帽子。"
"“Curiously symptomatic—that thing,” said Sir Lawrence; “monument to the dread of swank—most characteristic.","“非常有代表性——那个东西，”劳伦斯爵士说，“害怕出风头的纪念碑——这说法真准确。"
"And the dread of swank—”","说到害怕出风头——”"
"“Go on, Bart,” said Michael.","“准爵爷，说下去。”迈克尔说道。"
"“The fine, the large, the florid—all off!","“一切优雅、博大、华丽的事物——全都消失了！"
"No far-sighted views, no big schemes, no great principles, no great religion, or great art—aestheticism in cliques and backwaters, small men in small hats.”","没有远见的卓识，没有宏伟的规划，没有高尚的原则，没有崇高的信仰，没有伟大的艺术——只有沉湎于小派系和穷乡僻壤里的唯美主义，和一些鼠目寸光的小人物而已。”"
"“As panteth the heart after Byron, Wilberforce, and the Nelson Monument.","“所以人心切慕拜伦、威尔伯福斯以及纳尔逊纪念碑。"

"“We all kick up for freedom, and the only institutions gaining strength are Socialism and the Roman Catholic Church.","“我们都高喊着要自由，但只有社会主义和罗马天主教会真正受益。"

"We’re nuts on peace—and all we’re doing about it is to perfect poison gas.”","我们热爱和平——但我们实际为和平所做的却是造出了毒气。”"

"“And how’s publishing, Michael?”","“迈克尔，出版社情况如何？”"
"“Well, ‘Copper Coin’ is selling like hot cakes; and there’s quite a movement in ‘A Duet.’","“嗯，《铜币》正在热销，《二重唱》销量也很可观。"

"They had come, however, to a policeman holding up his hand against the nose of a van horse, so that everything marked time.","然而此时，他们走到了一位警察身边，警察正举手拦住一辆运货马车，因此所有车辆和行人都停止不前了。"
"The engines of the cars whirred idly, their drivers’ faces set towards the space withheld from them; a girl on a bicycle looked vacantly about her, grasping the back of the van, where a youth sat sideways with his legs stretched out towards her.","汽车的发动机轰轰作响，司机们面目呆滞，凝视着前方被封住的路；一个骑自行车的女孩茫然环顾四周，一手抓住那辆货车的尾部，一个青年侧坐在车上，两条腿直伸着对着她。"
"Sir Lawrence glanced again at young Desert.","劳伦斯爵士又朝年轻的德赛特瞥了一眼。"
"A thin, pale-dark face, good-looking, but a hitch in it, as if not properly timed; nothing outre in dress or manner, and yet socially at large; less vivacious than that lively rascal, his own son, but as anchorless, and more sceptical—might feel things pretty deeply, though!","一张消瘦、浅黑色的脸庞，外貌英俊，但似乎缺少点儿什么，显得有些美中不足；穿戴和举止还算得体，肯定在社交上游刃有余；不如他那个活泼的儿子那么有生气，但一样不安定，而且更多疑——不过他对事物的看法倒是相当深刻！"

"“Yes?”","“您请讲？”"
"“Tennyson, Browning, Wordsworth, Swinburne—they could turn it out; ils vivaient, mais si peu.”","“丁尼生、勃朗宁、华兹华斯、斯温伯恩——他们都能创造出诗歌，但他们却很少经历过你说的那两种生活。”"

"Chapter II","第二章"
"Home","家"
"The house in South Square, Westminster, to which the young Monts had come after their Spanish honeymoon two years before, might have been called ‘emancipated.’","坐落在威斯敏斯特南广场的这幢房子是“解放式”的。两年前，年轻的蒙特夫妇在西班牙度完蜜月，回到了这里。"
"It was the work of an architect whose dream was a new house perfectly old, and an old house perfectly new.","设计它的那位建筑师梦想建造一幢完全古式的新房子和一幢全然一新的老房子。"
"It followed, therefore, no recognised style or tradition, and was devoid of structural prejudice; but it soaked up the smuts of the metropolis with such special rapidity that its stone already respectably resembled that of Wren.","因此，这幢房子并不循规蹈矩，也不墨守结构上的陈规，但它却以惊人的速度收集了这个大都市的煤尘，连砖块也已经快赶上雷恩设计的典雅的建筑物砖块了。"
"Its windows and doors had gently rounded tops.","房子的门窗都有圆润的穹顶。"
"The high-sloping roof, of a fine sooty pink, was almost Danish, and two ‘ducky little windows’ looked out of it, giving an impression that very tall servants lived up there.","高斜的屋顶刷着雅致的暗红色，很有丹麦的风格，上面的两扇“玲珑小窗”从屋顶往外探，让人以为上面住着一些魁梧的仆人。"
"There were rooms on each side of the front door, which was wide and set off by bay trees in black and gold bindings.","前门处很宽敞，装饰着金色和黑色的月桂树，门两侧各有几间房间。"
"The house was thick through, and the staircase, of a broad chastity, began at the far end of a hall which had room for quite a number of hats and coats and cards.","房子很深，宽大、典雅的楼梯从门厅尽头开始延伸，门厅很宽敞，足可以放下很多的帽子、大衣和卡片。"
"There were four bathrooms; and not even a cellar underneath.","房子里有四间盥洗室，却没有一间地下室。"
"The Forsyte instinct for a house had co-operated in its acquisition.","福赛特家族善于甄别房屋的天赋帮助他们买下了这座房子。"
"Soames had picked it up for his daughter, undecorated, at that psychological moment when the bubble of inflation was pricked, and the air escaping from the balloon of the world’s trade.","索姆斯是在极为恰当的时候为女儿挑选了这幢还未装修的房子，当时通货膨胀的气泡刚被戳破，世界贸易的大气球正在漏气。"
"Fleur, however, had established immediate contact with the architect—an element which Soames himself had never quite got over—and decided not to have more than three styles in her house: Chinese, Spanish, and her own.","可是，弗勒早已直接跟建筑师联系了——这恰是索姆斯自己不太具备的能力——并且决定在装修她的房子时仅限于三种风格：中国式、西班牙式以及自己独特的风格。"
"The room to the left of the front door, running the breadth of the house, was Chinese, with ivory panels, a copper floor, central heating, and cut glass lustres.","前门左侧的房间和房子的跨度一样宽，是中国式的，镶嵌着象牙色的护墙板，铺着红棕色地板，装有中央暖气，还有雕花玻璃吊灯。"
"It contained four pictures—all Chinese—the only school in which her father had not yet dabbled.","屋内挂着四幅画——都是中国国画——这是她父亲至今唯一没有尝试的画派。"
"The fireplace, wide and open, had Chinese dogs with Chinese tiles for them to stand on.","壁炉宽大开阔，底部镶有中国瓷砖，瓷砖上镶着中国狗的图案。"
"The silk was chiefly of jade green.","丝绸以翠绿色的居多。"
"There were two wonderful old black tea-chests, picked up with Soames’ money at Jobson’s—not a bargain.","屋内有两个古色古香的黑色茶柜，它们是索姆斯从乔布森拍卖行花钱买来的——绝不是廉价品。"
"There was no piano, partly because pianos were too uncompromisingly occidental, and partly because it would have taken up much room.","屋内没有钢琴，其一是因为钢琴带有西洋韵味，风格很不协调，其二是由于它占的空间太大。"
"Fleur aimed at space-collecting people rather than furniture or bibelots.","弗勒希望有空间来招待宾客，而不是收纳家具或者装饰品。"
"The light, admitted by windows at both ends, was unfortunately not Chinese.","可惜的是，从屋内两端窗户透进的光线不是中国的。"
"She would stand sometimes in the centre of this room, thinking—how to ‘bunch’ her guests, how to make her room more Chinese without making it uncomfortable; how to seem to know all about literature and politics; how to accept everything her father gave her, without making him aware that his taste had no sense of the future; how to keep hold of Sibley Swan, the new literary star, and to get hold of Gurdon Minho, the old; of how Wilfrid Desert was getting too fond of her; of what was really her style in dress; of why Michael had such funny ears; and sometimes she stood not thinking at all—just aching a little.","有时她会站在房子中间，思量着——该如何“汇拢”她的那些客人呢；该如何使她的房间更显中国化而又不失舒适呢；该如何显得自己精通文学和政治呢；该如何接纳父亲给予自己的一切，同时还让父亲察觉不到他的兴趣已跟不上潮流呢；该如何同时抓住文坛新秀西布莉·斯旺和文学泰斗格登·明霍呢；威尔弗里德·德赛特是如何越来越迷恋她呢；她的衣着究竟应该是什么风格呢，还有迈克尔为何长着一副如此滑稽的耳朵呢。但有时她站在那里，什么也不想——只是有一点点心痛。"
"When those three came in she was sitting before a red lacquer tea-table, finishing a very good tea.","当那三人走进来时，弗勒正坐在一张红漆茶桌前，刚刚吃完精致的茶点。"
"She always had tea brought in rather early, so that she could have a good quiet preliminary ‘tuck-in’ all by herself, because she was not quite twenty-one, and this was her hour for remembering her youth.","她总是吩咐仆人把茶点早一些送过来，这样一来，她便可以独自一人悠然自得地享受“一顿美餐”，因为她还未满21岁，而这正是她记住青春岁月的大好时候。"
"By her side Ting-a-ling was standing on his hind feet, his tawny forepaws on a Chinese footstool, his snubbed black and tawny muzzle turned up towards the fruits of his philosophy.","小叮铃正踮着后脚站在她身旁，它那黄褐色的前爪搁在一把中国式的脚凳上，那扁平的黑褐色口鼻朝上仰着，望着他眼中的“果子”。"
"“That’ll do, Ting.","“好了，叮铃。"
"No more, ducky!","没了，宝贝！"
"NO MORE!”","一点儿也没有了！”"
"The expression of Ting-a-ling answered:","小叮铃的表情仿佛回答道："
"‘Well, then, stop, too!","“哦，那你也别吃了！"
"Don’t subject me to torture!’","别再折磨我了！”"
"A year and three months old, he had been bought by Michael out of a Bond Street shop window on Fleur’s twentieth birthday, eleven months ago.","它一岁零三个月，是11个月前，迈克尔在弗勒20岁生日那天，从邦德大街的一家商店橱窗里买来的。"
"Two years of married life had not lengthened her short dark chestnut hair; had added a little more decision to her quick lips, a little more allurement to her white-lidded, dark-lashed hazel eyes, a little more poise and swing to her carriage, a little more chest and hip measurement; had taken a little from waist and calf measurement, a little colour from cheeks a little less round, and a little sweetness from a voice a little more caressing.","两年的婚姻生活，没有使她深栗色的短发变长，却让她那灵巧的嘴唇多了一份坚决神情，让那双白眼皮、黑睫毛、淡褐色的眼睛更加妩媚，给她的仪态平添了几分端庄和婀娜。她的胸围和臀部愈加丰满，腰身和小腿愈加纤细；她的面庞愈加清瘦，少了几分血色；她嗓音没有以前甜美了，却多了一丝柔情。"
"She stood up behind the tray, holding out her white round arm without a word.","她从茶盘后面站起来，一语不发地伸出她那白皙而丰润的手臂。"
"She avoided unnecessary greetings or farewells.","她回避了那些不必要的问候和道别。"
"She would have had to say them so often, and their purpose was better served by look, pressure, and slight inclination of head to one side.","她本该经常说这些话的，但使个眼色、握一下手、微微点头，似乎更能达到目的。"
"With circular movement of her squeezed hand, she said:","她用那只刚被紧握过的手划了个圆圈，说道："
"“Draw up.","“坐下来吧。"
"Cream, sir?","先生，要奶油吗？"
"Sugar, Wilfrid?","威尔弗里德，要糖吗？"
"Ting has had too much—don’t feed him!","叮铃吃的够多的了——别再喂它了！"
"Hand things, Michael.","迈克尔，递一下。"
"I’ve heard all about the meeting at ‘Snooks.’","‘轻蔑’俱乐部开会的情况我已经全听说了。"
"You’re not going to canvass for Labour, Michael—canvassing’s so silly.","迈克尔，你不要再去为工党拉选票了——那太愚蠢了。"
"If any one canvassed me, I should vote the other way at once.”","如果有人来找我拉票，我会毫不犹豫地给另一方投票。”"
"“Yes, darling; but you’re not the average elector.”","“是呀，亲爱的。不过你可不是普通的选民啊。”"
"Fleur looked at him.","弗勒看看他。"
"Very sweetly put!","话里有话！"
"Conscious of Wilfrid biting his lips, of Sir Lawrence taking that in, of the amount of silk leg she was showing, of her black and cream teacups, she adjusted these matters.","弗勒留意到威尔弗里德咬着双唇，而劳伦斯爵士也注意到了威尔弗里德的举动。她知道她露出了一截穿着丝袜的腿，还有她桌上奶油色和黑色相间的茶杯。她对这一切都心中有数。"
"A flutter of her white lids—Desert ceased to bite his lips; a movement of her silk legs—Sir Lawrence ceased to look at him.","她那白眼皮一翻，德赛特立刻不咬嘴唇了；她那穿丝袜的腿一动，劳伦斯爵士立刻不再看威尔弗里德了。"
"Holding out her cups, she said:","她伸手放下茶杯，说道："
"“I suppose I’m not modern enough?”","“我想我还不够时髦吧？”"
"Desert, moving a bright little spoon round in his magpie cup, said without looking up:","德赛特用一把光亮的小勺在他那只绘着喜鹊的茶杯里搅动着，头也不抬地说："
"“As much more modern than the moderns, as you are more ancient.”","“你比现代人更时髦，比时髦的人更复古。”"
"“‘Ware poetry!” said Michael.","“注意诗律！”迈克尔说。"
"But when he had taken his father to see the new cartoons by Aubrey Greene, she said:","待迈克尔带他父亲去参观奥布里·格林新创作的漫画时，她说："
"“Kindly tell me what you meant, Wilfrid.”","“威尔弗里德，你说这话是什么意思。”"
"Desert’s voice seemed to leap from restraint.","德赛特的声音似乎是强挤出来的。"
"“What does it matter?","“这话怎么了？"
"I don’t want to waste time with that.”","我不想为此耽误时间。”"
"“But I want to know.","“可是我想知道。"
"It sounded like a sneer.”","这话听上去像是在讽刺。”"
"“A sneer?","“讽刺？"
"From me?","我说的？"
"Fleur!”","弗勒！”"
"“Then tell me.”","“那告诉我到底是什么意思。”"
"“I meant that you have all their restlessness and practical get-thereness; but you have what they haven’t, Fleur—power to turn one’s head.","“我的意思是，你具有了他们那种不安分以及务实的定要成功的精神，但弗勒，你还具有他们所没有的东西——使人迷糊的能力。"
"And mine is turned.","我就是被你弄迷糊的。"
"You know it.”","这点你心里明白。”"
"“How would Michael like that—from YOU, his best man?”","“要是迈克尔听见这话该有何感想——出自你，他的男傧相之口？”"
"Desert moved quickly to the windows.","德赛特快速走到窗边。"
"Fleur took Ting-a-ling on her lap.","弗勒把小叮铃抱到腿上。"
"Such things had been said to her before; but from Wilfrid it was serious.","类似的话以前也有人对她说过，但出自威尔弗里德之口，事情就变得严重了。"
"Nice to think she had his heart, of course!","但想到她已经占有了他的心，自然值得高兴！"
"Only, where on earth could she put it, where it wouldn’t be seen except by her?","只是，她究竟要把这颗心放在哪里呢，一个除她之外别人都不知道的地方？"
"He was incalculable—did strange things!","他可是个让人猜不透的人——干些令人费解的古怪事。"
"She was a little afraid—not of him, but of that quality in him.","她有些害怕——不是怕他，而是害怕他那怪脾气。"
"He came back to the hearth, and said:","他走回到壁炉前，说："
"“Ugly, isn’t it?","“很丑恶，是不是？"
"Put that dam’ dog down, Fleur; I can’t see your face.","弗勒，把那只该死的狗放下去。我看不见你的脸了。"
"If you were really fond of Michael—I swear I wouldn’t; but you’re not, you know.”","你要是真心喜欢迈克尔的话——我发誓我不会这样做。但你并不喜欢他，你心里明白。”"
"Fleur said coldly:","弗勒冷冷地说："
"“You know very little; I AM fond of Michael.”","“你知道得太少了。我是喜欢迈克尔的。”"
"Desert gave his little jerky laugh.","德赛特急促地笑笑。"
"“Oh yes; not the sort that counts.”","“不错，但算不上爱。”"
"Fleur looked up.","弗勒抬起头来。"
"“It counts quite enough to make one safe.”","“能给人安全感，就算得上了。”"
"“A flower that I can’t pick.”","“这是一朵我采不到的花。”"
"Fleur nodded.","弗勒点点头。"
"“Quite sure, Fleur?","“弗勒，你肯定吗？"
"Quite, quite sure?”","非常、非常肯定吗？”"
"Fleur stared; her eyes softened a little, her eyelids, so excessively white, drooped over them; she nodded.","弗勒凝视着他。她的眼神变得柔和了一些，她闭上那白得过分的眼皮，点了点头。"
"Desert said slowly:","德赛特慢吞吞地说："
"“The moment I believe that, I shall go East.”","“一旦我相信你说的话，我就去东方。”"
"“East?”","“东方？”"
"“Not so stale as going West, but much the same—you don’t come back.”","“不像上西天那样乏味，但结果是一样的——一去就再也不回来了。”"
"Fleur thought: ‘The East?","弗勒心想：“东方？"
"I should love to know the East!","我倒很想去东方看看！"
"Pity one can’t manage that, too.","遗憾的是，这无法办到。"
"Pity!’","遗憾啊！”"
"“You won’t keep me in your Zoo, my dear.","“亲爱的，你不可能把我关在你的动物园里。"
"I shan’t hang around and feed on crumbs.","我也不会在此逗留，并以残羹冷炙为生。"
"You know what I feel—it means a smash of some sort.”","你知道我是什么感觉吗——那就意味着决裂。”"
"“It hasn’t been my fault, has it?”","“这不是我的过错，是吧？”"
"“Yes; you’ve collected me, as you collect everybody that comes near you.”","“是你的错，是你把我招揽来的，就像你招揽着每个来到你身边的人一样。”"
"“I don’t know what you mean.”","“我不明白你的意思。”"
"Desert bent down, and dragged her hand to his lips.","德赛特弯腰，把她的手慢慢拉近自己的唇边。"

"“I don’t like violence, Wilfrid.”","“我不喜欢见你如此粗暴，威尔弗里德。”"
"“Well, good-bye; I’d better go.”","“好吧，再见。我还是走吧。”"
"The words “And you’d better not come again” trembled up to her lips, but were not spoken.","“你最好再也别来了”这句话已到嘴边，但她还是没说出口。"
"Part from Wilfrid—life would lose a little warmth!","如果和威尔弗里德分手——那么她的生活将失去一丝温暖。"
"She waved her hand.","她挥挥手。"
"He was gone.","他走了。"
"She heard the door closing.","她听到大门关上的声音。"
"Poor Wilfrid!—nice to think of a flame at which to warm her hands!","可怜的威尔弗里德！——一想到有一团可以暖手的火焰就令人兴奋！"
"Nice but rather dreadful!","兴奋，却更令人胆战心惊！"
"And suddenly, dropping Ting-a-ling, she got up and began to walk about the room.","突然，她放下小叮铃，站起来，在房间里踱起步来。"
"To-morrow!","明天！"
"Second anniversary of her wedding-day!","她结婚两周年纪念日！"
"Still an ache when she thought of what it had not been.","一想到还未实现的事，她心中不免难过。"
"But there was little time to think—and she made less.","可是没什么时间再去想了——况且她也不愿意再去想了。"
"What good in thinking?","想了又有什么好处呢？"
"Only one life, full of people, of things to do and have, of things wanted—a life only void of—one thing, and that—well, if people had it, they never had it long!","唯一的一种生活，充斥着人、要做的和拥有的事、想要得到的东西——这种生活唯一缺少的——一件东西，而且——对，人们即使得到它，也不会永远拥有它！"

"And whom should she get in place of Wilfrid, if Wilfrid wouldn’t come—silly boy!","最重要的是，她到底找谁来填补威尔弗里德的位置呢？要是他不来的话——这个傻瓜！"
"One day—one night—what difference?","白天——晚上——有什么区别呢？"
"Who should sit on her right, and who on her left?","谁坐在她的右边，谁又该坐在她的左边呢？"

"Were they either as distinguished as Walter Nazing or Charles Upshire?","他们两个人都像沃尔特·内津一样出名，还是都像查尔斯·厄普夏一样有名呢？"
"Dinner of twelve, exclusively literary and artistic, except for Michael and Alison Charwell.","晚宴的12人中，除了迈克尔和艾莉森·查韦尔之外，其他都是文学界和艺术界的。"
"Ah!","啊！"
"Could Alison get her Gurdon Minho—just one writer of the old school, one glass of old wine to mellow effervescence?","艾莉森能帮她请到格登·明霍吗？——一位老派作家，一杯令人兴奋的陈年佳酿。"
"He didn’t publish with Danby and Winter; but he fed out of Alison’s hand.","他没有在丹比&温特出版社出过书，但还是很给艾莉森面子的。"
"She went quickly to one of the old tea chests, and opened it.","她迅速走到一个陈旧的茶柜旁，打开它。"
"Inside was a telephone.","里面是一部电话。"

"Fleur speaking.","我是弗勒啊。"

"Goodbye!”","再见！”"
"Failing Minho, whom?","假如明霍先生邀请不到，那么该请谁好呢？"
"Her mind hovered over the names in her address book.","她的脑子里反复思考着通讯录中的人名。"
"At so late a minute it must be some one who didn’t stand on ceremony; but except Alison, none of Michael’s relations would be safe from Sibley Swan or Nesta Gorse, and their subversive shafts; as to the Forsytes—out of the question; they had their own sub-acid humour (some of them), but they were not modern, not really modern.","剩下的时间不多了，必须找一个不拘礼节的人。除了艾莉森以外，迈克尔的亲戚中还没有一个人能应付西布莉·斯旺或内丝塔·戈斯，并应对他们那些刻薄话；至于福赛特家族——就更不必多说了，他们具有独特的晦涩的幽默（他们中的一些人），但他们绝不是真正时髦的人。"
"Besides, she saw as little of them as she could—they dated, belonged to the dramatic period, had no sense of life without beginning or end.","此外，她对他们很看不上眼——毕竟他们已经过时了，他们属于戏剧时代，根本不懂得没有开始或结局的人生。"
"No!","不！"
"If Gurdon Minho was a frost, it would have to be a musician, whose works were hieroglyphical with a dash of surgery; or, better, perhaps, a psycho-analyst.","如果格登·明霍不肯来，那就得邀请一位音乐家，而他们的作品都像外科手术一样晦涩难懂。或许还是邀请一位精神分析学家更好一些。"

"Hugo Solstis?","雨果·苏斯迪斯？"
"A possibility; but suppose he wanted to play them something recent?","值得考虑，但是如果他要表演近期的作品，该怎么办？"
"There was only Michael’s upright Grand, and that would mean going to his study.","家里只有迈克尔的那架竖式大钢琴，这就意味着大家只能到他书房去了。"
"Better Gerald Hanks—he and Nesta Gorse would get off together on dreams; still, if they did, there would be no actual loss of life.","还是杰拉尔德·汉克斯更适合一些——他会和内丝塔·戈斯一起讨论梦，而且，他们就是那样做了，也没有什么大不了的。"
"Yes, failing Gurdon Minho, Gerald Hanks; he would be free—and put him between Alison and Nesta.","对，要是不能邀请格登·明霍，那就邀请杰拉尔德·汉克斯，他应该有空——把他的座位安排在艾莉森和内丝塔两人之间。"
"She closed the book, and, going back to her jade-green settee, sat gazing at Ting-a-ling.","她合上通讯录，走回到那把翠绿色的长靠椅旁边，坐在那里盯着小叮铃。"
"The little dog’s prominent round eyes gazed back; bright, black, very old.","小狗突出的圆眼睛也盯着她，眼睛明亮、乌黑，是她非常熟悉的眼神。"
"Fleur thought: ‘I DON’T want Wilfrid to drop off.’","弗勒心想：“我不愿意让威尔弗里德就这么离开了。”"
"Among all the crowd who came and went, here, there and everywhere, she cared for nobody.","在所有来来往往的人中，无论是在此处、他处，或是任何其他地方，她从来没有喜欢上一个人。"

"Bart had noticed Wilfrid.","准爵爷已经注意到威尔弗里德的神情了。"
"He WAS a noticing old Bart.","他可是一位洞悉一切的老准爵爷。"
"She was never very comfortable when he was about—lively and twisting, but with something settled and ancestral in him; a little like Ting-a-ling—something judgmatic, ever telling her that she was fluttering and new.","每当他在身旁，她就感到不大自在——他活泼但又很偏执，在他身上有某种很难改变的遗传的东西。他有点儿像小叮铃——善于识别人，还总是说她不仅情绪不稳定，还不谙世事。"
"He was anchored, could only move to the length of his old-fashioned cord, but he could drop on to things disconcertingly.","他的性格已经固定不变，只能在固有的习惯约束下行动，但是他会对事情刨根问底。"
"Still, he admired her, she felt—oh! yes.","但她仍感觉，他是很欣赏她的——对！欣赏。"
"Well!","哦！"
"What had he thought of the cartoons?","他对那些漫画有什么看法呢？"
"Ought Michael to publish them, and with letterpress or without?","迈克尔究竟应该不应该把它们出版呢，是否该配上文字呢？"
"Didn’t he think that the cubic called ‘Still Life’—of the Government, too frightfully funny—especially the ‘old bean’ representing the Prime?","对于这幅叫做“静物画”的立体漫画——它描绘的是政府，他是不是觉得滑稽好笑呢？——尤其是那位影射首相的“老兄”。"
"For answer she was conscious of a twisting, rapid noise; Sir Lawrence was telling her of his father’s collection of electioneering cartoons.","她得到的答案含糊其辞，劳伦斯爵士正在给她讲他父亲收集选举漫画的事情。"
"She did wish Bart would not tell her about his father; he had been so distinguished, and he must have been so dull, paying all his calls on horseback, with trousers strapped under his boots.","她从内心希望准爵爷不要向她诉说他父亲的往事；他曾经是那样高贵，但肯定也很无趣：骑马去会客，裤脚掖在靴筒里。"
"He and Lord Charles Cariboo and the Marquis of Forfar had been the last three ‘callers’ of that sort.","他、查尔斯·卡列布勋爵和福法侯爵可以算得上是这类“访客”中最后的三位了。"
"If only they hadn’t, they’d have been clean forgot.","假如他们没有这些特征，也许早已被人遗忘了。"
"She had that dress to try, and fourteen things to see to, and Hugo’s concert began at eight-fifteen!","她还要试穿一件衣服，此外还有14件事要处理，而雨果的音乐会在八点一刻就要开始了！"
"Why did people of the last generation always have so much time?","为什么上一代人总有那么多空闲时间呢？"
"And, suddenly, she looked down.","就在这时，她突然往下望了望。"
"Ting-a-ling was licking the copper floor.","小叮铃正在舔着红棕色的地板。"
"She took him up: “Not that, darling; nasty!”","她一把抱起它：“亲爱的，脏啊，别再舔了！”"
"Ah! the spell was broken!","啊！危急解除了！"
"Bart was going, reminiscent to the last.","准爵爷要走了，直到最后，他还在回首往事。"
"She waited at the foot of the stairs till Michael shut the door on him, then flew.","她在楼梯下面等着，直到迈克尔把他送出门，把门关上后，她才又飞奔回去。"
"Reaching her room, she turned on all the lights.","回到自己的屋里，她打开了所有的灯。"
"Here was her own style—a bed which did not look like one, and many mirrors.","这里是她独有的风格——有一张怎么看都不像床的床，还有很多面镜子。"
"The couch of Ting-a-ling occupied a corner, whence he could see himself in three.","小叮铃的睡椅占据房间一角，在那里它能看见镜子反映出的三个自己。"
"She put him down, and said: “Keep quiet, now!”","她把它放下来，说：“从现在开始，安静！”"
"His attitude to the other dogs in the room had long become indifferent; though of his own breed and precisely his colouring, they had no smell and no licking power in their tongues—nothing to be done with them, imitative creatures, incredibly unresponsive.","对于屋里的其他几条狗，它早已丧失兴趣了；这些狗虽然跟小叮铃是同种，皮毛也一样，但它们全然没有嗅觉，也不会用舌头舔东西——拿它们没辙，他们就会模仿，极其迟钝。"
"Stripping off her dress, Fleur held the new frock under her chin.","弗勒脱下身上的衣服，用下巴夹着那件新衣服。"
"“May I kiss you?” said a voice, and there was Michael’s image behind her own reflection in the glass.","“我可以吻你吗？”一个声音说道，镜中映出了她身后站着的迈克尔。"
"“My dear boy, there isn’t time!","“亲爱的，没时间啦！"
"Help me with this.”","帮我穿上它吧。”"
"She slipped the frock over her head.","她赶紧把衣服往头上一套，"
"“Do those three top hooks.","“把上面的三个挂钩扣上。"
"How do you like it?","你觉得这衣服怎样？"
"Oh! and—Michael!","啊！还有——迈克尔！"
"Gurdon Minho may be coming to dinner tomorrow—Wilfrid can’t.","格登·明霍明天可能要来吃饭——而威尔弗里德不来了。"
"Have you read his things?","你阅读过他的作品吗？"
"Sit down and tell me something about them.","坐下给我讲讲他的作品吧。"
"All novels, aren’t they?","他的作品都是小说是吗？"
"What sort?”","是哪一类的呢？”"

"“Oh!","“啊！"
"Have I made a gaff?”","我是不是说错话了？”"

"“Won’t they?","“真的吗？"
"My gum!”","我的天哪！”"

"“But d’you mean to say that Sibley isn’t going to live?”","“那你的意思是说西布莉不会持久存在？”"
"“Sib?","“茜布？"
"Lord, no!”","上帝，绝不会的！”"
"“But he’s so perfectly sure that almost everybody else is dead or dying.","“但他很自信，他相信除他以外所有人都已死去，或正在死去。"
"Surely he has critical genius!”","但他的确是批判的高手！”"
"“If I hadn’t more judgment than Sib, I’d go out of publishing tomorrow.”","“如果我的判断力不如茜布，那我明天就离开出版社。”"
"“You—more than Sibley Swan?”","“你——比西布莉·斯旺还精明？”"
"“Of course, I’ve more judgment than Sib.","“当然，我的判断力肯定比茜布强。"
"Why!","咳！"
"Sib’s judgment is just his opinion of Sib—common or garden impatience of any one else.","茜布的判断力只是他自己书里的见解——陈词滥调，对于别人的观点一向不耐烦。"
"He doesn’t even read them.","他甚至都不读别人的作品。"
"He’ll read one specimen of every author and say: ‘Oh! that fellow!","他只是大略读一下每位作家的作品节选，然后说：‘啊！那家伙！"
"He’s dull, or he’s moral, or he’s sentimental, or he dates, or he drivels’—I’ve heard him dozens of times.","他是愚笨的，或者是说教的、多愁善感的、过时的、胡说八道的’——我已经听他这样说过几十遍了。"
"That’s if they’re alive.","如果那些作家还在世，他就会这样说。"
"Of course, if they’re dead, it’s different.","当然，如果他们已经去世，情况就不同了。"

"But it’s the backwaters that make the main stream.","但那逆流恰好成为了主流。"
"By Jove, that’s a mot, or is it a bull; and are bulls mots or mots bulls?”","天啊，真是警世良言，但其实也是自相矛盾；那到底自相矛盾的话就是警世良言呢，还是警世良言就会自相矛盾呢？”"

"If you think he’d like to meet a Vertiginist—”","如果你以为他愿意见到一位旋转派画家——”"
"“I didn’t ask you if he’d like to meet Wilmer; I asked you if Wilmer would like to meet him.”","“我并不是问你他是否愿意遇见威尔默，我想问的是威尔默是否愿意遇见他。”"
"“Wilmer will just say: ‘I like little Mrs. Mont, she gives deuced good grub’—and so you do, ducky.","“威尔默只会说：‘我喜欢娇小的蒙特夫人，她给我们准备美食’——你的确如此，宝贝。"
"A Vertiginist wants nourishing, you know, or it wouldn’t go to his head.”","你应该清楚旋转派画家是需要营养的，否则他的脑子会生锈。”"
"Fleur’s pen resumed its swift strokes, already becoming slightly illegible.","弗勒又开始奋笔疾书，字已经很潦草了。"
"She murmured:","她咕哝着："
"“I think Wilfrid would help—you won’t be there; one—two—three.","“我想威尔弗里德会帮我的——你不必在那里；一——二——三。"
"What women?”","女嘉宾是谁呢？”"
"“For painters—pretty and plump; no intellect.”","“对画家而言——喜欢既漂亮又丰满的女子，而不喜欢那些有智慧的。”"
"Fleur said crossly:","弗勒恼怒地说着："
"“I can’t get them plump; they don’t go about now.”","“我可找不到丰满的女子，现在这种人早就绝种了。”"
"And her pen flowed on:","说着，她又继续写着，"
"“DEAR WILFRID,—Wednesday—lunch; Wilmer, Hubert Marsland, two other women.","“亲爱的威尔弗里德——周三——午餐；威尔默，休伯特·马斯兰德，还有两位女士。"
"Do help me live it down.","真切恳求你助我渡过难关。"
"“Yours ever,","你永远的，"
"“FLEUR.”","弗勒。”"
"“Michael, your chin is like a bootbrush.”","“迈克尔，你的下巴像一把靴刷子。”"
"“Sorry, old thing; your shoulders shouldn’t be so smooth.","“不好意思，亲爱的，你的肩膀不该这么光滑。"
"Bart gave Wilfrid a tip as we were coming along.”","在我们来时的路上，准爵爷给了威尔弗里德一些提示。”"
"Fleur stopped writing.","弗勒停下笔来。"
"“Oh!”","“哦！”"
"“Reminded him that the state of love was a good stunt for poets.”","“爵爷提示他，对于诗人来说，恋爱可是施展才华的绝好机会。”"
"“A propos of what?”","“都说了些什么呢？”"
"“Wilfrid was complaining that he couldn’t turn it out now.”","“威尔弗里德一直在抱怨现在他创作不出来作品。”"
"“Nonsense!","“胡说！"
"His last things are his best.”","他最新的作品正是他最好的作品。”"
"“Well, that’s what I think.","“嗯，我也有同感。"
"Perhaps he’s forestalled the tip.","也许他早就实践过那个提示了。"
"Has he, d’you know?”","他有没有实践过，你知道吗？”"
"Fleur turned her eyes towards the face behind her shoulder.","弗勒转过头，望着身后的那张脸。"
"No, it had its native look—frank, irresponsible, slightly faun-like, with its pointed ears, quick lips, and nostrils.","还是那张脸——坦率真诚、不负责任，有点儿像尊农牧神像，有着尖尖的耳朵、灵巧的嘴唇和鼻孔。"
"She said slowly:","她缓缓地说："
"“If YOU don’t know, nobody does.”","“如果连你都不知道，那更没有人知道了。”"
"A snuffle interrupted Michael’s answer.","一阵鼻息声打断了迈克尔的回答。"
"Ting-a-ling, long, low, slightly higher at both ends, was standing between them, with black muzzle upturned.","是小叮铃——它身子长、个头矮，头和尾巴稍微高一些——正站在他们两个人中间，黑乎乎的脸朝上仰着。"
"‘My pedigree is long,’ he seemed to say; ‘but my legs are short—what about it?’","它好像在说：“我可是纯种，就是腿短——这又有什么关系呢？”"

"Chapter III","第三章"
"Musical","音乐会"
"According to a great and guiding principle, Fleur and Michael Mont attended the Hugo Solstis concert, not because they anticipated pleasure, but because they knew Hugo.","依照一个伟大的并具有指导性的原则，弗勒和迈克尔·蒙特参加了雨果·苏斯迪斯的音乐会。出席这项活动不是为了娱乐，而是因为他们认识雨果。"
"They felt, besides, that Solstis, an Englishman of Russo-Dutch extraction, was one of those who were restoring English music, giving to it a wide and spacious freedom from melody and rhythm, while investing it with literary and mathematical charms.","而且，他们认为，苏斯迪斯——这个混有俄罗斯与荷兰血统的英国人——是复兴英国音乐的中坚力量之一。他使英国音乐在节奏和旋律上都获得了充分的自由，又赋予了它文学和数学的魅力。"
"And one never could go to a concert given by any of this school without using the word ‘interesting’ as one was coming away.","无论是谁参加这一流派中任何一位音乐家的音乐会，在他离开时，总要发出“有趣”的称赞。"
"To sleep to this restored English music, too, was impossible.","听这种复兴的英国音乐，也不可能打瞌睡。"
"Fleur, a sound sleeper, had never even tried.","虽说弗勒是个嗜睡的人，在这种场合却从未试着瞌睡过。"
"Michael had, and complained afterwards that it had been like a nap in Liege railway station.","迈克尔倒是打过一次瞌睡，事后却抱怨说，这就像在列日火车站打了个盹。"
"On this occasion they occupied those gangway seats in the front row of the dress circle of which Fleur had a sort of natural monopoly.","这次，他们坐在特等包厢前排靠近通道的位子，这个位子似乎就是弗勒的专座。"
"There Hugo and the rest could see her taking her place in the English restoration movement.","坐在那里，雨果和其他人都能看见她参加了这次英国复兴运动。"
"It was easy, too, to escape into the corridor and exchange the word ‘interesting’ with side-whiskered cognoscenti; or, slipping out a cigarette from the little gold case, wedding present of Cousin Imogen Cardigan, get a whiff or two’s repose.","而且，在那里也方便她溜到走廊里，和那些留着络腮胡的鉴赏家们互道一声“有趣”；或拿出表姐伊莫金·卡迪根送的结婚礼物——一个小金盒，抽出一支香烟，吸两口休息休息。"
"To speak quite honestly, Fleur had a natural sense of rhythm which caused her discomfort during those long and ‘interesting’ passages which evidenced, as it were, the composer’s rise and fall from his bed of thorns.","坦率地说，弗勒的节奏感与生俱来，当演奏到那些冗长而“有趣”的乐章时，她仿佛对作曲家所表现的如坐针毡、坐立不安的情形感同身受，这不免让她十分难受。"
"She secretly loved a tune, and the impossibility of ever confessing this without losing hold of Solstis, Baff, Birdigal, MacLewis, Clorane, and other English restoration composers, sometimes taxed to its limit a nature which had its Spartan side.","她默默喜欢一支曲调，为了不失去苏斯迪斯、巴夫、博迪格尔、麦克刘易斯、克罗雷和其他英国复兴派作曲家，她永远不会承认这一点。有时，这使她那具有自虐倾向的性格压抑到了极点。"
"Even to Michael she would not ‘confess’; and it was additionally trying when, with his native disrespect of persons, accentuated by life in the trenches and a publisher’s office, he would mutter: “Gad!Get on with it!” or: “Cripes!Ain’t he took bad!” especially as she knew that Michael was really putting up with it better than herself, having a more literary disposition, and a less dancing itch in his toes.","即使对迈克尔，她也不会承认。迈克尔生来不尊重别人，而战场上的生活和出版家的身份使他的这种态度更加严重，因此，每当他咕噜着：“上帝！快点儿过去吧！”或者“天啊！他这下可弄错了！”时，她就感到格外难受，尤其是她知道迈克尔实际比她更能忍耐，更有文学气质，而对舞蹈则没有她那么入迷。"
"The first movement of the new Solstis composition—‘Phantasmagoria Piemontesque’—to which they had especially come to listen, began with some drawn-out chords.","他们专程来听苏斯迪斯新乐曲的第一乐章——《皮埃蒙特斯克幻想曲》，该乐章以几个悠长的和弦开始。"
"“What oh!” said Michael’s voice in her ear: “Three pieces of furniture moved simultaneously on a parquet floor!”","她耳边传来迈克尔的声音：“哇哦，三件家具同时在一块镶木地板上移动！”"
"In Fleur’s involuntary smile was the whole secret of why her marriage had not been intolerable.","弗勒不禁笑了，她的婚姻并非无法忍受，她的笑容把这个秘密完全暴露了。"
"After all, Michael was a dear!","迈克尔毕竟很可爱！"
"Devotion and mercury—jesting and loyalty—combined, they piqued and touched even a heart given away before it was bestowed on him.","他既专一又活泼，既幽默又忠诚——这一切都触动甚至是感动了她，虽然在嫁给他之前她就心有所属了。"
"‘Touch’ without ‘pique’ would have bored; ‘pique’ without ‘touch’ would have irritated.","没有“触动”的“感动”惹人厌恶，而没有“感动”的“触动”又惹人恼怒。"
"At this moment he was at peculiar advantage!","此刻，他处于极其有利的地位！"
"Holding on to his knees, with his ears standing up, eyes glassy from loyalty to Hugo, and tongue in cheek, he was listening to that opening in a way which evoked Fleur’s admiration.","为了表示对雨果的尊重，他双手抓牢膝盖，双耳竖起，目光呆滞，装模作样地听着序曲。他做出的这副样子引起了弗勒的钦佩。"
"The piece would be ‘interesting’—she fell into the state of outer observation and inner calculation very usual with her nowadays.","这段乐曲会很“有趣”——她陷入了一种状态：外表看上去在观察，而内心却在无限遐想，最近她一直这样。"
"Over there was L.S.D., the greater dramatist; she didn’t know him—yet.","那边坐着L. S. D.，一位更加伟大的剧作家，她还不认识他。"
"He looked rather frightening, his hair stood up so straight.","他看上去相当可怕，头发竖得直直的。"
"And her eye began picturing him on her copper floor against a Chinese picture.","于是，她眼前浮现出一个画面：他正站在她家的红棕色地板上，身后是一幅中国画。"
"And there—yes!","啊，快看那边！"
"Gurdon Minho!","是格登·明霍！"
"Imagine HIS coming to anything so modern!","想不到他竟会到如此时髦的地方来！"
"His profile WAS rather Roman—of the Aurelian period!","他的侧面颇有点儿罗马味道——奥勒利安皇帝时期的味道。"
"Passing on from that antique, with the pleased thought that by this time tomorrow she might have collected it, she quartered the assembly face by face—she did not want to miss any one important.","她把目光从那个古董身上移开，想到明晚这个时候她准会收罗到这件东西了，心里颇为高兴，一一打量了剧场里的每一个人——她可不想遗漏任何一个重要人物。"
"“The furniture” had come to a sudden standstill.","“那件家具”突然停住了。"
"“Interesting!” said a voice over her shoulder.","“有趣！”声音从她背后传来。"
"Aubrey Greene!","是奥布里·格林！"
"Illusive, rather moonlit, with his silky fair hair brushed straight back, and his greenish eyes—his smile always made her feel that he was ‘getting’ at her.","好像幻影一般，颇有点儿月朦胧的感觉。他柔亮的金色头发笔直地向后梳着；他淡绿色的眼眸以及他的微笑，总让她有种被“挑逗”的感觉。"
"But, after all, he was a cartoonist!","不管怎么说，毕竟他也是个漫画家！"
"“Yes, isn’t it?”","“嗯，可不是吗？”"
"He curled away.","他转身走了。"
"He might have stayed a little longer—there wouldn’t be time for any one else before those songs of Birdigal’s!","他本可以多呆一会儿的。因为在博迪格尔的那几首曲子之前，其他人是不会有时间表演的！"
"Here came the singer Charles Powls!","现在歌唱家查尔斯·波尔斯出场了！"
"How stout and efficient he looked, dragging little Birdigal to the piano.","他把个子矮小的博迪格尔拖到钢琴那边，这让他看起来既壮实又能干。"
"Charming accompaniment—rippling, melodious!","迷人的伴奏——轻轻荡漾着，和谐悦耳！"
"The stout, efficient man began to sing.","这位既壮实又能干的人开始唱了。"
"How different from the accompaniment!","怎么与伴奏如此不一样呢！"
"The song hit every note just off the solar plexus.","这首歌的每个音调都没有打动她的交感神经。"
"It mathematically prevented her from feeling pleasure.","精确地讲，没有一个音调让她感到快乐。"
"Birdigal must have written it in horror of some one calling it ‘vocal.’","博迪格尔创作这首歌时，一定害怕有人将之称为“声乐作品”。"
"Vocal!","声乐作品！"
"Fleur knew how catching the word was; it would run like a measle round the ring, and Birdigal would be no more!","弗勒知道这个词极具传染性，它会像麻疹一样迅速传遍全场，这样一来，博迪格尔就完蛋了！"
"Poor Birdigal!","可怜的博迪格尔！"
"But this was ‘interesting.’","但是这一点很“有趣”。"
"Only, as Michael was saying: “O, my Gawd!”","这时，迈克尔也发出感叹：“上帝啊！”"
"Three songs!","三首歌！"
"Powls was wonderful—so loyal!","波尔斯真了不起啊——如此忠诚！"
"Never one note hit so that it rang out like music!","没有一个音符听起来像音乐！"
"Her mind fluttered off to Wilfrid.","她的思绪跑到威尔弗里德那里去了。"
"To him, of all the younger poets, people accorded the right to say something; it gave him such a position—made him seem to come out of life, instead of literature.","在所有的年轻诗人中，人们给了他话语权；这给他奠定了一种地位——似乎他来自于生活而非来自文学。"
"Besides, he had done things in the war, was a son of Lord Mullyon, would get the Mercer Prize probably, for ‘Copper Coin.’","此外，他参加过战争，是马利昂勋爵的儿子，有望凭《铜币》获得默瑟奖。"
"If Wilfrid abandoned her, a star would fall from the firmament above her copper floor.","如果威尔弗里德离她而去的话，那么一颗明星将会从她家的红棕色地板上空落下。"
"He had no right to leave her in the lurch.","他无权让她陷入困境。"
"He must learn not to be violent—not to think physically.","他必须要学会不粗鲁——不随心所欲。"
"No! she couldn’t let Wilfrid slip away; nor could she have any more sob-stuff in her life, searing passions, cul de sacs, aftermaths.","不！她决不能让威尔弗里德溜走，她也不允许自己的生活中再出现任何痛苦的事情、枯萎的感情、走不通的路以及不幸的结果。"
"She had tasted of that; a dulled ache still warned her.","她曾经尝过这种滋味，旧伤疤还在隐隐作痛，时刻提醒着她。"
"Birdigal was bowing, Michael saying: “Come out for a whiff!","博迪格尔鞠躬致谢，迈克尔说道：“出去吸口烟吧！"
"The next thing’s a dud!”","下一个节目没什么可看的！”"
"Oh! ah!","哦！啊！"
"Beethoven.","贝多芬。"
"Poor old Beethoven!","可怜的老贝！"
"So out of date—one did RATHER enjoy him!","早就过时了——人们从前确实很欣赏他！"
"The corridor, and refectory beyond, were swarming with the restoration movement.","走廊和那一边的休息室都挤满了参与复兴运动的人。"
"Young men and women with faces and heads of lively and distorted character, were exchanging the word ‘interesting.’","青年们看起来活泼而又偏执，他们彼此交流，互道“有趣”。"
"Men of more massive type, resembling sedentary matadors, blocked all circulation.","体态魁梧的男子们，像岿然不动的斗牛士，把过道都堵住了。"
"Fleur and Michael passed a little way along, stood against the wall, and lighted cigarettes.","弗勒和迈克尔向前走了几步就靠墙站住了，点燃了香烟。"
"Fleur smoked hers delicately—a very little one in a tiny amber holder.","弗勒的香烟包在琥珀烟嘴里，显得格外小巧玲珑，她优雅地吸着烟。"
"She had the air of admiring blue smoke rather than of making it; there were spheres to consider beyond this sort of crowd—one never knew who might be about!—the sphere, for instance, in which Alison Charwell moved, politico-literary, catholic in taste, but, as Michael always put it, “Convinced, like a sanitary system, that it’s the only sphere in the world; look at the way they all write books of reminiscence about each other!”","与其说她在吸烟，倒不如说她在欣赏吐出的缕缕青烟；除了这些听众外，她还要考虑其他社会领域的人——具体那个领域里会涉及什么样的人物谁也不清楚！比如，艾莉森·查韦尔的活动领域：层次广泛的政治文学。但是，正如迈克尔常说的：“类似于一种卫生制度，相信自己是世界上仅有的社会领域；可以看看他们在回忆录里是怎么写彼此的！”"
"They might, she always felt, disapprove of women smoking in public halls.","她始终感觉他们似乎不赞成妇女在公共场合吸烟。"
"Consorting delicately with iconoclasm, Fleur never forgot that her feet were in two worlds at least.","弗勒巧妙地同反对传统的人交往，从不忘记她至少同时属于两个世界。"
"Standing there, observant of all to left and right, she noted against the wall one whose face was screened by his programme.","站在那里，她观察着周围的一切，突然看到一个人靠墙站着，用节目单挡着脸。"
"‘Wilfrid,’ she thought, ‘and doesn’t mean to see me!’","她心想：“是威尔弗里德，他还故意装作没看见我！”"
"Mortified, as a child from whom a sixpence is filched, she said:","她像一个被偷走了六便士的小孩一样，感觉十分受辱。她说道："
"“There’s Wilfrid!","“那是威尔弗里德！"
"Fetch him, Michael!”","迈克尔，请他过来！”"
"Michael crossed, and touched his best man’s sleeve; Desert’s face emerged, frowning.","迈克尔走过去，碰碰他的男傧相的袖子。德赛特的脸露了出来，愁容满面。"
"She saw him shrug his shoulders, turn and walk into the throng.","她看见他耸耸肩膀，转身走入人群中去了。"
"Michael came back.","迈克尔回来了。"
"“Wilfrid’s got the hump to-night; says he’s not fit for human society—queer old son!”","“威尔弗里德今晚闷闷不乐，说自己不适合人类社会了，真是个古怪的家伙！”"
"How obtuse men were!","男人多迟钝啊！"
"Because Wilfrid was his pal, Michael did not see; and that was lucky!","因为威尔弗里德是迈克尔的朋友，迈克尔就看不出来，这倒也算幸运！"
"So Wilfrid really meant to avoid her!","这样看来，威尔弗里德真的打算避开她了！"
"Well, she would see!","好吧，她倒要瞧瞧！"
"And she said:","于是她说："
"“I’m tired, Michael; let’s go home.”","“迈克尔，我累了，咱们回家吧。”"
"His hand slid round her arm.","他轻轻挽住她的胳膊。"
"“Sorry, old thing; come along!”","“对不起，宝贝，走吧！”"
"They stood a moment in a neglected doorway, watching Woomans, the conductor, launched towards his orchestra.","他们在一个无人注意的门口站了一会儿，望着乐队指挥伍曼士朝他的管弦乐队走去。"
"“Look at him,” said Michael; “guy hung out of an Italian window, legs and arms all stuffed and flying!","“你看他，”迈克尔说，“多像挂在意式小窗上，腿和胳膊把衣服撑得满当当的，还在那儿手舞足蹈着！"
"And look at the Frapka and her piano—that’s a turbulent union!”","再看看这位弗莱帕凯和她弹的钢琴曲——真是一团糟！”"
"There was a strange sound.","突然传来一阵奇怪的声音。"
"“Melody, by George!” said Michael.","“天啊，这旋律真好听！”迈克尔说道。"
"An attendant muttered in their ears: “Now, sir, I’m going to shut the door.”","一位服务生在他们耳边低声说：“先生，我要关门了。”"
"Fleur had a fleeting view of L.S.D. sitting upright as his hair, with closed eyes.","弗勒快速瞥了一眼L. S. D.，他坐得和他头发一样笔直，闭着眼睛。"
"The door was shut—they were outside in the hall.","门关上了，他们站在了外面的大厅里。"
"“Wait here, darling; I’ll nick a rickshaw.”","“亲爱的，在这等会儿，我去叫辆人力车。”"
"Fleur huddled her chin in her fur.","弗勒将下巴缩进毛皮领子里。"
"It was easterly and cold.","天刮着东风，很冷。"
"A voice behind her said:","有个声音在她背后说道："
"“Well, Fleur, am I going East?”","“喂，弗勒，我该去东方吗？”"
"Wilfrid!","威尔弗里德！"
"His collar up to his ears, a cigarette between his lips, hands in pockets, eyes devouring.","他的衣领竖到耳根，嘴里还叼着烟，双手插兜，眼睛直勾勾地盯着她。"
"“You’re very silly, Wilfrid!”","“你真傻，威尔弗里德！”"
"“Anything you like; am I going East?”","“随你怎么想，我该去东方吗?”"
"“No; Sunday morning—eleven o’clock at the Tate.","“别去，星期天上午11点，泰特美术馆见。"
"We’ll talk it out.”","咱俩好好谈谈。”"
"“Convenu!”","“同意！”"
"And he was gone.","说完他就走了。"
"Alone suddenly, like that, Fleur felt the first shock of reality.","突然就这样孤独地一个人呆在那里，弗勒第一次被现实震撼了。"
"Was Wilfrid truly going to be unmanageable?","难道威尔弗里德真的要变得难以掌控了吗？"
"A taxicab ground up; Michael beckoned; Fleur stepped in.","一辆出租车停了下来，迈克尔招呼她，弗勒跨了进去。"
"Passing a passionately lighted oasis of young ladies displaying to the interested Londoner the acme of Parisian undress, she felt Michael incline towards her.","他们经过一片灯红酒绿之地，一群年轻女子正向饶有兴致的伦敦人展示巴黎裸体艺术的最高成就，这时，她感觉迈克尔正朝她凑过来。"
"If she were going to keep Wilfrid, she must be nice to Michael.","如果想留住威尔弗里德，她就必须对迈克尔亲热些。"
"Only:","她只说："
"“You needn’t kiss me in Piccadilly Circus, Michael!”","“迈克尔，你没必要在皮卡迪利广场吻我！”"
"“Sorry, duckie!","“对不起，宝贝！"
"It’s a little previous—I meant to get you opposite the Partheneum.”","我看时间还早，想带你到对面先贤祠去。”"
"Fleur remembered how he had slept on a Spanish sofa for the first fortnight of their honeymoon; how he always insisted that she must not spend anything on him, but must always let him give her what he liked, though she had three thousand a year and he twelve hundred; how jumpy he was when she had a cold—and how he always came home to tea.","弗勒回想起，在他们度蜜月的头两个星期里，他一直睡在西班牙式的沙发上；他一直坚持不让她给他花钱，却总是送她他想送给她的东西，尽管她一年收入3 000镑，而他只有1200镑；在她感冒时，他又是多么担心——而且他总是会回家喝下午茶。"
"Yes, he was a dear!","的确，他真的很可爱！"
"But would she break her heart if he went East or West tomorrow?","但是，如果明天他打算去东方或者西方的话，她也会伤心吗？"
"Snuggled against him, she was surprised at her own cynicism.","她依偎在他怀里，不禁为自己的玩世不恭而惊讶。"
"A telephone message written out, in the hall, ran: “Please tell Mrs. Mont I’ve got Mr. Gurding Minner.","门厅里有一条电话留言，写着：“请转告蒙特太太，我已邀请到格亭·明纳先生。"
"Lady Alisson.”","艾莉森夫人。”"
"It was restful.","这让人感觉踏实了。"
"A real antique!","一件真正的古董！"
"She turned on the lights in her room, and stood for a moment admiring it.","她打开房间里的灯，站了一会儿，欣赏着屋子。"
"Truly pretty!","真美啊！"
"A slight snuffle from the corner—Ting-a-ling, tan on a black cushion, lay like a Chinese lion in miniature; pure, remote, fresh from evening communion with the Square railings.","房间的角落里传来一阵轻微的鼻息声——是小叮铃，在黑色垫子上的棕褐色的小家伙，像只小巧的中国狮子躺在那里一样；它纯净、淡漠，刚和广场围栏夜会了一场。"
"“I see you,” said Fleur.","“我看到你了。”弗勒说。"
"Ting-a-ling did not stir; his round black eyes watched his mistress undress.","小叮铃一动不动，用浑圆的黑眼睛望着女主人脱衣服。"
"When she returned from the bathroom he was curled into a ball.","当她从浴室出来，它已蜷缩成一团。"
"Fleur thought: ‘Queer!","弗勒心想：“奇怪！"
"How does he know Michael won’t be coming?’","它怎么知道迈克尔不会来？”"
"And slipping into her well warmed bed, she too curled herself up and slept.","于是它钻进了弗勒那张舒适而温暖的床里，她也蜷起身子睡了。"
"But in the night, contrary to her custom, she awoke.","但是，到了深夜，她反常地醒了。"
"A cry—long, weird, trailing, from somewhere—the river—the slums at the back—rousing memory—poignant, aching—of her honeymoon—Granada, its roofs below, jet, ivory, gold; the watchman’s cry, the lines in Jon’s letter:","叫喊声——悠长、怪异、拖曳，不知来自何处——可能来自后面河对岸的贫民窟——唤起了她在格拉纳达度蜜月时伤心刺骨的记忆——格拉纳达的屋顶下，泛起黑玉色、象牙白和金黄色；更夫的叫喊声，让她想起了乔恩信中的那些诗句："
"“Voice in the night crying, down in the old sleeping Spanish City darkened under her white stars.","“深夜里回荡着哭泣声，从古老的沉睡的西班牙城市下传来，在她银白色的星空下黯淡。"
"What says the voice—its clear, lingering anguish?","这声音在诉说什么——是它切肤的挥之不去的痛苦吗？"
"Just the watchman, telling his dateless tale of safety?","还是巡夜人报着他那无休止的平安？"
"Just a road-man, flinging to the moon his song?","抑或是筑路人对着明月诉说自己的心声？"
"No!","不！"
"‘Tis one deprived, whose lover’s heart is weeping,","这是一位被剥夺权利的人，他恋人的心正在哭泣。"
"Just his cry: ‘How long?’”","他在叫喊：‘还要多久？’”"
"A cry, or had she dreamed it?","是有人在叫喊，还是她在做梦？"
"Jon, Wilfrid, Michael!","乔恩、威尔弗里德、迈克尔！"
"No use to have a heart!","她的心已疲惫不堪！"

"Chapter IV","第四章"
"Dining","晚宴"
"Lady Alison Charwell, born Heathfield, daughter of the first Earl of Campden, and wife to Lionel Charwell, K.C., Michael’s somewhat young uncle, was a delightful Englishwoman brought up in a set accepted as the soul of society.","艾莉森·查韦尔夫人出嫁前姓希思菲尔德，是第一代坎普登伯爵之女，是迈克尔的小叔叔、王室法律顾问莱昂内尔·查韦尔之妻。她是个讨人喜欢的英国女士，从小接受的是公认的社会主流思想教育。"
"Full of brains, energy, taste, money, and tinctured in its politico-legal ancestry by blue blood, this set was linked to, but apart from ‘Snooks’ and the duller haunts of birth and privilege.","有这样一群人，他们有智慧、有活力、有品位、有财富，出身贵族并且具有政治法律的家世背景，同“轻蔑”俱乐部有联系却又不是其中的成员，也不去特权阶级常去的沉闷场所。"
"It was gay, charming, free-and-easy, and, according to Michael, “Snobbish, old thing, aesthetically and intellectually, but they’ll never see it.","他们快乐、有趣、自由自在，但是据迈克尔所说：“亲爱的，他们在审美和智力上都是自命不凡的，他们自己却永远意识不到。"
"They think they’re the top notch—quick, healthy, up-to-date, well-bred, intelligent; they simply can’t imagine their equals.","他们自以为是上等人——机敏、健康、时尚、有教养、聪明，根本无法想象谁能比得上他们。"
"But you see their imagination is deficient.","可是，他们缺乏想象力。"
"Their really creative energy would go into a pint pot.","他们把真正的创造力用在钻牛角尖上。"
"Look at their books—they’re always ON something—philosophy, spiritualism, poetry, fishing, themselves; why, even their sonnets dry up before they’re twenty-five.","看看他们写的书——他们总在高谈阔论——哲学、唯心论、诗歌、垂钓以及他们自己，这就是为什么他们不到25岁就再也写不出什么了。"
"They know everything—except mankind outside their own set.","他们事事精通，就是不懂自己圈子之外的世界。"
"Oh! they work—they run the show—they have to; there’s no one else with their brains, and energy, and taste.","哦！他们工作——他们筹划演出——他们不得不这样做，因为没人会比他们更有头脑、精力和情趣了。"
"But they run it round and round in their own blooming circle.","于是，他们在自己盛大的圈子里没完没了地办演出。"
"It’s the world to them—and it might be worse.","对他们而言，这就是世界——而且这个世界以后也许会更不遂人意。"
"They’ve patented their own golden age; but it’s a trifle flyblown since the war.”","他们已经给他们专属的黄金时代申请了专利。不过，自从大战以来，这种专利已经名声败坏了。”"
"Alison Charwell—in and of this world, so spryly soulful, debonnaire, free, and cosy—lived within a stone’s throw of Fleur, in a house pleasant, architecturally, as any in London.","艾莉森·查韦尔就是这个圈子的一员，她活泼热情、爽朗大方、平易近人。她和弗勒住得很近，她家的建筑风格十分宜人，可以同伦敦任何住宅相媲美。"
"Forty years old, she had three children and considerable beauty, wearing a little fine from mental and bodily activity.","她今年40岁，生过三个孩子，风韵犹存，自内而外的充沛活力让她显得格外年轻。"
"Something of an enthusiast, she was fond of Michael, in spite of his strange criticisms, so that his matrimonial venture had piqued her from the start.","尽管迈克尔好作奇谈怪论，她却很欣赏和喜欢他，因此，从一开始，她就对他在婚姻上的冒险十分好奇。"
"Fleur was dainty, had quick natural intelligence—this new niece was worth cultivation.","弗勒天生丽质，又生性机敏，所以，她认为这个新侄媳妇值得栽培。"
"But, though adaptable and assimilative, Fleur had remained curiously unassimilated; she continued to whet the curiosity of Lady Alison, accustomed to the close borough of choice spirits, and finding a certain poignancy in contact with the New Age on Fleur’s copper floor.","可是，虽然弗勒是个“可塑之才”，却很奇怪地一直未被同化，这更加激发了艾莉森夫人的好奇心。夫人习惯了上等人的小圈子，在弗勒家的红棕色地板上，和“新时代”接触，她感觉很不舒服。"
"She met with an irreverence there, which, not taken too seriously, flipped her mind.","在那里，她被怠慢了，虽然她不太看重这些，但这却扰乱了她的思绪。"
"On that floor she almost felt a back number.","站在那块地板上，她几乎觉得自己很落伍。"
"It was stimulating.","这一切对她来说是一种刺激。"
"Receiving Fleur’s telephonic enquiry about Gurdon Minho, she had rung up the novelist.","那天，她一接完弗勒打听格登·明霍的电话，便立刻给这位小说家打电话。"
"She knew him, if not well.","她虽然认识他，却不太相熟。"
"Nobody seemed to know him well; amiable, polite, silent, rather dull and austere; but with a disconcerting smile, sometimes ironical, sometimes friendly.","似乎谁和他都不太熟，他和蔼可亲、彬彬有礼，却沉默寡言，颇有些沉闷和严肃；最令人不舒服的是他的笑容，有时讥笑嘲讽，有时却又和善亲切。"
"His books were now caustic, now sentimental.","他的作品时而尖酸刻薄，时而多愁善感。"
"On both counts it was rather the fashion to run him down, though he still seemed to exist.","就这两种风格，当时颇有一种把他批评得一文不值的趋势，然而他仍旧在文坛占有一席之地。"
"She rang him up.","她给他打电话。"
"Would he come to a dinner tomorrow at her young nephew, Michael Mont’s, and meet the younger generation?","她问他明天能否赏光到她年轻的侄子迈克尔·蒙特家吃饭，和年轻人交流一下。"
"His answer came, rather high-pitched:","他说当然可以，嗓门还挺高："
"“Rather!","“当然好啦！"
"Full fig, or dinner jacket?”","穿正式礼服，还是一般晚礼服？”"
"“How awfully nice of you! they’ll be ever so pleased.","“您真是太好了！知道您能出席晚宴，他们一定非常高兴。"
"Full fig, I believe.","我想，穿正式礼服吧。"
"It’s the second anniversary of their wedding.”","这也是他们结婚两周年纪念日。”"
"She hung up the receiver with the thought: ‘He must be writing a book about them!’","她挂上电话时还在想：“他一定会以他们为原型写本书的！”"
"Conscious of responsibility, she arrived early.","出于责任感，她很早就到了。"
"It was a grand night at her husband’s Inn, so that she brought nothing with her but the feeling of adventure, pleasant after a day spent in fluttering over the decision at ‘Snooks’.","今晚，她丈夫的法律协会有场大应酬，因此她只身前来参加弗勒的晚宴，只想着过来凑凑热闹。在为“轻蔑”的决议忙碌了一整天后，她此时感到轻松愉快。"
"She was received only by Ting-a-ling, who had his back to the fire, and took no notice beyond a stare.","只有小叮铃接待了她。它背对着壁炉，只朝她瞪了一眼，就没再理会她。"
"Sitting down on the jade green settee, she said:","她在那张翠绿色的长靠椅上坐下，说道："
"“Well, you funny little creature, don’t you know me after all this time?”","“喂，你这滑稽的小家伙，都这么久了，你还不认识我吗？”"
"Ting-a-ling’s black shiny gaze seemed saying: “You recur here, I know; most things recur.","小叮铃那双黑亮的眼睛似乎在说：“我知道你又来了，绝大多数事情都是这样循环往复的。"
"There is nothing new about the future.”","未来也没什么新鲜可言。”"
"Lady Alison fell into a train of thought: The new generation!","艾莉森夫人不禁陷入沉思：这就是新的一代啊！"
"Did she want her own girls to be of it!","她是否希望自己的女儿也属于这一代呢！"
"She would like to talk to Mr. Minho about that—they had had a very nice talk down at Beechgroves before the war.","她想同明霍先生谈谈这个话题——战前，在比奇格罗夫，他们有过一次畅谈。"
"Nine years ago—Sybil only six, Joan only four then!","那是九年前了——那时西比尔只有六岁，琼才四岁！"
"Time went, things changed!","光阴似箭，时过境迁！"
"A new generation!","新的一代！"
"And what was the difference?","他们到底有什么特别的呢？"
"“I think we had more tradition!” she said to herself softly.","“我想我们更传统些吧!”她轻声自语道。"
"A slight sound drew her eyes up from contemplation of her feet.","一阵轻微的声响让她移开了凝视着自己双脚的目光。"
"Ting-a-ling was moving his tail from side to side on the hearthrug, as if applauding.","小叮铃在炉前的地毯上来回摆弄尾巴，仿佛在表示欢迎。"
"Fleur’s voice, behind her, said:","这时，她身后传来了弗勒的声音："
"“Well, darling, I’m awfully late.","“亲爱的，我来得太迟了。"
"It WAS good of you to get me Mr. Minho.","你真是太好了，替我邀请到明霍先生。"
"I do hope they’ll all behave.","我希望他们都能遵守常规。"
"He’ll be between you and me, anyway; I’m sticking him at the top, and Michael at the bottom, between Pauline Upshire and Amabel Nazing.","不管怎样，他会坐在你和我中间，我把他安排在主座，迈克尔在末座，迈克尔两旁分别是保利娜·厄普夏和阿玛贝尔·内津。"
"You’ll have Sibley on your left, and I’ll have Aubrey on my right, then Nesta Gorse and Walter Nazing; opposite them Linda Frewe and Charles Upshire.","西布莉坐在你左边，奥布里坐在我右边，挨着他们的是内丝塔·戈斯和沃尔特·内津，他们对面是琳达·弗鲁和查尔斯·厄普夏。"
"Twelve.","一共12个人。"
"You know them all.","你全都认识。"
"Oh! and you mustn’t mind if the Nazings and Nesta smoke between the courses.","哦！如果内津夫妇和内丝塔在上菜的间歇吸烟，你可别见怪啊。"
"Amabel will do it.","阿玛贝尔可能也抽烟。"
"She comes from Virginia—it’s the reaction.","她来自弗吉尼亚——那里的人都好抽烟。"
"I do hope she’ll have some clothes on; Michael always says it’s a mistake when she has; but having Mr. Minoho makes one a little nervous.","我真希望她穿点儿衣服在身上，迈克尔老是说她穿上衣服是个错误；不过，明霍先生在场，气氛会有点儿紧张。"
"Did you see Nesta’s skit in ‘The Bouquet’?","你看过《恭维话》里内丝塔的那篇讽刺短文吗？"
"Oh, too frightfully amusing—clearly meant for L.S.D.!","啊，那真是太有趣了——明明指的就是L. S. D.啊！"
"Ting, my Ting, are you going to stay and see all these people?","叮铃，我的叮铃，你想留在这见见所有客人吗？"
"Well, then, get up here or you’ll be trodden on.","那么，爬上来吧，不然你会被踩到的。"
"Isn’t he Chinese?","看它是不是中国狗？"
"He does so round off the room.”","它的确使整个房间熠熠生辉。”"
"Ting-a-ling laid his nose on his paws, in the centre of a jade green cushion.","小叮铃把鼻子放在爪子上，趴在了翠绿色的靠垫中央。"
"“Mr. Gurding Minner!”","“格亭·明纳先生来了！”"
"The well-known novelist looked pale and composed.","这位著名小说家脸色苍白、神态自若。"
"Shaking the two extended hands, he gazed at Ting-a-ling, and said:","他与两个人握手，眼睛盯着小叮铃，说道："
"“How nice!","“多可爱!"
"How are YOU, my little man?”","你好吗，小家伙？”"
"Ting-a-ling did not stir.","小叮铃动也不动。"
"“You take me for a common English dog, sir!” his silence seemed to say.","它的沉默似乎在说：“你把我当成一只普通的英国狗了，先生！”"
"""Mr. and Mrs. Walter Nazon, Miss Lende Frow. ""","“沃尔特·内森夫妇到了，琳达·弗劳小姐到了。”"
"Amabel Nazing came first, clear alabaster from her fair hair down to the six inches of gleaming back above her waist-line, shrouded alabaster from four inches below the knee to the gleaming toes of her shoes; the eminent novelist mechanically ceased to commune with Ting-a-ling.","阿玛贝尔·内津先走了进来。从她美丽的头发到腰上六寸若隐若现的背部，宛如明净的雪花石膏；从膝盖以下四寸到鞋里微微露出的脚趾，则像是裹着一层布的雪花石膏。这位著名的小说家也不由得停止了与小叮铃的交流。"
"Walter Nazing, who followed a long way up above his wife, had a tiny line of collar emergent from swathes of black, and a face, cut a hundred years ago, that slightly resembled Shelley’s.","沃尔特·内津一路跟在妻子后面，他身材高大，从黑色的衣服里露出一小截衣领，他的脸像是从一百年前雕刻出来的，有点儿像雪莱。"
"His literary productions were sometimes felt to be like the poetry of that bard, and sometimes like the prose of Marcel Proust.","他文学作品的风格有时像雪莱，有时又像马塞尔·普鲁斯特。"
"“What oh!” as Michael said.","就像迈克尔所说：“这算什么呀！”"
"Linda Frewe, whom Fleur at once introduced to Gurdon Minho, was one about whose work no two people in her drawing-room ever agreed.","弗勒立刻把琳达·弗鲁介绍给格登·明霍认识。对于琳达的作品，在这个客厅的客人们中，从来没有得到过统一的见解。"
"Her works ‘Trifles’ and ‘The Furious Don’ had quite divided all opinion.","人们对她的两部作品《琐事》和《狂怒的西班牙绅士》，意见分歧都很大。"
"Genius according to some, drivel according to others, those books always roused an interesting debate whether a slight madness enhanced or diminished the value of art.","有些人认为是上乘之作，有些人认为是胡说八道，她的作品总是会引起一场有趣的辩论——小小的疯狂到底是会加强艺术的价值，还是会贬低艺术的价值？"
"She herself paid little attention to criticism—she produced.","她本人对此类评论并不介怀，她只管继续创作。"
"“THE Mr. Minho?","“您就是明霍先生？"
"How interesting!","多有趣啊!"
"I’ve never read anything of yours.”","我还没读过您的任何一部作品。”"
"Fleur gave a little gasp.","弗勒微微喘了口气。"
"“What—don’t you know Mr. Minho’s cats?","“什么——你不知道明霍先生写的猫吗？"
"But they’re wonderful.","写得好极了。"
"Mr. Minho, I do want Mrs. Walter Nazing to know you.","明霍先生，我再介绍你认识沃尔特·内津夫人。"
"Amabel—Mr. Gurdon Minho.”","这位是阿玛贝尔，这位是格登·明霍先生。”"
"“Oh!","“哦！"
"Mr. Minho—how perfectly lovely!","明霍先生，见到您真荣幸！"
"I’ve wanted to know you ever since my cradle.”","我老早就想认识您了。”"
"Fleur heard the novelist say quietly:","弗勒听到这位小说家平静地说："
"“I could wish it had been longer;” and passed on in doubt to greet Nesta Gorse and Sibley Swan, who came in, as if they lived together, quarrelling over L.S.D., Nesta upholding him because of his ‘panache’, Sibley maintaining that wit had died with the Restoration; this fellow was alive!","“我也希望更早些认识您。”然后疑惑地走过去和刚进来的内丝塔·戈斯和西布莉·斯旺打招呼。她们两人一同进来，好像住在一起似的，边走边争论着，争论的焦点好像是L. S. D.。内丝塔因为他的作品《羽饰》而拥护他，西布莉则认为，机智已经随着复兴运动而死亡，这个人却还活着！"
"Michael followed with the Upshires and Aubrey Greene, whom he had encountered in the hall.","迈克尔跟在厄普夏夫妇和奥布里·格林后面一起进来，他在门厅碰见了他们。"
"The party was complete.","宴会的客人到齐了。"
"Fleur loved perfection, and that evening was something of a nightmare.","弗勒追求事事完美，而那天晚上有点儿噩梦的感觉。"
"Was it a success?","这算成功吗？"
"Minho was so clearly the least brilliant person there; even Alison talked better.","宴会上，明霍显然是最没意思的人，连艾莉森的谈吐都比他强。"
"And yet he had such a fine skull.","不过，他却头脑精明。"
"She did hope he would not go away early.","她真希望他不会过早离开。"
"Some one would be almost sure to say ‘Dug up!’ or ‘Thick and bald!’ before the door closed behind him.","只要他起身离开，门还没关严，肯定就会有人说：“出土的古董！”或“又呆又秃！”。"
"He was pathetically agreeable, as if trying to be liked, or, at least, not despised too much.","他忍气吞声地附和别人，试图讨好大家，或者，至少不要太招人鄙视。"
"And there must, of course, be more in him than met the sense of hearing.","当然，他脑子里的东西肯定比他讲给大家听的要多。"
"After the crab souffle he did seem to be talking to Alison, and all about youth.","吃过蟹粉蛋奶酥后，他好像确实在和艾莉森聊天，内容全是关于年轻人的。"
"Fleur listened with one ear.","弗勒竖起耳朵听着。"
"“Youth feels... main stream of life... not giving it what it wants.","“青春年少时感觉到……生活的主流……没有得到它所向往的东西。"
"Past and future getting haloes... Quite!","过去和未来获得光荣……的确如此！"
"Contemporary life no earthly just now... No... Only comfort for us—we’ll be antiquated, some day, like Congreve, Sterne, Defoe... have our chance again... WHY?","在当代生活中，已经没有正义可言了……不……对我们只有安慰——总有一天我们都会过时，像康格里夫、斯特恩、笛福……我们还会有机会……为什么？"
"What IS driving them out of the main current?","是什么正在把他们赶出主流？"
"Oh!","哦！"
"Probably surfeit... newspapers... photographs.","可能是暴饮暴食……报纸……照片。"
"Don’t see life itself, only reports... reproductions of it; all seems shoddy, lurid, commercial... Youth says ‘Away with it, let’s have the past or the future!’”","不思考生活本身，只看报道……生活的复制品，一切都显得质量低劣、耸人听闻和商业化……年轻人常说：‘管它呢，让我们享受过去或未来！’”"
"He took some salted almonds, and Fleur saw his eyes stray to the upper part of Amabel Nazing.","他吃了几颗盐渍杏仁，弗勒发现他的眼神落到了阿玛贝尔·内津的上半身。"
"Down there the conversation was like Association football—no one kept the ball for more than one kick.","宴会进行到这里，谈话就像踢英式足球——没人留住球，每个人只是踢一脚出去。"
"It shot from head to head.","球在大家之间被踢来踢去。"
"And after every set of passes some one would reach out and take a cigarette, and blow a blue cloud across the unclothed refectory table.","而且每传过一圈之后，就有人伸手拿支烟，把一团青烟喷到那张未铺桌布的狭长的餐桌上。"
"Fleur enjoyed the glow of her Spanish room—its tiled floor, richly coloured fruits in porcelain, its tooled leather, copper articles, and Soames’ Goya above a Moorish divan.","弗勒对她这间西班牙式房间的富丽堂皇的装修风格十分欣赏——花砖地面上印着盛满各色水果的瓷器，还有精工细刻的皮革、铜制品以及挂在摩尔式长沙发上的那幅索米斯画的戈雅。"
"She headed the ball promptly when it came her way, but initiated nothing.","她只在球飞到她这里时，才立即用头顶过去，她并不发球。"
"Her gift was to be aware of everything at once.","她有眼观六路、耳听八方的本领。"
"“Mrs. Michael Mont presented” the brilliant irrelevancies of Linda Frewe, the pricks and stimulations of Nesta Gorse, the moonlit sliding innuendoes of Aubrey Greene, the upturning strokes of Sibley Swan, Amabel Nazing’s little cool American audacities, Charles Upshire’s curious bits of lore, Walter Nazing’s subversive contradictions, the critical intricacies of Pauline Upshire; Michael’s happy-go-lucky slings and arrows, even Alison’s knowledgeable quickness, and Gurdon Minho’s silences—she presented them all, showed them off, keeping her eyes and ears on the ball of talk lest it should touch earth and rest.","在“迈克尔·蒙特夫人呈现”中，她把大家的特点全都展示出来，呈现给大家——琳达·弗鲁的才华横溢与文不对题、内丝塔·戈斯的一针见血与激励刺激，奥布里·格林不动声色的含沙射影、西布莉·斯旺天翻地覆式的出击、阿玛贝尔·内津不顾一切的美国式鲁莽、查尔斯·厄普夏奇特的奇闻轶事、沃尔特·内津颠覆性的矛盾说辞、保利娜·厄普夏批判性的论点、迈克尔心不在焉的讽刺话，还有艾莉森的见识和机敏、格登·明霍的沉默——她时刻关注着那个谈话的“球”，唯恐它落在地上不动了。"
"Brilliant evening; but—a success?","美好的夜晚，可是——这算成功吗？"
"On the jade green settee, when the last of them had gone and Michael was seeing Alison home, she thought of Minho’s ‘Youth—not getting what it wants.’","等到最后一位客人离去，迈克尔也去送艾莉森回家了，她坐在翠绿长椅上，想起明霍刚才那句话：“青春年少时——没有得到向往的东西。”"
"No!","不！"
"Things didn’t fit.","事情不该如此。"
"“They don’t fit, do they, Ting!”","“现在事情不妥，是吗，叮铃？”"
"But Ting-a-ling was tired, only the tip of one ear quivered.","但是小叮铃已经累了，只是一只耳尖动了动。"
"Fleur leaned back and sighed.","弗勒靠在椅背上，叹了口气。"
"Ting-a-ling uncurled himself, and putting his forepaws on her thigh, looked up in her face.","小叮铃舒展开身体，前爪趴在她的大腿上，抬头望着她。"
"“Look at me,” he seemed to say, “I’m all right.","它似乎在说：“你看看我，我很好。"
"I get what I want, and I want what I get.","我得到了我所要的，我要我所得到的。"
"At present I want to go to bed.”","现在，我想去睡觉。”"
"“But I don’t,” said Fleur, without moving.","“但是我不想睡。”弗勒说，一动也不动。"
"“Just take me up!” said Ting-a-ling.","“那就抱我起来吧！”小叮铃说。"
"“Well,” said Fleur, “I suppose—It’s a nice person, but not the right person, Ting.”","弗勒说：“嗯，我想这个人不错，但不合适，叮铃。”"
"Ting-a-ling settled himself on her bare arms.","小叮铃在她的怀里安静下来。"
"“It’s all right,” he seemed to say.","“没关系的，”它好像在说，"
"“There’s a great deal too much sentiment and all that, out of China.","“除了在中国，此类多愁善感的感情事多的是。"
"Come on!”","振作起来吧!”"

"Chapter V","第五章"
"Eve","夏娃"
"The Honourable Wilfrid Desert’s rooms were opposite a picture gallery off Cork Street.","尊敬的威尔弗里德·德赛特先生的寓所位于科克大街一家画廊的对面。"
"The only male member of the aristocracy writing verse that any one would print, he had chosen them for seclusion rather than for comfort.","他出身贵族，是本家族中唯一一位男性诗人，而且很多人都肯为其出版。他选择住在这里，不是为了舒适，而是图其隐蔽。"
"His ‘junk,’ however, was not devoid of the taste and luxury which overflows from the greater houses of England.","然而，他的那些“破烂”摆设并不缺乏英国上流社会所富有的品位和奢华。"
"Furniture from the Hampshire seat of the Cornish nobleman, Lord Mullyon, had oozed into two vans, when Wilfrid settled in.","威尔弗里德搬进去的时候，曾从康沃尔贵族马利昂勋爵在汉普郡的宅邸悄悄运来了两大车的家具。"
"He was seldom to be found, however, in his nest, and was felt to be a rare bird, owing his rather unique position among the younger writers partly to his migratory reputation.","可是，人们很少能在他家里找到他。多半由于他飘忽不定的行踪，他在年轻一代作家中占据了相当独特的地位，人们都感觉他是稀有物种。"
"He himself hardly, perhaps, knew where he spent his time, or did his work, having a sort of mental claustrophobia, a dread of being hemmed in by people.","因其患有一种精神上的幽闭恐惧症，害怕人们的包围，也许就连他自己也不一定知道是在哪里消磨时间的，或是在什么地方工作的。"
"When the war broke out he had just left Eton; when the war was over he was twenty-three, as old a young man as ever turned a stave.","战争爆发的时候，他刚从伊顿公学毕业；战争结束时，23岁的他已经是一名舞文弄墨的青年诗人了。"
"His friendship with Michael, begun in hospital, had languished and renewed itself suddenly, when in 1920 Michael joined Danby and Winter, publishers, of Blake Street, Covent Garden.","他和迈克尔的友谊始于一家医院，两人的关系也曾一度转淡，但是在1920年又突然升温了。因为那时，迈克尔加入了位于科芬园布莱克街上的丹比&温特出版社。"
"The scattery enthusiasm of the sucking publisher had been roused by Wilfrid’s verse.","这位初出茅庐的出版商的沉睡的热情被威尔弗里德的诗句激发了出来。"
"Hob-nobbing lunches over the poems of one in need of literary anchorage, had been capped by the firm’s surrender to Michael’s insistence.","而这位诗人正需要找家出版社当靠山。经过多次共进午餐，两人密切地探讨了这些诗歌，最终在迈克尔的坚持下，出版社做出了让步。"
"The mutual intoxication of the first book Wilfrid had written and the first book Michael had sponsored was crowned at Michael’s wedding.","两个人都很兴奋：威尔弗里德写成了第一本书，这也是迈克尔资助出版的第一本书。两人的这份兴奋之情在迈克尔的婚礼上达到了顶峰。"
"Best man!","伴郎！"
"Since then, so far as Desert could be tied to anything, he had been tied to those two; nor, to do him justice, had he realised till a month ago that the attraction was not Michael, but Fleur.","从那时起，威尔弗里德那颗浪子的心便有了羁绊，他开始牵挂这对新人。说句公道话，直到一个月前，他才意识到吸引自己的并非迈克尔，而是弗勒。"
"Desert never spoke of the war, it was not possible to learn from his own mouth an effect which he might have summed up thus: “I lived so long with horror and death; I saw men so in the raw; I put hope of anything out of my mind so utterly, that I can never more have the faintest respect for theories, promises, conventions, moralities, and principles.","德赛特从不开口谈论战争，想从他的嘴里得出他对战争的印象是不可能的。这种印象他也许已经总结成这样：“我在恐怖和死亡中生活了那么久；我看到人们过着那种野蛮的、非人的生活；我对任何事都彻底绝望，对各种理论、诺言、协约、道德和原则不会再抱有一丝尊重。"
"I have hated too much the men who wallowed in them while I was wallowing in mud and blood.","当我在泥水和血水中打滚时，我恨透了那些沉湎于这些玩意的人。"
"Illusion is off.","幻想破灭了。"
"No religion and no philosophy will satisfy me—words, all words.","宗教和哲学都无法说服我——空话，全是空话。"
"I have still my senses—no thanks to them; am still capable—I find—of passion; can still grit my teeth and grin; have still some feeling of trench loyalty, but whether real or just a complex, I don’t yet know.","我仍有感觉——并不是由于上述这些玩意产生的感觉；我发现——我仍有热情，仍旧能够咬紧牙关咧着嘴笑，也还有一些战壕里的忠诚感，但这究竟是真实的反应还是某种情结，我就不得而知了。"
"I am dangerous, but not so dangerous as those who trade in words, principles, theories, and all manner of fanatical idiocy to be worked out in the blood and sweat of other men.","我是个危险人物，但同那些用别人的血汗来换取各种空话、原则、理论以及具有狂热愚蠢的行为的人相比，我远不及他们危险。"
"The war’s done one thing for me—converted life to comedy.","那场战争为我做了一件事——把人生变成了滑稽喜剧。"
"Laugh at it—there’s nothing else to do!”","对它笑吧——除此以外，别无他法！”"
"Leaving the concert hall on the Friday night, he had walked straight home to his rooms.","周五晚上离开音乐厅后，他径直走回自己的寓所。"
"And lying down full length on a monk’s seat of the fifteenth century, restored with down cushions and silk of the twentieth, he crossed his hands behind his head and delivered himself to these thoughts: ‘I am not going on like this.","他伸直了腿，躺在一张15世纪的僧侣坐榻上——这张坐榻是用20世纪的绒毛坐垫和丝绸修复而成的，双手交叉叠放在脑后，陷入了沉思：“我不能再这样下去了。"
"She has bewitched me.","我已经被她迷住了。"
"It doesn’t mean anything to her.","这对她来说算不上什么。"
"But it means hell to me.","但对我却意味着毁灭。"
"I’ll finish with it on Sunday—Persia’s a good place.","我会在周日解决这件事——波斯是个好地方。"
"Arabia’s a good place—plenty of blood and sand!","阿拉伯半岛是个好地方——鲜血和沙砾多的是！"
"She’s incapable of giving anything up.","她是不会放弃任何东西的。"
"How has she hooked herself into me!","她一直费尽心思地与我纠缠！"
"By trick of eyes, and hair, by her walk, by the sound of her voice—by trick of warmth, scent, colour.","她会用眼神、头发、走路的姿势、说话的声音，还有温情、气味、颜色等等小手段来吸引我。"
"Fling her cap over the windmill—not she!","可是，她会冒上身败名裂的危险吗？不，她不会。"
"What then?","那怎么办？"
"Am I to hang about her Chinese fireside and her little Chinese dog; and have this ache and this fever because I can’t be kissing her?","难道要我围着她的中式壁炉和中国小狗打转，还要忍受不能亲她的痛苦和狂热吗？"
"I’d rather be flying again in the middle of Boche whiz-bangs!","我宁愿再到德国人的枪林弹雨中去驰骋！"
"Sunday!","周日！"
"How women like to drag out agonies!","女人怎么都喜欢拖拖拉拉，让痛苦的时间更久啊！"
"It’ll be just this afternoon all over again.","到时候只会是今天下午的情形再次上演。"
"“How unkind of you to go, when your friendship is so precious to me!","‘你的友情对我而言非常珍贵，你怎么这么残忍地要走啊！"
"Stay, and be my tame cat, Wilfrid!”","留下来，做我听话的小猫吧，威尔弗里德！’"
"No, my dear, for once you’re up against it!","不，亲爱的，这一次你要有大麻烦了！"
"And—so am I, by the Lord!...’","同样——我也惹上麻烦了，上帝啊！……”"
"When in that gallery which extends asylum to British art, those two young people met so accidentally on Sunday morning in front of Eve smelling at the flowers of the Garden of Eden, there were present also six mechanics in various stages of decomposition, a custodian and a couple from the provinces, none of whom seemed capable of observing anything whatever.","周日上午，在那个成为英国艺术品收容所的美术馆里，这两个年轻人“很凑巧”地在一幅夏娃嗅着伊甸园花香的画前相遇了。当时附近还有六个不同年纪的工匠、一个看管员和一对外地来的夫妻，这些人看起来都不像会注意观察周围的事情。"
"And, indeed, that meeting was inexpressive.","而且那次会面是平静的。"
"Two young people, of the disillusioned class, exchanging condemnations of the past.","两个属于幻想破灭阶级的年轻人互相谴责对方此前的行为。"
"Desert with his off-hand speech, his smile, his well-tailored informality, suggested no aching heart.","德赛特以他那随意的谈吐、微笑和精心剪裁的休闲着装，让人觉得他并不心痛。"
"Of the two Fleur was the paler and more interesting.","相比之下，还是弗勒面色更苍白，也更引人关注。"
"Desert kept saying to himself: “No melodrama—that’s all it would be!”","德赛特不住地提醒自己：“不要煽情——只有这样才好！”"
"And Fleur was thinking: ‘If I can keep him ordinary like this, I shan’t lose him, because he’ll never go away without a proper outburst.’","而弗勒却在想：“要是我能让他保持这样平常的状态，我就不会失去他了。因为他不适当发泄一下是不会罢休的。”"
"It was not until they found themselves a second time before the Eve, that he said:","直到两个人再次在那幅夏娃的画前相遇，他才说："
"“I don’t know why you asked me to come, Fleur.","“我不明白你为什么要叫我来，弗勒。"
"It’s playing the goat for no earthly reason.","你这是在无理取闹。"
"I quite understand your feeling.","我很理解你的心情。"
"I’m a bit of ‘Ming’ that you don’t want to lose.","我只不过是你不愿失去的一件‘明朝’古玩。"
"But it’s not good enough, my dear; and that’s all about it.”","但是这件古玩又不够好，亲爱的。仅此而已。”"
"“How horrible of you, Wilfrid!”","“你太可怕了，威尔弗里德！”"
"“Well!","“好了！"
"Here we part!","就此分手吧！"
"Give us your flipper.”","伸出你的小手来。”"
"His eyes—rather beautiful—looked dark and tragic above the smile on his lips, and she said stammering:","他的眼睛——很美丽的眼睛——在他微笑的双唇上方显得深邃而悲哀。她结结巴巴地说："
"“Wilfrid—I—I don’t know.","“威尔弗里德——我——我不知道。"
"I want time.","我需要时间。"

"Don’t go away!","别离开我！"
"Perhaps I—I shall be unhappy, too; I—I don’t know.”","也许——我也会不快乐的。我——我不知道。”"
"Through Desert passed the bitter thought: ‘She CAN’T let go—she doesn’t know how.’","德赛特心头里掠过一丝苦涩：“她不会放手的——她不知道怎么放手。”"
"But he said quite softly: “Cheer up, my child; you’ll be over all that in a fortnight.","但是他的话却很温柔：“开心一点儿，我的宝贝。半个月之后你就会把这些都忘掉的。"
"I’ll send you something to make up.","我会送你点儿东西作为补偿的。"

"Give it me!","把手递给我！"
"Come on!”","快点儿！”"
"Fleur put her hand behind her back.","弗勒把手放在自己身后。"
"It was too mortifying!","这太气人了！"
"He took her for a cold-blooded, collecting little cat—clutching and playing with mice that she didn’t want to eat!","他把她当作一只有收藏嗜好的冷血小猫——用爪子玩弄它不想吃的老鼠！"
"“You think I’m made of ice,” she said, and her teeth caught her upper lip: “Well, I’m not!”","“你以为我是冰做的吗，”她用牙咬着上唇说，“不，我不是！”"
"Desert looked at her; his eyes were very wretched.","德赛特看着她，眼神非常沮丧。"
"“I didn’t mean to play up your pride,” he said.","“我并不是有意嘲弄你的自尊心，”他说，"
"“Let’s drop it, Fleur.","“我们丢开自尊吧，弗勒。"
"It isn’t any good.”","它一点儿用处都没有。”"
"Fleur turned and fixed her eyes on the Eve—rumbustious-looking female, care-free, avid, taking her fill of flower perfume!","弗勒转过身去，凝视着那幅画中的夏娃——这个神情放荡的女人，她无所顾忌、贪婪，正满心享受着花香！"
"Why not be care-free, take anything that came along?","我为什么就不能像她这样无所顾忌、来者不拒呢？"
"Not so much love in the world that one could afford to pass, leaving it unsmelled, unplucked.","世上没有太多的爱情供人放弃，不闻不采。"
"Run away!","私奔吧！"
"Go to the East!","到东方去！"

"But, perhaps—What did it matter? one man or another, when neither did you really love!","但是，也许会——这有什么关系呢？这个男人或是那个男人，反正都不是你爱的那个人！"

"Wait!”","等着！”"
"And without another word or look, she walked away, leaving Desert breathless before the avid Eve.","然后，她没有再说一句话或是再看一眼他就走开了，撇下连气都透不过来的德赛特一个人站在那贪婪的夏娃面前。"

"Chapter VI","第六章"
"‘Old Forsyte’ and ‘Old Mont’","“老福赛特”和“老蒙特”"
"Moving away, in the confusion of her mood, Fleur almost trod on the toes of a too-familiar figure standing before an Alma Tadema with a sort of grey anxiety, as if lost in the mutability of market values.","弗勒心烦意乱地走着，险些踩到一个极熟悉的人的脚。这个人面色阴沉、神情焦急地站在一幅阿尔玛·塔德玛的作品前，仿佛迷失在那涨跌不定的市场价值里。"

"“There’s Ting and a cat!”","“是叮铃和一只猫！”"

"Placing his hat alongside the other, Soames looked at them.","索姆斯把自己的帽子挂在那顶帽子旁边，然后望着它们。"
"They were too similar for words, tall, high, shiny, and with the same name inside.","这两顶帽子实在太像了，都是高高的、昂贵的、锃亮的，连里面的商标都是一样的。"

"And out of the corner of her eye she watched those two.","她用眼角的余光观察着那两位。"
"The meetings between ‘Old Mont’ and ‘Old Forsyte’—as she knew Bart called her father when speaking of him to Michael—always made her want to laugh, but she never quite knew why.","“老蒙特”和“老福赛特”——她知道准爵爷和迈克尔谈起她父亲时是这样称呼他的——他俩一见面，总是会让她忍俊不禁，可是她从不知道为什么要笑。"
"Bart knew everything, but his knowledge was beautifully bound, strictly edited by a mind tethered to the ‘eighteenth century.’","准爵爷什么都知道，但是他的知识就像一本精装的书，由那颗遗留在“18世纪”的头脑严格编辑过。"
"Her father only knew what was of advantage to him, but the knowledge was unbound, and subject to no editorship.","而她的父亲只知道那些有利于他的事情，他的知识是本没有装订的书，而且不受编辑的限制。"

"Fleur’s acuteness had long perceived a difference which favoured her father.","以弗勒的精明，早就觉察到两个老人家的不同，而且这种差异对她的父亲更有利。"

"Really impossible to tell which of the two was the better museum specimen; and both so well-preserved!","要分辨出两个人中哪一个会是较好博物馆的收藏品，确实是不可能。更何况，两个人都保养得那么好！"
"They did not precisely shake hands; but Soames mentioned the weather.","他们的确没有握手，但是索姆斯谈了天气。"
"And almost at once they all four sought that Sunday food which by a sustained effort of will Fleur had at last deprived of reference to the British character.","然后他们四个人几乎都想立刻开始周日的午餐。在弗勒坚持不懈的努力下，这些食物终于摆脱了英国风味。"
"They partook, in fact, of lobster cocktails, and a mere risotto of chickens’ livers, an omelette au rhum, and dessert trying to look as Spanish as it could.","实际上，他们吃的是龙虾冷盘、意式鸡肝煨饭、朗姆炒蛋，还有一份做得尽可能看起来像西班牙式的甜点。"

"We’re the oldest country in the world politically, and the youngest aesthetically.","从政治上来说，我们是世界上最古老的国家，而从艺术上来说，是最年轻的国家。"
"What do you say, Forsyte?”","福赛特，你觉得呢？”"

"“We settle the report.”","“我们要完成那个报告。”"
"It was through ‘Old Mont’s’ influence that he had received a seat on the Board of that flourishing concern, the Providential Premium Reassurance Society, and, truth to tell, he was not sitting very easily in it.","正是在“老蒙特”的关照下，他才获得了那个生意兴隆的公司——天佑再保险公司——董事会的一个席位。说实话，这个位子他坐得并不轻松。"
"Though the law of averages was, perhaps, the most reliable thing in the world, there were circumstances which had begun to cause him disquietude.","尽管平均定律也许是世界上最可靠的东西，但是已经有些情况引起他的不安了。"
"He looked round his nose.","他定睛看看身边这家伙。"
"Light weight, this narrow-headed, twisting-eyebrowed baronet of a chap—like his son before him!","准男爵身子薄、脑瓜尖，眉毛拧成了一团——和坐在他面前的儿子一个模样！"
"And he added suddenly: “I’m not easy.","然后他突然补充道：“我并不轻松。"
"If I’d realised how that chap Elderson ruled the roost, I doubt if I should have come on to that Board.”","要是我早知道埃尔德森那家伙大权独揽，我怀疑我还会不会进入董事会。”"
"One side of ‘Old Mont’s’ face seemed to try to leave the other.","“老蒙特”脸上顿时挂不住了。"
"“Elderson!” he said.","“埃尔德森！”他说，"
"“His grandfather was my grandfather’s parliamentary agent at the time of the Reform Bill; he put him through the most corrupt election ever fought—bought every vote—used to kiss all the farmer’s wives.","“改革法案时期，他的祖父是我祖父所在党的法律顾问，帮助我祖父在有史以来最腐败的选举中获胜——每一张选票都是买来的——常常讨好所有农民的妻子。"
"Great days, Forsyte, great days!”","伟大的时代，福赛特，伟大的时代！”"
"“And over,” said Soames.","“但已经过去了，”索姆斯说，"
"“I don’t believe in trusting a man’s judgment as far as we trust Elderson’s; I don’t like this foreign insurance.”","“我觉得我们不应该这么相信埃尔德森的判断力，我不喜欢这种国外保险。”"
"“My dear Forsyte—first-rate head, Elderson; I’ve known him all my life, we were at Winchester together.”","“亲爱的福赛特——埃尔德森的头脑是一流的，我从小就认识他，我们一起在温切斯特读过书。”"
"Soames uttered a deep sound.","索姆斯发出一声深沉的声音。"
"In that answer of ‘Old Mont’s’ lay much of the reason for his disquietude.","“老蒙特”的话里也有很多让他不安的理由。"
"On the Board they had all, as it were, been at Winchester together!","董事会的所有人，看起来都像在温切斯特一起读过书似的。"
"It was the very deuce!","真是见鬼了！"
"They were all so honourable that they dared not scrutinise each other, or even their own collective policy.","大家都这么体面，以至于不敢互相审查，也不敢审查大家共同的保险单。"
"Worse than their dread of mistake or fraud was their dread of seeming to distrust each other.","他们害怕表现出对彼此的不信任，甚于害怕错误或是欺诈。"
"And this was natural, for to distrust each other was an immediate evil.","这是很正常的，因为彼此不信任是一种直接的罪孽。"
"And, as Soames knew, immediate evils are those which one avoids.","而就索姆斯所知，直接的罪孽就是人们要回避的。"
"Indeed, only that tendency, inherited from his father, James, to lie awake between the hours of two and four, when the chrysalis of faint misgiving becomes so readily the butterfly of panic, had developed his uneasiness.","其实，单是从他父亲那里遗传来的秉性，已经让索姆斯的不安日益加深了。他会在夜里2点到4点间惊醒，然后他蠢蠢欲动的小担忧就会变成大恐慌，像蝴蝶一样破茧而出。"
"The P.P.R.S. was so imposing a concern, and he had been connected with it so short a time, that it seemed presumptuous to smell a rat; especially as he would have to leave the Board and the thousand a year he earned on it if he raised smell of rat without rat or reason.","天佑再保险公司是这么有影响力的一家大公司，而他加入公司的时间尚短，如果就此怀疑它有问题未免显得冒昧，尤其是如果他光说有问题却找不出问题或是理由的话，他就可能得离开董事会和那一千英镑的年薪。"
"But what if there were a rat?","但是要是真的有问题怎么办？"
"That was the trouble!","难就难在这里了！"
"And here sat ‘Old Mont’ talking of his spinneys and his grandfather.","而“老蒙特”却坐在这里谈着他的丛林打猎和他的祖父。"
"The fellow’s head was too small!","这家伙的脑瓜太小了！"
"And visited by the cheerless thought: ‘There’s nobody here, not even my own daughter, capable of taking a thing seriously,’ he kept silence.","然后他脑子里又涌现出一个让人压抑的念头：“在座的所有人，甚至包括我女儿在内，没有一个人会严肃对待事情。”他不吭声了。"
"A sound at his elbow roused him.","这时，肘边的声音惊动了他。"
"That marmoset of a dog, on a chair between him and his daughter, was sitting up!","他和他女儿之间的椅子上的那只像“狨”一样的小狗居然坐起来了！"
"Did it expect him to give it something?","这是盼着他能给点儿吃的吗？"
"Its eyes would drop out one of these days.","它那双眼珠早晚有一天会掉出来的。"
"And he said: “Well, what do YOU want?”","于是他问道：“喂，你想要什么？”"
"The way the little beast stared with those boot-buttons!","看看这小畜生的那副样子，瞪着它那对靴扣般大小的眼睛！"
"“Here,” he said, offering it a salted almond.","“来，”他一边说，一边拿了一颗盐渍杏仁给它，"
"“You don’t eat these.”","“你不吃这些东西的。”"
"Ting-a-ling did.","小叮铃吃了。"
"“He has a passion for them, Dad.","“爸爸，它挺爱吃那个的。"
"Haven’t you, darling?”","对不对啊，小宝贝？”"
"Ting-a-ling turned his eyes up at Soames, through whom a queer sensation passed.","小叮铃抬眼望着索姆斯，从那双眼睛里，索姆斯体会到一种怪异的感觉。"
"‘Believe the little brute likes me,’ he thought, ‘he’s always looking at me.’","“我认为这小畜生喜欢我，”他想，“它总是看着我。”"
"He touched the dog’s nose with the tip of his finger.","他用指尖碰了碰狗鼻子。"
"Ting-a-ling gave it a slight lick with his curly blackish tongue.","小叮铃用它那黑乎乎的卷舌头舔了他一下。"
"“Poor fellow!” muttered Soames involuntarily, and turned to ‘Old Mont.’","“可怜的小东西！”索姆斯不禁咕哝了一声，然后转向“老蒙特”。"
"“Don’t mention what I said.”","“别再提我刚才的话了。”"
"“My dear Forsyte, what was that?”","“刚才的什么话，亲爱的福赛特？”"
"Good Heavens!","天啊！"
"And he was on a Board with a man like this!","他居然和这样的人同在一个董事会里！"
"What had made him come on, when he didn’t want the money, or any more worries—goodness knew.","这人为何加入董事会——他又不在乎那点儿钱，也不想操那份心——天晓得。"
"As soon as he had become a director, Winifred and others of his family had begun to acquire shares to neutralise their income tax—seven per cent, preference—nine per cent, ordinary—instead of the steady five they ought to be content with.","自从他当上了董事，威妮弗雷德和家里的其他人就开始买股票来抵消他们的所得税——优先股百分之七，普通股百分之九——以此取代原先他们本该满足的稳定的百分之五。"
"There it was, he couldn’t move without people following him.","你看，他一动就会有人跟着动。"
"He had always been so safe, so perfect a guide in the money maze!","过去，在金钱的迷宫里，他一直是位非常稳妥和精确的向导！"
"To be worried at his time of life!","他都这把年纪了还在操心！"
"His eyes sought comfort from the opal at his daughter’s neck—pretty thing, pretty neck!","他的目光落在女儿衣领上的那颗蛋白石上，借此寻求安慰——漂亮的玩意！漂亮的脖子！"
"Well!","啊！"
"She seemed happy enough—had forgotten her infatuation of two years ago!","她显得很开心——已经忘记两年前的迷恋了！"
"That was something to be thankful for.","这是件令人欣慰的事情。"
"What she wanted now was a child to steady her in all this modern scrimmage of twopenny-ha’penny writers and painters and musicians.","她现在需要的是一个孩子，这样她就能在那些时尚的骚闹中安定下来，不再纠缠于那些微不足道的作家、画家和音乐家了。"
"A loose lot, but she had a good little head on her.","她虽然是一个放浪不羁的人，但是小脑瓜还是挺管用的。"
"If she had a child, he would put another twenty thousand into her settlement.","要是她有孩子了，他会在赠与她的财产上再加上两万英镑。"
"That was one thing about her mother—steady in money matters, good French method.","这是她母亲的一个优点——把钱管得很稳，优秀的法国方式。"
"And Fleur—so far as he knew—cut her coat according to her cloth.","至于弗勒——据他所知——是量入为出的。"
"What was that?","他们在说什么？"
"The word ‘Goya’ had caught his ear.","耳朵里钻进一个词——“戈雅”。"
"New life of him coming out?","他的新传记要出版了吗？"
"H’m!","哈！"
"That confirmed his slowly growing conviction that Goya had reached top point again.","那就更坚定了他那慢慢增强的信念——戈雅已经再次攀上顶峰。"
"“Think I shall part with that,” he said, pointing to the picture.","“我正想着把那东西卖掉，”他一边说，一边指着那幅画，"
"“There’s an Argentine over here.”","“来了个阿根廷人。”"
"“Sell your Goya, sir?”","“您要把您那幅戈雅卖掉吗，先生？”"
"It was Michael speaking.","迈克尔说道，"
"“Think of the envy with which you’re now regarded!”","“想想人们对您的尊敬和羡慕吧！”"
"“One can’t have everything,” said Soames.","“人总不能拥有一切吧。”索姆斯说。"
"“That reproduction we’ve got for ‘The New Life’ has turned out first-rate.","“我们给《新生活》做的那张复制品已经是一流的了。"
"‘Property of Soames Forsyte, Esquire.’","‘索姆斯·福赛特先生收藏’。"
"Let’s get the book out first, sir, anyway.”","先生，无论如何，等书出来再说吧。”"
"“Shadow or substance, eh, Forsyte?”","“虚名还是实名，嗯，福赛特？”"
"Narrow-headed baronet chap—was he mocking?","这头脑狭窄的准男爵，他是在嘲笑我吗？"
"“I’VE no family place,” he said.","“我可没有世袭的爵位。”他说。"
"“No, but we have, sir,” murmured Michael; “you could leave it to Fleur, you know.”","“可我们有啊，先生，”迈克尔小声嘀咕，“您可以把它留给弗勒，这您知道的。”"
"“Well,” said Soames, “we shall see if that’s worth while.”","“嗯，”索姆斯说，“我们还要看看这么做值不值。”"
"And he looked at his daughter.","他一边说着，一边看着他女儿。"
"Fleur seldom blushed, but she picked up Ting-a-ling and rose from the Spanish table.","弗勒难得地脸红了，抱起小叮铃，从那张西班牙式的餐桌旁站了起来。"
"Michael followed suit.","迈克尔也跟着站起来了。"
"“Coffee in the other room,” he said.","“咖啡在另一间屋里。”他说。"
"‘Old Forsyte’ and ‘Old Mont’ stood up, wiping their moustaches.","“老福赛特”和“老蒙特”站了起来，捋着他们的胡子。"

"Chapter VII","第七章"
"‘Old Mont’ and ‘Old Forsyte’","“老蒙特”和“老福赛特”"
"The offices of the P.P.R.S. were not far from the College of Arms.","天佑再保险公司的办事处离纹章院不远。","编者注：英国纹章院（College of Arms）于1484年建立。在12世纪就已有纹章官（Herald）的出现。开始时，纹章官类似依附于贵族之奴仆，地位相当于魔术师及吟游诗人。后来被当成比武会上的司仪，宣布比武项目及骑士名单。为识别骑士，必须对盾牌上之盾纹有所了解及认识，因而产生了纹章艺术的知识和技能。13世纪时，纹章官主要的工作是处理贵族事务。到了14世纪，纹章官之权力有所扩大。15世纪初，最高纹章官（Kings of Arms）已能授命给低级贵族颁赠封号。到了国王停止直接授与纹章时，此一权力便由纹章院代行。"


"Soames, who knew that ‘three dexter buckles on a sable ground gules’ and a ‘pheasant proper’ had been obtained there at some expense by his Uncle Swithin in the ‘sixties of the last century, had always pooh-poohed the building, until, about a year ago, he had been struck by the name Golding in a book which he had absently taken up at the Connoisseurs’ Club.","索姆斯记得在上世纪60年代，他的叔叔斯威森在那里花了一大笔钱淘到了一个“带有三个盾形右侧扣的黑底红色”纹章和一个“纯色雉鸡”纹章。因此，他总是对这幢建筑物不屑一顾。一直到大约一年前，在鉴赏家俱乐部里，他无意间从一本书里发现了戈尔丁的名字，不禁大吃一惊。"
"The affair purported to prove that William Shakespeare was really Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford.","他找这本书意在证实威廉·莎士比亚的确就是爱德华·德·威尔，牛津伯爵。"
"The mother of the earl was a Golding—so was the mother of Soames!","伯爵的母亲来自戈尔丁家族——与索姆斯的母亲同宗！"
"The coincidence struck him; and he went on reading.","这个巧合引起了他的兴趣，他继续阅读下去。"
"The tome left him with judgment suspended over the main issue, but a distinct curiosity as to whether he was not of the same blood as Shakespeare.","尽管这本书使他对主要问题的判断仍然犹豫不定，但是却引发了他对自己是否和莎士比亚同属一个血统的明显好奇。"
"Even if the earl were not the bard, he felt that the connection could only be creditable, though, so far as he could make out, Oxford was a shady fellow.","即使此伯爵并非彼诗人，但他还是觉得这种联系令人信服，尽管据他现在的了解，牛津伯爵是一位疑点重重的人物。"
"Recently appointed on the Board of the P.P.R.S., so that he passed the college every other Tuesday, he had thought: ‘Shan’t go spending a lot of money on it, but might look in one day.’","最近，由于被任命为天佑再保险公司的董事，他隔周的星期二都要经过纹章院。他心想：“没必要在这方面花费太多，但哪天可以进去瞧瞧。”"
"Having looked in, it was astonishing how taken he had been by the whole thing.","可是当他进去之后，他对一切事物的迷恋程度令人震惊。"
"Tracing his mother had been quite like a criminal investigation, nearly as ramified and fully as expensive.","追溯他母亲的家世就像进行刑事侦查——错综复杂、全面彻底、耗资甚大。"
"Having begun, the tenacity of a Forsyte could hardly bear to leave him short of the mother of Shakespeare de Vere, even though she would be collateral; unfortunately, he could not get past a certain William Gouldyng, Ingerer—whatever that might be, and he was almost afraid to enquire—of the time of Oliver Cromwell.","从一开始，福赛特家族倔强的脾性就使他不能放弃调查莎士比亚·德·威尔的母亲，即便她也许是旁系血统；但不幸的是，他追查到奥利弗·克伦威尔时代的一个人，那人名叫威廉·古尔丁·英格勒——管他到底可能叫什么，他几乎不敢去追究他到底姓甚名谁——就再也进行不下去了。"
"There were still four generations to be unravelled, and he was losing money and the hope of getting anything for it.","仍有四代人需要调查清楚，但是他已经花费不少了，而且也不再奢望能够从中获得什么重要东西了。"
"This it was which caused him to gaze askance at the retired building while passing it on his way to the Board on the Tuesday after the lunch at Fleur’s.","周二在弗勒家吃过午饭后，他在去董事会的路上经过这幢僻静的建筑时，只是斜眼瞅了瞅，原因就在于此了。"
"Two more wakeful early mornings had screwed him to the pitch of bringing his doubts to a head and knowing where he stood in the matter of the P.P.R.S.; and this sudden reminder that he was spending money here, there and everywhere, when there was a possibility, however remote, of financial liability somewhere else, sharpened the edge of a nerve already stropped by misgivings.","连续两个无眠的清晨迫使他要尽早把这些谜团解开，同时也必须要搞清楚现在自己在天佑再保险公司所处的地位。他突然想到，自己四处花钱，有可能已经在某个地方背负债务了，尽管这个可能性微乎其微，但这种压力使他那本来因为担惊受怕而饱受折磨的神经变得更加脆弱敏感。"
"Neglecting the lift and walking slowly up the two flights of stairs, he ‘went over’ his fellow-directors for the fifteenth time.","他不坐电梯，慢慢爬了两层楼梯，此时在他脑海里已经对那些董事会的同事们做了第十五次分析。"
"Old Lord Fontenoy was there for his name, of course; seldom attended, and was what they called ‘a dud’—h’m!—nowadays; the chairman, Sir Luke Sharman, seemed always to be occupied in not being taken for a Jew.","当然，老勋爵福坦诺能进入董事会是因为他的名声，他难得出席会议，而且最近被称作“废物”。董事长卢克·沙曼爵士似乎整天都在想着不要被人误认为是犹太人。"
"His nose was straight, but his eyelids gave cause for doubt.","他的鼻梁直挺，可眼皮不免引人怀疑。"
"His surname was impeccable, but his Christian dubious; his voice was reassuringly roughened, but his clothes had a suspicious tendency towards gloss.","他的姓氏没有问题，但是他的教名却让人怀疑；他的嗓音粗糙，让人放心，但他的衣着却有可疑的虚饰倾向。"
"Altogether a man who, though shrewd, could not be trusted—Soames felt—to be giving his whole mind to other business.","整体来看，索姆斯认为这个人虽然精明，但绝不能指望他全心全意专注于其他事务。"
"As for ‘Old Mont’—what was the good of a ninth baronet on a Board?","至于“老蒙特”——董事会里安排一个第九代准男爵有什么好处呢？"
"Guy Meyricke, King’s Counsel, last of the three who had been ‘together,’ was a good man in court, no doubt, but with no time for business and no real sense of it!","英国王室法律顾问盖伊·迈里克，是曾经“一起读过书”的三人中的最后一名。毫无疑问，他在法庭上表现优秀，但对于做生意可以说是既没时间又没常识！"
"Remained that converted Quaker, old Cuthbert Mothergill—whose family name had been a by-word for successful integrity throughout the last century, so that people still put Mothergills on to boards almost mechanically—rather deaf, nice clean old chap, and quite bland, but nothing more.","剩下的是那个改变了信仰的教友派信徒，老卡思伯特·莫德吉尔——他家族的名字在上世纪一直是廉洁正直的代名词，所以如今人们依旧机械地把莫德吉尔家的人安排在董事会中——一个耳背、谨慎、干净的老人，为人温和，别无其他。"
"A perfectly honest lot, no doubt, but perfunctory.","毫无疑问，这群人为人诚实，但却敷衍了事。"
"None of them really giving their minds to the thing!","他们当中没有一个人真正把心思放在事业上！"
"In Elderson’s pocket, too, except perhaps Sharman, and he on the wobble.","这些人都在埃尔德森的控制下，或许沙曼除外，但是他也是摇摆不定。"
"And Elderson himself—clever chap, bit of an artist, perhaps; managing director from the start, with everything at his finger-tips!","埃尔德森本人——是个聪明的家伙，也许还有点儿艺术家的风度，从一开始就担任总经理，业务上样样精通！"
"Yes!","对！"
"That was the mischief!","事情坏就坏在这里！"
"Prestige of superior knowledge, and years of success—they all kowtowed to him, and no wonder!","渊博的知识和多年的成功，使他具有一定的威望——他们都对他唯命是从，这不足为奇！"
"Trouble with a man like that was that if he once admitted to having made a mistake he destroyed the legend of his infallibility.","但是像他那样的人有这么一种麻烦，一旦他承认自己犯过错误，那自然就毁掉了他一贯正确的传奇。"
"Soames had enough infallibility of his own to realise how powerful was its impetus towards admitting nothing.","索姆斯自己也算是个一贯正确的人，所以他深知这种不肯承认错误的抑制力是多么强大。"
"Ten months ago, when he had come on to the Board, everything had seemed in full sail; exchanges had reached bottom, so they all thought—the ‘reassurance of foreign contracts’ policy, which Elderson had initiated about a year before, had seemed, with rising exchanges, perhaps the brightest feather in the cap of possibility.","10个月前，他来参加董事会时，似乎一切都顺风顺水，汇率跌到了谷底，大家都认为——埃尔德森一年前倡导的“国外合同再保险”政策会随着汇率上涨而变成最值得炫耀的业绩。"
"And now, a twelvemonth later, Soames suspected darkly that they did not know where they were—and the general meeting only six weeks off!","而如今，12个月后，索姆斯暗暗怀疑他们是否清楚自己所背负的风险——而且距离召开股东大会只剩下六周的时间了！"
"Probably not even Elderson knew; or, if he did, he was keeping knowledge which ought to belong to the whole directorate severely to himself.","或许，就连埃尔德森本人都不了解事态；又或者，假如他了解，那么他就是把本应对全体董事会成员宣布的事封锁起来，让它成为秘密。"
"He entered the board room without a smile.","他面无表情地走进董事会。"
"All there—even Lord Fontenoy and ‘Old Mont’—given up his spinneys, had he!","所有的人都在——甚至福坦诺勋爵和“老蒙特”也在——“老蒙特”居然放弃了打猎！"
"Soames took his seat at the end on the fireside.","索姆斯走到火炉边的位子上坐下。"
"Staring at Elderson, he saw, with sudden clearness, the strength of the fellow’s position; and, with equal clearness, the weakness of the P.P.R.S. With this rising and falling currency, they could never know exactly their liability—they were just gambling.","他凝视着埃尔德森，忽然清楚地意识到这个人的地位是多么有利。同时，他也清楚地意识到了天佑再保险公司是多么不堪一击。货币忽涨忽跌，但他们从来没意识到他们肩负的债务——他们只是一味地投机。"
"Listening to the minutes and other routine business, with his chin clasped in his hand, he let his eyes move from face to face—old Mothergill, Elderson, Mont opposite; Sharman at the head; Fontenoy, Meyricke, back to himself—decisive board of the year.","他一手托着下巴，听着会议内容和其他例行汇报，眼睛扫视着在场的每个人——老莫德吉尔、埃尔德森、坐在对面的蒙特、坐在上座的沙曼、福坦诺、迈里克，最后回到自己——这可是今年的一次决定性会议。"
"He could not, must not, be placed in any dubious position!","他不能，也绝不可以置身于一个模棱两可的立场了！"
"At his first general meeting on this concern, he must not face the shareholders without knowing exactly where he stood.","他第一次参加这样的股东大会，绝不能在面对股东时没有自己鲜明的立场。"
"He looked again at Elderson—sweetish face, bald head rather like Julius Caesar’s, nothing to suggest irregularity or excessive optimism—in fact, somewhat resembling that of old Uncle Nicholas Forsyte, whose affairs had been such an example to the last generation but one.","他又看了埃尔德森一眼——和善的面庞，光秃的头倒是和尤利乌斯·恺撒有几分相像，表情正常，也没有过分乐观的迹象——实际上，他很像老尼古拉斯·福赛特叔叔，对于上上一代人来说，他的事迹是很好的榜样。"
"The managing director having completed his exposition, Soames directed his gaze at the pink face of dosey old Mothergill, and said:","总经理刚刚汇报完，索姆斯就将目光投在昏昏欲睡的老莫德吉尔那张红润的脸上，他说："
"“I’m not satisfied that these accounts disclose our true position.","“我认为这些账目没有如实反映我们的实际情况。"
"I want the Board adjourned to this day week, Mr. Chairman, and during the week I want every member of the Board furnished with exact details of the foreign contract commitments which do NOT mature during the present financial year.","董事长，我要求董事会休会至下周这个时间再继续召开。这一周内，我要求根据本财政年度还没到期的国外合同协议，做出正确详细的报告，并交给董事会的每一位成员。"
"I notice that those are lumped under a general estimate of liability.","我还留意到那些还没到期的钱款都已合并到负债总款之中了。"
"I am not satisfied with that.","我不赞同这样做。"
"They ought to be separately treated.”","应该把那些没到期的款项分出来。”"
"Shifting his gaze past Elderson to the face of ‘Old Mont,’ he went on: “Unless there’s a material change for the better on the Continent, which I don’t anticipate (quite the contrary), I fully expect those commitments will put us in Queer Street next year.”","他的目光掠过埃尔德森转到“老蒙特”的脸上。他继续说：“除非欧洲大陆情况确实好转，而我认为不会有好转（恰恰相反），我敢肯定，那些协议明年就会使我们陷入经济困境。”"
"The scraping of feet, shifting of legs, clearing of throats which accompany a slight sense of outrage greeted the words ‘Queer Street’; and a sort of satisfaction swelled in Soames; he had rattled their complacency, made them feel a touch of the misgiving from which he himself was suffering.","“陷入经济困境”的说法引发了大家轻微的怒火，席间传来了脚搓地声、翘着的两腿移动的声响，还有几声清喉声，这使得索姆斯心上涌起一种满足感。他扰乱了他们安于现状的打算，使他们也感受到一点点正在煎熬他的忧虑担心。"
"“We have always treated our commitments under one general estimate, Mr. Forsyte.”","“我们一向都把所有钱款归在一起计算的，福赛特先生。”"
"Plausible chap!","花言巧语的家伙！"
"“And to my mind wrongly.","“但我认为这是错误的。"
"This foreign contract business is a new policy.","这种国外合同业务是一种新兴业务。"
"For all I can tell, instead of paying a dividend, we ought to be setting this year’s profits against a certain loss next year.”","依我看，现在我们不应该发股息，反而要把今年的利润预备着抵偿明年的某笔亏损。”"
"Again that scrape and rustle.","又是一阵刚才那样的骚动声。"
"“My dear sir, absurd!”","“我亲爱的先生，这简直是荒谬！”"
"The bulldog in Soames snuffled.","索姆斯犹如斗牛犬的鼻子发出呼哧呼哧的声音。"
"“So you say!” he said.","“随你去说！”他说，"
"“Am I to have those details?”","“那我能看到那些详细账目吗？”"
"“The Board can have what details it likes, of course.","“当然了，董事会要看什么账目都可以。"
"But permit me to remark on the general question that it CAN only be a matter of estimate.","但允许我就基本问题说明一下，这只是一种估算。"
"A conservative basis has always been adopted.”","估算时，我们向来都是采取保守的态度。”"
"“That is a matter of opinion,” said Soames; “and in my view it should be the Board’s opinion after very careful discussion of the actual figures.”","“这是见仁见智的问题，”索姆斯说，“并且依我看，该用什么态度，这应该由董事会在认真讨论过实际数字后才决定吧。”"
"‘Old Mont’ was speaking.","“老蒙特”开口了。"
"“My dear Forsyte, to go into every contract would take us a week, and then get us no further; we can but average it out.”","“我亲爱的福赛特，如果我们仔细研究每一份合同，那就得花费一周的时间，也许还不会有任何结果，我们也只是大概计算一个均值。”"
"“What we have not got in these accounts,” said Soames, “is the relative proportion of foreign risk to home risk—in the present state of things a vital matter.”","“但在这些账目里，我没有看到，”索姆斯说，“国外投资风险对本国投资风险的相关比例——这在现阶段是一个尤为关键的问题。”"
"The Chairman spoke.","董事长说话了。"
"“There will be no difficulty about that, I imagine, Elderson!","“埃尔德森，我想应该不会有太大问题吧！"
"But in any case, Mr. Forsyte, we should hardly be justified in penalising the present year for the sake of eventualities which we hope will not arise.”","但不管怎样，福赛特先生，我们为了预防将来可能发生的不测——尽管我们希望不会发生这样的事——而取消今年股息的发放，恐怕这不合情理吧。"
"“I don’t know,” said Soames.","“我不知道，”索姆斯说，"
"“We are here to decide policy according to our common sense, and we must have the fullest opportunity of exercising it.","“在这里我们是根据常识来决定方针政策的，而且我们必须有运用常识的最充分的机会。"
"That is my point.","这就是我的观点。"
"We have not enough information.”","我们没有足够的信息。”"
"That ‘plausible chap’ was speaking again:","那个“花言巧语的家伙”又开口了："
"“Mr. Forsyte seems to be indicating a lack of confidence in the management.”","“福赛特先生似乎表现出对于管理层的不信任。”"
"Taking the bull by the horns—was he?","他是在铤而走险吗？"
"“Am I to have that information?”","“我究竟能否获得那些信息呢？”"
"The voice of old Mothergill rose cosy in the silence.","老莫德吉尔悦耳的声音划破了一片沉寂。"
"“The Board could be adjourned, perhaps, Mr. Chairman; I could come up myself at a pinch.","“董事长，或许董事会可以休会，如果必要的话，我还会出席的。"
"Possibly we could all attend.","我们也许都可以参加。"
"The times are very peculiar—we mustn’t take any unnecessary risks.","这次情况极为特殊——我们绝对不能冒任何不必要的风险。"
"The policy of foreign contracts is undoubtedly somewhat new to us.","对于我们来说，国外合同方针毫无疑问是新鲜事物。"
"We have no reason so far to complain of the results.","到目前为止，我们还没有理由对结果有所抱怨。"
"And I am sure we have the utmost confidence in the judgment of our managing director.","我可以肯定地说，我们对我们总经理的判断能力绝对有信心。"
"Still, as Mr. Forsyte has asked for this information, I think perhaps we ought to have it.","但是，既然福赛特先生已经提出要这样一份资料，那我想我们或许应该有这样一份材料。"
"What do you say, my lord?”","你说呢，勋爵？”"
"“I can’t come up next week.","“下周我来不了。"
"I agree with the chairman that on these accounts we couldn’t burke this year’s dividend.","我同意董事长的说法，按照现在的账目，我们不能克扣今年的股息。"
"No good getting the wind up before we must.","不到万不得已，没必要草木皆兵。"
"When do the accounts go out, Elderson?”","账目什么时候能有结果，埃尔德森？”"
"“Normally at the end of this week.”","“一切顺的话，本周末就有结果了。”"
"“These are not normal times,” said Soames.","“现在可不是一切顺利。”索姆斯说，"
"“To be quite plain, unless I have that information I must tender my resignation.”","“开诚布公地说，假如我拿不到这份材料，那我就只好提出辞职了。”"
"He saw very well what was passing in their minds.","他非常了解他们脑子里都想些什么。"
"A newcomer making himself a nuisance—they would take his resignation readily—only it would look awkward just before a general meeting unless they could announce “wife’s ill-health” or something satisfactory, which he would take very good care they didn’t.","新人总是很麻烦——他们会非常愿意接受他的辞呈的——只是在开股东大会之前出现这样的情况，不免有些尴尬，除非他们以“夫人身体欠佳”或类似令人心服口服的理由为借口，但是他会很小心避免他们利用这些借口的。"
"The chairman said coldly:","董事长冷冷地说："
"“Well, we will adjourn the Board to this day week; you will be able to get us those figures, Elderson?”","“那好吧，董事会休会，下周这个时间再召开；到时账目能有结果了吗，埃尔德森？”"
"“Certainly.”","“肯定能。”"
"Into Soames’ mind flashed the thought: ‘Ought to ask for an independent scrutiny.’","索姆斯脑海里闪过这样一个念头：“应该请求做一次独立审查。”"
"But he looked round.","但是他环顾四周。"
"Going too far—perhaps—if he intended to remain on the Board—and he had no wish to resign—after all, it was a big thing, and a thousand a year!","如果他打算继续留在这里的话，这样做确实有些过分了——何况他并不想辞职——毕竟，这是份好差事，一年1000英镑的收入啊！"
"No!","不！"
"Mustn’t overdo it!","千万不能做得太过分！"
"Walking away, he savoured his triumph doubtfully, by no means sure that he had done any good.","他一边走，一边略带怀疑地品味着自己的胜利，他根本就不能确定这样做是否能给他带来好处。"
"His attitude had only closed the ‘all together’ attitude round Elderson.","他这样做只是把他们和埃尔德森更加紧密地绑在了一起。"
"The weakness of his position was that he had nothing to go on, save an uneasiness, which when examined was found to be simply a feeling that he hadn’t enough control himself.","他所处境地的不利因素就在于，除了疑虑的感觉外，他缺乏切实有力的证据，而且仔细考虑一下，就不难看出这纯粹是他感情用事。"
"And yet, there couldn’t be two managers—you must trust your manager!","除此以外，一个公司总不可能有两个经理吧——你必须要相信你的经理！"
"A voice behind him tittupped: “Well, Forsyte, you gave us quite a shock with your alternative.","他背后响起了一个欢快的声音：“喂，福赛特，刚才你提到不查账就辞职时，我们真是吓了一大跳。"
"First time I remember anything of the sort on that Board.”","我记得在董事会还是第一次发生这样的事。”"
"“Sleepy hollow,” said Soames.","“这个地方让人打不起精神。”索姆斯说。"
"“Yes, I generally have a nap.","“是啊，我总是打瞌睡。"
"It gets very hot in there.","那里面太热了。"
"Wish I’d stuck to my spinneys.","要是能到丛林里就好了。"
"They come high, even as early as this.”","即使现在这么早的时候，丛林也已经长得很茂盛了。”"
"Incurably frivolous, this tittupping baronet!","俗不可耐，这个轻浮的准男爵！"
"“By the way, Forsyte, I wanted to say: With all this modern birth control and the rest of it, one gets uneasy.","“顺便说一声，福赛特，我想说的是，面对这些现代的节制生育和其他与之相关的事情，确实使人不安啊。"
"We’re not the royal family; but don’t you feel with me it’s time there was a movement in heirs?”","我们不是皇室家族，但你是不是也认为该动员大家传宗接代了？”"
"Soames did, but he was not going to confess to anything so indelicate about his own daughter.","索姆斯有同感，但这事关他自己女儿的名声，所以他不想袒露心声。"
"“Plenty of time,” he muttered.","“时间还多着呢。”他嘀咕着。"
"“I don’t like that dog, Forsyte.”","“福赛特，我不喜欢那条狗。”"
"Soames stared.","索姆斯瞪起眼睛。"
"“Dog!” he said.","“狗！”他说，"
"“What’s that to do with it?”","“它跟这事有什么关系？”"
"“I like a baby to come before a dog.","“我希望先有孩子再养狗。"
"Dogs and poets distract young women.","狗和诗人一样，会使年轻的女人分心。"
"My grandmother had five babies before she was twenty-seven.","我的祖母在27岁前就已经有5个孩子了。"
"She was a Montjoy; wonderful breeders, you remember them—the seven Montjoy sisters—all pretty.","她是一位芒乔伊家的人，出色的芒乔伊家的后代，你记得她们吧——那七个芒乔伊姐妹——每一个都很漂亮。"
"Old Montjoy had forty-seven grandchildren.","老芒乔伊有47个孙儿。"
"You don’t get it nowadays, Forsyte.”","福赛特，如今不可能有这样的事了。”"
"“Country’s over-populated,” said Soames grimly.","“国家人口过剩了。”索姆斯恶狠狠地说。"
"“By the wrong sort—less of them, more of ourselves.","“多了些不该多的人——像他们那种人应该减少，而我们这种人得增加一些。"
"It’s almost a matter for legislation.”","这应该是通过立法规定的事情。”"
"“Talk to your son,” said Soames.","“跟你儿子说去吧。”索姆斯说。"
"“Ah! but they think us fogeys, you know.","“是啊！但你应该知道，他们肯定认为我们因循守旧。"
"If we could only point to a reason for existence.","假如我们能够说出生存的原因就好了。"
"But it’s difficult, Forsyte, it’s difficult.”","但这很难，福赛特，难啊。”"
"“They’ve got everything they want,” said Soames.","“他们已经要什么有什么了。”索姆斯说。"
"“Not enough, my dear Forsyte, not enough; the condition of the world is on the nerves of the young.","“这还不够，我亲爱的福赛特，这些还不够，当今世界的形势使这些年轻人感到局促不安。"
"England’s dished, they say, Europe’s dished.","英国被打败了，他们说，欧洲完蛋了。"
"Heaven’s dished, and so is Hell!","天堂完蛋了，地狱也完蛋了！"
"No future in anything but the air.","除了空气，任何事情都没有希望了。"
"You can’t breed in the air; at least, I doubt it—the difficulties are considerable.”","你不能在忐忑中抚养后代吧，至少，我觉得不行——困难重重啊。”"
"Soames sniffed.","索姆斯哼了一声。"
"“If only the journalists would hold their confounded pens,” he said; for, more and more of late, with the decrescendo of scare in the daily Press, he was regaining the old sound Forsyte feeling of security.","“但愿新闻媒体业者能够控制那令人生厌的笔。”他说。因为最近一段时间，日报上的恐慌消息愈加减少，他也恢复了福赛特家的古老祥和的安全感。"
"“We’ve only to keep clear of Europe,” he added.","“我们只要不管欧洲的事情就好了。”他补充了一句。"
"“Keep clear and keep the ring!","“既不介入但又保持中立！"
"Forsyte, I believe you’ve hit it.","福赛特，你这话算是说着了。"
"Good friendly terms with Scandinavia, Holland, Spain, Italy, Turkey—all the outlying countries that we can get at by sea.","与斯堪的纳维亚、荷兰、西班牙、意大利、土耳其——所有那些我们能够通过航海到达的遥远国家保持友好关系。"
"And let the others dree their weirds.","让其他国家听天由命。"
"It’s an idea!”","这可是个好主意！”"
"How the chap rattled on!","这家伙怎么这么喋喋不休！"
"“I’m no politician,” said Soames.","“我可不是政治家。”索姆斯说。"
"“Keep the ring!","“保持中立！"
"The new formula.","这是个新原则。"
"It’s what we’ve been coming to unconsciously!","这正是我们一直没有察觉而又一直在做的！"
"And as to trade—to say we can’t do without trading with this country or with that—bunkum, my dear Forsyte.","至于贸易——说我们非得跟这个或那个国家进行贸易往来——都是在瞎说，我亲爱的福赛特。"
"The world’s large—we can.”","世界很大——我们能这样做。”"
"“I don’t know anything about that,” said Soames.","“我一点儿也不了解此事，”索姆斯说，"
"“I only know we must drop this foreign contract assurance.”","“我只知道，我们必须舍弃这个国外合同保险。”"
"“Why not confine it to the ring countries?","“为什么不把买卖控制在那些可控制的国家范围内呢？"
"Instead of ‘balance of power,’ ‘keep the ring’!","不是‘势力均衡’，而是‘保持中立！’"
"Really, it’s an inspiration!”","这可是一条妙计啊！”"
"Thus charged with inspiration, Soames said hastily:","一条妙计涌上心头，索姆斯匆忙地说："
"“I leave you here, I’m going to my daughter’s.”","“在这儿跟你分手吧，我要去女儿家。”"
"“Ah!","“啊！"
"I’m going to my son’s.","我要去儿子家。"
"Look at these poor devils!”","看看这些苦命的人！”"
"Down by the Embankment at Blackfriars a band of unemployed were trailing dismally with money-boxes.","一群失业的人手捧钱盒子，在泰晤士河堤旁的黑衣修士桥上慢慢地走着，神情忧郁。"
"“Revolution in the bud!","“革命正在萌芽！"
"There’s one thing that’s always forgotten, Forsyte, it’s a great pity.”","有件事总是被忘记，福赛特，这真令人太遗憾了。”"
"“What’s that?” said Soames, with gloom.","“什么事？”索姆斯阴郁地说。"
"The fellow would tittup all the way to Fleur’s!","这家伙看样子要一路喋喋不休到弗勒家！"
"“Wash the working-class, put them in clean, pleasant-coloured jeans, teach ‘em to speak like you and me, and there’d be an end of class feeling.","“给那些工人洗洗身，给他们穿上整洁、漂亮的工装裤，教他们像咱们这样与人交流，这样就没有等级感觉了。"
"It’s all a matter of the senses.","这完全是一个感觉问题。"
"Wouldn’t you rather share a bedroom with a clean, neat-clothed plumber’s assistant who spoke and smelled like you than with a profiteer who dropped his aitches and reeked of opoponax?","你是愿意跟一个穿着干净整齐，谈吐像你我这样的管道工助手同睡一间屋呢，还是喜欢跟一个言语粗俗，浑身散发恶臭的投机奸商同睡一起呢？"
"Of course you would.”","你当然愿意跟前者了。”"
"“Never tried,” said Soames, “so don’t know.”","“我从来没试过，”索姆斯说，“所以我不知道。”"
"“Pragmatist!","“实用主义者！"
"But believe me, Forsyte—if the working class would concentrate on baths and accent instead of on their political and economic tosh, equality would be here in no time.”","但请相信我，福赛特——要是工人们能把精力转到洗澡和发音训练上，而不是就政治和经济胡言乱语，那么就会立刻实现平等。”"
"“I don’t want equality,” said Soames, taking his ticket to Westminster.","“我不需要平等。”索姆斯说着，买了一张去威斯敏斯特的车票。"
"The ‘tittupping’ voice pursued him entering the tube lift.","那个“喋喋不休”的声音一直跟随他进入地铁的电梯。"
"“Aesthetic equality, Forsyte, if we had it, would remove the wish for any other.","“福赛特，我们一旦拥有了审美平等，我们就不会再要求其他任何平等了。"
"Did you ever catch an impecunious professor wishing he was the King?”","你遇到过幻想变成国王的穷教授吗？”"
"“No,” said Soames, opening his paper.","“从没有。”索姆斯一边说，一边翻开报纸。"

"Chapter VIII","第八章"
"Bicket","比克特"
"Beneath its veneer of cheerful irresponsibility, the character of Michael Mont had deepened during two years of anchorage and continuity.","成家立业的这两年，使迈克尔·蒙特表面上玩世不恭的性格变得多了几分稳重。"
"He had been obliged to think of others; and his time was occupied.","他不得不顾及到周围人的事情，而且他把时间安排得满满的。"
"Conscious, from the fall of the flag, that he was on sufferance with Fleur, admitting as whole the half-truth: ‘Il y a toujours un qui baise, et l’autre qui tend la joue,’ he had developed real powers of domestic consideration; and yet he did not seem to redress the balance in his public or publishing existence.","自从他向弗勒妥协的那天起，他就意识到要时时处处对弗勒忍让。他完全认同那句有一定道理的名言：“世界上既然存在亲吻别人的人，那就存在伸出面颊让别人吻的人。”他在家中事事体贴，关心家人，却似乎无法平衡他的公众角色和出版人角色。"
"He found the human side of his business too strong for the monetary.","他感觉自己在处理事情上过分注重人情关系，而不是金钱。"
"Danby and Winter, however, were bearing up against him, and showed, so far, no signs of the bankruptcy prophesied for them by Soames on being told of the principles which his son-inlaw intended to introduce.","然而，丹比&温特出版社还在靠他费力支撑着，而且就目前情况来看，没有丝毫破产的迹象——当初索姆斯在听了他自己女婿想要采取一些策略时，做出过这样的断言。"
"No more in publishing than in any other walk of life was Michael finding it possible to work too much on principle.","迈克尔发现，出版业与其他任何行业一样，不能太循规蹈矩了。"
"The field of action was so strewn with facts—human, vegetable and mineral.","在行动领域处处是客观事实——人、植物，还有矿物。"
"On this same Tuesday afternoon, having long tussled with the price of those vegetable facts, paper and linen, he was listening with his pointed ears to the plaint of a packer discovered with five copies of ‘Copper Coin’ in his overcoat pocket, and the too obvious intention of converting them to his own use.","就在这周二的下午，在他卖力地就蔬菜、纸张和布料的价格讨价还价过后，他竖起耳朵倾听着一个包装工人的哭诉，因为人们在他的外套口袋里发现了五本《铜币》，显然他要将它们占为己有。"
"Mr. Danby had ‘given him the sack’—he didn’t deny that he was going to sell them, but what would Mr. Mont have done?","丹比先生已经把他解雇了——这个工人也没有否认他要把这几本书卖掉，但如果事情放在蒙特先生身上的话，他又会怎样做呢？"
"He owed rent—and his wife wanted nourishing after pneumonia—wanted it bad.","他欠了房租——他的妻子在肺炎初痊后要及时补充营养——他很需要钱。"
"‘Dash it!’ thought Michael, ‘I’d snoop an edition to nourish Fleur after pneumonia!’","“见鬼！”迈克尔想，“假若弗勒肺炎后需要补充营养，我肯定会偷走整套书换钱给她买。”"
"“And I can’t live on my wages with prices what they are.","“如今物价这么高，光靠这点儿工资根本养活不了全家。"
"I can’t, Mr. Mont, so help me!”","蒙特先生，我真的活不下去了，快救救我吧！”"
"Michael swivelled.","迈克尔在转椅上转来转去。"
"“But look here, Bicket, if we let you snoop copies, all the packers will snoop copies; and if they do, where are Danby and Winter?","“可是你想想，比克特，假如我默许了你的偷书行为，那就意味着默许所有的包装工人偷书了，如果大家都这么做，那丹比&温特出版社会怎么样？"
"In the cart.","关门啦。"
"And, if they’re in the cart, where are all of you?","再说，出版社关门，大家去哪儿？"
"In the street.","上街流浪。"
"It’s better that one of you should be in the street than that all of you should, isn’t it?”","与其大家流落大街，不如你们中间的一个人去，难道不是吗？”"
"“Yes, sir, I quite see your point—it’s reason; but I can’t live on reason, the least thing knocks you out, when you’re on the bread line.","“是啊，先生，我明白您的话——很有道理，但道理不能当饭吃，肚子吃不饱的时候，人就容易干傻事。"
"Ask Mr. Danby to give me another chance.”","请您帮我求求丹比先生，让他再给我一次机会。”"
"“Mr. Danby always says that a packer’s work is particularly confidential, because it’s almost impossible to keep a check on it.”","“丹比先生总是说，包装工人的工作特别需要诚信，因为我们无法监督它。”"
"“Yes, sir, I should feel that in future; but with all this unemployment and no reference, I’ll never get another job.","“您说的对，先生，今后我一定记着您的话，但是看看如今普遍失业的现象，我又没有推荐信，我肯定是不可能再找到工作的。"
"What about my wife?”","那我的妻子怎么活啊？”"
"To Michael it was as if he had said “What about Fleur?”","迈克尔听到这句话，就如同自己在说：“弗勒怎么办？”"
"He began to pace the room; and the young man Bicket looked at him with large dolorous eyes.","他在屋里走来走去，年轻的比克特用忧伤的大眼睛注视着他。"
"Presently he came to a standstill, with his hands deep plunged into his pockets and his shoulders hunched.","过了一会儿，他停了下来，双手深深地插在口袋里，耸起肩膀。"
"“I’ll ask him,” he said; “but I don’t believe he will; he’ll say it isn’t fair on the others.","“我跟他求求情，”他说，“但我不保证他会同意，他也许会说这样做对别人不公平。"
"You had five copies; it’s pretty stiff, you know—means you’ve had ‘em before, doesn’t it?","你这次拿了五本书，情况不乐观，你清楚——这就意味着你以前干过，是不是？"
"What?”","嗯？”"
"“Well, Mr. Mont, anything that’ll give me a chance, I don’t mind confessin’.","“唉，蒙特先生，假如能再给我一次机会，我愿意坦白一切。"
"I have ‘ad a few previous, and it’s just about kept my wife alive.","我以前的确拿过几本，但那都是为了救我妻子的命。"
"You’ve no idea what that pneumonia’s like for poor people.”","您根本无法想象肺炎对于贫困人家意味着什么。”"
"Michael pushed his fingers through his hair.","迈克尔用手捋着头发。"
"“How old’s your wife?”","“你妻子多大了？”"
"“Only a girl—twenty.”","“很年轻——刚刚20岁。”"
"Twenty!","20岁！"
"Just Fleur’s age!","正好和弗勒同岁！"
"“I’ll tell you what I’ll do, Bicket; I’ll put it up to Mr. Desert; if he speaks for you, perhaps it may move Mr. Danby.”","“比克特，我告诉你我打算怎么做。我会把这件事告诉德赛特先生，要是他肯替你求情，也许丹比先生会同意。”"
"“Well, Mr. Mont, thank you—you’re a gentleman, we all sy that.”","“嗯，蒙特先生，非常感谢您——您是位好人，我们都这么说。”"
"“Oh! hang it!","“啊！该死！"
"But look here, Bicket, you were reckoning on those five copies.","比克特，你完全是靠这五本书接济。"
"Take this to make up, and get your wife what’s necessary.","把这个拿去贴补生活吧，给你妻子买些必需品。"
"Only for goodness’ sake don’t tell Mr. Danby.”","但你千万别告诉丹比先生。”"
"“Mr. Mont, I wouldn’t deceive you for the world—I won’t sy a word, sir.","“蒙特先生，我肯定不会欺骗您的——先生，我绝对不会透漏半个字的。"
"And my wife—well!”","至于我的妻子——咳！”"
"A sniff, a shuffle—Michael was alone, with his hands plunged deeper, his shoulders hunched higher.","一声鼻子吸溜声和一阵拖沓的脚步声过后，屋里只剩下迈克尔一人了。他双手往口袋里插得更深，肩膀耸得更高。"
"And suddenly he laughed.","突然，他笑了起来。"
"Pity!","怜悯！"
"Pity was pop!","怜悯是时髦！"
"It was all dam’ funny.","这一切真滑稽。"
"Here he was rewarding Bicket for snooping ‘Copper Coin!’","比克特偷了《铜币》，他反而奖赏了他！"
"A sudden longing possessed him to follow the little packer and see what he did with the two pounds—see whether ‘the pneumonia’ was real or a figment of the brain behind those dolorous eyes.","他忽然特别想尾随着这个小包装工，看看他究竟怎么花这两镑钱——看看那“肺炎”是真的呢，还是这个有着一双忧伤眼睛的人捏造出来的。"
"Impossible, though!","可是，这不可能！"
"Instead he must ring up Wilfrid and ask him to put in a word with old Danby.","他倒是必须得给威尔弗里德打电话，请他在老丹比那里美言几句。"
"His own word was no earthly.","他的话不管用了。"
"He had put it in too often!","他替人说情说得太多了！"
"Bicket!","比克特！"
"Little one knew of anybody, life was deep and dark, and upside down!","人们对旁人知之甚少，生活深奥费解，是非颠倒！"
"What was honesty?","诚实算什么？"
"Pressure of life versus power of resistance—the result of that fight, when the latter won, was honesty!","生活的压力与反抗的力量对抗——后者胜利了，那么这场战斗的结果才叫诚实！"
"But why resist?","但为什么反抗呢？"
"Love thy neighbour as thyself—but not more!","爱人如己——但适可而止！"
"And wasn’t it a darned sight harder for Bicket on two pounds a week to love him, than for him on twenty-four pounds a week to love Bicket?...","让一周赚两镑的比克特关爱他，比让一周赚二十四镑的他关爱比克特要难得多，不是吗？……"
"“Hallo!...","“喂！……"
"That you, Wilfrid?...","威尔弗里德，是你吗？……"
"Michael speaking....","我是迈克尔……"
"One of our packers has been sneaking copies of ‘Copper Coin.’","我们这有个包装工人偷了几本《铜币》。"
"He’s ‘got the sack’—poor devil!","他已经被解雇了——真可怜！"
"I wondered if you’d mind putting in a word for him—old Dan won’t listen to me... yes, got a wife—Fleur’s age; pneumonia, so he says.","我不知道你愿不愿意替他求求情——老丹比不听我的……是啊，他有一个妻子——跟弗勒同龄，他说她得了肺炎。"
"Won’t do it again with yours anyway, insurance by common gratitude—what!...","无论如何下次不会再偷书了，用我和他共同的感激之情作担保——什么！……"
"Thanks, old man, awfully good of you—will you bob in, then?","非常感谢，老朋友，你真是太善良了——你马上就到吗？"
"We can go round home together... Oh!","我们一起回家吧……啊！"
"Well!","好啊！"
"You’ll bob in anyway.","你无论如何一定要来。"
"Aurev!”","再见！”"
"Good chap, old Wilfrid!","威尔弗里德真够朋友！"
"Real good chap—underneath!","他是真正的好朋友——打心眼里说！"
"Underneath—what?","打心眼里说——是什么呢？"
"Replacing the receiver, Michael saw a sudden great cloud of sights and scents and sounds, so foreign to the principles of his firm that he was in the habit of rejecting instantaneously every manuscript which dealt with them.","放下电话，迈尔克忽然发现一大堆有关景象、气味和声音的稿件。这些稿件与他出版社的原则相悖，所以他习惯性地立即将它们退回。"
"The war might be ‘off ‘; but it was still ‘on’ within Wilfrid, and himself.","战争也许“结束”了，但在威尔弗里德的内心和他本人的战争继续着。"
"Taking up a tube, he spoke:","他拿起电话，说道："
"“Mr. Danby in his room?","“丹比先生在吗？"
"Right!","好的！"
"If he shows any signs of flitting, let me know at once.”...","如果他要出去，请立刻通知我。”……"
"Between Michael and his senior partner a gulf was fixed, not less deep than that between two epochs, though partially filled in by Winter’s middle-age and accommodating temperament.","迈克尔和那位年长的合伙人之间存在一定代沟，其深度不亚于两个时代的距离。不过温特先生人到中年，脾气温和，或多或少弥补了一些隔阂。"
"Michael had almost nothing against Mr. Danby except that he was always right—Philip Norman Danby, of Sky House, Campden Hill, a man of sixty and some family, with a tall forehead, a preponderance of body to leg, and an expression both steady and reflective.","除了认为他永远正确之外，迈克尔对丹比先生几乎没有什么异议——菲利普·诺曼·丹比住在坎普登山上的摩天大厦，年已六十，出身名门，有着高高的前额，身材魁梧，神情坚定而又善于深思。"
"His eyes were perhaps rather close together, and his nose rather thin, but he looked a handsome piece in his well-proportioned room.","或许他的眼睛长得有些太靠近了，鼻子又略微瘦削，但从他比例恰当的五官来看，他倒是位英俊的男子。"
"He glanced up from the formation of a correct judgment on a matter of advertisement when Wilfrid Desert came in.","他正在埋头斟酌批阅一项广告业务，威尔弗里德·德赛特走进来，他抬头看了他一眼。"
"“Well, Mr. Desert, what can I do for you?","“嗯，德赛特先生，有什么能为您效劳的？"
"Sit down!”","请坐！”"
"Desert did not sit down, but looked at the engravings, at his fingers, at Mr. Danby, and said:","德赛特没坐下，而是看看那几幅版画，看看自己的手指，又看看丹比先生，说道："
"“Fact is, I want you to let that packer chap off, Mr. Danby.”","“丹比先生，我来这儿的目的就是想让您对那个包装工人高抬贵手。”"
"“Packer chap.","“包装工人。"
"Oh!","哦！"
"Ah!","啊！"
"Bicket.","比克特。"
"Mont told you, I suppose?”","我猜是蒙特告诉您的吧？”"
"“Yes; he’s got a young wife down with pneumonia.”","“是啊，他的妻子年纪轻轻，得了肺炎。”"
"“They all go to our friend Mont with some tale or other, Mr. Desert—he has a very soft heart.","“德赛特先生，他们编了好多故事去哄骗我们的朋友蒙特——他心肠太软了。"
"But I’m afraid I can’t keep this man.","但是恐怕我不能留下这个人。"
"It’s a most insidious thing.","这样做后患无穷。"
"We’ve been trying to trace a leak for some time.”","为了找出这个漏洞，我们已经花费很长时间了。”"
"Desert leaned against the mantelpiece and stared into the fire.","德赛特斜倚着壁炉架，眼睛盯着炉火。"
"“Well, Mr. Danby,” he said, “your generation may like the soft in literature, but you’re precious hard in life.","“嗯，丹比先生，”他说，“你们那一代人也许喜欢文学中所具有的宽厚仁爱，但在实际生活中你们却是如此冷酷无情。"
"Ours won’t look at softness in literature, but we’re a deuced sight less hard in life.”","而我们这一代人呢，虽然对文学中具有的宽厚仁爱不屑一顾，但在实际生活中却显得软弱无能。”"
"“I don’t think it’s hard,” said Mr. Danby, “only just.”","“我可不认为这是冷酷无情，”丹比先生说，“这仅代表公正。”"
"“Are you a judge of justice?”","“您是一位公正的法官吗？”"
"“I hope so.”","“我希望如此。”"
"“Try four years’ hell, and have another go.”","“您去体验一下四年的地狱生活，再回来试试。”"
"“I really don’t see the connection.","“我确实看不出这之间有什么联系。"
"The experience you’ve been through, Mr. Desert, was bound to be warping.”","德赛特先生，你所体验的生活肯定是不同寻常的。”"
"Wilfrid turned and stared at him.","威尔弗里德转身盯着他。"
"“Forgive my saying so, but sitting here and being just is much more warping.","“请原谅我这样说话，但是坐在这里自诩公正就更不正常了。"
"Life is pretty good purgatory, to all except about thirty percent. of grown-up people.”","对于成年人来说，除了他们中的30%，生活简直就是炼狱。”"
"Mr. Danby smiled.","丹比先生笑了笑。"
"“We simply couldn’t conduct our business, my dear young man, without scrupulous honesty in everybody.","“没有了最起码的诚实，亲爱的年轻人，我们这一行根本维持不下去。"
"To make no distinction between honesty and dishonesty would be quite unfair.","不区分诚实与否是很不公平的。"
"You know that perfectly well.”","这一点你应该很清楚。”"
"“I don’t know anything perfectly well, Mr. Danby; and I mistrust those who say they do.”","“丹比先生，我对任何事情都不甚了解，而且我也不信任那些标榜什么都清楚的人。”"
"“Well, let us put it that there are rules of the game which must be observed, if society is to function at all.”","“好吧，换句话说，社会要想运作，那么每个行业就一定会有必须遵守的规章原则。”"
"Desert smiled, too: “Oh! hang rules!","德赛特也笑了：“啊！该死的原则！"
"Do it as a favour to me.","就算帮我一次。"
"I wrote the rotten book.”","谁让我写了那本破书呢。”"
"No trace of struggle showed in Mr. Danby’s face; but his deep-set, close-together eyes shone a little.","丹比先生的脸上仍然平静，不过他那双深陷的、聚拢的眼睛闪了闪。"
"“I should be only too glad, but it’s a matter—well, of conscience, if you like.","“能帮您的忙是我的荣幸，但这是一个——关乎良心的问题，可以这么说。"
"I’m not prosecuting the man.","我不想起诉那个人。"
"He must leave—that’s all.”","但是他必须得离开——仅此而已。”"
"Desert shrugged his shoulders.","德赛特耸了耸肩膀。"
"“Well, good-bye!” and he went out.","“好吧，再见！”说着他走了出去。"
"On the mat was Michael in two minds.","迈克尔站在脚垫上，进退为难。"
"“Well?”","“怎么样？”"
"“No go.","“没戏。"
"The old blighter’s too just.”","那个老家伙太公正了。”"
"Michael stivered his hair.","迈克尔挠了挠头发。"
"“Wait in my room five minutes while I let the poor beggar know, then I’ll come along.”","“在我屋里等五分钟，我去告诉那个可怜的家伙，然后咱俩一起走。”"
"“No,” said Desert, “I’m going the other way.”","“不，”德赛特说，“咱俩不顺道。”"
"Not the fact that Wilfrid was going the other way—he almost always was—but something in the tone of his voice and the look on his face obsessed Michael’s imagination while he went downstairs to seek Bicket.","迈克尔跑下楼找比克特的时候，心里起了猜疑，让他困惑的并不是威尔弗里德的不顺道——他几乎总是这样——而是他说话时的语气和表情。"
"Wilfrid was a rum chap—he went “dark” so suddenly!","威尔弗里德是个古怪的家伙——一下子变得“阴郁”了！"
"In the nether regions he asked:","到了地下车间，他问："
"“Bicket gone?”","“比克特走了吗？”"
"“No, sir, there he is.”","“没有，先生，他还在那里。”"
"There he was, in his shabby overcoat, with his pale narrow face, and his disproportionately large eyes, and his sloping shoulders.","他站在那里，穿着一件破旧的大衣，苍白瘦长的脸上长着一双不成比例的大眼睛，肩膀耷拉着。"
"“Sorry, Bicket, Mr. Desert has been in, but it’s no go.”","“非常抱歉，比克特，德赛特先生去替你求情了，但是很遗憾行不通。”"
"“No, sir?”","“行不通吗，先生？”"
"“Keep your pecker up, you’ll get something.”","“振作起来，你会找到工作的。”"
"“I’m afryde not, sir.","“恐怕找不到了，先生。"
"Well, I thank you very ‘eartily; and I thank Mr. Desert.","嗯，我从心里感谢您，也感谢德赛特先生。"
"Good-night, sir; and good-bye!”","晚安，先生，再见！”"
"Michael watched him down the corridor, saw him waver into the dusky street.","迈克尔看着他从走廊向外走去，看见他摇摇晃晃地走进一条阴暗的街道。"
"“Jolly!” he said, and laughed....","“妙极了！”他说着笑了起来……"
"The natural suspicions of Michael and his senior partner that a tale was being pitched were not in fact justified.","迈克尔和他那年长的合伙人对这个让人心生怜悯的故事产生的合理怀疑其实是有失公允的。"
"Neither the wife nor the pneumonia had been exaggerated; and wavering away in the direction of Blackfriars Bridge, Bicket thought not of his turpitude nor of how just Mr. Danby had been, but of what he should say to her.","无论是他的妻子，还是肺炎，都是确凿的事实。此时，比克特正摇晃着身子朝黑衣修士桥走去，他想的不是自己的堕落，也不是丹比先生在此事上坚决的态度，而是回到家里应该如何向妻子交代。"
"He should not, of course, tell her that he had been detected in stealing; he must say he had ‘got the sack for cheeking the foreman’; but what would she think of him for doing that, when everything as it were depended on his not cheeking the foreman?","当然，他是肯定不会告诉妻子自己因为偷窃被当场发现而被开除，他必须说是“因为顶撞领班而被解雇的”。但是如今他不应该去顶撞领班，而他又偏偏这么做了，妻子对他会有什么想法呢？"
"This was one of those melancholy cases of such affection that he had been coming to his work day after day feeling as if he had ‘left half his guts’ behind him in the room where she lay, and when at last the doctor said to him:","他对妻子的爱已经到了一种忧郁的状态，以至于他每天去上班的时候，感觉自己“半个灵魂”留在了妻子躺着的那间屋里。当医生最后跟他说："
"“She’ll get on now, but it’s left her very run down—you must feed her up,” his anxiety had hardened into a resolution to have no more.","“她会慢慢恢复好的，但这场疾病使她非常虚弱——你必须给她加强营养。”他的种种忧虑一下子变成了坚定的决心，不让自己再忧虑徘徊。"
"In the next three weeks he had ‘pinched’ eighteen ‘Copper Coins,’ including the five found in his overcoat.","在接下来的三周里，他一共“扔掉”18本《铜币》，包括在他大衣里发现的那5本。"
"He had only ‘pitched on’ Mr. Desert’s book because it was ‘easy sold,’ and he was sorry now that he hadn’t pitched on some one else’s.","他只“选中”德赛特的书，缘于这本书“容易卖”，他现在真后悔为什么当初没有选中其他作者的书。"
"Mr. Desert had been very decent.","德赛特先生非常慷慨。"
"He stopped at the corner of the Strand, and went over his money.","他在斯特兰德大街的拐角站住，数了数钱。"
"With the two pounds given him by Michael and his wages he had seventy-five shillings in the world, and going into the Stores he bought a meat jelly and a tin of Benger’s food that could be made with water.","加上迈克尔给的两镑钱和工资，他一共有75先令。他走进百货商店，买了一瓶肉冻和一罐加水即食的本杰牌食品。"
"With pockets bulging he took a ‘bus, which dropped him at the corner of his little street on the Surrey side.","他口袋鼓鼓的，坐上了公共汽车，在萨里区边上他住的那条街道的拐角处下车。"
"His wife and he occupied the two ground floor rooms, at eight shillings a week, and he owed for three weeks.","他和妻子住在底层两间屋里，一周租金八先令，而他已经欠了三周租金了。"
"‘Py that!’ he thought, ‘and have a roof until she’s well.’","“付了吧！”他想，“住到她痊愈了再说吧。”"
"It would help him over the news, too, to show her a receipt for the rent and some good food.","再说，他拿着结租金的收据和好吃的给妻子，也好帮助他说出那个消息。"
"How lucky they had been careful to have no baby!","他们一直没有生养小孩，真是万幸！"
"He sought the basement.","他来到地下室。"
"His landlady was doing the week’s washing.","房东太太正在洗一周堆积的衣服。"
"She paused, in sheer surprise at such full and voluntary payment, and inquired after his wife.","她怔了一下，对他一下子那么主动地付清租金大为惊讶，接着询问了他妻子的情况。"
"“Doing nicely, thank you.”","“谢谢您，情况还不错。”"
"“Well, I’m glad of that, it must be a relief to your mind.”","“哦，这真让人高兴，这下你可以宽宽心了。”"
"“It is,” said Bicket.","“是啊。”比克特说。"
"The landlady thought: ‘He’s a thread-paper—reminds me of a shrimp before you bile it, with those eyes.’","房东太太心想：“他太瘦了——那双眼睛让我一下想到了没有煮过的虾。”"
"“Here’s your receipt, and thank you.","“给你，这是收据，谢谢你。"
"Sorry to ‘ave seemed nervous about it, but times are ‘ard.”","请原谅我曾经多次催你交房租，但是日子确实难以维持啊。”"
"“They are,” said Bicket.","“的确啊，”比克特说，"
"“So long!”","“再见！”"
"With the receipt and the meat jelly in his left hand, he opened the door of his front room.","他左手拿着肉冻和收据，右手推开了房门。"
"His wife was sitting before a very little fire.","他妻子正坐在一小盆炉火的前面。"
"Her bobbed black hair, crinkly towards the ends, had grown during her illness; it shook when she turned her head and smiled.","她的黑色短发发梢卷曲，自生病以来已经长长了不少。当她回头冲比克特微笑时，她的头发也跟着晃动起来。"
"To Bicket—not for the first time—that smile seemed queer, ‘pathetic-like,’ mysterious—as if she saw things that one didn’t see oneself.","对于比克特来说——这已经不是第一次了——她的微笑有些奇怪，略带忧伤，让人猜不透——好像她看到了旁人无法看到的东西。"
"Her name was Victorine, and he said: “Well, Vic.?","她叫维多琳。他说：“好些吗，维？"
"This jelly’s a bit of all right, and I’ve pyde the rent.”","肉冻看起来不错，而且房租也结了。”"
"He sat on the arm of the chair and she put her hand on his knee—her thin arm emerging blue-white from the dark dressing-gown.","他坐在椅子的扶手上，维多琳把手放在他的膝盖上——苍白细长的胳膊从深色睡衣里伸出来。"
"“Well, Tony?”","“你怎么样，托尼？”"
"Her face—thin and pale with those large dark eyes and beautifully formed eyebrows—was one that “looked at you from somewhere; and when it looked at you—well! it got you right inside!”","她的脸——苍白消瘦，上面有一双黑色的大眼睛和两道漂亮的弯眉——是那种“从某个地方看着你，而且它看着你的时候——嗯！就看透你的心思！”"
"It got him now and he said: “How’ve you been breathin’?”","此时此刻她就看透了他的心思。他说：“你这会儿呼吸感觉如何？”"
"“All right—much better.","“不错——比之前好多了。"
"I’ll soon be out now.”","再过一阵就能出门了。”"
"Bicket twisted himself round and joined his lips to hers.","比克特扭过身子，亲吻着维多琳。"
"The kiss lasted some time, because all the feelings which he had not been able to express during the past three weeks to her or to anybody, got into it.","他们吻了许久，这一吻包含了以前三周他对妻子或旁人无法表示的感情。"
"He sat up again, “sort of exhausted,” staring at the fire, and said: “News isn’t bright—lost my job, Vic.”","他重新坐好，说：“有些累了，”他盯着炉火，“维，有个坏消息，我被解雇了。”"
"“Oh!","“啊！"
"Tony!","托尼！"
"Why?”","为什么啊？”"
"Bicket swallowed.","比克特咽了一下唾沫。"
"“Fact is, things are slack, and they’re reducin’.”","“因为生意惨淡，公司裁员。”"
"There had surged into his mind the certainty that sooner than tell her the truth he would put his head under the gas!","他心里有个坚定的信念，宁愿把头放在煤气炉里自杀，也绝不能对妻子说实情。"
"“Oh! dear!","“啊！亲爱的！"
"What shall we do, then?”","那我们可怎么办啊？”"
"Bicket’s voice hardened.","比克特语气坚定起来。"
"“Don’t you worry—I’ll get something”; and he whistled.","“别担心——我会找着工作的。”说着，他还吹起了口哨。"
"“But you liked that job.”","“但你很喜欢那份工作。”"
"“Did I?","“是吗？"
"I liked some o’ the fellers; but as for the job—why, what was it?","我喜欢那里的同事，但是至于工作嘛——嗨，那算得了什么？"
"Wrappin’ books up in a bysement all dy long.","天天就是在地下室包装书本。"
"Let’s have something to eat and get to bed early—I feel as if I could sleep for a week, now I’m shut of it.”","我们吃完饭就早点儿休息吧——我感觉现在没有工作的束缚，可以睡上一整周呢。”"
"Getting their supper ready with her help, he carefully did not look at her face for fear it might “get him agyne inside!”","她帮他做好了晚饭，他尽量避免看妻子的脸，担心那会更“让他心痛”！"
"They had only been married a year, having made acquaintance on a tram, and Bicket often wondered what had made her take to him, eight years her senior and C3 during the war!","他们是在电车上认识的，结婚刚刚一年。比克特常常感觉新奇，究竟自己身上具有什么魅力，会让妻子嫁给自己！他大她八岁，而且大战期间体检结果是丙下！"
"And yet she must be fond of him, or she’d never look at him as she did.","但她一定是爱他的，要不然绝不会这样望着他。"
"“Sit down and try this jelly.”","“坐下尝尝刚买的肉冻。”"
"He himself ate bread and margarine and drank cocoa, he seldom had any particular appetite.","他自己吃面包抹黄油，喝可可，他很少吃其他特别的东西。"
"“Shall I tell you what I’d like?” he said; “I’d like Central Austrylia.","“我告诉你我喜欢什么吧？”他说，“我喜欢澳大利亚中部。"
"We had a book in there about it; they sy there’s quite a movement.","我们那儿有一本描述那个地方的书，书上说有很多人移民到那儿了。"

"“How much does it cost to get out there?”","“去那里要花多少钱呢？”"
"“A lot more than we can ly hands on, that’s the trouble.","“很多的钱，多得我们无法去，这是个难题。"
"But I’ve been thinkin’.","但我一直就想去那儿。"
"England’s about done.","英国快要衰败了。"
"There’s too many like me.”","像我这样的人数不胜数。”"
"“No,” said Victorine; “there aren’t enough.”","“不，”维多琳说，“像你的人可不多。”"
"Bicket looked at her face, then quickly at his plate.","比克特看看她，然后快速将目光移向盘子。"
"“What myde you take a fancy to me?”","“你怎么会喜欢我呢？”"
"“Because you don’t think first of yourself, that’s why.”","“因为你凡事总为别人着想，就是这个原因。”"
"“Used to before I knew you.","“在认识你之前，我是先考虑自己的。"
"But I’d do anything for you, Vic.”","但为了你，维，我愿意做任何事情。”"
"“Have some of this jelly, then, it’s awful good.”","“吃点儿肉冻吧，特别好吃。”"
"Bicket shook his head.","比克特摇摇头。"
"“If we could wyke up in Central Austrylia,” he said.","“假如一觉醒来，我们已经在澳大利亚中部了，那就好了。”他说，"
"“But there’s only one thing certain, we’ll wyke up in this blighted little room.","“但唯一有一件事我能肯定——我们一觉醒来肯定还会在这间破旧的小屋里。"
"Never mind, I’ll get a job and earn the money yet.”","没关系，我会找到工作的，挣够去那儿的钱的。”"
"“Could we win it on a race?”","“我们能不能赌马赚钱呢？”"
"“Well, I’ve only got forty-seven bob all told, and if we lose it, where’ll you be?","“哦，我现在一共就有47个先令，如果我们输了，你打算住哪儿？"
"You’ve got to feed up, you know.","你是知道的，你必须要多补充营养。"
"No, I must get a job.”","不行，我无论如何要找到一份工作。”"
"“They’ll give you a good recommend, won’t they?”","“他们会为你提供一份不错的介绍信吗？会不会呢？”"
"Bicket rose and stacked his plate and cup.","比克特站起来，把盘子和杯子摞起来。"
"“They would, but that job’s off—overstocked.”","“会的，但是那份工作不行了——干的人太多了。”"
"Tell her the truth?","告诉她实情吗？"
"Never!","绝不！"
"So help him!","上帝保佑！"
"In their bed, one of those just too wide for one and just not wide enough for two, he lay, with her hair almost in his mouth, thinking what to say to his Union, and how to go to work to get a job.","他躺在那张一人睡太宽、两人睡太窄的床上，她的头发几乎挨到他的嘴唇。他在心里盘算着该如何跟工会商讨，该怎样找份工作。"
"And in his thoughts as the hours drew on he burned his boats.","一个小时一个小时地过去了，他思来想去，决定要破釜沉舟。"
"To draw his unemployment money he would have to tell his Union what the trouble was.","想要失业救济金，就得跟工会说出困难所在。"
"Blow the Union!","该死的工会！"
"He wasn’t going to be accountable to them!","他不想去跟他们解释情况！"
"HE knew why he’d pinched the books; but it was nobody else’s business, nobody else could understand his feelings, watching her so breathless, pale and thin.","他自己非常清楚为什么会去偷书，但是这跟别人没关系。当他看着妻子呼吸困难、脸色苍白、身体消瘦，那种感觉没有人能够理解。"
"Strike out for himself!","只有依靠自己的拼搏！"
"And a million and a half out o’ work!","150万人都失业了！"
"Well, he had a fortnight’s keep, and something would turn up—and he might risk a bob or two and win some money, you never knew.","嗯，他们的生活还足以勉强维持两周，说不定会发生什么——他也许会拿一两个先令去冒冒险，说不定会赢钱，这谁都说不准。"
"She turned in her sleep.","她翻个身继续睡着。"
"‘Yes,’ he thought, ‘I’d do it agyne...’","“对，”他想，“我要再拼一下……”"
"Next day, after some hours on foot, he stood under the grey easterly sky in the grey street, before a plate-glass window protecting an assortment of fruits and sheaves of corn, lumps of metal, and brilliant blue butterflies, in the carefully golden light of advertised Australia.","隔天，走了几个小时后，在东方灰蒙蒙的天空下，他来到了灰色的街道。透过大玻璃橱窗，他看见各种各样的水果、一束束谷物、一块块的金属和色彩艳丽的蓝蝴蝶，这一切都映衬在金色的灯光下，原来这些精心布置都是为了宣传澳大利亚。"
"To Bicket, who had never been out of England, not often out of London, it was like standing outside Paradise.","比克特从来没有离开过英国半步，也很少离开伦敦，对他来说，这一切似乎意味着站在天堂之外。"
"The atmosphere within the office itself was not so golden, and the money required considerable; but it brought Paradise nearer to take away pamphlets which almost burned his hands, they were so warm.","办事处的气氛可不是那般宜人，咨询费很是昂贵。但当他拿走几乎烫手的那几本宣传册子时，似乎他离天堂又近了一步——那些宣传册子真是温暖人心。"
"Later, he and she, sitting in the one armchair—advantage of being thin—pored over these alchemised pages and inhaled their glamour.","过后，他和她挤坐在一张扶椅上——瘦人的优势——仔细端详着这些带着魔力的书，啧啧惊叹。"
"“D’you think it’s true, Tony?”","“你觉得这是真的吗，托尼？”"
"“If it’s thirty per cent. true it’s good enough for me.","“即便只有30%是真的，对我来说也够好的了。"
"We just must get there somehow.","我们必须想办法去那里。"
"Kiss me.”","亲一下。”"
"From around the corner in the main road the rumbling of the trams and carts, and the rattling of their window-pane in the draughty dry easterly wind increased their feeling of escape into a gas-lit Paradise.","从大街的拐角处传来了主路上电车和火车的隆隆声，屋里的窗户被强劲又干燥的东风吹得嘎吱作响。这周围的环境使他们愈发想要快些逃到那个点着煤气灯的天堂。"

"Chapter IX","第九章"
"Confusion","混乱"
"Two hours behind Bicket, Michael wavered towards home.","比克特离开两个小时以后，迈克尔摇摇摆摆地回家了。"
"Old Danby was right as usual—if you couldn’t trust your packers, you might shut up shop!","老丹比一如既往地正确——信不过自己店里的包装工，还是关店大吉吧！"
"Away from Bicket’s eyes, he doubted.","比克特走后，他心生疑虑了。"
"Perhaps the chap hadn’t a wife at all!","也许这家伙根本就没有妻子！"
"Then Wilfrid’s manner usurped the place of Bicket’s morals.","随后，比克特的道德问题让位给了威尔弗里德的怪异举止。"
"Old Wilfrid had been abrupt and queer the last three times of meeting.","最近三次会面，威尔弗里德老兄显得唐突而古怪。"
"Was he boiling-up for verse?","他是因为作诗而情绪不稳吗？"
"He found Ting-a-ling at the foot of the stairs in a conservative attitude.","他发现小叮铃在楼梯角那里一动不动，态度十分固执。"
"“I am not going up,” he seemed saying, “until some one carries me—at the same time it is later than usual!”","它似乎在说：“没人抱我，我就不上去，平时早就有人抱我上去了！”"
"“Where’s your mistress, you heraldic little beast?”","“女主人呢，你这个传令官小畜生？”"
"Ting-a-ling snuffled.","小叮铃抽了抽鼻子。"
"“I could put up with it,” he implied, “if YOU carried me—these stairs are laborious!”","它似乎在说：“如果抱我上去，我就不计较您这句话了。上楼梯太费劲了！”"
"Michael took him up.","迈克尔把它抱起来。"
"“Let’s go and find her.”","“咱们去找找她吧。”"
"Squeezed under an arm harder than his mistress’, Ting-a-ling stared as if with black-glass eyes; and the plume of his emergent tail quivered.","夹在比女主人更硬的手臂下，小叮铃瞪着它那黑玻璃球似的眼睛，尾巴翘起，上面的毛发微微颤动着。"
"In the bedroom Michael dropped him so absent-mindedly that he went to his corner plume pendent, and couched there in dudgeon.","到了卧室，迈克尔心不在焉地把它丢下，它便垂着尾巴走到自己的角落，愤愤地蹲在那里。"
"Nearly dinner time and Fleur not in!","快开饭了，弗勒还没回来！"
"Michael went over his sketchy recollection of her plans.","迈克尔把自己大概记得的她今天的日程安排回想了一遍。"
"To-day she had been having Hubert Marsland and that Vertiginist—what was his name?—to lunch.","今天，她约了休伯特·马斯兰德和那个旋转派画家——忘了他叫什么名字了——吃午饭。"
"There would have been fumes to clear off.","那里一定闹得乌烟瘴气，不可开交。"
"Vertiginists—like milk—made carbonic acid gas in the lungs!","旋转派画家，像牛奶一样，会在胃里制造碳酸气体！"
"Still!","还不回来！"
"Half-past seven!","都7点半了！"
"What was happening to-night?","难道今晚发生了什么事情？"
"Weren’t they going to that play of L.S.D.’s?","他们该不会去看L. S. D.写的那部戏了吧？"
"No—that was tomorrow!","不对呀，那是明天啊！"
"Was there conceivably nothing?","或许没什么事？"
"If so, of course she would shorten her unoccupied time as much as possible.","如果这样的话，她自然会尽量缩短非应酬的时间。"
"He made that reflection humbly.","他这么保守估计着。"
"Michael had no illusions, he knew himself to be commonplace, with only a certain redeeming liveliness, and, of course, his affection for her.","迈克尔没有任何奢望，他知道自己很普通，唯一可取之处就是活泼，当然，还有对她的爱。"
"He even recognised that his affection was a weakness, tempting him to fussy anxieties, which on principle he restrained.","他甚至认为对她的爱是自己的弱点，因为爱，他总是惶恐不安，原则却又极力克制这一点。"
"To enquire, for instance, of Coaker or Philps—their man and their maid—when she had gone out, would be thoroughly against that principle.","比如，他会向家里的仆人科克和菲尔普斯询问她何时出去的，这就完全违背了他的原则。"
"The condition of the world was such that Michael constantly wondered if his own affairs were worth paying attention to; but then the condition of the world was also such that sometimes one’s own affairs seemed all that were worth paying attention to.","世事就是如此，自己的事情是否值得关注，这常常让迈克尔困惑不已；可是，世事又是这样，有时，自己的事情才是唯一值得关心的。"
"And yet his affairs were, practically speaking, Fleur; and if he paid too much attention to them, he was afraid of annoying her.","可实际上，他的事只与弗勒有关，如果他抓得太紧，又怕惹恼了她。"
"He went into his dressing-room and undid his waistcoat.","他走进更衣室，脱下马甲。"
"‘But no!’ he thought; ‘if she finds me “dressed” already, it’ll put too much point on it.’","他心想：“不妥，如果她发现我‘穿戴整齐’，那未免做得太明显了。”"
"So he did up his waistcoat and went downstairs again.","所以，他又穿上马甲，又下楼去了。"
"Coaker was in the hall.","科克在门厅里。"
"“Mr. Forsyte and Sir Lawrence looked in about six, sir.","“先生，福赛特先生和劳伦斯爵士大约6点钟来过。"
"Mrs. Mont was out.","蒙特夫人已经出去了。"
"What time shall I serve dinner?”","您准备什么时候开饭？”"
"“Oh! about a quarter past eight.","“嗯，8点15分左右吧。"
"I don’t think we’re going out.”","我想我们不会出去了。”"
"He went into the drawing-room and passing down its Chinese emptiness, drew aside the curtain.","他走进客厅，在这间空荡荡的中国式房间里走着，拉开了窗帘。"
"The square looked cold and dark and draughty; and he thought: ‘Bicket—pneumonia—I hope she’s got her fur coat.’","外面起风了，广场显得又冷又黑，于是他想：“比克特——肺炎——希望她穿那件皮大衣了。”"
"He took out a cigarette and put it back.","他拿出一支烟，又放了回去。"
"If she saw him at the window she would think him fussy; and he went up again to see if she had put on her fur!","如果她发现我站在窗旁，她又会认为我大惊小怪了。于是他又上楼了，看看她穿没穿皮大衣！"
"Ting-a-ling, still couchant, greeted him plume dansetti arrested as at disappointment.","小叮铃仍旧蹲在那里，以为主人回来了，立刻摇尾表示欢迎，一看不对，又失望地停住了。"
"Michael opened a wardrobe.","迈克尔打开衣橱。"
"She had!","她穿了！"
"Good!","很好！"
"He was taking a sniff round, when Ting-a-ling passed him trottant, and her voice said: “Well, my darling!”","就在他打量衣橱时，小叮铃忽然从他身边走过，同时，响起了她的声音：“嗨，亲爱的！”"
"Wishing that he was, Michael emerged from behind the wardrobe door.","迈克尔希望这是在叫他，立刻从衣橱门后走出来。"
"Heaven!","天啊！"
"She looked pretty, coloured by the wind!","她太美了，被风吹红了面颊！"
"He stood rather wistfully silent.","他默然地站在那里，若有所思。"
"“Hallo, Michael!","“嗨，迈克尔！"
"I’m rather late.","我回来晚了。"
"Been to the Club and walked home.”","我去俱乐部了，走着回来的。”"
"Michael had a quite unaccountable feeling that there was suppression in that statement.","迈克尔有种说不出来的感觉，他认为弗勒对自己有所保留。"
"He also suppressed, and said: “I was just looking to see that you’d got your fur, it’s beastly cold.","他也有所保留，说道：“我刚才在那儿，是看你穿没穿大衣出去，天气挺冷的。"
"Your dad and Bart have been and went away fasting.”","你父亲和准爵爷来过，没吃饭就离开了。”"
"Fleur shed her coat and dropped into a chair.","弗勒脱下大衣，往椅子上一靠。"
"“I’m tired.","“我累了。"
"Your ears are sticking up so nicely to-night, Michael.”","迈克尔，今晚，你的耳朵竖得特别好看。”"
"Michael went on his knees and joined his hands behind her waist.","迈克尔跪了下去，双手搂着她的腰。"
"Her eyes had a strange look, a scrutiny which held him in suspense, a little startled.","她审视着他，眼神奇怪，让他感到不安，还有点儿摸不着头脑。"
"“If YOU got pneumonia,” he said, “I should go clean out of curl.”","“如果你染上肺炎，”他说，“那我就完了。”"
"“Why on earth should I?”","“为什么我偏要得这种病呢？”"
"“You don’t know the connection—never mind, it wouldn’t interest you.","“你不知道这其中的联系——没什么，你不会感兴趣的。"
"We’re not going out, are we?”","我们不出去了，是吗？”"
"“Of course we are.","“我们当然出去了。"
"It’s Alison’s monthly.”","今天是艾莉森的每月例会啊。”"
"“Oh!","“哦！"
"Lord!","哎呀！"
"If you’re tired we could cut that.”","如果你累了，我们可以不去。”"
"“My dear!","“亲爱的！"
"Impos.!","这可不行！"
"She’s got all sorts of people coming.”","她请了很多人来。”"
"Stifling a disparagement, he sighed out: “Right-o!","他忍下了一句轻蔑的话，叹了口气，说道：“那好吧！"
"War-paint?”","穿礼服吗？”"
"“Yes, white waistcoat.","“是的，还要穿白马甲。"
"I like you in white waistcoats.”","我喜欢看你穿白马甲。”"
"Cunning little wretch?","狡猾的小坏蛋！"
"He squeezed her waist and rose.","他紧紧抱了一下她的腰，然后站起身来。"
"Fleur laid a light stroke on his hand, and he went into his dressing-room comforted....","弗勒轻轻拍了一下他的手，他感到很满足，朝更衣室走去……"
"But Fleur sat still for at least five minutes—not precisely ‘a prey to conflicting emotions,’ but the victim of very considerable confusion.","可是，弗勒在那里静静地坐了至少五分钟——虽然不全是挣扎的情感所致，但却是目前极其混乱的局面造成的。"
"TWO men within the last hour had done this thing—knelt at her knees and joined their fingers behind her waist.","在刚才的一个小时里，两个男人在她面前做了同一件事情——跪在她膝前，搂住她的腰。"
"Undoubtedly she had been rash to go to Wilfrid’s rooms.","无疑，她去威尔弗里德家的举动过于鲁莽了。"
"The moment she got there she had perceived how entirely unprepared she really was to commit herself to what was physical.","她一到那里，就发现自己并非想要委身于肉欲。"
"True he had done no more than Michael.","他所做的也不过同迈克尔刚才一样。"
"But—Goodness!—she had seen the fire she was playing with, realised what torment he was in.","可是——天哪！——她发觉自己在玩火，也意识到了他的痛苦。"
"She had strictly forbidden him to say a word to Michael, but intuitively she knew that in his struggle between loyalties she could rely on nothing.","她告诫他，绝对不能对迈克尔透露一个字，但她的直觉告诉她，如果要他在情和义中间选一个，她毫无胜算。"
"Confused, startled, touched, she could not help a pleasant warmth in being so much loved by two men at once, nor an itch of curiosity about the upshot.","她感到混乱、惊恐、还有感动，想到同时被两个男人这样深爱着，一丝愉快的暖意不由得涌上心头。她对未来也充满好奇，渴望知道结局。"
"And she sighed.","她不禁叹了口气。"
"She had added to her collection of experiences—but how to add further without breaking up the collection, and even perhaps the collector, she could not see.","她增加了一份收藏经验——但是如何进一步增加，而不破坏整个收藏乃至收藏者，她却不知道。"
"After her words to Wilfrid before the Eve: “You will be a fool to go—wait!” she had known he would expect something before long.","自从上次在夏娃画像前，她对威尔弗里德说了“你要是走了，你就是个傻瓜。等着！”之后，她知道他会期待不久的将来发生什么事情。"
"Often he had asked her to come and pass judgment on his ‘junk.’","他经常请她帮忙鉴定他的“旧货”。"
"A month, even a week, ago she would have gone without thinking more than twice about it, and discussed his ‘junk’ with Michael afterwards!","要是在一个月前，哪怕是一周前，她会想也不想就去了，事后还会和迈克尔讨论这些“旧货”！"
"But now she thought it over many times, and but for the fumes of lunch, and the feeling, engendered by the society of the ‘Vertiginist,’ of Amabel Nazing, of Linda Frewe, that scruples of any kind were ‘stuffy,’ sensations of all sorts ‘the thing,’ she would probably still have been thinking it over now.","可是现在，她却反复考虑这件事了，一直到乌烟瘴气的午餐会上，“旋转派画家”、阿玛贝尔·内津和琳达·弗鲁的讨论提醒了她——任何性质的顾虑都是“乏味的”，各种各样的感觉才是“正事”——她可能到现在都想不明白呢。"
"When they departed, she had taken a deep breath and her telephone receiver from the Chinese tea chest.","大家走后，她才深吸了一口气，同时打开中国式茶柜，拿出电话听筒。"
"If Wilfrid were going to be in at half-past five, she would come and see his ‘junk.’","如果威尔弗里德五点半在家的话，她就去看他的“旧货”。"
"His answer: “My God!","他回答道：“上帝啊！"
"Will you?” almost gave her pause.","你会来吗？”这又让她踌躇了。"
"But dismissing hesitation with the thought: ‘I WILL be Parisian—Proust!’ she had started for her Club.","但是，她用“我一定要有普鲁斯特式的巴黎气派”排解了自己的踌躇，动身去了俱乐部。"
"Three-quarters of an hour, with no more stimulant than three cups of China tea, three back numbers of the ‘Glass of Fashion,’ three back views of country members ‘dead in chairs,’ had sent her forth a careful quarter of an hour behind her time.","俱乐部里没有更令她兴奋的事可做，只是在三刻钟的时间里喝了三杯茶，看了三本过期的《时装镜》，看了“三个呆坐在椅子上”的乡村会员的背影，然后特意比约定时间晚了一刻钟动身了。"
"On the top floor Wilfrid was standing in his open doorway, pale as a soul in purgatory.","他家的门敞开着，威尔弗里德站在楼顶，脸色苍白，就像饱受煎熬的幽灵。"
"He took her hand gently, and drew her in.","他轻轻地拉牵着她的手，引她进去。"
"Fleur thought with a little thrill: ‘Is this what it’s like?","弗勒有点儿激动，她想：“这事就像这样吗？"
"Du cote de chez Swann!’","在斯万家里！”"
"Freeing her hand, she began at once to flutter round the ‘junk,’ clinging to it piece by piece.","她松开手，即刻开始打量那些“旧货”，着迷地一件件看起来。"
"Old English ‘junk’ rather manorial, with here and there an eastern or First Empire bit, collected by some bygone Desert, nomadic, or attached to the French court.","这些古老的英国“旧货”颇有点儿庄园气息，其中还散落着几件东方或是第一帝国时期的物件，东西是某个德赛特先人的藏品，这位收藏者若不是一位流浪者，就是曾经出入法兰西宫廷的人。"
"She was afraid to sit down, for fear that he might begin to follow the authorities; nor did she want to resume the intense talk of the Tate Gallery.","弗勒不敢坐下，怕他会顺势对自己做出越矩的行为；她也不愿意继续他们在泰特美术馆的那场激烈的谈话。"
"‘Junk’ was safe, and she only looked at him in those brief intervals when he was not looking at her.","看“旧货”显得很安全，在他不看她的瞬间，她才瞟他一眼。"
"She knew she was not playing the game according to ‘La Garconne’ and Amabel Nazing; that, indeed, she was in danger of going away without having added to her sensations.","她知道自己没按照《独身女人》和阿玛贝尔·内津的方式耍手段；事实上，她明白这样离开，会一无所获。"
"And she couldn’t help being sorry for Wilfrid; his eyes yearned after her, his lips were bitter to look at.","她禁不住为威尔弗里德而忧伤；他的目光充满渴望，双唇饱含了苦涩。"
"When at last from sheer exhaustion of ‘junk’ she sat down, he had flung himself at her feet.","后来，她实在看累了，就坐了下来，这时，威尔弗里德扑到她的脚旁。"
"Half hypnotised, with her knees against his chest, as safe as she could hope for, she really felt the tragedy of it—his horror of himself, his passion for herself.","她陷入了半梦半醒的状态，用双膝顶着他的胸部，希望这种方式会尽可能安全些。她感觉到了事态的严重性——他如此不顾自己，如此迷恋她。"
"It was painful, deep; it did not fit in with what she had been led to expect; it was not in the period, and how—how was she to get away without more pain to him and to herself?","这是撕心裂肺的痛苦，这种做法不符合大家对她的期望，这种爱也不为这个时代所接受——要怎样脱身，才不会增加彼此的痛苦呢？"
"When she HAD got away, with one kiss received but not answered, she realised that she had passed through a quarter of an hour of real life, and was not at all sure that she liked it....","带着她无法回应的一吻离开后，她才意识到刚才那一刻钟才是真爱的生活，但对于自己是否喜欢这种生活，她还不确定……"
"But now, safe in her own room, undressing for Alison’s monthly, she felt curious as to what she would have been feeling if things had gone as far as was proper according to the authorities.","此刻，她终于安全地呆在自己的房间里，为参加艾莉森的每月例会更衣。她很好奇，如果事情真发展到书上所写的肉欲程度，她又会作何感想呢。"
"Surely she had not experienced one-tenth of the thoughts or sensations that would have been assigned to her in any advanced piece of literature!","诚然，她体会到的感受还不及任何优秀的文学作品里描绘的十分之一！"
"It had been disillusioning, or else she was deficient, and Fleur, could not bear to feel deficient.","这就是幻想破灭，要不然，就是她还不完美，可弗勒无法容忍自己有任何欠缺。"
"And, lightly powdering her shoulders, she bent her thoughts towards Alison’s monthly.","然后，她轻轻在肩膀扑了些粉，便把思想集中到艾莉森的每月例会上了。"
"Though Lady Alison enjoyed an occasional encounter with the younger generation, the Aubrey Greenes and Linda Frewes of this life were not conspicuous by their presence at her gatherings.","尽管艾莉森夫人偶尔也喜欢和年轻人见见面，可像奥布里·格林和琳达·弗鲁这类人，却很少出现在她的聚会上。"
"Nesta Gorse, indeed, had once attended, but one legal and two literary politicos who had been in contact with her, had complained of it afterwards.","内丝塔·戈斯确实参加过一次，但是一个法律政客和两个文学政客同她接触后，都表示不满。"
"She had, it seemed, rent little spiked holes in the garments of their self-esteem.","她似乎伤了他们的自尊心。"
"Sibley Swan would have been welcome, for his championship of the past, but he seemed, so far, to have turned up his nose and looked down it.","大家倒是十分欢迎昔日的文坛巨匠西布莉·斯旺出席例会，可是，斯旺对此类聚会不屑一顾，不愿现身。"
"So it was not the intelligentsia, but just intellectual society, which was gathered there when Fleur and Michael entered, and the conversation had all the sparkle and all the ‘savoir faire’ incidental to talk about art and letters by those who—as Michael put it—“fortunately had not to faire”","当迈克尔和弗勒进去时，他们发现那里并不是知识分子的聚会，而是有知识的社交人物的聚会。这些人偶尔谈及文艺，却也显出些机敏和才华，只是正如迈克尔所说，他们幸亏是些“不干事的人”。"
"“All the same, these are the guys,” he muttered in Fleur’s ear, “who make the names of artists and writers.","“这些人全是捧场的。”他在弗勒耳边轻声低语，“就是他们这些人把艺术家和作家给捧起来的。"
"What’s the stunt, to-night?”","今晚的特别节目是什么？”"
"It appeared to be the London debut of a lady who sang Balkan folk songs.","原来有一位初登伦敦社交界的女士来唱巴尔干民歌。"
"But in a refuge to the right were four tables set out for bridge.","但是，右边的角落里摆着四张桥牌桌。"
"They were already filled.","桌边坐满了人。"
"Among those who still stood listening, were, here and there, a Gurdon Minho, a society painter and his wife, a sculptor looking for a job.","还有些人分散站在各处，继续听歌。这其中包括格登·明霍、一位社交界的画家和他的妻子，还有一位正在找工作的雕刻家。"
"Fleur, wedged between Lady Feynte, the painter’s wife, and Gurdon Minho himself, began planning an evasion.","弗勒正挤在那位画家的妻子芬特夫人和格登·明霍之间，设法脱身。"
"There—yes, there was Mr. Chalfont!","查尔方特先生也来了——就是他没错！"
"At Lady Alison’s, Fleur, an excellent judge of ‘milieu’ never wasted her time on artists and writers—she could meet THEM anywhere.","在艾莉森夫人的每月例会上，弗勒对社交环境极具判断力，她从来不在那些艺术家和作家身上浪费时间，因为这些人在随便什么地方都能碰到。"
"Here she intuitively picked out the biggest ‘bug,’ politico-literary, and waited to pin him.","在这里，她凭借直觉挑选出最重要的政界和文学界的名流，然后伺机盯住他们。"
"Absorbed in the idea of pinning Mr. Chalfont, she overlooked a piece of drama passing without.","她一心想盯住查尔方特先生，却忽视了外面发生的一出闹剧。"
"Michael had clung to the top of the stairway, in no mood for talk and skirmish; and, leaning against the balustrade, wasp-thin in his long white waistcoat, with hands deep thrust into his trousers’ pockets, he watched the turns and twists of Fleur’s white neck, and listened to the Balkan songs, with a sort of blankness in his brain.","迈克尔一直站在上面的楼梯口处，没有什么心情和旁人交谈或者争论，只是靠着栏杆站着，那件白色长马甲让他看上去瘦骨嶙峋。他双手深深地插在裤兜里，望着弗勒那雪白的脖子扭来扭去，听着巴尔干民歌，脑子里却一片空白。"
"The word: “Mont!” startled him.","一声“蒙特！”惊醒了他。"
"Wilfrid was standing just below.","威尔弗里德就站在他下面。"
"Mont?","蒙特？"
"He had not been that to Wilfrid for two years!","他有两年没听到威尔弗里德这样叫他了！"
"“Come down here.”","“下来。”"
"On that half-landing was a bust of Lionel Charwell, K.C., by Boris Strumolowski, in the genre he had cynically adopted when June Forsyte gave up supporting his authentic but unrewarded genius.","在楼梯中间的平台上，摆有一尊前王室法律顾问莱昂内尔·查韦尔的半身雕塑，这是鲍里斯·斯特拉莫洛斯基的作品。当琼·福赛特不再支持他创作那种反映现实却无利可图的作品后，他就玩世不恭地进入了这一艺术流派。"
"It had been almost indistinguishable from any of the other busts in that year’s Academy, and was used by the young Charwells to chalk moustaches on.","这尊塑像几乎同当年在皇家艺术学院里展出的其他作品没什么区别，现在却成了查韦尔家孩子们的玩具了，他们在上面乱画胡须。"
"Beside this object Desert leaned against the wall with his eyes closed.","德赛特站在这尊雕像旁，靠墙倚着，眼睛闭着。"
"His face was a study to Michael.","他的表情让迈克尔捉摸不透。"
"“What’s wrong, Wilfrid?”","“什么事，威尔弗里德？”"
"Desert did not move.","德赛特一动不动。"
"“You’ve got to know—I’m in love with Fleur.”","“我必须告诉你——我爱上弗勒了。”"
"“What!”","“你说什么？”"
"“I’m not going to play the snake.","“我不想偷偷摸摸。"
"You’re up against me.","我是你的情敌。"
"Sorry, but there it is!","很抱歉，可情况就是这样！"
"You can let fly!”","你尽管骂我吧！”"
"His face was death-pale, and its muscles twitched.","他脸色惨白，面部肌肉抽搐着。"
"In Michael, it was the mind, the heart that twitched.","听到这些话，迈克尔头脑混乱，心乱如麻。"
"What a very horrible, strange, “too beastly” moment!","这一刻太可怕、太诡异、“太让人恶心”了！"
"His best friend—his best man!","这就是他的最好朋友——他的伴郎！"
"Instinctively he dived for his cigarette case—instinctively handed it to Desert.","他下意识地掏出烟盒，又下意识地递给德赛特。"
"Instinctively they both took cigarettes, and lighted each other’s.","两人都不由自主地取出香烟，互相点着了。"
"Then Michael said:","然后，迈克尔说："
"“Fleur—knows?”","“弗勒——知道吗？”"
"Desert nodded: “She doesn’t know I’m telling you—wouldn’t have let me.","德赛特点点头，说道：“她不知道我会和你讲——她肯定不让我告诉你。"
"You’ve nothing against her—yet.”","她没有对不起你的地方——到目前为止。”"
"And, still with closed eyes, he added: “I couldn’t help it.”","然后，他继续闭着眼睛，又加了一句，“我可忍不住了。”"
"It was Michael’s own subconscious thought!","这正符合迈克尔的猜测！"
"Natural!","自然！"
"Natural!","太自然了！"
"Fool not to see how natural!","傻瓜才看不出来这有多自然呢！"
"Then something shut-to within him, and he said: “Decent of you to tell me; but—aren’t you going to clear out?”","接着，他内心一阵疼痛，说：“你告诉我，还算个正人君子，但——你不觉得你现在应该马上离开吗？”"
"Desert’s shoulders writhed against the wall.","德赛特倚着墙，肩膀微动了一下。"
"“I thought so; but it seems not.”","“我之前也这样想，可现在我好像不想这样了。”"
"“Seems?","“好像是什么意思？"
"I don’t understand.”","我听糊涂了。”"
"“If I knew for certain I’d no chance—but I don’t,” and he suddenly looked at Michael: “Look here, it’s no good keeping gloves on.","“如果我知道我没有一点儿机会的话，我当然会离开——可我知道情况并非如此。”这时，他突然看着迈克尔，说道，“你看，咱们都别再伪装了。"
"I’m desperate, and I’ll take her from you if I can.”","我豁出去了，如果可行的话，我会从你身边抢走她。”"
"“Good God!” said Michael.","“上帝啊！”迈克尔说，"
"“It’s the limit!”","“太过分了！”"
"“Yes!","“好！"
"Rub it in!","你尽管嘀咕吧！"
"But, I tell you, when I think of you going home with her, and of myself,” he gave a dreadful little laugh, “I advise you NOT to rub it in.”","但是，我告诉你，当想到你和她一起回家，而我却孤独一人，”他发出一声可怕的笑声，“奉劝你还是别嘀咕的好。”"
"“Well,” said Michael, “as this isn’t a Dostoievsky novel, I suppose there’s no more to be said.”","“嗯，”迈克尔说道，“既然这不是陀思妥耶夫斯基的小说，我也没什么好说的了。”"
"Desert moved from the wall and laid his hand on the bust of Lionel Charwell.","德赛特离开墙壁，把手放在那尊莱昂内尔·查韦尔的半身塑像上。"
"“You realise, at least, that I’ve gone out of my way—perhaps dished myself—by telling you.","“至少，你应该知道我把事情告诉你，我已经无路可走了——也可能完全把路堵死了。"
"I’ve not bombed without declaring war.”","我向来不干不宣而战的事。”"
"“No,” said Michael dully.","“可不是。”迈克尔呆呆地说。"
"“You can chuck my books over to some other publisher.”","“你可以把我的书转给别的出版商。”"
"Michael shrugged.","迈克尔只是耸了耸肩。"
"“Good-night, then,” said Desert.","“那么，晚安。”德赛特说，"
"“Sorry for being so primitive.”","“很抱歉，失礼了。”"
"Michael looked straight into his ‘best man’s’ face.","迈克尔的目光直视着他的“伴郎”。"
"There was no mistaking its expression of bitter despair.","他的表情的确痛苦而绝望。"
"He made a half-movement with his hand, uttered half the word “Wilfrid,” and, as Desert went down, he went upstairs.","他做了半个手势，“威尔弗里德，”这几个字只说了一半，然后，德赛特下楼了，他就上楼了。"
"Back in his place against the balustrade, he tried to realise that life was a laughing matter, and couldn’t.","迈克尔继续回到原来的位子，倚在栏杆旁，努力让自己相信人生不过是场玩笑，可他做不到。"
"His position required a serpent’s cunning, a lion’s courage, a dove’s gentleness: he was not conscious of possessing such proverbial qualities.","他目前的处境需要像蛇一样狡猾、狮子一样的勇猛、鸽子一样的温柔，可是他知道自己并不具备这么高的品质。"
"If Fleur had loved him as he loved her, he would have had for Wilfrid a real compassion.","如果弗勒也能像他爱她那样深爱着他，他的确会同情威尔弗里德。"
"It was so natural to fall in love with Fleur!","爱上弗勒是再自然不过的事情！"
"But she didn’t—oh! no, she didn’t!","但是她不爱他——哦！不爱，她不爱他！"
"Michael had one virtue—if virtue it be—a moderate opinion of himself, a disposition to think highly of his friends.","迈克尔有个优点——如果这个算是优点的话——他对自己评价很谦虚，对朋友评价很高。"
"He had thought highly of Desert; and—odd!—he still did not think lowly of him.","他曾经对德赛特评价很高，而且——说来也怪！——一直到现在，他对德赛特的看法也还没有改变。"
"Here was his friend trying to do him mortal injury, to alienate the affection—more honestly, the toleration—of his wife; and yet he did not think him a cad.","他的这个朋友企图给他致命的一击，挑拨他们夫妻的感情——说得更明白点——煽动他妻子出轨，可他并不认为他是个无赖。"
"Such leniency, he knew, was hopeless; but the doctrines of free-will, and free contract, were not to him mere literary conceptions, they were part of his nature.","他知道这种宽宏大量是无济于事的。但是，对他而言，意志自由和婚姻自由的原则不只是文学上的概念，也是他天性的一部分。"
"To apply duress, however desirable, would not be on his cards.","无论强硬的办法多有用，都不符合他的原则。"
"And something like despair ravaged the heart of him, watching Fleur’s ingratiating little tricks with the great Gerald Chalfont.","当看着弗勒正对那个了不起的杰拉尔德·查尔方特施展一些小花招时，迈克尔的心被一种类似于绝望的情感蹂躏着。"
"If she left him for Wilfrid!","万一她离开他，去找威尔弗里德呢！"
"But surely—no—her father, her house, her dog, her friends, her—her collection of—of—she would not—could not give THEM up?","但是，肯定——不会——她的父亲、她的房子、她的狗、她的朋友，她——她的收藏——她不会——她无法放弃这些吧？"
"But suppose she kept everything, Wilfrid included!","可是她如果既要这些，也要威尔弗里德呢！"
"No, no!","不，不！"
"She wouldn’t!","她不会这样的！"
"Only for a second did that possibility blur the natural loyalty of his mind.","在他天性忠诚的头脑里，这种揣测只是一闪而过。"
"Well, what to do?","那么，怎么办呢？"
"Tell her—talk the thing out?","告诉她——把事情讲清楚？"
"Or wait and watch?","还是静观事态发展？"
"For what?","观望什么呢？"
"Without deliberate spying, he could not watch.","没有周密的监视，他就无从观察。"
"Desert would come to their house no more.","德赛特不会再来他们家了。"
"No!","不行！"
"Either complete frankness; or complete ignoring—and that meant living with the sword of Damocles above his head!","要么开诚布公地讲出来，要么假装什么也没发生——但这就意味着今后头上要悬着一把剑，像达摩克里斯那样生活！"
"No!","不行！"
"Complete frankness!","还是应该开诚布公地讲出来！"
"And not do anything that seemed like laying a trap!","不做背地里捣鬼的事情！"
"He passed his hand across a forehead that was wet.","他用手抹了下湿漉漉的额头。"
"If only they were at home, away from that squalling and these cultivated jackanapes!","他们要是在家里，远离这种嘈杂的世界和这些自命不凡的家伙，该有多好！"
"Could he go in and hook her out?","他能进去把她哄出来吗？"
"Impossible without some reason!","没有正当理由，肯定不行！"
"Only his brain-storm for a reason!","他努力思考，想找出个理由！"
"He must just bite on it.","他必须找个理由。"
"The singing ceased.","歌唱结束了。"
"Fleur was looking round.","弗勒在四处张望。"
"Now she would beckon!","现在，她可能要招呼他了！"
"On the contrary, she came towards him.","相反，弗勒朝他这边走了过来。"
"He could not help the cynical thought: ‘She’s hooked old Chalfont!’","他的脑子里不由得出现了一个恶意的想法：“她一定勾引了老查尔方特！”"
"He loved her, but he knew her little weaknesses.","他爱她，也了解她的小缺点。"
"She came up and took hold of his sleeve.","她走到他面前，拽住他的袖子。"
"“I’ve had enough, Michael, let’s slip off; d’you mind?”","“我玩够了，迈克尔，咱们撤吧，行吗？”"
"“Quick!” he said, “before they spot us!”","“赶快！”他说，“别让他们发现我们！”"
"In the cold air outside he thought: ‘Now?","走在寒冷的室外，他在想：“现在说吗？"
"Or in her room?’","还是回家再说？”"
"“I think,” said Fleur, “that Mr. Chalfont is overrated—he’s nothing but a mental yawn.","“我认为，”弗勒说，“人们对查尔方特先生的评价太高了——他只不过是个酸腐的文人。"
"He’s coming to lunch tomorrow week.”","他下周的明天会来吃午饭。”"
"Not now—in her room!","现在不说——回家再说！"
"“Whom do you think to meet him, besides Alison?”","“除了艾莉森，你还想请谁与他共进午餐呢？”"
"“Nothing jazzy.”","“爵士派的一个也不请。”"
"“Of course not; but it must be somebody intriguing, Michael.","“当然不请，但也必须请些有魅力的人，迈克尔。"
"Bother! sometimes I think it isn’t worth it.”","真讨厌！有时我觉得这么做真没劲。”"
"Michael’s heart stood still.","迈克尔的心差点儿就不跳了。"
"Was that a portent—sign of ‘the primitive’ rising within his adored practitioner of social arts?","这该不会是凶兆吧？难道他所崇拜的这位社会艺术实践家的心里萌生了原始情感了？"
"An hour ago he would have said:","如果是一小时以前，他会这么说："
"“You’re right, my child; it jolly well isn’t!”","“宝贝，你说得对，这么做确实没什么乐趣而言！”"
"But now—any sign of change was ominous!","可现在——任何变化都不是好兆头！"
"He slipped his arm in hers.","他挽住她的手臂。"
"“Don’t worry, we’ll snare the just-right cuckoos, somehow.”","“别担心，不管怎样，我们总会找到合适的人来。”"
"“A Chinese Minister would be perfect,” mused Fleur, “with Minho and Bart—four men—two women—cosy.","“要是有位中国公使就太好了。”弗勒沉思着，“加上明霍和准爵爷——四位男士，两位女士——刚刚好。"
"I’ll talk to Bart.”","我去和准爵爷说。”"
"Michael had opened their front door.","迈克尔打开他们家的前门。"
"She passed him; he lingered to see the stars, the plane trees, a man’s figure motionless, collared to the eyes, hatted down to them.","弗勒从他身边进去。他在外面徘徊了一会儿，望着天空中的点点繁星和一排排法国梧桐树。这时，他看到树边站着一个一动不动的人影，那人衣领遮到眼睛下面，用帽子盖住了眼睛。"
"‘Wilfrid!’ he thought: ‘Spain!","“威尔弗里德!”他想，“西班牙式的！"
"Why Spain?","为何是西班牙式的？"
"And all poor devils who are in distress—the heart—oh! darn the heart!’","所有挣扎着的可怜人——爱情——该死的爱情！”"
"He closed the door.","他关上了门。"
"But soon he had another to open, and never with less enthusiasm.","可是，随后他要打开另一扇窗，再没有比这更提不起劲的事了。"
"Fleur was sitting on the arm of a chair, in the dim lavender pyjamas she sometimes wore just to keep in with things, staring at the fire.","弗勒坐在椅子扶手上，凝望着壁炉。她身穿那件淡紫色的睡衣，有时她只是为了配合屋内的色调才穿这件睡衣。"
"Michael stood, looking at her and at his own reflection beyond in one of the five mirrors—white and black, the pierrot pyjamas she had bought him.","迈克尔站在那里，看看她，再看看其中一面墙镜中的自己——穿着她给买的那件黑白相间、丑角似的睡衣。"
"‘Figures in a play,’ he thought, ‘figures in a play!","“戏剧中的人物，”他想道，“戏剧中的人物！"
"Is it real?’","这一切是真的吗？”"
"He moved forward and sat on the chair’s other arm.","他走过去，坐在椅子另一边的扶手上。"
"“Hang it!” he muttered.","“该死！”他喃喃自语道，"
"“Wish I were Antinous!”","“我要是安提诺乌斯就好了！”"
"And he slipped from the arm into the chair, to be behind her face, if she wanted to hide it from him.","于是，他从扶手滑进椅子里，坐在她身后，万一她不想让自己看到她的脸呢。"
"“Wilfrid’s been telling me,” he said, quietly.","“威尔弗里德已经告诉我了。”他平静地说。"
"Off his chest!","总算把憋在心里的话说出来了！"
"What now?","现在是什么状况？"
"He saw the blood come flushing into her neck and cheek.","他看到弗勒的脖子和脸涨得通红。"
"“Oh!","“哦！"
"What business—how do you mean ‘telling you’?”","什么事——‘他告诉你’是什么意思？”"
"“Just that he’s in love with you—nothing more—there’s nothing more to tell, is there?”","“就是说他爱上你了——没说别的——没别的事可说了，是吗？”"
"And drawing his feet up on to the chair, he clasped his hands hard round his knees.","说着，他把脚缩到椅子里，用双手抱着膝盖。"
"Already—already he had asked a question!","他已经——已经问了一个问题了！"
"Bite on it!","稳住！"
"Bite on it!","稳住！"
"And he shut his eyes.","然后他闭上了眼睛。"
"“Of course,” said Fleur, very slowly, “there’s nothing more.","“当然。”弗勒慢条斯理地说，“当然没别的事了。"
"If Wilfrid chooses to be so silly.”","如果威尔弗里德愿意这样犯傻的话。”"
"Chooses!","愿意！"
"The word seemed unjust to one whose own ‘silliness’ was so recent—so enduring!","这个词听着这么接近“愚蠢”，似乎对一个如此执著于你的人很不公平！"
"And—curious! his heart wouldn’t bound.","而且——奇怪的是，他的心情并没因此而好起来。"
"Surely it ought to have bounded at her words!","听到这话，他本应该高兴起来的！"
"“Is that the end of Wilfrid, then?”","“那么，这就是威尔弗里德的结局了吗？”"
"“The end?","“结局?"
"I don’t know.”","我不清楚。”"
"Ah!","啊！"
"Who knew anything—when passion was about?","当激情奔放之时，谁知道会发生什么呢？"
"“Well,” he said, holding himself hard together, “don’t forget I love you awfully!”","“嗯。”他一边紧紧抱住自己，一边说，“别忘了我非常爱你！”"
"He saw her eyelids flicker, her shoulders shrugging.","他看到她眼睛眨了一下，肩膀耸了耸。"
"“Am I likely to?”","“我像是会忘记吗？”"
"Bitter, cordial, simple—which?","痛苦、热忱、简单——究竟是哪一种？"
"Suddenly her hands came round and took him by the ears.","突然间，她把双手伸过来，抓住他的耳朵。"
"Holding them fast she looked down at him, and laughed.","她一边紧紧捏住他的耳朵，一边低头向下看着他，哈哈一笑。"
"And again his heart WOULD not bound.","可是，他的心还是没有高兴起来。"
"If she did not lead him by the nose, she—!","如果她不是牵着他的鼻子走，她——！"
"But he clutched her to him in the chair.","但他还是一把把她搂进椅子里。"
"Lavender and white and black confused—she returned his kiss.","淡紫色和黑白相间的颜色混在一起——她回应着他的吻。"
"But from the heart?","可这是不是发自内心的？"
"Who knew?","谁知道？"
"Not Michael.","反正迈克尔不知道。"

"Chapter X","第十章"
"Passing of a Sportsman","一个运动家过世了"
"Soames, disappointed of his daughter, said: “I’ll wait,” and took his seat in the centre of the jade green settee, oblivious of Ting-a-ling before the fire, sleeping off the attentions of Amabel Nazing, who had found him ‘just too cunning.’","见女儿不在家，索姆斯有些失落，他说道：“我等等吧。”随后，他坐在那张翠绿色长椅的中间，全然没有注意到火炉前的小叮铃。此时，它正在打盹，将阿玛贝尔·内津的那句“太机灵”的恭维给忘到脑后去了。"
"Grey and composed, with one knee over the other, and a line between his eyes, he thought of Elderson and the condition of the world, and of how there was always something.","索姆斯头发灰白，神情自若。他跷起二郎腿，双目间蹙起一道皱纹。他心里想着埃尔德森、世界局势以及为何总有事情发生。"
"And the more he thought, the more he wondered why he had ever been such a flat as to go on to a Board which had anything to do with foreign contracts.","他越想就越觉得奇怪，自己怎么会傻到加入一个与外国有合同往来的董事会。"
"All the old wisdom that in the nineteenth century had consolidated British wealth, all the Forsyte philosophy of attending to one’s own business, and taking no risks, the close-fibred national individualism which refused to commit the country to chasing this wild goose or that, held within him silent demonstration.","所有为巩固英国财富做出贡献的19世纪的古老智慧、一切摒弃冒险主义、专注个人事业的福赛特哲学以及反对国家采取任何徒劳无益之举的民族利己主义精神，都在他心里静静翻腾着。"
"Britain was on the wrong tack politically to try and influence the Continent, and the P.P.R.S. on the wrong tack monetarily to insure business outside Britain.","就政治而言，英国企图影响欧洲大陆，这是犯了方针性错误；同样，就经济而言，天佑再保险公司扩展海外业务，也是犯了方针性错误。"
"The special instinct of his breed yearned for resumption of the straight and private path.","福赛特家的人都渴望延续有条不紊的个人发展道路。"
"Never meddle with what you couldn’t control!","千万别干自己无法控制的事情！"
"‘Old Mont’ had said: “Keep the ring!”","“老蒙特”曾说过：“保持中立！”"
"Nothing of the sort: Mind one’s own business!","根本没那么回事：管好自己的事！"
"That was the real ‘formula.’","这才是真正的“法则”。"
"He became conscious of his calf—Ting-a-ling was sniffing at his trousers.","他突然觉得小腿那里有什么东西在动——小叮铃正在闻他的裤子。"
"“Oh!” said Soames.","“哦！”索姆斯说，"
"“It’s you!”","“是你啊！”"
"Placing his forepaws against the settee, Ting-a-ling licked the air.","小叮铃吐着舌头，前爪搭在椅背上。"
"“Pick you up?” said Soames.","“要抱你起来吗？”索尔斯说，"
"“You’re too long.”","“你太大了。”"
"And again he felt that faint warmth of being liked.","他顿时有种被喜欢的感觉，丝丝暖意涌上了他的心头。"
"‘There’s something about me that appeals to him,’ he thought, taking him by the scruff and lifting him on to a cushion.","“我身上一定有什么吸引它的地方。”他一边想，一边抓着他的后颈，把它拎到坐垫上。"
"“You and I,” the little dog seemed saying with his stare—Chinese little object!","这小东西盯着他，似乎在说：“只有你和我。”——这条可爱的中国狗！"
"‘I shall resign,’ thought Soames.","“我应该辞职。”索姆斯想。"
"But what about Winifred, and Imogen, and some of the Rogers and Nicholases who had been putting money into this thing because he was a director?","可是，威妮弗雷德、伊莫金以及罗杰家族和尼古拉斯家族中的一些人怎么办？因为他当董事，这些人才把资金投进来的。"
"He wished they wouldn’t follow him like a lot of sheep!","他希望他们可别像一群羊似的跟在他后面。"
"He rose from the settee.","他从长椅上站起来。"
"It was no good waiting, he would walk on to Green Street and talk to Winifred at once.","没什么好等的了，他得马上去格林街找威妮弗雷德谈谈。"
"She would have to sell again, though the shares had dropped a bit.","尽管股票已经跌了一点儿，她必须再次抛出。"
"And without taking leave of Ting-a-ling, he went out.","然后，没与小叮铃告别，他就出去了。"
"All this last year he had almost enjoyed life.","去年整整一年，他都在享受人生。"
"Having somewhere to come and sit and receive a certain sympathy once at least a week, as in old days at Timothy’s, was of incalculable advantage to his spirit.","他会去某个地方走走、坐坐，总能收获某种安慰，至少一周一次。就像从前在蒂莫西家一样，这对他保持良好的精神状态大有益处。"
"In going from home Fleur had taken most of his heart with her; but Soames had found it almost an advantage to visit his heart once a week rather than to have it always about.","弗勒的出嫁，让他感觉心里空落落的。可是索姆斯发现，每周看一次心肝宝贝，要比她总在自己身边更好些。"
"There were other reasons conducing to light-heartedness.","还有一些其他事情也让他感觉很轻松。"
"That diabolical foreign chap, Prosper Profond, had long been gone he didn’t know where, and his wife had been decidedly less restive and sarcastic ever since.","那个可恶的外国佬——普罗斯珀·普罗芳——早就不知跑到什么地方去了。自那以后，他的妻子明显比以前安分多了，也很少嘲笑别人了。"
"She had taken up a thing they called Coue, and grown stouter.","她迷上了一种叫做“库埃”的东西，身体变得结实起来。"
"She used the car a great deal.","她经常开车。"
"Altogether she was more domestic.","总之，她比以前更爱呆在家里了。"
"Then, too, he had become reconciled to Gauguin—a little slump in that painter had convinced him that he was still worth attention, and he had bought three more.","之后，他和画家高更和解了。高更的画作市价稍有下跌，但索姆斯认为他的作品依然值得关注，所以他又买了3幅。"
"Gauguin would rise again!","高更的画会再次升值！"
"Soames almost regretted his intuition of that second coming, for he had quite taken to the chap.","索姆斯对自己追逐涨价的念头感到遗憾，自己欣赏他就可以了。"
"His colour, once you got used to it, was very attractive.","他画中的色彩，你一旦看习惯了，就非常具有吸引力。"
"One picture, especially, which meant nothing so far as he could see, had a way of making you keep your eyes on it.","特别是有一幅画，高更自己认为没什么，但却有一种让人流连其中的感觉。"
"He even felt uneasy when he thought of having to part with the thing at an enhanced price.","当索姆斯想到价格一涨他就得转手时，心里挺不是滋味的。"
"But, most of all, he had been feeling so well, enjoying a recrudescence of youth in regard to Annette, taking more pleasure in what he ate, while his mind dwelt almost complacently on the state of money.","但最重要的是，索姆斯一直感觉很好，安妮特给他带来了重返青春般的乐趣，食物也给他带来了极大的快乐，他全心享受着金钱带来的满足感。"
"The pound going up in value; Labour quiet!","英镑升值了；工党很安静！"
"And now they had got rid of that Jack-o’-lantern, they might look for some years of solid Conservative administration.","现在劳合·乔治下台了，保守党即将稳稳地掌几年权了。"
"And to think, as he did, stepping across St. James’ Park towards Green Street, that he had gone and put his foot into a concern which he could not control, made him feel—well, as if the devil had been in it!","他一边穿过圣詹姆斯公园，朝格林街的方向走去，一边在想，他怎么会涉足一个自己无法掌控的公司——唉，真是见鬼了！"
"In Piccadilly he moused along on the Park side, taking his customary look up at the ‘Iseeum’ Club.","在皮卡迪利大街，他沿着公园一边蹑手蹑脚地向前走，习惯性地瞧一眼“伊昔姆”俱乐部。"
"The curtains were drawn, and chinks of light glowed, long and cosy.","俱乐部拉着窗帘，帘缝间透出狭长而舒缓的灯光。"
"And that reminded him—some one had said George Forsyte was ill.","这时，他想起——有人说乔治·福赛特病了。"
"Certainly he had not seen him in the bay window for months past.","是啊，他有几个月没见到他坐在这里的飘窗边了。"
"Well, George had always eaten and drunk too much.","唉，乔治总是能吃能喝。"
"He crossed over and passed beneath the Club; and a sudden feeling—he didn’t know what—a longing for his own past, a sort of nostalgia—made him stop and mount the steps.","他穿过马路，朝俱乐部下面走去。他突然很怀念过去，自己也莫名其妙，像是患上思乡病了——他不由地停住脚步，登上俱乐部的台阶。"
"“Mr. George Forsyte in the Club?”","“乔治·福赛特在俱乐部里吗？”"
"The janitor stared, a grey-haired, long-faced chap, whom he had known from away back in the ‘eighties.","头发灰白的长脸门卫瞪着他看。索姆斯早在上世纪80年代就见过他了。"
"“Mr. Forsyte, sir,” he said, “is very ill indeed.","他说：“先生，福赛特先生的确病得很重。"
"They say he won’t recover, sir.”","他们都说他的病不会好了。”"
"“What?” said Soames.","“什么？”索姆斯说，"
"“Nobody told me that.”","“没人和我提过啊。”"

"On those walls, wherever the eye roved, were prints coloured and uncoloured, old and new, depicting the sports of racing and prize-fighting!","放眼望去，四面墙壁上既有色彩画也有黑白画，既有旧画也有新作。画的是赛马运动和职业拳击运动。"

"“My three screws to young Val Dartie, because he’s the only Forsyte that knows a horse from a donkey.”","“我那3匹老马给小瓦尔·达尔蒂，因为他是福赛特家族里唯一懂得区分马和驴的人。”"
"A throaty chuckle sounded ghastly in the ears of Soames.","他发出一阵沙哑而低沉的笑声，在索姆斯听来很是瘆人。"
"“What have you said?”","“你是怎么写的？”"
"Soames read: “I hereby leave my three racehorses to my kinsman, Valerius Dartie, of Wansdon, Sussex, because he has special knowledge of horses.”","索姆斯读道：“兹将我3匹赛马赠予我的亲戚瓦勒列斯·达尔蒂，萨塞克斯郡沃斯顿人，因他深谙识马之术。”"

"Venture","冒险"
"For a week Bicket had seen ‘the job,’ slippery as an eel, evasive as a swallow, for ever passing out of reach.","一周来，比克特眼睁睁地瞅着“他要找的工作”像鳗鱼一样从他面前溜走，又像燕子一样从他面前翩翩飞过，永远可望而不可即。"
"A pound for keep, and three shillings invested on a horse, and he was down to twenty-four bob.","在这7天时间里，他花了一英镑维持生计，3个先令赌马，就剩下24先令了。"
"The weather had turned sou’-westerly and Victorine had gone out for the first time.","外面刮的已经是西南风了，并且维多琳也已经出了一次门了。"
"That was something off his mind, but the cramp of the unemployed sensation, that fearful craving for the means of mere existence, a protesting, agonising anxiety, was biting into the very flesh of his spirit.","这两件事使他放心了些，但是失业的感觉紧紧地束缚着他，单纯只是想活下去的渴望强烈得令人害怕，还有一种由于发自内心的抗争而产生的焦虑正折磨着他，啃噬着他的脑细胞。"
"If he didn’t get a job within a week or two, there would be nothing for it but the workhouse, or the gas.","如果一周或是两周之内他还找不到工作，那就只能去济贫院或是开煤气自杀了。"
"‘The gas,’ thought Bicket, ‘if she will, I will.","“煤气，”比克特想道，“要是她愿意的话，我也没问题。"
"I’m fed up.","我已经受够了。"
"After all, what is it?","毕竟，也没什么大不了的。"
"In her arms I wouldn’t mind.’","要是能死在她的怀里，我死而无憾。”"
"Instinct, however, that it was not so easy as all that to put one’s head under the gas, gave him a brainwave that Monday night.","然而，他本能地觉得把脑袋放在煤气灶下不是那么容易，于是在周一的晚上他脑中闪过一丝灵光。"
"Balloons—that chap in Oxford Street today!","气球——今天在牛津街看到的那个卖气球的家伙！"
"Why not?","为什么不呢？"
"He still had the capital for a flutter in them, and no hawker’s licence needed.","小赌一把的资本他还是有的，而且卖气球也不需要申请小贩许可证。"
"His brain, working like a squirrel in the small hours, grasped the great, the incalculable advantage of coloured balloons over all other forms of commerce.","后半夜，他的大脑像松鼠一样活跃，想的全都是卖彩色气球能获得的极大的、无法估量的好处，这些好处是其他生意比不了的。"
"You couldn’t miss the man who sold them—there he was for every eye to see, with his many radiant circumferences dangling in front of him!","你肯定不会错过那卖气球的人的——他就在那里，谁都能看得到，面前飘荡着许多颜色亮丽的气球！"
"Not much profit in them, he had gathered—a penny on a sixpenny globe of coloured air, a penny on every three small twopenny globes; still their salesman was alive, and probably had pitched him a poor tale for fear of making his profession seem too attractive.","利润不会太高，他已经算过了——一个六便士的彩色气球可以赚一个便士，三个两便士的小气球也能赚一个便士。可是卖气球的人还活着，也许他还会给别人讲述他的悲惨故事，以免让人眼红他的生意。"
"Over the Bridge, just where the traffic—no, up by St. Paul’s!","是站在桥上，还是在交通要道上——不，还是上圣保罗教堂去！"
"He knew a passage where he could stand back a yard or two, like that chap in Oxford Street!","他知道那里有一条小路，可以让他退后一两码，就像那个站在牛津街的家伙那样！"
"But to the girl sleeping beside him he said nothing.","但是，对睡在他身边的妻子，他什么也没说。"
"No word to her till he had thrown the die.","等事情有眉目了再告诉她。"
"It meant gambling with his last penny.","这意味着拿最后一点儿小钱去赌一把。"
"For a bare living he would have to sell—why, three dozen big and four dozen small balloons a day would only be twenty-six shillings a week profit, unless that chap was kidding.","为了能够活下去，他每天得卖掉——3打大气球和4打小气球，一周也就赚26先令，除非那个卖气球的家伙骗他。"
"Not much towards ‘Austrylia’ out of that!","靠这些钱是去不了“澳大利亚”的！"
"And not a career—Victorine would have a shock!","再说，这也算不上是一种职业——维多琳会大吃一惊的！"
"But it was neck or nothing now—he must try it, and in off hours go on looking for a job.","但是现在成败在此一举——他必须试试，然后利用空余时间继续找工作。"
"Our thin capitalist, then, with four dozen big and seven dozen small on a tray, two shillings in his pocket, and little in his stomach, took his stand off St. Paul’s at two o’clock next day.","于是，在第二天下午2点的时候，我们这位体格单薄的资本家，带着一个盛着4打大气球和7打小气球的盘子，站在了圣保罗教堂外面。他的肚子里空空如也，口袋里只剩下两先令。"
"Slowly he blew up and tied the necks of two large and three small, magenta, green and blue, till they dangled before him.","他慢慢地吹起两个大气球和三个小气球，把气球口扎紧了，让这些紫红色、绿色和蓝色的气球在自己面前飘荡。"
"Then with the smell of rubber in his nostrils, and protruding eyes, he stood back on the kerb and watched the stream go by.","然后，他满嘴都是橡胶的味道，两眼突出，靠后站在人行道边石上，瞅着川流不息的过往人群。"
"It gratified him to see that most people turned to look at him.","看到大多数路人都会转身看看自己，他感到很是满意。"
"But the first person to address him was a policeman, with:","但是，第一个和他说话的却是一个警察，他说："
"“I’m not sure you can stand there.”","“我想你不能站在这儿。”"
"Bicket did not answer, his throat felt too dry.","比克特没有回答，他觉得自己的嗓子很干。"
"He had heard of the police.","他听人说过警察。"
"Had he gone the wrong way to work?","难道他选错了做生意的地方？"
"Suddenly he gulped, and said: “Give us a chance, constable; I’m right on my bones.","他猛吸了一大口气，然后说：“给我们一个机会吧，警官。我已经一贫如洗了。"
"If I’m in the way, I’ll stand anywhere you like.","要是我挡着道了，您让我站哪儿都行。"
"This is new to me, and two bob’s all I’ve got left in the world besides a wife.”","我头一次干这个买卖。我在这个世上就剩下一个老婆和两个先令了。”"
"The constable, a big man, looked him up and down.","这位大个子警察上上下下地打量了他一番。"
"“Well, we’ll see.","“好吧。我们看着办吧。"
"I shan’t make trouble for you if no one objects.”","如果没有人反对的话，我也不会找你麻烦的。”"
"Bicket’s gaze deepened thankfully.","比克特满怀感激之情地望着那位警官。"
"“I’m much obliged,” he said; “tyke one for your little girl—to please me.”","“太谢谢您了。”他说，“拿一个给您的小孩玩去吧——让我高兴一下。”"
"“I’ll buy one,” said the policeman, “and give you a start.","“我会买一个的，”那警察说，“就算给你开张了。"
"I go off duty in an hour, you ‘ave it ready—a big one, magenta.”","再过一个小时我就下班了，到时候你给我准备好就行——一个大气球，要紫红色的。”"
"He moved away.","说完，他就走开了。"
"Bicket could see him watching.","比克特能看见他值勤。"
"Edging into the gutter, he stood quite still; his large eyes clung to every face that passed; and, now and then, his thin fingers nervously touched his wares.","比克特静静地站在排水沟的旁边，用那双大眼睛盯着每一位过路人的脸，还时不时紧张地用他那瘦削的手指去碰碰他的货品。"
"If Victorine could see him!","要是维多琳能看见他就好了！"
"All the spirit within him mounted.","他的精神为之一振。"
"By Golly! he would get out of this somehow into the sun, into a life that was a life!","天哪！他得设法摆脱这种生活，到阳光下去，过真正的生活！"
"He had been standing there nearly two hours, shifting from foot to unaccustomed foot, and had sold four big and five small—sixpenny worth of profit—when Soames, who had changed his route to spite those fellows who couldn’t get past William Gouldyng Ingerer, came by on his way to the P.P.R.S. board.","他已经站了将近两个小时了，重心从一只脚换到另一只脚，卖掉了四个大气球和五个小气球——赚了六个便士——这时，索姆斯刚好路过这里。他改走这条道去天佑再保险公司董事会，是为了去教训一下那些连威廉·古尔丁·英格勒家族都不知道的家伙。"
"Startled by a timid murmur: “Balloon, sir, best quality,” he looked round from that contemplation of St. Paul’s which had been his lifelong habit, and stopped in sheer surprise.","他这辈子有个习惯，每逢路过圣保罗教堂，总要看上两眼。这时，一个怯生生的低语吓了他一跳：“气球，先生，最好的气球。”他四下看了看，十分惊奇地停下了脚步。"
"“Balloon!” he said.","“气球！”他说道，"
"“What should I want with a balloon?”","“我要气球干什么？”"
"Bicket smiled.","比克特笑了。"
"Between those green and blue and orange globes and Soames’ grey self-containment there was incongruity which even he could appreciate.","那些绿色、蓝色、橙色的气球和索姆斯那副阴沉的表情实在有点儿不相称，这一点连他都能感觉出来。"
"“Children like ‘em—no weight, sir, waistcoat pocket.”","“孩子们喜欢它们——不占分量，先生，放在您的马甲口袋里就行。”"
"“I daresay,” said Soames, “but I’ve no children.”","“也许吧，”索姆斯说，“可我没有小孩。”"
"“Grandchildren, sir.”","“孙儿孙女也行啊，先生。”"
"“Nor any grandchildren.”","“也没有孙儿孙女。”"
"“Thank you, sir.”","“那谢谢您了，先生。”"
"Soames gave him one of those rapid glances with which he was accustomed to gauge the character of the impecunious.","索姆斯迅速地瞥了他一眼，他惯于以此评定那些穷人的品性。"
"‘A poor, harmless little rat!’ he thought “Here, give me two—how much?”","“一个可怜的、没有恶意的小东西！”他想，“喂，给我两个气球——多少钱？”"
"“A shilling, sir, and much obliged.”","“一个先令，先生，非常感谢。”"
"“You can keep the change,” said Soames hurriedly, and passed on, astonished.","“不用找零了。”索姆斯一边说，一边匆忙地走了过去。他自己也很吃惊。"
"Why on earth he had bought the things, and for more than double their price, he could not conceive.","他不明白自己究竟为什么会买这样的东西，还付了两倍以上的价钱。"
"He did not recollect such a thing having happened to him before.","他记得以前自己从没做过这样的事情。"
"Extremely peculiar!","太奇怪了！"
"And suddenly he realised why.","可是他突然明白自己为什么这样做了。"
"The fellow had been humble, mild—to be encouraged, in these days of Communistic bravura.","那个人谦卑、温驯——在共产主义大行其道的今天，这样的人值得鼓励。"
"After all, the little chap was—was on the side of Capital, had invested in those balloons!","这小家伙毕竟是——站在资本主义这边的，他把钱投资在这些气球上了！"
"Trade!","做买卖了！"
"And, raising his eyes towards St. Paul’s again, he stuffed the nasty-feeling things down into his overcoat pocket.","然后，他再次抬眼向圣保罗大教堂望去，把那邋遢东西塞进外衣口袋里。"
"Somebody would be taking them out, and wondering what was the matter with him!","有人会把这东西拿出来的，还会奇怪他怎么会有这样的东西！"
"Well, he had other things to think of!...","得了，他还有别的事情要考虑呢！……"
"Bicket, however, stared after him, elated.","而比克特则兴高采烈地目送他离开。"
"Two hundred and fifty odd percent. profit on those two—that was something like.","这两只气球获利250%以上——这感觉好极了。"
"The feeling, that not enough women were passing him here, became less poignant—after all, women knew the value of money, no extra shillings out of them!","由于从他这里路过的妇女不多，他一度有些泄气，现在则不那么难过了——毕竟，女人懂得钱的价值，她们是一个先令也不会多给的！"
"If only some more of these shiny-hatted old millionaires would come along!","要是能多来几个像这样帽子锃亮的老百万富翁就好了！"
"At six o’clock, with a profit of three and eightpence, to which Soames had contributed just half, he began to add the sighs of deflating balloons to his own; untying them with passionate care he watched his coloured hopes one by one collapse, and stored them in the drawer of his tray.","到6点钟的时候，比克特一共赚了3先令零8便士，其中有一半是索姆斯贡献的。他开始一边叹气一边给气球放气。他小心翼翼地把这一只只气球解开，看着这些彩色的希望一个个瘪下去，然后把它们收进托盘的抽屉里。"
"Taking it under his arm, he moved his tired legs in the direction of the Bridge.","他把托盘夹在腋下，拖着疲惫的双腿，朝大桥方向走去。"
"In a full day he might make four to five shillings—Well, it would just keep them alive, and something might turn up!","要是干上一整天的话，该能挣四五个先令的——嗯，刚好够他们活下去，也许会时来运转！"
"He was his own master, anyway, accountable neither to employer nor to union.","不管怎样，他现在是自己的主人了，无需再为老板或是工会做什么。"
"That knowledge gave him a curious lightness inside, together with the fact that he had eaten nothing since breakfast.","想到这一点，再加上他早饭过后就什么也没吃，他心里感到一阵莫名的轻松感。"
"‘Wonder if he was an alderman,’ he thought; ‘they say those aldermen live on turtle soup.’","“不知道他是不是个市议员，”他想，“据说那些市议员都是喝甲鱼汤的。”"
"Nearing home, he considered nervously what to do with the tray?","快到家的时候，他为不知如何处理这个托盘而紧张起来。"
"How prevent Victorine from knowing that he had joined the ranks of Capital, and spent his day in the gutter?","怎么才能不让维多琳知道他已经加入了资本家的队伍，还在排水沟旁站了一天呢？"
"Ill luck!","真倒霉！"
"She was at the window!","她就站在窗口！"
"He must put a good face on it.","他必须得装成一副高高兴兴的样子。"
"And he went in whistling.","于是，他吹着口哨走了进去。"
"“What’s that, Tony?” she said, pointing to the tray.","“那是什么，托尼？”她指着那个托盘问道。"
"“Ah! ha!","“啊哈！"
"Great stunt—this!","精彩的表演——看这个！"
"Look ‘ere!”","看这里！”"
"Taking a balloon out from the tray, he blew.","他从托盘里拿出一个气球，吹了起来。"
"He blew with a desperation he had not yet put into the process.","他从来没使过这么大的劲，拼命地吹着。"
"They said the things would swell to five feet in circumference.","据说这东西可以吹到周长五英尺那么大。"
"He felt somehow that if he could get it to attain those proportions, it would soften everything.","不知为什么，他觉得只要能把球吹成那么大，就能让事情缓和下来。"
"Under his breath the thing blotted out Victorine, and the room, till there was just the globe of coloured air.","他吹着吹着，气球已经大到遮住了维多琳，挡住了房间，直到眼前能看到的只有这个彩色的气球。"
"Nipping its neck between thumb and finger, he held it up, and said:","他用拇指和食指捏住气球口，把它举起来，对维多琳说："
"“There you are; not bad value for sixpence, old girl!” and he peered round it.","“你瞧，六个便士不算贵吧，大姑娘！”说着，他从气球一侧探头望去。"
"Lord, she was crying!","天啊，她哭了！"
"He let the ‘blymed’ thing go; it floated down, the air slowly evaporating till a little crinkled wreck rested on the dingy carpet.","他撒手放掉了那个“该死的”东西。它缓缓飘落，里面的空气慢慢漏出来，直到缩成皱巴巴的一团，落在脏兮兮的地毯上。"
"Clasping her heaving shoulders, he said desperately:","他抓住她哭得一耸一耸的肩膀，拼命地说道："
"“Cheerio, my dear, don’t quarrel with bread and butter.","“亲爱的，振作起来，别再为了生计吵架了。"
"I shall get a job, this is just to tide us over.","我会找到工作的，这只是暂时的过渡罢了。"
"I’d do a lot worse than that for you.","为了你，比这更糟糕的事，我也愿意做。"
"Come on, and get my tea, I’m hungry, blowin’ up those things.”","好啦，好啦，把我的茶点拿来吧。一直吹这些东西，我都饿了。”"
"She stopped crying, looked up, said nothing—mysterious with those big eyes!","她不哭了，抬起头来看看，什么也没说——那双大眼睛太神秘了！"
"You’d say she had thoughts!","看得出来，她肯定有心事！"
"But what they were Bicket could not tell.","但是那是什么心事，比克特却说不出来。"
"Under the stimulus of tea, he achieved a certain bravado about his new profession.","在茶点的刺激下，他对自己的新营生有了夸夸其谈的勇气了。"
"To be your own master!","做自己的主人！"
"Go out when you liked, come home when you liked—lie in bed with Vic if he jolly well pleased.","想什么时候出去就什么时候出去，想什么时候回家就什么时候回家——要是特别开心的话，就和维躺在床上不必起来。"
"A lot in that!","好处可多了！"
"And there rose in Bicket something truly national, something free and happy-go-lucky, resenting regular work, enjoying a spurt, and a laze-off, craving independence—something that accounted for the national life, the crowds of little shops, of middlemen, casual workers, tramps, owning their own souls in their own good time, and damning the consequences—something inherent in the land, the race, before the Saxons and their conscience and their industry came in-something that believed in swelling and collapsing coloured air, demanded pickles and high flavours without nourishment—yes, all that something exulted above Bicket’s kipper and his tea, good and strong.","于是，比克特心里涌起了一些真正英国式的想法——想要自由自在、随遇而安；不喜欢规律性的工作，喜欢拼命努力一阵子，然后懒散消闲一阵子；渴望独立自主——这可就是英国人的生活。你看那成群的小商铺、经纪人、临时工和流浪汉，随心所欲地消磨自己美好的时光，管他什么后果——这种想法是这片土地、这个民族所特有的，在撒克逊人来之前，在产生良知和勤勉之前就有了——这种想法就是相信彩色气球会先膨胀后萎缩，就是能吃到那些腌制品和味道很重但毫无营养的东西就够了——比克特享用着可口的腌鱼和浓茶时，这些想法就在他心中欢腾着。"
"He would rather sell balloons than be a packer any day, and don’t let Vic forget it!","他宁可卖气球，也不愿意再做一天的包装工人，可不能让维忘记这一点！"
"And when she was able to take a job, they would get on fine, and not be long before they’d saved enough to get out of it to where those blue butterflies came from.","然后等她也能工作的时候，他们的生活就会好起来。再然后，用不了多久，他们就能攒够钱，摆脱这种生活，到蓝蝴蝶飞来的那个地方去。"
"And he spoke of Soames.","他还谈到了索姆斯。"
"A few more aldermen without children—say two a day, fifteen bob a week outside legitimate trade.","要是再来几个没有子女的市议员——比方说，一天来两个吧，一周就能多挣15先令的外快了。"
"Why, in under a year they’d have the money!","哦，用不了一年的工夫，他们就能弄到那笔钱了！"
"And once away, Vic would blow out like one of those balloons; she’d be twice the size, and a colour in her cheeks to lay over that orange and magenta.","只要离开这里，维就会像那些气球一样丰满起来。她的身体会是现在的两倍那么大，脸蛋也会红润起来，比橙色和紫红的气球还要红。"
"Bicket became full of air.","比克特变得神采飞扬。"
"And the girl, his wife, watched with her large eyes and spoke little; but she did not cry again, or, indeed, throw any water, warm or cold, on him who sold balloons.","而那位姑娘，他的妻子，则睁着大大的眼睛看着他，什么话也没说。但是，她没有再哭。或者说，确实没有再向他——这个卖气球的——泼热水或是泼冷水。"

"Chapter XII","第十二章"
"Figures and Facts","数字与事实"
"With the exception of old Fontenoy—in absence as in presence ornamental—the Board was again full; Soames, conscious of special ingratiation in the manner of ‘that chap’ Elderson, prepared himself for the worst.","除了老福坦诺——他出不出席都是个摆设——董事会成员再次全体莅会。索姆斯注意到埃尔德森“那家伙”的一举一动都是在刻意地讨好别人，于是为自己作了最坏的打算。"
"The figures were before them; a somewhat colourless show, appearing to disclose a state of things which would pass muster, if within the next six months there were no further violent disturbances of currency exchange.","数字就摆在董事们的面前，这种展示有点儿无趣，看起来就像是要说明这么一个状况：如果未来六个月里外汇市场没有发生剧烈震荡的话，那么公司的情况就还不错。"
"The proportion of foreign business to home business was duly expressed in terms of two to seven; German business, which constituted the bulk of the foreign, had been lumped—Soames noted—in the middle section, of countries only half bankrupt, and taken at what might be called a conservative estimate.","公司的国内业务和国外业务的比例是七比二，看起来很合理。索姆斯发现，占据国外业务绝大比例的德国业务被并入到中间部分，即与半破产国家归在一起，而且这“半破产”还是保守的估计。"
"During the silence which reigned while each member of the Board digested the figures, Soames perceived more clearly than ever the quandary he was in.","会场里安静极了。董事会的每个成员都在琢磨着那些数字，而索姆斯却更清楚地觉得自己陷入了两难的境地。"
"Certainly, these figures would hardly justify the foregoing of the dividend earned on the past year’s business.","的确，很难以这些数字为理由要求公司按照去年的业绩发放红利。"
"But suppose there were another Continental crash and they became liable on the great bulk of their foreign business, it might swamp all profits on home business next year, and more besides.","但是，如果欧洲大陆再次发生经济危机，而他们又要对公司绝大部分对外业务承担责任的话，那么下一年度国内业务的盈利很可能会全赔进去，也许还不止如此。"
"And then his uneasiness about Elderson himself—founded he could not tell on what, intuitive, perhaps silly.","此外，埃尔德森这个人也令索姆斯感到不安——至于为什么不安，他也说不清楚。也许是出于直觉，也许有些杞人忧天。"
"“Well, Mr. Forsyte,” the chairman was speaking; “there are the figures.","“嗯，福赛特先生，”董事长说话了，“这就是那些数字。"
"Are you satisfied?”","您觉得满意吗？”"
"Soames looked up; he had taken a resolution.","索姆斯抬起头来，下定了决心："
"“I will agree to this year’s dividend on condition that we drop this foreign business in future, lock, stock and barrel.”","“我同意发放今年的红利，但条件是从此放弃这种对外业务——完全放弃。”"
"The manager’s eyes hard and bright, met his, then turned towards the chairman.","那位经理的眼神冷峻而机警，和索姆斯对视一眼，而后转向了董事长。"
"“That appears to savour of the panicky,” he said; “the foreign business is responsible for a good third of our profit this year.”","“这听起来让人觉得恐慌，”他说道，“国外业务占到今年公司利润的三分之一之多呢。”"
"The chairman seemed to garner the expressions of his fellow-directors, before he said:","董事长貌似环顾了一下各位董事的表情，然后才说："
"“There is nothing in the foreign situation at the moment, Mr. Forsyte, which gives particular cause for alarm.","“福赛特先生，眼下国外业务没有出现可以引起恐慌的状况。"
"I admit that we should watch it closely—”","我承认我们应该密切关注这方面——”"
"“You can’t,” interjected Soames.","“您不能这么做。”索姆斯插话说，"
"“Here we are four years from the Armistice, and we know no more where we stand than we did then.","“停战至今已经四年了，而我们对自己处境的了解并没有增加。"
"If I’d realised our commitment to this policy, I should never have come on the Board.","要是我早意识到我们为这个业务承担的风险，我是绝对不会加入董事会的。"
"We must drop it.”","我们必须放弃这一业务方针。”"
"“Rather an extreme view.","“这是相当极端的看法。"
"And hardly a matter we can decide in a moment.”","而且这件事也不是一时半会儿就能决定的。”"
"The murmur of assent, the expression, faintly ironical, of ‘that chap’s’ lips, jolted the tenacity in Soames.","赞同者小声嘀咕起来，再加上“那家伙”嘴上略带讽刺的表情，让索姆斯的决心动摇了。"
"“Very well!","“很好！"
"Unless you’re prepared to tell the shareholders in the report that we are dropping foreign business, you drop me.","除非你们准备好在报告里告知股东，说我公司将放弃国外业务，否则你们就得放弃我。"
"I must be free to raise the question myself at the general meeting.”","我一定会亲自在全体股东大会上提出这个问题的。我有这个自由。”"
"He did not miss the shift and blink in the manager’s eyes.","他没有错过那位经理躲躲闪闪的眼神。"
"That shot had gone home!","这一下可击中要害了！"
"The Chairman said:","董事长说："
"“You put a pistol to our heads.”","“你这是拿枪指着我们的脑袋啊。”"
"“I am responsible to the shareholders,” said Soames, “and I shall do my duty by them.”","“我这是对股东们负责，”索姆斯说，“我也会依靠他们履行我的职责。”"
"“So we all are, Mr. Forsyte; and I hope we shall all do our duty.”","“我们都是这样的，福赛特先生，而且我希望大家都能尽到自己的职责。”"
"“Why not confine the foreign business to the small countries—their currency is safe enough?”","“为什么不把国外业务限定在那些小国家内呢——他们的货币不是很稳定的吗？”"
"‘Old Mont,’ and his precious ‘ring!’","“老蒙特”和他那宝贝“圈子”！"
"“No,” said Soames, “we must go back to safety.”","“不行，”索姆斯说，“我们必须退到安全线内。”"
"“Splendid isolation, Forsyte?”","“辉煌的孤立吗，福赛特？”"
"“Meddling was all very well in the war, but in peace—politics or business—this half-and-half interference is no good.","“在战争时期，干预是非常管用的，但是在和平年代——不论是政治还是经济——这种一手经济、一手政治的干涉是没有用的。"
"We can’t control the foreign situation.”","我们无法掌控英国以外的形势。”"
"He looked around him, and was instantly conscious that with those words he had struck a chord.","他环顾四周，马上意识到自己的话已经触动大家的心弦了。"
"‘I’m going through with this!’ he thought.","“在这个问题上我要坚持到底！”他想道。"
"“I should be glad, Mr. Chairman”—the manager was speaking—“if I might say a word.","“董事长先生，”——那位经理说道——“请允许我说几句，我将不胜感激。"
"The policy was of my initiation, and I think I may claim that it has been of substantial benefit to the Society so far.","那个方针是我提议的，而且我想我可以断言，到目前为止，这一方针为本公司带来的收益是很可观的。"
"When, however, a member of the Board takes so strong a view against its continuance, I certainly don’t press the Board to continue it.","但是，如果董事会的成员里有人如此强烈地反对继续这一方针，我当然不会强迫董事会继续推行这一方针。"
"The times ARE uncertain, and a risk, of course, is involved, however conservative our estimates.”","由于时局是不确定的，就算我们的估计再怎么保守，风险依然是存在的。”"
"‘Now why?’ thought Soames: ‘What’s he ratting for?’","“他这是怎么了？”索姆斯想，“怎么突然变词了？”"
"“That’s very handsome of you, Elderson; Mr. Chairman, I think we may say that is very handsome of our manager.”","“你真是太大度了，埃尔德森。董事长先生，我觉得我们这位经理可以说是太大度了。”"
"Old Dosey Cosey!","老混蛋！"
"Handsome!","大度！"
"The old woman!","这个老妖婆！"
"The Chairman’s rather harsh voice broke a silence.","董事长那相当刺耳的声音打破了会场的沉默。"
"“This is a very serious point of policy.","“这是一个十分严肃的方针问题。"
"I should have been glad to have Lord Fontenoy present.”","我觉得如果福坦诺勋爵在场的话，就太好了。”"
"“If I am to endorse the report,” said Soames shortly, “it must be decided today.","“如果想要我在这份报告上签名的话，”索姆斯立刻说，“今天就得定下来。"
"I have made up my mind.","我已经拿定主意了。"
"But please yourselves.”","你们想怎么办，随便。”"
"He threw in those last three words from a sort of fellow feeling—it was unpleasant to be dragooned!","他之所以说最后这句话，是念在大家同事一场的情分上——被逼无奈的感觉让人很不愉快！"
"A moment’s silence, and then discussion assumed that random volubility which softens a decision already forced on one.","大家沉默了片刻，然后讨论起来，就好像这种人人畅所欲言的讨论缓和了此前被迫做出决定的气氛。"
"A quarter of an hour thus passed before the Chairman said:","就这么过了一刻钟之后，董事长宣布："
"“We are agreed then, gentlemen, that the report shall contain the announcement that, in view of Continental uncertainty, we are abandoning foreign risks for the present.”","“那么，诸位，我们都同意在这份报告中写入这样一份声明，即鉴于欧洲大陆局势的不确定性，我公司将暂时放弃国外保险业务。”"
"Soames had won.","索姆斯获胜了。"
"Relieved and puzzled, he walked away alone.","他觉得既轻松又困惑，独自离开了。"
"He had shown character; their respect for him had gone up, he could see; their liking for him down, if they’d ever had any—he didn’t know!","他让他们见识了自己的个性，他们对他的尊敬程度增加了，这他看得出来；但是，他们对他的好感却降低了，他们对他有没有过好感呢？——这他就不知道了！"
"But why had Elderson veered round?","但是埃尔德森为什么突然改词了呢？"
"He recalled the shift and blink of the fellow’s steely eyes at the idea of the question being raised at the general meeting.","他回想起来，就在他说要将此事提交股东大会时，那家伙冷峻的眼神突然闪烁不定起来。"
"That had done it!","他就是为这个改口的！"
"But why?","可是，为什么呢？"
"Were the figures faked?","是因为数字作假了吗？"
"Surely not!","当然不是！"
"That would be too difficult, in the face of the accountants.","在那些会计师的眼皮子底下作假，那可太难了。"
"If Soames had faith, it was in chartered accountants.","如果说索姆斯还相信什么的话，那就是相信那些持有皇家特许状的会计师了。"
"Sandis and Jevon were tip-top people.","桑迪斯和杰文两人都是最棒的会计师。"
"It couldn’t be that!","捏造数字是不可能的！"
"He glanced up from the pavement.","他站在人行道上抬头望去。"
"The dome of St. Paul’s was dim already in evening sky—nothing to be had out of it!","圣保罗教堂的圆顶在夜幕下已经模糊不清——什么都看不清了！"
"He felt badly in need of some one to talk to; but there was nobody; and he quickened his pace among the hurrying crowd.","他迫切地想找个人聊聊，但是身边连个说话的人都没有，于是他在匆忙的人群中加快了脚步。"
"His hand, driven deep into his overcoat pocket, came into sudden contact with some foreign sticky substance.","他把手深深地插入外衣的口袋，突然碰到了一种异样的、黏糊糊的东西。"
"‘Gracious!’ he thought: ‘those things!’","“啊呀！”他想道，“是那些东西！”"
"Should he drop them in the gutter?","该把它们扔进水沟里吗？"
"If only there were a child he could take them home to!","要是家里有孩子的话，就能把它们带回去了！"
"He must get Annette to speak to Fleur.","他得让安妮特跟弗勒谈谈了。"
"He knew what came of bad habits from his own experience of long ago.","他自己多年前的亲身经历让他清楚地知道陋习会产生什么样的恶果。"
"Why shouldn’t he speak to her himself?","为什么他不自己去跟她谈呢？"
"He was staying the night there!","今晚他就住在她那里呀！"
"But there came on him a helpless sense of ignorance.","但是他觉得很无助，不知道该怎么做。"
"These young people!","这些年轻人啊！"
"What did they really think and feel?","他们究竟是怎么想的，有什么样的感觉？"
"Was old Mont right?","老蒙特是对的吗？"
"Had they given up interest in everything except the moment, abandoned all belief in continuity, and progress?","难道他们除了眼前的事，对其他任何事都不感兴趣了吗，对繁衍和进化全都不相信了吗？"
"True enough that Europe was in Queer Street.","的确，欧洲如今负债累累。"
"But look at the state of things after the Napoleonic Wars.","但是看看经历过拿破仑战争后的情况。"
"He couldn’t remember his grandfather ‘Superior Dosset,’ the old chap had died five years before he was born, but he perfectly remembered how Aunt Ann, born in 1799, used to talk about “that dreadful Bonaparte—we used to call him Boney, my dear;” of how her father could get eight or ten per cent. for his money; and of what an impression ‘those Chartists’ had made on Aunts Juley and Hester, and that was long afterwards.","他记不得自己的祖父“高傲的多塞特”，那个老头早在他出生前5年就去世了。但是，他却清清楚楚地记得生于1799年的安姑妈。她以前总是说：“那个可怕的波拿巴——我们总是叫他博尼，亲爱的。”她会说他的父亲怎么为他自己的钱挣到8%或是10%的利息，还会说“那些宪章运动者”给朱莉姑姑和赫斯特姑姑留下了怎样深刻的印象。这都是很久之后的事情了。"
"Yet, in spite of all that, look at the Victorian era—a golden age, things worth collecting, children worth having!","然而，尽管经历了上述种种情况，但是看看维多利亚时代——一个黄金时代，有值得收藏的器物，也有值得养育的儿女！"
"Why not again!","为什么不再来一个这样的时代呢？"
"Consols had risen almost continuously since Timothy died.","蒂莫西死后，统一公债几乎是接连不断地一涨再涨。"
"Even if Heaven and Hell had gone, they couldn’t be the reason; none of his uncles had believed in either, and yet had all made fortunes, and all had families, except Timothy and Swithin.","就算是天堂和地狱都不存在了，都不能成为这么做的理由。他的叔叔伯伯们没有谁相信有天堂或是地狱的存在，但是他们却都发了财，也都成了家，就只有蒂莫西和斯威森没有家小。"
"No!","不！"
"It couldn’t be the want of Heaven and Hell!","这不可能是因为缺少天堂和地狱造成的！"
"What, then, was the reason of the change—if change there really were?","那么，什么才是造成这种变化的原因呢——如果真的有变化的话？"
"And suddenly it was revealed to Soames.","索姆斯突然明白了。"
"They talked too much—too much and too fast!","他们说话太多了——太多而且太快！"
"They got to the end of interest in this and that and the other.","他们失去了对这个、那个或是其他事物的兴趣。"
"They ate life and threw away the rind, and—and—.","他们吞噬了人生，丢掉了人生的果皮，然后——然后——"
"By the way, he must buy that picture of George’s!...","顺便说一下，他一定要把乔治那幅画买下来！……"
"Had these young folk more mind than his own generation?","难道这些年轻人比他们这代人想的更多吗？"
"And if so—why?","如果是这样的话——又是为什么呢？"
"Was it diet?","是饮食造成的吗？"
"That lobster cocktail Fleur had given him the Sunday before last.","就是上上周日弗勒给他吃的那个龙虾冷盘。"
"He had eaten the thing—very nasty!","他居然把那东西吃了——那么恶心的东西！"
"But it hadn’t made him want to talk.","但这东西并没有使得他想要说话。"
"No!","不！"
"He didn’t think it could be diet.","他认为不可能是饮食造成的。"
"Besides—Mind!","何况——还有头脑！"
"Where were the minds now that equalled the Victorians—Darwin, Huxley, Dickens, Disraeli, even old Gladstone?","现在哪里有能媲美维多利亚时代的人——达尔文、赫胥黎、狄更斯、迪斯累里，甚至老格莱斯顿？"
"Why, he remembered judges and advocates who seemed giants compared with those of the present day, just as he remembered that the judges of James his father’s youth had seemed giants to James compared with those of Soames’ prime.","唉，他想起以前的那些法官和律师，同现在这些同行相比，那些都是巨人了。就像他记得在他父亲詹姆斯看来，詹姆斯年轻时的那些法官和儿子索姆斯年轻时的那些法官相比的话，也是巨人一般的。"
"According to that, mind was steadily declining.","照此看来，大脑的确是逐渐退化了。"
"It must be something else.","但是，一定还有别的什么缘故。"
"There was a thing they called psycho-analysis, which so far as he could understand attributed people’s action not to what they ate at breakfast, or the leg they got out of bed with, as in the good old days, but to some shock they had received in the remote past and entirely forgotten.","有一种被称为心理分析的东西，根据他的理解，并没有像过去那样，把人们的行动归结为早餐吃的什么或是早晨起床时先迈出的是哪条腿，而是归结为人们已经忘却的、很早以前曾受过的精神冲击。"
"The subconscious mind!","潜意识！"
"Fads!","时尚！"
"Fads and microbes!","流行和微生物！"
"The fact was this generation had no digestion.","事实就是，这一代人根本没有消化能力。"
"His father and his uncles had all complained of liver, but they had never had anything the matter with them—no need of any of these vitamins, false teeth, mental healing, newspapers, psycho-analysis, spiritualism, birth control, osteopathy, broadcasting, and what not.","他的父亲、他的叔叔伯伯们都曾经抱怨说自己的肝脏不好，但是他们从来没得过什么大毛病——不需要什么维生素、假牙、精神治疗、报纸、精神分析、招魂术、计划生育、整骨疗法、广播等等。"
"‘Machines!’ thought Soames.","“机器！”索姆斯想道，"
"‘That’s it—I shouldn’t wonder!’","“就是这个——这就不足为奇了！”"
"How could you believe in anything when everything was going round so fast?","如果一切都这么快速地运转的话，你还怎么能相信什么东西呢？"
"When you couldn’t count your chickens—they ran about so?","如果你养的小鸡四下乱跑，你又怎么去数它们的数目呢？"
"But Fleur had got a good little head on her!","但是，弗勒有一个很棒的小脑瓜！"
"‘Yes,’ he mused, ‘and French teeth, she can digest anything.","“是啊，”他默默地想着，“她还有一副法国牙齿，能消化任何东西。"
"Two years!","两年了！"
"I’ll speak to her before she gets the habit confirmed.","我得在她还没有养成这个习惯之前，和她谈谈。"

"A gentleman was waiting.","他告诉索姆斯，有位先生在等他。"
"“What gentleman?” said Soames, sidelong.","“哪位先生？”索姆斯侧着身问道。"
"“I think he’s your nephew, sir, Mr. Dartie.”","“先生，我想他是您的外甥，达尔蒂先生。”"
"“Val Dartie!","“瓦尔·达尔蒂！"
"H’m!","哦！"
"Where?”","他人呢？”"
"“In the little room, sir.”","“在小房间里，先生。”"
"The little room—all the accommodation considered worthy of such as were not Connoisseurs—was at the end of a passage, and in no taste at all, as if the Club were saying: “See what it is not to be one of us!”","那个小房间在走廊的末端——只有非会员才配呆在那种地方。那里毫无品味，就好像是这家俱乐部在说：“瞧瞧，非会员就是这么个待遇！”"
"Soames entered it, and saw Val Dartie smoking a cigarette and gazing with absorption at the only object of interest, his own reflection in the glass above the fire.","索姆斯走了进去，看到瓦尔·达尔蒂正在一边抽烟一边全神贯注地盯着这里唯一有趣的东西——壁炉上方的镜子，看镜中的自己。"
"He never saw his nephew without wondering when he would say: “Look here, Uncle Soames, I’m up a stump.”","他每次看见自己的外甥，总免不了要想到他又要跟自己说：“索姆斯舅舅，你瞧，我又遇上麻烦了。”"

"I just wanted to ask you: Must I take these screws of old George Forsyte’s?","我只是想问问您：我非得接受老乔治·福赛特的那几匹驽马吗？"
"They’re dashed bad.”","它们真的很糟。”"
"“Gift horse in the mouth?” said Soames.","“对礼物不满意吗？”索姆斯问道。"
"“Well,” said Val, “but they’re SO dashed bad; by the time I’ve paid legacy duty, boxed them to a sale, and sold them, there won’t be a sixpence.","“哎呀，”瓦尔说道，“可是它们实在太糟糕了，就算等我付完遗产税，把它们装在箱子里运出去卖的话，三匹加在一起也卖不了六便士。"
"One of them falls down when you look at it.","其中一匹马，一见人就会摔倒。"
"And the other two are broken-winded.","另外两匹都有气喘病。"
"The poor old boy kept them, because he couldn’t get rid of them.","那个可怜的老头子养着它们，是因为他甩不掉它们。"

"“Thought you were fond of horses,” said Soames.","“我还以为你喜欢马呢。”索姆斯说道，"
"“Can’t you turn them out?”","“你就不能把它们放了？”"
"“Yes,” said Val, drily; “but I’ve got my living to make.","“我是喜欢马，”瓦尔淡淡地说，“但是我也得养家糊口啊。"
"I haven’t told my wife, for fear she should suggest that.","我没告诉我老婆，就是怕她会让我把它们放了。"
"I’m afraid I might see them in my dreams if I sold them.","要是我把马卖了，我怕是做梦都会梦见它们。"
"They’re only fit for the kennels.","这些马只适合养在狗窝里。"
"Can I write to the executors and say I’m not rich enough to take them?”","我能不能给遗嘱执行人写信，就说我没钱，养不起它们？”"
"“You can,” said Soames, and the words: “How’s your wife?” died unspoken on his lips.","“可以。”索姆斯说着，把到了嘴边的“你太太怎么样了？”的问话咽了回去。"
"She was the daughter of his enemy, young Jolyon.","她是他的仇人——小乔利恩的女儿。"
"That fellow was dead, but the fact remained.","虽然那家伙死了，他们之间的敌对关系却没变。"
"“I will, then,” said Val.","“那么，就这么办了。”瓦尔说，"
"“How did his funeral go off?”","“他的葬礼办得怎么样了？”"
"“Very simple affair—I had nothing to do with it.”","“非常简单——我没管这事。”"
"The days of funerals were over.","办葬礼的日子已经过去了。"
"No flowers, no horses, no plumes—a motor hearse, a couple of cars or so, was all the attention paid nowadays to the dead.","没有鲜花，没有马匹，没有羽饰——就只有一辆机动灵车和两三辆小汽车，这就是现今人们对死者的全部关照。"
"Another sign of the times!","这个时代的又一项标志！"
"“I’m staying the night at Green Street,” said Val.","“我今天晚上住在格林大街。”瓦尔说道，"
"“I suppose you’re not there, are you?”","“我想您不在那儿吧，对吗？”"
"“No,” said Soames, and did not miss the relief in his nephew’s countenance.","“不在，”索姆斯说。他外甥脸上的那种欣慰的表情没有逃出他的眼睛。"
"“Oh! by the way, Uncle Soames—do you advise me to buy P.P.R.S. shares?”","“对了，索姆斯舅舅——您会建议我买天佑再保险公司的股票吗？”"
"“On the contrary.","“正好相反。"
"I’m going to advise your mother to sell.","我正准备劝你母亲抛出她的股票呢。"
"Tell her I’m coming in tomorrow.”","转告你母亲，就说我明天过去。”"
"“Why?","“为什么？"
"I thought—”","我原以为——”"

"“So long, then!”","“那我走了，再见！”"
"Exchanging a chilly hand-shake, he watched his nephew withdraw.","两人冷冷地握了握手，然后索姆斯看着外甥退了出去。"
"So long!","再见！"

"And old Fontenoy, and that waiter over there; and the out-of-works and the inworks; and those chaps in Parliament, and the parsons in their pulpits—what were they all for?","老福坦诺、那边那个侍者、有工作的和没工作的人、议会里的那些议员以及教堂里的牧师——他们为了什么而活着呢？"
"There was the old gardener down at Mapledurham pushing his roller over and over the lawn, week after week, and if he didn’t, what would the lawn be like?","在梅普尔达勒姆那个地方有一个老园丁，日复一日地推着车修剪草坪，要是他不修剪的话，草坪会变成什么样子？"
"That was life—gardener rolling lawn!","这就是人生——就像园丁修剪草坪一样！"
"Put it that there was another life—he didn’t believe it, but for the sake of argument—that life must be just the same.","假如说有另外一种人生的话——他是不会信的，但是作为讨论的基础，姑且这样假设——那种生活也一定是一样的。"
"Rolling lawn—to keep it lawn!","有人推着车修剪草坪——使它有个草坪的样子！"

"Conscious of pessimism, he rose.","他觉得自己想得太悲观了，于是站了起来。"
"He had better be getting back to Fleur’s—they dressed for dinner!","他还是赶快回到弗勒家去吧——他们穿礼服吃晚餐！"
"He supposed there was something in dressing for dinner, but it was like lawn—you came unrolled—undressed again, and so it went on!","他想，穿礼服吃晚餐总会有什么原因的吧，但是就像草坪一样——有时不修剪——有时脱下礼服，就这么循环下去！"
"Over and over and over to keep up to a pitch, that was—ah! what WAS the pitch for?","一遍又一遍地做同样的事只是为了保持一个高度，那就是——哎呀！这些高度又是为了什么呀？"
"Turning into South Square, he cannoned into a young man, whose head was craned back as if looking after some one he had parted from.","他拐进南广场的时候，突然和一个年轻人撞在了一起。那个年轻人正在扭着脖子朝后看，像是在看着某个刚刚和他分手的什么人。"
"Uncertain whether to apologise or to wait for an apology, Soames stood still.","索姆斯不知道自己是该道歉还是应该等着接受别人的道歉，于是索性站在那里，不动了。"
"The young man said abruptly: “Sorry, sir,” and moved on; dark, neat-looking chap with a hungry look obviously unconnected with his stomach.","那个年轻人突然说了声：“对不起，先生。”然后走开了。这是个皮肤黝黑的小伙子，穿得很整洁，脸上那贪婪渴望的神色，很明显不是因为肚子饿了。"

"If she once took to gadding about!","如果她已经开始四处寻欢作乐的话！"
"He put it off, however, till he was about to say “Goodnight”—Michael having gone to the political meeting of a Labour candidate, as if he couldn’t find something better to do!","但是，他并没有立即开口谈这事，直到快该说“晚安”的时候——那时迈克尔已经去参加一位工党候选人的政治集会去了，仿佛他找不到什么更好的事情可做似的！"
"“Now you’ve been married two years, my child, I suppose you’ll be looking towards the future.","“孩子，现在你结婚都两年了，我觉得你得为将来考虑一下了。"
"There’s a great deal of nonsense talked about children.","人们说过很多关于孩子的蠢话。"
"The whole thing’s much simpler.","但是这个事情其实没那么复杂。"
"I hope you feel that.”","我希望你也是这样想的。”"
"Flour was leaning back among the cushions of the settee, swinging her foot.","弗勒坐在长靠椅上，倚着一堆靠垫，晃着小脚。"
"Her eyes became a little restless, but her colour did not change.","她的眼神变得有些不安，但脸色并没有什么变化。"
"“Of course!” she said; “only there’s no hurry, Dad.”","“当然啦！”她说道，“只是这事不着急啊，爸爸。”"
"“Well, I don’t know,” Soames murmured.","“唉，我不明白。”索姆斯低声说，"
"“The French and the royal family have a very sound habit of getting it over early.","“法国人和英国皇室都有一种好习惯——早点儿把这事完成。"
"There’s many a slip and it keeps them out of mischief.","要知道，世上哪有十全十美的事情，早点儿有了孩子，才不会惹是生非。"

"“Oh! yes.”","“是啊！很好啊。”"
"“Well, then, why not?","“嗯，那么，为什么不要孩子呢？"
"You must remember that your son will be a what-you-call-it.”","你一定还记得，你的孩子将来是会继承那个你所说的什么头衔的。”"
"In those words he compromised with his instinctive dislike of titles and flummery of that nature.","尽管他生来就不喜欢那些头衔和此类的恭维，但是说这些话的时候，他做出了让步。"
"“It mightn’t be a son,” said Fleur.","“也许不是个男孩呢。”弗勒说。"
"“At your age that’s easily remedied.”","“你这么年轻，很容易补救的。”"
"“Oh, I don’t want a lot, Dad.","“啊，爸，我可不想生一堆小孩。"

"“Well,” said Soames, “I should almost prefer a daughter, something like—well, something like you.”","“好啊。”索姆斯说，“我倒更喜欢女儿，一个像——嗯，像你这样的女孩。”"
"Her softened eyes flew, restive, from his face to her foot, to the dog, all over the room.","她的眼神变得柔和了，目光也不再停在一处，而是四下移动：看看老爸的脸，看看自己的脚，看看小狗，看看整个房间。"
"“I don’t know, it’s a tie—like digging your own grave in a way.”","“我不明白，那是一种束缚——在某程度上，就像是自掘坟墓。”"
"“I shouldn’t put it as high as that,” murmured Soames, persuasively.","“我觉得没那么严重。”索姆斯带着说服的口吻轻声说着。"
"“No man would, Dad.”","“男人都觉得不严重，爸爸。”"
"“Your mother wouldn’t have got on at all without you,” and recollection of how near her mother had been to not getting on at all with her—of how, but for him, she would have made a mess of it, reduced him to silent contemplation of the restive foot.","“要是没有你，你妈早就过不下去了。”他说着又想起她妈妈差点儿就不要她了——要不是他，那女人可能会把事情搞得一团糟。想到这里，他不吭声了，默默地看着那只脚晃来晃去。"
"“Well,” he said, at last, “I thought I’d mention it.","“好了，”最后他说，“我想我以前跟你说过的。"

"If there was point in anything, it was in perpetuation of oneself, though, of course, that begged the question.","如果有什么事情是真正有意义的话，那就是传宗接代了。当然了，这件事情尚无定论。"
"‘Wonder,’ he thought, ‘if I ought to have asked her whether that young man—!’","“我不知道，”他想道，“该不该问问她，那个年轻人是不是——”"

"The fact was, he didn’t understand them.","实际上，他根本不了解年轻人。"
"His eye lighted on the paper bag containing those—those things he had bought.","他的目光落在那只纸袋上，那里面装着那些——那些他买来的东西。"
"He had brought them up from his overcoat to get rid of them—but how?","他从外衣口袋里把它们拿了出来，想要扔掉——可是怎么扔呢？"
"Put into the fire, they would make a smell.","扔到火里的话，会有味道的。"
"He stood at his dressing-table, took one up and looked at it.","他站在梳妆台前，拿起一个气球看了看。"
"Good Lord!","天啊！"
"And, suddenly, rubbing the mouthpiece with his handkerchief, he began to blow the thing up.","突然，他拿起手绢擦了擦那个吹气口，然后开始吹了起来。"
"He blew until his cheeks were tired, and then, nipping the aperture, took a bit of the dental cotton he used on his teeth every night and tied it up.","他吹呀吹呀，直到两颊都累了才停下来，用手捏着气球口，拿出一根平日清洁牙齿用的牙线来把气球扎了起来。"

"With a pettish gesture he batted the balloon.","他像个孩子一样，急忙用手把气球拍了起来。"
"Off it flew—purple and extravagant, alighting on his bed.","它飞起来了——紫红色的，那么大，飘到了他的床上。"
"H’m!","嗯！"
"He took up the other, and did the same to it.","他把另一个气球也拿起来，同样地吹了起来。"
"Purple and green!","紫色的和绿色的！"
"The deuce!","糟了！"
"If any one came in and saw!","要是有人走进来看见怎么办！"
"He threw up the window, batted them, balloon after balloon, into the night, and shut the window down.","他打开窗户，把气球一只一只地拍了出去，拍进黑暗里，然后关上了窗户。"
"There they’d be in the dark, floating about.","气球将在黑暗中四处飘荡。"
"His lips contracted in a nervous grin.","他扯动嘴角，不安地做出一个笑脸。"
"People would see them in the morning.","早上，人们就会看见它们了。"
"Well!","唉！"
"What else could you do with things like that?","这样的东西，还能怎么处置它们？"

"Chapter XIII","第十三章"
"Tenterhooks","焦虑不安"
"Michael had gone to the Labour candidate’s meeting partly because he wanted to, and partly out of fellow feeling for ‘old Forsyte,’ whom he was always conscious of having robbed.","迈克尔之所以去参加工党候选人的集会，一部分是因为他自己想去，一部分是出于对“老福赛特”的同情，他总是觉得他夺了“老福赛特”的心头爱。"
"His father-in-law had been very decent about Fleur, and he liked the ‘old man’ to have her to himself when he could.","他的岳父一向对弗勒很好，因此只要他能办到，他就让这位“老人”单独和她呆在一起。"
"In a constituency which had much casual and no trades-union labour to speak of, the meeting would be one of those which enabled the intellectuals of the Party to get it ‘off their chests.’","在一个有许多临时工而且完全没有工会会员的选区里，这次集会将令党内知识分子们能够“直抒胸臆”。"
"Sentiment being ‘slop,’ and championship mere condescension, one might look for sound economic speeches which left out discredited factors, such as human nature.","由于可以“滔滔不绝”地抒发情感，获胜时也可以尽情展现优越感，人们可以在这里听到纯经济意义上的演讲。这种演讲摒弃了诸如人性之类的不可信的因素。"
"Michael was accustomed to hearing people disparaged for deprecating change because human nature was constant; he was accustomed to hearing people despised for feeling compassion; he knew that one ought to be purely economic.","迈克尔听惯了诽谤那些由于坚持人性永恒论而反对变革的人的话，他也听惯了鄙视那些富有同情心的人的话。他知道，这种演讲应该是纯经济意义上的。"
"And anyway that kind of speech was preferable to the tub-thumpings of the North or of the Park, which provoked a nasty underlying class spirit in himself.","不管怎样，这种演讲比北方的或者公园里的大吹大擂的演讲要好得多，因为那些演讲只会在他心中激起一种潜在的肮脏的阶级意识。"
"The meeting was in full swing when he arrived, the candidate pitilessly exposing the fallacies of a capitalism which, in his view, had brought on the war.","当迈克尔到达的时候，集会正热火朝天地进行着，那个候选人正在毫不客气地揭露资本主义的种种弊端，在他看来，正是资本主义导致了这场战争。"
"For fear that it should bring on another, it must be changed for a system which would ensure that nations should not want anything too much.","为了避免它引起另一场战争，就必须用另一种制度取代它——一种能够保证各个国家都不会贪得无厌的制度。"
"The individual—said the candidate—was in every respect superior to the nation of which he formed a part; and the problem before them was to secure an economic condition which would enable the individual to function freely in his native superiority.","每一个人——这个候选人说——在每一个方面都比他所属的民族要优越，摆在他们面前的问题就是要获得一种经济条件，来让每一个人自由地发挥他与生俱来的优越性。"
"In that way alone, he said, would they lose those mass movements and emotions which imperilled the sanity of the world.","他认为，只有这样，人们才能摆脱危害人类理智的群众运动和大众情绪。"
"He spoke well.","他讲得很精彩。"
"Michael listened, purring almost audibly, till he found that he was thinking of himself, Wilfrid and Fleur.","迈克尔一直听着，忍不住啧啧称赞，直到他发现他想到了自己、威尔弗里德和弗勒。"
"Would he ever function so freely in a native superiority that he did not want Fleur too much?","他能否非常自由地发挥他与生俱来的优越性，从而使自己不太需要弗勒呢？"
"And did he wish to?","他是否愿意这样做呢？"
"He did not.","他不愿意。"
"That seemed to introduce human nature into the speaker’s argument.","那样似乎就把人性引入到了那个演讲者的观点里了。"
"Didn’t everybody want something too much?","每一个人不都是贪得无厌的吗？"
"Wasn’t it natural?","这不是很自然的吗？"
"And if so, wouldn’t there always be a collective wanting too much—poolings of primary desire, such as the desire of keeping your own head above water?","如果是这样，那岂不是始终存在一种共同的贪得无厌——诸如使自己免遭灭顶之灾的这类基本欲望的集合呢？"
"The candidate’s argument seemed to him suddenly to leave out heat, to omit friction, to be that of a man in an armchair after a poor lunch.","他突然觉得那个候选人的言论忽视了问题的症结，忽略了矛盾，变成了一个吃了一顿糟糕的午餐的男人坐在扶手椅上发表的言论。"
"He looked attentively at the speaker’s shrewd, dry, doubting face.","他聚精会神地看着演讲者那张精明的、冷漠的、令人质疑的脸。"
"‘No juice!’ he thought.","“毫无意义！”他想。"
"And when ‘the chap’ sat down, he got up and left the hall.","于是当“那个家伙”坐下之后，他就起身离开了大厅。"
"This Wilfrid business had upset him horribly.","威尔弗里德这件事让他非常心烦意乱。"
"Try as he had to put it out of his mind, try as he would to laugh it off, it continued to eat into his sense of security and happiness.","虽然他试着将这件事抛诸脑后，虽然他试着对这件事一笑而过，但是这件事仍然不断地侵蚀着他的安全感和幸福感。"
"Wife and best friend!","妻子和最好的朋友！"
"A hundred times a day he assured himself that he trusted Fleur.","他每天说服自己一百次，让自己确信他是信任弗勒的。"
"Only, Wilfrid was so much more attractive than himself, and Fleur deserved the best of everything.","只是，威尔弗里德比自己更有吸引力，而弗勒应该得到一切最好的。"
"Besides, Wilfrid was going through torture, and it was not a pleasant thought!","不仅如此，想到威尔弗里德正在遭受着折磨，这也令他很难过。"
"How end the thing, restore peace of mind to himself, to him, to her?","如何了结这件事，让他自己、他和她都恢复内心的平静呢？"
"She had told him nothing; and it simply was impossible to ask.","她什么也没有对他说，他也绝不可能去问她。"
"No way even of showing his anxiety!","他甚至不能表现出焦虑！"
"The whole thing was just ‘dark,’ and, so far as he could see, would have to stay so; nothing to be done but screw the lid on tighter, be as nice as he could to her, try not to feel bitter about him.","整个这件事“不能挑明”，而且在他看来，这件事不得不继续保持现有的状态。除了控制住自己的脾气，尽可能地对她好，尽量不去记恨他，没有别的办法。"
"Hades!","真见鬼！"
"He turned down Chelsea Embankment.","他转过弯，沿着切尔西堤岸走着。"
"Here the sky was dark and wide and streaming with stars.","这里的天空黑暗而宽广，繁星点点。"
"The river wide, dark and gleaming with oily rays from the Embankment lamps.","河面很宽阔，黑暗的河水在堤岸灯的映照下闪烁着油亮的波光。"
"The width of it all gave him relief.","这一切广阔的景象让他感到解脱。"
"Dash the dumps!","去他的忧郁！"
"A jolly, queer, muddled, sweet and bitter world; an immensely intriguing game of chance, no matter how the cards were falling at the moment!","一个愉快的、奇怪的、混乱的、甜蜜的和痛苦的世界，一种极其有趣的赌博游戏，无论当时是怎样出的牌！"
"In the trenches he had thought: ‘Get out of this, and I’ll never mind anything again!’","当年在战壕里他曾经想过：“只要能从这里出去，以后什么事情我都不在乎了！”"
"How seldom now he remembered thinking that!","现在他很少能记起当时想过这个了！"
"The human body renewed itself—they said—in seven years.","据说，人的身体每七年更新一次。"
"In three years’ time his body would not be the body of the trenches, but a whole-time peace body with a fading complex.","再过三年，他的身体就不是战壕里的那个身体了，而是逐渐没了恐惧、永远安宁的身体。"
"If only Fleur would tell him quite openly what she felt, what she was doing about Wilfrid, for she must be doing something!","要是弗勒能把她对威尔弗里德的看法和她对威尔弗里德所做的事情都坦白地告诉他就好了，她一定在做着什么事情！"
"And Wilfrid’s verse?","还有威尔弗里德的诗呢？"
"Would his confounded passion—as Bart suggested—flow in poetry?","他那该死的热恋会不会——如准爵爷所说——化为诗歌呢？"
"And if so, who would publish it?","如果会，那么谁会将它出版呢？"
"A miserable business!","真是一件痛苦的事情！"
"Well the night was beautiful, and the great thing not to be a pig.","唉，夜晚是美丽的，而重要的是，不要做一个贪婪的人。"
"Beauty and not being a pig!","美丽而不贪婪！"
"Nothing much else to it—except laughter—the comic side!","乐观处之——除了大笑——再也没有别的什么了！"
"Keep one’s sense of humour, anyway!","无论如何，要保持幽默感！"
"And Michael searched, while he strode beneath plane trees half-stripped of leaves and plume-like in the dark, for the fun in his position.","于是迈克尔一边大步走在那树叶落了一半、在黑暗中像羽毛一样的法国梧桐树下，一边寻找着他的处境的可笑之处。"
"He failed to find it.","他找不出来。"
"There seemed absolutely nothing funny about love.","似乎爱情是完全没有什么可笑之处的。"
"Possibly he might fall out of love again some day, but not so long as she kept him on her tenterhooks.","也许有朝一日他会再次放弃爱情，但是只要她一直令他焦虑不安，他就还是放弃不了。"
"Did she do it on purpose?","她是故意这样做的吗？"
"Never!","绝对不是！"
"Fleur simply could not be like those women who kept their husbands hungry and fed them when they wanted dresses, furs, jewels.","弗勒绝对不像那些女人。她们一直吊着丈夫的胃口，当她们想要衣服、皮草和珠宝的时候才满足他们一下。"
"Revolting!","真令人恶心！"
"He came in sight of Westminster.","他来到能看见威斯敏斯特的地方。"
"Only half-past ten!","刚刚10点半！"
"Suppose he took a cab to Wilfrid’s rooms, and tried to have it out with him.","他可以乘出租车到威尔弗里德的住处，然后设法把这件事向他摊牌。"
"It would be like trying to make the hands of a clock move backwards to its ticking.","这就像是企图让钟表的指针滴滴答答地倒着走一样。"
"What use in saying: “You love Fleur—well, don’t!” or in Wilfrid saying it to him.","假如他对威尔弗里德说：“你爱弗勒——唉，别爱她了！”或者是威尔弗里德这样对他说，又有什么用呢？"
"‘After all, I was first with Fleur,’ he thought.","“毕竟，我是第一个和弗勒好的人。”他想。"
"Pure chance, perhaps, but fact!","也许这纯属运气，但这也是事实！"
"Ah!","啊！"
"And wasn’t that just the danger?","这不正是危险所在吗？"
"He was no longer a novelty to her—nothing unexpected about him now!","对于她来说，他已经不再新奇了——现在她对他已经了如指掌！"
"And he and she had agreed times without number that novelty was the salt of life, the essence of interest and drama.","而且他和她曾经无数次地一致认为，新奇是生活的调味剂，是兴趣和戏剧的本质。"
"Novelty now lay with Wilfrid!","现在威尔弗里德才是新奇的！"
"Lord!","上帝啊！"
"Lord!","上帝啊！"
"Possession appeared far from being nine points of the law!","占有者似乎在诉讼中远远不占上风！"
"He rounded-in from the Embankment towards home—jolly part of London, jolly Square; everything jolly except just this infernal complication.","他从堤岸绕了一圈，朝家走去——堤岸是伦敦的一个愉快的地方、一个愉快的广场，除了这该死的感情纠葛，一切都是愉快的。"
"Something, soft as a large leaf, tapped twice against his ear.","有个像大树叶一样柔软的东西轻轻地碰了他的耳朵两下。"
"He turned, astonished; he was in empty space, no tree near.","他回过头去，吃了一惊，他是在一片空地上，周围没有一棵树。"
"Floating in the darkness, a round thing—he grabbed, it bobbed.","一个圆圆的东西在黑暗中飘荡着——他伸手去抓，它上下摆动。"
"What?","那是什么？"
"A child’s balloon!","一只小孩子玩的气球！"
"He secured it between his hands, took it beneath a lamp-post—green, he judged.","他双手把它抓住，拿到路灯下去看——他看到是绿色的。"
"Queer!","奇怪！"
"He looked up.","他抬头看去。"
"Two windows lighted, one of them Fleur’s!","两个窗户里有灯光，其中一个是弗勒房间的窗户！"
"Was this the bubble of his own happiness expelled?","这气球是不是就是他自己幸福的气泡，被人驱赶出来了呢？"
"Morbid!","神经病！"
"Silly ass!","大笨蛋！"
"Some gust of wind—a child’s plaything lodged and loosened!","几阵风吹来的——一件小孩子的玩具，原本系着，后来松脱了！"
"He held the balloon gingerly.","他小心翼翼地拿着这只气球。"
"He would take it in and show it to her.","他要把它带回家去给她看。"
"He put his latch-key in the door.","他把弹簧锁的钥匙插进门里。"
"Dark in the hall—gone up!","门厅里一片漆黑——她已经上楼去了！"
"He mounted, swinging the balloon on his finger.","他一边上楼，一边用手指将气球晃来晃去。"
"Fleur was standing before a mirror.","弗勒正站在镜子前。"
"“What on earth’s that?” she said.","“那是什么东西啊？”她问道。"
"The blood returned to Michael’s heart.","血又流回到迈克尔的心里。"
"Curious how he had dreaded its having anything to do with her!","真奇怪，他刚才多么担心这个东西会和她有关系啊！"
"“Don’t know, darling; fell on my hat—must belong to heaven.”","“不知道，亲爱的，它落在了我的帽子上——一定是从天上掉下来的。”"
"And he batted it.","说着他把它拍了起来。"
"The balloon floated, dropped, bounded twice, wobbled and came to rest.","气球飘上去，落下来，弹了两下，晃了一会儿，就停住不动了。"
"“You ARE a baby, Michael.","“你真是个孩子，迈克尔。"
"I believe you bought it.”","我相信是你买的。”"
"Michael came closer, and stood quite still.","迈克尔向她走近了些，就站住不动了。"
"“My hat!","“天啊！"
"What a misfortune to be in love!”","爱上一个人是多么不幸啊！”"
"“You think so!”","“你是这样想的！”"
"“Il y a toujours un qui baise, et l’autre qui ne tend pas la joue.”","“既有吻别人的人，也有不肯把脸给人吻的人。”"
"“But I do.”","“但是我愿意。”"
"“Fleur!”","“弗勒！”"
"Fleur smiled.","弗勒笑了。"
"“Baise away.”","“尽情地吻吧。”"
"Embracing her, Michael thought: ‘She holds me—does with me what she likes; I know nothing of her!’","迈克尔抱着她，心里想：“她征服了我——她喜欢对我怎样就怎样吧，我一点儿也弄不懂她！”"
"And there arose a small sound—from Ting-a-ling smelling the balloon.","这时响起了一阵轻微的声音——小叮铃正在嗅那只气球。"

"Part II","第二卷"
"Chapter I","第一章"
"The Mark Falls","马克贬值"
"The state of the world had been getting more and more on Soames’ nerves ever since the general meeting of the P. P. R. S. It had gone off with that fatuity long associated by him with such gatherings—a watertight rigmarole from the chairman; butter from two reliable shareholders; vinegar from shareholders not so reliable; and the usual ‘gup’ over the dividend.","自从天佑再保险公司召开股东大会以来，索姆斯对世界局势越来越感到不安。长期以来他一直把愚蠢和这种会议联系在一起，这次大会进行过程中也充满了愚蠢的言论——董事长的无懈可击的冗长废话、两位可靠的股东的奉承话、几位不太可靠的股东的尖酸刻薄的话以及关于红利的惯常的“闲谈”。"
"He had gone there glum, come away glummer.","他去开会时闷闷不乐，离开时更是愁容满面。"
"From a notion once taken into his head Soames parted more slowly than a cheese parts from its mites.","一旦一个想法在索姆斯脑中形成，再要他放弃它，简直比小虫子离开奶酪还要慢。"
"Two-sevenths of foreign business, nearly all German!","七分之二的国外业务，几乎全部都是德国的！"
"And the mark falling!","而马克正在贬值！"
"It had begun to fall from the moment that he decided to support the dividend.","从他决定支持分红的那个时候起，马克就开始贬值了。"
"And why?","是什么原因呢？"
"What was in the wind?","会发生什么事情呢？"
"Contrary to his custom, he had taken to sniffing closely the political columns of his paper.","他一反平日的习惯，开始密切注意他读的那份报纸的政治专栏。"
"The French—he had always mistrusted them, especially since his second marriage—the French were going to play old Harry, if he was not greatly mistaken!","法国人——他向来不信任他们，尤其是从他第二次婚姻之后——除非他大错特错，法国人又要兴风作浪了！"
"Their papers, he noticed, never lost a chance of having a dab at English policy; seemed to think they could always call the tune for England to pipe to!","他注意到，他们的报纸从来不放过任何一个抨击英国政策的机会，他们似乎认为总能对英国发号施令！"
"And the mark and the franc, and every other sort of money, falling.","而马克和法郎以及其他各种货币，都在贬值。"
"And, though in Soames was that which rejoiced in the thought that one of his country’s bits of paper could buy a great quantity of other countries’ bits of paper, there was also that which felt the whole thing silly and unreal, with an ever-growing consciousness that the P. P. R. S. would pay no dividend next year.","虽然索姆斯一想到自己国家的一张纸可以买到其他国家的许多张纸就感到高兴，但是他也觉得整件事情既愚蠢又虚幻，而且他越来越清楚地知道，天佑再保险公司明年不会分红了。"
"The P. P. R. S. was a big concern; no dividend would be a sign, no small one, of bad management.","天佑再保险公司是一家大公司，不分红是经营不善的标志，还是一个不小的标志。"
"Assurance was one of the few things on God’s earth which could and should be conducted without real risk.","普天之下，能够而且应该经营得毫无实际风险的事业屈指可数，保险业就是其中之一。"
"But for that he would never have gone on the Board.","要不是这个原因，当初他是绝不会加入这个董事会的。"
"And to find assurance had not been so conducted and that by himself, was—well!","如今保险业并非经营得毫无实际风险，而发现这一点的人正是他自己，这真是——唉！"
"He had caused Winifred to sell, anyway, though the shares had already fallen slightly.","不管怎样，他已经让威妮弗雷德把股票卖掉了，虽然股票已经略微下跌了一些。"
"“I thought it was such a good thing, Soames,” she had said plaintively: “it’s rather a bore, losin’ money on the shares.”","“我以为它是件好东西呢，索姆斯，”她伤心地说，“在股票上赔了钱，真讨厌！”"
"He had answered without mercy: “If you don’t sell, you’ll lose more.”","他毫不留情地回答说：“如果不卖掉，你会赔更多。”"
"And she had done it.","于是她把股票卖掉了。"
"If the Rogers and Nicholases who had followed him into it hadn’t sold too—well, it was their look out!","如果之前跟着他买进的罗杰和尼古拉斯两家人至今还没有卖掉股票——呃，那就是他们自己的事情了！"
"He had made Winifred warn them.","他已经让威妮弗雷德提醒过他们了。"
"As for himself, he had nothing but his qualifying shares, and the missing of a dividend or two would not hurt one whose director’s fees more than compensated.","至于他自己，除了取得董事资格所必需的股份外，他一无所有，少拿一两次分红对他也没有什么损害，因为他的董事酬劳足以弥补损失，而且绰绰有余。"
"It was not, therefore, private uneasiness so much as resentment at a state of things connected with foreigners and the slur on his infallibility.","因此，与其说这是他个人的不安，还不如说是对与外国人有关的事态以及对他一贯正确的破灭所产生的愤恨。"
"Christmas had gone off quietly at Mapledurham.","圣诞节在梅普尔达勒姆汉静悄悄地过去了。"
"He abominated Christmas, and only observed it because his wife was French, and her national festival New Year’s Day.","他非常不喜欢圣诞节，因为他的妻子是法国人，而她的民族节日是元旦，所以他只能过圣诞节。"
"One could not go so far as to observe that, encouraging a foreign notion.","他总不至于要过元旦，以助长外国人的观念吧。"
"But Christmas with no child about—he still remembered the holly and snapdragons of Park Lane in his own childhood—the family parties; and how disgusted he had been if he got anything symbolic—the thimble, or the ring—instead of the shilling.","但是过圣诞节却没有孩子在身边——他还记得自己小时候公园巷里的冬青树和金鱼草——那些家庭聚会；如果他得到的只是象征性的东西——顶针或者戒指——而不是先令，他是多么厌烦。"
"They had never gone in for Santa Claus at Park Lane, partly because they could see through the old gentleman, and partly because he was not at all a late thing.","在公园巷，他们从来就不喜欢圣诞老人，一部分是因为他们看穿了这位老先生，一部分是因为圣诞老人一点儿也不新奇。"
"Emily, his mother, had seen to that.","他的母亲埃米莉注意到了那一点。"
"Yes; and, by the way, that William Gouldyng, Ingerer, had so stumped those fellows at the Heralds’ College, that Soames had dropped the enquiry—it was just encouraging them to spend his money for a sentimental satisfaction which did not materialise.","的确如此。顺便提一下，威廉·古尔丁·英格勒这个名字，竟然难住了纹章院的那帮家伙，使索姆斯放弃了追查——继续查下去只不过是鼓励他们花他的钱，使他获得一种无法实现的感情上的满足而已。"
"That narrow-headed chap, ‘Old Mont,’ peacocked about his ancestry; all the more reason for having no ancestry to peacock about.","“老蒙特”，这个心胸狭窄的家伙，炫耀着他的祖宗家世；越是没有祖宗家世可炫耀的人，越有理由这样做。"
"The Forsytes and the Goldings were good English country stock—that was what mattered.","福赛特家族和戈尔丁家族都是英国乡村的名门望族——这才是最关键的。"
"And if Fleur and her child, if one came, had French blood in them—well, he couldn’t help it now.","如果弗勒和她的孩子，假如她生一个孩子，身上有法国血统——唉，现在他也无能为力啦。"
"In regard to the coming of a grandchild, Soames knew no more than in October.","关于是否会有一个外孙出生，索姆斯并不比10月份那时更有把握。"
"Fleur had spent Christmas with the Monts; she was promised to him, however, before long, and her mother must ask her a question or two!","弗勒是和蒙特一家人一起过圣诞节的，但是她已经答应他，不久就会要孩子，她妈妈必须去问问情况了！"
"The weather was extremely mild; Soames had even been out in a punt fishing.","天气非常暖和，索姆斯甚至乘坐方头平底船出去游钓。"
"In a heavy coat he trailed a line for perch and dace, and caught now and then a roach—precious little good, the servants wouldn’t eat them, nowadays!","他穿了件厚厚的外套，拖着一根钓线，去钓鲈鱼和鲦鱼，偶尔还能钓到一条拟鲤——这种鱼毫无用处，如今连仆人都不吃了！"
"His grey eyes would brood over the grey water under the grey sky; and in his mind the mark would fall.","他那双灰色的眼睛注视着灰色天空下那灰色的水面，脑子里却想着马克要贬值。"
"It fell with a bump on that eleventh of January when the French went and occupied the Ruhr.","1月11日那天，当法国人出兵攻占了鲁尔区的时候，马克突然贬值了。"
"He said to Annette at breakfast: “Your country’s cracked!","他在吃早餐时对安妮特说：“你的国家疯了！"
"Look at the mark now!”","看看现在的马克！”"
"“What do I care about the mark?” she had answered over her coffee.","“我干吗要关心马克呢？”她边喝咖啡边回答，"
"“I care that they shall not come again into my country.","“我只关心德国人不要再闯入我的国家。"
"I hope they will suffer a little what we have suffered.”","我希望他们也受一点儿我们以前受过的苦！”"
"“You,” said Soames; “you never suffered anything.”","“你，”索姆斯说，“你从来没有受过什么苦。”"
"Annette put her hand where Soames sometimes doubted the existence of a heart.","安妮特把手放在心口上，索姆斯有时怀疑那地方是否真的有一颗心。"
"“I suffered here,” she said.","“我这儿受过苦。”她说。"
"“I didn’t notice it.","“我没有发现过。"
"You never went without butter.","你从来没有缺少过黄油。"
"What do you suppose Europe’s going to be like now for the next thirty years!","你认为在今后的30年里欧洲会变成什么样子！"
"How about British trade?”","英国的贸易又会怎样？”"
"“We French see before our noses,” said Annette with warmth.","“我们法国人只管眼前的事。”安妮特激动地说，"
"“We see that the beaten must be kept the beaten, or he will take revenge.","“我们明白要让战败国始终处于战败国的地位，否则他们就会进行报复。"
"You English are so sloppy.”","你们英国人太多愁善感了。”"
"“Sloppy, are we?” said Soames.","“我们多愁善感？”索姆斯说，"
"“You’re talking like a child.","“你说话就像个小孩一样。"
"Could a sloppy people ever have reached our position in the world?”","一个多愁善感的民族能达到我们在世界上的地位吗？”"
"“That is your selfishness.","“那是因为你们自私自利。"
"You are cold and selfish.”","你们既冷酷无情又自私自利。”"
"“Cold, selfish and sloppy—they don’t go together.","“冷酷无情、自私自利和多愁善感——这有些互相矛盾啊。"
"Try again.”","继续说。”"
"“Your slop is in your thought and your talk; it is your instinct that gives you your success, and your English instinct is cold and selfish, Soames.","“你们的多愁善感在你们的思想和言论里。给你们带来成功的是你们的本能，而你们英国人的本能就是冷酷无情和自私自利，索姆斯。"
"You are a mixture, all of you, of hypocrisy, stupidity and egoism.”","你和你们所有人都是虚伪、愚蠢和自私的混合体。”"
"Soames took some marmalade.","索姆斯拿了些果酱。"
"“Well,” he said, “and what are the French?—cynical, avaricious and revengeful.","“那么，”他说，“法国人又怎样呢？——愤世嫉俗、贪得无厌和睚眦必报。"
"And the Germans are sentimental, heady and brutal.","德国人则是感情用事、顽固任性和野蛮残忍。"
"We can all abuse each other.","我们都可以互相辱骂。"
"There’s nothing for it but to keep clear.","除了避免接触之外别无他法。"
"And that’s what you French won’t do.”","但这正是你们法国人不愿意做的。”"
"Annette’s handsome person stiffened.","安妮特挺直了漂亮的身躯。"
"“When you are tied to a person, as I am tied to you, Soames, or as we French are tied to the Germans, it is necessary to be top dog, or to be bottom dog.”","“当你和一个人联系在一起的时候，就像我和你联系在一起一样，索姆斯，或者像我们法国人和德国人联系在一起一样，你必须处于支配地位，否则就处于被支配地位。”"
"Soames stayed his toast.","索姆斯放下了他的烤面包。"
"“Do you suppose yourself top dog in this house?”","“你认为你自己在这个家里处于支配地位吗？”"
"“Yes, Soames.”","“是的，索姆斯。”"
"“Oh!","“哦！"
"Then you can go back to France tomorrow.”","那么你明天可以回法国去了。”"
"Annette’s eyebrows rose quizzically.","安妮特嘲弄般地扬起了眉毛。"
"“I would wait a little longer, my friend; you are still too young.”","“我还要再等一段时间，我的朋友，你还很年轻呢。”"
"But Soames had already regretted his remark; he did not wish any such disturbance at his time of life, and he said more calmly:","但是索姆斯已经后悔刚才说过的话了，他不希望在他这把年纪的时候还发生这样的争吵，于是他较为平静地说："
"“Compromise is the essence of any reasonable existence between individuals or nations.","“妥协是人与人或国与国之间合理生存的要素。"
"We can’t have the fat thrown into the fire every few years.”","我们不能每隔几年就闹一次。”"
"“That is so English,” murmured Annette.","“这就是典型的英国人。”安妮特喃喃地说，"
"“We others never know what you English will do.","“我们外国人从来不知道你们英国人要做什么。"
"You always wait to see which way the cat jumps.”","你们总是见风使舵。”"
"However deeply sympathetic with such a reasonable characteristic, Soames would have denied it at any ordinary moment—to confess to temporising was not, as it were, done.","无论索姆斯多么认同这种合情合理的特性，若在平时，他一定不会承认的——承认自己见风使舵，可以说那是绝对不行的。"
"But, with the mark falling like a cartload of bricks, he was heated to the point of standing by his nature.","但是，随着马克像一车砖块跌落似的贬值，他已经被激怒到出于本性地挺身而出了。"
"“And why shouldn’t we?","“我们为什么不能这样做呢？"
"Rushing into things that you’ll have to rush out of!","难道非要我们卷入那些你们必须摆脱的事情里去吗！"
"I don’t want to argue.","我不想争论。"
"French and English never did get on, and never will.”","法国人和英国人从来没有和睦相处过，而且永远不会和睦相处。”"
"Annette rose.","安妮特站了起来。"
"“You speak the truth, my friend.","“你说的是事实，我的朋友。"
"Entente, mais pas cordiale.","协商，但并不友好。"
"What are you doing today?”","你今天打算做什么？”"
"“Going up to town,” said Soames glumly.","“到城里去。”索姆斯闷闷不乐地说，"
"“Your precious Government has put business into Queer Street with a vengeance.”","“你的宝贝政府的复仇行为已经把经济逼入绝境了。”"
"“Do you stay the night?”","“你在那儿过夜吗？”"
"“I don’t know.”","“不知道。”"
"“Adieu, then, jusqu’ au revoir!”","“再会，那么，以后再见！”"
"And she got up.","说完她就上楼去了。"
"Soames remained brooding above his marmalade—with the mark falling in his mind—glad to see the last of her handsome figure, having no patience at the moment for French tantrums.","索姆斯仍然看着他的果酱沉思——心里想着马克贬值——他很高兴看到她那漂亮的身躯离开，因为此刻他实在是不能容忍她那法国式的坏脾气。"
"An irritable longing to say to somebody “I told you so” possessed him.","他现在急切地渴望对某个人说“我早警告过你了”。"
"He would have to wait, however, till he found somebody to say it to.","但是，他现在只能等，直到找到这么个人之后才能对他说。"
"A beautiful day, quite warm; and, taking his umbrella as an assurance against change, he set out for the station.","天气晴朗，非常暖和。他带着雨伞，以防变天，动身去了车站。"
"In the carriage going up they were talking about the Ruhr.","在进城去的车厢里，人们正在谈论着鲁尔区的事情。"
"Averse from discussion in public, Soames listened from behind his paper.","索姆斯不喜欢当众议论，他就用报纸遮住脸听着。"
"The general sentiment was surprisingly like his own.","大家的态度和他的态度惊人地相似。"
"In so far as it was unpleasant for the Huns—all right; in so far as it was unpleasant for British trade—all wrong; in so far as love of British trade was active and hate of Huns now passive—more wrong than right.","只要是对德国佬不利的——都对；只要是对英国贸易不利的——都错；只要对英国贸易的爱是积极的，对德国佬的恨是消极的——错多对少。"
"A Francophil remark that the French were justified in making themselves safe at all costs, was coldly received.","一个亲法派的人说法国人不惜一切代价确保自身安全的做法是合情合理的，大家听了都反应冷淡。"
"At Maidenhead a man got in whom Soames connected automatically with disturbance.","在梅登黑德站上来一个人，索姆斯自然而然地把他和骚乱联系在了一起。"
"He had much grey hair, a sanguine face, lively eyes, twisting eyebrows, and within five minutes had asked in a breezy voice whether anyone had heard of the League of Nations.","他的头发斑白，面色红润，眼神活跃，眉毛弯曲。还不到五分钟，他就用一种轻松愉快的声音发话了，问是否有人听说过国际联盟。"
"Confirmed in his estimate, Soames looked round the corner of his paper.","索姆斯觉得自己的判断得到了证实，他从报纸的一角向外看去。"
"Yes, that chap would get off on some hobby-horse or other!","是的，那个家伙要开始鼓吹自己喜欢的话题了。"
"And there he went!","他果然开始了！"
"The question—said the newcomer—was not whether the Germans should get one in the eye, the British one in the pocket, or the French one in the heart, but whether the world should get peace and goodwill.","问题——这个新来的家伙说——不在于德国人是不是应该当头挨一棒，英国人是不是应该在口袋里大捞一把，或者法国人是不是应该在情感上宣泄一下，而在于这个世界是不是应该获得和平与友好。"
"Soames lowered his paper.","索姆斯放下了报纸。"
"If—this fellow said—they wanted peace, they must sink their individual interests, and think in terms of collective interest.","如果——这个家伙说——他们想要和平，就必须放下个人利益，而去考虑集体利益。"
"The good of all was the good of one!","集体的利益就是个人的利益！"
"Soames saw the flaw at once.","索姆斯一眼就看出了破绽。"
"That might be, but the good of one was not the good of all.","这话也许是对的，但是个人的利益不一定是集体的利益。"
"He felt that if he did not take care he would be pointing this out.","他觉得如果自己一不小心就会指出这一点的。"
"The man was a perfect stranger to him, and no good ever came of argument.","他和这个人素不相识，跟这种人争论毫无意义。"
"Unfortunately his silence amid the general opinion that the League of Nations was ‘no earthly,’ seemed to cause the newcomer to regard him as a sympathiser; the fellow kept on throwing his eyebrows at him!","不幸的是，在大家都认为国际联盟“毫无希望”的时候，索姆斯的沉默似乎使那个新来的家伙把他当成了一个同情者，从而不断地向他使眼色！"
"To put up his paper again seemed too pointed, and his position was getting more and more false when the train ran in at Paddington.","他若再拿起报纸来，就似乎显得太有针对性了，正当他的处境越来越容易让人误会的时候，火车驶入了帕丁顿车站。"
"He hastened to a cab.","他急忙下车，走向一辆出租车。"
"A voice behind him said:","一个声音在他背后说："
"“Hopeless lot, sir, eh!","“一群无药可救的人，先生，唉！"
"Glad to see YOU saw my point.”","很高兴看到您能理解我的观点。”"
"“Quite!” said Soames.","“没错！”索姆斯说，"
"“Taxi!”","“出租车！”"
"“Unless the League of Nations functions, we’re all for Gehenna.”","“除非国际联盟发挥作用，否则我们全都得下地狱。”"
"Soames turned the handle of the cab door.","索姆斯转动出租车的门把手。"
"“Quite!” he said again.","“没错！”他又说了一句，"
"“Poultry!” and got in.","“家禽街！”然后就上了车。"
"He was not going to be drawn.","他不想被人纠缠。"
"The fellow was clearly a firebrand!","那个家伙显然是个煽动者！"
"In the cab the measure of his disturbance was revealed.","在出租车里，他的烦躁程度显现出来了。"
"He had said ‘Poultry,’ an address that ‘Forsyte, Bustard and Forsyte’ had abandoned two-and-twenty years ago when, merged with ‘Cuthcott, Holliday and Kingson,’ they became ‘Cuthcott, Kingson and Forsyte.’","他刚才说的“家禽街”，早在22年前，“福赛特、巴斯塔德和福赛特”公司就已经放弃不用这个地址了。那时他们和“卡斯考特、霍利迪和金森”公司合并，变成了“卡斯考特、金森和福赛特”公司。"
"Rectifying the error, he sat forward, brooding.","纠正了地址的错误之后，他朝前坐好，心里沉思着。"
"Fall of the mark!","马克贬值！"
"The country was sound about it, yes—but when they failed to pay the next dividend, could they rely on resentment against the French instead of against the directors?","国家对此有着充分的准备，是的——但是下次当他们不能分红的时候，他们能指望人们对法国人的怨恨会代替对董事们的怨恨吗？"
"Doubtful!","不大可能！"
"The directors ought to have seen it coming!","董事们应该预见到会发生这样的事情！"
"That might be said of the other directors, but not of himself—here was a policy that he personally never would have touched.","对其他的董事也许可以这样说，但是对他自己却不能这么说——这种政策是他本人从来没有接触过的。"
"If only he could discuss the whole thing with some one—but old Gradman would be out of his depth in a matter of this sort.","要是他能把整个事情和某人探讨一下就好了——但是这种问题不是老格雷德曼力所能及的。"
"And, on arrival at his office, he gazed with a certain impatience at that changeless old fellow, sitting in his swivel chair.","于是，他一到自己的办公室，就有点儿不耐烦地注视着那个坐在转椅中的一成不变的老家伙。"
"“Ah!","“啊！"
"Mr. Soames, I was hopin’ you might come in this morning.","索姆斯先生，我正盼着您今天早上能来呢。"
"There’s a young man been round to see you from the P. P. R. S. Wouldn’t give his business, said he wanted to see you privately.","有一个天佑再保险公司的年轻人来看您。他不肯说明来意，只说要单独和您见一面。"
"Left his number on the ‘phone.”","他留下了电话号码。”"
"“Oh!” said Soames.","“哦！”索姆斯说。"
"“Quite a young feller—in the office.”","“一个非常年轻的小伙子——在办公室工作。”"
"“What did he look like?”","“他长得什么样子？”"
"“Nice, clean young man.","“文雅、干净的年轻人。"
"I was quite favourably impressed—name of Butterfield.”","给我的印象非常不错——名叫巴特菲尔德。”"
"“Well, ring him up, and let him know I’m here.”","“那么，给他打电话，告诉他我在这儿。”"
"And going over to the window, he stood looking out on to a perfectly blank wall.","说完他走到窗前，站在那里望着窗外一面光秃秃的墙壁。"
"Suited to a sleeping partner, his room was at the back, free from disturbance.","为了适合他匿名合伙人的身份，他的房间设在后面，不受打扰。"
"Young man!","年轻人！"
"The call was somewhat singular!","这次拜访有些非同寻常！"
"And he said over his shoulder: “Don’t go when he comes, Gradman, I know nothing of him.”","他回过头说：“等他来了，你不要走开，格雷德曼，我一点儿也不了解他。”"
"The world changed, people died off, the mark fell, but Gradman was there—embodiment, faithful and grey, of service and integrity—an anchor.","世界改变了，逝者已逝，马克贬值了，但是格雷德曼还在那里——他是贡献与正直的化身，忠诚而又老练——一个可以依靠的人。"
"Gradman’s voice, grating, ingratiating, rose.","格雷德曼那刺耳而讨好的声音响了起来。"
"“This French news—it’s not nice, Mr. Soames.","“这条法国新闻——可不太妙啊，索姆斯先生。"
"They’re a hasty lot.","他们是一帮轻率的家伙。"
"I remember your father, Mr. James, coming into the office the morning the Franco-Prussian war was declared—quite in his prime then, hardly more than sixty, I should say.","我记得在普法战争宣战那天早上，您的父亲詹姆斯先生走进办公室——那时他正值壮年，还不到60岁，我记得。"
"Why, I recall his very words: ‘There,’ he said, ‘I told them so.’","哦，我想起了他的原话。‘你瞧，’他说，‘我早就告诉过他们要打仗了。’"
"And here they are—at it still.","现在他们——仍然要打。"
"The fact is, they’re cat and dog.”","事实就是，他们是猫狗不相容。”"
"Soames, who had half turned, resumed his contemplation of a void.","索姆斯半转过身，继续凝视着那一片空白处，沉思开了。"
"Poor old Gradman dated!","可怜的老格雷德曼落伍了！"
"What would he say when he heard that they had been insuring foreign business?","如果他听到他们一直在给外国生意做保险，他会怎么说呢？"
"Stimulated by the old-time quality of Gradman’s presence, his mind ranged with sudden freedom.","由于受到格雷德曼身上的往日情怀的感染，他的思绪突然自由翱翔起来。"
"He himself had another twenty years, perhaps.","或许他自己还能再活20年吧。"
"What would he see in that time?","到那时他会看到些什么呢？"
"Where would old England be at the end of it?","古老的英国最后会变成什么样子？"
"‘In spite of the papers, we’re not such fools as we look,’ he thought.","“不管报纸上怎么说，我们并不像看上去的那样傻。”他想，"
"‘If only we can steer clear of flibberty-gibberting, and pay our way!’","“要是我们能避开无谓的空谈，并且不赔本就好了！”"
"“Mr. Butterfield, sir.”","“巴特菲尔德先生来了，先生。”"
"H’m!","嗬！"
"The young man had been very spry.","这个年轻人来得可真快。"
"Covered by Gradman’s bluff and greasy greeting, he “took a lunar,” as his Uncle Roger used to call it.","在格雷德曼那既直率又圆滑的招呼的掩护之下，他可以像他叔叔罗杰过去常说的那样“观察一下”。"
"The young fellow, in a neat suit, a turndown collar, with his hat in his hand, was a medium modest-looking chap.","这个小伙子穿着一套整洁的翻领西服，手里拿着帽子，身材中等，态度谦恭。"
"Soames nodded.","索姆斯点点头。"
"“You want to see me?”","“你想要见我？”"
"“Alone, if I might, sir.”","“我想单独见您，如果可以的话，先生。”"
"“Mr. Gradman here is my right-hand man.”","“这位格雷德曼先生是我的得力助手。”"
"Gradman’s voice purred gratingly: “You can state your business.","格雷德曼的声音刺耳地响了起来：“你尽管说明你的来意。"
"Nothing goes outside these walls, young man.”","任何事情都不会传出去的，年轻人。”"
"“I’m in the office of the P.P.R.S., sir.","“我在天佑再保险公司的办公室工作，先生。"
"The fact is, accident has just put some information in my hands, and I’m not easy in my mind.","事情是这样的，我意外地得到了一些消息，我感到心里不安。"
"Knowing you to be a solicitor, sir, I preferred to come to you, rather than go to the chairman.","因为我知道您是一名律师，先生，所以我宁愿来找您，也不愿去找董事长。"
"As a lawyer, would you tell me: Is my first duty to the Society, being in their employ?”","作为一名律师，请您告诉我：作为公司的雇员，我的首要职责是不是要对它负责？”"
"“Certainly,” said Soames.","“当然。”索姆斯说。"
"“I don’t like this job, sir, and I hope you’ll understand that I’m not here for any personal motive—it’s just because I feel I ought to.”","“我不喜欢这份工作，先生，而且我希望您能明白我到这里来不是出于任何个人目的——而是因为我觉得我应该这样做。”"
"Soames regarded him steadily.","索姆斯一直注视着他。"
"Though large and rather swimming, the young man’s eyes impressed him by their resemblance to a dog’s.","虽然这个年轻人的眼睛又大又水灵，但是给他的印象却像是一条忠实的狗的眼睛。"
"“What’s it all about?” he said.","“究竟是什么事情？”他说。"
"The young man moistened his lips.","这个年轻人舔了舔嘴唇。"
"“The insurance of our German business, sir.”","“是我们在德国的保险业务，先生。”"
"Soames pricked his ears, already slightly pointed by Nature.","索姆斯那双天生就稍微有点儿尖的耳朵竖已经了起来。"
"“It’s a very serious matter,” the young man went on, “and I don’t know how it’ll affect me, but the fact is, this morning I overheard a private conversation.”","“这件事非常严重，”这个年轻人接着说，“我不知道这件事会对我产生什么影响，但事实是，今天早上我无意间听到一段私人谈话。”"
"“Oh!” said Soames.","“哦！”索姆斯说。"
"“Yes, sir.","“是的，先生。"
"I quite understand your tone, but the very first words did it.","我非常理解您的反应，但是第一句话就让我忍不住偷听下去。"
"I simply couldn’t make myself known after hearing them.","我不能让他们知道我听到了他们的谈话。"
"I think you’ll agree, sir.”","我想您会同意的，先生。”"
"“Who were the speakers?”","“谈话的人是谁？”"
"“The manager, and a man called Smith—I fancy by his accent his name’s a bit more foreign—who’s done most of the agenting for the German business.”","“经理和一个叫做史密斯的人——听他的口音，我猜想他的名字更像是个外国人的——他代理绝大部分的德国业务。”"
"“What were the words?” said Soames.","“他们谈了些什么？”索姆斯说。"
"“Well, sir, the manager was speaking, and then this Smith said: ‘Quite so, Mr. Elderson, but we haven’t paid you a commission on all this business for nothing; if the mark goes absolutely phut, you will have to see that your Society makes it good for us!’”","“嗯，先生，当时经理正在说话，然后这个史密斯说：‘的确如此，埃尔德森先生，但是在整个业务中我们不是白给你们佣金的，如果马克彻底完蛋了，你就得设法让你的公司赔偿我们的损失！’”"
"The intense longing, which at that moment came on Soames to emit a whistle, was checked by sight of Gradman’s face.","那一刻，索姆斯十分渴望吹个口哨，但是一看到格雷德曼脸上的表情，他抑制住了这种强烈的渴望。"
"The old fellow’s mouth had opened in the nest of his grizzly short beard; his eyes stared puglike, he uttered a prolonged: “A-ow!”","那个老家伙的嘴在他那灰白的鸟巢似的短须里张开了，他的眼睛瞪得像哈巴狗一样，发出一声拖长的“啊——呦！”"
"“Yes,” said the young man, “it was a knock-out!”","“是的，”年轻人说，“真是耸人听闻！”"
"“Where were you?” asked Soames, sharply.","“当时你在哪儿？”索姆斯厉声问道。"
"“In the lobby between the manager’s room and the board room.","“在经理室和董事会会议室之间的走廊里。"
"I’d just come from sorting some papers in the boardroom, and the manager’s door was open an inch or so.","我刚在会议室整理完一些文件，出来的时候，经理室的门开着一英寸左右的缝。"
"Of course I know the voices well.”","当然我非常熟悉他们的声音。”"
"“What after?”","“后来呢？”"
"“I heard Mr. Elderson say, ‘H’ssh!","“我听到埃尔德森先生说：‘嘘！"
"Don’t talk like that!’ and I slipped back into the board room.","别那么大声！’于是我又溜回了会议室。"
"I’d had more than enough, sir, I assure you.”","我听到的已经够多了，先生，我向您保证。”"
"Suspicion and surmise clogged Soames’ thinking apparatus.","怀疑和猜测充斥着索姆斯的大脑。"
"Was this young fellow speaking the truth?","这个小伙子说的是真话吗？"
"A man like Elderson—the risk was monstrous!","像埃尔德森这样的人——居然冒这样大的风险！"
"And, if true, what was the directors’ responsibility?","那么，如果是真的，董事们的责任是什么？"
"But proof—proof?","但是证据——证据呢？"
"He stared at the young man, who looked upset and pale enough, but whose eyes did not waver.","他盯着这个年轻人。年轻人看起来焦虑不安，脸色很苍白，但他的目光却很坚定。"
"Shake him if he could!","想办法诈一诈他！"
"And he said sharply:","于是他厉声说："
"“Now mind what you’re saying!","“你得注意你所说的话！"
"This is most serious!”","这是非常严重的！”"
"“I know that, sir.","“我知道，先生。"
"If I’d consulted my own interest, I’d never have come here.","如果考虑到我个人的利益，我绝不会到这来。"
"I’m not a sneak.”","我不是一个告密的人。”"
"The words rang true, but Soames did not drop his caution.","这些话听起来是真的，但是索姆斯没有放松警惕。"
"“Ever had any trouble in the office?”","“你以前在办公室出过什么问题吗？”"
"“No, sir, you can make enquiry.","“没有，先生，您可以去查问。"
"I’ve nothing against Mr. Elderson, and he’s nothing against me.”","我没有什么针对埃尔德森先生的事情，他也没有什么针对我的事情。”"
"Soames thought suddenly: ‘Good heavens!","索姆斯突然想到：“天哪！"
"He’s shifted it on to me, and in the presence of a witness!","他把这件事推到我身上了，而且还有一个证人在场！"
"And I supplied the witness!’","而这个证人又是我提供的！”"
"“Have you any reason to suppose,” he said, “that they became aware of your being there?”","“依你看，”他说，“他们是不是发现了你当时在那里呢？”"
"“They couldn’t have, I think.”","“他们不会知道的，我想。”"
"The implications of this news seemed every second more alarming.","这个消息的含义似乎每一秒钟都让人更加担忧。"
"It was as if Fate, kept at bay all his life by clever wrist-work, had suddenly slipped a thrust under his guard.","就像命运之神，一生都以巧妙的腕力使对手无法近身，却突然被对手趁其不备刺了一剑。"
"No good to get rattled, however—must think it out at leisure!","不管怎样，惊慌失措毫无用处——必须从容不迫地把它想清楚！"
"“Are you prepared, if necessary, to repeat this to the Board?”","“如果有必要，你是否准备把这件事向董事会再说一遍？”"
"The young man pressed his hands together.","年轻人把双手紧紧地握在一起。"
"“Well, sir, I’d much rather have held my tongue; but if you decide it’s got to be taken up, I suppose I must go through with it now.","“哦，先生，我倒宁愿保持沉默，但如果您决定必须这么做的话，我想我一定会奉陪到底。"
"I’m sure I hope you’ll decide to leave it alone; perhaps it isn’t true—only why didn’t Mr. Elderson say: ‘You ruddy liar!’?”","我是真的希望您会决定要不要管它，或许这件事不是真的——只是为什么埃尔德森先生不说：‘你这个大骗子！呢？’”"
"Exactly!","的确如此！"
"Why didn’t he?","他为什么不说呢？"
"Soames gave a grunt of intense discomfort.","索姆斯非常不安地咕哝了一声。"
"“Anything more?” he said.","“还有别的吗？”他说。"
"“No, sir.”","“没有了，先生。”"
"“Very well.","“很好。"
"You’ve not told anyone?”","你没有告诉过别人吧？”"
"“No, sir.”","“没有，先生。”"
"“Then don’t, and leave it to me.”","“那就不要告诉别人，让我来处理吧。”"
"“I’ll be only too happy to, sir.","“那我真的太高兴了，先生。"
"Good-morning!”","祝您日安！”"
"“Good-morning!”","“你也一样！”"
"No—very bad morning!","不安——非常不安！"
"No satisfaction whatever in this sudden fulfilment of his prophetic feeling about Elderson.","虽然他对埃尔德森的预感突然得到了证实，但是他一点儿也不感到满意。"
"None!","一点也不！"
"“What d’you think of that young fellow, Gradman?","“你觉得那个小伙子怎么样，格雷德曼？"
"Is he lying?”","他在撒谎吗？”"
"Thus summoned, as it were, from stupor, Gradman thoughtfully rubbed a nose both thick and shining.","格雷德曼仿佛从昏迷中被唤醒了一样，沉思着擦了擦他那只又大又亮的鼻子。"
"“It’s one word against another, Mr. Soames, unless you get more evidence.","“这只是一面之词，索姆斯先生，除非您能找到更多的证据。"
"But I can’t see what the young man has to gain by it.”","但是我看不出这个年轻人这样做能得到什么好处。”"
"“Nor I; but you never know.","“我也看不出，但是世事难料。"
"The trouble will be to get more evidence.","问题就在于要找到更多的证据。"
"Can I act without it?”","没有证据我能采取行动吗？”"
"“It’s delicate,” said Gradman.","“这件事很微妙。”格雷德曼说。"
"And Soames knew that he was thrown back on himself.","索姆斯知道他只能依靠自己了。"
"When Gradman said a thing was delicate, it meant that it was the sort of matter on which he was accustomed to wait for orders—presumptuous even to hold opinion!","当格雷德曼说一件事情很微妙的时候，就意味着对于这类事情他向来是惟命是从的——就连有想法都是很冒昧的！"
"But had he got one?","但是他有没有想法呢？"
"Well, one would never know!","哦，没有人会知道！"
"The old chap would sit and rub his nose over it till Kingdom Come.","这个老家伙会一直坐在那里对着这件事擦鼻子，直到上西天。"
"“I shan’t act in a hurry,” he said, almost angrily: “I can’t see to the end of this.”","“我不能贸然行事，”他几乎生气地说，“我还没有摸透这件事。”"
"Every hour confirmed that statement.","那句话每时每刻都在得到证实。"
"At lunch the tape of his city club showed the mark still falling—to unheard-of depths!","午餐时，城市俱乐部的行情收录带上显示马克仍然在贬值——跌到了一种闻所未闻的程度！"
"How they could talk of golf, with this business on his mind, he could not imagine!","心里装着这件事，他简直无法想象他们怎么还能谈论高尔夫球！"
"“I must go and see that fellow,” he said to himself.","“我要去见见那个家伙，”他自言自语道，"
"“I shall be guarded.","“我要保持警惕。"
"He may throw some light.”","或许他会露出一些破绽。”"
"He waited until three o’clock and repaired to the P. P. R. S. ","一直等到3点钟，他才到天佑再保险公司去。"
"Reaching the office, he sought the Board room.","一到公司，他就找到董事会会议室。"
"The chairman was there in conference with the manager.","董事长正在那里和经理开会。"
"Soames sat down quietly to listen; and while he listened he watched that fellow’s face.","索姆斯静静地坐下来听着，一边听一边注视着那家伙的脸。"
"It told him nothing.","从他脸上看不出什么。"
"What nonsense people talked when they said you could tell character from faces!","有人说你能从脸上看出人的性格，这简直是胡说八道！"
"Only a perfect idiot’s face could be read like that.","只有纯粹的白痴才能让人从脸上看出来。"
"And here was a man of experience and culture, one who knew every rope of business life and polite society.","而眼下这个人却是一个有经验有文化的人，他熟悉商业生活和上流社会的一切规则。"
"The hairless, neat features exhibited no more concern than the natural mortification of one whose policy had met with such a nasty knock.","他那光秃秃的头顶和整洁的面容所表现出来的忧虑，只不过是一个经营方针遭到了严重打击的人自然而然的窘迫感而已。"
"The drop of the mark had already wiped out any possible profit on the next half-year.","马克贬值已经彻底抵消了下半年所有潜在的利润。"
"Unless the wretched thing recovered, they would be carrying a practically dead load of German insurance.","除非那该死的东西能恢复原状，否则他们就会背上一笔名存实亡的德国保险。"
"Really it was criminal that no limit of liability had been fixed!","之前竟没有确定责任限额，这真是犯罪！"
"How on earth could he ever have overlooked that when he came on the Board?","他加入董事会的时候怎么会忽略了这一点呢？"
"But he had only known of it afterwards.","但是他也是后来才知道这件事的。"
"And who could have foreseen anything so mad as this Ruhr business, or realised the slack confidence of his colleagues in this confounded fellow?","而且谁能预见到像鲁尔事件这么疯狂的事情呢，谁又能意识到他的同事们会对这个糊涂的家伙盲目信任呢？"
"The words “gross negligence” appeared ‘close up’ before his eyes.","“严重失职”这几个字像“特写镜头”一样浮现在他的眼前。"
"What if an action lay against the Board!","假如有人控告董事会怎么办！"
"Gross negligence!","严重失职！"
"At his age and with his reputation!","以他的年龄，凭他的声望！"
"Why!","唉！"
"The thing was plain as a pikestaff; for omitting a limit of liability this chap had got his commission!","这件事再明显不过了，由于忽略了责任限额，那家伙才拿到了他的佣金！"
"Ten per cent, probably, on all that business—he must have netted thousands!","可能有10%，在整个那笔生意上——他一定已经净赚了几千镑！"
"A man must be in Queer Street indeed to take a risk like that!","一个敢于冒那样风险的人，一定是走投无路了！"
"But conscious that his fancy was running on, Soames rose, and turned his back.","索姆斯意识到自己的想象没完没了，于是他站了起来，转过身去。"
"The action suggested another.","这个动作使他想到了另一个动作。"
"Simulate anger, draw some sign from that fellow’s self-control!","假装生气，从那个家伙的自我控制中找出一些迹象！"
"He turned again, and said pettishly: “What on earth were you about, Mr. Manager, when you allowed these contracts to go through without limit of liability?","他又回过身来，怒气冲冲地说：“你到底是怎么搞的，经理先生，没有制定责任限额就通过了这些合同？"
"A man of your experience!","像你这么有经验的人，居然干出这种事！"
"What was your motive?”","你的动机是什么？”"
"A slight narrowing of the eyes, a slight compression of the lips.","那家伙眼睛稍稍一眯，嘴唇微微一抿。"
"He had relied on the word ‘motive,’ but the fellow passed it by.","他原指望“动机”这个词会起作用，但那个家伙却把它避开了。"
"“For such high premiums as we have been getting, Mr. Forsyte, a limited liability was not possible.","“对于我们一直以来收取的如此高的保险费而言，福赛特先生，要设定责任限额是不太可能的。"
"This is a most outrageous development, and I’m afraid it must be considered just bad luck.”","这是十分异常的发展情况，恐怕只能把它归结于坏运气。”"
"“Unfortunately,” said Soames, “there’s no such thing as luck in properly regulated assurance, as we shall find, or I’m much mistaken.","“不幸的是，”索姆斯说，“我们将会发现，在管理得当的保险业中是不存在运气这类东西的，否则就是我大错特错了。"
"I shouldn’t be surprised if an action lay against the Board for gross negligence!”","如果有人控告董事会严重失职，我一点儿也不感到意外！”"
"That had got the chairman’s goat!—Got his goat?","这下倒把董事长惹怒了！——把他惹怒了？"
"What expressions they used nowadays!","如今他们用的都是些什么词啊！"
"Or did it mean the opposite?","或者这是正话反说？"
"One never knew!","谁知道呢！"
"But as for Elderson—he seemed to Soames to be merely counterfeiting a certain flusteration.","但是至于埃尔德森——在索姆斯看来，他只是在假装一副紧张不安的样子。"
"Futile to attempt to spring anything out of a chap like that.","试图从他那样的家伙身上套出些什么来，是白费劲了。"
"If the thing were true, the fellow must be entirely desperate, prepared for anything and everything.","如果这件事是真的，那个家伙一定彻底绝望了，肯定会铤而走险。"
"And since from Soames the desperate side of life—the real holes, the impossible positions which demand a gambler’s throw—had always been carefully barred by the habits of a prudent nature, he found it now impossible to imagine Elderson’s state of mind, or his line of conduct if he were guilty.","由于对索姆斯来说，人生绝望的一面——那些迫使赌徒孤注一掷的真实的困境和难以忍受的境地——一直都被他那谨慎的天性小心翼翼地隔绝了，如果埃尔德森有罪的话，他现在简直无法想象他的心理状态和行为方式会是什么样子。"
"For all he could tell, the chap might be carrying poison about with him; might be sitting on a revolver like a fellow on the film.","因为他现在能感觉到的是，那家伙可能随身带着毒药，也可能像电影里的人一样，屁股下坐着一把左轮手枪。"
"The whole thing was too unpleasant, too worrying for words.","整个这件事太让人不悦，太让人焦虑了，非言语所能表达。"
"And without saying any more he went away, taking nothing with him but the knowledge that their total liability on this German business, with the mark valueless, was over two hundred thousand pounds.","于是，他没有再说什么就离开了，他没有带走任何东西，只是得知了一条消息，由于马克变得一文不值，他们在德国业务上的负债总计超过20万英镑。"
"He hastily reviewed the fortunes of his co-directors.","他匆匆地估算了一下那些和他共事的董事们的财产。"
"Old Fontenoy was always in low water; the chairman a dark horse; Mont was in land, land right down in value, and mortgaged at that; old Cosey Mothergill had nothing but his name and his director’s fees; Meyricke must have a large income, but light come, light go, like most of those big counsel with irons in many fires and the certainty of a judgeship.","老福坦诺向来手头拮据；董事长的财产难以猜测；蒙特的财产是地皮，地皮正在贬值，并且都抵押出去了；老柯赛·莫德吉尔除了他的虚名和董事酬劳金外一无所有；迈里克一定有一大笔收入，但是来得快，去得也快，就像大多数的那些大律师，业务繁忙，而且肯定能当上法官。"
"Not a really substantial man among the lot, except himself!","这些人之中，除了他自己，没有一个是真正富裕的人！"
"He ploughed his way along, head down.","他低着头，脚步沉重地向前走着。"
"Public companies!","上市公司！"
"Preposterous system!","荒谬的制度！"
"You had to trust somebody, and there you were!","你不得不信任某一个人，然后你就落到了今天的境地！"
"It was appalling!","这可真可怕！"
"“Balloons, sir—beautiful colours, five feet circumference.","“气球，先生——漂亮的颜色，可以吹出五英尺的周长。"
"Take one, gentleman!”","买一个吧，先生！”"
"“Good gad!” said Soames.","“上帝啊！”索姆斯说。"
"As if the pricked bubble of German business were not enough!","好像戳破了德国业务的气泡还不够似的！"

"Chapter II","第二章"
"Victorine","维多琳"
"All through December balloons had been slack—hardly any movement about them, even in Christmas week, and from the Bickets Central Australia was as far as ever.","进入十二月以来，气球生意一直萧条——即使在圣诞节的那一周，生意也没什么起色。对于比克特夫妇来说，移居澳大利亚中部的梦想还是那么遥不可及。"
"The girl Victorine, restored to comparative health, had not regained her position in the blouse department of Messrs.Boney Blayds & Co.","维多琳的身体已经恢复得差不多了，但还是没有如期到博尼·布莱兹公司的女衬衣部报到。"
"They had given her some odd sewing, but not of late, and she had spent much time trying to get work less uncertain.","他们给过她一些琐碎的针线活，但是最近没有什么零活。她花了很长时间，就是想要找一份相对稳定的工作。"
"Her trouble was—had always been—her face.","她的问题出在——一直出在——她的脸上。"
"It was unusual.","她的脸与众不同。"
"People did not know what to make of a girl who looked like that.","人们不知道是什么使一个女孩出落成这样的。"
"Why employ one who without qualification of wealth, rank, fashion, or ability (so far as they knew) made them feel ordinary?","为什么非要雇佣一个没有财富、地位和品味，还缺乏能力（在他们看来），但又使他们相形见绌的员工呢？"
"For—however essential to such as Fleur and Michael—dramatic interest was not primary in the manufacture or sale of blouses, in the fitting-on of shoes, the addressing of envelopes, making-up of funeral wreaths, or the other ambitions of Victorine.","因为在制作或销售衬衣时，在试穿皮鞋时，在填写信封时，在做殡仪的花圈时，或者是在维多琳感兴趣的其他行当中，兴趣爱好不是她首要考虑的——尽管它对于弗勒和迈克尔那类人是不可或缺的。"
"Behind those large dark eyes and silent lips, what went on?","在那双黑黑的大眼睛和沉默的双唇后面，究竟发生过什么事情呢？"
"It worried Boney Blayds & Co., and the more wholesale firms of commerce.","这一切使博尼·布莱兹公司和更多的商业批发公司感到一丝不安。"
"The lurid professions—film-super, or mannequin—did not occur to one, of self-deprecating nature, born in Putney.","但是对于出生在帕特尼镇而且生来自卑的维多琳来说，像那种需要浓妆艳抹的职业——例如电影演员或者服装模特——都是从来没有想过的。"
"When Bicket had gone out of a morning with his tray and his balloons not yet blown up, she would stand biting her finger, as though to gnaw her way to some escape from this hand-to-mouth existence which kept her husband thin as a rail, tired as a rook, shabby as a tailless sparrow, and, at the expense of all caste feeling, brought them in no more than just enough to keep them living under a roof.","每天早晨，当比克特带着托盘和那些还没充气的气球离开家时，她就会站在那里一直咬着自己的手指，似乎要咬出一条摆脱这贫困生活的出路。贫困生活已经使她的丈夫骨瘦如柴，累得像只白嘴鸦，寒酸得像只秃尾巴的麻雀，而且，就算以丢掉自己社会地位为代价，也只能勉强不流落街头而已。"
"It had long been clear to them both that there was no future in balloons, just a cadging present.","他们两个人心里早就明白，气球只不过是一件贩卖的礼物，靠它是没有前途的。"
"And there smouldered in the silent, passive Victorine a fierce resentment.","所以维多琳沉默地压抑着，消极地积聚着一股愤恨之情。"
"She wanted better things for herself, for him, chiefly for him.","她要为自己，为他，主要是为他，争取更好的生活。"
"On the morning when the mark was bumping down, she was putting on her velveteen jacket and toque (best remaining items of her wardrobe), having taken a resolve.","在马克惨跌的那个清晨，她穿上短款棉绒上衣，戴上那顶小圆帽（这两件可是她衣橱里剩下的最好的东西了），心里已经做了决定。"
"Bicket never mentioned his old job, and his wife had subtly divined some cause beyond the ordinary for his loss of it.","比克特对之前那份工作只字未提，但是她已经能敏感地猜测到，他失业可能另有隐情。"
"Why not see if she could get him taken back?","为什么不再尝试一下呢，也许她能让比克特复职？"
"He had often said: “Mr. Mont’s a gent and a sort o’ socialist; been through the war, too; no high-and-mighty about HIM.”","他总是说：“蒙特先生可是个好人，是社会主义者那种类型的，还参加过大战，一点儿架子也没有，平易近人。”"
"If she could ‘get at’ this phenomenon!","要是她能和这位非凡人物“交流”就好了！"
"With the flush of hope and daring in her sallow cheeks, she took stock of her appearance from the window-glasses of the Strand.","蜡黄的脸上涌起了希望和勇敢带来的红晕，她不禁在斯特兰德大街的橱窗玻璃中打量着自己。"
"Her velveteen of jade-green always pleased one who had an eye for colour, but her black skirt—well, perhaps the wear and tear of it wouldn’t show if she kept behind the counter.","喜欢色彩艳丽的人总是喜欢她那件翠绿色的短棉绒上衣，但是她的黑裙子嘛——嗯，假如她站在柜台后面的话，就不会看出它的破旧了。"
"Had she brass enough to say that she came about a manuscript?","她有足够的胆量和勇气说她是因为书稿来的吗？"
"And she rehearsed with silent lips, pinching her accent: “Would you ask Mr. Mont, please, if I could see him; it’s about a manuscript.”","于是她默默地演练了一番，尽力保持着那种腔调：“因为稿子的事，我想见蒙特先生，麻烦您通知一下。”"
"Yes! and then would come the question: “What name, please?”","对了！可能接待人会发问：“请问您贵姓？”"
"“Mrs. Bicket?”","“比克特夫人？”"
"Never!","不能这么说！"
"“Miss Victorine Collins?”","“维多琳·柯林斯小姐？”"
"All authoresses had maiden names.","所有的女作家应该都用自己的闺名吧。"
"Victorine—yes!","对——就说维多琳！"
"But Collins!","但是柯林斯呢！"
"It didn’t sound like.","听上去不太像。"
"And no one would know what her maiden name had been.","也没人知道她的闺名叫什么。"
"Why not choose one?","为什么不选个其他名字呢？"
"They often chose.","人们通常都这么干。"
"And she searched.","于是她思考起来。"
"Something Italian, like—like—Hadn’t their landlady said to them when they came in: “Is your wife Eyetalian?”","意大利式的名字，就像——就像——他们刚搬进来时，女房东不是就曾经问他们：“您妻子是意大利人吗？”"
"Ah!","啊！"
"Manuelli!","曼纽莉！"
"That was certainly Italian—the ice-cream man in Little Ditch Street had it!","这绝对是个纯正的意大利名字——那个在小沟街上卖冰激凌的小贩就叫这个名字。"
"She walked on practising beneath her breath.","她边走边小声练习着。"
"If only she could get to see this Mr. Mont!","只要能见到蒙特先生！"
"She entered, trembling.","她哆嗦着走了进去。"

"If physically Fleur stood up straight, was she morally as erect?","假如弗勒身体站得笔直，那她在道德上又是否同样正直呢？"
"This was the speculation for which he continually called himself a cad.","这种想法一出现，总是让他觉得自己很龌龊。"
"He saw no change in her movements, and loyally refrained from enquiring into the movements he could not see.","他丝毫看不出弗勒有什么改变，同时他在极力避免自己去追问那些他不知道的事情。"
"But his aroused attention made him more and more aware of a certain cynicism, as if she were continually registering the belief that all values were equal and none of much value.","但是他那被激发的注意力愈发使他感觉到某种不屑一顾的态度，好像它已成了弗勒一贯信奉的信仰——所有价值观都是平等的，也没有什么价值观是有价值的。"
"Wilfrid, though still in London, was neither visible nor spoken of.","虽然威尔弗里德还在伦敦，但是看不见他的人影，大家也不提他。"
"“Out of sight and hearing, out of mind,” seemed to be the motto.","“眼不见，耳不闻，心不烦。”好像已经成为了至理名言。"
"It did not work with Michael—Wilfrid was constantly in his mind.","但是这句至理名言对迈克尔丝毫不起作用——他的心中总是有威尔弗里德的影子。"
"If Wilfrid were not seeing Fleur, how could he bear to stay within such tantalising reach of her?","假如威尔弗里德见不到弗勒，那他怎么能忍受那种可望而不可即的痛苦？"
"If Fleur did not want Wilfrid to stay, why had she not sent him away?","假如弗勒不想让威尔弗里德留下，那么为什么不打发他走呢？"
"He was finding it difficult, too, to conceal from others the fact that Desert and he were no longer pals.","如果对旁人隐瞒自己和德赛特已经不是好友了，他觉得也很难。"
"Often the impetus to go and have it out with him surged up and was beaten back.","好几次他都冲动地想找他说个清楚，但都克制住了。"
"Either there was nothing beyond what he already knew, or there was something—and Wilfrid would say there wasn’t.","可能确实没有什么他不知道的事情，也可能是有事情——并且威尔弗里德还是会说没有。"
"Michael accepted that without cavil; one did not give a woman away!","迈克尔无可奈何，一个男人是不会把自己的女人拱手相让的！"
"But he wanted to hear no lies from a War comrade.","但他想从一起打过仗的战友那里打听实情。"
"Between Fleur and himself no word had passed; for words, he felt, would add no knowledge, merely imperil a hold weak enough already.","弗勒和他之间没有发生过口角，他觉得吵架并不会加深对事情的了解，反而使原本脆弱的关系变得更糟。"
"Christmas at the ancestral manor of the Monts had been passed in covert-shooting.","圣诞节是在蒙特家祖传的庄园里度过的，人们在那里进行丛林打猎。"
"Fleur had come and stood with him at the last drive on the second day, holding Ting-a-ling on a lead.","第二天最后一次驱车外出打猎时，弗勒来了，站在他身旁，手里牵着小叮铃。"
"The Chinese dog had been extraordinarily excited, climbing the air every time a bird fell, and quite unaffected by the noise of guns.","这只中国犬特别兴奋，每次有鸟被打落时，它总是一跃而起，丝毫不受枪声的干扰。"
"Michael, waiting to miss his birds—he was a poor shot—had watched her eager face emerging from grey fur, her form braced back against Ting-a-ling.","迈克尔一边等待着他的猎物——他的技术不怎样——一边看着她那露在灰色皮毛领子外的充满渴望的脸颊。她的身子朝后倾，使劲拉着小叮铃。"
"Shooting was new to her; and under the stimulus of novelty she was always at her best.","打猎对她来说可是件新鲜事，而每当有新鲜刺激的事情时，她总是处在最佳的精神状态。"
"He had loved even her “Oh, Michaels!” when he missed.","当他没打中时，就连她的“哎呀，迈克尔，迈克尔！”他都愿意听。"
"She had been the success of the gathering, which meant seeing almost nothing of her except a sleepy head on a pillow; but, at least, down there he had not suffered from lurking uneasiness.","她是这次聚会的成功之处，除了晚上看见她头枕枕头香甜地睡着，白天几乎看不到她的人影。不过，至少在那里，他感觉不到潜在的痛苦。"
"Putting a last touch to the bobbed hair on the blotting paper, he got up.","他在吸水画纸上给短发加了最后一笔之后，就站了起来。"
"St. Paul’s, that girl had said.","那位女子说过，圣保罗大教堂。"
"He might stroll up and have a squint at Bicket.","他可以散步到那里，去看看比克特。"
"Something might occur to him.","他可能想起了什么。"
"Tightening the belt of his blue overcoat round his waist, he sallied forth, thin and sprightly, with a little ache in his heart.","他系好蓝色大衣的腰带，看起来很精干。然后，他带着一丝忐忑动身了。"
"Walking east, on that bright, cheerful day, nothing struck him so much as the fact that he was alive, well, and in work.","天气晴朗宜人，他朝东走去，心中竟涌起从未有过的感慨，感慨如今自己活着，活得还很好，并且拥有一份不错的工作。"
"So very many were dead, ill, or out of a job.","而有那么多的人已经离世、生病，或失业。"
"He entered Covent Garden.","他走进了科芬园。"
"Amazing place!","这是个令人惊异的地方！"
"A human nature which, decade after decade, could put up with Covent Garden was not in danger of extinction from its many ills.","尽管人性有许多弱点，人们数十年以来对科芬园的喜爱却没有濒临灭绝的危险。"
"A comforting place—one needn’t take anything too seriously after walking through it.","这是一个给人慰藉的地方——人们但凡在这里走上一圈，就会对世间万事看淡许多。"
"On this square island were the vegetables of the earth and the fruits of the world, bounded on the west by publishing, on the cast by opera, on the north and south by rivers of mankind.","广场西起出版社，东至歌剧院，南北两则是川流不息的人群。这里汇集了来自世界各地的蔬菜和水果。"
"Among discharging carts and litter of paper, straw and men out of drawing, Michael walked and sniffed.","迈克尔行走在卸货的大车、乱丢的纸屑和麦秆中，走在和周围景致不相协调的人群中间，边走边嗅闻着。"
"Smell of its own, Covent Garden, earthy and just not rotten!","科芬园有股特殊的泥土气味，但又不是泥土腐烂的气味！"
"He had never seen—even in the War—any place that so utterly lacked form.","即使是在大战中，他也从未见过如此凌乱不堪的地方。"
"Extraordinarily English!","非凡的英国人！"
"Nobody looked as if they had anything to do with the soil—drivers, hangers-on, packers, and the salesmen inside the covered markets, seemed equally devoid of acquaintanceship with sun, wind, water, earth or air—town types all!","似乎没人关心这片土壤——赶车的、不务正业的、打包工，还有在遮蔽的货摊里的小贩们——他们也跟阳光、风、水、大地，或者空气——跟这里的一切都毫不相干！"
"And—Golly!—how their faces jutted, sloped, sagged and swelled, in every kind of featural disharmony.","而且——上帝！——他们的脸怪模怪样、形态各异——向前伸着的、歪向一边的、下垂的、肿胀的。"
"What was the English type amongst all this infinite variety of disproportion?","在这么多不正常的模样中，哪一类才算是典型的英国脸呢？"
"There just wasn’t one!","一个也没有！"
"He came on the fruits, glowing piles, still and bright—foreigners from the land of the sun—globes all the same size and colour.","他来到水果摊前，一堆堆色彩鲜艳、表面光亮的水果静静地摆在那里——来自阳光充足地方的进口货——堆成了同样大小、同样颜色的圆圈。"
"They made Michael’s mouth water.","这些水果令迈克尔垂涎三尺。"
"‘Something in the sun,’ he thought; ‘there really is.’","“那才是真正产自阳光充足地方的水果。”他心想。"
"Look at Italy, at the Arabs, at Australia—the Australians came from England, and see the type now!","看看意大利、阿拉伯、澳大利亚——澳大利亚人来自英格兰，看看现在他们的模样！"
"Nevertheless—a Cockney for good temper!","不过——伦敦佬脾气好！"
"The more regular a person’s form and features, the more selfish they were!","一个人的体型和外貌越匀称正常，这个人越自私！"
"Those grape-fruit looked horribly self-satisfied, compared with the potatoes!","与土豆相比，那些葡萄柚就自负得多！"
"He emerged still thinking about the English.","他走出广场，脑子里还在想着英国人。"
"Well!","对！"
"They were now one of the plainest and most distorted races of the world; and yet was there any race to compare with them for good temper and for ‘guts’?","现在的英国人是世界上最平庸、最畸形的民族了，可是还有哪个民族能跟他们较量脾气和“厚颜无耻”呢？"
"And they needed those in their smoky towns, and their climate—remarkable instance of adaptation to environment, the modern English character!","但是对于他们而言，在那烟雾弥漫和多变的气候环境中，恰恰需要这种性格——适应环境，现代英国性格的一个典型例子！"
"‘I could pick out an Englishman anywhere,’ he thought, ‘and yet, physically, there’s no general type now!’","“我可以在任何一个地方认出英国人，”他心想，“但是，从外表体征上来讲，现在可没有一个通用类型了！”"
"Astounding people!","令人震惊的民族！"
"So ugly in the mass, yet growing such flowers of beauty, and such strange sprigs—like that little Mrs. Bicket; so unimaginative in bulk, yet with such a blooming lot of poets!","整体看是那么丑陋，却能培养出绝世美人，还有一群与众不同的佳人——就像小巧玲珑的比克特夫人那样；即使大多数人缺乏想象力，但是还是有着数不胜数的诗人才子！"
"How would old Danby like it, by the way, when Wilfrid took his next volume to some other firm; or rather what should he—Wilfrid’s particular friend!—say to old Danby?","顺便提一下，威尔弗里德把自己下一卷诗作拿给其他出版社时，不知老丹比会有何感想？换言之，他——这位威尔弗里德的特殊朋友——该如何向老丹比开口？"
"Aha!","啊哈！"
"He knew what he should say:","他知道他应该这么说："
"“Yes, sir, but you should have let that poor blighter off who snooped the ‘Copper Coins.’","“对了，先生，您应该宽恕那个偷了《铜币》的年轻人。"
"Desert hasn’t forgotten your refusal.”","德赛特可一直记着您拒绝了他。”"
"One for old Danby and his eternal inthe-rightness!","这是对老丹比和他那永远认为自己正确的想法的有力回击！"
"‘Copper Coin’ had done uncommonly well.","《铜币》销路很好。"
"Its successor would probably do uncommonly better.","接下来的书可能销路会更好。"
"The book was a proof of what he—Michael—was always saying: The ‘cockyolly-bird period’ was passing.","这本书就印证了他——迈克尔——一直说的话：“雏鸟时期”已经过去。"
"People wanted life again.","人们重新寻找生活的真谛。"
"Sibley, Walter Nazing, Linda—all those who had nothing to say except that they were superior to such as had—were already measured for their coffins.","西布莉、沃尔特·内津、琳达——只会自视清高却言之无物的人们——已经是气息奄奄了。"
"Not that they would know when they were in them; not blooming likely!","这并不意味着他们躺在棺材里的时候会明白这一切，这根本是不可能的！"
"They would continue to wave their noses and look down them!","他们会继续得意忘形，看不起那些人！"
"‘I’M fed-up with them,’ thought Michael.","“我十分厌恶他们，”迈克尔心想，"
"‘If only Fleur would see that looking down your nose is a sure sign of inferiority!’","“要是弗勒能明白看不起别人是自卑的表现，那该多好！”"
"And, suddenly, it came to him that she probably did.","于是，他突然想到，可能她已经明白了。"
"Wilfrid was the only one of the whole lot she had ever been thick with; the others were there because—well, because she was Fleur, and had the latest things about her.","在弗勒曾经密切交往的一群人中，威尔弗里德只是其中的一个。其他的人与她交往一则是因为——嗯，因为她是弗勒，还有就是弗勒身边总是汇集着时髦的事情。"
"When, very soon, they were no longer the latest things, she would drop them.","不久之后，当他们不再时髦时，弗勒自然而然就会抛弃他们。"
"But Wilfrid she would not drop.","但是她绝不会抛弃威尔弗里德的。"
"No, he felt sure that she had not dropped, and would not drop Wilfrid.","不，他肯定弗勒绝没有抛弃而且也绝不会放弃威尔弗里德的。"
"He looked up.","他抬头看看。"
"Ludgate Hill!","来到了拉德盖特山街！"
"“Near St. Paul’s—sells balloons?”","“在圣保罗大教堂附近——卖气球？”"
"And there—sure enough—the poor beggar was!","在那里——果然是他——那个可怜的家伙！"
"Bicket was deflating with a view to going off his stand for a cup of cocoa.","比克特为了到别处去喝一杯可可，正在把气球里的空气放掉。"
"Remembering that he had come on him by accident, Michael stood for a moment preparing the tones of surprise.","迈克尔想到他要装作偶然遇见，就故意站了一会儿，准备装出诧异的口气。"
"Pity the poor chap couldn’t blow himself into one of those coloured shapes and float over St. Paul’s to Peter.","令人遗憾的是，这个可怜的家伙不可能把自己吹到一个五颜六色的气球里，使他从圣保罗大教堂的上空一直飞到彼得那里去。"
"Mournful little cuss he looked, squeezing out the air!","他看上去的确像一只可怜虫，使劲地把气球里的空气挤出去。"
"Memory tapped sharply on his mind.","回忆强烈地涌上他的心头。"
"Balloon—in the square—November the first—joyful night!","气球——在广场上——11月1号——令人愉快的夜晚！"
"Special!","特别的！"
"Fleur!","弗勒！"
"Perhaps they brought luck.","也许它们带来了好运。"
"He moved and said in an astounded voice: “YOU, Bicket?","他走过去，用吃惊的语气说：“比克特，是你吗？"
"Is this your stunt now?”","你现在做这个生意吗？”"
"The large eyes of Bicket regarded him over a puce-coloured sixpennyworth.","比克特瞪着那双大眼睛，将目光从一个价值六便士的深褐色气球转移到他身上。"
"“Mr. Mont!","“蒙特先生！"
"Often thought I’d like to see you again, sir.”","我经常想着再能遇见您，先生。”"
"“Same here, Bicket.","“我也是啊，比克特。"
"If you’re not doing anything, come and have some lunch.”","你现在没什么生意的话，咱俩一起吃午饭吧。”"
"Bicket completed the globe’s collapse, and, closing his tray-lid, said: “Reelly, sir?”","比克特弄瘪了那个气球，随手关上了托盘的盖子，说道：“您说的是真的吗，先生？”"
"“Rather!","“当然啦！"

"At a small table decorated with white oilcloth and a cruet stand, Michael sat down.","迈克尔坐在了一张铺着白色油布和放着调味瓶架的小桌旁。"

"Hurry up, please.”","麻烦快一些。”"
"When the white-aproned fellow had gone about it, Bicket said simply:","当系着白围裙的服务员拿着菜单去准备的时候，比克特迟钝地说了句："
"“My Gawd!”","“我的上帝啊！”"
"“Yes, it’s a funny world, Bicket.”","“是啊，比克特，这是个可笑的世界。”"
"“It is, and that’s a fact.","“是啊，是这样。"

"I eat my conscience every day.”","我每天都在泯灭自己的良心。”"
"Bicket shook his head.","比克特摇摇头。"
"“No, sir, if you’ve got money, spend it.","“不是的，先生，如果您有钱，那就花吧。"

"Then getting on a ‘bus, he was borne back past St. Paul’s.","接着他坐上了公共汽车，车往回开，路过了圣保罗大教堂。"

"How tired he was of cleverness!","他是多么厌恶这种娴熟！"
"Sometimes he would take a manuscript home to Fleur for her opinion.","有时他会给弗勒带一份原稿，征求一下她的意见。"
"He remembered her saying once: “This is exactly like life, Michael, it just rushes—it doesn’t dwell on anything long enough to mean anything anywhere.","他记得有一次她曾说过：“迈克尔，这跟生活一模一样，急速行进——不会为了表明什么而在任何地方、在任何事情上喋喋不休地做过久的停留。"
"Of course the author didn’t mean it for satire, but if you publish it, I advise you to put: ‘This awful satire on modern life’ outside the cover.”","当然，作者并不打算把它写成讽刺作品，但是如果你要出版，我建议你在封面上写下一句话：‘此书是对现代生活的强烈讽刺。’”"
"And they had.","他们这样做了。"
"At least, they had put: “This wonderful satire on modern life.”","至少他们写了一句话：“此书是对现代生活的绝妙讽刺。”"
"Fleur WAS like that!","弗勒就像这样！"
"She could see the hurry, but, like the author of the wonderful satire, she didn’t know that she herself veered and hurried, or—did she know?","她知道自己闲不住，但就像那部绝妙讽刺作品的作者一样，她丝毫不知道自己正在追逐着、忙碌着，又或者——她已经知道了？"
"Was she conscious of kicking at life, like a flame at air?","她是否意识到自己正在生活中冲撞，就像空气中的火焰一样？"

"Fleur used—but he could catch no scent, except incense.","是弗勒用过的味道，但是他闻不到香水味，只是闻到了燃香的味道。"
"Winifred burnt joss-sticks when she remembered what a distinguished atmosphere they produced.","威妮弗雷德燃起线香，通常是因为她想起线香会制造出一种高雅气氛。"
"“What name?”","“您贵姓啊？”"

"Committed, however, he followed the maid.","既然已经通报了，不管怎样，他都得跟着女仆进去了。"

"Michael said: “I don’t know,” and dropped on to a settee beside Mrs. Val.","迈克尔说：“我不太清楚。”说完便坐在瓦尔夫人旁边的长靠椅上。"
"Ignorant of the Forsyte family feud, he was unable to appreciate the relief he had brought in with him.","由于他之前丝毫不知道福赛特家族长期的矛盾，所以也根本不清楚因为自己的到来而使得气氛有所缓和。"
"Soames said something about the French, got up, and went to the window; Winifred joined him—their voices sounded confidential.","索姆斯说了一些关于法国人的事，就起身朝窗边走去；威妮弗雷德也跟着过去——他们说话声音很小，似乎很神秘。"

"“What was that?”","“是什么事呢？”"
"“Well, I notice that any one at all out of proportion, or whose nose is on one side, or whose eyes jut out, or even have a special shining look, always believes in the soul; people who are in proportion, and have no prominent physical features, don’t seem to be really interested.”","“嗯，我注意到，任何一个五官不端正的人，要么鼻子歪的，要么眼睛突出的，要么样子与众不同的人，他们总是相信灵魂；而那些五官端正、外貌没有明显缺陷的人，似乎就不关心他们的灵魂。”"

"I’m not—and I certainly do.","而我长得不好看——所以我忧心忡忡。"
"The people in Covent Garden must have lots of soul.","那些在科芬园的人一定有很多灵魂。"
"You think ‘the soul’s’ the result of loose-gearing in the organism—sort of special consciousness from not working in one piece.”","您想‘灵魂’是生物体连接松散的结果——一种因为不能进行整体活动而产生的特殊感觉。”"

"It really is an idea, only, of course, most people see it the other way.","这的确是一种说法，只不过，当然了，大多数人不这样认为。"
"They’d say the soul produces the disproportion, makes the eyes shine, bends the nose, and all that; where the soul is small, it’s not trying to get out of the body, whence the barber’s block.","他们可能会说，灵魂导致了五官不端正——眼睛发亮、鼻子弯曲以及等等一系列说法。如果一个人的灵魂渺小，它是不会妄图摆脱肉体的，那些理发师的头型由此而来。"
"I’ll think about it.","我要思考一下这个问题。"

"Chapter IV","第四章"
"Fleur’s Body","弗勒的肉体"
"Fleur’s body, indeed, was at the moment in one of those difficult positions which continually threaten the spirit of compromise.","的确，此刻弗勒的肉体处境很困难，这困难的处境正在不断地威胁着她妥协的内心。"
"It was in fact in Wilfrid’s arms; sufficiently, at least, to make her say:","此时，她正在威尔弗里德的怀抱中。至少，这一举动足以让她说："
"“No, Wilfrid—you promised to be good.”","“别这样，威尔弗里德——你答应过我会守规矩的。”"
"It was a really remarkable tribute to her powers of skating on thin ice that the word ‘good’ should still have significance.","“守规矩”一词现在竟然还有意义，她如履薄冰的本事确实令人佩服。"
"For eleven weeks exactly this young man had danced on the edge of fulfilment, and was even now divided from her by two clenched hands pressed firmly against his chest, and the word ‘good’; and this after not having seen her for a fortnight.","整整11周了，这个年轻人一直在欲望的边缘垂死挣扎。即使是现在，弗勒仍然握紧双手挡在他的胸前，还让他“守规矩”，可是他已经两周没见到她了。"
"When she said it, he let her go, with a sort of violence, and sat down on a piece of junk.","她说完这句话后，他就放开了她，一副凶神恶煞的样子，坐在一堆废旧杂物上。"
"Only the sense of damnable iteration prevented him from saying: “It can’t go on, Fleur.”","只是因为他不想再重复了，才忍住没说：“不能这样下去了，弗勒。”"
"She knew that!","她何尝不知道呢！"
"And yet it did!","可是情况就是这样！"
"This was what perpetually amazed him.","这一点始终让他感到诧异。"
"How a poor brute could hang on week after week saying to her and to himself: “Now or never!” when it wasn’t either.","一个可怜虫怎么能每周都对她、对自己说：“现在不做就断绝关系！”而其实这两点他都办不到。"
"Subconsciousness, that, until the word ‘now’ had been reached, Fleur would not know her own mind, alone had kept him dancing.","他下意识地感觉到在所谓的“现在”实现之前，弗勒自己都不清楚她自己的心思，只有先晾着他了。"
"His own feelings were so intense that he almost hated her for indecision.","他对她的感情如此强烈，以至于他快受不了她的犹豫不决了。"
"And he was unjust.","但他错了。"
"It was not exactly indecision.","并不完全是犹豫不决。"
"Fleur wanted the added richness and excitement which Wilfrid’s affection gave to life, but without danger and without loss.","弗勒需要威尔弗里德的爱情给她的生活带来额外的丰富和刺激，而不会带来风险和损失。"
"How natural!","多自然的事啊！"
"His frightful passionateness was making all the trouble.","而他可怕的热情正是所有麻烦的根源。"
"Neither by her wish, nor through her fault, was he passionate!","他那热情既不是出于她的愿望，也不是由于她的过错！"
"And yet—it was both nice and proper to inspire passion; and, of course, she had the lurking sense that she was not ‘in the mode’ to cavil at a lover, especially since life owed her one.","不过——热情总能给人愉快和美好的感觉。当然，她还隐隐觉得，对情人过于挑剔有悖“时尚”，更何况她的生活缺少一个情人呢。"
"Released, she smoothed herself and said: “Talk of something sensible; what have you been writing?”","威尔弗里德放开手后，她整理了一下自己，说道：“谈点儿有意思的事吧，你最近在写些什么？”"
"“This.”","“这个。”"
"Fleur read.","弗勒翻了几页。"
"Flushing and biting her lips, she said:","她涨红了脸，咬着嘴唇，然后说道："
"“It’s frightfully bitter.”","“这个读起来让人很痛苦。”"
"“It’s frightfully true.","“却非常真实。"
"Does HE ever ask you now whether you see me?”","他现在还问你，你是否和我见面吗？”"
"“Never.”","“从来不问。”"
"“Why?”","“为什么？”"
"“I don’t know.”","“我也不知道。”"
"“What would you answer if he did?”","“如果他问起，你怎么作答？”"
"Fleur shrugged her shoulders.","弗勒耸了耸肩。"
"Desert said quietly: “Yes, that’s your attitude.","德赛特平静地说：“不错，这就是你的态度。"
"It can’t last, Fleur.”","不能这样下去了，弗勒。”"
"He was standing by the window.","此时，他正站在窗边。"
"She put the sheets down on his desk and moved towards him.","她把稿子放到书桌上，然后朝他走去。"
"Poor Wilfrid!","可怜的威尔弗里德！"
"Now that he was quiet she was sorry.","现在他平静了，她反倒难过起来。"
"He said suddenly: “Stop!","他突然说：“站住!"
"Don’t move!","别动！"
"HE’S down there in the street.”","他就在对面街上。”"
"Recoiling, she gasped: “Michael!","她一边后退，一边喘着气说：“迈克尔!"
"Oh!","哦！"
"But how—how could he have known?”","但是怎么——他怎么知道的呢？”"
"Desert said grimly: “Do you only know him as little as that?","德赛特冷冷地说：“你对他的了解就这么少吗？"
"Do you suppose he’d be there if he knew you were here?”","你觉得如果他知道你在这里，他还会站在那儿吗？”"
"Fleur winced.","弗勒畏缩了一下。"
"“Why IS he there, then?”","“那么，他为什么出现在那儿呢？”"
"“He probably wants to see me.","“他可能是来找我的。"
"He looks as if he couldn’t make up his mind.","他看上去还在犹豫。"
"Don’t get the wind up, he won’t be let in.”","别害怕，我不会让他进来的。”"
"Fleur sat down; she felt weak in the legs.","弗勒感觉双腿发软，坐了下来。"
"The ice seemed suddenly of an appalling thinness—the water appallingly cold.","那层冰似乎突然薄得可怕——水也冷得吓人。"
"“Has he seen you?” she said.","“他看见你了吗？”她说。"
"“No.”","“没有。”"
"The thought flashed through him: ‘If I were a blackguard, I could force her hand, by moving one step and crooking my finger.’","他脑海里突然闪过一个念头：“如果我是个无赖，我只要向前跨一步，勾一勾手指，就能逼她就范。”"
"Pity one wasn’t a blackguard—at all events, not to that point—things would be so much simpler!","可惜我不是无赖——无论如何，还没坏到那个地步——不然，事情就简单多了！"
"“Where is he now?” asked Fleur.","“他现在在哪儿？”弗勒问道。"
"“Going away.”","“离开了。”"
"In profound relief, she sighed out:","她这下放心了，深深吸了口气，说道："
"“But it’s queer, isn’t it, Wilfrid?”","“但是很奇怪，不是吗，威尔弗里德？”"
"“You don’t suppose he’s easy in his mind, do you?”","“你猜他的心里不好受，对吧？”"
"Fleur bit her lips.","弗勒咬着嘴唇。"
"He was jeering, because she didn’t or couldn’t really love either of them.","他这是在挪揄她，因为她不会、也不可能爱上他们中的任何一个人。"
"It was unjust.","这不公平。"
"She COULD have loved—she HAD loved!","她本应该可以爱的——她已经爱过了！"
"Wilfrid and Michael—they might go to the deuce!","威尔弗里德和迈克尔——让他们见鬼去吧！"
"“I wish I had never come here,” she said suddenly: “and I’ll never come again!”","“我真希望我从没来过这里。”她突然说道，“以后我不会再来了！”"
"He went to the door, and held it open.","他走到门口，打开房门。"
"“You are right.”","“你说的对。”"
"Fleur stood quite still, her chin on the collar of her fur, her clear-glancing eyes fixed on his face, her lips set and mutinous.","弗勒一动不动地站在那里，下巴露在皮毛领子外面，一双清澈的双眸紧紧盯着他的脸，双唇紧闭，样子十分反叛。"
"“You think I’m a heartless beast,” she said slowly.","“你认为我是个无情无义的人。”她缓缓地说，"
"“So I am—now.","“那我就是吧——从现在开始。"
"Good-bye!”","再见了！”"
"He neither took her hand nor spoke, he only bowed.","他既没和她握手，也没说话，只是鞠了一躬。"
"His eyes were very tragic.","他的目光非常悲惨。"
"Trembling with mortification, Fleur went out.","弗勒被羞辱得浑身发抖，走了出去。"
"She heard the door closed, while she was going down the stairs.","当她下楼时，她听到了关门声。"
"At the bottom she stood uncertain.","到楼下时，她犹豫地站住了。"
"Suppose Michael had come back!","万一迈克尔又回来了呢！"
"Almost opposite was that gallery where she had first met him and—Jon.","好像就在对面的美术馆，她第一次遇见他和——乔恩。"
"Slip across in there!","穿过街道，溜到那里去吧！"
"If he were still hovering round the entrance of the little street, she could tell him with a good conscience where she had been.","如果他还在这条小街口逗留，她就可以心安理得地告诉他，她刚才一直在那里。"
"She peeped.","她打探了一下。"
"Not in sight!","他没在！"
"Swiftly she slid across into the doorway opposite.","她迅速穿过马路，溜进对面的门口里。"
"They would be closing in a minute—just on four o’clock!","再过一分钟就关门了——正好4点钟！"
"She put down a shilling and slipped in.","她付了一先令，进去了。"
"She must see—in case!","她一定得看一看——万一！"
"She stood revolving—one-man show, the man—Claud Brains!","她站在那里环顾四周——是一场个人画展，作者——克劳德·布雷恩斯！"
"She put down another shilling for a catalogue, and read as she went out.","她又付了一先令，买了一本目录，边读边往外走。"
"“No. 7.","“第七号作品。"
"Woman getting the wind up.”","担惊受怕的女人。”"
"It told her everything; and with a lighter heart she skimmed along, and took a taxi.","这本目录写得很详细，她一路轻松地浏览着，然后坐上了出租车。"
"Get home before Michael!","赶在迈克尔之前回家！"
"She felt relieved, almost exhilarated.","她这才觉得放松了，简直太刺激了。"
"So much for skating on thin ice!","如履薄冰也不过如此么！"
"It wasn’t good enough.","不过这可不太好。"
"Wilfrid must go.","威尔弗里德必须离开。"
"Poor Wilfrid!","可怜的威尔弗里德！"
"Well, he shouldn’t have sneered—what did he know of her?","可是，他不该挪揄她——他了解她吗？"
"Nobody knew anything of her!","谁都不了解她！"
"She was alone in the world.","她在这个世界上是孤独的。"
"She slipped her latch-key into the hall door.","她把弹簧钥匙插进门厅的门上。"
"No Michael.","迈克尔还没回来。"
"She sat down in the drawing-room before the fire, and took up Walter Nazing’s last.","她在客厅的壁炉前坐下，然后拿起一本沃尔特·内津的近作。"
"She read a page three times.","她把一页书读了三遍。"
"It meant no more with every reading—it meant less; he was the kind of author who must be read at a gallop, and given away lest a first impression of wind in the hair be lost in a sensation of wind lower down; but Wilfrid’s eyes came between her and the words.","每读一遍，对书的内容并没有更深的了解——反而更少了。他这类作家的作品必须一口气读完，然后放在一边，否则开头留给你的第一印象就会在后面的阅读中消失得无影无踪了。可是，威尔弗里德的眼神却浮现在她阅读的文字上。"
"Pity!","怜悯！"
"Nobody pitied her; why, then, should she pity them?","没人怜悯她，那么，她为何要怜悯别人呢？"
"Besides, pity was ‘pop,’ as Amabel would say.","何况，正如阿玛贝尔所说，怜悯是“时髦的碳酸饮料”。"
"The situation demanded cast-iron sense.","这种情况需要刚毅的意志。"
"But Wilfrid’s eyes!","可是威尔弗里德的那双眼睛啊！"
"Well—she wouldn’t be seeing them again!","唉——她不会再看见那双眼睛了！"
"Beautiful eyes when they smiled or when—so much more often—they looked at her with longing, as now between her and the sentence: “Solemnly and with a delicious egoism he more than awfully desired her who snug and rosy in the pink shell of her involuted and so petulant social periphrasis—” Poor Wilfrid!","那双眼睛在微笑时或在——更多的时候——渴盼地望着她时，那是多美的双眸啊！此刻，这双美丽的眼睛正停留在她与这些字句之间：“他一本正经却又十分迫切地想要得到她，而她却置身于纷繁复杂、充斥着社交辞令的粉红色甲壳虫中，怡然自得——”可怜的威尔弗里德！"
"Pity was ‘pop,’ but there was pride!","怜悯是“时髦的碳酸饮料”，可是还有自豪啊！"
"Did she choose that he should go away thinking that she had ‘played him up’ just out of vanity, as Walter Nazing said American women did?","难道她要他离开，他会认为她只是由于虚荣在“玩弄他”，就像沃尔特·内津说的美国女人那样吗？"
"Did she?","她是这样的吗？"
"Would it not be more in the mode, really dramatic—if one ‘went over the deep end,’ as they said, just once?","如人们所说，如果一个人“冒险成功”，哪怕只有一次——会不会更时尚、更富有戏剧性呢？"
"Would that not be something they could both look back on—he in the East he was always talking of, she in this West?","当他们身处异地的时候——他在他常常谈起的东方，而她在这个西方——那不就成了一件值得他们两个人怀念的往事了吗？"
"The proposition had a momentary popularity in that organism called Fleur too finely proportioned for a soul according to the theory which Michael was thinking over.","在那个叫做弗勒的生物体内，这个假设在当时颇为时尚。依照迈克尔认真思考的理论，她如此优美、匀称，是不会有灵魂的。"
"Like all popularities, it did not last.","和流行事物一样，这种想法长不了。"
"First: Would she like it?","首先：她愿意这样吗？"
"She did not think she would; one man, without love, was quite enough.","她并不认为自己会喜欢。和一个不存在爱情的男人在一起，已经够了。"
"Then there was the danger of passing into Wilfrid’s power.","另外，还存在落入威尔弗里德掌控之中的危险。"
"He was a gentleman, but he was passionate; the cup once sipped, would he consent to put it down?","他是个有教养的人，但容易冲动。一旦从杯子里吸了一口，他还会轻易放下杯子吗？"
"But more than all was a physical doubt of the last two or three weeks which awaited verification, and which made her feel solemn.","但最主要的还是最近两三周里，她怀疑自己可能怀孕了，这让她觉得事情严重了。"
"She stood up and passed her hands all over her, with a definite recoil from the thought of Wilfrid’s hands doing the same.","她起身，用双手抚摸自己的全身，一想到威尔弗里德也是这样抚摸她的，她就明显地畏缩起来。"
"No!","不！"
"To have his friendship, his admiration, but not at that price.","她要得到他的友谊、爱慕，却不能付出那样的代价。"
"She viewed him, suddenly, as a bomb set on her copper floor; and in fancy ran and seized and flung him out into the Square—poor Wilfrid!","突然间，她把他视为安放在红棕色地板上的一枚炸弹，并且在幻想中，她奔过去一把抓住，把他扔到广场上——可怜的威尔弗里德！"
"Pity was ‘pop!’","怜悯是“时髦的碳酸饮料”！"
"But one might be sorry for ONESELF, losing him; losing too that ideal of modern womanhood expounded to her one evening by Marjorie Ferrar, pet of the ‘panjoys,’ whose red-gold hair excited so much admiration: “My ambition—old thing—is to be the perfect wife of one man, the perfect mistress of another, and the perfect mother of a third, all at once.","但是，如果失去了他，她会对感到懊恼；同时她也会失去现代女性观。一天晚上，“潘神教”的宠儿，有着人人称羡的金红色头发的玛乔丽·费拉尔曾经对弗勒解释这个道理：“老朋友，我的目标是要做一个男人十全十美的妻子，另一个男人完美无瑕的情妇，以及第三个人尽善尽美的母亲，所有这些同时进行。"
"It’s perfectly possible—they do it in France.”","这是完全可能的——法国人就是这样做的。”"
"But was it really so perfectly possible—even if pity WAS posh?","但这等好事真有可能发生吗——即使怜悯是时髦的？"
"How be perfect to Michael, when the slightest slip might reveal to him that she was being perfect to Wilfrid; how be perfect to Wilfrid, when every time she was perfect to Michael would be a dagger in Wilfrid’s heart?","如果稍不留神，让迈克尔发现他对威尔弗里德完美无瑕，那她还怎么对迈克尔十全十美呢；如果她每一次对迈克尔十全十美，就相当于往威尔弗里德的心上刺一刀，那她又怎么对威尔弗里德完美无瑕呢？"
"And if—if her physical doubt should mature into certainty, how be perfect mother to the certainty, when she was either torturing two men, or lying to them like a trooperess?","再如果——如果她确实怀孕了，而她却在折磨这两个男人，或者对他们信口开河、任意扯谎，那么在这个情况下，她又怎么能成为一个尽善尽美的母亲呢？"
"Not so perfectly possible as all that!","这并不像所说的那样完全可能！"
"‘If only I were all French!’ thought Fleur....","“我要是个彻头彻尾的法国人就好了！”弗勒陷入沉思……"
"The clicking door startled her—the reason that she was not all French was coming in.","房门咔哒的响声惊醒了她——那个让她成不了彻头彻尾的法国人的人走了进来。"
"He looked very grey, as if he had been thinking too much.","他面色很阴沉，好像是思虑过度。"
"He kissed her, and sat down moodily before the fire.","他吻了她一下，然后心神不定地坐在壁炉前。"
"“Have you come for the night, Dad?”","“在这里过夜吗，爸爸？”"
"“If I may,” murmured Soames.","“如果可以的话。”索姆斯低声说，"
"“Business.”","“生意上的事。”"
"“Anything unpleasant, ducky?”","“有什么不愉快的事吗，亲爱的爸爸？”"
"Soames looked up as if startled.","索姆斯像是受了惊吓似地抬起头来。"
"“Unpleasant?","“不愉快？"
"Why should it be unpleasant?”","为什么要不愉快呢？”"
"“I only thought from your face.”","“我只是从你的表情里猜的。”"
"Soames grunted.","索姆斯咕哝了一声。"
"“This Ruhr!” he said.","“这个鲁尔区！”他说，"
"“I’ve brought you a picture.","“我给你带来一幅画。"
"Chinese!”","中国的！”"
"“Oh, Dad!","“哦，爸爸！"
"How jolly!”","是幅有趣的！”"
"“It isn’t,” said Soames; “it’s a monkey eating fruit.”","“不是有趣的，”索姆斯说，“画的是一只猴子正在吃水果。”"
"“But that’s perfect!","“那好极了！"
"Where is it—in the hall?”","在哪儿？——门厅里吗？”"
"Soames nodded.","索姆斯点了点头。"
"Stripping the coverings off the picture, Fleur brought it in, and setting it up on the jade-green settee, stood away and looked at it.","弗勒打开包装纸，把画取出来，竖在那张翠绿色的长靠椅上，后退了几步，仔细观看。"
"The large white monkey with its brown haunting eyes, as if she had suddenly wrested its interest from the orange-like fruit in its crisped paw, the grey background, the empty rinds all round—bright splashes in a general ghostliness of colour, impressed her at once.","画面上，那只大白猿的褐色眼睛令人难忘。看那神情，仿佛是她突然间要从它蜷曲的爪子里夺走那橙子模样的水果似的。再加上那灰蒙蒙的背景、遍地的果皮——整幅画幽暗的主色调之外，有几抹鲜明的色调，立刻给她留下了深刻的印象。"
"“But, Dad, it’s a masterpiece—I’m sure it’s of a frightfully good period.”","“可是，爸爸，这是一幅杰作啊——我敢肯定它属于一个非常繁盛的时代。”"
"“I don’t know,” said Soames.","“我不知道。”索姆斯说，"

"You don’t seriously suppose this age is worse than any other?”","您不至于认为这个时代比其他任何时代都差劲吧？”"
"“Don’t I?” said Soames.","“为什么不呢？”索姆斯说道，"

"“Talking of God and diligences; I saw a hansom yesterday.”","“说到上帝和公共马车，我昨天看到一辆双座马车。”"
"‘More to the point if you’d seen God,’ thought Soames, but he did not say so; indeed, the thought surprised him, it was not the sort of thing he had ever seen himself.","“如果你说你见到上帝，那倒更切题些。”索姆斯心想，但他没说出来。的确，这样想连他自己也感到吃惊，这种事他自己都没见过。"
"“You mayn’t know it, sir, but there’s more belief now than there was before the war—they’ve discovered that we’re not all body.”","“您也许不知道，先生，但是现在的人可比战前的人更有信仰——人们已经发现人类不只有肉体。”"
"“Oh!” said Fleur.","“哦！”弗勒说道，"
"“That reminds me, Aubrey.","“这让我想起来了，奥布里。"

"I thought your Peke could make her, perhaps.”","我想，或许你这只哈巴狗能让她笑起来。”"
"“May I come and see?” said Fleur.","“我可以去看看吗？”弗勒说。"
"“Yes, bring him tomorrow; but, if I can persuade her, it’ll be in the ‘altogether.’”","“可以，明天你带它过来。不过，如果她能听我的话，那将是‘裸体画’。”"
"“Oh!","“啊！"
"Will you get me a seance, if I lend you Ting?”","如果我把叮铃借给你，你能给我找个通灵人吗？”"
"“I will.”","“能。”"
"“H’mph!” said Soames again.","“哼！”索姆斯又来一句。"

"Aubrey Greene took his departure a few minutes later, crossing a lady in the hall who was delivering her name to the manservant.","几分钟后，奥布里·格林也告辞了，他在门厅里遇见一位夫人，她正向男仆报自己的姓名。"
"Alone with her body, Fleur again passed her hands all over it.","弗勒独自与自己的肉体在一起，她又用双手抚摸了全身。"
"The ‘altogether’—was a reminder of the dangers of dramatic conduct.","“裸体画”一词让她意识到戏剧性举动的危险性。"

"She saw again her old kinsman’s japing eyes in the church when Fleur was being married, heard his throaty whisper, “Will she stay the course?”","她仿佛又看见了弗勒结婚时的那个教堂，她的这位年长的男亲戚有双嘲弄人的眼睛，她记得他当时低语道：“她不会中途变卦吧？”"

"“The new-faithfuls?”","“新宗教徒？”"
"“Oh! don’t you know—it’s a sort of faith-healing done on oneself, not exactly the old ‘God-good, good-God!’ sort; but a kind of mixture of will-power, psycho-analysis, and belief that everything will be all right on the night if you say it will.","“哦！您不知道吗——这是一种自我调节的信仰疗法，完全不是那种老式的‘上帝好，好上帝！’，而是一种混合疗法，包括意志力、心理分析和信念——如果你认为一夜之间什么都会变好，那么，转天就会变好。"

"Between the two tea-chests with their coloured pearl-shell figures, he would look his best.","把它挂在两只彩色珍珠贝图案的茶具中间，会显得非常出色。"
"Since she couldn’t have Jon, what did it matter—Wilfrid or Michael, or both, or neither?","既然她得不到乔恩，那么无论得到威尔弗里德还是迈克尔，或者两个都得到，或者两个都失去，又有什么关系呢？"

"During dinner, as if visited by remorse for having given them advice and two pictures worth some thousands of pounds, Soames pitched a tale like those of James in his palmy days.","吃晚饭的时候，索姆斯好像懊悔起来，觉得不该给他们提建议，还把两幅价值数千英镑的画送给他们了。他编了一个故事，像是詹姆斯在他的黄金时代讲的那些故事一样。"
"He spoke of the French—the fall of the mark—the rise in Consols—the obstinacy of Dumetrius, the picture-dealer, over a Constable skyscape which Soames wanted and Dumetrius did not, but to which the fellow held on just for the sake of a price which Soames did not mean to pay.","他谈到了法国人——马克的下跌——统一公债的上涨——顽固的画商杜梅特里斯，因为索姆斯看中一张康斯太布尔的天空景色画，杜梅特里斯虽然不想要，但却因为索姆斯不肯付他索要的高价而拒不放手。"

"As to the League of Nations, a man that morning had palavered it up.","至于国际联盟，那天早晨有人吹捧过它。"
"That cock wouldn’t fight—spend money, and arrange things which would have arranged themselves, but as for anything important, such as abolishing Bolshevism, or poison gas, they never would, and to pretend it was all-me-eye-and-Betty-Martin.","它不过是一只不能斗的鸡——浪费金钱去管理那些不必管也能做成的事情，而从来不管那些真正重要的事情，比如消灭布尔什维克主义或是有毒气体之类，还假称这些都是胡说八道。"
"It was almost a record for one habitually taciturn, and deeply useful to two young people only anxious that he should continue to talk, so that they might think of other things.","对于一个向来沉默寡言的人来说，说这么多话简直就是破纪录了。两个年轻人觉得这些话很有用，迫切希望他继续说下去，这样他们就能想别的事情了。"

"Fleur thought it due to the copper floor.","弗勒觉得那是红棕色地板造成的。"
"Soames that he must have picked up something in the Square—dogs were always picking things up.","索姆斯认为它一定是在广场上捡什么东西吃了——狗总是喜欢捡东西吃的。"
"Michael suggested that it was just Chinese—a protest against there being nobody to watch his self-sufficiency.","迈克尔认为这只是它在发中国式的脾气——抗议没有人注意它的自负。"
"“No retreat, no retreat; they must conquer or die who have no retreat!”","“没有退路，没有退路；没有退路的人必须获胜，否则就是死路一条！”"

"Michael stood up.","迈克尔站了起来。"
"“Wouldn’t you like my den, sir?”","“您不喜欢在我的书斋里算吗，先生？”"
"“No,” said Soames, “I must concentrate.","“不了，”索姆斯说，“我必须集中精神才行。"
"Say goodnight to Fleur for me.”","替我向弗勒说晚安。”"
"Michael remained smoking above the porcelain effigies of Spanish fruits.","迈克尔还在抽烟，低头看着那几只瓷制的西班牙水果。"
"That white monkey couldn’t eat those and throw away the rinds!","那只白猿是无法吃掉这些瓷水果，然后扔掉果皮的！"
"Would the fruits of his life be porcelain in future?","他自己人生的果实将来也会像这些瓷水果一样吗？"

"Which of the three courses was least to be deplored?","这三条路选哪一条才能最不后悔？"

"(The Governor had got the hump—good sort, the Governor!) Decision waited for him, somewhere, somewhen—Fleur’s, not his own.","（主人生气了——好样的，主人！）决定已经做好，就等着告诉他了，某个时间，某个地方——那是弗勒的决定，不是他的。"
"His mind was too miserable and disconcerted to be known; but she would know hers.","他心里装了太多的痛苦，太乱了，已经没办法想明白了。但是她明白她自己的心。"
"She had the information which alone made decision possible about Wilfrid, that cousin, her own actions and feelings.","她所知道的情况足以让她自己下决定，怎么处理威尔弗里德和那个堂兄弟，还有她自己的行动和感情。"
"Yes, decision would come, and would it matter in a world where pity was punk and only a Chinese philosophy of any use?","是的，决定会做出来的。然而在这个世界里，同情是无用的，只有中国哲学能派上点儿用场，这个决定又能有多重要呢？"
"But not be sick in the drawing-room, try and keep one’s end up, even if there were no one to see one being important!...","但是，不要在客厅里吐，即使人们都看不到你的重要性，在苦难面前也要坚持不懈！……"
"He had been asleep and it was dark, or all but, in his bed-dressing-room.","他的卧室兼更衣室里已经基本上一团漆黑，他已经睡着了。"
"Something white by his bed.","床边有些白色的东西。"

"Michael’s heart, wild, confused, beat against hers.","迈克尔的心和她的心贴在一起，疯狂而又迷茫地跳动着。"

"Chapter VII","第七章"
"The Altogether","裸体画"
"Tony Bicket, replete, was in vein that fine afternoon; his balloons left him freely, and he started for home in the mood of a conqueror.","那天下午天气很好，托尼·比克特吃饱喝足之后，心情愉快。他的气球卖得很好，于是他怀着胜利的心情动身回家了。"
"Victorine, too, had colour in her cheeks.","维多琳的双颊也有了血色。"
"She requited the story of his afternoon with the story of hers.","她听他讲完下午的故事后，也把她的故事讲给他听。"
"A false tale for a true—no word of Danby and Winter, the gentleman with the sliding smile, of the Grand Marnier, or ‘the altogether.’","不过刚才听的是真故事，现在讲的是假故事——她没有提丹比&温特出版社，或是那个笑容圆滑的先生，也没有提柑曼怡酒或者“裸体画”。"
"She had no compunction.","她并没有良心不安。"
"It was her secret, her surprise; if, by sitting in or out of ‘the altogether,’ not yet decided, she could make their passage money—well, she should tell him she had won it on a horse.","这是她的秘密，她的惊人之举。如果坐在那里当模特让人作画——或是“裸体画”，这件事她还没拿定主意——能够让她赚到他们的路费的话，那她会告诉他这是她赌马赢来的钱。"

"They dreamed together of blue butterflies, and awoke to chilly gaslight and a breakfast of cocoa and bread-and-butter.","他们一起梦见了蓝色的蝴蝶，醒来后看到的却是煤气灯的冷光以及一顿可可和黄油面包的早餐。"
"Fog!"
"Bicket was swallowed up before the eyes of Victorine ten yards from the door.","比克特走出家门还不到十米，就在维多琳的眼前被大雾吞没了。"
"She returned to the bedroom with anger in her heart.","她回到卧室，感到愤愤不平。"
"Who would buy balloons in a fog?","谁会在雾天来买气球呢？"
"She would do anything rather than let Tony go on standing out there all the choking days!","她什么都愿意干，只要能够不让比克特在这种令人窒息的天气里一直站在外面！"

"Hope they’ll be useful.—Yours, MICHAEL MONT.”","希望你用得上。——迈克尔·蒙特敬礼。”"
"In a voice that trembled she said to the boy:","她用颤抖的声音对送信人说："

"When his rich whistle was heard writhing into the fog, she flung herself down before the ‘togs’ in ecstasy.","等到送信人响亮的口哨声从雾中隐隐传来的时候，她已经欣喜若狂地扑到那堆“衣服”面前了。"
"The sexes were divided by tissue paper.","男女衣服是用薄纸隔开的。"
"A blue suit, a velour hat, some brown shoes, three pairs of socks with two holes in them, four shirts only a little frayed at the cuffs, two black-and-white ties, six collars, not too new, some handkerchiefs, two vests beautifully thick, two pairs of pants, and a brown overcoat with a belt and just two or three nice little stains.","一件蓝色套装、一顶绒帽、几双棕色的鞋子、三双有两个洞的袜子、四件袖口有点儿磨损的衬衣、两条黑白相间的领带、六件不太新的硬领、几块手绢、两件漂亮的厚背心、两条裤子，还有一件棕色带腰带的大衣，上面只有两三个不难看的小污迹。"
"She held the blue suit up against her arms and legs, the trousers and sleeves would only need taking-in about two inches.","她拿起那套蓝色的衣服，在自己的胳膊和腿上比试着，裤腿和袖口只需要收进去两英寸左右就行了。"

"Two pairs of brown stockings; brown shoes; two combinations, a knitted camisole.","两双棕色的长筒袜、棕色的鞋子、两件连裤内衣、一件针织短袖衬衣。"

"She took a deep breath of sweetness—geranium!","她深深地吸了一口上面的香气——天竺葵！"
"Her mind leaped forward.","她的思绪远远地跳跃开来。"

"No!","不！"

"Geranium!","天竺葵！"
"This, then, was she whose clothes—!","那么，就是她把自己的衣服——！"

"You’ll find everything in there.","您在那儿能找到你需要的一切东西。"

"Many, many fifteen bobs before—!","许多、许多15个先令，然后——！"
"But not more times of sitting than of Tony’s standing from foot to foot, offering balloons.","但是她坐着的次数不会比托尼站着的次数多的。他就是那样两只脚换着站在那里卖气球。"
"And as if wound up by that thought, she moved like clockwork off the dais, into the model’s room.","这样想着，她高兴起来了。她机械地离开了那个台子，走进模特的房间里去了。"
"Cosy in there, too; warm, a green silk garment thrown on a chair.","那里面也很舒服、温暖，椅子上扔着一件绿色丝绸长袍。"

"She couldn’t—no! she couldn’t.","她不能——不！她不能。"
"She caught up her final garment again.","她再次抓住自己最后的一件衣服。"
"Fifteen bob!","15先令！"
"But fifteen bob!","那可是15先令啊！"
"Before her eyes, wild and mournful, came a vision: Of a huge dome, and a tiny Tony, with little, little balloons in a hand held out!","她的眼前出现了一个荒凉而又令人心伤的幻象：在一个巨大的穹顶下，渺小的托尼拿着一个个小小的气球！"
"Something cold and steely formed over her heart as icicles form on a window.","一些又冷又硬的东西在她的心里凝结，就像是冬天窗户上形成的冰柱。"
"If that was all they would do for him, she would do better!","如果他们只肯为他做这些，那么她会为他做得更好！"

"That’s right!","就是这样！"
"The flesh tone’s perfect!","皮肤的色调美极了！"
"My God, why must one walk before one runs!","上帝啊，为什么一定要先会走才能跑啊！"
"Drawing’s a bore, Miss Collins; one ought to draw with a brush only; a sculptor draws with a chisel, at least when he’s a Michelangelo.","素描是一件令人讨厌的事，柯林斯小姐，人应该只用画笔来画画，而雕塑家是用凿子作画的，至少在他是个米开朗基罗的时候。"
"How old are you?”","您今年多大了？”"
"“Twenty-one,” came from lips that seemed to Victorine quite far away.","“21了。”维多琳嘴里发出的声音在她自己听来好像来自遥远的地方。"

"“We don’t even believe in our ancestors.","“我们连自己的祖先都不相信。"
"All the same, we’re beginning to copy them again.","尽管如此，我们又开始效仿他们了。"
"D’you know a book called ‘The Sobbing Turtle’ that’s made such a fuss?—sheer Sterne, very well done; but sheer Sterne, and the author’s tongue in his cheek.","您知不知道一本叫《啜泣的海龟》的书？它可是轰动一时的——完全斯特恩式的，写得很好，纯粹斯特恩式的写法，假情假意的。"
"That’s it in a nutshell, Miss Collins—our tongues are in our cheeks—bad sign.","简单地说，就那么回事。柯林斯小姐——要是我们都毫无诚意——那可不是个好兆头。"

"Probably all the inhabitants of Britain left alive by the Saxons were called Brown.","很可能在撒克逊入侵后所有活下来的英国人都叫布朗。"
"As a fact, that’s all tosh, though.","但是，事实上，那都是胡说八道。"
"Going back to Edward the Confessor, Miss Collins—a mere thirty generations—we each of us have one thousand and seventy-four million, five hundred and seventy-three thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four ancestors, and the population of this island was then well under a million.","从忏悔者爱德华起到现在，柯林斯小姐——不过才30代——我们每个人就有10亿多个祖先，而当时这个岛上总共还不到100万人呢。"
"We’re as inbred as racehorses, but not so nice to look at, are we?","就像赛马一样，我们都是近亲繁殖的，但是长得不怎么好看，是不是？"
"I assure you, Miss Collins, you’re something to be grateful for.","我敢说，柯林斯小姐，您长得这么漂亮真该感谢上帝。"
"So is Mrs. Mont.","蒙特夫人也一样。"
"Isn’t she pretty?","她漂亮吧？"
"Look at that dog?”","看看她那只狗？”"
"Ting-a-ling, indeed, with forelegs braced, and wrinkled nose, was glaring, as if under the impression that Victorine was another bone.","没错，小叮铃伸直了前腿，皱着鼻子，正在看着她，好像觉得她也是一根骨头。"
"“He’s funny,” she said, and again her voice sounded far away.","“它很滑稽。”她说，感觉声音再一次从远方传来。"
"Would Mrs. Mont lie here if he’d asked her?","如果他向蒙特夫人提出请求，她会趴在这里吗？"
"SHE would look pretty!","如果是她的话，一定很好看！"
"But SHE didn’t need the fifteen bob!","但是她不需要这15先令！"
"“Comfortable in that position?”","“这个姿势舒服吗？”"
"In alarm, she murmured:","她吓了一跳，小声说："
"“Oh! yes, thank you!”","“哦！舒服，谢谢您！”"
"“Warm enough?”","“够暖和吗？”"
"“Oh! yes, thank you!”","“哦！暖和，谢谢您！”"

"Chapter VIII","第八章"
"Soames Takes the Matter up","索姆斯着手处理此事"
"Soames had concentrated, sitting before the fire in his bedroom till Big Ben struck twelve.","索姆斯坐在卧室的壁炉前，全神贯注地思考着，直到大本钟敲了12下。"
"His reflections sum-totalled in a decision to talk it over with ‘old Mont’ after all.","他的思绪始终围绕着是否要把这件事和“老蒙特”好好谈一谈。"
"Though light-brained, the fellow was a gentleman, and the matter delicate.","这个人虽然头脑简单，但却是一个通情达理的人，而且这件事又很棘手。"
"He got into bed and slept, but awoke at half-past two.","他上床去睡觉，但到了两点半就醒了。"
"There it was!","就是这件事！"
"‘I WON’T think of it,’ he thought; and instantly began to.","“我不要想它了。”他想，但是马上又开始想了。"
"In a long life of dealings with money, he had never had such an experience.","在与金钱打交道的漫长一生中，他还从未有过这种经历。"
"Perfectly straightforward conformity with the law—itself so often far from perfectly straightforward—had been the sine qua non of his career.","绝对诚实地遵守法律——法律本身常常又不是绝对诚实的——是他职业生涯的必备条件。"
"Honesty, they said, was the best policy.","有人说，诚实才是上策。"
"But was it anything else?","但是，还有别的上策吗？"
"A normally honest man couldn’t keep out of a perfect penitentiary for a week.","一个普通的诚实人要使自己一个星期不进合法的教养院是不可能的。"
"But then a perfect penitentiary had no relation to prison, or the Bankruptcy Court.","但是一个合法的教养院与监狱或破产法庭没有任何关系。"
"The business of working honesty was to keep out of those two institutions.","遵循诚实就是要远离那两个机构。"
"And so far he had never had any difficulty.","到目前为止，他还没遇到过什么困难。"
"What, besides the drawing of fees and the drinking of tea, were the duties of a director?","除了领取酬劳和喝茶之外，董事的职责是什么？"
"That was the point.","这就是问题所在。"
"And how far, if he failed in them, was he liable?","如果他没有尽到职责，他要负多大的责任呢？"
"It was a director’s duty to be perfectly straightforward.","董事的职责就是要绝对诚实。"
"But if a director were perfectly straightforward, he couldn’t be a director.","但是如果一个董事真的绝对诚实，他就做不成董事了。"
"That was clear.","这是显而易见的。"
"In the first place, he would have to tell his shareholders that he didn’t anything like earn his fees.","首先，他将不得不告诉股东们，他没有做任何应该得到酬劳的事情。"
"For what did he do on his Boards?","那么他在董事会里都做了些什么呢？"
"Well, he sat and signed his name and talked a little, and passed that which the general trend of business decided must be passed.","哦，他就坐着，签签名，发发言，以及通过那些由于业务的总趋势所决定的必须通过的事情。"
"Did he initiate?","他提过什么倡议吗？"
"Once in a blue moon.","极其罕见。"
"Did he calculate?","他进行过核算吗？"
"No, he read calculations.","没有，他只看核算的结果。"
"Did he check payments out and in?","他检查过支出和收入吗？"
"No, the auditors did that.","没有，那是审计人员做的。"
"There was policy!","还有方针政策！"
"A comforting word, but—to be perfectly straightforward—a director’s chief business was to let the existing policy alone.","这是个令人感到安慰的词，但是——绝对诚实地讲——董事的主要职责就是不要干涉现行的方针政策。"
"Take his own case!","就以他自己为例吧！"
"If he had done his duty, he would have stopped this foreign insurance business which he had instinctively distrusted the moment he heard of it—within a month of sitting on the Board, or, having failed in doing so, resigned his seat.","如果他履行了自己的职责，那么他就会停止这项国外保险业务，他在一听到这项业务时就本能地产生了怀疑——那时也就刚入董事会还不到一个月，或者，如果停止不了这项业务，他就辞职。"
"But he had not.","但是他没有这么做。"
"Things had been looking better!","情况一直在好转啦！"
"It was not the moment, and so forth!","时机还不成熟，等等！"
"If he had done his duty as a perfectly straightforward director, indeed, he would never have become a director of the P. P. R. S., because he would have looked into the policy of the Society much more closely than he had before accepting a position on the Board.","如果他真的像一个绝对诚实的董事那样履行自己的职责，那他就绝不会成为天佑再保险公司的董事，因为在接受董事会的这个职务之前，他会更加仔细地调查这家公司的方针政策。"
"But what with the names, and the prestige, and not looking a gift horse too closely in the mouth—there it had been!","但是为了名声、威望以及不能对收到的礼物吹毛求疵——事情就变成了这个样子！"
"To be perfectly straightforward, he ought now to be circularising the shareholders, saying: “My laissez-faire has cost you two hundred odd thousand pounds.","要做到绝对诚实，他现在就应该挨个通知股东们，说：“我的放任政策已经使你们损失了二十多万英镑。"
"I have lodged this amount in the hands of trustees for your benefit, and am suing the rest of the directors for their quotas of the amount.”","为了你们的利益，我已经将这笔钱放在了受托人那里，同时我正在起诉其他的董事，要求他们赔偿这笔款项中他们应负责的份额。”"
"But he was not proposing to do so, because—well—because it wasn’t done, and the other directors wouldn’t like it.","但是他不打算这么做，因为——呃——没有人这么做过，而且其他的董事不会喜欢这种做法。"
"In sum: You waited till the shareholders found out the mess, and you hoped they wouldn’t.","总而言之，你等着股东们发现这一混乱情况，而你又希望他们不会发现。"
"In fact, just like a Government, you confused the issues, and made the best case you could for yourselves.","事实上，就如同政府一样，你把问题搞乱，然后尽力为自己创造最有利的局面。"
"With a sense of comfort Soames thought of Ireland: The late Government had let the country in for all that mess in Ireland, and at the end taken credit for putting an end to what need never have been!","索姆斯想到了爱尔兰，不由得心生安慰：上一届政府让全国陷入到爱尔兰的混乱之中，最后因为结束了这种原本绝对不应该发生的情况而广受赞誉！"
"The Peace, too, and the Air Force, and Agriculture, and Egypt—the five most important issues they’d had to deal with—they had put the chestnuts into the fire in every case!","还有和平、空军、农业以及埃及——他们必须面对的五个最重要的问题——每一个问题他们都是在自找麻烦！"
"But had they confessed to it?","但是他们承认了吗？"
"Not they.","他们才不会呢。"
"One didn’t confess.","没人承认。"
"One said: “The question of policy made it imperative at the time.”","有人说：“在那时，政策问题使之势在必行。”"
"Or, better still, one said nothing; and trusted to the British character.","或者，更好的办法是，什么也不说，光指望英国人的品行。"
"With his chin resting on the sheet, Soames felt a momentary relief.","索姆斯将下巴放在床单上，感到了暂时的解脱。"
"The late Government weren’t sweating into THEIR sheets—not they—he was convinced of it!","上一届政府才不会出汗到弄湿他们自己的床单呢——他们才不会——对此他确信无疑！"
"Fixing his eyes on the dying embers in the grate, he reflected on the inequalities and injustices of existence.","他盯着壁炉里即将燃尽的余火，心中思考着现实中的不平等和不公正。"
"Look at the chaps in politics and business, whose whole lives were passed in skating on thin ice, and getting knighted for it.","看看政界和商界的那些家伙们，他们的一生都在冒险，并因此加官晋爵。"
"They never turned a hair.","他们泰然自若。"
"And look at himself, for the first time in forty years on thin ice, and suffering confoundedly.","再看看他自己，40年来第一次毛线，就痛苦得要命。"
"There was a perfect cult of hoodwinking the public, a perfect cult of avoiding the consequences of administrative acts; and here was he, a man of the world, a man of the law, ignorant of those cults, and—and glad of it.","有一种蒙蔽大众的完美的热潮，一种避免行政行为后果的完美的热潮，然而他这个深谙世故、精通法律的人，却对那些热潮一无所知，而且——而且还为此感到高兴。"
"From engrained caution and a certain pride, which had in it a touch of the fine, Soames shrank from that coarse-grained standard of honesty which conducted the affairs of the British public.","由于根深蒂固的谨慎和某种自豪感——这种性格也不无优点，索姆斯对于管理英国公众事务的粗鄙的诚实标准避而远之。"
"In anything that touched money he was, he always had been, stiff-necked, stiff-kneed.","在任何涉及金钱的问题上，他是且一向是固执己见、不肯让步的。"
"Money was money, a pound a pound, and there was no way of pretending it wasn’t and keeping your self-respect.","钱就是钱，一英镑就是一英镑，要假装钱不是钱，又要保持自尊心，那是不可能的。"
"He got up, drank some water, took a number of deep breaths, and stamped his feet.","他从床上起来，喝了点儿水，做了几次深呼吸，又跺了跺脚。"
"Who was it said the other day that nothing had ever lost him five minutes’ sleep.","前几天不知是谁说的，从来没有过什么事情能让他损失五分钟的睡眠。"
"The fellow must have the circulation of an ox, or the gift of Baron Munchausen.","那家伙一定具有像公牛一样的血液循环，或者具有吹牛大王的天赋。"
"He took up a book.","他拿起一本书。"
"But his mind would only turn over and over the realisable value of his resources.","但是他的脑子翻来覆去地想着他的财产可以变现成多少钱。"
"Apart from his pictures, he decided that he could not be worth less than two hundred and fifty thousand pounds, and there was only Fleur—and she already provided for more or less.","除了他的藏画之外，他断定他的财产不会少于25万英镑，而且只有弗勒一个孩子——她已经多少做了些准备。"
"His wife had her settlement, and could live on it perfectly well in France.","他的妻子有她自己的安置费，她可以靠这笔钱在法国生活得很好。"
"As for himself—what did he care?","至于他自己——他有什么在乎的？"
"A room at his club near Fleur—he would be just as happy, perhaps happier!","在他的俱乐部里找一个房间，离弗勒不远——他一样过得很快活，或许会更快活！"
"And suddenly he found that he had reached a way out of his disturbance and anxiety.","于是他突然发现自己已经找到了摆脱烦恼和焦虑的途径。"
"By imagining the far-fetched, by facing the loss of his wealth, he had exorcised the demon.","他想象着那些牵强附会的事情，面对着自己财产的损失，他终于驱逐了心魔。"
"The book, ‘The Sobbing Turtle,’ of which he had not read one word, dropped from his hand; he slept....","那本《啜泣的乌龟》，他一个字也没有看，从他手中掉了下来。他睡着了……"
"His meeting with ‘Old Mont’ took place at ‘Snooks’ directly after lunch.","刚一吃过午饭，他就去“轻蔑”俱乐部和“老蒙特”见面。"
"The tape in the hall, at which he glanced on going in, recorded a further heavy drop in the mark.","进去的时候，他朝大厅里的行情收录带瞥了一眼，上面记录着马克又一次大跌了。"
"Just as he thought: The thing was getting valueless!","正如他所想的那样：这东西正在变得一文不值！"
"Sitting there, sipping coffee, the baronet looked to Soames almost offensively spry.","准男爵坐在那里，小口地抿着咖啡，神情活泼地看着索姆斯，那样子简直让人反感。"
"Two to one he had realised nothing!","他肯定什么都不知道呢！"
"‘Well!’ thought Soames,’ as old Uncle Jolyon used to say, I shall astonish his weak nerves!’","“嗯！”索姆斯想，“就像乔里恩叔叔过去常说的那样，我要吓一吓他那脆弱的神经！”"
"And without preamble he began.","于是他开门见山地开始了。"
"“How are you, Mont?","“你好吗，蒙特？"
"This mark’s valueless.","马克一文不值了。"
"You realise we’ve lost the P. P. R. S. about a quarter of a million by that precious foreign policy of Elderson’s.","你知道，由于埃尔德森那宝贵的国外方针政策，我们已经使天佑再保险公司损失了大约25万英镑。"
"I’m not sure an action won’t lie against us for taking unjustifiable risk.","我不敢肯定人们不会因为我们冒了不合理的风险而起诉我们。"
"But what I’ve come to see you about is this.”","我来这里见你就是为了这件事。”"
"He retailed the interview with the clerk, Butterfield, watching the eyebrows of his listener, and finished with the words: “What do you say?”","他把和职员巴特菲尔德面谈的情况详细说了一遍，他看着倾听者的眉毛，以这样一句话结尾：“你怎么看？”"
"Sir Lawrence, whose foot was jerking his whole body, fixed his monocle.","劳伦斯爵士，从脚开始全身都在颤抖，固定好他的单片眼镜。"
"“Hallucination, my dear Forsyte!","“那一定是幻觉，我亲爱的福赛特！"
"I’ve known Elderson all my life.","我认识埃尔德森一辈子了。"
"We were at Winchester together.”","我们一起在温切斯特呆过。”"
"Again!","又来了！"
"Again!","又来了！"
"Oh!","哦！"
"Lord!","上帝啊！"
"Soames said slowly:","索姆斯慢慢地说："
"“You can’t tell from that.","“仅凭那一点你是判断不出什么的。"
"A man who was at Marlborough with me ran away with his mess fund and his colonel’s wife, and made a fortune in Chili out of canned tomatoes.","有一个和我一起在莫尔伯勒呆过的人，带着伙食团的资金和他的上校的老婆跑了，后来在智利做番茄罐头发了财。"
"The point is this: If the young man’s story’s true, we’re in the hands of a bad hat.","问题在于：如果这个年轻人说的是真的，那我们就落在了一个坏蛋的手中。"
"It won’t do, Mont.","这可不行，蒙特。"
"Will you tackle him, and see what he says to it?","你可不可以去和他交涉一下，看看他对这件事怎么说？"
"You wouldn’t like a story of that sort about yourself.","你也不希望那种事情发生在你身上。"
"Shall we both go?”","我们一起去好吗？”"
"“Yes,” said Sir Lawrence, suddenly.","“好的，”劳伦斯爵士突然说，"
"“You’re right.","“你说得对。"
"We’ll both go, Forsyte.","我们一起去，福赛特。"
"I don’t like it, but we’ll both go.","我不喜欢这种事，但是我们要一起去。"
"He ought to hear it.”","他应该听一听这件事。”"
"“Now?”","“现在就去吗？”"
"“Now.”","“现在就去。”"
"With solemnity they assumed top hats, and issued.","他们一本正经地戴上大礼帽，然后出发了。"
"“I think, Forsyte, we’ll take a taxi.”","“我想，福赛特，我们坐出租车去吧。”"
"“Yes,” said Soames.","“好的。”索姆斯说。"
"The cab ground its way slowly past the lions, then dashed on down to the Embankment.","一路上，出租车缓慢地驶过两座狮子，然后朝着堤岸疾驰而去。"
"Side by side its occupants held their noses steadily before them.","车上的两个乘客肩并肩地坐着，鼻子坚定地朝向前方。"
"“He was shooting with me a month ago,” said Sir Lawrence.","“一个月之前他还和我一起打猎呢，”劳伦斯爵士说，"
"“Do you know the hymn ‘O God, our help in ages past’?","“你知道《上帝是我们的万世救主》这首赞美诗吗？"
"It’s very fine, Forsyte.”","这首诗写得非常好，福赛特。”"
"Soames did not answer.","索姆斯没有回答。"
"The fellow was beginning to tittup!","这个家伙又开始絮叨了！"
"“We had it that Sunday,” went on Sir Lawrence.","“那个礼拜天我们就唱了这首诗，”劳伦斯爵士接着说，"
"“Elderson used to have a fine voice—sang solos.","“埃尔德森以前有一副好嗓子——唱过好几次独唱曲目。"
"It’s a foghorn now, but a good delivery still.”","现在像雾号一样又粗又哑，但是演唱的姿态依然很不错。”"
"He gave his little whinnying laugh.","他发出一阵短暂的马嘶般的笑声。"
"‘Is it possible,’ thought Soames, ‘for this chap to be serious?’ and he said:","索姆斯想：“这个家伙能严肃起来吗？”于是他说："
"“If we find this is true of Elderson, and conceal it, we could all be put in the dock.”","“如果我们发现埃尔德森这件事是真的，又把它隐瞒起来，我们都会被押上被告席。”"
"Sir Lawrence refixed his monocle.","劳伦斯爵士又夹了夹他的单片眼镜。"
"“The deuce!” he said.","“见鬼！”他说。"
"“Will you do the talking,” said Soames, “or shall I?”","“是你来谈呢，”索姆斯说，“还是我来谈呢？”"
"“I think you had better, Forsyte; ought we to have the young man in?”","“我想最好还是你来谈吧，福赛特，我们该不该把那个年轻人找来？”"
"“Wait and see,” said Soames.","“看情况再说。”索姆斯说。"
"They ascended to the offices of the P. P. R. S. and entered the Board Room.","他们爬上楼，到了天佑再保险公司的办公室，然后走进董事会会议室。"
"There was no fire, the long table was ungarnished; an old clerk, creeping about like a fly on a pane, was filling inkstands out of a magnum.","室内没有生火，那张长桌子未作任何装饰。那里有一名年老的职员，他像窗格玻璃上的苍蝇一样蹒跚地走着，正在把一只大墨水瓶里的墨水倒进墨水台里。"
"Soames addressed him:","索姆斯对他说："
"“Ask the manager to be so kind as to come and see Sir Lawrence Mont and Mr. Forsyte.”","“请经理劳驾来见一见劳伦斯·蒙特爵士和福赛特先生。”"
"The old clerk blinked, put down the magnum, and went out.","老职员眨了眨眼睛，放下大墨水瓶，走了出去。"
"“Now,” said Soames in a low voice, “we must keep our heads.","“现在，”索姆斯小声说，“我们必须保持头脑冷静。"
"He’ll deny it, of course.”","当然，他会否认这件事的。”"
"“I should hope so, Forsyte; I should hope so.","“我倒希望如此，福赛特，我倒希望如此。"
"Elderson’s a gentleman.”","埃尔德森是一个绅士。”"
"“No liar like a gentleman,” muttered Soames, below his breath.","“没有哪个骗子像绅士。”索姆斯低声咕哝道。"
"After that they stood in their overcoats before the empty grate, staring at their top hats placed side by side on the table.","之后他们就穿着大衣站在空空的壁炉前面，注视着并排放在桌上的大礼帽。"
"“One minute!” said Soames, suddenly, and crossing the room, he opened a door opposite.","“等一下！”索姆斯突然说，然后他穿过房间，打开了对面的一扇门。"
"There, as the young clerk had said, was a sort of lobby between Board Room and Manager’s Room, with a door at the end into the main corridor.","正如那个年轻的职员所说的，在董事会会议室和经理室之间有一个大厅，它的尽头是一扇通向走廊的门。"
"He stepped back, closed the door, and, rejoining Sir Lawrence, resumed his contemplation of the hats.","他退了回来，关上门，又和劳伦斯爵士站在一起，继续注视着那两顶帽子。"
"“Geography correct,” he said with gloom.","“地形是对的。”他忧郁地说。"
"The entrance of the manager was marked by Sir Lawrence’s monocle dropping on to his coat-button with a tinkle.","经理进来的时候，劳伦斯爵士的单片眼镜叮当一声掉在了他的大衣纽扣上。"
"In cutaway black coat, clean-shaven, with grey eyes rather baggy underneath, a pink colour, every hair in place on a rather bald egg-shaped head, and lips alternately pouting, compressed, or smiling, the manager reminded Soames ridiculously of old Uncle Nicholas in his middle period.","经理穿着下摆裁成圆角的黑色外套，胡子刮得很干净，一双灰色的眼睛下有着大大的眼袋，粉红色的皮肤，头发不多的鸡蛋型脑袋上，每一根头发都梳得很整齐；他嘴唇时而撅起，时而紧闭，又时而露出微笑，他的模样莫名其妙地使索姆斯联想到了当年人处中年的老尼古拉斯叔叔。"
"Uncle Nick was a clever fellow—“cleverest man in London,” some one had called him—but none had ever impugned his honesty.","尼克叔叔是个聪明人——有人称他为“伦敦最聪明的人”——但是从来没有人对他的诚实表示过怀疑。"
"A pang of doubt and disinclination went through Soames.","索姆斯感到一阵怀疑和厌恶的痛苦。"
"This seemed a monstrous thing to have to put to a man of his own age and breeding.","怀疑一个和自己年龄相仿且受过同等教育的人，这似乎是一件非常荒谬的事情。"
"But young Butterfield’s eyes—so honest and doglike!","但是年轻的巴特菲尔德的眼睛——那么真诚和忠实！"
"Invent a thing like that—was it possible?","捏造这样一件事情——可能吗？"
"He said abruptly:","他突然说："
"“Is that door shut?”","“那扇门关着吗？”"
"“Yes; do you feel a draught?” said the manager.","“关着呢，您是不是觉得有一股过堂风？”经理说，"
"“Would you like a fire?”","“要不要把火生上？”"
"“No, thank you,” said Soames.","“不用了，谢谢你，”索姆斯说，"
"“The fact is, Mr. Elderson, a young man in this office came to me yesterday with a very queer story.","“事情是这样的，埃尔德森先生。这个办公室的一个年轻人昨天来找我，并给我讲了一件非常奇怪的事情。"
"Mont and I think you should hear it.”","蒙特和我认为你应该听一下。”"
"Accustomed to watching people’s eyes, Soames had the impression of a film (such as passes over the eyes of parrots) passing over the eyes of the manager.","索姆斯习惯于观察人们的眼睛，他觉得有一层薄膜（就像鹦鹉眼睛上滑过的薄膜）掠过了经理的眼睛。"
"It was gone at once, if, indeed, it had ever been.","如果它确实存在的话，那也是一闪而过的。"
"“By all means.”","“当然可以。”"
"Steadily, with that power he had over his nerves when it came to a point, and almost word for word, Soames repeated a story which he had committed to heart in the watches of the night.","每到紧要关头，索姆斯都有控制自己情绪的能力，他沉着地几乎一字一句地把他在夜不成寐时熟记于心的事情复述了一遍。"
"He concluded with:","最后他说："
"“You’d like him in, no doubt.","“毫无疑问，你想让他进来一下吧。"
"His name is Butterfield.”","他的名字叫做巴特菲尔德。”"
"During the recital Sir Lawrence had done nothing but scrutinise his finger nails; he now said:","在索姆斯叙述这件事的过程中，劳伦斯爵士只是仔细地观察着自己的手指甲，这时他说："
"“You had to be told, Elderson.”","“我们必须告诉你这件事，埃尔德森。”"
"“Naturally.”","“当然。”"
"The manager was crossing to the bell.","经理穿过房间去按铃。"
"The pink in his cheeks looked harder; his teeth showed, they had a pointed look.","他双颊上的粉红色显得更深了，他的牙齿露了出来，看起来很尖锐的样子。"
"“Ask Mr. Butterfield to come here.”","“让巴特菲尔德先生到这儿来一下。”"
"There followed a minute of elaborate inattention to each other.","接下来的一分钟，他们故意不去注意彼此。"
"Then the young man came in, neat, commonplace, with his eyes on the manager’s face.","然后那个年轻人进来了，打扮得整洁、平凡，眼睛看着经理的脸。"
"Soames had a moment of compunction.","索姆斯一时间感到有些内疚。"
"This young fellow held his life in his hands, as it were—one of the great army who made their living out of self-suppression and respectability, with a hundred ready to step into his shoes at his first slip.","可以说，这个年轻人把他的生命掌握在他的手中——他是依靠自我克制和受人尊重来谋生的庞大人群中的一员，只要他一犯错误，就会有一百个人来接替他的位置。"
"What was that old tag of the provincial actor’s declamation—at which old Uncle Jolyon used to cackle so?","那个乡下演员朗诵的陈旧的结束语是什么——老乔里恩叔叔过去常常念叨的？"
"“Like a pale martyr with his shirt on fire.”","“就像一个衬衣着了火的面色苍白的殉道者。”"
"“So, Mr. Butterfield, you have been good enough to exercise your imagination in my regard.”","“那么，巴特菲尔德先生，你在关于我的事情上充分发挥想象力了吧。”"
"“No, sir.”","“没有，先生。”"
"“You stick to this fantastic story of eavesdropping?”","“你坚信这个偷听来的荒诞离奇的故事吗？”"
"“Yes, sir.”","“是的，先生。”"
"“We have no further use for your services then.","“那么我们再也用不着你在这里工作了。"
"Good morning!”","再见！”"
"The young man’s eyes, doglike, sought the face of Soames; a string twitched in his throat, his lips moved without a sound.","那个年轻人的眼睛像狗的眼睛一样，寻找着索姆斯的脸，他的喉咙里有根筋在抽搐，嘴唇悄无声息地动了动。"
"He turned and went out.","他转身走了出去。"
"“So much for that,” said the manager’s voice; “HE’LL never get another job.”","“这件事就到此为止吧，”经理说，“他再也找不到工作了。”"
"The venom in those words affected Soames like the smell of Russian fat.","这句话里的恶意就像俄罗斯肥肉的气味一样侵袭着索姆斯。"
"At the same moment he had the feeling: This wants thinking out.","与此同时他感到：这件事要彻底地想一想。"
"Only if innocent, or guilty and utterly resolved, would Elderson have been so drastic.","只有在无辜，或者是有罪且横下一条心的情况下，埃尔德森才会如此过激。"
"Which was he?","他属于哪一种情况呢？"
"The manager went on:","经理继续说："
"“I thank you for drawing my attention to the matter, gentlemen.","“谢谢你们让我注意到这件事，先生们。"
"I have had my eye on that young man for some time.","我注意那个年轻人已经有一段时间了。"
"A bad hat all round.”","他是个彻头彻尾的坏蛋。”"
"Soames said glumly:","索姆斯闷闷不乐地说："
"“What do you make out he had to gain?”","“你觉得他这样做对自己有什么好处呢？”"
"“Foresaw dismissal, and thought he would get in first.”","“他预料到会被解雇，于是就想要先发制人。”"
"“I see,” said Soames.","“我明白了。”索姆斯说。"
"But he did not.","但是他不明白。"
"His mind was back in his own office with Gradman rubbing his nose, shaking his grey head, and Butterfield’s: “No, sir, I’ve nothing against Mr. Elderson, and he’s nothing against me.”","他回想起在自己的办公室里，格雷德曼一边擦着鼻子，一边摇着满头白发的脑袋以及巴特菲尔德说的：“没有，先生，我没有什么针对埃尔德森先生的事情，他也没有什么针对我的事情。”"
"‘I shall require to know more about that young man,’ he thought.","“我需要了解关于那个年轻人的更多的情况。”他想。"
"The manager’s voice again cut through.","经理的声音又一次传入他的耳朵。"
"“I’ve been thinking over what you said yesterday, Mr. Forsyte, about an action lying against the Board for negligence.","“我一直在考虑您昨天说的话，福赛特先生，关于有人会控告董事会失职的问题。"
"There’s nothing in that; our policy has been fully disclosed to the shareholders at two general meetings, and has passed without comment.","这没什么可担心的，我们的方针政策已经在两次股东大会上向股东们充分说明了，而且没有任何异议就通过了。"
"The shareholders are just as responsible as the Board.”","股东们和董事会一样负有责任。”"
"“H’m!” said Soames, and took up his hat.","“呣！”索姆斯说着，拿起了帽子，"
"“Are you coming, Mont?”","“你走吗，蒙特？”"
"As if summoned from a long distance, Sir Lawrence galvanitically refixed his monocle.","仿佛听到了远方的召唤一样，劳伦斯爵士触电似的重新戴上了他的单片眼镜。"
"“It’s been very distasteful,” he said; “you must forgive us, Elderson.","“这件事非常令人不快，”他说，“你必须原谅我们，埃尔德森。"
"You had to be told.","我们不得不告诉你。"
"I don’t think that young man can be quite all there—he had a peculiar look; but we can’t have this sort of thing, of course.","我认为那个年轻人头脑不是很清醒——他的样子很奇怪，但是，当然了，我们不能允许这种事情发生。"
"Good-bye, Elderson.”","再见，埃尔德森。”"
"Placing their hats on their heads simultaneously the two walked out.","他们两个同时戴上帽子，走了出去。"
"They walked some way without speaking.","他们默默地走了一段路。"
"Then Sir Lawrence said:","然后劳伦斯爵士说："
"“Butterfield?","“巴特菲尔德？"
"My brother-inlaw has a head gardener called Butterfield—quite a good fellow.","我的姐夫有一个园丁主管叫巴特菲尔德——是一个非常好的人。"
"Ought we to look into that young man, Forsyte?”","我们是不是应该调查一下那个年轻人，福赛特？”"
"“Yes,” said Soames, “leave him to me.”","“是的，”索姆斯说，“交给我办吧。”"
"“I shall be very glad to.","“我很乐意把这件事交给你。"
"The fact is, when one has been at school with a man, one has a feeling, don’t you know.”","事实是，当一个人和另一个人当过同学以后，对这个人就会有一种感情，你是知道的。”"
"Soames gave vent to a sudden outburst.","索姆斯突然发泄起来。"
"“You can’t trust anyone nowadays, it seems to me,” he said.","“在我看来，如今你谁都不能相信，”他说，"
"“It comes of—well, I don’t know what it comes of.","“这是因为——哦，我也不知道这是因为什么。"
"But I’ve not done with this matter yet.”","但是这件事我不会就此罢手。”"

"Chapter IX","第九章"
"Sleuth","侦探"
"The Hotch-potch Club went back to the eighteen-sixties.","大杂烩俱乐部的历史可以追溯到19世纪60年代。"
"Founded by a posse of young sparks, social and political, as a convenient place in which to smoulder, while qualifying for the hearths of ‘Snooks’, The Remove, The Wayfarers, Burton’s, Ostrich Feather, and other more permanent resorts, the Club had, chiefly owing to a remarkable chef in its early days, acquired a stability and distinction of its own.","它由一群社会上的和政党中的翩翩少年们创办的，是一个韬光养晦的方便去处，以便获得加入“轻蔑”、利姆夫、旅行者、伯顿、鸵鸟羽毛以及其他更为永久的场所的资格。在俱乐部成立初期，它因为有一名非常杰出的厨师而获得了稳固的地位和名声。"
"It still, however, retained a certain resemblance to its name, and this was its attraction to Michael—all sorts of people belonged.","但是，它仍然保持着和它的名字相似的地方，这也是它吸引迈克尔的地方——各色人等一应俱全。"
"From Walter Nazing, and young semi-writers and patrons of the stage, who went to Venice, and talked of being amorous in gondolas, or of how so-and-so ought to be made love to; from such to bottle-brushed demi-generals, who had sat on courts-martial and shot men out of hand for the momentary weaknesses of human nature; from Wilfrid Desert (who never came there now) to Maurice Elderson, in the card-room, he could meet them all, and take the temperature of modernity.","这里有沃尔特·内津以及年轻的兼职作家和舞台赞助人——他们去过威尼斯，谈论着在凤尾船里的恋爱，或者应该如何向某某人求爱；还有嗜酒如命的低级将领们，他们曾坐在军事法庭上，为了人性一时的软弱而立即将人枪毙；还有威尔弗里德·德赛特（现在他再也不来这里了）和莫里斯·埃尔德森。在棋牌室里，他什么人都能见得到，而且还能感受现代事物。"
"He was doing this in the Hotch-potch smoking-room, the late afternoon but one after Fleur had come into his bed, when he was informed:","就在弗勒上了他的床的第二天下午的晚些时候，他正在大杂烩的吸烟室感受现代事物，这时有人通知他："
"“A Mr. Forsyte, sir, in the hall for you.","“先生，有一位福赛特先生在大厅里等你。"
"Not the member we had here many years before he died; his cousin, I think.”","不是生前在我们这里做了许多年会员的那个人，我想，是他的堂兄弟。”"
"Conscious that his associates at the moment would not be his father-inlaw’s ‘dream,’ nor he theirs, Michael went out, and found Soames on the weighing machine.","迈克尔很清楚，此刻他的同伴们不是他的岳父“梦想见到的人”，他的岳父也不是他的同伴们“梦想见到的人”，迈克尔走了出去，发现索姆斯正站在体重计上。"
"“I don’t vary,” he said, looking up.","“我的体重没什么变化，”他说着，抬起头来，"
"“How’s Fleur?”","“弗勒好吗？”"
"“Very well, thank you, sir.”","“很好，谢谢您，先生。”"
"“I’m at Green Street.","“我现在住在格林大街。"
"I stayed up about a young man.","因为一个年轻人，我彻夜未眠。"
"Have you any vacancy in your office for a clerk—used to figures.","你的办公室里有没有职员的空缺——他过去是做账的。"
"I want a job for him.”","我想给他找个工作。”"
"“Come in here, sir,” said Michael, entering a small room.","“请跟我来，先生。”迈克尔说着，走进了一个小房间。"
"Soames followed and looked round him.","索姆斯跟了进去，环顾四周。"
"“What do you call this?” he said.","“你们把这儿叫做什么？”他说。"
"“Well, we call it ‘the grave’; it’s nice and quiet.","“哦，我们把它叫做‘坟墓’，这里又舒服又安静。"
"Will you have a sherry?”","您要来一杯雪利酒吗？”"
"“Sherry!” repeated Soames.","“雪利酒！”索姆斯重复道，"
"“You young people think you’ve invented sherry; when I was a boy no one dreamed of dining without a glass of dry sherry with his soup, and a glass of fine old sherry with his sweet.","“你们年轻人以为雪利酒是你们发明的。在我小时候，要是喝汤的时候没有一杯干雪利酒，吃甜点的时候没有一杯上好的陈年雪利酒，那是不可想象的。"
"Sherry!”","雪利酒！”"
"“I quite believe you, sir.","“我完全相信您的说法，先生。"
"There really is nothing new.","确实没有什么新鲜的。"
"Venice, for instance—wasn’t that the fashion, too; and knitting, and royalties?","例如，威尼斯——以前不也很时尚吗，还有针织品、版税？"
"It’s all cyclic.","一切都是周期性的。"
"Has your young man got the sack?”","您的那个年轻人是不是被解雇了？”"
"Soames stared.","索姆斯盯着他。"
"“Yes,” he said, “he has.","“是的，”他说，“他被解雇了。"
"His name is Butterfield; he wants a job.”","他的名字叫做巴特菲尔德，他想要一份工作。”"
"“That’s frightfully rife; we get applications every day.","“这非常普遍，我们每天都会收到一些求职信。"
"I don’t want to be swanky, but ours is a rather specialised business.","我不想炫耀，但是我们的工作专业性很强。"
"It has to do with books.”","它和书本有关。”"
"“He strikes me as capable, orderly, and civil; I don’t see what more you want in a clerk.","“他给我的印象是有能力、有条理和有礼貌，我不知道你对一个职员还能再要求些什么。"
"He writes a good hand, and, so far as I can see, he tells the truth.”","他写得一手好字，而且，据我所知，他很诚实。”"
"“That’s important, of course,” said Michael; “but is he a good liar as well?","“当然，这很重要，”迈克尔说，“但是他是不是同样善于说谎呢？"
"I mean, there’s more likely to be something in the travelling line; selling special editions, and that kind of thing.","我的意思是，在旅行推销业务中很有可能需要说点儿谎，在销售特别版本的图书以及诸如此类的业务上也是一样。"
"Could you open up about him a bit?","您能再多说一点儿他的情况吗？"
"Anything human is to the good—I don’t say old Danby would appreciate that, but he needn’t know.”","任何优点都好——我不敢说老丹比会懂得这一点，但是他不必知道这件事。”"
"“H’m!","“呣！"
"Well—he—er—did his duty—quite against his interest—in fact, it’s ruination for him.","哦——他——呃——尽了他的职责——对他自己十分不利——事实上，这件事毁了他。"
"He seems to be married and to have two children.”","他好像已经结婚，还有两个孩子。”"
"“Ho, ho!","“嗬，嗬！"
"Jolly!","好啊！"
"If I got him a place, would he—would he be doing his duty again, do you think?”","如果我给他一个职位，您觉得他会不会——他会不会再次尽自己的责任？”"
"“I am serious,” said Soames; “the young man is on my mind.”","“我是认真的，”索姆斯说，“我一直在为这个年轻人操心。”"
"“Yes,” said Michael, ruminative, “the first thing in such a case is to get him on to some one else’s, sharp.","“是啊，”迈克尔沉思着说，“在这种情况下，首先就是要赶快把他交给其他人去操心。"
"Could I see him?”","我能见见他吗？”"
"“I told him to step round and see you to-night after dinner.","“我告诉他今晚吃过晚饭后去见你。"
"I thought you’d prefer to look him over in private before considering him for your office.”","我想你更愿意先单独考查他一下，再考虑能否让他在你的办公室里供职。”"
"“Very thoughtful of you, sir!","“您考虑得真周到，先生！"
"There’s just one thing.","只有一件事。"
"Don’t you think I ought to know the duty he did—in confidence?","您不认为我应该了解一下他究竟尽了什么责任吗——私下了解一下？"
"I don’t see how I can avoid putting my foot into my mouth without, do you?”","如果不了解，我就不知道如何避免做错事，您说呢？”"
"Soames stared at his son-inlaw’s face, where the mouth was wide; for the nth time it inspired in him a certain liking and confidence; it looked so honest.","索姆斯盯着女婿的脸，他的嘴巴很大，这张脸不知多少次在他的心中激起了某种喜爱和信任，他看起来是如此诚恳。"
"“Well,” he said, going to the door and ascertaining that it was opaque, “this is matter for a criminal slander action, so for your own sake as well as mine you will keep it strictly to yourself”; and in a low voice he retailed the facts.","“好吧，”他一边说着，一边走向房门，去确定它不是透明的，“这是个事关刑事诽谤罪的问题，所以为了你自己，也为了我，你必须对此严格保密。”然后他低声把事情详细叙述了一遍。"
"“As I expected,” he ended, “the young man came to me again this morning.","“正如我所料，”最后他说，“这个年轻人今天早上又来找我。"
"He is naturally upset.","他自然心烦意乱。"
"I want to keep my hand on him.","我想要控制住他。"
"Without knowing more, I can’t make up my mind whether to go further or not.","不多了解点儿情况，我就不能下定决心是否继续进行下去。"
"Besides”—Soames hesitated; to claim a good motive was repulsive to him: “I—it seems hard on him.","此外——”索姆斯犹豫了一下，他很反感说自己是出于好心，“我——这件事似乎对他打击很沉重。"
"He’s been getting three hundred and fifty.”","他原本挣350英镑呢。”"
"“Dashed hard!” said Michael.","“够狠的！”迈克尔说，　"
"“I say, Elderson’s a member here.”","“话说，埃尔德森是这里的会员啊。”"
"Soames looked with renewed suspicion at the door—it still seemed opaque, and he said: “The deuce he is!","索姆斯又怀疑地看着门——它看上去仍然是不透明的，于是他说：“他不是才怪呢！"
"Do you know him?”","你认识他吗？”"
"“I’ve played bridge with him,” said Michael; “he’s taken some of the best off me—snorting good player.”","“我和他打过桥牌，”迈克尔说，“他赢了我不少钱——打牌高手。”"
"“Ah!” said Soames—he never played cards himself.","“啊！”索姆斯说——他自己从来不打牌，"
"“I can’t take this young man into my own firm for obvious reasons; but I can trust you.”","“我不能把这个年轻人弄到我的公司里，原因很明显。但是我可以相信你。”"
"Michael touched his forelock.","迈克尔捋了捋前额上的头发。"
"“Frightfully bucked, sir.","“非常荣幸，先生。"
"Protection of the poor—some sleuth, too.","保护穷人——还能当侦探。"
"I’ll see him to-night, and let you know what I can wangle.”","我今晚见见他，然后告诉您我能想出些什么办法。”"
"Soames nodded.","索姆斯点点头。"
"‘Good Gad!’ he thought; ‘what jargon!...’","“天啊！”他想，“多难的事情啊！……”"
"The interview served Michael the good turn of taking his thoughts off himself.","这次会面帮了迈克尔一个大忙，使他不再想着自己的事情。"
"Temperamentally he sided already with the young man Butterfield; and, lighting a cigarette, he went into the card-room.","在情感上他已经站到了那个年轻人巴特菲尔德一边，于是他点上一支烟，走进了棋牌室。"
"Sitting on the high fender, he was impressed—the room was square, and within it were three square card tables, set askew to the walls, with three triangles of card players.","坐在高高的火炉围栏上，他注意到——房间是正方形的，里面摆着三张正方形的牌桌，靠着墙斜着摆放，三个打牌的人围成三个三角形。"
"‘If only,’ thought Michael, ‘the fourth player sat under the table, the pattern would be complete.","“要是，”迈克尔想，“第四个打牌的人坐在桌子底下，这个图案就完整了。"
"It’s having the odd player loose that spoils the cubes.’","正是因为多出了一个打牌人，才破坏了那些立方体。”"
"And with something of a thrill he saw that Elderson was a fourth player!","他看到埃尔德森就是第四个打牌的人，感觉有些兴奋！"
"Sharp and impassive, he was engaged in applying a knife to the end of a cigar.","他正在用一把小刀削掉雪茄的头，表情既精明又冷漠。"
"Gosh! what sealed books faces were!","天啊！人们的脸真的像天书一样啊！"
"Each with pages and pages of private thoughts, interests, schemes, fancies, passions, hopes and fears; and down came death—splosh!—and a creature wiped out, like a fly on a wall, and nobody any more could see its little close mechanism working away for its own ends, in its own privacy and its own importance; nobody any more could speculate on whether it was a clean or a dirty little bit of work.","每个人都有许多页的私密的想法、利益、阴谋、幻想、激情、希望和恐惧。等到死亡降临——哗——于是一个人被消灭了，就像墙上的苍蝇，再也没有人能看到它那细小而紧密的结构，隐秘而又郑重地工作到它生命的尽头，再也没有人能推断出这小小的工作究竟是干净的还是肮脏的。"
"Hard to tell!","很难说！"
"They ran in all shapes!","他们是各色人等一应俱全！"
"Elderson, for instance—was he a nasty mess, or just a lamb of God who didn’t look it?","例如，埃尔德森——他是一个下流险恶的混蛋呢，还是上帝的羔羊呢——只是样子看起来不太像而已？"
"‘Somehow,’ thought Michael, ‘I feel he’s a womaniser.","“不知为何，”迈克尔想，“我觉得他是一个玩弄女人的男人。"
"Now why?’","这是为什么呢？”"
"He spread his hands out behind him to the fire, rubbing them together like a fly that has been in treacle.","他把手伸到背后去烤火，像只落在蜜糖上的苍蝇一样，搓着双手。"
"If one couldn’t tell what was passing in the mind of one’s own wife in one’s own house, how on earth could one tell anything from the face of a stranger, and he one of the closest bits of mechanism in the world—an English gentleman of business!","如果一个人连自己家中的妻子在想什么都不知道，他怎么能从一个陌生人的脸上看出些什么呢，而且这个人又是世界上最严密的机械装置之一——一个做生意的英国绅士！"
"If only life were like ‘The Idiot’ or ‘The Brothers Karamazov,’ and everybody went about turning out their inmost hearts at the tops of their voices!","要是生活像《白痴》或者《卡拉马佐夫兄弟》里写的那样，每一个人都把自己内心深处的想法大声地喊出来，那该多好啊！"
"If only club card rooms had a dash of epilepsy in their composition!","要是俱乐部棋牌室里的人都有一点儿癫痫病，那该多好啊！"
"But—nothing!","但是——没有！"
"Nothing!","什么也没有！"
"The world was full of wonderful secrets which everybody kept to themselves without captions or close-ups to give them away!","这个世界满是令人惊奇的秘密，每一个人都保守着这些秘密，没有字幕或特写镜头可以泄露这些秘密！"
"A footman came in, looked at the fire, stood a moment expressionless as a stork, waiting for an order to ping out, staccato, through the hum, turned and went away.","一个侍者走进来，看着炉火，面无表情地站了一会儿，就像一只等待命令起飞的鹳鸟突然停了下来，在一片嗡嗡声中又转身离开了。"
"Mechanism!","机械装置！"
"Everywhere—mechanism!","到处都是——机械装置！"
"Devices for getting away from life so complete that there seemed no life to get away from.","用于逃离生活的装置是如此完备，以至于似乎没有什么要逃离的生活了。"
"‘It’s all,’ he thought, ‘awfully like a man sending a registered letter to himself.","“这非常像，”他想，“一个人给自己寄了一封挂号信。"
"And perhaps it’s just as well.","或许就是这么一回事。"
"Is ‘life’ a good thing—is it?","‘生活’是美好的吗——是吗？"
"Do I want to see ‘life’ raw again?’","我想看到‘生活’再次回到原始状态吗？”"
"Elderson was seated now, and Michael had a perfect view of the back of his head.","埃尔德森现在坐了下来，迈克尔可以非常清楚地看到他的后脑勺。"
"It disclosed nothing.","什么也看不出来。"
"‘I’m no sleuth,’ he thought; ‘there ought to be something in the way he doesn’t part his hair behind.’","“我不是个侦探，”他想，“他不把后脑勺上的头发分开是有一定的道理的。”"
"And, getting off the fender, he went home.","于是，他从火炉围栏上下来，回家去了。"
"At dinner he caught one of his own looks at Fleur and didn’t like it.","吃晚饭的时候，他看了弗勒一眼，觉得很不舒服。"
"Sleuth!","侦探！"
"And yet how not try to know what were the real thoughts and feelings of one who held his heart, like an accordion, and made it squeak and groan at pleasure!","然而对于一个像控制手风琴一样控制了他的心，可以随心所欲地使它发出尖叫声和呻吟声的人，如何才能做到不想知道她的真实想法和感情呢！"
"“I saw the model you sent Aubrey yesterday,” she said.","“我昨天看见你送给奥布里的那个模特了，”她说，"
"“She didn’t say anything about the clothes, but she looked ever so!","“她没有提衣服的事情，但是从她的表情可以看得出来！"
"What a face, Michael!","多漂亮的脸啊，迈克尔！"
"Where did you come across her?”","你是在哪儿发现她的？”"
"Through Michael sped the thought: ‘Could I make her jealous?’","迈克尔的脑子里闪过一个念头：“我能不能让她妒忌一下呢？”"
"And he was shocked at it.","他对这个念头感到震惊。"
"A low-down thought—mean and ornery!","一个低级的念头——卑鄙下流！"
"“She blew in,” he said.","“她自己突然出现的，”他说，"
"“Wife of a little packer we had who took to snooping—er—books.","“她是我们那儿以前的一个小包装工的妻子，他偷了——呃——书。"
"He sells balloons now; they want money badly.”","他现在在卖气球，他们非常需要钱。”"
"“I see.","“我明白了。"
"Did you know that Aubrey’s going to paint her in the nude?”","你知不知道奥布里打算给她画裸体像？”"
"“Phew!","“唷！"
"No!","不知道！"
"I thought she’d look good on a wrapper.","我本以为把她画在封面上应该看起来不错。"
"I say!","啊呀！"
"Ought I to stop that?”","我是不是应该阻止她那样做？”"
"Fleur smiled.","弗勒笑了。"
"“It’s more money and her look-out.","“那样可以挣更多的钱，而且那是她的事。"
"It doesn’t matter to you, does it?”","这与你无关，不是吗？”"
"Again that thought; again the recoil from it!","那个念头又冒了出来，然后又缩了回去！"
"“Only,” he said, “that her husband is a decent little snipe for a snooper, and I don’t want to be more sorry for him.”","“只是，”他说，“虽然她的丈夫偷了东西，但是他是一个正派的小人物。我不希望他更加难过。”"
"“She won’t tell him, of course.”","“她当然不会告诉他的。”"
"She said it so naturally, so simply, that the words disclosed a whole attitude of mind.","她这句话说得这么自然，这么坦率，完全暴露了她的思想态度。"
"One didn’t tell one’s mate what would tease the poor brute!","一个人是不会跟自己可怜的配偶说些可能惹怒他们的事情的！"
"He saw by the flutter of her white eyelids that she also realised the give-away.","他看到她那白皙的眼皮颤动了一下，就明白她也意识到自己说漏了嘴。"
"Should he follow it up, tell her what June Forsyte had told him—have it all out—all out?","他要不要追究下去，把琼·福赛特对他说的话告诉她——向她摊牌——摊牌？"
"But with what purpose—to what end?","但是这样做的目的是什么呢——会有什么结果呢？"
"Would it change things, make her love him?","这样做会改变情况，让她爱上他吗？"
"Would it do anything but harass her a little more; and give him the sense that he had lost his wicket trying to drive her to the pavilion?","这样做是不是只会使她更加烦恼，并且让他感到自己是偷鸡不成反蚀一把米呢？"
"No!","不行！"
"Better adopt the principle of secrecy she had unwittingly declared her own, bite on it, and grin.","最好还是采取那个使她不知不觉地自我暴露的秘密原则，坚持这个原则，并强颜欢笑。"
"He muttered:","他喃喃地说："
"“I’m afraid he’ll find her rather thin.”","“我怕他会发现她太瘦了。”"
"Her eyes were bright and steady; and again he was worried by that low-down thought: ‘Could he make her—?’","她的眼睛明亮而坚定。他又被那个低级的念头所困扰：“我能不能让她——？”"
"“I’ve only seen her once,” he added, “and then she was dressed.”","“我只见过她一次，”他补充道，“那时她是穿着衣服的。”"
"“I’m not jealous, Michael.”","“我不会妒忌的，迈克尔。”"
"‘No,’ he thought, ‘I wish to heaven you were!’","“不，”他想，“我多么希望你会妒忌啊！”"
"The words: “A young man called Butterfill to see you, sir,” were like the turning of a key in a cell door.","“一个名叫巴特菲的年轻人想要见您，先生。”这句话就像一把在牢门上转动的钥匙。"
"In the hall the young man “called Butterfill” was engaged in staring at Ting-a-ling.","在大厅里，那个“名叫巴特菲”的年轻人正在盯着小叮铃看。"
"‘Judging by his eyes,’ thought Michael, ‘he’s more of a dog than that little Djinn!’","“从他的眼睛来判断，”迈克尔想，“他比那个小精灵更像一只狗！”"

"Now then!","好啦！"
"I know all about the turmoil.","那个乱子我全都知道了。"

"The young man smiled wanly.","年轻人无力地笑了笑。"
"“I don’t know, sir.”","“我不知道，先生。”"
"“Well, look here,” said Michael, carried away by the look in his eyes, “it’s all a question of a certain patter.","“哦，听着，”迈克尔说，他被年轻人的眼神所感动，“这完全是能说会道的问题。"
"But, of course, that’s got to be learned.","但是，当然了，这需要学习。"
"I gather that you’re not a reader.”","我猜你不怎么看书吧。”"
"“Well, sir, not a great reader.”","“嗯，先生，不怎么看。”"

"Part III","第三卷"
"Chapter I","第一章"
"Bank Holiday","公休日"
"Whitsuntide Bank Holiday was producing its seasonal invasion of Hampstead Heath, and among the ascending swarm were two who meant to make money in the morning and spend it in the afternoon.","在降灵节公休日期间，汉普斯蒂荒地的游人络绎不绝。在蜂拥而至的人群中，有两个人打算上午赚一笔，下午就把它花掉。"

"Squeezing his arm, Victorine fingered, through her dress, a slight swelling just above her right knee.","维多琳紧紧握着他的胳膊，同时隔着衣服摸摸右膝上方微微鼓起的地方。"

"They afforded temporary nourishment, till she had the few more pounds needful for their passage-money.","气球生意可以暂时补贴家用，直到她再赚几镑凑足他们的路费。"

"And she smiled.","她笑了。"

"She even talked of it with Tony, who had street-corner knowledge.","她甚至还和托尼谈起过此事，而托尼是有些街头赛马常识的人。"
"Already she had prepared chapter and verse of two imaginary coups; a sovereign made out of stitching imaginary blouses, invested on the winner of the Two Thousand Guineas, and the result on the dead-heater for the Jubilee at nice odds; this with a third winner, still to be selected, would bring her imaginary winnings up to the needed sixty pounds odd she would so soon have saved now out of ‘the altogether.’","她已经设计了两个有理有据的说辞：代人缝制罩衫赚到了一个金币，于是便将它压在“两千几尼马赛”的优胜马身上，结果在狂欢节那天的双头马上，中彩了；这笔钱再加上一匹跑了第三名的马，具体哪匹有待选择，这样她那笔虚构的赢钱就凑够了他们所需的60镑，这笔钱她能从那种“裸体生意”中非常迅速地积蓄起来。"
"This tale she would pitch to Tony in a week or two, reeling off by heart the wonderful luck she had kept from him until she had the whole of the money.","一两周后，等她得到整笔钱，她就把这个虚构的故事讲给托尼听，她已经烂熟于心，可以滔滔不绝地讲述这个幸运的故事。"

"‘Afternoon of a Dryad’ had long been finished, and was on exhibition at the Dumetrius Gallery, with other works of Aubrey Greene.","《林中仙女的午后》早已完成，同奥布里·格林的其他作品一起在杜梅特里斯画廊展出了。"
"Victorine had paid a shilling to see it; had stood some furtive minutes gazing at that white body glimmering from among grass and spikey flowers, at the face, turned as if saying: “I know a secret!”","维多琳花了一先令去看了一下。她偷偷地站了几分钟，凝视着那个闪烁在青草和穗状花朵之间、微微发亮的白皙身体，凝视着那张脸，那张脸转过去仿佛在说：“我知道一个秘密！”"

"Chapter II","第二章"
"Office Work","办公室工作"
"Michael sat correcting the proofs of ‘Counterfeits’—the book left by Wilfrid behind him.","迈克尔坐在那里校对着《赝品》的样张——就是威尔弗里德留下来的那本书。"
"“Can you see Butterfield, sir?”","“您可以接见巴特菲尔德吗，先生？”"
"“I can.”","“可以。”"
"In Michael the word Butterfield excited an uneasy pride.","在迈克尔心里，巴特菲尔德这个词激起了一阵令人不安的自豪感。"
"The young man fulfilled with increasing success the function for which he had been engaged, on trial, four months ago.","这个年轻人四个月前得到试用，此后不断成功地履行了他的职责。"
"The head traveller had even called him “a find.”","那个首席旅行推销员还称他是“一个人才”。"
"Next to ‘Copper Coin’ he was the finest feather in Michael’s cap.","他是迈克尔仅次于《铜币》的最骄人的成就。"
"The Trade were not buying, yet Butterfield was selling books, or so it was reported; he appeared to have a natural gift of inspiring confidence where it was not justified.","同行中人都不买进了，可是据称巴特菲尔德还在卖书。看起来，他有一种天分，可以获得别人无法获得的信任。"
"Danby and Winter had even entrusted to him the private marketing of that vellum-bound ‘Limited’ of ‘A Duet,’ by which they were hoping to recoup their losses on the ordinary edition.","丹比&温特出版社甚至委托他私下销售那本《二重唱》的皮面精装限量版，希望借此弥补平装本的损失。"
"He was now engaged in working through a list of names considered likely to patronise the little masterpiece.","他眼下正忙着拟定一份名单，名单中人都有望为这部小杰作捧场。"
"This method of private approach had been suggested by himself.","这种私下买卖的方式也是他建议的。"
"“You see, sir,” he had said to Michael: “I know a bit about Coue.","“您看，先生，”他对迈克尔说道，“我对库埃的心理暗示理论有所了解。"
"Well, you can’t work that on the Trade—they’ve got no capacity for faith.","可是，对业界同行您不能使用这一理论——因为他们根本没有信仰。"
"What can you expect?","你还能指望什么呢？"
"Every day they buy all sorts of stuff, always basing themselves on past sales.","他们一直以过去的销售情况为依据，每天买进各种各样的东西。"
"You can’t find one in twenty that’ll back the future.","他们20个人里也不会有一个人为未来投资。"
"But with private gentlemen, and especially private ladies, you can leave a thought with them like Coue does—put it into them again and again that day by day in every way the author’s gettin’ better and better; and ten to one when you go round next, it’s got into their subconscious, especially if you take ‘em just after lunch or dinner, when they’re a bit drowsy.","但是，私下向那些有钱人推销，尤其是向有钱的夫人们推销的时候，你可以像库埃那样对他们作心理暗示——并且向他们反复灌输这一观点：这位作家在各个方面的声望会越来越好。这样一来，等你下一次走访的时候，十有八九这一理念已经渗入他们的潜意识中了，尤其是在吃完午餐或是晚餐之后，因为那时候人们的头脑不是那么清醒。"
"Let me take my own time, sir, and I’ll put that edition over for you.”","先生，就让我慢慢地进行吧，我一定会为您把这一版的书都卖出去的。”"
"“Well, Michael had answered, “if you can inspire confidence in the future of my governor, Butterfield, you’ll deserve more than your ten per cent.”","“好吧，”迈克尔答道，“要是你能让人们相信我老板的将来，那么，巴特菲尔德，你应得的就不止百分之十了。”"
"“I can do it, sir; it’s just a question of faith.”","“这我能办到，先生，这只是一个信念问题。”"
"“But you haven’t any, have you?”","“但是你自己是没有信仰的，对吗？”"
"“Well, not, so to speak, in the author—but I’ve got faith that I can give THEM faith in him; that’s the real point.”","“嗯，没错，可以这么说，我不相信作者——但是我相信我可以使人们相信作者。这才是真正的关键所在。”"
"“I see—the three-card stunt; inspire the faith you haven’t got, that the card is there, and they’ll take it.","“我明白了——原来是那种三张纸牌的把戏，你不信但却让别人相信，牌就在那儿，然后他们就会上当的。"
"Well, the disillusion is not immediate—you’ll probably always get out of the room in time.","还好，不会马上就穿帮——你大概总能及时抽身，逃避责任。"
"Go ahead, then!”","那么，就这么做吧！”"
"The young man Butterfield had smiled....","年轻的巴特菲尔德笑了……"
"The uneasy part of the pride inspired in Michael now by the name was due to old Forsyte’s continually saying to him that he didn’t know—he couldn’t tell—there was that young man and his story about Elderson, and they got no further....","现在，这个名字令迈克尔在自豪之余产生不安，是因为老福赛特不停地对他说他不知道——他说不出来——那个年轻人，还有他所说的那个关于埃尔德森的故事是怎么回事，他们没有任何进展……"
"“Good morning, sir.","“早上好，先生。"
"Can you spare me five minutes?”","您能抽出五分钟时间吗？”"
"“Come in, Butterfield.","“进来吧，巴特菲尔德。"

"“What!","“什么！"
"Been over the top?”","你已经和他交过手了吗？”"
"“Yes, sir.","“是的，先生。"
"Last night.”","昨天晚上。”"
"“Good for you, Butterfield!","“干得好，巴特菲尔德！"
"What happened?”","发生什么事了？”"
"“I didn’t send my name in, sir—just the firm’s card.”","“我没有报上自己的名字，先生——我只是递上了公司的名片。”"
"Michael was conscious of a very human malice in the young man’s voice and face.","迈克尔觉得这个年轻人的声音中和面孔上都带有一种人性本有的阴谋。"
"“Well?”","“然后呢？”"
"“Mr. Elderson, sir, was at his wine.","“埃尔德森先生那时正在喝酒，先生。"
"I’d thought it out, and I began as if I’d never seen him before.","我去之前就已经想好了，所以一开始就装成和他素不相识的样子。"
"What struck me was—he took my cue!”","让我吃惊的是——他居然听从了我的建议！”"
"“Didn’t kick you out?”","“他没有把你踢出去？”"
"“Far from it, sir.","“远非如此，先生。"
"He said at once: ‘Put my name down for two copies.’”","他还立刻说道：‘在我名下记上两部。’”"
"Michael grinned.","迈克尔开心地笑道："
"“You both had a nerve.”","“你们两个都够大胆的。”"

"He didn’t like it a little bit.”","他一点儿也不喜欢这样。”"
"“I don’t twig,” said Michael.","“我不明白。”迈克尔说。"
"“My being in this firm’s employ, sir.","“因为我是这个公司的员工，先生。"
"He knows you’re a partner here, and Mr. Forsyte’s son-inlaw, doesn’t he?”","他知道您是公司的合伙人，也是福赛特先生的女婿，对吗？”"
"“He does.”","“不错，他知道。”"
"“Well, sir, you see the connection—two directors believing me—not HIM. That’s why I didn’t miss him out.","“这样，先生，您看出其中的关联了吧——有两个董事相信我——不相信他！"
"I fancied it’d shake him up.","正因为如此，我才没有把他从名单中剔除。"
"I happened to see his face in the sideboard glass as I went out.","我想这会让他大吃一惊的。"
"HE’S got the wind up all right.”","我离开的时候刚好从餐柜的镜子里看到他的脸。"
"Michael bit his forefinger, conscious of a twinge of sympathy with Elderson, as for a fly with the first strand of cob-web round his hind leg.","迈克尔咬咬自己的食指，有点儿同情埃尔德森，觉得他就像一只后腿被蜘蛛网的第一缕蛛丝缠上的苍蝇一样。"
"“Thank you, Butterfield,” he said.","“谢谢你，巴特菲尔德。”他说道。"
"When the young man was gone, he sat stabbing his blotting-paper with a paper-knife.","那个年轻人走后，他坐在那里，拿把裁纸刀戳着吸墨水纸。"
"What curious ‘class’ sensation was this?","这是什么古怪的“阶级”感？"
"Or was it merely fellow-feeling with the hunted, a tremor at the way things found one out?","也许只是对猎物的同情心，或是一种对事情终归会真相大白的战栗？"
"For, surely, this was real evidence, and he would have to pass it on to his father, and ‘Old Forsyte.’","因为，无疑，这是确凿的证据。他会把这情况告诉他父亲和“老福赛特”。"
"Elderson’s nerve must have gone phut, or he’d have said: “You impudent young scoundrel—get out of here!”","埃尔德森的神经肯定崩溃了，不然的话，他会说：“你这无耻的恶棍——给我滚出去！”"

"“Yes, Mr. Mont?”","“有什么事，蒙特先生？”"
"“Now let’s get on with it, Miss Perren.”","“现在，我们继续吧，佩伦小姐。”"
"“‘DEAR SIR JAMES FOGGART,—We have given the utmost consideration to your very interesting—er—production.","“‘尊敬的詹姆士·福加特爵士——我们已经充分考虑了您这部非常有趣的——呃——作品。"
"While we are of opinion that the views so well expressed on the present condition of Britain in relation to the rest of the world are of great value to all—er—thinking persons, we do not feel that there are enough—er—thinking persons to make it possible to publish the book, except at a loss.","我们认为，您就当前英国与世界其他国家关系的现状，发表了观点明确的看法，此见解对于一切——呃——有识之士极具价值。然而，我们觉得并没有足够的——呃——有识之士来使此书得以出版，除非我社赔本出版。"
"The—er—thesis that Britain should now look for salvation through adjustment of markets, population, supply and demand, within the Empire, put with such exceedingly plain speech, will, we are afraid, get the goat of all the political parties; nor do we feel that your plan of emigrating boys and girls in large quantities before they are spoiled by British town life, can do otherwise than irritate a working-class which knows nothing of conditions outside its own country, and is notably averse to giving its children a chance in any other.’”","至于——呃——所谓英国应该在整个帝国范围内调整市场、人口、供需，以寻求解决之道的论点，表述如此坦白，只怕会，激怒所有政党。我们还认为您所提出的将大量儿童移居国外，使其免受英国城市生活污染的计划，也只会惹恼工人阶级。因为他们对于国外的情况一无所知，特别反对让他们的子女到别的国家去。’”"
"“Am I to put that, Mr. Mont?”","“我要把这些都写进去吗，蒙特先生？”"
"“Yes; but tone it in a bit.","“是的，不过语气要婉转些。"
"Er—”","呃——”"
"“‘Finally, your view that the land should be used to grow food is so very unusual in these days, that we feel your book would have a hostile Press except from the Old Guard and the Die-hard, and a few folk with vision.’”","“‘最后，您认为土地应该用于耕种的观点，在这个年代看来，是如此非比寻常。因此我们认为此作品将遭到报界的抨击，只有老保守派、顽固派和若干别具慧眼的人士可能会欣赏此作。’”"
"“Yes, Mr. Mont?”","“还有吗，蒙特先生？”"
"“‘In a period of veering—er—transitions’—keep that, Miss Perren—‘and the airy unreality of hopes that have long gone up the spout’—almost keep that—’any scheme that looks forward and defers harvest for twenty years, must be extraordinarily unpopular.","“‘在一个瞬息万变的——呃——过渡时期里’——记下这一句，佩伦小姐——‘那些虚幻的、不切实际的希望早已破灭’——大概就这么记吧——‘任何长远目标、20年之后才能见到成效的计划都必定是不受欢迎的。"
"For all these reasons you will see how necessary it is for you to—er—seek another publisher.","鉴于上述种种原因，务请阁下——呃——另与其他出版社联系。"
"In short, we are not taking any.","简言之，我方不打算冒任何风险。"
"“‘With—er—’ what you like—’dear Sir James Foggart,","“此致——呃——’随便你怎么写——‘尊敬的詹姆士·福加特爵士"
"“‘We are your obedient servants,","“‘您恭顺的仆人，"
"‘“DANBY AND WINTER.’”","“‘丹比&温特出版社敬上。’”"
"“When you’ve translated that, Miss Perren, bring it in, and I’ll sign it.”","“佩伦小姐，等你把速记整理成书信后，请拿给我看看，我来签字。”"
"“Yes.","“好的。"
"Only, Mr. Mont—I thought you were a Socialist.","只是，蒙特先生——我之前以为您是个社会主义者。"
"This almost seems—forgive my asking?”","这个看起来就像是——请原谅我这么问？”"
"“Miss Perren, it’s struck me lately that labels are ‘off.’","“佩伦小姐，我最近才意识到自己那社会主义者的标签已经‘掉了'。"
"How can a man be anything at a time when everything’s in the air?","在这年头，一切都悬在空中，缥缈不定，一个人能成什么事？"
"Look at the Liberals.","看看那些自由党。"
"They can’t see the situation whole because of Free Trade; nor can the Labour Party because of their Capital levy; nor can the Tories because of Protection; they’re all hag-ridden by catchwords!","因为自由贸易，他们已经无法全面地认清时局；工党也不行，因为他们要征收资本税；保守党为了贸易保护主义，也是一样。他们全都被种种口号弄得头昏脑胀的！"
"Old Sir James Foggart’s jolly well right, but nobody’s going to listen to him.","老詹姆士·福加特爵士的看法完全正确，但是没人去听他的话。"
"His book will be waste paper if anybody ever publishes it.","如果有人出版了他的书，那就是在浪费纸张。"
"The world’s unreal just now, Miss Perren; and of all countries we’re the most unreal.”","现在，全世界都不真实了，佩伦小姐，而我们国家是所有国家中最不切实际的一个。”"
"“Why, Mr. Mont?”","“为什么，蒙特先生？”"
"“Why?","“为什么？"
"Because with the most stickfast of all the national temperaments, we’re holding on to what’s gone more bust for us than for any other country.","还不是因为我们是所有民族中最墨守成规的，至今还坚信那些曾经使我们比任何其他国家都更糟糕的东西。"
"Anyway, Mr. Danby shouldn’t have left the letter to me, if he didn’t mean me to enjoy myself.","无论如何，丹比先生既然让我写这封信，就是为了让我开心一些。"
"Oh! and while we’re about it—I’ve got to refuse Harold Master’s new book.","哦！我们处理这件事的时候——我还得拒绝哈罗德·马斯特的新书。"
"It’s a mistake, but they won’t have it.”","这是个错误，但是他们不肯接受。”"
"“Why not, Mr. Mont?","“为什么不呢，蒙特先生？"
"‘The Sobbing Turtle’ was such a success!”","《啜泣的海龟》可是一部成功之作啊！”"
"“Well, in this new thing Master’s got hold of an idea which absolutely forces him to say something.","“唉，在这部新作里，马斯特先生有了新的想法，这使得他非说点儿什么不可。"
"Winter says those who hailed ‘The Sobbing Turtle’ as such a work of art, are certain to be down on this for that; and Mr. Danby calls the book an outrage on human nature.","温特先生说那些热情拥护《啜泣的海龟》的人们，称其为一部了不起的艺术之作，那么他们一定会因此而对新作不满的。而且丹比先生称此书是对人性的践踏。"
"So there’s nothing for it.","因此，我们对此无能为力。"
"Let’s have a shot:","来吧，咱们试着这么写："
"“‘MY DEAR MASTER,—In the exhilaration of your subject it has obviously not occurred to you that you’ve bust up the show.","“‘尊敬的马斯特先生，——在您酣畅地表现您的主题时，您显然没有意识到您已经毁了自己的表演。"
"In ‘The Sobbing Turtle’ you were absolutely in tune with half the orchestra, and that—er—the noisiest half.","在《啜泣的海龟》一书中，您和乐队中的一半是完全合拍的，而那——呃——是最喧闹的一半。"
"You were charmingly archaic, and securely cold-blooded.","您具有迷人的古风，也冷酷得不可动摇。"
"But now, what have you gone and done?","但是，现在，看看您走到哪儿去了，看看您做了什么？"
"Taken the last Marquesan islander for your hero and put him down in London town!","您把最后一个马克萨斯人选定为主角，还把他放在伦敦城里！"
"The thing’s a searching satire, a real criticism of life.","这部作品是尖锐的讽刺，是对人生实实在在的批判。"
"I’m sure you didn’t mean to be contemporary, or want to burrow into reality; but your subject has run off with you.","我确信您并不想成为现代派，也不想在现实中寻根究底，但是您的主题已经远离您的一贯风格了。"
"Cold acid and cold blood are very different things, you know, to say nothing of your having had to drop the archaic.","您是知道的，冷嘲热讽和冷酷无情是完全不同的，更不用说您不得不放弃的那种古风了。"
"Personally, of course, I think this new thing miles better than ‘The Sobbing Turtle,’ which was a nice little affair, but nothing to make a song about.","当然，我个人认为这部新作远胜于《啜泣的海龟》，那虽然是件精巧的小作品，但是无法让人们激动起来。"
"But I’m not the public, and I’m not the critics.","不过，我既不是大众读者，也不是评论家。"
"The young and thin will be aggrieved by your lack of modernity, they’ll say you’re moralising; the old and fat will call you bitter and destructive; and the ordinary public will take your Marquesan seriously, and resent your making him superior to themselves.","那些年轻而阅历欠缺的人会因这部作品中缺乏现代感而不满，他们会说您是在说教；那些年老而阅历丰富的人会说您尖刻而又消极；而那些普通读者会将您写的马克萨斯人的故事当真，因此怨恨您把这个形象塑造得比他们优秀。"
"The prospects, you see, are not gaudy.","您看，前途堪忧啊。"
"How d’you think we’re going to ‘get away’ with such a book?","您觉得我们该把这样一本书卖给谁呢？"
"Well, we’re not!","好啦，我们不打算出版了！"
"Such is the fiat of the firm.","这是公司的命令。"
"I don’t agree with it.","我不同意这么做。"
"I’d publish it tomorrow; but needs must when Danby and Winter drive.","我真想明天就出版它，但是出版社硬要这么做，我也没办法。"
"So, with every personal regret, I return what is really a masterpiece.","所以，我个人表示万分抱歉，谨将这部真正的杰作寄还。"
"“‘Always yours,","“‘此致敬礼！"
"“‘MICHAEL MONT.’”","“‘迈克尔·蒙特’”"
"“D’you know, Miss Perren, I don’t think you need translate that?”","“知道吗，佩伦小姐，我觉得这些话不需要润色加工了吧？”"
"“I’m afraid it would be difficult.”","“我觉得很难润色加工。”"
"“Right-o, then; but do the other, please.","“好吧，那么，请把另一封信润色一下好了。"
"I’m going to take my wife out to see a picture; back by four.","我要带我的妻子去看画展，四点回来。"
"Oh! and if a little chap called Bicket, that we used to have here, calls any time and asks to see me, he’s to come up; but I want warning first.","对了！要是有个叫比克特的小伙子，他以前在这儿工作过，要求见我，随时都可以让他上来。但是你得提前告诉我一声。"
"Will you let them know downstairs?”","你告诉楼下的人好吗？”"
"“Yes, Mr. Mont.","“好的，蒙特先生。"
"Oh! didn’t—wasn’t that Miss Manuelli the model for the wrapper on Mr. Storbert’s novel?”","哦！会不会——刚才那个曼纽丽小姐就是斯托伯特的小说的封面女郎呢？”"
"“She was, Miss Perren; alone I found her.”","“她就是，佩伦小姐。是我一个人发现她的。”"
"“She’s very interesting-looking, isn’t she?”","“她的容貌很是引人注目，是不是？”"
"“She’s unique, I’m afraid.”","“恐怕她是独一无二的吧。”"
"“She needn’t mind that, I should think.”","“我想她不必担心这个。”"
"“That depends,” said Michael; and stabbed his blotting-paper.","“那可不一定。”迈克尔一边戳着他的吸墨水纸，一边说。"

"Chapter III","第三章"
"‘Afternoon of a Dryad’","《林中仙女的午后》"
"Fleur was still gracefully concealing most of what Michael called ‘the eleventh baronet,’ now due in about two months’ time.","弗勒的体态还是那么优雅，并没有因为怀着孩子而臃肿起来，尽管那个被迈克尔称为“第十一代准男爵”的小家伙还有两个月左右就要降生了。"
"She seemed to be adapting herself, in mind and body, to the quiet and persistent collection of the heir.","她似乎在进行身心两方面的自我调节，以便能够安静而顽强地把这个小继承人生下来。"
"Michael knew that, from the first, following the instructions of her mother, she had been influencing his sex, repeating to herself, every evening before falling asleep, and every morning on waking the words: “Day by day, in every way, he is getting more and more male,” to infect the subconscious which, everybody now said, controlled the course of events; and that she was abstaining from the words: “I WILL have a boy,” for this, setting up a reaction, everybody said, was liable to produce a girl.","迈克尔知道，从一开始，她就遵照她母亲的指示一直在影响胎儿的性别。每天晚上睡觉前以及每天早晨醒来后，她都对自己反复地说：“一天又一天，在每一个方面，他都越来越男性化了。”她寄希望以此能够影响自己的潜意识，因为如今人们都说事情的进程是由潜意识控制的。同时她极力避免说：“我会生一个男孩的。”因为人们认为，这样说会引起一种反应，反而容易生出个女孩来。"
"Michael noted that she turned more and more to her mother, as if the French, or more naturalistic, side of her, had taken charge of a process which had to do with the body.","迈克尔发现，她越来越频繁地向她母亲求助，就好像她的法国血统或是她体内更顺从自然的那一面，已经控制住这个与肉体生长相关的过程了。"
"She was frequently at Mapledurham, going down in Soames’ car, and her mother was frequently in South Square.","她经常坐着索姆斯的车到梅普尔达勒姆去，而她的母亲也经常到南广场来。"
"Annette’s handsome presence, with its tendency to black lace was always pleasing to Michael, who had never forgotten her espousal of his suit in days when it was a forlorn hope.","安妮特那漂亮的仪表、喜欢黑色蕾丝的癖好，向来令迈克尔满意。他从来没有忘记在那段希望渺茫的求婚日子里，她对他的支持和鼓励。"
"Though he still felt only on the threshold of Fleur’s heart, and was preparing to play second fiddle to ‘the eleventh baronet,’ he was infinitely easier in mind since Wilfrid had been gone.","尽管他依旧觉得自己还只是在弗勒的心房门口，而且还要准备屈居“第十一代准男爵”之下，但是自从威尔弗里德走了以后，他的心情还是轻松了不少。"
"And he watched, with a sort of amused adoration, the way in which she focussed her collecting powers on an object that had no epoch, a process that did not date.","于是他怀着一份欢喜、一份爱慕，看着她把慢慢地积攒来的力气集中在一个不受时代限制的目标上，集中在一个不会过时的过程上。"
"Personally conducted by Aubrey Greene, the expedition to view his show at the Dumetrius Gallery left South Square after an early lunch.","在奥布里·格林的亲自带领下，这一行人早早地吃了午饭，离开了南广场，前去杜梅特里斯画廊参观他的画展。"
"“Your Dryad came to me this morning, Aubrey,” said Michael in the cab.","“你的林中仙女今天早晨来找我了，奥布里，”迈克尔在出租车里说，"
"“She wanted me to ask you to put up a barrage if by any chance her husband blows round to accuse you of painting his wife.","“她让我恳求你，如果她的丈夫跑去指责你画他的妻子的话，请你代为掩饰一下。"
"It seems he’s seen a reproduction of the picture.”","看来他已经看到这幅画的复制品了。”"
"“Umm!” murmured the painter: “Shall I, Fleur?”","“嗯！”画家小声地说，“弗勒，我要这样做吗？”"
"“Of course you must, Aubrey!”","“当然了，奥布里，必须！”"
"Aubrey Greene’s smile slid from her to Michael.","奥布里·格林笑着转向了迈克尔。"
"“Well, what’s his name?”","“好吧，他叫什么名字？”"
"“Bicket.”","“比克特。”"
"Aubrey Greene fixed his eyes on space, and murmured slowly:","奥布里·格林两眼盯着空中，慢慢地小声念叨："
"“An angry young husband called Bicket","“一个叫做比克特的年轻的丈夫，"
"Said: ‘Turn yourself round and I’ll kick it;","生气地说：‘转过身去，我要踢你一脚；"
"You have painted my wife","你画了我的老婆，"
"In the nude to the life,","赤身裸体，栩栩如生。"
"Do you think, Mr. Greene, it was cricket?’”","格林先生，你认为这样做光明正大吗？’”"
"“Oh!","“哎呀！"
"Aubrey!”","奥布里！”"
"“Chuck it!” said Michael, “I’m serious.","“别闹了！”迈克尔说，“我是认真的。"
"She’s a most plucky little creature.","她是个很有勇气的小人儿。"
"She’s made the money they wanted, and remained respectable.”","她挣到了他们两人需要的钱，又不失体面。”"
"“So far as I’m concerned, certainly.”","“据我所知，的确如此。”"
"“Well, I should think so.”","“嗯，我也这么认为。”"
"“Why, Fleur?”","“为什么，弗勒？”"
"“You’re not a vamp, Aubrey!”","“你不是个色狼，奥布里！”"
"“As a matter of fact, she excited my aesthetic sense.”","“实际上，她激发了我对美的感受。”"
"“Much that’d save her from some aesthetes!” muttered Michael.","“她可受不了某些唯美主义者！”迈克尔说。"
"“Also, she comes from Putney.”","“而且，她是普特尼人。”"
"“There you have a real reason.","“这才是你真正的理由。"
"Then, you WILL put up a barrage if Bicket blows in?”","那么，要是比克特突然跑来问你，你会替她掩饰了？”"
"Aubrey Greene laid his hand on his heart.","奥布里·格林一只手放在心口："
"“And here we are!”","“都记在这里了！”"
"For the convenience of the eleventh baronet Michael had chosen the hour when the proper patrons of Aubrey Greene would still be lunching.","由于第十一代准男爵带来的不便，迈克尔选择趁着奥布里·格林的普通观众吃午饭的时间来参观。"
"A shock-headed young man and three pale-green girls alone wandered among the pictures.","在画廊里徘徊的只有一个头发蓬乱的年轻人和三个面色青白的小姑娘。"
"The painter led the way at once to his masterpiece; and for some minutes they stood before it in a suitable paralysis.","画家立刻带领他们来到他的那幅杰作面前，然后众人在那幅画前适宜地呆立了几分钟。"
"To speak too soon in praise would never do; to speak too late would be equally tactless; to speak too fulsomely would jar; to mutter coldly: “Very nice—very nice indeed!” would blight.","过早开口称赞是绝对不行的；称赞得太晚也同样不得体；过分的恭维会使人不快；冷淡地说“很好——确实很好！”又会让人失望。"
"To say bluntly: “Well, old man, to tell you the truth, I don’t like it a little bit!” would get his goat.","直截了当地说：“唉，老朋友，说实话，我一点儿也不喜欢它。”这会惹他发火的。"
"At last Michael pinched Fleur gently, and she said:","最后，迈克尔轻轻捏了弗勒一下，于是她说："

"And he had lost the picture!","但他却把这幅图片弄丢了！"
"Yet he had taken nothing out of his pockets—just hung his coat up.","然而他并没有从口袋里拿出过任何东西——只是把大衣挂了起来。"
"Had it joggled out in the crush at the station, or had he missed his pocket opening and dropped it in the carriage?","究竟是在车站拥挤的人群中挤掉了呢，还是没有把它放进口袋里掉在了车厢里了呢？"
"And he had wanted to see the original, too.","而且他还想去看看那幅原画。"
"He remembered that the Gallery began with a ‘D,’ and at lunch-time squandered a penny-halfpenny to look up the names.","他记得那家画廊的名字是以“杜”开头的，于是在吃午饭的时候他花了一个半便士去查找那个名字。"

"Oh! balloons!","哦！气球！"
"They were no good to me!”","它们对我毫无用处！”"

"Almost life-size, among the flowers and spiky grasses, the face smiled round at him—very image of Vic!","几乎和真人一样大，在花朵和穗状的草丛中，那张脸扭过来朝他微笑——完全就是维的肖像！"

"That painter!","那个画家！"
"What business had he to paint a woman so like Vic as that—a woman that didn’t mind lyin’ like that!","他有什么权利去画一个和维那么相像的女人——一个不在乎像那样躺着的女人！"

"It sort of haunted you—it did!","它使你魂牵梦萦——它的确如此！"
"‘Well!’ thought Bicket, ‘I’ll get home to Vic.","“哦！”比克特想，“我还是回家去找维吧。"

"If I was an alderman, I’d buy the blinkin’ thing, and burn it!’","如果我是一个市议员，我就把这个该死的东西买下来，然后烧掉！”"

"Bicket paused in sheer amazement.","比克特十分惊异地停下了脚步。"
"“It’s a rithing name, Mr. Forthyte,” he heard the Dago say: “hith prithes are going up.”","“这个画家的声望越来越高了，福赛特先生，”他听到这个外国佬说，“他的画的价格正在上涨。”"
"“That’s all very well, Dumetrius, but it’s not everybody’s money in these days—too highly-finished, altogether!”","“这些全都很好，杜梅特里斯，但是这年头不是人人都花得起这笔钱——总而言之，太精美了！”"

"And at every woman’s passing face he looked—so different, so utterly unlike Vic’s!","他看着每一个经过的女人的脸——那么不同，完全不像维的脸！"
"When he reached home she was standing in the middle of the room, with her lips to a balloon.","当他到家的时候，她正站在房屋的中间，嘴唇对着一只气球。"
"All around her, on the floor, chairs, table, mantelpiece, were the blown-out shapes of his stock; one by one they had floated from her lips and selected their own resting-places: puce, green, orange, purple, blue, enlivening with their colour the dingy little space.","在她的周围，地板上、椅子上、桌子上、壁炉架上，全都是他那些被吹大了的气球存货。气球一个接一个地从她的唇边漂浮起来，选择它们各自休息的地方：褐色的、绿色的、橙色的、紫色的、蓝色的，它们的颜色使这个昏暗的小地方充满了生气。"
"All his balloons blown up!","他所有的气球都被吹大了！"
"And there, in her best clothes, she stood, smiling, queer, excited.","而她穿着自己最好的衣服，站在那里，微笑着，神情既奇怪又激动。"

"We can pay it back, some day.","有朝一日，咱们可以把钱还给他。"
"Isn’t it a marvel?”","难道这不是个奇迹吗？”"
"Bicket’s eyes, startled like a rabbit’s, took in her smile, her excited flush, and a strange feeling shot through all his body, as if THEY were taking HIM in!","比克特的眼睛，吃惊得像兔子的眼睛似的，看着她的微笑，兴奋的红晕，一种奇怪的感觉贯穿他的全身，仿佛这一切都是在故意欺骗他似的！"

"Bicket kissed; his vertigo was real, but behind it, for the moment stifled, what sense of unreality!...","比克特吻了她，他的头晕是真的，但是暂时压抑在这后面的那种感觉是多么的不真实啊！"
"Was it before night, or in the night, that the doubt first came—ghostly, tapping, fluttering, haunting—then, in the dawn, jabbing through his soul, turning him rigid.","不知是在夜晚之前，还是在夜里，怀疑第一次来袭——幽灵一般地，轻轻地敲打着，颤动着，萦绕心头——然后，在破晓时分，刺穿了他的灵魂，使他变得僵硬。"

"She answered his look—straight, yes, straight.","她回望着他——坦然，是的，很坦然。"
"Oh! he was a proper swine!...","哦！他真是太下流了！……"
"When he had left the house Victorine stood quite still, with hands pressed against her chest.","当他离开家的时候，维多琳一动不动地站在那里，双手按着胸口。"

"Victorine stared back at him.","维多琳目不转睛地看着他。"
"“The rest!” she said—it was not a question, just a repetition, in a voice that seemed to mean nothing.","“其余的事情！”她说——那不是发问，而是将刚才的话重复了一遍，语气和声调似乎不包含任何意义。"

"Chapter VII","第七章"
"Looking into Elderson","调查埃尔德森"
"Soames had left Danby and Winter divided in thought between Elderson and the White Monkey.","索姆斯离开丹比&温特出版社后，心里想着两件事：埃尔德森和《白猿》。"
"As Fleur surmised, he had never forgotten Aubrey Greene’s words concerning that bit of salvage from the wreck of George Forsyte.","像弗勒猜测的一样，他一直记着奥布里·格林看到从乔治·福赛特的那堆废品中抢救出来的那幅画时说的一番话。"
"“Eat the fruits of life, scatter the rinds, and get copped doing it.”","“吃掉人生的果实，果皮随便一丢，正在它这么做的时候，被逮住了。”"
"His application of them tended towards the field of business.","他觉得这句话同样适用于商业买卖中。"
"The country was still living on its capital.","国家依然靠着那点儿资本过活。"
"With the collapse of the carrying trade and European markets, they were importing food they couldn’t afford to pay for.","随着运输业和欧洲市场的萎靡衰退，他们却还在源源不断地进口他们无力支付的食物。"
"In his opinion they would get copped doing it, and that before long.","在他看来，他们会作茧自缚，而且不久就要犯事。"
"British credit was all very well, the wonder of the world and that, but you couldn’t live indefinitely on wonder.","英国的信誉没的可说，而且堪称是世界的奇迹，但是总不能无节制地靠奇迹过日子啊。"
"With shipping idle, concerns making a loss all over the place, and the unemployed in swarms, it was a pretty pair of shoes!","航运业没有生意，企业处处亏损，失业的人成群结队，这才糟糕啊！"
"Even insurance must suffer before long.","很快，即便是保险业也会受到牵连影响的。"
"Perhaps that chap Elderson had foreseen this already, and was simply feathering his nest in time.","也许埃尔德森已经注意到这些现象了，才会及时中饱私囊。"
"If one was to be copped in any case, why bother to be honest?","如果一个人迟早被抓住，那为何伪装得老老实实呢？"
"This was cynicism so patent, that all the Forsyte in Soames rejected it; and yet it would keep coming back.","这明显就是玩世不恭，面对这些，索姆斯身上具有的福赛特气质是绝对容忍不了的。但是它却一再显现。"
"In a general bankruptcy, why trouble with thrift, far-sightedness, integrity?","破产已成大局，何须再为节俭、远见、诚实而劳神费心呢？"
"Even the Conservatives were refusing to call themselves Conservatives again, as if there were something ridiculous about the word, and they knew there was really nothing left to conserve.","甚至连那些保守党人都不再愿意称自己是保守党了，似乎这个词是那么幼稚可笑，他们清楚确实已经没有什么值得他们去保守了。"
"“Eat the fruit, scatter the rinds, and get copped doing it.”","“吃掉果实，果皮随便一丢，正在它这么做的时候，被逮住了。”"
"That young painter had said a clever thing—yes, and his picture was clever, though Dumetrius had done one over the price—as usual!","那位年轻的画家讲了一句聪明的话——是啊，而且他的画也聪明，虽然杜梅特里斯开价过高——像往常一样！"
"Where would Fleur hang it?","弗勒会把画挂在什么地方呢？"
"In the hall, he shouldn’t be surprised—good light there; and the sort of people they knew wouldn’t jib at the nude.","要是挂在门厅，他肯定不感到惊讶——那里光线好。而且他们结识的那帮人是不会对裸体画反感的。"
"Curious—where all the nudes went to!","奇怪——所有那些裸体画都去哪里了！"
"You never saw a nude—no more than you saw the proverbial dead donkey!","你从来没欣赏过裸体画——就像从来没见过谚语里提到的死驴一样！"
"Soames had a momentary vision of dying donkeys laden with pictures of the nude, stepping off the edge of the world.","一时间索姆斯勾勒出一幅几匹奄奄一息的驴驮着那些裸体画，正从世界的边缘走下来的景象。"
"Refusing its extravagance, he raised his eyes, just in time to see St. Paul’s, as large as life.","他不想再胡思乱想，就放眼望去，恰巧看到圣保罗大教堂，就在眼前。"
"That little beggar with his balloons wasn’t there today!","那个卖气球的穷小子今天倒不在那里！"
"Well—he’d nothing for him!","嗯——他也没什么可给他的！"
"At a tangent his thoughts turned towards the object of his pilgrimage—the P. P. R. S. and its half-year’s accounts.","顺着这个思路他的思维转到他这次出行的目的——天佑再保险公司和那半年度的账目。"
"At his suggestion, they were writing off that German business wholesale—a dead loss of two hundred and thirty thousand pounds.","在他的建议下，他们取消了那笔德国的批发生意——这令他们整整亏损了23万镑。"
"There would be no interim dividend, and even then they would be carrying forward a debit towards the next half-year.","期中的股息不会发了，但即便是这样，他们也还得将一笔借记转到下半年度的账目中。"
"Well! better have a rotten tooth out at once and done with; the shareholders would have six months to get used to the gap before the general meeting.","嗯！还是应该把蛀牙立刻拔掉处理一下。那些股东们在开全体股东大会之前还有六个月的时间去慢慢适应。"
"He himself had got used to it already, and so would they in time.","对此，他自己早已习惯，他们到时也会习惯的。"
"Shareholders were seldom nasty unless startled—a long-suffering lot!","股东们除非受了惊吓，否则他们可不会随便惹事的——他们可是一群长期忍受苦难的人！"
"In the board room the old clerk was still filling his inkpots from the magnum.","在董事会的会议室里，那个老办事员依然还在把大墨水瓶的墨水灌到小墨水瓶里去。"
"“Manager in?”","“经理在吗？”"
"“Yes, sir.”","“在，先生。”"
"“Say I’m here, will you?”","“转告一声我已经来了，可以吗？”"
"The old clerk withdrew.","老办事员出去了。"
"Soames looked at the clock.","索姆斯看了看钟表。"
"Twelve!","12点了！"
"A little shaft of sunlight slanted down the wainscotting and floor.","一道细小的斜阳照射到护墙板和地板上。"
"There was nothing else alive in the room save a bluebottle and the tick of the clock; not even a daily paper.","房间里除了有一只青蝇和钟表的滴答声以外，再无其他有生气的东西了，甚至连份日报也没有。"
"Soames watched the bluebottle.","索姆斯看了看那只青蝇。"
"He remembered how, as a boy, he had preferred bluebottles and green-bottles to the ordinary fly, because of their bright colour.","他回想自己的孩提时代，他更喜欢绿蝇和青蝇，而不是那些普通的苍蝇，因为它们有鲜艳的颜色。"
"It was a lesson.","这是个教训。"
"The showy things, the brilliant people, were the dangerous.","那些外表过分华丽的东西和那些才华横溢的人都是危险的。"
"Witness the Kaiser, and that precious Italian poet—what was his name!","看看恺撒和那位金贵的意大利诗人——他叫什么名字来着！"
"And this Jack-o’-lantern of their own!","还有他们自己的这位难以琢磨的人物！"
"He shouldn’t be surprised if Elderson were brilliant in private life.","如果埃尔德森在个人生活方面很出色，他是不会感到惊讶的。"
"Why didn’t the chap come?","为什么这个家伙还没来啊？"
"Was that encounter with young Butterfield giving him pause?","是不是那次和年轻人巴特菲尔德见面让他踌躇了。"
"The bluebottle crawled up the pane, buzzed down, crawled up again; the sunlight stole inward along the floor.","那只青蝇慢慢爬上窗户，嗡嗡地掉下来，又慢慢地爬上去，阳光偷偷地照进来落在地板上。"
"All was vacuous in the board room, as though embodying the principle of insurance: “Keep things as they are.”","这间会议室犹如真空一般，似乎彰显着保险业的原则：“一切维持现状。”"
"‘Can’t kick my heels here for ever,’ thought Soames, and moved to the window.","“我可不能老在这儿等着。”索姆斯一边想着，一边朝窗口走去。"
"In that wide street leading to the river, sunshine illumined a few pedestrians and a brewer’s dray, but along the main artery at the end the traffic streamed and rattled.","在那条通向河边的宽阔大街上，阳光照射的街上有几个行人和一辆运啤酒的汽车，但在大街尽头的主干道上，车辆行人川流不息，喧哗吵闹。"
"London!","伦敦！"
"A monstrous place!","一个怪异的地方！"
"And all insured!","全都上了保险了！"
"‘What’ll it be like thirty years hence?’ he thought.","“30年后这里会变成什么样？”他想。"
"To think that there would be London, without himself to see it!","想到那时伦敦还是伦敦，可是自己却已不在，无法看见了！"
"He felt sorry for the place, sorry for himself.","他为这个地方感到悲哀，为他自己感到悲哀。"
"Even old Gradman would be gone.","甚至老格雷德曼也会去世的。"
"He supposed the insurance societies would look after it, but he didn’t know.","他想那些保险公司会处理后事，但是他自己不知道罢了。"
"And suddenly he became aware of Elderson.","这时，他突然感觉埃尔德森来了。"
"The fellow looked quite jaunty, in a suit of dittoes and a carnation.","这个家伙看上去洋洋得意，穿着一身套装，胸前还带着一朵康乃馨。"
"“Contemplating the future, Mr. Forsyte?”","“福赛特先生，您在思考将来吗？”"
"“No,” said Soames.","“没有。”索姆斯说。"
"How had the fellow guessed his thoughts?","这个家伙怎么会清楚他的心思呢？"
"“I’m glad you’ve come in.","“很高兴您能来。"
"It gives me a chance to say how grateful I am for the interest you take in the concern.","这给了我一个感谢您对公司所付出的辛劳的机会。"
"It’s rare.","难得啊。"
"A manager has a lonely job.”","经理的工作可真是寂寞。”"
"Was he mocking?","他是不是在嘲笑什么？"
"He seemed altogether very spry and uppish.","他看上去一副非常敏捷而又不可一世的样子。"
"Light-heartedness always made Soames suspicious—there was generally some reason for it.","轻松快乐的神情总是令索姆斯怀疑——通常来说这里面肯定有原因。"
"“If every director were as conscientious as you, one would sleep in one’s bed.","“如果每一位董事会成员都像您一样认真地对待工作，那我就可以睡得心安了。"
"I don’t mind telling you that the amount of help I got from the Board before you came on it was—well—negligible.”","我不妨跟您说，您没进董事会之前，我从董事会成员那儿得到的帮助——嗯——简直微乎其微。”"
"Flattery!","奉承！"
"The fellow must be leading up to something!","这家伙一定是想岔开话题！"
"Elderson went on:","埃尔德森继续说："
"“I can say to you what I couldn’t say to any of the others: I’m not at all happy about business, Mr. Forsyte.","“我可以跟您说一些不能跟别人说的话：福赛特先生，公司业务的确不容乐观。"
"England is just about to discover the state she’s really in.”","英国马上就会发现自己的真正处境了。”"
"Faced with this startling confirmation of his own thoughts, Soames reacted.","索姆斯感觉到自己曾经的想法得到了令人惊讶的证实。"
"“No good crying out before we’re hurt,” he said; “the pound’s still high.","“在我们未受到损害之前，抱怨是没用的，”他说，“英镑的价值还是较高的。"
"We’re good stayers.”","我们依旧坚挺。”"
"“In the soup, I’m afraid.","“我担心将会处于困境。"
"If something drastic isn’t done—we SHALL stay there.","如果不采取一些应急措施——我们将会束手无策。"
"And anything drastic, as you know, means disorganisation and lean years before you reap reward.”","而任何的应急措施，就像你所知道的那样，都意味着在你获益之前必定经过瓦解和长期的歉收。”"
"How could the fellow talk like this, and look as bright and pink as a new penny?","这家伙怎么能够一边说着这样的言论，同时又看起来像一枚新便士，红光满面呢？"
"It confirmed the theory that he didn’t care what happened.","这证实了索姆斯的推测，他并不在乎发生了什么。"
"And, suddenly, Soames resolved to try a shot.","于是，索姆斯突然间决定要试探一下。"
"“Talking of lean years—I came in to say that I think we must call a meeting of the shareholders over this dead loss of the German business.”","“说到长期歉收——我倒想说，我觉得咱们有必要召开一次股东大会，分析这笔德国买卖的全部亏损情况。”"
"He said it to the floor, and looked quickly up.","说这话时他低头看着地板，说完又迅速抬起头来。"
"The result was disappointing.","结果令人失望。"
"The manager’s light-grey eyes met his without a blink.","经理那双浅灰色的眼睛碰到他的目光，毫无反应。"
"“I’ve been expecting that from you,” he said.","“我早就料到您会提出这个意见。”他说。"
"‘The deuce you have!’ thought Soames, for it had but that moment come into his mind.","“该死的早就料到！”索姆斯心想，因为这个想法是他刚刚才想到的。"
"“By all means call one,” went on the manager; “but I’m afraid the Board won’t like it.”","“无论怎样，都要召开一次，”经理继续说，“不过我担心董事会不喜欢这种做法。”"
"Soames refrained from saying: ‘Nor do I.’","索姆斯忍住没有说出：“我也不喜欢。”"
"“Nor the shareholders, Mr. Forsyte.","“福赛特先生，股东们也不会喜欢的。"
"In a long experience I’ve found that the less you rub their noses in anything unpleasant, the better for every one.”","根据以往的经验，我发现告诉他们不愉快的事情越少，对大家越有好处。”"
"“That may be,” said Soames, stiffening in contrariety; “but it’s all a part of the vice of not facing things.”","“也许吧，”索姆斯因为听到了与之对立的言论而变得倔强，说道，“但这完全是逃避事实的陋习。”"
"“I don’t think, Mr. Forsyte, that you will accuse ME of not facing things, in the time to come.”","“福赛特先生，我想您将来不会埋怨我没有面对事实吧。”"
"Time to come!","将来！"
"Now, what on earth did the fellow mean by that?","现在，这家伙说这话是什么意思？"
"“Well, I shall moot it at the next Board,” he said.","“嗯，我将在下次董事会上提出讨论此事。”他说。"
"“Quite!” said the manager.","“太棒了！”经理说，"
"“Nothing like bringing things to a head, is there?”","“没有什么能够比得上把事情开诚布公地讲出来，不是吗？”"
"Again that indefinable mockery, as if he had something up his sleeve.","又是那种难以形容的嘲笑，似乎他在袖口里揣着绝招妙计。"
"Soames looked mechanically at the fellow’s cuffs—beautifully laundered, with a blue stripe; at his holland waistcoat, and his bird’s-eye tie—a regular dandy.","索姆斯机械地看看那家伙的袖口——洗烫得很漂亮，上面有一条蓝色的条纹；他又看看他那洁白亚麻细布的背心，还有那条鸟眼花纹的领带——简直就是一个花花公子。"
"He would give him a second barrel!","他还要再攻击他一次！"
"“By the way,” he said, “Mont’s written a book.","“顺便说一句，”他说，“蒙特写了本书。"
"I’ve taken a copy.”","我买了一本。”"
"Not a blink!","毫无反应！"
"A little more show of teeth, perhaps—false, no doubt!","他只微露出牙齿，或许——是假的，毫无疑问！"
"“I’ve taken two—poor, dear Mont!”","“我买了两本——可怜的、亲爱的蒙特！”"
"Soames had a sense of defeat.","索姆斯有一种溃败的感觉。"
"This chap was armoured like a crab, varnished like a Spanish table.","这个家伙把自己武装得像一只螃蟹，光滑得像一张西班牙式的桌子。"
"“Well,” he said, “I must go.”","“好的，”他说，“我得走了。”"

"It undermined him.","用握手来削弱他的意志。"
"And yet, it might be the crown of a consummate bit of acting.","或许用握手预示这次完美的表演圆满结束。"
"He couldn’t tell.","他说不清了。"
"He had, however, less intention even than before of moving for a meeting of the shareholders.","不管怎样，相比以前，他更加不愿提议召开股东大会了。"
"No, no!","不，不！"
"That had just been a shot to get a rise; and it had failed.","刚才只是想激一下他，结果却失败了。"
"But the Butterfield shot had gone home, surely!","不过巴特菲尔德那一下肯定是击中了！"
"If innocent, Elderson must certainly have alluded to the impudence of the young man’s call.","如果他真是清白的，埃尔德森一定会提起那个年轻人拜访他是多么厚颜无耻。"
"And yet such a cool card was capable of failing to rise, just to tease you!","然而竟无法激怒这样一个可恶的家伙，反而让他戏弄了一番！"
"No!","不！"
"Nothing doing—as they said nowadays.","不行——就像人们现在说的那样。"
"He was as far as ever from a proof of guilt; and to speak truth, glad of it.","他还是跟以前一样，让人抓不到一点儿把柄，而且说实话，反而为此很高兴。"
"Such a scandal could serve no purpose save that of blackening the whole concern, directors and all.","这样的丑闻，除了让整个公司、董事们和大家难堪之外，没有什么意义。"
"People were so careless, they never stopped to think, or apportion blame where it was due.","人们向来漠不关心，从来不停下来思考，或者分清是非得失。"
"Keep a sharp eye open, and go on as they were!","提高警觉，一切顺其自然！"
"No good stirring hornets’ nests!","树敌结怨没有好处！"
"He had got so far in thought and progress, when a voice said:","他一边入神地想着，一边走着，突然有人对他说："
"“Well met, Forsyte!","“福赛特，幸会！"
"Are you going my way?”","你是来找我吗？”"
"“Old Mont,” coming down the steps of ‘Snooks’!","“老蒙特”此时正从“轻蔑”俱乐部的台阶上走下来！"

"“How d’you mean, Michael?”","“何出此言呢，迈克尔？”"
"“Well, look at the Nature novels we get.","“唉，看看我们得到的几部描写‘大自然’的小说。"
"Sedulous stuff pitched on Cornish cliffs or Yorkshire moors—ever been on a Yorkshire moor?—it comes off on you; and the Dartmoor brand.","以科尼什山崖或约克郡荒野为背景，写一些依样画葫芦的东西——你曾经去过约克郡荒野吗？只要你见过，就会对它印象深刻的，还有达特穆尔高原特色的东西。"

"After all, old Wordsworth made Nature, and she’s a bromide.","毕竟，老华兹华斯创立了自然派，不过它是一帖镇静剂。"
"Of course, there’s raw nature with the small ‘n’; but if you come up against that, it takes you all your time to keep alive—the Nature we gas about is licensed, nicely blended and bottled.","当然，还有以小写字母“n”开头的原始的自然派，如果接触到那种自然派的话，你就要用毕生的精力来保全生命——至于我们胡扯的这个‘大自然’，它已经领了许可证，调制得恰到好处，并且装进瓶里了。"
"She’s not modern enough for contemporary style.”","不过就当代的风格而言，它还不够时髦。”"
"“Oh! well, let’s go on the river, anyway, Michael.","“哦！好吧，不管怎样，咱们还是去河边吧，迈克尔。"
"We can have tea at ‘The Shelter.’”","我们可以在‘棚屋’里喝点儿茶。”"
"They were just reaching what Michael always called ‘this desirable residence,’ when Fleur leaned forward, and, touching his knee, said:","他们刚到被迈克尔称作“这个称心如意的住处”，弗勒就俯身向前，碰碰他的膝盖，说道："
"“I’m not half as nice to you as you deserve, Michael.”","“我对你还没有你对我的一半好呢，迈克尔。”"
"“Good Lord, darling!","“天啊，亲爱的！"
"I thought you were.”","我觉得你对我很好。”"
"“I know I’m selfish; especially just now.”","“我知道我很自私，特别是现在。”"
"“It’s only the eleventh baronet.”","“那只是第十一代准男爵的缘故。”"
"“Yes; it’s a great responsibility.","“是，这是一个重大的责任。"
"I only hope he’ll be like you.”","我只希望他将来能像你。”"
"Michael slid in to the landing-stage, shipped his sculls, and sat down beside her.","迈克尔把船浮到了码头上，把双桨放入船内，然后，在她身边坐下。"
"“If he’s like me, I shall disown him.","“如果他像我，我应该否认他是我的孩子。"
"But sons take after their mothers.”","儿子总是像母亲的。”"
"“I meant in character.","“我指的是在性格方面。"
"I want him frightfully to be cheerful and not restless, and have the feeling that life’s worth while.”","我希望他活得快快乐乐而不浮躁，同时还要拥有真爱人生的情感。”"
"Michael stared at her lips—they were quivering; at her cheek, slightly browned by the afternoon’s sunning; and, bending sideways, he put his own against it.","迈克尔望着她的双唇——它们正在颤动；凝视她的脸颊，在午后的阳光下，脸颊呈现出棕褐色；然后，他侧身弯下去，把自己的脸贴在她的脸上。"
"“He’ll be a sunny little cuss, I’m certain.”","“他一定会是快乐的小家伙，我敢肯定。”"
"Fleur shook her head.","弗勒摇摇头。"
"“I don’t want him greedy and self-centred; it’s in my blood, you know.","“我不希望他贪婪或以自我为中心。你知道那是我血统里有的。"
"I can see it’s ugly, but I can’t help it.","我知道这是丑恶的，但是我无能为力。"
"How do you manage not to be?”","你怎么能做到不这样呢？”"
"Michael ruffled his hair with his free hand.","迈克尔用另一只手弄乱了自己的头发。"
"“The sun isn’t too hot for you, is it, ducky?”","“现在的阳光可以么，晒不晒，亲爱的？”"
"“No. Seriously, Michael—how?”","“不晒，说真的，迈克尔——你怎么做到的？”"
"“But I AM. Look at the way I want you.","“我其实是这样的人。想想我追你时的样子。"
"Nothing will cure me of that.”","什么都挡不住我。”"
"A slight pressure of her cheek on his own was heartening, and he said:","她用脸颊轻轻压了他的脸颊一下，这给了他鼓励，于是他接着说："
"“Do you remember coming down the garden one night, and finding me in a boat just here?","“你还记得那天晚上吗？就是你从花园里出来，发现我就在这儿的一条小船里？"
"When you’d gone, I stood on my head, to cool it.","那天你走后，我就头朝下倒立着，让自己头脑清醒一下。"
"I was on my uppers; I didn’t think I’d got an earthly—” He stopped.","当时我处于困境中，以为自己没希望了——”他停住了。"
"No!","不！"
"He would not remind her, but that was the night when she said: “Come again when I know I can’t get my wish!”","他不想唤起她对往事的回忆，但就是那天晚上，她说：“等我知道我无法实现自己的愿望时再来吧！”"
"The unknown cousin!","那个未曾相识的表哥！"
"Fleur said quietly:","弗勒平静地说："
"“I was a pig to you, Michael, but I was awfully unhappy.","“我对你太不好了，迈克尔，但是我当时非常不开心。"
"That’s gone.","都过去了。"
"It’s gone at last; there’s nothing wrong now, except my own nature.”","终于过去了，现在，除了我自己的性情之外，没什么问题了。”"
"Conscious that his feelings betrayed the period, Michael said:","迈克尔认为现在不是表露情感的时候，于是说道："
"“Oh! if that’s all!","“噢！那就好！"
"What price tea?”","喝点儿茶怎么样？”"
"They went up the lawn arm-inarm.","他们手挽手走上草坪。"
"Nobody was at home—Soames in London, Annette at a garden party.","家里没人——索姆斯在伦敦，安妮特出去参加园游会了。"
"“We’ll have tea on the verandah, please,” said Fleur.","“我们在阳台上喝茶，好吗？”弗勒说。"
"Sitting there, happier than he ever remembered being, Michael conceded a certain value to Nature, to the sunshine stealing down, the scent of pinks and roses, the sighing in the aspens.","迈克尔坐在那里，感觉到了从未有过的快乐。他不禁承认万物各有各的价值，那是大自然悄悄投射下的阳光，还有石竹花和玫瑰的香气以及白杨树丛中的叹息声。"
"Annette’s pet doves were cooing; and, beyond the quietly-flowing river, the spires of poplar trees rose along the further bank.","安妮特的宠物鸽子正咕咕地叫着，在静静流淌的河流那边，白杨树耸立在较远的河流两岸。"
"But, after all, he was only enjoying them because of the girl beside him, whom he loved to touch and look at, and because, for the first time, he felt as if she did not want to get up and flutter off to some one or something else.","但是，毕竟，因为有这位他如此深爱的姑娘在身边，他才会欣赏眼前的一切，而且，还因为他第一次感觉到她似乎不想从他身边飞走投入到其他人或其他事的怀抱。"
"Curious that there could be, outside oneself, a being who completely robbed the world of its importance, ‘snooped,’ as it were, the whole ‘bag of tricks’—and she one’s own wife!","奇怪的是，除了他自己之外，还有一个人使这个世界变得不再重要，好像“拆穿了”整个“西洋镜”——这个人就是他的妻子！"
"Very curious, considering what one was!","其实仔细想想，这真是件奇妙的事！"
"He heard her say:","他听见她说："

"“I think having no religion makes one feel that nothing matters.”","“我认为一个人没有宗教信仰会对什么事都不在乎。”"
"Michael suppressed the words: ‘We could bring him up as a sun-worshipper,’ and said, instead:","迈克尔忍住没说这句话：“我们可以把他培养成太阳崇拜者。”而是改口说："
"“It seems to me that whatever he’s taught will only last till he can think for himself; then he’ll settle down to what suits him.”","“依我看，无论教他什么，都只能在他具有独立思考能力之前进行，之后他自己就会做适合自己的事。”"
"“But what do YOU think about things, Michael?","“可是你是怎么看的呢，迈克尔？"
"You’re as good as any one I know.”","你可不比我认识的任何一个人差啊。”"
"“Gosh!” murmured Michael, strangely flattered: “Is that so?”","“哦！”迈克尔感到特别荣幸，低声道：“真是这样吗？”"
"“What DO you think?","“你怎么想的？"
"Be serious!”","我是认真的！”"
"“Well, darling, doctrinally nothing—which means, of course, that I haven’t got religion.","“嗯，亲爱的，从教义上说什么也没有——当然，这是说我没有宗教信仰。"
"I believe one has to play the game—but that’s ethics.”","我认为一个人必须正大光明——不过这只是道德标准。”"
"“But surely it’s a handicap not to be able to rely on anything but oneself?","“可是，一个人除了自己之外就没有别的依靠了，也没什么好处吧？"
"If there’s something to be had out of any form of belief, one might as well have it.”","如果从某个宗教信仰中还能得到什么，那么，还是有信仰的好。”"
"Michael smiled, but not on the surface.","迈克尔觉得好笑，但是没有表现出来。"
"“You’re going to do just as you like about the eleventh baronet, and I’m going to abet you.","“对于第十一代准男爵，你喜欢怎样培养就怎样培养吧，总之，我支持你。"
"But considering his breeding—I fancy he’ll be a bit of a sceptic.”","但是，就他的血统而言——我认为他多少带有怀疑论者的特点。”"
"“But I don’t WANT him to be.","“但我不想他成为这样的人。"
"I’d rather he were snug, and convinced and all that.","我宁愿他生活舒适，信仰宗教等等。"
"Scepticism only makes one restless.”","怀疑论者只会使人不安定。”"
"“No white monkey in him?","“他身上没有白猿的气息吗？"
"Ah!","啊！"
"I wonder!","我想知道！"
"It’s in the air, I guess.","我觉得这很难说。"
"The only thing will be to teach him a sense of other people, as young as possible, with a slipper, if necessary.”","唯一的办法就是从小教育他要关心他人，越早越好，如果有必要，可以用拖鞋打。”"
"Fleur gave him a clear look, and laughed.","弗勒看了他一眼，笑了起来。"
"“Yes,” she said: “Mother used to try, but father wouldn’t let her.”","“是的。”她说，“母亲常这样做，可是父亲不同意。”"
"They did not reach home till past eight o’clock.","过了8点，他们才回到家。"
"“Either your father’s here, or mine,” said Michael, in the hall; “there’s a prehistoric hat.”","“不是你父亲在这里，就是我父亲在这里。”迈克尔在门厅里说，“那儿有一顶古老不堪的帽子。”"
"“It’s Dad’s.","“是我爸爸的。"
"His is grey inside.","他那顶是灰色衬里的。"
"Bart’s is buff.”","准爵爷的那顶是浅黄色的。”"
"In the Chinese room Soames indeed was discovered, with an opened letter, and Ting-a-ling at his feet.","不出所料，他们在那间中国式的房间里发现了索姆斯，他手里握着一封拆开的信，小叮铃在他的脚旁。"
"He held the letter out to Michael, without a word.","他一言不发地把信递给了迈克尔。"
"There was no date, and no address; Michael read:","信上没有日期，也没有地址。迈克尔读道："
"“DEAR MR. FORSYTE.—Perhaps you will be good enough to tell the Board at the meeting on Tuesday that I am on my way to immunity from the consequences of any peccadillo I may have been guilty of.","“亲爱的福赛特先生——烦请您在下周二的会议上告知董事会，我已经脱身而去，不承担可能因我的过错给公司带来的损失了。"
"By the time you receive this, I shall be there.","您收到这封信时，我已经到达那里了。"
"I have always held that the secret of life, no less than that of business, is to know when not to stop.","我一直认为人生的秘密和做生意一样，就是知道什么时候不该停下来。"
"It will be no use to proceed against me, for my person will not be attachable, as I believe you call it in the law, and I have left no property behind.","对我起诉没有用，因为你们逮不到我，我相信你们在法律上是这么说的吧，同时我也没留下任何财产。"
"If your object was to corner me, I cannot congratulate you on your tactics.","如果您想把我逼得走投无路，那我对您的策略不敢苟同。"
"If, on the other hand, you inspired that young man’s visit as a warning that you were still pursuing the matter, I should like to add new thanks to those which I expressed when I saw you a few days ago.","从另一方面说，如果您鼓动那个年轻人来访问我，作为您继续追究此事的一个警告，那我除了几天前见到您时对您表示感谢以外，我还愿意再次向您表示感谢。"
"“Believe me, dear Mr. Forsyte,","“相信我，亲爱的福赛特先生，"
"“Faithfully yours,","“您忠实的，"
"“ROBERT ELDERSON.”","“罗伯特·埃尔德森。”"
"Michael said cheerfully:","迈克尔高兴地说："
"“Happy release!","“愉快的解脱！"
"Now you’ll feel safer, sir.”","现在您会感到安全些了，先生。”"
"Soames passed his hand over his face, evidently wiping off its expression.","索姆斯用手摸了摸脸，显然是想把脸上的表情抹掉。"
"“We’ll discuss it later,” he said.","“这件事情我们以后再谈吧。”他说，"
"“This dog’s been keeping me company.”","“这条狗一直和我做伴。”"
"Michael admired him at that moment.","此时，迈克尔很敬佩他。"
"He was obviously swallowing his ‘grief,’ to save Fleur.","很显然，他怕弗勒不舒服，才硬把苦水往肚里咽。"
"“Fleur’s a bit tired,” he said.","“弗勒有点儿累了。”他说，"
"“We’ve been on the river, and had tea at ‘The Shelter’; Madame wasn’t in.","“我们到河上去了，还在‘棚屋’喝了茶。夫人不在家。"
"Let’s have dinner at once, Fleur.”","我们马上吃晚饭吧，弗勒。”"
"Fleur had picked up Ting-a-ling, and was holding her face out of reach of his avid tongue.","弗勒已经把小叮铃抱起来了，还和它保持一段距离，这样它贪婪的舌头不至于碰到她的脸。"
"“Sorry you’ve had to wait, Dad,” she murmured, behind the yellow fur; “I’m just going to wash; shan’t change.”","“很抱歉，让您久等了，爸爸。”她在小叮铃的黄色皮毛后面低声说道，“我去梳洗一下就行，不换衣服了。”"
"When she had gone, Soames reached for the letter.","她走之后，索姆斯伸手来拿信。"
"“A pretty kettle of fish!” he muttered.","“真是乱七八糟!”他抱怨道，"
"“Where it’ll end, I can’t tell!”","“这事结局会怎样，我也说不好！”"
"“But isn’t this the end, sir?”","“但这不就是结局吗，先生？”"
"Soames stared.","索姆斯瞪着眼睛。"
"These young people!","这些年轻人！"
"Here he was, faced with a public scandal, which might lead to he didn’t know what—the loss of his name in the city, the loss of his fortune, perhaps; and they took it as if—!","他陷入这种境地，面对一桩公众热议的丑事，会造成什么样的后果，他也不清楚——也许会让他在伦敦身败名裂，倾家荡产。而他们却把这似乎当作——"
"They had no sense of responsibility—none!","他们没有责任感——一点儿没有！"
"All his father’s power of seeing the worst, all James’ nervous pessimism, had come to the fore in him during the hour since, at the Connoisseur’s Club, he had been handed that letter.","在鉴赏家俱乐部收到这封信后，他父亲的预测最恶劣情况的能力以及詹姆士神经质的悲观主义，都在他的脑海里激荡着。"
"Only the extra ‘form’ of the generation that succeeded James saved him, now that Fleur was out of the room, from making an exhibition of his fears.","只是因为詹姆士沿袭了他们这代人行事更加“拘谨”的特质，所以在弗勒离开房间后，他仍未表露出一丝忧郁。"

"“I believe so, sir.”","“我想是的，先生。”"
"“Good!”","“好！”"
"Not that he felt relief.","他并未因此松了口气。"
"That baronet chap was just as irresponsible—getting him to go on that Board!","准男爵也是个不负责任的家伙——把他弄进那个董事会里！"
"It all came of mixing with people brought up in a sort of incurable levity, with no real feeling for money.","这全是因为他们从小混迹于那些轻率、无可救药的人，一起长大，才闹出这档事，他们根本不知道财富来之不易。"
"“Now that Elderson’s levanted,” he said, “the whole thing must come out.","“既然埃尔德森已经举债出逃了，”他说，“就不得不把整件事揭露出来。"
"Here’s his confession in my hand—”","他的自供状就在我手里——”"
"“Why not tear it up, sir, and say Elderson has developed consumption?”","“为什么不把它撕掉，先生，就说埃尔德森患了肺结核呢？”"
"The impossibility of getting anything serious from this young man afflicted Soames like the eating of heavy pudding.","这个年轻人做什么事都表现出不认真的态度，这让索姆斯像吃了不消化的布丁一样苦恼不堪。"
"“You think that would be honourable?” he said grimly.","“你认为那样做是光明正大的吗？”他厉声说道。"
"“Sorry, sir!” said Michael, sobered.","“抱歉，先生！”迈克尔头脑清醒了一些，说道，"
"“Can I help at all?”","“有什么我可以帮忙的吗？”"
"“Yes; by dropping your levity, and taking care to keep wind of this matter away from Fleur.”","“有。丢掉你轻率处事的态度，不能让弗勒听到有关此事的任何风吹草动。”"
"“I will,” said Michael, earnestly: “I promise you.","“我一定做到。”迈克尔真诚地说，“我向您保证。"
"I’ll Dutch-oyster the whole thing.","我会像荷兰牡蛎那样把这件事密封住。"
"What’s your line going to be?”","您打算采取什么方针呢？”"
"“We shall have to call the shareholders together and explain this dicky-dealing.","“我得召集股东，向大家解释这笔靠不住的买卖。"
"They’ll very likely take it in bad part.”","他们很可能会因此大闹一场。”"
"“I can’t see why they should.","“我不明白他们为什么要闹。"
"How could you have helped it?”","您有什么办法吗？”"
"Soames sniffed.","索姆斯嗤之以鼻。"
"“There’s no connection in life between reward and your deserts.","“人生中，报酬和应得的赏罚之间没有什么联系。"
"If the war hasn’t taught you that, nothing will.”","如果大战还没教会你这个，那么没什么事情会让你明白了。”"
"“Well,” said Michael, “Fleur will be down directly.","“哦。”迈克尔说，“弗勒就要下来了。"
"If you’ll excuse me a minute; we’ll continue it in our next.”","请您原谅，我们有机会再谈吧。”"
"Their next did not occur till Fleur had gone to bed.","直到弗勒上床睡觉了，他们才有机会继续谈。"
"“Now, sir,” said Michael, “I expect my governor’s at the Aeroplane.","“好了，先生。”迈克尔说，“我猜我爸爸应该在飞机俱乐部呢。"
"He goes there and meditates on the end of the world.","他到那冥想世界末日去了。"
"Would you like me to ring him up, if your Board meeting’s tomorrow?”","如果你们明天召开董事会的话，用不用我给他打个电话？”"
"Soames nodded.","索姆斯点点头。"
"He himself would not sleep a wink—why should ‘Old Mont’?","他自己是睡不好觉了——为什么就让“老蒙特”睡个安稳觉呢？"
"Michael went to the Chinese tea chest.","迈克尔朝那个中式茶柜走去。"
"“Bart?","“准爵爷吗？"
"This is Michael.","我是迈克尔。"
"Old For—my father-inlaw is here; he’s had a pill....","老福——我岳父在这呢，他遇到一件讨厌的事……"
"No; Elderson.","不，是埃尔德森。"
"Could you blow in by any chance and hear?...","您能否来听听？"
"He’s coming, sir.","他一会儿就来，先生。"
"Shall we stay down, or go up to my study?”","我们是在这等呢，还是上楼去我的书房？”"
"“Down,” muttered Soames, whose eyes were fixed on the white monkey.","“在楼下吧。”索姆斯轻声说，他盯着那只白猿，"
"“I don’t know what we’re all coming to,” he added, suddenly.","“我不知道我们会落到什么地步。”他突然又说了一句。"
"“If we did, sir, we should die of boredom.”","“先生，如果我们知道的话，我们会很无聊的。”"
"“Speak for yourself.","“这是为你自己辩护。"
"All this unreliability!","一切都靠不住！"
"I can’t tell where it’s leading.”","我真不知道之后的生活会变成什么样。”"
"“Perhaps there’s somewhere, sir, that’s neither heaven nor hell.”","“也许还有某个地方，先生，那里既不是天堂，也不是地狱。”"
"“A man of HIS age!”","“一个他那样年纪的人！”"
"“Same age as my dad; it was a bad vintage, I expect.","“和我爸爸同龄，这是个坏家伙，我想。"
"If you’d been in the war, sir, it would have cheered you up no end.”","如果您参加过大战，先生，您会永远乐观向上的。”"
"“Indeed!” said Soames.","“的确！”索姆斯说。"
"“It took the linch-pins out of the cart—admitted; but, my Lord! it did give you an idea of the grit there is about, when it comes to being up against it.”","“战争把车轴都卸掉了——这我承认。但是，我的天哪！当你面临极大困难时，它确实能让你有更大的勇气。”"
"Soames stared.","索姆斯瞪着眼睛。"
"Was this young fellow reading him a lesson against pessimism?","这小子是不是想借克服悲观主义而教训他一顿？"
"“Look at young Butterfield, the other day,” Michael went on, “going over the top, to Elderson!","“看看那天那个年轻人巴特菲尔德吧。”迈克尔继续说，“他果断地去找了埃尔德森！"
"Look at the girl who sat for ‘the altogether’ in that picture you bought us!","看看您给我们买的那幅‘裸体’画里做模特的姑娘！"
"She’s the wife of a packer we had, who got hoofed for snooping books.","她是我们以前雇佣的一个包装工的老婆，那个包装工因偷书而被开除了。"
"She made quite a lot of money by standing for the nude, and never lost her wicket.","她当裸体画模特挣了一笔钱，却从未失掉自己的尊严。"
"They’re going to Australia on it.","他们靠这笔钱到澳大利亚去了。"
"Yes, and look at that little snooper himself; he snooped to keep her alive after pneumonia, and came down to selling balloons.”","对了，再看看那个小偷本人，他为了让她能在患过肺结核后活下去才去偷书的，结果沦落到卖气球的境地。”"
"“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” said Soames.","“我不明白你在讲些什么东西。”索姆斯说。"
"“Only grit, sir.","“就是坚韧的勇气，先生。"
"You said you didn’t know what we were coming to.","您刚才说不知道我们会沦落到何种地步。"
"Well, look at the unemployed!","嗯，看看那些失业的人！"

"I get awfully bucked at being English every now and then.","我常常为自己是个英国人而感到勇气倍增呢。"
"Don’t you?”","您呢？”"
"The words stirred something deep in Soames; but, far from giving it away, he continued to gaze at the white monkey.","这句话触动了索姆斯内心的某些东西，但是，他丝毫没有表露出来，他依旧凝视着白猿。"
"The restless, inhuman, and yet so human, angry sadness of the creature’s eyes!","这畜生的双眼不安定，无人性，却又如此通人情，愤怒而悲哀！"
"‘No whites to them!’ thought Soames: ‘that’s what does it, I expect!’","“那双眼睛一点儿眼白也没有！”索姆斯心想，“原因就在于此吧，我想！”"
"And George had liked that picture to hang opposite his bed!","而乔治却喜欢把这幅画挂在床的对面！"

"Very English, all the Forsytes!","所有福赛特家的人都是十足的英国人！"
"Old Uncle Jolyon, and his way with shareholders; Swithin, upright, puffy, huge in a too little arm-chair at Timothy’s: ‘All these small fry!’ he seemed to hear the words again; and Uncle Nicholas, whom that chap Elderson reproduced as it were unworthily, spry and all-there, and pretty sensual, but quite above suspicion of dishonesty.","老乔里恩叔叔和他对付股东们的办法；斯悦辛，笔挺地坐在蒂莫西家的那把小扶手椅里，这使他的身材显得更加臃肿，嘴里说着：“所有这些小娃娃们！”他仿佛又听到了这句话；还有尼古拉叔叔，埃尔德森那家伙就像是他的翻版，其实他不配，因为尼古拉机敏、好色，但绝没有一点儿不诚实。"
"And old Roger, with his crankiness, and German mutton!","还有老罗杰和他那古怪的脾气，以及德国羊肉！"
"And his own father, James—how he had hung on, long and frail as a reed, hung on and on!","还有他的父亲，詹姆士——他是多么能坚持，尽管他身材瘦弱得像一根芦秆，但还是一再坚持了！"

"Grit and body in those old English boys, in spite of their funny ways.","在老一辈英国人的身上，尽管有些可笑的作风，但是他们拥有勇气和身体。"
"And there stirred in Soames a sort of atavistic will-power.","这时，似乎唤起了索姆斯体内隔代遗传的意志力。"
"He would see, and they would see—and that was all about it!","他想看看，他们也想看看——事情就是如此！"
"The grinding of a taxi’s wheels brought him back from reverie.","一辆出租车的刹车声使他从沉思中惊醒。"
"Here came ‘Old Mont,’ tittuppy, and light in the head as ever, no doubt.","“老蒙特”大摇大摆地走进来，毋庸置疑，他还和以前一样头脑简单。"
"And, instead of his hand, Soames held out Elderson’s letter.","索姆斯没有把手伸过去，而是把埃尔德森的那封信递给他。"

"The odd contortions of that baronet’s face were giving him some pleasure—the fellow seemed to be feeling it, after all.","准男爵古怪别扭的样子溢于言表，这让他有了一点儿快感。——毕竟，这家伙也感觉到这事情的严重性了。"
"“I should think he’s really gone to escape his women, Forsyte.”","“我倒认为他是想避开那两个女人才出走的，福赛特。”"
"The chap was incorrigible!","这家伙真是不可救药！"
"Soames shrugged his shoulders almost violently.","索姆斯使劲耸了耸肩膀。"
"“You’d better realise,” he said, “that the fat is in the fire.”","“你最好能明白。”他说，“事情已经被搞糟了。”"
"“But surely, my dear Forsyte, it’s been there ever since the French occupied the Ruhr.","“不过可以肯定，我亲爱的福赛特，自从法国人侵占了鲁尔之后，局势一直就是这样。"
"Elderson has cut his lucky; we appoint some one else.","埃尔德森已经出逃了，我们再任命其他人吧。"
"What more is there to it?”","此外还有什么呢？”"
"Soames had the peculiar feeling of having overdone his own honesty.","索姆斯有一种感觉，自己好像老实过头了。"
"If an honourable man, a ninth baronet, couldn’t see the implications of Elderson’s confession, were they really there?","如果一个正派的人，第九代准男爵，都看不出埃尔德森自白中的暗示，那么是不是真的有暗示这回事呢？"
"Was any fuss and scandal necessary?","任何混乱或绯闻都有必要吗？"
"Goodness knew, HE didn’t want it!","老天为证，他不希望这样！"
"He said heavily:","他悲伤地说："
"“We now have conclusive evidence of a fraud; we KNOW Elderson was illegally paid for putting through business by which the shareholders have suffered a dead loss.","“我们现在已经掌握了一个诈骗犯的确凿证据，我们还了解到埃尔德森在成交生意中获得了非法佣金，然而股东们却因此蒙受了极大损失。"

"I’m not prepared to run the risks of concealment.","我不准备冒隐瞒不报的风险。"
"If we conceal, we’re accessory after the fact.","如果我们隐瞒不报，我们就是这件事的从犯了。"
"The thing might come out at any time.”","这件事随时都有可能被泄露出去。”"
"If that was caution, not honesty, he couldn’t help it.","如果只是出于谨慎，而不是忠诚，那他也没辙了。"
"“I should be glad to spare Elderson’s name.","“我觉得如果能保全埃尔德森的名誉是最好了。"
"We were at—”","我们曾经在——”"
"“I’m aware of that,” said Soames, drily.","“这我知道。”索姆斯冷冷地说。"
"“But what risk is there of its coming out, Forsyte?","“可是这件事有什么泄露出去的危险呢，福赛特？"
"Elderson won’t mention it; nor young Butterfield, if you tell him not to.","埃尔德森不会提的，如果你不提小巴特菲尔德的话，他也不会说的。"
"Those who paid the commission certainly won’t.","那些付佣金的人当然更不会提的。"
"And beyond us three here, no one else knows.","这样，除了我们三人之外，再没人知道了。"
"It’s not as if we profited in any way.”","不管怎样，我们似乎不会从这件事上得到好处吧。”"
"Soames was silent.","索姆斯沉默不语了。"
"The argument was specious.","这个论据有点儿似是而非。"
"Entirely unjust, of course, that he should be penalised for what Elderson had done!","当然，要他为埃尔德森做的事受罚，完全不合情理！"
"“No,” he said, suddenly, “it won’t do.","“不。”他突然说，“这样不行。"
"Depart from the law, and you can’t tell where it’ll end.","违反了法律，那你就不知道将来会落到什么下场了。"
"The shareholders have suffered this loss, and they have the right to all the facts within the directors’ knowledge.","股东们已经蒙受了损失，他们有权知道董事们知道的一切事实。"
"There might be some means of restitution they could avail themselves of.","或许会有能为他们做出赔偿的办法。"
"We can’t judge.","我们无法判断。"
"It may be they’ve a remedy against ourselves.”","说不定他们会提出一个补救的办法。”"
"“If that’s so, Forsyte, I’m with you.”","“如果是那样的话，福赛特，我和你站在一起。”"
"Soames felt disgust.","索姆斯感到很厌烦。"
"Mont had no business to put it with a sort of gallantry that didn’t count the cost; when the cost, if cost there were, would fall, not on Mont, whose land was heavily mortgaged, but on himself, whose property was singularly realisable.","蒙特根本不配摆出一副豪侠的样子，却不去计算一下损失，如果有损失，需要为此负担的话，也不会落在蒙特身上，因为他的土地已经被抵押了，反而债务会落在自己的身上，因为他的财产很容易变成现款。"
"“Well,” he said, coldly, “remember that tomorrow.","“好吧。”他冷冷地说，“明天可要记住这件事。"
"I’m going to bed.”","我准备上床睡觉了。”"
"At his open window upstairs he felt no sense of virtue, but he enjoyed a sort of peace.","在楼上，他站在打开的窗子旁，他并未感到自己做了一件善事，但是他享受着安宁带来的快乐。"
"He had taken his line, and there it was!","他采取了自己的方针，就照这样去办！"

"Chapter IX","第九章"
"Soames Doesn’t Give a Damn","索姆斯毫不在乎"
"During the month following the receipt of Elderson’s letter, Soames aged more than thirty days.","收到埃尔德森那封信后的一个月里，索姆斯老了不少。"
"He had forced his policy of disclosure on a doubting Board, the special meeting had been called, and, just as, twenty-three years ago, pursuing divorce from Irene, he had to face the public eye, so now he suffered day and night in dread of that undiscriminating optic.","他已经迫使充满怀疑的董事会接受了他提出的揭露事实真相的方针，同时还发出了召开特别会议的通知。正如23年前，为了争取与伊琳离婚，他不得不在大庭广众面前颜面扫地一样，这一回他寝食难安，害怕众人是非不分的目光。"
"The French had a proverb: “Les absents ont toujours tort!” but Soames had grave doubts about it.","法国人有一句谚语：“不在场的人总是错的！”但是，索姆斯对这句话持怀疑态度。"
"Elderson would be absent from that meeting of the shareholders, but—unless he was much mistaken—he himself, who would be present, would come in for the blame.","埃尔德森不会出席这次股东大会了，但是——除非是他犯了很大错误——即便是他亲自出席，也会备受责备。"
"The French were not to be relied on.","法国人靠不住。"
"What with his anxiety about Fleur, and his misgiving about the public eye, he was sleeping badly, eating little, and feeling below par.","他为弗勒的担忧，同时为公众的看法感到不安，吃不好，睡不好，感觉很不舒服。"
"Annette had recommended him to see a doctor.","安妮特曾经劝他去看看医生。"
"That was probably why he did not.","大概就是因为这个，他才不去的。"
"Soames had faith in doctors for other people; but they had never—he would say—done anything for HIM, possibly because, so far, there had not been anything to do.","索姆斯对医生给别人看病很有信心，但是医生们从来没有——他说——为他做过任何事，可能因为到目前为止，还没有什么事情可做。"
"Failing in her suggestion, and finding him every day less sociable, Annette had given him a book on Coue.","安妮特由于自己的建议未被接受，同时又发现他越来越难以接近，就给了他一本论述库埃的书。"
"After running it through, he had meant to leave it in the train, but the theory, however extravagant, had somehow clung to him.","他匆匆看过后，本想把这本书丢在火车上，可这个理论，不管它如何不合理，不知为什么总是缠着他。"
"After all, Fleur was doing it; and the thing cost you nothing: there might be something in it!","毕竟，弗勒正在用此疗法，而且这又没花你一分钱，这里面讲的或许有点儿道理！"
"There was.","或许有道理。"
"After telling himself that night twenty-five times that he was getting better and better, he slept so soundly that Annette, in the next room, hardly slept at all.","那天夜里，他默念了25遍自己会越来越好之后，竟然睡得酣畅淋漓，他的鼾声甚至打扰了隔壁房间里的安妮特，让她无法入睡。"
"“Do you know, my friend,” she said at breakfast, “you were snoring last night so that I could not hear the cock crow.”","“你知道吗，我的朋友。”吃早饭时，她说，“昨天夜里你的鼻鼾声很响，我连鸡叫声都没听见。”"
"“Why should you want to?” said Soames.","“你为什么要听见鸡叫声呢？”索姆斯说。"
"“Well, never mind—if you had a good night.","“好了，没关系——只要你晚上睡得好就行。"
"Was it my little Coue who gave you that nice dream?”","是不是我给你的那本小书《库埃》让你睡得那么香呢？”"
"Partly from fear of encouraging Coue, and partly from fear of encouraging her, Soames avoided a reply; but he had a curious sense of power, as if he did not care what people said of him.","索姆斯怕鼓励《库埃》，也怕鼓励她，所以他避而不答。然而好像有种神奇的力量，他好像并不介意别人说什么了。"
"‘I’ll do it again to-night,’ he thought.","“今天晚上接着这么干。”他心想。"
"“You know,” Annette went on, “you are just the temperament for Coue, Soames.","“你知道，”安妮特接着说，“你的性格恰好适合库埃疗法，索姆斯。"
"When you cure yourself of worrying, you will get quite fat.”","等你治好了忧虑的老毛病，你的身体就会胖起来。”"
"“Fat!” said Soames, looking at her curves.","“胖！”索姆斯看了看她的曲线，"
"“I’d as soon grow a beard.”","“我宁可留一把胡子。”"
"Fatness and beards were associated with the French.","肥胖和胡须总是与法国人联系在一起。"
"He would have to keep an eye on himself if he went on with this—er—what was one to call it?","他必须得好好照顾自己，如果他继续练这个——呃——人们会叫它什么呢？"
"Tomfoolery was hardly the word to conciliate the process, even if it did require you to tie twenty-five knots in a bit of string: very French, that, like telling your beads!","无聊的玩意一词实在不足以表达这一过程，甚至书中还要求你在一小段绳子上打25个结，这是地道的法国式做法，就像数念珠祷告似的！"
"He himself had merely counted on his fingers.","他只用手指来计数。"
"The sense of power lasted all the way up to London; he had the conviction that he could sit in a draught if he wanted to, that Fleur would have her boy all right; and as to the P. P. R. S.—ten to one he wouldn’t be mentioned by name in any report of the proceedings.","他深信自己的力量，这种感觉一路维持到伦敦。他深信，只要他愿意，即使他坐在风口浪尖也无所谓，他也深信弗勒一定会母子平安的，至于在天佑再保险公司里——十之八九他的名字不会再出现在大会的任何报告中。"
"After an early lunch and twenty-five more assurances over his coffee, he set out for the city.","早午饭之后，他在喝咖啡时又做了25次祈祷，便动身到城里去了。"
"This Board, held just a week before the special meeting of the shareholders, was in the nature of a dress rehearsal.","这次董事会，刚好在股东特别大会前一周举行，实际上是一场预演。"
"The details of confrontation had to be arranged, and Soames was chiefly concerned with seeing that a certain impersonality should be preserved.","对质的种种细节必须安排好，索姆斯主要关注保护那些与个人无关的方针。"
"He was entirely against disclosure of the fact that young Butterfield’s story and Elderson’s letter had been confided to himself.","他完全反对公开以下事实，即年轻人巴特菲尔德的告发和埃尔德森的那封信都是透露给他本人的。"
"The phrase to be used should be a “member of the Board.”","应该采用措辞“一个董事会成员”。"
"He saw no need for anything further.","他认为没必要进一步声明了。"
"As for explanations, they would fall, of course, to the chairman and the senior director, Lord Fontenoy.","至于解释，当然应该向董事长和资格最老的董事福坦诺勋爵询问了。"
"He found, however, that the Board thought he himself was the right person to bring the matter forward.","然而，他却发现董事会却认为他是提出这件事最适合的人选。"
"No one else—they said—could supply the personal touch, the necessary conviction; the chairman should introduce the matter briefly, then call on Soames to give the evidence within his knowledge.","他们说——除了他之外，没人具有和他们接触的机会以及提供具有说服力的证据；董事长会简要介绍一下此事，然后请索姆斯提供他所知的证据。"
"Lord Fontenoy was emphatic.","福坦诺勋爵强烈要求这样做。"
"“It’s up to you, Mr. Forsyte.","“这事全仰仗您了，福赛特先生。"
"If it hadn’t been for you, Elderson would be sitting there today.","要不是您的话，埃尔德森今天还坐在这里呢。"
"From beginning to end you put the wind up him; and I wish the deuce you hadn’t.","从开始到现在，他一直都害怕您，我希望您没做什么。"
"The whole thing’s a confounded nuisance.","这真是一件麻烦事儿。"
"He was a very clever fellow, and we shall miss him.","他是个聪明人，我们会想他的。"
"Our new man isn’t a patch on him.","我们的新经理可比不上他。"
"If he did take a few thou. under the rose, he took ‘em off the Huns.”","如果他私下里确实捞了几千镑，那也是从德国佬那拿的。”"
"Old guinea-pig!","这只老豚鼠！"
"Soames replied, acidly:","索姆斯尖声说道："
"“And the quarter of a million he’s lost the shareholders, for the sake of those few thou.?","“难道他为了这几千镑可以让股东们失掉25万镑吗？"
"Bagatelle, I suppose?”","请问这是小事吗？”"
"“Well, it might have turned out a winner; for the first year it did.","“嗯，说不定它会变成一笔赚钱的生意呢，第一年就是这样的。"
"We all back losers sometimes.”","我们都会把赌注压在输者的身上。”"
"Soames looked from face to face.","索姆斯一一打量他们的面孔。"
"They did not support this blatant attitude, but in them all, except perhaps ‘Old Mont’s,’ he felt a grudge against himself.","他们并不赞成把此事闹大，而且从他们的表情来看，除了“老蒙特”之外，他感觉到每个人都对他有怨恨之情。"
"Their expressions seemed to say: ‘Nothing of this sort ever happened till you came on the Board.’","他们的表情似乎在说：“你没来董事会之前，从没发生过这类事情。”"
"He had disturbed their comfort, and they disliked him for it.","他扰乱了他们的安逸，所以他们并不喜欢他。"
"They were an unjust lot!","他们是一帮不公道的家伙！"
"He said doggedly:","他固执地说："
"“You leave it to me, do you?","“你们都把这件事踢给我，是不是？"
"Very well!”","很好！”"
"What he meant to convey—or whether he meant to convey anything, he did not know; but even that ‘old guinea-pig’ was more civil afterwards.","他这句话要表达什么意思——或者他是否有什么意思要表达，他自己也不清楚，不过之后，就连那只“老豚鼠”也客气些了。"
"He came away from the Board, however, without any sense of power at all.","然而，从董事会出来以后，他已经感觉不到任何力量了。"
"There he would be on Tuesday next, bang in the public eye.","下周二，他就要在公众面前现眼了。"
"After calling to enquire after Fleur, who was lying down rather poorly, he returned home with a feeling of having been betrayed.","弗勒因为不舒服一直躺在床上，他去看过她之后，就直接回家了，心里有种被出卖的感觉。"
"It seemed that he could not rely, after all, on this fellow with his twenty-five knots.","看来，这种打25个结的心理疗法不适合他。"
"However much better he might become, his daughter, his reputation, and possibly his fortune, were not apparently at the disposition of his subconscious self.","不管他现在的状态变得有多好，他的女儿、他的名誉，可能还有他的财产，显然都不是那个下意识所能控制的。"
"He was silent at dinner, and went up afterwards to his picture gallery, to think things over.","吃晚饭时，他默不作声，吃完就到楼上的画廊去了，仔细考虑一下整件事情。"
"For half an hour he stood at the open window, alone with the summer evening; and the longer he stood there, the more clearly he perceived that the three were really one.","他在打开的窗前，站了半个小时，在这夏日的傍晚，独自一人。在窗前站的时间越长，他就越意识到这三件事其实是一回事、。"
"Except for his daughter’s sake, what did he care for his reputation or his fortune?","如果不是为了女儿，他还计较什么名誉和财产呢？"
"His reputation!","他的名誉！"
"Lot of fools—if they couldn’t see that he was careful and honest so far as had lain within his reach—so much the worse for them!","这帮蠢货——如果他们看不出他在力所能及的范围内表现出来的谨慎和诚实——那他们就无药可救了！"
"His fortune—well, he had better make another settlement on Fleur and her child at once, in case of accidents; another fifty thousand.","他的财产——嗯，他最好还是马上再给弗勒和她的孩子一笔财产，以防意外。再给五万镑。"
"Ah! if she were only through her trouble!","啊！只要她能顺利分娩就好！"
"It was time Annette went up to her for good; and there was a thing they called twilight sleep.","现在是时候让安妮特进城到她那里去了，还有一种人们称作半麻醉无痛分娩的方法。"
"To have her suffering was not to be thought of!","可千万不能让她受苦啊！"
"The evening lingered out; the sun went down behind familiar trees; Soames’ hands, grasping the window-ledge, felt damp with dew; sweetness of grass and river stole up into his nostrils.","夜晚悄悄降临，太阳隐没在熟悉的树林后。索姆斯紧紧握着窗框的双手已被露水打湿了，他闻到了青草伴着河水的香气。"
"The sky had paled, and now began to darken; a scatter of stars came out.","此刻，苍茫的天色逐渐暗淡，天空中繁星点点。"
"He had lived here a long time, through all Fleur’s childhood—best years of his life; still, it wouldn’t break his heart to sell.","他在这里住过很长一段时间，陪弗勒度过整个童年时光——这是他一生中最美好的时光。尽管如此，卖掉这处房产也不会让他伤心。"
"His heart was up in London.","他的心已经飞向伦敦了。"
"Sell?","卖了它？"
"That was to run before the hounds with a vengeance.","这未免太心急了。"
"No—no!—it wouldn’t come to THAT!","不——不！事情还没到那个地步！"
"He left the window and, turning up the lights, began the thousand and first tour of his pictures.","他离开窗户，打开电灯，第一千零一次巡视自己的藏画。"
"He had made some good purchases since Fleur’s marriage, and without wasting his money on fashionable favourites.","弗勒结婚以来，他买进好几件便宜货，而且没把钱浪费在追赶那些时髦的作品上。"
"He had made some good sales, too.","他也做过几笔好买卖。"
"The pictures in this gallery, if he didn’t mistake, were worth from seventy to a hundred thousand pounds; and, with the profits on his sales from time to time, they stood him in at no more than five-and-twenty thousand—not a bad result from a life’s hobby, to say nothing of the pleasure!","在他画廊里的那些画，要是没算错的话，值七万到十万镑。同时，若将时不时地卖出所获的利润算进去，这些画的成本还不到两万五千镑——一生的业余爱好有这样的成果总算不赖，更不用说其中的乐趣了！"
"Of course, he might have taken up something else—butterflies, photography, archaeology, or first editions; some other sport in which you backed your judgment against the field, and collected the results; but he had never regretted choosing pictures.","当然，他本来可能会对其他事物产生兴趣——如蝴蝶、摄影、考古，或者书籍首发本，或者在某项运动中下赌注而后收获结果。但他从未对自己选择收藏画而后悔。"
"Not he!","他才不后悔呢！"
"More to show for your money, more kudos, more profit, and more risk!","自己花的钱，可以给别人看更多东西，自己还能从中取得更大的名声、更多的利润，同时也会冒更大的风险！"
"The thought startled him a little; had he really taken to pictures because of the risk?","这种想法使他有点儿吃惊。他是因为要承担风险才喜欢画吗？"
"A risk had never appealed to him; at least, he hadn’t realised it, so far.","风险对他而言向来是没有吸引力的，至少到目前为止他还没认识到这一点。"
"Had his ‘subconscious’ some part in the matter?","是不是他的“潜意识”在这件事上起过一些作用呢？"
"He suddenly sat down and closed his eyes.","他突然坐下来，闭上眼睛。"
"Try the thing once more; very pleasant feeling, that morning, of not “giving a damn”; he never remembered having it before!","再来一遍那玩意试试看。那天早晨，有过一种“毫不在乎”的愉快感觉，他记得以前从来没有过这种感觉！"
"He had always felt it necessary to worry—kind of insurance against the worst; but worry was wearing, no doubt about it, wearing.","他一直觉得担心是必要的——像是一种对最恶劣情况的保险。但是担心令人疲惫，毫无疑问，令人疲惫。　"
"Turn out the light!","把灯关了！"
"They said in that book, you had to relax.","书里说，必须要放松。"
"In the now dim and shadowy room, with the starlight, through many windows, dusted over its reality, Soames, in his easy chair, sat very still.","此刻，这个房间朦胧而幽暗，星光透过窗口洒落在屋内，索姆斯静静地坐在安乐椅上，一动不动。"
"A faint drone rose on the words: “fatter and fatter” through his moving lips.","只有他嘴唇在颤抖，发出一种轻微深沉的嗡嗡声：“越来越胖。”"
"‘No, no,’ he thought: ‘that’s wrong!’","“不，不。”他想，“念错了！”"
"And he began the drone again.","于是他又发出嗡嗡声。"
"The tips of his fingers ticked it off; on and on—he would give it a good chance.","他的指尖在数着念句的次数；念了又念——他要给这种疗法一个好机会。"
"If only one needn’t worry!","但愿自己不必忧虑担心了！"
"On and on—“better and better!”","念了又念——“越来越好！”"
"If only—!","但愿——！"
"His lips stopped moving; his grey head fell forward into the subconscious.","他的嘴唇停止了颤动；他那灰白的脑袋垂在胸前，陷入了下意识。"
"And the stealing starlight dusted over him, too, a little unreality.","此时，悄然射入的星光洒在他身上，有点儿虚无缥缈。"

"Chapter X","第十章"
"But Takes No Chances","但是不冒险"
"Michael knew nothing of the City; and, in the spirit of the old cartographers: “Where you know nothing, place terrors,” made his way through the purlieus of the Poultry, towards that holy of holies, the offices of Cuthcott, Kingson and Forsyte.","迈克尔根本不了解伦敦城，于是他本着老制图员的精神：“警惕那些你不了解的地方”，穿过家禽街的边缘，走向那个最神圣的地方——卡斯考特、金森和福赛特事务所。"
"His mood was attuned to meditation, for he had been lunching with Sibley Swan at the Cafe C’rillon.","他此刻的状态适合思考问题，因为他刚刚在克里伦咖啡馆和西伯莱·斯旺用过午饭。"
"He had known all the guests—seven chaps even more modern than old Sib—save only a Russian so modern that he knew no French and nobody could talk to him.","他认识所有在那里用餐的客人——有七个人甚至比老西伯还要入时——只有一个俄国人除外，他太新潮了竟然不懂法语，以至于没有人能和他交谈。"
"Michael had watched them demolish everything, and the Russian closing his eyes, like a sick baby, at mention of any living name....","迈克尔看着他们吃光了所有的东西，看到只要有人提起任何一个尚在人世的人时，那个俄国人就会像一个病婴似的闭上眼睛……"
"‘Carry on!’ he thought, several of his favourites having gone down in the melee.","“继续吧！”他想道，有几个他最喜欢的人物已经在混乱的讨论中被否定了，"
"‘Stab and bludge!","“中伤吧！调侃吧！"
"Importance awaits you at the end of the alley.’","等着身后留名吧。”"
"But he had restrained his irreverence till the moment of departure.","但是他一直忍着，直到他要走的时候才把这些无礼的话说出来。"
"“Sib,” he said, rising, “all these chaps here are dead—ought they to be about in this hot weather?”","“西伯，”他站起来说，“这里的这些家伙都是死人——天气这么热他们怎么能出来活动呢？”"
"“What’s that?” ejaculated Sibley Swan, amidst the almost painful silence of the chaps.","“你说的是什么话？”在一帮人基本上都尴尬无语的时候，西伯莱·斯旺突然喊道。"
"“I mean—they’re alive—so they MUST be damned!”","“我是说——他们都还活着——所以他们都该见鬼去！”"
"And avoiding a thrown chocolate which hit the Russian, he sought the door.","他躲过一块扔过来的巧克力，夺门而出，结果那块巧克力打中了那个俄国人。"
"Outside, he mused: ‘Good chaps, really!","出门后，他若有所思地自语道：“这帮家伙，真是好样的！"
"Not half so darned superior as they think they are.","自以为才高八斗，其实连一半都没有。"
"Quite a human touch—getting that Russian on the boko.","扔那一下倒是有人情味——打中那个俄国佬的鼻子了。"
"Phew!","呼！"
"It’s hot!’","真热啊！”"
"On that first day of the Eton and Harrow match all the forfeited heat of a chilly summer had gathered and shimmered over Michael, on the top of his Bank ‘bus; shimmered over straw hats, and pale, perspiring faces, over endless other ‘buses, business men, policemen, shopmen at their doors, sellers of newspapers, laces, jumping toys, endless carts and cabs, letterings and wires, all the confusion of the greatest conglomeration in the world—adjusted almost to a hair’s-breadth, by an unseen instinct.","在伊顿和哈罗比赛的第一天，在堤岸公交车的顶层上，迈克尔觉得整个凉爽夏天消失了的暑热都集中到一起了，闪烁在自己身上、行人的草帽上、因流汗而苍白的脸上、川流不息的其他公交车上；闪烁在那些生意人、警察、店员、卖报纸的、卖花边的、卖跳动玩具的人的身上；闪烁在运货马车和出租车上以及文字和电报上、世界上最大的混合体的所有混乱上——世上种种万物在一种看不见的本能的作用下，都调整到只差分毫了。"
"Michael stared and doubted.","迈克尔瞪着眼看着，也疑惑着。"
"Was it possible that, with everyone pursuing his own business, absorbed in his own job, the thing could work out?","如果人人都忙于自己的事业，全神贯注于自己的工作，事情有可能发展成那样吗？"
"An ant-heap was not busier, or more seemingly confused.","成群的蚂蚁也不会比这里更热闹，或是看上去比这里更混乱。"
"Live wires crossed and crossed and crossed—inextricable entanglement, you’d say; and yet, life, the order needful to life, somehow surviving!","你会说，忙碌的人们有如有生命的电线一般穿来穿去，穿去穿来——难分难解地纠结在一起，然而，生活以及生活所需的秩序却以某种方式幸存了下来！"
"‘No slouch of a miracle!’ he thought, ‘modern town life!’","“忙碌的人们显奇迹！”他想道，“现代都市生活！”"
"And suddenly it seemed to cease, as if demolished by the ruthless dispensation of some super Sibley Swan; for he was staring down a cul-de-sac.","可是，生活貌似突然停止了，仿佛是被西伯莱·斯旺之类的超人以无情的天命为由毁灭了，因为出现在他眼前的是一条死胡同。"
"On both sides, flat houses, recently re-buffed, extraordinarily alike; at the end, a flat buff house, even more alike, and down to it, grey virgin pavement, unstained by horse or petrol; no cars, cats, carts, policemen, hawkers, flies, or bees.","胡同两边都是些单调的房子，新刷的浅黄色，极其相似。路的尽头还是一幢单调的浅黄色的房子，跟其他的没什么两样。通向它的这条灰色的路，没有行人走过的痕迹，也没有马车或是汽油的痕迹，没有汽车、马车、警察、小贩、猫咪、苍蝇或是蜜蜂。"
"No sign of human life, except the names of legal firms to right and left of each open doorway.","没有人类生活的迹象，只是每一扇敞开的门的左右两边都挂着法律事务所的招牌。"
"“‘Cuthcott, Kingson and Forsyte, Commissioners for Oaths: First Floor.’”","“‘卡思考特、金森和福赛特，宣誓公证人：请上二楼。’”"
"‘Rule Britannia!’ thought Michael, ascending wide stone steps.","“大英律例！”迈克尔一边想着，一边踏上了宽阔的石头台阶。"
"Entering the room to which he had been ushered, he saw an old and pug-faced fellow with a round grizzled beard, a black alpaca coat, and a roomy holland waistcoat round his roomy middle, who rose from a swivel chair.","按照引导，他走进了那房间，看到一个老人从转椅里站了起来。那个老人有一张狮子狗似的脸，花白胡须，穿着黑色羊驼毛外套，在宽大的腰身外面还罩着一件宽大的荷兰亚麻马甲。"
"“Aoh!” he said, “Mr. Michael Mont, I think.","“啊！”他说道，“我想您是迈克尔·蒙特先生吧。"
"I’ve been expecting you.","我一直在等您呢。"
"We shan’t be long about it, after Mr. Forsyte comes.","等会儿索姆斯来了以后，用不了太长时间就能办好。"
"He’s just stepped round the corner.","他刚到那边拐角处去了。"
"Mrs. Michael well, I hope?”","迈克尔太太身体还好吧？”"
"“Thanks; as well as—”","“谢谢，还好——”"
"“Ye-es: it makes you anxious.","“是啊，您在担心她。"
"Take a seat.","请坐吧。"
"Perhaps you’d like to read the draft?”","也许您想看看那份草稿吧？”"
"Thus prescribed for, Michael took some foolscap from a pudgy hand, and sat down opposite.","说完，他便用那肥大的手递给坐在他对面的迈克尔几张大页纸。"
"With one eye on the old fellow, and the other on the foolscap, he read steadily.","他一只眼看着老头，另一只眼看着草稿，从容地读着。"
"“It seems to mean something,” he said at last.","“这看起来有点儿意思。”他最后说。"
"He saw a gape, as of a frog at a fly, settle in the beard; and hastened to repair his error.","他看见那胡须下面老人的嘴张大了，就像青蛙看见苍蝇时咧着大嘴一样，于是他赶紧弥补自己的口误。"
"“Calculating what’s going to happen if something else doesn’t, must be rather like being a bookmaker.”","“在没有其他事发生的前提下计算将要发生的事，就像是在登记赛马赌注一样。”"
"He felt at once that he had not succeeded.","他立刻感觉到自己这句话并没有弥补之前的失言。"
"There was a grumpy mutter:","因为他听到对方生气地说："
"“We don’t waste our time, ‘ere.","“我们这儿可不浪费时间。"
"Excuse me, I’m busy.”","原谅我失陪了，我还有事要忙。”"
"Michael sat, compunctious, watching him tick down a long page of entries.","迈克尔懊悔地坐在那里，看着他在长长的一页条目上做标记。"
"He was like one of those old dogs which lie outside front doors, keeping people off the premises, and notifying their fleas.","他就像一只老狗一样，趴在大门外，不让人靠近屋子，警告人们别惹麻烦。"
"After less than five minutes of that perfect silence Soames came in.","就这样过了近五分钟的绝对寂静之后，索姆斯走了进来。"
"“You’re here, then?” he said.","“哦，你来了?”他说。"
"“Yes, sir; I thought it best to come at the time you mentioned.","“是的，先生。我觉得最好按照您说的那个时间来。"
"What a nice cool room!”","多么凉爽舒服的房间啊！”"
"“Have you read this?” asked Soames, pointing to the draft.","“你看过这个了吗？”索姆斯指着那份草稿问道。"
"Michael nodded.","迈克尔点了点头。"
"“Did you understand it?”","“看明白了吗？”"
"“Up to a point, I think.”","“看懂些要点吧，我是这么想的。”"
"“The interest on THIS fifty thousand,” said Soames, “is Fleur’s until her eldest child, if it’s a boy, attains the age of twenty-one, when the capital becomes his absolutely.","“这五万块钱的利息，”索姆斯说，“是给弗勒的，直到她的最大的孩子年满21岁。如果是儿子，那么此后的本金就全归他了。"
"If it’s a girl, Fleur retains half the income for life, the rest of the income becomes payable to the girl when she attains the age of twenty-one or marries, and the capital of that half goes to her child or children lawfully begotten, at majority or marriage, in equal shares.","如果是女儿，那么弗勒终身都享有这份收益的一半，其余的收益等这个孩子年满21岁或是出嫁时，再给她，这一半本金归这个孩子合法生育的孩子或孩子们所有，等他们成年或是成亲时，大家均分。"
"The other half of the capital falls into Fleur’s estate, and is disposable by her will, or follows the laws of intestacy.”","另一半本金则归入弗勒的财产，可以根据她的遗嘱或是根据无遗嘱的法律来处理。”"
"“You make it wonderfully clear,” said Michael","“您订立得很清楚。”迈克尔说。"
"“Wait!” said Soames.","“等一下！”索姆斯说，"
"“If Fleur has no children—”","“如果弗勒没有孩子——”"
"Michael started.","迈克尔吃了一惊。"
"“Anything is possible,” said Soames gravely, “and my experience is that the contingencies not provided for are those which happen.","“什么事都有可能，”索姆斯严肃地说，“而我的经验告诉我，没有防范到的事恰恰是会意外发生的事。"
"In such a case the income of the whole is hers for life, and the capital hers at death to do as she likes with.","在这种情况下，所有收益归她终身所有，本金也归她，等她死的时候按她的意愿处理。"
"Failing that, it goes to the next of kin.","如果未能处理，这笔财产就交给她关系最近的亲属。"
"There are provisions against anticipation and so forth.”","对于预先支取等情况，也有相应条款规定。”"
"“Ought she to make a fresh will?” asked Michael, conscious of sweat on his forehead.","“她是不是应该立一份新的遗嘱呢？”迈克尔问道，觉得自己额头上都出汗了。"
"“Not unless she likes.","“不必，除非她自愿。"
"Her present will covers it.”","她现在的遗嘱会把这个包括进去的。”"
"“Have I to do anything?”","“需要我做什么事情吗？”"
"“No. I wanted you to understand the purport before I sign; that’s all.","“不需要。我要你在我签字之前了解其中的要义，仅此而已。"
"Give me the deed, Gradman, and get Wickson in, will you?”","把那份契约给我，格雷德曼，再叫威克森进来，好吗？”"
"Michael saw the old chap produce from a drawer a fine piece of parchment covered with copper-plate writing and seals, look at it lovingly, and place it before Soames.","迈克尔看到那个老人从抽屉里拿出一张印有铜版雕刻的字迹和印章的羊皮纸，亲切地看了看，然后放在了索姆斯面前。"
"When he had left the room, Soames said in a low voice:","老人离开房间后，索姆斯低声说："
"“This meeting on Tuesday—I can’t tell!","“周二的会议——我自己也没把握！"
"But, whatever happens, so far as I can see, this ought to stand.”","但是，不管发生什么事情，依我所见，这份契约都应该订立。”"
"“It’s awfully good of you, sir.”","“您真是太好了，先生。”"
"Soames nodded, testing a pen.","索姆斯点了点头，拿出一支钢笔试了试能不能写出字来。"
"“I’m afraid I’ve got wrong with your old clerk,” said Michael; “I like the look of him frightfully, but I accidentally compared him to a bookmaker.”","“我担心我刚才得罪了您那位老办事员，”迈克尔说，“我非常喜欢他那副神情，但是我刚才不小心把他比作赛马赌注登记经纪人了。”"
"Soames smiled.","索姆斯笑了。"
"“Gradman,” he said, “is a ‘character.’","“格雷德曼，”他说，“是个‘有个性的人’。"
"There aren’t many, nowadays.”","现在，这种人不多了。”"
"Michael was wondering: Could one be a ‘character’ under the age of sixty?—when the ‘character’ returned, with a pale man in dark clothes.","迈克尔纳闷了：一个快60岁的人，能被称为“有个性的人”吗？这时，那个“有个性的人”回来了，还带来了一个穿深色衣服、面色苍白的人。"
"Lifting his nose sideways, Soames said at once:","索姆斯把鼻子朝旁边儿撇了一下，马上说道："
"“This is a post-nuptial settlement on my daughter.","“这是一份给我女儿的婚后财产赠与书。"
"I deliver this as my act and deed.”","我把它交出，作为我行动及契约凭证。”"
"He wrote his name, and got up.","他签下了自己的名字，然后站了起来。"
"The pale person and Gradman wrote theirs, and the former left the room.","那个面色苍白的人和格雷德曼也签了名，然后那个人就离开了。"
"There was a silence as of repletion.","这时大家都很满意，没有说话。"
"“Do you want me any more?” asked Michael.","“您还需要我做什么吗？”迈克尔问道。"
"“Yes.","“是的。"
"I want you to see me deposit it at the bank with the marriage settlement.","我想让你看着我把它存入银行，和结婚时的财产赠与书放在一起。"
"Shan’t come back, Gradman!”","我就不回来了，格雷德曼！”"
"“Good-bye, Mr. Gradman.”","“再见，格雷德曼先生。”"
"Michael heard the old fellow mutter through his beard half buried in a drawer to which he was returning the draft, and followed Soames out.","迈克尔听到那个老人的声音从胡子中间传出来。那胡子还有一半埋在抽屉里，因为老人正在把那份草稿放进抽屉里。然后，迈克尔就跟着索姆斯出来了。"
"“Here’s where I used to be,” said Soames as they went along the Poultry; “and my father before me.”","“这是我以前常呆的地方，”他们沿着家禽街走着的时候，索姆斯说，“在我之前是我父亲常呆的地方。”"
"“More genial, perhaps,” said Michael.","“也许更亲切些吧。”迈克尔说。"
"“The trustees are meeting us at the bank; you remember them?”","“那些受托管理人要在银行和我们碰头。你还记得他们吗？”"
"“Cousins of Fleur’s, weren’t they, sir?”","“弗勒的表亲们，是吗，先生？”"
"“Second cousins; young Roger’s eldest, and young Nicholas’.","“远房表亲。小罗杰的大儿子，还有小尼古拉斯的大儿子。"
"I chose them youngish.","我选他们是因为他们年轻。"

"Very young Nicholas is at the Bar.”","小小尼古拉斯现在是律师。”"
"Michael’s ears stood up.","迈克尔的耳朵立起来了。"
"“What about the next lot, sir?","“那下一代怎么称呼呢，先生？"
"Very very young Roger would be almost insulting, wouldn’t it?”","叫小小小罗杰很是无礼啊，不是吗？”"
"“There won’t be one,” said Soames, “with taxation where it is.","“不会有这样的人的，”索姆斯说，“现在税收这么重。"
"He can’t afford it; he’s a steady chap.","他负担不起的，他是个求稳的人。"
"What are you going to call your boy, if it IS one?”","你准备给孩子起什么名字，如果是个男孩的话？”"

"“H’m!","“哼！"
"And if it’s a girl?”","要是女孩呢？”"
"“Oh!—if it’s a girl—Anne.”","“啊！要是女孩的话——就叫安妮。”"
"“Yes,” said Soames: “Very neat.","“好，”索姆斯说，“很好。"
"Here they are!”","他们已经来了！”"
"They had reached the bank, and in the entrance Michael saw two Forsytes between thirty and forty, whose chinny faces he dimly remembered.","他们到银行了。在入口处，迈克尔看到了那两个福赛特家的人，三四十岁年纪，他还模糊地记得他们那下巴突出的样子。"
"Escorted by a man with bright buttons down his front, they all went to a room, where a man without buttons produced a japanned box.","在一个胸前有闪亮纽扣的人的陪同下，他们进到一个房间里，那里一个胸前没有纽扣的人拿出一个漆盒子。"
"One of the Forsytes opened it with a key; Soames muttered an incantation, and deposited the deed.","一位福赛特家族的人拿钥匙把它打开了，索姆斯小声地念叨了点儿什么，然后把契约放了进去。"
"When he and the chinnier Forsyte had exchanged a few remarks with the manager on the question of the bank rate, they all went back to the lobby and parted with the words: “Well, good-bye.”","他和福赛特家那个下巴突出的人就银行利率问题跟经理聊了几句，然后大家一起回到了大厅，互相说了句“那么，再见了”，就分手了。"
"“Now,” said Soames, in the din and hustle of the street, “he’s provided for, so far as I can see.","“现在，”索姆斯在喧闹忙碌的街道上说，“据我所知，你们已经为他准备好了。"
"When exactly do you expect it?”","你们预计他到底什么时候出生呢？”"

"“That!” said Soames.","“那种东西！”索姆斯说。"
"He did not mention that he himself was doing it, thus giving away the state of his nerves.","他并没有提及自己也在做心理疗法，以免暴露自己的精神状态，"

"I expect he’d like to tell you all about it.”","我想他会很高兴地告诉你这件事的。”"
"Fleur moved restlessly.","弗勒不安地动了一下。"
"“Presently.","“马上就来。"

"Chapter XI","第十一章"
"With a Small ‘n’","大自然露出了本来面目"
"On the night of the Monday following, after Fleur had gone to bed, Michael and Soames sat listening to the mutter of London coming through the windows of the Chinese room opened to the brooding heat.","到了周一的晚上，等弗勒上床睡觉以后，迈克尔和索姆斯两人坐着倾听伦敦的喧嚣。因为天气闷热，那间中式的房间敞开了窗户，声音就是从那里传进来的。"
"“They say the war killed sentiment,” said Soames suddenly: “Is that true?”","“据说战争泯灭了人类的情感，”索姆斯突然说道，“这是真的吗？”"
"“In a way, yes, sir.","“在某种程度上说，是真的，先生。"
"We had so much reality that we don’t want any more.”","我们经历了那么多的现实，不想要更多的感情了。”"
"“I don’t follow you.”","“我不明白你的意思。”"
"“I meant that only reality really makes you feel.","“我是说人们只对现实才有感觉。"
"So if you pretend there IS no reality, you don’t have to feel.","因此，要是你假装世上没有现实，那么你也就不必对什么有感觉了。"
"It answers awfully well, up to a point.”","从某种程度上来讲，这是很好的解答。”"
"“Ah!” said Soames.","“啊！”索姆斯说，"
"“Her mother comes up tomorrow morning, to stay.","“她母亲明天早晨过来，住在这儿。"
"This P. P. R. S. meeting of mine is at half-past two.","下午两点半我去参加天佑再保险公司的股东大会。"
"Good-night!”","晚安！”"
"Michael, at the window, watched the heat gathered black over the Square.","迈克尔站在窗前，看着热气在广场上空凝聚成了乌云。"
"A few tepid drops fell on his outstretched hand.","他把手伸出窗外，接到了几滴温热的雨点。"
"A cat stole by under a lamp-post, and vanished into shadow so thick that it seemed uncivilised.","一只猫从街灯下面偷偷溜过去，消失在一片阴影中，那阴影如此厚重，以至于那里似乎像是蛮荒之地。"
"Queer question of ‘Old Forsyte’s’ about sentiment; odd that he should ask it!","“老福赛特”提出的那个关于伤感之情的问题很怪异，而且他居然会问起这样的问题来！"
"‘Up to a point!","“奇怪到了一定程度！"
"But don’t we all get past that point?’ he thought.","但是我们不都怪得超过这个程度了吗？”他想道。"
"Look at Wilfrid, and himself—after the war they had deemed it blasphemous to admit that anything mattered except eating and drinking, for tomorrow they died; even fellows like Nazing, and Master, who were never in the war, had felt like that ever since.","看看威尔弗里德，还有他自己——经历了战争之后，他们认为如果除了吃喝之外还有其他重要的事情，那就是在亵渎神明，因为明天可能就没命了。即便是内津、马斯特这样没上过战场的人，战后也有这样的感觉。"
"Well, Wilfrid had got it in the neck; and he himself had got it in the wind; and he would bet that—barring one here and there whose blood was made of ink—they would all get it in the neck or wind soon or late.","哎，威尔弗里德已经亲身体验到了痛苦，而他自己也虚惊一场，而且他愿意打赌——除了零零散散个别冷血的家伙之外——他们早晚也会和他俩一样体验痛苦或是虚惊。"
"Why, he would cheerfully bear Fleur’s pain and risk, instead of her!","哎呀，他倒是愿意由自己来替弗勒承受痛苦和风险，不要再让她承受了！"
"But if nothing mattered, why should he feel like that?","但是如果什么事情都不重要的话，他为何会有这样的感觉呢？"
"Turning from the window, he leaned against the lacquered back of the jade-green settee, and stared at the wall space between the Chinese tea-chests.","从窗边转过身来，他靠在翠绿色长椅那用油漆漆过的后背上，注视着两个中式茶柜之间的那块空白墙壁。"
"Jolly thoughtful of the ‘old man’ to have that white monkey down!","“老头子”把白猿取下来真是考虑得太周到了！"
"The brute was potent—symbolic of the world’s mood: beliefs cancelled, faiths withdrawn!","画中的畜生很有影响力——象征着这个世界的精神状态：没有信仰，没有信念！"
"And, dash it! not only the young—but the old—were in that temper!","该死！不仅年轻人——就连老人——都是这种心境！"
"‘Old Forsyte,’ or he would never have been scared by that monkey’s eyes; yes, and his own governor, and Elderson, and all the rest.","“老福赛特”就是这样，要不然他也不会害怕那只白猿的眼神，对了，还有自己的父亲，还有埃尔德森，还有其他的人都是这样。"
"Young and old—no real belief in anything!","不论老幼——对什么都没有真正的信仰！"
"And yet—revolt sprang up in Michael, with a whirr, like a covey of partridges.","然后——迈克尔的心里忽然涌起一股反感，像一群鹧鸪振翅飞过似的。"
"It DID matter that some person or some principle outside oneself should be more precious than oneself—it dashed well did!","除了自己之外，还有别的人或是某个原则比自己还要重要，这的确是件要紧的事——确确实实是的！"
"Sentiment, then, wasn’t dead—nor faith, nor belief, which were the same things.","那么，情感，并没有泯灭——信仰、信念也没有泯灭，这都是一回事。"
"They were only shedding shell, working through chrysalis, into—butterflies, perhaps.","它们也许只是在蜕壳，逐渐变成蛹，最后变成——蝴蝶。"
"Faith, sentiment, belief, had gone underground, possibly, but they were there, even in ‘Old Forsyte’ and himself.","信念、情感、信仰可能已经转入地下了，但是它们还在，甚至在“老福赛特”和自己身上。"
"He had a good mind to put the monkey up again.","他很想把那幅白猿再挂起来。"
"No use exaggerating his importance!...","无需夸大它的影响力……"
"By George!","糟糕！"
"Some flare!","闪电了！"
"A jagged streak of vivid light had stripped darkness off the night.","一道锯齿形的亮光划破了黑暗的夜空。"
"Michael crossed, to close the windows.","迈克尔走过去，把窗户关上。"
"A shattering peal of thunder blundered overhead; and down came the rain, slashing and sluicing.","头顶突然炸开了一阵响雷，接着就下雨了，倾盆大雨。"
"He saw a man running, black, like a shadow across a dark blue screen; saw him by the light of another flash, suddenly made lurid and full of small meaning, with face of cheerful anxiety, as if he were saying: “Hang it, I’m getting wet!”","他看到有人在跑，黑漆漆的，像一个影子从深蓝色的银幕前跑过。在另一道闪电的映照下，他看到那个人突然变得苍白而有内涵，脸上混杂着欢喜和焦急，仿佛在说：“该死的，把我淋湿了！”"
"Another frantic crash!","接着又是一阵狂乱的雷鸣！"
"‘Fleur!’ thought Michael; and clanging the last window down, he ran upstairs.","“弗勒！”迈克尔想着，他咣当一声关上了最后一扇窗户，然后跑上楼去。"
"She was sitting up in bed, with a face all round, and young, and startled.","她坐在床上，年轻的小脸圆圆的，受了惊吓。"
"‘Brutes!’ he thought—guns and the heavens confounded in his mind: ‘They’ve waked her up!’","“畜生！”他心里想——战场的枪炮声和天空的雷电在他脑子里混在一起，“它们把她吵醒了！”"
"“It’s all right, darling!","“别害怕，亲爱的！"
"Just another little summer kick-up!","只是打雷了！"
"Were you asleep?”","你刚才睡着了？”"
"“I was dreaming!”","“我正做梦呢！”"
"He felt her hand clutching within his own, saw a sudden pinched look on her face, with a sort of rage.","他感到她的手在他的手中攥得紧紧的，脸色因突然的紧张而变得苍白，好像还带着愤怒。"
"What infernal luck!","真背运！"
"“Where’s Ting?”","“小丁在哪儿呢？”"
"No dog was in the corner.","角落里没有狗。"
"“Under the bed—you bet!","“一定躲在床底下了！"
"Would you like him up?”","想让它到床上去吗？”"
"“No. Let him stay; he hates it.”","“不必了。让它呆在那儿吧，它怕打雷。”"
"She put her head against his arm, and Michael curled his hand round her other ear.","她把头靠在他胳膊上，迈克尔用手堵着她的另一只耳朵。"
"“I never liked thunder much!” said Fleur,” and now it—it hurts!”","“我从来都不怎么喜欢雷声！”弗勒说，“现在它——让我难过！”"
"High above her hair Michael’s face underwent the contortions of an overwhelming tenderness.","在弗勒的头发上方，迈克尔的脸温柔得都变形了。"
"One of those crashes which seem just overhead sent her face burrowing against his chest, and, sitting on the bed, he gathered her in, close.","雷声不断，有一个仿佛就在他们头顶炸响，吓得弗勒把脸埋进他的怀里去了。他乘势坐在床上，紧紧地搂住了她。"
"“I wish it were over,” came, smothered, from her lips.","“真希望快点儿结束。”她的声音闷闷地从双唇间传了出来。"
"“It will be directly, darling; it came on so suddenly!”","“马上就好了，亲爱的，它来得太突然了！”"
"But he knew she didn’t mean the storm.","但是他明白她说的并不是这场雷雨。"
"“If I come through, I’m going to be quite different to you, Michael.”","“要是我能熬过这一关，我会待你完全不同的，迈克尔。”"
"Anxiety was the natural accompaniment of such events, but the words, “If I come through” turned Michael’s heart right over.","遇上这种事，难免会焦虑，但是那句话，“要是我能熬过去”却将迈克尔的心揪了起来。"
"Incredible that one so young and pretty should be in even the remotest danger of extinction; incredibly painful that she should be in fear of it!","一个这么年轻、美丽的人哪怕是处于一丝濒临死亡的危险，这都让人难以置信，她为此而担心，这更是难以置信的痛苦了！"
"He hadn’t realised.","他以前从来没有意识到这一点。"
"She had been so calm, so matter-of-fact about it all.","在这件事情上，她一直是那么镇静，那么平淡。"
"“Don’t!” he mumbled; “of course you’ll come through.”","“别这么说！”他喃喃地说，“你当然可以熬过去。”"
"“I’m afraid.”","“我害怕。”"
"The sound was small and smothered, but the words hurt horribly.","她说话的声音小小的、闷闷的，但是这句话让人很难过。"
"Nature, with the small ‘n,’ forcing fear into this girl he loved so awfully!","大自然露出了本性，迫使她——这个他深爱的姑娘——害怕了！"
"Nature kicking up this godless din above her poor little head!","大自然在她的小脑瓜上面肆无忌惮地制造噪音。"
"“Ducky, you’ll have twilight sleep and know nothing about it; and be as right as rain in no time.”","“亲爱的，你会接受半麻醉分娩，不会有什么感觉的。然后就像下雨一样，一会儿就过去了。”"
"Fleur freed her hand.","弗勒把自己的手抽了出来。"
"“Not if it’s not good for him.","“要是对孩子不好的话，就别用了。"
"Is it?”","会对孩子有影响吗？”"

"Michael opened the door a crack.","迈克尔把门开了一条缝。"
"Soames was there—unnatural—in a blue dressing gown and scarlet slippers!","索姆斯站在那里——很奇怪——他穿着蓝色的睡衣和红色的拖鞋！"
"“Is she all right?” he whispered.","“她还好吗？”他小声问道。"
"“Yes, yes.”","“是的。还好。”"
"“In this bobbery she oughtn’t to be left.”","“这会儿这么闹，可不能让她自己呆着。”"

"I shall sleep on the sofa.”","我会睡在沙发上的。”"

"“I will.”","“我会的。”"
"Soames’ eyes slid past, peering into the room.","索姆斯的目光从他身上越过，向屋里张望了一下。"
"A string worked in his throat, as if he had things to say which did not emerge.","他喉头一紧，仿佛要说什么，却又没说出口。"
"He shook his head, and turned.","他只是摇了摇头，转身走了。"
"His slim figure, longer than usual, in its gown, receded down the corridor, past the Japanese prints which he had given them.","因为穿着睡衣，他那瘦削的身影显得比平时还要长，走过他送给他们的那几张日本版画，向走廊那边走去。"
"Closing the door again, Michael stood looking at the bed.","迈克尔再次把门关好，站在那里望着床。"
"Fleur had settled down; her eyes were closed, her lips moving.","弗勒已经躺下去了，眼睛闭着，嘴唇在动。"
"He stole back on tiptoe.","他踮着脚尖悄悄地走了回去。"

"Michael saw her eyelids quiver, her lips stop, then move again.","迈克尔看到她眼睑在颤动，嘴唇却停了下来，一会又动了起来。"
"‘Coue!’ he thought.","“库埃的心理暗示！”他心里想。"
"He lay down on the sofa at the foot of the bed, whence, without sound, he could raise himself and see her.","他躺在床角的沙发上，他可以从那里悄悄地抬起身子看着她。"

"A faint last mutter roused him to look at her once more, high on her pillows by the carefully shaded light.","最后一阵低语让他又看了她一眼。她枕着高高的枕头，灯光被细心地遮住了。"
"Young—young!","年轻——真年轻！"
"Colourless, like a flower in wax!","苍白无色，像是朵蜡制的花！"
"No scheme in her brain, no dread—peaceful!","脑子里没有什么计划，也没有畏惧——安安静静的！"
"If only she could stay like that and wake up with it all over!","要是她能保持这样，然后一觉醒来，事情都过去了，那就好了！"
"He looked away.","他看了看旁边。"
"And there she was at the far end, dim, reflected in a glass; and there to the right, again.","从镜子里看，她在远远的那一边，模模糊糊的；再看看右边，也是一样。"
"She lay, as it were, all round him in the pretty room, the inhabiting spirit—of his heart.","在这间漂亮的房间里，她仿佛躺在他的周围，守护着他的心灵。"
"It was quite still now.","这会儿安静极了。"
"Through a chink in those powder-blue curtains he could see some stars.","透过那些浅灰蓝色窗帘的缝隙，他可以看到几颗星星。"
"Big Ben chimed one.","大本钟敲1点钟了。"
"He had slept, perhaps, dozed at least, dreamed a little.","他大概睡着了，起码是打了个盹儿，还做了一会儿梦。"
"A small sound woke him.","一个微弱的声音吵醒了他。"
"A very little dog, tail down, yellow, low and unimportant, was passing down the room, trailing across it to the far corner.","一只很小的狗，黄色的，尾巴垂着，卑微而又不引人注意，正慢慢地横穿这个房间，朝远远的角落走去。"
"‘Ah!’ thought Michael, closing his eyes again: ‘You!’","“啊！”迈克尔想着，又闭上了眼睛，“是它啊！”"

"Chapter XII","第十二章"
"Ordeal by Shareholder","股东的严峻考验"
"Repairing, next day, to the Aeroplane Club, where, notably spruce, Sir Lawrence was waiting in the lounge, Michael thought: ‘Good old Bart! he’s got himself up for the guillotine all right!’","第二天，迈克尔到飞机俱乐部去。在那里，经过一番修饰显得格外潇洒的劳伦斯爵士正在休息室里等待，迈克尔想：“好一个老准爵爷！他已经打扮好准备上断头台了！”"
"“That white piping will show the blood!” he said.","“那条白色的拷边会把血显现出来的！”他说，"
"“Old Forsyte’s neat this morning, but not so gaudy.”","“老福赛特今天早上很整洁，但是不俗气。”"
"“Ah!","“啊！"
"How is ‘Old Forsyte’?","‘老福赛特’怎么样？"
"In good heart?”","情绪好吗？”"
"“One doesn’t ask him, sir.","“这可不方便问他，先生。"
"How do you feel yourself?”","您自己觉得怎么样？”"
"“Exactly as I used to before the Eton and Winchester match.","“和过去我在伊顿和温彻斯特比赛前的心情一模一样。"
"I think I shall have shandy-gaff at lunch.”","我想我要在吃午饭的时候喝点儿香迪啤酒。”"
"When they had taken their seats, Sir Lawrence went on:","他们坐下之后，劳伦斯爵士接着说："
"“I remember seeing a man tried for murder in Colombo; the poor fellow was positively blue.","“我记得在科伦坡看到一个人因为谋杀而受审，那个可怜的家伙可真够垂头丧气的。"
"I think my favourite moment in the past, Michael, is Walter Raleigh asking for a second shirt.","我认为过去我最得意的时候，迈克尔，是沃尔特·罗利再次向我索要衬衫的时候。"
"By the way, it’s never been properly settled yet whether the courtiers of that day were lousy.","顺便说一句，那时候的朝臣们身上是否长虱子，这个问题至今还没有定论。"
"What are you going to have, my dear fellow?”","你想吃点儿什么，亲爱的年轻人？”"
"“Cold beef, pickled walnuts, and gooseberry tart.”","“冷牛肉、盐渍核桃和醋栗馅饼。”"
"“Excellent for the character.","“这些东西非常适合你。"
"I shall have curry; they give you a very good Bombay duck here.","我要吃咖喱，这里的龙头鱼非常不错。"
"I rather fancy we shall be fired, Michael.","我很确信我们会被解雇的，迈克尔。"
"‘Nous sommes trahis!’ used to be the prerogative of the French, but I’m afraid we’re getting the attitude, too.","‘我们已经被人出卖了！’这向来是法国人特有的说法，但是恐怕我们也逐渐抱有这种态度了。"
"The Yellow Press has made a difference.”","黄色报刊是起了作用的。”"
"Michael shook his head.","迈克尔摇了摇头。"
"“We say it, but we don’t act on it; the climate’s too uncertain.”","“我们是这样说的，但是并没有这样做。风气太不稳定了。”"
"“That sounds deep.","“这话听起来很深刻。"
"This looks very good curry—will you change your mind?","这个咖喱看起来很不错——你要不要也换成咖喱？"

"It’ll be serious for him if we’re shown the door.”","如果我们被赶了出去，事情对他来说就严重了。”"
"“Deuced rum,” said Michael suddenly, “how titles still go down.","“真奇怪，”迈克尔突然说，“贵族头衔怎么还很受欢迎。"

"“Shareholders,” said Sir Lawrence; “the word is comprehensive.","“股东，”劳伦斯爵士说，“这个词涉及面很广泛。"
"Who are they, what are they, when are they?”","他们是谁，他们是干什么的，他们什么时候成为股东的？”"

"“Certainly not.”","“当然不让进了。”"
"Michael frowned.","迈克尔皱了皱眉头。"
"“What paper,” he said, “is sure not to be represented?”","“哪家报纸，”他说，“一定不会派代表来呢？”"
"Sir Lawrence gave his whinnying laugh.","劳伦斯爵士发出马嘶般的笑声。"
"“The Field,” he said; “The Horse and Hound; The Gardener’s Weekly.”","“《田野报》，”他说，“《马与猎犬报》、《园丁周报》。”"
"“I’ll slide in on them.”","“我就以他们的名义溜进去。”"
"“You’ll see us die game, I hope,” said Sir Lawrence, with sudden gravity.","“我希望你会看到我们宁死不屈。”劳伦斯爵士突然严肃地说。"
"They took a cab together to the meeting, but separated before reaching the door of the hotel.","他们一起乘出租车去开会，但是在到达宾馆门口之前就分开了。"
"Michael had thought better of the Press, and took up a position in the passage, whence he could watch for a chance.","迈克尔重新考虑之后，决定不以报社的名义混进去，他在走廊里找了个位置，在此等待机会。"
"Stout men, in dark suits, with a palpable look of having lunched off turbot, joints, and cheese, kept passing him.","穿着黑色西服的矮胖的人们不断从他身边经过，脸上明显带着一种午餐吃了大比目鱼、大块肉和奶酪的神情。"
"He noticed that each handed the janitor a paper.","他注意到每个人都递给看门人一张纸。"
"‘I’ll hand him a paper, too,’ he thought, ‘and scoot in.’","“我也递给他一张纸，”他想，“然后冲进去。”"
"Watching for some even stouter men, he took cover between two of them, and approached the door, with an announcement of ‘Counterfeits’ in his left hand.","他看到几个更加矮胖的人，便躲藏在其中两个人中间，走进门口，左手拿着一张“假冒的”通知。"
"Handing it across a neighbouring importance, he was quickly into a seat.","他越过身边的一个大人物把它递过去，就迅速坐在一个位子上。"
"He saw the janitor’s face poked round the door.","他看到看门人在门口探了一下头。"
"‘No, my friend,’ thought Michael, ‘if you could tell duds from shareholders, you wouldn’t be in that job!’","“不，我的朋友，”迈克尔想，“如果你能从股东中分辨出谁是冒牌货，你就不会做这份工作了！”"
"He found a report before him, and holding it up, looked at other things.","他发现面前有一份报告，就拿了起来，眼睛却看着别的东西。"
"The room seemed to him to have been got by a concert-hall out of a station waiting-room.","这个房间在他看来似乎是由一个车站候车室改建成的音乐厅。"
"It had a platform with a long table, behind which were seven empty chairs, and seven inkpots, with seven quill pens upright in them.","房间里面有一个平台，上面摆着一张长桌子，桌子后面有七把空椅子，桌子上面放着七只墨水瓶，里面插着七只鹅毛笔。"
"‘Quills!’ thought Michael; ‘symbolic, I suppose—they’ll all use fountain-pens!’","“鹅毛笔！”迈克尔想，“我想，这只是象征性的——他们都使用钢笔！”"
"Back-centre of the platform was a door, and in front, below it, a table, where four men were sitting, fiddling with notebooks.","平台后面的中央有一扇门，在门前的下方，有一张桌子，四个人坐在那里，拨弄着笔记本。"
"‘Orchestra,’ thought Michael.","“管弦乐队。”迈克尔想。"
"He turned his attention to the eight or ten rows of shareholders.","他把注意力转向八到十排的股东。"
"They looked what they were, but he could not tell why.","他们看上去还是老样子，他也说不上来为什么。"
"Their faces were cast in an infinity of moulds, but all had the air of waiting for something they knew they would not get.","他们的脸虽然长得各式各样，但是都带有一种神态，仿佛在等待他们明知自己不会得到的东西。"
"What sort of lives did they lead, or did their lives lead them?","他们过着什么样的生活，或者说他们的生活怎样造就了他们？"
"Nearly all wore moustaches.","几乎所有的人都留着小胡子。"
"His neighbours to right and left were the same stout shareholders between whom he had slipped in; they both had thick lobes to their ears, and necks even broader than the straight broad backs of their heads.","他左右两边的邻座就是他夹在他们中间溜进来的那两个矮胖的股东。他俩的耳朵都有大耳垂，脖子甚至比后脑勺还要粗。"
"He was a good deal impressed.","这给他留下了深刻的印象。"
"Dotted here and there he noticed a woman, or a parson.","他注意到在座之中还零星坐着一两位女士和牧师。"
"There was practically no conversation, from which he surmised that no one knew his neighbour.","几乎没有什么人在交谈，由此他推测出没有人认识自己的邻座。"
"He had a feeling that a dog somewhere would have humanised the occasion.","他觉得如果在某个地方有一条狗的话，会使这个场合显得人性化。"
"He was musing on the colour scheme of green picked out with chocolate and chased with gold, when the door behind the platform was thrown open, and seven men in black coats filed in, and with little bows took their seats behind the quills.","他正在沉思着室内那种在绿色的底色上点缀着巧克力色并镶嵌着金色的色彩搭配，这时平台后面的那扇门突然打开了，七个穿着黑色外套的人陆续走了进来，微微鞠躬之后，就坐在了鹅毛笔后面的位子上。"
"They reminded him of people getting up on horses, or about to play the piano—full of small adjustments.","他们使他想到了正在翻身上马的人，或者将要弹钢琴的人——都有许多小的调整动作。"
"That—on the Chairman’s right—would be old Fontenoy, with a face entirely composed of features.","那个——坐在董事长右边的——应该是老福坦诺，他的脸完全是由各种特征组成的。"
"Michael had an odd conceit: a little thing in a white top-hat sat inside the brain, driving the features eight-inhand.","迈克尔有一种奇怪的幻想：一个头戴白色大礼帽的小家伙坐在大脑里面，八马齐驱地驾驭着这些特征。"
"Then came a face straight from a picture of Her Majesty’s Government in 1850, round and pink, with a high nose, a small mouth, and little white whiskers; while at the end on the right was a countenance whose jaw and eyes seemed boring into a conundrum beyond the wall at Michael’s back.","之后的那张面孔好像直接是从1850年的女王陛下政府的一张画里出来的，粉红色的圆脸、高鼻梁、小嘴巴，还有一小撮白色的络腮胡子。而在右边的尽头有一张面孔，它的下巴和眼睛仿佛钻进了迈克尔背后那面墙之外的一个谜题里面去了。"
"‘Legal!’ he thought.","“法律！”他想。"
"His scrutiny passed back to the Chairman.","他的目光又绕了回来仔细观察董事长。"
"Chosen?","选举出来的？"
"Was he—or was he not?","他是——或者不是？"
"A bearded man, a little behind on the Chairman’s left, was already reading from a book, in a rapid monotonous voice.","一个留着胡子的人，在董事长的左边稍靠后一点儿的地方，已经在用一种又快又单调的嗓音照本宣科。"
"That must be the secretary letting off his minute guns.","那一定是秘书在放他的志哀礼炮。"
"And in front of him was clearly the new manager, on whose left Michael observed his own father.","在他前面的显然是新任的经理，在经理的左边，迈克尔看到了自己的父亲。"
"The dark pothooks over Sir Lawrence’s right eye were slightly raised, and his mouth was puckered under the cut line of his small moustache.","劳伦斯爵士右眼上的黑色单镜片框钩微微上扬，他的嘴巴缩拢在修剪整齐的小胡子下面。"
"He looked almost Oriental, quick but still.","他看上去简直就像个东方人，机敏而又沉稳。"
"His left hand held his tortoiseshell-rimmed monocle between thumb and finger.","他用左手的拇指和食指捏着他那玳瑁色边框的单片眼镜。"
"‘Not quite in the scene!’ thought Michael; ‘poor old Bart!’","“还不太适应这种场面呢！”迈克尔想，“可怜的老准爵爷！”"
"He had come now to the last of the row.","现在他的目光来到了这一排最后一个人的身上。"
"‘Old Forsyte’ was sitting precisely as if alone in the world; with one corner of his mouth just drawn down, and one nostril just drawn up, he seemed to Michael quite fascinatingly detached; and yet not out of the picture.","“老福赛特”坐在那里，完全就像全世界只有他孤身一人似的。他的一个嘴角垂下来，一个鼻孔拉上去，在迈克尔看来，他那副超然的样子十分迷人，然而他又不是置身事外的。"
"Within that still neat figure, whereof only one patent-leather boot seemed with a slight movement to be living, was intense concentration, entire respect for the proceedings, and yet, a queer contempt for them; he was like a statue of reality, by one who had seen that there was precious little reality in it.","在他那依然匀称的身材里，只有一只漆皮的靴子似乎轻微地动着，表明他是活的。他全神贯注，完全尊重会议程序，然而，对其又有一种奇怪的轻视。他就像是一座现实的雕塑，而塑造它的人发现其中几乎没有什么宝贵的现实。"
"‘He chills my soup,’ thought Michael, ‘but—dash it!—I can’t help half admiring him!’","“他让我倒胃口，”迈克尔想，“但是——该死——我忍不住有点儿佩服他！”"
"The Chairman had now risen.","现在董事长站了起来。"
"‘He IS’—thought Michael; ‘no, he isn’t—yes—no—I can’t tell!’","“他是”——迈克尔想，“不，他不是——是——不——我分辨不出来！”"
"He could hardly attend to what the Chairman said, for wondering whether he was chosen or not, though well aware that it did not matter at all.","他几乎无法专心听董事长说的话，因为他正在想他究竟是不是选举出来的，尽管他非常清楚这个问题无关紧要。"
"The Chairman kept steadily on.","董事长不慌不忙地继续说下去。"
"Distracted, Michael caught words and words: “European situation—misguided policy—French—totally unexpected—position disclosed—manager—unfortunate circumstances shortly to be explained to you—future of this great concern—no reason to doubt—”","由于思想不集中，迈克尔只听到了只言片语：“欧洲局势——被误导的方针政策——法国人——完全出乎意料——揭露出来的情况——经理——马上就会向你们解释这些不幸的情况——大家关注的公司未来——没有理由担心——”"
"‘Oil,’ thought Michael, ‘he is—and yet—!’","“废话，”迈克尔想，“他是——可是——！”"
"“I will now ask one of your directors, Mr. Forsyte, to give you at first hand an account of this painful matter.”","“现在我要请公司的董事之一，福赛特先生，向你们直接讲述这件令人痛心的事情。”"
"Michael saw Soames, pale and deliberate, take a piece of paper from his breast-pocket, and rise.","迈克尔看到索姆斯，脸色苍白而从容不迫，从胸前的口袋中掏出一张纸，然后站了起来。"
"Was it to the occasion?","他这是挺身而出吗？"
"“I will give you the facts shortly,” he said in a voice which reminded Michael of a dry, made-up wine.","“我把事实简单向大家汇报一下，”他说话的声音让迈克尔想起了一种调制的干葡萄酒，"
"“On the eleventh of January last I was visited by a clerk in the employ of the Society—”","“一月十一日那天，本公司雇佣的一名职员来见我——”"
"Familiar with these details, Michael paid them little attention, watching the shareholders for signs of reaction.","由于非常熟悉这些细节，迈克尔没有怎么仔细听，而是注视着股东们的反应。"
"He saw none, and it was suddenly borne in on him why they wore moustaches: They could not trust their mouths!","他看不出任何迹象，突然他想到他们为什么要留胡子：他们不能相信自己的嘴巴！"
"Character was in the mouth.","性格就在嘴巴里。"
"Moustaches had come in when people no longer went about, like the old Duke, saying: “Think what you damned well like of my character!”","胡子是在人们不再四处走动的时候流行起来的，就像那个老公爵，说：“这就是我的性格，你们爱怎么想就怎么想吧！”"
"Mouths had tried to come in again, of course, before the war; but what with majors, shareholders, and the working classes, they now had little or no chance!","当然，在战前，不留胡子的光嘴巴曾经试图再次流行起来，但是由于年长的人、股东以及工人阶级的原因，它们流行起来的机会很小或根本就没有机会！"
"He heard Soames say: “In these circumstances we came to the conclusion that there was nothing for it but to wait and see.”","他听到索姆斯说：“在这种情况下，我们得出的结论是，除了静待观望形势之外，，没有别的办法。”"
"Michael saw a sudden quiver pass over the moustaches, as might wind over grass.","迈克尔看到那些胡子突然颤动了一下，就像一阵风吹过草地。"
"‘Wrong phrase,’ he thought; ‘we all do it, but we can’t bear being reminded of it.’","“措辞不当，”他想，“我们都犯过这种错误，但是我们都不能容忍别人提起它。”"
"“Six weeks ago, however,” he heard Soames intone, “an accidental incident seems to have warned your late manager that Sir Lawrence and I still entertained suspicions, for I received a letter from him practically admitting that he had taken this secret commission on the German business, and asking me to inform the Board that he had gone abroad and left no property behind him.","“但是，六个星期之前，”他听到索姆斯拖长了声音，“一件意外的事情似乎警告了你们的前任经理，使他知道劳伦斯爵士和我对他仍然抱有怀疑，因为我收到了他的一封来信，信中实际上承认了他在德国业务中收受了秘密佣金，并要求我通知董事会，他已经出国了，并且没有留下任何财产。"
"This statement we have been at pains to verify.","我们已经尽力对这番陈述进行了核实。"
"In these circumstances we had no alternative but to call you together, and lay the facts before you.”","在这种情况下，我们别无选择，只能把大家召集起来，并把事实摆在你们面前。”"
"The voice, which had not varied an iota, ceased its recital; and Michael saw his father-inlaw return to his detachment—stork on one leg, about to apply beak to parasite, could have inspired no greater sense of loneliness.","一直没有丝毫变化的声音停止了陈述；迈克尔看到他的岳父又恢复了超然的状态——就像一只鹳鸟单腿站立着，正准备用嘴去啄食寄生虫，不会引起更加强烈的孤寂感了。"
"‘Too like the first account of the battle of Jutland!’ he thought: ‘He mentioned all the losses, and never once struck the human note.’","“太像日德兰海战的第一次战况报告了！”他想，“他提到了所有的损失，但是一次也没有打动人们的心。”"
"A pause ensued, such as occurs before an awkward fence, till somebody has found a gate.","接下来是一阵停顿，就像某人在还没有找到大门之前，面对着栅栏而感到的尴尬一样沉寂。"
"Michael rapidly reviewed the faces of the Board.","迈克尔迅速地观察了一下董事会成员们的脸。"
"Only one showed any animation.","只有一张脸表现出了一点儿生气。"
"It was concealed in a handkerchief.","这张脸掩盖在一张手帕后面。"
"The sound of the blown nose broke the spell.","一阵擤鼻子的声音打破了沉寂。"
"Two shareholders rose to their feet at once—one of them Michael’s neighbour on the right.","两个股东立刻站了起来——其中一个就是迈克尔右边的邻座。"
"“Mr. Sawdry,” said the Chairman, and the other shareholder sat down.","“索德利先生。”董事长说，于是另外那个股东坐了下来。"
"With a sonorous clearing of the throat, Michael’s neighbour turned his blunt red face towards Soames.","迈克尔的邻座响亮地清了清嗓子，把他那张生硬的红脸转向索姆斯。"
"“I wish to ask you, sir, why you didn’t inform the Board when you first ‘eard of this?”","“我想问您一下，先生，当您第一次听到这个消息的时候，为什么没有通知董事会？”"
"Soames rose slightly.","索姆斯微微起身。"
"“You are aware, I presume, that such an accusation, unless it can be fully substantiated, is a matter for criminal proceedings?”","“我相信您一定很清楚，如果没有充分的证据，这种告发行为是会引起刑事诉讼的吧？”"
"“No; it would ha’ been privileged.”","“不，这是可以获得豁免权的。”"
"“As between members of the Board, perhaps; but any leakage would have rendered us liable.","“在各位董事之间，也许是这样，但是任何消息的泄露都会使我们负有责任。"
"It was a mere case of word against word.”","这只不过是一件口说无凭的事情罢了。”"
"“Perhaps Sir Lawrence Mont will give us ‘is view of that?”","“也许劳伦斯·蒙特爵士会告诉我们他对这件事的看法吧？”"
"Michael’s heart began to beat.","迈克尔的心开始跳动起来。"
"There was an air of sprightliness about his father’s standing figure.","他父亲站在那里的姿态带有一种轻松愉快的样子。"
"“You must remember, sir,” he said, “that Mr. Elderson had enjoyed our complete confidence for many years; he was a gentleman, and, speaking for myself, an old schoolfellow of his, I preferred, in common loyalty, to give his word preference, while—er—keeping the matter in mind.”","“你一定记得，先生，”他说，“埃尔德森先生多年以来一直深受我们的信任，他是一个绅士，而且，就我个人而言，我是他的老同学，出于一般的忠诚，我更倾向于相信他的话，而——呃——把这件事记在心里。”"
"“Oh!” said Michael’s neighbour: “What’s the Chairman got to say about bein’ kept in the dark?”","“哦！”迈克尔的邻座说，“关于被蒙在鼓里，董事长有什么话要说吗？”"
"“We are all perfectly satisfied, sir, with the attitude of our co-directors, in a very delicate situation.","“在一种微妙的形势下，我们大家对于董事同僚们的态度，先生，是非常满意的。"
"You will kindly note that the mischief was already done over this unfortunate assurance, so that there was no need for undue haste.”","请您注意一下，在这笔不幸的保险业务上，损害已经造成了，所以没有必要过分性急。”"
"Michael saw his neighbour’s neck grow redder.","迈克尔看到他的邻座的脖子变得更红了。"
"“I don’t agree,” he said.","“我不同意这种说法，”他说，"
"“‘Wait and see’—We might have ‘ad that commission out of him, if he’d been tackled promptly.”","“‘静待观望形势’——如果能立刻把他抓住，我们可能已经把那笔佣金从他身上挖出来了。”"
"And he sat down.","说完他就坐了下来。"
"He had not reached mahogany before the thwarted shareholder had started up.","他还没来得及坐到红木椅子上，刚才那个被拦住的股东就突然跳了起来。"
"“Mr. Botterill,” said the Chairman.","“伯特利尔先生。”董事长说。"
"Michael saw a lean and narrow head, with two hollows in a hairy neck, above a back slightly bent forward, as of a doctor listening to a chest.","迈克尔看到一个又瘦又窄的脑袋，长毛的脖子上有两处凹陷，背部微微前倾，就像一个医生正在听诊胸部。"
"“I take it from you, then, sir,” he said, “that these two directors represent the general attitude of the Board, and that the Board were content to allow a suspected person to remain manager.","“那么，先生，听了您的话我的理解是，”他说，“这两位董事代表了董事会的总体态度，而董事会甘愿让一个可疑的人继续担任经理。"
"The gentleman on your extreme left—Mr. Forsyte, I think—spoke of an accidental incident.","在您最左边的那位先生——福赛特先生，我想是——说到过一件意外的事情。"
"But for that, apparently, we should still be in the hands of an unscrupulous individual.","如果没有那件事，很显然，我们仍然会处于一个无耻之徒的掌握之中。"
"The symptoms in this case are very disquieting.","这件事情的种种迹象非常令人不安。"
"There appears to have been gross over-confidence; a recent instance of the sort must be in all our minds.","这其中似乎存在严重的过度自信。最近出现的这个事例，我们必须谨记在心。"
"The policy of assuring foreign business was evidently initiated by the manager for his own ends.","承保国外业务的方针政策显然是那位经理出于自己的目的而发起的。"
"We have made a severe loss by it.","我们因此遭受了严重的损失。"
"And the question for us shareholders would seem to be whether a Board who placed confidence in such a person, and continued it after their suspicions were aroused, are the right people to direct this important concern.”","而我们这些股东们面临的问题似乎是，一个对这样一个人给予信任，并且在引起他们的怀疑之后还继续给予他信任的董事会，究竟是不是管理这个重要的公司的合适人选。”"
"Throughout this speech Michael had grown very hot.","在这段发言的整个过程中，迈克尔越听火气越大。"
"‘“Old Forsyte” was right,’ he thought; ‘they’re on their uppers after all.’","“‘老福赛特’说得对，”他想，“毕竟他们快要走投无路了。”"
"There was a sudden creak from his neighbour on the left.","他左边的邻座突然发出一阵嘎吱嘎吱的声音。"
"“Mr. Tolby,” said the Chairman.","“托尔比先生。”董事长说。"
"“It’s a seerious matter, this, gentlemen.","“这是一件严重的事情，这件事，先生们。"
"I propose that the Board withdraw, an’ leave us to discuss it.”","我提议董事会退席，我们留下来讨论这件事情。”"
"“I second that,” said Michael’s neighbour on the right.","“我赞成。”迈克尔右边的邻座说。"
"Searching the vista of the Board, Michael saw recognition gleam for a second in the lonely face at the end, and grinned a greeting.","迈克尔察看着董事会那一长排人，看到在排尾那张孤寂的脸上闪过一丝认出他的神情，于是他咧嘴笑着打招呼。"
"The Chairman was speaking.","董事长正在说话。"
"“If that is your wish, gentlemen, we shall be happy to comply with it.","“如果你们希望这样，先生们，我们乐于遵命。"
"Will those who favour the motion hold up their hands?”","请赞成这个提议的人举一下手好吗？”"
"All hands were held up, with the exception of Michael’s, of two women whose eager colloquy had not permitted them to hear the request, and of one shareholder, just in front of Michael, so motionless that he seemed to be dead.","所有的人都举起了手，除了迈克尔，还有因在专心谈话而没有听到这个请求的两位女士，以及坐在迈克尔正前方的一个股东，他一动也不动，好像死了一样。"
"“Carried,” said the Chairman, and rose from his seat.","“通过。”董事长说，然后就从座位上站了起来。"
"Michael saw his father smiling, and speaking to ‘Old Forsyte’ as they both stood up.","迈克尔看到他的父亲正在微笑，他在和“老福赛特”说着话，两个人都站了起来。"
"They all filed out, and the door was closed.","他们都陆续退了出去，然后那扇门就关上了。"
"‘Whatever happens,’ Michael thought, ‘I’ve got to keep my head shut, or I shall be dropping a brick.’","“无论发生什么事情，”迈克尔想，“我一定要保持镇定，否则我会闯祸的。”"
"“Perhaps the Press will kindly withdraw, too,” he heard some one say.","“新闻界也请退席吧。”他听到有人说。"
"With a general chinny movement, as if enquiring their rights of no one in particular, the four Pressmen could be seen to clasp their notebooks.","那四位记者都动了动下巴，仿佛是在询问他们是否没有特权似的，只见他们合上了笔记本。"
"When their pale reluctance had vanished, there was a stir among the shareholders, like that of ducks when a dog comes up behind.","当他们那几张苍白勉强的脸消失之后，股东们中间掀起了一阵骚乱，就像一群鸭子后面有一条狗追赶了上来似的。"
"Michael saw why, at once.","迈克尔立刻看出了原因。"
"They had their backs to each other.","他们彼此都背对着背。"
"A shareholder said:","一个股东说："
"“Perhaps Mr. Tolby, who proposed the withdrawal, will act as Chairman.”","“或许提议董事会退席的托尔比先生可以担当主席。”"
"Michael’s left-hand neighbour began breathing heavily.","迈克尔左边的邻座呼吸开始变得沉重起来。"
"“Right-o!” he said.","“好啊！”他说，"
"“Any one who wants to speak, kindly ketch my eye.”","“哪一位要发言，请示意我。”"
"Everyone now began talking to his neighbour, as though to get at once a quiet sense of proportion, before speaking.","这时每一个人都开始和邻座的人交谈起来，仿佛是要在发言之前立刻获得一种平静的分寸感。"
"Mr. Tolby was breathing so heavily that Michael felt a positive draught.","托尔比先生呼吸如此沉重，使得迈克尔都能感受到他呼出的一阵阵气浪。"
"“‘Ere, gentlemen,” he said suddenly, “this won’t do!","“呃，先生们，”他突然说，“这样不行啊！"
"We don’t want to be too formal, but we must preserve some order.","我们不需要太正式，但是我们必须保持点儿秩序。"
"I’ll open the discussion myself.","我自己来给讨论开个头吧。"
"Now, I didn’t want to ‘urt the feelin’s of the Board by plain speakin’ in their presence.","嗯，我不想当着董事会的面把话说得太直白，以免伤了他们的感情。"
"But, as Mr. What’s-’is-name there, said: The public ‘as got to protect itself against sharpers, and against slackness.","但是，正如刚才那里的某一位先生所说的：公众必须保护自己以防骗子欺诈，并且防止松懈懒散。"
"We all know what ‘appened the other day, and what’ll ‘appen again in other concerns, unless we shareholders look after ourselves.","我们大家都知道前些日子发生了什么事情，以及以后在其他公司还会发生什么事情，除非我们股东自己照顾自己。"
"In the first place, then, what I say is: They ought never to ‘ave touched anything to do with the ‘Uns.","那么，首先，我要说的是：凡是和德国佬有关的事情，他们根本就不应该碰。"
"In the second place, I say they showed bad judgment.","其次，我要说他们表现出拙劣的判断力。"
"And in the third place I say they were too thick together.","第三，我要说他们的关系太亲密了。"
"In my opinion, we should propose a vote of no confidence.”","在我看来，我们应该提议投不信任票。”"
"Cries of: “Hear, hear!” mixed with indeterminate sounds, were broken sharply by a loud: “No!” from the shareholder who had seemed dead.","与许多模糊不清的声音混杂着一起的“说得好，说得好！”的叫喊声，，突然被一声响亮的“反对”打破了，这是那个好像死了一样的股东喊出来的。"
"Michael’s heart went out to him, the more so as he still seemed dead.","迈克尔对他充满了好感，尤其是当他仍然好像死了一样一动不动时，这种好感便越发强烈了。"
"The negative was followed by the rising of a thin, polished-looking shareholder, with a small grey moustache.","随着这个否定的喊声，站起来一位瘦削文雅的、留着灰白色小胡子的股东。"
"“If you’ll forgive my saying so, sir,” he began, “your proposal seems to me very rough-and-ready justice.","“但愿您能原谅我这么说，先生，”他开始说道，“在我看来，您的建议似乎是一种甚为勉强的评判。"
"I should be interested to know how you would have handled such a situation if you had been on the Board.","我很想知道，如果您是董事会的成员，您将会如何处理这种局面。"
"It is extremely easy to condemn other people!”","谴责别人是非常容易的！”"
"“Hear, hear!” said Michael, astonished at his own voice.","“说得好，说得好！”迈克尔说，他对自己的声音感到惊讶。"
"“It is all very well,” the polished shareholder went on, “when any thing of this sort happens, to blame a directorate, but, speaking as a director myself, I should be glad to know whom one is to trust, if not one’s manager.","“发生了这种事情，”这位文雅的股东继续说，“去责备董事会是很容易的，但是，我自己作为一个董事而言，我很想知道，如果我不信任经理，又该信任谁。"
"As to the policy of foreign insurance, it has been before us at two general meetings; and we have pocketed the profit from it for nearly two years.","至于国外保险业务的方针政策，我们已经在两次股东大会上研究过了，而且我们由此获利已经差不多两年了。"
"Have we raised a voice against it?”","我们可曾对此提出过反对吗？”"
"The dead shareholder uttered a “No!” so loud that Michael almost patted his head.","那个死了一样的股东喊了一声“反对！”，那声音如此响亮，以至于迈克尔几乎要拍拍他的脑袋表示赞许。"
"The shareholder, whose neck and back were like a doctor’s, rose to answer.","那个颈部和背部像一个医生似的股东站起来回答了。"
"“I differ from the last speaker in his diagnosis of the case.","“我不同意刚才那位发言人对这个事件的判断。"
"Let us admit all he says, and look at the thing more widely.","我们姑且承认他所说的一切，同时从更加广泛的角度来看它。"
"The proof of pudding is in the eating.","布丁好不好吃，要吃了才知道。"
"When a Government makes a bad mistake of judgment, the electorate turns against it as soon as it feels the effects.","当一个政府在判断上出现了严重的错误，选民一旦感受到了它的后果，就会反对它。"
"This is a very sound check on administration; it may be rough and ready, but it is the less of two evils.","这是对于行政管理的一种非常合情合理的遏制。这种做法可能是差强人意的，但却是两害取其轻的做法。"
"A Board backs its judgment; when it loses, it should pay.","董事会支持自己的判断，当它失败了，它应该付出代价。"
"I think, perhaps, Mr. Tolby, being our informal Chairman, was out of order in proposing a vote of no confidence; if that be so, I should be happy to do so, myself.”","我认为，托尔比先生作为我们的非正式的董事长，提议投不信任票或许是有违议事规程的。如果一定要那样做的话，我自己很乐于对此投同样的不信任票。”"
"The dead shareholder’s “No!” was so resounding this time that there was a pause for him to speak; he remained, however, without motion.","那位死了一样的股东这次喊出的“反对！”如此响亮，以至于大家都停下来等他发言，然而，他还是一动不动。"
"Both of Michael’s neighbours were on their feet.","迈克尔两边的邻座都站了起来。"
"They bobbed at each other over Michael’s head, and Mr. Tolby sat down.","他们在迈克尔的头顶上互相谦让了一下，之后托尔比先生坐了下来。"
"“Mr. Sawdry,” he said.","“索德利先生。”他说。"
"“Look ‘ere, gentlemen,” said Mr. Sawdry, “and ladies, this seems to me a case for compromise.","“请注意，先生们，”索德利先生说，“女士们，在我看来，这件事得采取妥协的办法。"
"The Directors that knew about the manager ought to go; but we might stop at that.","那些了解经理的董事们应该离开，但是我们可以到此为止。"
"The gentleman in front of me keeps on saying ‘No.’","我前面的这位先生一直说‘反对’。"
"Let ‘im give us ‘is views.”","让他告诉我们他的意见。”"
"“No,” said the dead shareholder, but less loudly.","“反对。”那位死了一样的股东说，但是声音不那么响亮了。"
"“If a man can’t give ‘is views,” went on Mr. Sawdry, nearly sitting down on Michael, “‘c shouldn’t interrupt, in my opinion.”","“如果一个人不提出自己的意见，”索德利先生接着说，差一点儿坐到迈克尔的身上，“我认为，他就不应该打岔。”"
"A shareholder in the front row now turned completely round so that he faced the meeting.","前排的一个股东现在完全转过身来，面对着会场。"
"“I think,” he said, “that to prolong this discussion is to waste time; we are evidently in two, if not three, minds.","“我认为，”他说，“再讨论下去就是浪费时间。很显然，我们即使没有三种意见，也有两种。"
"The whole of the business of this country is now conducted on a system of delegated trust; it may be good, it may be bad—but there it is.","我们这个国家的一切事务目前都是按照委任信托制度进行的。这可能是好的，但也可能是不好的——但是情况就是这样。"
"You’ve got to trust somebody.","你不得不信任某个人。"
"Now, as to this particular case, we’ve had no reason to distrust the Board, so far; and, as I take it, the Board had no previous reason to distrust the late manager.","现在，关于这件特定的事情，到目前为止，我们没有理由不信任董事会。而且，在我看来，董事会之前也没有理由不信任前任经理。"
"I think it’s going too far, at present, to propose anything definite like a vote of no confidence; it seems to me that we should call the Board in and hear what assurances they have to give us against a repetition of anything of the sort in the future.”","目前提出诸如投不信任票之类的明确措施，我认为那样太过分了。我觉得我们应该把董事会成员叫进来，听一听他们必须给我们什么保证，以防将来再发生类似的事情。”"
"The sounds which greeted this moderate speech were so inextricable that Michael could not get the sense of them.","这番温和的发言所引起的反响是如此错综复杂，迈克尔无法听出他们的意思。"
"Not so with the speech which followed.","接下来的发言情况就不同了。"
"It came from a shareholder on the right, with reddish hair, light eyelashes, a clipped moustache, and a scraped colour.","那是右边的一个股东讲的，他长着浅红色的头发，淡淡的睫毛，胡子修剪得整整齐齐，脸刮得很干净。"
"“I have no objection whatever to having the Board in,” he said in a rather jeering voice, “and passing a vote of no confidence in their presence.","“我一点儿也不反对把董事会成员们叫进来，”他用一种十分嘲弄的声调说，“并且要当着他们的面投不信任票。"
"There is a question, which no one has touched on, of how far, if we turn them out, we could make them liable for this loss.","有一个问题还没有人提到，就是如果我们把他们赶出去，我们还能让他们对这笔损失承担多大的责任。"
"The matter is not clear, but there is a good sporting chance, if we like to take it.","这个问题现在还不清楚，但是如果我们愿意抓住这次机会的话，这会是一个很公平的机会。"
"Whereas, if we don’t turn them out, it’s obvious we can’t take it, even if we wish.”","反之，如果我们不把他们赶出去，即使我们想抓住机会，我们显然也抓不住了。”"
"The impression made by this speech was of quite a different order from any of the others.","此番发言给人们留下的印象和以前所有的发言完全不同。"
"It was followed by a hush, as though something important had been said at last.","这之后是一阵沉默，仿佛终于有人说出重要的话了。"
"Michael stared at Mr. Tolby.","迈克尔盯着托尔比先生。"
"The stout man’s round, light, rather prominent eye was extraordinarily reflective.","这个矮胖子那相当突出的浅色圆眼睛充满了深邃的思考。"
"‘Trout must look like that,’ thought Michael, ‘when they see a mayfly.’","“当鲑鱼看到蜉蝣的时候，”迈克尔想，“它们的眼睛一定是这个样子。”"
"Mr. Tolby suddenly stood up.","托尔比先生突然站了起来。"
"“All right,” he said, “‘ave ‘em in!”","“好吧，”他说，“叫他们进来！”"
"“Yes,” said the dead shareholder.","“好。”那个死了一样的股东说。"
"There was no dissent.","没有人表示反对。"
"Michael saw some one rise and ascend the platform.","迈克尔看到有人站了起来，登上平台。"
"“Let the Press know!” said Mr. Tolby.","“通知记者们！”托尔比先生说。"

"Chapter XIII","第十三章"
"Soames at Bay","索姆斯陷入绝境"
"When the door had closed behind the departing directors, Soames sought a window as far as possible from the lunch eaten before the meeting.","当董事们离开会场，关上门之后，索姆斯找了一个窗户，尽可能来消化在开会前吃的那顿午饭。"
"“Funeral baked meats, eh, Forsyte?” said a voice in his ear.","“葬礼中剩下的残羹冷炙，呃，福赛特？”他的耳边有一个声音说，"
"“Our number’s up, I think.","“我想我们的气数已尽了。"

"I think he ought to ask for a second shirt!”","我想他应该要求第二件衬衫了！”"
"Soames’ tenacity began wriggling within him.","索姆斯的执拗脾气开始发作了。"
"“The thing wants tackling,” he grumbled; “the Chairman’s not the man for the job!”","“这件事需要着手解决，”他喃喃地说，“董事长不是做这件事的合适人选！”"
"Shades of old Uncle Jolyon!","让人想起老乔里恩叔叔啊！"
"He would have made short work of this!","他一定能迅速解决这件事！"
"It wanted a masterful hand.","这需要强有力的手腕。"
"“Warning to us all, Forsyte, against loyalty!","“这是警告我们大家，福赛特，不要讲忠诚了。"
"It’s not in the period.","这不合时宜。"
"Ah!","啊！"
"Fontenoy!”","福坦诺！”"
"Soames became conscious of features rather above the level of his own.","索姆斯意识到有一个比他高的人在旁边。"
"“Well, Mr. Forsyte, hope you’re satisfied?","“哦，福赛特先生，你满意了吧？"
"A pretty damned mess!","这可真是该死的一团糟！"
"If I’d been the Chairman, I’d never have withdrawn.","如果我是董事长，我决不会退席。"
"Always keep hounds under your eye, Mont.","要时刻看住你的猎犬，蒙特。"
"Take it off, and they’ll go for you!","目光一离开，它们就会袭击你！"
"Wish I could get among ‘em with a whip; I’d give it those two heavy pug-faced chaps—they mean business!","真希望我能拿着鞭子跑到他们中间去，我要抽那两个哈巴狗脸似的胖家伙——他们是存心这样做的！"
"Unless you’ve got something up your sleeve, Mr. Forsyte, we’re dished.”","除非您有什么锦囊妙计，福赛特先生，否则我们就完蛋了。”"
"“What should I have up my sleeve?” said Soames coldly.","“我会有什么妙计？”索姆斯冷冷地说。"
"“Damn it, sir, you put the chestnuts in the fire; it’s up to you to pull ‘em out.","“真该死，先生，是你把栗子放进火里去的，应该由你把它们取出来。"
"I can’t afford to lose these fees!”","我可承受不起这笔酬劳费的损失！”"
"Soames heard Sir Lawrence murmur: “Crude, my dear Fontenoy!” and said with malice:","索姆斯听到劳伦斯爵士喃喃地说：“太粗鲁了，我亲爱的福坦诺！”于是他恶毒地说："
"“You may lose more than your fees!”","“也许你损失的不只是你的酬劳费！”"
"“Can’t!","“不可能！"
"They may have Eaglescourt tomorrow, and take a loss off my hands.”","也许明天他们就会成立鹰庭，承担我的损失。”"
"A gleam of feeling burned up suddenly in the old eyes: “The country drives you to the wall, skins you to the bone, and expects you to give ‘em public service gratis.","那双苍老的眼睛里突然燃起了同情的闪光：“国家把你逼得走投无路，把你剥得只剩骨头，还指望你无偿地为他们提供公共服务。"
"Can’t be done, Mont—can’t be done!”","办不到，蒙特——办不到！”"
"Soames turned away; he had an utter disinclination for talk, like one standing before an open grave, watching a coffin slowly lowered.","索姆斯转过身去，他完全不想说话，就像一个人站在敞开的墓穴前面，看着一口棺材慢慢地放下去。"
"Here was his infallibility going—going!","他那一贯正确的名声就这样完了——完了！"
"He had no illusions.","他不抱任何幻想。"
"It would all be in the papers, and his reputation for sound judgment gone for ever!","这件事会刊登在各家报纸上，他以出众的决断力而闻名的声誉一去不复返了！"
"Bitter!","真痛苦！"
"No more would the Forsytes say: “Soames says—” No more would old Gradman follow him with eyes like an old dog’s, grudging sometimes, but ever submitting to infallibility.","福赛特家的人再也不会说“索姆斯说——”了。老格雷德曼再也不会用那双像老狗一样忠诚的眼睛追随着他了，尽管有时候有些勉强，但是始终服从他那一贯正确的判断。"
"It would be a nasty jar for the old fellow.","这将使那个老家伙大为震惊。"
"His business acquaintances—after all, they were not many, now!—would no longer stare with envious respect.","他那些生意上的熟人——毕竟，现在不太多了！——再也不会用羡慕而尊敬的目光注视他了。"
"He wondered if the reverberations would reach Dumetrius, and the picture market!","他不知道这些反响会不会传到杜梅特里斯以及绘画市场上！"
"The sole comfort was: Fleur needn’t know.","唯一的安慰是：不必让弗勒知道。"
"Fleur!","弗勒！"
"Ah!","啊！"
"If only her business were safely over!","但愿她能平安顺利地生产！"
"For a moment his mind became empty of all else.","他的脑子里有一会儿只想着这件事，其他的什么都不想。"
"Then with a rush the present filled it up again.","接着，眼前的事情又突然一下子充满了他的脑子。"
"Why were they all talking as if there were a corpse in the room?","为什么他们讲话的时候都好像房间里有一具死尸似的呢？"
"Well!","哦！"
"There was—the corpse of his infallibility!","确实有——就是他那一贯正确的死尸！"
"As for monetary loss—that seemed secondary, remote, incredible—like a future life.","至于金钱上的损失——那似乎是次要的、遥远的、难以置信的——就像来世一样。"
"Mont had said something about loyalty.","蒙特说过一些关于忠诚的话。"
"He didn’t know what loyalty had to do with it!","他不知道这件事和忠诚有什么关系！"
"But if they thought he was going to show any white feather, they were extremely mistaken.","但是如果他们认为他会示弱的话，那他们就大错特错了。"
"Acid courage welled up into his brain.","他的心中涌起了犀利的勇气。"
"Shareholders, directors—they might howl and shake their fists; he was not going to be dictated to.","股东们，董事们——他们或许会咆哮怒吼并挥舞着拳头，但他不会任人摆布的。"
"He heard a voice say:","他听到一个声音说："
"“Will you come in, please, gentlemen?”","“请你们进来好吗，先生们？”"
"Taking his seat again before his unused quill, he noticed the silence—shareholders waiting for directors, directors for shareholders.","他又在那支他从未用过的鹅毛笔前坐了下来，他注意到全场一片沉寂——股东们在等着董事们发言，而董事们在等着股东们发言。"
"“Wish I could get among ‘em with a whip!”","“真希望我能拿着鞭子跑到他们中间去！”"
"Extravagant words of that ‘old guinea-pig’s,’ but expressive, somehow!","这是那个“老豚鼠”说的放肆话，但是不知怎么的，很有表现力！"
"At last the Chairman, whose voice always reminded Soames of a raw salad with oil poured over it, said ironically:","最后，董事长讽刺地说，他的声音总是让索姆斯想起一种上面浇过油的生沙拉："
"“Well, gentlemen, we await your pleasure.”","“哦，先生们，我们在等各位的指示呢。”"
"That stout, red-faced fellow, next to Michael, stood up, opening his pug’s mouth.","坐在迈克尔旁边的那个红脸矮胖子站了起来，张开了他那哈巴狗似的嘴。"
"“To put it shortly, Mr. Chairman, we’re not at all satisfied; but before we take any resolution, we want to ‘ear what you’ve got to say.”","“简单地说，董事长先生，我们一点儿也不满意。但是在我们做出任何决议之前，我们想要听一听你们有什么要说的。”"
"Just below Soames, some one jumped up and added: “We’d like to know, sir, what assurances you can offer us against anything of this sort in the future.”","就在索姆斯的下面，一个人跳了起来，补充道：“我们想要知道，先生，你们能向我们做出什么样的保证，以避免今后再发生这种事情。”"
"Soames saw the Chairman smile—no real backbone in that fellow!","索姆斯看到董事长在微笑——那个家伙没有真正的骨气！"
"“In the nature of things, sir,” he said, “none whatever!","“从道理上讲，先生，”他说，“什么保证也没有！"
"You can hardly suppose that if we had known our manager was not worthy of our confidence, we should have continued him in the post for a moment!”","你总不至于认为，如果我们已经知道了我们的经理不值得我们信任，我们还会继续让他担任这个职务吧！”"
"Soames thought: ‘That won’t do—he’s gone back on himself!’","索姆斯想：“这样说可不行——他的话自相矛盾了！”"
"Yes, and that other pug-faced chap had seen it!","果然，另外那一个哈巴狗脸似的家伙看出了这一点！"
"“That’s just the point, sir,” he was saying: “Two of you DID know, and yet, there the fellow was for months afterwards, playin’ ‘is own ‘and, cheatin’ the Society for all he was worth, I shouldn’t wonder.”","“关键就在这里，先生，”他说，“你们中间有两个人的确知道，然而，这个家伙之后又干了几个月，为他自己牟利，竭尽全力地欺骗公司，我觉得这不足为奇。”"
"One after another, they were yelping now:","此时他们一个接一个地都在叫嚷："
"“What about your own words?”","“你们自己说过的话算不算数？”"
"“You admitted collective responsibility.”","“你们应承过会集体负责的。”"
"“You said you were perfectly satisfied with the attitude of your co-directors in the matter.”","“你们说过，你们对于董事同僚们在这件事情上的态度是非常满意的。”"
"Regular pack!","真是一群疯狗！"
"Soames saw the Chairman incline his head as if he wanted to shake it; old Fontenoy muttering, old Mothergill blowing his nose, Meyricke shrugging his sharp shoulders.","索姆斯看到董事长低下头，好像要摇头的样子，老福坦诺在喃喃自语，老马瑟吉尔在擤鼻子，梅里克在耸着他那瘦削的肩膀。"
"Suddenly he was cut off from view of them—Sir Lawrence was standing up between.","突然他观察他们的视线被挡住——劳伦斯爵士在中间站了起来。"
"“Allow me a word!","“请允许我说一句话！"
"Speaking for myself, I find it impossible to accept the generous attempt of the Chairman to shoulder a responsibility which clearly rests on me.","就我自己而言，董事长试图慷慨地承担明显应该由我负起的责任，对此我不能接受。"
"If I made a mistake of judgment in not disclosing our suspicions, I must pay the penalty; and I think it will clear the—er—situation if I tender my resignation to the meeting.”","如果我在没有公开我们的怀疑这一点上做出了错误的判断，那么我应该受到处罚，而且我认为如果我向大会提交辞呈，那将会使——呃——局势明朗一点儿。”"
"Soames saw him give a little bow, place his monocle in his eye, and sit down.","索姆斯看到他微微鞠了一躬，把他的单片眼镜架在眼睛前，然后坐了下来。"
"A murmur greeted the words—approval, surprise, deprecation, admiration?","这番话引起了阵阵私语——是赞成、惊讶、反对，还是佩服呢？"
"It had been gallantly done.","这件事做得很勇敢。"
"Soames distrusted gallantry—there was always a dash of the peacock about it.","索姆斯不相信勇敢的行为——总有一点儿炫耀的意思。"
"He felt curiously savage.","他感到莫名其妙的愤怒。"

"Very good!","很好！"
"I am not conscious of having done anything but my duty from beginning to end of this affair.","这件事从头至尾，我觉得除了尽了我的职责之外，我没有做过任何事情。"
"I am confident that I made no mistake of judgment.","我确信我没有做出错误的判断。"
"And I consider it entirely unjust that I should be penalised.","而且我认为，如果我受到处罚，那是完全不公正的。"
"I have had worry and anxiety enough, without being made a scapegoat by shareholders who accepted this policy without a murmur, before ever I came on the Board, and are now angry because they have lost by it.","在我加入董事会之前，股东们已经毫无异议地接受了这项方针政策，现在他们因遭受了损失就发起脾气来，要拿我当替罪羊，即便他们不这样做，我也已经够担心和焦虑的了。"
"You owe it to me that the policy has been dropped: You owe it to me that you have no longer a fraudulent person for a manager.","多亏了我，这项方针政策才被放弃了：多亏了我，你们才不再让一个骗子当经理。"
"And you owe it to me that you were called together today to pass judgment on the matter.","还是多亏了我，你们今天才被召集到一起，对这件事作出判断。"
"I have no intention whatever of singing small.","我一点儿也不想变得沉默寡言。"
"But there is another aspect to this affair.","但是这件事还有另外一方面。"
"I am not prepared to go on giving my services to people who don’t value them.","对于那些不重视我的服务的人，我不准备继续为他们效劳了。"
"I have no patience with the attitude displayed this afternoon.","我无法容忍今天下午他们表现出来的这种态度。"
"If any one here thinks he has a grievance against me, let him bring an action.","如果这里有任何一个人对我不满的话，那就让他去起诉好了。"
"I shall be happy to carry it to the House of Lords, if necessary.","如果有必要的话，我很乐意把这场官司打到上议院去。"
"I have been familiar with the City all my life, and I have not been in the habit of meeting with suspicions and ingratitude.","我这一辈子非常熟悉这座城市，我可不习惯遭到怀疑，或者与背信弃义的人有来往。"
"If this is an instance of present manners, I have been familiar with the City long enough.","如果这就是当今的风俗的话，那我对这座城市熟悉得也够久了。"
"I do not tender my resignation to the meeting; I resign.”","我不向大会提交辞呈，我这就辞职。”"
"Bowing to the Chairman, and pushing back his chair, he walked doggedly to the door, opened it and passed through.","他向董事长鞠了个躬，把椅子往后一推，固执地走到门口，打开门就走了出去。"
"He sought his hat.","他寻找他的帽子。"
"He had not the slightest doubt but that he had astonished their weak nerves!","他毫不怀疑，他已经使他们那脆弱的神经大为震惊！"
"Those pug-faced fellows had their mouths open!","那些哈巴狗脸似的家伙们张着嘴！"
"He would have liked to see what he had left behind, but it was hardly consistent with dignity to open the door again.","他很想看一看他引起了什么反应，但是再把门打开是有失尊严的。"
"He took a sandwich instead, and began to eat it with his back to the door and his hat on.","他转而拿起一块三明治，背朝着房门，戴着帽子，开始吃了起来。"
"He felt better than he had for months.","他觉得几个月以来从没有这么轻松过。"
"A voice said:","一个声音说："
"“‘And the subsequent proceedings interested him no more!’","“‘接下来的议程不会使他感兴趣了！’"
"I’d no idea, Forsyte, you were such an orator!","我以前不知道，福赛特，你竟是这样一位演说家！"
"You gave it ‘em between the eyes!","你击中了他们的要害！"
"Never saw a meeting so knocked out!","从来没有见过一个会议如此令人震惊！"
"Well, you’ve saved the Board by focussing their resentment entirely on yourself.","哦，你把他们的怨恨全部集中在你自己身上，从而拯救了董事会。"
"It was very gallant, Forsyte!”","这样做非常英勇，福赛特！”"
"Soames growled through his sandwich:","索姆斯一边吃着三明治，一边愤愤地说："
"“Nothing of the sort!","“绝无此事！"
"Are you out, too?”","你也不干了吗？”"
"“Yes.","“是的。"
"I pressed my resignation.","我坚决要辞职。"
"That red-faced fellow was proposing a vote of confidence in the Board when I left—and they’ll pass it, Forsyte—they’ll pass it!","我离开的时候，那个红脸的家伙正在提议对董事会投信任票——他们会通过的，福赛特——他们会通过的！"
"Something was said about financial liability, by the way!”","顺便说一下，他们还说到了有关经济责任的问题！”"
"“Was there?” said Soames, with a grim smile: “That cock won’t fight.","“是吗？”索姆斯冷酷地微笑着说，“那一招不管用。"
"Their only chance was to claim against the Board for initiating foreign assurance ultra vires; if they’re re-affirming the Board, after the question’s been raised in open meeting, they’re dished.","他们唯一的机会就是提出董事会创办国外保险业务是越权行为。如果这个问题在公开大会上提出之后，他们重新确认了董事会，那他们就完蛋了。"
"Nothing’ll lie against you and me, for not disclosing our suspicions—that’s certain.”","没有任何理由可以起诉你和我，说我们没有公开我们的怀疑——那是肯定的。”"
"“A relief, I confess,” said Sir Lawrence, with a sigh.","“我承认，这的确让我如释重负，”劳伦斯爵士叹了一口气说道，"
"“It was the speech of your life, Forsyte!”","“这是你一生中最精彩的演讲，福赛特！”"
"Perfectly well aware of that, Soames shook his head.","索姆斯非常明白这一点，但他摇了摇头。"
"Apart from the horror of seeing himself in print, he was beginning to feel that he had been extravagant.","除了害怕在报纸上见到自己的名字以外，他开始觉得自己做得太过分了。"
"It was always a mistake to lose your temper!","发脾气总是不对的！"
"A bitter little smile came on his lips.","他的嘴角露出一丝苦笑。"
"Nobody, not even Mont, would see how unjustly he had been treated.","没有一个人，甚至蒙特，会明白他受到了多么不公平的待遇。"
"“Well,” he said, “I shall go.”","“哦，”他说，“我要走了。”"
"“I think I shall wait, Forsyte, and hear the upshot.”","“我想我要等一会儿，福赛特，听一听结果如何。”"
"“Upshot?","“结果？"
"They’ll appoint two other fools, and slaver over each other.","他们会任命另外两个傻瓜，然后互相奉承一番。"
"Shareholders!","股东们！"
"Good-bye!”","再见吧！”"
"He moved to the door.","他朝门口走去。"

"His acumen, his judgment, his manner of dealing with affairs—aspersed!","他的聪明、他的判断力、他处理问题的方式——都遭到了中伤！"
"They didn’t like it; well—he would leave it!","他们不喜欢，好吧——到此为止吧！"
"Catch him meddling, in future!","看他以后还多管闲事！"
"It was all of a piece with the modern state of things.","这和现代事物的状态是完全一致的。"
"Hand to mouth, and the steady men pushed to the wall!","过一天算一天，而稳健的人却被逼上绝路！"
"The men to whom a pound was a pound, and not a mess of chance and paper.","对这种人而言，一英镑就是一英镑，不是一堆乱七八糟的机会和纸张。"
"The men who knew that the good of the country was the strict, straight conduct of their own affairs.","这种人知道，对国家有利的事情就是严格、直接地管理好自己的事物。"
"They were not wanted.","现在不需要这种人了。"
"One by one, they would get the go-by—as he had got it—in favour of Jack-o’-lanterns, revolutionaries, restless chaps, or clever, unscrupulous fellows, like Elderson.","他们会一个接一个地被人冷落——正如他现在所遭受的那样——而得宠的却是那些捉摸不定的人、革命家、不安分守己的人，或者是那些聪明但不讲道德的人，就像埃尔德森那样。"
"It was in the air.","这已经成为一种风气了。"
"No amount of eating your cake and wanting to have it could take the place of common honesty.","贪得无厌取代了普通的诚实。"

"“Then I shan’t be seeing you so often, Mr. Soames; there’s never anything in Mr. Timothy’s.","“那么我就不会经常见到您了，索姆斯先生。蒂莫西先生的信托向来就没有什么事情。"

"Winifred alone represented for him now, the past; her solid nature never varied, however much she kept up with the fashions.","现在对他来说，只有威尼弗里德一个人代表着过去，她那可靠的性格从来没有改变过。"

"Parrots were coming in again.","鹦鹉现在又流行起来了。"
"The bird made a dreadful noise.","这只鸟发出了一阵非常讨厌的吵闹声。"
"Whether under its influence or that of the China tea—which, made in the English way, of a brand the Chinese grew for foreign stomachs, always upset him—he was soon telling her the whole story.","不知是受了鹦鹉的影响还是中国茶的影响——这种茶，是按照英国的方式泡制的，是中国人为了迎合外国人的口味而种植的一种品牌，总是使他感到不舒服——他很快就把整件事都告诉了她。"
"When he had finished, Winifred said comfortably:","等他说完了，威尼弗雷德愉快地说："
"“Well, Soames, I think you did splendidly; it serves them right!”","“嗯，索姆斯，我认为你干得很漂亮，他们活该如此！”"
"Conscious that his narrative must have presented the truth as it would not appear to the public, Soames muttered:","索姆斯知道他的叙述一定已经呈现了公众所不了解的事实真相，他喃喃地说："

"They had pitched on Old Forsyte, who, of all, was least to blame; for if Bart had only held his tongue, they would certainly have lumped him into the vote of confidence.","他们选中了老福赛特，而他在所有人当中，是最不应该受到谴责的。至于准爵爷，如果他能保持缄默，他们一定会把他归入信任票之列的。"
