The Fiddler of the Reels	拉里尔舞曲的小提琴手		
by Thomas Hardy	作者：托马斯·哈代		
‘Talking of Exhibitions, World’s Fairs, and what not,’ said the old gentleman, ‘I would not go round the corner to see a dozen of them nowadays.	“说到展览会、世界博览会这类东西，”老绅士说，“现在就算一出门就能看见十来个，我也不会去看了。		
The only exhibition that ever made, or ever will make, any impression upon my imagination was the first of the series, the parent of them all, and now a thing of old times—the Great Exhibition of 1851, in Hyde Park, London.	唯一给我留下印象，或者说唯一会给我留下印象的，是第一次博览会，它可是博览会的鼻祖。现在看来，它已经算是旧时的事物了——那就是1851年在伦敦海德公园举办的万国工业博览会。		
None of the younger generation can realize the sense of novelty it produced in us who were then in our prime.	没有一个年轻人能体会到它给当时正值壮年的我们带来的那种新奇感。		
A noun substantive went so far as to become an adjective in honour of the occasion.	为了纪念那次盛会，‘博览’一词风行一时，由名词变成了形容词。		
It was “exhibition” hat, “exhibition” razor-strop, “exhibition” watch; nay, even “exhibition” weather, “exhibition” spirits, sweethearts, babies, wives—for the time.	当时有‘博览’帽、‘博览’磨剃刀皮带、‘博览’手表；不仅如此，甚至还有‘博览’天气、‘博览’烈酒、‘博览’情侣、‘博览’婴儿、‘博览’妻子等等。		
‘For South Wessex, the year formed in many ways an extraordinary chronological frontier or transit-line, at which there occurred what one might call a precipice in Time.	“对南威塞克斯来说，从很多方面讲，那一年成了一条显著的时代分界线，或者说是转折线，发生了所谓的时代断层现象。		
As in a geological “fault,” we had presented to us a sudden bringing of ancient and modern into absolute contact, such as probably in no other single year since the Conquest was ever witnessed in this part of the country.’	正如地质‘断层’一样，我们突然把古今紧密地衔接起来。可能自诺曼征服以来，没有哪一年能比这一年更能体现这种衔接了。”		
These observations led us onward to talk of the different personages, gentle and simple, who lived and moved within our narrow and peaceful horizon at that time; and of three people in particular, whose queer little history was oddly touched at points by the Exhibition, more concerned with it than that of anybody else who dwelt in those outlying shades of the world, Stickleford, Mellstock, and Egdon.	这些话题引领我们去谈论各种高低贵贱的人物，他们在当时狭窄、平静的领域中生活、奔波和忙碌。这里要特别谈到三个人，他们不寻常的生活经历和万国工业博览会有些奇妙的联系。而且，与斯蒂克福德、梅尔斯托克、埃格顿等偏远地区的其他人相比，他们的生活经历和万国工业博览会的联系要紧密得多。		
First in prominence among these three came Wat Ollamoor—if that were his real name—whom the seniors in our party had known well.	这三人中首要的一个是沃特·奥拉莫尔——如果那是他的真实姓名的话——我们这伙人中年长的都很熟悉他。		
He was a woman’s man, they said,—supremely so—externally little else.	他们说他是个招女人喜欢的人——特别擅长于此——外表上没什么特别的。		
To men he was not attractive; perhaps a little repulsive at times.	在男人们看来，他一点儿都不吸引人，有时还有点儿让人讨厌。		
Musician, dandy, and company-man in practice; veterinary surgeon in theory, he lodged awhile in Mellstock village, coming from nobody knew where; though some said his first appearance in this neighbourhood had been as fiddle-player in a show at Greenhill Fair.	他是乐师、花花公子，也是一名在职的公司雇员；他懂些兽医知识，在梅尔斯托克村住过一阵子，谁都不知道他家乡是哪里；不过有人说他第一次在这附近亮相就是在格林希尔博览会上，他在一次表演中担任小提琴手。		
Many a worthy villager envied him his power over unsophisticated maidenhood—a power which seemed sometimes to have a touch of the weird and wizardly in it.	很多正派的村民都很羡慕他，因为他对不谙世事的女孩有着一种吸引力——这种吸引力有时似乎带有一丝怪异而神奇的色彩。		
Personally he was not ill-favoured, though rather un-English, his complexion being a rich olive, his rank hair dark and rather clammy—made still clammier by secret ointments, which, when he came fresh to a party, caused him to smell like ‘boys’-love’ (southernwood) steeped in lamp-oil.	就其个人而言，他长得并不难看，尽管他不太像英国人。他的肤色是深橄榄色的，头发很多，又黑又油腻——抹了神秘的油膏后就更加油腻了，这使得他刚出现在聚会时，闻起来像浸在灯油中的青蒿似的。		
On occasion he wore curls—a double row—running almost horizontally around his head.	有时他留卷发——卷成两层——几乎在他的脑袋上水平地绕一周。		
But as these were sometimes noticeably absent, it was concluded that they were not altogether of Nature’s making.	但是，有时这些卷发明显不见了，所以大家认定那卷发并非全是天生的。		
By girls whose love for him had turned to hatred he had been nicknamed ‘Mop,’ from this abundance of hair, which was long enough to rest upon his shoulders; as time passed the name more and more prevailed.	由于他的头发非常浓密，长及肩膀，那些对他由爱生恨的女孩们给他起了个绰号“大拖把”。时间一长，这绰号就流传开了。		
His fiddling possibly had the most to do with the fascination he exercised, for, to speak fairly, it could claim for itself a most peculiar and personal quality, like that in a moving preacher.	他的魅力可能与其琴技关系最大。因为平心而论，他的琴技本身极其特别，很有个性，正如牧师那令人感动的布道一样。		
There were tones in it which bred the immediate conviction that indolence and averseness to systematic application were all that lay between ‘Mop’ and the career of a second Paganini.	他拉出的曲调让人立刻相信，若不是懒惰成性，反感系统训练，“大拖把”就能成为帕格尼尼第二了。		
While playing he invariably closed his eyes; using no notes, and, as it were, allowing the violin to wander on at will into the most plaintive passages ever heard by rustic man.	演奏时，他总是闭着眼睛。他不用谱子，似乎在让小提琴任意发挥，奏出乡下人从未听过的哀伤乐曲。		
There was a certain lingual character in the supplicatory expressions he produced, which would well nigh have drawn an ache from the heart of a gate-post.	他奏出的曲子有一种类似人声的特质，诉说着心中的祈求，就连门柱听了都会心痛难安。		
He could make any child in the parish, who was at all sensitive to music, burst into tears in a few minutes by simply fiddling one of the old dance-tunes he almost entirely affected—country jigs, reels, and ‘Favourite Quick Steps’ of the last century—some mutilated remains of which even now reappear as nameless phantoms in new quadrilles and gallops, where they are recognized only by the curious, or by such old-fashioned and far-between people as have been thrown with men like Wat Ollamoor in their early life.	仅需拉一首古老的舞曲，他就可以使教区里稍有音乐天赋的孩子在几分钟内大哭起来。他喜欢几乎所有古老的舞曲——上世纪的乡村吉格舞曲、里尔舞曲以及“流行快步舞曲”。现在，其中一些残缺不全的乐曲片段甚至像无名的幽灵一样，重新出现在新的四对方舞曲和加洛普舞曲中。而只有那些有好奇心的人，或者那些早年和沃特·奥拉莫尔之类的人交往过的因循守旧的少数人才会辨认得出。		
His date was a little later than that of the old Mellstock quire-band which comprised the Dewys, Mail, and the rest—in fact, he did not rise above the horizon thereabout till those well-known musicians were disbanded as ecclesiastical functionaries.	他所处的年代比梅尔斯托克的老唱诗班乐团要晚一点儿，其成员包括德维兄弟、梅尔等人。实际上，直到那些著名乐师们不再为教会供职后，他才开始崭露头角。		
In their honest love of thoroughness they despised the new man’s style.	那些乐师挚爱严谨，因而他们瞧不上这个新来的人的风格。		
Theophilus Dewy (Reuben the tranter’s younger brother) used to say there was no ‘plumness’ in it—no bowing, no solidity—it was all fantastical.	西奥菲勒斯·德维（流动商贩鲁本的弟弟）曾经说他的琴技毫不“体面”——不运弓法、连续性差——完全荒诞不稽。		
And probably this was true.	这话也许不假。		
Anyhow, Mop had, very obviously, never bowed a note of church-music from his birth; he never once sat in the gallery of Mellstock church where the others had tuned their venerable psalmody so many hundreds of times; had never, in all likelihood, entered a church at all.	无论如何，显然，“大拖把”从出生起就从未演奏过一次教堂音乐；他从未坐在梅尔斯托克教堂的边座上，而其他人曾在那里把庄严的赞美诗奏唱过几百次。他很可能根本没进过教堂。		 
All were devil’s tunes in his repertory.	他的曲目全是恶魔之曲。		
‘He could no more play the Wold Hundredth to his true time than he could play the brazen serpent,’ the tranter would say.	“他连《赞美诗第一百首》都拉不好，就像他吹蛇形铜管一样差劲。”流动商贩会这么说。		
(The brazen serpent was supposed in Mellstock to be a musical instrument particularly hard to blow.)	（在梅尔斯托克，蛇形铜管是一种非常难吹奏的乐器。）		
Occasionally Mop could produce the aforesaid moving effect upon the souls of grown-up persons, especially young women of fragile and responsive organization.	有时，“大拖把”也能打动成年人的心，产生如前所述的效果，心思细腻敏感的年轻女子尤其如此。		
Such an one was Car’line Aspent.	卡罗琳·阿斯彭特就是这样的一个女人。		
Though she was already engaged to be married before she met him, Car’line, of them all, was the most influenced by Mop Ollamoor’s heart-stealing melodies, to her discomfort, nay, positive pain and ultimate injury.	尽管在遇到“大拖把”之前，卡罗琳已经订了婚，但是在所有这些女人中，她是受“大拖把”奥拉莫尔那勾魂的旋律影响最深的人。那旋律不仅使她不安，还给她带来极大的痛苦和致命的伤害。		
She was a pretty, invocating, weak-mouthed girl, whose chief defect as a companion with her sex was a tendency to peevishness now and then.	她漂亮，惹人怜爱，不善言辞。跟同性伴侣在一起时，她唯一的缺点是偶尔爱发发牢骚。		
At this time she was not a resident in Mellstock parish where Mop lodged, but lived some miles off at Stickleford, farther down the river.	那时，她并不是“大拖把”所在的梅尔斯托克教区的居民，她住在河流下游几英里外的斯蒂克福德。		
How and where she first made acquaintance with him and his fiddling is not truly known, but the story was that it either began or was developed on one spring evening, when, in passing through Lower Mellstock, she chanced to pause on the bridge near his house to rest herself, and languidly leaned over the parapet.	关于她是在何地如何结识他及其琴技的，实际上并不为人所知，但是据说这一切始于或源于一个春天的夜晚。当时，她经过下梅尔斯托克，恰好在他寓所附近的桥上停留歇息，无精打采地靠在栏杆上。		
Mop was standing on his door-step, as was his custom, spinning the insidious thread of semi- and demi-semi-quavers from the E string of his fiddle for the benefit of passers-by, and laughing as the tears rolled down the cheeks of the little children hanging around him.	像往常一样，“大拖把”站在门阶上，用小提琴的E弦为过路人拉奏出让人沉醉的十六分音符和三十二分音符的乐曲。当围在他身边久久不愿离去的小孩子们泪流满面时，他便欢笑起来。		
Car’line pretended to be engrossed with the rippling of the stream under the arches, but in reality she was listening, as he knew.	卡罗琳假装被桥洞下泛着涟漪的溪水吸引，其实却在聆听他奏出的音乐，这一点他很清楚。		
Presently the aching of the heart seized her simultaneously with a wild desire to glide airily in the mazes of an infinite dance.	不久，伴随着心的痛楚，她产生了一种强烈的欲望，想要在无尽的舞蹈迷宫中翩然起舞。		
To shake off the fascination she resolved to go on, although it would be necessary to pass him as he played.	为了摆脱这种诱惑，她决定继续向前走，尽管必须经过他的面前。		
On stealthily glancing ahead at the performer, she found to her relief that his eyes were closed in abandonment to instrumentation, and she strode on boldly.	她悄悄地瞥了一眼小提琴手，发现他闭着眼睛，沉浸在演奏中，便安下心来，大胆地大步向前走。		
But when closer her step grew timid, her tread convulsed itself more and more accordantly with the time of the melody, till she very nearly danced along.	但是离他近一点儿时，她的脚步又变得羞怯起来，步伐跳动着，与旋律的节奏越来越一致，简直就是踏着舞步向前走了。		
Gaining another glance at him when immediately opposite, she saw that one of his eyes was open, quizzing her as he smiled at her emotional state.	走到他正前方时，她又瞥了他一眼，看到他的一只眼睛睁着，用探究的目光看着她，同时嘲笑她激动的情绪。		
Her gait could not divest itself of its compelled capers till she had gone a long way past the house; and Car’line was unable to shake off the strange infatuation for hours.	直到离开那所房子很长一段距离，她的步伐才摆脱了不由自主的跳跃。好几个小时之后，卡罗琳才摆脱了那莫名的悸动。		
After that day, whenever there was to be in the neighbourhood a dance to which she could get an invitation, and where Mop Ollamoor was to be the musician, Car’line contrived to be present, though it sometimes involved a walk of several miles; for he did not play so often in Stickleford as elsewhere.	那天之后，每当附近有舞会，只要她能获得邀请，而且“大拖把”奥拉莫尔是舞会的伴奏者时，卡罗琳总是设法参加。由于他不常在斯蒂克福德演奏，卡罗琳有时要走好几英里，但她还是乐此不疲。		
The next evidences of his influence over her were singular enough, and it would require a neurologist to fully explain them.	还有一些能表明他对她的影响的迹象，它们相当奇异，可能需要一位神经科医师才能完全解释清楚。		
She would be sitting quietly, any evening after dark, in the house of her father, the parish clerk, which stood in the middle of Stickleford village street, this being the highroad between Lower Mellstock and Moreford, five miles eastward.	每天天黑后，她会静静地坐在身为教区执事的父亲的房子里。房子位于斯蒂克福德村街道中部，这条街是连接下梅尔斯托克和东边五英里外的莫尔福德的大路。		
Here, without a moment’s warning, and in the midst of a general conversation between her father, sister, and the young man before alluded to, who devotedly wooed her in ignorance of her infatuation, she would start from her seat in the chimney-corner as if she had received a galvanic shock, and spring convulsively towards the ceiling; then she would burst into tears, and it was not till some half-hour had passed that she grew calm as usual.	在这房子里，当父亲、姐姐以及之前提到的年轻男子——他热烈地追求她，却并不知道她的悸动——进行日常的交谈时，她会毫无预警地从壁炉边的座位上跳起来，再向天花板猛跳几下，好像触了电一般。接着她便大哭起来，持续半个小时左右才会恢复平静。		
Her father, knowing her hysterical tendencies, was always excessively anxious about this trait in his youngest girl, and feared the attack to be a species of epileptic fit.	她的父亲知道她情绪很容易变得激动，总是为最小的女儿这一特质忧心忡忡，担心那是癫痫发作的症状。		
Not so her sister Julia.	她的姐姐朱莉娅可不这么想。		
Julia had found out what was the cause.	朱莉娅已经发现了原因。		
At the moment before the jumping, only an exceptionally sensitive ear situated in the chimney-nook could have caught from down the flue the beat of a man’s footstep along the highway without.	在她跳跃之前，只有坐在壁炉边上且耳朵极度灵敏的人，才可以听到从烟囱管道传来的公路上一个男人的脚步声。		
But it was in that footfall, for which she had been waiting, that the origin of Car’line’s involuntary springing lay.	那是卡罗琳一直等待的脚步声，正是那脚步声使得卡罗琳不由自主地跳跃。		
The pedestrian was Mop Ollamoor, as the girl well knew; but his business that way was not to visit her; he sought another woman whom he spoke of as his Intended, and who lived at Moreford, two miles farther on.	那个行人就是“大拖把”奥拉莫尔，这一点女孩很清楚。但是，他到这里并不是来拜访她，而是去找那个他称之为意中人的另一个女人。那女人住在莫尔福德，还要再走两英里才到。		
On one, and only one, occasion did it happen that Car’line could not control her utterance; it was when her sister alone chanced to be present.	有一次，只有一次，卡罗琳情不自禁地叫出声来，那一次恰好只有她姐姐在场。		
‘Oh—oh—oh—!’ she cried.	“哦——哦——哦——！”她叫道，		
‘He’s going to her, and not coming to me!’	“他是去找她，不是来找我！”		
To do the fiddler justice he had not at first thought greatly of, or spoken much to, this girl of impressionable mould.	说句公道话，刚开始，这位小提琴手对这位多愁善感的姑娘并不很感兴趣，也没和她说过几句话。		
But he had soon found out her secret, and could not resist a little by-play with her too easily hurt heart, as an interlude between his more serious performances at Moreford.	但是，他很快就发现了她的秘密，便忍不住玩弄一下她那太过容易受伤的心，作为他在莫尔福德正经恋情的小插曲。		
The two became well acquainted, though only by stealth, hardly a soul in Stickleford except her sister, and her lover Ned Hipcroft, being aware of the attachment.	两个人变得熟稔起来，不过只是在暗地里。在斯蒂克福德，只有她姐姐和她的恋人内德·希普克罗夫特知道两人有来往。		
Her father disapproved of her coldness to Ned; her sister, too, hoped she might get over this nervous passion for a man of whom so little was known.	她父亲不赞成她对内德如此冷淡，她姐姐也希望她能摆脱对一个不怎么了解的男人的那神经质的激情。		
The ultimate result was that Car’line’s manly and simple wooer Edward found his suit becoming practically hopeless.	最终的结果是，爱德华——卡罗琳那单纯质朴、具有男子气概的追求者发现他的求爱几乎无望。		
He was a respectable mechanic, in a far sounder position than Mop the nominal horse-doctor; but when, before leaving her, Ned put his flat and final question, would she marry him, then and there, now or never, it was with little expectation of obtaining more than the negative she gave him.	他是个受人尊敬的机械师，地位远高于“大拖把”这个名义上的兽医。但是，在离开她之前，内德直截了当地最后一次问她愿不愿意嫁给他，要么当场答应，要么断绝关系。不出所料，她给出了否定的答案。		
Though her father supported him and her sister supported him, he could not play the fiddle so as to draw your soul out of your body like a spider’s thread, as Mop did, till you felt as limp as withy-wind and yearned for something to cling to.	尽管她父亲支持他，她姐姐也支持他，但是他却不能像“大拖把”那样拉小提琴，把你的灵魂如蜘蛛抽丝般从身体抽离出来，直到你觉得自己像风中的柳条般柔软无力，渴望依附着什么。		
Indeed, Hipcroft had not the slightest ear for music; could not sing two notes in tune, much less play them.	实际上，希普克罗夫特一点儿音乐天赋都没有，两个音符都唱不到调上，更别说演奏了。		
The No he had expected and got from her, in spite of a preliminary encouragement, gave Ned a new start in life.	尽管她最初对他有过鼓励，但她的拒绝也在他预料之中。这使内德的生活有了一个新开端。		
It had been uttered in such a tone of sad entreaty that he resolved to persecute her no more; she should not even be distressed by a sight of his form in the distant perspective of the street and lane.	卡罗琳拒绝他时，语气哀婉，带着恳求，于是他决定不再纠缠她。她甚至都不应该因在街头巷尾看到他的身影而感到不安。		
He left the place, and his natural course was to London.	他离开了，目的地自然是伦敦。		
The railway to South Wessex was in process of construction, but it was not as yet opened for traffic; and Hipcroft reached the capital by a six days’ trudge on foot, as many a better man had done before him.	那时，通往南威塞克斯的铁路还在建设，没有开通运行。像许多优秀的前人一样，希普克罗夫特经过六天的步行跋涉才来到首都。		
He was one of the last of the artisan class who used that now extinct method of travel to the great centres of labour, so customary then from time immemorial.	自古以来，步行是惯用的交通方式，但现在已经不流行了，而他则是最后一批用这种方式来到巨大的劳动力中心的工匠之一。		
In London he lived and worked regularly at his trade.	他在伦敦的生活、工作都很有规律。		
More fortunate than many, his disinterested willingness recommended him from the first.	比很多人都幸运的是，他大公无私，任劳任怨，这使他初来就受到青睐。		
During the ensuing four years he was never out of employment.	在之后的四年里，他从未失过业。		
He neither advanced nor receded in the modern sense; he improved as a workman, but he did not shift one jot in social position.	从现代的角度看，他既没有进步，也没有退步。作为一个工人，他技艺有所提高，但他的社会地位并没有丝毫改变。		
About his love for Car’line he maintained a rigid silence.	至于他对卡罗琳的爱，他守口如瓶。		
No doubt he often thought of her; but being always occupied, and having no relations at Stickleford, he held no communication with that part of the country, and showed no desire to return.	毫无疑问，他经常想起她，但是因为总有活干，在斯蒂克福德也没什么亲戚，他与那里没有什么联系，也没有表现出想回去的欲望。		
In his quiet lodging in Lambeth he moved about after working-hours with the facility of a woman, doing his own cooking, attending to his stocking-heels, and shaping himself by degrees to a life-long bachelorhood.	他在兰贝斯过着安静的生活。下班后，他像个女人一样熟练地忙碌，自己做饭、缝补袜子的脚后跟，把自己锻炼成一个可以单身过一辈子的男人。		
For this conduct one is bound to advance the canonical reason that time could not efface from his heart the image of little Car’line Aspent—and it may be in part true; but there was also the inference that his was a nature not greatly dependent upon the ministrations of the other sex for its comforts.	对于这种行为，人们很可能会提出那种经典的解释，即时间并不能把小卡罗琳·阿斯彭特的身影从他心中抹去——这可能在一定程度上是对的；但是还有人推断说，他本质上并不是一个需要女人的服侍照料才能使自己舒服的人。		
The fourth year of his residence as a mechanic in London was the year of the Hyde-Park Exhibition already mentioned, and at the construction of this huge glass-house, then unexampled in the world’s history, he worked daily.	他作为机械师在伦敦居住的第四年，就是之前提到的在海德公园举办万国工业博览会的那一年。为了建造当时世界上史无前例的那座巨大玻璃建筑，他每天都工作。		
It was an era of great hope and activity among the nations and industries.	那是一个兴旺繁忙、前景美好的时代，各个国家、各种行业都是如此。		
Though Hipcroft was, in his small way, a central man in the movement, he plodded on with his usual outward placidity.	尽管从希普克罗夫特本人来看，他处于这场运动的中心，但他还是埋头苦干，外表一如既往地平静。		
Yet for him, too, the year was destined to have its surprises, for when the bustle of getting the building ready for the opening day was past, the ceremonies had been witnessed, and people were flocking thither from all parts of the globe, he received a letter from Car’line.	然而，对他来说，那一年同样注定会有意想不到的地方。因为当开幕式的准备工作忙完，仪式举行后，人们从世界各地蜂拥而至时，他收到了卡罗琳的一封信。		
Till that day the silence of four years between himself and Stickleford had never been broken.	直到那一天，他与斯蒂克福德之间四年的沉默才被打破。		
She informed her old lover, in an uncertain penmanship which suggested a trembling hand, of the trouble she had been put to in ascertaining his address, and then broached the subject which had prompted her to write.	信中的字歪歪扭扭，可以看出写信时她的手是颤抖的。她告诉这位昔日的情人，她为了查找他的地址费了多少力，然后提到了促使她写信的主题。		
Four years ago, she said with the greatest delicacy of which she was capable, she had been so foolish as to refuse him.	她尽力用最委婉的方式写道，自己四年前拒绝他是非常愚蠢的。		
Her wilful wrong-headedness had since been a grief to her many times, and of late particularly.	从那之后，她的任性、糊涂多次使她悲伤不已，最近尤其严重。		
As for Mr. Ollamoor, he had been absent almost as long as Ned—she did not know where.	至于奥拉莫尔先生，他也离开了，离开的时间和内德差不多长——她不知道他去了哪里。		
She would gladly marry Ned now if he were to ask her again, and be a tender little wife to him till her life’s end.	如果内德再次求婚的话，她会很乐意嫁给他，做他温柔的小妻子，直到生命结束。		
A tide of warm feeling must have surged through Ned Hipcroft’s frame on receipt of this news, if we may judge by the issue.	如果我们可以就此事来判断的话，内德·希普克罗夫特收到这消息时，身上想必会泛起一股暖流。		
Unquestionably he loved her still, even if not to the exclusion of every other happiness.	毋庸置疑，他仍然爱她，虽然还不至于让他把其他各种幸福置之不顾。		
This from his Car’line, she who had been dead to him these many years, alive to him again as of old, was in itself a pleasant, gratifying thing.	在这么多年的冷漠之后，他的卡罗琳如今又像以前那样对他，这本身就是一件让人开心和满意的事情。		
Ned had grown so resigned to, or satisfied with, his lonely lot, that he probably would not have shown much jubilation at anything.	内德已经习惯于对自己孤独的命运逆来顺受，甚至感到满足，或许不会对任何事情表现出欣喜。		
Still, a certain ardour of preoccupation, after his first surprise, revealed how deeply her confession of faith in him had stirred him.	但是，继最初的惊讶之后，他那独特的专注热情表明了她的告白使他极为激动不安。		
Measured and methodical in his ways, he did not answer the letter that day, nor the next, nor the next.	他习惯再三揣摩、有条不紊，当天并未回信，第二天、第三天也没有。		
He was having ‘a good think.’	他在“认真思考”。		
When he did answer it, there was a great deal of sound reasoning mixed in with the unmistakable tenderness of his reply; but the tenderness itself was sufficient to reveal that he was pleased with her straightforward frankness; that the anchorage she had once obtained in his heart was renewable, if it had not been continuously firm.	当他回信时，信中既有大量合理的说理，还有着显而易见的柔情，但那柔情本身就足以证明他喜欢她的直率坦白。她在他心中的位置虽然不是一直那样稳固，但也可以再次恢复。		
He told her—and as he wrote his lips twitched humorously over the few gentle words of raillery he indited among the rest of his sentences—that it was all very well for her to come round at this time of day.	他告诉她——他在句子中写了一些温和的玩笑话，自以为很幽默，嘴唇抽动着笑起来——时至今日，她能回心转意自然很好。		
Why wouldn’t she have him when he wanted her?	可为什么当他向她求爱时，她却拒绝了他呢？		
She had no doubt learned that he was not married, but suppose his affections had since been fixed on another?	毫无疑问，她打听到他尚未结婚，但是假设那之后他喜欢上了别人呢？		
She ought to beg his pardon.	她应该乞求他的原谅。		
Still, he was not the man to forget her.	然而，他还是忘不了她。		
But considering how he had been used, and what he had suffered, she could not quite expect him to go down to Stickleford and fetch her.	但是，考虑到他之前受过的冷遇以及遭受的折磨，她也不能过于期待他会回斯蒂克福德来接她。		
But if she would come to him, and say she was sorry, as was only fair; why, yes, he would marry her, knowing what a good little woman she was at the core.	但是，如果她肯来找他，向他道歉——只有这样才是公平的做法——他还是会娶她，因为他知道她本质上是个多么好的小女人。		
He added that the request for her to come to him was a less one to make than it would have been when he first left Stickleford, or even a few months ago; for the new railway into South Wessex was now open, and there had just begun to be run wonderfully contrived special trains, called excursion-trains, on account of the Great Exhibition; so that she could come up easily alone.	他还补充说，比起他刚离开斯蒂克福德时，甚至比几个月前，要她来找他的这一要求都要更容易满足，因为通往南威塞克斯的新铁路现在开通了。为万国工业博览会之便，一种叫做游览列车的设计精美的专列刚开始运营，这样她可以很轻松地独自过来。		
She said in her reply how good it was of him to treat her so generously, after her hot and cold treatment of him; that though she felt frightened at the magnitude of the journey, and was never as yet in a railway-train, having only seen one pass at a distance, she embraced his offer with all her heart; and would, indeed, own to him how sorry she was, and beg his pardon, and try to be a good wife always, and make up for lost time.	她在回信中说，在她对他忽冷忽热之后，他对她还如此宽容，他真是太好了。她还说，尽管害怕远途旅行且从未坐过火车，只是远远地看过一次火车经过，自己还是心甘情愿地接受他的提议。实际上，她对他心怀歉意，希望能得到他的原谅，她想用余生尽力做个好妻子，弥补过去错失的时光。		
The remaining details of when and where were soon settled, Car’line informing him, for her ready identification in the crowd, that she would be wearing ‘my new sprigged-laylock cotton gown,’ and Ned gaily responding that, having married her the morning after her arrival, he would make a day of it by taking her to the Exhibition.	时间、地点等剩余的细节很快就确定了下来。卡罗琳告诉他，为方便他在人群中找到她，她会穿“带有丁香枝叶图案的新棉布长裙”。内德欢快地回复说，她到来后的第二天早晨，他就跟她结婚，然后会带她去博览会，好好玩一天。		
One early summer afternoon, accordingly, he came from his place of work, and hastened towards Waterloo Station to meet her.	于是，初夏的一天下午，他从工作的地方出发，匆匆赶到滑铁卢火车站去接她。		
It was as wet and chilly as an English June day can occasionally be, but as he waited on the platform in the drizzle he glowed inwardly, and seemed to have something to live for again.	那天下着雨，阴冷潮湿。在英国，六月份偶尔会有这样的坏天气。但是，他冒着细雨在站台上等待的时候，心里是喜悦的，好像生活又有了意义。		
The ‘excursion-train’—an absolutely new departure in the history of travel—was still a novelty on the Wessex line, and probably everywhere.	“游览列车”——旅行史上绝对的新起点——在威塞克斯线上仍然是一种新鲜事物，或许在别的任何地方也都如此。		
Crowds of people had flocked to all the stations on the way up to witness the unwonted sight of so long a train’s passage, even where they did not take advantage of the opportunity it offered.	人群大量涌到沿线所有车站，即便他们并不是想要利用火车之便，也想要目睹那么长的列车经过这一不同寻常的景象。		
The seats for the humbler class of travellers in these early experiments in steam-locomotion, were open trucks, without any protection whatever from the wind and rain; and damp weather having set in with the afternoon, the unfortunate occupants of these vehicles were, on the train drawing up at the London terminus, found to be in a pitiable condition from their long journey; blue-faced, stiff-necked, sneezing, rain-beaten, chilled to the marrow, many of the men being hatless; in fact, they resembled people who had been out all night in an open boat on a rough sea, rather than inland excursionists for pleasure.	蒸汽机车刚开始试运营，下层旅客乘坐的是敞开式车厢，没有任何遮风避雨的东西。下午一直在下雨，当火车驶进伦敦终点站时，乘坐这些车厢的不幸的人们在漫长的旅程之后处于一种狼狈的状态：脸色青紫、脖子僵硬、喷嚏连连、浑身湿透、全身冰冷。很多男人连帽子都没戴。实际上，他们更像是在汹涌海面上的敞篷船上呆了一晚上，不像是在内陆游览取乐了。		
The women had in some degree protected themselves by turning up the skirts of their gowns over their heads, but as by this arrangement they were additionally exposed about the hips, they were all more or less in a sorry plight.	女人们把长裙的裙摆向上翻卷，蒙住头，用这样的方式遮蔽风雨。不过，这样她们的屁股却没了防护，所以她们也差不多一样狼狈不堪。		
In the bustle and crush of alighting forms of both sexes which followed the entry of the huge concatenation into the station, Ned Hipcroft soon discerned the slim little figure his eye was in search of, in the sprigged lilac, as described.	那一长串列车进站后，男男女女喧闹着挤下车来。内德·希普克罗夫特很快就在人群中发现了一直在寻找的那个苗条娇小的身影。正如信中描述的那样，她穿着丁香枝叶图案的衣服。		
She came up to him with a frightened smile—still pretty, though so damp, weather-beaten, and shivering from long exposure to the wind.	她走向他，微笑里带着恐惧——尽管一路风吹雨淋，她浑身湿透，冻得瑟瑟发抖，却依然漂亮。		
‘O Ned!’ she sputtered, ‘I—I—’ He clasped her in his arms and kissed her, whereupon she burst into a flood of tears.	“哦，内德！”她结结巴巴地说，“我——我——”他双臂紧紧抱住她，亲吻她，这时她大哭起来。		
‘You are wet, my poor dear!	“你湿透了，可怜的宝贝！		
I hope you’ll not get cold,’ he said.	希望你不会感冒。”他说。		
And surveying her and her multifarious surrounding packages, he noticed that by the hand she led a toddling child—a little girl of three or so—whose hood was as clammy and tender face as blue as those of the other travellers.	审视了她以及她周围各种行李之后，他看到她的手牵着一个蹒跚学步的孩子——三岁左右的小女孩——像其他旅行者一样，她的兜帽湿乎乎的，柔嫩的脸蛋冻得发紫。		
‘Who is this—somebody you know?’ asked Ned curiously.	“这是谁——你认识的人？”内德好奇地问。		
‘Yes, Ned.	“是的，内德。		
She’s mine.’	她是我的。”		
‘Yours?’	“你的？”		
‘Yes—my own!’	“是——我自己的孩子！”		
‘Your own child?’	“你自己的孩子？”		
‘Yes!’	“对！”		
‘Well—as God’s in—’	“哦——天哪——”		
‘Ned, I didn’t name it in my letter, because, you see, it would have been so hard to explain!	“内德，我在信中没有跟你说，因为你知道，这太难解释了！		
I thought that when we met I could tell you how she happened to be born, so much better than in writing!	我觉得我们见面时再告诉你怎样碰巧生下了她，比在信中说要好得多！		
I hope you’ll excuse it this once, dear Ned, and not scold me, now I’ve come so many, many miles!’	我希望你能原谅我这一次，亲爱的内德，我已经从那么远的地方来了，就不要责备我了！”		
‘This means Mr. Mop Ollamoor, I reckon!’ said Hipcroft, gazing palely at them from the distance of the yard or two to which he had withdrawn with a start.	“我想这就是‘大拖把’奥拉莫尔先生的孩子吧！”希普克罗夫特边说，边吃惊地后退了一两码，脸色苍白地凝视着她们。		
Car’line gasped.	卡罗琳喘了口气。		
‘But he’s been gone away for years!’ she supplicated.	“但是他已经走了好几年了！”她哀求道，		
‘And I never had a young man before!	“我之前从未和一个小伙子好过！		
And I was so unlucky to be catched the first time, though some of the girls down there go on like anything!’	我太倒霉了，第一次就怀孕了，别的女孩子不论怎么样都没事！”		
Ned remained in silence, pondering.	内德继续沉默，仔细考虑着。		
‘You’ll forgive me, dear Ned?’ she added, beginning to sob outright.	“你会原谅我吧，亲爱的内德？”她又说，同时开始抽泣，		
‘I haven’t taken ’ee in after all, because—because you can pack us back again, if you want to; though ’tis hundreds o’ miles, and so wet, and night a-coming on, and I with no money!’	“毕竟，我没有欺骗你，因为——因为如果你想的话，你可以打发我们回去。不过，要赶好几百英里的路，还下着雨，又快晚上了，而且我也没有钱！”		
‘What the devil can I do!’	“我能怎么做呢！”		
 Hipcroft groaned.	希普克罗夫特痛苦地说。		
A more pitiable picture than the pair of helpless creatures presented was never seen on a rainy day, as they stood on the great, gaunt, puddled platform, a whiff of drizzle blowing under the roof upon them now and then; the pretty attire in which they had started from Stickleford in the early morning bemuddled and sodden, weariness on their faces, and fear of him in their eyes; for the child began to look as if she thought she too had done some wrong, remaining in an appalled silence till the tears rolled down her chubby cheeks.	雨天中再没有比这更加让人怜悯的景象了。这一对孤苦无助的母女站在那凄凉的、满是泥浆的大站台上，时不时有一阵细雨吹到顶棚下，吹到她们身上。她们早晨从斯蒂克福德出发时的漂亮衣服现在沾满泥巴，又湿又皱。她们脸上带着倦容，眼神中还流露出对他的恐惧。那孩子看来开始认为自己也做错了什么，吓得默不作声，直到眼泪滚下她胖嘟嘟的脸颊，才打破这沉默。		
‘What’s the matter, my little maid?’ said Ned mechanically.	“怎么了，小宝贝？”内德机械地说。		
‘I do want to go home!’ she let out, in tones that told of a bursting heart.	“我想回家！”她脱口而出，语调中带着渴求，		
‘And my totties be cold, an’ I shan’t have no bread an’ butter no more!’	“我的脚丫很冷，我也没有黄油面包吃！”		
‘I don’t know what to say to it all!’ declared Ned, his own eye moist as he turned and walked a few steps with his head down; then regarded them again point blank.	“我不知道该说什么了！”内德大声说。他转过身，低着头走了几步，自己的眼睛也湿润了，然后又直直地凝视她们。		
From the child escaped troubled breaths and silently welling tears.	孩子呼吸有些困难，默默地流着泪。		
‘Want some bread and butter, do ’ee?’ he said, with factitious hardness.	“你想吃些黄油面包，对吗？”他故意用硬邦邦的口吻说。		
‘Ye-e-s!’	“嗯！”		
‘Well, I daresay I can get ’ee a bit!	“好，我想我可以给你弄点儿来！		
Naturally, you must want some.	自然，你一定想吃了。		
And you, too, for that matter, Car’line.’	说到这儿，卡罗琳，你也一定想来些。”		
‘I do feel a little hungered.	“我确实觉得有点儿饿了。		
But I can keep it off,’ she murmured.	但是我可以忍着。”她低声说。		
‘Folk shouldn’t do that,’ he said gruffly....	“人可不能挨饿。”他粗声说……		
‘There come along!’ he caught up the child, as he added, ‘You must bide here to-night, anyhow, I s’pose!	“好了，跟我走吧！”他边抱起孩子，边说，“我觉得，无论如何，你们今晚必须住在这儿！		
What can you do otherwise?	不然你们还能怎么办呢？		
I’ll get ’ee some tea and victuals; and as for this job, I’m sure I don’t know what to say!	我会给你们弄点儿茶，弄点儿吃的。至于这件事情，我真不知道说什么才好！		
This is the way out.’	出口在这边。”		
They pursued their way, without speaking, to Ned’s lodgings, which were not far off.	他们朝内德的寓所走去，一路上谁都不说话。房子离得不远。		
There he dried them and made them comfortable, and prepared tea; they thankfully sat down.	回到家，他把她们擦干，让她们舒服些，就去准备茶。她们感激地坐下来。		
The ready-made household of which he suddenly found himself the head imparted a cosy aspect to his room, and a paternal one to himself.	内德突然发现，自己成了这个现成家庭的一家之主。这个家使他的房子变得温馨，也使他觉得自己像个父亲了。		
Presently he turned to the child and kissed her now blooming cheeks; and, looking wistfully at Car’line, kissed her also.	过了一会儿，他转向孩子，亲吻她红润的脸颊；然后，他用依恋的眼神看着卡罗琳，也吻了她。		
‘I don’t see how I can send ’ee back all them miles,’ he growled, ‘now you’ve come all the way o’ purpose to join me.	“既然你们大老远地跑来投奔我，”他低吼道，“这么远的路，我怎么能把你们送回去呢。		
But you must trust me, Car’line, and show you’ve real faith in me.	但是你必须信任我，卡罗琳，并且表现出你确实对我有信心。		
Well, do you feel better now, my little woman?’	哦，你现在感觉好点儿了么，小宝贝？”		
The child nodded, her mouth being otherwise occupied.	孩子点点头，没有说话，因为嘴里吃着东西。		
‘I did trust you, Ned, in coming; and I shall always!’	“我确实信任你，内德，不然怎么会来呢，我会一直信任你！”		
Thus, without any definite agreement to forgive her, he tacitly acquiesced in the fate that Heaven had sent him; and on the day of their marriage (which was not quite so soon as he had expected it could be, on account of the time necessary for banns) he took her to the Exhibition when they came back from church, as he had promised.	这样，他虽没有明确地说原谅她，还是默默接受了上天给他的命运。他们结婚的那天（因为要有足够的结婚公告时间，所以并不像他想象得那样早），从教堂回来后，他带她去了博览会，正如他许诺的那样。		
While standing near a large mirror in one of the courts devoted to furniture, Car’line started, for in the glass appeared the reflection of a form exactly resembling Mop Ollamoor’s—so exactly, that it seemed impossible to believe anybody but that artist in person to be the original.	在一个家具展览场地，卡罗琳站在一面大镜子前，突然吃了一惊，因为镜子中出现了一个像极了“大拖把”奥拉莫尔的人影——简直一模一样，似乎就是那位艺术家本人，不可能是其他人。		
On passing round the objects which hemmed in Ned, her, and the child from a direct view, no Mop was to be seen.	附近的家具阻碍了他们一家三口，让他们无法直接看到那个人。等绕过去之后，她并没有看到大拖把。		
Whether he were really in London or not at that time was never known; and Car’line always stoutly denied that her readiness to go and meet Ned in town arose from any rumour that Mop had also gone thither; which denial there was no reasonable ground for doubting.	至于那时他是否真的在伦敦，永远无从知晓了。卡罗琳总是坚决否认，说她愿意来伦敦找内德，并不是因为有传言说“大拖把”也到了伦敦。没有任何合理的依据来怀疑她的这种否认。		
And then the year glided away, and the Exhibition folded itself up and became a thing of the past.	然后，这一年不知不觉地就过去了。展览会结束了，成为了过去。		
The park trees that had been enclosed for six months were again exposed to the winds and storms, and the sod grew green anew.	公园中被遮蔽了六个月的树木又暴露在风雨中，草地也重新变绿。		
Ned found that Car’line resolved herself into a very good wife and companion, though she had made herself what is called cheap to him; but in that she was like another domestic article, a cheap tea-pot, which often brews better tea than a dear one.	内德发现卡罗琳变成了一个很好的妻子、伴侣，尽管她的过去让他觉得她有些“低贱”。但是，在这一点上，她就像另一件家居物品，虽然是一把廉价的茶壶，但是与昂贵的茶壶相比，却能冲出更好的茶。		
One autumn Hipcroft found himself with but little work to do, and a prospect of less for the winter.	一年秋天，希普克罗夫特发现自己几乎没什么活干，冬天活可能会更少。		
Both being country born and bred, they fancied they would like to live again in their natural atmosphere.	他们都是在乡村出生成长，因而觉得重新回到自然的环境中生活也不错。		
It was accordingly decided between them that they should leave the pent-up London lodging, and that Ned should seek out employment near his native place, his wife and her daughter staying with Car’line’s father during the search for occupation and an abode of their own.	于是，他们决定离开伦敦那压抑的寓所。内德会在家乡附近找份工作，在他找工作和寓所时，妻子、孩子同卡罗琳的父亲一起生活。		
Tinglings of pleasure pervaded Car’line’s spasmodic little frame as she journeyed down with Ned to the place she had left two or three years before, in silence and under a cloud.	两三年前卡罗琳离开时，她默默无言，抑郁不欢，而现在她同内德回到家乡，激动、愉悦一阵阵地刺激着她娇小的身体。		
To return to where she had once been despised, a smiling London wife with a distinct London accent, was a triumph which the world did not witness every day.	作为一个伦敦妻子，说着地道的伦敦音，笑吟吟地回到曾经被看不起的地方，也算一种胜利。世上并非每天都能发生这种事。		
The train did not stop at the petty roadside station that lay nearest to Stickleford, and the trio went on to Casterbridge.	火车没有在离斯蒂克福德最近的路边小站停靠，三个人在卡斯特桥下车。		
Ned thought it a good opportunity to make a few preliminary inquiries for employment at workshops in the borough where he had been known; and feeling cold from her journey, and it being dry underfoot and only dusk as yet, with a moon on the point of rising, Car’line and her little girl walked on toward Stickleford, leaving Ned to follow at a quicker pace, and pick her up at a certain half-way house, widely known as an inn.	内德想，镇上有人认识他，他正好可以趁这个机会去那里的作坊谋个工作。卡罗琳觉得坐了一路的车，身上很冷，加上路上干燥，天还没黑，月亮又快升起，便带着女儿继续朝斯蒂克福德走去。之后内德可以快步追上她们，在半路上的一间广为人知的旅馆接她。		
The woman and child pursued the well-remembered way comfortably enough, though they were both becoming wearied.	母女俩沿着熟悉的道路走得还算轻松，虽然两个人都有些疲倦。		
In the course of three miles they had passed Heedless-William’s Pond, the familiar landmark by Bloom’s End, and were drawing near the Quiet Woman Inn, a lone roadside hostel on the lower verge of the Egdon Heath, since and for many years abolished.	在三英里的路途中，她们经过了粗心的威廉的池塘——一个熟悉的布鲁姆端地标，然后向“静佳人”旅馆走去。那是埃格顿荒原边缘一所孤零零的路边旅店。此后，这旅店废弃了很多年。		
In stepping up towards it Car’line heard more voices within than had formerly been customary at such an hour, and she learned that an auction of fat stock had been held near the spot that afternoon.	离旅店越来越近，卡罗琳听到里面很热闹，而以往的这个时间里面总是很安静。她打听到下午这附近举办了一场食用家畜拍卖会。		
The child would be the better for a rest as well as herself, she thought, and she entered.	她和孩子最好都休息一下，她想，于是她就进去了。		
The guests and customers overflowed into the passage, and Car’line had no sooner crossed the threshold than a man whom she remembered by sight came forward with glass and mug in his hands towards a friend leaning against the wall; but, seeing her, very gallantly offered her a drink of the liquor, which was gin-and-beer hot, pouring her out a tumblerful and saying, in a moment or two: ‘Surely, ’tis little Car’line Aspent that was—down at Stickleford?’	客人和买家畜的人很多，都挤到过道里来了。卡罗琳刚跨过门槛，就看到一个眼熟的人，正端着玻璃杯和马克杯走向一个倚在墙上的朋友。但是，一看到她，那人就很殷勤地为她点了一杯现配的杜松子酒和啤酒的混合酒。他给她倒了一杯，过了一会儿说：“可不，这不是斯蒂克福德的小卡罗琳·阿斯彭特吗？”		
She assented, and, though she did not exactly want this beverage, she drank it since it was offered, and her entertainer begged her to come in farther and sit down.	她承认了。尽管她不想喝这杯酒，但既然有人请了，她还是喝了，然后请她喝酒的人又请她进里面坐下。		
Once within the room she found that all the persons present were seated close against the walls, and there being a chair vacant she did the same.	一进入房间，她就发现在场所有的人都紧挨着墙坐着。有把椅子空着，她便也靠墙坐下。		
An explanation of their position occurred the next moment.	他们这样坐的原因很快就清楚了。		
In the opposite corner stood Mop, rosining his bow and looking just the same as ever.	对面的角落里站着“大拖把”，他正用松香擦着琴弓，看起来和以前一样。		
The company had cleared the middle of the room for dancing, and they were about to dance again.	大家把房间的中间清空是为了跳舞，他们马上又要开始跳了。		
As she wore a veil to keep off the wind she did not think he had recognized her, or could possibly guess the identity of the child; and to her satisfied surprise she found that she could confront him quite calmly—mistress of herself in the dignity her London life had given her.	她带着防风的面纱，所以觉得他不会认出自己，也不会猜出孩子的身份。让她既惊讶又满意的是，她可以平静地面对他——伦敦的生活给了她尊严，让她可以庄重自持。		
Before she had quite emptied her glass the dance was called, the dancers formed in two lines, the music sounded, and the figure began.	她还没喝完那杯酒，舞会就开始了。跳舞的人站成两排，音乐响起，人们开始跳舞。		
Then matters changed for Car’line.	然后，对卡罗琳来说，事情改变了。		
A tremor quickened itself to life in her, and her hand so shook that she could hardly set down her glass.	她体内重新升起了一股冲动的感觉，手剧烈地颤抖着，几乎放不下手里的酒杯。		
It was not the dance nor the dancers, but the notes of that old violin which thrilled the London wife, these having still all the witchery that she had so well known of yore, and under which she had used to lose her power of independent will.	使这位伦敦妻子震颤的，既不是舞蹈也不是舞者，而是那把旧小提琴拉出的音符。那音符仍旧有着昔日她熟知的魔力，她曾经在那魔力下不能自已。		
How it all came back!	那种感觉怎么又来了！		
There was the fiddling figure against the wall; the large, oily, mop-like head of him, and beneath the mop the face with closed eyes.	拉小提琴的人倚着墙，他的大脑袋油腻腻的，好似大拖把，大拖把下面是闭着眼睛的面孔。		
After the first moments of paralyzed reverie the familiar tune in the familiar rendering made her laugh and shed tears simultaneously.	开始有一段时间，她陷入幻想，无力自拔，继而那熟悉的曲调、熟悉的演奏方式，让她又哭又笑。		
Then a man at the bottom of the dance, whose partner had dropped away, stretched out his hand and beckoned to her to take the place.	这时，舞队末尾有名男子的舞伴退下来了，于是那男子伸出手，示意她来接替。		
She did not want to dance; she entreated by signs to be left where she was, but she was entreating of the tune and its player rather than of the dancing man.	她不想跳，便打了手势，恳求继续呆在原来的位置。但是，与其说是恳求邀舞的人，不如说是恳求那曲调和曲调的演奏者。		
The saltatory tendency which the fiddler and his cunning instrument had ever been able to start in her was seizing Car’line just as it had done in earlier years, possibly assisted by the gin-and-beer hot.	前些年，小提琴手及其狡诈的乐器总让她有翩然起舞的欲望，现在，这欲望又攫住了她。那杯现配的混合酒，可能也加剧了这种欲望。		
Tired as she was she grasped her little girl by the hand, and plunging in at the bottom of the figure, whirled about with the rest.	尽管她很疲惫，她还是抓起女儿的手，冲进队尾，和其他人一起旋转跳舞。		
She found that her companions were mostly people of the neighbouring hamlets and farms—Bloom’s End, Mellstock, Lewgate, and elsewhere; and by degrees she was recognized as she convulsively danced on, wishing that Mop would cease and let her heart rest from the aching he caused, and her feet also.	她发现舞伴们多是来自附近的村庄或农场——布鲁姆端、梅尔斯托克、刘盖特等地方。渐渐地，随着她越跳越兴奋，人们认出了她。她希望“大拖把”能够停下来，让她那因他而痛的心和双脚得以休息。		
After long and many minutes the dance ended, when she was urged to fortify herself with more gin-and-beer; which she did, feeling very weak and overpowered with hysteric emotion.	很长一段时间之后，舞才停下来。有人让她再喝些杜松子和啤酒的混合酒提提神。她感觉浑身虚弱无力，无法忍受那亢奋的情绪，便喝了酒。		
She refrained from unveiling, to keep Mop in ignorance of her presence, if possible.	她强忍着不解下面纱，尽可能不让“大拖把”认出她。		
Several of the guests having left, Car’line hastily wiped her lips and also turned to go; but, according to the account of some who remained, at that very moment a five-handed reel was proposed, in which two or three begged her to join.	几个客人走了，卡罗琳匆匆擦了擦嘴，也想转身离开。然而，据留下来的人说，那时恰好有人提议跳五人里尔舞，两三个人邀请她加入。		
She declined on the plea of being tired and having to walk to Stickleford, when Mop began aggressively tweedling ‘My Fancy-Lad,’ in D major, as the air to which the reel was to be footed.	她以疲惫不堪、还要走回斯蒂克福德为由拒绝了。这时，“大拖把”咄咄逼人，开始用D大调拉起了《我的情郎》，作为这支里尔舞的伴奏曲。		
He must have recognized her, though she did not know it, for it was the strain of all seductive strains which she was least able to resist—the one he had played when she was leaning over the bridge at the date of their first acquaintance.	他肯定认出了她，但她还不知道，因为那是所有魅惑人心的曲子中她最难以抗拒的——他们初识那天，她倚着桥栏时，他拉的就是那一支。		
Car’line stepped despairingly into the middle of the room with the other four.	卡罗琳绝望地和其他四人一起走到屋子中间。		
Reels were resorted to hereabouts at this time by the more robust spirits, for the reduction of superfluous energy which the ordinary figure-dances were not powerful enough to exhaust.	当时，这一带身强体壮的人才会跳里尔舞，其他舞不够剧烈，只有里尔舞才能消耗过剩的精力。		
As everybody knows, or does not know, the five reelers stood in the form of a cross, the reel being performed by each line of three alternately, the persons who successively came to the middle place dancing in both directions.	众所周知，或许也不是人人皆知，五名里尔舞者站成十字，三人一行，两行轮换着跳，相继跳到中间位置的人两个方向都跳。		
Car’line soon found herself in this place, the axis of the whole performance, and could not get out of it, the tune turning into the first part without giving her opportunity.	卡罗琳很快发现自己就处于这个位置，即整个舞蹈的轴心；而且她换不了位置，正巧曲子转入第一部分，让她没有机会脱身。		
And now she began to suspect that Mop did know her, and was doing this on purpose, though whenever she stole a glance at him his closed eyes betokened obliviousness to everything outside his own brain.	此时，她开始怀疑“大拖把”认出了她，才故意为之，尽管每次她偷瞥他，他都闭着眼睛，好像除了脑子里的乐曲，其他都浑然不觉。		
She continued to wend her way through the figure of 8 that was formed by her course, the fiddler introducing into his notes the wild and agonizing sweetness of a living voice in one too highly wrought; its pathos running high and running low in endless variation, projecting through her nerves excruciating spasms, a sort of blissful torture.	她的舞步形成一个8字，她沿着这个8字一直跳。小提琴手在曲调中加入狂野而又令人心痛的动听旋律，好似过度兴奋的人在吟唱一般。曲调悲怆，时高时低，不断变化，刺激着她的神经，引起阵阵痛苦，让她既欣喜若狂又痛苦不堪。		
The room swam, the tune was endless; and in about a quarter of an hour the only other woman in the figure dropped out exhausted, and sank panting on a bench.	房间在旋转，曲子无休无尽。过了约摸一刻钟，舞蹈中唯一的另一个女性退了下来，精疲力竭、气喘吁吁地瘫在长凳上。		
The reel instantly resolved itself into a four-handed one.	五人里尔舞立刻变成了四人舞。		
Car’line would have given anything to leave off; but she had, or fancied she had, no power, while Mop played such tunes; and thus another ten minutes slipped by, a haze of dust now clouding the candles, the floor being of stone, sanded.	卡罗琳只想停下来，并愿意为此付出任何代价。然而，“大拖把”拉这样的曲子时，她没有，或者她自认没有力量能做到这一点。这样不知不觉间又过了十分钟，石砌的地板浮起尘土，扬起的尘雾笼罩住蜡烛，遮暗了烛光。		
Then another dancer fell out—one of the men—and went into the passage, in a frantic search for liquor.	接着又有一个跳舞的人退出——一个男人——他跑到过道，疯狂地找酒喝。		
To turn the figure into a three-handed reel was the work of a second, Mop modulating at the same time into ‘The Fairy Dance,’ as better suited to the contracted movement, and no less one of those foods of love which, as manufactured by his bow, had always intoxicated her.	眨眼间四人舞变成了三人舞，同时，“大拖把”把调子转为《仙女舞》，更好地配合紧凑的动作。而且，这曲子丝毫不逊于他的琴弓曾奏出的情歌，那些曲子曾让她深深沉醉其中。		
In a reel for three there was no rest whatever, and four or five minutes were enough to make her remaining two partners, now thoroughly blown, stamp their last bar and, like their predecessors, limp off into the next room to get something to drink.	跳三人里尔舞根本不能休息，不过四五分钟，剩下的两个舞伴就已上气不接下气，跺着脚跳了最后一节，就跟之前离开的人一样，一瘸一拐地走到隔壁房间找酒喝。		
Car’line, half-stifled inside her veil, was left dancing alone, the apartment now being empty of everybody save herself, Mop, and their little girl.	面纱之下，卡罗琳几乎窒息。现在只剩她一个人跳了，房间里除了她自己、“大拖把”和他们的女儿之外，别无他人。		
She flung up the veil, and cast her eyes upon him, as if imploring him to withdraw himself and his acoustic magnetism from the atmosphere.	她猛地掀起面纱，眼神投向他，好似乞求他离开，乞求他停下那魅惑的声音。		
Mop opened one of his own orbs, as though for the first time, fixed it peeringly upon her, and smiling dreamily, threw into his strains the reserve of expression which he could not afford to waste on a big and noisy dance.	“大拖把”睁开一只眼，好像是第一次张开似的，紧紧盯着她。他带着朦胧的笑意，把保留着的感情倾注在乐曲中，大而喧闹的舞会可不值得他浪费这样的感情。		
Crowds of little chromatic subtleties, capable of drawing tears from a statue, proceeded straightway from the ancient fiddle, as if it were dying of the emotion which had been pent up within it ever since its banishment from some Italian city where it first took shape and sound.	旧提琴立刻奏出足以使石像流泪的大量短促、微妙的半音，似乎自从它在意大利某城成形、试音之后，一直被放逐，现在极度渴望宣泄一直郁积于心的情感。		
There was that in the look of Mop’s one dark eye which said: ‘You cannot leave off, dear, whether you would or no!’ and it bred in her a paroxysm of desperation that defied him to tire her down.	“大拖把”那只黝黑的眼睛仿佛在说：“不管你愿不愿意，亲爱的，你都停不下来！”这神情使她想要铤而走险，看看“大拖把”到底能不能把她累垮。		
She thus continued to dance alone, defiantly as she thought, but in truth slavishly and abjectly, subject to every wave of the melody, and probed by the gimlet-like gaze of her fascinator’s open eye; keeping up at the same time a feeble smile in his face, as a feint to signify it was still her own pleasure which led her on.	就这样，她独自跳了下去。她认为自己是在反抗，实际上，则是顺服、卑微地屈从于旋律的每个波动起伏，任由魅惑者张着的眼睛用钻子般的眼神探查她的内心。与此同时，当着他的面，她脸上还要尽力保持着无力的微笑，好像一种伪装，证明她一直跳下去是因为自己高兴。		
A terrified embarrassment as to what she could say to him if she were to leave off, had its unrecognized share in keeping her going.	如果停下，她不知道要对他说什么，对这种极为尴尬的场面的恐惧也是她继续跳下去的原因之一，不过她并未意识到这一点。		
The child, who was beginning to be distressed by the strange situation, came up and said: ‘Stop, mother, stop, and let’s go home!’ as she seized Car’line’s hand.	这种怪异的气氛开始让孩子感到不安，她走上来，抓住卡罗琳的手说：“停下，妈妈，停下，我们回家！”		
Suddenly Car’line sank staggering to the floor; and rolling over on her face, prone she remained.	突然，卡罗琳摇晃着瘫在地上，然后翻身向下，一直俯卧着。		
Mop’s fiddle thereupon emitted an elfin shriek of finality; stepping quickly down from the nine-gallon beer-cask which had formed his rostrum, he went to the little girl, who disconsolately bent over her mother.	“大拖把”的小提琴随即发出恶作剧般的尖叫声作为收尾。他从那只作为演奏台的九加仑啤酒桶上下来，快步走向俯在母亲身边的悲伤的小女孩。		
The guests who had gone into the back-room for liquor and change of air, hearing something unusual, trooped back hitherward, where they endeavoured to revive poor, weak Car’line by blowing her with the bellows and opening the window.	方才去后面房间喝酒和透气的客人们听到奇怪的声响，于是成群结队地回到了这个房间，他们大喊了好一阵，又打开了窗户，才把可怜的虚弱的卡罗琳唤醒。		
Ned, her husband, who had been detained in Casterbridge, as aforesaid, came along the road at this juncture, and hearing excited voices through the open casement, and to his great surprise, the mention of his wife’s name, he entered amid the rest upon the scene.	如之前所说，她的丈夫内德在卡斯特桥耽搁了，这时正沿着路走来。他从开着的窗子中听到了激动的喊声，令他大吃一惊的是，叫声中提到了他妻子的名字。于是，他拨开众人走了进去。		
Car’line was now in convulsions, weeping violently, and for a long time nothing could be done with her.	此时，卡罗琳浑身抽搐，号啕大哭，很长一段时间都让人束手无策。		
While he was sending for a cart to take her onward to Stickleford Hipcroft anxiously inquired how it had all happened; and then the assembly explained that a fiddler formerly known in the locality had lately revisited his old haunts, and had taken upon himself without invitation to play that evening at the inn.	希普克罗夫特一边让人找辆马车把她送到斯蒂克福德，一边急切地询问发生了什么事。然后大家解释说，本地人熟知的一名小提琴手最近重游故地，那晚上没人邀请便自己在旅馆演奏起来。		
Ned demanded the fiddler’s name, and they said Ollamoor.	内德问起小提琴手的名字，他们说是奥拉莫尔。		
‘Ah!’ exclaimed Ned, looking round him.	“啊！”内德大叫，扫视四周，		
‘Where is he, and where—where’s my little girl?’	“他在哪儿，我的——我的女儿在哪儿？”		
Ollamoor had disappeared, and so had the child.	奥拉莫尔消失了，孩子也不见了。		
Hipcroft was in ordinary a quiet and tractable fellow, but a determination which was to be feared settled in his face now.	平时，希普克罗夫特安静、温顺，但现在脸上却浮现出一种令人恐惧的毅然神情。		
‘Blast him!’ he cried.	“该死的！”他大叫，		
‘I’ll beat his skull in for’n, if I swing for it to-morrow!’	“我要扒了他的皮，就算我明天被绞死也在所不惜！”		
He had rushed to the poker which lay on the hearth, and hastened down the passage, the people following.	他冲到壁炉前，拿起拨火棍就快步跑过过道，人们在后面跟着。		
Outside the house, on the other side of the highway, a mass of dark heath-land rose sullenly upward to its not easily accessible interior, a ravined plateau, whereon jutted into the sky, at the distance of a couple of miles, the fir-woods of Mistover backed by the Yalbury coppices—a place of Dantesque gloom at this hour, which would have afforded secure hiding for a battery of artillery, much less a man and a child.	房子外面，公路的另一边，一大片黑乎乎的石南荒原阴沉地向上隆起，延伸到难以企及的腹地。那是一座布满沟壑的高原，几英里外的远处，密斯托佛的冷杉林直入云霄，后面则是雅伯里灌木丛——这个时间，高原深沉阴暗，一个炮兵连都可安全地藏匿其中，更不用说一个男人和一个孩子了。		
Some other men plunged thitherward with him, and more went along the road.	一些男人和他一起向那边冲过去，更多的人则是沿着路走。		
They were gone about twenty minutes altogether, returning without result to the inn.	他们总共走了大约二十分钟，就一无所获地回了旅馆。		
Ned sat down in the settle, and clasped his forehead with his hands.	内德坐在高背长椅上，双手紧紧抓着前额。		
‘Well—what a fool the man is, and hev been all these years, if he thinks the child his, as a’ do seem to!’ they whispered.	“哦——那个男人多蠢啊，这么多年了，他看起来好像还以为那孩子是他的！”他们悄声说，		
‘And everybody else knowing otherwise!’	“别人都知道那孩子不是他的！”		
‘No, I don’t think ’tis mine!’ cried Ned hoarsely, as he looked up from his hands.	“不，我知道孩子不是我的！”内德抬起头，嘶哑地吼道，		
‘But she is mine, all the same!	“但尽管如此，她还是我的！		
Ha’n’t I nussed her?	难道不是我照料她？		
Ha’n’t I fed her and teached her?	不是我喂养她、教导她？		
Ha’n’t I played wi’ her?	不是我和她玩耍？		
O, little Carry—gone with that rogue—gone!’	哦，小卡里——被那个混蛋带走了——带走了！”		
‘You ha’n’t lost your mis’ess, anyhow,’ they said to console him.	“不管怎么说，你的妻子没有丢。”他们安慰他说，		
‘She’s throwed up the sperrits, and she is feeling better, and she’s more to ’ee than a child that isn’t yours.’	“她已经甩掉恶魔，现在好些了，对你来说，她比那个不是你亲生的孩子更重要。”		
‘She isn’t!	“不！		
She’s not so particular much to me, especially now she’s lost the little maid!	她对我并没那么重要，尤其是现在她把孩子丢了！		
But Carry’s everything!’	卡里才是一切！”		
‘Well, ver’ like you’ll find her to-morrow.’	“哦，很可能你明天就能找到她。”		
‘Ah—but shall I?	“啊——但我能吗？		
Yet he can’t hurt her—surely he can’t!	不过他不会伤害她——绝对不会！		
Well—how’s Car’line now?	啊——卡罗琳现在怎么样了？		
I am ready.	我准备好了。		
Is the cart here?’	马车来了吗？”		
She was lifted into the vehicle, and they sadly lumbered on toward Stickleford.	她被抬上马车，然后他们伤心地朝斯蒂克福德缓慢前进。		
Next day she was calmer; but the fits were still upon her; and her will seemed shattered.	第二天，她平静了一些，但痉挛还是时有发作，她的意志似乎被摧毁了。		
For the child she appeared to show singularly little anxiety, though Ned was nearly distracted.	奇怪的是，她看上去并不是很担心孩子，而内德却几乎要发疯了。		
It was nevertheless quite expected that the impish Mop would restore the lost one after a freak of a day or two; but time went on, and neither he nor she could be heard of, and Hipcroft murmured that perhaps he was exercising upon her some unholy musical charm, as he had done upon Car’line herself.	然而，大家还是希望爱搞恶作剧的“大拖把”只是一时兴起，一两天内就会把孩子送回来。但是随着时间的流逝，不管是“大拖把”还是孩子都没有消息。内德自言自语说，或许“大拖把”正在用音乐向她施加邪恶的魔力，正如他对卡罗琳所做的一样。		
Weeks passed, and still they could obtain no clue either to the fiddler’s whereabouts or the girl’s; and how he could have induced her to go with him remained a mystery.	一周又一周过去了，不管是小提琴手还是小女孩的下落，他们都没有任何线索。他是如何引她跟他走的，还是一个谜。		
Then Ned, who had obtained only temporary employment in the neighbourhood, took a sudden hatred toward his native district, and a rumour reaching his ears through the police that a somewhat similar man and child had been seen at a fair near London, he playing a violin, she dancing on stilts, a new interest in the capital took possession of Hipcroft with an intensity which would scarcely allow him time to pack before returning thither.	内德在附近只找到一份临时的工作。他突然对家乡产生了一种怨恨。他从警察那里听到传闻，说有人曾在伦敦附近的集市见过类似的男人和小孩，大人拉小提琴，小孩踩着高跷跳舞。于是，内德又对首都产生了极浓烈的新兴趣，几乎没怎么收拾就回去了。		
He did not, however, find the lost one, though he made it the entire business of his over-hours to stand about in by-streets in the hope of discovering her, and would start up in the night, saying, ‘That rascal’s torturing her to maintain him!’	然而，尽管他所有的空余时间都站在小巷附近，希望能够发现她，他还是没能找到孩子。晚上，他会突然惊起，说：“那个混蛋会折磨她，让她养活他！”		
 To which his wife would answer peevishly, ‘Don’t ’ee raft yourself so, Ned!	对此，他的妻子会暴躁地回应：“不要自寻烦恼，内德！		
You prevent my getting a bit o’ rest!	你就不能让我休息一会儿！		
He won’t hurt her!’ and fall asleep again.	他不会伤害她的！”然后再度入睡。		
That Carry and her father had emigrated to America was the general opinion; Mop, no doubt, finding the girl a highly desirable companion when he had trained her to keep him by her earnings as a dancer.	人们普遍认为，卡里和父亲已经移民美洲。毫无疑问，当“大拖把”训练好她，让她跳舞赚钱养活自己时，他发现她是个称心如意的伴侣。		
There, for that matter, they may be performing in some capacity now, though he must be an old scamp verging on threescore-and-ten, and she a woman of four-and-forty.	另外，他们在美洲的演艺事业或许已经小有成就，但他肯定是个快70的老流氓，而她也是个44岁的妇人了。
