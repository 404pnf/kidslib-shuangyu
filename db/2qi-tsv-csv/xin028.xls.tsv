Clair de Lune	月光
by Guy de Maupassant	作者：莫泊桑
Abbe Marignan’s martial name suited him well.	马里尼昂神父的姓带有尚武之意，他配得上使用这个姓。
He was a tall, thin priest, fanatic, excitable, yet upright.	他是个高高瘦瘦的神父，有着狂热的宗教信仰，情绪极易激动，但他是个正直的人。
All his beliefs were fixed, never varying.	他对他的一切信仰坚信不疑，从不动摇。
He believed sincerely that he knew his God, understood His plans, desires and intentions.	他发自内心地相信自己是了解上帝的，并能够领会他的计划、愿望和意图的。
When he walked with long strides along the garden walk of his little country parsonage, he would sometimes ask himself the question: “Why has God done this?” And he would dwell on this continually, putting himself in the place of God, and he almost invariably found an answer.	当他阔步走在他的乡村小公馆的花园里时，他有时会问自己：“上帝为什么要这样做呢？”然后他会设身处地地将自己置于上帝的位置，不断地沉思细想，而且他几乎总是能找到答案。
He would never have cried out in an outburst of pious humility: “Thy ways, O Lord, are past finding out.”	他从来不会突然迸发出虔诚的谦逊的情感冲动，大喊道：“主啊，您的踪迹何其难寻！”
He said to himself: “I am the servant of God; it is right for me to know the reason of His deeds, or to guess it if I do not know it.”	他对自己说：“我是上帝的仆人；我应该要知道上帝的一举一动背后的缘由，即使不知道也要猜出来。”
Everything in nature seemed to him to have been created in accordance with an admirable and absolute logic.	在他看来，大自然的一切现象都是按照一种完美的、妙不可言的逻辑创造出来的。
The “whys” and “becauses” always balanced.	“为什么”和“因为”总是平衡的。
Dawn was given to make our awakening pleasant, the days to ripen the harvest, the rains to moisten it, the evenings for preparation for slumber, and the dark nights for sleep.	黎明的存在是为了使人醒来时感到欢愉，白昼的存在是为了让庄稼丰收成熟，雨水的存在是为了浇灌庄稼，夜晚的存在是为了入眠而准备，黑夜的存在则是为了使人安睡。
The four seasons corresponded perfectly to the needs of agriculture, and no suspicion had ever come to the priest of the fact that nature has no intentions; that, on the contrary, everything which exists must conform to the hard demands of seasons, climates and matter.	四季完美地满足了农业生产的需要，神父从来没有想过这个事实——自然是没有意图的；正好相反，万物的存在必须服从季节、气候和物质的需要。
But he hated woman—hated her unconsciously, and despised her by instinct.	可是他讨厌女人——潜意识里憎恨女人，本能地轻视她们。
He often repeated the words of Christ: “Woman, what have I to do with thee?” and he would add: “It seems as though God, Himself, were dissatisfied with this work of His.” She was the tempter who led the first man astray, and who since then had ever been busy with her work of damnation, the feeble creature, dangerous and mysteriously affecting one. And even more than their sinful bodies, he hated their loving hearts.	“女人啊，我跟你有什么关系呢？”他经常重复耶稣的这句话，还说，“看来上帝本人对自己所创作的这个作品也不满意。”女人是引诱第一个男人误入歧途的罪人，并且从那以后一直不断地重复着这该死的勾当；女人是脆弱的、危险的、神秘而魅惑的生物。他厌恶她们那罪恶的躯体，更憎恶她们那颗多情的心。
He had often felt their tenderness directed toward himself, and though he knew that he was invulnerable, he grew angry at this need of love that is always vibrating in them.	他时常能感觉到她们对他怀有的柔情。尽管他知道自己是能自持的，但对她们内心里一直颤动着的爱的需要，他还是感到很生气。
According to his belief, God had created woman for the sole purpose of tempting and testing man. One must not approach her without defensive precautions and fear of possible snares.	依照他的信仰看来，上帝创造女人的唯一目的是为了勾引并考验男人。他认为，一个男人在接近女人时必须要小心谨慎、加以防范，并对可能会出现的陷阱有畏惧之心。
She was, indeed, just like a snare, with her lips open and her arms stretched out to man.	女人，的确就是一个陷阱，用她微张的双唇和张开的双臂来诱捕男人。
He had no indulgence except for nuns, whom their vows had rendered inoffensive; but he was stern with them, nevertheless, because he felt that at the bottom of their fettered and humble hearts the everlasting tenderness was burning brightly—that tenderness which was shown even to him, a priest.	他只有对修女才会宽容一些，因为她们立下誓言，承诺她们以后不会害人了；但他依然对她们很严格，因为他能感觉到，在她们那被束缚的、谦逊的内心里，那股永恒的柔情一直在激情地燃烧着——这柔情甚至向他——一个神父——流露出来。
He felt this cursed tenderness, even in their docility, in the low tones of their voices when speaking to him, in their lowered eyes, and in their resigned tears when he reproved them roughly.	甚至当他和她们说话时，从她们温顺低沉的语调里，从她们低垂的眼睛里；当他严厉训斥她们时，从她们委屈的泪水里，他都感觉到了这该死的温柔。
And he would shake his cassock on leaving the convent doors, and walk off, lengthening his stride as though flying from danger.	当他快走出女修道院的门口时，他会抖一抖他的教士服，然后加大步伐，快速离开，仿佛要逃离什么危险似的。
He had a niece who lived with her mother in a little house near him.	他有一个外甥女，和她的母亲一起住在他附近的一个小屋里。
He was bent upon making a sister of charity of her.	他一心想让她成为仁爱会的修女。
She was a pretty, brainless madcap.	她长得很漂亮，但是举止轻率，行为鲁莽。
When the abbe preached she laughed, and when he was angry with her she would give him a hug, drawing him to her heart, while he sought unconsciously to release himself from this embrace which nevertheless filled him with a sweet pleasure, awakening in his depths the sensation of paternity which slumbers in every man.	当神父在传教布道时，她就会大笑；当他对她发脾气时，她就给他一个拥抱，把他搂在心口，然而他会不知不觉地将自己从这个充满甜蜜快感的拥抱中挣脱出来。这个拥抱唤醒了沉睡在他内心深处的、每个男人与生俱来的父爱感。
Often, when walking by her side, along the country road, he would speak to her of God, of his God. She never listened to him, but looked about her at the sky, the grass and flowers, and one could see the joy of life sparkling in her eyes.	当他和她并肩走在乡间小路上时，他常常会跟她讲述上帝，他的上帝。但她从没有认真地听他讲过，而是四下张望，看看天空，看看花草树木，眼里闪烁着对生活的喜悦。
Sometimes she would dart forward to catch some flying creature, crying out as she brought it back: “Look, uncle, how pretty it is! I want to hug it!” 	有时她会扑上前抓一些飞虫，然后尖叫着跑回来：“看，舅舅，多么漂亮啊！我想抱抱它！”
And this desire to “hug” flies or lilac blossoms disquieted, angered, and roused the priest, who saw, even in this, the ineradicable tenderness that is always budding in women’s hearts.	然而，这种想“抱抱”飞虫或紫丁香花的愿望却让神父感到很生气，焦躁不安。即使在这里，神父还是看到了在女人内心里含苞待放且无法根除的柔情。
Then there came a day when the sexton’s wife, who kept house for Abbe Marignan, told him, with caution, that his niece had a lover.	然后有一天，为神父看管房子的一个教堂司事的妻子小心翼翼地告诉他，说他的外甥女有一个情人。
Almost suffocated by the fearful emotion this news roused in him, he stood there, his face covered with soap, for he was in the act of shaving.	听到这个消息后，心里产生的恐惧感几乎令他窒息。他一动不动地站在那里，满脸肥皂泡，因为他正在刮胡子。
When he had sufficiently recovered to think and speak he cried: “It is not true; you lie, Melanie!”	当他完全恢复过来，能思考能说话时，他喊道：“梅拉妮，这不是真的，你在说谎！”
But the peasant woman put her hand on her heart, saying: “May our Lord judge me if I lie, Monsieur le Cure!	但这个农妇把手放在胸口，说：“神父先生，如果我说谎，就让上帝惩罚我！
I tell you, she goes there every night when your sister has gone to bed. They meet by the river side; you have only to go there and see, between ten o’clock and midnight.”	我跟您说，每天晚上您姐姐睡后，她就会去那儿。他们总是在河畔约会，大约在十点到半夜之间，您去看看就知道了。”
He ceased scraping his chin, and began to walk up and down impetuously, as he always did when he was in deep thought.	他停止了刮胡子，急躁地在房间里来回走动——当他陷入沉思时他总会这样。
When he began shaving again he cut himself three times from his nose to his ear.	当他再次刮胡子时，从鼻子到耳朵，他连着刮破了三次。
All day long he was silent, full of anger and indignation.	整整一天他都怀着满心的愤怒和羞辱，沉默不语。
To his priestly hatred of this invincible love was added the exasperation of her spiritual father, of her guardian and pastor, deceived and tricked by a child, and the selfish emotion shown by parents when their daughter announces that she has chosen a husband without them, and in spite of them.	作为神父，他本来就厌恶这种不可征服的情爱。更让他怒不可遏的是，作为她的精神教父、监护人和牧师，他竟然被一个孩子欺骗和玩弄了。这种自我的情绪，也就是做父母在听到女儿宣布，在他们不知情也不同意的情况下找了一个丈夫时所表现出来的。
After dinner he tried to read a little, but could not, growing more and, more angry.	晚饭后，他试着读一会儿书，但他读不下去，越想越生气。
When ten o’clock struck he seized his cane, a formidable oak stick, which he was accustomed to carry in his nocturnal walks when visiting the sick.	十点的时候，他拿起自己的手杖，这是一根结实的橡木棍。通常在夜间看望病人时，他会带着它。
And he smiled at the enormous club which he twirled in a threatening manner in his strong, country fist.	然后他望着这根巨大的棍棒笑了笑，用他乡下人的强壮的拳头，快速地轮转着它，甚是逼人。
Then he raised it suddenly and, gritting his teeth, brought it down on a chair, the broken back of which fell over on the floor.	然后他突然把它举起来，牙齿咬得格格响，向一把椅子砸去，顿时椅背断裂，倒在地上。
He opened the door to go out, but stopped on the sill, surprised by the splendid moonlight, of such brilliance as is seldom seen.	他打开门准备出去。但在门口停住了脚步，他惊讶于眼前皎洁的月光，这样的月光他几乎不曾见过。
And, as he was gifted with an emotional nature, one such as had all those poetic dreamers, the Fathers of the Church, he felt suddenly distracted and moved by all the grand and serene beauty of this pale night.	由于他天生比较情绪化，正如那些充满诗意的梦想家和教父一样。淡淡的夜色充满了高贵和宁静的美，他突然被这美妙的夜晚分了心，心中泛起一阵感动。
In his little garden, all bathed in soft light, his fruit trees in a row cast on the ground the shadow of their slender branches, scarcely in full leaf, while the giant honeysuckle, clinging to the wall of his house, exhaled a delicious sweetness, filling the warm moonlit atmosphere with a kind of perfumed soul.	在他的小花园里，一切都沐浴在柔和的月光里。他的那些果树，排列成行，纤细枝条的倩影投映在小径上，树上的叶子还没长满。巨大的金银花藤顺着他房子的墙壁爬行，散发着香甜醉人的气息，花朵的芬芳溢满了温暖的月色下的每一个角落。
He began to take long breaths, drinking in the air as drunkards drink wine, and he walked along slowly, delighted, marveling, almost forgetting his niece.	他开始深呼吸，就像酒鬼喝酒那样大口大口地吸着空气。他慢慢地走着，沉浸在喜悦和惊喜中，几乎忘了他侄女的事。
As soon as he was outside of the garden, he stopped to gaze upon the plain all flooded with the caressing light, bathed in that tender, languishing charm of serene nights.	一走出花园，他就停下来，凝神注视着整个平原，它淹没在轻柔的月光里，沐浴着静夜的温柔与爱意。
At each moment was heard the short, metallic note of the cricket, and distant nightingales shook out their scattered notes—their light, vibrant music that sets one dreaming, without thinking, a music made for kisses, for the seduction of moonlight.	这时，传来了蟋蟀短促的、金属般的鸣声。远处夜莺舒展歌喉，啁啾啼啭，它们那轻快活泼的歌声让人摒弃思考，宛若置身梦境，在这迷人的月光下，为亲吻伴奏。
The abbe walked on again, his heart failing, though he knew not why.	神父重新朝前走去，他自己也不知道为什么心软下来了。
He seemed weakened, suddenly exhausted; he wanted to sit down, to rest there, to think, to admire God in His works.	突然，他感到精疲力竭，有些虚弱。他想在那里坐下来，休息一会儿，去思考和欣赏上帝创造的作品。
Down yonder, following the undulations of the little river, a great line of poplars wound in and out. A fine mist, a white haze through which the moonbeams passed, silvering it and making it gleam, hung around and above the mountains, covering all the tortuous course of the water with a kind of light and transparent cotton.	远处，沿着波光粼粼的小河，蜿蜒着一长排的白杨树。一层白色的薄雾浮在山的上方，月光穿透过去，照亮了它，使它银光闪闪，好像把整个曲曲折折的河道笼罩在一种轻盈、透明的棉花里。
The priest stopped once again, his soul filled with a growing and irresistible tenderness.	神父再一次停下来，心里涌起了一阵越来越强烈的、不可抗拒的温柔。
And a doubt, a vague feeling of disquiet came over him; he was asking one of those questions that he sometimes put to himself.	随后一种模模糊糊的、说不清的躁动感袭上心头。他想起了自己经常问自己的那个问题：
“Why did God make this?	“上帝为什么要这么做呢？
Since the night is destined for sleep, unconsciousness, repose, forgetfulness of everything, why make it more charming than day, softer than dawn or evening?	既然黑夜的存在是为了使人忘记一切，让人平静下来，让人安眠，那么为什么上帝要让它比白昼更迷人，比黎明和傍晚更温柔呢？
And does why this seductive planet, more poetic than the sun, that seems destined, so discreet is it, to illuminate things too delicate and mysterious for the light of day, make the darkness so transparent?	这个充满魅力的星球，比太阳更加富有诗情画意，它是那么小心谨慎，似乎是专门为照亮那些对于白昼来说太微妙也太神秘的万物而准备的，为什么它将黑夜变得如此透明呢？”
“Why does not the greatest of feathered songsters sleep like the others?	“为什么那些最善唱的鸟儿不像其他鸟儿一样睡眠呢？
Why does it pour forth its voice in the mysterious night?	为什么它们要在这样神秘的夜晚里开喉歌唱呢？”
“Why this half-veil cast over the world?	“为什么有这层朦胧的薄雾笼罩人间呢？
Why these tremblings of the heart, this emotion of the spirit, this enervation of the body?	为什么心灵会颤动，情绪会激动，身体会无力呢？
Why this display of enchantments that human beings do not see, since they are lying in their beds?	既然人们夜晚躺在床上睡着了，看不见了，那么上帝为什么还要展示这样的美景呢？
For whom is destined this sublime spectacle, this abundance of poetry cast from heaven to earth?”	这些从天上洒向人间的超群的诗情画意又是为谁而准备的呢？”
And the abbe could not understand.	神父弄不明白了。
But see, out there, on the edge of the meadow, under the arch of trees bathed in a shining mist, two figures are walking side by side.	但是，就在那里，草地的边上，瞧，两个并肩走着的身影出现在被发亮的薄雾浸湿的树木形成的穹顶下。
The man was the taller, and held his arm about his sweetheart’s neck and kissed her brow every little while.	小伙子更高一些，他用手臂搂着心上人的脖子，时不时地亲吻她的额头。
They imparted life, all at once, to the placid landscape in which they were framed as by a heavenly hand.	霎那间，他们的出现为周围平静的景致注入了活力，这般良宵美景似乎是上天专门为他们打造的。
The two seemed but a single being, the being for whom was destined this calm and silent night, and they came toward the priest as a living answer, the response his Master sent to his questionings.	他们两人似乎融成了一个人，这样沉寂安详的夜晚似乎是为他们创造的。他们朝神父走来，这似乎是上帝在为他解答疑惑——一个活生生的答案。
He stood still, his heart beating, all upset; and it seemed to him that he saw before him some biblical scene, like the loves of Ruth and Boaz, the accomplishment of the will of the Lord, in some of those glorious stories of which the sacred books tell.	他站在那里一动不动，心怦怦地跳，不知所措。似乎眼前的景象就是他之前在圣经中见过的场景，就像鲁思和波阿斯的爱情，上帝的旨意在圣经所讲述的那些神圣的故事中实现了。
The verses of the Song of Songs began to ring in his ears, the appeal of passion, all the poetry of this poem replete with tenderness.	神父的耳边开始响起《雅歌》的诗句，那些热情的召唤，那首充满着柔情的诗歌中的全部火热的诗意。
And he said unto himself: “Perhaps God has made such nights as these to idealize the love of men.”	他想：“也许上帝创造这样的夜晚就是为了使人类的爱情更加完美吧！”
He shrank back from this couple that still advanced with arms intertwined.	这对情侣挽着手一直往前走，神父在他们面前退缩了。
Yet it was his niece.	尽管那个女孩子是他的外甥女。
But he asked himself now if he would not be disobeying God. And does not God permit love, since He surrounds it with such visible splendor?	但此时他问自己，自己这样做会违背上帝的意愿吗？既然上帝用如此美好的夜色点缀爱情，难道他会不容许有爱情吗？
And he went back musing, almost ashamed, as if he had intruded into a temple where he had, no right to enter.	他一边思考着，一边羞愧地逃离了，好似闯入了一座他没权利进入的神殿。
