"书名      阳阳和月月短简介    阳阳和月月是两个小家伙，一天晚上，家里忙着准备晚宴，厨娘带着他们欣赏了她和助手亲手准备的晚餐，这些食物不仅非常丰盛，而且非常漂亮，它们被做成各种形状，其中最漂亮的是做成一座粉红色小房子形状的冰激凌。阳阳看到这些食物，问道，客人们会吃这些食物吗？那么，晚宴结束后，客人们吃掉这些食物了吗？阳阳看到晚宴后的情形会是怎么样呢？长简介    凯瑟琳·曼斯菲尔德的短篇小说《阳阳和月月》主要描写了孩子的幻灭感。小说开头，家里的仆人们忙进忙出准备着一场盛大的晚宴，没有人顾得上阳阳和月月这两个小家伙。厨娘和助手高兴地向阳阳和月月展示着她的作品，一顿不仅丰盛而且更精美的晚餐，这些食物都被做成了各式各样的图案，其中阳阳最喜欢的是做成粉红色小房子形状的冰激凌。晚宴结束之后，当阳阳看到餐厅里一片狼藉，他最心爱的小房子冰激凌被毁掉之后，不禁大哭，他觉得太可怕了，无法接受自己想象中的美好的事物被毁掉的现实。关键字阳阳和月月；曼斯菲尔德；外研社编译组；短篇；儿童；幻想；毁灭作者（英）凯瑟琳·曼斯菲尔德作者简介凯瑟琳·曼斯菲尔德（1888—1923），英国作家。她的创作有短篇小说、诗和文学评论，并与人合译过契诃夫和高尔基的作品。凯瑟琳·曼斯菲尔德的小说大多揭露社会的黑暗，但也有少数作品表现了生的欣悦。她在艺术上深受契诃夫的启发，不设奇局，不求曲折的情节，注重从看似平凡的小处发掘人物情绪的变化。文笔简洁优美流畅，表达细腻含蓄，富有诗意。书评曼斯菲尔德本人非常喜爱俄罗斯文化，她的写作风格深受俄国作家的影响。她刻画人物细腻入微，时常在情节上精雕细琢，被称为“英国的契诃夫”。是什么毁灭了阳阳的幻想呢？"
"Sun and Moon","阳阳和月月 "
"by Katherine Mansfield","作者：凯瑟琳·曼斯菲尔德"
"In the afternoon the chairs came, a whole big cart full of little gold ones with their legs in the air.","下午很多椅子运来了，一辆大卡车上装满了金色的小椅子，全都倒放着。"
"And then the flowers came.","接着花也运到了。"
"When you stared down from the balcony at the people carrying them the flower pots looked like funny awfully nice hats nodding up the path.","站在阳台上往下看，看着人们运送着一盆盆花，这些花就像一顶顶非常有趣的帽子，头一点一点地沿着小路往房子里走。"
"Moon thought they were hats.","月月还以为它们就是帽子。"
"She said: “Look.","她说：“看啊，"
"There’s a man wearing a palm on his head.”","有一个人头上戴着棕榈呢。”"
"But she never knew the difference between real things and not real ones.","但是，她从来也没弄清真东西和假东西之间的区别。"
"There was nobody to look after Sun and Moon.","没有人来照顾阳阳和月月。"
"Nurse was helping Annie alter Mother’s dress which was much-too-long-and-tight-under-the-arms and Mother was running all over the house and telephoning Father to be sure not to forget things.","保姆在帮助安妮改做妈妈的衣服，那件衣服太长，胳肢窝下面又太紧了；妈妈在整个房子里跑来跑去，打电话给爸爸，让他确认不要忘了东西。"
"She only had time to say: “Out of my way, children!”","她只有时间说：“别来烦我，孩子们！”"
"They kept out of her way—at any rate Sun did.","两个孩子没有去烦妈妈——至少阳阳是这样。"
"He did so hate being sent stumping back to the nursery.","他只是很讨厌被打发回儿童房，连他的步子也是气鼓鼓的。"
"It didn’t matter about Moon.","月月就没什么要紧的了。"
"If she got tangled in people’s legs they only threw her up and shook her till she squeaked.","如果她在大人腿边绊着了，他们只会把她往空中一举，晃得她连连尖叫。"
"But Sun was too heavy for that.","但是阳阳太重了，人们都举不动他。"
"He was so heavy that the fat man who came to dinner on Sundays used to say: “Now, young man, let’s try to lift you.”","他就是那么重，在星期天常来吃饭的那个胖子总爱说：“来，小伙子，让我们来试试，把你举起来。”"
"And then he’d put his thumbs under Sun’s arms and groan and try and give it up at last saying: “He’s a perfect little ton of bricks!","然后他把大拇指放在阳阳的胳肢窝下面，哼了几声，试了一试，最后还是放弃了：“他简直就是一小堆砖头！”"
"Nearly all the furniture was taken out of the dining-room.","餐厅里的家具几乎都被搬走了。"
"The big piano was put in a corner and then there came a row of flower pots and then there came the goldy chairs.","大钢琴被推到了墙角，接着搬来了一排花盆，然后又搬来了金色的椅子。"
"That was for the concert.","那是为了开音乐会吧。"
"When Sun looked in a white faced man sat at the piano—not playing, but banging at it and then looking inside.","阳阳朝里面看去，只见一个白色面孔的男人坐在钢琴旁——没有在弹钢琴，而是敲打了一阵，又看了看钢琴的内部，敲一敲，再看看钢琴内部。"
"He had a bag of tools on the piano and he had stuck his hat on a statue against the wall.","他的一袋工具放在钢琴上，他的帽子套在靠墙的一座雕像上。"
"Sometimes he just started to play and then he jumped up again and looked inside.","有时候，他刚开始弹琴，却又跳起来朝钢琴里面看。"
"Sun hoped he wasn’t the concert.","阳阳希望不是他要开音乐会。"
"But of course the place to be in was the kitchen.","当然了，最好的地方应该是厨房了。"
"There was a man helping in a cap like a blancmange, and their real cook, Minnie, was all red in the face and laughing.","厨房里有个来帮忙的男人，戴着顶像个牛奶冻的帽子；他们家真正的厨娘明妮，满脸红光，正大声地笑着。"
"Not cross at all.","她一点儿也不生气。"
"She gave them each an almond finger and lifted them up on to the flour bin so that they could watch the wonderful things she and the man were making for supper.","她给两个孩子每人一块杏仁手指饼，还把他们抱到面粉箱上，好让他们仔细瞧瞧，她和帮手正在为晚餐准备什么好吃的东西。"
"Cook brought in the things and he put them on dishes and trimmed them.","厨娘把东西拿进来，帮手把那些东西放在盘子里，还给它们装扮一下。"
"Whole fishes, with their heads and eyes and tails still on, he sprinkled with red and green and yellow bits; he made squiggles all over the jellies, he stuck a collar on a ham and put a very thin sort of a fork in it; he dotted almonds and tiny round biscuits on the creams.","整条的鱼，头、眼睛、尾巴都在；帮手把一些红的、绿的、黄的东西撒在鱼的上面；他还用奶油在果子冻上面描满了弯弯曲曲的花样；他把肉卷紧挨着火腿放，又把一根瘦瘦的像叉子样的东西插在火腿上；他在奶油上放一个个杏仁和小圆饼。"
"And more and more things kept coming.","还有越来越多的东西不断地送进来。"
"“Ah, but you haven’t seen the ice pudding,” said Cook.","“啊，你们俩还没看见那个冰布丁呢。”厨娘说，"
"“Come along.”","“快过来。”"
"Why was she being so nice, thought Sun as she gave them each a hand.","她一手搀着一个孩子，她今天怎么这么好，阳阳想。"
"And they looked into the refrigerator.","他们俩朝冰箱里面看过去。"
"Oh!","噢！"
"Oh!","噢！"
"Oh!","噢！"
"It was a little house.","这是一所小房子啊。"
"It was a little pink house with white snow on the roof and green windows and a brown door and stuck in the door there was a nut for a handle.","这是一座粉红色的小房子，屋顶上还堆着雪，还有绿色的窗子、棕色的房门，门上还嵌着一个用坚果做的把手。"
"When Sun saw the nut he felt quite tired and had to lean against Cook.","阳阳看到那个坚果时，感到很累了，他不得不把身子靠在厨娘身上。"
"“Let me touch it.","“让我摸一下它。"
"Just let me put my finger on the roof,” said Moon, dancing.","让我用手指头碰碰那屋顶吧。”月月说，一边跳起舞来。"
"She always wanted to touch all the food.","她看见吃的东西总想去碰碰。"
"Sun didn’t.","阳阳就不碰。"
"“Now, my girl, look sharp with the table,” said Cook as the housemaid came in.","“喂，我的姑娘，你帮我好好照看那边的桌子。”厨娘说道，这时女佣走了进来。"
"“It’s a picture, Min,” said Nellie.","“这就是一幅画啊，明。”内莉说道，"
"“Come along and have a look.”","“过来看一看吧。”"
"So they all went into the dining-room.","于是他们所有的人都走进了餐厅。"
"Sun and Moon were almost frightened.","阳阳和月月差一点儿吓呆了。"
"They wouldn’t go up to the table at first; they just stood at the door and made eyes at it.","一开始，他们俩不敢朝桌子走近一步；他们只是站在门口，瞪着眼睛往桌子上看。"
"It wasn’t real night yet but the blinds were down in the dining-room and the lights turned on—and all the lights were red roses.","其实还没到晚上，但是餐厅的窗帘已经拉下来了，灯也都打开了——所有的灯光都是玫瑰红色的。"
"Red ribbons and bunches of roses tied up the table at the corners.","桌子四角绑满了红色的缎带和一束束玫瑰花。"
"In the middle was a lake with rose petals floating on it.","餐桌中间有一个小水池，水上还漂着玫瑰花瓣。"
"“That’s where the ice pudding is to be,” said Cook.","“等会冰冻布丁就放在那儿。”厨娘说。"
"Two silver lions with wings had fruit on their backs, and the salt cellars were tiny birds drinking out of basins.","两只带翼的银狮子，背上放着水果；一只只在水池边喝水的小鸟就是盐瓶。"
"And all the winking glasses and shining plates and sparkling knives and forks—and all the food.","还有很多很多亮晶晶的玻璃杯子、闪亮的盘子、耀眼的刀叉——还有很多很多的食物。"
"And the little red table napkins made into roses....","还有小小的红色的餐巾，都折成了一朵朵玫瑰花……"
"“Are people going to eat the food?” asked Sun.","“人们会来吃这些食物吗？”阳阳问。"
"“I should just think they were,” laughed Cook, laughing with Nellie.","“我想他们应该会来吃吧。”厨娘笑着说，内莉也大笑起来。"
"Moon laughed, too; she always did the same as other people.","月月也笑了，她总是别人做什么，她就做什么。"
"But Sun didn’t want to laugh.","但是阳阳不想笑。"
"Round and round he walked with his hands behind his back.","他把双手放在背后，一圈一圈地绕着走。"
"Perhaps he never would have stopped if Nurse hadn’t called suddenly: “Now then, children. It’s high time you were washed and dressed.”","如果不是保姆突然叫他，也许他一直不会停下来，“喂，孩子们，是时候给你们洗脸穿衣服了。”"
"And they were marched off to the nursery.","于是孩子们大步朝儿童房走过去。"
"While they were being unbuttoned Mother looked in with a white thing over her shoulders; she was rubbing stuff on her face.","当他们正在解纽扣的时候，妈妈伸头进来看了一眼，她肩上披了一件白的东西；她正在往脸上搽些什么东西。"
"“I’ll ring for them when I want them, Nurse, and then they can just come down and be seen and go back again,” said she.","“我需要孩子们的时候，我会按铃，到时候保姆你就让他们俩下楼来，让大家看看，再让他们回楼上去。”她说。"
"Sun was undressed first, nearly to his skin, and dressed again in a white shirt with red and white daisies speckled on it, breeches with strings at the sides and braces that came over, white socks and red shoes.","阳阳已经先把衣服脱下来了，几乎全脱下了，接着又穿上一件白衬衫，衬衫上面点缀着都是红色和白色的雏菊，穿上了两边缀着带子的裤子，再套上背带，穿上了白色的袜子和红色的鞋子。"
"“Now you’re in your Russian costume,” said Nurse, flattening down his fringe.","“现在你可是一身俄国人的打扮了。”保姆说，一边帮他往下抚平流苏。"
"“Am I?” said Sun.","“我是吗？”阳阳问。"
"“Yes.","“是的。"
"Sit quiet in that chair and watch your little sister.”","安静地坐在那张椅子上，好好看好你的小妹妹。”"
"Moon took ages.","月月穿衣服可真是太慢了。"
"When she had her socks put on she pretended to fall back on the bed and waved her legs at Nurse as she always did, and every time Nurse tried to make her curls with a finger and a wet brush she turned round and asked Nurse to show her the photo of her brooch or something like that.","保姆帮她穿袜子的时候，她假装跌倒在床上，双脚朝着保姆乱摇乱动，她经常跟保姆来这一套；保姆每次用一只手指和一把湿刷子给她做卷发的时候，她总是转过身来，要保姆把她胸针上的小照片，或者是这一类的东西给她看。"
"But at last she was finished too.","但是最后她的衣服还是穿好了。"
"Her dress stuck out, with fur on it, all white; there was even fluffy stuff on the legs of her drawers.","她的衣服鼓鼓的，上面镶了白色的皮毛；在她的衬裤腿部还有绒毛呢。"
"Her shoes were white with big blobs on them.","她的鞋子是白色的，上面还有大绒球。"
"“There you are, my lamb,” said Nurse.","“看看你，我的小羊羔儿。”保姆说，"
"“And you look like a sweet little cherub of a picture of a powder-puff!”","“看你这小模样，就像那画在粉盒上甜美的小天使！”"
"Nurse rushed to the door.","保姆冲到门口。"
"“Ma’am, one moment.”","“夫人，请您过来一下吧。”"
"Mother came in again with half her hair down.","妈妈又进来了，一半的头发放了下来。"
"“Oh,” she cried.","“噢，”她叫道，"
"“What a picture!”","“真像画上的一样漂亮！”"
"“Isn’t she,” said Nurse.","“看她，不就像画上的一样漂亮嘛。”保姆说。"
"And Moon held out her skirts by the tips and dragged one of her feet.","月月提着两边的裙角，两脚张开，拖着一只脚。"
"Sun didn’t mind people not noticing him—much....","阳阳倒不怎么在乎别人不注意他——不怎么在乎……"
"After that they played clean tidy games up at the table while Nurse stood at the door, and when the carriages began to come and the sound of laughter and voices and soft rustlings came from down below she whispered: “Now then, children, stay where you are.”","穿好衣服后，两个孩子在桌子上玩纸牌这种干净整齐的东西，而保姆在门口看着他们。后来马车都来了，笑声、说话声、衣裙的窸窣声都从楼下传上来了，保姆轻声说：“现在，孩子们，都呆在原地别动。”"
"Moon kept jerking the table cloth so that it all hung down her side and Sun hadn’t any—and then she pretended she didn’t do it on purpose.","月月总是扯那桌布，结果桌布都挂到她这边来了，阳阳那边一点儿也没有了——她又假装自己不是有意这样做的。"
"At last the bell rang.","铃声终于响了。"
"Nurse pounced at them with the hair brush, flattened his fringe, made her bow stand on end, and joined their hands together.","保姆拿起头发刷子向他们冲过去，把阳阳的流苏抚平，把月月的蝴蝶结“立”起来，让兄妹俩手拉着手。"

"And down they went.","他们俩下楼去了。"

"At the drawing-room door stood Mother fanning herself with a black fan.","妈妈正站在客厅门口，手里拿着一把黑色的扇子扇着。"
"The drawing-room was full of sweet smelling, silky, rustling ladies and men in black with funny tails on their coats—like beetles.","客厅里面全都是香气袭人、穿着一身绸衣、窸窣作响的女客人们，还有穿着黑色衣服的男客人们，他们衣服后面有两条有趣的尾巴——像甲壳虫。"
"Father was among them, talking very loud, and rattling something in his pocket.","爸爸在他们中间，大声说着话，还把他衣服口袋里的什么东西弄出声响来。"
"“What a picture!” cried the ladies.","“真像画上的一样漂亮啊！”女客人们叫道，"

"Oh, the lambs!","噢，两只小羊羔儿！"
"Oh, the sweets!","噢，两个小甜心！"
"Oh, the pets!”","噢，两只小宠物！”"
"All the people who couldn’t get at Moon kissed Sun, and a skinny old lady with teeth that clicked said: “Such a serious little poppet,” and rapped him on the head with something hard.","所有没法接触到月月的人都去吻阳阳，一位瘦得皮包骨的老太太，说话时，牙齿跟牙齿碰出声音来，她说：“真是个严肃的小玩偶，”还用什么硬东西敲他的头顶。"
"Sun looked to see if the same concert was there, but he was gone.","阳阳想看看那个弹钢琴的人还在不在，但是他已经走了。"
"Instead, a fat man with a pink head leaned over the piano talking to a girl who held a violin at her ear.","这个时候，有一个胖子，粉红色的头皮，正凑在钢琴上面，和一个歪着头、把小提琴夹在肩头的女孩说话。"

"Then he went away.","然后他走开了。"
"But soon he came back again and said: “Fond of dogs?”","但是很快他又回来了，说：“喜欢狗吗？”"
"Sun said: “Yes.”","阳阳说：“喜欢。”"
"But then he went away again and though Sun looked for him everywhere he couldn’t find him.","但是他又走开了，尽管阳阳到处找他，都没有找到。"
"He thought perhaps he’d gone outside to fetch in a puppy.","阳阳心里想，也许他是要到外面去弄只小狗来吧。"
"“Good night, my precious babies,” said Mother, folding them up in her bare arms.","“晚安，我的小宝贝儿。”妈妈说，把他们包在她光滑的胳膊里，"
"“Fly up to your little nest.”","“快飞上楼，飞到你们的小窝里去吧。”"

"She put up her arms in front of everybody and said: “My Daddy must carry me.”","当着所有人的面，她把两手一举，说：“爸爸抱我上楼去。”"
"But they seemed to like it, and Daddy swooped down and picked her up as he always did.","不过大家好像喜欢这样，于是爸爸猛扑过去，把她举了起来，他常常这样做。"
"Nurse was in such a hurry to get them to bed that she even interrupted Sun over his prayers and said: “Get on with them, child, do.”","保姆一心想着要赶快把他们俩打发去睡觉，她也不管阳阳正在祷告，打断他说：“赶紧的，孩子们，赶快。”"

"Then that door was shut; there was a noise of “pops” and laughing.","客厅的那扇门又关上了；传来砰的一声响和一阵笑声。","","","","pops，应该是开啤酒的声音。"
"Then that stopped and Sun saw them all walking round and round the lovely table with their hands behind their backs like he had done.","后来笑声停下来了，阳阳看见大家围着那张可爱的桌子转啊转啊，他们的双手都放在背后，就像他当初一样。"
