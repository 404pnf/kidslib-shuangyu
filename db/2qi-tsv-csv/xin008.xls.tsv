Father Grumbler	牢骚父亲
by Andrew Lang	作者：安德鲁·朗格
Once upon a time there lived a man who had nearly as many children as there were sparrows in the garden.	从前，有位父亲，家里的孩子几乎和花园里的麻雀一样多。
He had to work very hard all day to get them enough to eat, and was often tired and cross, and abused everything and everybody, so that people called him ‘Father Grumbler.’	他必须整天辛苦工作，才能给他们买足够的食物吃；他时常感到疲惫，性情乖戾，对任何事和所有人都口出恶言，所以人们叫他“牢骚父亲”。
By-and-by he grew weary of always working, and on Sundays he lay a long while in bed, instead of going to church.	没过多久，他渐渐对工作感到厌烦，而且每逢周日他也不去教堂，而是在床上躺很久。
Then after a time he found it dull to sit so many hours by himself, thinking of nothing but how to pay the rent that was owing, and as the tavern across the road looked bright and cheerful, he walked in one day and sat down with his friends.	过了一段时间之后，他发现独自一人坐上那么几个小时，脑子里只想着怎么交欠下的房租，这样真是没劲。由于马路对面的小酒馆看上去明亮又欢快，于是有一天他走了进去，和他的朋友们坐在了一起。
‘It was just to chase away Care,’ he said; but when he came out, hours and hours after, Care came out with him.	“这刚好能赶走忧愁。”他说道。但几个小时后，忧愁又伴随着他走出了酒馆。
Father Grumbler entered his house feeling more dismal than when he left it, for he knew that he had wasted both his time and his money.	走进家门的时候，牢骚父亲感到比离开家时更加沮丧，因为他知道自己既浪费了时间又浪费了金钱。
‘I will go and see the Holy Man in the cave near the well,’ he said to himself, ‘and perhaps he can tell me why all the luck is for other people, and only misfortunes happen to me.’	“我要去见一见那位住在水井附近山洞里的圣人，”他自言自语道，“也许他能告诉我为什么好运都是别人的，而我碰到的只有霉运。”
And he set out at once for the cave.	于是他立即动身前往那个山洞。
It was a long way off, and the road led over mountains and through valleys; but at last he reached the cave where the Holy Man dwelt, and knocked at the door.	到达山洞有一段漫长的路要走，而且途中要翻越大山，还要穿过河谷；但最终他还是到达了圣人居住的山洞，然后他敲了敲门。
‘Who is there?’ asked a voice from within.	“是哪位？”里面传来一个声音问道。
‘It is I, Holy Man, Father Grumbler, you know, who has as many children as sparrows in the garden.’	“是我，圣人先生，你知道的，我就是那位孩子和花园里的麻雀一样多的牢骚父亲。”
‘Well, and what is it that you want?’	“哦，那你想要什么呢？”
‘I want to know why other people have all the luck, and only misfortunes happen to me!’	“我想知道为什么所有的好运都让别人碰上，而我碰到的只有霉运！”
The Holy Man did not answer, but went into an inner cave, from which he came out bearing something in his hand.	圣人没有回答，而是朝里边的一个洞穴走了进去，出来时手里拿着一样东西。
‘Do you see this basket?’ said he.	“看到这篮子了吗？”他说，
‘It is a magical basket, and if you are hungry you have only got to say: “Little basket, little basket, do your duty,” and you will eat the best dinner you ever had in your life.	“这是一只魔法篮子，如果你饿了，只需说：‘小篮子，小篮子，做你该做的事。’你就能吃到你这辈子吃过的最好的饭菜。
But when you have had enough, be sure you don’t forget to cry out: “That will do for to-day.”	但如果你吃饱了，一定不要忘记大声说：‘今天的够了。’
Oh!—and one thing more—you need not show it to everybody and declare that I have give it to you.	噢——还有一件事——你不必到处向人们炫耀，说篮子是我送的。
Do you understand?’	你明白了吗？”
Father Grumbler was always accustomed to think of himself as so unlucky that he did not know whether the Holy Man was not playing a trick upon him; but he took the basket without being polite enough to say either ‘Thank you,’ or ‘Good-morning,’ and went away.	牢骚父亲总是习惯于认为自己非常不幸，所以他弄不清楚圣人是不是在捉弄他；但他还是接过了篮子，连一声足够礼貌的“谢谢”或“早上好”都没有说，就离开了。
However, he only waited till he was out of sight of the cave before he stooped down and whispered: ‘Little basket, little basket, do your duty.’	然而，他一出山洞圣人的视线范围，就迫不及待地弯下腰低声说：“小篮子，小篮子，做你该做的事。”
Now the basket had a lid, so that he could not see what was inside, but he heard quite clearly strange noises, as if a sort of scuffling was going on.	由于篮子有一个盖子盖着，所以他看不见篮子里面有什么，但他很清晰地听到了奇怪的响声，有点儿像正在进行的一场混战。
Then the lid burst open, and a quantity of delicious little white rolls came tumbling out one after the other, followed by a stream of small fishes all ready cooked.	随后盖子突然打开了，一些美味的白色小面包卷就一个接一个跑了出来，接着是一连串煮熟了的小鱼。
What a quantity there were to be sure!	数量真是太多了！
The whole road was covered with them, and the banks on each side were beginning to disappear.	整条路都被它们盖满了，路两边的斜坡也开始消失。
Father Grumbler felt quite frightened at the torrent, but at last he remembered what the Holy Man had told him, and cried at the top of his voice: ‘Enough! enough!	牢骚父亲看到这食物的洪流，害怕极了，但最终他还是想起了圣人对他说过的话，于是他用最大的嗓门喊道：“够了！够了！
That will do for to-day!’	今天的够了！”
And the lid of the basket closed with a snap.	于是篮子盖咔哒一声合上了。
Father Grumbler sighed with relief and happiness as he looked around him, and sitting down on a heap of stones, he ate till he could eat no more.	牢骚父亲环顾四周，放心且高兴地舒了口气，然后坐在一堆石头上，一直吃到再吃不下才停下。
Trout, salmon, turbot, soles, and a hundred other fishes whose names he did not know, lay boiled, fried, and grilled within reach of his hands.	鲑鱼、三文鱼、多宝鱼、鳎目鱼，还有其他许多他叫不上名字的鱼，煮的、炸的，还有烤的，他都伸手就能够到。
As the Holy Man had said, he had never eaten such a dinner; still, when he had done, he shook his head, and grumbled; ‘Yes, there is plenty to eat, of course, but it only makes me thirsty, and there is not a drop to drink anywhere.’	正如圣人说的一样，他从来没有吃过这样的一顿饭菜；尽管如此，当他吃完后，他还是摇了摇头，抱怨道：“没错，是有很多吃的，当然了，但这只会把我给弄渴了，却哪儿也找不到一滴能喝的东西。”
Yet, somehow, he could never tell why, he looked up and saw the tavern in front of him, which he thought was miles, and miles, and miles away.	然而，莫名其妙地，他也说不清为什么，他一抬头就看到那家小酒馆出现在自己面前。以前在他看来，这酒馆离他可是很远很远很远的。
‘Bring the best wine you have got, and two glasses, good mother,’ he said as he entered, ‘and if you are fond of fish there is enough here to feed the house.	“把你们最好的酒拿出来，要两杯，老板娘，”他一进门就说，“另外，要是你们喜欢吃鱼，我这里有足够整个酒馆的人吃的鱼。
Only there is no need to chatter about it all over the place.	唯一一点就是不要四处谈论这件事。
You understand?	你明白吗？
Eh?’	嗯？”
 And without waiting for an answer he whispered to the basket: ‘Little basket, little basket, do your duty.’	还不等老板娘回答，他就低声对魔法篮子说：“小篮子，小篮子，做你该做的事。”
 The innkeeper and his wife thought that their customer had gone suddenly mad, and watched him closely, ready to spring on him if he became violent; but both instinctively jumped backwards, nearly into the fire, as rolls and fishes of every kind came tumbling out of the basket, covering the tables and chairs and the floor, and even overflowing into the street.	客栈老板和他妻子心想他们这位客人突然疯了，便仔细观察他，准备好一旦他撒野就马上扑上去；但是看到面包卷和各种鱼从篮子里涌出来，铺满桌子、椅子和地板，甚至都要流到街上去了，俩人都本能地往后跳，差点儿跳到了火堆里。　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 
‘Be quick, be quick, and pick them up,’ cried the man.	“快，快，把它们捡起来，”牢骚父亲喊道，
‘And if these are not enough, there are plenty more to be had for the asking.’	“如果这些不够，只要提出要求，还会有很多。”
The innkeeper and his wife did not need telling twice.	这话客栈老板和妻子可不需要被叮嘱两遍。
Down they went on their knees and gathered up everything they could lay hands on.	他们俩跪下来，把他们能够抓到的都拾了起来。
But busy though they seemed, they found time to whisper to each other:	但尽管他们看似很忙，还是不忘互相耳语：
‘If we can only get hold of that basket it will make our fortune!’	“我们只要能得到那只篮子，就能发财了！”
So they began by inviting Father Grumbler to sit down to the table, and brought out the best wine in the cellar, hoping it might loosen his tongue.	于是他们开始行动，他们邀请牢骚父亲坐到桌子旁，然后拿出酒窖里最好的酒，希望酒能套出他的话。
But Father Grumbler was wiser than they gave him credit for, and though they tried in all manner of ways to find out who had given him the basket, he put them off, and kept his secret to himself.	但牢骚父亲比他们称赞得还要聪明，尽管他们使出各种方法想查出是谁送的篮子，他都一一搪塞过去，保守了秘密。
Unluckily, though he did not SPEAK, he did drink, and it was not long before he fell fast asleep.	他的确什么也没说，但不幸的是，他喝了酒，所以他很快就睡熟了。
Then the woman fetched from her kitchen a basket, so like the magic one that no one, without looking very closely, could tell the difference, and placed it in Father Grumbler’s hand, while she hid the other carefully away.	于是老板娘从她的厨房取来一只篮子，这篮子像极了魔法篮子，要不仔细观察，没人能分辨出它们的区别。老板娘把它放在牢骚父亲手里，小心翼翼地把魔法篮子藏了起来。
It was dinner time when the man awoke, and, jumping up hastily, he set out for home, where he found all the children gathered round a basin of thin soup, and pushing their wooden bowls forward, hoping to have the first spoonful.	牢骚父亲醒来时已是吃饭时间了，他急忙跳了起来，起身回家。到了家，他发现所有孩子都围拢在一盆稀粥旁，并把他们的木碗都往前伸，希望能喝上第一勺粥。
Their father burst into the midst of them, bearing his basket, and crying:	他们的父亲突然闯进他们中间，拿着他的篮子，喊道：
‘Don’t spoil your appetites, children, with that stuff.	“孩子们，别让那种东西破坏了你们的胃口。
Do you see this basket?	看到这篮子了吗？
Well, I have only got to say, “Little basket, little basket, do your duty,” and you will see what will happen.	嗯，我只需说：‘小篮子，小篮子，做你该做的事。”你们就能看到会发生什么。
Now you shall say it instead of me, for a treat.’	现在你们来替我说这句话，请自己吃一顿吧。”
The children, wondering and delighted, repeated the words, but nothing happened.	孩子们感到又惊奇又高兴，重复着那句话，但是什么也没发生。
Again and again they tried, but the basket was only a basket, with a few scales of fish sticking to the bottom, for the innkeeper’s wife had taken it to market the day before.	他们试了一遍又一遍，可篮子就仍只是一个篮子，篮子底上粘了几片鱼的鳞片，那是因为客栈老板的妻子前一天提着它去了趟市场。
‘What is the matter with the thing?’ cried the father at last, snatching the basket from them, and turning it all over, grumbling and swearing while he did so, under the eyes of his astonished wife and children, who did not know whether to cry or to laugh.	“这东西怎么了？”父亲最后吼了起来，从孩子们中间把篮子抢了过来，然后将它翻了个底朝天，一边还嘟囔和咒骂着什么。妻子和孩子们惊讶地看着他，哭笑不得。
‘It certainly smells of fish,’ he said, and then he stopped, for a sudden thought had come to him.	“这肯定是鱼的味道。”他说道，然后又止住，因为他突然闪过了一个念头。
‘Suppose it is not mine at all; supposing—Ah, the scoundrels!’	“我想这根本不是我的篮子；我想——噢，那两个无赖！”
And without listening to his wife and children, who were frightened at his strange conduct and begged him to stay at home, he ran across to the tavern and burst open the door.	他的妻子和孩子们被他奇怪的行为吓到了，于是哀求他呆在家里，可他没听他们的话，而是跑到酒馆，闯了进去。
‘Can I do anything for you, Father Grumbler?’ asked the innkeeper’s wife in her softest voice.	“想吃点儿什么，牢骚父亲？”客栈老板的妻子用她最温柔的声音问道。
‘I have taken the wrong basket—by mistake, of course,’ said he.	“我拿错了篮子——当然了，是无意拿错的，”他说，
‘Here is yours, will you give me back my own?’	“这才是你们的篮子，能把我的还给我吗？”
‘Why, what are you talking about?’ answered she.	“什么，你在说什么？”她答道，
‘You can see for yourself that there is no basket here.’	“你可以自己看看，这里没有什么篮子。”
And though Father Grumbler DID look, it was quite true that none was to be seen.	于是牢骚父亲真的去看了，确实没看到有篮子。
‘Come, take a glass to warm you this cold day,’ said the woman, who was anxious to keep him in a good temper, and as this was an invitation Father Grumbler never refused, he tossed it off and left the house.	“来吧，大冷的天来喝一杯，暖暖你的身子。”老板娘这样说，是急于稳住他的情绪。牢骚父亲也从来不会拒绝这样的邀请，他把酒一饮而尽，便离开了酒馆。
He took the road that led to the Holy Man’s cave, and made such haste that it was not long before he reached it.	他又沿着那条通往圣人住的山洞的路走去，他走得很急，不一会儿就到了。
‘Who is there?’ said a voice in answer to his knock.	“请问是哪位？”听到他的敲门声，一个声音问道。
‘It is me, it is me, Holy man.	“是我呀，是我，圣人先生。
You know quite well.	你很熟悉的。
Father Grumbler, who has as many children as sparrows in the garden.’	我是那位孩子和花园里的麻雀一样多的牢骚父亲。”
‘But, my good man, it was only yesterday that I gave you a handsome present.’	“可是，我的朋友，我昨天才给了你一个绝妙的礼物啊。”
‘Yes, Holy Man, and here it is.	“没错，圣人先生，而且那礼物就在这儿呢。
But something has happened, I don’t know what, and it won’t work any more.’	但是发生了一些事情，我不知道怎么了，反正它不再灵验了。”
‘Well, put it down.	“噢，把它放下吧。
I will go and see if I can find anything for you.’	我去看看还能不能找到什么可以给你的。”
In a few minutes the Holy Man returned with a cock under his arm.	几分钟后，圣人胳膊下夹着一只公鸡回来了。
‘Listen to me,’ he said, ‘whenever you want money, you only have to say: “Show me what you can do, cock,” and you will see some wonderful things.	“听我说，”他说道，“无论何时你需要钱，你只需说：‘公鸡，做你能做的给我看看。’然后你就能看到一些奇妙的事情发生。
But, remember, it is not necessary to let all the world into the secret.’	但是，要记住，没必要让全世界都知道这个秘密。”
‘Oh no, Holy Man, I am not so foolish as that.’	“噢，不会的，圣人先生，我没那么蠢。”
‘Nor to tell everybody that I gave it to you,’ went on the Holy Man.	“也不要告诉任何人公鸡是我送你的，”圣人继续说道，
‘I have not got these treasures by the dozen.’	“我可没有多少这样的宝物。”
And without waiting for an answer he shut the door.	然后没等牢骚父亲回答，他就关上了门。
As before, the distance seemed to have wonderfully shortened, and in a moment the tavern rose up in front of Father Grumbler.	像上次一样，这段路程似乎奇妙地缩短了，不一会儿，那家酒馆就出现在了牢骚父亲面前。
Without stopping to think, he went straight in, and found the innkeeper’s wife in the kitchen making a cake.	他都没停下想一想，就径直走了进去，他看到老板娘正在厨房里做蛋糕。
‘Where have you come from, with that fine red cock in your basket,’ asked she, for the bird was so big that the lid would not shut down properly.	“看你篮子里还装着那么漂亮的红公鸡，你从哪里弄来呀？”她问道，因为这鸟实在太大，盖子都没法好好合上。
‘Oh, I come from a place where they don’t keep these things by the dozen,’ he replied, sitting down in front of the table.	“哦，我从某个地方弄来的，在那里，人们像这样的东西可不多。”他回答道，坐在了桌前。
The woman said no more, but set before him a bottle of his favourite wine, and soon he began to wish to display his prize.	老板娘没再说什么，只是在他面前放了一瓶他最喜欢的酒。很快他就开始想展示他得到的礼物了。
‘Show me what you can do, cock,’ cried he.	“公鸡，做你能做的给我看看。”他喊道。
And the cock stood up and flapped his wings three times, crowing ‘coquerico’ with a voice like a trumpet, and at each crow there fell from his beak golden drops, and diamonds as large as peas.	只见公鸡站了起来，拍了三下翅膀，“喔喔喔”地叫着，那声音好像喇叭声，而且每叫一声，就有金粒从它嘴里掉下来，还有豌豆一般大小的钻石。
This time Father Grumbler did not invite the innkeeper’s wife to pick up his treasures, but put his own hat under the cock’s beak, so as to catch everything he let fall; and he did not see the husband and wife exchanging glances with each other which said, ‘That would be a splendid cock to put with our basket.’	这一次牢骚父亲没有邀请老板娘去捡他的宝物，而是把自己的帽子放在公鸡的嘴下方，以便接住从它嘴里掉下的每一样东西；而他也没看见那对夫妇在互相交换眼神，那眼神似乎在说：“这将是一只能和我们的篮子相配的公鸡。”
‘Have another glass of wine?’ suggested the innkeeper, when they had finished admiring the beauty of the cock, for they pretended not to have seen the gold or the diamonds.	他们夸奖完公鸡的美，却假装没有看到金子或钻石，客栈老板还建议道：“再喝杯酒怎么样？”
And Father Grumbler, nothing loth, drank one glass after another, till his head fell forward on the table, and once more he was sound asleep.	牢骚父亲也很乐意地喝了一杯又一杯，直到他的头向前倒在了桌子上，他又一次睡熟了。
Then the woman gently coaxed the cock from the basket and carried it off to her own poultry yard, from which she brought one exactly like it, and popped it in its place.	于是老板娘轻轻地把公鸡从篮子里哄出来，把它拿到自家的家禽院子里，再从里面抓了一只长得一模一样的，然后迅速把它放在了篮子里。
Night was falling when the man awoke, and throwing proudly some grains of gold on the table to pay for the wine he had drunk, he tucked the cock comfortably into his basket and set out for home.	牢骚父亲醒来时天快要黑了，他得意地往桌上扔了几颗金子，付他喝的酒钱，然后把公鸡舒舒服服地往篮子里一塞，便起身回家了。
His wife and all the children were waiting for him at the door, and as soon as she caught sight of him she broke out:	他的妻子和所有的孩子站在门口等他，一见到他，妻子就爆发了：
‘You are a nice man to go wasting your time and your money drinking in that tavern, and leaving us to starve!	“你真是个‘好男人’啊，去酒馆喝酒，浪费时间又浪费金钱，却把我们扔在家里挨饿！
Aren’t you ashamed of yourself?’	你难道不为自己感到羞愧吗？”
‘You don’t know what you are talking of,’ he answered.	“你都不知道自己说些什么。”他回答道，
‘Money?	“钱？
Why, I have gold and diamonds now, as much as I want.	嗨，我现在有金子有钻石，要多少有多少。
Do you see that cock?	看到那只公鸡没？
Well, you have only to say to him, “Show me what you can do, cock,” and something splendid will happen.’	哦，你只需对它说，‘公鸡，做你能做的给我看看，’就会有奇迹发生。”
Neither wife nor children were inclined to put much faith in him after their last experience; however, they thought it was worth trying, and did as he told them.	有了上一次的经验，妻子和孩子们都不太愿意相信他的话；不过，他们心想这还是值得去试一试，便照他说的做了。
The cock flew round the room like a mad thing, and crowed till their heads nearly split with the noise; but no gold or diamonds dropped on the brick floor—not the tiniest grain of either.	这只公鸡发疯一般围着屋子乱飞，一直啼叫着，直到这噪音快把大家的头给撕裂了；但既没有金子也没有钻石掉到砖地上——很小很小的颗粒都没有。
Father Grumbler stared in silence for an instant, and then he began to swear so loudly that even his family, accustomed as they were to his language, wondered at him.	牢骚父亲一时间说不上话来，盯着公鸡看，然后开始大声咒骂，这架势让已经习惯了他骂街的全家人都感到吃惊。
At last he grew a little quieter, but remained as puzzled as ever.	最后，他平静了些，但仍百思不得其解。
‘Can I have forgotten the words?	“可能我把咒语给忘记了？
But I KNOW that was what he said!	可我的确知道他就是那样说的呀！
And I saw the diamonds with my own eyes!’	而且我还亲眼看见钻石了呢！”
 Then suddenly he seized the cock, shut it into the basket, and rushed out of the house.	然后他突然抓住公鸡，把它关进篮子，冲出家门。
His heavy wooden shoes clattered as he ran along the road, and he made such haste that the stars were only just beginning to come out when he reached the cave of the Holy Man.	他沿路跑去，他那双笨重的木头鞋一路咔哒咔哒地响着，他跑得太快，所以当他到达圣人住的山洞时，星星才刚刚挂上天空。
‘Who is that knocking?’ asked a voice from within.	“是谁在敲门？”洞里传来声音问。
‘It is me!	“是我！
It is me!	是我呀！
Holy Man! you know!	圣人先生！你认识我！
Father—’	我是那位父亲——”
‘But, my good fellow, you really should give some one else a chance.	“可是，我的朋友，你真该给别人一次机会。
This is the third time you have been—and at such an hour, too!’	这已经是你第三次——并且都是在这样的时间！”
‘Oh, yes, Holy Man, I know it is very late, but you will forgive me!	“哦，是的，圣人先生，我知道时间很晚了，但你会原谅我的！
It is your cock—there is something the matter.	是你的公鸡——出问题了。
It is like the basket.	就跟那只篮子一样。
Look!’	你看！”
‘THAT my cock?	“那真是我的公鸡吗？
THAT my basket?	那真是我的篮子吗？
Somebody has played you a trick, my good man!’	你被人捉弄了，我的朋友！”
‘A trick?’ repeated Father Grumbler, who began to understand what had happened.	“被捉弄了？”牢骚父亲重复道，他开始明白是怎么一回事了。
‘Then it must have been those two—’	“那么肯定就是那两个——”
‘I warned you not to show them to anybody,’ said the Holy Man.	“我提醒过你不要把这些东西给任何人看。”圣人说道，
‘You deserve—but I will give you one more chance.’	“你活该——但我会再给你一次机会。”
 And, turning, he unhooked something from the wall.	说完，他转身从墙上的钩子上取下一样东西。
‘When you wish to dust your own jacket or those of your friends,’ he said, ‘you have only got to say, “Flack, flick, switch, be quick,” and you will see what happens.	“如果你想替自己或你的朋友掸去夹克上的灰尘，”他说，“你只需说：‘拍，打，抽，快。’你就会看到发生的一切。
That is all I have to tell you.’	这就是我必须要告诉你的全部。”
 And, smiling to himself, the Holy Man pushed Father Grumbler out of the cave.	说完，圣人暗自笑了笑，把牢骚父亲推出了山洞。
‘Ah, I understand now,’ muttered the good man, as he took the road home; ‘but I think I have got you two rascals!’ and he hurried on to the tavern with his basket under his arm, and the cock and the switch both inside.	“啊，我现在明白了，”他走在回家的路上，喃喃自语地说道，“但我想我要让你们两个无赖好看！”于是他急忙赶到酒馆，胳膊上挎着他的篮子，里面装着公鸡和鞭子。
‘Good evening, friends!’ he said, as he entered the inn.	“晚上好，朋友们！”他边说边走进客栈，
‘I am very hungry, and should be glad if you would roast this cock for me as soon as possible.	“我饿极了，如果你们能尽快把这公鸡烤给我吃，我会很高兴的。
THIS cock and no other—mind what I say,’ he went on.	就是这只公鸡，不要别的鸡——注意我说的话。”他继续说道，
‘Oh, and another thing!	“哦，还有另外一件事！
You can light the fire with this basket.	你们可以用这个篮子生火。
When you have done that I will show you something I have in my bag,’ and, as he spoke, he tried to imitate the smile that the Holy Man had given HIM.	等你们把这些做完，我会让你们看我包里的一样东西。”他一边说着，一边试图模仿圣人对他的那种微笑。
These directions made the innkeeper’s wife very uneasy.	这些要求让客栈老板的妻子很不自在。
However, she said nothing, and began to roast the cock, while her husband did his best to make the man sleepy with wine, but all in vain.	不过，她没说什么，开始烤那只公鸡，此时她丈夫正竭力用酒灌他，好让他有睡意，但一切都是徒劳。
After dinner, which he did not eat without grumbling, for the cock was very tough, the man struck his hand on the table, and said: ‘Now listen to me.	牢骚父亲一边吃一边骂骂咧咧，因为鸡烤得太硬，嚼也嚼不动。吃完饭后，牢骚父亲一拳打在桌子上，而后说：“现在听我说。
Go and fetch my cock and my basket, at once.	去把我的公鸡和我的篮子取来给我，马上。
Do you hear?’	听见没有？”
‘Your cock, and your basket, Father Grumbler?	“你的公鸡，还有你的篮子，牢骚父亲？
But you have just—’	可你刚刚已经——”
‘MY cock and MY basket!’ interrupted he.	“我的公鸡和我的篮子！”他打断了他们说的话，说道，
‘And, if you are too deaf and too stupid to understand what that means, I have got something which may help to teach you.’	“另外，如果你们又聋又傻听不懂我的话，那么我有样东西可以用来教教你们。”
 And opening the bag, he cried: ‘Flack, flick, switch, be quick.’	然后他打开包，喊道：“拍，打，抽，快。”
And flack! flick! like lightening a white switch sprang out of the bag, and gave such hearty blows to the innkeeper and his wife, and to Father Grumbler into the bargain, that they all jumped as high as feathers when a mattress is shaken.	于是劈啪一声，一根白色鞭子闪电般从那包里跳出来，狠狠向客栈老板和他的妻子抽去，就连牢骚父亲也不放过，他们全被打得跳了起来，就和摇动床垫时飞起的羽毛一样高。
‘Stop! stop! make it stop, and you shall have back your cock and basket,’ cried the man and his wife.	“停！停！让它停下，你可以拿回你的公鸡和篮子。”那对夫妇大声说道。
And Father Grumbler, who had no wish to go on, called out between his hops: ‘Stop then, can’t you?	牢骚父亲也不想再继续挨打了，他边跳边喊：“那就停吧，好吗？
That is enough for to-day!’	今天的就到此为止了！”
But the switch paid no attention, and dealt out its blows as before, and MIGHT have been dealing them to this day, if the Holy Man had not heard their cries and come to the rescue.	但那鞭子不听，继续打，要不是圣人听到他们的呼喊声赶来解救的话，他们今天可能还在挨打。
‘Into the bag, quick!’ said he, and the switch obeyed.	“到包里去，快！”他说道，鞭子便照做了。
‘Now go and fetch me the cock and the basket,’ and the woman went without a word, and placed them on the table.	“现在去把我的公鸡和篮子拿来给我。”圣人命令道。老板娘没说一句话就去了，拿来后把它们放在了桌子上。
‘You have all got what you deserved,’ continued the Holy Man, ‘and I have no pity for any of you.	“你们全都罪有应得，”圣人继续说，“而且我不同情你们中的任何一个人。
I shall take my treasures home, and perhaps some day I may find a man who knows how to make the best of the chances that are given to him.	我要把我的宝物带回家，或许有一天，我会找到一个懂得如何充分利用所得到的机会的人。
