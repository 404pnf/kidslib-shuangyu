The Faithful Bull	忠贞的公牛	
by Ernest Hemingway	作者：欧内斯特·海明威	
One time there was a bull and his name was not Ferdinand and he cared nothing for flowers.	从前有一头公牛，它的名字不叫费迪南德，它对什么鲜花都不喜欢。	译者注：“Ferdinand”引用美国动画片《公牛费迪南德》的翻译名。
He loved to fight and he fought with all the other bulls of his own age, or any age, and he was a champion.	它酷爱搏斗，跟其他所有与自己同龄或任何年龄的牛都斗，并且它总是能赢。	
His horns were as solid as wood and they were as sharply pointed as the quill of a porcupine.	它的角像木头一样结实，像豪猪身上的刺一样尖利。	
They hurt him, at the base, when he fought and he did not care at all.	一旦斗起来，其他牛顶得它的角根生疼，它却毫不在意。	
His neck muscles lifted in a great lump that is called in Spanish the morillo and this morillolifted like a hill when he was ready to fight.	它的脖颈上隆起一大块肌肉，在西班牙语中，这叫“莫里略”；当它准备搏斗时，它的“莫里略”便拱得像一座小山似的。	
He was always ready to fight and his coat was black and shining and his eyes were clear.	它随时准备搏斗，它的皮毛乌黑而光亮，目光明净。	
Anything made him want to fight and he would fight with deadly seriousness exactly as some people eat or read or go to church.	一旦有什么事激起它搏斗的欲望，它便会极其认真地搏斗，就像一些人吃饭、读书、做礼拜一样认真。	
Each time he fought he fought to kill and the other bulls were not afraid of him because they came of good blood and were not afraid.	每次搏斗，它都要置对方于死地，其他的牛倒也不怕它，因为它们都是良种牛，是不会害怕的。	
But they had no wish to provoke him.	但是它们并不想去激怒它。	
Nor did they wish to fight him.	也不想同它斗。	
He was not a bully nor was he wicked, but he liked to fight as men might like to sing or to be the King or the President.	它并不蛮横霸道，也不爱使坏心眼，可它就是喜欢斗，就像人可能喜欢唱歌，或是想当国王、总统一样。	
He never thought at all.	它从来都不思考。	
Fighting was his obligation and his duty and his joy.	搏斗是它的天职、它的本分和乐趣。	
He fought on the stony, high ground.	在多石的高地上，它斗。	
He fought under the cork-oak trees and he fought in the good pasture by the river.	在栓皮栎下和河边丰茂的草地上，它也斗。	
He walked fifteen miles each day from the river to the high, stony ground and he would fight any bull that looked at him.	它每天从河边走十五英里到多石的高地上。有哪头牛敢看它一眼，它就要找哪头牛斗。	
Still he was never angry.	尽管如此，它从来也不发火。	
That is not really true, for he was angry inside himself.	这其实也没说对，因为它的心里还是愤怒的。	
But he did not know why, because he could not think.	但是它自己也不知道为什么会愤怒，因为它不会思考。	
He was very noble and he loved to fight.	它血统高贵，生性爱斗。	
So what happened to him?	那么它后来怎么样了？	
The man who owned him, if anyone can own such an animal, knew what a great bull he was and still he was worried because this bull cost him so much money by fighting with other bulls.	它的主人（假如这样的牛也有个主人的话）知道它是一头了不起的好牛，不过还是觉得很伤脑筋，因为这牛老是跟别的牛斗，斗掉他非常多的钱。	
Each bull was worth over one thousand dollars and after they had fought the great bull they were worth less than two hundred dollars and sometimes less than that.	一头牛本来值一千多美元，不过跟这头好牛斗过之后，就值不了两百美元了，有时甚至会更少。	
So the man, who was a good man, decided that he would keep the blood of this bull in all of his stock rather than send him to the ring to be killed.	它的主人是个好人，他决定把这头牛的血统留在自己的牛群里，而不是把它送到斗牛场上去挨杀。	
So he selected him for breeding.	于是他挑选这头牛来配种。	
But this bull was a strange bull.	可是这头牛也真是头怪牛。	
When they first turned him into the pasture with the breeding cows, he saw one who was young and beautiful and slimmer and better muscled and shinier and more lovely than all the others.	他们第一次把这头牛赶到牧场里跟待配种的母牛呆在一起，它就看上了一头年轻俏丽的母牛。这头母牛比所有其他的母牛都要苗条，肌肉更发达，皮毛更有光泽，也更可爱。	
So, since he could not fight, he fell in love with her and he paid no attention to any of the others.	既然不能斗，它就爱上了这头母牛，对其他的母牛一眼也不瞧。	
He only wanted to be with her, and the others meant nothing to him at all.	它只想跟她呆在一起，对其他的母牛根本不屑一顾。	
The man who owned the bull ranch hoped that the bull would change, or learn, or be different than he was.	养牛的牧场主本来还希望这头牛会有所转变，开点儿窍，哪怕是和以前相比有一点儿不同也好。	
But the bull was the same and he loved whom he loved and no one else.	但是这头牛依然不变，它就只爱自己爱的那头母牛，心无旁骛。	
He only wanted to be with her, and the others meant nothing to him at all.	它只想跟她在一起，对其他的母牛根本不屑一顾。	
So the man sent him away with five other bulls to be killed in the ring, and at least the bull could fight, even though he was faithful.	正因如此，它的主人把它和另外五头公牛一起送到斗牛场去挨杀。尽管它对母牛忠贞不二，在斗牛场上它还是有两下子的。	
He fought wonderfully and everyone admired him and the man who killed him admired him the most.	它搏斗得很精彩，所有的人都钦佩它，最钦佩它的还要数那个杀了它的人。	
But the fighting jacket of the man who killed him and who is called the matador was wet through by the end, and his mouth was very dry.	杀它的那个人（大家都叫它“斗牛士”）穿的战衣到最后都湿透了，嘴巴也干得厉害。	
“Que toro más bravo,” the matador said as he handed his sword to his sword handler.	“这头牛真是勇敢极了。”斗牛士边说边把剑递给自己的助手。	
He handed it with the hilt up and the blade dripping with the blood from the heart of the brave bull who no longer had any problems of any kind and was being dragged out of the ring by four horses.	他递剑的时候剑柄朝着上方，剑锋上还滴着从这头勇敢的公牛心脏里流出的鲜血。这头牛不会再遇到任何困难了，此刻它正被四匹马拖出场外。	
“Yes.	“是啊。	
He was the one the Marqués of Villamayor had to get rid of because he was faithful,” the sword handler, who knew everything, said.	它就是比利亚马约侯爵想要打发掉的那头牛，因为它对一头母牛忠贞不渝。”那个无所不知的助手说道。	
“Perhaps we should all be faithful.” the matador said.	“也许我们都应该像它一样忠贞不渝。”斗牛士说。
