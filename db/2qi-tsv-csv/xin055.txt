"The Greater Coney","大科尼岛"
"by O. Henry ","作者：欧·亨利"
"“Next Sunday,” said Dennis Carnahan, “I’ll be after going down to see the new Coney Island that’s risen like a phoenix bird from the ashes of the old resort.","“下周日，”丹尼斯·卡纳汉说，“我打算去看看新科尼岛，它像一只凤凰，从旧游乐场的灰烬中重生了。"
"I’m going with Norah Flynn, and we’ll fall victims to all the dry goods deceptions, from the red-flannel eruption of Mount Vesuvius to the pink silk ribbons on the race-suicide problems in the incubator kiosk.”","我要和诺拉·弗林一起去，所有纺织品做的模型总是蒙骗我们：从用红色法兰绒做的维苏威火山爆发，到用粉色丝带做成的展示种族自杀问题的婴儿保育箱。”","译者注：种族自杀（race-suicide）是指人口出生率控制过低，从而造成一个种族的逐渐消亡。"
"Was I there before?","你问我以前去过那里吗？"
"I was.","是的，我去过。"
"I was there last Tuesday.","上星期二我就在那里。"
"Did I see the sights?","问我参观了吗？"
"I did not.","没有。"
"Last Monday I amalgamated myself with the Bricklayers’ Union, and in accordance with the rules I was ordered to quit work the same day on account of a sympathy strike with the Lady Salmon Canners’ Lodge No.2, of Tacoma, Washington.","上周一，我加入了砌砖工人协会，但因为参加了声援华盛顿塔科马罐头女工第二支部的罢工，按照规定我当天就被炒了鱿鱼。"
"Twas disturbed I was in mind and proclivities by losing me job, bein’ already harassed in me soul on account of havin’ quarrelled with Norah Flynn a week before by reason of hard words spoken at the Dairymen and Street-Sprinkler Drivers’ semi-annual ball, caused by jealousy and prickly heat and that divil, Andy Coghlin.","丢了工作让我心里很不好受，而且上周在牛奶工和洒水车工半年一次的舞会上，因为妒忌和燥热，还有安迪·科格林那个混蛋的缘故，我同诺拉·弗林吵了一架，心里更加难过。"
"So, I says, it will be Coney for Tuesday; and if the chutes and the short change and the green-corn silk between the teeth don’t create diversions and get me feeling better, then I don’t know at all.","所以，我说周二去科尼岛，如果那里的滑道、骗局和塞牙的玉米须之类的游乐项目，都不能让我分分心，使我感觉好转的话，我就真不知道该怎么办了。"
"Ye will have heard that Coney has received moral reconstruction.","你可能听说了，科尼岛在道德方面上经历了重建。"
"The old Bowery, where they used to take your tintype by force and give ye knockout drops before having your palm read, is now called the Wall Street of the island.","以前的鲍厄里街上，常有人强行给你照相，或者在看手相之前先给你吃蒙汗药，而现在，那里被称为岛上的华尔街。"
"The wienerwurst stands are required by law to keep a news ticker in ’em; and the doughnuts are examined every four years by a retired steamboat inspector.","法律规定，卖法兰克福香肠的摊位必须配备新闻播报机；每隔四年，就会有退休的轮船监察员来检查炸面包圈的质量。"
"The nigger man’s head that was used by the old patrons to throw baseballs at is now illegal; and, by order of the Police Commissioner the image of a man drivin’ an automobile has been substituted.","以前棒球击打黑人头像的游戏现在是非法的了；并且，根据警察局局长的命令，图像换成了一个驾驶汽车的人像。"
"I hear that the old immoral amusements have been suppressed.","我听说，那些不道德的娱乐项目已经被取缔了。"
"People who used to go down from New York to sit in the sand and dabble in the surf now give up their quarters to squeeze through turnstiles and see imitations of city fires and floods painted on canvas.","以前从纽约来的人或是坐在沙滩上，或是冲浪戏水，而现在他们会花25美分买门票，从旋转栅栏门挤到里面去看绘制在画布上的城市火灾和洪水。"
"The reprehensible and degradin’ resorts that disgraced old Coney are said to be wiped out.","据说老科尼岛上那些受人谴责、伤风败俗的场所已经全部被取缔了。"
"The wipin’-out process consists of raisin’ the price from 10 cents to 25 cents, and hirin’ a blonde named Maudie to sell tickets instead of Micky, the Bowery Bite.","取缔的步骤包括把票价从10美分提高到25美分，雇佣了一个名叫莫蒂的金发女郎来代替鲍厄里街叫米基的那个刺儿头。"
"That’s what they say—I don’t know.","人们是这么说的——我不清楚。"
"But to Coney I goes a-Tuesday.","但是星期二我去了科尼岛。"
"I gets off the ‘L’ and starts for the glitterin’ show.","从高架铁路一下来，我就直奔灯光璀璨的表演。"
"’Twas a fine sight.","演出确实精彩。"
"The Babylonian towers and the Hindoo roof gardens was blazin’ with thousands of electric lights, and the streets was thick with people.","成千上万的电灯把巴比伦塔和印度屋顶花园照得亮如白昼，街上人山人海。"
"’Tis a true thing they say that Coney levels all rank.","人们说科尼岛上人人平等，这是真的。"
"I see millionaires eatin’ popcorn and trampin’ along with the crowd; and I see eight-dollar-a-week clothin’-store clerks in red automobiles fightin’ one another for who’d squeeze the horn when they come to a corner.","我看见百万富翁吃着爆米花在人群中闲逛，我看见周薪八美元的服装店售货员开着红车在拐弯处互不相让，使劲按喇叭。"
"“‘I made a mistake,’” I says to myself.","“‘我错了。’我暗忖道。"
"Twas not Coney I needed.","我需要的不是科尼岛。"
"When a man’s sad ’tis not scenes of hilarity he wants.","对于一个伤心的人来说，他要的不是欢乐的景象。"
"Twould be far better for him to meditate in a graveyard or to attend services at the Paradise Roof Gardens.","他最好是去墓地冥想，或者到屋顶花园教堂中做礼拜。"
"Tis no consolation when a man’s lost his sweetheart to order hot corn and have the waiter bring him the powdered sugar cruet instead of salt and then conceal himself, or to have Zozookum, the gipsy palmist, tell him that he has three children and to look out for another serious calamity; price twenty-five cents.","失恋的人点一份热玉米，向服务员要糖粉瓶而不是盐瓶，然后躲起来，或者花25美分请那个吉普赛人佐索昆来算命，听他说你命里有三个孩子，提醒你要谨防另一次大灾难。但所有这一切都不会给你带来任何慰藉。"
"I walked far away down on the beach, to the ruins of an old pavilion near one corner of this new private park, Dreamland.","我沿着海滩走了很远，一直走到一个废弃的亭子，它就在这个‘梦幻世界’新游乐场的一角。"
"A year ago that old pavilion was standin’ up straight and the old-style waiters was slammin’ a week’s supply of clam chowder down in front of you for a nickel and callin’ you ‘cully’ friendly, and vice was rampant, and you got back to New York with enough change to take a car at the bridge.","一年前，这个旧亭子还好好地伫立在那里，你付上五分钱，衣着老派的侍者就会把一盘够吃一个星期的蛤肉杂烩“砰”地放在你面前，还会友好地称呼你为“朋友”，诸如此类，等到在桥边等车回纽约时，你还有足够的零钱乘车。"
"Now they tell me that they serve Welsh rabbits on Surf Avenue, and you get the right change back in the movin’-picture joints.","现在听说海浪大街供应的是威尔士干酪，找回来的零钱恰好只够你在小影院看场电影。"
"I sat down at one side of the old pavilion and looked at the surf spreadin’ itself on the beach, and thought about the time me and Norah Flynn sat on that spot last summer.","我坐在破旧的亭子边，望着海滩上的浪花，回忆起去年夏天我和诺拉·弗林就坐在那个地方的情景。"
"’Twas before reform struck the island; and we were happy.","那时岛上还没开始改造，我们很快活。"
"We had tintypes and chowder in the ribald dives, and the Egyptian Sorceress of the Nile told Norah out of her hand, while I was waitin’ in the door, that ’twould be the luck of her to marry a red-headed gossoon with two crooked legs, and I was overrunnin’ with joy on account of the allusion.","我们在举止粗鲁的人群中照了相，吃完杂烩，来自尼罗河的埃及女巫师看了诺拉的手相说，她命中注定要和一个红头发、罗圈腿的小伙子结婚，在门外等候的我听到这些时，不禁为描绘的这个画面欣喜若狂。"
"And ’twas there that Norah Flynn put her two hands in mine a year before and we talked of flats and the things she could cook and the love business that goes with such episodes.","同样是一年前，就是在那里，诺拉·弗林把她的手交到了我的手中，我们谈到公寓，谈到她会做什么吃的，谈到和爱情相关的事情。"
"And that was Coney as we loved it, and as the hand of Satan was upon it, friendly and noisy and your money’s worth, with no fence around the ocean and not too many electric lights to show the sleeve of a black serge coat against a white shirtwaist.","那是我们喜爱的，同时也有撒旦插手的科尼岛，一个友好、喧嚣而又物有所值的地方。海边没有篱笆，电灯也不多，黑哔叽上衣的袖子同白衬衫的对比也不那么扎眼。"
"I sat with my back to the parks where they had the moon and the dreams and the steeples corralled, and longed for the old Coney.","如今新的游乐场把月亮、梦想以及尖塔都围了起来，我背对着它，怀念曾经的科尼岛。"
"There wasn’t many people on the beach.","海滩上少有人来。"
"Lots of them was feedin’ pennies into the slot machines to see the ‘Interrupted Courtship’ in the movin’ pictures; and a good many was takin’ the sea air in the Canals of Venice and some was breathin’ the smoke of the sea battle by actual warships in a tank filled with real water.","许多人往自动售票机中投着硬币，打算看电影《中断的求爱》，许多人领略着威尼斯运河的风情，还有一些人则在一个盛满水的大水池边呼吸着来着真实海战的火药味。"
"A few was down on the sands enjoyin’ the moonlight and the water.","少数人在沙滩上享受月光和海景。"
"And the heart of me was heavy for the new morals of the old island, while the bands behind me played and the sea pounded on the bass drum in front.","然而，老科尼岛的上新道德规范却让我心情沉重，乐队在我身后演奏，大海则在我面前敲打低音鼓。"
"And directly I got up and walked along the old pavilion, and there on the other side of, half in the dark, was a slip of a girl sittin’ on the tumble-down timbers, and unless I’m a liar she was cryin’ by herself there, all alone.","不久我就站起来，绕着旧亭子周围走了走，发现亭子后面的阴影里，有个姑娘坐在坍塌的木柱子上独自哭泣。"
"“‘Is it trouble you are in, now, Miss,’ says I; ‘and what’s to be done about it?’","“‘小姐，你碰到什么麻烦了吗？’我问道，‘需要帮忙吗？’"
"“’Tis none of your business at all, Denny Carnahan,” says she, sittin’ up straight.","‘和你没关系，丹尼·卡纳汉。’那姑娘直起身来答道。"
"And it was the voice of no other than Norah Flynn.","说话的不是别人，竟然是诺拉·弗林。"
"“Then it’s not,” says I, “and we’re after having a pleasant evening, Miss Flynn.","‘没有就好，弗林小姐，’我说，‘我们度过了一个愉快的晚上。"
"Have ye seen the sights of this new Coney Island, then?","那么，这个新科尼岛的景色你都看了吗？"
"I presume ye have come here for that purpose,"" says I.","我估计你就是为了这个来的吧。’我说。"
"“I have,” says she.","‘我都看了。’她说，"
"“Me mother and Uncle Tim they are waiting beyond.","‘我妈妈和蒂姆叔叔在那边等我呢。"
"’Tis an elegant evening I’ve had.","我今晚玩得很高兴，"
"I’ve seen all the attractions that be.""","好看的地方我都看了。’"
"“Right ye are,” says I to Norah; and I don’t know when I’ve been that amused.","‘那就好。’我对诺拉说道，与此同时，我也感到前所未有的开心。"
"After disportin’ me-self among the most laughable moral improvements of the revised shell games I took meself to the shore for the benefit of the cool air.","我看完了改版以后最可笑的仙人摘豆戏法，接着又来这边海滩来呼吸凉爽的空气。"
"“And did ye observe the Durbar, Miss Flynn?”","‘你注意到杜巴了吗，弗林小姐？’"
"“I did,”says she, reflectin’; “but ’tis not safe, I’m thinkin’, to ride down them slantin’ things into the water.”","‘我注意到了，’她思考了一下回答道，‘但是我觉得，从滑道直接滑下去冲进水里不太安全。’"
"“How did ye fancy the shoot the chutes?”I asks.","‘你喜欢从那个滑道上冲下去吗？’我问道。"
"“True, then, I’m afraid of guns,”says Norah.","‘说实话，我怕打枪，’诺拉说，"
"“They make such noise in my ears.","‘声音太大了，震得耳朵嗡嗡响。"
"But Uncle Tim, he shot them, he did, and won cigars.","可是蒂姆叔叔喜欢玩，他打了枪，还赢了雪茄。"
"’Tis a fine time we had this day, Mr. Carnahan.”","我们今天玩得很开心，卡纳汉先生。’"
"“I’m glad you’ve enjoyed yerself,” I says.","‘你玩得开心，我真高兴。’我回答道，"
"“I suppose you’ve had a roarin’ fine time seein’ the sights.","‘我猜你在那些景点玩得很愉快。"
"And how did the incubators and the helter-skelter and the midgets suit the taste of ye?”","你觉得那个保育箱、螺旋滑梯和侏儒对你的胃口吗？’"
"“I—I wasn’t hungry,’ says Norah, faint.","‘我——我不饿。’诺拉有气无力地说‘"
"“But mother ate a quantity of all of ’em.","‘但是妈妈各种东西都吃了好多。"
"I’m that pleased with the fine things in the new Coney Island,’ says she, ‘that it’s the happiest day I’ve seen in a long time, at all.”","新科尼岛的好东西让我感到高兴，’她说，‘这是我好久以来最开心的一天。’"
"“Did you see Venice?”says I.","‘你看了威尼斯了吗？’我问道。"
"“We did,” says she.","‘我们看了，’她回答，"
"‘She was a beauty.","‘她是个美人儿。"
"She was all dressed in red, she was, with—’","她一身红衣服，她——’"
"I listened no more to Norah Flynn.","我不再听诺拉·弗林胡扯了。"
"I stepped up and I gathered her in my arms.","我走上前去，把她搂在了怀里。"
"“’Tis a story-teller ye are, Norah Flynn’, says I.","‘你真会撒谎，诺拉·弗林，’我说道，"
"“Ye’ve seen no more of the greater Coney Island than I have meself.","‘你看到的新科尼岛一点也不比我看到的多。"
"Come, now, tell the truth—ye came to sit by the old pavilion by the waves where you sat last summer and made Dennis Carnahan a happy man.","来吧，跟我说实话，你来这里是为了到这座海边的老亭子坐坐，而去年夏天正是你在这里让丹尼斯·卡纳汉成了幸福的人。"
"Speak up, and tell the truth.”","来吧，告诉我真相。’"
"Norah stuck her nose against me vest.","诺拉把头埋进了我怀里。"
"“I despise it, Denny,”she says, half cryin’.","‘我才不爱看那些景点呢，丹尼，’她就快要哭了‘"
"“Mother and Uncle Tim went to see the shows, but I came down here to think of you.","’妈妈和蒂姆叔叔去看表演了，但我来这里是为了回忆你我的往事。"
"I couldn’t bear the lights and the crowd.","那些灯光和人群让我无法忍受。"
"Are you forgivin’ me, Denny, for the words we had?”","你能原谅我么？原谅我说过的那些不该说的话？‘"
"“Twas me fault,”says I.","‘那是我的错，’我说，"
"“I came here for the same reason meself.","‘我来这里的目的和你一样。"
"Look at the lights, Norah,” I says, turning my back to the sea—“ain’t they pretty?”","你瞧那些灯光，诺拉，’我转过身，背对着大海说，‘它们不是很美吗？’"
"“They are,” says Norah, with her eyes shinin’; “and do ye hear the bands playin?”","‘确实很美，’诺拉眼睛一亮，‘你听到乐队的演奏了吗？"
"Oh, Denny, I think I’d like to see it all.’","哦，丹尼，我想到处去看看。’"
"“The old Coney is gone, darlin’,” I says to her.","‘曾经的科尼岛已经不复存在了，亲爱的。’我对她说，"
"“Everything moves.","‘一切都在变化。"
