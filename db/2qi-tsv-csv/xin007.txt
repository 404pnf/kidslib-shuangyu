"by Guy de Maupassant","作者：莫泊桑"
"The noon sun poured fiercely down upon the fields.","正午的太阳炙烤着大地。"
"They stretched in undulating folds between the clumps of trees that marked each farmhouse; the different crops, ripe rye and yellowing wheat, pale-green oats, dark-green clover, spread a vast striped cloak, soft and rippling, over the naked body of the earth.","高低起伏的庄稼地分布在绿树成阴的农舍之间：成熟的黑麦、正在转黄的小麦、浅绿的燕麦以及暗绿的苜蓿，像一件带有条纹的外衣一样伸展蔓延开来，在土地裸露的身体上缓缓地随风起伏。"
"In the distance, on the crest of a slope, was an endless line of cows, ranked like soldiers, some lying down, others standing, their large eyes blinking in the burning light, chewing the cud and grazing on a field of clover as broad as a lake.","在远处坡地的高脊上，是一排望不到头的牛群。它们像士兵一样排列着，有的躺着，有的站着。它们的大眼睛眨呀眨的，在阳光下闪着光亮。它们边咀嚼着反刍的食物，边凝望着如湖水般宽阔的苜蓿覆盖的田地。"
"Two women, mother and daughter, were walking with a swinging step, one behind the other, towards this regiment of cattle.","这时，有两个女人，母女俩，迈着蹒跚的步子走着，一个在前，一个在后，朝着这群牛走去。"
"Each carried two zinc pails, slung outwards from the body on a hoop from a cask; at each step the metal sent out a dazzling white flash under the sun that struck full upon it.","她们每人提着两个锌皮桶，用一个大桶箍把桶和她们隔开，免得擦到身上。在阳光的照耀下，她们每走一步，这些金属制品就发出耀眼的白色光芒。"
"The women did not speak.","两个女人谁都没有说话。"
"They were on their way to milk the cows.","她们是在去挤牛奶的路上。"
"When they arrive, they set down one of their pails and approach the first two cows, making them stand up with a kick in the ribs from wooden-shod feet.","她们到达那里后，便放下其中一只桶，走向前面排头的两头牛，用木头鞋踢它们的肋骨，想让它们站起身来。"
"The beast rises slowly, first on its forelegs, then with more difficulty raises its large hind quarters, which seem to be weighted down by the enormous udder of livid pendulous flesh.","牛缓缓地站起来。先站起前腿，然后费力地把它肥大的屁股抬起来，看起来好像被垂下的庞大的青灰色乳房压得太重了。"
"The two Malivoires, mother and daughter, kneeling beneath the animal’s belly, tug with a swift movement of their hands at the swollen teat, which at each squeeze sends a slender jet of milk into the pail.","马利瓦尔家的这对母女，跪在奶牛的肚子下面，双手快速地上下挤奶牛胀鼓鼓的乳房，每挤一次，就有一道细细的奶汁射进桶里。"
"The yellowish froth mounts to the brim, and the women go from cow to cow until they reach the end of the long line.","淡黄色的奶汁不断向桶的边缘上升。她们一头一头地挤着，直至这一长排的尽头。"
"As soon as they finish milking a beast, they change its position, giving it a fresh patch of grass on which to graze.","每当挤完一头奶牛，她们就将这头奶牛牵开，让它到另一块鲜嫩的草地上去吃草。"
"Then they start on their way home, more slowly now, weighed down by the load of milk, the mother in front, the daughter behind.","然后，她们就踏上回家的旅途，提着沉重的牛奶，比来时步子更慢了。母亲走在前面，女儿跟在后面。"
"Abruptly the latter halts, sets down her burden, sits down, and begins to cry.","突然，女儿停住脚步，放下手头的牛奶桶，坐在地上哭起来。"
"Madame Malivoire, missing the sound of steps behind her, turns round and is quite amazed.","这时，马利瓦尔夫人听不到后面的脚步声了，回头一看，感到很是奇怪。"
"“What’s the matter with you?” she said.","“你怎么啦？”她问道。"
"Her daughter Celeste, a tall girl with flaming red hair and flaming cheeks, flecked with freckles as though sparks of fire had fallen upon her face one day as she worked in the sun, murmurs, moaning softly, like a beaten child:","她的女儿塞莱斯特个子很高，长着一头火红的头发，她通红的面颊上有点点雀斑，就像是她某天在大太阳下干活时，洒落在脸上的点点火星一样。她像刚挨过打的小孩一样，低声抽噎着说；"
"“I can’t carry the milk any further.”","“我再也提不动这桶牛奶了。”"
"Her mother looked at her suspiciously.","那个做母亲的用疑惑的眼光看着她。"
"“What’s the matter with you?” she repeated.","“你到底怎么啦？”她重复问道。"
"“It drags too heavy, I can’t,” replied Celeste, who had collapsed and was lying on the ground between the two pails, hiding her eyes in her apron.","塞莱斯特累坏了，在两桶牛奶之间躺下来，用围裙遮住脸，说道：“它太重了，我不行了。”"
"“What’s the matter with you, then?” said her mother for the third time.","“你到底是怎么了？”她母亲第三次问道。"
"The girl moaned:","女孩这时哼哼唧唧地说："
"“I think there’s a baby on the way.” ","“我想我怀孕了。”"
"And she broke into sobs.","接着，她抽泣起来。"
"The old woman now in her turn set down her load, so amazed that she could find nothing to say.","这回轮到老妇人放下奶桶了，她惊讶得一句话都说不出来。"
"At last she stammered:","终于，她结结巴巴地说道："
"“You ... you ... you’re going to have a baby, you clod! How can that be?”","“你……你……你怀孕了，你这个不知廉耻的家伙！怎么会这样？”"
"The Malivoires were prosperous farmers, wealthy and of a certain position, widely respected, good business folk, of some importance in the district.","马利瓦尔这家人是有钱的农场主，富有、庄重、深受尊敬。他们是好的生意合作伙伴，在区里有着很重要的地位。"
"“I think I am, all the same,” faltered Celeste.","“我怕多半是，就是那么回事。”塞莱斯特支支吾吾地说道。"
"The frightened mother looked at the weeping girl grovelling at her feet.","惊呆了的母亲看着躺在她面前满脸是泪的女儿。"
"After a few seconds she cried:","几秒钟过后，她哭叫道："
"“You’re going to have a baby! ","“你怀孕了！"
"A baby! ","你有孩子了！"
"Where did you get it, you slut?”","你哪儿弄来的？你这个贱货！”"
"Celeste, shaken with emotion, murmured:","塞莱斯特害怕地颤抖着，低声说道："
"“I think it was in Polyte’s coach.”","“我想是在波利特的马车里。”"
"The old woman tried to understand, tried to imagine, to realise who could have brought this misfortune upon her daughter.","这个老妇人设法想弄明白、想猜出来、想要知道，到底是谁让她的女儿遭此不幸。"
"If the lad was well off and of decent position, an arrangement might be come to.","如果对方是个体面有钱的人，那就有可能安排一桩婚事。"
"The damage could still be repaired.","那么，残局就还可以得到修补。"
"Celeste was not the first to be in the same way, but it was annoying all the same, seeing their position and the way people talked.","塞莱斯特并不是头一个遇上这类事的，但是考虑到流言蜚语和她们家的地位，这件事总归叫人不愉快。"
"“And who was it, you slut?” she repeated.","她又问道：“那又是谁给你弄上的？浪货！”"
"Celeste, resolved to make a clean breast of it, stammered:","塞莱斯特，下定决心全盘托出，结结巴巴地说道："
"“I think it was Polyte.”","“我想，是波利特。”"
"At that Madame Malivoire, mad with rage, rushed upon her daughter and began to beat her with such fury that her hat fell off in the effort.","这时，马利瓦尔夫人真是气疯了，她扑到女儿身上，用尽全身力量狂暴地捶打她女儿，以至于帽子都震掉了。"
"With great blows of the fist she struck her on the head, on the back, all over her body; Celeste, prostrate between the two pails, which afforded her some slight protection, shielded just her face with her hands.","重重的拳头落在她的头上、背上，落在全身。塞莱斯特直直地躺在那两个略微能挡住她一点儿的桶子之间，只有双手捂着脸。"
"All the cows, disturbed, had stopped grazing and turned round, staring with their great eyes.","所有的奶牛都受惊了，停止了吃草，转过头来，睁大眼睛望着她们。"
"The last one mooed, stretching out its muzzle towards the women.","最近的那头牛伸长鼻子对着这两个女人哞哞地叫了起来。"
"After beating her daughter till she was out of breath, Madame Malivoire stopped, exhausted; her spirits reviving a little, she tried to get a thorough understanding of the situation.","一直打到气都透不过来了，马利瓦尔夫人才喘着气停了下来，她已经筋疲力尽。她重新定了定神，想让自己完全掌握情况。"
"“—Polyte! Lord save us, it’s not possible! ","“——波利特！天哪，怎么可能！"
"How could you, with a carrier? ","你怎么能和一个马车夫搞到一起？"
"You must have lost your wits.","你就一点儿脑子都没有？"
"He must have played you a trick, the good-for-nothing!”","他只是在耍你，你这个没出息的！”"
"Celeste, still prostrate, murmured in the dust:","塞莱斯特，仍旧直直地躺在地上，在尘土中低声说；"
"“I didn’t pay my fare!”","“我没有付车钱。”"
"And the old Norman woman understood.","那个诺曼老妇人一下子全明白了。"
"Every week, on Wednesday and on Saturday, Celeste went to town with the farm produce, poultry, cream, and eggs.","每周的星期三、星期六，塞莱斯特就将庄里的农产品送到集上去，有家禽、奶油和鸡蛋。"
"She started at seven with her two huge baskets on her arm, the dairy produce in one, the chickens in the other, and went to the main road to wait for the coach to Yvetot.","早上七点，她便用胳膊挽着两只大篮子，一只里装着奶制品，另一只装着家禽，走到大路上去等到伊夫托的邮车。"
"She set down her wares and sat in the ditch, while the chickens with their short pointed beaks and the ducks with their broad flat bills thrust their heads between the wicker bars and looked about them with their round, stupid, surprised eyes.","她将东西放在地上，自己坐在沟渠边上。那些嘴又短又尖的母鸡和嘴又长又平的鸭子从柳筐里探出头来，用它们圆溜溜的眼睛，傻乎乎地惊奇地张望着。"
"Soon the bus, a sort of yellow box with a black leather cap on the top, came up, jerking and quivering with the trotting of the old white horse.","不一会儿，一辆破破烂烂的、顶着个黑色顶篷的黄色车厢的马车到了，车屁股和着那匹白色驽马的步伐摇摇晃晃。"
"Polyte the coachman, a big, jolly fellow, stout though still young, and so burnt up by sun and wind, soaked by rain, and coloured with brandy that his face and neck were brick-red, cracked his whip and shouted from the distance:","车夫波利特，是个快活的大块头单身汉，虽然还年轻，但是肚皮已经凸出来了。由于受到风吹、日晒、雨淋的侵袭，再加上酒精的渲染，他的脖子和脸都成了砖红色。他老远就响着鞭子叫道："
"“Morning, Mam’selle Celeste.","“早上好，塞莱斯特小姐。"
"In good health, I hope?”","近来还好吧，我想？”"
"She gave him her baskets, one after the other, which he stowed in the boot; then she got in, lifting her leg high up to reach the step, and exposing a sturdy leg clad in a blue stocking.","她将篮子一个一个地递给他，他把它们放在车顶的格子里；然后，她高高地抬起腿来，踩上车子的脚踏板，同时，露出了穿着蓝色长袜子的粗壮的腿肚子。"
"Every time Polyte repeated the same joke: “Well, it’s not got any thinner.”","每次，波利特都重复一样的笑话：“好哇，没有变瘦。”"
"She laughed, thinking this funny.","于是她笑笑，觉得这话很好玩。"
"Then he uttered a “Gee up, old girl!” which started off the thin horse.","接着，他吆喝一声：“吁，走咯！”于是，他那条瘦马又上了路。"
"Then Celeste, reaching for her purse in the depths of her pocket, slowly took out fivepence, threepence for herself and twopence for the baskets, and handed them to Polyte over his shoulder.","这时，塞莱斯特将手伸进口袋里，慢慢地从里面掏出五个铜板，其中三个当她的车费，另两个做篮子的车费，从肩头上递给了波利特。"
"He took them, saying:","他一边接过钱，一边说道："
"“Aren’t we going to have our little bit of sport to-day?”","“那么今天还是不能开开心？”"
"And he laughed heartily, turning round towards her so as to stare at her at his ease.","接着，他开怀大笑起来，转过头来对着她，好看个痛快。"
"She found it a big expense, the half-franc for a journey of two miles.","两公里路就得花上半个法郎，她觉得太贵了。"
"And when she had no coppers she felt it still more keenly; it was hard to make up her mind to part with a silver coin.","尤其当她没有铜板时，就更是觉得心痛，下不了决心掏出那个银币。"
"One day, as she was paying, she asked:","有一天，她在付钱的时候问道："
"“From a good customer like me you oughtn’t to take more than threepence.”","“像我这样好的熟主顾，您是不是最多只该收三个铜子儿呢？”"
"He burst out laughing.","他大笑起来。"
"“Threepence, my beauty; why, you’re worth more than that.”","“三个铜子儿，我的美人；说句老实话，您比这可值钱多了。”"
"She insisted on the point.","她仍然说道；"
"“But you make a good two francs a month out of me.”","“就这样每月也得给您两法郎。”"
"He whipped up his horse and exclaimed:","他一边抽着马一边喊道："
"“Look here, I’m an obliging fellow! ","“瞧，我可是很好说话的！"
"We’ll call it quits for a bit of sport.”","只要能让我开一次心，我就免了您的费。”"
"“What do you mean?” she asked with an air of innocence.","她天真地问道：“您说的是什么事儿呀？”"
"He was so amused that he laughed till he coughed.","他被逗得快活极了，笑得都呛住了。"
"“A bit of sport is a bit of sport, damn it; a game for a lad and a lass, a dance for two without music.”","“开一回心就是开一回心，老天爷！一男一女一起跳舞，不带音乐。”"
"She understood, blushed, and declared:","她懂了，红着脸说道："
"“I don’t care for that sort of game, Monsieur Polyte.”","“我是不开这种玩笑的，波利特先生。”"
"But he was in no way abashed, and repeated, with growing merriment:","可是他一点儿都不觉得尴尬，反而越说越起劲："
"“You’ll come to it some day, my beauty, a bit of sport for a lad and a lass!”","“您将来会参加的，我的美人，那种一男一女的游戏！”"
"And since that day he had taken to asking her, each time that she paid her fare:","而且从此以后，每次她付钱给他时，他就养成了习惯般地问道："
"“Aren’t we going to have our bit of sport to-day?”","“今天还是不能开开心？”"
"She, too, joked about it by this time, and replied:","现在，她也拿这开玩笑，回答道："
"“Not to-day, Monsieur Polyte, but Saturday, for certain!”","“今天不行，波利特先生，但是，礼拜六，准行！”"
"And amid peals of laughter he answered:","于是他笑着喊道："
"“Saturday, then, my beauty.”","“礼拜六，讲定了啊，我的美人。”"
"But inwardly she calculated that, during the two years the affair had been going on, she had paid Polyte forty-eight whole francs, and in the country forty-eight francs is not a sum which can be picked up on the roadside; she also calculated that in two more years she would have paid nearly a hundred francs.","但是她心里偷偷盘算着，从这情况开始的两年以来，她付了波利特整整四十八法郎，而在乡下，要挣四十八法郎可不是那么容易的事。她还算出来，要是像这样下去，再过两年，她会付出一百法郎。"
"To such purpose she meditated that, one spring day as they jogged on alone, when he made his customary inquiry: ","出于这样的盘算，在一个春天的日子里，只有他俩时，他照习惯问道："
"“Aren’t we going to have our bit of sport yet?” ","“今天还是不能开开心？”"
"She replied:","她回答说："
"“Yes, if you like, Monsieur Polyte.”","“听您的，波利特先生。”"
"He was not at all surprised, and clambered over the back of his seat, murmuring with a complacent air:","他一点儿都不觉得吃惊，而是跨过了后面的条凳，用一副满意的神气低声说道："
"“Come along, then.","“来吧。"
"I knew you’d come to it some day.”","我早就知道，您会这样的。”"
"The old white horse trotted so gently that she seemed to be dancing upon the same spot, deaf to the voice which cried at intervals, from the depths of the vehicle: “Gee up, old girl! Gee up, then!”","而那匹老马呢，开始用慢慢的小步跑，简直像在原地跳舞，根本听不见从车厢深处偶尔传出的吆喝声：“吁，驾！吁，驾！”"
"Three months later Celeste discovered that she was going to have a child.","三个月过后，塞莱斯特发现自己怀孕了。"
"All this she had told her mother in a tearful voice.","她哭哭啼啼地把这些全部告诉了她妈妈。"
"Pale with fury, the old woman asked:","那个老妇人，气得脸色发白地问道："
"“Well, what did it cost?”","“那么，这合多少钱呢？”"
"“Four months; that makes eight francs, doesn’t it?” replied Celeste.","塞莱斯特回答道：“四个月，自然是八个法郎。”"
"At that the peasant woman’s fury was utterly unleashed, and, falling once more upon her daughter, she beat her a second time until she was out of breath.","这时，那个乡下妇人真是气坏了，她又扑到女儿身上，使劲打她，直至喘不过气来。"
"Then she rose and said:","然后，她站起来问道："
"“Have you told him about the baby?”","“你对他说过怀孕的事吗？”"
"“No, of course not.”","“没有，当然没有。”"
"“Why haven’t you told him?”","“那你怎么不告诉他呢？”"
"“Because very likely he’d have made me pay for all the free rides!”","“因为他很有可能会要我补上所有的钱！”"
"The old woman pondered awhile, then picked up her milkpails.","于是，那个老妇人想了一会儿，提起桶来说："
"“Come on, get up, and try to walk home,” she said, and, after a pause, continued:","“走吧，起来，尽力走回家去。”而后，沉默了一会儿，太又说，"
"“And don’t tell him as long as he doesn’t notice anything, and we’ll make six or eight months’ fares out of him.”","“什么也别跟他说，只要不让他察觉，我们好好地再赚六个月或者八个月。”"
"And Celeste, who had risen, still crying, dishevelled and swollen round the eyes, started off again with dragging steps, murmuring:","塞莱斯特披头散发地站起来，眼睛都哭肿了，她一边拖着沉重的步子走着，一边喃喃地说道："
"“Of course I won’t say.”","“我肯定不会说。”"
