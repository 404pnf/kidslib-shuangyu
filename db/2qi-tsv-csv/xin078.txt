"by O. Henry","作者：欧·亨利"
"Miss Posie Carrington had earned her success.","波希·卡林顿小姐获得了成功。"
"She began life handicapped by the family name of “Boggs,” in the small town known as Cranberry Corners.","她出生在那个叫做克兰伯里角的小镇，从来到这个世界的那一刻起，她就为“博格斯”这个家族姓氏所困扰。"
"At the age of eighteen she had acquired the name of “Carrington” and a position in the chorus of a metropolitan burlesque company.","十八岁的时候，她改姓“卡林顿”，并在都市一家滑稽戏表演剧团的歌舞队里找到了工作。"
"Thence upward she had ascended by the legitimate and delectable steps of “broiler,” member of the famous “Dickey-bird” octette, in the successful musical comedy, “Fudge and Fellows,” leader of the potato-bug dance in “Fol-de-Rol,” and at length to the part of the maid “’Toinette” in “The King’s Bath-Robe,” which captured the critics and gave her her chance.","此后她顺风顺水，轻松愉快地在演艺之路上步步高升：她是著名的“小鸟”八重唱组合成员之一，出演了大获成功的音乐喜剧《扯淡和伙伴》，担任《废话》土豆甲虫舞的领舞，最后在《国王的浴衣》那出戏里出演侍女“图瓦内特”一角。《国王的浴衣》获得了评论界的好评，也给了她成名的机会。"
"And when we come to consider Miss Carrington she is in the heydey of flattery, fame and fizz; and that astute manager, Herr Timothy Goldstein, has her signature to iron-clad papers that she will star the coming season in Dyde Rich’s new play, “Paresis by Gaslight.”","当我们谈论卡林顿小姐的时候，她正声名鹊起、大红大紫；那个精明的经理蒂莫西·戈尔茨坦先生和她签下了合同，她将在下一季主演戴德·里奇的新剧《迷醉华灯下》 。"
"Promptly there came to Herr Timothy a capable twentieth-century young character actor by the name of Highsmith, who besought engagement as “Sol Haytosser,” the comic and chief male character part in “Paresis by Gaslight.”","很快，有一个叫海史密斯的20世纪的青年实力派性格演员来找蒂莫西先生，恳请担任“索尔·海托塞”一角，也就是喜剧《迷醉华灯下》里的男主角。"
"“My boy,” said Goldstein, “take the part if you can get it.","“老弟，”戈尔茨坦说，“如果你能搞得定，这个角色就归你。"
"Miss Carrington won’t listen to any of my suggestions.","卡林顿小姐不会听从我的任何建议。"
"She has turned down half a dozen of the best imitators of the rural dub in the city.","她已经回绝了本市五六个演乡巴佬演得最好的演员。"
"She declares she won’t set a foot on the stage unless ‘Haytosser’ is the best that can be raked up.","她声称，只有网罗到最好的‘海托塞’，她才肯登台。"
"She was raised in a village, you know, and when a Broadway orchid sticks a straw in his hair and tries to call himself a clover blossom she’s on, all right.","你知道她是在乡村里长大的。百老汇的兰花在头上插根稻草，就想把自己说成是苜蓿，这可诓不了她。"
"I asked her, in a sarcastic vein, if she thought Denman Thompson would make any kind of a show in the part.","我曾有点儿半讽刺地问过她，依她看来，登曼·汤普森能否胜任这个角色。"
"‘Oh, no,’ says she.","‘噢，不，’她这么回答，"
"‘I don’t want him or John Drew or Jim Corbett or any of these swell actors that don’t know a turnip from a turnstile.","‘我不要他，也不要约翰·德鲁或者吉姆·科比特，这些连萝卜缨和小白菜都分不清的大演员一个也不行。"
"I want the real article.’","我要货真价实的家伙。’"
"So, my boy, if you want to play ‘Sol Haytosser’ you will have to convince Miss Carrington.","所以，孩子，如果你想扮演索尔·海托塞，首先得说服卡林顿小姐。"
"Luck be with you.”","祝你好运。”"
"Highsmith took the train the next day for Cranberry Corners.","第二天，海史密斯乘火车去了克兰伯里角。"
"He remained in that forsaken and inanimate village three days.","他在那个死气沉沉的偏僻小镇上呆了三天。"
"He found the Boggs family and corkscrewed their history unto the third and fourth generation.","他找到了博格斯家，把他们家祖辈和曾祖辈的那点儿历史都给打听出来了。　"
"He amassed the facts and the local color of Cranberry Corners.","他收集了有关克兰伯里角的故事和风土人情。"
"The village had not grown as rapidly as had Miss Carrington.","小镇的发展速度赶不上卡林顿小姐的走红速度。"
"The actor estimated that it had suffered as few actual changes since the departure of its solitary follower of Thespis as had a stage upon which “four years is supposed to have elapsed.”","海史密斯估计，自从镇上唯一的泰斯庇斯门徒离开之后，小镇就压根没什么变化，正如舞台上“一晃过了四年”而实际上却没发生什么一样。"
"He absorbed Cranberry Corners and returned to the city of chameleon changes.","他吸收了克兰伯里角的一切，然后回到了那个千变万化的城市。"
"It was in the rathskeller that Highsmith made the hit of his histrionic career.","海史密斯在那个地下餐馆里迎来了他演艺生涯最辉煌的时刻。"
"There is no need to name the place; there is but one rathskeller where you could hope to find Miss Posie Carrington after a performance of “The King’s Bath-Robe.”","我们无需提及餐馆的名字。只有在这家餐馆里，你才能指望碰到出演了一场《国王的浴衣》之后的波希·卡林顿小姐。"
"There was a jolly small party at one of the tables that drew many eyes.","他们占据了一张桌子，有说有笑，十分热闹，格外引人注目。"
"Miss Carrington, petite, marvellous, bubbling, electric, fame-drunken, shall be named first.","首先要介绍的就是大红大紫的卡林顿小姐，她娇小可爱，丰满迷人，活力四射。"
"Herr Goldstein follows, sonorous, curly-haired, heavy, a trifle anxious, as some bear that had caught, somehow, a butterfly in his claws.","其次是戈尔茨坦先生，他是个大块头，嗓门很大，一头卷发，看样子有烦心事，神情就像是用爪子笨笨地抓住了一只蝴蝶的憨熊那样。"
"Next, a man condemned to a newspaper, sad, courted, armed, analyzing for press agent’s dross every sentence that was poured over him, eating his à la Newburg in the silence of greatness.","接下来是个郁郁不得志的记者，神情沮丧，貌似常被人追打而警觉的样子。他一边沉默地、自以为了不起地吃着纽伯格菜，一边分析抛向他的每一句话，留作日后新闻的谈资。"
"To conclude, a youth with parted hair, a name that is ochre to red journals and gold on the back of a supper check.","最后一个是梳分头的年轻人，他的名字对小报和餐馆账单来说相当于金钱。"
"These sat at a table while the musicians played, while waiters moved in the mazy performance of their duties with their backs toward all who desired their service, and all was bizarre and merry because it was nine feet below the level of the sidewalk.","这几个人占了一张桌子。餐馆里的乐师在演奏，侍者来来往往地表演着他们令人眼花缭乱的服务技巧，但留给需要他们服务的顾客的永远是背影。所有人都有种奇异和快乐的感觉，因为他们呆在离人行道地面九英尺深的地下。"
"At 11.45 a being entered the rathskeller.","差一刻12点时，一个人走进了地下餐馆。"
"The first violin perceptibly flatted a C that should have been natural; the clarionet blew a bubble instead of a grace note; Miss Carrington giggled and the youth with parted hair swallowed an olive seed.","第一小提琴手把本来是C调的地方拉低了半个音；吹单簧管的也把装饰音吹走了调；卡林顿小姐咯咯一笑；梳分头的年轻人囫囵吞下一颗橄榄仁。"
"Exquisitely and irreproachably rural was the new entry.","刚进来的人带着一股毋庸置疑又无可非难的乡土气息。"
"A lank, disconcerted, hesitating young man it was, flaxen-haired, gaping of mouth, awkward, stricken to misery by the lights and company.","他是个不安而犹豫的年轻人，瘦高身材，一头淡黄色的头发，张着嘴，笨头笨脑的。餐厅里的灯光和人群令他有些局促不安。"
"His clothing was butternut, with bright blue tie, showing four inches of bony wrist and white-socked ankle.","他穿着胡桃色的制服，打了鲜亮的蓝领带，骨瘦如柴的手腕和白袜子包裹的脚踝露出来四英寸。"
"He upset a chair, sat in another one, curled a foot around a table leg and cringed at the approach of a waiter.","他带翻了张椅子，在另一张上坐下来，脚蜷勾着一个桌角。侍者走了过来，他却有些怕怕的。"
"“You may fetch me a glass of lager beer,” he said, in response to the discreet questioning of the servitor.","“那麻烦您给我来杯淡啤酒吧。”面对侍者周到的询问，他回答道。"
"The eyes of the rathskeller were upon him.","餐馆里的目光一下都聚集到他身上。"
"He was as fresh as a collard and as ingenuous as a hay rake.","他像芥蓝那样质朴，又像搂草机那样朴实。"
"He let his eye rove about the place as one who regards, big-eyed, hogs in the potato patch.","他睁大眼睛四处打量着，就像看到了一群猪闯进了自家的土豆地里一样。"

"He rose and went to her table with a lateral, shining smile and a blush of pleased trepidation.","年轻人咧开嘴笑了，一脸的灿烂，高兴而窘迫地红着脸站起来，朝她坐的桌子走去。"

"“Don’t ye remember me—Bill Summers—the Summerses that lived back of the blacksmith shop?","“你还记得我吗——比尔·萨默斯——铁匠铺后面的萨默斯家？"
"I reckon I’ve growed up some since ye left Cranberry Corners.","我得说自从你离开克兰伯里角后，我长大了些。"
"“’Liza Perry ’lowed I might see ye in the city while I was here.","“莉莎·佩里说我进城的时候可能会见到你。"
"You know ’Liza married Benny Stanfield, and she says—”","你知道莉莎嫁给了本尼·斯坦菲尔德，她说——”"
"“Ah, say!” interrupted Miss Carrington, brightly, “Lize Perry is never married—what!","“啊，什么！”卡林顿小姐来了兴致，打断道，“莉莎·佩里不可能结婚的——不可能啊！"
"Oh, the freckles of her!”","她的雀斑呐！”"
"“Married in June,” grinned the gossip, “and livin’ in the old Tatum Place.","“六月结的婚，”八卦的年轻人咧嘴一乐，“现在住在塔特姆老院子里。"
"Ham Riley perfessed religion; old Mrs. Blithers sold her place to Cap’n Spooner; the youngest Waters girl run away with a music teacher; the court-house burned up last March; your uncle Wiley was elected constable; Matilda Hoskins died from runnin’ a needle in her hand, and Tom Beedle is courtin’ Sallie Lathrop—they say he don’t miss a night but what he’s settin’ on their porch.”","哈姆·赖利信教了；老太太布利塞斯把宅子卖给了斯普纳船长；沃特斯家的小女儿跟一个音乐老师跑了；三月份的一场火把法院大楼给烧喽；你叔叔威利当上了警长；玛蒂尔达·霍斯金斯死了，是因为手被根针扎了一下；汤姆·比德尔在追萨莉·莱斯罗普——他们说汤姆每晚都坐在萨利家的门口。”"
"“The wall-eyed thing!” exclaimed Miss Carrington, with asperity.","“那个斜眼的家伙！”卡林顿小姐愤恨地叫道，"
"“Why, Tom Beedle once—say, you folks, excuse me a while—this is an old friend of mine—Mr.—what was it?","“哼！汤姆·比德尔以前不是——哎，诸位，失陪一会儿——这是我的一位老朋友——是——你叫什么来着？"
"Yes, Mr. Summers—Mr. Goldstein, Mr. Ricketts, Mr.—Oh, what’s yours?","对了，萨默斯先生——这位是戈尔茨坦先生，里基茨先生——嗯，你是？"
"‘Johnny’’ll do—come on over here and tell me some more.”","就叫你‘约翰尼’好了——上这边来，再多跟我聊聊。”"
"She swept him to an isolated table in a corner.","她把他拖到僻静角落里的一张桌子旁。"
"Herr Goldstein shrugged his fat shoulders and beckoned to the waiter.","戈尔茨坦先生耸了耸胖实的肩膀，招呼侍者过来。"
"The newspaper man brightened a little and mentioned absinthe.","报社记者的兴致好了些，要了杯苦艾酒。"
"The youth with parted hair was plunged into melancholy.","梳分头的年轻人突然郁闷起来。"
"The guests of the rathskeller laughed, clinked glasses and enjoyed the comedy that Posie Carrington was treating them to after her regular performance.","餐馆里的顾客们开怀畅饮，频频碰杯，欣赏着波希·卡林顿小姐在正式演出后招待他们的喜剧秀。"
"A few cynical ones whispered “press agent” and smiled wisely.","几个玩世不恭的人边自得地笑着，边耳语道“纯属炒作”。"
"Posie Carrington laid her dimpled and desirable chin upon her hands, and forgot her audience—a faculty that had won her laurels for her.","波希·卡林顿双手托着她那长着酒窝的漂亮脸颊，一点儿也不在意观众——为她赢得赞誉的正是这份本领。"
"“I don’t seem to recollect any Bill Summers,” she said, thoughtfully gazing straight into the innocent blue eyes of the rustic young man.","“我想不起来有谁叫比尔·萨默斯，”她边说边仔细打量起年轻的乡村小伙那双纯朴的蓝眼睛，"
"“But I know the Summerses, all right.","“不过，我还是知道萨默斯家的。"
"I guess there ain’t many changes in the old town.","我猜老家没什么变化吧。"
"You see any of my folks lately?”","最近你见过我的家人没？”"
"And then Highsmith played his trump.","于是海史密斯使出了他的杀手锏。"
"The part of “Sol Haytosser” called for pathos as well as comedy.","“索尔·海托塞”一角除了能够表演喜剧之外，还需要会煽情。"
"Miss Carrington should see that he could do that as well.","应该让卡林顿小姐看到他在这个方面也能胜任。"
"“Miss Posie,” said “Bill Summers,” “I was up to your folkeses house jist two or three days ago.","“波希小姐，”比尔·萨默斯说，“两三天前，我还去了趟你家。"
"No, there ain’t many changes to speak of.","嗯，没什么变化好说的。"
"The lilac bush by the kitchen window is over a foot higher, and the elm in the front yard died and had to be cut down.","厨房窗户下的那丛紫丁香长到一英尺多高了，前院那棵榆树死了，不得不砍掉。"
"And yet it don’t seem the same place that it used to be.”","和以前相比，还是有点儿不同。”"

"Your ma asked me to set down.","你母亲叫我坐下。"
"‘Don’t touch that willow rocker, William,’ says she.","‘别碰那张柳条椅，威廉,’她说,"

"‘William,’ says she, ‘when I get sot down and lookin’ down the road, I can’t bear to move.","‘威廉，’她说，‘我一坐下来看见这条路，就动不了了。"
"Never a day,’ says she, ‘but what I set here every minute that I can spare and watch over them palin’s for Posie.","每天如此，’她说，‘有空就在这儿坐着，瞅着，等着波希。"
"She went away down that road in the night, for we seen her little shoe tracks in the dust, and somethin’ tells me she’ll come back that way ag’in when she’s weary of the world and begins to think about her old mother.’","她是晚上从这条路上走的，因为第二天我们在路上看到了她的小脚印。我有种感觉，当她厌倦了外面的世界，想起她老妈的时候，还会从那条路上回来的。’"
"“When I was comin’ away,” concluded “Bill,” “I pulled this off’n the bush by the front steps.","“我离开的时候，”“比尔”最后说道，“在门前台阶那儿的灌木丛里把这个摘了下来。"
"I thought maybe I might see you in the city, and I knowed you’d like somethin’ from the old home.”","我估计到了城里兴许能见到你，我知道你会喜欢老家的东西。”"
"He took from his coat pocket a rose—a drooping, yellow, velvet, odorous rose, that hung its head in the foul atmosphere of that tainted rathskeller like a virgin bowing before the hot breath of the lions in a Roman arena.","他从上衣口袋里掏出一朵黄玫瑰——芬芳柔美，有着天鹅绒般的光泽。它在地下餐馆污浊的空气中低垂着花蕾，宛如一个少女在古罗马竞技场上狮群热乎乎的呼吸面前，含胸垂首一样。"
"Miss Carrington’s penetrating but musical laugh rose above the orchestra’s rendering of “Bluebells.”","卡林顿小姐悦耳的笑声穿透了乐队演奏的《风信子》的旋律。"

"She thrust the yellow rose into the bosom of her wonderful, dainty, silken garments, stood up and nodded imperiously at Herr Goldstein.","她把那朵黄玫瑰戳在她华美绸衣的前襟里，站起身，高傲地朝戈尔茨坦先生点点头。"
"Her three companions and “Bill Summers” attended her to her cab.","刚才陪同她的三个人和“比尔·萨默斯”一起送她上了马车。"
