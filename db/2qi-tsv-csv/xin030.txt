"by William Somerset Maugham","作者：威廉·萨默赛特·毛姆"
"It was quite a small party, because our hostess liked general conversation; we never sat down to dinner more than eight, and generally only six, and after dinner when we went up to the drawing-room the chairs were so arranged that it was impossible for two persons to go into a huddle in a corner and so break things up.","这是一个很小的聚会，因为我们的女主人喜欢大家一起聊天。一起吃晚饭的人通常只有六个，从不超过八个。晚饭后我们前往会客厅，在那里，椅子的摆放方式不会让任何两个人有机会躲到角落里窃窃私语，从而打破一起谈话的氛围。"
"I was glad on arriving to find that I knew everyone.","抵达之后，我发现这里的每个人我都认识，这让我很高兴。"
"There were two nice clever women besides our hostess and two men besides myself.","我们的女主人身边坐着两位聪明漂亮的女士，而我的身边则是两位男士。"
"One was my friend Ned Preston.","其中一个是我的朋友内德·普雷斯顿。"
"Our hostess made it a point never to ask wives with their husbands, because she said each cramped the other’s style and if they didn’t like to come separately they needn’t come at all.","我们的女主人坚决要求妻子和丈夫不要一起来参加聚会，因为她说夫妻双方会压抑彼此的个性，如果他们不愿意单独来参加聚会，倒不如干脆别来。"
"But since her food and her wine were good and the talk almost always entertaining they generally came.","但是由于她提供的食物和酒都很美味，谈话也几乎总是令人愉快，因此大家通常还是愿意来。"
"People sometimes accused her of asking husbands more often than wives, but she defended herself by saying that she couldn’t possibly help it because more men were husbands than women were wives.","人们有时候会指责她，说她邀请已婚男士的次数比邀请太太们的要多，但她辩解说这是没有办法的事，因为成了家的男人比成了家的女人要多。"
"Ned Preston was a Scot, a good-humoured, merry soul, with a gift for telling a story, sometimes too lengthily, for he was uncommonly loquacious, but with dramatic intensity.","内德·普雷斯顿是苏格兰人，为人风趣快活，很有讲故事的天分，但他过于喋喋不休，讲的故事有时候过于冗长了些，但都很有感染力。"
"He was a bachelor with a small income which sufficed for his modest needs, and in this he was lucky since he suffered from that form of chronic tuberculosis which may last for years without killing you, but which prevents you from working for your living.","他是个单身汉，收入不多，却也能满足基本的生活所需。在这一点上，他还算幸运，因为他患有一种慢性肺结核病，这种可能多年不愈的病虽然不会致人死命，却让人无法做事谋生。"
"Now and then he would be ill enough to stay in bed for two or three weeks, but then he would get better and be as gay, cheerful, and talkative as ever.","他时不时会病倒在床上两三个礼拜，之后就会好起来，还和以前一样快活健谈。"
"I doubt whether he had enough money to live in an expensive sanatorium and he certainly hadn’t the temperament to suit himself to its life.","我怀疑他可能住不起昂贵的疗养院。当然，他的脾性也适应不了疗养院的生活。"
"He was worldly.","他是个世俗之人。"
"When he was well he liked to go out, out to lunch, out to dinner, and he liked to sit up late into the night smoking his pipe and drinking a good deal of whisky.","他身体好的时候喜欢出门，出去吃午饭或者吃晚饭。他还喜欢熬夜抽烟斗，喝很多威士忌。"
"If he had been content to live the life of an invalid he might have been alive now, but he wasn’t; and who can blame him?","如果他甘愿作为一个病人生活，那现在可能还活着，但是事实并非如此，而谁又能责备他呢？"
"He died at the age of fifty-five of a haemorrhage which he had one night after coming home from some house where, he may well have flattered himself, he was the success of the party.","他55岁时死于大出血，当天晚上他从某个聚会回家，很有可能还自我吹嘘了一番，成了聚会上的明星人物。"
"He had that febrile vitality that some consumptives have, and was always looking for an occupation to satisfy his desire for activity.","像其他结核病患者一样，他总是精力充沛，并且不断寻求能满足自己好动性情的职业。"
"I don’t know how he heard that at Wormwood Scrubs they were in want of prison visitors, but the idea took his fancy so he went to the Home Office and saw the official in charge of prisons to offer his services.","他不知怎么听说了沃姆伍德·斯克拉比斯监狱需要志愿者，这引起了他的兴趣，于是他跑到内政部，见了专管监狱的官员，并提出要干这份差事。"
"The job is unpaid, and though a number of persons are willing to undertake it, either from compassion or curiosity, they are apt to grow tired of it, or find it takes up too much time, and the prisoners whose problems, interests and future they have been concerned with are left somewhat in the lurch.","这份工作没有报酬，尽管很多人出于同情或好奇干了这份工作，但往往不久就由于厌烦，或是感到占用的时间太多，开始打退堂鼓。他们曾经关心的囚犯以及这些人所面临的问题、利益和未来，都被抛到了脑后。"
"The Home Office people consequently are wary of taking on anyone who does not look as if he would persevere, and they make careful inquiries into the applicant’s antecedents, character, and general suitability.","因此，内政部的官员们不会招募那些看起来不能坚持干下去的人，并会仔细询问申请人的经历、性格和适应能力。"
"Then he is given a trial, is discreetly watched, and if the impression is unfavourable is politely thanked and told that his services are no longer required.","之后他们会对申请人进行试用，并仔细观察。如果印象不佳，他们会很有礼貌地谢绝对方，告诉他们不用再继续工作了。"
"But Ned Preston satisfied the dour and shrewd official who interviewed him that he was in every way reliable, and from the beginning he got on well with the governor, the warders, and the prisoners.","但是内德·普雷斯顿却使面试他的那位脸色阴郁、精明强干的官员非常满意。他认为内德非常可靠，而且打从一开始，内德就与监狱长、看守和囚犯们相处得很好。"
"He was entirely lacking in class-consciousness, so prisoners, whatever their station in life, felt at ease with him.","他完全没有等级观念，因此囚犯们无论处于怎样的社会地位，与内德相处时都感到非常自在。"
"He neither preached nor moralized.","他既不劝诫，也不说教。"
"He had never done a criminal, or even a mean, thing in his life, but he treated the crime of the prisoners he had to deal with as though it were an illness like his own tuberculosis which was a nuisance you had to put up with, but which it did no good to talk about.","他一生中从没犯过罪，甚至也没有做过卑劣的事情，但是他对待自己所负责的囚犯们的罪行就像对待自己的结核病一样，把它们当成是不得不忍受的烦心事，但是过多地谈论它们也没什么好处。"
"Wormwood Scrubs is a first offenders’ prison and it is a building, grim and cold, of forbidding appearance.","沃姆伍德·斯克拉比斯监狱里关的都是初次犯罪的人。那是一个晦暗又寒冷的地方，看了令人心生畏惧。"
"Ned took me over it once and I had goose-flesh as the gates were unlocked for us and we went in.","内德曾带我去过一次，当我们走进一道道打开的大门时，我不禁起了一身鸡皮疙瘩。"
"We passed through the halls in which the men were working.","我们穿过大厅，囚犯们正在那里干活。"
"‘If you see any pals of yours take no notice of them,’ Ned said to me.","“如果你看见自己的朋友，就假装没看见，”内德对我说，"
"‘They don’t like it.’","“他们不喜欢被人认出来。”"
"‘Am I likely to see any pals of mine?’","“难道我可能会遇见什么朋友吗？”"
"I asked drily.","我冷冷地问。"
"‘You never can tell.","“这可说不准。"
"I shouldn’t be surprised if you had had friends who’d passed bad cheques once too often or were caught in a compromising situation in one of the parks.","假如你的什么朋友不止一次使用空头支票，或是在公园里干什么下流勾当被当场抓住，我完全不会吃惊。"
"You’d be surprised how often I run across chaps I’ve met out at dinner.’","你肯定想不到我在这里碰见过多少次在晚宴上见过的人。”"
"One of Ned’s duties was to see prisoners through the first difficult days of their confinement.","内德的任务之一就是照顾那些刚被关进来的、觉得日子难熬的囚犯。"
"They were often badly shaken by their trial and sentence; and when, after the preliminary proceedings they had to go through on entering the jail, the stripping, the bath, the medical examination and the questioning, the getting into prison clothes, they were led into a cell and locked up, they were apt to break down.","他们常常因为审讯和宣判而受到很大的刺激。在经历入狱必经的最初程序后，其中包括脱去衣服、洗澡、体检、盘问、换上囚衣，他们会被带进一间牢房锁起来，这样一来，他们几乎都要垮掉了。"
"Sometimes they cried hysterically; sometimes they could neither eat nor sleep.","有时候他们会歇斯底里地哭喊，有时候则吃不下饭也睡不着觉。"
"Ned’s business then was to cheer them, and his breezy manner, his natural kindliness, often worked wonders.","内德的任务就是让他们振作起来。他那轻松活泼的态度和与生俱来的亲切感常常会产生意想不到的效果。"
"If they were anxious about their wives and children he would go to see them and if they were destitute provide them with money.","如果囚犯们为老婆孩子担心，他就会亲自去看他们；如果他们穷困潦倒，他还会掏钱出来帮助他们。"
"He brought them news so that they might get over the awful feeling that they were shut away from the common interests of their fellow-men.","他会给犯人们带来各种新闻，使他们免受与有共同兴趣的同伴被隔离的痛苦。"
"He read the sporting papers to be able to tell them what horse had won an important race or whether the champion had won his fight.","他给犯人们读体育报纸，告诉他们哪匹马在一场重要比赛中获胜，或是某位冠军是否赢了比赛。"
"He would advise them about their future, and when the time approached for their release see what jobs they were fitted for and then persuade employers to give them a chance to make good.","他还给犯人们提供未来的建议，当释放日期临近时，他会为他们找合适的工作，并劝说雇主给他们改过自新的机会。"
"Since everyone is interested in crime it was inevitable that sooner or later, with Ned there, the conversation should turn upon it.","由于大家都对犯罪方面的事情感兴趣，因此只要内德在场，话题迟早会转到这方面来。"
"It was after dinner and we were sitting comfortably in the drawing-room with drinks in our hands.","那天晚饭后，我们每人手中拿着一杯酒，舒舒服服地坐在客厅里。"
"‘Had any interesting cases at the Scrubs lately, Ned?’","“最近斯克拉比斯监狱有什么有趣的案子吗，内德？”"
"I asked him.","我问他。"
"‘No, nothing much.’","“没有，没什么有趣的。”"
"He had a high, rasping voice and his laugh was a raucous cackle.","他的嗓门又高，声音又刺耳，笑起来咯咯作响，非常洪亮。"
"He broke into it now.","现在他就是这么笑的。"
"‘I went to see an old girl today who was a packet of fun.","“我今天去见了一个女人，她可真有意思。"
"Her husband’s a burglar.","她的丈夫是个窃贼。"
"The police have known about him for years, but they’ve never been able to get him till just now.","警察盯了他好几年，但是直到最近才抓到他。"
"Before he did a job he and his wife concocted an alibi, and though he’s been arrested three or four times and sent up for trial, the police have never been able to break it and he’s always got off.","每次作案之前，他都会和妻子编好一套证词，因此尽管被抓住了三四次，还被送上法庭审判，警方却始终不能找出证词里的破绽，只好把他放走。"
"Well, he was arrested again a little while ago, but he wasn’t upset, the alibi he and his wife had made up was perfect and he expected to be acquitted as he’d been before.","不久之前他又被抓了，但他毫不沮丧，因为他和妻子编造的不在场的证明非常完美，他觉得自己肯定会跟以前一样被释放。"
"His wife went into the witness-box and to his utter amazement she didn’t give the alibi and he was convicted.","令他大吃一惊的是，他的妻子走上证人席时，并没有说出事先准备的证词，结果他被判有罪。"
"I went to see him.","我去看了看他。"
"He wasn’t so much worried at being in gaol as puzzled by his wife not having spoken up, and he asked me to go and see her and ask what the game was.","他并没有因为坐牢而忧心忡忡，倒是被妻子的反常之举弄懵了。他让我去看看他妻子，问问她到底在搞什么名堂。"
"Well I went, and d’you know what she said to me?","于是我就去了，你猜她对我说什么？"
"She said: “Well, sir, it’s like this; it was such a beautiful alibi I just couldn’t bear to waste it.”’","她说：‘先生，事情是这样的，这个不在场的证明实在是太妙了，我不忍心就这么把它浪费掉。’”"
"Of course we all laughed.","我们自然是哄堂大笑。"
"The story-teller likes an appreciative audience, and Ned Preston was never disinclined to hold the floor.","讲故事的人就喜欢懂得欣赏的听众，内德·普雷斯顿绝不会到此为止。"
"He narrated two or three more anecdotes.","他接着又讲了两三件趣事。"
"They tended to prove a point he was fond of making, that in what till we all got democratic in England were called the lower orders there was more passion, more romance, more disregard of consequences than could ever be found in the well-to-do and presumably educated classes, whom prudence has made timid and convention inhibited.","他讲的这些故事都用以证明他经常津津乐道的一个观点：英国人普遍得到民主之前，所谓的下层阶级总是有更多的热情、更多的传奇故事、更少的顾虑；而那些富裕的或是所谓有教养的阶级却总是小心谨慎、循规蹈矩。"
"‘Because the working man doesn’t read much,’ he said, ‘because he has no great gift for expressing himself, you think he has no imagination.","“由于工人阶级读书少，”他说，“由于他们不善于表达，你就以为他们缺乏想象力。"
"You’re wrong.","你错了。"
"He’s extravagantly imaginative.","他们非常富于想象力。"
"Because he’s a great husky brute you think he has no nerves.","别因为他们长得五大三粗，你就以为他们不敏感。"
"You’re wrong again.","你又错了。"
"He’s a bundle of nerves.’","他们非常敏感。”"
"Then he told us a story which I shall tell as best I can in my own words.","接着他又讲了一个故事，我会尽量用自己的话把它讲好。"
"Fred Manson was a good-looking fellow, tall, well-made, with blue eyes, good features, and a friendly, agreeable smile, but what made him remarkable so that people turned round in the streets to stare at him was that he had a thick head of hair, with a great wave in it, of a deep rich red.","弗雷德·曼森是个漂亮的小伙子，身材魁梧、匀称，一对湛蓝的眼睛，俊秀的面孔上总是挂着友善亲切的微笑。但最令他与众不同的却是那一头浓密的、波浪形的深红色头发，走在街上人们总会忍不住转身盯着他看。"
"It was really a great beauty.","这头发真是美极了。"
"Perhaps it was this that gave him so sensual a look.","或许正是这头秀发为他增添了一股魅力。"
"His maleness was like a heady perfume.","他身上散发着一种令人心醉的男性魅力。"
"His eyebrows were thick, only a little lighter that his hair, and he was lucky enough not to have the ugly skin that so disfigures red-heads.","他的眉毛很浓密，只比头发稀疏一点儿。幸运的是，他不会因为皮肤的丑陋而使那一头红发黯然失色。"
"His was a smooth olive.","他有着光滑的橄榄色皮肤。"
"His eyes were bold, and when he smiled or laughed, which in the healthy vitality of his youth he did constantly, his expression was wonderfully alluring.","他的眼睛炯炯有神，作为一个健康的、充满活力的年轻人，他常常微笑或是开怀大笑，此时他的表情可谓摄人心魄。"
"He was twenty-two and he gave you the rather pleasant impression of just loving to be alive.","他只有22岁，总能让你觉得朝气蓬勃。"
"It was inevitable that with such looks and above all with that troubling sexuality he should have success with women.","凭着如此外貌，特别是那动人心弦的男性魅力，他必然会受到女性的垂青。"
"He was charming, tender, and passionate, but immensely promiscuous.","他温柔迷人，又充满热情，但是在男女关系方面却有点儿混乱。"
"He was not exactly callous or brazen, he had a kindly nature, but somehow or other he made it quite clear to the objects of his passing fancy that all he wanted was a little bit of fun and it was impossible for him to remain faithful to anyone.","他不算冷酷无情，也不厚颜无耻，而是生性和善。但不知何故，他总是对交往的对象明确表示，他只是想找点儿乐子，不可能对任何人保持忠诚。"
"Fred was a postman.","弗雷德是个邮递员。"
"He worked in Brixton.","他的工作地点在布里克斯顿。"
"It is a densely populated part of London, and has the curious reputation of harbouring more criminals than any other suburb because trams run to it from across the river all night long, so that when a man has done a job of housebreaking in the West End he can be sure of getting home without difficulty.","这里是伦敦的人口密集区，由于比其他郊区窝藏了更多的罪犯而名声不好。由于整晚都有电车从河对岸开往这里，如果一个罪犯在伦敦西区入室盗窃，他完全可以轻松地逃回家来。"
"Fred liked his job.","弗雷德喜欢这份工作。"
"Brixton is a district of innumerable streets lined with little houses inhabited by the people who work in the neighbourhood and also by clerks, shop-assistants, skilled workers of one sort or another whose jobs take them every day across the river.","布里克斯顿地区有许多街道，道路两旁鳞次栉比的小房子里住着在附近工作的人，也包括职员、店员和各类技术工人，他们每天都得过河去上班。"
"He was strong and healthy and it was a pleasure to him to walk from street to street delivering the letters.","弗雷德身体健壮，走街串巷地投递邮件对他来说是种乐趣。"
"Sometimes there would be a postal packet to hand in or a registered letter that had to be signed for, and then he would have the opportunity of seeing people.","有时候会有包裹需要交到收件人手上，或是有挂号信需要签收，这样他就有机会与人们接触。"
"He was a sociable creature.","他是个喜欢社交的人。"
"It was never long before he was well known on whatever round he was assigned to.","不管被派到哪个地区送信，他很快就会跟人们熟识起来。"
"After a time his job was changed.","过了一段时间，他的工作换了。"
"His duty then was to go to the red pillar-boxes into which the letters were put, empty them, and take the contents to the main post-office of the district.","他的职责成了从一个个红色邮筒里取出全部信件，然后把它们送往该地区的邮政总局。"
"His bag would be pretty heavy sometimes by the time he was through, but he was proud of his strength and the weight only made him laugh.","有时取完信后，他的邮包会变得非常重，但是他自恃强壮，这种程度的重量对他来说很轻松。"
"One day he was emptying a box in one of the better streets, a street of semi-detached houses, and had just closed his bag when a girl came running along.","一天，他来到一条较为高档的街上收信。这里的房子都是半独立式的。他取完信刚合上邮包，就见一位姑娘朝他跑了过来。"
"‘Postman,’ she cried, ‘take this letter, will you.","“邮递员，”她喊道，“请把这封信带上。"
"I want it to go by this post most particularly.’","我特地想让这封信赶上这一次投递。”"

"‘I never mind obliging a lady,’ he said, putting down his bag and opening it.","“愿意为小姐效劳。”他说着，放下邮包并且打开。"
"‘I wouldn’t trouble you, only it’s urgent,’ she said as she handed him the letter she had in her hand.","“我本不想麻烦你，但这是封急件。”她把手里的信递给他的时候说。"
"‘Who is it to-a feller?’ he grinned.","“给谁的？一个小伙子？”他咧着嘴笑了。"
"‘None of your business.’","“不关你的事。”"
"‘All right, be haughty.","“好吧，还挺傲气的。"
"But I tell you this, he’s no good.","不过我得告诉你，他这人可不怎么样。"
"Don’t you trust him.’","千万别信他。”"
"‘You’ve got a nerve,’ she said.","“你这人脸皮真厚，”她说，"
"‘So they tell me.’","“别人也这么说。”"
"He took off his cap and ran his hand through his mop of curling red hair.","他摘下帽子，用手拢了拢蓬松的红色卷发。"
"The sight of it made her gasp.","看见他这一头秀发，姑娘不禁一愣。"
"‘Where d’you get your perm?’ she asked with a giggle.","“你在哪里烫的发？”她笑嘻嘻地问。"
"‘I’ll show you one of these days if you like.’","“你要是愿意，我这几天就带你去。”"
"He was looking down at her with his amused eyes, and there was something about him that gave her a funny little feeling in the pit of her stomach.","他低着头，用那双讨人喜欢的眼睛看着她。姑娘觉得，他身上有某种东西奇特地拨动了她的心弦。"
"‘Well, I must be on my way,’ he said.","“我得走了，”他说，"
"‘If I don’t get on with the job pretty damn quick I don’t know what’ll happen to the country.’","“要是我不能麻利点儿干活，真不知道国家会出什么事。”"
"‘I’m not detaining you,’ she said coolly.","“我又没拖住你。”她冷冷地说。"
"‘That’s where you make a mistake,’ he answered.","“你就错在这儿了。”他回答说。"
"He gave her a look that made her heart beat nineteen to the dozen and she felt herself blushing all over.","他望了她一眼。这一眼使她的心怦怦直跳起来，她感觉自己整个脸都涨红了。"
"She turned away and ran back to the house.","她转身跑回了房子里。"
"Fred noticed it was four doors away from the pillar-box.","弗雷德注意到姑娘家与邮箱之间隔了四道门。"
"He had to pass it and as he did so he looked up.","那里是他的必经之路，当他经过时，他抬头看了一眼。"
"He saw the net curtains twitch and knew she was watching.","只见那网状的窗帘动了一动，他知道姑娘在看。"
"He felt pleased with himself.","他觉得非常得意。"
"During the next few days he looked at the house whenever he passed it, but never caught a glimpse of the girl.","接下来的几天，他每次经过那所房子都会看上几眼，但再也没见到那位姑娘。"

"‘Well, I can tell you, can’t I?","“我可以告诉你呀。"
"Fred.","弗雷德。"
