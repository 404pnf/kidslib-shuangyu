"Ulysses and the Dogman","","尤利西斯和狗人","译者注：尤利西斯（Ulysses）是罗马神话中的英雄（希腊神话中的奥德修斯odysseus），以智勇双全著称。"
"by O. Henry","","作者：欧·亨利"
"Do you know the time of the dogmen?","","你了解狗人的活动时间吗？"
"When the forefinger of twilight begins to smudge the clear-drawn lines of the Big City there is inaugurated an hour devoted to one of the most melancholy sights of urban life.","","当黄昏的食指开始把纽约清晰的轮廓涂抹得模糊不清时，在接下来的一小时里，城市生活中最凄迷的景象之一便出现了。"
"Out from the towering flat crags and apartment peaks of the cliff dwellers of New York steals an army of beings that were once men.","","纽约岩洞居民居住在一栋栋高耸得像悬崖峭壁一样的公寓大楼中，一批曾经是人类的生物从那里面悄悄地出来了。"
"Even yet they go upright upon two limbs and retain human form and speech; but you will observe that they are behind animals in progress.","","他们用两肢直立行走，保持着人类的外形和语言，但是你会发现他们的进化滞后于动物。"
"Each of these beings follows a dog, to which he is fastened by an artificial ligament.","","他们每一个人都跟着一条狗，由一条人工韧带与狗连在一起。"
"These men are all victims to Circe.","","这些人都是喀耳刻的牺牲品。"
"Not willingly do they become flunkeys to Fido, bell boys to bull terriers, and toddlers after Towzer.","","他们并不愿意做菲杜狗的仆役、牛头梗狗的门童和吐查狗的随从。"
"Modern Circe, instead of turning them into animals, has kindly left the difference of a six-foot leash between them.","","现代的喀耳刻们大发慈悲，没有把他们变成动物，而是替他们保留了六英尺的拴狗带，从而把他们跟动物区别开。"
"Every one of those dogmen has been either cajoled, bribed, or commanded by his own particular Circe to take the dear household pet out for an airing.","","这些狗人都是在他们各自的喀耳刻的哄骗、贿赂或命令之下，带着各自家养的宝贝宠物出来透气的。"
"By their faces and manner you can tell that the dogmen are bound in a hopeless enchantment.","","从他们的脸色和行为，你能看出狗人已陷入了一种无可救药的痴迷境地。"
"Never will there come even a dog-catcher Ulysses to remove the spell.","","永远也不会有一个捕狗者尤利西斯来解除这个咒语。"
"The faces of some are stonily set.","","有几个人面无表情。"
"They are past the commiseration, the curiosity, or the jeers of their fellow-beings.","","对于同胞的怜悯、好奇和嘲笑，他们早已不在乎了。"
"Years of matrimony, of continuous compulsory canine constitutionals, have made them callous.","","多年的婚姻生活以及一直被迫陪狗做保健散步，已使他们变得麻木了。"
"Others, more recently reduced to the ranks of Rover’s retinue, take their medicine sulkily and fiercely.","","其他那些最近被贬为随狗扈从的人，闷闷不乐地干着这个差事，心情十分烦躁。"
"They play the dog on the end of their line with the pleasure felt by the girl out fishing when she catches a sea-robin on her hook.","","他们牵狗时那副幸灾乐祸的样子就像是外出钓鱼的姑娘钓到一只海鲂鱼似的。"
"They glare at you threateningly if you look at them, as if it would be their delight to let slip the dogs of war.","","假如你多看他们几眼，他们就会用恶狠狠的目光瞪着你，仿佛挺乐意干上一架。"
"These are half-mutinous dogmen, not quite Circe-ized, and you will do well not to kick their charges, should they sniff around your ankles.","","他们是心怀不满的狗人，还没有完全被喀耳刻驯服。如果他们牵的狗在你脚边乱嗅，最好别去踢它们。"
"Others of the tribe do not seem to feel so keenly.","","还有一些狗人似乎不怎么热心。"
"They are mostly unfresh youths, with gold caps and drooping cigarettes, who do not harmonize with their dogs.","","他们大多是有点儿经验的小伙子，头上戴着金色便帽，嘴里叼着烟卷，看上去与他们的狗并不协调。"
"The animals they attend wear satin bows in their collars; and the young men steer them so assiduously that you are tempted to the theory that some personal advantage, contingent upon satisfactory service, waits upon the execution of their duties.","","他们牵的狗脖子上系着缎结。看到他们勤勤恳恳地牵着狗，你会不由想到，他们完成任务后肯定会被论功行赏。"
"The dogs thus personally conducted are of many varieties; but they are one in fatness, in pampered, diseased vileness of temper, in insolent, snarling capriciousness of behaviour.","","这些被人伺候的狗品种各异，但它们都体躯肥胖、娇生惯养、刁钻嚣张、飞扬跋扈、张牙舞爪。"
"They tug at the leash fractiously, they make leisurely nasal inventory of every door step, railing, and post.","","它们倔强地拽着皮带，悠闲地嗅着每一个门阶、栏杆和灯柱。"
"They sit down to rest when they choose; they wheeze like the winner of a Third Avenue beefsteak-eating contest; they blunder clumsily into open cellars and coal holes; they lead the dogmen a merry dance.","","它们可以随心所欲地坐下来歇息。它们呼哧喘气的样子就和第三大道上吃牛排比赛的冠军一样。它们笨头笨脑地跌进地窖或者煤洞里，也会害得狗人疲于奔命。"
"These unfortunate dry nurses of dogdom, the cur cuddlers, mongrel managers, Spitz stalkers, poodle pullers, Skye scrapers, dachshund dandlers, terrier trailers and Pomeranian pushers of the cliff-dwelling Circes follow their charges meekly.","","这些不幸的狗国保姆们依偎着杂种狗，牵着银狐犬，拖着狮子狗，陪着达克斯狗，宠着小猎狗，催促着波美拉尼亚小狗。他们都是岩洞居民喀耳刻的麾下，低声下气地跟随着他们的托管物。"
"The doggies neither fear nor respect them.","","那些狗既不惧怕他们，也不尊重他们。"
"Masters of the house these men whom they hold in leash may be, but they are not masters of them.","","被狗用皮带拖着的人也许是一家之主，但却不是狗的主人。"
"From cosey corner to fire escape, from divan to dumbwaiter, doggy’s snarl easily drives this two-legged being who is commissioned to walk at the other end of his string during his outing.","","这个两条腿的动物被委派了任务，要在外出散步时跟在皮带的另一头。于是，狗吠声便轻而易举地把他从舒适的角落里赶到防火梯上，从沙发上赶到送菜升降机旁。"
"One twilight the dogmen came forth as usual at their Circes’ pleading, guerdon, or crack of the whip.","","一天黄昏，在喀耳刻的威逼利诱之下，狗人们又像往常一样出来了。"
"One among them was a strong man, apparently of too solid virtues for this airy vocation.","","他们中间有一个身强体壮的人，从事这种轻松的职业显然是大材小用。"
"His expression was melancholic, his manner depressed.","","他表情忧郁，意志消沉。"
"He was leashed to a vile white dog, loathsomely fat, fiendishly ill-natured, gloatingly intractable toward his despised conductor.","","拖着他走的是一条邪恶的白狗，它胖得让人厌恶，脾气坏得出奇，性格奸诈、顽固，对它的管理人一脸鄙夷。"
"At a corner nearest to his apartment house the dogman turned down a side street, hoping for fewer witnesses to his ignominy.","","狗人在离他住的公寓房子最近的街角拐了个弯，走进一条小巷，希望少遇到一些人，以免丢脸。"
"The surfeited beast waddled before him, panting with spleen and the labour of motion.","","那个饱食终日的畜生晃晃悠悠地走在他前面，愤恨而又吃力地喘着气。"
"Suddenly the dog stopped.","","突然，狗停住了。"
"A tall, brown, long-coated, wide-brimmed man stood like a Colossus blocking the sidewalk and declaring:","","一个穿着长外衣，戴着宽檐帽，皮肤黝黑的大个子像金刚似地挡住了人行道，嚷道："
"“Well, I’m a son of a gun!”","","“嘿，坏蛋！”"
"“Jim Berry!” breathed the dogman, with exclamation points in his voice.","","“吉姆·贝里！”狗人惊讶地失声叫道。"
"“Sam Telfair,” cried Wide-Brim again, “you ding-basted old willy-walloo, give us your hoof!”","","“萨姆·特尔费尔，”戴宽檐帽的又嚷道，“你这个该死的老无赖，把蹄子伸过来，咱们握握！”"
"Their hands clasped in the brief, tight greeting of the West that is death to the hand-shake microbe.","","他们按照西部的方式紧握了一下手，连手上的细菌都给挤死了。"
"“You old fat rascal!” continued Wide-Brim, with a wrinkled brown smile; “it’s been five years since I seen you.","","“你这个发福的老流氓！”戴宽檐帽的皮肤黝黑的人面带微笑，接着说道，“五年没看见你了。"
"I been in this town a week, but you can’t find nobody in such a place.","","我来这个城市一个星期了，可是在这种地方一个朋友也找不到。"
"Well, you dinged old married man, how are they coming?”","","嗨，你这个娶了老婆的老家伙，怎么样啦？”"
"Something mushy and heavily soft like raised dough leaned against Jim’s leg and chewed his trousers with a yeasty growl.","","一个像发面团似的、又软又重的东西靠在吉姆腿上狺狺叫着，咬他的裤子。"
"“Get to work,” said Jim, “and explain this yard-wide hydrophobia yearling you’ve throwed your lasso over.","","“说话啊，”吉姆说，“你套索拴的这个狂犬病肥畜崽子是怎么回事？"
"Are you the pound-master of this burg?","","你是这个城市的兽栏管理员吗？"
"Do you call that a dog or what?”","","你们管它叫狗还是叫什么？”"
"“I need a drink,” said the dogman, dejected at the reminder of his old dog of the sea.","","“我想喝一杯，”狗人说，一提起这条让他苦恼的狗，他就非常沮丧，"
"“Come on.”","","“走吧。”"
"Hard by was a café.","","附近有一家小餐馆。"
"’Tis ever so in the big city.","","这在大城市里很普遍。"
"They sat at a table, and the bloated monster yelped and scrambled at the end of his leash to get at the café cat.","","他们在一张桌子旁坐下，那个臃肿的畜生拖着皮带吠着，想扑向餐馆里的猫。"
"“Whiskey,” said Jim to the waiter.","","“威士忌。”吉姆对侍者说道。"
"“Make it two,” said the dogman.","","“我也要一样的。”狗人说道。"
"“You’re fatter,” said Jim, “and you look subjugated.","","“你胖啦，”吉姆说，“而且看上去克制多了。"
"I don’t know about the East agreeing with you.","","没想到东部对你倒挺合适的。"
"All the boys asked me to hunt you up when I started.","","我动身的时候，弟兄们都让我找你。"
"Sandy King, he went to the Klondike.","","桑迪·金到克朗代克去了。"
"Watson Burrel, he married the oldest Peters girl.","","沃森·伯勒尔和彼得斯家的大女儿结婚了。"
"I made some money buying beeves, and I bought a lot of wild land up on the Little Powder.","","我做牛肉生意挣了点儿钱，就在小保德河附近买了块荒地。"
"Going to fence next fall.","","我打算明年秋天把它圈起来。"
"Bill Rawlins, he’s gone to farming.","","比尔·罗林斯去搞农场了。"
"You remember Bill, of course—he was courting Marcella—excuse me, Sam—I mean the lady you married, while she was teaching school at Prairie View.","","你一定记得比尔——他追过玛塞拉——对不起，萨姆——我指的是你夫人，那时她还在普雷里维教书。"
"But you was the lucky man.","","不过你是个幸运儿。"
"How is Missis Telfair?”","","特尔费尔太太好吗？”"
"“S-h-h-h!” said the dogman, signalling the waiter; “give it a name.”","","“喂！”狗人一边招呼着侍者，一边说道，“要什么？”"
"“Whiskey,” said Jim.","","“威士忌。”吉姆说。"
"“Make it two,” said the dogman.","","“我也要一样的。”狗人说。"
"“She’s well,” he continued, after his chaser.","","“她很好，”狗人喝了口酒后接着说道，"
"“She refused to live anywhere but in New York, where she came from.","","“除了纽约，她哪儿也不愿意去，她是纽约人。"

"Like to stay longer, but I can’t.”","","我想多呆一会儿，可是不行。”"
"“I’ll walk down to the ferry with you,” said the dogman.","","“我陪你去渡口。”狗人说。"
"The dog had bound a leg each of Jim and the chair together, and had sunk into a comatose slumber.","","那条狗用皮带把吉姆的一条腿和一个桌子腿缠在了一起，自己却昏昏沉沉地睡着了。"
