"How Geirald the Coward was Punished","懦夫盖拉尔德受惩记"
"by Andrew Lang","作者：安德鲁·朗格"
"Once upon a time there lived a poor knight who had a great many children, and found it very hard to get enough for them to eat.","很久以前，有一位贫穷的骑士，他有很多小孩，却很难让每一个孩子都吃饱。"
"One day he sent his eldest son, Rosald, a brave and honest youth, to the neighbouring town to do some business, and here Rosald met a young man named Geirald, with whom he made friends.","他的大儿子罗萨德是一个勇敢诚实的年轻人。一天，父亲让他去邻近的小镇上做点儿小生意，在那里，罗萨德认识了一个名叫盖拉尔德的年轻人，并与他成了朋友。"
"Now Geirald was the son of a rich man, who was proud of the boy, and had all his life allowed him to do whatever he fancied, and, luckily for the father, he was prudent and sensible, and did not waste money, as many other rich young men might have done.","盖拉尔德的父亲很有钱，而且为他儿子感到自豪，在他一生中，无论盖拉尔德想要什么，他统统都会满足他。令父亲感到幸运的是，盖拉尔德是一个谨慎、懂事的人，跟大多数有钱的年轻人不一样，他并不浪费钱财。"
"For some time he had set his heart on travelling into foreign countries, and after he had been talking for a little while to Rosald, he asked if his new friend would be his companion on his journey.","有一段时间，盖拉尔德迷上了出国旅游，在与罗萨德聊了一会儿之后，他问这位新结识的朋友是否愿意跟他一起旅行。"
"‘There is nothing I should like better,’ answered Rosald, shaking his head sorrowfully; ‘but my father is very poor, and he could never give me the money.’","“没有比这更愿意的事了，”罗萨德回答说，却又难过地摇了摇头，“但是我的父亲很穷，他没有钱给我去旅行。”"
"‘Oh, if that is your only difficulty, it is all right,’ cried Geirald.","盖拉尔德大叫道：“哦，如果这是你唯一的困难，这很好办。"
"‘My father has more money than he knows what to do with, and he will give me as much as I want for both of us; only, there is one thing you must promise me, Rosald, that, supposing we have any adventures, you will let the honour and glory of them fall to me.’","我的父亲有很多很多钱，多得不知道该拿去做些什么，我们想要多少，他就会给多少；但是罗萨德，你得答应我一件事，假设我们历经许多冒险，你得把冒险中所得的荣誉都给我。”"
"‘Yes, of course, that is only fair,’ answered Rosald, who never cared about putting himself forward.","“好的，当然，这绝对公平，”罗萨德回答道，他从不计较谁出风头，"
"‘But I cannot go without telling my parents.","“但是出发之前我必须告诉我的父母。"
"I am sure they will think me lucky to get such a chance.’","他们肯定会认为我是多么幸运才能得到这次机会。”"
"As soon as the business was finished, Rosald hastened home.","一做完生意，罗萨德就急忙回了家。"
"His parents were delighted to hear of his good fortune, and his father gave him his own sword, which was growing rusty for want of use, while his mother saw that his leather jerkin was in order.","听到他遇到这么好的机会，他的父母感到非常高兴，父亲把自己的剑送给了他，由于长时间不用，这把剑渐渐生了锈，而母亲让他整理好穿在身上的紧身皮上衣。"
"‘Be sure you keep the promise you made to Geirald,’ said she, as she bade him good-bye, ‘and, come what may, see that you never betray him.’","“一定要信守对盖拉尔德的诺言，”母亲在告别的时候叮嘱道，“不管怎样，你都不能背叛他。”"
"Full of joy Rosald rode off, and the next day he and Geirald started off to seek adventures.","罗萨德满怀欢喜，骑上马离开了家。第二天，他与盖拉尔德开始了探险之旅。"
"To their disappointment their own land was so well governed that nothing out of the common was very likely to happen, but directly they crossed the border into another kingdom all seemed lawlessness and confusion.","令他们失望的是，自己的王国被治理得井井有条，不像会发生什么不寻常的事，但是当他们一越过边界，进入另一个王国时，一切看起来都乱无法纪。"
"They had not gone very far, when, riding across a mountain, they caught a glimpse of several armed men hiding amongst some trees in their path, and remembered suddenly some talk they had heard of a band of twelve robbers who lay in wait for rich travellers.","他们骑着马翻过了一座山，并没有走多远，这时，他们瞥见树丛里面藏着几个带着武器的人，他们突然记起一些关于12个强盗的传说，听说这12个人总是埋伏在路上，抢劫有钱的游客们。"
"The robbers were more like savage beasts than men, and lived somewhere at the top of the mountain in caves and holes in the ground.","这些强盗不像人，更像是残暴的野兽。他们住在山顶的某个山洞里和地上的某个洞穴中。"
"They were all called ‘Hankur,’ and were distinguished one from another by the name of a colour—blue, grey, red, and so on, except their chief, who was known as Hankur the Tall.","他们都被叫做“汉克”，通过名字中的颜色——蓝色、灰色、红色等，把他们一一区别开来，但他们的强盗头除外，他的名字叫做高个子汉克。"
"All this and more rushed into the minds of the two young men as they saw the flash of their swords in the moonlight.","在他们思绪万千的时候，他们看见盗贼的剑在月光下闪着寒光。"
"‘It is impossible to fight them—they are twelve to two,’ whispered Geirald, stopping his horse in the path.","“跟他们硬拼肯定不行——他们有12个人，我们才有2个，”盖拉尔德停下了马，小声嘀咕着，"
"‘We had much better ride back and take the lower road.","“我们最好往回骑，走低一点儿的那条路。"
"It would be stupid to throw away our lives like this.’","要是像这样丢掉性命就太愚蠢了。”"
"‘Oh, we can’t turn back,’ answered Rosald, ‘we should be ashamed to look anyone in the face again!","“不，我们不能回去，”罗萨德回答道，“否则，我们就没脸再见任何人了！"
"And, besides, it is a grand opportunity to show what we are made of.","而且除此之外，这是一个展示我们自己的大好机会啊！"
"Let us tie up our horses here, and climb up the rocks so that we can roll stones down on them.’","我们把马拴在这儿，然后爬到有岩石块的高处，这样我们就能够滚下石头砸他们。”"
"‘Well, we might try that, and then we shall always have our horses,’ said Geirald.","“好吧，我们或许可以试试，接着我们总是应该牵回我们的马。”盖拉尔德说。"
"So they went up the rocks silently and carefully.","于是他们悄悄地、小心翼翼地爬到那些岩石顶上。"
"The robbers were lying all ready, expecting every moment to see their victims coming round the corner a few yards away, when a shower of huge stones fell on their heads, killing half the band.","这些盗贼都已经埋伏好了，时时刻刻期待着看见他们的目标物从几米外的那个拐角过来。就在这时候，巨大的石块如雨一般倾泻而下，砸中了他们的头，有一半的强盗被砸死了。"
"The others sprang up the rock, but as they reached the top the sword of Rosald swung round, and one man after another rolled down into the valley.","其他的强盗则往罗萨德他们所在的地方赶去，然而当他们逼近顶处时，只见罗萨德挥舞着剑，强盗们一个接一个地滚进了山谷。"
"At last the chief managed to spring up, and, grasping Rosald by the waist, flung away his sword, and the two fought desperately, their bodies swaying always nearer the edge.","最后，强盗头出现了，他抓住了罗萨德的腰，设法打掉了他手中的剑，两人拼命厮打起来，身体一直在靠近山崖边缘的地方移动。"
"It seemed as if Rosald, being the smaller of the two, MUST fall over, when, with his left hand, he drew the robber’s sword out of its sheath and plunged it into his heart.","罗萨德个头不如那个强盗头，看起来似乎必定会滚下山崖，突然，他左手从强盗头的剑鞘中抽出了剑，然后刺进了强盗头的心脏。"
"Then he took from the dead man a beautiful ring set with a large stone, and put it on his own finger.","强盗头被杀死了，罗萨德取下了他的戒指，上面嵌着一颗大宝石，非常漂亮，他把它戴在了自己的手上。"
"The fame of this wonderful deed soon spread through the country, and people would often stop Geirald’s horse, and ask leave to see the robber’s ring, which was said to have been stolen from the father of the reigning king.","这件令人赞叹不已的英雄事迹迅速传遍了全国，王国里的百姓经常拦住盖拉尔德的马，请求盖拉尔德让他们看看那个强盗头的戒指，据说这枚戒指是从现任国王的父亲那里偷来的。"
"And Geirald showed them the ring with pride, and listened to their words of praise, and no one would ever have guessed anyone else had destroyed the robbers.","盖拉尔德自豪地把戒指展示给他们看，享受着他们的赞美之词，没有人会去怀疑是别人消灭了盗贼团伙。"
"In a few days they left the kingdom and rode on to another, where they thought they would stop through the remainder of the winter, for Geirald liked to be comfortable, and did not care about travelling through ice and snow.","几天后，他们离开了王国，骑马前往下一个国家，他们想自己可能会在下一个地方呆到冬天结束，因为盖拉尔德更愿意舒舒服服的，并不喜欢在冰雪中穿行。"
"But the king would only grant them leave to stop on condition that, before the winter was ended, they should give him some fresh proof of the courage of which he had heard so much.","国王允许他们留下来，但有一个条件，那就是在冬天结束之前，他们应该拿出新的证据来证明他们的胆量，而关于他们胆量的事国王已经听过很多了。"
"Rosald’s heart was glad at the king’s message, and as for Geirald, he felt that as long as Rosald was there all would go well.","罗萨德听到国王的要求后非常开心，而盖拉尔德感觉只要有罗萨德在，一切就会很顺利。"
"So they both bowed low and replied that it was the king’s place to command and theirs to obey.","于是他们都深鞠了一躬，回答说，他们会听从国王的吩咐。"
"‘Well, then,’ said his Majesty, ‘this is what I want you to do: In the north-east part of my kingdom there dwells a giant, who has an iron staff twenty yards long, and he is so quick in using it, that even fifty knights have no chance against him.","“很好，那么，”国王陛下说，“有件事我想让你们去做：在王国的东北部住着一个巨人，他有一个铁制的武器，长度超过20码，他使起它来动作非常迅速，即使50个骑士加起来也不是他的对手。"
"The bravest and strongest young men of my court have fallen under the blows of that staff; but, as you overcame the twelve robbers so easily, I feel that I have reason to hope that you may be able to conquer the giant.","在我宫廷中最为勇猛、强壮的年轻人都曾被他的武器重击在地。既然你们如此轻易地消灭了12个盗贼，我想我有理由对你们抱有希望，你们或许可以打败那个巨人。"
"In three days from this you will set out.’","三天后你们就出发。”"
"‘We will be ready, your Majesty,’ answered Rosald; but Geirald remained silent.","罗萨德回答说：“陛下，我们会做好准备的。”然而盖拉尔德却不说话。"
"‘How can we possibly fight against a giant that has killed fifty knights?’ cried Geirald, when they were outside the castle.","当他们走出城堡，盖拉尔德喊道：“我们怎么可能打败巨人呢？他可曾经杀了50个骑士啊。"
"‘The king only wants to get rid of us!","国王只是想摆脱我们！"
"He won’t think about us for the next three days—that is one comfort—so we shall have plenty of time to cross the borders of the kingdom and be out of reach.’","接下来的三天，他不会管我们的死活了——我有一个解决方法——我们有足够时间越过这个王国的边界，他们抓不到我们的。”"
"‘We mayn’t be able to kill the giant, but we certainly can’t run away till we have tried,’ answered Rosald.","罗萨德说：“我们有可能杀不死巨人，但在还没尝试之前，我们绝对不能逃跑。"
"‘Besides, think how glorious it will be if we DO manage to kill him!","而且想想，如果我们确实想办法杀死了巨人，对于我们来说，那是一件多么荣耀的事啊！"
"I know what sort of weapon I shall use.","我知道我应该使用什么样的武器。"
"Come with me now, and I will see about it.’","现在跟我来，我会安排的。”"
" And, taking his friend by the arm, he led him into a shop where he bought a huge lump of solid iron, so big that they could hardly lift it between them.","然后，罗萨德挽着他朋友的胳膊，带他进了一家商铺，在那里他买了一坚固的大铁块，大得几乎他们两人都抬不起来。"
"However, they just managed to carry it to a blacksmith’s where Rosald directed that it should be beaten into a thick club, with a sharp spike at one end.","然而，他们想方设法地把它抬进了一家铁匠铺，在罗萨德的指导下，铁块被打造成一根粗铁棒，铁棒的一端是锋利的尖头。"
"When this was done to his liking he took it home under his arm.","等武器按照罗萨德所说的那样打造完成之后，他就用一条胳膊夹着铁棒，把它带回了家。"
"Very early on the third morning the two young men started on their journey, and on the fourth day they reached the giant’s cave before he was out of bed.","第三天一大清早，这两个年轻人就出发了，第四天还没等巨人醒来，他们就赶到了他的洞穴。"
"Hearing the sound of footsteps, the giant got up and went to the entrance to see who was coming, and Rosald, expecting something of the sort, struck him such a blow on the forehead that he fell to the ground.","一切如罗萨德所料，巨人听到脚步声后起床走到洞口，想看看是谁来了，这时他用之前打造的武器狠狠地朝巨人的前额刺去，巨人倒在了地上。"
"Then, before he could rise to his feet again, Rosald drew out his sword and cut off his head.","然后，在巨人再次站起来之前，罗萨德就拔出了剑，砍掉了巨人的脑袋。"
"‘It was not so difficult after all, you see,’ he said, turning to Geirald.","他转向盖拉尔德，对他说：“看吧，其实并不是很难。”"
"And placing the giant’s head in a leathern wallet which was slung over his back, they began their journey to the castle.","他把巨人的头放进一个皮袋子里，把皮袋往背上一甩，他们开始向城堡走去。"
"As they drew near the gates, Rosald took the head from the wallet and handed it to Geirald, whom he followed into the king’s presence.","当他们快到城门口的时候，罗萨德从皮袋中取出巨人的头，并交到盖拉尔德的手里，随后跟着盖拉尔德面见了国王。"
"‘The giant will trouble you no more,’ said Geirald, holding out the head.","盖拉尔德说：“这个巨人以后再也不会给你造成任何麻烦了。”边说边拿出巨人的头。"
"And the king fell on his neck and kissed him, and cried joyfully that he was the ‘bravest knight in all the world, and that a feast should be made for him and Rosald, and that the great deed should be proclaimed throughout the kingdom.’","国王低下头亲吻了他，开心地大声说：“你是全世界最勇敢的骑士，我应该为你和罗萨德举办一个盛宴，而且这件极大的好事应该通报整个王国。”"
" And Geirald’s heart swelled with pride, and he almost forgot that it was Rosald and not he, who had slain the giant.","盖拉尔德扬扬自得，他几乎忘了杀死巨人的是罗萨德而不是他自己。"
"By-and-by a whisper went round that a beautiful lady who lived in the castle would be present at the feast, with twenty-four lovely maidens, her attendants.","不久，有人私下传言，说城堡里住着一位美丽的女士，她将会出席这次盛宴，随行的还有24位可爱的侍婢。"
"The lady was the queen of her own country, but as her father and mother had died when she was a little girl, she had been left in the care of this king who was her uncle.","这位美丽的女士是她自己国家的女王，但是还在她年幼时，父母就去世了，所以她由叔叔照顾，也就是这个王国的国王。"
"She was now old enough to govern her own kingdom, but her subjects did not like being ruled by a woman, and said that she must find a husband to help her in managing her affairs.","现在她长大了，可以来管理自己的王国，但是她的臣民不喜欢受一个女人统治，他们说她必须找到她的另一半，并由她的丈夫帮助她管理国家事务。"
"Prince after prince had offered himself, but the young queen would have nothing to say to any of them, and at last told her ministers that if she was to have a husband at all she must choose him for herself, as she would certainly not marry any of those whom they had selected for her.","王子们一个接一个地前来求婚，但是这位年轻的女王一个也不满意，最后她告诉大臣们，如果她非找丈夫不可，那么必须由她自己来选择，因为她一定不会嫁给他们为她所选择的人。"
"The ministers replied that in that case she had better manage her kingdom alone, and the queen, who knew nothing about business, got things into such a confusion that at last she threw them up altogether, and went off to her uncle.","大臣们回应说既然是这样，那她最好自己来治理她的国家，他们什么都不管了。然而这位女王对治理国家一点儿都不懂，把事情弄得一团糟，最后她抛下了一切来投奔她的叔叔。"
"Now when she heard how the two young men had slain the giant, her heart was filled with admiration of their courage, and she declared that if a feast was held she would certainly be present at it.","如今她听说有两个年轻的男士打垮了巨人，对于他们的勇气，她表示由衷的敬佩，她宣称如果为他们准备盛宴，那她一定会去参加。"
"And so she was; and when the feast was over she asked the king, her guardian, if he would allow the two heroes who had killed the robbers and slain the giant to fight a tourney the next day with one of her pages.","她确实来了。当盛宴结束的时候，她向国王，也就是她的监护人提出一个请求：能否让这两位曾经杀死盗贼和打垮巨人的英雄，在明天与她的一位侍从进行一次比试。"
"The king gladly gave his consent, and ordered the lists to be made ready, never doubting that two great champions would be eager for such a chance of adding to their fame.","国王很高兴地同意了，然后下令准备好名单，他深信这两位斗士将会非常渴望能有这次机会来提高他们的名气。"
"Little did he guess that Geirald had done all he could to persuade Rosald to steal secretly out of the castle during the night, ‘for,’ said he, ‘I don’t believe they are pages at all, but well-proved knights, and how can we, so young and untried, stand up against them?’","他怎么也猜不到，盖拉尔德竭尽全力地说服罗萨德趁着夜色偷偷溜出城堡。“因为，”盖拉尔德说，“我一点儿都不相信他们会是侍从，他们肯定是通过考验的优秀骑士，我们那么年轻，又没有经验，怎么能抵抗他们呢？”"
"‘The honour will be all the higher if we gain the day,’ answered Rosald; but Geirald would listen to nothing, and only declared that he did not care about honour, and would rather be alive than have every honour in the world heaped upon him.","罗萨德回答说：“如果我们明天赢了，将是至高无上的荣誉。”但是盖拉尔德什么都听不进去，只是声明他并不关心什么荣誉，与其把世界上每一个荣誉堆在自己身上，还不如活着。"
"Go he would, and as Rosald had sworn to give him his company, he must come with him.","盖拉尔德下定决心离开，由于罗萨德曾经发誓做他的旅伴，所以他必须跟着他。"
"Rosald was much grieved when he heard these words, but he knew that it was useless attempting to persuade Geirald, and turned his thoughts to forming some plan to prevent this disgraceful flight.","当听到盖拉尔德的这些话时，罗萨德感到很难过，但是他知道试图说服盖拉尔德是没有用的，于是他转而考虑其他的计划，来阻止这次不光彩的逃跑。"
"Suddenly his face brightened.","突然，他脸上露出了喜色。"
"‘Let us change clothes,’ he said, ‘and I will do the fighting, while you shall get the glory.","“我们可以换衣服，”他说，“我将参加比武，而你将获得荣誉。"
"Nobody will ever know.’","没有人会知道的。”"
" And to this Geirald readily consented.","盖拉尔德很快地同意了。"
"Whether Geirald was right or not in thinking that the so-called page was really a well-proved knight, it is certain that Rosald’s task was a very hard one.","盖拉尔德认为所谓的侍从其实是通过严格考验的真正骑士，不管他的推测是否正确，这次比试对罗萨德来说确实是一次非常艰难的任务。"
"Three times they came together with a crash which made their horses reel; once Rosald knocked the helmet off his foe, and received in return such a blow that he staggered in his saddle.","双方发生三次激烈的碰撞，使得双方战马站立不稳，一次罗萨德打下对手的头盔，同时受到狠狠的回击，一个没坐稳，差点儿从马上掉下来。"
"Shouts went up from the lookers-on, as first one and then the other seemed gaining the victory; but at length Rosald planted his spear in the armour which covered his adversary’s breast and bore him steadily backward.","当双方打得难分胜负的时候，周围观战的人们高声欢呼；然而在最后，罗萨德将手里的长矛瞄准对手的胸部的盔甲刺去，使得对手径直往后倒去。"
"‘Unhorsed! unhorsed!’ cried the people; and Rosald then himself dismounted and helped his adversary to rise.","“摔下马了！摔下马了！”人们大声喊叫着。然后罗萨德下了马，把对手扶了起来。"
"In the confusion that followed it was easy for Rosald to slip away and return Geirald his proper clothes.","趁着一片混乱，罗萨德轻易地溜走了，然后把衣服给了盖拉尔德。"
"And in these, torn and dusty with the fight, Geirald answered the king’s summons to come before him.","盖拉尔德穿着这身在激战中受到磨损、沾满尘土的铠甲，接受了国王的传唤，来到他的面前。"
"‘You have done what I expected you to do,’ said he, ‘and now, choose your reward.’","“你不负我的期望，完成了比试，”他说，“现在，你可以挑选你的奖励了。”"
"‘Grant me, sire, the hand of the queen, your niece,’ replied the young man, bowing low, ‘and I will defend her kingdom against all her enemies.’","“国王陛下，请允许我娶女王殿下，也就是你的外甥女为妻，”这位年轻人深深一鞠躬，回答说，“我将保卫她的王国不受外敌的侵略。”"
"‘She could choose no better husband,’ said the king, ‘and if she consents I do.’","“再也没有比你更适合做她丈夫的人选了，”国王说，“如果她愿意，我会同意的。”"
" And he turned towards the queen, who had not been present during the fight, but had just slipped into a seat by his right hand.","然后他转向女王，比试的时候，她并不在场，刚刚才悄悄地坐在了国王的左手边。"
"Now the queen’s eyes were very sharp, and it seemed to her that the man who stood before her, tall and handsome though he might be, was different in many slight ways, and in one in particular, from the man who had fought the tourney.","此刻女王的眼神非常敏锐，对于她来说，站在她面前的这位年轻人，尽管高大帅气，但是却在一些微小的地方有所不同，尤其是与刚才那个战斗中的人看起来不一样。"
"How there could be any trickery she could not understand, and why the real victor should be willing to give up his prize to another was still stranger; but something in her heart warned her to be careful.","她不明白其中有什么花招，为什么真正的赢者愿意拱手让出自己的奖励，这仍然让人觉得奇怪，但是她的内心警告自己要谨慎点儿。"
"She answered: ‘You may be satisfied, uncle, but I am not.","她回答说：“叔叔，您可能很满意，但我却没有。"
"One more proof I must have; let the two young men now fight against each other.","我必须多增一个比试；让这两位年轻人现在就互相战斗。"
"The man I marry must be the man who killed the robbers and the giant, and overcame my page.’","我嫁的人必须是那个杀死了盗贼和巨人、又打败了我的侍从的人。”"
" Geirald’s face grew pale as he heard these words.","听到这些话，盖拉尔德的脸色刷地一下变白了。"
"He knew there was no escape from him now, though he did not doubt for one moment that Rosald would keep his compact loyally to the last.","他知道现在他逃不掉了，尽管他每时每刻都坚信罗萨德会遵守协定，对他忠诚到底。"
"But how would it be possible that even Rosald should deceive the watchful eyes of the king and his court, and still more those of the young queen whom he felt uneasily had suspected him from the first?","然而这怎么可能，罗萨德怎么能骗过国王的眼睛、大臣的眼睛、年轻女王的眼睛，况且他不安地感觉到这位女王从一开始就怀疑他。"
"The tourney was fought, and in spite of Geirald’s fears Rosald managed to hang back to make attacks which were never meant to succeed, and to allow strokes which he could easily have parried to attain their end.","比试开始了，尽管盖拉尔德很害怕，但罗萨德设法往后退，并做出没有进攻力的回击，他本应该能很轻易地回避盖拉尔德的攻击，但却让每一个攻击都成功了。"
"At length, after a great show of resistance, he fell heavily to the ground.","最后，在一场精彩的战斗表演后，他重重地倒在了地上。"
"And as he fell he knew that it was not alone the glory that was his rightfully which he gave up, but the hand of the queen that was more precious still.","当他跌倒时，他知道他放弃的不仅仅是属于他的荣誉，还有更为珍贵的女王的手。"
"But Geirald did not even wait to see if he was wounded; he went straight to the wall where the royal banner waved and claimed the reward which was now his.","但是盖拉尔德甚至并不着急察看罗萨德受伤与否；他径直地走向挥舞着王室横幅的墙那边，宣称现在奖励是他的了。"
"The crowd of watchers turned towards the queen, expecting to see her stoop and give some token to the victor.","观战的人群看向女王，期待看到女王弯下腰，然后对赢的人有所表示。"
"Instead, to the surprise of everyone, she merely smiled gracefully, and said that before she bestowed her hand one more test must be imposed, but this should be the last.","相反，她的表现令所有人感到吃惊，她仅仅优雅地笑了笑，然后说在她交出她的手之前，还必须举办一个比赛，不过这将是最后一个。"
"The final tourney should be fought; Geirald and Rosald should meet singly two knights of the king’s court, and he who could unhorse his foe should be master of herself and of her kingdom.","最后的比赛即将打响；盖拉尔德和罗萨德将分别迎战王室中的一位骑士，谁能把对手打下马，谁就能成为她的丈夫并掌管她的王国。"
"The combat was fixed to take place at ten o’clock the following day.","大战开始的时间定在明天十点。"
"All night long Geirald walked about his room, not daring to face the fight that lay in front of him, and trying with all his might to discover some means of escaping it.","一整个晚上，盖拉尔德在房间里走来走去，他不敢面对明天将迎来的比试，想方设法地试着找出一些逃脱的方法。"
"All night long he moved restlessly from door to window; and when the trumpets sounded, and the combatants rode into the field, he alone was missing.","整个晚上，他不安地徘徊于门和窗户之间，当号角吹响，比赛选手骑着马进场的时候，唯独没有看见他。"
"The king sent messengers to see what had become of him, and he was found, trembling with fear, hiding under his bed.","国王派信使去看看他怎么了，信使找到了他，只见他躲在床下，害怕得直发抖。"
"After that there was no need of any further proof.","在此之后，再也不需要任何进一步证明了。"
"The combat was declared unnecessary, and the queen pronounced herself quite satisfied, and ready to accept Rosald as her husband.","这场比试被宣布取消，女王宣布她非常满意，准备接受罗萨德成为她的丈夫。"
"‘You forgot one thing,’ she said, when they were alone.","“你忘了一件事，”当他们单独在一起的时候，她说，"
"‘I recognized my father’s ring which Hankur the Tall had stolen, on the finger of your right hand, and I knew that it was you and not Geirald who had slain the robber band.","“我认出戴在你右手手指上被高个子汉克偷走的戒指，那是我父亲的，然后我知道杀死盗贼团伙的人是你而不是盖拉尔德。"
"I was the page who fought you, and again I saw the ring on your finger, though it was absent from his when he stood before me to claim the prize.","我就是那个跟你比试的侍从，我再次看见了你手指上的戒指，但是当他站在我面前提出奖励要求时，他手上并没有戒指。"
"That was why I ordered the combat between you, though your faith to your word prevented my plan being successful, and I had to try another.","所以我下令你们互相比试，但是你的忠诚破坏了我的计划，我不得不尝试其他办法。"
"The man who keeps his promise at all costs to himself is the man I can trust, both for myself and for my people.’","一个能不顾一切遵守诺言的人才是我能信任的人，不仅是为了我自己，而且也为了我的臣民。”"
"So they were married, and returned to their own kingdom, which they ruled well and happily.","于是他们结婚了，回到了女王的王国，把王国治理得井井有条，过着幸福的生活。"
"And many years after a poor beggar knocked at the palace gates and asked for money, for the sake of days gone by—and this was Geirald.","许多年后，一个可怜的乞丐在城堡外敲门要钱，看在过去的日子——这个人就是盖拉尔德。"
