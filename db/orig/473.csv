"Section 1","第一节"
"I HAVE set myself to write the story of the Great Change, so far as it has affected my own life and the lives of one or two people closely connected with me, primarily to please myself.","目前，《巨变》这篇作品对我的生活及我身边一两位关系密切的人的生活都产生了影响。我之所以创作这个故事，主要还是自娱自乐。"
"Long ago in my crude unhappy youth, I conceived the desire of writing a book.","早在艰苦悲惨的青年时代，我就产生了创作一本书的愿望。"
"To scribble secretly and dream of authorship was one of my chief alleviations, and I read with a sympathetic envy every scrap I could get about the world of literature and the lives of literary people.","私底下写草稿、梦想成为作家曾是我的主要慰藉之一。无论是文学作品还是文学家的故事，只要是我能找到的，哪怕是只言片语，我都读得很有共鸣，觉得钦慕不已。"
"It is something, even amidst this present happiness, to find leisure and opportunity to take up and partially realize these old and hopeless dreams.","即使在当下这种快乐的生活下，若能找到空闲时间重操旧业，找机会将曾经无望的幻想变成现实，哪怕只能实现一部分，那也是一件有意义的事。"
"But that alone, in a world where so much of vivid and increasing interest presents itself to be done, even by an old man, would not, I think, suffice to set me at this desk.","但我想，仅凭这一个理由，却不足以让我潜心写作，即使我已是一位老者。因为在这个世界上，有这么多生机勃勃、越来越吸引人的事情诱惑着我们。"
"I find some such recapitulation of my past as this will involve, is becoming necessary to my own secure mental continuity.","我发现，像这样在写作中回首、总结自己的过去越来越有必要，以使我的心智保持长期以来的一致性。"
"The passage of years brings a man at last to retrospection; at seventy-two one’s youth is far more important than it was at forty.","时光的流逝最终会让人回首往昔。青春时光对于四十岁的人而言可能不算什么，但等他到了七十二岁时，这段时光就会重要得多了。"
"And I am out of touch with my youth.","而我的青春已经逝去。"
"The old life seems so cut off from the new, so alien and so unreasonable, that at times I find it bordering upon the incredible.","往昔的岁月似乎与新的生活全然没了交点，如此陌生，如此不合情理，有时我甚至觉得过去的生活可谓难以置信。"
"The data have gone, the buildings and places.","数据已荡然无存，老建筑与老地方也消失殆尽。"
"I stopped dead the other afternoon in my walk across the moor, where once the dismal outskirts of Swathinglea straggled toward Leet, and asked, “Was it here indeed that I crouched among the weeds and refuse and broken crockery and loaded my revolver ready for murder?","一天午后，我在步行穿过荒野时猛然停住，当年斯瓦辛格利破败的郊景现在已快扩展到利特了。我问自己：“当年我就是蹲在这儿的野草丛和垃圾堆中，摔碎陶器、上好左轮手枪准备杀人的吗？"
"Did ever such a thing happen in my life?","我的一生中真的发生过这种事情吗？"
"Was such a mood and thought and intention ever possible to me?","我真的有过这种心境、想法和动机吗？"
"Rather, has not some queer nightmare spirit out of dreamland slipped a pseudo-memory into the records of my vanished life?”","或者，会不会是梦境里某个奇怪的噩梦精灵溜出来，将这些虚假的记忆悄悄塞进了我过去生活的记录中呢？”"
"There must be many alive still who have the same perplexities.","一定有很多依然健在的人有着和我一样的迷惑。"
"And I think too that those who are now growing up to take our places in the great enterprise of mankind, will need many such narratives as mine for even the most partial conception of the old world of shadows that came before our day.","我也在想，正在成长起来接替我们从事人类伟大事业的那些人，他们需要许多我所写的这类故事，以便对我们这个时代之前的那个蒙眬的旧世界有所了解，哪怕这种了解是极不完整的。"
"It chances too that my case is fairly typical of the Change; I was caught midway in a gust of passion; and a curious accident put me for a time in the very nucleus of the new order.","我的经历碰巧也算得上是“巨变”的一个非常典型的事例。我中途被突然迸发的一股激情所俘虏；一个古怪的偶然事件一时间将我卷入了新秩序的正中心。"
"My memory takes me back across the interval of fifty years to a little ill-lit room with a sash window open to a starry sky, and instantly there returns to me the characteristic smell of that room, the penetrating odor of an ill-trimmed lamp, burning cheap paraffin.","记忆将我带回50年前一间昏暗的小房间，房间里一扇推拉窗大敞着，空对着满天繁星。我随即回忆起当时房间里特有的气味——那是一盏油灯散发出的刺鼻气味，那盏灯没什么装饰，里面燃着廉价煤油。"
"Lighting by electricity had then been perfected for fifteen years, but still the larger portion of the world used these lamps.","那时，成熟的光电照明已有15年的历史，但世界上大部分地区依然点着这种煤油灯。"
"All this first scene will go, in my mind at least, to that olfactory accompaniment.","最初这一幕引起了嗅觉上的共鸣，至少在我脑海中是如此。"
"That was the evening smell of the room.","那就是房间夜晚的气味。"
"By day it had a more subtle aroma, a closeness, a peculiar sort of faint pungency that I associate—I know not why—with dust.","白天它散发一股更为清淡的香气，那是一股模模糊糊的刺鼻气味，感觉很近、很特别。不知何故，我总会把这种味道与灰尘联系在一起。"
"Let me describe this room to you in detail.","让我为你详细地描绘一下这个房间吧。"
"It was perhaps eight feet by seven in area and rather higher than either of these dimensions; the ceiling was of plaster, cracked and bulging in places, gray with the soot of the lamp, and in one place discolored by a system of yellow and olive-green stains caused by the percolation of damp from above.","房间长约8英尺，宽7英尺，高度较长宽来讲则更大；石膏屋顶裂纹斑斑、凹凸不平，被煤油灯的烟熏成了灰色，还有一处被天花板渗出的潮气染出了黄色与橄榄绿夹杂的印渍。"
"The walls were covered with dun-colored paper, upon which had been printed in oblique reiteration a crimson shape, something of the nature of a curly ostrich feather, or an acanthus flower, that had in its less faded moments a sort of dingy gaiety.","墙身贴着深褐色的墙纸，上面曾斜印着深红色的图案，形状有些像鸵鸟的卷毛，抑或是一种爵床科的花朵——在尚未完全凋零之前，曾经在昏暗中开得很艳。"
"There were several big plaster-rimmed wounds in this, caused by Parload’s ineffectual attempts to get nails into the wall, whereby there might hang pictures.","墙上有几大块石膏补过的地方，那是帕罗德试图在墙上钉钉子时留下的，只是钉子最终也没能钉进去，不然他可能会挂些画在上面。"
"One nail had hit between two bricks and got home, and from this depended, sustained a little insecurely by frayed and knotted blind-cord, Parload’s hanging bookshelves, planks painted over with a treacly blue enamel and further decorated by a fringe of pinked American cloth insecurely fixed by tacks.","一颗钉子在两块砖之间落了脚，上面悬着一根窗帘绳，绳子已经磨损，打着结，摇摇晃晃地挂着帕罗德的书架。书架的板条上刷了一层黏稠的蓝色搪瓷，上面用大头钉松松垮垮地钉着彩色漆布的锯齿形流苏作为装饰。"
"Below this was a little table that behaved with a mulish vindictiveness to any knee that was thrust beneath it suddenly; it was covered with a cloth whose pattern of red and black had been rendered less monotonous by the accidents of Parload’s versatile ink bottle, and on it, leit motif of the whole, stood and stank the lamp.","书架下面是一张小桌子，那架势就像是坚持要报复突然伸到它下面的每一双膝盖；桌上蒙着一块桌布，帕罗德的多功能墨水瓶偶尔在桌上打翻过，这使桌布红黑相间的图案不再那么单调了；桌上最醒目的地方放着一盏灯，散发着恶臭。"
"This lamp, you must understand, was of some whitish translucent substance that was neither china nor glass, it had a shade of the same substance, a shade that did not protect the eyes of a reader in any measure, and it seemed admirably adapted to bring into pitiless prominence the fact that, after the lamp’s trimming, dust and paraffin had been smeared over its exterior with a reckless generosity.","你要知道，这盏灯是用一种发白的半透明的材料做成的（那种材料不是陶瓷也不是玻璃），灯罩用的也是同一种材料，起不到一点儿保护读者眼睛的作用。它似乎恰到好处，无情地突显了下述事实，即灯点燃后，灰尘和煤油会不计后果、慷慨大方地糊在灯罩外面。"
"The uneven floor boards of this apartment were covered with scratched enamel of chocolate hue, on which a small island of frayed carpet dimly blossomed in the dust and shadows.","房间的地板凹凸不平，上面巧克力色的搪瓷已经满是划痕，一小块磨旧了的地毯在灰尘和阴影里若隐若现。"
"There was a very small grate, made of cast-iron in one piece and painted buff, and a still smaller misfit of a cast-iron fender that confessed the gray stone of the hearth.","房间里有一个很小的壁炉，涂着浅黄色的漆。壁炉由一整块铸铁制成，外面是一道更小、更不相称的铸铁护栏，围着灰色的壁炉铺石。"
"No fire was laid, only a few scraps of torn paper and the bowl of a broken corn-cob pipe were visible behind the bars, and in the corner and rather thrust away was an angular japanned coal-box with a damaged hinge.","炉里没有生火，只能看见炉栅后的几张碎纸片和一个坏了的玉米穗轴烟斗的斗。角落更深处是一个涂了亮漆、有尖角的煤箱，上面吊着一根破铰链。"
"It was the custom in those days to warm every room separately from a separate fireplace, more prolific of dirt than heat, and the rickety sash window, the small chimney, and the loose-fitting door were expected to organize the ventilation of the room among themselves without any further direction.","尽管使用不同的壁炉为各个房间单独供暖的方式会产生更多的灰尘，而不是更多的暖气，但在当时却是一种惯例。无需多言，摇晃的推拉窗、小烟囱和关不严的门保证了各个房间可以多通风。"
"Parload’s truckle bed hid its gray sheets beneath an old patchwork counterpane on one side of the room, and veiled his boxes and suchlike oddments, and invading the two corners of the window were an old whatnot and the washhandstand, on which were distributed the simple appliances of his toilet.","房间一边放着帕罗德的活动矮床，床上铺着灰不溜秋的床单，床单上罩着破旧的百衲床罩，他的箱子和类似的零碎物件也都用床罩蒙着。窗户两边的角落里各放着旧的陈列架和洗漱台，上面杂乱地摆着他的几件简单的盥洗用具。"
"This washhandstand had been made of deal by some one with an excess of turnery appliances in a hurry, who had tried to distract attention from the rough economies of his workmanship by an arresting ornamentation of blobs and bulbs upon the joints and legs.","洗漱台是松木制成的，做得很匆忙，绝大部分都是用车床完成的。为了掩饰其粗糙的工艺，制作者在洗漱台的接缝和腿架上装饰着一团团的球状物。"
"Apparently the piece had then been placed in the hands of some person of infinite leisure equipped with a pot of ocherous paint, varnish, and a set of flexible combs.","很显然，这个洗漱台后来落到了某个拥有无限闲暇的人手中，他应该有一罐赭色的油漆、一罐清漆和一套折叠梳子。"
"This person had first painted the article, then, I fancy, smeared it with varnish, and then sat down to work with the combs to streak and comb the varnish into a weird imitation of the grain of some nightmare timber.","我猜想，这个人应该先给洗漱台刷了一层油漆，然后喷上清漆，之后坐下来用梳子划，在清漆层上划出某种奇怪的条纹，就像某种可怕的木材的纹理。"
"The washhandstand so made had evidently had a prolonged career of violent use, had been chipped, kicked, splintered, punched, stained, scorched, hammered, dessicated, damped, and defiled, had met indeed with almost every possible adventure except a conflagration or a scrubbing, until at last it had come to this high refuge of Parload’s attic to sustain the simple requirements of Parload’s personal cleanliness.","很显然，曾有人长期粗暴地对待这个洗漱台。它曾被削过、踢过、劈过、猛击过，曾被染污、烧焦、捶打过，曾经干燥、潮湿过，被腐蚀过，实际上，除了大火和擦洗之外，几乎各种可能的危险它都经历过了，直到它最终流落到帕罗德家的顶楼这个高级避难所，成了帕罗德维持基本的个人卫生的工具。"
"There were, in chief, a basin and a jug of water and a slop-pail of tin, and, further, a piece of yellow soap in a tray, a tooth-brush, a rat-tailed shaving brush, one huckaback towel, and one or two other minor articles.","洗漱台上的主要物品有一个脸盆、一壶水和一个锡皮污水桶，以及一块放在盒里的黄色肥皂、一把牙刷、一把鼠尾状的修面刷、一条粗麻布毛巾和一两件小物品。"
"In those days only very prosperous people had more than such an equipage, and it is to be remarked that every drop of water Parload used had to be carried by an unfortunate servant girl,—the “slavey,” Parload called her—up from the basement to the top of the house and subsequently down again.","在那个年代，只有极为富有的人才用得起比这个还高级的物件。值得一提的是，帕罗德用的每一滴水都是由一位时运不济的女佣人（帕罗德叫她“奴隶”）从地下室提到顶楼，而后再从顶楼提下去的。"
"Already we begin to forget how modern an invention is personal cleanliness.","我们已经开始忘记，讲究个人卫生是一个多么现代的发明。"
"It is a fact that Parload had never stripped for a swim in his life; never had a simultaneous bath all over his body since his childhood.","事实上，帕罗德一生中从未脱掉衣服游过泳；而且自从童年起，他从未全部脱光后从头到尾地洗过澡。"
"Not one in fifty of us did in the days of which I am telling you.","在我向你讲述的那个年代，我们五十个人当中，没有一个曾经脱光了从头洗到脚。"
"A chest, also singularly grained and streaked, of two large and two small drawers, held Parload’s reserve of garments, and pegs on the door carried his two hats and completed this inventory of a “bed-sitting-room” as I knew it before the Change.","衣柜也同样被划出奇怪的纹理。衣柜有两个大抽屉和两个小抽屉，里面放着帕罗德的换洗衣服，门后的挂钩上挂着他的两顶帽子，这些加起来就是他的“卧室兼起居室”的全部家当，这是在巨变前我就知道的。"
"But I had forgotten—there was also a chair with a “squab” that apologized inadequately for the defects of its cane seat.","但我忘了——房间里还有一把椅子，椅子上垫着很厚的垫子，勉强弥补了藤椅的缺陷。"
"I forgot that for the moment because I was sitting on the chair on the occasion that best begins this story.","刚才我之所以忘记提到这把椅子，是因为我开始讲这个故事的时候正好就坐在它上面。"
"I have described Parload’s room with such particularity because it will help you to understand the key in which my earlier chapters are written, but you must not imagine that this singular equipment or the smell of the lamp engaged my attention at that time to the slightest degree.","我如此详尽地描述帕罗德的房间，是因为这会帮助你理解我前面几章所描写的重点，但请你不要认为，这种奇怪的家具或是煤油灯的气味当时曾引起我丝毫的注意。"
"I took all this grimy unpleasantness as if it were the most natural and proper setting for existence imaginable.","在我当时看来，这些污秽的、令人不快的环境似乎是我所能想象出的非常自然的生存环境，没有任何不妥之处。"
"It was the world as I knew it.","那是我所熟知的世界。"
"My mind was entirely occupied then by graver and intenser matters, and it is only now in the distant retrospect that I see these details of environment as being remarkable, as significant, as indeed obviously the outward visible manifestations of the old world disorder in our hearts.","那时我脑中充斥着更为严肃、更为紧张的问题，只有现在回首久远的往昔时，我才认识到环境中的这些细节是值得注意、意味深长的，事实上，它显然是我们心中旧世界混乱状态的外在、可见的表现。"," "
"Section 2","第二节"
"Parload stood at the open window, opera-glass in hand, and sought and found and was uncertain about and lost again, the new comet.","帕罗德站在敞开的窗户前，拿着观剧望远镜寻找新彗星。一会儿，他发现了新彗星，但又不确定，过一会儿，那个彗星又不见了。"
"I thought the comet no more than a nuisance then because I wanted to talk of other matters.","当时我觉得彗星不过是个讨厌的东西，因为我想谈论别的话题。"
"But Parload was full of it.","但帕罗德却满脑子都是彗星。"
"My head was hot, I was feverish with interlacing annoyances and bitterness, I wanted to open my heart to him—at least I wanted to relieve my heart by some romantic rendering of my troubles—and I gave but little heed to the things he told me.","我那时头脑发热，烦恼与痛苦交织在一起让我发狂。我想向帕罗德袒露心声——至少我希望可以较为浪漫地处理我的麻烦，让内心得到一些解脱——所以我几乎没有在意那时他所告诉我的事情。"
"It was the first time I had heard of this new speck among the countless specks of heaven, and I did not care if I never heard of the thing again.","那是我第一次听说在浩瀚的星海中有这样一颗新星，如果不是后来再一次听说，我是不会留意的。"
"We were two youths much of an age together, Parload was two and twenty, and eight months older than I.","我们俩那时都还年轻，年纪相仿，帕罗德二十二岁，长我八个月。"
"He was—I think his proper definition was “engrossing clerk” to a little solicitor in Overcastle, while I was third in the office staff of Rawdon’s pot-bank in Clayton.","他是——我想对于欧弗卡斯尔的小律师来说，他合适的称呼应该是“迷人的职员”；而那时我是克莱顿罗顿瓷器厂办公室里的“第三号人物”。"
"We had met first in the “Parliament” of the Young Men’s Christian Association of Swathinglea; we had found we attended simultaneous classes in Overcastle, he in science and I in shorthand, and had started a practice of walking home together, and so our friendship came into being.","我们初次见面是在斯瓦辛里青年教会的“议会”上。之后，我们发觉彼此同在欧弗尔卡斯尔读书，他读的是理科而我读的是速记。从那时起，我们就一起步行回家，我们之间的友谊也就这样建立起来了。"
"(Swathinglea, Clayton, and Overcastle were contiguous towns, I should mention, in the great industrial area of the Midlands.) ","（这里我应该提一下的是，斯瓦辛里、克莱顿和欧弗卡斯尔都是中部那个了不起的工业区里相互邻近的城镇。）"
"We had shared each other’s secret of religious doubt, we had confided to one another a common interest in Socialism, he had come twice to supper at my mother’s on a Sunday night, and I was free of his apartment.","我们分享着彼此的秘密——即对宗教的怀疑，向彼此袒露对社会主义的共同兴趣，他曾两次在星期天晚上到我母亲家吃晚饭，我也可以自由出入他的公寓。"
"He was then a tall, flaxen-haired, gawky youth, with a disproportionate development of neck and wrist, and capable of vast enthusiasm; he gave two evenings a week to the evening classes of the organized science school in Overcastle, physiography was his favorite “subject,” and through this insidious opening of his mind the wonder of outer space had come to take possession of his soul.","那时他身材高大，有一头亚麻色的头发，是个有些笨拙的年轻人，脖子和手腕不太成比例，但整个人充满了热情。他每周都抽两个晚上上夜校，去欧弗卡斯尔正规的科技学校读书。自然地理学是他最爱的“科目”，这种学习潜移默化地打开了他的思维，对外太空的好奇开始占据着他的灵魂。"
"He had commandeered an old opera-glass from his uncle who farmed at Leet over the moors, he had bought a cheap paper planisphere and Whitaker’s Almanac, and for a time day and moonlight were mere blank interruptions to the one satisfactory reality in his life—star-gazing.","他从他的叔叔那儿抢来了一副看戏用的旧望远镜。他叔叔在荒原另一边的利特经营农场。他还买了一张便宜的星座图和一本《惠特克年鉴》。在那段时间里，对帕罗德来说，人生中最大的乐事就是观星，白昼和月光都构不成什么影响。"
"It was the deeps that had seized him, the immensities, and the mysterious possibilities that might float unlit in that unplumbed abyss.","正是宇宙的深邃无垠吸引了他。在那片未经探索的深渊里，隐匿着各种神秘的可能。"
"With infinite labor and the help of a very precise article in The Heavens, a little monthly magazine that catered for those who were under this obsession, he had at last got his opera-glass upon the new visitor to our system from outer space.","经过无数次努力，依靠《天国》（一份专门迎合沉迷于此的读者的小月刊）上一篇清晰明确的文章的帮助，他终于用这架看戏用的小望远镜发现了从外太空来到我们太阳系的新客人。"
"He gazed in a sort of rapture upon that quivering little smudge of light among the shining pin-points—and gazed.","他痴迷地凝视着在闪烁的星光中若隐若现的小光点——一动不动。"
"My troubles had to wait for him.","而我的那些麻烦不得不等他有空了再提。"
"“Wonderful,” he sighed, and then as though his first emphasis did not satisfy him, “wonderful!”","“太奇妙了，”他感叹道，之后他似乎觉得第一声赞叹强调得还不够，于是又一次感叹，“太奇妙了！”"
"He turned to me.","他转向我。"
"“Wouldn’t you like to see?”","“你想看看吗？”"
"I had to look, and then I had to listen, how that this scarce-visible intruder was to be, was presently to be, one of the largest comets this world has ever seen, how that its course must bring it within at most—so many score of millions of miles from the earth, a mere step, Parload seemed to think that; how that the spectroscope was already sounding its chemical secrets, perplexed by the unprecedented band in the green, how it was even now being photographed in the very act of unwinding—in an unusual direction—a sunward tail (which presently it wound up again), and all the while in a sort of undertow I was thinking first of Nettie Stuart and the letter she had just written me, and then of old Rawdon’s detestable face as I had seen it that afternoon.","于是我不得不去看一下，然后不得不听他讲述，这颗难得一见的入侵者为什么现在是、以后也会是地球上能看到的最大的一颗彗星，它的轨道是如何保证它在规定的范围内运行的——帕罗德似乎认为，这个范围顶多一步之遥，但这一步却距地球几百万英里；他还跟我解释说，分光镜已经探测到了它的化学秘密，却解释不通绿色光谱里前所未有的光带；他说哪怕在此刻，彗星都正以展开的姿势被人拍摄下来，它以不同寻常的角度展开了一条向阳的彗尾（彗尾此刻又卷了起来）。而在此期间，我一直在回想，我首先想到的就是妮蒂·斯图尔特和她最近给我写的信，接着就是老罗顿那张令人厌恶的脸，就像我那天下午见过的一样。"
"Now I planned answers to Nettie and now belated repartees to my employer, and then again “Nettie” was blazing all across the background of my thoughts....","我开始想应该如何回复妮蒂，如何应付我的老板——我已拖了很久没回复他，接着“妮蒂”再一次占满了我的脑海……"
"Nettie Stuart was daughter of the head gardener of the rich Mr. Verrall’s widow, and she and I had kissed and become sweethearts before we were eighteen years old.","妮蒂·斯图尔特是富裕的维罗尔先生遗孀的大园丁的女儿，我和她在未满18岁时便已一吻定情。"
"My mother and hers were second cousins and old schoolfellows, and though my mother had been widowed untimely by a train accident, and had been reduced to letting lodgings (she was the Clayton curate’s landlady), a position esteemed much lower than that of Mrs. Stuart, a kindly custom of occasional visits to the gardener’s cottage at Checkshill Towers still kept the friends in touch.","我的母亲和她的母亲是远房堂姐妹，也是老同学。尽管我的母亲因一场火车车祸成了寡妇，后来不得不靠出租房子过活（她是克莱顿助理牧师的房东），而且在人们眼里，她的地位远远不如斯图尔特夫人，但她偶尔会去园丁位于切克希利塔楼的小屋做客，这一友善的习惯使这对朋友还保持着联系。"
"Commonly I went with her.","通常我会和她一起去。"
"And I remember it was in the dusk of one bright evening in July, one of those long golden evenings that do not so much give way to night as admit at last, upon courtesy, the moon and a choice retinue of stars, that Nettie and I, at the pond of goldfish where the yew-bordered walks converged, made our shy beginners’ vow.","我记得那是七月一个明亮的黄昏，一个长长的、金色的傍晚，天还没有完全黑下来，还不到月亮静静升起、星光璀璨的时候，我和妮蒂在紫杉小道边的金鱼池旁羞涩地说着我们的初恋誓言。"
"I remember still—something will always stir in me at that memory—the tremulous emotion of that adventure.","我依然记得——一想起这些，就总会有某种悸动——那次经历所带来的令人震颤的感觉。"
"Nettie was dressed in white, her hair went off in waves of soft darkness from above her dark shining eyes; there was a little necklace of pearls about her sweetly modeled neck, and a little coin of gold that nestled in her throat.","当时妮蒂一袭白衣，一头乌黑柔亮的卷发披下来，下面是黑亮的眼睛。她那富有立体感的美妙脖子上挂着一串小巧的珍珠项链，一个小金币在脖子上半隐半现。"
"I kissed her half-reluctant lips, and for three years of my life thereafter—nay! I almost think for all the rest of her life and mine—I could have died for her sake.","我在她的半推半就中吻了她的唇，之后的三年里——不！我几乎觉得在我们的余生中——我都可以为了她去死。"
"You must understand—and every year it becomes increasingly difficult to understand—how entirely different the world was then from what it is now.","你要明白——这一年比一年难懂——当时的世界与现在完全不同。"
"It was a dark world; it was full of preventable disorder, preventable diseases, and preventable pain, of harshness and stupid unpremeditated cruelties, but yet, it may be even by virtue of the general darkness, there were moments of a rare and evanescent beauty that seem no longer possible in my experience.","那时的世界处于一片黑暗中，充斥着本可避免的混乱、疾病和痛苦，充斥着粗暴和愚蠢冒失的残酷行为，但是，也许正是由于这样普遍的黑暗，才有了难得的、短暂的美好时刻，而这些时刻，我似乎已不可能再次经历了。"
"The great Change has come for ever more, happiness and beauty are our atmosphere, there is peace on earth and good will to all men.","巨变已经发生，幸福和美好永远笼罩着我们，地球和平，人人友善。"
"None would dare to dream of returning to the sorrows of the former time, and yet that misery was pierced, ever and again its gray curtain was stabbed through and through by joys of an intensity, by perceptions of a keenness that it seems to me are now altogether gone out of life.","没有人想要回到昔日的伤痛中，但那些苦楚被穿透了，它阴郁的幕帘一次次地被浓烈的快乐戳破，被敏锐的洞察力看穿。在我看来，这种敏锐的洞察力现在已经全然淡出我们的生活了。"
"Is it the Change, I wonder, that has robbed life of its extremes, or is it perhaps only this, that youth has left me—even the strength of middle years leaves me now—and taken its despairs and raptures, leaving me judgment, perhaps, sympathy, memories?","我在想，是不是巨变将生命中的极端剔除了，或者说可能恰恰是因为巨变，我的青春才离我而去——眼下连我中年时的力量都不复存在，还带走了青春的绝望与狂喜，只为我留下结论，抑或是同情和回忆？"
"I cannot tell.","我分不清。"
"One would need to be young now and to have been young then as well, to decide that impossible problem.","只有当下很年轻，并且一直很年轻的人才能解决那个不可能解决的问题。"
"Perhaps a cool observer even in the old days would have found little beauty in our grouping.","也许一个冷静的旁观者即使在旧的时代中，也可以在芸芸众生中找到一点美好。"
"I have our two photographs at hand in this bureau as I write, and they show me a gawky youth in ill-fitting ready-made clothing, and Nettie—Indeed Nettie is badly dressed, and her attitude is more than a little stiff; but I can see her through the picture, and her living brightness and something of that mystery of charm she had for me, comes back again to my mind.","在我写作的这间办公室，我手头有两张照片。照片上是一位笨拙的青年，穿着不合体的成衣，于是，妮蒂——妮蒂穿得的确不怎么好看，她的表情也非常僵硬，但透过照片，我又看到了她，感受到了她的生气勃勃以及令我沉醉的那种神秘的魅力——又出现在我的脑海中。"
"Her face has triumphed over the photographer—or I would long ago have cast this picture away.","她的面容战胜了摄影师——否则我早就把这张照片扔了。"
"The reality of beauty yields itself to no words.","真实的美胜过一切语言。"
"I wish that I had the sister art and could draw in my margin something that escapes description.","我希望我会类似的技术，能用闲暇时间将这无以言表的内容画出来。"
"There was a sort of gravity in her eyes.","她的眼神中有一种庄重。"
"There was something, a matter of the minutest difference, about her upper lip so that her mouth closed sweetly and broke very sweetly to a smile.","她的上嘴唇有一种和别人不同的表情——尽管那差别极为细微，这使得她双唇微闭时十分甜美，露出甜美的微笑。"
"That grave, sweet smile!","那庄重、甜蜜的微笑啊！"
"After we had kissed and decided not to tell our parents for awhile of the irrevocable choice we had made, the time came for us to part, shyly and before others, and I and my mother went off back across the moonlit park—the bracken thickets rustling with startled deer—to the railway station at Checkshill and so to our dingy basement in Clayton, and I saw no more of Nettie—except that I saw her in my thoughts—for nearly a year.","我们接吻了，并决定暂时不把这一不可改变的选择告诉我们的父母，然后就到了分别的时刻。我们当着大家的面，羞答答地告别。我和我的母亲穿过月色蒙眬的公园——受了惊的小鹿跑过，弄得欧洲蕨丛沙沙作响——走回切克希利火车站，回到我们位于克莱顿的昏暗的地下室里。在之后将近一年中，尽管我脑海中满是妮蒂的样子，却再也没见过她。"
"But at our next meeting it was decided that we must correspond, and this we did with much elaboration of secrecy, for Nettie would have no one at home, not even her only sister, know of her attachment.","但我们再次相遇时，我们一致决定要给彼此写信。写信这件事我们做了相当详细的保密工作，因为妮蒂不希望家人——哪怕是她唯一的姐妹——知道她的恋情。"
"So I had to send my precious documents sealed and under cover by way of a confidential schoolfellow of hers who lived near London....","所以我寄信时，不得不把我珍贵的信件封好，再写上她一个同窗密友的地址作掩护，而她这位密友住在伦敦附近……"
"I could write that address down now, though house and street and suburb have gone beyond any man’s tracing.","至今我都记得那个地址，尽管那个郊区、街道和房子现在已面目全非，没有人能找到了。"
"Our correspondence began our estrangement, because for the first time we came into more than sensuous contact and our minds sought expression.","通信让我们之间开始疏远了，因为这是我们第一次开始感官之外的接触，寻求思想上的交流。"
"Now you must understand that the world of thought in those days was in the strangest condition, it was choked with obsolete inadequate formulae, it was tortuous to a maze-like degree with secondary contrivances and adaptations, suppressions, conventions, and subterfuges.","你必须知道，那时候人们的精神世界非常古怪，脑子里塞满了各种老套而不合时宜的程式化观念，复杂得像个迷宫，里面尽是次要的人为设计和改造、对思想的抑制、常规惯例和各种借口。"
"Base immediacies fouled the truth on every man’s lips.","这些基本的需要阻碍了人们讲真话。"
"I was brought up by my mother in a quaint old-fashioned narrow faith in certain religious formulae, certain rules of conduct, certain conceptions of social and political order, that had no more relevance to the realities and needs of everyday contemporary life than if they were clean linen that had been put away with lavender in a drawer.","我母亲相信某些宗教信条、行为准则和某些关于社会政治秩序的观念，我就在这样一种奇怪、过时、狭隘的信念中被带大，这种信念与现实和眼前的日常生活需求没有太大联系，就如它们是干净的亚麻布，跟熏衣草一起被放在一个抽屉里。"
"Indeed, her religion did actually smell of lavender; on Sundays she put away all the things of reality, the garments and even the furnishings of everyday, hid her hands, that were gnarled and sometimes chapped with scrubbing, in black, carefully mended gloves, assumed her old black silk dress and bonnet and took me, unnaturally clean and sweet also, to church.","说真的，她的宗教信仰真的可以嗅到熏衣草的香味。每逢周日，她就会把现实生活的一切放到一边，脱去平日里穿的衣服，甚至是平日的装饰，把她粗糙、因为洗刷有时会皲裂的手藏进她那双精心缝补过的黑色手套里，穿上那件旧黑丝长裙，戴上礼帽。她把我也收拾得异常干净、可爱，然后带着我去教堂。"
"There we sang and bowed and heard sonorous prayers and joined in sonorous responses, and rose with a congregational sigh refreshed and relieved when the doxology, with its opening “Now to God the Father, God the Son,” bowed out the tame, brief sermon.","我们在教堂里唱圣歌、行礼，听人大声诵祷文，然后也跟着大声应和。随着一声“赞颂圣父，赞颂圣子”，牧师开始诵读上帝赞美诗。听着乏味、简单的布道，我们站起身来，发出会众的叹息，感觉精神振作，得到了解脱。"
"There was a hell in that religion of my mother’s, a red-haired hell of curly flames that had once been very terrible; there was a devil, who was also ex officio the British King’s enemy, and much denunciation of the wicked lusts of the flesh; we were expected to believe that most of our poor unhappy world was to atone for its muddle and trouble here by suffering exquisite torments for ever after, world without end, Amen.","在我母亲的宗教世界里，有一个地狱，翻卷着火焰的红发地狱，那地狱曾经极其恐怖。地狱里有一个魔鬼，他的权力和英国国王一样，因邪恶的肉欲而被人们痛骂。教义试图让我们相信，我们这个世界大部分的不幸都是为了通过承受无尽的、极度的痛苦补偿世上的混乱与麻烦。苦海无边，阿门。"
"But indeed those curly flames looked rather jolly.","而事实上，那些翻卷的火焰看上去却很喜庆。"
"The whole thing had been mellowed and faded into a gentle unreality long before my time; if it had much terror even in my childhood I have forgotten it, it was not so terrible as the giant who was killed by the Beanstalk, and I see it all now as a setting for my poor old mother’s worn and grimy face, and almost lovingly as a part of her.","而这一切已渐渐模糊，退化成很久以前的一种柔和的幻象。即使在被我遗忘的童年，这些东西都令我满心恐惧的话，它也不如被宾斯托克杀死的巨人可怕。而如今，我仅仅将这一切看作是烘托我可怜的老母亲那张憔悴、肮脏的脸的背景，而且它几乎变成了她可爱的一部分。"
"And Mr. Gabbitas, our plump little lodger, strangely transformed in his vestments and lifting his voice manfully to the quality of those Elizabethan prayers, seemed, I think, to give her a special and peculiar interest with God.","还有加比塔斯先生，我们家的房客，身材富态，他一穿上牧师袍就像变了一个人似的，还提高了嗓门，很有男子气概，颇似伊丽莎白时代的祈祷者。在我看来，他似乎使母亲对上帝有了特殊、奇特的兴趣。"
"She radiated her own tremulous gentleness upon Him, and redeemed Him from all the implications of vindictive theologians; she was in truth, had I but perceived it, the effectual answer to all she would have taught me.","母亲向上帝表现出了小心翼翼的顺从，使上帝与怀恨在心的神学家们毫无关联。我能感觉出她说的是真话，与她本应教我的确实很吻合。"
"So I see it now, but there is something harsh in the earnest intensity of youth, and having at first taken all these things quite seriously, the fiery hell and God’s vindictiveness at any neglect, as though they were as much a matter of fact as Bladden’s iron-works and Rawdon’s pot-bank, I presently with an equal seriousness flung them out of my mind again.","现在我明白了这个道理，但在年轻气盛有过一些坎坷，因此在一开始，我对这一切都很当真。对于什么地狱烈焰呀，上帝会惩罚一切不敬行为呀，我都以为是事实，就像布莱登铁匠铺里的铁器，罗顿瓷器厂的瓷器一样。而后，我也以同样的严肃态度把这些观念从我的脑子里扔了出去。"
"Mr. Gabbitas, you see, did sometimes, as the phrase went, “take notice” of me, he had induced me to go on reading after I left school, and with the best intentions in the world and to anticipate the poison of the times, he had lent me Burble’s “Scepticism Answered,” and drawn my attention to the library of the Institute in Clayton.","你可以看出，加比塔斯先生有时确实挺……那话怎么说的来着，挺“关注”我的。他曾劝我离开学校后继续读书，告诉我要对世界抱有最美好的希望，同时也要预料到时代的弊病。他曾借给我看伯布的《答怀疑论》，将我的注意力转移到了克莱顿学院的图书馆。"
"The excellent Burble was a great shock to me.","伯布的优秀令我大为震撼。"
"It seemed clear from his answers to the sceptic that the case for doctrinal orthodoxy and all that faded and by no means awful hereafter, which I had hitherto accepted as I accepted the sun, was an extremely poor one, and to hammer home that idea the first book I got from the Institute happened to be an American edition of the collected works of Shelley, his gassy prose as well as his atmospheric verse.","他给怀疑论者的答复中似乎很清楚地说明了一点：说明教义的正统观念的案例、一切渐渐消失的东西，以及一点也不可怕的来生，这些都是极其乏味的。而那时我早已完全接受来生这个概念，就像认定世上有太阳一样。为了更加透彻地理解伯布这本书的思想，我从学院图书馆借的第一本书就是一本美国出版的雪莱选集，收录的是他夸夸其谈的散文和煽情的诗句。"
"I was soon ripe for blatant unbelief.","很快，我就成熟了，明目张胆地不再信仰宗教教义。"
"And at the Young Men’s Christian Association I presently made the acquaintance of Parload, who told me, under promises of the most sinister secrecy, that he was “a Socialist out and out.”","后来我在青年教会上结识了帕罗德，在我发誓一定保守秘密后，他告诉我他是一个“彻头彻尾的社会主义者”。"
"He lent me several copies of a periodical with the clamant title of The Clarion, which was just taking up a crusade against the accepted religion.","那时帕罗德借给了我几本刊物，刊名颇有号召性，叫做《号角》，这本刊物那时正在对人们普遍信仰的宗教发起抨击。"
"The adolescent years of any fairly intelligent youth lie open, and will always lie healthily open, to the contagion of philosophical doubts, of scorns and new ideas, and I will confess I had the fever of that phase badly.","任何有些才气的年轻人在青春期时总会接受、且十分容易接受哲学怀疑论的影响，对别人的蔑视和新观点也都毫无防范。我承认，那时我在那方面表现得十分狂热。"
"Doubt, I say, but it was not so much doubt—which is a complex thing—as startled emphatic denial.","我将之称为怀疑，但它又不是令人震惊的断然否定，怀疑是个挺复杂的概念。"
"“Have I believed THIS!”","“我相信了这个观点！”"
"And I was also, you must remember, just beginning love-letters to Nettie.","你一定还记得，我那时正开始给妮蒂写情书。"
"We live now in these days, when the Great Change has been in most things accomplished, in a time when every one is being educated to a sort of intellectual gentleness, a gentleness that abates nothing from our vigor, and it is hard to understand the stifled and struggling manner in which my generation of common young men did its thinking.","我们现在所处的时代，巨变已经基本完成，人们都被教得温文尔雅，这种温文尔雅并不会妨碍人们活得朝气蓬勃。因此现在的人很难理解我们这一代的普通年轻人压抑、斗争着的思维方式。"
"To think at all about certain questions was an act of rebellion that set one oscillating between the furtive and the defiant.","用这种方式思考某些问题在那时是一种反叛的行为，它会让人在私下议论和公然反抗之间犹豫不决。"
"People begin to find Shelley—for all his melody—noisy and ill conditioned now because his Anarchs have vanished, yet there was a time when novel thought HAD to go to that tune of breaking glass.","现在人们认为雪莱的诗歌听起来嘈杂不堪、不合时宜，那是因为现在已没有他那个时代所特有的混乱状态。然而，在过去的某个时期，新奇的思想“不得不”像玻璃破碎时发出的声音一样。"
"It becomes a little difficult to imagine the yeasty state of mind, the disposition to shout and say, “Yah!” at constituted authority, to sustain a persistent note of provocation such as we raw youngsters displayed.","现在很难想象当时那种思想的动荡，很难想象那种对着既定权威大喊“噢！”的冲动，很难想象，我们当年的那群毛头小子为何要坚持不懈地保持着一股挑衅劲儿。"
"I began to read with avidity such writing as Carlyle, Browning, and Heine have left for the perplexity of posterity, and not only to read and admire but to imitate.","我开始贪婪地阅读卡莱尔、勃朗宁和海因那些为了给后代解惑而写的作品。我不仅阅读、欣赏，还要模仿他们的写法。"
"My letters to Nettie, after one or two genuinely intended displays of perfervid tenderness, broke out toward theology, sociology, and the cosmos in turgid and startling expressions.","我给妮蒂的信中，仅有一两次刻意地表达了我极度的柔情，而之后则开始转向神学、社会学以及宇宙学的话题，信中充满了浮夸而惊人的字眼。"
"No doubt they puzzled her extremely.","不用说，这些信让她十分不解。"
"I retain the keenest sympathy and something inexplicably near to envy for my own departed youth, but I should find it difficult to maintain my case against any one who would condemn me altogether as having been a very silly, posturing, emotional hobbledehoy indeed and quite like my faded photograph.","我对我已逝的青春有着强烈的同情和一种几乎是嫉妒的、莫名其妙的情愫。但我应认识到，我很难以自己为例去应对所有想谴责我的人——我曾经就是一个极其愚蠢、装腔作势、感情用事的笨小伙子，就像我那张褪了色的照片一样。"
"And when I try to recall what exactly must have been the quality and tenor of my more sustained efforts to write memorably to my sweetheart, I confess I shiver... ","我试着回忆，我曾坚持不懈地写给我亲爱的妮蒂的那些值得纪念的信里到底写了什么，我不得不承认，这时我都会颤抖……"
"Yet I wish they were not all destroyed.","但我依然希望这些信没有全部被毁掉。"
"Her letters to me were simple enough, written in a roundish, unformed hand and badly phrased.","她写给我的信相当简单。她的字迹圆润而稚嫩，措辞则有些不成句。"
"Her first two or three showed a shy pleasure in the use of the word “dear,” and I remember being first puzzled and then, when I understood, delighted, because she had written “Willie ASTHORE” under my name.","在她给我的前两三封信中，她用了“亲爱的”这个词，带着一种羞涩的愉悦。我记得起初我对此很迷惑，弄明白后便十分高兴，因为她在我的名字下写了“ASTHORE威利”。"
"“Asthore,” I gathered, meant “darling.”","我那时猜想，“asthore”应该就是“亲爱的”的意思。"
"But when the evidences of my fermentation began, her answers were less happy.","但当我开始表现出激动情绪时，她的回应却不如以往热烈了。"
"I will not weary you with the story of how we quarreled in our silly youthful way, and how I went the next Sunday, all uninvited, to Checkshill, and made it worse, and how afterward I wrote a letter that she thought was “lovely,” and mended the matter.","我不会再讲这些事烦你们了，比如我们曾经有过怎样幼稚而愚蠢的争吵，比如下个星期天我又怎样成了切克希利的不速之客，让情况变得更糟，比如之后我又怎样写了一封让她觉得很“优美”的信而把事情摆平。"
"Nor will I tell of all our subsequent fluctuations of misunderstanding.","我也不想再讲述误会后的种种波折。"
"Always I was the offender and the final penitent until this last trouble that was now beginning; and in between we had some tender near moments, and I loved her very greatly.","一直都是我先冒犯她，最后总是我向她悔过——直到我们最后一次闹僵，这时这次矛盾已初露端倪。我们之间曾有过充满柔情的亲密时刻，我也曾非常爱她。"
"There was this misfortune in the business, that in the darkness, and alone, I thought with great intensity of her, of her eyes, of her touch, of her sweet and delightful presence, but when I sat down to write I thought of Shelley and Burns and myself, and other such irrelevant matters.","这件事的不幸之处就在于：在黑暗中，或独处时，我会深切地思念她，想念她的双眼，想念她的抚摸，想念她甜美、可人的模样；但每当我坐下来写信的时候，我却总会想起雪莱、彭斯，想起我自己以及其他一些不相干的事情。"
"When one is in love, in this fermenting way, it is harder to make love than it is when one does not love at all.","当一个人坠入爱河，并且如此躁动时，就比没有爱情时更难做爱。"
"And as for Nettie, she loved, I know, not me but those gentle mysteries.","而对于妮蒂而言，我知道，她爱的不是我，而是那些温和的宗教教义。"
"It was not my voice should rouse her dreams to passion... ","能唤起她激情之梦的不是我的声音……"
"So our letters continued to jar.","所以我们在信中仍然冲突不断。"
"Then suddenly she wrote me one doubting whether she could ever care for any one who was a Socialist and did not believe in Church, and then hard upon it came another note with unexpected novelties of phrasing.","突然有一天，她在信中告诉我，她不确定自己是否真的会爱一个社会主义者、一个不相信基督的人，紧接着她又给我写了一个便条，措辞相当新颖，出人意料。"
"She thought we were not suited to each other, we differed so in tastes and ideas, she had long thought of releasing me from our engagement.","她觉得我们并不适合彼此，我们在品味和观点上有着太大的差异，她说她早就想把我从我们的关系中解放出来了。"
"In fact, though I really did not apprehend it fully at the first shock, I was dismissed.","尽管起初我震惊不已，无法完全明白她的意思，但事实上，我被甩了。"
"Her letter had reached me when I came home after old Rawdon’s none too civil refusal to raise my wages.","我的加薪请求被老罗顿严词拒绝了，回到家中，又收到了她的分手信。"
"On this particular evening of which I write, therefore, I was in a state of feverish adjustment to two new and amazing, two nearly overwhelming facts, that I was neither indispensable to Nettie nor at Rawdon’s.","因此，在我所写的那天晚上，我心潮澎湃，在两种新奇的、惊人的、几乎令人不知所措的事实中调整着自己，即无论对于妮蒂还是罗顿而言，我都不是不可缺少的那个人。"
"And to talk of comets!","还谈什么彗星啊！"
"Where did I stand?","我站在哪里？"
"I had grown so accustomed to think of Nettie as inseparably mine—the whole tradition of “true love” pointed me to that—that for her to face about with these precise small phrases toward abandonment, after we had kissed and whispered and come so close in the little adventurous familiarities of the young, shocked me profoundly.","我已经习惯将妮蒂看作是我不可分割的一部分——整个“真爱”的传统让我这样想。我们曾拥吻过，我们曾私语过，我们曾像所有年轻人一样在冒险的亲昵行为中如此亲密，但现在她让我面对这些明确地要将我抛弃的词汇，这让我无比震惊。"
"I!","我！"
"I!","我！"
"And Rawdon didn’t find me indispensable either.","而罗顿并不觉得我不可或缺。"
"I felt I was suddenly repudiated by the universe and threatened with effacement, that in some positive and emphatic way I must at once assert myself.","我突然觉得自己被整个宇宙遗弃了，我面临从这个地球上消失的威胁，所以我必须立刻以积极的、引人注意的方式维护我自己。"
"There was no balm in the religion I had learnt, or in the irreligion I had adopted, for wounded self-love.","而在我所学过的宗教知识中，或者我坚持的无宗教观点中，我都找不到什么慰藉能治疗我受伤的自爱之心。"
"Should I fling up Rawdon’s place at once and then in some extraordinary, swift manner make the fortune of Frobisher’s adjacent and closely competitive pot-bank?","我是否应该立刻逃离罗顿的工厂，然后以惊人的速度迅速跳到邻近的、作为竞争对手的弗罗比舍瓷器厂发大财？"
"The first part of that program, at any rate, would be easy of accomplishment, to go to Rawdon and say, “You will hear from me again,” but for the rest, Frobisher might fail me.","无论如何，那个计划的第一部分都比较容易完成，我可以过去对罗顿说：“你以后还会有我的消息的，再见。”但关于剩下的计划，弗罗比舍也许根本不会要我。"
"That, however, was a secondary issue.","不过那已是次要的事了。"
"The predominant affair was with Nettie.","最重要的事情莫过于我和妮蒂的感情。"
"I found my mind thick-shot with flying fragments of rhetoric that might be of service in the letter I would write her.","我发觉我的脑海中充斥着转瞬即逝的只言片语，而这些话也许就是我给她的信中所能用到的。"
"Scorn, irony, tenderness—what was it to be?","挖苦、嘲笑、温柔——到底是什么？"
"“Brother!” said Parload, suddenly.","“兄弟！”帕罗德突然喊我。"
"“What?” said I.","“什么事？”我问。"
"“They’re firing up at Bladden’s iron-works, and the smoke comes right across my bit of sky.”","“他们正在布莱登的铁匠铺生火，烟已经弥漫到我这边来了。”"
"The interruption came just as I was ripe to discharge my thoughts upon him.","我正打算向他倾诉我的想法的时候，却被他一句话打断了。"
"“Parload,” said I, “very likely I shall have to leave all this.","“帕罗德，”我对他说，“我很可能不得不放弃这一切。"
"Old Rawdon won’t give me a rise in my wages, and after having asked I don’t think I can stand going on upon the old terms anymore.","老罗顿拒绝给我加薪，这一请求被拒绝后，我想我无法继续忍受原有的待遇了。"
"See?","你明白了么？"
"So I may have to clear out of Clayton for good and all.”","因此我可能不得不离开克莱顿，永远离开。”"
"Section 3","第三节"
"That made Parload put down the opera-glass and look at me.","我的一席话让帕罗德放下他的观剧望远镜，转而望着我。"
"“It’s a bad time to change just now,” he said after a little pause.","“现在可不是个换工作的好时候。”他顿了顿，对我说。"
"Rawdon had said as much, in a less agreeable tone.","罗顿也曾经讲过同样的话，不过语气就没这么好了。"
"But with Parload I felt always a disposition to the heroic note.","但和帕罗德在一起时，我说话总会有种英雄主义的调调。"
"“I’m tired,” I said, “of humdrum drudgery for other men.","“我累了，”我说，“我已经厌倦了为别人做单调的苦工。"
"One may as well starve one’s body out of a place as to starve one’s soul in one.”","饿其体肤让人离开一个地方，就如饿其灵魂让人的肉体与灵魂结为一体一样。”"
"“I don’t know about that altogether,” began Parload, slowly....","“我不懂你在说些什么。”帕罗德慢吞吞地开了腔。"
"And with that we began one of our interminable conversations, one of those long, wandering, intensely generalizing, diffusely personal talks that will be dear to the hearts of intelligent youths until the world comes to an end.","而后我们就此展开了没完没了的谈话。那是一场冗长的、漫无主题的、极其平常的、絮絮叨叨的私人谈话，但对那些有想法的年轻人来说，在世界末日到来之前，那却算得上是一次珍贵的交谈。"
"The Change has not abolished that, anyhow.","不管怎样，巨变没有摧毁这次谈话。"
"It would be an incredible feat of memory for me now to recall all that meandering haze of words, indeed I recall scarcely any of it, though its circumstances and atmosphere stand out, a sharp, clear picture in my mind.","如今，回忆起那些已经模糊、漫无主题的闲谈可以说是我记忆力的惊人表现，实际上，我几乎什么也记不起来了。可当时谈话的场景和气氛依然历历在目，在我脑中形成清晰鲜明的画面。"
"I posed after my manner and behaved very foolishly no doubt, a wounded, smarting egotist, and Parload played his part of the philosopher preoccupied with the deeps.","我按自己的习惯摆出一副受了伤、痛苦的自大狂的样子——无疑表现得很愚蠢。而帕罗德则是一副哲学家的样子，满心都是深奥的哲理。"
"We were presently abroad, walking through the warm summer’s night and talking all the more freely for that.","我们当时正在异乡，走在温暖的夏夜里，自由自在地畅谈。"
"But one thing that I said I can remember.","但我记得我说过的一件事。"
"“I wish at times,” said I, with a gesture at the heavens, “that comet of yours or some such thing would indeed strike this world—and wipe us all away, strikes, wars, tumults, loves, jealousies, and all the wretchedness of life!”","“有时候我希望，”我说道，手指向天空，“你所说的彗星或者其他什么类似的东西能撞上地球，把那些罢工、战争、喧嚣、爱情、嫉妒和生活中的一切不幸统统清理掉！”"
"“Ah!” said Parload, and the thought seemed to hang about him.","“啊！”帕罗德说，然后这个念头似乎就在他脑海中打转。"
"“It could only add to the miseries of life,” he said irrelevantly, when presently I was discoursing of other things.","“但这只能增添生活的痛苦，”他答非所问地说道，而我已将话题转移了。"
"“What would?”","“什么会增添痛苦？”"
"“Collision with a comet.","“跟彗星相撞。"
"It would only throw things back.","那只会将物体反弹回来。"
"It would only make what was left of life more savage than it is at present.”","那只能让残存的生命比现在更加野蛮。”"
"“But why should ANYTHING be left of life?” said I....","“可为什么还会有残留的生命？”我说……"
"That was our style, you know, and meanwhile we walked together up the narrow street outside his lodging, up the stepway and the lanes toward Clayton Crest and the high road.","你看，这就是我们之间的谈话方式。我们就这样一边交谈，一边一起走向他住处外的狭窄街道，走上通往克莱顿峰顶和公路的台阶和小巷。"
"But my memories carry me back so effectually to those days before the Change that I forget that now all these places have been altered beyond recognition, that the narrow street and the stepway and the view from Clayton Crest, and indeed all the world in which I was born and bred and made, has vanished clean away, out of space and out of time, and wellnigh out of the imagination of all those who are younger by a generation than I.","但我的记忆还是准确无误地把我带回了巨变之前的时光，我已全然忘记巨变前的种种，而那些地方现在也难以辨认。那些狭窄的街道、有台阶的小径、克莱顿峰顶的景色——实际上我出生、成长的那整个世界——已经全然消失了，在时间和空间中无迹可寻，甚至连我下一代的那些人都几乎无法想象了。"
"You cannot see, as I can see, the dark empty way between the mean houses, the dark empty way lit by a bleary gas-lamp at the corner, you cannot feel the hard checkered pavement under your boots, you cannot mark the dimly lit windows here and there, and the shadows upon the ugly and often patched and crooked blinds of the people cooped within.","你无法看到我所能看得见的那些简房陋舍之间漆黑的、空荡荡的小道，小道的角落里燃着一盏昏暗的煤气灯，你感受不到脚下坚硬的格纹人行道，看不见四下里昏暗灯光映照下的一扇扇窗，也看不见难看、打满补丁、变了形的窗帘上的阴影，那是被束缚在里头的人用的窗帘。"
"Nor can you presently pass the beerhouse with its brighter gas and its queer, screening windows, nor get a whiff of foul air and foul language from its door, nor see the crumpled furtive figure—some rascal child—that slinks past us down the steps.","你此刻不能从灯光明亮、有着奇怪纱窗的啤酒屋前经过，也闻不到门口那股污浊的气味，听不到那些污言秽语，也看不到那些弯着腰鬼鬼祟祟的身影——那是一些淘气的小孩子悄悄从我们身边跑下台阶。"
"We crossed the longer street, up which a clumsy steam tram, vomiting smoke and sparks, made its clangorous way, and adown which one saw the greasy brilliance of shop fronts and the naphtha flares of hawkers’ barrows dripping fire into the night.","我们穿过长长的街道，街道上蒸汽机车喷着烟尘、闪着火星缓缓开过，发出叮叮当当的声响。沿街是油得发亮的店铺门面和黑夜里小商贩手推车上闪烁的油灯光亮。"
"A hazy movement of people swayed along that road, and we heard the voice of an itinerant preacher from a waste place between the houses.","影影绰绰的人群沿着街流动，游吟传教士的布道声从房屋之间的空地上传入我们的耳中。"
"You cannot see these things as I can see them, nor can you figure—unless you know the pictures that great artist Hyde has left the world—the effect of the great hoarding by which we passed, lit below by a gas-lamp and towering up to a sudden sharp black edge against the pallid sky.","你无法看到这些我可以看到的东西，若非了解伟大的艺术家海德的传世之作，你也无法想象我们经过的大型广告牌所产生的影响。广告牌赫然耸立，下面燃着一盏煤气灯，给苍白的夜空镶上了一道突兀的黑边。"
"Those hoardings!","那些广告牌啊！"
"They were the brightest colored things in all that vanished world.","它们是已逝世界里最亮丽的色彩。"
"Upon them, in successive layers of paste and paper, all the rough enterprises of that time joined in chromatic discord; pill vendors and preachers, theaters and charities, marvelous soaps and astonishing pickles, typewriting machines and sewing machines, mingled in a sort of visualized clamor.","广告牌上一层层地糊满了糨糊和纸，那时的各种杂七杂八的行当都加入到这个混乱的调色盘里来了：烟贩子、传教士、剧院、慈善团体、极好的香皂和惊人的泡菜、打字机以及缝纫机……林林总总的广告语交错在一起，形成了一种视觉上的喧嚣。"
"And passing that there was a muddy lane of cinders, a lane without a light, that used its many puddles to borrow a star or so from the sky.","走过那儿之后，是一条煤渣铺成的泥泞的小路，一路没有灯光，只有许多水洼映着天上的星光。"
"We splashed along unheeding as we talked.","我们一边聊天，一边心不在焉地踏着泥水向前走。"
"Then across the allotments, a wilderness of cabbages and evil-looking sheds, past a gaunt abandoned factory, and so to the high road.","之后，我们穿过配给的土地、一片卷心菜地、一片不堪入目的简房陋舍，经过一个已荒芜废弃的厂房，走向公路。"
"The high road ascended in a curve past a few houses and a beerhouse or so, and round until all the valley in which four industrial towns lay crowded and confluent was overlooked.","公路蜿蜒着经由几间房舍和一家啤酒屋，盘旋而上，直到俯瞰整个山谷。山谷里四个熙攘的工业小镇融合在一起。"
"I will admit that with the twilight there came a spell of weird magnificence over all that land and brooded on it until dawn.","我必须承认，从暮色降临开始，那里就有一种古怪的壮丽景象，它笼罩着这片土地，直到黎明到来。"
"The horrible meanness of its details was veiled, the hutches that were homes, the bristling multitudes of chimneys, the ugly patches of unwilling vegetation amidst the makeshift fences of barrel-stave and wire.","它可怕、丑陋的细节被蒙上了一层面纱，还有那些破旧棚屋搭建的家，那些林立的烟筒，那些用原木和铁丝临时搭设的栅栏，栅栏之间疯长出的植被形成了难看的疤痕。"
"The rusty scars that framed the opposite ridges where the iron ore was taken and the barren mountains of slag from the blast furnaces were veiled; the reek and boiling smoke and dust from foundry, pot-bank, and furnace, transfigured and assimilated by the night.","赭色的疤痕形成两条相对的垄，那里蕴含着丰富的铁矿。鼓风炉里排出的炉渣形成了贫瘠的山包，在夜里像是蒙了一层纱，模糊可见。铸造厂、瓷器厂和鼓风炉里冒出滚滚烟尘，在黑夜里扭曲着身姿，最后隐没不见。"
"The dust-laden atmosphere that was gray oppression through the day became at sundown a mystery of deep translucent colors, of blues and purples, of somber and vivid reds, of strange bright clearnesses of green and yellow athwart the darkling sky.","白日里，空气中尘土飞扬，周围都笼罩在一种灰蒙蒙的压抑感之中，而到了傍晚，这种灰色变成了一种神秘而半透明的深色、蓝紫相间的颜色、或明或暗的红色，还有一道奇异的黄绿色的清光划过逐渐变黑的天空。"
"Each upstart furnace, when its monarch sun had gone, crowned itself with flames, the dark cinder heaps began to glow with quivering fires, and each pot-bank squatted rebellious in a volcanic coronet of light.","无上的太阳王下山之后，每个耸立的鼓风炉开始用火光为自己加冕，黑色的煤渣堆也开始闪着跳跃的火星，各个瓷器厂在火山般的火光中反抗似的立在那里。"
"The empire of the day broke into a thousand feudal baronies of burning coal.","一时间，白日的帝国溃然崩塌，燃煤成了掌权的贵族。"
"The minor streets across the valley picked themselves out with gas-lamps of faint yellow, that brightened and mingled at all the principal squares and crossings with the greenish pallor of incandescent mantles and the high cold glare of the electric arc.","穿过这片凹地的是一条条小巷，它们用一盏盏昏黄的汽灯昭示着自己的存在。汽灯的昏黄、灯罩的暗绿和电弧光冰冷的白色就这样相互交织在各个中心广场和十字路口。"
"The interlacing railways lifted bright signal-boxes over their intersections, and signal stars of red and green in rectangular constellations.","纵横交错的铁轨交叉口赫然矗立着明亮的信号箱，红色和绿色的信号灯光在在长方形的灯座里闪烁，像是迷离的星光一样。"
"The trains became articulated black serpents breathing fire.","火车像是铰接的黑色巨蟒，吞吐着火舌。"
"Moreover, high overhead, like a thing put out of reach and near forgotten, Parload had rediscovered a realm that was ruled by neither sun nor furnace, the universe of stars.","此外，帕罗德还在头顶之上发现了一个差不多被人遗忘的、遥不可及的由繁星组成的王国，那里没有壁炉、没有太阳照耀。"
"This was the scene of many a talk we two had held together.","这就是我和帕罗德那时一起谈话时的一个场景。"
"And if in the daytime we went right over the crest and looked westward there was farmland, there were parks and great mansions, the spire of a distant cathedral, and sometimes when the weather was near raining, the crests of remote mountains hung clearly in the sky.","如果是在白天，我们就会登到峰顶，向西俯瞰农场、公园、广厦和远处教堂的尖顶。有时在雨水来临之际，还可以清晰地看到远方群山的山尖在天边映现。"
"Beyond the range of sight indeed, out beyond, there was Checkshill; I felt it there always, and in the darkness more than I did by day.","而我们视线所不能及的地方，就是切克希利了。我总能感觉它一直就在那儿，这种感觉在晚上要比在白天强烈得多。"
"Checkshill, and Nettie!","切克希利，还有妮蒂！"
"And to us two youngsters as we walked along the cinder path beside the rutted road and argued out our perplexities, it seemed that this ridge gave us compendiously a view of our whole world.","对我们两个年轻人而言，我们一边在带着车辙的公路旁的煤渣小道上散步，一边对于我们的困惑争论不休，这条小道似乎为我们展开了一幅整个世界的简图。"
"There on the one hand in a crowded darkness, about the ugly factories and work-places, the workers herded together, ill clothed, ill nourished, ill taught, badly and expensively served at every occasion in life, uncertain even of their insufficient livelihood from day to day, the chapels and churches and public-houses swelling up amidst their wretched homes like saprophytes amidst a general corruption, and on the other, in space, freedom, and dignity, scarce heeding the few cottages, as overcrowded as they were picturesque, in which the laborers festered, lived the landlords and masters who owned pot-banks and forge and farm and mine.","在那里，一方面，在那拥挤的黑暗中，在那些简陋的工厂和工地上，工人们拉帮结伙、衣衫褴褛、面黄肌瘦、目不识丁。生活中处处都要花钱，处处都会遭受白眼，每天吃了上顿没下顿。礼拜堂、教堂和酒馆在他们破旧不堪的房子之间林立，像是一大片腐烂的东西中长出的腐生植物。而另一方面，在一些地方，那自由和尊严难得光顾的几个村舍拥挤不堪，却也风景如画。工人们在这里怨声载道，地主和主人们却乐得清闲，他们拥有着瓷器厂、铁匠铺、农场以及矿井。"
"Far away, distant, beautiful, irrelevant, from out of a little cluster of secondhand bookshops, ecclesiastical residences, and the inns and incidentals of a decaying market town, the cathedral of Lowchester pointed a beautiful, unemphatic spire to vague incredible skies.","远处，基督教住宅区在一片二手书店中隐现，建筑结构优美，远离尘嚣，与一切互不干扰。透过各种酒馆林立的衰落的集镇，罗切斯特大教堂华美而柔和的塔尖指向模糊而不可思议的天空。"
"So it seemed to us that the whole world was planned in those youthful first impressions.","因此在我们眼中，整个世界似乎就是在人们生机勃勃的第一印象中规划好了的。"
"We saw everything simple, as young men will.","我们和其他年轻人一样，把事情看得很简单。"
"We had our angry, confident solutions, and whosoever would criticize them was a friend of the robbers.","我们有我们年轻气盛而自信满满的解决方式，谁敢对我们的方案横加干涉指手画脚，那么那个人就是“强盗的朋友”。"
"It was a clear case of robbery, we held, visibly so; there in those great houses lurked the Landlord and the Capitalist, with his scoundrel the Lawyer, with his cheat the Priest, and we others were all the victims of their deliberate villainies.","对我们来说，这很明显就是抢劫案。那些在高楼大厦里隐藏着地主和资本家，他们有着自己的地痞律师，有专门骗人的牧师，而我们都是他们蓄意犯罪的受害人。"
"No doubt they winked and chuckled over their rare wines, amidst their dazzling, wickedly dressed women, and plotted further grinding for the faces of the poor.","毋庸置疑，他们花天酒地，纸醉金迷，在莺歌燕语中肆意欢谑，却仍然企图进一步压榨贫困的劳动人民。"
"And amidst all the squalor on the other hand, amidst brutalities, ignorance, and drunkenness, suffered multitudinously their blameless victim, the Working Man.","而另一方面，在这些污秽、残忍、无知和酗酒中，劳动人民成了一切暴行的无辜受害者。"
"And we, almost at the first glance, had found all this out, it had merely to be asserted now with sufficient rhetoric and vehemence to change the face of the whole world.","而我们几乎一眼就将这一切看穿了。如今要改变世界的面貌，我们只需用恰当的言辞和力度表达出来即可。"
"The Working Man would arise—in the form of a Labor Party, and with young men like Parload and myself to represent him—and come to his own, and then—?","广大的劳动人民将以工党的名义站起来反抗，代表就是我和帕罗德这样的年轻人，我们要为自己而活，但然后呢——？"
"Then the robbers would get it hot, and everything would be extremely satisfactory.","然后那些强盗们就会怒发冲冠，然后一切就会变得让人非常满意。"
"Unless my memory plays me strange tricks that does no injustice to the creed of thought and action that Parload and I held as the final result of human wisdom.","除非我的记忆在跟我开什么奇怪的玩笑，否则将我和帕罗德的思想和行为准则视为人类智慧的最终结晶绝不会有失公允。"
"We believed it with heat, and rejected with heat the most obvious qualification of its harshness.","我们坚信这样做是正确的，也坚决反对任何批评的声音。"
"At times in our great talks we were full of heady hopes for the near triumph of our doctrine, more often our mood was hot resentment at the wickedness and stupidity that delayed so plain and simple a reconstruction of the order of the world.","在我们之前的长谈中，我们不时也会对我们的信念所取得的最新成绩而满怀希望。更多时候里，我们会对邪恶和愚昧愤愤不平，我们认为正是这种愚昧和邪恶彻底耽误了世界秩序的重建。"
"Then we grew malignant, and thought of barricades and significant violence.","我们也起过恶意的念头，想设置障碍，也想过引起暴动。"
"I was very bitter, I know, upon this night of which I am now particularly telling, and the only face upon the hydra of Capitalism and Monopoly that I could see at all clearly, smiled exactly as old Rawdon had smiled when he refused to give me more than a paltry twenty shillings a week.","我知道就在我正在讲述的这个夜晚，我处于巨大的痛苦之中，我能清楚地看到资本主义和垄断主义祸害的嘴脸在向我露出狰狞的笑脸，那笑脸和老罗顿每周付我二十先令并拒绝为我加薪时的笑脸一模一样。"
"I wanted intensely to salve my self-respect by some revenge upon him, and I felt that if that could be done by slaying the hydra, I might drag its carcass to the feet of Nettie, and settle my other trouble as well.","我热切渴望用某种报复的方式赎回我的自尊，我感觉如果可以用铲除祸害的方式报复的话，我就可以把它的残骸拖到妮蒂脚边，这也就解决了我的另一件烦恼。"
"“What do you think of me NOW, Nettie?”","“现在你觉得我怎么样，妮蒂？”"
"That at any rate comes near enough to the quality of my thinking, then, for you to imagine how I gesticulated and spouted to Parload that night.","那无论如何都相当接近我真正的想法了。这样，你可以想象，我那晚上是如何手舞足蹈地跟帕罗德夸夸其谈的。"
"You figure us as little black figures, unprepossessing in the outline, set in the midst of that desolating night of flaming industrialism, and my little voice with a rhetorical twang protesting, denouncing....","你可以把我们想象成两个小黑影，那轮廓并不讨喜，我们坐在蒸蒸日上的工业主义的寂静的夜色里，我用微弱的、带着夸张的鼻音的声音在抗议，在谴责……"
"You will consider those notions of my youth poor silly violent stuff; particularly if you are of the younger generation born since the Change you will be of that opinion.","你会觉得我年轻时的想法都是些乏味、愚昧而暴力的东西，如果你是巨变后出生的年轻一代，你就更会有这种想法了。"
"Nowadays the whole world thinks clearly, thinks with deliberation, pellucid certainties, you find it impossible to imagine how any other thinking could have been possible.","现在整个世界的想法都已变得明晰，人们的思想已变得周全、清晰而坚定，你会觉得产生其他见解是件无法想象的事情。"
"Let me tell you then how you can bring yourself to something like the condition of our former state.","那我得先告诉你如何才能进入与我们之前的思想状态相似的环境。"
"In the first place you must get yourself out of health by unwise drinking and eating, and out of condition by neglecting your exercise, then you must contrive to be worried very much and made very anxious and uncomfortable, and then you must work very hard for four or five days and for long hours every day at something too petty to be interesting, too complex to be mechanical, and without any personal significance to you whatever.","首先，你要先用胡吃海喝的方式搞垮你的健康，用疏于锻炼的方法让身体发福。然后你要想方设法让自己过度焦虑、难以宽心。之后你要连续在高压下没日没夜地工作四五天，每日长时间关注那些了无趣味、复杂得只能手工操作、且对你毫无意义的事情。"
"This done, get straightway into a room that is not ventilated at all, and that is already full of foul air, and there set yourself to think out some very complicated problem.","做完这些之后，直接去一间完全不通风、充斥着臭气的房间里，在里面思考一些复杂的问题。"
"In a very little while you will find yourself in a state of intellectual muddle, annoyed, impatient, snatching at the obvious presently in choosing and rejecting conclusions haphazard.","过不了多久，你就会发现自己处于一种思维混乱、烦躁、焦急的状态中了，显然，这是只能杂乱无章地做出选择和排斥一些结论。"
"Try to play chess under such conditions and you will play stupidly and lose your temper.","在这种情况下下棋，你会下得很糟糕，直到最后大发脾气。"
"Try to do anything that taxes the brain or temper and you will fail.","如果你尝试去做任何需要脑力或者耐力的事情，你会一事无成。"
"Now, the whole world before the Change was as sick and feverish as that, it was worried and overworked and perplexed by problems that would not get stated simply, that changed and evaded solution, it was in an atmosphere that had corrupted and thickened past breathing; there was no thorough cool thinking in the world at all.","现在你知道了吧，巨变之前整个世界都处于如此一种病态的狂躁状态，那些说不清道不明的、不断变化且无法解决的问题困扰着人们，让人们过度疲劳、困惑不已。那时的整个世界都处于一种腐败的、浑浊的气氛之中，根本没有人冷静地思考。"
"There was nothing in the mind of the world anywhere but half-truths, hasty assumptions, hallucinations, and emotions.","那时的世界上就只有半真半假、草率的假设、幻想，还有冲动的情绪，除此之外一无所有。"
"Nothing....","一无所有……"
"I know it seems incredible, that already some of the younger men are beginning to doubt the greatness of the Change our world has undergone, but read—read the newspapers of that time.","我知道这好像不可思议，很多年轻人正开始怀疑我们这个世界所经历的巨变的伟大性，但请读一读当时的报纸。"
"Every age becomes mitigated and a little ennobled in our minds as it recedes into the past.","当回顾历史时，每个时代在我们的意识中都变得平和甚至有些崇高。"
"It is the part of those who like myself have stories of that time to tell, to supply, by a scrupulous spiritual realism, some antidote to that glamour.","而怀着一丝不苟的现实主义的态度去讲述那个时代的故事，并矫正那种被夸张了的魅力，则是像我这样的人的职责。"
"Section 4","第四节"
"Always with Parload I was chief talker.","和帕罗德在一起时，话多的那个人总是我。"
"I can look back upon myself with, I believe, an almost perfect detachment, things have so changed that indeed now I am another being, with scarce anything in common with that boastful foolish youngster whose troubles I recall.","我想，我可以用一种近乎完美的超然态度回顾曾经的自己。时过境迁，我也确实不再是曾经的自己，不再是那个什么事都觉得新奇的自负的愣头青。但我还记得他曾经的烦恼。"
"I see him vulgarly theatrical, egotistical, insincere, indeed I do not like him save with that instinctive material sympathy that is the fruit of incessant intimacy.","我看到他逢场作戏、自我中心、虚情假意，我确实不喜欢他。但我有着本能的同情心——那是长期亲密相处的结果。"
"Because he was myself I may be able to feel and write understandingly about motives that will put him out of sympathy with nearly every reader, but why should I palliate or defend his quality?","因为他就是我自己，我也许能感受并能谅解地写出他丧失同情的动机，几乎每位读者都有同情心的，而我为何要对此加以掩饰或是为他的品行辩护呢？"
"Always, I say, I did the talking, and it would have amazed me beyond measure if any one had told me that mine was not the greater intelligence in these wordy encounters.","如上面所说，一般都是我在讲话。如果有人告诉我，在这些言语交锋中我的水准还不够的话，我会吃惊不已的。"
"Parload was a quiet youth, and stiff and restrained in all things, while I had that supreme gift for young men and democracies, the gift of copious expression.","帕罗德是个安静的年轻人，性格比较呆板，做任何事情都放不开。而我却有着许多年轻人和民主主义者的天赋，那就是丰富的表达能力。"
"Parload I diagnosed in my secret heart as a trifle dull; he posed as pregnant quiet, I thought, and was obsessed by the congenial notion of “scientific caution.”","我内心深处认为帕罗德有些乏味呆板，故作深沉，我觉得他是被那些“科学的告诫”之类的东西弄得头脑发昏了。"
"I did not remark that while my hands were chiefly useful for gesticulation or holding a pen Parload’s hands could do all sorts of things, and I did not think therefore that fibers must run from those fingers to something in his brain.","我并不是说我的双手就是用来打手势或是写东西的，而帕罗德的手就是什么都能做的。我也并不因此认为纤维就能绕过他的手然后绕进他的大脑中。"
"Nor, though I bragged perpetually of my shorthand, of my literature, of my indispensable share in Rawdon’s business, did Parload lay stress on the conics and calculus he “mugged” in the organized science school.","尽管我常对于我的速记和学识自吹自擂，说我对于罗顿的生意来说不可或缺，但帕罗德却从未显摆过他在严格的科技学校里“醉心”学习的圆锥曲线和微积分知识。"
"Parload is a famous man now, a great figure in a great time, his work upon intersecting radiations has broadened the intellectual horizon of mankind for ever, and I, who am at best a hewer of intellectual wood, a drawer of living water, can smile, and he can smile, to think how I patronized and posed and jabbered over him in the darkness of those early days.","帕罗德现在是个名人了，是那个伟大时代里的伟大人物。他在交叉辐射方面的著作大大拓宽了人类知识的视野。而我不过是智慧树林里的伐木者，生命之水的运水人。他现在可以嘲笑我了，想想我在当年那些昏暗的日子里在他面前是如何的屈尊纡贵、装腔作势、滔滔不绝的。"
"That night I was shrill and eloquent beyond measure.","那晚我失控了，尖叫不止，夸夸其谈。"
"Rawdon was, of course, the hub upon which I went round—Rawdon and the Rawdonesque employer and the injustice of “wages slavery” and all the immediate conditions of that industrial blind alley up which it seemed our lives were thrust.","罗顿很自然地成了我关注的中心。罗顿、罗顿式的雇主、不公平的“工资奴役”，和所有工业社会死胡同的当下形势，这一切都是我的话题。"
"But ever and again I glanced at other things.","但我也时不时地想起一些其他的事情。"
"Nettie was always there in the background of my mind, regarding me enigmatically.","妮蒂不停地在我脑中出现，用不可捉摸的眼神望着我。"
"It was part of my pose to Parload that I had a romantic love-affair somewhere away beyond the sphere of our intercourse, and that note gave a Byronic resonance to many of the nonsensical things I produced for his astonishment.","这段远超出我们之间交情的浪漫爱情故事也是我在帕罗德面前装腔作势的内容之一。我故意用一种让他惊讶的语气讲述这些事情，对很多荒谬的事情产生了一种拜伦式的共鸣。"
"I will not weary you with too detailed an account of the talk of a foolish youth who was also distressed and unhappy, and whose voice was balm for the humiliations that smarted in his eyes.","我不会再喋喋不休地跟你叨叨与一个愚蠢年轻人谈话的细节，以及这个年轻人的苦闷和郁郁寡欢，他的嗓音对他所看到的羞耻来说，不失为一种良药。"
"Indeed, now in many particulars I cannot disentangle this harangue of which I tell from many of the things I may have said in other talks to Parload.","确确实实，现在在很多细节上，就连我自己也无法将我的这种高谈阔论和我与帕罗德在其他交谈中说的事情区分开。"
"For example, I forget if it was then or before or afterwards that, as it were by accident, I let out what might be taken as an admission that I was addicted to drugs.","比如，我记不起我何时无意中说过那些可能会让人误以为我是瘾君子的话，是在这次谈话中，还是在此之前或者是在此之后呢？"
"“You shouldn’t do that,” said Parload, suddenly.","“你不应该那么做，”帕罗德突然说，"
"“It won’t do to poison your brains with that.”","“用毒品麻痹大脑是没用的。”"
"My brains, my eloquence, were to be very important assets to our party in the coming revolution....","我的大脑和我雄辩的口才在即将来临的革命中对我们的党来说都是极为重要的财富……"
"But one thing does clearly belong to this particular conversation I am recalling.","但我回忆起有一件事的确是属于这次特别的谈话的。"
"When I started out it was quite settled in the back of my mind that I must not leave Rawdon’s.","当我开始这次长谈时，我心中已经决定，我并不一定要离开罗顿那里。"
"I simply wanted to abuse my employer to Parload.","我只不过想在帕罗德面前将我的雇主痛骂一顿而已。"
"But I talked myself quite out of touch with all the cogent reasons there were for sticking to my place, and I got home that night irrevocably committed to a spirited—not to say a defiant—policy with my employer.","但我越说越离谱了，完全说不出令人信服我的观点的理由。那天晚上我回到家里，不可挽回地制定了一个英勇的（不要说是反抗的）关于雇主的计划。"
"“I can’t stand Rawdon’s much longer,” I said to Parload by way of a flourish.","“我在罗顿那儿再也呆不下去了。”我情绪激动地对帕罗德说。"
"“There’s hard times coming,” said Parload.","“艰难的日子就要来了。”帕罗德说。"
"“Next winter.”","“明年冬天。”"
"“Sooner.","“快了。"
"The Americans have been overproducing, and they mean to dump.","美国人一直生产过剩，他们将会倾销。"
"The iron trade is going to have convulsions.”","钢铁贸易马上会出现骚乱。“"
"“I don’t care.","“不关我事。"
"Pot-banks are steady.”","瓷器店的生意很稳定。”"
"“With a corner in borax?","“还在囤积硼砂？"
"No. I’ve heard—”","不。我听说——”"
"“What have you heard?”","“你听说什么？”"
"“Office secrets.","“办公室机密。"
"But it’s no secret there’s trouble coming to potters.","但如果陶工出了问题，这也就算不上什么机密了。"
"There’s been borrowing and speculation.","借贷和投机一直没停止过。"
"The masters don’t stick to one business as they used to do.","老板们不会像以前一样死守一笔买卖。"
"I can tell that much.","我敢打包票。"
"Half the valley may be ‘playing’ before two months are out.”","有可能在两个月内，半条山谷的人都要‘玩儿’去了。”"
"Parload delivered himself of this unusually long speech in his most pithy and weighty manner.","帕罗德以他最简练、最强有力的方式发表了这少见的长篇大论。"
"“Playing” was our local euphemism for a time when there was no work and no money for a man, a time of stagnation and dreary hungry loafing day after day.","“玩儿”是我们这里流行一时的委婉语，意思是一个人没工作也没钱的日子，或者是生产停滞、萎靡不振、食不果腹、整天游荡的状态。"
"Such interludes seemed in those days a necessary consequence of industrial organization.","在那时，这种插曲似乎是工业社会的必然产物。"
"“You’d better stick to Rawdon’s,” said Parload.","“你最好呆在罗顿那里。”帕罗德说。"
"“Ugh,” said I, affecting a noble disgust.","“呸！”我装作厌恶地说。"
"“There’ll be trouble,” said Parload.","“不然会出问题的。”帕罗德说道。"
"“Who cares?”","“谁在乎？”"
"said I.","我说，"
"“Let there be trouble—the more the better.","“有麻烦又怎样——多多益善。"
"This system has got to end, sooner or later.","这个体制迟早会结束的。"
"These capitalists with their speculation and corners and trusts make things go from bad to worse.","资本家连同他们的投机买卖还有他们囤积的货物让这个体制每况愈下。"
"Why should I cower in Rawdon’s office, like a frightened dog, while hunger walks the streets?","在饥饿横行的时候，凭什么要我像条受惊的丧家犬一样躲在罗顿的办公室里？"
"Hunger is the master revolutionary.","饥饿是革命大师。"
"When he comes we ought to turn out and salute him.","当他光临时我们应该转而向他致敬。"
"Anyway, I’M going to do so now.”","不管怎样，这就是我现在想做的。”"
"“That’s all very well,” began Parload.","“那非常好。”帕罗德开始说道。"
"“I’m tired of it,” I said.","“我已经厌倦了。”我说，"
"“I want to come to grips with all these Rawdons.","“我想要和所有‘罗顿’们干一仗。"
"I think perhaps if I was hungry and savage I could talk to hungry men—”","我想，如果我食不果腹，并且还野蛮粗俗的话，是可以跟饥民们谈的——”"
"“There’s your mother,” said Parload, in his slow judicial way.","“但你母亲也在其中。”帕罗德慢条斯理地说。"
"That WAS a difficulty.","那确实是个麻烦事儿。"
"I got over it by a rhetorical turn.","但我依然在言辞上绕过了这关。"
"“Why should one sacrifice the future of the world—why should one even sacrifice one’s own future—because one’s mother is totally destitute of imagination?”","“难道一个人就要因为他母亲完全失去了想象力，而牺牲世界的未来、甚至牺牲他自己的未来吗？”"
"Section 5","第五节"
"It was late when I parted from Parload and came back to my own home.","我和帕罗德分开，回到家里时已经很晚了。"
"Our house stood in a highly respectable little square near the Clayton parish church.","我们的房子在克莱顿教区教堂附近的一个颇为人尊敬的小广场上。"
"Mr. Gabbitas, the curate of all work, lodged on our ground floor, and upstairs there was an old lady, Miss Holroyd, who painted flowers on china and maintained her blind sister in an adjacent room; my mother and I lived in the basement and slept in the attics.","加比塔斯先生住在我们这幢房屋的一楼，他是一位代理牧师，基本上什么活儿都接，牧师楼上住着一位老姑娘，名叫霍尔罗伊德小姐，她专门在瓷器上画花，以此抚养住在隔壁的盲人妹妹；我和母亲日常生活地下室，在顶楼休息。"
"The front of the house was veiled by a Virginian creeper that defied the Clayton air and clustered in untidy dependant masses over the wooden porch.","房子正面爬满了弗吉尼亚爬山虎，这爬山虎不畏惧克莱顿污浊的空气，在木门廊上团成凌乱的一束垂吊开来。"
"As I came up the steps I had a glimpse of Mr. Gabbitas printing photographs by candle light in his room.","我上台阶时，瞥见加比塔斯先生正在烛光下冲洗照片。"
"It was the chief delight of his little life to spend his holiday abroad in the company of a queer little snap-shot camera, and to return with a great multitude of foggy and sinister negatives that he had made in beautiful and interesting places.","带着一部形状奇怪的小傻瓜相机出国度假，然后带回他在那些美丽而有趣的地方拍摄的大量模糊不清的底片，那是他乏味生活中主要乐趣。"
"These the camera company would develop for him on advantageous terms, and he would spend his evenings the year through in printing from them in order to inflict copies upon his undeserving friends.","其实相机公司可以以优惠的价格为他冲洗照片的，但他宁可终年把晚上的时间浪费在洗照片上，之后再拿这些照片去跟他的狐朋狗友显摆。"
"There was a long frameful of his work in the Clayton National School, for example, inscribed in old English lettering, “Italian Travel Pictures, by the Rev. E. B. Gabbitas.”","例如，克莱顿公立学校里有一排长长的镜框，里面全是他的摄影作品，上面用老式英文印刷体写着“意大利旅游照片，由E.B.加比塔斯牧师拍摄。”"
"For this it seemed he lived and traveled and had his being.","似乎这样才能表示他生活过、旅游过、是个人物一样。"
"It was his only real joy.","这是他唯一的真正的乐趣。"
"By his shaded light I could see his sharp little nose, his little pale eyes behind his glasses, his mouth pursed up with the endeavor of his employment.","透过昏暗的光线，我可以看到他小而尖的鼻子、镜片后无神的小眼睛和他职业性撅起的嘴。"
"“Hireling Liar,” I muttered, for was not he also part of the system, part of the scheme of robbery that made wages serfs of Parload and me?—though his share in the proceedings was certainly small.","“海尔金·利尔。”我轻声这样说道，并不是因为他也是这个体系的一员，是用工资奴役帕罗德和我的强盗体制中的一员——尽管他很少参与这些诉讼活动。"
"“Hireling Liar,” said I, standing in the darkness, outside even his faint glow of traveled culture...","“海尔金·利尔。”我站在黑暗中，甚至站在他黯淡的旅游文化的光环中说……"
"My mother let me in.","我母亲给我开了门，进到屋里。"
"She looked at me, mutely, because she knew there was something wrong and that it was no use for her to ask what.","她默默地看着我，因为她知道出事了，也知道就算问也是无济于事的。"
"“Good night, mummy,” said I, and kissed her a little roughly, and lit and took my candle and went off at once up the staircase to bed, not looking back at her.","“晚安，妈妈。”我说着，匆匆吻了一下她，然后端起点燃的蜡烛，立刻去楼上睡觉，不再回头看她。"
"“I’ve kept some supper for you, dear.”","“亲爱的，我为你留了晚饭。”"
"“Don’t want any supper.”","“不想吃了。”"
"“But, dearie—”","“但是，亲爱的——”"
"“Good night, mother,” and I went up and slammed my door upon her, blew out my candle, and lay down at once upon my bed, lay there a long time before I got up to undress.","“晚安，妈妈。”我走上楼去，“砰”的一声把她关在门外，吹熄蜡烛，随即便躺上床，过了很久才起身脱衣服。"
"There were times when that dumb beseeching of my mother’s face irritated me unspeakably.","母亲脸上露出的默默的请求常让我有一种无法言说的怒气。"
"It did so that night.","那天晚上就是这样。"
"I felt I had to struggle against it, that I could not exist if I gave way to its pleadings, and it hurt me and divided me to resist it, almost beyond endurance.","我觉得自己必须克服这种感觉，觉得如果让我向这种感觉妥协，我就像要活不下去了一样。这种感觉让我心疼，将我分裂开而让我去反抗，几乎让我无法忍受。"
"It was clear to me that I had to think out for myself religious problems, social problems, questions of conduct, questions of expediency, that her poor dear simple beliefs could not help me at all—and she did not understand!","我清楚地知道，我必须认真考虑我的宗教问题、社会问题、品行问题以及相应的权宜之计。我知道母亲她那可怜、热切而简单的信仰帮不了我什么——可这一点，她却不懂！"
"Hers was the accepted religion, her only social ideas were blind submissions to the accepted order—to laws, to doctors, to clergymen, lawyers, masters, and all respectable persons in authority over us, and with her to believe was to fear.","她的信仰是大众认可的宗教，她唯一的社会思想就是盲从约定俗成的秩序——遵从法律、医生、牧师、律师、名人以及高于我们的尊敬的权威人士，对她来说，信仰等同于敬畏。"
"She knew from a thousand little signs—though still at times I went to church with her—that I was passing out of touch of all these things that ruled her life, into some terrible unknown.","尽管我有时还会陪她去教堂，但她已经从无数蛛丝马迹中察觉到我正在逐渐摒弃这些统治她生活的东西，并进入某种令她恐惧的陌生状态。"
"From things I said she could infer such clumsy concealments as I made.","她可以从我的言语中察觉出我如此拙劣的掩饰。"
"She felt my socialism, felt my spirit in revolt against the accepted order, felt the impotent resentments that filled me with bitterness against all she held sacred.","她能感受到我所信仰的社会主义，感受到我来自灵魂深处的对现有制度的反感，感受到我发自内心地对她所信奉的一切教义的愤恨和无能为力。"
"Yet, you know, it was not her dear gods she sought to defend so much as me!","但你要知道，她想要保护的不是她敬爱的神灵，而是我！"
"She seemed always to be wanting to say to me, “Dear, I know it’s hard—but revolt is harder.","她似乎总想对我说：“孩子，我知道接受这一切很难——但反抗会更难。"
"Don’t make war on it, dear—don’t!","不要制造冲突，我亲爱的孩子，千万不要！"
"Don’t do anything to offend it.","不要做任何反抗现有秩序的事情。"
"I’m sure it will hurt you if you do—it will hurt you if you do.”","我敢肯定，一旦你做出那样的事情，你一定会受到伤害的——真的，你那样做会受伤的。”"
"She had been cowed into submission, as so many women of that time had been, by the sheer brutality of the accepted thing.","她和当时无数妇女一样，逆来顺受惯了，习惯默默忍受那些既有现实的残酷。"
"The existing order dominated her into a worship of abject observances.","现有的秩序控制着她，使得她对那些卑劣的教义推崇有加。"
"It had bent her, aged her, robbed her of eyesight so that at fifty-five she peered through cheap spectacles at my face, and saw it only dimly, filled her with a habit of anxiety, made her hands—Her poor dear hands!","那些教义使她变得屈从、苍老，并且蛮横地剥夺了她的视力，让她在55岁的年龄就不得不借助廉价的老花镜来凝视我的面孔，而且还看得模模糊糊，她已经焦虑成习，动辄就摩挲着双手——那双历经风霜的手啊！"
"Not in the whole world now could you find a woman with hands so grimy, so needle-worn, so misshapen by toil, so chapped and coarsened, so evilly entreated....","在现在，你满世界也无法再找到那样一双手了：满是污垢、到处是被针线磨过的痕迹、因长期劳作而变得有些畸形、皲裂粗糙、骨节粗大，更不要提什么保养……"
"At any rate, there is this I can say for myself, that my bitterness against the world and fortune was for her sake as well as for my own.","无论如何，至少关于这一点我可以说，我对世界和未来的痛苦反抗，不仅仅是为了我自己，也是为了她。"
"Yet that night I pushed by her harshly.","但那晚，她严厉地逼问着我。"
"I answered her curtly, left her concerned and perplexed in the passage, and slammed my door upon her.","我给了她一个简略的答复，而后摔门离开，留她在走廊里担心、不解。"
"And for a long time I lay raging at the hardship and evil of life, at the contempt of Rawdon, and the loveless coolness of Nettie’s letter, at my weakness and insignificance, at the things I found intolerable, and the things I could not mend.","很长一段时间，我都躺在床上恼怒不已，因为生活的艰辛困苦、罗顿的轻蔑辱骂，妮蒂来信的缺乏爱情和冰冷无情、我的弱小和微不足道、我无法容忍的事情以及我无法修复的事情。"
"Over and over went my poor little brain, tired out and unable to stop on my treadmill of troubles.","这些琐事反反复复地在我可怜的脑海中浮现，使我筋疲力竭，而且无法阻止这些源源不断的麻烦。"
"Nettie.","妮蒂。"
"Rawdon.","罗顿。"
"My mother.","我的母亲。"
"Gabbitas.","加比塔斯。"
"Nettie...","妮蒂……"
"Suddenly I came upon emotional exhaustion.","刹那间，我的感情消耗殆尽。"
"Some clock was striking midnight.","不知何处敲起了午夜的钟声。"
"After all, I was young; I had these quick transitions.","毕竟，我还年轻，我已经经历了快速的转变。"
"I remember quite distinctly, I stood up abruptly, undressed very quickly in the dark, and had hardly touched my pillow again before I was asleep.","我清楚地想起了这些，于是我从床上一跃而起，在黑夜里迅速脱掉了衣服，倒头便睡。"
"But how my mother slept that night I do not know.","但我不知道，那天夜里我的母亲是如何入睡的。"
"Oddly enough, I do not blame myself for behaving like this to my mother, though my conscience blames me acutely for my arrogance to Parload.","奇怪的是，尽管那时我常因为对帕罗德傲慢无礼而感到良心不安，但我却没有因为如此粗暴地对待我的母亲而觉得自责。"
"I regret my behavior to my mother before the days of the Change, it is a scar among my memories that will always be a little painful to the end of my days, but I do not see how something of the sort was to be escaped under those former conditions.","而现在，我对巨变前对母亲的态度而悔恨不已，那已经成为我记忆中的一块伤疤，令我痛苦一生。但我却不知道，在那样的情况下，该如何才能避免这种事情的发生。"
"In that time of muddle and obscurity people were overtaken by needs and toil and hot passions before they had the chance of even a year or so of clear thinking; they settled down to an intense and strenuous application to some partial but immediate duty, and the growth of thought ceased in them.","在那种糊里糊涂、昏昏暗暗的时刻，人们往往臣服于需求、辛劳和炽热的激情，根本没有机会——哪怕仅是花一年时间冷静思考，这样他们便可以安定下来，认真承担部分直接责任，不再想入非非。"
"They set and hardened into narrow ways.","他们被那些狭隘的思维方式所禁锢。"
"Few women remained capable of a new idea after five and twenty, few men after thirty-one or two.","女人到了25岁、男人到了31或32岁之后，就很少有能接受新思想的了。"
"Discontent with the thing that existed was regarded as immoral, it was certainly an annoyance, and the only protest against it, the only effort against that universal tendency in all human institutions to thicken and clog, to work loosely and badly, to rust and weaken towards catastrophes, came from the young—the crude unmerciful young.","不满于现实的人常被认为道德败坏，这无疑是件令人懊恼的事情。人类社会机制的普遍趋势就是机构臃肿、人浮于事、机能衰退、面临摧毁性的危险。而唯一能对此做出反抗努力的，就只有年轻人——那些被认为是鲁莽而无情的年轻人。"
"It seemed in those days to thoughtful men the harsh law of being—that either we must submit to our elders and be stifled, or disregard them, disobey them, thrust them aside, and make our little step of progress before we too ossified and became obstructive in our turn.","在当时那些有思想的人看来，这一切似乎都是严苛的秩序现实——我们要么绝对服从长辈，压抑自己的思想，要么就无视他们，绝不服从，对他们置之不理，在我们尚未被旧的秩序禁锢的时候一点点向前进，以免最后也沦落到阻碍后辈进步的境地。"
"My pushing past my mother, my irresponsive departure to my own silent meditations, was, I now perceive, a figure of the whole hard relationship between parents and son in those days.","现在我终于明白，我母亲当年对我的逼迫以及我对自己沉默反思的不负责任的背离，说到底都是当时两辈人之间关系紧张的一个缩影。"
"There appeared no other way; that perpetually recurring tragedy was, it seemed, part of the very nature of the progress of the world.","似乎别无他法，悲剧的重演似乎就是世界进程的一部分。"
"We did not think then that minds might grow ripe without growing rigid, or children honor their parents and still think for themselves.","我们当时并不认为人的理智未经僵化就会成熟起来，或者说孩子在尊重父母意见的同时仍然可以有自己的想法。"
"We were angry and hasty because we stifled in the darkness, in a poisoned and vitiated air.","我们之所以会愤怒、会焦躁，是因为我们一直被抑制在黑暗中，抑制在有毒的、满是污秽的空气里。"
"That deliberate animation of the intelligence which is now the universal quality, that vigor with consideration, that judgment with confident enterprise which shine through all our world, were things disintegrated and unknown in the corrupting atmosphere of our former state.","人们理解力中那种刻意的活跃（如今已相当普遍）、那种深思熟虑的活力、那种自信满满、进取心十足的判断力（这种自信心和进取心现在处处都是）在我们先前那种充斥着腐朽的氛围中都是破碎不堪、不为人知的。"
"(So the first fascicle ended.","（至此，第一分册结束。"
"I put it aside and looked for the second.","我把它放在一边，寻找第二册。"
"“Well?”","“怎么样？”"
"said the man who wrote.","写书的人问。"
"“This is fiction?”","“这是小说吗？”"
"“It’s my story.”","“这是我的故事。”"
"“But you—Amidst this beauty—You are not this ill-conditioned, squalidly bred lad of whom I have been reading?”","“可你——在这些美好的事物中——你应该不是我刚才读的那个没有教养、品行不端的人吧？”"
"He smiled.","他笑了笑。"
"“There intervenes a certain Change,” he said.","“这中间是经历了一些巨变。”他说道，"
"“Have I not hinted at that?”","“我没有暗示过这一点吗？”"
"I hesitated upon a question, then saw the second fascicle at hand, and picked it up.)","我对这个问题犹犹豫豫，接着看见手边的第二分册，便把它拿了起来。）"

"Chapter the Second","第二章"
"Nettie","妮蒂"
"Section 1","第一节"
"I CANNOT now remember (the story resumed), what interval separated that evening on which Parload first showed me the comet—I think I only pretended to see it then—and the Sunday afternoon I spent at Checkshill.","我现在已经记不起（故事重新开始了）帕罗德第一次指给我看彗星的那晚和我在切克希利度过的那个星期天的下午之间相隔了多长时间了，我觉得那晚我只是假装看见了彗星。"
"Between the two there was time enough for me to give notice and leave Rawdon’s, to seek for some other situation very strenuously in vain, to think and say many hard and violent things to my mother and to Parload, and to pass through some phases of very profound wretchedness.","在这两件事之间，我本有足够的时间去通知罗顿然后离开他的瓷器厂、去全力以赴却徒劳地去找寻其他工作、去对我的母亲和帕罗德说一些无情而偏激的话以及发表一些意义深远而令人沮丧的观点。"
"There must have been a passionate correspondence with Nettie, but all the froth and fury of that has faded now out of my memory.","我和妮蒂之间一定有过一次极富感情的通信，但信中的那些空谈和激情已经在我的记忆里变模糊了。"
"All I have clear now is that I wrote one magnificent farewell to her, casting her off forever, and that I got in reply a prim little note to say, that even if there was to be an end to everything, that was no excuse for writing such things as I had done, and then I think I wrote again in a vein I considered satirical.","我清楚地记得，我曾给她写过一封措辞颇为华丽的绝情信，要与从此她一刀两断。还记得我曾收到过一张字体端正的字条，上面说，即使一切皆休，也没有任何理由写出那些绝情的话来。之后我又用自认为是讽刺的笔调给她去了一封信。"
"To that she did not reply.","她没有再回复我。"
"That interval was at least three weeks, and probably four, because the comet which had been on the first occasion only a dubious speck in the sky, certainly visible only when it was magnified, was now a great white presence, brighter than Jupiter, and casting a shadow on its own account.","这期间至少隔了三周，或者是四周的时间，因为彗星第一次出现时就是天空中一颗模糊不清、位置不定的斑点，需要放大才能看见，现在却成了一个巨大的白色天体，比木星还要明亮，并因其自身投下一片阴影。"
"It was now actively present in the world of human thought, every one was talking about it, every one was looking for its waxing splendor as the sun went down—the papers, the music-halls, the hoardings, echoed it.","那时彗星常常出现在人们的脑海中，成了人们大肆讨论的对象。每个人都期待日落后看到更加明亮壮丽的彗星。彗星的消息不断地出现在报纸、音乐厅和张贴栏中。"
"Yes; the comet was already dominant before I went over to make everything clear to Nettie.","是的，我还没来得及向妮蒂解释清楚这一切，彗星便已经占据了我的大脑。"
"And Parload had spent two hoarded pounds in buying himself a spectroscope, so that he could see for himself, night after night, that mysterious, that stimulating line—the unknown line in the green.","帕罗德还花了他好不容易攒下来的两英镑买下了一架望远镜，以便自己每夜亲自观测那个神秘而又激动人心的轮廓——那个绿色背景下的未知轮廓。"
"How many times I wonder did I look at the smudgy, quivering symbol of the unknown things that were rushing upon us out of the inhuman void, before I rebelled?","我不知问过自己多少次，在我对此心生厌恶之前，我到底有没有认真观测过那个未知的、模糊的、颤动的东西？"
"But at last I could stand it no longer, and I reproached Parload very bitterly for wasting his time in “astronomical dilettantism.”","但我最终还是无法忍受这东西，因此我言辞激烈地谴责帕罗德，责怪他把时间都浪费在“对天文学的业余爱好”上了。"
"“Here,” said I.","“你看，”我说，"
"“We’re on the verge of the biggest lock-out in the history of this countryside; here’s distress and hunger coming, here’s all the capitalistic competitive system like a wound inflamed, and you spend your time gaping at that damned silly streak of nothing in the sky!”","“我们正经历着几乎是这个村子有史以来最大的封厂。贫困和饥饿正在袭来，资本主义的一切竞争机制都是化脓感染的伤口，而你却还要浪费光阴在观测天空中这该死的、愚蠢的、虚无的东西上！”"
"Parload stared at me.","帕罗德望着我。"
"“Yes, I do,” he said slowly, as though it was a new idea.","“没错，我就是这么做的。”他不紧不慢地说，似乎说的是一个新的想法，"
"“Don’t I?...","“难道不是吗？"
"I wonder why.”","我也在想我为什么会这样做。”"
"“I want to start meetings of an evening on Howden’s Waste.”","“我想找一天晚上在‘豪登的荒野’办一个聚会。”"
"“You think they’d listen?”","“你以为他们会听你的？”"
"“They’d listen fast enough now.”","“他们很快就会听的。”"
"“They didn’t before,” said Parload, looking at his pet instrument.","“他们之前可没理会过你。”帕罗德望着他心爱的仪器说。"
"“There was a demonstration of unemployed at Swathinglea on Sunday.","“星期天失业者在斯沃星利游行。"
"They got to stone throwing.”","他们还扔了石头。”"
"Parload said nothing for a little while and I said several things.","帕罗德一时间没再说话，然后我又说了几件事。"
"He seemed to be considering something.","他似乎在思考一些事情。"
"“But, after all,” he said at last, with an awkward movement towards his spectroscope, “that does signify something.”","“但毕竟，”他向望远镜艰难地走了一步，终于开口说道，“它却是说明了一些事情。”"
"“The comet?”","“彗星？”"
"“Yes.”","“没错。”"
"“What can it signify?","“它能说明什么？"
"You don’t want me to believe in astrology.","别指望我相信占星术。"
"What does it matter what flames in the heavens—when men are starving on earth?”","就算天上圣火激情燃烧，它和地上的人食不果腹能有什么关系？”"
"“It’s—it’s science.”","“它是——它是科学。”"
"“Science!","“科学！"
"What we want now is socialism—not science.”","我们现在想要的是社会主义，不是科学。”"
"He still seemed reluctant to give up his comet.","他似乎依然不愿意放弃他的彗星。"
"“Socialism’s all right,” he said, “but if that thing up there WAS to hit the earth it might matter.”","“社会主义是没错，”他说，“但是，如果彗星撞上了地球，事情就严重了。”"
"“Nothing matters but human beings.”","“除了人类，其他什么都无足轻重。”"
"“Suppose it killed them all.”","“你想想，如果彗星撞了地球，人类就不复存在了。”"
"“Oh,” said I, “that’s Rot,”","“哎，”我说，“荒谬。”"
"“I wonder,” said Parload, dreadfully divided in his allegiance.","“我对此保留意见。”帕罗德的神情所表露出的忠诚颇令人敬畏。"
"He looked at the comet.","他凝望着彗星。"
"He seemed on the verge of repeating his growing information about the nearness of the paths of the earth and comet, and all that might ensue from that.","他似乎又要反反复复地讲起他所得到的有关地球与彗星轨道接近的越来越多的消息，以及因此可能产生的后果。"
"So I cut in with something I had got out of a now forgotten writer called Ruskin, a volcano of beautiful language and nonsensical suggestions, who prevailed very greatly with eloquent excitable young men in those days.","因此我赶忙插话打断了他，说起了我从拉斯金作品中读到的一些事情。拉斯金是一位已经被人遗忘的作家，他语言优美、妙语连珠，也提出了一些荒谬的建议，他再当年那些雄辩的、头脑冲动的年轻人中间还是很流行的。"
"Something it was about the insignificance of science and the supreme importance of Life.","同时我还讲了一些科学无关紧要、生命高于一切的言论。"
"Parload stood listening, half turned towards the sky with the tips of his fingers on his spectroscope.","帕罗德伫立倾听，半侧着身子面向天空，指尖放在望远镜上。"
"He seemed to come to a sudden decision.","他似乎在猛然间做出了决定。"
"“No. I don’t agree with you, Leadford,” he said.","“不，我不同意你的观点，利德福特，”他说，"
"“You don’t understand about science.”","“你根本不懂什么是科学。”"
"Parload rarely argued with that bluntness of opposition.","帕罗德很少如此直率地反对别人。"
"I was so used to entire possession of our talk that his brief contradiction struck me like a blow.","我已如此习惯我们谈话中一边倒的现象了，他简单的反驳对我来说无疑是当头棒喝。"
"“Don’t agree with me!”","“你不同意我的观点！”"
"I repeated.","我重复道。"
"“No,” said Parload","“是的，我不同意。”帕罗德说。"
"“But how?”","“怎么可能呢？”"
"“I believe science is of more importance than socialism,” he said.","“我认为科学远比社会主义重要。”他说道，"
"“Socialism’s a theory.","“社会主义只是一种理论。"
"Science—science is something more.”","而科学则不仅仅是理论。”"
"And that was really all he seemed to be able to say.","他能讲出来的似乎也就只有这么多了。"
"We embarked upon one of those queer arguments illiterate young men used always to find so heating.","我们争论的话题颇为古怪，无知的年轻人们曾经总觉得这些话题激动人心。"
"Science or Socialism?","选择科学还是社会主义？"
"It was, of course, like arguing which is right, left handedness or a taste for onions, it was altogether impossible opposition.","当然，这就好像在问左撇子和爱吃洋葱哪个是正确的，完全是风马牛不相及的两件事儿。"
"But the range of my rhetoric enabled me at last to exasperate Parload, and his mere repudiation of my conclusions sufficed to exasperate me, and we ended in the key of a positive quarrel.","但我的言辞最终还是激怒了帕罗德，不过他彻底否认我的结论，也足以使我发火，于是我们只好就此作罢。"
"“Oh, very well!”","“算了！”"
"said I.","我说，"
"“So long as I know where we are!”","“只要我们自己明白是怎样就可以了！”"
"I slammed his door as though I dynamited his house, and went raging down the street, but I felt that he was already back at the window worshiping his blessed line in the green, before I got round the corner.","我摔门离开，那感觉就像是我炸了他的房子。我怒气冲冲地跑到大街上，可我能感觉到，还没等我转过街角，他就已经回到窗前，继续膜拜那神圣绿色背景中的那个轮廓了。"
"I had to walk for an hour or so, before I was cool enough to go home.","我在街上徘徊了一个小时左右才平静下来，然后走回家去。"
"And it was Parload who had first introduced me to socialism!","第一次向我介绍社会主义的人还是帕罗德！"
"Recreant!","叛徒！"
"The most extraordinary things used to run through my head in those days.","在那些日子里，我脑中常常浮现出一些颇为反常的事情。"
"I will confess that my mind ran persistently that evening upon revolutions after the best French pattern, and I sat on a Committee of Safety and tried backsliders.","我承认，我晚上经常想模拟法国这一最佳模式展开革命活动，我自己则在安全委员会里任职，企图开倒车。"
"Parload was there, among the prisoners, backsliderissimus, aware too late of the error of his ways.","帕罗德已沦为囚犯的一员，他意识到了自己思想的错误，但为时已晚。"
"His hands were tied behind his back ready for the shambles; through the open door one heard the voice of justice, the rude justice of the people.","他的双手被绑在背后，正准备赴刑。审判的声音穿过敞开的大门传来，那是对人民粗暴无礼的宣判。"
"I was sorry, but I had to do my duty.","我为此深表遗憾，但我必须恪守职责。"
"“If we punish those who would betray us to Kings,” said I, with a sorrowful deliberation, “how much the more must we punish those who would give over the State to the pursuit of useless knowledge”; and so with a gloomy satisfaction sent him off to the guillotine.","“假如我们惩罚那些在国王面前出卖我们的人，”我用悲痛而庄严的语气说，“那我们得惩罚多少那些把国家交给追求毫无用处的知识的人呢？”而后，带着一丝阴郁的满意，我把他送上了断头台。"
"“Ah, Parload!","“哎，帕罗德！"
"Parload!","帕罗德！"
"If only you’d listened to me earlier, Parload.”..","如果你当初听我的该多好啊，帕罗德。”"
"None the less that quarrel made me extremely unhappy.","不用说，那次争论让我很不高兴。"
"Parload was my only gossip, and it cost me much to keep away from him and think evil of him with no one to listen to me, evening after evening.","可帕罗德是我唯一可以谈天的朋友，我费了好大工夫才尽量疏远他，想他的不是，但从此再也没有人做我的倾听者了，夜复一夜，每天都是如此。"
"That was a very miserable time for me, even before my last visit to Checkshill.","对我来说，那是一段难熬的日子，甚至在我最后一次去切克希利前就已经开始了。"
"My long unemployed hours hung heavily on my hands.","长期的失业让我心情凝重。"
"I kept away from home all day, partly to support a fiction that I was sedulously seeking another situation, and partly to escape the persistent question in my mother’s eyes.","我整天在外游荡。一方面，这让我看似正在坚持不懈地谋求另一份职业；另一方面，这也让我得以逃过母亲眼中无尽的疑问。"
"“Why did you quarrel with Mr. Rawdon?","“你为什么会跟罗顿先生吵起来呢？"
"Why DID you?","为什么？"
"Why do you keep on going about with a sullen face and risk offending IT more?","为什么整天板着脸郁郁寡欢？这样会更糟糕的。”"
"I spent most of the morning in the newspaper-room of the public library, writing impossible applications for impossible posts—I remember that among other things of the sort I offered my services to a firm of private detectives, a sinister breed of traders upon base jealousies now happily vanished from the world, and wrote apropos of an advertisement for “stevedores” that I did not know what the duties of a stevedore might be, but that I was apt and willing to learn—and in the afternoons and evenings I wandered through the strange lights and shadows of my native valley and hated all created things.","我大半个上午都呆在公共图书馆的报刊阅览室里，写那些不切实际的申请，申请一些不可能被录用的职位——我还记得在所有我申请中，有一份是写给一家私人侦探公司的，那是一种建立在嫉妒与猜忌基础上的险恶职业，好在现在这个职业已经不复存在了。我还为“搬运工”量身定做了一个广告，尽管我连搬运工该做什么都不清楚，但我愿意学——到了下午和晚上，我就在家附近陌生的灯光和黑影里徘徊，厌恶所有人造之物。"
"Until my wanderings were checked by the discovery that I was wearing out my boots.","直到我发觉靴子都已经磨烂了，我才停止到处乱逛。"
"The stagnant inconclusive malaria of that time!","当时那种乌烟瘴气的气氛啊！"
"I perceive that I was an evil-tempered, ill-disposed youth with a great capacity for hatred, BUT—","我觉得我是一个脾气暴躁、不好相处、心中充满仇恨的年轻人，但是——"
"There was an excuse for hate.","这一切都是有原因的。"
"It was wrong of me to hate individuals, to be rude, harsh, and vindictive to this person or that, but indeed it would have been equally wrong to have taken the manifest offer life made me, without resentment.","心怀仇恨、蛮横无理、严厉苛刻、一心想报复别人，这确实是我的不对。但毫无怨恨地宣称生活造就了我，也肯定是不对的。"
"I see now clearly and calmly, what I then felt obscurely and with an unbalanced intensity, that my conditions were intolerable.","而今，我能清楚而冷静地看明白那些当时我怎么都想不通的事情、那些让我心里极度不平衡的遭遇和当时自认为无法忍受的处境。"
"My work was tedious and laborious and it took up an unreasonable proportion of my time, I was ill clothed, ill fed, ill housed, ill educated and ill trained, my will was suppressed and cramped to the pitch of torture, I had no reasonable pride in myself and no reasonable chance of putting anything right.","我的工作乏味而繁重，不合理地占据了我大量的时间，让我吃不饱穿不暖，居无定所，无暇接受良好的教育。我的愿望总是被压抑、被束缚到令人痛苦的程度，我没有理由自豪，也没什么合适的机会去做点正经事儿。"
"It was a life hardly worth living.","活着真没什么乐趣。"
"That a large proportion of the people about me had no better a lot, that many had a worse, does not affect these facts.","而大多数人过得并不比我好，很多人的生活状况比我还要糟糕，但这些都改变不了什么。"
"It was a life in which contentment would have been disgraceful.","满足被看成是一种耻辱，这就是我们的生活。"
"If some of them were contented or resigned, so much the worse for every one.","如果有些人甘愿如此，习惯逆来顺受，那情况就更糟糕了。"
"No doubt it was hasty and foolish of me to throw up my situation, but everything was so obviously aimless and foolish in our social organization that I do not feel disposed to blame myself even for that, except in so far as it pained my mother and caused her anxiety.","对我来说，我的辞职无疑有些草率，可在我们那时的社会体制下，显然一切都是漫无目的、荒谬可笑的，因此我也并不觉得丢了工作有什么可自责的，唯一有些愧疚的是这在一定程度上伤害了我的母亲，让她为我担心了。"
"Think of the one comprehensive fact of the lock-out!","全面地想想封厂这件事儿吧！"
"That year was a bad year, a year of world-wide economic disorganization.","那年的经济不景气，全球都处于经济崩溃的边缘状态。"
"Through their want of intelligent direction the great “Trust” of American ironmasters, a gang of energetic, narrow-minded furnace owners, had smelted far more iron than the whole world had any demand for.","通过他从美国钢铁商获取的一些消息，那是一群精力旺盛却又目光短浅的炼炉主，他们错误地高估了铁的全球需求量。"
"(In those days there existed no means of estimating any need of that sort beforehand.) They had done this without even consulting the ironmasters of any other country.","（那时他们也没有办法提前对此作出预算。）他们在生产前甚至没有咨询过任何其他国家的铁器制造商。"
"During their period of activity they had drawn into their employment a great number of workers, and had erected a huge productive plant.","他们在过量生产铁制品的同时，雇佣了大量的劳力，建造了庞大的生产车间。"
"It is manifestly just that people who do headlong stupid things of this sort should suffer, but in the old days it was quite possible, it was customary for the real blunderers in such disasters, to shift nearly all the consequences of their incapacity.","那些人做了这样轻率、愚蠢的事情，应当受到惩罚，这是理所当然的。但是在过去那个时代，这类灾难的真正肇事者往往会推卸责任，不承认这一切都是由于他们的无能而造成的。"
"No one thought it wrong for a light-witted “captain of industry” who had led his workpeople into overproduction, into the disproportionate manufacture, that is to say, of some particular article, to abandon and dismiss them, nor was there anything to prevent the sudden frantic underselling of some trade rival in order to surprise and destroy his trade, secure his customers for one’s own destined needs, and shift a portion of one’s punishment upon him.","对于一名智商不高的“工业巨头”来说，指挥工人过度生产、不合比例地粗制滥造，比如生产某种特殊产品，而后把它扔掉，是没有什么错的，也没有什么方法可以防止竞争对手突然疯狂大甩卖以打败对方，从而保证自己的客户订单需要，并把自己所受的惩罚转嫁一部分给对方。"
"This operation of spasmodic underselling was known as “dumping.”","这种间歇性的大甩卖行为就是我们知道的“倾销”。"
"The American ironmasters were now dumping on the British market.","美国的铁器制造商那时就在英国市场上进行着倾销行为。"
"The British employers were, of course, taking their loss out of their workpeople as much as possible, but in addition they were agitating for some legislation that would prevent—not stupid relative excess in production, but “dumping”—not the disease, but the consequences of the disease.","英国的雇主们当然就要把他们的损失尽可能多的转移到员工身上。此外他们还推动立法，由此立法可以防止反倾销，而非防止盲目扩大生产——也就是说，可预防疾病可能留下的后遗症，而非疾病本身。"
"The necessary knowledge to prevent either dumping or its causes, the uncorrelated production of commodities, did not exist, but this hardly weighed with them at all, and in answer to their demands there had arisen a curious party of retaliatory-protectionists who combined vague proposals for spasmodic responses to these convulsive attacks from foreign manufacturers, with the very evident intention of achieving financial adventures.","当时还没有必要的知识能够做到防止倾销或者从源头以及商品的非相关生产上打击倾销，但这种知识在当时又是极为重要的。因此，一种新型的报复性保护主义应运而生，保护主义者将国内间歇性应对国外制造商间歇倾销的微弱呼声和达到财政目标这一明显动机结合在了一起。"
"The dishonest and reckless elements were indeed so evident in this movement as to add very greatly to the general atmosphere of distrust and insecurity, and in the recoil from the prospect of fiscal power in the hands of the class of men known as the “New Financiers,” one heard frightened old-fashioned statesmen asserting with passion that “dumping” didn’t occur, or that it was a very charming sort of thing to happen.","在倾销行为中，不正当的、不计后果的因素随处可见，这就在很大程度上增加了公众的不信任感和不安全感，在掌握在所谓“新金融家”手中的财政力量预期的反作用下，骇人听闻的旧式的发言人宣称倾销从未发生过，或者说即将发生的将是一件极具魅力的事情。"
"Nobody would face and handle the rather intricate truth of the business.","没有人能够面对商场上这一复杂局面并且还能应对自如。"
"The whole effect upon the mind of a cool observer was of a covey of unsubstantial jabbering minds drifting over a series of irrational economic cataclysms, prices and employment tumbled about like towers in an earthquake, and amidst the shifting masses were the common work-people going on with their lives as well as they could, suffering, perplexed, unorganized, and for anything but violent, fruitless protests, impotent.","这些东西对于一位冷静观察者产生的影响就是一套不切实际的莫名其妙的见解，它们引发一系列非理性的经济动荡。价格和就业就像是地震中的塔楼，摇摇晃晃，在其中跟着摇晃的人民都是普通劳动者。他们费尽心力只为了生存，他们受苦受难、不解时事、也没有什么组织，除了徒劳的暴力反抗和软弱地接受现状之外，别无他法。"
"You cannot hope now to understand the infinite want of adjustment in the old order of things.","现在你可能无法理解在旧体制下的作出无数次调整的需要。"
"At one time there were people dying of actual starvation in India, while men were burning unsalable wheat in America.","印度曾一度闹饥荒，而那时美国商人却把卖不出去的小麦烧掉。"
"It sounds like the account of a particularly mad dream, does it not?","这听起来就像是个疯狂的梦，不是吗？"
"It was a dream, a dream from which no one on earth expected an awakening.","它是一个梦，一个世上的人们都不敢期待还能从中醒来的噩梦。"
"To us youngsters with the positiveness, the rationalism of youth, it seemed that the strikes and lockouts, the overproduction and misery could not possibly result simply from ignorance and want of thought and feeling.","对我们这些有着进取心和理性的年轻一代来说，似乎罢工、封厂、过量生产、苦难之类的事情不可能仅仅源自于愚昧、思想浅薄或是感情匮乏。"
"We needed more dramatic factors than these mental fogs, these mere atmospheric devils.","我们需要更多戏剧性的因素，而不仅仅是这些思想上的迷茫和邪恶的气氛。"
"We fled therefore to that common refuge of the unhappy ignorant, a belief in callous insensate plots—we called them “plots”—against the poor.","因此我们必须逃离不幸的无知者的共同庇护所，摒弃无情的、压迫贫苦人民的那套信仰，我们将其称之为“阴谋”。"
"You can still see how we figured it in any museum by looking up the caricatures of capital and labor that adorned the German and American socialistic papers of the old time.","现在，在任何一所博物馆里你依然可以看出我们当时是如何描述它的，抬头看看那些反映劳资双方的漫画，这些漫画可以说是旧时代德国和美国社会主义报纸上随处可见的装饰。"
"Section 2","第二节"
"I had cast Nettie off in an eloquent epistle, had really imagined the affair was over forever—“I’ve done with women,” I said to Parload—and then there was silence for more than a week.","我已用一封措辞华丽的信抛弃了妮蒂，并且真的认为我们的这段恋情就会随着那封信而永远结束了。我对帕罗德说：“我跟女人绝缘了。”自那之后的一个多星期，我和妮蒂之间都没有任何书信来往。"
"Before that week was over I was wondering with a growing emotion what next would happen between us.","而那个星期还没结束，我的心里就泛起了涟漪，越来越想知道我们之间的下一步会是什么样子。"
"I found myself thinking constantly of Nettie, picturing her—sometimes with stern satisfaction, sometimes with sympathetic remorse—mourning, regretting, realizing the absolute end that had come between us.","我发觉我自己常常想起妮蒂，脑中不断浮现她的样子——时而无可动摇、心满意足，时而充满同情和后悔——而一想起我们之间已经彻底结束了，我又会感到无限的懊恼和悲伤。"
"At the bottom of my heart I no more believed that there was an end between us, than that an end would come to the world.","在我的内心深处，我觉得我和妮蒂之间是不会分手的，就好像世界末日不会到来一样。"
"Had we not kissed one another, had we not achieved an atmosphere of whispering nearness, breached our virgin shyness with one another?","若是我们从未亲吻过、卿卿我我过、亲密无间过，也从未跨过彼此那道原始的羞涩，那我们的感情又会怎样呢？"
"Of course she was mine, of course I was hers, and separations and final quarrels and harshness and distance were no more than flourishes upon that eternal fact.","我相信她是属于我的，我也是属于她的。我们的断交、最后的争吵和彼此分离，不过都是最后那个完美结局到来前的乐章。"
"So at least I felt the thing, however I shaped my thoughts.","至少我是感受到了这一点的，不管怎么说，我就这样渐渐形成了这样的思想。"
"Whenever my imagination got to work as that week drew to its close, she came in as a matter of course, I thought of her recurrently all day and dreamt of her at night.","随着那个星期一天天过去，每当我展开想象，她就自然而然地出在我的想象空间里。我的脑海中，昼夜都是她的影子。"
"On Saturday night I dreamt of her very vividly.","星期天的晚上，我梦见了她，那个梦是如此的逼真。"
"Her face was flushed and wet with tears, her hair a little disordered, and when I spoke to her she turned away.","她脸泛潮红，哭得梨花带雨，头发有些凌乱地披着，可我刚想跟她说话，她就转过身去了。"
"In some manner this dream left in my mind a feeling of distress and anxiety.","从一定程度上说，这个梦在我脑中留下了苦恼和焦虑的感觉。"
"In the morning I had a raging thirst to see her.","清晨起床，我突然很热切地想要见到她。"
"That Sunday my mother wanted me to go to church very particularly.","那个星期天，母亲很想带我去教堂。"
"She had a double reason for that; she thought that it would certainly exercise a favorable influence upon my search for a situation throughout the next week, and in addition Mr. Gabbitas, with a certain mystery behind his glasses, had promised to see what he could do for me, and she wanted to keep him up to that promise.","主要因为两个原因，一方面她觉得去教堂一定会对我下周找工作有好处。另外，加比塔斯先生的眼镜后透出一丝神秘，他已经答应，看看他是否能帮到我，母亲希望他可以恪守承诺。"
"I half consented, and then my desire for Nettie took hold of me.","我半推半就地答应了，而那时，想见妮蒂的渴望再一次涌上我的心头。"
"I told my mother I wasn’t going to church, and set off about eleven to walk the seventeen miles to Checkshill.","我告诉母亲，我不去教堂了，我要步行十七英里去切克希利，大约十一点钟动身。"
"It greatly intensified the fatigue of that long tramp that the sole of my boot presently split at the toe, and after I had cut the flapping portion off, a nail worked through and began to torment me.","我的靴底脚趾处明显已经张开撕裂了，我把搭下来的一块靴底剪掉后，发现有一颗钉子穿透了靴底，折磨着我的脚，这无疑加剧了我长途旅行的疲劳。"
"However, the boot looked all right after that operation and gave no audible hint of my discomfort.","但是，靴子修好后看上去相当完好，根本看不出我忍受了怎样的痛苦。"
"I got some bread and cheese at a little inn on the way, and was in Checkshill park about four.","途中，我在一家小餐馆里吃了点面包和奶酪，差不多四点的时候到了切克希利公园。"
"I did not go by the road past the house and so round to the gardens, but cut over the crest beyond the second keeper’s cottage, along a path Nettie used to call her own.","我没有走那所房子旁边的马路绕道公园，而是从第二个房主的小屋走近路穿过，沿着妮蒂曾说是她自己的小道走过。"
"It was a mere deer track.","这只是一条羊肠小道而已。"
"It led up a miniature valley and through a pretty dell in which we had been accustomed to meet, and so through the hollies and along a narrow path close by the wall of the shrubbery to the gardens.","它通向一条小峡谷，也穿过一个我们常约会的山谷，山谷里风景如画。它穿过冬青丛，沿着灌木墙附近的狭长小径通向公园。"
"In my memory that walk through the park before I came upon Nettie stands out very vividly.","我还清楚地记得我再遇见妮蒂之前走过公园时的情景。"
"The long tramp before it is foreshortened to a mere effect of dusty road and painful boot, but the bracken valley and sudden tumult of doubts and unwonted expectations that came to me, stands out now as something significant, as something unforgettable, something essential to the meaning of all that followed.","之前的长途旅行的留下的记忆就只剩下尘土飞扬的小路和那双折磨我双脚的靴子了。可那满是欧洲蕨的山谷和突然袭来的疑心以及我少有的热切心绪，那一刻却浮上心头，意味深长，让我无法忘怀。这一切都影响着后面发生的事情。"
"Where should I meet her?","我应该在哪里见她？"
"What would she say?","她会说什么？"
"I had asked these questions before and found an answer.","我之前就这样问过自己，也找到了答案。"
"Now they came again with a trail of fresh implications and I had no answer for them at all.","如今这些问题再次闯进我的脑海，又带来了新的提示，而我却无法回答了。"
"As I approached Nettie she ceased to be the mere butt of my egotistical self-projection, the custodian of my sexual pride, and drew together and became over and above this a personality of her own, a personality and a mystery, a sphinx I had evaded only to meet again.","我一步一步向妮蒂靠近，她不再是我自大的自我投射的笑柄，不再是我大男子主义的监护者，不再跟我站在统一战线，而是超越了她自己的个性，那个神秘事物，我唯一避免再次遇见的斯芬克斯之谜。"
"I find a little difficulty in describing the quality of the old-world love-making so that it may be understandable now.","我觉得要描述旧时代的爱恋本质，以让其在现如今变得可以理解，是一件有点儿困难的事。"
"We young people had practically no preparation at all for the stir and emotions of adolescence.","我们这一代的年轻人对青春期的骚动和激动其实是根本没有准备的。"
"Towards the young the world maintained a conspiracy of stimulating silences.","对年轻人来说，世界对于激发沉默一直保守着秘密。"
"There came no initiation.","没有人可以指点什么。"
"There were books, stories of a curiously conventional kind that insisted on certain qualities in every love affair and greatly intensified one’s natural desire for them, perfect trust, perfect loyalty, lifelong devotion.","有一些书讲述那些稀奇古怪的、传统的故事，里面的爱情总会遵循一定的俗套，这又加强了人们对信赖、忠诚和一生热爱的本能的渴望。"
"Much of the complex essentials of love were altogether hidden.","大多数爱情的复杂本质都被彻底掩盖起来了。"
"One read these things, got accidental glimpses of this and that, wondered and forgot, and so one grew.","人们在阅读这些爱情故事时，总能获得这样那样的意外感受，又历经困惑和遗忘，而后渐渐成熟。"
"Then strange emotions, novel alarming desires, dreams strangely charged with feeling; an inexplicable impulse of self-abandonment began to tickle queerly amongst the familiar purely egotistical and materialistic things of boyhood and girlhood.","而陌生的情感、新奇而可怕的欲望和梦想都能引起强烈的感情。一种无法解释的自我抛弃的冲动在熟悉的少男少女纯粹自私和单纯实利主义的心中莫名其妙地涌动。"
"We were like misguided travelers who had camped in the dry bed of a tropical river.","我们就像是误入歧途的旅客，露宿在一条热带河流干涸的河床里。"
"Presently we were knee deep and neck deep in the flood.","过不了多长时间就会被洪水淹没。"
"Our beings were suddenly going out from ourselves seeking other beings—we knew not why.","我们灵魂突然离开我们的肉体，去追寻其他灵魂的存在，就连我们自己也不知道这是为什么。"
"This novel craving for abandonment to some one of the other sex, bore us away.","这些故事渴望放纵某些异性，让我们觉得厌恶。"
"We were ashamed and full of desire.","我们内心羞愧，而又被欲望填充。"
"We kept the thing a guilty secret, and were resolved to satisfy it against all the world.","我们将此作为罪恶的秘密，却又决定背弃一切而义无反顾地去满足罪恶。"
"In this state it was we drifted in the most accidental way against some other blindly seeking creature, and linked like nascent atoms.","在这个国家里，只有我们以最偶然的方式放任自流，与其他一些盲目的探索者们形成了对比，我们之间像刚刚形成的原子一样相互联系着。"
"We were obsessed by the books we read, by all the talk about us that once we had linked ourselves we were linked for life.","我们被我们读到的那些书吸引，被我们之间的话题困扰，话题一旦联系到我们自己，就会和生命联系起来。"
"Then afterwards we discovered that other was also an egotism, a thing of ideas and impulses, that failed to correspond with ours.","后来我们又发觉，其他生物也是自私自利的，也是有着不同主意和冲动的，和我们根本合不来。"
"So it was, I say, with the young of my class and most of the young people in our world.","我认为，这对我这个阶层的年轻人和我们这个世界的大多数年轻人来说，都是一样的。"
"So it came about that I sought Nettie on the Sunday afternoon and suddenly came upon her, light bodied, slenderly feminine, hazel eyed, with her soft sweet young face under the shady brim of her hat of straw, the pretty Venus I had resolved should be wholly and exclusively mine.","于是，我星期天下午去找妮蒂，竟然正巧就跟她相遇了。她身轻如燕、纤细柔美，淡褐色的眼睛，宽沿的草帽下的面孔线条柔和、亲切可爱、焕发着无限的青春。我曾决定要让这位美丽的维纳斯女神完全专属于我。"
"There, all unaware of me still, she stood, my essential feminine, the embodiment of the inner thing in life for me—and moreover an unknown other, a person like myself.","她就站在那里，完全没有意识到我就在她身边。她洋溢着女性内在的温柔，在我面前展现出内心深处的一面——那和我一样不为人知的一面。"
"She held a little book in her hand, open as if she were walking along and reading it.","她手捧一本翻开的小书，仿佛是在边走边看。"
"That chanced to be her pose, but indeed she was standing quite still, looking away towards the gray and lichenous shrubbery wall and, as I think now, listening.","其实看书不过是一种伪装，事实上她正静静地站着，目光洒向灰蒙蒙的爬满苔藓的灌木墙。我现在记起来了，她是在聆听着什么。"
"Her lips were a little apart, curved to that faint, sweet shadow of a smile.","她的嘴唇微微张开，露出隐约的、甜蜜的微笑。"
"Section 3","第三节"
"I recall with a vivid precision her queer start when she heard the rustle of my approaching feet, her surprise, her eyes almost of dismay for me.","我清楚地记得，当她听见我沙沙的脚步声慢慢靠近时表现出的惊讶，她诧异的眼神几乎让我沮丧。"
"I could recollect, I believe, every significant word she spoke during our meeting, and most of what I said to her.","我相信我能想起我们相见时，她对我说的每一个重要的字，和我对她说的大部分的话语。"
"At least, it seems I could, though indeed I may deceive myself.","至少感觉上我是能回想起来的，尽管事实上我也可能是在自欺欺人。"
"But I will not make the attempt.","但我不会去尝试回想。"
"We were both too ill-educated to speak our full meanings, we stamped out our feelings with clumsy stereotyped phrases; you who are better taught would fail to catch our intention.","我们都没有接受过良好的教育，因此无法清楚完整地说出我们的想法，只能用那些笨拙的、俗不可耐的词表露我们的感情，稍有教养的人都无法弄清我们到底想说些什么。"
"The effect would be inanity.","这确实很愚蠢。"
"But our first words I may give you, because though they conveyed nothing to me at the time, afterwards they meant much.","但我可以告诉你们我们所说的第一句话，因为尽管这些话当时对我来说并没有什么意义，但后来再想起来时，总觉得意味深长。"
"“YOU, Willie!”","“威利，是你！”"
"she said.","她说。"
"“I have come,” I said—forgetting in the instant all the elaborate things I had intended to say.","“我来了，”我说，一时间忘记了之前精心准备的话，"
"“I thought I would surprise you—”","“我以为我会给你一个惊喜——”"
"“Surprise me?”","“惊喜？”"
"“Yes.”","“是啊。”"
"She stared at me for a moment.","她盯着我看了一会儿。"
"I can see her pretty face now as it looked at me—her impenetrable dear face.","在她盯着我看的时候，我能看到她那张可爱的、让人琢磨不透的面庞。"
"She laughed a queer little laugh and her color went for a moment, and then so soon as she had spoken, came back again.","她露出一个奇怪的笑容，脸色有些不对，而一当她开口说话时，神情又恢复了正常。"
"“Surprise me at what?”","“给我什么惊喜？”"
"she said with a rising note.","她提了语调问。"
"I was too intent to explain myself to think of what might lie in that.","我太想解释清楚，也没顾得上我后面说的话可能造成什么误解。"
"“I wanted to tell you,” I said, “that I didn’t mean quite... the things I put in my letter.”","“我想告诉你，”我说，“我信中的话……不是那个意思。”"
"Section 4","第四节"
"When I and Nettie had been sixteen we had been just of an age and contemporaries altogether.","我和妮蒂十六岁的时候，我们还属于同一个时代的同龄人。"
"Now we were a year and three-quarters older, and she—her metamorphosis was almost complete, and I was still only at the beginning of a man’s long adolescence.","而一年九个月过去后，她几乎完全变了一个人，而我却刚刚开始经历漫长的青春期。"
"In an instant she grasped the situation.","她立刻控制了局面。"
"The hidden motives of her quick ripened little mind flashed out their intuitive scheme of action.","她早熟的小脑瓜里隐藏的动机本能地闪现出行动的计划。"
"She treated me with that neat perfection of understanding a young woman has for a boy.","她对待我就像一位少妇对待一个男孩子的态度，圆滑而滴水不漏。"
"“But how did you come?”","“但你是怎么来的呢？”"
"she asked.","她问。"
"I told her I had walked.","我告诉她我是步行来的。"
"“Walked!”","“步行！”"
"In an instant she was leading me towards the gardens.","她立刻带我向花园走去。"
"I MUST be tired.","我一定累了。"
"I must come home with her at once and sit down.","我必须马上跟她回家，坐下来歇歇。"
"Indeed it was near tea-time (the Stuarts had tea at the old-fashioned hour of five).","确实已经快到下午茶时间了（斯图尔特家的习惯是五点钟喝下午茶）。"
"Every one would be SO surprised to see me.","见到我大家一定会大吃一惊的。"
"Fancy walking!","他们肯定想不到我是步行来的！"
"Fancy!","想不到！"
"But she supposed a man thought nothing of seventeen miles.","但她却觉得十七英里对一个男人来说不算什么。"
"When COULD I have started!","什么时候能让我也吃惊一下！"
"All the while, keeping me at a distance, without even the touch of her hand.","她始终跟我保持距离，甚至不让我碰她的手。"
"“But, Nettie!","“可是，妮蒂！"
"I came over to talk to you?”","我来这儿是因为有话想跟你说！”"
"“My dear boy!","“我亲爱的男孩！"
"Tea first, if you please!","不介意的话，请先喝茶！"
"And besides—aren’t we talking?”","另外，我们不是一直在说话吗？”"
"The “dear boy” was a new note, that sounded oddly to me.","“亲爱的男孩”是个新称呼，听起来怪怪的。"
"She quickened her pace a little.","她稍微加快了脚步。"
"“I wanted to explain—” I began.","“我想跟你解释——”我开口说。"
"Whatever I wanted to explain I had no chance to do so.","但不管我想解释什么，都没机会。"
"I said a few discrepant things that she answered rather by her intonation than her words.","我说了不少无关正题的话，与其说她是用话语来回答我，还不如说是在用语调来附和我。"
"When we were well past the shrubbery, she slackened a little in her urgency, and so we came along the slope under the beeches to the garden.","我们要走过灌木丛的时候，她稍微放慢了匆匆的脚步，于是我们就肩并肩地走下了通向花园山毛榉树的斜坡。"
"She kept her bright, straightforward-looking girlish eyes on me as we went; it seemed she did so all the time, but now I know, better than I did then, that every now and then she glanced over me and behind me towards the shrubbery.","我们一边走，她一边用明亮坦然的少女般的目光望着我，似乎她一直都是如此。不过现在我明白了，当时的我并不清楚这一点。她时不时地瞥向我这一边，目光穿过我，落在我身后的灌木丛里。"
"And all the while, behind her quick breathless inconsecutive talk she was thinking.","在她气喘吁吁、上气不接下气的谈话背后，她始终都是在思考着的。"
"Her dress marked the end of her transition.","她的穿着表明了她转型期的结束。"
"Can I recall it?","我还能想起那时她的穿着吗？"
"Not, I am afraid, in the terms a woman would use.","用女人们的话来说，恐怕是想不起来了。"
"But her bright brown hair, which had once flowed down her back in a jolly pig-tail tied with a bit of scarlet ribbon, was now caught up into an intricacy of pretty curves above her little ear and cheek, and the soft long lines of her neck; her white dress had descended to her feet; her slender waist, which had once been a mere geographical expression, an imaginary line like the equator, was now a thing of flexible beauty.","但我记得她亮丽的褐色头发曾垂在背后，用一根深红色的绸带扎成一束活泼的马尾。而现在她却烫了漂亮的大波浪，搭在小巧的耳朵和脸蛋上。还有她的修长的脖颈，长及脚跟的白色长裙，她纤细的腰身过去不过是为了展现身段，就像赤道一样是一条想象中的地理分界线，而现在却变得柔弱灵活，妩媚动人。"
"A year ago she had been a pretty girl’s face sticking out from a little unimportant frock that was carried upon an extremely active and efficient pair of brown-stockinged legs.","一年前，她拥有的还只是一张清纯少女的面庞，穿着普普通通的上衣，腿上套着棕色的长袜，充满朝气。"
"Now there was coming a strange new body that flowed beneath her clothes with a sinuous insistence.","而现在在我面前的是一副完全陌生的、崭新的样子，优雅穿着下面曲线毕露。"
"Every movement, and particularly the novel droop of her hand and arm to the unaccustomed skirts she gathered about her, and a graceful forward inclination that had come to her, called softly to my eyes.","举手投足间，特别是她用双臂拢住新颖别致的裙裾时的样子，是那么的优雅大方，让我目不转睛。"
"A very fine scarf—I suppose you would call it a scarf—of green gossamer, that some new wakened instinct had told her to fling about her shoulders, clung now closely to the young undulations of her body, and now streamed fluttering out for a moment in a breath of wind, and like some shy independent tentacle with a secret to impart, came into momentary contact with my arm.","也许是出于某种刚刚苏醒的本能，她低头看了看自己的双肩，一条精致的绿披肩（我想你应该叫它披肩）紧紧地裹着她线条优美、充满青春的身躯，现正随微风飘动，像是一些羞涩而无束的触须想要透露什么秘密似的，时不时地碰着我的胳膊。"
"She caught it back and reproved it.","她收回披肩，嘴里说了些什么。"
"We went through the green gate in the high garden wall.","我们走过花园高墙的绿色大门。"
"I held it open for her to pass through, for this was one of my restricted stock of stiff politenesses, and then for a second she was near touching me.","我打开门让她先进去，我本来就没多少这种拘谨的礼数，这就是为数不多的一次，有一刻她几乎是擦着我过去的。"
"So we came to the trim array of flower-beds near the head gardener’s cottage and the vistas of “glass” on our left.","我们一起走进园丁领班住所附近的花圃，那花圃收拾得整洁亮丽，从左边看过去，是一长排暖房。"
"We walked between the box edgings and beds of begonias and into the shadow of a yew hedge within twenty yards of that very pond with the gold-fish, at whose brim we had plighted our vows, and so we came to the wistaria-smothered porch.","我们在黄杨木和秋海棠之间走着，走进浆果紫杉树篱的树阴里，这里距我们曾海誓山盟的金鱼池不到二十码。随后，我们便走进了缠满紫藤的门廊。"
"The door was wide open, and she walked in before me.","门是打开着的，她先我一步走了进去。"
"“Guess who has come to see us!”","“猜猜谁来看我们了！”"
"she cried.","她喊着说。"
"Her father answered indistinctly from the parlor, and a chair creaked.","她的父亲的回应声从起居室里隐约传来，而后是椅子吱吱嘎嘎的响声。"
"I judged he was disturbed in his nap.","我想我们吵到他午休了。"
"“Mother!”","“妈妈！”"
"she called in her clear young voice.","她用清亮年轻的声音叫着，"
"“Puss!”","“普斯！”"
"Puss was her sister.","普斯是她的妹妹。"
"She told them in a marveling key that I had walked all the way from Clayton, and they gathered about me and echoed her notes of surprise.","她用惊讶的语气告诉他们，我是从克莱顿一路步行过来的，而后他们都围在我身边，也跟着她发出惊讶的声音。"
"“You’d better sit down, Willie,” said her father; “now you hae got here.","“威利，赶快坐下，”她父亲说，“你都到这里了。"
"How’s your mother?”","你母亲身体怎么样？”"
"He looked at me curiously as he spoke.","他边说边好奇地打量着我。"
"He was dressed in his Sunday clothes, a sort of brownish tweeds, but the waistcoat was unbuttoned for greater comfort in his slumbers.","他穿着礼拜天的服装，那是一套棕色的粗花呢衣服，马甲敞着，这样是为了睡觉更舒适一些。"
"He was a brown-eyed ruddy man, and I still have now in my mind the bright effect of the red-golden hairs that started out from his cheek to flow down into his beard.","他有着一双棕色的眼睛，面色红润，他面颊边上金红色的头发和络腮胡子混在一起。这个形象在我脑中至今都留有鲜明的印象。"
"He was short but strongly built, and his beard and mustache were the biggest things about him.","他个子不高却很结实，最突出的部分则是他满面的胡须。"
"She had taken all the possibility of beauty he possessed, his clear skin, his bright hazel-brown eyes, and wedded them to a certain quickness she got from her mother.","她继承了父亲的所有优点，如白皙的皮肤，淡褐色的明亮眼睛，并且遗传了母亲的动作麻利。"
"Her mother I remember as a sharp-eyed woman of great activity; she seems to me now to have been perpetually bringing in or taking out meals or doing some such service, and to me—for my mother’s sake and my own—she was always welcoming and kind.","在我的印象中，她母亲目光犀利、充满活力。她似乎一直都在不停地进进出出，忙着做饭端饭，或者做一些其他的家务。在我看来，也许是因为我的母亲或是我的缘故，她总是那么热情好客、和蔼可亲。"
"Puss was a youngster of fourteen perhaps, of whom a hard bright stare, and a pale skin like her mother’s, are the chief traces on my memory.","普斯大概十四岁左右，我对她的印象就仅剩下她漠然的目光和像她母亲一样苍白的面色。"
"All these people were very kind to me, and among them there was a common recognition, sometimes very agreeably finding expression, that I was—“clever.”","他们全家人对我都很好，他们有个共识，有时完全溢于言表，那就是他们都觉得我——“聪明”。"
"They all stood about me as if they were a little at a loss.","他们都围着我站着，有点儿不知所措的样子。"
"“Sit down!”","“坐吧！”"
"said her father.","他父亲说，"
"“Give him a chair, Puss.”","“普斯，给他搬把椅子。”"
"We talked a little stiffly—they were evidently surprised by my sudden apparition, dusty, fatigued, and white faced; but Nettie did not remain to keep the conversation going.","我们之间的谈话有点儿不太自然，很明显他们被我的突然造访以及蓬头垢面、疲惫不堪、面色苍白的样子吓到了。但是妮蒂没有留下来继续和我聊天。"
"“There!”","“不好了！”"
"she cried suddenly, as if she were vexed.","她突然烦躁地叫了起来，"
"“I declare!”","“我肯定！”"
"and she darted out of the room.","说着她就冲出了房间。"
"“Lord!","“天呢！"
"what a girl it is!”","这孩子怎么了！”"
"said Mrs. Stuart.","斯图尔特夫人说，"
"“I don’t know what’s come to her.”","“我不知道她怎么了。”"
"It was half an hour before Nettie came back.","妮蒂半小时后才回来。"
"It seemed a long time to me, and yet she had been running, for when she came in again she was out of breath.","这半小时对我来说似乎太漫长了，而她显然一直在跑，因为她回来的时候已经是上气不接下气了。"
"In the meantime, I had thrown out casually that I had given up my place at Rawdon’s.","她进来的时候，我漫不经心地告诉他们我已经跟罗顿辞职了。"
"“I can do better than that,” I said.","“我会干得更好的。”我说。"
"“I left my book in the dell,” she said, panting.","“我把书落在小山谷里了，”她喘着粗气说，"
"“Is tea ready?”","“茶好了没有？”"
"and that was her apology...","这就算是她的道歉了……"
"We didn’t shake down into comfort even with the coming of the tea-things.","即使在喝下午茶的时候，我们也没有感到轻松。"
"Tea at the gardener’s cottage was a serious meal, with a big cake and little cakes, and preserves and fruit, a fine spread upon a table.","园丁住所的下午茶算得上一顿正餐。有一张大饼和一些小蛋糕，桌上精心地摆着果酱和水果。"
"You must imagine me, sullen, awkward, and preoccupied, perplexed by the something that was inexplicably unexpected in Nettie, saying little, and glowering across the cake at her, and all the eloquence I had been concentrating for the previous twenty-four hours, miserably lost somewhere in the back of my mind.","你一定可以想象到，那时的我面色阴郁、表情尴尬、心事重重，被妮蒂莫名其妙的行为弄得不知所措，不知道应该说些什么，只能将目光穿过蛋糕落在她的身上。过去24小时里的能言善辩完全被我抛到脑后了。"
"Nettie’s father tried to set me talking; he had a liking for my gift of ready speech, for his own ideas came with difficulty, and it pleased and astonished him to hear me pouring out my views.","妮蒂的父亲尝试让我能说些什么，他很欣赏我的口才，因为他自己不善言辞，所以听我滔滔不绝地讲述我的观点会使他又惊又喜。"
"Indeed, over there I was, I think, even more talkative than with Parload, though to the world at large I was a shy young lout.","确实，我自己也觉得那时的我甚至要比跟帕罗德一起时还要健谈，尽管对世界上大多数人来说，我不过是个羞涩的傻小子。"
"“You ought to write it out for the newspapers,” he used to say.","“你真应该写出来为报纸撰稿。”他常这么说，"
"“That’s what you ought to do.","“你真应该这么做。"
"I never heard such nonsense.”","我从未听过这样的事情。”"
"Or, “You’ve got the gift of the gab, young man.","或者是，“小伙子，你口才太好了。"
"We ought to ha’ made a lawyer of you.”","我们应该让你去当律师。”"
"But that afternoon, even in his eyes, I didn’t shine.","可是那天下午，就算在他眼里，我都已经黯然失色了。"
"Failing any other stimulus, he reverted to my search for a situation, but even that did not engage me.","他用了很多种方法来激发我都没管用，后来又问我找工作的事情，可那也没能让我提起兴趣。"
"Section 5","第五节"
"For a long time I feared I should have to go back to Clayton without another word to Nettie, she seemed insensible to the need I felt for a talk with her, and I was thinking even of a sudden demand for that before them all.","很长时间以来，我都担心自己恐怕还没跟妮蒂多说一句话就得返回克莱顿，她似乎完全不知道我想跟她谈心的渴望，而我却一直惦念这件事儿，这可不是什么心血来潮。"
"It was a transparent manoeuver of her mother’s who had been watching my face, that sent us out at last together to do something—I forget now what—in one of the greenhouses.","她的母亲一直盯着我看，意图很明显，就是想让我们一起去暖房里干点儿事情——我现在已经忘了当时要做什么了。"
"Whatever that little mission may have been it was the merest, most barefaced excuse, a door to shut, or a window to close, and I don’t think it got done.","而不管那是什么微不足道的事情，是关门还是关窗，都是最为露骨的借口，但我觉得那都起不了什么作用。"
"Nettie hesitated and obeyed.","妮蒂犹豫了一下，还是同意了。"
"She led the way through one of the hot-houses.","她带我穿过一间暖房。"
"It was a low, steamy, brick-floored alley between staging that bore a close crowd of pots and ferns, and behind big branching plants that were spread and nailed overhead so as to make an impervious cover of leaves, and in that close green privacy she stopped and turned on me suddenly like a creature at bay.","那条砖砌的小巷低矮而潮湿，到处都是水汽蒙蒙的。我们从满是大麻叶和蕨类植物的架子中间穿过，架子后面的植物长得郁郁葱葱，四处蔓延，穿越头顶，树叶厚厚地遮了一层，就在这狭窄的绿色隐蔽的地方，她停下了脚步，像无路可走的动物一样突然转身面向我。"
"“Isn’t the maidenhair fern lovely?”","“银杏蕨太可爱了，不是吗？”"
"she said, and looked at me with eyes that said, “NOW.”","她望着我说，眼睛示意着“现在”。"
"“Nettie,” I began, “I was a fool to write to you as I did.”","“妮蒂，”我说，“我太傻了，竟然给你写那样的信。”"
"She startled me by the assent that flashed out upon her face.","她脸上表现出同意的表情，这让我颇为惊讶。"
"But she said nothing, and stood waiting.","而她却什么也没说，只是站在那里等着。"
"“Nettie,” I plunged, “I can’t do without you.","“妮蒂，”我进一步说，“我不能没有你。"
"I—I love you.”","我——我爱你。”"
"“If you loved me,” she said trimly, watching the white fingers she plunged among the green branches of a selaginella, “could you write the things you do to me?”","“如果你曾爱过我，”她打断我，望着自己插在绿色枝叶里白皙的手指说，“你怎么会写那种信给我？”"
"“I don’t mean them,” I said.","“我不是那个意思，”我说，"
"“At least not always.”","“至少不总是那个意思。”"
"I thought really they were very good letters, and that Nettie was stupid to think otherwise, but I was for the moment clearly aware of the impossibility of conveying that to her.","我真的觉得那些信写得太好了，妮蒂那样想实在是太傻了，但我那时清醒地知道，我不能向她那样吐露心声。"
"“You wrote them.”","“可你就是那样写的。”"
"“But then I tramp seventeen miles to say I don’t mean them.”","“但我却走了十七英里来告诉你，我不是那个意思。”"
"“Yes.","“这是不错。"
"But perhaps you do.”","但说不定你就是那个意思。”"
"I think I was at a loss; then I said, not very clearly, “I don’t.”","我觉得我当时完全不知道该怎么做，后来我只能含混地说：“不是。”"
"“You think you—you love me, Willie.","“威利，你以为你——你爱我，"
"But you don’t.”","但你其实并不爱我。”"
"“I do.","“我爱你。"
"Nettie!","妮蒂！"
"You know I do.”","你知道我爱你。”"
"For answer she shook her head.","她摇了摇头，算是对我的回答。"
"I made what I thought was a most heroic plunge.","我做出了当时我自认为最英勇的进攻。"
"“Nettie,” I said, “I’d rather have you than—than my own opinions.”","“妮蒂，”我说，“相比于我的思想，我情愿拥有你。”"
"The selaginella still engaged her.","她的目光依然停留在枝枝叶叶上。"
"“You think so now,” she said.","“你只是现在这么想。”她说。"
"I broke out into protestations.","我开始反驳。"
"“No,” she said shortly.","“不，”她简洁地说，"
"“It’s different now.”","“现在又不一样了。”"
"“But why should two letters make so much difference?”","“但为什么两封信就能造成这么大的区别呢？”"
"I said.","我问。"
"“It isn’t only the letters.","“这不仅是信的问题。"
"But it is different.","但就是不一样了。"
"It’s different for good.”","永远都不一样了。”"
"She halted a little with that sentence, seeking her expression.","说完她顿了一下，似乎在找合适词语来表达。"
"She looked up abruptly into my eyes and moved, indeed slightly, but with the intimation that she thought our talk might end.","她突然抬起头凝望着我的眼睛，有些激动，也有一种暗示，她觉得我们之间的谈话应该结束了。"
"But I did not mean it to end like that.","但我不想就这么结束。"
"“For good?”","“永远？”"
"said I.","我说，"
"“No!..","“不！……"
"Nettie!","妮蒂！"
"Nettie!","妮蒂！"
"You don’t mean that!”","你不是这个意思！”"
"“I do,” she said deliberately, still looking at me, and with all her pose conveying her finality.","“我确实是这个意思。”她依旧望着我，镇定地说，她举手投足间都在告诉我这是她最后的定论。"
"She seemed to brace herself for the outbreak that must follow.","看上去她已经做好了一切准备，随时应对之后将发生的一切。"
"Of course I became wordy.","我当然开始变得唠唠叨叨。"
"But I did not submerge her.","但是我并没有能说服她。"
"She stood entrenched, firing her contradictions like guns into my scattered discursive attack.","她站在那里，对我的零星散乱的进攻一一击破。"
"I remember that our talk took the absurd form of disputing whether I could be in love with her or not.","印象中我们的争论是很可笑的，竟然在我是否爱她这个问题上争论不休。"
"And there was I, present in evidence, in a deepening and widening distress of soul because she could stand there, defensive, brighter and prettier than ever, and in some inexplicable way cut off from me and inaccessible.","现在看来，我当时很明显正越来越深地陷入痛苦中，因为那时的她能以一种自我保护的态度站在那里，比以往任何时候都更加伶牙俐齿、楚楚动人，并可以用难以捉摸的方式拒我以千里之外。"
"You know, we had never been together before without little enterprises of endearment, without a faintly guilty, quite delightful excitement.","你要知道，若是没有表示亲昵的那点儿胆量，没有一丝愧疚感，没有一毫令人兴奋不已的刺激，我们之前是绝不会在一起的。"
"I pleaded, I argued.","我恳求她，并为自己辩解。"
"I tried to show that even my harsh and difficult letters came from my desire to come wholly into contact with her.","我试着向她证明，我写那些苛刻的、让人无法接受的信件，都是因为我想更深入地跟她沟通。"
"I made exaggerated fine statements of the longing I felt for her when I was away, of the shock and misery of finding her estranged and cool.","我夸张地说，我没跟她在一起时，我是多么思念她。看见她跟我疏远、冷淡的态度，我是多么的震惊和痛苦。"
"She looked at me, feeling the emotion of my speech and impervious to its ideas.","她看着我，领会到我话语中强烈的感情，却始终不为之所动。"
"I had no doubt—whatever poverty in my words, coolly written down now—that I was eloquent then.","我毫不怀疑我当时是多么的能言善辩。即使我当时已经理屈词穷，我现在依然能冷静地写下来。"
"I meant most intensely what I said, indeed I was wholly concentrated upon it.","我是认真的，的确不是在开玩笑，我当时精神十分集中。"
"I was set upon conveying to her with absolute sincerity my sense of distance, and the greatness of my desire.","我真心向她吐露心声，告诉她我所感受到的她的疏远和冷淡，以及我是多么希望跟她好好谈谈。"
"I toiled toward her painfully and obstinately through a jungle of words.","我通过语言艰难而顽强地一点点靠近她。"
"Her face changed very slowly—by such imperceptible degrees as when at dawn light comes into a clear sky.","她的脸色慢慢变化着，像是晴空中的阳光一样难以察觉。"
"I could feel that I touched her, that her hardness was in some manner melting, her determination softening toward hesitations.","我能感到我的话触动了她，她冷漠的表情正在一点点缓和，她原本坚定的心开始犹豫。"
"The habit of an old familiarity lurked somewhere within her.","曾经亲昵的习惯在她体内蠢蠢欲动。"
"But she would not let me reach her.","而她依然不允许我靠近她。"
"“No,” she cried abruptly, starting into motion.","“不。”她突然喊了一声，激动起来。"
"She laid a hand on my arm.","她把一只手放在我的胳膊上。"
"A wonderful new friendliness came into her voice.","她的声音中露出一种崭新而奇妙的友谊之情。"
"“It’s impossible, Willie.","“这不可能了，威利。"
"Everything is different now—everything.","现在一切都不一样了——一切。"
"We made a mistake.","我们犯了一个错误。"
"We two young sillies made a mistake and everything is different for ever.","我们两个小傻瓜犯了一个错误，而现在一切都不一样了，永远不一样了。"
"Yes, yes.”","没错，就是这样。”"
"She turned about.","她转过身去。"
"“Nettie!”","“妮蒂！”"
"cried I, and still protesting, pursued her along the narrow alley between the staging toward the hot-house door.","我大声叫着，仍旧反驳着她，一边顺着通向暖房门前架子之间的狭长小径追赶她。"
"I pursued her like an accusation, and she went before me like one who is guilty and ashamed.","她在前面跑，我在后面追，仿佛我就是原告在追羞愧的被告。"
"So I recall it now.","直到现在此情此景仍让我难以忘怀。"
"She would not let me talk to her again.","但她不再给我交谈的机会了。"
"Yet I could see that my talk to her had altogether abolished the clear-cut distance of our meeting in the park.","但我看得出，我的话已经打消了我们在公园里见面时那种明显的冷漠和距离感。"
"Ever and again I found her hazel eyes upon me.","我察觉到她淡褐色的眼睛时不时地望向我这边。"
"They expressed something novel—a surprise, as though she realized an unwonted relationship, and a sympathetic pity.","眼神中她透露出某种新奇的光彩，或者说是一种惊奇的神情，似乎她已经意识到那是一种不同寻常的关系和一种怜悯与同情。"
"And still—something defensive.","不过那仍然带着某种防御性的意味。"
"When we got back to the cottage, I fell talking rather more freely with her father about the nationalization of railways, and my spirits and temper had so far mended at the realization that I could still produce an effect upon Nettie, that I was even playful with Puss.","当我们回去后，我觉得我能相当自由地跟她父亲谈论铁路国有化的事情了。一想到我依然能够对妮蒂产生影响，想到我甚至能跟普斯开玩笑，我的精神和情绪都有了很大的调整。"
"Mrs. Stuart judged from that that things were better with me than they were, and began to beam mightily.","斯图尔特夫人也由此看得出他们跟我的关系已经好转了，脸上露出了笑容。"
"But Nettie remained thoughtful and said very little.","但是妮蒂依然是一副若有所思的样子，很少讲话。"
"She was lost in perplexities I could not fathom, and presently she slipped away from us and went upstairs.","可我不知道她因为什么变得如此茫然，没过多久，她就悄悄上楼了。"
"Section 6","第六节"
"I was, of course, too footsore to walk back to Clayton, but I had a shilling and a penny in my pocket for the train between Checkshill and Two-Mile Stone, and that much of the distance I proposed to do in the train.","我双脚疼痛不已，自然没有办法再走回克莱顿，但我口袋里还有一先令一便士，够我坐切克希利和两里石之间的火车。于是我打算乘火车坐过大半的路程。"
"And when I got ready to go, Nettie amazed me by waking up to the most remarkable solicitude for me.","我正要走时，妮蒂突然对我表露出明显的关心，这让我惊讶不已。"
"I must, she said, go by the road.","她告诉我说，我必须要走公路。"
"It was altogether too dark for the short way to the lodge gates.","因为天已经完全黑了，就连通往大门的那一小段路程都看不清了。"
"I pointed out that it was moonlight.","我跟她说还有月光。"
"“With the comet thrown in,” said old Stuart.","“还有彗星的光芒。”老斯图尔特说。"
"“No,” she insisted, “you MUST go by the road.”","“不，”她坚持说，“你必须走公路。”"
"I still disputed.","我依然坚持。"
"She was standing near me.","她站在我身边。"
"“To please ME,” she urged, in a quick undertone, and with a persuasive look that puzzled me.","“就算为了我。”她小声而快速地说，她劝解的眼神让我不解。"
"Even in the moment I asked myself why should this please her?","即使到现在，我依然还会问自己，走公路怎么会讨好她？"
"I might have agreed had she not followed that up with, “The hollies by the shrubbery are as dark as pitch.","如果她后面不再说什么，也许我就答应了。但她却接着说：“灌木丛旁边的冬青树漆黑一片。"
"And there’s the deer-hounds.”","而且还有猎鹿犬。”"
"“I’m not afraid of the dark,” said I.","“我从不怕黑。”我说，"
"“Nor of the deer-hounds, either.”","“也不怕什么猎鹿犬。”"
"“But those dogs!","“但是那些狗！"
"Supposing one was loose!”","万一有只被放出来了怎么办！”"
"That was a girl’s argument, a girl who still had to understand that fear is an overt argument only for her own sex.","这就是一个女孩子的理由，这个女孩子得知道，胆怯不过是她这个性别才说得出的理由。"
"I thought too of those grisly lank brutes straining at their chains and the chorus they could make of a night when they heard belated footsteps along the edge of the Killing Wood, and the thought banished my wish to please her.","我也想过，这些可怕而精壮的畜生被紧紧拴在铁链上，一到晚上，它们一听见从屠宰林旁传来的匆匆的脚步声就会一起狂吠，这个想法打消了我讨好她的愿望。"
"Like most imaginative natures I was acutely capable of dreads and retreats, and constantly occupied with their suppression and concealment, and to refuse the short cut when it might appear that I did it on account of half a dozen almost certainly chained dogs was impossible.","和想象力丰富的人一样，我胆子特别小，经常退缩，常常忙于压抑并掩盖这些念头，并在可能出现的时候拒绝打断，我不能因为几只几乎可以断定是被紧拴着的狗才这样做。"
"So I set off in spite of her, feeling valiant and glad to be so easily brave, but a little sorry that she should think herself crossed by me.","因此我没有理会她就上路了，我觉得自己相当勇敢，而且喜出望外地发现勇敢是如此简单，但同时也有点儿遗憾，因为她会觉得她被我征服了。"
"A thin cloud veiled the moon, and the way under the beeches was dark and indistinct.","月亮在薄云的笼罩下洒下蒙眬的光，山毛榉下的小路一片漆黑，难以辨认。"
"I was not so preoccupied with my love-affairs as to neglect what I will confess was always my custom at night across that wild and lonely park.","我没有被爱情冲昏头脑，忽略一个该承认的事实，那就是我习惯在晚上穿过了无一人的寂静的公园。"
"I made myself a club by fastening a big flint to one end of my twisted handkerchief and tying the other about my wrist, and with this in my pocket, went on comforted.","我把一大块打火石绑在一张发皱的手帕一端，另一端系在手腕上，当作球棒用，口袋里有了这个，走夜路就放心多了。"
"And it chanced that as I emerged from the hollies by the corner of the shrubbery I was startled to come unexpectedly upon a young man in evening dress smoking a cigar.","碰巧的是我刚从灌木丛角落的冬青丛走出来，就遇见了一个穿着晚礼服、抽着雪茄的年轻人，这不免吓了我一跳。"
"I was walking on turf, so that the sound I made was slight.","那时我正走在草地上，所以脚步很轻。"
"He stood clear in the moonlight, his cigar glowed like a blood-red star, and it did not occur to me at the time that I advanced towards him almost invisibly in an impenetrable shadow.","他站在月色中，清晰可见，雪茄在夜色中闪烁，像一颗血红的星星，当时我并没有预想到我在漆黑中走近他，几乎令人难以发觉。"
"“Hullo,” he cried, with a sort of amiable challenge.","“嘿，”他的口吻里带着一种和气的挑衅，"
"“I’m here first!”","“是我先在这儿的！”"
"I came out into the light.","我走近月色中。"
"“Who cares if you are?”","“那又怎样？”"
"said I.","我说。"
"I had jumped at once to an interpretation of his words.","我立刻反驳了他的话。"
"I knew that there was an intermittent dispute between the House people and the villager public about the use of this track, and it is needless to say where my sympathies fell in that dispute.","我知道，议员贵族和平民百姓在这条小路的使用上陆续发生过争执，我不用多说我在争执中站在哪一边了。"
"“Eh?”","“什么？”"
"he cried in surprise.","他惊叫说。"
"“Thought I would run away, I suppose,” said I, and came close up to him.","“你想我应该会仓皇逃走，是吧。”我边说边向他靠近。"
"All my enormous hatred of his class had flared up at the sight of his costume, at the fancied challenge of his words.","我一看见他这身纨绔子弟的装束和他话语中挑衅的语气，我就抑制不住心中无限的反感。"
"I knew him.","我认识他。"
"He was Edward Verrall, son of the man who owned not only this great estate but more than half of Rawdon’s pot-bank, and who had interests and possessions, collieries and rents, all over the district of the Four Towns.","他名叫爱德华·维罗尔，他父亲不仅拥有这片房产，还有着罗顿瓷器的大半资产，还有整个四镇地区的股权、财产、煤矿和出租的房地产。"
"He was a gallant youngster, people said, and very clever.","人们常说，他是个勇敢的年轻人，而且很聪明。"
"Young as he was there was talk of parliament for him; he had been a great success at the university, and he was being sedulously popularized among us.","尽管他很年轻，但传言说他就要进议会了。他在大学里表现优异，在我们这些人中颇受欢迎。"
"He took with a light confidence, as a matter of course, advantages that I would have faced the rack to get, and I firmly believed myself a better man than he.","他定了定神，而事实上，这倒是有助于我面对极大的痛苦，而且我坚信我自己要比他更优秀。"
"He was, as he stood there, a concentrated figure of all that filled me with bitterness.","他站在那里，简直就像是一个资本家的缩影，让我痛苦。"
"One day he had stopped in a motor outside our house, and I remember the thrill of rage with which I had noted the dutiful admiration in my mother’s eyes as she peered through her blind at him.","我至今还记得有天他把摩托车停在我们家前面，激起了我的怒火。而那时我的母亲眼神中却流露出恭顺和钦佩，如同她应尽的职责一般。她透过百叶窗凝视着他。"
"“That’s young Mr. Verrall,” she said.","“这就是小维罗尔先生，”她说，"
"“They say he’s very clever.”","“大家都夸他很聪明。”"
"“They would,” I answered.","“他们当然会这么说，”我回答说，"
"“Damn them and him!”","“让他们见鬼去吧！”"
"But that is by the way.","但那不过是随便说说而已。"
"He was clearly astonished to find himself face to face with a man.","当他发现他是跟一个男人面对面时，他显然感到很吃惊。"
"His note changed.","他连音调都变了。"
"“Who the devil are YOU?”","“你到底是什么人？”"
"he asked.","他问道。"
"My retort was the cheap expedient of re-echoing, “Who the devil are you?”","我反唇相讥，反问道：“你又到底是什么人？”"
"“WELL,” he said.","“哎哟。”他说。"
"“I’m coming along this path if I like,” I said.","“这路我爱走就走，”我说，"
"“See?","“明白吗？"
"It’s a public path—just as this used to be public land.","这是条公共道路，就像这里曾经是公共用地一样。"
"You’ve stolen the land—you and yours, and now you want to steal the right of way.","你窃取了这块土地——你和你们的同类，现在你还要窃取这条路的使用权。"
"You’ll ask us to get off the face of the earth next.","下一步你就会要我们滚出地球了。"
"I sha’n’t oblige.","我不会任你摆布。"
"See?”","你懂不懂？”"
"I was shorter and I suppose a couple of years younger than he, but I had the improvised club in my pocket gripped ready, and I would have fought with him very cheerfully.","我没有他高，估计要比他小上几岁，但我手里紧紧攥着口袋里临时做成的武器，我非常乐意跟他打一架。"
"But he fell a step backward as I came toward him.","但我一靠近他，他就开始后退。"
"“Socialist, I presume?”","“你是社会主义者，我没猜错吧？”"
"he said, alert and quiet and with the faintest note of badinage.","他带着警惕、从容而略有嘲弄的口吻说。"
"“One of many.”","“其中的一员。”"
"“We’re all socialists nowadays,” he remarked philosophically, “and I haven’t the faintest intention of disputing your right of way.”","“那这么说我们都是社会主义者”，他镇定地说，“我从未想过要剥夺你的道路使用权。”"
"“You’d better not,” I said.","“最好没有。”我说。"
"“No!”","“绝对没有。”"
"“No.”","“没有就好。”"
"He replaced his cigar, and there was a brief pause.","他换了一支雪茄，沉默了片刻"
"“Catching a train?”","“要赶火车吗？”"
"he threw out.","他拾起了话题。"
"It seemed absurd not to answer.","似乎不回应不太礼貌。"
"“Yes,” I said shortly.","“是的。”我简单地答道。"
"He said it was a pleasant evening for a walk.","他说这是个适合散步的晚上。"
"I hovered for a moment and there was my path before me, and he stood aside.","我徘徊了一下，路就在我面前。他往边上站了站。"
"There seemed nothing to do but go on.","看来只有继续赶路了。"
"“Good night,” said he, as that intention took effect.","“晚安。”他说，意图很明显。"
"I growled a surly good-night.","我也大喊了一声晚安。"
"I felt like a bombshell of swearing that must presently burst with some violence as I went on my silent way.","我觉得自己就像是一颗炸弹一般，一边安静地赶路，一边信誓旦旦地要随时迸发出暴力。"
"He had so completely got the best of our encounter.","他已经完全领略到我们之间遭遇战的火药味。"
"Section 7","第七节"
"There comes a memory, an odd intermixture of two entirely divergent things, that stands out with the intensest vividness.","我脑中有一种记忆，那是两件完全不同的事情的混合体，这记忆十分生动有趣。"
"As I went across the last open meadow, following the short cut to Checkshill station, I perceived I had two shadows.","在我穿过最后一片开阔的草甸，沿着小道向切克希利车站方向走去时，我发觉我竟然有两个影子。"
"The thing jumped into my mind and stopped its tumid flow for a moment.","这事儿跳进了我的脑海，一时间平息了我汹涌的思绪。"
"I remember the intelligent detachment of my sudden interest.","我记起我自己的一时兴起是多么的明智。"
"I turned sharply, and stood looking at the moon and the great white comet, that the drift of the clouds had now rather suddenly unveiled.","我猛然转过头，停下脚步，仰望月亮和白色的彗星，漂浮的白云也突然显现出来。"
"The comet was perhaps twenty degrees from the moon.","彗星距月亮大约20度。"
"What a wonderful thing it looked floating there, a greenish-white apparition in the dark blue deeps!","它看上去漂浮不定，如此神奇，就像深蓝色深渊中的绿白色的幽灵！"
"It looked brighter than the moon because it was smaller, but the shadow it cast, though clearer cut, was much fainter than the moon’s shadow... I went on noting these facts, watching my two shadows precede me.","它显得比月亮还要明亮，因为它更小，但它的影子要比月亮淡得多，不过它的边缘很清晰……我继续观察着这些，注视着我身前的两个影子。"
"I am totally unable to account for the sequence of my thoughts on this occasion.","我完全没有办法解释我此刻汹涌的思绪。"
"But suddenly, as if I had come on this new fact round a corner, the comet was out of my mind again, and I was face to face with an absolutely new idea.","但突然间，似乎我曾在一个路口见到过这个新的事实。我的思绪再次从彗星上抽回，而我面对的是一个绝对全新的观点。"
"I wonder sometimes if the two shadows I cast, one with a sort of feminine faintness with regard to the other and not quite so tall, may not have suggested the word or the thought of an assignation to my mind.","我投下的两个影子，一个带有某种女性的柔弱，相比之下另一个也不算高大。我有时会想，这两个影子是否会让人联想到外界强加给我的表达或者思想。"
"All that I have clear is that with the certitude of intuition I knew what it was that had brought the youth in evening dress outside the shrubbery.","但有一点是确定的，那就是凭我的直觉，我知道为什么那个年轻人会穿着晚礼服站在灌木丛旁。"
"Of course!","确定无疑！"
"He had come to meet Nettie!","他是来见妮蒂的！"
"Once the mental process was started it took no time at all.","一旦思维走向正轨，就不会再耗费时间了。"
"The day which had been full of perplexities for me, the mysterious invisible thing that had held Nettie and myself apart, the unaccountable strange something in her manner, was revealed and explained.","那个令我满是困惑的日子，那潜在的令我和妮蒂分手的事情以及她奇怪而难以解释的举止，在那一刻都被揭露出来，我终于明白这一切都是为什么了。"
"I knew now why she had looked guilty at my appearance, what had brought her out that afternoon, why she had hurried me in, the nature of the “book” she had run back to fetch, the reason why she had wanted me to go back by the high-road, and why she had pitied me.","现在我知道为什么我的到来会让她显得内疚，那天下午她为什么会出门，为什么她慌忙让我进屋，而她却回去“取书”，为什么她坚持要我走高速公路，为什么她会同情我。"
"It was all in the instant clear to me.","刹那间，我明白了一切。"
"You must imagine me a black little creature, suddenly stricken still—for a moment standing rigid—and then again suddenly becoming active with an impotent gesture, becoming audible with an inarticulate cry, with two little shadows mocking my dismay, and about this figure you must conceive a great wide space of moonlit grass, rimmed by the looming suggestion of distant trees—trees very low and faint and dim, and over it all the domed serenity of that wonderful luminous night.","你一定会把我想成是一个黑小子，突然平静下来，一瞬间僵住，继而又突然活跃起来，无力地比划着手势，口齿不清地叫喊着，垂头丧气，沮丧不已，两个小影子在一旁嘲笑着我。对于这种形象，想必你一定能想象出月光下开阔的草地，远处的树林隐约勾勒出它的边缘，那些树木低矮、模糊、黯淡，而这一切都被静谧明亮的夜晚而笼罩。"
"For a little while this realization stunned my mind.","一时间这一想法让我不知所措。"
"My thoughts came to a pause, staring at my discovery.","我的思维瞬间停滞在这一发现上。"
"Meanwhile my feet and my previous direction carried me through the warm darkness to Checkshill station with its little lights, to the ticket-office window, and so to the train.","而与此同时，我的双脚和我先前行动的方向又带我穿过温暖的黑暗，在溶溶月光下向切克希利火车站的售票处窗口走去，而后走向火车。"
"I remember myself as it were waking up to the thing—I was alone in one of the dingy “third-class” compartments of that time—and the sudden nearly frantic insurgence of my rage.","在我印象中，当我渐渐清醒过来时，我正一个人坐在一节“三等”车厢里，心中那狂乱的愤怒突然就爆发出来了。"
"I stood up with the cry of an angry animal, and smote my fist with all my strength against the panel of wood before me....","我发出一声困兽般的怒吼，使尽浑身力气，一拳砸在面前的木板上……"
"Curiously enough I have completely forgotten my mood after that for a little while, but I know that later, for a minute perhaps, I hung for a time out of the carriage with the door open, contemplating a leap from the train.","而奇怪的是，没过多长时间我就完全忘掉了我的火气，可我后来明白，差不多一分钟之后，我从开着的车厢门向外探出身去，想着如何能从火车上跳下去。"
"It was to be a dramatic leap, and then I would go storming back to her, denounce her, overwhelm her; and I hung, urging myself to do it.","那将是富有戏剧性的一跳，之后我会突然闪回她身边，谴责她，征服她。我就那样探着身子，催促自己那样做。"
"I don’t remember how it was I decided not to do this, at last, but in the end I didn’t.","我已经忘记我是怎么决定还是不要这样的，总之我最后还是没有那么做。"
"When the train stopped at the next station I had given up all thoughts of going back.","当火车在下一站停下时，我已经完全放弃了回去找她的想法。"
"I was sitting in the corner of the carriage with my bruised and wounded hand pressed under my arm, and still insensible to its pain, trying to think out clearly a scheme of action—action that should express the monstrous indignation that possessed me.","我坐在车厢的角落里，淤青受伤的手压在胳膊下面，却感觉不到疼，企图想出一套清晰的行动方案来，这个行动要能表达支配我的仇恨。"

"The Revolver","左轮手枪"
"Section 1","第一节"
"“THAT comet is going to hit the earth!”","“那颗彗星就要撞地球了！”"
"So said one of the two men who got into the train and settled down.","两个男人上了火车坐下来，其中一个这样说道。"
"“Ah!”","“啊！”"
"said the other man.","另一个吃惊地说。"
"“They do say that it is made of gas, that comet.","“他们确实说那彗星是由气体组成的。"
"We sha’n’t blow up, shall us?”...","我们应该不会爆炸，是吧？”……"
"What did it matter to me?","这跟我有什么关系？"
"I was thinking of revenge—revenge against the primary conditions of my being.","我正在想着我应该怎样报复，怎样报复我生活最初状况。"
"I was thinking of Nettie and her lover.","我正在想妮蒂和她的恋人。"
"I was firmly resolved he should not have her—though I had to kill them both to prevent it.","我暗下决心，绝不能让他拥有她，就算我不得不把他们都杀了我也要阻止他们在一起。"
"I did not care what else might happen, if only that end was ensured.","我不在乎别的，只要能保证结局顺利实现就行。"
"All my thwarted passions had turned to rage.","我所有的挫败感都转化成了愤怒。"
"I would have accepted eternal torment that night without a second thought, to be certain of revenge.","要不是下定决心一定要报复，在那晚我可能就接受了永远的痛苦。"
"A hundred possibilities of action, a hundred stormy situations, a whirl of violent schemes, chased one another through my shamed, exasperated mind.","我恼羞成怒，无数种可能采取的行动、可能产生的暴力冲突以及一系列的暴力方案像走马灯似的在我脑中一个接一个地闪现。"
"The sole prospect I could endure was of some gigantic, inexorably cruel vindication of my humiliated self.","我唯一能承受的未来就是猛烈、无情、残酷地报复那个使我蒙羞的人。"
"And Nettie?","但妮蒂呢？"
"I loved Nettie still, but now with the intensest jealousy, with the keen, unmeasuring hatred of wounded pride, and baffled, passionate desire.","我依然爱着妮蒂，而如今这份爱却掺杂了浓烈的嫉妒和因伤了自尊心而产生的强烈而无法言说的仇恨以及因受挫而产生的强烈的报复欲望。"
"Section 2","第二节"
"As I came down the hill from Clayton Crest—for my shilling and a penny only permitted my traveling by train as far as Two-Mile Stone, and thence I had to walk over the hill—I remember very vividly a little man with a shrill voice who was preaching under a gas-lamp against a hoarding to a thin crowd of Sunday evening loafers.","我从克莱顿峰顶走下来的时候——由于我身上的一先令一便士只够乘火车到二里石，因此我只能走下山来——我脑中生动地记得一个小矮人的形象，他嗓门很尖，在煤气灯下靠着一块张贴栏，在礼拜天晚上跟一小群无业游民布道。"
"He was a short man, bald, with a little fair curly beard and hair and watery blue eyes, and he was preaching that the end of the world drew near.","他个子不高，秃顶，一双水灵的蓝眼睛，留着一小撮卷曲的络腮胡，他正布道说，世界末日就要来临了。"
"I think that is the first time I heard any one link the comet with the end of the world.","我想那是我第一次听人将彗星和世界末日联系在一起。"
"He had got that jumbled up with international politics and prophecies from the Book of Daniel.","他把彗星和《圣经》上的预言和国际政治的东西完全混在了一起。"
"I stopped to hear him only for a moment or so.","我停下来听了一会儿他的布道。"
"I do not think I should have halted at all but his crowd blocked my path, and the sight of his queer wild expression, the gesture of his upward-pointing finger, held me.","我觉得那并不值得停下来仔细听，但他的听众却挡住了我的路，而他奇怪而疯狂的言辞和神情以及朝上指的手指却吸引了我。"
"“There is the end of all your Sins and Follies,” he bawled.","“你们所犯下的所有错误和罪过都要结束了。”他大声喊道，"
"“There!","“看！"
"There is the Star of Judgments, the Judgments of the most High God!","那就是那颗审判之星，代表了至高无上的上帝的审判之星！"
"It is appointed unto all men to die—unto all men to die”—his voice changed to a curious flat chant—“and after death, the Judgment!","它宣判全人类灭亡——全人类灭亡。”——随后他的声音又变得怪异而平和——“灭亡之后，就是最后的审判！"
"The Judgment!”","最后的审判！”"
"I pushed and threaded my way through the bystanders and went on, and his curious harsh flat voice pursued me.","我推开旁观的人群，继续赶路，而他那奇怪、刺耳又平缓的声音却一直追随着我。"
"I went on with the thoughts that had occupied me before—where I could buy a revolver, and how I might master its use—and probably I should have forgotten all about him had he not taken a part in the hideous dream that ended the little sleep I had that night.","我一边继续走，一边思忖着那个我一早就有的念头——在哪儿可以买一把左轮手枪，怎么掌握用法——若不是当天晚上我在噩梦中被他惊醒，彻夜几乎未眠，很可能我应该早就完全把他忘了。"
"For the most part I lay awake thinking of Nettie and her lover.","大多数情况下，我一醒来就会想到妮蒂和她的情人。"
"Then came three strange days—three days that seem now to have been wholly concentrated upon one business.","随后的三天是异常的三天，如今看来，我这三天的精力完全集中在一件事情上了。"
"This dominant business was the purchase of my revolver.","这件主要的事情就是购买左轮手枪。"
"I held myself resolutely to the idea that I must either restore myself by some extraordinary act of vigor and violence in Nettie’s eyes or I must kill her.","我决定，我要么以在妮蒂看来是非同寻常的魄力和暴力方式重塑我在她心中的形象，要么就杀了她。"
"I would not let myself fall away from that.","我不会允许自己放弃那个想法的。"
"I felt that if I let this matter pass, my last shred of pride and honor would pass with it, that for the rest of my life I should never deserve the slightest respect or any woman’s love.","我感到，若我让这件事就这么过去，我就连最后一点点自尊和荣誉感都失去了。我的余生中就无法再得到任何一丝一毫的尊重或是另一个女人的爱慕。"
"Pride kept me to my purpose between my gusts of passion.","自尊让我冲动，驱使我去达到目的。"
"Yet it was not easy to buy that revolver.","但买左轮手枪可不是那么容易的事。"
"I had a kind of shyness of the moment when I should have to face the shopman, and I was particularly anxious to have a story ready if he should see fit to ask questions why I bought such a thing.","在不得不面对店员的那一瞬间，我总会产生一种羞怯感。让我尤为担心的是，如果他问我为什么要买这个，我该编个什么样的理由应付过去。"
"I determined to say I was going to Texas, and I thought it might prove useful there.","我决定说我将要去德克萨斯，我想在那里可能用得上这个。"
"Texas in those days had the reputation of a wild lawless land.","在那个时候，德克萨斯是出了名的无法可循的蛮夷之地。"
"As I knew nothing of caliber or impact, I wanted also to be able to ask with a steady face at what distance a man or woman could be killed by the weapon that might be offered me.","鉴于我对口径或威力这种东西一无所知，我也想一脸镇定地询问能够提供给我的枪支能在多少距离之内射杀一个人。"
"I was pretty cool-headed in relation to such practical aspects of my affair.","在处理这种比较实际的问题时，我一向是比较冷静的。"
"I had some little difficulty in finding a gunsmith.","我颇费周折地找到一位军械工人。"
"In Clayton there were some rook-rifles and so forth in a cycle shop, but the only revolvers these people had impressed me as being too small and toylike for my purpose.","克莱顿有家连锁店里也出售几种小口径步枪之类的枪械，但那对我来说太小了，简直就像个玩具，达不到我的要求。"
"It was in a pawnshop window in the narrow High Street of Swathinglea that I found my choice, a reasonably clumsy and serious-looking implement ticketed “As used in the American army.”","我在斯瓦辛格利狭窄的长街上找到了我想要的枪，虽然做工粗陋，但价格合理，看上去还像那么回事儿，上面印着“美军专用”的字眼。"
"I had drawn out my balance from the savings bank, matter of two pounds and more, to make this purchase, and I found it at last a very easy transaction.","我从储蓄银行里将我的积蓄取出来，大概两英镑多一点儿，然后买下了它。我这才发觉原来买枪是件这么容易的事儿。"
"The pawnbroker told me where I could get ammunition, and I went home that night with bulging pockets, an armed man.","当铺的老板告诉了我可以买弹药的地方，那天晚上回到家的时候，我的口袋已塞满了弹药，再也不是手无寸铁的人了。"
"The purchase of my revolver was, I say, the chief business of those days, but you must not think I was so intent upon it as to be insensible to the stirring things that were happening in the streets through which I went seeking the means to effect my purpose.","买左轮手枪这事儿对我来说确实是那几天做的一件大事儿，但如果你认为我一心只想着这事儿，而对大街上发生的激动人心的事情毫不知情的话，那你就错了。事实上，正是通过这些事情，我才找到了达到自己目的的方式。"
"They were full of murmurings: the whole region of the Four Towns scowled lowering from its narrow doors.","整个四镇地区的人们都窃窃私语，从在门缝中传出的抱怨声也在减弱。"
"The ordinary healthy flow of people going to work, people going about their business, was chilled and checked.","正常健康的人们出去工作或做他们自己的事情的时候，都心神不宁，备受监视。"
"Numbers of men stood about the streets in knots and groups, as corpuscles gather and catch in the blood-vessels in the opening stages of inflammation.","很多人在大街上三五成群地聚在一起，如同在开放性炎症中聚集在血管中的血细胞一样。"
"The woman looked haggard and worried.","女人们面容枯槁，忧心忡忡。"
"The ironworkers had refused the proposed reduction of their wages, and the lockout had begun.","炼铁工人们拒绝接受下调他们工资的建议，于是封厂便开始了。"
"They were already at “play.”","他们已然开始“玩”了。"
"The Conciliation Board was doing its best to keep the coal-miners and masters from a breach, but young Lord Redcar, the greatest of our coal owners and landlord of all Swathinglea and half Clayton, was taking a fine upstanding attitude that made the breach inevitable.","安抚委员会正竭尽全力阻止煤矿工人和矿主发生冲突，但年轻的雷德卡勋爵——全区最大的煤矿主和全斯瓦辛格利和半个克莱顿的地主——态度蛮横坚硬，使冲突变得无法避免。"
"He was a handsome young man, a gallant young man; his pride revolted at the idea of being dictated to by a “lot of bally miners,” and he meant, he said, to make a fight for it.","雷德卡勋爵是一位帅气的年轻人，颇有骑士风范，他的自尊不允许他受“大量矿工”的支配，他的意思是，他要为此而反抗。"
"The world had treated him sumptuously from his earliest years; the shares in the common stock of five thousand people had gone to pay for his handsome upbringing, and large, romantic, expensive ambitions filled his generously nurtured mind.","从他很小的时候起，这个世界就对他相当慷慨。有五千人的普通股份都用来支付他所受的良好教育，他那被精心培养的思想中充斥着巨大、浪漫而奢侈的野心。"
"He had early distinguished himself at Oxford by his scornful attitude towards democracy.","他早就因蔑视民主而在牛津大学扬名。"
"There was something that appealed to the imagination in his fine antagonism to the crowd—on the one hand, was the brilliant young nobleman, picturesquely alone; on the other, the ugly, inexpressive multitude, dressed inelegantly in shop-clothes, under-educated, under-fed, envious, base, and with a wicked disinclination for work and a wicked appetite for the good things it could so rarely get.","在他以大众为敌的做派中有种想象力的因素在作怪。一方面，他是一位满腹经纶的贵族，孤芳自赏。而另一方面，在他看来，那些普通大众淡漠无情、居心叵测、穿着不雅、没有教养、嫉妒心强、痛恨工作、不懂得珍惜来之不易的好东西。"
"For common imaginative purposes one left out the policeman from the design, the stalwart policeman protecting his lordship, and ignored the fact that while Lord Redcar had his hands immediately and legally on the workman’s shelter and bread, they could touch him to the skin only by some violent breach of the law.","出于共同的富有想象力的目的，这个想法在一开始就忽视了警察，那些高大威猛的警察是贵族权利的保护者。同时，也忽视了一个事实：雷德卡勋爵已经直接而合法地干预了工人的衣食住行，如果工人们要反抗他，只能通过一些暴力而不合法的行为。"
"He lived at Lowchester House, five miles or so beyond Checkshill; but partly to show how little he cared for his antagonists, and partly no doubt to keep himself in touch with the negotiations that were still going on, he was visible almost every day in and about the Four Towns, driving that big motor car of his that could take him sixty miles an hour.","他住在距克希利约五英里远的罗切斯特大楼，也许是为了表现出他完全没有把对手放在心上，抑或是为了确保自己能及时了解正在进行的谈判的进展，人们几乎每天都能看见他开着那辆时速可达60英里的大型轿车在四镇里或者四镇附近转悠。"
"The English passion for fair play one might have thought sufficient to rob this bold procedure of any dangerous possibilities, but he did not go altogether free from insult, and on one occasion at least an intoxicated Irish woman shook her fist at him....","根据英国人公平竞争的意识，也许有人愿意冒一切危险来打劫这个冒失鬼，而他也不可能完全不受突然袭击的影响，至少有一次，一个醉酒的爱尔兰女人就对他挥起了拳头……"
"A dark, quiet crowd, that was greater each day, a crowd more than half women, brooded as a cloud will sometimes brood permanently upon a mountain crest, in the market-place outside the Clayton Town Hall, where the conference was held....","黑压压的、安静的人群，人数逐日增多，多半是妇女们，像有时候总笼罩在山头的黑云一样，徘徊在克莱顿镇政府大厅外的市场上，而政府厅内正在开会……"
"I consider myself justified in regarding Lord Redcar’s passing automobile with a special animosity because of the leaks in our roof.","因为我们家的房顶漏水，因此，在雷德卡勋爵的轿车经过时，我投以异常愤恨的目光这一行为在我看来是合理的。"
"We held our little house on lease; the owner was a mean, saving old man named Pettigrew, who lived in a villa adorned with plaster images of dogs and goats, at Overcastle, and in spite of our specific agreement, he would do no repairs for us at all.","我家的房子很小，而且是租来的，房主是一位吝啬而节俭的老人，名叫佩蒂格鲁。他住在奥弗卡斯尔一幢别墅里，里面装饰着小狗和山羊的石膏像。虽然我们对屋顶漏水极为不满，可他丝毫没有为我们修补的意思。"
"He rested secure in my mother’s timidity.","他知道我母亲胆小怕事。"
"Once, long ago, she had been behind-hand with her rent, with half of her quarter’s rent, and he had extended the days of grace a month; her sense that some day she might need the same mercy again made her his abject slave.","很久前曾有一次，母亲的房租迟交了一阵子，还只是一个季度租金的一半，他把交租期延迟了一个月。她总觉得，总有一天，她会再次需要这样的怜悯，而她自己也终会沦为他可怜的奴隶。"
"She was afraid even to ask that he should cause the roof to be mended for fear he might take offence.","她甚至不敢问他是不是该把屋顶修一下，因为怕冒犯了他。"
"But one night the rain poured in on her bed and gave her a cold, and stained and soaked her poor old patchwork counterpane.","但是有天晚上，大雨席卷，打湿了她的床铺，她因此而感冒，她那床破旧、满是补丁的床罩也变得脏兮兮、湿漉漉的。"
"Then she got me to compose an excessively polite letter to old Pettigrew, begging him as a favor to perform his legal obligations.","于是她叫我拟了一封给老佩蒂格鲁的信，措辞极为礼貌，请求他帮忙，履行他的法律义务。"
"It is part of the general imbecility of those days that such one-sided law as existed was a profound mystery to the common people, its provisions impossible to ascertain, its machinery impossible to set in motion.","这部分归咎于当时普遍的愚昧，对于普通民众来讲，那种既有的片面的法律晦涩难懂，根本无法确定具体条例的意思，更不用说运行机制了。"
"Instead of the clearly written code, the lucid statements of rules and principles that are now at the service of every one, the law was the muddle secret of the legal profession.","相比于那些清晰明了的条文，白纸黑字的规定倒是简单易懂的，而且这些法则现在是为大家服务，而所谓法律仅仅是法律从业者的秘诀。"
"Poor people, overworked people, had constantly to submit to petty wrongs because of the intolerable uncertainty not only of law but of cost, and of the demands upon time and energy, proceedings might make.","可怜而过度操劳的人们常不得不服从那些无足轻重的错误决断，因为不仅法律是不可容忍且不确定的，而且打官司的费用、所需要的时间和精力以及起诉的过程等等都是未知的。"
"There was indeed no justice for any one too poor to command a good solicitor’s deference and loyalty; there was nothing but rough police protection and the magistrate’s grudging or eccentric advice for the mass of the population.","的确，对于任何过于穷困的人来说，要求律师的竭力辩护和忠诚都是不公平的。除了警察粗暴的保护和地方官对于普通民众的不情愿而奇怪的建议之外，他们便一无所有。"
"The civil law, in particular, was a mysterious upper-class weapon, and I can imagine no injustice that would have been sufficient to induce my poor old mother to appeal to it.","特别是民法，那就是上层阶级的神秘武器，而我也可以想象没有什么不公能足以吸引我可怜的老母亲对那产生兴趣。"
"All this begins to sound incredible.","这一切听起来都太不可思议了。"
"I can only assure you that it was so.","我只能向你保证，这些都是事实。"
"But I, when I learned that old Pettigrew had been down to tell my mother all about his rheumatism, to inspect the roof, and to allege that nothing was needed, gave way to my most frequent emotion in those days, a burning indignation, and took the matter into my own hands.","但是，当我知道老佩蒂格鲁已经下来告诉我的母亲，他本人患有风湿病，并查看过屋顶，认为没必要修补时，我那时惯常的情绪——一种义愤填膺的情绪占据了我，我决定用我的方式来解决这件事。"
"I wrote and asked him, with a withering air of technicality, to have the roof repaired “as per agreement,” and added, “if not done in one week from now we shall be obliged to take proceedings.”","我给他写了封信。信中，我用法律术语告知他，要求他“按照协议”修补屋顶，并附了一句：“自今日起，若一周之内不付诸行动，我们将提出诉讼。”"
"I had not mentioned this high line of conduct to my mother at first, and so when old Pettigrew came down in a state of great agitation with my letter in his hand, she was almost equally agitated.","我开始并没有将这一高调举措告诉母亲，因此当老佩蒂格鲁手里拿着我的信情绪激动地走下来时，我的母亲几乎和他一样不安。"
"“How could you write to old Mr. Pettigrew like that?”","“你怎么能给老佩蒂格鲁先生写这样的信呢？”"
"she asked me.","她问我。"
"I said that old Pettigrew was a shameful old rascal, or words to that effect, and I am afraid I behaved in a very undutiful way to her when she said that she had settled everything with him—she wouldn’t say how, but I could guess well enough—and that I was to promise her, promise her faithfully, to do nothing more in the matter.","我回答说老佩蒂格鲁就是个无耻混蛋，或诸如此类的一些词。当她告诉我她已经跟他解决好了这件事时，我真怕自己对她做出什么不孝之举来——她不会告诉我她是怎么解决这事的，但我完全猜得到——我准备答应她，发自内心地向她承诺，我以后再也不管这事了。"
"I wouldn’t promise her.","但我并没有那么做。"
"And—having nothing better to employ me then—I presently went raging to old Pettigrew in order to put the whole thing before him in what I considered the proper light.","当时我也没有什么别的好方法，我对老佩蒂格鲁大发雷霆，以我认为恰当的方式将整件事摆在他面前。"
"Old Pettigrew evaded my illumination; he saw me coming up his front steps—I can still see his queer old nose and the crinkled brow over his eye and the little wisp of gray hair that showed over the corner of his window-blind—and he instructed his servant to put up the chain when she answered the door, and to tell me that he would not see me.","老佩蒂格鲁却回避了我的质问，他看着我走上他面前的台阶——我现在还记得很清楚，他那奇怪的老鼻子和眼睛上方起了皱的眉毛，还有那一小卷灰发，像遮光帘一样搭在他的额角——当他的仆人应门时，他吩咐她挂上链条锁，然后告诉我，他不愿意见到我。"
"So I had to fall back upon my pen.","于是我只好再次付诸于笔端。"
"Then it was, as I had no idea what were the proper “proceedings” to take, the brilliant idea occurred to me of appealing to Lord Redcar as the ground landlord, and, as it were, our feudal chief, and pointing out to him that his security for his rent was depreciating in old Pettigrew’s hands.","正当我不知该以何种合适的“程序”起诉时，我灵光一线，那就是我可以向地产拥有者雷德卡勋爵上诉，因为他是我们这个区域封地的领主，向他申诉就等于指出他出租的产业在老佩蒂格鲁手里贬值了。"
"I added some general observations on leaseholds, the taxation of ground rents, and the private ownership of the soil.","我在租赁期里附加了一些一般性资料，比如土地租纳金和土地私有权等。"
"And Lord Redcar, whose spirit revolted at democracy, and who cultivated a pert humiliating manner with his inferiors to show as much, earned my distinguished hatred for ever by causing his secretary to present his compliments to me, and his request that I would mind my own business and leave him to manage his.","雷德卡勋爵从骨子里厌恶民主，总是以带着粗鲁和侮辱的口吻对待他的下级，他的行为体现了这一切，他让秘书向我传达问候的行为激起了我对他永远的刻骨痛恨。他要我管好自己的事情就可以了，他的问题他自己会解决。"
"At which I was so greatly enraged that I first tore this note into minute innumerable pieces, and then dashed it dramatically all over the floor of my room—from which, to keep my mother from the job, I afterward had to pick it up laboriously on all-fours.","这话大大激怒了我，我先把纸撕成碎片，然后将其撒遍我房间里地板的每个角落。而后，为了不给母亲添打扫卫生的麻烦，我又不得不费力地将这些纸屑捡起来。"
"I was still meditating a tremendous retort, an indictment of all Lord Redcar’s class, their manners, morals, economic and political crimes, when my trouble with Nettie arose to swamp all minor troubles.","我依然在计划一次猛烈的反击，去控诉所有和雷德卡勋爵一样的人，控诉他们的行为举止、伦理道德，控诉他们的经济犯罪和政治犯罪。那时我与妮蒂之间矛盾爆发，多少掩盖了所有小的矛盾。"
"Yet, not so completely but that I snarled aloud when his lordship’s motor-car whizzed by me, as I went about upon my long meandering quest for a weapon.","但这些矛盾掩盖得不彻底，当他开着显示他贵族身份的轿车从我身边疾驰而过的时候，我大吼一声，随即开始了购买武器的漫长而曲折的过程。"
"And I discovered after a time that my mother had bruised her knee and was lame.","后来我发觉，我的母亲膝盖红肿，走路一瘸一拐的。"
"Fearing to irritate me by bringing the thing before me again, she had set herself to move her bed out of the way of the drip without my help, and she had knocked her knee.","原来她是怕把这件事情再摆到我面前又会让我大发雷霆，便一个人独自把床搬到雨淋不到的地方，没有让我帮忙，结果自己碰伤了膝盖。"
"All her poor furnishings, I discovered, were cowering now close to the peeling bedroom walls; there had come a vast discoloration of the ceiling, and a washing-tub was in occupation of the middle of her chamber....","现在我发现，她所有的破旧的家具全都靠在卧室剥落的墙边，天花板上湿了一大片，房间中间放着一个浴盆……"
"It is necessary that I should set these things before you, should give the key of inconvenience and uneasiness in which all things were arranged, should suggest the breath of trouble that stirred along the hot summer streets, the anxiety about the strike, the rumors and indignations, the gatherings and meetings, the increasing gravity of the policemen’s faces, the combative headlines of the local papers, the knots of picketers who scrutinized any one who passed near the silent, smokeless forges, but in my mind, you must understand, such impressions came and went irregularly; they made a moving background, changing undertones, to my preoccupation by that darkly shaping purpose to which a revolver was so imperative an essential.","我想有必要让你们知道这些事，这样就可以让你们有这样一个印象。你们可以想象得到，这些东西摆放得多么不方便、不自在，这种摆放能让人联想到夏季炎热的街道那些处处流动着的恼人的氛围、对罢工的焦虑以及各种传言和愤慨，到处都是示威集会游行，警察的脸色越来越凝重，当地报纸的标题尽是挑衅的字眼，一队队的纠察员仔细盘查着每个经过寂静而荒无人烟的铁铺匠的人。而在我看来，你们一定明白，这些都是不正常的现象，它们一起形成了一道流动的风景，底色在不断变化着。依我看，在这种情况下，一把左轮手枪无疑是十分必要的。"
"Along the darkling streets, amidst the sullen crowds, the thought of Nettie, my Nettie, and her gentleman lover made ever a vivid inflammatory spot of purpose in my brain.","在昏暗的街道上，在喁喁前行的人群中，我想起了妮蒂，我的妮蒂，还有她那个颇具绅士风范的情人在我脑中燃起了清晰无比的强烈激情。"
"Section 3","第三节"
"It was three days after this—on Wednesday, that is to say—that the first of those sinister outbreaks occurred that ended in the bloody affair of Peacock Grove and the flooding out of the entire line of the Swathinglea collieries.","这件事情三天以后，也就是星期三，不幸爆发了第一次冲突，酿成了孔雀林流血事件，这一事件蔓延到了整个斯瓦辛格利煤矿。"
"It was the only one of these disturbances I was destined to see, and at most a mere trivial preliminary of that struggle.","这是我注定要亲眼目睹的唯一一次骚乱，这也不过是那场斗争中一次无关紧要的预演而已。"
"The accounts that have been written of this affair vary very widely.","对这次事件的报道众口不一。"
"To read them is to realize the extraordinary carelessness of truth that dishonored the press of those latter days.","读一下相关的报道，就能看到那些日子里人们对待新闻报道不实是何等漫不经心。"
"In my bureau I have several files of the daily papers of the old time—I collected them, as a matter of fact—and three or four of about that date I have just this moment taken out and looked through to refresh my impression of what I saw.","我的办公室里有几份过去的日报——事实上，是我把它们收集起来的——事件发生那天的，大约有三四份。就在刚才我把它们拿出来又浏览了一遍，以便加深我对亲眼所见的事件的印象。"
"They lie before me—queer, shriveled, incredible things; the cheap paper has already become brittle and brown and split along the creases, the ink faded or smeared, and I have to handle them with the utmost care when I glance among their raging headlines.","那些报纸就摆在我面前，皱巴巴的、稀奇古怪、毫无真实可言。那些廉价低劣的报纸已经开始泛黄变脆，沿着折缝裂开，上面的油墨不是褪色就是黑黢黢的一片，以至于我在浏览那些充满火药味的标题时，不得不小心翼翼地翻阅。"
"As I sit here in this serene place, their quality throughout, their arrangement, their tone, their arguments and exhortations, read as though they came from drugged and drunken men.","当我坐在这一片祥和之处阅读这些报纸时，总觉得那贯穿其中的品位、排版、笔者的口气、论证和观点都像是出自瘾君子或是酒鬼之手。"
"They give one the effect of faded bawling, of screams and shouts heard faintly in a little gramophone....","报纸字里行间发出的渐渐削弱的呐喊、尖叫以及怒吼，如同小型留声机上的声音一般越来越微弱。"
"It is only on Monday I find, and buried deep below the war news, that these publications contain any intimation that unusual happenings were forward in Clayton and Swathinglea.","只有到了星期一，我才能发现这些战争报道淹没下的新闻，发现这些出版物中的暗示——克莱顿和斯瓦辛格利即将发生的异常事件。"
"What I saw was towards evening.","我所见到的事情发生在傍晚时分。"
"I had been learning to shoot with my new possession.","我拿着新买的宝贝在联系射击。"
"I had walked out with it four or five miles across a patch of moorland and down to a secluded little coppice full of blue-bells, halfway along the high-road between Leet and Stafford.","我持枪走出了四五英里，穿过一小片沼泽高地，走进一片小灌木丛，那灌木丛位于利特到斯塔福德之间的高速公路上，里面长满了风铃草。"
"Here I had spent the afternoon, experimenting and practising with careful deliberation and grim persistence.","我在这里呆了一个下午，从容而固执地不断试验和练习着射击。"
"I had brought an old kite-frame of cane with me, that folded and unfolded, and each shot-hole I made I marked and numbered to compare with my other endeavors.","我买了一把旧的轻型骨架折叠手杖带在身边，不断重复地打开合上，在地上扎洞，计数，然后再跟其他的洞作比较。"
"At last I was satisfied that I could hit a playing-card at thirty paces nine times out of ten; the light was getting too bad for me to see my penciled bull’s-eye, and in that state of quiet moodiness that sometimes comes with hunger to passionate men, I returned by the way of Swathinglea towards my home.","最后，直到我终于可以从三十步以外打中一张扑克牌，并有九成的成功率时，我才对自己表示满意。天色渐暗，我都看不清我自己用铅笔画出的靶心了，我开始沿着斯瓦辛格利通往我家的路往回走，心情平静而抑郁，这是饥饿而暴躁的男人时而会有的心情。"
"The road I followed came down between banks of wretched-looking working-men’s houses, in close-packed rows on either side, and took upon itself the role of Swathinglea High Street, where, at a lamp and a pillar-box, the steam-trams began.","道路两旁都是破旧不堪的工人住所，密密麻麻地堆在路边，扮演着自己在斯瓦辛格利大街上的角色。大街上有着一盏街灯，一个邮筒，蒸汽矿车就从这里出发。"
"So far that dirty hot way had been unusually quiet and empty, but beyond the corner, where the first group of beershops clustered, it became populous.","目前为止，这条肮脏炎热的道路一直异常安静和空荡，但在街角另一端，啤酒屋林立，人群拥挤，颇为热闹。"
"It was very quiet still, even the children were a little inactive, but there were a lot of people standing dispersedly in little groups, and with a general direction towards the gates of the Bantock Burden coalpit.","街上依旧安静，甚至连小孩子都有些不爱活动。而却有许多人三三两两地站在街上，大部分朝着班托克·布尔登矿井的方向。"
"The place was being picketed, although at that time the miners were still nominally at work, and the conferences between masters and men still in session at Clayton Town Hall.","那个地方正被纠察员戒严，虽然当时矿工们仍旧在正常上班，可克莱顿镇市政大厅却正开着劳工大会。"
"But one of the men employed at the Bantock Burden pit, Jack Briscoe, was a socialist, and he had distinguished himself by a violent letter upon the crisis to the leading socialistic paper in England, The Clarion, in which he had adventured among the motives of Lord Redcar.","班托克·布尔登矿井有一位名叫杰克·布里斯科的矿工，是一名社会主义者，他因在英格兰一份最主要的社会主义性质报纸《号角》上发表了一封言辞激烈的公开信批评这次危机而出名。在信中，他大胆质疑了雷德卡勋爵的动机。"
"The publication of this had been followed by instant dismissal.","公开信一经发表，他立马被开除了。"
"As Lord Redcar wrote a day or so later to the Times—I have that Times, I have all the London papers of the last month before the Change—","因为雷德卡勋爵一天后给《泰晤士报》写了一封信——我有那份报纸，事实上我有巨变前一个月伦敦的所有报纸。那封信上说："
"“The man was paid off and kicked out.","“那个人结算了工资后被炒鱿鱼了。"
"Any self-respecting employer would do the same.”","任何尊重自我的雇主都会这样做。”"
"The thing had happened overnight, and the men did not at once take a clear line upon what was, after all, a very intricate and debatable occasion.","这事情发生得太突然，人们连弄清来龙去脉的时间都没有。毕竟，这是一件错综复杂、颇有争议的事情。"
"But they came out in a sort of semiofficial strike from all Lord Redcar’s collieries beyond the canal that besets Swathinglea.","但是雷德卡勋爵所有煤矿的矿工们开始了半正式形式的罢工，那些煤矿大多集中在环绕斯瓦辛格利水沟外。"
"They did so without formal notice, committing a breach of contract by this sudden cessation.","罢工没有正式宣布就开始了，这种突然停工的方式是违反合同的。"
"But in the long labor struggles of the old days the workers were constantly putting themselves in the wrong and committing illegalities through that overpowering craving for dramatic promptness natural to uneducated minds.","但由于那些教育贫乏的大脑对戏剧性的渴望压倒了一切，因此在过去那种持久的劳工斗争中，工人们常使自己处于不利的位置，做一些不合法的事情。"
"All the men had not come out of the Bantock Burden pit.","没有矿工离开班托克·布尔登矿井。"
"Something was wrong there, an indecision if nothing else; the mine was still working, and there was a rumor that men from Durham had been held in readiness by Lord Redcar, and were already in the mine.","那儿出了点儿事儿，算不上什么大事儿，却也挺棘手。矿井的运作依然如故，有传言说，雷德卡讯军准备要把所有达勒姆来的工人抓起来，作为后备，而井下的人已经在他手上了。"
"Now, it is absolutely impossible to ascertain certainly how things stood at that time.","现在想要准确弄清楚事实已经完全不可能了。"
"The newspapers say this and that, but nothing trustworthy remains.","报纸一会儿一个说法，没什么真实性可言。"
"I believe I should have gone striding athwart the dark stage of that stagnant industrial drama without asking a question, if Lord Redcar had not chanced to come upon the scene about the same time as myself and incontinently end its stagnation.","我想，若不是雷德卡勋爵正巧跟我同时看到了这一情景并不能自制地结束了停滞状态，我本应该沉默不置一词地横穿那个寥无观众的黑暗舞台上的工业戏剧。"
"He had promised that if the men wanted a struggle he would put up the best fight they had ever had, and he had been active all that afternoon in meeting the quarrel half way, and preparing as conspicuously as possible for the scratch force of “blacklegs”—as we called them—who were, he said and we believed, to replace the strikers in his pits.","他曾承诺，若工人们想斗争，他就会奉陪到底，让他们见识见识他的厉害。那天下午他一直十分活跃，忙着应对各种争吵，尽可能引人注目地准备临时武装力量“黑腿”（我们这么称呼他们），他们将取代矿井里罢工的工人们，这是他说的，我们也相信。"
"I was an eye-witness of the whole of the affair outside the Bantock Burden pit, and—I do not know what happened.","我是班托克·布尔登矿井外发生的全部事件的目击者，但我自己都搞不清楚到底发生了什么事情。"
"Picture to yourself how the thing came to me.","请你试着描述一下我当时所看到的一切。"
"I was descending a steep, cobbled, excavated road between banked-up footways, perhaps six feet high, upon which, in a monotonous series, opened the living room doors of rows of dark, low cottages.","我沿着一条陡峭的小路向下走，那路是用鹅卵石铺成、在堆积的人行道上开出来的，大约有六英尺高，路上是一排排式样单一又黑又矮的小屋，屋门大敞着。"
"The perspective of squat blue slate roofs and clustering chimneys drifted downward towards the irregular open space before the colliery—a space covered with coaly, wheel-scarred mud, with a patch of weedy dump to the left and the colliery gates to the right.","暗蓝灰色低矮的石板屋和林立的烟囱从煤矿前飘散开来，飘向不规则的开放的空间，空中弥漫着黑色的烟尘和煤灰，左边是杂草丛生的垃圾堆，右边是煤矿大门。"
"Beyond, the High Street with shops resumed again in good earnest and went on, and the lines of the steam-tramway that started out from before my feet, and were here shining and acutely visible with reflected skylight and here lost in a shadow, took up for one acute moment the greasy yellow irradiation of a newly lit gaslamp as they vanished round the bend.","远处，满是商场的大街又恢复了原有的活力，变得热闹起来，脚下延伸着的是蒸汽机车的行驶路线，它清晰地反射着闪烁的天光，然后消失在阴影里。新点燃的煤气灯时不时发出油腻的黄色光线，而后渐隐在拐角里。"
"Beyond, spread a darkling marsh of homes, an infinitude of little smoking hovels, and emergent, meager churches, public-houses, board schools, and other buildings amidst the prevailing chimneys of Swathinglea.","再远一点儿是黑暗笼罩的住所、冒着炊烟却望不见边小茅棚、突兀地耸立着的穷酸教堂、小旅店、寄宿学校以及其他一些夹杂在斯瓦辛格利林立的烟囱之间的建筑。"
"To the right, very clear and relatively high, the Bantock Burden pit-mouth was marked by a gaunt lattice bearing a great black wheel, very sharp and distinct in the twilight, and beyond, in an irregular perspective, were others following the lie of the seams.","右侧是一个光秃秃的格架，上面挂着一只硕大的黑色轮子，轮子上勾勒出了班托克·布尔登矿井井口的位置，那位置偏高，但十分突出，在暮色中清晰可见。上面，从不规整的视角看，其他风景大多是沿着煤层分布的。"
"The general effect, as one came down the hill, was of a dark compressed life beneath a very high and wide and luminous evening sky, against which these pit-wheels rose.","从山包上下来，整体给人的印象是一幅模糊而浓缩的生活图画，上面是深邃广袤而星光闪闪的夜空，煤矿的那些大轮子便映衬在夜空中。"
"And ruling the calm spaciousness of that heaven was the great comet, now green-white, and wonderful for all who had eyes to see.","这平静而广袤天空的统治者就是巨大的彗星，如今它呈现出一种绿白色，令人叹为观止。"
"The fading afterglow of the sunset threw up all the contours and skyline to the west, and the comet rose eastward out of the pouring tumult of smoke from Bladden’s forges.","夕阳的余晖渐渐退去，为西方地平线和万物的轮廓线抹上一缕金色，彗星从东方升起，与布莱顿铁匠铺的滚滚浓烟渐行渐远。"
"The moon had still to rise.","月亮仍在升起。"
"By this time the comet had begun to assume the cloudlike form still familiar through the medium of a thousand photographs and sketches.","这时，彗星已经开始呈现出云的形状。通过无数照片和素描，它依然还是那么熟悉。"
"At first it had been an almost telescopic speck; it had brightened to the dimensions of the greatest star in the heavens; it had still grown, hour by hour, in its incredibly swift, its noiseless and inevitable rush upon our earth, until it had equaled and surpassed the moon.","起初，它曾是一颗只能用望远镜才能观测到的微小的点；它曾使天空中最大星星所能照到的地方都熠熠发光；而后它越来越大，每一时每一刻以令人不可思议的速度迅速增大，它无声无息、无可避免地冲向地球，直到它与月亮同样大小，直到最后超过月球。"
"Now it was the most splendid thing this sky of earth has ever held.","目前为止，那是这个地球之上的天空所呈现的最壮观的事物了。"
"I have never seen a photograph that gave a proper idea of it.","我从未看到过一幅照片能够准确描述它的。"
"Never at any time did it assume the conventional tailed outline, comets are supposed to have.","无论何时，它都从未有过传统中彗星应有的尾状轮廓。"
"Astronomers talked of its double tail, one preceding it and one trailing behind it, but these were foreshortened to nothing, so that it had rather the form of a bellying puff of luminous smoke with an intenser, brighter heart.","天文学家们探讨了它的两条彗尾，一前一后，可这两条彗尾按照透视法被缩短到不可见了，因此，它就形成了一团膨胀而发亮的烟雾，其中中间那块尤其明亮。"
"It rose a hot yellow color, and only began to show its distinctive greenness when it was clear of the mists of the evening.","它发出炽热的黄光，仅在在黑夜的薄雾里，那独特的绿色才开始清晰可见。"
"It compelled attention for a space.","它强烈地吸引着空间的注意力。"
"For all my earthly concentration of mind, I could but stare at it for a moment with a vague anticipation that, after all, in some way so strange and glorious an object must have significance, could not possibly be a matter of absolute indifference to the scheme and values of my life.","我将自己对地球知识全部浓缩于脑中，却只能带着蒙眬的预感注视它一会儿，从某种程度上说，这样一个陌生而光辉的物体一定是有重要意义的，是我生命的进程和价值观所不可能忽视的。"
"But how?","但这到底是怎么回事呢？"
"I thought of Parload.","我想起了帕罗德。"
"I thought of the panic and uneasiness that was spreading in this very matter, and the assurances of scientific men that the thing weighed so little—at the utmost a few hundred tons of thinly diffused gas and dust—that even were it to smite this earth fully, nothing could possibly ensue.","我想起人们对彗星的恐慌和焦虑还有科学家们的保证，他们说这颗彗星的重量很轻，最多只有几百吨，就算扩散成稀薄的气体和灰尘全部撞在地球上，也不会产生什么必然的后果。"
"And, after all, said I, what earthly significance has any one found in the stars?","但是，我还是要问，究竟又有谁研究过地球在星球中的重要性？"
"Then, as one still descended, the houses and buildings rose up, the presence of those watching groups of people, the tension of the situation; and one forgot the sky.","接着，随着人从山上走下来，房屋和建筑都变得高大起来，到处都是观望的人群，形势紧张了起来，而天空似乎都被人忘记了。"
"Preoccupied with myself and with my dark dream about Nettie and my honor, I threaded my course through the stagnating threat of this gathering, and was caught unawares, when suddenly the whole scene flashed into drama....","我全神贯注地想着自己，想着有关妮蒂的梦境，想着我自己的自尊心，我将自己的事业贯穿于聚集在一起的凶兆，不知不觉的入迷了，一刹那间，所有的情节都变成了戏剧……"
"The attention of every one swung round with an irresistible magnetism towards the High Street, and caught me as a rush of waters might catch a wisp of hay.","每个人的注意力都围绕着那条街，带着无法抗拒的吸引力，那吸引力携着我，像是一股洪流携着一小束甘草。"
"Abruptly the whole crowd was sounding one note.","突然所有的人群整齐地发出一个声音。"
"It was not a word, it was a sound that mingled threat and protest, something between a prolonged “Ah!”","不是一句话，是一个声音，那声音中混含着威胁和抗议，有些像拖长的一声“啊！”"
"and “Ugh!”","和“呸！”"
"Then with a hoarse intensity of anger came a low heavy booing, “Boo!","接着又是一声带着强烈的愤怒和低沉嘶吼：“呸！"
"boo—oo!”","呸——哦！”"
"a note stupidly expressive of animal savagery.","这声音似乎是一种困兽般的愚蠢发泄。"
"“Toot, toot!”","“嘟嘟！”"
"said Lord Redcar’s automobile in ridiculous repartee.","传来了雷德卡勋爵的轿车声，好像是一种可笑的回应。"
"“Toot, toot!”","“嘟嘟！”"
"One heard it whizzing and throbbing as the crowd obliged it to slow down.","因为人群减慢了车的速度，所以人们听到了它鸣喇叭，发动机轰轰作响的声音。"
"Everybody seemed in motion towards the colliery gates, I, too, with the others.","每个人似乎都在向煤矿大门移动，我也随着大家一起移动。"
"I heard a shout.","我听见一声叫喊。"
"Through the dark figures about me I saw the motor-car stop and move forward again, and had a glimpse of something writhing on the ground.","通过周围黑压压的人群，我看见停下来的汽车又向前开去，司机还瞥了一眼在地上翻滚着的什么东西。"
"It was alleged afterwards that Lord Redcar was driving, and that he quite deliberately knocked down a little boy who would not get out of his way.","后来有人声称，开车的人就是雷德卡勋爵本人，而且还说，他故意撞倒了一个小男孩，因为那孩子挡了他的路。"
"It is asserted with equal confidence that the boy was a man who tried to pass across the front of the motor-car as it came slowly through the crowd, who escaped by a hair’s breadth, and then slipped on the tram-rail and fell down.","也有人言之凿凿地说，那个被撞的孩子其实是个男人，在轿车缓缓穿过人群时试图从车前方跑过，差点儿被撞倒，然后就在车轮前滑倒了。"
"I have both accounts set forth, under screaming headlines, in two of these sere newspapers upon my desk.","刊登这两种报道的报纸我都有，现在就摆在我的写字台上，两份旧报纸上都印着惊人的大标题。"
"No one could ever ascertain the truth.","没有人能确认事情的真相。"
"Indeed, in such a blind tumult of passion, could there be any truth?","确实，在这样一种盲目冲动和混乱中，又有什么真相可言呢？"
"There was a rush forward, the horn of the car sounded, everything swayed violently to the right for perhaps ten yards or so, and there was a report like a pistol-shot.","人群向前涌去，轿车喇叭轰鸣，马路上的人和车在剧烈的动荡中向右偏了约有十码，还似乎传来了手枪的枪击声。"
"For a moment every one seemed running away.","转瞬间，人人似乎都在逃命。"
"A woman, carrying a shawl-wrapped child, blundered into me, and sent me reeling back.","一位妇女抱着一个用围巾包着的婴儿撞在了我身上，把我撞得摇晃着退了好几步。"
"Every one thought of firearms, but, as a matter of fact, something had gone wrong with the motor, what in those old-fashioned contrivances was called a backfire.","每个人都觉得是枪声，但其实不过是汽车出了故障，按老式的机械装置的说法，那叫做回火。"
"A thin puff of bluish smoke hung in the air behind the thing.","汽车后部在空气中散开一股薄薄的蓝色的烟气。"
"The majority of the people scattered back in a disorderly fashion, and left a clear space about the struggle that centered upon the motor-car.","大部分的人们都无序地退后，留下中间的一片空地上，停着那辆轿车和还在争执的人们。"
"The man or boy who had fallen was lying on the ground with no one near him, a black lump, an extended arm and two sprawling feet.","那个被撞的男孩或男人躺在空地上，身边空无一人，他一只胳膊伸开，两脚蹬直，旁边是一大块积血。"
"The motor-car had stopped, and its three occupants were standing up.","车已经停了下来，车里的三名乘客全都站了出来。"
"Six or seven black figures surrounded the car, and appeared to be holding on to it as if to prevent it from starting again; one—it was Mitchell, a well-known labor leader—argued in fierce low tones with Lord Redcar.","六七个黑影围住了汽车，明显是在阻止它再次发动，一个人——米切尔，著名的劳工领袖——正用低沉的声音跟雷德卡勋爵激烈地争辩。"
"I could not hear anything they said, I was not near enough.","由于我离得太远，完全听不到他们在争论些什么。"
"Behind me the colliery gates were open, and there was a sense of help coming to the motor-car from that direction.","我身后的煤矿大门大敞着，从那个方向冲出来一批援军。"
"There was an unoccupied muddy space for fifty yards, perhaps, between car and gate, and then the wheels and head of the pit rose black against the sky.","汽车和煤矿大门之间有一块约五十码的泥泞的空地，随后那些轮子和矿主的影子就黑乎乎地出现在天空下。"
"I was one of a rude semicircle of people that hung as yet indeterminate in action about this dispute.","我周围的人群差不多站成一个半圆形，迟疑着不知该对这场争吵采取何种行动。"
"It was natural, I suppose, that my fingers should close upon the revolver in my pocket.","我觉得，在那时我的手指应该紧紧抓住口袋里那支左轮手枪，这是再自然不过的事情了。"
"I advanced with the vaguest intentions in the world, and not so quickly but that several men hurried past me to join the little knot holding up the car.","我怀着模糊的意图向前走去，走得不算太快，有几个人急急忙忙地超到我前面去，加入了阻止汽车发动的那一小伙人中。"
"Lord Redcar, in his big furry overcoat, towered up over the group about him; his gestures were free and threatening, and his voice loud.","人群之中，雷德卡勋爵穿着皮草大衣鹤立于中央，手势很随便，用他的大嗓门恐吓着人群。"
"He made a fine figure there, I must admit; he was a big, fair, handsome young man with a fine tenor voice and an instinct for gallant effect.","我必须承认，他在那儿打了一个相当漂亮的手势。他身材威武，皮肤白皙，英俊潇洒，有着男高音般的嗓门，从骨子里透出一种骑士风范。"
"My eyes were drawn to him at first wholly.","一开始，我的眼睛完全被他吸引了。"
"He seemed a symbol, a triumphant symbol, of all that the theory of aristocracy claims, of all that filled my soul with resentment.","他似乎就是一个符号，一个成功的符号，一个贵族统治理论的象征，也是我灵魂深处充斥着的一切怨恨的象征。"
"His chauffeur sat crouched together, peering at the crowd under his lordship’s arm.","他的司机蜷缩着坐在一边，窥探着勋爵臂膀下的人群。"
"But Mitchell showed as a sturdy figure also, and his voice was firm and loud.","而米切尔的身躯也是同样刚毅，他的声音也是同样的坚定和洪亮。"
"“You’ve hurt that lad,” said Mitchell, over and over again.","“你撞了那个少年，”米切尔一遍又一遍地说道，"
"“You’ll wait here till you see if he’s hurt.”","“你必须在这里等着，看看他是否受伤了。”"
"“I’ll wait here or not as I please,” said Redcar; and to the chauffeur, “Here!","“我在不在这里等着，完全由我的意愿决定。”雷德卡勋爵说，而后转向他的司机说道，“喂！"
"get down and look at it!”","下车去看看！”"
"“You’d better not get down,” said Mitchell; and the chauffeur stood bent and hesitating on the step.","“你最好坐在那儿别动。”米切尔说，那司机弯着腰站在汽车踏板上，不知该听谁的。"
"The man on the back seat stood up, leant forward, and spoke to Lord Redcar, and for the first time my attention was drawn to him.","后排上坐着的人站起来，向前探着身子，跟雷德卡勋爵说了些什么。那是我第一次将注意力转到他的身上。"
"It was young Verrall!","那是小维罗尔！"
"His handsome face shone clear and fine in the green pallor of the comet.","他英俊的脸在彗星绿白色的光芒下显得容光焕发。"
"I ceased to hear the quarrel that was raising the voice of Mitchell and Lord Redcar.","米切尔和雷德卡的争吵声愈来愈大，而我那时却什么都听不到了。"
"This new fact sent them spinning into the background.","眼前的新情况将那一切争吵声都化成了背景的噪声。"
"Young Verrall!","小维罗尔！"
"It was my own purpose coming to meet me half way.","我的终极目标在这里不请自来了。"
"There was to be a fight here, it seemed certain to come to a scuffle, and here we were—","这儿将会发生战斗，似乎注定要有这样一场混战，我们在这里——"
"What was I to do?","我该怎么办？"
"I thought very swiftly.","我迅速思考着。"
"Unless my memory cheats me, I acted with swift decision.","除非记忆欺骗了我，那时我迅速做出了决定。"
"My hand tightened on my revolver, and then I remembered it was unloaded.","我的手紧握着左轮手枪，然后想起枪里没装子弹。"
"I had thought my course out in an instant.","我在一瞬间便想好了行动方案。"
"I turned round and pushed my way out of the angry crowd that was now surging back towards the motor-car.","我转过身去，挤出正向轿车蜂拥而来的愤怒的人群。"
"It would be quiet and out of sight, I thought, among the dump heaps across the road, and there I might load unobserved...","我想，马路对面的垃圾堆处应该是相对安静且不受注意的，我也许可以在那儿装子弹……"
"A big young man striding forward with his fists clenched, halted for one second at the sight of me.","一个身材魁梧的小伙子紧握着双拳，大步向前赶，可他看到我之后却停了一秒钟。"
"“What!”","“喂！”"
"said he.","他说，"
"“Ain’t afraid of them, are you?”","“你该不会是怕了他们吧，是吗？”"
"I glanced over my shoulder and back at him, was near showing him my pistol, and the expression changed in his eyes.","我回头瞥了他一眼，差点儿给他看看我的手枪，这时他目光中的神情却变了。"
"He hung perplexed at me.","他有些困惑地盯着我。"
"Then with a grunt he went on.","之后咕哝了一句什么就继续向前赶了。"
"I heard the voices growing loud and sharp behind me.","我听到背后的声音越来越大，越来越尖锐。"
"I hesitated, half turned towards the dispute, then set off running towards the heaps.","我迟疑了一会儿，半转身面对争论中的人群，接着又奔向垃圾堆。"
"Some instinct told me not to be detected loading.","我的本能告诉我，装子弹这种事是不能让别人看见的。"
"I was cool enough therefore to think of the aftermath of the thing I meant to do.","我十分冷静，我知道我要做的事情所能产生的后果。"
"I looked back once again towards the swaying discussion—or was it a fight now?","我又一次转头望了望吵嚷的人群——他们这会儿该不会打起来吧？"
"and then I dropped into the hollow, knelt among the weeds, and loaded with eager trembling fingers.","而后我走进洼地，跪在杂草中，颤抖着迫不及待地上好了子弹。"
"I loaded one chamber, got up and went back a dozen paces, thought of possibilities, vacillated, returned and loaded all the others.","我装上弹夹，直起身来，思忖着将有可能出现的状况，稍作犹豫，又转回去把所有剩下的子弹都装进了枪膛。"
"I did it slowly because I felt a little clumsy, and at the end came a moment of inspection—had I forgotten any thing?","我慢慢地装着，感觉手有些不听使唤，最后又复查了一遍，看看是否漏掉了什么。"
"And then for a few seconds I crouched before I rose, resisting the first gust of reaction against my impulse.","之后在我站起来之前，我又蹲了一会儿，以抑制自己内心冲动而产生的第一次爆发。"
"I took thought, and for a moment that great green-white meteor overhead swam back into my conscious mind.","我思考着，那一瞬间，头顶那个绿白色的巨大彗星重新回到了我的潜意识中。"
"For the first time then I linked it clearly with all the fierce violence that had crept into human life.","那一刻，我第一次把它与人类生活中的各种残忍的暴行清晰地联系在一起。"
"I joined up that with what I meant to do.","我把它与我打算要做的事情联系起来。"
"I was going to shoot young Verrall as it were under the benediction of that green glare.","我要去枪杀小维罗尔，似乎这件事是被那炫目辉煌的绿色光芒所庇佑。"
"But about Nettie?","但妮蒂呢？"
"I found it impossible to think out that obvious complication.","我觉得在这种复杂的情况下理出头绪简直是件不可能的事情。"
"I came up over the heap again, and walked slowly back towards the wrangle.","我再次爬上垃圾堆，朝着争吵的人群缓缓走去。"
"Of course I had to kill him....","当然，我必须杀了他。"
"Now I would have you believe I did not want to murder young Verrall at all at that particular time.","而现在我宁愿让你们相信，在当时那种特殊的情况下，我根本就不想去谋杀小维罗尔。"
"I had not pictured such circumstances as these, I had never thought of him in connection with Lord Redcar and our black industrial world.","那时我还没有想好具体的枪杀细节，也从未想过要把他和雷德卡勋爵以及我们那个黑暗腐败的产业联系在一起。"
"He was in that distant other world of Checkshill, the world of parks and gardens, the world of sunlit emotions and Nettie.","他处于不同于切克希利的另一个遥远的世界上，那是花园与公园的世界，那是充满阳光还有妮蒂的感情世界。"
"His appearance here was disconcerting.","他出现在这里令我不知所措。"
"I was taken by surprise.","我惊慌不已。"
"I was too tired and hungry to think clearly, and the hard implication of our antagonism prevailed with me.","我疲惫不堪，饥饿难耐，脑中一片混乱，那些敌对情绪所产生的艰涩暗示萦绕在心间。"
"In the tumult of my passed emotions I had thought constantly of conflicts, confrontations, deeds of violence, and now the memory of these things took possession of me as though they were irrevocable resolutions.","在我过去经历过的冲动的情绪中，我曾常想过矛盾、敌对、暴力，这些回忆而今占据了我所有的思绪，它们似乎就是下定决心来纠缠我一般，挥之不去，无法阻挡。"
"There was a sharp exclamation, the shriek of a woman, and the crowd came surging back.","人群中传来一声尖叫，那是一个女人的尖叫，而后人流回涌。"
"The fight had begun.","争斗开始了。"
"Lord Redcar, I believe, had jumped down from his car and felled Mitchell, and men were already running out to his assistance from the colliery gates.","我想雷德卡勋爵是从车上跳了下来，直接向米切尔扑去，矿工们从煤矿大门蜂拥而出，前去增援。"
"I had some difficulty in shoving through the crowd; I can still remember very vividly being jammed at one time between two big men so that my arms were pinned to my sides, but all the other details are gone out of my mind until I found myself almost violently projected forward into the “scrap.”","我想要从人群中挤过去，但是很难。到现在我依然清楚地记得，我一度被夹在两个高大的男人之间，双臂被挤得紧贴着身体两次，至于其他细节我都想不起来了，直到我发现自己差点儿被人挤到“废墟”里去。"
"I blundered against the corner of the motor-car, and came round it face to face with young Verrall, who was descending from the back compartment.","我跌跌撞撞地撞到了汽车的边上，正好和小维罗尔打了个照面，他正从后边的座位向车下走。"
"His face was touched with orange from the automobile’s big lamps, which conflicted with the shadows of the comet light, and distorted him oddly.","汽车的大灯给他的脸涂上了一层橘黄色，正好跟彗星的阴影形成对比，将他的面目奇怪地扭曲了。"
"That effect lasted but an instant, but it put me out.","这种效果只持续了一会儿，但却激怒了我。"
"Then he came a step forward, and the ruddy lights and queerness vanished.","之后他上前一步，那暗红的光线和奇怪的感觉便消失了。"
"I don’t think he recognized me, but he perceived immediately I meant attacking.","我想他并没有认出我，但他马上察觉到我将要袭击他。"
"He struck out at once at me a haphazard blow, and touched me on the cheek.","他立刻挥起拳头，一拳打在我的脸颊上。"
"Instinctively I let go of the pistol, snatched my right hand out of my pocket and brought it up in a belated parry, and then let out with my left full in his chest.","我本能地放开手枪，把握紧的右手从衣袋里抽出来，甩出迟来的一击，然后左手当胸给了他一拳。"
"It sent him staggering, and as he went back I saw recognition mingle with astonishment in his face.","他跌跌撞撞地向后退去，等他回身时，我从他掺着惊讶的神情中察觉到，他已经认出我来了。"
"“You know me, you swine,” I cried and hit again.","“你认识我，你这只猪猡。”我大喊一声，再次向他挥拳。"
"Then I was spinning sideways, half-stunned, with a huge lump of a fist under my jaw.","紧接着他一拳打在我下巴上，我被打得晕头转向，倒向路边。"
"I had an impression of Lord Redcar as a great furry bulk, towering like some Homeric hero above the fray.","我曾觉得雷德卡勋爵是一位像荷马史诗中的英雄一样，满身汗毛，高大威武，如同铁塔一般屹立。"
"I went down before him—it made him seem to rush up—and he ignored me further.","我倒在他面前，这几乎让他跳了起来，之后，他没再理会过我。"
"His big flat voice counseled young Verrall—","他用平淡的语调对小维罗尔大喊道——"
"“Cut, Teddy!","“快走，特迪！"
"It won’t do.","那没用。"
"The picketa’s got i’on bahs....”","纠察员有铁棒……”"
"Feet swayed about me, and some hobnailed miner kicked my ankle and went stumbling.","无数双脚从我周围踏过，有几个穿着平头钉靴的工人踢到了我的脚踝，被绊倒了。"
"There were shouts and curses, and then everything had swept past me.","呼喊与咒骂声接踵而至，然后一切都离我远去。"
"I rolled over on my face and beheld the chauffeur, young Verrall, and Lord Redcar—the latter holding up his long skirts of fur, and making a grotesque figure—one behind the other, in full bolt across a coldly comet-lit interval, towards the open gates of the colliery.","我从地上翻过身来，看到司机、小维罗尔和雷德卡勋爵——雷德卡勋爵拖着他的皮长衫——一个跟着一个地仓皇逃走，他们穿过冰冷的彗星光芒照亮的空隙，跑向大敞的煤矿大门　。"
"I raised myself up on my hands.","我双手撑起身体。"
"Young Verrall!","小维罗尔！"
"I had not even drawn my revolver—I had forgotten it.","我还没来得及开枪呢，我忘了开枪。"
"I was covered with coaly mud—knees, elbows, shoulders, back.","我身上到处都是煤灰——膝盖上，胳膊肘上，肩膀上，后背上。"
"I had not even drawn my revolver!..","可我竟然忘了开枪！"
"A feeling of ridiculous impotence overwhelmed me.","一种滑稽而无奈的感觉涌上了我的心头。"
"I struggled painfully to my feet.","我痛苦地挣扎着站了起来。"
"I hesitated for a moment towards the gates of the colliery, and then went limping homeward, thwarted, painful, confused, and ashamed.","我面向着煤矿大门迟疑了一下，而后便一瘸一拐地走向了家，心里充满了挫败感，痛苦不堪，糊里糊涂而又无比羞愧。"
"I had not the heart nor desire to help in the wrecking and burning of Lord Redcar’s motor.","我没心情、也不想去帮忙破坏或是烧掉雷德卡勋爵的车。"
"Section 4","第四节"
"In the night, fever, pain, fatigue—it may be the indigestion of my supper of bread and cheese—roused me at last out of a hag-rid sleep to face despair.","夜里，发烧、疼痛、疲惫，抑或是晚饭吃的面包和乳酪引起的消化不良折磨着我，最后让我从噩梦中醒来，面对现实的绝望。"
"I was a soul lost amidst desolations and shame, dishonored, evilly treated, hopeless.","我的灵魂在颓废、羞耻、屈辱、虐待和绝望中迷失。"
"I raged against the God I denied, and cursed him as I lay.","我躺在床上冲着我认为不存在的上帝大发雷霆，大肆诅咒他。"
"And it was in the nature of my fever, which was indeed only half fatigue and illness, and the rest the disorder of passionate youth, that Nettie, a strangely distorted Nettie, should come through the brief dreams that marked the exhaustions of that vigil, to dominate my misery.","只有在发烧中（发烧的一半原因确实是由于疲劳和病痛造成的，其余的则是因为失调的青春激情，因为妮蒂——那个反常变形的妮蒂），才有可能让我经历短暂、标志着放下戒备的梦境，这梦境主宰了我的痛苦。"
"I was sensible, with an exaggerated distinctness, of the intensity of her physical charm for me, of her every grace and beauty; she took to herself the whole gamut of desire in me and the whole gamut of pride.","我是比较敏感的，我对于她对我产生的肉体上的浓烈的魅力以及她的优雅和美丽都有着非同一般清醒的认识。而她却将自己视为我的全部欲望和骄傲。"
"She, bodily, was my lost honor.","她，从肉体上讲，是我失去的荣耀。"
"It was not only loss but disgrace to lose her.","失去她不仅仅是面子上的问题，还是一种羞耻。"
"She stood for life and all that was denied; she mocked me as a creature of failure and defeat.","她象征着生活，象征被拒绝的一切。她对我的嘲弄就像对一只失意的、失败了的动物的嘲弄。"
"My spirit raised itself towards her, and then the bruise upon my jaw glowed with a dull heat, and I rolled in the mud again before my rivals.","我一想起她情绪就上来了，而我下巴上的淤青却因发热而涨红，于是我当着情敌的面又滚到了泥里。"
"There were times when something near madness took me, and I gnashed my teeth and dug my nails into my hands and ceased to curse and cry out only by reason of the insufficiency of words.","有一段时间，身边一有什么疯狂的事情吸引了我，我就咬紧牙关，用指甲掐一下自己的手，只有词穷才会停止咒骂而大吼一声。"
"And once towards dawn I got out of bed, and sat by my looking-glass with my revolver loaded in my hand.","黎明一来临，我便起身，手里握着上了膛的左轮手枪坐在穿衣镜旁边。"
"I stood up at last and put it carefully in my drawer and locked it—out of reach of any gusty impulse.","最后我站起身来，把手枪小心翼翼地放进抽屉里锁起来，以防自己冲动起来的时候再次拿起枪。"
"After that I slept for a little while.","随后我睡了一小会儿。"
"Such nights were nothing rare and strange in that old order of the world.","在那时的社会秩序下，这种夜晚没什么可稀奇的。"
"Never a city, never a night the whole year round, but amidst those who slept were those who waked, plumbing the deeps of wrath and misery.","整整一年，只有那些失眠的人才能体会到任何城市、任何夜晚都无法了解的愤怒和痛苦。"
"Countless thousands there were so ill, so troubled, they agonize near to the very border-line of madness, each one the center of a universe darkened and lost...","无数的人身患恶疾、身心烦闷、在疯狂的边缘痛苦地挣扎着，世界上每一个中心地带都处于暗无天日的迷失状态中。"
"The next day I spent in gloomy lethargy.","我在阴郁和冷漠中浑浑噩噩地度过了第二天。"
"I had intended to go to Checkshill that day, but my bruised ankle was too swollen for that to be possible.","那天我原本是要去切克希利的，但是我受伤的踝关节肿胀不已，根本走不了路。"
"I sat indoors in the ill-lit downstairs kitchen, with my foot bandaged, and mused darkly and read.","我呆在家里，坐在楼下昏暗的厨房里，脚上缠着绷带，苦苦思索着，默默读着书。"
"My dear old mother waited on me, and her brown eyes watched me and wondered at my black silences, my frowning preoccupations.","我亲爱的老母亲照顾着我，用她棕色的眼睛凝望着我，不明白我为何会如此沉默阴郁，为何会眉头紧皱，如此全神贯注地思索。"
"I had not told her how it was my ankle came to be bruised and my clothes muddy.","我还没有告诉她我的脚踝为何会淤青，为何我衣服上沾满了泥土。"
"She had brushed my clothes in the morning before I got up.","在我还没起床的时候，她就已经把我的衣服洗干净了。"
"Ah well!","天哪！"
"Mothers are not treated in that way now.","现在的母亲们怎么会受到这样的待遇。"
"That I suppose must console me.","我想这一定是对我的安慰。"
"I wonder how far you will be able to picture that dark, grimy, untidy room, with its bare deal table, its tattered wall paper, the saucepans and kettle on the narrow, cheap, but by no means economical range, the ashes under the fireplace, the rust-spotted steel fender on which my bandaged feet rested; I wonder how near you can come to seeing the scowling pale-faced hobbledehoy I was, unshaven and collarless, in the Windsor chair, and the little timid, dirty, devoted old woman who hovered about me with love peering out from her puckered eyelids...","我不知你们是否能想象得到，在那间昏暗、肮脏、凌乱的小屋里，摆着破烂不堪的松木饭桌，墙纸已经烂得像碎片一样，狭小而廉价却一点儿也不经济的炉灶上放着平底锅和水壶，壁炉灰烬成堆，铁围栏上锈迹斑斑，我缠着绷带的脚就放在围栏上。我不知道你们是否能走近一些，看看我满面愁容、面色苍白、行动笨拙、胡子拉碴、没穿硬领坐在一张温莎椅上的样子。而我旁边那位有些胆怯、声音沙哑的慈祥的老妇人则怀着爱围着我忙这忙那，皱着眉头凝望着我……"
"When she went out to buy some vegetables in the middle of the morning she got me a half-penny journal.","临近中午的时候，她出去买了些蔬菜，顺便给我带来一份半便士的报纸。"
"It was just such a one as these upon my desk, only that the copy I read was damp from the press, and these are so dry and brittle, they crack if I touch them.","就是堆在我书桌上的那种，不同的是这份报纸的油墨还没干呢，而桌上那堆已经干得发脆了，一碰就发出沙沙的声响。"
"I have a copy of the actual issue I read that morning; it was a paper called emphatically the New Paper, but everybody bought it and everybody called it the “yell.”","那天我看到的报道中有一份真实描述了所发生的事件。报纸名字是《新报》，不过每一个买来读的人都习惯称它为《呐喊》。"
"It was full that morning of stupendous news and still more stupendous headlines, so stupendous that for a little while I was roused from my egotistical broodings to wider interests.","那天的报纸上随处可见骇人听闻的新闻，还有更为夸张的通栏大标题。这些令人震惊的消息提起了我更广泛的兴趣，让我不再只沉浸在自己的阴郁中。"
"For it seemed that Germany and England were on the brink of war.","因为有报道显示，似乎德国和英国即将开战了。"
"Of all the monstrous irrational phenomena of the former time, war was certainly the most strikingly insane.","在前面所发生的所有的诡异而荒诞不经的事情中，战争无疑是最疯狂的一件事了。"
"In reality it was probably far less mischievous than such quieter evil as, for example, the general acquiescence in the private ownership of land, but its evil consequences showed so plainly that even in those days of stifling confusion one marveled at it.","而事实上，战争的害处远比一些隐蔽的罪恶小得多，比如，普遍默许土地私有制的存在。但是战争的罪恶结果清晰地表明，即使在那种令人窒息的混乱状态中，战争也会引起人们的无限惊恐。"
"On no conceivable grounds was there any sense in modern war.","没有任何站得住脚的理由可以用来支持现代战争。"
"Save for the slaughter and mangling of a multitude of people, the destruction of vast quantities of material, and the waste of innumerable units of energy, it effected nothing.","战争带来的是人与人之间的残杀、大量物质的毁灭以及无数能量的浪费，除此之外，别无他物。"
"The old war of savage and barbaric nations did at least change humanity, you assumed yourselves to be a superior tribe in physique and discipline, you demonstrated this upon your neighbors, and if successful you took their land and their women and perpetuated and enlarged your superiority.","过去，野蛮人和野蛮人之间的战争至少还能促进人类的改良。如果你们觉得自己体魄健壮、训练有素，你就可以与邻邦干上一仗。打了胜仗，便可以占有他们的土地和女人，让自己的这种优越感更持久更膨胀。"
"The new war changed nothing but the color of maps, the design of postage stamps, and the relationship of a few accidentally conspicuous individuals.","而新时代的战争除了能改变地图的颜色、邮票的设计和一些偶然引起人们注意的个人之间的关系之外，其他什么都改变不了。"
"In one of the last of these international epileptic fits, for example, the English, with much dysentery and bad poetry, and a few hundred deaths in battle, conquered the South African Boers at a gross cost of about three thousand pounds per head—they could have bought the whole of that preposterous imitation of a nation for a tenth of that sum—and except for a few substitutions of personalities, this group of partially corrupt officials in the place of that, and so forth, the permanent change was altogether insignificant.","比如说，在最近一次世界的间歇爆发中，英国人——以痢疾和拙劣的诗著名的英国人——征服了南非的布尔，有几百人战死沙场，每个人的死亡抚恤金为3000英镑。但他们本可以用十分之一的代价买下这个地方。那地方只有一些人物的代替品和尚未彻底腐败的官员之类的，总体上讲，永久性的改变根本不足挂齿。"
"(But an excitable young man in Austria committed suicide when at length the Transvaal ceased to be a “nation.”) Men went through the seat of that war after it was all over, and found humanity unchanged, except for a general impoverishment, and the convenience of an unlimited supply of empty ration tins and barbed wire and cartridge cases—unchanged and resuming with a slight perplexity all its old habits and misunderstandings, the nigger still in his slum-like kraal, the white in his ugly ill-managed shanty...","（也有特例，当南非的阿扎尼亚一个省份德兰士不再是一个“部落”时，奥地利一名容易冲动的小伙子自杀身亡了。）战争结束后，走过战争发生地的人们发现人性并没有什么改变，除了普遍存在的贫穷问题之外，依然有无限提供的空食物桶，装有倒钩的钓鱼线和弹药盒，这一切都没有变，只是多了些困惑。所有的陈规陋习和人与人之间的误解卷土重来，黑人们依然住在如同贫民窟一样的村落，而白人们依然在简陋混乱的棚屋里栖身。"
"But we in England saw all these things, or did not see them, through the mirage of the New Paper, in a light of mania.","可在英格兰我们就看到了这一切，或是在《新报》所展示的海市蜃楼中，对这一切熟视无睹，仅仅将此看作是一种狂躁症。"
"All my adolescence from fourteen to seventeen went to the music of that monstrous resonating futility, the cheering, the anxieties, the songs and the waving of flags, the wrongs of generous Buller and the glorious heroism of De Wet—who ALWAYS got away; that was the great point about the heroic De Wet—and it never occurred to us that the total population we fought against was less than half the number of those who lived cramped ignoble lives within the compass of the Four Towns.","从14岁到17岁，我的青春期里充斥着有巨大回声的音乐、欢呼声、渴望、歌声、在风中飘扬着的红旗以及大方的布勒和张扬跋扈的英雄主义者德韦特——他经常干了坏事就推卸责任——这就是我们的英雄般的德韦特的伟大之处。我们所抗争的人的数量还不到挤在四镇过着卑贱生活的人数的一半。"
"But before and after that stupid conflict of stupidities, a greater antagonism was coming into being, was slowly and quietly defining itself as a thing inevitable, sinking now a little out of attention only to resume more emphatically, now flashing into some acute definitive expression and now percolating and pervading some new region of thought, and that was the antagonism of Germany and Great Britain.","而在乏味和愚蠢和倾轧斗争的前后，正在出现一种更为宏大的对抗。它缓慢而平静，成为无法避免的事实，偶尔淡出人们的视线，而目的只为了更加明显地引起关注，这种对抗现已表现得强烈而明确，并渗透而弥漫着另一种观念，那就是德国和大英帝国之间的对抗。"
"When I think of that growing proportion of readers who belong entirely to the new order, who are growing up with only the vaguest early memories of the old world, I find the greatest difficulty in writing down the unintelligible confusions that were matter of fact to their fathers.","每当我想到越来越多的读者都完全属于新的秩序，他们对曾经旧日的世界仅有极为模糊的早期记忆，我就会发觉记录那些本属于他们父辈的晦涩而混乱的事情，是十分困难的。"
"Here were we British, forty-one millions of people, in a state of almost indescribably aimless, economic, and moral muddle that we had neither the courage, the energy, nor the intelligence to improve, that most of us had hardly the courage to think about, and with our affairs hopelessly entangled with the entirely different confusions of three hundred and fifty million other persons scattered about the globe, and here were the Germans over against us, fifty-six millions, in a state of confusion no whit better than our own, and the noisy little creatures who directed papers and wrote books and gave lectures, and generally in that time of world-dementia pretended to be the national mind, were busy in both countries, with a sort of infernal unanimity, exhorting—and not only exhorting but successfully persuading—the two peoples to divert such small common store of material, moral and intellectual energy as either possessed, into the purely destructive and wasteful business of war.","当时英国有四千一百万人口，几乎都处于一种不可描述的状态，漫无目的、混乱、道德沦丧，我们既没有勇气和精力，没有足够的才智去改善这种状态，大多数人甚至都不敢去考虑这个问题。同时，我们的事情跟世界上其他的三亿五千万人完全不同的混乱不可救药地纠缠在一起。那时德国人有五千六百万人跟我们作对，也处于混乱状态，也不比我们好。喧嚣的小人物们编排报纸、出书、发表演讲，这些人在那全球迟钝的时代常将自己标榜成民族的精神。两个国家的这种人都在忙碌奔走着，带着可恶的默契，让两国人民将自己每一份普通的智力和道德的能量都放到纯粹是破坏性的、消耗性的战争中去，他们不仅仅是规劝，而且是成功说服了大家。"
"And—I have to tell you these things even if you do not believe them, because they are vital to my story—there was not a man alive who could have told you of any real permanent benefit, of anything whatever to counterbalance the obvious waste and evil, that would result from a war between England and Germany, whether England shattered Germany or was smashed and overwhelmed, or whatever the end might be.","即使你们不相信，我也不得不说，因为这对我的故事来说是十分重要的，并且也没有一个活着的人能够告诉你任何真正持久的利益，告诉你什么可以抵消明显的浪费和罪恶。这些罪恶都是出自英德两国之间的战争，无论是英国铲平德国，还是德国铲平、征服英国，也无所谓是什么结果。"
"The thing was, in fact, an enormous irrational obsession, it was, in the microcosm of our nation, curiously parallel to the egotistical wrath and jealousy that swayed my individual microcosm.","这其实是一件极其不理智且难以摆脱的事情，在我们民族的微观世界里，它与支配我自己的微观世界中的傲慢的愤怒与嫉妒极为相似。"
"It measured the excess of common emotion over the common intelligence, the legacy of inordinate passion we have received from the brute from which we came.","它衡量出的普通感情超过了普通的理智，超越了我们所遗传的过度的激情——那是一种与生俱来的野性。"
"Just as I had become the slave of my own surprise and anger and went hither and thither with a loaded revolver, seeking and intending vague fluctuating crimes, so these two nations went about the earth, hot eared and muddle headed, with loaded navies and armies terribly ready at hand.","正如我曾经变成自己的惊诧与愤怒的奴隶一样，我曾握着子弹上膛的左轮手枪到处晃荡，伺机犯下模糊而动荡的罪行，所以说，这两个民族就在地球周边徘徊，头脑发热，海军舰队和陆军舰队全副武装，整装待发。"
"Only there was not even a Nettie to justify their stupidity.","只是，它们之间的愚蠢战争甚至没有一个像妮蒂一样诸如此类的理由。"
"There was nothing but quiet imaginary thwarting on either side.","仅仅为了莫名其妙的虚幻猜测，他们双方就剑拔弩张了。"
"And the press was the chief instrument that kept these two huge multitudes of people directed against one another.","而新闻舆论便是这两队庞大的人群将矛头指向彼此并处于敌对状态的主要工具。"
"The press—those newspapers that are now so strange to us—like the “Empires,” the “Nations,” the Trusts, and all the other great monstrous shapes of that extraordinary time—was in the nature of an unanticipated accident.","那些报纸，什么《帝国》、《民族》，还有托拉斯什么的，如今对我们来说已经是十分陌生的了，还有那个特殊时期里出来的其他奇怪的东西，尽管那些东西有很大的偶然性，但也都出乎预料地出现在了那个世界。"
"It had happened, as weeds happen in abandoned gardens, just as all our world has happened,—because there was no clear Will in the world to bring about anything better.","而事情已经发生了，就像荒芜的园林中长出野草一样，全世界都是这样，因为世界上就不存在让一切更好这样的明确的目的。"
"Towards the end this “press” was almost entirely under the direction of youngish men of that eager, rather unintelligent type, that is never able to detect itself aimless, that pursues nothing with incredible pride and zeal, and if you would really understand this mad era the comet brought to an end, you must keep in mind that every phase in the production of these queer old things was pervaded by a strong aimless energy and happened in a concentrated rush.","后来，舆论几乎完全被那些蠢蠢欲动、傻里傻气的年轻男人掌控了。这些人从未意识到自己只是一群没有目标的没头苍蝇，他们充满着不可思议的热情和自豪感。如果你想真正理解彗星事件之前那个疯狂时代是个什么样子，你绝不能忽视一点，那就是，在每个时期，我所描述的种种怪事背后都存在一种盲目但强大的推动力。"
"Let me describe to you, very briefly, a newspaper day.","接下来就让我向你们大致描述一下一张报纸是如何产生的。"
"Figure first, then, a hastily erected and still more hastily designed building in a dirty, paper-littered back street of old London, and a number of shabbily dressed men coming and going in this with projectile swiftness, and within this factory companies of printers, tensely active with nimble fingers—they were always speeding up the printers—ply their type-setting machines, and cast and arrange masses of metal in a sort of kitchen inferno, above which, in a beehive of little brightly lit rooms, disheveled men sit and scribble.","首先，想象一下这个画面，一栋在匆忙中建起、设计更为草率的楼，矗立在伦敦老城区的一条肮脏的、遍地纸屑的偏僻街道上，街上的路人川流不息，衣衫褴褛。在这个由印刷工人组成的工厂群里，灵巧的手指紧张地工作着——他们总爱催促印刷工人赶进度——在炼狱般的工作间里，印刷工人开动着排字机器，铸造着大量的金属字，之后再将这些字排成字形，排字间上面是一些蜂房一般的通明的房间，里面的人衣装不整，忙着乱涂乱抹。"
"There is a throbbing of telephones and a clicking of telegraph needles, a rushing of messengers, a running to and fro of heated men, clutching proofs and copy.","一台电话正在响着铃声，电报机滴答作响，通信员不停地跑进跑出，激动的人来回奔跑，手里抓着校对稿和排字复印稿。"
"Then begins a clatter roar of machinery catching the infection, going faster and faster, and whizzing and banging,—engineers, who have never had time to wash since their birth, flying about with oil-cans, while paper runs off its rolls with a shudder of haste.","紧接着，机器轰鸣，越转越快，不停地刷刷作响，从出生就没时间洗脸的工程师们拎着油桶疾步如飞，报纸则快速地滚出滚筒。"
"The proprietor you must suppose arriving explosively on a swift motor-car, leaping out before the thing is at a standstill, with letters and documents clutched in his hand, rushing in, resolute to “hustle,” getting wonderfully in everybody’s way.","你一定能够想到，业主脾气暴躁，乘车疾驰而来，车还没停稳就急着跳下来，握着信和文件冲进车间，决心自己要在这里“不断穿行”，结果挡住了所有人的路。"
"At the sight of him even the messenger boys who are waiting, get up and scamper to and fro.","一看到他进来，一旁等待的小通讯员都赶紧起身来回奔波。"
"Sprinkle your vision with collisions, curses, incoherencies.","请你想象那种冲突、咒骂和无序的情景。"
"You imagine all the parts of this complex lunatic machine working hysterically toward a crescendo of haste and excitement as the night wears on.","你可以想到，这台复杂而疯狂的机器上的所有零件都在疯狂地运作，夜色渐渐临近，紧张和激动的高潮也随之到来。"
"At last the only things that seem to travel slowly in all those tearing vibrating premises are the hands of the clock.","最终，在这些激烈的工作中，在这个令人激动的工作间里，似乎唯一能够慢慢移动的东西就是钟表的指针了。"
"Slowly things draw on toward publication, the consummation of all those stresses.","报纸渐渐接近出版阶段，这些压力也渐渐趋于解除状态。"
"Then in the small hours, into the now dark and deserted streets comes a wild whirl of carts and men, the place spurts paper at every door, bales, heaps, torrents of papers, that are snatched and flung about in what looks like a free fight, and off with a rush and clatter east, west, north, and south.","而后，凌晨时，当时天还很黑，街上不见一个人影。突然，人和车辆一涌而出。一霎时，成包成捆的报纸朝每一家门前扔去。报纸被四下乱扔，看上去就像是一场乱战。然后，这些车和人又朝各个方向绝尘而去。"
"The interest passes outwardly; the men from the little rooms are going homeward, the printers disperse yawning, the roaring presses slacken.","重心转到外围工作上去了，所以工人们走出工作间，准备回家。印刷工打着呵欠四散而去，轰鸣声渐渐平息。"
"The paper exists.","一张报纸就这样产生了。"
"Distribution follows manufacture, and we follow the bundles.","印刷后便发行，我们则竞相阅读报纸。"
"Our vision becomes a vision of dispersal.","我们的视野就这样被报纸限制了。"
"You see those bundles hurling into stations, catching trains by a hair’s breadth, speeding on their way, breaking up, smaller bundles of them hurled with a fierce accuracy out upon the platforms that rush by, and then everywhere a division of these smaller bundles into still smaller bundles, into dispersing parcels, into separate papers, and the dawn happens unnoticed amidst a great running and shouting of boys, a shoving through letter slots, openings of windows, spreading out upon book-stalls.","这样你就明白了吧，这些报纸被扔进火车站，甚至差点儿赶不上火车。它们在火车上上路、加速，然后再被分成小捆，再被用力准确地抛出火车，摔到站台上，火车疾驰而过，而在每个地方，这些小捆则又被分成更小的捆，分装进一些包裹，或是成为分好的报纸。不知不觉中，天已经亮了，晨光中的报童们叫卖着跑来跑去，将报纸塞进信箱缝里，或者打开窗户，将报纸分放在书摊上。"
"For the space of a few hours you must figure the whole country dotted white with rustling papers—placards everywhere vociferating the hurried lie for the day; men and women in trains, men and women eating and reading, men by study-fenders, people sitting up in bed, mothers and sons and daughters waiting for father to finish—a million scattered people reading—reading headlong—or feverishly ready to read.","你一定能想象得到，短短几个小时，整个国家因为到处都是报纸而到处布满了白色——随处可见的张贴版上宣扬着当天匆忙编出的谎言，乘火车的人们边吃饭边读着报纸。男人总靠在书房的沙发上，人们早上起来，母亲和孩子们都要先等待父亲快点儿把报纸读完——有一百万人在世界各处阅读着报纸，有的轻松随意，有的极度热切。"
"It is just as if some vehement jet had sprayed that white foam of papers over the surface of the land...","这就像一阵猛烈的喷射，将报纸的白色泡沫把大地表面喷遍……"
"And then you know, wonderfully gone—gone utterly, vanished as foam might vanish upon the sand.","然后，你明白的，这些泡沫都奇迹般地不见了，连一丝痕迹都没留下，像泡沫完全消失在沙子中一样。"
"Nonsense!","荒谬！"
"The whole affair a noisy paroxysm of nonsense, unreasonable excitement, witless mischief, and waste of strength—signifying nothing....","这事儿从头到尾就是一阵喧嚣的突然发作，不理智的兴奋、激动，丧失理智的闹剧，完全就是浪费精力——没有任何意义……"
"And one of those white parcels was the paper I held in my hands, as I sat with a bandaged foot on the steel fender in that dark underground kitchen of my mother’s, clean roused from my personal troubles by the yelp of the headlines.","我手中就是这样一份白色的报纸，我把缠着绷带的脚放在母亲昏暗地下室的厨房里的铁栏杆上，报纸上大字标题的呐喊让我从个人琐事中彻底清醒了。"
"She sat, sleeves tucked up from her ropy arms, peeling potatoes as I read.","我的母亲就坐在那里，胳膊结实，袖子卷起，在我读报的时候，削着土豆。"
"It was like one of a flood of disease germs that have invaded a body, that paper.","那份报纸就像是一团病菌一样，能够侵入人的身体。"
"There I was, one corpuscle in the big amorphous body of the English community, one of forty-one million such corpuscles and, for all my preoccupations, these potent headlines, this paper ferment, caught me and swung me about.","而我就是英国社会这大机体中乱七八糟的小细胞中的一个，是四千一百万小细胞中的一分子，这些大标题对满是成见的我来说很有说服力，那煽动的信息强烈地吸引力我，在我心头挥之不去。"
"And all over the country that day, millions read as I read, and came round into line with me, under the same magnetic spell, came round—how did we say it?—Ah!—“to face the foe.”","那一天，全国有几百万人和我一样读了这份报纸，与我一样感同身受，被同样的咒语吸引着，改了主意。该怎么说来着，哦——“直面敌人”。"
"The comet had been driven into obscurity overleaf.","彗星被印在人们很难注意的背面。"
"The column headed “Distinguished Scientist says Comet will Strike our Earth.","标题栏上写着“著名科学家称彗星将撞击地球”。"
"Does it Matter?”","这有什么重要的？"
"went unread.","于是没人读。"
"“Germany”—I usually figured this mythical malignant creature as a corseted stiff-mustached Emperor enhanced by heraldic black wings and a large sword—had insulted our flag.","“德国”——我常把这个虚构的、邪恶的国度想成一位头戴盔甲、胡须坚硬的皇帝，他长着一对佩戴着勋章的黑翅膀，手持一柄长刀，威风凛凛，侮辱着我们的国旗。"
"That was the message of the New Paper, and the monster towered over me, threatening fresh outrages, visibly spitting upon my faultless country’s colors.","这些就是《新报》上面发布的信息，这个怪物压制着我，变本加厉地恐吓着民众，明目张胆地蔑视着我们国家那无瑕的国旗色彩。"
"Somebody had hoisted a British flag on the right bank of some tropical river I had never heard of before, and a drunken German officer under ambiguous instructions had torn it down.","曾有人在一条我从未听说过的热带河流的右岸竖起一面英国国旗，而一名醉醺醺的德国军官在一条不清不楚的指示下，将它扯了下来。"
"Then one of the convenient abundant natives of the country, a British subject indisputably, had been shot in the leg.","紧接着，当地的一名富人，毫无疑问，是一名是英国人，被人打中了腿部。"
"But the facts were by no means clear.","但事实却始终不清不楚。"
"Nothing was clear except that we were not going to stand any nonsense from Germany.","我们没能搞清楚什么，但有一点可以确定，那就是我们绝不会接受来自德国方面的任何胡言乱语。"
"Whatever had or had not happened we meant to have an apology for, and apparently they did not mean apologizing.","无论发生了什么或是没发生什么，我们都表示歉意，而显然他们却无意于此。"
"“HAS War COME AT LAST?”","“战争终于还是来了吗？”"
"That was the headline.","这就是标题。"
"One’s heart leapt to assent....","人们心潮澎湃，趋之若鹜……"
"There were hours that day when I clean forgot Nettie, in dreaming of battles and victories by land and sea, of shell fire, and entrenchments, and the heaped slaughter of many thousands of men.","那天，我一度彻底忘记了妮蒂，沉浸在海陆战斗和胜利的臆想中，满脑子都是炮火、战壕以及千军万马浴血厮杀的场面。"
"But the next morning I started for Checkshill, started, I remember, in a curiously hopeful state of mind, oblivious of comets, strikes, and wars.","然而，第二天清晨，当我动身去切克希利的时候，我却在一种新奇而充满希望的状态中，不经意地想起了彗星、罢工以及战争。"
"Section 5","第五节"
"You must understand that I had no set plan of murder when I walked over to Checkshill.","你要明白，在我在去切克希利的时候，我从未想过要去谋杀谁。"
"I had no set plan of any sort.","我什么计划都没有。"
"There was a great confusion of dramatically conceived intentions in my head, scenes of threatening and denunciation and terror, but I did not mean to kill.","我脑海中仅有一堆凌乱的戏剧性的想法，有一些威胁、谴责以及恐吓的场景，但我从没想过要去杀人。"
"The revolver was to turn upon my rival my disadvantage in age and physique....","左轮手枪是用来对付我的对手的，但年龄和体魄成了我的不利条件。"
"But that was not it really!","但那是真枪实弹啊！"
"The revolver!—I took the revolver because I had the revolver and was a foolish young lout.","左轮手枪！——我随身带了把左轮手枪，因为我有枪，而且我年轻气盛，愚不可及。"
"It was a dramatic sort of thing to take.","这事儿说来也挺戏剧化的。"
"I had, I say, no plan at all.","我说过了，我之前什么计划都没有。"
"Ever and again during that second trudge to Checkshill I was irradiated with a novel unreasonable hope.","在第二次去切克希利的那段艰难的旅途中，我总是受到一个新鲜却不合情理的希望的启发。"
"I had awakened in the morning with the hope, it may have been the last unfaded trail of some obliterated dream, that after all Nettie might relent toward me, that her heart was kind toward me in spite of all that I imagined had happened.","清晨，我怀着这个希望醒来，或许它本身就是一些被遗忘的梦境的残存痕迹。尽管我想象的都已经发生了，但妮蒂也许会同情我，会对我好一点儿。"
"I even thought it possible that I might have misinterpreted what I had seen.","我甚至觉得有可能是我曲解了我所看到的一切。"
"Perhaps she would explain everything.","或许她能将这一切都解释清楚。"
"My revolver was in my pocket for all that.","我的手枪就放在口袋里，我已经做好了一切准备。"
"I limped at the outset, but after the second mile my ankle warmed to forgetfulness, and the rest of the way I walked well.","起初，我是一瘸一拐慢慢走着的，但当走过了两英里后，我的踝部开始发热，也就忘记了疼痛，因而余下的路程我走得很顺利。"
"Suppose, after all, I was wrong?","我想，我是不是真的错了？"
"I was still debating that, as I came through the park.","我穿过公园的时候，心里还在纠缠着这个问题。"
"By the corner of the paddock near the keeper’s cottage, I was reminded by some belated blue hyacinths of a time when I and Nettie had gathered them together.","当我经过公园管理员住的小屋，看到附近围场的角落里那些绽放如初蓝色风信子，那些和妮蒂一起摘风信子的时光不禁涌上心头。"
"It seemed impossible that we could really have parted ourselves for good and all.","似乎我们永远都不可能真的分手的。"
"A wave of tenderness flowed over me, and still flooded me as I came through the little dell and drew towards the hollies.","当我穿过小山谷，走向冬青丛的时候，我心中突然泛起一阵柔波，像潮水般淹没了我。"
"But there the sweet Nettie of my boy’s love faded, and I thought of the new Nettie of desire and the man I had come upon in the moonlight, I thought of the narrow, hot purpose that had grown so strongly out of my springtime freshness, and my mood darkened to night.","但我对妮蒂的那份少年的爱意却渐渐退去了，我想到我想要的妮蒂的新形象，想到了我在月色中看到的那个男子，想到了我褪去少年时的青涩，那一狭隘而热切的目的随之发芽，我的心也跟着沉重起来。"
"I crossed the beech wood and came towards the gardens with a resolute and sorrowful heart.","我穿过山毛榉树林走向花园，心中满是坚定和遗憾。"
"When I reached the green door in the garden wall I was seized for a space with so violent a trembling that I could not grip the latch to lift it, for I no longer had any doubt how this would end.","当我走到花园围墙旁那扇绿色的门前时，我一时间颤抖起来，颤抖地抓不住门闩、打不开门，因为我知道，这就是我和妮蒂之间的结局了。"
"That trembling was succeeded by a feeling of cold, and whiteness, and self-pity.","我终于不再颤抖，渐渐冷静下来，变得纯粹而自怜。"
"I was astonished to find myself grimacing, to feel my cheeks wet, and thereupon I gave way completely to a wild passion of weeping.","我惊讶于自己的满面愁容，感到脸颊上有泪滑过，终于，我再也控制不住自己的情绪，放声哭泣起来。"
"I must take just a little time before the thing was done....","我必须在事情彻底结束之前用一些时间……"
"I turned away from the door and stumbled for a little distance, sobbing loudly, and lay down out of sight among the bracken, and so presently became calm again.","我转身离开了大门，跌跌撞撞地走出一小段距离，便放声抽泣，然后躺在无人注意的欧洲蕨中，再次恢复了平静。"
"I lay there some time.","我在那儿躺了一段时间。"
"I had half a mind to desist, and then my emotion passed like the shadow of a cloud, and I walked very coolly into the gardens.","在差不多要放弃的时候，我的情绪如同云的阴影般又涌上心头，于是我平静地走进了花园。"
"Through the open door of one of the glass houses I saw old Stuart.","我穿过一间玻璃暖房大敞的门，看见了老斯图尔特。"
"He was leaning against the staging, his hands in his pockets, and so deep in thought he gave no heed to me.","他靠着架子，手插在衣袋里，正在想着什么，完全没有意识到我的到来。"
"I hesitated and went on towards the cottage, slowly.","我犹豫了一下，继而缓缓走向房间。"
"Something struck me as unusual about the place, but I could not tell at first what it was.","我注意到里面的气氛有些反常，但一时间又说不定到底哪里不对劲。"
"One of the bedroom windows was open, and the customary short blind, with its brass upper rail partly unfastened, drooped obliquely across the vacant space.","卧室的一扇窗大敞着，而这儿通常都是低垂着百叶窗的，上半部的横档半开，斜着垂下来吊在半空中。"
"It looked negligent and odd, for usually everything about the cottage was conspicuously trim.","一切看起来都漫不经心却又有些奇怪，因为通常这里的一切都是整齐有序的。"
"The door was standing wide open, and everything was still.","门大敞着，房间里还都是老样子。"
"But giving that usually orderly hall an odd look—it was about half-past two in the afternoon—was a pile of three dirty plates, with used knives and forks upon them, on one of the hall chairs.","但平时整洁的门厅却有一种奇怪的样子。那时差不多是下午两点半，三个脏兮兮的盘子叠在一起，上面放着用过的刀叉，堆在一张椅子上。"
"I went into the hall, looked into either room, and hesitated.","我走进门厅，向两边的房间看了看，犹豫着要不要进去。"
"Then I fell to upon the door-knocker and gave a loud rat-tat-too, and followed this up with an amiable “Hel-lo!”","然后我敲着门环，发出响亮的啪啪声，紧接着又亲切地“喂”了一声。"
"For a time no one answered me, and I stood listening and expectant, with my fingers about my weapon.","一时间没人应门，我停下来仔细听着，等待着回答，手却抓着口袋里的枪。"
"Some one moved about upstairs presently, and was still again.","这时我听到有人走上楼来，可不久又没了动静。"
"The tension of waiting seemed to brace my nerves.","这等待时刻的紧张情绪紧紧绷着我的神经。"
"I had my hand on the knocker for the second time, when Puss appeared in the doorway.","我又一次抓住门环，正要敲的时候，看到普斯站在门口。"
"For a moment we remained staring at one another without speaking.","一时间我们陷入了沉默，只是默默地望着彼此。"
"Her hair was disheveled, her face dirty, tear-stained, and irregularly red.","她蓬头垢面，满是泪痕的脸异样的红。"
"Her expression at the sight of me was pure astonishment.","她见到我，眼中只是惊讶。"
"I thought she was about to say something, and then she had darted away out of the house again.","我以为她就要跟我说些什么了，可她却又忽然跑出了房间。"
"“I say, Puss!”","“等等，普斯！”"
"I said.","我说，"
"“Puss!”","“普斯！”"
"I followed her out of the door.","我跟着她跑出了房间门。"
"“Puss!","“普斯！"
"What’s the matter?","发生什么事了？”"
"Where’s Nettie?”","妮蒂呢？”"
"She vanished round the corner of the house.","她消失在房间的角落里。"
"I hesitated, perplexed whether I should pursue her.","我踌躇着，不知要不要追她过去。"
"What did it all mean?","这一切意味着什么？"
"Then I heard some one upstairs.","接着我听到楼上有声音传来。"
"“Willie!”","“威利！”"
"cried the voice of Mrs. Stuart.","是斯图尔特夫人在喊道，"
"“Is that you?”","“是你吗？”"
"“Yes,” I answered.","“是我。”我回答说，"
"“Where’s every one?","“大家都在哪儿啊？"
"Where’s Nettie?","妮蒂呢？"
"I want to have a talk with her.”","我想给跟她谈谈。”"
"She did not answer, but I heard her dress rustle as she moved.","她没有回应，但我听得到她走路时衣服沙沙的响声。"
"I Judged she was upon the landing overhead.","我想她正在头顶的楼梯平台上。"
"I paused at the foot of the stairs, expecting her to appear and come down.","我在楼梯边停下来，等待她的出现，等她走下来。"
"Suddenly came a strange sound, a rush of sounds, words jumbled and hurrying, confused and shapeless, borne along upon a note of throaty distress that at last submerged the words altogether and ended in a wail.","一个奇怪的声音突然传来，语速很快，吐字不清，听上去混乱又没什么逻辑，还带着一种从喉咙里发出来的呜咽，最后，所有声响都融进一阵悲戚的哭嚎。"
"Except that it came from a woman’s throat it was exactly the babbling sound of a weeping child with a grievance.","这声音完全就像是一个孩子的哭诉，但可以确定的是，这是一个女人的声音。"
"“I can’t,” she said, “I can’t,” and that was all I could distinguish.","“我不能，”她说，“我不能。”这是我唯一能听清楚的话了。"
"It was to my young ears the strangest sound conceivable from a kindly motherly little woman, whom I had always thought of chiefly as an unparalleled maker of cakes.","对我尚为年轻的听觉来讲，这可以算是来自这位善良而慈爱的妇人发出的最奇怪的声音，在我心中，她一直将她看作是会做蛋糕的厨娘，且技艺无与伦比。"
"It frightened me.","这声音吓到我了。"
"I went upstairs at once in a state of infinite alarm, and there she was upon the landing, leaning forward over the top of the chest of drawers beside her open bedroom door, and weeping.","我立刻上了楼，看到她站在台阶上，身子前倾，靠着下面的柜子抽屉，旁边是卧室敞开的房门，她就在那里抽泣着。"
"I never saw such weeping.","我从未见她如此地抽泣过。"
"One thick strand of black hair had escaped, and hung with a spiral twist down her back; never before had I noticed that she had gray hairs.","一卷黑发落下来，粗硬的发丝在她的背上卷卷地垂着，这是我第一次发现，她的发丝已经有了灰色的痕迹。"
"As I came up upon the landing her voice rose again.","当我走上楼梯上的平台时，她的声音再次响了起来。"
"“Oh that I should have to tell you, Willie!","“哎，威利，我应该告诉你的！"
"Oh that I should have to tell you!”","我真该告诉你啊！”"
"She dropped her head again, and a fresh gust of tears swept all further words away.","她再一次低下了头，一行泪涌出眼眶，淹没了千言万语。"
"I said nothing, I was too astonished; but I drew nearer to her, and waited....","我惊得说不出话来，但我渐渐靠近了她，等待她开口……"
"I never saw such weeping; the extraordinary wetness of her dripping handkerchief abides with me to this day.","我从未见到那样的哭泣，直到现在，我对那块湿透了的手绢依然记忆犹新。"
"“That I should have lived to see this day!”","“我早该料到会有这么一天！”"

"“I had rather a thousand times she was struck dead at my feet.”","“我情愿她在我脚下死一千次！”"
"I began to understand.","我开始有些明白了。"
"“Mrs. Stuart,” I said, clearing my throat; “what has become of Nettie?”","“斯图尔特夫人，”我清了清嗓子说，“妮蒂到底怎么了？”"

"I waited till her passion abated.","我等着她冷静下来。"

"“Willie,” she gulped, “she’s gone!”","“威利，”她抽噎着说，“她走了！”"
"“Nettie?”","“妮蒂？”"
"“Gone!...","“走了！……"
"Run away....","逃走了……"
"Run away from her home.","离家出走了。"
"Oh, Willie, Willie!","噢，威利，威利！"
"The shame of it!","这事儿多丢人啊！"
"The sin and shame of it!”","真是罪过，丢人啊！”"
"She flung herself upon my shoulder, and clung to me, and began again to wish her daughter lying dead at our feet.","她靠在我的肩膀上，紧紧地贴着我，又开始说希望她女儿死在我们脚下的话。"
"“There, there,” said I, and all my being was a-tremble.","“等等，等等，”我全身颤抖着说，"
"“Where has she gone?”","“她去哪儿了？”"
"I said as softly as I could.","我尽力让自己的语气温和一些。"
"But for the time she was preoccupied with her own sorrow, and I had to hold her there, and comfort her with the blackness of finality spreading over my soul.","但那时她还沉浸在自己的悲痛中，我只好扶着她，安慰她，而我自己的灵魂却被这最终定局的黑暗笼罩着。"
"“Where has she gone?”","“她去哪儿了？”"
"I asked for the fourth time.","我问道，这已经是第四遍了。"
"“I don’t know—we don’t know.","“我不知道——我们都不知道。"

"‘Fine clo’s for a fine day,’ she said, and that was her last words to me!—Willie!—the child I suckled at my breast!”","‘祝你快乐每一天。’她说，这是她对我说的最后一句话！威利！这就是这个吃着我的奶长大的孩子跟我说的最后一句话！”"
"“Yes, yes.","“是，没错。"
"But where has she gone?”","但她去哪儿了呢？”"
"I said.","我问道。"
"She went on with sobs, and now telling her story with a sort of fragmentary hurry: “She went out bright and shining, out of this house for ever.","她依旧抽泣着，继续讲她的故事，声音断断续续而又急促：“她穿得光彩亮丽，永远地离开了这个家。"
"She was smiling, Willie—as if she was glad to be going.","她是笑着离开的，威利。看上去好像很开心能离开这里。"
"(“Glad to be going,” I echoed with soundless lips.) ‘You’re mighty fine for the morning,’ I says; ‘mighty fine.’","（“很开心能离开。”我无声地附和着这句话。）‘你今天早上真好，’我说，‘真好。’"
"‘Let the girl be pretty,’ says her father, ‘while she’s young!’","‘让那孩子臭美去吧，’他的父亲说，‘趁着她还年轻！’"
"And somewhere she’d got a parcel of her things hidden to pick up, and she was going off—out of this house for ever!”","她把自己的东西在某个地方收拾好了藏了起来，就是为了方便她带走，现在她走了——永远离开这个家了！”"
"She became quiet.","她平静了下来。"
"“Let the girl be pretty,” she repeated; “let the girl be pretty while she’s young....","“让那孩子臭美去吧，”她重复道，“让那孩子臭美吧，趁着她还年轻……"

"I wish she and me together were lying in our graves.”","我希望她能躺在我们的坟墓里。”"
"“But”—I moistened my lips and spoke slowly—“she may have gone to marry.”","“可是——”我舔了舔嘴唇，缓缓地说，“她有可能去结婚了。”"
"“If that was so!","“但愿如此！"

"Her handwriting bore no traces of emotion; it was round and upright and clear as though it had been done in a writing lesson.","从她的笔迹上看不出什么感情上的痕迹，字写得很工整，像是在练书法一样。"
"Always her letters were like masks upon her image; they fell like curtains before the changing charm of her face; one altogether forgot the sound of her light clear voice, confronted by a perplexing stereotyped thing that had mysteriously got a hold upon one’s heart and pride.","她的信常常就是她的面具，像幕帘一样在她百娇千魅的面孔落下。它曾像魔鬼一样侵入一个人的灵魂，攫走那些傲气，而现在面对这封令人不解而墨守成规的信，我却无法想起她清脆的声音。"

"“What’s to happen to him?”","“那他呢？”"
"He shook his head to show that problem was beyond him.","他摇摇头，表示他无法回答这个问题。"

"“Where am I to go?”","“我能去哪儿啊？”"

"He scratched slowly at his hairy cheek, opened his mouth, and shook his head.","他缓缓地挠着长满络腮胡须的脸，张了张口，摇了摇头。"
"Then, with an intolerable note of sluggish gentle wisdom, he said, “People of our sort, Willie, can’t do things like that.”","而后说：“威利，像我们这种人，是不可能做出那种事情的。”那语速慢得简直让人无法忍受。"
"I came near to raving.","我几乎要被他气疯了。"
"I had a wild impulse to strike him in the face.","有想一拳捶在他脸上的冲动。"
"Once in my boyhood I happened upon a bird terribly mangled by some cat, and killed it in a frenzy of horror and pity.","在我还是个孩子的时候，我曾经在偶然间看到一只被猫咬得不成样子的小鸟，我带着恐惧和怜悯结束了它的生命。"
"I had a gust of that same emotion now, as this shameful mutilated soul fluttered in the dust, before me.","而今当这个可悲的废物再次出现在我面前时，我再次有了这股冲动。"
"Then, you know, I dismissed him from the case.","后来，我想你们猜得到的，我打消了这个念头。"
"“May I look?”","“可以让我看看么？”"
"I asked.","我问。"
"He held out the envelope reluctantly.","他不情愿地将信封递给了我。"
"“There it is,” he said, and pointing with his garden-rough forefinger.","“给你，”他伸出常年在花园劳作的食指，"
"“I.A.P.A.M.P.","“I.A.P.A.M.P."
"What can you make of that?”","你能看出是哪儿么？”"
"I took the thing in my hands.","我接过信封。"
"The adhesive stamp customary in those days was defaced by a circular postmark, which bore the name of the office of departure and the date.","过去的邮戳是圆形的，总是盖在邮票上，上面印着发信时间和当地邮局的名称。"
"The impact in this particular case had been light or made without sufficient ink, and half the letters of the name had left no impression.","但这个邮戳盖得不是很清楚，油墨也不是很够。上面的地址有一半是看不清的。"
"I could distinguish—","我只能辨认出——"
"I A P A M P","I A P A M P"
"and very faintly below D.S.O.","以及下面模糊的D.S.O的墨迹。"
"I guessed the name in an instant flash of intuition.","灵光闪过，直觉告诉我，"
"It was Shaphambury.","那个地方是香普汉贝里（Shaphambury)。"
"The very gaps shaped that to my mind.","那看不清的字母让我联想到这个地方。"
"Perhaps in a sort of semi-visibility other letters were there, at least hinting themselves.","也许其他依稀可见的字母上，至少给了我这样的暗示。"
"It was a place somewhere on the east coast, I knew, either in Norfolk or Suffolk.","我知道那是东海岸的一个地方，不是在诺福克就是在萨福克。"
"“Why!”","“呀！”"
"cried I—and stopped.","我叫道——但却没有说下去。"
"What was the good of telling him?","告诉他又能有什么用呢？"
"Old Stuart had glanced up sharply, I am inclined to think almost fearfully, into my face.","老斯图尔特的双眼凌厉地望向我，盯得我有些发毛，我想我的脸上也流露出来这一神情了。"
"“You—you haven’t got it?”","“你——你没猜出来吧？”"
"he said.","他说。"
"Shaphambury—I should remember that.","香普汉贝里——我应该记得那个地方。"
"“You don’t think you got it?”","“你应该没看出来吧？”"
"he said.","他说。"
"I handed the envelope back to him.","我把信封还给他，"
"“For a moment I thought it might be Hampton,” I said.","“我一度觉得是汉普顿。”"
"“Hampton,” he repeated.","“汉普顿，”他重复道，"
"“Hampton.","“汉普顿。"
"How could you make Hampton?”","你怎么会想到这个地方呢？”"
"He turned the envelope about.","他又转过信封。"
"“H.A.M.—why, Willie, you’re a worse hand at the job than me!”","“H.A.M.——呵呵，威利，你还不如我呢！”"
"He replaced the letter in the envelope and stood erect to put this back in his breast pocket.","他重新将信装进信封，站直身体，将它放回胸前的口袋。"
"I did not mean to take any risks in this affair.","我不想在这件事儿上冒风险。"
"I drew a stump of pencil from my waistcoat pocket, turned a little away from him and wrote “Shaphambury” very quickly on my frayed and rather grimy shirt cuff.","我稍微转过身来避开他，从马甲口袋上拿出一根铅笔，将“香普汉贝里”迅速地写在我破旧的衬衣袖口上。"
"“Well,” said I, with an air of having done nothing remarkable.","“哦。”我若无其事地附和着。"
"I turned to him with some unimportant observation—I have forgotten what.","我转过身，察觉到了什么，也许是一些无关紧要的事情——我已经不记得了。"
"I never finished whatever vague remark I commenced.","但我当时没有放弃。"
"I looked up to see a third person waiting at the greenhouse door.","我抬起头来，发觉还有一个人站在暖房前。"
"Section 7","第七节"
"It was old Mrs. Verrall.","是维罗尔老太太。"
"I wonder if I can convey the effect of her to you.","我不知道我是否可以准确地描述她的样子。"
"She was a little old lady with extraordinarily flaxen hair, her weak aquiline features were pursed up into an assumption of dignity, and she was richly dressed.","她身材娇小，有着一头淡黄色的头发，柔弱的相貌中透着威严，穿着十分华丽。"
"I would like to underline that “richly dressed,” or have the words printed in florid old English or Gothic lettering.","我希望我可以在“穿着十分华丽”下面标上下划线，或者用老式花体或黑体标示出来。"
"No one on earth is now quite so richly dressed as she was, no one old or young indulges in so quiet and yet so profound a sumptuosity.","因为现在已经没有人能像她那样穿得那么考究，也没有人再像她那样如此沉溺在华丽的打扮中了。"
"But you must not imagine any extravagance of outline or any beauty or richness of color.","不过你不必要大肆想象她身材有多好，长得多美丽或是衣服的颜色有多么鲜艳。"
"The predominant colors were black and fur browns, and the effect of richness was due entirely to the extreme costliness of the materials employed.","她衣服的主色调只有黑色和皮棕色两种颜色。那华丽的效果完全源于那奢华的衣料。"
"She affected silk brocades with rich and elaborate patterns, priceless black lace over creamy or purple satin, intricate trimmings through which threads and bands of velvet wriggled, and in the winter rare furs.","她身穿精工锦缎，花样斑斓，鹅黄或紫色的绸缎上配着高级的黑色饰带，丝绒精细镶边，套着价格不菲的冬季皮大衣。"
"Her gloves fitted exquisitely, and ostentatiously simple chains of fine gold and pearls, and a great number of bracelets, laced about her little person.","她戴着手套，大小正合适。她虽身材娇弱，身上却佩戴着无数昂贵的金银珠宝的项链和手镯。"
"One was forced to feel that the slightest article she wore cost more than all the wardrobe of a dozen girls like Nettie; her bonnet affected the simplicity that is beyond rubies.","这一切都让人觉得，她身上最不值钱的一件东西都比一打妮蒂那样的女孩所有的衣服加起来值钱。她的帽子上镶着红宝石，看上去十分简约。"
"Richness, that is the first quality about this old lady that I would like to convey to you, and the second was cleanliness.","我想向你们描述的关于这位老妇人的第一个信息就是她很富有，第二个就是她相当整洁。"
"You felt that old Mrs. Verrall was exquisitely clean.","你会觉得维罗尔老太太实在是太整洁了。"
"If you had boiled my poor dear old mother in soda for a month you couldn’t have got her so clean as Mrs. Verrall constantly and manifestly was.","就算你让我那位可怜的老母亲在苏打水里泡上一个月，都不会有她那么整洁。"
"And pervading all her presence shone her third great quality, her manifest confidence in the respectful subordination of the world.","而当她渐渐出现在我的视线里时，她的第三个特点也就随之而来了，那便是目空一切。"
"She was pale and a little out of breath that day, but without any loss of her ultimate confidence, and it was clear to me that she had come to interview Stuart upon the outbreak of passion that had bridged the gulf between their families.","她那天面色苍白，呼吸急促，但那股子傲慢却丝毫不减。显然，她来这儿的目的就是要向斯图尔特说明那激情的爆发已经逾越了他们家族之间的鸿沟。"
"And here again I find myself writing in an unknown language, so far as my younger readers are concerned.","我不得不再次说明，我觉得我可能又会让年青一代的读者们觉得我在不知所云。"
"You who know only the world that followed the Great Change will find much that I am telling inconceivable.","你知道在巨变后世界生活的人会都觉得我所讲的一切都是匪夷所思的。"
"Upon these points I cannot appeal, as I have appealed for other confirmations, to the old newspapers; these were the things that no one wrote about because every one understood and every one had taken up an attitude.","对于这些观点，我不能再像之前那样，拿旧报纸出来作为佐证。没有人写过这些事儿，因为每个人都能理解，也得有自己的态度。"
"There were in England and America, and indeed throughout the world, two great informal divisions of human beings—the Secure and the Insecure.","在英国、美国甚至全世界，人都被分成两类，即上层人士和下层人士。"
"There was not and never had been in either country a nobility—it was and remains a common error that the British peers were noble—neither in law nor custom were there noble families, and we altogether lacked the edification one found in Russia, for example, of a poor nobility.","世界上的任何一个国家，无论是过去还是现在都不存在什么贵族——人们有种错误的共识，觉得英国的贵族很高贵，然而无论是在法令中还是在习俗中，其实都没有什么高贵可言。大家都缺乏对高贵的正确理解。"
"A peerage was an hereditary possession that, like the family land, concerned only the eldest sons of the house; it radiated no luster of noblesse oblige.","爵位是世袭的，就像家产一向都会传给长子一样，这本身就没有什么贵族的光辉可言。"
"The rest of the world were in law and practice common—and all America was common.","世界上其他国家的法律和准则都是有共识的，整个美国也是有共识的。"
"But through the private ownership of land that had resulted from the neglect of feudal obligations in Britain and the utter want of political foresight in the Americas, large masses of property had become artificially stable in the hands of a small minority, to whom it was necessary to mortgage all new public and private enterprises, and who were held together not by any tradition of service and nobility but by the natural sympathy of common interests and a common large scale of living.","但由于英国忽视了封建强权导致了土地私有制这一事实，美国缺乏政治眼光，这就使得大多数的财产流失到少数人手中，从而集体和私人企业都不得不抵押给这一少部分人。这部分人聚在一起的原因与高尚和世袭无关，仅仅是因为他们有着共同的利益和相同的生活圈子。"
"It was a class without any very definite boundaries; vigorous individualities, by methods for the most part violent and questionable, were constantly thrusting themselves from insecurity to security, and the sons and daughters of secure people, by marrying insecurity or by wild extravagance or flagrant vice, would sink into the life of anxiety and insufficiency which was the ordinary life of man.","这个阶级并没有什么明确的界限。有能力的人可以通过暴力和不法手段从下层进入上层。上层人的儿女们如果和下层人同伙，过于挥霍抑或是干了什么臭名远扬的事儿，也会身价暴跌，过着和普通人一样艰苦、贫寒的日子。"
"The rest of the population was landless and, except by working directly or indirectly for the Secure, had no legal right to exist.","没有土地的人于是成为上层人直接或间接的劳工，连合法的生存权都没有。"
"And such was the shallowness and insufficiency of our thought, such the stifled egotism of all our feelings before the Last Days, that very few indeed of the Secure could be found to doubt that this was the natural and only conceivable order of the world.","在巨变前最后的日子里，我们的思想就是这样的浅薄和不足，充斥着令人窒息的利己主义。而事实上，几乎所有的上层人士都觉得世界秩序就应该是这样的，这些令人窒息的个人利己主义是理所当然且合情合理的。"
"It is the life of the Insecure under the old order that I am displaying, and I hope that I am conveying something of its hopeless bitterness to you, but you must not imagine that the Secure lived lives of paradisiacal happiness.","接着就让我向你们描述一下旧秩序下下层人们的生存状况吧。我希望你们能体会到他们生活的痛苦和绝望，但也不要以为上层人士们就一定生活在幸福的天堂里。"
"The pit of insecurity below them made itself felt, even though it was not comprehended.","尽管这也许让人觉得难以想象，但下层人士就像是生活在一个无底深渊里。"
"Life about them was ugly; the sight of ugly and mean houses, of ill-dressed people, the vulgar appeals of the dealers in popular commodities, were not to be escaped.","他们的生活惨不忍睹。到处都是简陋的房屋和衣不蔽体的人们。小商小贩粗鄙的叫卖声不绝于耳。"
"There was below the threshold of their minds an uneasiness; they not only did not think clearly about social economy but they displayed an instinctive disinclination to think.","他们终日惶恐不安，不但不会清醒地分析社会经济状况，而且本能地反感思考。"
"Their security was not so perfect that they had not a dread of falling towards the pit, they were always lashing themselves by new ropes, their cultivation of “connexions,” of interests, their desire to confirm and improve their positions, was a constant ignoble preoccupation.","他们的生活原本就没有完善的生活保障，因此他们对于陷入痛苦生活的深渊也没有什么害怕可言，在他们的意识中所形成的所谓“关系”、利益、确保和改善自身地位的欲望，就毫无高尚可言了。"
"You must read Thackeray to get the full flavor of their lives.","想要全面了解他们的生活，你必须读读萨克雷这本书。"
"Then the bacterium was apt to disregard class distinctions, and they were never really happy in their servants.","细菌是很易于忽视阶级之间的差别的。这些人对佣人有异乎寻常的挑剔。"
"Read their surviving books.","看看他们所留下来的书吧。"
"Each generation bewails the decay of that “fidelity” of servants, no generation ever saw.","每代人都在感叹他们的仆人是多么史无前例地不忠诚。"
"A world that is squalid in one corner is squalid altogether, but that they never understood.","一个世界有一个这样的黑暗的角落，全社会也就会变得肮脏。"
"They believed there was not enough of anything to go round, they believed that this was the intention of God and an incurable condition of life, and they held passionately and with a sense of right to their disproportionate share.","但他们却不懂这点。他们坚信没有什么是够所有人分配的，觉得那就是上帝的旨意，没有人能改变。他们心甘情愿地接受这样的不平等分配，甚至认为这是他们的权利。"
"They maintained a common intercourse as “Society” of all who were practically secure, and their choice of that word is exhaustively eloquent of the quality of their philosophy.","他们和所有上层“社会”的人士保持着往来。用“社会”这个字眼是因为这是体现他们处事原则的最好、最彻底的方式。"
"But, if you can master these alien ideas upon which the old system rested, just in the same measure will you understand the horror these people had for marriages with the Insecure.","然而，如果你能完全明白这些支撑旧体制的矛盾思想，你也就能理解上层人士恐惧与下层人士结亲的原因。"
"In the case of their girls and women it was extraordinarily rare, and in the case of either sex it was regarded as a disastrous social crime.","上层阶级的女子很少出现这种情况，但不管男女，这种婚姻都算得上是一种不可赦免的社会罪行。"
"Anything was better than that.","没有什么事儿能比这个更严重了。"
"You are probably aware of the hideous fate that was only too probably the lot, during those last dark days, of every girl of the insecure classes who loved and gave way to the impulse of self-abandonment without marriage, and so you will understand the peculiar situation of Nettie with young Verrall.","现在你应该可以意识在那些黑暗的日子里，下层阶级的女孩子在结婚前谈情说爱、自我放逐可能造成的可怕的命运了，从而也就能明白妮蒂和小维罗尔所身处的特殊情况。"
"One or other had to suffer.","他们之间一定会有一个受害者。"
"And as they were both in a state of great emotional exaltation and capable of strange generosities toward each other, it was an open question and naturally a source of great anxiety to a mother in Mrs. Verrall’s position, whether the sufferer might not be her son—whether as the outcome of that glowing irresponsible commerce Nettie might not return prospective mistress of Checkshill Towers.","但因为他们两个正处于热恋中，慷慨而毫无保留地爱着彼此。作为母亲的立场，维罗尔太太自然心急如焚。受害者万一是自己的儿子怎么办——要是他们发生了关系，妮蒂回来之后是不是就成不了切克希利家族新的女主人呢？"
"The chances were greatly against that conclusion, but such things did occur.","他们本不可能在一起的，但这事儿却实实在在地发生了。"
"These laws and customs sound, I know, like a record of some nasty-minded lunatic’s inventions.","我知道这些法律和风俗听起来就像一个下流的杀人狂在疯言疯语。"
"They were invincible facts in that vanished world into which, by some accident, I had been born, and it was the dream of any better state of things that was scouted as lunacy.","而这些在那个逝去的世界里却是真实地存在着的，而我又偏偏生在那个世界里，这个事实真是令人难以置信，这简直就像是一场梦，比神经病患者的还要严重。"
"Just think of it!","想想吧！"
"This girl I loved with all my soul, for whom I was ready to sacrifice my life, was not good enough to marry young Verrall.","我曾全心全意爱过的女孩，我曾准备为她付出生命的女孩，她竟然不配和小维罗尔生结婚。"
"And I had only to look at his even, handsome, characterless face to perceive a creature weaker and no better than myself.","我却只能看着他匀称、英俊而毫无个性的面孔，再怎么看都觉得他比我脆弱，不如我。"
"She was to be his pleasure until he chose to cast her aside, and the poison of our social system had so saturated her nature—his evening dress, his freedom and his money had seemed so fine to her and I so clothed in squalor—that to that prospect she had consented.","她曾为他带来快乐，直到有一天他抛弃她。我们的社会体制侵蚀了她的心灵——他高档的宴会礼服，无忧无虑、自由自在的生活，和挥霍不完的财富，这一切对她来说都太有诱惑力了。而我却破衣烂衫，相比之下，她选择了他。"
"And to resent the social conventions that created their situation, was called “class envy,” and gently born preachers reproached us for the mildest resentment against an injustice no living man would now either endure or consent to profit by.","如果有人憎恨造成这种局面的社会习俗，这些人就会被谴责为“阶级嫉妒者”，生来慈善的牧师会因此而责怪我们。但如今只要是活着的人，都不会忍受，更不会认同这种利益的不公平分配。"
"What was the sense of saying “peace” when there was no peace?","既然世界都没有什么和平可言，那大肆谈论“和平”又有何意义？"
"If there was one hope in the disorders of that old world it lay in revolt and conflict to the death.","如果说这个乌烟瘴气的旧世界还有一丝希望，那就是事关生死的反抗和斗争。"
"But if you can really grasp the shameful grotesqueness of the old life, you will begin to appreciate the interpretation of old Mrs. Verrall’s appearance that leapt up at once in my mind.","但如果你确实能领悟到旧生活的可耻与荒谬，你就能明白随即浮现在我脑中所理解的维罗尔太太此行的目的了。"
"She had come to compromise the disaster!","她是来向这一灾难妥协的！"
"And the Stuarts WOULD compromise!","斯图尔特夫妇是愿意妥协的！"
"I saw that only too well.","我早就看透他们了。"
"An enormous disgust at the prospect of the imminent encounter between Stuart and his mistress made me behave in a violent and irrational way.","一想到斯图尔特夫妇和维罗尔太太即将进行的交易，我就气不打一处来，我的举止也因此变得不理智。"
"I wanted to escape seeing that, seeing even Stuart’s first gesture in that, at any cost.","无论怎样，我都不想看到这一切，甚至连老斯图尔特的第一个手势都不愿意看到。"
"“I’m off,” said I, and turned my back on him without any further farewell.","“我先告辞了。”我转过身背着他说，不再多说一句告别的话。"
"My line of retreat lay by the old lady, and so I advanced toward her.","我退回去的路不得不绕过那位老太太，于是我向她走去。"
"I saw her expression change, her mouth fell a little way open, her forehead wrinkled, and her eyes grew round.","我看到她神情的变化，她的嘴巴微微张着，额头上爬满了周围，瞪着眼睛。"
"She found me a queer customer even at the first sight, and there was something in the manner of my advance that took away her breath.","她甚至一眼就看出我是个奇怪的客人，我走路的样子中有种东西让她气得透不过气来。"
"She stood at the top of the three or four steps that descended to the level of the hothouse floor.","她站在台阶上端，距暖房的房屋地板仅有三四个台阶的距离。"
"She receded a pace or two, with a certain offended dignity at the determination of my rush.","看到我要冲过去，她像是被冒犯了一样，气呼呼地傲慢地向后退了一两步。"
"I gave her no sort of salutation.","我没有对她表示半点儿尊敬。"
"Well, as a matter of fact, I did give her a sort of salutation.","而事实上，我对她也表示了某种尊敬。"
"There is no occasion for me to begin apologizing now for the thing I said to her—I strip these things before you—if only I can get them stark enough you will understand and forgive.","现在这样的场合我没有必要为自己对她的话说什么抱歉——只要我把一切说清楚，相信你们会理解、原谅我的。"
"I was filled with a brutal and overpowering desire to insult her.","我当时只有一种直截了当的欲望想羞辱她。"
"And so I addressed this poor little expensive old woman in the following terms, converting her by a violent metonymy into a comprehensive plural.","于是我对那位娇小可怜而衣着华丽的夫人说了以下这番话，用一个措辞激烈的比喻将她比作一个综合体。"
"“You infernal land thieves!”","“你这个讨厌的土地小偷！”"
"I said point-blank into her face.","我对着她直截了当地说，"
"“HAVE YOU COME TO OFFER THEM MONEY?”","“你是给他们送钱来的吧？”"
"And without waiting to test her powers of repartee I passed rudely beyond her and vanished, striding with my fists clenched, out of her world again...","未等她回过神来反驳，我就紧紧握着拳头，大步流星地从她身边走了过去，又一次消失在她的视线中。"
"I have tried since to imagine how the thing must have looked to her.","之后我一直在想她会怎样看待这件事。"
"So far as her particular universe went I had not existed at all, or I had existed only as a dim black thing, an insignificant speck, far away across her park in irrelevant, unimportant transit, until this moment when she came, sedately troubled, into her own secure gardens and sought for Stuart among the greenhouses.","对于她那特殊的生活圈子而言，在那次之前，根本就不存在我这个人。即使存在也不过是个模糊的黑色的影子，一个无足轻重的人，与她的园地毫不相干。而当那天，她满腹心事地来到自己的花园，到绿色暖房里找斯图尔特夫妇时，才发现了我的存在。"
"Then abruptly I flashed into being down that green-walled, brick-floored vista as a black-avised, ill-clad young man, who first stared and then advanced scowling toward her.","而破衣烂衫的我却突然跳进这排绿色砖墙、地上铺着砖的房间，先是瞪着她，而后皱着眉头冲向她。"
"Once in existence I developed rapidly.","我一旦在她的世界中出现，便不可忽视。"
"I grew larger in perspective and became more and more important and sinister every moment.","我的行为愈加猖狂，每一时每一刻都愈加重要，愈加透着不祥的预兆。"
"I came up the steps with inconceivable hostility and disrespect in my bearing, towered over her, becoming for an instant at least a sort of second French Revolution, and delivered myself with the intensest concentration of those wicked and incomprehensible words.","我满心敌意，毫不客气地走上台阶俯视着她，那一刻的局面简直不逊于第二次法国大革命，紧接着我又莫名而恶狠狠地甩了那些话给她。"
"Just for a second I threatened annihilation.","一时间我如释重负。"
"Happily that was my climax.","像是复仇成功一般，心里非常舒服。"
"And then I had gone by, and the Universe was very much as it had always been except for the wild swirl in it, and the faint sense of insecurity my episode left in its wake.","而后我快步走过，除了有些凌乱的步伐外，世界又恢复了原样。上文中说到的头晕目眩的下层人民终于觉醒了。"
"The thing that never entered my head in those days was that a large proportion of the rich were rich in absolute good faith.","从前我从未想过的就是大部分富人都有着崇高的信仰。"
"I thought they saw things exactly as I saw them, and wickedly denied.","我曾一度以为他们对待事物的方式和我一样，对任何事物都持邪恶的否定态度。"
"But indeed old Mrs. Verrall was no more capable of doubting the perfection of her family’s right to dominate a wide country side, than she was of examining the Thirty-nine Articles or dealing with any other of the adamantine pillars upon which her universe rested in security.","而事实上维罗尔太太不会怀疑她家垄断这一广阔乡村的完美权利，也没能力检查39项条款，或者去应对她能过上优越生活的坚挺支柱。"
"No doubt I startled and frightened her tremendously.","毋庸置疑，她对于我的行为大为惊诧。"
"But she could not understand.","但是她不明白这到底是为什么。"
"None of her sort of people ever did seem to understand such livid flashes of hate, as ever and again lit the crowded darkness below their feet.","像她这类人似乎永远不会明白，正是这种怨恨苍白的光一次次照亮了他们脚下的极度黑暗。"
"The thing leapt out of the black for a moment and vanished, like a threatening figure by a desolate roadside lit for a moment by one’s belated carriage-lamp and then swallowed up by the night.","这些怨恨跳出黑暗，瞬间隐没，像是荒凉路边迟来的马车车灯一样，瞬间照亮了黑暗却又在黑暗的夜色中消失。"
"They counted it with nightmares, and did their best to forget what was evidently as insignificant as it was disturbing.","他们在噩梦中思考着这一切，却又尽力从脑中将这些当作无关紧要的东西挥去。"

"Chapter the Fourth","第四章"
"War","战争"
"Section 1","第一节"
"FROM that moment when I insulted old Mrs. Verrall I became representative, I was a man who stood for all the disinherited of the world.","自从我羞辱维罗尔老太太的那一刻起，我就成为了一名代表，代表世上所有没有世袭爵位的人们。"
"I had no hope of pride or pleasure left in me, I was raging rebellion against God and mankind.","尊严和快乐从此便从我的生活中消失了，我是上帝与人类愤怒的对抗者。"
"There were no more vague intentions swaying me this way and that; I was perfectly clear now upon what I meant to do.","除此之外，在没有其他什么模糊的意图在我心里酝酿，我清楚地知道我要做什么。"
"I would make my protest and die.","我要反抗，然后死去。"
"I would make my protest and die.","我要反抗，然后死去。"
"I was going to kill Nettie—Nettie who had smiled and promised and given herself to another, and who stood now for all the conceivable delightfulnesses, the lost imaginations of the youthful heart, the unattainable joys in life; and Verrall who stood for all who profited by the incurable injustice of our social order.","我要杀了妮蒂——她曾经对我微笑，曾经与我许下诺言，最后却投入他人怀抱。现在她仍然是我能想象的最大快乐，她是我已经失去的青春梦想，是我现在可望而不可即的幸福。维罗尔则代表了我们受惠于这个不可救药的不公平的社会制度。"
"I would kill them both.","我要杀了他们两个。"
"And that being done I would blow my brains out and see what vengeance followed my blank refusal to live.","然后我会对着自己脑门开一枪，看看我断然拒绝生存之后，会招来什么人复仇。"
"So indeed I was resolved.","我就这样下定了决心。"
"I raged monstrously.","我的愤怒在燃烧。"
"And above me, abolishing the stars, triumphant over the yellow waning moon that followed it below, the giant meteor towered up towards the zenith.","头顶上，星光闪耀，衬托着暗淡昏黄的月牙，一颗巨大的流星划过天际。"
"“Let me only kill!”","“保佑我杀了他们吧！”"
"I cried.","我喊道，"
"“Let me only kill!”","“就让我杀了他们吧！”"
"So I shouted in my frenzy.","我就这样疯狂地怒吼着。"
"I was in a fever that defied hunger and fatigue; for a long time I had prowled over the heath towards Lowchester talking to myself, and now that night had fully come I was tramping homeward, walking the long seventeen miles without a thought of rest.","我热血沸腾，完全忘记了饥饿和疲劳，我一路喃喃自语，疯狂地从荒原向罗彻斯特前进。直到现在天色完全暗下来的时候，我才想起来回家，一口气走了十七英里长的路程。"
"And I had eaten nothing since the morning.","我从早上到现在什么都没吃。"
"I suppose I must count myself mad, but I can recall my ravings.","我想我一定是疯了，但我还能记起当时说的一些疯言疯语。"
"There were times when I walked weeping through that brightness that was neither night nor day.","在那片光亮中，我时不时会默默流泪，那片光亮既非黑夜，也非白天。"
"There were times when I reasoned in a topsy-turvy fashion with what I called the Spirit of All Things.","我也时不时会颠三倒四地解释我所谓的“万物之灵”理论。"
"But always I spoke to that white glory in the sky.","但大多数时候，我不过是在质问苍天。"
"“Why am I here only to suffer ignominies?”","“凭什么我要在这里蒙羞？”"
"I asked.","我质问道，"
"“Why have you made me with pride that cannot be satisfied, with desires that turn and rend me?","“为什么不能满足我的自尊，打消我的欲望，撕裂我的感情？"
"Is it a jest, this world—a joke you play on your guests?","你这是在和我开玩笑么，这世道——你就是这样跟你的客人开玩笑么？"
"I—even I—have a better humor than that!”","我——就算是我——也不会开这种低俗的玩笑啊！”"
"“Why not learn from me a certain decency of mercy?","“你就不能向我学学，学得仁慈一点儿，正派一点儿吗？"
"Why not undo?","你还没折腾够吗？"
"Have I ever tormented—day by day, some wretched worm—making filth for it to trail through, filth that disgusts it, starving it, bruising it, mocking it?","我有像你这样折腾人吗——整日整夜地折磨过一只倒霉的虫子吗——让它们必须在粪堆里爬行，令它们忍饥挨饿、伤痕累累，还要冷嘲热讽，我有这样做过吗？"
"Why should you?","但你为什么要这么对我呢？"
"Your jokes are clumsy.","这个玩笑也太低俗了。"
"Try—try some milder fun up there; do you hear?","你能不能来点儿温和的游戏，听到了吗？"
"Something that doesn’t hurt so infernally.”","不要开这种地狱般的玩笑了。＂"
"“You say this is your purpose—your purpose with me.","“你说，你就是要这样，就要这样教导我。"
"You are making something with me—birth pangs of a soul.","你要让我明白一点——一个灵魂的出生之苦。"
"Ah!","哎！"
"How can I believe you?","你要我如何相信你呢？"
"You forget I have eyes for other things.","你不要忘了，我的眼睛还看到了别的东西呢。"
"Let my own case go, but what of that frog beneath the cart-wheel, God?—and the bird the cat had torn?”","先把我的事情放在一边不谈，为什么要让一只青蛙死在车轮下？我的上帝？还有那只被猫扯得血肉模糊的小鸟？”"
"And after such blasphemies I would fling out a ridiculous little debating society hand.","发泄完这样一番亵渎神明的话之后，我失去了理智，开始发狂地向这个世道讨说法："
"“Answer me that!”","“回答我！”"
"A week ago it had been moonlight, white and black and hard across the spaces of the park, but now the light was livid and full of the quality of haze.","一个星期之前，花园里月光溶溶，月色的清辉和黑色的暗影在公园里相互映衬，而今却是月色苍白，一片模糊。"
"An extraordinarily low white mist, not three feet above the ground, drifted broodingly across the grass, and the trees rose ghostly out of that phantom sea.","白色雾气出奇地低，离地不到三英尺，低压压地漂浮着，笼罩着草地，树木如幽灵般直立在那阴森森的气氛里。"
"Great and shadowy and strange was the world that night, no one seemed abroad; I and my little cracked voice drifted solitary through the silent mysteries.","那天晚上，一切都显得那么陌生、蒙眬而空旷，四下无人，只有我些许沙哑的声音游荡在安静而神秘的夜里。"
"Sometimes I argued as I have told, sometimes I tumbled along in moody vacuity, sometimes my torment was vivid and acute.","有时我会像之前那样争论不休，有时会怅然若失地游走，有时又被嫉妒的烦躁包围。"
"Abruptly out of apathy would come a boiling paroxysm of fury, when I thought of Nettie mocking me and laughing, and of her and Verrall clasped in one another’s arms.","一想到妮蒂欺骗了我的感情，正在一旁嘲笑我，想到她正和小维罗尔你侬我侬，我就会从麻木中惊醒，瞬间怒火中烧。"
"“I will not have it so!”","“我绝不会姑息这一切的！”"
"I screamed.","我怒吼道，"
"“I will not have it so!”","“我绝不会姑息这一切的！”"
"And in one of these raving fits I drew my revolver from my pocket and fired into the quiet night.","有次我忍不住心中的怒火，不由得掏出手枪，对着沉寂的夜空开了火，"
"Three times I fired it.","一连三枪。"
"The bullets tore through the air, the startled trees told one another in diminishing echoes the thing I had done, and then, with a slow finality, the vast and patient night healed again to calm.","子弹划过天际，在惊慌的树林传出一阵阵回响，而后随着最后一道回声穿来，空旷而耐着性子的夜空渐渐恢复了平静。"
"My shots, my curses and blasphemies, my prayers—for anon I prayed—that Silence took them all.","我的枪声、我的诅咒、我亵渎神明的发泄、我的祈祷——这一切都被夜的寂静吞没。"
"It was—how can I express it?—a stifled outcry tranquilized, lost, amid the serene assumptions, the overwhelming empire of that brightness.","我该怎么描述呢？这是一种在寂静的迷失之夜行将窒息的发泄，那夜晚静谧而高贵，却承受着白昼压倒一切的统治。"
"The noise of my shots, the impact upon things, had for the instant been enormous, then it had passed away.","枪声和其对外界的冲击是巨大的，可也是转瞬即逝的。"
"I found myself standing with the revolver held up, astonished, my emotions penetrated by something I could not understand.","我发现自己举着枪站在那里，惊惶失措，似乎自己的感情被一种无法理解的东西戳穿了。"
"Then I looked up over my shoulder at the great star, and remained staring at it.","而后我抬头望向天空，死死地盯着那颗巨大的恒星。"
"“Who are YOU?”","“你是谁？”"
"I said at last.","我终于开口问。"
"I was like a man in a solitary desert who has suddenly heard a voice....","我像是站在一片荒芜的沙漠中，突然听到一个声音……"
"That, too, passed.","而这声音也随即消失了。"
"As I came over Clayton Crest I recalled that I missed the multitude that now night after night walked out to stare at the comet, and the little preacher in the waste beyond the hoardings, who warned sinners to repent before the Judgment, was not in his usual place.","当我到了克莱顿峰顶时，我记得我怀念那些每晚都出来看彗星的大批的人，还有那曾经常在招贴板外废弃的地方，告诫有罪的众生在最后的审判日前忏悔的小牧师。"
"It was long past midnight, and every one had gone home.","那时已过午夜，所有人都回家了。"
"But I did not think of this at first, and the solitude perplexed me and left a memory behind.","可当时我却没意识到这些，那片荒地让我觉得很困惑，给我留下的印象极深。"
"The gas-lamps were all extinguished because of the brightness of the comet, and that too was unfamiliar.","彗星的光亮使所有的煤油灯都变得暗淡，这一切都是那么的陌生。"
"The little newsagent in the still High Street had shut up and gone to bed, but one belated board had been put out late and forgotten, and it still bore its placard.","大街上一片寂静，卖报的小贩早已收摊回去休息了，只剩下那个被遗忘了的迟来的招贴板立在那里，上面贴着布告。"
"The word upon it—there was but one word upon it in staring letters—was: “WAR.”","上面的字——只有一个用鲜艳颜色突出的词——“战争”。"
"You figure that empty mean street, emptily echoing to my footsteps—no soul awake and audible but me.","你可以想象，整条街空无一人，回荡着我自己的脚步声，除了我以外，所有人都已经在睡梦中。"
"Then my halt at the placard.","我在招贴板前驻足。"
"And amidst that sleeping stillness, smeared hastily upon the board, a little askew and crumpled, but quite distinct beneath that cool meteoric glare, preposterous and appalling, the measureless evil of that word—","在睡意蒙眬间我随即匆匆将布告弄皱、弄歪。但在那阴森的亮光下，这个罪恶的词还是那么刺眼——"
"“WAR!”","“战争！”"
"Section 2","第二节"
"I awoke in that state of equanimity that so often follows an emotional drenching.","我在平静中醒来，却全身是汗。"
"It was late, and my mother was beside my bed.","已经不早了，母亲坐在我床边，"
"She had some breakfast for me on a battered tray.","她为我准备了早点，放在一个旧托盘里。"
"“Don’t get up yet, dear,” she said.","“亲爱的，别急着起来，”她说，"
"“You’ve been sleeping.","“你一直在昏睡。"
"It was three o’clock when you got home last night.","你昨天回来时已经凌晨三点了。"
"You must have been tired out.”","你一定是累坏了。”"
"“Your poor face,” she went on, “was as white as a sheet and your eyes shining....","“看看你的脸，”她继续说，“苍白的像床单一样，眼睛泛着泪光……"
"It frightened me to let you in.","我吓坏了，赶紧让你进来。"
"And you stumbled on the stairs.”","你上楼时摔了一跤。”"
"My eyes went quietly to my coat pocket, where something still bulged.","我偷偷望向我的外衣，口袋还是鼓着的。"
"She probably had not noticed.","她应该还没有注意到里面有支枪。"
"“I went to Checkshill,” I said.","“我到切克希利去了。”我说，"
"“You know—perhaps—?”","“你可能知道——？”"
"“I got a letter last evening, dear,” and as she bent near me to put the tray upon my knees, she kissed my hair softly.","“我昨晚收到了一封信，亲爱的，”她向着我弯下了腰，把托盘放在我的膝盖上，轻轻地吻着我的头发。"
"For a moment we both remained still, resting on that, her cheek just touching my head.","我们一度就这样静静地靠着彼此，一动不动，她的面颊轻轻靠着我的头。"
"I took the tray from her to end the pause.","我从她那儿拿起托盘，终止了这样的状态。"
"“Don’t touch my clothes, mummy,” I said sharply, as she moved towards them.","“妈妈，别动我的衣服。”当她走进我的衣服时，我厉声说，"
"“I’m still equal to a clothes-brush.”","“这点衣服我还是能洗的。”"
"And then, as she turned away, I astonished her by saying, “You dear mother, you!","而当她转过身时，我接下来的话就吓到她了，我说：“我亲爱的妈妈，你！"
"A little—I understand.","我现在有点儿明白你的意思了。"
"Only—now—dear mother; oh!","但是现在，我亲爱的妈妈，哦！"
"let me be!","让我一个人静静吧。"
"Let me be!”","一个人！”"
"And, with the docility of a good servant, she went from me.","母亲听后，像个顺从的仆人一样退出了房间，留下我一个人。"
"Dear heart of submission that the world and I had used so ill!","我亲爱的妈妈，你这颗柔顺的心，却遭到我和这个世界的蹂躏！"
"It seemed to me that morning that I could never give way to a gust of passion again.","那天早上我似乎没再发怒。"
"A sorrowful firmness of the mind possessed me.","悲伤而坚定的决心充斥在我脑海中。"
"My purpose seemed now as inflexible as iron; there was neither love nor hate nor fear left in me—only I pitied my mother greatly for all that was still to come.","当下我似乎意志坚定，固不可摧，爱恨或恐惧都不存于心中——唯一的牵挂就是我可怜的母亲将要面对的事。"
"I ate my breakfast slowly, and thought where I could find out about Shaphambury, and how I might hope to get there.","我慢慢地吃着早餐，想着去哪儿找有关香普汉贝里的信息，如何才能到那儿。"
"I had not five shillings in the world.","而那时，我的全部财产连五个先令都没有。"
"I dressed methodically, choosing the least frayed of my collars, and shaving much more carefully than was my wont; then I went down to the Public Library to consult a map.","我挑了一件衣领磨损最少的衣服，不紧不慢地套在身上，比以往更为认真地刮了胡子，然后去公共图书馆查地图。"
"Shaphambury was on the coast of Essex, a long and complicated journey from Clayton.","香普汉贝里在埃塞克斯郡海岸，从克莱顿去那里的旅途遥远而复杂。"
"I went to the railway-station and made some memoranda from the time-tables.","我去火车站查了火车时刻表，抄下了火车车次和发车时间。"
"The porters I asked were not very clear about Shaphambury, but the booking-office clerk was helpful, and we puzzled out all I wanted to know.","我问到的值班人员都不太清楚香普汉贝里这个地方在哪儿，不过售票员倒是帮了我不少忙，告诉我想知道的所有信息。"
"Then I came out into the coaly street again.","而后我又回到了那昏暗的街道里。"
"At the least I ought to have two pounds.","我至少得有两个英镑才能出发。"
"I went back to the Public Library and into the newspaper room to think over this problem.","我再次坐在公共图书管理，在阅览室发愁。"
"A fact intruded itself upon me.","而眼前的事情却吸引了我的视线。"
"People seemed in an altogether exceptional stir about the morning journals, there was something unusual in the air of the room, more people and more talking than usual, and for a moment I was puzzled.","似乎人们都在为晨报那些误导的消息而惶恐不安，室内的气氛和往常很不一样，人比平常更多，谈论得也更激烈，一时间我有点儿不解。"
"Then I bethought me: “This war with Germany, of course!”","接着我恍然大悟：“当然是在谈论对德开战的事情！”"
"A naval battle was supposed to be in progress in the North Sea.","北海可能会有战事。"
"Let them!","管它呢！"
"I returned to the consideration of my own affairs.","我接着想自己的打算。"
"Parload?","帕罗德？"
"Could I go and make it up with him, and then borrow?","我能不能跟他和好如初，再向他借点钱呢？"
"I weighed the chances of that.","我掂量着成功的几率。"
"Then I thought of selling or pawning something, but that seemed difficult.","后来我又想着能不能变卖或是当点什么，不过这似乎很困难。"
"My winter overcoat had not cost a pound when it was new, my watch was not likely to fetch many shillings.","我冬天穿的大衣新买的时候都没到一英镑，手表也值不了几个先令。"
"Still, both these things might be factors.","况且，这两样又都是必需品。"
"I thought with a certain repugnance of the little store my mother was probably making for the rent.","我忐忑地想着母亲出租房屋也许会有一些积蓄。"
"She was very secretive about that, and it was locked in an old tea-caddy in her bedroom.","但她对此向来绝口不提，只把钱所在她卧室的旧式茶几里。"
"I knew it would be almost impossible to get any of that money from her willingly, and though I told myself that in this issue of passion and death no detail mattered, I could not get rid of tormenting scruples whenever I thought of that tea-caddy.","我知道她是不可能心甘情愿地把钱给我的。虽然我告诉自己没有什么能比这场生死恋更为重要，但一想到那个茶几，我就会踌躇起来。"
"Was there no other course?"
"Perhaps after every other source had been tapped I might supplement with a few shillings frankly begged from her.","或许我可以向母亲坦白，求她给我几先令——如果四处凑还是凑不齐的话。"
"“These others,” I said to myself, thinking without passion for once of the sons of the Secure, “would find it difficult to run their romances on a pawnshop basis.","“这些人,”我自顾自地说，第一次冷静地想到上层人士的花花公子们，“如果靠典当东西过活就很难继续浪漫下去。"
"However, we must manage it.”","但是我们必须想办法应付过去。”"
"I felt the day was passing on, but I did not get excited about that.","我感觉到一天正接近尾声，却完全提不起精神。"
"“Slow is swiftest,” Parload used to say, and I meant to get everything thought out completely, to take a long aim and then to act as a bullet flies.","帕罗德以前常说“欲速则不达”，所以我要把每步计划都想好，这样才能更快地达到目的。"
"I hesitated at a pawnshop on my way home to my midday meal, but I determined not to pledge my watch until I could bring my overcoat also.","在回家吃午饭的路上，我在典当铺的门口犹豫了很久，最终决定把手表和外套当掉。"
"I ate silently, revolving plans.","我默默地吃着饭，心里盘算着那些计划。"
"Section 3","第三节"
"After our midday dinner—it was a potato-pie, mostly potato with some scraps of cabbage and bacon—I put on my overcoat and got it out of the house while my mother was in the scullery at the back.","吃过午饭后——其实所谓午饭不过是一个土豆饼，里面大部分都是土豆，零星地夹着一点蔬菜和熏肉——我穿上大衣，趁母亲洗碗的空当出了家门。"
"A scullery in the old world was, in the case of such houses as ours, a damp, unsavory, mainly subterranean region behind the dark living-room kitchen, that was rendered more than typically dirty in our case by the fact that into it the coal-cellar, a yawning pit of black uncleanness, opened, and diffused small crunchable particles about the uneven brick floor.","在旧社会，像我们这样的人家，洗刷一般都在昏暗的厨房里，厨房后面是潮湿、散发着恶臭的洼地。而我们那片洼地那儿有个煤窑，这就使原本就凹凸不平的路上布满了黑色的煤炭粒，因此与别的洗刷地方比起来，我们这儿更是脏臭不堪了。"
"It was the region of “washing-up,” that greasy, damp function that followed every meal; its atmosphere had ever a cooling steaminess and the memory of boiled cabbage, and the sooty black stains where saucepan or kettle had been put down for a minute, scraps of potato-peel caught by the strainer of the escape-pipe, and rags of a quite indescribable horribleness of acquisition, called “dish-clouts,” rise in my memory at the name.","每次饭后我们就是在这样的“洗涮区”清洗碗碟的。在我的印象中，它始终是充满水汽的。空气中散发着水煮白菜的味道，平底锅和水壶碰到的地方都留下了黑色的印渍，下水道的滤网常被土豆皮堵上，所谓的“洗碗布”也不过是一块块脏得没法看的破布。"
"The altar of this place was the “sink,” a tank of stone, revolting to a refined touch, grease-filmed and unpleasant to see, and above this was a tap for cold water, so arranged that when the water descended it splashed and wetted whoever had turned it on.","这儿的神台就是那个“水槽”，是用石头砌成的，油腻不堪，令人作呕。“水槽”上面是个冷水龙头，一打开就水花四溅。"
"This tap was our water supply.","这个水龙头就是供应我们的水源。"
"And in such a place you must fancy a little old woman, rather incompetent and very gentle, a soul of unselfishness and sacrifice, in dirty clothes, all come from their original colors to a common dusty dark gray, in worn, ill-fitting boots, with hands distorted by ill use, and untidy graying hair—my mother.","你们可以想象一下，就是在这样一个地方，一位弱小却无私的老妇人，行动不便，穿着破旧的衣服和不合脚的鞋，手指因常干粗活而弯曲变形，头发花白且不整洁，她就是我的母亲。"
"In the winter her hands would be “chapped,” and she would have a cough.","冬天她会有季节性的咳嗽，手也会干裂。"
"And while she washes up I go out, to sell my overcoat and watch in order that I may desert her.","而我却趁她洗碗的时候溜出去当掉我的大衣和手表，以便我可以伺机离开她。"
"I gave way to queer hesitations in pawning my two negotiable articles.","去典当这两件东西的时候，我始终是犹豫不决的。"
"A weakly indisposition to pawn in Clayton, where the pawnbroker knew me, carried me to the door of the place in Lynch Street, Swathinglea, where I had bought my revolver.","我不太想在克莱顿当铺典当，因为那个老板是个熟人。典当过后他把我带到我曾买过手枪的斯沃星利的林奇街道。"
"Then came an idea that I was giving too many facts about myself to one man, and I came back to Clayton after all.","我那时有些后悔，觉得不该告诉他那么多关于我自己的事，可我终究还是回了克莱顿。"
"I forget how much money I got, but I remember that it was rather less than the sum I had made out to be the single fare to Shaphambury.","我忘了一共当了多少钱，只记得拿到的钱远不够我计划去香普汉贝的单程票。"
"Still deliberate, I went back to the Public Library to find out whether it was possible, by walking for ten or twelve miles anywhere, to shorten the journey.","于是我只得回到公共图书馆想办法，想着能不能步行10或12公里，缩短乘车路程。"
"My boots were in a dreadful state, the sole of the left one also was now peeling off, and I could not help perceiving that all my plans might be wrecked if at this crisis I went on shoe leather in which I could only shuffle.","而当时我的靴子已经破烂不堪了，左脚的鞋底就要掉下来了。我隐约想到，若是这只破靴子关键时刻掉链子，让我拖着走的话，我的计划估计要泡汤了。"
"So long as I went softly they would serve, but not for hard walking.","但只要我走得轻一点，估计还是能撑一阵子的，不过前提是不能走太远太快。"
"I went to the shoemaker in Hacker Street, but he would not promise any repairs for me under forty-eight hours.","我走进哈克街的一家修鞋铺，可鞋匠却说48小时之内不可能把我的鞋修好。"
"I got back home about five minutes to three, resolved to start by the five train for Birmingham in any case, but still dissatisfied about my money.","我回到家的时候已经是差五分钟三点，而我决定无论怎样我都要坐五点的车去伯明翰，可钱依然是个大问题。"
"I thought of pawning a book or something of that sort, but I could think of nothing of obvious value in the house.","我本想当掉一本书或是其他之类的东西，可我实在想不出家里还有什么值得等当的。"
"My mother’s silver—two gravy-spoons and a salt-cellar—had been pawned for some weeks, since, in fact, the June quarter day.","母亲的银器——两把汤匙和一个盐罐——在几周之前，准确地说，在6月15号就被当掉了。"
"But my mind was full of hypothetical opportunities.","但我的脑中依然还是充斥着无数种假设。"
"As I came up the steps to our door, I remarked that Mr. Gabbitas looked at me suddenly round his dull red curtains with a sort of alarmed resolution in his eye and vanished, and as I walked along the passage he opened his door upon me suddenly and intercepted me.","而当我准备上楼进屋时，却突然看到了加比塔斯先生，他站在红色的窗帘边望着我，眼神中闪过一丝惊讶，却很快就消失了。但当我走过走廊时，他却突然开门拦下了我。"
"You are figuring me, I hope, as a dark and sullen lout in shabby, cheap, old-world clothes that are shiny at all the wearing surfaces, and with a discolored red tie and frayed linen.","我希望你们能在脑中勾勒出我当时的样子：黑不溜秋，闷闷不乐，穿着不入时、廉价而破烂的衣服，系着褪色的红色领带，简直就像个小丑。"
"My left hand keeps in my pocket as though there is something it prefers to keep a grip upon there.","我左手一直插在口袋里，似乎里面有什么值得抓着的东西一样。"
"Mr. Gabbitas was shorter than I, and the first note he struck in the impression he made upon any one was of something bright and birdlike.","加比塔斯先生比我矮一些，给任何人的第一印象就是像只鸟儿一样轻快。"
"I think he wanted to be birdlike, he possessed the possibility of an avian charm, but, as a matter of fact, there was nothing of the glowing vitality of the bird in his being.","而我想他也不过是想效仿鸟儿的样子，他有能力使自己像鸟儿一样迷人，可他压根儿就没有鸟儿的那种热情活力。"
"And a bird is never out of breath and with an open mouth.","鸟儿是永远不会张着嘴，也不会气喘吁吁的。"
"He was in the clerical dress of that time, that costume that seems now almost the strangest of all our old-world clothing, and he presented it in its cheapest form—black of a poor texture, ill-fitting, strangely cut.","那时他穿着牧师服，现在看来那算得上是旧式服装里最奇怪的款式了。而他穿的又是最廉价的那款——黑色，布料极差，极不合身，而且剪裁很奇怪。"
"Its long skirts accentuated the tubbiness of his body, the shortness of his legs.","衣服下摆很宽，愈发映衬出他发福的身材，两条腿也显得特别短。"
"The white tie below his all-round collar, beneath his innocent large-spectacled face, was a little grubby, and between his not very clean teeth he held a briar pipe.","他穿着圆领衬衣，系着一条皱巴巴的白色领带，看似无辜的脸上架着一副大眼镜。算不上干净的牙齿间架着一支欧石楠烟斗。"
"His complexion was whitish, and although he was only thirty-three or four perhaps, his sandy hair was already thinning from the top of his head.","他肤色白皙，尽管不过三十三、四岁，却已经有谢顶的迹象了。"
"To your eye, now, he would seem the strangest figure, in the utter disregard of all physical beauty or dignity about him.","且不讲他的体型美或是尊严，放到现在，你可能会觉得那是个奇怪的形象。"
"You would find him extraordinarily odd, but in the old days he met not only with acceptance but respect.","你可能会觉得他极其古怪，但在当时，人们不仅接受了他的形象，还相当尊敬他。"
"He was alive until within a year or so ago, but his later appearance changed.","一年前左右，他依然健在，不过形象已经大变了。"
"As I saw him that afternoon he was a very slovenly, ungainly little human being indeed, not only was his clothing altogether ugly and queer, but had you stripped the man stark, you would certainly have seen in the bulging paunch that comes from flabby muscles and flabbily controlled appetites, and in the rounded shoulders and flawed and yellowish skin, the same failure of any effort toward clean beauty.","那天下午我看到他时，他确实是个邋里邋遢、不修边幅、个子矮小的人。他不仅穿着古怪丑陋，而且就算脱去外衣，你也定会看到他大腹便便（这是暴饮暴食的结果）、肌肉松弛、肩膀浑圆、皮肤皲裂、污浊邋遢、脸色发黄，似乎没什么能将他收拾得整洁一点。"
"You had an instinctive sense that so he had been from the beginning.","你会本能地觉得他一向就是这个样子。"
"You felt he was not only drifting through life, eating what came in his way, believing what came in his way, doing without any vigor what came in his way, but that into life also he had drifted.","他有什么吃什么，见到什么都相信什么，什么事儿来了就随便地应付过去。你会觉得他不仅在生活中随遇而安，而且他还真的混进生活中去了。"
"You could not believe him the child of pride and high resolve, or of any splendid passion of love.","你简直无法相信他曾是一个自尊心强、意志坚定或是心中充满无限的爱的孩子。"
"He had just HAPPENED... But we all happened then.","可他过去就是这样的……过去的我们都是这样的。"
"Why am I taking this tone over this poor little curate in particular?","我为什么要用这样的口气来特别描述这位可怜的小个子牧师呢？"
"“Hello!”","“嗨！”"
"he said, with an assumption of friendly ease.","他装出一副友好而闲适的样子跟我说，"
"“Haven’t seen you for weeks!","“好几周都没看到你了！"
"Come in and have a gossip.”","进来聊聊吧。”"
"An invitation from the drawing-room lodger was in the nature of a command.","房东的邀请事实上就是一种命令。"
"I would have liked very greatly to have refused it, never was invitation more inopportune, but I had not the wit to think of an excuse.","我其实是很想拒绝的，因为这邀请实在太不是时候了，但我一时间又找不到什么借口。"
"“All right,” I said awkwardly, and he held the door open for me.","“好吧，”我有些笨拙地回答说，而后他开门让我进去。"
"“I’d be very glad if you would,” he amplified.","“很高兴你能接受我的邀请。”他大声说，"
"“One doesn’t get much opportunity of intelligent talk in this parish.”","“在这个教区很少能找到这么好的聊天机会。”"
"What the devil was he up to, was my secret preoccupation.","我暗自一直在思忖：这家伙到底想干什么呢？"
"He fussed about me with a nervous hospitality, talking in jumpy fragments, rubbing his hands together, and taking peeps at me over and round his glasses.","他对我大献殷勤，十分紧张，东一句西一句地讲着，两手来回摩挲着，并不时地透过眼镜偷偷瞄着我的表情。"
"As I sat down in his leather-covered armchair, I had an odd memory of the one in the Clayton dentist’s operating-room—I know not why.","当我坐在他的皮面扶手椅上的时候，一个古怪的想法突然冒了出来，我想起了克莱顿牙科手术室的患者——我也搞不清楚我为什么会有这种想法。"
"“They’re going to give us trouble in the North Sea, it seems,” he remarked with a sort of innocent zest.","“看来他们要在北海给我们找点麻烦了。”他带着一种天真的兴奋的情绪说道，"
"“I’m glad they mean fighting.”","“很高兴他们要开战了。”"
"There was an air of culture about his room that always cowed me, and that made me constrained even on this occasion.","这个房间的文化氛围常让我产生畏缩感，而这种场合甚至让我颇有压迫感。"
"The table under the window was littered with photographic material and the later albums of his continental souvenirs, and on the American cloth trimmed shelves that filled the recesses on either side of the fireplace were what I used to think in those days a quite incredible number of books—perhaps eight hundred altogether, including the reverend gentleman’s photograph albums and college and school text-books.","房间的窗户下放着一张桌子，上面乱七八糟地摆着一些摄影器材和一些近期在欧洲拍的纪念照。美国台布镶边的书架塞在壁炉两边的壁龛处，我曾觉得上面摆着很多书——大概有八百多本，包括这位令人尊敬的绅士的相册和一些大学教材。"
"This suggestion of learning was enforced by the little wooden shield bearing a college coat-of-arms that hung over the looking-glass, and by a photograph of Mr. Gabbitas in cap and gown in an Oxford frame that adorned the opposite wall.","对面的墙上有一个小木框挂在镜子上方，里面嵌着一块小的盾形大学徽章和加比塔斯先生的照片。照片上的他戴着学位帽、身穿长袍，配以牛津大学为背景。这样的摆设更加显示出了房间主人的博闻广识。"
"And in the middle of that wall stood his writing-desk, which I knew to have pigeon-holes when it was open, and which made him seem not merely cultured but literary.","墙正中摆着他的写字台，据我所知打开之后还有小的间隔，这使得他看起来不仅受过教育且精通文学。"
"At that he wrote sermons, composing them himself!","他曾自己写过布道词，而亲自谱了曲！"
"“Yes,” he said, taking possession of the hearthrug, “the war had to come sooner or later.","“没错，”他边说边走到壁炉前的地毯上，“战争早晚会来的。"
"If we smash their fleet for them now; well, there’s an end to the matter!”","如果我们现在就能摧毁他们的军舰，那么战争就结束了！”"
"He stood on his toes and then bumped down on his heels, and looked blandly through his spectacles at a water-color by his sister—the subject was a bunch of violets—above the sideboard which was his pantry and tea-chest and cellar.","他踮起脚尖站着，但却一不小心失去了重心，摔倒在地。他透过眼镜，呆呆地看着她妹妹的一幅水彩画——主题是一束紫罗兰——这幅画就放在放着他的食物和茶叶的餐具柜上。"
"“Yes,” he said as he did so.","“就是这样。”他边看边说。"
"I coughed, and wondered how I might presently get away.","我咳嗽了一声，盘算着应该怎么离开那儿。"
"He invited me to smoke—that queer old practice!","他请我吸烟——多么古旧而奇特的习惯！"
"—and then when I declined, began talking in a confidential tone of this “dreadful business” of the strikes.","我谢绝了，他则紧接着神秘兮兮地跟我谈起“可怕的大罢工”。"
"“The war won’t improve THAT outlook,” he said, and was very grave for a moment.","“战争不会改变他们的前景。”他说，一时间面色凝重。"
"He spoke of the want of thought for their wives and children shown by the colliers in striking merely for the sake of the union, and this stirred me to controversy, and distracted me a little from my resolution to escape.","他说矿工们罢工提及他们是为了他们的妻儿着想，而他们只是鉴于公会的原因而这样说的，这激起了我的抗议，也稍稍转移了我想逃离开的想法。"
"“I don’t quite agree with that,” I said, clearing my throat.","“我不同意你这种讲法。”我清了清喉咙说，"
"“If the men didn’t strike for the union now, if they let that be broken up, where would they be when the pinch of reductions did come?”","“如果现在这些人不为工会罢工，如果他们任由工会被解散，那么当真到降薪的时候，他们又能去哪儿？”"
"To which he replied that they couldn’t expect to get top-price wages when the masters were selling bottom-price coal.","对此他回复说，当雇主低价出售煤矿时，矿工的薪水是无法达到最高水平的。"
"I replied, “That isn’t it.","我回答说，“原因不在这里。"
"The masters don’t treat them fairly.","雇主对待他们根本不公平。"
"They have to protect themselves.”","他们必须发起自卫。”"
"To which Mr. Gabbitas answered, “Well, I don’t know.","而加比塔斯先生则说：“恩，这个我不清楚。"
"I’ve been in the Four Towns some time, and I must say I don’t think the balance of injustice falls on the masters’ side.”","我在四镇住过一段时间，而我不得不说，我并不觉得不公平的天平偏向了雇主那一边。”"
"“It falls on the men,” I agreed, wilfully misunderstanding him.","“不公平的天平是偏向矿工那一边的。”我故意歪曲了他的意思附和道。"
"And so we worked our way toward an argument.","我们就这样争论着。"
"“Confound this argument!”","“混淆观点！”"
"I thought; but I had no skill in self-extraction, and my irritation crept into my voice.","我这样想着，但却不知道该怎样自我抽离，因而口气中不免多了烦躁。"
"Three little spots of color came into the cheeks and nose of Mr. Gabbitas, but his voice showed nothing of his ruffled temper.","加比塔斯先生也是辩论得面红耳赤，但他的声音中并没有被激怒的感觉。"
"“You see,” I said, “I’m a socialist.","“这么跟你说吧，”我说，“我是个社会主义者。"
"I don’t think this world was made for a small minority to dance on the faces of every one else.”","我觉得这个世界不应为了少数人而存在，不能任由他们在世人面前耀武扬威。”"
"“My dear fellow,” said the Rev.","“我亲爱的朋友，”牧师说道，"
"Gabbitas, “I’M a socialist too.","“我也是个社会主义者。"
"Who isn’t.","谁不是呢。"
"But that doesn’t lead me to class hatred.”","但社会主义者并不一定要产生阶级仇恨。”"
"“You haven’t felt the heel of this confounded system.","“那是因为你尚未领悟到这含混的制度的本质。"
"I have.”","而我已经领悟到了。”"
"“Ah!”","“噢！”"
"said he; and catching him on that note came a rap at the front door, and, as he hung suspended, the sound of my mother letting some one in and a timid rap.","他说，话音刚落，前门便传来了敲门声，他没再说下去。我听见我的母亲正在请什么人进来，紧接着是一声胆怯的敲门声。"
"“NOW,” thought I, and stood up, resolutely, but he would not let me.","“现在不走，更待何时。”我这样想着，坚定地站起身来，可他却不让我离开。"
"“No, no, no!”","“别，别走，别走！”"
"said he.","他说，"
"“It’s only for the Dorcas money.”","“那不过是来要多卡斯的钱的。”"
"He put his hand against my chest with an effect of physical compulsion, and cried, “Come in!”","他抬起手，挡在我的胸前，强留我坐下，而后大声喊道：“进来！”"
"“Our talk’s just getting interesting,” he protested; and there entered Miss Ramell, an elderly little young lady who was mighty in Church help in Clayton.","“我们正谈得起劲呢！”他对来访者表示出极大的不满。进来的是雷米尔小姐，那是位身材娇小的女士，年龄已经不小了，在克莱顿教区是一位活跃的很有本事的人物。"
"He greeted her—she took no notice of me—and went to his bureau, and I remained standing by my chair but unable to get out of the room.","加比塔斯先生跟她打了声招呼，她没有注意到我，便直接走到加比塔斯先生的书桌旁，我依然站在椅子旁边，不太方便离开。"
"“I’m not interrupting?”","“没打扰到你们吧？”"
"asked Miss Ramell.","雷米尔小姐问。"
"“Not in the least,” he said; drew out the carriers and opened his desk.","“哪儿会呢，”他边说便拿出文件，打开书桌。"
"I could not help seeing what he did.","我禁不住想看看他要做什么。"
"I was so fretted by my impotence to leave him that at the moment it did not connect at all with the research of the morning that he was taking out money.","我并没有特别后悔当时没有离开，他们的谈话内容和刚才他所说的收钱没什么关系。"
"I listened sullenly to his talk with Miss Ramell, and saw only, as they say in Wales, with the front of my eyes, the small flat drawer that had, it seemed, quite a number of sovereigns scattered over its floor.","我阴着脸听着他与雷米尔小姐讲话，准确地说，是看他们俩讲话，因为他们讲的是威尔士语。我看到在我面前的一个平抽屉里似乎散放着不少硬币。"
"“They’re so unreasonable,” complained Miss Ramell.","“他们真是不可理喻，”雷米尔小姐抱怨道，"
"Who could be otherwise in a social organization that bordered on insanity?","“又有谁会去参加这么一个几乎疯狂的社会组织呢？”"
"I turned away from them, put my foot on the fender, stuck my elbow on the plush-fringed mantelboard, and studied the photographs, pipes, and ash-trays that adorned it.","我没再理会他们说些什么，转身把脚放在壁炉的栏杆上，胳膊肘抵着满是绒毛边的金属板，仔细看着房间里的照片、烟斗以及烟灰缸。"
"What was it I had to think out before I went to the station?","在去火车站前还有什么需要考虑清楚？"
"Of course!","当然有！"
"My mind made a queer little reluctant leap—it felt like being forced to leap over a bottomless chasm—and alighted upon the sovereigns that were just disappearing again as Mr. Gabbitas shut his drawer.","我的思维不情愿地轻轻跃了一下——似乎是被迫越过了一个无底深渊——而后落到了这些硬币上。加比塔斯先生关上了抽屉，硬币也就从我眼前消失了。"
"“I won’t interrupt your talk further,” said Miss Ramell, receding doorward.","“我就不再耽误你们聊天了。”雷米尔小姐走出了门。"
"Mr. Gabbitas played round her politely, and opened the door for her and conducted her into the passage, and for a moment or so I had the fullest sense of proximity to those—it seemed to me there must be ten or twelve—sovereigns....","加比塔斯先生礼貌地将她送到门口，为她打开门，把她送出过道。有那么一段时间，我脑中想的全是钱，抽屉里大概有十个或是十二个硬币……"
"The front door closed and he returned.","而前门关了，他回来了。"
"My chance of escape had gone.","我溜走的机会也一去不回了。"
"Section 4","第四节"
"“I MUST be going,” I said, with a curiously reinforced desire to get away out of that room.","“我必须得走了。”我说，我迫切地想逃离那个房间。"
"“My dear chap!”","“我亲爱的伙计！”"
"he insisted, “I can’t think of it.","他坚持说，“我真想不到你这么快就要走。"
"Surely—there’s nothing to call you away.”","真的，你又没有什么事儿。”"
"Then with an evident desire to shift the venue of our talk, he asked, “You never told me what you thought of Burble’s little book.”","继而他开始明显地转移话题说，“你还没告诉我你对伯布那本书有什么看法。”"
"I was now, beneath my dull display of submission, furiously angry with him.","当下，我虽然表面上很顺从他的样子，内心却十分生气。"
"It occurred to me to ask myself why I should defer and qualify my opinions to him.","我开始问自己为什么老是服从或向他证明我的观点呢。"
"Why should I pretend a feeling of intellectual and social inferiority toward him.","为什么我要在他面前装成一副知识没他渊博、社会地位没他高的样子呢？"
"He asked what I thought of Burble.","他既然问我对伯布有什么看法，"
"I resolved to tell him—if necessary with arrogance.","那我就告诉他好了——必要时要摆出一副傲慢的样子，"
"Then perhaps he would release me.","也许这样他就会让我离开了。"
"I did not sit down again, but stood by the corner of the fireplace.","我没有再坐下，而是站在壁炉的一旁。"
"“That was the little book you lent me last summer?”","“你是说你去年夏天借给我的那本书么？”"
"I said.","我问道。"
"“He reasons closely, eh?”","“他的论证相当缜密，不是么？”"
"he said, and indicated the armchair with a flat hand, and beamed persuasively.","他一边说，一边用他只胖手示意我坐下。"
"I remained standing.","而我却依然站着，"
"“I didn’t think much of his reasoning powers,” I said.","“我没觉得他的论述多有说服力。”我说道。"
"“He was one of the cleverest bishops London ever had.”","“他是伦敦最具智慧的主教之一。”"
"“That may be.","“可能吧。"
"But he was dodging about in a jolly feeble case,” said I.","不过他在一件小事上却含糊其辞。”我说。"
"“You mean?”","“你指的是？”"
"“That he’s wrong.","“他的分析是错的。"
"I don’t think he proves his case.","我觉得他没能证明自己的观点。"
"I don’t think Christianity is true.","我觉得基督教本身就是骗人的。"
"He knows himself for the pretender he is.","他知道自己不过是个冒充者。"
"His reasoning’s—Rot.”","他的逻辑推理简直就是荒谬。”"
"Mr. Gabbitas went, I think, a shade paler than his wont, and propitiation vanished from his manner.","我想，加比塔斯先生的脸色比往常更加苍白了，神情也不似之前那般和善。"
"His eyes and mouth were round, his face seemed to get round, his eyebrows curved at my remarks.","他瞠目结舌，面容有些扭曲，眉头深锁。"
"“I’m sorry you think that,” he said at last, with a catch in his breath.","“你那样想，我很遗憾。”他最后深吸了一口气，开口说。"
"He did not repeat his suggestion that I should sit.","他没有再示意我坐下。"
"He made a step or two toward the window and turned.","他向窗口走了一两步，继而转过身说。"
"“I suppose you will admit—” he began, with a faintly irritating note of intellectual condescension.....","“我想你应该承认——”他说，语气中带着些许怒气和知识分子的清高……"
"I will not tell you of his arguments or mine.","在这里，我就不用告诉你他的或是我的论述。"
"You will find if you care to look for them, in out-of-the-way corners of our book museums, the shriveled cheap publications—the publications of the Rationalist Press Association, for example—on which my arguments were based.","如果你感兴趣的话，你可以去书库里找那些书来读，那些书都已经是皱巴巴的了，存放在现已鲜有人问津的书库里，价钱很便宜。我的论点就是来源于理性者联合出版社的那些书。"
"Lying in that curious limbo with them, mixed up with them and indistinguishable, are the endless “Replies” of orthodoxy, like the mixed dead in some hard-fought trench.","那些书中的观点处于一种中间状态，混淆、模糊了正统学中无穷尽的“答复”，就像战场上无法辨认的血肉模糊的死者尸体一样。"
"All those disputes of our fathers, and they were sometimes furious disputes, have gone now beyond the range of comprehension.","那些都是关于我们前辈的争论，那争论激烈的程度有时完全超过了我们的认知范围。"
"You younger people, I know, read them with impatient perplexity.","我知道年轻人很难读懂那些书，也没什么耐心读下去。"
"You cannot understand how sane creatures could imagine they had joined issue at all in most of these controversies.","你无法理解那时的人们将参与最具争议性问题的辩论看得多么神圣。"
"All the old methods of systematic thinking, the queer absurdities of the Aristotelian logic, have followed magic numbers and mystical numbers, and the Rumpelstiltskin magic of names now into the blackness of the unthinkable.","一切条理清晰的旧思维方式和亚里士多德的逻辑理论都伴随着神奇而神秘的数字和神秘的名字进入了不可捉摸的神秘黑暗领地。"
"You can no more understand our theological passions than you can understand the fancies that made all ancient peoples speak of their gods only by circumlocutions, that made savages pine away and die because they had been photographed, or an Elizabethan farmer turn back from a day’s expedition because he had met three crows.","你无法想象我们对宗教的狂热，也无法明白为什么过去的人谈起上帝时总喜欢用委婉语，更无法理解为什么野人被拍照后会死去，或者为什么伊丽莎白时代的农夫如果一天之内看到三只乌鸦就会打消出门远行的念头。"
"Even I, who have been through it all, recall our controversies now with something near incredulity.","就算我这个过来人，现在回想起这些争议时也是颇为不解的。"
"Faith we can understand to-day, all men live by faith, but in the old time every one confused quite hopelessly Faith and a forced, incredible Belief in certain pseudo-concrete statements.","现在，我们可以理解信念，人是靠信念支撑而活下去的。但在以前，人们都绝望地拒绝了信念，拒绝强加的、难易置信的抽象信念。"
"I am inclined to say that neither believers nor unbelievers had faith as we understand it—they had insufficient intellectual power.","而我想说的是，信或不信，人们都有我们理解中的信念——然而他们没有丰富的学识。"
"They could not trust unless they had something to see and touch and say, like their barbarous ancestors who could not make a bargain without exchange of tokens.","他们无法相信除了亲眼看到或者亲手触摸过的信念，就像我们的先祖看不到交换货币就不会做物物交换一样。"
"If they no longer worshipped stocks and stones, or eked out their needs with pilgrimages and images, they still held fiercely to audible images, to printed words and formulae.","即使他们不再有动物或石物崇拜，或不再需要节衣缩食地供奉、朝拜神像，他们也有始终坚守那些可见形象、戒律和清规。"
"But why revive the echoes of the ancient logomachies?","可为什么一定要回到古代争论呢？"
"Suffice it that we lost our tempers very readily in pursuit of God and Truth, and said exquisitely foolish things on either side.","这足以让我们在追随上帝和真理的过程中怒气冲天，辩论双方都扔出一些愚蠢至极的话来。"
"And on the whole—from the impartial perspective of my three and seventy years—I adjudicate that if my dialectic was bad, that of the Rev.","总体上讲——我现在可以以73岁的年龄公正地判定，如果说当时我的辩论技术十分拙劣的话，"
"Gabbitas was altogether worse.","那么加比塔斯的就更糟糕了。"
"Little pink spots came into his cheeks, a squealing note into his voice.","他那时满脸通红，雀斑更加明显，他甚至尖声叫了起来。"
"We interrupted each other more and more rudely.","我们愈发粗鲁地打断对方的话。"
"We invented facts and appealed to authorities whose names I mispronounced; and, finding Gabbitas shy of the higher criticism and the Germans, I used the names of Karl Marx and Engels as Bible exegetes with no little effect.","我们不断地引经据典甚至杜撰事实。我还说错了一些权威人士的名字。当我发觉加比塔斯对更高深的评论和德国人所知甚少时，我便提起了德国的卡尔·马克思和恩格斯，说他们是《圣经》的评注家，却没有引来任何争议。"
"A silly wrangle!","这是一场多么愚蠢的争论！"
"a preposterous wrangle!—you must imagine our talk becoming louder, with a developing quarrelsome note—my mother no doubt hovering on the staircase and listening in alarm as who should say, “My dear, don’t offend it!","可笑至极！你一定能想象到，我们的声音越来越大，越来越像吵架——我的母亲那时一定正在楼梯口不提徘徊，惊慌地听着我们之间的争论，心里默念着：“我亲爱的，别那么冲动！"
"Oh, don’t offend it!","噢，别那么冲动！"
"Mr. Gabbitas enjoys its friendship.","加比塔斯先生是喜欢交朋友的。"
"Try to think whatever Mr. Gabbitas says”—though we still kept in touch with a pretence of mutual deference.","认真考虑下他说的话吧。”——而我们在表面上依然对彼此表示尊重。"
"The ethical superiority of Christianity to all other religions came to the fore—I know not how.","基督精神之于其他教义的道德优势在这儿发挥出来了——但我不知道这是为什么。"
"We dealt with the matter in bold, imaginative generalizations, because of the insufficiency of our historical knowledge.","介于历史知识的匮乏，我们对那次争论做了个冒失的、假设性质的总结。"
"I was moved to denounce Christianity as the ethic of slaves, and declare myself a disciple of a German writer of no little vogue in those days, named Nietzsche.","我继而谴责基督教义是奴隶的道德，并坚定地宣称自己是当时德国名作家尼采的门徒。"
"For a disciple I must confess I was particularly ill acquainted with the works of the master.","而作为一位门徒，我不得不坦白地承认我并不十分了解这位大师的作品。"
"Indeed, all I knew of him had come to me through a two-column article in The Clarion for the previous week....","事实上，我是在前一周，在《号角》杂志上他的一篇占了两栏的文章才开始知道他的……"
"But the Rev. Gabbitas did not read The Clarion.","但是加比塔斯牧师从未读过这本杂志。"
"I am, I know, putting a strain upon your credulity when I tell you that I now have little doubt that the Rev.","现在如果我告诉你，加比塔斯对尼采一无所知，你肯定不会轻易相信的。"
"Gabbitas was absolutely ignorant even of the name of Nietzsche, although that writer presented a separate and distinct attitude of attack upon the faith that was in the reverend gentleman’s keeping.","而加比塔斯甚至连尼采的名字都没听说过，尽管他的藏书中就有那些关于攻击尼采信仰的书。"
"“I’m a disciple of Nietzsche,” said I, with an air of extensive explanation.","“我是尼采的门徒。”我带着一副准备进一步解释的神情说道。"
"He shied away so awkwardly at the name that I repeated it at once.","他听到这个名字就有些笨拙地畏缩了，于是我立刻重复了一遍。"
"“But do you know what Nietzsche says?”","“不过你知道尼采都说了些什么吗？”"
"I pressed him viciously.","我恶意挑衅着。"
"“He has certainly been adequately answered,” said he, still trying to carry it off.","“他的理论一定曾被反驳。”他说，依旧避开我的问题。"
"“Who by?”","“被谁？”"
"I rapped out hotly.","我怒气上来了，"
"“Tell me that!”","“告诉我！”"
"and became mercilessly expectant.","我无情地逼问他说。"
"Section 5","第五节"
"A happy accident relieved Mr. Gabbitas from the embarrassment of that challenge, and carried me another step along my course of personal disaster.","正当加比塔斯先生焦灼应付我的挑衅之际，有人恰好赶到，帮他解了围，而这却加速了我个人灾难的来临。"
"It came on the heels of my question in the form of a clatter of horses without, and the gride and cessation of wheels.","正当加比塔斯先生被我问住的时候，一阵嘈杂的马车声传来，停在门前。"
"I glimpsed a straw-hatted coachman and a pair of grays.","我瞥到一位戴着草帽的车夫和两批灰马。"
"It seemed an incredibly magnificent carriage for Clayton.","在克莱顿能看到如此奢华的马车简直是太不可思议了。"
"“Eh!”","“啊！”"
"said the Rev. Gabbitas, going to the window.","加比塔斯牧师走到窗前说，"
"“Why, it’s old Mrs. Verrall!","“哦，是维罗尔老太太！"
"It’s old Mrs. Verrall.","是维罗尔老太太。"
"Really!","真的是她！"
"What CAN she want with me?”","她有什么需要我做的么？”"
"He turned to me, and the flush of controversy had passed and his face shone like the sun.","他转过身来看着我，因争论而涨红的脸恢复了平静，变得如阳光般灿烂。"
"It was not every day, I perceived, that Mrs. Verrall came to see him.","我由此看出，维罗尔太太并不是每天都来探望他的。"
"“I get so many interruptions,” he said, almost grinning.","“总是有人打断我们，”他笑嘻嘻地说，"
"“You must excuse me a minute!","“请你一定要原谅我要离开一分钟！"
"Then—then I’ll tell you about that fellow.","然后——然后我会回来跟你聊聊那个家伙。"
"But don’t go.","但不要走。"
"I pray you don’t go.","千万别走。"
"I can assure you....","我可以向你保证……"
"MOST interesting.”","绝对有意思。”"
"He went out of the room waving vague prohibitory gestures.","他走出房间，模糊地跟我做一个不要走的手势。"
"“I MUST go,” I cried after him.","“我不得不走了。”我在他身后喊道。"
"“No, no, no!”","“别，别走，别走！”"
"in the passage.","他的声音从走廊里传来，"
"“I’ve got your answer,” I think it was he added, and “quite mistaken;” and I saw him running down the steps to talk to the old lady.","“我算你答应了。”我想这是他后来加的，还说了一句“别误会”什么的，而后我看到他跑下台阶，和那位老太太讲话。"
"I swore.","我咒骂了一句。"
"I made three steps to the window, and this brought me within a yard of that accursed drawer.","我向着窗边走了三步，这样我离那该死的抽屉就只有一码远了。"
"I glanced at it, and then at that old woman who was so absolutely powerful, and instantly her son and Nettie’s face were flaming in my brain.","我瞥了那抽屉一眼，然后瞟了瞟那位有着绝对权势的老妇人，她儿子和妮蒂的脸在那一刻在我的脑海中燃烧起来。"
"The Stuarts had, no doubt, already accepted accomplished facts.","毋庸置疑，斯图亚特夫妇早已接受这一既定的事实。"
"And I too—","我也接受了——"
"What was I doing here?","那我还在这儿干什么？"
"What was I doing here while judgment escaped me?","既然他们的交易可以越过我达成，那我还杵在这儿干什么？"
"I woke up.","我恍然大悟。"
"I was injected with energy.","一时间我热血沸腾。"
"I took one reassuring look at the curate’s obsequious back, at the old lady’s projected nose and quivering hand, and then with swift, clean movements I had the little drawer open, four sovereigns in my pocket, and the drawer shut again.","为了再次确认他不会转过来，我再一次看了一眼牧师谄媚的背影和老太太的鹰钩鼻以及颤抖的手，而后迅速地打开了那个小抽屉，拿出四个硬币，装进我自己的口袋，关上抽屉。"
"Then again at the window—they were still talking.","接着我又瞥了一眼窗外——他们依然还在聊着。"
"That was all right.","一切顺利。"
"He might not look in that drawer for hours.","也许他几个小时里都不会打开抽屉。"
"I glanced at his clock.","我瞥了一眼他的钟。"
"Twenty minutes still before the Birmingham train.","离伯明翰火车离站还差二十分钟。"
"Time to buy a pair of boots and get away.","这时间够我买一双靴子然后离开。"
"But how I was to get to the station?","但我应该怎么去火车站呢？"
"I went out boldly into the passage, and took my hat and stick....","我壮着胆子到走廊拿过我的帽子和手杖……"
"Walk past him?","就直接从他身边走过去么？"
"Yes.","对。"
"That was all right!","就这么走过去！"
"He could not argue with me while so important a person engaged him....","有这么一个重要人物与他见面，他一定不会再挽留我什么了——"
"I came boldly down the steps.","我鼓起勇气走下楼。"
"“I want a list made, Mr. Gabbitas, of all the really DESERVING cases,” old Mrs. Verrall was saying.","“请给我列出清单，加比塔斯先生，写出每个人实际赢得的数目。”维罗尔老太太如是说。"
"It is curious, but it did not occur to me that here was a mother whose son I was going to kill.","我觉得有些怪，但还没有意识到，我要去杀的那个人正是这位母亲的儿子。"
"I did not see her in that aspect at all.","我完全没有向那个方向想她。"
"Instead, I was possessed by a realization of the blazing imbecility of a social system that gave this palsied old woman the power to give or withhold the urgent necessities of life from hundreds of her fellow-creatures just according to her poor, foolish old fancies of desert.","而我脑中当时想的仅仅是，这个社会的制度是多么荒谬，竟然让这么一位垂垂老矣的妇人拥有如此大的权利——她可以用她那愚昧而陈腐的奖罚观念，随意克扣或是给予无数为她工作的人的生活必需品。"
"“We could make a PROVISIONAL list of that sort,” he was saying, and glanced round with a preoccupied expression at me.","“我们可以先列一份临时的清单。”他说着瞥了我一眼，一副心事重重的样子。"
"“I MUST go,” I said at his flash of inquiry, and added, “I’ll be back in twenty minutes,” and went on my way.","“我必须走了，”我望着他询问的眼神补充说，“20分钟后回来。”说完我便离开了。"
"He turned again to his patroness as though he forgot me on the instant.","而他则继续跟她的女主人交谈，似乎片刻间便把我抛在脑后了。"
"Perhaps after all he was not sorry.","也许对于我的离开，他压根儿就没觉得遗憾过。"
"I felt extraordinarily cool and capable, exhilarated, if anything, by this prompt, effectual theft.","好像是因为这刺激而成功的偷窃，让我感觉异常冷静而有能力，同时又兴奋不已。"
"After all, my great determination would achieve itself.","毕竟，我就要兑现我的重大决定了。"
"I was no longer oppressed by a sense of obstacles, I felt I could grasp accidents and turn them to my advantage.","我不再觉得困难重重，而是认为我可以利用一系列的事故化为我的优势。"
"I would go now down Hacker Street to the little shoemaker’s—get a sound, good pair of boots—ten minutes—and then to the railway-station—five minutes more—and off!","我将先去哈克街的小鞋匠那儿买一双耐穿的好靴子——十分钟——然后去火车站——五分钟——而后就启程了！"
"I felt as efficient and non-moral as if I was Nietzsche’s Over-man already come.","我觉得自己就是尼采笔下的超人的化身，办事冷静而高效。"
"It did not occur to me that the curate’s clock might have a considerable margin of error.","但我却遗漏了一个事实——副牧师的钟可能不准。"
"Section 6","第六节"
"I missed the train.","我没赶上那班火车。"
"Partly that was because the curate’s clock was slow, and partly it was due to the commercial obstinacy of the shoemaker, who would try on another pair after I had declared my time was up.","这部分归咎于牧师家的钟慢了，同时也因为那鞋匠可恶的商业劣根性，我早跟他说过我在赶时间，可他却接了其他生意。"
"I bought the final pair however, gave him a wrong address for the return of the old ones, and only ceased to feel like the Nietzschean Over-man, when I saw the train running out of the station.","而我还是买了他的最后一双靴子，给了他一个家地址，以防他要还我的旧靴子。在我看到列车出站的那一刻，我那感觉自己是尼采笔下的超人的幻想终于破灭了。"
"Even then I did not lose my head.","但我仍旧没有失去理智。"
"It occurred to me almost at once that, in the event of a prompt pursuit, there would be a great advantage in not taking a train from Clayton; that, indeed, to have done so would have been an error from which only luck had saved me.","我几乎在同时想到，如果警察要追踪我，那么没赶上从克莱顿出发的那班车对我来说也可能是因祸得福。事实上，我要是真的上了那班车才会酿成真正的大错，到时候命运如何就只能靠运气眷顾了。"
"As it was, I had already been very indiscreet in my inquiries about Shaphambury; for once on the scent the clerk could not fail to remember me.","因为我在大厅询问有关香普汉贝里的信息时十分不谨慎，一旦警察掌握了线索问起那个小职员，他一定不会不记得我。"
"Now the chances were against his coming into the case.","不过现在，我既然没赶上那班车，他就不会被卷进这件案子了。"
"I did not go into the station therefore at all, I made no demonstration of having missed the train, but walked quietly past, down the road, crossed the iron footbridge, and took the way back circuitously by White’s brickfields and the allotments to the way over Clayton Crest to Two-Mile Stone, where I calculated I should have an ample margin for the 6.13 train.","我并没有走进车站，也没有表现出错过火车的神情，而是平静地从车站旁走了过去，穿过铁桥，绕过怀特砖厂和配给站，而后经由克莱顿峰顶前往二里石镇。我估摸着，在那儿我应该能有足够的时间赶上六点十三分的火车。"
"I was not very greatly excited or alarmed then.","我那时没有特别激动，也没有特别紧张。"
"Suppose, I reasoned, that by some accident the curate goes to that drawer at once: will he be certain to miss four out of ten or eleven sovereigns?","我假设着，如果牧师当时因为什么原因立刻打开了抽屉，他会不会发觉十或十一个硬币中少了四个？"
"If he does, will he at once think I have taken them?","如果他真的发现了，他会不会立刻怀疑到我？"
"If he does, will he act at once or wait for my return?","如果他怀疑到我了，他是会立刻采取行动呢还是会等我回去呢？"
"If he acts at once, will he talk to my mother or call in the police?","如果他采取行动了，是会告诉我母亲呢还是会报警呢？"
"Then there are a dozen roads and even railways out of the Clayton region, how is he to know which I have taken?","克莱顿通向外面的公路和铁路干线共有十几条，他怎么可能猜到我走哪一条呢？"
"Suppose he goes straight at once to the right station, they will not remember my departure for the simple reason that I didn’t depart.","就算他碰巧直接去了我去过的车站，他们也不会记得我离开这事儿，因为我根本就没走。"
"But they may remember about Shaphambury?","但他们会不会记得香普汉贝里呢？"
"It was unlikely.","应该也不会吧。"
"I resolved not to go directly to Shaphambury from Birmingham, but to go thence to Monkshampton, thence to Wyvern, and then come down on Shaphambury from the north.","我决定不直接去香普汉贝里，而是先去蒙克香普顿，然后转车至威弗恩，最后再南下去香普汉贝里。"
"That might involve a night at some intermediate stopping-place but it would effectually conceal me from any but the most persistent pursuit.","这样走可能会在中途某个站延迟一晚上，但可以有效地掩盖我的真实目的了。"
"And this was not a case of murder yet, but only the theft of four sovereigns.","而且这根本不是什么谋杀案，而不过是抓个偷了四个硬币的小偷而已。"
"I had argued away all anxiety before I reached Clayton Crest.","还没到克莱顿峰顶，我就打消了所有顾虑。"
"At the Crest I looked back.","到达峰顶的时候，我回望了一下。"
"What a world it was!","这是怎样一个世界啊！"
"And suddenly it came to me that I was looking at this world for the last time.","那一刻，我突然感觉那将是我最后一次凝望这个世界了。"
"If I overtook the fugitives and succeeded, I should die with them—or hang.","如果我能够碰上那两个私奔的人，并且得手，我会与他们同归于尽——或者被绞死。"
"I stopped and looked back more attentively at that wide ugly valley.","我停下脚步，再一次深情地望向那块空旷而不堪的山谷。"
"It was my native valley, and I was going out of it, I thought never to return, and yet in that last prospect, the group of towns that had borne me and dwarfed and crippled and made me, seemed, in some indefinable manner, strange.","那是我的出生地，而我就要离开它，一去不回了。而在那最后一次凝望中，我突然觉得，那片生我养我并成就了今日的我的村落，却不知为什么变得陌生了。"
"I was, perhaps, more used to seeing it from this comprehensive view-point when it was veiled and softened by night; now it came out in all its weekday reek, under a clear afternoon sun.","我想也许是我更习惯看它在夜色笼罩下显现出的那种蒙眬而平和的感觉吧，而此刻在午后的艳阳中，它的轮廓从平日的雾气中跳出来，显得愈发清晰。"
"That may account a little for its unfamiliarity.","也许正是因为这样我才觉得它陌生吧。"
"And perhaps, too, there was something in the emotions through which I had been passing for a week and more, to intensify my insight, to enable me to pierce the unusual, to question the accepted.","抑或是这一周多时间以来，我的心绪有了些微妙的变化，我的洞察力更为深刻，从而得以质疑那些被常人所接受的事情。"
"But it came to me then, I am sure, for the first time, how promiscuous, how higgledy-piggledy was the whole of that jumble of mines and homes, collieries and potbanks, railway yards, canals, schools, forges and blast furnaces, churches, chapels, allotment hovels, a vast irregular agglomeration of ugly smoking accidents in which men lived as happy as frogs in a dustbin.","但我可以确定的是，那时是我第一次感觉到那一切是那么的杂乱不堪——到处都是杂乱的矿井、收容所、煤矿、陶瓷厂、火车场、运河、学校、锻工车间、鼓风炉、大小教堂、贫民窟。而在这片浓烟笼罩的杂乱土地上生活的人们却像垃圾箱里的青蛙一样过得很快乐。"
"Each thing jostled and damaged the other things about it, each thing ignored the other things about it; the smoke of the furnace defiled the potbank clay, the clatter of the railway deafened the worshipers in church, the public-house thrust corruption at the school doors, the dismal homes squeezed miserably amidst the monstrosities of industrialism, with an effect of groping imbecility.","万物因其冲撞、相互伤害。万事因其而漠视他者。浓烟污染了陶瓷厂的黏土，铁轨的声音震耳欲聋，搅乱了教堂里教徒的清净，小酒店带坏了小孩子们，阴暗的收容所被庞大的工业主义所笼罩，成了低能儿的庇护所。"
"Humanity choked amidst its products, and all its energy went in increasing its disorder, like a blind stricken thing that struggles and sinks in a morass.","人性在工业化的产品中沦丧，所有的能量都只是徒增混乱，就像是盲人在沼泽地里挣扎一样，愈挣扎愈沉沦。"
"I did not think these things clearly that afternoon.","我想那天下午我并没有理清思绪。"
"Much less did I ask how I, with my murderous purpose, stood to them all.","我更没有想好我如何与那些人周旋，从而完成我的谋杀计划。"
"I write down that realization of disorder and suffocation here and now as though I had thought it, but indeed then I only felt it, felt it transitorily as I looked back, and then stood with the thing escaping from my mind.","而我如今于此写下的混乱和窒息感，似乎像是我曾仔细考虑过一样，而事实上，我当时只是感受到了而已。我在回望的那一刻感受到了，而后便又从我脑海中消失了。"
"I should never see that country-side again.","我可能再也看不到这片村落了。"
"I came back to that.","我的思绪又回来了。"
"At any rate I wasn’t sorry.","但我并不为此而遗憾。"
"The chances were I should die in sweet air, under a clean sky.","即使我要死去，也要在蔚蓝天空下呼吸着清新的空气死去。"
"From distant Swathinglea came a little sound, the minute undulation of a remote crowd, and then rapidly three shots.","远处的斯沃星利传来些许声响，先是人群躁动，紧接着就是三声枪响。"
"That held me perplexed for a space....","那让我一时间有些困惑……"
"Well, anyhow I was leaving it all!","哎，不管怎样，我要彻底离开这里了！"
"Thank God I was leaving it all!","感谢上帝我就要永远跟它说再见了！"
"Then, as I turned to go on, I thought of my mother.","但就在我转身踏上新的征程的时候，我想起了我的母亲。"
"It seemed an evil world in which to leave one’s mother.","这似乎是一个万恶的世界，而我却留下我的母亲。"
"My thoughts focused upon her very vividly for a moment.","我的思绪集中在母亲身上，瞬间清晰而鲜活。"
"Down there, under that afternoon light, she was going to and fro, unaware as yet that she had lost me, bent and poking about in the darkling underground kitchen, perhaps carrying a lamp into the scullery to trim, or sitting patiently, staring into the fire, waiting tea for me.","在那里，那天下午，她一定还在忙碌着，完全没有意识到她已经失去了我。她一定弯着腰在漆黑的地下厨房里四处摸索，或是提着油灯在那儿收拾碗柜，抑或是耐心地坐在那里，凝望着火苗，沏好了茶等我回家。"
"A great pity for her, a great remorse at the blacker troubles that lowered over her innocent head, came to me.","一想到我又要给她制造麻烦，而她单纯的心又要为我忧虑，一股发自内心的悔恨和对她的愧疚感油然而生。"
"Why, after all, was I doing this thing?","为什么，我到底为什么要做这件事？"
"Why?","为什么？"
"I stopped again dead, with the hill crest rising between me and home.","我再一次停下来，默默地站着，面前的山顶隔开了我和我的家。"
"I had more than half a mind to return to her.","我几乎想立刻回到她的身旁。"
"Then I thought of the curate’s sovereigns.","继而我又想到了牧师的硬币。"
"If he has missed them already, what should I return to?","如果他真的发觉钱少了，我要拿什么还他呢？"
"And, even if I returned, how could I put them back?","即便我能还给他，我又该怎么放回去呢？"
"And what of the night after I renounced my revenge?","况且，放弃了复仇后的那晚我又该做些什么呢？"
"What of the time when young Verrall came back?","小维罗尔到底什么时候才能回来？"
"And Nettie?","而妮蒂呢？"
"No!","不！"
"The thing had to be done.","我必须去做这件事。"
"But at least I might have kissed my mother before I came away, left her some message, reassured her at least for a little while.","至少我在临别前已经吻过母亲了，给了她一些暗示，至少那时她对我是放心的。"
"All night she would listen and wait for me.....","而她会整晚不睡，希望听到我的脚步声，等我回家……"
"Should I send her a telegram from Two-Mile Stone?","我应该从二里石发一封电报给她么？"
"It was no good now; too late, too late.","可这么做没什么好处，太迟了，太迟了。"
"To do that would be to tell the course I had taken, to bring pursuit upon me, swift and sure, if pursuit there was to be.","如果警察在追踪我的话，发电报就相当于告诉警察我的逃跑路线，让他们更加迅速、确定地抓到我。"
"No. My mother must suffer!","不行。看来只能让我的母亲忍受煎熬了！"
"I went on grimly toward Two-Mile Stone, but now as if some greater will than mine directed my footsteps thither.","我坚定地向二里石镇走去，似乎现在有股更强大的意志力鼓舞着我前行。"
"I reached Birmingham before darkness came, and just caught the last train for Monkshampton, where I had planned to pass the night.","我在天黑之前到达了伯明翰，正好赶上开往蒙克香普顿的最后一班列车，准备在车上过夜。"

"Chapter the Fifth","第五章"
"The Pursuit of the Two Lovers","追踪情侣"
"Section 1","第一节"
"As the train carried me on from Birmingham to Monkshampton, it carried me not only into a country where I had never been before, but out of the commonplace daylight and the touch and quality of ordinary things, into the strange unprecedented night that was ruled by the giant meteor of the last days.","当列车载着我离开伯明翰前往蒙克香普顿时，它不仅仅是带我进入一个我从未涉足的国度，更是带我远离毫无新意的白昼和毫无特质的平凡事物，进入这由末日的彗星的强烈光芒所主宰的前所未有和全然陌生的黑夜。"
"There was at that time a curious accentuation of the common alternation of night and day.","那个时候普通的日夜交替变得惊人地显著。"
"They became separated with a widening difference of value in regard to all mundane affairs.","世间万物的价值差异就随着日夜的分离不断增大。"
"During the day, the comet was an item in the newspapers, it was jostled by a thousand more living interests, it was as nothing in the skirts of the war storm that was now upon us.","白天，彗星不过是报纸上的一则消息，远不如无数其他消息那么引人注目。相对于即将降临的战争风暴，此时的彗星越发不值一提。"
"It was an astronomical phenomenon, somewhere away over China, millions of miles away in the deeps. ","它不过就是一个天文现象，远在遥远的中国上空，远在千万里之外的太空之中。"
"We forgot it.","我们对它毫不在意。"
"But directly the sun sank one turned ever and again toward the east, and the meteor resumed its sway over us.","但是每当太阳下山，人们又可以看到在东方上空摇曳的彗星了。"
"One waited for its rising, and yet each night it came as a surprise.","人们等待彗星升起，而每个夜晚，它都如同一个惊喜一样出现在人们的面前。"
"Always it rose brighter than one had dared to think, always larger and with some wonderful change in its outline, and now with a strange, less luminous, greener disk upon it that grew with its growth, the umbra of the earth.","每一次升起，它都比人们想象中的更大、更亮，轮廓都有些许奇妙的变幻。现在它的表面有个比它的光亮稍暗但更绿的碟状物，它随着彗星的膨胀而膨胀——那是地球在彗星表面的投影。"
"It shone also with its own light, so that this shadow was not hard or black, but it shone phosphorescently and with a diminishing intensity where the stimulus of the sun’s rays was withdrawn.","彗星本身也发光，因此这个阴影并不暗淡。但是，因为彗星发的磷光，所以太阳光线照不到的地方会逐渐变暗。"
"As it ascended toward the zenith, as the last trailing daylight went after the abdicating sun, its greenish white illumination banished the realities of day, diffused a bright ghostliness over all things.","当彗星渐渐升向最高点，当最后一抹阳光追随着让位的太阳消逝时，彗星绿白色的光芒将白昼驱逐，给万物铺上一层诡秘的光辉。"
"It changed the starless sky about it to an extraordinary deep blue, the profoundest color in the world, such as I have never seen before or since.","彗星的光芒将它周围没有星星的夜空变成了奇特的深蓝色，那是我从未见过，后来也不曾见到的世上最深的颜色。"
"I remember, too, that as I peered from the train that was rattling me along to Monkshampton, I perceived and was puzzled by a coppery red light that mingled with all the shadows that were cast by it.","我还记得，当时从驶往蒙克香普顿的列车向外张望，我能看到一束铜红色光线，那光线和彗星投下的阴影混杂着，我很想知道那铜红色光线到底是什么。"
"It turned our ugly English industrial towns to phantom cities.","彗星的光芒将我们丑陋的英格兰工业城镇变成了奇幻之城。"
"Everywhere the local authorities discontinued street lighting—one could read small print in the glare,—and so at Monkshampton I went about through pale, white, unfamiliar streets, whose electric globes had shadows on the path.","各地政府都把街灯关掉了——彗星的亮光使人能看清非常细小的字——所以在蒙克香普顿，我走在街上，感觉四周一片惨白，十分陌生。街边的球型灯罩在路上投下黑黑的阴影。"
"Lit windows here and there burnt ruddy orange, like holes cut in some dream curtain that hung before a furnace.","散发着橙红色光芒的窗户，散落在各处，像是在悬挂于炉火前的魔幻帘子上挖的洞。"
"A policeman with noiseless feet showed me an inn woven of moonshine, a green-faced man opened to us, and there I abode the night.","一位警察把我带到一个小旅馆前。他的步伐悄无声息，小旅馆沐浴着皎洁的月光。一个脸色发青的男子给我们开了门，我在那里住了一晚。"
"And the next morning it opened with a mighty clatter, and was a dirty little beerhouse that stank of beer, and there was a fat and grimy landlord with red spots upon his neck, and much noisy traffic going by on the cobbles outside.","翌日清晨，随着一声巨大的咯吱声，小旅馆开门迎客了。原来这不过是个充斥着啤酒味的脏兮兮的小酒馆。店主肥头大耳，污浊邋遢，脖子上还长着红斑。酒馆外的路上铺着鹅卵石，车辆过往发出嘈杂的声音。"
"I came out, after I had paid my bill, into a street that echoed to the bawlings of two newsvendors and to the noisy yappings of a dog they had raised to emulation.","我付了账走出酒馆来到街上。街上回荡着两个报贩的叫卖声和他们驯养的那条狗的狂吠声。"
"They were shouting: “Great British disaster in the North Sea. A battleship lost with all hands.""","他们大叫着：“北海之战，英军惨败！一战舰受创，全军覆没！”"
"I bought a paper, went on to the railway station reading such details as were given of this triumph of the old civilization, of the blowing up of this great iron ship, full of guns and explosives and the most costly and beautiful machinery of which that time was capable, together with nine hundred able-bodied men, all of them above the average, by a contact mine towed by a German submarine.","我买了份报纸，边看报边继续往火车站走去。报上刊登了消息的详细内容，那艘满载着枪支弹药和当时造价最高、设计最精美的机器的大铁船因触碰到德国潜艇牵引的接触水雷而发生爆炸，船上九百名体格健壮、出类拔萃的战士全部罹难。"
"I read myself into a fever of warlike emotions.","我读着读着，不禁热血沸腾，胸中涌起一股战斗的激情。"
"Not only did I forget the meteor, but for a time I forgot even the purpose that took me on to the railway station, bought my ticket, and was now carrying me onward to Shaphambury.","别说彗星，有一会儿我甚至把去火车站买票前往香普汉贝里的目的都给忘记了。这会儿，我正在前往香普汉贝里的路上。"
"So the hot day came to its own again, and people forgot the night.","白昼再次来临，人们便又忘记了夜晚。"
"Each night, there shone upon us more and more insistently, beauty, wonder, the promise of the deeps, and we were hushed, and marveled for a space.","晚上，夜空越发变得美丽、奇幻和深邃，让我们叹为观止。"
"And at the first gray sounds of dawn again, at the shooting of bolts and the noise of milk-carts, we forgot, and the dusty habitual day came yawning and stretching back again.","继而当看到黎明的第一道曙光，听到纷纷取下的门闩的响声和送奶车的吱嘎声时，我们便忘却了夜晚的一切。灰扑扑的白昼又一如既往地打着哈欠伸着懒腰回来了。"
"The stains of coal smoke crept across the heavens, and we rose to the soiled disorderly routine of life.","煤烟弥漫到空中留下痕迹，我们又开始了一天脏乱的日常生活。"
"“Thus life has always been,” we said; “thus it will always be.”","“生活向来如此，也终将如此。”我们如是说。"
"The glory of those nights was almost universally regarded as spectacular merely.","夜晚的璀璨光芒对普通大众来说最多也不过只是壮观的景象而已。"
"It signified nothing to us.","对我们来说并不是什么特别的征兆。"
"So far as western Europe went, it was only a small and ignorant section of the lower classes who regarded the comet as a portent of the end of the world.","目前为止，西欧只有很少一部分无知的底层民众将这个彗星当作世界末日来临的征兆。"
"Abroad, where there were peasantries, it was different, but in England the peasantry had already disappeared.","在国外还有农民的地方情况就不同了。但是英格兰早已经没有农民了。"
"Every one read.","人人都看报。"
"The newspaper, in the quiet days before our swift quarrel with Germany rushed to its climax, had absolutely dispelled all possibilities of a panic in this matter.","我们与德国的冲突迅速升级，在达到其最高潮之前的一段平静的日子里，报纸已经彻底消除了彗星带来任何恐慌的可能性。"
"The very tramps upon the high-roads, the children in the nursery, had learnt that at the utmost the whole of that shining cloud could weigh but a few score tons.","就连公路上的流浪汉和幼稚园的小孩都知道那一整个发光的云团最多也就重几十吨。"
"This fact had been shown quite conclusively by the enormous deflections that had at last swung it round squarely at our world.","彗星轨道发生的巨大偏移已经很好地证实了这一事实，正是这些偏移使它不偏不倚地出现在我们地球上空。"
"It had passed near three of the smallest asteroids without producing the minutest perceptible deflection in their course; while, on its own part, it had described a course through nearly three degrees.","彗星此前已经经过了三颗极小的小行星，人们却未察觉其轨道有丝毫偏向。而事实上，彗星轨道发生了将近三度的偏移。"
"When it struck our earth there was to be a magnificent spectacle, no doubt, for those who were on the right side of our planet to see, but beyond that nothing.","彗星撞向地球时，处在面对彗星的半球上的人们无疑将看到壮丽的奇景。而另一面的人们则什么也看不到。"
"It was doubtful whether we were on the right side.","但不能确定我们是不是在面对彗星的一面。"
"The meteor would loom larger and larger in the sky, but with the umbra of our earth eating its heart of brightness out, and at last it would be the whole sky, a sky of luminous green clouds, with a white brightness about the horizon, west and east.","彗星会因为逼近地球而显得越来越大，而地球在它上面的投影也会慢慢吞噬掉它的光亮。最后天空会布满发出绿光的云朵，而天际则会出现一圈白光。"
"Then a pause—a pause of not very exactly definite duration—and then, no doubt, a great blaze of shooting stars.","紧接着的会是短暂的停顿——停顿的确切时长无法确定——停顿过后无疑会看到一阵流星雨的耀眼光辉。"
"They might be of some unwonted color because of the unknown element that line in the green revealed.","由于我们看到的绿光中含有未知元素，流星可能会发出不寻常的光。"
"For a little while the zenith would spout shooting stars.","流星会持续一小会儿的时间。"
"Some, it was hoped, would reach the earth and be available for analysis.","人们希望有一些碎片会掉到地球上，以便对其做化学成分分析。"
"That, science said, would be all.","从科学的角度看，这事不过如此。"
"The green clouds would whirl and vanish, and there might be thunderstorms.","绿色云团会旋转乃至消失，而后可能会有雷阵雨。"
"But through the attenuated wisps of comet shine, the old sky, the old stars, would reappear, and all would be as it had been before.","但是透过渐渐变淡的彗星的光线，往日的天空、星星将会重现，一切将恢复原样。"
"And since this was to happen between one and eleven in the morning of the approaching Tuesday—I slept at Monkshampton on Saturday night,—it would be only partially visible, if visible at all, on our side of the earth.","因为这个过程将会在下个礼拜三凌晨一点到早上十一点之间发生——我这个礼拜六那晚在蒙克香普顿——所以，如果在我们所在的位置能看到的话，我也只能看到其中的一部分。"
"Perhaps, if it came late, one would see no more than a shooting star low down in the sky.","如果发生得再晚些，或许人们就只能看到流星划过天际了。"
"All this we had with the utmost assurances of science.","所有这些都有十分可信的科学依据。"
"Still it did not prevent the last nights being the most beautiful and memorable of human experiences.","但这一切，仍不妨碍彗星来临前的几个夜晚成为人类最美好、最值得留念的记忆。"
"The nights had become very warm, and when next day I had ranged Shaphambury in vain, I was greatly tormented, as that unparalleled glory of the night returned, to think that under its splendid benediction young Verrall and Nettie made love to one another.","夜晚已经变得相当暖和了。第二天我在香普汉贝里漫无目的地走了一天，那天夜晚的天空辉煌无比，但一想到年轻的维罗尔和妮蒂会在这曼妙的夜晚在床上翻云覆雨，我就备受煎熬。"
"I walked backward and forward, backward and forward, along the sea front, peering into the faces of the young couples who promenaded, with my hand in my pocket ready, and a curious ache in my heart that had no kindred with rage.","我沿着海边来来回回地逡巡，眼睛瞄向散步的年轻情侣们的脸庞，手揣在口袋里，时刻准备出击。但奇怪的是，我的心只是很痛，而非怒火中烧。"
"Until at last all the promenaders had gone home to bed, and I was alone with the star.","到最后，所有散步的人都回家睡觉去了，留我独自与星星为伴。"
"My train from Wyvern to Shaphambury that morning was a whole hour late; they said it was on account of the movement of troops to meet a possible raid from the Elbe.","那天早上我从威弗恩出发，火车晚了整整一个小时才到香普汉贝里。听说晚点是因为调遣部队去抵抗易北河可能会发生的袭击。"
"Section 2","第二节"
"Shaphambury seemed an odd place to me even then.","那时的香普汉贝里在我看来就已经是个奇怪的地方了。"
"But something was quickening in me at that time to feel the oddness of many accepted things.","某些东西让平日习以为常的事物显得怪异。"
"Now in the retrospect I see it as intensely queer.","现在回想起来，那个地方真是极其古怪。"
"The whole place was strange to my untraveled eyes; the sea even was strange.","对于我这双缺乏见识的眼睛而言，这整个地方显得很陌生，而大海看起来甚至有些怪异。"
"Only twice in my life had I been at the seaside before, and then I had gone by excursion to places on the Welsh coast whose great cliffs of rock and mountain backgrounds made the effect of the horizon very different from what it is upon the East Anglian seaboard.","此前我只去过海边两次。后来我去了威尔士沿海的一些地方远足。那里巨石悬崖和其后的山脉使得地平线看起来与盎格鲁东部海滨的截然不同。"
"Here what they call a cliff was a crumbling bank of whitey-brown earth not fifty feet high.","而这儿称之为悬崖的不过是不足50英尺、似要崩塌白褐色土质斜坡。"
"So soon as I arrived I made a systematic exploration of Shaphambury.","一到香普汉贝里我就对它进行了系统的勘查。"
"To this day I retain the clearest memories of the plan I shaped out then, and how my inquiries were incommoded by the overpowering desire of every one to talk of the chances of a German raid, before the Channel Fleet got round to us.","时至今日，我仍清晰地记得我当时制定的计划和人们对我的询问表现出来的冷淡。当时，人们的关注点都在战争上，大家热烈地谈论着在海峡舰队到来之前来自德军可能的攻势，致使我的询问无人理会。"
"I slept at a small public-house in a Shaphambury back street on Sunday night.","礼拜天晚上我就睡在香普汉贝里一条偏僻街道的小旅馆里。"
"I did not get on to Shaphambury from Wyvern until two in the afternoon, because of the infrequency of Sunday trains, and I got no clue whatever until late in the afternoon of Monday.","由于礼拜天的火车很少，我从威弗恩出发后抵达香普汉贝时已是下午两点了。到了那里后我没找到任何线索，直到礼拜一下午才出现转机。"
"As the little local train bumped into sight of the place round the curve of a swelling hill, one saw a series of undulating grassy spaces, amidst which a number of conspicuous notice-boards appealed to the eye and cut up the distant sea horizon.","小火车颠簸进入一片山丘，映入眼帘的是绵延起伏的草地和其间许多引人注目的广告牌，这些广告牌把远处的海平线给割断了。"
"Most of these referred to comestibles or to remedies to follow the comestibles; and they were colored with a view to be memorable rather than beautiful, to “stand out” amidst the gentle grayish tones of the east coast scenery.","大部分的广告都是关于食品或需要这类食品的食疗法的。这些广告牌漆得五颜六色，不是为了显得好看，而是为了使人们过目不忘，使它们在东海岸灰暗温和的景色里显得“与众不同”。"
"The greater number, I may remark, of the advertisements that were so conspicuous a factor in the life of those days, and which rendered our vast tree-pulp newspapers possible, referred to foods, drinks, tobacco, and the drugs that promised a restoration of the equanimity these other articles had destroyed.","可以说，海量的广告明显是那时人们生活中的一部分，它们使得劣质报纸的发行成为可能。这些广告宣传的是食品、饮料、烟草以及药品，而这些药品保证能恢复被其他物品破坏的镇静。"
"Wherever one went one was reminded in glaring letters that, after all, man was little better than a worm, that eyeless, earless thing that burrows and lives uncomplainingly amidst nutritious dirt, “an alimentary canal with the subservient appendages thereto.”","人们所到之处都有抢眼的标语，这些字眼令人联想到一点：人比蚯蚓好不到哪里去。这些蠕虫无耳无眼，毫无怨言地穴居于肥沃的土壤中，不过是“带着些附属物的消化道”而已。"
"But in addition to such boards there were also the big black and white boards of various grandiloquently named “estates.”","但除此以外也还有些大大的黑白广告牌，夸张地写着各式各样的房地产广告。"
"The individualistic enterprise of that time had led to the plotting out of nearly all the country round the seaside towns into roads and building-plots—all but a small portion of the south and east coast was in this condition, and had the promises of those schemes been realized the entire population of the island might have been accommodated upon the sea frontiers.","那时候的个人主义创业精神致使几乎所有海滨城镇周围的农村被划分成道路和建筑用地，除了南部和东部沿海的一小部分地区。如果这个计划的前景实现了的话，那岛上的所有居民可能都已经住到海边去了。"
"Nothing of the sort happened, of course; the whole of this uglification of the coast-line was done to stimulate a little foolish gambling in plots, and one saw everywhere agents’ boards in every state of freshness and decay, ill-made exploitation roads overgrown with grass, and here and there, at a corner, a label, “Trafalgar Avenue,” or “Sea View Road.”","当然，这种事情根本没有发生。所有这些对海岸线的丑化只是刺激了人们对某些地方愚蠢又冒险的小额投资。到处可见各代理商或新或旧的广告牌、长满杂草的粗制滥造的公路，和隐匿在角落的路牌，上面写着诸如“特拉法尔加大道”或者“海景路”之类的名称。"
"Here and there, too, some small investor, some shopman with “savings,” had delivered his soul to the local builders and built himself a house, and there it stood, ill-designed, mean-looking, isolated, ill-placed on a cheaply fenced plot, athwart which his domestic washing fluttered in the breeze amidst a bleak desolation of enterprise.","除此以外，四处可见的还有某个小投资者或是有点儿小积蓄店员倾其所有请当地的建筑商为自己建的房子。房子设计拙劣、外观丑陋、偏居于某个廉价篱笆围起来的地皮上。斜晾在屋外的衣服在微风中翻飞，散发出凄凉萧条的气息。"
"Then presently our railway crossed a high road, and a row of mean yellow brick houses—workmen’s cottages, and the filthy black sheds that made the “allotments” of that time a universal eyesore, marked our approach to the more central areas of—I quote the local guidebook—“one of the most delightful resorts in the East Anglian poppy-land.”","紧接着火车穿过一条公路,一排难看的黄色砖房（那是工人们的落脚处）和一片脏兮兮的黑色简易棚（对任何人来说都是不堪入目的）,我逐渐靠近中心地带，当地导游指南称之为“东盎格鲁罂粟地最让人开心的度假胜地之一”。"
"Then more mean houses, the gaunt ungainliness of the electric force station—it had a huge chimney, because no one understood how to make combustion of coal complete—and then we were in the railway station, and barely three-quarters of a mile from the center of this haunt of health and pleasure.","接着映入眼帘的是更加丑陋的房子和破败不堪、畸形的发电站——烟囱无比硕大，因为没人知道如何才能让煤炭完全燃烧。然后我们的火车进了站，这时我们离充满健康快乐的“胜地”只有四分之三英里。"
"I inspected the town thoroughly before I made my inquiries.","在向别人打听之前，我先细细地观察了一下这个镇。"
"The road began badly with a row of cheap, pretentious, insolvent-looking shops, a public-house, and a cab-stand, but, after an interval of little red villas that were partly hidden amidst shrubbery gardens, broke into a confusedly bright but not unpleasing High Street, shuttered that afternoon and sabbatically still.","街道入口处就很不雅——一排廉价、残破的商铺，一个酒馆和一个马车停靠点。但经过过半隐匿在灌木丛中的红色小别墅区后，街道突然变得异常明亮，看上去也不至于令人不悦。那天下午，整个街道显得很肃静。"
"Somewhere in the background a church bell jangled, and children in bright, new-looking clothes were going to Sunday-school.","街后某处的教堂传来钟声，穿戴一新的孩子们就要去主日学校上课了。"
"Thence through a square of stuccoed lodging-houses, that seemed a finer and cleaner version of my native square, I came to a garden of asphalt and euonymus—the Sea Front.","穿过一片用泥灰粉刷过的出租房后——和我家乡的很像，只是好看点儿、干净点儿——我便来到了由沥青、灌木构成的花园——海滨大道。"
"I sat down on a cast-iron seat, and surveyed first of all the broad stretches of muddy, sandy beach, with its queer wheeled bathing machines, painted with the advertisements of somebody’s pills—and then at the house fronts that stared out upon these visceral counsels.","在一个铸铁椅子上坐下，我首先看到前面绵延的沙滩和带轮子的怪异的更衣车，车身上漆着药品广告。在这些关于内脏护理广告的对面是一排房子。"
"Boarding-houses, private hotels, and lodging-houses in terraces clustered closely right and left of me, and then came to an end; in one direction scaffolding marked a building enterprise in progress, in the other, after a waste interval, rose a monstrous bulging red shape, a huge hotel, that dwarfed all other things.","我左右则是鳞次栉比的招待所、私人旅馆和出租房。再望得远一点儿，能看到一头有脚手架，说明那儿正在施工，另一头，一堆废墟后面陡然耸起一个大得出奇的红色物体。仔细一看，原来是一座巨大的旅馆，周围的建筑相形见绌。"
"Northward were low pale cliffs with white denticulations of tents, where the local volunteers, all under arms, lay encamped, and southward, a spreading waste of sandy dunes, with occasional bushes and clumps of stunted pine and an advertisement board or so.","北边是低矮的灰色崖壁，上边有排成锯齿状的白色帐篷，当地的志愿者们正准备扎营。南边绵延着一片荒漠的沙丘，偶尔能看到灌木丛、成簇的矮松和广告牌等。"
"A hard blue sky hung over all this prospect, the sunshine cast inky shadows, and eastward was a whitish sea.","湛蓝的天空悬在这所有的景物之上，阳光投下墨色阴影，东方则是泛白的海面。"
"It was Sunday, and the midday meal still held people indoors.","今天是礼拜天，人们还在家里享用午餐呢。"
"A queer world!","真是个诡异的地方！"
"thought I even then—to you now it must seem impossibly queer,—and after an interval I forced myself back to my own affair.","那会儿我还是这么想——当然现在对你来说肯定毫无诡异可言——过了一会儿我才逼自己思考自身的事情了。"
"How was I to ask?","我该怎么问？"
"What was I to ask for?","又该问些什么呢？"
"I puzzled for a long time over that—at first I was a little tired and indolent—and then presently I had a flow of ideas.","我想了很久——刚开始我是有点儿累有点儿懒散——但是不久我便有了思路。"
"My solution was fairly ingenious.","我的办法是相当巧妙的。"
"I invented the following story.","我编造了这样一个故事："
"I happened to be taking a holiday in Shaphambury, and I was making use of the opportunity to seek the owner of a valuable feather boa, which had been left behind in the hotel of my uncle at Wyvern by a young lady, traveling with a young gentleman—no doubt a youthful married couple.","我碰巧来香普汉贝里来度假，因此借这个要会来寻找一位年轻女失主。这位失主在威弗恩旅行时把她价值不菲的羽毛披肩落在了我叔叔的旅馆里。她当时是和一位年轻人一块儿的——他们无疑是对年轻的夫妇。"
"They had reached Shaphambury somewhen on Thursday.","这对夫妇大概在礼拜四抵达了香普汉贝里。"
"I went over the story many times, and gave my imaginary uncle and his hotel plausible names.","我反复将这个故事演绎了很多遍，并且分别为我假想的叔叔以及他的旅馆取了个可信的名字。"
"At any rate this yarn would serve as a complete justification for all the questions I might wish to ask.","总之，这个故事已经能够为我可能要问的问题提供充足理由了。"
"I settled that, but I still sat for a time, wanting the energy to begin.","这么决定后，我继续坐了一会儿，积聚精力准备行动。"
"Then I turned toward the big hotel.","接着我转身来到了这个大旅馆。"
"Its gorgeous magnificence seemed to my inexpert judgment to indicate the very place a rich young man of good family would select.","以我并不专业的判断，这种富丽堂皇的地方应该是出身显赫的贵公子的首选。"
"Huge draught-proof doors were swung round for me by an ironically polite under-porter in a magnificent green uniform, who looked at my clothes as he listened to my question and then with a German accent referred me to a gorgeous head porter, who directed me to a princely young man behind a counter of brass and polish, like a bank—like several banks.","身着精致的绿色制服的行李员为我打开密不透风的旋转的大门，礼貌得可笑。他边听我的询问，边打量着我的衣着。然后他用德国口音指了指一个身着华丽的高级侍者，示意我去问他。这位侍者又示意我去问柜台后一个高贵的年轻人。柜台是铜制抛光了的，简直像个银行——像几个银行才对。"
"This young man, while he answered me, kept his eye on my collar and tie—and I knew that they were abominable.","这个年轻人在回答我询问的时候，眼睛一直盯着我的衣领和领带——我知道它们不堪入目。"
"“I want to find a lady and gentleman who came to Shaphambury on Tuesday,” I said.","我说：“我想找一位女士和一位先生，他们是星期二来这里的。”"
"“Friends of yours?”","“你的朋友？”"
"he asked with a terrible fineness of irony.","他问道，口吻极具嘲讽意味。"
"I made out at last that here at any rate the young people had not been.","最后我终于弄清楚，那两个年轻人未曾来过这儿。"
"They might have lunched there, but they had had no room.","他们或许在这里吃过午餐，但是没有订房间。"
"But I went out—door opened again for me obsequiously—in a state of social discomfiture, and did not attack any other establishment that afternoon.","于是我便只好出去了——侍者彬彬有礼地为我打开门——身受社交挫败的打击，那天下午我没再去别的地方打听。"
"My resolution had come to a sort of ebb.","我的决心陷入低潮。"
"More people were promenading, and their Sunday smartness abashed me.","散步的人越来越多，他们身着漂亮的礼服，令我自惭形秽。"
"I forgot my purpose in an acute sense of myself.","过分在意自己的形象使我忘记了此行的目的。"
"I felt that the bulge of my pocket caused by the revolver was conspicuous, and I was ashamed.","口袋里装着左轮手枪，摸起来鼓鼓囊囊的，十分抢眼，让我颇为不好意思。"
"I went along the sea front away from the town, and presently lay down among pebbles and sea poppies.","我沿着海滨大道往背离小镇的方向走，走了没多大会儿，便在鹅卵石和海罂粟花间躺了下来。"
"This mood of reaction prevailed with me all that afternoon.","整个下午，这种受挫的情绪一直萦绕着我。"
"In the evening, about sundown, I went to the station and asked questions of the outporters there.","傍晚时分我来到车站，询问那里行李搬运工。"
"But outporters, I found, were a class of men who remembered luggage rather than people, and I had no sort of idea what luggage young Verrall and Nettie were likely to have with them.","但是我发现他们记得的是行李而不是人。而年轻的维罗尔和妮蒂可能会带什么行李，对此我毫无头绪。"
"Then I fell into conversation with a salacious wooden-legged old man with a silver ring, who swept the steps that went down to the beach from the parade.","后来我和一位言辞猥亵的老人攀谈起来。他装着木制假肢，戴着银戒指，正在由广场通往沙滩的台阶上挪动。"
"He knew much about young couples, but only in general terms, and nothing of the particular young couple I sought.","他见过很多年轻夫妇，但也只知道个大概。对于我要寻找的那对夫妇，他却一无所知。"
"He reminded me in the most disagreeable way of the sensuous aspects of life, and I was not sorry when presently a gunboat appeared in the offing signalling the coastguard and the camp, and cut short his observations upon holidays, beaches, and morals.","他用一种让人难以苟同的方式谈论生活中的情欲方面的事情。因此，当海面上出现一艘炮艇，示意要在此进行海防和扎营，因而打断了他关于度假、海滩和道德的谈话时，我丝毫不觉得遗憾。"
"I went, and now I was past my ebb, and sat in a seat upon the parade, and watched the brightening of those rising clouds of chilly fire that made the ruddy west seem tame.","我走向广场，此时我的低潮期已经过了，我找了个椅子坐下，看着冰冷的信号弹的烟雾向上升起，越来越亮，使得西边红色的天空显得沉闷。"
"My midday lassitude was going, my blood was running warmer again.","中午的懈怠正慢慢消逝，此时我的血液又慢慢温热地流淌了。"
"And as the twilight and that filmy brightness replaced the dusty sunlight and robbed this unfamiliar place of all its matter-of-fact queerness, its sense of aimless materialism, romance returned to me, and passion, and my thoughts of honor and revenge.","当余晖和彗星蒙眬的光亮取代灰尘弥漫的阳光，将这个陌生地方一贯的怪异、毫无目的的物质主义倾向隐藏起来之后，浪漫、激情，以及我的荣誉感和复仇心又重新回到我的脑海。"
"I remember that change of mood as occurring very vividly on this occasion, but I fancy that less distinctly I had felt this before many times.","我现在还清晰地记得当时情绪的变化，但我以为在那之前也有过很多次这样的感觉，只是没有如此明晰罢了。"
"In the old times, night and the starlight had an effect of intimate reality the daytime did not possess.","在那些岁月里，夜晚和星光能给人以柔和现实的效果，这是白昼不具备的。"
"The daytime—as one saw it in towns and populous places—had hold of one, no doubt, but only as an uproar might, it was distracting, conflicting, insistent.","白天无疑约束了所有人，这一点任何人在城镇或其他聚居的地方都能观察到。白天只是一股喧嚣的力量，令人心神不宁，矛盾重重、冥顽不灵。"
"Darkness veiled the more salient aspects of those agglomerations of human absurdity, and one could exist—one could imagine.","黑暗遮住了人类最荒谬可笑的部分，这样人才生存下来——才能够去想象。"
"I had a queer illusion that night, that Nettie and her lover were close at hand, that suddenly I should come on them.","那晚我幻想着妮蒂和她的情人手牵着手，而我突然出现在他们面前。"
"I have already told how I went through the dusk seeking them in every couple that drew near.","我已经告诉你们我是如何在暮色中穿梭，仔细观察从我身边经过的每一对情侣。"
"And I dropped asleep at last in an unfamiliar bedroom hung with gaudily decorated texts, cursing myself for having wasted a day.","然后最终我还是在一个挂着花哨饰物的陌生卧室里倒头睡下，埋怨自己浪费了一天的光阴。"
"Section 3","第三节"
"I sought them in vain the next morning, but after midday I came in quick succession on a perplexing multitude of clues.","第二天早上还是搜寻无果，但是午后我却很快找到了大量令人费解的线索。"
"After failing to find any young couple that corresponded to young Verrall and Nettie, I presently discovered an unsatisfactory quartette of couples.","此前没有发现一对符合小维罗尔和妮蒂特征的夫妇，但此时我发现四对夫妇很可疑。"
"Any of these four couples might have been the one I sought; with regard to none of them was there conviction.","从他们都不定居此地这点看来，他们中任何一对都有可能是我要找的人。"
"They had all arrived either on Wednesday or Thursday.","他们都是礼拜三或礼拜四来的。"
"Two couples were still in occupation of their rooms, but neither of these were at home.","其中两对都保留着订的房间，但是都不在。"
"Late in the afternoon I reduced my list by eliminating a young man in drab, with side whiskers and long cuffs, accompanied by a lady, of thirty or more, of consciously ladylike type. I was disgusted at the sight of them;","傍晚时分，我删掉了名单中一个年轻人的名字。他身着黑褐色衣服，袖口很长，蓄着络腮胡，和她一起的女士三十出头，明显的贵妇人模样。第一眼看到他们我就觉得很反感。"
"the other two young people had gone for a long walk, and though I watched their boarding-house until the fiery cloud shone out above, sharing and mingling in an unusually splendid sunset, I missed them.","另外两对夫妇出门远行散步去了。我在他们住房外等候直到上空火红的云和异常绚烂的夕阳交相辉映，他们还是没有回来。"
"Then I discovered them dining at a separate table in the bow window, with red-shaded candles between them, peering out ever and again at this splendor that was neither night nor day.","之后我发现他们在一个独立餐桌上用餐，桌子靠近拱形窗户，上面摆着蜡烛。他们时不时地望望窗外非昼非夜的奇景。"
"The girl in her pink evening dress looked very light and pretty to me—pretty enough to enrage me,—she had well shaped arms and white, well-modeled shoulders, and the turn of her cheek and the fair hair about her ears was full of subtle delights; but she was not Nettie, and the happy man with her was that odd degenerate type our old aristocracy produced with such odd frequency, chinless, large bony nose, small fair head, languid expression, and a neck that had demanded and received a veritable sleeve of collar.","女孩穿着粉色晚礼服，看起来清新亮丽——足够让我愤愤不平了——秀臂削肩，颧骨的曲线和耳际的金发散发着无以名状的喜悦。但是她不是妮蒂，和她一起的幸福男人是旧式精英阶层很少培养的颓废派人士——下巴很短、鼻头很大、脑袋很小、头发浅黄色、表情慵懒、脖子细长——以致衣领就像袖子一样。"
"I stood outside in the meteor’s livid light, hating them and cursing them for having delayed me so long.","我站在餐厅外彗星的青色光辉中，厌恶地诅咒他们耽误了我这么长时间。"
"I stood until it was evident they remarked me, a black shape of envy, silhouetted against the glare.","我一直站在那里，直到他们注意到我这个强光下充满妒意黑色轮廓。"
"That finished Shaphambury.","香普汉贝里之行一无所获。"
"The question I now had to debate was which of the remaining couples I had to pursue.","现在的问题是我该去追踪剩下那两对情侣中的哪一对呢。"
"I walked back to the parade trying to reason my next step out, and muttering to myself, because there was something in that luminous wonderfulness that touched one’s brain, and made one feel a little light-headed.","我又往广场方向折回去，边走边自言自语，想要理清下一步该怎么走，因为这夜光中有些奇妙的东西能触及大脑，让人有点儿发晕。"
"One couple had gone to London; the other had gone to the Bungalow village at Bone Cliff.","一对去了伦敦，另外一对去了骨崖的邦格楼村。"
"Where, I wondered, was Bone Cliff?","但是，骨崖又在哪儿呢？"
"I came upon my wooden-legged man at the top of his steps.","我走向我的木头假肢伙计，他正爬上台阶。"
"“Hullo,” said I.","“嘿，”我打了个招呼。"
"He pointed seaward with his pipe, his silver ring shone in the sky light.","他用烟斗指着海，银戒指在曳光下闪闪发亮。"
"“Rum,” he said.","“怪事，”他说道。"
"“What is?”","“你说什么？”"
"I asked.","我问道。"
"“Search-lights!","“探射灯！"
"Smoke!","烟雾！"
"Ships going north!","往北进发的舰队！"
"If it wasn’t for this blasted Milky Way gone green up there, we might see.”","要不是那变成绿色的该死的银河，我们可能看得到的它们的。”"
"He was too intent to heed my questions for a time.","他太过专注，完全没留意我提的问题。"
"Then he vouchsafed over his shoulder—","好一会儿，他才搭理我。背对着我说："
"“Know Bungalow village?—rather.","“知不知道邦格楼村？——那当然。"
"Artis’ and such.","艺术家之类的人的去处。"
"Nice goings on!","地方不错！"
"Mixed bathing—something scandalous.","那儿的人男女混合洗浴——有点儿伤风败俗。"
"Yes.”","对，没错。”"
"“But where is it?”","“但是，到底在哪儿呢？”"
"I said, suddenly exasperated.","我突然气急败坏起来。"
"“There!”","“看！”"
"he said.","他说，"
"“What’s that flicker?","“有什么东西在闪？"
"A gunflash—or I’m a lost soul!”","信号弹？我都糊涂了！”"
"“You’d hear,” I said, “long before it was near enough to see a flash.”","“在看到闪光靠近之前，你早该听到的发射信号弹的枪响的。”我说道。"
"He didn’t answer.","他没理睬我。"
"Only by making it clear I would distract him until he told me what I wanted to know could I get him to turn from his absorbed contemplation of that phantom dance between the sea rim and the shine.","我得让他明白在他告诉我答案之前我会不停干扰他，这样我才能让他转移注意力，他才不会死盯着那个在海天之间舞动的鬼魅光影。"
"Indeed I gripped his arm and shook him.","于是我抓起他的胳膊摇晃起来。"
"Then he turned upon me cursing.","他这才骂骂咧咧地转过身来。"
"“Seven miles,” he said, “along this road.","“七英里，”他说，“沿着这条路。"
"And now go to ‘ell with yer!”","赶紧给我滚！”"
"I answered with some foul insult by way of thanks, and so we parted, and I set off towards the bungalow village.","我谢他的时候也顺便回敬了他几句辱骂的话，然后我便同他分开，朝邦格楼村进发。"
"I found a policeman, standing star-gazing, a little way beyond the end of the parade, and verified the wooden-legged man’s directions.","广场不远处站着两眼放空的警察，我向他确认了木头假肢老人说的方向。"
"“It’s a lonely road, you know,” he called after me....","“你得知道，那条路很偏僻……”他在我身后喊道。"
"I had an odd intuition that now at last I was on the right track.","当时，一种奇怪的直觉告诉我，我终于找到了正确的追踪路线。"
"I left the dark masses of Shaphambury behind me, and pushed out into the dim pallor of that night, with the quiet assurance of a traveler who nears his end.","我离开香普汉贝里黑压压的人群，带着旅行者即将抵达终点般的信心扑进那苍白蒙眬的夜色。"
"The incidents of that long tramp I do not recall in any orderly succession, the one progressive thing is my memory of a growing fatigue.","长途跋涉的细枝末节我已记不大清了，唯一清晰的记忆是日渐沉重的疲惫。"
"The sea was for the most part smooth and shining like a mirror, a great expanse of reflecting silver, barred by slow broad undulations, but at one time a little breeze breathed like a faint sigh and ruffled their long bodies into faint scaly ripples that never completely died out again.","海面大部分是平滑的，像镜子般闪耀着银光，缓缓行进的宽阔海浪将它框住。但偶尔微风吹来，像一阵轻声的叹息，将庞大的海面褶皱出永不再平息的涟漪。"
"The way was sometimes sandy, thick with silvery colorless sand, and sometimes chalky and lumpy, with lumps that had shining facets; a black scrub was scattered, sometimes in thickets, sometimes in single bunches, among the somnolent hummocks of sand.","有时候路面多沙，上面铺了厚厚的一层，发出银色白光；有时候很多块状物，块状物的表面很亮，路面因而也呈现白色，还十分颠簸。昏睡的沙丘间布满了成丛或单簇的黑色灌木。"
"At one place came grass, and ghostly great sheep looming up among the gray.","后来经过了一个草丛，那儿有巨大的羊群在灰色夜色中如鬼魅般若隐若现。"
"After a time black pinewoods intervened, and made sustained darknesses along the road, woods that frayed out at the edges to weirdly warped and stunted trees.","路边间或有黑色松林，因为挡住了光线所以路边总是黑漆漆的。丛林边缘的树木畸形矮小，煞是奇怪。"
"Then isolated pine witches would appear, and make their rigid gestures at me as I passed.","然后会出现女巫般的独松，我路过的时候它们摆着僵硬的姿势向我打招呼。"
"Grotesquely incongruous amidst these forms, I presently came on estate boards, appealing, “Houses can be built to suit purchaser,” to the silence, to the shadows, and the glare.","不一会儿，我又在这些怪异突兀的事物之中看到房地产广告牌，对着寂静、影子和光芒呼喊着：“可按购买者意愿建造房产”。"
"Once I remember the persistent barking of a dog from somewhere inland of me, and several times I took out and examined my revolver very carefully.","我一度记得从内心某处传来的不停的狗吠声，我好几次掏出左轮手枪，仔细地检查。"
"I must, of course, have been full of my intention when I did that, I must have been thinking of Nettie and revenge, but I cannot now recall those emotions at all.","无疑，当我在检查手枪时，满脑子想的肯定都是那次出行的意图，是妮蒂和复仇。但是，我现在竟然完全想不起当时的情绪了。"
"Only I see again very distinctly the greenish gleams that ran over lock and barrel as I turned the weapon in my hand.","仍然历历在目的，是我转动手枪时透过枪管和枪锁的绿光。"
"Then there was the sky, the wonderful, luminous, starless, moonless sky, and the empty blue deeps of the edge of it, between the meteor and the sea.","呈现在眼前的是天空——美妙、灿烂、星月全无的天空——和曳光海面之间纯粹深蓝的天际。"
"And once—strange phantoms!—I saw far out upon the shine, and very small and distant, three long black warships, without masts, or sails, or smoke, or any lights, dark, deadly, furtive things, traveling very swiftly and keeping an equal distance.","突然我发现遥远的前方有什么诡异的东西！原来是三艘长长的黑色战舰，因距离的关系显得很小。战舰上既无桅杆也无船帆，更无烟雾或光亮，显得漆黑、死寂、鬼鬼祟祟。它们相互保持着距离飞速前行。"
"And when I looked again they were very small, and then the shine had swallowed them up.","我再抬眼看过去时，它们已经显得非常微小，不一会儿就被光芒吞噬了。"
"Then once a flash and what I thought was a gun, until I looked up and saw a fading trail of greenish light still hanging in the sky.","突然出现了一道闪光——起初我以为是枪炮的火光——待我抬头，看到的却是残留在空中绿光的尾迹。"
"And after that there was a shiver and whispering in the air, a stronger throbbing in one’s arteries, a sense of refreshment, a renewal of purpose....","而后空气中一阵振动，传来很轻的声响。随着脉搏的一阵强烈悸动，人突然神清气爽，我又找回了我的决心……"
"Somewhere upon my way the road forked, but I do not remember whether that was near Shaphambury or near the end of my walk.","我记得我遇到过岔路口，但是我忘记了是刚离开香普汉贝里时还是快到达终点时。"
"The hesitation between two rutted unmade roads alone remains clear in my mind.","我唯一记得的，是我在两条尚未修好、满是车辙的山路之间犹豫不决的情形。"
"At last I grew weary.","我终于筋疲力尽。"
"I came to piled heaps of decaying seaweed and cart tracks running this way and that, and then I had missed the road and was stumbling among sand hummocks quite close to the sea.","我选了那条满是成堆正腐烂的海草的路，马车的车辙到处都是。结果我迷失了方向，在靠近海边的沙丘间跌跌撞撞。"
"I came out on the edge of the dimly glittering sandy beach, and something phosphorescent drew me to the water’s edge.","我走出沙丘来到闪烁着微光的沙滩边缘，某个闪着磷光的东西将我吸引至水边。"
"I bent down and peered at the little luminous specks that floated in the ripples.","我弯下腰凝视着在微波中浮动的小光斑。"
"Presently with a sigh I stood erect, and contemplated the lonely peace of that last wonderful night.","看了一会我叹息着直起了身子，冥想着这最后一个美妙的夜晚孤独的宁静。"
"The meteor had now trailed its shining nets across the whole space of the sky and was beginning to set; in the east the blue was coming to its own again; the sea was an intense edge of blackness, and now, escaped from that great shine, and faint and still tremulously valiant, one weak elusive star could just be seen, hovering on the verge of the invisible.","彗星已经在空中布下一张发光的网，正徐徐升起；东边的蓝色又将出现；海面漆黑一片。此时，一颗微弱的、似有若无的星星，摆脱了那强烈的光芒，战栗着但勇敢地在边缘处闪着微光。"
"How beautiful it was!","多么美妙！"
"how still and beautiful!","多么宁静多么美好！"
"Peace!","和平！"
"peace!—the peace that passeth understanding, robed in light descending!...","和平！和平使人们相互理解，它穿着光之外衣来到人间……"
"My heart swelled, and suddenly I was weeping.","我心潮澎湃，不禁潸然泪下。"
"There was something new and strange in my blood.","血液中充斥了一些新奇的东西。"
"It came to me that indeed I did not want to kill.","它使我意识到，其实我不想杀人的。"
"I did not want to kill.","我不想杀人。"
"I did not want to be the servant of my passions any more.","我再不愿受情感支配了。"
"A great desire had come to me to escape from life, from the daylight which is heat and conflict and desire, into that cool night of eternity—and rest.","一种强烈的逃离的欲望袭来，我想要逃开生活，逃开那充斥着冲突和欲望的炽热白昼，遁入清凉的永恒之夜——然后好好地休息。"
"I had played—I had done.","我已经玩过了，玩够了。"
"I stood upon the edge of the great ocean, and I was filled with an inarticulate spirit of prayer, and I desired greatly—peace from myself.","我站在茫茫大海边，心中充满莫可名状的祷告者般的灵魂，渴求着内心的和平。"
"And presently, there in the east, would come again the red discoloring curtain over these mysteries, the finite world again, the gray and growing harsh certainties of dawn.","不久，掩盖当下神秘的红色渐变色窗帘、愈加刺目的灰色黎明和有限的世界又将在东方出现。"
"My resolve I knew would take up with me again.","我知道，复仇的决心将再次占据我的心灵。"
"This was a rest for me, an interlude, but to-morrow I should be William Leadford once more, ill-nourished, ill-dressed, ill-equipped and clumsy, a thief and shamed, a wound upon the face of life, a source of trouble and sorrow even to the mother I loved; no hope in life left for me now but revenge before my death.","夜晚对我来说只是短暂的休憩，只是幕间休息而已。明天我还是那个营养不良、衣衫褴褛、贫困潦倒、笨手笨脚的威廉·利德福特。我是盗贼、是耻辱、是生活脸上的伤口、是麻烦和悲伤的源头——即使对我深爱的母亲来说，亦是如此。如今我的生命中已经没有希望，我的余生除了复仇别无其他。"
"Why this paltry thing, revenge?","为什么我的生命只剩下可鄙的复仇？"
"It entered into my thoughts that I might end the matter now and let these others go.","或许我该就此了结此事，饶恕他人。"
"To wade out into the sea, into this warm lapping that mingled the natures of water and light, to stand there breast-high, to thrust my revolver barrel into my mouth—?","如果走进大海，让波光相融的海水漫过胸部，然后将手枪枪口塞到嘴巴里扣动扳机，如何呢？"
"Why not?","为什么不？"
"I swung about with an effort.","我努力转过身。"
"I walked slowly up the beach thinking....","缓缓走上沙滩，思索着……"
"I turned and looked back at the sea.","我再次转过身来看着大海。"
"No!","不！"
"Something within me said, “No!”","心里某个东西在呼喊：“不！”"
"I must think.","我得好好想想。"
"It was troublesome to go further because the hummocks and the tangled bushes began.","前方开始出现沙丘和缠绕的灌木丛，路越来越难走。"
"I sat down amidst a black cluster of shrubs, and rested, chin on hand.","于是我在一堆黑色灌木丛间坐下来休息，双手托着下巴。"
"I drew my revolver from my pocket and looked at it, and held it in my hand.","然后我从口袋里掏出左轮手枪看了看，紧紧握着。"
"Life?","生？"
"Or Death?...","或死？……"
"I seemed to be probing the very deeps of being, but indeed imperceptibly I fell asleep, and sat dreaming.","我似乎在思考生命存在的深度，然而我却不知不觉沉入梦乡。"
"Section 4","第四节"
"Two people were bathing in the sea.","两个人在海里游泳。"
"I had awakened.","我醒了。"
"It was still that white and wonderful night, and the blue band of clear sky was no wider than before.","依然是白亮美妙的夜晚。带状的蓝色天际还是先前的模样。"
"These people must have come into sight as I fell asleep, and awakened me almost at once.","他们肯定是在我睡着以后才来的，而且很快就把我给吵醒了。"
"They waded breast-deep in the water, emerging, coming shoreward, a woman, with her hair coiled about her head, and in pursuit of her a man, graceful figures of black and silver, with a bright green surge flowing off from them, a pattering of flashing wavelets about them.","一男一女从齐胸深的水中朝岸上走来。盘着发的女人走在前面，男的在后面追着。两人的身段一黑一银，十分优美。一股明亮的绿色潮水流过，在他们周遭溅起朵朵浪花。"
"He smote the water and splashed it toward her, she retaliated, and then they were knee-deep, and then for an instant their feet broke the long silver margin of the sea.","男的朝那个女的击打着水，女的也迅速还击。少顷，他们岸边更近了，水只有齐膝深了。然后他们便上了岸，大海绵长的银色边界被他们的足迹割断。"
"Each wore a tightly fitting bathing dress that hid nothing of the shining, dripping beauty of their youthful forms.","他们俩穿这紧身的泳衣，闪闪发亮，还滴着水，挡不住年轻身躯散发的美感。"
"She glanced over her shoulder and found him nearer than she thought, started, gesticulated, gave a little cry that pierced me to the heart, and fled up the beach obliquely toward me, running like the wind, and passed me, vanished amidst the black distorted bushes, and was gone—she and her pursuer, in a moment, over the ridge of sand.","她回过头一看，发现他离自己如此之近，不由得轻声惊叫，手足无措，那声音刺痛我的心。她歪歪斜斜地朝我的方向飞奔而来，一阵风似地擦身而过，继而隐没在弯弯曲曲的黑色灌木丛中——很快，她和那个追她的人就越过了沙滩的隆起，消失在另一侧。"
"I heard him shout between exhaustion and laughter....","我听见了他疲惫而快乐的叫声……"
"And suddenly I was a thing of bestial fury, standing up with hands held up and clenched, rigid in gesture of impotent threatening, against the sky....","突然我像一头发狂的野兽般站了起来，面对天空高举双臂，紧握双拳，然而这样的威胁是多么无力……"
"For this striving, swift thing of light and beauty was Nettie—and this was the man for whom I had been betrayed!","因为这个飞奔而过的光彩耀人的美人就是妮蒂，而那个男人正是她为之背叛我的人。"
"And, it blazed upon me, I might have died there by the sheer ebbing of my will—unavenged!","我怒火中烧，差点儿就因为意志力衰竭而当场死在那儿——仇也报不成了！"
"In another moment I was running and stumbling, revolver in hand, in quiet unsuspected pursuit of them, through the soft and noiseless sand.","不过，很快我就挺过来了。我手里拿着左轮手枪，跌跌撞撞地跟在他们身后，走在细软的沙滩上，而他们毫无察觉。"
"Section 5","第五节"
"I came up over the little ridge and discovered the bungalow village I had been seeking, nestling in a crescent lap of dunes.","我越过那个沙丘的丘脊，发现我追寻的村子就在眼前，它就躺在一个月牙形的山坳里。"
"A door slammed, the two runners had vanished, and I halted staring.","一扇门“嘭”地关上了，两人飞跑进去消失在门后，我也就不再盯着看了。"
"There was a group of three bungalows nearer to me than the others.","离我较近的有三栋平房，这些房子靠得很近。"
"Into one of these three they had gone, and I was too late to see which.","他们俩跑进了其中的一栋，但是我没来得及看清楚到底是哪栋。"
"All had doors and windows carelessly open, and none showed a light.","三栋房子的门窗都随意开着，但是里面没有一丝光线。"
"This place, upon which I had at last happened, was a fruit of the reaction of artistic-minded and carelessly living people against the costly and uncomfortable social stiffness of the more formal seaside resorts of that time.","这个我无意间来到的地方，就是当时一些具备艺术头脑、生活随意的人们开辟出来的，与当时较为正式的海滨胜地形成对比。海滨胜地耗资巨大，而它的僵硬的社交气息让人觉得不自在。"
"It was, you must understand, the custom of the steam-railway companies to sell their carriages after they had been obsolete for a sufficient length of years, and some genius had hit upon the possibility of turning these into little habitable cabins for the summer holiday.","你要知道，使用蒸汽火车的铁路公司出售废弃多年的火车车厢是当时的惯例。一些天才的人突发奇想，将这些废弃车厢改造成可居住的小屋，供夏季度假之用。"
"The thing had become a fashion with a certain Bohemian-spirited class; they added cabin to cabin, and these little improvised homes, gaily painted and with broad verandas and supplementary leantos added to their accommodation, made the brightest contrast conceivable to the dull rigidities of the decorous resorts.","对于带有一定波希米亚情节的阶层来说，这种做法成了时尚。他们添置了一个又一个小房子。这些简易的小房子被粉刷得光鲜亮丽，还另外添置了宽敞的阳台，小房子一侧还另搭建了单坡屋顶的披棚。这些小房子与端庄却僵硬呆板的度假胜地形成鲜明对比。"
"Of course there were many discomforts in such camping that had to be faced cheerfully, and so this broad sandy beach was sacred to high spirits and the young.","当然这种宿营地还是有许多不尽如人意的地方，人们需要乐观面对。所以，这个宽阔的沙滩对那些兴致高昂的人和年轻人而言才最有神圣魅力。"
"Art muslin and banjoes, Chinese lanterns and frying, are leading “notes,” I find, in the impression of those who once knew such places well.","我发现，人们一旦熟知此地，他们脑海中印象最深的莫过于纱织艺术品、邦卓琴、中国灯笼和油炸小吃。"
"But so far as I was concerned this odd settlement of pleasure-squatters was a mystery as well as a surprise, enhanced rather than mitigated by an imaginative suggestion or so I had received from the wooden-legged man at Shaphambury.","但就我而言，在我想象力的作用下，抑或是在受到假肢老人的暗示之后，这个享乐者的乐园不仅令人惊异更令人感到神秘。"
"I saw the thing as no gathering of light hearts and gay idleness, but grimly—after the manner of poor men poisoned by the suppression of all their cravings after joy.","我认为这里不是轻松愉悦、快乐休闲的地方，而是残忍之地——因为我看到这里的穷人不得不压抑自己对欢乐的渴求，因而身心遭到毒害。"
"To the poor man, to the grimy workers, beauty and cleanness were absolutely denied; out of a life of greasy dirt, of muddied desires, they watched their happier fellows with a bitter envy and foul, tormenting suspicions.","对于穷人和苦着脸工作的员工，美丽和整洁根本不存在。他们带着满身油腻和尘土，满怀嫉妒、敌意和疑心，冷眼地看着周围比他们快乐的人们。"
"Fancy a world in which the common people held love to be a sort of beastliness, own sister to being drunk!...","你可以设想这样一个世界：普通人把爱看成是兽欲的发泄，自己的姐妹喝得酩酊大醉！……"
"There was in the old time always something cruel at the bottom of this business of sexual love.","在那些岁月，性爱交易的深处是某种残酷的现实。"
"At least that is the impression I have brought with me across the gulf of the great Change.","至少这是历经巨变后我脑海里留下的印象。"
"To succeed in love seemed such triumph as no other success could give, but to fail was as if one was tainted....","爱情的圆满似乎是无与伦比的成就，而爱情的失败则似乎会成为人污点……"
"I felt no sense of singularity that this thread of savagery should run through these emotions of mine and become now the whole strand of these emotions.","当时，我的情感中有一丝野蛮的狂热，并渐渐占了上风，对此，我也不觉得有何不妥。"
"I believed, and I think I was right in believing, that the love of all true lovers was a sort of defiance then, that they closed a system in each other’s arms and mocked the world without.","那时我相信——我当时也认为自己的观点是正确的——真爱是对世俗的蔑视，真爱的两个人，用自己的臂弯筑成他们自己的识解，并且以此嘲笑那些没有真爱的世人。"
"You loved against the world, and these two loved AT me.","你们不顾世俗相爱，而这两个人则不顾我的感受相爱。"
"They had their business with one another, under the threat of a watchful fierceness.","他们我行我素，而不知道有人怀着一腔怒火看着他们。"
"A sword, a sharp sword, the keenest edge in life, lay among their roses.","一把剑，一把锋利的剑——带着世间最为锋利的剑刃——藏在他们的玫瑰花间。"
"Whatever may be true of this for others, for me and my imagination, at any rate, it was altogether true.","对别人而言，这些可能不一定正确，但对我或我的想象来说，无论如何这都是千真万确的。"
"I was never for dalliance, I was never a jesting lover.","我向来反对逢场作戏，也不喜欢打情骂俏。"
"I wanted fiercely; I made love impatiently.","我有强烈的欲望，迫不及待想做爱。"
"Perhaps I had written irrelevant love-letters for that very reason; because with this stark theme I could not play...","或许正因为这个原因，我才会写些毫不相干的情书，因为我无法将这个严肃的事情当作儿戏……"
"The thought of Nettie’s shining form, of her shrinking bold abandon to her easy conqueror, gave me now a body of rage that was nearly too strong for my heart and nerves and the tense powers of my merely physical being.","想到妮蒂光彩照人的身段，想到她向那个轻易征服她的人投怀送抱，此刻我怒火中烧。这怒火如此强烈，我的心脏、我的神经、我虚弱的体力几乎无法承受。"
"I came down among the pale sand-heaps slowly toward that queer village of careless sensuality, and now within my puny body I was coldly sharpset for pain and death, a darkly gleaming hate, a sword of evil, drawn.","我从那堆苍白的沙堆间走下来，朝那个随意淫荡的奇怪村庄缓缓走去。此刻我羸弱的身躯冷冷地渴望着痛苦和死亡，憎恨滋生，罪恶之剑出了剑鞘。"
"Section 6","第六节"
"I halted, and stood planning what I had to do.","我停了下来，站着思考该怎么做。"
"Should I go to bungalow after bungalow until one of the two I sought answered to my rap?","我该一家家去敲门直到我找的那两个人来应门吗？"
"But suppose some servant intervened!","但，如果开门的是仆人呢？"
"Should I wait where I was—perhaps until morning—watching?","还是说我该待在这儿观望直到天明？"
"And meanwhile—","同时——"
"All the nearer bungalows were very still now.","此时附近的房子都静悄悄的。"
"If I walked softly to them, from open windows, from something seen or overheard, I might get a clue to guide me.","如果我轻轻走过去，从打开的窗户中偷看或偷听试试，说不定能得到些能指引我的线索。"
"Should I advance circuitously, creeping upon them, or should I walk straight to the door?","我是悄悄地迂回靠近他们还是径直走到门口呢？"
"It was bright enough for her to recognize me clearly at a distance of many paces.","这儿光线明亮，几十步之遥她都能准确认出我来。"
"The difficulty to my mind lay in this, that if I involved other people by questions, I might at last confront my betrayers with these others close about me, ready to snatch my weapon and seize my hands.","困扰我的难题是，如果我向旁人打听，那么最后面对背叛我的人时，可能会被这些人围住，他们随时准备夺走我的武器，绑住我的双手。"
"Besides, what names might they bear here?","况且，他们在这里会不会换了名字？"
"“Boom!”","“嘭！”"
"the sound crept upon my senses, and then again it came.","声音震耳欲聋，接着又是一声。"
"I turned impatiently as one turns upon an impertinence, and beheld a great ironclad not four miles out, steaming fast across the dappled silver, and from its funnels sparks, intensely red, poured out into the night.","我不耐烦地转过身，仿佛抗议别人的无礼举动。不到四英里处，一艘装甲舰正迅速驶过斑斓的银色浪花，通红的火花从炮筒中涌入夜空。"
"As I turned, came the hot flash of its guns, firing seaward, and answering this, red flashes and a streaming smoke in the line between sea and sky.","正当我转身之际，装甲舰的炮筒又朝海那边开火，发出炽热火光。随即，海天之间红光闪烁、硝烟弥漫。"
"So I remembered it, and I remember myself staring at it—in a state of stupid arrest.","这一切仍历历在目。我还记得当时自己看着这一幕时呆若木鸡的样子。"
"It was an irrelevance.","这一切都无关紧要。"
"What had these things to do with me?","和我有什么关系呢？"
"With a shuddering hiss, a rocket from a headland beyond the village leapt up and burst hot gold against the glare, and the sound of the third and fourth guns reached me.","伴着令人心惊胆战的“咝咝”声，村头那边一枚火箭跃起，在强光中爆发出金黄色火焰。耳边又传来第三声、第四声枪响。"
"The windows of the dark bungalows, one after another, leapt out, squares of ruddy brightness that flared and flickered and became steadily bright.","黑暗中的房子，窗户陆续打开。四四方方的窗户射出的光芒闪闪烁烁，而后稳定下来变得相当明亮。"
"Dark heads appeared looking seaward, a door opened, and sent out a brief lane of yellow to mingle and be lost in the comet’s brightness.","几颗黑色脑袋探出来望着海堤。一扇门开了，一道昏黄光线射出来，和彗星的光亮混合起来，随即被吞噬。"
"That brought me back to the business in hand.","我这才回过神来。"
"“Boom!","“嘭！"
"boom!”","嘭！”"
"and when I looked again at the great ironclad, a little torchlike spurt of flame wavered behind her funnels.","我再看那巨大的装甲舰时，发现火炬般的火焰在她那烟筒后摇摆。"
"I could hear the throb and clangor of her straining engines....","我能听到拉紧的引擎发动的铿锵声……"
"I became aware of the voices of people calling to one another in the village.","我听到村子里人们互相呼喊的声音。"
"A white-robed, hooded figure, some man in a bathing wrap, absurdly suggestive of an Arab in his burnous, came out from one of the nearer bungalows, and stood clear and still and shadowless in the glare.","从附近一个房子里走出来一个身着白色衣服、睡眼惺忪的身影，是个穿着浴袍的男人。从他的包头巾看来，此人定是个阿拉伯人。他在一旁静静站着，在彗星的光芒没有一丝影子。"
"He put his hands to shade his seaward eyes, and shouted to people within.","他把手掌放在额前望着海堤，还对屋子里的人大叫着。"
"The people within—MY people!","屋子里的人——我的人！"
"My fingers tightened on my revolver.","我握紧了手枪。"
"What was this war nonsense to me?","这战争与我何干？"
"I would go round among the hummocks with the idea of approaching the three bungalows inconspicuously from the flank.","我可能在沙丘间徘徊，想着如何悄无声息地从侧面靠近那三个房子。"
"This fight at sea might serve my purpose—except for that, it had no interest for me at all.","这场海战可能正帮了我个大忙——除此以外，我对它毫无兴趣。"
"Boom!","嘭！"
"boom!","嘭！"
"The huge voluminous concussions rushed past me, beat at my heart and passed.","强烈的震荡传来撞击我的心房然后消逝。"
"In a moment Nettie would come out to see.","妮蒂马上就会出来一探究竟的。"
"First one and then two other wrappered figures came out of the bungalows to join the first.","裹着衣服的身影，一个，接着又两个，从房子里走了出来，聚到最初那个人周围。"
"His arm pointed seaward, and his voice, a full tenor, rose in explanation.","他举起手臂指着海堤方向，提高声音——十足的男高音——在解释着什么。"
"I could hear some of the words.","我能听到一些。"
"“It’s a German!”","“那是个德国人！”"
"he said.","他说，"
"“She’s caught.”","“她被抓了。”"
"Some one disputed that, and there followed a little indistinct babble of argument.","有人质疑，然后传来了有点儿含混不清而喋喋不休的争论声。"
"I went on slowly in the circuit I had marked out, watching these people as I went.","我沿着我设定好的路线缓缓绕过去，边走边看着这些人。"
"They shouted together with such a common intensity of direction that I halted and looked seaward.","他们朝一个方向大声地叫着，于是我停了下来，朝海堤望去。"
"I saw the tall fountain flung by a shot that had just missed the great warship.","没有击中那个巨大战舰的炮火在海水里炸开，激起高高的水柱。"
"A second rose still nearer us, a third, and a fourth, and then a great uprush of dust, a whirling cloud, leapt out of the headland whence the rocket had come, and spread with a slow deliberation right and left.","炮弹在离我们更近的海面激起水柱，第二个、第三个、第四个。最后村头发射火箭的那个方向，一阵尘土向上飞起，伴随一团旋转的烟雾，缓缓向四处飘散。"
"Hard on that an enormous crash, and the man with the full voice leapt and cried, “Hit!”","紧接着一声巨大的撞击声，那个高音男人跳起来大叫：“击中啦！”"
"Let me see!","我想想！"
"Of course, I had to go round beyond the bungalows, and then come up towards the group from behind.","当然，我得绕过这些房子，然后从后面包抄他们。"
"A high-pitched woman’s voice called, “Honeymooners!","一个高嗓门的女人叫道：“度蜜月的！"
"honeymooners!","度蜜月的！"
"Come out and see!”","快出来看哪！”"
"Something gleamed in the shadow of the nearer bungalow, and a man’s voice answered from within.","近处一所房子的阴影处有东西在闪烁，一个男的在里面应了一声。"
"What he said I did not catch, but suddenly I heard Nettie calling very distinctly, “We’ve been bathing.”","我没听清他说的什么，但是突然间我分明听到妮蒂大声说：“我们还在洗澡呢。”"
"The man who had first come out shouted, “Don’t you hear the guns?","最先出来的那个男人叫道：“你们没听到枪声吗？”"
"They’re fighting—not five miles from shore.”","他们在交战呢——离岸边不到五英里。”"
"“Eh?”","“啊？”"
"answered the bungalow, and a window opened.","窗户打开了，里面的人应道。"
"“Out there!”","“就在那儿！”"
"I did not hear the reply, because of the faint rustle of my own movements.","我没听到回答，我走动时发出微弱的声音把那答话声淹没了。"
"Clearly these people were all too much occupied by the battle to look in my direction, and so I walked now straight toward the darkness that held Nettie and the black desire of my heart.","显然这些人都全神贯注地关注着战斗，根本无暇留意我这个方向。于是我径直朝那藏匿着妮蒂和我内心黑色欲望的暗处缓缓走去。"
"“Look!”","“看！”"
"cried some one, and pointed skyward.","一个人手指着天空大叫道。"
"I glanced up, and behold!","我抬头瞟了一眼，啊，看哪！"
"The sky was streaked with bright green trails.","天空中一道道明亮的绿光尾迹。"
"They radiated from a point halfway between the western horizon and the zenith, and within the shining clouds of the meteor a streaming movement had begun, so that it seemed to be pouring both westwardly and back toward the east, with a crackling sound, as though the whole heaven was stippled over with phantom pistol-shots.","这些绿色发光的线条从西边地平线和天穹之间中点的位置发散开来，在明亮的彗星云里面流动。看起来云团像是朝东西方向倾注，还伴随着噼噼啪啪的声响，似乎是幽灵用手枪将整个天际点缀了一番。"
"It seemed to me then as if the meteor was coming to help me, descending with those thousand pistols like a curtain to fend off this unmeaning foolishness of the sea.","看来，彗星似乎也来帮我了。它像是带了上千把手枪降临，像帘幕一般将海上那愚蠢无聊挡开。"
"“Boom!”","“嘭！”"
"went a gun on the big ironclad, and “boom!” and the guns of the pursuing cruisers flashed in reply.","那艘装甲巨舰传来一声炮响，接着又是一声“嘭”，追击的巡洋舰发射一连串炮弹反击。"
"To glance up at that streaky, stirring light scum of the sky made one’s head swim.","抬头看线状的光线残迹在空中流转，不由得头昏目眩。"
"I stood for a moment dazed, and more than a little giddy.","我呆立了一会儿，极其昏眩。"
"I had a curious instant of purely speculative thought.","突然我脑海闪现一个纯属猜测的怪念头。"
"Suppose, after all, the fanatics were right, and the world WAS coming to an end!","假若，最终真如狂热分子而言，世界即将毁灭！"
"What a score that would be for Parload!","对帕罗德而言，这是多大的成就啊！"
"Then it came into my head that all these things were happening to consecrate my revenge!","我思忖着，所有发生的这一切正巧助我复仇。"
"The war below, the heavens above, were the thunderous garment of my deed.","不论是地上的战斗还是天上的彗星，都极有力地掩盖我的行动。"
"I heard Nettie’s voice cry out not fifty yards away, and my passion surged again.","我听到妮蒂的叫喊声，就在五十码开外的地方，我再次心潮涌动。"
"I was to return to her amid these terrors bearing unanticipated death.","我要在这充满无法预期的死亡的恐惧中回到她身边。"
"I was to possess her, with a bullet, amidst thunderings and fear.","我要在这巨响和恐惧中用一颗子弹来拥有她。"
"At the thought I lifted up my voice to a shout that went unheard, and advanced now recklessly, revolver displayed in my hand.","这么想着我扯开嗓门吼了一声，但是没人听到，然后手握手枪不顾一切地冲上前去。"
"It was fifty yards, forty yards, thirty yards—the little group of people, still heedless of me, was larger and more important now, the green-shot sky and the fighting ships remoter.","五十码，四十码，三十码——那一小群人，依然没有注意到我。此刻他们离我越来越近，越来越关键，而被绿光笼罩的天空和战舰则越来越远。"
"Some one darted out from the bungalow, with an interrupted question, and stopped, suddenly aware of me.","房子突然冲出来一个人，问着什么。突然她停了下来，发现了我。"
"It was Nettie, with some coquettish dark wrap about her, and the green glare shining on her sweet face and white throat.","此人正是妮蒂。她穿着妖冶迷人的黑色浴袍，绿光照在她甜美的脸庞和白皙的脖颈上。"
"I could see her expression, stricken with dismay and terror, at my advance, as though something had seized her by the heart and held her still—a target for my shots.","我能看到她的表情，面对我的步步逼近，她惊恐万分。似乎有什么东西揪住了她的心使她动弹不得——正好为我的子弹提供了靶心！"
"“Boom!”","“嘭！”"
"came the ironclad’s gunshot like a command.","巨型装甲舰的炮声传来，像是一声命令。"
"“Bang!”","“砰！”"
"the bullet leapt from my hand.","子弹从我手中飞出。"
"Do you know, I did not want to shoot her then.","你们知道吗，那一刻我并不想杀她的。"
"Indeed I did not want to shoot her then!","真的，那时我根本不想杀她。"
"Bang!","砰！"
"and I had fired again, still striding on, and—each time it seemed I had missed.","我继续往前，又开了一枪——但似乎每次我都失手了。"
"She moved a step or so toward me, still staring, and then someone intervened, and near beside her I saw young Verrall.","她朝我走了一两步，依旧盯着我。这时跑来一个人站在她身边，正是小维罗尔。"
"A heavy stranger, the man in the hooded bath-gown, a fat, foreign-looking man, came out of nowhere like a shield before them.","一个大块头的陌生人，也就是那个穿着带帽浴袍、外国长相的男人，不知从哪里冒了出来，像盾一般挡在他们前面。"
"He seemed a preposterous interruption.","他就像个臃肿的障碍物。"
"His face was full of astonishment and terror.","他满脸惊恐。"
"He rushed across my path with arms extended and open hands, as one might try to stop a runaway horse.","他张开双臂和手掌冲出来挡住我的去路，像是要阻拦一匹脱缰的马。"
"He shouted some nonsense.","他胡乱喊着什么，"
"He seemed to want to dissuade me, as though dissuasion had anything to do with it now.","企图劝阻我，以为劝阻能起到什么作用。"
"“Not you, you fool!”","“你滚开，你这笨蛋！”"
"I said hoarsely.","我嘶叫道，"
"“Not you!”","“给我滚开！”"
"But he hid Nettie nevertheless.","但他还是护着妮蒂。"
"By an enormous effort I resisted a mechanical impulse to shoot through his fat body.","我竭力克制冲动，没有射穿这个肥胖的躯体。"
"Anyhow, I knew I mustn’t shoot him.","不知怎的，我知道我不能把他给杀了。"
"For a moment I was in doubt, then I became very active, turned aside abruptly and dodged his pawing arm to the left, and so found two others irresolutely in my way.","我迟疑了一会，然后迅速行动起来。我突然左转，躲过胡抓乱挠的手臂跳到左边，却又发现另外两个却毅然决然地挡着我的去路。"
"I fired a third shot in the air, just over their heads, and ran at them.","我朝上开了一枪，就在他们头顶，然后朝他们跑过去。"
"They hastened left and right; I pulled up and faced about within a yard of a foxy-faced young man coming sideways, who seemed about to grapple me.","他们一左一右迅速躲开；一码开外斜着冲出来一个满脸奸诈的年轻人，想要抓住我，我急忙停住。"
"At my resolute halt he fell back a pace, ducked, and threw up a defensive arm, and then I perceived the course was clear, and ahead of me, young Verrall and Nettie—he was holding her arm to help her—running away.","见我停住不动，他往后退了一步低下头，举起手臂防御。这时我发现道上没人了，前方小维罗尔正搀扶妮蒂逃窜。"
"“Of course!”","“果不其然！”"
"said I.","我说道。"
"I fired a fourth ineffectual shot, and then in an access of fury at my misses, started out to run them down and shoot them barrel to backbone.","我开了第四枪，又没击中。几次失手让我怒不可遏。我朝他们冲去，枪口瞄准他们的脊背。"
"“These people!”","“混蛋！”"
"I said, dismissing all these interferences....“A yard,” I panted, speaking aloud to myself, “a yard!","我叫道，把所有挡路的人都赶跑……“一码！”，我气喘吁吁地对自己说，“一码！"
"Till then, take care, you mustn’t—mustn’t shoot again.”","距离一码之前，注意，不能再开枪了。”"
"Some one pursued me, perhaps several people—I do not know, we left them all behind....","有人追我，许是好几个——我不知道，我们把他们甩在了身后……"
"We ran.","我们跑啊跑。"
"For a space I was altogether intent upon the swift monotony of flight and pursuit.","有一会儿，我的全部精力都集中在机械的逃窜和追赶上。"
"The sands were changed to a whirl of green moonshine, the air was thunder.","沙子成了一片混沌的绿色月光，空中雷声轰隆。"
"A luminous green haze rolled about us.","一团绿光烟雾包裹着我们。"
"What did such things matter?","这又如何？"
"We ran.","我们继续跑着。"
"Did I gain or lose?","我成功了还是失败了？"
"that was the question.","这才是问题的关键。"
"They ran through a gap in a broken fence that sprang up abruptly out of nothingness and turned to the right.","突然，不知道从哪里冒出来一个破篱笆，他们穿过篱笆中间的空隙，往右跑了。"
"I noted we were in a road.","这时，我发现，我们几个是在一条大路上。"
"But this green mist!","但怎么出现了绿色浓雾！"
"One seemed to plough through it.","我们似乎寸步难行！"
"They were fading into it, and at that thought I made a spurt that won a dozen feet or more.","他们就要消失在雾中了，于是我赶紧冲过去，追回十几英尺。"
"She staggered.","她跌倒了。"
"He gripped her arm, and dragged her forward.","他抓着她的胳膊，拖着她往前走。"
"They doubled to the left.","他们往左拐了。"
"We were off the road again and on turf.","我们又离开大道，来到一片草坪上。"
"It felt like turf.","感觉像是草坪的地方。"
"I tripped and fell at a ditch that was somehow full of smoke, and was up again, but now they were phantoms half gone into the livid swirls about me....","我跌了一跤，掉进一个满是烟雾的沟里。我再爬出去，此时他们已如幽灵般就要消失在我周围青色的漩涡中了……"
"Still I ran.","我继续跑。"
"On, on!","继续！继续！"
"I groaned with the violence of my effort.","我边拼命地跑边呻吟。"
"I staggered again and swore.","又趔趄了一下，我咒骂起来。"
"I felt the concussions of great guns tear past me through the murk.","我感觉到巨大的炮弹碎片引起的冲击穿过我的身体渗入到黑夜里。"
"They were gone!","他们不见了！"
"Everything was going, but I kept on running.","一切都在消失，而我继续奔跑着。"
"Once more I stumbled.","我又跌了一跤。"
"There was something about my feet that impeded me, tall grass or heather, but I could not see what it was, only this smoke that eddied about my knees.","脚下有什么东西缠绕着，是高茎草还是石楠花。我看不清到底是什么，只能看到在膝盖处盘旋的烟雾。"
"There was a noise and spinning in my brain, a vain resistance to a dark green curtain that was falling, falling, falling, fold upon fold.","我脑袋嗡嗡地响，感觉天旋地转，徒劳地想要拨开那下坠再下坠的深绿色幕帘，一层又一层。"
"Everything grew darker and darker.","一切变得愈来愈暗。"
"I made one last frantic effort, and raised my revolver, fired my penultimate shot at a venture, and fell headlong to the ground.","我慌乱地做了最后的努力，举起手枪，冒险射出了倒数第二发子弹，然后跌坐在地上。"
"And behold!","看哪！"
"the green curtain was a black one, and the earth and I and all things ceased to be.","绿色幕帘变成黑色的了，地球、我和所有的一切，就要毁灭了。"

"Section 1","第一节"
"I SEEMED to awaken out of a refreshing sleep.","我像是从沉睡中醒来，精神焕发。"
"I did not awaken with a start, but opened my eyes, and lay very comfortably looking at a line of extraordinarily scarlet poppies that glowed against a glowing sky.","我并非受惊扰而醒，而是自然地睁开眼，然后悠然地躺在那儿欣赏异常鲜红的罂粟花。花朵在绚烂的天空下愈发鲜艳夺目。"
"It was the sky of a magnificent sunrise, and an archipelago of gold-beached purple islands floated in a sea of golden green.","正是日出时分，天空美轮美奂。金绿色的海洋上漂浮着成群的紫色小岛，岛上是金色的沙滩。"
"The poppies too, swan-necked buds, blazing corollas, translucent stout seed-vessels, stoutly upheld, had a luminous quality, seemed wrought only from some more solid kind of light.","矗立的罂粟花也是金光闪闪——鹅颈式花蕾、火红的花冠和半透明紧实的果皮——仿佛这花是由某种更为缜密的光锻造而成的。"
"I stared unwonderingly at these things for a time, and then there rose upon my consciousness, intermingling with these, the bristling golden green heads of growing barley.","我长久而木然地注视着眼前的一切，这时我注意到了长势正旺的金绿色麦穗，它们和这一切混杂在一起。"
"A remote faint question, where I might be, drifted and vanished again in my mind.","我这是在哪儿？这个缥缈的问题在脑海一闪，马上又消逝了。"
"Everything was very still.","万籁俱寂。"
"Everything was as still as death.","所有一切都死一般地沉寂。"
"I felt very light, full of the sense of physical well-being.","我感觉十分轻松，周身畅快。"
"I perceived I was lying on my side in a little trampled space in a weedy, flowering barley field, that was in some inexplicable way saturated with light and beauty.","我发现自己侧躺在麦田里一小块被踏平的地方。麦田杂草丛生，鲜花烂漫，那种明亮和美丽简直无以言表。"
"I sat up, and remained for a long time filled with the delight and charm of the delicate little convolvulus that twined among the barley stems, the pimpernel that laced the ground below.","田地里满是海绿植物，小巧雅致的牵牛花缠绕着夹杂其间。我坐起来，久久沉浸在这美妙和欢快中。"
"Then that question returned.","这时，那个问题又回来了。"
"What was this place?","这是什么地方？"
"How had I come to be sleeping here?","我怎么会睡在这儿？"
"I could not remember.","我想不起来。"
"It perplexed me that somehow my body felt strange to me.","不知怎的，我的身体好像很陌生，对此我百思不得其解。"
"It was unfamiliar—I could not tell how—and the barley, and the beautiful weeds, and the slowly developing glory of the dawn behind; all those things partook of the same unfamiliarity.","感觉很不熟悉——我说不出来哪里不对劲——还有大麦、漂亮的野草和身后愈加绚丽的晨曦。然而这所有一切都掺杂着同样的陌生感。"
"I felt as though I was a thing in some very luminous painted window, as though this dawn broke through me.","我感觉自己像是置身于粉刷得明晃晃的窗户上的某个东西，似乎曙光正从我身上蔓延开来。"
"I felt I was part of some exquisite picture painted in light and joy.","我觉得自己像是一幅由光和喜悦绘制而成的精美图画中的一部分。"
"A faint breeze bent and rustled the barley-heads, and jogged my mind forward.","一阵微风拂过，麦穗弯下了腰发出沙沙的声响，将我的思绪往前推进。"
"Who was I?","我是谁？"
"That was a good way of beginning.","从这个问题入手应该是个不错的方法。"
"I held up my left hand and arm before me, a grubby hand, a frayed cuff; but with a quality of painted unreality, transfigured as a beggar might have been by Botticelli.","我抬起左手和手臂看了看，发现手很脏，袖口也磨掉了，但是由于色彩的非现实感，倒觉得自己像是波提塞利画中的乞丐。"
"I looked for a time steadfastly at a beautiful pearl sleeve-link.","我定定地看了许久那袖口上的一粒精美的珍珠纽扣。"
"I remembered Willie Leadford, who had owned that arm and hand, as though he had been some one else.","我想起了威利·利德福特。他的手臂和手掌就是这个样子，似乎感觉就像是换了个人似的。"
"Of course!","是的！"
"My history—its rough outline rather than the immediate past—began to shape itself in my memory, very small, very bright and inaccessible, like a thing watched through a microscope.","我的过去在我的脑海的慢慢成形——只是粗糙的轮廓而非清晰再现——细小明亮且不连贯，就像是从显微镜中看到的一般。"
"Clayton and Swathinglea returned to my mind; the slums and darkness, Dureresque, minute and in their rich dark colors pleasing, and through them I went towards my destiny.","我想起了克莱顿、斯沃星利，贫民窟和那里的暗无天日的日子，还有杜尔雷斯克。他们令人愉悦的黝黑脸庞浮现在脑海，我便想起了我的过往。"
"I sat hands on knees recalling that queer passionate career that had ended with my futile shot into the growing darkness of the End.","我将双手放在膝上，回想着我那段怪异又满是激情的历程。它在末日的黑暗里最后一声徒劳的枪响中结束了。"
"The thought of that shot awoke my emotions again.","想起那一枪，昔日的情感再次涌动。"
"There was something in it now, something absurd, that made me smile pityingly.","现在看来，那一枪显得有些滑稽了，这使得我不禁自嘲地笑了起来。"
"Poor little angry, miserable creature!","这可怜、愤怒、痛苦的小人物！"
"Poor little angry, miserable world!","这可怜、愤怒、痛苦的小世界！"
"I sighed for pity, not only pity for myself, but for all the hot hearts, the tormented brains, the straining, striving things of hope and pain, who had found their peace at last beneath the pouring mist and suffocation of the comet.","我哀怜地叹了口气，不仅为我自己，也为所有或满怀激情，或备受煎熬，或在希望与痛苦间挣扎的人们。在彗星的浓雾和令人窒息的笼罩下，他们终于找到了自身的平和。"
"Because certainly that world was over and done.","因为，毫无疑问，那个世界已经终结了。"
"They were all so weak and unhappy, and I was now so strong and so serene.","他们都如此孱弱而抑郁，但此刻我是如此强大且平静。"
"For I felt sure I was dead; no one living could have this perfect assurance of good, this strong and confident peace.","因为我确信我已死去。任何活着的人都不可能拥有这份对至善的完美把握、这份强大且自信的平和。"
"I had made an end of the fever called living.","我已经结束了对生的狂热。"
"I was dead, and it was all right, and these—?","我死了，这挺好的。那么这些又是什么呢？"
"I felt an inconsistency.","我觉得很矛盾。"
"These, then, must be the barley fields of God!—the still and silent barley fields of God, full of unfading poppy flowers whose seeds bear peace.","那么，这些一定是上帝的麦田！属于上帝的静谧麦田，还有不谢的罂粟花和它那孕育和平的种子。"
"Section 2","第二节"
"It was queer to find barley fields in heaven, but no doubt there were many surprises in store for me.","在天堂看到麦田，我很是惊奇。不过，一定还有更多的惊喜在等着我。"
"How still everything was!","万物多么宁静啊！"
"Peace!","和平！"
"The peace that passeth understanding.","这传递理解的和平！"
"After all it had come to me!","终于到来了！"
"But, indeed, everything was very still!","真的，一切都那么宁静！"
"No bird sang.","没有鸟声。"
"Surely I was alone in the world!","我独自一人在这儿！"
"No birds sang.","没有鸟鸣。"
"Yes, and all the distant sounds of life had ceased, the lowing of cattle, the barking of dogs....","是的，远方所有动物的声响都消逝了，不论是牛群的低哞，还是狗的狂吠……"
"Something that was like fear beatified came into my heart.","类似恐惧的东西在我心头滋生。"
"It was all right, I knew; but to be alone!","没关系的，我知道。但是，这儿只有我一个人！"
"I stood up and met the hot summons of the rising sun, hurrying towards me, as it were, with glad tidings, over the spikes of the barley....","我站起来迎接初升的太阳热烈的召唤。它带着喜讯越过麦穗向我奔来……"
"Blinded, I made a step.","我茫然地迈出一步。"
"My foot struck something hard, and I looked down to discover my revolver, a blue-black thing, like a dead snake at my feet.","脚碰到了什么硬物，我低头一看发现竟是我的左轮手枪，这个蓝黑色的东西，像死蛇一般蜷在我的脚边。"
"For a moment that puzzled me.","我愣了愣。"
"Then I clean forgot about it.","但马上我就将它抛诸脑后了。"
"The wonder of the quiet took possession of my soul.","这神奇的宁静占据了我整个心灵。"
"Dawn, and no birds singing!","黎明，却没有鸟鸣！"
"How beautiful was the world!","多么美妙的世界啊！"
"How beautiful, but how still!","如此美妙，可又如此寂静！"
"I walked slowly through the barley towards a line of elder bushes, wayfaring tree and bramble that made the hedge of the field.","我缓缓穿过麦田，朝着由一排老灌木和荆棘围成的篱笆走去。"
"I noted as I passed along a dead shrew mouse, as it seemed to me, among the haums; then a still toad.","沿路我发现了一只死老鼠躺在稻草堆里，然后是一只一动不动的青蛙。"
"I was surprised that this did not leap aside from my footfalls, and I stooped and picked it up.","我很惊奇它没有从我脚边跳开，于是便弯腰把它捡了起来。"
"Its body was limp like life, but it made no struggle, the brightness of its eye was veiled, it did not move in my hand.","它的躯体依然柔软，似乎还没有死。但它未作丝毫挣扎，眼睛像是蒙了一层纱不再明亮，在我掌中纹丝不动。"
"It seems to me now that I stood holding that lifeless little creature for some time.","现在想来，我那时似乎捧着那个毫无生气的小东西，站了好一会，"
"Then very softly I stooped down and replaced it.","之后我才弯下腰去轻轻地将它放回原处。"
"I was trembling—trembling with a nameless emotion.","我颤抖起来——因一种莫名的情愫。"
"I looked with quickened eyes closely among the barley stems, and behold, now everywhere I saw beetles, flies, and little creatures that did not move, lying as they fell when the vapors overcame them; they seemed no more than painted things.","我凑近麦秆，眼睛迅速在其间扫视，发现到处都是甲虫苍蝇之类的小东西。它们一动不动地躺在那儿，保持着被绿色气体袭击时倒下的状态，就像画中之物一般。"
"Some were novel creatures to me.","有些动物于我来说甚是新奇。"
"I was very unfamiliar with natural things.","因为我对自然界的事物知之甚少。"
"“My God!”","“天哪！”"
"I cried; “but is it only I—?”","我喊道，“难道只有我——”"
"And then at my next movement something squealed sharply.","我正要起身时，什么东西尖叫了一声。"
"I turned about, but I could not see it, only I saw a little stir in a rut and heard the diminishing rustle of the unseen creature’s flight.","我环顾了一下，没看到是什么东西，只看见犁沟里荡起的微波和那个不明动物飞走的渐远的声音。"
"And at that I turned to my toad again, and its eye moved and it stirred.","于是我又回过头来看我的青蛙，它眼睛动了动，身子抖了抖。"
"And presently, with infirm and hesitating gestures, it stretched its limbs and began to crawl away from me.","不久，它便颤颤巍巍小心翼翼地舒展四肢，从我身边爬开了。"
"But wonder, that gentle sister of fear, had me now.","此时，我却被恐惧的金兰姐妹——惊奇给擒住了。"
"I saw a little way ahead a brown and crimson butterfly perched upon a cornflower.","我看到前面不远处一直棕红花纹的蝴蝶停在一朵矢车菊上休憩。"
"I thought at first it was the breeze that stirred it, and then I saw its wings were quivering.","起先我以为是微风吹着它晃动，但稍后我却发现它的翅膀在颤动。"
"And even as I watched it, it started into life, and spread itself, and fluttered into the air.","我注视着它，发现它竟苏醒了。只见它舒展了身子便扇动翅膀飞到了空中。"
"I watched it fly, a turn this way, a turn that, until suddenly it seemed to vanish.","我看着它飞舞，忽左忽右，直到它忽地消失不见。"
"And now, life was returning to this thing and that on every side of me, with slow stretchings and bendings, with twitterings, with a little start and stir....","此时，身旁的小东西都渐渐活了过来，伸伸腿弯弯腰，带着些许惊奇和骚动，叽叽喳喳地闹了起来。"
"I came slowly, stepping very carefully because of these drugged, feebly awakening things, through the barley to the hedge.","我缓慢而谨慎地穿过麦田朝篱笆走去，生怕踩到了这些刚刚苏醒依旧睡意蒙眬的脆弱小生命。"
"It was a very glorious hedge, so that it held my eyes.","我目不转睛地看着这个华丽的篱笆。"
"It flowed along and interlaced like splendid music.","它想华丽的乐章般流淌着、交织着。"
"It was rich with lupin, honeysuckle, campions, and ragged robin; bed straw, hops, and wild clematis twined and hung among its branches, and all along its ditch border the starry stitchwort lifted its childish faces, and chorused in lines and masses.","篱笆上满是白羽扇豆、忍冬、布谷鸟和翦秋罗，猪猪殃殃草在篱笆的枝条上缠扰悬挂。水渠边上星星点点的刺草一行行，一堆堆，都抬起孩子般的面孔纵情歌唱。"
"Never had I seen such a symphony of note-like flowers and tendrils and leaves.","我从未见过这样一种由音符般的花朵、花须和叶子组成的交响乐。"
"And suddenly in its depths, I heard a chirrup and the whirr of startled wings.","突然这间，我听到乐曲深处传来鸟儿惊起的翅膀扇动的声音。"
"Nothing was dead, but everything had changed to beauty!","一切都还活着，而且变美了！"
"And I stood for a time with clean and happy eyes looking at the intricate delicacy before me and marveling how richly God has made his worlds.....","我杵在那里好一会儿，眼前美妙绝伦的景色令我心旷神怡，我不由得感叹造如此物主将他的世界造就得丰富多彩……"
"“Tweedle-Tweezle,” a lark had shot the stillness with his shining thread of song; one lark, and then presently another, invisibly in the air, making out of that blue quiet a woven cloth of gold....","“嘀啾嘀啾，”一只云雀金线般的歌喉穿透这片沉寂。一只，紧接着又一只。它们消失在空中，只在蓝色静谧的天空里用金线般的歌喉织出一块金色的布匹。"
"The earth recreated—only by the reiteration of such phrases may I hope to give the intense freshness of that dawn.","地球重造了——我只有重复这句话才有可能描述那个全新的黎明。"
"For a time I was altogether taken up with the beautiful details of being, as regardless of my old life of jealous passion and impatient sorrow as though I was Adam new made.","一时间，我彻底沉浸在各种美丽的生灵中，全然忘却了我过去那充斥着嫉妒的激情和躁动的悲伤的生命，仿佛我是新生的亚当。"
"I could tell you now with infinite particularity of the shut flowers that opened as I looked, of tendrils and grass blades, of a blue-tit I picked up very tenderly—never before had I remarked the great delicacy of feathers—that presently disclosed its bright black eye and judged me, and perched, swaying fearlessly, upon my finger, and spread unhurried wings and flew away, and of a great ebullition of tadpoles in the ditch; like all the things that lived beneath the water, they had passed unaltered through the Change.","花苞——我目睹了它们的开放。花须，草叶，我轻轻捡起的蓝色山雀——我从未注意到原来羽毛竟然如此精美——它马上睁开了黑亮的眼睛打量我，栖在我的手指上无畏地晃来晃去，然后不慌不忙地张开双翅飞走了。沟渠里吐着气泡的成群蝌蚪——它们如其他水中生物一样，丝毫未受这场巨变的影响。这些事物的不确定特征，现在我能够向你们娓娓道来。"
"Amid such incidents, I lived those first great moments, losing for a time in the wonder of each little part the mighty wonder of the whole.","在这些林林总总的事物中我体会着最初的美妙时刻，久久地沉浸在大自然各微小事物蕴藏着的瑰丽奇妙。"
"A little path ran between hedge and barley, and along this, leisurely and content and glad, looking at this beautiful thing and that, moving a step and stopping, then moving on again, I came presently to a stile, and deep below it, and overgrown, was a lane.","篱笆和麦田之间有条小路。我沿着它信步走着，悠然自得地看着周围美妙的事物，走走停停，停停走走，不觉来到一扇栅门前，栅门后是藏着一条杂草丛生的小径。"
"And on the worn oak of the stile was a round label, and on the label these words, “Swindells’ G 90 Pills.”","橡木栅门上有一块圆形的标牌，上面写着：“斯温德尔斯的G90药片”。"
"I sat myself astraddle on the stile, not fully grasping all the implications of these words.","我跨坐在栅门上，没完全明白那些字是什么意思。"
"But they perplexed me even more than the revolver and my dirty cuff.","但是它们比左轮手枪和我的脏袖口更让我迷惑不解。"
"About me now the birds lifted up their little hearts and sang, ever more birds and more.","周围的鸟儿情绪高涨，纵情高歌起来，接着越来越多的鸟儿加入了这个行列。"
"I read the label over and over again, and joined it to the fact that I still wore my former clothes, and that my revolver had been lying at my feet.","我反复读着标牌，并将其与这两件事联系起来：我依然穿着的先前的衣服；左轮手枪曾躺在我脚边。"
"One conclusion stared out at me.","一个结论在脑海闪现。"
"This was no new planet, no glorious hereafter such as I had supposed.","这不是什么全新的地球，也没有我预想的灿烂前景。"
"This beautiful wonderland was the world, the same old world of my rage and death!","这美丽仙境依然是那个世界，那个我为之愤怒并死去的旧世界。"
"But at least it was like meeting a familiar house-slut, washed and dignified, dressed in a queen’s robes, worshipful and fine....","但至少，我像是遇见了一个熟识的妓女。她梳洗一新，摆出高贵的样子，然后穿上女王的长袍，无可挑剔、令人膜拜……"
"It might be the old world indeed, but something new lay upon all things, a glowing certitude of health and happiness.","这可能确实是原来的旧世界，但万物之上覆盖了新的东西——对健康快乐的热情洋溢的确信。"
"It might be the old world, but the dust and fury of the old life was certainly done.","这可能是旧世界，但是旧生命的尘埃和愤怒已然消逝。"
"At least I had no doubt of that.","至少，我对此深信不疑。"
"I recalled the last phases of my former life, that darkling climax of pursuit and anger and universal darkness and the whirling green vapors of extinction.","我回想起旧生命的最后阶段，那黯然的极限追踪和愤怒，还有举世的黑暗和毁灭一切的旋转绿色雾霭。"
"The comet had struck the earth and made an end to all things; of that too I was assured.","彗星撞击力地球并且终结了一切。对此我也深信不疑。"
"But afterward?...","但之后怎么了呢？"
"And now?","现在又是怎么回事儿？"
"The imaginations of my boyhood came back as speculative possibilities.","童年时代的想象成了现在各种推测的可能。"
"In those days I had believed firmly in the necessary advent of a last day, a great coming out of the sky, trumpetings and fear, the Resurrection, and the Judgment.","那时候，我坚信末日必将出现。烈日当空、呼号、恐惧、还有复活和审判。"
"My roving fancy now suggested to me that this Judgment must have come and passed.","我天马行空的幻想提示我，这场审判一定已到来并已经结束了。"
"That it had passed and in some manner missed me.","这场审判到来了，但是却不知为何漏掉了我。"
"I was left alone here, in a swept and garnished world (except, of course, for this label of Swindells’) to begin again perhaps....","我被孤零零地留在这儿，留在这个被清扫干净焕然一新的世界（当然，除了那个斯温德尔斯的标牌），重新开始……"
"No doubt Swindells has got his deserts.","无疑斯温德尔斯已经得到他应得的赏罚了。"
"My mind ran for a time on Swindells, on the imbecile pushfulness of that extinct creature, dealing in rubbish, covering the country-side with lies in order to get—what had he sought?","我思索着斯温德尔斯，思索着这个已然消逝的人的愚蠢和鲁莽。他经营废品，为了得到他想要的东西，他撒下弥天大谎——他追求什么呢？"
"—a silly, ugly, great house, a temper-destroying motor-car, a number of disrespectful, abject servants; thwarted intrigues for a party-fund baronetcy as the crest of his life, perhaps.","一座粗俗丑陋的大房子，一辆让人火光的汽车，一群无礼鄙俗的仆人，或许，还有一个未遂的阴谋，这个阴谋为的是争得一个党派基金男爵头衔，来装点他的人生。"
"You cannot imagine the littleness of those former times; their naive, queer absurdities!","你无法想象先前那个时代是多么渺小，多么无知，多么荒谬！"
"And for the first time in my existence I thought of these things without bitterness.","我生平第一次，不含丝毫苦涩地回想着这些东西。"
"In the former days I had seen wickedness, I had seen tragedy, but now I saw only the extraordinary foolishness of the old life.","过去的岁月里，我看到的是邪恶与悲剧。但现在，我看到的只是过去那无比的愚蠢。"
"The ludicrous side of human wealth and importance turned itself upon me, a shining novelty, poured down upon me like the sunrise, and engulfed me in laughter.","人类财富和自身重要性的荒诞面呈现在我眼前，如此闪亮、新奇，它曙光般倾泻下来将我掩盖，继而在笑声将我淹没。"
"Swindells!","斯温德尔斯！"
"Swindells, damned!","该死的斯温德尔斯！"
"My vision of Judgment became a delightful burlesque.","我的末日审判图景成了一出欢快的滑稽剧。"
"I saw the chuckling Angel sayer with his face veiled, and the corporeal presence of Swindells upheld amidst the laughter of the spheres.","我看到蒙着面纱的天使低声笑着，还有满堂大笑声中的斯温德尔斯的肉体。"
"“Here’s a thing, and a very pretty thing, and what’s to be done with this very pretty thing?”","“这有个东西，一个相当漂亮的东西，我们该如何处置它呢？”"
"I saw a soul being drawn from a rotund, substantial-looking body like a whelk from its shell....","于是我便看到灵魂从这个浑圆结实的躯体中被抽离出来，恰如田螺肉从壳里被剥出来一样。"
"I laughed loudly and long.","我大笑起来，久久不能停止。"
"And behold!","噢，看哪！"
"even as I laughed the keen point of things accomplished stabbed my mirth, and I was weeping, weeping aloud, convulsed with weeping, and the tears were pouring down my face.","即便我在笑，那些被抽离的灵魂的锋利尖端刺向我的欢乐，于是我号啕大哭起来，苦得全身抽搐，泪水顺着我的脸颊喷涌而出。"
"Section 3","第三节"
"Everywhere the awakening came with the sunrise.","每一处都伴随日出而苏醒。"
"We awakened to the gladness of the morning; we walked dazzled in a light that was joy.","我们在清晨的愉悦中醒来，漫步在令人眩晕的欢乐之光中。"
"Everywhere that was so.","每个地方都是如此。"
"It was always morning.","总是在清晨醒来。"
"It was morning because, until the direct rays of the sun touched it, the changing nitrogen of our atmosphere did not pass into its permanent phase, and the sleepers lay as they had fallen.","总是在清晨醒来时，因为，我们大气中不断变化的氮气只有在阳光直射下才会进入到永久稳定状态。在此之前，所有沉睡的生灵都不会醒来。"
"In its intermediate state the air hung inert, incapable of producing either revival or stupefaction, no longer green, but not yet changed to the gas that now lives in us....","在变化的中间阶段，空气很不活泼，无法使事物苏醒或麻痹，也不再是绿色，但还没变化至当前我们体内气体的状态。"
"To every one, I think, came some parallel to the mental states I have already sought to describe—a wonder, an impression of joyful novelty.","我觉得，对每个人而言，我努力描述的过程其实类似于心理状态的变化——一个奇迹、一种欢乐新奇的印象。"
"There was also very commonly a certain confusion of the intelligence, a difficulty in self-recognition.","当然一定的智力混乱和自我认知的困难也普遍存在。"
"I remember clearly as I sat on my stile that presently I had the clearest doubts of my own identity and fell into the oddest metaphysical questionings.","我清晰地记得，我一跨上栅门便怀疑起自己的身份，并且陷入了最古怪的形而上的质问中。"
"“If this be I,” I said, “then how is it I am no longer madly seeking Nettie?","“如果这是我，”我自言自语道，“我不再疯狂地寻找妮蒂了，这是怎么回事儿呢？"
"Nettie is now the remotest thing—and all my wrongs.","现在，妮蒂是最遥远的事物——一切都是我的错。"
"Why have I suddenly passed out of all that passion?","为什么我会突然之间走出那段感情？"
"Why does not the thought of Verrall quicken my pulses?”...","为什么想到维罗尔时，我的脉搏不再加速了呢？”"
"I was only one of many millions who that morning had the same doubts.","在那个清晨，千百万的人都怀有同样的疑惑，我只是其中之一。"
"I suppose one knows one’s self for one’s self when one returns from sleep or insensibility by the familiarity of one’s bodily sensations, and that morning all our most intimate bodily sensations were changed.","我以为人们从睡梦中或昏迷中醒来时是通过熟悉的肢体感觉来实现自我认知的。而那个早晨，所有我们极为熟知的肢体感觉却完全变了。"
"The intimate chemical processes of life were changed, its nervous metaboly.","生命根本的化学变化过程——神经系统的新陈代谢——发生了变化。"
"For the fluctuating, uncertain, passion-darkened thought and feeling of the old time came steady, full-bodied, wholesome processes.","过去波动不定、抑郁沮丧的想法和感觉都变得稳定、充实并且健康。"
"Touch was different, sight was different, sound and all the senses were subtler; had it not been that our thought was steadier and fuller, I believe great multitudes of men would have gone mad.","触觉、视觉都变得迥异，听觉等所有感官都更加敏锐。若不是因为我们的思想更为稳定和完满，我想许多人都已经疯了。"
"But, as it was, we understood.","然而，事实说明，我们理解了这场巨变。"
"The dominant impression I would convey in this account of the Change is one of enormous release, of a vast substantial exaltation.","讲述这场巨变的过程中，我所要表述的最主要印象，是一种极度的释放，是一种普遍的狂喜。"
"There was an effect, as it were, of light-headedness that was also clear-headedness, and the alteration in one’s bodily sensations, instead of producing the mental obfuscation, the loss of identity that was a common mental trouble under former conditions, gave simply a new detachment from the tumid passions and entanglements of the personal life.","巨变后，人们不仅身体轻快，头脑也很清晰。肢体感觉的变化并未产生精神上的困惑——虽然这种变化导致个体身份意识丧失是很普遍的心理问题——而只是将人们从膨胀的情感和个人生活的纠葛中抽离出来。"
"In this story of my bitter, restricted youth that I have been telling you, I have sought constantly to convey the narrowness, the intensity, the confusion, muddle, and dusty heat of the old world.","我已经向你们讲述了我那苦涩、饱受桎梏的青年时代。在讲述那个时候的故事时，我总是致力于传达旧世界的狭隘、紧张、困惑、纷乱，还有灰尘弥漫的炙热。"
"It was quite clear to me, within an hour of my awakening, that all that was, in some mysterious way, over and done.","醒来后不到一个小时，我就清晰地意识到，那些东西都以某种神秘的方式消失了。"
"That, too, was the common experience.","那也是人们的普遍感受。"
"Men stood up; they took the new air into their lungs—a deep long breath, and the past fell from them; they could forgive, they could disregard, they could attempt....","人们站起来，将新的空气吸入到肺部——一口长长的气，而后过去的记忆退去。他们可以原谅，可以漠视，可以尝试……"
"And it was no new thing, no miracle that sets aside the former order of the world.","消解世界旧秩序的不是什么新事物，也不是什么奇迹。"
"It was a change in material conditions, a change in the atmosphere, that at one bound had released them.","这事物只是由于物质条件和大气的改变，从而使之得以释放。"
"Some of them it had released to death....","也有些人因这一释放而死去。"
"Indeed, man himself had changed not at all.","事实上，人类本身并没有发生任何变化。"
"We knew before the Change, the meanest knew, by glowing moments in ourselves and others, by histories and music and beautiful things, by heroic instances and splendid stories, how fine mankind could be, how fine almost any human being could upon occasion be; but the poison in the air, its poverty in all the nobler elements which made such moments rare and remarkable—all that has changed.","在巨变发生之前，从我们自身或他人身上的闪光点中，从历史、音乐和其他美好事物中，从英雄事迹和辉煌壮丽的故事中，我们就已知道，羞愧地知道，人类可以多么美好，我们每个人在特殊时刻都可以多么高尚。但是空气中的毒素和所有崇高因素中的劣质成分使得人类的美好高尚变得如此罕见、如此异乎寻常——现在一切都变了。"
"The air was changed, and the Spirit of Man that had drowsed and slumbered and dreamt dull and evil things, awakened, and stood with wonder-clean eyes, refreshed, looking again on life.","空气变了，从而使曾经昏然沉迷于无聊邪恶之事的人类清醒过来。他们站了起来，容光焕发，并用无限明亮的双眼，重新看待生活。"
"Section 4","第四节"
"The miracle of the awakening came to me in solitude, the laughter, and then the tears.","我独自一人在荒郊野外奇迹般醒来，先是大笑，然后又大哭。"
"Only after some time did I come upon another man.","过了好一会儿我才遇上另外一个人。"
"Until I heard his voice calling I did not seem to feel there were any other people in the world.","听到他的呼喊声我才感觉到世界上还有其他人存在。"
"All that seemed past, with all the stresses that were past.","所有一切似乎都伴随着紧张的消失而不复存在。"
"I had come out of the individual pit in which my shy egotism had lurked, I had overflowed to all humanity, I had seemed to be all humanity; I had laughed at Swindells as I could have laughed at myself, and this shout that came to me seemed like the coming of an unexpected thought in my own mind.","我已跳出隐伏着我那胆怯的自我中心的个人的坑，我满心仁慈，似乎我就是仁慈本身；我像嘲笑自己一样嘲笑过斯温德尔斯。传来的喊叫声就像是我心中未料到的想法一样。"
"But when it was repeated I answered.","当呼叫声再次传来，我应了。"
"“I am hurt,” said the voice, and I descended into the lane forthwith, and so came upon Melmount sitting near the ditch with his back to me.","“我受伤了。”那人说道。于是我迅速走下那条小径，发现梅尔蒙特背对着我坐在沟渠旁。"
"Some of the incidental sensory impressions of that morning bit so deeply into my mind that I verily believe, when at last I face the greater mysteries that lie beyond this life, when the things of this life fade from me as the mists of the morning fade before the sun, these irrelevant petty details will be the last to leave me, will be the last wisps visible of that attenuating veil.","那天早上的一些偶然的感官印象是如此刻骨铭心，以至于我坚信，当我最后面对生命之外更为神秘的事物，或者当我这一生如晨雾在阳光中消散一样逝去时，这些毫不相关、微不足道的小事会伴我走到最后，会成为生命之面纱最后可见的几缕丝线。"
"I believe, for instance, I could match the fur upon the collar of his great motoring coat now, could paint the dull red tinge of his big cheek with his fair eyelashes just catching the light and showing beyond.","例如，我相信我现在还能够回忆起他用于驾车时穿的大衣外套的毛领，还能描绘他大大的脸颊上的暗红色彩和因吸收和反射太阳光而呈金黄色的睫毛。"
"His hat was off, his dome-shaped head, with its smooth hair between red and extreme fairness, was bent forward in scrutiny of his twisted foot.","他没戴帽子，红棕色的头发很顺滑，圆圆的脑袋前倾着，正仔细地端详着他扭伤的脚。"
"His back seemed enormous.","他的脊背似乎很宽。"
"And there was something about the mere massive sight of him that filled me with liking.","这宽大的身影中有些什么东西让我很喜欢。"
"“What’s wrong?”","“怎么了？”"
"said I.","我问道。"
"“I say,” he said, in his full deliberate tones, straining round to see me and showing a profile, a well-modeled nose, a sensitive, clumsy, big lip, known to every caricaturist in the world, “I’m in a fix.","“我是说，”他不慌不忙地说道，一边吃力转过头来看我，我便看到了他的侧脸——高挺的鼻梁、性感而笨拙的大嘴巴，这对世界上任何一个漫画家来说都不陌生，“我动不了了。"
"I fell and wrenched my ankle.","我摔倒了，扭伤了脚踝。"
"Where are you?”","你在哪儿？”"
"I walked round him and stood looking at his face.","我绕过去走到他前面，盯着他的脸。"
"I perceived he had his gaiter and sock and boot off, the motor gauntlets had been cast aside, and he was kneading the injured part in an exploratory manner with his thick thumbs.","他把绑腿、袜子和马靴都脱了，骑车用的防护手套也丢在一边。他正用粗壮的大拇指试探性地揉捏着受伤的部位。"
"“By Jove!”","“天哪！”"

"I had never met a man of this sort before; I did not know such men existed....","我从来没有遇到过这样的人，我不知道世上还有这样的人……"
"It is a curious thing, that I cannot now recall any ideas whatever that I had before the Change about the personalities of statesmen, but I doubt if ever in those days I thought of them at all as tangible individual human beings, conceivably of some intellectual complexity.","巨变前我是如何看待政客的，此时我完全想不起来了，这真是怪事。但我怀疑那时候我是否曾将政客们视作有形的个体，能够进行复杂的思维并令人信服的个体。"

"My inflamed, my rancid egotism—or was it after all only the chances of life?—had never once permitted that before the Change.","巨变之前，我那膨胀腐朽的自傲自大从未允许过这种卑贱感觉——或者那只是生活中偶然出现的事件？"

"Section 5","第五节"
"That memory stands out against the dark past of the world with extraordinary clearness and brightness.","过去的世界一片黑暗，而我的记忆却异常清晰鲜明。"
"The air, I remember, was full of the calling and piping and singing of birds.","我记得空中到处都能听到鸟儿啼啭歌唱的声音。"
"I have a curious persuasion too that there was a distant happy clamor of pealing bells, but that I am half convinced is a mistake.","另一个令人奇怪的事是，我似乎听到了远处传来的欢快喧闹的钟声。然而我又觉得那或许只是错觉。"
"Nevertheless, there was something in the fresh bite of things, in the dewy newness of sensation that set bells rejoicing in one’s brain.","不过，初生的事物和全新的感官中似乎含有某种东西。它使人兴奋不已，像是给大脑装了欢快的铃铛。"
"And that big, fair, pensive man sitting on the ground had beauty even in his clumsy pose, as though indeed some Great Master of strength and humor had made him.","而那个坐在地上沉思的高大的金发男人，尽管姿势笨拙，却仍散发着美感。似乎他是由某个力量与幽默的大师造就的。"
"And—it is so hard now to convey these things—he spoke to me, a stranger, without reservations, carelessly, as men now speak to men.","他毫无保留、毫无心机地向我，一个陌生人，讲述他的事情，就如同现在的人们相互交流。如今我很难将这些境况表达清楚。"
"Before those days, not only did we think badly, but what we thought, a thousand short-sighted considerations, dignity, objective discipline, discretion, a hundred kindred aspects of shabbiness of soul, made us muffle before we told it to our fellow-men.","此前，人们不仅心怀叵测，而且人们的所思所想——无数目光短浅的顾虑、尊严、客观限制、谨慎，和龌龊心灵的方方面面——使得彼此交谈起来蔵藏掖掖，根本无法开诚布公。"
"“It’s all returning now,” he said, and told me half soliloquizingly what was in his mind.","“现在我全想起来了，”他说，然后半自言自语地说出了他心中所想。"
"I wish I could give every word he said to me; he struck out image after image to my nascent intelligence, with swift broken fragments of speech.","我希望我能一字不落地转述他所说的话，他迅速而残缺的话语在我初醒的脑海中形成一幅幅画面。"
"If I had a precise full memory of that morning I should give it you, verbatim, minutely.","如果我能够完整地回忆起那个早晨的点点滴滴，我一定会完整详细地告诉你。"
"But here, save for the little sharp things that stand out, I find only blurred general impressions.","但是，现在除了一些印象深刻点的零碎片段，脑海里只留下笼统模糊的印象了。"
"Throughout I have to make up again his half-forgotten sentences and speeches, and be content with giving you the general effect.","我始终得重新拼凑他残缺不全的话语，能给你们一个大致的印象，我也十分满足。"
"But I can see and hear him now as he said, “The dream got worst at the end.","而他下面这段话，我仍记得十分清楚：“这场梦最后变得无法收场。"
"The war—a perfectly horrible business!","战争——真是极其可怕的交易！"
"Horrible!","可怕！"
"And it was just like a nightmare, you couldn’t do anything to escape from it—every one was driven!”","它就像梦魇，任何人都无力逃开——每一个人都在噩梦中煎熬。”"
"His sense of indiscretion was gone.","他的话语中不再有轻率之感。"
"He opened the war out to me—as every one sees it now.","他在我眼前摊开了战争的画卷——正如现在的人们所看到的一样。"
"Only that morning it was astonishing.","那个早晨，战争听起来是如此骇人。"
"He sat there on the ground, absurdly forgetful of his bare and swollen foot, treating me as the humblest accessory and as altogether an equal, talking out to himself the great obsessions of his mind.","他坐在地上，竟然忘记了那只赤裸红肿的脚。他视我为最谦卑的伙伴，同时又视我为同伴，向我倾诉他心中的苦闷："
"“We could have prevented it!","“我们本可以避免这场战争的！"
"Any of us who chose to speak out could have prevented it.","要是我们之中有哪怕一个人站出来，这场战争就可以避免的。"
"A little decent frankness.","只要些许体面的坦诚就可以。"
"What was there to prevent us being frank with one another?","是什么让我们无法坦诚相待？"
"Their emperor—his position was a pile of ridiculous assumptions, no doubt, but at bottom—he was a sane man.”","他们的君主——这个位置无疑是由荒谬的假设堆砌而来，但归根结底——他只是个凡人。”"
"He touched off the emperor in a few pithy words, the German press, the German people, and our own.","他简明扼要地评述了德国和我国的君主、媒体以及两国人民。"
"He put it as we should put it all now, but with a certain heat as of a man half guilty and wholly resentful.","我们现在对那一切的评价也不过如他所说。但是他的话语却带着半分的愧疚和十分的厌恶。"
"“Their damned little buttoned-up professors!”","“那些德国的混蛋教授！”"
"he cried, incidentally.","他突然大叫道，"
"“Were there ever such men?","“怎么会有这样的人呢？"
"And ours!","我们国家的那些也是一样！"
"Some of us might have taken a firmer line....","我们有些人本来可以坚持反战的……"
"If a lot of us had taken a firmer line and squashed that nonsense early....”","如果我们大多数人都坚持反战，开始就堵住那些胡说八道的教授们的嘴……”"
"He lapsed into inaudible whisperings, into silence....","慢慢地他陷入低语，最后沉默……"
"I stood regarding him, understanding him, learning marvelously from him.","我站在那儿看着他，理解他，无比惊奇地向他学习。"
"It is a fact that for the best part of the morning of the Change I forgot Nettie and Verrall as completely as though they were no more than characters in some novel that I had put aside to finish at my leisure, in order that I might talk to this man.","而巨变带给我最好的事物是，那个早晨我几乎没有想起妮蒂和维罗尔，他们就像是小说里的人物一般被我搁置一旁，待闲暇之时再去理会，以便能有时间与这个男人交谈。"
"“Eh, well,” he said, waking startingly from his thoughts.","“嗯，呃，”他从思绪中惊醒，说道，"
"“Here we are awakened!","“我们现在都清醒了！"
"The thing can’t go on now; all this must end.","战争不能再继续了，一切都该结束了。"
"How it ever began—!","它到底是怎么开始的——！"
"My dear boy, how did all those things ever begin?","兄弟，这一切到底是怎么开始的？"
"I feel like a new Adam....","我感觉像是亚当再生……"
"Do you think this has happened—generally?","大体说来，你觉得这是真的吗？"
"Or shall we find all these gnomes and things?...","或者我们该去找找这些侏儒们？"
"Who cares?”","谁在乎呢？”"
"He made as if to rise, and remembered his ankle.","他像是要起身，忽又想起了受伤的脚踝。"
"He suggested I should help him as far as his bungalow.","于是他便请我扶他到他的小平房去。"
"There seemed nothing strange to either of us that he should requisition my services or that I should cheerfully obey.","不论是他要求我帮忙，还是我欣然允诺，在我们俩看来这都是理所当然的事情。"
"I helped him bandage his ankle, and we set out, I his crutch, the two of us making up a sort of limping quadruped, along the winding lane toward the cliffs and the sea.","我帮他包扎好脚踝便搀扶着他沿着蜿蜒的小路跌跌撞撞朝着悬崖和海边走去。"
"Section 6","第六节"
"His bungalow beyond the golf links was, perhaps, a mile and a quarter from the lane.","他的平房在高尔夫球场那边，离这条小路大概一又四分之一英里远。"
"We went down to the beach margin and along the pallid wave-smoothed sands, and we got along by making a swaying, hopping, tripod dance forward until I began to give under him, and then, as soon as we could, sitting down.","我们来到海边，在因破浪冲刷而平滑的苍凉的沙滩上，摇摇晃晃步履蹒跚地往前跛行，直到我实在撑不住了才停下来休息。"
"His ankle was, in fact, broken, and he could not put it to the ground without exquisite pain.","他的脚踝实际上已经骨折了，脚一放到地上就钻心地疼。"
"So that it took us nearly two hours to get to the house, and it would have taken longer if his butler-valet had not come out to assist me.","因此我们花了近两个小时才到达他的平房。如果不是他的管家仆人出来帮忙，恐怕要花更长时间。"
"They had found motor-car and chauffeur smashed and still at the bend of the road near the house, and had been on that side looking for Melmount, or they would have seen us before.","他们在房子附近那条路的转弯口发现了被撞得粉碎的汽车和司机，于是一直在那边寻找梅尔蒙特，否则他们早就看到我们了。"
"For most of that time we were sitting now on turf, now on a chalk boulder, now on a timber groin, and talking one to the other, with the frankness proper to the intercourse of men of good intent, without reservations or aggressions, in the common, open fashion of contemporary intercourse to-day, but which then, nevertheless, was the rarest and strangest thing in the world.","我们沿途的大部分时间都是坐在草地上、石灰砾或者木梁上，以现代的人们交谈的方式、以君子之态坦率而温和地聊天。这种交谈方式在现在看来可能稀松平常，但在当时却是惊世骇俗的。"
"He for the most part talked, but at some shape of a question I told him—as plainly as I could tell of passions that had for a time become incomprehensible to me—of my murderous pursuit of Nettie and her lover, and how the green vapors overcame me.","虽然大部分时间都是他说我听，但偶尔我也说说我追杀妮蒂和她的情人以及我如何被绿色雾霭淹没的事情——我尽可能以平常的口吻讲述那一度令我无法理解的情愫。"
"He watched me with grave eyes and nodded understandingly, and afterwards he asked me brief penetrating questions about my education, my upbringing, my work.","他灰色的眼睛看着我，表示理解地点点头，然后简短问了几个关于我的教育、成长和工作的问题。"
"There was a deliberation in his manner, brief full pauses, that had in them no element of delay.","他举止沉稳从容，偶尔停顿但毫无迟滞之感。"
"“Yes,” he said, “yes—of course.","“是啊，”他说，“是啊，当然了。"
"What a fool I have been!”","我真笨啊！”"
"and said no more until we had made another of our tripod struggles along the beach.","然后不再说什么，起身沿着沙滩继续往前走。"
"At first I did not see the connection of my story with that self-accusation.","起初我没看出来我的故事和他的自责有任何关联。"
"“Suppose,” he said, panting on the groin, “there had been such a thing as a statesman!...”","“假如，”他边说边喘气，“有一个政客……”"
"He turned to me.","他转身面对着我。"
"“If one had decided all this muddle shall end!","“如果当初有个人坚定地认为所有的混乱都该结束！"
"If one had taken it, as an artist takes his clay, as a man who builds takes site and stone, and made—” He flung out his big broad hand at the glories of sky and sea, and drew a deep breath, “something to fit that setting.”","如果有个人接受了这个意见，就如同艺术家有了了黏土，建筑家有了工地和石头，继而建造——”他举起宽大的手掌指向海天的光辉，深吸了一口气，接着说道，“建造一些东西来陪衬这样的景色。”"
"He added in explanation, “Then there wouldn’t have been such stories as yours at all, you know....”","他又解释道：“那样的话，就绝对不会有你这样的故事了……”"
"“Tell me more about it,” he said, “tell me all about yourself.","“再跟我说说，”他说，“说说你自己的事情。"
"I feel all these things have passed away, all these things are to be changed for ever....","我想这些事情都已经过去了，这些事情都将永久改变……"
"You won’t be what you have been from this time forth.","从今以后你不再是原来那个你了。"
"All the things you have done—don’t matter now.","不论你做过什么，现在都无所谓了。"
"To us, at any rate, they don’t matter at all.","不论如何，那些事情于我们都无所谓了。"
"We have met, who were separated in that darkness behind us.","我们相遇了，我们身后又有谁在黑暗之中分离了呢？"
"Tell me.”","跟我说说你的事吧。”"
"“Yes,” he said; and I told my story straight and as frankly as I have told it to you.","“说吧。”他说道。于是我将我的故事原原本本地告诉了他，就如同我告诉诸位一样。"
"“And there, where those little skerries of weed rock run out to the ebb, beyond the headland, is Bungalow village.","“那儿，到处堆满石块长满杂草的地方，岬角的那边，那儿就是邦格楼村了。"
"What did you do with your pistol?”","你把手枪放哪儿了？”"
"“I left it lying there—among the barley.”","“我把它留在那儿了——麦田里。”"
"He glanced at me from under his light eyelashes.","他透过浅色的睫毛看了我一眼，说道：“"
"“If others feel like you and I,” he said, “there’ll be a lot of pistols left among the barley to-day....”","如果别人都像你我一样，现在麦田里肯定有很多手枪……”"
"So we talked, I and that great, strong man, with the love of brothers so plain between us it needed not a word.","我们就这么聊着，我和这个雄健强壮的男子之间有着兄弟般的情谊，而这情谊如此朴实，根本无需言语。"
"Our souls went out to one another in stark good faith; never before had I had anything but a guarded watchfulness for any fellow-man.","我们的赤诚之心彼此交融，此前我对任何人都是谨小慎微的。"
"Still I see him, upon that wild desolate beach of the ebb tide, I see him leaning against the shelly buttress of a groin, looking down at the poor drowned sailor whose body we presently found.","在那片退潮了的荒无人烟的沙滩上，我看着他倚在一根交叉拱的镶了贝壳的支柱上，低头打量着一具可怜的水手的尸体。这具尸体是我们刚刚发现的。"
"For we found a newly drowned man who had just chanced to miss this great dawn in which we rejoiced.","这个不久前溺死的人恰好错过了我们为之欢欣鼓舞的黎明。"
"We found him lying in a pool of water, among brown weeds in the dark shadow of the timberings.","我们发现他躺在一滩水中，周围是褐色的杂草，被树木枝丫的昏暗阴影笼罩着。"
"You must not overrate the horrors of the former days; in those days it was scarcely more common to see death in England than it would be to-day.","请一定不要以为那个时代有多么可怕，那时候在英国见到死尸并不比现在频繁。"
"This dead man was a sailor from the Rother Adler, the great German battleship that—had we but known it—lay not four miles away along the coast amidst ploughed-up mountains of chalk ooze, a torn and battered mass of machinery, wholly submerged at high water, and holding in its interstices nine hundred drowned brave men, all strong and skilful, all once capable of doing fine things....","这个水手来自德国的大战舰“罗瑟·阿德勒”号——我们之前就知道它了——这个战舰就在离海岸不足四英里的地方。周围是层峦叠嶂。此时的战舰已成了一堆破铜烂铁，完全沉没在深水中了。其间还有溺死的九百多名技术娴熟、强健矫捷的水手……"
"I remember that poor boy very vividly.","那个可怜的男孩的容貌依旧鲜活。"
"He had been drowned during the anaesthesia of the green gas, his fair young face was quiet and calm, but the skin of his chest had been crinkled by scalding water and his right arm was bent queerly back.","他是在绿色气体笼罩下失去知觉后溺水的。年轻俊俏的脸盘安详镇静，只是两颊的皮肤被滚烫的水灼伤皱了起来，右臂则怪异地向后弯曲。"
"Even to this needless death and all its tale of cruelty, beauty and dignity had come.","即使是面对着这样无谓的死亡和残酷，我们也能看到其中的美和高贵。"
"Everything flowed together to significance as we stood there, I, the ill-clad, cheaply equipped proletarian, and Melmount in his great fur-trimmed coat—he was hot with walking but he had not thought to remove it—leaning upon the clumsy groins and pitying this poor victim of the war he had helped to make.","所有事物都汇聚在一起，似乎传递着某种含义。我们站在那儿，我这个衣衫褴褛、装备简陋的无产者，和穿着毛皮大衣的梅尔蒙特——虽然走得浑身发热，他却没有要脱掉大衣的意思。梅尔蒙特靠着那拙劣的交叉拱上，为这位战争的受害者感到惋惜，而自己又何尝不是发动战争的一分子。"
"“Poor lad!”","“可怜的孩子！”"
"he said, “poor lad!","他说道，“可怜的孩子呀！"
"A child we blunderers sent to death!","是我们这些草莽之辈将他送上了绝路！"
"Do look at the quiet beauty of that face, that body—to be flung aside like this!”","看看这平静美丽的脸蛋，看看这身体——竟然被抛在这里！”"
"(I remember that near this dead man’s hand a stranded star-fish writhed its slowly feeling limbs, struggling back toward the sea.","（我记得这个死者的手边一只搁浅的海星扭动着渐渐恢复知觉的触角，挣扎着向海里移动。"
"It left grooved traces in the sand.)","它在沙滩上留下一串凹痕。）"
"“There must be no more of this,” panted Melmount, leaning on my shoulder, “no more of this....”","“不能再让这样的事情发生了，”梅尔蒙特靠着我肩上，喘着气说道，“不能……”"
"But most I recall Melmount as he talked a little later, sitting upon a great chalk boulder with the sunlight on his big, perspiration-dewed face.","关于梅尔蒙特，我记得最多的是他后来坐在一块大石灰砾上说的话。他坐在阳光下，宽大的脸上满是汗珠。"
"He made his resolves.","他下定了决心。"
"“We must end war,” he said, in that full whisper of his; “it is stupidity.","“我们必须停止战争，”他压低声音说道，“战争真是愚蠢之极。"
"With so many people able to read and think—even as it is—there is no need of anything of the sort.","曾经有这么多能思会想的人——现在也还是一样——根本不需要战争这类东西。"
"Gods!","天哪！"
"What have we rulers been at?...","我们这些统治者都做了些什么呀？"
"Drowsing like people in a stifling room, too dull and sleepy and too base toward each other for any one to get up and open the window.","我们就像待在沉闷的屋子里一样，愚钝困乏，彼此之间尔虞我诈，以至于没有一个人起身开开窗。"
"What haven’t we been at?”","我们到底做了什么？”"
"A great powerful figure he sits there still in my memory, perplexed and astonished at himself and all things.","我脑海里他坐在那里的伟岸身躯还清晰若现，面对自己的所作所为和周遭的事情，迷惑震惊不已。"
"“We must change all this,” he repeated, and threw out his broad hands in a powerful gesture against the sea and sky.","“我们必须改变这一切，”他重复道，然后强有力地伸出他宽大的手掌，指向天海之间，"
"“We have done so weakly—Heaven alone knows why!”","“我们太无能了——只有天知道为这样什么会！”"
"I can see him now, queer giant that he looked on that dawnlit beach of splendor, the sea birds flying about us and that crumpled death hard by, no bad symbol in his clumsiness and needless heat of the unawakened powers of the former time.","现在我还能回忆起那个画面。他站在曙光照耀下金碧辉煌的沙滩上，高大得怪异，海鸟在我们周围飞翔，褶皱的尸体渐渐变硬。他的笨拙和先前因巨变而产生的尚未消散的热气中，并没有什么不好的征兆。"
"I remember it as an integral part of that picture that far away across the sandy stretches one of those white estate boards I have described, stuck up a little askew amidst the yellow-green turf upon the crest of the low cliffs.","记忆中的画面还有一个不可或缺的部分，那就是离沙滩较远的地方竖着一块白色的房地产广告（先前描述过那种），有点儿倾斜地立在低矮山崖顶峰的黄绿色草丛间。"
"He talked with a sort of wonder of the former things.","他带着些许迷惑又谈起以前的事情。"
"“Has it ever dawned upon you to imagine the pettiness—the pettiness!—of every soul concerned in a declaration of war?”","“你有没有想过这样的想法——任何一个与发动战争有关的灵魂都是渺小可怜的？”"
"he asked.","他问道。"
"He went on, as though speech was necessary to make it credible, to describe Laycock, who first gave the horror words at the cabinet council, “an undersized Oxford prig with a tenoring voice and a garbage of Greek—the sort of little fool who is brought up on the admiration of his elder sisters....","他接着又说起来，仿佛言语是使那句话可信的必要手段。他向我描述莱科克，是这个人最先在内阁提出那些可恶的建议。他说莱科克是“一个来自牛津的矮小学究，嗓音很高，满嘴废话——就是那种在姐姐们的崇拜下长大的小傻瓜……”"
"“All the time almost,” he said, “I was watching him—thinking what an ass he was to be trusted with men’s lives....","“几乎每时每刻，”他说，“我都在观察他——想着这么一个混蛋怎么值得人们将生命交付于他……"
"I might have done better to have thought that of myself.","如果我对自己也是这么想的话，我可能会做得更好些。"
"I was doing nothing to prevent it all!","我根本就没有去阻止它！"
"The damned little imbecile was up to his neck in the drama of the thing, he liked to trumpet it out, he goggled round at us.","整件事情全都是这个该死的笨蛋一手操纵的。他喜欢大肆宣扬鼓吹战争。他看着我们，"
"‘Then it is war!’","‘那么这就是战争！’"
"he said.","他如是说道。"
"Richover shrugged his shoulders.","里奇福耸了耸肩。"
"I made some slight protest and gave in....","我稍稍表示了一点异议，最后还是让步了……"
"Afterward I dreamt of him.""","后来我又梦到了他。”"
"“What a lot we were!","“我们这么多人！"
"All a little scared at ourselves—all, as it were, instrumental....","一个个都害怕坚持自我——我们都是帮凶……"
"“And it’s fools like that lead to things like this!”","“是莱科克那样的傻瓜导致了这样的事情发生！”"
"He jerked his head at that dead man near by us.","他猛地抬起头望着离我们不远的那具尸体说道。"
"“It will be interesting to know what has happened to the world....","“弄清楚这个世界到底发生了什么会是一件有趣的事情……"
"This green vapor—queer stuff.","绿色气体——奇怪的东西。"
"But I know what has happened to me.","但是我已经知道我自己发生了什么事情。"
"It’s Conversion.","是转变。"
"I’ve always known....","我一直都知道……"
"But this is being a fool.","但我现在仍是傻瓜一个。"
"Talk!","只知道讲空话！"
"I’m going to stop it.”","我要阻止它。”"
"He motioned to rise with his clumsy outstretched hands.","他伸出笨拙的手要站起来。"
"“Stop what?”","“阻止什么？”"
"said I, stepping forward instinctively to help him.","我问道，一边本能地跨步上前帮他。"
"“War,” he said in his great whisper, putting his big hand on my shoulder but making no further attempt to arise, “I’m going to put an end to war—to any sort of war!","“战争，”他低声说道，一边将宽大的手放在我肩膀上，但没有要站起来的意思，又接着说道，“我要阻止战争——任何形式的战争！"
"And all these things that must end.","所有这样的事情都必须终结。"
"The world is beautiful, life is great and splendid, we had only to lift up our eyes and see.","世界时美妙的，生命是伟大壮丽的，我们只需要睁开眼睛看就可以了。"
"Think of the glories through which we have been driving, like a herd of swine in a garden place.","想想我们是如何在这光辉灿烂中飞驰而过，丝毫没有注意到周围的美丽，就像是花园中的猪猡一样。"
"The color in life—the sounds—the shapes!","生活中的色彩——声音——形态！"
"We have had our jealousies, our quarrels, our ticklish rights, our invincible prejudices, our vulgar enterprise and sluggish timidities, we have chattered and pecked one another and fouled the world—like daws in the temple, like unclean birds in the holy place of God.","我们有过嫉妒和争吵，有过多变的权利和顽固的偏见，还有过粗俗的冒险和懒散的羞怯。我们喋喋不休、钩心斗角，将这个世界玷污——就像是圣殿里的穴鸟，上帝的圣地中不洁的飞禽。"
"All my life has been foolishness and pettiness, gross pleasures and mean discretions—all.","我的生活充斥着愚蠢与渺小，粗俗的享乐和近乎卑鄙的谨慎——一直如此。"
"I am a meagre dark thing in this morning’s glow, a penitence, a shame!","我是这曙光中微不足道的污点，是忏悔，是羞耻！"
"And, but for God’s mercy, I might have died this night—like that poor lad there—amidst the squalor of my sins!","上帝仁慈，我今晚可能就会死去——就像那个可怜的年轻人一样——带着肮脏的罪孽死去！"
"No more of this!","再也不会这样了！"
"No more of this!—whether the whole world has changed or no, matters nothing.","再也不会这样了！——不论这是世界改变与否，都已经没关系了。"
"WE TWO HAVE SEEN THIS DAWN!...”","至少我们俩看到了这个黎明！”"
"He paused.","他停了一下。"
"“I will arise and go unto my Father,” he began presently, “and will say unto Him—”","而后他接着说道：“我要走向我主，告诉他——”"
"His voice died away in an inaudible whisper.","他低声说着，声音越来越小，渐渐地听不到了。"
"His hand tightened painfully on my shoulder and he rose....","他忍住痛苦，手紧紧地抓住我的肩膀，然后站了起来……"

"Chapter the Second","第二章"
"The Awakening","觉醒"
"Section 1","第一节"
"So the great Day came to me.","伟大的一天终于到来了。"
"And even as I had awakened so in that same dawn the whole world awoke.","在那个黎明，苏醒的不只是我，还有整个世界。"
"For the whole world of living things had been overtaken by the same tide of insensibility; in an hour, at the touch of this new gas in the comet, the shiver of catalytic change had passed about the globe.","因为整个世界的活物都被某种物质控制而失去了知觉；接触彗星气体后的一个小时之内，催化反应带来的恐惧席卷全球。"
"They say it was the nitrogen of the air, the old AZOTE, that in the twinkling of an eye was changed out of itself, and in an hour or so became a respirable gas, differing indeed from oxygen, but helping and sustaining its action, a bath of strength and healing for nerve and brain.","据说是空气中的氮气(nitrogen)——原来该词写作AZOTE——瞬间发生了变化。在一个小时左右的时间里，它就变成了可供呼吸的气体。但与氧气不同，它帮助并且维持氧气的运作，使人恢复精力，修复神经和大脑的功能。"
"I do not know the precise changes that occurred, nor the names our chemists give them, my work has carried me away from such things, only this I know—I and all men were renewed.","我不清楚确切的变化是什么，也不知道化学家给这些变化命的什么名。我的工作使得我无暇关注这些，我只知道——我和所有其他的人都获得了新生。"
"I picture to myself this thing happening in space, a planetary moment, the faint smudge, the slender whirl of meteor, drawing nearer to this planet,—this planet like a ball, like a shaded rounded ball, floating in the void, with its little, nearly impalpable coat of cloud and air, with its dark pools of ocean, its gleaming ridges of land.","我向自己如此描述太空中发生的场景：一颗运动的行星，微弱的斑点，还有稀薄的旋转体流星群向这个星球步步逼近——这个星球像一个球体，像一个被遮蔽的圆球，在太空中飘荡。它表面是几乎可以忽略的云层和大气层，漆黑的水塘般的海洋，和陆地上熠熠生辉的山脊。"
"And as that midge from the void touches it, the transparent gaseous outer shell clouds in an instant green and then slowly clears again....","当来自太空的“蚊子”轻轻一碰，表面这层透明的气状外壳瞬间就变成了绿色云层，之后又慢慢清澈起来……"
"Thereafter, for three hours or more,—we know the minimum time for the Change was almost exactly three hours because all the clocks and watches kept going—everywhere, no man nor beast nor bird nor any living thing that breathes the air stirred at all but lay still....","后来的三个小时或更久的时间内——我们都知道巨变持续的最短时间基本上刚好是三个小时，因为所有钟表在巨变期间都没有停——任何一个地方的人也好，飞禽走兽也好，只要是呼吸了气体的，都一动不动地躺着……"
"Everywhere on earth that day, in the ears of every one who breathed, there had been the same humming in the air, the same rush of green vapors, the crepitation, the streaming down of shooting stars.","那天，世界各地的人们都听到了巨变其间空气中的嗡嗡声，劈啪声，都看到了涌动的绿色气体和一泻而下的流星雨。"
"The Hindoo had stayed his morning’s work in the fields to stare and marvel and fall, the blue-clothed Chinaman fell head foremost athwart his midday bowl of rice, the Japanese merchant came out from some chaffering in his office amazed and presently lay there before his door, the evening gazers by the Golden Gates were overtaken as they waited for the rising of the great star.","早上在地里忙活着的印度人停下手中的活，盯着天空惊叹着，然后倒下了；穿着蓝色衣服吃着午餐的中国人大都是头横过饭碗倒在餐桌上；办公室里日本商人放下手头的小事走出来观看，惊讶不已，不一会而就倒在了门口；金门的夜班执勤人员等待壮丽的彗星升空时也倒下了。"
"This had happened in every city of the world, in every lonely valley, in every home and house and shelter and every open place.","世界各地都是如此，每个城市，每个偏僻的山谷，每家每户，每个茅草屋，以及任何户外的场所。"
"On the high seas, the crowding steamship passengers, eager for any wonder, gaped and marveled, and were suddenly terror-stricken, and struggled for the gangways and were overcome, the captain staggered on the bridge and fell, the stoker fell headlong among his coals, the engines throbbed upon their way untended, the fishing craft drove by without a hail, with swaying rudder, heeling and dipping....","茫茫大海中一艘拥挤不堪的轮船上，乘客们在热烈地期盼着奇迹发生。他们一个个瞠目结舌地看着，突然之间一阵恐慌，大家都朝舷门挤去，然后都倒下了；船长站在舷梯上摇摇晃晃，最后掉了下去；司炉工一头栽进了煤堆里；引擎突突地响，轮船漫无目的地向前驶去；渔船悄无声息驶过，左右摇摆的舵歪歪斜斜，浮浮沉沉……"
"The great voice of material Fate cried Halt!","命运之声大喊一声“停！”"
"And in the midst of the play the actors staggered, dropped, and were still.","于是正演着戏的演员们摇摇晃晃地倒了下去，一动不动地躺着。"
"The figure runs from my pen.","这样的事不胜枚举。"
"In New York that very thing occurred.","在纽约就真发生了这么一件事情。"
"Most of the theatrical audiences dispersed, but in two crowded houses the company, fearing a panic, went on playing amidst the gloom, and the people, trained by many a previous disaster, stuck to their seats.","大部分的剧院观众都四下逃散了，但有两家剧院因担心引起恐慌，即便气氛压抑也继续表演。先前经历过许多灾难而变得训练有素的人们，则稳如泰山地端坐在椅子上。"
"There they sat, the back rows only moving a little, and there, in disciplined lines, they drooped and failed, nodded, and fell forward or slid down upon the floor.","他们都端坐着，只有后面动静稍大；他们一排排，身子前倾，头往下垂，要么往前倒，要么干脆滑落到地板上了。"
"I am told by Parload—though indeed I know nothing of the reasoning on which his confidence rests—that within an hour of the great moment of impact the first green modification of nitrogen had dissolved and passed away, leaving the air as translucent as ever.","帕罗德告诉我——虽然我对他自信满满的推理一无所知——产生巨大影响的一个小时之内，绿色氮气便溶解消逝了，只留下如初的透亮空气。"
"The rest of that wonderful interlude was clear, had any had eyes to see its clearness.","那个精彩插曲剩下的部分十分明显，任何人都看得到空气的清澈透亮。"
"In London it was night, but in New York, for example, people were in the full bustle of the evening’s enjoyment, in Chicago they were sitting down to dinner, the whole world was abroad.","当时伦敦正是夜晚，而世界其他地方则不然。比如说，纽约的人们正忙着为夜晚的享乐做准备，芝加哥的人们正在吃晚饭。世界大得很。"
"The moonlight must have illuminated streets and squares littered with crumpled figures, through which such electric cars as had no automatic brakes had ploughed on their way until they were stopped by the fallen bodies.","月光照耀下的广场和街道上肯定到处是扭曲的人。往来的车辆因为没有自动刹车，所以横冲直撞，直到撞到了已经倒地的人才停下来。"
"People lay in their dress clothes, in dining-rooms, restaurants, on staircases, in halls, everywhere just as they had been overcome.","人们和衣倒在餐厅、饭馆、楼梯间或者大厅，倒在他们因窒息而昏迷的地方。"
"Men gambling, men drinking, thieves lurking in hidden places, sinful couples, were caught, to arise with awakened mind and conscience amidst the disorder of their sin.","赌博酗酒的男人们、藏匿着的小偷、被捉奸在床的奸夫淫妇，他们从罪恶的混乱之中清醒过来，心灵得到洗礼，良知亦被唤醒。"
"America the comet reached in the full tide of evening life, but Britain lay asleep.","彗星来临时，美国人正在享受夜生活，而英国人则已躺下休息了。"
"But as I have told, Britain did not slumber so deeply but that she was in the full tide of what may have been battle and a great victory.","但他们并没有沉睡，因为他们正在为可能的战斗和巨大的胜利准备着。"
"Up and down the North Sea her warships swept together like a net about their foes.","北海上下游，英国战舰像一张网一样横扫敌军。"
"On land, too, that night was to have decided great issues.","陆地上也是一样，夜晚是解决大问题的好时机。"
"The German camps were under arms from Redingen to Markirch, their infantry columns were lying in swathes like mown hay, in arrested night march on every track between Longnyon and Thiancourt, and between Avricourt and Donen.","德国军营从雷丁根到马科奇都全副武装。他们的步兵队列像被割了的干草一样躺着，夜里便沿着朗英和蒂安科特、阿弗里科特和多恩之间的小路行进。"
"The hills beyond Spincourt were dusted thick with hidden French riflemen; the thin lash of the French skirmishers sprawled out amidst spades and unfinished rifle-pits in coils that wrapped about the heads of the German columns, thence along the Vosges watershed and out across the frontier near Belfort nearly to the Rhine....","在斯宾科特那边的山里，埋伏了大量的法国步兵；一支法兵小分队趴在铁锹和尚未挖好的壕沟中间，那壕沟就在德军列队周围盘旋，将其围剿，之后沿着孚日分水岭，横穿靠近贝尔福的边境，几乎直抵莱茵河。"
"The Hungarian, the Italian peasant, yawned and thought the morning dark, and turned over to fall into a dreamless sleep; the Mahometan world spread its carpet and was taken in prayer.","匈牙利人、意大利农民打着哈欠想着黎明前的黑暗，翻了个身又进入梦乡；伊斯兰教徒铺开地毯做起了祷告。"
"And in Sydney, in Melbourne, in New Zealand, the thing was a fog in the afternoon, that scattered the crowd on race-courses and cricket-fields, and stopped the unloading of shipping and brought men out from their afternoon rest to stagger and litter the streets....","当日下午，在悉尼、墨尔本和新西兰，这事儿还不明朗。人群散布在赛马场和板球场，卸船的工作也停止了。人们午休也免了，纷纷走出来在街道上闲逛……"
"Section 2","第二节"
"My thoughts go into the woods and wildernesses and jungles of the world, to the wild life that shared man’s suspension, and I think of a thousand feral acts interrupted and truncated—as it were frozen, like the frozen words Pantagruel met at sea.","我想到了森林、荒野和丛林，还有和人类一样突然变得一动不动的野生动物。我想起成千的野生动物行动突然中止——像是冰冻了一般，就像是庞大固埃在海边遇到的结冰的字一样。"
"Not only men it was that were quieted, all living creatures that breathe the air became insensible, impassive things.","安静的不只是人，所有呼吸了空气的生物都变得毫无知觉。"
"Motionless brutes and birds lay amidst the drooping trees and herbage in the universal twilight, the tiger sprawled beside his fresh-struck victim, who bled to death in a dreamless sleep.","飞禽走兽一动不动地躺在低垂草木间，沐浴在宇宙的曙光中。一只老虎趴在它刚捕的猎物边，这猎物已经在熟睡中流血死去。"
"The very flies came sailing down the air with wings outspread; the spider hung crumpled in his loaded net; like some gaily painted snowflake the butterfly drifted to earth and grounded, and was still.","苍蝇双翅张开从空中直落下来；蜘蛛蜷缩着挂在它满载猎物的网上；蝴蝶像彩色的雪花飘落到地上，静静地躺在那里。"
"And as a queer contrast one gathers that the fishes in the sea suffered not at all....","与此形成怪异对比的是，海里的鱼却未受丝毫影响……"
"Speaking of the fishes reminds me of a queer little inset upon that great world-dreaming.","提起这些鱼，我倒想起全宇宙大沉睡之中一种奇怪的小昆虫。"
"The odd fate of the crew of the submarine vessel B 94 has always seemed memorable to me.","B94号潜艇上船员们的奇怪命运，我一直难以忘怀。"
"So far as I know, they were the only men alive who never saw that veil of green drawn across the world.","据我所知，他们是唯一没有看到绿色雾霭席卷全球且生还的人。"
"All the while that the stillness held above, they were working into the mouth of the Elbe, past the booms and the mines, very slowly and carefully, a sinister crustacean of steel, explosive crammed, along the muddy bottom.","当整个世界一片沉寂的时候，他们正跻身于拥挤不堪的潜水艇——像是极其危险的钢铁乌龟——沿着淤泥遍布的海底，小心翼翼地避过炸弹和水雷，缓缓向易北河入口行进。"
"They trailed a long clue that was to guide their fellows from the mother ship floating awash outside.","他们留下一条长长的绳索以便引导同伴藏在水面之下从母舰内漂出来。"
"Then in the long channel beyond the forts they came up at last to mark down their victims and get air.","最后他们沿着堡垒那边长长的水渠上了岸，清点了牺牲的人数。"
"That must have been before the twilight of dawn, for they tell of the brightness of the stars.","那个时候肯定是破晓之前，因为他们谈到了星星的光辉。"
"They were amazed to find themselves not three hundred yards from an ironclad that had run ashore in the mud, and heeled over with the falling tide.","他们惊奇地发现，一艘装甲舰搁浅在不足三百码的岸边泥淖中，随着落潮晃动不止。"
"It was a fire amid ships, but no one heeded that—no one in all that strange clear silence heeded that—and not only this wrecked vessel, but all the dark ships lying about them, it seemed to their perplexed and startled minds must be full of dead men!","有些船只起火了，但是他们之中没一个人注意到——在一片奇怪的彻底寂静中没有一个人注意到——除了这只破烂的船，其他黑乎乎的船只都浮在他们周围。他们迷惑不解、惊慌失措，肯定以为船内都是死人！"
"Theirs I think must have been one of the strangest of all experiences; they were never insensible; at once, and, I am told, with a sudden catch of laughter, they began to breathe the new air.","我想他们的经历是最奇特的了，他们未曾失去知觉，有人告诉我他们马上就在一阵大笑之余开始呼吸新的空气了。"
"None of them has proved a writer; we have no picture of their wonder, no description of what was said.","可惜他们中没有一位是作家，因此没人写下他们的奇遇，也没人记录下他们所说的东西。"
"But we know these men were active and awake for an hour and a half at least before the general awakening came, and when at last the Germans stirred and sat up they found these strangers in possession of their battleship, the submarine carelessly adrift, and the Englishmen, begrimed and weary, but with a sort of furious exultation, still busy, in the bright dawn, rescuing insensible enemies from the sinking conflagration....","但我们知道这些人至少比其他人清醒早一个半小时。最后德军惊醒坐了起来后却发现这些陌生人已经占领了他们的战舰，潜水艇则随波漂浮。这些陌生英军，一身污垢与疲惫，兴高采烈地忙着从火势渐弱的大火中营救失去知觉的敌军。"
"But the thought of certain stokers the sailors of the submarine failed altogether to save brings me back to the thread of grotesque horror that runs through all this event, the thread I cannot overlook for all the splendors of human well-being that have come from it.","但一想起潜水艇的水手们没能救出部分司炉工，贯穿这一整件事的荒诞与恐怖又重现在我脑海。即使看到逃过这一劫的人们健康幸福地生活着的场景，我也无法忽视这荒诞与恐怖。"
"I cannot forget the unguided ships that drove ashore, that went down in disaster with all their sleeping hands, nor how, inland, motor-cars rushed to destruction upon the roads, and trains upon the railways kept on in spite of signals, to be found at last by their amazed, reviving drivers standing on unfamiliar lines, their fires exhausted, or, less lucky, to be discovered by astonished peasants or awakening porters smashed and crumpled up into heaps of smoking, crackling ruin.","我无法忘记触岸损毁的船只，船上沉睡的水手也难逃劫难；也无法忘记陆上行驶的汽车是如何横冲直撞直至报废；还无法忘记铁轨上的火车无视信号灯一直往前开，最后，要么是苏醒了的火车司机惊讶地发现火车已经熄火，停在了陌生的轨道上，要么是——运气差点儿的话——震惊的农民或清醒了的乘务员发现火车已经撞毁，成了一堆冒烟的、“哐当”作响的废铁了。"
"The foundry fires of the Four Towns still blazed, the smoke of our burning still denied the sky.","四镇的铸造厂依旧烧着熊熊烈火，滚滚浓烟把天空遮得严严实实。"
"Fires burnt indeed the brighter for the Change—and spread....","对这次巨变而言，这火光实在是明亮，并且向四周蔓延……"
"Section 3","第三节"
"Picture to yourself what happened between the printing and composing of the copy of the New Paper that lies before me now.","想象一下《新报》印刷与排版期间发生的事情。现在我眼前都摆了一份这样的报纸。"
"It was the first newspaper that was printed upon earth after the Great Change.","这是当时巨变发生后世上发行的第一份报纸。"
"It was pocket-worn and browned, made of a paper no man ever intended for preservation.","我保存的这份报纸当时就已残破不堪了，纸张呈褐色，是在那种没人会长期保存的纸上印制而成的。"
"I found it on the arbor table in the inn garden while I was waiting for Nettie and Verrall, before that last conversation of which I have presently to tell.","我是在旅馆花园的木桌上发现它的，当时我正在等候妮蒂和维罗尔，打算和他们再谈最后一次。待会儿我会描述这次谈话的。"
"As I look at it all that scene comes back to me, and Nettie stands in her white raiment against a blue-green background of sunlit garden, scrutinizing my face as I read....","此时看着眼前的报纸，往事又浮现在眼前。她当时身着素衣，站在阳光明媚、碧绿青葱的花园中，凝视着正在看报的我……"
"It is so frayed that the sheet cracks along the folds and comes to pieces in my hands.","这份报纸已经磨损得太厉害，折痕处已经裂开，在我手里碎成一片一片的了。"
"It lies upon my desk, a dead souvenir of the dead ages of the world, of the ancient passions of my heart.","它躺在我的桌上，作为逝去的时代和我昔日情怀的纪念品。"
"I know we discussed its news, but for the life of me I cannot recall what we said, only I remember that Nettie said very little, and that Verrall for a time read it over my shoulder.","我记得当时我们讨论了报上的新闻，但是我一辈子都没想起来我们具体说了些什么。我只记得妮蒂的话很少，而维罗尔则从我身后探过头来读报。"
"And I did not like him to read over my shoulder....","我不喜欢他探过头来读我的报纸……"
"The document before me must have helped us through the first awkwardness of that meeting.","眼前的这份报纸当时肯定帮我们化解了相逢时的尴尬。"
"But of all that we said and did then I must tell in a later chapter....","至于我们说了什么做了什么，我会在稍后的章节中讲述。"
"It is easy to see the New Paper had been set up overnight, and then large pieces of the stereo plates replaced subsequently.","显而易见，《新报》是连夜就排好了版，随后几大块立体印刷版就归位准备印刷了。"
"I do not know enough of the old methods of printing to know precisely what happened.","我对旧式印刷方式不太了解，因此也不知道具体发生了什么。"
"The thing gives one an impression of large pieces of type having been cut away and replaced by fresh blocks.","整件事情给人的印象是，大片的打字印刷被去掉了，取而代之的是新的刻板印刷。"
"There is something very rough and ready about it all, and the new portions print darker and more smudgily than the old, except toward the left, where they have missed ink and indented.","刻板印刷的部分都有些粗糙，较旧的印刷方式而言，印出来的字更黑且多污迹，只有左边例外，因为那里没有油墨又呈锯齿状。"
"A friend of mine, who knows something of the old typography, has suggested to me that the machinery actually in use for the New Paper was damaged that night, and that on the morning of the Change Banghurst borrowed a neighboring office—perhaps in financial dependence upon him—to print in.","我的一个朋友对旧印刷术有所了解，他提示我说《新报》使用的机器其实当晚就被毁掉了，巨变后的早上，班赫斯特借用了隔壁办公室继续印刷——大概那家公司在资金方面要依赖于他。"
"The outer pages belong entirely to the old period, the only parts of the paper that had undergone alteration are the two middle leaves.","报纸外层的几页全都是旧式的排版，唯一有些变化的是中间的两页。"
"Here we found set forth in a curious little four-column oblong of print, WHAT HAS HAPPENED.","中间一个四栏的小长方形版面很令人好奇，上面写着“发生了什么”。"
"This cut across a column with scare headings beginning, “Great Naval Battle Now in Progress.","这一行字横插进其中的一栏，接着是骇人的引语，“大规模海战正在进行。"
"The Fate of Two Empires in the Balance.","两国命运尚无定论。"
"Reported Loss of Two More—”","双方损失进一步加大——”"
"These things, one gathered, were beneath notice now.","这些由某人搜集的信息已无人问津了。"
"Probably it was guesswork, and fabricated news in the first instance.","或许这些报道都是猜测拼凑出来的。"
"It is curious to piece together the worn and frayed fragments, and reread this discolored first intelligence of the new epoch.","我将这磨损残破的碎片拼接起来，重读这份已经褪色的新纪元的第一张报纸，又好奇起来。"
"The simple clear statements in the replaced portion of the paper impressed me at the time, I remember, as bald and strange, in that framework of shouting bad English.","我还记得，这个简单明了的报导印在报纸改版部分，内容简单而奇怪，用词拙劣，语气张扬。"
"Now they seem like the voice of a sane man amidst a vast faded violence.","现在看来这些报导像是身处日渐平息的暴力活动中一个明智之人的呼声。"
"But they witness to the prompt recovery of London from the gas; the new, swift energy of rebound in that huge population.","这些报导证明了伦敦遭受绿气袭击后的迅速复苏和伦敦人民迅速全新的振作。"
"I am surprised now, as I reread, to note how much research, experiment, and induction must have been accomplished in the day that elapsed before the paper was printed....","此刻我重读这份报纸，惊讶地发现，在这份报纸出版前的一天，竟然有如此之多的研究、实验和总结已经完成……"
"But that is by the way.","不过这只是稍纵即逝的想法而已。"
"As I sit and muse over this partly carbonized sheet, that same curious remote vision comes again to me that quickened in my mind that morning, a vision of those newspaper offices I have already described to you going through the crisis.","我面对着这份已部分碳化的报纸坐着，冥思苦想，脑海里另一个令人好奇的悠远场景再次浮现在眼前，这一场景此前在我脑海闪现过。我在想我描述过的那些报社是如何度过那场危机的。"
"The catalytic wave must have caught the place in full swing, in its nocturnal high fever, indeed in a quite exceptional state of fever, what with the comet and the war, and more particularly with the war.","催化浪潮肯定十分迅速就席卷了这个地方，还伴随着夜间高温——十分少见的高温——这是由彗星和战争导致的，特别是战争。"
"Very probably the Change crept into the office imperceptibly, amidst the noise and shouting, and the glare of electric light that made the night atmosphere in that place; even the green flashes may have passed unobserved there, the preliminary descending trails of green vapor seemed no more than unseasonable drifting wisps of London fog.","变化很可能是悄无声息地潜入办公室的。当时周围喧嚣不已，电灯的灯光也使办公室里面恍如白昼。绿光可能都没人注意到，最先飘下来的丝丝绿色气体看起来就像是伦敦常年漂浮的雾气。"
"(In those days London even in summer was not safe against dark fogs.) And then at the last the Change poured in and overtook them.","（那个时代浓雾使得伦敦在夏季都不安全。）最后，绿气涌入，席卷整个地方，变化也随即发生了。"
"If there was any warning at all for them, it must have been a sudden universal tumult in the street, and then a much more universal quiet.","如果早有关于巨变的警告的话，一定会发生全球性恐慌，然后是更大范围的静谧。"
"They could have had no other intimation.","可惜他们没有得到任何通知。"
"There was no time to stop the presses before the main development of green vapor had overwhelmed every one.","当绿色气体席卷而来，笼罩了所有人时，已经没时间将印刷机停下来了。"
"It must have folded about them, tumbled them to the earth, masked and stilled them.","人们周围的气体一定越来越浓，导致看不清而跌倒在地面，气体逐渐逼近，直至他们失去知觉。"
"My imagination is always curiously stirred by the thought of that, because I suppose it is the first picture I succeeded in making for myself of what had happened in the towns.","想到这些的时候，我的想象力总是会奇怪地活跃起来。因为我觉得这是我独自一人成功描绘出城镇发生的一切。"
"It has never quite lost its strangeness for me that when the Change came, machinery went on working.","当巨变来临，而机器并未停止运转。我当时觉得那是非常奇怪的。"
"I don’t precisely know why that should have seemed so strange to me, but it did, and still to a certain extent does.","我也不太清楚为什么会觉得奇怪，但事实就是如此。时至今日，我还是觉得有点儿奇怪。"
"One is so accustomed, I suppose, to regard machinery as an extension of human personality that the extent of its autonomy the Change displayed came as a shock to me.","我想，人们都习惯性地将机械视作人的延伸。巨变所展现出来的机械的自主性震撼了我。"
"The electric lights, for example, hazy green-haloed nebulas, must have gone on burning at least for a time; amidst the thickening darkness the huge presses must have roared on, printing, folding, throwing aside copy after copy of that fabricated battle report with its quarter column of scare headlines, and all the place must have still quivered and throbbed with the familiar roar of the engines.","比如说带着模糊地绿色光晕的电灯，那一定亮了一段时间；还有一片漆黑中巨大的打印机，不停地轰鸣、打印、折叠，再一份份推到旁边。报纸上是捏造的战况报道，和四分栏内耸人听闻的标题。即便绿气袭来，机器照旧轰轰地响，震得四处都微微颤动。"
"And this though no men ruled there at all any more!","但此时的机器已经完全没人操控了。"
"Here and there beneath that thickening fog the crumpled or outstretched forms of men lay still.","愈来愈浓的绿雾下到处是一动不动地蜷着或四仰八叉地躺着的人。"
"A wonderful thing that must have seemed, had any man had by chance the power of resistance to the vapor, and could he have walked amidst it.","如果某个人恰好有抵御这种气体的力量，而且还能够在其间穿梭的话，那一定是件非常令人惊奇的事情。"
"And soon the machines must have exhausted their feed of ink and paper, and thumped and banged and rattled emptily amidst the general quiet.","很快机器就耗尽了油墨和纸张，只是一个劲儿地在一片静谧中空洞地敲打撞击。"
"Then I suppose the furnaces failed for want of stoking, the steam pressure fell in the pistons, the machinery slackened, the lights burnt dim, and came and went with the ebb of energy from the power-station.","我猜想后来炉火因为没人添煤就渐渐熄灭了，活塞内的蒸汽压力也渐渐变低，于是机器就懒洋洋地磨起洋工来了。灯光也慢慢黯淡下来，因为发电站供电不足而闪烁不定。"
"Who can tell precisely the sequence of these things now?","谁知道接下来发生什么了呢？"
"And then, you know, amidst the weakening and terminating noises of men, the green vapor cleared and vanished, in an hour indeed it had gone, and it may be a breeze stirred and blew and went about the earth.","之后，人声渐弱渐无，绿色气体也慢慢消散，变得越来越淡，大约一个小时候就完全没了踪迹，可能化作了一阵微风四处飘摇呢。"
"The noises of life were all dying away, but some there were that abated nothing, that sounded triumphantly amidst the universal ebb.","各种生命之声荡然无存，但是有些事物的声音却未减丝毫，在全世界的低潮中依旧响得欢欣鼓舞。"
"To a heedless world the church towers tolled out two and then three.","教堂塔楼的钟声响了两下，而后又响了一下，但是世上已经没人注意它了。"
"Clocks ticked and chimed everywhere about the earth to deafened ears....","世界各地的钟“滴答”响着，到了整点便报时，但也没人能听到了……"
"And then came the first flush of morning, the first rustlings of the revival.","而后清晨的第一缕阳光出现了，接着是第一波苏醒引起的沙沙声。"
"Perhaps in that office the filaments of the lamps were still glowing, the machinery was still pulsing weakly, when the crumpled, booted heaps of cloth became men again and began to stir and stare.","可能那件办公室里的电灯灯丝还亮着，机器也还在无力地震动。当蜷着倒在一堆的人们醒来以后看到这一切时，不禁惊得目瞪口呆。"
"The chapel of the printers was, no doubt, shocked to find itself asleep.","印刷工人们发现自己竟然睡着了，无疑很震惊。"
"Amidst that dazzling dawn the New Paper woke to wonder, stood up and blinked at its amazing self....","在那个炫目的黎明，清醒过来的《新报》也疑惑不已。它站了起来，惊奇地看着自己……"
"The clocks of the city churches, one pursuing another, struck four.","城里各个教堂的钟声争先恐后地响了四声。"
"The staffs, crumpled and disheveled, but with a strange refreshment in their veins, stood about the damaged machinery, marveling and questioning; the editor read his overnight headlines with incredulous laughter.","员工们尽管衣衫不整、蓬头垢面，但是精神却异常爽朗。他们站在损毁的机器周围一边惊叹一边询问发生了什么事情；编辑边笑边读着自己连夜赶出的标题，觉得实在匪夷所思。"
"There was much involuntary laughter that morning.","那个早晨，很多人都不由自主地笑了。"
"Outside, the mail men patted the necks and rubbed the knees of their awakening horses....","门外的邮递员给刚醒来的马儿拍了拍脖子，擦了擦膝盖……"
"Then, you know, slowly and with much conversation and doubt, they set about to produce the paper.","接着，经过大量的讨论和质疑，他们便又着手印刷报纸。"
"Imagine those bemused, perplexed people, carried on by the inertia of their old occupations and doing their best with an enterprise that had suddenly become altogether extraordinary and irrational.","想想那些一头雾水人们，受职业习惯的影响继续工作着，并尽力接受这个已经截然不同而毫不合理的公司。"
"They worked amidst questionings, and yet light-heartedly.","尽管他们满腹狐疑地工作着，但是也颇为轻松愉快，"
"At every stage there must have been interruptions for discussion.","时不时地会停下来讨论一番。"
"The paper only got down to Menton five days late.","报纸送达芒通时只比平时晚了五天。"
"Section 4","第四节"
"Then let me give you a vivid little impression I received of a certain prosaic person, a grocer, named Wiggins, and how he passed through the Change.","我再跟你说说威金斯——一个杂货店老板，有点儿无聊——是如何度过此次巨变的，以及他留给我的生动印象。"
"I heard this man’s story in the post-office at Menton, when, in the afternoon of the First Day, I bethought me to telegraph to my mother.","巨变后第一天的下午，我想应该给母亲去一份电报，于是来到了芒通的邮局。在那里我听到了威金斯的故事。"
"The place was also a grocer’s shop, and I found him and the proprietor talking as I went in.","这个邮局同时也是一家杂货铺。我进去的时候威金斯正和店主聊天。"
"They were trade competitors, and Wiggins had just come across the street to break the hostile silence of a score of years.","他们是生意场上的老对头。威金斯刚从对街走过来，就是为了化解他们十几年来的积怨。"
"The sparkle of the Change was in their eyes, their slightly flushed cheeks, their more elastic gestures, spoke of new physical influences that had invaded their beings.","巨变令他们双眼炯炯有神，脸颊微微泛着红光，身体也更矫捷了。他们正谈着身心上受到的新影响。"
"“It did us no good, all our hatred,” Mr. Wiggins said to me, explaining the emotion of their encounter; “it did our customers no good.","“一切仇恨都对我们无益，”威金斯先生对我说道，向我解释了他们之间的冲突，“仇恨对我们的顾客也无益。"
"I’ve come to tell him that.","我来就是为了告诉他这些。"
"You bear that in mind, young man, if ever you come to have a shop of your own.","年轻人，如果哪天你也开了一家自己的店，你要记住我说的这番话。"
"It was a sort of stupid bitterness possessed us, and I can’t make out we didn’t see it before in that light.","我们是被一种愚蠢的痛苦给攫住了。我不明白在绿光出现的那个晚上以前，我们怎么都没发现这一点。"
"Not so much downright wickedness it wasn’t as stupidity.","所有的丑恶行径都同样愚蠢。"
"A stupid jealousy!","一种愚蠢的嫉妒心理！"
"Think of it!—two human beings within a stone’s throw, who have not spoken for twenty years, hardening our hearts against each other!”","想想看！近在咫尺的两个人，二十年来竟然没说过一句话，彼此越来越冷酷无情！”"
"“I can’t think how we came to such a state, Mr. Wiggins,” said the other, packing tea into pound packets out of mere habit as he spoke.","“我不知道我们怎么到了如此田地，威金斯先生，”对方边说边习惯性地将茶叶装入磅装的袋中，"
"“It was wicked pride and obstinacy.","“是因为可恶的傲慢和固执。"
"We KNEW it was foolish all the time.”","我们其实一直都知道这样做是很愚蠢的。”"
"I stood affixing the adhesive stamp to my telegram.","我站在那儿，将带胶邮票贴在电报上。"
"“Only the other morning,” he went on to me, “I was cutting French eggs.","“就前几天早上，”他向我继续道，“我降低了法国鸡蛋的价格。"
"Selling at a loss to do it.","打算亏本出售。"
"He’d marked down with a great staring ticket to ninepence a dozen—I saw it as I went past.","他之前就减价了，在醒目的巨型标价牌上写着‘九便士一打’——我路过的时候看到的。"
"Here’s my answer!”","那是我的对策！”"
"He indicated a ticket.","他指了指一张标价牌说道。"
"“‘Eightpence a dozen—same as sold elsewhere for ninepence.’","“‘八便士一打——和别处九便士的蛋一模一样。’"
"A whole penny down, bang off!","整整便宜了一便士，天哪！"
"Just a touch above cost—if that—and even then—” He leant over the counter to say impressively, “NOT THE SAME EGGS!”","只比成本高一点点——如果是那种蛋的话——可是——”他趴在柜台上得意洋洋地对我说道，“我卖的不是那种蛋！”"
"“Now, what people in their senses would do things like that?”","“看看，哪个有头脑的人会做那种事啊？”"
"said Mr. Wiggins.","威金斯说道。"
"I sent my telegram—the proprietor dispatched it for me, and while he did so I fell exchanging experiences with Mr. Wiggins.","我发了电报——其实是店主帮我发出去的。我趁着那个档儿和威金斯先生谈论起经历来。"
"He knew no more than I did about the nature of the change that had come over things.","关于万物之所以发生变化的本质，他知道的并不比我多。"
"He had been alarmed by the green flashes, he said, so much so that after watching for a time from behind his bedroom window blind, he had got up and hastily dressed and made his family get up also, so that they might be ready for the end.","他说他起初被绿色的闪光吓醒了，于是躲在卧室百叶窗后面观察了一阵子便起床匆匆穿好衣服，然后把家人都叫起来，以便为末日做准备。"
"He made them put on their Sunday clothes.","他让家人把周日礼拜的衣服穿上。"
"They all went out into the garden together, their minds divided between admiration at the gloriousness of the spectacle and a great and growing awe.","然后一起走到花园，一边感叹天空的壮丽奇景，一边怀揣着无比的敬畏。"
"They were Dissenters, and very religious people out of business hours, and it seemed to them in those last magnificent moments that, after all, science must be wrong and the fanatics right.","他们是不信奉国教的人，但是上班时间外他们又十分笃信宗教。在最后那恢弘壮丽的时候，他们觉得科学到底还是错的，宗教狂热分子才是正确的。"
"With the green vapors came conviction, and they prepared to meet their God....","绿色气体坚定了他们的看法，他们准备着去见上帝……"
"This man, you must understand, was a common-looking man, in his shirt-sleeves and with an apron about his paunch, and he told his story in an Anglian accent that sounded mean and clipped to my Staffordshire ears; he told his story without a thought of pride, and as it were incidentally, and yet he gave me a vision of something heroic.","你得理解，此人相貌平平，穿着长袖衬衫，大肚皮上围着围裙。他操着盎格鲁口音讲着他的故事，以我这斯塔福德郡的耳朵听来，语言直白清晰。他的讲述中并未有自豪之感，却偶然地呈现了一些英勇的画面。"
"These people did not run hither and thither as many people did.","这些人并未像其他人一样四处奔逃。"
"These four simple, common people stood beyond their back door in their garden pathway between the gooseberry bushes, with the terrors of their God and His Judgments closing in upon them, swiftly and wonderfully—and there they began to sing.","这平凡纯朴的四个人站在后门外的花园小道上，两边是醋栗丛。怀着对迅速而奇妙地向他们逼近的上帝以及上帝的审判的恐惧，他们唱起歌来。"
"There they stood, father and mother and two daughters, chanting out stoutly, but no doubt a little flatly after the manner of their kind—","他们站在那儿，父亲、母亲还有两个女儿，坚定地颂唱着，但无疑他们的腔调有些枯燥——"
"“In Zion’s Hope abiding, My soul in Triumph sings—”","“在对天国的永久期望中，我的灵魂唱着胜利的歌曲——”"
"until one by one they fell, and lay still.","然后他们一个个相继倒了下去，静静地躺着。"
"The postmaster had heard them in the gathering darkness, “In Zion’s Hope abiding.”...","邮政局长曾听到他们在越来越浓的黑暗中唱着“在对天国的永久期望中……”"
"It was the most extraordinary thing in the world to hear this flushed and happy-eyed man telling that story of his recent death.","听这位满面红光、两眼流露着欢喜的人讲述他新近的死亡经历，是世上最不寻常的事情了。"
"It did not seem at all possible to have happened in the last twelve hours.","事情就发生在过去的十二个小时内，这看来似乎是完全不可能的。"
"It was minute and remote, these people who went singing through the darkling to their God.","这些人在黑暗中向他们的上帝唱着歌，他们的影像显得精细却又遥远。"
"It was like a scene shown to me, very small and very distinctly painted, in a locket.","对我而言，他们就像是画在一个小盒子里的图画，小巧精细。"
"But that effect was not confined to this particular thing.","但巨变的影响并不只局限于这件特定的事情。"
"A vast number of things that had happened before the coming of the comet had undergone the same transfiguring reduction.","彗星来临前发生的许多事情都历经了同样的圣洁的微缩。"
"Other people, too, I have learnt since, had the same illusion, a sense of enlargement.","后来我还了解到其他人也有同样的幻觉，一种放大的感觉。"
"It seems to me even now that the little dark creature who had stormed across England in pursuit of Nettie and her lover must have been about an inch high, that all that previous life of ours had been an ill-lit marionette show, acted in the twilight....","即使现在再来回忆，那个黑色的小小的人——疯狂地在英格兰穿行，搜寻妮蒂和她的情人——一定只有一英寸左右高。我们曾经的生活，就像是一场光线昏暗的木偶表演，在晨曦中上演着……"
"Section 5","第五节"
"The figure of my mother comes always into my conception of the Change.","一想到巨变，母亲的身影就会出现在我的脑海。"
"I remember how one day she confessed herself.","我记得有一天她是如何忏悔的。"
"She had been very sleepless that night, she said, and took the reports of the falling stars for shooting; there had been rioting in Clayton and all through Swathinglea all day, and so she got out of bed to look.","她说，那晚她总是睡不着，于是就拿起有关流星的报告，那时在克莱顿和整个斯沃星利地区已经出现了骚乱，骚乱持续了一整天，于是母亲便下床观望。"
"She had a dim sense that I was in all such troubles.","她隐约感觉到我陷入了这样的困境。"
"But she was not looking when the Change came.","但当巨变来临时，她并没有观望。"
"“When I saw the stars a-raining down, dear,” she said, “and thought of you out in it, I thought there’d be no harm in saying a prayer for you, dear?","“当我看到星星像雨一般落下时，亲爱的，”她说，“想到你深陷其中，我想为你祷告应该不会有什么危害的，是吧，我亲爱的孩子？"
"I thought you wouldn’t mind that.”","我想你不会介意的。”"
"And so I got another of my pictures—the green vapors come and go, and there by her patched coverlet that dear old woman kneels and droops, still clasping her poor gnarled hands in the attitude of prayer—prayer to IT—for me!","于是我脑海中呈现出我的另一个影像——绿色气体来过又离去，那位可亲的老妇人在打了补丁的床罩旁边弓着身子跪着，依然保持着祈祷者的姿势，粗糙的双手紧握着——向上帝祈祷着——为了我！"
"Through the meagre curtains and blinds of the flawed refracting window I see the stars above the chimneys fade, the pale light of dawn creeps into the sky, and her candle flares and dies....","透过稀疏的窗帘和反射着光的有裂缝的百叶窗，我看见烟囱上端的星星渐渐褪去，黎明微弱的光悄悄爬上天空，她的烛火摇曳着而后熄灭……"
"That also went with me through the stillness—that silent kneeling figure, that frozen prayer to God to shield me, silent in a silent world, rushing through the emptiness of space....","寂静中，这幅画面一直伴随着我——一动不动地跪倒着的身躯，祈求上帝保佑我。这祷告，穿过空旷的天空，在寂静的世界里毫无声息……"
"Section 6","第六节"
"With the dawn that awakening went about the earth.","黎明之际，所有人都渐渐苏醒了。"
"I have told how it came to me, and how I walked in wonder through the transfigured cornfields of Shaphambury.","我已经描述了我是如何醒来以及如何惊讶地穿过香普汉贝里圣洁的玉米地。"
"It came to every one.","所有人都在苏醒。"
"Near me, and for the time, clear forgotten by me, Verrall and Nettie woke—woke near one another, each heard before all other sounds the other’s voice amidst the stillness, and the light.","那是在我附近的维罗尔和妮蒂也醒来了——我已经全然忘记他们了——两人相距不远，在一片静谧和光芒中醒来后，最初听到的就是彼此的声音。"
"And the scattered people who had run to and fro, and fallen on the beach of Bungalow village, awoke; the sleeping villagers of Menton started, and sat up in that unwonted freshness and newness; the contorted figures in the garden, with the hymn still upon their lips, stirred amidst the flowers, and touched each other timidly, and thought of Paradise.","那些先前四下逃散的人们，倒在邦格楼村的沙滩上，散布在各处，也苏醒过来了；沉睡的芒通村民惊醒了，在不寻常的清新和新奇中坐起身来；花园中蜷着身躯的人们嘴里仍然唱着圣歌，他们从花丛中惊起，胆怯地摸了摸彼此，想着这里是不是天堂。"
"My mother found herself crouched against the bed, and rose—rose with a glad invincible conviction of accepted prayer....","我的母亲发现自己靠着床蜷着，便站了起来——她异常兴奋，坚信自己的祈祷得到了回应……"
"Already, when it came to us, the soldiers, crowded between the lines of dusty poplars along the road to Allarmont, were chatting and sharing coffee with the French riflemen, who had hailed them from their carefully hidden pits among the vineyards up the slopes of Beauville.","当我们醒来时，士兵们已经拥挤在通往阿拉蒙特的道路上。路的两旁是一排排灰尘扑扑的杨树。这些士兵们正在和法国步枪手们聊着天、喝着咖啡。这些法国枪手们此前还从博维勒山坡上的葡萄园间隐秘的战壕里向他们呼叫。"
"A certain perplexity had come to these marksmen, who had dropped asleep tensely ready for the rocket that should wake the whirr and rattle of their magazines.","某种困惑攫住了这些枪手。他们在紧张地准备发射火箭时却睡了过去。这支火箭原本将使整个舆论界哗然的。"
"At the sight and sound of the stir and human confusion in the roadway below, it had come to each man individually that he could not shoot.","然而，当看到下面的士兵们困惑的情形、听到喧嚣声时，他们每个人都觉得不能开枪。"
"One conscript, at least, has told his story of his awakening, and how curious he thought the rifle there beside him in his pit, how he took it on his knees to examine.","至少有一名义务兵讲了他苏醒的情形。他说醒来后发现战壕里他身旁的来复枪，他十分诧异，还说了他是如何将枪放在膝盖上端详。"
"Then, as his memory of its purpose grew clearer, he dropped the thing, and stood up with a kind of joyful horror at the crime escaped, to look more closely at the men he was to have assassinated.","然后，他渐渐想起来此前是打算用这枪做什么。他一把将枪扔在地上，站起身来凑近了那些本来已被杀害的人，庆幸惨剧并未发生。"
"“Braves types,” he thought, they looked for such a fate.","“勇敢的士兵们，”他想，他们寻找的竟是如此的命运。"
"The summoning rocket never flew.","蓄势待发的火箭再没发射。"
"Below, the men did not fall into ranks again, but sat by the roadside, or stood in groups talking, discussing with a novel incredulity the ostensible causes of the war.","山下的士兵们也没再排成队列，而是坐在路边或者三五成群地站着聊天，用一种新奇的质疑的口吻讨论着战争诡称的理由。"
"“The Emperor!”","“什么狗屁君主！”"
"said they; and “Oh, nonsense!","他们说道，接着又说，“呸！胡闹！"
"We’re civilized men.","我们都是文明人。"
"Get some one else for this job!...","找别人去做这事儿……"
"Where’s the coffee?”","哪儿有咖啡啊？”"
"The officers held their own horses, and talked to the men frankly, regardless of discipline.","长官们牵着自己的马，无视纪律地和士兵们坦率地谈着。"
"Some Frenchmen out of the rifle-pits came sauntering down the hill.","一些法国兵从战壕里走了来，跑下山溜达。"
"Others stood doubtfully, rifles still in hand.","其他一些人踌躇地站着，手里依然拿着枪。"
"Curious faces scanned these latter.","一些面带疑惑的人扫视了一下这些握着枪的法国人。"
"Little arguments sprang as: “Shoot at us!","小争执由此而生：“朝我们开枪啊！"
"Nonsense!","胡说八道！"
"They’re respectable French citizens.”","他们可是受人尊敬的法国公民。”"
"There is a picture of it all, very bright and detailed in the morning light, in the battle gallery amidst the ruins at old Nancy, and one sees the old-world uniform of the “soldier,” the odd caps and belts and boots, the ammunition-belt, the water-bottle, the sort of tourist’s pack the men carried, a queer elaborate equipment.","在老南希城废墟上的战争陈列馆内，有一幅画描述了整个场景，在晨光中显得明亮细腻。人们看得到那些“士兵”们在旧世界穿的制服，怪异的帽子、腰带和靴子，弹夹，水壶，还有像旅行者用的军用背包——这是一个奇特而精细的装备。"
"The soldiers had awakened one by one, first one and then another.","战士们一个接一个陆续醒来。"
"I wonder sometimes whether, perhaps, if the two armies had come awake in an instant, the battle, by mere habit and inertia, might not have begun.","有时候我在想，或许，如果两个部队的士兵们都在同一瞬间醒来，战争是不是会，纯粹因为习惯和惯性而发生呢。"
"But the men who waked first, sat up, looked about them in astonishment, had time to think a little....","但是那些最先醒来的士兵们，坐起身来，惊异地环视周围，还有时间思考一下……"
"Section 7","第七节"
"Everywhere there was laughter, everywhere tears.","四处欢声笑语，四处泪花四溅。"
"Men and women in the common life, finding themselves suddenly lit and exalted, capable of doing what had hitherto been impossible, incapable of doing what had hitherto been irresistible, happy, hopeful, unselfishly energetic, rejected altogether the supposition that this was merely a change in the blood and material texture of life.","平凡生活中的男男女女突然觉得自己容光焕发、精神抖擞。他们发现，迄今做不到的事情他们都游刃有余，而迄今不得不做的事情他们也可以置之不理了。他们满心愉悦，满怀希望，精力充沛，一致否认发生变化的仅仅是生命的血液和材料结构。"
"They denied the bodies God had given them, as once the Upper Nile savages struck out their canine teeth, because these made them like the beasts.","他们摒弃了上帝给予他们的身体，就像曾经尼罗河上游的野人们敲掉自己的犬牙，因为这些犬牙使他们看起来像野兽。"
"They declared that this was the coming of a spirit, and nothing else would satisfy their need for explanations.","他们宣称这是某种精神的来临，再没别的什么能将这一切解释清楚。"
"And in a sense the Spirit came.","而且从某个意义上来说，是圣灵到来了。"
"The Great Revival sprang directly from the Change—the last, the deepest, widest, and most enduring of all the vast inundations of religious emotion that go by that name.","这场巨变直接导致了伟大复兴——这是以巨变的名义发生的最后、最深远、最广泛、最持久的宗教情绪的大泛滥。"
"But indeed it differed essentially from its innumerable predecessors.","但这次宗教复兴与以往无数的复兴有着本质的区别。"
"The former revivals were a phase of fever, this was the first movement of health, it was altogether quieter, more intellectual, more private, more religious than any of those others.","此前的复兴都是一时的头脑发热，而这是首次健康的运动。相比之下，这次复兴总体上更为平静、更为理智、更为个人化、更富宗教性。"
"In the old time, and more especially in the Protestant countries where the things of religion were outspoken, and the absence of confession and well-trained priests made religious states of emotion explosive and contagious, revivalism upon various scales was a normal phase in the religious life, revivals were always going on—now a little disturbance of consciences in a village, now an evening of emotion in a Mission Room, now a great storm that swept a continent, and now an organized effort that came to town with bands and banners and handbills and motor-cars for the saving of souls.","过去，特别是清教国家，宗教活动都是外显的。由于不需要忏悔，又缺乏训练有素的牧师，这使得人们的宗教情绪十分高涨且富于感染力。各种规模的复兴是宗教生活的一个正常阶段，复兴活动总是在不停地进行着——时而是一个小村庄里良心的骚动，时而是布道厅内一夜的激情澎湃，时而是横扫整个大陆的风暴，时而是带着乐队、打着横幅、发着传单、开着汽车向市中心进发的有组织的活动，为的是拯救灵魂。"
"Never at any time did I take part in nor was I attracted by any of these movements.","我从未参加过这样的活动，也从不感兴趣。"
"My nature, although passionate, was too critical (or sceptical if you like, for it amounts to the same thing) and shy to be drawn into these whirls; but on several occasions Parload and I sat, scoffing, but nevertheless disturbed, in the back seats of revivalist meetings.","我的本性，尽管多情，但太过挑剔（如果你喜欢说成多疑也行，反正是一码事）和腼腆，因此不会被卷入这些漩涡中。但是我和帕罗德参加过几次宗教复兴的会议，我们两个坐在后排嘲弄这些复兴活动，但是遭到了阻挠。"
"I saw enough of them to understand their nature, and I am not surprised to learn now that before the comet came, all about the world, even among savages, even among cannibals, these same, or at any rate closely similar, periodic upheavals went on.","这样的人我见多了，足以看透他们的本性。因此现在得知在彗星到来前，在世界各地——即便是野人和食人者的生活中——同样或极其类似的周期性动荡时有发生，我就一点也不觉得奇怪了。"
"The world was stifling; it was in a fever, and these phenomena were neither more nor less than the instinctive struggle of the organism against the ebb of its powers, the clogging of its veins, the limitation of its life.","世界沉闷不堪；它陷入狂热，而这些现象正如有机体面对渐弱的体能，堵塞的静脉和生命的大限所做出的本能的抗争。"
"Invariably these revivals followed periods of sordid and restricted living.","这样的复兴总是紧随着堕落的、饱受限制的生活发生。"
"Men obeyed their base immediate motives until the world grew unendurably bitter.","人们本着基本的直接的动机生存着，直到世界的苦难变得无法忍受。"
"Some disappointment, some thwarting, lit up for them—darkly indeed, but yet enough for indistinct vision—the crowded squalor, the dark inclosure of life.","些许失望，些许挫败为他们照亮了——尽管昏暗，但足以看到模糊的影像——生活的污秽与禁锢。"
"A sudden disgust with the insensate smallness of the old-world way of living, a realization of sin, a sense of the unworthiness of all individual things, a desire for something comprehensive, sustaining, something greater, for wider communions and less habitual things, filled them.","一种对旧世界毫无生气、狭隘渺小的生活方式突然的厌恶，一种对罪孽的认识，一种对所有个人事务的无价值感，一种对更广泛、更持久、更伟大的事物、对更广泛的交流和更少俗事的渴望，充斥着人们的内心。"
"Their souls, which were shaped for wider issues, cried out suddenly amidst the petty interests, the narrow prohibitions, of life, “Not this!","他们重塑后的灵魂关注更广泛的事务，他们在生活的蝇头小利和狭隘禁令中突然呐喊道：“不要这样！"
"not this!”","不要这样！”"
"A great passion to escape from the jealous prison of themselves, an inarticulate, stammering, weeping passion shook them....","一种意欲逃离个人嫉妒的牢笼的伟大激情，一种无法言喻、催人泪下的激情震撼了他们……"
"I have seen—I remember how once in Clayton Calvinistic Methodist chapel I saw—his spotty fat face strangely distorted under the flickering gas-flares—old Pallet the ironmonger repent.","我看到过——我记得有次是在克莱顿的加尔文教派卫理公会的小教堂里——老帕利特，一个五金商，是如何忏悔的——他肥胖的麻脸在摇曳的火光映照下奇怪地扭曲着。"
"He went to the form of repentance, a bench reserved for such exhibitions, and slobbered out his sorrow and disgust for some sexual indelicacy—he was a widower—and I can see now how his loose fat body quivered and swayed with his grief.","他走向忏悔席——一个为这种忏悔而准备的长凳——然后情深意长地道出他的悲痛和对一些粗俗性行为的厌恶——他是个鳏夫——我现在还记得起他松弛肥胖的身躯是如何随着他的悲痛战栗摇摆。"
"He poured it out to five hundred people, from whom in common times he hid his every thought and purpose.","他面对着五百来个观众大肆倾吐，而平时他从不向他们显露任何想法和意图。"
"And it is a fact, it shows where reality lay, that we two youngsters laughed not at all at that blubbering grotesque, we did not even think the distant shadow of a smile.","这是事实，而且它揭示了现实所在，因此我们两个年轻人完全没有嘲笑那怪诞的哭诉，甚至连一丝笑意都没有。"
"We two sat grave and intent—perhaps wondering.","我们两个严肃而专注地坐着——或许在琢磨什么。"
"Only afterward and with an effort did we scoff....","只是到后来我们才费劲地笑起来……"
"Those old-time revivals were, I say, the convulsive movements of a body that suffocates.","我觉得，过去那些复兴运动不过是窒息的躯体做出的痉挛反应。"
"They are the clearest manifestations from before the Change of a sense in all men that things were not right.","这些运动是巨变发生前，人们心中的一种意识最清晰的显现，他们觉得什么事都不对劲了。"
"But they were too often but momentary illuminations.","但是这些都只是频繁且短暂的灵光乍现。"
"Their force spent itself in inco-ordinated shouting, gesticulations, tears.","他们的力量挥霍在杂乱无章的叫嚣、手势和眼泪上。"
"They were but flashes of outlook.","他们不过是美景的闪现。"
"Disgust of the narrow life, of all baseness, took shape in narrowness and baseness.","对狭隘生活和所有低贱鄙俗的厌恶本来就脱胎于狭隘和鄙俗。"
"The quickened soul ended the night a hypocrite; prophets disputed for precedence; seductions, it is altogether indisputable, were frequent among penitents!","苏醒的灵魂结束了伪善的黑夜；预言家们为优先权争论不休；诱奸毫无争议，而为此忏悔的人不在少数！"
"and Ananias went home converted and returned with a falsified gift.","于是亚拿尼亚皈依了宗教回到家，带着一份伪造的礼物。"
"And it was almost universal that the converted should be impatient and immoderate, scornful of reason and a choice of expedients, opposed to balance, skill, and knowledge.","普遍的情况是，皈依的人应该不耐烦、傲慢、蔑视理性、崇尚权宜之计，反对和谐、技巧和知识。"
"Incontinently full of grace, like thin old wine-skins overfilled, they felt they must burst if once they came into contact with hard fact and sane direction.","无节制的优雅和风度，就像是被塞得满满的又旧又薄的皮袋。一旦触碰到严酷的现实或者受到理智引导，他们便觉得自己一定会崩溃。"
"So the former revivals spent themselves, but the Great Revival did not spend itself, but grew to be, for the majority of Christendom at least, the permanent expression of the Change.","因此，此前的复兴都销声匿迹了，而这次的伟大复兴却没有，而是成为了这次巨变的永久印记，至少对大部分基督徒们而言是如此。"
"For many it has taken the shape of an outright declaration that this was the Second Advent—it is not for me to discuss the validity of that suggestion, for nearly all it has amounted to an enduring broadening of all the issues of life....","对很多基督徒而言，这次巨变无疑是基督再次降临的宣告——我不会讨论这种看法是否合理，因为这次巨变基本上长久地拓宽了人们生活的方方面面。"
"Section 8","第八节"
"One irrelevant memory comes back to me, irrelevant, and yet by some subtle trick of quality it summarizes the Change for me.","我想起一件毫无干系的事情来。然而，尽管没什么干系，但是这件事却微妙地为了总结了这次巨变。"
"It is the memory of a woman’s very beautiful face, a woman with a flushed face and tear-bright eyes who went by me without speaking, rapt in some secret purpose.","这是关于一个女人的漂亮脸蛋的记忆。她当时从我身边走过，脸颊泛红，双眼泪光闪闪，一言不发，怀揣着什么秘密心思，十分专注。"
"I passed her when in the afternoon of the first day, struck by a sudden remorse, I went down to Menton to send a telegram to my mother telling her all was well with me.","与她擦肩而过，我突然生出懊悔之感，那是巨变后第一天的下午。我当时是去芒通发电报给母亲，告诉她我一切都好。"
"Whither this woman went I do not know, nor whence she came; I never saw her again, and only her face, glowing with that new and luminous resolve, stands out for me....","我不到这个女人去了哪里，也不知道她从哪儿来的。我再没见过她，只是她那张闪烁着刚毅光芒的脸庞，深刻地留在了我的脑海……"
"But that expression was the world’s.","但是那个表情却是世人共有的。"

"Chapter the Third","第三章"
"The Cabinet Council","内阁会议"
"Section 1","第一节"
"AND what a strange unprecedented thing was that cabinet council at which I was present, the council that was held two days later in Melmount’s bungalow, and which convened the conference to frame the constitution of the World State.","我参加的内阁会议真是前所未有的最怪的一次。两天后在梅尔蒙特的平房里还举行了一次，讨论构建世界格局的事情。"
"I was there because it was convenient for me to stay with Melmount.","我在那儿是为了方便和梅尔蒙特呆在一起。"
"I had nowhere to go particularly, and there was no one at his bungalow, to which his broken ankle confined him, but a secretary and a valet to help him to begin his share of the enormous labors that evidently lay before the rulers of the world.","我无处可去，而他的平房里也没人。他因为脚踝受伤，只能待在房里。但是有个秘书和仆人帮他做一些事情。在这位世界的统治者眼前，无疑摆着他的一份事务。"
"I wrote shorthand, and as there was not even a phonograph available, I went in so soon as his ankle had been dressed, and sat at his desk to write at his dictation.","我负责速记。因为当时连个留声机都没有，因此他的脚踝一包扎好我就进去坐在他书桌旁给他做笔录。"
"It is characteristic of the odd slackness that went with the spasmodic violence of the old epoch, that the secretary could not use shorthand and that there was no telephone whatever in the place.","旧时代的特征，除了时不时的暴力事件、秘书不会速记、到处没有电话之外，还有古怪的懒惰。"
"Every message had to be taken to the village post-office in that grocer’s shop at Menton, half a mile away....","所有的信件都必须带到半英里外芒通的那家杂货铺的村庄邮局去……"
"So I sat in the back of Melmount’s room, his desk had been thrust aside, and made such memoranda as were needed.","于是我坐在梅尔蒙特房间的后边——他的写字台早被推到旁边去了——做一些必要的备忘。"
"At that time his room seemed to me the most beautifully furnished in the world, and I could identify now the vivid cheerfulness of the chintz of the sofa on which the great statesman lay just in front of me, the fine rich paper, the red sealing-wax, the silver equipage of the desk I used.","那时我觉得他的房子是世界上装修得最漂亮的了。我到现在还记得沙发罩着鲜艳的、令人愉悦印花棉布。那位伟大的政治家躺在沙发上，就在我面前。我还记得那些上好的纸张，红色的封蜡和桌上我用过的银质用具。"
"I know now that my presence in that room was a strange and remarkable thing, the open door, even the coming and going of Parker the secretary, innovations.","现在我才知道我的出席本身就是件奇怪而异常的事。还有打开的门，甚至是进进出出的秘书帕克，都是十分新奇的。"
"In the old days a cabinet council was a secret conclave, secrecy and furtiveness were in the texture of all public life.","以前内阁会议都是秘密召开。所有公众生活都是偷偷摸摸、鬼鬼祟祟的。"
"In the old days everybody was always keeping something back from somebody, being wary and cunning, prevaricating, misleading—for the most part for no reason at all.","过去人们总是会隐瞒一些事情，机警狡猾、敷衍搪塞、误导别人——很多时候都是毫无缘由的。"
"Almost unnoticed, that secrecy had dropped out of life.","而在毫无知觉之下，这些秘密就被抛诸于生命之外。"
"I close my eyes and see those men again, hear their deliberating voices.","我闭上眼又看到了那些人，听到他们从容、谨慎的声音。"
"First I see them a little diffusely in the cold explicitness of daylight, and then concentrated and drawn together amidst the shadow and mystery about shaded lamps.","开始时他们在清冷的日光中显得有点儿涣散，后来在昏暗灯光下的阴影和神秘中，他们都全神贯注，专心致志起来。"
"Integral to this and very clear is the memory of biscuit crumbs and a drop of spilt water, that at first stood shining upon and then sank into the green table-cloth....","此外我还清楚地记得饼干屑和一滴洒出来的水。那滴水起初在桌布上反射出光芒，而后渗进了绿色桌布。"
"I remember particularly the figure of Lord Adisham.","艾迪沙姆勋爵我记得尤为清楚。"
"He came to the bungalow a day before the others, because he was Melmount’s personal friend.","他比其他人早来一天，因为他与梅尔蒙特私交甚好。"
"Let me describe this statesman to you, this one of the fifteen men who made the last war.","让我来描述一下这位政客吧，他是发动了最后一场战争的十五个人中的一个。"
"He was the youngest member of the Government, and an altogether pleasant and sunny man of forty.","他是政府里最年轻的了，年届四十，十分亲切爽朗。"
"He had a clear profile to his clean gray face, a smiling eye, a friendly, careful voice upon his thin, clean-shaven lips, an easy disabusing manner.","他轮廓分明，容貌干净，脸色偏灰，眼含笑意，说话谨慎友善，嘴唇很薄，胡子剃得很干净，举止平易近人。"
"He had the perfect quality of a man who had fallen easily into a place prepared for him.","他具备了作为了一名男人最优秀的品质——随遇而安。"
"He had the temperament of what we used to call a philosopher—an indifferent, that is to say.","他拥有我们过去说的哲学家的气质——也就是冷漠无情。"
"The Change had caught him at his week-end recreation, fly-fishing; and, indeed, he said, I remember, that he recovered to find himself with his head within a yard of the water’s brim.","巨变发生时，他正在进行他周末的娱乐活动——用假蝇钓鱼。还有，我记得他说过他醒来后发现自己的头离水边不足一码。"
"In times of crisis Lord Adisham invariably went fly-fishing at the week-end to keep his mind in tone, and when there was no crisis then there was nothing he liked so much to do as fly-fishing, and so, of course, as there was nothing to prevent it, he fished.","危机爆发的时候，艾迪沙姆勋爵周末一定会去用假蝇钓鱼，以保持头脑清醒；而没有危机的时候，他最喜欢做的事情也就是假蝇钓鱼了。当然也就没什么能够阻止他钓鱼了。"
"He came resolved, among other things, to give up fly-fishing altogether.","左右权衡之下，他决心彻底放弃钓鱼。"
"I was present when he came to Melmount, and heard him say as much; and by a more naive route it was evident that he had arrived at the same scheme of intention as my master.","我听到他如是说。他来梅尔蒙特这里跟他说时，我正好在场，很明显，他来这里的意图和梅尔蒙特是一样的。"
"I left them to talk, but afterward I came back to take down their long telegrams to their coming colleagues.","我离开以便于他们谈话，而后又回来记下他们长长的电报，用来发给他们那些即将到来的同僚。"
"He was, no doubt, as profoundly affected as Melmount by the Change, but his tricks of civility and irony and acceptable humor had survived the Change, and he expressed his altered attitude, his expanded emotions, in a quaint modification of the old-time man-of-the-world style, with excessive moderation, with a trained horror of the enthusiasm that swayed him.","毋庸置疑，他和梅尔蒙特一样，深受巨变的影响。然而，他的优雅讽刺的小伎俩和尚可接受的幽默却丝毫未受影响。他叙述自己变化的态度和开阔的心绪，方式有点儿像旧时饱经世故者，极其谦虚和热情。"
"These fifteen men who ruled the British Empire were curiously unlike anything I had expected, and I watched them intently whenever my services were not in request.","奇怪的是，这十五个统治了大英帝国的人与我的想象相去甚远。只要一有闲暇，我便专心致志地看着他们。"
"They made a peculiar class at that time, these English politicians and statesmen, a class that has now completely passed away.","这些英国政治家和政客们，在当时是一个特别的阶层，然后现在这个阶层已经消失得无影无踪了。"
"In some respects they were unlike the statesmen of any other region of the world, and I do not find that any really adequate account remains of them....","从某些方面来说，他们和世界上其他地区的政客们不一样。可我没发现有任何关于他们的完整确切描述存留下来……"
"Perhaps you are a reader of the old books.","或许你是古书读者。"
"If so, you will find them rendered with a note of hostile exaggeration by Dickens in “Bleak House,” with a mingling of gross flattery and keen ridicule by Disraeli, who ruled among them accidentally by misunderstanding them and pleasing the court, and all their assumptions are set forth, portentously, perhaps, but truthfully, so far as people of the “permanent official” class saw them, in the novels of Mrs. Humphry Ward.","如果是这样的话，你将会发现狄更斯在《荒凉山庄》中用一种厌恶的夸张口吻来描绘他们。通过曲解别人和取悦宫廷而意外地成为其中一员的斯雷利，则对他们既有粗俗的谄媚，又有尖刻的讽刺。在汉弗莱·沃德夫人的小说中，正如“终身官员”阶层的人们看到的，他们的设想全都提出来了，可能是有预兆的，但事实如此。"
"All these books are still in this world and at the disposal of the curious, and in addition the philosopher Bagehot and the picturesque historian Macaulay give something of their method of thinking, the novelist Thackeray skirts the seamy side of their social life, and there are some good passages of irony, personal descriptions, and reminiscence to be found in the “Twentieth Century Garner” from the pens of such writers, for example, as Sidney Low.","所有这些书都还存留在世上，感兴趣的人随时可以找得到。另外，哲学家白哲特和文笔斐然的历史学家麦考利曾对他们的思维方式进行过描述。小说家萨克雷则刻画了他们社交生活肮脏丑恶的一面。在《二十世纪文库》中能找到一些出自西德尼·洛之类的作家之手的一些不错的讽刺性文章，人物描写和回忆录。"
"But a picture of them as a whole is wanting.","但从总体上来看，对这些政客的描述有待完善。"
"Then they were too near and too great; now, very rapidly, they have become incomprehensible.","他们都太类似且伟大，很快，到现在他们就已经变得不可理解了。"
"We common people of the old time based our conception of our statesmen almost entirely on the caricatures that formed the most powerful weapon in political controversy.","以前我们普通民众对政治家们的概念基本上完全基于漫画，漫画是政治斗争最强有力的武器。"
"Like almost every main feature of the old condition of things these caricatures were an unanticipated development, they were a sort of parasitic outgrowth from, which had finally altogether replaced, the thin and vague aspirations of the original democratic ideals.","像绝大多数的其他事物一样，漫画也历经了意想不到的发展。它们产生于人们对最初的民主理想的蒙眬的渴望，而最终被完全替代。"
"They presented not only the personalities who led our public life, but the most sacred structural conceptions of that life, in ludicrous, vulgar, and dishonorable aspects that in the end came near to destroying entirely all grave and honorable emotion or motive toward the State.","它们不仅展现领导公众生活的人物，还有对那种公众生活所持的最为神圣的结构观念。最后，这些漫画的滑稽、粗俗和卑鄙将人们对于国家的高尚、崇敬的情感全部瓦解掉了。"
"The state of Britain was represented nearly always by a red-faced, purse-proud farmer with an enormous belly, that fine dream of freedom, the United States, by a cunning, lean-faced rascal in striped trousers and a blue coat.","大英帝国几乎总是以一个红光满面、大腹便便的拜金农民的形象为代表；而梦想着自由的美国则是以狡黠干瘦、身着背带裤蓝外套的流氓形象为代表。"
"The chief ministers of state were pickpockets, washerwomen, clowns, whales, asses, elephants, and what not, and issues that affected the welfare of millions of men were dressed and judged like a rally in some idiotic pantomime.","内阁首脑人物的形象都是些扒手、洗衣女工、小丑、鲸鱼、驴、大象和其他乱七八糟的东西。影响着百万民众的福利政策，则像某些白痴哑剧中的人物集合般被粉饰和评判。"
"A tragic war in South Africa, that wrecked many thousand homes, impoverished two whole lands, and brought death and disablement to fifty thousand men, was presented as a quite comical quarrel between a violent queer being named Chamberlain, with an eyeglass, an orchid, and a short temper, and “old Kroojer,” an obstinate and very cunning old man in a shocking bad hat.","南非的一场悲惨战争摧毁了成千上万的家园，使得两个国家都陷于贫困，死伤五万人。这场战争被描述成一场滑稽的口角，一方是头戴兰花、单只眼戴着眼镜、脾气火爆而残暴的同性恋者张伯伦；另一方是头戴烂帽、顽固不化、老奸巨猾的“老克鲁杰”。"
"The conflict was carried through in a mood sometimes of brutish irritability and sometimes of lax slovenliness, the merry speculator plied his trade congenially in that asinine squabble, and behind these fooleries and masked by them, marched Fate—until at last the clowning of the booth opened and revealed—hunger and suffering, brands burning and swords and shame....","冲突进行得时而紧张血腥时而散漫拖沓。窃喜的投机者从这场愚蠢的口角中渔利。在这些愚蠢的行为背后，命运借此掩人耳目悄然而至——直到最后真相大白——饥饿、痛苦、燃烧的旗帜、刀剑还有屈辱……"
"These men had come to fame and power in that atmosphere, and to me that day there was the oddest suggestion in them of actors who have suddenly laid aside grotesque and foolish parts; the paint was washed from their faces, the posing put aside.","这些人借此集名望与权势于一身。然而对我来说，他们身上有着表演者最为奇怪的特征，尽管他们在一时之间摈弃了怪诞愚蠢的角色，脸上的油彩也已洗去，亦不再伪装。"
"Even when the presentation was not frankly grotesque and degrading it was entirely misleading.","即使这些漫画所表现的并非十足的滑稽低俗，但却完全是误导性的。"
"When I read of Laycock, for example, there arises a picture of a large, active, if a little wrong-headed, intelligence in a compact heroic body, emitting that “Goliath” speech of his that did so much to precipitate hostilities, it tallies not at all with the stammering, high-pitched, slightly bald, and very conscience-stricken personage I saw, nor with Melmount’s contemptuous first description of him.","比如说，当我读到描绘“莱科克”的漫画时，映入眼帘的图画是体型庞大、积极活跃、智勇双全的人物，如果有点判断失误的话。此人的“巨人哥利亚”演讲重复了那么多次，人们都厌恶了。这个形象和我所见的说话结巴、嗓音尖细、头顶微秃、深受良心谴责的人物迥然相异，也和梅尔蒙特第一次对他进行的轻蔑描述不相符。"
"I doubt if the world at large will ever get a proper vision of those men as they were before the Change.","我很怀疑世人是否能够真正了解巨变前人们的样子。"
"Each year they pass more and more incredibly beyond our intellectual sympathy.","他们每一年都越来越超出人们的理智上的同情。"
"Our estrangement cannot, indeed, rob them of their portion in the past, but it will rob them of any effect of reality.","我们对他们的疏离无法剥夺他们昔日的地位，但是却将剥夺他们的现实影响力。"
"The whole of their history becomes more and more foreign, more and more like some queer barbaric drama played in a forgotten tongue.","他们的整个历史变得越来越陌生，越来越像用异国语言表演的某种诡诞粗野的戏剧。"
"There they strut through their weird metamorphoses of caricature, those premiers and presidents, their height preposterously exaggerated by political buskins, their faces covered by great resonant inhuman masks, their voices couched in the foolish idiom of public utterance, disguised beyond any semblance to sane humanity, roaring and squeaking through the public press.","那些首相和总统们从怪异畸形的漫画中大摇大摆地走出来。他们因为政治高筒靴而显得异常高大，他们戴着共鸣良好的非人性面具，他们发表着愚蠢的公众演讲，伪装出来的假象骗过了所有头脑清醒的人们，在公众媒体间叫嚣轰鸣。"
"There it stands, this incomprehensible faded show, a thing left on one side, and now still and deserted by any interest, its many emptinesses as inexplicable now as the cruelties of medieval Venice, the theology of old Byzantium.","这场无法理解、日渐褪色的表演矗立在此，被遗弃一旁无人问津。它的许多空白如同中世纪威尼斯的酷刑和古老拜占庭的神学一样无法解释。"
"And they ruled and influenced the lives of nearly a quarter of mankind, these politicians, their clownish conflicts swayed the world, made mirth perhaps, made excitement, and permitted—infinite misery.","这些政治家们统治并影响着将近四分之一的人类的生命。他们滑稽的冲突控制这世界，其间或许有欢笑，或许也有激情，但也有无尽的痛苦。"
"I saw these men quickened indeed by the Change, but still wearing the queer clothing of the old time, the manners and conventions of the old time; if they had disengaged themselves from the outlook of the old time they still had to refer back to it constantly as a common starting-point.","我看到这次巨变确实使这些人变得更为活跃，但他们仍旧穿着旧时代的怪异服装，举止言行也和原来一样。如果他们完全从过去时代样子的脱离出来，他们还是不得不时不时地援引过去，作为一个共同的出发点。"
"My refreshed intelligence was equal to that, so that I think I did indeed see them.","我全新的智力能适应这些，因此我认为我确实看到他们了。"
"There was Gorrell-Browning, the Chancellor of the Duchy; I remember him as a big round-faced man, the essential vanity and foolishness of whose expression, whose habit of voluminous platitudinous speech, triumphed absurdly once or twice over the roused spirit within.","公爵领地大臣戈里·布朗宁，我记得他脸庞硕大浑圆，一脸的自负和愚蠢，习惯废话连篇，满口陈词滥调，而这些废话竟然有一两次荒谬地胜过了其内心觉醒的良知。"
"He struggled with it, he burlesqued himself, and laughed.","他挣扎、自嘲而后大笑起来。"
"Suddenly he said simply, intensely—it was a moment for every one of clean, clear pain, “I have been a vain and self-indulgent and presumptuous old man.","突然他动情而简洁地说道——那一刻，所有人心里都隐隐作痛——“一直以来我都是个无能、我行我素、肆无忌惮的老头子。"
"I am of little use here.","我在这儿已经没什么用了。"
"I have given myself to politics and intrigues, and life is gone from me.”","我一辈子都在权力场上钩心斗角，我的生命已经消耗殆尽了。”"
"Then for a long time he sat still.","之后他便默默地坐了很久。"
"There was Carton, the Lord Chancellor, a white-faced man with understanding, he had a heavy, shaven face that might have stood among the busts of the Caesars, a slow, elaborating voice, with self-indulgent, slightly oblique, and triumphant lips, and a momentary, voluntary, humorous twinkle.","卡顿是勋爵。他脸很白净、善解人意。沉郁的、刮过胡须的脸和凯撒大帝的半身塑像相差无几。他说话慢条斯理、清晰详尽，唇线有点儿斜，还时不时不由自主地小幽默一番。"
"“We have to forgive,” he said.","“我们得宽恕，”他说，"
"“We have to forgive—even ourselves.”","“我们得宽恕——甚至我们自己。”"
"These two were at the top corner of the table, so that I saw their faces well.","他们两个人坐在桌子的上角，因此他们的脸我看得很清楚。"
"Madgett, the Home Secretary, a smaller man with wrinkled eyebrows and a frozen smile on his thin wry mouth, came next to Carton; he contributed little to the discussion save intelligent comments, and when the electric lights above glowed out, the shadows deepened queerly in his eye-sockets and gave him the quizzical expression of an ironical goblin.","紧挨着卡顿坐着的是内政部秘书马奇特。他身材矮小，眉头紧锁，歪曲的嘴角对着一丝凝固的笑容。他很少参与讨论，偶尔发表些有见地的评论。当头顶上端的电灯亮起，他眼窝下的阴影变得更深，活像一只讽刺的鬼灵的滑稽表情。"
"Next him was that great peer, the Earl of Richover, whose self-indulgent indolence had accepted the role of a twentieth-century British Roman patrician of culture, who had divided his time almost equally between his jockeys, politics, and the composition of literary studies in the key of his role.","他旁边的是非凡的贵族里乔维尔伯爵。他随心所欲、慵懒散漫，像二十世纪的英罗马贵族。他将时间基本上平分做这么几件事：骑马，参政和研究文学。"
"“We have done nothing worth doing,” he said.","“我们做的事情都不值得做，”他说，"
"“As for me, I have cut a figure!”","“至于我，我已经出尽风头了！”"
"He reflected—no doubt on his ample patrician years, on the fine great houses that had been his setting, the teeming race-courses that had roared his name, the enthusiastic meetings he had fed with fine hopes, the futile Olympian beginnings....","他陷入沉思——无疑是在回忆过去富裕的贵族生活，过去精美豪华的住所，欢呼着他的名号的跑马场，他倾注了美好希望的热情洋溢的会议，无用的庄严的开始……"
"“I have been a fool,” he said compactly.","“我一直就是个傻瓜，”他铮铮地说。"
"They heard him in a sympathetic and respectful silence.","人们静静地听他说，满怀同情和敬重。"
"Gurker, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, was partially occulted, so far as I was concerned, by the back of Lord Adisham.","格克，财政大臣。他被艾迪沙姆勋爵的背部挡住了，我只看得他部分身体。"
"Ever and again Gurker protruded into the discussion, swaying forward, a deep throaty voice, a big nose, a coarse mouth with a drooping everted lower lip, eyes peering amidst folds and wrinkles.","格克向前晃动着，时不时地插入讨论。他的声音低沉嘶哑，鼻头很大，嘴巴粗糙，耷拉着下嘴唇，眼睛在一堆的皱纹中凝视着。"
"He made his confession for his race.","他为他们种族做忏悔。"
"“We Jews,” he said, “have gone through the system of this world, creating nothing, consolidating many things, destroying much.","“我们犹太人，”他说，“历经了这个世界的体制，无所作为，巩固了许多东西，却也毁灭了许多。"
"Our racial self-conceit has been monstrous.","我们种族向来都是极其自满的。"
"We seem to have used our ample coarse intellectuality for no other purpose than to develop and master and maintain the convention of property, to turn life into a sort of mercantile chess and spend our winnings grossly....","我们看来仅仅是将自己丰富而粗糙的智慧用于发展、掌控和保持我们的既得财产，将生活变成某种商业博弈，大肆挥霍胜利品……"
"We have had no sense of service to mankind.","我们从没有服务人类的意识。"
"Beauty which is godhead—we made it a possession.”","美是神性的——我们却将其视为财产。”"
"These men and these sayings particularly remain in my memory.","这些人和他们的言论都深深地留在我记忆中。"
"Perhaps, indeed, I wrote them down at the time, but that I do not now remember.","可能我当时真的记录下来了，但是现在我完全想不起来。"
"How Sir Digby Privet, Revel, Markheimer, and the others sat I do not now recall; they came in as voices, interruptions, imperfectly assigned comments....","我记不得迪格林·普里维特先生、雷维尔先生、马克海默先生和其他人是怎么做的了。残存的只有他们的声音、插的话和不太适宜的评论……"
"One got a queer impression that except perhaps for Gurker or Revel these men had not particularly wanted the power they held; had desired to do nothing very much in the positions they had secured.","大概除了格克和雷维尔，没有人特别想要手中的权力，只想呆在他们的位置上无所事事。这给人们留下很奇怪的印象。"
"They had found themselves in the cabinet, and until this moment of illumination they had not been ashamed; but they had made no ungentlemanly fuss about the matter.","他们发现身在内阁，在这如梦初醒的一刻到来之前，他们从未感到羞愧过；但对此他们也没有有失风度地大惊小怪。"
"Eight of that fifteen came from the same school, had gone through an entirely parallel education; some Greek linguistics, some elementary mathematics, some emasculated “science,” a little history, a little reading in the silent or timidly orthodox English literature of the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries, all eight had imbibed the same dull gentlemanly tradition of behavior; essentially boyish, unimaginative—with neither keen swords nor art in it, a tradition apt to slobber into sentiment at a crisis and make a great virtue of a simple duty rather clumsily done.","这十五个人里有八个人来自同一所学校，受到的是全然相同的教育；学了一些希腊语，一些初等数学，一些被阉割过的“科学”，还有一点儿历史，一点儿十七、十八、十九世纪的传统英国文学。这八个人都汲取了刻板绅士传统，实质上是幼稚且无趣的——这种传统，既无利刃也无艺术，面对灾难便黯然神伤，粗陋地完成了一点儿小任务便视之为高尚德行。"
"None of these eight had made any real experiments with life, they had lived in blinkers, they had been passed from nurse to governess, from governess to preparatory school, from Eton to Oxford, from Oxford to the politico-social routine.","他们这八个人从未真正体验过生活，他们一直都是盲目地生活。从托儿所到幼儿园，从幼儿园到小学，从伊顿公学到牛津大学，从牛津大学到政治社会，这是他们一成不变的路子。"
"Even their vices and lapses had been according to certain conceptions of good form.","即便是恶习和失误，都遵循特定的良好模式观念。"
"They had all gone to the races surreptitiously from Eton, had all cut up to town from Oxford to see life—music-hall life—had all come to heel again.","他们都曾偷偷从伊顿公学溜出去看赛马，从牛津大学跑出去享受生活——去听音乐会——然后又都循规蹈矩。"
"Now suddenly they discovered their limitations....","此时他们突然发现了自己的局限……"
"“What are we to do?”","“我们去做什么呢？”"
"asked Melmount.","梅尔蒙特问道，"
"“We have awakened; this empire in our hands....”","“我们都苏醒了。这个国家在我们手上……”"
"I know this will seem the most fabulous of all the things I have to tell of the old order, but, indeed, I saw it with my eyes, I heard it with my ears.","我知道这将会是我所讲述的旧秩序下所有事件中最难以置信的；但是，这确实是我亲眼所见亲耳所闻的事情。"
"It is a fact that this group of men who constituted the Government of one-fifth of the habitable land of the earth, who ruled over a million of armed men, who had such navies as mankind had never seen before, whose empire of nations, tongues, peoples still dazzles in these greater days, had no common idea whatever of what they meant to do with the world.","事实是，这群人完全没有共识，不知道要如何去管理他们所面对的这个世界。他们这群人曾组成了管辖地球五分之一可居住地的政府，曾掌控了一百多万大军和人类前所未有的浩大海军，他们的民族、语言和人们在现今的伟大时代依旧令人惊羡。"
"They had been a Government for three long years, and before the Change came to them it had never even occurred to them that it was necessary to have no common idea.","他们的政府维持了三年之久，在巨变来临之前，他们从未想过有达成共识的必要。"
"There was no common idea at all.","也从来没有过共识。"
"That great empire was no more than a thing adrift, an aimless thing that ate and drank and slept and bore arms, and was inordinately proud of itself because it had chanced to happen.","那个大帝国不过是个飘忽不定、漫无目的的东西。它只是吃、喝、睡、扛枪、为偶然的辉煌骄傲不已。"
"It had no plan, no intention; it meant nothing at all.","它没有任何计划或打算，它根本就毫无意义。"
"And the other great empires adrift, perilously adrift like marine mines, were in the self-same case.","而其他游荡着的帝国，像水雷一样危险地游荡着的帝国，也处于相同境况。"
"Absurd as a British cabinet council must seem to you now, it was no whit more absurd than the controlling ganglion, autocratic council, president’s committee, or what not, of each of its blind rivals....","在你看来，现在的大英内阁会议看起来也许十分可笑，但它并不比它敌对的独裁专制机构、总统委员会或其他什么更为荒谬……"
"Section 2","第二节"
"I remember as one thing that struck me very forcibly at the time, the absence of any discussion, any difference of opinion, about the broad principles of our present state.","我记得那时有件事情使我十分震惊，即关于我们目前国家的范适准则没有得到任何讨论或给出任何不同意见。"
"These men had lived hitherto in a system of conventions and acquired motives, loyalty to a party, loyalty to various secret agreements and understandings, loyalty to the Crown; they had all been capable of the keenest attention to precedence, all capable of the most complete suppression of subversive doubts and inquiries, all had their religious emotions under perfect control.","这些人一直以来都生活在传统体制和既定动机之下。他们尽忠于党派、各种秘密协议和理解和皇室，他们有能力对优先权给予最热切的关注，对颠覆性质疑和询问给予最彻底的镇压，并且完美地控制自己的宗教情感。"
"They had seemed protected by invisible but impenetrable barriers from all the heady and destructive speculations, the socialistic, republican, and communistic theories that one may still trace through the literature of the last days of the comet.","他们似乎被无形却无法逾越的壁垒保护着，隔绝所有顽固且毁灭性的理论，诸如社会主义、共和主义已经共产主义理论。这些理论至今仍能在彗星到来那个时代的文学中找到蛛丝马迹。"
"But now it was as if the very moment of the awakening those barriers and defences had vanished, as if the green vapors had washed through their minds and dissolved and swept away a hundred once rigid boundaries and obstacles.","但是现在那些壁垒和防御似乎在苏醒的那一刻全部消失了，似乎绿色气体洗涤了他们的头脑，化解清除了许许多多曾经顽固的界限和障碍。"
"They had admitted and assimilated at once all that was good in the ill-dressed propagandas that had clamored so vehemently and vainly at the doors of their minds in the former days.","他们立刻承认并吸收了所有没有宣传好的好东西。那些宣传曾在他们思想之门前激烈叫嚣过，但没有丝毫动静。"
"It was exactly like the awakening from an absurd and limiting dream.","这正像从一场荒谬短暂的梦中苏醒过来。"
"They had come out together naturally and inevitably upon the broad daylight platform of obvious and reasonable agreement upon which we and all the order of our world now stand.","他们自然而然地、不可避免地形成宽阔明亮的平台，在此达成明了合理的协议，在此基础上我们以及世界的秩序得以树立。"
"Let me try to give the chief things that had vanished from their minds.","且让我简述一下从他们心里消失的主要事物。"
"There was, first, the ancient system of “ownership” that made such an extraordinary tangle of our administration of the land upon which we lived.","首先是“所有制”这一古老的体制。这一体制给我们所居住的土地的管理造成的极度的混乱。"
"In the old time no one believed in that as either just or ideally convenient, but every one accepted it.","在旧时代，没有人会认为“所有制”公正或者便利，但每个人都接受了它。"
"The community which lived upon the land was supposed to have waived its necessary connection with the land, except in certain limited instances of highway and common.","居住于这篇陆地上的社会本已放弃了其与土地的必要联系，除了一些少量的公路和公共用地之外。"
"All the rest of the land was cut up in the maddest way into patches and oblongs and triangles of various sizes between a hundred square miles and a few acres, and placed under the nearly absolute government of a series of administrators called landowners.","剩下的所有土地都以最疯狂的方式被分割成大小不等的方形、长方形和三角形，面积大至上百平方英里小至几公顷。这些土地由一系列管理者近乎绝对地管辖起来，这些人被称为土地所有者。"
"They owned the land almost as a man now owns his hat; they bought it and sold it, and cut it up like cheese or ham; they were free to ruin it, or leave it waste, or erect upon it horrible and devastating eyesores.","他们拥有着土地，就像现在的人拥有一顶帽子一般，他们买卖土地，将其像奶酪和火腿般切割，他们可以任意毁坏、废弃或在上面建造可怕丑陋的建筑。"
"If the community needed a road or a tramway, if it wanted a town or a village in any position, nay, even if it wanted to go to and fro, it had to do so by exorbitant treaties with each of the monarchs whose territory was involved.","如果社区需要一条路和轨道，需要在某个位置建一座镇或村庄，甚至只是想借道来往，都必须与相应土地的领主签订代价高昂的协议。"
"No man could find foothold on the face of the earth until he had paid toll and homage to one of them.","没人能在地球上找到立足之地，除非他像某个土地所有者付税并对其效忠。"
"They had practically no relations and no duties to the nominal, municipal, or national Government amidst whose larger areas their own dominions lay....","这些土地所有者对名义上的地方或国家政府并不联系也无义务，尽管他们的领地在国家更为广大的区域内……"
"This sounds, I know, like a lunatic’s dream, but mankind was that lunatic; and not only in the old countries of Europe and Asia, where this system had arisen out of the rational delegation of local control to territorial magnates, who had in the universal baseness of those times at last altogether evaded and escaped their duties, did it obtain, but the “new countries,” as we called them then—the United States of America, the Cape Colony, Australia, and New Zealand—spent much of the nineteenth century in the frantic giving away of land for ever to any casual person who would take it.","我知道这听起来像痴人说梦，而人类就是这痴人。在欧洲和亚洲的古老国家，这种体制产生于对土地地主进行本土控制权的合理分配，而这些人最后全都卑鄙地逃避了自己的责任和义务；在我们所称为“新兴国家”的美国、好望角殖民地、澳大利亚和新西兰也是一样，他们将十九世纪大部分的时间都用来疯狂地分派土地给任何想要的人。"
"Was there coal, was there petroleum or gold, was there rich soil or harborage, or the site for a fine city, these obsessed and witless Governments cried out for scramblers, and a stream of shabby, tricky, and violent adventurers set out to found a new section of the landed aristocracy of the world.","如果哪里有煤炭、石油或者黄金，哪里土地肥沃或者是个天然港湾，哪里适合建造城市，这些鬼迷心窍、才疏学浅的政府人员便会召人开垦，于是邋遢、刁钻、野蛮的探险家们便会如潮水般涌去，成为这个世界上拥有土地的阶层的一个新部分。"
"After a brief century of hope and pride, the great republic of the United States of America, the hope as it was deemed of mankind, became for the most part a drifting crowd of landless men; landlords and railway lords, food lords (for the land is food) and mineral lords ruled its life, gave it Universities as one gave coins to a mendicant, and spent its resources upon such vain, tawdry, and foolish luxuries as the world had never seen before.","经过了短暂的充满希望和骄傲的一个世纪，伟大的美利坚合众国，被视为人类的希望，很大程度上成就了一群群没有土地的流浪者，土地大王、铁路大王、粮食大王（土地便是粮食）和矿产大王统治了整个国家的生计，他们兴办大学不过像施舍给乞丐铜板一样。他们还将国家资源大肆挥霍在世界上前所未有的毫无用处、花哨庸俗、愚蠢至极的奢侈品上。"
"Here was a thing none of these statesmen before the Change would have regarded as anything but the natural order of the world, which not one of them now regarded as anything but the mad and vanished illusion of a period of dementia.","巨变前，政治家们视此为世界最自然不过的秩序，而现在他们所有人都认为这是一段痴迷时期疯狂的但也已消逝的幻影。"
"And as it was with the question of the land, so was it also with a hundred other systems and institutions and complicated and disingenuous factors in the life of man.","土地所有者存在着上述的种种问题，许许多多其他的体制和机构以及人们生活中复杂虚伪的方方面面也都一样。"
"They spoke of trade, and I realized for the first time there could be buying and selling that was no loss to any man; they spoke of industrial organization, and one saw it under captains who sought no base advantages.","他们谈到交易，我第一次认识到买卖可以不给任何一方造成损失，他们谈到工业组织，人们可以从不追求不义之利的巨头们那里了解一切。"
"The haze of old associations, of personal entanglements and habitual recognitions had been dispelled from every stage and process of the social training of men.","陈旧关系、个人纠葛和习惯性认知的迷雾都从人们的社交培训的各阶段和过程中排除掉了。"
"Things long hidden appeared discovered with an amazing clearness and nakedness.","长久以来隐藏的事物重见天日，清晰赤裸得令人惊异。"
"These men who had awakened, laughed dissolvent laughs, and the old muddle of schools and colleges, books and traditions, the old fumbling, half-figurative, half-formal teaching of the Churches, the complex of weakening and confusing suggestions and hints, amidst which the pride and honor of adolescence doubted and stumbled and fell, became nothing but a curious and pleasantly faded memory.","这些人清醒过来，释然地笑了起来。过去混乱的院校、书本和传统，过去教会笨拙的半修辞半正经的教学，无力又使人困惑的建议与提示，年轻人的骄傲和荣誉曾在质疑、受挫中继而败落，现在，所有这些地方都已成了令人好奇的、愉快地淡忘了的记忆了。"
"“There must be a common training of the young,” said Richover; “a frank initiation.","“年轻人一定得普遍接受培训，”里乔维尔说，“一个坦率的开始。"
"We have not so much educated them as hidden things from them, and set traps.","对他们，我们向来都是隐瞒事情、设置陷阱，却没有好好教育他们。"
"And it might have been so easy—it can all be done so easily.”","这本来是很容易就办得到的事情——很容易就能办得到。”"
"That hangs in my memory as the refrain of that council, “It can all be done so easily,” but when they said it then, it came to my ears with a quality of enormous refreshment and power.","“很容易就能办得到”这句话在会议中被反复提到，以至于一直萦绕在我记忆里。但当时他们说的时候，我听起来还是觉得十分新鲜有力。"
"It can all be done so easily, given frankness, given courage.","很容易就能办得到，只要给予坦诚，只要给予勇气。"
"Time was when these platitudes had the freshness and wonder of a gospel.","当这些陈腔滥调有了一个信条的生气和魔力时，万事都不难办到了。"
"In this enlarged outlook the war with the Germans—that mythical, heroic, armed female, Germany, had vanished from men’s imaginations—was a mere exhausted episode.","从拓宽了的视域中来看，与德国人的战争只是一场已经结束的插曲——那个神话般的、英雄式的、武装起来的女性，德国，已经从人们的想象中消失了。"
"A truce had already been arranged by Melmount, and these ministers, after some marveling reminiscences, set aside the matter of peace as a mere question of particular arrangements....","梅尔蒙特已经安排好了停战，而这些大臣们在一番精彩的缅怀后，将和平之事视作只需特殊安排的问题搁置一旁……"
"The whole scheme of the world’s government had become fluid and provisional in their minds, in small details as in great, the unanalyzable tangle of wards and vestries, districts and municipalities, counties, states, boards, and nations, the interlacing, overlapping, and conflicting authorities, the felt of little interests and claims, in which an innumerable and insatiable multitude of lawyers, agents, managers, bosses, organizers lived like fleas in a dirty old coat, the web of the conflicts, jealousies, heated patchings up and jobbings apart, of the old order—they flung it all on one side.","世界政府的整套计划在他们看来都是不确定的和暂时的。事无巨细，病房与教区会、中央直辖区与自治区、镇、州、疆域与民族间的分析不了的纠葛，各权威间的联系、重叠与冲突，无数贪得无厌的律师、代理商、经理、老板和组织者们粘在蝇头小利的毛毡上如同一件又脏又旧的大衣上的跳蚤，旧秩序下的冲突、嫉妒和分分合合的林林总总——他们将旧世界全部扔到了一边。"
"“What are the new needs?”","“新的需求是什么呢？”"
"said Melmount.","梅尔蒙特说，"
"“This muddle is too rotten to handle.","“这个摊子太烂了，很难处理。"
"We’re beginning again.","我们要重新开始。"
"Well, let us begin afresh.”","好吧，让我们重头来过吧。”"
"Section 3","第三节"
"“Let us begin afresh!”","“让我们从头来过！”"
"This piece of obvious common sense seemed then to me instinct with courage, the noblest of words.","那时这一显而易见的常识对我来说多么需要勇气，这是多么伟大的话语！"
"My heart went out to him as he spoke.","当他说这番话的时候，我对他充满敬佩。"
"It was, indeed, that day as vague as it was valiant; we did not at all see the forms of what we were thus beginning.","事实上那天既模糊又伟大，我们完全不知道我们要开始的事情的形式。"
"All that we saw was the clear inevitableness that the old order should end....","我们看到的只有旧秩序是要不可避免地终结了。"
"And then in a little space of time mankind in halting but effectual brotherhood was moving out to make its world anew.","随后的一段时间里，人们在蹒跚但有力的兄弟情义中开始为创造新世界而行动起来。"
"Those early years, those first and second decades of the new epoch, were in their daily detail a time of rejoicing toil; one saw chiefly one’s own share in that, and little of the whole.","早些年，也就是新纪元的前一二十年，人们每天都快乐地劳作，每个人看到更多的是自己能做的贡献，很少关心全局。"
"It is only now that I look back at it all from these ripe years, from this high tower, that I see the dramatic sequence of its changes, see the cruel old confusions of the ancient time become clarified, simplified, and dissolve and vanish away.","只是如今身在收获的时代，站在这高塔上再回首时，我才看到那些变化带来的戏剧化结果，看到旧时代残忍陈旧的困惑变得清晰、简单，最后融化消失。"
"Where is that old world now?","如今，那个旧世界在那儿呢？"
"Where is London, that somber city of smoke and drifting darkness, full of the deep roar and haunting music of disorder, with its oily, shining, mud-rimmed, barge-crowded river, its black pinnacles and blackened dome, its sad wildernesses of smut-grayed houses, its myriads of draggled prostitutes, its millions of hurrying clerks?","伦敦在哪儿？那个昏暗的城市曾经满是烟雾和游动的黑暗，到处是低沉的吼叫和混乱轰响的音乐。那条浮着油污闪闪发亮、周围挤满淤泥、充塞着船只的河呢？城里黑色的小尖塔和变黑了的圆形屋顶呢？那些衰败荒芜的黑灰色房子呢？那些数不清的浑身湿漉漉妓女们呢？那些好几百万为生活忙碌的职员呢？"
"The very leaves upon its trees were foul with greasy black defilements.","树叶沾着油腻的黑色污秽而显得肮脏不堪。"
"Where is lime-white Paris, with its green and disciplined foliage, its hard unflinching tastefulness, its smartly organized viciousness, and the myriads of workers, noisily shod, streaming over the bridges in the gray cold light of dawn.","石灰白的巴黎在哪里？那绿意盎然的整齐的树叶，那一贯严苛的雅致，那巧妙规划好的邪恶，还有无数步履嘈杂、在灰暗冷清的曙光中涌过大桥的工人，这些都去哪儿了？"
"Where is New York, the high city of clangor and infuriated energy, wind swept and competition swept, its huge buildings jostling one another and straining ever upward for a place in the sky, the fallen pitilessly overshadowed.","纽约在哪里？这座喧嚣热闹、精力旺盛的高城；飓风袭来，竞争袭来，巨型建筑拔地而起，你推我攘地往上争夺天空的一席之地，落后的大楼只能无人怜悯地暗自神伤。"
"Where are its lurking corners of heavy and costly luxury, the shameful bludgeoning bribing vice of its ill ruled underways, and all the gaunt extravagant ugliness of its strenuous life?","城市里暗藏贵重奢侈品的角落、暗地里无耻的令人震撼的贿赂恶行、还有纸醉金迷挥霍无度的丑恶都到哪里去了？"
"And where now is Philadelphia, with its innumerable small and isolated homes, and Chicago with its interminable blood-stained stockyards, its polyglot underworld of furious discontent.","此时有着无数偏僻的小房子的费城在哪里呢？有着冗长的血迹斑斑的牲畜围栏和语言混杂、充斥着愤怒和不满的地下世界的芝加哥呢？"
"All these vast cities have given way and gone, even as my native Potteries and the Black Country have gone, and the lives that were caught, crippled, starved, and maimed amidst their labyrinths, their forgotten and neglected maladjustments, and their vast, inhuman, ill-conceived industrial machinery have escaped—to life.","所有这些大型城市都消失了，甚至连我家乡的陶瓷厂和黑人村庄都没了踪影。那些曾经因为被俘、残疾、挨饿和深受重伤等而陷入绝境的人们，这些城市被人遗忘和忽视的失衡，还有其间巨大的、没有人性的、心怀鬼胎的工业机器都消失了。"
"Those cities of growth and accident are altogether gone, never a chimney smokes about our world to-day, and the sound of the weeping of children who toiled and hungered, the dull despair of overburdened women, the noise of brute quarrels in alleys, all shameful pleasures and all the ugly grossness of wealthy pride have gone with them, with the utter change in our lives.","那些膨胀的、事故频发的城市全都消失了。现今世界，烟囱不再冒烟，疲倦饥饿的孩子们号啕大哭的声音、不堪重负的妇女们麻木的绝望、胡同里粗鲁的争吵声、富人们可耻的趣味和丑恶的庸俗都随着我们生活翻天覆地的变化消失了。"
"As I look back into the past I see a vast exultant dust of house-breaking and removal rise up into the clear air that followed the hour of the green vapors, I live again the Year of Tents, the Year of Scaffolding, and like the triumph of a new theme in a piece of music—the great cities of our new days arise.","回首往昔，我看到一颗巨大欢快的尘埃冲破房屋，进随着绿色气体升向清澈的天空，我如同再次生活在坦兹时代和斯卡福丁时代，我们新时代的伟大城市如同一片乐章中新的主题的胜利一般崛起。"
"Come Caerlyon and Armedon, the twin cities of lower England, with the winding summer city of the Thames between, and I see the gaunt dirt of old Edinburgh die to rise again white and tall beneath the shadow of her ancient hill; and Dublin too, reshaped, returning enriched, fair, spacious, the city of rich laughter and warm hearts, gleaming gaily in a shaft of sunlight through the soft warm rain.","卡尔顿和亚美顿这两座位于英格兰南部的孪生城市，其间是泰晤士河边蜿蜒的夏日城市。我看到爱丁堡老城从荒凉的尘埃上重新崛起成一座古老山脉阴影笼罩下又白又高的新城，都柏林也修葺一新，富饶、美丽、宽广，整个城市充满欢笑和温情，经由柔和温暖的雨水冲刷后在缕缕阳光下欢乐地闪耀着。"
"I see the great cities America has planned and made; the Golden City, with ever-ripening fruit along its broad warm ways, and the bell-glad City of a Thousand Spires.","我看到了美国设计制造的大城市。大城市戈登宽阔温馨的道路两旁硕果累累，千塔市充满了欢乐的钟声。"
"I see again as I have seen, the city of theaters and meeting-places, the City of the Sunlight Bight, and the new city that is still called Utah; and dominated by its observatory dome and the plain and dignified lines of the university facade upon the cliff, Martenabar the great white winter city of the upland snows.","我再次看到了它们，一如我曾见到的一样。剧院和会场之城，阳光港湾之城，还有仍被称为“犹他”的新城；还有高地雪地里的白色冬城马特那巴，四处可见圆顶天文台和悬崖边大学的建筑正面朴实而高贵的线条。"
"And the lesser places, too, the townships, the quiet resting-places, villages half forest with a brawl of streams down their streets, villages laced with avenues of cedar, villages of garden, of roses and wonderful flowers and the perpetual humming of bees.","小一点儿的地方也一样。比如镇区，静谧的度假区，掩映在森林中有叮咚流水穿过街道的村庄，雪松掩道的村庄，满是花园、群花争艳、还有不尽的蜜蜂嗡嗡声的村庄。"
"And through all the world go our children, our sons the old world would have made into servile clerks and shopmen, plough drudges and servants; our daughters who were erst anaemic drudges, prostitutes, sluts, anxiety-racked mothers or sere, repining failures; they go about this world glad and brave, learning, living, doing, happy and rejoicing, brave and free.","我们的儿女们生活在世界各地。在旧时代，男孩儿可能成为奴颜婢膝的职员、店员庄稼汉或仆人，女孩儿可能成为贫血的农妇、妓女、荡妇、心力交瘁的母亲或满腹牢骚的失败者，现在他们欢快勇敢地学习、生活、工作，幸福、愉快、勇敢、自由。"
"I think of them wandering in the clear quiet of the ruins of Rome, among the tombs of Egypt or the temples of Athens, of their coming to Mainington and its strange happiness, to Orba and the wonder of its white and slender tower....","我想起他们徜徉在寂静干净的罗马废墟上，穿梭在埃及的古墓或雅典的神庙间，想起他们来到梅宁顿的惊喜欢乐，来到奥巴看到白色细塔的惊异……"
"But who can tell of the fullness and pleasure of life, who can number all our new cities in the world?—cities made by the loving hands of men for living men, cities men weep to enter, so fair they are, so gracious and so kind....","但谁说得清生活的充实和欢乐呢，谁数得清世界上所有的新城呢？人们用爱的双手为健在的人们建造的城市，人们哭泣着进入的城市，他们是多么地纯朴、高尚和善良呀……"
"Some vision surely of these things must have been vouchsafed me as I sat there behind Melmount’s couch, but now my knowledge of accomplished things has mingled with and effaced my expectations.","我坐在梅尔蒙特的睡椅后，想着这些美好的画面。但我对已成就的事物的认识和我的期望混杂在一起，并且将它抹去了。"
"Something indeed I must have foreseen—or else why was my heart so glad?","我一定是预见了什么事情——否则我为何如此高兴呢？"

"Chapter the First","第一章"
"Love After the Change","巨变后的爱情"
"Section 1","第一节"
"So far I have said nothing of Nettie.","关于妮蒂，到目前为止我还什么都没说。"
"I have departed widely from my individual story.","我的叙述已远远偏离了我的个人经历。"
"I have tried to give you the effect of the change in relation to the general framework of human life, its effect of swift, magnificent dawn, of an overpowering letting in and inundation of light, and the spirit of living.","我试着向你讲述与人类生活总体框架相关的变化所产生的影响，这短暂而壮观的黎明带来的影响，这磅礴壮阔席卷而来的光芒的影响，以及生命的灵魂。　"
"In my memory all my life before the Change has the quality of a dark passage, with the dimmest side gleams of beauty that come and go.","在我的记忆里，巨变前我的生活就如同一条幽暗的通道，旁边的光线蒙眬而美丽，不断闪现。"
"The rest is dull pain and darkness.","余下的就只是枯燥、平淡和黑暗。"
"Then suddenly the walls, the bitter confines, are smitten and vanish, and I walk, blinded, perplexed, and yet rejoicing, in this sweet, beautiful world, in its fair incessant variety, its satisfaction, its opportunities, exultant in this glorious gift of life.","然后，这些令人不快的禁锢之墙在顷刻之间坍塌消失了，我走在这个美丽的世界里，茫然不知所措却又欣喜若狂。这个世界绚丽多姿、充满机遇、让人满足，生命赠予的这个富丽堂皇的礼物让我欢欣鼓舞。"
"Had I the power of music I would make a world-wide motif swell and amplify, gather to itself this theme and that, and rise at last to sheer ecstasy of triumph and rejoicing.","假如我有音乐天赋的话，我定会谱出一曲在全世界广为流传的乐曲，融合多个主题，最后在胜利和欣喜中心醉神迷。"
"It should be all sound, all pride, all the hope of outsetting in the morning brightness, all the glee of unexpected happenings, all the gladness of painful effort suddenly come to its reward; it should be like blossoms new opened and the happy play of children, like tearful, happy mothers holding their first-born, like cities building to the sound of music, and great ships, all hung with flags and wine bespattered, gliding down through cheering multitudes to their first meeting with the sea.","其曲调要优美，充满自豪，要像清晨初露的曙光那样充满希望，还要充满意外的惊喜以及艰辛的劳动忽然得到回报时的那种喜悦。要像刚刚盛开的花朵，像孩子们的欢乐嬉戏，像抱着第一个新生儿幸福得热泪盈眶的母亲，像随着音乐声修建而成的城市，像一艘艘巨轮，上面挂满彩旗，香槟四溅，滑过第一次奔向大海的欢呼的人群。"
"Through it all should march Hope, confident Hope, radiant and invincible, until at last it would be the triumph march of Hope the conqueror, coming with trumpetings and banners through the wide-flung gates of the world.","听了这首乐曲，所有的人都应该满怀希望地向前行进，这种希望让人充满信心，让人容光焕发、所向披靡，直到最后，随着世界大门之处的声声号角和飘扬的旗帜，在这希望的行进中取得胜利，成为征服者。"
"And then out of that luminous haze of gladness comes Nettie, transfigured.","这种欢乐让我有种轻飘飘的感觉，就在这时，妮蒂走了过来，身形有些走样。"
"So she came again to me—amazing, a thing incredibly forgotten.","她再次朝我走来，多么令人吃惊啊，后来我把这事给忘了，真是难以置信。"
"She comes back, and Verrall is in her company.","她回来了，身边是她的伴侣维罗尔。"
"She comes back into my memories now, just as she came back then, rather quaintly at first—at first not seen very clearly, a little distorted by intervening things, seen with a doubt, as I saw her through the slightly discolored panes of crinkled glass in the window of the Menton post-office and grocer’s shop.","现在她回到了我的记忆里，就像当初她回来一样。一开始我觉得甚是离奇有趣——起初没怎么看清楚，在一些物体的干扰下只觉得她身形有些扭曲。透过芒通邮局和杂货店那有些褪色的波纹状玻璃窗，我满心疑虑地看着她。"
"It was on the second day after the Change, and I had been sending telegrams for Melmount, who was making arrangements for his departure for Downing Street.","那是巨变之后第二天，我一直在给梅尔蒙特发电报，他准备离开，前往唐宁街。"
"I saw the two of them at first as small, flawed figures.","我起先只看到他俩小小的轮廓。"
"The glass made them seem curved, and it enhanced and altered their gestures and paces.","隔着玻璃，他们看起来有些弯曲，这改变了他们的姿态和步伐。"
"I felt it became me to say “Peace” to them, and I went out, to the jangling of the door-bell.","我觉得自己应该上前去向他们示好，于是门铃响起时，我便走了出去。"
"At the sight of me they stopped short, and Verrall cried with the note of one who has sought, “Here he is!”","一看见我，他俩立马止住了脚步，维罗尔像发现了新奇事物一样，大叫起来：“他在这里！”"
"And Nettie cried, “Willie!”","紧接着妮蒂也叫道：“威利！”"
"I went toward them, and all the perspectives of my reconstructed universe altered as I did so","我朝他们走去，这时我对于之前重构的世界的理解就随之改变了。"
"I seemed to see these two for the first time; how fine they were, how graceful and human.","我仿佛是第一次见这两人似的，他们看起来是那么友好、优雅而又和善。"
"It was as though I had never really looked at them before, and, indeed, always before I had beheld them through a mist of selfish passion.","我以前似乎从未真正仔细瞧过他们，的确，以前我总是带着强烈的个人感情色彩去注视他们。"
"They had shared the universal darkness and dwarfing of the former time; they shared the universal exaltation of the new.","他们同甘共苦，携手走过了过去那段黑暗的历程，然后享受着新时期这欢乐的生活。"
"Now suddenly Nettie, and the love of Nettie, a great passion for Nettie, lived again in me.","一瞬间，我心中对妮蒂的那份爱，那种强烈的感情又回来了。"
"This change which had enlarged men’s hearts had made no end to love.","这一变化使男人的心胸变得宽广，让爱得以延续。"
"Indeed, it had enormously enlarged and glorified love.","事实上，它从很大程度上放大了爱情，美化了爱情。"
"She stepped into the center of that dream of world reconstruction that filled my mind and took possession of it all.","她走进我重构的梦想世界里，占据了我的心，让我满脑子都是她。"
"A little wisp of hair had blown across her cheek, her lips fell apart in that sweet smile of hers; her eyes were full of wonder, of a welcoming scrutiny, of an infinitely courageous friendliness.","一缕发丝拂过她的脸颊，她笑容甜美，朱唇微启，双眼充满惊喜，以一种热情的审慎，和充满鼓励的友好目光打量着我。"
"I took her outstretched hand, and wonder overwhelmed me.","我抓住她伸出的手，开始浮想联翩。"
"“I wanted to kill you,” I said simply, trying to grasp that idea.","“我本想杀了你。”我简单地说了一句，试图一语中的。"
"It seemed now like stabbing the stars, or murdering the sunlight.","就像是要刺杀星辰或谋害阳光一样。"
"“Afterward we looked for you,” said Verrall; “and we could not find you....","“我们后来找过你，”维罗尔说，“可是我们没找到……"
"We heard another shot.”","我们又听到一声枪响。”"
"I turned my eyes to him, and Nettie’s hand fell from me.","我转眼去看他，妮蒂的手便从我手中抽了出去。"
"It was then I thought of how they had fallen together, and what it must have been to have awakened in that dawn with Nettie by one’s side.","就是在那时我想起他们是怎么走到了一起，想到那天黎明又是什么人在妮蒂身旁和她一起醒来。"
"I had a vision of them as I had glimpsed them last amidst the thickening vapors, close together, hand in hand.","透过浓雾，我最后瞥了一眼他们，只见他们手拉着手，亲密无间。"
"The green hawks of the Change spread their darkling wings above their last stumbling paces.","巨变就像绿色的雏鹰，张开它们那令人可怕的翅膀，盘旋在他们蹒跚的步履上方。"
"So they fell.","他们就这样相爱了。"
"And awoke—lovers together in a morning of Paradise.","醒来后，这对恋人沐浴在伊甸园的晨光中。"
"Who can tell how bright the sunshine was to them, how fair the flowers, how sweet the singing of the birds?...","谁能告诉我，对于他们而言，阳光有多么明媚，鲜花有多么美丽，鸟儿的歌唱有多么悦耳呢？……"
"This was the thought of my heart.","这就是我心底的想法。"

"Sheer blankness kept my thoughts silent for a little while; I said empty things.","有一小会儿，我脑子里一片空白，什么也没想，然后说了些无关紧要的话。"
"“I am very glad I did not kill you—that you are here, so fair and well....”","“我很高兴当时没有杀了你，所以现在你才能站在这里，这么幸福和健康……”"
"“I am going away back to Clayton on the day after to-morrow,” I said, breaking away to explanations.","“我打算后天回克莱顿去。”我赶紧换了话题，解释说，"
"“I have been writing shorthand here for Melmount, but that is almost over now....”","“我一直在这里给梅尔蒙特做速记，不过现在差不多快做完了……”"
"Neither of them said a word, and though all facts had suddenly ceased to matter anything, I went on informatively, “He is to be taken to Downing Street where there is a proper staff, so that there will be no need of me....","他们俩谁都没说话，尽管所有的事情突然都无关紧要了，可我还是像提供信息一样说道：“他要调到唐宁街去了，那里有一个合适的职位，所以这里就再也不需要我了……"
"Of course, you’re a little perplexed at my being with Melmount.","当然，你们对我怎么和梅尔蒙特在一起会有些迷惑。"
"You see I met him—by accident—directly I recovered.","你看，我偶然遇见了他，后来我就痊愈了。"
"I found him with a broken ankle—in that lane....","我在那条小巷里碰到他的，当时他一只脚踝骨折了。"
"I am to go now to the Four Towns to help prepare a report.","我这会儿马上要去四镇帮忙准备一份报告。"
"So that I am glad to see you both again”—I found a catch in my voice—“to say good-bye to you, and wish you well.”","很高兴再次见到你们。”我发现自己的声音有些哽咽，“很高兴和你们道别，祝你们一切顺利。”"
"This was after the quality of what had come into my mind when first I saw them through the grocer’s window, but it was not what I felt and thought as I said it.","我第一次穿过杂货店橱窗看见他们之后的情景，脑子里残存的记忆就这些了，可是当我说出来后，又不是我当时的感觉和想法了。"
"I went on saying it because otherwise there would have been a gap.","我继续说下去，否则，故事就会脱节了。"
"It had come to me that it was going to be hard to part from Nettie.","对我来说，和妮蒂分开非常困难。"
"My words sounded with an effect of unreality.","我的话听起来也有点儿不靠谱了。"
"I stopped, and we stood for a moment in silence looking at one another.","于是我打住，我们三个人就默不作声地站了一会儿，你看看我，我望望他。"
"It was I, I think, who was discovering most.","我觉得我是有最多发现的那个人。"
"I was realizing for the first time how little the Change had altered in my essential nature.","我第一次意识到巨变对我性格的影响是多么微小。"
"I had forgotten this business of love for a time in a world of wonder.","在这个奇妙的世界里，我曾有段时间忘记过这段爱情经历。"
"That was all.","仅此而已。"
"Nothing was lost from my nature, nothing had gone, only the power of thought and restraint had been wonderfully increased and new interests had been forced upon me.","我的性格里，没有失去什么，也没有改变什么，只是思维能力和克制能力大大提高了，而且我还培养了一些新的兴趣爱好。"
"The Green Vapors had passed, our minds were swept and garnished, but we were ourselves still, though living in a new and finer air.","绿霭已经消散，我们的旧思维也得以更新，即使我们呼吸着清新纯净的空气，我们还是我们自己。"
"My affinities were unchanged; Nettie’s personal charm for me was only quickened by the enhancement of my perceptions.","我对妮蒂的感情没有变，随着认识的加深，她对我来说更加有魅力了。"
"In her presence, meeting her eyes, instantly my desire, no longer frantic but sane, was awake again.","只要她一出现，而我又撞上她的眼神，我的爱欲就会立刻被唤起，这是一种理智而非疯狂的爱欲。"
"It was just like going to Checkshill in the old time, after writing about socialism....","这种感觉就像是在旧时写完社会主义的文章后去切克希利一样……"
"I relinquished her hand.","我放开了她的手。"
"It was absurd to part in these terms.","这种分别方式有些荒唐。"
"So we all felt it.","我们都察觉到了。"
"We hung awkwardly over our sense of that.","意识到那一点的时候，我们有些尴尬。"
"It was Verrall, I think, who shaped the thought for me, and said that to-morrow then we must meet and say good-bye, and so turned our encounter into a transitory making of arrangements.","我觉得这个主意就是维罗尔替我想到的，他说明天我们必须见面告别，于是我们的邂逅就变成了一次刻意的安排。"
"We settled we would come to the inn at Menton, all three of us, and take our midday meal together....","我们决定在芒通那家小店见面，三个人一起吃顿午饭……"

"I went on down the village street, not looking back, surprised at myself, and infinitely perplexed.","我沿着乡村的街道走去，没有回头，这一点连我自己都感到惊讶和困惑。"
"It was as if I had discovered something overlooked that disarranged all my plans, something entirely disconcerting.","我仿佛发现了一些曾经忽略了的东西，从而打乱了我所有的计划，让我仓皇失措。"
"For the first time I went back preoccupied and without eagerness to Melmount’s work.","我第一次心事重重地回到家，没有着急去梅尔蒙特那里工作。"

"Section 2","隐"
"The talk we three had together in the dawn of the new time is very strongly impressed upon my memory.","我们三人在新时代的曙光里的谈话深深地印在了我的脑海里。"
"There was something fresh and simple about it, something young and flushed and exalted.","谈话的内容新颖、简单，充满朝气、内容丰富、内涵深刻。"
"We took up, we handled with a certain naive timidity, the most difficult questions the Change had raised for men to solve.","我们着手解决巨变带给人们的那些最困的问题，虽然方式有点儿幼稚，还有点儿胆怯。"
"I recall we made little of them.","现在回想起来，我们也没解决什么问题。"
"All the old scheme of human life had dissolved and passed away, the narrow competitiveness, the greed and base aggression, the jealous aloofness of soul from soul.","人类生活的一切旧模式都已经消散，人与人之间的钩心斗角、贪婪和挑衅、嫉妒和冷漠也不复存在了。"
"Where had it left us?","巨变究竟给我们留下了什么呢？"
"That was what we and a thousand million others were discussing....","这就是我们以及其他数百万的人正在讨论的问题。"
"It chances that this last meeting with Nettie is inseparably associated—I don’t know why—with the landlady of the Menton inn.","凑巧的是，我和妮蒂的最后一次见面跟芒通小店的老板娘有紧密的关系，关于这一点我也不知道怎么解释。"
"The Menton inn was one of the rare pleasant corners of the old order; it was an inn of an unusual prosperity, much frequented by visitors from Shaphambury, and given to the serving of lunches and teas.","芒通小店是旧体制下少有的让人愉快的地方之一，提供午餐和茶点，生意异常兴隆，经常有来自香普汉贝里的客人光顾。"
"It had a broad mossy bowling-green, and round about it were creeper-covered arbors amidst beds of snap-dragon, and hollyhock, and blue delphinium, and many such tall familiar summer flowers.","它有一片宽敞的长满青苔的草坪，可以在上面滚木球，周围有几个被藤蔓覆盖的凉亭，而凉亭则在金鱼草、蜀葵、飞燕草和许多夏天常见的鲜花的簇拥之中。"
"These stood out against a background of laurels and holly, and above these again rose the gables of the inn and its signpost—a white horsed George slaying the dragon—against copper beeches under the sky.","这些后面是一些月桂树和冬青属植物，往上可以看见小店突起的三角墙，还有它那触碰到山毛榉的路标，上面是乔治身骑白马，勇杀巨龙。"
"While I waited for Nettie and Verrall in this agreeable trysting place, I talked to the landlady—a broad-shouldered, smiling, freckled woman—about the morning of the Change.","当我在这个宜人的约会地点等候妮蒂和维罗尔的时候，我和老板娘谈论起巨变之后的那个清晨。这位老板娘肩膀较宽，面带微笑，脸上长满了雀斑。"
"That motherly, abundant, red-haired figure of health was buoyantly sure that everything in the world was now to be changed for the better.","她和蔼可亲、精力充沛、身体健康，还披着一头红发，非常乐观。她相信现在世界万物都在朝更好的方向发展。"
"That confidence, and something in her voice, made me love her as I talked to her.","和她谈话时，她的信心以及她声音里的某种东西让我很喜欢她。"
"“Now we’re awake,” she said, “all sorts of things will be put right that hadn’t any sense in them.","“现在我们清醒了，”她说，“一切都将步入正轨，这一点毫无疑问。"
"Why?","为什么？"
"Oh!","噢！"
"I’m sure of it.”","我很肯定。”"
"Her kind blue eyes met mine in an infinitude of friendliness.","她用她那蓝色的双眼看着我，和蔼又友善。"
"Her lips in her pauses shaped in a pretty faint smile.","不说话时，她的双唇形成一个迷人的微笑。"
"Old tradition was strong in us; all English inns in those days charged the unexpected, and I asked what our lunch was to cost.","我们一直沿袭着旧传统，当时英国所有的小酒馆只对不速之客收费，于是我问她我们的午餐要花多少钱。"
"“Pay or not,” she said, “and what you like.","“付不付都可以，”她说，“随便你。"
"It’s holiday these days.","这些天是节假日。"
"I suppose we’ll still have paying and charging, however we manage it, but it won’t be the worry it has been—that I feel sure.","我想我们仍然会使用现金支付和赊账两种方式，不过我们会有办法应付的，如今不需要太担心，这点我敢肯定。"
"It’s the part I never had no fancy for.","我从来都不喜欢收钱这档事。"
"Many a time I peeped through the bushes worrying to think what was just and right to me and mine, and what would send ’em away satisfied.","我曾多次偷偷隔着灌木丛观看，边看边想对于我和我的小酒馆来说怎样才算公平正确，怎样才能让顾客满意而归。"
"It isn’t the money I care for.","钱不是我所在乎的。"
"There’ll be mighty changes, be sure of that; but here I’ll stay, and make people happy—them that go by on the roads.","世界将会发生巨大的变化，你要相信这一点。不过我要留下来做一些事情，让人们，也就是那些从这条路上经过的人们开心。"
"It’s a pleasant place here when people are merry; it’s only when they’re jealous, or mean, or tired, or eat up beyond any stomach’s digesting, or when they got the drink in ’em that Satan comes into this garden.","只要人们快乐，这就是一个舒适的地方。只有当人们变得嫉妒、吝啬、厌倦、贪婪，或者喝得烂醉如泥的时候，魔鬼撒旦才会来到这片幸福乐园。"
"Many’s the happy face I’ve seen here, and many that come again like friends, but nothing to equal what’s going to be, now things are being set right.”","我看见过许多人脸上洋溢着幸福，他们就像老朋友一样会再次光临，但是一切都在改变，现在事情正在恢复正常。”"
"She smiled, that bounteous woman, with the joy of life and hope.","她笑了笑，这个慷慨大方的女人，觉得生活充满了喜悦和希望。"
"“You shall have an omelet,” she said, “you and your friends; such an omelet—like they’ll have ’em in heaven!","“你们可以来份儿煎蛋卷，”她说，“也就是你和你的朋友们，这样的煎蛋卷，他们只能在天上才能吃到！"
"I feel there’s cooking in me these days like I’ve never cooked before.","我觉得这些天我突然有了烹饪天赋，就好像我以前从来都没做过菜一样。"
"I’m rejoiced to have it to do....”","我很高兴做这些事情……”"
"It was just then that Nettie and Verrall appeared under a rustic archway of crimson roses that led out from the inn.","就在这时，妮蒂和维罗尔出现在做工粗糙的拱门下，上面的红蔷薇是从小酒馆里伸出来的。"
"Nettie wore white and a sun-hat, and Verrall was a figure of gray.","妮蒂穿着一件白色的衣服，戴着一顶遮阳帽，维罗尔则是一身灰衣。"
"“Here are my friends,” I said; but for all the magic of the Change, something passed athwart the sunlight in my soul like the passing of the shadow of a cloud.","“我朋友来了，”我说。可是由于巨变的魔力，有些东西遮挡了我心里的阳光，就像乌云穿过一样。"
"“A pretty couple,” said the landlady, as they crossed the velvet green toward us....","“很般配的一对，”老板娘在他们踏着柔软的草坪朝我们走来时这样说道。"
"They were indeed a pretty couple, but that did not greatly gladden me.","他们的确是般配，不过这并没有让我很高兴。"
"No—I winced a little at that.","没错，因为我的心揪了一下。"
"Section 3","第三节"
"This old newspaper, this first reissue of the New Paper, dessicated last relic of a vanished age, is like the little piece of identification the superstitious of the old days—those queer religionists who brought a certain black-clad Mrs. Piper to the help of Christ—used to put into the hand of a clairvoyant.","这份旧报纸，是《新报》重印的第一期，皱巴巴的，成了一个已经消逝的时代的最后一份纪念物，好像是旧时代迷信的一小片见证。那些古怪的基督徒们将身穿黑衣的派珀夫人带到救世主基督面前，交给这位极具洞察力的人手里。"
"At the crisp touch of it I look across a gulf of fifty years and see again the three of us sitting about that table in the arbor, and I smell again the smell of the sweet-briar that filled the air about us, and hear in our long pauses the abundant murmuring of bees among the heliotrope of the borders.","触碰到这份报纸，我仿佛一下回到了50年前，又看到我们三人坐在凉亭下的那张桌子旁，又嗅到弥漫在空气中的野蔷薇的香气，在我们长时间的沉默中听到蜜蜂在花坛植物间的嗡嗡声。"
"It is the dawn of the new time, but we bear, all three of us, the marks and liveries of the old.","现在是新时代的开端，而我们三人却带着旧时代的痕迹，穿着旧时代的制服。"
"I see myself, a dark, ill-dressed youth, with the bruise Lord Redcar gave me still blue and yellow beneath my jaw; and young Verrall sits cornerwise to me, better grown, better dressed, fair and quiet, two years my senior indeed, but looking no older than I because of his light complexion; and opposite me is Nettie, with dark eyes upon my face, graver and more beautiful than I had ever seen her in the former time.","我看见我自己还是一个皮肤黝黑、衣衫褴褛的少年，下巴上还带着被雷德卡勋爵打得青一块紫一块的伤痕。年轻的维罗尔坐在我斜对面，他长得比我好看，穿得也比我好，文质彬彬的样子，比我大两岁，但是由于皮肤白皙，看起来并不比我大。我对面是妮蒂，她用乌黑的眼睛望着我的脸，比以往任何时候都要端庄，都要漂亮。"
"Her dress is still that white one she had worn when I came upon her in the park, and still about her dainty neck she wears her string of pearls and that little coin of gold.","她仍然穿着我在公园里碰见她时穿的那一身白色衣服，秀美的脖子上依然戴着那串珍珠项链和那一枚小小的金币。"
"She is so much the same, she is so changed; a girl then and now a woman—and all my agony and all the marvel of the Change between!","她和以前没什么两样，可是变化却又如此之大，曾经的女孩儿变成了如今的少妇，两者之间的变化让我既苦恼又惊叹。"
"Over the end of the green table about which we sit, a spotless cloth is spread, it bears a pleasant lunch spread out with a simple equipage.","我们坐在一张绿色的桌子边，桌子末端铺着一张干净的桌布，上面摆了一套简单的餐具，盛着讨人喜欢的午餐。"
"Behind me is the liberal sunshine of the green and various garden.","在我身后，明媚的阳光洒满草地和花园。"
"I see it all.","这些我都看见了。"
"Again I sit there, eating awkwardly, this paper lies upon the table and Verrall talks of the Change.","现在我又坐在那里吃着饭，动作有些笨拙，报纸就摊在桌上，维罗尔谈论着巨变。"
"“You can’t imagine,” he says in his sure, fine accents, “how much the Change has destroyed of me.","“你想象不到，”他说话时语气肯定，口音标准，“巨变对我的打击有多大。"
"I still don’t feel awake.","我现在都还没觉得清醒。"
"Men of my sort are so tremendously MADE; I never suspected it before.”","我这种人生来境遇优越，以前我从未怀疑过这一点。”"
"He leans over the table toward me with an evident desire to make himself perfectly understood.","他斜倚在桌子上凑近我，明显是希望我能完全明白他的意思。"
"“I find myself like some creature that is taken out of its shell—soft and new.","“我觉得自己就像某种被剥了壳的生物，柔软而新鲜。"
"I was trained to dress in a certain way, to behave in a certain way, to think in a certain way; I see now it’s all wrong and narrow—most of it anyhow—a system of class shibboleths.","我从小受到的教育都是要这样穿衣，要那样做事，要这样思考。现在我明白了那都是错误和狭隘的，不管怎样大部分如此，就是一套经典的陈腔滥调。"
"We were decent to each other in order to be a gang to the rest of the world.","我们的言谈举止在彼此看来要是得体的，就是为了和世界上其余的人打成一片。"
"Gentlemen indeed!","的确很绅士！"
"But it’s perplexing—”","但是这真让人迷惑——”"
"I can hear his voice saying that now, and see the lift of his eyebrows and his pleasant smile.","现在我都还能听见他说话的声音，看见他扬起的眉毛和愉快的笑容。"
"He paused.","他停了下来。"
"He had wanted to say that, but it was not the thing we had to say.","本来他还想说的，不过那并不是我们必须谈论的话题。"
"I leant forward a little and took hold of my glass very tightly.","我往前凑近了一点，紧紧地抓着我的杯子。"
"“You two,” I said, “will marry?”","“你们俩，”我说，“要结婚了吗？”"
"They looked at one another.","他们互相看了看。"

"“I did not mean to marry when I came away,” she said.","“我离开的时候并没打算要结婚。”她说道。"
"“I know,” I answered.","“我知道，”我说。"
"I looked up with a sense of effort and met Verrall’s eyes.","我试图往上看，却撞见维罗尔的目光。"
"He answered me.","他回答了我。"
"“I think we two have joined our lives....","“我认为我们的生命已经连在一起了……"
"But the thing that took us was a sort of madness.”","但是支配我们行为的却是一种疯狂行为。”"
"I nodded.","我点了点头。"
"“All passion,” I said, “is madness.”","“爱情，”我说，“本就是疯狂的。”"
"Then I fell into a doubting of those words.","说完我就开始怀疑这些话。"
"“Why did we do these things?”","“为什么我们要做这些事情呢？”"
"he said, turning to her suddenly.","他这样说着，突然转向她。"
"Her hands were clasped under her chin, her eyes downcast.","她双手交叉托着下巴，眼睛朝下看着。"
"“We HAD to,” she said, with her old trick of inadequate expression.","“我们不得不做，”她的话只说了一半，这是她惯用的伎俩。"
"Then she seemed to open out suddenly.","然后她似乎是突然打开了话匣子。"
"“Willie,” she cried with a sudden directness, with her eyes appealing to me, “I didn’t mean to treat you badly—indeed I didn’t.","“威利，”她突然单刀直入地叫了一声，双眼热切地望着我，“我不是有意对你那么不好的——真的不是有意。"
"I kept thinking of you—and of father and mother, all the time.","我常常想起你，还有我父母，一直都在想。"
"Only it didn’t seem to move me.","只是它似乎并没有动摇我。"
"It didn’t move me not one bit from the way I had chosen.”","它没有一丁点儿动摇我走上自己早已选好的路。”"
"“Chosen!”","“早已选好的！”"
"I said.","我说道。"
"“Something seemed to have hold of me,” she admitted.","“似乎有什么东西抓住了我，”她承认，"

"Everything.","接着所有的声音都这么说。"
"It was a raging desire—for her.","那是对她的一种疯狂的渴望。"

"Everything contributed to that—or counted for nothing.","一切都推动着事情发展，不然什么也解释不了。"
"You—”","你——”"
"“Go on,” said I.","“接着说，”我说。"
"“When I knew of you—”","“当我认识你时——”"
"I looked at Nettie.","我看着妮蒂。"
"“You never told him about me?”","“你从未对他说过我吗？”"
"I said, feeling, as it were, a sting out of the old time.","我问道，感觉就像旧时代的一种讽刺。"
"Verrall answered for her.","维罗尔替她回答说："

"I knew it was you.”","我知道那就是你。”"
"“You triumphed over me?...","“你战胜我了？"
"If I could I would have triumphed over you,” I said.","如果可以的话，我一定会赢过你。”我说，"
"“But go on!”","“再继续说！”"
"“Everything conspired to make it the finest thing in life.","“所有的一切合力让它成为了生命里最美好的事情。"
"It had an air of generous recklessness.","起初我并不在意，行事草率。"
"It meant mischief, it might mean failure in that life of politics and affairs, for which I was trained, which it was my honor to follow.","那就意味着祸根，有可能意味着政治生活和一般事务中的失败，这一点曾有人教过我，而遵循这一点则是我的荣幸。"
"That made it all the finer.","那让事情变得更加美好。"

"That made it all the finer.","那让事情变得更加美好。"
"No sane or decent man would have approved of what we did.","没有哪个精神正常或行为得体的人会赞同我们所做的。"

"She smiled—a flash of brightness at Verrall.","她笑了笑，看着维罗尔的时候，眼里闪出一丝光亮，"
"“I kept thinking of being like a lady and sitting in an hotel—with men like butlers waiting.","“我不断地想象自己成了太太，坐在酒店里，身边的男人就像仆人一样候着。"
"It’s the dreadful truth, Willie.","这就是那个可怕的事实，威利。"
"Things as mean as that!","所有的事情都像那样低劣！"
"Things meaner than that!”","再没有比那更低劣的事情了！”"
"I can see her now pleading with me, speaking with a frankness as bright and amazing as the dawn of the first great morning.","我可以看出她在恳求我，说话坦诚直率，就像巨变后第一天清晨的曙光那样明亮、令人惊奇。"

"“Yes,” I said to Verrall, making these discoveries quietly, “yes, Verrall, you have a good voice.","“是呀，”我对维罗尔说，尝试让这些发现不那么张扬，“不错，维罗尔，你有一副好的嗓音。"
"Queer I never thought of that before!”","奇怪，我以前竟然从未想过这一点！”"
"We sat silently for a time before our vivisected passions.","面对这样的情绪激昂，我们静静地坐了一会儿。"
"“Gods!”","“老天呀！”"
"I cried, “and there was our poor little top-hamper of intelligence on all these waves of instinct and wordless desire, these foaming things of touch and sight and feeling, like—like a coop of hens washed overboard and clucking amidst the seas.”","我叫道，“在本能和无言的欲望之上，我们的智力遭遇了一些小小的障碍，这些泡沫状的东西，摸得着、看得见、感觉得到，就像一笼母鸡被冲到了水中，在大海里咯咯乱叫。”"

"And Willie.","还有威利。"
"And because I never really believed in the mold at all—even if I thought I did.","因为我根本就没相信过模式这东西，即使我曾以为我相信。"
"It’s stupid to send Willie off—shamed, cast out, never to see him again—when I like him as much as I do.","当我很喜欢威利的时候，我却让他离开，这是很愚蠢的，我为自己把他赶走，不想再见到他感到羞愧。"
"It is cruel, it is wicked and ugly, to prance over him as if he was a defeated enemy, and pretend I’m going to be happy just the same.","仿佛他是个战败的敌人一样，从他身上踏过，我还要假装和从前一样开心，这是很残忍的，而且邪恶和丑陋。"

"And men, as you say, are more obstinate than women.","正如你所言，男人要比女人顽固。"
"The comet hasn’t altered that; it’s only made it clearer.","彗星没有改变这一点，只是让它更加明显了。"
"We have come into being through a tumult of blind forces....","在一阵盲目暴力的骚乱之后，我们安定下来……"
"I come back to what I said just now; we have found our poor reasonable minds, our wills to live well, ourselves, adrift on a wash of instincts, passions, instinctive prejudices, half animal stupidities....","我回到刚刚说的点上，我们发现自己推理能力很弱，有想过好日子的意愿，我们在本能和激情的冲击中飘荡，本性上有些偏激，又有些愚昧……"
"Here we are like people clinging to something—like people awakening—upon a raft.”","我们就像附着在某个物体的人，刚刚苏醒，站在竹筏之上。”"

"“Part,” I said.","“分别，”我说，"
"“You see, Nettie, these bodies of ours are not the bodies of angels.","“你知道，妮蒂，我们的躯体不是天使之躯。"
"They are the same bodies—I have read somewhere that in our bodies you can find evidence of the lowliest ancestry; that about our inward ears—I think it is—and about our teeth, there remains still something of the fish, that there are bones that recall little—what is it?—marsupial forebears—and a hundred traces of the ape.","他们拥有相同的躯体——我在哪里看到过，说在我们体内可以找到最早祖先的痕迹，有些与我们的耳朵有关，我是这样觉得的，还有就是我们的牙齿，还保留着鱼的某个器官的特征。我们的骨头能让人想起什么呢？那就是小小的有袋动物祖先以及类人猿的痕迹。"
"Even your beautiful body, Nettie, carries this taint.","甚至是你那曼妙的身躯，妮蒂，也有这种污点。"
"No!","嘘！"
"Hear me out.”","听我说完。”"
"I leant forward earnestly.","我真诚地往前凑了凑，"
"“Our emotions, our passions, our desires, the substance of them, like the substance of our bodies, is an animal, a competing thing, as well as a desiring thing.","“我们的情感，我们的恋情，我们的欲望，这些东西的本质跟我们身体的本质没什么两样，都是动物，会竞争、有欲望。"
"You speak to us now a mind to minds—one can do that when one has had exercise and when one has eaten, when one is not doing anything—but when one turns to live, one turns again to matter.”","现在你对我们讲话，是一人对众人，一个人经过训练，吃饱了饭，没什么事儿干的时候就可以这样做。但是一个人要生存，他就需要物质。”"
"“Yes,” said Nettie, slowly following me, “but you control it.”","“不错，”妮蒂接过我的话慢悠悠地说，“可你得控制它。”"
"“Only through a measure of obedience.","“只能通过服从的方式。"
"There is no magic in the business—to conquer matter, we must divide the enemy, and take matter as an ally.","在这件事上没什么魔法可言，要战胜物质，我们必须瓦解敌人，将物质看做同盟。"
"Nowadays it is indeed true, by faith a man can remove mountains; he can say to a mountain, Be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea; but he does it because he helps and trusts his brother men, because he has the wit and patience and courage to win over to his side iron, steel, obedience, dynamite, cranes, trucks, the money of other people....","现今事实如此，一个人靠信念可以移山，可以同大山对话，告诉它要么被移走，要么拿去填海。他这样做是因为他和他的同伴弟兄互相帮助、互相信赖，因为他有智慧、有耐心、有勇气去战胜钢铁、顺从、炸药、起重机、载重汽车以及财力之类的东西……"
"To conquer my desire for you, I must not perpetually thwart it by your presence; I must go away so that I may not see you, I must take up other interests, thrust myself into struggles and discussions—”","为了克服我对你的渴望，我必须永远都不让你出现在我面前，我必须离开，不再见你，我必须另外培养一些兴趣爱好，全身心投入到事业中去——”"
"“And forget?”","“然后忘记？”"
"said Nettie.","妮蒂问。"
"“Not forget,” I said; “but anyhow—cease to brood upon you.”","“不是忘记，”我说，“但是不管怎样——停止去想你。”"
"She hung on that for some moments.","她揣摩了一会儿。"
"“No,” she said, demolished her last pattern and looked up at Verrall as he stirred.","“不可以，”她说着，推掉了最后摆好的图案，抬起头来看着维罗尔，那时他正心神不宁。"
"Verrall leant forward on the table, elbows upon it, and the fingers of his two hands intertwined.","维罗尔身子前倾靠着桌子，双肘搁在桌上，十指缠绕。"
"“You know,” he said, “I haven’t thought much of these things.","“你知道的，”他说，“我没怎么想过这些事情。"
"At school and the university, one doesn’t....","在中学和大学里，人们不会……"
"It was part of the system to prevent it.","规章制度会阻止这种事情的发生。"
"They’ll alter all that, no doubt.","他们会改变这一切，毫无疑问。"
"We seem”—he thought—“to be skating about over questions that one came to at last in Greek—with variorum readings—in Plato, but which it never occurred to any one to translate out of a dead language into living realities....”","我们似乎”——他想了一下——“只是略微触及了一些问题，这些问题是人们在希腊文或柏拉图的集注本里会碰到的，不过这对于那些把一种已经废弃的语言翻译成鲜活语言的人来说是不会发生的……”"
"He halted and answered some unspoken question from his own mind with, “No. I think with Leadford, Nettie, that, as he put it, it is in the nature of things for men to be exclusive....","他停了下来，从自己的思维角度谈了一些没有说出口的问题，“不，妮蒂，我同利德福特的想法一样，如他所言，男人是例外，这是由事物的本质决定的……"
"Minds are free things and go about the world, but only one man can possess a woman.","人的思维是自由的，想到哪里就到哪里，可是一个男人只能拥有一个女人。"
"You must dismiss rivals.","你必须打败你的对手。"
"We are made for the struggle for existence—we ARE the struggle for existence; the things that live are the struggle for existence incarnate—and that works out that the men struggle for their mates; for each woman one prevails.","我们生来就要为生存而争斗，我们奋斗就是为了生存。现存的所有事物都是经过争斗后留下的，我们可以得出这样的结论，男人都是为了他们的伴侣而争斗，因为每个女人都只会被一个男人占有。"
"The others go away.”","其余的人得走开。”"
"“Like animals,” said Nettie.","“就像动物，”妮蒂说。"
"“Yes....”","“是的……”"
"“There are many things in life,” I said, “but that is the rough universal truth.”","“生活里有许多事情，”我说，“不过这个总体上算是一个普遍的真理。”"
"“But,” said Nettie, “you don’t struggle.","“可是，”妮蒂说，“你们不用争斗了。"
"That has been altered because men have minds.”","一切都改变了，因为人类有了思维。”"
"“You choose,” I said.","“你来做选择，”我说。"
"“If I don’t choose to choose?”","“如果我选择不做选择呢？”"
"“You have chosen.”","“你已经选好了。”"
"She gave a little impatient “Oh!","她有点儿不耐烦了：“噢！"

"Is this great age of Reason and Light that has come to alter nothing of that?","这个理性光明的伟大时代难道对此没有做出一点改变吗？"
"And men too!","人也没变！"
"I think it is all—stupid.","我觉得这一切太愚昧了。"
"I do not believe this is the right solution of the thing, or anything but the bad habits of the time that was... Instinct!","我不相信这是正确的解决问题的方法，它就是时代的坏习俗……还说是本能！"
"You don’t let your instincts rule you in a lot of other things.","你不会让你的本能在其他事情上控制你。"
"Here am I between you.","现在我横在你们两个中间。"
"Here is Edward.","爱德华在这边。"
"I—love him because he is gay and pleasant, and because—because I LIKE him!","我——爱他，因为他让我快乐，让我开心，因为——因为我就是喜欢他！"
"Here is Willie—a part of me—my first secret, my oldest friend!","威利在这边，他是我的一部分，是我的初恋，是我的老朋友！"
"Why must I not have both?","为什么我不能同时拥有你们俩？"
"Am I not a mind that you must think of me as nothing but a woman?","我就搞不懂，怎么你们就只把我当作女人看待呢？"
"imagine me always as a thing to struggle for?”","总是把我当成一件要为之争斗的东西吗？”"
"She paused; then she made her distressful proposition to me.","她停了下来，然后提出一个让我苦恼的建议。"
"“Let us three keep together,” she said.","“就让我们三人呆在一起吧，”她说，"
"“Let us not part.","“让我们不要分开。"
"To part is hate, Willie.","分离就是仇恨，威利。"
"Why should we not anyhow keep friends?","为什么我们就不能想办法保持朋友关系？"
"Meet and talk?”","见见面，聊聊天呢？”"
"“Talk?”","“聊天？”"
"I said.","我说，"
"“About this sort of thing?”","“聊这种事情吗？”"
"I looked across at Verrall and met his eyes, and we studied one another.","我的视线穿过妮蒂，与维罗尔的目光相遇，彼此揣度着对方。"
"It was the clean, straight scrutiny of honest antagonism.","我明显能察觉出对方毫不掩饰的敌意。"

"From Nettie my love—asks all.","从妮蒂身上，我想得到全部的爱。"
"A man’s love is not devotion—it is a demand, a challenge.","男人的爱不是奉献，而是一种需求，一种挑战。"
"And besides”—and here I forced my theme—“I have given myself now to a new mistress—and it is I, Nettie, who am unfaithful.","除此之外”——说到这里我强调了一下——“我已另结新欢，所以，妮蒂，是我不忠诚。"
"Behind you and above you rises the coming City of the World, and I am in that building.","在你身后，在你上方，世界之都正平地而起，而我就在那座建筑物里。"
"Dear heart!","宝贝儿！"
"you are only happiness—and that—Indeed that calls!","事实上这一切都是为了你幸福！"
"If it is only that my life blood shall christen the foundation stones—I could almost hope that should be my part, Nettie—I will join myself in that.”","只要我的生命之血能洗礼你那幸福的奠基石，我愿用我的一切来换取。妮蒂，我希望我能扮演这个角色。”"

"For a moment we looked at one another, mute, as though deep down in the unfathomable darkness below the surface and present reality of things dumb meanings strove to be.","我们相互看了一会儿，沉默不语，好像这件事情表面之下是深不见底的黑暗，其意义捉摸不透。"
"She made to speak and desisted.","她想说点什么。但还是打住了。"
"“But MUST I go?”","“我必须离开吗？”"
"she said at last, with quivering lips, and the tears in her eyes were stars.","她最终开口问道，双唇哆嗦，眼里闪着泪光。"
"Then she began, “Willie—”","然后她开始大喊，“威利——”"
"“Go!”","“走啊！”"
"I interrupted her....","我打断了她的声音……"
"“Yes.”","“没错。”"
"Then again we were still.","我们又一动不动。"
"She stood there, a tearful figure of pity, longing for me, pitying me.","她站在那里，哭成了泪人，急切地望着我，让人煞是爱怜。"
"Something of that wider love, that will carry our descendants at last out of all the limits, the hard, clear obligations of our personal life, moved us, like the first breath of a coming wind out of heaven that stirs and passes away.","这种深深的爱意将会使我们的子孙后代打破所有的限制，只是我们现在彼此的义务和职责，就像是从天堂里刮来的翻卷的狂风一样，让我们必须分开。"
"I had an impulse to take her hand and kiss it, and then a trembling came to me, and I knew that if I touched her, my strength would all pass from me....","我有一种冲动，想上前抓起她的手亲吻，只是我随之打了个冷战，我知道如果我碰了她，我所有的防线就会崩溃……"
"And so, standing at a distance one from the other, we parted, and Nettie went, reluctant and looking back, with the man she had chosen, to the lot she had chosen, out of my life—like the sunlight out of my life....","所以，我们俩就远远地站着，然后就分开了。妮蒂离开了，和她选择的男人一块儿走向她所选择的命运。她极不情愿，频频回过头张望。她走出了我的生命，就像阳光走出了我的生活……"
"Then, you know, I suppose I folded up this newspaper and put it in my pocket.","接下来，你知道，我想我是把报纸折好，塞进口袋里了。"
"But my memory of that meeting ends with the face of Nettie turning to go.","但我对于那次见面的记忆随着妮蒂转身离开的一幕一起结束了。"
"Section 6","第六节"
"I remember all that very distinctly to this day.","至今我对这一切都还记得很清楚。"
"I could almost vouch for the words I have put into our several mouths.","我几乎可以保证能将我们三个人说的话再说一遍。"
"Then comes a blank.","后面的记忆就是一片空白了。"
"I have a dim memory of being back in the house near the Links and the bustle of Melmount’s departure, of finding Parker’s energy distasteful, and of going away down the road with a strong desire to say good-bye to Melmount alone.","我依稀记得回到了林克家附近的屋子，记得梅尔蒙特离开时非常热闹，记得自己讨厌帕克精力旺盛的样子，还记得我沿着马路走下去，怀着强烈的愿望要单独和梅尔蒙特道别。"
"Perhaps I was already doubting my decision to part for ever from Nettie, for I think I had it in mind to tell him all that had been said and done....","或许我已经开始怀疑我做出的和妮蒂永远分离的决定了，因为我记得我把之前说的话、做的事都告诉了他……"
"I don’t think I had a word with him or anything but a hurried hand clasp.","可我又认为我没有和他说什么，就是匆匆地握了一下手而已。"
"I am not sure.","我不确定。"
"It has gone out of my mind.","我已经记不清了。"
"But I have a very clear and certain memory of my phase of bleak desolation as I watched his car recede and climb and vanish over Mapleborough Hill, and that I got there my first full and definite intimation that, after all, this great Change and my new wide aims in life, were not to mean indiscriminate happiness for me.","但我却清楚地记得，当我看见他的车渐渐远去，爬上马坡博鲁山然后消失时，我觉得好凄凉，也是在那里我第一次获得一个肯定的指示，毕竟这场伟大的巨变和我新的生活目标对我意味着不同的幸福。"
"I had a sense of protest, as against extreme unfairness, as I saw him go.","当我看着他走远时，仿佛像遭受了不公平的待遇一样，想要抗议。"
"“It is too soon,” I said to myself, “to leave me alone.”","“现在就剩下我一个人了，这也太快了。”我自言自语道。"
"I felt I had sacrificed too much, that after I had said good-bye to the hot immediate life of passion, to Nettie and desire, to physical and personal rivalry, to all that was most intensely myself, it was wrong to leave me alone and sore hearted, to go on at once with these steely cold duties of the wider life.","我觉得我牺牲得太多了，在我告别了热烈而短暂的感情，告别了妮蒂和欲望，告别了物质和个人竞争，告别了最热切的自我之后，他们却丢下我孤身一人和一颗伤痛的心，立刻担起新生活那些冰冷的职责，这是不应该的。"
"I felt new born, and naked, and at a loss.","我觉得自己像新生的婴儿，一丝不挂，不知所措。"
"“Work!”","“干活儿！”"
"I said with an effort at the heroic, and turned about with a sigh, and I was glad that the way I had to go would at least take me to my mother....","我用尽全力大声叫道，然后转过身来叹了口气，不过我很高兴我必须走过的路能将我带回到母亲身边……"
"But, curiously enough, I remember myself as being fairly cheerful in the town of Birmingham that night, I recall an active and interested mood.","但是，让人很好奇的是，我记得那晚在伯明翰小镇上，我的心情特别舒畅，情绪高昂，非常活跃。"
"I spent the night in Birmingham because the train service on was disarranged, and I could not get on.","我在伯明翰过了一夜是因为火车改点，我没法上车。"
"I went to listen to a band that was playing its brassy old-world music in the public park, and I fell into conversation with a man who said he had been a reporter upon one of their minor local papers.","我到公共公园去听了一支乐队演奏的古老乐曲，和一个陌生人攀谈起来，他说他曾是他们当地一家小报社的记者。"
"He was full and keen upon all the plans of reconstruction that were now shaping over the lives of humanity, and I know that something of that noble dream came back to me with his words and phrases.","他对那些着眼于重整人类生活的计划相当热心，我知道随着他的话语，我找回了内心那崇高的梦想。"
"We walked up to a place called Bourneville by moonlight, and talked of the new social groupings that must replace the old isolated homes, and how the people would be housed.","我们踏着月光来到一个叫伯恩维勒的地方，谈论着新的社会群集必将取代旧有的孤立的住宅，我们还说到如何安置人民。"
"This Bourneville was germane to that matter.","在伯恩维勒就遇到了这样的事情。"
"It had been an attempt on the part of a private firm of manufacturers to improve the housing of their workers.","有一家私营制造公司曾试图改善工人的住宿条件。"
"To our ideas to-day it would seem the feeblest of benevolent efforts, but at the time it was extraordinary and famous, and people came long journeys to see its trim cottages with baths sunk under the kitchen floors (of all conceivable places), and other brilliant inventions.","在我们今天看来，那种慈善举动似乎是最徒劳无益的，不过在当时却非同凡响，相当有名。人们长途跋涉就是为了来看看这些修葺整齐、浴室建在厨房的地板下面（难以想象的地方）的小屋以及其他一些卓越的发明创造。"
"No one seemed to see the danger to liberty in that aggressive age, that might arise through making workpeople tenants and debtors of their employer, though an Act called the Truck Act had long ago intervened to prevent minor developments in the same direction....","似乎没有人看到在那个积极进取的年代自由所面临的威胁，虽然《工资实物支付禁止法》早已颁布，用来阻止这方面细微的进展，可是工人一旦成为雇主的佃户或是债务人，这种威胁就会出现……"
"But I and my chance acquaintance seemed that night always to have been aware of that possibility, and we had no doubt in our minds of the public nature of the housing duty.","但是我和我偶然相遇的朋友似乎那晚就意识到了这种可能性，我们毫不怀疑住房税的公众本质。"
"Our interest lay rather in the possibility of common nurseries and kitchens and public rooms that should economize toil and give people space and freedom.","我们的兴趣所在却是普通的儿童室、厨房和公用房间有多大可能可以使减少人们的劳累，给他们提供空间和自由。"
"It was very interesting, but still a little cheerless, and when I lay in bed that night I thought of Nettie and the queer modifications of preference she had made, and among other things and in a way, I prayed.","这些事情很有趣，不过我依然有一点阴郁。那晚我躺在床上，想起了妮蒂，觉得她做了决定却又改变有些奇怪，我还想起了其他的一些事情。从某种程度上说，我还做了祈祷。"
"I prayed that night, let me confess it, to an image I had set up in my heart, an image that still serves with me as a symbol for things inconceivable, to a Master Artificer, the unseen captain of all who go about the building of the world, the making of mankind.","我承认那天晚上我向我心中的形象祷告，这个形象仍然象征一切不可思议的事物，我还向从未见过的造物主祷告，他主宰着世间的一切，造就了人类。"
"But before and after I prayed I imagined I was talking and reasoning and meeting again with Nettie....","不过在祈祷前后，我想象自己再次见到了妮蒂，和她说话和论理……"
"She never came into the temple of that worshiping with me.","可她却从来没和我来过这家教堂做礼拜。"

"Chapter the Second","第二章"
"My Mother’s Last Days","母亲弥留之际"
"Section 1","第一节"
"NEXT day I came home to Clayton.","第二天，我回到了故乡克莱顿。"
"The new strange brightness of the world was all the brighter there, for the host of dark distressful memories, of darkened childhood, toilsome youth, embittered adolescence that wove about the place for me.","这个新奇而光明的世界在克莱顿显得更加生气勃勃，因为在我的记忆里，那个地方是不堪回首的。我在那里度过了暗无天日的童年，辛苦劳作的少年以及痛苦难捱的青年时代。"
"It seemed to me that I saw morning there for the first time.","我似乎是第一次在那里看到清晨。"
"No chimneys smoked that day, no furnaces were burning, the people were busy with other things.","那天烟囱没有冒出滚滚浓烟，火炉也没有熊熊燃烧，人们都在忙着其他事情。"
"The clear strong sun, the sparkle in the dustless air, made a strange gaiety in the narrow streets.","强烈的阳光穿过清新的空气，使狭窄的街道呈现出一派莫名的欢乐景象。"
"I passed a number of smiling people coming home from the public breakfasts that were given in the Town Hall until better things could be arranged, and happened on Parload among them.","我从很多人身边经过，他们个个都笑脸盈盈，刚刚享用完镇政府提供的公共早餐回家来。这种情况还会持续下去，直到事情得到更妥善的安排。我碰巧在其间遇到了帕罗德。"
"“You were right about that comet,” I sang out at the sight of him; and he came toward me and clasped my hand.","“关于彗星的说法，你是对的。”我一看到他就大声喊道。他朝着我走过来，一把握住了我的手。"
"“What are people doing here?”","“人们在这里在干什么呢？”"
"said I.","我问。"
"“They’re sending us food from outside,” he said, “and we’re going to level all these slums—and shift into tents on to the moors;” and he began to tell me of many things that were being arranged, the Midland land committees had got to work with remarkable celerity and directness of purpose, and the redistribution of population was already in its broad outlines planned.","“他们正从外面给我们送食物，”他说，“我们准备把这些贫民窟都夷为平地，然后在旷野里搭建帐篷。”他开始给我讲述许多正在筹划的事情，告诉我米德兰的土地委员会已经迅速地为这个明确的目的着手工作，人口重新分配的计划也已经有了粗略的提纲。"
"He was working at an improvised college of engineering.","目前他在一所临时工程学院工作。"
"Until schemes of work were made out, almost every one was going to school again to get as much technical training as they could against the demands of the huge enterprise of reconstruction that was now beginning.","在工作方案制定出来之前，几乎所有人都要再到学校，去接受尽可能多的技术培训，以满足正兴起的巨大的重建事业的需求。"
"He walked with me to my door, and there I met old Pettigrew coming down the steps.","他陪我一直走到家门前口，正巧遇见老佩迪格鲁从台阶上走下来。"
"He looked dusty and tired, but his eye was brighter than it used to be, and he carried in a rather unaccustomed manner, a workman’s tool basket.","他看起来灰头土脸、疲惫不堪，但是眼睛却比过去明亮多了。他扛着一个工人用的工具箱，看起来有些别扭。"
"“How’s the rheumatism, Mr. Pettigrew?”","“佩蒂格鲁先生，你的风湿病怎样了？”"
"I asked.","我问。"
"“Dietary,” said old Pettigrew, “can work wonders....”","“控制饮食的话，”老佩蒂格鲁说，“会创造奇迹的……”"
"He looked me in the eye.","他盯着我的眼睛。"
"“These houses,” he said, “will have to come down, I suppose, and our notions of property must undergo very considerable revision—in the light of reason; but meanwhile I’ve been doing something to patch that disgraceful roof of mine!","“这些房子，”他说，“我想得拆掉了。从理性的角度来说，我们的财产观必须经历相当大的修正，但是同时我又一直在修补我那见不得人的屋顶。"
"To think that I could have dodged and evaded—”","想到会拆掉，当初我就不应该动工——”"
"He raised a deprecatory hand, drew down the loose corners of his ample mouth, and shook his old head.","他自嘲地挥了一下手，撇了撇大嘴巴松弛的嘴角，摇了摇年迈的脑袋。"
"“The past is past, Mr. Pettigrew.”","“过去的就过去了，佩蒂格鲁先生。”"
"“Your poor dear mother!","“你那可怜的母亲！"
"So good and honest a woman!","如此善良真诚的一个女人啊！"
"So simple and kind and forgiving!","这么淳朴、友好而且宽容！"
"To think of it!","难以想象！"
"My dear young man!”—he said it manfully—“I’m ashamed.”","小伙子！”他很男子气地说，“我真的感到很遗憾。”"
"“The whole world blushed at dawn the other day, Mr. Pettigrew,” I said, “and did it very prettily.","“几天前的黎明时分，整个世界都脸红了，佩蒂格鲁先生，”我说，“红得很漂亮。"
"That’s over now.","现在事情结束了。"
"God knows, who is NOT ashamed of all that came before last Tuesday.”","天晓得，谁没有为上周二之前发生的一切感到惭愧。”"
"I held out a forgiving hand, naively forgetful that in this place I was a thief, and he took it and went his way, shaking his head and repeating he was ashamed, but I think a little comforted.","我伸出一只手表示宽容，忘记自己在这个地方曾是个小偷，这真的很幼稚。他握了握我的手，然后就走了，一边摇头一边重复说他很遗憾，但我却觉得有点儿欣慰。"
"The door opened and my poor old mother’s face, marvelously cleaned, appeared.","门打开了，出现了我可怜的老母亲那张特别干净的脸庞。"
"“Ah, Willie, boy!","“啊，威利，孩子！"
"YOU.","是你吗？"
"You!”","是你！”"
"I ran up the steps to her, for I feared she might fall.","我跑上台阶朝她迎去，担心她会摔倒。"
"How she clung to me in the passage, the dear woman!...","在走廊里，她紧紧地抱着我，我亲爱的母亲……"
"But first she shut the front door.","不过，她首先关上了前门。"
"The old habit of respect for my unaccountable temper still swayed her.","知道我脾气不定，她一直保持着先关前门的这个习惯。"
"“Ah deary!”","“噢，亲爱的！”"
"she said, “ah deary!","她叫道，“噢，宝贝儿！"
"But you were sorely tried,” and kept her face close to my shoulder, lest she should offend me by the sight of the tears that welled within her.","你累坏了。”她把脸凑近我的肩膀，唯恐她盈眶的泪水会让我不舒服。"
"She made a sort of gulping noise and was quiet for a while, holding me very tightly to her heart with her worn, long hands...","她喉咙里发出哽咽声，然后竭力平静下来，并用长满老茧的双手伸长紧紧地把我抱在胸前。"
"She thanked me presently for my telegram, and I put my arm about her and drew her into the living room.","而后她又感谢我发给她的电报。我双臂环绕着她，将她带到了客厅。"
"“It’s all well with me, mother dear,” I said, “and the dark times are over—are done with for ever, mother.”","“我很好，亲爱的母亲，”我说，“黑暗的时代已经结束了，永远结束了，母亲。”"
"Whereupon she had courage and gave way and sobbed aloud, none chiding her.","这时，她终于有勇气卸下负担，哭出声来，没有人会责备她。"
"She had not let me know she could still weep for five grimy years....","她没让我知道她还是在为过去五年艰苦的日子哭泣……"
"Section 2","第二节"
"Dear heart!","天啊！"
"There remained for her but a very brief while in this world that had been renewed.","这个新世界只留给她一段很短暂的时间了。"
"I did not know how short that time would be, but the little I could do—perhaps after all it was not little to her—to atone for the harshness of my days of wrath and rebellion, I did.","这段时间到底有多短我不知道，但做一丁点儿——也许对她来说这并不是微不足道——来弥补我往日的反叛给她造成的伤害，我是知道的。"
"I took care to be constantly with her, for I perceived now her curious need of me.","我每天小心翼翼地陪着她，因为我察觉到她现在很需要我。"
"It was not that we had ideas to exchange or pleasures to share, but she liked to see me at table, to watch me working, to have me go to and fro.","这并不是因为我们有什么想法要交流，有什么快乐要分享，只是她喜欢看着我吃饭，看着我做事，看着我走来走去。"
"There was no toil for her any more in the world, but only such light services as are easy and pleasant for a worn and weary old woman to do, and I think she was happy even at her end.","她在世上再也不用劳累了。对于一个行将就木的老人来说，只要做些轻松愉快的事就行了，我觉得即使她大限将至，她过得还是很幸福。"
"She kept to her queer old eighteenth century version of religion, too, without a change.","她还保留着18世纪古老的奇怪的宗教信仰，一点儿都没有改变。"
"She had worn this particular amulet so long it was a part of her.","这个特殊的护身符她戴了很长时间了，已经成了她的一部分。"
"Yet the Change was evident even in that persistence.","然而即便这么坚持，巨变的影响还是非常明显。"
"I said to her one day, “But do you still believe in that hell of flame, dear mother?","一天我对她说：“你还在相信地狱之火吗，亲爱的母亲？"
"You—with your tender heart!”","你——真的从内心相信这一切吗？”"
"She vowed she did.","她发誓说她坚信。"
"Some theological intricacy made it necessary to her, but still—","神学的玄妙使她不得不相信这些，不过——"
"She looked thoughtfully at a bank of primulas before her for a time, and then laid her tremulous hand impressively on my arm.","她若有所思地望着面前的一排报春花，盯了好长一会儿，然后颤抖地把手放在我的胳膊上，这让我印象深刻。"
"“You know, Willie, dear,” she said, as though she was clearing up a childish misunderstanding of mine, “I don’t think any one will GO there.","“威利，亲爱的，你知道，”她对我说，似乎是在纠正我的一种幼稚的误解，“我认为不会有人要去那里的。"
"I never DID think that....”","我从来没有那样想过……”"
"Section 3","第三节"
"That talk stands out in my memory because of that agreeable theological decision of hers, but it was only one of a great number of talks.","那次谈话我记得很清楚，是因为她那关于神学令人愉快的决定，不过那只是众多谈话中的一次。"
"It used to be pleasant in the afternoon, after the day’s work was done and before one went on with the evening’s study—how odd it would have seemed in the old time for a young man of the industrial class to be doing post-graduate work in sociology, and how much a matter of course it seems now!—to walk out into the gardens of Lowchester House, and smoke a cigarette or so and let her talk ramblingly of the things that interested her....","以前，下午的时光总是很惬意。白天的工作干完了，晚上的学习还没开始——过去，一个工人阶级的年轻人去做一些有关社会学的研究工作看起来那么奇怪，但如今似乎是理所当然的事情了！我们到罗切斯特宅院的花园里去散步，我抽上一支雪茄，听她漫无边际地讲一些她感兴趣的事情……"
"Physically the Great Change did not do so very much to reinvigorate her—she had lived in that dismal underground kitchen in Clayton too long for any material rejuvenescence—she glowed out indeed as a dying spark among the ashes might glow under a draught of fresh air—and assuredly it hastened her end.","从身体上来看，巨变没怎么使她恢复元气，却无疑是加速了她生命的结束。她在克莱顿阴暗的地下厨房里住得太久了，任何物质上的补救都没有用，她的脸上散发着光芒，就如同灰烬在遇到新鲜空气时发出的即将熄灭的火光一样。"
"But those closing days were very tranquil, full of an effortless contentment.","但临终前的那些日子，她过得很安静，也很满足。"
"With her, life was like a rainy, windy day that clears only to show the sunset afterglow.","和她在一起的生活就像风雨交加的日子，天空放晴时只为彰显夕阳的余晖。"
"The light has passed.","闪电已经结束了。"
"She acquired no new habits amid the comforts of the new life, did no new things, but only found a happier light upon the old.","在新生活的慰藉下，她并没有养成什么新习惯，也没做什么新鲜事，只是感到比从前更幸福。"
"She lived with a number of other old ladies belonging to our commune in the upper rooms of Lowchester House.","她和我们社区的其他许多老太太一同住在罗切斯特宅院的上层房间里。"
"Those upper apartments were simple and ample, fine and well done in the Georgian style, and they had been organized to give the maximum of comfort and conveniences and to economize the need of skilled attendance.","那些上层公寓既简朴又宽敞，造型精美，具有典型的乔治时代的风格，目的是给人提供最大限度的舒适与方便，以减少专业人员的照料。"
"We had taken over the various “great houses,” as they used to be called, to make communal dining-rooms and so forth—their kitchens were conveniently large—and pleasant places for the old people of over sixty whose time of ease had come, and for suchlike public uses.","我们早已接管各种各样的“大房子”（过去常这么叫），用来做成公共食堂之类——它们的厨房宽敞便利——以及一些令人愉快的场所，供花甲老人们享清福用，或者诸如此类的公共用途。"
"We had done this not only with Lord Redcar’s house, but also with Checkshill House—where old Mrs. Verrall made a dignified and capable hostess,—and indeed with most of the fine residences in the beautiful wide country between the Four Towns district and the Welsh mountains.","我们不仅对雷德卡勋爵的宅邸做了这样的改造，而且对切克希利宅院同样如此。老维罗尔太太曾是切克希利宅子里一位高贵能干的女主人。事实上，我们对位于四镇区和威尔士山间美丽而广阔的乡村里的大部分精美宅第都做了这样的处理。"
"About these great houses there had usually been good outbuildings, laundries, married servants’ quarters, stabling, dairies, and the like, suitably masked by trees, we turned these into homes, and to them we added first tents and wood chalets and afterward quadrangular residential buildings.","这些大宅周围通常都有不错的外屋、洗衣房、已婚仆人的住房、马厩以及牛奶场等等，全都恰如其分地掩映在树丛中。我们把这些改成住房，先是添了些帐篷和木屋，后来又修了些四边形的居民住宅。"
"In order to be near my mother I had two small rooms in the new collegiate buildings which our commune was almost the first to possess, and they were very convenient for the station of the high-speed electric railway that took me down to our daily conferences and my secretarial and statistical work in Clayton.","为了离我母亲近一点儿，我在这些新的学院式建筑里找了两间小屋，我们的社区几乎是最先占据了这些建筑。从这里去高速电气火车站很便捷，我每天都坐火车去克莱顿参加日常讨论会以及做一些秘书和统计工作。"
"Ours had been one of the first modern communes to get in order; we were greatly helped by the energy of Lord Redcar, who had a fine feeling for the picturesque associations of his ancestral home—the detour that took our line through the beeches and bracken and bluebells of the West Wood and saved the pleasant open wildness of the park was one of his suggestions; and we had many reasons to be proud of our surroundings.","我们的社区曾是步入正轨的第一批现代社区之一，这多亏了雷德卡勋爵的鼎力相助，他对家传祖屋之间别致的结合独具慧眼。我们开辟了一条弯弯的小路，穿过西部森林的山毛榉、欧洲蕨和风铃草，保留了公园里令人愉悦的荒野的韵味，这就是他其中的一条建议。周围的环境有许多值得我们骄傲的理由。"
"Nearly all the other communes that sprang up all over the pleasant parkland round the industrial valley of the Four Towns, as the workers moved out, came to us to study the architecture of the residential squares and quadrangles with which we had replaced the back streets between the great houses and the ecclesiastical residences about the cathedral, and the way in which we had adapted all these buildings to our new social needs.","四镇工业谷周围的公用场地上涌现出一些其他的社区。工人搬出去时，几乎所有这些社区都来到我们这里学习居民广场和四边形房屋的建造。我们用这些建筑替换掉了大宅与教堂周围牧师住宅之间的后街，他们也来学习我们改造所有的建筑物以适应新的社会需求的方式。"
"Some claimed to have improved on us.","有一些还声称其在我们的基础上有所发展。"
"But they could not emulate the rhododendron garden out beyond our shrubberies; that was a thing altogether our own in our part of England, because of its ripeness and of the rarity of good peat free from lime.","但他们却无法跟我们灌木丛外的杜鹃花园相媲美。在英格兰这片土地上，那完全是我们独有的，因为花园里百花争艳，还有罕见的没有石灰的泥煤。"
"These gardens had been planned under the third Lord Redcar, fifty years ago and more; they abounded in rhododendra and azaleas, and were in places so well sheltered and sunny that great magnolias flourished and flowered.","这些花园大概是50多年前在雷德卡勋爵三世时设计的。园里有大量各种各样的杜鹃花，由于地势优越，阳光充足，因此玉兰花茁壮成长，花满枝头。"
"There were tall trees smothered in crimson and yellow climbing roses, and an endless variety of flowering shrubs and fine conifers, and such pampas grass as no other garden can show.","园里那些参天大树，掩映在绯红和嫩黄的攀援蔷薇之中，还有各种类型开花的灌木丛和漂亮的针叶树，以及其他花园所没有的潘帕斯草地。"
"And barred by the broad shadows of these, were glades and broad spaces of emerald turf, and here and there banks of pegged roses, and flower-beds, and banks given over some to spring bulbs, and some to primroses and primulas and polyanthuses.","绿阴下是大片的林中空地和翠绿色的草皮，各处可见篱笆，有些篱笆里面是零星的玫瑰和花坛，有些篱笆里面是球茎植物，还有一些则是报春花以及各种樱草花。"
"My mother loved these latter banks and the little round staring eyes of their innumerable yellow, ruddy brown, and purple corollas, more than anything else the gardens could show, and in the spring of the Year of Scaffolding she would go with me day after day to the seat that showed them in the greatest multitude.","我母亲喜欢后几种篱笆，以及它们里面那数不清的黄色、红棕色和紫色的花冠，好似一只只瞪得圆圆的小眼睛，这是其他花园所无法比拟的。在重建那一年的春天，我们天天都会去一个欣赏这些美景的最佳位置。"
"It gave her, I think, among other agreeable impressions, a sense of gentle opulence.","我觉得，这除了带给她一些愉快的感觉外，还给她带来一丝轻微的满足感。"
"In the old time she had never known what it was to have more than enough of anything agreeable in the world at all.","过去她从来不知道拥有世上这么多美好的事物是什么感觉。"
"We would sit and think, or talk—there was a curious effect of complete understanding between us whether we talked or were still.","我们会坐下来想事情或者聊天。令人奇怪的是，无论是聊天还是沉默，彼此之间都有一种默契，彼此能够心领神会。"
"“Heaven,” she said to me one day, “Heaven is a garden.”","“天堂，”有一天她对我讲，“天堂是一座花园。”"
"I was moved to tease her a little.","我禁不住想揶揄她一下。"
"“There’s jewels, you know, walls and gates of jewels—and singing.”","“你知道，那里有珠宝，堆砌如山的珠宝——还有音乐。”"
"“For such as like them,” said my mother firmly, and thought for a while.","“诸如此类的东西，”母亲想了一会儿，然后坚定地说，"
"“There’ll be things for all of us, o’ course.","“我们大家都会有的，那是自然不过的。"
"But for me it couldn’t be Heaven, dear, unless it was a garden—a nice sunny garden....","但是对我来说，那不可能是天堂，宝贝儿，除非它是一座花园——一座漂亮的、洒满阳光的花园……"
"And feeling such as we’re fond of, are close and handy by”","而且在那里，我们喜欢的那种感觉触手可及。”"
"You of your happier generation cannot realize the wonderfulness of those early days in the new epoch, the sense of security, the extraordinary effects of contrast.","你们这一代比我们要幸福，你不可能体会到新时代初期的无限精彩，还有那种安全感以及与旧时代对比产生的非凡的影响。"
"In the morning, except in high summer, I was up before dawn, and breakfasted upon the swift, smooth train, and perhaps saw the sunrise as I rushed out of the little tunnel that pierced Clayton Crest, and so to work like a man.","每天早晨，除了盛夏，我都是天亮前就起床，然后在飞速平稳的火车上吃完早餐，有时火车冲出穿过克莱顿峰顶的小隧道时我还能看到日出，然后有模有样地开始工作。"
"Now that we had got all the homes and schools and all the softness of life away from our coal and iron ore and clay, now that a thousand obstructive “rights” and timidities had been swept aside, we could let ourselves go, we merged this enterprise with that, cut across this or that anciently obstructive piece of private land, joined and separated, effected gigantic consolidations and gigantic economies, and the valley, no longer a pit of squalid human tragedies and meanly conflicting industries, grew into a sort of beauty of its own, a savage inhuman beauty of force and machinery and flames.","既然除了煤、铁矿和黏土之外我们还得到了住宅、学校以及生活中所有的温馨。既然千百种碍事的“权利”和胆怯都已被放到一边，我们便可放手一搏。我们将各个企业合并起来，径直穿过一片片向来就碍事的私有土地，通过联合或者分散，实现巨大的产业合并和经济效益。这片山谷不再上演凄惨的人间悲剧，不再有相互冲突的工业，而是变成一片美丽之地。那种美充斥着力量、机械和火焰，有些野蛮和残酷。"
"One was a Titan in that Etna.","那是埃特纳山中的提坦。"
"Then back one came at midday to bath and change in the train, and so to the leisurely gossiping lunch in the club dining-room in Lowchester House, and the refreshment of these green and sunlit afternoon tranquillities.","人们正午回来的时候，就在火车上洗澡更衣，到罗切斯特大宅的餐厅里一边悠闲地享用午餐，一边说长道短。翠绿的色彩让人精神爽快，阳光灿烂的午后让人心神宁静。"
"Sometimes in her profounder moments my mother doubted whether all this last phase of her life was not a dream.","有时候母亲会细细地思考，怀疑自己生命的最后一段旅程是否是一场梦。"
"“A dream,” I used to say, “a dream indeed—but a dream that is one step nearer awakening than that nightmare of the former days.”","“一场梦，”我过去常说，“的确是一场梦，不过与从前的噩梦相比，这场梦离清醒更近一步。”"
"She found great comfort and assurance in my altered clothes—she liked the new fashions of dress, she alleged.","从我不断更换的服装里她找到了巨大的安慰和保障，她宣称说她喜欢新的服装款式。"
"It was not simply altered clothes.","那不仅仅是服装的改变。"
"I did grow two inches, broaden some inches round my chest, and increase in weight three stones before I was twenty-three.","23岁以前，我确实长高了两英寸，胸围有所加宽，体重增加了42磅。"
"I wore a soft brown cloth and she would caress my sleeve and admire it greatly—she had the woman’s sense of texture very strong in her.","我穿了一件棕色的深色上衣，她会摸着我的衣袖赞叹不已。她有着妇女那种对布料的极强的辨别力。"
"Sometimes she would muse upon the past, rubbing together her poor rough hands—they never got softened—one over the other.","有时母亲会缅怀往事，不停搓着她那双粗糙的双手——它们从来都没有变得柔软过——一只手在另一只手上边。"
"She told me much I had not heard before about my father, and her own early life.","她告诉我许多以前我从未听过的有关父亲的事情，以及她自己早年的生活。"
"It was like finding flat and faded flowers in a book still faintly sweet, to realize that once my mother had been loved with passion; that my remote father had once shed hot tears of tenderness in her arms.","那就像是在书本里发现了扁平褪色却仍散发着芳香的花瓣，我意识到母亲曾经深爱过，我那早已逝去的父亲曾在她怀里掉下了深情的泪水。"
"And she would sometimes even speak tentatively in those narrow, old-world phrases that her lips could rob of all their bitter narrowness, of Nettie.","有时母亲会尝试性地用一些含蓄的旧世界的说法来谈及妮蒂，这样她的话听起来就不会尖刻。"
"“She wasn’t worthy of you, dear,” she would say abruptly, leaving me to guess the person she intended.","“她配不上你，亲爱的。”她常会突然冒出这样一句，让我去猜她想说的那个人是谁。"
"“No man is worthy of a woman’s love,” I answered.","“没有哪个男人配拥有一个女人的爱，”我回答说，"
"“No woman is worthy of a man’s.","“也没有哪个女人配拥有一个男人的爱。"
"I love her, dear mother, and that you cannot alter.”","我爱她，亲爱的母亲，这一点你无法改变。”"
"“There’s others,” she would muse.","“还有其他的女人呀。”她会若有所思地说。"
"“Not for me,” I said.","“不适合我，”我说，"
"“No!","“不！"
"I didn’t fire a shot that time; I burnt my magazine.","我那时没有开枪，我烧了我的杂志。"
"I can’t begin again, mother, not from the beginning.”","我不能重新开始了，母亲，不能从头再来了。”"
"She sighed and said no more then.","她叹了口气，然后便没再说什么。"
"At another time she said—I think her words were: “You’ll be lonely when I’m gone dear.”","还有一次她说——我想她是这样说的：“我走后你会孤独的，宝贝儿。”"
"“You’ll not think of going, then,” I said.","“那你就不要想着走的事。”我说。"
"“Eh, dear!","“啊，亲爱的！"
"but man and maid should come together.”","男人和女人是应该要结合在一起的。”"
"I said nothing to that.","我缄口不言。"
"“You brood overmuch on Nettie, dear.","“你想妮蒂想得太多了，宝贝儿。"
"If I could see you married to some sweet girl of a woman, some good, KIND girl—”","如果我能看到你和一个甜美、善良的好姑娘结婚的话——”"
"“Dear mother, I’m married enough.","“亲爱的母亲，我会结婚的。"
"Perhaps some day—Who knows?","也许有一天——谁知道呢？"
"I can wait.”","我可以等。”"
"“But to have nothing to do with women!”","“不过那跟女人没有关系！”"
"“I have my friends.","“我有自己的朋友。"
"Don’t you trouble, mother.","不要担心，母亲。"
"There’s plentiful work for a man in this world though the heart of love is cast out from him.","一个男人心中虽然不再有爱，但他在世界上还有许多事情要做。"
"Nettie was life and beauty for me—is—will be.","妮蒂过去是——现在是——将来还是我的生命，是我心中的美人。"
"Don’t think I’ve lost too much, mother.”","不要以为我失去太多了，母亲。”"
"(Because in my heart I told myself the end had still to come.)","（因为我在心里告诉自己，事情会有个了结的。）"
"And once she sprang a question on me suddenly that surprised me.","曾经有一次她突然冒出一个问题，使我吃了一惊。"
"“Where are they now?”","“他们现在在哪儿？”"
"she asked.","她问道。"
"“Who?”","“谁呀？”"
"“Nettie and—him.”","“妮蒂和——那个他。”"
"She had pierced to the marrow of my thoughts.","她已经看穿了我的心思。"
"“I don’t know,” I said shortly.","“我不清楚，”我简短地答道。"
"Her shriveled hand just fluttered into touch of mine.","她干枯的手颤抖地摸了一下我的手。"
"“It’s better so,” she said, as if pleading.","“这样更好。”她说，仿佛是在恳求，"
"“Indeed , , , it is better so.”","“的确……这样更好。”"
"There was something in her quivering old voice that for a moment took me back across an epoch, to the protests of the former time, to those counsels of submission, those appeals not to offend It, that had always stirred an angry spirit of rebellion within me.","有一刻，她颤抖苍老的声音里某种东西把我带回到前一个时代，使我看到旧时的反抗，使我听到那些劝我顺从的忠告和让我别得罪上帝的呼吁。那时这些话总是在我心里激起一种反叛而愤怒的情绪。"
"“That is the thing I doubt,” I said, and abruptly I felt I could talk no more to her of Nettie.","“这就是我所怀疑的事情。”我说道，突然觉得不可以再和她谈论妮蒂。"
"I got up and walked away from her, and came back after a while, to speak of other things, with a bunch of daffodils for her in my hand.","我起身走开，过了一会儿又走回来，手里拿着一束给她的水仙花，和她谈起别的事来。"
"But I did not always spend my afternoons with her.","不过我并不总是和她一起度过下午的时光。"
"There were days when my crushed hunger for Nettie rose again, and then I had to be alone; I walked, or bicycled, and presently I found a new interest and relief in learning to ride.","有些日子，我思念妮蒂心切，便不得不一个人独处。我出去散散步或者骑骑自行车，不久又在学骑马的过程中找到了一种新的兴趣和安慰。"
"For the horse was already very swiftly reaping the benefit to the Change.","因为马已经迅速地尝到了巨变带来的好处。"
"Hardly anywhere was the inhumanity of horse traction to be found after the first year of the new epoch, everywhere lugging and dragging and straining was done by machines, and the horse had become a beautiful instrument for the pleasure and carriage of youth.","新纪元的第一年之后，任何地方都找不到用马驮东西这种不人道的现象了。拖、拉等重活都是由机器完成，而马则已经成为一种漂亮的工具，用来给人带去欢乐，用来承载青春。"
"I rode both in the saddle and, what is finer, naked and barebacked.","我会装上马鞍骑马，有时也会不装，而不装马鞍会更有意思。"
"I found violent exercises were good for the states of enormous melancholy that came upon me, and when at last horse riding palled, I went and joined the aviators who practised soaring upon aeroplanes beyond Horsemarden Hill....","我发现当我极度忧郁时，剧烈运动大有好处。当最终我对骑马感到腻烦时，我就到霍斯马登山那一边去和飞行员一起练习飞行……"
"But at least every alternate day I spent with my mother, and altogether I think I gave her two-thirds of my afternoons.","但是我至少隔一天就会和母亲呆在一起，总共算起来，有三分之二的下午时光我都是和她一起度过的。"
"Section 4","第四节"
"When presently that illness, that fading weakness that made an euthanasia for so many of the older people in the beginning of the new time, took hold upon my mother, there came Anna Reeves to daughter her—after our new custom.","新时代之初，许多老年人都染上一种病，身体越来越虚弱，最后安乐地死去。我的母亲也得了这种病，根据我们的新习俗，安娜·里夫斯来照料她。"
"She chose to come.","她是自愿来的。"
"She was already known to us a little from chance meetings and chance services she had done my mother in the garden; she sought to give her help.","在花园里，她偶然碰到过我母亲，帮她做过一些事，因此我们大家都认识她，她想方设法要给我母亲帮忙。"
"She seemed then just one of those plainly good girls the world at its worst has never failed to produce, who were indeed in the dark old times the hidden antiseptic of all our hustling, hating, faithless lives.","那时她看起来就只是一个普通的好姑娘，这样的女孩儿即使是在世风最坏时也是不缺的。她们实际上就是黑暗的旧时代里隐匿在我们相互推挤、充满仇恨和毫无信念的生活的除菌剂。"
"They made their secret voiceless worship, they did their steadfast, uninspired, unthanked, unselfish work as helpful daughters, as nurses, as faithful servants, as the humble providences of homes.","作为勤快的女儿、护士、忠诚的仆人、家庭中谦卑的掌舵者，她们默默无闻地崇拜着、任劳任怨不计回报慷慨无私地工作着。"
"She was almost exactly three years older than I.","她长我几乎整整三岁。"
"At first I found no beauty in her, she was short but rather sturdy and ruddy, with red-tinged hair, and fair hairy brows and red-brown eyes.","起初我一点儿没觉得她漂亮。她个子不高但身体结实，脸色红润，头发略带红色，眉毛浓密，眼睛是棕红色的。"
"But her freckled hands I found, were full of apt help, her voice carried good cheer....","但是我发现她那双布满斑点的手很乐于助人，嗓音里带着欢乐……"
"At first she was no more than a blue-clad, white-aproned benevolence, that moved in the shadows behind the bed on which my old mother lay and sank restfully to death.","起初我觉得她只不过是一个穿着蓝色上衣，系着白色围裙的善良的女孩儿，在我老母亲临终的病床前来回伺候。"
"She would come forward to anticipate some little need, to proffer some simple comfort, and always then my mother smiled on her.","她会走上前看看母亲是不是有什么需要，给她一点儿安慰，而我母亲就总是对她微笑。"
"In a little while I discovered the beauty of that helpful poise of her woman’s body, I discovered the grace of untiring goodness, the sweetness of a tender pity, and the great riches of her voice, of her few reassuring words and phrases.","没隔多久，我就发现了她的美丽：她身材匀称，心地善良，温柔贤惠，善解人意，少言寡语却句句说到人的心坎儿上。"
"I noted and remembered very clearly how once my mother’s lean old hand patted the firm gold-flecked strength of hers, as it went by upon its duties with the coverlet.","我曾注意到并且清楚地记得当她用满是斑点却强壮有力的手叠弄被单时，母亲用枯瘦苍老的手轻轻拍了拍那双手。"
"“She is a good girl to me,” said my mother one day.","“在我看来她是个好姑娘。”有一天母亲说，"
"“A good girl.","“是个好姑娘。"

"I never had a daughter—really.”","我从未有过女儿——真的。”"
"She mused peacefully for a space.","她静静地想了一会儿，"
"“Your little sister died,” she said.","“你小姐姐死得早。”她说。"
"I had never heard of that little sister.","我从没听说过我还有个姐姐。"
"“November the tenth,” said my mother.","“11月10日，”母亲说道。"

"I cried.","我哭呀哭。"
"I cried.","哭呀哭。"
"That was before you came, dear.","那时你还没出生，宝贝儿。"
"So long ago—and I can see it now.","很久以前的事了——可现在我都还记得清清楚楚。"
"I was a young wife then, and your father was very kind.","那时我还是个年轻的小媳妇，你父亲非常善良。"
"But I can see its hands, its dear little quiet hands....","但是我还记得她那双手，那双小小的，柔软的手……"
"Dear, they say that now—now they will not let the little children die.”","亲爱的，他们说现在——现在是不会让小孩儿死去的。”"
"“No, dear mother,” I said.","“是的，亲爱的母亲，”我说，"
"“We shall do better now.”","“现在我们做得好多了。”"
"“The club doctor could not come.","“俱乐部的医生不能来。"
"Your father went twice.","你父亲跑了两趟。"
"There was some one else, some one who paid.","说是另有别人已经付过定金。"
"So your father went on into Swathinglea, and that man wouldn’t come unless he had his fee.","因此你父亲只得赶去斯沃星利。但是那个医生不肯来，说除非他先收费。"
"And your father had changed his clothes to look more respectful and he hadn’t any money, not even his tram fare home.","你父亲之前换了套衣服，为了看起来体面点儿，他身上一点儿钱也没有，甚至连回家的车费都没有。"
"It seemed cruel to be waiting there with my baby thing in pain....","孩子生着病，而我们能做的就只是等待，这似乎有些残忍。"
"And I can’t help thinking perhaps we might have saved her....","我现在还禁不住会想，或许我们本可以救活她……"
"But it was like that with the poor always in the bad old times—always.","但是在糟糕的旧时代，穷人的情况总是那样——一直都是。"
"When the doctor came at last he was angry.","医生终于来了，他非常气愤。"
"‘Why wasn’t I called before?’","‘为什么不早点儿叫我？’"
"he said, and he took no pains.","他说道，没有一点儿同情。"
"He was angry because some one hadn’t explained.","他生气是因为没人向他解释原因。"
"I begged him—but it was too late.”","我可是求过他的——可是一切都晚了。”"
"She said these things very quietly with drooping eyelids, like one who describes a dream.","她说这些事情的时候，非常平静，低垂着眼皮，就像是在讲述一个梦。"
"“We are going to manage all these things better now,” I said, feeling a strange resentment at this pitiful little story her faded, matter-of-fact voice was telling me.","“现在我们会把这些事情做得更好的。”在听了她用微弱而平淡的声调说出这个让人心痛的小故事时，我竟然感到一种奇怪的愤恨。"
"“She talked,” my mother went on.","“她说话了，”母亲继续说着，"
"“She talked for her age wonderfully....","“以她的年龄来说，她已经讲得非常好了……"
"Hippopotamus.”","河马。”"
"“Eh?”","“啊？”"
"I said.","我问。"
"“Hippopotamus, dear—quite plainly one day, when her father was showing her pictures... And her little prayers.","“河马，亲爱的——很平常的一天，就在他父亲给她看图片时……她还会念祷文。"

"She whispered other vague things, little sentences, ghosts of long dead moments....","她低声细语、含糊不清地说了些别的事情，断断续续地，什么早已死去的鬼魂之类。"
"Her words grew less distinct.","她的话越来越不清晰。"
"Presently she was asleep and I got up and went out of the room, but my mind was queerly obsessed by the thought of that little life that had been glad and hopeful only to pass so inexplicably out of hope again into nonentity, this sister of whom I had never heard before....","她睡着了，我起身走出房间，但奇怪的是，脑海里怎么也摆脱不了那个快乐的小生命，充满希望，却莫名其妙地化作乌有的姐姐，而我从来都没听说过她……"
"And presently I was in a black rage at all the irrecoverable sorrows of the past, of that great ocean of avoidable suffering of which this was but one luminous and quivering red drop.","对过去所有那些无法挽救的不幸以及遭受的本可以避免的巨大痛苦，我感到极度的愤怒，而这件事只不过记得更清楚而已。"
"I walked in the garden and the garden was too small for me; I went out to wander on the moors.","我在花园里散步，觉得花园的空间对于我来说太小了，于是我走了出去，在旷野里漫步。"
"“The past is past,” I cried, and all the while across the gulf of five and twenty years I could hear my poor mother’s heart-wrung weeping for that daughter baby who had suffered and died.","“过去的都已经过去了。”我大声叫道，似乎一直能听见25年前母亲为病死的姐姐所发出的痛彻心扉的哭声。"
"Indeed that old spirit of rebellion has not altogether died in me, for all the transformation of the new time....","事实上，尽管已经来到新时代，我原有的反叛精神却还没完全消失……"
"I quieted down at last to a thin and austere comfort in thinking that the whole is not told to us, that it cannot perhaps be told to such minds as ours; and anyhow, and what was far more sustaining, that now we have strength and courage and this new gift of wise love, whatever cruel and sad things marred the past, none of these sorrowful things that made the very warp and woof of the old life, need now go on happening.","最后我在一丝苦涩的安慰中平静下来，心想母亲并没有将整件事情告诉我们，或许她没法对我们这样的人讲这种事。不管怎样，更持久的事情是我们现在拥有力量、勇气以及明智的爱情，无论过去发生的事多么残忍、悲伤，这种让生活痛苦不堪的事情不会再发生了。"
"We could foresee, we could prevent and save.","我们能够预测、阻止并且挽救。"
"“The past is past,” I said, between sighing and resolve, as I came into view again on my homeward way of the hundred sunset-lit windows of old Lowchester House.","“过去的都已经过去了。”我无可奈何却又下定决心地说道。在回家的路上，我再次看到罗切斯特老宅院里那些沐浴在夕阳下的窗户。"
"“Those sorrows are sorrows no more.”","“那些悲伤不会再成为悲伤。”"
"But I could not altogether cheat that common sadness of the new time, that memory, and insoluble riddle of the countless lives that had stumbled and failed in pain and darkness before our air grew clear.","然而我却无法完全摆脱新时代常见的伤心事，摆脱不了回忆，也摆脱不了无数生命里那解不开的谜底，他们在空气变清新之前在黑暗中跌跌撞撞，屡屡受挫。"

"Chapter the Third","第三章"
"Beltane and New Year’s Eve","燃烧节和除夕"
"Section 1","第一节"
"IN the end my mother died rather suddenly, and her death came as a shock to me.","后来我母亲去世得很突然，她的离世让我感到震惊。"
"Diagnosis was still very inadequate at that time.","那时的诊断仍然不够先进。"
"The doctors were, of course, fully alive to the incredible defects of their common training and were doing all they could to supply its deficiencies, but they were still extraordinarily ignorant.","当然那些医生充分意识到了平常训练当中令人难以置信的缺陷，并且正竭尽全力弥补这一不足，但他们还是相当无知。"
"Some unintelligently observed factor of her illness came into play with her, and she became feverish and sank and died very quickly.","有些医生给她做检查时粗心大意，导致她病情恶化，开始发烧，身体垮了下去，结果很快就去世了。"
"I do not know what remedial measures were attempted.","我不知道医生采用了什么医疗措施。"
"I hardly knew what was happening until the whole thing was over.","直到整个事情结束，我几乎都不清楚发生了什么事。"
"At that time my attention was much engaged by the stir of the great Beltane festival that was held on May-day in the Year of Scaffolding.","那时，我大部分注意力都集中在重建年5月1日举办的盛大的五月燃烧节。"
"It was the first of the ten great rubbish burnings that opened the new age.","共举行了十次大型垃圾焚烧，第一次燃烧拉开了新时代的序幕。"
"Young people nowadays can scarcely hope to imagine the enormous quantities of pure litter and useless accumulation with which we had to deal; had we not set aside a special day and season, the whole world would have been an incessant reek of small fires; and it was, I think, a happy idea to revive this ancient festival of the May and November burnings.","现在的年轻人几乎不能想象我们必须处理大量的垃圾和一些没用的东西。如果我们不抽出一个特别的日子和特别的季节来处理垃圾，那整个世界就会持续散发出浓烈的烟火味。我觉得，恢复5月和11月的燃烧节真是一个好主意。"
"It was inevitable that the old idea of purification should revive with the name, it was felt to be a burning of other than material encumbrances, innumerable quasi-spiritual things, deeds, documents, debts, vindictive records, went up on those great flares.","“净化”这一古老的观念应该如其词词义一样得到恢复。在熊熊烈火上燃烧不仅仅只是无数的伪劣产品、契约、文件、债券以及恶意的记录。"
"People passed praying between the fires, and it was a fine symbol of the new and wiser tolerance that had come to men, that those who still found their comfort in the orthodox faiths came hither unpersuaded, to pray that all hate might be burnt out of their professions.","人们一边绕着火堆转，一边祈祷，这标志着人们新生的更加明智的宽容。有些人仍能从传统的信仰中找到安慰，他们不请自来，祈祷所有对他们职业的仇恨都化为灰烬。"
"For even in the fires of Baal, now that men have done with base hatred, one may find the living God.","甚至在巴尔火节里，只要人们处理了仇恨，他们就有可能找到活生生的上帝。"
"Endless were the things we had to destroy in those great purgings.","我们有数不清的东西要销毁清除。"
"First, there were nearly all the houses and buildings of the old time.","首当其冲的是几乎所有旧时代的房屋和建筑。"
"In the end we did not save in England one building in five thousand that was standing when the comet came.","结果，对于彗星来临时在英格兰矗立的5000幢建筑物，我们一幢也没保留。"
"Year by year, as we made our homes afresh in accordance with the saner needs of our new social families, we swept away more and more of those horrible structures, the ancient residential houses, hastily built, without imagination, without beauty, without common honesty, without even comfort or convenience, in which the early twentieth century had sheltered until scarcely one remained; we saved nothing but what was beautiful or interesting out of all their gaunt and melancholy abundance.","年复一年，为了与新式家庭的社会需求保持一致，我们把自己的房屋修整一新，清除了越来越多结构糟糕的古老住宅，几乎一座都没留下。那些房屋修建得仓促，缺乏想象力，缺少美感，甚至连舒适和方便都说不上，是20世纪初期建造的。除了一些美观或因为带点儿荒凉忧郁气息而有趣的建筑物外，我们什么也没留下。"
"The actual houses, of course, we could not drag to our fires, but we brought all their ill-fitting deal doors, their dreadful window sashes, their servant-tormenting staircases, their dank, dark cupboards, the verminous papers from their scaly walls, their dust and dirt-sodden carpets, their ill-designed and yet pretentious tables and chairs, sideboards and chests of drawers, the old dirt-saturated books, their ornaments—their dirty, decayed, and altogether painful ornaments—amidst which I remember there were sometimes even STUFFED DEAD BIRDS!—we burnt them all.","当然，那些实实在在的房屋，我们没有拖去燃烧，不过那些关不严实的门、糟糕的窗框、难爬的楼梯、潮湿又阴暗的橱柜、从墙上这一块那一块撕下的脏纸、沾满灰尘的地毯、设计拙劣却自以为是的桌椅、餐具柜和抽屉、脏兮兮的旧书和满是灰尘已几近坏掉的装饰品统统都被我们烧了。我记得在其间有时还发现过为制作标本而剥制的小鸟。"
"The paint-plastered woodwork, with coat above coat of nasty paint, that in particular blazed finely.","那些刷了一层又一层灰泥的木制品在火中烧得特别旺。"
"I have already tried to give you an impression of old-world furniture, of Parload’s bedroom, my mother’s room, Mr. Gabbitas’s sitting-room, but, thank Heaven!","我已经尽力让你们对旧时代的家具、帕罗德的卧室、我母亲的房间和加比塔斯先生的客厅有个印象，不过，谢天谢地！"
"there is nothing in life now to convey the peculiar dinginess of it all.","现在生活里没有什么东西会那么脏了。"
"For one thing, there is no more imperfect combustion of coal going on everywhere, and no roadways like grassless open scars along the earth from which dust pours out perpetually.","一方面，现在到处都见不到没完全燃烧的煤，公路也不再像寸草不生、尘土飞扬的岩壁。"
"We burnt and destroyed most of our private buildings and all the woodwork, all our furniture, except a few score thousand pieces of distinct and intentional beauty, from which our present forms have developed, nearly all our hangings and carpets, and also we destroyed almost every scrap of old-world clothing.","除了几千件特意制作的特别精美的家具外（我们现有的家具形式就是在其基础上发展起来的），我们焚烧摧毁了大部分私人住宅、全部木制品和家具以及几乎所有的悬挂装饰物和地毯，并且我们还几乎毁掉了所有的旧式服装。"
"Only a few carefully disinfected types and vestiges of that remain now in our museums.","其中只有几种经过仔细消毒的衣服和残余碎片现在还留在博物馆里。"
"One writes now with a peculiar horror of the dress of the old world.","人们现在写到关于旧世界的服装时，会感到特别恐怖。"
"The men’s clothes were worn without any cleansing process at all, except an occasional superficial brushing, for periods of a year or so; they were made of dark obscurely mixed patterns to conceal the stage of defilement they had reached, and they were of a felted and porous texture admirably calculated to accumulate drifting matter.","男人们的衣服除了偶尔刷刷表面外，穿一年左右都不会洗一次；衣服是黑色系的，脏了也看不出来，其面料是毡制的，多孔，估计容易吸附灰尘之类的东西。"
"Many women wore skirts of similar substances, and of so long and inconvenient a form that they inevitably trailed among all the abomination of our horse-frequented roads.","许多妇女穿的裙子用的也是类似的布料，裙子太长，很不方便，所以她们在马匹频繁过往的路上也不可避免地要拖着走。"
"It was our boast in England that the whole of our population was booted—their feet were for the most part ugly enough to need it,—but it becomes now inconceivable how they could have imprisoned their feet in the amazing cases of leather and imitations of leather they used.","让我们引以为荣的是，在英格兰，所有人都穿靴子——他们的脚大多数都很丑，需要靴子来遮掩——不过，他们怎么会忍受把脚裹在真皮或仿皮靴子里，这真是不可思议。"
"I have heard it said that a large part of the physical decline that was apparent in our people during the closing years of the nineteenth century, though no doubt due in part to the miscellaneous badness of the food they ate, was in the main attributable to the vileness of the common footwear.","我听说19世纪后期大多数人体质明显下降的原因（虽然部分归因于他们食用的劣质食物）主要在于这种普通鞋子造成的伤害。"
"They shirked open-air exercise altogether because their boots wore out ruinously and pinched and hurt them if they took it.","他们避免参加户外运动，因为他们把鞋穿坏了，如果进行运动，靴子会夹痛并伤到他们的脚。"
"I have mentioned, I think, the part my own boots played in the squalid drama of my adolescence.","我想我已经提到过，在我悲惨的青年时代，我的靴子起到的作用。"
"I had a sense of unholy triumph over a fallen enemy when at last I found myself steering truck after truck of cheap boots and shoes (unsold stock from Swathinglea) to the run-off by the top of the Glanville blast furnaces.","当最后我把一车一车的廉价靴子和鞋子（斯沃星利没有卖出的存货）运到格兰维勒火炉的顶端时，我有一种战胜了敌人后的落井下石的胜利感。"
"“Plup!”","“啪！”"
"they would drop into the cone when Beltane came, and the roar of their burning would fill the air.","燃烧节来临的时候，这些靴子就会被扔进火堆里，空气里弥漫着熊熊燃烧的声响。"
"Never a cold would come from the saturation of their brown paper soles, never a corn from their foolish shapes, never a nail in them get home at last in suffering flesh....","他们不会再因常穿棕色的纸制靴底而感冒，不会因靴子愚蠢的形状而长鸡眼，也不会在最后到家时因鞋底的钉子而使脚丫子遭罪……"
"Most of our public buildings we destroyed and burnt as we reshaped our plan of habitation, our theater sheds, our banks, and inconvenient business warrens, our factories (these in the first year of all), and all the “unmeaning repetition” of silly little sham Gothic churches and meeting-houses, mean looking shells of stone and mortar without love, invention, or any beauty at all in them, that men had thrust into the face of their sweated God, even as they thrust cheap food into the mouths of their sweated workers; all these we also swept away in the course of that first decade.","我们在重新制定居住计划时，摧毁、烧掉了大部分公共建筑，就是那些剧院、银行、拥挤的商业场所、工厂（这些是在第一年摧毁的）以及所有对哥特式小教堂及会议厅愚蠢赝品的“呆板的复制”。这些建筑是用石头和灰浆砌成的，外观看起来很低劣，没有生气，缺乏创造力和美感。人们把这些推倒在上帝面前，甚至就像是把便宜的食物推到辛勤劳作的工人嘴里，所有这些建筑物我们在头十年就毁掉了。"
"Then we had the whole of the superseded steam-railway system to scrap and get rid of, stations, signals, fences, rolling stock; a plant of ill-planned, smoke-distributing nuisance apparatus, that would, under former conditions, have maintained an offensive dwindling obstructive life for perhaps half a century.","接着我们废弃了火车站、路标、栅栏以及车辆，取而代之的是一整套蒸汽铁路系统。在过去，设计不合理的工厂以及四处冒烟的令人讨厌的装置半个世纪以来一直妨碍着人们的生活。"
"Then also there was a great harvest of fences, notice boards, hoardings, ugly sheds, all the corrugated iron in the world, and everything that was smeared with tar, all our gas works and petroleum stores, all our horse vehicles and vans and lorries had to be erased....","还有大量的栅栏、布告牌、招贴版、丑陋的车棚、所有皱巴巴的铁制品，以及凡是涂了柏油的东西和所有的天然气厂和汽油厂，所有的马车和火车都得清除……"
"But I have said enough now perhaps to give some idea of the bulk and quality of our great bonfires, our burnings up, our meltings down, our toil of sheer wreckage, over and above the constructive effort, in those early years.","为了让大家明白早些年我们的篝火的数量，燃烧的状况，熔化的东西以及收拾残局的辛劳，或许我已经说得够多了。"
"But these were the coarse material bases of the Phoenix fires of the world.","但这些都是世界上的凤凰之火所需的基本的粗糙的材料。"
"These were but the outward and visible signs of the innumerable claims, rights, adhesions, debts, bills, deeds, and charters that were cast upon the fires; a vast accumulation of insignia and uniforms neither curious enough nor beautiful enough to preserve, went to swell the blaze, and all (saving a few truly glorious trophies and memories) of our symbols, our apparatus and material of war.","这些只不过是那些扔进火堆里的不计其数的要求、权利、坚持、债券、账单以及图表所看得见的外在的形式。我们还烧掉了大量的徽章和制服，它们既不新奇也不漂亮，不值得保存，所有那些与战争有关的象征物、装置以及材料（保留了少数令人感到光荣战利品和纪念品）都被烧掉了。"
"Then innumerable triumphs of our old, bastard, half-commercial, fine-art were presently condemned, great oil paintings, done to please the half-educated middle-class, glared for a moment and were gone, Academy marbles crumbled to useful lime, a gross multitude of silly statuettes and decorative crockery, and hangings, and embroideries, and bad music, and musical instruments shared this fate.","数不清的旧时战利品，假冒的、半商业化的或上好的艺术品被没收了，那些为了取悦文化程度不高的中产阶级而制作的巨幅油画只是荣耀一时，然后也被弄走了。学校里的大理石被粉碎成了有用的石灰，一大堆傻里傻气的雕塑、装饰用的陶器、悬挂装饰物、刺绣品以及粗制滥造的音乐和乐器也难逃同样的命运。"
"And books, countless books, too, and bales of newspapers went also to these pyres.","还有那些书，数不清的书以及大包的报纸也被扔进柴堆里，拿去当燃料。"
"From the private houses in Swathinglea alone—which I had deemed, perhaps not unjustly, altogether illiterate—we gathered a whole dust-cart full of cheap ill-printed editions of the minor English classics—for the most part very dull stuff indeed and still clean—and about a truckload of thumbed and dog-eared penny fiction, watery base stuff, the dropsy of our nation’s mind....","仅仅从斯沃星利私人住宅里——我认为那些人完全是目不识丁（也许并非不公正）——我们收集了满满一车便宜的、印刷低劣的各种版本的次要的英国经典作品（因为大多数书确实枯燥无味，还十分干净），还有一卡车被翻过的已经折皱了的便宜小说和一些潮湿的拙劣的东西，就像是我们国民那水肿的头脑……"
"And it seemed to me that when we gathered those books and papers together, we gathered together something more than print and paper, we gathered warped and crippled ideas and contagious base suggestions, the formulae of dull tolerances and stupid impatiences, the mean defensive ingenuities of sluggish habits of thinking and timid and indolent evasions.","在我看来，当我们把那些书本和报纸收到一块儿时，我们收集的不仅仅是印刷品和纸张，而是一些扭曲的、片面的观点和蔓延的卑劣的建议，以及乏味的容忍和愚蠢的躁动，还有懒惰的思维习惯、胆小和逃避责任等坏毛病。"
"There was more than a touch of malignant satisfaction for me in helping gather it all together.","对我来说，把这些东西收集起来后，我感到满意，甚至有些幸灾乐祸。"
"I was so busy, I say, with my share in this dustman’s work that I did not notice, as I should otherwise have done, the little indications of change in my mother’s state.","哎我一直忙于清洁工作，以至于没有注意到（我本该注意到的）母亲病情的细微变化。"
"Indeed, I thought her a little stronger; she was slightly flushed, slightly more talkative....","事实上，我还觉得她身体比以前跟更强壮了一点儿。她的脸有些发红，话也多了一点儿……"
"On Beltane Eve, and our Lowchester rummage being finished, I went along the valley to the far end of Swathinglea to help sort the stock of the detached group of potbanks there—their chief output had been mantel ornaments in imitation of marble, and there was very little sorting, I found, to be done—and there it was nurse Anna found me at last by telephone, and told me my mother had died in the morning suddenly and very shortly after my departure.","燃烧节前夕，罗切斯特的检查工作结束了，我沿着山谷到斯沃星利得最边远处去帮着给库存的东西分类。那里的主要产品是模仿大理石做的壁炉饰品，我发现没有什么需要分类的。保姆安娜终于通过电话找到了我，告诉我说母亲在早晨我离开后不久突然离世。"
"For a while I did not seem to believe it; this obviously imminent event stunned me when it came, as though I had never had an anticipatory moment.","有一会儿我简直不相信这是事实。很明显这件事迟早会发生，可是当它真正来临的时候，我却目瞪口呆，仿佛我从未想过这一刻会到来一样。"
"For a while I went on working, and then almost apathetically, in a mood of half-reluctant curiosity, I started for Lowchester.","我继续干活，过了好一阵子才怀着沉重的心情，几乎是麻木地前往罗切斯特。"
"When I got there the last offices were over, and I was shown my old mother’s peaceful white face, very still, but a little cold and stern to me, a little unfamiliar, lying among white flowers.","当我到达那儿时，所有的事情都已安排妥当。他们带我看了躺在白花丛中母亲的遗体，她那张安详苍白的脸庞非常平静，可我却觉得有点儿冷漠、严厉和陌生。"
"I went in alone to her, into that quiet room, and stood for a long time by her bedside.","我独自一人走进去看她，走进那间安静的屋子，在她床边站了好长时间。"
"I sat down then and thought....","然后坐下来，陷入沉思……"
"Then at last, strangely hushed, and with the deeps of my loneliness opening beneath me, I came out of that room and down into the world again, a bright-eyed, active world, very noisy, happy, and busy with its last preparations for the mighty cremation of past and superseded things.","最后，我竟然出奇地平静下来，内心感到深深的孤寂。我走出房间，重新来到这个闪亮喧嚣的世界，人们兴高采烈，正忙着为除旧迎新做最后的准备。"
"Section 2","第二节"
"I remember that first Beltane festival as the most terribly lonely night in my life.","我记得，第一个燃烧节是我一生中最孤独的夜晚。"
"It stands in my mind in fragments, fragments of intense feeling with forgotten gaps between.","我脑海里残留着一些片段，强烈感到有些事情被我遗忘了。"
"I recall very distinctly being upon the great staircase of Lowchester House (though I don’t remember getting there from the room in which my mother lay), and how upon the landing I met Anna ascending as I came down.","我清楚地记得罗切斯特大宅的楼梯（虽然我不记得是如何从母亲所躺的房间走到那里的），还记得我下楼时碰到正上楼的安娜。"
"She had but just heard of my return, and she was hurrying upstairs to me.","她刚听说我回来了，就急匆匆上楼来见我。"
"She stopped and so did I, and we stood and clasped hands, and she scrutinized my face in the way women sometimes do.","她停下了脚步，我也是，我们站在那里，紧紧握住对方的手，她用女性惯用的方式打量着我的脸。"
"So we remained for a second or so.","因此我们在那里停留了几秒。"
"I could say nothing to her at all, but I could feel the wave of her emotion.","我对她什么也说不出来，可是我能察觉到她情绪的波动。"
"I halted, answered the earnest pressure of her hand, relinquished it, and after a queer second of hesitation went on down, returning to my own preoccupations.","我停在那里，回应着她紧握的手，然后又放开，没来由地犹豫了几秒后继续朝楼下走去，重新想着自己的心事。"
"It did not occur to me at all then to ask myself what she might be thinking or feeling.","我根本就没想到要问自己，当时她在想什么，又是什么样的感觉。"
"I remember the corridor full of mellow evening light, and how I went mechanically some paces toward the dining-room.","我记得夜幕下的走廊里洒满了柔和的灯光，我机械地朝着餐厅走去。"
"Then at the sight of the little tables, and a gusty outburst of talking voices as some one in front of me swung the door open and to, I remembered that I did not want to eat....","接着我看到了一些小桌子，当我前面的人把门打开后我听到许多人大声说着话，我记得当时我根本不想吃饭……"
"After that comes an impression of myself walking across the open grass in front of the house, and the purpose I had of getting alone upon the moors, and how somebody passing me said something about a hat.","在我的印象里，后来我步行穿过了屋前的草坪，我记得独自一人到荒野去的目的，记得有人从我身边经过，对我说了些有关帽子的事情。"
"I had come out without my hat.","我之前走出来的时候没戴帽子。"
"A fragment of thought has linked itself with an effect of long shadows upon turf golden with the light of the sinking sun.","我隐约记得，夕阳的余晖照在草坪上，留下金色的长长的影子。"
"The world was singularly empty, I thought, without either Nettie or my mother.","我想，少了妮蒂和母亲，这个世界是异乎寻常的空虚。"
"There wasn’t any sense in it any more.","再也没有任何意义。"
"Nettie was already back in my mind then....","然后我又想起妮蒂……"
"Then I am out on the moors.","我来到荒原。"
"I avoided the crests where the bonfires were being piled, and sought the lonely places....","我避开堆着篝火的山顶，想找僻静的地方……"
"I remember very clearly sitting on a gate beyond the park, in a fold just below the crest, that hid the Beacon Hill bonfire and its crowd, and I was looking at and admiring the sunset.","我记得很清楚，当时我坐在公园那边的大门附近。那个公园坐落在山顶下的峰回路转处，从那里看不到比肯山上的篝火，看不到人群，而我则遥望着、欣赏着日落。"
"The golden earth and sky seemed like a little bubble that floated in the globe of human futility....","金黄色的大地和天空就像是漂浮在人类无为的地球上的泡影……"
"Then in the twilight I walked along an unknown, bat-haunted road between high hedges.","黄昏时分，我走上一条不知名的小路，路上到处飞着蝙蝠，两旁是高高的篱笆。"
"I did not sleep under a roof that night.","那一晚我没有在屋内睡觉。"
"But I hungered and ate.","但是我觉得饿了，便吃了些东西。"
"I ate near midnight at a little inn over toward Birmingham, and miles away from my home.","接近午夜时分，我在通往伯明翰的一家小店里吃了点儿东西，那里离我家有数英里远。"
"Instinctively I had avoided the crests where the bonfire crowds gathered, but here there were many people, and I had to share a table with a man who had some useless mortgage deeds to burn.","我本能地避开了篝火堆积的山顶，不过这里人很多，我不得不和另一个人共用一张桌子，他有一些没用的抵押契据要烧毁。"
"I talked to him about them—but my soul stood at a great distance behind my lips....","我和他谈论着那些单据——不过说话时我却心不在焉……"
"Soon each hilltop bore a little tulip-shaped flame flower.","不久，每个山顶都出现一朵小小的郁金香形状的火花。"
"Little black figures clustered round and dotted the base of its petals, and as for the rest of the multitude abroad, the kindly night swallowed them up.","人们小小的黑影聚集在周围，点缀着火花的花瓣，至于剩下的广袤的地方则笼罩在温柔的夜色之中。"
"By leaving the roads and clear paths and wandering in the fields I contrived to keep alone, though the confused noise of voices and the roaring and crackling of great fires was always near me.","离开小路去田间散步时，我尽量独自一人，尽管耳边总是萦绕着人们的喧嚣声和篝火的劈啪声。"
"I wandered into a lonely meadow, and presently in a hollow of deep shadows I lay down to stare at the stars.","我走到一块偏僻的草地上，然后找了一块深陷的洼地躺了下去，盯着天上的星星看。"
"I lay hidden in the darkness, and ever and again the sough and uproar of the Beltane fires that were burning up the sere follies of a vanished age, and the shouting of the people passing through the fires and praying to be delivered from the prison of themselves, reached my ears....","我躲在黑暗之中，耳边不时传来嗖嗖的风声和燃烧节篝火劈啪作响的声音——篝火正燃烧着一个消失时代的残留物——还听到人们经过火堆时的谈笑声，他们祈祷远离被禁锢的地方……"
"And I thought of my mother, and then of my new loneliness and the hunger of my heart for Nettie.","我想起了母亲，想起了新添的孤寂以及内心对妮蒂的渴望。"
"I thought of many things that night, but chiefly of the overflowing personal love and tenderness that had come to me in the wake of the Change, of the greater need, the unsatisfied need in which I stood, for this one person who could fulfil all my desires.","那天晚上，我想了许多，不过主要是巨变之后心里满满的爱恋和柔情，以及强烈的未得到满足的需求，我需要她，她能满足我所有的渴望。"
"So long as my mother had lived, she had in a measure held my heart, given me a food these emotions could live upon, and mitigated that emptiness of spirit, but now suddenly that one possible comfort had left me.","只要我母亲还活着，她多多少少会占据我的心，能给我精神支柱，减轻我内心的空虚，然而现在，那种可能的慰藉突然离我而去。"
"There had been many at the season of the Change who had thought that this great enlargement of mankind would abolish personal love; but indeed it had only made it finer, fuller, more vitally necessary.","巨变发生的那个时代，许多人认为，人类巨大的扩张会消除人与人之间的爱，可事实上它使爱变得更美好，更充实，更有必要。"
"They had thought that, seeing men now were all full of the joyful passion to make and do, and glad and loving and of willing service to all their fellows, there would be no need of the one intimate trusting communion that had been the finest thing of the former life.","看到人们充满快乐和激情，热爱自己的同伴，愿意为同伴服务，他们曾认为不再需要那种亲密无间、相互信任的交流了，而那种交流曾是以前生活里最美好的事情。"
"And indeed, so far as this was a matter of advantage and the struggle for existence, they were right.","实际上，要说这是一个利益问题，是一个为生存而奋斗的问题，他们是正确的。"
"But so far as it was a matter of the spirit and the fine perceptions of life, it was altogether wrong.","不过，要说这是个精神问题，是个追求美好生活的问题，他们的想法就完全错了。"
"We had indeed not eliminated personal love, we had but stripped it of its base wrappings, of its pride, its suspicions, its mercenary and competitive elements, until at last it stood up in our minds stark, shining and invincible.","事实上，我们并没有消除人与人之间的爱，只不过是剥除了它那卑劣的包装、它的骄傲、猜疑和一些唯利是图、钩心斗角的因素，直到最后它在我们的脑海里时鲜明突出，闪闪放光，不可战胜。"
"Through all the fine, divaricating ways of the new life, it grew ever more evident, there were for every one certain persons, mysteriously and indescribably in the key of one’s self, whose mere presence gave pleasure, whose mere existence was interest, whose idiosyncrasy blended with accident to make a completing and predominant harmony for their predestined lovers.","通过所有那些美好的、多姿多彩的新的生活方式来看，事情越来越明显，每个人心中都有一些特定的人，他们的出现会带来快乐，他们的存在就是一种乐趣，对他们的情人来说，他们独特的气质与特定的场合结合在一起，总能营造出完美的和谐气氛，这是很神秘的，难以描述。"
"They were the essential thing in life.","他们是生命里必不可少的东西。"
"Without them the fine brave show of the rejuvenated world was a caparisoned steed without a rider, a bowl without a flower, a theater without a play....","没有他们，这个复苏后的世界里上演的华丽的展示就如同一匹盛装装扮却没有骑士的战马，如同没有鲜花的花瓶，没有表演的剧场……"
"And to me that night of Beltane, it was as clear as white flames that Nettie, and Nettie alone, roused those harmonies in me.","对我来说，燃烧节的那个夜晚，明显是妮蒂（就只有妮蒂）唤起了我心中的平和。"
"And she had gone!","而她已经走了。"
"I had sent her from me; I knew not whither she had gone.","是我打发她走的，但我却不知道她去了哪里。"
"I had in my first virtuous foolishness cut her out of my life for ever!","我真是高尚得愚蠢，竟让她永远走出了我的生活！"
"So I saw it then, and I lay unseen in the darkness and called upon Nettie, and wept for her, lay upon my face and wept for her, while the glad people went to and fro, and the smoke streamed thick across the distant stars, and the red reflections, the shadows and the fluctuating glares, danced over the face of the world.","那时我又想起这些，我躺在黑夜之中，没人看见。我想起了妮蒂，泪流满面，而过往的人群却欢乐无比。浓浓的烟雾袅袅升起，穿过遥远的星空，火苗反射出红色的光芒，摇曳不定，在新世界里翩翩起舞。"
"No!","不！"
"the Change had freed us from our baser passions indeed, from habitual and mechanical concupiscence and mean issues and coarse imaginings, but from the passions of love it had not freed us.","巨变确实使我们摆脱了不道德的情欲，摆脱了惯常机械的色欲以及低劣的事情和粗野的想象，不过它没有将我们从情爱中解放出来。"
"It had but brought the lord of life, Eros, to his own.","它只是带来了生命之主，厄洛斯。"
"All through the long sorrow of that night I, who had rejected him, confessed his sway with tears and inappeasable regrets....","我曾经很排斥他，经过那晚漫长的悲痛，我哭泣着向他忏悔了一番，带着深深的悔恨……"
"I cannot give the remotest guess of when I rose up, nor of my tortuous wanderings in the valleys between the midnight fires, nor how I evaded the laughing and rejoicing multitudes who went streaming home between three and four, to resume their lives, swept and garnished, stripped and clean.","我不记得自己是什么时候起来的，也想不起半夜时曾在山谷绕着火堆徘徊，更不知道我是如何躲开了欢笑喧闹的人群。他们三五成群地涌回家去，打扫清洁，装饰房屋，继续各自的生活。"
"But at dawn, when the ashes of the world’s gladness were ceasing to glow—it was a bleak dawn that made me shiver in my thin summer clothes—I came across a field to a little copse full of dim blue hyacinths.","但是黎明时分（那是一个寒冷刺骨的黎明，身着夏天单薄的衣服，我不禁瑟瑟发抖），当世界不再喧嚣，人们的喜悦之情渐渐褪去时，我穿过一片田地，来到一个长满浅蓝色风信子的灌木丛里。"
"A queer sense of familiarity arrested my steps, and I stood puzzled.","一种奇怪的熟悉感让我停下脚步，我站在那里，迷惑不解。"
"Then I was moved to go a dozen paces from the path, and at once a singularly misshapen tree hitched itself into a notch in my memory.","不知不觉朝小路旁走出几步，脑海里立刻浮现出一棵奇形怪状、向着峡谷生长的大树。"
"This was the place!","这就是那个地方！"
"Here I had stood, there I had placed my old kite, and shot with my revolver, learning to use it, against the day when I should encounter Verrall.","我曾经就站在这里，把旧风筝放在了那边，学着使用左轮手枪射击，正是在那天我遇见了维罗尔。"
"Kite and revolver had gone now, and all my hot and narrow past, its last vestiges had shriveled and vanished in the whirling gusts of the Beltane fires.","如今风筝和手枪都不见了，我那狂热而偏执的过去也在席卷燃烧节火堆的强风中消失殆尽，不留一点儿痕迹。"
"So I walked through a world of gray ashes at last, back to the great house in which the dead, deserted image of my dear lost mother lay.","于是最终我还是踏着一片灰烬，回到了那间大房子，那里挂着我亲爱的已经去世的母亲孤单的照片。"
"Section 3","第三节"
"I came back to Lowchester House very tired, very wretched; exhausted by my fruitless longing for Nettie.","回到罗切斯特大宅时，我身心疲倦，苦苦思念妮蒂却毫无结果，这让我筋疲力尽。"
"I had no thought of what lay before me.","我不知道摆在我面前的是什么。"
"A miserable attraction drew me into the great house to look again on the stillness that had been my mother’s face, and as I came into that room, Anna, who had been sitting by the open window, rose to meet me.","悲从中来，我再一次走进这座大宅，看着母亲那已经僵硬的面容。安娜之前一直坐在打开的窗户前，我进屋时，她便起身来迎接我。"
"She had the air of one who waits.","她似乎是在等我。"
"She, too, was pale with watching; all night she had watched between the dead within and the Beltane fires abroad, and longed for my coming.","她看上去也是脸色苍白，整晚她就在屋内的死人和屋外燃烧节的篝火之间张望，急切地盼我归来。"
"I stood mute between her and the bedside....","站在她和床铺之间，我默不作声……"
"“Willie,” she whispered, and eyes and body seemed incarnate pity.","“威利，”她轻声唤我，眼睛和姿态似乎都流露着同情。"
"An unseen presence drew us together.","一种无形的力量将我们联系在一起。"
"My mother’s face became resolute, commanding.","母亲脸上的表情变得坚定、严厉。"
"I turned to Anna as a child may turn to its nurse.","我转向安娜，就像一个小孩转向自己的保姆。"
"I put my hands about her strong shoulders, she folded me to her, and my heart gave way.","我把手搭在她强壮的肩膀上，她将我拉进怀里，我的心都快要跳出来了。"
"I buried my face in her breast and clung to her weakly, and burst into a passion of weeping....","我无力地抓着她，把脸埋在她的胸前，失声痛哭起来……"
"She held me with hungry arms.","安娜用力地抱着我。"
"She whispered to me, “There, there!”","她轻声对我说：“好了，好了！”"
"as one whispers comfort to a child....","像是在轻声安慰一个孩子似的……"
"Suddenly she was kissing me.","忽然之间她开始吻我。"
"She kissed me with a hungry intensity of passion, on my cheeks, on my lips.","她狂热地吻着我的脸颊和嘴唇。"
"She kissed me on my lips with lips that were salt with tears.","她的唇覆在我的唇上，上面沾满了咸咸的泪水。"
"And I returned her kisses....","我回应着她的亲吻……"
"Then abruptly we desisted and stood apart—looking at one another.","突然我们停了下来，迅速分开，相互对望着。"
"Section 4","第四节"
"It seems to me as if the intense memory of Nettie vanished utterly out of my mind at the touch of Anna’s lips.","在碰触到安娜嘴唇的那一瞬间，我对妮蒂深深的思念似乎一下子消失得无影无踪。"
"I loved Anna.","我爱上了安娜。"
"We went to the council of our group—commune it was then called—and she was given me in marriage, and within a year she had borne me a son.","我们一同去理事会（当时叫公社）登记结婚，之后不到一年她就给我生了个儿子。"
"We saw much of one another, and talked ourselves very close together.","我们之间的感情甚好，常在一起谈心。"
"My faithful friend she became and has been always, and for a time we were passionate lovers.","她成了我永远忠实的朋友，很长一段时间，我们爱得轰轰烈烈。"
"Always she has loved me and kept my soul full of tender gratitude and love for her; always when we met our hands and eyes clasped in friendly greeting, all through our lives from that hour we have been each other’s secure help and refuge, each other’s ungrudging fastness of help and sweetly frank and open speech....","她一直爱着我，让我心中对她充满了满满的爱意和感激之情。每当我们相见，我们都紧握双手，四目相望，表达亲切的问候。从我们情愿为对方挡风遮雨，彼此坦诚相待的那一刻起，这种方式就一直贯穿着我们的生活……"
"And after a little while my love and desire for Nettie returned as though it had never faded away.","可是没过多久，我对妮蒂的爱恋和渴望又悄然回升，好像从来都没有消失过。"
"No one will have a difficulty now in understanding how that could be, but in the evil days of the world malaria, that would have been held to be the most impossible thing.","人们现在不难理解事情怎么会是那样，除非是在过去那个罪恶的年代里，否则那简直是太匪夷所思了。"
"I should have had to crush that second love out of my thoughts, to have kept it secret from Anna, to have lied about it to all the world.","我本应该抑制住内心的这种感情，不让安娜知道，对全世界都不说出事情的真相。"
"The old-world theory was there was only one love—we who float upon a sea of love find that hard to understand.","传统的观点认为只有一种爱，而我们这些涉足爱河的人对此感到十分不解。"
"The whole nature of a man was supposed to go out to the one girl or woman who possessed him, her whole nature to go out to him.","人们认为一个男人只能属于那个拥有他的女孩儿或女人，而她也只属于他。"
"Nothing was left over—it was a discreditable thing to have any overplus at all.","没有什么例外的情况，超越了这一点就会被认为是令人难以置信的事情。"
"They formed a secret secluded system of two, two and such children as she bore him.","他们制定了一种制度，用来约束夫妻二人及其所生的孩子。"
"All other women he was held bound to find no beauty in, no sweetness, no interest; and she likewise, in no other man.","他不能觉得其他女人漂亮、甜美，也不能对她们产生任何兴趣。同样，她也不能倾心于其他男人。"
"The old-time men and women went apart in couples, into defensive little houses, like beasts into little pits, and in these “homes” they sat down purposing to love, but really coming very soon to jealous watching of this extravagant mutual proprietorship.","在过去，男人和女人成双成对地分开，住进有防御性的小房子里，就像野兽住进小洞里。在这些所谓的“家”里，他们坐下来谈情说爱，但事实上他们很快就开始反思彼此间的这种过度占有。"
"All freshness passed very speedily out of their love, out of their conversation, all pride out of their common life.","他们的感情急剧降温，谈话也失去了新鲜感，所有的自豪也随着生活的平凡而消失。"
"To permit each other freedom was blank dishonor.","允许对方自由不再是耻辱。"
"That I and Anna should love, and after our love-journey together, go about our separate lives and dine at the public tables, until the advent of her motherhood, would have seemed a terrible strain upon our unmitigable loyalty.","我和安娜应该相爱，只是在蜜月旅行之后，我们就各过各的，在公用餐桌上用餐，直到她做了母亲，这似乎是为我们彼此间的忠诚绷上了一根紧弦。"
"And that I should have it in me to go on loving Nettie—who loved in different manner both Verrall and me—would have outraged the very quintessence of the old convention.","我应该还爱着妮蒂（她也以不同的方式同时爱着维罗尔和我），这种情况违背了传统习俗的核心理念。"
"In the old days love was a cruel proprietary thing.","以前，爱情就是残酷的占有。"
"But now Anna could let Nettie live in the world of my mind, as freely as a rose will suffer the presence of white lilies.","可是如今，安娜允许妮蒂自由地活在我的心里，就像玫瑰容忍百合的出现一样。"
"If I could hear notes that were not in her compass, she was glad, because she loved me, that I should listen to other music than hers.","如果我听些她不喜欢的乐曲，她不会不高兴，因为她爱我，认为我应该听一些其他音乐。"
"And she, too, could see the beauty of Nettie.","而她，同样能看到妮蒂的美丽。"
"Life is so rich and generous now, giving friendship, and a thousand tender interests and helps and comforts, that no one stints another of the full realization of all possibilities of beauty.","现在的生活丰富多彩，让人与人之间建立友谊，为他们提供千姿百态的兴趣、无数的帮助和慰藉，这样就没有人会限制其他人充分展现自己的美丽。"
"For me from the beginning Nettie was the figure of beauty, the shape and color of the divine principle that lights the world.","在我心里，妮蒂从一开始就是美的化身，有着神灵的身材和肤色，照亮了全世界。"
"For every one there are certain types, certain faces and forms, gestures, voices and intonations that have that inexplicable unanalyzable quality.","对每个人而言，总有某些人，某些脸庞、身形、姿态、声音和性格有着难以解释也无法分析的特质。"
"These come through the crowd of kindly friendly fellow-men and women—one’s own.","这些人就来自那些友好善良的同伴之中——也许自己也是其中之一。"
"These touch one mysteriously, stir deeps that must otherwise slumber, pierce and interpret the world.","他们让人觉得神秘，引人深思，使人能看穿并解读这个世界。"
"To refuse this interpretation is to refuse the sun, to darken and deaden all life....","拒绝这种解读就是拒绝太阳，就是让生活黯淡消亡……"
"I loved Nettie, I loved all who were like her, in the measure that they were like her, in voice, or eyes, or form, or smile.","我爱妮蒂，我爱所有与她相像的女孩，爱她们与她那相似的声音、眼睛、身形和笑容。"
"And between my wife and me there was no bitterness that the great goddess, the life-giver, Aphrodite, Queen of the living Seas, came to my imagination so.","而我和妻子也生活幸福，从来没有想到过伟大的女神以及造物主阿芙罗蒂，那富含生命的海洋女王。"
"It qualified our mutual love not at all, since now in our changed world love is unstinted; it is a golden net about our globe that nets all humanity together.","它并没有影响我们之间的爱情，因为在如今这个发生变革的世界里，爱是无拘无束的。它就像一张金色的大网，环绕整个世界，将所有人都联系在一起。"
"I thought of Nettie much, and always movingly beautiful things restored me to her, all fine music, all pure deep color, all tender and solemn things.","我常常想起妮蒂，所有美好的事物，包括动听的音乐，纯洁的色彩以及肃穆柔美的事物，都会勾起我对她的思念。"
"The stars were hers, and the mystery of moonlight; the sun she wore in her hair, powdered finely, beaten into gleams and threads of sunlight in the wisps and strands of her hair....","满天繁星，还有那神秘的月光都属于她。太阳照在她的头发上，光线穿过她的发丝……"
"Then suddenly one day a letter came to me from her, in her unaltered clear handwriting, but in a new language of expression, telling me many things.","突然有一天，她给我寄来一封信，字迹依然那么清秀，丝毫未变，只是措辞有些不同，她告诉我很多事情。"
"She had learnt of my mother’s death, and the thought of me had grown so strong as to pierce the silence I had imposed on her.","她得知了我母亲去世的消息，对我的思念与日俱增，于是只好破坏了我强迫她接受的约定。"
"We wrote to one another—like common friends with a certain restraint between us at first, and with a great longing to see her once more arising in my heart.","我们开始书信来往，起初都克制自己，就像普通朋友一样，后来我的心里便升起一股强烈的愿望，想要见她。"
"For a time I left that hunger unexpressed, and then I was moved to tell it to her.","我把这个愿望在心里埋藏了一段时间，后来忍不住便告诉了她。"
"And so on New Year’s Day in the Year Four, she came to Lowchester and me.","就这样，在第四年的元旦那天，她来到了罗切斯特，来到了我身边。"
"How I remember that coming, across the gulf of fifty years!","纵使期间有50年的鸿沟，我依然记得她来看我的情景。"
"I went out across the park to meet her, so that we should meet alone.","我穿过公园去见她，为的是我们能单独相见。"
"The windless morning was clear and cold, the ground new carpeted with snow, and all the trees motionless lace and glitter of frosty crystals.","那天早上没有风，天气晴朗，有些寒冷，地上又覆盖了一层白雪，所有的树木都一动不动，枝丫上落满了霜花，闪闪发亮，水晶一般。"
"The rising sun had touched the white with a spirit of gold, and my heart beat and sang within me.","徐徐升起的太阳给银白色的大地披上了一层金色，我的心怦怦直跳，无比兴奋。"
"I remember now the snowy shoulder of the down, sunlit against the bright blue sky.","现在我都还记得地上白雪皑皑，蔚蓝的天空上艳阳高照。"
"And presently I saw the woman I loved coming through the white still trees....","不大一会儿，我就看见自己心爱的女人穿过白雪覆盖的静谧的树林朝我走来……"
"I had made a goddess of Nettie, and behold she was a fellow-creature!","我曾把妮蒂看作女神，而现在却觉得她就是我的同伴。"
"She came, warm-wrapped and tremulous, to me, with the tender promise of tears in her eyes, with her hands outstretched and that dear smile quivering upon her lips.","她穿得很暖和却还发着抖，朝我走过来时，眼里闪着泪花。她伸出双手，颤抖的双唇上露出一丝笑容。"
"She stepped out of the dream I had made of her, a thing of needs and regrets and human kindliness.","她从我为她编织的梦里走了出来。"
"Her hands as I took them were a little cold.","她的手在被我握住的那一刻时是冰凉的。"
"The goddess shone through her indeed, glowed in all her body, she was a worshipful temple of love for me—yes.","女神的光芒的确在她体内熠熠生辉，对我来说，她就是令人为之倾慕的爱神——真的。"
"But I could feel, like a thing new discovered, the texture and sinews of her living, her dear personal and mortal hands....","但是我可以感觉到，就像是才发现这点一样，感觉到她生命的本质与力量，感觉到她可爱的双手……"

"The Epilogue","后记"
"The Window of the Tower","塔楼之窗"
"This was as much as this pleasant-looking, gray-haired man had written.","这篇小说是由那位面容和蔼、头发花白的男士所创作的。"
"I had been lost in his story throughout the earlier portions of it, forgetful of the writer and his gracious room, and the high tower in which he was sitting.","早在故事一开头，我就完全沉浸其中，忘记了作者，忘记了他那雅致的房间，也忘记了他所在的那座高高的塔楼。"
"But gradually, as I drew near the end, the sense of strangeness returned to me.","但是当故事接近尾声时，我逐渐找回了那种陌生的感觉。"
"It was more and more evident to me that this was a different humanity from any I had known, unreal, having different customs, different beliefs, different interpretations, different emotions.","我越来越明显地觉得，这是一种不同于以往我所知道的任何人道主义，它是不真实的，有着不同的风俗，不同的信仰，不同的阐释和不同的情感。"
"It was no mere change in conditions and institutions the comet had wrought.","它不仅仅只是彗星所引起的条件和习俗方面的变化。"
"It had made a change of heart and mind.","心灵和思想都有所改变。"
"In a manner it had dehumanized the world, robbed it of its spites, its little intense jealousies, its inconsistencies, its humor.","不妨说，它使世界失去了人性，消除了人与人之间的怨恨，除去了强烈的妒意，解决了人们意见分歧的问题，还使他们丢失了幽默。"
"At the end, and particularly after the death of his mother, I felt his story had slipped away from my sympathies altogether.","最后，尤其是在他母亲去世后，我觉得他的遭遇完全失去了我的同情。"
"Those Beltane fires had burnt something in him that worked living still and unsubdued in me, that rebelled in particular at that return of Nettie.","“燃烧节”的篝火烧掉了他内心没有消逝的东西，也烧掉了我心里还没有接受的东西，特别是在妮蒂回来后，我更是觉得反感。"
"I became a little inattentive.","我变得有点儿心不在焉。"
"I no longer felt with him, nor gathered a sense of complete understanding from his phrases.","我不再与他感同身受，也不能完全理解他字里行间的含义。"
"His Lord Eros indeed!","就是他的爱神厄洛斯！"
"He and these transfigured people—they were beautiful and noble people, like the people one sees in great pictures, like the gods of noble sculpture, but they had no nearer fellowship than these to men.","他和那些被美化了的人们——他们漂亮而高贵，就像巨幅画像里看到的人一样，也像神像一样尊贵，不过和那些人相比，他们与现实中人的距离更遥远。"
"As the change was realized, with every stage of realization the gulf widened and it was harder to follow his words.","当我意识到这一变化后，对他话语的理解就随着每一次认识的加深变得更加困难。"

"“And had Nettie no other lovers?”","“妮蒂没有其他恋人吗？”"
"“A beautiful woman like that!","“像那样漂亮的女人怎么会没有呢？"
"I know not how many loved beauty in her, nor what she found in others.","我不知道有多少人爱上的是她的美貌，也不知道她在其他人身上看到了什么。"
"But we four from that time were very close, you understand, we were friends, helpers, personal lovers in a world of lovers.”","可我们四个人从那时起就开始很亲密，你知道的，我们是朋友，彼此相爱，又有各自的恋人，常常互相帮助。”"
"“Four?”","“四个人？”"
"“There was Verrall.”","“还有维罗尔。”"
"Then suddenly it came to me that the thoughts that stirred in my mind were sinister and base, that the queer suspicions, the coarseness and coarse jealousies of my old world were over and done for these more finely living souls.","我忽然意识到，我脑海里的想法既邪恶又卑鄙，也意识到我对旧世界古怪的猜疑和粗俗的嫉妒因这些活着的人而消失不见。"
"“You made,” I said, trying to be liberal minded, “a home together.”","“你们，”我试着放开心胸说道，“共同营建了一个家。”"
"“A home!”","“一个家！”"
"He looked at me, and, I know not why, I glanced down at my feet.","他看着我，不知道为什么，我却低头看着自己的双脚。"
"What a clumsy, ill-made thing a boot is, and how hard and colorless seemed my clothing!","这双靴子做工很差，看起来如此笨重！我的衣服也多么老气，多么暗淡无光！"
"How harshly I stood out amidst these fine, perfected things.","站在这些精致完美的事物中间，我真是相形见绌。"
"I had a moment of rebellious detestation.","一时间，我产生了一种反感和厌恶。"
"I wanted to get out of all this.","我想逃离这个地方。"
"After all, it wasn’t my style.","可毕竟，这不是我的作风。"

"“I forgot,” he said.","“我忘记了，”他说，"
"“You are pretending the old world is still going on.","“你假设旧社会还存在着。"
"A home!”","还有一个家！”"
"He put out his hand, and quite noiselessly the great window widened down to us, and the splendid nearer prospect of that dreamland city was before me.","他伸出手去，大窗户被轻轻推开了，那座梦幻之城的旖旎风光便展现在我眼前。"
"There for one clear moment I saw it; its galleries and open spaces, its trees of golden fruit and crystal waters, its music and rejoicing, love and beauty without ceasing flowing through its varied and intricate streets.","我看了好大一会儿，城市里的长廊、广阔的天地、结着金色果实的树林、清澈透明的流水、优美动听的音乐和那欢快的情欲爱恋都在这纷繁交错的街道里奔流不息。"
"And the nearer people I saw now directly and plainly, and no longer in the distorted mirror that hung overhead.","这时我可以直接、清晰地看到附近的人，不再通过挂在头上的镜子看见他们扭曲的身形。"
"They really did not justify my suspicions, and yet—!","他们确实没有证实我的猜疑是对的，仍然没有！"
"They were such people as one sees on earth—save that they were changed.","他们就跟我们在地球上看到的人一样——只是他们已经变了。"
"How can I express that change?","我怎样才能描述这个变化呢？"
"As a woman is changed in the eyes of her lover, as a woman is changed by the love of a lover.","就像一个女人在她爱人眼里发生的变化，就像一个女人被她恋人的爱所改变了一样。"
"They were exalted....","他们变得高贵了……"
"I stood up beside him and looked out.","我从他身边站起来，向外望去。"
"I was a little flushed, my ears a little reddened, by the inconvenience of my curiosities, and by my uneasy sense of profound moral differences.","我的好奇心给我带来了些许的不便，加上意识到我们巨大的道德差异所引起的不安，让我稍稍有点儿脸红，耳朵也有些发烫。"
"He was taller than I....","他要比我高大一些……"
"“This is our home,” he said smiling, and with thoughtful eyes on me.","“这就是我们的家。”他用深邃的眼睛望着我，微笑着说道。"
