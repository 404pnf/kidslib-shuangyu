"警讯","The Warning"
"“我在想——”我开口说道。","“I am inclined to think——” said I."
"“接着想吧，”歇洛克· 福尔摩斯不胜其烦地接口说道。","“I should do so,” Sherlock Holmes remarked impatiently."
"我自认拥有全世界数一数二的耐性，可我必须承认，他这句藏针带刺的插话让我相当着恼。","I believe that I am one of the most longsuffering of mortals; but I’ ll admit that I was annoyed at the sardonic interruption."
"“说实在的，福尔摩斯，”我义正词严地说道，“有些时候，你可真有点儿让人受不了。”","“Really, Holmes,” said I severely, “you are a little trying at times.”"
"他完全沉浸在自己的思绪之中，没有立刻回答我的抗议。他一只手托着下巴，面前的早餐原封未动，眼睛直勾勾地盯着他刚刚从信封里抽出来的一张纸片。这之后，他把信封拿了起来，举到光亮的地方，仔仔细细地研究了一下信封的外观和封口。","He was too much absorbed with his own thoughts to give any immediate answer to my remonstrance. He leaned upon his hand, with his untasted breakfast before him, and he stared at the slip of paper which he had just drawn from its envelope. Then he took the envelope itself, held it up to the light, and very carefully studied both the exterior and the flap."
"“这是波洛克的笔迹，”他若有所思地说道。“波洛克的笔迹我虽然只见过两次，可我几乎可以断定这是他写的东西。这个希腊式的字母‘e’顶端带点儿花体，恰好是他的特征。不过，如果这封信真的来自波洛克的话，信里讲的就一定是一件至关紧要的事情。”","“It is Porlock’s writing,” said he thoughtfully. “I can hardly doubt that it is Porlock’s writing, though I have seen it only twice before. The Greek e with the peculiar top flourish is distinctive. But if it is Porlock, then it must be something of the very first importance.”"
"他不像是在对我说话，更像是自言自语，可他的话让我一下子充满好奇，忘记了刚才的不快。","He was speaking to himself rather than to me; but my vexation disappeared in the interest which the words awakened."
"“那么，波洛克是谁呢？”我问道。","“Who then is Porlock?” I asked."
"“华生啊，‘波洛克’只是一个笔名、一个身份标记而已，它代表的是一个变化多端、藏头露尾的人物[^1]。在前面的一封信当中，他坦白地告诉我这不是他的真名，还叫我尽管去试，看看我能不能在这座大都市的百万人海当中查出他来。波洛克非常重要，不是因为他自己，而是因为跟他有交道的那个大人物。你不妨把他想象成鲨鱼身边的引水鱼[^2]，或者是狮子左右的豺狼，总之就是个微不足道的角色，但却跟某个十分强大的家伙混在一起。他身边的那个家伙不光是强大而已，华生，而且还十分邪恶，邪恶到了无以复加的程度。这就是我对那个家伙的评价。你听我提过莫里亚蒂教授吗？”","“Porlock, Watson, is a nom-de-plume, a mere identification mark; but behind it lies a shifty and evasive personality. In a former letter he frankly informed me that the name was not his own, and defied me ever to trace him among the teeming millions of this great city. Porlock is important, not for himself, but for the great man with whom he is in touch. Picture to yourself the pilot fish with the shark, the jackal with the lion—anything that is insignificant in companionship with what is formidable: not only formidable, Watson, but sinister—in the highest degree sinister. That is where he comes within my purview. You have heard me speak of Professor Moriarty?”"
"“那个著名的科学罪犯，在歹徒当中广为人知的程度正如——”","“The famous scientific criminal, as famous among crooks as—”"
"“我真替你难为情，华生！”福尔摩斯不以为然地咕哝了一句。","“My blushes, Watson!” Holmes murmured in a deprecating voice."
"“我要说的是，正如在公众当中鲜为人知的程度一样惊人[^3]。”","“I was about to say, as he is unknown to the public.”"
"“点中了！确实让你给点中了！[^4]”福尔摩斯叫道。“华生，你显然是学会了一种本事，懂得冷不丁地开暗藏机关的玩笑了，我可得防着点儿。不过，你把莫里亚蒂叫做罪犯，本身倒是口出诽谤之言，为法律所不容——他的本事高就高在这里、妙就妙在这里！有史以来最了不起的阴谋家、所有暴行的策划者、控制地下世界的神经中枢、左右各国命运的大脑——他就是这么个人物！可他距离公众的猜疑是那么地遥远，跟外界的非议是那么地不相干，隐身幕后操控一切的手法又是那么地令人叫绝，以至于光凭你刚才说的那几句话，他就可以拖着你去对簿公堂，把你整整一年的年金变成他的名誉损失费。《小行星动力学》一书的理论数学水平达到了唯我独尊的高度，据说整个科学舆论界都没有人能对它提出任何批评，那本奇书的著名作者不就是他吗？这样的人是可以随便中伤的吗？满嘴胡言的医生和清誉受损的教授，这就是你们俩各自扮演的角色！他可真是个天才，华生。不过，只要我没在那些小阴沟里翻了船，咱们就必然会有旗开得胜的一天。”","“A touch! A distinct touch!” cried Holmes. “You are developing a certain unexpected vein of pawky humour, Watson, against which I must learn to guard myself. But in calling Moriarty a criminal you are uttering libel in the eyes of the law—and there lie the glory and the wonder of it! The greatest schemer of all time, the organizer of every deviltry, the controlling brain of the underworld, a brain which might have made or marred the destiny of nations—that’s the man! But so aloof is he from general suspicion, so immune from criticism, so admirable in his management and self-effacement, that for those very words that you have uttered he could hale you to a court and emerge with your year’s pension as a solatium for his wounded character. Is he not the celebrated author of *The Dynamics of an Asteroid*, a book which ascends to such rarefied heights of pure mathematics that it is said that there was no man in the scientific press capable of criticizing it? Is this a man to traduce? Foul-mouthed doctor and slandered professor—such would be your respective rôles! That’s genius, Watson. But if I am spared by lesser men, our day will surely come.”"
"“但愿我能够亲眼见证那一天！”我热忱地高喊一声。“不过，你刚才谈的可是波洛克这个家伙的事情。”","“May I be there to see!” I exclaimed devoutly. “But you were speaking of this man Porlock.”"
"“呃，没错——所谓的波洛克是链条当中的一个环节，离那个了不起的核心距离不远。咱俩私下说啊，波洛克这个环节并不是特别牢靠。根据我现有的测试结果来看，他是那根链条当中唯一的一个薄弱环节。”","“Ah, yes—the so-called Porlock is a link in the chain some little way from its great attachment. Porlock is not quite a sound link—between ourselves. He is the only flaw in that chain so far as I have been able to test it.”"
"“可是，链条的牢靠程度总是由最薄弱的一个环节来决定的啊。”","“But no chain is stronger than its weakest link.”"
"“一点儿不错，亲爱的华生！就是因为这一点，波洛克才显得极端重要。这个人总算是良心未泯，加上我时不时地采取一种助人向善的明智举措，转弯抹角地送他一张十镑的钞票，结果呢，有那么一两次，他赶在事发之前给过我一些很有价值的情报——那些情报的价值可以说是无可比拟，因为它们可以帮助我预防犯罪，而不是事后再去讨还公道。我敢说，要是能找到解码方法的话，咱们肯定会发现，眼下这封信也属于我刚才提到的那个类型。”","“Exactly, my dear Watson! Hence the extreme importance of Porlock. Led on by some rudimentary aspirations towards right, and encouraged by the judicious stimulation of an occasional ten-pound note sent to him by devious methods, he has once or twice given me advance information which has been of value—that highest value which anticipates and prevents rather than avenges crime. I cannot doubt that, if we had the cipher, we should find that this communication is of the nature that I indicate.”"
"福尔摩斯再一次把纸片平摊在他那个未曾使用的碟子上。我站起身来，低下头去，隔着他的肩膀看到了以下的古怪符号：","Again Holmes flattened out the paper upon his unused plate. I rose and, leaning over him, stared down at the curious inscription, which ran as follows:"
"> 534 C2 13 127 36 31 4 17 21 41 ","> 534 C2 13 127 36 31 4 17 21 41"
"> Douglas 109 293 5 37 Birlstone ","> Douglas 109 293 5 37 Birlstone"
"> 26 Birlstone 9 47 171","> 26 Birlstone 9 47 171"
"“你觉得这是什么意思呢，福尔摩斯？”","“What do you make of it, Holmes?”"
"“显而易见，这是想向咱们提供一份机密情报。”","“It is obviously an attempt to convey secret information.”"
"“可是，不附上解码的方法，密信能有什么用处呢？”","“But what is the use of a cipher message without the cipher?”"
"“就这个例子来说，一点儿用处也没有。”","“In this instance, none at all.”"
"“你为什么要强调‘就这个例子来说’呢？”","“Why do you say ‘in this instance’?”"
"“原因在于，我可以轻而易举地解读很多密码，就跟解读报纸私人启事栏里的那些天方夜谭一样简单：解读那些粗糙的密码只是一种有趣的消遣，算不上一种智力上的负担。眼前的这个例子就不同了，这些符号显然是代表着某本书某一页当中的词语，不知道具体是哪本书哪一页的话，我是完全奈它们不何的。”","“Because there are many ciphers which I would read as easily as I do the apocrypha of the agony column: such crude devices amuse the intelligence without fatiguing it. But this is different. It is clearly a reference to the words in a page of some book. Until I am told which page and which book I am powerless.”"
"“可是，信里面为什么又有 ‘Douglas’（道格拉斯）和‘Birlstone’（伯尔斯通）这样的词语呢？”","“But why ‘Douglas’ and ‘Birlstone’?”"
"“当然是因为那一页当中找不出这两个词来。”","“Clearly because those are words which were not contained in the page in question.”"
"“那么，他为什么不指明是哪一本书呢？”","“Then why has he not indicated the book?”"
"“单凭你生来就有的精明，亲爱的华生，单凭你那种让朋友们喜闻乐见的固有智术，你也绝不会把解码的方法和密信装进同一个信封。那样的话，信一旦有了闪失，你这个人也就完蛋了。眼下呢，除非是两封信都有了闪失，否则就不会造成任何危险。我说，咱们的第二班邮差应该已经到了才对啊，不出意外的话，邮差送来的要么是一封补充说明的信件，要么就是与这些数字相关的那本书，书的可能性还要大一些。”","“Your native shrewdness, my dear Watson, that innate cunning which is the delight of your friends, would surely prevent you from inclosing cipher and message in the same envelope. Should it miscarry, you are undone. As it is, both have to go wrong before any harm comes from it. Our second post is now overdue, and I shall be surprised if it does not bring us either a further letter of explanation, or, as is more probable, the very volume to which these figures refer.”"
"一两分钟之内，福尔摩斯的预测就得到了验证。我们的小听差比利[^5]走进房间，送来了我们正在等待的那封信。","Holmes’s calculation was fulfilled within a very few minutes by the appearance of Billy, the page, with the very letter which we were expecting."
"“同样的笔迹，”他一边说，一边把信拆开，“而且实实在在地署上了名字，”他展开信纸，兴高采烈地补了一句。“过来看看，华生，看看咱们的进展。”不过，读完信之后，他的脸上罩上了一层乌云。","“The same writing,” remarked Holmes, as he opened the envelope, “and actually signed,” he added in an exultant voice as he unfolded the epistle. “Come, we are getting on, Watson.” His brow clouded, however, as he glanced over the contents."
"“天哪，这可真是太叫人失望了！要我说，华生，咱们恐怕是白等了一场。波洛克这家伙可别出什么事儿啊。他的信是这么写的：","“Dear me, this is very disappointing! I fear, Watson, that all our expectations come to nothing. I trust that the man Porlock will come to no harm."
"> “亲爱的福尔摩斯先生：","> “Dear Mr. Holmes [he says]:"
"> 这事情我不打算接着干了。太危险了——他对我起了疑心。我看得出来，他对我起了疑心。我刚刚写好这封信的信封，打算把解码的线索寄给你，他已经出其不意地出现在了我的面前。好在我把信给盖住了，要是被他瞧见的话，我可就吃不了兜着走啦。可是，我已经看到了他怀疑的眼神。把那封密信烧了吧，眼下你拿着它也没用了。","> I will go no further in this matter. It is too dangerous—he suspects me. I can see that he suspects me. He came to me quite unexpectedly after I had actually addressed this envelope with the intention of sending you the key to the cipher. I was able to cover it up. If he had seen it, it would have gone hard with me. But I read suspicion in his eyes. Please burn the cipher message, which can now be of no use to you."
"> 弗雷德 ·波洛克”","> FreD Porlock.”"
"福尔摩斯皱着眉头坐了一小会儿，把信拿在手里揉来揉去，眼睛直勾勾地盯着炉火。","Holmes sat for some little time twisting this letter between his fingers, and frowning, as he stared into the fire."
"“说来说去，”他终于开了口，“兴许他并没有受到怀疑，不过是自己心虚而已。他清楚自己的叛徒身份，自然会在对方的眼睛里看到谴责的神色。 ”","“After all,” he said at last, “there may be nothing in it. It may be only his guilty conscience. Knowing himself to be a traitor, he may have read the accusation in the other’s eyes.”"
"“你说的‘对方’，应该就是莫里亚蒂教授吧。”","“The other being, I presume, Professor Moriarty.”"
"“如假包换！他们那帮人嘴里的‘他’，不用问你也知道是谁。凌驾于他们所有人之上的，只有这么一个‘他’。”","“No less! When any of that party talk about ‘He’ you know whom they mean. There is one predominant ‘He’ for all of them.”"
"“可是，他究竟能把波洛克怎么样呢？”","“But what can he do?”"
"“哼！你这个问题问得真好。他拥有全欧洲数一数二的头脑，所有的黑暗势力都听凭他的差遣，有这样的一个人跟你作对，什么样的事情都有可能发生。不管怎么样，咱们的波洛克老兄反正已经被他吓得灵魂出窍——麻烦你拿信封上的笔迹跟信纸上的笔迹作个对比，按波洛克的说法，信封是在那个丧门星到来之前写的。前一种笔迹又清晰又肯定，后一种呢，差不多都要没法认了。”","“Hum! That’s a large question. When you have one of the first brains of Europe up against you, and all the powers of darkness at his back, there are infinite possibilities. Anyhow, Friend Porlock is evidently scared out of his senses—kindly compare the writing in the note to that upon its envelope; which was done, he tells us, before this ill-omened visit. The one is clear and firm. The other hardly legible.”"
"“那他干吗还写第二封信呢？索性就此罢手不是更好吗？”","“Why did he write at all? Why did he not simply drop it?”"
"“他担心要是不作解释的话，我就会跑去追查这件事情，没准儿会让他惹上麻烦。”","“Because he feared I would make some inquiry after him in that case, and possibly bring trouble on him.”"
"“那倒也是，”我说道。“确实如此。”我已经拿起了最初的那封密信，这会儿便皱着眉头看了起来。“想到这张纸片承载着一个重大的秘密，又想到纸上的密码超出了凡人所能破解的范围，简直会让人急出疯病来呢。”","“No doubt,” said I. “Of course.” I had picked up the original cipher message and was bending my brows over it. “It’s pretty maddening to think that an important secret may lie here on this slip of paper, and that it is beyond human power to penetrate it.”"
"歇洛克·福尔摩斯已经推开一口没尝的早餐，点上了不甚可口的烟斗，那是他专注思考之时的必有良伴。“我看不见得！”他一边说，一边往椅子上一靠，目光定在了天花板上。“说不定，尽管你拥有马基雅维利[^6]一般的头脑，信里的一些东西还是逃过了你的注意。好了，咱们不妨通过纯粹的演绎来解决这个问题。这个人的密码钥匙是一本书，这就是咱们的演绎起点。”","Sherlock Holmes had pushed away his untasted breakfast and lit the unsavoury pipe which was the companion of his deepest meditations. “I wonder!” said he, leaning back and staring at the ceiling. “Perhaps there are points which have escaped your Machiavellian intellect. Let us consider the problem in the light of pure reason. This man’s reference is to a book. That is our point of departure.”"
"“这个起点多少有点儿宽泛啊。 ”","“A somewhat vague one.”"
"“那咱们就想想办法，看看能不能把它收窄一点儿。仔细想来，我觉得它也不是那么难于破解。关于这本书，咱们有一些什么样的提示呢？”","“Let us see then if we can narrow it down. As I focus my mind upon it, it seems rather less impenetrable. What indications have we as to this book?”"
"“什么也没有。 ”","“None.”"
"“好啦，好啦，情况绝对没有糟糕到这种地步。密信的开头是一个大大的‘534’，对吧？咱们不妨假定，534就是与密信相关的那一页的页码。由此可知，这本书必然是一部大部头，这么着，咱们就算是有了一点儿进展。关于这本大部头，咱们还有些什么提示呢？接下来的标记是‘C2’。这你怎么看呢，华生？”","“Well, well, it is surely not quite so bad as that. The cipher message begins with a large 534, does it not? We may take it as a working hypothesis that 534 is the particular page to which the cipher refers. So our book has already become a *large* book, which is surely something gained. What other indications have we as to the nature of this large book? The next sign is C2. What do you make of that, Watson?”"
"“意思是第二章，错不了。 ”","“Chapter the second, no doubt.”"
"“多半不是，华生。依我看，你肯定会同意我的看法，既然已经有了页码，再指明章节未免有点儿多余。再说了，如果第534页才到第二章的话，第一章的长度一定达到了让人忍无可忍的地步。”","“Hardly that, Watson. You will, I am sure, agree with me that if the page be given, the number of the chapter is immaterial. Also that if page 534 finds us only in the second chapter, the length of the first one must have been really intolerable.”"
"“第二栏！[^7]我大叫一声。","“Column!” I cried."
"“聪明啊，华生，今天早上你可真是灵光四射。如果这不是指第二栏的话，那我就算是栽了一个大跟头。好了，你瞧，咱们眼前已经出现了一本双栏排印的大部头，每一栏都相当长，因为密信当中指明了一个序号是二百九十三的词语。到这个地方，咱们的演绎算不算是到了头呢？”","“Brilliant, Watson. You are scintillating this morning. If it is not column, then I am very much deceived. So now, you see, we begin to visualize a large book, printed in double columns, which are each of a considerable length, since one of the words is numbered in the document as the two hundred and ninety-third. Have we reached the limits of what reason can supply?”"
"“要我看，恐怕是到了头。 ”","“I fear that we have.”"
"“你显然是低估了自己的能力。再闪点儿灵光出来吧，亲爱的华生——再让你的灵机动一动！如果这本书不太常见的话，他一定会把它寄给我。可他没有这么做，在计划受挫之前，他的打算只是把关于书的线索装在这个信封里寄给我。他的信里就是这么说的。由此看来，他认为我自个儿也可以轻而易举地找到这本书。这本书他自己有，并且相信我也有。一句话，华生，这是一本十分常见的书。”","“Surely you do yourself an injustice. One more coruscation, my dear Watson—yet another brain-wave! Had the volume been an unusual one, he would have sent it to me. Instead of that, he had intended, before his plans were nipped, to send me the clue in this envelope. He says so in his note. This would seem to indicate that the book is one which he thought I would have no difficulty in finding for myself. He had it—and he imagined that I would have it, too. In short, Watson, it is a very common book.”"
"“你这个推测确实很有道理。”","“What you say certainly sounds plausible.”"
"“这一来，咱们就把搜索目标缩小成了一本双栏排印、十分常见的大部头。”","“So we have contracted our field of search to a large book, printed in double columns and in common use.”"
"“《圣经》！”我发出一声胜利的叫喊。","“The Bible!” I cried triumphantly."
"“很好，华生，很好！只可惜还没有，容我补充一句，好到十分！即便我本人当得起你这句美言，可我实在想象不出，还有哪本书比《圣经》更不可能出现在莫里亚蒂党羽的手边。[^8]再者说，《圣经》的版本千千万万，他不可能假定他那本《圣经》的页码编排跟我这本一样。显而易见，咱们要找的是一本格式统一的书，只有这样，他才可以断定，他那本的 534页就是我这本的534页。","“Good, Watson, good! But not, if I may say so, quite good enough! Even if I accepted the compliment for myself, I could hardly name any volume which would be less likely to lie at the elbow of one of Moriarty’s associates. Besides, the editions of Holy Writ are so numerous that he could hardly suppose that two copies would have the same pagination. This is clearly a book which is standardized. He knows for certain that his page 534 will exactly agree with my page 534.”"
"“这样的书很少啊。”","“But very few books would correspond with that.”"
"“一点儿不错。咱们的希望就在这里。好了，咱们的目标已经进一步缩小，变成了一本人人都会有的标准化书籍。”","“Exactly. Therein lies our salvation. Our search is narrowed down to standardized books which anyone may be supposed to possess.”"
"“《列车时刻表》！[^9]”","“Bradshaw!”"
"“这也是讲不通的，华生。《列车时刻表》使用的词汇固然简洁有力，数量却十分有限。它提供的那些词汇很难用来传递其他类型的讯息。咱们得把《列车时刻表》排除在外，词典嘛，恐怕也不能接受，原因跟《列车时刻表》一样。还剩什么呢？”","“There are difficulties, Watson. The vocabulary of Bradshaw is nervous and terse, but limited. The selection of words would hardly lend itself to the sending of general messages. We will eliminate Bradshaw. The dictionary is, I fear, inadmissible for the same reason. What then is left?”"
"“年鉴！”","“An almanac!”"
"“好极了，华生！这次你要还没猜中的话，那我就真是大错特错了。年鉴！咱们来考虑一下《惠特克年鉴》[^10]的入选资格吧。它十分常见，页码足够多，双栏排印，前面部分的词汇量虽然有限，靠近结尾的部分呢，如果我没记错的话，词汇还是相当丰富的。”他从自己的写字台上拿起了那本年鉴。“喏，这就是534页，第二栏，我看到了，是一篇字数很多的文章，讲的是英属印度的贸易和资源。把这些词写下来，华生！第十三个词是‘Mahratta’（马拉塔）[^11]。要我说，这个头开得不怎么吉利啊。第一百二十七个词是‘Government’（政府），这个词总算有点儿意义，话说回来，它似乎跟咱们和莫里亚蒂教授都扯不上什么关系。咱们接着往下看吧。马拉塔政府干了些什么呢？哎唷！下一个词是‘pig’s-bristles’（猪鬃）。咱们完了，我的好华生啊！没戏唱了！”","“Excellent, Watson! I am very much mistaken if you have not touched the spot. An almanac! Let us consider the claims of Whitaker’s Almanac. It is in common use. It has the requisite number of pages. It is in double column. Though reserved in its earlier vocabulary, it becomes, if I remember right, quite garrulous towards the end.” He picked the volume from his desk. “Here is page 534, column two, a substantial block of print dealing, I perceive, with the trade and resources of British India. Jot down the words, Watson! Number thirteen is ‘Mahratta.’ Not, I fear, a very auspicious beginning. Number one hundred and twenty-seven is ‘Government’; which at least makes sense, though somewhat irrelevant to ourselves and Professor Moriarty. Now let us try again. What does the Mahratta government do? Alas! the next word is ‘pig’s-bristles.’ We are undone, my good Watson! It is finished!”"
"他说话的口气虽然轻松俏皮，抽动的浓眉却让他心里的失望和懊恼暴露无遗。我无可奈何地坐在那里，闷闷不乐地盯着炉火。一段漫长的沉默之后，福尔摩斯突然大叫一声，冲到一个橱柜跟前，从里面拿出了另一本黄色封皮的《惠特克年鉴》。","He had spoken in jesting vein, but the twitching of his bushy eyebrows bespoke his disappointment and irritation. I sat helpless and unhappy, staring into the fire. A long silence was broken by a sudden exclamation from Holmes, who dashed at a cupboard, from which he emerged with a second yellow-covered volume in his hand."
"“咱们赶潮流赶得太快，华生，这回可算是有教训了！”他高声说道。“咱们走在了时间的前面，活该受这样的惩罚。眼下才一月七号，咱们就应时应节地弄来了一本新年鉴。十有八九，波洛克写信的时候用的还是旧年鉴。毫无疑问，如果能把那封提示信件写出来的话，他肯定会把这一点讲清楚的。好了，咱们来看一看，这一本的534页给咱们准备了一些什么货色。第十三个词是‘There’（今），看着可比上一次的希望大多了。第一百二十七个词是‘is’（有）——‘There is’（今有）”——福尔摩斯的眼睛闪出了兴奋的火花，纤长有力的手指抖抖索索地数着文章里的词汇——“‘danger’（祸患）。哈！哈！妙极了！赶紧写下来，华生。‘There is danger——may——come——very——soon——one’（今有祸患，旦夕将临），然后是‘ Douglas’这个名字，再往后是‘rich——country——now——at——Birlstone——House——Birlstone——confidence——is——pressing’。[^12]瞧啊，华生！你说说看，纯粹演绎的效果怎么样？如果蔬菜铺子里有桂冠这种东西卖的话，我这就打发比利去给我买一顶。”","“We pay the price, Watson, for being too up-to-date!” he cried. “We are before our time, and suffer the usual penalties. Being the seventh of January, we have very properly laid in the new almanac. It is more than likely that Porlock took his message from the old one. No doubt he would have told us so had his letter of explanation been written. Now let us see what page 534 has in store for us. Number thirteen is ‘There,’ which is much more promising. Number one hundred and twenty-seven is ‘is’—‘There is’ ”—Holmes’s eyes were gleaming with excitement, and his thin, nervous fingers twitched as he counted the words—“ ‘danger.’ Ha! Ha! Capital! Put that down, Watson. ‘There is danger—may—come—very—soon—one.’ Then we have the name ‘Douglas’—‘rich—country—now—at—Birlstone—House—Birlstone—confidence—is—pressing.’ There, Watson! What do you think of pure reason and its fruit? If the green-grocer had such a thing as a laurel wreath, I should send Billy round for it.”"
"在福尔摩斯解读密信的过程当中，我把一张富士纸摊在自己的膝盖上，草草地记下了他的解读成果。到这会儿，我直愣愣地看着这条古怪的讯息。","I was staring at the strange message which I had scrawled, as he deciphered it, upon a sheet of foolscap on my knee."
"“他表达意思的方式可真是稀奇古怪、乱七八糟！”我说道。","“What a queer, scrambling way of expressing his meaning!” said I."
"“恰恰相反，他把自己的意思表达得非常好，”福尔摩斯说道。“如果你表达意思的词汇只能从孤零零的一栏文字里面选择，当然不可能要什么有什么，总有一部分的意思得靠收信的人自己去揣摩。这封信的主旨已经是清楚得不能再清楚了。有人阴谋算计某个名为道格拉斯的人，不管这个道格拉斯究竟是何方神圣，总之是一个富有的乡绅，就住在信里所说的那个地方。他确信事情万分紧急，只不过没有用‘confident’（确信）这个词，用的是‘confidence’（信任），因为这一栏当中只有这个词跟‘confident’最为接近。这就是咱们的成果——这段小小的演绎确实是有点儿技巧哩！”","“On the contrary, he has done quite remarkably well,” said Holmes. “When you search a single column for words with which to express your meaning, you can hardly expect to get everything you want. You are bound to leave something to the intelligence of your correspondent. The purport is perfectly clear. Some deviltry is intended against one Douglas, whoever he may be, residing as stated, a rich country gentleman. He is sure—‘confidence’ was as near as he could get to ‘confident’— that it is pressing. There is our result—and a very workmanlike little bit of analysis it was!”"
"跟真正的艺术家一样，如果作品没有达到自己的高远期许，福尔摩斯会表现得痛不欲生，同样道理，他也会为自己的得意之作表现出一种不带个人色彩的喜悦。这不，当比利一把推开房门、将苏格兰场的麦克唐纳督察领进房间的时候[^13]，福尔摩斯还在为这一次的成就吃吃地笑个不停呢。","Holmes had the impersonal joy of the true artist in his better work, even as he mourned darkly when it fell below the high level to which he aspired. He was still chuckling over his success when Billy swung open the door and Inspector MacDonald of Scotland Yard was ushered into the room."
"这个故事发生在遥远的十九世纪八十年代末期，那个时候，亚历克·麦克唐纳远不像如今这样举国闻名。当时的他还是警队里的一名年轻成员，不过也很受重用，因为他在奉命侦办的几件案子当中有过突出的表现。他身材高大、骨骼突出，一看就知道膂力过人，而他硕大的脑瓜和炯炯有神的深陷眼睛也以同样一目了然的方式表明，他那两道浓眉背后闪烁着耀眼的智慧火花。他沉默寡言、一板一眼、脾气倔犟，说话带有浓重的阿伯丁[^14]口音。","Those were the early days at the end of the ’80’s, when Alec MacDonald was far from having attained the national fame which he has now achieved. He was a young but trusted member of the detective force, who had distinguished himself in several cases which had been intrusted to him. His tall, bony figure gave promise of exceptional physical strength, while his great cranium and deep-set, lustrous eyes spoke no less clearly of the keen intelligence which twinkled out from behind his bushy eyebrows. He was a silent, precise man with a dour nature and a hard Aberdonian accent."
"在此之前，福尔摩斯已经两次帮助他成功破案，破案的功劳都给了他，福尔摩斯自己的收获仅仅是解决难题的智力享受。有了这样的铺垫，这个苏格兰人自然对这位业余同僚产生了极大的好感和敬重，表现则是他一遇上难题就老实不客气地跑来向福尔摩斯讨教。庸碌凡夫自以为登峰造极，禀赋超卓的人物却可以一眼看出他人的盖世天才，麦克唐纳拥有相当的职业禀赋，足以让他明白，向一个天赋和经验都已经冠绝全欧的人求教，并不是一件有伤颜面的事情。福尔摩斯并不喜欢结交朋友，但却对这个苏格兰大块头格外优待，看到他的时候还笑了起来。","Twice already in his career had Holmes helped him to attain success, his own sole reward being the intellectual joy of the problem. For this reason the affection and respect of the Scotchman for his amateur colleague were profound, and he showed them by the frankness with which he consulted Holmes in every difficulty. Mediocrity knows nothing higher than itself; but talent instantly recognizes genius, and MacDonald had talent enough for his profession to enable him to perceive that there was no humiliation in seeking the assistance of one who already stood alone in Europe, both in his gifts and in his experience. Holmes was not prone to friendship, but he was tolerant of the big Scotchman, and smiled at the sight of him."
"“你可真是只早起的鸟儿，麦克先生，”福尔摩斯说道。“希望老天爷多赏你几只虫子。要我说，你这么早来，恐怕是出了什么乱子吧。”","“You are an early bird, Mr. Mac,” said he. “I wish you luck with your worm. I fear this means that there is some mischief afoot.”"
"“福尔摩斯先生，我是这么想的，如果您把‘恐怕’换成‘但愿’的话，应该会更加符合事实，”督察回答道，脸上带着心照不宣的笑容。“呃，稍微来一口也好，可以挡一挡今天早上的刺骨寒气。不用，我不抽烟，谢谢您。一会儿我就得赶紧上路，因为案发之初的几个钟头再宝贵不过了，这一点您比谁都清楚。不过——不过——”","“If you said ‘hope’ instead of ‘fear,’ it would be nearer the truth, I’m thinking, Mr. Holmes,” the inspector answered, with a knowing grin. “Well, maybe a wee nip would keep out the raw morning chill. No, I won’t smoke, I thank you. I’ll have to be pushing on my way; for the early hours of a case are the precious ones, as no man knows better than your own self. But—but—”"
"督察突然打住话头，直勾勾地盯着桌上的一张纸片，脸上的表情惊愕至极。他看的正是我刚才用过的那张纸，纸上是我草草记下的那一条谜一般的讯息。","The inspector had stopped suddenly, and was staring with a look of absolute amazement at a paper upon the table. It was the sheet upon which I had scrawled the enigmatic message."
"“道格拉斯！”他结结巴巴地说道。“伯尔斯通！这是怎么回事，福尔摩斯先生？嘿，这简直是巫术啊！我的天，这些名字您究竟是从哪儿搞来的呢？”","“Douglas!” he stammered. “Birlstone! What’s this, Mr. Holmes? Man, it’s witchcraft! Where in the name of all that is wonderful did you get those names?”"
"“这是一封密信的内容，基于某种理由，我和华生医生破译了这封密信。可你为什么——这些名字有什么问题吗？”","“It is a cipher that Dr. Watson and I have had occasion to solve. But why—what’s amiss with the names?”"
"督察晕头转向地来回打量着我俩。“问题恰恰是，”他说道，“昨天夜里，伯尔斯通宅邸的道格拉斯先生遭到了惨无人道的谋杀！”","The inspector looked from one to the other of us in dazed astonishment. “Just this,” said he, “that Mr. Douglas of Birlstone Manor House was horribly murdered last night!”"
"歇洛克·福尔摩斯的妙论","Sherlock Holmes Discourses"
"这一刻可谓惊心动魄，而我朋友正是为这样的时刻而生。听到这个惊人消息之后，他的反应不光不能说是震撼，就说是激动都嫌过分。他的特异性情之中并不包含哪怕是一丝残忍的成分，毋庸置疑的是，长期以来的过度刺激已经让他的神经结上了一层茧子。话说回来，即便他的情感确实已经趋于迟钝，他的理性认知却只能说是活跃得出奇。这样一来，督察的这句简短声明让我惊骇不已，而他没有任何表示，脸上只有一种饶有兴趣的沉静表情，仿佛是一位化学家，正在看自己配制的过饱和溶液析出晶体。","It was one of those dramatic moments for which my friend existed. It would be an overstatement to say that he was shocked or even excited by the amazing announcement. Without having a tinge of cruelty in his singular composition, he was undoubtedly callous from long over-stimulation. Yet, if his emotions were dulled, his intellectual perceptions were exceedingly active. There was no trace then of the horror which I had myself felt at this curt declaration; but his face showed rather the quiet and interested composure of the chemist who sees the crystals falling into position from his oversaturated solution."
"“不一般！”他说道。“不一般！”","“Remarkable!” said he. “Remarkable!”"
"“您好像并不觉得惊讶啊。”","“You don’t seem surprised.”"
"“关注而已，麦克先生，惊讶可谈不上。我有什么理由感到惊讶呢？我从某个地方收到了一条我知道十分重要的匿名讯息，由此知道某个人面临危险。接下来不到一个钟头，我得知危险变成了现实，那个人已经死亡。这事情确实引起了我的关注，不过，就像你看到的那样，并没有让我感到惊讶。”","“Interested, Mr. Mac, but hardly surprised. Why should I be surprised? I receive an anonymous communication from a quarter which I know to be important, warning me that danger threatens a certain person. Within an hour I learn that this danger has actually materialized and that the person is dead. I am interested; but, as you observe, I am not surprised.”"
"这之后，他三言两语地向督察讲清了关于信件和密码的种种事实。麦克唐纳坐在那里，双手托着下巴，浓密的沙色眉毛拧成了一个黄色的结。","In a few short sentences he explained to the inspector the facts about the letter and the cipher. MacDonald sat with his chin on his hands and his great sandy eyebrows bunched into a yellow tangle."
"“我本打算今早就去伯尔斯通，”他说道。“来这里是想问您愿不愿意跟我一起去——我是说，您和您的朋友。可是，从您刚才说的这些事情来看，咱们还是在伦敦调查比较好。” ","“I was going down to Birlstone this morning,” said he. “I had come to ask you if you cared to come with me—you and your friend here. But from what you say we might perhaps be doing better work in London.”"
"“我倒不这么觉得，”福尔摩斯说道。","“I rather think not,” said Holmes."
"“得了吧，福尔摩斯先生！”督察叫道。“一两天之内，伯尔斯通谜案就会占满各家报纸的版面。可是，既然已经有人在伦敦预见了这桩罪行，它还叫什么谜案呢？咱们只需要把这个人抓来就行了，其他的问题自然会迎刃而解。”","“Hang it all, Mr. Holmes!” cried the inspector. “The papers will be full of the Birlstone mystery in a day or two; but where’s the mystery if there is a man in London who prophesied the crime before ever it occurred? We have only to lay our hands on that man, and the rest will follow.”"
"“你说得对极了，麦克先生。不过，你打算用什么方法去抓这个所谓的波洛克呢？”","“No doubt, Mr. Mac. But how do you propose to lay your hands on the so-called Porlock?”"
"麦克唐纳把福尔摩斯递给他的信翻了一面。“信是从坎伯维尔街区寄来的，这一点对咱们没多大帮助。名字嘛，您已经说了是假的。是的，咱们手里的线索确实不多。可是，您刚才不是说您给过他钱吗？”","MacDonald turned over the letter which Holmes had handed him. “Posted in Camberwell that doesn’t help us much. Name, you say, is assumed. Not much to go on, certainly. Didn’t you say that you have sent him money?”"
"“给过两次。”","“Twice.”"
"“怎么给的呢？”","“And how?”"
"“把钞票寄到坎伯维尔邮局。”","“In notes to Camberwell post-office.”"
"“您就没有劳神去看看取钞票的人吗？”","“Did you ever trouble to see who called for them?”"
"“没有。”","“No.”"
"督察的表情有点儿惊讶，甚至可以说是有点儿震撼。“为什么呢？”","The inspector looked surprised and a little shocked. “Why not?”"
"“因为我一向说话算话。他第一次写信给我的时候，我已经答应了他，不会去追查他的身份。”","“Because I always keep faith. I had promised when he first wrote that I would not try to trace him.”"
"“您认为他背后还有别人，对吗？”","“You think there is someone behind him?”"
"“不是认为，我知道还有别人。”","“I *know* there is.”"
"“就是您提过的那位教授吗？”","“This professor that I’ve heard you mention?”"
"“还能是谁！”","“Exactly!”"
"麦克唐纳督察笑了起来，还冲我挤了挤眼睛。“我跟您实说了吧，福尔摩斯先生，我们刑事侦缉处的人都觉得，您对那位教授稍微有那么一点儿神经过敏。我自个儿也对这件事情进行了一些调查，他似乎是个非常体面、非常渊博、非常有才干的人。”","Inspector MacDonald smiled, and his eyelid quivered as he glanced towards me. “I won’t conceal from you, Mr. Holmes, that we think in the C.I.D. that you have a wee bit of a bee in your bonnet over this professor. I made some inquiries myself about the matter. He seems to be a very respectable, learned, and talented sort of man.”"
"“你居然看出了他的才干，我真是高兴极了。 ”","“I’m glad you’ve got so far as to recognize the talent.”"
"“咳，想不看出来也不行啊！听过您对他的看法之后，我打定主意要去会会他。我跟他聊了聊关于日食的问题，怎么聊起来的我记不得了，总之他搬出一台反光灯和一个地球仪，只用了一分钟就把这个问题讲得清清楚楚。他还借了一本书给我，可我不怕跟您说，虽说我在阿伯丁也受过很好的教育，那本书还是有点儿超出了我的智力。他脸庞瘦削、头发花白，说起话来跟讲道一样，准保能成为一位了不起的母（牧）师[^1]。我告辞的时候，他把手放到了我的肩膀上，感觉就像是父亲正在祝福即将踏入冷酷社会的孩子。”","“Man, you can’t but recognize it! After I heard your view I made it my business to see him. I had a chat with him on eclipses. How the talk got that way I canna think; but he had out a reflector lantern and a globe, and made it all clear in a minute. He lent me a book; but I don’t mind saying that it was a bit above my head, though I had a good Aberdeen upbringing. He’d have made a grand meenister with his thin face and gray hair and solemn-like way of talking. When he put his hand on my shoulder as we were parting, it was like a father’s blessing before you go out into the cold, cruel world.”"
"福尔摩斯吃吃地笑了起来，搓了搓自己的双手。“妙极了！”他说道。“妙极了！据我看，麦克唐纳老弟，你们这次愉快感人的会晤应该是发生在教授的书房里，对不对？”","Holmes chuckled and rubbed his hands. “Great!” he said. “Great! Tell me, Friend MacDonald, this pleasing and touching interview was, I suppose, in the professor’s study?”"
"“对。 ”","“That’s so.”"
"“房间不错，对吧？”","“A fine room, is it not?”"
"“非常不错——实际上是漂亮极了，福尔摩斯先生。 ”","“Very fine—very handsome indeed, Mr. Holmes.”"
"“你坐在他那张写字台跟前，对吧？”","“You sat in front of his writing desk?”"
"“没错。 ”","“Just so.”"
"“阳光照进了你的眼睛，他的脸却在阴影里，对吧？”","“Sun in your eyes and his face in the shadow?”"
"“呃，我是晚上去的。可我确实记得，灯光是照在我脸上的。 ”","“Well, it was evening; but I mind that the lamp was turned on my face.”"
"“理当如此。教授那把椅子的上方挂着一幅画，当时你有没有注意到呢？”","“It would be. Did you happen to observe a picture over the professor’s head?”"
"“我这个人可不会漏过太多细节，福尔摩斯先生。说不定，这还是跟您学的呢。是的，我看到了那幅画，画的是一个年轻女人，双手托着脑袋，斜着眼睛看人。”","“I don’t miss much, Mr. Holmes. Maybe I learned that from you. Yes, I saw the picture—a young woman with her head on her hands, peeping at you sideways.”"
"“那幅画是让·巴蒂斯特·格勒兹[^2]的作品。 ”","“That painting was by Jean Baptiste Greuze.”"
"督察努力装出一副兴致勃勃的模样。","The inspector endeavoured to look interested."
"“让 ·巴蒂斯特 ·格勒兹，”福尔摩斯接着说道，双手的指尖顶在一起，身子深深地倒进了背后的椅子，“是活跃于一七五○至一八○○年间的一位法国画家，当然喽，我这里说的是他的职业生涯。他在世的时候就享有很高的声誉，当代的评论家更是对他赞不绝口。 ”","“Jean Baptiste Greuze,” Holmes continued, joining his finger tips and leaning well back in his chair, “was a French artist who flourished between the years 1750 and 1800. I allude, of course, to his working career. Modern criticism has more than indorsed the high opinion formed of him by his contemporaries.”"
"督察的眼神渐渐地迷茫起来。“咱们是不是应该——”他说道。","The inspector’s eyes grew abstracted. “Hadn’t we better—” he said."
"“不是应该，咱们正在这么做，”福尔摩斯打断了他。“我说的所有事情都跟你所说的伯尔斯通谜案存在十分直接、至关紧要的联系。事实上，从某种意义上说，我正在谈论这件谜案的核心。 ”","“We are doing so,” Holmes interrupted. “All that I am saying has a very direct and vital bearing upon what you have called the Birlstone Mystery. In fact, it may in a sense be called the very centre of it.”"
"麦克唐纳勉勉强强地笑了笑，求助般地看了看我。“对我来说，您的思维跳跃得有点儿太快了，福尔摩斯先生。您少讲了一两个环节，而我自个儿又补不上。说一千道一万，那个死掉了的画匠跟伯尔斯通的事情究竟能有什么联系呢？”","MacDonald smiled feebly, and looked appealingly to me. “Your thoughts move a bit too quick for me, Mr. Holmes. You leave out a link or two, and I can’t get over the gap. What in the whole wide world can be the connection between this dead painting man and the affair at Birlstone?”"
"“对于一名侦探来说，世上没有无用的知识，”福尔摩斯说道。“说不定，即便是以下这件琐碎事情也可以让你展开一系列的联想：一八六五年，名为《少女与羔羊》的格勒兹作品在波塔利斯拍卖会上卖到了一百二十万法郎，也就是超过四万英镑[^3]。”","“All knowledge comes useful to the detective,” remarked Holmes. “Even the trivial fact that in the year 1865 a picture by Greuze entitled ‘La Jeune Fille á l’Agneau’ fetched one million two hundred thousand francs—more than forty thousand pounds—at the Portalis sale may start a train of reflection in your mind.”"
"显而易见，这件事情确实引发了一系列的联想。到这会儿，督察脸上的兴趣不像是装的了。","It was clear that it did. The inspector looked honestly interested."
"“我还可以提醒你一下，”福尔摩斯接着说道，“好几种可靠的参考书籍都可以帮助我们确定教授的薪资。教授的薪资是一年七百镑。”","“I may remind you,” Holmes continued, “that the professor’s salary can be ascertained in several trust-worthy books of reference. It is seven hundred a year.”"
"“那他怎么买得起——”","“Then how could he buy—”"
"“可不是嘛！他怎么买得起呢？”","“Quite so! How could he?”"
"“没错，这事情确实很不寻常，”督察若有所思地说道。“接着说啊，福尔摩斯先生。我爱听极了，妙极了！”","“Ay, that’s remarkable,” said the inspector thoughtfully. “Talk away, Mr. Holmes. I’m just loving it. It’s fine!”"
"福尔摩斯露出了笑容。跟真正的艺术家一样，真诚的赞美总是会让他觉得格外愉快。“伯尔斯通的事情怎么办呢？”他问道。","Holmes smiled. He was always warmed by genuine admiration—the characteristic of the real artist. “What about Birlstone?” he asked."
"“时间还来得及，”督察一边说，一边看了看表。“有辆出租马车在门口等我，从这儿到维多利亚车站用不了二十分钟。咱们接着说这幅画吧：我记得您跟我提过一次，福尔摩斯先生，您从来没有见过莫里亚蒂教授。”","“We’ve time yet,” said the inspector, glancing at his watch. “I’ve a cab at the door, and it won’t take us twenty minutes to Victoria. But about this picture: I thought you told me once, Mr. Holmes, that you had never met Professor Moriarty.”"
"“是的，我从来没有见过他。 ”","“No, I never have.”"
"“那您怎么会知道他房间里的情形呢？”","“Then how do you know about his rooms?”"
"“这个嘛，当然是另外一回事情。我到他家里去过三次，前两次都是找了不同的借口去等着见他，然后又赶在他出现之前溜之大吉。最后一次，呃，这一次可不太方便告诉一位警方的探员。就是这一次，我冒昧地浏览了一下他的文件，结果就有了一个极其惊人的发现。”","“Ah, that’s another matter. I have been three times in his rooms, twice waiting for him under different pretexts and leaving before he came. Once—well, I can hardly tell about the once to an official detective. It was on the last occasion that I took the liberty of running over his papers—with the most unexpected results.”"
"“您发现他的罪证了吗？”","“You found something compromising?”"
"“什么也没发现，惊人就惊人在这个地方。不过，眼下你已经看到了那幅画的意义，意义就是他这个人十分富有。他的财富是怎么来的呢？他没有结婚，弟弟不过是英格兰西部的一个火车站站长[^4]，自己的教席也只能带来一年七百镑的收入，可他竟然拥有一幅格勒兹的作品。”","“Absolutely nothing. That was what amazed me. However, you have now seen the point of the picture. It shows him to be a very wealthy man. How did he acquire wealth? He is unmarried. His younger brother is a station master in the west of England. His chair is worth seven hundred a year. And he owns a Greuze.”"
"“怎样呢？”","“Well?”"
"“其中的含意只能说是一目了然。”","“Surely the inference is plain.”"
"“您是说他拥有非法取得的巨额收入，是吗？”","“You mean that he has a great income and that he must earn it in an illegal fashion?”"
"“一点儿不错。当然喽，我这个判断还有其他的依据——那个毒物一动不动地潜伏在网子的中央，几十条若有若无的纤细丝线把我引到了那里。我只跟你提到了格勒兹的画，不过是因为你亲眼看见过那件东西而已。”","“Exactly. Of course I have other reasons for thinking so— dozens of exiguous threads which lead vaguely up towards the centre of the web where the poisonous, motionless creature is lurking. I only mention the Greuze because it brings the matter within the range of your own observation.”"
"“是这样，福尔摩斯先生，我承认您说的这些都很有趣，岂止是有趣而已，应该说是非常精彩。不过，如果可以的话，您最好再说得明白一点儿。他的钱具体是怎么来的，是伪造纸钞、私铸硬币，还是入室抢劫呢？”","“Well, Mr. Holmes, I admit that what you say is interesting: it’s more than interesting—it’s just wonderful. But let us have it a little clearer if you can. Is it forgery, coining, burglary—where does the money come from?”"
"“你读过乔纳森·怀尔德的事迹吗？”","“Have you ever read of Jonathan Wild?”"
"“呃，名字听着倒挺熟的。他是小说里的人物，对吗？小说里的侦探我可不怎么感冒，那些家伙从来都不肯让人看到他们的办案手法。他们办案凭的是一时的灵感，并不是踏踏实实的工作。”","“Well, the name has a familiar sound. Someone in a novel, was he not? I don’t take much stock of detectives in novels— chaps that do things and never let you see how they do them. That’s just inspiration: not business.”"
"“乔纳森·怀尔德并不是侦探，也没有在小说里出现过。此人是上世纪的一个罪魁，生活在一七五○年左右。[^5]”","“Jonathan Wild wasn’t a detective, and he wasn’t in a novel. He was a master criminal, and he lived last century—1750 or thereabouts.”"
"“这么说的话，他对我就没有什么用处，我可是讲求实效的。 ”","“Then he’s no use to me. I’m a practical man.”"
"“麦克先生，你这辈子能做的最有实效的事情就是闭门谢客，踏踏实实地待上三个月，每天花十二个钟头的时间来阅读过往的犯罪记录。所有的事情都会循环出现，就连莫里亚蒂教授这样的人物也是如此。乔纳森·怀尔德是伦敦罪犯的幕后主使，他为他们出谋划策、提供人手，回报则是百分之十五的赃物。时间的轮子周而复始，转下去的辐条还会转上来。所有的事情都有先例，将来也会再次发生。我这就给你讲一两件莫里亚蒂的事情，兴许能引起你的兴趣。”","“Mr. Mac, the most practical thing that you ever did in your life would be to shut yourself up for three months and read twelve hours a day at the annals of crime. Everything comes in circles—even Professor Moriarty. Jonathan Wild was the hidden force of the London criminals, to whom he sold his brains and his organization on a fifteen per cent commission. The old wheel turns, and the same spoke comes up. It’s all been done before, and will be again. I’ll tell you one or two things about Moriarty which may interest you.”"
"“这些事情当然能引起我的兴趣，错不了。 ”","“You’ll interest me, right enough.”"
"“他那根链条，一端是这个走上邪路的拿破仑，另一端是由上百名打手、窃贼、勒索犯、牌桌骗子组成的乌合之众，中间则是应有尽有的罪行，而我碰巧知道，谁才是那根链条当中的第一个环节。他的参谋长是塞巴斯蒂安·莫兰上校，那家伙跟他本人一样置身事外、一样戒备森严、一样让法律鞭长莫及。你知道他给上校多少钱吗？”","“I happen to know who is the first link in his chain—a chain with this Napoleon gone-wrong at one end, and a hundred broken fighting men, pickpockets, blackmailers, and card sharpers at the other, with every sort of crime in between. His chief of staff is Colonel Sebastian Moran, as aloof and guarded and inaccessible to the law as himself. What do you think he pays him?”"
"“我很想听一听。”","“I’d like to hear.”"
"“一年六千镑。你看到了吧，这就叫做‘把钱花在脑瓜子上’，用的是美国人的商业准则。完全是机缘巧合，我才了解到了这个细节。这可比首相的薪水还要高啊。听了这一点，你应该对莫里亚蒂的收入和生意规模有点儿概念了吧。还有一点，最近这段时间，我专门下了一点儿工夫，查到了莫里亚蒂使用的一些支票——不过是他用来支付家庭开销的支票而已，普普通通、合理合法，但却是从六家不同的银行开出来的。这件事情，你觉不觉得蹊跷呢？”","“Six thousand a year. That’s paying for brains, you see—the American business principle. I learned that detail quite by chance. It’s more than the Prime Minister gets. That gives you an idea of Moriarty’s gains and of the scale on which he works. Another point: I made it my business to hunt down some of Moriarty’s checks lately—just common innocent checks that he pays his household bills with. They were drawn on six different banks. Does that make any impression on your mind?”"
"“怪啊，确实是怪！不过，您的结论又是什么呢？”","“Queer, certainly! But what do you gather from it?”"
"“结论是他不希望别人对他的财富说三道四，不想让任何人知道他到底有多少钱。我敢肯定他拥有二十个银行账户，十之八九，他大部分的财产都在国外，都在德意志银行和里昂信贷银行之类的地方。将来，等你有了一两年空闲时间的时候，我建议你好好地研究一下莫里亚蒂教授。”","“That he wanted no gossip about his wealth. No single man should know what he had. I have no doubt that he has twenty banking accounts; the bulk of his fortune abroad in the Deutsche Bank or the Crédit Lyonnais as likely as not. Sometime when you have a year or two to spare I commend to you the study of Professor Moriarty.”"
"对话过程之中，麦克唐纳督察表现得越来越感兴趣，最后就听得入了迷。到这会儿，他那颗讲求实效的苏格兰脑袋“啪”的一声转了个方向，回到了手头的案子上。","Inspector MacDonald had grown steadily more impressed as the conversation proceeded. He had lost himself in his interest. Now his practical Scotch intelligence brought him back with a snap to the matter in hand."
"“不管怎么样，教授的事情可以以后再说，”他说道。“福尔摩斯先生，您这些趣事轶闻已经让咱们偏离了主题。您说了这么多，真正的要害不过是那位教授跟这次的罪行脱不了干系，而您之所以这么说，是因为波洛克这个家伙给您发来了警讯。就眼下的实际需要而言，咱们还能有什么进一步的结论吗？”","“He can keep, anyhow,” said he. “You’ve got us side-tracked with your interesting anecdotes, Mr. Holmes. What really counts is your remark that there is some connection between the professor and the crime. That you get from the warning received through the man Porlock. Can we for our present practical needs get any further than that?”"
"“咱们可以由此推测这起罪案的动机。从你最初的描述来看，这是一起无法解释、至少是尚未得到解释的谋杀案。好了，假设罪行的源头确实符合咱们的推测，犯罪动机就有两种解释。首先我得告诉你，莫里亚蒂对他的党羽实施的是一种铁腕统治。他的戒条十分恐怖，处罚则只有一种，那就是死刑。那么，咱们不妨假定这个死者——也就是这个道格拉斯，他的临头厄运已经传到了魔头帐下一名爪牙的耳朵里——是莫里亚蒂的爪牙，而且以某种方式背叛了自己的首领。处罚随之而来，而且要让所有人知道，目的嘛，兴许只是为了让其他的爪牙看到死亡的恐怖。”","“We may form some conception as to the motives of the crime. It is, as I gather from your original remarks, an inexplicable, or at least an unexplained, murder. Now, presuming that the source of the crime is as we suspect it to be, there might be two different motives. In the first place, I may tell you that Moriarty rules with a rod of iron over his people. His discipline is tremendous. There is only one punishment in his code. It is death. Now we might suppose that this murdered man—this Douglas whose approaching fate was known by one of the arch-criminal’s subordinates—had in some way betrayed the chief. His punishment followed, and would be known to all—if only to put the fear of death into them.”"
"“呃，您只说了一种解释，福尔摩斯先生。”","“Well, that is one suggestion, Mr. Holmes.”"
"“另一种解释就是，这起罪行虽然出自莫里亚蒂的策划，但却只是他日常生意当中的一件。现场有抢劫的迹象吗？”","“The other is that it has been engineered by Moriarty in the ordinary course of business. Was there any robbery?”"
"“这我还没听说。”","“I have not heard.”"
"“当然喽，如果有抢劫迹象的话，第二种解释就比第一种更显得符合情理。那样的话，莫里亚蒂既可能是按照某种分赃协议策划了这起罪案，也可能是预先收到了足够的策划费用。两种情形都有可能。不过，具体是哪一种情形，会不会有第三种情形，咱们只能到伯尔斯通去找答案。我可是非常了解咱们的这个对手，绝不指望他会在伦敦这边留下什么可以追到他头上的线索。”","“If so, it would, of course, be against the first hypothesis and in favour of the second. Moriarty may have been engaged to engineer it on a promise of part spoils, or he may have been paid so much down to manage it. Either is possible. But whichever it may be, or if it is some third combination, it is down at Birlstone that we must seek the solution. I know our man too well to suppose that he has left anything up here which may lead us to him.”"
"“那好，咱们赶紧去伯尔斯通吧！”麦克唐纳嚷了一声，从椅子上一跃而起。“天哪！没想到这么晚了，先生们，我只能给你们五分钟的准备时间，再多就没有啦。”","“Then to Birlstone we must go!” cried MacDonald, jumping from his chair. “My word! it’s later than I thought. I can give you, gentlemen, five minutes for preparation, and that is all.”"
"“这对我俩来说都是绰绰有余，”福尔摩斯说道，跟着就跳起身来，急匆匆地脱下睡袍、换上大衣。“咱们上路之后，麦克先生，我得麻烦你给我讲讲全部的案情。”","“And ample for us both,” said Holmes, as he sprang up and hastened to change from his dressing gown to his coat. “While we are on our way, Mr. Mac, I will ask you to be good enough to tell me all about it.”"
"事实证明，“全部的案情”实在是少得让人大失所望，同时也足以让我们确信，眼前这件案子完全值得这位探案专家最密切的关注。他搓着瘦骨嶙峋的双手，容光焕发地倾听着那些寥寥无几却又非比寻常的案情细节。好多个星期百无聊赖的日子就此结束，我们终于迎来了一个配得上他那些非凡本领的目标。跟所有的特殊禀赋一样，如果没有用武之地，那些本领就会变成主人的烦恼。闲置不用的话，他剃刀一般锋锐的脑子就会变得麻木迟钝、锈迹斑斑。","“All about it” proved to be disappointingly little, and yet there was enough to assure us that the case before us might well be worthy of the expert’s closest attention. He brightened and rubbed his thin hands together as he listened to the meagre but remarkable details. A long series of sterile weeks lay behind us, and here at last there was a fitting object for those remarkable powers which, like all special gifts, become irksome to their owner when they are not in use. That razor brain blunted and rusted with inaction."
"听到了工作的召唤，歇洛克·福尔摩斯两眼发亮，苍白的双颊呈现出了一种更为温暖的色调，整张脸显得十分热切，洋溢着一种由内而外的光彩。他在出租马车的座位上欠身向前，专注地听麦克唐纳概述在萨塞克斯[^6]等待我们的那个难题。据督察自己的解释，他对案情也是所知有限，还得参考别人通过当天清早的牛奶列车[^7]送来的一份潦草记录。麦克唐纳跟萨塞克斯探员怀特·梅森私交不错，这样一来，在当地警方需要苏格兰场协助的时候，他收到消息的速度要比正常的官方渠道快得多。正常情形之下，首都警局的专家得在案发许久之后才能收到请求协助的公函。这一次，他念给我们听的那封信是这么写的：","Sherlock Holmes’s eyes glistened, his pale cheeks took a warmer hue, and his whole eager face shone with an inward light when the call for work reached him. Leaning forward in the cab, he listened intently to MacDonald’s short sketch of the problem which awaited us in Sussex. The inspector was himself dependent, as he explained to us, upon a scribbled account forwarded to him by the milk train in the early hours of the morning. White Mason, the local officer, was a personal friend, and hence MacDonald had been notified much more promptly than is usual at Scotland Yard when provincials need their assistance. It is a very cold scent upon which the Metropolitan expert is generally asked to run."
"> 亲爱的麦克唐纳督察：","> Dear InsPector MacDonalD [said the letter which he read to us]:"
"> 请求贵局协助的正式公文另见专函，这封信仅供你私人过目。请电告你坐早晨的哪班火车前来伯尔斯通，我会到车站去接你——或者派人去接你，如果我脱不开身的话。这可是一件了不得的大案子。你赶紧动身吧，一秒钟也别耽搁。你要能把福尔摩斯先生带来的话，麻烦你务必这么办，这案子肯定能对上他的胃口。要不是死者摆在现场的话，我们简直会觉得整件事情是一场刻意追求轰动效果的舞台剧呢。相信我！这真的是一件了不得的大案子。","> Official requisition for your services is in separate envelope. This is for your private eye. Wire me what train in the morning you can get for Birlstone, and I will meet it—or have it met if I am too occupied. This case is a snorter. Don’t waste a moment in getting started. If you can bring Mr. Holmes, please do so; for he will find something after his own heart. We would think the whole thing had been fixed up for theatrical effect if there wasn’t a dead man in the middle of it. My word! it *is* a snorter."
"“看样子，你这位朋友一点儿也不傻嘛，”福尔摩斯如是评论。","“Your friend seems to be no fool,” remarked Holmes. "
"“不傻，先生，如果我还算有点儿眼光的话，怀特·梅森可是个非常机灵的家伙。”","“No, sir, White Mason is a very live man, if I am any judge.”"
"“好吧，你还知道别的什么情况吗？”","“Well, have you anything more?” "
"“我只知道，咱们跟他见上面的时候，他就会把所有的细节告诉咱们。”","“Only that he will give us every detail when we meet.” "
"“那你怎么知道死者是道格拉斯先生，又怎么知道这是一起惨无人道的谋杀呢？”","“Then how did you get at Mr. Douglas and the fact that he had been horribly murdered?”"
"“这是专函里的正式报告上说的。报告里倒没有‘惨无人道’这个字眼儿，因为这不是一个普遍通行的官方术语。报告给出了约翰·道格拉斯这个名字，说了他伤在头部，凶器是一把霰弹枪，还说了报案的时间是昨天夜里将近十二点。报告里又说，这案子毫无疑问是一起谋杀，目前还没有拘捕任何嫌犯，案子当中有一些非常让人迷惑的离奇细节。目前我们只知道这些，再没有别的了，福尔摩斯先生。”","“That was in the inclosed official report. It didn’t say ‘horrible’: that’s not a recognized official term. It gave the name John Douglas. It mentioned that his injuries had been in the head, from the discharge of a shotgun. It also mentioned the hour of the alarm, which was close on to midnight last night. It added that the case was undoubtedly one of murder, but that no arrest had been made, and that the case was one which presented some very perplexing and extraordinary features. That’s absolutely all we have at present, Mr. Holmes.”"
"“既然如此，麦克先生，你不反对的话，咱们的讨论不妨到此为止。资料不够的时候，咱们可不能急急忙忙地拿出假设，这是咱们这一行的大忌。到目前为止，我能确定的只有两样东西，一样是待在伦敦的一颗聪明脑袋，另一样是躺在萨塞克斯的一名死者。两样东西之间的因果链条，便是咱们此行的追查目标。”","“Then, with your permission, we will leave it at that, Mr. Mac. The temptation to form premature theories upon insufficient data is the bane of our profession. I can see only two things for certain at present—a great brain in London, and a dead man in Sussex. It’s the chain between that we are going to trace.”"
"伯尔斯通惨剧","The Tragedy of Birlstone"
"故事讲到这里，我得向读者诸君告个假，暂时让我自己饰演的卑微角色从情节当中消失，转而叙述我们到达凶案现场之前的种种事件，叙述的依据则是我们后来才了解到的一些情况。只有通过这种办法，我才能让读者们看清涉入此案的各个人物，看清决定他们命运的那个离奇背景。","Now for a moment I will ask leave to remove my own insignificant personality and to describe events which occurred before we arrived upon the scene by the light of knowledge which came to us afterwards. Only in this way can I make the reader appreciate the people concerned and the strange setting in which their fate was cast."
"伯尔斯通是萨塞克斯郡北端一个历史悠久的小小村落，村里只有一些砖木结构的农舍。它一成不变地度过了几百年的岁月，前些年才凭借如画的风景和优越的地理位置引来了不少富裕的住户，村子周围的林地之中也才有了这些住户建起的一座座别墅。广袤的“大林地”[^1]向着北部的白垩山丘延伸，越是往北，林木越是稀疏。按照当地人的看法，伯尔斯通的林地正是“大林地”最靠北的边缘部分。人口增多之后，各式各样的小商铺应运而生，由此看来，伯尔斯通很快就会从一个古老的村落演变成一个现代化的城镇。伯尔斯通是周围一大片乡区的神经中枢，原因在于，离它最近的重要城镇也得到十至十二英里之外的地方去找，那个城镇就是它东边的坦布里奇韦尔斯，已经进入了肯特郡的地界[^2]。","The village of Birlstone is a small and very ancient cluster of half-timbered cottages on the northern border of the county of Sussex. For centuries it had remained unchanged; but within the last few years its picturesque appearance and situation have attracted a number of well-to-do residents, whose villas peep out from the woods around. These woods are locally supposed to be the extreme fringe of the great Weald forest, which thins away until it reaches the northern chalk downs. A number of small shops have come into being to meet the wants of the increased populat ion; so there seems some prospect that Birlstone may soon grow from an ancient village into a modern town. It is the centre for a considerable area of country, since Tunbridge Wells, the nearest place of importance, is ten or twelve miles to the eastward, over the borders of Kent."
"离村子半英里左右的地方有一片以巨型山毛榉树闻名的古老庭园，庭园之中矗立着源远流长的伯尔斯通宅邸。这座气度端严的建筑有一部分可以追溯到第一次十字军东征时期，那时候，“红王”将这片土地赏给了雨果·德·卡皮，后者就在土地的中央建起了一座城堡。卡皮的城堡在1543 年付之一炬，到了詹姆斯一世时代，有人又在这座封建城堡的废墟之上建起了一座砖砌的乡间宅邸，还把那些熏得黢黑的基石用了起来。[^3]","About half a mile from the town, standing in an old park famous for its huge beech trees, is the ancient Manor House of Birlstone. Part of this venerable building dates back to the time of the first crusade, when Hugo de Capus built a fortalice in the centre of the estate, which had been granted to him by the Red King. This was destroyed by fire in 1543, and some of its smoke-blackened corner stones were used when, in Jacobean times, a brick country house rose upon the ruins of the feudal castle."
"山墙林立的宅子装的是菱形窗格的小玻璃窗，很大程度上还保留着十七世纪早期刚刚落成时的模样。宅子周围有两圈城壕，曾经为宅子那个更为军事化的前身提供了屏障。外面的一圈已经自然干涸，眼下扮演的是菜园子这个卑微平凡的角色。里面的一圈则依然存在，包围着整座宅子，深度虽然已经下降到了区区几英尺，宽度却足足有四十英尺。城壕里的水来自一条穿壕而过的小河，虽然说混浊不堪，但却与普通的沟中死水绝不相同，并不会危及健康。宅子底楼的窗子离水面还不到一英尺。","The Manor House, with its many gables and its small diamond paned windows, was still much as the builder had left it in the early seventeenth century. Of the double moats which had guarded its more warlike predecessor, the outer had been allowed to dry up, and served the humble function of a kitchen garden. The inner one was still there, and lay forty feet in breadth, though now only a few feet in depth, round the whole house. A small stream fed it and continued beyond it, so that the sheet of water, though turbid, was never ditchlike or unhealthy. The ground floor windows were within a foot of the surface of the water."
"进入宅子的唯一一条通道是一座吊桥，吊桥的铁链和绞盘早就已经锈蚀断裂。不过，宅邸的新主人已经凭着惯有的干劲把吊桥修复如初，到眼下，吊桥不光是拉得起来，每天晚上也实实在在地拉了起来，要到第二天早上才会放下去。这一来，宅子又恢复了封建时代的旧貌，一到晚上就会变成一座孤岛——这样的一个事实，对即将轰动全英的那件谜案造成了十分直接的影响。","The only approach to the house was over a drawbridge, the chains and windlass of which had long been rusted and broken. The latest tenants of the Manor House had, however, with characteristic energy, set this right, and the drawbridge was not only capable of being raised, but actually was raised every evening and lowered every morning. By thus renewing the custom of the old feudal days the Manor House was converted into an island during the night—a fact which had a very direct bearing upon the mystery which was soon to engage the attention of all England."
"道格拉斯一家入主宅邸的时候，宅邸已经荒废多年，眼看着就要土崩瓦解，变成一堆惊心怵目的断壁残垣。这家人只有两个成员，一个是约翰·道格拉斯，另一个就是他的妻子。道格拉斯是个外表和性格都不一般的人物，他年纪五十上下，下巴宽大、面容粗犷、髭须花白，灰色的眼睛极其锐利，瘦削结实的身板充满活力，分毫不少地保持着年轻时代的强健和机敏。他在所有人面前都是兴高采烈、一团和气，举止却多少有点儿唐突简慢，给人的印象是他曾经体验过另一个阶层的生活，那个阶层的社会等级要比萨塞克斯乡绅低得多。","The house had been untenanted for some years and was threatening to moulder into a picturesque decay when the Douglases took possession of it. This family consisted of only two individuals John Douglas and his wife. Douglas was a remarkable man, both in character and in person. In age he may have been about fifty, with a strong jawed, rugged face, a grizzling moustache, peculiarly keen gray eyes, and a wiry, vigorous figure which had lost nothing of the strength and activity of youth. He was cheery and genial to all, but somewhat offhand in his manners, giving the impression that he had seen life in social strata on some far lower horizon than the county society of Sussex."
"然而，尽管那些较为文雅的邻居看他的眼神里透着一点儿惊讶和不以为然，他还是迅速赢得了村民们的热爱，因为他出手阔绰地支持村里的所有公益事业，积极参加吸烟音乐会[^4]之类的社交活动，同时又拥有一副异常浑厚的男高音，随时乐意用一首十分悦耳的歌曲为参加聚会的人们助兴。他似乎非常有钱，钱据说是从加利福尼亚的金矿里赚来的，从他和他妻子的言谈来看，他确实是在美国生活过一段时间。","Yet, though looked at with some curiosity and reserve by his more cultivated neighbours, he soon acquired a great popularity among the villagers, subscribing handsomely to all local objects, and attending their smoking concerts and other functions, where, having a remarkably rich tenor voice, he was always ready to oblige with an excellent song. He appeared to have plenty of money, which was said to have been gained in the California gold fields, and it was clear from his own talk and that of his wife that he had spent a part of his life in America."
"他慷慨大方的秉性和平易近人的做派已经赢得了人们的好感，履险如夷的胆色则让他声望倍添。他的骑术十分蹩脚，可他却一次不落地参加了所有的赛马会，并且打定主意要跟最好的骑手比个高低，不顾自己一次又一次地摔得落花流水。教区牧师家里着火的时候，他也表现出了过人的勇气，因为当地的救火队已经无计可施、放弃扑救，他却毫无惧色地再一次冲进房子去抢救财物。这样一来，迁居伯尔斯通还不到五年，宅邸主人约翰·道格拉斯就已经变成了一个响当当的人物。","The good impression which had been produced by his generosity and by his democratic manners was increased by a reputation gained for utter indifference to danger. Though a wretched rider, he turned out at every meet and took the most amazing falls in his determination to hold his own with the best. When the vicarage caught fire he distinguished himself also by the fearlessness with which he reëntered the building to save property, after the local fire brigade had given it up as impossible. Thus it came about that John Douglas of the Manor House had within five years won himself quite a reputation in Birlstone."
"道格拉斯的妻子也很受各位相识的欢迎，当然，她的相识并不多，因为按照英格兰人的习俗，很少有人会在未经正式引见的情形之下去拜访迁居本郡的外乡人。她对此不以为意，因为她天性恬退，与此同时，从方方面面的情况来看，她心里只有丈夫和家务。根据大家的了解，她出身于英格兰良家，是在伦敦与时为鳏夫的道格拉斯先生相识的。她长得非常漂亮，身材修长、肤色较深，年纪则比她丈夫小了二十岁左右。不过，悬殊的年龄似乎并没有对夫妻俩和和美美的家庭生活造成丝毫影响。","His wife, too, was popular with those who had made her acquaintance; though, after the English fashion, the callers upon a stranger who settled in the county without introductions were few and far between. This mattered the less to her, as she was retiring by disposition, and very much absorbed, to all appearance, in her husband and her domestic duties. It was known that she was an English lady who had met Mr. Douglas in London, he being at that time a widower. She was a beautiful woman, tall, dark, and slender, some twenty years younger than her husband; a disparity which seemed in no wise to mar the contentment of their family life."
"不过，有些时候，跟这对夫妻走得最近的人们会说，他俩之间似乎并没有完全的信任。做妻子的很少谈论丈夫的过去，这可能是因为她主动选择守口如瓶，更大的可能则是她本来就对丈夫的过去不甚了了。除此之外，道格拉斯太太有时会显得十分紧张，赶上丈夫回家特别晚的时候，她更会流露出极为强烈的不安，这些情况也让一些目光敏锐的人看在了眼里、挂在了嘴上。在这种宁静安闲的乡村地区，闲言碎语总是格外受人欢迎，宅邸女主人的这种怪癖自然逃不过人们的议论。后来的种种事件让她的怪癖有了一层十分特殊的含意，到那个时候，关于她这种怪癖的记忆便格外清晰地浮现在了人们的脑海之中。","It was remarked sometimes, however, by those who knew them best, that the confidence between the two did not appear to be complete, since the wife was either very reticent about her husband’s past life, or else, as seemed more likely, was imperfectly informed about it. It had also been noted and commented upon by a few observant people that there were signs sometimes of some nerve-strain upon the part of Mrs. Douglas, and that she would display acute uneasiness if her absent husband should ever be particularly late in his return. On a quiet countryside, where all gossip is welcome, this weakness of the lady of the Manor House did not pass without remark, and it bulked larger upon people’s memory when the events arose which gave it a very special significance."
"还有个人需要提一提，他虽然只是个来来往往的过客，并不在宅邸之中长住，可他来的时候刚好赶上了下文之中的离奇事件，结果就让自己的名字赫然出现在了公众眼前。这个人就是塞西尔·詹姆斯·巴克，住在汉普斯蒂德街区[^5]的黑尔斯公寓。","There was yet another individual whose residence under that roof was, it is true, only an intermittent one, but whose presence at the time of the strange happenings which will now be narrated brought his name prominently before the public. This was Cecil James Barker, of Hales Lodge, Hampstead."
"塞西尔·巴克那个晃晃悠悠的高大身影是伯尔斯通村那条主要街道上的常见风景，因为他经常来伯尔斯通宅邸做客，而且很受主人的欢迎。人们对他格外留意，因为他一方面是道格拉斯先生在那段不为人知的往昔岁月当中结交的朋友，一方面又是道格拉斯先生英格兰新生活当中的一个成员，同时具备这两种身份的人只有他一个。巴克本人无疑是英格兰的土产，不过，他自己说得非常清楚，他是在美国认识道格拉斯的，他俩在那边有过十分亲密的交往。他似乎非常富裕，据说还是个单身汉。","Cecil Barker’s tall, loose-jointed figure was a familiar one in the main street of Birlstone village; for he was a frequent and welcome visitor at the Manor House. He was the more noticed as being the only friend of the past unknown life of Mr. Douglas who was ever seen in his new English surroundings. Barker was himself an undoubted Englishman; but by his remarks it was clear that he had first known Douglas in America and had there lived on intimate terms with him. He appeared to be a man of considerable wealth, and was reputed to be a bachelor."
"巴克比道格拉斯先生年轻不少，充其量不过四十五岁。他身材高大挺拔，胸膛宽阔，刮得干干净净的脸活像个职业拳手，乌黑的双眉浓密劲挺，一双黑色的眼睛咄咄逼人。瞧他那双眼睛，他兴许不需要强悍双手的帮助，单凭目光就可以在敌视自己的人群当中清出一条路来。他既不骑马也不打猎，成天都叼着烟斗在古老的村子周围晃荡，或者是跟主人一起坐着马车欣赏美丽的乡野，主人不在就跟女主人一起出游。“他是一位脾气随和、出手阔绰的绅士，”宅邸管家埃姆斯如是评论。“不过，说真的！我可不敢惹他动火！”他跟道格拉斯非常亲密，对待道格拉斯太太的态度也是同样友善，友善得不止一次引起了道格拉斯的明显不快，就连仆人们都看得出来。灾难降临的时候，这家人当中的第三个成员就是这么一个人物。","In age he was rather younger than Douglas—forty-five at the most—a tall, straight, broad-chested fellow with a clean-shaved, prize-fighter face, thick, strong, black eyebrows, and a pair of masterful black eyes which might, even without the aid of his very capable hands, clear a way for him through a hostile crowd. He neither rode nor shot, but spent his days in wandering round the old village with his pipe in his mouth, or in driving with his host, or in his absence with his hostess, over the beautiful countryside. “An easy-going, free-handed gentleman,” said Ames, the butler. “But, my word! I had rather not be the man that crossed him!” He was cordial and intimate with Douglas, and he was no less friendly with his wife—a friendship which more than once seemed to cause some irritation to the husband, so that even the servants were able to perceive his annoyance. Such was the third person who was one of the family when the catastrophe occurred."
"说到这座古老建筑当中的其他住客嘛，住客虽然不少，提一提其中两个也就够了，一个是庄重体面、治家有方的埃姆斯，另一个则是体态丰腴、开朗乐观的艾伦太太，她帮道格拉斯太太分担了不少家务。除开他俩之外，宅子里还有六名仆人，不过，那些仆人都跟一月六号夜间的种种事件没有什么关系。","As to the other denizens of the old building, it will suffice out of a large household to mention the prim, respectable, and capable Ames, and Mrs. Allen, a buxom and cheerful person, who relieved the lady of some of her household cares. The other six servants in the house bear no relation to the events of the night of January 6th."
"伯尔斯通当地的小警局是在当晚十一点三刻接到报案的，值班的人是萨塞克斯警队的威尔逊警长。当时，塞西尔·巴克火急火燎地冲到警局门口，疯了似的把门铃拉得山响。他上气不接下气地说了一大通，要点则是伯尔斯通宅邸发生了可怕的惨剧，约翰·道格拉斯遭到了谋杀。说完之后，巴克急匆匆地赶回了宅邸，警长则立刻将大案发生的消息发往郡里的警局，几分钟之内就跟了过去，赶到凶案现场的时间是十二点多一点儿。","It was at eleven forty-five that the first alarm reached the small local police station, in charge of Sergeant Wilson of the Sussex Constabulary. Cecil Barker, much excited, had rushed up to the door and pealed furiously upon the bell. A terrible tragedy had occurred at the Manor House, and John Douglas had been murdered. That was the breathless burden of his message. He had hurried back to the house, followed within a few minutes by the police sergeant, who arrived at the scene of the crime a little after twelve o’clock, after taking prompt steps to warn the county authorities that something serious was afoot."
"赶到宅邸的时候，警长发现吊桥已经放下，窗子里灯火通明，所有的人都惊惶失措，乱成了一锅粥。仆人们在大厅里挤作一团，一个个脸色惨白，惊骇不已的管家则在门厅里绞着自己的双手。仍然能够保持自控的似乎只有塞西尔·巴克；他已经打开了离入口最近的那道门，示意警长跟他一起去看现场。与此同时，手脚麻利、医术高明的全科医师伍德也从村里赶到了伯尔斯通宅邸。他们三个一起走进了发生凶案的那个房间，惊恐万状的管家也跟了进去，并且随手关上了房门，免得女仆们看到房间里的可怕景象。","On reaching the Manor House, the sergeant had found the drawbridge down, the windows lighted up, and the whole household in a state of wild confusion and alarm. The white-faced servants were huddling together in the hall, with the frightened butler wringing his hands in the doorway. Only Cecil Barker seemed to be master of himself and his emotions; he had opened the door which was nearest to the entrance and he had beckoned to the sergeant to follow him. At that moment there arrived Dr. Wood, a brisk and capable general practitioner from the village. The three men entered the fatal room together, while the horror-stricken butler followed at their heels, closing the door behind him to shut out the terrible scene from the maid servants."
"死者仰面躺在房间中央，四肢摊开，身上只穿了一套睡衣，外面罩着一件粉色的睡袍，脚上没穿袜子，趿拉着一双绒面拖鞋。医生跪到死者身边，把桌上的提灯拿下来照了照。一眼看过去，医生就知道自己已经回天乏术。死者伤得惨不忍睹，横在他胸膛上的是一件奇特的武器。那是一把双筒霰弹枪，扳机前方的枪管被锯掉了一英尺。显而易见，凶手开火的距离非常近，所有的弹药结结实实地倾泻到了死者的脸上，几乎把他的脑袋炸成了碎片。凶手还用铁丝把两个扳机绑在了一起，目的正是让两筒弹药同时发射，造成更大的杀伤效果。","The dead man lay on his back, sprawling with outstretched limbs in the centre of the room. He was clad only in a pink dressing gown, which covered his night clothes. There were carpet slippers on his bare feet. The doctor knelt beside him and held down the hand lamp which had stood on the table. One glance at the victim was enough to show the healer that his presence could be dispensed with. The man had been horribly injured. Lying across his chest was a curious weapon, a shotgun with the barrel sawed off a foot in front of the triggers. It was clear that this had been fired at close range and that he had received the whole charge in the face, blowing his head almost to pieces. The triggers had been wired together, so as to make the simultaneous discharge more destructive."
"面对这份突如其来的重大责任，乡村警员觉得惶惑不安。“咱们什么也别动，等我的上级来吧，”他惊骇地紧盯着形容可怖的死者，压低嗓门儿说了一句。","The country policeman was unnerved and troubled by the tremendous responsibility which had come so suddenly upon him. “We will touch nothing until my superiors arrive,” he said in a hushed voice, staring in horror at the dreadful head."
"“我们什么都没动过，”塞西尔·巴克说道。“这一点我可以保证。您看到的情形跟我刚发现的时候一模一样。”","“Nothing has been touched up to now,” said Cecil  Barker. “I’ll answer for that. You see it all exactly as I found it.”"
"“您是什么时候发现的呢？”警长已经把自己的记事本掏了出来。","“When was that?” The sergeant had drawn out his notebook."
"“刚好是十一点半的时候。听到枪声的时候，我坐在自个儿卧室的壁炉旁边，还没有脱衣上床。枪声并不是特别响，听着像是被什么捂住了似的。我赶紧冲下楼来，依我看，最多不过半分钟，我已经冲进了这个房间。”","“It was just half-past eleven. I had not begun to undress, and I was sitting by the fire in my bedroom when I heard the report. It was not very loud—it seemed to be muffled. I rushed down—I don’t suppose it was thirty seconds before I was in the room.”"
"“这道门当时开着吗？”","“Was the door open?”"
"“是的，门是开着的。可怜的道格拉斯就躺在眼下的这个位置，他从自个儿卧室里拿来的蜡烛还在桌子上燃烧。过了几分钟，我才把这盏提灯点上。”","“Yes, it was open. Poor Douglas was lying as you see him. His bedroom candle was burning on the table. It was I who lit the lamp some minutes afterward.”"
"“您没有看见什么人吗？”","“Did you see no one?”"
"“没有。我听见道格拉斯太太跟着我下了楼，便赶紧冲出去拦她，免得她看见这种可怕的景象。女管家艾伦太太跑了过来，搀着她离开了。埃姆斯已经到场，我们俩就一起跑回了这个房间。”","“No. I heard Mrs. Douglas coming down the stair behind me, and I rushed out to prevent her from seeing this dreadful sight. Mrs. Allen, the housekeeper, came and took her away. Ames had arrived, and we ran back into the room once more.”"
"“可我确实听说，吊桥整夜都是收在上面的。”","“But surely I have heard that the drawbridge is kept up all night.”"
"“没错，的确收在上面，是我后来把它放下去的。”","“Yes, it was up until I lowered it.”"
"“这么说的话，凶手怎么跑得掉呢？根本就不可能嘛！道格拉斯先生肯定是自杀的。”","“Then how could any murderer have got away? It is out of the question! Mr. Douglas must have shot himself.”"
"“刚开始的时候，我们也是这么想的。可是您瞧！”巴克拉开窗帘，窗帘后面那扇狭长的菱形格子窗已经开到了最大的限度。“再瞧瞧这个！”他用提灯照了照，木头窗台上有一块形如靴印的血迹。“有人从窗子往外逃，所以才踩到了这上面。”","“That was our first idea. But see!” Barker drew aside the curtain, and showed that the long, diamond-paned window was open to its full extent. “And look at this!” He held the lamp down and illuminated a smudge of blood like the mark of a boot-sole upon the wooden sill. “Someone has stood there in getting out.”"
"“您是说有人趟过城壕跑掉了吗？”","“You mean that someone waded across the moat?”"
"“没错！”","“Exactly!”"
"“可是，既然您案发之后不到半分钟就跑进了这个房间，肯定能看到他在水里啊。 ”","“Then if you were in the room within half a minute of the crime, he must have been in the water at that very moment.”"
"“肯定能看到。老天在上，我要是一进来就往窗子跟前冲就好了！可是，您也看见了，窗子上还拉着窗帘呢，所以我压根儿就没往这上面想。接着我就听见了道格拉斯太太的脚步声，一心只想着不能让她走进这个房间。这里面的景象确实是太惨了。”","“I have not a doubt of it. I wish to heaven that I had rushed to the window! But the curtain screened it, as you can see, and so it never occurred to me. Then I heard the step of Mrs. Douglas, and I could not let her enter the room. It would have been too horrible.”"
"“是够惨的！”医生接口说道，眼睛看着那颗粉碎的脑袋和脑袋周围的可怖印迹。“自从伯尔斯通火车相撞事件以来，我还没见过这么可怕的伤情呢。”","“Horrible enough!” said the doctor, looking at the shattered head and the terrible marks which surrounded it. “I’ve never seen such injuries since the Birlstone railway smash.”"
"“慢着，听我说，”警长说道，他那个乡村风格的迟钝头脑仍然在围着那扇敞开的窗子打转。“您当然可以说有人趟过城壕跑掉了，可我倒想问问您，既然吊桥收在上面，当初他究竟是怎么进来的呢？”","“But, I say,” remarked the police sergeant, whose slow, bucolic common sense was still pondering the open window. “It’s all very well your saying that a man escaped by wading this moat, but what I ask you is, how did he ever get into the house at all if the bridge was up?”"
"“呃，这还真是让您给问着了，”巴克说道。","“Ah, that’s the question,” said Barker."
"“吊桥是什么时间收上去的呢？”","“At what o’clock was it raised?”"
"“将近六点的时候，”管家埃姆斯说道。","“It was nearly six o’clock,” said Ames, the butler."
"“我听说，”警长说道，“你们通常都是在太阳落山的时候收吊桥。眼下这个时节，太阳应该是在四点半左右落山，可不会等到将近六点。”","“I’ve heard,” said the sergeant, “that it was usually raised at sunset. That would be nearer half-past four than six at this time of year.”"
"“道格拉斯太太请了一些客人来喝茶，”埃姆斯说道。“客人不走我是不能收吊桥的。他们走了以后，我亲手把吊桥拉了起来。”","“Mrs. Douglas had visitors to tea,” said Ames. “I couldn’t raise it until they went. Then I wound it up myself.”"
"“既然如此，咱们可以这么说，”警长说道，“如果有人从外面进来的话，我是说如果，那么，这个人必须得在六点之前通过吊桥，然后还得在宅子里躲到十一点钟以后，直到道格拉斯先生走进这个房间为止。”","“Then it comes to this,” said the sergeant: “If anyone came from outside—*if* they did—they must have got in across the bridge before six and been in hiding ever since, until Mr. Douglas came into the room after eleven.”"
"“一点儿不错！每天晚上睡觉之前，道格拉斯先生做的最后一件事就是把宅子巡查一遍，看看各处的灯火是否正常。他巡查到这个房间的时候，等在房间里的凶手冲他开了枪，然后就从窗子逃了出去，把枪留在了这儿。我只能这么解释，因为其他的解释都跟事实对不上。”","“That is so! Mr. Douglas went round the house every night the last thing before he turned in to see that the lights were right. That brought him in here. The man was waiting and shot him. Then he got away through the window and left his gun behind him. That’s how I read it; for nothing else will fit the facts.”"
"警长从死者身边的地板上捡起了一张卡片，卡片上有两行十分潦草的墨水字迹，上面一行是字母缩写“V. V.”，下面一行是数字“341”。","The sergeant picked up a card which lay beside the dead man on the floor. The initials V. V. and under them the number 341 were rudely scrawled in ink upon it."
"“这是什么东西？”他举着卡片问道。","“What’s this?” he asked, holding it up."
"巴克好奇地看了看。“之前我还真没注意到这张卡片，”他说道。“肯定是凶手留下的吧。”","Barker looked at it with curiosity. “I never noticed it before,” he said. “The murderer must have left it behind him.”"
"“V. V.——341。我完全想不出这是什么意思。”警长的一双大手把卡片翻来翻去。“‘V. V.’是什么意思呢？某个人的姓名缩写，也许吧。您在那边找到什么了呢，伍德医生？”","“V. V.—341. I can make no sense of that.” The sergeant kept turning it over in his big fingers. “What’s V. V.? Somebody’s initials, maybe. What have you got there, Dr. Wood?”"
"医生在壁炉跟前的毯子上找到了一把大号的锤子，分量十足、工艺精湛。看到锤子之后，塞西尔·巴克指了指壁炉台上的一盒铜头钉。","It was a good-sized hammer which had been lying on the rug in front of the fireplace—a substantial, workmanlike hammer. Cecil Barker pointed to a box of brass-headed nails upon the mantelpiece."
"“就在昨天，道格拉斯先生把墙上的画挪了挪位置，”他说道。“我亲眼看见他站在那把椅子上，把椅子上方的那幅大画往墙上钉。锤子就是这么来的。”","“Mr. Douglas was altering the pictures yesterday,” he said. “I saw him myself, standing upon that chair and fixing the big picture above it. That accounts for the hammer.”"
"“咱们最好把它放回毯子上的原位吧，”警长一边说，一边迷惑不解地抓挠自己的脑袋。“要把这件事情查个水落石出，恐怕得用上警队里最好使的脑瓜子。伦敦的专家不来，这案子是结不了的。”说到这里，他举起提灯，慢慢地在房里走了一圈儿。“嘿！”他突然把窗帘扒拉到一边，兴奋不已地嚷了一声。“宅子里的窗帘是什么时候拉上的呢？”","“We’d best put it back on the rug where we found it,” said the sergeant, scratching his puzzled head in his perplexity. “It will want the best brains in the force to get to the bottom of this thing. It will be a London job before it is finished.” He raised the hand lamp and walked slowly round the room. “Hullo!” he cried, excitedly, drawing the window curtain to one side. “What o’clock were those curtains drawn?”"
"“掌灯的时候，”管家说道。“应该是四点刚过不久。”","“When the lamps were lit,” said the butler. “It would be shortly after four.”"
"“之前确实有人躲在这儿，错不了。”警长把提灯移向地面，墙角里有几个清清楚楚的泥巴靴印。“我不得不承认，巴克先生，这跟您的推测完全吻合。看情形，这个人闯进宅子的时间是在四点钟拉上窗帘之后，同时又在六点钟收起吊桥之前。他躲进了这个房间，因为这是他看到的第一个房间。房间里没有藏人的地方，所以他钻到了这道帘子后面。这些事实似乎都很清楚。他主要的目的兴许是偷东西，没想到让道格拉斯先生给撞见了，于是他杀死了道格拉斯先生，然后就逃之夭夭。 ”","“Someone had been hiding here, sure enough.” He held down the light, and the marks of muddy boots were very visible in the corner. “I’m bound to say this bears out your theory, Mr. Barker. It looks as if the man got into the house after four when the curtains were drawn, and before six when the bridge was raised. He slipped into this room, because it was the first that he saw. There was no other place where he could hide, so he popped in behind this curtain. That all seems clear enough. It is likely that his main idea was to burgle the house; but Mr. Douglas chanced to come upon him, so he murdered him and escaped.”"
"“我也是这么看的，”巴克说道。“不过，要我说，咱们这不是白白浪费宝贵的时间吗？咱们干吗不趁着这个家伙还没跑远，把周围的乡区搜查一遍呢？”","“That’s how I read it,” said Barker. “But I say, aren’t we wasting precious time? Couldn’t we start out and scour the country before the fellow gets away?”"
"警长思索了片刻。","The sergeant considered for a moment."
"“早上六点之前是没有火车的，他不可能坐火车逃走。他要是拖着滴答淌水的双腿走大路的话，肯定会引起别人的注意。不管怎么说，没有人来接手的话，我是绝对不能离开这儿的。还有啊，照我看，在我们把眼下的情形全都弄清楚之前，你们也通通不能离开。 ”","“There are no trains before six in the morning; so he can’t get away by rail. If he goes by road with his legs all dripping, it’s odds that someone will notice him. Anyhow, I can’t leave here myself until I am relieved. But I think none of you should go until we see more clearly how we all stand.” "
"医生已经把提灯拿了过去，这会儿正在近距离地验看尸体。“这个记号是怎么回事？”他问道。“它会跟这桩罪行有什么关联吗？”","The doctor had taken the lamp and was narrowly scrutinizing the body. “What’s this mark?” he asked. “Could this have any connection with the crime?”"
"死者的右臂从睡袍里支棱出来，手肘以下的部位露在了外面。靠近前臂中央的位置有一个古怪的褐色标记，图案是一个圆圈套着一个三角形。标记像浮雕一般从牛脂色的胳膊上凸了起来，看上去格外扎眼。","The dead man’s right arm was thrust out from his dressing gown, and exposed as high as the elbow. About halfway up the forearm was a curious brown design, a triangle inside a circle, standing out in vivid relief upon the lard-coloured skin."
"“这可不是刺上去的，”医生一边说，一边眯缝起眼睛，透过眼镜仔细察看，“我从来没见过这样的记号。这个标记肯定是以前的某个时候烙上去的，手法跟烙牲口一样。这是什么意思呢？”","“It’s not tattooed,” said the doctor, peering through his glasses. “I never saw anything like it. The man has been branded at some time as they brand cattle. What is the meaning of this?”"
"“是什么意思我倒说不好，”塞西尔·巴克说道，“不过，过去这十年当中，道格拉斯身上的这个标记我看见过好多次。”","“I don’t profess to know the meaning of it,” said Cecil Barker, “but I have seen the mark on Douglas many times this last ten years.”"
"“我也是，”管家说道。“这个标记我看见过很多次，都是在东家卷起袖管的时候。以前我经常都在琢磨，这到底是什么意思。”","“And so have I,” said the butler. “Many a time when the master has rolled up his sleeves I have noticed that very mark. I’ve often wondered what it could be.”"
"“这么说的话，它跟这桩罪行怎么也扯不上关系，”警长说道。“话说回来，这终归是一件非常古怪的事情。这件案子当中的事情全都非常古怪。我说，这又是怎么啦？”","“Then it has nothing to do with the crime, anyhow,” said the sergeant. “But it’s a rum thing all the same. Everything about this case is rum. Well, what is it now?”"
"管家刚刚发出了一声惊叫，这会儿正指着死者那只伸得长长的手。","The butler had given an exclamation of astonishment and was pointing at the dead man’s outstretched hand."
"“他们拿走了他的结婚戒指！”他倒吸了一口凉气。","“They’ve taken his wedding ring!” he gasped."
"“什么！”","“What!”"
"“真的，错不了。东家一直都把素面的金结婚戒指戴在左手的小指上，再把镶有天然块金的那枚戒指戴在结婚戒指的上面，盘蛇形状的戒指则戴在中指上。眼下呢，块金戒指和盘蛇戒指都还在，结婚戒指却不见了。”","“Yes, indeed. Master always wore his plain gold wedding ring on the little finger of his left hand. That ring with the rough nugget on it was above it, and the twisted snake ring on the third finger. There’s the nugget and there’s the snake, but the wedding ring is gone.”"
"“他说得没错，”巴克说道。","“He’s right,” said Barker."
"“你难道是说，”警长说道，“结婚戒指在另一枚戒指下面吗？”","“Do you tell me,” said the sergeant, “that the wedding ring was *below* the other?”"
"“一直都在！”","“Always!”"
"“也就是说，这个凶手，或者是别的什么人，先把你说的块金戒指取了下来，再把结婚戒指取了下来，然后又把块金戒指套了回去。”","“Then the murderer, or whoever it was, first took off this ring you call the nugget then the wedding ring, and afterwards put the nugget ring back again.”"
"“就是这样！”","“That is so!”"
"可敬的乡村警员开始大摇其头。“要我看，我们必须得让伦敦方面来接手这件案子，越快越好，”他说道。“怀特·梅森是个聪明人，本地还没出过怀特·梅森办不了的案子呢。要不了多久，他就会到这儿来帮我们。可我还是觉得，没有伦敦方面的帮助，这件事情完不了。不管怎么样，说出来也不怕你们笑话，对于我这样的人来说，这件活计真的是太复杂啦。”","The worthy country policeman shook his head. “Seems to me the sooner we get London on to this case the better,” said he. “White Mason is a smart man. No local job has ever been too much for White Mason. It won’t be long now before he is here to help us. But I expect we’ll have to look to London before we are through. Anyhow, I’m not ashamed to say that it is a deal too thick for the likes of me.”"
