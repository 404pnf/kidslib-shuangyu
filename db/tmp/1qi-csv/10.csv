"第一部","PART I "
"这部纪事中所叙述的不同寻常的事件发生在20世纪40年代某一年的奥兰城。由于这些事件有些特别，大家都认为它们与这座城市简直格格不入。奥兰给人的第一印象就是它的普通，只是一个法属阿尔及利亚沿海的大港口及省会罢了。","The unusual events described in this chronicle occurred in 194- at Oran.Everyone agreed that, considering their somewhat extraordinary character, they were out of place there.For its ordinariness is what strikes one first about the town of Oran, which is merely a large French port on the Algerian coast, headquarters of the Prefect of a French Department."
"必须承认的是，这个城市本身是丑陋的。它有着一副自满、平静的外表，需要花些时间才能发现它与世界其他众多商业城市之间有何不同之处。怎样才能想象出这样一幅画面，比如说，一个没有鸽子、没有树木和花园的城市，一个从未有过鸟儿展翅或树叶沙沙响的城市——总之，一个毫无特点的地方？只有通过天空，才能辨认这里的一年四季。带来春天讯息的只有那清新的空气，或是小贩们从郊区运来的一篮篮鲜花。这里的春天是在市场里叫卖的。夏天，太阳炙烤着房子，墙壁上布满了灰色的尘埃，人们只有放下百叶窗，呆在屋里，才能熬过那些炎热的日子。但是，秋天却大雨滂沱、满地泥泞。只有冬天的天气着实不错。","The town itself, let us admit, is ugly.It has a smug, placid air and you need time to discover what it is that makes it different from so many business centers in other parts of the world.How to conjure up a picture, for instance, of a town without pigeons, without any trees or gardens, where you never hear the beat of wings or the rustle of leaves—a thoroughly negative place, in short?The seasons are discriminated only in the sky.All that tells you of spring’s coming is the feel of the air, or the baskets of flowers brought in from the suburbs by peddlers; it’s a spring cried in the marketplaces.During the summer the sun bakes the houses bone-dry, sprinkles our walls with grayish dust, and you have no option but to survive those days of fire indoors, behind closed shutters.In autumn, on the other hand, we have deluges of mud.Only winter brings really pleasant weather."
"或许，了解一个城市最便捷的方式可能就是探察这个城里的人们怎么工作，怎么相爱，怎么死去。在我们这个小城里（不知是否是气候的影响），这三种活动全都是狂热而又随意地进行着。事实上，每个人都感到厌烦，但又尽力培养一些生活习惯。我们的老百姓们努力工作，但只是为了发财。他们对商业最感兴趣，如他们自己所说，人生的首要目标就是“做生意”。当然，他们也不会放弃诸如谈恋爱、海水浴、看电影等更为简单的生活享乐。但是，他们非常理智地把这些娱乐消遣安排在周六下午或周日，而在一周的其他日子，他们则尽力赚钱。傍晚下班后，在固定的某个时间，人们在咖啡馆聚会，在同一条林阴大道上散步，或者站在阳台上呼吸夜晚的空气。年轻人的热情强烈而又短暂；至于年长些的人们，他们的嗜好不过是打打保龄球，参加宴会和“社交聚会”，或是去俱乐部打牌狂赌一番。","Perhaps the easiest way of making a town’s acquaintance is to ascertain how the people in it work, how they love, and how they die.In our little town (is this, one wonders, an effect of the climate?) all three are done on much the same lines, with the same feverish yet casual air.The truth is that everyone is bored, and devotes himself to cultivating habits.Our citizens work hard, but solely with the object of getting rich.Their chief interest is in commerce, and their chief aim in life is, as they call it, “doing business.”Naturally they don’t eschew such simpler pleasures as love-making, seabathing, going to the pictures.But, very sensibly, they reserve these pastimes for Saturday afternoons and Sundays and employ the rest of the week in making money, as much as possible.In the evening, on leaving the office, they forgather, at an hour that never varies, in the cafes, stroll the same boulevard, or take the air on their balconies.The passions of the young are violent and short-lived; the vices of older men seldom range beyond an addiction to bowling, to banquets and “socials,” or clubs where large sums change hands on the fall of a card."
"毫无疑问，有人会说这些生活习惯并非是我们这个城市所特有的。其实我们同时代的人都这么生活。人们从早到晚地工作，然后把业余生活的时间耗在牌桌上、咖啡馆里或闲谈上，这在当今社会确实是最常见的事情了。然而，仍然有些城镇和乡村的人们时而会透出一丝与众不同的地方。这一般不会改变他们的生活。但是，他们已经有了这样的迹象，这就很好。而奥兰小城看起来似乎没有这种迹象。换句话说，它是个十足现代的城镇。因此，没有必要详细描述这座城里人们的恋爱方式。这里的男男女女要么短暂地在所谓的“爱的行为”里纵情欢愉，要么安于平淡的婚姻生活。除了这两个极端，几乎没有中间状态。这也没什么特别的。和其他地方一样，在奥兰，由于缺乏时间和思考，人们只能是相爱而不懂爱。","It will be said, no doubt, that these habits are not peculiar to our town; really all our contemporaries are much the same.Certainly nothing is commoner nowadays than to see people working from morn till night and then proceeding to fritter away at card-tables, in cafes and in small-talk what time is left for living.Nevertheless there still exist towns and countries where people have now and then an inkling of something different.In general it doesn’t change their lives.Still, they have had an intimation, and that’s so much to the good.Oran, however, seems to be a town without intimations; in other words, completely modern.Hence I see no need to dwell on the manner of loving in our town.The men and women consume one another rapidly in what is called “the act of love,” or else settle down to a mild habit of conjugality.We seldom find a mean between these extremes.That, too, is not exceptional.At Oran, as elsewhere, for lack of time and thinking, people have to love one another without knowing much about it."
"在我们这个城市，更为特别的地方在于垂死时人们可能经历的困难。也许“困难”二字用得不好，“难受”会更恰当些。生病总是不舒服的，但是，可以这么说，有些城市会在你生病时给你支持。在那里，你多少可以感觉自然放松。一个病人需要一些关心，想获得些支持，这很自然。但是在奥兰，严酷的气候、繁忙的生意、乏味的环境、短暂的黄昏以及各种享乐的本质等等都要求人们有个健康的身体。一个病人在那里会感到不自在。想想当全城的人们坐在咖啡馆里，或是拿着电话谈论着装船、提货单、贴现的时候，一个垂死之人关在灼热的重重围墙之后，那会是怎样的一种境况呀！即使在现代社会，在这样一个干燥炎热的地方，这种死亡将至的难受也是显而易见的。","What is more exceptional in our town is the difficulty one may experience there in dying.“Difficulty,” perhaps, is not the right word, “discomfort” would come nearer.Being ill’s never agreeable but there are towns that stand by you, so to speak, when you are sick; in which you can, after a fashion, let yourself go.An invalid needs small attentions, he likes to have something to rely on, and that’s natural enough.But at Oran the violent extremes of temperature, the exigencies of business, the uninspiring surroundings, the sudden nightfalls, and the very nature of its pleasures call for good health.An invalid feels out of it there.Think what it must be for a dying man, trapped behind hundreds of walls all sizzling with heat, while the whole population, sitting in cafes or hanging on the telephone, is discussing shipments, bills of lading, discounts!It will then be obvious what discomfort attends death, even modern death, when it waylays you under such conditions in a dry place."
"这些有点随意的观察或许可以让人对这个城市有个很好的了解。但是，我们不能过分夸大这一切。的确，这一切都表明这个城市的外表及城中的生活都是平凡无趣的。但是，一旦人们习以为常，日子也就不难打发了。而且，既然习惯是这个城市所推崇的，那么一切就都朝着好的方向发展。从这个角度来看，这里的生活不太有趣，这是毋庸置疑的。但至少这里从未有过社会不稳定的现象。坦率、友好、勤劳的本城居民总是能获得游客们理所当然的尊重。没有树木，没有魅力，没有灵魂，奥兰城归于表面的宁静；只消一会儿工夫，人们便会满意地进入梦乡。","These somewhat haphazard observations may give a fair idea of what our town is like.However, we must not exaggerate.Really, all that was to be conveyed was the banality of the town’s appearance and of life in it.But you can get through the days there without trouble, once you have formed habits.And since habits are precisely what our town encourages, all is for the best.Viewed from this angle, its life is not particularly exciting; that must be admitted.But, at least, social unrest is quite unknown among us.And our frank-spoken, amiable, and industrious citizens have always inspired a reasonable esteem in visitors.Treeless, glamour-less, soulless, the town of Oran ends by seeming restful and, after a while, you go complacently to sleep there."
"应该加句公道话，奥兰有着独特的风景，它处在一个光秃秃的高原中间，四周被阳光明媚的山丘围绕，前面是个造型完美的海湾。可令人感到遗憾的是，这座城市背着海湾而建，因此人们得走上一段路才可能看到海。","It is only fair to add that Oran is grafted on to a unique landscape, in the center of a bare plateau, ringed with luminous hills and above a perfectly shaped bay.All we may regret is the town’s being so disposed that it turns its back on the bay, with the result that it’s impossible to see the sea, you always have to go to look for it."
"知道了奥兰的日常生活，人们就不难相信，我们这座城里的居民们一点儿都不能理解发生在那年春天的事，而这些事情正是本书所要记录的重大事件的先兆（这是我们后来才意识到的）。对于一些人而言，这些事件看起来很自然；可对另外一些人而言，一切都难以置信。但是，很显然，一个叙述者是不能将这些不同的看法统统考虑在内的。他要做的只是在他知道确实发生了某件事，且这件事深切影响了全体人民的生活，还会有千万名见证人发自内心证实他所记录的真实情况的时候，说一句：“事情就是这样”。","Such being the normal life of Oran, it will be easily understood that our fellow citizens had not the faintest reason to apprehend the incidents that took place in the spring of the year in question and were (as we subsequently realized) premonitory signs of the grave events we are to chronicle.To some, these events will seem quite natural; to others, all but incredible.But, obviously, a narrator cannot take account of these differences of outlook.His business is only to say: “This is what happened,” when he knows that it actually did happen, that it closely affected the life of a whole populace, and that there are thousands of eyewitnesses who can appraise in their hearts the truth of what he writes."
"要是他没有机会收集到大量信息，要是他没有受外力所驱亲身经历他要叙述的事件，那么这位叙述者（到时候读者就会知道他的身份）无论如何也没有能力来完成这项工作。正是由于这个原因他才充当起史学家的角色。当然，一个史学家，即使是业余的，在工作中总是需要一些资料——个人收集的或二手的——给他以指导。现在这位叙述者拥有三种资料：首先是他亲眼所见的；其次是其他见证人所说的（因为他的工作，他能了解这篇纪事中提到的所有人物的个人看法）；最后就是那些他后来掌握的文字记载。他可以在任何有需要的时候引用这些资料，并以自己认为最好的方式加以利用。他也可以……","In any case the narrator (whose identity will be made known in due course) would have little claim to competence for a task like this, had not chance put him in the way of gathering much information, and had he not been, by the force of things, closely involved in all that he proposes to narrate.This is his justification for playing the part of a historian.Naturally, a historian, even an amateur, always has data, personal or at second hand, to guide him.The present narrator has three kinds of data: first, what he saw himself; secondly, the accounts of other eyewitnesses (thanks to the part he played, he was enabled to learn their personal impressions from all those figuring in this chronicle); and, lastly, documents that subsequently came into his hands.He proposes to draw on these records whenever this seems desirable, and to employ them as he thinks best.He also proposes..."
"但是，也许该结束这段开场白和上面的几句忠告了，让我们言归正传吧。发生在头几天的事情还需先详细说说。","But perhaps the time has come to drop preliminaries and cautionary remarks and to launch into the narrative proper.The account of the first days needs giving in some detail."
"第一章","Chapter 1"
"四月十六日早晨，伯纳德·里厄医生离开他的诊所时，感觉脚下踩上了个软软的东西。那是只躺在台阶中间的死老鼠。他当即就把老鼠一脚踢到一边，并未多想，然后继续下楼。当他来到大街上，他才突然想到死老鼠不该躺在台阶上，于是回头叫看门人把老鼠弄走。直到他看到看门人米歇尔老先生的反应，他才意识到这个发现有些不寻常。他自己只是觉得出现这只死老鼠有些奇怪，仅此而已，而看门人却感到很震惊。这一点他很肯定：“这里根本没有老鼠。”医生告诉米歇尔，确实有只老鼠，可能是死的，躺在二楼楼梯口，但根本没用，米歇尔的看法是不会动摇的。他坚持自己“这幢楼里根本没有老鼠”的说法，因此这只老鼠一定是有人从外面带进来的。很可能是某个年轻人搞的恶作剧。","When leaving his surgery on the morning of April 16, Dr. Bernard Rieux felt something soft under his foot.It was a dead rat lying in the middle of the landing.On the spur of the moment he kicked it to one side and, without giving it a further thought, continued on his way downstairs.Only when he was stepping out into the street did it occur to him that a dead rat had no business to be on his landing, and he turned back to ask the concierge of the building to see to its removal.It was not until he noticed old M. Michel’s reaction to the news that he realized the peculiar nature of his discovery.Personally, he had thought the presence of the dead rat rather odd, no more than that; the concierge, however, was genuinely outraged.On one point he was categorical: “There weren’t no rats here.”In vain the doctor assured him that there was a rat, presumably dead, on the second-floor landing; M. Michel’s conviction wasn’t to be shaken.There “weren’t no rats in the building,” he repeated, so someone must have brought this one from outside.Some youngster trying to be funny, most likely."
"当天晚上，当里厄医生站在大门口，从口袋里摸钥匙，准备上楼回家的时候，他看见一只大老鼠从阴暗的过道尽头朝他走了过来。它步伐迟疑，全身湿淋淋的。这个家伙停了一会儿，像是想稳住身子，然后它朝着医生挪过来，又停了一会儿，接着轻轻地叫着，在原地打了几个转，最后身体歪向一边倒在了地上。它的嘴微微张着，鲜血涌了出来。注视了这只老鼠一会儿，医生上楼去了。","That evening, when Dr. Rieux was standing in the entrance, feeling for the latch-key in his pocket before starting up the stairs to his apartment, he saw a big rat coming toward him from the dark end of the passage.It moved uncertainly, and its fur was sopping wet.The animal stopped and seemed to be trying to get its balance, moved forward again toward the doctor, halted again, then spun round on itself with a little squeal and fell on its side.Its mouth was slightly open and blood was spurting from it.After gazing at it for a moment, the doctor went upstairs."
"他想的并不是老鼠。看到那喷涌的鲜血，他想起了整天萦绕在他心头的事情。他那病了一年的妻子明天就要去往山区疗养院了。在卧室里，他看见妻子按他的吩咐正在躺着休息，为明天的旅途劳顿养精神。妻子朝着他微笑。","He wasn’t thinking about the rat.That glimpse of spurting blood had switched his thoughts back to something that had been on his mind all day.His wife, who had been ill for a year now, was due to leave next day for a sanatorium in the mountains.He found her lying down in the bedroom, resting, as he had asked her to do, in view of the exhausting journey before her.She gave him a smile."
"“你知道吗？我感觉好多了！”她说。","“Do you know, I’m feeling ever so much better!” she said."
"医生低头凝视着在床头灯的亮光中那张转向他的脸。他的妻子三十岁了，长时间的生病让她满脸病容。但里厄在凝视她时，心里只有一个念头：“她多么年轻呀，简直就像个少女！”但也许正是因为这微笑弥补了一切。","The doctor gazed down at the face that turned toward him in the glow of the bedside lamp.His wife was thirty, and the long illness had left its mark on her face.Yet the thought that came to Rieux’s mind as he gazed at her was: “How young she looks, almost like a little girl!”But perhaps that was because of the smile, which effaced all else."
"“现在好好睡吧。”他劝道，“护士十一点来，你看，你们得赶十二点的火车。”","“Now try to sleep,” he counseled.“The nurse is coming at eleven, you know, and you have to catch the midday train.”"
"他吻了吻她那有点湿润的前额。她微笑着目送他走到门口。","He kissed the slightly moist forehead.The smile escorted him to the door."
"第二天，即四月十七日，八点钟，医生正要出去的时候，看门人拦住了他。看门人告诉他那些年轻的坏家伙又在大厅里扔了三只死老鼠。这些老鼠很显然是用带有硬弹簧的补鼠器捕来的，因为它们浑身是血。看门人拎着老鼠的爪子，盯着来往行人，在门口呆了好一会儿，想在那些坏家伙咧嘴一笑，或是说些玩笑话的时候将他们逮个正着。然而这只是徒劳而已。","Next day, April 17, at eight o’clock the concierge buttonholed the doctor as he was going out.Some young scallywags, he said, had dumped three dead rats in the hall.They’d obviously been caught in traps with very strong springs, as they were bleeding profusely.The concierge had lingered in the doorway for quite a while, holding the rats by their legs and keeping a sharp eye on the passers-by, on the off chance that the miscreants would give themselves away by grinning or by some facetious remark.His watch had been in vain."
"“但我一定会逮住他们的。”米歇尔乐观地说。","“But I’ll nab ’em all right,” said M. Michel hopefully."
"怀着满腹疑惑，里厄决定开始去郊区巡诊，那里居住着他最贫穷的病人。那些地区的垃圾要到上午晚些时候才清理，他开车沿着尘土飞扬的、笔直的街道行驶时，瞥了几眼排在人行道旁的垃圾桶。仅仅在一条街上，他算了一下，竟有十二只老鼠被丢在烂菜及其他垃圾堆中。","Much puzzled, Rieux decided to begin his round in the outskirts of the town, where his poorer patients lived.The scavenging in these districts was done late in the morning and, as he drove his car along the straight, dusty streets, he cast glances at the garbage cans aligned along the edge of the sidewalk.In one street alone the doctor counted as many as a dozen rats deposited on the vegetable and other refuse in the cans."
"医生看的第一个病人是位慢性哮喘病患者。他住在临街的一间屋子里，吃饭睡觉都在这里，这时正呆在床上。他是位表情严肃、满脸皱纹的西班牙老人。他身体前面的被子上放着两个装着干豆的锅子。医生进来时，这位老人正坐起来，仰着脖子，呼哧呼哧喘着粗气。他的妻子端来一碗水。","He found his first patient, an asthma case of long standing, in bed, in a room that served as both diningroom and bedroom and overlooked the street.The invalid was an old Spaniard with a hard, rugged face.Placed on the coverlet in front of him were two pots containing dried peas.When the doctor entered, the old man was sitting up, bending his neck back, gasping and wheezing in his efforts to recover his breath.His wife brought a bowl of water."
"医生给他打针时，他说：“医生，它们出来了，你注意到了吗？”","“Well, doctor,” he said, while the injection was being made, “they’re coming out, have you noticed?”"
"“他说的是老鼠。”他妻子解释说，“隔壁的人发现了三只。”","“The rats, he means,” his wife explained.“The man next door found three.”"
"“它们出来了，垃圾桶里到处都是。它们是饿坏了呀！”","“They’re coming out, you can see them in all the trash cans.It’s hunger!”"
"里厄很快就发现那个地区的居民都在热烈谈论着老鼠的事情。巡诊结束后，他就开车回家了。","Rieux soon discovered that the rats were the great topic of conversation in that part of the town.After his round of visits he drove home."
"米歇尔先生告诉他：“先生，楼上有份你的电报。”","“There’s a telegram for you, sir, upstairs,” M. Michel informed him."
"医生问他有没有再发现老鼠。","The doctor asked him if he’d seen any more rats."
"“没有，”看门人回答说，“再也不会有了。你看，我一直守在这里。那些年轻人也不敢再来了。”","“No,” the concierge replied, “there ain’t been any more.I’m keeping a sharp lookout, you know.Those youngsters wouldn’t dare when I’m around.”"
"里厄从电报中得知，他母亲明天要过来。儿媳不在家这段时间，她要帮儿子照料家务。医生回到家，发现护士已经来了。他看了看妻子。她穿着量身定做的一套衣裳，还搽了胭脂。他朝妻子微笑。","The telegram informed Rieux that his mother would be arriving next day.She was going to keep house for her son during his wife’s absence.When the doctor entered his apartment he found the nurse already there.He looked at his wife.She was in a tailor-made suit, and he noticed that she had used rouge.He smiled to her."
"“真好看，”他说，“你美极了。”","“That’s splendid,” he said.“You’re looking very nice.”"
"不久后，他把她送上卧铺车厢。她环视了一下车厢。","A few minutes later he was seeing her into the sleeping-car.She glanced round the compartment."
"“对我们来说，这太奢侈了，不是吗？”","“It’s too expensive for us really, isn’t it?”"
"“应该这样的，”里厄说。","“It had to be done,” Rieux replied."
"“那些四处流窜的老鼠，到底是怎么回事？”","“What’s this story about rats that’s going round?”"
"“我说不清楚。这确实很奇怪，不过都会过去的。”","“I can’t explain it.It certainly is queer, but it’ll pass.”"
"接着，他仓促地请她原谅自己，他觉得本该更好地照顾她，而自己太不称职了。她摇摇头，像是要他别再说了，但他又说：“不管怎样，你回来后，一切都会好起来。我们会有一个新的开始。”","Then hurriedly he begged her to forgive him; he felt he should have looked after her better, he’d been most remiss.When she shook her head, as if to make him stop, he added: “Anyhow, once you’re back everything will be better.We’ll make a fresh start.”"
"“一定会的！”她的眼睛闪着亮光，“让我们有个新的开始。”","“That’s it!”Her eyes were sparkling.“Let’s make a fresh start.”"
"然后，她转过脸去，像是透过车窗注视着外面月台上行色匆匆、你推我挤的人群。他们听到了火车的汽笛声。他轻轻地叫了一下妻子的名字，她回过身来，脸上布满了泪水。","But then she turned her head and seemed to be gazing through the car window at the people on the platform, jostling one another in their haste.The hissing of the locomotive reached their ears.Gently he called his wife’s first name; when she looked round he saw her face wet with tears."
"“不要这样。”他轻声说。","“Don’t,” he murmured."
"她含着泪，又露出了笑容，带着一丝紧张。她深吸了一口气。","Behind the tears the smile returned, a little tense.She drew a deep breath."
"“你走吧！一切都会很好的。”","“Now off you go!Everything will be all right.”"
"他把她抱在怀里，然后下到月台上。透过车窗，他看到的只有她的微笑。","He took her in his arms, then stepped back on the platform.Now he could only see her smile through the window."
"“亲爱的，”他说，“照顾好自己。”","“Please, dear,” he said, “take great care of yourself.”"
"但她听不见他说的话。","But she could not hear him."
"离开月台，接近出口时，他遇到了警局地方治安官奥顿先生，一手拉着他的小儿子。医生问他是否要出门。","As he was leaving the platform, near the exit he met M. Othon, the police magistrate, holding his small boy by the hand.The doctor asked him if he was going away."
"奥顿先生个子很高，皮肤黝黑，有点儿过去所谓上流人物的架势，又有点像丧仪人的助手。","Tall and dark, M. Othon had something of the air of what used to be called a man of the world, and something of an undertaker’s assistant."
"“不，”治安官回答说，“我是来接我太太的，她去探望了我的家人。”","“No,” the magistrate replied, “I’ve come to meet Madame Othon, who’s been to present her respects to my family.”"
"火车鸣笛了。","The engine whistled."
"“现在这些老鼠——”治安官开口问道。","“These rats, now—” the magistrate began."
"里厄很快地转身看了一下火车，又回过身来朝着出口处。","Rieux made a brief movement in the direction of the train, then turned back toward the exit."
"“老鼠吗？”他说，“没什么大不了的。”","“The rats?” he said.“It’s nothing.”"
"后来他回想起来，那一刻给他留下的唯一印象是，一个铁路工人胳膊下夹着一个装满死老鼠的盒子走了过去。","The only impression of that moment which, afterwards, he could recall was the passing of a railroadman with a box full of dead rats under his arm."
"那天中午刚过，里厄正要开始接诊，一个年轻人来访。医生了解到，这人是个新闻记者，早上已经来过了。他叫雷蒙·朗贝尔。他个子不高，宽肩膀，神色坚毅，目光锐利，给人一种任何情况下都能达到目的的印象。他穿着一身运动服。他开门见山地表明了来意。他来自巴黎一家著名日报，报社派他来报道一下阿拉伯人目前的生活状况，特别是卫生状况。","Early in the afternoon of that day, when his consultations were beginning, a young man called on Rieux.The doctor gathered that he had called before, in the morning, and was a journalist by profession.His name was Raymond Rambert.Short, square-shouldered, with a determined-looking face and keen, intelligent eyes, he gave the impression of someone who could keep his end up in any circumstances.He wore a sports type of clothes.He came straight to the point.His newspaper, one of the leading Paris dailies, had commissioned him to make a report on the living-conditions prevailing among the Arab population, and especially on the sanitary conditions."
"里厄回答说状况并不好。但是，在进一步交谈之前，他想知道这位记者是否能如实报道。","Rieux replied that these conditions were not good.But, before he said any more, he wanted to know if the journalist would be allowed to tell the truth."
"“当然。”朗贝尔说。","“Certainly,” Rambert replied."
"“我的意思是，”里厄解释说，“你是否能毫无保留地报道对于现状的谴责之声？”","“I mean,” Rieux explained, “would you be allowed to publish an unqualified condemnation of the present state of things?”"
"“毫无保留？噢，不，我做不到。但事情没有这么糟吧？”","“Unqualified?Well, no, I couldn’t go that far.But surely things aren’t quite so bad as that?”"
"“没有，”里厄平静地说，事情并没有这么糟。他提出这个问题，只是想知道朗贝尔是否能据实报道而不是搪塞了事。“既然要有所保留，我无话可说，”他接着说，“因此我不会提供你所需的信息。”","“No,” Rieux said quietly, they weren’t so bad as that.He had put the question solely to find out if Rambert could or couldn’t state the facts without paltering with the truth.“I’ve no use for statements in which something is kept back,” he added.“That is why I shall not furnish information in support of yours.”"
"记者笑着说，“你说的话如同出自圣茹斯特之口。”","The journalist smiled.“You talk the language of Saint-Just.”"
"里厄继续平静地说，他对圣茹斯特一无所知。他的语气像一个厌倦了自己所生活的世界的人所用的语气——尽管他很爱他的同胞——但他本人绝不做不公正的事情，也决不向真相妥协。","Without raising his voice Rieux said he knew nothing about that.The language he used was that of a man who was sick and tired of the world he lived in—though he had much liking for his fellow men—and had resolved, for his part, to have no truck with injustice and compromises with the truth."
"朗贝尔耸耸肩，盯着医生，好一会儿说不出话来。之后，他边起身边说：“我想我能理解你。”","His shoulders hunched, Rambert gazed at the doctor for some moments without speaking.Then, “I think I understand you,” he said, getting up from his chair."
"医生送他出门。","The doctor accompanied him to the door."
"“你能这样看问题，这很好。”医生说。","“It’s good of you to take it like that,” he said."
"“是的，是的，我能理解，”朗贝尔带着一丝不耐烦的语气说，“很抱歉打扰你了。”","“Yes, yes, I understand,” Rambert repeated, with what seemed a hint of impatience in his voice.“Sorry to have troubled you.”"
"握手道别时，里厄提出若是朗贝尔想在报纸上登些稀奇古怪的故事，他倒是可以谈谈此时市里出现的大量死老鼠。","When shaking hands with him, Rieux suggested that if he was out for curious stories for his paper, he might say something about the extraordinary number of dead rats that were being found in the town just now."
"“啊！”朗贝尔叫了起来，“这的确让我很感兴趣。”","“Ah!” Rambert exclaimed.“That certainly interests me.”"
"下午五点，医生又要出门去巡诊，在楼梯上他与一个又矮又壮、还算年轻的人擦肩而过。这人大脸盘，皱纹很深，眉毛很浓。在这幢楼的最高层，那个住着几个西班牙男舞蹈演员的家里，他见过这人几次。他叫让·塔鲁。此时他正抽着烟，眼睛盯着面前楼梯上一只老鼠在作垂死时的最后抽搐。他抬起头，用灰色的眼睛看了看医生；打过招呼后，他说道，这些老鼠爬到洞穴外死掉，真是件非常奇怪的事情。","On his way out at five for another round of visits, the doctor passed on the stairway a stocky, youngish man, with a big, deeply furrowed face and bushy eyebrows.He had met him once or twice in the top-floor apartment, which was occupied by some male Spanish dancers.Puffing a cigarette, Jean Tarrou was gazing down at the convulsions of a rat dying on the step in front of him.He looked up, and his gray eyes remained fixed on the doctor for some moments; then, after wishing him good day, he remarked that it was rather odd, the way all these rats were coming out of their holes to die."
"“非常奇怪，”里厄应和道，“而且这到底会令人心烦的。”","“Very odd,” Rieux agreed, “and it ends by getting on one’s nerves.”"
"“在某种程度上是这样的，医生，只是在某种程度上罢了。我们以前从未见过此类事情，仅此而已。我个人觉得这事有趣，是的，非常有趣。”","“In a way, doctor, only in a way.We’ve not seen anything of the sort before, that’s all.Personally I find it interesting, yes, definitely interesting.”"
"塔鲁用手捋了捋头发，又看了看老鼠，发现它已不动了，于是他朝里厄笑了笑。","Tarrou ran his fingers through his hair to brush it off his forehead, looked again at the rat, which had now stopped moving, then smiled toward Rieux."
"“不过，医生，这的确令看门人头疼，不是吗？”","“But really, doctor, it’s the concierge’s headache, isn’t it?”"
"情况果真如此，里厄下一个遇见的人就是看门人。他倚靠在临街大门口旁边的墙上，面容憔悴，脸上失去了平日里的红润。","As it so happened, the concierge was the next person Rieux encountered.He was leaning against the wall beside the street door; he was looking tired and his normally rubicund face had lost its color."
"里厄告诉他最近又发现了死老鼠，这老头说：“是的，我知道。我看到它们三三两两地出现。不过这条街上其他房子里的情况也是如此。”","“Yes, I know,” the old man told Rieux, who had informed him of the latest casualty among the rats.“I keep finding ’em by twos and threes.But it’s the same thing in the other houses in the street.”"
"他神情沮丧，看起来忧心忡忡，茫然地搓着脖子。里厄问他是不是不舒服。看门人是不会连自己感到身体不适都说出来的。不过，他的健康状况确实欠佳。但在他看来，这只是内心担忧引起的，他会说这些该死的老鼠令他“大吃一惊”之类的话。要是不再到处出现死老鼠，他也就放心了。","He seemed depressed and worried, and was scratching his neck absentmindedly.Rieux asked him how he felt.The concierge wouldn’t go so far as to say he was feeling ill.Still he wasn’t quite up to the mark.In his opinion it was just due to worry; these damned rats had given him “a shock, like.”It would be a relief when they stopped coming out and dying all over the place."
"第二天早上——那天是四月十八日——当医生从车站将母亲接回家时，他发现米歇尔先生看起来身体状况更加不好了。地窖到楼顶的楼梯上零零散散躺着十几只死老鼠。街坊邻居的垃圾桶里也装满了老鼠。","Next morning—it was April 18—when the doctor was bringing back his mother from the station, he found M. Michel looking still more out of sorts.The stairway from the cellar to the attics was strewn with dead rats, ten or a dozen of them.The garbage cans of all the houses in the street were full of rats."
"医生的母亲对此反应很平静。","The doctor’s mother took it quite calmly."
"“有时会这样的。”她低声说。她身材矮小，满头银发，黑眼睛透着温柔。“伯纳德，很高兴又见到你了，”她又说，“无论怎样，这些老鼠是不会影响我的心情的。”","“It’s like that sometimes,” she said vaguely.She was a small woman with silver hair and dark, gentle eyes.“I’m so glad to be with you again, Bernard,” she added.“The rats can’t change that, anyhow.”"
"他点点头。确实，有母亲在，什么事情看起来都好办。","He nodded.It was a fact that everything seemed easy when she was there."
"但是，里厄还是给市政府办公室打了个电话。他认识那里灭鼠除害工作相关部门的负责人，问他是否听说了许多老鼠死在外面的事情。是的，负责人默西埃知道整件事情。实际上，在离码头不远的他的那些办公室里就发现了五十只老鼠。老实说，他很焦虑，他问医生是否认为情况严重。","However, he rang up the Municipal Office.He knew the man in charge of the department concerned with the extermination of vermin and he asked him if he’d heard about all the rats that were coming out to die in the open.Yes, Mercier knew all about it; in fact, fifty rats had been found in his offices, which were near the wharves.To tell the truth, he was rather perturbed; did the doctor think it meant anything serious?"
"里厄没有明确表态，但他认为卫生部门应该采取一些行动。默西埃表示赞同。“那么，如果你觉得这值得一做，我会下令的。”","Rieux couldn’t give a definite opinion, but he thought the sanitary service should take action of some kind.Mercier agreed.“And, if you think it’s really worth the trouble, I’ll get an order issued as well.”"
"“当然值得一做。”里厄回答说。","“It certainly is worth the trouble,” Rieux replied."
"他的女佣刚刚告诉他，在她丈夫工作的大工厂里已经捡到了几百只死老鼠了。","His charwoman had just told him that several hundred dead rats had been collected in the big factory where her husband worked."
"大约就是在这个时期，城里的居民开始不安起来。因为，从四月十八日以后，工厂和仓库里发现了大量的已经死去或垂死挣扎的老鼠。有时，人们只好将那些垂死的老鼠弄死以结束它们的痛苦。从郊区到市中心，在医生出诊经过的每一条大街小巷里，老鼠堆积在垃圾桶里或成排地躺在排水沟里。那天的晚报提到了这件事，并责问市领导们是否会采取行动，会采取什么应急措施来对付这件特别讨厌的事情。事实上，市政府根本未做任何打算，只是召集开会，就这一情况进行讨论。卫生所奉命每天清晨收集死老鼠。收集完毕后，两辆市政卡车将死老鼠运往市垃圾焚化炉焚毁。","It was about this time that our townsfolk began to show signs of uneasiness.For, from April 18 onwards, quantities of dead or dying rats were found in factories and warehouses.In some cases the animals were killed to put an end to their agony.From the outer suburbs to the center of the town, in all the byways where the doctor’s duties took him, in every thoroughfare, rats were piled up in garbage cans or lying in long lines in the gutters.The evening papers that day took up the matter and inquired whether or not the city fathers were going to take steps, and what emergency measures were contemplated, to abate this particularly disgusting nuisance.Actually the municipality had not contemplated doing anything at all, but now a meeting was convened to discuss the situation.An order was transmitted to the sanitary service to collect the dead rats at daybreak every morning.When the rats had been collected, two municipal trucks were to take them to be burned in the town incinerator."
"但是，此后的几天，情况变得更加糟糕了。街上的死老鼠越来越多，每天早上卡车的负载也越来越重。到第四天，老鼠开始纷纷爬出洞外，然后成批死去。白天，它们从地下室、地窖和下水道成群地爬出来，无助地摇来晃去，原地踮着脚打转，然后死在惊恐的看客脚下。夜晚，在过道和巷子里，人们可以清晰地听见它们垂死的低声哀叫。到了早上，排水沟里可见一排排的老鼠尸体，每只老鼠的尖嘴上都带着像朵红花似的血块；一些已经肿胀腐烂，另一些则鼠须直竖，身体僵硬。甚至在最繁忙的市中心，也可以看到死老鼠一小堆一小堆地摞在楼梯口和院子里。也有些老鼠孤零零地死在市政大厅里、学校操场上，甚至咖啡馆的露台上。城里居民惊愕地发现，武器广场、林阴道、海滨大道等热闹的地方也散落着令人讨厌的老鼠尸体。每天清晨全城被彻底清扫后，情况会有短暂的缓解。可到了白天，渐渐地又会有越来越多的老鼠出现。夜晚外出的人们经常会感觉到脚下踩着了一团软绵绵的仍有余温的老鼠尸体。这就像是我们的房屋所坐落的大地正在清洗它的分泌物，挤出表面的是一直在它内部作祟的脓肿和脓血。这座小城一直都很平静，而现在却出人意料地大乱起来，就像一个健康之人突然感到体温骤升，热血在血管中似野火般燃烧，可以想象这座小城的惊恐程度。","But the situation worsened in the following days.There were more and more dead vermin in the streets, and the collectors had bigger truckloads every morning.On the fourth day the rats began to come out and die in batches.From basements, cellars, and sewers they emerged in long wavering files into the light of day, swayed helplessly, then did a sort of pirouette and fell dead at the feet of the horrified onlookers.At night, in passages and alleys, their shrill little death-cries could be clearly heard.In the mornings the bodies were found lining the gutters, each with a gout of blood, like a red flower, on its tapering muzzle; some were bloated and already beginning to rot, others rigid, with their whiskers still erect.Even in the busy heart of the town you found them piled in little heaps on landings and in backyards.Some stole forth to die singly in the halls of public offices, in school playgrounds, and even on cafe terraces.Our townsfolk were amazed to find such busy centers as the Place d’Armes, the boulevards, the promenade along the waterfront, dotted with repulsive little corpses.After the daily clean-up of the town, which took place at sunrise, there was a brief respite; then gradually the rats began to appear again in numbers that went on increasing throughout the day.People out at night would often feel underfoot the squelchy roundness of a still warm body.It was as if the earth on which our houses stood were being purged of its secreted humors; thrusting up to the surface the abscesses and pus-clots that had been forming in its entrails.You must picture the consternation of our little town, hitherto so tranquil, and now, out of the blue, shaken to its core, like a quite healthy man who all of a sudden feels his temperature shoot up and the blood seething like wildfire in his veins."
"事态发展得很严重，朗斯多克情报信息局（能够及时准确地收集各种情报信息的机构）在一个发布信息的宣传类广播谈话节目中首先就宣布，仅仅在四月二十五日这一天，收集焚毁的老鼠就不少于6231只。这个惊人的数字使人们对于每天在眼皮子底下出现的场景有了更清楚的认识，这引起了公众的惊慌。之前，人们只是对一件愚蠢而令人讨厌的怪事有所抱怨。而现在，他们却意识到这个影响范围尚不能确定、根源也不知晓的奇怪现象有些威胁性了。只有里厄医生的那位患气喘病的西班牙老人仍然搓着手，露出一脸苍老的笑容说：“它们出来了，它们出来了。”","Things went so far that the Ransdoc Information Bureau (inquiries on all subjects promptly and accurately answered), which ran a free-information talk on the radio, by way of publicity, began its talk by announcing that no less than 6,231 rats had been collected and burned in a single day, April 25.Giving as it did an ampler and more precise view of the scene daily enacted before our eyes, this amazing figure administered a jolt to the public nerves.Hitherto people had merely grumbled at a stupid, rather obnoxious visitation; they now realized that this strange phenomenon, whose scope could not be measured and whose origins escaped detection, had something vaguely menacing about it.Only the old Spaniard whom Dr. Rieux was treating for asthma went on rubbing his hands and chuckling: “They’re coming out, they’re coming out,” with senile glee."
"四月二十八日，当情报信息局宣布已收集到八千只老鼠的时候，惊恐的情绪在全城蔓延开来。有人要求采取严厉措施，有人谴责当局行动迟缓，而那些有海滨住房的人则谈论着要搬过去住，尽管还不到该搬去的季节。可第二天，情报信息局却宣称这一现象已突然终止，卫生所只收集到少量老鼠。人们也都松了口气。","On April 28, when the Ransdoc Bureau announced that 8,ooo rats had been collected, a wave of something like panic swept the town.There was a demand for drastic measures, the authorities were accused of slackness, and people who had (houses on the coast spoke of moving there, early in the year though it was.But next day the bureau informed them that the phenomenon had abruptly ended and the sanitary service had collected only a trifling number of rats.Everyone breathed more freely."
"可就在当天中午，里厄医生正在住所前停车时，看见看门人从街那头朝他走过来。他拖着身子往前挪，低着头，手脚奇怪地外张着，一颤一颤地像个上着发条的玩偶。老头靠在一位教士的肩膀上，医生认识这位教士。他是帕纳卢神父，一位博学而活跃的耶稣会教士，以前见过几次面。这人在市里威望很高，即使在那些漠视宗教的圈子里也是如此。里厄等着这两人走上前来。米歇尔先生烧得两眼发亮，喘着粗气。老人解释道，自己感到“有点不适”，于是出来透透气。但他开始感到全身疼痛——脖子、腋下、腹股沟——于是不得不往回走，并叫帕纳卢神父扶他一把。","It was, however, on this same day, at noon, that Dr. Rieux, when parking his car in front of the apartment house where he lived, noticed the concierge coming toward him from the end of the street.He was dragging himself along, his head bent, arms and legs curiously splayed out, with the jerky movements of a clockwork doll.The old man was leaning on the arm of a priest whom the doctor knew.It was Father Paneloux, a learned and militant Jesuit, whom he had met occasionally and who was very highly thought of in our town, even in circles quite indifferent to religion.Rieux waited for the two men to draw up to him.M. Michel’s eyes were fever-bright and he was breathing wheezily.The old man explained that, feeling “a bit off color,” he had gone out to take the air.But he had started feeling pains in all sorts of places—in his neck, armpits, and groin—and had been obliged to turn back and ask Father Paneloux to give him an arm."
"“只不过有几个肿块而已，”他说，“我一定是有些劳累过度了。”","“It’s just swellings,” he said.“I must have strained myself somehow.”"
"医生把手伸出车窗，摸了摸米歇尔的脖子底部。那里有个木头结节似的硬块。","Leaning out of the window of the car, the doctor ran his hand over the base of Michel’s neck; a hard lump, like a knot in wood, had formed there."
"“马上去躺下休息，量量体温。我下午来看你。”","“Go to bed at once, and take your temperature.I’ll come to see you this afternoon.”"
"看门人走后，里厄问帕纳卢神父对这奇怪的老鼠事件有何看法。","When the old man had gone, Rieux asked Father Paneloux what he made of this queer business about the rats."
"“哦，我想它们得的是瘟疫。”戴着大圆形眼镜的神父笑眯眯地说。","“Oh, I suppose it’s an epidemic they’ve been having.”The Father’s eyes were smiling behind his big round glasses."
"午餐后，里厄正在重新看那份妻子从疗养院发来的电报，告知她已到达，这时电话铃响了。打来电话的是他的一个老病人，一位市政府职员。他患上主动脉瓣狭窄症有很长一段时间了，因为他穷，里厄从不收他的诊费。","After lunch, while Rieux was reading for the second time the telegram his wife had sent him from the sanatorium, announcing her arrival, the phone rang.It was one of his former patients, a clerk in the Municipal Office, ringing him up.He had suffered for a long time from a constriction of the aorta, and, as he was poor, Rieux had charged no fee."
"“医生，谢谢你还记得我。但这一次是别人。我的邻居出事了。请你快过来。”他听起来上气不接下气。","“Thanks, doctor, for remembering me.But this time it’s somebody else.The man next door has had an accident.Please come at once.”He sounded out of breath."
"他飞快地想了想。是的，他可以晚些时候去看那位看门人。几分钟后，他走进了位于郊区的费代尔布街上的一栋小房子里。在又暗又臭的楼梯上他刚走到一半，就看见了约瑟夫·格朗，那个职员，正急急忙忙下楼来接他。他大约五十岁，高个子，驮背，肩膀很窄，四肢瘦长，蓄着淡黄色的小胡子。","Rieux thought quickly; yes, he could see the concierge afterwards.A few minutes later he was entering a small house in the rue Faidherbe, on the outskirts of the town.Halfway up the drafty, foul-smelling stairs, he saw Joseph Grand, the clerk, hurrying down to meet him.He was a man of about fifty years of age, tall and drooping, with narrow shoulders, thin limbs, and a yellowish mustache."
"“他现在好点儿了，”他对里厄说，“我本以为他完了。”他使劲擤了擤鼻子。在顶楼，也就是三楼，里厄看到左边有扇门上用红粉笔写的“请进，我上吊了”。","“He looks better now,” he told Rieux, “but I really thought his number was up.”He blew his nose vigorously.On the top floor, the third, Rieux noticed something scrawled in red chalk on a door on the left: Come in, I’ve hanged myself."
"他们进了屋。一条绳子从吊灯上垂下来，下面是一张侧翻在地上的椅子。餐桌已被推到了角落里。而绳子则空荡荡地挂在那里。","They entered the room.A rope dangled from a hanging lamp above a chair lying on its side.The dining-room table had been pushed into a corner.But the rope hung empty."
"“我及时把他救下来了。”格朗说话好像总在字斟句酌，尽管他说的都是最简单的话语。“我正要出门，听到有响声。当我看到门上的字时，我还以为这只是一个——一个玩笑。就在这时，我听见了一声奇怪的呻吟。这呻吟可以说是让我的血一下子冷了。”","“I got him down just in time.”Grand seemed always to have trouble in finding his words, though he expressed himself in the simplest possible way.“I was going out and I heard a noise.When I saw that writing on the door, I thought it was a—a prank.Only, then I heard a funny sort of groan; it made my blood run cold, as they say.”"
"他挠挠头。“依我看，这一定是件痛苦的事情。很自然，我就进房间了。”","He scratched his head.“That must be a painful way of—of doing it, I should think.Naturally I went in.”"
"格朗推开了一扇门，他们站在门槛上，这是间明亮而简陋的卧室。靠墙摆着一张铜床，床上躺着一个矮胖子，喘着粗气。他那充血的双眼注视着他们。里厄突然停下了步子。在这个男子呼吸的间歇中，他好像听到了老鼠的吱吱声。但在卧室角落里他没有发现什么动静。然后，里厄朝床边走去。显然这人并没有从太高的地方掉下来，摔得也不太突然，因为他的脊椎还完好无损。但自然有些窒息难受。需要照个X光片。于是，医生给他打了一针樟脑油，并且告诉他过几天就没事了。","Grand had opened a door and they were standing on the threshold of a bright but scantily furnished bedroom.There was a brass bedstead against one of the walls, and a plump little man was lying there, breathing heavily.He gazed at them with bloodshot eyes.Rieux stopped short.In the intervals of the man’s breathing he seemed to hear the little squeals of rats.But he couldn’t see anything moving in the corners of the room.Then he went to the bedside.Evidently the man had not fallen from a sufficient height, or very suddenly, for the collar-bone had held.Naturally there was some asphyxia.An X-ray photograph would be needed.Meanwhile the doctor gave him a camphor injection and assured him he would be all right in a few days."
"“谢谢，医生。”这个男子喃喃道。","“Thanks, doctor,” the man mumbled."
"当里厄问起格朗是否已经报警时，格朗低下头来。","When Rieux asked Grand if he had notified the police, he hung his head."
"“哦，事实上，我没报警。我当时认为首要的事情是——”","“Well, as a matter of fact, I haven’t.The first thing, I thought, was to—” "
"“那么，”里厄打断他的话，“我会去的。”","“Quite so,” Rieux cut in.“I’ll see to it.”"
"但病人焦急地坐起身子。他说他感觉好多了，确实没必要报警。","But the invalid made a fretful gesture and sat up in bed.He felt much better, he explained; really it wasn’t worth the trouble."
"“不用怕，”里厄说，“这只是常规做法。不管怎样，我得报警。”这个男子重重地倒在床上，开始啜泣起来。","“Don’t feel alarmed,” Rieux said.“It’s little more than a formality.Anyhow, I have to report this to the police.”“Oh!”The man slumped back on the bed and started sobbing weakly."
"格朗在他们说话的时候抚弄着他的小胡子，这时他走到床前。","Grand, who had been twiddling his mustache while they were speaking, went up to the bed."
"“科塔尔先生，”他说，“你要理解。假如你又想上吊的话，人们会归咎于医生的。”","“Come, Monsieur Cottard,” he said.“Try to understand.People could say the doctor was to blame, if you took it into your head to have another shot at it.”"
"科塔尔流着眼泪说他再也不会那样做了，他只是一时糊涂，但一切都过去了，他现在只想一个人静一静。里厄正在开药方。","Cottard assured him tearfully that there wasn’t the least risk of that; he’d had a sort of crazy fit, but it had passed and all he wanted now was to be left in peace.Rieux was writing a prescription."
"“很好，”他说，“我们暂时别再说这个了。过一两天我再来看你。不过别再干傻事了。”","“Very well,” he said.“We’ll say no more about it for the present.I’ll come and see you again in a day or two.But don’t do anything silly.”"
"在楼梯口，里厄告诉格朗他得去报告，但他会要求警官过几天再来调查。","On the landing he told Grand that he was obliged to make a report, but would ask the police inspector to hold up the inquiry for a couple of days."
"“不过，今晚要让人看着点儿科塔尔，”他又说，“他有亲属吗？”","“But somebody should watch Cottard tonight,” he added.“Has he any relations?”"
"“这个我不清楚。不过我可以留在他身边。我和他不熟，但帮助邻居是应该的，不是吗？”","“Not that I know of.But I can very well stay with him.I can’t say I really know him, but one’s got to help a neighbor, hasn’t one?”"
"里厄下楼时特意瞥了一眼阴暗的角落，问格朗在他们这里老鼠是否已经绝迹。","As he walked down the stairs Rieux caught himself glancing into the darker corners, and he asked Grand if the rats had quite disappeared in his part of the town."
"格朗对此一无所知。他确实听到了一些关于老鼠的议论，但对这样的传闻并没有太在意。“我有别的事情要操心呢。”他接着说。","Grand had no idea.True, he’d heard some talk about rats, but he never paid much attention to gossip like that.“I’ve other things to think about,” he added."
"里厄急着要离开，他在格朗说话时已同他握手道别。他要给妻子回封信，还想先去看望一下看门人。","Rieux, who was in a hurry to get away, was already shaking his hand.There was a letter to write to his wife, and he wanted to see the concierge first."
"卖报的在高声叫嚷着最新消息——老鼠已经不见了。但里厄发现他的病人靠着床沿，一手按着肚子，一手按着脖子，正往污水桶里吐着浅红色的胆汁。吐了好一会儿，他重新躺下，大口地喘着气。他的体温达39.4℃，脖子和四肢上的淋巴结都肿大，大腿上长着两块黑斑。他抱怨着肚子痛。","News-venders were shouting the latest news—that the rats had disappeared.But Rieux found his patient leaning over the edge of the bed, one hand pressed to his belly and the other to his neck, vomiting pinkish bile into a slop-pail.After retching for some moments, the man lay back again, gasping.His temperature was 103, the ganglia of his neck and limbs were swollen, and two black patches were developing on his thighs.He now complained of internal pains."
"“就像着火似的，”他埋怨说，“这混蛋在我心里烧得厉害。”","“It’s like fire,” he whimpered.“The bastard’s burning me inside.”"
"他那发热而干裂的嘴里很难吐出几个字来，鼓鼓的眼睛看着医生，因为头痛而眼里含着泪。他妻子忧心忡忡地看着一声不吭的里厄。","He could hardly get the words through his fever-crusted lips and he gazed at the doctor with bulging eyes that his headache had suffused with tears.His wife cast an anxious look at Rieux, who said nothing."
"“请问医生，”她说，“这是什么病呀？”","“Please, doctor,” she said, “what is it?”"
"“这可能是——啥病都有可能。现在还不确定。让他少吃点儿东西，多喝些水。”","“It might be—almost anything.There’s nothing definite as yet.Keep him on a light diet and give him plenty to drink.”"
"看门人总在抱怨嗓子太干。","The sick man had been complaining of a raging thirst."
"里厄一回家就打电话给他的同行理查德，城里最好的医生之一。“没有，”理查德说，“我没发现有什么特别之处。”","On returning to his apartment Rieux rang up his colleague Richard, one of the leading practitioners in the town.“No,” Richard said, “I can’t say I’ve noticed anything exceptional.”"
"“难道没有因局部发炎而引起发烧的病例吗？”","“No cases of fever with local inflammation?”"
"“等等！我这有两个淋巴结肿大的病例。”","“Wait a bit!I have two cases with inflamed ganglia.”"
"“这有什么不正常吗？”","“Abnormally so?”"
"“嗯，”理查德说，“这要看你认为什么才算‘正常’了。”","“Well,” Richard said, “that depends on what you mean by ‘normal.’” "
"但在当晚，看门人的体温上升至40℃，说着胡话，总在念叨着“那些老鼠”。里厄试图做个固定脓肿的处理。在松节油的烧灼下，老头儿大声嚎叫：“这些畜生！”","Anyhow, that night the porter was running a temperature of 104 and in delirium, always babbling about “them rats.”Rieux tried a fixation abscess.When he felt the sting of the turpentine, the old man yelled: “The bastards!”"
"淋巴结已经肿得更大了，摸上去就像嵌在肉里一个个硬包。米歇尔太太已经完全精神崩溃了。","The ganglia had become still larger and felt like lumps of solid fibrous matter embedded in the flesh.Mme Michel had completely broken down."
"“守着他，”医生说，“有事给我打电话。”","“Sit up with him,” the doctor said, “and call me if necessary.”"
"第二天，即四月三十日，天蓝蓝的，有点儿薄雾。暖风轻轻地吹着，带来一股从远郊传来的花香。清晨大街上的嘈杂声似乎比往日更响亮、更快乐。对于小城里的每个人来说，这一天带来了充满活力的新生活的希望，扫去了一星期来笼罩全城的恐惧的阴霾。里厄也心情开朗地下楼去看看门人，他收到了妻子的第一封来信，感到很开心。","Next day, April 30, the sky was blue and slightly misty.A warm, gentle breeze was blowing, bringing with it a smell of flowers from the outlying suburbs.The morning noises of the streets sounded louder, gayer than usual.For everyone in our little town this day brought the promise of a new lease of life, now that the shadow of fear under which they had been living for a week had lifted.Rieux, too, was in an optimistic mood when he went down to see the concierge; he had been cheered up by a letter from his wife that had come with the first mail."
"米歇尔老头的体温已降到37.2℃，尽管看起来还很虚弱，他在微笑着。“医生，他好些了，不是吗？”他妻子问。“嗯，现在说还有点儿太早。”","Old M. Michel’s temperature had gone down to 99 and, though he still looked very weak, he was smiling.“He’s better, doctor, isn’t he?” his wife inquired.“Well, it’s a bit too early to say.”"
"到了中午，看门人的体温一下子窜到了40℃，他不断地胡言乱语，又呕吐起来。脖子上的淋巴结痛得不能碰，看起来他好像要拼命地让头远离身体。他的妻子坐在床脚边，双手放在被子上，轻轻地握着他的双脚。她眼巴巴地看着里厄。","At noon the sick man’s temperature shot up abruptly to 104, he was in constant delirium and had started vomiting again.The ganglia in the neck were painful to the touch, and the old man seemed to be straining to hold his head as far as possible from his body.His wife sat at the foot of the bed, her hands on the counterpane, gently clasping his feet.She gazed at Rieux imploringly."
"“听着，”里厄说，“我们得把他送到医院去进行特殊护理。我去打电话叫救护车来。”","“Listen,” he said, “we’ll have to move him to a hospital and try a special treatment.I’ll ring up for the ambulance.”"
"两小时后，在救护车里，医生和米歇尔太太俯身看着病人。他那张糊上了厚厚一层疮的嘴里不断地吐出些胡言乱语。他不停地说：“那些老鼠！那些该死的老鼠！”他脸色发青、嘴唇发白、呼吸急促。由于淋巴结肿痛，他张着四肢，深陷在铺位里，仿佛想让床裹着他的身体，又像是地下深处有某种声音在召唤着他，这个痛苦的老人好像承受着某种无形的压力而感到窒息。他的妻子啜泣着。","Two hours later the doctor and Mme Michel were in the ambulance bending over the sick man.Rambling words were issuing from the gaping mouth, thickly coated now with sores.He kept on repeating: “Them rats!Them damned rats!”His face had gone livid, a grayish green, his lips were bloodless, his breath came in sudden gasps.His limbs spread out by the ganglia, embedded in the berth as if he were trying to bury himself in it or a voice from the depths of the earth were summoning him below, the unhappy man seemed to be stifling under some unseen pressure.His wife was sobbing."
"“医生，难道就没任何希望吗？”","“Isn’t there any hope left, doctor?”"
"“他死了。”里厄说。","“He’s dead,” said Rieux."
"第二章","Chapter 2"
"可以说，米歇尔的死标志着第一个阶段的结束，充满了令人困惑的预兆。另一个相对更加艰难的时期开始了，这时先前的震惊逐渐转变为恐慌。在后来发生了一系列事件后，我们的市民们回顾前一阶段时意识到，他们以前做梦也没想到在这个小城可能会发生大批老鼠死在光天化日之下，看门人死于怪病这样的怪事情。在这一点上，他们以前的想法是错误的，因此必然要加以修正。当然，如果事态发展仅仅到此为止，无疑又可以像以往那样习惯成自然。然而，不仅仅是佣人或穷人们，还有其他一些市民也开始步米歇尔的后尘相继死去。也就是在这个时候，人们开始感到恐惧，又因为恐惧而开始思考。","Michel’s death marked, one might say, the end of the first period, that of bewildering portents, and the beginning of another, relatively more trying, in which the perplexity of the early days gradually gave place to panic.Reviewing that first phase in the light of subsequent events, our townsfolk realized that they had never dreamed it possible that our little town should be chosen out for the scene of such grotesque happenings as the wholesale death of rats in broad daylight or the decease of concierges through exotic maladies.In this respect they were wrong, and their views obviously called for revision.Still, if things had gone thus far and no farther, force of habit would doubtless have gained the day, as usual.But other members of our community, not all menials or poor people, were to follow the path down which M. Michel had led the way.And it was then that fear, and with fear serious reflection, began."
"不过，在详述下一阶段情况之前，且让笔者谈谈另一位见证人对于前面已描述过的第一阶段的看法。琼·塔鲁，我们在故事开头提到过的那个人，几个星期前来到奥兰，正住在市中心的一家大旅馆里。表面上看，他有私人收入，不做生意。尽管市民们与他逐渐熟识起来，但是没人知道他来自何方，也没人了解他为什么来到奥兰。他经常出现在公共场所，而且在早春时期，每天都会去某个海滩。他显然喜欢游泳。他很幽默，时常面带微笑，似乎很喜欢一切正当的娱乐却不沉迷其中。实际上，他唯一为人所知的习惯是喜欢和本城众多的西班牙舞蹈家和音乐家们来往。","However, before entering on a detailed account of the next phase, the narrator proposes to give the opinion of another witness on the period that has been described.Jean Tarrou, whose acquaintance we have already made at the beginning of this narrative, had come to Oran some weeks before and was staying in a big hotel in the center of the town.Apparently he had private means and was not engaged in business.But though he gradually became a familiar figure in our midst, no one knew where he hailed from or what had brought him to Oran.He was often to be seen in public and at the beginning of spring was seen on one or other of the beaches almost every day; obviously he was fond of swimming.Good-humored, always ready with a smile, he seemed an addict of all normal pleasures without being their slave.In fact, the only habit he was known to have was that of cultivating the society of the Spanish dancers and musicians who abound in our town."
"他的笔记本里记载着我们在最初这段奇怪的日子里共同经历的事情，有点像纪事。但这种纪事很特别，因为作者描述得似乎很保守，乍看起来人们定会认为塔鲁习惯于从望远镜的另一端以别样的角度来观察人和事。在那些混乱的日子里，他把一般历史学家不关注的事情记录了下来。显然，人们可能会责怪他性格古怪，怀疑他是否心理正常。然而，不可否认的是，这些有点儿像每日随笔似的笔记给这一时期的纪事提供大量的看起来微小实则却非常重要的细节，而这些细节的古怪离奇也使读者不会匆忙地对这个单身汉作出判断。","His notebooks comprise a sort of chronicle of those strange early days we all lived through.But an unusual type of chronicle, since the writer seems to make a point of understatement, and at first sight we might almost imagine that Tarrou had a habit of observing events and people through the wrong end of a telescope.In those chaotic times he set himself to recording the history of what the normal historian passes over.Obviously we may deplore this curious kink in his character and suspect in him a lack of proper feeling.All the same, it is undeniable that these notebooks, which form a sort of discursive diary, supply the chronicler of the period with a host of seeming-trivial details which yet have their importance, and whose very oddity should be enough to prevent the reader from passing hasty judgment on this singular man."
"让·塔鲁从他来到奥兰之日起就开始了他的记录。记录一开始就对这个本身很丑陋的城市流露出一种出奇的满意。里面细致描绘了装饰市政府的两只铜狮，也对这里缺乏树木、房屋简陋、城市布局荒谬的状况作了恰当的评论。塔鲁的描述中还夹杂着一些他在公交车上和马路上听到的谈论，但从不加以评论——只是下文提到的关于一个名叫坎普斯的人的对话除外。这是两个公交车售票员之间的闲聊。","The earliest entries made by Jean Tarrou synchronize with his coming to Oran.From the outset they reveal a paradoxical satisfaction at the discovery of a town so intrinsically ugly.We find in them a minute description of the two bronze lions adorning the Municipal Office, and appropriate comments on the lack of trees, the hideousness of the houses, and the absurd lay-out of the town.Tarrou sprinkles his descriptions with bits of conversation overheard in streetcars and in the streets, never adding a comment on them except—this comes somewhat later—in the report of a dialogue concerning a man named Camps.It was a chat between two streetcar conductors."
"“你认识坎普斯，对吧？”其中的一个售票员问。“坎普斯？那个留着黑胡子的高个儿小伙子吗？”“就是他。一个铁路扳道工。”“哦，是的，我想起来了。”“唉，他死了。”“啊？什么时候死的？”“在那场老鼠事件后。”“不会吧！他是怎么死的？”“我说不清楚。某种热病吧。当然，他本来身体就不好。腋下又长了脓肿，这要了他的命，大概是这样。”“但是，他看起来与别人没有两样啊。”“我可不这么认为。他的肺不好，却常常在市乐队吹长号。他的肺可受不了吹长号这种活儿。”","“You knew Camps, didn’t you?” asked one of them.“Camps?A tall chap with a black mustache?”“That’s him.A switchman.”“Ah yes, I remember now.”“Well, he’s dead.”“Oh?When did he die?”“After that business about the rats.”“You don’t say so!What did he die of?”“I couldn’t say exactly.Some kind of fever.Of course, he never was what you might call fit.He got abscesses under the arms, and they did him in, it seems.”“Still, he didn’t look that different from other people.”“I wouldn’t say that.He had a weak chest and he used to play the trombone in the town band.It’s hard on the lungs, blowing a trombone.”"
"“哦，一个肺部虚弱的人吹这样的大乐器对身体没什么好处。”","“Ah, if you’ve got weak lungs, it don’t do you any good, blowing down a big instrument like that.”"
"记下这个对话后，塔鲁提出了疑问：坎普斯为什么明知参加市乐队对身体不好却仍要参加？又是什么难以理解的动机促使他冒着生命的危险参加周日早上的游行演奏？","After jotting down this dialogue Tarrou went on to speculate why Camps had joined a band when it was so clearly inadvisable, and what obscure motive had led him to risk his life for the sake of parading the streets on Sunday mornings."
"我们猜测，塔鲁对他房间窗户对面的阳台上每天出现的那小小的一幕很有好感。他所住的旅馆房间朝着一条小巷，那里总有几只猫在墙影下睡着觉。每天午饭时间刚过，大多数人都呆在屋里睡午觉的时候，街对面的阳台上就会出现一个行动矫健的矮老头。他有着军人般的架势，身材挺拔，喜欢穿军队式的服装；一头雪白的头发总是梳得整整齐齐的。他靠在阳台上，朝下面喊：“小猫眯！小猫眯！”声音既高傲又亲切。那几只猫咪睡眼惺忪地抬头朝他眨眨眼，但并没有移动身子。然后，他开始将些纸撕成碎片，撒落到小街上去。这些飘飘洒洒的白纸蝴蝶引得这些猫上前，抬起爪子想抓住最后的纸屑。接下来，老头会对准这些猫使劲吐唾沫，一旦唾沫弹击中了猫，他就会高兴得笑起来。最后，塔鲁似乎已经完全着迷于这个城市的商业魅力了，这里的市容、活动，甚至各种娱乐都像是受到商业支配似的。这种特质——他在笔记里用的是这个词——得到了塔鲁的赞赏。确实，他的一段赞美之辞还用上了这样的感叹作为结束语：“总算不虚此行！”","We gather that Tarrou was agreeably impressed by a little scene that took place daily on the balcony of a house facing his window.His room at the hotel looked on to a small side street and there were always several cats sleeping in the shadow of the walls.Every day, soon after lunch, at a time when most people stayed indoors, enjoying a siesta, a dapper little old man stepped out on the balcony on the other side of the street.He had a soldierly bearing, very erect, and affected a military style of dressing; his snow-white hair was always brushed to perfect smoothness.Leaning over the balcony he would call: “Pussy! Pussy!” in a voice at once haughty and endearing.The cats blinked up at him with sleep-pale eyes, but made no move as yet.He then proceeded to tear some paper into scraps and let them fall into the street; interested by the fluttering shower of white butterflies, the cats came forward, lifting tentative paws toward the last scraps of paper.Then, taking careful aim, the old man would spit vigorously at the cats and, whenever a liquid missile hit the quarry, would beam with delight.Lastly, Tarrou seemed to have been quite fascinated by the commercial character of the town, whose aspect, activities, and even pleasures all seemed to be dictated by considerations of business.This idiosyncrasy—the term he uses in his diary—was warmly approved of by Tarrou; indeed, one of his appreciative comments ends on the exclamation: “At last!”"
"在这位旅客这一时期的笔记里，只有这些段落似乎流露出了他的真情。如不细读，这些文字所蕴含的意义与真诚很可能会被忽略。例如，在描述一个旅馆出纳员因为发现一只死老鼠而记错账目的事情后，塔鲁又写了几句：“问题是：怎样才能不浪费时间呢？答案：一直都要非常清楚什么是浪费时间。做到这一点的方法：在牙医的候诊室里，坐在不舒服的椅子上呆上几天；在自家阳台上度过整个周日下午；参加用自己听不懂的语言讲授的讲座；选一条路程最远又最不方便的路线乘火车去旅行，当然是一路站着；在剧院售票处前排队而没买到票等等。”","These are the only passages in which our visitor’s record, at this period, strikes a seemingly personal note.Its significance and the earnestness behind it might escape the reader on a casual perusal.For example, after describing how the discovery of a dead rat led the hotel cashier to make an error in his bill, Tarrou added: “Query: How contrive not to waste one’s time?Answer: By being fully aware of it all the while.Ways in which this can be done: By spending one’s days on an uneasy chair in a dentist’s waiting-room; by remaining on one’s balcony all a Sunday afternoon; by listening to lectures in a language one doesn’t know; by traveling by the longest and least-convenient train routes, and of course standing all the way; by lining up at the box-office of theaters and then not buying a seat; and so forth.”"
"然后，紧接在这些奇怪的想法和表达之后，笔记又详细地描述了这个城里的公交服务，包括车的外形结构、它们模糊不清的颜色以及车里永恒不变的肮脏——这种描述以一句不知所云的“很怪”作为结束。","Then, immediately following these eccentricities of thought and expression, we come on a detailed description of the streetcar service in the town, the structure of the cars, their indeterminate color, their unvarying dirtiness—and he concludes his observations with a “Very odd,” which explains—nothing."
"下面再看看塔鲁对于老鼠事件的评论。","So much by way of introduction to Tarrou’s comments on the phenomenon of the rats."
"“对面的矮老头今天很不高兴。猫都不见了。死老鼠散落在街头的情景本该激起它们捕猎的本性，总之，它们都消失不见了。在我看来，它们不可能去吃死老鼠了。我记得猫是厌恶死东西的。尽管如此，它们可能仍旧正在地窖里忙着追捕老鼠——因此造成矮老头的困境。他的头发梳得不那么整齐，人看起来也不那么灵敏，不那么像军人了。他看上去忧心忡忡的。过了一会儿，他进屋去了。但进屋前他又吐了口唾沫——毫无目标。","“The little old fellow opposite is quite disconsolate today.There are no more cats.The sight of all those dead rats strewn about the street may have excited their hunting instinct; anyhow, they all have vanished.To my thinking, there’s no question of their eating the dead rats.Mine, I remember, turned up their noses at dead things.All the same, they’re probably busy hunting in the cellars—hence the old boy’s plight.His hair isn’t as well brushed as usual, and he looks less alert, less military.You can see he is worried.After a few moments he went back into the room.But first he spat once—on emptiness."
"“今天城里有一辆电车因为车上发现了死老鼠而中途停了下来。（问题：死老鼠是怎么到车上去的？）两三个女人立即下了车。死老鼠被扔出车去。车继续往前行驶。","“In town today a streetcar was stopped because a dead rat had been found in it.(Query: How did it get there?)Two or three women promptly alighted.The rat was thrown out.The car went on."
"“旅馆里的守夜人，一个头脑冷静之人，告诉我这些老鼠一定是灾难的先兆。‘当老鼠离开船时……’我回答他说，轮船中有这种情况是正常的，但在城市里，这种情况还从未有过。但他依然坚持自己的观点。我问他我们可能会有什么‘灾难’。他也说不上来；灾难总是突然降临。不过要是发生地震，他也不会感到吃惊。我认为这是有可能的，于是他又问我这是否吓着我了。‘我唯一感兴趣的是，’我对他说，‘求得内心的安宁。’他完全理解我的意思。","“The night watchman at the hotel, a level-headed man, assured me that all these rats meant trouble coming.‘When the rat leave a ship...’ I replied that this held good for ships, but for towns it hadn’t yet been demonstrated.But he stuck to his point.I asked what sort of ‘trouble’ we might expect.That he couldn’t say; disasters always come out of the blue.But he wouldn’t be surprised if there were an earthquake brewing.I admitted that was possible, and then he asked if the prospect didn’t alarm me.‘The only thing I’m interested in,’ I told him, ‘is acquiring peace of mind.’ He understood me perfectly."
"“我发现在这个旅馆吃饭的一家人很有趣。父亲是个瘦高个，总是穿着黑衣服，打着硬领结。他头顶光秃秃的，两边有两撮灰白的头发。他有着圆圆的小眼睛、窄窄的鼻子和僵直的嘴，就像一只很有修养的猫头鹰。他总是第一个到达餐厅门口，侧身让他的妻子——一个小黑鼠般的女人——先进来，然后自己进来，一双儿女紧跟其后，打扮得像两只上台表演的小狗。到了餐桌旁，等妻子坐下后，他才坐下，直到这时两只小狗才可以坐上椅子。他对家人不用昵称，对妻子彬彬有礼地说些恶毒话，对两个孩子则直率地表达自己的看法。‘尼科尔，你举止太不得体了。’","“I find a family that has its meals in this hotel quite interesting.The father is a tall, thin man, always dressed in black and wearing a starched collar.The top of his head is bald, with two tufts of gray hair on each side.His small, beady eyes, narrow nose, and hard, straight mouth make him look like a well-brought-up owl.He is always first at the door of the restaurant, stands aside to let his wife—a tiny woman, like a black mouse—go in, and then comes in himself with a small boy and girl, dressed like performing poodles, at his heels.When they are at the table he remains standing till his wife is seated and only then the two poodles can perch themselves on their chairs.He uses no terms of endearment to his family, addresses politely spiteful remarks to his wife, and bluntly tells the kids what he thinks of them.‘Nicole, you’re behaving quite disgracefully.’ "
"“小女孩就要哭出来了——这是必然的。这天早上，小男孩对老鼠的事情很起劲，想要说说这事。","“The little girl is on the brink of tears—which is as it should be.This morning the small boy was all excitement about the rats, and started saying something on the subject."
"“‘菲利普，不要在吃饭时谈老鼠。以后我不许你提这个词。’‘你父亲说得对，’黑鼠附和着说。","“‘Philippe, one doesn’t talk of rats at table.For the future I forbid you to use the word.’ ‘Your father’s right,’ approved the mouse."
"“两只小狗埋头到盘子里去了，猫头鹰就敷衍地点点头表示感谢。","“The two poodles buried their noses in their plates, and the owl acknowledged thanks by a curt, perfunctory nod."
"“尽管有这个典型的例子，但城里大家都在谈论老鼠事件，当地的报纸也介入了。本市新闻栏目的话题通常多种多样，而现在整栏都是反对市政当局的内容。‘我们的市政官员们知道这些腐烂的老鼠尸体对人们构成了严重的威胁吗？’旅馆经理成天只谈此事。不过，他也有个人的隐忧，在一家三星级宾馆的电梯里发现老鼠在他看来简直是末日。我安慰他说：‘可是，要知道，大家都面临这种状况。’","“This excellent example notwithstanding, everybody in town is talking about the rats, and the local newspaper has taken a hand.The town-topics column, usually very varied, is now devoted exclusively to a campaign against the local authorities.‘Are our city fathers aware that the decaying bodies of these rodents constitute a grave danger to the population?’ The manager of the hotel can talk of nothing else.But he has a personal grievance, too; that dead rats should be found in the elevator of a three-star hotel seems to him the end of all things.To console him, I said: ‘But, you know, everybody’s in the same boat.’ "
"‘就是这样，’他回答说，‘现在大家都一样，人人自危。’","‘That’s just it,’ he replied.‘Now we’re like everybody else.’ "
"“是他第一个给我讲起这种引起慌乱的奇怪热症的爆发。他的客房女佣中有一人患上了这种病。","“He was the first to tell me about the outbreak of this queer kind of fever which is causing much alarm.One of his chambermaids has got it."
"‘不过可以肯定，这不会传染。’他连忙向我保证说。我告诉他这对我无所谓。‘啊，我知道，先生。你和我一样，是位宿命论者。’","‘But I feel sure it’s not contagious,’ he hastened to assure me.I told him it was all the same to me.‘Ah, I understand, sir.You’re like me, you’re a fatalist.’ "
"“我从未发表过这样的言论，而且，我也不是宿命论者。我这样告诉他……”　","“I had said nothing of the kind and, what’s more, am not a fatalist.I told him so....”"
"从这时起，塔鲁在笔记中开始较为详细地记述令众人极度焦虑的奇怪的高烧症。他记下了那个矮老头终于在老鼠停止出现后又见到了那些消失多日的猫，并且正耐心地改进他的唾沫攻击术，接着塔鲁又提到听说已经出现了十几个高烧病人，大多都不治身亡。","From this point onwards Tarrou’s entries deal in some detail with the curious fever that was causing much anxiety among the public.When noting that the little old man, now that the rats had ceased appearing, had regained his cats and was studiously perfecting his shooting, Tarrou adds that a dozen or so cases of this fever were known to have occurred, and most had ended fatally."
"为了更好地理解故事叙述者后面的讲述，这里有必要插入一段塔鲁对里厄医生的描写。据笔者判断，这个描述非常精确。","For the light it may throw on the narrative that follows, Tarrou’s description of Dr. Rieux may be suitably inserted here.So far as the narrator can judge, it is fairly accurate."
"“看起来三十五岁左右。中等个子。宽肩膀。近乎长方的脸盘。黑色的眼睛目光沉稳，下颌突出。鼻子大而坚挺。黑色的头发，剪得短短的。嘴角微翘，嘴唇很厚，通常紧闭着。他皮肤黝黑，胳膊和双手也是黑黑的，还总穿着黑色但得体的西装，让人想起西西里的农民。","“Looks about thirty-five.Moderate height.Broad shoulders.Almost rectangular face.Dark, steady eyes, but prominent jaws.A biggish, well-modeled nose.Black hair, cropped very close.A curving mouth with thick, usually tight-set lips.With his tanned skin, the black down on his hands and arms, the dark but becoming suits he always wears, he reminds one of a Sicilian peasant."
"“他走路很快。过马路时，他走下人行道也不改变步伐，但是十有八九他会在跨上对面的人行道时轻轻一跳。他心不在焉，开车时常常是车子转弯后转向灯还亮着。他从不戴帽子。看起来知识渊博。”","“He walks quickly.When crossing a street, he steps off the sidewalk without changing his pace, but two out of three times makes a little hop when he steps on to the sidewalk on the other side.He is absentminded and, when driving his car, often leaves his side-signals on after he has turned a corner.Always bareheaded.Looks knowledgeable.”"
"第三章","Chapter 3"
"塔鲁记录的描述是正确的。里厄医生只是明显感觉事态已经变得严峻了。叫人把看门人的尸体运走之后，他曾打电话给理查德，询问他对腹股沟淋巴结炎症的看法。","Tarrou’s figures were correct.Dr. Rieux was only too well aware of the serious turn things had taken.After seeing to the isolation of the concierge’s body, he had rung up Richard and asked what he made of these inguinal-fever cases."
"“我一点儿也看不懂，”理查德说，“有两个病人已去世了，一个是在发病后两天，另一个是在发病后三天死去的。而我在第二个病人得病的第二天去看望他时时，他看起来病情已有所好转。”","“I can make nothing of them,” Richard confessed.“There have been two deaths, one in forty-eight hours, the other in three days.And the second patient showed all the signs of convalescence when I visited him on the second day.”"
"“如有别的病例，请告诉我。”里厄说。","“Please let me know if you have other cases,” Rieux said."
"他又打电话问了其他几个同行。询问的结果是，他了解到几天内已出现大约二十例相同的病例。所有的病例几乎都是致命的。于是，他建议奥兰医学联合会会长理查德叫人把新发现的病人隔离开来。","He rang up some other colleagues.As a result of these inquiries he gathered that there had been some twenty cases of the same type within the last few days.Almost all had ended fatally.He then advised Richard, who was chairman of the local Medical Association, to have any fresh cases put into isolation wards."
"“对不起，”理查德说，“我办不到。只有省长才能颁布这样的命令。而且，你有什么理由认为这有传染危险？”","“Sorry,” Richard said, “but I can’t do anything about it.An order to that effect can be issued only by the Prefect.Anyhow, what grounds have you for supposing there’s danger of contagion?”"
"“没有什么明确的理由。不过这些症状确实令人担忧。”","“No definite grounds.But the symptoms are definitely alarming.”"
"但是理查德反复说“这些措施不在他的权利范围之内”。他最多只能向省长汇报这一情况。","Richard, however, repeated that “such measures were outside his province.”The most he could do was to put the matter up to the Prefect."
"他们在谈论这些事情的时候，天气却变得更加糟糕起来。看门人死后的第二天，天空乌云密布，骤然下了几场倾盆大雨，每场骤雨过后就是暴热。大海也变了，它失去了往日的深蓝色，在黑压压的天空下闪着刺眼的白光。这讨厌的春日的潮热让所有人都盼着干净的、干燥的炎炎夏日。在这座如蜗牛般隆起在高原上、几乎全城背海的城市上空，笼罩着一种无精打采的气氛。被包围在一排排的白墙之间，走在两旁尽是布满灰尘的店铺的街道中，坐在肮脏发黄的电车上，人们感觉到处都像是被这种天气给困住了。但是，里厄的那个年老的西班牙病人却没有这种感觉，他倒是非常欢迎这种天气。","But while these talks were going on, the weather changed for the worse.On the day following old Michel’s death the sky clouded up and there were brief torrential downpours, each of which was followed by some hours of muggy heat.The aspect of the sea, too, changed; its dark-blue translucency had gone and, under the lowering sky, it had steely or silvery glints that hurt the eyes to look at.The damp heat of the spring made everyone long for the coming of the dry, clean summer heat.On the town, humped snail-wise on its plateau and shut off almost everywhere from the sea, a mood of listlessness descended.Hemmed in by lines and lines of whitewashed walls, walking between rows of dusty shops, or riding in the dingy yellow streetcars, you felt, as it were, trapped by the climate.This, however, was not the case with Rieux’s old Spanish patient, who welcomed this weather with enthusiasm."
"“热得难熬，”他说，“但这对支气管倒不错。”","“It cooks you,” he said.“Just the thing for asthma.”"
"天气的确“热得难熬”，但就像发烧似的。确实，全城都在发烧，这至少是里厄挥之不去的印象，那时他驾车去费代尔布街参加科塔尔自杀未遂的调查。他觉得自己的这种感觉毫无理由，因而把它归咎于精神疲劳。他那时有太多的烦心事。事实上，他该控制一下，让自己的头脑镇定下来。","Certainly it “cooked you,” but exactly like a fever.Indeed, “the whole town was running a temperature; such anyhow was the impression Dr. Rieux could not shake off as he drove to the rue Faidherbe for the inquiry into Cottard’s attempted suicide.That this impression was unreasonable he knew, and he attributed it to nervous exhaustion; he had certainly his full share of worries just at present.In fact, it was high time to put the brakes on and try to get his nerves into some sort of order."
"他到达目的地时，发现警官还没有到。格朗在楼梯口迎接他，叫医生上他家去等着，把门开着。这个市政府职员有两间房，陈设都很简单。唯一引人注目的是一个书架和一块小黑板，书架上面摆放着两三本字典，黑板上写着已被檫得看不太清的几个字：“花香四溢的林阴大道”。","On reaching his destination he found that the police inspector hadn’t turned up yet.Grand, who met him on the landing, suggested they should wait in his place, leaving the door open.The municipal clerk had two rooms, both very sparsely furnished.The only objects to catch the eye were a bookshelf on which lay two or three dictionaries, and a small blackboard on which one could just read two half-obliterated words: “flowery avenues.”"
"格朗告诉医生说科塔尔昨晚睡得很好。但早上起来时，科塔尔感觉头很痛，心情也很低落。格朗自己也显得疲惫和心烦。他在房间里不停地走来走去，把放在桌上的一个夹满稿纸的文件夹打开来又合上去。","Grand announced that Cottard had had a good night.But he’d waked up this morning with pains in his head and feeling very low.Grand, too, looked tired and overwrought; he kept pacing up and down the room, opening and closing a portfolio crammed with sheets of manuscript that lay on the table."
"同时，他又告诉医生说他真的不太了解科塔尔，只是认为他有点小积蓄。科塔尔是个古怪的人。长期以来，他们之间的关系只是在楼梯上遇见时打声招呼罢了。","Meanwhile, however, he informed the doctor that he really knew very little about Cottard, but believed him to have private means in a small way.Cottard was a queer bird.For a long while their relations went no farther than wishing each other good-day when they met on the stairs."
"“我只跟他谈过两次话。几天前，我在楼梯口打翻了一盒带回家来的彩色粉笔。这些粉笔有红色的，有蓝色的。这时科塔尔走出房来，帮我把粉笔捡起来。他问我拿彩色粉笔作什么用。”","“I’ve only had two conversations with him.Some days ago I upset a box of colored chalks I was bringing home, on the landing.They were red and blue chalks.Just then Cottard came out of his room and he helped me pick them up.He asked me what I wanted colored chalks for.”"
"格朗向他解释说自己想温习一下拉丁语。中学时他学过拉丁语，但现在已忘得差不多了。","Grand had then explained to him that he was trying to brush up his Latin.He’d learned it at school, of course, but his memories had grown blurred."
"“你瞧，医生，有人告诉我了解拉丁语可以更好地理解法语词的真正含义。”","“You see, doctor, I’ve been told that a knowledge of Latin gives one a better understanding of the real meanings of French words.”"
"因此，他把拉丁语单词写在他的黑板上，用蓝粉笔重抄一遍单词中代表性、数、格变化的部分，又用红粉笔再抄一遍单词中永不变化的部分。","So he wrote Latin words on his blackboard, then copied out again in blue chalk the part of each word that changed in conjugation or declension, and in red chalk the part of the word that never varied."
"“我不确定科塔尔是否完全听得懂，但他显得很感兴趣，并向我要了一支红粉笔。这使我感到很惊讶，但毕竟——当然，我猜不到他会用它来干什么。”","“I’m not sure if Cottard followed this very clearly, but he seemed interested and asked me for a red chalk.That rather surprised me, but after all—Of course I couldn’t guess the use he’d put it to.”"
"里厄想问他们第二次谈话的内容。正在这时，警官带着警员来了，说是想先听格朗说说。医生注意到格朗在提到科塔尔时，总是称他为“不幸的人”，甚至一度用上“他那冷酷的决定”这种词。在谈论这次企图自杀的动机时，格朗在用词上显得有点谨慎起来。最后他用了“内心的痛苦”一词。警官问科塔尔的行为方式上是否有什么地方显示出他所谓的“自杀企图”。","Rieux asked what was the subject of their second conversation.But just then the inspector came, accompanied by a clerk, and said he wished to begin by hearing Grand’s statement.The doctor noticed that Grand, when referring to Cottard, always called him “the unfortunate man,” and at one moment used even the expression “his grim resolve.”When discussing the possible motives for the attempted suicide, Grand showed an almost finical anxiety over his choice of words.Finally he elected for the expression “a secret grief.”The inspector asked if there had been anything in Cottard’s manner that suggested what he called his “intent to felo-de-se.”"
"“昨天他来敲我家的门，”格朗说，“来问我要火柴。我给了他一盒。他说他很抱歉打扰了我，又说他希望我不会介意，因为我们是邻居。他向我保证一定会归还火柴，但我叫他留着。”","“He knocked at my door yesterday,” Grand said, “and asked me for a match.I gave him a box.He said he was sorry to disturb me but that, as we were neighbors, he hoped I wouldn’t mind.He assured me he’d bring back my box, but I told him to keep it.”"
"警官问格朗是否注意到科塔尔有什么异常之处。","The inspector asked Grand if he’d noticed anything queer about Cottard."
"“我觉得他的异常之处是，他似乎总想开口对我说些什么。但他应该是看到了我一直在忙。”格朗转向里厄，有点儿不好意思地接着说：“一件私事。”","“What struck me as queer was that he always seemed to want to start a conversation.But he should have seen I was busy with my work.”Grand turned to Rieux and added rather shyly: “Some private work.”"
"警官又说他必须去见见病人，听听他的说法。里厄认为最好先让科塔尔有个准备。当里厄走进科塔尔的房间时，看到他正穿着一件灰色的法兰绒睡衣坐在床上，脸上带着惶恐的神情盯着门口。","The inspector now said that he must see the invalid and hear what he had to say.Rieux thought it would be wiser to prepare Cottard for the visit.When he entered the bedroom he found Cottard, who was wearing a gray flannel nightshirt, sitting up in bed and gazing at the door with a scared expression on his face."
"“警察来了，是吗？”","“It’s the police, isn’t it?”"
"“是的，”里厄说，“但是别紧张。只需完成几项常规调查，之后就没你的事了。”","“Yes,” Rieux said, “but don’t get flustered.There are only some formalities to be gone through, and then you’ll be left in peace.”"
"科塔尔回答说，这完全没有必要，况且他也不喜欢警察。","Cottard replied that all this was quite needless, to his thinking, and anyhow he didn’t like the police."
"里厄表现出有些生气的样子。","Rieux showed some irritation."
"“我也不喜欢警察。只需尽量简短而真实地回答一些提问就完事了。”","“I don’t love them either.It’s only a matter of answering a few questions as briefly and correctly as you can, and then you’ll be through with it.”"
"科塔尔没说什么，里厄就转身朝门口走去。他刚跨出一步，这个矮胖子就叫他回来，并在他走到床边时抓住他的双手。","Cottard said nothing and Rieux began to move to the door.He had hardly taken a step when the little man called him back and, as soon as he was at the bedside, gripped his hands."
"“他们不会为难一个病人，一个上吊过的人，是吗，医生？”","“They can’t be rough with an invalid, a man who’s hanged himself, can they, doctor?”"
"里厄低头看了他一会儿，然后向他保证说从来就没有这样的事，况且无论如何他都会保护他的病人。科塔尔似乎松了口气，于是里厄出去叫警官进来。","Rieux gazed down at him for a moment, then assured him that there was no question of anything like that, and in any case he was here to protect his patient.This seemed to relieve Cottard, and Rieux went out to get the inspector."
"警官宣读了格朗的证词后，就叫科塔尔说说他自杀的真实动机。他没有抬眼看警官，只是回答说那正是因为“内心的痛苦”。警官接着追问他是否还想“再犯”。科塔尔激动起来，说他当然不会再这么做了，只想别人不要来烦他。","After Grand’s deposition had been read out, Cottard was asked to state the exact motive of his act.He merely replied, without looking at the police officer, that “a secret grief” described it well enough.The inspector then asked him peremptorily if he intended to “have another go at it.”Showing more animation, Cottard said certainly not, his one wish was to be left in peace."
"“我要提醒你，先生，”警官气愤地说，“现在是你在烦别人。”里厄朝他做了个手势，叫他不要再说下去，他也就没再说什么。","“Allow me to point out, my man,” the police officer rejoined with asperity, “that just now it’s you who’re troubling the peace of others.”Rieux signed to him not to continue, and he left it at that."
"“白白浪费了一个小时！”警官走出去关上房门后，叹了口气说，“你想啊，自从大家议论这个高烧症的事情以来，我们警察要考虑些别的问题。”","“A good hour wasted!” the inspector sighed when the door closed behind them.“As you can guess, we’ve other things to think about, what with this fever everybody’s talking of.”"
"他接着问医生这座城市是否面临严重威胁，里厄回答说他不清楚。“那一定是天气的缘故，”警官下结论说，“就是这样。”","He then asked the doctor if there was any serious danger to the town; Rieux answered that he couldn’t say.“It must be the weather,” the police officer decided.“That’s what it is.”"
"这毫无疑问是天气的缘故。日子慢慢地过去，每样东西摸起来都感觉很黏，而里厄每次出诊后都感觉他的忧虑在不断增加。当天晚上，郊区那个老病人的邻居按着腹股沟开始呕吐，发着高烧胡言乱语起来。淋巴结肿得比米歇尔的大得多。其中一个正在流脓，很快就溃烂得像个熟透了的果子。里厄一回到家，就给行政区的医药库打电话。在他当天的工作记录上只写着：“答复说没药。”这个城市各个地方都有人叫他去看类似的病人。很显然，必须割开这些脓肿。划开一个十字切口，淋巴结就流出带血的脓水来。病人四肢尽力向外叉开，继续流着血。腹部和腿部出现黑色的斑块，有时淋巴结停止出脓，继而又重新肿大起来。通常病人都会在一种腐烂的臭气中死去。","No doubt it was the weather.As the day wore on, everything grew sticky to the touch, and Rieux felt his anxiety increasing after each visit.That evening a neighbor of his old patient in the suburbs started vomiting, pressing his hand to his groin, and running a high fever accompanied by delirium.The ganglia were much bigger than M. Michel’s.One of them was beginning to suppurate, and presently split open like an overripe fruit.On returning to his apartment, Rieux rang up the medical-stores depot for the district.In his professional diary for the day the only entry was: “Negative reply.”Already he was receiving calls for similar cases from various parts of the town.Obviously the abscesses had to be lanced.Two crisscross strokes, and the ganglion disgorged a mixture of blood and pus.Their limbs stretched out as far as they could manage, the sick man went on bleeding.Dark patches appeared on their legs and stomachs; sometimes a ganglion would stop suppurating, then suddenly swell again.Usually the sick man died, in a stench of corruption."
"对老鼠事件曾经大事渲染的地方报纸，现在对这些情况却只字不提。因为老鼠死在街上，人死在屋里。而报纸只关注街面上的事。在这个时候，省政府和市政府的官员们开始聚在一起商议起来。假如每个医生只遇到一两个这样的病例，没有人会想到要采取行动。而一旦把这些数字都加起来，总数却是很惊人的。不到几天工夫，病例迅速增长起来，那些关注这种怪病的人都清楚一场真正的瘟疫到来了。正是在这个时候，里厄的一位年纪比他大得多的同行卡斯特尔来找他。","The local press, so lavish of news about the rats, now had nothing to say.For rats died in the street; men in their homes.And newspapers are concerned only with the street.Meanwhile, government and municipal officials were putting their heads together.So long as each individual doctor had come across only two or three cases, no one had thought of taking action.But it was merely a matter of adding up the figures and, once this had been done, the total was startling.In a very few days the number of cases had risen by leaps and bounds, and it became evident to all observers of this strange malady that a real epidemic had set in.This was the state of affairs when Castel, one of Rieux’s colleagues and a much older man than he, came to see him."
"“当然，”他对里厄说，“你知道这是什么病。”","“Naturally,” he said to Rieux, “you know what it is.”"
"“我在等验尸结果。”","“I’m waiting for the result of the post-mortems.”"
"“嗯，我知道。我倒不需要任何验尸报告。我曾在中国做过很长一段时间的医生，而且二十年前在巴黎也见过这样的病例。只不过没人敢在这个时候直接说出这些病症的名字罢了。当然，这是禁忌。大家不该恐慌，也绝不会恐慌。而且，就像我的一个同事所说，‘真是不可思议。大家都知道这种病在西欧已经绝迹了。’是的，大家都知道——除了死人。那么，里厄，你和我一样都清楚这是什么病。”","“Well, I know.And I don’t need any post-mortems.I was in China for a good part of my career, and I saw some cases in Paris twenty years ago.Only no one dared to call them by their name on that occasion.The usual taboo, of course; the public mustn’t be alarmed, that wouldn’t do at all.And then, as one of my colleagues said, ‘It’s unthinkable.Everyone knows it’s ceased to appear in western Europe.’ Yes, everyone knew that—except the dead men.Come now, Rieux, you know as well as I do what it is.”"
"里厄沉思着。他从诊所的窗口眺望着远处地平线上半包围住海湾的悬崖峭壁。天空虽然蓝蓝的，但颜色晦暗，并随着夜幕的降临而渐渐淡了下去。“是的，卡斯特尔，”他回答说，“这是难以置信。但一切都表明这是鼠疫。”","Rieux pondered.He was looking out of the window of his surgery, at the tall cliff that closed the half-circle of the bay on the far horizon.Though blue, the sky had a dull sheen that was softening as the light declined.“Yes, Castel,” he replied.“It’s hardly credible.But everything points to its being plague.”"
"卡斯特尔起身朝门口走去。","Castel got up and began walking toward the door."
"“你知道，”这位老医生说，“人们会对我们说什么呢？会说它很久以前就从温带地区国家消失了。”","“You know,” the old doctor said, “what they’re going to tell us?That it vanished from temperate countries long ago.”"
"“‘消失’？这个词到底是什么意思？”里厄耸了耸肩说。","“‘Vanished’?What does that word really mean?” Rieux shrugged his shoulders."
"“是呀。别忘了。不到二十年前，在巴黎也发生过鼠疫。”","“Yes.And don’t forget.Just under twenty years ago, in Paris too.”"
"“没错。但愿这次的情况不会比那次更糟。不过这的确难以置信。”","“Right.Let’s hope it won’t prove any worse this time than it did then.But really it’s incredible.”"
"第四章","Chapter 4"
"“鼠疫”这个词第一次被说出了口。写到这里，且让笔者谈谈站在窗户边的伯纳德·里厄医生内心感到疑惑与诧异的原因——他的反应和这里的大多数市民一样，只是程度上有些不同而已。大家都知道瘟疫是人间常事，但人们很难相信好端端地它就从天而降，突然压到我们头上。历史上发生过鼠疫的次数和战争的次数同样多，而鼠疫和战争同样都使人们感到诧异。","The word “plague” had just been uttered for the first time.At this stage of the narrative, with Dr. Bernard Rieux standing at his window, the narrator may, perhaps, be allowed to justify the doctor’s uncertainty and surprise—since, with very slight differences, his reaction was the same as that of the great majority of our townsfolk.Everybody knows that pestilences have a way of recurring in the world; yet somehow we find it hard to believe in ones that crash down on our heads from a blue sky.There have been as many plagues as wars in history; yet always plagues and wars take people equally by surprise."
"其实，跟这里的市民一样，里厄对此不知所措，因此我们应该理解他面对事实时的彷徨犹豫，也应该理解他在恐惧与信心的冲突中经受怎样的煎熬。战争爆发时，人们说：“这太愚蠢了，这很快就会过去。”但是，尽管战争可能是“太愚蠢”，却并不会因此而很快结束。愚蠢总能自行其道；假如人们不总是只站在自己的角度看问题，就应该明白这一点。","In fact, like our fellow citizens, Rieux was caught off his guard, and we should understand his hesitations in the light of this fact; and similarly understand how he was torn between conflicting fears and confidence.When a war breaks out, people say: “It’s too stupid; it can’t last long.”But though a war may well be “too stupid,” that doesn’t prevent its lasting.Stupidity has a knack of getting its way; as we should see if we were not always so much wrapped up in ourselves."
"但在这个问题上，这里的市民和大家一样，只站在自己的立场看问题；换句话说，他们是人道主义者，他们不相信瘟疫。瘟疫不是人类所能控制的，因此人们告诉自己，瘟疫只是一个心理的妖孽，一个即将消失的噩梦。但是噩梦并不一定消失，在噩梦连连的过程中，正是人类自己消失了，而且最先消失的是那些人道主义者，因为他们没有采取预防措施。不该过多责怪这里的市民，他们只不过是忘了应该审慎一些罢了；他们以为自己能对付任何事情，而这使他们认为瘟疫不可能发生。他们继续做生意，继续安排旅行，继续发表见解。他们怎么会想到有鼠疫这样毁坏前程、取消旅行、阻止意见交流的事发生。他们本来自由自在，可一旦出现瘟疫，谁都没了自由。","In this respect our townsfolk were like everybody else, wrapped up in themselves; in other words they were humanists: they disbelieved in pestilences.A pestilence isn’t a thing made to man’s measure; therefore we tell ourselves that pestilence is a mere bogy of the mind, a bad dream that will pass away.But it doesn’t always pass away and, from one bad dream to another, it is men who pass away, and the humanists first of all, because they haven’t taken their precautions.Our townsfolk were not more to blame than others; they forgot to be modest, that was all, and thought that everything still was possible for them; which presupposed that pestilences were impossible.They went on doing business, arranged for journeys, and formed views.How should they have given a thought to anything like plague, which rules out any future, cancels journeys, silences the exchange of views.They fancied themselves free, and no one will ever be free so long as there are pestilences."
"事实上，即使里厄医生在和他朋友一起时承认有少数散居各处的病人毫无预兆而死于鼠疫，但危险似乎依然只是存在于想象中，并不真实。原因很简单：作为医生，他对生理病痛有自己的理解，想象力就比常人要更丰富一些。从窗口眺望这表面并没大改变的城市，医生感到对未来不仅仅有种轻微的担忧，还有种隐约的不安。","Indeed, even after Dr. Rieux had admitted in his friend’s company that a handful of persons, scattered about the town, had without warning died of plague, the danger still remained fantastically unreal.For the simple reason that, when a man is a doctor, he comes to have his own ideas of physical suffering, and to acquire somewhat more imagination than the average.Looking from his window at the town, outwardly quite unchanged, the doctor felt little more than a faint qualm for the future, a vague unease."
"他竭力回忆他所读过的有关这种疾病的情况。数字从他脑海中浮现出来，他想起历史上已知的三十来次大鼠疫夺去了将近一亿人的生命。可是一亿人死亡又算得了什么？一个人要是打过仗，他很快就不太在意死人这件事了。而人只有亲眼看到死亡才会真正体会死亡，因此历史上报道的一亿具死尸只不过是想象中的一缕青烟而已。医生想起了君士坦丁堡的那场鼠疫，据普罗科匹厄斯记载，仅仅一天就有一万人丧命。一万人大约相当于一个大型电影院所容纳的观众的五倍。是的，这种比拟非常恰当。把走出五座电影院的观众聚集起来，领到一个城市广场上，让他们成堆地死去，这就能清楚了解瘟疫意味着什么了。在这无名尸堆上，至少可以安上几个熟悉的面孔。不过，这当然不可能实现，况且谁认识一万张面孔呢？其实，像普罗科匹厄斯那样的老历史学家记录的数据是不可靠的，这是众所周知的。七十年前，在广东，四万老鼠死于鼠疫，之后疫情蔓延到居民身上。但是，在广东这场鼠疫中，同样也没有可靠的计算老鼠的方法。所能做的只是大概的估算一下，显然很可能有误差。“看看吧，”医生喃喃自语，“假如一只老鼠长十英寸，四万只老鼠首尾相接就能形成一条……”","He tried to recall what he had read about the disease.Figures floated across his memory, and he recalled that some thirty or so great plagues known to history had accounted for nearly a hundred million deaths.But what are a hundred million deaths?When one has served in a war, one hardly knows what a dead man is, after a while.And since a dead man has no substance unless one has actually seen him dead, a hundred million corpses broadcast through history are no more than a puff of smoke in the imagination.The doctor remembered the plague at Constantinople that, according to Procopius, caused ten thousand deaths in a single day.Ten thousand dead made about five times the audience in a biggish cinema.Yes, that was how it should be done.You should collect the people at the exits of five picture-houses, you should lead them to a city square and make them die in heaps if you wanted to get a clear notion of what it means.Then at least you could add some familiar faces to the anonymous mass.But naturally that was impossible to put into practice; moreover, what man knows ten thousand faces?In any case the figures of those old historians, like Procopius, weren’t to be relied on; that was common knowledge.Seventy years ago, at Canton, forty thousand rats died of plague before the disease spread to the inhabitants.But, again, in the Canton epidemic there was no reliable way of counting up the rats.A very rough estimate was all that could be made, with, obviously, a wide margin for error.“Let’s see,” the doctor murmured to himself, “supposing the length of a rat to be ten inches, forty thousand rats placed end to end would make a line of...”"
"他突然停止了思绪。想象漫无边际——这是他现在最不想做的。他告诉自己，几个病例还称不上瘟疫，只不过提醒人们要认真预防。他首先要注意观察到的情况：昏迷和极度虚弱、腹股沟淋巴结炎、特别口渴、胡言乱语、身上有黑斑、体内有撕裂感等等，最后……最后，医生想起了几句话，他突然想到他的医学手册里在描述这些症状后所作的结论：“脉搏变得细弱，重搏脉，断断续续，身子稍微一动就突然断气”。不错，最后，病人命如游丝，而四分之三（他准确地记得这个数字）的病人耐不住性子，稍稍动一动就丝断身亡了。","He pulled himself up sharply.He was letting his imagination play pranks—the last thing wanted just now.A few cases, he told himself, don’t make an epidemic; they merely call for serious precautions.He must fix his mind, first of all, on the observed facts: stupor and extreme prostration, buboes, intense thirst, delirium, dark blotches on the body, internal dilatation, and, in conclusion ...In conclusion, some words came back to the doctor’s mind; aptly enough, the concluding sentence of the description of the symptoms given in his medical handbook: “The pulse becomes fluttering, dicrotic, and intermittent, and death ensues as the result of the slightest movement.”Yes, in conclusion, the patient’s life hung on a thread, and three people out of four (he remembered the exact figures) were too impatient not to make the very slight movement that snapped the thread."
"医生还在凭窗眺望。窗外，春天寒冷的天空透着静谧的光；室内，“鼠疫”这个词的声音一直在静静回荡。医生头脑里显现的这个词不仅仅是个科学用词，而且会呈现出一连串难以置信却又很可能出现的景象，它们和他眼前这座灰黄色的城市极不协调。这个时候，城里的声响不大，有点嘈杂，还算不上喧哗，总之，这些声响属于这座快乐的城市，如果沉闷和快乐可以并存的话。如此随意的安静似乎很容易使人忘却以往那些鼠疫的场景：雅典成为一个空气中散发着臭气，甚至连飞鸟都弃之而去的葬尸场；中国受灾的城市里挤满了默默承受着苦难的病人；马赛的囚犯们把腐烂的尸体堆入深坑；普罗旺斯为了阻挡鼠疫的狂飙筑起了高墙；泥地上铺着潮湿而腐烂的草垫子的君士坦丁堡麻风病院里，人们用钩子把病人从床上拖起来；黑死病肆虐时到处都是戴着口罩的医生，就像过狂欢节一样；米兰公墓里男男女女堆在一起；拉着死尸的卡车隆隆驶过幽灵出没的夜晚的伦敦城——日日夜夜,四处传来经久不息的哀号声。不，所有这些惊恐还不足以扰乱这个春日下午的宁静。一辆看不到的电车发出的叮当声从窗外传来，立刻驱走了医生想象中的残忍和痛苦。只有那大海，在星罗密布的简陋房屋后不断地咆哮着，了解了人世间所有的不安与危险。凝视着海湾方向，里厄医生想起了卢克莱修所描述的雅典人在海滩上架起的用来焚烧疫病后死尸的柴火堆。晚上运来了尸体，但柴火堆上没有足够的空位，为了给自己的亲人们争得安放尸体的位置，活着的人们举着火把相互厮打，他们宁愿头破血流，也不愿将亲人的尸体抛入大海。他的面前呈现出一幅画面：酒红色、死气沉沉的海面上映着柴堆发出的熊熊火光，用来搏斗的火把在黑夜里火星四溅，恶臭的浓烟冉冉升向凝视着这一切的夜空。是的，这一切并没有超越可能的界限……","The doctor was still looking out of the window.Beyond it lay the tranquil radiance of a cool spring sky; inside the room a word was echoing still, the word “plague.”A word that conjured up in the doctor’s mind not only what science chose to put into it, but a whole series of fantastic possibilities utterly out of keeping with that gray and yellow town under his eyes, from which were rising the sounds of mild activity characteristic of the hour; a drone rather than a bustling, the noises of a happy town, in short, if it’s possible to be at once so dull and happy.A tranquillity so casual and thoughtless seemed almost effortlessly to give the lie to those old pictures of the plague: Athens, a charnel-house reeking to heaven and deserted even by the birds; Chinese towns cluttered up with victims silent in their agony; the convicts at Marseille piling rotting corpses into pits; the building of the Great Wall in Provence to fend off the furious plague-wind; the damp, putrefying pallets stuck to the mud floor at the Constantinople lazar-house, where the patients were hauled up from their beds with hooks; the carnival of masked doctors at the Black Death; men and women copulating in the cemeteries of Milan; cartloads of dead bodies rumbling through London’s ghoul-haunted darkness—nights and days filled always, everywhere, with the eternal cry of human pain.No, all those horrors were not near enough as yet even to ruffle the equanimity of that spring afternoon.The clang of an unseen streetcar came through the window, briskly refuting cruelty and pain.Only the sea, murmurous behind the dingy checkerboard of houses, told of the unrest, the precariousness, of all things in this world.And, gazing in the direction of the bay, Dr. Rieux called to mind the plague-fires of which Lucretius tells, which the Athenians kindled on the seashore.The dead were brought there after nightfall, but there was not room enough, and the living fought one another with torches for a space where to lay those who had been dear to them; for they had rather engage in bloody conflicts than abandon their dead to the waves.A picture rose before him of the red glow of the pyres mirrored on a wine-dark, slumbrous sea, battling torches whirl ing sparks across the darkness, and thick, fetid smoke rising toward the watchful sky.Yes, it was not beyond the bounds of possibility...."
"但是，理智渐渐驱走了这些荒诞的想象。的确，“鼠疫”这个词已被提出来了；的确，就在这个时刻，一两个病人正在经受这种疾病的煎熬。可是，鼠疫可能会停止蔓延，或者被遏制住。只需认清应该认清的事情，只需驱走外来的阴影，做些该做的事情。然后，鼠疫就会结束，因为它不是人们想象出来的，或者说，因为人们对它的想象是不正确的。如果鼠疫消失，这很有可能，那么一切都会好起来。如果不消失，人们也知道它是怎么回事，应该采取什么措施来制服它。","But these extravagant forebodings dwindled in the light of reason.True, the word “plague” had been uttered; true, at this very moment one or two victims were being seized and laid low by the disease.Still, that could stop, or be stopped.It was only a matter of lucidly recognizing what had to be recognized; of dispelling extraneous shadows and doing what needed to be done.Then the plague would come to an end, because it was unthinkable, or, rather, because one thought of it on misleading lines.If, as was most likely, it died out, all would be well.If not, one would know it anyhow for what it was and what steps should be taken for coping with and finally overcoming it."
"医生打开窗户，外面的声音一下子变得大了起来。从隔壁工厂传来锯木机发出的急促而又时断时续的咝咝声。里厄打起精神来。这才是可靠的，只有日常工作才是可靠的。其他一切都充满变数、靠不住；不能把时间耗费在这上面。应该做好自己该做的本职工作。","The doctor opened the window, and at once the noises of the town grew louder.The brief, intermittent sibilance of a machine-saw came from a near-by workshop.Rieux pulled himself together.There lay certitude; there, in the daily round.All the rest hung on mere threads and trivial contingencies; you couldn’t waste your time on it.The thing was to do your job as it should be done."
"第五章","Chapter 5"
"里厄医生正想到这里，有人告诉他约瑟夫·格朗来了。作为市政府办公室职员，格朗负责多项工作，有时被统计部门叫去统计出生、结婚、死亡等数据。因此，在过去的几天时间里，他又被叫去统计死亡人数，而且，因为他一贯热于助人，他主动提出把一份最新数据的手抄本给医生送过来。格朗由他的邻居科塔尔陪着，手里挥舞着一张纸。","The doctor’s musings had reached this point when the visit of Joseph Grand was announced.Grand’s duties as clerk in the Municipal Office were varied, and he was sometimes employed in the statistical department on compiling the figures of births, marriages, and deaths.Thus it had fallen to him to add up the number of deaths during the last few days, and, being of an obliging disposition, he had volunteered to bring a copy of the latest figures to the doctor.Grand, who was waving a sheet of paper, was accompanied by his neighbor, Cottard."
"“数字在上升，医生。48小时内死了11人。”","“The figures are going up, doctor.Eleven deaths in forty-eight hours.”"
"里厄和科塔尔握了握手，问他近来感觉如何。格朗解释说，科塔尔执意要前来向医生致谢并对他给医生所带来的麻烦致歉。但里厄只是皱着眉盯着纸上的数字。","Rieux shook hands with Cottard and asked him how he was feeling.Grand put in a word explaining that Cottard was bent on thanking the doctor and apologizing for the trouble he had given.But Rieux was gazing frowningly at the figures on the sheet of paper."
"“嗯，”他说，“或许该下决心说出这种疾病的名称了。直到现在我们还犹豫不决。看吧，我就要去实验室了，你们想一块儿去吗？”“当然，当然，”格朗说着，紧跟医生下了楼，“我也觉得是什么东西就该叫它什么。不过这是什么病呢？”","“Well,” he said, “perhaps we’d better make up our minds to call this disease by its name.So far we’ve been only shillyshallying.Look here, I’m off to the laboratory; like to come with me?”“Quite so, quite so,” Grand said as he went down the stairs at the doctor’s heels.“I, too, believe in calling things by their name.But what’s the name in this case?”"
"“这个我还不能说，反正你知道也没什么用。”","“That I shan’t say, and anyhow you wouldn’t gain, anything by knowing.”"
"“你看，”格朗微笑着说，“这并没那么容易！”","“You see,” Grand smiled.“It’s not so easy after all!”"
"他们出发向武器广场走去。科塔尔依然沉默不语。街道上的行人开始多了起来。此时，小城短暂的黄昏已经渐渐变成黑夜，星星开始在昼光未尽的天际眨巴着眼睛。不久后，街灯亮了起来，天色显得暗了下去，而街道上的说话声似乎也音调升高了。","They started off toward the Place d’Armes.Cottard still kept silent.The streets were beginning to fill up.The brief dusk of our town was already giving place to night, and the first stars glimmered above the still clearly marked horizon.A few moments later all the street-lamps went on, dimming the sky, and the voices in the street seemed to rise a tone."
"“对不起，”格朗在武器广场的角落里说，“但我现在得去赶车了。我晚上的时间是神圣不可侵犯的。正如我们家乡人所说：“今天的事情今天做——”","“Excuse me,” Grand said at the corner of the Place d’Armes, “but I must catch my car now.My evenings are sacred.As we say in my part of the world: ‘Never put off to tomorrow—’” "
"里厄已经注意到了格朗的癖好，他爱引用一些“他家乡”（他来自蒙特利马尔）的说法，然后再加几句诸如“迷失梦乡”或者“优美如画”的陈词滥调。","Rieux had already noticed Grand’s trick of professing to quote some turn of speech from “his part of the world” (he hailed from Montélimar), and following up with some such hackneyed expression as “lost in dreams,” or “pretty as a picture.”"
"“确实如此，”科塔尔说，“晚饭后可休想把他从家里拖出来。”","“That’s so,” Cottard put in.“You can never budge him from his den after dinner.”"
"里厄问格朗是否在为市政府做些额外的工作。格朗说不是这样，他是在做自己的事情。","Rieux asked Grand if he was doing extra work for the municipality.Grand said no, he was working on his own account."
"“是吗？”里厄随口问了一句，“那你的工作进展顺利吗？”","“Really?” Rieux said, to keep the conversation going.“And are you getting on well with it?”"
"“我在这件事上花了多年时间，没有进展才怪。尽管从某种意义上说进展不大。”","“Considering I’ve been at it for years, it would be surprising if I wasn’t.Though in one sense there hasn’t been much progress.”"
"“可以告诉我——”医生顿了顿说，“你在忙些什么吗？”","“May one know”—the doctor halted—”what it is that you’re engaged on?”"
"格朗抬起一只手把他两只大招风耳上的帽子往下拉了拉，喃喃自语了一番，里厄似乎只听到格朗的工作与“个性发展”有关。然后，格朗匆忙转身，一会儿就快步从无花果树下沿着马恩大街走了。","Grand put a hand up to his hat and tugged it down upon his big, protruding ears, then murmured some halfinaudible remark from which Rieux seemed to gather that Grand’s work was connected with “the growth of a personality.”Then he-turned rather hastily and a moment later was hurrying, with short, quick steps, under the fig trees lining the boulevard de la Marne."
"他们到达实验室门口时，科塔尔对医生说他很想去拜访他，向他请教些问题。正在口袋里掏着统计表的里厄回答科塔尔说，最好在他开诊的时侯来找他，但后来又改变了主意，说他明天会去科塔尔所在的地区，顺便在傍晚时分去看他。","When they were at the laboratory gate, Cottard told the doctor that he would greatly like to see him and ask his advice about something.Rieux, who was fingering in his pocket the sheet of paper with the figures on it, said he’d better call during his consulting-hours; then, changing his mind, told him he would be in his part of the town next day and would drop in to see him at the end of the afternoon."
"离开科塔尔时，医生发现自己在想着格朗，想象着他在鼠疫爆发中的情景——并非像现在这次可能并不严重的鼠疫，而是像历史上的一次大鼠疫的爆发。“他这种人总能逃过一劫。”里厄记得在哪里读到过，说鼠疫会放过身体羸弱之人，而主要伤害身体强壮之人。想着想着，里厄觉得格朗有点儿像是一位“神秘人士”。","On leaving Cottard the doctor noticed that he was thinking of Grand, trying to picture him in the midst of an outbreak of plague—not an outbreak like the present one, which would probably not prove serious, but like one of the great visitations of the past.“He’s the kind of man who always escapes in such cases.”Rieux remembered having read somewhere that the plague spared weak constitutions and chose its victims chiefly among the robust.Still thinking of Grand, he decided that he was something of a “mystery man” in his small way."
"的确，乍看上去，格朗体现了一位政府小职员的外貌特征和典型的行为方式。他又高又瘦，穿的衣服晃晃荡荡，好像总是选择太过宽大的衣服，以为这样可以穿得长久一些。尽管他的下牙床还有着大部分牙齿，但是上面的牙齿都掉光了，因此，他笑起来时，露出上嘴唇——下嘴唇很少露出来——整张嘴就像嵌在脸上的小黑洞。他走路时就像个害羞的年轻修士，贴着墙根走，然后像老鼠一样悄悄溜进门，身上散发着一股淡淡的烟草和地下室的味道。总之，他有着小人物的所有特点。确实，要描绘他还要费些工夫，他只不过是趴在办公桌上，认真核对城里浴室的收费标准或是为初级秘书收集最新垃圾清理税率报告材料的人物。甚至在了解他的工作之前，人们都会觉得，他来到人世的唯一目的就是做一位每天收入62法郎30分的市政府临时辅助员工，干些不引人注目又必不可缺的工作。","True, at first sight, Grand manifested both the outward signs and typical manner of a humble employee in the local administration.Tall and thin, he seemed lost in the garments that he always chose a size too large, under the illusion that they would wear longer.Though he still had most of the teeth in his lower jaw, all the upper ones were gone, with the result that when he smiled, raising his upper lip—the lower scarcely moved—his mouth looked like a small black hole let into his face.Also he had the walk of a shy young priest, sidling along walls and slipping mouselike into doorways, and he exuded a faint odor of smoke and basement rooms; in short, he had all the attributes of insignificance.Indeed, it cost an effort to picture him otherwise than bent over a desk, studiously revising the tariff of the town baths or gathering for a junior secretary the materials of a report on the new garbage-collection tax.Even before you knew what his employment was, you had a feeling that he’d been brought into the world for the sole purpose of performing the discreet but needful duties of a temporary assistant municipal clerk on a salary of sixty-two francs, thirty centimes a day."
"事实上，他在每月填写的市政府办公室人员登记表“工作职位”一栏里就是这么填写的。二十二年前——在获得入学考试证书后，由于缺钱，他不能继续学业——他获得这个临时工作的时候，他有望，或如他自己所说，很快“转正”。所要做的只是证明自己有能力处理这个城市行政管理上的一些微妙的问题罢了。有人向他保证说，一旦他转正，他一定会晋升到一个能使他生活非常舒适的职位。当然，雄心壮志并非激励约瑟夫·格朗的动力，他苦笑着这样发誓。他所向往的人生前景是用诚实的工作换来稳定的物质生活，使他能把业余时间投入到他的兴趣爱好当中去。他之所以接受这个工作是出于光明正大的动机，也可以说是出于对理想的忠实不渝。","This was, in fact, the entry that he made each month in the staff register at the Municipal Office, in the column Post in Which Employed.When twenty-two years previously-after obtaining a matriculation certificate beyond which, for lack of money, he was unable to progress-he was given this temporary post, he had been led to expect, or so he said, speedy “confirmation” in it.It was only a matter of proving his ability to cope with the delicate problems raised by the administration of our city.Once confirmed, they had assured him, he couldn’t fail to be promoted to a grade that would enable him to live quite comfortably.Ambition, certainly, was not the spur that activated Joseph Grand; that he would swear to, wryly smiling.All he desired was the prospect of a life suitably insured on the material side by honest work, enabling him to devote his leisure to his hobbies.If he’d accepted the post offered him, it was from honorable motives and, if he might say so, loyalty to an ideal."
"但是，这种“临时”状态一直没有改变，生活开支大幅上涨，而格朗的工资尽管有几次一般性的增加，还是少得可怜。他向里厄抱怨过这些，但其他人却似乎不清楚他的状况。这就是格朗的古怪之处，或者说这多少显示了他的这种特点。他本可以向政府提出要求，即使这不是他应享的权利——对此他自己也不清楚——至少，他曾经得到过这样的承诺。但是，一方面，当初向他许诺过的部门领导已去世多年，另一方面，格朗也不再记得当初确切的承诺是什么。而且，归根结底——这是真正的问题所在——约瑟夫·格朗找不到合适的说辞。","But this “temporary” state of things had gone on and on, the cost of living rose by leaps and bounds, and Grand’s pay, in spite of some statutory rises, was still a mere pittance.He had confided this to Rieux, but nobody else seemed aware of his position.And here lies Grand’s originality, or anyhow an indication of it.He could certainly have brought to official notice, if not his rights—of which he wasn’t sure—at least the promises given him.But, for one thing, the departmental head who had made them had been dead for some time and, furthermore, Grand no longer remembered their exact terms.And lastly—this was the real trouble—Joseph Grand couldn’t find his words."
"这种特点，正如里厄注意到的，才是我们这位可爱同胞的真正个性。也正是这个原因使他总也写不出他内心想写的温和适度的抗议信，或是采取形势所需的必要行动。据他所说，他觉得很难说出他的“权利”——这个词令他迟疑——也很难提起“承诺”——这个词暗示他在主张他的权利，因而是在显示一种与他的卑微职位不相称的大胆放肆。另一方面，他拒绝使用诸如“关照”、“感激”，甚至“请求”等词语，因为他认为这些词有失他的个人尊严。由于不能找到合适的用词，他才一直做着这份不起眼的薪水很低的工作，直到现在有些上了年纪。此外——反正他对里厄医生是这样说的——经历了长时间的体验，他已经意识到他的收入总能维持生计；他所要做的只是量入为出罢了。我们市长，这个城里的工业巨头经常说的一种观点就是，他坚持认为归根结底（他强调最后这个用词，常常用在他的辩论中）人们没有理由相信有人会饿死，格朗对此非常认同。他仍在继续推敲他的用词。","This peculiarity, as Rieux had noticed, was really the key to the personality of our worthy fellow citizen.And this it was which always prevented him from writing the mildly protesting letter he had in mind, or taking the steps the situation called for.According to him, he felt a particular aversion from talking about his “rights”—the word was one that gave him pause—and likewise from mentioning a “promise”—which would have implied that he was claiming his due and thus bespoken an audacity incompatible with the humble post he filled.On the other hand, he refused to use expressions such as “your kindness,” “gratitude,” or even “solicit,” which, to his thinking, were incompatible with his personal dignity.Thus, owing to his inability to find the right words, he had gone on performing his obscure, ill-paid duties until a somewhat advanced age.Also—this, anyhow, was what he told Dr. Rieux—he had come, after long experience, to realize that he could always count on living within his means; all he had to do was to scale down his needs to his income.Thus he confirmed the wisdom of an opinion often voiced by our mayor, a business magnate of the town, when he insisted vehemently that in the last analysis (he emphasized this choice expression, which indeed clinched his argumerit) there was no reason to believe that anyone had ever died of hunger in the town.He went on looking for his words."
"从某种意义上说，他的生活堪称典范。他勇于坚持自己的信念，这种人在这座城里或其他地方都不多见。他吐露的关于他个人生活的只言片语体现了他的善良和爱的能力，这是现在这个时代难得的一种品质。他毫不脸红地承认，他深爱着他的姐姐和外甥们，他仅有的至亲，每两年他会去法国探亲一次。他承认，一想起在他幼年时去世的父母，他就常常感到伤心。他毫不隐瞒这个事实：他特别爱听他那个区里每天下午大约五点时开始响起的动听的教堂钟声。然而，为了表达这样简单的情感，每个字都费了他好些工夫。表达困难已经成为他生活中的麻烦。“唉，医生，”他感叹说，“我多么想要学会表达自己呀！”他每次遇到里厄，都要提起这个话题。","In a certain sense it might well be said that his was an exemplary life.He was one of those rare people, rare in our town as—elsewhere, who have the courage of their good feelings.What little he told of his personal life vouched for acts of kindness and a capacity for affection that no one in our times dares own to.Without a blush he confessed to dearly loving his nephews and sister, his only surviving near relation, whom he went to France to visit every other year.He admitted that the thought of his parents, whom he lost when he was very young, often gave him a pang.He did not conceal the fact that he had a special affection for a church bell in his part of the town which started pealing very melodiously at about five every afternoon.Yet to express such emotions, simple as they were, the least word cost him a terrible effort.And this difficulty in finding his words had come to be the bane of his life.“Oh, doctor,” he would exclaim, “how I’d like to learn to express myself!”He brought the subject up each time he met Rieux."
"那天晚上，医生看着格朗远去的背影，突然想到了格朗想要说出的话来；显然，格朗是在写一本书或类似的东西。很奇怪的是，当他朝实验室走去的时候，这种想法令他感到安心。他知道这样的想法有多荒谬，但他就是不能相信，这座城市有着像格朗这样连癖好都无可指责的默默无闻的小公务员，而一场大规模的瘟疫还会降临到这里。准确地说，他无法想象这些癖好会存在于一个鼠疫肆虐的社区里，因此，他认为鼠疫一定不会在这个城里的居民中蔓延开。","That evening, as he watched Grand’s receding form, it flashed on the doctor what it was that Grand was trying to convey; he was evidently writing a book or something of the sort.And quaintly enough, as he made his way to the laboratory, this thought reassured him.He realized how absurd it was, but he simply couldn’t believe that a pestilence on the great scale could befall a town where people like Grand were to be found, obscure functionaries cultivating harmless eccentricities.To be precise, he couldn’t picture such eccentricities existing in a plague-stricken community, and he concluded that the chances were all against the plague’s making any headway among our fellow citizens."
"第六章","Chapter 6"
"第二天，由于里厄坚持提出许多被认为是不明智的想法，终于说服当局在省府召开卫生委员会会议。","Next day, by dint of a persistence that many thought ill-advised, Rieux persuaded the authorities to convene a health committee at the Prefect’s office."
"“城里的百姓变得紧张起来，这是事实。”理查德医生说，“当然，各种谣言都在四处传播。省长对我说，‘你们愿意的话，可以迅速采取行动，但不要声张。’不过他个人相信这不过是虚惊一场。”","“People in town are getting nervous, that’s a fact,” Dr. Richard admitted.“And of course all sorts of wild rumors are going round.The Prefect said to me, ‘Take prompt action if you like, but don’t attract attention.’ He personally is convinced that it’s a false alarm.”"
"里厄开车带卡斯特尔前往省府。“你知道，”卡斯特尔在车上说，“我们整个地区都没有一克血清吗？”“我知道。我给药库打过电话。那里的主任似乎感到十分震惊。这东西得从巴黎运过来。”","Rieux gave Castel a lift to the Prefect’s office.“Do you know,” Castel said when they were in the car, “that we haven’t a gram of serum in the whole district?”“I know.I rang up the depot.The director seemed quite startled.It’ll have to be sent from Paris.”"
"“希望他们快点儿着手去做。”","“Let’s hope they’re quick about it.”"
"“昨天我发了封电报。”里厄回答说。","“I sent a wire yesterday,” Rieux said."
"省长非常和善地跟他们打了招呼，但看得出来他正在焦躁不安。","The Prefect greeted them amiably enough, but one could see his nerves were on edge."
"“会议开始吧，先生们，”他说，“要我介绍一下情况吗？”","“Let’s make a start, gentlemen,” he said.“Need I review the situation?”"
"理查德认为没有必要。他和他的同行们都了解这些情况。唯一的问题是该采取些什么措施。","Richard thought that wasn’t necessary.He and his colleagues were acquainted with the facts.The only question was what measures should be adopted."
"“问题是，”老卡斯特尔有些粗鲁地插话说，“要弄清楚这是不是鼠疫。”","“The question,” old Castel cut in almost rudely, “is to know whether it’s plague or not.”"
"两三个医生表示反对。其他医生似乎在犹豫。省长突然一惊，很快地朝门口瞥了一眼，想确定这骇人听闻的话语没有被过道上的人偷听了去。理查德说，他认为重要的是不要大惊小怪。现在可以确认的只是我们得应对一种伴有淋巴腺肿并发症的特殊高烧症而已。在医学中和在日常生活中一样，匆忙下结论是不明智的。正在安静地咀嚼着自己上唇那又脏又湿的黄色短须的老卡斯特尔，抬起他那苍白却明亮的双眼盯着里厄。然后，他友好地扫视了一下医学委员会的其他成员，然后说他很清楚这是鼠疫，而且，不用说他也知道，如果公开承认此事，当局就不得不要采取一些非常严厉的措施。当然，这也是他的同行不愿面对事实的原因，因此，如果能使他们安心，他非常愿意说这不是鼠疫。省长激动起来，他说，无论如何，这种争论的方式在他看来是不合理的。","Two or three of the doctors present protested.The others seemed to hesitate.The Prefect gave a start and hurriedly glanced toward the door to make sure it had prevented this outrageous remark from being overheard in the corridor Richard said that in his opinion the great thing was not to take an alarmist view.All that could be said at present was that we had to deal with a special type of fever, with inguinal complications; in medical science, as in daily life, it was unwise to jump to conclusions.Old Castel, who was placidly chewing his draggled yellow mustache, raised his pale, bright eyes and gazed at Rieux.Then, after sweeping the other members of the committee with a friendly glance, he said that he knew quite well that it was plague and, needless to say, he also knew that, were this to be officially admitted, the authorities would be compelled to take very drastic steps.This was, of course, the explanation of his colleagues’ reluctance to face the facts and, if it would ease their minds, he was quite prepared to say it wasn’t plague.The Prefect seemed ruffled and remarked that, in any case, this line of argument seemed to him unsound."
"“重要的，”卡斯特尔说，“不是争论是否合理，而是争论能令人思考。”里厄一直沉默不语，于是大家要他谈谈自己的看法。","“The important thing,” Castel replied, “isn’t the soundness or otherwise of the argument, but for it to make you think.”Rieux, who had said nothing so far, was asked for his opinion."
"“我们正在面对，”他说，“一种伴有呕吐和淋巴腺肿大的伤寒性高烧症。我切开这些淋巴腺肿块，并把脓液送去化验过，我们的化验员认为已确定有鼠疫杆菌。","“We are dealing,” he said, “with a fever of a typhoidal nature, accompanied by vomiting and buboes.I have incised these buboes and had the pus analyzed; our laboratory analyst believes he has identified the plague bacillus."
"不过我一定要补充的是，还存在一些与鼠疫杆菌常规描述极不相符的特殊变异。”理查德指出这正说明一切还需等等看。毕竟，等候那批已进行几天的化验的数据报告才是明智之举。","But I am bound to add that there are specific modifications that don’t quite tally with the classical description of the plague bacillus.”Richard pointed out that this justified a policy of wait-and-see; anyhow, it would be wise to await the statistical report on the series of analyses that had been going on for several days."
"“若一种细菌，”里厄说，“在短暂间歇后三天内就能使脾脏肿大三倍，使肠系膜神经节肿大到橘子般大小并具有糊状物质的时候，等等看的做法是绝对不明智的。疫源地在不断扩大。从这种疾病传播的速度来看，如果我们不能阻止它的蔓延，很可能不到两个月它就会夺去一半居民的生命。如果是那样的话，你们是否叫它鼠疫或是某种发热症已不重要了。重要的是要阻止它夺去全城一半人口的生命。”","“When a microbe,” Rieux said, “after a short intermission can quadruple in three days’ time the volume of the spleen, can swell the mesenteric ganglia to the size of an orange and give them the consistency of gruel, a policy of wait-and-see is, to say the least of it, unwise.The foci of infection are steadily extending.Judging by the rapidity with which the disease is spreading, it may well, unless we can stop it, kill off half the town before two months are out.That being so, it has small importance whether you call it plague or some rare kind of fever.The important thing is to prevent its killing off half the population of this town.”"
"理查德说把事情描绘得太严重是不对的，况且，这种疾病尚未证实有传染性。事实上，和他的病人住在同一屋檐下的病人亲属都安然无恙。","Richard said it was a mistake to paint too gloomy a picture, and, moreover, the disease hadn’t been proved to be contagious; indeed, relatives of his patients, living under the same roof, had escaped it."
"“但是也有其他人死了，”里厄提醒说，“而且，传染性显然也不是绝对的。否则死亡数字就会不断增加，死亡率也会急剧攀升。这不是把情况描绘得太糟糕的问题。这是有必要采取预防措施的问题。”","“But others have died,” Rieux observed.“And obviously contagion is never absolute; otherwise you’d have a constant mathematical progression and the death-rate would rocket up catastrophically.It’s not a question of painting too black a picture.It’s a question of taking precautions.”"
"然而，理查德在总结他所看到的状况时指出，如果疫病不自行停止蔓延，就有必要采取法律规定的严厉的预防措施。而要这样做的话，就有必要正式承认鼠疫已经爆发了。而这一点还不确定。因此任何草率行事都应予以反对。","Richard, however, summing up the situation as he saw it, pointed out that, if the epidemic did not cease spontaneously, it would be necessary to apply the rigorous prophylactic measures laid down in the Code.And, to do this, it would be necessary to admit officially that plague had broken out.But of this there was no absolute certainty; therefore any hasty action was to be deprecated."
"里厄坚持他的观点。“重要的不是法律规定的措施是否严厉，而是这些措施是否能有效防止一半人口丧生。剩下的就是行政方面的事情，大家都知道我们的宪法已赋予省长在紧急情况下颁布必要命令的权力。”","Rieux stuck to his guns.“The point isn’t whether the measures provided for in the Code are rigorous, but whether they are needful to prevent the death of half the population.All the rest is a matter of administrative action, and I needn’t remind you that our constitution has provided for such emergencies by empowering prefects to issue the necessary orders.”"
"“确实是这样，”省长说，“但我需要你们从专业的角度确认这是一场鼠疫。”","“Quite true,” the Prefect assented, “but I shall need your professional declaration that the epidemic is one of plague.”"
"“如果我们不确认这是鼠疫，”里厄说，“它仍有可能夺去一半人的生命。”","“If we don’t make that declaration,” Rieux said, “there’s a risk that half the population may be wiped out.”"
"理查德有点不耐烦地插嘴说：","Richard cut in with some impatience."
"“事实是我们这位同行确信这是鼠疫。他对综合病征的描述证实了这一点。”","“The truth is that our colleague is convinced it’s plague; his description of the syndrome proved it.”"
"里厄回答说他没有描述过“综合病征”，只是描述了他亲眼看到的情况。他所看到的是肿大的淋巴腺，伴有胡言乱语的高烧以及四十八小时内的死亡。理查德医生能否担保不采取严厉的预防措施，这场疫病也会消失呢？","Rieux replied that he had not described a “syndrome,” but merely what he’d seen with his own eyes.And what he’d seen was buboes, and high fever accompanied by delirium, ending fatally within forty-eight hours.Could Dr. Richard take the responsibility of declaring that the epidemic would die out without the imposition of rigorous prophylactic measures?"
"理查德犹豫了，然后盯着里厄。","Richard hesitated, then fixed his eyes on Rieux."
"“请你坦率地回答我。你确定这是鼠疫吗？”","“Please answer me quite frankly.Are you absolutely convinced it’s plague?”"
"“你这个问题提得不对。这不是我用词的问题，这是时间的问题。”","“You’re stating the problem wrongly.It’s not a question of the term I use; it’s a question of time.”"
"“你的意见，我认为，”省长说，“是这样：即使这不是鼠疫，也要立即实施法律规定的、在鼠疫发生时适用的预防措施，对吧？”","“Your view, I take it,” the Prefect put in, “is this.Even if it isn’t plague, the prophylactic measures enjoined by law for coping with a state of plague should be put into force immediately?”"
"“如果一定要我有个看法，这就是我的看法。”","“If you insist on my having a View,’ that conveys it accurately enough.”"
"医生们讨论了一会儿。最后理查德代表他们说：","The doctors confabulated.Richard was their spokesman: "
"“结论是这样的：我们应该承担起责任，把这场疫病当作鼠疫行动起来。”","“It comes to this.We are to take the responsibility of acting as though the epidemic were plague.”"
"这种说法获得一致赞同。","This way of putting it met with general approval."
"里厄说：“不管你怎么称它，这对我来说关系不大。我要说的是，我们不应该抱着不可能一半人口会丧生的想法来行事，因为到时真会如此。”","“It doesn’t matter to me,” Rieux said, “how you phrase it.My point is that we should not act as if there were no likelihood that half the population would be wiped out; for then it would be.”"
"在怒目而视和一片抗议声中，里厄离开了会场。几分钟后，当里厄开车沿着一条散发着煎鱼和尿臭味的后街行进时，一个痛苦喊叫的妇人向他伸出双手，胯间滴着血。","Followed by scowls and protestations, Rieux left the committee-room.Some minutes later, as he was driving down a back street redolent of fried fish and urine, a woman screaming in agony, her groin dripping blood, stretched out her arms toward him."
"第七章","Chapter 7"
"会议之后的第二天，高烧症又有了一些发展。此事甚至见诸报端，不过报道是谨慎的，只是简短地提了提而已。然而，又过了一天，里厄发现城里各处开始张贴了一些官方的小布告，尽管都是贴在不起眼的地方。从这些布告很难看出当局在正视现实。采取的这些措施一点儿也不严厉，看来是为了迎合不惊动大众的想法。布告开门见山地宣称奥兰已发现几例高烧症，但还不能确定这种高烧症是否有传染性。这些病例的症状尚未明显到令人不安，因此当局相信可以依靠市民的力量来沉着应对这一状况。尽管如此，为了谨慎起见——这一点大家都会理解，省长下令实施一些预防措施。如果能认真研究并正确实施这些措施，就可以防止瘟疫的任何威胁。省长完全相信他辖区内的每一位市民都会全力支持他的个人努力。","On the day after the committee meeting the fever notched another small advance.It even found its way into the papers, but discreetly; only a few brief references to it were made.On the following day, however, Rieux observed that small official notices had been just put up about the town, though in places where they would not attract much attention.It was hard to find in these notices any indication that the authorities were facing the situation squarely.The measures enjoined were far from draconian and one had the feeling that many concessions had been made to a desire not to alarm the public.The instructions began with a bald statement that a few cases of a malignant fever had been reported in Oran; it was not possible as yet to say if this fever was contagious.The symptoms were not so marked as to be really perturbing and the authorities felt sure they could rely on the townspeople to treat the situation with composure.None the less, guided by a spirit of prudence that all would appreciate, the Prefect was putting into force some precautionary measures.If these measures were carefully studied and properly applied, they would obviate any risk of an epidemic.This being so, the Prefect felt no doubt that everybody in his jurisdiction would wholeheartedly second his personal efforts."
"布告列举了当局已制定好的整体计划。计划包括在下水道喷射毒气来系统灭鼠，以及对供水进行严格检查等。建议市民保持严格的清洁卫生，还要求身上发现跳蚤的市民都要到市医务所去。此外，一家之主必须及时汇报医生诊断的任何高烧症，并同意将生病的家人送往医院的特殊病房进行隔离。布告解释说，这些病房有足够的设备给病人提供及时治疗并保证最大的康复希望。另有几条补充规定要求对病人的房间和病人乘坐的车辆必须进行消毒。此外，省长还建议与病人有过接触的人都去接受卫生检查，并且一定要严格遵守他的建议。","The notice outlined the general program that the authorities had drawn up.It included a systematic extermination of the rat population by injecting poison gas into the sewers, and a strict supervision of the watersupply.The townspeople were advised to practice extreme cleanliness, and any who found fleas on their persons were directed to call at the municipal dispensaries.Also heads of households were ordered promptly to report any fever case diagnosed by their doctors and to permit the isolation of sick members of their families in special wards at the hospital.These wards, it was explained, were equipped to provide patients with immediate treatment and ensure the maximum prospect of recovery.Some supplementary regulations enjoined compulsory disinfection of the sickroom and of the vehicle in which the patient traveled.For the rest, the Prefect confined himself to advising all who had been in contact with the patient to consult the sanitary inspector and strictly to follow his advice."
"里厄医生猛地一转身，离开了布告处，起身回到诊所。正在诊所等候他的格朗一见到医生就夸张地抬起了双臂。","Dr. Rieux swung round brusquely from the poster and started back to his surgery.Grand, who was awaiting him there, raised his arms dramatically when the doctor entered."
"“对，”里厄说，“我知道。数字还在上升。”","“Yes,” Rieux said, “I know.The figures are rising.”"
"前一天市里有十位病人死去。医生对格朗说他可能晚上去看他，因为他答应要去拜访科塔尔。","On the previous day ten deaths had been reported.The doctor told Grand that he might be seeing him in the evening, as he had promised to visit Cottard."
"“这是个好主意，”格朗说，“你这样做对他有好处。事实上，我发现他变了很多。”","“An excellent idea,” Grand said.“You’ll do him good.As a matter of fact, I find him greatly changed.”"
"“在什么方面？”","“In what way?”"
"“他变得友善起来。”","“He’s become amiable.”"
"“他以前不友善吗？”","“Wasn’t he amiable before?”"
"格朗看起来有点儿不知所措。他不能说科塔尔以前不友善，这种说法不正确。但科塔尔是个寡言少语、鬼鬼祟祟的人，格朗认为他身上有种野猪般的东西。他呆在自己的卧室里，在一个廉价的餐馆里吃饭，行踪十分诡秘——这些就是科塔尔全部的生活。他自己说他是个酒类推销商。时不时有两三个人来拜访他，大概是他的顾客。晚上，他有时到他家对面的电影院去看电影。格朗提到与此相关的一个细节——科塔尔似乎爱看警匪片。不过格朗印象最深刻的是科塔尔的冷漠，抑或是对他人的不信任。","Grand seemed at a loss.He couldn’t say that Cottard used to be unamiable; the term wouldn’t have been correct.But Cottard was a silent, secretive man, with something about him that made Grand think of a wild boar.His bedroom, meals at a cheap restaurant, some rather mysterious comings and goings—these were the sum of Cottard’s days.He described himself as a traveling salesman in wines and spirits.Now and then he was visited by two or three men, presumably customers.Sometimes in the evening he would go to a movie across the way.In this connection Grand mentioned a detail he had noticed-that Cottard seemed to have a preference for gangster films.But the thing that had struck him most about the man was his aloofness, not to say his mistrust of everyone he met."
"而现在，据格朗所说，这一切都彻底改变了。","And now, so Grand said, there had been a complete change."
"“我不知到底该怎么说，反正我感觉他在尽力与所有的人友好相处，争取被大家喜爱。他现在经常和我说话，邀我一块儿出去，我都不好拒绝他了。毕竟，他关心我，而我也确实救过他的命。”自从科塔尔企图自杀以来，没有人来看过他。在街上，在店里，他总是尽力结交朋友。对杂货商他总是谦虚有礼，没人能像他那样有兴趣去和烟商闲聊。","“I don’t quite know how to put it, but I must say I’ve an impression that he is trying to make himself agreeable to all and sundry, to be in everybody’s good books.Nowadays he often talks to me, he suggests we should go out together, and I can’t bring myself to refuse.What’s more, he interests me, and of course I saved his life.”Since his attempt at suicide Cottard had had no more visitors.In the streets, in shops, he was always trying to strike up friendships.To the grocer he was all affability; no one could take more pains than he to show his interest in the tobacconist’s gossip."
"“这个烟商——一个女的，”格朗解释说，“是个可怕的人。我告诉过科塔尔，他却回答说我有偏见，其实她有很多优点，只是人们很难发现罢了。”","“This particular tobacconist—a woman, by the way,” Grand explained, “is a holy terror.I told Cottard so, but he replied that I was prejudiced and she had plenty of good points, only one had to find them out.”"
"也有那么两三次，科塔尔邀请格朗和他一块儿去城里的高级饭店和咖啡馆，最近他开始涉足这些场所。","On two or three occasions Cottard had invited Grand to come with him to the luxury restaurants and cafes of the town, which he had recently taken to patronizing."
"“那些地方气氛不错，”他解释说，“而且周围的人也不错。”","“There’s a pleasant atmosphere in them,” he explained, “and then one’s in good company.”"
"格朗注意到那些地方的服务人员对科塔尔招待得很周到，当他看到科塔尔慷慨给予他们小费时，他明白了个中道理。这个旅行推销商似乎对以慷慨换来别人对自己的友善感到十分满意。有一天，当领班送科塔尔到门口并且帮他穿上大衣时，他对格朗说：","Grand noticed that the staff made much of Cottard and he soon discovered why, when he saw the lavish tips his companion gave.The traveling salesman seemed greatly to appreciate the amiability shown him in return for his largesse.One day when the head waiter had escorted him to the door and helped him into his overcoat, Cottard said to Grand: "
"“他是个好人，他可以作个很好的证明。”","“He’s a nice fellow, and he’d make a good witness.”"
"“证人？什么意思。”","“A witness?I don’t follow.”"
"科塔尔犹豫了一会儿，然后作了回答。","Cottard hesitated before answering."
"“嗯，他可以证明我确实不是一个坏人。”","“Well, he could say I’m not really a bad kind of man.”"
"但是他的心情时好时坏。一天，杂货店老板对他稍有些怠慢，他就怒气冲冲地回了家。","But his humor had its ups and downs.One day when the grocer had shown less affability, he came home in a tearing rage."
"“他和其他人一样，这个贱人！”","“He’s siding with the others, the swine!”"
"“其他人是什么人？”","“With what others?”"
"“所有该死的那些人。”","“The whole damned lot of them.”"
"格朗还亲眼看到过发生在烟草商店里奇怪的一幕。大家正在热烈地谈论着，这时柜台后的女店员开始就一个轰动阿尔及尔的谋杀案夸夸其谈。一个年轻的商店员工在海滩上杀死了一个阿尔及利亚人。","Grand had personally witnessed an odd scene that took place at the tobacconist’s.An animated conversation was in progress and the woman behind the counter started airing her views about a murder case that had created some stir in Algiers.A young commercial employee had killed an Algerian on a beach."
"“我一直以为，”这个妇人开始说，“只有把所有的那些败类都关起来，才能让好人们松口气。”科塔尔一言不发地冲出店门，这让她对科塔尔的反应大为吃惊，不得不停下话来。格朗和女店员看着他跑开，目瞪口呆。","“I always say,” the woman began, “if they clapped all that scum in jail, decent folks could breathe more freely.”She was too much startled by Cottard’s reaction—he dashed out of the shop without a word of excuse—to continue.Grand and the woman gazed after him, dumbfounded."
"接下来，格朗又向医生汇报了科塔尔性情上的其他一些变化。科塔尔一贯公开承认自己具有自由主义思想。在经济问题上，他最喜欢的一句格言“大鱼吃小鱼”就是佐证。但现在他只买奥兰保守派思想的报纸，而且人们不禁要怀疑他是故意在公共场所阅读这些报纸的。类似的情况还有他在病愈起床不久后向格朗提出的请求。格朗说起他要去邮局，于是科塔尔请他帮忙给一位住在远方的姐姐汇去一百法郎，并说他每月都汇给她这么多。接着，格朗正要离开时，又被他叫了回来。","Subsequently Grand reported to the doctor other changes in Cottard’s character.Cottard had always professed very liberal ideas, as his pet dictum on economic questions, “Big fish eat little fish,” implied.But now the only Oran newspaper he bought was the conservative organ, and one could hardly help suspecting that he made a point of reading it in public places.Somewhat of the same order was a request he made to Grand shortly before he left his sick-bed; Grand mentioned he was going to the post office and Cottard asked him to be kind enough to dispatch a money order for a hundred francs to a sister living at a distance, mentioning that he sent her this sum every month.Then, just when Grand was leaving the room, he called him back."
"“不，给她汇二百法郎。这对她来说是个惊喜。她认为我从不关心她。而事实上我很爱她。”","“No, send her two hundred francs.That’ll be a nice surprise for her.She believes I never give her a thought.But actually I’m devoted to her.”"
"不久之后，他在和格朗的谈话过程中还说了一些奇怪的话。他闹着要格朗告诉他每晚干些什么“私事”。","Not long after this he made some curious remarks to Grand in the course of conversation.He had badgered Grand into telling him about the somewhat mysterious “private work” to which Grand gave his evenings."
"“我知道！”科塔尔大声说，“你在写书，不是吗？”","“I know!” Cottard exclaimed.“You’re writing a book, aren’t you?”"
"“可以这么说。但是没有写书那么简单。”","“Something of the kind.But it’s not so simple as that.”"
"“唉！”科塔尔叹了口气说，“我要是也有写作的技能就好了。”","“Ah!” Cottard sighed.“I only wish I had a knack for writing.”"
"格朗露出惊讶的表情，于是科塔尔有点儿不好意思地解释说，做个文人可以使事情在很多方面都好办一些。","When Grand showed his surprise, Cottard explained with some embarrassment that being a literary man must make things easier in lots of ways."
"“为什么呢？”格朗问。","“Why?” Grand asked."
"“为什么？因为一个作家要比普通人拥有更多权利，这大家都知道。大家都会让他三分。”","“Why, because an author has more rights than ordinary people, as everybody knows.People will stand much more from him.”"
"“看起来，”里厄在看布告的那个早晨对格朗说，“他和其他人一样，已经被老鼠事件搞得晕头转向。仅此而已。要不然，他可能是已经被‘高烧症’吓坏了。”","“It looks,” said Rieux to Grand on the morning when the official notices were posted, “as if this business of the rats had addled his brain, as it has done for so many other people.That’s all it is.Or perhaps he’s scared of the ‘fever.’” "
"“我怀疑不是这样，医生。如果你想知道我的看法，他——”","“I doubt it, doctor.If you want to know my opinion, he—” "
"他停了下来。外面响起一阵“灭鼠”车排气口发出的哗啦声。里厄沉默不语，直到对方能听清他的话时才漫不经心地问格朗有什么看法。","He paused; with a machine-gun rattle from its exhaust the “deratization” van was clattering by.Rieux kept silent until it was possible to make himself audible, then asked, without much interest, what Grand’s opinion was."
"“他是个良心上有些愧疚的人。”格朗严肃地说。","“He’s a man with something pretty serious on his conscience,” Grand said gravely."
"医生耸了耸肩膀。正像警官所说，他还有别的更要紧的事要做。","The doctor shrugged his shoulders.As the inspector had said, he’d other fish to fry."
"那天下午，里厄和卡斯特尔又谈了一次。血清仍未运来。","That afternoon Rieux had another talk with Castel.The serum had not yet come."
"“不过，”里厄说，“我怀疑血清是否管用。这种杆菌有点儿怪。”","“In any case,” Rieux said, “I wonder if it will be much use.This bacillus is such a queer one.”"
"“这一点，”卡斯特尔说，“我和你有不同看法。这些生物看起来总是有些独特。但是，归根究底，都是一样的东西。”","“There,” Castel said, “I don’t agree with you.These little brutes always have an air of originality.But, at bottom, it’s always the same thing.”"
"“这不过是你的推测。事实上，我们确实对此一无所知。”","“That’s your theory, anyhow.Actually, of course, we know next to nothing on the subject.”"
"“当然，这只是我的推测。然而，从某种意义上说，大家都这么认为。”","“I grant you, it’s only my theory.Still, in a sense, that goes for everybody.”"
"整整一天，医生感到他之前想起鼠疫就有些晕眩的感觉竟变得越来越强烈了。最后，他意识到自己是在害怕！他两次走进拥挤的咖啡馆。像科塔尔一样，他感到需要友善的交流和人们的热情。这是种可笑的本能，里厄心想。不过，这倒提醒了里厄，他曾答应要去拜访那位推销商。晚上，医生走进科塔尔房间时，科塔尔正坐在饭桌旁。桌上放着一本翻开的侦探小说。但是，天色已晚，在越来越浓的夜色中阅读一定很难。很有可能的是，科塔尔一直在昏暗中静坐沉思，直到他听到门铃声。里厄问他感觉如何。科塔尔坐了下来，有点儿暴躁地回答说他感觉还好，又说要是能保证没有人来打扰他，感觉还会更好些。里厄说人不能总是孤独地生活着。","Throughout the day the doctor was conscious that the slightly dazed feeling that came over him whenever he thought about the plague was growing more pronounced.Finally he realized that he was afraid!On two occasions he entered crowded cafes.Like Cottard he felt a need for friendly contacts, human warmth.A stupid instinct, Rieux told himself; still, it served to remind him that he’d promised to visit the traveling salesman.Cottard was standing beside the dining-table when the doctor entered his room that evening.A detective story lay open on the tablecloth.But the night was closing in and it would have been difficult to read in the growing darkness.Most likely Cottard had been sitting musing in the twilight until he heard the ring at his door.Rieux asked how he was feeling.Cottard sat down and replied rather grumpily that he was feeling tolerably well, adding that he’d feel still better if only he could be sure of being left in peace.Rieux remarked that one couldn’t always be alone."
"“我不是这个意思。我说的是那些存心想找你麻烦的人。”里厄没作声，于是科塔尔继续说：“请注意，我说的不是我自己。我一直在看这本侦探小说。这是有关一个倒霉的家伙的故事，他在一个美好的清晨突然被捕。人们一直都在留意他，而他却一无所知。大家在办公室里谈论他，把他的名字写入档案。你认为这样做公平吗？你认为他们有权那样对待他吗？”“嗯，”里厄说，“这不能一概而论。从某种意义上说，我认为任何人都没有这样的权利。但这一切都是次要的。重要的是你该出去走动一下。老呆在家里是不对的。”","“That’s not what I meant.I was thinking of people who take an interest in you only to make trouble for you.”When Rieux said nothing, he went on: “Mind you, that’s not my case.Only I’ve been reading that detective story.It’s about a poor devil who’s arrested one fine morning, all of a sudden.People had been taking an interest in him and he knew nothing about it.They were talking about him in offices, entering his name on card indexes.Now, do you think that’s fair?Do you think people have a right to treat a man like that?”“Well,” Rieux said, “that depends.In one sense I agree, nobody has the right.But all that’s beside the mark.What’s important is for you to go out a bit.It’s a mistake staying indoors too much.”"
"科塔尔好像恼怒了，说实际上他经常出去走动，如有必要，整条街上的人都可以为他作证。　此外，他还认识许多本城其他地区的人。","Cottard seemed vexed and said that on the contrary he was always going out, and, if need arose, all the people in the street could vouch for him.What’s more, he knew lots of people in other parts of the town."
"“你认识里戈先生，那个建筑师吗？他是我的朋友。”","“Do you know Monsieur Rigaud, the architect?He’s a friend of mine.”"
"屋子里几乎完全暗下来了。屋外，路灯全都亮起来了，街道上越来越热闹，传来阵阵轻松的低语声。里厄走到阳台上，科塔尔也跟了出来。从边远地区，微风送来喃喃细语和烤肉的香味，当吵吵嚷嚷的年轻人走出商店和办公室，涌到大街上，街上到处都是欢快而自由的嘈杂声，风中也夹杂着一种芬芳的气息，这座城每个夜晚都是如此。傍晚，看不见的轮船发出低沉的鸣笛声，海浪不断地咆哮着，人群中响起欢快的喧闹声——这是里厄往日认为独具魅力的黄昏时分——今天，这一切似乎由于他所了解的情况而魅力尽失。","The room was in almost complete darkness.Outside, the street was growing noisier and a sort of murmur of relief greeted the moment when all the street-lamps lit up, all together.Rieux went out on the balcony, and Cottard followed him.From the outlying districts—as happens every evening in our town—a gentle breeze wafted a murmur of voices, smells of roasting meat, a gay, perfumed tide of freedom sounding on its way, as the streets filled up with noisy young people released from shops and offices.Nightfall, with its deep, remote baying of unseen ships, the rumor rising from the sea, and the happy tumult of the crowd—that first hour of darkness which in the past had always had a special charm for Rieux—seemed today charged with menace, because of all he knew."
"“可以开灯了吧？”他们返回屋里时里厄说。","“How about turning on the lights?” he suggested when they went back into the room."
"灯亮了，这个矮个子男人看着里厄，眨巴着眼睛。","After this had been done, the little man gazed at him, blinking his eyes."
"“请告诉我，医生。假如我病了，你是否会送我到你医院的病房去？”","“Tell me, doctor.Suppose I fell ill, would you put me in your ward at the hospital?”"
"“为什么不呢？”","“Why not?”"
"科塔尔又问是否有人在医院或疗养院被捕过。里厄说他听说过这种事，但是一切都取决于病人的状况。","Cottard then inquired if it ever happened that a person in a hospital or a nursing home was arrested.Rieux said it had been known to happen, but all depended on the invalid’s condition."
"“你看，医生，”科塔尔说，“我很信任你。”接着，他问医生能否让他搭车到市里去。","“You know, doctor,” Cottard said, “I’ve confidence in you.”Then he asked the doctor if he’d be kind enough to give him a lift, as he was going into town."
"在市中心，街上的行人越来越少，亮着的灯也越来越少了。孩子们在门前玩耍。应科塔尔的要求，医生把车停在一群孩子身旁。他们正在玩跳房子游戏，大声地嚷嚷着。其中有一个梳着整齐光亮的小分头，但面部肮脏的男孩，他用一双明亮的眼睛大胆地盯着里厄。医生将目光移开。科塔尔站在人行道上摇了摇头。接着，他不安地向身后望了望，用沙哑又有些费力的嗓音说：","In the center of the town the streets were already growing less crowded and the lights fewer.Children were playing in front of the doorways.At Cottard’s request the doctor stopped his car beside one of the groups of children.They were playing hopscotch and making a great deal of noise.One of them, a boy with sleek, neatly parted hair and a grubby face, stared hard at Rieux with bright, bold eyes.The doctor looked away.Standing on the sidewalk Cottard shook his head.He then said in a hoarse, rather labored voice, casting uneasy glances over his shoulder:"
"“大家都在谈论瘟疫。是否真有此事，医生？”"," “Everybody’s talking about an epidemic.Is there anything in it, doctor?”"
"“人们总在谈论，”里厄回答说，“只是有这种可能罢了。”","“People always talk,” Rieux replied.“That’s only to be expected.”"
"“你说得对。一旦有十人死亡，他们就认为世界末日来了。而这不是我们现在所需要的。”车的发动机正在启动。里厄把手放在变速杆上。他又看了看那个男孩，他还在以一种严肃而专注的奇怪眼神注视着他。突然，这个孩子出人意料地朝他咧嘴一笑。","“You’re right.And if we have ten deaths they’ll think it’s the end of the world.But it’s not that we need here.”The engine was ticking over.Rieux had his hand on the clutch.But he was looking again at the boy who was still watching him with an oddly grave intentness.Suddenly, unexpectedly, the child smiled, showing all his teeth."
"“是吗？那么我们现在需要什么呢？”里厄一边问，一边朝孩子回以微笑。","“Yes? And what do we need here?” Rieux asked, returning the child’s smile."
"科塔尔正要转身离去，他突然抓住车门，用狂怒而动情的声音几乎是大喊道：","Abruptly Cottard gripped the door of the car and, as he turned to go, almost shouted in a rageful, passionate voice: "
"“一场地震！一场大地震！”","“An earthquake! A big one!”"
"地震没有发生，而第二天，里厄一整天都忙着开车到城里的各个角落，与病人家属或是病人本人交谈。里厄从未感到他的职业给他这么大的压力。在这以前，他的病人都很配合他的工作，他们都很信任他。现在，医生第一次感到病人的冷漠，他们带着一些令人困惑的敌对情绪，对他们的病情讳莫如深。这是一场他尚未适应的斗争。那天晚上十点，当里厄把车停在他那个老气喘病人的门前时——这是他那天看的最后一个病人——他费力地拖着身子从车座上站起来。他逗留了一会儿，望望昏暗的街头和夜空中忽隐忽现的星星。","There was no earthquake, and the whole of the following day was spent, so far as Rieux was concerned, in long drives to every corner of the town, in parleyings with the families of the sick and arguments with the invalids themselves.Never had Rieux known his profession to weigh on him so heavily.Hitherto his patients had helped to lighten his task; they gladly put themselves into his hands.For the first time the doctor felt they were keeping aloof, wrapping themselves up in their malady with a sort of bemused hostility.It was a struggle to which he wasn’t yet accustomed.And when, at ten that evening, he parked his car outside the home of his old asthma patient—his last visit of the day—it was an effort for Rieux to drag himself from his seat.For some moments he lingered, gazing up the dark street, watching the stars appear and disappear in the blackness of the sky."
"里厄进屋时，老气喘病人正坐在床上那个老位置上数着干豆，把它们从一个锅里放到另一个锅里。他抬头看见医生来了，高兴地微笑着。","When Rieux entered the room, the old man was sitting up in bed, at his usual occupation, counting out dried peas from one pan to another.On seeing his visitor he looked up, beaming with delight."
"“哦，是医生呀？是霍乱，不是吗？”","“Well, doctor?It’s cholera, isn’t it?”"
"“你究竟是从哪里听说的？”","“Where on earth did you get that idea from?”"
"“报纸上这样说，广播里也这样说。”","“It’s in the paper, and the radio said it, too.”"
"“不，不是霍乱。”","“No, it’s not cholera.”"
"“无论如何，”老人激动地笑着说，“那些头头们太过分了。神经过敏，不是吗？”","“Anyhow,” the old man chuckled excitedly, “the big bugs are laying it on thick.Got the jitters, haven’t they?”"
"“不要相信这些。”医生说。","“Don’t you believe a word of it,” the doctor said."
"他给老人看完了病，这时他坐在昏暗的饭厅中央。是的，尽管他对老人那样说，但他心里很害怕。他知道，明天一早，仅在郊区就有八到十个因为腹股沟淋巴腺肿而痛苦地蜷缩着身子的病人在等待着他。施行淋巴腺肿切开手术后，仅有两三例有所好转。大多数得送往医院，而他清楚医院对穷人来说意味着什么。“我不会让他们在他身上做实验。”一个病人的妻子这样说过。但他不会被当成试验品，他会死去，就是这样。现在采取的措施是不够的，这一点显而易见。至于“特殊装备”的病房，医生清楚它们是个什么样子：把其他病人仓促撤走后空出来的两栋楼房，窗户已被密封，四周已经设立了防疫警戒线。唯一的希望在于瘟疫会自生自灭。当局至今所想到的措施是不能阻止瘟疫的蔓延。然而，晚上的官方公报依然很乐观。第二天，朗斯多克情报信息局声称当地政府制定的措施已被普遍接受，并且已有三十位病人申报了病情。卡斯特尔给里厄打了个电话。","He had examined the old man and now was sitting in the middle of the dingy little dining-room.Yes, despite what he had said, he was afraid.He knew that in this suburb alone eight or ten unhappy people, cowering over their buboes, would be awaiting his visit next morning.In only two or three cases had incision of the buboes caused any improvement.For most of them it would mean going to the hospital, and he knew how poor people feel about hospitals.“I don’t want them trying their experiments on him,” had said the wife one of his patients.But he wouldn’t be experimented on; he would die, that was all.That the regulations now in force were inadequate was lamentably clear.As for the “specially equipped” wards, he knew what they amounted to: two outbuildings from which the other patients had been hastily evacuated, whose windows had been hermetically sealed, and round which a sanitary cordon had been set.The only hope was that the outbreak would die a natural death; it certainly wouldn’t be arrested by the measures the authorities had so far devised.Nevertheless, that night the official communique was still optimistic.On the following day Ransdoc announced that the rules laid down by the local administration had won general approval and already thirty sick persons had reported.Castel rang up Rieux."
"“特殊病房里有几张病床？”","“How many beds are there in the special wards?”"
"“八十张。”","“Eighty.”"
"“市里肯定不止三十个病人吧？”","“Surely there are far more than thirty cases in the town?”"
"“不要忘了，有这样两种情况：有些人胆小，有些人——这是大多数——还来不及申报。”","“Don’t forget there are two sorts of cases: those who take fright, and those-they’re the majority—who don’t have time to do so.”"
"“我知道了。掩埋有人监督吗？”","“I see.Are they checking up on the burials?”"
"“没有。我给理查德打了电话，告诉他需要采取有力措施，而不是讲空话。我们得建立防止疾病蔓延的真正屏障，否则不如什么也不做。”","“No. I told Richard over the phone that energetic measures were needed, not just words; we’d got to set up a real barrier against the disease, otherwise we might just as well do nothing.”"
"“是吗？那他怎么说？”","“Yes?And what did he say?”"
"“什么也做不了。他无能为力。依我看，情况会变得更糟。”","“Nothing doing.He hadn’t the powers.In my opinion, it’s going to get worse.”"
"事实就是这样。三天内，两栋楼房都住满了病人。理查德听说要清空一所学校作为辅助性的医院。里厄继续施行淋巴腺肿切开手术，并等着运来抗疫血清。卡斯特尔则重新翻查他以前的书籍，并长时间泡在图书馆里。","That was so.Within three days both wards were full.According to Richard, there was talk of requisitioning a school and opening an auxiliary hospital.Meanwhile Rieux continued incising buboes and waiting for the antiplague serum.Castel went back to his old books and spent long hours in the public library."
"“那些老鼠死于鼠疫，”卡斯特尔下结论说，“或死于近似鼠疫的疫病。而且这些老鼠在全城散播了成千上万只跳蚤，如不及时控制，这些跳蚤将以几何级数的增长速度传播疫病。”","“Those rats died of plague,” was his conclusion, “or of something extremely like it.And they’ve loosed on the town tens of thousands of fleas, which will spread the infection in geometrical progression unless it’s checked in time.”"
"里厄沉默无语。","Rieux said nothing."
"这段时间，天气好像开始晴朗起来，最近几次大雨后的积水也渐渐被太阳晒干了。每天早晨，蔚蓝的天空被金黄色的阳光所浸染，有时在刚刚出现的热浪中传来隆隆的飞机声——一切看起来都不错。然而在四天内，高烧症有了四次惊人的跃进：16人死亡，24人死亡，28人死亡，然后是30人死亡。到了第四天，官方宣布一所小学被改为辅助性医院开放。当地的居民们以前还故意用开玩笑的方式来掩饰内心的忧虑，现在则似乎都沉默不语，走路时也阴沉着脸。","About this time the weather appeared set fair, and the sun had drawn up the last puddles left by the recent rain.There was a serene blue sky flooded with golden light each morning, with sometimes a drone of planes in the rising heat—all seemed well with the world.And yet within four days the fever had made four startling strides: sixteen deaths, twenty-four, twenty-eight, and thirty-two.On the fourth day the opening of the auxiliary hospital in the premises of a primary school was officially announced.The local population, who so far had made a point of masking their anxiety by facetious comments, now seemed tongue-tied and went their ways with gloomy faces."
"里厄决定给省长打个电话。","Rieux decided to ring up the Prefect."
"“这些措施还远远不够。”","“The regulations don’t go anywhere near far enough.”"
"“是的，”省长回答说，“我已经看到了数字，正如你所说的，这些数字太令人不安了。”","“Yes,” the Prefect replied.“I’ve seen the statistics and, as you say, they’re most perturbing.”"
"“这些数字不只是令人不安，它们已经说明了问题。”","“They’re more than perturbing; they’re conclusive.”"
"“我会要求政府颁布命令的。”","“I’ll ask government for orders.”"
"里厄再次见到卡斯特尔时，还在为省长的话感到痛心。","When Rieux next met Castel, the Prefect’s remark was still rankling."
"“命令！”里厄轻蔑地说，“还需想象一番才行呢。”","“Orders!” he said scornfully.“When what’s needed is imagination.”"
"“血清有消息了吗？”","“Any news of the serum?”"
"“本周会运来。”","“It’ll come this week.”"
"省长通过理查德请里厄起草一份备忘录，向殖民地的中央政府要求颁布命令。里厄在备忘录里写下了医院的诊断及瘟疫的相关数字。当天又有40人死亡。省长如他自己所言，亲自负责加强新的管控。强制申报高烧症病例，隔离病人的措施也必须严格执行。病人的住房必须封闭并消毒，与病人共同居住的人必须接受检疫，埋葬事宜必须接受当地政府的监督——方式稍后再定。第二天，血清被空运过来。这些血清足够现在急需之用，但如果疫情继续扩展就不够用了。里厄收到回电说血清的应急储备已经用完，不过新的储备正在筹措之中。","The Prefect sent instructions to Rieux, through Richard, asking him to draw up a minute to be transmitted for orders to the central administration of the colony.Rieux included in it a clinical diagnosis and statistics of the epidemic.On that day forty deaths were reported.The Prefect took the responsibility, as he put it, of tightening up the new regulations.Compulsory declaration of all cases of fever and their isolation were to be strictly enforced.The residences of sick people were to be shut up and disinfected; persons living in the same house were to go into quarantine; burials were to be supervised by the local authorities—in a manner which will be described later on.Next day the serum arrived by plane.There was enough for immediate requirements, but not enough if the epidemic were to spread.In reply to his telegram Rieux was informed that the emergency reserve stock was exhausted, but that a new supply was in preparation."
"这时候，春天从远郊渐渐地走进市区。市场里，街道旁，成千上万朵玫瑰花在卖花人的篮子里凋谢，空气中弥漫着浓郁的玫瑰花香。表面上，这个春天确实与往常一样。公交车在高峰时间总是挤满了人，其他时间则乘客稀少，车上脏乱不堪。塔鲁依然观察着那个矮老头，而矮老头仍旧朝那些猫吐着唾沫。格朗每晚都赶回家去干他那神秘的文字创作。科塔尔还在到处乱转，而奥顿先生，那个地方治安官，继续在他的街区巡视。那位西班牙老人仍旧把干豆从一个锅搬弄到另一个锅，有时你还会遇到朗贝尔，那位新闻记者，他照旧对他所见到的事情倍感兴趣。晚上，街上依然人头攒动，电影院门前排着长队。而且，瘟疫似乎缓和下来，几天里只死了10人左右。接下来，数字又突然重新直线上升。在死亡人数重新达到30人的那天，里厄医生读着省长刚刚交给他的官方发来的电报，说道：“他们终于感到害怕了。”电报上写着：“正式宣布发生鼠疫。封闭全城。”","Meanwhile, from all the outlying districts, spring was making its progress into the town.Thousands of roses wilted in the flower-venders’ baskets in the market-places and along the streets, and the air was heavy with their cloying perfume.Outwardly, indeed, this spring was like any other.The streetcars were always packed at the rush hours, empty and untidy during the rest of the day.Tarrou watched the little old man, and the little old man spat on the cats.Grand hurried home every evening to his mysterious literary activities.Cottard went his usual desultory ways, and M. Othon, the magistrate, continued to parade his menagerie.The old Spaniard decanted his dried peas from pan to pan, and sometimes you encountered Rambert, the journalist, looking interested as ever in all he saw.In the evening the usual crowd thronged the streets and the lines lengthened outside the picture-houses.Moreover, the epidemic seemed to be on the wane; on some days only ten or so deaths were notified.Then, all of a sudden, the figure shot up again, vertically.On the day when the death-roll touched thirty, Dr. Rieux read an official telegram that the Prefect had just handed him, remarking: “So they’ve got alarmed at last.”The telegram ran: Proclaim a state of plague stop close the town."
"第二部    ","PART II "
"第八章","Chapter 8"
"从这时起，可以说我们所有市民都关注起这场鼠疫来。在此之前，尽管身边发生的这些奇怪的事情令人惊讶，但城里的每一位市民都尽可能照常做着自己的事情。而且，毫无疑问，人们本可以继续这样生活下去。然而，一旦城门关闭，人们就意识到,包括笔者在内的所有人都可以说是同舟共济，而每个人也只得适应新的生活状况。因此，一种诸如与心上人分离的痛苦这样普通的个人情感突然变为全城居民共有的情感，而且这种情感——夹杂着恐惧——是人们要面对的长期放逐的巨大痛苦。","From now on, it can be said that plague was the concern of all of us.Hitherto, surprised as he may have been by the strange things happening around him, each individual citizen had gone about his business as usual, so far as this was possible.And no doubt he would have continued doing so.But once the town gates were shut, every one of us realized that all, the narrator included, were, so to speak, in the same boat, and each would have to adapt himself to the new conditions of life.Thus, for example, a feeling normally as individual as the ache of separation from those one loves suddenly be came a feeling in which all shared alike and—together with fear—the greatest affliction of the long period of exile that lay ahead."
"事实上，封城的最突出的后果之一就是毫无准备的人们所面对的这种突如其来的分离。有些母子、情侣和夫妻前几天还想当然地认为这会是一次短暂的离别，他们说完几句无足轻重的话就在月台上吻别了，因为他们被人类对不久的将来的盲目自信所蒙蔽，以为几天后，最多几周后肯定又会再见面，短暂的离开对他们的日常事务几乎没有任何影响——但所有的这些人最终发现自己在毫无征兆的情况下被无情地分开，彼此不能再相见，甚至不能彼此通信。因为实际上，在官方命令发布之前几小时，封城就已经开始，自然无法考虑个人的困境问题。疫病无情袭击的第一个影响可以说真的就是迫使市民们像没有个人情感一样地行事。在禁止离城的命令实施那天的上午，省府周围围满了人。他们提出的请求具有同样的说服力，但同样都不可能予以考虑。是的，我们需要几天时间才能意识到我们完全被逼入了困境；“通融”、“帮忙”、“优先”等词都已失去了意义。","One of the most striking consequences of the closing of the gates was, in fact, this sudden deprivation befalling people who were completely unprepared for it.Mothers and children, lovers, husbands and wives, who had a few days previously taken it for granted that their parting would be a short one, who had kissed one another good-by on the platform and exchanged a few trivial remarks, sure as they were of seeing one another again after a few days or, at most, a few weeks, duped by our blind human faith in the near future and little if at all diverted from their normal interests by this leave-taking—all these people found themselves, without the least warning, hopelessly cut off, prevented from seeing one another again, or even communicating with one another.For actually the closing of the gates took place some hours before the official order was made known to the public, and, naturally enough, it was impossible to take individual cases of hardship into account.It might indeed be said that the first effect of this brutal visitation was to compel our townspeople to act as if they had no feelings as individuals.During the first part of the day on which the prohibition to leave the town came into force the Prefect’s office was besieged by a crowd of applicants advancing pleas of equal cogency but equally impossible to take into consideration.Indeed, it needed several days for us to realize that we were completely cornered; that words like “special arrangements,” “favor,” and “priority” had lost all effective meaning."
"甚至连通信这样令人稍感安慰的事也不被允许。情况是这样：不仅本城与外界的正常交通联系被阻断，而且——根据又一次疫情报告——一切通信都被禁止，以免信件向外传带病菌。起初几天，有些幸运者尽力说服了守卫城门的哨兵，将信件传递了出去。但这只是宣布发生鼠疫的初始阶段，那时哨兵们认为屈从于仁爱之情是自然的事。后来，当这些哨兵意识到事态的严重性时，他们就断然拒绝承担这种不能预见可能后果的责任。最初还允许同别的城市电话联系，但这导致公用电话处拥挤不堪，电话线路忙不过来，以致禁止通话了几天，然后又限制只有在诸如死亡、结婚和出生等“紧急情况”下才可通话。因此，人们只好重新借助起电报来。","Even the small satisfaction of writing letters was denied us.It came to this: not only had the town ceased to be in touch with the rest of the world by normal means of communication, but also—according to a second notification—all correspondence was forbidden, to obviate the risk of letters’ carrying infection outside the town.In the early days a favored few managed to persuade the sentries at the gates to allow them to get messages through to the outside world.But that was only at the beginning of the epidemic, when the sentries found it natural to obey their feelings of humanity.Later on, when these same sentries had had the gravity of the situation drummed into them, they flatly refused to take responsibilities whose possible after-effects they could not foresee.At first, telephone calls to other towns were allowed, but this led to such crowding of the telephone booths and delays on the lines that for some days they also were prohibited, and thereafter limited to what were called “urgent cases,” such as deaths, marriages, and births.So we had to fall back on telegrams."
"以前以友谊、感情或者情爱联系着的人们发现自己只有在十来个字的电报里重温旧梦了。而由于实际上电报中所能使用的词汇很快被用尽，长时间的共同生活或热切的思念很快就浓缩为几句平凡的套语交流，如：“我好。永远想你。爱你。”","People linked together by friendship, affection, or physical love found themselves reduced to hunting for tokens of their past communion within the compass of a ten-word telegram.And since, in practice, the phrases one can use in a telegram are quickly exhausted, long lives passed side by side, or passionate yearnings, soon declined to the exchange of such trite formulas as: “Am well. Always thinking of you. Love.”"
"但是，我们中间还有少数几个仍坚持写信，并且花了很多时间想方设法与外界取得联系，而这些计划到头来总是一场空。即使在少数情况下计划成功了，我们也无法知晓，因为我们没有收到任何回音。一连几个星期，我们都只能一再重复地写着同样的信，重抄着同样的新闻片段，发出同样的个人呼吁。这样过了一段时间，原先发自肺腑的生动语言也失去了任何意义。之后，我们继续机械地抄着信件，试图通过这些毫无生气的词汇来表达对我们所经历的折磨的看法。而从长远来看，相对于这些毫无结果、反反复复的独白、这些与墙壁进行的枯燥对话来说，平凡无趣的电报套语也渐渐地显得更为可取了。","Some few of us, however, persisted in writing letters and gave much time to hatching plans for corresponding with the outside world; but almost always these plans came to nothing.Even on the rare occasions when they succeeded, we could not know this, since we received no answer.For weeks on end we were reduced to starting the same letter over and over again recopying the same scraps of news and the same personal appeals, with the result that after a certain time the living words, into which we had as it were transfused our hearts’ blood, were drained of any meaning.Thereafter we went on copying them mechanically, trying, through the dead phrases, to convey some notion of our ordeal.And in the long run, to these sterile, reiterated monologues, these futile colloquies with a blank wall, even the banal formulas of a telegram came to seem preferable."
"又过了几天——当人们清楚根本没人能出得了城时——人们开始请求是否可以让鼠疫发生前已经离城的人回来。当局经过几天考虑之后同意了这个请求。但是当局要求回来的人无论如何都不许再次离城。一旦回来，无论发生什么，他们都得呆在城里。一些家庭——实际上为数极少——没有认真考虑就急切地要那些离家的亲人们回来，全然不顾地拍电报要他们抓住这次返家的机会。但那些困于鼠疫的人们很快意识到这样做会让亲人们面临可怕的危险，因而宁愿忍受亲人不在身边的痛苦。在疫病最严重的时期，我们只看到一个自然情感战胜对死亡恐惧的事例。这个事例也许有些出人意料，它并非发生在一对无论忍受什么痛苦也要厮守在一起的年轻情侣身上。这两人是结婚多年的卡斯特尔医生和他的老伴。卡斯特尔太太在鼠疫发生前几天离家去了邻城。他们并不是恩爱老夫妻的典范；相反，笔者有理由说，很可能这对夫妇自己都不确定是否对他们的婚姻感到满意。但是这次无情而又持续的分离使他们意识到彼此无法分开生活，而一旦有了这种意识，鼠疫的危险也就算不上什么了。","Also, after some days—when it was clear that no one had the least hope of being able to leave our town—inquiries began to be made whether the return of people who had gone away before the outbreak would be permitted.After some days’ consideration of the matter the authorities replied affirmatively.They pointed out, however, that in no case would persons who returned be allowed to leave the town again; once here, they would have to stay, whatever happened.Some families—actually very few—refused to take the position seriously and in their eagerness to have the absent members of the family with them again, cast prudence to the winds and wired to them to take this opportunity of returning.But very soon those who were prisoners of the plague realized the terrible danger to which this would expose their relatives, and sadly resigned themselves to their absence.At the height of the epidemic we saw only one case in which natural emotions overcame the fear of death in a particularly painful form.It was not, as might be expected, the case of two young people, whose passion made them yearn for each other’s nearness at whatever cost of pain.The two were old Dr. Castel and his wife, and they had been married for very many years.Mme Castel had gone on a visit to a neighboring town some days before the epidemic started.They weren’t one of those exemplary married couples of the Darby-and-Joan pattern; on the contrary, the narrator has grounds for saying that, in all probability, neither partner felt quite sure the marriage was all that could have been desired.But this ruthless, protracted separation enabled them to realize that they could not live apart, and in the sudden glow of this discovery the risk of plague seemed insignificant."
"这是一个例外。对大多数人而言，分离显然必须持续到疫病消失为止。因此对于我们大家每个人来说，支配着自己生活的感情——我们自以为很熟悉的感情（奥兰人的感情是简单的，这在前文已提到过）——呈现出一种新的面貌。一直完全信任妻子的丈夫们惊讶地发现自己变得嫉妒多疑起来。情侣们也是如此。那些本来自诩风流如唐璜的男人们变成了忠贞的典范。那些以前对身旁的母亲看都不看一眼的儿子们开始怀着深切的悔恨想象着刻在记忆深处那些在外的亲人脸上的每一道皱纹。这种突然而彻底的分离以及对未来的全然不知令我们感到意外。对离别不久却已相隔甚远的亲人那种默默的思念令我们不知所措。实际上，我们的痛苦是双重的：首先是自身所受的痛苦，其次是想象的在外的亲人，儿子、母亲、妻子或情人所受的痛苦。","That was an exception.For most people it was obvious that the separation must last until the end of the epidemic.And for every one of us the ruling emotion of his life—which he had imagined he knew through and through (the people of Oran, as has been said, have simple passions)—took on a new aspect.Husbands who had had complete faith in their wives found, to their surprise, that they were jealous; and lovers had the same experience.Men who had pictured themselves as Don Juans became models of fidelity.Sons who had lived beside their mothers hardly giving them a glance fell to picturing with poignant regret each wrinkle in the absent face that memory cast upon the screen.This drastic, clean-cut deprivation and our complete ignorance of what the future held in store had taken us unawares; we were unable to react against the mute appeal of presences, still so near and already so far, which haunted us daylong.In fact, our suffering was twofold; our own to start with, and then the imagined suffering of the absent one, son, mother, wife, or mistress."
"在其他情形下，我们这些市民本可能会通过更多的活动、更多的交际来寻找排遣。但是这场鼠疫却使他们无事可做，只好在城里枯燥无味地转来转去，日复一日地沉浸在回忆带来的虚幻慰藉之中。因为他们漫无目的地行走时，总是走到那么几条相同的街道上，因为小城很小，而这些街道都是在以前快乐的日子里他们同现已不在身边的亲人们一起走过的。","Under other circumstances our townsfolk would probably have found an outlet in increased activity, a more sociable life.But the plague forced inactivity on them, limiting their movements to the same dull round inside the town, and throwing them, day after day, on the illusive solace of their memories.For in their aimless walks they kept on coming back to the same streets and usually, owing to the smallness of the town, these were streets in which, in happier days, they had walked with those who now were absent."
"这样，鼠疫给我们这个城市带来的第一个影响是流放的感觉。笔者确信，他在这里写下的是自己的感受，这也是许多朋友们承认的共同感受。　毫无疑问，这是一种流放之感——内心深处始终存在的空虚感，那些期望时光倒流或是时光飞逝的痴心妄想，还有那些焦心的记忆利箭。有时我们陶醉于幻想之中，设想自己在等候亲人回来时响起的门铃声或楼梯上熟悉的脚步声。但是，尽管我们可能故意在平时旅客乘晚班火车应该到家的时间呆在家中，或是试图暂时忘记火车不通的事实，这种自欺欺人显然不能持久。我们必须面对火车不通这个事实的时刻总是会到来的。这时，我们意识到这种分离注定要继续下去，我们只有接受未来的这段日子。总之，我们又回到囚房般的家中，陪伴我们的只有对过去的回忆，即使有人寄希望于未来，也很快就放弃了这种想法——尽可能快地——一旦他们感受到幻想给幻想之人带来痛苦。","Thus the first thing that plague brought to our town was exile.And the narrator is convinced that he can set down here, the feeling he personally had and to which many of his friends confessed.It was undoubtedly the feeling of exile—that sensation of a void within which never left us, that irrational longing to hark back to the past or else to speed up the march of time, and those keen shafts of memory that stung like fire.Sometimes we toyed with our imagination, composing ourselves to wait for a ring at the bell announcing somebody’s return, or for the sound of a familiar footstep on the stairs; but, though we might deliberately stay at home at the hour when a traveler coming by the evening train would normally have arrived, and though we might contrive to forget for the moment that no trains were running, that game of make-believe, for obvious reasons, could not last.Always a moment came when we had to face the fact that no trains were coming in.And then we realized that the separation was destined to continue, we had no choice but to come to terms with the days ahead.In short, we returned to our prison-house, we had nothing left us but the past, and even if some were tempted to live in the future, they had speedily to abandon the idea—anyhow, as soon as could be—once they felt the wounds that the imagination inflicts on those who yield themselves to it."
"值得一提的是，市民们很快就放弃了要是在以前很可能会形成的习惯——设法推算流放可能持续的时间——即使是在公共场所也是如此。原因是这样：最悲观的人推算出可能的流放时间，比如说，六个月，他们对这半年暗无天日的日子事先做好准备，并鼓足勇气接受现实，竭尽全力来勇敢地忍受这漫长岁月的考验——当他们做好了这一切，他们遇见的某个朋友、报纸上的某篇文章、某种模糊的臆测或是一闪而过的远见都会提示他们，没有理由不相信疫病会持续半年以上，它为什么不会持续一年，甚至超过一年呢？","It is noteworthy that our townspeople very quickly desisted, even in public, from a habit one might have expected them to form—that of trying to figure out the probable duration of their exile.The reason was this: when the most pessimistic had fixed it at, say, six months; when they had drunk in advance the dregs of bitterness of those six black months, and painfully screwed up their courage to the sticking-place, straining all their remaining energy to endure valiantly the long ordeal of all those weeks and days—when they had done this, some friend they met, an article in a newspaper, a vague suspicion, or a flash of foresight would suggest that, after all, there was no reason why the epidemic shouldn’t last more than six months; why not a year, or even more?"
"这时他们的勇气、意志和耐力突然垮了下来，以致他们感到自己永远无法脱身于沮丧的深渊。因此他们强迫自己不再去想可能的解禁日期，不再去展望未来，也可以说强迫自己只看眼下的日子。但是这种谨慎，这种不愿勇敢面对困境挑战的做法自然效果不佳。因为，当他们回避自认为不能忍受的精神崩溃的时候，他们也剥夺了自己忘却鼠疫、想象日后团圆的幻想时刻，这些幻想在鼠疫爆发后常常出现。这样，他们在希望与失望之间，在毫无目标的生活和毫无结果的回忆里浮沉，就像一群漂泊不定的幽灵，只有甘愿扎根于痛苦的境地才能获得人的肉体之身。","At such moments the collapse of their courage, willpower, and endurance was so abrupt that they felt they could never drag themselves out of the pit of despond into which they had fallen.Therefore they forced themselves never to think about the problematic day of escape, to cease looking to the future, and always to keep, so to speak, their eyes fixed on the ground at their feet.But, naturally enough, this prudence, this habit of feinting with their predicament and refusing to put up a fight, was ill rewarded.For, while averting that revulsion which they found so unbearable, they also deprived themselves of those redeeming moments, frequent enough when all is told, when by conjuring up pictures of a reunion to be, they could forget about the plague.Thus, in a middle course between these heights and depths, they drifted through life rather than lived, the prey of aimless days and sterile memories, like wandering shadows that could have acquired substance only by consenting to root themselves in the solid earth of their distress."
"因此，他们也开始体会到一切囚徒和流放者无可救药的悲伤，那就是生活在无用的回忆之中。他们不断怀念的过去甚至也带有一种悔恨的味道。因为，他们真想把与现在他们等候归来的亲人以前在一起时能做而未做的事情加进回忆中去；所有的活动都是如此，甚至在囚禁生活相对快乐的时候，他们也总是徒劳地幻想着自己和身在外地的亲人在一起。这样，他们的生活里总是有种缺憾。对过去感到憎恨，对现在感到心焦，对未来感到绝望，我们像极了那些受到人类法律制裁或仇恨报复而生活在铁窗之后的囚徒。因而，逃避这种难以忍受的空虚感的唯一方法是再次让火车在幻想中驰骋，让寂静中充满动听的门铃声；现实是门铃顽固地沉默着。","Thus, too, they came to know the incorrigible sorrow of all prisoners and exiles, which is to live in company with a memory that serves no purpose.Even the past, of which they thought incessantly, had a savor only of regret.For they would have wished to add to it all that they regretted having left undone, while they might yet have done it, with the man or woman whose return they now awaited; just as in all the activities, even the relatively happy ones, of their life as prisoners they kept vainly trying to include the absent one.And thus there was always something missing in their lives.Hostile to the past, impatient of the present, and cheated of the future, we were much like those whom men’s justice, or hatred, forces to live behind prison bars.Thus the only way of escaping from that intolerable leisure was to set the trains running again in one’s imagination and in filling the silence with the fancied tinkle of a doorbell, in practice obstinately mute."
"那么，如果说这是一种流放，对大多数人来说，这是一种困在自己家中的放逐。虽然笔者体验的只是一般的流放生活，却不能不提一提像记者朗贝尔这类人所经历的加倍的离别之苦，因为这些被鼠疫困住的游客们被迫呆在这里，既见不着亲人，又远离家乡。在所有的流放者中，他们的感受最深。虽然他们在时间上承受的痛苦与大家一样，但他们还承受着空间上的痛苦。他们饱受思乡之苦，时时用头撞击着将他们与远在天涯的家乡隔离开来的疫区房屋的高墙。无疑，这些人经常整天都在尘土飞扬的城内孤独地徘徊，默默地呼唤着只有他们才知道的故乡乐土的黄昏与清晨。飞翔的燕子、黄昏的露珠或是那些太阳撒在僻静街道上的奇光异彩等飞逝而过却令人心烦意乱的迹象给他们徒增沮丧。对于这个能使人们摆脱一切的外部世界，他们闭上双眼不去观望，尽力沉浸在过于逼真的幻想之中，想象着一个沐浴在奇异光芒之下的世界，那里有两三座山丘、喜爱的树木、女人的微笑，这为他们构造了一种独一无二的境界。","Still, if it was an exile, it was, for most of us, exile in one’s own home.And though the narrator experienced only the common form of exile, he cannot forget the case of those who, like Rambert the journalist and a good many others, had to endure an aggravated deprivation, since, being travelers caught by the plague and forced to stay where they were, they were cut off both from the person with whom they wanted to be and from their homes as well.In the general exile they were the most exiled; since while time gave rise for them, as for us all, to the suffering appropriate to it, there was also for them the space factor; they were obsessed by it and at every moment knocked their heads against the walls of this huge and alien lazar-house secluding them from their lost homes.These were the people, no doubt, whom one often saw wandering forlornly in the dusty town at all hours of the day, silently invoking nightfalls known to them alone and the daysprings of their happier land.And they fed their despondency with fleeting intimations, messages as disconcerting as a flight of swallows, a dewfall at sundown, or those queer glints the sun sometimes dapples on empty streets.As for that outside world, which can always offer an escape from everything, they shut their eyes to it, bent as they were on cherishing the all-too-real phantoms of their imagination and conjuring up with all their might pictures of a land where a special play of light, two or three hills, a favorite tree, a woman’s smile, composed for them a world that nothing could replace."
"最后，专门来谈谈分隔两地的情侣的情况，这是笔者最感兴趣，恐怕也是笔者最有资格谈论的——他们心里承受着各种情感的折磨，尤其是悔恨。因为目前的状况使他们能够用一种极度客观的态度来重新审视以前的情感。而且，在这些情况下，他们通常不难发现自己的缺点。他们首先认识到自己很难想起不在身边的爱人的清晰画面。他们开始意识到自己全然不知对方的生活方式，责怪自己以前对此不仅太不了解，还装腔作势地以为，对恋人来说，不在一起时老占用着对方的时间是一种冷淡，而不是快乐的源泉。一旦意识到这一点，他们就能追溯过去的爱情，并发现它的不足之处。平时我们大家都自觉或不自觉地知道任何爱情都可以变得更完美。而我们或多或少都甘愿让自己的爱情停留在一般水平。但回忆不愿意作出妥协。毫无疑问，这场降临全城的飞来横祸不仅是给我们带来了不应承受的苦难，令我们可能愤慨不已。它还使我们自己给自己制造痛苦，并且甘愿接受被挫败的现状。这就是疫病转移人们注意力、混淆是非的伎俩。","To come at last, and more specifically, to the case of parted lovers, who present the greatest interest and of whom the narrator is, perhaps, better qualified to speak—their minds were the prey of different emotions, notably remorse.For their present position enabled them to take stock of their feelings with a sort of feverish objectivity.And, in these conditions, it was rare for them not to detect their own shortcomings.What first brought these home to them was the trouble they experienced in summoning up any clear picture of what the absent one was doing.They came to deplore their ignorance of the way in which that person used to spend his or her days, and reproached themselves for having troubled too little about this in the past, and for having affected to think that, for a lover, the occupations of the loved one when they are not together could be a matter of indifference and not a source of joy.Once this had been brought home to them, they could retrace the course of their love and see where it had fallen short.In normal times all of us know, whether consciously or not, that there is no love which can’t be bettered; nevertheless, we reconcile ourselves more or less easily to the fact that ours has never risen above the average.But memory is less disposed to compromise.And, in a very definite way, this misfortune which had come from outside and befallen a whole town did more than inflict on us an unmerited distress with which we might well be indignant.It also incited us to create our own suffering and thus to accept frustration as a natural state.This was one of the tricks the pestilence had of diverting attention and confounding issues."
"这样，每个人都甘愿活在当下，孤独一人在广袤而冷漠的天空下过日子。这种被遗弃的感觉也许能及时让人的脾气变得好一些，但却开始让人陷入一种无用的境地。比如说，有些市民开始受制于某种奇怪的奴役，让他们任凭天气阴晴的摆布。看他们的样子，你会觉得好像他们是生平头一次变得所谓对天气如此敏感。一线阳光足以令他们喜形于色，而雨天则让他们的脸庞和心情都阴沉下来。几个星期以前，他们还没有受到天气这种荒谬的奴役，因为他们不需独自面对生活。在某种程度上，和他们一起生活的亲人在他们狭小的世界里占据着最显著的位置。但从现在起，一切都变了。他们似乎任由善变的老天爷摆布——或者说，他们承受着痛苦却又毫无理性地抱着希望。","Thus each of us had to be content to live only for the day, alone under the vast indifference of the sky.This sense of being abandoned, which might in time have given characters a finer temper, began, however, by sapping them to the point of futility.For instance, some of our fellow citizens became subject to a curious kind of servitude, which put them at the mercy of the sun and the rain.Looking at them, you had an impression that for the first time in their lives they were becoming, as some would say, weather-conscious.A burst of sunshine was enough to make them seem delighted with the world, while rainy days gave a dark cast to their faces and their mood.A few weeks before, they had been free of this absurd subservience to the weather, because they had not to face life alone; the person they were living with held, to some extent, the foreground of their little world.But from now on it was different; they seemed at the mercy of the sky’s caprices—in other words, suffered and hoped irrationally."
"而且，在这种极度孤单的情况下，没人可以指望邻居来帮忙。每个人只得独自承受苦难的重负。如果我们中间有人偶尔想释放压力，或吐露些心声，那么无论对方作何回答，结果通常会伤害了他自己。他会明白他和谈话者之间没有共同语言。他自己表达的是多日来内心所受的痛苦，他想描绘的是在激情与悔恨的煎熬中逐渐形成并凝固的形象，而对方根本不明白，以为他说的只是普通的情感，那种随处可见、人人皆有的伤感。不管得到的回答是善意的还是恶意的，总是事与愿违，因此人们不想再与彼此交流。但至少有些人是这样，他们难以忍受沉默，而既然他人不能推心置腹地与之交谈，他们只好人云亦云，通常聊聊一般的故事、奇闻轶事和每天的报纸。所以，在这样的情况下，即使是最真实的悲伤也只得用最普通的套语来表达。鼠疫的囚徒们只有用这些话语来取得看门人的同情或引起听众的兴趣。","Moreover, in this extremity of solitude none could count on any help from his neighbor; each had to bear the load of his troubles alone.If, by some chance, one of us tried to unburden himself or to say something about his feelings, the reply he got, whatever it might be, usually wounded him.And then it dawned on him that he and the man with him weren’t talking about the same thing.For while he himself spoke from the depths of long days of brooding upon his personal distress, and the image he had tried to impart had been slowly shaped and proved in the fires of passion and regret, this meant nothing to the man to whom he was speaking, who pictured a conventional emotion, a grief that is traded on the market-place, mass-produced.Whether friendly or hostile, the reply always missed fire, and the attempt to communicate had to be given up.This was true of those at least for whom silence was unbearable, and since the others could not find the truly expressive word, they resigned themselves to using the current coin of language, the commonplaces of plain narrative, of anecdote, and of their daily paper.So in these cases, too, even the sincerest grief had to make do with the set phrases of ordinary conversation.Only on these terms could the prisoners of the plague ensure the sympathy of their concierge and the interest of their hearers."
"但是——这一点最重要——不管这些流放者因为空虚感到多么痛苦，心里有多么沉重，可以说他们在鼠疫的初期还算感觉是幸运的。因为就是在全城市民开始感到恐慌的时候，他们一心也只想着期待重逢的亲人。爱情的自我主义使他们免受一般的痛苦，如果他们想起鼠疫，只会想到这可能会造成与亲人的永久分离。因此，在疫病发作最厉害的时候，他们依然保持一种漠不关心的态度，简直可以是一种泰然自若。绝望让他们不再感到恐慌，因此，塞翁失马，焉知非福。比如说，即使他们中间有人被这场疫病夺去了性命，他自己也没有时间意识到这一点。当他与记忆中的影子进行绵长而无声的交流时，突然被死神揪了出来，然后直接被抛入永久的沉寂之中。他根本没有时间多想任何事情。","Nevertheless—and this point is most important—however bitter their distress and however heavy their hearts, for all their emptiness, it can be truly said of these exiles that in the early period of the plague they could account themselves privileged.For at the precise moment when the residents of the town began to panic, their thoughts were wholly fixed on the person whom they longed to meet again.The egoism of love made them immune to the general distress and, if they thought of the plague, it was only in so far as it might threaten to make their separation eternal.Thus in the very heart of the epidemic they maintained a saving indifference, which one was tempted to take for composure.Their despair saved them from panic, thus their misfortune had a good side.For instance, if it happened that one of them was carried off by the disease, it was almost always without his having had time to realize it.Snatched suddenly from his long, silent communion with a wraith of memory, he was plunged straightway into the densest silence of all.He’d had no time for anything."
"第九章","Chapter 9"
"当市民们正在设法适应这种突如其来的隔离生活时，鼠疫已使城门口安放了守卫，使前来奥兰的船只改变了行程。封城以来，没有任何车辆进过城。从那天起，人们感觉汽车仿佛都在绕城而行。","While our townspeople were trying to come to terms with their sudden isolation, the plague was posting sentries at the gates and turning away ships bound for Oran.No vehicle had entered the town since the gates were closed.From that day onwards one had the impression that all cars were moving in circles."
"从林阴大道高处俯瞰，港口也呈现出一种奇怪的景象。一直以来使这里成为整个海岸线上主要港口的商业活动突然销声匿迹了。只有几艘等候检疫的船只还停泊在海湾里。但码头上闲置着的大吊车、侧倚着的翻斗车、无人理会的成堆的袋子和桶——这一切都证明贸易也因鼠疫而衰败了。","The harbor, too, presented a strange appearance to those who looked down on it from the top of the boulevards.The commercial activity that hitherto made it one of the chief ports on the coast had ceased abruptly.Only a few ships, detained in quarantine, were anchored in the bay.But the gaunt, idle cranes on the wharves, tip-carts lying on their sides, neglected heaps of sacks and barrels—all testified that commerce, too, had died of plague."
"尽管有着如此不同寻常的景象，我们市民显然还很难明白究竟发生了什么。","In spite of such unusual sights our townsfolk apparently found it hard to grasp what was happening to them."
"人们有着共同的感受，比如恐惧和分离之感，但仍旧把个人利益放在首位。还没有一个人真正认识到疫病的含义。","There were feelings all could share, such as fear and separation, but personal interests, too, continued to occupy the foreground of their thoughts.Nobody as yet had really acknowledged to himself what the disease connoted."
"大多数人主要感到的是生活常规遭到了扰乱，个人利益受到了影响。他们感到焦虑和生气——但这些并非人们面对鼠疫时该有的情绪。比如，他们的第一反应便是责怪当局。报刊所反映的群众的批评——难道现在采取的措施不能放宽些？——迅速遭到省府的反驳，这有些出人意料。迄今为止，报纸和朗斯多克情报信息局都没有收到过有关疫病的官方统计数字。如今省府每天都把数据提供给该局，并要求每周公布一次。","Most people were chiefly aware of what ruffled the normal tenor of their lives or affected their interests.They were worried and irritated—but these are not feelings with which to confront plague.Their first reaction, for instance, was to abuse the authorities.The Prefect’s riposte to criticisms echoed by the press—Could not the regulations be modified and made less stringent?—was somewhat unexpected.Hitherto neither the newspapers nor the Ransdoc Information Bureau had been given any official statistics relating to the epidemic.Now the Prefect supplied them daily to the bureau, with the request that they should be broadcast once a week."
"然而公众对此所作的反应也没有想象中的那么迅速。因此公布的鼠疫第三周已有302人死亡这样的消息并没有激发公众的猜想。首先，这302人可能并非都死于鼠疫。其次，这座城里没人知道通常情况下每周的平均死亡率。本城的人口大约为20万。大家不知道现在的死亡率是否真的有那么不正常。事实上，从来没人太愿意关心这类数据——尽管它的意义很明显。总之，公众缺乏比较的标准。只有随着时间的流逝，死亡率的稳步上升不容忽视时，公众才开始意识到真相。第五周的死亡人数为321人，而第六周为345人。这些数字至少说明了问题。但是，尽管它们令人担忧，却还没有耸人听闻到足以改变人们的看法，人们依然认为这只是一场令人不快但一定为时不长的意外。","In this, too, the reaction of the public was slower than might have been expected.Thus the bare statement that three hundred and two deaths had taken place in the third week of plague failed to strike their imagination.For one thing, all the three hundred and two deaths might not have been due to plague.Also, no one in the town had any idea of the average weekly death-rate in ordinary times.The population of the town was about two hundred thousand.There was no knowing if the present death-rate were really so abnormal.This is, in fact, the kind of statistics that nobody ever troubles much about—notwithstanding that its interest is obvious.The public lacked, in short, standards of comparison.It was only as time passed and the steady rise in the death-rate could not be ignored that public opinion became alive to the truth.For in the fifth week there were three hundred and twenty-one deaths, and three hundred and forty-five in the sixth.These figures, anyhow, spoke for themselves.Yet they were still not sensational enough to prevent our townsfolk, perturbed though they were, from persisting in the idea that what was happening was a sort of accident, disagreeable enough, but certainly of a temporary order."
"因而，人们依然像以往一样，在城里到处闲逛，或在咖啡馆的露台上闲坐。一般来说，他们还不乏勇气，谈笑风声多于唉声叹气，对显然只是暂时的不悦似乎还能欣然接受。总之，人们在尽力撑着场面。但是，接近月底的时候，大约是在后面将要谈到的祈祷周里，更严重的事态发展改变了城里的整个面貌。首先，省府采取措施来控制交通和食物供给。汽油实行配给，粮食买卖受到限制。规定用电量也要减少。只有日用品可通过陆运或空运运入奥兰。这样，交通车辆逐步减少，直至马路上几乎看不到私家车。奢侈品店一夜之间都停业了，另一些店则贴出“货物售罄”的布告，而成群的顾客在店门口排队等候。","So they went on strolling about the town as usual and sitting at the tables on cafe terraces.Generally speaking, they did not lack courage, bandied more jokes than lamentations, and made a show of accepting cheerfully unpleasantnesses that obviously could be only passing.In short, they kept up appearances.However, toward the end of the month, about the time of the Week of Prayer which will be described later on, there were more serious developments, altering the whole aspect of the town.To begin with, the Prefect took measures controlling the traffic and the food-supply.Gasoline was rationed and restrictions were placed on the sale of foodstuffs.Reductions were ordered in the use of electricity.Only necessaries were brought by road or air to Oran.Thus the traffic thinned out progressively until hardly any private cars were on the roads; luxury shops closed overnight, and others began to put up “Sold Out” notices, while crowds of buyers stood waiting at their doors."
"奥兰呈现出一片新奇的景象。行人更多了，即使不是在高峰时刻，也有很多人挤在大街上或是咖啡馆里，因为商店和许多办事处都关闭了，人们闲着无事可做。眼下他们还没有失业，他们只是在度假。因此，在天气晴朗的日子里，下午快三点钟的时侯，奥兰就像是一座正在举行公众庆祝活动的城市：关上店门，停止交通，以便给制造欢乐的民众留出活动的空间。","Oran assumed a novel appearance.You saw more pedestrians, and in the slack hours numbers of people, reduced to idleness because shops and a good many offices were closed, crowded the streets and cafes.For the present they were not unemployed; merely on holiday.So it was that on fine days, toward three in the afternoon, Oran brought to mind a city where public rejoicings are in progress, shops are shut, and traffic is stopped to give a merry-making populace the freedom of the streets."
"电影院自然会利用这种状况，轻而易举地大赚一笔。不过，它们遇到了一个难题——交换影片的问题，因为这个地区影片的轮流放映已经中断。","Naturally the picture-houses benefited by the situation and made money hand over fist.They had one difficulty, however—to provide a change of program, since the circulation of films in the region had been suspended."
"两周后，各电影院不得不相互交换影片，又过了更长一段时间后，电影院只好循环放着同样的片子。尽管如此，它们的收入并没有减少。","After a fortnight the various cinemas were obliged to exchange films and, after a further lapse of time, to show always the same program.In spite of this their takings did not fall off."
"在这个酒类贸易占据首位的城市里，酒类库存非常可观，因此咖啡馆同样也能满足顾客的需求。而且，说实话，酒喝得可真多。一家咖啡馆想到了一个绝妙的主意，贴出了这样的广告：“最能抵御感染之物莫过于一杯好酒”，这坚定了人们本来就很流行的那种酒精能有效防止传染病的看法。每天半夜快到两点，许多被逐出咖啡馆的醉汉们步履蹒跚地走在大街上，大声宣告着他们的乐观主义。","The cafes, thanks to the big stocks accumulated in a town where the wine-and-liquor trade holds pride of place, were equally able to cater for their patrons.And, to tell the truth, there was much heavy drinking.One of the cafes had the brilliant idea of putting up a slogan: “The best protection against infection is a bottle of good wine,” which confirmed an already prevalent opinion that alcohol is a safeguard against infectious disease.Every night, toward two a.m., quite a number of drunken men, ejected from the cafes, staggered down the streets, vociferating optimism."
"但所有的这些变化，从某种意义上说，是如此怪异，又出现得如此突然，以至于人们认为这些变化不可能会持久。因此，大家依然关注着自己的个人情绪。","Yet all these changes were, in one sense, so fantastic and had been made so precipitately that it wasn’t easy to regard them as likely to have any permanence.With the result that we went on focusing our attention on our personal feelings."
"封城两天之后，里厄医生走出医院时在街上遇见了科塔尔。这个矮个子满意地微笑着。里厄祝贺他气色不错。","When leaving the hospital two days after the gates were closed, Dr. Rieux met Cottard in the street.The little man was beaming with satisfaction.Rieux congratulated him on his appearance."
"“是的，”科塔尔说，“我身体很棒。我这辈子要数现在最健康了。不过，请告诉我，医生。这该死的鼠疫怎样了？看起来变得相当严重了，对吗？”医生点了点头，而科塔尔继续活力充沛地说：“现在它没有理由停止蔓延。从当前状况来看，这座城市将被这一切搅得乱七八糟。”他们俩一起走了一小段路。科塔尔说起他那个街区里的一个储备了大量罐头食品以图厚利的一个杂货商。当救护人员前来接他去医院时，他把几十个肉罐头藏在床底下。“他死在医院里。在鼠疫里，钱是没用的，这毫无疑问。”科塔尔有着一肚子这种有关鼠疫的真真假假的故事。其中有一个故事说的是一个带有鼠疫症状、发着高烧的男子冲到大街上，扑向他遇到的第一个女人，搂住她，大叫着他“得病了”。","“Yes,” Cottard said, “I’m feeling very fit.Never was fitter in my life.But tell me, doctor.This blasted plague, what about it?Getting to look mighty serious, isn’t it?”When the doctor nodded, he continued exuberantly: “And there’s no reason for it to stop now.This town’s going to be in an unholy mess, by the look of things.”They walked a little way together.Cottard told the story of a grocer in his street who had laid by masses of canned provisions with the idea of selling them later on at a big profit.When the ambulance men came to fetch him he had several dozen cans of meat under his bed.“He died in the hospital.There’s no money in plague, that’s sure.”Cottard was a mine of stories of this kind, true or false, about the epidemic.One of them was about a man with all the symptoms and running a high fever who dashed out into the street, flung himself on the first woman he met, and embraced her, yelling that he’d “got it.”"
"“真有他的！”科塔尔评论着。但他接下来所说的似乎与他愉悦的语气不相符。","“Good for him!” was Cottard’s comment.But his next remark seemed to belie his gleeful exclamation."
"“无论怎样，我们大家很快都会成为疯子，这是确定无疑的。”","“Anyhow, we’ll all be nuts before long, unless I’m much mistaken.”"
"就在同一天下午，格朗终于向里厄倾吐了他的秘密。看到桌上里厄太太的照片，格朗好奇地望着里厄。里厄告诉他，自己的妻子正在外地疗养。“从某种意义上说，”格朗说，“这是种幸运。”医生赞同地说这确实是种幸运，但是，他接着又说，重要的是他的妻子能够康复。","It was on the afternoon of the same day that Grand at last unburdened himself to Rieux.Noticing Mme Rieux’s photograph on the desk, he looked at the doctor inquiringly.Rieux told him that his wife was under treatment in a sanatorium some distance from the town.“In one way,” Grand said, “that’s lucky.”The doctor agreed that it was lucky in a sense; but, he added, the great thing was that his wife should recover."
"“是的，”格朗说，“我懂你的意思。”","“Yes,” Grand said, “I understand.”"
"接着，格朗变得非常健谈，这是里厄认识他以来的头一次。尽管他说话时还是咬文嚼字，但几乎总能找到适当的字眼。确实，好像他对当时所说的话早已思考了很长时间似的。","And then, for the first time since Rieux had made his acquaintance, he became quite voluble.Though he still had trouble over his words he succeeded nearly always in finding them; indeed, it was as if for years he’d been thinking over what he now said."
"他十几岁时就与附近的一个贫穷的年轻姑娘结了婚。事实上，他就是为了结婚才辍学，找了现在的这份工作。他和珍妮都从未到过他们那个区以外的地方。在他追求珍妮的日子里，他常常到珍妮家去看她，而她的家人往往取笑这位害羞的、沉默寡言的追求者。她父亲是一位铁路工人。下了班，他常常坐在窗边的角落里，一双大手平放在大腿上，沉思地注视着来往的行人。他的妻子总是忙着家务，珍妮帮着她。珍妮个子非常娇小，格朗每次看见她过马路时总是很紧张，因为驶过她身边的车辆就像是庞然大物。圣诞节前有一天，他们一起出去走走，走到一个装饰精美的橱窗前驻足欣赏起来。珍妮心醉神迷地看了好一会儿，转过身来面对着他。“哦，太美了！”他紧紧握住她的手腕。就这样，他们俩互定终身了。","When in his teens, he had married a very young girl, one of a poor family living near by.It was, in fact, in order to marry that he’d abandoned his studies and taken up his present job.Neither he nor Jeanne ever stirred from their part of the town.In his courting days he used to go to see her at her home, and the family were inclined to make fun of her bashful, silent admirer.Her father was a railroadman.When off duty, he spent most of the time seated in a corner beside the window gazing meditatively at the passers-by, his enormous hands splayed out on his thighs.His wife was always busy with domestic duties, in which Jeanne gave her a hand.Jeanne was so tiny that it always made Grand nervous to see her crossing a street, the vehicles bearing down on her looked so gigantic.Then one day shortly before Christmas they went out for a short walk together and stopped to admire a gaily decorated shopwindow.After gazing ecstatically at it for some moments, Jeanne turned to him.“Oh, isn’t it lovely!”He squeezed her wrist.It was thus that the marriage had come about."
"接下来的事，在格朗看来，就很一般了。就和其他许多普通的夫妇一样。结婚，再浓情蜜意一小段时间，工作。工作太忙，爱情也就淡忘了。由于格朗所在的办公室主任食言，珍妮也只得外出工作了。读者读到这里，需要些想象力才能理解格朗想要表达的意思。主要是因为劳累，他渐渐迷失了自我，越来越少说话，也让他的妻子失去了被爱的感觉。一个过度工作的丈夫，生活贫困，前途逐渐渺茫，夜晚在家时相对无言——怎么可能还有激情在这样的条件下生活下去？珍妮可能已经感到痛苦了。但她仍然忍受着。当然，也许有人可以长时间受苦而不自知。就这样一年年过去了。后来，有一天，她离开了他。她当然不是独自一人离开的。“我爱过你，但现在我感到太累了。我不因离开你而感到幸福，但人们不一定为了幸福才追求新的起点。”这就是她在信中所说的大意。格朗也感到痛苦。而且，他本来——像里厄提到的那样——也可以有一个新的起点。但他没有，他已经失去了信心。只是，他情不自禁地想着她。他本来想给她写封信来为自己辩解。","The rest of the story, to Grand’s thinking, was very simple.The common lot of married couples.You get married, you go on loving a bit longer, you work.And you work so hard that it makes you forget to love.As the head of the office where Grand was employed hadn’t kept his promise, Jeanne, too, had to work outside.At this point a little imagination was needed to grasp what Grand was trying to convey.Owing largely to fatigue, he gradually lost grip of himself, had less and less to say, and failed to keep alive the feeling in his wife that she was loved.An overworked husband, poverty, the gradual loss of hope in a better future, silent evenings at home—what chance had any passion of surviving such conditions?Probably Jeanne had suffered.And yet she’d stayed; of course one may often suffer a long time without knowing it.Thus years went by.Then, one day, she left him.Naturally she hadn’t gone alone.“I was very fond of you, but now I’m so tired.I’m not happy to go, but one needn’t be happy to make another start.”That, more or less, was what she’d said in her letter.Grand, too, had suffered.And he, too, might—as Rieux pointed out—have made a fresh start.But no, he had lost faith.Only, he couldn’t stop thinking about her.What he’d have liked to do was to write her a letter justifying himself."
"“但这并不容易，”他对里厄说，“对此我已想了许多年。在我们相爱时，我们不需要说什么就能相互理解。但是爱情不是恒久不变的。有段时间，我本应该找些话来留住她——但我没能做到。”格朗从口袋里掏出一块方格子抹布似的东西大声地擤了擤鼻涕。然后，他又擦了擦他的胡须。里厄无言地注视着他。“请原谅我，医生，”格朗马上接着又说，“但是——我该怎么说呢？——我觉得你值得信任。这就是我能向你谈起这些事情的原因。不过，你看，我太激动了。”","“But it’s not easy,” he told Rieux.“I’ve been thinking it over for years.While we loved each other we didn’t need words to make ourselves understood.But people don’t love forever.A time came when I should have found the words to keep her with me—only I couldn’t.”Grand produced from his pocket something that looked like a check duster and blew his nose noisily.Then he wiped his mustache.Rieux gazed at him in silence.“Forgive me, doctor,” Grand added hastily, “but—how shall I put it?—I feel you’re to be trusted.That’s why I can talk to you about these things.And then, you see, I get all worked up.”"
"显然，格朗根本就没有关心鼠疫。","Obviously Grand’s thoughts were leagues away from the plague."
"当晚，里厄给妻子发了份电报，告诉她封城了，要她继续照顾好自己，他惦念着她。","That evening Rieux sent a telegram to his wife telling her that the town was closed, that she must go on taking great care of herself, and that she was in his thoughts."
"有天晚上——封城后三周左右——当里厄从医院出来时，看到一位年轻人正在大街上等着他。","One evening when he was leaving the hospital—it was about three weeks after the closing of the gates—Rieux found a young man waiting for him in the street."
"“你记得我，对吧？”","“You remember me, don’t you?”"
"里厄觉得见过此人，但又不能确定这人到底是谁。","Rieux believed he did, but couldn’t quite place him."
"“我在事件发生前拜访过你，”年轻人说，“为了了解阿拉伯人居住区的生活情况。我叫雷蒙·朗贝尔。”“啊，是的，当然记得。现在你可大有文章可做了。”朗贝尔看起来不如他们初次见面时那样自信，他说他来并不是为了这件事。他想知道医生是否能帮他点儿忙。","“I called on you just before this trouble started,” the young man said, “for information about the livingconditions in the Arab quarter.My name is Raymond Rambert.”“Ah yes, of course.Well, you’ve now the makings of a good story for your paper.”Rambert, who gave the impression of being much less self-assured than he had seemed on the first occasion when they met, said it wasn’t that he’d come about.He wanted to know if the doctor would kindly give him some help."
"“我很抱歉，”他接着说，“但是我在这里确实没有熟人，而我们报社的地方代表完全是个废物。”","“I must apologize,” he continued, “but really I don’t know a soul here, and the local representative of my paper is a complete dud.”"
"里厄说他得到市中心的一家诊所去，提议两人一起走过去。他们顺着黑人居住区的狭小街道往前走。夜晚就要来临了，但是过去一到这个时刻就很吵闹的城市，现在却异常安静。唯一的声音便是回响在余辉未尽的天空中的几声军号声。不管怎样，军队还在作出正常值勤的样子。其间，当他们沿着两边是蓝色、淡紫色和淡黄色墙头的坡度极大的狭小街道往下走着的时候，朗贝尔不断地说着话，似乎情绪非常激动。","Rieux said he had to go to a dispensary in the center of the town and suggested they should walk there together.Their way lay through the narrow streets of the Negro district.Evening was coming on, but the town, once so noisy at this hour, was strangely still.The only sounds were some bugle-calls echoing through the air, still golden with the end of daylight; the army, anyhow, was making a show of carrying on as usual.Meanwhile, as they walked down the steep little streets flanked by blue, mauve, and saffronyellow walls, Rambert talked incessantly, as if his nerves were out of hand."
"他说他把妻子丢在了巴黎。她并非真是他的妻子，但就跟妻子一样。刚封城时他给她发过一份电报。那时他以为这种状况不会持久，只想设法寄封信给她。但邮局官员拒绝了这一请求，当地报社的同行们说他们对此无能为力，省府办公室一位职员则当面嘲笑他。他只好排了两个小时的队才得以获准发了一份电报：一切都好。不久再会。","He had left his wife in Paris, he said.Well, she wasn’t actually his wife, but it came to the same thing.The moment the town was put into quarantine he had sent her a wire.His impression then was that this state of things was quite temporary, and all he’d tried to do was to get a letter through to her.But the post-office officials had vetoed this, his colleagues of the local press said they could do nothing for him, and a clerk in the Prefect’s office had laughed in his face.It was only after waiting in line for a couple of hours that he had managed to get a telegram accepted: All goes well. Hope to see you soon."
"但他第二天早上醒来时，突然想到毕竟不能确切地知道事态会持续多久。于是他决定立即离开奥兰。由于他的职业便利，他得以运用一些影响力见到了省府办公室的一位高官。他解释说他来奥兰纯属偶然，他与这座城市没有任何联系，没有理由留在这里，因此，他当然有权离开这里，即使出城后要接受一段时间的检疫隔离。官员说他十分理解对方的处境，但不能作任何特例处理。不过，他会看看能否做些什么，尽管他很可能不能立即作出决定，因为当局非常关注目前局势。","But next morning, when he woke up, it had dawned on him that, after all, there was absolutely no knowing how long this business was going to last.So he’d decided to leave the town at once.Being able, thanks to his professional status, to pull some strings, he had secured an interview with a high official in the Prefect’s office.He had explained that his presence in Oran was purely accidental, he had no connection with the town and no reasons for staying in it; that being so, he surely was entitled to leave, even if, once outside the town, he had to undergo a spell of quarantine.The official told him he quite appreciated his position, but no exceptions could be made.He would, however, see if anything could be done, though he could hold out little hope of a quick decision, as the authorities were taking a very serious view of the situation."
"“但是，该死的，”朗贝尔大叫着说，“我不是这里的人呀！”","“But, confound it,” Rambert exclaimed, “I don’t belong here!”"
"“确实如此。但无论怎样，让我们还是希望这场疫病很快就会过去吧。”最后，他安慰朗贝尔说，作为一名记者，他可以在奥兰找到极好的报道题材。确实，如果仔细想想，无论事情有多糟糕，都有它好的一面。对此，朗贝尔只能愤怒地耸耸肩，走出了办公室。","“Quite so.Anyhow, let’s hope the epidemic will soon be over.”Finally, he had tried to console Rambert by pointing out that, as a journalist, he had an excellent subject to his hand in Oran; indeed, when one came to think of it, no event, however disagreeable in some ways, but had its bright side.Whereat Rambert had shrugged his shoulders petulantly and walked out."
"朗贝尔和医生走到了市中心。","They had come to the center of the town."
"“这真是该死的傻话，医生，不是吗？事实上，我不是为写报道而生的。而是很可能为了与一个女人一起生活而来到这个世界的。这非常合情合理，不是吗？”","“It’s so damn silly, doctor, isn’t it?The truth is I wasn’t brought into the world to write newspaper articles.But it’s quite likely I was brought into the world to live with a woman.That’s reasonable enough, isn’t it?”"
"里厄谨慎地回答说朗贝尔所说的可能有些道理。","Rieux replied cautiously that there might be something in what he said."
"中心大街已不如往常那样人群拥挤。少数几个行人正急着赶回远方的家。没有人面带笑容。里厄猜想这是朗斯多克情报信息局最新的通报所造成的。市民们在事后二十四小时就会恢复信心。但在公布当天，数字在人们的脑海里是挥之不去的。","The central boulevards were not so crowded as usual.The few people about were hurrying to distant homes.Not a smile was to be seen on any face.Rieux guessed that this was a result of the latest Ransdoc announcement.After twenty-four hours our townspepole would begin to hope again.But on the days when they were announced, the statistics were too fresh in everybody’s memory."
"“事实上，”朗贝尔突然说，“她和我一起生活的时间很短，但我们很合得来。”里厄没说什么，朗贝尔接着说：“我知道我打扰你了。对不起。我只想知道你能否为我出一张证明，证明我没有患上这种该死的疾病。我想，这也许可以使事情变得更好办些。”","“The truth,” Rambert remarked abruptly, “is that she and I have been together only a short time, and we suit each other perfectly.”When Rieux said nothing, he continued: “I can see I’m boring you.Sorry.All I wanted to know was whether you couldn’t possibly give me a certificate stating that I haven’t got this damned disease.It might make things easier, I think.”"
"里厄点点头。这时一个小男孩撞在他腿上摔倒了，他扶小男孩站起来。他们继续往前走，来到了武器广场。蒙着一层尘土的棕榈树和无花果树垂头丧气地耷拉着树枝，树丛中象征共和国的雕塑也蒙上了一层污垢和尘土。他们在雕塑旁停下了脚步。里厄把两只脚踩在石板上跺了跺，想除去脚上的一层白灰。朗贝尔则帽子歪歪地戴着，松松地系着领带的衬衫领口敞开着，胡须也没有好好剃过，脸上露出一种阴沉而倔强的表情，那是年轻人感到自己深受伤害的表情。","Rieux nodded.A small boy had just run against his legs and fallen; he set him on his feet again.Walking on, they came to the Place d’Armes.Gray with dust, the palms and fig trees drooped despondently around a statue of the Republic, which too was coated with grime and dust.They stopped beside the statue.Rieux stamped his feet on the flagstones to shake off the coat of white dust that had gathered on them.His hat pushed slightly back, his shirt-collar gaping under a loosely knotted tie, his cheeks ill-shaven, the journalist had the sulky, stubborn look of a young man who feels himself deeply injured."
"“我理解你，这点请不要怀疑，”里厄说，“但是你必须清楚，你的要求是站不住脚的。我不能为你出具证明，因为我不清楚你现在是否患有这种疾病，而且，即使我清楚，我又怎能证明你在离开我的诊所去往省府办公室这段时间不会受到传染？况且，即使我——”","“Please don’t doubt I understand you,” Rieux said, “but you must see your argument doesn’t hold water.I can’t give you that certificate because I don’t know whether you have the disease or not, and even if I did, how could I certify that between the moment of leaving my consulting-room and your arrival at the Prefect’s office you wouldn’t be infected?And even if I did—” "
"“即使你——？”","“And even if you did—?”"
"“即使我给你出了证明，那也没用。”","“Even if I gave you a certificate, it wouldn’t help.”"
"“为什么没用？”","“Why not?”"
"“因为城里像你这种情况的人成千上万，却不可能获准离城。”","“Because there are thousands of people placed as you are in this town, and there can’t be any question of allowing them to leave it.”"
"“假使他们没有染上鼠疫呢？”","“Even supposing they haven’t got plague?”"
"“这个理由并不充分。哦，我知道这很讨厌，但我们都身陷其中，也只得接受现实了。”","“That’s not a sufficient reason.Oh, I know it’s an absurd situation, but we’re all involved in it, and we’ve got to accept it as it is.”"
"“但我不是这里的人。”","“But I don’t belong here.”"
"“不幸的是，从现在起，你同大家一样，都是这里的人了。”","“Unfortunately, from now on you’ll belong here, like everybody else.”"
"朗贝尔提高了些嗓门。","Rambert raised his voice a little."
"“但是，真该死，医生，难道你不明白这种普通的人类情感问题吗？还是你不知道一对情投意合的人分隔两地的滋味？”","“But, damn it, doctor, can’t you see it’s a matter of common human feeling?Or don’t you realize what this sort of separation means to people who are fond of each other?”"
"里厄沉默了一会儿，然后说他对此非常理解。他衷心希望朗贝尔可以获准回到他妻子的身边，也希望身处两地的情侣们可以再次相聚。只是法令就是法令，鼠疫已经爆发了，他也只能该做什么就做什么。","Rieux was silent for a moment, then said he understood it perfectly.He wished nothing better than that Rambert should be allowed to return to his wife and that all who loved one another and were parted should come together again.Only the law was the law, plague had broken out, and he could only do what had to be done."
"“不，”朗贝尔痛苦地说，“你不能理解。你是在讲大道理，而不是感情。你生活在抽象的世界里。”","“No,” Rambert said bitterly, “you can’t understand.You’re using the language of reason, not of the heart; you live in a world of abstractions.”"
"医生抬头望着象征共和国的雕塑，然后说他不清楚他是否在讲大道理，但他知道他讲的是摆在大家面前的事实——这两者并不一定是一回事。","The doctor glanced up at the statue of the Republic, then said he did not know if he was using the language of reason, but he knew he was using the language of the facts as everybody could see them—which wasn’t necessarily the same thing."
"记者整了整领带。","The journalist tugged at his tie to straighten it."
"“那么，我知道了，我不能指望你帮忙了。很好。但是——”他用一种不服气的语气接着说，“我会离开这个城市的。”","“So, I take it, I can’t count on help from you.Very good.But”—his tone was challenging—“leave this town I shall.”"
"医生反复说他非常理解，但这一切都与他无关。","The doctor repeated that he quite understood, but all that was none of his business."
"“很抱歉，但这确实与你有关。”朗贝尔再次提高了嗓门，大声说，“我来找你就是因为有人告诉过我，你在起草这些已经颁布的法令中起了很大作用。当时我想，你这个帮助系铃的人至少可以解一次铃。但是你却无动于衷，你从不关心任何人，你没有为分居两地的人着想。”","“Excuse me, but it is your business.”Rambert raised his voice again.“I approached you because I’d been told you played a large part in drawing up the orders that have been issued.So I thought that in one case anyhow you could unmake what you’d helped to make.But you don’t care; you never gave a thought to anybody, you didn’t take the case of people who are separated into account.”"
"里厄承认，在某种意义上说，这是事实，他确实不愿考虑这些事情。","Rieux admitted this was true up to a point; he’d preferred not to take such cases into account."
"“啊，我明白了！”朗贝尔大叫着说，“你马上就要说些公众利益的话了。但公众利益也是以每个人的个人利益为基础的。”","“Ah, I see now!” Rambert exclaimed.“You’ll soon be talking about the interests of the general public.But public welfare is merely the sum total of the private welfares of each of us.”"
"里厄似乎突然如梦初醒。","The doctor seemed abruptly to come out of a dream."
"“哦，得了！”他说，“就是这样，但事情不仅仅是这样。匆忙下结论是没有用的。但你没有理由发火。我向你保证，假如你能想到一个让自己摆脱隔离的办法，我将万分高兴。只是，我的工作职责不允许我这样做。”","“Oh, come!” he said.“There’s that, but there’s much more to it than that.It doesn’t do to rush to conclusions, you know.But you’ve no reason to feel angered.I assure you that if you find a way out of your quandary, I shall be extremely pleased.Only, there are things that my official position debars me from doing.”"
"朗贝尔不耐烦地扬起头。","Rambert tossed his head petulantly."
"“是的，是的，我不该发火。而且我也占用了你太多的时间。”","“Yes, yes, I was wrong to show annoyance.And I’ve taken up too much of your time already.”"
"里厄要朗贝尔随时把事情的进展情况告诉他，而不要因为他没帮上忙而对他耿耿于怀。他又说，他相信他们还是有些共同话语的。朗贝尔看起来很困惑。","Rieux asked him to let him know how he got on with his project, and not to bear him a grudge for not having been more amenable.He was sure, he added, that there was some common ground on which they could meet.Rambert looked perplexed."
"“是的，”他沉默了一阵之后说，“我也是这么认为的——不管我说过什么，也不管你说过什么。”他顿了顿说，“不过，我还是不能赞同你的看法。”","Then, “Yes,” he said after a short silence, “I rather think so, too—in spite of myself, and of all you’ve just been saying.”He paused.“Still, I can’t agree with you.”"
"他把帽沿往下一拉，遮挡住双眼，然后快步走开了。里厄目送他走进塔鲁住的那家旅馆。","Pulling down his hat over his eyes, he walked quickly away.Rieux saw him enter the hotel where Tarrou was staying."
"过了一会儿，医生轻轻地点了点头，似乎对头脑里闪过的某种念头表示赞同。的确，记者不愿自己的幸福受到阻碍是正确的。但生活在这样一个抽象的世界里，他责备自己又是否正确呢？“抽象”这个词真的能用来描述鼠疫在城里蔓延、死亡人数升至每周五百人时他在自己的医院里度过的这些日子吗？是的，这样的灾祸中有抽象和不现实之处。但是，当抽象观念开始涉及生死问题时，你就得认真对待它了。而且里厄十分清楚：这不是最容易办到的事情。比如说，他负责的那所辅助性医院——现在已有三所这样的医院了——管理起来就不轻松。","After a moment the doctor gave a slight nod, as if approving of some thought that had crossed his mind.Yes, the journalist was right in refusing to be balked of happiness.But was he right in reproaching him, Rieux, with living in a world of abstractions?Could that term “abstraction” really apply to these days he spent in his hospital while the plague was battening on the town, raising its death-toll to five hundred victims a week?Yes, an element of abstraction, of a divorce from reality, entered into such calamities.Still when abstraction sets to killing you, you’ve got to get busy with it.And so much Rieux knew: that this wasn’t the easiest course.Running this auxiliary hospital, for instance, of which he was in charge—there were now three such hospitals—was no light task."
"他叫人把通往手术室的接待室装修了一下，以作接收病人之用。接待室的地面被挖成了一个浅浅的水池，水里加了甲苯基酸，池子中央有个砖砌的小平台。将病人抬到平台上，迅速地脱去衣服，然后将衣物丢进消毒水里。病人洗过身子，擦干后，穿上医院的粗布睡衣，被送到里厄那里检查，然后被送入病房。这个医院，一个被征用的学校，现在有五百张病床，几乎都住满了。里厄亲自监督患者的接收工作，然后给患者进行注射血清、切除腹股沟肿块，以及核查统计数值等工作，最后回去进行下午的门诊。到了晚上，他才出门去巡诊，直到深夜才回家。前一天晚上，他母亲把他媳妇的电报递给他的时候，他的双手直发抖。","He had had an anteroom, leading into his surgery, installed, equipped for dealing with patients on arrival.The floor had been excavated and replaced by a shallow lake of water and cresylic acid, in the center of which was a sort of island made of bricks.The patient was carried to the island, rapidly undressed, and his clothes dropped into the disinfectant water.After being washed, dried, and dressed in one of the coarse hospital nightshirts, he was taken to Rieux for examination, then carried to one of the wards.This hospital, a requisitioned schoolhouse, now contained five hundred beds, almost all of which were occupied.After the reception of the patients, which he personally supervised, Rieux injected serum, lanced buboes, checked the statistics again, and returned for his afternoon consultations.Only when night was setting in did he start on his round of visits, and he never got home till a very late hour.On the previous night his mother, when handing him a telegram from his wife, had remarked that his hands were shaking."
"“是在抖，”他说，“但是只要坚持下去，我就不会紧张了，你会看到的。”","“Yes,” he said.“But it’s only a matter of sticking to it, and my nerves will steady down, you’ll see.”"
"他体格健壮，因而至今还并非真的感到疲劳。只是，首先是他的出诊开始让他感到极大的压力。一旦诊断为瘟疫，病人就得马上被运走。于是又得开始讲“抽象”的大道理，与病人家属进行斗争，因为他们知道，要等到病人死了或是痊愈了才能再相见。“可怜可怜吧，医生！”正是洛雷特太太，塔鲁所住旅馆客房女佣的母亲，提出这样的请求。这种请求毫无用处，他当然可怜她。但这有什么用呢？他必须打电话，然后救护车的警笛音很快就会响彻大街。（起初邻居们还常常开窗看看。后来他们就会很快把窗户关上。）接下来又是一幕挣扎、啼哭、恳求的场面——总之，都是些抽象的东西。在那些被高烧搞得神经紧张的病人家里，出现了许多疯狂的场面。但结果总是一样。病人被带走了。然后，里厄也可以走了。开始几天，他只是打过电话之后就接着赶去看别的病人，并不等救护车来。但他刚一走，病人家就关上门，宁愿同鼠疫病人在一起也不愿分离，因为他们非常清楚事情的结果。接下来就是叱责、尖叫、用力敲门、警察干预，然后是出动军队，病人被强行带走。因此，头几周里，里厄只好陪着病人，直到救护车来了才走。后来，当每个医生都有一个志愿者警官陪同出诊时，里厄才能马上离开，赶往下一个患者家。但起初，每天晚上的情况都像他被请去看洛雷特太太的女儿那天晚上一样。他被领进装饰有扇子和假花的小房间里。病人的母亲带着勉强的笑容迎接他。","He had a robust constitution and, as yet, wasn’t really tired.Still his visits, for one thing, were beginning to put a great strain on his endurance.Once the epidemic was diagnosed, the patient had to be evacuated forthwith.Then indeed began “abstraction” and a tussle with the family, who knew they would not see the sick man again until he was dead or cured.“Have some pity, doctor!”It was Mme Loret, mother of the chambermaid at Tarrou’s hotel, who made the appeal.An unnecessary appeal; of course he had pity.But what purpose could it serve?He had to telephone, and soon the ambulance could be heard clanging down the street.(At first the neighbors used to open windows and watch.Later they promptly shut them.)Then came a second phase of conflict, tears and pleadings—abstraction, in a word.In those fever-hot, nerve-ridden sickrooms crazy scenes took place.But the issue was always the same.The patient was removed.Then Rieux, too, could leave.In the early days he had merely telephoned, then rushed off to see other patients, without waiting for the ambulance.But no sooner was he gone than the family locked and barred their doors, preferring contact with the plague to a parting whose issue they now knew only too well.There followed objurgations, screams, batterings on the door, action by the police, and later armed force; the patient was taken by storm.Thus during the first few weeks Rieux was compelled to stay with the patient till the ambulance came.Later, when each doctor was accompanied by a volunteer police officer, Rieux could hurry away to the next patient.But, to begin with, every evening was like that evening when he was called in for Mme Loret’s daughter.He was shown into a small apartment decorated with fans and artificial flowers.The mother greeted him with a faltering smile."
"“哦，我希望这不是大家都在谈论着的那种发烧。”","“Oh, I do hope it’s not the fever everyone’s talking about.”"
"掀开床单和衬衣，医生默默地仔细观察病人大腿和肚子上的红斑，以及肿胀的淋巴结。那母亲看了一眼就发出尖叫，难以自制地痛哭起来。每天晚上，母亲们看到四肢和腹部上致命的症状就会胡思乱想、号啕大哭起来；每天晚上，她们的双手紧紧抓住里厄的胳臂，然后就是些无济于事的话、许诺和哭泣；每天晚上，越来越近的救护车的警笛声总是引起各种徒劳的悲伤的场面。除了会有很多这样的场面一再上演之外，里厄已没有什么其他的盼头。的确，像抽象观念一样，鼠疫是一成不变的；也许只有一样东西在变，那就是里厄自己。那晚他站在象征共和国的雕塑下时就有这种感觉。当他注视着朗贝尔走进那家旅馆的大门时，他只觉得一种无望的冷漠正慢慢地侵入全身。","Lifting the coverlet and chemise, he gazed in silence at the red blotches on the girl’s thighs and stomach, the swollen ganglia.After one glance the mother broke into shrill, uncontrollable cries of grief.And every evening mothers wailed thus, with a distraught abstraction, as their eyes fell on those fatal stigmata on limbs and bellies; every evening hands gripped Rieux’s arms, there was a rush of useless words, promises, and tears; every evening the nearing tocsin of the ambulance provoked scenes as vain as every form of grief.Rieux had nothing to look forward to but a long sequence of such scenes, renewed again and again.Yes, plague, like abstraction, was monotonous; perhaps only one factor changed, and that was Rieux himself.Standing at the foot of the statue of the Republic that evening, he felt it; all he was conscious of was a bleak indifference steadily gaining on him as he gazed at the door of the hotel Rambert had just entered."
"令人筋疲力尽的几周过去之后，看到夜幕降临后市民们涌上街头毫无目的地闲逛时，里厄知道自己不再需要狠下心来对抗自己的同情心了。当同情心于事无补时，人们就渐渐失去了同情心。而且，在这种心灵渐渐自我关闭起来的感觉中，医生在那段不堪重负的日子里找到了一种慰藉，他唯一的慰藉。他知道，这将有助于他更轻松地完成他的任务，因此，他感到高兴。当他凌晨两点回到家，他面对母亲时脸上茫然的表情令他母亲感到震惊；她为里厄当时唯一能做的减轻压力的做法感到痛心。要与抽象观念作斗争，就得让自己的心硬起来。但怎能期望朗贝尔理解这一点呢？","After these wearing weeks, after all those nightfalls when the townsfolk poured into the streets to roam them aimlessly, Rieux had learned that he need no longer steel himself against pity.One grows out of pity when it’s useless.And in this feeling that his heart had slowly closed in on itself, the doctor found a solace, his only solace, for the almost unendurable burden of his days.This, he knew, would make his task easier, and therefore he was glad of it.When he came home at two in the morning and his mother was shocked at the blank look he gave her, she was deploring precisely the sole alleviation Rieux could then experience.To fight abstraction you must have something of it in your own make-up.But how could Rambert be expected to grasp that?"
"抽象观念对朗贝尔来说就是阻碍他获得幸福的东西。实际上，里厄得承认，在某种意义上说，这位记者是对的。但是，他也知道，抽象观念有时比幸福更重要。而那时，也只有在那种情况下，必须要考虑这种抽象观念。这也是朗贝尔将要面临的处境，就像很久之后里厄医生从朗贝尔那里听到的更多关于他自己的叙述中了解到的一样。这样，里厄得以在一个不同的层面继续他的生活，而且，在这里，个人幸福与关于鼠疫的抽象观念之间的沉闷斗争也在展开——这构成了本城居民很长一段时间里的全部生活。","Abstraction for him was all that stood in the way of his happiness.Indeed, Rieux had to admit the journalist was right, in one sense.But he knew, too, that abstraction sometimes proves itself stronger than happiness; and then, if only then, it has to be taken into account.And this was what was going to happen to Rambert, as the doctor was to learn when, much later, Rambert told him more about himself.Thus he was enabled to follow, and on a different plane, the dreary struggle in progress between each man’s happiness and the abstractions of the plague—which constituted the whole life of our town over a long period of time."
"第十章","Chapter 10"
"然而，有些人看到的是抽象，另一些人却看到了事实。伴随着瘟疫的再次肆虐以及帕纳卢神父一次言辞激烈的布道，鼠疫爆发后的第一个月在无望中结束了。这位神父就是在米歇尔老头刚发病那会儿踉跄着走回家时搀扶过他的耶稣会教士。帕纳卢神父因为经常向奥兰地理协会的杂志投稿而成名。这些稿件主要是有关古代碑文问题，在这方面他是个权威。不过他也曾就现代个人主义的话题作过一系列演讲，在这方面他赢得了更多的听众，他们都是非专业人士。在演讲中，他表明了自己是一名坚定的斗士，捍卫着至真至纯的天主教教义，让它既远离现代放荡主义，又远离过去的蒙昧主义。在这些场合，他从不畏惧用一些逆耳忠言来痛斥听众。因此，他在当地享有盛誉。","But where some saw abstraction others saw the truth.The first month of the plague ended gloomily, with a violent recrudescence of the epidemic and a dramatic sermon preached by Father Paneloux, the Jesuit priest who had given an arm to old Michel when he was tottering home at the start of his illness.Father Paneloux had already made his mark with frequent contributions to the Oran Geographical Society; these dealt chiefly with ancient inscriptions, on which he was an authority.But he had also reached a wider, non-specialist public with a series of lectures on present-day individualism.In these he had shown himself a stalwart champion of Christian doctrine at its most precise and purest, equally remote from modern laxity and the obscurantism of the past.On these occasions he had not shrunk from trouncing his hearers with some vigorous home-truths.Hence his local celebrity."
"在鼠疫发生将近一个月的时候，奥兰城教会权威决定拿起最适合自己的武器来与鼠疫作斗争，于是组织了一次祈祷周活动。这种群众表示虔诚的宗教活动以周日的大弥撒结束。这场弥撒是为纪念圣罗克——一位被鼠疫夺去生命的圣人而进行的，而帕纳卢神父则被邀请去进行布道。两周前他就停下了关于圣奥古斯丁和非洲教会的研究工作，这工作为他在所属修道会中赢得了很高的地位。这位天性热情而充满激情的神父全身心地投入到教会安排给他的这项任务当中。在这次布道之前，人们已经对这个话题谈论已久，而且这次布道本身也标志着这一时期中的一件大事。　参加祈祷周活动的人很多。但是，不要以为奥兰市民平时就特别虔诚。比如说，在星期天早晨，海水浴就常常跟去教堂做祈祷较着劲。也不要认为他们是受到巨大的感召而突然改变了心性。这只是因为，首先城封了，港口不准进入了，他们不可能再去洗海水浴；此外，他们处于一种非常特别的心境之中，尽管他们在内心深处根本没有意识到发生在他们身上的问题的严重性，但他们也能感觉到，由于一些很明显的原因，情况确实有点变化。然而，有很多人仍然盼望着这场传染病很快就会过去，他们和他们的家人都会安然无恙。因此，他们觉得还没有义务在生活习惯上作任何改变。对他们而言，鼠疫只是一个不速之客，有一天它一定会不期然地离去，正如它悄然来临一样。他们感到害怕，但远还没有到绝望的地步，还没有到把鼠疫看作他们生活的全部这样的阶段，也还不到忘却昔日生活的时刻。总之，他们在等待情况出现转机。对待宗教——如同对待许多其他问题一样——鼠疫使他们的思想处于一种奇特的状态，既不冷漠，也不热情。也许，用“客观”一词来形容最为恰当。大多数参加祈祷周活动的人一定会附和里厄医生听过的一个常去做礼拜的人所说的话：“不管怎样，这没有任何坏处。”甚至连塔鲁在笔记中记录了中国人在类似情况下用敲鼓的方法来驱赶瘟神之后，又指出，事实上，没有办法说明敲鼓是否比防疫措施更有效。他只是加了这些话：为了解决问题，我们首先需要弄清楚瘟神是否真的存在，不清楚这一点，谈论任何其他的想法都是没有用的。","Toward the end of the month the ecclesiastical authorities in our town resolved to do battle against the plague with the weapons appropriate to them, and organized a Week of Prayer.These manifestations of public piety were to be concluded on Sunday by a High Mass celebrated under the auspices of St. Roch, the plague-stricken saint, and Father Paneloux was asked to preach the sermon.For a fortnight he desisted from the research work on St. Augustine and the African Church that had won for him a high place in his Order.A man of a passionate, fiery temperament, he flung himself wholeheartedly into the task assigned him.The sermon was a topic” of conversation long before it was delivered and, in its way, it marks an important date in the history of the period.There were large attendances at the services of the Week of Prayer.It must not, however, be assumed that in normal times the townsfolk of Oran are particularly devout.On Sunday mornings, for instance, sea-bathing competes seriously with churchgoing.Nor must it be thought that they had seen a great light and had a sudden change of heart.But, for one thing, now that the town was closed and the harbor out of bounds, there was no question of bathing; moreover, they were in a quite exceptional frame of mind and, though in their heart of hearts they were far from recognizing the enormity of what had come on them, they couldn’t help feeling, for obvious reasons, that decidedly something had changed.Nevertheless, many continued hoping that the epidemic would soon die out and they and their families be spared.Thus they felt under no obligation to make any change in their habits as yet.Plague was for them an unwelcome visitant, bound to take its leave one day as unexpectedly as it had come.Alarmed, but far from desperate, they hadn’t yet reached the phase when plague would seem to them the very tissue of their existence; when they forgot the lives that until now it had been given them to lead.In short, they were waiting for the turn of events.With regard to religion—as to many other problems—plague had induced in them a curious frame of mind, as remote from indifference as from fervor; the best name to give it, perhaps, might be “objectivity.”Most of those who took part in the Week of Prayer would have echoed a remark made by one of the churchgoers in Dr. Rieux’s hearing: “Anyhow, it can’t do any harm.”Even Tarrou, after recording in his notebook that in such cases the Chinese fall to playing tambourines before the Genius of Plague, observed that there was no means of telling whether, in practice, tambourines proved more efficacious than prophylactic measures.He merely added that, to decide the point, we should need first to ascertain if a Genius of Plague actually existed, and our ignorance on this point nullified any opinions we might form."
"不管怎样，整个祈祷周期间，教堂里确实总是挤满了信徒。头两三天，许多人还呆在外面，在门廊前花园里的棕榈树和石榴树下，远远地聆听着在邻街不断回响着的此起彼伏的祷告声和乞灵声。可是一旦有人带头，他们就开始走进教堂，胆怯地加入到祈祷当中。而在周日布道那天，大批人群涌入教堂中殿，连台阶上和教堂周围都挤满了人。前一天，天空就已乌云密布，而现在正下着倾盆大雨。站在外面的那些人撑着雨伞。教堂里弥漫着一股浓浓的炉香和湿衣服的味道。这时，帕纳卢神父步入讲道台。","In any case the Cathedral was practically always full of worshippers throughout the Week of Prayer.For the first two or three days many stayed outside, under the palms and pomegranate trees in the garden in front of the porch, and listened from a distance to the swelling tide of prayers and invocations whose backwash filled the neighboring streets.But once an example had been given, they began to enter the Cathedral and join timidly in the responses.And on the Sunday of the sermon a huge congregation filled the nave, overflowing on to the steps and precincts.The sky had clouded up on the previous day, and now it was raining heavily.Those in the open unfurled umbrellas.The air inside the Cathedral was heavy with fumes of incense and the smell of wet clothes when Father Paneloux stepped into the pulpit."
"他中等个子，身材健壮。当他靠在讲道台边，用粗大的双手抓住木栏时，人们看到的只是一个巨大的黑色躯干，再往上，红润的面颊上架着一副钢丝边眼镜。他的声音洪亮而富有激情，可以传得很远，而他一开口就以清楚有力的声音对会众说：“我的兄弟们，苦难已经降临到你们身上，我的兄弟们，你们是罪有应得。”连门廊外矗立在雨中的人群都发出一阵骚动。按严格的逻辑来说，神父接下来所说的话，似乎和这个扣人心弦的开场白并不连贯。只有继续听讲道，听众方才明白，帕纳卢神父运用巧妙的演讲技巧，有如当头一棒，道出了他整个讲道的主旨。说完了第一句话，神父马上引用了《出埃及记》中关于埃及发生瘟疫的原文，说：“在历史上第一次出现这种灾难是为了打击天主的敌人。法老违反天意，而瘟疫迫使他屈服。天主降灾，使那些狂妄自大和顽固抗主的人臣服于他的脚下，有史以来一直如此。仔细想想吧，朋友们，跪下吧。”","He was a stockily built man, of medium height.When he leaned on the edge of the pulpit, grasping the woodwork with his big hands, all one saw was a black, massive torso and, above it, two rosy cheeks overhung by steel-rimmed spectacles.He had a powerful, rather emotional delivery, which carried to a great distance, and when he launched at the congregation his opening phrase in clear, emphatic tones: “Calamity has come on you, my brethren, and, my brethren, you deserved it” there was a flutter that extended to the crowd massed in the rain outside the porch.In strict logic what came next did not seem to follow from this dramatic opening.Only as the sermon proceeded did it become apparent to the congregation that, by a skillful oratorical device, Father Paneloux had launched at them, like a fisticuff, the gist of his whole discourse.After launching it he went on at once to quote a text from Exodus relating to the plague of Egypt, and said: “The first time this scourge appears in history, it was wielded to strike down the enemies of God.Pharaoh set himself up against the divine will, and the plague beat him to his knees.Thus from the dawn of recorded history the scourge of God has humbled the proud of heart and laid low those who hardened themselves against Him.Ponder this well, my friends, and fall on your knees.”"
"雨下得越来越大，暴雨敲打着窗户的声音使教堂内显得更加肃静，而神父的话打破了这种沉寂。有几个听道的人，犹豫了片刻后，从他们的座位上滑下，跪倒在地。其他人认为应该效仿，于是从教堂的一端到另一端，全体听道的人一个接一个地都跪了下去。除了偶尔有几声椅子的嘎嘎声，再没有其他声响。这时帕纳卢直起身来，深吸了一口气，用强劲有力的声音继续他的讲道。","The downpour had increased in violence, and these words, striking through a silence intensified by the drumming of raindrops on the chancel windows, carried such conviction that, after a momentary hesitation, some of the worshippers slipped forward from their seats on to their knees.Others felt it right to follow their example, and the movement gradually spread until presently everyone was kneeling, from end to end of the cathedral.No sound, except an occasional creak of chairs, accompanied the movement.Then Paneloux drew himself up to his full height, took a deep breath, and continued his sermon in a voice that gathered strength as it proceeded."
"“如果瘟疫降临到你们头上，那是因为你们思考的时候到了。正义之人不必惧怕，但恶者则该发抖。因为鼠疫是天主的连枷，人间是天主的脱粒场，天主会毫不留情地摔打庄稼，直到麦粒从麦杆上脱下为止。麦杆总是比麦粒多，受上天召唤的人当中只有极少数人受苦。但这种不幸并非天主所愿。这个世界纵容罪恶已经太久，依靠天主的怜悯与谅解已经太久。人们以为只要忏悔就够了，什么罪过都可以犯。每个人都有恃无恐，到时候，他只要停止罪行，然后忏悔就行了。从现在一直到那一天，最容易做的就是得过且过，仁慈的天主会安排余下的事情。很久以来，天主都是以仁慈的目光俯视着这座城市，但他已不耐烦再等了，他已期待太久，现在他已掉转脸去了。因此，失去了天主的灵光，我们在黑暗中，在浓浓的瘟疫的黑暗中前行。”会众中有人像一匹不耐烦的马似的哼了一声。停顿了一小会儿，神父以更为低沉的声音继续他的讲道。","“If today the plague is in your midst, that is because the hour has struck for taking thought.The just man need have no fear, but the evildoer has good cause to tremble.For plague is the flail of God and the world His threshing-floor, and implacably He will thresh out His harvest until the wheat is separated from the chaff.There will be more chaff than wheat, few chosen of the many called.Yet this calamity was not willed by God.Too long this world of ours has connived at evil, too long has it counted on the divine mercy, on God’s forgiveness.Repentance was enough, men thought; nothing was forbidden.Everyone felt comfortably assured; when the day came, he would surely turn from his sins and repent.Pending that day, the easiest course was to surrender all along the line; divine compassion would do the rest.For a long while God gazed down on this town with eyes of compassion; but He grew weary of waiting, His eternal hope was too long deferred, and now He has turned His face away from us.And so, God’s light withdrawn, we walk in darkness, in the thick darkness of this plague.”Someone in the congregation gave a little snort, like that of a restive horse.After a short silence the preacher continued in a lower tone."
"“在《金色传奇》中，我们读到，在翁伯托国王时期，鼠疫在意大利肆虐，在罗马和帕维亚地区尤为猖獗。情况非常可怕，活着的人几乎不够埋葬死者。当时有一位善神现身，给一个手持巨大猎矛的恶神下令，吩咐他击打房屋。他在一幢房子上击打多少下，这幢房子里就得死多少人。”","“We read in the Golden Legend that in the time of King Umberto Italy was swept by plague and its greatest ravages took place in Rome and Pavia.So dreadful were these that the living hardly sufficed to bury the dead.And a good angel was made visible to human eyes, giving his orders to an evil angel who bore a great huntingspear, and bidding him strike the houses; and as many strokes as he dealt a house, so many dead were carried out of it.”"
"这时，帕纳卢朝着教堂入口处伸出两条短短的胳臂，好像是在指着飘摇雨幕后的什么东西似的。","Here Paneloux stretched forth his two short arms toward the open porch, as if pointing to something behind the tumbling curtain of the rain."
"“我的兄弟们，”他大喊道，“现在那致命的狩猎正在进行，正侵袭着我们的街道。看，那位瘟神就在那里，像路西法一样美丽，像魔王一样神气！他正在你们的屋顶上空徘徊，右手握着长矛，摆好了出击的姿势。左手伸出来，指向你们的某幢房子。也许就在此刻，他正指向你们的家门，红色的长矛撞击着壁板，甚至就在此时，瘟疫正走进你们的家中，坐在你们的卧室里等着你们回家。它不慌不忙，全神贯注，正在等待时机，一切就像已被安排好了一样无法逃避。世上没有任何力量，不——记住我的话——一旦它将手伸向你们，哪怕是自吹自擂的人类科学也不能将你们从它手中拯救。结果，你们就像在血染的脱粒场上被痛苦地打下来的麦粒一样，和麦杆一起被扔掉了。”　","“My brothers,” he cried, “that fatal hunt is up, and harrying our streets today.See him there, that angel of the pestilence, comely as Lucifer, shining like Evil’s very self!He is hovering above your roofs with his great spear in his right hand, poised to strike, while his left hand is stretched toward one or other of your houses.Maybe at this very moment his finger is pointing to your door, the red spear crashing on its panels, and even now the plague is entering your home and settling down in your bedroom to await your return.Patient and watchful, ineluctable as the order of the scheme of things, it bides its time.No earthly power, nay, not even—mark me well—the vaunted might of human science can avail you to avert that hand once it is stretched toward you.And winnowed like corn on the blood-stained threshing-floor of suffering, you will be cast away with the chaff.”"
"讲到这里，神父用他出色的口才重新提起那个连枷的象征。他要他的听众们想象一根巨大的长矛在城市上空挥舞，随意地击打一下，然后再鲜血淋漓地举起，将鲜血和痛苦一起撒向地面，“作为来日收获真理的种子”。","At this point the Father reverted with heightened eloquence to the symbol of the flail.He bade his hearers picture a huge wooden bar whirling above the town, striking at random, swinging up again in a shower of drops of blood, and spreading carnage and suffering on earth, “for the seedtime that shall prepare the harvest of the truth.”"
"讲完这一长段话后，帕纳卢神父停顿了一下。他的头发散乱地披在额前，浑身颤抖着，双手带动着讲道台也抖动了起来。再次说话时，他的声音更加低沉，但带有强烈的谴责的语气。","At the end of his long phrase Father Paneloux paused; his hair was straggling over his forehead, his body shaken by tremors that his hands communicated to the pulpit.When he spoke again, his voice was lower, but vibrant with accusation."
"“是的，认真思考的时候到了。你们天真地以为每周日来朝拜一次天主就够了，其余日子就可以自由自在了。你们认为一些小礼节，一些跪拜动作就足可以抵消你们罪恶的冷漠了。但天主是不会被愚弄的。他热切地想要向你们表达他的爱，而这种短暂的相见不能使他心满意足。他希望见到你们的时间更长，次数更频繁，这是他爱你们的方式，实际上，这是爱的唯一方式。这就是为什么他让灾难降临到你们头上，因为他已厌烦了等待。有史以来，他都是这样对待一切冒犯了他的城市。现在你们正在接受教训，该隐及其子孙、所多马和蛾摩拉的人民、约伯和法老以及所有顽固抗主的人都得到过这样的教训。自从城门将你们和鼠疫关在一起开始，你们像上述那些人一样，已经开始用新的眼光来审视人类和天地万物了。现在，你们终于明白，该是认真思考根本问题的时候了。”","“Yes, the hour has come for serious thought.You fondly imagined it was enough to visit God on Sundays, and thus you could make free of your weekdays.You believed some brief formalities, some bendings of the knee, would recompense Him well enough for your criminal indifference.But God is not mocked.These brief encounters could not sate the fierce hunger of His love.He wished to see you longer and more often; that is His manner of loving and, indeed, it is the only manner of loving.And this is why, wearied of waiting for you to come to Him, He loosed on you this visitation; as He has visited all the cities that offended against Him since the dawn of history.Now you are learning your lesson, the lesson that was learned by Cain and his offspring, by the people of Sodom and Gomorrah, by Job and Pharaoh, by all that hardened their hearts against Him.And like them you have been beholding mankind and all creation with new eyes, since the gates of this city closed on you and on the pestilence.Now, at last, you know the hour has struck to bend your thoughts to first and last things.”"
"一股潮湿的风刮进教堂中殿，蜡烛的火焰摇曳着，闪烁不定。在浓烈的蜡烛味、咳嗽声和喷嚏声中，帕纳卢神父一面以非常巧妙、令人赞赏的方式重新提起他的开场白，一面继续以平静的、几乎不带感情的声音说：“我知道，你们当中有很多人都在揣测我的讲话是何用意。我要把你们引向真理，让你们感到高兴，是的，高兴——尽管我说了刚才那番话。现在不再是用一只友爱的手或是用些友好的劝告就可以让你们走上正确道路的时候了。今天，真理就是命令。一支红色的长矛正坚决地指向那条小道，那条救赎之路。因此，兄弟们，上天的仁慈最终显露无疑，他在一切事物上都安排了善恶两面：愤怒和怜悯，瘟疫和你们的救赎。这场正在残害着你们的鼠疫，也能超度你们，为你们指明道路。”","A wet wind was sweeping up the nave, making the candle-flames bend and flicker.The pungency of burning wax, coughs, a stifled sneeze, rose toward Father Paneloux, who, reverting to his exordium with a subtlety that was much appreciated, went on in a calm, almost matter-of-fact voice: “Many of you are wondering, I know, what I am leading up to.I wish to lead you to the truth and teach you to rejoice, yes, rejoice—in spite of all that I have been telling you.For the time is past when a helping hand or mere words of good advice could set you on the right path.Today the truth is a command.It is a red spear sternly pointing to the narrow path, the one way of salvation.And thus, my brothers, at last it is revealed to you, the divine compassion which has ordained good and evil in everything; wrath and pity; the plague and your salvation.This same pestilence which is slaying you works for your good and points your path."
"“很久以前，阿比西尼亚的基督徒们把瘟疫看作是一种上天所赐的获得永生的有效方法。那些没有得病的人把自己裹在瘟疫病人用过的床单里以求必死。我承认，这种要求救赎的疯狂做法不值得推荐。这是一种草率的行为——实际上，是一种我们强烈反对的自行其是。没人可以强迫天主的意志或是让指定的时刻快点到来，加速天主早已安排好的、不可更改的命令的做法只会导致走向异端。但我们仍然可以从那些阿比西尼亚教徒的热忱中汲取有益的教训，尽管他们过度热忱了。他们的这种做法有背于我们的开明精神，但让我们瞥见了明亮的永生之光，虽然只是一团弱小而安静的火焰，在人类痛苦的黑暗深渊隐隐散发着光芒。这道光也照亮了那条通向解脱的昏暗之路。它显示了万无一失、能变恶为善的的上天意志。今天，它又一次引领我们通过这条充满恐惧和呻吟的黑暗道路，把我们引向神圣的安宁，那一切生命的本源。朋友们，这就是我要带给你们的巨大安慰，希望你们离开这座天主的圣堂时，带走的不仅仅是愤怒的话语，还有使你们内心感到安慰的福音。”","“Many centuries ago the Christians of Abyssinia saw in the plague a sure and God-sent means of winning eternal life.Those who were not yet stricken wrapped round them sheets in which men had died of plague, so as to make sure of their death.I grant you such a frenzied quest of salvation was not to be commended.It shows an overhaste—indeed, a presumptuousness, which we can but deplore.No man should seek to force God’s hand or to hurry on the appointed hour, and from a practice that aims at speeding up the order of events which God has ordained unalterably from all time, it is but a step to heresy.Yet we can learn a salutary lesson from the zeal, excessive though it was, of those Abyssinian Christians.Much of it is alien to our more enlightened spirits, and yet it gives us a glimpse of that radiant eternal light which glows, a small still flame, in the dark core of human suffering.And this light, too, illuminates the shadowed paths that lead towards deliverance.It reveals the will of God in action, unfailingly transforming evil into good.And once again today it is leading us through the dark valley of fears and groans towards the holy silence, the wellspring of all life.This, my friends, is the vast consolation I would hold out to you, so that when you leave this house of God you will carry away with you not only words of wrath, but a message, too, of comfort for your hearts.”"
"大家以为布道已经结束了。外面，雨停了，充满水气的阳光给教堂前的广场抹上了一片金黄。街上隐隐传来说话声，还有汽车的嘈杂声，这是苏醒的城市之声。会众们在一片压抑着的骚动声中小心翼翼地收拾他们的东西。","Everyone supposed that the sermon had ended.Outside, the rain had ceased and watery sunshine was yellowing the Cathedral square.Vague sounds of voices came from the streets, and a low hum of traffic, the speech of an awakening town.Discreetly, with a subdued rustling, the congregation gathered together their belongings."
"但是，神父又说了几句话。他说，在阐明了鼠疫是天主用来惩罚人类罪恶的手段之后，在他结束发言之际，鉴于事件的悲剧性，他不打算再说什么了，因为那样就太不合时宜了。他希望，而且也相信，大家现在真正看清了自己的状况。但是，在离开讲道台之前，他想告诉人们他在一本关于马赛大鼠疫的老纪事书中读到的一些东西。在这本书中，作者马蒂厄·马雷大发感叹，他说自己已被打入地狱，承受着既无助又无望的煎熬。哦，马蒂厄·马雷是瞎子！帕纳卢神父感到他从来没有像今天这样深切地体会到天主赐予所有人的神圣的帮助和基督教的希望。他唯一的希望是，不管这些黑暗的日子有多可怕，不管痛苦的人们发出怎样的呻吟，我们的市民都会向上天发出虔诚教徒的祈祷，一种爱的祈祷。其余的事情，天主自会作出安排。","However, the Father had a few more words to say.He told them that after having made it clear that this plague came from God for the punishment of their sins, he would not have recourse, in concluding, to an eloquence that, considering the tragic nature of the occasion, would be out of keeping.He hoped and believed that all of them now saw their position in its true light.But, before leaving the pulpit, he would like to tell them of something he had been reading in an old chronicle of the Black Death at Marseille.In it Mathieu Marais, the chronicler, laments his lot; he says he has been cast into hell to languish without succor and without hope.Well, Mathieu Marais was blind!Never more intensely than today had he, Father Paneloux, felt the immanence of divine succor and Christian hope granted to all alike.He hoped against hope that, despite all the horrors of these dark days, despite the groans of men and women in agony, our fellow citizens would offer up to heaven that one prayer which is truly Christian, a prayer of love.And God would see to the rest."
"第十一章","Chapter 11 "
"很难说这次布道是否对我们的市民起到了任何作用。奥顿先生，那位地方治安官，向里厄医生保证，他发现神父的观点“绝对无可辩驳”。但并非每个人都持有如此绝对的观点。对某些人来说，这次布道只是让他们明白了他们是因犯了什么不知名的罪而被判处了一段不确定期限的惩罚这一事实。有好些人设法适应这种监禁，继续过着以前那种平凡的生活，而另一些反抗者则一心想要逃离这座牢笼。","It is hard to say if this sermon had any effect on our townsfolk.M. Othon, the magistrate, assured Dr. Rieux that he had found the preacher’s arguments “absolutely irrefutable.”But not everyone took so unqualified a view.To some the sermon simply brought home the fact that they had been sentenced, for an unknown crime, to an indeterminate period of punishment.And while a good many people adapted themselves to confinement and carried on their humdrum lives as before, there were others who rebelled and whose one idea now was to break loose from the prison-house."
"起初，人们还或多或少能从容地忍受同外界隔绝这一事实，就像他们本可以忍受任何仅仅扰乱了他们某些生活习惯的暂时性的麻烦一样。但是，由于他们突然发觉自己正在遭受苍穹之下的某种监禁，开始炎炎夏日里的煎熬，他们模糊地感觉到目前的局势已威胁到自己整个的生活。于是到了晚上，当凉爽的空气使他们的精力得以恢复之时，这种像囚犯一样被监禁的感觉有时会促使他们干出一些鲁莽的事情来。","At first the fact of being cut off from the outside world was accepted with a more or less good grace, much as people would have put up with any other temporary inconvenience that interfered with only a few of their habits.But, now they had abruptly become aware that they were undergoing a sort of incarceration under that blue dome of sky, already beginning to sizzle in the fires of summer, they had a vague sensation that their whole lives were threatened by the present turn of events, and in the evening, when the cooler air revived their energy, this feeling of being locked in like criminals prompted them sometimes to foolhardy acts."
"值得注意的是——不知是否出于巧合——从布道的这个星期日开始，恐惧般的情绪深深地影响着这个城市，足以使人猜想到市民们正是在这个时候开始明白他们的真实处境。从这个角度来看，这个城市的气氛有些变了。但是，实际上，究竟是气氛变了还是心理变了，还是个问题。","It is noteworthy—this may or may not have been due to mere coincidence—that this Sunday of the sermon marked the beginning of something like a widespread panic in the town, and it took so deep a hold as to lead one to suspect that only now had the true nature of their situation dawned on our townspeople.Seen from this angle, the atmosphere of the town was somewhat changed.But, actually, it was a problem whether the change was in the atmosphere or in their hearts."
"布道后没几天，当里厄在去往市郊的路上与格朗谈论着这一变化的时候，他在黑暗中撞上了一个站在路中央左右摇晃、止步不前的男子。正在这时，亮得越来越晚的路灯突然都亮了起来，里厄及同伴身后的一盏灯照亮了这位男子的脸。他紧闭双眼，无声地笑着。大滴大滴的汗水从那张笑得不断抽搐的脸上流淌下来。","A few days after the sermon, when Rieux, on his way to one of the outlying districts of the town, was discussing the change with Grand, he collided in the darkness with a man who was standing in the middle of the pavement swaying from side to side without trying to advance.At the same moment the street-lamps, which were being lit later and later in the evening, went on suddenly, and a lamp just behind Rieux and his companion threw its light full on the man’s face.His eyes were shut and he was laughing soundlessly.Big drops of sweat were rolling down the face convulsed with silent merriment."
"“整个一个疯子。”格朗说。","“A lunatic at large,” Grand observed."
"里厄挽住格朗的胳臂，带着他继续往前走，这时他发觉格朗正在剧烈地哆嗦着。","Rieux took his arm and was shepherding him on when he noticed that Grand was trembling violently."
"“如果再继续这样下去，”里厄说，“整座城市就会变成疯人院。”他感到很累，喉咙里干极了。“咱们喝点儿东西吧。”","“If things go on as they are going,” Rieux remarked, “the whole town will be a madhouse.”He felt exhausted, his throat was parched.“Let’s have a drink.”"
"他们转身进了一家小咖啡馆。唯一的光线来自吧台上的一盏台灯，沉重的空气中透出一种古怪的淡红色，而人们不知出于何种原因，都在轻声地交谈着。","They turned into a small cafe.The only light came from a lamp over the bar, the heavy air had a curious reddish tinge, and for no apparent reason everyone was speaking in undertones."
"令里厄感到惊讶的是，格朗要了一小杯烈性酒，一饮而尽。“这酒真够烈的！”他说，过了一会儿，他提议离开。","To the doctor’s surprise Grand asked for a small glass of straight liquor, which he drank off at a gulp.“Fiery stuff!” he observed; then, a moment later, suggested making a move."
"走到大街上，里厄似乎感觉到黑夜里到处都是细语声。从路灯上面黑暗的夜空深处传来一阵飒飒响动，使他联想起帕纳卢谈到过的无形的连枷正在不断搅动着失去活力的空气。","Out in the street it seemed to Rieux that the night was full of whispers.Somewhere in the black depths above the street-lamps there was a low soughing that brought to his mind that unseen flail threshing incessantly the languid air of which Paneloux had spoken."
"“幸好，幸好。”格朗嘟囔着，又顿了顿。","“Happily, happily,” Grand muttered, then paused."
"里厄问他想要说什么。","Rieux asked him what he had been going to say."
"“幸好，我有我的事情要做。”","“Happily, I’ve my work.”"
"“哦，是的，”里厄说，","“Ah yes,” Rieux said."
"“总之，这一点不错。”接着，为了不再听到那空气中怪异的呼啸声，他问格朗工作是否进展顺利。","“That’s something, anyhow.”Then, so as not to hear that eerie whistling in the air, he asked Grand if he was getting good results."
"“嗯，是的，我认为我的工作有了进展。”","“Well, yes, I think I’m making headway.”"
"“你还要继续做下去吗？”","“Have you much more to do?”"
"格朗显得异常兴奋，说话时也带有些醉意。","Grand began to show an animation unlike his usual self, and his voice took ardor from the liquor he had drunk."
"“我也不知道。但问题不在这里，医生，是的，我向你保证，问题不在这里。”","“I don’t know.But that’s not the point, doctor; yes, I can assure you that’s not the point.”"
"天太黑了，但里厄依稀感觉到格朗在挥舞着手臂。他似乎在准备着要说些什么，而他一开口，就滔滔不绝起来。","It was too dark to see clearly, but Rieux had the impression that he was waving his arms.He seemed to be working himself up to say something, and when he spoke, the words came with a rush."
"“医生，我真正希望的是这样：有朝一日当我的手稿交给出版商时，我希望他会站起身来——当然是在他读完手稿之后了——然后对他所有的员工说：‘先生们，脱帽致敬！’”","“What I really want, doctor, is this.On the day when the manuscript reaches the publisher, I want him to stand up—after he’s read it through, of course—and say to his staff: ‘Gentlemen, hats off!’” "
"里厄惊呆了，而更令他惊讶的是，他看到，或隐约看到他身边的这个男人把手举到头上，然后把手臂径直往前一挥，似乎在做脱帽甩帽的动作。头顶那怪异的呼啸声似乎越来越响。","Rieux was dumbfounded, and, to add to his amazement, he saw, or seemed to see, the man beside him making as if to take off his hat with a sweeping gesture, bringing his hand to his head, then holding his arm out straight in front of him.That queer whistling overhead seemed to gather force."
"“你知道，”格朗接着说，“应该做到完美无瑕。”","“So you see,” Grand added, “it’s got to be flawless.”"
"尽管里厄不太了解文学界，但他怀疑那里并不会出现这样生动的画面——比如说，出版社人员在办公室里也许就不会戴帽子。尽管里厄不太了解文学界，但他怀疑那里并不会出现这样生动的画面——比如说，出版社人员在办公室里也许就不会戴帽子。尽管他尽力不去听头顶上那怪异的声响，但他还是可以听到那瘟疫的低语声。他们已走到了格朗所住的地方，因为那里地势较高，他们感到凉爽的夜风拂过他们的面颊，同时也吹走了城里的喧闹声。","Though he knew little of the literary world, Rieux had a suspicion that things didn’t happen in it quite so picturesquely—that, for instance, publishers do not keep their hats on in their offices.But, of course, one never can tell, and Rieux preferred to hold his peace.Try as he might to shut his ears to it, he still was listening to that eerie sound above, the whispering of the plague.They had reached the part of the town where Grand lived and, as it was on a slight eminence, they felt the cool night breeze fanning their cheeks and at the same time carrying away from them the noises of the town."
"格朗还在继续说着，但里厄并没有完全听懂这位可敬的人在说些什么。他只听到说格朗所写的那本书已完成了很多页，而格朗几乎是绞尽了脑汁以使它尽善尽美。“想想吧，为了一个字，就可能要花上几晚，甚至几周！有时仅仅就为了一个连接词！”","Grand went on talking, but Rieux failed to follow all the worthy man was saying.All he gathered was that the work he was engaged on ran to a great many pages, and he was at almost excruciating pains to bring it to perfection.“Evenings, whole weeks, spent on one word, just think!Sometimes on a mere conjunction!”"
"格朗突然停下话来，抓住医生大衣上的一枚纽扣。他那张几乎没有牙齿的嘴里结结巴巴地说出一连串话来。","Grand stopped abruptly and seized the doctor by a button of his coat.The words came stumbling out of his almost toothless mouth."
"“我希望你能理解，医生。我认为在‘然而’和‘而且’之间作选择还很容易，在‘而且’和‘然后’之间作选择就有点难了。而真正最难的可能要数到底该不该用‘而且’这个问题了。”","“I’d like you to understand, doctor.I grant you it’s easy enough to choose between a ‘but’ and an ‘and.’ It’s a bit more difficult to decide between ‘and’ and ‘then.’ But definitely the hardest thing may be to know whether one should put an ‘and’ or leave it out.”"
"“对，”医生说，“我明白你的意思。”","“Yes,” Rieux said, “I see your point.”"
"他又继续往前走。格朗面露窘色，又追了上来。","He started walking again.Grand looked abashed, then stepped forward and drew level."
"“对不起，”他笨拙地说，“我也不知道今晚自己是怎么了。”","“Sorry,” he said awkwardly.“I don’t know what’s come over me this evening.”"
"里厄鼓励地拍了拍格朗的肩膀，说对他所说的事情很感兴趣，也愿意帮助他。格朗这才似乎安下心来，在走到他家门口时，他犹豫片刻之后就邀请医生进屋去坐坐。里厄答应了。","Rieux patted his shoulder encouragingly, saying he’d been much interested in what Grand had said and would like to help him.This seemed to reassure Grand, and when they reached his place he suggested, after some slight hesitation, that the doctor should come in for a moment.Rieux agreed."
"他们走进了饭厅，格朗请他坐在餐桌旁的一把椅子上，桌上摆满了稿纸，稿纸上的字迹很小，划了很多修改的叉叉。","They entered the dining-room and Grand gave him a chair beside a table strewn with sheets of paper covered with writing in a microscopic hand, criscrossed with corrections."
"“对，就是它，”格朗冲着医生疑惑的目光回答说，“那么你要喝点儿东西吗？我这有些酒。”","“Yes, that’s it,” he said in answer to the doctor’s questioning glance.“But won’t you drink something?I’ve some wine.”"
"里厄拒绝了。他正埋头看着稿纸。","Rieux declined.He was bending over the manuscript."
"“请别看了，”格朗说，“这是开头部分，它令我头疼，头疼得要命。”","“No, don’t look,” Grand said.“It’s my opening phrase, and it’s giving trouble, no end of trouble.”"
"他也在盯着餐桌上的那些稿纸，手不由自主地伸向其中的一张。最后，他把纸拿了起来，又把它凑到那没有罩子的灯泡下，好看得清楚些。纸在他手里抖动着，而且里厄注意到他的额头上冒着汗。","He too was gazing at the sheets of paper on the table, and his hand seemed irresistibly drawn to one of them.Finally he picked it up and held it to the shadeless electric bulb so that the light shone through.The paper shook in his hand and Rieux noticed that his forehead was moist with sweat."
"“请坐下，”医生说，“把它念给我听听。”","“Sit down,” he said, “and read it to me.”"
"“好的，”格朗眼神里和微笑中都露出些许感激的神情，“我也想念给你听听。”","“Yes.”There was a timid gratitude in Grand’s eyes and smile.“I think I’d like you to hear it.”"
"他盯着稿纸等了一小会儿，然后才坐下。与此同时，里厄在倾听着街上传来的一阵奇怪的嗡嗡声，好像是在回应瘟疫的飒飒声。就在那个时候，他异常清晰地感觉到这个城市，这个遭此大难、与世隔离的城市在他脚下伸展，感觉到黑夜里压抑着的痛苦的呻吟声。接着，他听到了格朗低沉而清晰的声音。“在五月份的一个美丽的清晨，一位年轻优雅的女骑士骑着一匹漂亮的枣骝雌马，驰骋在花香四溢的布洛涅林阴大道上。”","He waited for a while, still gazing at the writing, then sat down.Meanwhile Rieux was listening to the curious buzzing sound that was rising from the streets as if in answer to the soughings of the plague.At that moment he had a preternaturally vivid awareness of the town stretched out below, a victim world secluded and apart, and of the groans of agony stifled in its darkness.Then, pitched low but clear, Grand’s voice came to his ears.“One fine morning in the month of May an elegant young horsewoman might have been seen riding a handsome sorrel mare along the flowery avenues of the Bois de Boulogne.”"
"两人都不作声了，又听见这座沮丧的城市所发出的模糊不清的嘈杂声。格朗放下了稿纸，仍然盯着它看。过了一会儿，他抬起头来。","Silence returned, and with it the vague murmur of the prostrate town.Grand had put down the sheet and was still staring at it.After a while he looked up."
"“你觉得怎么样？”","“What do you think of it?”"
"里厄回答说，这个开头激起了他的好奇心，他想听听下文。对此，格朗说医生的想法完全错了。他显得很兴奋，用手掌拍了拍桌上的稿纸。","Rieux replied that this opening phrase had whetted his curiosity; he’d like to hear what followed.Whereat Grand told him he’d got it all wrong.He seemed excited and slapped the papers on the table with the flat of his hand."
"“这仅仅是初稿。一旦我能把我想象的画面完美地表达出来，一旦我的句子能与骑马小跑的节奏完全合拍——一、二、三，一、二、三，你了解我的意思吗？——那么其余的事情就简单多了，而且，尤为重要的是，想象力如此丰富，就有可能让他们读过开头几句就说：‘脱帽致敬！’","“That’s only a rough draft.Once I’ve succeeded in rendering perfectly the picture in my mind’s eye, once my words have the exact tempo of this ride—the horse is trotting, one-two-three, one-two-three, see what I mean?—the rest will come more easily and, what’s even more important, the illusion will be such that from the very first words it will be possible to say: ‘Hats off!’"
"但在这之前，他承认还有很多艰苦的工作要做。他从未想过就这样把稿子拿去付印。尽管这个句子有时令他满意，但他很清楚这写得还不太成功，而且，在某种程度上，这个句子流利的笔调使它或多或少接近于陈词滥调。至少格朗是这样说的，这时，他们听到窗外大街上传来人们奔跑的脚步声。里厄站起身来。","But before that, he admitted, there was lots of hard work to be done.He’d never dream of handing that sentence to the printer in its present form.For though it sometimes satisfied him, he was fully aware it didn’t quite hit the mark as yet, and also that to some extent it had a facility of tone approximating, remotely perhaps, but recognizably, to the commonplace.That was more or less what he was saying when they heard the sound of people running in the street below the window.Rieux stood up."
"“等着瞧我的作品吧，”格朗说着，朝窗外望了望，加了句，“当这一切完工的时候。”","“Just wait and see what I make of it,” Grand said, and, glancing toward the window, added: “When all this is over.”"
"而这时又传来了急促的脚步声。里厄已下楼去了，当他走上了大街，有两个人从他身边跑了过去。他们好像是在向一个城门口跑去。","But then the sound of hurried footsteps came again.Rieux was already halfway down the stairs, and when he stepped out into the street two men brushed past him.They seemed to be on their way to one of the town gates."
"事实上，我们有些市民被炎热和鼠疫弄得失去了理智。已经出现了一些暴力事件，每晚都有人试图绕过哨兵，逃出城去。","In fact, what with the heat and the plague, some of our fellow citizens were losing their heads; there had already been some scenes of violence and nightly attempts were made to elude the sentries and escape to the outside world."
"第十二章","Chapter 12"
"其他人，比如说像朗贝尔那样的，也在设法逃离这种越来越恐慌的气氛，不过他们更有技巧，也更能坚持，但成功率可能不会更高。朗贝尔继续与官员们周旋了一段时间。据他所说，他一直认为坚持就必然会胜利，也正如他所指出的那样，说起来，在紧急情况下他可利用的资源还是很丰富的。因此，他坚持不懈地拜访各类官员以及其他一些在正常情况下很有影响力的人。但结果却是，他们以往的影响力不起作用了。他们当中大部分人对出口、银行、水果和酒类贸易等诸方面都有明确而可靠的见解，他们在处理有关保险、合同争端等问题上具有毋庸置疑的能力，他们的资历很高，能力也明显出众。事实上，他们身上最突出的特点是——他们的能力出众。但在鼠疫的问题上，他们的能力几乎为零。","Others, too, Rambert for example, were trying to escape from this atmosphere of growing panic, but with more skill and persistence, if not with greater success.For a while Rambert had gone on struggling with officialdom.If he was to be believed, he had always thought that perseverance would win through, inevitably, and, as he pointed out, resourcefulness in emergency was up his street, in a manner of speaking.So he plodded away, calling on all sorts of officials and others whose influence would have had weight in normal conditions.But, as things were, such influence was unavailing.For the most part they were men with well-defined and sound ideas on everything concerning exports, banking, the fruit or wine trade; men of proved ability in handling problems relating to insurance, the interpretation of ill-drawn contracts, and the like; of high qualifications and evident good intentions.That, in fact, was what struck one most—the excellence of their intentions.But as regards plague their competence was practically nil."
"只要一有机会，朗贝尔就会跟他们每个人打交道，陈述自己的理由。他的基本理由不外乎是：他是个外乡人，因此，他的情况应该特殊处理。多数时候对话者们都欣然接受这种观点。但是，通常他们接着会说还有很多人也是类似的情况，所以他的情况并不是他所想象的那样特殊。对于这一点，朗贝尔会回答说这丝毫不影响他的观点的实质内容。对方则说这确实会对本来就处境艰难的当局造成影响，他们反对给予任何特殊照顾，怕会造成一种非常令人反感的所谓“开了先例”。在和里厄医生谈话时，朗贝尔将他所接触过的这些人分成了好几类。他把前面所提到的那样说话的人称作顽固分子。此外，有些安抚人员，向他保证说目前的状况可能不会持久，而被要求提些具体的建议时，则搪塞着说他对这种暂时性的不便过于大惊小怪了。也有一些要人要求来访者留一张简要陈述情况的便条，并告诉说以后他们会作出决定；一些无聊之人给他提供军营许可证或是给他出租房的地址；一些官僚主义者让他填了表，立刻把表扔进了档案袋；一些忙不过来的官员，两手一抬了事；一些不耐烦的官员索性不理不睬；最后，还有一些沾有旧习气的人——这些人占了大部分——叫朗贝尔找另一个部门处理，或指点他另行接洽的方法。","However, whenever opportunity arose, Rambert had tackled each of them and pleaded his cause.The gist of his argument was always the same: that he was a stranger to our town and, that being so, his case deserved special consideration.Mostly the men he talked to conceded this point readily enough.But usually they added that a good number of other people were in a like case, and thus his position was not so exceptional as he seemed to suppose.To this Rambert could reply that this did not affect the substance of his argument in any way.He was then told that it did affect the position, already difficult, of the authorities, who were against showing any favoritism and thus running the risk of creating what, with obvious repugnance, they called “a precedent.”In conversation with Dr. Rieux, Rambert classified the people whom he had approached in various categories.Those who used the arguments mentioned above he called the sticklers.Besides these there were the consolers, who assured him that the present state of things couldn’t possibly last and, when asked for definite suggestions, fobbed him off by telling him he was making too much fuss about a passing inconvenience.Then there were the very important persons who asked the visitor to leave a brief note of his case and informed him they would decide on it in due course; the triflers, who offered him billeting warrants or gave the addresses of lodgings; the red-tape merchants, who made him fill up a form and promptly interred it in a file; overworked officials, who raised their arms to heaven, and much-harassed officials who simply looked away; and, finally, the traditionalists—these were by far the greatest number—who referred Rambert to another office or recommended some new method of approach."
"这些毫无成果的走访使这位记者感到筋疲力尽。但从好处说，通过在人造皮沙发上一坐就是几个小时，通过面对鼓励人们购买免税储蓄债券或参加殖民地远征军的海报，还通过走进办公室，看到那些就像他们身后的档案柜以及书架上布满灰尘的档案一样的面无表情的人们，他倒是很好地了解了市政府和省政府总部的内部运作。朗贝尔有点辛酸地对里厄说，这一切努力只换来一个结果，那就是让他不再去想自己的困境。事实上，他几乎感觉不到鼠疫的快速蔓延了。而且，这样日子也打发得更快些，而鉴于全城目前的局势，可以说每个人只要不死，每过一天，就离这场考验的终点近了二十四小时。里厄嘴巴上只能承认这种推理有道理，但他心里觉得这道理太过笼统了。","These fruitless interviews had thoroughly worn out the journalist; on the credit side he had obtained much insight into the inner workings of a municipal office and a Prefect’s headquarters, by dint of sitting for hours on imitation-leather sofas, confronted by posters urging him to invest in savings bonds exempt from income-tax, or to enlist in the colonial army; and by dint of entering offices where human faces were as blank as the filing cabinets and the dusty records on the shelves behind them.The only thing gained by all this expenditure of energy, Rambert told Rieux with a hint of bitterness, was that it served to keep his mind off his predicament.In fact, the rapid progress of the plague practically escaped his notice.Also, it made the days pass more quickly and, given the situation in which the whole town was placed, it might be said that every day lived through brought everyone, provided he survived, twenty-four hours nearer the end of his ordeal.Rieux could but admit the truth of this reasoning, but to his mind its truth was of rather too general an order."
"曾经有一次，朗贝尔看到了一丝希望。他接到省府发来的一份表格，要求他认真填写。表格内容包括他的身份、家庭情况、过去和现在的收入来源，事实上，他要填写的就是一份所谓的履历表。他感觉这些调查是为了拟出一份有可能被要求离城返乡的人员名单。从某个部门员工那里得到的一些含糊的消息也证实了这种感觉。但是经过进一步了解，最终找到寄出该表格的部门时，他却被告知说收集这些信息是为了以防不测。","At one moment Rambert had a gleam of hope.A form was sent him from the Prefect’s office with instructions that he was to fill in carefully all the blanks.It included questions concerning his identity, his family, his present and former sources of income; in fact, he was to give what is known as a curriculum vitae.He got an impression that inquiries were on foot with a view to drawing up a list of persons who might be instructed to leave the town and return to their homes.Some vague information gleaned from an employee in one of the offices confirmed this impression.But on going further into the matter and finally discovering the office from which the form had emanated, he was told that this information was being collected with a view to certain contingencies."
"“什么不测？”朗贝尔问。","“What contingencies?” he asked."
"然后他得知，“不测”指的是他有可能得了鼠疫而死亡。提供的这些信息便于当局通知他的家人，也便于当局决定是否由市政府来承担医疗费用，还是等他的亲属来付清费用。表面上看来，他与那位在家苦苦等候着他的心上人并没有完全隔离，因为当局还在关心着他们。但是，这并不能带来任何安慰。而真正值得注意、也是朗贝尔猛然意识到的是，在这样的大灾难中，一些部门继续沉着地运作着，并且主动地为将来的工作作些准备，不是按最高当局的指示，而是纯粹出于本职所在。 ","He then learned that the contingency was the possibility of his falling ill and dying of plague; the data supplied would enable the authorities to notify his family and also to decide if the hospital expenses should be borne by the municipality or if, in due course, they could be recovered from his relatives.On the face of it this implied that he was not completely cut off from the woman who was awaiting his return, since the powers that be were obviously giving heed to both of them.But that was no consolation.The really remarkable thing, and Rambert was greatly struck by this, was the way in which, in the very midst of catastrophe, offices could go on functioning serenely and take initiatives of no immediate relevance, and often unknown to the highest authority, purely and simply because they had been created originally for this purpose."
"接下来的这个时期对朗贝尔而言，是最容易过又是最难熬的。这是一个毫无生气的时期。他曾在不同的部门之间跑来跑去，任何方法都试过，却发现所有的那些方法现在对他来说都不奏效。所以，现在他漫无目的地在不同的咖啡馆之间游荡。早上，他会坐在某家咖啡馆的露台上看看报纸，希望找到些疫病正在逐渐消失的迹象。他会目不转睛地盯着行人的脸，一看到他们依然沮丧的表情就通常会厌恶地转过头去。他朝着街对面的店铺招牌和那些不再买得到的著名饮料的广告看了N遍之后就会站起身来，重新漫无目的地走在黄色的大街上。一直到黄昏，他都是这样打发时间的：他在城里走来走去，偶尔在咖啡馆或是饭馆停留一会儿。一天晚上，里厄看到朗贝尔正在一家咖啡馆门前徘徊，拿不定主意是否该进去。但最后他决定进去，然后在屋里靠后的一张桌子旁坐了下来。在这个时期，咖啡馆按照上面的命令尽量推迟开灯的时间。灰沉沉的暮色浸入室内，淡红色的夕阳照在墙镜上闪闪发光，而大理石桌面也在浓浓的暮色中发着微光。坐在空荡荡的咖啡馆里，朗贝尔形单影只，看起来非常悲哀与失落，而里厄猜想这应该是朗贝尔最能体会到被遗弃之感的时刻了。的确，就是在每天的这个时刻，这座城里所有被囚禁的人们都会体会到被遗弃之感，都在想着应该做些什么来早些得到解脱。于是，里厄匆忙转身离去。","The next phase was at once the easiest and the hardest for Rambert.It was a period of sheer lethargy.He had gone the round of-offices, taken every step that could be taken, and realized that for the present all avenues of that kind were closed to him.So now he drifted aimlessly from cafe to cafe.In the mornings he would sit on the terrace of one of them and read a newspaper in the hope of finding some indication that the epidemic was on the wane.He would gaze at the faces of the passers-by, often turning away disgustedly from their look of unrelieved gloom, and after reading for the nth time the shopsigns on the other side of the street, the advertisements of popular drinks that were no longer procurable, would rise and walk again at random in the yellow streets.Thus he killed time till nightfall, moving about the town and stopping now and then at a cafe or restaurant.One evening Rieux noticed him hovering round the door of a cafe, unable to make up his mind to enter.At last he decided to go in and sat down at a table at the back of the room.It was the time when, acting under orders, cafe-proprietors deferred as long as possible turning on their lights.Gray dusk was seeping into the room, the pink of sunset glowed in the wall mirrors, and the marble-topped tables glimmered white in the gathering darkness.Seated in the empty cafe, Rambert looked pathetically lost, a mere shade among the shadows, and Rieux guessed this was the hour when he felt most derelict.It was, indeed, the hour of day when all the prisoners of the town realized their dereliction and each was thinking that something, no matter what, must be done to hasten their deliverance.Rieux turned hurriedly away."
"朗贝尔也会在火车站呆上一段时间。月台是不准进人的。只是候车室可以从外面进去，而且仍然对外开放。因为这里阴凉，大热天常有乞丐光顾。朗贝尔花上很多时间来研究火车时刻表，看看有关吐痰的禁令和乘客须知。之后，他在一个角落处坐下来。一个旧生铁火炉，几个月来一直冰冷如石，如同地标一般高高地耸立在候车室中央，四周地上满是过去洒成8字型的水渍。墙上张贴着的海报还在热情地邀请游客前往戛纳或邦多勒享受无忧无虑的假期。朗贝尔在角落里痛苦地品味着绝境中自由的感觉。那时他感到最伤感的是——至少他对里厄是这样说的——这唤起了他对巴黎的回忆。逐一展现在他眼前的是古石、河堤、皇宫的鸽子、北火车站、先贤祠四周幽静的古街以及过去他从未意识到自己如此深爱着的那座城市中的许多其他去处,而脑海里的这些画面使他提不起兴趣去做任何事情。里厄确信朗贝尔是把这些景象与他对心上人的回忆联系在一起了。有一天，朗贝尔告诉医生，他喜欢在凌晨四点钟醒来思念他所热爱的巴黎，医生凭借自身经验不难猜测，那其实是朗贝尔想起他那位不在身边的心上人的最佳时刻。事实上，只有在这个时刻，他才能确切地感觉到她是完完全全属于自己的。人们在凌晨四点之前几乎不做什么事情，在那个时刻，人们都在睡觉，即使是在一个背叛爱人的激情之夜过后。的确，这个时候每个人都在睡觉，这使人安心，因为一颗不安的心强烈地渴望永远在意识中占有他的心上人，即使她不在身边，也渴望能使她进入一场无梦的酣睡中，直到他们团聚之日才醒来。","Rambert also spent a certain amount of time at the railroad station.No one was allowed on the platforms.But the waiting-rooms, which could be entered from outside, remained open and, being cool and dark, were often patronized by beggars on very hot days.Rambert spent much time studying the timetables, reading the prohibitions against spitting, and the passengers’ regulations.After that he sat down in a corner.An old cast-iron stove, which had been stone-cold for months, rose like a sort of landmark in the middle of the room, surrounded by figure-of-eight patterns on the floor, the traceries of long-past sprinklings.Posters on the walls gaily invited tourists to a carefree holiday at Cannes or Bandol.And in his corner Rambert savored that bitter sense of freedom which comes of total deprivation.The evocations which at that time he found most poignant were—anyhow according to what he told Rieux—those of Paris.There rose before his eyes, unsummoned, vistas of old stones and riverbanks, the pigeons of the Palais-Royal, the Gare du Nord, quiet old streets round the Pantheon, and many another scene of the city he’d never known he loved so much, and these mental pictures killed all desire for any form of action.Rieux felt fairly sure he was identifying these scenes with memories of his love.And when one day Rambert told him that he liked waking up at four in the morning and thinking of his beloved Paris, the doctor guessed easily enough, basing this on his own experience, that that was his favorite time for conjuring up pictures of the woman from whom he now was parted.This was, indeed, the hour when he could feel surest she was wholly his.Till four in the morning one is seldom doing anything and at that hour, even if the night has been a night of betrayal, one is asleep.Yes, everyone sleeps at that hour, and this is reassuring, since the great longing of an unquiet heart is to possess constantly and consciously the loved one, or, failing that, to be able to plunge the loved one, when a time of absence intervenes, into a dreamless sleep timed to last unbroken until the day they meet again."
"第十三章","Chapter 13"
"帕纳卢神父布道后不久，天气猛然热了起来。在那个周日下过一场不合时令的大雨之后第二天，炎炎夏日开始在城市上空大显淫威。先是强烈的热风刮了一整天，把墙壁都吹干了。接着太阳又上阵了，一整天持续的热浪和骄阳席卷全城，除了拱廊街道和室内，到处都暴露在耀眼的阳光下。太阳紧盯着那些沿着小路或是墙脚前行的市民们。他们一停下来，太阳就使劲晒。","Shortly after Father Paneloux’s sermon the hot weather set in with a vengeance.On the day following the unseasonable downpour of that Sunday, summer blazed out above the housetops.First a strong, scorching wind blew steadily for a whole day, drying up the walls.And then the sun took charge, incessant waves of heat and light swept the town daylong, and but for arcaded streets and the interiors of houses, everything lay naked to the dazzling impact of the light.The sun stalked our townsfolk along every byway, into every nook; and when they paused, it struck."
"由于这夏日的首次热浪来袭与死亡人数惊人增长同时出现——现在每周大约有七百人死亡——全城都沉浸在一种极度沮丧的情绪之中。在郊区，平坦的大街与带有露台的房子之间往日的生气几乎不复存在。居住在这里的人们过去常常坐在门口的阶梯上享受美好的时光，而现在所有的房门都关上了，看不见一个人，甚至连威尼斯风格的百叶窗也合上了，也不知道人们是为了抵挡热气还是抵御鼠疫。一些屋子里传出阵阵呻吟声。起初，碰到这种情况，人们往往会在好奇心或是同情心的驱使下驻足倾听。但是，承受了长时间的痛苦之后，现在人们的心肠似乎也变硬了。伴着呻吟声，人们继续生活或行走着，就好像它们是人们习以为常的一种语言。","Since this first onslaught of the heat synchronized with a startling increase in the number of victims—there were now nearly seven hundred deaths a week—a mood of profound discouragement settled on the town.In the suburbs little was left of the wonted animation between the long flat streets and the terraced houses; ordinarily people living in these districts used to spend the best part of the day on their doorsteps, but now every door was shut, nobody was to be seen, even the Venetian blinds stayed down, and there was no knowing if it was the heat or the plague that they were trying to shut out.In some houses groans could be heard.At first, when that happened, people often gathered outside and listened, prompted by curiosity or compassion.But under the prolonged strain it seemed that hearts had toughened; people lived beside those groans or walked past them as though they had become the normal speech of men."
"在城门口发生的冲突中警察不得不使用手枪，结果，一种无法无天的情绪滋长了起来。在与警察的冲突中确实有人受了伤，但城里还传说有人丧了命，因为在炎热与恐惧的双重影响之下，任何事情都会被夸大。不管怎样，有件事情倒是确定无疑的：不满情绪日益增长，唯恐事态恶化，地方官员们长时间地讨论着万一那些因疫病而变得极度疯狂的市民们完全失去了控制，到底该采取些什么措施。报纸上公布了新的规定，重申不准出城的禁令，并警告说违令者要受到长期监禁的惩处。城里开始实行巡逻制度，在闷热的、空荡荡的大街上，往往先响起踩在鹅卵石路面上的马蹄声，然后才见到骑马的警察分队在两排紧闭着的窗户之间行进。时不时可以听到枪声。最近选派的一支特别小分队正在忙着射杀可能是病原携带者的猫和狗。而这打破寂静的短促枪声加剧了城里原有的紧张气氛。","As a result of the fighting at the gates, in the course of which the police had had to use their revolvers, a spirit of lawlessness was abroad.Some had certainly been wounded in these brushes with the police, but in the town, where, owing to the combined influences of heat and terror, everything was exaggerated, there was talk of deaths.One thing, anyhow, was certain; discontent was on the increase and, fearing worse to come, the local officials debated lengthily on the measures to be taken if the populace, goaded to frenzy by the epidemic, got completely out of hand.The newspapers published new regulations reiterating the orders against attempting to leave the town and warning those who infringed them that they were liable to long terms of imprisonment.A system of patrols was instituted and often in the empty, sweltering streets, heralded by a clatter of horse hoofs on the cobbles, a detachment of mounted police would make its way between the parallel lines of closeshut windows.Now and again a gunshot was heard; the special brigade recently detailed to destroy cats and dogs, as possible carriers of infection, was at work.And these whipcrack sounds startling the silence increased the nervous tension already existing in the town."
"因为在炎热和寂静之中，对内心饱受折磨的市民们来说，任何事情，即使是一点点声响，都变得特别引人注意。天空变换的颜色和泥土的气味显示着气候的变化，这时也头一次受到关注。大家沮丧地意识到炎热的天气将会助长瘟疫，而现在夏天显然已经来临。夜晚的空气里，屋顶上传来的雨燕的鸣叫声变得越来越刺耳。天空在六月的暮色里通常显得无边无际，而现在却已不再宽广。市场上见不到含苞待放的鲜花了，花儿都早已盛开，早市过后，遍地灰尘的人行道上满是遭人践踏过的花瓣。人们清楚地看到春天已经逝去，曾经花枝招展、姹紫嫣红的春天现在已在炎热和鼠疫的双重夹击下渐渐枯萎。在市民同胞们看来，这夏日的天空，以及像现在的生活一样苍白而布满灰尘的街道，同每天压在人们心头的成百人死亡的数字一样，都是一种不祥的预兆。一刻也不停歇的日晒以及引人思睡或者度假的美好时刻不再像往日那样吸引人们到海滩上调情嬉戏。现在，在这座被封锁的城市里一片寂静，人们只感到一阵空虚，快乐夏日的黄金时期已不复存在。鼠疫抹杀了一切色彩，赶走了一切欢乐。","For in the heat and stillness, and for the troubled hearts of our townsfolk, anything, even the least sound, had a heightened significance.The varying aspects of the sky, the very smells rising from the soil that mark each change of season, were taken notice of for the first time.Everyone realized with dismay that hot weather would favor the epidemic, and it was clear that summer was setting in.The cries of swifts in the evening air above the housetops were growing shriller.And the sky, too, had lost the spaciousness of those June twilights when our horizons seem infinitely remote.In the markets the flowers no longer came in buds; they were already in full bloom, and after the morning’s marketing the dusty pavements were littered with trampled petals.It was plain to see that spring had spent itself, lavished its ardor on the myriads of flowers that were bursting everywhere into bloom, and now was being crushed out by the twofold onslaught of heat and plague.For our fellow citizens that summer sky, and the streets thick in dust, gray as their present lives, had the same ominous import as the hundred deaths now weighing daily on the town.That incessant sunlight and those bright hours associated with siesta or with holidays no longer invited, as in the past, to frolics and flirtation on the beaches.Now they rang hollow in the silence of the closed town, they had lost the golden spell of happier summers.Plague had killed all colors, vetoed pleasure."
"这的确是疫病带来的一种重大变化。以前，所有人都是满怀愉悦和期待迎接夏日的到来。全城向大海敞开着大门，年轻人在海滩上自由嬉戏。而这个夏天，城市附近的所有海滨都禁止入内，年轻人也就不再有享乐的权利了。在这种状况下人们能做什么呢？还是塔鲁再次最为真实地记录了我们当时的生活。不用说，他概述了鼠疫的进展状况，他也注意到，当电台报告的不再是每周死亡总数，而是每天死亡92人，107人，甚至是130人时，疫病已进入了一个新的阶段。“报纸和当局携起手来共同面对鼠疫。他们认为自己正在削弱鼠疫带来的恐惧感，因为130人的数字要比910人更小些。”他也记录了他亲眼所见的鼠疫中的一些触目惊心的事情。例如，在一条冷冷清清的大街上，他抬头看见一个女人突然打开一扇窗，大声尖叫了两声后，重新合上百叶窗以遮挡住她那昏暗的卧室内部。而他还注意到药房里的薄荷宝塔糖已销售一空，因为人们普遍认为含着这种药糖可以预防疫病传染。","That, indeed, was one of the great changes brought by the epidemic.Hitherto all of us welcomed summer in with pleasant anticipation.The town was open to the sea and its young folk made free of the beaches.But this summer, for all its nearness, the sea was out of bounds; young limbs had no longer the run of its delights.What could we do under these conditions?It is Tarrou once again who paints the most faithful picture of our life in those days.Needless to say, he outlines the progress of the plague and he, too, notes that a new phase of the epidemic was ushered in when the radio announced no longer weekly totals, but ninety-two, a hundred and seven, and a hundred and thirty deaths in a day.“The newspapers and the authorities are playing ball with the plague.They fancy they’re scoring off it because a hundred and thirty is a smaller figure than nine hundred and ten.”He also records such striking or moving incidents of the epidemic as came under his notice; that, for instance, of the woman in a lonely street who abruptly opened a shuttered window just above his head and gave two loud shrieks before closing the shutters again on the dark interior of a bedroom.But he also noted that peppermint lozenges had vanished from the drugstores, because there was a popular belief that when sucking them you were proof against contagion."
"他继续观察着他对面阳台上那个喜欢宠物的怪老头。看来悲剧也降临到这个喜欢捉弄猫的老头身上。一天早晨，街上传来几下枪声，正如塔鲁所写的那样，“几颗铅弹”打死了大部分猫，其余的猫也被吓跑了，反正街道上从此再没有猫的踪迹。当天，矮老头在惯常的时刻又出现在阳台上，他显得有点惊讶，靠着栏杆朝街角认真扫视了一番。然后，他坐下来等候，焦躁不安地用右手轻轻敲打着栏杆。等了一段时间之后，他撕了些小纸片，返身进屋之后又走了出来。又等了较长一段时间之后，他再次进了屋，猛然关上了身后的落地窗。那一周，他每天都重复做着同样的事，而随着时间的流逝，他看起来变得越来越悲伤，越来越困惑。到了第八天，塔鲁白白等了一天也没见老头露面。窗户依然紧闭着，不难理解关在里面的人有多痛苦。这段记录之后塔鲁作了总结：“鼠疫期间不准朝猫儿吐唾沫。”","He went on watching his pet specimen on the opposite balcony.It seemed that tragedy had come to the ancient small-game hunter as well.One morning there had been gunshots in the street and, as Tarrou put it, “some gobs of lead” had killed off most of the cats and scared away the others; anyhow they were no longer about.That day the little old man went on to his balcony at the usual hour, showed some surprise, and, leaning on the rail, closely scanned the corners of the street.Then he settled down to wait, fretfully tapping the balustrade with his right hand.After staying there for some time he tore up a few sheets of paper, went back into his room, and came out again.After another longish wait he retreated again into the room, slamming the french windows behind him.He followed the same procedure daily during the rest of the week, and the sadness and bewilderment on the old face deepened as the days went by.On the eighth day Tarrou waited in vain for his appearance; the windows stayed resolutely closed on all too comprehensible distress.This entry ends with Tarrou’s summing up.“It is forbidden to spit on cats in plague-time.”"
"在另一段文字中，塔鲁记录着：当他晚上回去时，他总能见到那位守夜人如同警卫巡逻一般，在大厅里踱来踱去。这位老人遇到每一个人都不忘提醒说他早已预见到现在发生的事情。塔鲁承认老人确实曾经预言会有一场灾难，但塔鲁提醒他当初他预言的是要发生一场地震。对此，老人回答说：“啊，要是这是一场地震就好了！剧烈地摇上好一阵，事情就是这样啦！然后清点一下多少人死了，多少人活着，一切也就结束了。但这是一场该死的鼠疫——就是没有患病的人也不能不时刻想着这事。”","In another context Tarrou notes that, on coming home in the evenings, he invariably saw the night watchman pacing the hall, like a sentry on his beat.The man never failed to remind everyone he met that he’d foreseen what was happening.Tarrou agreed that he’d predicted a disaster, but reminded him that the event predicted by him was an earthquake.To which the old fellow replied: “Ah, if only it had been an earthquake!A good bad shock, and there you are!You count the dead and living, and that’s an end of it.But this here damned disease—even them who haven’t got it can’t think of anything else.”"
"旅馆经理同样也很沮丧。封城初期，旅客们因为不能出城而继续住在旅馆里。但是，看到疫情丝毫没有减弱的迹象，旅客们就一个接一个地搬到朋友家去住了。鼠疫曾经使得旅馆客房爆满，而现在同样的原因却导致许多客房都空着，因为再也没有新的游客到城里来了。塔鲁是留下来的少数几个房客之一，而经理总会不失时机地对塔鲁说，要不是他不愿意给这些房客造成不便，他的旅馆早就关门歇业了。他经常要塔鲁估计瘟疫还会持续多长时间。“据说，”塔鲁告诉他说，“寒冷的天气会消灭这类疫病。”经理看起来被吓坏了。“但是，先生，这地方从来就没有真正冷过。那么，这就是说瘟疫无论如何都还要持续数月了。”此外，他还肯定地说，在未来很长一段时间，游客们都不会来这座城市了。实际上，这场瘟疫摧毁了旅游业。","The manager of the hotel was equally downhearted.In the early days travelers, unable to leave the town, had kept on their rooms.But one by one, seeing that the epidemic showed no sign of abating, they moved out to stay with friends.And the same cause that had led to all the rooms’ being occupied now kept them empty, since there were no newcomers to the town.Tarrou was one of the very few remaining guests, and the manager never lost an opportunity of informing him that, were he not reluctant to put these gentlemen to inconvenience, he would have closed the hotel long ago.He often asked Tarrou to say how long he thought the epidemic would last.“They say,” Tarrou informed him, “that cold weather stamps out diseases of this type.”The manager looked aghast.“But, my dear sir, it’s never really cold in these parts.And, anyhow, that would mean it’s going to last many months more.”Moreover, he was sure that for a long while to come travelers would give the town a wide berth.This epidemic spelt the ruin of the tourist trade, in fact."
"有一小段时间暂未露面的奥顿先生，那位猫头鹰似的一家之长，又出现在饭馆里了，但跟着他的只有“上台表演的两只小狗”，他的两个孩子。一打听才知道奥顿太太正处于隔离检疫期。她曾照料过她那位死于鼠疫的母亲。","After a short absence M. Othon, the owlish paterfamilias, made a reappearance in the restaurant, but accompanied only by the two “performing poodles,” his offspring.On inquiry it came out that Mme Othon was in quarantine; she had been nursing her mother, who had succumbed to plague."
"“我一点儿也不喜欢这种做法，”经理说，“不管是否被隔离，她都值得怀疑，也就是说她的家人也是如此。”","“I don’t like it a bit,” the manager told Tarrou.“Quarantine or not, she’s under suspicion, which means that they are, too.”"
"塔鲁告诉他，要是这样的话，每个人都“值得怀疑”。但经理却坚持自己的观点，丝毫也不会动摇。","Tarrou pointed out that, if it came to that, everyone was “under suspicion.”But the manager had his own ideas and was not to be shaken out of them."
"“不，先生。你和我都不可疑。但他们理所当然值得怀疑。”","“No, sir.You and I, we’re not under suspicion.But they certainly are.”"
"但是，奥顿先生丝毫不受影响，也不会因为鼠疫而改变他的习惯。他以惯常的高贵姿态走进饭馆，比他的孩子们先一步坐下，不时地对他们说些高雅但不亲切的话语。只有那位小男孩看起来有些变化，他像姐姐一样穿着黑衣服，比以前瘦小了些，就像是他父亲的缩微版。守夜人不喜欢奥顿先生，他对塔鲁说：","However, M. Othon was impervious to such considerations and would not let the plague change his habits.He entered the restaurant with his wonted dignity, sat down in front of his children, and addressed to them at intervals the same nicely worded, unamiable remarks.Only the small boy looked somewhat different; dressed in black like his sister, a little more shrunken than before, he now seemed a miniature replica of his father.The night watchman, who had no liking for M. Othon, had said of him to Tarrou: "
"“那位优雅的绅士将会衣着整齐地死去。一切都穿戴好了，随时都可以走了。因而他也不需要再作些什么安排了。”","“That fine gentleman will pass out with his clothes on.All dressed up and ready to go.So he won’t need no laying-out.”"
"塔鲁对帕纳卢的布道也评论了一番：“我能理解这种热情，也觉得它并不讨厌。在灾难开始和结束的时候，人们总是习惯于说些华而不实的话。在第一种情况下，习惯尚未改变；在第二种情况下，习惯又恢复过来了。只有身陷深重灾难之中，人们才会习惯于现实——或者说，习惯于沉默。所以，我们就等着瞧吧。”","Tarrou has some comments on the sermon preached by Paneloux: “I can understand that type of fervor and find it not displeasing.At the beginning of a pestilence and when it ends, there’s always a propensity for rhetoric.In the first case, habits have not yet been lost; in the second, they’re returning.It is in the thick of a calamity that one gets hardened to the truth—in other words, to silence.So let’s wait.”"
"塔鲁还记录了他与里厄医生之间的一次长谈，他只记得那次谈话“很有成效”。他顺便提到里厄老太太，医生的母亲，有着一双明亮的枣骝的眼睛，还奇怪地评论说她那饱含善意的眼神总会战胜鼠疫。","Tarrou also records that he had a long talk with Dr. Rieux; all he remembered was that it had “good results.”In this connection he notes the color of Mme Rieux’s, the doctor’s mother’s, eyes, a limpid brown, and makes the odd observation that a gaze revealing so much goodness of heart would always triumph over plague."
"他还详细记录了里厄医生的气喘病患者的情况。他和医生结束谈话后，紧接着就一起去看这个病人。老人笑着与塔鲁打过招呼，开心地搓着手。他坐在床上，面前仍然放着两个盛满干豆的锅。“啊，又来了一个！”他一看到塔鲁就惊叫起来，“这真是个颠倒的世界，医生比病人还多。因为鼠疫正在夺走他们的生命，不是吗，越来越多。神父说得对，我们是罪有应得。”第二天，塔鲁事先没打招呼又去看望了老人。","He has also a good deal to say about Rieux’s asthma patient.He went with the doctor to see him, immediately after their conversation.The old man greeted Tarrou with a chuckle and rubbed his hands cheerfully.He was sitting up in bed with the usual two pans of dried peas in front of him.“Ah, here’s another of ’em!” he exclaimed when he saw Tarrou.“It’s a topsy-turvy world all right, more doctors than patients.Because it’s mowing them down, ain’t it, more and more.That priest’s right; we were asking for it.”Next day Tarrou came to see him without warning."
"从塔鲁的笔记中可以得知，老人本来经营纺织品生意，到了五十岁时决定这辈子也该歇歇了。他开始喜欢呆在床上，并且从此再也没有离开过他的床——倒不是因为他的气喘病，他的病本不影响他四处走动。他靠着一小笔年金活到七十五岁，而且活得很开心。他看到手表就不舒服，而整个屋子里确实没有任何一只手表。“手表，”他说，“这东西既愚蠢又昂贵。”他自己计算时间——也就是吃饭的时间——靠的是他那两个锅，其中一个在他早上醒来时总是盛满了干豆。他不断地用非常均匀的速度将干豆一粒接一粒地放入另一个锅。这样，时间对他而言是用这两个锅来计算的，而且他对一天当中的任何时间都可以作出判断。“每十五锅，”他说，“就该吃饭了。还有什么方法比这更简单的呢？”","From Tarrou’s notes we gather that the old man, a dry-goods dealer by occupation, decided at the age of fifty that he’d done enough work for a lifetime.He took to his bed and never left it again-but not because of his asthma, which would not have prevented his getting about.A small fixed income had seen him through to his present age, seventyfive, and the years had not damped his cheerfulness.He couldn’t bear the sight of a watch, and indeed there wasn’t one in the whole house.“Watches,” he said, “are silly gadgets, and dear at that.”He worked out the time—that is to say, the time for meals—with his two saucepans, one of which was always full of peas when he woke in the morning.He filled the other, pea by pea, at a constant, carefully regulated speed.Thus time for him was reckoned by these pans and he could take his bearings in it at any moment of the day.“Every fifteen pans,” he said, “it’s feeding-time.What could be simpler?”"
"据他妻子说，他在年轻时就表现出他将来生活方式的一些征兆。事实上，那时他对任何事情都没兴趣。工作、朋友、咖啡馆、音乐、女人、出游——这一切他都不感兴趣。他从未离开过他的家乡，只有一次因为家庭事务不得不到阿尔及尔去，而即使那次，他也在离奥兰最近的一个车站就下车了，不愿继续他的旅程。随后，他乘坐最早的一趟火车回家了。","If his wife was to be trusted, he had given signs of his vocation at a very early age.Nothing, in fact, had ever interested him; his work, friendship, cafes, music, women, outings—to all he was indifferent.He had never left his home town except once when he had been called to Algiers for family affairs, and even then he had alighted from the train at the first station after Oran, incapable of continuing the adventure.He took the first train back."
"塔鲁对他这种离群索居的生活感到惊讶，而老人对此多少作了些解释。根据宗教的说法，人的上半生是走上坡路，下半生是走下坡路。对走下坡路的日子，他是没有提出要求的权利的，这些日子随时可能被夺走。他对此无能为力，因此最好的办法恰恰就是什么也不做。他显然不在乎说话前后矛盾，因为不久之后他又对塔鲁说，上帝并不存在，否则神父们就没有用处了。但是，听了老人接下来的一番评论之后，塔鲁终于明白，他的这种哲理与区里总是频繁向各家各户募捐慈善基金而引起他的不满是紧密相关的。对于这位老人的最后描述似乎意味深长，那也是老人多次提到的一个愿望：希望死得越晚越好。","To Tarrou, who had shown surprise at the secluded life he led, he had given the following explanation, more or less.According to religion, the first half of a man’s life is an upgrade; the second goes downhill.On the descending days he has no claim, they may be snatched from him at any moment; thus he can do nothing with them and the best thing, precisely, is to do nothing with them.He obviously had no compunction about contradicting himself, for a few minutes later he told Tarrou that God did not exist, since otherwise there would be no need for priests.But, from some observations which followed, Tarrou realized that the old fellow’s philosophy was closely involved with the irritation caused by the house-to-house collections in aid of charities, which took place almost incessantly in that part of the town.What completed the picture of the old man was a desire he expressed several times, and which seemed deeply rooted: the desire to die at a very advanced age."
"“他是个圣人吗？”塔鲁自问自答说，“是的，假如圣德是全部习惯的总和。”","“Is he a saint?” Tarrou asked himself, and answered: “Yes, if saintliness is an aggregate of habits.”"
"同时，塔鲁较为详尽地描述了这座鼠疫之城的一天，这可以全面而准确地展现那个夏天我们市民的生活画面。“没有一个人在笑，”塔鲁说道，“醉汉除外，他们又笑得太过分了。”接着，他开始进行详细描述。“黎明时分，阵阵微风轻拂着仍然空荡荡的大街。在这个时刻，这个死神肆虐的黑夜与垂死呻吟的白昼进行交替的时刻，鼠疫似乎停歇了一会儿，好喘上一口气。所有的商店都关着门。但有几家店门上贴着通知：因鼠疫而歇业，这表明其他店开门营业时，这些店是不会开门了。卖报的半睡半醒，还没有开始叫喊当天的新闻，而是懒洋洋地倚在街角，梦游般茫然地挥挥手，像是在向路灯兜售他们的报纸。不一会儿，他们被早班电车吵醒，奔向全城各处，伸长胳臂挥舞着的报纸上赫然印着‘鼠疫’的字样。会有一个鼠疫肆虐的秋天吗？B教授回答说：‘不会。’鼠疫第九十四天的死亡人数：124人。","Meanwhile Tarrou was compiling a longish description of a day in the plague-stricken town; it was to give a full and accurate picture of the life of our fellow citizens during that summer.“Nobody laughs,” Tarrou observes, “except the drunks, and they laugh too much.”After which he embarks on his description.“At daybreak light breaths of air fan the still empty streets.At this hour, between the night’s victims and the death-agonies of the coming day, it is as if for a while plague stays its hand and takes breath.All shops are shut.But on some a notice: Closed owing to plague, shows that when the others open presently, these will not.Still half-asleep, the newsboys do not yet cry the news but, lounging at street corners, offer their wares to the lamp-posts, with the vague gestures of sleepwalkers.Soon, awakened by the early streetcars, they will fan out through the town, holding at arm’s length sheets on which the word PLAGUE looms large.Will there be a plague autumn?Professor B says: ‘No.’ Toll of the 94th day of plague: 124 deaths."
"“尽管纸张越来越紧缺，有些日报被迫减少版面，但有份新报纸《鼠疫通讯》已经开始发行，提出的宗旨是‘充分客观地向市民报道每天疫情的发展或减退情况；向他们提供关于疫情未来发展的权威观点；为来自各行各业有志于加入到与瘟疫作斗争的队伍中来的所有人开辟讨论专栏；振作人们的精神状态；传达当局颁布的最新法令；汇集所有有志之士为应对目前的紧急状况提供全心全意的帮助。’而事实上，这家报纸很快开始开辟专栏来刊登一些对治疗鼠疫‘绝对有效’的新产品的广告。早上将近六点钟时，所有的报纸都卖给那些在商店开门前一个多小时便在店门口排长队等候的人们，然后又卖给那些从郊区赶过来的、从挤得满满当当的电车上下来的乘客们。电车是现在唯一的交通工具，车上的踏脚板上和栏杆旁都挤满了人，行驶十分艰难。奇怪的是，乘客们都怪怪地扭转着身子，尽量背对着他人——这样做当然是为了避免传染。每到一站，男女乘客们一拥而下，各自赶紧与其余人保持上一段安全的距离。","“In spite of the growing shortage of paper, which has compelled some dailies to reduce their pages, a new paper has been launched: the Plague Chronicle, which sets out ‘to inform our townspeople, with scrupulous veracity, of the daily progress or recession of the disease; to supply them with the most authoritative opinions available as to its future course; to offer the hospitality of its columns to all, in whatever walk of life, who wish to join in combating the epidemic; to keep up the morale of the populace; to publish the latest orders issued by the authorities; and to centralize the efforts of all who desire to give active and wholehearted help in the present emergency.’Actually this newspaper very soon came to devote its columns to advertisements of new, ‘infallible’ antidotes against plague.Toward six in the morning all these papers are being sold to the lines that begin to form outside the shops over an hour before they open; then to the passengers alighting from the streetcars coming in, packed to capacity, from the suburbs.The cars are now the only means of transport, and they have much difficulty in progressing, what with people standing on the running-boards and hanging in clusters from the handrails.A queer thing is how the passengers all try to keep their backs turned to their neighbors, twisting themselves into grotesque attitudes in the attempt—the idea being, of course, to avoid contagion.At every stop a cataract of men and women is disgorged, each in haste to put a safe distance between himself or herself and the rest."
"“头班电车开过后，城市渐渐苏醒过来，首先是几家咖啡馆开门了，柜台上摆了一排牌子：‘无咖啡供应’、‘请自备白糖’等等。接着商店也开门了，街上也变得热闹起来。与此同时，天越来越亮了，尽管时候还早，天空随着温度的升高，已经开始呈现出一种铅灰色。这正是那些无所事事的人在街头游荡的时候。他们当中的大多数人似乎已经决定用一种穷奢极欲的方式来对抗鼠疫。每天十一点左右，有一些年轻男女在街上招摇过市，激起了身处大难之中的人们心底那种强烈的生活欲望。如果瘟疫蔓延开来，道德观念就会逐渐淡薄，而我们可能又会看到像古罗马时代米兰城中男男女女在坟墓边尽情舞蹈、喧闹狂欢那样的情景。","“When the first cars have gone by, the town gradually wakes up, early cafes open their doors, and you see an array of cards on the counter: No Coffee, Bring Your Own Sugar, and the like.Next the shops open and the streets grow livelier.And meanwhile the light is swelling and the sky, even at this early hour, beginning to grow leaden-hued with heat.This is the time when those who have nothing to do venture out on the boulevards.Most of them seem determined to counteract the plague by a lavish display of luxury.Daily, about eleven, you see a sort of dress parade of youths and girls, who make you realize the frantic desire for life that thrives in the heart of every great calamity.If the epidemic spreads, morals too will broaden, and we may see again the saturnalia of Milan, men and women dancing round the graves."
"“中午，所有的饭馆瞬间都客满了。一会儿工夫，没有找到座位的人们已三五成群地聚在饭馆门口。因为天气太热，天空也显得不那么亮了。大遮阳蓬在街道旁一字排开，被正午的太阳晒得咝咝作响，伞下坐着那些等着空位吃饭的人们。饭馆之所以这样拥挤，是因为它们解决了许多人的吃饭问题。但它们丝毫不能减轻人们对瘟疫传染的恐惧。许多顾客会花好几分钟的时间有条不紊地擦拭餐盘。有些饭馆在不久前张贴了这样的通告：‘本馆餐具已消毒’。但渐渐地饭馆也不再做这样的宣传，因为顾客无论如何都会来。而且，人们花钱也很大方。上等酒或号称上等酒的饮料、价钱最贵的上品——饭馆里弥漫着一种放纵挥霍的氛围。有一家饭馆似乎也出现过惊慌失措的场面，因为有位顾客突然感觉不适，脸色发白地踉跄着匆忙走出去了。","“At noon, in a flash, all the restaurants fill up.Very quickly small groups of people unable to find a seat form at the doors.Because of the intense heat the sky is losing its brightness.Under big awnings the aspirants to food wait their turn, aligned along the curbs of streets gaping and sizzling in the fires of noon.The reason for the restaurants’ being so crowded is that they solve for many the feeding problem.But they do nothing to allay the fear of contagion.Many of the customers spend several minutes methodically wiping their plates.Not long ago some restaurants put up notices: Our plates, knives, and forks guaranteed sterilized.But gradually they discontinued publicity of this order, since their customers came in any case.People, moreover, spend very freely.Choice wines, or wines alleged to be such, the costliest extras—a mood of reckless extravagance is setting in.It seems that there was something like a panic in a restaurant because a customer suddenly felt ill, went very white, and staggered precipitately to the door."
"“将近两点时，城里渐渐变得空荡荡起来，这是安静、阳光、尘埃和鼠疫独自拥有街道的时刻。在这段漫长的无精打采的时间里，热浪一阵接一阵地向街道上的一幢幢灰色大房子袭来。下午就这样沉闷地慢慢过去了，夜晚渐渐降临，夜色就像一个红色的裹尸布笼罩着全城的拥挤和喧嚣。天气刚刚转热时，不知是何缘故，晚上大街上几乎见不到人。但现在这夜晚的一丝凉意给人们带来的即使不是一线希望，也是一种轻松。于是，大家涌到户外，尽情交谈，互相争吵，或者调情嬉戏，而在落日余辉的映照下，整座城市就像一艘无人掌舵的小船，载着一对对情侣和他们的欢声笑语，缓缓驶入茫茫夜色之中。一位戴着毡帽、打着大领结的热心的布道者突然地穿梭于人群之中，不停地大喊：‘天主是伟大的。皈依他吧。’而与之相反，大家都忙着做些似乎比皈依天主更为有趣的琐碎的事情。一开始，大家以为这场瘟疫不过是一般的疫病，宗教还能保持它的地位。而他们一旦意识到情况非常严重，就想到寻欢作乐上来了。白天刻在他们脸上的恐惧，一到热气腾腾、尘土飞扬的的黄昏就转变为一种极度兴奋，一种令他们热血沸腾的放纵的自由。","“Toward two o’clock the town slowly empties, it is the time when silence, sunlight, dust, and plague have the streets to themselves.Wave after wave of heat flows over the frontage of the tall gray houses during these long, languid hours.Thus the afternoon wears on, slowly merging into an evening that settles down like a red winding-sheet on the serried tumult of the town.At the start of the great heat, for some unascertained reason, the evenings found the streets almost empty.But now the least ripple of cooler air brings an easing of the strain, if not a flutter of hope.Then all stream out into the open, drug themselves with talking, start arguing or lovemaking, and in the last glow of sunset the town, freighted with lovers two by two and loud with voices, drifts like a helmless ship into the throbbing darkness.In vain a zealous evangelist with a felt hat and flowing tie threads his way through the crowd, crying without cease: ‘God is great and good.Come unto Him.’On the contrary, they all make haste toward some trivial objective that seems of more immediate interest than God.In the early days, when they thought this epidemic was much like other epidemics, religion held its ground.But once these people realized their instant peril, they gave their thoughts to pleasure.And all the hideous fears that stamp their faces in the daytime are transformed in the fiery, dusty nightfall into a sort of hectic exaltation, an unkempt freedom fevering their blood."
"“而我，也与他们一样。那有什么要紧的？死亡对于我这样的人来说算不了什么。这证明了人们的做法是有道理的。”","“And I, too, I’m no different.But what matter?Death means nothing to men like me.It’s the event that proves them right.”"
"第十四章","Chapter 14"
"塔鲁笔记中提到的他与里厄的那次会面是塔鲁要求的。那天晚上，塔鲁还没到，里厄凝视着他的母亲已有好一会儿了，她正在饭厅一角安静地坐着。一做完家务活,她就坐在那张椅子上打发时间。她双手合放在膝盖上，坐在那里等待着。里厄甚至不能肯定她是否在等他。但是，每次只要他走过去，他母亲脸上的表情总会有所变化。操劳的生活使她的脸上带着安静顺从的表情，这时似乎瞬间容光焕发起来。过了一会儿，她又重新静默下来。那天晚上，她凝视着窗外那空荡荡的大街。路灯已减少了三分之二，间隔很远才有一盏路灯透过城市的浓浓夜幕发出摇曳的灯光。","It was Tarrou who had asked Rieux for the interview he refers to in his diary.On that evening, as it happened, just before Tarrou arrived, the doctor had gazed for some moments at his mother, who was sitting very still in a corner of the dining-room.Once her household tasks were over, she spent most of her time in that chair.Her hands folded in her lap, she sat there waiting.Rieux wasn’t even sure it was for him she waited.However, something always changed in his mother’s face when he came in.The silent resignation that a laborious life had given it seemed to light up with a sudden glow.Then she returned to her tranquillity.That evening she was gazing out of the window at the now empty street.The street lighting had been reduced by two thirds, and only at long intervals a lamp cast flickering gleams through the thick darkness of the town."
"“鼠疫不结束，路灯照明就一直要减少吗？”里厄老太太问。","“Will they keep to the reduced lighting as long as the plague lasts?” Mme Rieux asked."
"“我想是这样的。”","“I expect so.”"
"“但愿不要拖到冬天。否则就太令人沮丧了。”","“Let’s hope it doesn’t last till winter.It would be terribly depressing.”"
"“对呀。”里厄说。","“Yes,” Rieux said."
"他发现母亲在凝视着他的前额。他知道最近这些天来的担忧与过度操劳已经在他的额前刻下了印迹。","He saw his mother’s gaze settle on his forehead.He knew that the worry and overwork of the last few days had scored their traces there."
"“今天一切都还好吧？”","“Didn’t things go well today?” his mother asked."
"“哦，像往常一样。”","“Oh, much as usual.”"
"像往常一样！也就是说，从巴黎运来的新血清似乎比第一批的效果要差，而死亡率又在上升。除了患者家属以外还不可能为其他人进行预防接种；要普遍进行接种，就要大量生产疫苗。大多数淋巴腺肿块始终不见溃破——它们好像正经历周期性的硬化——而病人则感到异常痛苦。在过去的二十四小时又发现了两例新型病情；鼠疫开始引起肺炎了。当天，在一次会议上，极度苦恼的医生们要求省长——这个可怜的人似乎已经黔驴技穷了——颁布新法令来预防肺鼠疫的口对口的传染。省长按他们的要求做了，但像往常一样，他们对鼠疫还处于摸索阶段。","As usual!That was to say the new consignment of serum sent from Paris seemed less effective than the first, and the death-rate was rising.It was still impossible to administer prophylactic inoculations elsewhere than in families already attacked; if its use was to be generalized, very large quantities of the vaccine would have been needed.Most of the buboes refused to burst—it was as if they underwent a seasonal hardening—and the victims suffered horribly.During the last twenty-four hours there had been two cases of a new form of the epidemic; the plague was becoming pneumonic.On this very day, in the course of a meeting, the muchharassed doctors had pressed the Prefect—the unfortunate man seemed quite at his wits’ end—to issue new regulations to prevent contagion being carried from mouth to mouth, as happens in pneumonic plague.The Prefect had done as they wished, but as usual they were groping, more or less, in the dark."
"他望着母亲，她那枣骝的眼睛里透出的温柔使他心底涌起一种久违了的情感。","Looking at his mother, he felt an uprush of a half-forgotten emotion, the love of his boyhood, at the sight of her soft brown gaze intent on him."
"“妈妈，你害怕吗？”","“Don’t you ever feel alarmed, Mother?”"
"“哦，到了我这把年纪已没有什么可怕的了。”","“Oh, at my age there isn’t much left to fear.”"
"“白天的时间很长，而我又几乎不着家。”","“The days are very long, and just now I’m hardly ever at home.”"
"“只要我知道你会回来，我就不在乎在家等着你。而你不在家的时候，我就想着你正在干些什么。你有她的消息吗？”","“I don’t mind waiting, if I know you’re going to come back.And when you aren’t here, I think of what you’re doing.Have you any news?”"
"“有，最近收到的一份电报说一切都很好。但我知道，她这样说只是为了不让我担心。”","“Yes, if I’m to believe the last telegram, everything’s going as well as could be expected.But I know she says that to prevent my worrying.”"
"门铃响了。医生朝母亲笑了笑，走过去开门。塔鲁站在阴暗的楼梯口，看上去就像一只大灰熊。里厄请他的客人面朝书桌坐下，自己则站在写字椅后面。他们之间隔着一盏台灯，这是室内唯一的光源。","The doorbell rang.The doctor gave his mother a smile and went to open the door.In the dim light on the landing Tarrou looked like a big gray bear.Rieux gave his visitor a seat facing his desk, while he himself remained standing behind the desk chair.Between them was the only light in the room, a desk lamp."
"塔鲁直入主题。“我想，”塔鲁说，“我可以非常坦率地与你谈谈。”","Tarrou came straight to the point.“I know,” he said, “that I can talk to you quite frankly.”"
"里厄点点头。","Rieux nodded."
"“再过两周，最多一个月，”塔鲁接着说，“你在这里也将无济于事。情况将会失控。”","“In a fortnight, or a month at most,” Tarrou continued, “you’ll serve no purpose here.Things will have got out of hand.”"
"“你说得对。”","“I agree.”"
"“卫生部门效率太低——一方面是由于缺少人手——而你也忙得筋疲力尽。”","“The sanitary department is inefficient—understaffed, for one thing—and you’re worked off your feet.”"
"里厄承认事实确实是这样。","Rieux admitted this was so."
"“而且，”塔鲁说，“听说当局正在考虑一种全民招募行动，所有身体健康的男子都必须加入到这场鼠疫之战。”","“Well,” Tarrou said, “I’ve heard that the authorities are thinking of a sort of conscription of the population, and all men in good health will be required to help in fighting the plague.”"
"“你的消息倒是真的。但当局这样做可能会不得民心，因此省长还在犹豫。”","“Your information was correct.But the authorities are in none too good odor as it is, and the Prefect can’t make up his mind.”"
"“如果他不敢冒险强制招募人员，为什么不招募志愿者呢？”","“If he daren’t risk compulsion, why not call for voluntary help?”"
"“已经招募过了。但人们的反应很冷淡。”","“It’s been done.The response was poor.”"
"“这是通过官方途径来弄的，而且也不积极。官僚们缺乏想象力。他们根本不能处理真正的灾情。他们所想到的应对措施连普通的感冒都几乎应付不了。如果我们任由他们这样做，他们就会完蛋，而我们也都会完蛋。”","“It was done through official channels, and half-heartedly.What they’re short on is imagination.Officialdom can never cope with something really catastrophic.And the remedial measures they think up are hardly adequate for a common cold.If we let them carry on like this they’ll soon be dead, and so shall we.”"
"“这很有可能，”里厄说，“不过，我该告诉你，他们正在考虑用犯人来干所谓的‘粗活’。”","“That’s more than likely,” Rieux said.“I should tell you, however, that they’re thinking of using the prisoners in the jails for what we call the ‘heavy work.’”"
"“我觉得还是用自由人更好些。”","“I’d rather free men were employed.”"
"“我也这么想。不过，可以问你为什么这么想呢？”","“So would I.But might I ask why you feel like that?”"
"“我讨厌被判死刑的人。”","“I loathe men’s being condemned to death.”"
"里厄正视着塔鲁。","Rieux looked Tarrou in the eyes."
"“那么——该怎么办呢？”他问。","“So—what?” he asked."
"“这正是我要说的。我已拟好一个计划来组织志愿者卫生队。请授权让我去实施我的计划，并且把那些官僚们撇在一边。无论如何，当局都已忙不过来了。我在许多行业都有朋友，他们可以组成第一批骨干。当然，我本人也会参与进来。”","“It’s this I have to say.I’ve drawn up a plan for voluntary groups of helpers.Get me empowered to try out my plan, and then let’s sidetrack officialdom.In any case the authorities have their hands more than full already.I have friends in many walks of life; they’ll form a nucleus to start from.And, of course, I’ll take part in it myself.”"
"“不用说，”里厄回答道，“我非常乐于接受你的建议。助手是不嫌多的，尤其是对现在干我这行的人来说。我负责说服当局同意你的这个计划。毕竟，他们也别无选择。但是——”里厄思考了一下说，“但是做这项工作可能会有生命危险，我想你是知道的。但我觉得我还得问问你，你已经考虑过将来的危险了吗？”","“I need hardly tell you,” Rieux replied, “that I accept your suggestion most gladly.One can’t have too many helpers, especially in a job like mine under present conditions.I undertake to get your plan approved by the authorities.Anyhow, they’ve, no choice.But—” Rieux pondered.“But I take it you know that work of this kind may prove fatal to the worker.And I feel I should ask you this; have you weighed the dangers?”"
"塔鲁用他那双灰色的眼睛安详地看着医生。","Tarrou’s gray eyes met the doctor’s gaze serenely."
"“你对帕纳卢的布道怎么看，医生？”","“What did you think of Paneloux’s sermon, doctor?”"
"问题提得非常自然，而里厄回答得也很自然。","The question was asked in a quite ordinary tone, and Rieux answered in the same tone."
"“我在医院里已经看过太多的生老病死了，根本不欣赏这种集体惩罚的说法。但是，你要知道，天主教徒有时嘴上说的并非是他们心里所想的。他们其实比看起来的要好。”","“I’ve seen too much of hospitals to relish any idea of collective punishment.But, as you know, Christians sometimes say that sort of thing without really thinking it.They’re better than they seem.”"
"“那么，你也同帕纳卢一样认为鼠疫有它好的一面，它让人们睁开双眼，也迫使人们思考？”","“However, you think, like Paneloux, that the plague has its good side; it opens men’s eyes and forces them to take thought?”"
"医生不耐烦地把头一仰。","The doctor tossed his head impatiently."
"“人类的所有疾病都是如此。适用于所有不幸的道理也适用于鼠疫。它使人类的思想得到提升。当然，看到鼠疫带来的苦难，只有疯子、懦夫或完全瞎了的人才会向它屈服。”","“So does every ill that flesh is heir to.What’s true of all the evils in the world is true of plague as well.It helps men to rise above themselves.All the same, when you see the misery it brings, you’d need to be a madman, or a coward, or stone blind, to give in tamely to the plague.”"
"里厄正要提高嗓门，塔鲁却打了一个小手势，似乎是要他平静下来。塔鲁还面带微笑。“好吧，”里厄耸耸肩说，“但你还没有回答我的问题。你已经考虑过后果了吗？”","Rieux had hardly raised his voice at all; but Tarrou made a slight gesture as if to calm him.He was smiling.“Yes.” Rieux shrugged his shoulders.“But you haven’t answered my question yet.Have you weighed the consequences?”"
"塔鲁挺直身子靠着椅背坐好，接着又把头凑到灯前。","Tarrou squared his shoulders against the back of the chair, then moved his head forward into the light."
"“你相信天主吗，医生？”","“Do you believe in God, doctor?”"
"问题依然提得很自然。但这一次，里厄想了一会儿才回答说，“不相信——但是这又有什么真正的意义呢？我在黑暗中摸索着，努力想摸索出什么道理。但我早就不觉得有什么稀奇了。”","Again the question was put in an ordinary tone.But this time Rieux took longer to find his answer.“No—but what does that really mean?I’m fumbling in the dark, struggling to make something out.But I’ve long ceased finding that original.”"
"“这不正是——你和帕纳卢之间的巨大分歧吗？”","“Isn’t that it—the gulf between Paneloux and you?”"
"“我不这么认为。帕纳卢是个有学问的人，一个学者。他从未与死亡打过交道，因此他能如此信心十足地谈论真理——绝对的真理。但是，探望过教区居民、听到过垂死者喘息声的每一位乡村教士都会和我有同样的想法。他首先会设法减轻人们的痛苦，然后才会想到苦难的好处。”里厄站起身来，这时他的脸已处在暗处。“我们不谈这个问题了，”他说，“既然你不想回答。”","“I doubt it.Paneloux is a man of learning, a scholar.He hasn’t come in contact with death; that’s why he can speak with such assurance of the truth—with a capital T.But every country priest who visits his parishioners and has heard a man gasping for breath on his deathbed thinks as I do.He’d try to relieve human suffering before trying to point out its excellence.”Rieux stood up; his face was now in shadow.“Let’s drop the subject,” he said, “as you won’t answer.”"
"塔鲁仍旧坐着，又是面带微笑。","Tarrou remained seated in his chair; he was smiling again."
"“让我以一个问题来回答好了。”","“Suppose I answer with a question.”"
"这会儿医生也笑了。","The doctor now smiled, too."
"“你喜欢神秘，对吧？好，你问吧。”","“You like being mysterious, don’t you?Yes, fire away.”"
"“我的问题是，”塔鲁说，“既然你不相信天主，那你自己为什么显示出那样的奉献精神呢？我想你的回答也许可以帮助我回答你的提问。”","“My question’s this,” said Tarrou.“Why do you yourself show such devotion, considering you don’t believe in God?I suspect your answer may help me to mine.”"
"医生的脸依然在暗处，他说他其实已经回答过了：如果他相信天主是万能的，他就不会再去治疗病人，让天主去做好了。但是世上没有一人相信天主是万能的。没有一人会相信，甚至连信仰天主的帕纳卢也不会相信。事实已经证明，没有一人会完全依赖天主。不管怎样，里厄相信自己在这点上是正确的——同他发现的世间万物作斗争。","His face still in shadow, Rieux said that he’d already answered: that if he believed in an all-powerful God he would cease curing the sick and leave that to Him.But no one in the world believed in a God of that sort; no, not even Paneloux, who believed that he believed in such a God.And this was proved by the fact that no one ever threw himself on Providence completely.Anyhow, in this respect Rieux believed himself to be on the right road—in fighting against creation as he found it."
"“啊，”塔鲁说，“那就是你对自己的职业的看法吗？”","“Ah,” Tarrou remarked.“So that’s the idea you have of your profession?”"
"“差不多吧。”里厄说着又重新回到灯光下。","“More or less.”The doctor came back into the light."
"塔鲁双唇一撅，轻轻吹了声口哨，医生目不转睛地看着他。","Tarrou made a faint whistling noise with his lips, and the doctor gazed at him."
"“对，你在想有这种看法需要自豪感。但请你相信，正是这种自豪感一直在鼓励着我继续做下去。我不清楚情况将会怎样，也不清楚一切结束之后又会怎样。我清楚的是现实，现在有病人需要接受治疗。过段时间，也许他们会去思考，我也会去思考。但目前最要紧的是治愈他们的病。我尽全力保护他们，仅此而已。”","“Yes, you’re thinking it calls for pride to feel that way.But I assure you I’ve no more than the pride that’s needed to keep me going.I have no idea what’s awaiting me, or what will happen when all this ends.For the moment I know this; there are sick people and they need curing.Later on, perhaps, they’ll think things over; and so shall I.But what’s wanted now is to make them well.I defend them as best I can, that’s all.”"
"“对付谁呢？”","“Against whom?”"
"里厄转身面对着窗口。地平线上那一条模糊的暗影显示着大海的存在。他唯一的感觉是筋疲力尽，同时又在抵御一种突如其来、无法理喻的想一吐为快的冲动。他觉得自己身旁的这个人也许是个怪人，却跟他属于同一类人。","Rieux turned to the window.A shadow-line on the horizon told of the presence of the sea.He was conscious only of his exhaustion, and at the same time was struggling against a sudden, irrational impulse to unburden himself a little more to his companion; an eccentric, perhaps, but who, he guessed, was one of his own kind."
"“我不知道，塔鲁，我真的不知道。我刚入行时，可以说是有点‘茫然’，因为我想行医，因为它是一门职业，是一门年轻人所向往的职业。或许，也因为这一行对我这样一个工人的儿子来说做起来特别难。后来，我不得不眼睁睁看着人们死去。你知道有些人是不愿死去的吗？你听到过一个女人在咽气之前大声尖叫着‘我不要死’吗？对，我听到过。而那时我觉得自己对此永远无法无动于衷。那时我还年轻，对所有的一切都感到愤怒，至少当时我是这么想的。后来，我变得更谦逊了。只不过，我还是不习惯于看着人们死去。仅此而已。但毕竟——”","“I haven’t a notion, Tarrou; I assure you I haven’t a notion.When I entered this profession, I did it ‘abstractedly,’ so to speak; because I had a desire for it, because it meant a career like another, one that young men often aspire to.Perhaps, too, because it was particularly difficult for a workman’s son, like myself.And then I had to see people die.Do you know that there are some who refuse to die?Have you ever heard a woman scream ‘Never!’ with her last gasp?Well, I have.And then I saw that I could never get hardened to it.I was young then, and I was outraged by the whole scheme of things, or so I thought.Subsequently I grew more modest.Only, I’ve never managed to get used to seeing people die.That’s all I know.Yet after all—” "
"里厄突然停下话来，重新坐下。他感到口干舌燥。","Rieux fell silent and sat down.He felt his mouth dry."
"“毕竟——什么？”塔鲁轻声追问道。","“After all—?” Tarrou prompted softly."
"“毕竟，”医生说着，重又犹豫起来，眼睛注视着塔鲁接着说，“像你这样的人是最能理解这事了。既然人间的规律是人终有一死，或许上帝宁愿人们不相信他，宁愿人们用自己的力量来与死亡抗争，而不是仰望苍天，乞求默不作声的他。”","“After all,” the doctor repeated, then hesitated again, fixing his eyes on Tarrou, “it’s something that a man of your sort can understand most likely, but, since the order of the world is shaped by death, mightn’t it be better for God if we refuse to believe in Him and struggle with all our might against death, without raising our eyes toward the heaven where He sits in silence.”"
"塔鲁点了点头。","Tarrou nodded."
"“你说得对。但是你的胜利只是暂时的，仅此而已。”","“Yes.But your victories will never be lasting; that’s all.”"
"里厄的脸沉了下来。","Rieux’s face darkened."
"“对，我知道。但这不是放弃斗争的理由。”","“Yes, I know that.But it’s no reason for giving up the struggle.”"
"“这的确不是理由。只不过，我现在就可以想象这场鼠疫对你意味着什么。”","“No reason, I agree.Only, I now can picture what this plague must mean for you.”"
"“对。意味着没完没了的失败。”","“Yes.A never ending defeat.”"
"塔鲁盯着医生看了一会儿，接着转身拖着沉重的脚步朝门口走去。里厄跟了上来，当他快要跟上塔鲁时，正低头看着地板的塔鲁突然说：","Tarrou stared at the doctor for a moment, then turned and tramped heavily toward the door.Rieux followed him and was almost at his side when Tarrou, who was staring at the floor, suddenly said: "
"“谁教会你这一切的，医生？”","“Who taught you all this, doctor?”"
"医生立刻回答说：","The reply came promptly: "
"“痛苦。”","“Suffering.”"
"里厄将诊所门打开，告诉塔鲁说他也要出门，他要去郊区看望一位病人。塔鲁提出他俩一块儿去，里厄答应了。在大厅里他们遇见了里厄老太太，医生把塔鲁介绍给她。","Rieux opened the door of his surgery and told Tarrou that he, too, was going out; he had a patient to visit in the suburbs.Tarrou suggested they should go together and he agreed.In the hall they encountered Mme Rieux, and the doctor introduced Tarrou to her."
"“我的一位朋友，”他说。","“A friend of mine,” he said."
"“哦，”里厄老太太说，“非常高兴认识你。”","“Indeed,” said Mme Rieux, “I’m very pleased to make your acquaintance.”"
"当她走开时，塔鲁转身看着她的背影。在楼梯口，医生按了一下开关，想打开那些楼梯过道灯。但是楼梯依然一片漆黑。也许又施行了什么节电的新的举措。但是，这一切真的无从知晓。在过去的这段时间里，不管是在房子里，还是大街上，一切都乱套了。也许只是因为看门人和其他市民一样，已不再关心他的哥们了。医生没有时间继续思考下去，他身后传来了塔鲁的声音。","When she left them Tarrou turned to gaze after her.On the landing the doctor pressed a switch to turn on the lights along the stairs.But the stairs remained in darkness.Possibly some new light-saving order had come into force.Really, however, there was no knowing; for some time past, in the streets no less than in private houses, everything had been going out of order.It might be only that the concierge, like nearly everyone in the town, was ceasing to bother about his dudes, The doctor had no time to follow up his thoughts; Tarrou’s voice came from behind him."
"“我还要说一句，医生，即使你听了会感到有点儿可笑。你是完全正确的。”","“Just one word more, doctor, even if it sounds to you a bit nonsensical.You are perfectly right.”"
"医生只是在黑暗中微微耸了耸肩。","The doctor merely gave a little shrug, unseen in the darkness."
"“老实说，我对此一无所知。但是你——你对此有何高见？”","“To tell the truth, all that’s outside my range.But you—what do you know about it?”"
"“啊，”塔鲁十分平静地说，“我几乎是无所不知。”","“Ah,” Tarrou replied quite coolly, “I’ve little left to learn.”"
"医生停下脚步，身后的塔鲁在楼梯上突然脚底一滑。他一把抓住里厄的肩膀才稳住了身子。","Rieux paused and, behind him, Tarrou’s foot slipped on a step.He steadied himself by gripping the doctor’s shoulder."
"“你真的认为你非常了解生活吗？”","“Do you really imagine you know everything about life?”"
"黑暗中传来了同样平静而自信的回答：","The answer came through the darkness in the same cool, confident tone."
"“是的。”","“Yes.”"
"走上大街，他们发觉时间已经很晚了，可能已到十一点了。城里一片寂静，除了一些模糊的沙沙声。远处隐约传来救护车的叮当声。他们跨进小车，里厄发动了引擎。","Once in the street, they realized it must be quite late, eleven perhaps.All was silence in the town, except for some vague rustlings.An ambulance bell clanged faintly in the distance.They stepped into the car and Rieux started the engine."
"“明天你必须来医院一趟，”医生说，“来打预防针。不过，在开始这项冒险的工作之前，你最好要清楚自己的生存机会，只有三分之一。”","“You must come to the hospital tomorrow,” he said, “for an injection.But, before embarking on this adventure, you’d better know your chances of coming out of it alive; they’re one in three.”"
"“这种估计是站不住脚的，你和我一样清楚，医生。一百年前，鼠疫夺去了波斯一座城里所有市民的生命，只有一人除外。而这个唯一的幸存者正是一个洗尸人，那人在整个鼠疫期间都在工作。”","“That sort of reckoning doesn’t hold water; you know it, doctor, as well as I.A hundred years ago plague wiped out the entire population of a town in Persia, with one exception.And the sole survivor was precisely the man whose job it was to wash the dead bodies, and who carried on throughout the epidemic.”"
"“他不过是保住了他那三分之一的生存机会，仅此而已。”里厄放低了嗓门说，“不过你是对的，我们对此几乎一无所知。”","“He pulled off his one-in-three chance, that’s all.” Rieux had lowered his voice.“But you’re right; we know next to nothing on the subject.”"
"汽车驶入了郊区。车灯照亮了空荡荡的街道。里厄停了车。站在车前，里厄问塔鲁是否想进屋去。塔鲁说：“是的。”空中闪过的一丝微光照亮了他们的脸庞。","They were entering the suburbs.The headlights lit up empty streets.The car stopped.Standing in front of it, Rieux asked Tarrou if he’d like to come in.Tarrou said: “Yes.”A glimmer of light from the sky lit up their faces."
"里厄突然发出一声短促的笑声，听起来透着十分友好的意味。","Suddenly Rieux gave a short laugh, and there was much friendliness in it."
"“说说吧，塔鲁！到底是什么东西促使你想参与进来？”","“Out with it, Tarrou!What on earth prompted you to take a hand in this?”"
"“我不知道。也许是我的道德准则吧。”","“I don’t know.My code of morals, perhaps.”"
"“你的道德准则？是什么准则？”","“Your code of morals?What code?”"
"“理解。”","“Comprehension.”"
"塔鲁转身朝那房子走去，直到他们走进那位老气喘病人的房间为止，里厄没有再看到塔鲁的脸。","Tarrou turned toward the house and Rieux did not see his face again until they were in the old asthma patient’s room."
"第十五章","Chapter 15"
"第二天，塔鲁就开始展开工作，招收了第一批卫生队工作人员，不久后又成立了多个卫生队。不过，笔者并不想过分强调这些卫生队应有的重要性。毫无疑问，如今我们城里确实有许多市民忍不住想要夸大它们的作用。但笔者倾向于这样的看法：人们如果过分夸大高尚行为的重要性，可能暗示出对人性阴暗面给予间接却有力的赞颂。因为这种态度暗示出这种高尚行为是光彩夺目的，因为它的罕见，而麻木和冷漠的态度则更为常见。笔者是不赞同这种观点的。世上的罪恶都是缘于无知，因而没有被理解的善良愿望可能会带来与恶毒行为一样的危害。总的来说，好人总是比坏人多，而这并非问题所在。但人们的无知程度是有差异的，这就是所谓的邪恶与美德的差别。最无可救药的邪恶是这样一种无知——自认为无所不知，因而认为有权杀人。杀人犯的灵魂是盲目的；没有真知灼见就没有真正的善良与仁爱。","Next day Tarrou set to work and enrolled a first team of workers, soon to be followed by many others.However, it is not the narrator’s intention to ascribe to these sanitary groups more importance than their due.Doubtless today many of our fellow citizens are apt to yield to the temptation of exaggerating the services they rendered.But the narrator is inclined to think that by attributing overimportance to praiseworthy actions one may, by implication, be paying indirect but potent homage to the worse side of human nature.For this attitude implies that such actions shine out as rare exceptions, while callousness and apathy are the general rule.The narrator does not share that view.The evil that is in the world always comes of ignorance, and good intentions may do as much harm as malevolence, if they lack understanding.On the whole, men are more good than bad; that, however, isn’t the real point.But they are more or less ignorant, and it is this that we call vice or virtue; the most incorrigible vice being that of an ignorance that fancies it knows everything and therefore claims for itself the right to kill.The soul of the murderer is blind; and there can be no true goodness nor true love without the utmost clear-sightedness."
"这样，我们对塔鲁一手建立起来的卫生队应该给予客观而肯定的评价。因此，笔者不愿用过于热情洋溢的词汇来赞扬塔鲁的勇气与奉献，而只是对此给予相对恰当的重视。但他会继续记录下鼠疫带给我们市民那种痛苦而想要作出反抗的心情。","Hence the sanitary groups, whose creation was entirely Tarrou’s work, should be considered with objectivity as well as with approval.And this is why the narrator declines to vaunt in over-glowing terms a courage and a devotion to which he attributes only a relative and reasonable importance.But he will continue being the chronicler of the troubled, rebellious hearts of our townspeople under the impact of the plague."
"那些加入当时所谓的“卫生队”的人们实际上并非有多高尚，因为他们知道这事非做不可，那个时候他们不这样做倒是不可想象的。这些卫生队使我们的市民对疫病有了更深刻的了解，也使他们相信，既然鼠疫已经发生，他们就该竭尽全力与之斗争。","Those who enrolled in the “sanitary squads,” as they were called, had, indeed, no such great merit in doing as they did, since they knew it was the only thing to do, and the unthinkable thing would then have been not to have brought themselves to do it.These groups enabled our townsfolk to come to grips with the disease and convinced them that, now that plague was among us, it was up to them to do whatever could be done to fight it."
"这样一来，抗疫成为了一些人的职责，因而显现出它的实质，也就是说，这是大家的事情。","Since plague became in this way some men’s duty, it revealed itself as what it really was; that is, the concern of all."
"至此，一切都很好。但教师受到表扬并非是因为他教给学生二加二等于四，而可能是因为他选择了这个值得赞美的职业。我们要说的是，塔鲁和其他许多人选择了证明二加二等于四的道路而不是与之相反，这值得表扬。但我们也要说，他们的良好愿望，与老师以及一切跟老师怀有相同情感的人的愿望一样，而且，这是人类的光荣，因为他们的数量要比人们想象的还要多——至少笔者这样认为。不用说，笔者很清楚，有人会提出不同的观点，会说这些人是在冒着生命的危险。然而，历史上多次出现过这种时刻——敢说二加二等于四的人会被处死。","So far, so good.But we do not congratulate a schoolmaster on teaching that two and two make four, though we may, perhaps, congratulate him on having chosen his laudable vocation.Let us then say it was praiseworthy that Tarrou and so many others should have elected to prove that two and two make four rather than the contrary; but let us add that this good will of theirs was one that is shared by the schoolmaster and by all who have the same feelings as the schoolmaster, and, be it said to the credit of mankind, they are more numerous than one would think—such, anyhow, is the narrator’s conviction.Needless to say, he can see quite clearly a point that could be made against him, which is that these men were risking their lives.But again and again there comes a time in history when the man who dares to say that two and two make four is punished with death."
"老师也很清楚这一点。但问题不是要知道这样运算的结果会得到什么惩罚或是奖赏。重要的是要知道二加二是否的确等于四。对于我们城里那些冒着生命危险的市民来说，重要的是要清楚他们是否已经身陷鼠疫之中，以及他们是否必须与鼠疫抗争。","The schoolteacher is well aware of this.And the question is not one of knowing what punishment or reward attends the making of this calculation.The question is that of knowing whether two and two do make four.For those of our townsfolk who risked their lives in this predicament the issue was whether or not plague was in their midst and whether or not they must fight against it."
"那时我们城里有许多没经验的伦理学家正四处宣扬，说人们对瘟疫无能为力，还说应该向它低头屈服。而塔鲁、里厄以及他们的朋友可能想过这样或那样的解决方法，但得出的结论都是一样的：他们确信必须要作这样或那样的斗争，而不该低头屈服。最根本的事情就是要挽救尽可能多的生命，让他们不至于注定要与世诀别。而要做到这一点，只有一个途径：与鼠疫抗争。这种态度并没有什么值得称赞之处，它只不过是合乎情理罢了。","Many fledgling moralists in those days were going about our town proclaiming there was nothing to be done about it and we should bow to the inevitable.And Tarrou, Rieux, and their friends might give one answer or another, but its conclusion was always the same, their certitude that a fight must be put up, in this way or that, and there must be no bowing down.The essential thing was to save the greatest possible number of persons from dying and being doomed to unending separation.And to do this there was only one resource: to fight the plague.There was nothing admirable about this attitude; it was merely logical."
"因此，老卡斯特尔医生满怀信心、不遗余力地利用手边可用的仪器，就地取材制造抗鼠疫血清就是自然而然的事情了。他和里厄都希望从当地的鼠疫杆菌培养出来的血清能比外地运来的血清具有更显著的疗效，因为当地的鼠疫杆菌与教科书上所说的普通的热带鼠疫杆菌存在少许不同之处。。而且卡斯特尔期望能在极短的时间内尽快制成他的第一批血清。","Thus it was only natural that old Dr. Castel should plod away with unshaken confidence, never sparing himself, at making anti-plague serum on the spot with the makeshift equipment at his disposal.Rieux shared his hope that a vaccine made with cultures of the bacilli obtained locally would take effect more actively than serum coming from outside, since the local bacillus differed slightly from the normal plague bacillus as defined in textbooks of tropical diseases.And Castel expected to have his first supply ready within a surprisingly short period."
"因此，那个毫无英雄气概的格朗现在做起类似于卫生队秘书长的工作来也是自然而然的事情。塔鲁组织起来的几支卫生队在城市的居民密集区工作，味的是改善那里的卫生条件。他们的职责就是督促家家户户保持良好的卫生状况，并登记那些未经消毒的阁楼和地窖。其他几支志愿者队伍跟随医生挨家挨户地出诊，负责运送感染者，后来由于缺少司机，他们甚至驾驶车辆来运送病人和尸体。这一切都必须作登记和统计工作，格朗承担起了这项工作。","That, too, is why it was natural that Grand, who had nothing of the hero about him, should now be acting as a sort of general secretary to the sanitary squads.A certain number of the groups organized by Tarrou were working in the congested areas of the town, with a view to improving the sanitary conditions there.Their duties were to see that houses were kept in a proper hygienic state and to list attics and cellars that had not been disinfected by the official sanitary service.Other teams of volunteers accompanied the doctors on their house-to-house visits, saw to the evacuation of infected persons, and subsequently, owing to the shortage of drivers, even drove the vehicles conveying sick persons and dead bodies.All this involved the upkeep of registers and statistics, and Grand undertook the task."
"从这个角度来看，笔者认为格朗比里厄或塔鲁更能体现出所有卫生队员那种默默奉献的精神。他没有一丝犹豫就答应承担起这项工作，体现了他天生仁慈的性格。他提出的唯一要求是干些轻松的事情：他太老了，其他活儿他已干不动了。他每晚可以腾出六到八点两个小时的时间。当里厄热情地向他表示谢意时，他似乎感到有些惊讶：“哎呀，那样做并不难！鼠疫来了，我们得进行抵抗，这是明摆着的。啊，我真希望所有的事情都这么简单！”接着，他又老调重谈起来。有时，晚上格朗在完成报告和统计工作后，会和里厄聊一聊。很快，塔鲁也加入到谈话中来，格朗则越来越喜欢向这两个同伴倾吐自己的心事。而他俩也开始真正有兴趣开始关注格朗在鼠疫期间仍倾力而为的辛苦的文字工作。实际上，他们也从中感到精神放松。","From this angle, the narrator holds that, more than Rieux or Tarrou, Grand was the true embodiment of the quiet courage that inspired the sanitary groups.He had said yes without a moment’s hesitation and with the large-heartedness that was a second nature with him.All he had asked was to be allotted light duties: he was too old for anything else.He could give his time from six to eight every evening.When Rieux thanked him with some warmth, he seemed surprised.“Why, that’s not difficult!Plague is here and we’ve got to make a stand, that’s obvious.Ah, I only wish everything were as simple!”And he went back to his phrase.Sometimes in the evening, when he had filed his reports and worked out his statistics, Grand and Rieux would have a chat.Soon they formed the habit of including Tarrou in their talks and Grand unburdened himself with increasingly apparent pleasure to his two companions.They began to take a genuine interest in the laborious literary task to which he was applying himself while plague raged around him.Indeed, they, too, found in it a relaxation of the strain."
"“你那位马背上的年轻女骑士怎样啦？”塔鲁问。","“How’s your young lady on horseback progressing?” Tarrou would ask."
"而格朗总是怪笑着回答：“她在骑着马小跑着，小跑着！”一天晚上，格朗对他俩说他已决定不用“优雅”这个词来形容他的女骑士了。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　从此以后将改用“苗条”这个词。“这个词更具体些。”他解释说。接着，他向这两位朋友诵读了修改后的新句子：","And invariably Grand would answer J with a wry smile: “Trotting along, trotting along!”One evening Grand announced that he had definitely discarded the adjective “elegant” for his horsewoman.From now on it was replaced by “slim.”“That’s more concrete,” he explained.Soon after, he read out to his two friends the new version of the sentence: "
"“在五月的一个美丽的清晨，一位苗条的女骑士骑着一匹漂亮的枣骝雌马，驰骋在花香四溢的布洛涅林阴大道上。”","“One fine morning in May a slim young horsewoman might have been seen riding a handsome sorrel mare along the flowery avenues of the Bois de Boulogne.”"
"“这样女骑士看起来更棒了，不是吗？而且，我还把‘五月份’改成了‘五月’，因为‘五月份’中的‘份’字把小跑的节奏拉得太长了些，我想你们能明白我的意思。”","“Don’t you agree with me one sees her better that way?And I’ve put ‘one fine morning in May’ because ‘in the month of May’ tended rather to drag out the trot, if you see what I mean.”"
"又有一次，他说“漂亮”这个形容词用得不太妥当。在他看来，这个词表达不到位，因此他在开始思考用另一个修饰语，以便能一下子就形象地“描绘”出他想象中的上等好马。“肥壮”不行，这个词虽然具体，但有点贬义，还有些不雅。“打扮得漂漂亮亮的”这个词他曾想采用，但太累赘，也有点儿不压韵。一天晚上，他兴高采烈地宣布他已想到了合适的词：“一匹黑色的枣骝雌马。”在他看来，“黑色”有着“优雅”与“华丽”的意味。","Next he showed some anxiety about the adjective “handsome.”In his opinion it didn’t convey enough, and he set to looking for an epithet that would promptly and clearly “photograph” the superb animal he saw with his mind’s eye.“Plump” wouldn’t do; though concrete enough, it sounded perhaps a little disparaging, also a shade vulgar.“Beautifully groomed” had tempted him for a moment, but it was cumbrous and made the rhythm limp somewhat.Then one evening he announced triumphantly that he had got it: “A black sorrel mare.”To his thinking, he explained, “black” conveyed a hint of elegance and opulence."
"“这个词不行，”里厄说。“为什么不行？”","“It won’t do,” Rieux said.“Why not?”"
"“因为‘枣骝’这个词指的不是马的品种，它指的是一种颜色。”","“Because ‘sorrel’ doesn’t mean a breed of horse; it’s a color.”"
"“什么颜色？”","“What color?”"
"“嗯——一种颜色——反正不是黑色。”格朗显得很不安。","“Well—er—a color that, anyhow, isn’t black.”Grand seemed greatly troubled."
"“谢谢，”他真诚地说，“幸好有你帮忙！但你也清楚这有多难。”","“Thank you,” he said warmly.“How fortunate you’re here to help me!But you see how difficult it is.”"
"“‘华丽’这词如何？”塔鲁问。","“How about ‘glossy’?” Tarrou suggested."
"格朗盯着他沉思了一会儿，然后说：“对！这个词很好。”他也渐渐绽开了笑颜。","Grand gazed at him meditatively, then “Yes!” he exclaimed.“That’s good.”And slowly his lips parted in a smile."
"过了几天，他又承认“花香四溢的”这个词令他大伤脑筋。因为他只了解奥兰和蒙特利马这两个城市，他有时向朋友们询问一些有关布洛涅林阴大道上花的种类及分布情况。事实上，在里厄和塔鲁的印象里,那些林阴大道并非是“花香四溢的”，但格朗对此深信不疑，这倒使他们怀疑自己记错了。他们这种不确定的态度令他感到奇怪。“只有艺术家才会观察。”他得出了这个结论。但是，一天晚上，医生发现他十分兴奋。因为他已把“花香四溢的”改成了“点缀着鲜花的”。他搓着手说，“人们终于能既看得见花开，又闻得着花香了！脱帽致敬，先生们！”他兴高采烈地诵读着：","Some days later he confessed that the word “flowery” was bothering him considerably.As the only towns he knew were Oran and Montelimar, he sometimes asked his friends to tell him about the avenues of the Bois de Boulogne, what sort of flowers grew in them and how they were disposed.Actually neither Rieux nor Tarrou had ever gathered the impression that those avenues were “flowery,” but Grand’s conviction on the subject shook their confidence in their memories.He was amazed at their uncertainty.“It’s only artists who know how to use their eyes,” was his conclusion.But one evening the doctor found him in a state of much excitement.For “flowery” he had substituted “flower-strewn.”He was rubbing his hands.“At last one can see them, smell them!Hats off, gentlemen!”Triumphantly he read out the sentence: "
"“在五月的一个美丽的清晨，一位苗条的女骑士骑着一匹华丽的枣骝雌马，驰骋在点缀着鲜花的布洛涅林阴大道上。”","“One fine morning in May a slim young horsewoman might have been seen riding a glossy sorrel mare along the flower-strewn avenues of the Bois de Boulogne.”"
"但是，在大声诵读的过程中，句中多处“s”读起来不顺畅，因此，格朗朗读时结结巴巴的。他坐了下来，神情沮丧,接着他向医生提出要回去了。他要再好好考虑考虑。","But, spoken aloud, the numerous “s” sounds had a disagreeable effect and Grand stumbled over them, lisping here and there.He sat down, crestfallen; then he asked the doctor if he might go.Some hard thinking lay ahead of him."
"后来人们知道，就是在那段时间，他在办公室里开始有点儿心不在焉起来。这引起了人们的非议，因为那时市政府不仅工作压力大、人手短缺，而且还不断要承担新的工作任务。他的工作部门也受到了影响，因此，他的领导严厉地批评了他，提醒他说，他拿了工资却没有完成自己本该做好的份内工作。“听说你在卫生队做志愿者。你是在业余时间做这项工作，这我不管。但在这样一个困难时期，你贡献自己力量的最好方式就是要做好你的本职工作。否则，其他工作毫无意义。”","It was about this time, as was subsequently learned, that he began to display signs of absentmindedness in the office.A serious view was taken of these lapses of attention, as the municipality not only was working at high pressure with a reduced staff, but was constantly having new duties thrust upon it.His department suffered, and his chief took him severely to task, pointing out that he was paid to do certain work and was failing to do it as it should be done.“I am told that you are acting as a voluntary helper in the sanitary groups.You do this out ofoffice hours, so it’s no concern of mine.But the best way of making yourself useful in a terrible time like this is to do your work well.Otherwise all the rest is useless.”"
"“他说得对。”格朗对里厄说。","“He’s right,” Grand said to Rieux."
"“是的，他说得对。”医生应和道。","“Yes, he’s right,” the doctor agreed."
"“但我不能沉下心来工作。我一直在考虑句子的押韵问题，却似乎想不出办法。”句子里的齿擦音太多，听起来还是不顺耳，但他想不出该用什么更好的词来表达。而那个一开始令他兴奋不已的“点缀着鲜花的”这个词现在似乎也不令他满意了。花儿有可能是种在路边，也有可能是自然生长在路边的，那怎么能笼统地说花儿“点缀”着街道呢？事实上，有几个晚上，他看起来比里厄还疲劳。","“But I can’t steady my thoughts; it’s the end of my phrase that’s worrying me, I don’t seem able to sort it out.”The plethora of sibilants in the sentence still offended his ear, but he saw no way of amending them without using what were, to his mind, inferior synonyms.And that “flower-strewn” which had rejoiced him when he first lit on it now seemed unsatisfactory.How could one say the flowers were “strewn” when presumably they had been planted along the avenues, or else grew there naturally?On some evenings, indeed, he looked more tired than Rieux."
"确实，他因反复推敲用词而感到筋疲力尽，但他仍然坚持为卫生队做好数据统计和汇编工作。每天晚上，他都更新数据，将它们用统计图表表示出来，并绞尽脑汁以最准确明了的方式来说明情况。他经常到医院去找里厄，要医生给他在办公室或医务室找张桌子。然后，他就摊开文件，像坐在市政府的办公桌旁一样安心工作起来。在弥漫着讨厌的消毒剂和疾病味道的环境中挥动着整理好的每一份纸张，以使墨迹晾干。在这种时候，他努力不去想他的“女骑士”，专心致志地做自己该做的事情。","Yes, this unavailing quest which never left his mind had worn him out; none the less, he went on adding up the figures and compiling the statistics needed for the sanitary groups.Patiently every evening he brought his totals up to date, illustrated them with graphs, and racked his brains to present his data in the most exact, clearest form.Quite often he went to see Rieux at one of the hospitals and asked to be given a table in an office or the dispensary.He would settle down at it with his papers, exactly as he settled down at his desk in the Municipal Office, and wave each completed sheet to dry the ink in the warm air, noisome with disinfectants and the disease itself.At these times he made honest efforts not to think about his “horsewoman,” and concentrate on what he had to do."
"的确，假如人们真的想要树立一些他们称为英雄的榜样，假如这个故事中确实需要一位“英雄”，那么笔者就向读者推荐这位在他看来当之无愧的人选，这位无足轻重、鲜为人知的英雄，一位有点儿善良又有点儿可笑的完美典范。这将使真理恢复其本来面目，使二加二等于四，并将英雄主义置于追求幸福的高尚要求之后而绝非之前的次要地位。这也将赋予这篇记事以特色，也就是用真实的感情来进行叙述——这种感情既不是赤裸裸的邪恶，也不是舞台剧中矫柔造作的慷慨激昂。","Yes, if it is a fact that people like to have examples given them, men of the type they call heroic, and if it is absolutely necessary that this narrative should include a “hero,” the narrator commends to his readers, with, to his thinking, perfect justice, this insignificant and obscure hero who had to his credit only a little goodness of heart and a seemingly absurd ideal.This will render to the truth its due, to the addition of two and two its sum of four, and to heroism the secondary place that rightly falls to it, just after, never before, the noble claim of happiness.It will also give this chronicle its character, which is intended to be that of a narrative made with good feelings—that is to say, feelings that are neither demonstrably bad nor overcharged with emotion in the ugly manner of a stage-play."
"这至少是里厄医生从报纸上看到或是从广播中听到外界对疫区人民传达的信息或鼓励时的想法。慰问品通过空运或陆运送进了这座孤城，此外，表示同情或赞扬的评论也通过报纸或广播涌进城来。医生对这样的长篇大论或获奖感言式的措辞总是感到很厌烦。当然，他知道这的确是一种发自肺腑的关怀。但用来表达这种关怀的只是人们试图表达人与人之间心连心之类的套话；这种语言不适用于描述格朗每天作出的微薄贡献，也不能描绘出格朗在鼠疫中的表现。","Such at least was Dr. Rieux’s opinion when he read in newspapers or heard on the radio the messages and encouragement the outer world transmitted to the plague-ridden populace.Besides the comforts sent by air or overland, compassionate or admiring comments were lavished on the henceforth isolated town, by way of newspaper articles or broadcast talks.And invariably their epical or prize-speech verbiage jarred on the doctor.Needless to say, he knew the sympathy was genuine enough.But it could be expressed only in the conventional language with which men try to express what unites them with mankind in general; a vocabulary quite unsuited, for example, to Grand’s small daily effort, and incapable of describing what Grand stood for under plague conditions."
"有时，到了深夜，城里已是万籁俱寂，医生会允许自己睡几个小时，在上床之前他会打开他的收音机。跨越千山万水，从天涯海角传来充满善意的友好的声音，确实表达了他们想要表达的四海之内皆兄弟的人类情感，但同时也证实了任何人都不能真正分担他所看不到的痛苦。“奥兰！奥兰！”声音徒劳地从海外传来，里厄徒劳地、聚精会神地听着。传来的都是些高谈阔论，这使得格朗与讲话者之间无法逾越的鸿沟变得越来越宽。“奥兰，我们和你在一起！”他们充满感情地呐喊着。但医生告诉自己，他们不可能生死都在一起——“一切只能如此。他们离得太远了。”","Sometimes at midnight, in the great silence of the sleep-bound town, the doctor turned on his radio before going to bed for the few hours’ sleep he allowed himself.And from the ends of the earth, across thousands of miles of land and sea, kindly, well-meaning speakers tried to voice their fellow-feeling, and indeed did so, but at the same time proved the utter incapacity of every man truly to share in suffering that he cannot see.“Oran! Oran!”In vain the call rang over oceans, in vain Rieux listened hopefully; always the tide of eloquence began to flow, bringing home still more the unbridgeable gulf that lay between Grand and the speaker.“Oran, we’re with you!” they called emotionally.But not, the doctor told himself, to love or to die together—“and that’s the only way.They’re too remote.”"
"第十六章","Chapter 16"
"在鼠疫到达顶峰的前夕，瘟神正在积聚全部力量，准备给这座城市以致命一击。这时应该记录下像朗贝尔这样执着的人们，他们为了找回失去的幸福、为了阻挠鼠疫夺去他们奋战到底也要保护好的身家性命作出了长期的、令人心痛的却又单调乏味的努力。他们以这种方式来抵制将要加在自己身上的桎梏，虽然这种抵制行为不像其他做法那样值得赞扬，但（在笔者看来）它也有它的意义，而且世人也见证了这样的行为，甚至它的徒劳无益和缺乏凝聚力反而彰显了一种积极的自豪感。","And, as it so happens, what has yet to be recorded before coming to the culmination, during the period when the plague was gathering all its forces to fling them at the town and lay it waste, is the long, heartrendingly monotonous struggle put up by some obstinate people like Rambert to recover their lost happiness and to balk the plague of that part of themselves which they were ready to defend in the last ditch.This was their way of resisting the bondage closing in upon them, and while their resistance lacked the active virtues of the other, it had (to the narrator’s thinking) its point, and moreover it bore witness, even lit its futility and incoherences, to a salutary pride."
"为了不让鼠疫打败自己，朗贝尔在斗争着。正如他对里厄所说的那样，当他确定无法通过合法途径出城时，他就决定另寻出路。他首先向咖啡馆服务员探口风。服务员往往对幕后情况非常了解。但是他最初接触的几位服务员只清楚这种设法脱逃的行为会受到严厉的惩处。在一家咖啡馆里，他竟然被看作是煽动出城者而被毫不客气地赶出门去。直到他在里厄家碰到了科塔尔，事情才有了些进展。那天，他又向里厄说起自己在行政机关奔波无果的事情，而科塔尔听到了他们谈话的末尾。几天后，科塔尔在街上遇到了朗贝尔，他以自己近来在所有社交场合中所采取的亲昵无比的方式与朗贝尔打招呼。","Rambert fought to prevent the plague from besting him.Once assured that there was no way of getting out of the town by lawful methods, he decided, as he told Rieux, to have recourse to others.He began by sounding cafe waiters.A waiter usually knows much of what’s going on behind the scenes.But the first he spoke to knew only of the very heavy penalties imposed on such attempts at evasion.In one of the cafes he visited he was actually taken for a stool-pigeon and curtly sent about his business.It was not until he happened to meet Cottard at Rieux’s place that he made a little headway.On that day he and Rieux had been talking again about his unsuccessful efforts to interest the authorities in his case, and Cottard heard the tail end of the conversation.Some days later Cottard met him in the street and greeted him with the hail-fellow-well-met manner that he now used on all occasions."
"“你好啊，朗贝尔！仍然毫无进展吗？”","“Hello, Rambert!Still no luck?”"
"“毫无进展。”","“None whatever.”"
"“指望那些繁文缛节的商人是没有用的。他们即使尝试了也还是无法理解别人。”","“It’s no good counting on the red-tape merchants.They couldn’t understand if they tried.”"
"“我知道，所以我正在另寻出路。但这很难。”","“I know that, and I’m trying to find some other way.But it’s damned difficult.”"
"“对，”科塔尔说，“这确实很难。”","“Yes,” Cottard replied.“It certainly is.”"
"但是，他知道一种解决方法，并向朗贝尔介绍说，很久以来，他经常出入奥兰的咖啡馆，结识了很多朋友，也了解到有一个“组织”专干这一行，这让朗贝尔听了倍感惊讶。事实上，科塔尔近来开始有些入不敷出，现在正在从事配给商品的走私活动。通过贩卖一些价格稳步上涨的走私香烟和劣酒，他已经小赚了一笔。","He, however, knew a way to go about it, and he explained to Rambert, who was much surprised to learn this, that for some time past he had been going the rounds of the cafes, had made a number of acquaintances, and had learned of the existence of an “organization” handling this sort of business.The truth was that Cottard, who had been beginning to live above his means, was now involved in smuggling ventures concerned with rationed goods.Selling contraband cigarettes and inferior liquor at steadily rising prices, he was on the way to building up a small fortune."
"“这事儿你非常确信吗？”朗贝尔问。","“Are you quite sure of this?” Rambert asked."
"“确信无疑。前几天有人向我建议过。”","“Quite.I had a proposal of the sort made to me the other day.”"
"“但你并没有采用这建议。”","“But you didn’t accept it.”"
"“哦，你不必怀疑。”科塔尔亲切地说，“我没这样做，是因为我自己不想走。我有我的理由。”他沉默了一会儿，又接着说：“我想，你是不会想知道我的理由的。”","“Oh, come, there’s no need to be suspicious.” Cottard’s tone was genial.“I didn’t accept it because, personally, I’ve no wish to leave.I have my reasons.”After a short silence he added: “You don’t ask me what my reasons are, I notice.”"
"“我认为，”朗贝尔回答说，“这不关我的事。”","“I take it,” Rambert replied, “that they’re none of my business.”"
"“在某种程度上说，这的确与你无关。但是换一种角度来看——对，可以这样说，自从发生鼠疫以来，我在这里感到自在多了。”","“That’s so, in a way, of course.But from another angle—Well, let’s put it like this: I’ve been feeling much more at ease here since plague settled in.”"
"朗贝尔对此没有发表意见。他接着问：","Rambert made no comment.Then he asked: "
"“那么，怎样才能与你所说的这个组织联系上呢？”","“And how does one approach this organization, as you call it?”"
"“啊，”科塔尔回答说，“这可一点儿也不容易。请跟我来。”","“Ah,” Cottard replied, “that’s none too easy.Come with me.”"
"这时已是下午四点。天气闷热，城里的温度越来越高，都快要达到沸点了。周围没有行人，所有的店铺都关门了。科塔尔和朗贝尔沿着拱廊默默地走了一段路。可以说，这是一天中鼠疫遁形的时刻。万物失色，无人走动，一片寂静，也许是因为瘟疫，抑或是因为炎炎夏日，而这沉闷的空气，说不出是由于鼠疫的威胁，还是灰尘和闷热所致。人们必须仔细观察并思考一番才能意识到鼠疫的存在。因为它的存在只有通过一些反面的迹象才显露出来。也正因为这一点，那位喜欢鼠疫的科塔尔，提醒朗贝尔注意狗已绝迹了。在平时，它们本该趴在门口的阴影里，喘着气，想要找块难得的阴凉之处。他们走过棕榈大街，穿过武器广场，接着朝码头方向走去。左边有一家漆成绿色的咖啡馆，门前的人行道上支着一个大大的黄色的粗帆布遮阳蓬。科塔尔与朗贝尔一边擦着额头，一边走了进去。里面有几张被漆成绿色的铁皮桌，还有些折叠椅。屋子里空无一人，苍蝇在空中嗡嗡地飞来飞去。柜台上放着一个黄色鸟笼，里面有只鹦鹉耷拉着羽毛，无精打采地蹲在架子上。墙上挂着的几幅陈旧的战争画上布满了灰尘和蜘蛛网。所有的桌子上都有些干鸟粪，朗贝尔身旁的这张桌子也不例外，他正为此感到纳闷时，有只漂亮的公鸡拍打着翅膀，从它藏身的黑暗角落里跳了出来。","It was four in the afternoon.The town was warming up to boiling-point under a sultry sky.Nobody was about, all shops were shuttered.Cottard and Rambert walked some distance without speaking, under the arcades.This was an hour of the day when the plague lay low, so to speak; the silence, the extinction of all color and movement, might have been due as much to the fierce sunlight as to the epidemic, and there was no telling if the air was heavy with menace or merely with dust and heat.You had to look closely and take thought to realize that plague was here.For it betrayed its presence only by negative signs.Thus Cottard, who had affinities with it, drew Rambert’s attention to the absence of the dogs that in normal times would have been seen sprawling in the shadow of the doorways, panting, trying to find a nonexistent patch of coolness.They went along the boulevard des Palmiers, crossed the Place d’Armes, and then turned down toward the docks.On the left was a cafe painted green, with a wide awning of coarse yellow canvas projecting over the sidewalk.Cottard and Rambert wiped their brows on entering.There were some small iron tables, also painted green, and folding chairs.The room was empty, the air humming with flies; in a yellow cage on the bar a parrot squatted on its perch, all its feathers drooping.Some old pictures of military scenes, covered with grime and cobwebs, adorned the walls.On the tables, including that at which Rambert was sitting, bird-droppings were drying, and he was puzzled whence they came until, after some wing-flappings, a handsome cock came hopping out of his retreat in a dark corner."
"这时气温似乎又上升了几度。科塔尔脱去上衣，砰砰地敲了敲桌面。一个系着蓝色长围裙的矮个子男人从屋后深处的一扇门里走了出来，大声地向科塔尔打着招呼，同时猛地一脚踹开了那只公鸡，走到桌前来。为了盖过公鸡发出的愤怒的咯咯声，他高声问这两位绅士想要喝点什么。科塔尔要了杯白葡萄酒，接着问：“加西亚在哪里？”矮子回答说他好几天都没来这家咖啡馆了。","Just then the heat seemed to rise several degrees more.Cottard took off his coat and banged on the table-top.A very small man wearing a long blue apron that came nearly to his neck emerged from a doorway at the back, shouted a greeting to Cottard, and, vigorously kicking the cock out of his way, came up to the table.Raising his voice to drown the cock’s indignant cacklings, he asked what the gentlemen would like.Cottard ordered white wine and asked: “Where’s Garcia?”The dwarf replied that he’d not shown up at the cafe for several days."
"“你认为今晚他会来吗？”","“Think he’ll come this evening?”"
"“嗯，这我不清楚——但你知道他通常几点过来，对吧？”","“Well, I ain’t in his secrets—but you know when he usually comes, don’t you?”"
"“对。事实上，也没什么要紧的事，我只是想介绍一位朋友给他。”","“Yes.Really, it’s nothing very urgent; I only want him to know this friend of mine.”"
"这位服务员用他的围裙擦了擦潮湿的双手。","The barkeeper rubbed his moist hands on the front of his apron."
"“啊，那么这位先生也想做笔生意了？”","“Ah, so this gentleman’s in business too?”"
"“是的。”科塔尔说。","“Yes,” Cottard said."
"矮子大声地擤了擤鼻子。","The little man made a snuffling noise."
"“好吧。今晚再来一趟。我会打发孩子去叫他。”","“All right.Come back this evening.I’ll send the kid to warn him.”"
"离开咖啡馆后，朗贝尔问科塔尔刚才所说的生意是怎么回事。","After they had left, Rambert asked what the business in question might be."
"“怎么回事？当然是走私的事了。他们绕过城门口的岗哨，把东西运进城来。这样可以大赚一笔。”","“Why, smuggling, of course.They get the stuff in past the sentries at the gates.There’s plenty money in it.”"
"“我知道。”朗贝尔顿了顿说，“那么，我想，他们是官府里有人的吧？”","“I see.” Rambert paused for a moment, then asked: “And, I take it, they’ve friends in court?”"
"“你说得太对了！”晚上，遮阳蓬已收了起来，鹦鹉在鸟笼里唧唧喳喳地叫着，小桌旁坐满了穿着衬衣的男人们。当科塔尔走进咖啡馆时，一位男子站起身来，他穿着白衬衣，露出砖红色的胸脯，后脑勺上扣着个草帽。他的脸被太阳晒得黝黑，这人相貌平平，有一双黑色的小眼睛，一口洁白的牙齿，手上戴着两三个戒指。这人看起来三十岁左右。","“You’ve said it!”In the evening the awning was rolled up, the parrot squawking in its cage, and the small tables were surrounded by men in their shirt-sleeves.When Cottard entered, one man, with a white shirt gaping on a brick-red chest and a straw hat planted well back on his head, rose to his feet.He had a sun-tanned face, regular features, small black eyes, very white teeth, and two or three rings on his fingers.He looked about thirty."
"“你好！”他对科塔尔说，没有理会朗贝尔。“我们去吧台喝一杯吧。”","“Hi!” he said to Cottard, ignoring Rambert.“Let’s have one at the bar.”"
"他们一言不发地喝了三杯。","They drank three rounds in silence."
"“出去走走好吗？”加西亚问。","“How about a stroll?” Garcia suggested."
"他们朝港口方向走去。加西亚问他们找他办什么事情。科塔尔解释说，他把朋友朗贝尔介绍给他并非为了做生意，而只是为了他所谓的“出去一趟”。加西亚抽着烟，径直往前走。他提了几个问题，谈到朗贝尔时总是称作“他”，似乎全然没有注意到他的存在。","They walked toward the harbor.Garcia asked what he was wanted to do.Cottard explained that it wasn’t really for a deal that he wanted to introduce his friend, M. Rambert, but only for what he called a “get-away.”Puffing at his cigarette, Garcia walked straight ahead.He asked some questions, always referring to Rambert as “he” and appearing not to notice his presence."
"“他为什么想走？”","“Why does he want to go?”"
"“他老婆在法国。”","“His wife is in France.”"
"“噢！”他停顿了一会儿，接着问：“他做什么工作？”","“Ah!”After a short pause he added: “What’s his job?”"
"“他是个记者。”","“He’s a journalist.”"
"“是吗？记者们话多。”","“Is he, now?Journalists have long tongues.”"
"“我告诉过你的，他是我朋友。”科塔尔说。","“I told you he’s a friend of mine,” Cottard replied."
"他们默默地继续往前走着，快要走到码头了，前面有大栅栏挡住了去路。他们转身朝一家小酒馆走去，那里传来一股油炸沙丁鱼的味道。","They walked on in silence until they were near the wharves, which were now railed off.Then they turned in the direction of a small tavern from which came a smell of fried sardines."
"“不管怎样，”加西亚总结说，“这事我办不到。拉乌尔才是你要找的人。而我得设法与他取得联系。这一点也不好办。”","“In any case,” Garcia said finally, “it’s not up my alley.Raoul’s your man.And I’ll have to get in touch with him.It’s none too easy.”"
"“真的吗？”科塔尔饶有兴趣地问，“他藏起来了，是吗？”","“That so?” Cottard sounded interested.“He’s lying low, is he?”"
"加西亚没有回答。到了酒馆门口，他停下来第一次直接对朗贝尔说，“后天，十一点，城北海关营房拐角处见。”他作出一副要走的样子，又似乎突然想到了什么。“这是要花钱的，你知道。”他说话的语气非常随意。","Garcia made no answer.At the door of the tavern he halted and for the first time addressed Rambert directly.“The day after tomorrow, at eleven, at the corner of the customs barracks in the upper town.”He made as if to go, then seemed to have an afterthought.“It’s going to cost something, you know.” He made the observation in a quite casual tone."
"朗贝尔点点头说，“那当然。”","Rambert nodded.“Naturally.”"
"在回去的路上，记者向科塔尔表示感谢。","On the way back the journalist thanked Cottard."
"“没关系，老伙计。我很乐意为你效劳。而且，你是记者，有朝一日你一定会为我说好话的。”","“Don’t mention it, old chap.I’m only too glad to help you.And then, you’re a journalist, I dare say you’ll put in a word for me one day or another.”"
"两天后，朗贝尔和科塔尔登上通往城北高地、没有树阴遮挡的大街。住着海关官员的营房有一部分改成了医院，有许多人站在大门外，其中有些人想获准去探视病人——这愿望不可能实现，因为医院严禁探视病人——另一些人想打听些病人的消息，而这些消息一个小时后就会过时。因此，这里总有许多人来来往往，这也许正是加西亚约朗贝尔在这里会面的原因。","Two days later Rambert and Cottard climbed the wide shadeless street leading to the upper part of the town.The barracks occupied by the customs officers had been partly transformed into a hospital, and a number of people were standing outside the main entrance, some of them hoping to be allowed to visit a patient—a futile hope, since such visits were strictly prohibited—and others to glean some news of an invalid, news that in the course of an hour would have ceased to count.For these reasons there were always a number of people and a certain amount of movement at this spot, a fact that probably accounted for its choice by Garcia for his meeting with Rambert."
"“真奇怪，”科塔尔说，“你那么想走。事实上，这里发生的事情非常有趣。”","“It puzzles me,” Cottard remarked, “why you’re so keen on going.Really, what’s happening here is extremely interesting.”"
"“对我来说并非如此，”朗贝尔回答说。","“Not to me,” Rambert replied."
"“嗯，是的，呆在这里确实有些风险。不过，你想想看，以前人们穿过热闹的大街时同样也要冒很大的风险。”正在这时，里厄的车在他们身旁停了下来。塔鲁在开车，里厄似乎处于半睡半醒的状态。他坐起来为他们作介绍。","“Well, yes, one’s running some risks, I grant you.All the same, when you come to think of it, one ran quite as much risk in the old days crossing a busy street.”Just then Rieux’s car drew up level with them.Tarrou was at the wheel, and Rieux seemed half-asleep.He roused himself to make the introductions."
"“我们彼此认识，”塔鲁说，“我们住在同一家旅馆。”他让朗贝尔搭车回市区去。","“We know each other,” Tarrou said.“We’re at the same hotel.”He then offered to drive Rambert back to the center."
"“不用了，谢谢。我们在这儿有个约会。”","“No, thanks.We’ve an appointment here.”"
"里厄盯着朗贝尔。","Rieux looked hard at Rambert."
"“是这样的。”朗贝尔说。","“Yes,” Rambert said."
"“怎么回事？”科塔尔吃惊地问，“医生也知道这事吗？”","“What’s that?” Cottard sounded surprised.“The doctor knows about it?”"
"“治安官先生来了。”塔鲁给科塔尔使眼色。","“There’s the magistrate.”Tarrou gave Cottard a warning glance."
"科塔尔脸色都变了。奥顿先生顺着大街大踏步朝他们走来，步伐轻快，却很有架势。他走到他们面前，摘下帽子。","Cottard’s look changed.M. Othon was striding down the street toward them, briskly, yet with dignity.He took off his hat as he came up with them."
"“早上好，奥顿先生，”塔鲁说。","“Good morning, Monsieur Othon,” said Tarrou."
"治安官也向坐在车里的两个人问好，又朝站在车旁的朗贝尔和科塔尔点头致意。塔鲁把科塔尔和记者介绍给治安官。治安官凝视了天空一阵子，长叹一声说，这真是段难熬的日子。","The magistrate returned the greeting of the men in the car and, turning to Rambert and Cottard, who were in the background, gave them a quiet nod.Tarrou introduced Cottard and the journalist.The magistrate gazed at the sky for a moment, sighed, and remarked that these were indeed sad times."
"“有人告诉我，塔鲁先生，”他接着说，“你在帮着做些疾病预防工作。这确实难能可贵，堪称典范。请问里厄医生，你认为疫病情况会变得更糟吗？”","“I’ve been told, Monsieur Tarrou,” he continued, “that you are helping to enforce the prophylactic measures.I need hardly say how commendable that is, a fine example.Do you think, Dr. Rieux, that the epidemic will get worse?”"
"里厄回答说希望不会如此，而治安官则说人们应该永远报有希望，因为天意是不可预测的。","Rieux replied that one could only hope it wouldn’t, and the magistrate replied that one must never lose hope, the ways of Providence were inscrutable."
"塔鲁问治安官目前的状况是否增加了他的工作量。","Tarrou asked if his work had increased as the result of present conditions."
"“情况正好相反。刑事案件中我们说的初审案例变得越来越少了。事实上，现在我的工作只不过是对严重违反新法规的案件进行预审工作。人们从来没有像现在这样遵守我们的常规法律。”","“Quite the contrary.Criminal cases of what we call the first instance are growing rarer.In fact, almost my only work just now is holding inquiries into more serious breaches of the new regulations.Our ordinary laws have never been so well respected.”"
"“那是因为，相比而言，这些法律确实显得更好些。”塔鲁评论道。","“That’s because, by contrast, they necessarily appear good ones,” Tarrou observed."
"治安官先生似乎一直都在仰望着天空，这会儿却一改若有所思的样子，两眼盯着塔鲁。","The magistrate, who seemed unable to take his gaze off the sky, abruptly dropped his mildly meditative air and stared at Tarrou."
"“那有什么关系？重要的不是法律，而是判决。我们都得接受这一事实。”","“What does that matter?It’s not the law that counts, it’s the sentence.And that is something we must all accept.”"
"“那个家伙，”塔鲁在治安官走远之后说，“是头号敌人。”","“That fellow,” said Tarrou when the magistrate was out of hearing, “is Enemy Number One.”"
"他发动了汽车。","He pressed the starter."
"几分钟后，朗贝尔和科塔尔看见加西亚走过来了。他径直朝他们走过来，没做其他任何表示，只说了句“你们得等一等”作为招呼。他们周围有一群人鸦雀无声地站着，其中大多数是妇女。几乎所有人都带着包裹；她们妄想着能把这些东西偷偷送到她们生病的亲人手中，甚至奢望着她们的亲人能品尝到她们带来的食品。大门由全副武装的哨兵把守着，从营房和大门之间的院子里不时传来怪叫声。每到此时，人们便焦虑不安地朝病房张望。","Some minutes later Rambert and Cottard saw Garcia approaching.Without making any sign of recognition he came straight up to them and, by way of greeting, said: “You’ll have to wait a bit.”There was complete silence in the crowd around them, most of whom were women.Nearly all were carrying parcels; they had the vain hope of somehow smuggling these in to their sick relatives, and the even crazier idea that the latter could eat the food they’d brought.The gate was guarded by armed sentries, and now and then an eerie cry resounded in the courtyard between the barrack rooms and the entrance.Whenever this happened, anxious eyes turned toward the sick-wards."
"三人正在观看着这一场景，突然身后传来清脆的一声“早上好”，他们不由得回过头去。尽管天很热，拉乌尔仍然身穿一套剪裁精良的黑色西服，头戴一顶卷边的呢帽。他个子很高，身体强壮，但脸色有点苍白。他嘴唇微张，快速而清晰地说：","The three men were watching the scene when a brisk “Good morning” from behind them made them swing round.In spite of the heat Raoul was wearing a well-cut dark suit and a felt hat with rolled-up brim.He was tall and strongly built, his face rather pale.Hardly moving his lips, he said quickly and clearly: "
"“我们到市区去。你，加西亚，不必跟去。”","“Let’s walk down to the center.You, Garcia, needn’t come.”"
"加西亚点了根烟，站在原地看着他们走开。朗贝尔和科塔尔跟着夹在两人之间的拉乌尔，快步朝前走去。","Garcia lit a cigarette and remained there while they walked away.Placing himself between Rambert and Cottard, Raoul set the pace, a fast one."
"“加西亚已经说明了情况，”拉乌尔说，“我们可以办到。但我必须告诉你，这要花费你整整一万法郎。”","“Garcia’s explained the situation,” he said.“We can fix it.But I must warn you it’ll cost you a cool ten thousand.”"
"朗贝尔说他可以答应这条件。","Rambert said he agreed to these terms."
"“明天到码头附近的西班牙饭店同我一起吃顿午餐。”朗贝尔说：“好的。”这时拉乌尔与他握手道别，第一次露出笑容。拉乌尔走后，科塔尔说他第二天有事，不能一起去吃午餐，反正朗贝尔也不再需要他了。","“Lunch with me tomorrow at the Spanish restaurant near the docks.”Rambert said: “Right,” and Raoul shook his hand, smiling for the first time.After he had gone, Cottard said he wouldn’t be able to come to lunch next day, as he had an engagement, but anyhow Rambert didn’t need him any more."
"第二天，当朗贝尔走进西班牙饭店时，所有人都掉过头来盯着他看。这家昏暗的、地下室似的饭店位于黄色小街低处，光顾这里的都是些男人，从外表上看大多数是西班牙人。拉乌尔坐在店堂尽头的一张桌子旁。他向记者招手示意，于是朗贝尔朝他走了过去，其他人也收起脸上好奇的神色，重新低头就餐。拉乌尔身边坐着一个瘦高个，这人长马脸，胡里拉碴的，肩膀很宽，头发稀少。他的衬衫袖子被卷了起来，露出两只长着黑毛的又细又长的胳膊。向他介绍朗贝尔时，他缓缓地点了三下头。但拉乌尔没有介绍他的名字，总是以“我们的朋友”来称呼他。","When next day Rambert entered the Spanish restaurant, everyone turned and stared at him.The dark, cellarlike room, below the level of the small yellow street, was patronized only by men, mostly Spaniards, judging by their looks.Raoul was sitting at a table at the back of the room.Once he had beckoned to the journalist and Rambert started to go toward him, the curiosity left the faces of others and they bent over their plates again.Raoul had beside him a tall, thin, ill-shaven man, with enormously wide shoulders, an equine face, and thinning hair.His shirtsleeves were rolled up, displaying long, skinny arms covered with black hair.When Rambert was introduced he gave three slow nods.His own name, however, was not announced and Raoul, when referring to him, always said “our friend.”"
"“我们的朋友认为他可以帮助你。他将——”拉乌尔突然住口，因为女服务员走过来问朗贝尔要吃什么。“他将让你联系上我们的两个朋友，他们会把你介绍给我们贿赂过的几个哨兵。但这并不意味着你可以马上行动。你得让那些哨兵来决定最佳行动时机。最简单的办法是，你在他们当中的一个人家里住上几夜；他家离城门很近。但首要的事情便是由我们的这位朋友帮你做好必要的联络；一切安排妥当之后，你再同他结算费用。”","“Our friend here thinks he may be able to help you.He is going—” Raoul broke off, as the waitress had just come to take Rambert’s order.“He is going to put you in touch with two of our friends who will introduce you to some sentries whom we’ve squared.But that doesn’t mean you can start right away.You’ll have to leave it to the sentries to decide on the best moment.The simplest thing will be for you to stay some nights with one of them; his home is quite near the gate.The first thing is for our friend here to give you the contacts needed; then when everything’s set, you’ll settle with him for the expenses.”"
"这位“朋友”再次缓缓地点点他的马头，仍然大口大口地咀嚼着塞进嘴里的西红柿凉拌甘椒色拉。之后，他开口说话了，带点儿西班牙口音。他约朗贝尔同他见面，时间定在两天后的早上八点，地点在教堂门廊。","Again the “friend” slowly moved his equine head up and down, without ceasing to munch the tomato and pimento salad he was shoveling into his mouth.After which he began to speak, with a slight Spanish accent.He asked Rambert to meet him, the next day but one, at eight in the morning, in the Cathedral porch."
"“又要等两天。”朗贝尔说。","“Another two days’ wait,” Rambert observed."
"“你看，这事不那么容易，”拉乌尔说，“他们得找人。”","“It ain’t so easy as all that, you see,” Raoul said.“Them boys take some finding.”"
"这个马脸再次缓缓地点头表示赞同。接下来有段时间大家不知该谈些什么。等朗贝尔发现这个马脸是个热情的足球运动员时，问题也就迎刃而解了。他自己也非常喜欢足球。他们谈论法国足球锦标赛、英国职业球队的功绩及传球技巧。午餐结束时，这个马脸兴致很高，也很幽默，把朗贝尔称作“老兄”，并要他相信足球场上中卫的作用是最重要的。“你看，老兄，中卫是最重要的位置了。这是整场比赛的关键，不是吗？”朗贝尔乐于接受这种说法，尽管他本人一直都是踢中锋的。他们友好地讨论着，直到广播响起。播放了好几支抒情歌曲之后，开始播报说前一天有一百三十七人死于鼠疫。在场的人全都毫无表情。这个马脸只是耸耸肩，然后站起身来。拉乌尔和朗贝尔跟着也站了起来。","Horse-face nodded slow approval once more.Some time was spent looking for a subject of conversation.The problem was solved easily enough when Rambert discovered that horse-face was an ardent football-player.He, too, had been very keen on soccer.They discussed the French championship, the merits of professional English teams, and the technique of passing.By the end of the meal horse-face was in high good humor, was calling Rambert “old boy,” and trying to convince him that the most sporting position by far on the football field was that of center half.“You see, old boy, it’s the center half that does the placing.And that’s the whole art of the game, isn’t it?”Rambert was inclined to agree, though he, personally, had always played center forward.The discussion proceeded peacefully until a radio was turned on and, after at first emitting a series of sentimental songs, broke into the announcement that there had been a hundred and thirty-seven plague deaths on the previous day.No one present betrayed the least emotion.Horse-face merely shrugged and stood up.Raoul and Rambert followed his example."
"出门时，这个中卫使劲地握着朗贝尔的手。“我叫冈萨雷斯。”他说。在朗贝尔看来，接下来的这两天似乎看不到尽头。他找到里厄，向他讲述了事情的最新进展，接着又陪医生去一位病人家出诊。走到一个可能患有鼠疫正等着医生到来的病人家门口时，朗贝尔与里厄道别。大厅里传来一阵脚步声和说话声，有人告诉病人家属说医生来了。","As they were going out, the center half shook Rambert’s hand vigorously.“My name’s Gonzales,” he said.To Rambert the next two days seemed endless.He looked up Rieux and described to him the latest developments, then accompanied the doctor on one of his calls.He took leave of him on the doorstep of a house where a patient, suspected to have plague, was awaiting him.There was a sound of footsteps and voices in the hall; the family were being warned of the doctor’s visit."
"“希望塔鲁能准时赶过来。”里厄低声说。他看起来已经筋疲力尽。","“I hope Tarrou will be on time,” Rieux murmured.He looked worn out."
"“疫情已经失控了吗？”朗贝尔问。","“Is the epidemic getting out of hand?” Rambert asked."
"里厄说情况并非如此；事实上，死亡数据统计表上的曲线已上升得慢了一些。只是他们对付鼠疫的办法还不够多。","Rieux said it wasn’t that; indeed, the death-graph was rising less steeply.Only they lacked adequate means of coping with the disease."
"“我们设备不足。在世界上所有的军队中，装备上的不足通常用人力来弥补。但我们连人力也不足。”","“We’re short of equipment.In all the armies of the world a shortage of equipment is usually compensated for by manpower.But we’re short of man-power, too.”"
"“不是已经从外地调派来一些医生和助手吗？”","“Haven’t doctors and trained assistants been sent from other towns?”"
"“是的，”里厄说，“十位医生，一百位助手。听起来人数当然很多。但只够应付目前的疫情。如果事态恶化，人员将严重不足。”","“Yes,” Rieux said.“Ten doctors and a hundred helpers.That sounds a lot, no doubt.But it’s barely enough to cope with the present state of affairs.And it will be quite inadequate if things get worse.”"
"朗贝尔听着屋里的声响，扭头朝里厄友好地笑了笑。","Rambert, who had been listening to the sounds within the house, turned to Rieux with a friendly smile."
"“对，”他说，“你最好要快些打赢这一仗。”接着，他的脸上掠过了一层阴影。“你知道，”他低声说，“我并不是为了那事才要走的。”","“Yes,” he said, “you’d better make haste to win your battle.”Then a shadow crossed his face.“You know,” he added in a low tone: “it’s not because of that I’m leaving.”"
"里厄说他很清楚这一点，但朗贝尔继续说：","Rieux replied that he knew it very well, but Rambert went on to say: "
"“我认为我不是个懦夫——至少多数情况下不是。而且，我已经经受过这方面的考验。只是一想起一些事情，我就受不了。”","“I don’t think I’m a coward-not as a rule, anyhow.And I’ve had opportunities of putting it to the test.Only there are some thoughts I simply cannot endure.”"
"医生注视着朗贝尔。","The doctor looked him in the eyes."
"“你会再见到她的。”他说。","“You’ll see her again,” he said."
"“也许吧。但我一想到这种状况可能还要持续下去，而她也渐渐变老，就难以忍受。人到了三十岁就开始变老，因此必须要好好享受生活。但我不知道你能否理解。”","“Maybe.But I just can’t stomach the thought that it may last on and on, and all the time she’ll be growing older.At thirty one’s beginning to age, and one’s got to squeeze all one can out of life.But I doubt if you can understand.”"
"里厄回答说他能理解，正在这时，塔鲁走了过来，看起来很兴奋。","Rieux was replying that he thought he could, when Tarrou came up, obviously much excited."
"“我刚才去邀请帕纳卢来加入我们的队伍。”","“I’ve just asked Paneloux to join us.”"
"“是吗？”医生问。","“Well?” asked the doctor."
"“他考虑了一下，答应了。”","“He thought it over, then said yes.”"
"“太好了，”医生说，“我很高兴他本人比他的布道更好。”","“That’s good,” the doctor said.“I’m glad to know he’s better than his sermon.”"
"“大多数人都是这样，”塔鲁回答说，“只是要给他们机会。”他微笑着朝里厄眨了眨眼。“这就是我这辈子要做的工作——给人创造机会。”","“Most people are like that,” Tarrou replied.“It’s only a matter of giving them the chance.”He smiled and winked at Rieux.“That’s my job in life—giving people chances.”"
"“对不起，”朗贝尔说，“我得走了。”","“Excuse me,” Rambert said, “I’ve got to be off.”"
"在约定好的星期四那天八点差五分，朗贝尔来到了教堂门廊下。天气还比较凉爽。天空中飘浮的小云朵，它们很快就会被太阳一口吞没的。草坪虽然干枯，却在那儿隐隐散发着一股潮气。因为东面房屋的遮挡，太阳只晒到了圣女贞德像的头盔部分，而这也是教堂前广场上唯一一小块阳光照射到的地方。八点的钟声已经敲响。朗贝尔在空无一人的门廊下走了几步。从教堂里传出一阵低沉的吟诵声，伴随而来的是阵阵焚香的味道和湿气。吟诵声突然停了下来。十个矮小的黑色人影走出了教堂，快步朝市中心走去。朗贝尔变得有些不耐烦了。又有一些黑色的人影登上阶梯，进入门廊。他想点支烟，却突然想起这里可能不准吸烟。","On Thursday, the day of the appointment, Rambert entered the Cathedral porch at five minutes to eight.The air was still relatively cool.Small fleecy clouds, which presently the sun would swallow at a gulp, were drifting across the sky.A faint smell of moisture rose from the lawns, parched though they were.Still masked by the eastward houses, the sun was warming up Joan of Arc’s helmet only, and it made a solitary patch of brightness in the Cathedral square.A clock struck eight.Rambert took some steps in the empty porch.From inside came a low sound of intoning voices, together with stale wafts of incense and dank air.Then the voices ceased.Ten small black forms came out of the building and hastened away toward the center of the town.Rambert grew impatient.Other black forms climbed the steps and entered the porch.He was about to light a cigarette when it struck him that smoking might be frowned on here."
"八点一刻，管风琴开始奏响，声音非常低柔。朗贝尔走进教堂。一开始，他在教堂侧廊昏暗的光线里什么也看不见；过了一会儿，他才看出聚在教堂中殿的正是那些刚从他面前走过的黑色的身影。他们都聚在一个角落里，前面是个临时祭坛，上面放着一尊由当地的一名雕塑家匆匆赶制出来的圣罗奇雕像。他们跪在那里，甚至显得更矮了，在烟雾缭绕之中，一团团暗影和那灰蒙蒙的潮气一样，都看不清楚。在他们的上方，管风琴正在不断地变换着曲调。","At eight fifteen the organ began to play, very softly.Rambert entered.At first he could see nothing in the dim light of the aisle; after a moment he made out in the nave the small black forms that had preceded him.They were all grouped in a corner, in front of a makeshift altar on which stood a statue of St. Roch, carved in haste by one of our local sculptors.Kneeling, they looked even smaller than before, blobs of clotted darkness hardly more opaque than the gray, smoky haze in which they seemed to float.Above them the organ was playing endless variations."
"当朗贝尔走出教堂时，他看见冈萨雷斯已经走下阶梯，朝市区方向走去。","When Rambert stepped out of the Cathedral, he saw Gonzales already going down the steps on his way back to the town."
"“我以为你已经离开了，老兄，”他对记者说，“时间已经太晚了。”","“I thought you’d cleared off, old boy,” he said to the journalist.“Considering how late it is.”"
"他接着解释说，他到约定好的地点去见几位朋友——地点就在附近——本来约好在七点五十分见面，但他白白等了二十分钟。","He proceeded to explain that he’d gone to meet his friends at the place agreed on—which was quite near by—at ten to eight, the time they’d fixed, and waited twenty minutes without seeing them."
"“他们一定被什么事情耽搁了。你知道，干我们这行的会遇到许多麻烦。”","“Something must have held them up.There’s lots of snags, you know, in our line of business.”"
"他提议两人于第二天同一时间在战争纪念碑旁会面。朗贝尔叹了口气，把头上的呢帽往后一推。","He suggested another meeting at the same time on the following day, beside the war memorial.Rambert sighed and pushed his hat back on his head."
"“没关系，”冈萨雷斯大笑着说，“你想想看，球场上所有的转身、奔跑和传球就是为了射入一球。”","“Don’t take it so hard,” Gonzales laughed.“Why, think of all the swerves and runs and passes you got to make to score a goal.”"
"“的确如此，”朗贝尔说，“但一场比赛只需一个半小时。”","“Quite so,” Rambert agreed.“But the game lasts only an hour and a half.”"
"奥兰的战争纪念碑坐落在一个唯一能瞥见大海的地方，是个散步场所，不远处就是能俯瞰港口的峭壁。第二天，朗贝尔又首先来到了会面地点，看看那些为国捐躯的将士名单来打发时间。几分钟后，有两个人走上前来，随意地瞟了他一眼，然后把肘部放在护栏上，全神贯注地俯瞰着空无一人、毫无生气的港口。两人个子一样高，都穿着短袖运动衣和蓝色长裤。记者走开一些，然后坐在一条石椅上随意打量起他俩来。他们显然很年轻，不会超过二十岁。就在这时，他看见冈萨雷斯走了过来。","The war memorial at Oran stands at the one place where one has a glimpse of the sea, a sort of esplanade following for a short distance the brow of the cliff overlooking the harbor.Next day, being again the first to arrive at the meeting-place, Rambert whiled away the time reading the list of names of those who had died for their country.Some minutes later two men strolled up, gave him a casual glance, then, resting their elbows on the parapet of the esplanade, gazed down intently at the empty, lifeless harbor.Both wore short-sleeved jerseys and blue trousers, and were of much the same height.The journalist moved away and, seated on a stone bench, studied their appearance at leisure.They were obviously youngsters, not more than twenty.Just then he saw Gonzales coming up."
"“那就是我们的朋友。”冈萨雷斯为自己迟到道歉后说。接着他把朗贝尔领到那两个年轻人身边，介绍说他们一个叫马塞尔，一个叫路易斯。他们看起来很相像，因此朗贝尔认为他们肯定是兄弟俩。","“Those are our friends,” he said, after apologizing for being late.Then he led Rambert to the two youths, whom he introduced as Marcel and Louis.They looked so much alike that Rambert had no doubt they were brothers."
"“好了，”冈萨雷斯说，“既然你们认识了，就该谈谈正事了。”","“Right,” said Gonzales.“Now you know each other, you can get down to business.”"
"马塞尔，抑或是路易斯说，两天后轮到他们站岗，为期一周；他们得找准一个最佳的夜晚见机行事。问题是，把守西门的哨兵除他俩外，还有另外两个人，他们是职业军人。干这事最好把这两人撇开，他们是靠不住的，更何况这样还会增加不必要的开支。不过，有些晚上，这两个哨兵会去附近一家酒吧的后间呆上几个小时。马塞尔，抑或是路易斯说，朗贝尔最好呆在离城门口只有几分钟路程的他们家里，等候他们当中的一个回来通报消息。这样，他要“出去一趟”就变得很容易了。但是时间得抓紧，有传言说在城市外围要设双重岗哨。","Marcel, or Louis, said that their turn of guard duty began in two days and lasted a week; they’d have to watch out for the night when there was the best chance of bringing it off.The trouble was that there were two other sentries, regular soldiers, besides themselves, at the west gate.These two men had better be kept out of the business; one couldn’t depend on them, and anyhow it would pile up expenses unnecessarily.Some evenings, however, these two sentries spent several hours in the back room of a near-by bar.Marcel, or Louis, said that the best thing Rambert could do would be to stay at their place, which was only a few minutes’ walk from the gate, and wait till one of them came to tell him the coast was clear.It should then be quite easy for him to “make his get-away.”But there was no time to lose; there had been talk about setting up duplicate sentry posts a little farther out."
"朗贝尔表示同意，并从剩下不多的香烟中拿了几支递给这两个年轻人。两人中尚未开腔的那个问冈萨雷斯是否已谈妥费用问题，是否可以先给一笔预付款。“不，”冈萨雷斯说，“你不必这样做，他是我朋友。他离开时再支付费用。”","Rambert agreed and handed some of his few remaining cigarettes to the young men.The one who had not yet spoken asked Gonzales if the question of expenses had been settled and whether an advance would be given.“No,” Gonzales said, “and you needn’t bother about that; he’s a pal of mine.He’ll pay when he leaves.”"
"他们又约了个时间再会面。冈萨雷斯提议两天后大家到西班牙饭店一起吃顿饭。从那里很快就可以走到那两个年轻人家里。“第一天晚上，”他补充说，“我会陪着你，老兄。”","Another meeting was arranged.Gonzales suggested their dining together on the next day but one, at the Spanish restaurant.It was at easy walking-distance from where the young men lived.“For the first night,” he added, “I’ll keep you company, old boy.”"
"第二天，朗贝尔正要回房间时，恰好碰上塔鲁从旅馆的楼梯上走下来。","Next day on his way to his bedroom Rambert met Tarrou coming down the stairs at the hotel."
"“愿意跟我一起走吗？”塔鲁说，“我正要去找里厄。”","“Like to come with me?” he asked.“I’m just off to see Rieux.”"
"朗贝尔犹豫不决。","Rambert hesitated."
"“嗯，不知我会不会打扰他。”","“Well, I never feel sure I’m not disturbing him.”"
"“我想你不必多虑，他谈起过你的许多事情。”","“I don’t think you need worry about that; he’s talked about you quite a lot.”"
"记者考虑了一下。然后他说：“听我说，如果你们晚饭后有空的话，晚一点儿也没关系，你们俩为什么不来旅馆和我喝上一杯呢？”","The journalist pondered.Then, “Look here,” he said.“If you’ve any time to spare after dinner, never mind how late, why not come to the hotel, both of you, and have a drink with me?”"
"“那取决于里厄。”塔鲁以不确定的语气说。“还取决于疫情。”他又说。","“That will depend on Rieux.” Tarrou sounded doubtful.“And on the plague,” said Tarrou."
"不过，那天晚上十一点，里厄和塔鲁来到了这家旅馆又小又窄的酒吧。三十来个客人挤在那里，都在大声地交谈着。刚刚摆脱这座疫城的寂静，这两位来客被这突然的嘈杂声吓呆了，在酒吧门口停下了脚步。当他们看到这里还可以饮酒时，一切就都明白了。坐在酒吧一角的高凳上的朗贝尔向他们招手致意。他很帅气地将一个吵闹的客人推开，为他的朋友腾出些位子来。","At eleven o’clock that night, however, Rieux and Tarrou entered the small, narrow bar of the hotel.Some thirty people were crowded into it, all talking at the top of their voices.Coming from the silence of the plague-bound town, the two newcomers were startled by the sudden burst of noise, and halted in the doorway.They understood the reason for it when they saw that liquor was still to be had here.Rambert, who was perched on a stool at a corner of the bar, beckoned to them.With complete coolness he elbowed away a noisy customer beside him to make room for his friends."
"“你不讨厌喝酒吧？”","“You’ve no objection to a spot of something strong?”"
"“不，”塔鲁回答说，“恰恰相反。”","“No,” Tarrou replied.“Quite the contrary.”"
"里厄嗅了嗅朗贝尔递给他的那杯酒中的苦草味。在这样的嘈杂声中是很难进行交谈的，而朗贝尔似乎只顾着喝酒。医生不能确定他是否已经喝醉了。酒吧里除了这张半圆型的吧台之外，剩下的地方只摆得下两张桌子，其中一张桌子旁坐了一位海军军官，两边各坐着一个女人。他正在向一个红脸的胖子讲述在开罗发生的斑疹伤寒疫情。“他们有集中营，你知道，”他说，“为了当地人，搭了些帐篷来收容病人，四周布满了岗哨。假如病人家属想靠近营地要偷偷送一些该死的土方药，一旦被发现就会遭到枪击。这确实有点儿强硬，但也只能这样做。”另一张桌子上围坐着一群生气勃勃的年轻人，也听不清他们在谈些什么，声音几乎被他们头顶上方的扬声器里传出的《圣詹姆斯医院》那刺耳的旋律所淹没。","Rieux sniffed the pungency of bitter herbs in the drink that Rambert handed him.It was hard to make oneself heard in the din of voices, but Rambert seemed chiefly concerned with drinking.The doctor couldn’t make up his mind whether he was drunk yet.At one of the two tables that occupied all the remaining space beyond the half-circle round the bar, a naval officer, with a girl on each side of him, was describing to a fat, red-faced man a typhus epidemic at Cairo.“They had camps, you know,” he was saying, “for the natives, with tents for the sick ones and a ring of sentries all round.If a member of the family came along and tried to smuggle in one of those damn-fool native remedies, they fired at sight.A bit tough, I grant you, but it was the only thing to do.”At the other table, round which sat a bevy of bright young people, the talk was incomprehensible, half drowned by the stridence of St. James Infirmary corning from a loud-speaker just above their heads."
"“运气还好吗？”里厄不得不提高了嗓门。","“Any luck?” Rieux had to raise his voice."
"“我正在办，”朗贝尔回答说，“也许就在这周之内吧。”","“I’m getting on,” Rambert replied.“In the course of the week, perhaps.”"
"“太可惜了！”塔鲁叫道。","“A pity!” Tarrou shouted."
"“为什么？”","“Why?”"
"“噢，”里厄插话说，“塔鲁这样说是因为他认为你留在这儿可以帮我们的忙。不过，我自己倒是非常理解你为什么要走。”","“Oh,” Rieux put in, “Tarrou said that because he thinks you might be useful to us here.But, personally, I understand your wish to get away only too well.”"
"塔鲁又请大家喝了一杯。","Tarrou stood the next round of drinks."
"朗贝尔从他那张高凳上下来，第一次正视着塔鲁。","Rambert got off his stool and looked him in the eyes for the first time."
"“我能帮什么忙？”","“How could I be useful?”"
"“当然了，”塔鲁回答说，一边慢慢地把手伸向他的酒杯，“可以到我们的一支卫生队里来。”朗贝尔脸上又显露出他那常见的若有所思的固执的神情，重又坐回到他的高凳上。","“Why, of course,” Tarrou replied, slowly reaching toward his glass, “in one of our sanitary squads.”The look of brooding obstinacy that Rambert so often had came back to his face, and he climbed again on to his stool."
"“你不认为我们的卫生队有些用处吗？”塔鲁喝了一小口酒，死死地盯着朗贝尔问道。","“Don’t you think these squads of ours do any good?” asked Tarrou, who had just taken a sip of his glass and was gazing hard at Rambert."
"“当然有用。”记者回答说，接着将酒一饮而尽。","“I’m sure they do,” the journalist replied, and drank off his glass."
"里厄注意到朗贝尔的手在发抖，所以他断定这人已经喝过头了。","Rieux noticed that his hand was shaking, and he decided, definitely, that the man was far gone in drink."
"第二天，朗贝尔又来到了西班牙饭店，他不得不从一伙男人中间穿过去，他们已经把椅子搬到了路边，坐在暗金色的暮色中，呼吸着第一缕凉爽的空气。他们抽着一种散发着辛辣味的烟草。饭店里几乎没有人。朗贝尔走到店堂尽头的一张桌子旁坐下，他和冈萨雷斯第一次会面时就坐的这张桌子。他对女服务员说他还要等一会儿。这时已到了七点半。","Next day, when for the second time Rambert entered the Spanish restaurant, he had to make his way through a group of men who had taken chairs out on the sidewalk and were sitting in the green-gold evening light, enjoying the first breaths of cooler air.They were smoking an acrid-smelling tobacco.The restaurant itself was almost empty.Rambert went to the table at the back at which Gonzales had sat when they met for the first time.He told the waitress he would wait a bit.It was seven thirty."
"人们三三两两地从外面进到店里就坐。女服务员们开始上菜了，这家地下室般的饭店里也开始充斥着叮叮当当的刀叉声和嗡嗡的说话声。八点了，朗贝尔还在等着。灯也亮起来了。新来的一伙客人在他的桌旁坐了下来。他点了菜。八点半时，他已经吃好了饭，却还是不见冈萨雷斯和那两个年轻人的身影。他抽了几支烟。饭店里的客人越来越少了。外面，夜幕也很快降临了。从海面吹过来的一阵暖风掀动着门口悬挂的门帘。九点了，朗贝尔发现饭店里的客人已走光了，女服务员不解地看着他。他结了账，走出了饭店。看到街对面有家咖啡馆开着，他进去找了个位子坐下，在那儿他可以密切注视着饭店的入口处。到了九点半，他起身慢慢朝旅馆走去，绞尽脑汁想着与不知住处的冈萨雷斯取得联系的办法，而一想到这麻烦事很有可能又得从头开始，他就感到万分沮丧。","In twos and threes the men from outside began to dribble in and seat themselves at the tables.The waitresses started serving them, and a tinkle of knives and forks, a hum of conversation, began to fill the cellarlike room.At eight Rambert was still waiting.The lights were turned on.A new set of people took the other chairs at his table.He ordered dinner.At half past eight he had finished without having seen either Gonzales or the two young men.He smoked several cigarettes.The restaurant was gradually emptying.Outside, night was falling rapidly.The curtains hung across the doorway were billowing in a warm breeze from the sea.At nine Rambert realized that the restaurant was quite empty and the waitress was eying him curiously.He paid, went out, and, noticing that a cafe across the street was open, settled down there at a place from which he could keep an eye on the entrance of the restaurant.At half past nine he walked slowly back to his hotel, racking his brains for some method of tracking down Gonzales, whose address he did not know, and bitterly discouraged by the not unlikely prospect of having to start the tiresome business all over again."
"就是在这个时候，当他走在黑漆漆的大街上，救护车从身边疾驰而过的时候，他突然想到——正如他后来告诉里厄的那样——这段日子他几乎已经把他深爱的女人抛到了脑后，因为他一门心思想在阻隔他俩的重重障碍上打开一个缺口。但也是在这个时候，当逃离此地的一切途径再次被切断的时候，他感到内心对她的渴望又重新燃烧起来，那么突然，那么强烈。于是他开始朝旅馆跑去，仿佛是要逃离充斥在他身体里那种灼烧般的痛苦，那痛苦就如同野火一样在他的血液里奔腾。","It was at this moment, as he walked in the dark streets along which ambulances were speeding, that it suddenly struck him—as he informed Dr. Rieux subsequently—that all this time he’d practically forgotten the woman he loved, so absorbed had he been in trying to find a rift in the walls that cut him off from her.But at this same moment, now that once more all ways of escape were sealed against him, he felt his longing for her blaze up again, with a violence so sudden, so intense, that he started running to his hotel, as if to escape the burning pain that none the less pervaded him, racing like wildfire in his blood."
"而第二天一大早，他就去找里厄，问他在哪里可以找到科塔尔。","Very early next day, however, he called on Rieux, to ask him where he could find Cottard."
"“唯一要做的就是一切从头开始。”","“The only thing to do is to pick up the thread again where I dropped it.”"
"“明晚来这里吧，”里厄说，“塔鲁要我把科塔尔请过来——我也不知是为什么。他十点会过来。你十点半过来吧。”","“Come tomorrow night,” Rieux said.“Tarrou asked me to invite Cottard here—I don’t know why.He’s due to come at ten.Come at half past ten.”"
"次日，科塔尔到医生家时，塔鲁和里厄正在谈论着里厄的病人中出现了一个出人意料的治愈病例。","When Cottard visited the doctor next day, Tarrou and Rieux were discussing the case of one of Rieux’s patients who against all expectation had recovered."
"“只有十分之一的比率，”塔鲁评论道，“他运气不错。”","“It was ten to one against,” Tarrou commented.“He was in luck.”"
"“哦，好了，”科塔尔说，“他得的不是鼠疫，仅此而已。”","“Oh, come now,” Cottard said.“It can’t have been plague, that’s all.”"
"他们要他相信，这的确是个鼠疫病例。","They assured him there was no doubt it was a case of plague."
"“既然他痊愈了，就不可能是鼠疫。你们和我一样清楚，得了鼠疫就难逃厄运。”“一般来说，的确是这样的，”里厄说，“但如果不放弃，有时也会有惊喜。”","“That’s impossible, since he recovered.You know as well as I do, once you have plague your number’s up.”“True enough, as a general rule,” Rieux replied.“But if you refuse to be beaten, you have some pleasant surprises.”"
"科塔尔哈哈大笑。","Cottard laughed."
"“反正是极少数。你们知道今晚的死亡数字吗？”","“Precious few, anyhow.You saw the number of deaths this evening?”"
"塔鲁友好地看着科塔尔说，他知道最新数据，情况非常严重。但这又说明什么呢？这只说明还要采取更严厉的措施。“怎么做？你们不能采取比现在更为严厉的措施了。”","Tarrou, who was gazing amiably at Cottard, said he knew the latest figures, and that the position was extremely serious.But what did that prove?Only that still more stringent measures should be applied.“How?You can’t make more stringent ones than those we have now.”"
"“不会。但是城里的每一个人都必须身体力行。”","“No.But every person in the town must apply them to himself.”"
"科塔尔疑惑地看着塔鲁，而塔鲁则继续说，有太多的人还没有行动起来，鼠疫是大家的事，所以大家都必须承担起责任来。比如说，卫生队就欢迎任何体格健壮的人加入。","Cottard stared at him in a puzzled manner, and Tarrou went on to say that there were far too many slackers, that this plague was everybody’s business, and everyone should do his duty.For instance, any able-bodied man was welcome in the sanitary squads."
"“这是个好主意，”科塔尔说，“但没有任何用处。鼠疫执掌着大权，人们对它无能为力。”","“That’s an idea,” said Cottard, “but it won’t get you anywhere.The plague has the whip hand of you and there’s nothing to be done about it.”"
"“只有试过一切办法之后，”——塔鲁努力克制着自己的声音说——“我们才知道情况是否真是这样。”","“We shall know whether that is so”—Tarrou’s voice was carefully controlled—“only when we’ve tried everything.”"
"这时，里厄已经坐在桌旁抄写统计报告了。塔鲁还在打量着惴惴不安地坐在椅子上的小个子商人。","Meanwhile Rieux had been sitting at his desk, copying out reports.Tarrou was still gazing at the little business man, who was stirring uneasily in his chair."
"“听我说，科塔尔先生，你为什么不加入到我们的队伍中来呢？”","“Look here, Monsieur Cottard, why don’t you join us?”"
"科塔尔拿起他的礼帽，好像受到冒犯似的站了起来。","Picking up his derby hat, Cottard rose from his chair with an offended expression."
"“这不关我的事。”他说。接着，他有点逞强地说，“再说了，我很习惯鼠疫，而且我也觉得自己没有理由要去制止它。”","“It’s not my job,” he said.Then, with an air of bravado, he added: “What’s more, the plague suits me quite well and I see no reason why I should bother about trying to stop it.”"
"塔鲁拍拍自己的额头，似乎恍然大悟。","As if a new idea had just waylaid him, Tarrou struck his forehead."
"“哦，对呀，我都忘了。要不是鼠疫，你就被捕了。”","“Why, of course, I was forgetting.If it wasn’t for that, you’d be arrested.”"
"科塔尔吓了一跳，紧紧抓住椅背，好像就要摔倒了似的。里厄放下笔来，饶有兴趣地看着他。","Cottard gave a start and gripped the back of the chair, as if he were about to fall.Rieux had stopped writing and was observing him with grave interest."
"“是谁对你这样说的？”科塔尔几乎大叫道。","“Who told you that?” Cottard almost screamed."
"“哦，是你自己呀！”塔鲁有些诧异地说，“至少，医生和我是这样理解你说过的话的。”","“Why, you yourself!” Tarrou looked surprised.“At least, that’s what the doctor and I have gathered from the way you speak.”"
"科塔尔变得怒不可遏起来，嘴里不断地咒骂着。","Losing all control of himself, Cottard let out a volley of oaths."
"“请不要激动，”塔鲁平静地说，“医生和我都不会想去警察局告发你的。你干过的事情与我们毫不相干。况且，我们对警察局从未有过好感。好了！请坐下吧。”","“Don’t get excited,” Tarrou said quietly.“Neither I nor the doctor would dream of reporting you to the police.What you may have done is no business of ours.And, anyway, we’ve never had much use for the police.Come, now!Sit down again.”"
"科塔尔看看椅子，犹豫着坐了下去。他深深地叹了一口气。","Cottard looked at the chair, then hesitantly lowered himself into it.He heaved a deep sigh."
"“那是多年以前发生的事了，”他说，“不知怎的，他们又旧事重提。我本以为人们已经忘记此事了。但有人讲了出来，真该死！他们找到我，并告诉我在调查结束前不得离开。我觉得他们最终一定会逮捕我的。”","“It’s something that happened ages ago,” he began.“Somehow they’ve dug it up.I thought it had all been forgotten.But somebody started talking, damn him!They sent for me and told me not to budge till the inquiry was finished.And I felt pretty sure they’d end up by arresting me.”"
"“事情严重吗？”塔鲁问。","“Was it anything serious?”Tarrou asked."
"“这要看你怎么理解‘严重’这词了。反正这不是一件谋杀案。”","“That depends on what you mean by ‘serious.’ It wasn’t murder, anyhow.”"
"“那会判监禁还是苦役呢？”","“Prison or transportation with hard labor?”"
"科塔尔看起来几乎要绝望了。","Cottard was looking almost abject."
"“唉，监禁——假如我运气好的话。”但过了一会儿，他又激动起来。“那只是个错误。每个人都会犯错。一想到我要为此而坐牢，被迫离开亲人朋友，放弃以前的习惯，我就不能忍受。”","“Well, prison-if I’m lucky.”But after a moment he grew excited again.“It was all a mistake.Everybody makes mistakes.And I can’t bear the idea of being pulled in for that, of being torn from my home and habits and everyone I know.”"
"“就因为这个，”塔鲁问，“你才想到要上吊自杀吗？”","“And is that the reason,” Tarrou asked, “why you had the bright idea of hanging yourself?”"
"“是的。我承认这样做很傻。”","“Yes.It was a damn-fool thing to do, I admit.”"
"里厄第一次开口讲话了。他对科塔尔说，他非常理解他的担忧，但也许一切终究都会解决的。","For the first time Rieux spoke.He told Cottard that he quite understood his anxiety, but perhaps everything would come right in the end."
"“噢，目前我没什么好怕的。”","“Oh, for the moment I’ve nothing to fear.”"
"“我明白了，”塔鲁说，“你是不会加入到我们队伍中来的。”","“I can see,” Tarrou said, “that you’re not going to join in our effort.”"
"科塔尔不安地摆弄着他的帽子，目光闪烁地看着塔鲁。","Twiddling his hat uneasily, Cottard gazed at Tarrou with shifty eyes."
"“希望你不会怨我。”","“I hope you won’t bear me a grudge.”"
"“当然不会。但是”——塔鲁笑着说——“你至少不要去故意散播病菌。”","“Certainly not.But”—Tarrou smiled—“do try at least not to propagate the microbe deliberately.”"
"科塔尔辩解说，他并不希望发生鼠疫，鼠疫爆发纯属偶然，而现在鼠疫让他财运亨通，这也不能怪他。这时，朗贝尔走了进来，科塔尔似乎鼓足了勇气，有点挑衅地说：","Cottard protested that he’d never wanted the plague, it was pure chance that it had broken out, and he wasn’t to blame if it happened to make things easier for him just now.Then he seemed to pluck up courage again and when Rambert entered was shouting almost aggressively: "
"“况且，我肯定你们不会有什么进展的。”","“What’s more, I’m pretty sure you won’t get anywhere.”"
"朗贝尔失望地得知科塔尔并不知道冈萨雷斯的住址。科塔尔建议他们可以到那个小咖啡馆去候他。他们约好第二天去。当里厄表示想要及时了解事情的进展时，朗贝尔说医生和塔鲁可以在周末晚上去找他。无论多晚，他们都一定可以在他的房间里找到他。","Rambert learned to his chagrin that Cottard didn’t know where Gonzales lived; he suggested that they’d better pay mother visit to the small cafe.They made an appointment for the following day.When Rieux gave him to understand that he’d like to be kept posted, Rambert proposed that he and Tarrou should look him up one night at the end of the week.They could come as late as they liked and would be sure to find him in his room."
"第二天早上，科塔尔和朗贝尔到了咖啡馆，给加西亚留了口信，约他当天晚上见面，如有不便，则在次日晚上见面。他们白等了一晚。第二天，加西亚才露面。他静静地倾听着朗贝尔的述说，接着他对朗贝尔说，他不清楚发生了什么事，但他知道城里有些地区已实行二十四小时警戒，挨家挨户进行核查。冈萨雷斯和那两个年轻人很可能无法通过警戒线。他所能做的莫过于让他们重新与拉乌尔取得联系。这当然不可能在两天内办妥。","Next morning Cottard and Rambert went to the cafe and left a message for Garcia, asking him to come that evening, or if this could not be managed, next day.They waited for him in vain that evening.Next day Garcia turned up.He listened in silence to what Rambert had to say; then informed him he had no idea what had happened, but knew that several districts of the town had been isolated for twenty-four hours for a house-to-house inspection.Quite possibly Gonzales and the two youngsters hadn’t been able to get through the cordon.All he could do was to put them in touch once more with Raoul.Naturally this couldn’t be done before the next day but one."
"“我明白了，”朗贝尔说，“一切都得从头来过，从零开始。”","“I see,” Rambert said.“I’ll have to start it all over again, from scratch.”"
"就在第二天，拉乌尔在街角碰到朗贝尔，证实了加西亚的猜测。事实上，城市外围地区四周已经拉起了警戒线。接下来必须设法与冈萨雷斯取得联系。两天后，朗贝尔与那个足球队员共进了午餐。","On the next day but one, Raoul, whom Rambert met at a street corner, confirmed Garcia’s surmise; the lowlying districts had, in fact, been isolated and a cordon put round them.The next thing was to get in contact with Gonzales.Two days later Rambert was lunching with the footballer."
"“真是太傻了，”冈萨雷斯说，“当然，你们本该计划好碰头的办法。”","“It’s too damn silly,” Gonzales said.“Of course you should have arranged some way of seeing each other.”"
"朗贝尔表示极为赞同。","Rambert heartily agreed."
"“明天早上，”冈萨雷斯说，“我们会找到那两个小家伙，设法真正行动起来。”","“Tomorrow morning,” Gonzales continued, “we’ll look up the kids and try to get a real move on.”"
"但是，他们次日登门拜访时，两个人都不在家。他们留了张条，约定第二天中午在中学外会面。朗贝尔回到旅馆时，他的表情引起了塔鲁的注意。","When they called next day, however, the youngsters were out.A note was left fixing a meeting for the following day at noon, outside the high school.When Rambert came back to his hotel, Tarrou was struck by the look on his face."
"“感觉不舒服吗？”塔鲁问。","“Not feeling well?” he asked."
"“一切又得从头开始，这令我感到沮丧。”接着，他又说：“你们今晚过来，对吧？”当晚，两个朋友走进朗贝尔的房间时，发现他正躺在床上。他立刻起来，往准备好的杯子里倒满了酒。在端起酒杯往唇边送之前，里厄问他事情是否有进展。记者回答说，他把所有环节又从头至尾干了一遍，已做到与先前相同的程度，一两天之后他将去赴最后一次约会。接着，他喝了一口酒，满脸忧郁地说：“不用说，他们不会露面的。”","“It’s having to start it all over again that’s got me down.”Then he added: “You’ll come tonight, won’t you?”When the two friends entered Rambert’s room that night, they found him lying on the bed.He got up at once and filled the glasses he had ready.Before lifting his to his lips, Rieux asked him if he was making progress.The journalist replied that he’d started the same round again and got to the same point as Before; in a day or two he was to have his last appointment.Then he took a sip of his drink and added gloomily: “Needless to say, they won’t turn up.”"
"“得了！他们不会再令你失望的。”","“Oh come!That doesn’t follow because they let you down last time.”"
"“你们还不懂吗？”朗贝尔耸了耸肩，带着点蔑视的神情问道。","“So you haven’t understood yet?” Rambert shrugged his shoulders almost scornfully."
"“不懂什么？”","“Understood what?”"
"“鼠疫。”","“The plague.”"
"“啊！”里厄叫了起来。","“Ah!” Rieux exclaimed."
"“是的，你们还不懂，鼠疫就意味着要一遍一遍从头来过。”","“No, you haven’t understood that it means exactly that-the same thing over and over and over again.”"
"他走到房间的一个角落里，打开一台小型留声机。","He went to a corner of the room and started a small phonograph."
"“这是什么唱片？”塔鲁说，“听上去耳熟。”","“What’s that record?” Tarrou asked.“I’ve heard it before.”"
"“是《圣詹姆斯医院》”","“It’s St. James Infirmary.”"
"在播放唱片的时候，远处传来了两声枪响。","While the phonograph was playing, two shots rang out in the distance."
"“不是条狗就是个逃犯。”塔鲁说。","“A dog or a get-away,” Tarrou remarked."
"过了一会儿，唱片放完了，救护车响着警报呼啸着从窗口下经过，声音逐渐减弱，直至完全消失。","When, a moment later, the record ended, an ambulance bell could be heard clanging past under the window and receding into silence."
"“这张唱片听起来真没劲的，”朗贝尔说，“我今天已经听了得有十遍了。”","“Rather a boring record,” Rambert remarked.“And this must be the tenth time I’ve put it on today.”"
"“你真的很喜欢它吗？”","“Are you really so fond of it?”"
"“不，但这是我仅有的一张唱片。”过了一会儿，他又说，“一切还得从头来过，这——才是问题所在。”","“No, but it’s the only one I have.”And after a moment he added: “That’s what I said ‘it’ was—the same thing over and over again.”"
"他问里厄，卫生队工作进展如何。里厄回答说现在有五个卫生队在开展工作，希望再组织一些。记者坐在床边，似乎在打量着自己的指甲。里厄注视着记者蜷曲在床边的又矮又壮的身形。","He asked Rieux how the sanitary groups were functioning.Five teams were now at work, and it was hoped to form others.Sitting on the bed, the journalist seemed to be studying his fingernails.Rieux was gazing at his squat, powerfully built form, hunched up on the edge of the bed."
"他突然发现朗贝尔也在看着他。","Suddenly he realized that Rambert was returning his gaze."
"“你知道，医生，我对你们的工作想过很多。我没有和你们一起工作是有我的理由的。不过，我认为并不是因为我怕再冒生命危险。我曾经参加过西班牙内战。”","“You know, doctor, I’ve given a lot of thought to your campaign.And if I’m not with you, I have my reasons.No, I don’t think it’s that I’m afraid to risk my skin again.I took part in the Spanish Civil War.”"
"“在哪一边？”塔鲁问。","“On which side?” Tarrou asked."
"“失败的这边。但从那时起，我思考了很多。”","“The losing side.But since then I’ve done a bit of thinking.”"
"“思考什么？”","“About what?”"
"“勇气。我现在明白，人是能作出壮举的。但如果他没有一种高尚的情感的话，那我对他也不感兴趣。”","“Courage.I know now that man is capable of great deeds.But if he isn’t capable of a great emotion, well, he leaves me cold.”"
"“有人认为人是能做任何事情的。”塔鲁说。","“One has the idea that he is capable of everything,” Tarrou remarked."
"“我不这样认为。人不能长期受苦，也不能长期感到幸福。这就意味着人做不出任何有价值的事情来。”他扫视了他们一眼，接着问：“请告诉我，塔鲁，你能为爱而死吗？”","“I can’t agree; he’s incapable of suffering for a long time, or being happy for a long time.Which means that he’s incapable of anything really worth while.”He looked at the two men in turn, then asked: “Tell me, Tarrou, are you capable of dying for love?”"
"“我不知道，但我想大概不会——就像我现在一样。”","“I couldn’t say, but I hardly think so—as I am now.”"
"“对。但你能为理想而死，这是有目共睹的。不过，我自己看过太多为理想而死的人。我不相信英雄主义，我知道这并不难，但我也知道这是会死人的。我感兴趣的是，为所爱的人而生，为所爱的人而死。”","“You see.But you’re capable of dying for an idea; one can see that right away.Well, personally, I’ve seen enough of people who die for an idea.I don’t believe in heroism; I know it’s easy and I’ve learned it can be murderous.What interests me is living and dying for what one loves.”"
"里厄一直在聚精会神地看着记者。他看着朗贝尔，静静地说道：","Rieux had been watching the journalist attentively.With his eyes still on him he said quietly: "
"“人不是一种思想，朗贝尔。”","“Man isn’t an idea, Rambert.”"
"朗贝尔从床上跳起来，激动得脸色通红。","Rambert sprang off the bed, his face ablaze with passion."
"“人就是一种思想，而且，一旦脱离了爱情，人就是一种为时极短的思想。这是我的观点。我们——人类——已经丧失了爱的能力。我们必须面对现实，医生。让我们等待着重获这种爱的能力，如果真的不行，那就等待着爱重新回到大家的身边，不必去装什么英雄。当然，我认为自己没有什么高见。”","“Man is an idea, and a precious small idea, once he turns his back on love.And that’s my point; we—mankind—have lost the capacity for love.We must face that fact, doctor.Let’s wait to acquire that capacity or, if really it’s beyond us, wait for the deliverance that will come to each of us anyway, without his playing the hero.Personally, I look no farther.”"
"里厄站起身来。他突然觉得很疲惫。","Rieux rose.He suddenly appeared very tired."
"“你说得对，朗贝尔，说得很对，我一点儿也不想叫你放弃你想做的事情；在我看来，你的事是完全正确而合理的。但是，我必须告诉你一件事：这一切并非是英雄主义。这是人的本分。这种想法可能令人发笑，但是克服鼠疫的唯一办法就是——做好本分。”","“You’re right, Rambert, quite right, and for nothing in the world would I try to dissuade you from what you’re going to do; it seems to me absolutely right and proper.However, there’s one thing I must tell you: there’s no question of heroism in all this.It’s a matter of common decency.That’s an idea which may make some people smile, but the only means of righting a plague is—common decency.”"
"“你说的‘本分’是什么意思？”朗贝尔严肃地问道。","“What do you mean by ‘common decency’?” Rambert’s tone was grave."
"“我不知道别人怎么理解。就我而言，我知道它的意思就是做好我的本职工作。”","“I don’t know what it means for other people.But in my case I know that it consists in doing my job.”"
"“你的工作！但愿我清楚我的工作是什么！”朗贝尔不无讽刺地说，“我把爱情放在首位，也许我完全错了。”","“Your job!I only wish I were sure what my job is!”There was a mordant edge to Rambert’s voice.“Maybe I’m all wrong in putting love first.”"
"里厄注视着他。","Rieux looked him in the eyes."
"“不，”他猛地说，“你没有错。”","“No,” he said vehemently, “you are not wrong.”"
"朗贝尔若有所思地看着他们。","Rambert gazed thoughtfully at them."
"“你们二位，”他说，“我认为你们在这一切活动中是不会失去什么的。在正路上走总是要容易些。”","“You two,” he said, “I suppose you’ve nothing to lose in all this.It’s easier, that way, to be on the side of the angels.”"
"里厄端起酒杯一饮而尽。","Rieux drained his glass."
"“走吧，”他对塔鲁说，“我们还有事情要做。”","“Come along,” he said to Tarrou.“We’ve work to do.”"
"医生走了出去。","He went out."
"塔鲁跟了过去，快到门口时，他却似乎改变了主意。他停了下来，回头看着记者。","Tarrou followed, but seemed to change his mind when he reached the door.He stopped and looked at the journalist."
"“我想你并不知道里厄的妻子在一家一百英里开外的疗养院里。”","“I suppose you don’t know that Rieux’s wife is in a sanatorium, a hundred miles or so away.”"
"朗贝尔显得很惊讶，正要说些什么，但塔鲁已经走出去了。","Rambert showed surprise and began to say something; but Tarrou had already left the room."
"第二天一大早，朗贝尔给医生打了个电话。","At a very early hour next day Rambert rang up the doctor."
"“在我找到离开这座城市的办法之前，你会同意让我同你们一块儿工作吗？”","“Would you agree to my working with you until I find some way of getting out of the town?”"
"电话那头沉默了一会儿，接着就传来了答复。","There was a moment’s silence before the reply came."
"“当然了，朗贝尔。谢谢。”","“Certainly, Rambert.Thanks.”"
"第三部","PART III "
"第十七章","Chapter 17"
"被鼠疫囚禁的人们就这样在一周又一周的抗争中煎熬着。也有一些人，如朗贝尔，依然报有幻想，以为自己仍是自由之人，还有选择的权利。但事实上，到了这个时候，也就是八月中旬的时候，鼠疫可以说是已经吞噬了一切事物和一切人。不再有个人命运了，有的只是集体的命运，即鼠疫和鼠疫中大家的共同感受。这些感受中最强烈的就是流放和分离之感，以及由此引发的恐惧和反抗情绪。因此，笔者认为，在这个时候，在这个炎热和疫情都达到顶峰的时候，很有必要概述并举例说明一下活人的极端行为，死人的埋葬情况，以及情侣们的两地相思之苦。","Thus week by week the prisoners of plague put up what fight they could.Some, like Rambert, even contrived to fancy they were still behaving as free men and had the power of choice.But actually it would have been truer to say that by this time, mid-August, the plague had swallowed up everything and everyone.No longer were there individual destinies; only a collective destiny, made of plague and the emotions shared by all.Strongest of these emotions was the sense of exile and of deprivation, with all the crosscurrents of revolt and fear set up by these.That is why the narrator thinks this moment, registering the climax of the summer heat and the disease, the best for describing, on general lines and by way of illustration, the excesses of the living, burials of the dead, and the plight of parted lovers."
"就是在这个时候，这座疫城刮起了大风，一连刮了好几天。奥兰居民特别怕风，因为这座城市建在高原上，毫无天然屏障，所以大风可以势不可挡地横扫大街小巷。城里已经数月没有下过一滴雨了，到处都蒙上了一层灰色外衣，大风一刮，便纷纷脱落、尘土飞扬。尘土和纸屑四处回旋，打在行人的腿上，大街上也变得越来越空荡荡了。只能看到少数行人低着头，用手帕或手捂着嘴，在街上快步往前走。到了晚上，以前大家想着每一天都有可能是自己的末日，于是成群结队地聚在一起，竭力把日子拖得越长越好，现在却只能看到人们三三两两地往家赶或往喜欢的咖啡馆赶。因此，几天来，一到黄昏——一年里的这个时候黄昏来得更早些——大街上几乎空无一人，只听得见大风刺耳的呼啸声。从那看不见的、波涛汹涌的大海传过来一股盐和海藻的味道。在苍茫的夜色中，这座人迹罕见的城市笼罩在尘埃之中，充斥着海水的苦涩味，大风的呼啸声不绝于耳，就像是座被诅咒的孤岛。","It was at this time that a high wind rose and blew for several days through the plague-stricken city.Wind is particularly dreaded by the inhabitants of Oran, since the plateau on which the town is built presents no natural obstacle, and it can sweep our streets with unimpeded violence.During the months when not a drop of rain had refreshed the town, a gray crust had formed on everything, and this flaked off under the wind, disintegrating into dustclouds.What with the dust and scraps of paper whirled against people’s legs, the streets grew emptier.Those few who went out could be seen hurrying along, bent forward, with handkerchiefs or their hands pressed to their mouths.At nightfall, instead of the usual throng of people, each trying to prolong a day that might well be his last, you met only small groups hastening home or to a favorite cafe.With the result that for several days when twilight came—it fell much quicker at this time of the year—the streets were almost empty, and silent but for the long-drawn stridence of the wind.A smell of brine and seaweed came from the unseen, storm-tossed sea.And in the growing darkness the almost empty town, palled in dust, swept by bitter sea-spray, and loud with the shrilling of the wind, seemed a lost island of the damned."
"迄今为止，在人口更多、条件更差的城市郊区，死于鼠疫的人数要远远多于市中心。但是，鼠疫骤然间发起了新的一轮进攻，开始侵入了商业区。居民们将疫病的传播归咎于大风，正如旅馆经理所言“大风在散播病菌”。不管是出于何种原因，反正市中心的居民们每晚都能听到救护车叮当叮当地驶过，次数越来越频繁，就像是瘟神在他们窗前拉响了低沉而无情的警报，这时他们意识到已经轮到自己受苦了。","Hitherto the plague had found far more victims in the more thickly populated and less well-appointed outer districts than in the heart of the town.Quite suddenly, however, it launched a new attack and established itself in the business center.Residents accused the wind of carrying infection, “broadcasting germs,” as the hotel manager put it.Whatever the reason might be, people living in the central districts realized that their turn had come when each night they heard oftener and oftener the ambulances clanging past, sounding the plague’s dismal, passionless tocsin under their windows."
"当局想把疫情特别严重的地区隔离开来，除了工作上的绝对需要之外，任何人不得跨出警戒线一步。这些隔离区的居民们当然会认为这些禁令是针对他们的，因此，相比之下，他们倒是羡慕那些住在其他区的居民所享有的自由。而后者一想到还有很多人不如自己自由时，在沮丧之时也能振作起来。“不管怎样，还有比我更糟糕的人”这句话表达出了那段日子里唯一的慰藉。","The authorities had the idea of segregating certain particularly affected central areas and permitting only those whose services were indispensable to cross the cordon.Dwellers in these districts could not help regarding these regulations as a sort of taboo specially directed at themselves, and thus they came, by contrast, to envy residents in other areas their freedom.And the latter, to cheer themselves up in despondent moments, fell to picturing the lot of those others less free than themselves.“Anyhow, there are some worse off than I,” was a remark that voiced the only solace to be had in those days."
"大约在同一时期，火灾一次又一次地爆发，尤其是在西城门附近的居民区。调查发现，这些火灾是那些结束检疫隔离后回到家里的人造成的。他们因痛失亲人、过度忧虑而精神恍惚、纵火烧屋，以此幻想着自己正在以这种方式来消灭瘟神。这些火灾不断发生，使得整个地区经常处于危险之中，又加上火借风势，真是很难应付。当局试图说服那些好心的纵火犯，让他们相信官方对他们居住的房屋所采取的消毒措施能有效地消除感染的危险，但没有任何效果，于是只好颁布极为严厉的刑罚来惩治这类纵火罪。但震慑住这些不幸之人的，很可能并不是刑罚本身，而是人们的这种普遍的看法：判处监禁就等于是判处死刑，因为本市监狱中的死亡率极高。不得不承认，这样的看法是有理可循的。显而易见，鼠疫发起最猛烈攻击所选择的或是必然的对象似乎就是那些过着集体生活的人：士兵、囚犯、修道士和修女。尽管有些囚犯是单独监禁的，但监狱就像是个集体，证据就是，在本市的监狱中既有囚犯，也有看守人员死于鼠疫。鼠疫眼里没有任何值得尊敬之人，在它专横的法则之下，上至典狱长，下至最卑微的在押犯都被判了刑，而这也许是第一次在监狱里实现了绝对公平。","About the same time we had a recrudescence of outbreaks of fire, especially in the residential area near the west gate.It was found, after inquiry, that people who had returned from quarantine were responsible for these fires.Thrown off their balance by bereavement and anxiety, they were burning their houses under the odd delusion that they were killing off the plague in the holocaust.Great difficulty was experienced in fighting these fires, whose numbers and frequency exposed whole districts to constant danger, owing to the high wind.When the attempts made by the authorities to convince these well-meaning incendiaries that the official fumigation of their houses effectively removed any risk of infection had proved unavailing, it became necessary to decree very heavy penalties for this type of arson.And most likely it was not the prospect of mere imprisonment that deterred these unhappy people, but the common belief that a sentence of imprisonment was tantamount to a death sentence, owing to the very high mortality prevailing in the town jail.It must be admitted that there was some foundation for this belief.It seemed that, for obvious reasons, the plague launched its most virulent attacks on those who lived, by choice or by necessity, in groups: soldiers, prisoners, monks, and nuns.For though some prisoners are kept solitary, a prison forms a sort of community, as is proved by the fact that in our town jail the guards died of plague in the same proportion as the prisoners.The plague was no respecter of persons and under its despotic rule everyone, from the warden down to the humblest delinquent, was under sentence and, perhaps for the first time, impartial justice reigned in the prison."
"当局试图推行一种等级制度来矫正这种身份平等现象——他们想给那些在执行任务期间死亡的监狱看守人员颁发勋章——但这种想法终成泡影。由于已经颁布了戒严令，从某个角度来看，可以把这些死去的看守人员看作是现役军人，给他们追授军功章。尽管囚犯们对此毫无异议，但军界却提出强烈抗议，而且相当合乎逻辑地指出，这可能会很遗憾地使公众思想产生混乱。政府接受了这种观点，认为最简单的解决办法就是给死去的看守人员授予“抗疫勋章”。即便如此，由于不可能收回已经错发了的第一批军功章，军队仍然感到不满意。况且，抗疫勋章有它的不足之处，在精神方面所起到的作用不如军功章，因为在鼠疫期间获得这种性质的勋章简直是太容易了。这样一来，大家都不满意。","Attempts made by the authorities to redress this leveling-out by some sort of hierarchy—the idea was to confer a decoration on guards who died in the exercise of their duties—came to nothing.Since martial law had been declared and the guards might, from a certain angle, be regarded as on active service, they were awarded posthumously the military medal.But though the prisoners raised no protest, strong exception was taken in military circles, and it was pointed out, logically enough, that a most regrettable confusion in the public mind would certainly ensue.The civil authority conceded the point and decided that the simplest solution was to bestow on guards who died at their post a “plague medal.”Even so, since as regards the first recipients of the military medal the harm had been done and there was no question of withdrawing the decoration from them, the military were still dissatisfied.Moreover, the plague medal had the disadvantage of having far less moral effect than that attaching to a military award, since in time of pestilence a decoration of this sort is too easily acquired.Thus nobody was satisfied."
"另一个问题是，监狱管理不能按照修道院的程序，更不能按照军队的程序。城里两家修道院里的修道士们已经全部撤出，暂时住在虔诚的教徒家中。同样，一有机会，士兵们便一小批一小批地搬出营房，住进了学校或公共建筑里。这样，疫病显然迫使市民们在一座孤城里团结在一起，同时又使已经长期存在的团体分崩离析，使其成员回到个体的相对孤立的状态。这也使公众内心感到更加不安起来。","Another difficulty was that the jail administration could not follow the procedure adopted by the religious and, in a less degree, the military authorities.The monks in the two monasteries of the town had been evacuated and lodged for the time being with religious-minded families.In the same way, whenever possible, small bodies of men had been moved out of barracks and billeted in schools or public buildings.Thus the disease, which apparently had forced on us the solidarity of a beleaguered town, disrupted at the same time long-established communities and sent men out to live, as individuals, in relative isolation.This, too, added to the general feeling of unrest."
"事实上，人们不难想象，这些变化，加上大风，使得某些人的心里也燃起了熊熊大火。城门口频繁发生冲突，而且发动攻击者现在已是全副武装了。双方相互射击，死伤了几人，逃出城去几人。之后城门口加强了守卫，这类冲突便很快平息了下来。但这些冲突仍然足以引发一股暴动思潮，尽管影响范围并不大。那些出于卫生防疫原因而被焚或被封的房屋遭到了抢劫。不过，这些极端行为看起来不像是事先预谋好的。通常是某种偶然的刺激因素导致一些向来行为端正的人作出这些举动，并立刻有人纷纷效仿。所以，有时可以看到这样一幕：某个发狂的家伙在房主的眼皮底下冲进燃起熊熊烈焰的房子里，而痛苦的房主则呆呆地站在房子旁看着燃烧的火苗。看到房主没有反应，许多旁观者也会学着第一个人的样子冲进屋去。不一会儿，阴暗的大街上到处都是奔跑的人们，在行将熄灭的火光的映照下，他们弓着背，整个身子都变得像侏儒般矮小，肩上扛着各种物件和家具，正是这类事件迫使当局宣布实行戒严，并实施与之相关的法规。两名抢劫犯被击毙，但不知这样做是否会对他人产生很大的影响。每天都有很多人死去，处决两个人根本不能引起注意——这简直就是沧海一粟。事实上，这种场面仍在不断出现，而当局对此却表现得视而不见。似乎对民众产生些影响的唯一措施便是宵禁。从十一点开始，奥兰全城一片漆黑，就像一个大坟场。","Indeed, it can easily be imagined that these changes, combined with the high wind, also had an incendiary effect on certain minds.There were frequent attacks on the gates of the town, and the men who made them now were armed.Shots were exchanged, there were casualties, and some few got away.Then the sentry posts were reinforced, and such attempts quickly ceased.None the less, they sufficed to start a wave of revolutionary violence, though only on a small scale.Houses that had been burnt or closed by the sanitary control were looted.However, it seemed unlikely that these excesses were premeditated.Usually it was some chance incentive that led normally well-behaved people to acts which promptly had their imitators.Thus you sometimes saw a man, acting on some crazy impulse, dash into a blazing house under the eyes of its owner, who was standing by, dazed with grief, watching the flames.Seeing his indifference, many of the onlookers would follow the lead given by the first man, and presently the dark street was full of running men, changed to hunched, misshapen gnomes by the flickering glow from the dying flames and the ornaments or furniture they carried on their shoulders.It was incidents of this sort that compelled the authorities to declare martial law and enforce the regulations deriving from it.Two looters were shot, but we may doubt if this made much impression on the others; with so many deaths taking place every day, these two executions went unheeded—a mere drop in the ocean.Actually scenes of this kind continued to take place fairly often, without the authorities’ making even a show of intervening.The only regulation that seemed to have some effect on the populace was the establishment of a curfew hour.From eleven onwards, plunged in complete darkness, Oran seemed a huge necropolis."
"月夜里，长长的、笔直的街道和肮脏的、灰白色墙面呈现一片无力萧条的景象，在月色下发出微光，到处都看不到树木的影子，四周一片寂静，没有脚步声或犬吠声的打扰。这座静悄悄的城市只是一些巨大的、纹丝不动的立体建筑物的聚合，唯有默不作声的伟人铜像那石质或金属质地的面庞使人悲伤地想起他们曾经的模样。在毫无生气的广场和街道上，这些俗气的神像在阴沉的夜幕下摆出一副霸道的样子；这些不动声色的大怪物似乎象征着我们不可改变的命运，或者至少是这个死气沉沉的城市的最终命运——鼠疫、石块和黑暗已使城里的一切声音都归于沉寂。","On moonlight nights the long, straight streets and dirty white walls, nowhere darkened by the shadow of a tree, their peace untroubled by footsteps or a dog’s bark, glimmered in pale recession.The silent city was no more than an assemblage of huge, inert cubes, between which only the mute effigies of great men, carapaced in bronze, with their blank stone or metal faces, conjured up a sorry semblance of what the man had been.In lifeless squares and avenues these tawdry idols lorded it under the lowering sky; stolid monsters that might have personified the rule of immobility imposed on us, or, anyhow, its final aspect, that of a defunct city in which plague, stone, and darkness had effectively silenced every voice."
"但是，黑暗也笼罩着人们的心灵，关于埋葬情况，真相和小道消息都不可能让市民们感到安心。笔者不得不讲述一下葬礼的情况，这里要解释一下理由。他很清楚自己可能因此而受到指责，他这样做是有理由的，那就是，在这段时间里经常举行葬礼，而且在某种程度上说，他和所有的市民一样不得不关注这些埋葬事宜。无论如何，人们都不要认为笔者对此类仪式怀有一种病态的兴趣。正相反，他更感兴趣的是活人的社会，海水浴便是一个具体的例子。但是海滨浴场已经禁止入内，而且随着时间的推移，活着的人们越来越有可能终有一天要与死人为伍。这的确是明摆着的事实。当然，人们可以一直不去面对这讨厌的事实，闭上眼睛不去看它，也不去想它，但事实终究是事实，回避最终无法抵御事实。比如，当你的亲人需要安葬时，你又怎能继续对葬礼事宜置之不理呢？事实上，这里的葬礼最显著的特点就是迅速。一切程序都是被简化的，一切复杂的丧葬仪式都是被禁止的。鼠疫患者死时家人不在身边，而且守尸礼节又被禁止，因此夜间死去的病人得单独搁上一夜，而白天死去的病人则立即安葬。当然，死者家人会得到通知，但多数情况下，由于他们曾经和病人住在一起，现在正在接受检疫隔离，所以根本来不了。不过，如果死者生前没有和他的家人住在一起，他的家人就会受邀在某个固定的时间前来送葬，也就是说，他的家人会在起程前往公墓之时赶来，那时尸体已被擦洗干净并放入棺材了。","But there was darkness also in men’s hearts, and the true facts were as little calculated to reassure our townsfolk as the wild stories going round about the burials.The narrator cannot help talking about these burials, and a word of excuse is here in place.For he is well aware of the reproach that might be made him in this respect; his justification is that funerals were taking place throughout this period and, in a way, he was compelled, as indeed everybody was compelled, to give heed to them.In any case it should not be assumed that he has a morbid taste for such ceremonies; quite the contrary, he much prefers the society of the living and—to give a concrete illustration—sea-bathing.But the bathing-beaches were out of bounds and the company of the living ran a risk, increasing as the days went by, of being perforce converted into the company of the dead.That was, indeed, self-evident.True, one could always refuse to face this disagreeable fact, shut one’s eyes to it, or thrust it out of mind, but there is a terrible cogency in the self-evident; ultimately it breaks down all defenses.How, for instance, continue to ignore the funerals on the day when somebody you loved needed one?Actually the most striking feature of our funerals was their speed.Formalities had been whittled down, and, generally speaking, all elaborate ceremonial suppressed.The plague victim died away from his family and the customary vigil beside the dead body was forbidden, with the result that a person dying in the evening spent the night alone, and those who died in the daytime were promptly buried.Needless to say, the family was notified, but in most cases, since the deceased had lived with them, its members were in quarantine and thus immobilized.When, however, the deceased had not lived with his family, they were asked to attend at a fixed time; after, that is to say, the body had been washed and put in the coffin and when the journey to the cemetery was about to begin."
"我们假定这些程序都在里厄医生负责的辅助医院中进行吧。这家由学校改成的医院的主楼后面有一个出口。过道旁有间大库房，里面停放着许多灵柩。死者家人一来就可以看到走廊上有副灵柩已封了棺。接下来便是最重要的程序：家长在官方出具的表格上签字。然后灵柩被抬上汽车——一辆真正的灵车或是一辆改装过的救护车。送葬者则坐上一辆出租车——那时只有少量出租车还准许经营，于是车辆沿着城市外围的路线风驰电掣一般向公墓驶去。车辆在城门处停了一会儿，由警官在官方通行证上盖上一个戳，没有这个戳就无法获得市民们所谓的“最后的安身之地”。警察让开后，车辆往前开到一块墓地旁停了下来，那里有许多墓穴空着，等着放入灵柩。一位牧师前来迎接送葬者，因为现在不允许在葬礼上举行宗教追思仪式。伴随着祈祷声，有人将灵柩拖出灵车，绑上绳子，拖到墓穴旁，拉去绳子，再重重地将其安放到墓穴底部。牧师一开始洒圣水，第一铲土就落在了棺盖上，土屑四溅。救护车已经开走了，正在喷洒消毒水消毒，而当一铲铲土落地的声音越来越沉闷、灵柩上的土层越堆越高时，死者家人也坐上出租车匆匆离去了。一刻钟之后，他们便回到了家里。","Let us suppose that these formalities were taking place at the auxiliary hospital of which Dr. Rieux was in charge.This converted school had an exit at the back of the main building.A large storeroom giving on the corridor contained the coffins.On arrival, the family found a coffin already nailed up in the corridor.Then came the most important part of the business: the signing of official forms by the head of the family.Next the coffin was loaded on a motor-vehicle-a real hearse or a large converted ambulance.The mourners stepped into one of the few taxis still allowed to ply and the vehicles drove hell-for-leather to the cemetery by a route avoiding the center of the town.There was a halt at the gate, where police officers applied a rubber stamp to the official exit permit, without which it was impossible for our citizens to have what they called a last restingplace.The policeman stood back and the cars drew up near a plot of ground where a number of graves stood open, waiting for inmates.A priest came to meet the mourners, since church services at funerals were now prohibited.To an accompaniment of prayers the coffin was dragged from the hearse, roped up, and carried to the graveside; the ropes were slipped and it came heavily to rest at the bottom of the grave.No sooner had the priest begun to sprinkle holy water than the first sod rebounded from the lid.The ambulance had already left and was being sprayed with disinfectant, and while spadefuls of clay thudded more and more dully on the rising layer of earth, the family were bundling into the taxi.A quarter of an hour later they were back at home."
"这样的整个过程以最快的速度完成，也把危险性降至最低。不可否认，至少在最初阶段，死者家人对这种闪电式的葬礼自然感到有些气愤。但在鼠疫期间，显然无法考虑这类情绪问题。为了效率，一切都得牺牲。一开始，居民的精神因为这种简化程序而受到打击——希望举行一个“得体的葬礼”这种愿望比人们想象的还要普遍——幸好食物问题随着时间的推移变得迫切起来，于是居民将注意力转移到更迫切的需求上来。人们把大量精力都花在填表、寻找日用品和排队上，以至于根本无暇顾及周围的人们怎样死去，以及自己有朝一日将怎样离开人世。这样，日常生活中越来越大的困难本来是种折磨，结果却因祸得福。正如前面所提到的那样，要是鼠疫不再肆虐，一切本当不坏。","The whole process was put through with the maximum of speed and the minimum of risk.It cannot be denied that, anyhow in the early days, the natural feelings of the family were somewhat outraged by these lightning funerals.But obviously in time of plague such sentiments can’t be taken into account, and all was sacrificed to efficiency.And though, to start with, the morale of the population was shaken by this summary procedure—for the desire to have a “proper funeral” is more widespread than is generally believed—as time went on, fortunately enough, the food problem became more urgent and the thoughts of our townsfolk were diverted to more instant needs.So much energy was expended on filling up forms, hunting round for supplies, and lining up that people had no time to think of the manner in which others were dying around them and they themselves would die one day.Thus the growing complications of our everyday life, which might have been an affliction, proved to be a blessing in disguise.Indeed, had not the epidemic, as already mentioned, spread its ravages, all would have been for the best."
"但接下来灵柩变得越来越少了，裹尸布和公墓中的穴位也不够用了。对此得采取些措施了，而最实用的一种方法显然就是对尸体进行合葬，必要时，救护车在医院和公墓之间得多跑几趟。有段时间，在里厄工作的医院里，只剩下五个灵柩。全部装满之后，救护车将它们一起运走。到了公墓，灵柩被清空，铁青色的尸体被装在担架上，然后被放置在特设的棚子里等待下葬。与此同时，被清空的灵柩洒过灭菌液后，又被运回医院。这样的操作过程不断地重复着。这套方法运转十分有效，而且得到了省长的赞赏。他甚至对里厄说，相比史书中记载的瘟疫中由黑人拉运尸车而言，这种做法的确有了很大进步。","For then coffins became scarcer; also there was a shortage of winding-sheets, and of space in the cemetery.Something had to be done about this, and one obvious step, justified by its practical convenience, was to combine funerals and, when necessary, multiply the trips between the hospital and the burial-place.At one moment the stock of coffins in Rieux’s hospital was reduced to five.Once filled, all five were loaded together in the ambulance.At the cemetery they were emptied out and the iron-gray corpses put on stretchers and deposited in a shed reserved for that purpose, to wait their turn.Meanwhile the empty coffins, after being sprayed with antiseptic fluid, were rushed back to the hospital, and the process was repeated as often as necessary.This system worked excellently and won the approval of the Prefect.He even told Rieux that it was really a great improvement on the death-carts driven by Negroes of which one reads in accounts of former visitations of this sort."
"“是的，”里厄说，“尽管埋葬情况大致相同，但我们对此还做详细的登记。你看，这就是进步。”","“Yes,” Rieux said.“And though the burials are much the same, we keep careful records of them.That, you will agree, is progress.”"
"尽管这套方法被证实为行之有效，目前所施行的最后一项仪式却有些令人不快，因此省府不得不禁止死者亲友亲临埋葬现场。他们最多只能走到公墓门口，而官方甚至连这都不允许。原因在于，最后一项埋葬仪式已经有了些变化。在公墓的尽头，在一块种了些乳香树的空地上挖好了两个大坑。一个用来埋男尸，另一个则用来埋女尸。从这点来看，当局还是考虑了必要的礼仪的，只是后来迫于形势，这仅存的得体之举也被抛到了一边，即尸体不分男女地统统被抛入葬尸坑。所幸的是，发生这种不成体统的事情之时，鼠疫已接近尾声了。","Successful, however, as the system proved itself in practice, there was something so distasteful in the last rites as now performed that the Prefect felt constrained to forbid relations of the deceased being present at the actual interment.They were allowed to come only as far as the cemetery gates, and even that was not authorized officially.For things had somewhat changed as regards the last stage of the ceremony.In a patch of open ground dotted with lentiscus trees at the far end of the cemetery, two big pits had been dug.One was reserved for the men, the other for the women.Thus, in this respect, the authorities still gave thought to propriety and it was only later that, by the force of things, this last remnant of decorum went by the board, and men and women were flung into the death-pits indiscriminately.Happily, this ultimate indignity synchronized with the plague’s last ravages."
"我们现在要谈的是男女分坑时期的情况，那时当局对此非常重视。在两个葬尸坑的底部，厚厚一层生石灰沸腾着，冒着热气。坑边上，一堆小山似的生石灰不断往上吐着泡泡，一遇到空气便爆开了。当救护车运输完毕，担架就一字排开被抬到坑边。让赤裸的、有点扭曲变形的尸体一具接一具地滑到坑底，大致排整齐，然后洒上一层生石灰，再覆盖上一层土，土层只有几英寸厚，以便给后来者留下空间。第二天，死者的直系亲属被叫来在登记册上签字，这显示了人有别于其他狗之类的动物；人死之后会被登记在册并备案。","In the period we are now concerned with, the separation of the sexes was still in force and the authorities set great store by it.At the bottom of each pit a deep layer of quicklime steamed and seethed.On the lips of the pit a low ridge of quicklime threw up bubbles that burst in the air above it.When the ambulance had finished its trips, the stretchers were carried to the pits in Indian file.The naked, somewhat contorted bodies were slid off into the pit almost side by side, then covered with a layer of quicklime and another of earth, the latter only a few inches deep, so as to leave space for subsequent consignments.On the following day the next of kin were asked to sign the register of burials, which showed the distinction that can be made between men and, for example, dogs; men’s deaths are checked and entered up."
"所有的这些工作显然需要大量人手，而里厄常常会有人员快不够用了的感觉。一开始有许多挖埋尸坑、抬担架的这类服务人员死于鼠疫，接着又有许多志愿者丧了命。无论预防措施有多严密，迟早都会感染上。不过，话虽这么说，但真正令人惊讶的是，在整个鼠疫期间，干这些事情的人手始终不曾缺过。在疫情达到最高峰之前不久的那段日子是最危急的时期，医生感到焦虑万分是情有可原的。那时，无论是办事人员还是里厄称之为干粗活的人都极缺。但很反常的是，等到全城鼠疫肆虐之时，疫病的流行倒使人员短缺的情况有了好转，因为城里的经济活动遭到了破坏，许多人都失业了。虽然这些失业者中极少有人能胜任管理工作，但是对干粗活的人员的招收工作却变得容易多了。的确，从那时起，贫困的压力大于对死亡的恐惧，尤为重要的原因是，这项工作因要冒风险而报酬丰厚。卫生机构手上一直都有一长串申请工作的人员名单，一有缺额，就立刻通知排在名单最前面的几个人，而这些人只要还健在，就一定会应召前来工作。省长一直都在犹豫着是否要启用那些判了有期或无期徒刑的囚犯来做这项工作，这样一来，就不必采取这种讨厌的做法了。正如他所说，只要有失业人员，我们就等得起。","Obviously all these activities called for a considerable staff, and Rieux was often on the brink of a shortage.Many of the gravediggers, stretcher-bearers, and the like, public servants to begin with, and later volunteers, died of plague.However stringent the precautions, sooner or later contagion did its work.Still, when all is said and done, the really amazing thing is that, so long as the epidemic lasted, there was never any lack of men for these duties.The critical moment came just before the outbreak touched high-water mark, and the doctor had good reason for feeling anxious.There was then a real shortage of man-power both for the higher posts and for the rough work, as Rieux called it.But, paradoxically enough, once the whole town was in the grip of the disease, its very prevalence tended to make things easier, since the disorganization of the town’s economic life threw a great number of persons out of work.Few of the workers thus made available were qualified for administrative posts, but the recruiting of men for the “rough work” became much easier.From now on, indeed, poverty showed itself a stronger stimulus than fear, especially as, owing to its risks, such work was highly paid.The sanitary authorities always had a waiting-list of applicants for work; whenever there was a vacancy the men at the top of the list were notified, and unless they too had laid off work for good, they never failed to appear when summoned.Thus the Prefect, who had always been reluctant to employ the prisoners in the jail, whether short-term men or lifers, was able to avoid recourse to this distasteful measure.As long, he said, as there were unemployed, we could afford to wait."
"就这样，直到八月底，死去的市民还都能被运到他们的最后安身之地，可能礼仪上不甚周全，但至少秩序井然，而当局也感觉自己对死者及其亲友尽到了责任。不过，现在我们恐怕还得介绍一下我们采取最后措施前的这一阶段的情况。从八月开始，鼠疫造成的死亡人数不断攀升，已经大大超过了那个小公墓所能容纳的数量。推倒墓地围墙，将死者埋入邻近的土地等权宜之计仍无济于事，还得尽快另想办法。首先采取的措施便是在夜间进行埋葬工作，程序显然简化不少。救护车里堆放的尸体数量越来越多。少数夜行者在宵禁时间开始后还违规（或出于工作原因）逗留在外围地区，他们经常看到那些长长的白色救护车飞驰而过，夜幕笼罩下的大街上不断回荡着沉闷的嘟嘟的车鸣声。尸体被急急忙忙地抛入坑中，刚一到位，一铲铲的生石灰便已盖到了他们脸上，再盖上一层黄土。随着时间的推移，这些尸体便被埋葬在越来越深的坑里，谁也不晓得他们的身份。但是不久后，人们又不得不想出别的法子来拓展地盘。所采取的一项紧急措施便是将那些本已安眠于地下的尸体从墓穴里挖出来，再将这些挖出来的尸骨残骸运往火葬场焚化。不久之后，鼠疫患者的尸体也只得送去焚化了事。这样，城外东郊的旧火葬场又被重新利用了起来。东城门的岗哨因此又往外挪动了些。那时，有位市府职员提出了一个想法，极大地帮助了当局排忧解难，他建议将那些现已停用的以前在沿海公路上行驶的电车重新利用起来。于是电车的机车和拖车内部都进行了改装，一条通往火葬场的公交支线也被开通了，终点站便是火葬场。在夏季季末及整个秋季期间，人们每天都可以看到一长列奇怪的没有装载乘客的电车沿着海滩峭壁上的公路摇摇晃晃地行驶在地平线上。当地的居民很快就明白了这是怎么回事。尽管悬崖栈道上成天都有巡逻队，仍然有三三两两的人设法在路边的岩石间穿梭以掩人耳目，当电车驶过时把鲜花扔进敞开的拖车车厢中去。在炎热的夏日夜晚，这些装载着鲜花和尸体的车辆所发出的叮当声不绝于耳。","Thus until the end of August our fellow citizens could be conveyed to their last resting-place, if not under very decorous conditions, at least in a manner orderly enough for the authorities to feel that they were doing their duty by the dead and the bereaved.However, we may here anticipate a little and describe the pass to which we came in the final phase.From August onwards the plague mortality was and continued such as far to exceed the capacity of our small cemetery.Such expedients as knocking down walls and letting the dead encroach on neighboring land proved inadequate; some new method had to be evolved without delay.The first step taken was to bury the dead by night, which obviously permitted a more summary procedure.The bodies were piled into ambulances in larger and larger numbers.And the few belated wayfarers who, in defiance of the regulations, were abroad in the outlying districts after curfew hour, or whose duties took them there, often saw the long white ambulances hurtling past, making the nightbound streets reverberate with the dull clangor of their bells.The corpses were tipped pell-mell into the pits and had hardly settled into place when spadefuls of quicklime began to sear their faces and the earth covered them indisdinctively, in holes dug steadily deeper as time went on.Shortly afterwards, however, it became necessary to find new space and to strike out in a new direction.By a special urgency measure the denizens of grants in perpetuity were evicted from their graves and the exhumed remains dispatched to the crematorium.And soon the plague victims likewise had to go to a fiery end.This meant that the old crematorium east of the town, outside the gates, had to be utilized.Accordingly the east-gate sentry post was moved farther out.Then a municipal employee had an idea that greatly helped the harassed authorities; he advised them to employ the streetcar line running along the coastal road, which was now unused.So the interiors of streetcars and trailers were adapted to this new purpose, and a branch line was laid down to the crematorium, which thus became a terminus.During all the late summer and throughout the autumn there could daily be seen moving along the road skirting the cliffs above the sea a strange procession of passengerless streetcars swaying against the skyline.The residents in this area soon learned what was going on.And though the cliffs were patrolled day and night, little groups of people contrived to thread their way unseen between the rocks and would toss flowers into the open trailers as the cars went by.And in the warm darkness of the summer nights the cars could be heard clanking on their way, laden with flowers and corpses."
"开始几天，城市东区上空笼罩着一股奇臭无比的浓烟。所有的医生都认为，这种臭气虽然难闻，但没有一点害处。但是，该区居民却坚信病菌会从天而降，扬言要整体搬迁，于是当局只好特意安装一套设备以使烟雾改道，这才使居民们平静了下来。从此以后，只有在刮大风的日子里，从东边吹来一股淡淡的、令人恶心的味道时，人们才会想起生活已经完全变了样，才会想起鼠疫每晚都在吞噬着市民的生命。","During the first few days an oily, foul-smelling cloud of smoke hung low upon the eastern districts of the town.These effluvia, all the doctors agreed, though unpleasant, were not in the least harmful.However, the residents of this part of the town threatened to migrate in a body, convinced that germs were raining down on them from the sky, with the result that an elaborate apparatus for diverting the smoke had to be installed to appease them.Thereafter only when a strong wind was blowing did a faint, sickly odor coming from the east remind them that they were living under a new order and that the plague fires were taking their nightly toll."
"这就是瘟疫所造成的最严重的后果。所幸的是，疫情没有继续恶化下去，否则人们很可能会质疑管理策略、官员能力，甚至火葬场的焚尸能力是否能应付得了当前的形势。里厄知道，当局已经设想过一些极端的解决方式，比如将尸体抛入大海，他的脑海中也浮现过这样的画面：悬崖边的浅滩上歪七竖八地躺着可怕的尸骨残骸。他也清楚，如果死亡率再次上升，效率再高的组织也会束手无策：尸体将堆积如山、当街腐烂，让当局无计可施。在公共广场上，市民们将会看到垂死者怀着一种完全可以理解的仇恨或某种疯狂的渴望的心情死死地抱住活人。","Such were the consequences of the epidemic at its culminating point.Happily it grew no worse, for otherwise, it may well be believed, the resourcefulness of our administration, the competence of our officials, not to mention the burning-capacity of our crematorium, would have proved unequal to their tasks.Rieux knew that desperate solutions had been mooted, such as throwing the corpses into the sea, and a picture had risen before him of hideous jetsam lolling in the shallows under the cliffs.He knew, too, that if there was another rise in the death-rate, no organization, however efficient, could stand up to it; that men would die in heaps, and corpses rot in the street, whatever the authorities might do, and the town would see in public squares the dying embrace the living in the frenzies of an all too comprehensible hatred or some crazy hope."
"就是这些事实和担忧使得我们的市民深切地感受到流放和分离之感。在这方面，笔者很遗憾自己不能记录下这一时期真正引人注目的事情——一些像老故事中那些激动人心的英雄事迹或难以忘怀的壮举。原因在于灾难是最耸人听闻的，又因为历时长久，巨大的不幸也变得非常单调乏味。在那些经历过这场灾难的人们的记忆里，鼠疫那段可怕的日子并不像是点亮了混乱天际的、无法扑灭的熊熊烈火，贪婪至极，而更像是某种恐怖的东西，迈着缓缓的、周密计划好的步伐，所到之处，一切皆毁。","Such were the sights and apprehensions that kept alive in our townspeople their feeling of exile and separation.In this connection the narrator is well aware how regrettable is his inability to record at this point something of a really spectacular order—some heroic feat or memorable deed like those that thrill us in the chronicles of the past.The truth is that nothing is less sensational than pestilence, and by reason of their very duration great misfortunes are monotonous.In the memories of those who lived through them, the grim days of plague do not stand out like vivid flames, ravenous and inextinguishable, beaconing a troubled sky, but rather like the slow, deliberate progress of some monstrous thing crushing out all upon its path."
"不，这场真正的鼠疫与鼠疫刚爆发时萦绕在里厄心头的夸张的想象场景没有任何的共同点。鼠疫总体上说是一个狡猾的、持久不衰的对手，它有条不紊、竭尽全力地对市民发动进攻。顺便说一句：为了不歪曲事实，更为了不违背自己的想法，笔者尽力做到客观。他不会为了达到艺术效果而放弃真实，除非为了故事的连贯性才会进行一些艺术加工。正是出于这种考虑，他得承认，尽管最普遍、最深重的痛苦的根源仍是别离——他有责任更加详细地描述鼠疫后期的这种分离之感——不可否认的是，即使是这种痛苦也已不再那么强烈了。难道是我们的市民，甚至是那些深受两地相思之苦的人们，已经渐渐适应了这种没有亲人相伴的生活？这种看法可能不太正确。更确切的说法应该是，他们无论在身体上还是感情上都渐渐憔悴了。鼠疫刚开始时，他们还清晰地回忆得起不在身边的人，并苦苦思念着他们。然而，尽管心上人的音容笑貌仍萦绕心头，尽管与心上人曾经共度的快乐时光（正如他们事后回忆的）仍历历在目，在相隔如此遥远的情况下，他们根本无法想象在他们陷入回忆之时，对方可能正在做些什么。总之，这时候是记忆有余，想象力不足。在鼠疫的第二个阶段里，他们的记忆也模糊了。并不是他们已经遗忘了心上人的面容，而是——其实结果也差不多——失去了心上人的肉体，他们便再也无法在记忆的镜子中看到它了。","No, the real plague had nothing in common with the grandiose imaginings that had haunted Rieux’s mind at its outbreak.It was, about all, a shrewd, unflagging adversary; a skilled organizer, doing his work thoroughly and well.That, it may be said in passing, is why, so as not to play false to the facts, and, still more, so as not to play false to himself, the narrator has aimed at objectivity.He has made hardly any changes for the sake of artistic effect, except those elementary adjustments needed to present his narrative in a more or less coherent form.And in deference to this scruple he is constrained to admit that, though the chief source of distress, the deepest as well as the most widespread, was separation—and it is his duty to say more about it as it existed in the later stages of the plague—it cannot be denied that even this distress was coming to lose something of its poignancy.Was it that our fellow citizens, even those who had felt the parting from their loved ones most keenly, were getting used to doing without them?To assume this would fall somewhat short of the truth.It would be more correct to say that they were wasting away emotionally as well as physically.At the beginning of the plague they had a vivid recollection of the absent ones and bitterly felt their loss.But though they could clearly recall the face, the smile and voice of the beloved, and this or that occasion when (as they now saw in retrospect) they had been supremely happy, they had trouble in picturing what he or she might be doing at the moment when they conjured up these memories, in a setting so hopelessly remote.In short, at these moments memory played its part, but their imagination failed them.During the second phase of the plague their memory failed them, too.Not that they had forgotten the face itself, but—what came to the same thing—it had lost fleshly substance and they no longer saw it in memory’s mirror."
"就这样，在最初的几周时间里，他们往往还会抱怨说心上人只是个影子，慢慢地他们发现这个影子也模糊了起来，连记忆中微弱的几抹生活的色彩也褪去了。而到了最后，分离的时间久了，他们就再也无法想象他们曾经的缠绵，再也无法理解那种两个人完全粘在一起的生活了。","Thus, while during the first weeks they were apt to complain that only shadows remained to them of what their love had been and meant, they now came to learn that even shadows can waste away, losing the faint hues of life that memory may give.And by the end of their long sundering they had also lost the power of imagining the intimacy that once was theirs or understanding what it can be to live with someone whose life is wrapped up in yours."
"从这一点来看，他们已经适应了鼠疫这种状况，大家越来越能面对鼠疫中平庸的生活了。人们都不再拥有崇高的情感，大家的情感都是平凡而单调的。“鼠疫也该收场了。”人们这样说，因为身陷灾难之中，人们盼望它早点结束是很自然的，而且事实上人们也是这么想的。但人们说这话时，已经没有了鼠疫初期那种冲动与怨气，人们只是在思想处于混沌状态之时表达了那种依然萦绕心头的清晰的想法。开始几周那种强烈的反感已被一种普遍的沮丧情绪所取代，这种沮丧并非是逆来顺受，尽管这仍然可以说是对现实所作出的一种暂时的、消极的默许。","In this respect they had adapted themselves to the very condition of the plague, all the more potent for its mediocrity.None of us was capable any longer of an exalted emotion; all had trite, monotonous feelings.“It’s high time it stopped,” people would say, because in time of calamity the obvious thing is to desire its end, and in fact they wanted it to end.But when making such remarks, we felt none of the passionate yearning or fierce resentment of the early phase; we merely voiced one of the few clear ideas that lingered in the twilight of our minds.The furious revolt of the first weeks had given place to a vast despondency, not to be taken for resignation, though it was none the less a sort of passive and provisional acquiescence."
"我们的市民们已安于现状，正如人们所言，他们已经适应了这种状况，因为除此以外，别无他法。他们自然还带着一副悲伤痛苦的样子，但已经感觉不到痛苦的煎熬了。当然，有些人，就像里厄，却认为真正令人沮丧的是习惯于绝望比绝望本身还要更糟糕。在这以前，那些与心上人相隔两地的人们并非是完全不幸的；在他们痛苦的漫漫长夜里一直都透着一道希望的曙光，但现在这道曙光也已消失不见了。他们呆在大街的角落里，咖啡馆中，或是朋友家里，无精打采，心不在焉，露出厌倦的神情，整座城市也因为这些人而看起来就像是一间火车站候车室。那些有工作的人们则和着鼠疫的节拍，默默地坚持着他们的工作。每个人都不骄不躁。那些背井离乡者第一次可以用常人的语言畅所欲言地谈论他们的心上人，他们也能以看待疫情的最新统计数据那样的角度来看待别离。这种变化是很显著的，因为在这以前，他们不会将个人的不幸与全城人共同的不幸混为一谈，但现在他们认为两者是合二为一的。没有回忆，没有希望，他们活着只为了直面现实。事实上，此时此刻就意味着他们生活的全部。不可否认，鼠疫渐渐地不仅剥夺了所有人爱的能力，还有与人为善的能力。这是很自然的，因为爱情需要一些对未来的憧憬，但现在人们所面对的只有现实而已。","Our fellow citizens had fallen into line, adapted themselves, as people say, to the situation, because there was no way of doing otherwise.Naturally they retained the attitudes of sadness and suffering, but they had ceased to feel their sting.Indeed, to some, Dr. Rieux among them, this precisely was the most disheartening thing: that the habit of despair is worse than despair itself.Hitherto those who were parted had not been utterly unhappy; there was always a gleam of hope in the night of their distress; but that gleam had now died out.You could see them at street corners, in cafes or friends’ houses, listless, indifferent, and looking so bored that, because of them, the whole town seemed like a railway waiting-room.Those who had jobs went about them at the exact tempo of the plague, with dreary perseverance.Everyone was modest.For the first time exiles from those they loved had no reluctance to talk freely about them, using the same words as everybody else, and regarding their deprivation from the same angle as that from which they viewed the latest statistics of the epidemic.This change was striking since until now they had jealously withheld their personal grief from the common stock of suffering; now they accepted its inclusion.Without memories, without hope, they lived for the moment only.Indeed, the here and now had come to mean everything to them.For there is no denying that the plague had gradually killed off in all of us the faculty not of love only but even of friendship.Naturally enough, since love asks something of the future, and nothing was left us but a series of present moments."
"不过，我们所说的只是大致的情况。因此，我们必须加上一句：尽管所有的别离者最后都会达到这种境界，但在时间上也有早有晚。而且，即使他们最后变得完全漠然了，霎时的清醒，瞬间的回忆还是会给这些背井离乡之人带来新的、更强烈的痛苦。有时的确会出现这种旧创复发的状况，比如，他们在设想鼠疫结束之后的生活时就会这样。或者，有时他们会突然触景生情，莫名其妙地被一种强烈的妒忌心理所刺痛。另一些人在一周中的某些日子里会重新振奋起来，摆脱那种倦怠情绪——一般是在周日或周六下午，因为以前，当心上人还在身旁时，这段时间他们一贯会去参加某些娱乐活动。傍晚的降临，预示着往事又要在脑海里重现，这种悲伤的情绪便涌上他们的心头，不过有时也不会出现这种情况。宗教信徒进行反省的傍晚时分是囚犯和背井离乡之人最难熬的一段时间，因为他们除了内心的空虚之外别无其他可供反省的内容。这时他们心里感到空荡荡的，不一会儿，他们又重新陷入麻木不仁的境地，重新置身于鼠疫的囹圄之中。","However, this account of our predicament gives only the broad lines.Thus, while it is true that all who were parted came ultimately to this state, we must add that all did not attain it simultaneously; moreover, once this utter apathy had fallen on them, there were still flashes of lucidity, broken lights of memory that rekindled in the exiles a younger, keener sensibility.This happened when, for instance, they fell to making plans implying that the plague had ended.Or when, quite unexpectedly, by some kindly chance, they felt a twinge of jealousy, none the less acute for its objectlessness.Others, again, had sudden accesses of energy and shook off their languor on certain days of the week—for obvious reasons, on Sundays and Saturday afternoons, because these had been devoted to certain ritual pleasures in the days when the loved ones were still accessible.Sometimes the mood of melancholy that descended on them with the nightfall acted as a sort of warning, not always fulfilled, however, that old memories were floating up to the surface.That evening hour which for believers is the time to look into their consciences is hardest of all hours on the prisoner or exile who has nothing to look into but the void.For a moment it held them in suspense; then they sank back into their lethargy, the prison door had closed on them once again."
"显然，所有这些意味着要放下最关乎个人的私事。在鼠疫初期，令他们魂牵梦绕的尽是些与他人毫不相干、与己戚戚相关的私生活的点点滴滴，于是每个人的生活在那时也许是头一次显示出了那种独特性。而现在，他们开始急众人之所急，想众人之所想，他们心中的爱情甚至也变得抽象起来，不过是种普通的情感而已。他们已经完全听任鼠疫的摆布，甚至有时候他们还渴望鼠疫能让他们陷入长眠，他们不断地想：“要是我患了鼠疫，就这样长睡不起多好啊！”但事实上，他们已经睡着了，这整个时期对他们而言不过是场梦而已。城里的居民都像是梦游者，只是偶尔在深夜里，当他们身上那些表面上已经愈合的伤口突然重新裂开时，他们才会清醒一下。惊醒过来之后，他们有些茫然又好奇地触摸一下伤口，撇一撇嘴，痛苦便又重新涌上心头，眼前突然浮现出心上人那悲伤的面容。一到清晨，他们又得回到正常状态——换句话说，他们又得面对鼠疫。","Obviously all this meant giving up what was most personal in their lives.Whereas in the early days of the plague they had been struck by the host of small details that, while meaning absolutely nothing to others, meant so much to them personally, and thus had realized, perhaps for the first time, the uniqueness of each man’s life; now, on the other hand, they took an interest only in what interested everyone else, they had only general ideas, and even their tenderest affections now seemed abstract, items of the common stock.So completely were they dominated by the plague that sometimes the one thing they aspired to was the long sleep it brought, and they caught themselves thinking: “A good thing if I get plague and have done with it!”But really they were asleep already; this whole period was for them no more than a long night’s slumber.The town was peopled with sleepwalkers, whose trance was broken only on the rare occasions when at night their wounds, to all appearance closed, suddenly reopened.Then, waking with a start, they would run their fingers over the wounds with a sort of absentminded curiosity, twisting their lips, and in a flash their grief blazed up again, and abruptly there rose before them the mournful visage of their love.In the morning they harked back to normal conditions—in other words, the plague."
"人们也许会问，这些鼠疫中的别离者到底给人留下什么印象呢？答案很简单，他们没给人留下什么印象。或者也可以说，他们看起来与其他人一样，没什么特别的。他们和城里的其他人一样，有些懒散，又有些孩子气的冲动。他们不再有丝毫的批判精神，而是摆出一副沉着冷静的样子。比如说，你会看到他们当中最聪明的人也会装模作样地和其他人一样看报纸听广播，希望能找到些依据来说明鼠疫很快就会结束。他们在读了某个记者坐在书桌旁疲惫得直打哈欠时随意撰写的报道后，要么看起来对未来报有幻想，要么就显示出过分的恐惧。与此同时，他们不是喝喝啤酒，便是照顾病人，不是无所事事，便是筋疲力尽，不是在办公室里整理归档文件，便是在家中听听唱片，表现得和其他人别无二致。换句话说，他们已经不再挑三拣四了，鼠疫已经消除了一切歧视。没有人会挑剔所购买的衣服和食物的质量问题，从这一点上可见一斑。每件东西都是来者不拒。","What impression, it may be asked, did these exiles of the plague make on the observer?The answer is simple; they made none.Or, to put it differently, they looked like everybody else, nondescript.They shared in the torpor of the town and in its puerile agitations.They lost every trace of a critical spirit, while gaining an air of sang-froid.You could see, for instance, even the most intelligent among them making a show like all the rest of studying the newspapers or listening to the radio, in the hope apparently of finding some reason to believe the plague would shortly end.They seemed to derive fantastic hopes or equally exaggerated fears from reading the linens that some journalist had scribbled at random, yawning with boredom at his desk.Meanwhile they drank their beer, nursed their sick, idled, or doped themselves with work, filed documents in offices, or played the phonograph at home, without betraying any difference from the rest of us.In other words, they had ceased to choose for themselves; plague had leveled out discrimination.This could be seen by the way nobody troubled about the quality of the clothes or food he bought.Everything was taken as it came."
"最后值得一提的是，那些与心上人两地相隔的人们已不再拥有鼠疫刚刚爆发时他们享有的那种奇怪的特权了。他们的爱情自我主义已经消失，由此得到的好处也因此而化为乌有。至少现在看来，情况非常明了，灾难已成为关乎每一个人的事情。那城门口不断回响着的枪声，那标志着生死节奏的盖印戳所发出的有规律的按压声，那些档案与火苗，惊慌失措与繁文缛节——伴随着这一切的是虽不体面却被登记在册的死亡。在浓浓的毒烟和救护车低沉的鸣笛声中，我们大家和流亡者一样，啃食着发馊的面包，下意识地等待着与亲人的重逢和内心重获安宁的奇迹的出现。毫无疑问，我们的爱情尚且存在，却发挥不了作用。我们心中的爱情已失去了活力，就像犯了罪、判了刑那样的无所作为。爱情已经变成一种毫无目标的忍耐，一种执拗的期盼。从这个角度来看，某些市民的态度与那些在食品店门外排着长队的人们的态度极为相似。同样的煎熬，同样的忍受，既看不到尽头，也看不到希望。无论怎样，如果要对城里这些与亲人分离的人们的心绪有个正确的了解，就必须再次想象一下那沉闷乏味的傍晚，当暮色降临到这座灰尘满地、缺树少阴的小城中时，大街上便挤满了成群的男男女女。这时候，最具特色的是，从沐浴在晚霞中的露台上能听到的声音不再是车辆发出的噪音——这通常是城市里唯一能听到的声音——而是混成一片的低沉的说话声和嘈杂的脚步声。人们聚在一起打发着时间，不绝于耳的脚步声和着鼠疫在闷热的天空中发出的奇怪的呼啸声。于是永不停歇、令人窒息的嗡嗡声逐渐充斥全城，一晚又一晚，悲切而又忠实地体现了一种盲目的坚忍，而它已经取代了我们所有人心中的爱情。","And, finally, it is worth noting that those who were parted ceased to enjoy the curious privilege that had been theirs at the outset.They had lost love’s egoism and the benefit they derived from it.Now, at least, the position was clear; this calamity was everybody’s business.What with the gunshots echoing at the gates, the punctual thuds of rubber stamps marking the rhythm of lives and deaths, the files and fires, the panics and formalities, all alike were pledged to an ugly but recorded death, and, amidst noxious fumes and the muted clang of ambulances, all of us ate the same sour bread of exile, unconsciously waiting for the same reunion, the same miracle of peace regained.No doubt our love persisted, but in practice it served nothing; it was an inert mass within us, sterile as crime or a life sentence.It had declined on a patience that led nowhere, a dogged expectation.Viewed from this angle, the attitude of some of our fellow citizens resembled that of the long queues one saw outside the food-shops.There was the same resignation, the same long-sufferance, inexhaustible and without illusions.In any case, if the reader would have a correct idea of the mood of these exiles, we must conjure up once more those dreary evenings sifting down through a haze of dust and golden light upon the treeless streets filled with teeming crowds of men and women.For, characteristically, the sound that rose toward the terraces still bathed in the last glow of daylight, now that the noises of vehicles and motors—the sole voice of cities in ordinary times—had ceased, was but one vast rumor of low voices and incessant footfalls, the drumming of innumerable soles timed to the eerie whistling of the plague in the sultry air above, the sound of a huge concourse of people marking time, a never ending, stifling drone that, gradually swelling, filled the town from end to end, and evening after evening gave its truest, mournfulest expression to the blind endurance that had ousted love from all our hearts."
"第四部","PART IV "
"第十八章","Chapter 18"
"从九月到十月，鼠疫在奥兰疯狂肆虐，整座城市都死气沉沉的。除了“掰着指头过日子”没有别的事可干，成千上万的男男女女就靠这个捱过一周又一周，似乎永无出头之日。薄雾、热潮和阵雨轮番袭击着大街小巷。一群来自南方的欧椋鸟和画眉鸟悄无声息地掠过苍穹，绕城而过，就像帕纳卢神父描述的——瘟神在屋顶上空挥舞着那根古怪的长矛，呼呼作响，吓得它们不敢靠近。十月初，倾盆大雨把街道冲洗得干干净净。而我们始终没有什么重要事情可做，只是无尽的等待而已。","Throughout september and October the town lay prostrate, at the mercy of the plague.There was nothing to do but to “mark time,” and some hundreds of thousands of men and women went on doing this, through weeks that seemed interminable.Mist, heat, and rain rang their changes in our streets.From the south came silent coveys of starlings and thrushes, flying very high, but always giving the town a wide berth, as though the strange implement of the plague described by Paneloux, the giant flail whirling and shrilling over the housetops, warned them off us.At the beginning of October torrents of rain swept the streets clean.And all the time nothing more important befell us than that multitudinous marking time."
"就是在这段时间，里厄和他的朋友们开始感到疲惫不堪。事实上，卫生队的队员们已经再也无法忍受这种劳累了。里厄发现，不仅仅在同事们身上，而且在自己身上都发生着这种变化，大家似乎对周围的一切都出奇地漠不关心。例如，有些人以前十分关注有关鼠疫的所有消息，现在却对此毫无兴趣。朗贝尔临时负责管理一个鼠疫隔离站——此站设在他所住的旅馆里——他对在他那里隔离观察的人数了如指掌，对自己制定的办事程序烂熟于心：一旦出现鼠疫病征，病人需立即转院治疗。他也非常清楚他那个隔离站里用在隔离病人身上的抗鼠疫疫药效的相关数据。但是，他说不出每周有多少人死于鼠疫，甚至不清楚死亡人数到底是上升了还是下降了。而且，无论如何，他仍然期盼有一天自己可以“成功逃跑”。","It was now that Rieux and his friends came to realize how exhausted they were.Indeed, the workers in the sanitary squads had given up trying to cope with their fatigue.Rieux noticed the change coming over his associates, and himself as well, and it took the form of a strange indifference to everything.Men, for instance, who hitherto had shown a keen interest in every scrap of news concerning the plague now displayed none at all.Rambert, who had been temporarily put in charge of a quarantine station—his hotel had been taken over for this purpose—could state at any moment the exact number of persons under his observation, and every detail of the procedure he had laid down for the prompt evacuation of those who suddenly developed symptoms of the disease was firmly fixed in his mind.The same was true of the statistics of the effects of anti-plague inoculations on the persons in his quarantine station.Nevertheless, he could not have told you the week’s total of plague deaths, and he could not even have said if the figure was rising or falling.And meanwhile, in spite of everything, he had not lost hope of being able to “make his get-away” from one day to another."
"至于其他人员，由于他们夜以继日地工作，几乎是连轴转，他们既不看报，也不听广播。如果有人告诉他们某种意想不到的疗效，他们会装作很感兴趣的样子，但实际上却是置若罔闻，人们不禁会想起大战时的那些士兵，他们成天只想着完成任务，累得筋疲力尽，甚至对决战或是停战的军号声都不再指望了。","As for the others, working themselves almost to a standstill throughout the day and far into the night, they never bothered to read a newspaper or listen to the radio.When told of some unlooked-for recovery, they made a show of interest, but actually received the news with the stolid indifference that we may imagine the fighting man in a great war to feel who, worn out by the incessant strain and mindful only of the duties daily assigned to him, has ceased even to hope for the decisive battle or the bugle-call of armistice."
"尽管格朗还在继续对鼠疫相关数据进行机械的统计，但他肯定说不出这样做到底有什么意义。他不像里厄、朗贝尔和塔鲁他们那样看上去就精力充沛，他的身体向来不好。而现在，他除了要承担市政府的工作，还要在里厄这里做秘书工作，晚上还要继续自己的写作。人们可以看到，倦意就写在他的脸上，不过他还在继续扛着，因为有那么两三个信念在支撑着他，而其中的一个信念就是，鼠疫一结束，他会彻底休个假，至少一星期，并利用这段时间投入到他那项使人“脱帽致敬”的工作中去。他有时也会多愁善感，每到这时，他就会向里厄倾诉自己对珍妮的思念。他想知道她现在身在何方，她看到报上的消息时是否偶尔会想到他？有一天，里厄用十分平淡的语气同格朗谈起自己的妻子——这令里厄自己都感到惊讶，因为以前他从未与任何人这样谈过。","Though he still worked out methodically the figures relating to the plague, Grand would certainly have been quite unable to say to what they pointed.Unlike Rieux, Rambert, and Tarrou, who obviously had great powers of endurance, he had never had good health.And now, in addition to his duties in the Municipal Office, he had his night work and his secretarial post under Rieux.One could see that the strain was telling on him, and if he managed to keep going, it was thanks to two or three fixed ideas, one of which was to take, the moment the plague ended, a complete vacation, of a week at least, which he would devote, “hats off,” to his work in progress.He was also becoming subject to accesses of sentimentality and at such times would unburden himself to Rieux about Jeanne.Where was she now, he wondered; did her thoughts sometimes turn to him when she read the papers?It was Grand to whom one day Rieux caught himself talking—much to his own surprise—about his wife, and in the most commonplace terms—something he had never done as yet to anyone."
"他不大相信妻子发来的电报——电报中都是些要他安心的话——于是他决定给那家疗养院的主任医师发个电报问问情况。他从回电中得知妻子病情加重，但院方正在尽全力控制她的病情进一步恶化。他一直都把这个消息埋在心底，一定是心理压力太大，他才向格朗谈起这事来。格朗原本先是对医生谈起珍妮，之后又问起里厄太太的情况，在听了里厄的回答后，他说：“你知道，现在这种病的疗效是非常显著的。”里厄对此表示赞同，只是又说他开始感觉到与妻子分开得太久了，而且，他本可以帮助妻子早日康复的。但是，以目前的情况来看，她一定感到非常孤独。说完之后，他突然沉默下来，只是含糊其辞地回答了格朗提出的几个问题。","Doubtful how far he could trust his wife’s telegrams—their tone was always reassuring—he had decided to wire the house physician of the sanatorium.The reply informed him that her condition had worsened, but everything was being done to arrest further progress of the disease.He had kept the news to himself so far and could only put it down to his nervous exhaustion that he passed it on to Grand.After talking to the doctor about Jeanne, Grand had asked some questions about Mme Rieux and, on hearing Rieux’s reply, said: “You know, it’s wonderful, the cures they bring off nowadays.”Rieux agreed, merely adding that the long separation was beginning to tell on him, and, what was more, he might have helped his wife to make a good recovery; whereas, as things were, she must be feeling terribly lonely.After which he fell silent and gave only evasive answers to Grand’s further questions."
"其他人的状况也大致相同。塔鲁算是更扛得住一些，但他日记中的记录显示出他虽然仍旧喜欢对事物打探个究竟，却不像以往那样兴趣广泛了。事实上，在这段时期，唯一令他感兴趣的显然只有科塔尔一个人。晚上，在里厄家里——因为旅馆被改成了隔离站，他已经住进了医生家——当格朗和医生谈论当天的疫情数据时，他对此并不太关心。他会很快将谈话转到他感兴趣的话题上去，即奥兰的日常生活琐事。","The others were in much the same state.Tarrou held his own better, but the entries in his diary show that while his curiosity had kept its depth, it had lost its diversity.Indeed, throughout this period the only person, apparently, who really interested him was Cottard.In the evening, at Rieux’s apartment, where he had come to live now that the hotel was requisitioned as a quarantine center, he paid little or no attention to Grand and the doctor when they read over the day’s statistics.At the earliest opportunity he switched the conversation over to his pet subject, small details of the daily life at Oran."
"卡斯特尔则显得比其他任何人都更疲惫。有一天，他过来告诉里厄说，抗鼠疫血清已经准备就绪，于是两人决定在奥顿先生的小儿子，一个看起来毫无希望的病人身上进行首次实验。当医生正在宣布最新统计数字时，他突然发现卡斯特尔已经倒在椅子上睡熟了。这位老朋友脸上的异样令里厄感到震惊。以前，卡斯特尔的脸上总是露出一种慈祥而又带些讥讽的微笑，显示出无限的青春活力。现在，他的脸上完全变了样，微微张开的嘴边流着一滴口水，透露出他年事已高，精力不济。看到这一切，里厄感到如鲠在喉。","More perhaps than any of them, Dr. Castel showed signs of wear and tear.On the day when he came to tell Rieux that the anti-plague serum was ready, and they decided to try it for the first time on M. Othon’s small son, whose case seemed all but hopeless, Rieux suddenly noticed, while he was announcing the latest statistics, that Castel was slumped in his chair, sound asleep.The difference in his old friend’s face shocked him.The smile of benevolent irony that always played on it had seemed to endow it with perpetual youth; now, abruptly left out of control, with a trickle of saliva between the slightly parted lips, it betrayed its age and the wastage of the years.And, seeing this, Rieux felt a lump come to his throat."
"正是在这样的时候，里厄就会感到自己的疲惫。他的感情也变得有些失控。他一直都压抑着自己的情感，但现在却变得很难受、很脆弱，偶尔感觉自己的情绪像是要一发不可收拾了似的，要完全被自己的感情俘虏了。他唯一能做的便是勒住情感的缰绳，硬下心肠保护自己。他知道这是他继续坚持下去的唯一办法。毕竟，他已经没有什么幻想了，即使还有点儿残余也被疲劳磨灭了。他很清楚，在这个看不到尽头的时期里，他的职责不再是给人治病，而是诊断。发现、观察、描述、登记，然后宣告病人患有不治之症——这就是他目前所发挥的作用。有时候，病人的女眷会拽着他的袖子大哭着说：“医生，你会救他的，对吧？”但是他那时的职责并非挽救生命，他要做的只是下令将病人进行隔离。他在那些人脸上看到的是怎样的一种憎恨呀！“你没有心肝！”有个女眷曾经这样说过他。她错了，他有。正是这颗心二十小时看着他，让他时刻观察着那些本想继续活下去的人们不断死去。正是这颗心使他在每个早晨都能精神焕发。但在目前的状况下，他的心只能让他做到这一步。而这颗心又怎能足以救人性命呢？","It was by such lapses that Rieux could gauge his exhaustion.His sensibility was getting out of hand.Kept under all the time, it had grown hard and brittle and seemed to snap completely now and then, leaving him the prey of his emotions.No resource was left him but to tighten the stranglehold on his feelings and harden his heart protectively.For he knew this was the only way of carrying on.In any case, he had few illusions left, and fatigue was robbing him of even these remaining few.He knew that, over a period whose end he could not glimpse, his task was no longer to cure but to diagnose.To detect, to see, to describe, to register, and then condemn—that was his present function.Sometimes a woman would clutch his sleeve, crying shrilly: “Doctor, you’ll save him, won’t you?”But he wasn’t there for saving life; he was there to order a sick man’s evacuation.How futile was the hatred he saw on faces then!“You haven’t a heart!” a woman told him on one occasion.She was wrong; he had one.It saw him through his twenty-hour day, when he hourly watched men dying who were meant to live.It enabled him to start anew each morning.He had just enough heart for that, as things were now.How could that heart have sufficed for saving life?"
"不，在那些繁忙的日子里，他提供给他人的不是救护——只是信息而已。这显然称不上是一个男人真正的职业。然而，说到底，在那人心惶惶、惨遭鼠疫屠戮的人群中，谁还会有机会来做些真正有男子气概的事情呢？事实上，疲劳却使里厄因祸得福。要是他没有这么累，他就会更敏感，也可能会因为那种四处弥漫的死亡气息而极度伤感。但是，一个每天只睡四个小时的人是不会多愁善感的。他很客观地看待事物，可以说，他对待事物的态度过于公正——这种公正令人生厌，毫无变通。而其他人，也就是那些病入膏肓的人们，也都有着和他一样令人沮丧的觉悟。在鼠疫发生前，他被当作是救星而受到欢迎。他给病人开几片药，或是打一针就可以治好病，而病人也会挽着他的胳膊走向病房。这样做尽管有感染的危险，却令人愉悦。现在，截然相反，他去病人家时要带上士兵，必须用枪托砸门，病人的家人才会开门。如果可以的话，他们倒想拖着他，拖着整个人类和他们一起走向死亡。是的，人确实离不开自己的同胞；每当他离开这些不幸的人们时，他都会心生怜悯，而他其实也和这些人一样无助，也同样应该得到他人的怜悯。","No, it wasn’t medical aid that he dispensed in those crowded days—only information.Obviously that could hardly be reckoned a man’s job.Yet, when all was said and done, who, in that terror-stricken, decimated populace, had scope for any activity worthy of his manhood?Indeed, for Rieux his exhaustion was a blessing in disguise.Had he been less tired, his senses more alert, that all-pervading odor of death might have made him sentimental.But when a man has had only four hours’ sleep, he isn’t sentimental.He sees things as they are; that is to say, he sees them in the garish light of justice—hideous, witless justice.And those others, the men and women under sentence to death, shared his bleak enlightenment.Before the plague he was welcomed as a savior.He was going to make them right with a couple of pills or an injection, and people took him by the arm on his way to the sickroom.Flattering, but dangerous.Now, on the contrary, he came accompanied by soldiers, and they had to hammer on the door with rifle-butts before the family would open it.They would have liked to drag him, drag the whole human race, with them to the grave.Yes, it was quite true that men can’t do without their fellow men; that he was as helpless as these unhappy people and he, too, deserved the same faint thrill of pity that he allowed himself once he had left them."
"不管怎样，在那段似乎看不到尽头的日子里，这就是医生心里的想法，而且这些想法里还夹杂着对他妻子的思念。这也是他那些朋友们的想法，从他们脸上的表情就看得出来。但是，参加抗疫战争的人们感到越来越扛不住了，但由此产生的最危险的后果并非他们对外界事物及他人情感漠不关心，而是他们的个人生活变得松懈懒散起来。他们中间开始有这么一种趋势：任何看起来不是绝对必要的事情，或是他们力所不及的事情，他们都懒得去做。这样一来，这些人就越来越不遵守以前自己制定的卫生规则，经常省去一些本该进行的消毒程序，有时甚至不采取预防传染的措施就赶到患肺鼠疫的病人家里，因为他们都是临时被叫去病人家，有时又离卫生站很远，他们不愿费神返回去注射必要的防疫药物。这是真正的危险；他们全力以赴进行的抗疫斗争使自己更易受到疫病的感染。总之，他们是在碰运气，而并非人人都能走运。","Such, anyhow, were the thoughts that in those endless-seeming weeks ran in the doctor’s mind, along with thoughts about his severance from his wife.And such, too, were his friends’ thoughts, judging by the look he saw on their faces.But the most dangerous effect of the exhaustion steadily gaining on all engaged in the fight against the epidemic did not consist in their relative indifference to outside events and the feelings of others, but in the slackness and supine-ness that they allowed to invade their personal lives.They developed a tendency to shirk every movement that didn’t seem absolutely necessary or called for efforts that seemed too great to be worth while.Thus these men were led to break, oftener and oftener, the rules of hygiene they themselves had instituted, to omit some of the numerous disinfections they should have practiced, and sometimes to visit the homes of people suffering from pneumonic plague without taking steps to safeguard themselves against infection, because they had been notified only at the last moment and could not be bothered with returning to a sanitary service station, sometimes a considerable distance away, to have the necessary instillations.There lay the real danger; for the energy they devoted to righting the disease made them all the more liable to it.In short, they were gambling on their luck, and luck is not to be coerced."
"但是，城里却有一人看上去既不疲惫，也不沮丧。事实上，他露出了一副满意的神情。这人就是科塔尔。尽管他与里厄和朗贝尔保持着联系，但关系还是有些疏远，然而，他却乐于发展与塔鲁的关系，只要塔鲁有空，就会去看他。他这样做有两方面的原因：一方面，塔鲁了解他的一切；另一方面，塔鲁总是真诚地接待他，让他感觉很自在。这是塔鲁了不起的地方之一，不管工作有多累，他总是乐于倾听，和蔼可亲。甚至有几个晚上他似乎已经筋疲力尽了，但第二天他又精神焕发。“我跟塔鲁很谈得来，”科塔尔曾经对朗贝尔说，“因为他很通人情。他总是很体谅人。”","There was, however, one man in the town who seemed neither exhausted nor discouraged; indeed, the living image of contentment.It was Cottard.Though maintaining contact with Rieux and Rambert, he still kept rather aloof, whereas he deliberately cultivated Tarrou, seeing him as often as Tarrou’s scanty leisure permitted.He had two reasons for this: one, that Tarrou knew all about his case, and the other, that he always gave him a cordial welcome and made him feel at ease.That was one of the remarkable things about Tarrou; no matter how much work he had put in, he was always a ready listener and an agreeable companion.Even when, some evenings, he seemed completely worn out, the next day brought him a new lease of energy.“Tarrou’s a fellow one can talk to,” Cottard once told Rambert, “because he’s really human.He always understands.”"
"也许就是出于这个原因，塔鲁在这个时期的日记内容逐渐集中到了科塔尔身上。很显然，塔鲁试图在日记中如实地或者按照自己的理解全面地描绘科塔尔这个人，并且记录下科塔尔所有的想法和做法。这篇题为“科塔尔及其与鼠疫的关系”的系列记录写了好几页纸，笔者认为有必要在这里简要介绍一下它的内容。","This may explain why the entries in Tarrou’s diary of this period tend to converge on Cottard’s personality.It is obvious that Tarrou was attempting to give a full-length picture of the man and noted all his reactions and reflections, whether as conveyed to him by Cottard or interpreted by himself.Under the heading “Cottard and his Relations with the Plague,” we find a series, of notes covering several pages and, in the narrator’s opinion, these are well worth summarizing here."
"日记中有段话概括了塔鲁对科塔尔的印象：“他是个正在成长起来的人物。他友好亲切，富有幽默感。”科塔尔对事态的发展根本就不感到心烦。有时，他会在塔鲁面前用这类话来表达他真实的想法：“情况还在恶化，对吧？不过，毕竟大家是同舟共济的。”","One of the entries gives Tarrou’s general impression of Cottard at this time: “He is blossoming out.Expanding in geniality and good humor.”For Cottard was anything but upset by the turn events were taking.Sometimes in Tarrou’s company he voiced his true feelings in remarks of this order: “Getting worse every day, isn’t it?Well, anyhow, everyone’s in the same boat.”"
"“显然，”塔鲁评论道：“他和其他人一样都面临着死亡的威胁，但这正是关键所在，他与其他人生死与共。其次，我非常确信他并不真的认为自己会面临感染的危险。他显然头脑中有这种思想——这也许从表面上看不出来——一个正在遭受某种重大疾病或被死亡焦虑所折磨的人是不会再受到其他疾病或忧虑困扰的。‘你是否已经注意到，’他曾经问我，‘一个人是不会同时患上两种病的？假设你患有像癌症或是百日痨这样的不治之症——那么，你就不会患上鼠疫或是斑疹伤寒；生理上是绝对不可能的。事实上，情况还不仅仅是这样；难道你听说过一个癌症病人死于车祸这样的事吗？’这种说法，不管它是否正确，却使科塔尔心情愉悦。他最担心的事就是自己被隔离，他宁愿和大家一起被围困，也不愿做个孤独的囚徒。鼠疫一来，警察盘问、侦察、逮捕令等都自然化为乌有了。可以说，现在根本就没有警察的概念。过去的或是现在的罪行都不存在了，罪犯也不存在了——只有被鼠疫‘判了刑’的人在期盼着它任性的恩赐，这些人当中就有警察。”","“Obviously,” Tarrou comments, “he’s in the same peril of death as everyone else, but that’s just the point; he’s in it with the others.And then I’m pretty sure he doesn’t seriously think he runs much personal risk.He has got the idea into his head, apparently—and perhaps it’s not so farfetched as it seems—that a man suffering from a dangerous ailment or grave anxiety is allergic to other ailments and anxieties.‘Have you noticed,’ he asked me, ‘that no one ever runs two diseases at once?Let’s suppose you have an incurable disease like cancer or a galloping consumption—well, you’ll never get plague or typhus; it’s a physical impossibility.In fact, one might go farther; have you ever heard of a man with cancer being killed in an auto smash?’ This theory, for what it’s worth, keeps Cottard cheerful.The thing he’d most detest is being cut off from others; he’d rather be one of a beleaguered crowd than a prisoner alone.The plague has put an effective stop to police inquiries, sleuthings, warrants of arrest, and so forth.Come to that, we have no police nowadays; no crimes past or present, no more criminals—only condemned men hoping for the most capricious of pardons; and among these are the police themselves.”"
"因此，科塔尔（如果塔鲁的判断可信的话）有充分的理由以一种体贴、宽容而满意的态度去看待周围的市民们所表现出来的惊慌与痛苦，这从科塔尔的话中可见一斑：“尽管说吧，朋友们，但这一切我早就经历过了！”","Thus Cottard (if we may trust Tarrou’s diagnosis) had good grounds for viewing the symptoms of mental confusion and distress in those around him with an understanding and an indulgent satisfaction that might have found expression in the remark: “Prate away, my friends—but I had it first!”"
"“我对他说过，”塔鲁继续写道，“要使自己不脱离群众，就一定要做到问心无愧，而他却对此大皱眉头。‘如果是这样的话，每个人都得孤立无援了。’过了一会儿，他又补充说：‘你爱怎么说就怎么说，塔鲁，但我得对你说：使人们凝聚在一起的唯一途径就是让他们都患上鼠疫。你还是看看你周围的情况吧。’我当然懂得他的意思，我也清楚目前的生活对他来说一定是非常舒适的。人们对情况变化所作的反应跟他以前一样，他怎么会视而不见呢？人人都试图与众人为伍；人们有时乐于帮助迷路者，有时又大发脾气；人们涌入高级饭店，乐滋滋地呆在那里不愿离去；每天，人们在电影院门口排着长队，把剧院和歌舞厅挤得满满的，像汹涌的潮水一样涌入广场和大街；人们害怕与人接触，但是对人类热情的渴望又促使男男女女相互依偎，耳鬓厮磨。科塔尔显然早已经历过这一切——但有一个例外，那就是他没有找过女人。看看他那副模样吧！我猜想当他想上妓院时，他就努力克制自己，那可能会坏了他的名声，有朝一日会对他自己不利。”","“When I suggested to him,” Tarrou continues, “that the surest way of not being cut off from others was having a clean conscience, he frowned.‘If that is so, everyone’s always cut off from everyone else.’ And a moment later he added: ‘Say what you like, Tarrou, but let me tell you this: the one way of making people hang together is to give ’em a spell of plague.You’ve only got to look around you.’ Of course I see his point, and I understand how congenial our present mode of life must be to him.How could he fail to recognize at every turn reactions that were his; the efforts everyone makes to keep on the right side of other people; the obligingness sometimes shown in helping someone who has lost his way, and the ill humor shown at other times; the way people flock to the luxury restaurants, their pleasure at being there and their reluctance to leave; the crowds lining up daily at the picture-houses, filling theaters and music halls and even dance halls, and flooding boisterously out into the squares and avenues; the shrinking from every contact and, notwithstanding, the craving for human warmth that urges people to one another, body to body, sex to sex?Cottard has been through all that obviously—with one exception; we may rule out women in his case.With that mug of his!And I should say that when tempted to visit a brothel he refrains; it might give him a bad name and be held up against him one day."
"“总之，鼠疫使他感到荣幸。鼠疫让一个讨厌孤独却孤独的人成了它的同谋。是的，‘同谋’这个词用在他身上恰如其分，看看他有多享受其中吧！他很高兴看到周围的一切：那些整日神经紧张、惶惶不安的人迷信、敏感、盲目恐惧；他们想要尽力回避鼠疫这个话题，却又不停地谈及鼠疫；他们知道鼠疫的早期症状为头痛，因而稍有头痛就惊慌失措；还有，他们极度紧张与敏感，稍有怠慢就会生气，丢了一粒裤子纽扣也会伤心落泪。”塔鲁常常在晚上和科塔尔一块儿出去，于是他的笔记里有了这样的记叙：他俩如何在黄昏时分一起挤入大街上黑压压的人群之中；他俩如何在昏暗的路灯下摩肩接踵地夹杂在若隐若现的人堆里；他俩如何跟随着人群去寻欢作乐的胜地，有人陪伴的温暖似乎可以摆脱鼠疫的冰冷气息。这就是科塔尔几个月前在公共场所苦苦追寻的豪华奢侈的生活，也是他一直梦寐以求却无法实现的花天酒地的生活——现在全城市民都趋之若骛。尽管价格在疯涨，人们从未像今天这样挥金如土，尽管日用品都供应短缺，人们从未像现在这样将大把的金钱花在奢侈品上。尽管现在失业现象严重，各种娱乐场所却成百倍地增加。有时，塔鲁和科塔尔会跟在某对恋人身后走上一段。以前，恋人们会尽量避人耳目，掩盖彼此的热情；而现在，他们却在人群中紧紧依偎，在大街上逛来逛去，爱得忘乎所以，旁若无人。科塔尔喜滋滋地看着这一切。“太棒了，亲爱的！”他叫道，“加油！”甚至他的声音都变了，大声嚷嚷着。正如塔鲁所写的那样，在这种群体性狂热的气氛中，在这种大把大把扔小费的闹声中，看着眼皮底下恋人们的公开调情，科塔尔正在“成长”起来。","“In short, this epidemic has done him proud.Of a lonely man who hated loneliness it has made an accomplice.Yes, ‘accomplice’ is the word that fits, and doesn’t he relish his complicity!He is happily at one with all around him, with their superstitions, their groundless panics, the susceptibilities of people whose nerves are always on the stretch; with their fixed idea of talking the least possible about plague and nevertheless talking of it all the time; with their abject terror at the slightest headache, now they know headache to be an early symptom of the disease; and, lastly, with their frayed, irritable sensibility that takes offense at trifling oversights and brings tears to their eyes over the loss of a trouser-button.”Tarrou often went out with Cottard in the evening, and he describes how they would plunge together into the dark crowds filling the streets at nightfall; how they mingled, shoulder to shoulder, in the black-andwhite moving mass lit here and there by the fitful gleam of a street-lamp; and how they let themselves be swept along with the human herd toward resorts of pleasure whose companionable warmth seemed a safeguard from the plague’s cold breath.What Cottard had some months previously been looking for in public places, luxury and the lavish life, the frenzied orgies he had dreamed of without being able to procure them—these were now the quest of a whole populace.Though prices soared inevitably, never had so much money been squandered, and while bare necessities were often lacking, never had so much been spent on superfluities.All the recreations of leisure, due though it now was to unemployment, multiplied a hundredfold.Sometimes Tarrou and Cottard would follow for some minutes one of those amorous couples who in the past would have tried to hide the passion drawing them to each other, but now, pressed closely to each other’s side, paraded the streets among the crowd, with the trancelike self-absorption of great lovers, oblivious of the people around them.Cottard watched them gloatingly.“Good work, my dears!” he’d exclaim.“Go to it!”Even his voice had changed, grown louder; as Tarrou wrote, he was “blossoming out” in the congenial atmosphere of mass excitement, fantastically large tips clinking on cafe tables, love-affairs shaping under his eyes."
"但是，在塔鲁看来，科塔尔的这种态度并没有多少恶意。他所说的“这一切我都经历过”与其说是在显示他的得意，不如说是表明了他的不幸遭遇。“我认为，”塔鲁写道，“他开始由衷地喜欢上了这些身陷囹圄、被困城中的人们。比如，他一有机会就会向人们解释鼠疫并非那么可怕。‘你听听他们在说些什么，’他对我说，‘鼠疫过后，我要做这事，我要做那事。’他们都是在自寻烦恼，而非随遇而安。他们甚至看不到自己从中获得的好处。就说我自己吧，难道我能说“在我被捕后，我要做这做那”吗？被捕只是个开始，而不是结束。但是鼠疫……你想知道我的意思吧？他们太急躁，只因他们不能顺其自然。我这样说并非信口开河。’”","However, Tarrou seemed to detect little if any spitefulness in Cottard’s attitude.His “I’ve been through the mill myself” had more pity than triumph in it.“I suspect,” Tarrou wrote, “that he’s getting quite fond of these people shut up under their little patch of sky within their city walls.For instance, he’d like to explain to them, if he had a chance, that it isn’t so terrible as all that.‘You hear them saying,’ he told me, ‘After the plague I’ll do this or that.’They’re eating their hearts out instead of staying put.And they don’t even realize their privileges.Take my case: could I say “After my arrest I’ll do this or that”?Arrest’s a beginning, not an end.Whereas plague....Do you know what I think?They’re fretting simply because they won’t let themselves go.And I know what I’m talking about.’” "
"“是的，他并非信口开河，”塔鲁继续写道，“他很理解这里的居民生活中的异常状况，尽管他们本能地渴望与人交往，但又由于不信任而彼此疏远，没有办法让自己屈从于这种渴望。因为他们都知道不能轻信自己的邻居，邻居可能会在他们毫无觉察之中，乘他们毫无戒心之机，把鼠疫传染给他们。假如有人像科塔尔那样花上些时间就在人群中，甚至在朋友当中发现了某个告密者人，那么他也可以理解这种心理。他也会同情这些整日经受思想折磨的人们，他们认为鼠疫可能会在他们最没意料到的时候将它那冰冷的手落在他们的肩头，可能正当他们庆幸自己未被传染之时，鼠疫就突然来临了。尽管有这种可能，科塔尔在恐怖的气氛中却感到自由自在。不过，我猜想正是因为他已经历过这一切，他才不会像其他人那样沉浸在忐忑不安的痛苦之中。可以这样说：像我们所有这些还没有丧命于鼠疫的人一样，他也十分清楚，他的自由和他的生命随时都可能毁于一旦。但因为他已亲身体验过生活在恐惧之中的滋味，他认为其他人尝尝这种滋味也很正常。或许也可以这样说：在他看来，像现在这样大家分担恐惧比他以前一人独自忍受恐惧要好受多了。他错就错在这一点上，这也使他比别人更难被人理解。不过，虽然如此，他却因此比别人更值得我们去了解。”","“Yes, he knows what he’s talking about,” Tarrou added.“He has an insight into the anomalies in the lives of the people here who, though they have an instinctive craving for human contacts, can’t bring themselves to yield to it, because of the mistrust that keeps them apart.For it’s common knowledge that you can’t trust your neighbor; he may pass the disease to you without your knowing it, and take advantage of a moment of inadvertence on your part to infect you.When one has spent one’s days, as Cottard has, seeing a possible police spy in everyone, even in persons he feels drawn to, it’s easy to understand this reaction.One can have fellow-feelings toward people who are haunted by the idea that when they least expect it plague may lay its cold hand on their shoulders, and is, perhaps, about to do so at the very moment when one is congratulating oneself on being safe and sound.So far as this is possible, he is at ease under a reign of terror.But I suspect that, just because he has been through it before them, he can’t wholly share with them the agony of this feeling of uncertainty that never leaves them.It comes to this: like all of us who have not yet died of plague he fully realizes that his freedom and his life may be snatched from him at any moment.But since he, personally, has learned what it is to live in a state of constant fear, he finds it normal that others should come to know this state.Or perhaps it should be put like this: fear seems to him more bearable under these conditions than it was when he had to bear its burden alone.In this respect he’s wrong, and this makes him harder to understand than other people.Still, after all, that’s why he is worth a greater effort to understand.”"
"塔鲁在笔记的末尾还讲述了一个故事，它反映了生活在这座疫城里的科塔尔和其他居民身上都存在的一种奇怪心理。这个故事几乎可以再现这个时期极度狂热的气氛，因此笔者认为它很重要。","Tarrou’s notes end with a story illustrating the curious state of mind arrived at no less by Cottard than by other dwellers in the plague-stricken town.The story recreates as nearly as may be the curiously feverish atmosphere of this period, and that is why the narrator attaches importance to it."
"有一天晚上，科塔尔和塔鲁一起去市歌剧院观看格卢克的歌剧《俄耳甫斯》的演出。塔鲁是应科塔尔的邀请前去剧院的。这个巡回演出剧团是在春天时来到奥兰进行系列演出的。鼠疫爆发后，这个剧团被困在这里艰难度日，于是与歌剧院签定了一个演出协议：除非另有通知，剧团每周表演一次。因此，几个月来，每到周五，歌剧院里便会响起俄耳甫斯旋律优美的哀歌和欧律狄刻微弱无力的恳求。然而，这部歌剧依然很受欢迎，歌剧院也总是场场爆满。坐在票价最高的座位上，科塔尔和塔鲁一低头就可以看到正厅前座部分坐满了奥兰上流社会的人士。看着他们优雅地进场入座时小心的模样真是件有趣的事情。在耀眼的舞台灯光下，当乐师们小心翼翼地出场时，可以清晰地看见身着晚礼服的人们从一排座位走到另一排座位，温文尔雅地向朋友们鞠躬致意。在举止优雅的轻声交谈中，他们又恢复了自信，而他们行走在城里阴暗的街道上时是没有自信的；晚礼服的魅力确实让人忘却了鼠疫。","One evening Cottard and Tarrou went to the Municipal Opera House, where Gluck’s Orpheus was being given.Cottard had invited Tarrou.A touring operatic company had come to Oran in the spring for a series of performances.Marooned there by the outbreak of plague and finding themselves in difficulties, the company and the management of the opera house had come to an agreement under which they were to give one performance a week until further notice.Thus for several months our theater had been resounding every Friday evening with the melodious laments of Orpheus and Eurydice’s vain appeals.None the less, the opera continued in high favor and played regularly to full houses.From their seats, the most expensive, Cottard and Tarrou could look down at the orchestra seats filled to capacity with the cream of Oran society.It was interesting to see how careful they were, as they went to their places, to make an elegant entrance.While the musicians were discreetly tuning up, men in evening dress could be seen moving from one row to another, bowing gracefully to friends under the flood of light bathing the proscenium.In the soft hum of well-mannered conversation they regained the confidence denied them when they walked the dark streets of the town; evening dress was a sure charm against plague."
"在整个第一幕中，俄耳甫斯因为痛失爱妻欧律狄刻而动情哀歌，而几个身穿希腊束身外衣的女演员则唱着优美的和声评论着俄耳甫斯的悲惨命运，他们不断交替传唱的正是爱的圣歌。观众席中响起了一些掌声，以示欣赏。只有少数人注意到俄耳甫斯在第二幕的演唱中带有一些不应有的颤音，而当他向冥王动情哭诉以乞求怜悯时，他的声调也有些夸张。他有些动作不稳，但行家们也以为这种失误是表演者巧妙的艺术处理，虽说有些过头，但却展现了他唱词中的感情。","Throughout the first act Orpheus lamented suavely his lost Eurydice, with women in Grecian tunics singing melodious comments on his plight, and love was hymned in alternating strophes.The audience showed their appreciation in discreet applause.Only a few people noticed that in his song of the second act Orpheus introduced some tremolos not in the score and voiced an almost exaggerated emotion when begging the lord of the Underworld to be moved by his tears.Some rather jerky movements he indulged in gave our connoisseurs of stagecraft an impression of clever, if slightly overdone, effects, intended to bring out the emotion of the words he sang."
"直到第三幕中俄耳甫斯和欧律狄刻唱二重唱时——欧律狄刻和她的爱人诀别之时——歌剧院里这才一片惊讶。这位男演员似乎等的就是观众的这种反应，或者更有可能的是，因为正厅前座传来的嘈杂声认可了他所表达的情感，于是他选择在这个时刻穿着古装，张开双臂，分开双腿，异样地蹒跚着朝台前的脚灯走去，并在道具羊圈的中央倒了下去。这些羊圈总是格格不入，但此刻，在观众们看来，它们显得尤为蹩脚。也就在这个时刻，乐队停止了演奏，起初，观众们起身，开始缓慢而安静地退场，就像刚做完礼拜离开教堂，或者像参加完遗体告别仪式走出殡仪馆。女人们提着裙子、低着头，男人们则挽着女伴，带着她们避开后排的那些翻椅。但是，渐渐地，人们加快了步伐，窃窃私语变成了大声叫喊。最后，人们蜂拥向出口，在关卡处挤作一堆，接着又惊恐地尖叫着涌入大街，乱作一团。","Not until the big duet between Orpheus and Eurydice in the third act—at the precise moment when Eurydice was slipping from her lover—did a flutter of surprise run through the house.And as though the singer had been waiting for this cue or, more likely, because the faint sounds that came to him from the orchestra seats confirmed what he was feeling, he chose this moment to stagger grotesquely to the footlights, his arms and legs splayed out under his antique robe, and fall down in the middle of the property sheepfold, always out of place, but now, in the eyes of the spectators, significantly, appallingly so.For at the same moment the orchestra stopped playing, the audience rose and began to leave the auditorium, slowly and silently at first, like worshippers leaving church when the service ends, or a deathchamber after a farewell visit to the dead, women lifting their skirts and moving with bowed heads, men steering the ladies by the elbow to prevent their brushing against the tip-up seats at the ends of the rows.But gradually their movements quickened, whispers rose to exclamations, and finally the crowd stampeded toward the exits, wedged together in the bottlenecks, and pouring out into the street in a confused mass, with shrill cries of dismay."
"科塔尔和塔鲁只是站在座位前，亲眼目睹了他们当时生活中戏剧性的一幕：这个舞台上四肢外张的演员就是鼠疫的化身，而剧院里那些豪华的小装饰品、遗留在红色丝绒椅上的折扇和花边织物此时已变得毫无意义。","Cottard and Tarrou, who had merely risen from their seats, gazed down at what was a dramatic picture of their life in those days: plague on the stage in the guise of a disarticulated mummer, and in the auditorium the toys of luxury, so futile now, forgotten fans and lace shawls derelict on the red plush seats."

"在九月初的那段时间里，朗贝尔一直都尽心尽力地在里厄身边工作着。那天他要去男子中学门口再次与冈萨雷斯和那两个年轻人会面，他也只请了几小时的假。正午时分，冈萨雷斯如约前来，与记者正说着话，那两个小伙子笑着朝他俩走了过来。年轻人说他们上次不走运，但愿将来会有好运。总之，这周没轮到他们值班。朗贝尔还需耐心等到下一周，到时他们再试一试。朗贝尔说做这事确实需要“耐心”。冈萨雷斯提议下周一他和朗贝尔再碰个头，到时朗贝尔最好搬到马塞尔和路易斯家里去住。“你和我再见个面。要是我没来的话，你就直接到他们家去。我会把他们家的地址告诉你。”但马塞尔，抑或是路易斯告诉他，最好现在就带这位朋友去他们家，他日后也就一定可以找到他们家了。如果他不过分挑剔的话，那里的食物足够他们四个人吃的。这样，他做事就会轻车熟路了。冈萨雷斯认为这是个好主意，于是他们四人就朝港口走去。","During the first part of September Rambert had worked conscientiously at Rieux’s side.He had merely asked for a few hours’ leave on the day he was due to meet Gonzales and the two youngsters again outside the boys’ school.Gonzales kept the appointment, at noon, and while he and the journalist were talking, they saw the two boys coming toward them, laughing.They said they’d had no luck last time, but that was only to be expected.Anyhow, it wasn’t their turn for guard duty this week.Rambert must have patience till next week; then they’d have another shot at it.Rambert observed that “patience” certainly was needed in this business.Gonzales suggested they should all meet again on the following Monday, and this time Rambert had better move in to stay with Marcel and Louis.“We’ll make a date, you and I.If I don’t turn up, go straight to their place.I’ll give you the address.”But Marcel, or Louis, told him that the safest thing was to take his pal there right away, then he’d be sure of finding it.If he wasn’t too particular, there was enough grub for the four of them.That way he’d get the hang of things.Gonzales agreed it was a good idea, and the four of them set off toward the harbor."
"马塞尔和路易斯住在海军船坞的外围，离那个通往悬崖栈道的城门口很近。这是一个西班牙式小屋，有几扇喷涂着亮丽油漆的百叶窗和几间阴暗的空屋子。这两个小伙子的母亲是一位笑容可掬、满脸皱纹的西班牙老大妈，她给大家做了米饭。冈萨雷斯感到很惊讶，因为城里缺米已有些时日了。“我们是在城门口设法弄到大米的。”马塞尔解释说。朗贝尔尽情地吃喝了一顿，而冈萨雷斯还说他真是个“他妈的大好人”。事实上，记者一心只想着下周早些到来。","Marcel and Louis lived on the outskirts of the dockyard, near the gate leading to the cliff road.It was a small Spanish house with gaily painted shutters and bare, dark rooms.The boys’ mother, a wrinkled old Spanish woman with a smiling face, produced a dish of which the chief ingredient was rice.Gonzales showed surprise, as rice had been unprocurable for some time in the town.“We fix it up at the gate,” Marcel explained.Rambert ate and drank heartily, and Gonzales informed him he was “a damned good sort.”Actually the journalist was thinking solely of the coming week."
"结果，他还得等上两周，因为为了减少值班班次，每轮值班时间延长至两周。就在这两周期间，朗贝尔不知疲倦地拼命干活，几乎是闭着眼睛从早忙到晚。他很晚才上床睡觉，而且总是一上床便沉睡过去。生活从闲散突然变为忙碌，这种转变使他没了想法，也没了精力。他几乎不提他即将潜逃出城的事。只有一件事值得注意：一周后，他坦白地对医生说，他头一回喝醉了酒。那发生在头天夜里，走出酒吧时，他觉得自己的腹股沟胀得厉害，伸展双臂时腋下也感到疼痛。“我患上鼠疫了！”他想。而他唯一的反应——正如他坦率地向里厄所说的那样，这是种奇怪的反应——就是跑到城市高处的一小块平地上，那里看不到海，但可以看到比较开阔的一片天，他就在那里大声呼喊着他妻子的名字，声音响彻城市上空。一回到家，当他发现自己身上并没有任何感染的征兆时,他为自己之前的那种失控而感到难为情。但里厄却说，受目前形势的影响，人们可能会作出那样的举动，他对此非常理解。“或者说，毕竟，人们很有可能会有这种心理倾向。”","It turned out that he had a fortnight to wait, as the periods of guard duty were extended to two weeks, to reduce the number of shifts.During that fortnight Rambert worked indefatigably, giving every ounce of himself, with his eyes shut, as it were, from dawn till night.He went to bed very late and always slept like a log.This abrupt transition from a life of idleness to one of constant work had left him almost void of thoughts or energy.He talked little about his impending escape.Only one incident is worth noting: after a week he confessed to the doctor that for the first time he’d got really drunk.It was the evening before; on leaving the bar he had an impression that his groin was swollen and he had pains in his armpits when he moved his arms.“I’m in for it!” he thought.And his only reaction—an absurd one, as he frankly admitted to Rieux—had been to start running to the upper town and when he reached a small square, from which if not the sea, a fairly big patch of open sky could be seen, to call to his wife with a great cry, over the walls of the town.On returning home and failing to discover any symptoms of plague on his body, he had felt far from proud of having given way like that.Rieux, however, said he could well understand one’s being moved to act thus.“Or, anyhow, one may easily feel inclined that way.”"
"“今天上午奥顿先生向我谈起了你，”当朗贝尔向里厄道声晚安想要告辞时，里厄突然这样说，“他问我是否认识你，而我告诉他我们认识。于是他说：‘如果你们是朋友，那你就劝劝他不要和走私者们打交道吧。那一定会引起人们的注意的。’”","“Monsieur Othon was talking to me about you this morning,” Rieux suddenly remarked, when Rambert was bidding him good night.“He asked me if I knew you, and I told him I did.Then he said: ‘If he’s a friend of yours advise him not to associate with smugglers.It’s bound to attract attention.’”"
"“什么——意思？”","“Meaning—what?”"
"“这意味着你最好赶紧走。”","“It means you’d better hurry up.”"
"“谢谢。”朗贝尔与医生握手道别。","“Thanks.”Rambert shook the doctor’s hand."
"走到门口，他又突然转过身来。自从爆发鼠疫以来，里厄还是第一次看到朗贝尔露出笑容。","In the doorway he suddenly swung round.Rieux noticed that, for the first time since the outbreak of plague, he was smiling."
"“那你为何不阻止我离开这里呢？你很容易做到这一点的。”","“Then why don’t you stop my going?You could easily manage it.”"
"里厄像平常那样从容地摇了摇头。他说，这是朗贝尔自己的事。既然朗贝尔已经选择了幸福，那么，他里厄就没有反对他的理由。里厄感觉自己也无法判断朗贝尔这样做到底是对还是错。","Rieux shook his head with his usual deliberateness.It was none of his business, he said.Rambert had elected for happiness, and he, Rieux, had no argument to put up against him.Personally he felt incapable of deciding which was the right course and which the wrong in such a case as Rambert’s."
"“既然如此，那你为什么还叫我赶紧走呢？”","“If that’s so, why tell me to hurry up?”"
"这下里厄也笑了。","It was Rieux who now smiled."
"“可能是因为我也想为幸福出点儿力吧。”","“Perhaps because I, too, would like to do my bit for happiness.”"
"第二天，尽管他们大多数时间仍在一起工作，但谁也没有旧话重提。在接下来的那个周日，朗贝尔搬到那幢西班牙小屋去住。那家人给他在客厅里支了张床。由于那对兄弟不回来吃饭，加上他又被告之要尽量少出门，他大多数时间都是独自一人呆在屋里，只是偶尔会和那两位小伙子的母亲聊聊天。她个子纤瘦，身着一袭黑衣，有着一张布满了皱纹的深棕色的脸和一头洁白的头发；她总是忙个不停。她不爱说话，当她看到朗贝尔时，只是朝他亲切地微笑。","Next day, though they were working together most of the time, neither referred to the subject.On the following Sunday Rambert moved into the little Spanish house.He was given a bed in the living-room.As the brothers did not come home for meals and he’d been told to go out as little as possible, he was always alone but for occasional meetings with the boys’ mother.She was a dried-up little wisp of a woman, always dressed in black, busy as a bee, and she had a nut-brown, wrinkled face and immaculately white hair.No great-talker, she merely smiled genially when her eyes fell on Rambert."
"为数不多的一次，她开口问他是否担心会把鼠疫传染给他妻子。他回答说可能会有传染的风险，但风险很小，但如果他呆在这里，那他们很有可能再也无法相见了。","On one of the few occasions when she spoke, it was to ask him if he wasn’t afraid of infecting his wife with plague.He replied that there might be some risk of that, but only a very slight one; while if he stayed in the town, there was a fair chance of their never seeing each other again."
"老大妈微笑着。“她可爱吗？”“很可爱。”","The old woman smiled.“Is she nice?”“Very nice.”"
"“漂亮吗？”","“Pretty?”"
"“我觉得漂亮。”","“I think so.”"
"“啊，”她点点头说，“就是出于这原因呀。”","“Ah,” she nodded, “that explains it.”"
"朗贝尔想了想。这确实是个原因，但不可能只是出于这一个原因。","Rambert reflected.No doubt that explained it, but it was impossible that that alone explained it."
"这位老大妈每天上午都要去做弥撒。她问朗贝尔：“难道你不信天主吗？”","The old woman went to Mass every morning.“Don’t you believe in God?” she asked him."
"朗贝尔承认他不信天主，于是她又说“就是出于这个原因”。“是的，”她接着说，“你是对的。你应该回到她的身边。要不然——你还有什么指望呢？”","On Rambert’s admitting he did not, she said again that “that explained it.”“Yes,” she added, “you’re right.You must go back to her.Or else—what would be left you?”"
"大多数时间，朗贝尔都是在屋子里转来转去，或者茫然地望着粉刷了的墙壁，或者无聊地摸摸墙上的扇子，它们是墙上唯一的装饰，又或者数数桌布边缘垂着的羊毛小球。晚上，小伙子们回来了；他俩话不多，只是说时机还不成熟。晚饭后，马塞尔弹着吉他，大家喝着茴香酒。朗贝尔看起来心事重重。","Rambert spent most of the day prowling round the room, gazing vaguely at the distempered walls, idly fingering the fans that were their only decoration, or counting the woolen balls on the tablecloth fringe.In the evening the youngsters came home; they hadn’t much to say, except that the time hadn’t come yet.After dinner Marcel played the guitar, and they drank an anise-flavored liqueur.Rambert seemed lost in thought."
"周三那天，马塞尔宣布说：“就在明天午夜行动。请准时做好准备。”他解释说，与他们一起值班的另外两个人中有一人患了鼠疫，而与这个患者同住一屋的另一人正在接受隔离观察。因此，在两三天内，只有马塞尔和路易斯两人值班。他们会在当晚安排好最后的细节问题，而朗贝尔可以放心，他们会帮忙帮到底的。朗贝尔对他们表示感谢。","On Wednesday Marcel announced: “It’s for tomorrow night, at midnight.Be ready on time.”Of the two men sharing the sentry post with them, he explained, one had got plague and the other, who had slept in the same room, was now under observation.Thus for two or three days Marcel and Louis would be alone at the post.They’d fix up the final details in the course of the night, and he could count on them to see it through.Rambert thanked them."
"“高兴吗？”老大妈问。","“Pleased?” the old woman asked."
"他嘴里说是，但心里却想着别的事。","He said yes, but his thoughts were elsewhere."
"第二天，气温很高，天气闷热潮湿，一层热气遮住了太阳。死亡人数又有所上升。但这位西班牙老大妈仍然很镇静。“世上的罪恶太多，”她说，“所以你又能指望什么呢？”","The next day was very hot and muggy and a heat-mist veiled the sun.The total of deaths had jumped up.But the old Spanish woman lost nothing of her serenity.“There’s so much wickedness in the world,” she said.“So what can you expect?”"
"同马塞尔和路易斯一样，朗贝尔光着膀子。但是，即使这样，他还是汗流浃背。在百叶窗紧闭、光线昏暗的屋子里，他们的上身就像是精心打磨过的红木一般。朗贝尔就像一只困兽似的在屋子里一声不吭地转来转去。下午四点时，他突然说他要出去。","Like Marcel and Louis, Rambert was stripped to the waist.But, even so, sweat was trickling down his chest and between his shoulder-blades.In the dim light of the shuttered room their torsos glowed like highly polished mahogany.Rambert kept prowling round like a caged animal, without speaking.Abruptly at four in the afternoon he announced that he was going out."
"“要记住，”马塞尔说，“午夜准时行动。一切都已安排妥当。”","“Don’t forget,” Marcel said.“At midnight sharp.Everything’s set.”"
"朗贝尔去了医生家里。里厄的母亲告诉他，可以在城北的医院里找到医生。与以往一样，医院门口总有一群人转来转去。“走，到那边去！”一个长着金鱼眼的警官每隔几分钟就大声嚷嚷一次。人群在不断走动，但总是围成一个圈。“聚集在这儿是没有用的。”这位警官的上衣已经被汗水湿透了。人们知道这样做“没用”，但他们不顾炎热，还是继续呆在那里。朗贝尔向警官出示了他的通行证，警官就让他去塔鲁的办公室。","Rambert went to the doctor’s apartment.Rieux’s mother told him he would find the doctor at the hospital in the upper town.As before, a crowd was circling in front of the entrance gates.“Move on, there!” a police sergeant with bulging eyes bawled every few minutes.And the crowd kept moving, but always in a circle.“No use hanging round here.”The sergeant’s coat was soaked in sweat.They knew it was “no use,” but they stayed on, despite the devastating heat.Rambert showed his pass to the sergeant, who told him to go to Tarrou’s office."
"办公室的门朝院子开着。他与刚从办公室出来的帕纳卢神父擦肩而过。塔鲁坐在一张黑色的木桌旁，挽着衣服袖子，正用手帕擦着臂弯里的汗珠。这间办公室，一间白色小屋，弥漫着药品和湿布的味道。","Its door opened on the courtyard.He passed Father Paneloux, who was coming out of the office.Tarrou was sitting at a black wood desk, with his sleeves rolled up, mopping up with his handkerchief a trickle of sweat in the bend of his arm.The office, a small, white-painted room, smelt of drugs and damp cloth."
"“你还在这儿？”塔鲁问。","“Still here?” asked Tarrou."
"“对。我想和里厄聊一聊。”","“Yes. I’d like to have a word with Rieux.”"
"“他在病房里。喂！要是你自己能解决问题的话，你可以不去找他吗？”","“He’s in the ward.Look here! Don’t you think you could fix up whatever you’ve come for without seeing him?”"
"“为什么？”","“Why?”"
"“他太忙了。我要尽量减轻他的工作。”","“He’s overdoing it.I spare him as much as I can.”"
"朗贝尔仔细地看了看塔鲁。他变瘦了，两眼无光，脸上写满了倦意，宽宽的肩膀也塌了下来。这时响起了敲门声。一个戴着白口罩的男护士走了进来。他把一小摞病历卡放在塔鲁的办公桌上，隔着口罩嘟噜着说了声“六个”，接着便走了出去。塔鲁看看记者，接着又给他展示了那些摊成扇形的病历卡。","Rambert gazed thoughtfully at Tarrou.He’d grown thinner, his eyes and features were blurred with fatigue, his broad shoulders sagged.There was a knock at the door.A male attendant, wearing a white mask, entered.He laid a little sheaf of cards on Tarrou’s desk and, his voice coming thickly through the cloth, said: “Six,” then went out.Tarrou looked at the journalist and showed him the cards, spreading them fanwise."
"“整齐的小卡片，对吧？唉，它们却代表着死亡。昨晚又有人死去了。”他皱着眉头，把病历卡收了起来。“留给我们唯一的事情便是结账啦！”","“Neat little gadgets, aren’t they?Well, they’re deaths.Last night’s deaths.”Frowning, he slipped the cards together.“The only thing that’s left us is accountancy!”"
"塔鲁收拾好桌上的东西，站了起来。","Taking his purchase on the table, Tarrou rose to his feet."
"“我想，你马上就要动身了吧？”","“You’re off quite soon, I take it?”"
"“今晚，午夜时分。”","“Tonight, at midnight.”"
"塔鲁说，他很高兴听到这个消息，并要朗贝尔多加保重。","Tarrou said he was glad to hear it, and Rambert had better look after himself for a bit."
"“你说的是——真心话吗？”","“Did you say that-sincerely?”"
"塔鲁耸了耸肩膀。","Tarrou shrugged his shoulders."
"“我这把年纪的人说的都是真心话。撒谎太累了。”","“At my age one’s got to be sincere.Lying’s too much effort.”"
"“对不起，塔鲁，”记者说，“我很想见见医生。”","“Excuse me, Tarrou,” the journalist said, “but I’d greatly like to see the doctor.”"
"“我知道。他比我更通人情。好吧，请跟我来。”","“I know.He’s more human than I.All right, come along.”"
"“不是这样的。”朗贝尔结巴着说，话音突然打住了。","“It’s not that.” Rambert stumbled over his words and broke off."
"塔鲁盯着朗贝尔，接着，出人意料地，他的脸上露出了一丝笑容。","Tarrou stared at him; then, unexpectedly, his face broke into a smile."
"他们沿着一条小走廊往前走，走廊两边的墙壁上涂着浅绿色的墙漆，反射出蓝绿色的光，就像在水族馆一样。他们就要走到走廊尽头那两扇玻璃门前时，可以隐约看见门后有人走动，而塔鲁把朗贝尔带进了一个四周摆满了壁橱的小房间。塔鲁打开一个壁橱，从消毒器里取了两只纱布口罩，递给了朗贝尔一只，并叫他戴上。","They walked down a narrow passage; the walls were painted pale green, and the light was glaucous, like that in an aquarium.Before they reached the glazed double door at the end of the passage, behind which shadowy forms could be seen moving, Tarrou took Rambert into a small room, all the wall space of which was occupied by cupboards.Opening one of these, he took from a sterilizer two masks of cotton-wool enclosed in muslin, handed one to Rambert, and told him to put it on."
"记者问这样做是否真的有用。塔鲁说这样做不起作用，但可以让别人放心。","The journalist asked if it was really any use.Tarrou said no, but it inspired confidence in others."
"他们将玻璃门推开。映入眼帘的是间很大的屋子，尽管天气炎热，所有的窗户都关着。天花板上的几个吊扇嗡嗡作响，搅动着长长的两排灰色病床上空那混浊而又炎热的空气。屋里呻吟声或尖叫声此起彼伏，汇成了单调的好似哀乐的副歌。从装有木栅栏的高高的窗口泻进来一股耀眼的光线，几个穿着白大褂的男子在病床间慢慢地走动着。病房里的酷热使朗贝尔感到很难受，他几乎没有认出那个弯腰站在一个不断呻吟着的病人身边的人就是里厄。医生正在切开病人的腹股沟，而病床两边各有一名护士帮着把病人的两腿分开。不久后，里厄直起身子，把手术器械放进了助手递过来的一个托盘里，呆在原地站了一会儿，低头凝视着这个正在接受包扎的病人。","They opened the glazed door.It led into a very large room, all the windows of which were shut, in spite of the great heat.Electric fans buzzed near the ceiling, churning up the stagnant, overheated air above two long rows of gray beds.Groans shrill or stifled rose on all sides, blending in a monotonous dirgelike refrain.Men in white moved slowly from bed to bed under the garish light flooding in from high, barred windows.The appalling heat in the ward made Rambert ill at ease, and he had difficulty in recognizing Rieux, who was bending over a groaning form.The doctor was lancing the patient’s groin, while two nurses, one on each side, held his legs apart.Presently Rieux straightened up, dropped his instruments into a tray that an attendant held out to him, and remained without moving for some moments, gazing down at the man, whose wound was now being dressed."
"“有消息吗？”塔鲁走到医生身旁时医生问他。","“Any news?” he asked Tarrou, who had come beside him."
"“帕纳卢准备接替朗贝尔在隔离观察站的工作。他已经做了许多有用的工作。朗贝尔走后剩下的工作就只差重组第三分队而已。”","“Paneloux is prepared to replace Rambert at the quarantine station.He has put in a lot of useful work already.All that remains is to reorganize group number three, now that Rambert’s going.”"
"里厄点了点头。","Rieux nodded."
"“卡斯特尔已经准备好了第一批血清，”塔鲁接着说，“他赞成马上投入试用。”","“Castel has his first lot of serum ready now,” Tarrou continued.“He’s in favor of its being tried at once.”"
"“太棒了，”里厄说，“这是个好消息。”","“Good,” Rieux said.“That’s good news.”"
"“还有，朗贝尔来了。”","“And Rambert’s come.”"
"里厄四处张望了一下。当他看到记者时，他露在口罩上面的那双眼睛眯了起来。","Rieux looked round.His eyes narrowed above the mask when he saw the journalist."
"“你为什么过来？”他问，“你不是应该在别的地方吗？”","“Why have you come?” he asked.“Surely you should be elsewhere?”"
"塔鲁解释说，朗贝尔已定好当天午夜动身，对此朗贝尔加了一句：“不管怎样，想是这么想的。”","Tarrou explained that it was fixed for midnight, to which Rambert added: “That’s the idea, anyhow.”"
"每当他们中间有人透着口罩说话时，口罩外面的纱布就会鼓起来，而罩着嘴唇的那块地方也变得湿润起来。这样的谈话让人有种不真实的感觉，这就像是雕像间的谈话。","Whenever any of them spoke through the mask, the muslin bulged and grew moist over the lips.This gave a sort of unreality to the conversation; it was like a colloquy of statues."
"“我想同你聊一聊。”朗贝尔说。","“I’d like to have a word with you,” Rambert said."
"“好的。我就来。请到塔鲁的办公室等我。”","“Right.I’m just going.Wait for me in Tarrou’s office.”"
"过了一会儿，朗贝尔和里厄坐在了里厄汽车的后座上。塔鲁握着方向盘，发动汽车时四下看了看。","A minute or so later Rambert and Rieux were sitting at the back of the doctor’s car.Tarrou, who was at the wheel, looked round as he let in the gear."
"“快没油了，”他说，“明天我们就要艰难步行了。”","“Gas is running out,” he said.“We’ll have to foot-slog it tomorrow.”"
"“医生，”朗贝尔说，“我不走了。我想留下来跟你们干。”","“Doctor,” Rambert said, “I’m not going.I want to stay with you.”"
"塔鲁没作任何回应，他继续开车。里厄似乎还没有摆脱疲劳。","Tarrou made no movement; he went on driving.Rieux seemed unable to shake off his fatigue."
"“那她怎么办呢？”他的声音低得几乎听不到。","“And what about her?”His voice was hardly audible."
"朗贝尔说，他已经仔细考虑过了，他的想法并没有改变，但如果离开这里，他会为自己感到羞耻，而这又会影响他和他所爱的那个女人之间的关系。","Rambert said he’d thought it over very carefully, and his views hadn’t changed, but if he went away, he would feel ashamed of himself, and that would embarrass his relations with the woman he loved."
"里厄打起精神，说那完全是胡说八道，选择幸福并没有什么可耻的。","Showing more animation, Rieux told him that was sheer nonsense; there was nothing shameful in preferring happiness."
"“当然，”朗贝尔回答说，“但如果只想着自己的幸福，那可能就有些可耻了。”","“Certainly,” Rambert replied.“But it may be shameful to be happy by oneself.”"
"这时，一直没有吭声的塔鲁头也不回地说，如果朗贝尔想要分担别人的不幸，那他就没有时间去顾及自己的幸福。因此他得作出选择。","Tarrou, who had not spoken so far, now remarked, without turning his head, that if Rambert wished to take a share in other people’s unhappiness, he’d have no time left for happiness.So the choice had to be made."
"“不是这样养的，”朗贝尔反驳道，“我一直觉得自己是个外乡人，我与你们这些人毫无关系。但由于我的亲眼所见，我明白自己也是这里的一分子，不管我愿意还是不愿意。这是大家的事情。”看到没有一人回答，朗贝尔好像有些生气了。“你们和我一样都很清楚这一点，该死的！否则你们在你们的医院里忙什么？你们明确地作出了选择，放弃了幸福吗？”","“That’s not it,” Rambert rejoined.“Until now I always felt a stranger in this town, and that I’d no concern with you people.But now that I’ve seen what I have seen, I know that I belong here whether I want it or not.This business is everybody’s business.”When there was no reply from either of the others, Rambert seemed to grow annoyed.“But you know that as well as I do, damn it!Or else what are you up to in that hospital of yours?Have you made a definite choice and turned down happiness?”"
"里厄和塔鲁还是一言不发，接下来大家都沉默不语，直到汽车驶近医生家。朗贝尔重又提起他问的最后那个问题，语气却更重了。","Rieux and Tarrou still said nothing, and the silence lasted until they were at the doctor’s home.Then Rambert repeated his last question in a yet more emphatic tone."
"就在这时，里厄朝他转过身去，费力地从靠垫上直起了身子。","Only then Rieux turned toward him, raising himself with an effort from the cushion."
"“请原谅我，朗贝尔，只是——唉，你的问题我真不知道怎么回答。不过，只要你愿意，就留下来跟着我们干吧。”车子一个急转弯打断了他的话。接着，他凝视着前方说：“世界上没有什么东西值得人们为之背弃自己的所爱。但我就是这样做的，尽管我也不清楚这是为什么。”他又把身子倒在了靠垫上。","“Forgive me, Rambert, only—well, I simply don’t know.But stay with us if you want to.”A swerve of the car made him break off.Then, looking straight in front of him, he said: “For nothing in the world is it worth turning one’s back on what one loves.Yet that is what I’m doing, though why I do not know.”He sank back on the cushion."
"“这就是现实，”他疲惫地说，“我们对此无能为力。所以，就让我们面对现实，得出结论吧。”","“That’s how it is,” he added wearily, “and there’s nothing to be done about it.So let’s recognize the fact and draw the conclusions.”"
"“什么结论？”","“What conclusions?”"
"“啊，”里厄说，“人们不可能在医治病人的同时就知道结果。因此，还是让我们尽快给人治病吧。这才是当务之急。”","“Ah,” Rieux said, “a man can’t cure and know at the same time.So let’s cure as quickly as we can.That’s the more urgent job.”"
"午夜时，塔鲁和里厄正在向朗贝尔解释他将要负责监管的那个区的地图。塔鲁瞥了一眼自己的手表。一抬头，他和朗贝尔两人的目光碰到了一起。","At midnight Tarrou and Rieux were giving Rambert the map of the district he was to keep under surveillance.Tarrou glanced at his watch.Looking up, he met Rambert’s gaze."
"“你已经告诉他们了吗？”他问。","“Have you let them know?” he asked."
"记者将目光移开。","The journalist looked away."
"“在我来这之前，”他费力地说，“我已经叫人给他们送去了一张便条。”","“I’d sent them a note”—he spoke with an effort—“before coming to see you.”"
"第二十章","Chapter 20"
"十月底，卡斯特尔研制的抗鼠疫血清首次投入试用。老实说，这是里厄最后的办法了。如果试验失败，医生就确信整座城市将会任由瘟疫摆布；这场鼠疫或者继续肆虐，时间不可预知，又或者可能突然间自行消失。","Toward the close of October Castel’s anti-plague serum was tried for the first time.Practically speaking, it was Rieux’s last card.If it failed, the doctor was convinced the whole town would be at the mercy of the epidemic, which would either continue its ravages for an unpredictable period or perhaps die out abruptly of its own accord."
"在卡斯特尔前去拜访里厄的前一天，奥顿先生的儿子病倒了，而全家人都不得不接受隔离观察。因此，这位刚结束隔离的母亲又再一次陷入孤独之中。这位地方治安官遵从官方的规定，一发现他的小儿子身上出现了病征，就立即派人去请里厄医生。里厄进屋时，这对父母正站在儿子的床边。男孩正处于极度衰竭的阶段，在医生给他作检查时，他也没有发出一点儿声音。里厄一抬头就看到治安官正注视着他，还有他身后那位母亲苍白的脸。她用手帕捂着嘴，睁着两只大眼睛注视着医生的一举一动。","The day before Castel called on Rieux, M. Othon’s son had fallen ill and all the family had to go into quarantine.Thus the mother, who had only recently come out of it, found herself isolated once again.In deference to the official regulations the magistrate had promptly sent for Dr. Rieux the moment he saw symptoms of the disease in his little boy.Mother and father were standing at the bedside when Rieux entered the room.The boy was in the phase of extreme prostration and submitted without a whimper to the doctor’s examination.When Rieux raised his eyes he saw the magistrate’s gaze intent on him, and, behind, the mother’s pale face.She was holding a handkerchief to her mouth, and her big, dilated eyes followed each of the doctor’s movements."
"“他患了鼠疫，对吧？”治安官用平淡的声调问道。","“He has it, I suppose?” the magistrate asked in a toneless voice."
"“对。”里厄低头又看了看孩子。","“Yes.” Rieux gazed down at the child again."
"这位母亲的眼睛睁得更大了，但她还是一言不发。奥顿先生也沉默了一会儿，接着才更小声地说：“嗯，医生，我们应该按要求行事。”","The mother’s eyes widened yet more, but she still said nothing.M. Othon, too, kept silent for a while before saying in an even lower tone: “Well, doctor, we must do as we are told to do.”"
"里厄不去看奥顿太太，她这时还在用手帕捂着嘴。","Rieux avoided looking at Mme Othon, who was still holding her handkerchief to her mouth."
"“能否借用一下你的电话？”他有点局促不安地说，“不用很长时间。”","“It needn’t take long,” he said rather awkwardly, “if you’ll let me use your phone.”"
"治安官说他这就带医生去打电话。但在临走前，医生转向奥顿太太。","The magistrate said he would take him to the telephone.But before going, the doctor turned toward Mme Othon."
"“我确实感到很遗憾，但恐怕你还得作些准备。你知道该怎样做。”","“I regret very much indeed, but I’m afraid you’ll have to get your things ready.You know how it is.”"
"奥顿太太似乎有些惊慌失措。她盯着地板。","Mme Othon seemed disconcerted.She was staring at the floor."
"“我知道，”她接着慢慢地点了点头，低声说，“我会马上准备好的。”","Then, “I understand,” she murmured, slowly nodding her head.“I’ll set about it at once.”"
"走之前，里厄突然问起奥顿夫妇是否需要他帮忙。这位母亲默默地看着他。而此时治安官却将目光移开。","Before leaving, Rieux on a sudden impulse asked the Othons if there wasn’t anything they’d like him to do for them.The mother gazed at him in silence.And now the magistrate averted his eyes."
"“不需要，”他说，费劲地吞了一口唾液，“但是——请救救我的儿子。”","“No,” he said, then swallowed hard.“But—save my son.”"
"隔离在鼠疫初期只是一种形式，但现在里厄和朗贝尔已经重新非常严格地组织起了隔离。","In the early days a mere formality, quarantine had now been reorganized by Rieux and Rambert on very strict lines."
"特别是他们坚决要求病人的家人都要分开隔离。假如有一个家庭成员不知不觉地染上了鼠疫，就不能让传染的风险进一步增加。里厄向治安官解释了这一点，治安官也认同了这种做法。然而，治安官与他妻子相互之间的深情一瞥却使里厄意识到，这对夫妻突然面临这种分离时是多么难舍难分。奥顿太太和她的小女儿可以住在朗贝尔负责的隔离医院里。但是，对于这位治安官，他只能住进当局在市体育场里用公路局提供的帐篷搭建起来的隔离营里，别无他处。当里厄为这种简陋的住宿条件而感到抱歉时，奥顿先生却回答说，规定对所有人都是一视同仁的，因此大家都应该遵守。男孩被送到辅助医院，住进了一间摆放了十张床的病房，那里以前是间教室。大约二十个小时后，里厄确信男孩的病没有指望了。感染在男孩的体内逐步扩散，他的身体已经无力反抗了。他那瘦弱的四肢关节处满是淋巴腺肿块，虽然很小，还刚刚形成，却非常疼痛。这病显然是无法医治了。","In particular they insisted on having members of the family of a patient kept apart.If, unawares, one of them had been infected, the risks of an extension of the infection must not be multiplied.Rieux explained this to the magistrate, who signified his approval of the procedure.Nevertheless, he and his wife exchanged a glance that made it clear to Rieux how keenly they both felt the separation thus imposed on them.Mme Othon and her little girl could be given rooms in the quarantine hospital under Rambert’s charge.For the magistrate, however, no accommodation was available except in an isolation camp the authorities were now installing in the municipal stadium, using tents supplied by the highway department.When Rieux apologized for the poor accommodation, M. Othon replied that there was one rule for all alike, and it was only proper to abide by it.The boy was taken to the auxiliary hospital and put in a ward of ten beds which had formerly been a classroom.After some twenty hours Rieux became convinced that the case was hopeless.The infection was steadily spreading, and the boy’s body putting up no resistance.Tiny, half-formed, but acutely painful buboes were clogging the joints of the child’s puny limbs.Obviously it was a losing fight."
"在这种情况下，里厄毫不犹豫地决定在男孩身上试用卡斯特尔研制的血清。当天晚上晚饭后，它们实施了接种，在这个漫长的过程中男孩没有丝毫反应。第二天黎明，大家围拢到病床前，观察这被寄予厚望的试验性接种的效果。孩子脱离了完全不省人事的状态，正在床上翻来覆去地抽搐着。从清晨四点钟开始，卡斯特尔医生和塔鲁一直都在观察、记录着每个阶段病情的起色。在床头，塔鲁健硕的身体微微弯着，而在床尾，卡斯特尔坐在那儿，似乎非常平静地阅读着一本皮质封面的书籍，里厄则站在他身旁。天越来越亮了，其他人也一个接一个地来到这间曾是教室的病房里。最先到的是帕纳卢，他在床的另一头面对着塔鲁靠墙站着。他的脸上流露出悲伤与长期疲惫的神情，几个星期来他一直忙个不停，从没休息过。他那有点突出的前额上布满了深深的皱纹。接着格朗也来了。这时已是七点，他气喘吁吁地走来，向大家表示道歉；他只能呆一会儿，但想知道是否已经观察到任何明确的疗效。里厄没有吭声，用手指了指孩子。孩子闭着眼睛，咬紧牙关，痛苦不堪地僵着身子，他的脑袋则在长枕上不停地来回转动着。房间另一头的墙上挂着一块黑板，当光线足以照亮黑板上被抹去了一半的方程式的字迹时，朗贝尔进来了。他来到孩子邻床的床尾，从口袋里掏出一包香烟来。但他瞥了一眼孩子的脸之后，又把烟放回到口袋里。","Under the circumstances Rieux had no qualms about testing Castel’s serum on the boy.That night, after dinner, they performed the inoculation, a lengthy process, without getting the slightest reaction.At daybreak on the following day they gathered round the bed to observe the effects of this test inoculation on which so much hung.The child had come out of his extreme prostration and was tossing about convulsively on the bed.From four in the morning Dr. Castel and Tarrou had been keeping watch and noting, stage by stage, the progress and remissions of the malady.Tarrou’s bulky form was slightly drooping at the head of the bed, while at its foot, with Rieux standing beside him, Castel was seated, reading, with every appearance of calm, an old leatherbound book.One by one, as the light increased in the former classroom, the others arrived.Paneloux, the first to come, leaned against the wall on the opposite side of the bed to Tarrou.His face was drawn with grief, and the accumulated weariness of many weeks, during which he had never spared himself, had deeply seamed his somewhat prominent forehead.Grand came next.It was seven o’clock, and he apologized for being out of breath; he could only stay a moment, but wanted to know if any definite results had been observed.Without speaking, Rieux pointed to the child.His eyes shut, his teeth clenched, his features frozen in an agonized grimace, he was rolling his head from side to side on the bolster.When there was just light enough to make out the half-obliterated figures of an equation chalked on a blackboard that still hung on the wall at the far end of the room, Rambert entered.Posting himself at the foot of the next bed, he took a package of cigarettes from his pocket.But after his first glance at the child’s face he put it back."
"卡斯特尔坐在椅子上，从眼镜的上方看了看里厄。","From his chair Castel looked at Rieux over his spectacles."
"“有他父亲的消息吗？”","“Any news of his father?”"
"“没有，”里厄说，“他住在隔离营里。”","“No,” said Rieux.“He’s in the isolation camp.”"
"里厄双手抓住床架横杆，目不转睛地看着这个饱受折磨的小家伙。孩子的身子突然绷得紧紧的，弓到腰部时又似乎有点松弛了下来，接着四肢慢慢地展开成X形。那盖着军用毛毯的赤裸的小身体散发出一股受潮羊毛和汗臭的气味。男孩又咬紧了牙关。渐渐地他才松弛了下来，四肢也向床中央并拢了起来，但他依然紧闭双眼，一声不吭，而呼吸似乎变得急促起来。里厄看了看塔鲁，而塔鲁却很快低下了他的目光。","The doctor’s hands were gripping the rail of the bed, his eyes fixed on the small tortured body.Suddenly it stiffened, and seemed to give a little at the waist, as slowly the arms and legs spread out X-wise.From the body, naked under an army blanket, rose a smell of damp wool and stale sweat.The boy had gritted his teeth again.Then very gradually he relaxed, bringing his arms and legs back toward the center of the bed, still without speaking or opening his eyes, and his breathing seemed to quicken.Rieux looked at Tarrou, who hastily lowered his eyes."
"他们看过孩子们死去——数月来，鼠疫已不再选择特定的侵害对象了——但他们还从未像今天这样，从黎明开始就一刻不停地看着孩子遭受折磨。不用说，对这些无辜的孩子所遭受的痛苦折磨，他们似乎一直都认为——这事可恶之极。但在这以前，可以说，他们只是抽象地觉得这很可恶，他们从未像今天这样长时间地看着一个无辜的孩子垂死挣扎。","They had already seen children die—for many months now death had shown no favoritism—but they had never yet watched a child’s agony minute by minute, as they had now been doing since daybreak.Needless to say, the pain inflicted on these innocent victims had always seemed to them to be what in fact it was: an abominable thing.But hitherto they had felt its abomination in, so to speak, an abstract way; they had never had to witness over so long a period the death-throes of an innocent child."
"就在这时，男孩又突然抽搐起来，他的肚子似乎正被什么东西啃咬着，嘴里发出一声长长的尖厉的号叫。好一阵子，他都奇怪地弓着身子，不断地痉挛着，他那脆弱的身子似乎被鼠疫的狂风刮弯了腰，又被卷土重来的一阵高烧击裂开来。狂风一过，一切暂时平静了下来，他也稍微放松了些。高烧似乎已经退去，他就像被抛弃在潮湿的瘟疫的海滩上，喘着气，无力地躺在那里，看起来就像死了一般。当高烧第三次向他袭来，使他微微坐起些身子时，他似乎在高烧的威逼之下弓着身子缩到床沿，四肢不停地颤抖着。他的头疯狂地摇来摇去，过了一会儿，他突然把毯子给掀掉了。大颗大颗的眼泪从红肿的眼皮底下涌了出来，又顺着铅灰色的凹陷的脸颊流了下去。这阵发作过后，这个完全筋疲力尽的孩子伸着瘦骨嶙峋的两条腿和两天内就瘦得皮包骨头的两只胳膊，平躺在这张乱糟糟的床上，摆出一副怪异的钉死于十字架的造型。","And just then the boy had a sudden spasm, as if something had bitten him in the stomach, and uttered a long, shrill wail.For moments that seemed endless he stayed in a queer, contorted position, his body racked by convulsive tremors; it was as if his frail frame were bending before the fierce breath of the plague, breaking under the reiterated gusts of fever.Then the storm-wind passed, there came a lull, and he relaxed a little; the fever seemed to recede, leaving him gasping for breath on a dank, pestilential shore, lost in a languor that already looked like death.When for the third time the fiery wave broke on him, lifting him a little, the child curled himself up and shrank away to the edge of the bed, as if in terror of the flames advancing on him, licking his limbs.A moment later, after tossing his head wildly to and fro, he flung off the blanket.From between the inflamed eyelids big tears welled up and trickled down the sunken, leaden-hued cheeks.When the spasm had passed, utterly exhausted, tensing his thin legs and arms, on which, within forty-eight hours, the flesh had wasted to the bone, the child lay flat, racked on the tumbled bed, in a grotesque parody of crucifixion."
"塔鲁俯下身去，用他的大手轻轻地拭去小脸蛋上的眼泪与汗水。卡斯特尔刚把他的书合上，这会儿正凝视着孩子。他刚一开口，就因为嗓音太粗而不得不清了清嗓子才继续往下说。","Bending, Tarrou gently stroked with his big paw the small face stained with tears and sweat.Castel had closed his book a few moments before, and his eyes were now fixed on the child.He began to speak, but had to give a cough before continuing, because his voice rang out so harshly."
"“里厄，今天早晨孩子的病情没有任何缓解，是吗？”","“There wasn’t any remission this morning, was there, Rieux?”"
"里厄摇了摇头，但他接着又说，这孩子的忍耐力比想象的要强。靠墙站着的帕纳卢低声说：“这样一来，假如孩子终究会死去的话，他受苦的时间反倒更长。”病房里的光线更亮了。其他九张床上的病人在摇晃着、呻吟着，但似乎都在刻意压低着自己的声音。只有一位住在病房尽头的病人在尖叫着，每隔一段时间就发出些叫喊声，似乎更像是惊叫而不像痛苦的哀号。的确，似乎病人也已不像当初那样极度恐惧了，现在他们对这种疾病抱着一种悲观顺从的态度。只有这孩子还在继续拼尽全力与之抗衡。里厄时而不时地为孩子号号脉——这样做并非有什么用处，更多的是为了摆脱自己这种无望的情绪——当他闭上自己的双眼时，似乎感觉到孩子的躁动使自己也热血沸腾起来。那个时候，他觉得自己与这个饱受折磨的孩子已融为一体，因此试图用尽自己所剩的全部力量去扶持这个孩子。但是，他们两人这种心跳同步的状态仅仅维持了几分钟就不协调了，这孩子躲开了他，他再次感到无能为力。随后，他松开孩子那纤细的手腕，回到原地站着。映在病房白色墙面上的阳光正从粉红色变成了黄色。新的一天里的第一股热浪正透过窗户向屋内袭来。格朗转身离开时说他还会回来，但大家几乎没有听见。大家都在等待着。孩子依然双眼紧闭，但似乎变得平静了些。他那爪子似的双手无力地垂放在床的两侧。然后，他抬起双手，去抓盖在他膝盖上的毯子，又突然蜷起双腿，直到大腿抵至腹部才停止不动。他第一次睁开了双眼，凝视着突然站到他跟前来的里厄。那张小脸，好似一张灰色的粘土面具，绷得紧紧的，嘴巴慢慢张开，发出了一声长长的尖叫，这叫声几乎没有因呼吸而间断，于是整个病房充斥着一种强烈的、愤怒的抗议声。这不像是一个孩子发出的声音，而像是那里所有病人发出的集体抗议声。","Rieux shook his head, adding, however, that the child was putting up more resistance than one would have expected.Paneloux, who was slumped against the wall, said in a low voice: “So if he is to die, he will have suffered longer.”Light was increasing in the ward.The occupants of the other nine beds were tossing about and groaning, but in tones that seemed deliberately subdued.Only one, at the far end of the ward, was screaming, or rather uttering little exclamations at regular intervals, which seemed to convey surprise more than pain.Indeed, one had the impression that even for the sufferers the frantic terror of the early phase had passed, and there was a sort of mournful resignation in their present attitude toward the disease.Only the child went on fighting with all his little might.Now and then Rieux took his pulse—less because this served any purpose than as an escape from his utter helplessness—and when he closed his eyes, he seemed to feel its tumult mingling with the fever of his own blood.And then, at one with the tortured child, he struggled to sustain him with all the remaining strength of his own body.But, linked for a few moments, the rhythms of their heartbeats soon fell apart, the child escaped him, and again he knew his impotence.Then he released the small, thin wrist and moved back to his place.The light on the whitewashed walls was changing from pink to yellow.The first waves of another day of heat were beating on the windows.They hardly heard Grand saying he would come back as he turned to go.All were waiting.The child, his eyes still closed, seemed to grow a little calmer.His clawlike fingers were feebly plucking at the sides of the bed.Then they rose, scratched at the blanket over his knees, and suddenly he doubled up his limbs, bringing his thighs above his stomach, and remained quite still.For the first time he opened his eyes and gazed at Rieux, who was standing immediately in front of him.In the small face, rigid as a mask of grayish clay, slowly the lips parted and from them rose a long, incessant scream, hardly varying with his respiration, and filling the ward with a fierce, indignant protest, so little childish that it seemed like a collective voice issuing from all the sufferers there."
"里厄咬紧牙关，塔鲁则掉过头去。朗贝尔走过去站到了卡斯特尔的身旁，而卡斯特尔也合上了摊开在他膝盖上的那本书。帕纳卢低头看着孩子那张小嘴，孩子的嘴里满是鼠疫产生的污秽物。孩子还不断地发出那种愤怒的号叫声；这声音响彻了人类的数个世纪。帕纳卢跪倒在地，在那不可名状、连续不断的哀号声中，在场的所有人自然而然地听到他用沙哑却很清晰的声音说：","Rieux clenched his jaws, Tarrou looked away.Rambert went and stood beside Castel, who closed the book lying on his knees.Paneloux gazed down at the small mouth, fouled with the sordes of the plague and pouring out the angry death-cry that has sounded through the ages of mankind.He sank on his knees, and all present found it natural to hear him say in a voice hoarse but clearly audible across that nameless, never ending wail: "
"“主啊，救救这孩子吧！”","“My God, spare this child!”"
"但孩子仍在不停地哀号着，而其他病人也开始骚动起来。住在病房尽头的那位每隔一段时间就叫喊一声的病人现在加快了叫喊的节奏，那些断断续续的喊叫现在变成了一声长号，而其他人的呻吟声也变得越来越大，一阵呜咽在病房里泛滥，淹没了帕纳卢的祷告声，而里厄依然紧紧抓住床架横杆，双眼紧闭，因疲劳和憎恶而感到头晕目眩。","But the wail continued without cease and the other sufferers began to grow restless.The patient at the far end of the ward, whose little broken cries had gone on without a break, now quickened their tempo so that they flowed together in one unbroken cry, while the others’ groans grew louder.A gust of sobs swept through the room, drowning Paneloux’s prayer, and Rieux, who was still tightly gripping the rail of the bed, shut his eyes, dazed with exhaustion and disgust."
"当里厄睁开双眼时，发现塔鲁在他身旁。","When he opened them again, Tarrou was at his side."
"“我必须走了，”里厄说，“我再也听不下去了。”","“I must go,” Rieux said.“I can’t bear to hear them any longer.”"
"但就在这时，其他病人突然安静了下来。医生这才发现孩子的哀号声越来越弱，现在已经一声不吭了。他周围的病人又开始呻吟起来，但声音更小了，就像是从远方传来的刚刚结束的这场斗争的回声。这场斗争已经结束了。卡斯特尔已走到病床的另一头，他说一切都结束了。孩子依然张着嘴，却默不作声，他躺在乱糟糟的毯子中间，小小的身子缩成一团，脸颊上还留着湿漉漉的泪痕。","But then, suddenly, the other sufferers fell silent.And now the doctor grew aware that the child’s wail, after weakening more and more, had fluttered out into silence.Around him the groans began again, but more faintly, like a far echo of the fight that now was over.For it was over.Castel had moved round to the other side of the bed and said the end had come.His mouth still gaping, but silent now, the child was lying among the tumbled blankets, a small, shrunken form, with the tears still wet on his cheeks."
"帕纳卢走到孩子的病床边，做了个祝福的手势。接着他拿起他的长袍，沿着病床间的过道走了出去。","Paneloux went up to the bed and made the sign of benediction.Then gathering up his cassock, he walked out by the passage between the beds."
"“你又得一切从头来过吗？”塔鲁问卡斯特尔。","“Will you have to start it all over again?”Tarrou asked Castel."
"老医生勉强微笑着慢慢地点了点头。","The old doctor nodded slowly, with a twisted smile."
"“也许吧。不管怎样，孩子还是坚持了很长一段时间。”","“Perhaps.After all, he put up a surprisingly long resistance.”"
"里厄已经在往病房外走了，他走得那么快，表情那么奇怪，于是，当他走到门口正要从帕纳卢身边走过去时，神父伸手拉住了他。","Rieux was already on his way out, walking so quickly and with such a strange look on his face that Paneloux put out an arm to check him when he was about to pass him in the doorway."
"“等等，医生。”帕纳卢说。","“Come, doctor,” he began."
"里厄猛地转过身来对着神父。","Rieux swung round on him fiercely."
"“啊！无论如何，这孩子是无辜的，你我都清楚这一点！”","“Ah! That child, anyhow, was innocent, and you know it as well as I do!”"
"里厄把帕纳卢甩在身后，继续大步向前走，穿过了学校的操场。他坐在几棵褪了色又发育不良的树下的一条木长凳上，将正要流进眼睛里的汗水擦去。他想大骂几句——任何语言，只要能解开被钢铁捆住了的心灵的束缚。热浪透过无花果树的树枝间隙滚滚袭来。一层白色的雾气很快遮住了早晨那蔚蓝的天空，空气也变得更加闷热了。里厄疲惫不堪地靠坐在长凳上。他抬头凝视着参差不齐的树枝和微微发亮的天空，呼吸慢慢地顺畅起来，疲劳也渐渐地消失了。","He strode on, brushing past Paneloux, and walked across the school playground.Sitting on a wooden bench under the dingy, stunted trees, he wiped off the sweat that was beginning to run into his eyes.He felt like shouting imprecations—anything to loosen the stranglehold lashing his heart with steel.Heat was flooding down between the branches of the fig trees.A white haze, spreading rapidly over the blue of the morning sky, made the air yet more stifling.Rieux lay back wearily on the bench.Gazing up at the ragged branches, the shimmering sky, he slowly got back his breath and fought down his fatigue."
"他听到身后有人说：“刚才你说话时为什么发火？我们所看到的情景，你受不了，我也受不了。”","He heard a voice behind him.“Why was there that anger in your voice just now?What we’d been seeing was as unbearable to me as it was to you.”"
"里厄扭过头去看着帕纳卢。","Rieux turned toward Paneloux."
"“我知道。对不起。但疲劳就是一种疯狂。有时候，我唯一的感觉就是觉得自己要发疯了。”","“I know.I’m sorry.But weariness is a kind of madness.And there are times when the only feeling I have is one of mad revolt.”"
"“我很理解，”帕纳卢低声说，“这事真是令人厌恶，因为它超出了我们人类所能理解的极限。但也许我们应该去爱那些我们不能理解的东西。”","“I understand,” Paneloux said in a low voice.“That sort of thing is revolting because it passes our human understanding.But perhaps we should love what we cannot understand.”"
"里厄缓缓地站起身来。他盯着帕纳卢，这目光中凝聚了所有的力量和热情来抵御他的疲倦。接着，他又摇了摇头。","Rieux straightened up slowly.He gazed at Paneloux, summoning to his gaze all the strength and fervor he could muster against his weariness.Then he shook his head."
"“不，神父。我对爱有另一种完全不同的理解。到死我也不会去爱令孩子们深受折磨的这一切。”","“No, Father.I’ve a very different idea of love.And until my dying day I shall refuse to love a scheme of things in which children are put to torture.”"
"神父的脸上掠过一丝忧虑。“啊，医生，”他悲伤地说，“我只知道什么叫‘上帝的恩典’。”","A shade of disquietude crossed the priest’s face.“Ah, doctor,” he said sadly, “I’ve just realized what is meant by ‘grace.’” "
"里厄筋疲力尽地坐回到长凳上。疲劳的感觉又回来了，但在极度的疲倦中，他更为温和地对神父说：","Rieux had sunk back again on the bench.His lassitude had returned and from its depths he spoke, more gently: "
"“我对此不能理解，这我清楚。但我不想与你谈论这事。我们正在为共同的事业而并肩工作着——这超越了渎神和敬神的界限。而这才是唯一重要的事。”","“It’s something I haven’t got; that I know.But I’d rather not discuss that with you.We’re working side by side for something that unites us—beyond blasphemy and prayers.And it’s the only thing that matters.”"
"帕纳卢在里厄身边坐了下来。他显然深受感动。","Paneloux sat down beside Rieux.It was obvious that he was deeply moved."
"“对，对，”他说，“你也是在为了拯救人类而工作着。”","“Yes, yes,” he said, “you, too, are working for man’s salvation.”"
"里厄试着微微一笑。","Rieux tried to smile."
"“‘拯救’这个词对我来说太大了。我的目标没这么高。我关心的是人的健康，对我而言，人的健康是最重要的。”","“Salvation’s much too big a word for me.I don’t aim so high.I’m concerned with man’s health; and for me his health comes first.”"
"帕纳卢似乎犹豫了片刻。“医生——”他刚一开口就不再往下说了。汗水也顺着他的脸颊流了下来。","Paneloux seemed to hesitate.“Doctor—” he began, then fell silent.Down his face, too, sweat was trickling."
"他喃喃着说了声“再见”就站了起来。他的眼眶湿润了。他转身要走时，若有所思的里厄突然站了起来，朝他走近了一步。","Murmuring: “Good-by for the present,” he rose.His eyes were moist.When he turned to go, Rieux, who had seemed lost in thought, suddenly rose and took a step toward him."
"“再次请你原谅。我发誓以后不再这样发火了。“","“Again, please forgive me.I can promise there won’t be another outburst of that kind.”"
"帕纳卢伸出他的手，遗憾地说：","Paneloux held out his hand, saying regretfully: "
"“不过——我没有说服你！”","“And yet—I haven’t convinced you!”"
"“这有什么关系？你知道，我所憎恨的是死亡和疾病。不管你愿不愿意，我们都在一起面对它们并与之斗争着。”里厄依然握着帕纳卢的手。但他并没有正视神父，只是说：“你看，现在连天主也不能将我们分开了。”","“What does it matter?What I hate is death and disease, as you well know.And whether you wish it or not, we’re allies, facing them and fighting them together.”Rieux was still holding Paneloux’s hand.“So you see”—but he refrained from meeting the priest’s eyes—”God Himself can’t part us now.”"
"第二十一章","Chapter 21"
"自从帕纳卢与里厄并肩工作以来，他整天都呆在医院里或是到疫区去。他选择与同事们一起投入到他自认为是义不容辞的工作——第一线的抢救工作中去。从那时起，他时常与死神擦肩而过。尽管从理论上说，接种了疫苗就有了免疫力，但他很清楚，死神随时都可能夺去他的生命，而且他也想过这一切。表面看来他一直都很镇静。但从他亲眼看到一个孩子死去的那天起，他似乎有了些变化。他的脸上呈现出思想日益紧张的迹象。有一天，他微笑着对里厄说，他正在写一篇小论文，题目为《一个神父可以请医生看病吗？》。里厄认为神父想要阐述的东西比他表面上提出的这个问题要更严肃。当医生说他很想拜读一下这篇文章时，帕纳卢告诉里厄，不久后他将在男教徒弥撒仪式上作一次布道，那时他至少可以阐述自己对于这个问题的一些看法。","Since joining Rieux’s band of workers Paneloux had spent his entire time in hospitals and places where he came in contact with plague.He had elected for the place among his fellow workers that he judged incumbent on him—in the forefront of the fight.And constantly since then he had rubbed shoulders with death.Though theoretically immunized by periodical inoculations, he was well aware that at any moment death might claim him too, and he had given thought to this.Outwardly he had lost nothing of his serenity.But from the day on which he saw a child die, something seemed to change in him.And his face bore traces of the rising tension of his thoughts.When one day he told Rieux with a smile that he was working on a short essay entitled “Is a Priest Justified in Consulting a Doctor?”Rieux had gathered that something graver lay behind the question than the priest’s tone seemed to imply.On the doctor’s saying he would greatly like to have a look at the essay, Paneloux informed him that he would shortly be preaching at a Mass for men, and his sermon would convey some at least of his considered opinions on the question."
"“医生，我希望你也能来。你会对这个话题感兴趣的。”","“I hope you’ll come, doctor.The subject will interest you.”"
"帕纳卢神父作第二次布道的那天，狂风肆虐。说实话，这次的会众比第一次布道时要少，在一定程度上是因为这种活动对这里的市民来说已经没有什么新奇感了。的确，鉴于他们所面对的异乎寻常的状况，“新奇”这个词已经没有任何意义了。此外，大多数人认为他们并没有完全放弃宗教礼仪，或者说，他们并没有一边参加宗教仪式，一边过着极不道德的生活，他们不过是用一些多少有些过分的迷信活动代替了平时的宗教活动。因此，他们宁愿佩带用以预防疾病的圣洛克的护身符，也不去参加弥撒。","A high wind was blowing on the day Father Paneloux preached his second sermon.The congregation, it must be admitted, was sparser than on the first occasion, partly because this kind of performance had lost its novelty for our townsfolk.Indeed, considering the abnormal conditions they were up against, the very word “novelty” had lost all meaning.Moreover, most people, assuming they had not altogether abandoned religious observances, or did not combine them naively with a thoroughly immoral way of living, had replaced normal religious practice by more or less extravagant superstitions.Thus they were readier to wear prophylactic medals of St. Roch than to go to Mass."
"市民们对各种预言都抱有浓厚的兴趣就是个例子。是的，春天时，人们指望疫病会随时戛然而止，没人想过向别人打听它可能会拖到什么时候，因为大家都深信它不会拖延下去。但随着日子一天天过去，人们开始害怕这场灾难可能会无限期地拖延下去，这时鼠疫结束就成了众人的希望。因此，占卜者或天主教会圣人们所作的预言的手抄本在人们手中畅通无阻地被传阅着。当地的出版社很快就意识到，迎合这种新出现的狂热心理可以牟利，于是就把那些正在流行的预言手抄本大量印刷出版。当他们发现这类印刷品还不能满足公众的需求时，他们就派人到市图书馆去寻找各类精神食粮，查阅一些老旧的编年史、纪事录之类的书籍。当图书馆的资源也变得枯竭之后，他们就请些记者来杜撰预言，而事实证明这些记者至少在这方面可以与历代的同行媲美。","An illustration may be found in the remarkable interest shown in prophecies of all descriptions.True, in the spring, when the epidemic was expected to end abruptly at any moment, no one troubled to take another’s opinion as to its probable duration, since everyone had persuaded himself that it would have none.But as the days went by, a fear grew up that the calamity might last indefinitely, and then the ending of the plague became the target of all hopes.As a result copies of predictions attributed to soothsayers or saints of the Catholic Church circulated freely from hand to hand.The local printing firms were quick to realize the profit to be made by pandering to this new craze and printed large numbers of the prophecies that had been going round in manuscript.Finding that the public appetite for this type of literature was still unsated, they had researches made in the municipal libraries for all the mental pabulum of the kind available in old chronicles, memoirs, and the like.And when this source ran dry, they commissioned journalists to write up forecasts, and, in this respect at least, the journalists proved themselves equal to their prototypes of earlier ages."
"一些预言类文章竟然在报纸上连载刊出，取代了疫病爆发前这些栏目所刊载的那些言情小说，但人们的阅读热情却丝毫未减。有些预测是根据一些牵强的算术计算而作出的，包括鼠疫发生的年份、鼠疫造成的死亡总数、鼠疫持续的月数等。另一些预测通过对比分析以前发生过的大鼠疫，总结出它们的相似之处（预言家们称之为“常数”），并据此推断出这次鼠疫灾难的结局。但最受市民欢迎的预言家无疑是这些人：他们用《启示录》式的语言来揭示将要发生的一系列事件，而其中的任一事件似乎都可能在现实中应验，并且事件都很深奥，可以有各种解释。因此，人们每天都去查阅诺斯特拉达穆斯和圣女奥迪尔的书籍，并且总能找到满意的答案。事实上，这些预言的一个共同点就是，它们最终都会让人安心。可不幸的是，鼠疫是不会让人安心的。","Some of these prophetic writings were actually serialized in our newspapers and read with as much avidity as the love-stories that had occupied these columns in the piping times of health.Some predictions were based on far-fetched arithmetical calculations, involving the figures of the year, the total of deaths, and the number of months the plague had so far lasted.Others made comparisons with the great pestilences of former times, drew parallels (which the forecasters called “constants”), and claimed to deduce conclusions bearing on the present calamity.But our most popular prophets were undoubtedly those who in an apocalyptic jargon had announced sequences of events, any one of which might be construed as applicable to the present state of affairs and was abstruse enough to admit of almost any interpretation.Thus Nostradamus and St. Odilia were consulted daily, and always with happy results.Indeed, the one thing these prophecies had in common was that, ultimately, all were reassuring.Unfortunately, though, the plague was not."
"在市民们的生活中，迷信已经取代了宗教的位置，所以当帕纳卢在教堂讲道时，所有的座位只坐满了四分之三。那天晚上，里厄到达教堂时，一股股大风正通过双开式弹簧门灌进来，过道上充斥着股股突如其来的气流。就在这寒冷、寂静的教堂里，里厄坐在清一色的男性会众中间，看着神父登上了讲道台。神父这次讲道时语调比上次更为温和、更为深思熟虑，而且教徒们发现他说话的过程中出现了好几次停顿。还有一个更值得注意的变化是，他现在说话时称“我们”而不是“你们”了。","Thus superstition had usurped the place of religion in the life of our town, and that is why the church in which Paneloux preached his sermon was only three-quarters full.That evening, when Rieux arrived, the wind was pouring in great gusts through the swing-doors and filling the aisles with sudden drafts.And it was in a cold, silent church, surrounded by a congregation of men exclusively, that Rieux watched the Father climb into the pulpit.He spoke in a gentler, more thoughtful tone than on the previous occasion, and several times was noticed to be stumbling over his words.A yet more noteworthy change was that instead of saying “you” he now said “we.”"
"但是，他的声音逐渐变得坚定起来。他开始提醒大家说，好几个月来，鼠疫一直存在于我们中间，我们经常看到它坐在我们的桌旁或我们亲人的床边，所以我们现在更了解它了。我们看到它在我们身边走动，也看到它在我们工作的地方等候我们上班。因此，我们现在也许可以更好地理解它不断对我们说的话；在鼠疫发生之初，我们因为感到震惊而可能没有认真地倾听这些话。他，帕纳卢神父，在第一次布道时所说的话依然正确——至少他自己对此深信不疑。但是，因为鼠疫可能会降临到我们当中的任何一个人身上（这时他捶了捶他的胸脯），他当时的说法和想法都缺乏慈悲之心。但是，有一点是不可否认的，在任何情况下，我们都应该记住这样一个事实。所有的考验，无论看起来有多么残酷，对基督教徒来说都是一种恩惠。而且，事实上，基督教徒在这种考验中一直追求的应该是去领悟这种恩惠是由什么构成的，以及怎样从中获取最大的利益。","However, his voice grew gradually firmer as he proceeded.He started by recalling that for many a long month plague had been in our midst, and we now knew it better, after having seen it often seated at our tables or at the bedsides of those we loved.We had seen it walking at our side, or waiting for our coming at the places where we worked.Thus we were now, perhaps, better able to comprehend what it was telling us unceasingly; a message to which, in the first shock of the visitation, we might not have listened with due heed.What he, Father Paneloux, had said in his first sermon still held good—such, anyhow, was his belief.And yet, perhaps, as may befall any one of us (here he struck his breast), his words and thoughts had lacked in charity.However this might be, one thing was not to be gainsaid; a fact that always, under all circumstances, we should bear in mind.Appearances notwithstanding, all trials, however cruel, worked together for good to the Christian.And, indeed, what a Christian should always seek in his hour of trial was to discern that good, in what it consisted and how best he could turn it to account."
"这时候，里厄周围的人们似乎都很平静地挨着教堂长椅的靠手坐着，尽量让自己感觉舒服些。教堂入口处的一扇包着衬垫的大门被风吹得吱嘎作响，有人起身去把它给关紧了。里厄因此而分了心，没有听清帕纳卢这段时间又说了些什么。神父的意思显然是这样：我们可能想要去解释鼠疫这种现象，但是，最重要的是，我们应该从鼠疫中学到它必须传授给我们的一些东西。里厄认为，在神父看来，实在没什么好解释的。","At this stage the people near Rieux seemed to settle in against the arm-rests of their pews and make themselves as comfortable as they could.One of the big padded entrance doors was softly thudding in the wind, and someone got up to secure it.As a result, Rieux’s attention wandered and he did not follow well what Paneloux now went on to say.Apparently it came to this: we might try to explain the phenomenon of the plague, but, above all, should learn what it had to teach us.Rieux gathered that, to the Father’s thinking, there was really nothing to explain."
"帕纳卢更强有力的声音提起了里厄的兴趣，神父说，有些事情我们解释为感动上苍，而另一些事情我们却无法解释。毫无疑问，世界上既有善也有恶，而且一般来说，很容易看到善恶间的区别。但我们很难深入了解恶的本质，而且他把万物中的恶也归为人类的磨难。因此，我们显然要受一些必要的苦和不必要的苦。唐璜被打入地狱，但也有孩子死去。尽管一个浪荡子丧了命是应该的，但一个孩子也要受苦就无法解释了。而且，说实话，世界上没有什么比一个孩子的痛苦、这种痛苦给我们带来的恐惧，以及我们必须找到造成这种痛苦的原因更重要的了。在生命的其他表现中，上帝给了我们生活上的一切便利，因此，在这以前，宗教没有什么价值。但现在，可以说，上帝让我们身陷囹圄。事实上，我们都成了鼠疫的阶下囚，而我们必须在它那死亡的阴影下寻求救赎。他，帕纳卢神父，不会借助一些简单的方法来越过这道囚牢的高墙。他本来可以轻而易举地使人们确信，永恒的天堂之乐将会补偿孩子的痛苦。但是，说实话，他对此一无所知，那他又怎能作此保证呢？谁敢肯定永恒的幸福可以补偿人类一时所受的痛苦呢？会这样说的人就不是真正的基督教徒，就不是我主耶稣的追随者，因为耶稣在肉体和精神上都饱受痛苦的折磨。不，他，帕纳卢神父，将会坚持他的信仰：我主钉在十字架上的身体就是所有磨难的伟大象征。他不会让步，他会背对着牢墙，而直面孩子遭受痛苦煎熬这个难题。而且，他会毫无畏惧地对今天来听他布道的这些人说：“我的兄弟们，考验我们的时刻到来了。我们要么全信，要么全不信。但我要问，你们中间谁敢全不信？”","His interest quickened when, in a more emphatic tone, the preacher said that there were some things we could grasp as touching God, and others we could not.There was no doubt as to the existence of good and evil and, as a rule, it was easy to see the difference between them.The difficulty began when we looked into the nature of evil, and among things evil he included human suffering.Thus we had apparently needful pain, and apparently needless pain; we had Don Juan cast into hell, and a child’s death.For while it is right that a libertine should be struck down, we see no reason for a child’s suffering.And, truth to tell, nothing was more important on earth than a child’s suffering, the horror it inspires in us, and the reasons we must find to account for it.In other manifestations of life God made things easy for us and, thus far, our religion had no merit.But in this respect He put us, so to speak, with our backs to the wall.Indeed, we all were up against the wall that plague had built around us, and in its lethal shadow we must work out our salvation.He, Father Paneloux, refused to have recourse to simple devices enabling him to scale that wall.Thus he might easily have assured them that the child’s sufferings would be compensated for by an eternity of bliss awaiting him.But how could he give that assurance when, to tell the truth, he knew nothing about it?For who would dare to assert that eternal happiness can compensate for a single moment’s human suffering?He who asserted that would not be a true Christian, a follower of the Master who knew all the pangs of suffering in his body and his soul.No, he, Father Paneloux, would keep faith with that great symbol of all suffering, the tortured body on the Cross; he would stand fast, his back to the wall, and face honestly the terrible problem of a child’s agony.And he would boldly say to those who listened to his words today: “My brothers, a time of testing has come for us all.We must believe everything or deny everything.And who among you, I ask, would dare to deny everything?”"
"里厄的脑海里闪过一个念头：帕纳卢神父正游走在异端邪说的边缘，但他还来不及继续往下细想。这时神父正热情激昂地对众人说，现在基督教徒被赋予的不可推卸的责任就是发挥他那至高无上的美德以及他的特权。他很清楚，有些人的头脑里都是些更为宽容、更为传统的道德观念，因此，他接下来要说的看起来有些过分的基督教徒的美德即使不会令他们感到愤怒，也可能会令他们感到诧异。但鼠疫时期的宗教不可能与平时的宗教一样。在更为幸福的平常日子里，上帝可能会同意，甚至希望人的灵魂能获得安宁与欢乐，但在大难时期，他对人的灵魂提出了极为苛刻的要求。因此，今天上帝赐予他的子民们一个严峻的考验，使他们不得不接受并践行这至高无上的美德：要么全盘接受信仰，要么全盘否定信仰。","It crossed Rieux’s mind that Father Paneloux was dallying with heresy in speaking thus, but he had no time to follow up the thought.The preacher was declaring vehemently that this uncompromising duty laid on the Christian was at once his ruling virtue and his privilege.He was well aware that certain minds, schooled to a more indulgent and conventional morality, might well be dismayed, not to say outraged, by the seemingly excessive standard of Christian virtue about which he was going to speak.But religion in a time of plague could not be the religion of every day.While God might accept and even desire that the soul should take its ease and rejoice in happier times, in periods of extreme calamity He laid extreme demands on it.Thus today God had vouchsafed to His creatures an ordeal such that they must acquire and practice the greatest of all virtues: that of the All or Nothing."
"数个世纪以前，一位异教徒作家声称自己揭开了教会的秘密，他断言根本就没有炼狱。他的言下之意是只有天堂和地狱，没有什么中间状态，人们死后要么上天堂，要么下地狱。帕纳卢说，这是一种异端邪说，只能是出自一个盲目而混乱的灵魂。但是，可能在某些历史时期，人们还是不要指望着进炼狱；在某些时期，根本不可能有什么可以宽恕的罪孽。任何罪孽都该接受下地狱的惩罚，任何漠不关心的态度都是犯罪。要么有罪，要么无罪。","Many centuries previously a profane writer had claimed to reveal a secret of the Church by declaring that purgatory did not exist.He wished to convey that there could be no half measures, there was only the alternative between heaven and hell; you were either saved or damned.That, according to Paneloux, was a heresy that could spring only from a blind, disordered soul.Nevertheless, there may well have been periods of history when purgatory could not be hoped for; periods when it was impossible to speak of venial sin.Every sin was deadly, and any indifference criminal.It was all or it was nothing."
"神父停顿了一下，而里厄则更清晰地听到了外面呼呼的风声，风从门缝里灌了进来，从这风声来判断，外面已是狂风大作了。接着，里厄又听到了帕纳卢神父的说话声。神父说，他所说的全盘接受的美德按照常理是很难被人理解的，他所说的不只是顺从，甚至也不是那种更难达到的美德——谦卑。这牵扯着羞辱，但蒙羞者对此心甘情愿。的确，一个孩子所遭受的这种痛苦令他的身心蒙羞。但正因为如此，我们必须完全接受这种痛苦。也正因为如此——这时帕纳卢要在座的听众们确信，他要说的话并非是轻易说出来的——我们应该主动去要这种痛苦，因为这也是上帝的意愿。只有这样，基督教徒才能正视问题，不屑任何托词，直接切入正题，作出重大的抉择。他会选择全盘接受信仰，只是为了不让自己落到全盘否定信仰的地步。就像那些可敬的妇人们一样，她们在得知腹股沟淋巴腺是自然人体组织，是人体往外排毒通道之后，就到教堂里去祷告：“主啊，请赐予他腹股沟腺炎吧！”因此，基督教徒也应该完全服从神意，即使他不能理解这种神意。我们不该说：“这个，我能理解，但那个，我不能接受”；我们应该正视那不能接受的事物，正是因为这个原因，我们被迫作出自己的选择。孩子们的痛苦是我们不幸的面包，但是，若没有这块面包，我们的灵魂就会因为精神食粮匮乏而枯萎。","The preacher paused, and Rieux heard more clearly the whistling of the wind outside; judging by the sounds that came in below the closed doors, it had risen to storm pitch.Then he heard Father Paneloux’s voice again.He was saying that the total acceptance of which he had been speaking was not to be taken in the limited sense usually given to the words; he was not thinking of mere resignation or even of that harder virtue, humility.It involved humiliation, but a humiliation to which the person humiliated gave full assent.True, the agony of a child was humiliating to the heart and to the mind.But that was why we had to come to terms with it.And that, too, was why—and here Paneloux assured those present that it was not easy to say what he was about to say—since it was God’s will, we, too, should will it.Thus and thus only the Christian could face the problem squarely and, scorning subterfuge, pierce to the heart of the supreme issue, the essential choice.And his choice would be to believe everything, so as not to be forced into denying everything.Like those worthy women who, after learning that buboes were the natural issues through which the body cast out infection, went to their church and prayed: “Please, God, give him buboes,” thus the Christian should yield himself wholly to the divine will, even though it passed his understanding.It was wrong to say: “This I understand, but that I cannot accept”; we must go straight to the heart of that which is unacceptable, precisely because it is thus that we are constrained to make our choice.The sufferings of children were our bread of affliction, but without this bread our souls would die of spiritual hunger."
"每当神父停顿一下，下面就会响起一阵嘈杂声，而现在，嘈杂声刚一起来，神父就出人意料地提高了嗓门，仿佛是从听众的角度提了个问题：接下来该怎么办呢？他不怀疑人们会把他所说的话和“宿命论”这个可怕的词联系起来。唉，只要人们允许他在“宿命论”前加上“积极的”这个形容词，他是不会畏惧“宿命论”这个词的。不用说，人们无疑不应去模仿他上次提到的那些阿比西尼亚基督教徒们。人们甚至也不该想着去学那些波斯人：在鼠疫期间他们把自己带病菌的衣服扔到那些充当卫生队员的基督教徒们身上，并且大声乞求苍天把鼠疫降临到这些离经叛道者身上，因为这些队员们正在尽力避开上帝所赐的灾难。但是，反过来，人们也不该去模仿那些开罗的修道士们，他们在鼠疫肆虐全城时期做弥撒时用镊子来夹圣体饼，只为了避免因接触信徒们又潮又热的嘴，因为那里可能潜伏着感染病毒。这些处于瘟疫中的波斯人和修道士们同样都是错误的。前者不在乎一个孩子所遭受的痛苦；而后者，正相反，却把人对痛苦的那种与生俱来的害怕凌驾于一切之上。二者都回避了真正的问题，他们都没有听到天主的声音。","The shuffling sounds which usually followed the moment when the preacher paused were beginning to make themselves heard when, unexpectedly, he raised his voice, making as if to put himself in his hearers’ place and ask what then was the proper course to follow.He made no doubt that the ugly word “fatalism” would be applied to what he said.Well, he would not boggle at the word, provided he were allowed to qualify it with the adjective “active.”Needless to say, there was no question of imitating the Abyssinian Christians of whom he had spoken previously.Nor should one even think of acting like those Persians who in time of plague threw their infected garments on the Christian sanitary workers and loudly called on Heaven to give the plague to these infidels who were trying to avert a pestilence sent by God.But, on the other hand, it would be no less wrong to imitate the monks at Cairo who, when plague was raging in the town, distributed the Host with pincers at the Mass, so as to avoid contact with wet, warm mouths in which infection might be latent.The plague-stricken Persians and the monks were equally at fault.For the former a child’s agony did not count; with the latter, on the contrary, the natural dread of suffering ranked highest in their conduct.In both cases the real problem had been shirked; they had closed their ears to God’s voice."
"帕纳卢接着说，他现在还想提醒大家一些以前的事例。根据有关马赛大鼠疫的编年史记载，在施恩修道院中的八十一个修道士中，只有四人在鼠疫中幸存。而四人中有三人是逃走的。至此，记录者只记下了这些，除了赤裸裸的事实，他也没有义务再告诉我们更多。但当帕纳卢神父阅读这篇编年史时，他关注的是那位主动选择留下来的修道士，尽管那时已有七十七位同伴死去了，尤其是，尽管他那三位教友已经逃走在先了。于是，帕纳卢神父一边用拳头敲着讲道台的边缘，一边用嘹亮的声音喊道：","But, Paneloux continued, there were other precedents of which he would now remind them.If the chronicles of the Black Death at Marseille were to be trusted, only four of the eighty-one monks in the Mercy Monastery survived the epidemic.And of these four three took to flight.Thus far the chronicler, and it was not his task to tell us more than the bare facts.But when he read that chronicle, Father Paneloux had found his thoughts fixed on that monk who stayed on by himself, despite the death of his seventy-seven companions, and, above all, despite the example of his three brothers who had fled.And, bringing down his fist on the edge of the pulpit, Father Paneloux cried in a ringing voice:"
"“我的兄弟们，我们每个人都该向这位留下来的修道士学习！”在瘟疫的混乱状况下，我们不可能不采取一些预防措施，或者不遵守那些为了公共利益而颁布的合理的命令。我们也不该听那些伦理学家的话，说是要卑躬屈膝，放弃斗争。不，我们应该在黑暗中摸索着前进，也许有时会磕磕绊绊，也要尽力去做些力所能及的事情。至于其他事情，即使涉及孩子们的死亡问题，我们也必须任其自然，相信天主的仁慈，而不要去寻求个人的解决办法。","“My brothers, each one of us must be the one who stays!”There was no question of not taking precautions or failing to comply with the orders wisely promulgated for the public weal in the disorders of a pestilence.Nor should we listen to certain moralists who told us to sink on our knees and give up the struggle.No, we should go forward, groping our way through the darkness, stumbling perhaps at times, and try to do what good lay in our power.As for the rest, we must hold fast, trusting in the divine goodness, even as to the deaths of little children, and not seeking personal respite."
"讲到这里，帕纳卢神父追忆了马赛鼠疫中贝尔增斯主教威严的形象。他让他的听众们回想起鼠疫将要结束时，这位主教在做了他该做的一切努力之后，把自己关在了寝宫里，储备一些食物和饮用水之后便躲在高墙之后。就像人们在极度痛苦时期感情会发生突变一样，在这以前一直把他视为偶像的马赛居民们突然对他反感起来，他们把尸体堆放在他的屋子周围，想让他染上鼠疫，甚至还把尸体从墙头扔进去，要让他必死无疑。因此，这位主教一时软弱，本以为自己可以与世隔绝——然而，看吧，死尸还是像雨点般落在了他的头上！我们应该从中得到教训，我们必须确信鼠疫的汪洋大海中没有任何用以避难的岛屿。不，绝对没有中间的安全地带。我们必须接受这个困境并作出抉择：恨天主，或是爱天主。但谁敢作出恨天主的选择呢？","At this point Father Paneloux evoked the august figure of Bishop Belzunce during the Marseille plague.He reminded his hearers how, toward the close of the epidemic, the Bishop, having done all that it behooved him, shut himself up in his palace, behind high walls, after laying in a stock of food and drink.With a sudden revulsion of feeling, such as often comes in times of extreme tribulation, the inhabitants of Marseille, who had idolized him hitherto, now turned against him, piled up corpses round his house in order to infect it, and even flung bodies over the walls to make sure of his death.Thus in a moment of weakness the Bishop had proposed to isolate himself from the outside world—and, lo and behold, corpses rained down on his head!This had a lesson for us all; we must convince ourselves that there is no island of escape in time of plague.No, there was no middle course.We must accept the dilemma and choose either to hate God or to love God.And who would dare to choose to hate Him?"
"“我的兄弟们，”神父的语气表明他快要接近这次布道的尾声了，“对天主的爱是一种艰难的爱。这种爱需要完全放弃自我，鄙弃我们作为人类的个性。但只有这种爱才能使我们甘于接受痛苦和孩子们的死亡，也只有这种爱才能解释这一切，因为我们不能理解这一切，我们唯一能做的便是一切遂天意。这就是今天我要与诸位一起分享的深刻教训。这就是信仰，在人类眼里很残忍，在上帝眼中很重要，我们必须一直努力去领会。我们必须超越自我，达到那种骇人的崇高境界。一旦达到这种高度，一切就都明白了，一切异议就都平息了，而真理也会从看似不公平的乌云中绽放出光芒来。因此，在法国南部的一些教堂里，死于鼠疫的人们在祭坛的石板下面安睡了几个世纪，如今教士们就在死者的坟墓上布道，而他们所宣扬的神圣的思想正是这堆包括孩子们在内的尸骨所要传达的信息。”里厄正要离开教堂时，一阵狂风从半开着的大门中间灌进了教堂中殿，吹到了正起身离开的会众的脸上。风带来一股雨水的气息，一股湿透的人行道的味道，提醒着人们出了教堂将会遇上什么天气。走在里厄前面的一位老教士和一位年轻的执事正费力地按住他们的帽子以不被风刮走。但其中年长的那位仍在不停地谈论着刚听到的这次布道。他对神父的口才表示敬意，但神父所表达的这种大胆的思想又让他踌躇。在他看来，这次布道没有显示其真正的力量，而更多的是种不安的情绪，但帕纳卢神父到了这把年纪是不该感到不安的。低着脑袋挡风的年轻执事回答说，他与这位神父打过多次交道，很了解神父的思想演变，也相信神父写的小册子还会更大胆些。事实上，他的小册子很可能不会获准出版。","“My brothers”—the preacher’s tone showed he was nearing the conclusion of his sermon—“the love of God is a hard love.It demands total self-surrender, disdain of our human personality.And yet it alone can reconcile us to suffering and the deaths of children, it alone can justify them, since we cannot understand them, and we can only make God’s will ours.That is the hard lesson I would share with you today.That is the faith, cruel in men’s eyes, and crucial in God’s, which we must ever strive to compass.We must aspire beyond ourselves toward that high and fearful vision.And on that lofty plane all will fall into place, all discords be resolved, and truth flash forth from the dark cloud of seeming injustice.Thus in some churches of the south of France plague victims have lain sleeping many a century under the flagstones of the chancel, and priests now speak above their tombs, and the divine message they bring to men rises from that charnel, to which, nevertheless, children have contributed their share.”When Rieux was preparing to leave the church a violent gust swept up the nave through the half-open doors and buffeted the faces of the departing congregation.It brought with it a smell of rain, a tang of drenched sidewalks, warning them of the weather they would encounter outside.An old priest and a young deacon who were walking immediately in front of Rieux had much difficulty in keeping their headdress from blowing away.But this did not prevent the elder of the two from discussing the sermon they had heard.He paid tribute to the preacher’s eloquence, but the boldness of thought Paneloux had shown gave him pause.In his opinion the sermon had displayed more uneasiness than real power, and at Paneloux’s age a priest had no business to feel uneasy.The young deacon, his head bowed to protect his face from the wind, replied that he saw much of the Father, had followed the evolution of his views, and believed his forthcoming pamphlet would be bolder still; indeed it might well be refused the imprimatur."
"“这并不是你的真实想法！你是什么意思呢？”老教士问道。","“You don’t mean to say so!What’s the main idea?” asked the old priest."
"他们这时已走到教堂前的广场上，大风呼啸，使得这位年轻的执事有段时间根本无法开口说话。大风减弱了些，他才对他的同伴简略地说：","They were now in the Cathedral square and for some moments the roar of the wind made it impossible for the younger man to speak.When there was a slight lull, he said briefly to his companion: "
"“我的意思是，神父请医生看病是不合逻辑的。”","“That it’s illogical for a priest to call in a doctor.”"
"里厄对塔鲁说起帕纳卢在布道时所说的一番话，塔鲁听完之后说，他认识一位神父，这位神父因为在战争中看见了一位被人挖去双眼的年轻人而不再信教了。","Tarrou, when told by Rieux what Paneloux had said, remarked that he’d known a priest who had lost his faith during the war, as the result of seeing a young man’s face with both eyes destroyed."
"“帕纳卢是对的，”塔鲁接着说，“当一个基督教徒看到一个无辜的年轻人让人挖去了双眼，他要么不再信教，要么同意让人挖去自己的眼睛。帕纳卢不愿失去信仰，并且他要坚持到底。这就是他在布道时想要表达的思想。”","“Paneloux is right,” Tarrou continued.“When an innocent youth can have his eyes destroyed, a Christian should either lose his faith or consent to having his eyes destroyed.Paneloux declines to lose his faith, and he will go through with it to the end.That’s what he meant to say.”"
"也许正是塔鲁的这番话可以用来解释帕纳卢神父在后来发生的不幸事件中所作出的令他朋友费解的行为吧。读者会作出自己的判断。","It may be that this remark of Tarrou’s throws some light on the regrettable events which followed, in the course of which the priest’s conduct seemed inexplicable to his friends.The reader will judge for himself."
"布道之后又过了几天，帕纳卢不得不搬出了自己的家。因为鼠疫疫情又有了新的发展，这时候有很多人都被迫搬离原来的家。塔鲁曾因为所住的旅馆被征用而搬到里厄家去住，而神父现在也不得不搬出他所属的修会提供给他的寓所，住进了一个尚未患上鼠疫的老妇人家，她是位虔诚的女教徒。在搬家的过程中，帕纳卢就感到越来越身心疲惫了。也正是出于这个原因，他失去了房东太太对他的尊敬。有一天晚上，当这位老太太热情地向他吹嘘着圣女奥迪尔预言的作用时，神父可能是因为疲劳而显得有些不耐烦。后来他也做了很多努力，想要转变这位善良的老太太对他的偏见，哪怕是让她的态度变得稍微友善一些，但一切努力都以失败告终。他给她留下了坏印象，并令她对此难以释怀。于是每天晚上，在他回到他那间几乎所有家具都被钩针编织物覆盖的卧室之前，他不得不注视着坐在客厅里的房东太太的后背，他得到的只是她头也不回地冷冷的一句“晚安，神父”。就在这样的一个晚上，他回卧室时突然觉得，就像洪水冲破了堤坝一般，他手腕中的血流汹涌奔腾，太阳穴也在发热，这已经在他的血液中潜伏多日了。","A few days after the sermon Paneloux had to move out of his rooms.It was a time when many people were obliged to change their residence owing to the new conditions created by the plague.Thus Tarrou, when his hotel was requisitioned, had gone to live with Rieux, and now the Father had to vacate the lodgings provided for him by his Order and stay in the house of a pious old lady who had so far escaped the epidemic.During the process of moving, Paneloux had been feeling more run down than ever, mentally as well as physically.And it was this that put him in the bad books of his hostess.One evening when she was enthusiastically vaunting the merits of St. Odilia’s prophecies, the priest betrayed a slight impatience, due probably to fatigue.All his subsequent efforts to bring the good lady round to, anyhow, a state of benevolent neutrality came to nothing.He had made a bad impression and it went on rankling.So each night on his way to his bedroom, where almost all the furniture was dotted with crochet covers, he had to contemplate the back of his hostess seated in her drawing-room and carry away with him a memory of the sour “Good night, Father,” she flung at him over her shoulder.It was on one such evening that he felt, like a flood bursting the dikes, the turbulent onrush in his wrists and temples of the fever latent in his blood for several days past."
"之后发生的事，大家只有通过这位老太太之口才知晓。第二天早晨，像平常一样，她很早就起来了。大约过了一个小时，她因为还没有看到神父从他的房间里走出来而感到奇怪，犹豫了好一会儿，她才前去敲他的门。她发现他一夜未眠，还躺在床上。他呼吸困难，脸上看起来比平时更红。她很有礼貌地提议（她自己是这样说的）叫人去请医生过来，但她的建议遭到了粗暴的拒绝，用她的话来说，这简直是“太无礼”了。所以她只好离开他的房间。之后，上午的时候，神父按铃，请她过去见他。他为自己的无礼向她道歉，并要她确信，他得的病不可能是鼠疫，因为他的身上没有任何鼠疫的症状，这只不过是一时的身体不适罢了。老太太很有尊严地回答说，她之所以提出这样的建议，并非出于此类考虑——她没有考虑自身的安全，她的安全是掌握在天主手里的——而是因为神父住在她家里，她就应该对他的健康负些责任。据她说，当时他没有说什么，而她为了尽自己的义务，又提议叫人去请医生过来。帕纳卢神父叫她不用费神，接着还做了些解释，这些解释在老太太看来即使说不上荒谬，至少也是语无伦次的。她唯一能听懂的是，神父之所以拒绝看医生，是因为这违背了他的原则，但又正是这一点在她看来是无法理解的。她觉得她那位房客因为发烧而昏了头，而她所能做的也只是给他端了一杯茶水而已。","The only available account of what followed comes from the lips of the old lady.Next morning she rose early, as was her wont.After an hour or so, puzzled at not seeing the Father leave his room, she brought herself, not without some hesitation, to knock at his door.She found him still in bed after a sleepless night.He had difficulty in breathing and looked more flushed than usual.She had suggested most politely (as she put it) that a doctor should be called in, but her suggestion had been brushed aside with a curtness that she described as “quite unmannerly.”So she had no alternative but to leave the room.Later in the morning the Father rang and asked if he could see her.He apologized for his lack of courtesy and assured her that what he was suffering from could not be plague, as he had none of the symptoms; it was no more than a passing indisposition.The lady replied with dignity that her suggestion had not been prompted by any apprehension of that sort—she took no thought for her personal security, which was in God’s hands—but that she felt a certain measure of responsibility for the Father’s welfare while he was under her roof.When he said nothing, his hostess, wishing (according to her account) to do her duty by him, offered to send for her doctor.Father Paneloux told her not to trouble, adding some explanations that seemed to the old lady incoherent, not to say nonsensical.The only thing she gathered, and it was precisely this that appeared to her so incomprehensible, was that the Father refused to hear of a doctor’s visit because it was against his principles.Her impression was that her guest’s mind had been unhinged by fever, and she confined herself to bringing him a cup of tea."
"她下定决心要承担起她在这种情况下应尽的责任，每隔两小时就定时去看望病人一次。令她最吃惊的是神父焦躁不安的情绪，一整天都是如此。他一会儿把毯子掀开，一会儿又把它们拉回到身上，他还不断地用手摸摸他那大汗淋漓的额头。他时而不时地坐起身来，重重地咳一咳，想要清一清嗓子，但那咳嗽的声音就像是作呕一般。每到这时候，他就好像是努力想要从他的肺里挖出某种令他窒息的半固体状的东西却又不能如愿以偿似的。每一次发作过后，他都会疲惫不堪地一头倒在枕头上。接着，他又会坐起身来，目不转睛地盯着正前方，这个样子比之前的发作更令人感到吃惊。即使到了这个时候，老太太还是没有去请医生，她不愿因此而惹她的房客生气。归根结底，尽管这样子看起来很可怕，但这也许只是一阵高烧而已吧。","Resolutely mindful of the obligations imposed on her by the situation, she visited the invalid regularly every two hours.What struck her most about him was his restlessness, which continued throughout the day.He would throw off the blankets, then pull them back, and he kept running his hand over his forehead, which was glistening with sweat.Every now and then he sat up in bed and tried to clear his throat with a thick, grating cough, which sounded almost like retching.At these moments he seemed to be vainly struggling to force up from his lungs a clot of some semi-solid substance that was choking him.After each unavailing effort, he sank back, utterly exhausted, on the pillow.Then he would raise himself again a little and stare straight in front of him with a fixity even more dismaying than the paroxysms which had preceded it.Even now the old lady was reluctant to annoy her guest by calling in the doctor.After all, it might be no more than an attack of fever, spectacular as were its manifestations."
"然而，到了下午，她想再试着与神父谈一谈，但他只是不着边际地说了几个词而已。她又再次提议去请医生。这时帕纳卢又坐起身来，虽然说话闷声闷气的，却断然拒绝了看医生这个请求。在这种情况下，老太太觉得最好还是等到第二天早上再说，如果神父的病情不见好转，她就会拨通那个朗斯多克信息情报局每天在电台广播里重复播报十次的电话号码。她依然很清楚自己的责任，决定在夜里不时地去看看这位病人，给他必要的关照。在她把新煎好的药茶端给神父喝下后，她打算小憩一会儿。但她一睡就睡到了天亮才醒过来，于是她赶紧朝神父的房间奔去。","However, in the afternoon she made another attempt to talk to the priest, but she could get out of him no more than a few rambling phrases.She renewed her proposal to call in the doctor.Whereat Paneloux sat up and in a stifled voice emphatically declined to see a doctor.Under these circumstances it seemed best to the old lady to wait till the following morning; if the Father’s condition showed no more improvement she would ring up the number announced ten times daily on the radio by the Ransdoc Information Bureau.Still conscious of her obligations, she resolved to visit the invalid from time to time in the course of the night and give him any attention he might need.But after bringing him a decoction of herbal tea she decided to lie down for a while.Only at daybreak did she wake up, and then she hurried to the priest’s room."
"帕纳卢神父正静静地躺在床上，他的脸不像昨天那样潮红，现在已变成了一种如死一般的苍白，因为他的脸部还很饱满，所以看起来更加明显。他正凝视着悬挂在床上方的一盏吊灯四周的玻璃珠子。当老太太进屋时，他朝她转过头来。按她的古怪说法，他看起来好像经受了一整夜的严酷鞭打，已经是奄奄一息了。当她问他感觉如何时，令她大吃一惊的是，他用一种出奇冷漠的声音回答说他感觉很糟，但他不需要看医生，他只想照章办事，请人把他送到医院就行了。她被吓坏了，赶紧跑去打电话。","Father Paneloux was lying quite still; his face had lost its deep flush of the previous day and had now a deathly pallor, all the more impressive because the cheeks had kept their fullness.He was gazing up at the bead fringe of a lamp hanging above the bed.When the old lady came in he turned his head to her.As she quaintly put it, he looked as if he’d been severely thrashed all the night long, and more dead than alive.She was greatly struck by the apathy of his voice when, on her asking how he was feeling, he replied that he was in a bad way, he did not need a doctor, and all he wished was to be taken to the hospital, so as to comply with the regulations.Panic-stricken, she hurried to the telephone."
"正午时，里厄来了。听了老太太的一番陈述后，他简短地回答说，帕纳卢要求送医院是对的，但恐怕为时已晚了。神父带着同样冷漠的神情看着医生。里厄为神父作检查，却吃惊地发现，他除了肺部有肿胀现象和堵塞之外，并没有任何淋巴腺鼠疫或肺鼠疫的典型症状。但是，他的脉搏很弱，总的状况非常糟糕，因此救活的希望很小。","Rieux came at noon.After hearing what the old lady had to say he replied briefly that Paneloux was right, but it was probably too late.The Father welcomed him with the same air of complete indifference.Rieux examined him and was surprised to find none of the characteristic symptoms of bubonic or pneumonic plague, except congestion and obstruction of the lungs.But his pulse was so weak and his general state so alarming that there was little hope of saving him."
"“你身上没有鼠疫的任何典型症状，”里厄对神父说，“但我也不能确定这不是鼠疫，因此我必须把你隔离起来。”","“You have none of the specific symptoms of the disease,” Rieux told him.“But I admit one can’t be sure, and I must isolate you.”"
"神父奇怪地笑了笑，好像是表示礼貌，但没有说话。里厄出去打了电话，接着又回到屋里，看着神父。","The Father smiled queerly, as if for politeness’ sake, but said nothing.Rieux left the room to telephone, then came back and looked at the priest."
"“我会陪着你的。”他亲切地说。","“I’ll stay with you,” he said gently."
"帕纳卢显得多了一丝生气，他抬头看着医生，眼神里又有了一种热情。接着，他开口说话了，他说话时非常费劲，以至无法判断他的语气是否有些悲伤，他说：","Paneloux showed a little more animation and a sort of warmth came back to his eyes when he looked up at the doctor.Then, speaking with such difficulty that it was impossible to tell if there was sadness in his voice, he said: "
"“谢谢。但教士不可能有朋友。他们把一切都托付给天主了。”","“Thanks.But priests can have no friends.They have given their all to God.”"
"他要求把挂在床头的十字架递给他，他接过十字架，转过头去端详着它。","He asked for the crucifix that hung above the head of the bed; when given it, he turned away to gaze at it."
"在医院里，帕纳卢始终一言不发。他被动地接受着治疗，但从未放下过那个十字架。但是，他的病依然很可疑，而里厄也不能确切地对此作出诊断。事实上，几周以来，病情似乎一直都扑朔迷离。但在帕纳卢这个病例中，他后来病情的发展表明这种无法诊断的状况是无关紧要的。","At the hospital Paneloux did not utter a word.He submitted passively to the treatment given him, but never let go of the crucifix.However, his case continued doubtful, and Rieux could not feel sure how to diagnose it.For several weeks, indeed, the disease had seemed to make a point of confounding diagnoses.In the case of Paneloux, what followed was to show that this uncertainty had no consequence."
"他的体温上升了。整整一天，他咳嗽得越来越厉害了，他那脆弱的身体因此而备受折磨。到了黄昏的时候，帕纳卢神父终于把那团令他喘不过气来的东西咳了出来，它是鲜红色的。甚至在发着高烧的时候，帕纳卢的眼睛里依然带着一种空洞的平静，而到了第二天，当人们发现他半个身子倒在床外，已经死去的时候，他的眼睛里已没有任何表情了。他的病历卡上写着：“可疑病例”。","His temperature rose.Throughout the day the cough grew louder, racking the enfeebled body.At last, at nightfall, Father Paneloux brought up the clot of matter that was choking him; it was red.Even at the height of his fever Paneloux’s eyes kept their blank serenity, and when, next morning, he was found dead, his body drooping over the bedside, they betrayed nothing.Against his name the index card recorded: “Doubtful case.”"
"第二十二章","Chapter 22"
"这一年的万灵节与往年大有不同。当然，天气还是合时令的，但已经突然起了变化，大暑不再，取而代之的是秋高气爽。像往年一样，凉爽的秋风不分昼夜地刮着，大块的云朵从地平线一头奔向另一头，给屋顶罩上了阴影，而当云块一过，十一月那淡淡的金色阳光就又再次投到了屋顶上。","All Souls’ Day that year was very different from what it had been in former years.True, the weather was seasonable; there had been sudden change, and the great heat had given place to mild autumnal air.As in other years a cool wind blew all day, and big clouds raced from one horizon to the other, trailing shadows over the houses upon which fell again, when they had passed, the pale gold light of a November sky."
"第一批雨衣已经上市了。这外表光亮、涂着橡胶的雨衣的确多得令人吃惊。原因在于市民们从报纸上得知，两百年前欧洲南部发生大鼠疫时，医生们都是穿着涂上油脂的衣服来预防传染的。商店借机把一批库存的已经过时的雨衣拿出来销售，顾客则企盼着穿上这种雨衣可以抵御病菌的侵扰。","The first waterproofs made their appearance.Indeed, one was struck by the number of glossy, rubberized garments to be seen.The reason was that our newspapers had informed us that two hundred years previously, during the great pestilences of southern Europe, the doctors wore oiled clothing as a safeguard against infection.The shops had seized this opportunity of unloading their stock of out-of-fashion waterproofs, which their purchasers fondly hoped would guarantee immunity from germs."
"但我们不会忘记，与万灵节这些熟悉的景象形成对比的是，市里的公墓受到了冷落。往年这个时候，电车上会弥漫着浓浓的菊花的香味，成群结队的女人们来到这些安葬着亲人们的地方，在他们的墓前放上一些鲜花。就是在这一天，人们原本会前来缅怀好几个月来被人遗忘、被人抛弃、独自安眠于此的亲人们。但在大疫之年，人们再也不愿想起他们死去的亲人。因为，实际上，人们对他们已经想得太多了。人们已不再愿意带着些许遗憾，满怀忧思地去给他们扫墓了。他们已不再是一年一度人们为了释怀而前来缅怀的被遗忘的死者。他们打扰了人们的正常生活，因而人们宁愿忘记他们。因此，这一年的万灵节，人们都心照不宣地置之不理。正如科塔尔冷言评论的——塔鲁发现科塔尔说话越来越带讽刺味了——对这里的市民而言，每天都是万灵节。","But these familiar aspects of All Souls’ Day could not make us forget that the cemeteries were left unvisited.In previous years the rather sickly smell of chrysanthemums had filled the streetcars, while long lines of women could be seen making pilgrimage to the places where members of the family were buried, to lay flowers on the graves.This was the day when they made amends for the oblivion and dereliction in which their dead had slept for many a long month.But in the plague year people no longer wished to be reminded of their dead.Because, indeed, they were thinking all too much about them as it was.There was no more question of revisiting them with a shade of regret and much melancholy.They were no longer the forsaken to whom, one day in the year, you came to justify yourself.They were intruders whom you would rather forget.This is why the Day of the Dead this year was tacitly but willfully ignored.As Cottard dryly remarked—Tarrou noted that the habit of irony was growing on him more and more—each day was for us a Day of the Dead."
"而事实上，火葬场焚尸炉里的鼠疫之火烧得更欢了。死亡人数却真的没有上升。鼠疫似乎已很顺畅地到达了顶峰，它像一个尽职尽责的公务员，每天都按时而热心地完成自己的杀戮任务。从理论上说，而且在权威人士看来，这是个好兆头。鼠疫形势图表上曾经不断上升的曲线已经开始变得平直，这令理查德医生在内的许多人感到安心。“今天的图表不错。”理查德会搓着手这样说。在他看来，鼠疫已经达到了所谓的水势的最高位。之后它只会退潮。他把这归功于卡斯特尔医生新研制出来的血清，而这种血清也确实取得了许多意想不到的成效。老卡斯特尔医生尽管对此并不否认，但他提醒理查德，未来的疫情仍不可测。历史表明，疫情可能会出人意料地再度猖獗起来。很久以来，当局都在想着要刺激一下公众的士气，但因为疫情而一直未能如愿，现在则打算召集一个医疗人员会议，要求他们作一个有关疫情的通告。不幸的是，就在会议前夕，理查德医生也被鼠疫夺去了生命，而这时疫情正好处于“最高水位”。","And, in fact, the balefires of the pestilence were blazing ever more merrily in the crematorium.It is true that the actual number of deaths showed no increase.But it seemed that plague had settled in for good at its most virulent, and it took its daily toll of deaths with the punctual zeal of a good civil servant.Theoretically, and in the view of the authorities, this was a hopeful sign.The fact that the graph after its long rising curve had flattened out seemed to many, Dr. Richard for example, reassuring.“The graph’s good today,” he would remark, rubbing his hands.To his mind the disease had reached what he called high-water mark.Thereafter it could but ebb.He gave the credit of this to Dr. Castel’s new serum, which, indeed, had brought off some quite unlooked-for recoveries.While not dissenting, the old doctor reminded him that the future remained uncertain; history proved that epidemics have a way of recrudescing when least expected.The authorities, who had long been desirous of giving a fillip to the morale of the populace, but had so far been prevented by the plague from doing so, now proposed to convene a meeting of the medical corps and ask for an announcement on the subject.Unfortunately, just before the meeting was due to take place, Dr. Richard, too, was carried off by the plague, then precisely at “high-water mark.”"
"这个令人遗憾的事件尽管有些耸人听闻，但毕竟不能说明任何问题，其结果却使当局重新陷入悲观之中，正如先前他们突然不合逻辑地变得乐观起来一样。至于卡斯特尔，他还是全身心地致力于血清的研制工作。到这时，所有的公共场所都被改为医院或隔离营，只有省府除外，因为城里仍然需要一个管理和开会的场所。但是，总的说来，由于这一时期疫情相对稳定，里厄负责的医疗组织还能应付局面。医生和助手们尽管常常面临巨大的工作压力，但还不必担忧要作出更大的努力。他们所要做的只是按部就班地工作，不过这也可以说得上是超人的工作了。已经发现的肺部受鼠疫感染的病例现在正在全城蔓延开去，人们不禁想到正是大风煽动着鼠疫的烈焰在人们的肺里熊熊燃烧。许多肺部鼠疫患者在吐出大量的血痰之后，更快地被夺去了性命。这种新型鼠疫似乎更具感染性，也更为致命。不过，专家们一直对此意见不一。为了安全起见，所有卫生防疫人员都戴上了消毒纱布口罩。表面上看，这种鼠疫应该已经在肆虐蔓延了。但是，因为淋巴腺鼠疫的病例正在减少，所以死亡率仍然保持不变。","The effect of this regrettable event, which, sensational as it was, actually proved nothing, was to make our authorities swing back to pessimism as inconsequently as they had previously indulged in optimism.As for Castel, he confined himself to preparing his serums with the maximum of care.By this time no public place or building had escaped conversion into a hospital or quarantine camp with the exception of the Prefect’s offices, which were needed for administrative purposes and committee meetings.In a general way, however, owing to the relative stability of the epidemic at this time, Rieux’s organizations were still able to cope with the situation.Though working constantly at high pressure, the doctors and their helpers were not forced to contemplate still greater efforts.All they had to do was to carry on automatically, so to speak, their all but superhuman task.The pneumonic type of infection, cases of which had already been detected, was now spreading all over the town; one could almost believe that the high winds were kindling and fanning its flames in people’s chests.The victims of pneumonic plague succumbed much more quickly, after coughing up blood-stained sputum.This new form of the epidemic looked like being more contagious as well as even more fatal.However, the opinions of experts had always been divided on this matter.For greater safety all sanitary workers wore masks of sterilized muslin.On the face of it, the disease should have extended its ravages.But, the cases of bubonic plague showing a decrease, the death-rate remained constant."
"同时，当局还有另一个担忧，那就是食物供应很难保证。投机商们趁火打劫，高价出售市面上短缺的日常必需的食品。于是，穷苦人家处于极其困难的境地，而有钱人家却几乎不缺任何东西。鼠疫传染对所有人都一视同仁，这本该增强市民们的平等感，但现在却产生了相反的效果，因为人类惯有的贪婪，反而加深了他们心里的不公平感，令人难以释怀。当然，他们在死亡面前毫无疑问还是平等的，但没人愿意享受这种平等。那些挨饿的穷人们更加怀念附近乡间的小镇和村庄，那里的面包不贵，生活也自由自在。事实上，他们产生了一种可能不合情理却又非常自然的想法：当局本该允许他们离开这里，搬到那些更幸福的地方去。这种想法反映在了大街上高呼的口号和墙上写着的标语里：“要么给面包，要么给新鲜空气！”这句有些讽刺的标语是号召人们进行示威游行的信号，尽管很快就顺利平息了下去，却使大家意识到一种不良情绪正在全城蔓延开来。","Meanwhile the authorities had another cause for anxiety in the difficulty of maintaining the food-supply.Profiteers were taking a hand and purveying at enormous prices essential foodstuffs not available in the shops.The result was that poor families were in great straits, while the rich went short of practically nothing.Thus, whereas plague by its impartial ministrations should have promoted equality among our townsfolk, it now had the opposite effect and, thanks to the habitual conflict of cupidities, exacerbated the sense of injustice rankling in men’s hearts.They were assured, of course, of the inerrable equality of death, but nobody wanted that kind of equality.Poor people who were feeling the pinch thought still more nostalgically of towns and villages in the near-by countryside, where bread was cheap and life without restrictions.Indeed, they had a natural if illogical feeling that they should have been permitted to move out to these happier places.The feeling was embodied in a slogan shouted in the streets and chalked up on walls: “Bread or fresh air!”This half-ironical battle-cry was the signal for some demonstrations that, though easily repressed, made everyone aware that an ugly mood was developing among us."
"不用说，报纸还是服从上面的命令：不惜一切代价来宣扬乐观主义。据报纸所言，全城居民都是“勇气和镇静的典范”。但在这样一座与世隔绝、什么事情都无法保密的城市里，没人会对这个公众给出的“典范”存有幻想。要想对记者们所说的勇气和镇静有个确切的理解，人们只需到当局设立的检疫站或隔离营去看看就清楚了。但在这时，笔者正在别处忙于事务，没有机会前去任何一处隔离场所，因此还得引用一下塔鲁在笔记中对这些场所状况所作的描述。","The newspapers, needless to say, complied with the instructions given them: optimism at all costs.If one was to believe what one read in them, our populace was giving “a fine example of courage and composure.”But in a town thrown back upon itself, in which nothing could be kept secret, no one had illusions about the “example” given by the public.To form a correct idea about the courage and composure talked about by our journalists you had only to visit one of the quarantine depots or isolation camps established by our authorities.As it so happens, the narrator, being fully occupied elsewhere, had no occasion to visit any of them, and must fall back on Tarrou’s diary for a description of the conditions in these places."
"塔鲁记载了他和朗贝尔一起前往设在市体育场的一个隔离营进行探访的情况。这个体育场位于市郊，它一面临街，街上有电车通行，另一面则是一片空地，这空地一直延伸至奥兰城所在的高原的边缘。体育场被高高的水泥墙环绕着，只需在四个出入口设置些岗哨就几乎无人可以逃得出去。高墙还有另一个作用：使在墙外大街上行走的人们无法看见墙内这些接受隔离检疫的不幸者。与此益处相对应的便是这样一个现实：高墙内的人们尽管看不见电车，却整天都可以听见它们驶过的声音，而且可以根据街上传来的越来越大的动静判断出上下班时间。这也使他们意识到，他们被排除在生活之外，但生活却在几米开外的地方一如既往地继续着，而这高高的水泥墙分隔开的是两个迥然不同的世界，就像是两个不同的星球。","Tarrou gives an account of a visit he made, accompanied by Rambert, to the camp located in the municipal stadium.The stadium lies on the outskirts of the town, between a street along which runs a car line and a stretch of waste land extending to the extreme edge of the plateau on which Oran is built.It was already surrounded by high concrete walls and all that was needed to make escape practically impossible was to post sentries at the four entrance gates.The walls served another purpose: they screened the unfortunates in quarantine from the view of people on the road.Against this advantage may be set the fact that the inmates could hear all day, though they could not see them, the passing streetcars, and recognize by the increased volume of sound coming from the road the hours when people had knocked off work or were going to it.And this brought home to them that the life from which they were debarred was going on as before, within a few yards of them, and that those high walls parted two worlds as alien to each other as two different planets."
"塔鲁和朗贝尔决定在一个周日下午前往这个体育场。一同前往的还有那个足球运动员冈萨雷斯，朗贝尔与他取得了联系，并说服他负责这个隔离营的轮流看管任务。朗贝尔想通过此行将冈萨雷斯介绍给隔离营主管。那天下午他们刚一见面，冈萨雷斯就说，在鼠疫发生前，他正是在这个时间开始穿上球衣准备比赛的。由于体育场都被征用了，一切都已成为了过去，所以现在冈萨雷斯感到——这感觉也写在他脸上——无所事事。这是他接受朗贝尔提议的这项工作的一个原因，但他也提了一个条件，那就是他只负责周末值班。","Tarrou and Rambert chose a Sunday afternoon for their visit to the stadium.They were accompanied by Gonzales, the football-player, with whom Rambert had kept in contact and who had let himself be persuaded into undertaking, in rotation with others, the surveillance of the camp.This visit was to enable Rambert to introduce Gonzales to the camp commandant.When they met that afternoon, Gonzales’s first remark was that this was exactly the time when, before the plague, he used to start getting into his football togs.Now that the sports fields had been requisitioned, all that was of the past, and Gonzales was feeling—and showed it—at a loose end.This was one of the reasons why he had accepted the post proposed by Rambert, but he made it a condition that he was to be on duty during weekends only."
"那天的天空阴阴的，冈萨雷斯仰望天空，颇感遗憾地说，这种既不炎热又不下雨的天气是最适合举行球赛的了。接着，他又竭力回忆起更衣室里那股熟悉的擦剂的味道，挤满了观众的看台，黄褐色球场上运动员们绚丽多彩的球衣，中场休息时的柠檬或者冒着瓶装的柠檬水，用一千种清凉提神的小刺激挑逗着干渴的喉咙。塔鲁在笔记中还写道，当他们沿着郊区破旧街道一路前行之时，这个足球运动员把每一个散落的小石子都当足球来踢。他的目标就是将石子踢进下水道的洞里去，而他每踢一脚，都会大叫一声：“射门！”当他抽完了一支烟，就会把烟蒂往前一吐，在它落地之前用脚把它接住。有一些孩子正在体育场附近玩球，当其中的一个孩子把球朝他们三个人踢过来时，冈萨雷斯上前把球干净利落地踢了回去。","The sky was overcast and, glancing up at it, Gonzales observed regretfully that a day like this, neither too hot nor rainy, would have been perfect for a game.And then he fell to conjuring up, as best he could, the once familiar smell of embrocation in the dressing-rooms, the stands crowded with people, the colored shirts of the players, showing up brightly against the tawny soil, the lemons at intermission or bottled lemonade that titillated parched throats with a thousand refreshing pin-pricks.Tarrou also records how on the way, as they walked the shabby outer streets, the footballer gave kicks to all the small loose stones.His object was to shoot them into the sewer-holes of the gutters, and whenever he did this, he would shout: “Goal!”When he had finished his cigarette he spat the stub in front of him and tried to catch it on his toe before it touched the ground.Some children were playing near the stadium, and when one of them sent a ball toward the three men, Gonzales went out of his way to return it neatly."
"当他们走进体育场时，他们发现看台上挤满了人。运动场上搭起了几百个红色帐篷，可以瞥见帐篷里有些寝具以及一堆堆的衣物或毯子。看台依然开放着，住在场内的人们在天热或下雨时可以呆在那里。但隔离营规定，太阳落山时每个人都得回到帐篷里去。看台下面安装了淋浴设备，而原来运动员的更衣室被改为了办公室和医务室。大多数住在这个隔离营地的人现在都坐在看台上。不过，也有一些人在运动场边缘徘徊，还有少数几个人蹲在帐篷入口处，无精打采地打量着周围的一切。在看台上，坐在木制阶梯上的许多人都带着一种茫然期待的神情。","On entering the stadium they found the stands full of people.The field was dotted with several hundred red tents, inside which one had glimpses of bedding and bundles of clothes or rugs.The stands had been kept open for the use of the internees in hot or rainy weather.But it was a rule of the camp that everyone must be in his tent at sunset.Shower-baths had been installed under the stands, and what used to be the players’ dressingrooms converted into offices and infirmaries.The majority of the inmates of the camp were sitting about on the stands.Some, however, were strolling on the touchlines, and a few, squatting at the entrances of their tents, were listlessly contemplating the scene around them.In the stands many of those slumped on the wooden tiers had a look of vague expectancy."
"“他们整天都做些什么？”塔鲁问朗贝尔。","“What do they do with themselves all day?” Tarrou asked Rambert."
"“什么事也不做。”","“Nothing.”"
"的确，几乎所有人都空着双手，懒洋洋地晃动着双臂。另一个奇怪之处是，这一大群被遗弃的人都很沉默。","Almost all, indeed, had empty hands and idly dangling arms.Another curious thing about this multitude of derelicts was its silence."
"“他们刚到这来的时候特别吵，根本静不下来，”朗贝尔说，“但随着日子一天天过去，他们就变得越来越沉默了。”","“When they first came there was such a din you couldn’t hear yourself speak,” Rambert said.“But as the days went by they grew quieter and quieter.”"
"对于人们的这种变化，塔鲁在笔记里谈了自己的看法。在他看来，这些人在最初的日子里挤在帐篷里，听苍蝇嗡嗡的叫声，在自己身上东抓西挠，一遇到有人愿意听他们就大声地诉说他们内心的害怕或愤怒。但是，随着隔离营里人数变得越来越多，越来越少的人愿意充当富有同情心的听众了。于是他们别无选择，只得沉默不语，对任何事任何人都有所猜疑。人们确实可以感受到，一股猜疑的浓雾正从灰蒙蒙的天空压下来，笼罩着这个红色隔离营。","In his notes Tarrou gives what to his mind would explain this change.He pictures them in the early days bundled together in the tents, listening to the buzz of flies, scratching themselves, and, whenever they found an obliging listener, shrilly voicing their fear or indignation.But when the camp grew overcrowded, fewer and fewer people were inclined to play the part of sympathetic listener.So they had no choice but to hold their peace and nurse their mistrust of everything and everyone.One had, indeed, a feeling that suspicion was falling, dewlike, from the grayly shining sky over the brick-red camp."
"是的，他们每个人都带着一种猜疑的眼神。很显然，他们认为这里的人们被隔离一定是事出有因的，所以他们的脸上带着一种若有所思又有些害怕的神情。塔鲁看到的每个人都是目光呆滞，显然是因为他们与原来的生活完全隔离而感到痛苦所致。因为他们不能总想着死的问题，所以他们干脆什么也不去想。他们把这当作是度假。“但最糟糕的是，”塔鲁写道，“他们已被人遗忘，而他们对此也很清楚。他们的朋友已经忘了他们，因为朋友们要想别的事情，这很自然。而他们的亲人也忘了他们，因为亲人们一门心思在计划安排着把他们弄出隔离营。他们的亲人一心想着这些把他们解救出去的计划与安排，因而把他们本人给忘了。不过，这也很自然。事实就是这样：即使在最不幸的时候，也没有谁能够真正地想着他人。要真正地想着一个人，就意味着每一分每一秒都要想着这个人，不为任何事情分心——无论是吃饭，是苍蝇停在脸上，是家务事，还是身上某处突然发痒。但苍蝇和发痒总是难免的。所以说生活真是不易。这里的人们都很清楚这一点。”","Yes, there was suspicion in the eyes of all.Obviously, they were thinking, there must be some good reason for the isolation inflicted on them, and they had the air of people who are puzzling over their problem and are afraid.Everyone Tarrou set eyes on had that vacant gaze and was visibly suffering from the complete break with all that life had meant to him.And since they could not be thinking of their death all the time, they thought of nothing.They were on vacation.“But worst of all,” Tarrou writes, “is that they’re forgotten, and they know it.Their friends have forgotten them because they have other things to think about, naturally enough.And those they love have forgotten them because all their energies are devoted to making schemes and taking steps to get them out of the camp.And by dint of always thinking about these schemes and steps they have ceased thinking about those whose release they’re trying to secure.And that, too, is natural enough.In fact, it comes to this: nobody is capable of really thinking about anyone, even in the worst calamity.For really to think about someone means thinking about that person every minute of the day, without letting one’s thoughts be diverted by anything—by meals, by a fly that settles on one’s cheek, by household duties, or by a sudden itch somewhere.But there are always flies and itches.That’s why life is difficult to live.And these people know it only too well.”"
"隔离营的主管走了过来，他说有位奥顿先生想见见他们。他让冈萨雷斯留在办公室，领着塔鲁和朗贝尔朝看台的一个角落走去，奥顿先生正孤零零地坐在那里。他一看到他们就站起身来。这位地方治安官的衣着打扮一如从前，依然戴着那条硬领。塔鲁发现，治安官的唯一变化就是两鬓的头发不再整齐地往后梳着，而且有一只鞋子的鞋带也没系好。奥顿先生看起来很疲惫，说话时从不正视对方。他说，他很高兴见到他们，并请求他们转告里厄，他很感谢医生为他所做的一切。","The camp manager came up; a gentleman named Othon, he said, would like to see them.Leaving Gonzales in the office, he led the others to a corner of the grandstand, where they saw M. Othon sitting by himself.He rose as they approached.The magistrate was dressed exactly as in the past and still wore a stiff collar.The only changes Tarrou noted were that the tufts of hair over his temples were not brushed back and that one of his shoelaces was undone.M. Othon appeared very tired and not once did he look his visitors in the face.He said he was glad to see them and requested them to thank Dr. Rieux for all he had done."
"接下来是一阵沉默，治安官费了点儿劲才又说道：","Some moments of silence ensued, then with an effort the magistrate spoke again: "
"“我希望雅克没有受太多的苦。”","“I hope Jacques did not suffer too much.”"
"这是塔鲁第一次听奥顿提到自己儿子的名字，因此他意识到事情有了变化。太阳慢慢落山了，阳光穿透云层的缺口，斜照在看台上，给他们三人的脸染上了一层金黄色。","This was the first time Tarrou heard him utter his son’s name, and he realized that something had changed.The sun was setting and, flooding through a rift in the clouds, the level rays raked the stands, tingeing their faces with a yellow glow."
"“没有，”塔鲁说，“没有，他确实没有受苦。”","“No,” Tarrou said.“No, I couldn’t really say he suffered.”"
"他们离开的时候，治安官继续凝望着落日的余辉。","When they took their leave, the magistrate was still gazing toward the light."
"他们去办公室向冈萨雷斯告别，这时他正在研究轮班值勤表。这位足球队员笑着和他们握手。","They called in at the office to say good-by to Gonzales, whom they found studying the duty roster.The footballer was laughing when he shook hands with them."
"“毕竟，我又回到以前这间老更衣室来了，”他笑着说，“日子又有盼头了。”","“Anyhow, I’m back in the good old dressing-room,” he chuckled.“That’s something to go on with.”"
"过了一会儿，当隔离营主管送塔鲁和朗贝尔出去的时候，看台上传来一阵噼啪声。不一会儿，那些以往用来宣布比赛结果或介绍球队的扬声器里播放起通知来，要这些住在隔离营里的人们回到自己的帐篷去吃晚餐。人们慢腾腾地排成纵队离开了看台，拖着步子朝帐篷走去。所有人都回到帐篷后，两辆小电车，也就是火车站月台上运行李的那种车，开始在帐篷间穿梭行进。人们一伸出胳臂，两只长柄勺子就伸进车上的两个大锅里，将锅里的食物捞出来，干净利索地倒进餐盒里。接着，电车又朝下一个帐篷驶去。","Soon after, when the camp manager was seeing Tarrou and Rambert out, they heard a crackling noise coming from the stands.A moment later the loud-speakers, which in happier times served to announce the results of games or to introduce the teams, informed the inmates of the camp that they were to go back to their tents for the evening meal.Slowly everyone filed off the stands and shuffled toward the tents.After all were under canvas two small electric trucks, of the kind used for transporting baggage on railroad platforms, began to wend their way between the tents.While the occupants held forth their arms, two ladles plunged into the two big caldrons on each truck and neatly tipped their contents into the waiting mess-kits.Then the truck moved on to the next tent."
"“效率很高。”塔鲁评论道。","“Very efficient,” Tarrou remarked."
"主管满面笑容地与他们握手告别。“是的，不是吗？我们这个隔离营是很讲效率的。”","The camp manager beamed as he shook hands.“Yes, isn’t it?We’re great believers in efficiency in this camp.”"
"夜幕慢慢降临了。天空明朗，隔离营沐浴在一片清凉而柔和的暮色之中。傍晚的宁静中响起了一阵阵小勺和盘子轻轻的碰撞声。几只蝙蝠在帐篷上空盘旋，又突然消失在夜幕之中。墙外传来一辆有轨电车在轨道岔口发出的吱嘎声。","Dusk was falling.The sky had cleared and the camp was bathed in cool, soft light.Through the hush of evening came a faint tinkle of spoons and plates.Above the tents bats were circling, vanishing abruptly into the darkness.A streetcar squealed on a switch outside the walls."
"“可怜的奥顿先生！”塔鲁在跨出隔离营大门时低声说，“真想做些什么帮他一把。但是你怎样才能帮上一位治安官呢？","“Poor Monsieur Othon!” Tarrou murmured as the gate closed behind them.“One would like to do something to help him.But how can you help a judge?”"
"第二十三章","Chapter 23"
"奥兰城里还有另外几处非常类似的隔离营，但由于笔者对此缺乏第一手资料，为了审慎起见，就不再赘述了。但是，有一点倒是可以再提一提：这些隔离营的存在以及从那里散发出来的拥挤人群的气味，黄昏时分那里的扬声器发出的叫嚣声，弥漫在隔离营四周的神秘氛围，还有这些禁区所引起的恐惧感——这一切都严重影响了市民们的士气，也加重了大家内心的不安与忧虑。扰乱和平的行为与小型的骚乱变得更加频繁起来。","There were other camps of much the same kind in the town, but the narrator, for lack of first-hand information and in deference to veracity, has nothing to add about them.This much, however, he can say; the mere existence of these camps, the smell of crowded humanity coming from them, the baying of their loud-speakers in the dusk, the air of mystery that clung about them, and the dread these forbidden places inspired told seriously on our fellow citizens’ morale and added to the general nervousness and apprehension.Breaches of the peace and minor riots became more frequent."
"到了11月底，早晨变凉了许多。大雨过后，街道被冲洗得干干净净，天空也像是被洗过了一样万里无云。早晨，整座城市都沐浴在清冷而熠熠发亮的阳光中。但是，夜幕降临时，天气却又回暖了。塔鲁正是选了这样一个夜晚来与里厄医生谈心。","As November drew to a close, the mornings turned much colder.Heavy downpours had scoured the streets and washed the sky clean of clouds.In the mornings a weak sunlight bathed the town in a cold, sparkling sheen.The air warmed up, however, as night approached.It was such a night that Tarrou chose for telling something of himself to Dr. Rieux."
"这天晚上十点左右，在度过了一个特别劳累的白天之后，塔鲁提出要跟里厄医生一起去看望那位老气喘病人。柔和的星光撒在老城区的房屋上空，一阵微风吹过十字路口，轻拂着他们的脸庞。走过几条寂静的街道之后，他们来到了老人家中，一见面老人就向他们唠叨个没完，令他们有些厌烦。他一开口就斥责起那些靠着肥差养活的家伙来，说美差总是落到他们手中，但情况一定不会永远如此，有一天人们一定会——这时他搓了搓双手——“大吵一番”。在医生护理他的时候，他一直不停地针砭时局。","After a particularly tiring day, about ten o’clock Tarrou proposed to the doctor that they should go together for the evening visit to Rieux’s old asthma patient.There was a soft glow above the housetops in the Old Town and a light breeze fanned their faces at the street crossings.Coming from the silent streets, they found the old man’s loquacity rather irksome at first.He launched into a long harangue to the effect that some folks were getting fed up, that it was always the same people had all the jam, and things couldn’t go on like that indefinitely, one day there’d be—he rubbed his hands—“a fine old row.”He continued expatiating on this theme all the time the doctor was attending to him."
"他们听到楼上响起了脚步声。看到塔鲁正在抬头张望，病人的老伴解释说，是隔壁的女孩们在露台上走动。她还说，露台上可以看到很美的风景，而且由于这个地区相邻屋子的露台有一边是连在一起的，所以女人们足不出户就可以到邻居家串门。","They heard footsteps overhead.Noticing Tarrou’s upward glance, the old woman explained that it was the girls from next door walking on the terrace.She added that one had a lovely view up there, and that as the terraces in this part of the town often joined up with the next one on one side, the women could visit their neighbors without having to go into the street."
"“你们为什么不上去看看呢？”老人说，“那里空气非常新鲜。”","“Why not go up and have a look?” the old man suggested.“You’ll get a breath of nice fresh air.”"
"他们上了露台，发现那里并没有人——只有三把空椅子。从一边远远望去，一排露台向远处延伸至一个黑乎乎的、岩石般的物体，他们认出这是离城里最近的一座小山冈。从另一边望过去，越过几条街道和看不见的港口，视线最后停留在了地平线上，那里海天相接，汇成了一片模糊又不断起伏的灰白色。他们知道，远处那漆黑一片的东西就是悬崖，悬崖上空，一束微光很有规律地一闪一闪，但他们看不见光源。航道口上的灯塔一直都在为那些途经奥兰停运的港口后驶往其他港口的船只发出信号。晚风吹拂，星星在皎洁的夜空中闪着银光，时不时因为灯塔发出的黄色光束而黯然失色。微风中飘过来一股香草和石头的味道。","They found nobody on the terrace—only three empty chairs.On one side, as far as eye could reach, was a row of terraces, the most remote of which abutted on a dark, rugged mass that they recognized as the hill nearest the town.On the other side, spanning some streets and the unseen harbor, their gaze came to rest on the horizon, where sea and sky merged in a dim, vibrant grayness.Beyond a black patch that they knew to be the cliffs a sudden glow, whose source they could not see, sprang up at regular intervals; the lighthouse at the entrance of the fairway was still functioning for the benefit of ships that, passing Oran’s unused harbor, went on to other ports along the coast.In a sky swept crystal-clear by the night wind, the stars showed like silver flakes, tarnished now and then by the yellow gleam of the revolving light.Perfumes of spice and warm stone were wafted on the breeze."
"四周一片寂静。","Everything was very still."
"“这里真舒服，”里厄一边挑了张椅子坐下，一边说，“好像鼠疫从未到过这里似的。”","“A pleasant spot,” said Rieux as he lowered himself into a chair.“You’d think that plague had never found its way up here.”"
"塔鲁背对着医生，往大海方向望去。","Tarrou was gazing seawards, his back to the doctor."
"“对，”他沉默了一会儿回答说，“在这里真舒服。”","“Yes,” he replied after a moment’s silence, “it’s good to be here.”"
"接着，他在里厄身旁坐下，目不转睛地看着医生。一道光掠过夜空，消失不见了，这样出现了三次。从街上一间房门大开的屋子里隐约传来一阵餐具的碰撞声。屋子里有一扇门发出砰的一声。","Then, settling into the chair beside Rieux, he fixed his eyes on his face.Three times the glow spread up the sky and died away.A faint clatter of crockery rose from a room opening on the street below.A door banged somewhere in the house."
"“里厄，”塔鲁用非常自然的语调问，“你从未想过要了解我——了解我这个人吗？你把我当朋友吗？”","“Rieux,” Tarrou said in a quite ordinary tone, “do you realize that you’ve never tried to find out anything about me-the man I am?Can I regard you as a friend?”"
"“是的，我们当然是朋友，只是我们一直没有时间好好谈谈。”","“Yes, of course, we’re friends; only so far we haven’t had much time to show it.”"
"“太好了。这样我就有信心了。让我们现在就腾出一个小时的时间——来共叙友情怎么样？”","“Good.That gives me confidence.Suppose we now take an hour off—for friendship?”"
"里厄笑了笑，算是回答。","Rieux smiled by way of answer."
"“嗯，说吧！”","“Well, here goes!”"
"几条街开外传来了汽车在湿漉漉的路面上滑行所发出的一阵微弱的、长长的嘶嘶声。这种声音逐渐消失了，接着从远处传来一阵模糊的喊叫声又再次打破了宁静。然后，就像有层厚厚的面纱慢慢从星空降落到二人身上一般，又恢复了平静。塔鲁挪动了位置，现在坐在露台的栏杆上，面对着全身放松坐在椅子上的里厄。他能看得见的只是熠熠星空下医生那庞大的黑色身形。他有很多话要说，下面是他所说的大致内容：","There was a long faint hiss some streets off, the sound of a car speeding on the wet pavement.It died away; then some vague shouts a long way off broke the stillness again.Then, like a dense veil slowly falling from the starry sky on the two men, silence returned.Tarrou had moved and now was sitting on the parapet, facing Rieux, who was slumped back in his chair.All that could be seen of him was a dark, bulky form outlined against the glimmering sky.He had much to tell; what follows gives it more or less in his own words."
"“里厄，我首先要说的是，在我来到这个城市、遇上这次鼠疫以前，我早就受着鼠疫的折磨。可以说，其实大家也与我一样。只是有一些人并不察觉或者安于现状，另一些人则有所察觉并想要寻求摆脱而已。而我自己一直以来都在设法摆脱。","“To make things simpler, Rieux, let me begin by saying I had plague already, long before I came to this town and encountered it here.Which is tantamount to saying I’m like everybody else.Only there are some people who don’t know it, or feel at ease in that condition; others know and want to get out of it.Personally, I’ve always wanted to get out of it."
"“我年轻时过着天真无邪的日子,也就是说，那时的我没有任何思想。我不是那种自寻烦恼的人，所以年轻时的生活过得很好。每一件事我都做得很好，我才华出众，与女人相处甚好，如果偶尔有些忧虑，那它们也是来去匆匆。但有一天，我开始思考了。而现在——”","“When I was young I lived with the idea of my innocence; that is to say, with no idea at all.I’m not the selftormenting kind of person, and I made a suitable start in life.I brought off everything I set my hand to, I moved at ease in the field of the intellect, I got on excellently with women, and if I had occasional qualms, they passed as lightly as they came.Then one day I started thinking.And now—”"
"“我该告诉你，我年轻时不像你那么穷。我父亲身居要职——他是检察官，不过，他起来，一点儿也不像个检察官；他不仅面相和善，而且天性善良。我母亲是个淳朴而谦逊的女人，我一直很爱她，但我不愿意谈论她。我父亲一直对我很好，我甚至认为他一直都在设法了解我。他不是位模范丈夫。这一点我现在很清楚，但并不为此而感到特别吃惊。即使他有外遇，他依然举止得体，从未招致流言蜚语。总之，他这人一点儿也不古怪，现在他已去世，我认为他虽然不是圣人君子，可也算得上是个体面之人。他介乎于圣人和坏人之间，就是这样。他这种人能引起别人对他的一种虽不强烈却很坚定的好感——这种好感是经久不衰的。","I should tell you I wasn’t poor in my young days, as you were.My father had an important post—he was prosecuting attorney; but to look at him, you’d never have guessed it; he appeared, and was, a kindly, goodnatured man.My mother was a simple, rather shy woman, and I’ve always loved her greatly; but I’d rather not talk about her.My father was always very kind to me, and I even think he tried to understand me.He wasn’t a model husband.I know that now, but I can’t say it shocks me particularly.Even in his infidelities he behaved as one could count on his behaving and never gave rise to scandal.In short, he wasn’t at all original and, now he’s dead, I realize that, while no plaster saint, he was a very decent man as men go.He kept the middle way, that’s all; he was the type of man for whom one has an affection of the mild but steady order—which is the kind that wears best."
"“我父亲有一个特点，那本《火车时刻表》是他的枕边书。这不是说他经常坐火车，他好像只到过布列塔尼旅行，在那里他有一幢乡间小别墅，所以每年暑假我们都会过去。但他是张活的火车时刻表，他能精确地告诉你巴黎至柏林之间列车的发站和到站时间，从里昂到华沙该乘坐什么时间、什么车次的火车，以及各大首都之间的确切距离。你能不假思索地告诉我从布里扬松到沙莫尼该怎么走吗？我要说，即使是个火车站站长也会抓耳挠腮地想一会儿。但我父亲却能对答如流。几乎每天晚上他都会积累自己在这方面的知识，并为此感到自豪。他的这种爱好令我感到很有趣，我会向他提一些旅行方面难以回答的问题，然后用那本《火车时刻表》来核实他的答案。他的回答始终都是对的。晚上的这些游戏使我和父亲相处甚欢，我就是他的忠实听众，全神贯注、充满敬意。在我看来，他在这方面所取得的成绩并不亚于他在其他方面的成绩。","“My father had one peculiarity; the big railway directory was his bedside book.Not that he often took a train; almost his only journeys were to Brittany, where he had a small country house to which we went every summer.But he was a walking timetable; he could tell you the exact times of departure and arrival of the Paris-Berlin expresses; how to get from Lyon to Warsaw, which trains to take and at what hours; the precise distance between any two capital cities you might mention.Could you tell me offhand how to get from Briancon to Chamonix?Even a station-master would scratch his head, I should say.Well, my father had the answer pat.Almost every evening he enlarged his knowledge of the subject, and he prided himself on it.This hobby of his much amused me; I would put complicated travel problems to him and check his answers afterwards by the railway directory.They were invariably correct.My father and I got on together excellently, thanks largely to these railway games we played in the evenings; I was exactly the audience he needed, attentive and appreciative.Personally I regarded this accomplishment of his as quite as admirable in its ways as most accomplishments."
"“但我说得有点忘乎所以了，把他这样一位优秀人物说得也太好了。对于我后面要谈到的我在思想上发生的重大变化，他其实只起到了间接的作用。他对我的影响至多也就是引发了我的一连串思考罢了。在我十七岁那年，我父亲叫我去听他的法庭陈述。这是在刑事法庭审理的一桩重大案件，也许他想在我面前大显身手一番。我也猜想他希望这种法庭审理的盛况能深深地打动我，并激励我去继承父业。看得出来，我父亲热切希望我能出席，而我也很想前去看看他在家庭之外是个什么样子。完全是出于这些原因，我去旁听了这次审判。我一直以为开庭的情况就像7月14日的国庆检阅或学校授奖日一样，是非常自然、井然有序的。我对这方面的概念很抽象，也从来没有认真思考过这个问题。","“But I’m letting my tongue run away with me and attributing too much importance to that worthy man.Actually he played only an indirect role in the great change of heart about which I want to tell you.The most he did to me was to touch off a train of thoughts.When I was seventeen my father asked me to come to hear him speak in court.There was a big case on at the assizes, and probably he thought I’d see him to his best advantage.Also I suspect he hoped I’d be duly impressed by the pomp and ceremony of the law and encouraged to take up his profession.I could tell he was keen on my going, and the prospect of seeing a side of my father’s character so different from that we saw at home appealed to me.Those were absolutely the only reasons I had for going to the trial.What happened in a court had always seemed to me as natural, as much in the order of things, as a military parade on the Fourteenth of July or a school speech day.My notions on the subject were purely abstract, and I’d never given it serious thought."
"“那天的诉讼留给我的唯一印象就是那个罪犯。我相信他是有罪的——犯了什么罪并不重要。这人三十岁左右，个子矮小，头发稀疏，呈黄棕色，似乎很想招供一切罪行，似乎对他所做的一切以及他将要受到的惩罚感到万分恐惧，以至于几分钟之后，我的视线完全被他吸引住了。他看起来就像是一只被强光吓得不知所措的猫头鹰。他的领结歪在一边，不停地啃着一只手的指甲，他右手的指甲……我不必再说了，对吧？你很清楚——他是一个活生生的人。","“The only picture I carried away with me of that day’s proceedings was a picture of the criminal.I have little doubt he was guilty—of what crime is no great matter.That little man of about thirty, with sparse, sandy hair, seemed so eager to confess everything, so genuinely horrified at what he’d done and what was going to be done with him, that after a few minutes I had eyes for nothing and nobody else.He looked like a yellow owl scared blind by too much light.His tie was slightly awry, he kept biting his nails, those of one hand only, his right....I needn’t go on, need I?You’ve understood—he was a living human being."
"“而我是恍然大悟，突然意识到这一点的；在这之前，我只是把他看作是官方所称的‘被告’。尽管我不能说我已全然忘记父亲在场，但那时我的内心像是被什么攫住了一样，所有的注意力都被被告席里的这个矮个子男人吸引住了。我几乎什么也没听见，我只知道他们要杀死这个活生生的人，而且我内心涌起的一种本能如潮水一般将我推向了矮个子那一边。直到父亲起身宣读起诉书时，我才真正清醒过来。","“As for me, it came on me suddenly, in a flash of understanding; until then I’d thought of him only under his commonplace official designation, as ‘the defendant.’ And though I can’t say I quite forgot my father, something seemed to grip my vitals at that moment and riveted all my attention on the little man in the dock.I hardly heard what was being said; I only knew that they were set on killing that living man, and an uprush of some elemental instinct, like a wave, had swept me to his side.And I did not really wake up until my father rose to address the court."
"“穿着红色法袍的父亲就像是变了一个人，不再亲切，也不再善良，他的嘴里没完没了地吐出一大串毒蛇般的过于夸张的词句。我知道他正在以社会的名义向陪审团说明这个犯人有罪，因而要求处死此人，他甚至要求将犯人砍头。当然，我记不清他具体说了些什么。法庭上的套语就是‘他应该被处以极刑’。不过这两句话真的差别不大，而且结果都一样。他最终取下了犯人的头。只不过并非他亲自去执行这项工作罢了。我一直在旁观看整个案子的审理，等到最后判决时，我对这个不幸的人更是倍感亲切、可怕的亲切，而我父亲是永远也不可能感觉到的。毕竟，在处决犯人时——说得文雅一些，是在所谓犯人的最后时刻，而实质上应该说是在最卑鄙的谋杀时刻——我父亲因职责所需是必须出席的。","“In his red gown he was another man, no longer genial or good-natured; his mouth spewed out long, turgid phrases like an endless stream of snakes.I realized he was clamoring for the prisoner’s death, telling the jury that they owed it to society to find him guilty; he went so far as to demand that the man should have his head cut off.Not exactly in those words, I admit.‘He must pay the supreme penalty,’ was the formula.But the difference, really, was slight, and the result the same.He had the head he asked for.Only of course it wasn’t he who did the actual job.I, who saw the whole business through to its conclusion, felt a far closer, far more terrifying intimacy with that wretched man than my father can ever have felt.Nevertheless, it fell to him, in the course of his duties, to be present at what’s politely termed the prisoner’s last moments, but what would be better called murder in its most despicable form."
"“从那天起，我一看到那本《火车时刻表》就感到一阵厌恶。我开始极度关心起审判、死刑和处决来，并吃惊地发现，我父亲一定已经多次见证过这些残暴的谋杀——据我观察，不用猜也知道，每逢这种日子他就起得特别早。我记得，他在这种时候往往会上好闹钟发条来提醒自己早起。我不敢向母亲提起这事，但那时我开始更细致地观察她，发现父母之间的共同生活已经没有任何意义，她对感情已不报任何希望了。这让我‘原谅了她’，正如我当时所想的那样。后来，我懂了，对她也无所谓原谅；结婚前她家里很穷，是贫穷让她学会了逆来顺受。","“From that day on I couldn’t even see the railway directory without a shudder of disgust.I took a horrified interest in legal proceedings, death sentences, executions, and I realized with dismay that my father must have often witnessed those brutal murders—on the days when, as I’d noticed without guessing what it meant, he rose very early in the morning.I remembered he used to wind his alarm-clock on those occasions, to make sure.I didn’t dare to broach the subject with my mother, but I watched her now more closely and saw that their life in common had ceased to mean anything, she had abandoned hope.That helped me to ‘forgive her,’ as I put it to myself at the time.Later on, I learned that there’d been nothing to forgive; she’d been quite poor until her marriage, and poverty had taught her resignation."
"“也许你以为我会告诉你，我当即就离家出走了。不，事实上，我在家里继续呆了好几个月，将近一年。有一天晚上，我父亲因为第二天要早起又在找他的闹钟。那晚我彻夜未眠。第二天他回到家里的时候，我已经走了。","“Probably you’re expecting me to tell you that I left home at once.No, I stayed on many months, nearly a year, in fact.Then one evening my father asked for the alarm-clock as he had to get up early.I couldn’t sleep that night.Next day, when he came home, I’d gone."
"“接下来的事就简单地说说吧，我父亲派人四处找我，我也收到了他的一封来信，于是我就去见他，见面时我什么也没有对他解释，只是心平气和地告诉他，要是他逼我回家，我就自杀。他最终还是同意我离去——正如我前面所说的，他天性善良——但他训斥了我一顿，认为我想过‘自由自在的生活’的行为是愚蠢的（他是这样理解我的行为的，我也没有点醒他），他还给我提了很多好的建议。我知道这是他的肺腑之言，他还努力不让眼中的泪水流下来。后来——不过是很久之后——我养成了定期回家去看望母亲的习惯，每次也见到了他。我想，我的父亲为这些不多的会面也感到知足了。至于我，我对他一点儿也不憎恶，只是内心有一丝惆怅。他去世时，我把母亲接来与我一起生活，要是她还健在的话，她现在还应陪在我身边。","“To cut a long story short, I had a letter from my father, who had set inquiries on foot to find me, I went to see him, and, without explaining my reasons, told him quite calmly that I’d kill myself if he forced me to return.He wound up by letting me have my way—he was, as I’ve said, a kindly man at bottom—gave me a lecture on the silliness of wanting to ‘live my life’ (that was how he accounted for my conduct and I didn’t undeceive him), and plenty of good advice.I could see he really felt it deeply and it was an effort for him to keep back his tears.Subsequently—but quite a long time after that—I formed a habit of visiting my mother periodically, and I always saw him on these occasions.I imagine these infrequent meetings satisfied my father.Personally, I hadn’t the least antipathy to him, only a little sadness of heart.When he died I had my mother come to live with me, and she’d still be with me if she were alive."
"“我刚才不得不详细叙述我早年的这段生活，因为它正是一切的起点。现在我要讲快些了。十八岁那年，我失去了安逸的生活，开始陷入贫困之中。我干过各种各样的工作，而且都干得还不错。但我真正关心的是死刑这个问题，我想为那个被告席上可怜的、手足无措的猫头鹰讨公道。因此，我成为了人们口中所说的煽动政治斗争的人。我不想成为一个传播疾病的人，仅此而已。在我看来，我身边的社会秩序是建立在死刑的基础之上的，因此，我要纠正这种既定的社会秩序，就要同谋杀作斗争。这就是我当时的想法，别人也对我这样说过，而且我现在依然认为我的这种观点本质上是正确的。我加入到一支我当时所爱的并且至今仍然爱着的队伍当中。我与队伍中的这些人密切合作了多年，在欧洲，只要哪个国家发生这类斗争，我都参与过。但这是题外话了。","“I’ve had to dwell on my start in life, since for me it really was the start of everything.I’ll get on more quickly now.I came to grips with poverty when I was eighteen, after an easy life till then.I tried all sorts of jobs, and I didn’t do too badly.But my real interest in life was the death penalty; I wanted to square accounts with that poor blind owl in the dock.So I became an agitator, as they say.I didn’t want to be pestiferous, that’s all.To my mind the social order around me was based on the death sentence, and by righting the established order I’d be fighting against murder.That was my view, others had told me so, and I still think that this belief of mine was substantially true.I joined forces with a group of people I then liked, and indeed have never ceased to like.I spent many years in close cooperation with them, and there’s not a country in Europe in whose struggles I haven’t played a part.But that’s another story."
"“不用说，我知道我们有时也判人死刑。但人们告诉我，为了建立一个不再有谋杀的新世界，这么少数几个人的死是不可避免的。这在当时也是对的——而现在我恐怕不能坚持这类真理了。无论他们作何解释，我都心有疑虑。但那时我想着被告席上悲惨的猫头鹰，就坚持了下去。直到有一天，我亲眼目睹了一次处决——那是在匈牙利——年少时经历的那种头晕目眩的恐惧又使得我感到眼前的一切都天旋地转起来。","“Needless to say, I knew that we, too, on occasion, passed sentences of death.But I was told that these few deaths were inevitable for the building up of a new world in which murder would cease to be.That also was true up to a point—and maybe I’m not capable of standing fast where that order of truths is concerned.Whatever the explanation, I hesitated.But then I remembered that miserable owl in the dock and it enabled me to keep on.Until the day when I was present at an execution—it was in Hungary—and exactly the same dazed horror that I’d experienced as a youngster made everything reel before my eyes."
"“你从未见过行刑队枪毙人吧？没有，当然没有。旁观者都是经过挑选的，就像私人晚会一样，客人是受邀前往的。至于结果，你只是从书本或图片中获得了一知半解而已。人绑在柱子上，眼睛蒙上布条，远处站着几个士兵。但事实根本不是这样。行刑队离犯人只有一米半的距离，这个你知道吗？要是犯人向前走两步，他的胸膛就会抵上枪口，这个你知道吗？在这么近的距离，士兵们将子弹集中打在犯人的心脏区，足足打出一个拳头大小的洞来，这个你知道吗？不，你对此一无所知，人们是从来都不会谈起这些细节的。对鼠疫患者来说，内心的平静比人的生命更可贵。正人君子就该享受整夜安眠，不是吗？的确，众所周知，只有情趣极其低下之人才会纠缠于这些细节。但我从那时起再也不能安睡了。我一直都情趣低下，不断地纠缠于这些细节，不断地思考着这些事情。","“Have you ever seen a man shot by a firing-squad?No, of course not; the spectators are hand-picked and it’s like a private party, you need an invitation.The result is that you’ve gleaned your ideas about it from books and pictures.A post, a blindfolded man, some soldiers in the offing.But the real thing isn’t a bit like that.Do you know that the firing-squad stands only a yard and a half from the condemned man?Do you know that if the victim took two steps forward his chest would touch the rifles?Do you know that, at this short range, the soldiers concentrate their fire on the region of the heart and their big bullets make a hole into which you could thrust your fist?No, you didn’t know all that; those are things that are never spoken of.For the plague-stricken their peace of mind is more important than a human life.Decent folks must be allowed to sleep easy o’ nights, mustn’t they?Really it would be shockingly bad taste to linger on such details, that’s common knowledge.But personally I’ve never been able to sleep well since then.The bad taste remained in my mouth and I’ve kept lingering on the details, brooding over them."
"“于是，我开始明白了，这么些年来，我满心以为自己一直是在与鼠疫作斗争，但荒谬至极的是，我自己竟然一直是个鼠疫患者。我知道我已经间接造成了千万人的死亡，因为我赞同这些最终导致死亡的行动和原则，这导致了他们的死亡。别人似乎并不为这样的想法而感到内疚，或者至少他们从未表达出自己的赞同。而我不同，我所了解的这一切简直是如梗在喉。我和他们在一起，但我依然感到孤独。当我谈起这些事时，他们就叫我不要生气，我该想些生死攸关的大事。接着，他们会提出一些理由，一些通常能深深打动人心的道理，硬要我接受那些我根本不能接受的东西。我回答说，那些穿着红色法袍的最为杰出的大鼠疫患者也会为他们的行为进行巧妙的辩解，而我要是同意那些略逊一筹的小鼠疫患者提出有关必然性和不可抗力的理由，那我也不能否定大鼠疫患者所说的理由。对于这一点，他们反驳说，要听从穿红色法袍之人的说法，最好的方法莫过于让他们垄断判死刑的权利。我的回答是，要是作了一次让步，就没有理由不继续作出让步。在我看来，历史也证实了我的这种想法，今天他们似乎在进行一项杀人比赛，看谁杀得更多。他们都杀红了眼，而且，即使他们不想杀人，他们也得不停地杀戮。","“And thus I came to understand that I, anyhow, had had plague through all those long years in which, paradoxically enough, I’d believed with all my soul that I was fighting it.I learned that I had had an indirect hand in the deaths of thousands of people; that I’d even brought about their deaths by approving of acts and principles which could only end that way.Others did not seem embarrassed by such thoughts, or anyhow never voiced them of their own accord.But I was different; what I’d come to know stuck in my gorge.I was with them and yet I was alone.When I spoke of these matters they told me not to be so squeamish; I should remember what great issues were at stake.And they advanced arguments, often quite impressive ones, to make me swallow what none the less I couldn’t bring myself to stomach.I replied that the most eminent of the plaguestricken, the men who wear red robes, also have excellent arguments to justify what they do, and once I admitted the arguments of necessity and force majeure put forward by the less eminent, I couldn’t reject those of the eminent.To which they retorted that the surest way of playing the game of the red robes was to leave to them the monopoly of the death penalty.My reply to this was that if you gave in once, there was no reason for not continuing to give in.It seems to me that history has borne me out; today there’s a sort of competition who will kill the most.They’re all mad over murder and they couldn’t stop killing men even if they wanted to."
"“不管怎样，我所关心的并非这些争辩。我所关心的是那只可怜的猫头鹰；通过那肮脏的法庭审理程序，一张张散发着鼠疫味的臭嘴向一个囚犯宣布他即将死去；一切都安排得科学合理，以便他在经受了一夜又一夜的精神折磨之后，可以平静地死去。我所关心的是那人胸口上的窟窿。同时，我也在告诉自己，至少就我而言，什么都不能让我接受这种认为屠杀有理的观点。是的，在我取得更清晰的认识之前，我决定要盲目地坚持下去。","“In any case, my concern was not with arguments.It was with the poor owl; with that foul procedure whereby dirty mouths stinking of plague told a fettered man that he was going to die, and scientifically arranged things so that he should die, after nights and nights of mental torture while he waited to be murdered in cold blood.My concern was with that hole in a man’s chest.And I told myself that meanwhile, so far anyhow as I was concerned, nothing in the world would induce me to accept any argument that justified such butcheries.Yes, I chose to be blindly obstinate, pending the day when I could see my way more clearly."
"“我现在还是这种想法。多年来，我一直感到羞愧，极度羞愧，因为即使我是出于好意，甚至与其保持距离，我依然充当了杀人凶手的角色。随着时间的流逝，我只是发现，即使是那些比别人更善良的人如今也无法避免杀人，或者任由别人去杀人，因为这符合他们生活的逻辑。我也发现，在这个世界上，我们的一举一动都可能会导致某人的死亡。是的，从那时起，我就一直感到羞愧，我已经意识到，我们都患上了鼠疫，于是我的内心不再安宁。如今，我依然还在设法寻找内心的安宁，我依然还在设法了解每一个人，不让自己成为任何人的死对头。我只知道，为了让自己摆脱鼠疫，该怎么做就得怎么做，而且只有这样，我们才有望获得安宁，或者，即使得不到安宁，也可以体面地死去。这样，而且只有这样才能减轻人们的痛苦，即使不能拯救他们，至少也可以让他们少受些伤害，甚至有时还可以为他们带来些好处。正因此如此，我决定一概拒绝接受致人死亡的事，或是为这种事进行的辩护，不管它是直接的还是间接的，也不管它有理没理。","“I’m still of the same mind.For many years I’ve been ashamed, mortally ashamed, of having been, even with the best intentions, even at many removes, a murderer in my turn.As time went on I merely learned that even those who were better than the rest could not keep themselves nowadays from killing or letting others kill, because such is the logic by which they live; and that we can’t stir a finger in this world without the risk of bringing death to somebody.Yes, I’ve been ashamed ever since; I have realized that we all have plague, and I have lost my peace.And today I am still trying to find it; still trying to understand all those others and not to be the mortal enemy of anyone.I only know that one must do what one can to cease being plague-stricken, and that’s the only way in which we can hope for some peace or, failing that, a decent death.This, and only this, can bring relief to men and, if not save them, at least do them the least harm possible and even, sometimes, a little good.So that is why I resolved to have no truck with any thing which, directly or indirectly, for good reasons or for bad, brings death to anyone or justifies others’ putting him to death."
"“也正因为如此，这场鼠疫并没有教会我任何新的东西，只是教会我该与你一起来抗击鼠疫。我可以肯定——对，里厄，我对这个世界了解得很透彻，这一点你可能也看出来了——我们每个人身上都有鼠疫病菌，世界上无人，无人可以幸免。而且，我也知道，我们必须时刻留心自己，不要一不小心把气呼到别人脸上而把鼠疫传染给他。细菌是自然而然存在的。而所有其他的东西——健康、正直、纯洁（假如你想拥有的话）——都是人类意志的产物，都是人类时刻保持警醒的产物。几乎不把病菌传染给任何人的善良之人，就是这种尽可能不分心的人。而要做到不分心，就要有强大的意志力，就要时刻保持高度的紧张状态。是的，里厄，当一个鼠疫患者是很累人的。但不想当鼠疫患者则更累人。因此，现在每个人看起来都很累，每个人都或多或少地染上了鼠疫。这就是为什么我们当中那些不想传染上鼠疫的人也因此而感到筋疲力尽；除了死亡之外，没有什么东西可以让他们摆脱这种极度的疲乏。","“That, too, is why this epidemic has taught me nothing new, except that I must fight it at your side.I know positively—yes, Rieux, I can say I know the world inside out, as you may see—that each of us has the plague within him; no one, no one on earth is free from it.And I know, too, that we must keep endless watch on ourselves lest in a careless moment we breathe in somebody’s face and fasten the infection on him.What’s natural is the microbe.All the rest—health, integrity, purity (if you like)—is a product of the human will, of a vigilance that must never falter.The good man, the man who infects hardly anyone, is the man who has the fewest lapses of attention.And it needs tremendous will-power, a never ending tension of the mind, to avoid such lapses.Yes, Rieux, it’s a wearying business, being plague-stricken.But it’s still more wearying to refuse to be it.That’s why everybody in the world today looks so tired; everyone is more or less sick of plague.But that is also why some of us, those who want to get the plague out of their systems, feel such desperate weariness, a weariness from which nothing remains to set us free except death."
"“我知道，一直到完全解脱为止，我在世上已没什么存在价值，从我毅然放弃杀人那时起，我就对自己宣判了永久的流放。我让其他人去创造历史。我也知道，我没有资格去评判这些人。我的头脑组织缺乏某种思想，这使我无法做一个理性的杀人凶手。因此，这是个缺点，而不是个优点。但照目前情况来看，我还是愿意做现在的我，我已经学会了谦虚。我要说的是，这个地球上存在各种瘟疫和受害者，而我们应该尽可能地不站在瘟疫这一边，与之合力。这也许听起来很简单，甚至有些幼稚；我不知道这是否很简单，但我知道这是事实。你看，我听过许多大道理，它们几乎把我弄得晕头转向，也令许多人冲昏了头脑，使他们同意谋杀。我开始意识到，我们所有的问题都是源于我们不会使用简洁明了的语言。所以，我决定说话——还有做事——总要极其清楚明了，因为这是我走上正道的唯一途径。因此，我说世上存在着瘟疫和受害者，仅此而已。如果说这话时，我也染上了鼠疫，那么，至少我也不是心甘情愿的。总之，我尽力做一个无罪的杀人犯。你看，我也没什么雄心壮志。”","“Pending that release, I know I have no place in the world of today; once I’d definitely refused to kill, I doomed myself to an exile that can never end.I leave it to others to make history.I know, too, that I’m not qualified to pass judgment on those others.There’s something lacking in my mental make-up, and its lack prevents me from being a rational murderer.So it’s a deficiency, not a superiority.But as things are, I’m willing to be as I am; I’ve learned modesty.All I maintain is that on this earth there are pestilences and there are victims, and it’s up to us, so far as possible, not to join forces with the pestilences.That may sound simple to the point of childishness; I can’t judge if it’s simple, but I know it’s true.You see, I’d heard such quantities of argumerits, which very nearly turned my head, and turned other people’s heads enough to make them approve of murder; and I’d come to realize that all our troubles spring from our failure to use plain, clean-cut language.So I resolved always to speak—and to act—quite clearly, as this was the only way of setting myself on the right track.That’s why I say there are pestilences and there are victims; no more than that.If, by making that statement, I, too, become a carrier of the plague-germ, at least I don’t do it willfully.I try, in short, to be an innocent murderer.You see, I’ve no great ambitions."
"“我认为应该还有第三种人：那就是真正的医生。但事实上，人们遇到的真正的医生并不多，毕竟医生这个职业很辛苦。因此，我决定在任何困境下都站在受害者的一边，以便降低造成的损害。在他们中间，我至少可以设法知道怎样才能达到第三种人的境界，也就是说，怎样获得安宁。”","“I grant we should add a third category: that of the true healers.But it’s a fact one doesn’t come across many of them, and anyhow it must be a hard vocation.That’s why I decided to take, in every predicament, the victims’ side, so as to reduce the damage done.Among them I can at least try to discover how one attains to the third category; in other words, to peace.”"
"这番话说完之后，塔鲁晃动着腿，用脚跟轻轻地敲打着露台。医生沉默了一会儿之后，直了直身子，问塔鲁是否已经想到了该怎样去获得安宁。","Tarrou was swinging his leg, tapping the terrace lightly with his heel, as he concluded.After a short silence the doctor raised himself a little in his chair and asked if Tarrou had an idea of the path to follow for attaining peace."
"“是的，”塔鲁回答说，“通过同情心。”","“Yes,” he replied.“The path of sympathy.”"
"远处传来了两辆救护车的车鸣声。他们刚才听到的时断时续的叫喊声现在都汇集到城市的郊区，靠近那座石头小山的地方。不一会儿，那里传来一声枪响似的声音。接着，四周又恢复了平静。里厄看到灯塔旋转的光束又闪了两次。风势又变强了，从海面上突然吹来的一阵强风使空气都充满了海水的咸味。与此同时，他们也清楚地听到了海浪拍击悬崖而发出的低沉的声音。","Two ambulances were clanging in the distance.The dispersed shouts they had been hearing off and on drew together on the outskirts of the town, near the stony hill, and presently there was a sound like a gunshot.Then silence fell again.Rieux counted two flashes of the revolving light.The breeze freshened and a gust coming from the sea filled the air for a moment with the smell of brine.And at the same time they clearly heard the low sound of waves lapping the foot of the cliffs."
"“归根结底，”塔鲁若无其事地说，“令我感兴趣的是该怎样才能成为圣人。”","“It comes to this,” Tarrou said almost casually; “what interests me is learning how to become a saint.”"
"“但你不信上帝。”","“But you don’t believe in God.”"
"“没错！一个不信上帝之人可以成为圣人吗？——这是个问题，事实上，这是我今天遇到的唯一问题。”","“Exactly!Can one be a saint without God?—that’s the problem, in fact the only problem, I’m up against today.”"
"刚才传来叫喊声的那块地方的上空突然出现一片强光，一阵吵吵嚷嚷的声音顺着风向传进了他们的耳朵。强光不一会儿就消失了，天空只剩下一片淡淡的红光。随后，风暂时停了一会儿，这时他们清楚地听见一阵刺耳的尖叫声和枪击声，接着又听见一群愤怒的人的喧哗声。塔鲁站起身来听，却再也听不到任何声音。　　　　　　　　　","A sudden blaze sprang up above the place the shouts had come from and, stemming the wind-stream, a rumor of many voices came to their ears.The blaze died down almost at once, leaving behind it only a dull red glow.Then in a break of the wind they distinctly heard some strident yells and the discharge of a gun, followed by the roar of an angry crowd.Tarrou stood up and listened, but nothing more could be heard."
"“我想，城门口又发生了小冲突。”","“Another skirmish at the gates, I suppose.”"
"“嗯，已经结束了。”里厄说。","“Well, it’s over now,” Rieux said."
"塔鲁低声说，永远不会结束，而且还会有更多的牺牲者，因为这是事情的必然规律。","Tarrou said in a low voice that it was never over, and there would be more victims, because that was in the order of things."
"“也许吧，”医生回答说，“不过，你知道，我感觉自己更愿与失败者为伍，对圣人倒没有什么感觉。我想，我对英雄主义和圣人之道确实没兴趣。我感兴趣的是做一个真正的人。”","“Perhaps,” the doctor answered.“But, you know, I feel more fellowship with the defeated than with saints.Heroism and sanctity don’t really appeal to me, I imagine.What interests me is being a man.”"
"“对，我们追求的目标是一致的，但我没有你那样的雄心壮志。”","“Yes, we’re both after the same thing, but I’m less ambitious.”"
"里厄以为塔鲁是在开玩笑，所以微笑着回头看了塔鲁一眼。但是，在朦胧夜色的映照下，他看到的却是一张忧伤而严肃的脸。又是一阵风吹来，里厄感觉全身暖洋洋的。塔鲁略微打了个寒战。","Rieux supposed Tarrou was jesting and turned to him with a smile.But, faintly lit by the dim radiance falling from the sky, the face he saw was sad and earnest.There was another gust of wind and Rieux felt it warm on his skin.Tarrou gave himself a little shake."
"“你是否清楚，”他问，“为了友谊，我们现在该做些什么？”","“Do you know,” he said, “what we now should do for friendship’s sake?”"
"“做你想做的任何事情，塔鲁。”","“Anything you like, Tarrou.”"
"“去游泳吧。这是诸多无害享乐之一，即使对一个未来的圣人来说也是可以享受一下的，你同意吧？”","“Go for a swim.It’s one of these harmless pleasures that even a saint-to-be can indulge in, don’t you agree?”"
"里厄又笑了笑，而塔鲁接着又说：“我们有通行证，可以到土堤上去。身陷鼠疫，只为了鼠疫而活着，这真是太愚蠢了。当然，一个真正的人应该为受害者而斗争，但如果除此以外他不再关心其他任何事情，那他进行的斗争又有什么用呢？”","Rieux smiled again, and Tarrou continued: “With our passes, we can get out on the pier.Really, it’s too damn silly living only in and for the plague.Of course, a man should fight for the victims, but if he ceases caring for anything outside that, what’s the use of his fighting?”"
"“对，”里厄说，“我们走吧。”","“Right,” Rieux said.“Let’s go.”"
"不一会儿，他们的汽车在靠近港口的城门处停了下来。月亮已经升起，乳白色的光辉撒向地面，他们的四周都是些斑驳的影子。他们身后是城里鳞次栉比的房屋，从那里吹过来一股温热恶臭的气息，催促着他们向海边走去。一个士兵认真检查了他们递过去的通行证之后，他们穿过了一片堆满了酒桶的露天场地，朝土堤方向走去。这里的空气散发着浓烈的酒气和鱼腥味。他们快到达土堤时，一股碘和海藻的味道告诉他们大海在望，他们也清晰地听到了海浪轻轻拍打大石块的声音。","Some minutes later the car drew up at the harbor gates.The moon had risen and a milk-white radiance, dappled with shadows, lay around them.Behind them rose the town, tier on tier, and from it came warm, fetid breaths of air that urged them toward the sea.After showing their passes to a guard, who inspected them minutely, they crossed some open ground littered with casks, and headed toward the pier.The air here reeked of stale wine and fish.Just before they reached the pier a smell of iodine and seaweed announced the nearness of the sea and they clearly heard the sound of waves breaking gently on the big stone blocks."
"当他们站在土堤上时，展现在他们眼前的是一望无际的大海，海面像厚实的丝绒一样轻轻地此起彼伏，又像动物的皮毛一样柔软光滑。他们坐在一块岩石上，面朝大海。海浪缓慢地起伏着，随着它们平静的呼吸，油亮亮的光在海面上朦胧的夜色中时隐时现。一幅无边无际的夜景呈现在他们的眼前。里厄抚摸着饱经风霜、凹凸不平的岩石表面，心头涌起一种奇异的幸福感。他回头看看塔鲁，瞥见这位朋友的脸上洋溢着同样的幸福，当然这种幸福并不能让人忘却任何事情，甚至不能让人忘却杀戮。他们脱去了衣服，里厄率先跳进了海里。一开始他感觉浑身一阵凉意，而等他重新浮上水面时，却感觉水是温的。他游了几下之后才发现，这天晚上的海水之所以是温的，是因为秋天的大海吸收了海岸在漫漫夏日里积蓄起来的热量。他稳稳地向前游着，双脚拍打着海面，身后留下一道翻滚的泡沫，海水也沿着他的双臂流向他的双腿。他听到“扑通”一声巨响，知道塔鲁也下水了。里厄翻过身来，一动不动地躺在海面上，仰望着点缀着星星与月亮的苍穹。他深吸了一口气。接着，他听到了打水的声音，这声音越来越大，在这寂静的夜晚显得格外响亮。塔鲁就要追上他了，现在他都可以听到塔鲁的呼吸声了。里厄翻过身去，以同样的速度和他的朋友齐头并进地往前游。但塔鲁游得更快，所以里厄只得加快速度才赶得上塔鲁。在短短的几分钟时间里，他们怀着同样的热情，以同样的节奏肩并肩地向前游着，远离尘世，终于摆脱了这座城市和这场鼠疫。里厄先停了下来，接着他们就慢慢地往回游，但期间有一次，一股冰冷的水流出人意料地将他们给困住了。大海向他们发动的这次袭击激发了他们的能量，于是两人更加卖力地游向了终点。","Once they were on the pier they saw the sea spread out before them, a gently heaving expanse of deep-piled velvet, supple and sleek as a creature of the wild.They sat down on a boulder facing the open.Slowly the waters rose and sank, and with their tranquil breathing sudden oily glints formed and flickered over the surface in a haze of broken lights.Before them the darkness stretched out into infinity.Rieux could feel under his hand the gnarled, weather-worn visage of the rocks, and a strange happiness possessed him.Turning to Tarrou, he caught a glimpse on his friend’s face of the same happiness, a happiness that forgot nothing, not even murder.They undressed, and Rieux dived in first.After the first shock of cold had passed and he came back to the surface the water seemed tepid.When he had taken a few strokes he found that the sea was warm that night with the warmth of autumn seas that borrow from the shore the accumulated heat of the long days of summer.The movement of his feet left a foaming wake as he swam steadily ahead, and the water slipped along his arms to close in tightly on his legs.A loud splash told him that Tarrou had dived.Rieux lay on his back and stayed motionless, gazing up at the dome of sky lit by the stars and moon.He drew a deep breath.Then he heard a sound of beaten water, louder and louder, amazingly clear in the hollow silence of the night.Tarrou was coming up with him, he now could hear his breathing.Rieux turned and swam level with his friend, timing his stroke to Tarrou’s.But Tarrou was the stronger swimmer and Rieux had to put on speed to keep up with him.For some minutes they swam side by side, with the same zest, in the same rhythm, isolated from the world, at last free of the town and of the plague.Rieux was the first to stop and they swam back slowly, except at one point, where unexpectedly they found themselves caught in an ice-cold current.Their energy whipped up by this trap the sea had sprung on them, both struck out more vigorously."
"他们穿上衣服，开始往回走。两个人一言不发，但他们都很清楚，他们已是一对同心同德的朋友，而且他们都会珍藏今晚的这段回忆。当他们看到这座疫城的哨兵时，里厄猜想塔鲁这时的想法一定和他一样：鼠疫已经让他们稍稍休息了一会儿，这很好，但现在他们又该奋力拼搏了。","They dressed and started back.Neither had said a word, but they were conscious of being perfectly at one, and the memory of this night would be cherished by them both.When they caught sight of the plague watchman, Rieux guessed that Tarrou, like himself, was thinking that the disease had given them a respite, and this was good, but now they must set their shoulders to the wheel again."
"第二十四章","Chapter 24"
"是的，鼠疫确实只是稍稍放松了一会儿，但现在他们又该奋力拼搏了。在整个十二月份，鼠疫又在市民们的胸口闷烧起来，使火葬场的焚尸炉烧得更旺了，也使隔离营里挤满了更多的被遗弃之人。总之，它从未停下它所特有的虽不平稳却很坚定的步伐。当局曾乐观地估计，冬天的来临可以刹住鼠疫的发展势头，但鼠疫在整个严寒的初冬丝毫未曾止步。人们只得继续等待，而等了太久之后也就不再等下去了，所有市民的生活似乎也变得没什么奔头了。","Yes, the plague gave short shrift indeed, and they must set their shoulders to the wheel again.Throughout December it smoldered in the chests of our townsfolk, fed the fires in the crematorium, and peopled the camps with human jetsam.In short, it never ceased progressing with its characteristically jerky but unfaltering stride.The authorities had optimistically reckoned on the coming of winter to halt its progress, but it lasted through the first cold spells without the least remission.So the only thing for us to do was to go on waiting, and since after a too long waiting one gives up waiting, the whole town lived as if it had no future."
"对里厄医生来说，那晚他所享受的短暂的安宁与友谊的时刻也已经是一去不复返了。城里又开设了一家医院，所以他整日只忙着与病人打交道。不过，虽然肺鼠疫患者与日俱增，他却注意到了这个时期的一个变化，病人们似乎都在以自己的方式来支持他的工作。他们不再像鼠疫初期时那样沮丧或疯狂，相反，他们看起来已经更清楚地认识到自己的利益所在，因而会主动提一些对自己最有好处的要求。他们不断地吵着要喝水，还坚持要人们为他们尽量做好保暖工作。尽管里厄的工作还是像以前一样累人，但他不再感到自己是在孤军作战了，病人们都很合作。接近十二月底时，仍在接受隔离的奥顿先生给里厄寄来了一封信。这位地方治安官说他接受隔离检疫的时间早已到期，不幸的是，隔离营秘书处似乎把他的入营时间给登记错了，一定是因为这个错误，他还被关在那里。他妻子不久前被解除了隔离，她去省府抗议过，却在那里碰了钉子，他们回复说，秘书处绝不会出差错。里厄请朗贝尔出面去处理这件事，而在几天之后，奥顿先生就来拜访里厄了。实际上，果真是出了差错，所以里厄显得有点儿愤怒。但业已消瘦的奥顿先生举起了一只软弱无力的手，不以为然地摆了摆，他字斟句酌地说，大家都可能会犯错。医生心想情况一定有了些变化。","As for Dr. Rieux, that brief hour of peace and friendship which had been granted him was not, and could not be, repeated.Yet another hospital had been opened, and his only converse was with his patients.However, he noticed a change at this stage of the epidemic, now that the plague was assuming more and more the pneumonic form; the patients seemed, after their fashion, to be seconding the doctor.Instead of giving way to the prostration or the frenzies of the early period, they appeared to have a clearer idea of where their interests lay and on their own initiative asked for what might be most beneficial.Thus they were always clamoring for something to drink and insisted on being kept as warm as possible.And though the demands on him were as exhausting as before, Rieux no longer had the impression of putting up a solitary fight; the patients were cooperating.Toward the end of December he received a letter from M. Othon, who was still in quarantine.The magistrate stated that his quarantine period was over; unfortunately the date of his admission to camp seemed to have been mislaid by the secretariat, and if he was still detained it was certainly due to a mistake.His wife, recently released from quarantine, had gone to the Prefect’s office to protest and had been rudely treated; they had told her that the office never made mistakes.Rieux asked Rambert to look into the matter, and a few days later M. Othon called on him.There had, in fact, been a mistake, and Rieux showed some indignation.But M. Othon, who had grown thinner, raised a limp, deprecating hand; weighing his words, he said that everyone could make mistakes.And the doctor thought to himself that decidedly something had changed."
"“奥顿先生，你现在有什么打算？”里厄问，“我想，有一大堆工作正等着你去处理呢。”","“What will you do now, Monsieur Othon?” Rieux asked.“I suppose you have a pile of work awaiting you.”"
"“嗯，事实上，我想请假。”","“Well, as a matter of fact, I’m putting in for some leave.”"
"“我很理解。你需要休息。”","“I quite understand.You need a rest.”"
"“不是这个意思。我是想回隔离营去。”","“It’s not that.I want to go back to the camp.”"
"里厄不敢相信自己的耳朵。“可你刚从隔离营出来呀！”","Rieux couldn’t believe his ears.“But you’ve only just come out of it!”"
"“恐怕我刚才没有说明白。有人告诉我，那个隔离营里有一些来自政府当局的志愿管理人员。”地方治安官的圆眼睛转了一下，并且用手把竖起来的一撮头发弄弄平。“你看，这样我就有事可做了。而且——我知道这可能听起来很可笑，但在那里我才会感觉我的小男孩不曾离我而去。”","“I’m afraid I did not make myself clear.I’m told there are some voluntary workers from government offices in that camp.”The magistrate rolled his round eyes a little and tried to smooth down a tuft of hair.“It would keep me busy, you see.And also—I know it may sound absurd, but I’d feel less separated from my little boy.”"
"里厄注视着他。奥顿先生那双严厉而又缺乏表情的眼睛里是否掠过一丝温柔？是的，他已是泪眼朦胧，眼里也失去了那种坚毅的神采。","Rieux stared at him.Could it be that a sudden gentleness showed in those hard, inexpressive eyes?Yes, they had grown misted, lost their steely glitter."
"“当然了，”里厄说，“既然你想去，那我会为你办妥此事的。”","“Certainly,” Rieux said.“Since that’s your wish, I’ll fix it up for you.”"
"医生信守了他的诺言，直到圣诞节为止，这座疫城里的生活一直都是老样子。塔鲁继续有条不紊地应对着各种问题。朗贝尔向医生透露，在那两位年轻哨兵的默许之下，他和他妻子之间时常有一些书信往来。他建议里厄也利用一下这个秘密渠道，医生同意了。好几个月以来，里厄还是第一次坐下来写信。他发现写信也很费力，似乎他在提笔写一种已被自己遗忘的语言。这封信发出去了。但回信却迟迟不见踪影。对于科塔尔来说，他的生意正蒸蒸日上，他的小规模、有些见不得人的投机买卖令他大发横财。但格朗的情况正相反，他似乎在这个圣诞节期间过得很不好。","The doctor kept his word; and the life of the plague-ridden town resumed its course until Christmas.Tarrou continued to bring his quiet efficiency to bear on every problem.Rambert confided in the doctor that, with the connivance of the two young guards, he was sending letters to his wife and now and then receiving an answer.He suggested to Rieux that he should avail himself of this clandestine channel, and Rieux agreed to do so.For the first time for many months he sat down to write a letter.He found it a laborious business, as if he were manipulating a language that he had forgotten.The letter was dispatched.The reply was slow in coming.As for Cottard, he was prospering, making money hand over fist in small, somewhat shady transactions.With Grand, however, it was otherwise; the Christmas season did not seem to agree with him."
"事实上，这一年的圣诞节迥异于往年，这个圣诞节略带些地狱的味道，而没有天国的喜庆气氛。商铺里空空如也、黑灯瞎火的，糖果店橱窗里摆着些假巧克力或空盒子，电车满载着无精打采、萎靡不振的乘客——所有的这一切没有一点儿昔日圣诞节的影子。以往，所有市民，无论是富人还是穷人，全都沉浸在节日的欢乐之中；如今，只有少数有钱人躲在肮脏昏暗的门面后堂或私宅里羞愧、孤独地狂欢作乐。教堂里充斥着祈祷声，而不是圣诞颂歌。可以看到几个不谙世事的孩子在寒冷而凄凉的街道上奔跑着。但没人敢上前向这些孩子表示欢迎——以前，上帝会派圣诞老人带来礼物，他虽与人类的痛苦同样古老，却与年轻人的希望一样朝气勃勃。大家的心里只留下一个很古老、很暗淡的希望，这就是一种坚持活下去的顽强意志，它使人们不至于自暴自弃而甘愿死去。","Indeed, Christmas that year had none of its old-time associations; it smacked of hell rather than of heaven.Empty, unlighted shops, dummy chocolates or empty boxes in the confectioners’ windows, streetcars laden with listless, dispirited passengers—all was as unlike previous Christmastides as it well could be.In the past all the townspeople, rich and poor alike, indulged in seasonable festivity; now only a privileged few, those with money to burn, could do so, and they caroused in shamefast solitude in a dingy back shop or a private room.In the churches there were more supplications than carols.You saw a few children, too young to realize what threatened them, playing in the frosty, cheerless streets.But no one dared to bid them welcome——in the God of former days, bringer of gifts, and old as human sorrow, yet new as the hopes of youth.There was no room in any heart but for a very old, gray hope, that hope which keeps men from letting themselves drift into death and is nothing but a dogged will to live."
"圣诞节前夜，格朗没有像往常一样到医生那去。里厄有点儿担心，因此圣诞节一清早就到他家去，却没有见到他。医生就请朋友们四处去找他。十一点左右，朗贝尔来到医院，说他远远看到格朗在街上漫无目的地游荡，“看起来怪怪的”。不幸的是，格朗突然就不见了踪影。于是，塔鲁和医生开车四处寻找格朗。","Grand had failed to show up as usual on the previous evening.Feeling somewhat anxious, Rieux called at his place early in the morning, but he wasn’t at home.His friends were asked to keep a lookout for him.At about eleven Rambert came to the hospital with the news that he’d had a distant glimpse of Grand, who seemed to be wandering aimlessly, “looking very queer.”Unfortunately he had lost sight of him almost at once.Tarrou and the doctor set out in the car to hunt for Grand."
"正午时，里厄下了车，走进凛冽的寒风中。他刚刚看到格朗站在不远处，他的脸紧紧贴在一个橱窗上，橱窗里摆满了做工粗糙的木制玩具。眼泪像断了线的珍珠似的在这位老人的脸上流淌着，这令医生也感到揪心，因为他懂得这些泪水的含义，他感觉自己同情的眼泪夺眶而出。他的眼前呈现出多年以前的那幕场景——年轻的格朗站在另一个橱窗前，就像这个为圣诞节装扮一新的橱窗一样，而珍妮突然转过身，含情脉脉地对他说她很开心。他可以想象，穿过岁月的薄雾，拂去内心深深的绝望，珍妮那年轻的声音一定又在格朗的耳畔不断回响。他也知道，这位老人流着泪在想些什么，而他自己也有同样的想法：没有爱的世界是个死气沉沉的世界，而且，总会有这么一个时刻，人们厌倦了监狱、工作、忠于职守等等，一心只想着昔日爱人的模样，回味着爱情的温暖与奇妙。","At noon Rieux stepped out of his car into the frozen air; he had just caught sight of Grand some distance away, his face glued to a shop-window full of crudely carved wooden toys.Tears were steadily flowing down the old fellow’s cheeks, and they wrung the doctor’s heart, for he could understand them, and he felt his own tears welling up in sympathy.A picture rose before him of that scene of long ago—the youngster standing in front of another shop-window, like this one dressed for Christmas, and Jeanne turning toward him in a sudden access of emotion and saying how happy she was.He could guess that through the mists of the past years, from the depth of his fond despair, Jeanne’s young voice was rising, echoing in Grand’s ears.And he knew, also, what the old man was thinking as his tears flowed, and he, Rieux, thought it too: that a loveless world is a dead world, and always there comes an hour when one is weary of prisons, of one’s work, and of devotion to duty, and all one craves for is a loved face, the warmth and wonder of a loving heart."
"格朗看到了橱窗上医生的影子。于是他啜泣着转过身来，斜靠在橱窗上，看着医生朝他走过去。","Grand saw the doctor’s reflection in the window.Still weeping, he turned and, leaning against the shop-front, watched Rieux approach."
"“噢，医生，医生！”他哽咽着说不出话来。","“Oh, doctor, doctor!”He could say no more."
"里厄也说不出话来，他表示理解地轻轻地点了点头。此时此刻，他对格朗的悲伤感同身受，他的心里还洋溢着一种强烈的愤慨，任何人在看到大家受苦时都会产生这样的情感。","Rieux, too, couldn’t speak; he made a vague, understanding gesture.At this moment he suffered with Grand’s sorrow, and what filled his breast was the passionate indignation we feel when confronted by the anguish all men share."
"“唉，格朗。”他低声说。","“Yes, Grand,” he murmured."
"“噢，要是我能找个时间给她写封信该多好呀！让她知道……让她无怨无悔快乐地生活下去！”里厄几乎有些粗暴地拽着格朗的胳膊往前走。格朗毫不抗拒地任由医生拽着走，嘴里却仍在喃喃自语地说些只言片语。","“Oh, if only I could have time to write to her!To let her know...and to let her be happy without remorse!”Almost roughly Rieux took Grand’s arm and drew him forward.Grand did not resist and went on muttering broken phrases."
"“太久了！这实在是拖得太久了。人们总想着一切都听天由命，而有时却是迫不得已。噢，医生，我知道我看起来很平静，与他人没什么两样。但我一直都在努力扛着，只为了——只为了保持常态。而现在——唉，我再也扛不住了。”","“Too long!It’s lasted too long.All the time one’s wanting to let oneself go, and then one day one has to.Oh, doctor, I know I look a quiet sort, just like anybody else.But it’s always been a terrible effort only to be—just normal.And now—well, even that’s too much for me.”"
"他突然停了下来。他浑身都在剧烈地颤抖着，眼睛红红的。里厄拉起他的手，他的手很烫。","He stopped dead.He was trembling violently, his eyes were fever-bright.Rieux took his hand; it was burning hot."
"“你必须回去了。”","“You must go home.”"
"但格朗挣脱了医生的手，开始往前跑。只跑了几步，他就停了下来，张开双臂，身子前后摇摆起来。他感到天旋地转，一头倒在了人行道上，脸上满是泪痕，而且仍在泪流不止。有些行人突然停下了脚步，远远地张望着，却不敢再上前一步。里厄只得把老人抱上了车。","But Grand wrenched himself free and started running.After a few steps he halted and stretched out his arms, swaying to and fro.Then he spun round on himself and fell flat on the pavement, his face stained with the tears that went on flowing.Some people who were approaching stopped abruptly and watched the scene from a little way off, not daring to come nearer.Rieux had to carry the old man to the car."
"格朗躺在床上，喘着粗气，他的肺部受到了感染。里厄默默思考着。这位老人没有任何家人。那又有什么必要将他送进隔离病房呢？自己和塔鲁可以来照料他。","Grand lay in bed, gasping for breath; his lungs were congested.Rieux pondered.The old fellow hadn’t any family.What would be the point of having him evacuated?He and Tarrou could look after him."
"格朗的头深深地埋在枕头里，脸色发青，眼睛暗淡无光。他似乎正在凝视壁炉里勉强燃起的火焰，那是塔鲁用一只老木箱的碎片点着的。“我感觉很糟。”他低声说。他每次开口试着说话，听起来都像是从他那燃烧的肺部发出的一种奇怪的噼啪声。里厄叫他不要再说话了，并说他一定会康复的。病人的嘴角露出一种奇怪的笑容，他那憔悴的脸上也拂过一种略带诙谐的表情。“要是我能康复，医生——我要向你脱帽致敬！”不一会儿，他就陷入了极度衰竭状态。","Grand’s head was buried in the pillow, his cheeks were a greenish gray, his eyes had gone dull, opaque.He seemed to be gazing fixedly at the scanty fire Tarrou was kindling with the remains of an old packing-case.“I’m in a bad way,” he muttered.A queer crackling sound came from his flame-seared lungs whenever he tried to speak.Rieux told him not to talk and promised to come back.The sick man’s lips parted in a curious smile, and a look of humorous complicity flickered across the haggard face.“If I pull through, doctor—hats off!”A moment later he sank into extreme prostration."
"几个小时后，当里厄和塔鲁再来看他时，发现他正坐在床上，脸被蔓延的病情烧得通红，里厄也为这迅速变化感到震惊。但是，他看起来比先前更清醒了，一见面就叫他们去把他保存在抽屉里的那份手稿取来给他。塔鲁将手稿递给他之后，他看也不看就把它贴在胸口，然后又伸手把它递给医生，示意医生看看。这份手稿大约有五十页。","Visiting him again some hours later, they found him half sitting up in bed, and Rieux was horrified by the rapid change that had come over his face, ravaged by the fires of the disease consuming him.However, he seemed more lucid and almost immediately asked them to get his manuscript from the drawer where he always kept it.When Tarrou handed him the sheets, he pressed them to his chest without looking at them, then held them out to the doctor, indicating by a gesture that he was to read them.There were some fifty pages of manuscript."
"里厄浏览了一下手稿，发现这叠稿纸上反反复复地写着同一个句子，只是文字上作了些增删、修改或润色。五月、女骑士、布洛涅林阴大道，这些词反复出现，只是句式不断变换。此外，稿纸上还作了注释，有些还很冗长，并且也罗列了一些不同的句式表达。但在最后一张稿纸的下端却清晰而认真地写着：“我亲爱的珍妮，今天是圣诞节……”就只有这一句话。在这句话上面，用铜版刻的字体写着的那个句子，是那句名句的最新版本。“请念念吧。”格朗小声说。于是里厄念道：","Glancing through them, Rieux saw that the bulk of the writing consisted of the same sentence written again and again with small variants, simplifications or elaborations.Persistently the month of May, the lady on horseback, the avenues of the Bois recurred, regrouped in different patterns.There were, besides, explanatory notes, some exceedingly long, and lists of alternatives.But at the foot of the last page was written in a studiously clear hand: “My dearest Jeanne, Today is Christmas Day and...”Eight words only.Above it, in copperplate script, was the latest version of the famous phrase.“Read it,” Grand whispered.And Rieux read: "
"“在五月的一个美丽的清晨，人们可以看到一位苗条的女骑士骑着一匹漂亮的枣骝雌马在花丛中穿过布洛涅林阴大道……”","“One fine morning in May, a slim young horsewoman might have been seen riding a glossy sorrel mare along the avenues of the Bois, among the flowers....”"
"“是该这样写吗？”老人声音颤抖着问。里厄忍住没有抬眼看他，于是他在床上辗转反侧起来。“对，我知道。我知道你在想什么。‘美丽’这个词用得不确切。应该用——”","“Is that it?”There was a feverish quaver in the old voice.Rieux refrained from looking at him, and he began to toss about in the bed.“Yes, I know.I know what you’re thinking.‘Fine’ isn’t the word.It’s—” "
"里厄握住了格朗放在被窝里的那只手。","Rieux clasped his hand under the coverlet."
"“算了，医生。为时已晚了——没时间了……”他艰难地喘着气，突然大声尖叫着：“烧了它！”","“No, doctor.It’s too late—no time...”His breast heaved painfully, then suddenly he said in a loud, shrill voice: “Burn it!”"
"医生犹豫着没动，但格朗用一种异常严厉而痛苦的语气重复了他的命令，里厄也只好向壁炉走去，将这些稿纸扔进快要熄灭的炉火里。炉火又燃烧了起来，突然发出一片光芒，屋子里有一丝暖意，但转瞬即逝。当医生回到格朗的床边时，发现他已背过身去，他的脸几乎贴着墙。给格朗注射了血清之后，里厄轻声对塔鲁说，格朗熬不过当晚，于是塔鲁主动提出留下来守着病人。医生同意了。","The doctor hesitated, but Grand repeated his injunction in so violent a tone and with such agony in his voice that Rieux walked across to the fireplace and dropped the sheets on the dying fire.It blazed up, and there was a sudden flood of light, a fleeting warmth, in the room.When the doctor came back to the bed, Grand had his back turned, his face almost touching the wall.After injecting the serum Rieux whispered to his friend that Grand wouldn’t last the night, and Tarrou volunteered to stay with him.The doctor approved."
"一整晚，里厄的脑海里都萦绕着格朗将要死去这件事。但第二天早上他却发现格朗正坐在床上和塔鲁聊天。格朗的体温已恢复正常，只不过还有些全身乏力的症状。","All night Rieux was haunted by the idea of Grand’s death.But next morning he found his patient sitting up in bed, talking to Tarrou.His temperature was down to normal and there were no symptoms other than a generalized prostration."
"“对了，医生，”格朗说，“我的确操之过急了。但我会重写的。你等着瞧吧，我会记住每个词。”","“Yes, doctor,” Grand said.“I was overhasty.But I’ll make another start.You’ll see, I can remember every word.”"
"里厄半信半疑地看着塔鲁。“我们是得等等看。”他说。","Rieux looked at Tarrou dubiously.“We must wait,” he said."
"不过，到了正午，病情没什么变化。到了傍晚，已经可以认为格朗已脱离了危险。里厄对这种“起死回生”的现象感到很困惑。","But at noon there was no change.By nightfall Grand could be considered out of danger.Rieux was completely baffled by this “resurrection.”"
"接下来他还遇到了一些奇怪的事。大约在同一时期，有位女孩被送进了医院，经过诊断，里厄认为她已病入膏肓，于是叫人立即将她送到隔离病房去。她神志不清，出现了肺鼠疫的一切症状。但是，到了第二天，她的体温却下降了。医生以为这与格朗的病情一样，都是体温在早晨出现了暂时下降，根据经验判断，这是个坏兆头。","Other surprises were in store for him.About the same time there was brought to the hospital a girl whose case Rieux diagnosed as hopeless, and he had her sent immediately to the isolation ward.She was delirious’ and had all the symptoms of pneumonic plague.Next morning, however, the temperature had fallen.As in Grand’s case the doctor assumed this was the ordinary morning fall that his experience had taught him to regard as a bad sign."
"但到了正午，她的体温并没有上升，而到了晚上，体温也只上升了几度而已。第二天早上，体温已恢复正常。女孩尽管还很虚弱，但呼吸已变得顺畅了。里厄对塔鲁说，这女孩的康复“很反常！”但在接下来的一个星期的时间里，里厄又发现了四起类似的病例。周末，里厄和塔鲁去看望那位老气喘病人时，老人感到很兴奋。","But at noon her temperature still showed no rise and at night it went up only a few degrees.Next morning it was down to normal.Though very exhausted, the girl was breathing freely.Rieux remarked to Tarrou that her recovery was “against all the rules!”But in the course of the next week four similar cases came to his notice.The old asthma patient was bubbling over with excitement when Rieux and Tarrou visited him at the end of the week."
"“这简直令人难以置信！它们又跑出来了。”他说。","“Would you ever have believed it!They’re coming out again,” he said."
"“什么家伙跑出来了？”","“Who?”"
"“嗨，老鼠呗！”","“Why, the rats!”"
"自从四月以来，这座城里已没了任何老鼠的踪影，无论是活的还是死的。","Not one dead or living rat had been seen in the town since April."
"“这是否意味着一切又要重新开始了？”塔鲁问里厄。","“Does that mean it’s starting all over again?” Tarrou asked Rieux."
"老人兴奋地搓着手。","The old man was rubbing his hands."
"“医生，看看它们奔跑的样子吧！这真是件难得的乐事呀！”","“You should see ’em running, doctor!It’s a treat, it is!”"
"老人自己看见过两只老鼠从那邻街的大门溜进了他家，而一些邻居也告诉过他，他们在自家的地下室里也发现了老鼠。在一些房子里，人们又重新听到木制品后传来一度熟悉的老鼠的骚动声。里厄万分期待每周一公布的死亡数字。数字显示，死亡人数下降了。","He himself had seen two rats slipping into the house by the street door, and some neighbors, too, had told him they’d seen rats in their basements.In some houses people had heard those, once familiar scratchings and rustlings behind the woodwork.Rieux awaited with much interest the mortality figures that were announced every Monday.They showed a decrease."
"第五部","PART V "
"第二十五章","Chapter 25"
"尽管疫情突然减弱令市民们既感到意外又感到兴奋，但他们也不敢高兴得过早。尽管他们越来越希望能彻底摆脱鼠疫的折磨，但几个月以来的可怕遭遇已经让他们学会了谨慎，也让他们越来越不指望鼠疫能马上结束。尽管如此，大家仍然在谈论疫情的这一新情况，内心也开始产生了一种虽未明说却仍诚挚的渴望。其他一切都不重要；虽然每天还有人死去，但更重要的是这个难以置信的事实：每周的死亡总数呈下降趋势。有迹象表明，市民们在暗中期待着能重新回到美好的健康时代，因为尽管他们没有公开表明自己的希望，但现在都开始谈论——当然，说话时刻意带着一种无所谓的口气——鼠疫结束后要怎样去安排他们的新生活。","Though this sudden setback of the plague was as welcome as it was unlooked-for, our townsfolk were in no hurry to jubilate.While intensifying their desire to be set free, the terrible months they had lived through had taught them prudence, and they had come to count less and less on a speedy end of the epidemic.All the same, this new development was the talk of the town, and people began to nurse hopes none the less heartfelt for being unavowed.All else took a back place; that daily there were new victims counted for little beside that staggering fact: the weekly total showed a decrease.One of the signs that a return to the golden age of health was secretly awaited was that our fellow citizens, careful though they were not to voice their hope, now began to talk—in, it is true, a carefully detached tone—of the new order of life that would set in after the plague."
"大家一致认为，恢复往日舒适的生活环境不是一朝一夕的事情；破坏起来容易，重建起来难。但是，人们认为食物供应一定会稍有改善，这将缓解目前每个家庭最为操心的问题。但事实上，这些小小的愿望里却蕴藏着一些荒诞的奢望，而每每有人意识到这一点，他们就会急忙补充说，无论人们有多乐观，都不能指望鼠疫会一夜之间就结束了。","All agreed that the amenities of the past couldn’t be restored at once; destruction is an easier, speedier process than reconstruction.However, it was thought that a slight improvement in the food-supply could safely be counted on, and this would relieve what was just now the acutest worry of every household.But in reality behind these mild aspirations lurked wild, extravagant hopes, and often one of us, becoming aware of this, would hastily add that, even on the rosiest view, you couldn’t expect the plague to stop from one day to another."
"果然，鼠疫没有“一夜之间”就结束了，但疫情减缓的速度还是比人们合理预想的要快些。一月份的第一个星期出现了罕见的持续寒冷天气，冷空气似乎凝结在城市上空。但天空却呈现出从未有过的蔚蓝，连日来，这座城市沐浴在清冷却灿烂的阳光之中，而鼠疫在这不再结霜的空气里也失去了威力，一连三周公布的死亡人数都大大减少了。因此，在较短的一段时间里，鼠疫几乎丧失了它好几个月积蓄起来的全部力量。它放过了那些看似难逃厄运的受害者，如格朗和送到里厄那儿的女孩；它在一些地区猖獗两三天，同时却在另一些地区销声匿迹；周一它夺去了更多病人的生命，而到了周三，它却让全部病人几乎都逃脱了——总之，它时而来势汹汹，时而又萎靡不振——所有这一切都让人们觉得，它由于疲惫和厌倦而渐渐委顿下来，它以前拥有的那张自制而又无情、几乎百发百中的王牌也渐渐失去了威力。卡斯特尔的血清以前一直没什么疗效，现在却突然屡屡成功了。事实上，医生们以前试用过却未曾奏效的各种疗法现在似乎全都灵验了起来。鼠疫像是被逼入了死角，那些以前用来抵抗它的迟钝的武器似乎因为它突然的衰弱而变得锋利起来。只不过，鼠疫偶尔又会振作起来，对三四个有望康复的病人施以盲目而致命的打击——这少数几人真是够倒霉的，在这最充满希望的时刻倒被鼠疫夺去了生命。本已离开隔离营的地方治安官奥顿就是这种情况，塔鲁说奥顿先生“运气不佳”，不知他指的是奥顿的死，还是指奥顿的一生。但是，总的来说，疫病正在全线撤退。官方公报先是流露出一丝隐隐约约、缺乏热情的希望，现在却已肯定了大家的这种想法：胜利在望，鼠疫正在放弃它的阵地。但是，这是否称得上是个胜利，的确还很难说。只能说，这鼠疫似乎来也匆匆去也匆匆，令人费解。人们对付它的策略没有改变，但昨天还是行之无效，今日却似乎成效显著。的确，人们的主要印象是：鼠疫在达到目标后自行撤退了，也可以说，它的目的已经实现了。","Actually, while the epidemic did not stop “from one day to another,” it declined more rapidly than we could reasonably have expected.With the first week of January an unusually persistent spell of very cold weather settled in and seemed to crystallize above the town.Yet never before had the sky been so blue; day after day its icy radiance flooded the town with brilliant light, and in the frost-cleansed air the epidemic seemed to lose its virulence, and in each of three consecutive weeks a big drop in the death-roll was announced.Thus over a relatively brief period the disease lost practically all the gains piled up over many months.Its setbacks with seemingly predestined victims, like Grand and Rieux’s girl patient, its bursts of activity for two or three days in some districts synchronizing with its total disappearance from others, its new practice of multiplying its victims on, say, a Monday, and on Wednesday letting almost all escape—in short, its accesses of violence followed by spells of complete inactivity—all these gave an impression that its energy was flagging, out of exhaustion and exasperation, and it was losing, with its self-command, the ruthless, almost mathematical efficiency that had been its trump card hitherto.Of a sudden Castel’s anti-plague injections scored frequent successes, denied it until now.Indeed, all the treatments the doctors had tentatively employed, without definite results, now seemed almost uniformly efficacious.It was as if the plague had .been hounded down and cornered, and its sudden weakness lent new strength to the blunted weapons so far used against it.Only at rare moments did the disease brace itself and make as it were a blind and fatal leap at three or four patients whose recovery had been expected—a truly ill-starred few, killed off when hope ran highest.Such was the case of M. Othon, the magistrate, evacuated from the quarantine camp; Tarrou said of him that “he’d had no luck,” but one couldn’t tell if he had in mind the life or the death of M. Othon.But, generally speaking, the epidemic was in retreat all along the line; the official communiques, which had at first encouraged no more than shadowy, half-hearted hopes, now confirmed the popular belief that the victory was won and the enemy abandoning his positions.Really, however, it is doubtful if this could be called a victory.All that could be said was that the disease seemed to be leaving as unaccountably as it had come.Our strategy had not changed, but whereas yesterday it had obviously failed, today it seemed triumphant.Indeed, one’s chief impression was that the epidemic had called a retreat after reaching all its objectives; it had, so to speak, achieved its purpose."
"但是，城里似乎并没有任何变化。白天，大街上还是静悄悄的，傍晚时则像往常一样挤满了穿着大衣、围着围巾的人。咖啡馆和电影院还是跟以往一样生意兴隆。但只要认真观察一下就可以发现，人们的表情更放松了，偶尔还会露出笑容。这使人清楚地意识到，自从鼠疫爆发之日起到现在，在公众场合一直都没见人笑过。事实上，几个月来把这座城市捂得严严实实、透不过气来的帷幕现在已出现了一个裂口，而且每周一人们一打开收音机就会发现这个裂口正在扩大，很快人们就可以自由呼吸了。但这至多就是个消极安慰罢了，对人们的生活并未产生直接影响。不过，要是一个月前有人听说一列火车已经出站，或者一艘轮船已经驶入港口，或者汽车将重新获准在大街上行驶等消息，他一定会露出怀疑的表情，而到了一月中旬，要是发布上述消息，人们一点儿都不会感到惊讶了。这种变化当然是微不足道的。不过，无论这种变化多么微妙，它已说明市民们在希望的道路上已经迈出了一大步。而且，我们的确可以说，一旦人们心头燃起了一丝希望，鼠疫横行的日子也就结束了。","Nevertheless, it seemed as if nothing had changed in the town.Silent as ever by day, the streets filled up at nightfall with the usual crowds of people, now wearing overcoats and scarves.Cafes and picture-houses did as much business as before.But on a closer view you might notice that people looked less strained, and they occasionally smiled.And this brought home the fact that since the outbreak of plague no one had hitherto been seen to smile in public.The truth was that for many months the town had been stifling under an airless shroud, in which a rent had now been made, and every Monday when he turned on the radio, each of us learned that the rift was widening; soon he would be able to breathe freely.It was at best a negative solace, with no immediate impact on men’s lives.Still, had anyone been told a month earlier that a train had just left or a boat put in, or that cars were to be allowed on the streets again, the news would have been received with looks of incredulity; whereas in mid-January an announcement of this kind would have caused no surprise.The change, no doubt, was slight.Yet, however slight, it proved what a vast forward stride our townsfolk had made in the way of hope.And indeed it could be said that once the faintest stirring of hope became possible, the dominion of the plague was ended."
"但必须承认的是，在这个月，市民们的反应各不相同，甚至说得上是大相径庭。更确切地说，有些人极度乐观，有些人极度沮丧。因此，尽管此时的统计数字最为令人振奋，却又出现了几起试图逃跑的奇怪事件。这令当局感到意外，而守卫城门的哨兵们自然也很吃惊——因为大多数“逃跑者”都成功脱逃了。但是，经过一番深入调查，人们就会发现，这个时候试图逃跑的人是受到一些极易理解的情绪所驱使的。对一些逃跑的人来说，鼠疫已经在他们心里深深地播下了怀疑的种子，怀疑成了他们的第二天性，他们已经不报任何形式的希望了。所以，即使鼠疫已经自生自灭，他们依然遵照鼠疫时期的准则来生活。总之，他们是落伍之人。而另一些人——主要是那些在这以前一直被迫与亲人分离的人——经过了这几个月的忍耐和消沉之后，日益强烈的渴望之风吹走了他们的耐心，也吹走了他们的自制力。他们一想到重逢之日在即，自己却可能先行死去，再也见不到亲人，而长期的煎熬也得不到任何补偿，他们就惴惴不安起来。所以，尽管他们顽强地经受住了这几个月来严酷的考验，但希望的曙光却足以摧毁恐惧和绝望所不能摧毁的东西。他们等不及鼠疫结束，而是带着狂乱的情绪，想要冲到鼠疫前面去。","It must, however, be admitted that our fellow citizens’ reactions during that month were diverse to the point of incoherence.More precisely, they fluctuated between high optimism and extreme depression.Hence the odd circumstance that several more attempts to escape took place at the very moment when the statistics were most encouraging.This took the authorities by surprise, and, apparently, the sentries too—since most of the “escapists” brought it off.But, looking into it, one saw that people who tried to escape at this time were prompted by quite understandable motives.Some of them plague had imbued with a skepticism so thorough that it was now a second nature; they had become allergic to hope in any form.Thus even when the plague had run its course, they went on living by its standards.They were, in short, behind the times.In the case of others—chiefly those who had been living until now in forced separation from those they loved—the rising wind of hope, after all these months of durance and depression, had fanned impatience to a blaze and swept away their self-control.They were seized with a sort of panic at the thought that they might die so near the goal and never see again the ones they loved, and their long privation have no recompense.Thus, though for weary months and months they had endured their long ordeal with dogged perseverance, the first thrill of hope had been enough to shatter what fear and hopelessness had failed to impair.And in the frenzy of their haste they tried to outstrip the plague, incapable of keeping pace with it up to the end."
"与此同时，也出现了越来越多的乐观迹象。比如说，物价已显著下降了。这种下降从纯经济学的角度是无法解释的。我们的困难并没有减少，城门口还是被严格把守，食物供应局面一点儿也没有得到改善。因此，这纯粹是一种心理反应——似乎鼠疫的减弱必然引起各个领域的连锁反应一样。受乐观情绪感染的还有那些以前一直习惯于集体生活，却因鼠疫而被迫分开生活的人。城里的两个修道院重新开放了，那里的集体生活也因此得以恢复。军人们也重新搬回到那些没被征用的营房里去，恢复了以往那种部队生活。这些事情虽小，却意义重大。","Meanwhile, there were various symptoms of the growing optimism.Prices, for instance, fell sharply.This fall was unaccountable from the purely economic viewpoint.Our difficulties were as great as ever, the gates were kept rigorously closed, and the food situation was far from showing any improvement.Thus it was a purely psychological reaction—as if the dwindling of the plague must have repercussions in all fields.Others to profit by the spread of optimism were those who used to live in groups and had been forced to live apart.The two convents reopened and their communal life was resumed.The troops, too, were regrouped in such barracks as had not been requisitioned, and settled down to the garrison life of the past.Minor details, but significant."
"这种秘而不宣却在全城涌动的兴奋状态一直持续到1月25日，这个星期的死亡总数显著下降。在征求了医学委员会的意见之后，当局宣布鼠疫可以被视为已经抑制住了。当然，公报继续补充说，为了谨慎起见——市民们一定会赞同这一点——省府决定，城门还要再关闭两周，预防措施则还要再继续执行一个月。在这期间，一发现鼠疫有死灰复燃的迹象，“就必须严格执行现有命令，如有必要，将延长执行期限，直至形势好转”。但是，大家一致认为，这些补充文字只是些官方措辞而已，于是，1月25日这晚，全城一片欢腾。为了配合大家的庆祝活动，省长下令恢复过去的街道照明。市民们成群结队地在灯火辉煌的大街上游行庆祝，大家笑呀，唱呀，欢声一片。当然，也有些屋子依然紧闭着百叶窗，呆在屋里的人们静静地倾听着屋外的欢声笑语。不过，即使是屋子里的这些悲痛的人们也感到一种深深的宽慰，因为他们终于再也不用担心会看到其他亲人死去，抑或是因为笼罩他们心头的唯恐自身难保的阴霾已经烟消云散。而最无缘于这种大众欢庆场面的必然是这些家庭：就在此时，这些家庭中有一位鼠疫患者住在医院里，其余家人则住在隔离营里或家里接受强制隔离，等待着这场鼠疫能离他们而去，就像它对待其他人那样。当然，这些家庭也抱有希望，但他们将希望埋藏在心底，没有十分把握是不会表露出来的。这些家庭在沉默与放逐中等待着，处于伤感和欢乐之间，在周围喜庆的氛围中仍然显得格外冷酷。但这些例外并没有削弱大多数人的满意度。毫无疑问，鼠疫还没有结束——这一事实提醒着人们。不过，大家的想象比现实提前了好几周，他们似乎已经听到火车在一眼望不到头的铁轨上鸣笛前行的声音，也听到了轮船驶出海港，在波光粼粼的大海上破浪前行时发出的汽笛声。明天，这些狂热就会退去，疑虑又会回来。但在此时，整座城市就像一艘轮船一样开动起来，正在驶离它曾经的停泊之地，驶离这阴暗悲伤的囚禁之地，并最终满载着幸存者驶往充满希望的福地。这一天晚上，塔鲁、里厄、朗贝尔和他们的同事混杂在欢庆游行的队伍中走了一会儿，他们也有一种飘飘欲仙的感觉。在他们离开主干道很久之后，甚至当他们沿着空荡荡的小巷走过一幢幢紧闭着百叶窗的房屋时，欢快的叫嚷声依然不绝于耳，但由于他们已经累了，他们根本无法把紧闭的百叶窗后的痛苦和主干道上洋溢的欢乐分离开来。所以，在这接近解禁的时刻却是冰火两重天，既有眼泪，也有欢乐。","This state of subdued yet active ferment prevailed until January 25, when the weekly total showed so striking a decline that, after consulting the medical board, the authorities announced that the epidemic could be regarded as definitely stemmed.True, the communique went on to say that, acting with a prudence of which the population would certainly approve, the Prefect had decided that the gates of the town were to remain closed for two weeks more, and the prophylactic measures to remain in force for another month.During this period, at the least sign of danger ‘‘the standing orders would be strictly enforced and, if necessary, prolonged thereafter for such a period as might be deemed desirable.”All, however, concurred in regarding these phrases as mere official verbiage, and the night of January 25 was the occasion of much festivity.To associate himself with the popular rejoicings, the Prefect gave orders for the street lighting to be resumed as in the past.And the townspeople paraded the brilliantly lighted streets in boisterous groups, laughing and singing.True, in some houses the shutters remained closed, and those within listened in silence to the joyful shouts outside.Yet even in these houses of mourning a feeling of deep relief prevailed; whether because at last the fear of seeing other members of the household taken from them was calmed or because the shadow of personal anxiety was lifted from their hearts.The families that perforce withdrew themselves the most from the general jubilation were those who at this hour had one of their members down with plague in hospital and, whether in a quarantine camp or at home, waited in enforced seclusion for the epidemic to have done with them as it had done with the others.No doubt these families had hopes, but they hoarded them and forbade themselves to draw on them before feeling quite sure they were justified.And this time of waiting in silence and exile, in a limbo between joy and grief, seemed still crueler for the gladness all around them.But these exceptions did not diminish the satisfaction of the great majority.No doubt the plague was not yet ended—a fact of which they were to be reminded; still, in imagination they could already hear, weeks in advance, trains whistling on their way to an outside world that had no limit, and steamers hooting as they put out from the harbor across shining seas.Next day these fancies would have passed and qualms of doubt returned.But for the moment the whole town was on the move, quitting the dark, lugubrious confines where it had struck its roots of stone, and setting forth at last, like a shipload of survivors, toward a land of promise.That night Tarrou, Rieux, Rambert, and their colleagues joined for a while the marching crowds and they, too, felt as if they trod on air.Long after they had turned off the main streets, even when in empty byways they walked past shuttered houses, the joyful clamor followed them up, and because of their fatigue somehow they could not disassociate the sorrow behind those closed shutters from the joy filling the central streets.Thus the coming liberation had a twofold aspect, of happiness and tears."
"有一会儿，远处那欢快的叫嚷声变得更响了，塔鲁突然停了下来。有一个瘦小、皮毛油光发亮的黑影在沿着街道奔跑：是一只猫，这是春天以来他们见到的第一只猫。它在马路中央停了一会儿，舔舔爪子，用爪子迅速地挠一下右耳朵，接着它又重新向前奔跑起来，渐渐消失在黑暗之中。塔鲁暗自发笑，那个阳台上的矮老头也会高兴的。","At one moment, when the cries of exultation in the distance were swelling to a roar, Tarrou stopped abruptly.A small, sleek form was scampering along the roadway: a cat, the first cat any of them had seen since the spring.It stopped in the middle of the road, hesitated, licked a paw and quickly passed it behind its right ear; then it started forward again and vanished into the darkness.Tarrou smiled to himself; the little old man on the balcony, too, would be pleased."
"第二十六章","Chapter 26"
"但是，如果塔鲁的笔记记载正确的话，就在鼠疫似乎全面撤退、潜回到它那不为人知的老巢的这段日子里，城里至少有一个人为此感到惊惶失措，这人就是科塔尔。","But in those days when the plague seemed to be retreating, slinking back to the obscure lair from which it had stealthily emerged, at least one person in the town viewed this retreat with consternation, if Tarrou’s notes are to be trusted; and that man was Cottard."
"说实话，自死亡人数开始下降之日起，塔鲁的笔记就变得相当奇怪。笔记的书写变得更难辨认了——这可能是由于疲劳的缘故——而且，笔记的内容也是东拉西扯。此外，这段时间的笔记不像以往那样客观了，笔记中开始悄悄出现许多个人见解。所以，在有关科塔尔情况的长篇叙述中间，就有一小段关于这个玩猫老头的记录。塔鲁认为鼠疫丝毫没有减弱他对这位老头的欣赏。鼠疫自然消退后，他对老头依旧颇感兴趣。遗憾的是，后来老头再也不能引起他的兴趣了，而这并非由于塔鲁缺乏诚意。他已经尽力去找过这老头了。在那个难以忘怀的1月25日之后又过了几天，他孤身一人去那条小巷的拐角处站了一会儿。那些猫儿已回到原地，呆在几小块阳光充裕的地方晒太阳。但在老头习惯出现的时刻，百叶窗依然紧闭着。而且，塔鲁在此后一段时间里也从未看见百叶窗开过。于是，他得出了一个很奇怪的结论：老头要么死了，要么正在恼火——他要是在恼火，是因为他认为自己做得对，而鼠疫冤枉了他；他要是死了，就该想想这个问题（那位老气喘病人的情况也是如此）：他是不是一个圣人？塔鲁并不认为这老头是个圣人，但发现他的情况能给人“启示”。“也许，”塔鲁写道，“我们只能达到近乎圣人的标准。在这种情况下，我们不得不做个温和而仁慈的恶魔。”","To tell the truth, these diary notes take a rather curious turn from the date on which the death returns began to drop.The handwriting becomes much harder to read—this may have been due to fatigue—and the diarist jumps from one topic to another without transition.What is more, these later notes lack the objectivity of the earlier ones; personal considerations creep in.Thus, sandwiched between long passages dealing with the case of Cottard, we find a brief account of the old man and the cats.Tarrou conveys to us that the plague had in no wise lessened his appreciation of the old fellow, who continued equally to interest him after the epidemic had run its course; unfortunately, he could not go on interesting him, and this through no lack of good intentions on Tarrou’s part.He had done his best to see him again.Some days after that memorable 25th of January he stationed himself at the corner of the little street.The cats were back at their usual places, basking in the patches of sunlight.But at the ritual hour the shutters stayed closed.And never once did Tarrou see them open on the following days.He drew the rather odd conclusion that the old fellow was either dead or vexed—if vexed, the reason being that he had thought that he was right and the plague had put him in the wrong; if dead, the question was (as in the case of the old asthmatic) had he been a saint?Tarrou hardly thought so, but he found in the old man’s case “a pointer.”“Perhaps,” he wrote, “we can only reach approximations of sainthood.In which case we must make shift with a mild, benevolent diabolism.”"
"在有关科塔尔的叙述中还零星地夹杂着一些关于格朗的评论——格朗现在已经康复并回到了工作岗位，就好像什么也没发生过一样——以及对里厄母亲的评论。塔鲁在笔记里详细记录了他与同住在一个屋檐下的里厄母亲之间偶尔的交谈内容、这位老太太的态度，以及她对鼠疫的看法。他首先着重描写了里厄老太太的谦卑，她那言简意赅的说话方式，以及她对某一扇窗户的偏爱。她总爱在傍晚时分坐在这扇窗前，微微挺着身子，双手放在膝盖上，两眼注视着窗外宁静的大街，直到夜幕笼罩着整间屋子。她那静坐不动的黑色身影也慢慢融入到逐渐降临的黑暗之中。他谈到她从一间屋子走到另一间屋子时步伐的“轻盈”，谈到她的善良——尽管他举不出具体的例子，但他从她的言行之中处处都能隐约察觉到她温和善良之光。他谈到她具有一种无须多加思索就能洞察一切的天赋，最后他还谈到，尽管她毫不起眼、沉默寡言，却不会畏惧任何光亮，哪怕是像鼠疫那般刺眼的光芒。奇怪的是，塔鲁的笔记写到这里，笔迹就突然变得糟糕起来，事实上，他接下来写的几行文字几乎难以辨认。而且，最后几行文字写的是他的个人私事——这在笔记中还是头一回——这似乎再次证明他已经控制不住他的笔了。“她令我想起了我的母亲，我最喜欢母亲那种谦卑及‘不起眼’的品质，我也一直想回到她的身边。八年前她就不在了，但我不能说她已经死了。她只是比以往更为谦卑地躲了起来，而我环顾四周之时，却再也看不到她的身影。”","Interspersed with observations relating to Cottard are remarks, scattered here and there, about Grand—he was now convalescent and had gone back to work as if nothing had happened—and about Rieux’s mother.The occasional conversations he had with her, when living under the same roof, the old lady’s attitudes, her opinions on the plague, are all recorded in detail in the diary.Tarrou lays stress above all on Mme Rieux’s self-effacement, her way of explaining things in the simplest possible words, her predilection for a special window at which she always sat in the early evening, holding herself rather straight, her hands at rest, her eyes fixed on the quiet street below, until twilight filled the room and she showed among the gathering shadows as a motionless black form which gradually merged into the invading darkness.He remarks on the “lightness” with which she moved from one room to the other; on her kindness—though no precise instances had come to his notice he discerned its gentle glow in all she said and did; on the gift she had of knowing everything without (apparently) taking thought; and lastly that, dim and silent though she was, she quailed before no light, even the garish light of the plague.At this point Tarrou’s handwriting began to fall off oddly; indeed, the following lines were almost illegible.And, as if in confirmation of this loss of grip upon himself, the last lines of the entry deal—for the first time in the diary—with his personal life.“She reminds me of my mother; what I loved most in Mother was her self-effacement, her ‘dimness,’ as they say, and it’s she I’ve always wanted to get back to.It happened eight years ago; but I can’t say she died.She only effaced herself a trifle more than usual, and when I looked round she was no longer there.”"
"不过，现在言归正传，谈谈科塔尔吧。自从每周的死亡总数开始下降以来，他就以种种借口前去拜访了里厄几次。但很显然，他真正的目的是想了解里厄对疫情大致发展的判断。“难道你真的认为鼠疫就这样突然一下就结束了吗？”他对此很怀疑，或者至少他公开表达过这一点。但他又不断地提出这个相同的问题，这似乎表明他也不太确信自己的观点。从一月中旬开始，里厄就很乐观地回答了这个问题。但每一次，这些回答并没有使科塔尔感到高兴，反而使他产生种种不同的反应，有时只是气急败坏，有时又极度沮丧。有一天，医生不得不对他说，尽管统计数字表明情况大有好转，但要说大家已经脱离了险境还为时尚早。","But to return to Cottard.When the weekly totals began to show a decline, he visited Rieux several times on various pretexts.But obviously what he really wanted was to get from Rieux his opinion on the probable course of the epidemic.“Do you really think it can stop like that, all of a sudden?”He was skeptical about this, or anyhow professed to be.But the fact that he kept on asking the question seemed to imply he was less sure than he professed to be.From the middle of January Rieux gave him fairly optimistic answers.But these were not to Cottard’s liking, and his reactions varied on each occasion, from mere petulance to great despondency.One day the doctor was moved to tell him that, though the statistics were highly promising, it was too soon to say definitely that we were out of the wood."
"“这就是说，”科塔尔立刻说，“一切都还是未知数。鼠疫可能随时又会卷土重来。”","“In other words,” Cottard said promptly, “there’s no knowing.It may start again at any moment.”"
"“确实如此。但同样，治愈率也可能越来越高。”","“Quite so.Just as it’s equally possible the improvement may speed up.”"
"这种捉摸不定的状况令所有其他人都感到担忧，唯独科塔尔一人看起来很满意。塔鲁注意到，科塔尔会与他那个区里的商人们进行交谈，竭力宣传里厄的观点。事实上，他不难做到这一点。宣布鼠疫退去后的那种最初的狂热已经过去，许多人的思想里又重新产生了怀疑。一看到大家忐忑不安的样子，科塔尔就感到放心。但有时他又感到沮丧。“对，”他沮丧地对塔鲁说，“总有一天城门会敞开的。到那时，你就看吧，人们会把我像燃烧的煤块一样撇下不管的！”在一月份的头三个星期里，大家惊讶地发现科塔尔的情绪变化无常。尽管他通常都会不遗余力地设法讨好他的邻居和熟人们，但现在这段时间，他却故意冷落他们。他突然退出了他以前经常出入的社交场合，切断了一切与外界的联系，身心忧郁地躲了起来。在饭店里，在戏院里，或是在他爱去的咖啡馆里，人们再也见不到他的身影。但是，他似乎也不能回到他在发生鼠疫前所过的那种平凡单调、不引人注目的生活了。他呆在自己的房间里，叫附近的一家餐馆给他送来一日三餐。只有在晚上，他才敢跑出去零星地买些小东西，而出了店门，他就会偷偷摸摸地在人迹罕至的阴暗街道里溜达。那时候塔鲁碰见过他一两回，但也只能引他态度生硬地说上寥寥数语。不过，过不了几天，他又重新热衷于交际，滔滔不绝地谈论鼠疫，征求每个人的意见，并兴致勃勃地混迹于人群之中。","Distressing to everyone else, this state of uncertainty seemed to agree with Cottard.Tarrou observed that he would enter into conversations with shopkeepers in his part of the town, with the obvious desire of propagating the opinion expressed by Rieux.Indeed, he had no trouble in doing this.After the first exhilaration following the announcement of the plague’s decline had worn off, doubts had returned to many minds.And the sight of their anxiety reassured Cottard.Just as at other times he yielded to discouragement.“Yes,” he said gloomily to Tarrou, “one of these days the gates will be opened.And then, you’ll see, they’ll drop me like a live coal!”Everyone was struck by his abrupt changes of mood during the first three weeks of January.Though normally he spared no pains to make himself liked by neighbors and acquaintances, now, for whole days, he deliberately cold-shouldered them.On these occasions, so Tarrou gathered, he abruptly cut off outside contacts and retired morosely into his shell.He was no more to be seen in restaurants or at the theater or in his favorite cafes.However, he seemed unable to resume the obscure, humdrum life he had led before the epidemic.He stayed in his room and had his meals sent up from a near-by restaurant.Only at nightfall did he venture forth to make some small purchases, and on leaving the shop he would furtively roam the darker, less-frequented streets.Once or twice Tarrou ran into him on these occasions, but failed to elicit more than a few gruff monosyllables.Then, from one day to another, he became sociable again, talked volubly about the plague, asking everyone for his views on it, and mingled in the crowd with evident pleasure."
"1月25日官方发布公告那天，科塔尔又一次不见了踪迹。两天后，塔鲁在一条小巷里碰见了在那里徘徊的科塔尔。当科塔尔提出要塔鲁陪他一起回家时，塔鲁犹豫了一下，那天塔鲁感到特别累。但科塔尔根本不容对方拒绝。他看起来非常激动，不停地打着手势，说话的语速很快，声音也很大。他首先问塔鲁是否真的认为官方公告就意味着鼠疫的结束。塔鲁回答说，一份官方公告本身显然是不能终止一场疫病的，但鼠疫看起来好像真的行将结束了，除非发生意外。“对，”科塔尔说，“除非发生意外。往往会出现意外，不是吗？”","On January 25, the day of the official announcement, Cottard went to cover again.Two days later Tarrou came across him loitering in a side-street.When Cottard suggested he should accompany him home, Tarrou demurred; he’d had a particularly tiring day.But Cottard wouldn’t hear of a refusal.He seemed much agitated, gesticulated freely, spoke very rapidly and in a very loud tone.He began by asking Tarrou if he really thought the official communique meant an end of the plague.Tarrou replied that obviously a mere official announcement couldn’t stop an epidemic, but it certainly looked as if, barring accidents, it would shortly cease.“Yes,” Cottard said.“Barring accidents.And accidents will happen, won’t they?”"
"塔鲁指出，当局已经作好准备以防意外，因而下令城门还要继续关闭两周。","Tarrou pointed out that the authorities had allowed for that possibility by refusing to open the gates for another fortnight."
"“当局真是英明呀！”科塔尔继续兴奋地说，“按照形势的发展，我觉得他们恐怕要食言了。”","“And very wise they were!” Cottard exclaimed in the same excited tone.“By the way things are going, I should say they’ll have to eat their words.”"
"塔鲁认为这事也有可能，不过，他觉得最好还是要相信，在不久的将来，城门将会敞开，生活也会恢复正常。","Tarrou agreed this might be so; still, he thought it wiser to count on the opening of the gates and a return to normal life in the near future."
"“就算是这样吧！”科塔尔说，“那你说的‘生活恢复正常’是什么意思呢？”","“Granted!” Cottard rejoined.“But what do you mean by ‘a return to normal life’?”"
"塔鲁笑着说：“电影院里有新的影片。”","Tarrou smiled.“New films at the picture-houses.”"
"但科塔尔没有笑。他想问，人们是不是认为鼠疫并没有改变任何东西，而这个城市的生活也会一如既往地继续下去，就像什么也没发生过一样？塔鲁认为，鼠疫会改变一切，又不会改变一切。市民们最大的希望就是正常地生活，就当什么也没有变样，因此，从某种意义上说，什么也不会改变。但是——换一个角度来看——无论人们多想忘记一切，他们也无法做到这一点，不管怎样，鼠疫一定会在人们的心里留下一些痕迹。","But Cottard didn’t smile.Was it supposed, he asked, that the plague wouldn’t have changed anything and the life of the town would go on as before, exactly as if nothing had happened?Tarrou thought that the plague would have changed things and not changed them; naturally our fellow citizens’ strongest desire was, and would be, to behave as if nothing had changed and for that reason nothing would be changed, in a sense.But—to look at it from another angle—one can’t forget everything, however great one’s wish to do so; the plague was bound to leave traces, anyhow, in people’s hearts."
"科塔尔马上接过话说，他对心理问题不感兴趣；的确，他最不在乎的就是心理问题了。他只是很想知道整个行政管理是否会发生变化，比如说，公共服务的职能是否与往日一样。塔鲁不得不承认他对此真是心里没底，他个人的看法是，在遭受了鼠疫的重创之后，公共服务恢复正常尚需时日。此外，看来很有可能会出现各类新问题，因而行政管理体系至少也需要进行一些调整。","To this Cottard rejoined curtly that he wasn’t interested in hearts; indeed, they were the last thing he bothered about.What interested him was knowing whether the whole administration wouldn’t be changed, lock, stock, and barrel; whether, for instance, the public services would function as before.Tarrou had to admit he had no inside knowledge on the matter; his personal theory was that after the upheaval caused by the epidemic, there would be some delay in getting these services under way again.Also, it seemed likely that all sorts of new problems would arise and necessitate at least some reorganization of the administrative system."
"科塔尔点点头说：“对，这很有可能，事实上，大家都得重新开始。”","Cottard nodded.“Yes, that’s quite on the cards; in fact everyone will have to make a fresh start.”"
"他们走到科塔尔家附近了。科塔尔现在显得更开心了，他下定决心要更加乐观地看待未来。很显然，他想象着这座城市正在进入一种全新的生活，忘却过去，一切都重新开始。","They were nearing Cottard’s house.He now seemed more cheerful, determined to take a rosier view of the future.Obviously he was picturing the town entering on a new lease of life, blotting out its past and starting again with a clean sheet."
"“就是这样，”塔鲁微笑着说，“事情的结果很有可能会好起来的，对你也一样——谁又知道呢？从某种意义上说，大家都将开始新的生活。”","“So that’s that,” Tarrou smiled.“Quite likely things will pan out all right for you, too—who can say?It’ll be a new life for all of us, in a manner of speaking.”"
"他们在科塔尔所住的公寓楼门口握手告别。","They were shaking hands at the door of the apartment house where Cottard lived."
"“你说得对！”科塔尔越来越激动地说，“一切重新开始，这是个好主意。”","“Quite right!” Cottard was growing more and more excited.“That would be a great idea, starting again with a clean sheet.”"
"突然，两个男子从漆黑的大厅里走了出来。塔鲁刚听到科塔尔喃喃地说了句：“哎，这两个家伙想干什么呀？”这两个衣冠楚楚、公务人员模样的男子就问科塔尔他是不是叫科塔尔。科塔尔发出了一声低沉的惊叫，然后转身飞奔而去，消失在夜色之中。塔鲁和这两位男子都惊呆了，大家面面相觑了一会儿。接着，塔鲁问他们想干什么。他们含糊地回答说，他们想“了解些情况”，然后就不慌不忙地朝着科塔尔刚才逃跑的方向走去。","Suddenly from the lightless hall two men emerged.Tarrou had hardly time to hear his companion mutter: “Now, what do those birds want?” when the men in question, who looked like subordinate government employees in their best clothes, cut in with an inquiry if his name was Cottard.With a stifled exclamation Cottard swung round and dashed off into the darkness.Taken by surprise, Tarrou and the two men gazed blankly at each other for some moments.Then Tarrou asked them what they wanted.In noncommittal tones they informed him that they wanted “some information,” and walked away, unhurrying, in the direction Cottard had taken."
"塔鲁一回到家就把刚才那件怪事记录了下来，接着又写下了“今晚很累”几个字——这段文字的笔迹证实了这一点。他接着写道，他还有很多事情要做，但这并不能成为自己不“做好准备”的理由，而他也自问他自己是否已做好准备。在最后附言式的文字中——事实上，塔鲁的笔记也就到此为止了——他这样写道：无论是在白天还是夜里，总会有那么一个时刻是一个人最怯懦的时刻，而只有这个时刻让他感到害怕。","On his return home Tarrou wrote out an account of this peculiar incident, following it up with a “Feeling very tired tonight”—which is confirmed by his handwriting in this entry.He added that he had still much to do, but that was no reason for not “holding himself in readiness,” and he questioned if he were ready.As a sort of postscript—and, in fact, it is here that Tarrou’s diary ends—he noted that there is always a certain hour of the day and of the night when a man’s courage is at its lowest ebb, and it was that hour only that he feared."

"第二天，即规定城门开放之日前几天，里厄医生中午回到家里，想知道他一直期盼的电报是否已送过来了。尽管这些天来他的工作与鼠疫高峰期时一样繁重，但马上就要获得解放这种希望已经驱散了他的疲劳。有了希望，对生活也就充满了新的渴望。任何人都不可能一直都精神高度紧张地生活着，在精力和意志都绷紧到极限后，终于可以放松一下，舒缓一下神经和肌肉了，这是件令人高兴的事情。如果里厄等待的这封电报带来好消息的话，他的生活也可以重新开始。的确，在那段日子里，他感觉大家一切都会重新开始。","When next day, a few days before the date fixed for the opening of the gates, Dr. Rieux came home at noon, he was wondering if the telegram he was expecting had arrived.Though his days were no less strenuous than at the height of the epidemic, the prospect of imminent release had obliterated his fatigue.Hope had returned and with it a new zest for life.No man can live on the stretch all the time, with his energy and willpower strained to the breaking-point, and it is a joy to be able to relax at last and loosen nerves and muscles that were braced for the struggle.If the telegram, too, that he awaited brought good news, Rieux would be able to make a fresh start.Indeed, he had a feeling that everyone in those days was making a fresh start."
"他从大厅的门房前走过。老米歇尔的接班人，那位新来的看门人把脸贴在面朝大厅的玻璃窗上，朝他微微一笑。当他上楼的时候，他的眼前还浮现出看门人那张因疲倦和贫穷而显得苍白的笑脸。","He walked past the concierge’s room in the hall.The new man, old Michel’s successor, his face pressed to the window looking on the hall, gave him a smile.As he went up the stairs, the man’s face, pale with exhaustion and privation, but smiling, hovered before his eyes."
"是的，当“抽象”阶段过去之后，只要有些运气，他将一切重新开始——他带着这些想法打开诊所门时，看见他母亲正从客厅下楼来找他。她告诉他，塔鲁先生病了。塔鲁早上照常起床，但感觉无力出门，所以又重新躺下了。里厄老太太很担心他的身体。","Yes, he’d make a fresh start, once the period of “abstractions” was over, and with any luck—He was opening the door with these thoughts in his mind when he saw his mother coming down the hall to meet him.M. Tarrou, she told him, wasn’t well.He had risen at the usual time, but did not feel up to going out and had returned to bed.Mme Rieux felt worried about him."
"“这大概不要紧。”她儿子说。","“Quite likely it’s nothing serious,” her son said."
"塔鲁直挺挺躺在床上，他那硕大的头部深深地陷在枕头里，盖在他健壮的胸脯上的被单上下起伏着。他感到头痛，体温也在不断上升。他对里厄说，他的症状并不确定，但有可能是鼠疫。","Tarrou was lying on his back, his heavy head deeply indenting the pillow, the coverlet bulging above his massive chest.His head was aching and his temperature up.The symptoms weren’t very definite, he told Rieux, but they might well be those of plague."
"里厄给他检查后说：“不，现在一切都还不确定。”","After examining him Rieux said: “No, there’s nothing definite as yet.”"
"但塔鲁也感到很口渴，因而医生在走廊里对他母亲说，这可能是鼠疫。","But Tarrou also suffered from a raging thirst, and in the hallway the doctor told his mother that it might be plague."
"“啊！”她大叫着说，“这根本不可能，现在根本不可能！”过了一会儿，她接着说：“我们把他留在这里吧，伯纳德。”","“Oh!” she exclaimed.“Surely that’s not possible, not now!”And after a moment added: “Let’s keep him here, Bernard.”"
"里厄沉思着。“严格来说，我没有权利这样做，”他迟疑地说，“不过，城门很快就要敞开了。要是你不在这里的话，我想我自己倒会这样做的。”","Rieux pondered.“Strictly speaking, I’ve no right to do that,” he said doubtfully.“Still, the gates will be opened quite soon.If you weren’t here, I think I’d take it on myself.”"
"“伯纳德，把他留下，也让我留下吧。你知道的，我刚刚又打过预防针了。”","“Bernard, let him stay, and let me stay too.You know, I’ve just had another inoculation.”"
"医生说塔鲁也打过预防针，但他可能因为太劳累而忘了注射最后一针或没有采取必要的预防措施。","The doctor pointed out that Tarrou, too, had had inoculations, though it was possible, tired as he was, he’d overlooked the last one or omitted to take the necessary precautions."
"里厄一边说着一边朝诊所走去，而等他回到卧室时，塔鲁看见他拿来了一个盒子，里面是些装满血清的针剂。","Rieux was going to the surgery as he spoke, and when he returned to the bedroom Tarrou noticed that he had a box of the big ampoules containing the serum."
"“啊，那么是鼠疫了。”塔鲁说。","“Ah, so it is that,” he said."
"“不一定是，但我们不该冒险。”","“Not necessarily; but we mustn’t run any risks.”"
"塔鲁没说什么，只是伸出一只胳膊来接受长时间的注射，他以前也常常给别人进行这样的注射。","Without replying Tarrou extended his arm and submitted to the prolonged injections he himself had so often administered to others."
"“我们今晚再好好观察一下。”里厄直视着塔鲁说。","“We’ll judge better this evening.” Rieux looked Tarrou in the eyes."
"“但怎么不把我隔离起来，里厄？”","“But what about isolating me, Rieux?”"
"“现在根本不能确定你患上了鼠疫。”","“It’s by no means certain that you have plague.”"
"塔鲁勉强笑了笑。","Tarrou smiled with an effort."
"“嗯，我还是头一回看到你给病人注射血清却不下令将他送进隔离病房。”","“Well, it’s the first time I’ve known you do the injection without ordering the patient off to the isolation ward.”"
"里厄转过头去。","Rieux looked away."
"“你在这里会好些。我母亲和我都会照料你的。”","“You’ll be better here.My mother and I will look after you.”"
"塔鲁沉默不语，医生把那些针剂放回到盒子里，想等到塔鲁说话时再转过头去。但塔鲁依然一声不吭，最后，里厄走到床边。病人平静地看着医生，尽管他的脸很憔悴，但他那双灰色的眼睛依然目光镇定。里厄微笑着朝塔鲁俯下身去。","Tarrou said nothing and the doctor, who was putting away the ampoules in the box, waited for him to speak before looking round.But still Tarrou said nothing, and finally Rieux went up to the bed.The sick man was gazing at him steadily, and though his face was drawn, the gray eyes were calm.Rieux smiled down on him."
"“现在你尽量睡会吧。我马上就会回来。”","“Now try to sleep.I’ll be back soon.”"
"医生正要出门时，听到塔鲁叫他，于是又返身回到病床边。塔鲁看起来怪怪的，就好像他既想阻止自己要说的话脱口而出，又想强迫自己说出来一样。","As he was going out he heard Tarrou calling, and turned back.Tarrou’s manner had an odd effect, as though he were at once trying to keep back what he had to say and forcing himself to say it."
"“里厄，”他终于开口说，“你必须对我说实话。我想知道实情。”","“Rieux,” he said at last, “you must tell me the whole truth.I count on that.”"
"“我一定会的。”","“I promise it.”"
"塔鲁的那张大脸露出了一丝笑容。","Tarrou’s heavy face relaxed in a brief smile."
"“谢谢。我不想死，我要斗争。即使我输了，我也想有个好结局。”里厄俯下身去，紧紧抓住塔鲁的肩膀。","“Thanks.I don’t want to die, and I shall put up a fight.But if I lose the match, I want to make a good end of it.”Bending forward, Rieux pressed his shoulder."
"“不会输的。要做一个圣人，你就该活下去。一定要斗争呀！”","“No.To become a saint, you need to live.So fight away!”"
"这天早上天气很冷，后来慢慢暖和了些，到了下午却又下了几场冰雹和大雨。黄昏时，天空微微放晴了，但天气却又变得寒冷起来。晚上，里厄回到家里。他大衣也没脱就走进了他朋友的房间。塔鲁似乎躺在床上没挪动过，但他那因高烧而变得苍白的紧闭的双唇显示出他正在坚持斗争着。","In the course of that day the weather, which after being very cold had grown slightly milder, broke in a series of violent hailstorms followed by rain.At sunset the sky cleared a little, and it was bitterly cold again.Rieux came home in the evening.His overcoat still on, he entered his friend’s bedroom.Tarrou did not seem to have moved, but his set lips, drained white by fever, told of the effort he he was keeping up."
"“还好吗？”里厄问。","“Well?” Rieux asked."
"塔鲁耸了耸他那露在被单外的宽肩膀。","Tarrou raised his broad shoulders a little out of the bedclothes."
"“唉，”他说，“我要输了。”","“Well,” he said, “I’m losing the match.”"
"医生朝塔鲁俯下身去。塔鲁那滚烫的皮肤下已经出现了淋巴结，他的肺部发出一阵杂音，就像地下炼铁厂发出的声音一样。奇怪的是，塔鲁身上同时出现了两种不同类型鼠疫的病征。","The doctor bent over him.Ganglia had formed under the burning skin and there was a rumbling in his chest, like the sound of a hidden forge.The strange thing was that Tarrou showed symptoms of both varieties of plague at once."
"里厄直起身来说，血清还未来得及发挥作用。塔鲁本想要说上几句，但他喉咙里突然涌起的一阵热流令他说不出话来。","Rieux straightened up and said the serum hadn’t yet had time to take effect.An uprush of fever in his throat drowned the few words that Tarrou tried to utter."
"晚饭后，里厄和他母亲来到病人床前。夜晚一到，斗争也开始了，而且，里厄知道这场与瘟神的艰巨较量会一直持续到黎明。在这场斗争中，塔鲁最大的优势不是他的虎背熊腰，而是里厄的针头下渗出的塔鲁的鲜血，以及他的血液中流淌的那种比灵魂还要更重要的某种东西，这是任何人类科学都无法解释清楚的。医生能做的只是看着他的朋友进行斗争。他接下来要做的是给塔鲁的脓肿注射些催熟剂——几个月来反复的失败使他认清了这些权宜之计的真正价值。事实上，他唯一能帮上病人的就是为这些措施的偶然生效创造机会，而这种偶然性往往处于休眠状态，要靠人以行动唤醒。运气也是他必不可少的帮手。因为鼠疫的某种表现已经令里厄感到迷惑不解了。鼠疫又一次竭尽所能来挫败人们用来对付它的策略，它似乎从那些确定是鼠疫大本营的地方撤退下来，却又在一些出人意料的地方重新发起了进攻。它又一次令人摸不着头脑。","After dinner Rieux and his mother took up their posts at the sick man’s bedside.The night began with a struggle, and Rieux knew that this grim wrestling with the angel of plague was to last until dawn.In this struggle Tarrou’s robust shoulders and chest were not his greatest assets; rather, the blood that had spurted under Rieux’s needle and, in this blood, that something more vital than the soul, which no human skill can bring to light.The doctor’s task could be only to watch his friend’s struggle.As to what he was about to do, the stimulants to inject, the abscesses to stimulate—many months’ repeated failures had taught him to appreciate such expedients at their true value.Indeed, the only way in which he might help was to provide opportunities for the beneficence of chance, which too often stays dormant unless roused to action.Luck was an ally he could not dispense with.For Rieux was confronted by an aspect of the plague that baffled him.Yet again it was doing all it could to confound the tactics used against it; it launched attacks in unexpected places and retreated from those where it seemed definitely lodged.Once more it was out to darken counsel."
"塔鲁一动不动地与鼠疫抗争着。一整夜，他从未因为鼠疫的袭击而感到焦虑不安，他只是用他那粗壮的身体默默地进行着斗争。他甚至一声未吭，他就是以这种方式来表示他的斗争不能再有片刻分心。里厄只能根据他朋友的眼睛来观察这种斗争的变化：塔鲁的眼睛忽睁忽闭，他的眼皮一会儿贴着眼球，一会儿又张开，他一会儿凝视着屋里的某样物品，一会儿又将目光收回到医生和里厄老太太身上。每当塔鲁和医生对视时，塔鲁都会费力地挤出一丝笑容。","Tarrou struggled without moving.Not once in the course of the night did he counter the enemy’s attacks by restless agitation; only with all his stolid bulk, with silence, did he carry on the fight.Nor did he even try to speak, thus intimating, after his fashion, that he could no longer let his attention stray.Rieux could follow the vicissitudes of the struggle only in his friend’s eyes, now open and now shut; in the eyelids, now more closely welded to the eyeball, now distended; and in his gaze fixed on some object in the room or brought back to the doctor and his mother.And each time it met the doctor’s gaze, with a great effort Tarrou smiled."
"有一会儿，街上传来一阵急促的脚步声。人们隐约听到了雷声，于是飞奔前行，而雷声越来越近，最后街上响起了哗啦啦的雨声，又一阵暴风雨向这座城市袭来，不久大雨夹杂着冰雹噼里啪啦地砸在人行道上。窗前的雨蓬剧烈地抖动着。暴风雨的声音一度分散了里厄的注意力，现在他的目光又回到阴暗的屋内，重新打量着在小床头灯灯光照射下的塔鲁的脸庞。里厄的母亲正在织着毛衣，她时不时抬眼看看病人。医生一切能做的都已经做了。暴风雨过去了，屋里更加安静了，只有无形战斗中那种默默的骚动充斥其中。失眠折磨着医生，在寂静的边缘中，他似乎听到一种轻轻的、奇怪的呼啸声，这种声音从鼠疫爆发以来一直萦绕在他的耳旁。他对母亲打了个手势，示意她该去睡觉了。她摇了摇头，眼睛变得更加炯炯有神，接着她认真检查起编织接头处的一处针脚来，她觉得此处织得不太好。里厄起身去给病人取了杯水，接着又重新坐了下来。","At one moment there came a sound of hurrying footsteps in the street.They were in flight before a distant throbbing which gradually approached until the street was loud with the clamor of the downpour; another rainsquall was sweeping the town, mingled presently with hailstones that clattered on the sidewalk.Window awnings were flapping wildly.Rieux, whose attention had been diverted momentarily by the noises of the squall, looked again across the shadows at Tarrou’s face, on which fell the light of a small bedside lamp.His mother was knitting, raising her eyes now and then from her work to gaze at the sick man.The doctor had done everything that could be done.When the squall had passed, the silence in the room grew denser, filled only by the silent turmoil of the unseen battle.His nerves overwrought by sleeplessness, the doctor fancied he could hear, on the edge of the silence, that faint eerie sibilance which had haunted his ears ever since the beginning of the epidemic.He made a sign to his mother, indicating she should go to bed.She shook her head, and her eyes grew brighter; then she examined carefully, at her needle-tips, a stitch of which she was unsure.Rieux got up, gave the sick man a drink, and sat down again."
"人行道上响起了一阵脚步声，声音越来越近，又渐渐远去；人们正趁着暴风雨的间歇匆忙地往家赶。医生第一次发现这天夜晚就像鼠疫前的夜晚一样，天色已晚，路上还有很多赶路的行人，但听不到救护车的车鸣声——这是一个摆脱了鼠疫的夜晚。瘟神似乎受到了寒冷、街灯、人群的驱赶，从这座城市的黑暗深处逃了出来，躲进了这间暖和的房间，向塔鲁那一动不动的身体发起了最后的进攻。它不再在屋顶上空挥舞着它的连枷。但它却在这间病房沉闷的空气里轻声呼啸，而里厄在整个守夜过程中听到的正是这种声音。现在，里厄只好期待着这种声音也会在这里停下来，期待着鼠疫也会在这里败下阵去。","Footsteps rang on the pavement, nearing, then receding; people were taking advantage of the lull to hurry home.For the first time the doctor realized that this night, without the clang of ambulances and full of belated wayfarers, was just like a night of the past—a plague-free night.It was as if the pestilence, hounded away by cold, the street-lamps, and the crowd, had fled from the depths of the town and taken shelter in this warm room and was launching its last offensive at Tarrou’s inert body.No longer did it thresh the air above the houses with its flail.But it was whistling softly in the stagnant air of the sickroom, and this it was that Rieux had been hearing since the long vigil began.And now it was for him to wait and watch until that strange sound ceased here too, and here as well the plague confessed defeat."
"快到黎明的时候，里厄朝他母亲凑过身去低声说：","A little before dawn Rieux leaned toward his mother and whispered: "
"“现在你最好去睡一会儿，好在八点钟时来接替我。睡前要记得滴注些药水。”","“You’d better have some rest now, as you’ll have to relieve rne at eight.Mind you take your drops before going to bed.”"
"里厄老太太站了起来，收好毛线活，走到病床边。塔鲁闭着眼睛已经有段时间了。他的头发已经被汗水浸湿了，贴在他倔强的额头上。里厄老太太叹了口气，塔鲁睁开了双眼。他看到了老太太那张俯向着他的温柔的脸，尽管他还在发烧，但他的嘴边又露出了顽强的笑容。不过他很快又闭上了眼睛。现在只留下里厄一人了，于是他坐到他母亲坐过的那张椅子上。这座城市还在睡梦之中，大街上万籁俱静。屋子里开始感觉到黎明的寒冷了。","Mme Rieux rose, folded her knitting, and went to the bedside.Tarrou had had his eyes shut for some time.Sweat had plastered his hair on his stubborn forehead.Mme Rieux sighed, and he opened his eyes.He saw the gentle face bent over him and, athwart the surge of fever, that steadfast smile took form again.But at once the eyes closed.Left to himself, Rieux moved into the chair his mother had just left.The street was silent and no sound came from the sleeping town.The chill of daybreak was beginning to make itself felt."
"医生打起盹来，但黎明时大街上一辆马车发出的吱嘎声很快唤醒了他。他打了个寒战，看了看塔鲁，知道这又是一个斗争间歇期，塔鲁也睡着了。箍着铁皮的马车木轮发出的辘辘声已经渐渐远去了。窗外依然是黑乎乎一片。当医生走到病床边时，塔鲁用毫无表情的眼睛看着他，像是还没睡醒似的。","The doctor dozed off, but very soon an early cart rattling down the street awaked him.Shivering a little, he looked at Tarrou and saw that a lull had come; he, too, was sleeping.The iron-shod wheels rumbled away into the distance.Darkness still was pressing on the windowpanes.When the doctor came beside the bed, Tarrou gazed at him with expressionless eyes, like a man still on the frontier of sleep."
"“你睡着了，是吗？”里厄问。","“You slept, didn’t you?” Rieux asked."
"“是的。”","“Yes.”"
"“呼吸顺畅些了吗？”","“Breathing better?”"
"“顺畅了一点。这说明什么问题吗？”","“A bit.Does that mean anything?”"
"里厄沉默了一会儿，接着他说：","Rieux kept silent for some moments; then he said: "
"“不，塔鲁，这不说明任何问题。你和我一样都清楚，早晨时病情往往会有所缓解。”“谢谢，”塔鲁赞同地点点头说，“请你始终告诉我实情。”","“No, Tarrou, it doesn’t mean anything.You know as well as I that there’s often a remission in the morning.”“Thanks.” Tarrou nodded his approval.“Always tell me the exact truth.”"
"里厄坐在病床边。在病人身旁，他可以感觉到病人的双腿就像墓前雕像的四肢一样僵硬。塔鲁的呼吸变得更困难了。","Rieux was sitting on the side of the bed.Beside him he could feel the sick man’s legs, stiff and hard as the limbs of an effigy on a tomb.Tarrou was breathing with more difficulty."
"“还会发烧，是吗，里厄？”他喘着气说。","“The fever’ll come back, won’t it, Rieux?” he gasped."
"“是的。但要到中午我们才知道情况如何。”","“Yes.But at noon we shall know where we stand.”"
"塔鲁闭上眼睛，看起来他像是在养精蓄锐。他满面倦容。他在等待着体温上升，而这时高烧正在他身体深处翻腾着。当他睁开双眼时，他目光迷蒙。只是当他看到里厄手里端着一个平底杯俯身靠近他时，他才目光一亮。","Tarrou shut his eyes; he seemed to be mustering up his strength.There was a look of utter weariness on his face.He was waiting for the fever to rise and already it was stirring somewhat in the depths of his being.When he opened his eyes, his gaze was misted.It brightened only when he saw Rieux bending over him, a tumbler in his hand."
"“喝水吧。”","“Drink.”"
"塔鲁喝了水，然后慢慢将头靠在枕头上。","Tarrou drank, then slowly lowered his head on to the pillow."
"“这是个漫长的过程。”他喃喃地说。","“It’s a long business,” he murmured."
"里厄抓住他的手臂，但塔鲁已经转过头去，没作任何反应。突然，高烧像身体内决堤的潮水一样再次向塔鲁袭来，烧红了他的脸颊和前额。塔鲁的目光转向了医生，而医生这时正再次俯下身，用带着关切的鼓励神情看着他。塔鲁想给医生一个笑脸，但他那紧闭的牙关以及糊着一层白沫的嘴唇使他无法如愿。在他那僵硬的脸上，只有那双眼睛依然炯炯有神，闪烁着勇敢的光芒。","Rieux clasped his arm, but Tarrou, whose head was averted, showed no reaction.Then suddenly, as if some inner dike had given way without warning, the fever surged back, dyeing his cheeks and forehead.Tarrou’s eyes came back to the doctor, who, bending again, gave him a look of affectionate encouragement.Tarrou tried to shape a smile, but it could not force its way through the set jaws and lips welded by dry saliva.In the rigid face only the eyes lived still, glowing with courage."
"七点时，里厄老太太回到了病人的卧室。医生到他的诊所打电话给医院，安排别人在那里接替他的工作。他还决定推迟他的门诊时间，接着他在诊所的的沙发上躺了一会儿。五分钟后，他又回到了病人的卧室。塔鲁的脸朝着里厄老太太，而老太太紧靠床坐着，双手并拢放在腿上。在屋内阴暗的灯光下，她看起来只不过是个小黑影罢了。塔鲁聚精会神地看着里厄老太太，于是老太太把一根手指头放到自己的嘴唇上示意，并站起身来关掉了那盏床头灯。但窗帘后的光线渐渐变强，一会儿病人的脸就变得清晰可见了，里厄老太太发现他的目光依然聚在她身上。她俯下身子，将他的枕头弄平，又直起身子，把手放在他潮湿而杂乱的头发上，停留了一会儿。这时，她听到一声低沉的声音说“谢谢”，仿佛从远方传来，还对她说现在一切都很好。等她重新坐下时，塔鲁已闭上了眼睛，尽管他的嘴巴紧闭着，但他那衰弱的脸上似乎隐隐洋溢着一丝笑容。","At seven Mme Rieux returned to the bedroom.The doctor went to the surgery to ring up the hospital and arrange for a substitute.He also decided to postpone his consultations; then lay down for some moments on the surgery couch.Five minutes later he went back to the bedroom.Tarrou’s face was turned toward Mme Rieux, who was sitting close beside the bed, her hands folded on her lap; in the dim light of the room she seemed no more than a darker patch of shadow.Tarrou was gazing at her so intently that, putting a finger to her lips, Mme Rieux rose and switched off the bedside lamp.Behind the curtains the light was growing, and presently, when the sick man’s face grew visible, Mme Ricux could see his eyes still intent on her.Bending above the bed, she smoothed out the bolster and, as she straightened up, laid her hand for a moment on his moist, tangled hair.Then she heard a muffled voice, which seemed to come from very far away, murmur: “Thank you,” and that all was well now.By the time she was back in her chair Tarrou had shut his eyes, and, despite the sealed mouth, a faint smile seemed to hover on the wasted face."
"到了中午，高烧达到了顶点。一阵发自体内深处的咳嗽折磨着病人的身体，而且他现在开始吐起血来。他的淋巴结已停止肿胀，但仍未消退，硬得像嵌在关节上的螺丝帽。里厄认为要切开这些淋巴结已是不可能了。在一阵阵高烧和咳嗽发作间隙，塔鲁依然时不时地看看他的两位朋友。但不久之后，他睁开眼睛的次数变得越来越少了，而在发作间歇他那受尽蹂躏的脸上所呈现出的光芒也变得越来越弱了。这场发作就像是暴风雨，使他的身体不断抽搐。他在这场猛烈的暴风雨中随波逐流，越来越虚弱，最后被完全抛弃了。现在，里厄的眼前只是一张面具似的脸庞，毫无生气，笑容也永远消逝了。他朋友的人类之躯被瘟神的长矛刺得遍体鳞伤，被灼热的魔火烧得体无完肤，被这从天而降的狂暴的妖风吹得扭曲变形，而他只能眼睁睁地看着塔鲁淹没在鼠疫黑色的洪水之中，却无力帮他免于遇难。　他只好无可奈何地站在岸上，空着双手，心如刀绞，在灾难发生时又一次没有武器，孤独无助。就这样，等到最后一刻到来时，无能为力的泪水已经模糊了里厄的视线。他没有看见塔鲁猛地一翻身，面朝着墙低沉地呻吟了一声，像是他体内的某个地方有一根主弦绷断了似的，就这样断了气。第二天晚上再没有了战斗，而是万籁俱静。在这间安静的停尸房里，在这具已经穿好日常衣着的尸体旁，里厄又一次感觉到这里笼罩着一种自然的宁静——许多天以前的一个夜晚，在城门口发生短暂冲突之后，他坐在高高凌驾于鼠疫之上的那个露台上，也曾感觉到这种气氛。那时侯，他就想起了病人死去时病床上空笼罩着的这种宁静的气氛。就像现在一样，这是种庄严的间歇，这是种战斗过后的间歇，这是一种战败之后的沉寂。但现在笼罩在他已逝朋友周围的宁静的气氛是那么浓郁，这与大街上以及这座最终摆脱了鼠疫的城市夜间的宁静气氛非常相似，这也使得里厄非常清楚，这是最后的一次失败，它是结束战争的最后一场惨烈的战役，它自己终结了自己，这场大病无药可救。医生无法知道塔鲁是否找到了安宁，但现在一切都结束了。对他而言，他就像是个失去了儿子的母亲，或是个埋葬了朋友的男子一样，再也不可能拥有内心的安宁了。","At noon the fever reached its climax.A visceral cough racked the sick man’s body and he now was spitting blood.The ganglia had ceased swelling, but they were still there, like lumps of iron embedded in the joints.Rieux decided that lancing them was impracticable.Now and then, in the intervals between bouts of fever and coughing fits, Tarrou still gazed at his friends.But soon his eyes opened less and less often and the glow that shone out from the ravaged face in the brief moments of recognition grew steadily fainter.The storm, lashing his body into convulsive movement, lit it up with ever rarer flashes, and in the heart of the tempest he was slowly drifting, derelict.And now Rieux had before him only a masklike face, inert, from which the smile had gone forever.This human form, his friend’s, lacerated by the spear-thrusts of the plague, consumed by searing, superhuman fires, buffeted by all the raging winds of heaven, was foundering under his eyes in the dark flood of the pestilence, and he could do nothing to avert the wreck.He could only stand, unavailing, on the shore, empty-handed and sick at heart, unarmed and helpless yet again under the onset of calamity.And thus, when the end came, the tears that blinded Rieux’s eyes were tears of impotence; and he did not see Tarrou roll over, face to the wall, and die with a short, hollow groan as if somewhere within him an essential chord had snapped.The next night was not one of struggle but of silence.In the tranquil death-chamber, beside the dead body now in everyday clothing—here, too, Rieux felt it brooding, that elemental peace which, when he was sitting many nights before on the terrace high above the plague, had followed the brief foray at the gates.Then, already, it had brought to his mind the silence brooding over the beds in which he had let men die.There as here it was the same solemn pause, the lull that follows battle; it was the silence of defeat.But the silence now enveloping his dead friend, so dense, so much akin to the nocturnal silence of the streets and of the town set free at last, made Rieux cruelly aware that this defeat was final, the last disastrous battle that ends a war and makes peace itself; an ill beyond all remedy.The doctor could not tell if Tarrou had found peace, now that all was over, but for himself he had a feeling that no peace was possible to him henceforth, any more than there can be an armistice for a mother bereaved of her son or for a man who buries his friend."
"又是一个寒冷的夜晚，明朗而凄冷的天空中寒星闪烁。在昏暗的屋子里，他们感到一阵寒气正透过玻璃窗向他们袭来，他们也听到寒夜悠长而清亮的叹息声。里厄老太太以她常有的姿势坐在床边，床头灯照亮了她的右侧。在屋子中央，灯光照不到的地方，里厄静静地坐在那里。他时不时想起他的妻子，但每次他都尽力抛开这种想法。","The night was cold again, with frosty stars sparkling in a clear, wintry sky.And in the dimly lit room they felt the cold pressing itself to the windowpanes and heard the long, silvery suspiration of a polar night.Mme Rieux sat near the bed in her usual attitude, her right side lit up by the bedside lamp.In the center of the room, outside the little zone of light, Rieux sat, waiting.Now and then thoughts of his wife waylaid him, but he brushed them aside each time."
"夜幕降临时，寒冷的空气中，行人走路时鞋跟发出轻快的咯噔声。","When the night began, the heels of passers-by had rung briskly in the frozen air."
"“你已经安排好一切了吗？”里厄老太太问。","“Have you attended to everything?” Mme Rieux had asked."
"“是的，我已打过电话了。”","“Yes, I’ve telephoned.”"
"接着，他们又重新开始默默地守灵。里厄老太太不时地看看她的儿子，每当母子俩目光交汇时，里厄总是微微一笑。屋外大街上那些夜间熟悉的声音打破了夜的沉寂。尽管城里还没有正式批准车辆通行，但许多车辆都在马路上重新行驶起来。它们在路面上加速飞驰而过，车胎和人行道摩擦着发出一阵长长的嘶嘶声，然后倒车，返回。说话声，远处的呼唤声，随后又一切归于沉寂，接着又传来马蹄声，电车转弯时的吱嘎声，隐约的嘈杂声——然后又是轻轻的晚风声。","Then they had resumed their silent vigil.From time to time Mme Rieux stole a glance at her son, and whenever he caught her doing this, he smiled.Out in the street the usual night-time sounds bridged the long silences.A good many cars were on the road again, though officially this was not yet permitted; they sped past with a long hiss of tires on the pavement, receded, and returned.Voices, distant calls, silence again, a clatter of horse hoofs, the squeal of streetcars rounding a curve, vague murmurs—then once more the quiet breathing of the night."
"“伯纳德？”","“Bernard?”"
"“嗯？”","“Yes?”"
"“你不累吧？”","“Not too tired?”"
"“不累。”","“No.”"
"他知道他母亲这时在想什么，他知道她爱他。但他也知道，爱一个人并没有什么了不起的，又或者可以说，爱的强烈是永远无法找到合适的语言予以表达的。因此，他和他母亲会永远默默地爱着对方。有一天，她——或是他——终会死去，而在他们的一生中，他们从来没有向对方说出自己的爱。同样，他曾和塔鲁一起生活过，而今晚塔鲁已经走了，但他们也没能在生活中尽享两人之间的友情。正像塔鲁自己所说的那样，他已经“输了”。但是他，里厄，又赢得了什么呢？他赢得的东西不过是这样一种经历：他懂得了鼠疫，它变成了回忆；懂得了友情，它也变成了回忆；也懂得了爱，而它注定也将成为回忆。因此，在鼠疫和生命的斗争中，人所能赢得的所有东西就是知识和回忆。也许，塔鲁会把这称作是“赢了”。又有一辆车驶过，里厄老太太稍稍动了动。里厄朝她微微一笑。她对他说她不累，但马上又说：","At that moment he knew what his mother was thinking, and that she loved him.But he knew, too, that to love someone means relatively little; or, rather, that love is never strong enough to find the words befitting it.Thus he and his mother would always love each other silently.And one day she—or he—would die, without ever, all their lives long, having gone farther than this by way of making their affection known.Thus, too, he had lived at Tarrou’s side, and Tarrou had died this evening without their friendship’s having had time to enter fully into the life of either.Tarrou had “lost the match,” as he put it.But what had he, Rieux, won?No more than the experience of having known plague and remembering it, of having known friendship and remembering it, of knowing affection and being destined one day to remember it.So all a man could win in the conflict between plague and life was knowledge and memories.But Tarrou, perhaps, would have called that winning the match.Another car passed, and Mme Rieux stirred slightly.Rieux smiled toward her.She assured him she wasn’t tired and immediately added: "
"“你该到山区那边去好好休息一段时间。”","“You must go and have a good long rest in the mountains, over there.”"
"“好的，妈妈。”","“Yes, Mother.”"
"他当然会去“那边”休息一下。这也是一个回忆往事的借口。不过，假如这就叫“赢了”的话——一个人只是懂得些东西，回忆些东西，却得不到所希望的东西，那么这种生活该有多难呀！很可能塔鲁就是这样生活过来的，他也知道，没有幻想的生活是阴郁而贫瘠的。没有希望，内心就不可能安宁，而且塔鲁认为，无论是谁，都无权给任何人判刑——尽管他很清楚，人都禁不住会去给别人判刑，甚至受害者有时也会变成刽子手——塔鲁一直生活在矛盾之中，从来没有得到过希望所带来的慰藉。他就是出于这个原因而想做圣人，想通过帮助他人来寻求内心安宁的吗？事实上，里厄并不知道这个问题的答案，而这也无关紧要。他会永远记住塔鲁的唯一形象：驾驶汽车时紧握方向盘的塔鲁，或是有着魁梧身躯现在却躺在那里一动不动的塔鲁。知识就意味着：一种生活的热情，一种死亡的形象。这无疑解释了为什么里厄医生在第二天早上得知他妻子去世的消息时能保持镇静。","Certainly he’d take a rest “over there.”It, too, would be a pretext for memory.But if that was what it meant, winning the match—how hard it must be to live only with what one knows and what one remembers, cut off from what one hopes for!It was thus, most probably, that Tarrou had lived, and he realized the bleak sterility of a life without illusions.There can be no peace without hope, and Tarrou, denying as he did the right to condemn anyone whomsoever—though he knew well that no one can help condemning and it befalls even the victim sometimes to turn executioner—Tarrou had lived a life riddled with contradictions and had never known hope’s solace.Did that explain his aspiration toward saintliness, his quest of peace by service in the cause of others?Actually Rieux had no idea of the answer to that question, and it mattered little.The only picture of Tarrou he would always have would be the picture of a man who firmly gripped the steering-wheel of his car when driving, or else the picture of that stalwart body, now lying motionless.Knowing meant that: a living warmth, and a picture of death.That, no doubt, explains Dr. Rieux’s composure on receiving next morning the news of his wife’s death."
"当时他正在自己的诊所里。他母亲几乎是跑着进来，递给他一份电报，接着她又出去给电报邮递员小费。当她返回时，她儿子手里正拿着这份打开的电报。她看了看他，但他却毅然盯着窗外；窗外洒满了冉冉升起在港口上空的朝阳的光辉。","He was in the surgery.His mother came in, almost running, and handed him a telegram; then went back to the hall to give the telegraph-boy a tip.When she returned, her son was holding the telegram open in his hand.She looked at him, but his eyes were resolutely fixed on the window; it was flooded with the effulgence of the morning sun rising above the harbor."
"“伯纳德。”她轻轻地叫了一声。","“Bernard,” she said gently."
"医生转过头来漠然地看了看她，就好像她是陌生人。","The doctor turned and looked at her almost as if she were a stranger."
"“电报说？”","“The telegram?”"
"“哦，”他说，“就是这样。在一周以前。”","“Yes,” he said, “that’s it.A week ago.”"
"里厄老太太把头转向窗户。里厄沉默了一会儿。接着，他叫他母亲不要哭，说自己已经预料到了，不过依然很难过。而他也清楚，在说这话的时候，这种痛苦的感觉并不陌生。好几个月以来，尤其在最近的两天时间里，正是这种相同的痛苦一直折磨着他。","Mme Rieux turned her face toward the window.Rieux kept silent for a while.Then he told his mother not to cry, he’d been expecting it, but it was hard all the same.And he knew, in saying this, that this suffering was nothing new.For many months, and for the last two days, it was the selfsame suffering going on and on."
"第二十八章","Chapter 28"
"终于，在二月的一个黎明，天气晴朗，城门开放仪式如期举行，百姓、报纸、电台以及官方公报都为之喝彩。笔者依然觉得有必要记录下城门开放后的那些欢乐情景，尽管他自己属于那些不能全身心地分享这种喜悦的一员。","At last, at daybreak on a fine February morning, the ceremonial opening of the gates took place, acclaimed by the populace, the newspapers, the radio, and official communiques.It only remains for the narrator to give what account he can of the rejoicings that followed, though he himself was one of those debarred from sharing in them wholeheartedly."
"精心编排的游乐会整天整夜地举行着，同时，火车站里的火车头也开始冒烟了，轮船也已经驶入了这里的港口——这一切以各种方式生动地表明，这是个期盼已久的团圆之日，所有饱尝相思之苦的人们再也不必伤心流泪了。","Elaborate day and night fetes were organized, and at the same time smoke began to rise from locomotives in the station, and ships were already heading for our harbor—reminders in their divers ways that this was the long-awaited day of reuniting, and the end of tears for all who had been parted."
"人们不难想象，眼下，长久以来使众多市民内心痛苦不已的这种别离之情在这一刻会有怎样的体现。整整一天，驶入该城和离开该城的火车上都挤满了乘客。所有的乘客早就预订了这天的车票，在过去的两周时间里，人人如坐针毡，生怕在最后时刻当局会取消原来的决定。一些要来奥兰的旅客还是有些忐忑不安，尽管一般来说，他们对自己亲人的情况应该非常了解，但他们对其他人以及这座城市本身却一无所知，因而把奥兰想象得阴森恐怖。但这仅仅适用于那些在长达几个月的流放中没有伤心欲绝的人们，而不适用于那些分隔两地的情侣们。","We can easily picture, at this stage, the consequences of that feeling of separation which had so long rankled in the hearts of so many of our townsfolk.Trains coming in were as crowded as those that left the town in the course of the day.Every passenger had reserved his seat long in advance and had been on tenterhooks during the past fortnight lest at the last moment the authorities should go back on their decision.Some of these incoming travelers were still somewhat nervous; though as a rule they knew the lot of those nearest and dearest to them, they were still in the dark about others and the town itself, of which their imagination painted a grim and terrifying picture.But this applies only to people who had not been eating their hearts out during the long months of exile, and not to parted lovers."
"的确，那些情侣们完全被自己的固执想法包围着，因此，对他们而言，只有一件事发生了变化。","The lovers, indeed, were wholly wrapped up in their fixed idea, and for them one thing only had changed."
"在那几个月的分离时光里，对于他们的爱人来说，时间总是过得太慢，他们一直都盼望着时间可以过得更快些，但是，当火车开始刹车、驶入站台，奥兰已经近在眼前时，他们却又希望时间可以放慢速度，想让每一刻都停下脚步。这种感觉，也许有些困惑，但是依然心酸，这些天、这些周、这几个月以来，他们为自己的爱人失去的时光让他们隐约感觉自己有权得到某种补偿，现在这种欢乐时间应该比那些度日如年的等待时间慢上两倍。那些在家里或是在月台上等待他们的人们——朗贝尔就在月台上等着，他的妻子早已得到通知，并马上着手准备乘第一趟火车来奥兰——同样也迫不及待、心烦意乱。即使是朗贝尔，一想到自己很快就可以见到心上人，一想到好几个月以来，鼠疫已经慢慢地将柔情蜜意化为了一个苍白的概念，而自己将要与一个有血有肉的女人重温旧情，他的内心也惶惶不安起来。","Whereas during those months of separation time had never gone quickly enough for their liking and they were always wanting to speed its flight, now that they were in sight of the town they would have liked to slow it down and hold each moment in suspense, once the brakes went on and the train was entering the station.For the sensation, confused perhaps, but none the less poignant for that, of all those days and weeks and months of life lost to their love made them vaguely feel they were entitled to some compensation; this present hour of joy should run at half the speed of those long hours of waiting.And the people who awaited them at home or on the platform—among the latter Rambert, whose wife, warned in good time, had got busy at once and was coming by the first train-were likewise fretting with impatience and quivering with anxiety.For even Rambert felt a nervous tremor at the thought that soon he would have to confront a love and a devotion that the plague months had slowly refined to a pale abstraction, with the flesh-and-blood woman who had given rise to them."
"要是时光能倒流，让他做回鼠疫刚爆发时的自己该多好呀！那时的他只有一种想法、一个愿望：逃出城去，回到他深爱的女人的怀里！但他知道，现在这已是不可能的了，他已经改变了许多。这场鼠疫让他形成了一种超然的态度，尽管他想尽力摆脱，但它就像萦绕心头的无形恐惧一样挥之不去。他觉得鼠疫似乎结束得太突然了，他还来不及振作起来。幸福一下子就降临到他的头上，速度之快真是出人意料。朗贝尔知道，他曾经失去的一切都会瞬间恢复如常，而欢乐也会像烈焰一样瞬间将他包围，不会有任何耽搁。","If only he could put the clock back and be once more the man who, at the outbreak of the epidemic, had had only one thought and one desire: to escape and return to the woman he loved!But that, he knew, was out of the question now; he had changed too greatly.The plague had forced on him a detachment which, try as he might, he couldn’t think away, and which like a formless fear haunted his mind.Almost he thought the plague had ended too abruptly, he hadn’t had time to pull himself together.Happiness was bearing down on him full speed, the event outrunning expectation.Rambert understood that all would be restored to him in a flash, and joy break on him like a flame with which there is no dallying."
"实际上，月台上每个人的想法都或多或少地和朗贝尔差不多，因此这里所说的正是大家的情况。每个人都将回到各自的生活，但他们依然有种患难与共的感觉，因此他们开心地相互对视并微笑致意。不过，他们一看到越来越近的火车头冒出的浓烟，流放的感觉瞬间在一阵无可抑制的狂喜中消失得无影无踪。当火车停下来的时候，这场始于同一个月台的看似永无止境的分离在一场相聚的狂欢中结束，人们张开双臂，热情拥抱着已经生疏的对方的身体。至于朗贝尔，他还没有来得及看清那个朝他飞奔而来的身影，而她已经投入他的怀抱了。他紧紧搂住了她，她的头贴在他的肩膀上，他只能看到那一头熟悉的头发，禁不住泪流满面，不知是此刻的幸福之泪，还是一直压抑着的痛苦之泪。他只知道，泪水使他无法看清埋在他怀里的是他朝思暮想的那张脸，还是一个陌生女人的脸。此时，他想表现得跟他周围的人一样，相信或者说愿意去相信人心不会随着鼠疫的来去而发生任何变化。","Everyone indeed, more or less consciously, felt as he did, and it is of all those people on the platform that we wish to speak.Each was returning to his personal life, yet the sense of comradeship persisted and they were exchanging smiles and cheerful glances among themselves.But the moment they saw the smoke of the approaching engine, the feeling of exile vanished before an uprush of overpowering, bewildering joy.And when the train stopped, all those interminable-seeming separations which often had begun on this same platform came to an end in one ecstatic moment, when arms closed with hungry possessiveness on bodies whose living shape they had forgotten.As for Rambert, he hadn’t time to see that form running toward him; already she had flung herself upon his breast.And with his arms locked around her, pressing to his shoulder the head of which he saw only the familiar hair, he let his tears flow freely, unknowing if they rose from present joy or from sorrow too long repressed; aware only that they would prevent his making sure if the face buried in the hollow of his shoulder were the face of which he had dreamed so often or, instead, a stranger’s face.For the moment he wished to behave like all those others around him who believed, or made believe, that plague can come and go without changing anything in men’s hearts."
"他们一对对相互依偎着回到家里，忘却了外部世界，似乎战胜了鼠疫，忘却了一切悲伤，也忘却了那些同乘一列火车回来却无人迎接的人们的痛苦。这些人准备回到家里去证实他们的担忧，因为许久没有亲人的音讯，他们的心里充满了疑虑。对于上面所说的最后一类人，此刻陪伴他们的是新的悲伤，他们沉浸在对失去的亲人一生的追忆中——对这些不幸的人来说，情况则大不相同：离别之苦已经达到无以复加的地步。对这些失去了一切快乐的母亲、丈夫、妻子和恋人来说，他们的亲人要么躺在死人坑里，身上覆盖着一层生石灰，要么已经化为一掬骨灰埋在灰色的土堆中，鼠疫还没有结束。但是谁还会想到这些独自沉痛哀思的人呢？太阳驱散了清晨以来一直弥漫空中的寒气，将静谧的阳光稳稳地倾泻在这座城市上。天空呈现出清澈而凝固不动的蓝色，在山冈上的堡垒里，枪声不断轰鸣。大家倾巢而出，庆祝这激动人心的时刻：严酷考验已经结束，而遗忘还未开始。大街上，广场上，人们翩翩起舞。一天之内，街上的汽车数量大增，越来越多的车辆和狂欢的人群将街道挤得水泄不通。整个下午，所有教堂的钟声齐鸣，在阳光灿烂的蔚蓝天空中不断回响。实际上，所有的教堂都在举行着感恩仪式。而与此同时，娱乐场所也是人满为患，咖啡馆全然不顾第二天该如何营业，把最后的几瓶酒全都卖光了。每个吧台周围都是人声鼎沸，其中还有些情侣毫无顾忌地搂抱在一起。大家都在笑着，叫着。好几个月来，每个人都把热情储藏了起来，每个人都把生活的火焰压抑在心底，而在今天这个庆祝自己得以幸存的大喜日子里，大家都尽情宣泄着这种热情。明天，规规矩矩的现实生活就要重新开始了。而此时此刻，来自各行各业的人们摩肩擦踵、尽情狂欢。死亡中没能实现人人平等，而解放的欢乐终于使之实现，并高高兴兴地维持了几个小时之久。","Nestling to one another, they went to their homes, blind to the outside world and seemingly triumphant over the plague, forgetting every sadness and the plight of those who had come by the same train and found no one awaiting them, and were bracing themselves to hear in their homes a confirmation of the fear that the long silence had already implanted in their hearts.For these last, who had now for company only their new-born grief, for those who at this moment were dedicating themselves to a lifelong memory of bereavement—for these unhappy people matters were very different, the pangs of separation had touched their climax.For the mothers, husbands, wives, and lovers who had lost all joy, now that the loved one lay under a layer of quicklime in a death-pit or was a mere handful of indistinctive ashes in a gray mound, the plague had not yet ended.But who gave a thought to these lonely mourners?Routing the cold flaws that had been threshing the air since early-morning, the sun was pouring on the town a steady flood of tranquil light.In the forts on the hills, under the sky of pure, unwavering blue, guns were thundering without a break.And everyone was out and about to celebrate those crowded moments when the time of ordeal ended and the time of forgetting had not yet begun.In streets and squares people were dancing.Within twenty-four hours the motor traffic had doubled and the ever more numerous cars were held up at every turn by merry-making crowds.Every church bell was in full peal throughout the afternoon, and the bells filled the blue and gold sky with their reverberations.Indeed, in all the churches thanksgiving services were being held.But at the same time the places of entertainment were packed, and the cafes, caring nothing for the morrow, were producing their last bottles of liquor.A noisy concourse surged round every bar, including loving couples who fondled each other without a thought for appearances.All were laughing or shouting.The reserves of emotion pent up during those many months when for everybody the flame of life burned low were being recklessly squandered to celebrate this, the red-letter day of their survival.Tomorrow real life would begin again, with its restrictions.But for the moment people in very different walks of life were rubbing shoulders, fraternizing.The leveling-out that death’s imminence had failed in practice to accomplish was realized at last, for a few gay hours, in the rapture of escape."
"但这种沸沸扬扬的快乐气氛只是这座城市当天生活的一部分。黄昏时分，许多人跟朗贝尔和他的爱人一样，挤在大街上的人群之中，用一种悠然自得的神态来掩饰内心更为微妙的幸福感。的确，许多情侣，许多家人看起来只是在漫不经心地漫步，仅此而已。但事实上，他们中大部分人是在他们遭受过苦难的地方进行着感情的朝圣。他们向刚回到城里的亲人指出鼠疫留下的或明或暗的痕迹，那些鼠疫经过后的残骸。有时候，鼠疫幸存者就像个导游似的，摆出一副“经历过一切”的见证人的架势，滔滔不绝地谈论鼠疫的危险，而只字不提自己内心的恐惧。这种乐趣并不过分，不过是种消遣罢了。但是，有时候，有人在城里走着走着就流露出更加强烈的情感来，比如，有人会指着某个充满悲伤与柔情回忆之地，对他身旁的女伴说：“就是在这里，也是在这样的一个夜晚，我曾经苦苦地思念你——而你却不在！”这些热情的朝圣者是很容易辨认出来的，在喧嚣的人群中，他们窃窃私语、远离他人、旁若无人，形成了一个个的绿洲。他们表达这种获得解放的喜悦心情的方式比广场上那些乐队还要真切得多。这些欣喜若狂、紧紧依偎在一起的情侣们，尽管言语不多，却在一片欢腾的气氛之中，用他们洋洋自得、无比幸福的样子向世人宣布，鼠疫已经结束，恐怖的统治也结束了。他们不顾事实，若无其事地否认我们曾经生活在一个草菅人命的荒谬世界，否认鼠疫中确实存在过的野蛮行径和蓄意的疯狂举动，这无非是在宣扬一种离经叛道的所谓自由罢了，他们也否认我们闻到过这种令所有幸存者目瞪口呆的停尸间的恶臭。总之，他们否认我们曾经深受鼠疫的折磨，那时侯，每天都有一部分人的尸体被扔进焚化炉，最后化为一股浓烟，而其余人则束手无策地等待着死神的召唤。","But this rather tawdry exuberance was only one aspect of the town that day; not a few of those filling the streets at sundown, among them Rambert and his wife, hid under an air of calm satisfaction subtler forms of happiness.Many couples, indeed, and many families, looked like people out for a casual stroll, no more than that; in reality most of them were making sentimental pilgrimages to places where they had gone to school with suffering.The newcomers were being shown the striking or obscurer tokens of the plague, relics of its passage.In some cases the survivor merely played the part of guide, the eyewitness who has “been through it,” and talked freely of the danger without mentioning his fear.These were the milder forms of pleasure, little more than recreation.In other cases, however, there was more emotion to these walks about the town, as when a man, pointing to some place charged for him with sad yet tender associations, would say to the girl or woman beside him: “This is where, one evening just like this, I longed for you so desperately—and you weren’t there!”These passionate pilgrims could readily be distinguished; they formed oases of whispers, aloof, self-centered, in the turbulence of the crowd.Far more effectively than the bands playing in the squares they vouched for the vast joy of liberation.These ecstatic couples, locked together, hardly speaking, proclaimed in the midst of the tumult of rejoicing, with the proud egoism and injustice of happy people, that the plague was over, the reign of terror ended.Calmly they denied, in the teeth of the evidence, that we had ever known a crazy world in which men were killed off like flies, or that precise savagery, that calculated frenzy of the plague, which instilled an odious freedom as to all that was not the here and now; or those charnel-house stenches which stupefied whom they did not kill.In short, they denied that we had ever been that hag-ridden populace a part of which was daily fed into a furnace and went up in oily fumes, while the rest, in shackled impotence, waited their turn."
"不管怎样，这就是里厄当天在将近黄昏时所看到的情景，那时候，他正独自一人朝市郊走去，钟声、炮声、乐声和震耳欲聋的叫喊声不绝于耳。毫无疑问，医生是无假可休的，病人从不休假。在淡淡的、清丽的晚霞映照下，城里升腾起一股熟悉的烤肉和茴香酒的味道。在他周围，一副副幸福的面庞仰望着阳光明媚的天空，红光满面的一对对男女拥抱在一起，不时地发出低声而深情的呼唤。是的，鼠疫带着恐怖都逝去了，而这些热情的拥抱正说明了这一点：鼠疫这个词眼最深层的含义就是流放和分离。","That, anyhow, was what seemed evident to Rieux when towards the close of the afternoon, on his way to the outskirts of the town, he walked alone in an uproar of bells, guns, bands, and deafening shouts.There was no question of his taking a day off; sick men have no holidays.Through the cool, clear light bathing the town rose the familiar smells of roasting meat and anise-flavored liquor.All around him happy faces were turned toward the shining sky, men and women with flushed cheeks embraced one another with low, tense cries of desire.Yes, the plague had ended with the terror, and those passionately straining arms told what it had meant: exile and deprivation in the profoundest meaning of the words."
"里厄头一次觉得他明白了路人脸上那种亲如一家的神色，好几个月以来，他就注意到了这一点。他现在只要看看四周就清楚了。鼠疫结束了，它所带来的苦难和贫穷也结束了，这些男男女女还保留着他们长期以来所扮演的流放者角色的特征，起先是他们的脸色，而现在是他们的衣着，讲述着他们远离故土忍受长期惩罚的经历。自从鼠疫爆发、城门关闭以来，他们开始了一种与世隔绝的生活，感受不到那种令人忘却一切痛苦的人间温暖。在这座城市的每一个角落里，男男女女都曾不同程度地渴望着团聚，尽管团聚的性质各有不同，但同样都是无法实现的。他们当中大多数人都曾热切地渴望着不在身边的心上人，渴望着肉体的温暖，昔日的温存，或者只是怀念那种早已习惯的生活。有些人往往在不知不觉之中就承受了这样的痛苦：他们身边不再有朋友相伴，他们再也不能通过正常途径来与朋友保持联系——比如信件、火车和轮船。还有少数一些人——塔鲁可能就是其中一员——也曾渴望团聚，而原因却是某种他们自己也无法确定的、但认为是世上唯一值得向往的东西。因为想不出一种更好的说法，他们有时就将这东西称作“安宁”。","For the first time Rieux found that he could give a name to the family likeness that for several months he had detected in the faces in the streets.He had only to look around him now.At the end of the plague, with its misery and privations, these men and women had come to wear the aspect of the part they had been playing for so long, the part of emigrants whose faces first, and now their clothes, told of long banishment from a distant homeland.Once plague had shut the gates of the town, they had settled down to a life of separation, debarred from the living warmth that gives forgetfulness of all.In different degrees, in every part of the town, men and women had been yearning for a reunion, not of the same kind for all, but for all alike ruled out.Most of them had longed intensely for an absent one, for the warmth of a body, for love, or merely for a life that habit had endeared.Some, often without knowing it, suffered from being deprived of the company of friends and from their inability to get in touch with them through the usual channels of friendship—letters, trains, and boats.Others, fewer these—Tarrou may have been one of them—had desired reunion with something they couldn’t have defined, but which seemed to them the only desirable thing on earth.For want of a better name, they sometimes called it peace."
"里厄继续往前走。他走着走着，周围的人越聚越多，嘈杂声越来越大，而他感觉自己每往前走一步，目的地就往后退一步，似乎永远走不到尽头。渐渐地，他发现自己已经融入到这些川流不息、吵吵嚷嚷的人群之中，并越来越能理解人群中发出的呼唤声的含义，这呼唤中至少有一部分代表了他的心声。是的，人们都曾在精神上和肉体上因为难以忍受的空虚、无可挽回的流放和永远不能满足的渴望而遭受过相同的痛苦。在一堆堆尸体中间，在一阵阵救护车的车鸣声中，在以命运之名发出的警告声中，在挥之不去的恐惧气氛中，在痛苦的反抗中，以及它们化身的惊恐情绪中，这些孤立无助、惊慌失措的人们的耳边一直回荡着一阵洪亮的呐喊声，这个声音呼唤着他们去寻找他们心之所向的地方，他们的故土家园。它栖息在这座令人窒息的城市的高墙外，在山冈上芬芳的灌木丛中，在大海的波浪里，在自由的蓝天下，在爱情的呵护下。正是向往着这个迷失的家园，向往着幸福，他们一心渴望回来，对其他的一切都不管不顾。","Rieux walked on.As he progressed, the crowds grew thicker, the din multiplied, and he had a feeling that his destination was receding as he advanced.Gradually he found himself drawn into the seething, clamorous mass and understanding more and more the cry that went up from it, a cry that, for some part at least, was his.Yes, they had suffered together, in body no less than in soul, from a cruel leisure, exile without redress, thirst that was never slaked.Among the heaps of corpses, the clanging bells of ambulances, the warnings of what goes by the name of fate, among unremitting waves of fear and agonized revolt, the horror that such things could be, always a great voice had been ringing in the ears of these forlorn, panicked people, a voice calling them back to the land of their desire, a homeland.It lay outside the walls of the stifled, strangled town, in the fragrant brushwood of the hills, in the waves of the sea, under free skies, and in the custody of love.And it was to this, their lost home, toward happiness, they longed to return, turning their backs disgustedly on all else."
"至于这种流放和这种对团聚的渴望究竟有什么意义，里厄并不清楚。但他继续向前走着，周围推推搡搡，偶尔交谈几句，渐渐地走到了行人较为稀少的街道上。这一路上，他在想，这些事情是否有意义并不重要，我们只需知道这带给人们希望就够了。现在他已找到了这个问题的答案，而当他在市郊这些几乎人迹罕至的街道上行走时，他对这个问题就看得更清楚了。那些恋恋不忘自己的爱人、一心只想回到自己的爱情乐园的人有的已经如愿以偿——尽管他们中间也有些人失去了自己苦苦等待的亲人，依然孤身一人在街上徘徊。不过，那些没有遭受过双重分离之苦的人还是幸运的，他们不像某些人那样，在鼠疫发生前的日子里，一开始就没能建立起牢固的爱情，后来又花费了多年时间盲目地追求表面的和平，磨磨蹭蹭，艰难地凑合着生活，以至最终变成了一对怨偶。这些人就像里厄自己一样，曾经轻率地相信一切都可以靠时间来解决，而现在暂别成了永诀。但另一些人——如朗贝尔，医生在这天早晨对他说：“拿出勇气来！现在是你证明自己正确的时候了”——毫不犹豫地把原以为已经失去的亲人重新拥入了怀中。至少在一段时间里，他们会很幸福。现在他们知道，假如世上有样东西可以让人们永远向往并有可能得到它，那就是人类的爱。但对于那些超越普通的人类情感、追求某种连他们自己也无法想象的东西的人来说，他们并没有如愿。塔鲁也许已经得到了他曾经说过的那种难觅的安宁，但他只是在死时才得到了安宁，而那时安宁已没有意义了。不过，其他人已经如愿以偿——在落日的余辉下，里厄看见他们在家门口热情相拥、深情凝视——因为他们所追求的是他们自己力所能及的东西。当里厄拐进格朗和科塔尔所住的那条街道时，他在想，确实应该让那些只想着亲人和那可怜却又可敬的爱情的人们得到欢乐的奖赏，即使偶尔如此也好。","As to what that exile and that longing for reunion meant, Rieux had no idea.But as he walked ahead, jostled on all sides, accosted now and then, and gradually made his way into less crowded streets, he was thinking it has no importance whether such things have or have not a meaning; all we need consider is the answer given to men’s hope.Henceforth he knew the answer, and he perceived it better now he was in the outskirts of the town, in almost empty streets.Those who, clinging to their little own, had set their hearts solely on returning to the home of their love had sometimes their reward—though some of them were still walking the streets alone, without the one they had awaited.Then, again, those were happy who had not suffered a twofold separation, like some of us who, in the days before the epidemic, had failed to build their love on a solid basis at the outset, and had spent years blindly groping for the pact, so slow and hard to come by, that in the long run binds together ill-assorted lovers.Such people had had, like Rieux himself, the rashness of counting overmuch on time; and now they were parted forever.But others—like Rambert, to whom the doctor had said early that morning: “Courage! It’s up to you now to prove you’re right”—had, without faltering, welcomed back the loved one who they thought was lost to them.And for some time, anyhow, they would be happy.They knew now that if there is one thing one can always yearn for and sometimes attain, it is human love.But for those others who aspired beyond and above the human individual toward something they could not even imagine, there had been no answer.Tarrou might seem to have won through to that hardly-come-by peace of which he used to speak; but he had found it only in death, too late to turn it to account.If others, however—Rieux could see them in the doorways of houses, passionately embracing and gazing hungrily at one another in the failing sunset glow—had got what they wanted, this was because they had asked for the one thing that depended on them solely.And as he turned the corner of the street where Grand and Cottard lived, Rieux was thinking it was only right that those whose desires are limited to man and his humble yet formidable love should enter, if only now and then, into their reward."
"第二十九章","Chapter 29"
"这部记事已接近尾声，看来也该是里厄医生承认自己是该书作者的时候了。但在记录最后的一些场景之前，他至少想说明一下他写该书的理由，以及他特别注重以一个客观见证人的语气来进行叙述。在鼠疫肆虐的日子里，他的职业使他接触到该城的许多市民，也让他有机会听到他们的各种观点。因此他完全有资格来真实记录下他的所见所闻。不过，他在整个叙述过程中还是尽力保持在看起来是可获得的范围之内。比如，总的说来，他叙述的都是些自己亲眼所见的事情，而且从不把一些无中生有的想法强加在他那些深受鼠疫折磨的同胞们身上。而且他的写作素材仅仅来源于他所掌握的那些偶然事件或不幸事件。因为他被要求要为一种罪行作证，他表现出一个有良知的证人该有的谨慎。同时，他听从自己内心的召唤，有意识地站在了受害者一边，并试着与市民们一起分享着他们唯一的共同信念——爱情、流放和痛苦。因此，他可以大言不惭地说，他分担了他们的一切忧虑，他们的困境也就是他的困境。","This chronicle is drawing to an end, and this seems to be the moment for Dr. Bernard Rieux to confess that he is the narrator.But before describing the closing scenes, he would wish anyhow to justify his undertaking and to set it down that he expressly made a point of adopting the tone of an impartial observer.His profession put him in touch with a great many of our townspeople while plague was raging, and he had opportunities of hearing their various opinions.Thus he was well placed for giving a true account of all he saw and heard.But in so doing he has tried to keep within the limits that seemed desirable.For instance, in a general way he has confined himself to describing only such things as he was enabled to see for himself, and has refrained from attributing to his fellow sufferers thoughts that, when all is said and done, they were not bound to have.And as for documents, he has used only such as chance, or mischance, put in his way.Summoned to give evidence regarding what was a sort of crime, he has exercised the restraint that behooves a conscientious witness.All the same, following the dictates of his heart, he has deliberately taken the victims’ side and tried to share with his fellow citizens the only certitudes they had in common—love, exile, and suffering.Thus he can truly say there was not one of their anxieties in which he did not share, no predicament of theirs that was not his."
"作为一个忠实的见证人，他要做的主要就是将人们的言行和文献中收集到的资料记录下来。至于他的个人困境和他的长期焦虑，他的职责让他对此保持沉默。即使他偶尔提到一些，那也只是为了使人们了解这些市民，同时也是为了尽可能描绘和定义出人们经常感到困惑的东西。事实上，这种自我节制并没有耗费他多大精力。每当他想要在成千上万的鼠疫患者的呻吟声中发出自己的声音时，他就会尽力忍住，因为他会想到自己的所有痛苦别人都经受过，还会想到以前往往是一个人独自悲伤，但现在世人都同病相怜，这是件好事。因此，毫无疑问，他应该代表大家说话。","To be an honest witness, it was for him to confine himself mainly to what people did or said and what could be gleaned from documents.Regarding his personal troubles and his long suspense, his duty was to hold his peace.When now and then he refers to such matters, it is only for the light they may throw on his fellow citizens and in order to give a picture, as well defined as possible, of what most of the time they felt confusedly.Actually, this self-imposed reticence cost him little effort.Whenever tempted to add his personal note to the myriad voices of the plague-stricken, he was deterred by the thought that not one of his sufferings but was common to all the others and that in a world where sorrow is so often lonely, this was an advantage.Thus, decidedly, it was up to him to speak for all."
"但至少有一位市民，里厄是不能代表他说话的，而塔鲁曾经对里厄说起过这个人：“他唯一的真正罪行就是他曾经发自内心赞同某种杀戮男人、女人和孩子的东西。其他事情我都能理解，唯有此事，我是不会原谅他的。”这个人愚昧无知，或者说内心孤独，而这部记事在写了此人之后就该结束了。","But there was at least one of our townsfolk for whom Dr. Rieux could not speak, the man of whom Tarrou said one day to Rieux: “His only real crime is that of having in his heart approved of something that killed off men, women, and children.I can understand the rest, but for that I am obliged to pardon him.”It is fitting that this chronicle should end with some reference to that man, who had an ignorant, that is to say lonely, heart."
"里厄医生正要离开那一片欢腾的主干道，拐入格朗和科塔尔所住的那条街道时，一道警戒线挡住了他的去路。这令他大吃一惊。","On turning out of the main thoroughfares where the rejoicings were in full swing, and entering the street where Grand and Cottard lived, Dr. Rieux was held up by a police cordon.Nothing could have surprised him more."
"在远方传来的狂欢声的衬托下，这个寂静的地区显得更加沉寂，医生觉得这里不但安静，而且荒僻。","This quiet part of the town seemed all the quieter for the sounds of festivity in the distance, and the doctor pictured it as deserted as it was tranquil."
"“对不起，医生，”警察说，“但我不能让你过去。有个疯子正拿着枪，见人就射。不过你最好呆在这里，我们可能需要你帮忙。”","“Sorry, doctor,” a policeman said, “but I can’t let you through.There’s a crazy fellow with a gun, shooting at everybody.But you’d better stay; we may need you.”"
"就在这时，里厄看见格朗朝他走了过来。格朗也不清楚到底发生了什么，而警察同样也把他给拦住了。他听说子弹是从他所住的那栋房子里射出来的。顺着街道望过去，里厄和格朗可以看见那栋房子的正面正沐浴在淡淡的晚霞中。街道的另一头拉起了另一道警戒线，它与挡住他们去路的这条警戒线遥遥相对。在那条警戒线后还可以看到几个当地居民在大街上匆匆忙忙地来回穿梭。那栋房子正前方的街道上空无一人，空旷的街道中央有一顶帽子和一块脏布。再仔细一看，他们还看到一些警察拿着左轮手枪躲在那栋房子对面的一些门道里。格朗所住的那栋房子的百叶窗全都关着，只有三楼的一扇百叶窗像是半开着。街上鸦雀无声，只能偶尔听到从市中心传来的几声音乐。","Just then Rieux saw Grand coming toward him.Grand, too, had no idea what was happening and the police had stopped him, too.He had been told that the shots came from the house where he lived.They could see, some way down the street, the front of the house, bathed in cool evening light.Farther down the street was another line of policemen like the one that had prevented Rieux and Grand from advancing, and behind the line some of the local residents could be seen crossing and recrossing the street hastily.The street immediately in front of the house was quite empty and in the middle of the hollow square lay a hat and a piece of dirty cloth.Looking more carefully, they saw more policemen, revolver in hand, sheltering in doorways facing the house.All the shutters in Grand’s house were closed, except one on the third floor that seemed to be hanging loose on one hinge only.Not a sound could be heard in the street but for occasional snatches of music coming from the center of the town."
"突然响起了两声枪响，枪声是从那栋房子对面的屋子里发出的，那扇半开的百叶窗顿时碎片纷飞。接着又一切归于平静。里厄远远地看着这一幕，在一天的喧闹过后，他感觉一切都难以置信，就像是在梦里一般。“那是科塔尔的窗户，”格朗突然大叫起来，“我看不清楚。我以为他失踪了呢。”","Suddenly two revolver-shots rang out; they came from one of the buildings opposite and some splinters flew off the dismantled shutter.Then silence came again.Seen from a distance, after the tumult of the day, the whole business seemed to Rieux fantastically unreal, like something in a dream.“That’s Cottard’s window,” Grand suddenly exclaimed.“I can’t make it out.I thought he’d disappeared.”"
"“你们为什么开枪呢？”里厄问警察。","“Why are they shooting?” Rieux asked the policeman."
"“哦，只是为了拖住他。我们正在等着车子运来必要的装备。只要有人想从正门进屋，他就会开枪射击。刚才他已经击中了一名警察。”","“Oh, just to keep him busy.We’re waiting for a car to come with the stuff that’s needed.He fires at anyone who tries to get in by the front door.He got one of our men just now.”"
"“那他为什么要开枪呢？”","“But why did he fire?”"
"“谁知道呀！一些人正在街上游玩，他就朝他们开枪了。起初他们还摸不着头脑。等到他再次开枪射击时，他们开始大声叫喊起来，一个人受了伤，其他人则逃之夭夭。我得说，他就是个疯子。”","“Ask me another!Some folks were having fun in the street, and he let off at them.They couldn’t make it out at first.When he fired again, they started yelling, one man was wounded, and the rest took to their heels.Some fellow out of his head, I should say.”"
"四周又恢复了寂静，一分钟一分钟，似乎漫无尽头。接着，他们发现在街道的另一头出现了一条肮脏的西班牙猎狗，这是好几个月以来里厄看见的第一条狗，它的主人可能一直都把它藏着。它沿着墙缓缓走来，在那栋房子的门口停了下来，一屁股坐下，接着就开始咬身上的跳蚤。有几个警察吹着哨子想让它走开。它抬起头来，然后走到马路中间去嗅那顶帽子，这时从三楼窗户传来一声枪响。那条狗被击中了，它像烙煎饼一样翻了个个儿，四脚朝天抖动着，又挣扎着侧身倒下，浑身抽搐了好一会儿。警察从对面的屋子里射出了五六发子弹作为回击，那扇百叶窗爆裂为更多的碎片。接着，四周又安静了下来。太阳又落下去一些，阴影开始接近科塔尔的窗户。在大街上，从医生身后传来一阵低沉的刹车声。","The minutes seemed interminable in the silence that had returned.Then they noticed a dog, the first dog Rieux had seen for many months, emerging on the other side of the street, a draggled-looking spaniel that its owners had, presumably, kept in hiding.It ambled along the wall, stopped in the doorway, sat down, and began to dig at its fleas.Some of the policemen whistled for it to come away.It raised its head, then walked out into the road and was sniffing at the hat when a revolver barked from the third-floor window.The dog did a somersault like a tossed pancake, lashed the air with its legs, and floundered on to its side, its body writhing in long convulsions.As if by way of reprisal five or six shots from the opposite house knocked more splinters off the shutter.Then silence fell again.The sun had moved a little and the shadow-line was nearing Cottard’s window.There was a low squeal of brakes in the street, behind the doctor."
"“他们到了。”警察说。","“Here they are,” the policeman said."
"许多警察跳下车，从车上卸下几卷绳索、一个梯子和两个用油布包着的长方形大包裹。接着，他们转身进入了格朗那栋房子对面那排房屋后的一条街道。过了一会儿，那排房屋的门道里似乎传来一阵骚动，尽管几乎看不到里面的情况。又过了一小会儿。那条狗已经不动弹了，它现在正躺在一小滩暗红色的、闪闪发光的血泊之中。","A number of police officers jumped out of the car and unloaded coils of rope, a ladder, and two big oblong packages wrapped in oilcloth.Then they turned into a street behind the row of houses facing Grand’s.A minute or so later there were signs of movement, though little could be seen, in the doorways of the houses.Then came a short spell of waiting.The dog had ceased moving; it now was lying in a small, dark, glistening pool."
"突然，从警察翻身进入的一幢房屋的窗户里发出一阵机关枪的枪声。警察继续瞄准那扇百叶窗射击，百叶窗被完全击碎了，成了一个黑暗的大窟窿，里厄和格朗站在原地根本无法看到屋里的状况。头一阵机关枪扫射刚停了下来，在距离稍远些的一幢房屋里，又有一挺机关枪从另一个角度开始了扫射。子弹显然直接打中了窗框，有块碎砖头哗啦一声砸落在人行道上。与此同时，三位警察迅速穿过马路，消失在大门里。","Suddenly from the window of one of the houses that the police officers had entered from behind there came a burst of machine-gun fire.They were still aiming at the shutter, which literally shredded itself away, disclosing a dark gap into which neither Grand nor Rieux could see from where they stood.When the first machine-gun stopped firing, another opened up from a different angle, in a house a little farther up the street.The shots were evidently directed into the window space, and a fragment of the brickwork clattered down upon the pavement.At the same moment three police officers charged across the road and disappeared into the doorway."
"机关枪停止了射击，又过了一会儿。屋子里响起了两声沉闷的爆炸声，接着是一阵越来越响的嘈杂声，一个穿着衬衣、大声尖叫的矮个子从大门口被拖了出来，或者说更像是被抬了出来。仿佛是收到了期待的信号一般，街道两旁的所有百叶窗不约而同地全都打开了，窗口处露出了一张张兴奋的脸庞，而另一群人则涌出家门，挤在两条警戒线之间。里厄瞥了一眼那个矮个子，他现在被拖到了马路中央，双脚着地，两只胳臂被两位警察拧在背后。他还在不停地尖叫着。一位警察走上前去，非常冷静地狠狠揍了他两拳，十足的职业风范。","The machine-gun ceased fire.Then came another wait.Two muffled detonations sounded inside the house, followed by a confused hubbub growing steadily louder until they saw a small man in his shirt-sleeves, screaming at the top of his voice, being carried more than dragged out by the doorway.As if at an expected signal all the shutters in the street flew open and excited faces lined the windows, while people streamed out of the houses and jostled the lines of police.Rieux had a brief glimpse of the small man, on his feet now, in the middle of the road, his arms pinioned behind him by two police officers.He was still screaming.A policeman went up and dealt him two hard blows with his fists, quite calmly, with a sort of conscientious thoroughness."
"“那是科塔尔！”格朗激动得尖叫着说，“他已经疯了！”","“It’s Cottard!”Grand’s voice was shrill with excitement.“He’s gone mad!”"
"科塔尔仰面倒下，而那位警察又朝这个伸开四肢瘫在地上的人狠狠地踢了一脚。这时，人群一阵骚动，开始朝医生和他的老朋友走了过来。","Cottard had fallen backwards, and the policeman launched a vigorous kick into the crumpled mass sprawling on the ground.Then a small, surging group began to move toward the doctor and his old friend."
"“让开！”警察喊道。","“Stand clear!” the policeman bawled."
"当人群、科塔尔和抓他的警察从里厄身边走过时，里厄把目光移开了。","Rieux looked away when the group, Cottard and his captors, passed him."
"夜色越来越浓，格朗和医生终于也动身了。科塔尔事件好像已经把这个地区从以前的昏睡状态中摇醒了似的，这些偏僻的街道也开始热闹起来，到处挤满了狂欢的人们。格朗在他家门口向医生道别，他说，他要去做晚上的工作了。正要上楼时，他又对医生说，他已经给珍妮写了信，所以他感觉更开心了。他还说自己已重新改写了那个句子：“我已经删去了所有的形容词。”接着，他眼睛一亮，脱下帽子，温文尔雅地把它放在胸前鞠了一躬。但里厄还在想着科塔尔，在去往那位老气喘病人家的路上，他的耳边一直回荡着拳头打在可怜的科塔尔脸上所发出的那种沉闷的声音。也许，想起一个有罪之人比想起一个死去的人更难受。","The dusk was thickening into night when Grand and the doctor made a move at last.The Cottard incident seemed to have shaken the neighborhood out of its normal lethargy and even these remote streets were becoming crowded with noisy merry-makers.On his doorstep Grand bade the doctor good night; he was going to put in an evening’s work, he said.Just as he was starting up the stairs he added that he’d written to Jeanne and was feeling much happier.Also he’d made a fresh start with his phrase.“I’ve cut out all the adjectives.”And, with a twinkle in his eye, he took his hat off, bringing it low in a courtly sweep.But Rieux was thinking of Cottard, and the dull thud of fists belaboring the wretched man’s face haunted him as he went to visit his old asthma patient.Perhaps it was more painful to think of a guilty man than of a dead man."
"等里厄到达病人家时，天色已经完全黑了。卧室里还能隐约听见从远方传来的人们庆祝重获自由的喧闹声，而老人依然像往常一样，正把干豆从一个锅里移到另一个锅里。","It was quite dark by the time he reached his patient’s house.In the bedroom the distant clamor of a populace rejoicing in its new-won freedom could be faintly heard, and the old fellow was as usual transposing peas from one pan to another."
"“人们就该高兴高兴，”他说，“俗话说，世界之大，无奇不有。医生，你那位同事呢？他过得怎样？”","“They’re quite right to amuse themselves,” he said.“It takes all sorts to make a world, as they say.And your colleague, doctor, how’s he getting on?”"
"“他死了。”医生一边说着一边为他的病人呼呼作响的胸部作听诊。","“He’s dead.” Rieux was listening to his patient’s rumbling chest."
"“啊，真的吗？”听起来老人有些尴尬。","“Ah, really?”The old fellow sounded embarrassed."
"“死于鼠疫。”里厄补充道。","“Of plague,” Rieux added."
"“哦，”老人沉默了一会儿接着说，“好人总是先死。这就是生活。不过，他是个知道自己想要什么的人。”　　　　　","“Yes,” the old man said after a moment’s silence, “it’s always the best who go.That’s how life is.But he was a man who knew what he wanted.”"
"“你为什么这样说呢？”医生一边问一边放好他的听诊器。","“Why do you say that?”The doctor was putting back his stethoscope."
"“哦，也没什么特别的原因。只不过——对，他说话从不信口开河。我很喜欢他。事情就是这样！人们都说：‘这就是鼠疫。我们都经历过这场鼠疫。’看来他们都想着要被授予勋章了。但‘鼠疫’又有什么含义呢？就是生活，仅此而已。”","“Oh, for no particular reason.Only—well, he never talked just for talking’s sake.I’d rather cottoned to him.But there you are!All those folks are saying: ‘It was plague.We’ve had the plague here.’ You’d almost think they expected to be given medals for it.But what does that mean—‘plague’?Just life, no more than that.”"
"“你要定期做做熏蒸疗法。”","“Do your inhalations regularly.”"
"“请放心，医生！我还要活上好些时间，我还要看着别人被一个个送进坟墓。我知道该怎么活。”","“Don’t worry about me, doctor!There’s lots of life in me yet, and I’ll see ’em all into their graves.I know how to live.”"
"远处突然传来的一阵欢呼声，似乎与老人的自吹自擂遥相呼应。医生走到屋子中央停了下来。","A burst of joyful shouts in the distance seemed an echo of his boast.Halfway across the room the doctor halted."
"“我想到露台上去，你不介意吧？”","“Would you mind if I go up on the terrace?”"
"“当然不介意了。你想到上面去看看那些人——对吧？不过，人们确实还是跟以前一样。”当里厄正要出门时，老人的脑海里突然闪过一个新的念头，于是他说：“喂，医生。他们真的要为那些死于鼠疫的人们立一座纪念碑吗？”","“Of course not.You’d like to have a look at ’em—that it?But they’re just the same as ever, really.”When Rieux was leaving the room, a new thought crossed his mind.“I say, doctor.Is it a fact they’re going to put up a memorial to the people who died of plague?”"
"“报纸上是这样说的。立一座纪念碑，或立一块纪念牌。”","“So the papers say.A monument, or just a tablet.”"
"“我早就料到了！还会有人演讲。”他声音嘶哑地笑着。“我几乎可以听到他们在说：‘我们已故的……’说完，他们转身就去大吃一顿。”","“I could have sworn it!And there’ll be speeches.”He chuckled throatily.“I can almost hear them saying: ‘Our dear departed...’ And then they’ll go off and have a good snack.”"
"里厄走到了楼梯半中央。头顶上寒冷而深邃的夜空繁星闪烁，在山顶上空，星星看上去就像燧石一般坚硬。今夜与那个他和塔鲁登上露台、忘却鼠疫的夜晚极为相似。只不过，今天晚上，海浪拍击悬崖的声音更加响亮，空气中没有风、无比清新，根本闻不到秋风所带来的海水味。来自城里的喧哗声依然像海浪一般冲击着这一长排露台，但今晚它们象征的不是反抗，而是解放。远处，市中心的林阴大道和广场上空已被染成了淡红色。在这个重获自由的夜晚，人们尽情表达着自己的心愿，而现在，里厄听到的正是这些心愿所会聚成的喧闹声。","Rieux was already halfway up the stairs.Cold, fathomless depths of sky glimmered overhead, and near the hilltops stars shone hard as flint.It was much like the night when he and Tarrou had come to the terrace to forget the plague.Only, tonight the sea was breaking on the cliffs more loudly and the air was calm and limpid, free of the tang of brine the autumn wind had brought.The noises of the town were still beating like waves at the foot of the long line of terraces, but tonight they told not of revolt, but of deliverance.In the distance a reddish glow hung above the big central streets and squares.In this night of new-born freedom desires knew no limits, and it was their clamor that reached Rieux’s ears."
"从黑暗的港口上空升腾起市政府燃放的第一批烟花，全城都长舒了一口气，为之欢呼喝彩。科塔尔、塔鲁以及里厄曾经爱过却已失去的人们都被遗忘了——无论是死去的人，还是有罪之人，所有人都被遗忘了。","From the dark harbor soared the first rocket of the firework display organized by the municipality, and the town acclaimed it with a long-drawn sigh of delight.Cottard, Tarrou, the men and the woman Rieux had loved and lost—all alike, dead or guilty, were forgotten."
"是的，那位老人说得对，人们确实还是“跟以前一样”。他们依然精力充沛、单纯无知，里厄站在这样的高度上，忘却了一切悲痛，觉得自己已经与他们融为了一体。听着从市中心传来的一阵阵越来越响亮、越来越持久的欢呼声，看着夜空中绽放得越来越密集的五颜六色的烟花，他决定编写这部记事，因为他不该沉默不语，而应该为那些鼠疫患者作证。他要让人们永远记住那些鼠疫患者所遭受的不公与凌辱，他要简单明了地告诉人们在鼠疫中所学到的东西：人身上值得赞赏之处远多于应受鄙视之处。","Yes, the old fellow had been right; these people were “just the same as ever.”But this was at once their strength and their innocence, and it was on this level, beyond all grief, that Rieux could feel himself at one with them.And it was in the midst of shouts rolling against the terrace wall in massive waves that waxed in volume and duration, while cataracts of colored fire fell thicker through the darkness, that Dr. Rieux resolved to compile this chronicle, so that he should not be one of those who hold their peace but should bear witness in favor of those plague-stricken people; so that some memorial of the injustice and outrage done them might endure; and to state quite simply what we learn in a time of pestilence: that there are more things to admire in men than to despise."
"不过，他知道他所写的这部记事不可能是最终的胜利。它只不过记录下了人们曾经不得不做的事情，以及今后再次面对无穷无尽的恐怖和残酷屠杀之时，那些尽管当不了圣人，却拒绝向瘟疫屈服、不顾个人痛苦、竭尽全力要做个医者的人们一定会做些什么。","None the less, he knew that the tale he had to tell could not be one of a final victory.It could be only the record of what had had to be done, and what assuredly would have to be done again in the never ending fight against terror and its relentless onslaughts, despite their personal afflictions, by all who, while unable to be saints but refusing to bow down to pestilences, strive their utmost to be healers."
"而且，实际上，里厄倾听着城市上空不断回响的欢呼声，心中却没有忘记：这种欢乐总是面临着威胁。他知道，这些兴高采烈的人群是看不到一些东西的，但他们本可以从书上学到这些：鼠疫杆菌永远不会消亡，它能在家具和亚麻织物中蛰伏很多年；它会在卧室、地窖、皮箱和书架里耐心等候；也许有朝一日，为了毁灭和教训人类，瘟神又会发动它的鼠群，把某一座幸福之城变成死亡之地。","And, indeed, as he listened to the cries of joy rising from the town, Rieux remembered that such joy is always imperiled.He knew what those jubilant crowds did not know but could have learned from books: that the plague bacillus never dies or disappears for good; that it can lie dormant for years and years in furniture and linen-chests; that it bides its time in bedrooms, cellars, trunks, and bookshelves; and that perhaps the day would come when, for the bane and the enlightening of men, it would rouse up its rats again and send them forth to die in a happy city."
