"第一章 对奥利弗·特威斯特的出生地点和出生详情的描写","CHAPTER I Treats of the place where Oliver Twist was born and of the circumstances attending his birth "
"在某一个小镇，因为很多原因，出于谨慎，本文会避免提及它的名字，我也不会给它取假名。在镇上的公共建筑物之中，这个小镇也像大多数大大小小的城镇那样，有一座古老的建筑：那就是济贫院。这章标题中提到了名字的那个人就出生在这个济贫院里，具体的日期我毋需赘述，因为在事情的这个阶段，这对读者来说并不重要。","Among other public buildings in a certain town, which for many reasons it will be prudent to refrain from mentioning, and to which I will assign no fictitious name, there is one anciently common to most towns, great or small: to wit, a workhouse;and in this workhouse was born; on a day and date which I need not trouble myself to repeat, inasmuch as it can be of no possible consequence to the reader, in this stage of the business at all events; the item of mortality whose name is prefixed to the head of this chapter."
"在这孩子由教区的外科医生领到这个满是悲哀和动乱的世界后，很长一段时间里，人们一直有一个很大的疑虑，不知道这孩子能否存活到有个名字的时候。若是这样，这本传记就极有可能永无面世之日了。或者，即使传记面世了，也不过只有几页纸，这却会有一个无法估量的优点，即成为各国各时代现存文献中最简明最忠实的传记范本。","For a long time after it was ushered into this world of sorrow and trouble, by the parish surgeon, it remained a matter of considerable doubt whether the child would survive to bear any name at all; in which case it is somewhat more than probable that these memoirs would never have appeared;or, if they had, that being comprised within a couple of pages, they would have possessed the inestimable merit of being the most concise and faithful specimen of biography, extant in the literature of any age or country."
"尽管我无意坚持认为，出生在济贫院本身就是降临在一个人身上的最幸运、最令人羡慕的境遇，但我确实想说，在这个特定情况下，对奥利弗·特威斯特来说，这可能是最好的事情了。事实上，要使奥利弗自己承担呼吸的职责都是相当大的难题——呼吸是个麻烦事，习惯却使之成为我们维持最基本的生存必不可少的事情。有一段时间，他躺在一块小棉垫上喘着气，在今生和来世之间徘徊不定：天平明显地向后者倾斜。此刻，在这段短暂的时间里，如果奥利弗身边围着一班小心仔细的奶奶、担心焦虑的婶娘、经验丰富的保姆和学识渊博的医生，他必定不可避免地马上就被弄死了，这一点明确无疑。然而，他周围没有别人，只有一个贫民老太婆，她已经让平常不大容易弄到的啤酒搞得晕晕乎乎了，还有一位按合同处理这类事情的教区外科医生。奥利弗和造化展开了斗争。结果是，几次挣扎之后，奥利弗开始呼吸了，打了个喷嚏，开始向济贫院的同胞们宣告一个事实，即教区又被强加上了一个新的负担。这个宣告是通过一阵啼哭发出的，这啼哭和可以想见的一个男婴该有的哭声一样响亮，而他在之前远远超过三分十五秒的一段时间里，还不曾拥有嗓音这种非常有用的配件。","Although I am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a workhouse, is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance that can possibly befall a human being, I do mean to say that in this particular instance, it was the best thing for Oliver Twist that could by possibility have occurred.The fact is, that there was considerable difficulty in inducing Oliver to take upon himself the office of respiration,—a troublesome practice, but one which custom has rendered necessary to our easy existence; and for some time he lay gasping on a little flock mattress, rather unequally poised between this world and the next: the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter.Now, if, during this brief period, Oliver had been surrounded by careful grandmothers, anxious aunts, experienced nurses, and doctors of profound wisdom, he would most inevitably and indubitably have been killed in no time.There being nobody by, however, but a pauper old woman, who was rendered rather misty by an unwonted allowance of beer; and a parish surgeon who did such matters by contract; Oliver and Nature fought out the point between them.The result was, that, after a few struggles, Oliver breathed, sneezed, and proceeded to advertise to the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been imposed upon the parish, by setting up as loud a cry as could reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been possessed of that very useful appendage, a voice, for a much longer space of time than three minutes and a quarter."
"奥利弗以此初次证明了他的肺部完全正常，运转自如。铁床架上胡乱搭着一张缀满补丁的床单，此刻飒飒地响了起来，一个年轻女子从枕头上无力地抬起她苍白的脸，用微弱的声音含含糊糊地吐出几个字：“让我看看孩子再死吧。”","As Oliver gave this first proof of the free and proper action of his lungs, the patchwork coverlet which was carelessly flung over the iron bedstead, rustled; the pale face of a young woman was raised feebly from the pillow; and a faint voice imperfectly articulated the words, “Let me see the child, and die.”"
"外科医生面对炉火坐着：一会儿烤烤手掌，一会儿搓搓手心。听见年轻女子说话，他站起来，走向床头，用出人意料的和善语气说：“噢，你可还不能说到死。”","The surgeon had been sitting with his face turned towards the fire: giving the palms of his hands a warm and a rub alternately.As the young woman spoke, he rose, and advancing to the bed’s head, said, with more kindness than might have been expected of him: “Oh, you must not talk about dying yet.”"
"“上帝保佑她，她可不能死！”护士插话，慌忙把一只绿色玻璃瓶放到衣袋里，她已经在角落里品尝过里面的东西了，显然非常满意。","“Lor bless her dear heart, no!” interposed the nurse, hastily depositing in her pocket a green glass bottle, the contents of which she had been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction."
"“上帝保佑她，等她活到我这个岁数，先生，自己有了十三个孩子，死了十一个，只剩下两个活着，跟我一起住在济贫院里，她就会知道犯不着这样了，上帝保佑她！想想怎么当妈吧，可爱的小羊羔在这儿呢。”","“Lor bless her dear heart, when she has lived as long as I have, sir, and had thirteen children of her own, and all on ’em dead except two, and them in the wurkus with me, she’ll know better than to take on in that way, bless her dear heart!Think what it is to be a mother, there’s a dear young lamb do.”"
"显然这番对做母亲的前景展望没有达到应有的慰藉效果。病人摇了摇头，朝孩子伸出手。","Apparently this consolatory perspective of a mother’s prospects failed in producing its due effect.The patient shook her head, and stretched out her hand towards the child."
"外科医生把孩子放到她怀里。她深情地用冰冷苍白的双唇吻孩子的额头，然后用手摸了摸自己的脸，失魂落魄地环视周围，一阵战栗，向后一倒——死了。他们摩擦她的胸口、双手和太阳穴，但是她的血液已永远停止了流动。他们说了一些希望和安慰的话。这已经许久没有出现过了。","The surgeon deposited it in her arms.She imprinted her cold white lips passionately on its forehead; passed her hands over her face; gazed wildly round; shuddered; fell back—and died.They chafed her breast, hands, and temples; but the blood had stopped forever.They talked of hope and comfort.They had been strangers too long."
"“一切都结束了，辛格密太太！”外科医生最后说。“啊，可怜的孩子，就是这样了！”护士一边说着，一边捡起她弯腰抱孩子时掉在枕头上的绿瓶子的软木塞。“可怜的孩子！”","“It’s s all over, Mrs. Thingummy!” said the surgeon at last.“Ah, poor dear, so it is!” said the nurse, picking up the cork of the green bottle, which had fallen out on the pillow, as she stooped to take up the child.“Poor dear!”"
"“护士，如果孩子哭了，你大可放心差人叫我。”医生边说边从容地戴上手套，“极有可能这孩子会很烦人。他要闹起来了，就给他喂点稀粥。”他戴上帽子朝门口走去，在床边停下，又说：“她还真是个漂亮姑娘，她从哪儿来的？”","“You needn’t mind sending up to me, if the child cries, nurse,” said the surgeon, putting on his gloves with great deliberation.“It’s very likely it will be troublesome.Give it a little gruel if it is.”He put on his hat, and, pausing by the bed-side on his way to the door, added, “She was a good-looking girl, too; where did she come from?”"
"“她是昨晚被送过来的，”老太婆回答，“是救济委员的吩咐。有人发现她倒在街上。她走了很远的路，鞋子都磨成片了。但是没人知道她是从哪儿来的，要到哪儿去。”","“She was brought here last night,” replied the old woman, “by the overseer’s order.She was found lying in the street.She had walked some distance, for her shoes were worn to pieces; but where she came from, or where she was going to, nobody knows.”"
"外科医生俯下身，抬起死者的左手。“老套的故事了，”他摇摇头说，“没有结婚戒指，我明白了。啊！晚安！”","The surgeon leaned over the body, and raised the left hand.“The old story,” he said, shaking his head: “no wedding-ring, I see.Ah!Good-night!”"
"懂医术的绅士去吃晚饭了，而护士又一次抱着绿瓶子享用了一番，在炉火前的矮椅子上坐下，开始给婴儿穿衣服。","The medical gentleman walked away to dinner; and the nurse, having once more applied herself to the green bottle, sat down on a low chair before the fire, and proceeded to dress the infant."
"小奥利弗·特威斯特可真是人靠衣装的出色典范呐！他被包在毯子里，那是迄今为止他唯一的蔽体之物，如此一来他既可能是贵族家的子弟，也可能是乞丐家的孩子。就是最傲慢的陌生人也很难确定他的社会地位。但是现在他给包在了由于多次使用已经变黄了的旧白布袍子里，就已经被打上了标记，贴上了标签，立刻得到了身份——一个教区的孩子——济贫院的孤儿——卑下的半饥半饱的苦力——在世上挨巴掌，吃拳头——所有人轻视，没有人怜悯。","What an excellent example of the power of dress, young Oliver Twist was!Wrapped in the blanket which had hitherto formed his only covering, he might have been the child of a nobleman or a beggar; it would have been hard for the haughtiest stranger to have assigned him his proper station in society.But now that he was enveloped in the old calico robes which had grown yellow in the same service, he was badged and ticketed, and fell into his place at once—a parish child—the orphan of a workhouse—the humble, half-starved drudge—to be cuffed and buffeted through the world—despised by all, and pitied by none."
"奥利弗起劲地哭起来。要是他能意识到自己是个孤儿，命运全仰仗教区委员和救济委员的体贴仁慈，他或许会哭得更大声一些。","Oliver cried lustily.If he could have known that he was an orphan, left to the tender mercies of church-wardens and overseers, perhaps he would have cried the louder."
"第二章 对奥利弗·特威斯特的成长、教育和食宿情况的介绍","CHAPTER II Treats of Oliver Twist’s growth, education, and board "
"在接下来的八个或十个月里，奥利弗成了一种有计划有步骤的背信与欺诈行为的牺牲品。他是用奶瓶喂大的。济贫院当局把这个孤儿饥饿穷困的情形正式报告给了教区当局。教区当局端着架子询问救济贫院当局，当下“院内”是否连一个可以给予奥利弗·特威斯特所急需的照料和营养的女人都没有。济贫院当局谦逊地回答说，没有。于是，教区当局做出一个宽宏大量、慈悲为怀的决定，奥利弗应该被“寄养”，或者换个说法，他要被打发到三英里外的一个济贫院分院去。那里有二三十个违犯了济贫法的少年犯成天满地打滚，他们没有吃得太饱或穿得太暖的麻烦，有一个老太太像父母那样管教他们。老太太接收这些小犯人，是考虑到每个小脑袋一周有七个半便士的补贴。一周七个半便士，对一个孩子来说，就是一周非常丰厚的伙食；七个半便士可以买很多东西了，完全足够把孩子的小肚皮撑得不舒服。老太太是个经验丰富的聪明人，她知道什么对孩子好，并且她非常清楚地知道什么对她自己有利。所以，她把每个星期孩子们的生活补贴的一大半都分给自己用，用在教区下一代身上的就甚至比本来规定的还要少。她凭此竟然在最深处发现还有更深处，证明了她自己是个非常伟大的实验哲学家。","For the next eight or ten months, Oliver was the victim of a systematic course of treachery and deception.He was brought up by hand.The hungry and destitute situation of the infant orphan was duly reported by the workhouse authorities to the parish authorities.The parish authorities inquired with dignity of the workhouse authorities, whether there was no female then domiciled in “the house” who was in a situation to impart to Oliver Twist, the consolation and nourishment of which he stood in need.The workhouse authorities replied with humility, that there was not.Upon this, the parish authorities magnanimously and humanely resolved, that Oliver should be “farmed,” or, in other words, that he should be dispatched to a branch-workhouse some three miles off,where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders against the poor-laws, rolled about the floor all day, without the inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing, under the parental superintendence of an elderly female, who received the culprits at and for the consideration of sevenpence-halfpenny per small head per week.Sevenpence-halfpenny’s worth per week is a good round diet for a child; a great deal may be got for sevenpence-halfpenny, quite enough to overload its stomach, and make it uncomfortable.The elderly female was a woman of wisdom and experience; she knew what was good for children; and she had a very accurate perception of what was good for herself.So, she appropriated the greater part of the weekly stipend to her own use, and consigned the rising parochial generation to even a shorter allowance than was originally provided for them.Thereby finding in the lowest depth a deeper still; and proving herself a very great experimental philosopher."
"大家都知道另一个实验哲学家的故事，他有一套马不吃草也能活的伟大理论，并且十分出色地亲身验证了这一理论，他把自己的马的饲料减到一天一根稻草。毫无疑问，要不是这匹马在即将获得第一份美味的空气饲料的二十四小时前就死了的话，他早就养出一匹什么东西也不用吃的英勇烈马了。不幸的是，受委托保护照料奥利弗·特威斯特的这位女士的实验哲学，她那套制度实施起来也总产生相似的结果。每当孩子试图靠着最小份、最劣质的食物生存下来的时候，十个里有八个半还是会发生这种事，不是因为饥饿和寒冷病倒，就是因为疏忽掉进了火炉，或是因为意外而差点窒息，只要是其中任意一种情形，可怜的小东西通常就会被召唤到另一个世界去，在那里和他们此生从未见过的先祖相聚。","Everybody knows the story of another experimental philosop her who had a great theory about a horse being able to live without eating, and who demonstrated it so well, that he had got his own horse down to a straw a day, and would unquestionably have rendered him a very spirited and rampacious animal on nothing at all, if he had not died, four-and-twenty hours before he was to have had his first comfortable bait of air.Unfortunately for, the experimental philosophy of the female to whose protecting care Oliver Twist was delivered over, a similar result usually attended the operation of her system; for at the very moment when the child had contrived to exist upon the smallest possible portion of the weakest possible food, it did perversely happen in eight and a half cases out of ten,either that it sickened from want and cold, or fell into the fire from neglect, or got half-smothered by accident; in any one of which cases, the miserable little being was usually summoned into another world, and there gathered to the fathers it had never known in this."
"偶尔会有关于教区孩子的非常有趣的审讯，翻床架的时候没注意到那里面还有个孩子，或是恰好在有清洗的时候不小心烫死一个孩子——尽管后面这种事故很罕见，在寄养所清洗这类事情是非常稀少的——陪审团会心血来潮地问一些麻烦的问题，不然就是教区居民公开反抗，签名抗议。但是这些鲁莽的行为会被外科医生的证据和教区执事的证词迅速击退，前者总是剖开尸体，发现里面什么也没有（这其实是非常有可能的），而后者总是教区让他们发什么誓，他们就发什么誓，誓言非常具有献身精神。另外，管理委员会定期拜访寄养所，并且总是在前一天派来教区执事，说他们要来了。当他们去的时候，孩子们看起来清洁干净，人们还想要怎么样呢！","Occasionally, when there was some more than usually interesting inquest upon a parish child who had been overlooked in turning up a bedstead, or inadvertently scalded to death when there happened to be a washing—though the latter accident was very scarce,anything approaching to a washing being of rare occurrence in the farm—the jury would take it into their heads to ask troublesome questions, or the parishioners would rebelliously affix their signatures to a remonstrance.But these impertinences were speedily checked by the evidence of the surgeon, and the testimony of the beadle; the former of whom had always opened the body and found nothing inside (which was very probable indeed), and the latter of whom invariably swore whatever the parish wanted; which was very self-devotional.Besides, the board made periodical pilgrimages to the farm, and always sent the beadle the day before, to say they were going.The children were neat and clean to behold, when they went; and what more would the people have!"
"不能指望这种寄养体制能产出什么特别的或是丰硕的成果。奥利弗·特威斯特九岁生日的时候，是个苍白瘦弱的孩子，身量有些小，腰也实在太细。但是造化或遗传已经在奥利弗的心中植入了顽强的精神。多亏了寄养所里贫乏的伙食，这种精神才能有广阔的发展空间；或许正是因为在这种环境中成长，他好歹还活到了第九个生日。然而，不论是不是这样，今天是他的九岁生日，他正在放煤的地窖里和另外两个精心挑选出的同伴一起庆祝生日。那两位年轻的绅士和他一样十恶不赦，居然放肆地喊饿，他们三个在挨了一顿结结实实的好打之后，被关了起来。这时，寄养所的好妈妈曼太太，被教区执事邦布尔先生出人意料的出现吓了一跳，他正在努力打开花园大门上的小门。","It cannot be expected that this system of farming would produce any very extraordinary or luxuriant crop.Oliver Twist’s ninth birthday found him a pale thin child, somewhat diminutive in stature, and decidedly small in circumference.But nature or inheritance had implanted a good sturdy spirit in Oliver ’s breast.It had had plenty of room to expand, thanks to the spare diet of the establishment; and perhaps to this circumstance may be attributed his having any ninth birth-day at all.Be this as it may, however, it was his ninth birthday; and he was keeping it in the coal-cellar with a select party of two other young gentleman, who, after participating with him in a sound thrashing, had been locked up for atrociously presuming to be hungry,when Mrs. Mann, the good lady of the house, was unexpectedly startled by the apparition of Mr. Bumble, the beadle, striving to undo the wicket of the garden-gate."
"“神啊！是你吗，邦布尔先生？”曼太太说，她把头伸出窗外，恰如其分地装出了一副欣喜若狂的表情，“（苏珊，把奥利弗和那两个兔崽子带上楼去，赶快把他们洗干净。）——我的天哪！邦布尔先生，见到你我真是太高兴啦，真的！”","“Goodness gracious!Is that you, Mr. Bumble, sir?” said Mrs. Mann, thrusting her head out of the window in well-affected ecstasies of joy.“(Susan, take Oliver and them two brats upstairs, and wash ’em directly.)—My heart alive!Mr. Bumble, how glad I am to see you, sure-ly!”"
"这不，邦布尔先生是个脾气暴躁的胖子，所以，他没有用相同的态度回应这热情的问候，而是猛地晃了一下小门，然后又踹了它一脚，除了教区执事，谁也踢不出这样一脚。","Now, Mr. Bumble was a fat man, and a choleric; so, instead of responding to this open-hearted salutation in a kindred spirit, he gave the little wicket a tremendous shake, and then bestowed upon it a kick which could have emanated from no leg but a beadle’s."
"“主啊，想想看，”曼太太说着，跑了出来——这段时间里三个孩子已经被带走了——“想想看！我竟然忘了这门是从里面闩上的，这都是因为那些可爱的孩子们！进来吧，先生，快请进，邦布尔先生，来吧，先生。”","“Lor, only think,” said Mrs. Mann, running out,—for the three boys had been removed by this time,—“only think of that!That I should have forgotten that the gate was bolted on the inside, on account of them dear children!Walk in sir; walk in, pray, Mr. Bumble, do, sir.”"
"尽管这邀请伴着一个可能会让教区委员都心软的屈膝礼，却压根不能平息这位教区执事的不快。","Although this invitation was accompanied with a curtsey that might have softened the heart of a church-warden, it by no means mollified the beadle."
"“曼太太，你觉得这种行为礼貌吗？正当吗？”邦布尔先生握紧手杖，问道，“教区官员为了教区孤儿的公务到这里来，你却让他们在你的花园门口一直等？你知不知道，曼太太，你是——要是我能这么说——教区委派的代表，而且是领着薪水的？”","“Do you think this respectful or proper conduct, Mrs. Mann,” inquired Mr. Bumble, grasping his cane, “to keep the parish officers a-waiting at your garden-gate, when they come here upon porochial business with the porochial orphans?Are you aware, Mrs. Mann, that you are, as I may say, a porochial delegate, and a stipendiary?”"
"“我能肯定，邦布尔先生，我只是在告诉一两个特别喜欢你的可爱孩子，说你来了。”曼太太无比谦卑地回答。","“I’m sure Mr. Bumble, that I was only a telling one or two of the dear children as is so fond of you, that it was you a-coming,” replied Mrs. Mann with great humility."
"邦布尔先生非常看好自己的口才和身价。他已经展示了口才，又证明了自己的身价。他放松了下来。","Mr. Bumble had a great idea of his oratorical powers and his importance.He had displayed the one, and vindicated the other.He relaxed."
"“好了，好了，曼太太，”他用较为缓和的语气回答说，“可能真像你说的那样，这有可能。带我进去吧，曼太太，因为我公务在身，有话要说。”","“Well, well, Mrs. Mann,” he replied in a calmer tone; “it may be as you say; it may be.Lead the way in, Mrs. Mann, for I come on business, and have something to say.”"
"曼太太领着教区执事进了一间地面铺砖的小会客室，安排他坐下，又过分殷勤地把他的三角帽和手杖放在他面前的桌上。邦布尔先生擦掉额头上因为赶路而流的汗，沾沾自喜地扫了一眼三角帽，微笑起来。是的，他微笑了。教区执事也是人：邦布尔先生笑了。","Mrs. Mann ushered the beadle into a small parlour with a brick floor; placed a seat for him; and officiously deposited his cocked hat and cane on the table before him.Mr. Bumble wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his walk had engendered, glanced complacently at the cocked hat, and smiled.Yes, he smiled.Beadles are but men: and Mr. Bumble smiled."
"“那么你不会因为我要说的话生气吧？”曼太太用迷人的甜蜜语气说，“你走了这么远的路，你知道，否则我不会这么提议的。那么，你要不要先喝一小口，邦布尔先生？”","“Now don’t you be offended at what I’m a going to say,” observed Mrs. Mann, with captivating sweetness.“You’ve  had a long walk, you know, or I wouldn’t mention it.Now, will you take a little drop of somethink, Mr. Bumble?”"
"“一口也不。一口也不。”邦布尔先生说着，以一种威严却又平易近人的风度摆着右手。","“Not a drop.Nor a drop,” said Mr. Bumble, waving his right hand in a dignified, but placid manner."
"“我想你会的。”曼太太注意到他拒绝的语气以及与之相伴的手势，说道，“只是一小口，加一点凉水，再放一块糖。”","“I think you will,” said Mrs. Mann, who had noticed the tone of the refusal, and the gesture that had accompanied it.“Just a leetle drop, with a little cold water, and a lump of sugar.”"
"邦布尔先生咳嗽了一下。","Mr. Bumble coughed."
"“这样，就喝一小口吧。”曼太太劝道。","“Now, just a leetle drop,” said Mrs. Mann persuasively."
"“是什么酒？”教区执事问。","“What is it?” inquired the beadle."
"“哎呀，我总得在屋里备上一点这东西呀，这些上帝保佑的孩子们不舒服的时候，就掺进他们的达菲糖浆里，邦布尔先生。”曼太太说着，打开一个墙角里的小橱柜，拿下来一瓶酒和一只玻璃杯。“是杜松子酒。我不骗你，邦先生。是杜松子酒。”","“Why, it’s what I’m obliged to keep a little of in the house, to put into the blessed infants’ Daffy when they ain’t well, Mr. Bumble,” replied Mrs. Mann as she opened a corner cupboard, and took down a bottle and glass.“It’s gin.I’ll not deceive you, Mr. B. it’s gin.”"
"“你给孩子们喝达菲糖浆吗，曼太太？”邦布尔问，眼睛紧盯着有趣的调酒过程。","“Do you give the children Daffy, Mrs. Mann?” inquired Bumble, following with his eyes the interesting process of mixing."
"“啊，上帝保佑他们，我是那样做的，尽管很贵。”保育员回答道，“我不能看着他们在我眼前受罪，你知道的，先生。”","“Ah, bless ’em, that I do, dear as it is,” replied the nurse.“I couldn’t see ’em suffer before my very eyes, you know sir.”"
"“是啊，”邦布尔先生赞许地说，“是的，你不能那样。你是个好心的女人，曼太太。”","“No”; said Mr. Bumble approvingly; “no, you could not.You are a humane woman, Mrs. Mann.”"
"（这时她放下了杯子。）“我会尽快找个机会向委员会提到这一点，曼太太。”","(Here she set down the glass.) “I shall take a early opportunity of mentioning it to the board, Mrs. Mann.”"
"（他把杯子移向自己。）“你给人的感觉就像母亲一样，曼太太。”（他搅动着掺了水的杜松子酒。）“我——我非常高兴为你的健康喝下这一杯，曼太太。”他一口吞下半杯酒。","(He drew it towards him.) “You feel as a mother, Mrs. Mann.”(He stirred the gin and water.) “I—I drink your health with cheerfulness, Mrs. Mann”; and he swallowed half of it."
"“现在谈谈正事吧，”教区执事说着，取出一个皮制小本，“那个只受了一半洗礼的孩子奥利弗·特威斯特，今天九岁了。”","“And now about business,” said the beadle, taking out a leathern pocket-book.“The child that was half-baptized Oliver Twist, is nine year old to-day.”"
"“上帝保佑他！”曼太太插嘴说，一边用围裙角擦着左眼。","“Bless him!” interposed Mrs. Mann, inflaming her left eye with the corner of her apron."
"“尽管有十镑的悬赏，后来还增加到二十镑，尽管教区方面尽了最大努力，我该说，是超常的最大努力，”邦布尔说，“我们始终没能找到他的父亲是谁，或者他母亲的住址、姓名或是社会地位。”","“And notwithstanding a offered reward of ten pound, which was afterwards increased to twenty pound.Notwithstanding the most superlative, and, I may say, supernat’ral exertions on the part of this parish,” said Bumble, “we have never been able to discover who is his father, or what was his mother’s settlement, name, or condition.”"
"曼太太惊讶地举起双手，在沉思了一阵后补充道：“那他的名字到底是怎么来的？”","Mrs. Mann raised her hands in astonishment; but added, after a moment’s reflection, “How comes he to have any name at all, then?”"
"教区执事非常神气地挺直身体，说：“是我起的。”","The beadle drew himself up with great pride, and said, “I inwented it.”"
"“是你，邦布尔先生！”","“You, Mr. Bumble!”"
"“是我，曼太太。我们按着字母表的顺序给我们宠爱着的孩子们取名。上一个是S——斯瓦布尔，我给他取的。这个孩子是T——特威斯特，我这么叫他。下一个来的就要叫昂温，再下一个叫维尔金斯。我已经把名字取到字母表的末尾了，当我们取到Z的时候，就全部从头再来一遍。”","“I, Mrs. Mann.We name our fondlings in alphabetical order.The last was a S,—Swubble, I named him.This was a T,—Twist, I named him.The next one comes will be Unwin, and the next Vilkins.I have got names ready made to the end of the alphabet, and all the way through it again, when we come to Z.”"
"“哎呀，你可真是位文学家，先生！”曼太太说。","“Why, you’re quite a literary character, sir!” said Mrs. Mann."
"“哪里，哪里，”教区执事显然对这种恭维很满意，“或许我算是吧。或许我算是，曼太太。”他喝完了掺水的杜松子酒，又说：“奥利弗现在太大了，不适合呆在这里了，委员会已经决定让他回济贫院。我亲自出来带他过去。所以立刻叫他来见我。”","“Well, well,” said the beadle, evidently gratified with the compliment; “perhaps I may be.Perhaps I may be, Mrs. Mann.”He finished the gin and water, and added, “Oliver being now too old to remain here, the board have determined to have him back into the house.I have come out myself to take him there.So let me see him at once.”"
"“我马上把他带来。”曼太太说着，离开了房间去叫奥利弗。这时，奥利弗脸上手上的一层泥壳已经擦掉了，一次清洗也就能擦掉这么多，他被他仁慈的女保护人领进了房间。","“I’ll fetch him directly,” said Mrs. Mann, leaving the room for that purpose.Oliver, having had by this time as much of the outer coat of dirt which encrusted his face and hands, removed, as could be scrubbed off in one washing, was led into the room by his benevolent protectress."
"“向这位绅士鞠躬，奥利弗。”曼太太说。","“Make a bow to the gentleman, Oliver,” said Mrs. Mann."
"奥利弗鞠了个躬，一半对着椅子上坐着的教区执事，一半对着桌子上放着的三角帽。","Oliver made a bow, which was divided between the beadle on the chair, and the cocked hat on the table."
"“你愿意跟我一起走吗，奥利弗？”邦布尔先生用庄严的声音说。","“Will you go along with me, Oliver?” said Mr. Bumble, in a majestic voice."
"奥利弗本想说他早就准备好跟任何人走了，这时他往上一看，看见曼太太站在教区执事的椅子后面，正一脸愤怒地向自己挥着拳头。他立刻理解了这个暗示，因为这拳头在他身上打下过太多印记，不可能不在他的记忆里留下深刻印象。","Oliver was about to say that he would go along with anybody with great readiness, when, glancing upward, he caught sight of Mrs. Mann, who had got behind the beadle’s chair, and was shaking her fist at him with a furious countenance.He took the hint at once, for the fist had been too often impressed upon his body not to be deeply impressed upon his recollection."
"“她会和我一起走吗？”可怜的奥利弗问道。","“Will she go with me?” inquired poor Oliver."
"“不，她不能，”邦布尔先生回答说，“但是她会不时地来看看你。”","“No, she can’t,” replied Mr. Bumble.“But she’ll come and see you sometimes.”"
"这对孩子来说可不算是一大安慰。虽然他还小，但是他已经能够装出特别不愿离开的样子。对这个男孩来说，流点眼泪并不是太难的事。如果想哭，饥饿和最近遭受的虐待是最好的帮手，事实上奥利弗哭得非常自然。曼太太拥抱了他无数次，还给了他一块黄油面包，这是奥利弗更想要的，这样他到济贫院的时候便不会显得太饿。奥利弗手上拿着面包片，头上戴着教区的褐色小布帽，当下被邦布尔先生领着离开了这个悲惨的家，在这里，从来没有过一句温言善语或是一道亲切的目光，曾照亮他幼年的阴暗时光。尽管如此，当村舍大门在他身后合上的时候，他还是生出一阵孩子气的苦恼忧伤。他抛在身后的那些生活在苦难中的小伙伴们，尽管他们很淘气，却是他结识的仅有的朋友，这个孩子的心里第一次生出一种身处大千世界的孤独感。","This was no very great consolation to the child.Young as he was, however, he had sense enough to make a feint of feeling great regret at going away.It was no very difficult matter for the boy to call tears into his eyes.Hunger and recent ill-usage are great assistants if you want to cry; and Oliver cried very naturally indeed.Mrs. Mann gave him a thousand embraces, and what Oliver wanted a great deal more, a piece of bread and butter, less he should seem too hungry when he got to the workhouse.With the slice of bread in his hand, and the little brown-cloth parish cap on his head, Oliver was then led away by Mr. Bumble from the wretched home where one kind word or look had never lighted the gloom of his infant years.And yet he burst into an agony of childish grief, as the cottage-gate closed after him.Wretched as were the little companions in misery he was leaving behind, they were the only friends he had ever known; and a sense of his loneliness in the great wide world, sank into the child’s heart for the first time."
"邦布尔先生继续大步前进，小奥利弗紧紧抓住他绣了金色蕾丝的袖口，在他旁边一路小跑，每走完四分之一里路就问，他们是否“就要到了”。","Mr. Bumble walked on with long strides; little Oliver, firmly grasping his gold-laced cuff, trotted beside him, inquiring at the end of every quarter of a mile whether they were “nearly there.”"
"对这些问题，邦布尔先生没好气地给出了十分简短的回答，掺水的杜松子酒在他内心唤醒的一时温柔此时早已蒸发了，他又成为了一位教区执事。","To these interrogations Mr. Bumble returned very brief and snappish replies; for the temporary blandness which gin and water awakens in some bosoms had by this time evaporated; and he was once again a beadle."
"奥利弗进入济贫院还不到一刻钟，几乎还没啃完第二片面包，把他交给一个老太太照看的邦布尔先生就回来了，并且告诉他今晚委员会开会，委员们要奥利弗立刻去见他们。","Oliver had not been within the walls of the workhouse a quarter of an hour, and had scarcely completed the demolition of a second slice of bread, when Mr. Bumble, who had handed him over to the care of an old woman, returned; and, telling him it was a board night, informed him that the board had said he was to appear before it forthwith."
"奥利弗还没太搞清楚“活着的木板”是个什么概念（注：英文原文中board既有“委员会”之意，又有“木板”之意），对这个消息相当震惊，并且不是很确定他是该笑还是该哭。然而，他没有时间去考虑这事了，因为邦布尔先生用手杖在他脑门上敲了一下，让他回过神来，又在他背上来了一下，让他精神饱满：然后命令他跟上，把他领进了一个刷成白色的大房间，里面有八到十个胖胖的绅士围桌而坐。在桌子上首，有一把比其他椅子都高的扶手椅，上面坐着一位特别胖的绅士，脸又大又圆，面色十分红润。","Not having a very clearly defined notion of what a live board was, Oliver was rather astounded by this intelligence, and was not quite certain whether he ought to laugh or cry.He had no time to think about the matter, however; for Mr. Bumble gave him a tap on the head, with his cane, to wake him up: and another on the back to make him lively: and bidding him to follow, conducted him into a large white-washed room, where eight or ten fat gentlemen were sitting round a table.At the top of the table, seated in an arm-chair rather higher than the rest, was a particularly fat gentleman with a very round, red face."
"“向委员们鞠躬。”邦布尔说。奥利弗擦掉两三滴在眼中逗留的泪水，看见没有木板只有桌子，幸运地朝它鞠了一躬。","“Bow to the board,” said Bumble.Oliver brushed away two or three tears that were lingering in his eyes; and seeing no board but the table, fortunately bowed to that."
"“孩子，你叫什么名字？”坐在高椅子上的绅士问道。","“What’s your name, boy?” said the gentleman in the high chair."
"奥利弗一看有这么多位绅士，吓得要命，浑身发抖；教区执事在他身后又敲了一下，把他弄哭了。这两个原因使他用一种很低很犹豫的声音回答了问题，于是一位穿白背心的绅士断定他是个傻子；对别人评头论足是这位绅士提神、放松的重要手段。","Oliver was frightened at the sight of so many gentlemen, which made him tremble: and the beadle gave him another tap behind, which made him cry.These two causes made him answer in a very low and hesitating voice; whereupon a gentleman in a white waistcoat said he was a fool, which was a capital way of raising his spirits, and putting him quite at his ease."
"“孩子，”高椅子上的绅士说道，“听我说。我想，你知道自己是个孤儿吧？”","“Boy,” said the gentleman in the high chair, “listen to me.You know you’re an orphan, I suppose?”"
"“那是什么，先生？”可怜的奥利弗问。","“What’s that, sir?” inquired poor Oliver."
"“这个男孩是个傻瓜——我原先就这么想。”穿白背心的绅士说。","“The boy is a fool—I thought he was,” said the gentleman in the white waistcoat."
"“安静！”最先说话的绅士开口说，“你知道你无父无母，是被教区养大的，是吧？”","“Hush!” said the gentleman who had spoken first. “You know you’ve  got no father or mother, and that you were brought up by the parish, don’t you?”"
"“是的，先生。”奥利弗一边回答，一边痛苦地落泪。","“Yes, sir,” replied Oliver, weeping bitterly."
"“你为什么哭？”穿白背心的绅士问道。这确实很不平常。这孩子有什么好哭的？","“What are you crying for?” inquired the gentleman in the white waistcoat.And to be sure it was very extraordinary.What could the boy be crying for?"
"“我希望你每天晚上都能祷告，”另一个嗓音粗哑的绅士说，“为养育你、照料你的人祈祷——要像个基督徒。”","“I hope you say your prayers every night,” said another gentleman in a gruff voice; “and pray for the people who feed you, and take care of you—like a Christian.”"
"“是的，先生。”男孩结结巴巴地说。最后说话的这位绅士无意中说对了。如果奥利弗为养育和照料他的人祈祷过的话，他早就会很像是一个基督徒了，并且是个优秀杰出的基督徒。但是他没有，因为没有人教过他。","“Yes, sir,” stammered the boy.The gentleman who spoke last was unconsciously right.It would have been very like a Christian, and a marvellously good Christian too, if Oliver had prayed for the people who fed and took care of him.But he hadn’t, because nobody had taught him."
"“好吧！你到这里是来受教育的，是来学一门有用的手艺的。”高椅子上的红脸绅士说。","“Well!You have come here to be educated, and taught a useful trade,” said the red-faced gentleman in the high chair."
"“所以你从明早六点开始拣麻絮。”穿白背心的绅士板着脸补充道。","“So you’ll begin to pick oakum to-morrow morning at six o’clock,” added the surly one in the white waistcoat."
"为了感谢他们把这两大幸事通过拣麻絮这么一个简单的步骤合二为一，奥利弗在教区执事的指导下深深鞠了一躬，然后匆匆离开，来到一间大收容室，他躺在那里面的一张凸凹不平的硬床上呜咽着睡着了。这是对英国宽厚仁慈的律法多么精彩的写照啊！他们允许贫民们睡觉！","For the combination of both these blessings in the one simple process of picking oakum, Oliver bowed low by the direction of the beadle, and was then hurried away to a large ward; where, on a rough, hard bed, he sobbed himself to sleep.What a novel illustration of the tender laws of England!They let the paupers go to sleep!"
"可怜的奥利弗！他哪里想得到，在他对周遭的一切毫无所知地幸福睡下时，委员会就在这天做了一个决定，这个决定会对他未来的命运产生最实质的影响。他们决定了。这个决定是这样的：委员会的成员都是非常贤明而有深度的哲人，而当他们将注意力转到济贫院上的时候，他们立刻发现了一个普通人发现不了的事情——穷人们喜欢救济院！对于比较贫困的阶级，它是个合格的公共娱乐场所，一个不用付钱的旅馆，一个常年为公众提供三餐和茶点的地方，一个砖和泥建成的极乐世界，这里只用享乐，不用工作。“哎哟！”看上去非常了解情况的委员们说，“我们是纠正这种情况的同道之人，我们将立刻彻底结束它。”所以，他们制定了规则，即所有穷人都该有选择余地（因为他们不会强迫任何人，不会的），要么在济贫院里按部就班地饿死，要么出去马上饿死。怀着这个目的，他们和水厂签订了无限制供水的合同，又和一个粮商协定，让其按期提供少量的麦片；每日分发三顿薄粥，一周发放两次洋葱，礼拜日发半个面包卷。他们还制定了很多其他的英明仁慈的规章，它们涉及到妇女，没有必要在此复述。他们好心地着手拆散贫穷的夫妇，因为伦敦民事律师公会处理一项诉讼的费用太贵了。他们不再强迫男人像以前那样养家，而是把他的家人带走，让他变成单身汉！如果不是和济贫院联系在一起，单看最后这两条，很难说社会各阶层会有多少人来申请救济。但是委员们都很睿智，早已为应付这一难题做好了准备。救济与济贫院和稀粥密不可分，这把人吓坏了。","Poor Oliver!He little thought, as he lay sleeping in happy unconsciousness of all around him, that the board had that very day arrived at a decision which would exercise the most material influence over all his future fortunes.But they had.And this was it: The members of this board were very sage, deep, philosophical men; and when they came to turn their attention to the workhouse, they found out at once, what ordinary folks would never have discovered—the poor people liked it!It was a regular place of public entertainment for the poorer classes; a tavern where there was nothing to pay; a public breakfast, dinner, tea, and supper all the year round; a brick and mortar elysium, where it was all play and no work.“Oho!” said the board, looking very knowing; “we are the fellows to set this to rights; we’ll stop it all, in no time.”So, they established the rule, that all poor people should have the alternative (for they would compel nobody, not they), of being starved by a gradual process in the house, or by a quick one out of it.With this view, they contracted with the water-works to lay on an unlimited supply of water; and with a corn-factor to supply periodically small quantities of oatmeal; and issued three meals of thin gruel a day, with an onion twice a week, and half a roll of Sundays.They made a great many other wise and humane regulations, having reference to the ladies, which it is not necessary to repeat; kindly undertook to divorce poor married people, in consequence of the great expense of a suit in Doctors’ Commons; and, instead of compelling a man to support his family, as they had theretofore done, took his family away from him, and made him a bachelor!There is no saying how many applicants for relief, under these last two heads, might have started up in all classes of society, if it had not been coupled with the workhouse; but the board were long-headed men, and had provided for this difficulty.The relief was inseparable from the workhouse and the gruel; and that frightened people."
"在奥利弗·特威斯特被带回来的头六个月里，这种体制完全实施了起来。最初花费很大，因为殡葬承办人开的账单有所增加，而且必须把所有穷人的衣服都改小，在喝了一两周稀粥后，他们的衣服都变得松松垮垮，在他们日渐消瘦的身上飘动。但是济贫院居民的人数和贫民一样变少了，委员会欣喜若狂。","For the first six months after Oliver Twist was removed, the system was in full operation.It was rather expensive at first, in consequence of the increase in the undertaker’s bill, and the necessity of taking in the clothes of all the paupers, which fluttered loosely on their wasted, shrunken forms, after a week or two’s gruel.But the number of workhouse inmates got thin as well as the paupers; and the board were in ecstasies."
"孩子们吃饭的房间是一个宽敞的石头大厅，在一侧放了一口铜锅；到了开饭的时候，师傅就特地穿上围裙，在一两个女人的帮助下，从锅里舀出稀粥。在这种节日似的规格下，一个孩子一碗粥，没有多的——除非在重大公众节庆的时候，他才能在此之外再得到二又四分之一盎司面包。","The room in which the boys were fed, was a large stone hall, with a copper at one end: out of which the master, dressed in an apron for the purpose, and assisted by one or two women, ladled the gruel at mealtimes.Of this festive composition each boy had one porringer, and no more—except on occasions of great public rejoicing, when he had two ounces and a quarter of bread besides."
"碗从来用不着洗。孩子们用汤勺把碗刮得干干净净，直到它们重新锃光瓦亮。他们在进行这项操作的时候（这绝对用不了多久，勺子和碗差不多一样大），会坐在那儿，无比热切地盯着铜锅，好像能把垫锅的砖头也吞下去似的；同时，他们狠命地吮着手指，为了不落下任何可能溅在手指上的粥水。男孩们通常胃口都很好。奥利弗·特威斯特和他的伙伴们忍受了三个月慢性饥饿的折磨，最后他们因为饥饿变得十分贪婪疯狂。有一个男孩，在他那个年纪个子算高的，还没习惯这种生活（因为他的父亲开过一家小饭馆），脸色阴郁地暗示他的同伴们，除非他每天多分到一盆粥，否则他恐怕可能会在某个晚上吃掉睡在他旁边的男孩，那个男孩刚好是个年幼体弱的小孩子。他的眼神狂热饥渴，他们绝对相信他。孩子们开了一个会，抽签决定谁应该在当天晚饭后走到大师傅面前，去要更多吃的，奥利弗·特威斯特抽中了。","The bowls never wanted washing.The boys polished them with their spoons till they shone again; and when they had performed this operation (which never took very long, the spoons being nearly as large as the bowls), they would sit staring at the copper, with such eager eyes, as if they could have devoured the very bricks of which it was composed;employing themselves, meanwhile, in sucking their fingers most assiduously, with the view of catching up any stray splashes of gruel that might have been cast thereon.Boys have generally excellent appetites.Oliver Twist and his companions suffered the tortures of slow starvation for three months: at last they got so voracious and wild with hunger,that one boy, who was tall for his age, and hadn’t been used to that sort of thing (for his father had kept a small cook-shop), hinted darkly to his companions, that unless he had another basin of gruel per diem, he was afraid he might some night happen to eat the boy who slept next him, who happened to be a weakly youth of tender age.He had a wild, hungry eye; and they implicitly believed him.A council was held; lots were cast who should walk up to the master after supper that evening, and ask for more; and it fell to Oliver Twist."
"夜晚降临了，孩子们坐到自己的位子上。大师傅穿着做饭的行头，站到铜锅旁边，他的贫民助手们立在他身后，粥已经分发出去了，念完了长长的感恩祷告之后是短暂的用餐时间。粥吃完了，孩子们互相低声耳语，朝奥利弗眨眨眼，这时他邻座的人用胳膊肘轻轻推了他一下。尽管他只是个孩子，却因饥饿而不顾一切，因苦难而不计后果。他从桌边站起身来，向大师傅走去，手里抓着食盆和汤勺，开口时被自己的鲁莽吓了一跳：“劳驾，先生，我想再要一点。”","The evening arrived; the boys took their places.The master, in his cook’s uniform, stationed himself at the copper; his pauper assistants ranged themselves behind him; the gruel was served out; and a long grace was said over the short commons.The gruel disappeared; the boys whispered each other, and winked at Oliver ; while his next neighbors nudged him.Child as he was, he was desperate with hunger, and reckless with misery.He rose from the table; and advancing to the master, basin and spoon in hand, said: somewhat alarmed at his own temerity: “Please, sir, I want some more.”"
"大师傅是个身体健康的胖男人，但他听到这句话后，脸色变得非常苍白。他惊愕地盯着这个小小的反抗者看了几秒钟，然后紧紧抓住铜锅支撑着自己。帮厨的女人们惊呆了，一动不动，而孩子们也害怕得呆住了。","The master was a fat, healthy man; but he turned very pale.He gazed in stupefied astonishment on the small rebel for some seconds, and then clung for support to the copper.The assistants were paralysed with wonder; the boys with fear."
"“什么！”大师傅终于有气无力地说。","“What!” said the master at length, in a faint voice."
"“劳驾，先生，”奥利弗回答，“我想再要一点。”","“Please, sir,” replied Oliver, “I want some more.”"
"大师傅操起勺子，对准奥利弗的脑袋打了一下，用双臂把他夹住，大声尖叫着要找教区执事。","The master aimed a blow at Oliver’s head with the ladle; pinioned him in his arm; and shrieked aloud for the beadle."
"当邦布尔先生万分激动地冲进房间时，委员会正开着庄严的秘密会议，他对高椅子上的绅士说：“利姆金斯先生，请您原谅，先生！奥利弗·特威斯特想要更多的粥！”","The board were sitting in solemn conclave, when Mr. Bumble rushed into the room in great excitement, and addressing the gentleman in the high chair, said, “Mr. Limbkins, I beg your pardon, sir!Oliver Twist has asked for more!”"
"大家都被震惊了。每个人脸上都现出恐惧的神情。","There was a general start.Horror was depicted on every countenance."
"“要更多的粥！”利姆金斯先生说。“保持镇静，邦布尔，清楚地回答我。那么你是说，他在已经吃了按规定配给的晚饭之后还想要？”","“For more!” said Mr. Limbkins.“Compose yourself, Bumble, and answer me distinctly.Do I understand that he asked for more, after he had eaten the supper allotted by the dietary?”"
"“是的，先生。”邦布尔先生回答。","“He did, sir,” replied Bumble."
"“那孩子会被绞死。”穿白背心的绅士说，“我知道他会被绞死的。”","“That boy will be hung,” said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.“I know that boy will be hung.”"
"没有人反驳这位绅士的预言。一场热烈的讨论就此展开。奥利弗立刻被关了禁闭；第二天早上，大门外贴上了一张告示，说任何人只要愿意从教区手里接受奥利弗·特威斯特，就能得到五镑的奖赏。换句话说，任何人，不论男女，只要想找一个学徒，无论去干什么买卖、生意、行当，都可以把五镑钱和奥利弗·特威斯特领走。","Nobody controverted the prophetic gentleman’s opinion.An animated discussion took place.Oliver was ordered into instant confinement; and a bill was next morning pasted on the outside of the gate, offering a reward of five pounds to anybody who would take Oliver Twist off the hands of the parish.In other words, five pounds and Oliver Twist were offered to any man or woman who wanted an apprentice to any trade, business, or calling."
"“我这辈子从来没有像这样确信过一件事，”第二天一早，穿白背心的绅士一边敲着大门，读着告示，一边说，“我这辈子从来没有像这样确信过一件事，那就是这个孩子将来会被绞死。”","“I never was more convinced of anything in my life,” said the gentleman in the white waistcoat, as he knocked at the gate and read the bill next morning: “I never was more convinced of anything in my life, than I am that that boy will come to be hung.”"
"我打算以后再透露穿白背心的绅士是对是错，如果我现在冒险提示奥利弗·特威斯特的人生是否会像这样惨烈收场，我可能会破坏了这个故事的趣味（假设它多少有一些趣味）。","As I purpose to show in the sequel whether the white waistcoated gentleman was right or not, I should perhaps mar the interest of this narrative (supposing it to possess any at all), if I ventured to hint just yet, whether the life of Oliver Twist had this violent termination or no."
"第三章 对奥利弗·特威斯特如何差点得到一个不是闲差的职位的叙述","CHAPTER III Relates how Oliver Twist was very near getting a place which would not have been a sinecure"
"奥利弗竟然妄图多要一点粥，犯下了大不敬且亵渎神明的罪行，这之后一个星期，他一直被单独关在一间黑暗的房间里当犯人，这是英明仁慈的委员会的安排。一眼看上去，有理由假设，如果他对穿白背心的绅士的预言抱有适宜的尊重之情，他就会把手帕的一端系在墙上的钩子上，把自己系在另一端，一劳永逸地帮助那位圣贤树立起在预言方面的名望。但是，要实现这一壮举，有一个障碍：即手帕被定为了奢侈之物，在所有未来的时光和岁月里，都得从贫民们的鼻子下面移开了。这是委员会发布的命令，是在集会上经由他们亲手签字盖章，被郑重发表公布的。还有一个更大的障碍，即奥利弗年幼无知。他只是整天痛哭，当漫长凄凉的黑夜降临的时候，他用自己的小手盖住眼睛来隔绝黑暗，蜷缩在角落里试图入睡：他不时战栗着惊醒，就愈发往墙角里缩，仿佛感觉到，甚至那冰冷坚硬的墙面也是让他远离周遭的黑暗和孤独的保护层。","For a week after the commission of the impious and profane offence of asking for more, Oliver remained a close prisoner in the dark and solitary room to which he had been consigned by the wisdom and mercy of the board.It appears, at first sight not unreasonable to suppose, that, if he had entertained a becoming feeling of respect for the prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat, he would have established that sage individual’s prophetic character, once and for ever, by tying one end of his pocket-handkerchief to a hook in the wall, and attaching himself to the other.To the performance of this feat, however, there was one obstacle: namely, that pocket-handkerchiefs being decided articles of luxury, had been, for all future times and ages, removed from the noses of paupers by the express order of the board, in council assembled: solemnly given and pronounced under their hands and seals.There was a still greater obstacle in Oliver’s youth and childishness.He only cried bitterly all day; and, when the long, dismal night came on, spread his little hands before his eyes to shut out the darkness, and crouching in the corner, tried to sleep:ever and anon waking with a start and tremble, and drawing himself closer and closer to the wall, as if to feel even its cold hard surface were a protection in the gloom and loneliness which surrounded him."
"敌视该体制的人们不要以为，在他这段孤独的禁闭期里，奥利弗获取不了运动的益处、社交的乐趣或是宗教慰藉的好处。在运动方面，天气很冷，他被允许在邦布尔先生面前，每天早上在石头院子的水泵下沐浴，邦布尔先生为了防止他感冒，反复用手杖打他，在他全身留下火辣辣的感觉。社交方面，他每隔一天被带到孩子们用餐的大厅，在众目睽睽之下被鞭打，以儆效尤。至于说他得不到宗教慰藉的好处，每晚祷告的时间一到，他就会被踢进同一间屋子，被允许在那里聆听其他孩子们一齐祈祷，借此慰藉自己的心灵。委员会当局在祷告中特别插入了一条，恳求大家变得高尚、善良、知足、恭顺，保护大家远离奥利弗·特威斯特的罪孽和恶行：祷告明确地阐明，他受到邪恶势力的独家庇护，是直接来自恶魔本人的工厂的产物。","Let it not be supposed by the enemies of “the system,” that, during the period of his solitary incarceration, Oliver  was denied the benefit of exercise, the pleasure of society, or the advantages of religious consolation.As for exercise, it was nice cold weather, and he was allowed to perform his ablutions every morning under the pump, in a stone yard, in the presence of Mr. Bumble, who prevented his catching cold, and caused a tingling sensation to pervade his frame, by repeated applications of the cane.As for society, he was carried every other day into the hall where the boys dined, and there sociably flogged as a public warning and example.And so for from being denied the advantages of religious consolation, he was kicked into the same apartment every evening at prayer-time, and there permitted to listen to, and console his mind with, a general supplication of the boys, containing a special clause, therein inserted by authority of the board, in which they entreated to be made good, virtuous, contented, and obedient, and to be guarded from the sins and vices of Oliver Twist: whom the supplication distinctly set forth to be under the exclusive patronage and protection of the powers of wickedness, and an article direct from the manufactory of the very Devil himself."
"碰巧一天早上，当奥利弗正处在这种幸运舒适的状态下时，扫烟囱的甘菲尔德先生来到了这条大街上。他正在仔细深入地思考如何才能还上欠下的房租，房东为此已经催得很紧了。即使甘菲尔德先生对自己的财务状况做最乐观的估计，他也无法凑出所需要的整整五英镑。他算数算得绝望了，用棍子一会儿敲一敲自己的脑门，一会儿抽一下驴子，当他路过济贫院时，他的目光落在了大门上的告示上。","It chanced one morning, while Oliver’s affairs were in this auspicious and comfortable state, that Mr. Gamfield, chimney-sweep, went his way down the High Street, deeply cogitating in his mind his ways and means of paying certain arrears of rent, for which his landlord had become rather pressing.Mr. Gamfield’s most sanguine estimate of his finances could not raise them within full five pounds of the desired amount; and, in a species of arithmetical desperation, he was alternately cudgelling his brains and his donkey, when passing the workhouse, his eyes encountered the bill on the gate."
"“唔——喔！”甘菲尔德先生对驴子说。","“Wo—o!” said Mr. Gamfield to the donkey."
"驴子正处在一种深度走神的状态：可能正在自忖，在处理了小车装着的这两袋煤烟后，它是否能够尽情享受一两片白菜帮子。所以，它没听见命令，继续慢吞吞地往前走着。","The donkey was in a state of profound abstraction: wondering, probably, whether he was destined to be regaled with a cabbage-stalk or two when he had disposed of the two sacks of soot with which the little cart was laden; so, without noticing the word of command, he jogged onward."
"甘菲尔德先生咆哮着对驴子一顿狠骂，尤其是针对它的眼睛。他还跑上前去，对着它的脑袋打了一下，如果这不是一头驴，脑壳肯定会被打破。然后，他抓住辔头，把驴下颌使劲一拧，温和地提醒它，它并非自己的主人，他用了这些方法才让它转过头去。接着他在它脑袋上又来了一下，只是让它在自己回来之前一直这么呆着。做好了这些安排，他走向大门去读告示。","Mr. Gamfield growled a fierce imprecation on the donkey generally, but more particularly on his eyes; and, running after him, bestowed a blow on his head, which would inevitably have beaten in any skull but a donkey’s.Then, catching hold of the bridle, he gave his jaw a sharp wrench, by way of gentle reminder that he was not his own master; and by these means turned him round.He then gave him another blow on the head, just to stun him till he came back again.Having completed these arrangements, he walked up to the gate, to read the bill."
"在会议室陈述了自己的深刻见解后，穿白背心的绅士正背着手站在大门边。他目睹了甘菲尔德先生和驴子之间的这点小争执，于是当那人走上前来读告示的时候，他快活地微笑起来，因为他马上看出甘菲尔德先生正是奥利弗·特威斯特需要的那种主人。甘菲尔德先生仔细看了文件，也微笑起来，因为五镑正是他想要的那个数目。至于它拖带着的那个孩子，甘菲尔德先生知道济贫院的伙食状况，完全明白他会是件不错的小东西，正是扫烟囱的合适之选。所以，他把告示又从头到尾慢慢地读了一遍，然后，他碰了碰自己的皮帽以示谦恭，和穿白背心的绅士攀谈起来。","The gentleman with the white waistcoat was standing at the gate with his hands behind him, after having delivered himself of some profound sentiments in the board-room.Having witnessed the little dispute between Mr. Gamfield and the donkey, he smiled joyously when that person came up to read the bill, for he saw at once that Mr. Gamfield was exactly the sort of master Oliver Twist wanted.Mr. Gamfield smiled, too, as he perused the document; for five pounds was just the sum he had been wishing for; and, as to the boy with which it was encumbered, Mr. Gamfield, knowing what the dietary of the workhouse was, well knew he would be a nice small pattern, just the very thing for register stoves.So, he spelt the bill through again, from beginning to end; and then, touching his fur cap in token of humility, accosted the gentleman in the white waistcoat."
"“先生，这儿是不是有个男孩儿，教区想让他当个‘学徒’？”甘菲尔德先生说。","“This here boy, sir, wot the parish wants to ‘prentis’,” said Mr. Gamfield."
"“是啊，我的朋友。”穿白背心的绅士带着谦逊的微笑说，“你看他怎么样？”","“Ay, my man,” said the gentleman in the white waistcoat, with a condescending smile.“What of him?”"
"“如果教区想让他学一门正当合意的手艺，在那相当受人尊敬的烟囱清扫业，”甘菲尔德先生说，“我正想要个学徒，我准备要他。”","“If the parish vould like him to learn a right pleasant trade, in a good ‘spectable chimbley-sweepin’ bisness,” said Mr. Gamfield, “I wants a ’prentis, and I am ready to take him.”"
"“进来吧。”穿白背心的绅士说。甘菲尔德先生在后面耽搁了一下，又照着驴头来了一掌，把驴下颌拧了一下，警告驴子在他离开的时候不要乱跑。然后他跟着穿白背心的绅士进了屋，奥利弗在那里第一次见到了他。","“Walk in,” said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.Mr. Gamfield having lingered behind, to give the donkey another blow on the head, and another wrench of the jaw, as a caution not to run away in his absence, followed the gentleman with the white waistcoat into the room where Oliver  had first seen him."
"“这可是个脏活计。”利姆金斯先生听到甘菲尔德再次陈述了他的愿望，便说道。","“It’s s a nasty trade,” said Mr. Limbkins, when Gamfield had again stated his wish."
"“在此之前，有小孩子在烟囱里窒息了。”另一位绅士说。","“Young boys have been smothered in chimneys before now,” said another gentleman."
"“那是因为要叫他们再下来，他们在烟囱里还没点燃稻草，就把它们弄湿了，”甘菲尔德先生说，“那样就全是烟，没有火，烟根本没法叫小孩子下来，只会让他睡觉，而这正是他喜欢的。孩子们都很顽固，很懒，先生们，没什么比一团烧热的火更有效了，他们准跑着下来。这也是很人道的，先生们，因为即使他们被困在烟囱里，烤一烤他们的脚就能让他们自己挣扎着解决问题。”","“That’s acause they damped the straw afore they lit it in the chimbley to make ’em come down again,” said Gamfield; “that’s all smoke, and no blaze; vereas smoke ain’t o' no use at all in making a boy come down, for it only sinds him to sleep, and that’s wot he likes.Boys is wery obstinit, and wery lazy, Gen’l’men, and there’s nothink like a good hot blaze to make ’em come down vith a run.It’s humane too, gen’l’men, acause, even if they’ve stuck in the chimbley, roasting their feet makes ’em struggle to hextricate theirselves.”"
"穿白背心的绅士看起来被这种解释逗乐了，但他的欢笑马上被利姆金斯先生的一个眼神制止了。委员会开始了内部会谈，谈了几分钟，但是声音很低，只能听见几个词，“节省开支”，“账面上看着不错”，“发布一份铅印的报告”。这些词碰巧能被听到，也是因为它们给重复了好几次，还被着重强调。","The gentleman in the white waistcoat appeared very much amused by this explanation; but his mirth was speedily checked by a look from Mr. Limbkins.The board then proceeded to converse among themselves for a few minutes, but in so low a tone, that the words “saving of expenditure,” “looked well in the accounts,” “have a printed report published,” were alone audible.These only chanced to be heard, indeed, or account of their being very frequently repeated with great emphasis."
"最终，密谈结束，委员会成员们回到座位，恢复了一本正经的样子，利姆金斯先生说：“我们考虑了你的提议，我们并不同意。”","At length the whispering ceased; and the members of the board, having resumed their seats and their solemnity, Mr. Limbkins said: “We have considered your proposition, and we don’t approve of it.”"
"“一点儿也不。”穿白背心的绅士说。","“Not at all,” said the gentleman in the white waistcoat."
"“坚决不行。”其他的委员们补充道。","“Decidedly not,” added the other members."
"由于甘菲尔德先生碰巧背负了让三到四个孩子受伤至死的轻微罪名，他觉得，也许委员会在某些不可理解的反常状态下，把这件无关的事纳入到了他们的议程中。这和他们一贯的做事风格差了十万八千里，尽管这样，由于甘菲尔德先生不是特别希望那些流言被重提，他用手扭着帽子，从桌边慢慢地走开。","As Mr. Gamfield did happen to labour under the slight imputation of having bruised three or four boys to death already, it occurred to him that the board had, perhaps, in some unaccountable freak, taken it into their heads that this extraneous circumstance ought to influence their proceedings.It was very unlike their general mode of doing business, if they had; but still, as he had no particular wish to revive the rumour, he twisted his cap in his hands, and walked slowly from the table."
"“所以你们不会让我把他带走，先生们？”甘菲尔德先生说着，在靠近门的地方停了下来。","“So you won’t let me have him, gen’l’men ?” said Mr. Gamfield, pausing near the door."
"“是的，”利姆金斯先生回答，“至少，由于它是个脏活，我们认为你拿的钱应当少于我们提供的金额。”","“No,” replied Mr. Limbkins; “at least, as it’s a nasty business, we think you ought to take something less than the premium we offered.”"
"甘菲尔德先生的面容明朗起来，他快步回到桌边，说道：“你们给多少，先生们？说吧！别太为难一个穷苦人。你们想给多少？”","Mr. Gamfield’s countenance brightened, as, with a quick step, he returned to the table, and said, “What’s ll you give, gen’l’men ?Come!Don’t be too hard on a poor man.What’s ll you give?”"
"“我要说，三镑十先令足够了。”利姆金斯先生说。","“I should say, three pound ten was plenty,” said Mr. Limbkins."
"“十先令太多了。”穿白背心的绅士说。","“Ten shillings too much,” said the gentleman in the white waistcoat."
"“嗨！”甘菲尔德说,“给四镑吧，先生们。给四镑，你们就永远摆脱他了。好啦！”","“Come!” said Gamfield; “say four pound, gen’l’men.Say four pound, and you’ve  got rid of him for good and all.There!”"
"“三镑十先令。”利姆金斯先生坚决地重复。","“Three pound ten,” repeated Mr. Limbkins, firmly."
"“嗨！我让一步，先生们。”甘菲尔德催促道，“三镑十五先令。”","“Come!I’ll split the difference, gen’l’men,” urged Gamfield.“Three pound fifteen.”"
"“一个子儿也不多给。”这是利姆金斯先生坚定的回答。","“Not a farthing more,” was the firm reply of Mr. Limbkins."
"“你们对我真是太狠啦，先生们。”甘菲尔德先生说着，他动摇了。","“You’re desperate hard upon me, gen’l’men,” said Gamfield, wavering."
"“呸！呸！胡说！”穿白背心的绅士说，“就算压根没有奖赏，收下他也算捡便宜了，就当是个额外收获。把他带走，你这个蠢蛋！这孩子正适合你。他时不时地需要棍子，对他很有好处；他的食宿费不用太贵，因为他从出生起就没吃饱过。哈！哈！哈！”","“Pooh! pooh! nonsense!” said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.“He’d be cheap with nothing at all, as a premium.Take him, you silly fellow!He’s just the boy for you.He wants the stick, now and then: it’s ll do him good; and his board needn’t come very expensive, for he hasn’t been overfed since he was born.Ha! ha! ha!”"
"甘菲尔德先生狡黠地看了一眼桌旁的面庞，发现它们都带着微笑，他自己也渐渐微笑起来。交易成功了。邦布尔先生立即接到指示，奥利弗·特威斯特及其契约将在当天下午送至地方法官处，办理签字批准手续。","Mr. Gamfield gave an arch look at the faces round the table, and, observing a smile on all of them, gradually broke into a smile himself.The bargain was made.Mr. Bumble, was at once instructed that Oliver Twist and his indentures were to be conveyed before the magistrate, for signature and approval, that very afternoon."
"依照这项决定，小奥利弗的禁闭被解除了，并且他还奉命穿上了一件干净的衬衣，这些让他十分吃惊。他刚刚完成了这项非同一般的体育表演，邦布尔先生就亲手给他端来了一盆稀粥，以及二又四分之一盎司的节日分量的面包。看到这可怕的场面，奥利弗非常凄惨地大哭起来：他理所当然地以为，委员会肯定是因为某些有用的目的要杀了他，不然他们绝不会开始这样喂肥他。","In pursuance of this determination, little Oliver, to his excessive astonishment, was released from bondage, and ordered to put himself into a clean shirt.He had hardly achieved this very unusual gymnastic performance, when Mr. Bumble brought him, with his own hands, a basin of gruel, and the holiday allowance of two ounces and a quarter of bread.At this tremendous sight, Oliver began to cry very piteously: thinking, not unnaturally, that the board must have determined to kill him for some useful purpose, or they never would have begun to fatten him up in that way."
"“别把眼睛弄红了，奥利弗，好好吃你的东西，要感恩。”邦布尔先生用一种令人印象深刻的夸耀语气说道，“你就要去当学徒了，奥利弗。”","“Don’t make your eyes red, Oliver, but eat your food and be thankful,” said Mr. Bumble, in a tone of impressive pomposity.“You’re a going to be made a ’prentice of, Oliver.”"
"“学徒，先生！”孩子战栗着说。","“A prentice, sir!” said the child, trembling."
"“是的，奥利弗。”邦布尔先生说，“奥利弗，你无父无母，那位好心并且受到祝福的绅士就是你的再生父母。你将被送去当学徒，开始自己的人生，长大成人，尽管教区为此花了三镑十先令！——三镑十先令，奥利弗！——七十先令——一百四十个六便士硬币！——全为了一个没人喜欢的淘气孤儿！","“Yes, Oliver,” said Mr. Bumble.“The kind and blessed gentleman which is so many parents to you, Oliver, when you have none of your own, are a-going to ’prentice you, and to set you up in life, and make a man of you, although the expense to the parish is three pound ten!—three pound ten, Oliver!—seventy shillins—one hundred and forty sixpences!—and all for a naughty orphan which nobody can’t love.”"
"邦布尔先生用令人敬畏的语气讲完这番话后，停下来喘了口气。可怜的孩子脸上滚下了泪珠，他伤心地抽泣起来。","As Mr. Bumble paused to take breath, after delivering this address in an awful voice, the tears rolled down the poor child’s face, and he sobbed bitterly."
"“过来，”邦布尔先生注意到他的口才产生了这样的效果，感到十分满意，不那么傲慢了，“过来，奥利弗！用衣服袖口擦擦眼泪，别把眼泪掉到粥里去了，那可是非常蠢的行为，奥利弗。”那当然是，因为粥里的水已经够多了。","“Come,” said Mr. Bumble, somewhat less pompously, for it was gratifying to his feelings to observe the effect his eloquence had produced; “Come, Oliver!Wipe your eyes with the cuffs of your jacket, and don’t cry into your gruel; that’s a very foolish action, Oliver.”It certainly was, for there was quite enough water in it already."
"在去找地方法官的路上，邦布尔先生教导奥利弗，他要做的就是看上去很高兴，并且在那位绅士问他是否想当学徒的时候，说自己真的非常想当。奥利弗承诺遵守这两条命令，邦布尔先生还丢给他一个温和的暗示，那就是如果他有任何一条没做到，会怎么处置他可就很难说了。当他们到达办公室的时候，他被独自关进一间小屋，邦布尔先生警告他，让他呆在那里，直到自己回来接他。","On their way to the magistrate, Mr. Bumble instructed Oliver that all he would have to do, would be to look very happy, and say, when the gentleman asked him if he wanted to be apprenticed, that he should like it very much indeed;both of which injunctions Oliver promised to obey: the rather as Mr. Bumble threw in a gentle hint, that if he failed in either particular, there was no telling what would be done to him.When they arrived at the office, he was shut up in a little room by himself, and admonished by Mr. Bumble to stay there, until he came back to fetch him."
"男孩怀着一颗怦怦直跳的心，在那里呆了半个钟头。度过了这段时间之后，邦布尔先生探出头来，没带三角帽，大声说：“现在，奥利弗，亲爱的，到这位绅士这儿来。”邦布尔先生说完这话，就换上了一副可怕的威胁的表情，又低声补充说：“记住我告诉你的话，你这个小流氓！”","There the boy remained, with a palpitating heart, for half an hour.At the expiration of which time Mr. Bumble thrust in his head, unadorned with the cocked hat, and said aloud:“Now, Oliver, my dear, come to the gentleman.”As Mr. Bumble said this, he put on a grim and threatening look, and added, in a low voice, “Mind what I told you, you young rascal!”"
"听到这两种多少有些自相矛盾的腔调，奥利弗天真地盯着邦布尔先生的脸看，但是这位绅士没给他就此发表任何言论的机会，立刻把他领进隔壁的一个房间，房门是开着的。房间很大，有一扇大窗户。书桌后面坐着两个头上扑了粉的老绅士，一个正在看报纸，另一个戴着一副玳瑁眼镜，正在细读摆在他面前的一小张羊皮纸。利姆金斯先生站在书桌的一侧，甘菲尔德先生站在另一侧，脸都没洗干净，而两三个长相吓人、穿着长筒靴的男人正在屋里来回踱步。","Oliver stared innocently in Mr. Bumble’s face at this somewhat contradictory style of address; but that gentleman prevented his offering any remark thereupon, by leading him at once into an adjoining room: the door of which was open.It was a large room, with a great window.Behind a desk, sat two old gentleman with powdered heads: one of whom was reading the newspaper; while the other was perusing, with the aid of a pair of tortoise-shell spectacles, a small piece of parchment which lay before him.Mr. Limbkins was standing in front of the desk on one side; and Mr. Gamfield, with a partially washed face, on the other; while two or three bluff-looking men, in top-boots, were lounging about."
"戴眼镜的老绅士对着那一小片羊皮纸，渐渐打起瞌睡来。邦布尔先生领着奥利弗来到书桌前站好，等了一小会儿。","The old gentleman with the spectacles gradually dozed off, over the little bit of parchment; and there was a short pause, after Oliver had been stationed by Mr. Bumble in front of the desk."
"“就是这个孩子，大人。”邦布尔先生说。","“This is the boy, your worship,” said Mr. Bumble."
"看报纸的老绅士抬了一下头，扯了扯另一个老绅士的袖子，于是，后一位老绅士醒了。","The old gentleman who was reading the newspaper raised his head for a moment, and pulled the other old gentleman by the sleeve; whereupon, the last-mentioned old gentleman woke up."
"“噢，是这个孩子？”老绅士问。","“Oh, is this the boy?” said the old gentleman."
"“就是他，先生。”邦布尔先生回答，“向法官大人鞠躬，亲爱的。”","“This is him, sir,” replied Mr. Bumble.“Bow to the magistrate, my dear.”"
"奥利弗打起精神，恭恭敬敬地鞠了一躬。他的目光定在地方法官扑了粉的头发上，想知道是不是所有委员生下来头上就都带着那种白色的东西，是不是因为这个他们才成了委员。","Oliver roused himself, and made his best obeisance.He had been wondering, with his eyes fixed on the magistrates’ powder, whether all boards were born with that white stuff on their heads, and were boards from thenceforth on that account."
"“好吧，”老绅士说，“我猜想，他喜欢扫烟囱？”","“Well,” said the old gentleman, “I suppose he’s fond of chimney-sweeping?”"
"“他可喜欢了，大人。”邦布尔回答着，偷偷掐了奥利弗一下，暗示他最好不要说不喜欢。","“He doats on it, your worship,” replied Bumble; giving Oliver a sly pinch, to intimate that he had better not say he didn’t."
"“那么，他想要当一个扫烟囱的，是吗？”老绅士询问。","“And he will be a sweep, will he?” inquired the old gentleman."
"“如果我们明天让他去干别的职业，他会马上跑掉的，大人。”邦布尔回答。","“If we was to bind him to any other trade to-morrow, he’d run away simultaneous, your worship,” replied Bumble."
"“那个人是他将来的师傅吧——你，先生——你会好好待他，养活他，做所有这类事情，你做得到吗？”老绅士说。","“And this man that’s to be his master—you, sir—you’ll treat him well, and feed him, and do all that sort of thing, will you?” said the old gentleman."
"“我说我做得到，就意味着我做得到。”甘菲尔德先生硬生生地回答。","“When I says I will, I means I will,” replied Mr. Gamfield doggedly."
"“你说话挺粗鲁，我的朋友，但是你看起来是个老实直爽的人。”老绅士说着，把眼镜转向奥利弗赏金的候选人，甘菲尔德先生凶恶的面容上明显贴着残酷的标签。但是地方法官一半因为视力不好，一半是想法幼稚，所以不能指望他明智地洞悉其他人都看得出来的事情。","“You’re a rough speaker, my friend, but you look an honest, open-hearted man,” said the old gentleman: turning his spectacles in the direction of the candidate for Oliver’s premium, whose villainous countenance was a regular stamped receipt for cruelty.But the magistrate was half blind and half childish, so he couldn’t reasonably be expected to discern what other people did."
"“我希望我是，先生。”甘菲尔德先生斜着眼睛说道，样子十分难看。","“I hope I am, sir,” said Mr. Gamfield, with an ugly leer."
"“我不怀疑你，我的朋友。”老绅士回答说，他把鼻梁上的眼镜扶好，四处寻找墨水瓶。","“I have no doubt you are, my friend,” replied the old gentleman: fixing his spectacles more firmly on his nose, and looking about him for the inkstand."
"这是决定奥利弗命运的关键时刻。如果墨水瓶在老绅士原先想的地方，他就会把笔伸进去蘸水，签署契约，那么奥利弗就会立即被甘菲尔德先生匆忙带走了。但是，由于它正好直接就在他鼻子下面，接下来，不用说，他把桌子找了个遍，也没有找到它。在寻找的过程中，他直直往前看的时候，目光撞上了奥利弗·特威斯特苍白惊恐的脸。尽管邦布尔使眼色警告他、掐他，奥利弗还是带着一脸交织着恐惧与害怕的表情，打量着他未来师傅那令人厌恶的面容。他的这种表情太过明显，不容错认，即使是眼神不好的地方法官也能看出来。","It was the critical moment of Oliver’s fate.If the inkstand had been where the old gentleman thought it was, he would have dipped his pen into it, and signed the indentures, and Oliver would have been straightway hurried off.But, as it chanced to be immediately under his nose, it followed, as a matter of course, that he looked all over his desk for it, without finding it; and happening in the course of his search to look straight before him, his gaze encountered the pale and terrified face of Oliver Twist:who, despite all the admonitory looks and pinches of Bumble, was regarding the repulsive countenance of his future master, with a mingled expression of horror and fear, too palpable to be mistaken, even by a half-blind magistrate."
"老绅士停了下来，把笔搁下，看看奥利弗，又看看利姆金斯先生，后者正努力尝试着吸鼻烟，显得愉快高兴、漫不经心。","The old gentleman stopped, laid down his pen, and looked from Oliver to Mr. Limbkins; who attempted to take snuff with a cheerful and unconcerned aspect."
"“我的孩子！”老绅士说，“你看起来苍白惊慌。怎么回事？”","“My boy!” said the old gentleman, “you look pale and alarmed.What is the matter?”"
"“站得离他远点儿，教区助理。”另一位地方法官说着，把报纸放到一边，带着好奇的表情倾身向前，“现在，孩子，告诉我们怎么回事，不要害怕。”","“Stand a little away from him, Beadle,” said the other magistrate, laying aside the paper, and leaning forward with an expression of interest. “Now, boy, tell us what’s the matter: don’t be afraid.”"
"奥利弗跪了下来，双手握在一起，恳求他们能命令他回到黑屋子去——饿死他——打他——要是他们高兴杀了他也行——但不要把他打发给那个可怕的人。","Oliver fell on his knees, and clasping his hands together, prayed that they would order him back to the dark room—that they would starve him—beat him—kill him if they pleased—rather than send him away with that dreadful man."
"“哎呀！”邦布尔先生说着，用令人印象深刻的最一本正经的态度，举起双手，眼睛往上抬了起来。“哎呀！在我见过的所有狡猾阴险、诡计多端的孤儿里，奥利弗，你是最不要脸的一个。”","“Well!” said Mr. Bumble, raising his hands and eyes with most impressive solemnity.“Well! of all the artful and designing orphans that ever I see, Oliver, you are one of the most bare-facedest.”"
"“住嘴，助理。”邦布尔先生刚说出这个“最”字形容词，第二位老绅士喝道。","“Hold your tongue, Beadle,” said the second old gentleman, when Mr. Bumble had given vent to this compound adjective."
"“对不起，大人。”邦布尔先生说着，怀疑自己听错了，“大人您是在对我说话吗？”","“I beg your worship’s pardon,” said Mr. Bumble, incredulous of having heard aright.“Did your worship speak to me?”"
"“是的。闭上你的嘴。”","“Yes.Hold your tongue.”"
"邦布尔先生惊呆了。命令一个教区执事住嘴！一场思想革命！","Mr. Bumble was stupefied with astonishment.A beadle ordered to hold his tongue!A moral revolution!"
"戴着玳瑁眼镜的老绅士看看他的同事，那一位意味深长地点了点头。","The old gentleman in the tortoise-shell spectacles looked at his companion, he nodded significantly."
"“我们拒绝批准这些契约。”老绅士说着，把那张羊皮纸扔到一边。","“We refuse to sanction these indentures,” said the old gentleman: tossing aside the piece of parchment as he spoke."
"“我希望，”利姆金斯先生结结巴巴地说，“我希望法官大人们不要因为一个孩子无凭无据的证词，就认为济贫院当局有管理不当之罪。”","“I hope,” stammered Mr. Limbkins: “I hope the magistrates will not form the opinion that the authorities have been guilty of any improper conduct, on the unsupported testimony of a child.”"
"“地方法官可不负责对这件事发表看法。”第二位老绅士严厉地说，“把这孩子带回济贫院，好好待他。他似乎很想这样。”","“The magistrates are not called upon to pronounce any opinion on the matter,” said the second old gentleman sharply.“Take the boy back to the workhouse, and treat him kindly.He seems to want it.”"
"同一天晚上，穿白背心的绅士果断明确地声称，奥利弗不仅要被吊死，还要被开膛破肚，五马分尸。邦布尔先生阴郁而神秘地摇摇头，说他希望他会有个好结果。在这一点上，甘菲尔德先生回答说，他希望孩子还是到他这儿来，尽管他在大多数事情上同意教区执事的意见，但表达的这个愿望似乎完全相反。","That same evening, the gentleman in the white waistcoat most positively and decidedly affirmed, not only that Oliver would be hung, but that he would be drawn and quartered into the bargain.Mr. Bumble shook his head with gloomy mystery, and said he wished he might come to good; whereunto Mr. Gamfield replied, that he wished he might come to him; which, although he agreed with the beadle in most matters, would seem to be a wish of a totally opposite description."
"第二天一早，公众又一次被告知，说教区再次出让奥利弗·特威斯特，任何愿意接管他的人会获得五英镑。","The next morning, the public were once informed that Oliver Twist was again To Let, and that five pounds would be paid to anybody who would take possession of him."
"第四章 奥利弗得到另一个职位，初次涉世","CHAPTER IV Oliver, being offered another place, makes his first entry into public life"
"在大户人家，凡是在产权所有、复归、指定继承或是预定继承上，正在成长的年轻人得不到有利地位的时候，通常习惯性的做法是送他们出海。委员会仿效这个明智有益的范例，聚在一起讨论对付奥利弗·特威斯特的权宜之计，即用一条小货船把他遣往某个对健康极为有害的港口。送他出海看上去是处置他的最好的办法了。有这种可能性，即船长在哪天晚餐后觉得好玩，把他鞭打至死，或者用一根铁棒把他的脑袋打开花。众所周知，这两种消遣都是那个阶层的绅士们非常喜爱的大众娱乐。从这个观点来看，委员会越考虑这件事，这一举措显现出的好处就越多。所以，他们得出结论，唯一有效的供养奥利弗的方法就是立刻把他送去海上。","In great families, when an advantageous place cannot be obtained, either in possession, reversion, remainder, or expectancy, for the young man who is growing up, it is a very general custom to send him to sea.The board, in imitation of so wise and salutary an example, took counsel together on the expediency of shipping off Oliver Twist, in some small trading vessel bound to a good unhealthy port.This suggested itself as the very best thing that could possibly be done with him: the probability being, that the skipper would flog him to death, in a playful mood, some day after dinner, or would knock his brains out with an iron bar; both pastimes being, as is pretty generally known, very favourite and common recreations among gentleman of that class.The more the case presented itself to the board, in this point of view, the more manifold the advantages of the step appeared; so, they came to the conclusion that the only way of providing for Oliver effectually, was to send him to sea without delay."
"邦布尔先生被派去进行各种初步查问，想找找看有没有哪位船长或其他什么人想要个没亲没故的男服务生。他回到济贫院汇报任务完成的情况，在大门口正好遇到教区的殡葬承办人苏尔伯雷先生。","Mr. Bumble had been despatched to make various preliminary inquiries, with the view of finding out some captain or other who wanted a cabin-boy without any friends; and was returning to the workhouse to communicate the result of his mission; when he encountered at the gate, no less a person than Mr. Sowerberry, the parochial undertaker."
"苏尔伯雷先生个子高，骨架很大，显得很憔悴，穿着一套破烂的黑色礼服和打了补丁的同色袜子，鞋子也是黑色的。他的容貌本不宜带着微笑的神情，但他总的来说还是带点职业性的诙谐。他步履轻盈，脸上显现出发自内心的愉悦。他走上前来，诚挚地与邦布尔先生握手。","Mr. Sowerberry was a tall, gaunt, large-jointed man, attired in a suit of threadbare black, with darned cotton stockings of the same colour, and shoes to answer.His features were not naturally intended to wear a smiling aspect, but he was in general rather given to professional jocosity.His step was elastic, and his face betokened inward pleasantry, as he advanced to Mr. Bumble, and shook him cordially by the hand."
"“我已经为昨晚死去的那两个女人量好了尺寸，邦布尔先生。”殡葬承办人说道。","“I have taken the measure of the two women that died last night, Mr. Bumble,” said the undertaker."
"“你会发大财的，苏尔伯雷先生。”教区执事说着，把拇指和食指插进殡葬承办人递上的鼻烟壶里，这鼻烟壶是个精致小巧的棺材模型。“我说你会发大财的，苏尔伯雷先生。”邦布尔先生重复道，用手杖亲昵地拍了拍殡葬承办人的肩膀。","“You’ll make your fortune, Mr. Sowerberry,” said the beadle, as he thrust his thumb and forefinger into the proffered snuff-box of the undertaker: which was an ingenious little model of a patent coffin.“I say you’ll make your fortune, Mr. Sowerberry,” repeated Mr. Bumble, tapping the undertaker on the shoulder, in a friendly manner, with his cane."
"“你这么想？”殡葬承办人说，对于发财这事半信半疑，“委员会承诺的价钱太少了，邦布尔先生。”","“Think so?” said the undertaker in a tone which half admitted and half disputed the probability of the event.“The prices allowed by the board are very small, Mr. Bumble.”"
"“棺材也是。”教区执事回答，带着一副恰到好处、正好不失教区官员身份的笑容。","“So are the coffins,” replied the beadle: with precisely as near an approach to a laugh as a great official ought to indulge in."
"苏尔伯雷先生被这话彻底逗乐了——当然也应当这样，他持续笑了好长一段时间。“好啦，好啦，邦布尔先生，”他最后说，“不可否认，自从新的供给制度实施以来，棺材都比以前窄一点、浅一点了，但我们必须有赚头，邦布尔先生。完全干燥的木材是很贵的，先生，而所有的铁柄都是经运河从伯明翰运来的。”","Mr. Sowerberry was much tickled at this: as of course he ought to be; and laughed a long time without cessation.“Well, well, Mr. Bumble,” he said at length, “there’s no denying that, since the new system of feeding has come in, the coffins are something narrower and more shallow than they used to be; but we must have some profit, Mr. Bumble.Well-seasoned timber is an expensive article, sir; and all the iron handles come, by canal, from Birmingham.”"
"“好吧，好吧。”邦布尔先生说，“每个行当都有自己的难处。正当的利润当然是可以的。”","“Well, well,” said Mr. Bumble, “every trade has its drawbacks.A fair profit is, of course, allowable.”"
"“当然，当然，”殡葬承办人回答，“如果我在这个或那个商品上都没有利润的话，嘿，我就在长期经营中弥补回来，你明白的——嘻！嘻！嘻！”","“Of course, of course,” replied the undertaker; “and if I don’t get a profit upon this or that particular article, why, I make it up in the long-run, you see—he! he! he!”"
"“正是如此。”邦布尔先生说。","“Just so,” said Mr. Bumble."
"“可是我必须说，”殡葬承办人重新提起了被教区执事打断的评论话题，继续说，“可我必须说，邦布尔先生，我不得不与一种极为不利的情况做斗争，那就是，所有的胖人都是死得最快的。那些曾经生活富裕、交了很多年税的人一进入济贫院，是最先衰弱下来的。我跟你说，邦布尔先生，每个人比估算的大出三到四英寸，就会让某人的利润大大亏损，尤其是这人还要养家的时候，先生。”","“Though I must say,” continued the undertaker, resuming the current of observations which the beadle had interrupted: “though I must say, Mr. Bumble, that I have to contend against one very great disadvantage: which is, that all the stout people go off the quickest. The people who have been better off, and have paid rates for many years, are the first to sink when they come into the house; and let me tell you, Mr. Bumble, that three or four inches over one’s calculation makes a great hole in one’s profits: especially when one has a family to provide for, sir.”"
"苏尔伯雷先生说着这些，越来越愤慨，像个被虐待的人。邦布尔先生感到这样说下去势必有损教区的荣誉，觉得换个话题才是明智之举。他最先想到的就是奥利弗·特威斯特，于是把他拿来当话题。","As Mr. Sowerberry said this, with the becoming indignation of an ill-used man; and as Mr. Bumble felt that it rather tended to convey a reflection on the honour of the parish; the latter gentleman thought it advisable to change the subject.Oliver Twist being uppermost in his mind, he made him his theme."
"“顺便问一句，”邦布尔先生说，“你知道谁想找个男孩吗？他是教区的学徒，现在是个重担，一个沉重的包袱，可以说，正吊在教区的脖子上？条件优惠，苏尔伯雷先生，条件优惠啊。”邦布尔先生说着，抬起手杖指着上面的告示，对着用巨型罗马大写字母印在上面的“五镑”几个字，特意敲了三下。","“By the bye,” said Mr. Bumble, “you don’t know anybody who wants a boy, do you?A porochial ’prentis, who is at present a dead-weight; a millstone, as I may say, round the porochial throat?Liberal terms, Mr. Sowerberry, liberal terms?”As Mr. Bumble spoke, he raised his cane to the bill above him, and gave three distinct raps upon the words “five pounds”: which were printed thereon in Roman capitals of gigantic size."
"“天呐！”殡葬承办人说着，抓住邦布尔先生制服外套的金边翻领，“这正是我想和你谈的事情。你知道——哎呀，这颗扣子真精美，邦布尔先生！我以前从没注意到它。”","“Gadso!” said the undertaker: taking Mr. Bumble by the gilt-edged lappel of his official coat; “that’s just the very thing I wanted to speak to you about.You know—dear me, what a very elegant button this is, Mr. Bumble!I never noticed it before.”"
"“是的，我认为它相当漂亮。”教区执事说着，自豪地低头看了一眼这颗装饰在他外套上的大铜纽扣。“这纽扣的图案和教区印章上的是一样的——好心的撒马利亚人治愈病患和伤者。委员会在新年的早上赠送给我的，苏尔伯雷先生。我记得，第一次戴上它是去参加验尸，那个穷困潦倒的零售商午夜死在了别人家门口。”","“Yes, I think it rather pretty,” said the beadle, glancing proudly downwards at the large brass buttons which embellished his coat.“The die is the same as the porochial seal—the Good Samaritan healing the sick and bruised man.The board presented it to me on New-year’s morning, Mr. Sowerberry.I put it on, I remember, for the first time, to attend the inquest on that reduced tradesman, who died in a doorway at midnight.”"
"“我想起来了。”殡葬承办人说，“陪审团判决是‘死于受寒和缺乏日常生活必需品’，对不对？”","“I recollect,” said the undertaker.“The jury brought it in, ‘Died from exposure to the cold, and want of the common necessaries of life,’ didn’t they?”"
"邦布尔先生点了点头。","Mr. Bumble nodded."
"“我记得，他们把这事作为一项特别裁决，”殡葬承办人说，“加了几句话，意思是说如果负责贫民救济工作的官员当时——”“呸！愚蠢！”教区执事插嘴道，“那帮无知的陪审团整天胡说，如果委员会都听他们的，就有的忙了。”","“And they made it a special verdict, I think,” said the undertaker, “by adding some words to the effect, that if the relieving officer had—” “Tush!Foolery!” interposed the beadle.“If the board attended to all the nonsense that ignorant jurymen talk, they’d have enough to do.”"
"“说得好，”殡葬承办人说，“确实是这样。”","“Very true,” said the undertaker; “they would indeed.”"
"“陪审团，”班布尔先生说着，紧紧握着手杖，这是他发脾气时的习惯，“陪审团全是些粗俗卑下、没有教养的家伙。”","“Juries,” said Mr. Bumble, grasping his cane tightly, as was his wont when working into a passion: “juries is ineddicated, vulgar, grovelling wretches.”"
"“谁说不是呢。”殡葬承办人说。","“So they are,” said the undertaker."
"“他们就知道那么一点哲学和政治经济学。”教堂执事说着，轻蔑地弹了个响指。","“They haven’t no more philosophy nor political economy about ’em than that,” said the beadle, snapping his fingers contemptuously."
"“就那么一点。”殡葬承办人表示赞成。","“No more they have,” acquiesced the undertaker."
"“我鄙视他们。”教区执事说道，脸变得通红。","“I despise ’em,” said the beadle, growing very red in the face."
"“我也是。”殡葬承办人答道。","“So do I,” rejoined the undertaker."
"“我只希望找个那种见解独到的陪审团，让他们在济贫院里呆个一两周，”教区执事说，“委员会的规章制度很快就能把他们的气焰打压下去。”","“And I only wish we’d a jury of the independent sort, in the house for a week or two,” said the beadle; “the rules and regulations of the board would soon bring their spirit down for ’em.”"
"“任凭他们那样吧。”殡葬承办人回答。他这样说着，一边赞许地微笑起来，想平息这位愤慨的教区官员高涨的怒火。","“Let ’em alone for that,” replied the undertaker.So saying, he smiled, approvingly: to calm the rising wrath of the indignant parish officer."
"邦布尔先生抬起三角帽，从帽子顶里掏出一块手帕，擦去额头上因愤怒产生的汗水，然后重新戴好帽子，转向殡丧承办人，用平静了许多的语气说：“喂，这孩子怎么样？”","Mr Bumble lifted off his cocked hat; took a handkerchief from the inside of the crown; wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his rage had engendered; fixed the cocked hat on again; and, turning to the undertaker, said in a calmer voice: “Well; what about the boy?”"
"“噢！”殡葬承办人回答，“哎呀，邦布尔先生，我可为了穷人付了好大一笔税呢。”","“Oh!” replied the undertaker; “why, you know, Mr. Bumble, I pay a good deal towards the poor’s rates.”"
"“哼！”邦布尔先生说，“哦？”","“Hem!” said Mr. Bumble.“Well?”"
"“这个，”殡葬承办人回答，“我在想，既然我为他们花了这么多钱，就有权利从他们身上尽可能捞回来一些，邦布尔先生，所以——我自己想要这个孩子。”","“Well,” replied the undertaker, “I was thinking that if I pay so much towards ’em, I’ve  a right to get as much out of ’em as I can, Mr. Bumble; and so—I think I’ll take the boy myself.”"
"邦布尔先生抓住殡葬承办人的胳膊，把他领进楼里。苏尔伯雷先生和委员会密谈了五分钟，决定当晚就安排奥利弗去他那儿“实习”——这个词的意思，对一个教区学徒来说，就是在经过短期试用后，如果师傅发现孩子能干足够多的活，吃得又不太多，就会常年雇佣他，想让他干什么就让他干什么。那天晚上，小奥利弗被带到“绅士们”面前，被告知他当天晚上就要到棺材铺去当个普通的小伙计了。如果他抱怨自己的境遇，或是再回到济贫院，就会被送去海上，在那儿被淹死或是脑袋被打开花，这是有可能的。他没什么反应，于是他们一致宣布他是个铁石心肠的小坏蛋，并且命令邦布尔先生立刻把他带走。","Mr. Bumble grasped the undertaker by the arm, and led him into the building.Mr. Sowerberry was closeted with the board for five minutes; and it was arranged that Oliver should go to him that evening “upon liking”—a phrase which means, in the case of a parish apprentice, that if  the master find, upon a short trial, that he can get enough work out of a boy without putting too much food into him, he shall have him for a term of years, to do what he likes with. When little Oliver was taken before “the gentlemen” that evening; and informed that he was to go, that night, as general house-lad to a coffin-maker’s;and that if he complained of his situation, or ever came back to the parish again, he would be sent to sea, there to be drowned, or knocked on the head, as the case might be, he evinced so little emotion, that they by common consent pronounced him a hardened young rascal, and ordered Mr. Bumble to remove him forthwith."
"如果说，世上所有人中，任何人表现出哪怕一点点情感上的贫乏，委员会对此感到道德上的震惊和恐怖都是理所当然的，但在这个特例里，他们却错了。事实很简单，那就是奥利弗并非感情太少，而是感情太丰富了，很有可能会被所受的虐待弄得终生残酷无情，愚蠢迟钝，郁郁寡欢。他一声不吭地听着关于自己目的地的消息，手上接过自己的行李——拿起来不怎么费劲，因为全部也不过是一个棕色的牛皮纸包，大约半尺见方，三寸厚——他把帽子拉低盖住眼睛，又一次抓住邦布尔先生的衣袖，被这位要员领去了一处新的受难场所。","Now, although it was very natural that the board, of all people in the world, should feel in a great state of virtuous astonishment and horror at the smallest tokens of want of feeling on the part of anybody, they were rather out, in this particular instance.The simple fact was, that Oliver, instead of possessing too little feeling, possessed rather too much; and was in a fair way of being reduced, for life, to a state of brutal stupidity and sullenness by the ill usage he had received.He heard the news of his destination, in perfect silence; and, having had his luggage put into his hand—which was not very difficult to carry, inasmuch as it was all comprised within the limits of a brown paper parcel, about half a foot square by three inches deep—he pulled his cap over his eyes; and once more attaching himself to Mr. Bumble’s coat cuff, was led away by that dignitary to a new scene of suffering."
"有一段时间，邦布尔先生拉着奥利弗一直走，对他不理不睬，只管自己默不作声地迈步，头抬得直直的，一个教区执事就该一直这样。那天风很大，邦布尔先生的大衣下摆被风吹开，把奥利弗完全遮了起来。他同时露出了背心和暗色的毛绒马裤，在风中鼓动，帅气十足。然而，接近目的地时，邦布尔先生认为有必要低头看看，以保证孩子情况正常，可以接受新主人的检查。于是他这么做了，带着与一位仁慈的保护人非常相称的神气。","For some time, Mr. Bumble drew Oliver along, without notice or remark; for the beadle carried his head very erect, as a beadle always should: and, it being a windy day, little Oliver was completely enshrouded by the skirts of Mr. Bumble’s coat as they blew open, and disclosed to great advantage his flapped waistcoat and drab plush knee-breeches.As they drew near to their destination, however, Mr. Bumble thought it expedient to look down, and see that the boy was in good order for inspection by his new master: which he accordingly did, with a fit and becoming air of gracious patronage."
"“奥利弗！”邦布尔先生说。","“Oliver!” said Mr. Bumble."
"“是，先生。”奥利弗低声回答道，声音颤抖。","“Yes, sir,” replied Oliver, in a low, tremulous voice."
"“把帽子从眼睛上拿开，抬起头来，先生。”","“Pull that cap off your eyes, and hold up your head, sir.”"
"尽管奥利弗立刻按要求照办了，还用空闲的手背迅速地擦了擦眼睛，但当他看向自己的向导时，眼睛里还是噙着一滴眼泪。邦布尔先生严厉地瞪了他一眼，这滴眼泪就顺着脸颊滚了下来。紧跟着又流了一滴，再一滴。孩子努力想要忍住，但是于事无补。他从邦布尔先生那儿抽回另一只手，双手盖住脸，哭了起来，直到泪水从他的脸颊和瘦削的手指间喷涌而出。","Although Oliver did as he was desired, at once; and passed the back of his unoccupied hand briskly across his eyes, he left a tear in them when he looked up at his conductor.As Mr. Bumble gazed sternly upon him, it rolled down his cheek.It was followed by another, and another.The child made a strong effort, but it was an unsuccessful one.Withdrawing his other hand from Mr. Bumble’s he covered his face with both; and wept until the tears sprung out from between his chin and bony fingers."
"“好啦！”邦布尔先生叫道。他突然停下，向他照管的这个小家伙抛去一道非常狠毒的目光。“嗳！在我见过的所有最不领情、最差劲的孩子里，奥利弗，你是最——”“不，不，先生，”奥利弗呜咽着，抓住教区执事握在那根著名手杖上的手，“不，不，先生，我真的会变好的，真的，真的我会的，先生！我只是个小孩子，先生，又那么——那么——”“那么什么？”邦布尔先生好奇地问道。","“Well!” exclaimed Mr. Bumble, stopping short, and darting at his little charge a look of intense malignity.“Well!Of all the ungratefullest, and worst-disposed boys as ever I see, Oliver, you are the—” “No, no, sir,” sobbed Oliver, clinging to the hand which held the well-known cane; “no, no, sir; I will be good indeed; indeed, indeed I will, sir!I am a very little boy, sir; and it is so—so—” “So what?” inquired Mr. Bumble in amazement."
"“那么孤单，先生！我太孤单了！”孩子哭喊道。“所有人都讨厌我。噢！先生，不要，请您不要对我发火！”孩子用手拍着心口，看着同行者的脸，泪水里满是真切的痛苦。","“So lonely, sir!So very lonely!” cried the child.“Everybody hates me.Oh! sir, don’t, don’t pray be cross to me!”The child beat his hand upon his heart; and looked in his companion’s face, with tears of real agony."
"邦布尔先生有些惊讶地看着奥利弗可怜无助的神情，打量了几秒钟，用沙哑的声音哼哼了三四声，嘀咕了一些“这烦人的咳嗽”之类的话，然后吩咐奥利弗擦干眼泪，做个好孩子。然后他再一次拉起他的手，一起默默地向前走去。","Mr. Bumble regarded Oliver ’s piteous and helpless look, with some astonishment, for a few seconds; hemmed three or four times in a husky manner; and after muttering something about “that troublesome cough,” bade Oliver  dry his eyes and be a good boy.Then once more taking his hand, he walked on with him in silence."
"殡葬承办人刚关上了铺子门，正借着与本店业务非常相称的昏暗烛光记账，这时邦布尔先生进来了。","The undertaker, who had just put up the shutters of his shop, was making some entries in his day-book by the light of a most appropriate dismal candle, when Mr. Bumble entered."
"“啊哈！”殡葬承办人说着，从账簿上抬起头来，字写了一半也停了下来，“是你吗，邦布尔？”","“Aha!” said the undertaker; looking up from the book, and pausing in the middle of a word; “is that you, Bumble?”"
"“没别人，苏尔伯雷先生。”教区执事回答，“嘿！我把孩子带来了。”奥利弗鞠了个躬。","“No one else, Mr. Sowerberry,” replied the beadle.“Here!I’ve  brought the boy.”Oliver made a bow."
"“噢！是这个孩子，是吗？”殡葬承办人说着，把蜡烛举过头顶，好把奥利弗看得更清楚些。“苏尔伯雷夫人，能否劳驾过来一下，我亲爱的？”","“Oh! that's the boy, is it?” said the undertaker: raising the candle above his head, to get a better view of Oliver.“Mrs. Sowerberry, will you have the goodness to come here a moment, my dear?”"
"苏尔伯雷夫人从铺子后面的一个小房间里出来了，她身材矮小，瘦得像是被挤瘪了，一脸泼辣的神色。","Mrs. Sowerberry emerged from a little room behind the shop, and presented the form of a short, then, squeezed-up woman, with a vixenish countenance."
"“我亲爱的，”苏尔伯雷先生谦恭地说，“这就是我跟你说过的那个济贫院的孩子。”奥利弗再次鞠躬。","“My dear,” said Mr. Sowerberry, deferentially, “this is the boy from the workhouse that I told you of.”Oliver bowed again."
"“我的天！”殡葬承办人的太太说，“他可真小。”","“Dear me!” said the undertaker’s wife, “he’s very small.”"
"“唔，他的确相当小，”邦布尔先生看着奥利弗回答，就好像奥利弗长得不高大是他自己的过错似的，“他很小。这不可否认。但是他会长的，苏尔伯雷夫人——他会长的。”","“Why, he is rather small,” replied Mr. Bumble: looking at Oliver as if it were his fault that he was no bigger; “he is small.There’s no denying it.But he’ll grow, Mrs. Sowerberry—he’ll grow.”"
"“啊！我敢说他会的，”这位女士悻悻地说，“靠着在我们这儿混吃混喝。我看教区的孩子省不了钱，一点也省不了，因为养他们要花的钱比他们本身值的钱还多。但是，男人们总是觉得他们知道的最多。好啦！下楼去，小皮包骨。”说着这些，殡葬承办人的太太打开一扇侧门，推着奥利弗走下一段很陡的楼梯，来到一间潮湿阴暗的石室，这间被命名为“厨房”的前厅连着煤窖，里面坐着个脏兮兮的女孩，鞋后跟磨得露出了脚跟，蓝色的毛线袜已经破得没法再补了。","“Ah!I dare say he will,” replied the lady pettishly, “on our victuals and our drink.I see no saving in parish children, not I; for they always cost more to keep, than they’re worth.However, men always think they know best. There!Get downstairs, little bag o’bones.”With this, the undertaker’s wife opened a side door, and pushed Oliver down a steep flight of stairs into a stone cell, damp and dark: forming the ante-room to the coal-cellar, and denominated “kitchen”; wherein sat a slatternly girl, in shoes down at heel, and blue worsted stockings very much out of repair."
"“喂，夏洛特，”苏尔伯雷夫人跟着奥利弗下来了，“把留给特里普的冷饭给这孩子一点。他从早上就没回来过，所以大概不用吃饭了。我敢说这孩子不会对吃的太挑剔——是不是，孩子？”","“Here, Charlotte,” said Mr. Sowerberry, who had followed Oliver down, “give this boy some of the cold bits that were put by for Trip.He hasn’t come home since the morning, so he may go without ’em.I dare say the boy isn’t too dainty to eat ’em—are you, boy?”"
"奥利弗一听到有吃的，双眼立刻闪闪发亮，他浑身颤抖，带着大吃一顿的渴望作了否定的回答，一盘坏了的粗糙食物摆在了他的面前。","Oliver, whose eyes had glistened at the mention of meat, and who was trembling with eagerness to devour it, replied in the negative; and a plateful of coarse broken victuals was set before him."
"有个吃得好的哲学家，他吃的酒肉在体内变成了胆汁，血液变成了寒冰，心脏变成了钢铁，我希望某个这样的哲学家能来看看奥利弗是怎样紧抓连狗都不屑一顾的美食。我希望他能当场看一看饿得发狂的奥利弗怎样带着令人恐怖的贪婪把食物撕成碎片。只有一件事情是我更想看到的，那就是这位哲学家本人能用同样的胃口吃下和这一样的饭菜。","I wish some well-fed philosopher, whose meat and drink turn to gall within him; whose blood is ice, whose heart is iron; could have seen Oliver Twist clutching at the dainty viands that the dog had neglected.I wish he could have witnessed the horrible avidity with which Oliver tore the bits asunder with all the ferocity of famine.There is only one thing I should like better; and that would be to see the Philosopher making the same sort of meal himself, with the same relish."
"“唔，”殡葬承办人太太一声不吭地看着奥利弗吃完晚饭，心里很害怕，对他将来的胃口无比担忧，“你吃好了没？”","“Well,” said the undertaker’s wife, when Oliver  had finished his supper: which she had regarded in silent horror, and with fearful auguries of his future appetite: “have you done?”"
"奥利弗见四下里已经没有任何能吃的东西了，就给了个肯定的回答。","There being nothing eatable within his reach, Oliver replied in the affirmative."
"“那跟我来吧，”苏尔伯雷夫人说着，举起一盏昏暗肮脏的油灯，领路上楼，“你的床铺在柜台下面。我猜，你不介意睡在棺材之间吧？但是你介不介意都无所谓，因为没别的地方让你睡了。快来，别让我整晚呆在这儿！”","“Then come with me,” said Mrs. Sowerberry: taking up a dim and dirty lamp, and leading the way upstairs; “your bed’s under the counter.You don’t mind sleeping among the coffins, I suppose?But it doesn’t much matter whether you do or don’t, for you can’t sleep anywhere else.Come; don’t keep me here all night!”"
"奥利弗不再拖拖拉拉，而是温顺地跟上他的新女主人。","Oliver lingered no longer, but meekly followed his new mistress."
"第五章 奥利弗结交新伙伴。第一次参加葬礼，他就对主人的生意产生了不适宜的看法","CHAPTER V Oliver mingles with new associates. Going to a funeral for the first time, he forms an unfavorable notion of his master's business"
"奥利弗独自留在殡葬承办人的铺子里，把油灯放在一个工作台上，带着一种敬畏恐惧感怯生生地打量四周，很多年纪比他大得多的人也能完全明白这种感觉。一口还没做完的棺材立在铺子中央的黑色支架上，它看起来阴森森的，带着死亡的气息，每当他的眼睛往这个阴暗之物的方向看去，他就会全身打冷战，几乎觉得会看到某个可怕的身影从里面慢慢抬头，把自己吓得疯掉。靠着墙规则地摆放着一长排切成同样形状的榆木板，在昏暗的光线下，看起来就像一个个耸着肩膀、手插在马裤口袋里的鬼魂。棺材铭牌、榆木碎屑、亮头钉子和黑布碎片散落得满地都是。柜台后面的墙上装饰着一幅生动的图画，画里两个送丧人戴着僵硬的领结，守在私人住宅巨大的门旁，远处有一辆四匹黑马拉着的灵车正在接近。铺子里又闷又热。空气似乎染上了棺材的味道。柜台下面的凹处塞着他的毛屑床垫，看起来像个坟墓。","Oliver, being left to himself in the undertaker’s shop, set the lamp down on a workman’s bench, and gazed timidly about him with a feeling of awe and dread, which many people a good deal older than he will be at no loss to understand.An unfinished coffin on black tressels, which stood in the middle of the shop, looked so gloomy and death-like that a cold tremble came over him, every time his eyes wandered in the direction of the dismal object: from which he almost expected to see some frightful form slowly rear its head, to drive him mad with terror.Against the wall were ranged, in regular array, a long row of elm boards cut in the same shape: looking in the dim light, like high-shouldered ghosts with their hands in their breeches pockets.Coffin-plates, elm-chips, bright-headed nails, and shreds of black cloth, lay scattered on the floor; and the wall behind the counter was ornamented with a lively representation of two mutes in very stiff neckcloths, on duty at a large private door, with a hearse drawn by four black steeds, approaching in the distance.The shop was close and hot.The atmosphere seemed tainted with the smell of coffins.The recess beneath the counter in which his flock mattress was thrust, looked like a grave."
"令奥利弗感到沮丧的，并不是这些阴沉的感觉。他独自一人待在一个奇怪的地方，我们都知道在这样的情况下，就算是我们中间最出色的人，有时也会感到特别寒冷孤寂。这个孩子没有朋友可照料，也没有朋友来照料他。他最近没有经历什么分离，由此产生的遗憾充斥着他的心灵；他也没有人去爱，去怀念，这种缺失感深深沉入他的心底。","Nor were these the only dismal feelings which depressed Oliver.He was alone in a strange place; and we all know how chilled and desolate the best of us will sometimes feel in such a situation.The boy had no friends to care for, or to care for him.The regret of no recent separation was fresh in his mind; the absence of no loved and well-remembered face sank heavily into his heart."
"尽管如此，他的心情还是很沉重，在他爬进自己狭窄床铺的时候，希望那就是他的棺材，这样他就能躺在教堂墓地里平静地长眠了，高高的野草在他头顶轻轻摆动，古老浑厚的钟声让他安眠。","But his heart was heavy, notwithstanding; and he wished, as he crept into his narrow bed, that that were his coffin, and that he could be lain in a calm and lasting sleep in the churchyard ground, with the tall grass waving gently above his head, and the sound of the old deep bell to soothe him in his sleep."
"奥利弗一大早就被铺子门外一阵巨大的踢门声吵醒，在他胡乱穿好衣服前，这愤怒猛烈的声音重复了大概二十五次。他开始解门链的时候，踢门声停了下来，一个声音说道：","Oliver was awakened in the morning, by a loud kicking at the outside of the shop-door: which, before he could huddle on his clothes, was repeated, in an angry and impetuous manner, about twenty-five times.When he began to undo the chain, the legs desisted, and a voice began."
"“开门，行不行？”一个声音大喊道，它和刚刚踢门的两条腿属于同一个人。","“Open the door, will yer?” cried the voice which belonged to the legs which had kicked at the door."
"“行，马上，先生。”奥利弗答道，解开门链，转动钥匙。","“I will, directly, sir,” replied Oliver: undoing the chain, and turning the key."
"“我想你就是那个新来的男孩，是不是？”这声音从钥匙孔传进来。","“I suppose yer the new boy, ain’t yer?” said the voice through the key-hole."
"“是的，先生。”奥利弗回答。","“Yes, sir,” replied Oliver."
"“你多大了？”那声音问。","“How old are yer?” inquired the voice."
"“十岁，先生。”奥利弗又答。","“Ten, sir,” replied Oliver."
"“那我进来要痛打你一顿，”这声音说，“你就看看我打不打吧，就这样，济贫院的小鬼！”做出这个体贴的承诺后，这声音开始吹起了口哨。","“Then I’ll whop yer when I get in,” said the voice; “you just see if I don’t, that’s all, my work’us brat!” and, having made this obliging promise, the voice began to whistle."
"与“打”这个极具表现力的单音节词相关联的那个过程，奥利弗经受过很多次了，他对这声音的主人毫不怀疑，不管他是谁，肯定会非常体面地履行他的诺言的。他用一只颤抖的手拉起门闩，打开了门。","Oliver had been too often subjected to the process to which the very expressive monosyllable just recorded bears reference, to entertain the smallest doubt that the owner of the voice, whoever he might be, would redeem his pledge, most honourably.He drew back the bolts with a trembling hand, and opened the door."
"奥利弗朝街两头看了一两秒钟，又看了看对面，觉得刚才透过钥匙孔讲话的陌生人肯定走到几步开外暖身子去了。因为他什么人也没看到，只看到一个高大的慈善学校学生，坐在屋子前面的柱子上吃一片黄油面包，他用一把折叠式小刀把面包切成嘴巴大小的楔形，再无比灵巧地吃掉。","For a second or two, Oliver glanced up the street, and down the street, and over the way: impressed with the belief that the unknown, who had addressed him through the key-hole, had walked a few paces off, to warm himself;for nobody did he see but a big charity-boy, sitting on a post in front of the house, eating a slice of bread and butter: which he cut into wedges, the size of his mouth, with a clasp-knife, and then consumed with great dexterity."
"“对不起，先生，”看见没有其他访客出现，奥利弗最后说，“刚才是你在敲门吗？”","“I beg your pardon, sir,” said Oliver at length: seeing that no other visitor made his appearance; “did you knock?”"
"“是我在踢门。”慈善学校学生回答道。","“I kicked,” replied the charity-boy."
"“你想要一口棺材吗，先生？”奥利弗天真地问道。","“Did you want a coffin, sir?” inquired Oliver, innocently."
"听到这话，慈善学校学生变得恐怖暴躁，并且说要是奥利弗用那样的方式和他的老板插科打诨，他不久就需要一口了。","At this, the charity-boy looked monstrous fierce; and said that Oliver would want one before long, if he cut jokes with his superiors in that way."
"“我想，你不知道我是谁，济贫院来的？”慈善学校学生从柱头上下来，带着一副谆谆善诱的庄重神情。","“Yer don't know who I am, I suppose, Work’us?” said the charity-boy, in continuation: descending from the top of the post, meanwhile, with edifying gravity."
"“是的，先生。”奥利弗回答。","“No, sir,” rejoined Oliver."
"“我是诺亚·克雷波尔先生，”慈善学校学生说，“你归我管。把门板放下来，你这个懒惰的小流氓！”克雷波尔先生说着，给了奥利弗一脚，然后神气十足地走进铺子，这副神情为他增色不少。在任何情况下，要让一个头大眼睛小、身形笨重、面容呆滞的年轻人看起来庄重神气都是很难的，除了上述的这些个人魅力之外，再加上红红的鼻头和黄色的内衣裤，就更难了。","“I’m Mister Noah Claypole,” said the charity-boy, “and you’re under me.Take down the shutters, yer idle young ruffian!”With this, Mr. Claypole administered a kick to Oliver, and entered the shop with a dignified air, which did him great credit.It is difficult for a large-headed, small-eyed youth, of lumbering make and heavy countenance, to look dignified under any circumstances; but it is more especially so, when superadded to these personal attractions are a red nose and yellow smalls."
"奥利弗放下门板，要把它们搬到房子一侧的小院子里，门板白天都放在那儿。但当他勉力蹒跚而行，刚搬第一块木板的时候，就撞破了一块窗玻璃。然后诺亚赏脸帮了把手：诺亚先拿“他肯定得受罚”的保证安慰了他，这才屈尊帮他。苏尔伯雷先生不一会儿就下来了。又过了一会儿，苏尔伯雷夫人出现了。诺亚的语言果然应验了，奥利弗“受罚”了，然后他跟着那位年轻的绅士下楼吃早饭。“到炉火边上来，诺亚。”夏洛特说，“我从主人的早餐里给你留了一小块熏肉。奥利弗，把诺亚先生背后的那扇门关上，把我放在面包盘盖子上的东西吃了。这是你的茶，把它拿到箱子那儿去喝掉，快点，他们还要让你照看铺子。听见了没？”","Oliver, having taken down the shutters, and broken a pane of glass in his effort to stagger away beneath the weight of the first one to a small court at the side of the house in which they were kept during the day, was graciously assisted by Noah: who having consoled him with the assurance that “he’d catch it,” condescended to help him.Mr. Sowerberry came down soon after.Shortly afterwards, Mrs. Sowerberry appeared.Oliver having “caught it,” in fulfilment of Noah’s prediction, followed that young gentleman down the stairs to breakfast. “Come near the fire, Noah,” said Charlotte.“I saved a nice little bit of bacon for you from master’s breakfast. Oliver, shut that door at Mister Noah’s back, and take them bits that I’ve  put out on the cover of the bread-pan.There’s your tea; take it away to that box, and drink it there, and make haste, for they’ll want you to mind the shop.D’ye hear?”"
"“听到没，济贫院来的？”诺亚·克雷波尔说。","“D’ye hear, Work’us?” said Noah Claypole."
"“上帝，诺亚！”夏洛特说，“你可真是个怪胎！你干吗理他？”","“Lor, Noah!” said Charlotte, “what a rum creature you are!Why don’t you let the boy alone?”"
"“不理他！”诺亚说，“在这事上，所有人都太放任他了。不论是他爸还是他妈都不会来干预他。他所有的亲戚也不怎么管他。嗯，夏洛特？嘻！嘻！嘻！”","“Let him alone!” said Noah.“Why everybody lets him alone enough, for the matter of that.Neither his father nor his mother will ever interfere with him.All his relations let him have his own way pretty well.Eh, Charlotte? He! he! he!”"
"“噢，你这怪人！”夏洛特说着，开始放声大笑，诺亚也跟着笑起来，之后他们俩一起轻蔑地看着可怜的奥利弗·特威斯特，他正在房间最阴冷的角落里，坐在箱子上发抖，吃着特别留给他的不新鲜的食物。","“Oh, you queer soul!” said Charlotte, bursting into a hearty laugh, in which she was joined by Noah; after which they both looked scornfully at poor Oliver Twist, as he sat shivering on the box in the coldest corner of the room, and ate the stale pieces which had been specially reserved for him."
"诺亚是个慈善学校的学生，却不是一个济贫院的孤儿。他不是私生子，因为可以顺着家谱一直查到他生活艰苦的父母，他母亲是个洗衣妇，父亲是个酗酒的老兵，退伍的时候带着一条木腿和一份抚恤金，金额为每天两个半便士，外加一个不值一提的零头。附近店铺里的年轻店员们向来喜欢在大街上，用一些“皮裤”、“慈善学校”之类的不光彩的诨名来羞辱诺亚，诺亚对这些诨名不予回应，照单全收。但是，既然命运在他面前扔下一个无名无姓的孤儿，即使最卑贱的人也能轻蔑地指责他，他便在他身上加倍地骂了回来。这实在值得深思。它向我们表明，人的本性是多么美好，而同一种和蔼可亲的品质又是如何不偏不倚地在最出色的贵族和最肮脏的慈善学校学生身上发扬光大。","Noah was a charity-boy, but not a workhouse orphan.No chance-child was he, for he could trace his genealogy all the way back to his parents, who lived hard by; his mother being a washerwoman, and his father a drunken soldier, discharged with a wooden leg, and a diurnal pension of twopence-halfpenny and an unstateable fraction.The shop-boys in the neighbourhood had long been in the habit of branding Noah in the public streets, with the ignominious epithets of “leathers,” “charity,” and the like; and Noah had bourne them without reply.But, now that fortune had cast in his way a nameless orphan, at whom even the meanest could point the finger of scorn, he retorted on him with interest. This affords charming food for contemplation.It shows us what a beautiful thing human nature may be made to be; and how impartially the same amiable qualities are developed in the finest lord and the dirtiest charity-boy."
"奥利弗在殡葬承办人那儿呆了大约三到四周了。苏尔伯雷夫妇关了店门，正在后面的小会客室里吃晚饭，苏尔伯雷先生毕恭毕敬地看了他妻子几眼，说道：“我亲爱的——”他本想接着说，但是，苏尔伯雷夫人神色十分不善地抬头瞥了他一眼，他立刻停了下来。","Oliver had been sojourning at the undertaker’s some three weeks or a month.Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry—the shop being shut up—were taking their supper in the little back-parlour, when Mr. Sowerberry, after several deferential glances at his wife, said, “My dear—” He was going to say more; but, Mrs. Sowerberry looking up, with a peculiarly unpropitious aspect, he stopped short."
"“哟。”苏尔伯雷夫人尖刻地说。","“Well,” said Mrs. Sowerberry, sharply."
"“没什么，我亲爱的，没什么。”苏尔伯雷先生说。","“Nothing, my dear, nothing,” said Mr. Sowerberry."
"“呸，你这畜生！”苏尔伯雷夫人说。","“Ugh, you brute!” said Mrs. Sowerberry."
"“一点也不，我亲爱的。”苏尔伯雷先生恭顺地说，“我以为你不想听，我亲爱的。我只是想说——”“噢，别告诉我你想说什么。”苏尔伯雷夫人插嘴道，“我什么也不是，别跟我商量，拜托。我不想打听你的秘密。”苏尔伯雷夫人这么说着，歇斯底里地大笑起来，这预示着将会产生严重的后果。","“Not at all, my dear,” said Mr. Sowerberry humbly.“I thought you didn’t want to hear, my dear.I was only going to say—” “Oh, don’t tell me what you were going to say,” interposed Mrs. Sowerberry.“I am nobody; don’t consult me, pray.I don’t want to intrude upon your secrets.”As Mrs. Sowerberry said this, she gave an hysterical laugh, which threatened violent consequences."
"“但是，我亲爱的，”苏尔伯雷说，“我想问问你的意见。”","“But, my dear,” said Sowerberry, “I want to ask your advice.”"
"“不，不，别问我的意见，”苏尔伯雷夫人用一种感人的态度回答，“问别人去吧。”这时，又一阵歇斯底里的大笑，这可把苏尔伯雷先生吓坏了。这是夫妻之间一种非常普遍并受到广泛认同的相处方法，总是非常有效。苏尔伯雷先生马上沦落到只有求饶的份儿，希望得到一种特殊的恩惠，能被允许说话，而苏尔伯雷夫人其实非常想听。一小段时间之后，这项请求被苏尔伯雷夫人大发慈悲地恩准了。","“No, no, don’t ask mine,” replied Mrs. Sowerberry, in an affecting manner: “ask somebody else’s.”Here, there was another hysterical laugh, which frightened Mr. Sowerberry very much.This is a very common and much-approved matrimonial course of treatment, which is often very effective.It at once reduced Mr. Sowerberry to begging, as a special favour, to be allowed to say what Mrs. Sowerberry was most curious to hear.After a short duration, the permission was most graciously conceded."
"“这只是跟小奥利弗有关，我亲爱的。”苏尔伯雷先生说道，“这孩子长得相当不错，我亲爱的。”","“It’s s only about young Twist, my dear,” said Mr. Sowerberry.“A very good-looking boy, that, my dear.”"
"“他必须得这样，因为他吃得够饱。”女士评论道。","“He need be, for he eats enough,” observed the lady."
"“他脸上有一种忧郁的神情，我亲爱的，”苏尔伯雷先生继续说，“这很有意思。他会成为一个讨人喜欢的送葬人的，我亲爱的。”","“There’s an expression of melancholy in his face, my dear,” resumed Mr. Sowerberry, “which is very interesting.He would make a delightful mute, my love.”"
"苏尔伯雷夫人带着一副相当惊讶的表情抬起头来。苏尔伯雷先生注意到了这一点，没给这位好夫人留下插嘴的时间，便继续说道：","Mrs. Sowerberry looked up with an expression of considerable wonderment.Mr. Sowerberry remarked it and, without allowing time for any observation on the good lady’s part, proceeded."
"“我不是指参加成人葬礼的正式送葬人，我亲爱的，只是给儿童送葬。使用与死者年龄相称的送葬人是很新鲜的事，我亲爱的。你可以对此放心，肯定效果绝佳。”","“I don’t mean a regular mute to attend grown-up people, my dear, but only for children’s practice.It would be very new to have a mute in proportion, my dear.You may depend upon it, it would have a superb effect.”"
"苏尔伯雷夫人对丧葬事宜很有品位，她被这个新奇的主意镇住了，但是承认这一点会有损她的尊严，在现有情况下，她只是非常严厉地问，这样一个显而易见的点子，她的丈夫为什么以前没想到过呢？苏尔伯雷先生理所当然地把这理解为对他建议的默许，事情马上定了下来，因此，奥利弗应该马上开始初步了解这一行的奥秘，为了达到这个目的，下一次他的师傅有生意的时候，他应当陪同前去。","Mrs. Sowerberry, who had a good deal of taste in the undertaking way, was much struck by the novelty of this idea; but, as it would have been compromising her dignity to have said so, under existing circumstances, she merely inquired, with much sharpness, why such an obvious suggestion had not presented itself to her husband’s mind before?Mr. Sowerberry rightly construed this, as an acquiescence in his proposition; it was speedily determined, therefore, that Oliver should be at once initiated into the mysteries of the trade; and, with this view, that he should accompany his master on the very next occasion of his services being required."
"没过多久时机就到了。第二天吃完早饭半小时后，邦布尔先生进来了，他把手杖支在柜台上，抽出他那个皮面的大笔记本，从里面挑出一小片纸，递给了苏尔伯雷。","The occasion was not long in coming.Half an hour after breakfast next morning, Mr. Bumble entered the shop; and supporting his cane against the counter, drew forth his large leathern pocket-book: from which he selected a small scrap of paper, which he handed over to Sowerberry."
"“啊哈！”殡葬承办人表情生动地扫了一眼那张纸，说道，“订一口棺材，嗯？”","“Aha!” said the undertaker, glancing over it with a lively countenance; “an order for a coffin, eh?”"
"“先来一口棺材，之后还有一场教区葬礼。”邦布尔先生一边回答，一边扣上皮面笔记本的扣子，这本子和他本人一样肥大。","“For a coffin first, and a porochial funeral afterwards,” replied Mr. Bumble, fastening the strap of the leathern pocket-book: which, like himself, was very corpulent."
"“贝登，”殡葬承办人看看这张纸，再看向邦布尔先生，“我以前从没听过这个名字。”","“Bayton,” said the undertaker, looking from the scrap of paper to Mr. Bumble.“I never heard the name before.”"
"邦布尔摇摇头，回答说：“这是个很固执的人，苏尔伯雷先生，非常固执。恐怕还很傲慢，先生。”","Bumble shook his head, as he replied, “Obstinate people, Mr. Sowerberry; very obstinate.Proud, too, I’m afraid, sir.”"
"“傲慢，嗯？”苏尔伯雷先生嗤笑着，大声说道，“嗨，那可太过分了。”","“Proud, eh?” exclaimed Mr. Sowerberry with a sneer.“Come, that’s too much.”"
"“噢，这令人作呕。”教区助理回答。“真缺德，苏尔伯雷先生！”","“Oh, it’s sickening,” replied the beadle.“Antimonial, Mr. Sowerberry!”"
"“是这样。”殡葬承办人表示赞同。","“So it is,” asquiesced the undertaker."
"“我们也是前天晚上才听说了这户人家，”教区执事说，“我们本来也不知道任何关于他们的事情，只是有个住在同一栋房子的女人向教区委员会申请，请他们派教区医生去看看一个病得很重的女人。医生出去吃饭了，但那时他的学徒（是个很聪明的小伙子）随便在黑色鞋油瓶子里装了点药，给了他们。”","“We only heard of the family the night before last,” said the beadle; “and we shouldn’t have known anything about them, then, only a woman who lodges in the same house made an application to the porochial committee for them to send the porochial surgeon to see a woman as was very bad.He had gone out to dinner; but his ’prentice (which is a very clever lad) sent ’em some medicine in a blacking-bottle, offhand.”"
"“啊，真迅速。”殡葬承办人说道。","“Ah, there’s promptness,” said the undertaker."
"“迅速，确实是！”教区执事回答。“但是结果怎么样，这些反叛者都干了些什么忘恩负义的事，先生？唔，那丈夫传话回来，说教区给他妻子的药不对症，所以她不会服用——他说她不会服用，先生！那上等、有效又卫生的药，仅仅在一周之前，曾经非常成功地开给了两个爱尔兰工人和一个运煤工人——现在装在黑色鞋油瓶子里白给他们——他却传话回来说她不会服用，先生！”","“Promptness, indeed!” replied the beadle.“But what’s the consequence; what’s the ungrateful behaviour of these rebels, sir?Why, the husband sends back word that the medicine won’t suit his wife’s complaint, and so she shan’t take it—says she shan’t take it, sir!Good, strong, wholesome medicine, as was given with great success to two Irish labourers and a coal-heaver, only a week before—sent ’em for nothing, with a blacking-bottle in,—and he sends back word that she shan’t take it, sir!”"
"邦布尔先生心里想起这暴行，猛烈地用手杖敲着柜台，因为愤慨而满脸通红。","As the atrocity presented itself to Mr. Bumble’s mind in full force, he struck the counter sharply with his cane, and became flushed with indignation."
"“嗯，”殡葬承办人说，“我从——来——没——有——”“从来没有，先生！”教区执事突然叫道。“不，从没有人这样过，但是现在她死了，我们还得埋葬她，这是指示，这事越快办完越好。”","“Well,” said the undertaker, “I ne—ver—did—” “Never did, sir!” ejaculated the beadle.“No, nor nobody never did; but now she’s dead, we’ve  got to bury her; and that’s the direction; and the sooner it’s done, the better.”"
"邦布尔先生这么说着，因为教区的事而处于高度兴奋之中，一开始把三角帽都戴反了，愤然快步离开了铺子。","Thus saying, Mr. Bumble put on his cocked hat wrong side first, in a fever of parochial excitement; and flounced out of the shop."
"“哎呀，他这么生气，奥利弗，甚至都忘了询问你的情况了！”苏尔伯雷先生说着，目送教区执事沿街大步离去。","“Why, he was so angry, Oliver, that he forgot even to ask after you!” said Mr. Sowerberry, looking after the beadle as he strode down the street."
"“是的，先生。”奥利弗在两位先生的会面过程中，小心翼翼地置身于他们的视线之外，只要一想到邦布尔先生的声音，他就从头抖到脚。","“Yes, sir,” replied Oliver, who had carefully kept himself out of sight, during the interview; and who was shaking from head to foot at the mere recollection of the sound of Mr. Bumble’s voice."
"然而，他用不着费心回避邦布尔先生的视线，因为穿白背心的绅士的预言给那位公务员留下了深刻的印象，他认为既然殡葬承办人正在试用奥利弗，就最好对这个话题避而不谈，直到签署了协议，确定了奥利弗将被牢牢拴在这里七年，才能有效合法地避免所有他被退回到教区手上的危险。","He needn’t haven taken the trouble to shrink from Mr. Bumble’s glance, however; for that functionary, on whom the prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat had made a very strong impression, thought that now the undertaker had got Oliver upon trial the subject was better avoided, until such time as he should be firmly bound for seven years, and all danger of his being returned upon the hands of the parish should be thus effectually and legally overcome."
"“好吧，”苏尔伯雷先生拿起帽子说，“这活越快干完越好。诺亚，照看店铺。奥利弗，戴上帽子和我走。”奥利弗服从命令，跟着他的主人去做他的本职工作。","“Well,” said Mr. Sowerberry, taking up his hat, “the sooner this job is done, the better.Noah, look after the shop.Oliver, put on your cap, and come with me.”Oliver obeyed, and followed his master on his professional mission."
"他们走了一会儿，穿过了镇上最拥挤、人口最稠密的居民区，接着走到一条比他们经过的所有道路都更脏更破的窄街，停下来寻找他们目标中的那栋房子。两边的房子都又高又大，却很老旧，房客都是最底层的贫困之人：这些房子被弃置的外表就足以表明这一点，不用再看那几个男女路人抱着胳膊、蜷着身子，间或偷偷摸摸地走过时摆出的一脸苦相。很多房屋都有店铺门面，但是都大门紧闭，渐趋腐朽，只有上面的房间还住着人。一些房屋年久失修，已经摇摇欲坠，由一些大木柱支撑着，以防倒塌在街上，这些木柱一头撑在墙上，一头牢固地插进地里。但即使是这些摇摇欲坠的狗窝般的陋室，似乎也被一些无家可归的可怜人选为了夜间的容身之所。一些充作房子门窗的粗木板被撬离了原位，留下了一条足够一个成人通过的缝隙。这狗窝肮脏发臭。到处都是正在腐烂的老鼠，因为饥饿显得死相狰狞。","They walked on, for some time, through the most crowded and densely inhabited part of the town; and then, striking down a narrow street more dirty and miserable than any they had yet passed through, paused to look for the house which was the object of their search.The houses on either side were high and large, but very old, and tenanted by people of the poorest class: as their neglected appearance would have sufficiently denoted, without the concurrent testimony afforded by the squalid looks of the few men and women who, with folded arms and bodies half doubled, occasionally skulked along.A great many of the tenements had shop-fronts; but these were fast closed, and mouldering away; only the upper rooms being inhabited.Some houses which had become insecure from age and decay, were prevented from falling into the street, by huge beams of wood reared against the walls, and firmly planted in the road; but even these crazy dens seemed to have been selected as the nightly haunts of some houseless wretches, for many of the rough boards which supplied the place of door and window, were wrenched from their positions, to afford an aperture wide enough for the passage of a human body.The kennel was stagnant and filthy.The very rats, which here and there lay putrefying in its rottenness, were hideous with famine."
"奥利弗和他的主人停在一扇敞开的大门前，门上既没有门环也没有门铃把手，所以殡葬承办人小心翼翼地在黑暗的过道里摸索着前进，命令奥利弗跟紧他，不要害怕，然后爬上了第一段楼梯的顶端。在楼梯口他跌跌撞撞地碰上一扇门，接着用指节敲了起来。","There was neither knocker nor bell-handle at the open door where Oliver and his master stopped; so, groping his way cautiously through the dark passage, and bidding Oliver  keep close to him and not be afraid the undertaker mounted to the top of the first flight of stairs.Stumbling against a door on the landing, he rapped at it with his knuckles."
"一个十三四岁的小姑娘开了门。殡葬承办人马上就把屋内的摆设看了个遍，知道这就是他要找的房间。他走进去，奥利弗跟在后面。","It was opened by a young girl of thirteen or fourteen.The undertaker at once saw enough of what the room contained, to know it was the apartment to which he had been directed.He stepped in; Oliver followed him."
"屋里没有生火，一个男人怔怔地蜷缩在空空的炉边。一个老妇人也在冰冷的壁炉边搬了张凳子，坐在他旁边。另一个角落里有几个衣衫褴褛的孩子。在对着门的小壁龛里，有什么东西被一块旧毯子盖着，放在地上。奥利弗的眼光一落到那里，就战栗起来，不自觉地靠近他的主人，因为尽管它被盖住了，他还是能感觉到那是一具尸体。","There was no fire in the room; but a man was crouching, mechanically, over the empty stove.An old woman, too, had drawn a low stool to the cold hearth, and was sitting beside him.There were some ragged children in another corner; and in a small recess, opposite the door, there lay upon the ground, something covered with an old blanket.Oliver shuddered as he cast his eyes toward the place, and crept involuntarily closer to his master; for though it was covered up, the boy felt that it was a corpse."
"那个男人脸庞瘦削，脸色十分苍白，他的头发和胡子都已花白，眼睛布满血丝。老妇人的脸满是皱纹，仅剩的两颗牙伸出来挡住了下嘴唇，双眼炯炯有神。奥利弗不敢去看她和那个男人。他们和奥利弗在外面看到的那些老鼠太像了。","The man’s face was thin and very pale; his hair and beard were grizzly; his eyes were bloodshot.The old woman’s face was wrinkled; her two remaining teeth protruded over her under lip; and her eyes were bright and piercing.Oliver was afraid to look at either her or the man.They seemed so like the rats he had seen outside."
"“谁都不许靠近她。”那男人在殡葬承办人靠近壁龛的时候，气势汹汹地跳了起来。“别靠近！该死的，别靠近，如果你还想要命的话！”","“Nobody shall go near her,” said the man, starting fiercely up, as the undertaker approached the recess.“Keep back!Damn you, keep back, if you’ve  a life to lose!”"
"“别胡说，我的朋友。”殡葬承办人说道，他对各种各样的悲惨境遇已经相当习惯了。“别胡说！”","“Nonsense, my good man,” said the undertaker, who was pretty well used to misery in all its shapes.“Nonsense!”"
"“我告诉你，”男人握紧拳头，猛烈地跺着地板，说道，“我告诉你，我不会让她入土的。她在那儿无法安息。蠕虫会折磨她的——不是吃了她——她已经被掏空了。”","“I tell you,” said the man: clenching his hands, and stamping furiously on the floor,—“I tell you I won’t have her put into the ground.She couldn’t rest there.The worms would worry her—not eat her—she is so worn away.”"
"殡葬承办人没有回答这番胡言乱语，而是从口袋里拿出一副卷尺，在尸体一旁蹲下量了一会儿。","The undertaker offered no reply to this raving; but producing a tape from his pocket, knelt down for a moment by the side of the body."
"“啊！”男人说着，哭了起来，在死去的女人脚边跪了下来，“跪下吧，跪下吧——在她旁边跪下，所有人，注意我说的话！我说她是饿死的。我从不知道她状况这么差，直到她得了热病，后来她瘦得皮都包不住骨头了。没有炉火也没有蜡烛，她在漆黑一片中死去——漆黑一片！她甚至不能看看她孩子们的脸，尽管我们听见她喘着气叫他们的名字。我在街上为她乞讨，他们却把我送进监狱。我回来的时候，她已经要死了，我心里所有的血都干了，因为他们把她活活饿死了。我在上帝面前发誓我看到了！他们把她饿死了！”他两手抓着头发，大声尖叫着在地板上打起了滚，两眼发直，口吐白沫，糊在嘴唇上。","“Ah!” said the man: bursting into tears, and sinking on his knees at the feet of the dead woman; “kneel down, kneel down—kneel round her, every one of you, and mark my words!I say she was starved to death.I never knew how bad she was, till the fever came upon her; and then her bones were starting through the skin.There was neither fire nor candle; she died in the dark—in the dark!She couldn’t even see her children’s faces, though we heard her gasping out their names.I begged for her in the streets: and they sent me to prison.When I came back, she was dying; and all the blood in my heart has dried up, for they starved her to death.I swear it before the God that saw it!They starved her!”He twined his hands in his hair; and, with a loud scream, rolled grovelling upon the floor: his eyes fixed, and the foam covering his lips."
"孩子们被吓坏了，大哭起来，但是那个老妇人像是对发生的一切都听不见似的，迄今为止保持着镇定，威胁着让他们安静下来。男人仍旧横躺在地上，她解开了他的领结，步履蹒跚地走向殡葬承办人。","The terrified children cried bitterly; but the old woman, who had hitherto remained as quiet as if she had been wholly deaf to all that passed, menaced them into silence.Having unloosened the cravat of the man who still remained extended on the ground, she tottered towards the undertaker."
"“她是我女儿。”老妇人朝尸体的方向点了点头，白痴般地斜着眼边看边说道。在这个地方，她这副样子甚至比死亡还要可怕。“上帝，上帝！哎呀，这很古怪，我生下了她，那时我就是个成年妇女了，现在还活得挺快活，而她却躺在那里，又冷又硬！上帝，上帝！——想想吧，这几乎和一出戏一样——就像一出戏！”","“She was my daughter,” said the old woman, nodding her head in the direction of the corpse; and speaking with an idiotic leer, more ghastly than even the presence of death in such a place.“Lord, Lord!Well, it is strange that I who gave birth to her, and was a woman then, should be alive and merry now, and she lying there: so cold and stiff!Lord, Lord!—to think of it; it’s as good as a play—as good as a play!”"
"这可怜的人咕哝着，带着那种可怕的幽默吃吃地笑，殡葬承办人转身离开。","As the wretched creature mumbled and chuckled in her hideous merriment, the undertaker turned to go away."
"“停下，停下！”老妇人大声说。“她会在明天下葬还是后天，或者是今晚？我为她的殡葬做了准备，并且我必须得去，你知道的。给我送件大斗篷，要暖和点的，因为实在太冷啦。在我们去之前，还得来点蛋糕和酒！不用担心，送一些面包——只是一块面包和一杯水。我们能有一点面包吗，亲爱的？”她热切地说着，在殡葬承办人再一次向门走去的时候，她抓住了他的外套。","“Stop, stop!” said the old woman in a loud whisper.“Will she be buried to-morrow, or next day, or to-night?I laid her out; and I must walk, you know.Send me a large cloak: a good warm one: for it is bitter cold.We should have cake and wine, too, before we go!Never mind; send some bread—only a loaf of bread and a cup of water.Shall we have some bread, dear?”  she said eagerly: catching at the undertaker’s coat, as he once more moved towards the door."
"“是的，是的，”殡葬承办人说道，“当然。你想要什么都行！”他从老妇人的拉扯下脱身，拉着奥利弗，然后匆匆离去。","“Yes, yes,” said the undertaker,“of course.Anything you like!”He disengaged himself from the old woman’s grasp; and, drawing Oliver after him, hurried away."
"第二天（其间，这个家庭已经得到了邦布尔先生亲自送来的半个重四磅的面包和一片奶酪的救济），奥利弗和他的主人回到了这个悲惨的住所。邦布尔先生在四个救济院来的男人的陪伴下已经到了，那几个人是来抬棺材的。老妇人和那个男人在褴褛的衣衫外披了件老旧的黑斗篷，光秃秃的棺材已经被拧紧了，抬棺材的人把它扛上肩膀，向街上搬去。","The next day, (the family having been meanwhile relieved with a half-quartern loaf and a piece of cheese, left with them by Mr. Bumble himself,) Oliver and his master returned to the miserable abode; where Mr. Bumble had already arrived, accompanied by four men from the workhouse, who were to act as bearers.An old black cloak had been thrown over the rags of the old woman and the man; and the bare coffin having been screwed down, was hoisted on the shoulders of the bearers, and carried into the street."
"“嗨，你可得走好了，老太太！”苏尔伯雷在老妇人耳边低语，“我们已经有点晚了，让牧师等着可不太合适。走起来，伙计们——能多快就多快！”","“Now, you must put your best leg foremost, old lady!” whispered Sowerberry in the old woman’s ear; “we are rather late; and it won’t do, to keep the clergyman waiting.Move on, my men,—as quick as you like!”"
"接到指示，几个抬棺材的人扛着没什么重量的棺材慢跑起来，两个送葬者尽可能地跟上。邦布尔先生和苏尔伯雷走在前面，步伐十分轻快，奥利弗的腿没有他主人的那么长，就在旁边跑着。","Thus directed, the bearers trotted on under their light burden; and the two mourners kept as near them, as they could.Mr. Bumble and Sowerberry walked at a good smart pace in front; and Oliver, whose legs were not so long as his master’s, ran by the side."
"然而，并没有多大必要像苏尔伯雷先生要求的那样匆忙。因为当他们到达教堂墓地的那个阴暗角落的时候，牧师还没到，角落里长满了荨麻，教区居民的墓就建在那里。神职人员正坐在法衣圣器储藏室的炉火旁，他似乎认为在一个钟头之内，牧师是绝无可能到达的。所以他们把棺材放在坟墓边上，两位送葬者在潮湿的泥地里耐心等待，天空下着冰冷的毛毛细雨，这场景吸引了几个衣衫褴褛的孩子来到墓地，他们在墓碑间闹哄哄地玩着捉迷藏，或是换个玩法，在棺材上跳来跳去。苏尔伯雷先生和邦布尔先生都与神职人员有私交，便和他一起坐在炉火边看着报纸。","There was not so great a necessity for hurrying as Mr. Sowerberry had anticipated, however;for when they reached the obscure corner of the churchyard in which the nettles grew, and where the parish graves were made, the clergyman had not arrived; and the clerk, who was sitting by the vestry-room fire, seemed to think it by no means improbable that it might be an hour or so, before he came.So, they put the bier on the brink of the grave; and the two mourners waited patiently in the damp clay, with a cold rain drizzling down, while the ragged boys whom the spectacle had attracted into the churchyard played a noisy game at hide-and-seek among the tombstones, or varied their amusements by jumping backwards and forwards over the coffin.Mr. Sowerberry and Bumble, being personal friends of the clerk, sat by the fire with him, and read the paper."
"最后，过了一个多小时，邦布尔先生和苏尔伯雷，还有那位神职人员朝坟墓跑去。不一会儿，牧师出现了，边走边穿上他的白色法衣。邦布尔先生赶跑了一两个小男孩，维持了场面，而那位可敬的绅士，把葬礼尽可能缩短到四分钟，宣讲完毕后把法衣递给了神职人员，就又走了。","At length, after a lapse of something more than an hour, Mr. Bumble, and Sowerberry, and the clerk, were seen running towards the grave.Immediately afterwards, the clergyman appeared: putting on his surplice as he came along.Mr. Bumble then thrashed a boy or two, to keep up appearances; and the reverend gentleman, having read as much of the burial service as could be compressed into four minutes, gave his surplice to the clerk, and walked away again."
"“嗨，比尔！”苏尔伯雷对掘墓人说，“填上！”","“Now, Bill!” said Sowerberry to the grave-digger.“Fill up!”"
"这不是个很难的差事，墓穴太满了，棺材最上面离地面只有几尺。掘墓人铲起土来再填进去，用脚松松地踩平，把锄头扛在肩上就走了。后面跟着几个孩子，因为这乐事这么快就结束了而大声咕哝抱怨着。","It was no very difficult task, for the grave was so full, that the uppermost coffin was within a few feet of the surface.The grave-digger shovelled in the earth; stamped it loosely down with his feet: shouldered his spade; and walked off, followed by the boys, who murmured very loud complaints at the fun being over so soon."
"“嗨，老兄！”邦布尔说着，拍拍男人的背，“他们要关墓地了。”","“Come, my good fellow!” said Bumble, tapping the man on the back.“They want to shut up the yard.”"
"那男人自打在坟墓边上站定，就再也没动过，他猛地抬起头来，盯着和他说话的人，往前走了几步，接着昏厥在地。疯癫的老妇人光顾着为失去斗篷而伤心（殡葬承办人把它拿走了），没注意到他，于是他们对着这个男人泼了一罐冷水，他醒过来后，他们看他安然走出墓地，就锁了门，各自离去。","The man who had never once moved, since he had taken his station by the grave side, started, raised his head, stared at the person who had addressed him, walked forward for a few paces; and fell down in a swoon.The crazy old woman was too much occupied in bewailing the loss of her cloak (which the undertaker had taken off), to pay him any attention; so they threw a can of cold water over him; and when he came to, saw him safely out of the churchyard, locked the gate, and departed on their different ways."
"“唔，奥利弗，”苏尔伯雷在回家的路上问道，“你觉得怎么样？”","“Well, Oliver,” said Sowerberry, as they walked home, “how do you like it?”"
"“挺好，谢谢你，先生。”奥利弗犹豫了好一会儿后回答道，“不是特别喜欢，先生。”","“Pretty well, thank you, sir,” replied Oliver, with considerable hesitation.“Not very much, sir.”"
"“啊，你迟早会习惯的，奥利弗。”苏尔伯雷说道，“等你习惯了就没什么了，我的孩子。”","“Ah, you’ll get used to it in time, Oliver,” said Sowerberry.“Nothing when you are used to it, my boy.”"
"奥利弗在心里纳闷，苏尔伯雷先生是不是也花了好长时间才习惯这件事。但他想最好还是别问这个问题了，仔细想着自己的所见所闻，他走回了铺子。","Oliver wondered, in his own mind, whether it had taken a very long time to get Mr. Sowerberry used to it.But he thought it better not to ask the question; and walked back to the shop: thinking over all he had seen and heard."

"一个月的试用期结束了，奥利弗正式成为了学徒。此时正是疾病肆虐的好季节。用商业用语来说，就是棺材正在涨价。在短短几周的时间里，奥利弗积累了大量经验。苏尔伯雷先生别出心裁的点子大获成功，甚至超出了他最乐观的估计。最年长的居民都想不起来还有什么时候麻疹像现在这样盛行过，很多小孩子因此送了命。小奥利弗多次率众走在送葬队伍前头，帽子上系着一条直拖到膝盖的黑带子，这让镇上所有的母亲都有种说不出的赞赏和激动。奥利弗也随他的主人参加了大部分成人的送葬队伍，这是为了让他获得镇定的风度和自控能力，这些对一位完美的送葬人来说是至关重要的。这时他有很多机会去观察一些意志坚强的人在承受考验和损失的时候，所展示出的令人钦佩的达观的态度和坚韧的精神。","The month’s trial over, Oliver was formally apprenticed.It was a nice sickly season just at this time.In commercial phrase, coffins were looking up; and, in the course of a few weeks, Oliver acquired a great deal of experience.The success of Mr. Sowerberry’s ingenious speculation, exceeded even his most sanguine hopes.The oldest inhabitants recollected no period at which measles had been so prevalent, or so fatal to infant existence; and many were the mournful processions which little Oliver headed, in a hat-band reaching down to his knees, to the indescribable admiration and emotion of all the mothers in the town.As Oliver accompanied his master in most of his adult expeditions too, in order that he might acquire that equanimity of demeanour and full command of nerve which was essential to a finished undertaker, he had many opportunities of observing the beautiful resignation and fortitude with which some strong-minded people bear their trials and losses."
"例如：苏尔伯雷先生奉命为一位富有的老太太或老先生举行葬礼，死者身边围着很多侄儿侄女，他们在死者生病期间伤心欲绝，在大多数公共场合他们也完全无法抑制自己的悲痛，私下里却是要多开心有多开心——相当兴高采烈、心满意足——他们快活地在一起聊天，无拘无束，就好像压根没有发生过什么烦心事一样。丈夫们也以最英勇的状态沉着冷静地忍受丧妻之痛。妻子们为丈夫穿上丧服，远非出于自身的悲痛，而似乎是下定决心要把这一身给丈夫尽量穿得既得体又迷人。还看得出来那些在葬礼仪式上极度痛苦的女士先生们，几乎一到家就马上恢复过来了，还没等喝完茶就又变得相当泰然自若了。所有这些看起来都令人愉快，颇有教益，奥利弗怀着极度钦佩之情把这些看在眼里。","For instance; when Sowerberry had an order for the burial of some rich old lady or gentleman, who was surrounded by a great number of nephews and nieces, who had been perfectly inconsolable during the previous illness, and whose grief had been wholly irrepressible even on the most public occasions, they would be as happy among themselves as need be—quite cheerful and contented—conversing together with as much freedom and gaiety, as if nothing whatever had happened to disturb them.Husbands, too, bore the loss of their wives with the most heroic calmness.Wives, again, put on weeds for their husbands, as if, so far from grieving in the garb of sorrow, they had made up their minds to render it as becoming and attractive as possible.It was observable, too, that ladies and gentlemen who were in passions of anguish during the ceremony of interment, recovered almost as soon as they reached home, and became quite composed before the tea-drinking was over.All this was very pleasant and improving to see; and Oliver beheld it with great admiration."
"尽管我是奥利弗·特威斯特的传记作者，我也没有丝毫的信心来担保，在这些好人榜样的影响下他变得听天由命了。但是我可以毫不含糊地说，他几个月来一直顺从地忍受着诺亚·克雷波尔的支配和虐待。他对待奥利弗比以前厉害多了，因为他看到这个新来的男孩已经提升到了拥有黑手杖和帽带的地位，而自己资历比他老，却还是戴着松饼帽，穿着皮裤，没有任何长进，不由对奥利弗产生了嫉妒之意。夏洛特对他也不好，因为诺亚这么做；苏尔伯雷夫人是奥利弗的死敌，因为苏尔伯雷先生想和他成为朋友；所以，一边有这三位，另一边有一大堆葬礼，奥利弗活得还不如一头挨饿的猪，特别是当他被错关进酿酒厂谷仓里的时候。现在，我写到了奥利弗往事中非常重要的一段，这一幕看起来可能微不足道，却间接给他未来的所有景象和前程都带来了重要变化。","That Oliver Twist was moved to resignation by the example of these good people, I cannot, although I am his biographer, undertake to affirm with any degree of confidence; but I can most distinctly say, that for many months he continued meekly to submit to the domination and ill-treatment of Noah Claypole:who used him far worse than before, now that his jealousy was roused by seeing the new boy promoted to the black stick and hatband, while he, the old one, remained stationary in the muffin-cap and leathers.Charlotte treated him ill, because Noah did; and Mrs. Sowerberry was his decided enemy, because Mr. Sowerberry was disposed to be his friend; so, between these three on one side, and a glut of funerals on the other, Oliver was not altogether as comfortable as the hungry pig was, when he was shut up, by mistake, in the grain department of a brewery.And now, I come to a very important passage in Oliver’s history; for I have to record an act, slight and unimportant perhaps in appearance, but which indirectly produced a material change in all his future prospects and proceedings."
"一天，奥利弗和诺亚在平时吃晚饭的时间下楼来到厨房，来享用一小块羊肉——一磅半脖子上最差的一段——那会儿夏洛特被叫出去了，接下来有一个短暂的时间间隔，诺亚·克雷波尔又饿又凶，想想也没有什么更有价值的事情好做，还是逗一逗小奥利弗·特威斯特，把他惹生气吧。诺亚下定决心要进行这项无害的娱乐，他把双脚放在桌布上，拉扯奥利弗的头发，揪他的耳朵，并且发表了奥利弗是个“鬼鬼祟祟的人”的看法，此外还宣布打算将来要看他上绞架，不论那件令人向往的事情什么时候发生，他又讲了很多相当令人讨厌的事情，把一个恶毒而坏脾气的慈善学校男生能想出来的都说了。但是，要让奥利弗哭出来，诺亚还得努力尝试变得更诙谐；尽管很多人有些小聪明，名气也比诺亚大得多，他们想逗趣时往往会采取一种做法，而诺亚也这么做了；他开始对奥利弗进行人身攻击。“济贫院来的，”诺亚说，“你妈妈呢？”“她死了。”奥利弗回答，“不要对我说关于她的任何事！”","One day, Oliver and Noah had descended into the kitchen at the usual dinner-hour, to banquet upon a small joint of mutton—a pound and a half of the worst end of the neck—when Charlotte being called out of the way, there ensued a brief interval of time, which Noah Claypole, being hungry and vicious, considered he could not possibly devote to a worthier purpose than aggravating and tantalising young Oliver Twist.Intent upon this innocent amusement, Noah put his feet on the table-cloth; and pulled Oliver’s hair; and twitched his ears; and expressed his opinion that he was a “sneak”; and furthermore announced his intention of coming to see him hanged, whenever that desirable event should take place; and entered upon various topics of petty annoyance, like a malicious and ill-conditioned charity-boy as he was.But, making Oliver cry, Noah attempted to be more facetious still; and in his attempt, did what many small wits, with far greater reputations than Noah, notwithstanding, do to this day when they want to be funny; he got rather personal.“Work’us ,” said Noah, “how’s your mother?”“She’s dead,” replied Oliver; “don’t you say anything about her to me!”"
"奥利弗说这话的时候涨红了脸，呼吸急促，他的嘴巴和鼻子奇怪地动着，克雷波尔先生认为那是一场号啕大哭即将来临的前兆。在这种想法之下，他重新获得了主动权。","Oliver’s colour rose as he said this; he breathed quickly; and there was a curious working of the mouth and nostrils, which Mr. Claypole thought must be the immediate precursor of a violent fit of crying.Under this impression he returned to the charge."
"“她怎么死的，济贫院来的？”诺亚问道。","“What did she die of, Work’us?” said Noah."
"“因为心碎死的，有个老护士告诉我的。”奥利弗答道，与其说他在回答诺亚，倒不如说他是在对自己说话。“我想我知道那样死去是怎么回事。”","“Of a broken heart, some of our old nurses told me,” replied Oliver: more as if he were talking to himself, than answering Noah.“I think I know what it must be to die of that!”"
"“咜嘚啰啰啰，真是太蠢了，济贫院来的。”诺亚这么说着的时候，一滴泪珠从奥利弗的脸上滑落。“是什么让你这么哭哭啼啼的？”","“Tol de rol lol lol, right fol lairy, Work’us,” said Noah, as a tear rolled down Oliver ’s cheek.“What’s set you a snivelling now?”"
"“不是你。”奥利弗尖声回答，“好了，够了。别再跟我说任何有关她的事情了。你最好不要！”","“Not you,” replied Oliver, sharply.“There; that’s enough.Don’t say anything more to me about her; you’d better not!”"
"“最好不要！”诺亚惊叫，“哟！最好不要！济贫院来的，别太不要脸了。你妈妈也是！她是个美人，是这样。噢，上帝！”说到这儿，诺亚意味深长地点点头，同时还用尽全力把他的小红鼻头皱起来，","“Better not!” exclaimed Noah.“Well!Better not!Work’us, don’t be impudent.Your mother, too!She was a nice ’un she was.Oh, Lor!”And here, Noah nodded his head expressively; and curled up as much of his small red nose as muscular action could collect together, for the occasion."
"“你知道，济贫院来的，”奥利弗的沉默鼓舞了诺亚，他继续说道，嘲讽的语气里带着装出来的同情，这是所有语气中最讨厌的，“你知道，济贫院来的，现在你帮不上忙了，当然那时你也帮不上，我很抱歉，我相信大家都很抱歉，也特别同情你。但是你得知道，济贫院来的，你妈妈是个彻彻底底的贱女人。”","“Yer know, Work’us,” continued Noah, emboldened by Oliver’s silence, and speaking in a jeering tone of affected pity: of all tones the most annoying: “Yer know, Work’us, it can’t be helped now; and of course yer couldn’t help it then; and I am very sorry for it; and I’m sure we all are, and pity yer very much.But yer must know, Work’us, yer mother was a regular right-down bad ’un.”"
"“你说什么？”奥利弗飞快地抬起头来问道。","“What did you say?” inquired Oliver, looking up very quickly."
"“一个彻彻底底的贱女人，济贫院来的。”诺亚冷冷地回答，“而且那样真是好多了，济贫院来的，她死的真是时候，要不然她就得去感化院做苦工，或者被流放，再不然就得被绞死，这种结果比其他两个更有可能，是不是？”","“A regular right-down bad ’un, Work’us,” replied Noah, coolly.“And it’s a great deal better, Work’us, that she died when she did, or else she’d have been hard labouring in Bridewell, or transported, or hung; which is more likely than either, isn’t it?”"
"奥利弗气得脸变成了深红色，他猛地跳了起来，推翻桌椅，一把扼住诺亚的咽喉，拼了命地疯狂摇晃；奥利弗气得直咬牙，直把牙齿咬得咯嘣作响，这时他用尽全身力气给了诺亚重重一击，把他摔倒在地。","Crimson with fury, Oliver started up; overthrew the chair and table; seized Noah by the throat; shook him, in the violence of his rage, till his teeth chattered in his head; and collecting his whole force into one heavy blow, felled him to the ground."
"一分钟前，这个男孩看起来还是个安静的孩子，是个因为饱受虐待而温和顺从、闷闷不乐的人。但终于，他的脾气被激发出来了，诺亚对他死去的母亲的残酷侮辱让他怒火中烧。他站得直直的，胸膛剧烈起伏，眼睛明亮有神，他站在那儿，愤怒地瞪着那个怯懦的施虐者，现在他蜷伏在他脚边；奥利弗整个人都变了，他以一种前所未有的力量挑战了诺亚。","A minute ago, the boy had looked the quiet child, mild, dejected creature that harsh treatment had made him.But his spirit was roused at last; the cruel insult to his dead mother had set his blood on fire.His breast heaved; his attitude was erect; his eye bright and vivid; his whole person changed, as he stood glaring over the cowardly tormentor who now lay crouching at his feet; and defied him with an energy he had never known before."
"“他会杀了我的！”诺亚号啕大哭，“夏洛特！夫人！新来的男孩儿要杀了我！救命！救命！奥利弗发疯啦！夏——洛特！”","“He’ll murder me!” blubbered Noah.“Charlotte! missis!Here’s the new boy a-murdering of me!Help! help!Oliver’s gone mad!Char—lotte!”"
"诺亚的叫声得到了回应，夏洛特尖叫了一声，而苏尔伯雷夫人叫得比她还响。前者从一扇侧门冲进了厨房，后者在楼梯上停下，直到她相当确信去厨房不会危及自己的性命，这才又往下走去。","Noah’s shouts were responded to, by a loud scream from Charlotte, and a louder from Mrs. Sowerberry; the former of whom rushed into the kitchen by a side-door, while the latter paused on the staircase till she was quite certain that it was consistent with the preservation of human life, to come further down."
"“噢，你这个小流氓！”夏洛特尖叫着，用最大的力气抓住奥利弗，那力气堪比一个受过特别训练的相当强壮的男人。“噢，你这个小没——良——心的，杀——人——犯，可——怕的恶棍！”每说一个音节，夏洛特就用尽全力揍奥利弗一下，并发出一声声尖叫，这都是为了在场人的利益。","“Oh, you little wretch!” screamed Charlotte: seizing Oliver with her utmost force, which was about equal to that of a moderately strong man in particularly good training.“Oh, you little un-grate-ful, mur-de-rous, hor-rid villain!”And between every syllable, Charlotte gave Oliver a blow with all her might: accompanying it with a scream, for the benefit of society."
"夏洛特的拳头绝对算不上轻，但是，惟恐它没法有效地平息奥利弗的怒火，苏尔伯雷夫人冲进厨房，一只手帮着抓住他，另一只手在他脸上乱抓一气。在这种有利形势下，诺亚从地上爬起来，从后面连续用拳头揍奥利弗。","Charlotte’s fist was by no means a light one; but, lest it should not be effectual in calming Oliver’s wrath, Mrs. Sowerberry plunged into the kitchen, and assisted to hold him with one hand, while she scratched his face with the other.In this favourable position of affairs, Noah rose from the ground, and pommelled him behind."
"这种暴力的运动没法持续太久。当他们都累得精疲力竭，没力气再厮打了，就把不断挣扎叫喊却毫不气馁的奥利弗拖进了放垃圾的地窖，锁了起来。干完这事，苏尔伯雷夫人瘫在椅子上，哭了起来。","This was rather too violent exercise to last long.When they were all wearied out, and could tear and beat no longer, they dragged Oliver, struggling and shouting, but nothing daunted, into the dust-cellar, and there locked him up.This being done, Mrs. Sowerberry sunk into a chair, and burst into tears."
"“上帝保佑她，她又犯病了！”夏洛特说。“拿一杯水来，诺亚，亲爱的。要快！”","“Bless her, she’s going off!” said Charlotte.“A glass of water, Noah, dear.Make haste!”"
"“噢！夏洛特。”苏尔伯雷夫人挣扎着说道，她喘不过气来，并且诺亚在她头上和肩上泼了些凉水，她觉得泼得有些多了。“噢！夏洛特，我们没有在睡梦中被杀死是多么幸运啊！”","“Oh!Charlotte,” said Mrs. Sowerberry: speaking as well as she could, through a deficiency of breath, and a sufficiency of cold water, which Noah had poured over her head and shoulders.“Oh!Charlotte, what a mercy we have not all been murdered in our beds!”"
"“啊！确实很幸运，太太。”夏洛特回答道，“我只希望老板能接受教训，不要再招惹这些可怕的东西了，他们生来就是杀人犯和强盗，从在摇篮里起就是。可怜的诺亚！我进来的时候，他差点就被打死了，太太。”","“Ah! mercy indeed, ma’am,” was the reply.“I only hope this’ll teach master not to have any more of these dreadful creatures, that are born to be murderers and robbers from their very cradle.Poor Noah!He was all but killed, ma’am, when I come in.”"
"“可怜的伙计！”苏尔伯雷夫人说着，同情地看着慈善学校学生。","“Poor fellow!” said Mrs. Sowerberry: looking piteously on the charity-boy."
"诺亚背心的第一颗扣子可能已经和奥利弗的帽顶差不多在同一个高度，他受到这番怜悯同情，用手腕内侧擦了擦眼睛，抽泣着，流下了令人感动怜悯的泪水。","Noah, whose top waistcoat-button might have been somewhere on a level with the crown of Oliver’s head, rubbed his eyes with the inside of his wrists while this commiseration was bestowed upon him, and performed some affecting tears and sniffs."
"“这要怎么办？”苏尔伯雷夫人惊叫。“你们主人不在家，这屋子里连个男人都没有，用不了十分钟，他就会把那扇门踢倒啦。”奥利弗正对他们谈论的那块木板大力拳打脚踢，使这件事发生的可能性大大提高。","“What’s to be done!” exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry.“Your master’s not at home; there’s not a man in the house, and he’ll kick that door down in ten minutes.”Oliver’s vigorous plunges against the bit of timber in question, rendered this occurance highly probable."
"“天啊，天啊！我不知道，太太，”夏洛特说，“除非我们派人把警察请来。”","“Dear, dear!I don’t know, ma’am,” said Charlotte, “unless we send for the police-officers.”"
"“或是叫军队来。”克雷波尔先生建议道。","“Or the millingtary,” suggested Mr. Claypole."
"“不，不。”苏尔伯雷夫人说，她想起了奥利弗的老朋友。“快跑去邦布尔先生那儿，诺亚，告诉他马上到这里来，一分钟也别耽搁，别管你的帽子了！要快！你可以在跑的时候拿把小刀贴在那只青了的眼睛上。它会消肿的。”","“No, no,” said Mrs. Sowerberry: bethinking herself of Oliver’s old friend.“Run to Mr. Bumble, Noah, and tell him to come here directly, and not to lose a minute; never mind your cap!Make haste!You can hold a knife to that black eye, as you run along.It’ll keep the swelling down.”"
"诺亚没有回答，而是全速出发了，这让外面的路人非常吃惊，他们看见一个慈善学校的学生匆匆忙忙地飞快穿过街道，帽子都没戴，眼睛上还贴了一把折叠刀。","Noah stopped to make no reply, but started off at his fullest speed; and very much it astonished the people who were out walking, to see a charity-boy tearing through the streets pell-mell, with no cap on his head, and a clasp-knife at his eye."
"第七章 奥利弗继续抵抗","CHAPTER VII Oliver continues refractory "
"诺亚·克雷波尔用最快的速度沿着街跑，都没有停下来喘口气，一直跑到了济贫院大门口。他在这里休息了大概一分钟，准备好了一场精彩的哭诉以及一脸让人印象深刻的泪水和恐惧，然后大声敲响了大门上的小门。他对开门的老贫民露出一张悲伤可怜的脸，这位老人在情况最好的时候，也只能看到一张张悲苦的面容，但即便是他，这时也被这张苦脸惊得往后退去。","Noah Claypole ran along the streets at his swiftest pace, and paused not once for breath, until he reached the workhouse-gate.Having rested here, for a minute or so, to collect a good burst of sobs and an imposing show of tears and terror, he knocked loudly at the wicket; and presented such a rueful face to the aged pauper who opened it, that even he, who saw nothing but rueful faces about him at the best of times, started back in astonishment."
"“哎呀，这孩子怎么了？”老贫民说道。“邦布尔先生！邦布尔先生！”诺亚带着一脸极逼真的佯装出的惊恐沮丧喊道，他的声音响亮而富有煽动性，不仅钻进了恰巧就在近旁的邦布尔先生的耳朵，而且吓了他一跳，马上冲进了院子，连三角帽都没戴——这是个稀奇而引人主意的情形，这表明即使是一位教区执事，在突然而强有力的刺激下，也可能因为突然的造访而情绪失控，忘掉个人的庄重，并为之苦恼。“噢，邦布尔先生，先生！”诺亚说，“奥利弗，先生——奥利弗他——”“什么？什么？”邦布尔先生插嘴道，他金属般的眼睛里闪烁着一丝欢乐的光芒。“没逃跑吧，他没逃跑，是吧，诺亚？”“不，先生，没有。他没逃跑，先生，但他疯了。”诺亚回答，“他想要杀了我，先生，然后他又要杀夏洛特，接着是夫人。噢！那是多么可怕的痛苦啊！这有多痛，看看吧，先生！”说到这儿，诺亚弯曲扭动着，摆出各种各样像鳗鱼的姿势，从而让邦布尔先生明白奥利弗·特威斯特暴力血腥的攻击让他受了严重的内部损伤和毁坏，这使他此刻饱受最严重的折磨。诺亚看到他传达的情报完全镇住了邦布尔先生，于是用比刚才大十倍的嗓门哀叹自己可怕的伤痛，以此增加额外的效果。当他看见一位穿白背心的绅士穿过院子时，他哀号得比之前都要悲惨，因为他正确地设想到那样做对于吸引这位绅士的注意是非常有用的，并能激起这位绅士的义愤。","“Why, what’s the matter with the boy!” said the old pauper.“Mr. Bumble!“Mr. Bumble!” cried Noah, with well-affected dismay: and in tones so loud and agitated, that they not only caught the ear of Mr. Bumble himself, who happened to be hard by, but alarmed him so much that he rushed into the yard without his cocked hat,—which is a very curious and remarkable circumstance:as showing that even a beadle, acted upon a sudden and powerful impulse, may be afflicted with a momentary visitation of loss of self-possession, and forgetfulness of personal dignity.“Oh, Mr. Bumble, sir!” said Noah: “Oliver, sir,—Oliver has—” “What?What?” interposed Mr. Bumble: with a gleam of pleasure in his metallic eyes.“Not run away; he hasn’t run away, has he, Noah?”“No, sir, no.Not run away, sir, but he’s turned wicious,” replied Noah.“He tried to murder me, sir; and then he tried to murder Charlotte; and then missis.Oh! what dreadful pain it is!Such agony, please, sir!”And here, Noah writhed and twisted his body into an extensive variety of eel-like positions; thereby giving Mr. Bumble to understand that, from the violent and sanguinary onset of Oliver Twist, he had sustained severe internal injury and damage, from which he was at that moment suffering the acutest torture.When Noah saw that the intelligence he communicated perfectly paralysed Mr. Bumble, he imparted additional effect thereunto, by bewailing his dreadful wounds ten times louder than before; and when he observed a gentleman in a white waistcoat crossing the yard, he was more tragic in his lamentations than ever: rightly conceiving it highly expedient to attract the notice, and rouse the indignation, of the gentleman aforesaid."
"这位绅士的注意力马上就被吸引了，因为他还没走出三步，就生气地转过头来，质问这个小杂种在嚎叫什么，以及邦布尔先生为什么不给他点颜色，让这一串做作的叫喊变成不由自主的嚎哭？“是个免费学校的可怜孩子，先生，”邦布尔先生回答，“他差点被杀了——只差一点，先生——被小特威斯特杀了。”“天啊！”穿白背心的绅士突然停下，惊叫道，“我就知道！我从一开始就有一种奇怪的预感，那个胆大包天的小野人终会被绞死的！”“他还试图，先生，要去杀死女佣人。”邦布尔先生说着，面色灰白。","The gentleman’s notice was very soon attracted; for he had not walked three paces, when he turned angrily round, and inquired what that young cur was howling for, and why Mr. Bumble did not favour him with something which would render the series of vocular exclamations so designated, an involuntary process?“It’s s a poor boy from the free-school, sir,” replied Mr. Bumble, “who has been nearly murdered—all but murdered, sir,—by young Twist.”“By Jove!” exclaimed the gentleman in the white waistcoat, stopping short.“I knew it!I felt a strange presentiment from the very first, that that audacious young savage would come to be hung!”“He has likewise attempted, sir, to murder the female servant,” said Mr. Bumble, with a face of ashy paleness."
"“还有他的女主人。”克雷波尔先生插嘴道。","“And his missis,” interposed Mr. Claypole."
"“还有他的主人也是，我想你刚才说过，诺亚？”邦布尔先生补充道。","“And his master, too, I think you said, Noah?” added Mr. Bumble."
"“不！他不在，不然奥利弗已经把他杀了。”诺亚回答，“他说他想这么干。”","“No!He’s out, or he would have murdered him,” replied Noah.“He said he wanted to.”"
"“啊！他说他想，是吗，我的孩子？”穿白背心的绅士问道。","“Ah!Said he wanted to, did he, my boy?” inquired the gentlemen in the white waistcoat."
"“是的，先生。”诺亚回答。“拜托，先生，夫人想知道邦布尔先生是否有时间立刻过去一趟，抽他一顿——因为老板出去了。”","“Yes, sir,” replied Noah.“And please, sir, missis wants to know whether Mr. Bumble can spare time to step up there, directly, and flog him—’cause master’s out.”"
"“当然，我的孩子，当然了。”穿白背心的绅士亲切地微笑着说，并且拍拍诺亚的脑袋，尽管那比他自己的还高出三英尺。“你是个好孩子——非常好的孩子。这个便士给你。邦布尔，带上你的手杖马上去苏尔伯雷夫人那里，看看怎么做才好。别饶了他，邦布尔。”","“Certainly, my boy; certainly,” said the gentleman in the white waistcoat: smiling benignly, and patting Noah’s head, which was about three inches higher than his own.“You’re a good boy—a very good boy.Here’s a penny for you.Bumble, just step up to Sowerberry’s with your cane, and see what’s best to be done.Don’t spare him, Bumble.”"
"“不，我不会的，先生。”教区执事回答。这时候，邦布尔先生已经把三角帽和手杖整理得让自己非常满意了，他和诺亚·克雷波尔这才一起全速奔赴殡葬承办人的铺子。","“No, I will not, sir,” replied the beadle.And the cocked hat and cane having been, by this time, adjusted to their owner’s satisfaction, Mr. Bumble and Noah Claypole betook themselves with all speed to the undertaker’s shop."
"这边的情势还是完全没有改善。苏尔伯雷还没有回来，而奥利弗还在踢着地窖的门，精力丝毫不减。苏尔伯雷夫人和夏洛特将他的残暴描述成了一种极其惊人的天性，因此邦布尔先生认为出于谨慎，在开门前应该进行和谈。抱着这种想法，他从外面踢了一下门作为开场白，然后把嘴巴凑近钥匙孔，用一种低沉而令人印象深刻的语气说：“奥利弗！”","Here the position of affairs had not at all improved.Sowerberry had not yet returned, and Oliver continued to kick, with undiminished vigour, at the cellar-door.The accounts of his ferocity as related by Mrs. Sowerberry and Charlotte, were of so startling a nature, that Mr. Bumble judged it prudent to parley, before opening the door.With this view he gave a kick at the outside, by way of prelude; and, then, applying his mouth to the keyhole, said, in a deep and impressive tone: “Oliver!”"
"“喂，你们放我出去！”奥利弗从里面答道。","“Come; you let me out!” replied Oliver, from the inside."
"“你知道这个声音是谁吗，奥利弗？”邦布尔先生说。","“Do you know this here voice, Oliver?” said Mr. Bumble."
"“是的。”奥利弗回答。","“Yes,” replied Oliver."
"“你听到它不害怕吗，先生？我说话的时候你没有浑身一颤吗，先生？”邦布尔先生说。","“Ain’t you afraid of it, sir?Ain’t you a-trembling while I speak, sir?” said Mr. Bumble."
"“不！”奥利弗勇敢地回答道。","“No!” replied Oliver, boldly."
"这和他想要引出的，以及习惯收到的答案太不一样了，邦布尔先生大吃一惊。他从钥匙孔那里往后退去，完全挺直了身体，挨个看了看三位旁观者的脸，惊愕得说不出话来。","An answer so different from the one he had expected to elicit, and was in the habit of receiving, staggered Mr. Bumble not a little.He stepped back from the keyhole; drew himself up to his full height; and looked from one to another of the three bystanders, in mute astonishment."
"“噢，你知道，邦布尔先生，他肯定是疯了。”苏尔伯雷夫人说。","“Oh, you know, Mr. Bumble, he must be mad,” said Mrs. Sowerberry."
"“就算只有他一半的见识，也没有哪个孩子敢这样和您说话。”","“No boy in half his senses could venture to speak so to you.”"
"“那不是发疯，太太。”邦布尔先生深深沉思了一会儿后回答，“是肉。”","“It’s s not Madness, ma’am,” replied Mr. Bumble, after a few moments of deep meditation.“It’s s Meat.”"
"“什么？”苏尔伯雷夫人惊叫道。","“What?” exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry."
"“肉，太太，是肉。”邦布尔先生严肃地强调，“你们给他喂得太多了，太太。你们在他身上培养出了一种虚假的灵魂和精神，太太，这不适合他的身份地位，苏尔伯雷夫人，委员们都是很现实的哲学家，他们会告诉你的。贫民们要灵魂和精神干什么？我们让他们的肉体活着已经足够了。如果你一直用稀粥来喂这个孩子，太太，这件事就绝对不会发生。”","“Meat, ma’am, meat,” replied Bumble, with stern emphasis.“You’ve over-fed him, ma’am.You’ve raised a artificial soul and spirit in him, ma’am, unbecoming a person of his condition: as the board, Mrs. Sowerberry, who are practical philosophers, will tell you.What have paupers to do with soul or spirit?It’s quite enough that we let ’em have live bodies.If you had kept the boy on gruel, ma’am, this would never have happened.”"
"“天啊，天啊！”苏尔伯雷夫人突然叫道，一边虔诚地抬眼看着厨房的天花板，“一时慷慨导致了这种事情发生！”","“Dear, dear!” ejaculated Mrs. Sowerberry, piously raising her eyes to the kitchen ceiling: “this comes of being liberal!”"
"苏尔伯雷夫人对奥利弗的慷慨，就是赠予他别人都不会吃的丰盛的残羹冷炙，所以在邦布尔先生的严厉谴责下，她不由自主地显出一种非常温顺卑躬、自我奉献的样子来。公正地为她说一句，她的这种做法在思想、言辞或行为上都完全是清白的。","The liberality of Mrs. Sowerberry to Oliver, had consisted of a profuse bestowal upon him of all the dirty odds and ends which nobody else would eat; so there was a great deal of meekness and self-devotion in her voluntarily remaining under Mr. Bumble’s heavy accusation.Of which, to do her justice, she was wholly innocent, in thought, word, or deed."
"“啊！”邦布尔先生看到那位女士又垂下眼睛看向地面，说道，“现在唯一能做的事情，就我所知，是让他在这个地窖里呆上个一两天，直到他被饿得有些撑不住了再放他出来，并且在他的整个学徒期都只喂他吃稀粥。他出身卑贱。他还天生容易激动，苏尔伯雷夫人！护士和医生都说，他母亲历尽艰难困苦才来到这里，要是个好女人，肯定几个星期前就死掉了。”","“Ah!” said Mr. Bumble, when the lady brought her eyes down to earth again; “the only thing that can be done now, that I know of, is to leave him in the cellar for a day or so, till he’s a little starved down; and then to take him out, and keep him on gruel all through the apprenticeship.He comes of a bad family.Excitable natures, Mrs. Sowerberry!Both the nurse and doctor said, that that mother of his made her way here, against difficulties and pain that would have killed any well-disposed woman, weeks before.”"
"邦布尔先生讲到这儿，奥利弗已经听明白了，他妈妈又受到了同样的暗讽，他又开始踢起门来，踢得那么用力，其他所有人的声音都听不见了。苏尔伯雷在这当口儿回来了。为了能最大限度地引起他的愤怒，女人们非常夸张地解释了奥利弗的罪过。他瞬间打开地窖的门锁，揪住这个反叛学徒的领子，把他拖了出来，","At this point of Mr. Bumble’s discourse, Oliver, just hearing enough to know that some allusion was being made to his mother, recommenced kicking, with a violence that rendered every other sound inaudible.Sowerberry returned at this juncture.Oliver’s offence having been explained to him, with such exaggerations as the ladies thought best calculated to rouse his ire, he unlocked the cellar-door in a twinkling, and dragged his rebellious apprentice out, by the collar."
"奥利弗的衣服在挨打的时候已经破了，脸上满是瘀伤和抓痕，头发散落在前额上。然而，他脸上因愤怒而产生的红晕尚未退去，他刚被从牢里拉出来，就放肆地怒视着诺亚，看起来毫不气馁。","Oliver’s clothes had been torn in the beating he had received; his face was bruised and scratched; and his hair scattered over his forehead.The angry flush had not disappeared, however; and when he was pulled out of his prison, he scowled boldly on Noah, and looked quite undismayed."
"“那么，你是个好小伙子，是不是啊？”苏尔伯雷说着，晃了奥利弗一下，打了他一个耳光。","“Now, you are a nice young fellow, ain’t you?” said Sowerberry; giving Oliver a shake, and a box on the ear."
"“他骂我母亲。”奥利弗回答道。","“He called my mother names,” replied Oliver."
"“好吧，就算他骂了又怎么样，你这个忘恩负义的小坏蛋？”苏尔伯雷夫人说，“她活该被骂，还应该被骂得更狠点儿。”","“Well, and what if he did, you little ungrateful wretch?” said Mrs. Sowerberry.“She deserved what he said, and worse.”"
"“她不是那样的。”奥利弗说。","“She didn’t!” said Oliver."
"“她就是。”苏尔伯雷夫人说道。","“She did,” said Mrs. Sowerberry."
"“这是骗人的！”奥利弗说。","“It’s a lie!” said Oliver."
"苏尔伯雷夫人大哭起来，泪水汹涌而下。","Mrs. Sowerberry burst into a flood of tears."
"这阵汹涌的泪水让苏尔伯雷先生别无选择。如果他在对奥利弗进行最严厉的惩罚这件事上有哪怕只是一瞬间的迟疑，所有有经验的读者都清楚，依据所有婚姻中已有的争端先例，他会被看作是一头畜生，一个不近人情的丈夫，一个粗野无礼的人，一个男子汉的卑劣复制品，还有其他各种各样合适的名号，实在太多，受本章篇幅的限制在此不能详述。公正地说，苏尔伯雷，在他自己的权利范围之内——它并不很大——对这孩子相当有好感，可能是他兴趣使然，也可能是因为他的妻子不喜欢奥利弗。然而，这阵汹涌的泪水让他别无他法，所以他只得立刻把奥利弗痛打了一顿，这甚至令苏尔伯雷夫人本人都非常满意，并且这之后邦布尔先生也没什么必要使用他的教区手杖了。这一天接下来的时间里，奥利弗被关在后厨，与一个水泵和一片面包相伴。到了晚上，苏尔伯雷夫人先在门外东拉西扯地说了一番，那些绝不是纪念他母亲的恭维话，然后在诺亚和夏洛特的嘲笑和指指点点中看向屋里，命令他上楼到他阴暗凄凉的床铺那儿去。","This flood of tears left Mr. Sowerberry no alternative.If he had hesitated for one instant to punish Oliver most severely, it must be quite clear to every experienced reader that he would have been, according to all precedents in disputes of matrimony established, a brute, an unnatural husband, an insulting creature, a base imitation of a man, and various other agreeable characters too numerous for recital within the limits of this chapter.To do him justice, he was, as far as his power went—it was not very extensive—kindly disposed towards the boy; perhaps, because it was his interest to be so; perhaps, because his wife disliked him.The flood of tears, however, left him no resource; so he at once gave him a drubbing, which satisfied even Mrs. Sowerberry herself, and rendered Mr. Bumble’s subsequent application of the parochial cane, rather unnecessary.For the rest of the day, he was shut up in the back kitchen, in company with a pump and a slice of bread; and at night, Mrs. Sowerberry, after making various remarks outside the door, by no means complimentary to the memory of his mother, looked into the room, and, amidst the jeers and pointings of Noah and Charlotte, ordered him upstairs to his dismal bed."
"直到他独自处在殡葬承办人昏暗的工作间里，周围一片寂静无声的时候，奥利弗才释放出这一天的遭遇可能在他心中唤起的感情，他还只不过是个孩子。他一脸鄙夷地听着他们的嘲笑，他一声不吭地承受着鞭打，因为他感到心中升起一种自尊，这种自尊会让他坚持到最后一口气，哪怕他们把他活活烤死。但是现在，没有人看得见或听得到，他跪倒在地，把脸埋在手里，流下了眼泪，上帝赋予我们这种天性，却很少有人这么小就在上帝面前倾泻出泪水！","It was not until he was left alone in the silence and stillness of the gloomy workshop of the undertaker, that Oliver gave way to the feelings which the day’s treatment may be supposed likely to have awakened in a mere child.He had listened to their taunts with a look of contempt; he had borne the lash without a cry: for he felt that pride swelling in his heart which would have kept down a shriek to the last, though they had roasted him alive.But now, when there were none to see or hear him, he fell upon his knees on the floor; and, hiding his face in his hands, wept such tears as, God send for the credit of our nature, few so young may ever have cause to pour out before him!"
"很长一段时间，奥利弗都保持着这种固定的姿势。蜡烛已经越来越短，要燃到烛台了，这时他站了起来。他谨慎地扫视四周，专注地听了听，轻轻地打开门闩，往外望去。","For a long time, Oliver remained motionless in this attitude.The candle was burning low in the socket when he rose to his feet.Having gazed cautiously round him, and listened intently, he gently undid the fastenings of the door, and looked abroad."
"这个夜晚又寒冷又黑暗。星星们在这个孩子眼里，似乎比他以前看到的离大地更远，没有风，树在地上投下昏暗的影子，因为太寂静，看起来像坟墓似的死气沉沉。他轻轻关上了门。他借着快要熄灭的烛光，用一块手帕把他为数不多的几件破衣烂衫扎了起来，然后在一张凳子上坐下，等待着黎明。","It was a cold, dark night.The stars seemed, to the boy’s eyes, farther from the earth than he had ever seen them before; there was no wind; and the sombre shadows thrown by the trees upon the ground, looked sepulchral and death-like, from being so still.He softly reclosed the door.Having availed himself of the expiring light of the candle to tie up in a handkerchief the few articles of wearing apparel he had, sat himself down upon a bench, to wait for morning."
"当第一缕晨光钻过百叶窗缝隙的时候，奥利弗站了起来，又一次拔去门闩。他胆怯地四下望了望——有一瞬间的迟疑——他将身后的门关了起来，来到了大街上。","With the first ray of light that struggled through the crevices in the shutters, Oliver arose, and again unbarred the door.One timid look around—one moment’s pause of hesitation—he had closed it behind him, and was in the open street."
"他看看右边又看看左边，不确定要逃向哪里。","He looked to the right and to the left, uncertain whither to fly."
"他记得曾看到过运货的马车出门，然后吃力地爬上小山。他走了同一条路线，来到一条横穿田野的小径，他知道再走过一段距离后，它会重新通向大路，他拐进这条小径，快步走了起来。","He remembered to have seen the waggons, as they went out, toiling up the hill.He took the same route; and arriving at a footpath across the fields: which he knew, after some distance, led out again into the road; struck into it, and walked quickly on."
"奥利弗清楚地记得他曾经沿着这同一条小径，跟着邦布尔先生一路小跑，那时邦布尔先生第一次把他从寄养所带往济贫院。这条路直直通往寄养所。一想起这个，他的心就跳得很快，差点就决定往回走了。他已经走了很远了，如果那么做会耽搁很多时间。另外，天色尚早，几乎不用担心被看见，所以他继续走起来。","Along this same footpath, Oliver well-remembered he had trotted beside Mr. Bumble, when he first carried him to the workhouse from the farm.His way lay directly in front of the cottage.His heart beat quickly when he bethought himself of this; and he half resolved to turn back.He had come a long way though, and should lose a great deal of time by doing so.Besides, it was so early that there was very little fear of his being seen; so he walked on."
"他到达了寄养所。一大早，还没有被收容者忙碌活跃的迹象。奥利弗停下来，往花园里窥视。一个孩子正在给一个小苗圃除草，当他停下来时，他抬起了苍白的脸，奥利弗便看见了一张过去同伴的面容。奥利弗很高兴在走之前看到他，因为，尽管那孩子比他小一些，却曾经是他的小朋友和玩伴。他们曾经无数次地一起挨打、挨饿以及被关起来。","He reached the house.There was no appearance of its inmates stirring at that early hour.Oliver stopped, and peeped into the garden.A child was weeding one of the little beds; as he stopped, he raised his pale face and disclosed the features of one of his former companions.Oliver felt glad to see him, before he went; for, though younger than himself, he had been his little friend and playmate.They had been beaten, and starved, and shut up together, many and many a time."
"“嘘，迪克！”奥利弗说道，那孩子跑向大门，把细瘦的胳膊从栏杆间挤出来跟他打招呼。“有谁起床了吗？”","“Hush, Dick!” said Oliver, as the boy ran to the gate, and thrust his thin arm between the rails to greet him.“Is any one up?”"
"“只有我。”孩子回答。","“Nobody but me,” replied the child."
"“你不可以说你见过我，迪克。”奥利弗说，“我正在逃跑。他们打我，虐待我，迪克，我要去找出路，到很远的地方去。我也不知道去哪里。你可太苍白了！”","“You musn’t say you saw me, Dick,” said Oliver.“I am running away.They beat and ill-use me, Dick; and I am going to seek my fortune, some long way off.I don’t know where.How pale you are!”"
"“我听医生跟他们说我要死了。”孩子回答道，无力地微笑了一下，“我真高兴能看见你，亲爱的，但是不要停下，别停！”","“I heard the doctor tell them I was dying,” replied the child with a faint smile.“I am very glad to see you, dear; but don’t stop, don’t stop!”"
"“是的，是的，我会的，我只是跟你道别一下。”奥利弗回答，“我还会再见到你的，迪克。我知道我会的！你会健康又快乐的！”","“Yes, yes, I will, to say good-b’ye to you,” replied Oliver.“I shall see you again, Dick.I know I shall!You will be well and happy!”"
"“希望如此。”孩子回答道，“但那是在我死了之后，而不是之前。我知道医生肯定是对的，奥利弗，因为我总梦见天堂和天使们，还有一些我醒着的时候从没见过的和善面孔。亲亲我吧。”孩子说着，爬上矮门，用他的小胳膊一把圈住奥利弗的脖子。“再——见，亲爱的！上帝保佑你！”","“I hope so,” replied the child.“After I am dead, but not before.I know the doctor must be right, Oliver, because I dream so much of Heaven, and Angels, and kind faces that I never see when I am awake.Kiss me,” said the child, climbing up the low gate, and flinging his little arms round Oliver’s neck.“Good-b’ye, dear! God bless you!”"
"这祝福出自一个年幼的孩子之口，在奥利弗的脑海中，却是他听到的第一份给他的祝福。他之后的人生充满了挣扎和痛苦、麻烦和变数，他却一次也不曾忘记过它。","The blessing was from a young child’s lips, but it was the first that Oliver had ever heard invoked upon his head; and through the struggles and sufferings, and troubles and changes, of his after life, he never once forgot it."
"第八章 奥利弗步行去伦敦。他在路上遇到一位相当奇怪的小绅士","CHAPTER VIII Oliver walks to London. He encounters on the road a strange sort of young gentleman "
"奥利弗来到小径尽头专供人跨越栅栏的台阶，又一次到了主路上。这时候是八点钟了。尽管他已经离开小镇五英里地了，他还是一会儿跑几步，一会儿又躲在篱笆后面，如此交替着直到中午，生怕被人追上捉住。他在路边的里程碑旁坐下，头一次开始思考，他去哪里谋生比较好。他旁边那块石碑上的大字标明，这个地方距伦敦只有七十英里。这个名字在奥利弗心中唤起了一系列新想法。伦敦！——伟大的地方——没有人——即使是邦布尔先生——能在那里找到他！他还曾经多次听到济贫院的老人说，有志气的小伙子在伦敦不会缺少衣食，在那座大城市有很多种谋生的办法，那是在乡下长大的人想象不到的。对于一个无家可归、倘若没有人帮忙就肯定会死在街上的男孩来说，那是个非常合适的地方。这些想法在他脑海中闪过，他立刻从地上跳了起来，再一次向前走去。他与伦敦之间的距离已经减少了整整四英里了，然后他想起在到达目的地之前还要忍受多久这个问题。这种顾虑一降临到他头上，他就稍稍放慢了脚步，思考起去那里的办法。他的包裹里有一片硬面包，一件粗布衬衣和两双长袜。他口袋里还有一个便士——那是苏尔伯雷在某场葬礼过后因为他表现得比平时优异而赏给他的。“一件干净的衬衣，”奥利弗想，“穿着非常舒服，两双打了补丁的长袜也是，一个便士也很好，但是它们对于在冬天赶六十五英里的路程就帮不上太大忙了。”但是奥利弗的想法和其他大多数人一样，尽管他们非常愿意指出他面临的困难，并且相当积极，但是说到克服这些困难的实际可行的方式时，他们就不知所措了。所以，在进行了一番没有任何特别效果的思索后，奥利弗把小包裹从一个肩膀挪到另一个上，继续步履艰难地前进。","Oliver reached the stile at which the by-path terminated; and once more gained the high-road.It was eight o’clock now.Though he was nearly five miles away from the town, he ran, and hid behind the hedges, by turns, till noon: fearing that he might be pursued and overtaken.Then he sat down to rest by the side of the milestone, and began to think, for the first time, where he had better go and try to live.The stone by which he was seated, bore, in large characters, an intimation that it was just seventy miles from that spot to London.The name awakened a new train of ideas in the boy’s mind.London!—that great place!—nobody—not even Mr. Bumble—could ever find him there!He had often heard the old men in the workhouse, too, say that no lad of spirit need want in London; and that there were ways of living in that vast city, which those who had been bred up in country parts had no idea of.It was the very place for a homeless boy, who must die in the streets unless some one helped him.As these things passed through his thoughts, he jumped upon his feet, and again walked forward.He had diminished the distance between himself and London by full four miles more, before he recollected how much he must undergo ere he could hope to reach his place of destination.As this consideration forced itself upon him, he slackened his pace a little, and meditated upon his means of getting there.He had a crust of bread, a coarse shirt, and two pairs of stockings, in his bundle.He had a penny too—a gift of Sowerberry’s after some funeral in which he had acquitted himself more than ordinarily well—in his pocket.“A clean shirt,” thought Oliver, “is a very comfortable thing; and so are two pairs of darned stockings; and so is a penny; but they are small helps to a sixty-five miles’walk in winter time.”But Oliver’s thoughts, like those of most other people, although they were extremely ready and active to point out his difficulties, were wholly at a loss to suggest any feasible mode of surmounting them; so, after a good deal of thinking to no particular purpose, he changed his little bundle over to the other shoulder, and trudged on."
"奥利弗当天走了二十里，一整天就只吃了那片硬面包，喝了几口水，那水还是他在路边农舍门口讨来的。夜晚到来时，他走进一片草场，蹑手蹑脚地爬到一个干草堆下面，决定在那儿躺到天亮。一开始他感到害怕，因为夜风在空旷的田地上凄凉凄厉地呻吟呜咽，而他又冷又饿，并且感到比以往任何时候都要孤独。但是他走得太累了，很快就进入梦乡，忘记了烦恼。第二天早上起来的时候，他觉得自己被冻僵了。他太饿了，只好在他经过的第一个村子用一个便士换了一小块面包。夜幕再次降临时，他走了还不到十二英里。他双脚痛得厉害，两腿虚弱得直打颤。他在寒冷潮湿的野外又度过了一个夜晚，状况变得更糟了，第二天早上当他启程继续旅行的时候，几乎要爬着走了。他在一座陡峭的小山下等候，直到一辆驿站马车出现，他向呆在车厢外面的乘客乞讨，却没什么人理会他。有几个乘客让他等到他们爬上小山顶再说，让他们看看他能为了半个便士跑多远。可怜的奥利弗想试着跟上马车跑一小段，但是疲劳和酸痛的双脚却让他无法做到。那几个坐在外面的乘客看到这情景，就再一次把半个便士放回了口袋，宣布奥利弗是只懒惰的小狗，不配得到任何东西，之后马车飞奔而去，只在车后留下一片烟尘。一些村庄里挂着刷了油漆的大木板，警告所有在那片区域乞讨的人，他们将会被关进监狱。这让奥利弗非常害怕，他想用最快的速度离开那些村庄。在另一些村子，他会站在旅店庭院附近，表情悲伤地看着过往的每一个人；他就这么站着、看着，直到旅店的老板娘找了一个在附近闲逛的邮差，把这个奇怪的男孩赶跑，她确信这孩子是来偷东西的。如果他在某户农家乞讨，十有八九他们会威胁说要放狗咬他，当他刚在一家铺子探了个头的时候，就听到人们在谈论教区执事——这让奥利弗的心提到了嗓子眼里——这往往是数个小时以来唯一进到他嘴里的东西。事实上，要不是一个好心的公路收费员和一位乐善好施的老奶奶，奥利弗的苦难就会提早结束了，结束的过程和他母亲的一样，换句话说，他肯定已经死在大道上了。然而那位收费员请他吃了一顿便饭，有面包和奶酪；而那位老奶奶有个孙子遭遇了海难，赤脚流落在世上某个遥远的地方，所以很同情这可怜的孤儿，她把能给他的那点东西都给他了——不仅如此——她还对奥利弗说了很多亲切温柔的话，为他流下了怜悯和同情的泪水，这些深深沉入奥利弗灵魂深处，胜过了他经历过的所有痛苦。","Oliver walked twenty miles that day; and all that time tasted nothing but the crust of dry bread, and a few draughts of water, which he begged at the cottage-doors by the road-side.When the night came, he turned into a meadow; and, creeping close under a hay-rick, determined to lie there, till morning.He felt frightened at first, for the wind moaned dismally over the empty fields: and he was cold and hungry, and more alone than he had ever felt before.Being very tired with his walk, however, he soon fell asleep and forgot his troubles.He felt cold and stiff, when he got up next morning, and so hungry that he was obliged to exchange the penny for a small loaf, in the very first village through which he passed.He had walked no more than twelve miles, when night closed in again.His feet were sore, and his legs so weak that they trembled beneath him.Another night passed in the bleak damp air, made him worse; when he set forward on his journey next morning he could hardly crawl along.He waited at the bottom of a steep hill till a stage-coach came up, and then begged of the outside passengers; but there were very few who took any notice of him: and even those told him to wait till they got to the top of the hill, and then let them see how far he could run for a halfpenny.Poor Oliver tried to keep up with the coach a little way, but was unable to do it, by reason of his fatigue and sore feet.When the outsides saw this, they put their halfpence back into their pockets again, declaring that he was an idle young dog, and didn’t deserve anything; and the coach rattled away and left only a cloud of dust behind.In some villages, large painted boards were fixed up: warning all persons who begged within the district, that they would be sent to jail.This frightened Oliver very much, and made him glad to get out of those villages with all possible expedition.In others, he would stand about the inn-yards, and look mournfully at every one who passed: a proceeding which generally terminated in the landlady’s ordering one of the post-boys who were lounging about, to drive that strange boy out of the place, for she was sure he had come to steal something.If he begged at a farmer’s house, ten to one but they threatened to set the dog on him; and when he showed his nose in a shop, they talked about the beadle—which brought Oliver’s heart into his mouth,—very often the only thing he had there, for many hours together.In fact, if it had not been for a good-hearted turnpike-man, and a benevolent old lady, Oliver’s troubles would have been shortened by the very same process which had put an end to his mother’s; in other words, he would most assuredly have fallen dead upon the king’s highway.But the turnpike-man gave him a meal of bread and cheese; and the old lady, who had a shipwrecked grandson wandering barefoot in some distant part of the earth, took pity upon the poor orphan, and gave him what little she could afford—and more—with such kind and gentle words, and such tears of sympathy and compassion, that they sank deeper into Oliver’s soul, than all the sufferings he had ever undergone."
"在离开故乡第七天的一大早，奥利弗慢吞吞地跛着脚走进了小镇巴尼特。百叶窗都关着，街上空无一人，还没有一个人醒来做当天的事。初升的太阳放射出无尽灿烂美丽的光辉，但这霞光却只能让这个孩子看到自己有多么孤独和凄凉，他在一处门阶上坐下来，双脚流着血，满身尘土。百叶窗渐渐地打开了，窗帘也拉了上去，人们开始来来回回地经过。少数几个人停下来看了奥利弗一两下，或是匆忙走过时回过头来盯着他看，但是没有一个人救济他，或是费功夫询问他是怎么来到这儿的。他没有勇气乞讨。就坐在那里。","Early on the seventh morning after he had left his native place, Oliver limped slowly into the little town of Barnet.The window-shutters were closed; the street was empty; not a soul had awakened to the business of the day.The sun was rising in all its splendid beauty; but the light only served to show the boy his own lonesomeness and desolation, as he sat, with bleeding feet and covered with dust, upon a door-step.By degrees, the shutters were opened; the window-blinds were drawn up; and people began passing to and fro.Some few stopped to gaze at Oliver for a moment or two, or turned round to stare at him as they hurried by; but none relieved him, or troubled themselves to inquire how he came there.He had no heart to beg.And there he sat."
"他在台阶上蜷缩了一段时间，对有那么多酒店感到惊讶（巴尼特每隔一间房子就有一个或大或小的酒馆），他无精打采地看着一辆辆经过的马车，想着这真是奇怪，它们能够轻松地在几小时之内走完一段路途，而那是他带着超越自己年龄的勇气和决心花了一整个星期才完成的。就在那时，他猛地一惊，发现一个十分钟前不经意从他身旁走过的男孩，走了回来，现在正从路对面无比认真地审视着他。他起初没怎么注意这事，但是那个男孩保持着同样的姿势，仔细观察了很长时间，奥利弗抬起头来，镇定地看回去。那男孩见此，就穿过马路，走到奥利弗身旁，说道：“你好，伙计！怎么回事？”","He had been crouching on the step for some time: wondering at the great number of public-houses (every other house in Barnet was a tavern, large or small), gazing listlessly at the coaches as they passed through, and thinking how strange it seemed that they could do, with ease, in a few hours, what it had taken him a whole week of courage and determination beyond his years to accomplish: when he was roused by observing that a boy, who had passed him carelessly some minutes before, had returned, and was now surveying him most earnestly from the opposite side of the way.He took little heed of this at first; but the boy remained in the same attitude of close observation so long, that Oliver raised his head, and returned his steady look.Upon this, the boy crossed over; and walking close up to Oliver, said, “Hullo, my covey!What’s the row?”"
"向年幼的徒步旅行者发问的这个男孩和奥利弗差不多大，但却是奥利弗见过的长相最怪异的男孩。他长着一个塌鼻子，额头扁平，面相相当普通，在你能见到的少年里是最脏兮兮的了，但是他浑身上下却是一副成年人的气质和派头。他的个子在他这个年龄有点矮，他长着一副罗圈腿和一双敏锐却难看的小眼睛。他的帽子松松地戴在头上，随时都有掉下来的可能——要不是戴帽子的人有个窍门，即时不时地突然把头一摆，让帽子再次回到原位，它早就掉下来好多次了。他穿着一件大人的外套，差不多拖到了脚后跟。他把袖子往胳膊上挽了一半，才把手从袖口伸出来，最终目的显然是要把它们插进自己灯芯绒裤子的裤兜里，他也确实这么做了。他完全是个装模作样、大摇大摆的小绅士，穿着半筒皮靴，身高四英尺六英寸，或者还要再矮一点。","The boy who addressed this inquiry to the young wayfarer, was about his own age: but one of the queerest looking boys that Oliver had even seen.He was a snub-nosed, flat-browed, common-faced boy enough; and as dirty a juvenile as one would wish to see; but he had about him all the airs and manners of a man.He was short of his age: with rather bow-legs, and little, sharp, ugly eyes.His hat was stuck on the top of his head so lightly, that it threatened to fall off every moment—and would have done so, very often, if the wearer had not had a knack of every now and then giving his head a sudden twitch, which brought it back to its old place again.He wore a man’s coat, which reached nearly to his heels.He had turned the cuffs back, half-way up his arm, to get his hands out of the sleeves: apparently with the ultimate view of thrusting them into the pockets of his corduroy trousers; for there he kept them.He was, altogether, as roystering and swaggering a young gentleman as ever stood four feet six, or something less, in the bluchers."
"“你好，伙计！怎么回事？”这位古怪的小绅士对奥利弗说。","“Hullo, my covey!What’s the row?” said this strange young gentleman to Oliver."
"“我又累又饿。”奥利弗回答道，说话的时候眼泪在眼睛里直打转，“我走了很远的路。这七天我一直在走。”","“I am very hungry and tired,” replied Oliver: the tears standing in his eyes as he spoke.“I have walked a long way.I have been walking these seven days.”"
"“走了七天！”小绅士说道，“噢，我明白了。‘鸟嘴’的命令，嗯？但是，”他注意到奥利弗一脸惊讶，补充道，“我想你不知道什么是‘鸟嘴’，好伙——计。”","“Walking for sivin days!” said the young gentleman.“Oh, I see.Beak’s order, eh?But,” he added, noticing Oliver’s look of surprise, “I suppose you don’t know what a beak is, my flash com-pan-i-on.”"
"奥利弗轻声回答，说他一直听人用这个词描述鸟的嘴巴（注：英文beak原意为“鸟嘴”，在盗贼的黑话中有“地方治安官”之意）。","Oliver mildly replied, that he had always heard a bird’s mouth described by the term in question."
"“看看，太嫩了！”小绅士惊叫，“咳，‘鸟嘴’是对地方治安官的称呼，地方治安官命令你走的时候，并不是一直往前，而总是一往上走，就再也下不来了。你从没见过碾磨机？”","“My eyes, how green!” exclaimed the young gentleman.“Why, a beak’s a madg’st’rate; and when you walk by a beak’s order, it’s not straight forerd, but always agoing up, and niver a coming down agin.Was you never on the mill?”"
"“什么碾磨机？”奥利弗问道。","“What mill?” inquired Oliver."
"“什么碾磨机！哎呀，碾磨机——碾磨机就是那种只占一点地方，在石瓮里开动的东西。它总是在人们过得不好的时候兴盛，当人们过得好的时候就不行了，因为那个时侯他们找不到工人。但是，得啦，”小绅士说，“你需要食物，你会有的。我自己状况也不好，只有一先令外加半便士，但是，就现状而言，我会掏钱请客的。站起来吧。好啦！喂！开步走！”","“What mill!Why, the mill—the mill as takes up so little room that it’s ll work inside a Stone Jug; and always goes better when the wind’s low with people, than when it’s high; acos then they can’t get workmen.But come,” said the young gentleman; “you want grub, and you shall have it.I’m at low-water-mark myself—only one bob and a magpie; but, as far as it goes, I’ll fork out and stump.Up with you on your pins.There!Now then!’Morrice!”"
"小绅士帮奥利弗站起来，把他领到附近的杂货铺子，在那里他买了充足的熟火腿和一半四镑重的面包，或者照他自己的说法，就是“四便士的糠！”他掏出了一部分面包心，挖成一个洞，然后把火腿填进洞里，用这种巧妙的方法保持火腿的洁净，避免它沾上灰尘。这位小绅士把面包夹在胳膊下面，转进了一间小酒馆，把奥利弗领进了后面的一个酒吧间。这时，这位神秘的少年点了一罐啤酒上来，而奥利弗在他新朋友的邀请下，埋头痛痛快快地饱餐起来，在这个过程中，这个奇怪的男孩不时带着极大的兴趣看着他。","Assisting Oliver to rise, the young gentleman took him to an adjacent chandler’s shop, where he purchased a sufficiency of ready-dressed ham and a half-quartern loaf, or, as he himself expressed it, “a fourpenny bran!” the ham being kept clean and preserved from dust, by the ingenious expedient of making a hole in the loaf by pulling out a portion of the crumb, and stuffing it therein.Taking the bread under his arm, the young gentlman turned into a small public-house, and led the way to a tap-room in the rear of the premises.Here, a pot of beer was brought in, by direction of the mysterious youth; and Oliver, falling to, at his new friend’s bidding, made a long and hearty meal, during the progress of which the strange boy eyed him from time to time with great attention."
"“要去伦敦？”奥利弗终于吃完了，于是这位陌生的男孩问道。","“Going to London?” said the strange boy, when Oliver had at length concluded."
"“是的。”","“Yes.”"
"“有住的地方吗？”","“Got any lodgings?”"
"“没有。”","“No.”"
"“钱呢？”","“Money?”"
"“没有。”","“No.”"
"陌生男孩吹了声口哨，把两手尽量从大衣袖子里伸出来，插进兜里。","The strange boy whistled; and put his arms into his pockets, as far as the big coat-sleeves would let them go."
"“你住在伦敦吗？”奥利弗问。","“Do you live in London?” inquired Oliver."
"“是的。我不出远门的时候住在伦敦。”男孩回答，“我想你今晚需要找个睡觉的地方，是吗？”","“Yes.I do, when I’m at home,” replied the boy.“I suppose you want some place to sleep in to-night, don’t you?”"
"“确实是。”奥利弗回答，“我离开家乡后就没在像样的地方睡过觉。”","“I do, indeed,” answered Oliver.“I have not slept under a roof since I left the country.”"
"“别为了那点事揉眼睛了。”小绅士说，“我今晚要到伦敦去，并且我认识一个受人尊敬的老绅士，他就住在那里，会毫不犹豫地给你提供住处，一分钱也不要——只要他认识的任何一位绅士介绍了你。他认识我吗？噢，不！根本不认识！绝对不。当然不是啦！”","“Don’t fret your eyelids on that score,” said the young gentleman.“I’ve got to be in London to-night; and I know a ’spectable old gentleman as lives there, wot’s ll give you lodgings for nothink, and never ask for the change—that is, if any genelman he knows interduces you.And don’t he know me?Oh, no!Not in the least!By no means.Certainly not!”"
"小绅士一边微笑着，像是在暗示最后那几句话是开玩笑的反语，一边喝完了啤酒。","The young gentleman smiled, as if to intimate that the latter fragments of discourse were playfully ironical; and finished the beer as he did so."
"这个出人意料的提供住所的建议太诱人了，实在令人无法拒绝，尤其是紧接着又有那位老绅士提出保证，肯定会毫不犹豫地为奥利弗提供一个舒适的地方。这引起了一场更加友好私密的谈话，奥利弗从中知道他的朋友名叫杰克·道金斯，之前提到的那位老绅士是他的保护人，并且特别宠爱他。","This unexpected offer of shelter was too tempting to be resisted; especially as it was immediately followed up, by the assurance that the old gentleman referred to, would doubtless provide Oliver with a comfortable place, without loss of time.This led to a more friendly and confidential dialogue; from which Oliver discovered that his friend’s name was Jack Dawkins, and that he was a peculiar pet and protege of the elderly gentleman before mentioned."
"道金斯先生的外表，并不太能说明他的保护人提供给那些受他庇佑的人多少好处，但是，由于他的谈话方式相当反复无常、放荡不羁，并且他进一步声明他在亲密的朋友中有个更出名的绰号，叫“狡猾多端的机灵鬼”，奥利弗得出结论，他行为放荡，举止随便，早就把恩人的道德训诫抛到脑后了。在这种印象的支配下，他暗自下决心要尽快地培养出对那位老绅士的好感；他很怀疑机灵鬼积习难改、无可救药，如果他发现确实是这样，他就不再与他来往。","Mr. Dawkin’s appearance did not say a vast deal in favour of the comforts which his patron’s interest obtained for those whom he took under his protection; but, as he had a rather flightly and dissolute mode of conversing, and furthermore avowed that among his intimate friends he was better known by the sobriquet of “The Artful Dodger,” Oliver concluded that, being of a dissipated and careless turn, the moral precepts of his benefactor had hitherto been thrown away upon him.Under this impression, he secretly resolved to cultivate the good opinion of the old gentleman as quickly as possible; and, if he found the Dodger incorrigible, as he more than half suspected he should, to decline the honour of his farther acquaintance."
"因为约翰·道金斯反对他们天黑之前进入伦敦，他们到达伊斯灵顿的收税关卡时已经快十一点钟了。他们经过天使酒馆来到圣约翰大道，快步走过一条通往萨德勒之井剧院的小街，穿过埃克斯茅斯大街和矮林路，走进济贫院旁边的小巷，穿过曾经叫“困境中的霍克利”的古迹，从那里进入小红花山，再进入大红花山，机灵鬼快步疾行，吩咐奥利弗紧随其后。","As John Dawkins objected to their entering London before nightfall, it was nearly eleven o’clock when they reached the turnpike at Islington.They crossed from the Angel into St. John’s Road; struck down the small street which terminates at Sadler’s Wells Theatre; through Exmouth Street and Coppice Row; down the little court by the side of the workhouse; across the classic ground which once bore the name of Hockley-in-the-Hole; thence into Little Saffron Hill; and so into Saffron Hill the Great: along which the Dodger scudded at a rapid pace, directing Oliver to follow close at his heels."
"尽管奥利弗非常专心地紧盯自己的领路人，他在经过这些街道时，还是忍不住朝道路两旁匆匆瞥了几眼。他从没见过比这更肮脏更悲惨的地方。街道狭窄泥泞，空气中充满了污浊的臭气。","Although Oliver had enough to occupy his attention in keeping sight of his leader, he could not help bestowing a few hasty glances on either side of the way, as he passed along.A dirtier or more wretched place he had never seen.The street was very narrow and muddy, and the air was impregnated with filthy odours."
"小店倒是相当多，但是唯一的存货似乎只是一堆孩子，他们即使在那么晚的时候，还在门口爬进爬出，或是在屋里哭叫。在这地方的一片破败之中，唯一看着兴隆点的就是那些酒馆了，最下层的爱尔兰人正在那里拼命吵闹。黑漆漆的过道和院子从主路各处岔开，露出几栋房子，喝醉了的男女无疑在那里的污泥中打滚，在好几户门口，一些面貌凶恶的家伙正小心翼翼地走出来，显然不是去干什么出于好意或是无伤大雅的差事。","There were a good many small shops; but the only stock in trade appeared to be heaps of children, who, even at that time of night, were crawling in and out at the doors, or screaming from the inside.The sole places that seemed to prosper amid the general blight of the place, were the public-houses; and in them, the lowest orders of Irish were wrangling with might and main.Covered ways and yards, which here and there diverged from the main street, disclosed little knots of houses, where drunken men and women were positively wallowing in filth; and from several of the door-ways, great ill-looking fellows were cautiously emerging, bound, to all appearance, on no very well-disposed or harmless errands."
"奥利弗正在想是不是逃走会比较好，他们就来到了小山下。他的向导抓住他的胳膊，推开了菲尔德小巷附近一所房子的房门，把奥利弗拉进了走廊，并关上了身后的门。","Oliver was just considering whether he hadn’t better run away, when they reached the bottom of the hill.His conductor, catching him by the arm, pushed open the door of a house near Field Lane; and drawing him into the passage, closed it behind them."
"“行了，喂！”一个声音在下面喊道，回应了机灵鬼的一声口哨。","“Now, then!” cried a voice from below, in reply to a whistle from the Dodger."
"“李子和满贯！”机灵鬼这么答道。","“Plummy and slam!” was the reply."
"这似乎是某种表示一切正常的口令或暗号，一支蜡烛的微光在走廊尽头的墙上远远地闪现出来，一个男人的面孔从旧厨房楼梯栏杆的一处缺口露了出来。","This seemed to be some watchword or signal that all was right; for the light of a feeble candle gleamed on the wall at the remote end of the passage; and a man’s face peeped out, from where a balustrade of the old kitchen staircase had been broken away."
"“你们有两个人。”男人说着，把蜡烛拿远了些，用一只手护着眼睛。“另一个是谁？”","“There’s two on you,” said the man, thrusting the candle farther out, and shielding his eyes with his hand.“Who’s the t’other one?”"
"“一个新同伴。”杰克·道金斯回答，把奥利弗推上前来。","“A new pal,” replied Jack Dawkins, pulling Oliver forward."
"“他从哪儿来？”","“Where did he come from?”"
"“生地方。费金在楼上吗？”","“Greenland.Is Fagin upstairs?”"
"“是的，他在整理手帕呢。一起上去吧！”蜡烛收了回去，那张脸消失了。","“Yes, he’s a sortin’the wipes.Up with you!”The candle was drawn back, and the face disappeared."
"奥利弗一手摸索着路，另一只手被他的同伴紧紧抓住，非常困难地登上了黑暗破旧的楼梯，他的向导轻松迅捷地就爬了上去，显然对此地十分熟悉。","Oliver, groping his way with one hand, and having the other firmly grasped by his companion, ascended with much difficulty the dark and broken stairs: which his conductor mounted with an ease and expedition that showed he was well acquainted with them."
"他猛地打开一间里屋的房门，把奥利弗拉了进去。","He threw open the door of a back-room, and drew Oliver in after him."
"这个房间的墙壁和天花板因为岁月的洗礼和灰尘的覆盖，已经完全变黑了。壁炉前有一张松木桌子，桌上放着一支蜡烛，插在一个姜汁啤酒瓶里，还有两三个白蜡罐子，一块黄油面包和一个盘子。炉火上有个煎锅，被一根绳子固定在壁炉架上，锅里正煮着几根香肠，一个干瘪枯瘦的犹太老头正站在旁边，手里拿着烤叉，一大堆乱糟糟的红头发遮住了他那张看起来非常邪恶且可憎的脸。他穿着油腻腻的法兰绒长袍，脖子露在外面，他一边顾着煎锅，一边又留心着晾衣架，那上面挂着很多丝织手帕。几张由旧麻袋铺成的粗糙的床，一张挨一张地乱堆在地板上。四五个男孩围坐在桌边，都比机灵鬼小，却吸着长长的陶制烟斗，喝着烈酒，一副中年人的样子。这些孩子都挤在机灵鬼周围，听他们这位同伴低声对犹太佬说了几句话，然后全都转过头来对着奥利弗咧嘴笑。犹太佬手里拿着烤叉，自己也笑了起来。","The walls and ceiling of the room were perfectly black with age and dirt.There was a deal table before the fire: upon which were a candle, stuck in a ginger-beer bottle, two or three pewter pots, a loaf and butter, and a plate.In a frying-pan, which was on the fire, and which was secured to the mantelshelf by a string, some sausages were cooking; and standing over them, with a toasting-fork in his hand, was a very old shrivelled Jew, whose villainous-looking and repulsive face was obscured by a quantity of matted red hair.He was dressed in a greasy flannel gown, with his throat bare; and seemed to be dividing his attention between the frying-pan and the clothes-horse, over which a great number of silk handkerchiefs were hanging.Several rough beds made of old sacks, were huddled side by side on the floor.Seated round the table were four or five boys, none older than the Dodger, smoking long clay pipes, and drinking spirits with the air of middle-aged men.These all crowded about their associate as he whispered a few words to the Jew; and then turned round and grinned at Oliver.So did the Jew himself, toasting-fork in hand."
"“就是他，费金，”杰克·道金斯说道，“我的朋友奥利弗·特威斯特。”","“This is him, Fagin,” said Jack Dawkins;”my friend Oliver Twist.”"
"犹太佬咧嘴笑了起来，向奥利弗深深鞠了一躬，握住他的手，说希望能有幸成为他的挚友。接着，抽着烟斗的年轻绅士们来到他身边，非常用力地握着他的两只手摇了摇——尤其是他拿着小包裹的那一只。一位小绅士非常热心地帮他把帽子挂了起来，另一位特别殷勤地把双手放进了他的口袋，因为奥利弗已经很累了，这样一来他睡觉的时候就不用再劳烦自己去掏空口袋了。要不是犹太佬的烤叉非常慷慨地落到了这些热心年轻人的头上和肩膀上，这番殷勤可能还要进一步地献下去。","The Jew grinned; and, making a low obeisance to Oliver, took him by the hand, and hoped he should have the honour of his intimate acquaintance.Upon this, the young gentleman with the pipes came round him, and shook both his hands very hard—especially the one in which he held his little bundle.One young gentleman was very anxious to hang up his cap for him; and another was so obliging as to put his hands in his pockets, in order that, as he was very tired, he might not have the trouble of emptying them, himself, when he went to bed.These civilities would probably be extended much farther, but for a liberal exercise of the Jew’s toasting-fork on the heads and shoulders of the affectionate youths who offered them."
"“我们很高兴见到你，奥利弗，非常高兴。”犹太佬说，“机灵鬼，把香肠拿走，拖一个桶到炉火边给奥利弗坐。啊，你在盯着这些口袋手帕看！嗯，亲爱的。有好多手帕，对不对？我们正在选一选，准备清洗，就这样，奥利弗，就是这样。哈哈哈！”","“We are very glad to see you, Oliver, very,” said the Jew.“Dodger, take off the sausages; and draw a tub near the fire for Oliver.Ah, you’re a-staring at the pocket-handkerchiefs! eh, my dear.There are a good many of ’em, ain’t there?We’ve  just looked ’em out, ready for the wash; that’s all, Oliver; that’s all.Ha! ha! ha!”"
"这番话的后半部分，引来了一阵欢呼，这位快乐老绅士的所有得意门生都在热烈地喊叫。在这欢呼中，他们开始吃晚饭。","The latter part of this speech, was hailed by a boisterous shout from all the hopeful pupils of the merry old gentleman.In the midst of which they went to supper."
"奥利弗吃掉了他的那一份，然后犹太佬为他调了一杯热的掺水杜松子酒，告诉他必须立刻把它喝下，因为另一位绅士等着要用玻璃杯。奥利弗按要求做了。不一会儿他感到自己被轻轻放到了一个麻袋上，接着就陷入了沉睡。","Oliver ate his share, and the Jew then mixed him a glass of hot gin-and-water: telling him he must drink it off directly, because another gentleman wanted the tumbler.Oliver did as he was desired.Immediately afterwards he felt himself gently lifted on to one of the sacks; and then he sunk into a deep sleep."
"第九章 包含更多有关亲切老绅士及其得意门生的细节","CHAPTER IX Containing further particulars concerning the pleasant old gentleman, and his hopeful pupils "
"那晚奥利弗睡得很香很沉，第二天上午醒来的时候已经很晚了。房间里除了犹太老头没有其他人，而他正在一个炖锅里煮着早餐的咖啡，一边用一把铁勺子在锅里搅来搅去，一边对自己轻轻吹着口哨。楼下一有丝毫动静，他就停下听一听，当他满意了，就会继续吹着口哨，像刚才那样再次搅拌起来。尽管奥利弗从睡梦中醒了过来，却还没有完全清醒。他在半梦半醒间处于一种昏昏欲睡的状态，这时眼睛半张，对周围发生的所有事情意识模糊，梦到的东西却比紧闭双眼、完全无意识地熟睡五晚梦到的都要多。在这时，人对自己的心理活动十分清楚，足以对它的强大力量形成某些隐约的意识，它一旦不受肉体的束缚，就能脱离尘世，突破时间和空间的限制。奥利弗正是处在这种状况之下。他从半睁的双眼里看着犹太佬，听着他低低的口哨声，辨识着勺子碰到煎锅边缘的声音，同时，完全相同的意识还在心理上忙着与他认识的几乎所有人产生关联。咖啡煮好后，犹太佬把煎锅移到了铁架上。他站在那里踌躇了几分钟，似乎不太清楚自己要干什么，接着他转过身来看着奥利弗，叫他的名字。奥利弗没有回答，看着像是还在熟睡。犹太佬心里踏实了，轻轻走到门边，把门闩上。接着，在奥利弗看来，他似乎从地板上的某个暗格里抽出了一个小盒子，然后把它仔细地放在桌上。他掀开盖子往里看去，眼睛都亮了。他把一张旧椅子拖到桌前坐了下来，从盒子里面拿出了一只华丽的金表，上面的珠宝闪闪发光。“啊哈！”犹太佬说着，耸了耸肩，咧出一个极其难看的笑容，整张脸都扭曲了。“聪明的狗崽子们！聪明的狗崽子们！坚持到了最后！没告诉老牧师它们在哪儿。没供出老费金！再说他们为什么要供出来呢？那样既解不开绞索，也不能让绞刑架晚一分钟落下来。不，不，不！好家伙们！好家伙们！”犹太佬说着这些，又喃喃低语着其他类似的话，再一次把表放回那安全之处。他又从同一个盒子里挨个拿出了至少半打东西，带着同样的乐趣审视着它们，除了戒指、胸针、手镯，还有其他几样材质精美、做工考究的珠宝，奥利弗甚至叫不出它们的名字。犹太佬把这些小饰品收了起来，拿出了另一样东西，这个东西非常小，可以被他放在手掌心里。那上面似乎有一些极小的题字，因为犹太佬把它平放在桌子上，用手遮住光，认真地钻研了很长时间。最终他把它放下，似乎不抱成功的希望了，并且往椅子上一靠，低声抱怨道：“死刑可真是件好事啊！死人永远不会忏悔，死人也永远不会揭发尴尬的内情。啊，它对这买卖可是件好事啊！他们五个一个接一个地被绞死了，没有一个活下来耍花招，或是变成懦夫！”犹太佬说着这些话的时候，黑亮的眼睛先是茫然地看着前面，接着视线落到了奥利弗的脸上，孩子正无声地用眼睛盯着自己，充满了好奇，尽管认识到这一点只是在一瞬间——或许是能想到的最短的一瞬间——却足以使老头明白奥利弗在观察他。他啪地一声关上盒盖，把手放在了桌上一把面包刀上，狂暴地跳了起来。他颤抖得很厉害，因为，尽管奥利弗吓得要命，还是能看到那刀子在空中颤抖。“这是怎么回事？”犹太佬问，“你为什么监视我？你为什么醒着？你都看到什么了？说出来，小子！快——快说！不然要你的小命！”","It was late next morning when Oliver awoke, from a sound, long sleep.There was no other person in the room but the old Jew, who was boiling some coffee in a saucepan for breakfast, and whistling softly to himself as he stirred it round and round, with an iron spoon.He would stop every now and then to listen when there was the least noise below: and when he had satistified himself, he would go on whistling and stirring again, as before.Although Oliver had roused himself from sleep, he was not thoroughly awake.There is a drowsy state, between sleeping and waking, when you dream more in five minutes with your eyes half open, and yourself half conscious of everything that is passing around you, than you would in five nights with your eyes fast closed, and your senses wrapt in perfect unconsciousness.At such time, a mortal knows just enough of what his mind is doing, to form some glimmering conception of its mighty powers, its bounding from earth and spurning time and space, when freed from the restraint of its corporeal associate.Oliver was precisely in this condition.He saw the Jew with his half-closed eyes; heard his low whistling; and recognised the sound of the spoon grating against the saucepan’s sides: and yet the self-same senses were mentally engaged, at the same time, in busy action with almost everybody he had ever known.When the coffee was done, the Jew drew the saucepan to the hob.Standing, then in an irresolute attitude for a few minutes, as if he did not well know how to employ himself, he turned round and looked at Oliver, and called him by his name.He did not answer, and was to all appearances asleep.After satisfying himself upon this head, the Jew stepped gently to the door: which he fastened.He then drew forth: as it seemed to Oliver, from some trap in the floor: a small box, which he placed carefully on the table.His eyes glistened as he raised the lid, and looked in.Dragging an old chair to the table, he sat down; and took from it a magnificent gold watch, sparkling with jewels.“Aha!” said the Jew, shrugging up his shoulders, and distorting every feature with a hideous grin.“Clever dogs!Clever dogs!Staunch to the last!Never told the old parson where they were.Never poached upon old Fagin!And why should they?It wouldn’t have loosened the knot, or kept the drop up, a minute longer.No, no, no!Fine fellows!Fine fellows!”With these, and other muttered reflections of the like nature, the Jew once more deposited the watch in its place of safety.At least half a dozen more were severally drawn forth from the same box, and surveyed with equal pleasure; besides rings, brooches, bracelets, and other articles of jewellery, of such magnificent materials, and costly workmanship, that Oliver had no idea, even of their names.Having replaced these trinkets, the Jew took out another: so small that it lay in the palm of his hand.There seemed to be some very minute inscription on it; for the Jew laid it flat upon the table, and shading it with his hand, pored over it, long and earnestly.At length he put it down, as if despairing of success; and, leaning back in his chair, muttered: “What a fine thing capital punishment is!Dead men never repent; dead men never bring awkward stories to light.Ah, it’s a fine thing for the trade!Five of ’em strung up in a row, and none left to play booty, or turn white-livered!”As the Jew uttered these words, his bright dark eyes, which had been staring vacantly before him, fell on Oliver’s face; the boy’s eyes were fixed on his in mute curiousity; and although the recognition was only for an instant—for the briefest space of time that can possibly be conceived—it was enough to show the old man that he had been observed.He closed the lid of the box with a loud crash; and, laying his hand on a bread knife which was on the table, started furiously up.He trembled very much though; for, even in his terror, Oliver could see that the knife quivered in the air.“What’s that?” said the Jew.“What do you watch me for?Why are you awake?What have you seen?Speak out, boy!Quick—quick! for your life.”"
"“我再也睡不着了，先生。”奥利弗温顺地回答，“如果打扰了您，我很抱歉，先生。”","“I wasn’t able to sleep any longer, sir,” replied Oliver, meekly.“I am very sorry if I have disturbed you, sir.”"
"“一小时前你没醒？”犹太佬说着，凶巴巴地对孩子沉下了脸。","“You were not awake an hour ago?” said the Jew, scowling fiercely on the boy."
"“没有！没有，真的！”奥利弗回答道。","“No!No, indeed!” replied Oliver."
"“你确定？”犹太佬叫道，样子比刚才还要凶，一副恐吓的姿态。","“Are you sure?” cried the Jew: with a still fiercer look than before: and a threatening attitude."
"“我的确没有，先生。”奥利弗认真地回答，“我没有，真的，先生。”","“Upon my word I was not, sir,” replied Oliver, earnestly.“I was not, indeed, sir.”"
"“啐，啐，亲爱的！”犹太佬突然变回老样子，把玩了一会儿刀子，才把它放下来，好像要使人相信他把它拿起来只不过是玩玩而已。“我当然知道是那样，亲爱的。我只是想吓唬吓唬你。你是个勇敢的孩子。哈！哈！你是个勇敢的孩子，奥利弗。”犹太佬搓着手，吃吃地笑着，尽管如此，他还是不自在地瞥了盒子一眼。","“Tush, tush, my dear!” said the Jew, abruptly resuming his old manner, and playing with the knife a little, before he laid it down; as if to induce the belief that he had caught it up, in mere sport.“Of course I know that, my dear.I only tried to frighten you.You’re a brave boy.Ha! ha! you're a brave boy, Oliver.”The Jew rubbed his hands with a chuckle, but glanced uneasily at the box, notwithstanding."
"“你看到这些漂亮的东西了吗，亲爱的？”犹太佬说着，停顿了一下，把手放在盒子上。","“Did you see any of these pretty things, my dear?” said the Jew, laying his hand upon it after a short pause."
"“是的，先生。”奥利弗回答。","“Yes, sir,” replied Oliver."
"“啊！”犹太佬说道，一下子变得十分苍白。“它们——它们是我的，奥利弗，我的那一点儿财产。是我晚年的生活依靠。人们都叫我守财奴，亲爱的。只是个守财奴，就这样。”","“Ah!” said the Jew, turning rather pale.“They—they’re mine, Oliver; my little property.All I have to live upon, in my old age.The folks call me a miser, my dear.Only a miser; that’s all.”"
"奥利弗觉得这位老绅士肯定是个坚定的守财奴，才能带着那么多金表住在一个这么脏的地方。但是，一想到老头对机灵鬼和其他孩子的喜爱可能花了他不少钱，奥利弗只是恭敬地看着犹太佬，问他自己是否可以起来了。","Oliver thought the old gentleman must be a decided miser to live in such a dirty place, with so many watches; but, thinking that perhaps his fondness for the Dodger and the other boys, cost him a good deal of money, he only cast a deferential look at the Jew, and asked if he might get up."
"“当然，亲爱的，当然了。”老绅士回答，“等着。门边的角落里有一罐水。把它带过来，我给你一个盆子洗脸，亲爱的。”","“Certainly, my dear, certainly,” replied the old gentleman.“Stay.There’s a pitcher of water in the corner by the door.Bring it here; and I’ll give you a basin to wash in, my dear.”"
"奥利弗站起来，穿过房间，弯了一下腰，把罐子拿了起来。当他回过头来，盒子不见了。","Oliver got up; walked across the room; and stooped for an instant to raise the pitcher.When he turned his head, the box was gone."
"他刚刚洗完脸，按照犹太佬的指示把盆里的水倒到窗外，把一切弄整洁，机灵鬼就回来了，跟他一起回来的是个十分活泼的小伙伴，奥利弗昨天晚上看到过他抽烟，现在经过正式介绍，知道他叫查利·贝茨。四个人坐下吃早饭，有咖啡，还有一些热面包卷和火腿，它们是机灵鬼装在帽子顶里带回来的。","He had scarcely washed himself, and made everything tidy, by emptying the basin out of the window, agreeably to the Jew’s directions, when the Dodger returned: accompanied by a very sprightly young friend, whom Oliver had seen smoking on the previous night, and who was now formally introduced to him as Charley Bates.The four sat down, to breakfast, on the coffee, and some hot rolls and ham which the Dodger had brought home in the crown of his hat."
"“咳，”犹太佬奸诈地看着奥利弗，对机灵鬼说道，“我想你们早上都干活了吧，亲爱的？”","“Well,” said the Jew, glancing slyly at Oliver, and addressing himself to the Dodger, “I hope you’ve  been at work this morning, my dears?”"
"“很努力。”机灵鬼回答。","“Hard,” replied the Dodger."
"“完全豁出去了。”查利·贝茨补充道。","“As nails,” added Charley Bates."
"“好孩子们，好孩子们！”犹太人说，“你有什么收获，机灵鬼？”","“Good boys, good boys!” said the Jew.“What have you got, Dodger?”"
"“两个皮夹。”小绅士答道。","“A couple of pocket-books,” replied that young gentlman."
"“有好东西吗？”犹太佬热切地问。","“Lined?” inquired the Jew, with eagerness."
"“相当好。”机灵鬼回答，掏出两个皮夹，一个是绿的，另一个是红的。","“Pretty well,” replied the Dodger, producing two pocket-books; one green, and the other red."
"“不该这么轻。”犹太佬仔细看了里面的东西后说道，“但是样子很好，做工精致。他是个聪明的伙计，是不是，奥利弗？”","“Not so heavy as they might be,” said the Jew, after looking at the insides carefully; “but very neat and nicely made.Ingenious workman, ain’t he, Oliver?”"
"“确实是，先生。”奥利弗说。查尔斯·贝茨先生听到这话大声笑了起来，让奥利弗非常诧异，因为他看不出刚才发生的事情里有什么好笑的。","“Very indeed, sir,” said Oliver.At which Mr. Charley Bates laughed uproariously; very much to the amazement of Oliver, who saw nothing to laugh at, in anything that had passed."
"“那么你得了什么东西，亲爱的？”费金对查利·贝茨说。","“And what have you got, my dear?” said Fagin to Charley Bates."
"“手帕。”贝茨少爷一边回答一边掏出四条口袋手帕。","“Wipes,” replied Master Bates; at the same time producing four pocket-handkerchiefs."
"“嗯，”犹太佬说着，仔细地检查，“是好东西，非常好。但是你没做好记号，查利，所以记号得用针挑掉，我们会教奥利弗该怎么做。是不是，奥利弗，嗯？哈！哈！哈！”","“Well,” said the Jew, inspecting them closely; “they’re very good ones, very.You haven’t marked them well, though, Charley; so the marks shall be picked out with a needle, and we’ll teach Oliver how to do it.Shall us, Oliver, eh?Ha! ha! ha!”"
"“如果您愿意，先生。”奥利弗说道。","“If you please, sir,” said Oliver."
"“你想像查利·贝茨那样轻轻松松就做出手帕，是不是，亲爱的？”犹太佬说。","“You’d like to be able to make pocket-handkerchiefs as easy as Charley Bates, wouldn’t you, my dear?” said the Jew."
"“非常想，真的，如果你要教我的话，先生。”奥利弗回答。","“Very much, indeed, if you’ll teach me, sir,” replied Oliver."
"在贝茨少爷看来这个回答里有某些绝妙的可笑之处，他又爆发出一阵大笑，这次大笑让他喝着的咖啡走岔了道，险些让他提早窒息。","Master Bates saw something so exquisitely ludicrous in this reply, that he burst into another laugh; which laugh, meeting the coffee he was drinking, and carrying it down some wrong channel, very nearly terminated in his premature suffocation."
"“他实在嫩得可笑！”查利恢复过来后说道，以此为他的失礼行为向各位伙伴道歉。","“He is so jolly green!” said Charley when he recovered, as an apology to the company for his unpolite behaviour."
"机灵鬼没说话，但是他把奥利弗眼睛前面的额发抚平，说他渐渐地会懂得更多，这时老绅士发现奥利弗的脸红了，就换了个话题，问早上看行刑的人是不是很多？这让奥利弗越来越纳闷了，因为从两个男孩的回答来看，很明显他们两个当时都在场，奥利弗自然想知道他们怎么能有那么多时间如此勤劳敬业。","The Dodger said nothing, but he smoothed Oliver’s hair over his eyes, and said he’d know better, by and by; upon which the old gentleman, observing Oliver’s colour mounting, changed the subject by asking whether there had been much of a crowd at the execution that morning?This made him wonder more and more; for it was plain from the replies of the two boys that they had both been there; and Oliver naturally wondered how they could possibly have found time to be so very industrious."
"吃过早餐后，快活的老绅士和那两个男孩玩起了一个非常古怪罕见的游戏，玩法是这样的。快活的老绅士把一个鼻烟盒放进一侧的裤兜，把一个钱包放进另一侧，又把一块表放进背心口袋，表链挂在脖子上，又在衬衣上别了一个仿真的钻石别针。他把外套扣子扣得紧紧的，把眼镜盒和手帕放进口袋里，拿着手杖在房间里来回踱步，模仿着老绅士们一天到晚在街上漫步时的派头。他一会儿在壁炉旁边稍作停顿，一会儿在门口停下，让人相信他正全神贯注地盯着铺子的橱窗看。在这种时候，为了防贼，他会时常环顾四周，还会轮流拍拍所有的口袋，确认自己没有丢东西，看到这滑稽又自然的样子，奥利弗笑得眼泪都顺着脸颊留下来了。这段时间里，两个男孩都紧跟在他身旁，每次他转身的时候，他们都非常机敏地避开他的视线，让他无法注意到他们的行踪。最后，机灵鬼踩了他一脚，或者说是意外踩到了他的靴子，于此同时，查利·贝茨在他身后绊倒了，撞在他身上，就在那一瞬间，他们从他身上无比迅速地拿走了鼻烟盒、钱包、表带、链子、别针、手帕，甚至是眼镜盒。如果老绅士感觉到任何一个口袋里有手伸进来的话，他就叫出那手在哪儿，那么这个游戏就从头再来。","When the breakfast was cleared away; the merry old gentlman and the two boys played at a very curious and uncommon game, which was performed in this way.The merry old gentleman, placing a snuff-box in one pocket of his trousers, a note-case in the other, and a watch in his waistcoat pocket, with a guard-chain round his neck, and sticking a mock diamond pin in his shirt:buttoned his coat tight round him, and putting his spectacle-case and handkerchief in his pockets, trotted up and down the room with a stick, in imitation of the manner in which old gentlemen walk about the streets any hour in the day.Sometimes he stopped at the fire-place, and sometimes at the door, making believe that he was staring with all his might into shop-windows.At such times, he would look constantly round him, for fear of thieves, and would keep slapping all his pockets in turn, to see that he hadn’t lost anything, in such a very funny and natural manner, that Oliver laughed till the tears ran down his face.All this time, the two boys followed him closely about: getting out of his sight, so nimbly, every time he turned round, that it was impossible to follow their motions.At last, the Dodger trod upon his toes, or ran upon his boot accidently, while Charley Bates stumbled up against him behind; and in that one moment they took from him, with the most extraordinary rapidity, snuff-box, note-case, watch-guard, chain, shirt-pin, pocket-handkerchief, even the spectacle-case.If the old gentlman felt a hand in any one of his pockets, he cried out where it was; and then the game began all over again."
"这游戏玩了好多遍以后，两个小姑娘来拜访小绅士们，她们一个叫贝特，另一个叫南希。她们都长着一头浓密的头发，凌乱地挽在脑后，鞋子和长袜也相当不整洁。她们可能并不特别漂亮，但是脸上气色很好，看起来相当丰满结实、精神饱满。她们举止大方可亲，奥利弗觉得她们确实是很好的姑娘。毫无疑问她们确实是。","When this game had been played a great many times, a couple of young ladies called to see the young gentleman; one of whom was named Bet, and the other Nancy.They wore a good deal of hair, not very neatly turned up behind, and were rather untidy about the shoes and stockings.They were not exactly pretty, perhaps; but they had a great deal of colour in their faces, and looked quite stout and hearty.Being remarkably free and agreeable in their manners, Oliver thought them very nice girls indeed.As there is no doubt they were."
"访客们待了很长时间。一个小姑娘抱怨说她身体里面冷得很，于是酒被端了出来，交谈从而变得非常愉快，很有教益。最终，查利·贝茨表达了他的主张，认为该去遛一下蹄子了。在奥利弗看来，这肯定是法语“出去走走”的意思，因为接下来，机灵鬼与查利马上和两位年轻的女士一起走了，亲切的犹太老头还好心地给了他们零花钱。","The visitors stopped a long time.Spirits were produced, in consequence of one of the young ladies complaining of a coldness in her inside; and the conversation took a very convivial and improving turn.At length, Charley Bates expressed his opinion that it was time to pad the hoof.This, it occurred to Oliver, must be French for going out; for directly afterwards, the Dodger, and Charley, and the two young ladies, went away together, having been kindly furnished by the amiable old Jew with money to spend."
"“你瞧，亲爱的，”费金说。“这日子很不错，是不是？他们要出去一天呢。”","“There, my dear,” said Fagin.“That’s a pleasant life, isn’t it?They have gone out for the day.”"
"“他们已经干完活了吗，先生？”奥利弗问。","“Have they done work, sir?” inquired Oliver."
"“是的，”犹太佬说，“是那样，除非他们在外面出乎意料地遇上了活计，而且他们碰上了就不会放过，亲爱的，学着点。把他们当成你的榜样，亲爱的。把他们当成榜样。”他用火铲轻敲着炉边，补充强调道，“他们让你干什么你就干什么，所有事情都要听他们的建议——尤其是机灵鬼的，亲爱的。他本人会成为一个大人物的，也会让你成为一个大人物，只要你学他的样子。——我的手帕是挂在口袋外面吗，亲爱的？”犹太佬说着，突然停了下来。","“Yes,” said the Jew; “that is, unless they should unexpectedly come across any, when they are out; and they won’t neglect it, if they do, my dear, depend upon it.Make ’em your models, my dear.Make ’em your models,” tapping the fire-shovel on the hearth to add force to his words; “do everything they bid you, and take their advice in all matters—especially the Dodger’s, my dear.He’ll be a great man himself, and will make you one too, if you take pattern by him.—Is my handkerchief hanging out of my pocket, my dear?” said the Jew, stopping short."
"“是的，先生。”奥利弗说。","“Yes, sir,” said Oliver."
"“看看你能不能把它拿出来，而不让我感觉到，就像今天早上我们玩游戏时你看见他们所做的那样。”","“See if you can take it out, without my feeling it; as you saw them do, when we were at play this morning.”"
"奥利弗用一只手提起口袋底部，像他看到机灵鬼所做的那样，并且用另一只手轻轻地把手帕从里面拉了出来。","Oliver held up the bottom of the pocket with one hand, as he had seen the Dodger hold it, and drew the handkerchief lightly out of it with the other."
"“弄好了吗？”犹太佬喊道。","“Is it gone?” cried the Jew."
"“在这儿，先生。”奥利弗说着，让他看看手里的手帕。","“Here it is, sir,” said Oliver, showing it in his hand."
"“你是个聪明的孩子，亲爱的。”顽皮的老绅士说道，还赞许地拍了拍奥利弗的头。“我从没见过这么聪明的孩子。给你一先令。如果照这样继续下去，你会成为这个时代最伟大的人物。现在过来，我来教你怎么把手帕上的记号弄掉。”","“You’re a clever boy, my dear,” said the playful old gentleman, patting Oliver on the head approvingly.“I never saw a sharper lad.Here’s a shilling for you.If you go on, in this way, you’ll be the greatest man of the time.And now come here, and I’ll show you how to take the marks out of the handkerchiefs.”"
"奥利弗纳闷在游戏里掏老绅士的口袋和他有机会成为大人物有什么关系。但是，想想犹太佬比他年长那么多，一定见多识广。他安静地跟着他到桌边，立刻全身心地投入到了新的学习中去。","Oliver wondered what picking the old gentleman’s pocket in play, had to do with his chances of being a great man.But, thinking that the Jew, being so much his senior, must know best, he followed him quietly to the table, and was soon deeply involved in his new study."
"第十章 奥利弗对新伙伴的性情越来越熟悉，花了高昂的代价获取经验。本章虽短，在这部传记中却非常重要","CHAPTER X Oliver becomes better acquainted with the characters of his new associates; and purchases experience at a high price. Being a short, but very important chapter, in this history"
"过了好些天，奥利弗都一直呆在犹太佬的房间里，把手帕上的记号挑掉（大量的手帕被带了回来），有时候参与之前已经描述过的那个游戏，两个男孩和犹太佬每天早上都照例要玩这个游戏。最后，他因为渴望新鲜空气，开始变得没精打采的，便多次诚挚地请求老绅士允许他和两个同伴一起出去干活。奥利弗已经见识到老绅士性情中那严厉的品行，这使得他更加渴望要积极地干活。每逢机灵鬼和查利·贝茨在晚上空手而归的时候，费金就会非常激愤地详细述说闲散懒惰的习惯有多可悲，并且为了强迫他们明白勤劳生活的道理，不给他们吃晚饭就让他们去睡觉。有一次，事实上，他确实做过了头，把他们俩打得跌下了楼梯，但这只是他执行道德训诫的尺度有些过头了而已。终于，奥利弗在一天早上获得了他热切寻求的许可。已经有两三天都没有手帕可以加工了，餐饭也变得相当粗淡。可能这些是老绅士表示同意的原因，但不管是不是，他告诉奥利弗可以去了，并且把他置于查利·贝茨和他朋友机灵鬼的共同监护之下。三个男孩出发了，机灵鬼像往常一样把袖子挽了起来，帽子歪戴着，贝茨少爷一路上把双手插在衣兜里闲逛，而奥利弗被他俩夹在中间，想着他们这是要去哪儿，他首先会去学习哪种技艺。他们走路的步调非常懒散、难看，就是在闲逛，奥利弗马上开始觉得他的同伴们是要欺骗老绅士，根本不去干活了。机灵鬼还有一种邪恶的癖好，那就是把小男孩们头上的帽子摘下来再扔得远远的，而查利·贝茨则展现出某些淡漠的财产所有权观念，他从路边的小摊上偷了好些苹果和洋葱，把它们塞进口袋里，他的那些口袋容量大得惊人，好像它们从各个方向把他的整套衣服内部都打通了似的。这些事看起来太糟糕了，奥利弗正想找个最好的借口，宣布他要回去了，机灵鬼的举止突然有了神秘的改变，这让奥利弗的想法被引到了另一个方向。他们正从克拉肯韦尔的开阔广场附近的一条窄巷里走出来，那地方的名字奇怪地变来变去，现在叫做“绿地”。这时机灵鬼突然停住了，把手指放在唇上，又把同伴们拉了回去，非常小心谨慎。“怎么了？”奥利弗问。","For many days, Oliver remained in the Jew’s room, picking the marks out of the pocket-handkerchief, (of which a great number were brought home,) and sometimes taking part in the game already described: which the two boys and the Jew played, regularly, every morning.At length, he began to languish for fresh air, and took many occasions of earnestly entreating the old gentleman to allow him to go out to work with his two companions.Oliver was rendered the more anxious to be actively employed, by what he had seen of the stern morality of the old gentleman’s character.Whenever the Dodger or Charley Bates came home at night, empty-handed, he would expatiate with great vehemence on the misery of idle and lazy habits; and would enforce upon them the necessity of an active life, by sending them supperless to bed.On one occasion, indeed, he even went so far as to knock them both down a flight of stairs; but this was carrying out his virtuous precepts to an unusual extent.At length, one morning, Oliver obtained the permission he had so eagerly sought.There had been no handkerchiefs to work upon, for two or three days, and the dinners had been rather meagre.Perhaps these were reasons for the old gentleman’s giving his assent; but, whether they were or no, he told Oliver he might go, and placed him under the joint guardianship of Charley Bates, and his friend the Dodger.The three boys sallied out; the Dodger with his coat-sleeves tucked up, and his hat cocked, as usual; Master Bates sauntering along with his hands in his pockets; and Oliver between them, wondering where they were going, and what branch of manufacture he would be instructed in, first. The pace at which they went, was such a very lazy, ill-looking saunter, that Oliver soon began to think his companions were going to deceive the old gentleman, by not going to work at all.The Dodger had a vicious propensity, too, of pulling the caps from the heads of small boys and tossing them down areas;while Charley Bates exhibited some very loose notions concerning the rights of property, by pilfering divers apples and onions from the stalls at the kennel sides, and thrusting them into pockets which were so surprisingly capacious, that they seemed to undermine his whole suit of clothes in every direction.These things looked so bad, that Oliver was on the point of declaring his intention of seeking his way back, in the best way he could; when his thoughts were suddenly directed into another channel, by a very mysterious change of behaviour on the part of the Dodger.They were just emerging from a narrow court not far from the open square in Clerkenwell, which is yet called, by some strange perversion of terms, “The Green”: when the Dodger made a sudden stop; and, laying his finger on his lip, drew his companions back again, with the greatest caution and circumspection.“What’s the matter?” demanded Oliver."
"“嘘！”机灵鬼回答。“你们看见书摊旁的那个老头了吗？”","“Hush!” replied the Dodger.“Do you see that old cove at the book-stall?”"
"“那边的那位老绅士？”奥利弗说。“是的，我看见了。”","“The old gentleman over the way?” said Oliver.“Yes, I see him.”"
"“就是他了。”机灵鬼说。","“He’ll do,” said the Doger."
"“典型的骗局。”查利·贝茨少爷评论道。","“A prime plant,” observed Master Charley Bates."
"奥利弗无比惊讶地看看这位，又看看那位，但是他不能提出任何质疑，因为两个男孩偷偷摸摸地穿过马路，鬼鬼祟祟地从后面贴近那位吸引了奥利弗注意的老绅士。奥利弗走在他们后面几步远，不知道该前进还是后退，只得惊愕地站在那里默默看着。","Oliver looked from one to the other, with the greatest surprise; but he was not permitted to make any inquiries; for the two boys walked stealthily across the road, and slunk close behind the old gentleman towards whom his attention had been directed.Oliver walked a few paces after them; and, not knowing whether to advance or retire, stood looking on in silent amazement."
"那位老绅士看起来非常体面尊贵，头发上扑了粉，戴着一副金边眼镜。他穿一件深绿色的大衣，衣领是黑天鹅绒的，下着一条白色裤子，胳膊下夹着一根漂亮的竹手杖。他从书摊上拿了一本书，站在那里认真地读了起来，就像他正坐在自己书房的扶手椅里。","The old gentleman was a very respectable-looking personage, with a powdered head and gold spectacles.He was dressed in a bottle-green coat with a black velvet collar; wore white trousers; and carried a smart bamboo cane under his arm.He had taken up a book from the stall, and there he stood, reading away, as hard as if he were in his elbow-chair, in his own study."
"事实上，他可能正处在那种幻想里，因为从他出神的样子来看，很显然他的眼中没有书摊，没有街道，也没有孩子们，或者简单地说，除了书以外别无他物。他正通读那本书，看到一页的末端，就翻到下页从第一行看起，带着极大的兴趣，万分热切地读了下去。","It is very possible that he fancied himself there, indeed; for it was plain, from his abstraction, that he saw not the book-stall, nor the street, nor the boys, nor, in short, anything but the book itself: which he was reading straight through: turning over the leaf when he got to the bottom of a page, beginning at the top line of the next one, and going regularly on, with the greatest interest and eagerness."
"奥利弗站在几步开外，尽量瞪大眼睛，看着机灵鬼把手插进老绅士的衣兜，从那儿拉出了一条手帕，他是多么惊骇，又多么担忧啊！他看见机灵鬼把手帕递给查利·贝茨，最后又见他们双双全速转过拐角跑掉了。","What was Oliver’s horror and alarm as he stood a few paces off, looking on with his eyelids as wide open as they would possibly go, to see the Dodger plunge his hand into the old gentleman’s pocket, and draw from thence a handkerchief!To see him hand the same to Charley Bates; and finally to behold them, both running away round the corner at full speed!"
"一瞬间所有关于手帕、手表、珠宝和犹太佬的谜团都冲进了这孩子的脑海。","In an instant the whole mystery of the hankerchiefs, and the watches, and the jewels, and the Jew, rushed upon the boy’s mind."
"他站了一会儿，因为恐惧，血液在全身血管里沸腾，他感觉自己像在燃烧着的烈火中一样，然后，他在困惑恐惧之中，虽然不知道自己在干什么，却撒开腿拼命奔跑起来。","He stood, for a moment, with the blood so tingling through all his veins from terror, that he felt as if he were in a burning fire; then, confused and frightened, he took to his heels; and, not knowing what he did, made off as fast as he could lay his feet to the ground."
"这些全发生在短短一分钟的时间里。就在奥利弗开跑的一瞬间，老绅士把手放进衣兜，发现手帕不见了，立刻转过身来。看到孩子以那么快的速度飞奔而去，他很自然地断定这孩子就是贼，于是用尽全力大叫：“抓小偷！”同时，他手里拿着书追了上去。","This was all done in a minute’s space.In the very instant when Oliver began to run, the old gentleman, putting his hand to his pocket, and missing his handkerchief, turned sharp round.Seeing the boy scudding away at such a rapid pace, he very naturally concluded him to be the depredator; and shouting “Stop thief!” with all his might, made off after him, book in hand."
"但是老绅士不是唯一一个大声叫喊抓贼的人。机灵鬼和贝茨少爷不想在大街上一直跑而引起大家的注意，只是退进了拐角处的第一个门洞。他们一听见叫喊声，又看见奥利弗在跑，就准确地猜出了事情原委，于是非常果断地挺身而出，也大叫道：“抓小偷！”并且像好市民那样加入了追捕。","But the old gentleman was not the only person who raised the hue-and-cry.The Dodger and Master Bates, unwilling to attract public attention by running down the open street, had merely retired into the very first doorway round the corner.They no sooner heard the cry, and saw Oliver running, than, guessing exactly how the matter stood, they issued forth with great promptitude; and, shouting “Stop thief!” too, joined in the pursuit like good citizens."
"尽管奥利弗是被哲人们一手带大的，在理论上，他却不了解自我保护是大自然的第一法则这一美妙格言。要是他知道，可能会对此有所准备。然而，他全无准备，这使他更为惊慌，所以他像阵风似的跑了，老绅士和两个男孩在他后面大吼大叫。","Although Oliver had been brought up by philosophers, he was not theoretically acquainted with the beautiful axiom that self-preservation is the first law of nature.If he had been, perhaps he would have been prepared for this.Not being prepared, however, it alarmed him the more; so away he went like the wind, with the old gentleman and the two boys roaring and shouting behind him."
"“抓小偷！抓小偷！”这声音中有一种魔力。店主离开了柜台，车夫丢下了马车，屠夫扔下了托盘，面包师抛开了篮子，牛奶商扔掉了桶，跑差的甩开了包裹，学生扔下了弹珠，铺路人落下了镐，孩子则丢开了球拍。他们乱哄哄地跑着，一片仓促忙乱：撕扯着，呼喊着，叫嚷着，转过街角时撞倒了前面的人，弄得鸡飞狗跳；街道上，广场上，院子里，到处都回响着这些声音。","“Stop thief!Stop thief!”There is a magic in the sound.The tradesman leaves his counter, and the car-man his waggon; the butcher throws down his tray; the baker his basket; the milkman his pail; the errand-boy his parcels; the school-boy his marbles; the paviour his pickaxe; the child his battledore.Away they run, pell-mell, helter-skelter, slap-dash: tearing, yelling, screaming, knocking down the passengers as they turn the corners, rousing up the dogs, and astonishing the fowls: and streets, squares, and courts, re-echo with the sound."
"“抓小偷！抓小偷！”上百个声音齐声叫喊着，每转一个弯，人群就壮大一些。他们快速前进，踩得泥浆飞溅，人行道咚咚直响。木偶戏正演到关键之处，全体观众却把主角潘趣丢在一边，打开窗户跑了出来，一哄而上，加入了奔跑的人群，壮大了喊声，并为这呼喊增添了新的活力：“抓小偷！抓小偷！”","“Stop thief!Stop thief!”The cry is taken up by a hundred voices, and the crowd accumulate at every turning.Away they fly, splashing through the mud, and rattling along the pavements: up go the windows, out run the people, onward bear the mob, a whole audience desert Punch in the very thickest of the plot, and, joining the rushing throng, swell the shout, and lend fresh vigour to the cry, “Stop thief!Stop thief!”"
"“抓小偷！抓小偷！”一种要狩猎某物的欲望深深嵌在人类的心中。一个气喘吁吁的可怜孩子精疲力竭地喘着气，看起来非常害怕，眼中神情十分痛苦，脸上淌下大颗的汗珠，他绷紧了身上的每一根神经在追捕者前面跑着，而他们跟在他后面，一步步越来越近，为他力气逐渐减小而欢呼。“抓小偷！”唉，看在上帝的份上，就算只是出于怜悯，也请抓住他吧！","“Stop thief!Stop thief!”There is a passion for hunting something deeply implanted in the human breast.One wretched breathless child, panting with exhaustion; terror in his looks; agony in his eyes; large drops of perspiration streaming down his face; strains every nerve to make head upon his pursuers; and as they follow on his track, and gain upon him every instant, they hail his decreasing strength with joy.“Stop thief!”Ay, stop him for God’s sake, were it only in mercy!"
"终于抓住了！绝妙的一击！他倒在人行道上，人群热切地聚拢在他周围，每个新来的都推搡着往前挤，好看上一眼。“靠边站！”“让他透透气！”“瞎说！他不配。”“那位绅士在哪儿？”“在那儿，正朝这条街来。”“给那位绅士腾个地方！”“是这个孩子吗，先生！”“是的。”","Stopped at last!A clever blow.He is down upon the pavement; and the crowd eagerly gather round him: each new comer, jostling and struggling with the others to catch a glimpse.“Stand aside!”“Give him a little air!”“Nonsense! he don’t deserve it.”“Where’s the gentleman?”“Here his is, coming down the street.”“Make room there for the gentleman!”“Is this the boy, sir!”“Yes.”"
"奥利弗躺在那里，浑身都是泥巴和尘土，嘴巴冒着血，胡乱扫视着围在他周围的那堆面庞，这时，那位老绅士被人过分殷勤地拖了过来，推进了跑在最前面的那些追捕者围成的圈子里。","Oliver lay, covered with mud and dust, and bleeding from the mouth, looking wildly round upon the heap of faces that surrounded him, when the old gentleman was officiously dragged and pushed into the circle by the foremost of the pursuers."
"“是的，”绅士说，“我恐怕就是这个孩子。”","“Yes,” said the gentleman, “I am afraid it is the boy.”"
"“恐怕！”人群窃窃私语。“好个小家伙！”","“Afraid!” murmured the crowd.“That’s a good ’un!”"
"“可怜的家伙！”老绅士说，“他受伤了。”","“Poor fellow!” said the gentleman, “he has hurt himself.”"
"“我干的，先生。”一个非常笨拙的家伙走上前来说道，“我一肘子撞在他嘴上，自己也伤得很严重。是我抓到他的，先生。”","“I did that, sir,” said a great lubberly fellow, stepping forward; “and preciously I cut my knuckle agin’ his mouth.I stopped him, sir.”"
"那家伙笑嘻嘻地碰了一下帽子，期望自己的伤痛有所回报，但是，老绅士带着一脸厌恶的表情看了他一眼，不安地环顾四周，仿佛打算自行离开。要不是一个警官（在此种情形下他们总是最后一个到的）那时挤进了人群，抓住了奥利弗的领子，他很有可能试着那么做，并因此引起另一场追逐。","The follow touched his hat with a grin, expecting something for his pains; but, the old gentleman, eyeing him with an expression of dislike, look anxiously round, as if he contemplated running away himself: which it is very possible he might have attempted to do, and thus have afforded another chase, had not a police officer (who is generally the last person to arrive in such cases) at that moment made his way through the crowd, and seized Oliver by the collar."
"“喂，起来。”警官粗鲁地说。","“Come, get up,” said the man, roughly."
"“真的不是我，先生。真的，真的，是另外两个孩子干的。”奥利弗激动地紧握双手，看着四周说，“他们就在这里某个地方。”","“It wasn’t me indeed, sir.Indeed, indeed, it was two other boys,” said Oliver, clasping his hands passionately, and looking round.“They are here somewhere.”"
"“噢不，他们不在。”警官说。他意欲表示讽刺，但偏偏真是这样，追捕过程中，机灵鬼和查利·贝茨在经过就近的第一个院子时就排成纵队出发，逃之夭夭了。","“Oh no, they ain’t,” said the officer.He meant this to be ironical, but it was true besides; for the Dodger and Charley Bates had filed off down the first convenient court they came to."
"“喂，起来！”","“Come, get up!”"
"“别伤害他。”老绅士同情地说。","“Don’t hurt him,” said the old gentleman, compassionately."
"“噢，不，我不会伤害他的。”警官回答，几乎把奥利弗的外套从背上扯了下来，由此作为证据。“喂，我知道你们，这不管用的。你要不要站起来，你这个小恶魔？”","“Oh no, I won’t hurt him,” replied the officer, tearing his jacket half off his back, in proof thereof.“Come, I know you; it won’t do.Will you stand upon your legs, you young devil?”"
"奥利弗几乎站不住，他设法爬了起来，立刻被警官拽着外套领口，沿着街道快步拖走了。绅士在警官旁边和他们一起走着，凡是能完成走在他们前面这一壮举的人们，都不时回头盯着奥利弗看。孩子们发出胜利的叫喊，往前走去。","Oliver, who could hardly stand, made a shift to raise himself on his feet, and was at once lugged along the streets by the jacket-collar, at a rapid pace.The gentleman walked on with them by the officer’s side; and as many of the crowd as could achieve the feat, got a little ahead, and stared back at Oliver from time to time.The boys shouted in triumph; and on they went."
"第十一章 对治安官范昂其人以及他办案方式的一个小例子的详述","CHAPTER XI Treats of Mr. Fang the police magistrate; and furnishes a slight specimen of his mode of administering justice "
"这桩案子发生在一个众人皆知的首都警察局的辖区内，实际上就发生在该警察局附近。围观群众得到的满足，也就是随着奥利弗走过两三条街，走到一个叫玛当山的地方。他被领着走过一条低矮的拱道，走上肮脏的庭院，从后门进入了即决审判室。他们转进一个铺着石板的院子，在那里遇到一个长着络腮胡的壮汉，那人手里拿着一串钥匙。","The offence had been committed within the district, and indeed in the immediate neighborhood of, a very notorious metropolitan police office.The crowd had only the satisfaction of accompanying Oliver through two or three streets, and down a place called Mutton Hill, when he was led beneath a low archway, and up a dirty court, into this dispensary of summary justice, by the back way.It was a small paved yard into which they turned; and here they encountered a stout man with a bunch of whiskers on his face, and a bunch of keys in his hand."
"“又出了什么事啊？”他漫不经心地问。","“What’s the matter now?” said the man carelessly."
"“抓到一个偷手帕的小贼。”押着奥利弗的警察说。","“A young fogle-hunter,” replied the man who had Oliver in charge."
"“先生，你是那个被偷的人吗？”拿着钥匙的大汉问。","“Are you the party that’s been robbed, sir?” inquired the man with the keys."
"“是的，是我，”老先生回答，“不过我并不确定是不是这个孩子偷走了我的手帕。我——我不想追究这事。”","“Yes, I am,” replied the old gentleman; “but I am not sure that this boy actually took the handkerchief.I—I would rather not press the case.”"
"“先生，现在得先去见见治安官，”大汉说，“长官大人就快忙完了。你这个该上绞架的小贼，给我过来！”","“Must go before the magistrate now, sir,” replied the man.“His worship will be disengaged in half a minute.Now, young gallows!”"
"他边说边打开一个石砌牢房的门，他的话就是对奥利弗发出的进门邀请。他在牢房里对奥利弗进行了一番搜查，但是在他身上什么都没搜到，门又锁上了。","This was an invitation for Oliver to enter through a door which he unlocked as he spoke, and which led into a stone cell.Here he was searched; and nothing being found upon him, locked up."
"这间牢房在形状和大小上都有些像地窖，只是没有那么亮。里面脏得让人完全无法忍受，因为现在是周一早上；从上周六晚上开始，这里已经关过六个醉汉，现在他们被关到别处去了。不过，这还不是什么大问题。在我们的警察局里，每天夜里都有人因为鸡毛蒜皮的小事——这种说法值得注意——被关进地牢。与此相比，新门监狱那些经过审讯、定罪、宣判死刑的残暴重罪犯，简直算是住在宫殿了。任何怀疑这一点的人，都来比较一下吧。","This cell was in shape and size something like an area cellar, only not so light.It was most intolerably dirty; for it was Monday morning; and it had been tenanted by six drunken people, who had been locked up, elsewhere, since Saturday night.But this is little.In our station-houses, men and women are every night confined on the most trivial charges—the word is worth noting—in dungeons, compared with which, those in Newgate, occupied by the most atrocious felons, tried, found guilty, and under sentence of death, are palaces.Let any one who doubts this, compare the two."
"钥匙在锁孔里发出咔哒一声，这时老先生看上去几乎与奥利弗一样沮丧了。他长叹了一口气，看向那本引发了这所有乱子的无辜的书。","The old gentleman looked almost as rueful as Oliver when the key grated in the lock.He turned with a sigh to the book, which had been the innocent cause of all this disturbance."
"“那孩子的脸上貌似有种什么东西，”老先生一边慢慢走开，一边用书的封皮轻叩着自己的下巴，他在心里嘀咕着，“这是某种能够触动我、吸引我的东西。他会不会是无辜的呢？这张脸似乎有点像——并且，”老先生突然停住了，抬头凝视着天空惊叫道，“天哪！——我从前在哪里见过和他相似的长相？”","“There is something in that boy’s face,” said the old gentleman to himself as he walked slowly away, tapping his chin with the cover of the book, in a thoughtful manner; “something that touches and interests me.Can he be innocent?He looked like—By the bye,” exclaimed the old gentleman, halting very abruptly, and staring up into the sky, “Bless my soul!—where have I seen something like that look before?”"
"老先生沉思了片刻，然后走进了后面一间通着院子的接待室，脸上仍带着相似的苦苦思索的表情；他默默退到一个角落里，回忆着许多年以来一直藏在内心深处那昏暗大幕后面的一张张面孔。“不，”他一边摇头一边说，“这一定是想象。”","After musing for some minutes, the old gentleman walked, with the same meditative face, into a back anteroom opening from the yard; and there, retiring into a corner, called up before his mind’s eye a vast amphitheatre of faces over which a dusky curtain had hung for many years.“No,” said the old gentleman, shaking his head; “it must be imagination."
"他再一次回顾这些面孔。他已经将它们召唤到眼前，但是要把多年来一直遮挡在它们之上的幕布拉开却并非易事。那一张张的面孔中，有朋友的，也有敌人的，还有许多挤进脑海的面孔看上去几乎已经完全不认识了；那些曾经如花似玉的少女，现在已到了风烛残年；有些面孔虽然早已长眠于地下，变了模样，但是灵魂的力量超越了死亡，依然像往日那样鲜活而美丽，召回了那炯炯有神的双眸，爽朗清脆的笑声，光彩耀人的灵魂，这一切都冲出泥土的束缚与掩饰，在坟墓里向世人娓娓诉说其美好；这黄土下的美好虽然有所改变，但却更加地显著突出，并超脱了尘世，成为一盏明灯，只为在通往天国的路上洒下一道柔和而清丽的光辉。","He wandered over them again.He had called them into view, and it was not easy to replace the shroud that had so long concealed them.There were the faces of friends, and foes, and of many that had been almost strangers peering intrusively from the crowd; there were the faces of young and blooming girls that were now old women;there were faces that the grave had changed and closed upon, but which the mind, superior to its power, still dressed in their old freshness and beauty, calling back the lustre of the eyes, the brightness of the smile, the beaming of the soul through its mask of clay, and whispering of beauty beyond the tomb, changed but to be heightened, and taken from earth only to be set up as a light, to shed a soft and gentle glow upon the path to Heaven."
"但是，老先生终究也没能想起奥利弗的脸与谁的脸有相似之处。他再次长叹一声，向自己刚才记起的往事依依作别，并为自己只是心不在焉感到庆幸，把一切记忆重新埋进了那本发霉的书里。","But the old gentleman could recall no one countenance of which Oliver’s features bore a trace.So, he heaved a sigh over the recollections he awakened; and being, happily for himself, an absent old gentleman, buried them again in the pages of the musty book."
"有人碰了一下他的肩膀，他从回忆中醒了过来。那个拿着钥匙的大汉要老先生随他一道进法庭去。他赶紧合上书，随即被领着去拜见那位声名显赫的范昂长官。","He was roused by a touch on the shoulder, and a request from the man with the keys to follow him into the office.He closed his book hastily; and was at once ushered into the imposing presence of the renowned Mr. Fang."
"办公室是个前厅，墙壁上镶有护墙板。范昂长官坐在上座的栏杆后面，可怜的小奥利弗被安置在门边的木栅栏里，被这威严的场面吓得瑟瑟发抖。","The office was a front parlour, with a panelled wall.Mr. Fang sat behind a bar, at the upper end; and on one side the door was a sort of wooden pen in which poor little Oliver was already deposited; trembling very much at the awfulness of the scene."
"范昂长官中等个子，十分消瘦，腰板细长，脖子僵直。他的头发不多，大部分都长在脑袋两侧和后脑勺上。他的神色很严厉，面色很红。如果他确实没有酗酒的习惯的话，他完全可以起诉自己的长相犯有欺骗罪，并获得一笔数目可观的损失费了。","Mr. Fang was a lean, long-backed, stiff-necked, middle-sized man, with no great quantity of hair, and what he had, growing on the back and sides of his head.His face was stern, and much flushed.If he were really not in the habit of drinking rather more than was exactly good for him, he might have brought action against his countenance for libel, and have recovered heavy damages."
"老先生毕恭毕敬地鞠了个躬后，朝治安官的书桌走过去，一边递上名片一边说道：“长官，这是我的名片。”说完，他退后了一步，又客气而绅士地点了点头，等待着对方发问。","The old gentleman bowed respectfully; and advancing to the magistrate’s desk, said, suiting the action to the word, “That is my name and address, sir.”He then withdrew a pace or two; and, with another polite and gentlemanly inclination of the head, waited to be questioned."
"此刻，范昂长官正好在阅读当天早上报纸上的一篇社论，文章谈到了他最近的一次裁决，第三百五十次提请内政大臣对他加以特别注意。他相当恼火，抬头的时候眉头紧锁。","Now, it so happened that Mr. Fang was at that moment perusing a leading article in a newspaper of the morning, adverting to some recent decision of his, and commending him, for the three hundred and fiftieth time, to the special and particular notice of the Secretary of State for the Home Department.He was out of temper; and he looked up with an angry scowl."
"“你是谁？”范昂长官问道。","“Who are you?” said Mr. Fang."
"老绅士带着几分诧异，指了指自己的名片。","The old gentleman pointed, with some surprise, to his card."
"“警官！”范昂长官傲慢地用报纸挑开名片，说道，“这家伙是谁？”","“Officer!” said Mr. Fang, tossing the card contemptuously away with the newspaper.“Who is this fellow?”"
"“长官，我的名字——”老绅士很有风度地说，“我的名字是布朗洛，长官。请允许我问一声长官的名字。长官仗着自己是执法者，就无缘无故地侮辱一个体面之人。”布朗洛先生说着，环视了一周，好像在找一个能给他满意答案的人。","“My name, sir,” said the old gentleman, speaking like a gentleman, “my name, sir, is Brownlow.Permit me to inquire the name of the magistrate who offers a gratuitous and unprovoked insult to a respectable person, under the protection of the bench.”Saying this, Mr. Brownlow looked around the office as if in search of some person who would afford him the required information."
"“警官！”范昂长官边说边把报纸扔到了一边，“这家伙犯了什么案子？”","“Officer!” said Mr. Fang, throwing the paper on one side, “what’s this fellow charged with?”"
"“他没犯案子，大人，”警官回答，“他是原告，大人。”","“He’s not charged at all, your worship,” replied the officer.“He appears against this boy, your worship.”"
"范昂长官完全是明知故问，他这个问题既让人恼火，也用不着担风险。","His worship knew this perfectly well; but it was a good annoyance, and a safe one."
"“他是要告这个小孩，是吧？”范昂先生傲慢地边说边将布朗洛先生从头到脚打量了一番。“让他宣誓！”","“Appears against the boy, does he?” said Mr. Fang, surveying Mr. Brownlow contemptuously from head to foot.“Swear him!”"
"“在我宣誓之前，必须先说两句，”布朗洛先生说，“就是说，要不是我亲身经历，我确实不敢相信——”“住嘴，先生！”范昂长官专横地打断了他。","“Before I am sworn, I must beg to say one word,” said Mr. Brownlow; “and that is, that I really never, without actual experience, could have believed—” “Hold your tongue, sir!” said Mr. Fang, peremptorily."
"“我必须得说，先生！”老先生回答。","“I will not, sir!” replied the old gentleman."
"“立刻住嘴！否则我就把你赶出法庭！”范昂长官说道，“你这个粗鲁无礼的家伙。你竟敢威胁治安官！”","“Hold your tongue this instant, or I’ll have you turned out of the office!” said Mr. Fang.“You’re an insolent impertinent fellow.How dare you bully a magistrate!”"
"“什么！”老先生涨红了脸，大叫一声。","“What!” exclaimed the old gentleman, reddening."
"“让这个家伙宣誓！”范昂长官朝书记员吼道，“别的话我统统不听。让他宣誓！”","“Swear this person!” said Fang to the clerk.“I’ll not hear another word.Swear him.”"
"布朗洛先生非常恼火，但是他考虑到如果发泄一通可能只会伤害那个孩子，就强忍着心头的怒火屈服了，立刻宣了誓。","Mr. Brownlow’s indignation was greatly roused; but reflecting perhaps, that he might only injure the boy by giving vent to it, he suppressed his feelings and submitted to be sworn at once."
"“噢，”范昂长官说，“你指控这个孩子什么？你有什么要说的，先生？”","“Now,” said Fang, “what’s the charge against this boy? What have you got to say, sir?”"
"“我当时正在一个书摊边上——”布朗洛先生开始讲述。","“I was standing at a bookstall—” Mr. Brownlow began."
"“停一下，先生！”范昂长官说，“警察！警察在哪儿？喏，叫这个警察宣誓。说吧，警察，怎么回事？”","“Hold your tongue, sir,” said Mr. Fang.“Policeman!Where’s the policeman?Here, swear this policeman.Now, policeman, what is this?”"
"那位警察非常谦恭地讲了他是如何办案，如何搜查了奥利弗全身并一无所获；他告诉长官他知道的就是这些了。","The policeman, with becoming humility, related how he had taken the charge; how he had searched Oliver, and found nothing on his person; and how that was all he knew about it."
"“有证人吗？”范昂长官问。","“Are there any witnesses?” inquired Mr. Fang."
"“没有，大人。”警察回答。","“None, your worship,” replied the policeman."
"范昂坐着沉默了几分钟，然后转向原告，大发雷霆地说：","Mr. Fang sat silent for some minutes, and then, turning round to the prosecutor, said in a towering passion."
"“你到底是要控告这个孩子，还是不要？你已经宣誓了。喂，你要是光站在这儿，拒绝拿出证据，我就可以以藐视法庭罪严惩你，我要——”他要干什么，或者说要谁来干，没有人知道，因为就在这时候，书记员和那名狱卒一起大声咳嗽了起来。前者又将一本沉甸甸的书掉到了地上，那句话当然由于这个意外情况没被听完整。","“Do you mean to state what your complaint against this boy is, man, or do you not?You have been sworn.Now, if you stand there, refusing to give evidence, I’ll punish you for disrespect to the bench; I will, by—” By what, or by whom, nobody knows, for the clerk and jailor coughed very loud, just at the right moment; and the former dropped a heavy book upon the floor, thus preventing the word from being heard—accidently, of course."
"尽管遭到了无数阻碍和反复侮辱，布朗洛先生还是试图把案情说一遍。他说，由于当时感到意外，见那个孩子一个劲跑，便追了上去。他表明了自己的希望，如果长官相信那个孩子尽管不是小偷，却跟小偷们有牵连，也希望长官能够在法律允许的范围内从轻发落。","With many interruptions, and repeated insults, Mr. Brownlow contrived to state his case; observing that, in the surprise of the moment, he had run after the boy because he had saw him running away; and expressing his hope that, if the magistrate should believe him, although not actually the thief, to be connected with the thieves, he would deal as leniently with him as justice would allow."
"“他已经受了伤，”老先生最后说，“而且我担心，”他望着栅栏那面，努力补充道，“我确实担心那个孩子生病了。”","“He has been hurt already,” said the old gentleman in conclusion.“And I fear,” he added, with great energy, looking towards the bar, “I really fear that he is ill.”"
"“噢！是的，我想可能是这样！”范昂长官冷笑着说道，“少来这一套了。这个小流氓，这些都骗不了我。你叫什么名字？”","“Oh! yes，I dare say!” said Mr. Fang, with a sneer.“Come, none of your tricks here, you young vagabond; they won’t do.What’s your name?”"
"奥利弗努力想应一声，但是说不出话来。他面色苍白，周围的一切似乎都在眼前旋转。","Oliver tried to reply but his tongue failed him.He was deadly pale; and the whole place seemed turning round and round."
"“你叫什么名字？你这个厚脸皮的无赖！”范昂长官继续问。“警官，他叫什么？”","“What’s your name, you hardened scoundrel?” demanded Mr. Fang.“Officer, what’s his name?”"
"这话是对站在栏杆旁边的一个穿条纹背心的率直的老头说的。老头向奥利弗弯下腰，又问了一遍，发现奥立弗确实没法理解这问题。老头知道奥利弗不回答只会让治安官更加恼怒，还会加重判决，于是就冒险瞎编起来。","This was addressed to a bluff old fellow, in a striped waistcoat, who was standing by the bar.He bent over Oliver, and repeated the inquiry; but finding him really incapable of understanding the question; and knowing that his not replying would only infuriate the magistrate the more, and add to the severity of his sentence; he hazarded a guess."
"“他说他叫汤姆·怀特，大人。”这位好心的警察说。","“He says his name’s Tom White, your worship,” said the kind-hearted thief-taker."
"“噢，他不是说不出来吗，是吗？”范昂说道，“好极了，好极了。他住在哪里？”","“Oh, he won’t speak out, won’t he?” said Fang.“Very well, very well.Where does he live?”"
"“他说没个准儿，大人。”他回答道，再次装作听到了奥利弗的回答。","“Where he can, your worship,” replied the officer; again pretending to receive Oliver’s answer."
"“他的父母呢？”范昂继续询问。","“Has he any parents?” inquired Mr.Fang."
"“他说他们在他小时候就已经死了，大人。”警官冒险取了个寻常的回答。","“He says they died in his infancy, your worship,” replied the officer: hazarding the usual reply."
"问到这儿，奥利弗抬起了头，用哀求的目光环视了一下四周，有气无力地请求给他一口水喝。","At this point of the inquiry, Oliver raised his head; and, looking round with imploring eyes, murmured a feeble prayer for a draught of water."
"“胡说八道！”范昂长官说，“别想把我当傻瓜。”","“Stuff and nonsense!” said Mr. Fang: “don’t try to make a fool of me.”"
"“大人，我想他是真的生病了。”警官劝道。","“I think he really is ill, your worship,” remonstrated the officer."
"“我比你清楚。”范昂先生说。","“I know better,” said Mr. Fang."
"“长官，快扶住他，”老先生说着，不禁伸出了双手，“他就要倒了。”","“Take care of him, officer,” said the old gentleman, raising his hands instinctively; “he’ll fall down.”"
"“站到一边去，警官，”范昂嚷道，“他要是想倒就倒吧。”","“Stand away, officer,” cried Fang; “let him, if he likes.”"
"承蒙长官恩准，奥利弗一阵眩晕，倒在了地板上。法庭里的人面面相觑，但是无人敢动。","Oliver availed himself of the kind permission, and fell to the floor in a fainting fit.The men in the office looked at each other, but no one dared to stir."
"“我就知道他在装病，”范昂说，仿佛这是毋庸置疑的事实，“让他躺在那儿吧，要不了多久他就会厌烦了。”","“I knew he was shamming,” said Fang, as if this were incontestable proof of the fact.“Let him lie there; he’ll soon be tired of that.”"
"“大人，您打算如何处理这个案子？”书记员低声问道。","“How do you propose to deal with the case, sir?” inquired the clerk in a low voice."
"“即决裁判，”范昂长官说，“关他三个月——当然了，苦工是少不了的。退庭。”","“Summarily,” replied Mr. Fang.“He stands committed for three months—hard labour of course.Clear the office.”"
"门应声打开了，两个大汉准备将昏迷的奥利弗带去牢房。这时一个穿着黑色礼服的老人匆匆闯进了法庭，朝法官席走去。他穿着得体，但是并不富贵。","The door was opened for this purpose, and a couple of men were preparing to carry the insensible boy to his cell; when an elderly man of decent but poor appearance, clad in an old suit of black, rushed hastily into the office, and advanced towards the bench."
"“等一下，等一下！别把他带走！看在上帝的份上，请等一下！”这个新来的人气喘吁吁地叫道。","“Stop, stop! don’t take him away!For Heaven’s sake stop a moment!” cried the new comer, breathless with haste."
"尽管法律的守护神们在这样的法庭里，对女王陛下的臣民，尤其是那些比较贫困的臣民的自由、名誉、人格，甚至生命肆意践踏，尽管在这四壁之内，这种足以叫天使们哭瞎双眼的荒唐闹剧每天都在上演，但是公众无法目睹这一切，除了每天报纸向他们泄露的那一点。范昂长官看到这位不速之客如此无礼地闯了进来，勃然大怒。","Although the presiding Genii in such an office as this, exercise a summary and arbitrary power over the liberties, the good name, the character, almost the lives, of Her Majesty’s subjects, expecially of the poorer class; and although, within such walls, enough fantastic tricks are daily played to make the angels blind with weeping; they are closed to the public, save through the medium of the daily press.Mr. Fang was consequently not a little indignant to see an unbidden guest enter in such irreverent disorder."
"“这是怎么回事？这是谁？把这人给我赶出去！退庭！”范昂先生吼道。","“What is this?Who is this?Turn this man out.Clear the office!” cried Mr. Fang."
"“我必须要说，”那人大声说，“别想把我赶出去。事情我都看见了。书摊是我开的。我请求宣誓。别想封住我的嘴。范昂长官，你必须听我说，你不能拒绝，先生。”","“I will speak,” cried the man; “I will not be turned out.I saw it all.I keep the book-stall.I demand to be sworn.I will not be put down.Mr. Fang, you must hear me.You must not refuse, sir.”"
"那人的请求是正当的。他态度很坚决，事态已经发展到了严重的地步，不能马虎过去了。","The man was right.His manner was determined; and the matter was growing rather too serious to be hushed up."
"“让他宣誓。”范昂长官不高兴地吼道，“喂，说吧，你有什么要说的？”","“Swear the man,” growled Mr. Fang with a very ill grace.“Now, man, what have you got to say?”"
"“事情是这样的，”那人说，“我亲眼看到三个孩子，另外两个男孩和这名被告，在马路对面闲逛，那时候这个老先生正在看书。偷东西的是另一个孩子。我看见他下手了，我还看见这个孩子完全惊呆了。”说到这儿，这位可敬的书摊老板才缓过一口气来，更有条理地将这桩抢劫案的详细情况讲了一遍。","“This,” said the man: “I saw three boys: two others and the prisoner here: loitering on the opposite side of the way, when this gentleman was reading.The robbery was committed by another boy.I saw it done; and I saw that this boy was perfectly amazed and stupified by it.”Having by this time recovered a little breath, the worthy book-stall keeper proceeded to relate, in a more coherent manner the exact circumstances of the robbery."
"“你干吗不早点来？”范昂停了一会儿说道。","“Why didn’t you come here before?” said Fang, after a pause."
"“我没找到人给我看铺子，”书摊老板说，“那些本来能帮忙的人全加入了追赶。我五分钟之前才找着人，就一路跑了过来。”","“I hadn’t a soul to mind the shop,” replied the man.“Everybody who could have helped me, had joined in the pursuit.I could get nobody till five minutes ago; and I’ve run here all the way.”"
"“原告当时正在看书，是吗？”范昂又停了一会儿，继续询问。","“The prosecutor was reading, was he?” inquried Fang, after another pause."
"“是的，”书摊老板回答，“那本书还在他手里呢。”","“Yes,” replied the man.“The very book he has in his hand.”"
"“呵，是那本书，嗯？”范昂问，“他付钱了没有？”","“Oh, that book, eh?” said Fang.“Is it paid for?”"
"“没，还没有。”书摊老板带着一丝笑意答道。","“No, it is not,” replied the man, with a smile."
"“天哪，我完全把这事给忘了！”有些恍惚的老先生无辜地叫道。","“Dear me, I forgot all about it!” exclaimed the absent old gentleman, innocently."
"“好一位老实人啊！还来告发一个可怜的孩子。”范昂故意开着玩笑，让自己显得很有人情味。“我想，老先生，你已经在可疑而又不光彩的情形下，把那本书占为己有了。大概你还以为自己运气不错吧，这本书的主人不打算提出起诉。你就把这当成一次教训吧，否则，总有一天你要受到法律制裁的。把那个小孩放了吧。退庭！”","“A nice person to prefer a charge against a poor boy!” said Fang, with a comical effort to look humane.“I consider, sir, that you have obtained possession of that book, under very suspicious and disreputable circumstances; and you may think yourself very fortunate that the owner of the property declines to prosecute.Let this be a lesson to you, my man, or the law will overtake you yet.The boy is discharged.Clear the office!”"
"“天啊！”布朗洛先生忍了许久的怒气终于爆发了，“天啊！我要——”“退庭！”治安官打断他，“警官们，你们都听见了没有？退庭！”","“D—n me!” cried the old gentleman, bursting out with the rage he had kept down so long, “d—n me!I’ll—” “Clear the office!” said the magistrate.“Officers, do you hear?Clear the office!”"
"这项命令被执行了，愤怒的布朗洛先生被轰了出去。他一手拿着书，一手握着竹杖，怒气冲冲，因在法庭上受到的蔑视而气得几欲发狂。他来到院子里，怒气立刻消散了。小奥利弗仰面躺在人行道上，衬衣已经解开，两鬓被浇了些凉水，脸色惨白，身体抽动，不停地打着寒战。","The mandate was obeyed; and the indignant Mr. Brownlow was conveyed out, with the book in one hand, and the bamboo cane in the other: in a perfect phrenzy of rage and defiance.He reached the yard; and his passion vanished in a moment.Little Oliver Twist lay on his back on the pavement, with his shirt unbuttoned, and his temples bathed with water; his face a deadly white; and a cold tremble convulsing his whole frame."
"“可怜的孩子，可怜的孩子！”布朗洛先生俯下腰来，“劳驾哪一位叫辆马车。快！”","“Poor boy, poor boy!” said Mr. Brownlow, bending over him.“Call a coach, somebody, pray.Directly!”"
"马车来了，奥利弗被小心翼翼地抱到了座位上，老先生也上了马车，坐到另一个座位上。","A coach was obtained, and Oliver having been carefully laid on the seat, the old gentleman got in and sat himself on the other."
"“我能和您一起去吗？”书摊老板边朝里看边说。","“May I accompany you?” said the book-stall keeper, looking in."
"“哎呀，当然可以。我亲爱的先生。”布朗洛先生赶紧说道，“我都把您给忘记了。天哪，天哪！我还拿着这本倒霉的书呢！快上来。这可怜的小家伙！不能再耽误时间了。”","“Bless me, yes, my dear sir,” said Mr. Brownlow quickly.“I forgot you.Dear, dear!I have this unhappy book still!Jump in.Poor fellow!There’s no time to lose.”"
"书摊老板跳上车；马车开走了。","The book-stall keeper got into the coach; and away they drove."
"第十二章 对奥利弗得到的前所未有的照顾，以及那位快乐的老先生及其年轻朋友们的叙述","CHAPTER XII In which Oliver is taken better care of than he ever was before. And in which the narrative reverts to the merry old gentleman and his youthful friends."
"马车咔嗒咔嗒地行驶，路线几乎和当初奥利弗由机灵鬼陪着第一次来伦敦时走的一样；过了伊斯灵顿街的安琪儿酒店，马车便转向了另一条路，一直来到本顿维尔附近一条安静的林阴小道，在一所整洁的小屋前停下了。在这儿，布朗洛先生立刻为奥利弗准备好了一张床，他仔细地把小家伙安顿得十分舒适。奥利弗受到了无微不至的悉心照顾。","The coach rattled away, over nearly the same ground as that which Oliver had traversed when he first entered London in company with the Dodger; and, turning a different way when it reached the Angel at Islington, stopped at length before a neat house, in a quiet shady street near Pentonville.Here, a bed was prepared, without loss of time, in which Mr. Brownlow saw his young charge carefully and comfortably deposited; and here, he was tended with a kindness and solicitude that knew no bounds."
"但是，一连几天过去了，奥利弗始终处于昏迷当中，对这些新朋友们的照顾全然不知。太阳升起来又落下，再升起来，又落下去；日子一天又一天地过去了。小奥利弗依然舒展着身子，躺在这来之不易的床上，饱受着热病的煎熬，日渐消瘦。蠕虫贪食死尸，也不如这文火烘烤活人来得有把握。","But, for many days, Oliver remained insensible to all the goodness of his new friends.The sun rose and sank, and rose and sank again, and many times after that; and still the boy lay stretched on his uneasy bed, dwindling away beneath the dry and wasting heat of fever.The worm does not work more surely on the dead body, than does this slow creeping fire upon the living frame."
"这天，奥利弗终于醒了。他身体虚弱，瘦骨嶙峋，面色惨白，俨然刚从一场漫长的噩梦中醒来。他虚弱地从床上起身，用颤抖的胳膊支撑着头，不安地四处张望。","Weak, and thin, and pallid, he awoke at last from what seemed to have been a long and troubled dream.Feebly raising himself in the bed, with his head resting on his trembling arm, he looked anxiously around."
"“这是什么地方？我在哪儿？”奥利弗说道，“这不是我睡觉的那个地方。”","“What room is this?Where have I been brought to?” said Oliver.“This is not the place I went to sleep in.”"
"他的身体极度虚弱无力，因此声音很微弱。但是立刻就有人听到了。床头的帘子马上拉开了，一位衣着整洁讲究、慈母般的老太太放下手里的针线活，从床边扶手椅里站了起来。","He uttered these words in a feeble voice, being very faint and weak; but they were overheard at once.The curtain at the bed’s head was hastily drawn back, and a motherly old lady, very neatly and precisely dressed, rose as she undrew it, from an arm-chair close by, in which she had been sitting at needle-work."
"“别出声，我亲爱的孩子，”老太太温柔地说道，“你可得先安心养病，要不然这病又得加重。你病得可不轻——别提有多厉害了。还是先躺下吧，真是个好孩子！”老太太一边说着，一边轻轻地把奥利弗的头搁到枕头上，将他额前的头发向后拨了拨，她注视着奥利弗的脸，目光是那么慈祥、那么仁爱。他忍不住把自己瘦弱的小手放进她的手里，把她的手拉过来环住自己的脖子。","“Hush, my dear,” said the old lady softly.“You must be very quiet, or you will be ill again; and you have been very bad,—as bad as bad could be, pretty nigh.Lie down again; there’s a dear!”With those words, the old lady very gently placed Oliver’s head upon the pillow; and, smoothing back his hair from his forehead, looked so kindly and loving in his face, that he could not help placing his little withered hand in hers, and drawing it round his neck."
"“天哪！”老太太热泪盈眶地说，“真是个知恩图报的小家伙。可爱的小东西！要是他母亲能够像我一样坐在他身边，看见他现在的样子，该多开心啊！”","“Save us!” said the old lady, with tears in her eyes.“What a grateful little dear it is.Pretty creetur!What would his mother feel if she had sat by him as I have, and could see him now!”"
"“说不定她真的能够看见我呢，”小奥利弗双手合十，低声说道，“也许她就坐在我身边呢。我几乎能感觉到。”","“Perhaps she does see me,” whispered Oliver , folding his hands together; “perhaps she has sat by me.I almost feel as if she had.”"
"“那是因为你在发烧，我亲爱的孩子。”老太太和善地说。","“That was the fever, my dear,” said the old lady mildly."
"“我想也是，”小奥利弗回答道，“天堂离这儿太远了，他们在那儿那么幸福，是不会来一个苦孩子的床边的。不过要是妈妈知道我病了，即使她在天堂，也会惦记我的。因为她临死的时候就病得很厉害。她一定一点也不知道我现在的情形，”奥利弗停了一会儿继续说，“如果她看见我受伤，她一定会伤心死的。而现在每次我做梦见到她，她看起来都是那么快乐。”","“I suppose it was,” replied Oliver, “because heaven is a long way off; and they are too happy there, to come down to the bedside of a poor boy.But if she knew I was ill, she must have pitied me, even there; for she was very ill herself before she died.She can’t know anything about me though,” added Oliver after a moment’s silence.“If she had seen me hurt, it would have made her sorrowful; and her face has always looked sweet and happy, when I have dreamed of her.”"
"老太太沉默了。她先擦了擦自己的眼睛，然后又擦了一下放在床罩上的眼镜，彷佛眼镜也是脸上重要的部分似的。她取来些冷饮给奥利弗喝，然后轻轻拍了拍他的脸颊，告诉他他必须安静躺下休息，否则又会生病了。","The old lady made no reply to this; but wiping her eyes first, and her spectacles, which lay on the counterpane, afterwards, as if they were part and parcel of those features, brought some cool stuff for Oliver to drink; and then, patting him on the cheek, told him he must lie very quiet, or he would be ill again."
"于是奥利弗就安静地躺下了，一方面因为他乐意听从这位慈爱的老太太的话，另一方面，说真的，刚才说了那么多话，他早已经累得没有力气了。没过一会儿他就微微打起盹来，直到一支燃着的蜡烛靠近了床边，他才醒过来。烛光映照下，一位绅士拿着一只滴答作响的大号金表，号了号他的脉，说他已经好多了。","So, Oliver kept very still; partly because he was anxious to obey the kind old lady in all things; and partly, to tell the truth, because he was completely exhausted with what he had already said.He soon fell into a gentle doze, from which he was awakened by the light of a candle: which, being brought near the bed, showed him a gentleman with a very large and loud-ticking gold watch in his hand, who felt his pulse, and said he was a great deal better."
"“亲爱的孩子，你感觉好多了，是吧？”这位绅士问。","“You are a great deal better, are you not, my dear?” said the gentleman."
"“是的，先生，谢谢你。”奥利弗答道。","“Yes, thank you, sir,” replied Oliver."
"“嗯，我就知道，”绅士说，“你一定饿坏了吧？”","“Yes, I know you are,” said the gentleman: “You’re hungry too, an’t you?”"
"“我不饿，先生。”奥利弗又答。","“No, sir,” answered Oliver."
"“唔！”绅士说，“我知道你还没感觉到饿。贝德温太太，他现在还不饿。”这位绅士看上去十分渊博。","“Hem!” said the gentleman.“No, I know you’re not.He is not hungry, Mrs. Bedwin,” said the gentleman: looking very wise."
"老太太很恭敬地点了点头，似乎是在夸赞医生知识渊博。医生本人看来也有同感。","The old lady made a respectful inclination of the head, which seemed to say that she thought the doctor was a very clever man.The doctor appeared much of the same opinion himself."
"“我亲爱的孩子，你还是很困，是吗？”医生又问道。","“You feel sleepy, don’t you, my dear?” said the doctor."
"“不，先生。”奥利弗说。","“No, sir,” replied Oliver."
"“不困了，”医生显出一副心中有数的满意神情，“不想再睡了，也不口渴，对吗？”","“No,” said the doctor, with a very shrewd and satisfied look.“You’re not sleepy.Nor thirsty.Are you?”"
"“不，先生，我很渴．”奥利弗回答。","“Yes, sir, rather thirsty,” answered Oliver."
"“跟我估计的一样，贝德温太太。”医生说道，“感到口渴是很正常的。你给他点茶，加一点干面包，不要抹黄油。别让他太热了，太太，但也要注意别让他太冷。你能做到吧？”","“Just as I expected, Mrs. Bedwin,” said the doctor.“It’s very natural that he should be thirsty.You may give him a little tea, ma’am, and some dry toast without any butter.Don’t keep him too warm, ma’am; but be careful that you don’t let him be too cold; will you have the goodness?”"
"老太太行了个屈膝礼。医生试了试冷饮，表示认可，便匆匆离去了。下楼的时候，他的靴子吱嘎作响，俨然一副权贵派头。","The old lady dropped a curtsey.The doctor, after tasting the cool stuff, and expressing a qualified approval of it, hurried away: his boots creaking in a very important and wealthy manner as he went downstairs."
"过了一会儿，奥利弗又迷迷糊糊睡着了。他再次醒来的时候，已经快十二点了。贝德温太太不久后温和地跟他道了声晚安，把他交给一位刚来的胖老太婆照顾。老太婆随身带着一个小包袱，里面放着一本不大的祈祷书和一顶大睡帽。老太婆戴上了睡帽，将祈祷书放在了桌子上，告诉奥利弗，自己是来陪他过夜的。她把椅子移近壁炉，便接连打起盹来。她不时向前跌倒醒来，嘴里发出各种声音，还时不时透不过气来。不过，这些最多也就是让她使劲揉揉鼻子，又陷入沉睡。","Oliver dozed off again, soon after this; when he awoke, it was nearly twelve o’clock.The old lady tenderly bade him good-night shortly afterwards, and left him in charge of a fat old woman who had just come: bringing with her, in a little bundle, a small Prayer Book and a large nightcap.Putting the latter on her head and the former on the table, the old woman, after telling Oliver that she had come to sit up with him, drew her chair close to the fire and went off into a series of short naps, chequered at frequent intervals with sundry tumblings forward, and divers moans and chokings.These, however, had no worse effect than causing her to rub her nose very hard, and then fall asleep again."
"就这样，长夜慢慢过去了。好些时候，奥利弗都是醒着的。他躺在床上，时而数一数灯芯草蜡烛罩子投射到天花板上的小光圈，时而又睡眼朦胧地打量着墙上复杂的壁纸图案。屋子里黑暗而又寂静，显得庄严肃穆。这些不禁使这个孩子想到，无数个日日夜夜以来，死神一直在这里徘徊，在每处可能都已经留下了它阴森恐怖的痕迹。想到这儿，奥利弗转过脸，把脑袋埋在枕头里，虔诚地向上帝祈祷。","And thus the night crept slowly on.Oliver lay awake for some time, counting the little circles of light which the reflection of the rushlight-shade threw upon the ceiling; or tracing with his languid eyes the intricate pattern of the paper on the wall.The darkness and the deep stillness of the room were very solemn; as they brought into the boy’s mind the thought that death had been hovering there, for many days and nights, and might yet fill it with the gloom and dread of his awful presence, he turned his face upon the pillow, and fervently prayed to Heaven."
"渐渐地，他进入了梦乡。这种安宁只有大病初愈的人才能体会，让人久久不愿醒来。即使这就是死亡，又有谁愿意被唤醒，来继续面对挣扎混乱的人生，无数的近忧远虑，还有那些不堪回首的往事！","Gradually, he fell into that deep tranquil sleep which ease from recent suffering alone imparts; that calm and peaceful rest which it is pain to wake from.Who, if this were death, would be roused again to all the struggles and turmoils of life; to all its cares for the present; its anxieties for the future; more than all, its weary recollections of the past!"
"奥利弗再次睁开眼睛的时候，太阳已经很高了。他感到心情舒畅，幸福万分。他终于安然度过了这场大病的危险期。他再次回到了世间。","It had been bright day, for hours, when Oliver opened his eyes; he felt cheerful and happy.The crisis of the disease was safely past.He belonged to the world again."
"接下来的三天，他已经可以坐在安乐椅里，舒舒坦坦地靠在枕头上了。他的身体依旧很虚弱，不能行走。贝德温太太把他带到楼下的房间里，这个小房间是属于她这位女管家的。善良的老太太把他安顿在壁炉边上，自己也坐了下来。看到奥利弗身体好多了，她十分高兴，突然大哭起来。","In three days’ time he was able to sit in an easy-chair, well propped up with pillows; and, as he was still too weak to walk, Mrs. Bedwin had him carried downstairs into the little housekeeper’s room, which belonged to her.Having him set, here, by the fire-side, the good old lady sat herself down too; and, being in a state of considerable delight at seeing him so much better, forthwith began to cry most violently."
"“别介意，我亲爱的孩子，”老太太说，“我是因为欢喜才哭的，这是常有的事。你看，现在没事了，我感觉好多了。”","“Never mind me, my dear,” said the old lady; “I’m only having a regular good cry.There; it’s all over now; and I’m quite comfortable.”"
"“你对我真是太好了，太太。”奥利弗说。","“You’re very, very kind to me, ma’am,” said Oliver."
"“你可千万别客气，我亲爱的孩子，”老太太说道，“还是来喝点肉汤吧，是该喝汤的时候了。医生说布朗洛先生今天上午可能要来看你，咱们得好好准备一下。因为你气色越好，他就会越高兴。”说着，老太太在一口小炖锅里热了满满一盆肉汤。好浓的肉汤啊！奥利弗心里想，要是稀释成规定的浓度，这少说也应该够三百五十个贫民饱餐一顿了。","“Well, never you mind that, my dear,” said the old lady; “that’s got nothing to do with your broth; and it’s full time you had it; for the doctor says Mr. Brownlow may come in to see you this morning; and we must get up our best looks, because the better we look, the more he’ll be pleased.”And with this, the old lady applied herself to warming up, in a little saucepan, a basin full of broth: strong enough, Oliver thought, to furnish an ample dinner, when reduced to the regulation strength, for three hundred and fifty paupers, at the lowest computation."
"“亲爱的，你喜欢图画吗？”老太太见奥利弗目不转睛地盯着墙上的一幅肖像画看，便问道。","“Are you fond of pictures, dear?” inquired the old lady, seeing that Oliver had fixed his eyes, most intently, on a portrait which hung against the wall; just opposite his chair."
"“我基本上不懂，太太。”奥利弗回答道，目光并没有离开那张画，“我一共也没见过几张画，所以什么都不懂。画上的这位太太可真是又漂亮又温柔啊！”","“I don’t quite know, ma’am,” said Oliver, without taking his eyes from the canvas; “I have seen so few that I hardly know.What a beautiful, mild face that lady’s is!”"
"“啊！”老太太说，“亲爱的孩子，画家们总是把女士们画得比她们本人漂亮。要不然，就找不到买家啦。发明照相机的人可能早知道这一招根本行不通吧。这买卖太诚实了。”老太太认为自己的想法妙极了，开心地笑了起来。","“Ah!” said the old lady, “painters always make ladies out prettier than they are, or they wouldn’t get any custom, child.The man that invented the machine for taking likenesses might have known that would never succeed; it’s a deal too honest. A deal,” said the old lady, laughing very heartily at her own acuteness."
"“那——这是不是一张画像，太太？”奥利弗问。","“Is—is that a likeness, ma’am?” said Oliver."
"“是的，”老太太目光离开了肉汤，抬起头来看了一会儿，说道，“这是一张肖像画．”","“Yes,” said the old lady, looking up for a moment from the broth; “that’s a portrait.”"
"“太太，她是谁呢？”奥利弗问道。","“Whose, ma’am?” asked Oliver."
"“哦，说实话，我亲爱的孩子，我也不知道，”老太太好脾气地说，“我猜咱们都不认识她。你好像很喜欢这幅画，亲爱的。”","“Why, really, my dear, I don’t know,” answered the old lady in a good-humoured manner.“It’s not a likeness of anybody that you or I know, I expect.It seems to strike your fancy, dear.”"
"“她太美了。”奥利弗应道。","“It is so pretty,” replied Oliver."
"“哎呀，你确定自己没被它吓着吗？”老太太注意到奥利弗注视着画像时那一脸敬畏的神情，大为吃惊，赶紧询问。","“Why, sure you' re not afraid of it?” said the old lady: observing in great surprise, the look of awe with which the child regarded the painting."
"“哦，没有，没有，”奥利弗赶紧回答，“只是那双眼睛看起来太悲伤了。无论我坐在哪儿，它们都像在盯着我。这让我心跳得厉害。”奥利弗又小声补充道，“这画像就像活的一样，似乎想跟我说话，只是说不出来。”","“Oh no, no,” returned Oliver quickly; “but the eyes look so sorrowful; and where I sit, they seem fixed upon me.It makes my heart beat,” added Oliver in a low voice, “as if it was alive, and wanted to speak to me, but couldn’t.”"
"“上帝保佑！”老太太叫着站起来，“我亲爱的好孩子，快别那么说。你病刚好，身体还很虚弱，难免会紧张。来，我给你把椅子推到另一边去，你就看不见它了。行啦！”老太太边说着，边把椅子推开，“无论如何，你现在看不见它了吧。”","“Lord save us!” exclaimed the old lady, starting; “don’t talk in that way, child.You’re weak and nervous after your illness.Let me wheel your chair round to the other side; and then you won’t see it.There!” said the old lady, suiting the action to the word; “you don’t see it now, at all events.”"
"可是，那幅画就像是印在奥利弗的心中一样，依旧是那么清晰真切，彷佛他丝毫没有移动位置一般。他想最好还是别再让这位善良的太太操心了，所以当太太打量他的时候，他温和地笑了笑。贝德温太太看到他感觉好些了，这才放心。她往肉汤里放了些盐，又掰碎了几片烤面包加了进去，忙活了好一阵，完成了隆重的准备工作。奥利弗快速把汤喝完了。他刚喝完最后一口，就传来了轻轻的敲门声。“请进。”老太太说道。进来的是布朗洛先生。","Oliver did see it in his mind’s eye as distinctly as if he had not altered his position; but he thought it better not to worry the kind old lady; so he smiled gently when she looked at him; and Mrs. Bedwin, satisfied that he felt more comfortable, salted and broke bits of toasted bread into the broth, with all the bustle befitting so solemn a preparation.Oliver got through it with extraordinary expedition.He had scarcely swallowed the last spoonful, when there came a soft rap at the door.“Come in,” said the old lady; and in walked Mr. Brownlow."
"喏，老先生步履轻快地走了进来。他把眼镜支到额头上，双手插到长袍后摆里，刚开始认真打量起奥利弗，脸上就出现了各种奇怪的表情。奥利弗由于大病一场的缘故，显得格外疲惫憔悴。出于对恩人的尊敬，他努力试图站起来，但没成功，又重新跌坐到椅子上。事实上，如果真要说的话，布朗洛先生的心胸之宽广，抵得上六个一般心地善良的老绅士。他的心通过某种压力程序将两汪热泪送进他的眼眶，我们在哲学方面对此还真是掌握得不够，尚无法解释。","Now, the old gentleman came in as brisk as need be; but, he had no sooner raised his spectacles on his forehead, and thrust his hands behind the skirts of his dressing-gown to take a good long look at Oliver, than his countenance underwent a very great variety of odd contortions.Oliver looked very worn and shadowy from sickness, and made an ineffectual attempt to stand up, out of respect to his benefactor, which terminated in his sinking back into the chair again;and the fact is, if the truth must be told, that Mr. Brownlow’s heart, being large enough for any six ordinary old gentlemen of humane disposition, forced a supply of tears into his eyes, by some hydraulic process which we are not sufficiently philosophical to be in a condition to explain."
"“可怜的孩子，可怜的孩子！”布朗洛先生清了清喉咙说，“贝德温太太，我今天早上声音有些沙哑。恐怕我是感冒了。”","“Poor boy, poor boy!” said Mr. Brownlow, clearing his throat.“I’m rather hoarse this morning, Mrs. Bedwin.I’m afraid I have caught cold.”"
"“但愿不是，先生。”贝德温太太说道，“你所有的衣物都是晒过的。”","“I hope not, sir,” said Mrs. Bedwin.“Everything you have had, has been well aired, sir.”"
"“我不知道，贝德温。我也不知道怎么搞的，”布朗洛先生说道，“可能是昨天吃晚饭的时候用的餐巾有点潮，不过没有关系。亲爱的，你感觉怎么样？”","“I don’t know, Bedwin.I don’t know,” said Mr. Brownlow; “I rather think I had a damp napkin at dinner-time yesterday; but never mind that.How do you feel, my dear?”"
"“很开心，先生。”奥利弗回答，“真是太感谢您了。您对我太好了。”","“Very happy, sir,” replied Oliver.“And very grateful indeed, sir, for your goodness to me.”"
"“真是个好孩子，”布朗洛先生斩钉截铁地说，“你给他用补品了吗，贝德温？哪怕是流质的，嗯？”","“Good boy,” said Mr. Brownlow, stoutly.“Have you given him any nourishment, Bedwin?Any slops, eh?”"
"“他刚喝了一碗浓浓的美味肉汤，先生。”贝德温太太微微欠身，特意强调了一下最后一个词，暗示一般的流质和精心熬制的浓汤还是有所不同的。","“He has just had a basin of beautiful strong broth, sir,” replied Mrs. Bedwin: drawing herself up slightly, and laying strong emphasis on the last word: to intimate that between slops, and broth will compounded, there existed no affinity or connection whatsoever."
"“啊！”布朗洛先生微微抖了一下，说道，“喝两杯葡萄酒可能对他更有益。是不是，汤姆·怀特，嗯？”","“Ugh!” said Mr. Brownlow, with a slight shudder; “a couple of glasses of port wine would have done him a great deal more good.Wouldn’t they, Tom White, eh?”"
"“先生，我叫奥利弗。”小病人相当吃惊地回答道。","“My name is Oliver, sir,” replied the little invalid: with a look of great astonishment."
"“奥利弗？”布朗洛先生又问，“奥利弗什么？是叫奥利弗·怀特吗？”","“Oliver,” said Mr. Brownlow; “Oliver what?Oliver White, eh?”"
"“不，先生。是特威斯特，奥利弗·特威斯特。”","“No, sir, Twist, Oliver Twist.”"
"“好奇怪的名字！”老先生说道，“那你怎么告诉治安官你叫怀特呢？”","“Queer name!” said the old gentleman.“What made you tell the magistrate your name was White?”"
"“我从来没有对他说过，先生。”奥利弗吃惊地回答。","“I never told him so, sir,” returned Oliver in amazement."
"这话听上去像在撒谎，老先生有些严厉地盯着奥利弗的脸。他无法让人产生怀疑，他那瘦骨嶙峋的脸上似乎处处都写着诚实。","This sounded so like a falsehood, that the old gentleman looked somewhat sternly in Oliver’s face.It was impossible to doubt him; there was truth in every one of its thin and sharpened lineaments."
"“一定是搞错了。”布朗洛先生说。尽管让他盯着奥利弗的动机已经不存在了，但是那个旧念头又回到老先生的脑海中，他觉得奥利弗的脸与某张熟悉的面孔太相似了。这个念头如此强烈，以至于他根本无法将眼光从奥利弗脸上移开。","“Some mistake,” said Mr. Brownlow.But, although his motive for looking steadily at Oliver no longer existed, the old idea of the resemblance between his features and some familiar face came upon him so strongly, that he could not withdraw his gaze."
"“先生，求你不要生我的气，好吗？”奥利弗抬起双眼，恳求地说。","“I hope you are not angry with me, sir?” said Oliver, raising his eyes beseechingly."
"“没有，没有。”老先生答道。“嗨！这是什么？贝德温，你瞧那画！”","“No, no,” replied the old gentleman.“Why! what’s this?Bedwin, look there!”"
"他边说边急速地指指奥利弗头顶上的肖像画，又指指小奥利弗的脸。奥利弗的长相简直就是那幅肖像的翻版。那双眼睛、那头型、那嘴，每部分都是一模一样。那一瞬间的神态是如此逼真，彷佛就连最细微的线条都以惊人的准确手法临摹了下来。","As he spoke, he pointed hastily to the picture over Oliver’s head, and then to the boy’s face.There was its living copy.The eyes, the head, the mouth; every feature was the same.The expression was, for the instant, so precisely alike, that the minutest line seemed copied with startling accuracy!"
"奥利弗不清楚是什么引来了这突如其来的叫声；他的身体尚未恢复，还不能够承受如此大的惊吓，他再次昏了过去。他这一晕，正好给了笔者一个机会，来讲讲那位快乐的老先生的两个小门徒，以解答读者的疑问。事情是这样的——当时，机灵鬼和他的那位技艺精湛的朋友贝茨少爷偷了布朗洛先生的私人财物，结果引发了那场对奥利弗的追捕，他们两个也大喊大叫地加入了这场追捕。这些前边已经叙述过了。他们之所以这样做，是基于一种得体而又令人称赞的考虑，那就是只顾自己。鉴于国民民主与个人自由是每一个纯正的英国人最引以为豪的东西，那么，我就无需提醒读者注意，他们的这一行为自然会大大提高他们在公众以及所有爱国人士心目中的地位。他们只顾保全自己安危的这一铁证，足以证明这部由那些深谋远虑、博古通今的哲学家制定的小法典的适用性，该法典被视为一切本能行为的主要动机。这些哲学家是相当精明的，他们将一切本能行为归纳为格言和理论，又对本性的智慧和悟性做了一番简略而又巧妙的恭维，把良心、宽厚以及感情上的考虑全都抛得无影无踪。这些东西当然不能与本性相提并论，毕竟人们所公认的是，本性比人所难免具有的种种缺点瑕疵要高尚得多。","Oliver knew not the cause of this sudden exclamation; for, not being strong enough to bear the start it gave him, he fainted away.A weakness on his part, which affords the narrative an opportunity of relieving the reader from suspense, in behalf of the two young pupils of the Merry Old Gentleman; and of recording— That when the Dodger, and his accomplished friend Master Bates, joined in the hue-and-cry which was raised at Oliver’s heels, in consequence of their executing an illegal conveyance of Mr. Brownlow’s personal property, as has been already described, they were actuated by a very laudable and becoming regard for themselves;and forasmuch as the freedom of the subject and the liberty of the individual are among the first and proudest boasts of a true-hearted Englishman, so, I need hardly beg the reader to observe, that this action should tend to exalt them in the opinion of all public and patriotic men, in almost as great a degree as this strong proof of their anxiety for their own preservation and safety goes to corroborate and confirm the little code of laws which certain profound and sound-judging philosophers have laid down as the main-springs of all Nature’s deeds and actions:the said philosophers very wisely reducing the good lady’s proceedings to matters of maxim and theory: and, by a very neat and pretty compliment to her exalted wisdom and understanding, putting entirely out of sight any considerations of heart, or generous impulse and feeling.For, these are matters totally beneath a female who is acknowledged by universal admission to be far above the numerous little foibles and weaknesses of her sex."
"倘若需要进一步证明这两位处于微妙窘境的小绅士在本性方面的哲理，笔者可以随手就举出他们退出追捕这个事实（这个前面也已经提到）：当人群的注意力全部集中在奥利弗身上时，他们便立刻抄最近的路溜回了家。尽管，我并不打算断言，抄近路也是那些声名显赫、博学多才的哲人得出伟大结论的常见作风（他们的路程确实因委婉曲折的叙述、散漫交错的安排而被拉长，就如同那些有一肚子想法的醉汉，一开口就口若悬河一样）；但是，我的确想明确地指出，许多大哲学家在实施他们的理论时，在排除一切可能对他们不利的偶然因素时，都无一例外地显示出聪明才智、深谋远虑。因此，为了成大事，就得不拘小节。只要能达到目的，任何手段都无可非议。是对，还是错，抑或两者之间的区别到底是什么，统统都是由哲学家说了算的。哲学家完全是根据自己所处的特殊情况，作出清晰、全面、公正的判断。","If I wanted any further proof of the strictly philosophical nature of the conduct of these young gentlemen in their very delicate predicament, I should at once find it in the fact (also recorded in a foregoing part of this narrative), of their quitting the pursuit, when the general attention was fixed upon Oliver; and making immediately for their home by the shortest possible cut.Although I do not mean to assert that it is usually the practice of renowned and learned sages, to shorten the road to any great conclusion (their course indeed being rather to lengthen the distance, by various circumlocutions and discursive staggerings, like unto those in which drunken men under the pressure of a too mighty flow of ideas, are prone to indulge);still, I do mean to say, and do say distinctly, that it is the invariable practice of many mighty philosophers, in carrying out their theories, to evince great wisdom and foresight in providing against every possible contingency which can be supposed at all likely to affect themselves.Thus, to do a great right, you may do a little wrong; and you may take any means which the end to be attained, will justify; the amount of the right, or the amount of the wrong, or indeed the distinction between the two, being left entirely to the philosopher concerned, to be settled and determined by his clear, comprehensive, and impartial view of his own particular case."
"两个小绅士迅速跑掉了，穿过如迷宫般错综复杂的街道和院落，一直跑到一个低矮昏暗的拱道，才冒险在那里歇了歇。两人在那儿沉默了一会儿。缓过气后，贝茨少爷便发出一声喜悦的感慨，接着就控制不住地大笑起来，他倒在了门阶上，笑得直打滚。","It was not until the two boys had scoured, with great rapidity, through a most intricate maze of narrow streets and courts, that they ventured to halt beneath a low and dark archway.Having remained silent here, just long enough to recover breath to speak, Master Bates uttered an exclamation of amusement and delight; and, bursting into an uncontrollable fit of laughter, flung himself upon a doorstep, and rolled thereon in a transport of mirth."
"“笑什么呢？”机灵鬼问。","“What’s the matter?” inquired the Dodger."
"“哈哈哈！”贝茨放声大笑。","“Ha! ha! ha!” roared Charley Bates."
"“快别笑了，”机灵鬼小心地环视了一圈，劝道，“你这个笨蛋，你想被抓到吗？”","“Hold your noise,” remonstrated the Dodger, looking cautiously round.“Do you want to be grabbed, stupid?”"
"“我忍不住，”查利说，“我忍不住！他拼命地跑，一溜烟地转过街角，又撞到了电线杆子上，爬起来继续跑，就像他跟电线杆子一样都是铁做的。再看看我，抹嘴儿插在口袋里，大喊大叫地在后面追他。——天哪！”贝茨少爷想象力极其丰富，将刚才的场景添油加醋地展现出来。说到这儿，他又在门阶上滚起来，笑得更欢了。","“I can’t help it,” said Charley, “I can’t help it!To see him splitting away at that pace, and cutting round the corners, and knocking up again the posts, and starting on again as if he was made of iron as well as them, and me with the wipe in my pocket, singing out arter him—oh, my eye!”The vivid imagination of Master Bates presented the scene before him in too strong colours.As he arrived at this apostrophe, he again rolled upon the door-step, and laughed louder than before."
"“费金会说什么？”机灵鬼趁着伙伴停下来喘气的时候问。","“What’s ll Fagin say?” inquired the Dodger; taking advantage of the next interval of breathlessness on the part of his friend to propound the question."
"“说什么？”贝茨重复道。","“What?” repeated Charley Bates."
"“是啊，他会说什么？”机灵鬼问。","“Ah, what?” said the Dodger."
"“咳，他会说什么呢？”查利见机灵鬼不是说着玩的态度，顿时也欢喜不起来了。“他会说什么呢？”","“Why, what should he say?” inquired Charley: stopping rather suddenly in his merriment; for the Dodger’s manner was impressive.“What should he say?”"
"道金斯先生吹了会儿口哨，摘下了帽子，挠了挠头，脑袋点了三下。","Mr. Dawkins whistled for a couple of minutes; then, taking off his hat, scratched his head, and nodded thrice."
"“这是什么意思？”查利·贝茨问。","“What do you mean?” said Charley."
"“吐噜啰噜，腌猪腿烧菠菜，他不会是青蛙。”机灵鬼聪明的脸上挂着一丝嘲笑。","“Toor rul lol loo, gammon and spinnage, the frog he wouldn’t, and high cockolorum,” said the Dodger: with a slight sneer on his intellectual countenance."
"这就是解释，但是并不令人满意。贝茨少爷也这么觉得，便问：“你这是什么意思？”","This was explanatory, but not satisfactory.Master Bates felt it so; and again said, “What do you mean?”"
"机灵鬼没有回答。只是又戴上了他的帽子，把长长的外套下摆塞到了胳膊底下，用舌头顶了顶腮帮子，亲昵且意味深长地用手在鼻梁上拍了五六下，最后转身溜进了院子。贝茨少爷若有所思地跟了上去。","The Dodger made no reply; but putting his hat on again, and gathering the skirts of his long-tailed coat under his arm, thrust his tongue into his cheek, slapped the bridge of his nose some half-dozen times in a familiar but expressive manner, and turning on his heel, slunk down the court.Master Bates followed, with a thoughtful countenance."
"这场交谈过去几分钟后，那位快活的老绅士听到楼梯上响起吱嘎作响的脚步声，不由一惊。此刻他正坐在壁炉旁，一手拿着干腊肠和一小条面包，另一只手拿着小刀。面前的三角架上搁着一只白镴锅。他回头，苍白的脸上露出无赖的笑容。他从深红色的眉毛底下盯着外面，耳朵贴着门，认真听着。","The noise of footsteps on the creaking stairs, a few minutes after the occurrence of this conversation, roused the merry old gentleman as he sat over the fire with a saveloy and a small loaf in his hand; a pocket-knife in his right; and a pewter pot on the trivet.There was a rascally smile on his white face as he turned round, and looking sharply out from under his thick red eyebrows, bent his ear towards the door, and listened."
"“喂，怎么回事？”犹太佬的脸色变了，自言自语道，“怎么只回来了两个？另一个呢？他们应该不会惹出了什么事情吧。听听！”","“Why, how’s this?” muttered the Jew: changing countenance; “only two of ’em?Where’s the third?They can’t have got into trouble.Hark!”"
"脚步声越来越近，最后到了楼梯口。房门被缓缓地推开了。机灵鬼和查利·贝茨走了进来，又把门在身后关上了。","The footsteps approached nearer; they reached the landing.The door was slowly opened; and the Dodger and Charley Bates entered, closing it behind them."
"第十三章 向聪明的读者介绍几位新朋友以及他们与本故事有关的各种趣事","CHAPTER XIII Some new acquaintances are introduced to the intelligent reader, connected with whom various pleasant matters are related, appertaining to this history "
"“奥利弗哪儿去了？”犹太佬一脸杀气地吼道，“那个小子在哪儿？”","“Where’s Oliver?” said the Jew, rising with a menacing look.“Where’s the boy?”"
"两个小扒手望着他们的师傅，像是被他的暴怒吓得胆战心惊，忐忑不安地看着彼此。但是他们没有回答。","The young thieves eyed their preceptor as if they were alarmed at his violence; and looked uneasily at each other.But they made no reply."
"“那孩子出什么事了？”犹太佬一把紧紧揪起机灵鬼的衣领，用令人毛骨悚然的诅咒恐吓他说，“快说，不然我掐死你！”","“What’s become of the boy?” said the Jew, seizing the Dodger tightly by the collar, and threatening him with horrid imprecations.“Speak out, or I’ll throttle you!”"
"费金先生的神情是如此严肃认真，以至于查利·贝茨这个一向认为不论出了什么情况，明哲保身都是上上策的孩子，估计第二个被掐死的一定会是自己，便立刻跪倒在地上，发出一阵洪亮且持久的嚎叫，就像发疯的公牛的叫声，又像是从喇叭里发出的声音。","Mr. Fagin looked so very much in earnest, that Charley Bates, who deemed it prudent in all cases to be on the safe side, and who conceived it by no means improbable that it might be his turn to be throttled second, dropped upon his knees, and raised a loud, well-sustained, and continuous roar—something between a mad bull and a speaking trumpet."
"“你说不说？”犹太佬咆哮道。他使劲地摇着机灵鬼，没把他从那件宽大的外套里抖出来，真是个奇迹。","“Will you speak?” thundered the Jew: shaking the Dodger so much that his keeping in the big coat at all, seemed perfectly miraculous."
"“嗯，他给逮住了，就是这么回事。”机灵鬼沮丧地说，“喂，你放开我，放开！”机灵鬼晃了晃身体，猛地从肥大的外套中挣脱了出来，只把外套留在了犹太佬手里。机灵鬼抓起烤面包的叉子，冲着这位快活老绅士的背心就是一下。要是叉中的话，估计老绅士一时半会儿真恢复不过来，到时候得损失不少乐子。","“Why, the traps have got him, and that’s all about it,” said the Dodger, sullenly.“Come, let go o’ me, will you!”And, swinging himself, at one jerk, clean out of the big coat, which he left in the Jew’s hands, the Dodger snatched up the toasting fork, and made a pass at the merry old gentleman’s waistcoat; which, if it had taken effect, would have let a little more merriment out than could have been easily replaced."
"尽管犹太佬看起来年迈不堪，但他在这千钧一发之际，却敏捷地退后了一步，动作之敏捷让人难以想象。他抓起那口锅，随时准备砸向攻击者的脑袋。就在这时，查利·贝茨大叫一声，叫声极其骇人，岔开了他的注意力，他突然改变了方向，将锅朝那个小绅士砸去。","The Jew stepped back in this emergency, with more agility than could have been anticipated in a man of his apparent decrepitude; and, seizing up the pot, prepared to hurl it at his assailant’s head.But Charley Bates, at this moment, calling his attention by a perfectly terrific howl, he suddenly altered its destination, and flung it full at that young gentleman."
"“哎呦！这到底是怎么回事！”一个低沉的声音怒吼道，“是谁把这泼到我身上的？还好砸到我的是啤酒，不是那口锅，否则有他好看的。我就知道，像这样能随便泼得起饮料的也只有这位无法无天、坐地分赃的混账老犹太财主了。其他人也就能泼泼水——还得每季度骗骗自来水公司才成。费金，这到底是怎么回事啊？妈的，要是我的围巾上沾的不是啤酒的话！快进来！你这个偷偷摸摸的杂种，你呆在外面干什么？莫非还为你家主人害臊！进来！”","“Why, what the blazes is in the wind now!” growled a deep voice.“Who pitched that’ ere at me? it’s well it’s the beer, and not the pot, as hit me, or I’d have settled somebody.I might have know’d, as nobody but an infernal, rich, plundering, thundering old Jew could afford to throw away any drink but water—and not that, unless he done the River Company every quarter.What’s it all about, Fagin?D—me, if my neck-handkercher an’t lined with beer!Come in, you sneaking warmint; wot are you stopping outside for, as if you was ashamed of your master!Come in!”"
"吼出这一通的是一个大约三十五六岁的汉子。他长得很结实，穿着一件黑色的棉绒外套，一条脏兮兮的黄褐色马裤，系带半长筒靴里面穿着灰色的棉袜，裹着两条大粗腿，腿肚子上肉嘟嘟的——这样的大腿在这种装束的衬托下显得格外滑稽，就像一幅尚未完成的工艺品，独独缺一副脚镣作为装饰。他带着一顶棕色帽子，脖子上裹着一条脏兮兮的染色围巾。他一边说话，一边用长长的、末端已经磨损的围巾角擦拭脸上的啤酒。擦完后，那张呆板的、三天没刮胡子的大宽脸就露了出来，眼中流露出杀气；有一只眼睛周围颜色不太一样，什么颜色都有，那是最近挨了一拳留下的痕迹。","The man who growled out these words, was a stoutly-built fellow of about five-and-thirty, in a black velveteen coat, very soiled drab breeches, lace-up half boots, and grey cotton stockings which inclosed a bulky pair of legs, with large swelling calves;—the kind of legs, which in such costume, always look in an unfinished and incomplete state without a set of fetters to garnish them.He had a brown hat on his head, and a dirty belcher handkerchief round his neck: with the long frayed ends of which he smeared the beer from his face as he spoke.He disclosed, when he had done so, a broad heavy countenance with a beard of three days’ growth, and two scowling eyes; one of which displayed various parti-coloured symptoms of having been recently damaged by a blow."
"“进来，你听见没有？”这个引人注目的凶神吼道。","“Come in, d’ye hear?” growled this engaging ruffian."
"一只毛茸茸的白狗躲躲闪闪地跑了进来，脸上大概带着二十多处抓痕跟伤口。","A white shaggy dog, with his face scratched and torn in twenty different places, skulked into the room."
"“你先前干吗不进来？”汉子说道，“你太骄傲了，当着大伙的面连我都不认了，是不是？趴下！”","“Why didn’ you come in afore?” said the man.“You’re getting too proud to own me afore company, are you?Lie down!”"
"这道命令伴随着狠狠的一脚，把那畜生打发到角落里去了。显然，那狗对此已经习以为常了。它静静在角落里缩成一团，一声不吭，一双贼眼一分钟大概眨巴了二十下，似乎是在打量这个屋子。","This command was accompanied with a kick, which sent the animal to the other end of the room.He appeared well used to it, however; for he coiled himself up in a corner very quietly, without uttering a sound, and winking his very ill-looking eyes twenty times in a minute, appeared to occupy himself in taking a survey of the apartment."
"“你在干什么？在虐待这些孩子吗？你这个贪求无厌、永——不——满——足的老守财奴！”汉子说着，不慌不忙地坐了下来。“我就纳闷，他们怎么不杀了你！我要是他们就这么干了。我要是你的徒弟，早就把你杀了。哦——不，把你杀了的话你就卖不出去了。我看你除了能装在玻璃瓶里当个奇丑无比的稀罕物，也就一文不值了。不过我想他们找不到这么大的玻璃瓶子。”","“What are you up to?Ill-treating the boys, you covetous, avaricious, in-sa-ti-a-ble old fence?” said the man, seating himself deliberately.“I wonder they don’t murder you!I would if I was them.If I’d been your ’prentice, I’d have done it long ago, and—no, I couldn’t have sold you afterwards, for you’re fit for nothing but keeping as a curiousity of ugliness in a glass bottle, and I suppose they don’t blow glass bottles large enough.”"
"“嘘！嘘！赛克斯先生，”犹太佬打着哆嗦说，“别说得那么大声。”","“Hush! hush! Mr. Sikes,” said the Jew, trembling; “don’t speak so loud!”"
"“什么先生不先生的，少来这一套。”这个凶神回答，“你来这一套时，从来就没安过好心。你知道我的名字，只管叫出来！这种时候，我没觉得我的名字有什么丢人的。”","“None of your mistering,” replied the ruffian; “you always mean mischief when you come that.You know my name: out with it!I shan’t disgrace it when the time comes.”"
"“嗯，嗯，那——比尔·赛克斯，”犹太佬低声下气地说，“你好像心情不佳，比尔。”","“Well, well, then—Bill Sikes,” said the Jew, with abject humility.“You seem out of humour, Bill.”"
"“可能吧。”赛克斯回道，“我看你也不怎么舒坦，除非你不把四处乱摔白镴锅当回事。这可骗不了我。”“你疯了吗？”犹太佬边说边扯扯赛克斯的衣袖，指了指两个少年。","“Perhaps I am,” replied Sikes; “I should think you was rather out of sorts too, unless you mean as little harm when you throw pewter pots about, as you do when you blab and—” “Are you mad?” said the Jew, catching the man by the sleeve, and pointing towards the boys."
"对此回答，赛克斯显然比较满意，他在右耳边做了个打结的动作，又把头猛地偏向右边肩膀。犹太佬似乎对这种哑剧心领神会。接下来，汉子说了两句黑话，给自己讨了杯酒。他的话里这类玩意儿多的是，要是一一记录下来，还真是让人难以明白。","Mr. Sikes contented himself with tying an imaginary knot under his left ear, and jerking his head over on the right shoulder; a piece of dumb show which the Jew appeared to understand perfectly.He then, in cant terms, with which his whole conversation was plentifully besprinkled, but which would be quite unintelligible if they were recorded here, demanded a glass of liquor."
"“你可留点神，别往里面下毒。”赛克斯先生说着，把帽子放在了桌子上。","“And mind you don’t poison it,” said Mr. Sikes, laying his hat upon the table."
"这话是说着玩的。可是如果说话人看到犹太佬咬着惨白的嘴唇朝碗柜转身时那恶意的目光，大概会认为这种警告并非毫无必要，或者说，希望对蒸馏酿酒者的巧妙手法略加改造的这一想法（且不论该想法如何实施），在这位老绅士快活的心中并非从未出现。","This was said in jest; but if the speaker could have seen the evil leer with which the Jew bit his pale lip as he turned round to the cupboard, he might have thought the caution not wholly unnecessary, or the wish (at all events) to improve upon the distiller’s ingenuity not very far from the old gentleman’s merry heart."
"两三杯酒下肚后，赛克斯先生屈尊稍加理会了一下两个小绅士，这亲切的行为自然引起了一场谈话。谈话间，奥利弗被捕的起因、经过、结果全都给详详细细地讲了出来。当然，修改与加工也是不可缺少的，机灵鬼认为在这种场合下这样做是最为明智的。","After swallowing two of three glasses of spirits, Mr. Sikes condescended to take some notice of the young gentlemen; which gracious act led to a conversation, in which the cause and manner of Oliver’s capture were circumstantially detailed, with such alterations and improvements on the truth, as to the Dodger appeared most advisable under the circumstances."
"“我担心，”犹太佬说，“他会讲出一些事情，把我们也牵扯进去。”","“I’m afraid,” said the Jew, “that he may say something which will get us into trouble.”"
"“这很有可能，”赛克斯恶毒地笑了笑，“费金，你要倒霉了。”","“That’s very likely,” returned Sikes with a malicious grin.“You’re blowed upon, Fagin.”"
"“你瞧，我也有些担心，”犹太佬继续说，仿佛对对方的打岔丝毫没在意似的，说话时眼睛一动不动地盯着对方，“我担心，如果这事牵扯上我们，可就闹大了。这样的话可能对你比对我更加不利，我亲爱的先生。”","“And I’m afraid, you see,” added the Jew, speaking as if he had not noticed the interruption; and regarding the other closely as he did so,—“I’m afraid that, if the game was up with us, it might be up with a good many more, and that it would come out rather worse for you than it would for me, my dear.”"
"赛克斯微微一震，朝费金转过身来。老绅士耸了耸肩，肩膀都快碰着耳朵了，眼睛茫然地盯着对面的墙。","The man started, and turned round upon the Jew.But the old gentleman’s shoulders were shrugged up to his ears; and his eyes were vacantly staring on the opposite wall."
"大家都不说话了。这个可敬的团队中的每个人都陷入了沉思，连那只狗也不例外。它恶狠狠地舔着自己的嘴唇，像是正在琢磨出门后怎么给在街上遇到的第一位先生或者太太的腿来上一口。","There was a long pause.Every member of the respectable coterie appeared plunged in his own reflections; not excepting the dog, who by a certain malicious licking of his lips seemed to be meditating an attack upon the legs of the first gentleman or lady he might encounter in the streets when he went out."
"“得有人到局子里去打听打听。”赛克斯先生的嗓门比刚进门那会儿低了好多。","“Somebody must find out wot’s been done at the office,” said Mr. Sikes in a much lower tone than he had taken since he came in."
"犹太佬点头表示赞同。","The Jew nodded assent."
"“如果他还没招，而且给判了刑，那么在他出来之前就不用发愁了，”赛克斯先生说，“等他出来后我们可得看好他。你得想办法把他看住了。”","“If he hasn’t peached, and is committed, there’s no fear till he comes out again,” said Mr. Sikes, “and then he must be taken care on.You must get hold of him somehow.”"
"犹太佬再次点了点头。","Again the Jew nodded."
"这一行动方案的谨慎缜密显而易见，只是操作起来存在着一个极大的障碍。那就是，机灵鬼、查利·贝茨、费金和赛克斯先生，碰巧全部对接近警察局有一种根深蒂固的反感，无论怎么样都不愿意去。","The prudence of this line of action, indeed, was obvious; but, unfortunately, there was one very strong objection to its being adopted.This was, that the Dodger, and Charley Bates, and Fagin, and Mr. William Sikes, happened, one and all, to entertain a violent and deeply-rooted antipathy to going near a police-office on any ground or pretext whatever."
"他们就这样坐着，面面相觑，这种心中犹疑不安的情形最令人不愉快了。没有人知道他们这样坐了多久。不过，倒也无需推测他们究竟坐了多久。奥利弗以前见过的那两位小姐突然莅临，使得谈话再次活跃了起来。","How long they might have sat and looked at each other, in a state of uncertainty not the most pleasant of its kind, it is difficult to guess.It is not necessary to make any guesses on the subject, however; for the sudden entrance of the two young ladies whom Oliver had seen on a former occasion, caused the conversation to flow afresh."
"“来的正是时候。”犹太佬说，“贝特一定会去的，是吧？”","“The very thing!” said the Jew.“Bet will go; won’t you, my dear?”"
"“去哪儿？”一个年轻小姐问。","“Wheres?” inquired the young lady."
"“只是到局子里去一趟，亲爱的小姐。”犹太佬诱骗道。","“Only just up to the office, my dear,” said the Jew coaxingly."
"应当为这位年轻小姐说句话，她并没有明确断言自己不想去，而只是表达了一个强烈而热切的愿望：如果去的话，她宁可“天诛地灭”。这是一个客气而又巧妙的借口。由此可见，这位小姐天生具有良好的教养，不忍心断然拒绝另一位同胞，使其蒙受被拒之苦。","It is due to the young lady to say that she did not positively affirm that she would not, but that she merely expressed an emphatic and earnest desire to be “blessed” if she would;a polite and delicate evasion of the request, which shows the young lady to have been possessed of that natural good breeding which cannot bear to inflict upon a fellow-creature, the pain of a direct and pointed refusal."
"犹太佬的脸色阴沉了下来。他将视线从这位身穿红色大衣、绿色靴子，头上带着黄色卷发纸的年轻小姐身上移开。她虽说不上雍容华贵，倒也打扮得花哨艳丽。他转向另一位姑娘。","The Jew’s countenance fell.He turned from this young lady, who was gaily, not to say gorgeously attired, in a red gown, green boots, and yellow curl-papers, to the ot her female."
"“南希，亲爱的，”费金用温和的口吻说，“你认为怎么样？”","“Nancy, my dear,” said the Jew in a soothing manner, “what do YOU say?”"
"“我看这方法行不通。不用试了，费金。”南希回答。","“That it won’t do; so it’s no use a-trying it on, Fagin,” replied Nancy."
"“你什么意思？”赛克斯先生抬起头，阴沉地说。","“What do you mean by that?” said Mr. Sikes, looking up in a surly manner."
"“我就是这个意思，比尔。”年轻小姐冷静地说。","“What I say, Bill,” replied the lady collectedly."
"“唔，我看你是最适合的人，”赛克斯先生劝道，“这附近没有人知道你的底细。”","“Why, you’re just the very person for it,” reasoned Mr. Sikes: “nobody about here knows anything of you.”"
"“我不希望他们知道，”南希依旧沉着冷静地说，“比尔，我看多一事不如少一事。”","“And as I don’t want ’em to, neither,” replied Nancy in the same composed manner, “it’s rather more no than yes with me, Bill.”"
"“费金，她会去的。”赛克斯说道。","“She’ll go, Fagin,” said Sikes."
"“不，费金，我不会去的。”南希说。","“No, she won’t, Fagin,” said Nancy."
"“不，她会的，费金。”赛克斯说。","“Yes, she will, Fagin,” said Sikes."
"赛克斯说对了。经过轮番威胁、许诺、收买，这位小姐最终还是屈服，接受了任务。她的情况跟她的好朋友不一样，因为她最近刚从稍远但却相当出名的拉特克利夫郊区搬到菲尔德小巷附近，她并不担心自己会被熟人认出来。","And Mr. Sikes was right.By dint of alternate threats, promises, and bribes, the lady in question was ultimately prevailed upon to undertake the commission.She was not, indeed, withheld by the same considerations as her agreeable friend; for, having recently removed into the neighborhood of Field Lane from the remote but genteel suburb of Ratcliffe, she was not under the same apprehension of being recognised by any of her numerous acquaintances."
"于是，她把一块洁白的围裙系到大衣外面，又戴上了一顶稻草软帽，遮住了卷发纸，这两样东西都是从犹太佬那取之不尽的储备中找来的。弄完这些，南希小姐准备动身执行任务了。","Accordingly, with a clean white apron tied over her gown, and her curl-papers tucked up under a straw bonnet,—both articles of dress being provided from the Jew’s inexhaustible stock,—Miss Nancy prepared to issue forth on her errand."
"“等一下，亲爱的，”犹太佬边说边拿出一个有盖的小篮子，“一手拎着这个。这样看起来更像个规矩人，我亲爱的。”","“Stop a minute, my dear,” said the Jew, producing, a little covered basket.“Carry that in one hand.It looks more respectable, my dear.”"
"“给她把大门钥匙，拿在另一只手上，费金，”赛克斯说，“这样看上去才比较真实且体面。”","“Give her a door-key to carry in her t’other one, Fagin,” said Sikes; “it looks real and genivine like.”"
"“对，对，亲爱的，是这么回事。”犹太佬把一把临街大门的钥匙挂在姑娘右手食指上。","“Yes, yes, my dear, so it does,” said the Jew, hanging a large street-door key on the forefinger of the young lady’s right hand."
"“这就对了，好极了！真的好极了，亲爱的！”犹太佬搓着手说道。","“There; very good!Very good indeed, my dear!” said the Jew, rubbing his hands."
"“噢，我亲爱的弟弟！我可怜的、可亲的、可爱的、天真的弟弟啊！”南希放声痛哭起来，边哭边痛苦地将篮子跟大门钥匙搓来搓去。“不知道他现在怎么样了！他们把他带到哪里去了！天啊，可怜可怜我吧，告诉我这个可爱的孩子到底怎么了！先生们，求求你们了，行行好吧！”","“Oh, my brother!My poor, dear, sweet, innocent little brother!” exclaimed Nancy, bursting into tears, and wringing the little basket and the street-door key in an agony of distress.“What has become of him!Where have they taken him to!Oh, do have pity, and tell me what’s been done with the dear boy, gentlemen; do, gentlemen, if you please, gentlemen!”"
"说完这段声泪俱下、撕心裂肺的台词，南希停了下来，冲她的同伴们眨了眨眼。在场的各位对此颇为满意。于是南希笑着向各位点点头，便离开了。","Having uttered those words in a most lamentable and heart-broken tone: to the immeasurable delight of her hearers: Miss Nancy paused, winked to the company, nodded smilingly round, and disappeared."
"“她可真是个聪明的小丫头，亲爱的各位，”犹太佬说着，转向他那群年轻的朋友，接着又严肃地摇摇头，似乎在暗示他们应该多向这个好榜样学习一下。","“Ah, she’s a clever girl, my dears,” said the Jew, turning round to his young friends, and shaking his head gravely, as if in mute admonition to them to follow the bright example they had just beheld."
"“她算是娘们儿中比较能干的了，”赛克斯先生为自己斟上了酒，用他的大拳头捶了一下桌子，说道，“为她的健康干杯。但愿他们个个都像她这么能干！”","“She’s a honour to her sex,” said Mr. Sikes, filling his glass, and smiting the table with his enormous fist. “Here’s her health, and wishing they was all like her!”"
"正当这铺天盖地的溢美之词纷纷加到才华出众的南希身上时，这位姑娘正以最快的速度赶往警察局。由于形单影只，没有丝毫的保护与陪伴，她难免显得有几分胆怯。尽管如此，没过多久，她还是平平安安地到达了警察局。","While these, and many other encomiums, were being passed on the accomplished Nancy, that young lady made the best of her way to the police-office; whither, notwithstanding a little natural timidity consequent upon walking through the streets alone and unprotected, she arrived in perfect safety shortly afterwards."
"她从警察局后面的那条路走了进去，用钥匙在一扇牢门上轻轻地敲了敲，留神听着。里面没有声音。她咳了两声，又听了听。依旧没有声响。于是她开口说话了。","Entering by the back way, she tapped softly with the key at one of the cell-doors, and listened.There was no sound within: so she coughed and listened again.Still there was no reply: so she spoke."
"“诺利在吗？”南希小声地询问，“诺利在不在？”","“Nolly, dear?” murmured Nancy in a gentle voice; “Nolly?”"
"屋里只关着一个不幸的犯人，连鞋子也没有穿。他是因为吹长笛被关起来的。范昂长官已经明确证明了他犯有扰乱社会治安罪，并做出了极为恰当的判决：在感化院里关一个月。范昂长官中肯而又不乏风趣地指明，既然他的力气多得没地方使，用在踏车上显然比用在乐器上更加有利于健康。这个倒霉鬼没有回答，他尚在为失去笛子而痛苦，那东西已经充公了。于是南希走到隔壁一间牢房，敲了敲门。","There was nobody inside but a miserable shoeless criminal, who had been taken up for playing the flute, and who, the offence against society having been clearly proved, had been very properly committed by Mr. Fang to the House of Correction for one month;with the appropriate and amusing remark that since he had so much breath to spare, it would be more wholesomely expended on the treadmill than in a musical instrument.He made no answer: being occupied mentally bewailing the loss of the flute, which had been confiscated for the use of the county: so Nancy passed on to the next cell, and knocked there."
"“唉！”传出一个有气无力的声音。","“Well!” cried a faint and feeble voice."
"“这儿有没有关着一个小男孩啊？”南希用早已准备好的呜咽声询问。","“Is there a little boy here?” inquired Nancy, with a preliminary sob."
"“没有，”那声音答道，“没有那事。”","“No,” replied the voice; “God forbid.”"
"这是一个年过六旬的流浪汉，他是因为不吹长笛而被关进监狱的。换句话说，是因为不为生计劳作，只是沿街乞讨而被抓进来的。再下面一间牢房关着另一个男人，罪名是无营业执照销售平底铁锅。他倒是自谋生路，可是做出这种无视税务局的事情，怎能不进监狱！","This was a vagrant of sixty-five, who was going to prison for not playing the flute; or, in other words, for begging in the streets, and doing nothing for his livelihood.In the next cell was another man, who was going to the same prison for hawking tin saucepans without license; thereby doing something for his living, in defiance of the Stamp-office."
"这些囚犯对奥利弗的名字全都没有反应，都说没有听说过这人，南希只好径直找到那位穿条纹背心的率直警官。她充满哀怨地抽泣着，求他把自己的小弟弟还给自己，那大门钥匙和小篮子的作用展现得淋漓尽致，使她显得越发楚楚可怜。","But, as neither of these criminals answered to the name of Oliver, or knew anything about him, Nancy made straight up to the bluff officer in the striped waistcoat; and with the most piteous wailings and lamentations, rendered more piteous by a prompt and efficient use of the street-door key and the little basket, demanded her own dear brother."
"“我没有抓他啊，我亲爱的姑娘。”老人说。","“I haven’t got him, my dear,” said the old man."
"“那他在哪里啊？”南希近乎发狂地问道。","“Where is he?” screamed Nancy, in a distracted manner."
"“嗯，那位绅士把他带走了。”警官回答。","“Why, the gentleman’s got him,” replied the officer."
"“什么绅士！啊，我的天啊！哪位绅士？”南希嚷道。","“What gentleman!Oh, gracious heavens!What gentleman?” exclaimed Nancy."
"在回复这一番语无伦次的询问时，老人告诉这位演技精湛的姑娘，奥利弗在警察局里得了病，一位目击证人证明了偷东西的是另一个没被监禁的男孩，于是他便被当庭释放。原告见他不省人事，就把他带到自己的住处了。至于具体地点，老警察也只知道是在本顿维尔的一个什么地方。因为他听到有人在叫马车的时候提到了这个名字。","In reply to this incoherent questioning, the old man informed the deeply affected sister that Oliver had been taken ill in the office, and discharged in consequence of a witness having proved the robbery to have been committed by another boy, not in custody; and that the prosecutor had carried him away, in an insensible condition, to his own residence:of and concerning which, all the informant knew was, that it was somewhere in Pentonville, he having heard that word mentioned in the directions to the coachman."
"极度痛苦的姑娘半信半疑、步履蹒跚地朝门口走去。出门后，她便箭步如飞，沿着最复杂迂回的路线回到了犹太佬的住处。","In a dreadful state of doubt and uncertainty, the agonised young woman staggered to the gate, and then, exchanging her faltering walk for a swift run, returned by the most devious and complicated route she could think of, to the domicile of the Jew."
"比尔·赛克斯听完这次探险的报告，立马叫醒那条白狗，戴上帽子，匆匆离开了。他走得如此之急，以至于把向同伴道声早安的礼节都省了。","Mr. Bill Sikes no sooner heard the account of the expedition delivered, than he very hastily called up the white dog, and, putting on his hat, expeditiously departed: without devoting any time to the formality of wishing the company good-morning."
"“我们必须搞清楚他在哪里，亲爱的，一定得把他找回来。”犹太佬非常激动地说，“查利，你什么事也别做了，出去四处逛逛吧！听到有什么关于他的消息就立马带回来。南希，亲爱的，我一定要找到他。我相信你，亲爱的，在任何事上我都相信你跟机灵鬼！等等，等等，”犹太佬用他那哆嗦着的手打开了抽屉，“拿点钱出去，我亲爱的。今晚铺子得关一关。你们知道去哪里找我的。一分钟也别在这儿多呆了。赶快走吧，亲爱的孩子们！”","“We must know where he is, my dears; he must be found,” said the Jew greatly excited.“Charley, do nothing but skulk about, till you bring home some news of him!Nancy, my dear, I must have him found.I trust to you, my dear,—to you and the Artful for everything!Stay, stay,” added the Jew, unlocking a drawer with a shaking hand; “there’s money, my dears.I shall shut up this shop to-night.You’ll know where to find me!Don’t stop here a minute.Not an instant, my dears!”"
"他边说边把他们推出了房间，随后小心翼翼地在门上上了两道锁，插上门闩。他从暗处取出那个曾经不经意暴露在奥利弗面前的匣子。然后他慌忙开始把金表和珠宝往衣服里塞。","With these words, he pushed them from the room: and carefully double-locking and barring the door behind them, drew from its place of concealment the box which he had unintentionally disclosed to Oliver.Then, he hastily proceeded to dispose the watches and jewellery beneath his clothing."
"门口传来一阵敲门声，把他吓了一跳。“谁啊？”他厉声喝道。","A rap at the door startled him in this occupation.“Who’s there?” he cried in a shrill tone."
"“是我！”机灵鬼的声音从锁眼里传来。","“Me!” replied the voice of the Dodger, through the key-hole."
"“又怎么了？”犹太佬不耐烦地问。","“What now?” cried the Jew impatiently."
"“南希问，是不是要把他捉到另一个窝去？”机灵鬼问道。","“Is he to be kidnapped to the other ken, Nancy says?” inquired the Dodger."
"“嗯，”犹太佬回答，“不管她在哪里找到他，都这么办。一定要找到他，把他找出来，就是这样。后面怎么办我心中有数。不用害怕。”","“Yes,” replied the Jew, “wherever she lays hands on him.Find him, find him out, that’s all.I shall know what to do next; never fear.”"
"孩子低声回答说知道了，便匆忙下楼追他的同伴了。","The boy murmured a reply of intelligence: and hurried downstairs after his companions."
"“到现在他还没有供出我们，”费金一边说一边继续忙自己的事，“他要是打算在新朋友那儿泄露我们的事，那就得封住他的嘴了。”","“He has not peached so far,” said the Jew as he pursued his occupation.“If he means to blab us among his new friends, we may stop his mouth yet.”"
"第十四章 对奥利弗在布朗洛先生家情形的详细描述，以及在他外出办事时一位叫格林维格的先生为他所作的一番值得注意的预言","CHAPTER XIV Comprising further particulars of Oliver’s stay at Mr. Brownlow’s, with the remarkable prediction which one Mr. Grimwig uttered concerning him, when he went out on an errand   "
"伴着布朗洛先生一声惊呼，小奥利弗吓得昏了过去。没过多久，他再次醒来了。在随后的谈话中，老先生和贝德温太太都尽量避免提起画中人，对奥利弗的过去和将来也只字不提，而是努力找些能够让他快乐又不刺激他的话题。他的身体依旧很虚弱，尚无法起床吃早饭。第二天，当他下楼走进女管家的屋里时，做的第一件事就是急切地朝那面墙望去，希望能够再次看到那位漂亮女士的脸。但是，希望落空了。肖像画被人取走了。","Oliver soon recovering from the fainting-fit into which Mr. Brownlow’s abrupt exclamation had thrown him, the subject of the picture was carefully avoided, both by the old gentleman and Mrs. Bedwin, in the conversation that ensued: which indeed bore no reference to Oliver’s history or prospects, but was confined to such topics as might amuse without exciting him.He was still too weak to get up to breakfast; but, when he came down into the housekeeper’s room next day, his first act was to cast an eager glance at the wall, in the hope of again looking on the face of the beautiful lady.His expectations were disappointed, however, for the picture had been removed."
"“哎呀！”女管家注意到奥利弗眼睛盯着的方向，“你瞧，已经没了。”","“Ah!” said the housekeeper, watching the direction of Oliver’s eyes.“It is gone, you see.”"
"“嗯，我已经注意到了，太太。”奥利弗回答，“他们为什么要把它拿走？”","“I see it is ma’am,” replied Oliver.“Why have they taken it away?”"
"“它被取下来了，亲爱的孩子。因为布朗洛先生说，它似乎会使你很难受，说不定会影响你的身体康复。你明白了吧。”老太太又说道。","“It has been taken down, child, because Mr. Brownlow said, that as it seemed to worry you, perhaps it might prevent your getting well, you know,” rejoined the old lady."
"“噢，不，真的。它一点也没有让我难受，太太，”奥利弗说，“我喜欢看这幅画。我真的可喜欢它了。”","“Oh, no, indeed.It didn’t worry me, ma’am,” said Oliver.“I liked to see it.I quite loved it.”"
"“好，好！”老太太好脾气地说，“你尽快把身体养好，亲爱的。画会被重新挂回去的。好啦！我保证！来，我们还是谈点别的事情吧！”","“Well, well!” said the old lady, good-humouredly; “you get well as fast as ever you can, dear, and it shall be hung up again.There!I promise you that!Now, let us talk about something else.”"
"此刻，奥利弗知道的所有关于那张肖像画的情况，也就是这些了。他想到在自己生病期间，老太太对自己那么好，便决定眼下再也不去想这事了。他认真地听老太太给他讲故事。老太太讲了许多故事，讲到她有一个温柔大方的女儿，嫁了一个英俊亲切的丈夫，他们住在乡下。她还讲到她有一个儿子，在西印度群岛给一个商人做职员，他是个挺好、挺孝顺的年轻人，每年都要往家里写四封信。提到这些信，老太太眼睛又红了。老太太花了很长时间讲她儿女的长处，然后她又讲到她那温柔善良的老头子的无数优点，他已经去世了，真可怜啊！整整二十六年了！喝茶的时间到了。喝过茶，她开始教奥利弗玩纸牌。奥利弗学得很快，一教就会。两人玩得很带劲，一直玩到了奥利弗该喝点温热的红葡萄酒和水，该吃点烤面包了，两人才停下来。他吃完喝完便开心地去睡觉了。","This was all the information Oliver could obtain about the picture at that time.As the old lady had been so kind to him in his illness, he endeavoured to think no more of the subject just then; so he listened attentively to a great many stories she told him, about an amiable and handsome daughter of hers, who was married to an amiable and handsome man, and lived in the country;and about a son, who was clerk to a merchant in the West Indies; and who was, also, such a good young man, and wrote such dutiful letters home four times a-year, that it brought the tears into her eyes to talk about them.When the old lady had expatiated, a long time, on the excellences of her children, and the merits of her kind good husband besides, who had been dead and gone, poor dear soul! just six-and-twenty years, it was time to have tea.After tea she began to teach Oliver cribbage: which he learnt as quickly as she could teach: and at which game they played, with great interest and gravity, until it was time for the invalid to have some warm wine and water, with a slice of dry toast, and then to go cosily to bed."
"奥利弗恢复健康的那段日子，是多么幸福啊！周围的一切都是那么安静、整洁、有序；每个人都是如此友好、善良。他向来是生活在那种喧嚣吵闹的环境中，在他看来，这儿简直就是天堂。他刚刚恢复到能够自己动手体面地穿衣服，布朗洛先生就迫不及待地叫人给他准备了一套新衣服、一顶新帽子、一双新鞋。奥利弗被告知自己可以随便处理他的那些旧衣服，就把它们统统给了一个对他很好的女仆，让她拿去找个犹太佬卖了，钱自己留着。这事她很快就办好了。奥利弗从客厅的窗户望了出去，瞅见那个买主犹太人把衣服卷成卷，放进袋里便离去了。他感到十分开心，心想这些东西总算妥善处理好了，自己也不会再次穿它们了。说实话，那些衣服已经破得都快成碎布了，而奥利弗还是头一回穿一套新衣服。","They were happy days, those of Oliver’s recovery.Everything was so quiet, and neat, and orderly; everybody so kind and gentle; that after the noise and turbulence in the midst of which he had always lived, it seemed like Heaven itself.He was no sooner strong enough to put his clothes on, properly, than Mr. Brownlow caused a complete new suit, and a new cap, and a new pair of shoes, to be provided for him.As Oliver was told that he might do what he liked with the old clothes, he gave them to a servant who had been very kind to him, and asked her to sell them to a Jew, and keep the money for herself.This she very readily did; and, as Oliver looked out of the parlour window, and saw the Jew roll them up in his bag and walk away, he felt quite delighted to think that they were safely gone, and that there was now no possible danger of his ever being able to wear them again.They were sad rags, to tell the truth; and Oliver had never had a new suit before."
"肖像事件过后大约一周的某天傍晚，奥利弗正坐着跟贝德温太太聊天，布朗洛先生传话下来，说如果奥利弗·特威斯特感觉精神不错的话，他希望能在书房里见见他，跟他聊聊。","One evening, about a week after the affair of the picture, as he was sitting talking to Mrs. Bedwin, there came a message down from Mr. Brownlow, that if Oliver Twist felt pretty well, he should like to see him in his study, and talk to him a little while."
"“天哪，老天保佑！你去洗洗手，我来帮你弄一个漂亮的分头。”贝德温太太说，“亲爱的，早知道他叫你过去，我们应该给你戴一条干净的领子，把你打扮得像六便士银币那么漂亮！”","“Bless us, and save us!Wash your hands, and let me part your hair nicely for you, child,” said Mrs. Bedwin.“Dear heart alive!If we had known he would have asked for you, we would have put you a clean collar on, and made you as smart as sixpence!”"
"奥利弗照着老太太的吩咐做了。与此同时，老太太一直在极度惋惜没有时间在他的衬衫衣领边缘理出一道小小的皱边。尽管少了这么重要的优势，他的样子还是十分温文尔雅、好看大方。老太太满意地将他从头到脚打量了一番，说就算是早早接到通知，也未必能够把他打扮得更加完美。","Oliver did as the old lady bade him; and, although she lamented grievously, meanwhile, that there was not even time to crimp the little frill that bordered his shirt-collar;he looked so delicate and handsome, despite that important personal advantage, that she went so far as to say: looking at him with great complacency from head to foot, that she really didn’t think it would have been possible, on the longest notice, to have made much difference in him for the better."
"带着老太太的鼓励，奥利弗敲了敲书房的门。听到布朗洛先生让他进去，他便走进了一间小小的里屋，里面全是书。屋里有一扇窗户，正对着几个好看的小花圃。窗户旁边有一张桌子，布朗洛先生正坐在桌子旁读书。一见到奥利弗，他便把书推到了一边，叫他到桌子旁边坐下来。奥利弗照办了。他心里挺纳闷，不知道上哪儿能找到要读这么多书的人，这些书好像是为了让世人变得聪明而写的。这一点，即使是对那些比奥利弗更有见识的人来说，也依旧是他们每日生活中一件不可思议的事情。","Thus encouraged, Oliver tapped at the study door.On Mr. Brownlow calling to him to come in, he found himself in a little back room, quite full of books, with a window, looking into some pleasant little gardens.There was a table drawn up before the window, at which Mr. Brownlow was seated reading.When he saw Oliver, he pushed the book away from him, and told him to come near the table, and sit down.Oliver complied; marvelling where the people could be found to read such a great number of books as seemed to be written to make the world wiser.Which is still a marvel to more experienced people than Oliver Twist, every day of their lives."
"“这里的书可真多，是吧，我的孩子？”布朗洛先生注意到奥利弗对书房充满着好奇心，一直打量着从地板一直顶到天花板的书架。","“There are a good many books, are there not, my boy?” said Mr. Brownlow, observing the curiosity with which Oliver surveyed the shelves that reached from the floor to the ceiling."
"“确实有很多书，先生，”奥利弗回答，“我从来没见到过这么多书。”","“A great number, sir,” replied Oliver.“I never saw so many.”"
"“你要是表现好，也可以读读这些书，”老先生和颜悦色地说，“你会喜欢它们的，而不光是它们的外表——在有些情况下，有些书的精华之处还真的仅仅是它的封面和封底。”","“You shall read them, if you behave well,” said the old gentleman kindly; “and you will like that, better than looking at the outsides,—that is, some cases; because there are books of which the backs and covers are by far the best parts.”"
"“我猜是那些厚的书，先生。”奥利弗说着，指指那些封面烫金的四开本大书。","“I suppose they are those heavy ones, sir,” said Oliver, pointing to some large quartos, with a good deal of gilding about the binding."
"“那倒不一定，”老先生拍拍奥利弗的头，微微笑着说道，“有一些书同样很重要，尽管篇幅要小得多。想不想长大后也做个聪明的人，也写书？”","“Not always those,” said the old gentleman, patting Oliver on the head, and smiling as he did so; “there are other equally heavy ones, though of a much smaller size.How should you like to grow up a clever man, and write books, eh?”"
"“我想我还是更愿意读读它们，先生。”奥利弗回答。","“I think I would rather read them, sir,” replied Oliver."
"“什么！难道你不想当个作家？”老先生说道。","“What! wouldn’t you like to be a book-writer?” said the old gentleman."
"奥利弗想了一会儿，最后才说，他觉得当一个卖书的人可能会更好一些。听了这番话，老先生由衷地笑了起来，夸他的想法很妙。奥利弗很开心，尽管他并不知道自己的想法妙在何处。","Oliver considered a little while; and at last said, he should think it would be a much better thing to be a book-seller; upon which the old gentleman laughed heartily, and declared he had said a very good thing.Which Oliver felt glad to have done, though he by no means knew what it was."
"“好啦，好啦，”老绅士平静了下来，说道，“别怕！我们不把你培养成一个作家就是了，只要是正当手艺都可以学，或者学学制砖也行。”","“Well, well,” said the old gentleman, composing his features.“Don’t be afraid!We won’t make an author of you, while there’s an honest trade to be learnt, or brick-making to turn to.”"
"“谢谢您，先生。”奥利弗回答说。奥利弗回答时那种无比认真的神情又把布朗洛先生逗笑了，他还提到了一种奇怪的直觉什么的。奥利弗对此不怎么理解，因此也没大在意。","“Thank you, sir,” said Oliver.At the earnest manner of his reply, the old gentleman laughed again; and said something about a curious instinct, which Oliver, not understanding, paid no very great attention to."
"“唔，”布朗洛先生尽量想说得温和一些，但是同时他的态度比以往奥利弗见过的要严肃得多，“好孩子，我希望你能认认真真听我下面讲的话。我希望能够毫无保留地跟你谈一次，因为我相信你完全能够懂我的意思，就像成年人那样。”","“Now,” said Mr. Brownlow, speaking if possible in a kinder, but at the same time in a much more serious manner, than Oliver had ever known him assume yet, “I want you to pay great attention, my boy, to what I am going to say.I shall talk to you without any reserve; because I am sure you are well able to understand me, as many older persons would be.”"
"“哦，先生，不要告诉我您要把我送走，求您了！”奥利弗大叫起来。老先生这番开场白的严肃语气吓到他了。“别把我赶出去，别让我继续到大街上流浪。让我留在这儿当个仆人吧。不要把我送回到原来那个鬼地方了。先生，求求你，可怜可怜我这个穷孩子吧！”","“Oh, don’t tell you are going to send me away, sir, pray!” exclaimed Oliver, alarmed at the serious tone of the old gentleman’s commencement!“Don’t turn me out of doors to wander in the streets again.Let me stay here, and be a servant.Don’t send me back to the wretched place I came from.Have mercy upon a poor boy, sir!”"
"“我亲爱的孩子，”老先生被奥利弗突如其来的请求感动了，“你不用害怕，我不会抛弃你，除非你给我这么做的理由。”","“My dear child,” said the old gentleman, moved by the warmth of Oliver’s sudden appeal; “you need not be afraid of my deserting you, unless you give me cause.”"
"“我不会的，先生，永远不会的。”奥利弗抢着说。","“I never, never will, sir,” interposed Oliver."
"“但愿如此，”老先生答应道，“我相信你不会那样。从前，我曾努力帮助过一些人，到头来被骗了。但是，我仍然愿意相信你。我自己都不清楚自己为什么会这么关心你。我曾经深爱过的那些人，都已经长眠于地下了，我平生所有的快乐与幸福也都埋在了那里，不过我尚未把这颗心做成一口棺材，把所有的感情永远密封起来。深深的痛苦只是使所有的感情越发强烈且纯净了。”","“I hope not,” rejoined the old gentleman.“I do not think you ever will.I have been deceived, before, in the objects whom I have endeavoured to benefit; but I feel strongly disposed to trust you, nevertheless; and I am more interested in your behalf than I can well account for, even to myself.The persons on whom I have bestowed my dearest love, lie deep in their graves; but, although the happiness and delight of my life lie buried there too, I have not made a coffin of my heart, and sealed it up, forever, on my best affections.Deep affliction has but strengthened and refined them.”"
"老先生低声讲道，与其说他在跟奥利弗讲，不如说他是在自言自语。随后，他稍稍停了一下，奥利弗一声不响地坐在旁边。","As the old gentleman said this in a low voice: more to himself than to his companion: and as he remained silent for a short time afterwards: Oliver sat quite still."
"“好了，好了！”老先生最后开口了，语气比较轻松，“我说这些只是因为你有一颗年轻的心。让你知道我曾经遭受的痛苦与悲伤，你就会更加小心，可能就不会再一次伤我的心了。你说你是一个孤儿，无依无靠，我多方打听的结果也证实了这一点。让我听听你的故事吧。说说你是哪里人，是谁把你带大的，又是怎么结交上我见到你时你的那几个同伴的。把真相统统告诉我吧。只要我活在世上一天，你就不会无依无靠。”","“Well, well!” said the old gentleman at length, in a more cheerful tone, “I only say this, because you have a young heart; and knowing that I have suffered great pain and sorrow, you will be more careful, perhaps, not to wound me again.You say you are an orphan, without a friend in the world; all the inquiries I have been able to make, confirm the statement.Let me hear your story; where you come from; who brought you up; and how you got into the company in which I found you.Speak the truth, and you shall not be friendless while I live.”"
"奥利弗开始哽咽起来，好一会儿都说不出话来。他刚要开始讲自己是怎样在一个农场长大，怎样被邦布尔先生带到了济贫院里，大门口传来一阵不耐烦的“砰砰、砰砰”的敲门声。仆人上楼报告说，格林维格先生来了。","Oliver’s sobs checked his utterance for some minutes; when he was on the point of beginning to relate how he had been brought up at the farm, and carried to the workhouse by Mr. Bumble, a peculiarly impatient little double-knock was heard at the street-door: and the servant, running upstairs, announced Mr. Grimwig."
"“他上楼来了吗？”布朗洛先生问道。","“Is he coming up?” inquired Mr. Brownlow."
"“是的，先生，”仆人答道，“他问家里有没有松饼，我告诉他有，他说他是来喝茶的。”","“Yes, sir,” replied the servant.“He asked if there were any muffins in the house; and, when I told him yes, he said he had come to tea.”"
"布朗洛先生笑了笑，转身告诉奥利弗格林维格先生是他的一位老朋友，可不要因为他举止有些粗鲁就耿耿于怀，因为他内里是个大好人。布朗洛先生这样说是有依据的。","Mr. Brownlow smiled; and, turning to Oliver, said that Mr. Grimwig was an old friend of his, and he must not mind his being a little rough in his manners; for he was a worthy creature at bottom, as he had reason to know."
"“要我下楼去吗？先生。”奥利弗问。","“Shall I go downstairs, sir?” inquired Oliver."
"“不用，”布朗洛先生回答，“我更愿意你留在这儿。”","“No,” replied Mr. Brownlow, “I would rather you remained here.”"
"这时，一位体格结实的老先生走了进来。他一腿略跛，手里握着一根粗大的手杖。他身穿蓝色外套、条纹背心，下身是棉布马裤、长筒橡胶靴，头戴一顶宽檐白色礼帽，绿色的边沿向上翻起。打着细密小褶的衬衣皱边从背心里伸出来，下面晃着一条长长的怀表钢链，表链末端摇摇晃晃地挂着一把钥匙。白色围巾的两头绞成一个橘子大小的小球。他面部扭动，做出各种各样的表情，那样子无法用语言形容。他说话时喜欢把头扭到一边，两只眼睛同时从眼角里向外瞅，难免会让人想到鹦鹉。他一进门就定在那里，摆出这种姿势：手臂伸得很长，手里握着一小块橘子皮，忿忿不平地吼着，","At this moment, there walked into the room: supporting himself by a thick stick: a stout old gentleman, rather lame in one leg, who was dressed in a blue coat, striped waistcoat, nankeen breeches and gaiters, and a broad-brimmed white hat, with the sides turned up with green.A very small-plaited shirt frill stuck out from his waistcoat; and a very long steel watch-chain, with nothing but a key at the end, dangled loosely below it.The ends of his white neckerchief were twisted into a ball about the size of an orange; the variety of shapes into which his countenance was twisted, defy description.He had a manner of screwing his head on one side when he spoke; and of looking out of the corners of his eyes at the same time: which irresistibly reminded the beholder of a parrot.In this attitude, he fixed himself, the moment he made his appearance; and, holding out a small piece of orange-peel at arm’s length, exclaimed, in a growling, discontented voice."
"“快看看！看见这个了吗？你说这是不是奇怪透顶？我每次去拜访一个人，就会在他家的楼梯上捡到一片这个东西！它简直是那个穷大夫的朋友。我曾经被橘子皮弄瘸了。我知道，它迟早有一天会要了我的命。要不是那样，叫我吃下自己的脑袋我也心甘情愿，先生！”","“Look here! do you see this!Isn’t it a most wonderful and extraordinary thing that I can’t call at a man’s house but I find a piece of this poor surgeon’s friend on the staircase?I’ve been lamed with orange-peel once, and I know orange-peel will be my death, or I’ll be content to eat my own head, sir!”"
"这是格林维格夸下的一句海口，他每次提出一种主张，几乎都要用这句话作后盾。从他自己的具体情况来看，这一点就更加不可思议。因为即使单看这句论断，姑且承认科学上的种种进步已经使得一位绅士在有强烈意愿时，能够吃下自己的脑袋，但是格林维格先生的脑袋奇大无比，就算是世界上最自信的人，也无法指望把它一顿吃下去——姑且完全不考虑脑袋上那层厚厚的发粉。","This was the handsome offer with which Mr. Grimwig backed and confirmed nearly every assertion he made; and it was the more singular in his case, because, even admitting for the sake of argument, the possibility of scientific improvements being brought to that pass which will enable a gentleman to eat his own head in the event of his being so disposed,Mr. Grimwig’s head was such a particularly large one, that the most sanguine man alive could hardly entertain a hope of being able to get through it at a sitting—to put entirely out of the question, a very thick coating of powder."
"“我可以把我的脑袋吃下去，先生．”格林维格先生重复了一遍，用他的手杖敲了敲地板，“喂！这是谁！”他打量着奥利弗，向后退了两步。","“I’ll eat my head, sir,” repeated Mr. Grimwig, striking his stick upon the ground.“Hallo! what’s that!” looking at Oliver, and retreating a pace or two."
"“这就是小奥利弗·特威斯特，我们之前讨论的就是他。”布朗洛先生说。","“This is young Oliver Twist, whom we were speaking about,” said Mr. Brownlow."
"奥利弗鞠了个躬。","Oliver bowed."
"“我想，你不是要说他就是那个患热病的小男孩吧？”格林维格先生说着又往后退了几步，“慢着！别说话！停——”格林维格先生继续说道，突然他有了新发现，之前对热病的恐惧顿时化为乌有，“他就是那个吃橘子的孩子！假如不是他吃的橘子，然后把皮扔在楼梯上的话，先生，我可以把我的脑袋连同他的一起吃下去。”","“You don’t mean to say that’s the boy who had the fever, I hope?” said Mr. Grimwig, recoiling a little more.“Wait a minute!Don’t speak!Stop—” continued Mr. Grimwig, abruptly, losing all dread of the fever in his triumph at the discovery; “that’s the boy who had the orange!If that’s not the boy, sir, who had the orange, and threw this bit of peel upon the staircase, I’ll eat my head, and his too.”"
"“不，不，他没有吃过橘子，”布朗洛先生笑着说，“行了！摘下帽子，跟我年轻的朋友聊聊吧。”","“No, no, he has not had one,” said Mr. Brownlow, laughing.“Come!Put down your hat; and speak to my young friend.”"
"“我对这个问题很有感触，先生，”这位易怒的老绅士一边摘手套，一边说道，“我们这条街的人行道上总是或多或少有几块橘子皮。我知道，这一定是街角处那个外科大夫的儿子丢在那里的。昨晚，有一个年轻妇女在一小块橘皮上滑了一跤，撞在我家的花园栏杆上。她一爬起来，我就发现她一个劲地瞅他那盏该死的红灯，那简直就是个马戏团的灯光广告。‘你别到他那儿去，’我向窗户外喊，‘他就是个凶手！专门坑人！’他确实是。如果他不是——”说到这儿，这位易怒的老绅士用手杖使劲敲了敲地板，他的朋友向来明白这个动作的意思，每当他找不到语言表达他的意思时，他就会把这个搬出来。随后，他依旧握着手杖，坐了下来，打开一副用黑色宽丝带挂在身上的眼镜，看了看奥利弗。奥利弗见自己成了观察对象，脸一下子红了，又鞠了一躬。","“I feel strongly on this subject, sir,” said the irritable old gentleman, drawing off his gloves.“There’s always more or less orange-peel on the pavement in our street; and I know it’s put there by the surgeon’s boy at the corner.A young woman stumbled over a bit last night, and fell against my garden-railings; directly she got up I saw her look towards his infernal red lamp with the pantomime-light.“Don’t go to him,” I called out of the window, “he’s an assassin!A man-trap!“So he is.If he is not—”Here the irascible old gentleman gave a great knock on the ground with his stick; which was always understood, by his friends, to imply the customary offer, whenever it was not expressed in words.Then, still keeping his stick in his hand, he sat down; and, opening a double eye-glass, which he wore attached to a broad black riband, took a view of Oliver: who, seeing that he was the object of inspection, coloured, and bowed again."
"“他就是那个孩子，是吧？”格林维格先生最后说。","“That’s the boy, is it?” said Mr. Grimwig, at length."
"“是那个孩子。”布朗洛先生回答。","“That’s the boy,” replied Mr. Brownlow."
"“孩子，你好吗？”格林维格先生问道。","“How are you, boy?” said Mr. Grimwig."
"“已经好多了，谢谢您，先生。”奥利弗答道。","“A great deal better, thank you, sir,” replied Oliver."
"布朗洛先生似乎意识到，这个与众不同的朋友定会说出一些令人不愉快的话，便打发奥利弗下楼告诉贝德温太太为他们准备点茶。奥利弗很不喜欢这位客人的举止态度，很乐意做这件事。","Mr. Brownlow, seeming to apprehend that his singular friend was about to say something disagreeable, asked Oliver to step downstairs and tell Mrs. Bedwin they were ready for tea; which, as he did not half like the visitor’s manner, he was very happy to do."
"“这个孩子很好看，是吧？”布朗洛先生问道。","“He is a nice-looking boy, is he not?” inquired Mr. Brownlow."
"“我不知道。”格林维格先生怒气冲冲地说。","“I don’t know,” replied Mr. Grimwig, pettishly."
"“你不知道？”","“Don’t know?”"
"“是啊。我不知道。我从来看不出小男孩之间有什么不同。我只知道有两种小男孩。一种是粉脸，一种是肉脸。”","“No.I don’t know.I never see any difference in boys.I only knew two sort of boys.Mealy boys, and beef-faced boys.”"
"“那奥利弗是哪一种呢？”","“And which is Oliver?”"
"“粉脸。我认识一位朋友，有一个肉脸的儿子。他们还叫他好孩子。他长着圆圆的脑袋，红彤彤的脸蛋，炯炯有神的眼睛。可那是一个相当可恶的孩子，身体和四肢简直就快把他蓝衣裳的线缝都撑破了，嗓门跟引航员差不多大，胃口大得如狼一般。我看透他了！那个坏蛋！”","“Mealy.I know a friend who has a beef-faced boy; a fine boy, they call him; with a round head, and red cheeks, and glaring eyes; a horrid boy; with a body and limbs that appear to be swelling out of the seams of his blue clothes; with the voice of a pilot, and the appetite of a wolf.I know him!The wretch!”"
"“行了，”布朗洛先生说，“小奥利弗·特威斯特可不是那样，不至于激起你那么大的火气。”","“Come,” said Mr. Brownlow, “these are not the characteristics of young Oliver Twist; so he needn’t excite your wrath.”"
"“可能不那样，”格林维格先生回答，“说不定更坏。”","“They are not,” replied Mr. Grimwig.“He may have worse.”"
"说到这儿，布朗洛先生不耐烦地咳嗽起来，这却似乎给格林维格先生带来了特别强烈的欢悦。","Here, Mr. Brownlow coughed impatiently; which appeared to afford Mr. Grimwig the most exquisite delight."
"“我只是说他可能会更坏。”格林维格先生重复道，“他从哪里来的？他叫什么？他是干什么的？他得过热病。那是怎么得的？热病不是只有好人才会得，是吧？坏人有时候也会染上热病，对不对，嗯？我认识一个朋友，他在牙买加因为谋杀主人被绞死了。他就得过六次热病，并没有因此得到宽恕。呸！那是胡说八道！”","“He may have worse, I say,” repeated Mr. Grimwig.“Where does he come from!Who is he?What is he?He has had a fever.What of that?Fevers are not peculiar to good people; are they?Bad people have fevers sometimes; haven’t they, eh?I knew a man who was hung in Jamaica for murdering his master.He had had a fever six times; he wasn’t recommended to mercy on that account.Pooh! nonsense!”"
"当时，情况是这样的：从内心深处说，格林维格先生很愿意承认奥利弗的相貌与举止非常讨人喜欢，但是他生来喜欢抬杠，这次因为捡到一块橘子皮，就更想抬杠了。他暗暗打定主意，没有人可以说服自己一个小男孩是漂亮还是不漂亮，从一开始，他就决定跟朋友对着干。布朗洛先生承认，到目前为止，没有一个问题他能给出令人满意的答案。他已经把调查奥利弗过去经历的事情搁到了一边，准备一直等到那个孩子可以经受得住的时候再说。格林维格先生恶意地笑了。他略带讽刺地询问，管家有没有晚上清点餐具的习惯．因为，要是她在某个阳光明媚的早上发现少了一两只勺子的话，嗯，他愿意——等等。","Now, the fact was, that in the inmost recesses of his own heart, Mr. Grimwig was strongly disposed to admit that Oliver’s appearance and manner were unusually prepossessing; but he had a strong appetite for contradiction, sharpened on this occasion by the finding of the orange-peel;and, inwardly determining that no man should dictate to him whether a boy was well-looking or not, he had resolved, from the first, to oppose his friend.When Mr. Brownlow admitted that on no one point of inquiry could he yet return a satisfactory answer; and that he had postponed any investigation into Oliver’s previous history until he thought the boy was strong enough to hear it; Mr. Grimwig chuckled maliciously.And he demanded, with a sneer, whether the housekeeper was in the habit of counting the plate at night; because if she didn’t find a table-spoon or two missing some sunshiny morning, why, he would be content to—and so forth."
"尽管布朗洛先生本人也是一个容易冲动的人，但是他深知朋友的怪脾气，因此对于这些他还是很迁就地容忍了。喝茶时，格林维格先生容光焕发地对松饼大为称赞，气氛还算融洽。奥利弗当时也在场，他也逐渐感到适应了，不再像之前那样对这位凶巴巴的老绅士的在场感到紧张万分。","All this, Mr. Brownlow, although himself somewhat of an impetuous gentleman: knowing his friend’s peculiarities, bore with great good humour; as Mr. Grimwig, at tea, was graciously pleased to express his entire approval of the muffins, matters went on very smoothly; and Oliver, who made one of the party, began to feel more at his ease than he had yet done in the fierce old gentleman’s presence."
"“你准备什么时候才详细地了解奥利弗所有真实的生活经历和遭遇呢？”吃过茶点，格林维格从侧面盯着奥利弗，重新向布朗洛先生提起了这件事。","“And when are you going to hear a full, true, and particular account of the life and adventures of Oliver Twist?” asked Grimwig of Mr. Brownlow, at the conclusion of the meal; looking sideways at Oliver, as he resumed his subject."
"“明天上午，”布朗洛先生回答道，“到时候我希望单独跟他谈谈。明天上午十点来我这儿，亲爱的。”","“To-morrow morning,” replied Mr. Brownlow.“I would rather he was alone with me at the time.Come up to me to-morrow morning at ten o’clock, my dear.”"
"“好的，先生。”奥利弗答道。由于格林维格先生一直盯着自己，目光严厉，奥利弗有点迷惑，因此回答起来有些迟疑。","“Yes, sir,” replied Oliver.He answered with some hesitation, because he was confused by Mr. Grimwig’s looking so hard at him."
"“我跟你说，”格林维格先生低声对布朗洛先生说道，“他明天上午不会来找你的。我看得出他很犹豫。他在骗你呢，我亲爱的朋友。”","“I’ll tell you what,” whispered that gentleman to Mr. Brownlow; “he won’t come up to you to-morrow morning.I saw him hesitate.He is deceiving you, my good friend.”"
"“我发誓他没有。”布朗洛先生温和地说道。","“I’ll swear he is not,” replied Mr. Brownlow, warmly."
"“如果不是的话，”格林维格先生的手杖又敲了一下，“我甘愿——”","“If he is not,” said Mr. Grimwig, “I’ll—” and down went the stick."
"“我拿我的生命担保，这个男孩子很诚实！”布朗洛先生说着，敲了敲桌子。","“I’ll answer for that boy’s truth with my life!” said Mr. Brownlow, knocking the table."
"“我拿我的脑袋担保，他说谎！”格林维格先生又说，也敲了下桌子。","“And I for his falsehood with my head!” rejoined Mr. Grimwig, knocking the table also."
"“那我们走着瞧吧，”布朗洛先生抑制住自己心中涌起的怒火，说道。","“We shall see,” said Mr. Brownlow, checking his rising anger."
"“我们会看到的，”格林维格先生脸上挂着气人的微笑，说道，“我们会看到的。”","“We will,” replied Mr. Grimwig, with a provoking smile; “we will.”"
"就像命中注定一样，这时候，贝德温太太送来一小包书，这是布朗洛先生早上从之前提到的那位书摊老板那里买的。她把书放在桌子上，准备离开。","As fate would have it, Mrs. Bedwin chanced to bring in, at this moment, a small parcel of books, which Mr. Brownlow had that morning purchased of the identical bookstall-keeper, who has already figured in this history; having laid them on the table, she prepared to leave the room."
"“叫送书的孩子等一等，贝德温太太！”布朗洛先生说，“有东西要让他带回去。”","“Stop the boy, Mrs. Bedwin!” said Mr. Brownlow; “there is something to go back.”"
"“他已经走了，先生。”贝德温太太答道。","“He has gone, sir,” replied Mrs. Bedwin."
"“把他叫回来，”布朗洛先生说，“这人也真是的。他本来就不富裕，这些书都没付钱呢。还有几本书也要送回去。”","“Call after him,” said Mr. Brownlow; “it’s a particular.He is a poor man, and they are not paid for.There are some books to be taken back, too.”"
"大门打开了。奥利弗和女仆分两路追了出去，贝德温太太站在台阶上，大声喊着送书来的男孩，但是连个人影也没有看到。奥利弗和女仆回来了，累得气喘吁吁。他们告诉布朗洛先生不知道那个送书人跑到哪里去了。","The street-door was opened.Oliver ran one way; and the girl ran another; and Mrs. Bedwin stood on the step and screamed for the boy; but there was no boy in sight.Oliver and the girl returned, in a breathless state, to report that there were no tidings of him."
"“天哪，真是太遗憾了，”布朗洛先生大叫，“这些书今天晚上能送回去该多好啊。”","“Dear me, I am very sorry for that,” exclaimed Mr. Brownlow; “I particularly wished those books to be returned to-night.”"
"“让奥利弗去送，”格林维格先生带着讽刺的微笑说道，“你知道的，他会平安送到的。”","“Send Oliver with them,” said Mr. Grimwig, with an ironical smile; “he will be sure to deliver them safely, you know.”"
"“是啊，先生，如果你愿意的话，就让我送去吧，”奥利弗说，“我会一路跑过去的，先生。”","“Yes; do let me take them, if you please, sir,” said Oliver.“I’ll run all the way, sir.”"
"布朗洛先生刚要开口说，奥利弗是无论如何也不能外出的。就在这时，格林维格先生发出一声咳嗽，充满了恶意。这使得布朗洛先生下定决心让奥利弗跑一趟，等他迅速完成了任务，起码自己就可以向格林维格先生证明，他的猜疑是不公正的，而且是可以立马澄清的。","The old gentleman was just going to say that Oliver should not go out on any account; when a most malicious cough from Mr. Grimwig determined him that he should; and that, by his prompt discharge of the commission, he should prove to him the injustice of his suspicions: on this head at least: at once."
"“你去吧，我亲爱的孩子，”老绅士说道，“书在我桌子旁边的椅子上。去把它们拿下来。”","“You shall go, my dear,” said the old gentleman.“The books are on a chair by my table.Fetch them down.”"
"奥利弗很开心，因为自己能做点事情了。他把书夹在胳膊底下，匆匆下了楼。他手里拿着帽子，等候吩咐。","Oliver, delighted to be of use, brought down the books under his arm in a great bustle; and waited, cap in hand, to hear what message he was to take."
"“你就说，”布朗洛先生目不转睛地盯着格林维格说道，“你就说你是来送还这些书的，同时把我欠他的四镑十先令交给他。这是一张五镑的钞票，你得把找的十先令带回来。","“You are to say,” said Mr. Brownlow, glancing steadily at Grimwig; “you are to say that you have brought those books back; and that you have come to pay the four pound ten I owe him.This is a five-pound note, so you will have to bring me back, ten shillings change.”"
"“我不出十分钟就回来，先生。”奥利弗急切地说。他把那张钞票放进了外套口袋里，扣上了扣子，小心地把书夹在胳膊底下，礼貌地鞠了一躬，离开了房间。贝德温太太跟着他走到了大门口，嘱咐了几句，告诉他最近的路怎么走，书摊老板的名字是什么，以及街道的名字，等等。奥利弗说一切他都清楚。老太太又说了好多注意事项，告诫他路上小心，不要着凉，这才让他离开。","“I won’t be ten minutes, sir,” said Oliver, eagerly.Having buttoned up the bank-note in his jacket pocket, and placed the books carefully under his arm, he made a respectful bow, and left the room.Mrs. Bedwin followed him to the street-door, giving him many directions about the nearest way, and the name of the bookseller, and the name of the street: all of which Oliver said he clearly understood.Having superadded many injunctions to be sure and not take cold, the old lady at length permitted him to depart."
"“看在他那张漂亮脸蛋的份上，保佑他吧！”老太太一直看着他的背影，说道，“无论怎样，我真不放心他走到我的视线之外。”","“Bless his sweet face!” said the old lady, looking after him.“I can’t bear, somehow, to let him go out of my sight.”"
"这时，奥利弗欢快地回头看了看，点点头，转过了街角。老太太笑着还了个礼，关上了大门，回到自己的房间。","At this moment, Oliver looked gaily round, and nodded before he turned the corner.The old lady smilingly returned his salutation, and, closing the door, went back to her own room."
"“我看，他最多二十分钟就会回来。”布朗洛先生边说边把手表掏出来放到桌子上，“到那时天也快黑了。”","“Let me see; he’ll be back in twenty minutes, at the longest,” said Mr. Brownlow, pulling out his watch, and placing it on the table.“It will be dark by that time.”"
"“哎哟！你真以为他会回来啊，是不是？”格林维格先生问。","“Oh! you really expect him to come back, do you?” inquired Mr. Grimwig."
"“你不这样认为吗？”布朗洛先生笑着反问。","“Don’t you?” asked Mr. Brownlow, smiling."
"此刻，存心找茬的劲头在格林维格先生心中本来就很强烈，看到朋友那自信的脸，他更加来劲了。","The spirit of contradiction was strong in Mr. Grimwig’s breast, at the moment; and it was rendered stronger by his friend’s confident smile."
"“是的，”他边说边用拳头捶了一下桌子，说道，“我不这样认为。他穿着一身新衣服，胳膊底下夹着些值钱的书，口袋里还有张五镑的钞票。他会回到他那帮小偷朋友那儿，反过来笑话你的。先生，要是那个孩子能回来的话，我就把我的脑袋吃下去。”","“No,” he said, smiting the table with his fist, “I do not.The boy has a new suit of clothes on his back, a set of valuable books under his arm, and a five-pound note in his pocket.He’ll join his old friends the thieves, and laugh at you.If ever that boy returns to this house, sir, I’ll eat my head.”"
"说着这些话，他把椅子往桌旁拉了拉。两个朋友一言不发地坐在那里，各怀心事，表放在他们之间。","With these words he drew his chair closer to the table; and there the two friends sat, in silent expectation, with the watch between them."
"为了说明我们是多么看重自己作出的判断，以及我们作出一些鲁莽草率的结论时是多么骄傲自负，值得注意的是：尽管格林维格先生绝非心肠恶毒之人，看着自己的朋友被骗也会真心地感到难过，但是，此时此刻，他发自肺腑地希望奥利弗不要回来。","It is worthy of remark, as illustrating the importance we attach to our own judgments, and the pride with which we put forth our most rash and hasty conclusions, that,although Mr. Grimwig was not by any means a bad-hearted man, and though he would have been unfeignedly sorry to see his respected friend duped and deceived, he really did most earnestly and strongly hope at that moment, that Oliver Twist might not come back."
"天色已经暗下来了，表刻度盘上的数字也几乎难以辨认了。两位老先生依旧是一声不响地坐在那儿，表放在他们之间。","It grew so dark, that the figures on the dial-plate were scarcely discernible; but there the two old gentlemen continued to sit, in silence, with the watch between them."
"第十五章 对快活的犹太佬和南希小姐是何等喜爱奥利弗·特威斯特的描述","CHAPTER XV Showing how very fond of Oliver Twist, the merry old jew and miss nancy were "
"在小红花山最肮脏的地段，有一家下等酒吧，酒吧内十分昏暗。在冬天，这里从早到晚都点着一盏火焰摇曳的煤气灯。即便是在夏天，这个黑暗阴森的洞穴内也是没有丝毫阳光的。酒吧里坐着一个汉子。他穿一身棉绒外套、黄褐色马裤，半长筒靴内穿着长袜。他正守着面前的白镴小酒壶和小玻璃杯，一个人喝着酒，浑身上下散发着浓浓酒气。即便是毫无经验的警察，凭借这十分昏暗的灯光，也能毫不迟疑地认出这就是威廉·赛克斯。他脚边趴着一只白毛红眼狗，它时而抬起两眼同时冲主人眨眨，时而又舔舔嘴角的大伤口，这伤口显然是从最近一次战斗中刚刚获得的。","In the obscure parlour of a low public-house, in the filthiest part of Little Saffron Hill; a dark and gloomy den, where a flaring gas-light burnt all day in the winter-time; and where no ray of sun ever shone in the summer:there sat, brooding over a little pewter measure and a small glass, strongly impregnated with the smell of liquor, a man in a velveteen coat, drab shorts, half-boots and stockings, whom even by that dim light no experienced agent of the police would have hesitated to recognise as Mr. William Sikes.At his feet, sat a white-coated, red-eyed dog; who occupied himself, alternately, in winking at his master with both eyes at the same time; and in licking a large, fresh cut on one side of his mouth, which appeared to be the result of some recent conflict."
"“安静点，你这狗东西！别给我出声！”赛克斯先生突然打破了沉寂。不知是因为他思索得太认真以至于狗眨几下眼也打扰到了他，还是因为情绪受到思想推动，需要踢一脚这无辜的畜生来释放，这个问题还有待讨论。不管原因究竟是什么，结果就是这个畜生同时挨了一脚和一顿臭骂。","“Keep quiet, you warmint!Keep quiet!” said Mr. Sikes, suddenly breaking silence.Whether his meditations were so intense as to be disturbed by the dog’s winking, or whether his feelings were so wrought upon by his reflections that they required all the relief derivable from kicking an unoffending animal to allay them, is matter for argument and consideration.Whatever was the cause, the effect was a kick and a curse, bestowed upon the dog simultaneously."
"通常，狗对主人的打骂是不会报复的。可是赛克斯先生的这只狗，脾气却跟它的主人一样坏。此时此刻，可能是感觉受到了莫大的侮辱，它没费什么劲，一口咬住主人的一只半长筒靴。它使劲摇了两下，然后咆哮着缩回长凳下面，正好躲过了赛克斯先生冲它脑袋砸过来的白镴酒壶。","Dogs are not generally apt to revenge injuries inflicted upon them by their masters; but Mr. Sikes’s dog, having faults of temper in common with his owner, and labouring, perhaps, at this moment, under a powerful sense of injury, made no more ado but at once fixed his teeth in one of the half-boots.Having given in a hearty shake, he retired, growling, under a form; just escaping the pewter measure which Mr. Sikes levelled at his head."
"“你敢咬我，你敢咬我？”赛克斯先生说着，操起一把火钳，另一只手从口袋里掏出一把折叠刀，从容不迫地打开。“过来啊，你这个天生的恶魔！过来！你聋了吗？”","“You would, would you?” said Sikes, seizing the poker in one hand, and deliberately opening with the other a large clasp-knife, which he drew from his pocket.“Come here, you born devil!Come here!D’ye hear?”"
"狗当然听到了，因为赛克斯声音相当刺耳而且音调极高。然而它显然对喉咙上挨一刀有说不出的反对，于是它依旧呆在原来的位置，只是叫得更加凶猛了。同时，它呲牙咬住火钳一端，如同一头疯狂的野兽。这种抵抗只能进一步激怒赛克斯先生，他双膝跪下，开始向这头畜生展开了最为猛烈的进攻。狗从右面跳到左面，又从左面跳到右面，啃咬着，咆哮着，狂叫着。这个汉子又戳又刺，一边打一边咒骂。这场较量对双方来说都进入了最至关重要的时刻。就在这时，门突然开了，狗立即丢下手持火钳和折叠刀的比尔·赛克斯，冲了出去。","The dog no doubt heard; because Mr. Sikes spoke in the very harshest key of a very harsh voice; but, appearing to entertain some unaccountable objection to having his throat cut, he remained where he was, and growled more fiercely than before: at the same time grasping the end of the poker between his teeth, and biting at it like a wild beast. This resistance only infuriated Mr. Sikes the more; who, dropping on his knees, began to assail the animal most furiously.The dog jumped from right to left, and from left to right; snapping, growling, and barking; the man thrust and swore, and struck and blasphemed; and the struggle was reaching a most critical point for one or other; when, the door suddenly opening, the dog darted out: leaving Bill Sikes with the poker and the clasp-knife in his hands."
"俗话说一个巴掌拍不响，吵架总得有双方才行。赛克斯先生见狗中途逃跑，非常失望，立马把对狗的怒气转移到刚进来的这个人身上。","There must always be two parties to a quarrel, says the old adage.Mr. Sikes, being disappointed of the dog’s participation, at once transferred his share in the quarrel to the new comer."
"“该死的，你掺和到我跟我那畜生中间干什么？”赛克斯凶巴巴地说道。","“What the devil do you come in between me and my dog for?” daid Sikes, with a fierce gesture."
"“我不知道，亲爱的先生，我一点也不知道，”费金谦卑地回答——来者正是犹太佬。","“I didn’t know, my dear, I didn’t know,” replied Fagin, humbly; for the Jew was the new comer."
"“你不知道！做贼心虚！”赛克斯怒吼道，“你没听到喧闹声吗？”","“Didn’t know, you white-livered thief!” growled Sikes.“Couldn’t you hear the noise?”"
"“一点声音也没有，比尔，我发誓。”老犹太回答。","“Not a sound of it, as I’m a living man, Bill,” replied the Jew."
"“喔，是的。你什么也没听见，你没听见。”赛克斯冷笑着反驳道，“偷偷摸摸地进出，所以没有人听见你是怎么来去的！费金，半分钟之前，你要是那条狗该多好。”","“Oh no!You hear nothing, you don’t,” retorted Sikes with a fierce sneer.“Sneaking in and out, so as nobody hears how you come or go!I wish you had been the dog, Fagin, half a minute ago.”"
"“为什么？”费金强挤出一丝笑容，问道。","“Why?” inquired the Jew with a forced smile."
"“因为政府虽然重视你这种人的小命，可它才不管一个人怎么为了高兴杀一个畜生，况且你的勇气还赶不上这畜生的一半呢。”赛克斯边回答，边意味深长地把刀合上，“这就是原因。”","“Cause the government, as cares for the lives of such men as you, as haven’t half the pluck of curs, lets a man kill a dog how he likes,” replied Sikes, shutting up the knife with a very expressive look; “that’s why.”"
"犹太佬搓着手，坐到桌子旁边，对朋友这番玩笑装模作样地笑了笑。但是，他心里显然正烦着呢。","The Jew rubbed his hands; and, sitting down at the table, affected to laugh at the pleasantry of his friend.He was obviously very ill at ease, however."
"“一边笑去。”赛克斯说着，把火钳放回原处，带着赤裸裸的鄙视打量着他，“一边笑去。轮不到你来笑话我，除非是晚上喝了点小酒后。费金，跟你比，我始终占上风，我他妈的会一直这样。听着！要是我完了，你也就完了。所以你给我当心点。”","“Grin away,” said Sikes, replacing the poker, and surveying him with savage contempt; “grin away.You’ll never have the laugh at me, though, unless it’s behind a nightcap.I’ve got the upper hand over you, Fagin; and, d—me, I’ll keep it.There!If I go, you go; so take care of me.”"
"“好的，好的，亲爱的先生，”犹太佬说道，“我都明白。我们——我们的利益本来就是牵连在一起的，比尔——牵连在一起的。”","“Well, well, my dear,” said the Jew, “I know all that; we—we—have a mutual interest, Bill,—a mutual interest.”"
"“哼，”赛克斯似乎觉得老犹太得到的好处远比自己多，“得了吧，你有什么要告诉我的？”","“Humph,” said Sikes, as if he thought the interest lay rather more on the Jew’s side than on his.“Well, what have you got to say to me?”"
"“事情总算是有惊无险，”费金回答，“你的一份我给你带来了。比你应得的多了很多，亲爱的，不过我知道，下次你也不会亏待我，再说——”“少来那一套，”那强盗不耐烦地打断了他的话，“在哪儿呢？拿来！”","“It’s all passed safe through the melting-pot,” replied Fagin, “and this is your share.It’s rather more than it ought to be, my dear; but as I know you’ll do me a good turn another time, and—” “Stow that gammon,” interposed the robber, impatiently.“Where is it?Hand over!”"
"“行，行，比尔，别着急，别着急，”费金安抚地说道，“这儿呢！分文不少！”说着，他从怀里掏出一块旧棉布手帕，解开角上的一个大结，取出一个棕色小纸包。赛克斯一把夺过了纸包，连忙打开来，着手数里面的金币。","“Yes, yes, Bill; give me time, give me time,” replied the Jew, soothingly.“Here it is!All safe!”As he spoke, he drew forth an old cotton handkerchief from his breast; and untying a large knot in one corner, produced a small brown-paper packet.Sikes, snatching it from him, hastily opened it; and proceeded to count the sovereigns it contained."
"“就这些，是吗？”赛克斯问。","“This is all, is it?” inquired Sikes."
"“全在这儿了。”犹太佬回答。","“All,” replied the Jew."
"“一路上你没打开这个包，将其中一两个占为己有？”赛克斯怀疑地问道，“别装出一副受伤的样子，这事你可不是做了一次两次了。拉一下铃。”","“You haven’t opened the parcel and swallowed one or two as you come along, have you?” inquired Sikes, suspiciously.“Don’t put on an injured look at the question; you’ve done it many a time.Jerk the tinkler.”"
"说得明白些，就是他下达了拉铃的命令。铃声唤来了另一个犹太人。他比费金年轻一些，但是外表与费金一样令人讨厌。","These words, in plain English, conveyed an injunction to ring the bell.It was answered by another Jew: younger than Fagin, but nearly as vile and repulsive in appearance."
"比尔·赛克斯只是指了指空酒瓶。犹太人完全明白了这一暗示，退出去盛酒去了。离开之前，他和费金交换了一个不同寻常的眼神。费金抬了抬头，好像正在等着他的眼神一样，又摇了摇头作为回答。他的动作极其不明显，所以即使第三个人观察力非常敏锐，也几乎无法察觉。赛克斯此时正在弯腰系那被狗撕开的靴子带，他一点儿也没察觉到费金的动作。如果他察觉的话，可能会将两人之间交换的暗号当成一个不祥之兆。","Bill Sikes merely pointed to the empty measure.The Jew, perfectly understanding the hint, retired to fill it: previously exchanging a remarkable look with Fagin, who raised his eyes for an instant, as if in expectation of it, and shook his head in reply; so slightly that the action would have been almost imperceptible to an observant third person.It was lost upon Sikes, who was stooping at the moment to tie the boot-lace which the dog had torn.Possibly, if he had observed the brief interchange of signals, he might have thought that it boded no good to him."
"“这儿有人吗，巴尼？”费金问道，低着头盯着地面，这时赛克斯已经抬起头来。","“Is anybody here, Barney?” inquired Fagin; speaking, now that that Sikes was looking on, without raising his eyes from the ground."
"“一个人也没有。”巴尼回答。不管他的话是否发自内心，总之它们是打鼻子里出来的。","“Dot a shoul,” replied Barney; whose words: whether they came from the heart or not: made their way through the nose."
"“没有人？”费金的语气中充满了惊讶，也许他的意思是暗示巴尼不妨讲实话。","“Nobody?” inquired Fagin, in a tone of surprise: which perhaps might mean that Barney was at liberty to tell the truth."
"“除了达基小姐，没有别人。”巴尼回答。","“Dobody but Biss Dadsy,” replied Barney."
"“南希！”赛克斯叫起来，“她在哪里？这姑娘真是天才。我要是说假话的话，就让我瞎了。”","“Nancy!” exclaimed Sikes.“Where?Strike me blind, if I don’t honour that’ere girl, for her native talents.”"
"“她在吧台点了一盘煮牛肉。”巴尼回答。","“She’s bid havid a plate of boiled beef id the bar,” replied Barney."
"“让她过来，”赛克斯边说边斟了一杯酒，“让她过来。”","“Send her here,” said Sikes, pouring out a glass of liquor.“Send her here.”"
"巴尼胆怯地看了看费金，似乎是在请求他的允许。犹太佬依旧沉默，眼睛盯着地板。巴尼离开了，没过一会儿，领着南希回来了。这姑娘依旧带着无边软帽，围着围裙，手里拿着篮子和大门钥匙，这些东西一件不少。","Barney looked timidly at Fagin, as if for permission; the Jew remaining silent, and not lifting his eyes from the ground, he retired; and presently returned, ushering in Nancy; who was decorated with the bonnet, apron, basket, and street-door key, complete."
"“你找到线索了，是不是，南希？”赛克斯边问，边把酒杯递了过去。","“You are on the scent, are you, Nancy?” inquired Sikes, proffering the glass."
"“是的，比尔，我找到了，”年轻小姐把杯里的酒一饮而尽，答道，“真把我累得够呛。那个小孩子病了，下不了床——”“噢，南希，亲爱的。”费金抬起头来说道。","“Yes, I am, Bill,” replied the young lady, disposing of its contents; “and tired enough of it I am, too.The young brat’s been ill and confined to the crib; and—” “Ah, Nancy, dear!” said Fagin, looking up."
"当时，费金先生红色的眉毛紧皱，深陷的双眸微闭。他是不是在向话说得太多了的南希发出警告，这并不重要。我们需要注意的是以下事实：南希突然打住，向赛克斯先生亲昵地笑了一下，开始谈论起别的事情。过了大约十分钟，费金先生使劲咳嗽了几声，南希见他这副模样，便用围巾围住肩膀，说她该走了。赛克斯先生意识到自己与她有一段同路，说愿意陪她一起走，两人便一起走了。那只狗在不远处跟着。主人刚走出视野，狗就从后门溜走了。","Now, whether a peculiar contraction of the Jew’s red eye-brows, and a half closing of his deeply-set eyes, warned Miss Nancy that she was disposed to be too communicative, is not a matter of much importance.The fact is all we need care for here; and the fact is, that she suddenly checked herself, and with several gracious smiles upon Mr. Sikes, turned the conversation to other matters.In about ten minutes’ time, Mr. Fagin was seized with a fit of coughing; upon which Nancy pulled her shawl over her shoulders, and declared it was time to go.Mr. Sikes, finding that he was walking a short part of her way himself, expressed his intention of accompanying her; they went away together, followed, at a little distant, by the dog, who slunk out of a back-yard as soon as his master was out of sight."
"赛克斯离开后，费金从屋门口探出头去，看着他走上漆黑的大道。费金先是握紧拳头晃了两下，低声骂了两句，然后又发出几声可怕的笑，重新坐到桌旁来。没过多久，就被一份《通缉令》有趣的版面深深吸引住了。","The Jew thrust his head out of the room door when Sikes had left it; looked after him as we walked up the dark passage; shook his clenched fist; muttered a deep curse; and then, with a horrible grin, reseated himself at the table; where he was soon deeply absorbed in the interesting pages of the Hue-and-Cry."
"与此同时，奥利弗·特威斯特正在去书摊的路上。他根本没有料到自己跟那位快活的老先生相隔咫尺。走进克拉肯韦尔街区后，他不小心稍稍走偏了一点，拐进了一条胡同，走了一半才发现错了。他知道这个胡同方向是对的，于是心想用不着折回去。他继续快步向前，依旧把书夹在胳膊底下。","Meanwhile, Oliver Twist, little dreaming that he was within so very short a distance of the merry old gentleman, was on his way to the book-stall.When he got into Clerkenwell, he accidently turned down a by-street which was not exactly in his way; but not discovering his mistake until he had got half-way down it, and knowing it must lead in the right direction, he did not think it worth while to turn back; and so marched on, as quickly as he could, with the books under his arm."
"他边走边想，要能见一眼可怜的小迪克，他该感到多么高兴与满足啊！那样的话，无论付出多大的代价都行。迪克还在挨打受饿，这会儿说不定正在悲伤地抹眼泪呢。就在这时，一个年轻女子大声尖叫起来，把他吓了一大跳。“哎呦，我亲爱的弟弟！”他还没来得及抬头看清楚是怎么回事，便被伸过来的两只胳膊紧紧环住脖子，使得他停住了脚步。","He was walking along, thinking how happy and contented he ought to feel; and how much he would give for only one look at poor little Dick, who, starved and beaten, might be weeping bitterly at that very moment; when he was startled by a young woman screaming out very loud.“Oh, my dear brother!”And he had hardly looked up, to see what the matter was, when he was stopped by having a pair of arms thrown tight round his neck."
"“放手，”奥利弗大叫，努力想挣脱，“放开我。你是谁啊？你干吗拦住我？”","“Don’t,” cried Oliver, struggling.“Let go of me.Who is it?What are you stopping me for?”"
"搂住他的女子手里拎着一个篮子和一把大门钥匙；一大串高声哭喊就是对他唯一的回答。","The only reply to this, was a great number of loud lamentations from the young woman who had embraced him; and who had a little basket and a street-door key in her hand."
"“哎哟，天哪！”年轻女子叫道，“我可找到他了！噢！奥利弗！奥利弗！哎呦，你这个淘气的孩子，为了你，我吃了多少苦头！跟我回家，亲爱的，走啊。噢，我可找到他了。谢天谢地，我可找到他了！”年轻女子语无伦次地叫喊了一通，然后又一次放声大哭起来。她是如此歇斯底里，让人害怕，以至于两个路过的女人问一个头发油光锃亮的肉店伙计，他是不是该跑去把医生喊过来。肉店伙计即使不是个懒鬼，也是那种游手好闲的人。他回答说他认为没有必要。","“Oh my gracious!” said the young woman, “I have found him!Oh!Oliver!Oliver!Oh you naughty boy, to make me suffer such distress on your account!Come home, dear, come.Oh, I’ve found him.Thank gracious goodness heavins, I’ve  found him!”With these incoherent exclamations, the young woman burst into another fit of crying, and got so dreadfully hysterical, that a couple of women who came up at the moment asked a butcher’s boy with a shiny head of hair anointed with suet, who was also looking on, whether he didn’t think he had better run for the doctor.To which, the butcher’s boy: who appeared of a lounging, not to say indolent disposition: replied, that he thought not."
"“哦，不用，不用，不要紧，”年轻女子拉住奥利弗的手说道，“我现在好多了。现在就跟我回家去！你这个没良心的孩子！走啊！”“太太，什么事？”一个妇女问道。“噢，太太，”年轻女子回答，“差不多一个月前，他从他爸爸妈妈那儿跑了。他们可都是辛勤工作、受人尊重的人。他跑去跟一群小偷混蛋混在了一起，他妈妈心都快碎了。”","“Oh, no, no, never mind,” said the young woman, grasping Oliver’s hand; “I’m better now.Come home directly, you cruel boy!Come!”“What’s the matter, ma’ma?” inquired one of the women.“Oh, ma’am,” replied the young woman, “he ran away, near a month ago, from his parents, who are hard-working and respectable people; and went and joined a set of thieves and bad characters; and almost broke his mother’s heart.”"
"“小混蛋！”一个妇女说道。","“Young wretch!” said one woman."
"“回家去，快点，你这个小畜生。”另一个说。","“Go home, do, you little brute,” said the other."
"“我不，”奥立弗吓坏了，回答道，“我根本不认识她。我没有姐姐，也没有爸爸妈妈。我是个孤儿，我住在本顿维尔。”","“I am not,” replied Oliver, greatly alarmed.“I don’t know her.I haven’t any sister, or father and mother either.I’m an orphan; I live at Pentonville.”"
"“你们快听听，他还嘴硬！”年轻女子叫道。","“Only hear him, how he braves it out!” cried the young woman."
"“哎呀，是南希！”奥利弗叫起来。他这才看清楚她的脸，不由地往后退了退。","“Why, it’s Nancy!” exclaimed Oliver; who now saw her face for the first time; and started back, in irrepressible astonishment."
"“你们瞧，他认识我！”南希向周围的人高呼，“他自己也骗不过去了。哪位好心人，让他回家吧。不然的话，他真的会把他爸妈气死，然后让我也心碎的！”","“You see he knows me!” cried Nancy, appealing to the bystanders.“He can’t help himself.Make him come home, there’s good people, or he’ll kill his dear mother and father, and break my heart!”"
"“这到底是怎么回事啊？”一个男子从一家酒吧奔了出来，一只白狗跟在他身后，“小奥利弗！快回到你那可怜的妈妈那儿去，你这个小兔崽子！现在就给我回家！”","“What the devil’s this?” said a man, bursting out of a beer-shop, with a white dog at his heels; “young Oliver!Come home to your poor mother, you young dog!Come home directly.”"
"“我不是他们家的。我不认识他们。救命，救命啊！”奥立弗叫喊道，在那个男人有力的怀抱里挣扎。","“I don’t belong to them.I don’t know them.Help! help!” cried Oliver, struggling in the man’s powerful grasp."
"“救命！”男人重复着奥立弗的话，“没错，我会救你的，你这个小坏蛋！","“Help!” repeated the man.“Yes; I’ll help you, you young rascal!"
"这是什么书啊？一定是你偷来的吧，是不是？把书拿过来。”说着，这个男人夺过了奥利弗手里的书，敲了敲他的脑袋。","What books are these?You’ve been a stealing ’em, have you?Give ’em here.”With these words, the man tore the volumes from his grasp, and struck him on the head."
"“干得好！”一个看热闹的人从一扇阁楼窗户里冲外喊道，“只有这样才能让他清醒过来！”","“That’s right!” cried a looker-on, from a garret-window.“That’s the only way of bringing him to his senses!”"
"“没错！”另一个睡眼朦胧的木匠喊道，冲着阁楼窗户投去了赞同的目光。","“To be sure!” cried a sleepy-faced carpenter, casting an approving look at the garret-window."
"“这对他有好处！”那两个妇女说道。","“It’ll do him good!” said the two women."
"“而且他这是罪有应得！”那个男人应和道，又给了奥利弗一下，并一把抓住了他的衣领。“走啊，你这个小恶棍！牛眼儿，过来。看着他，伙计！看着他！”","“And he shall have it, too!” rejoined the man, administering another blow, and seizing Oliver by the collar.“Come on, you young villain!Here, Bull’s-eye, mind him, boy!Mind him!”"
"奥利弗本来就大病初愈，又被这突如其来的殴打和攻击弄得晕头转向。那只狂叫的狗是那么凶猛，那个男人是那么蛮横无理，再加上围观者认定他就是如大家表述的那么一个小坏蛋，他这个可怜的孩子，还有什么办法！夜色已经降临，这儿又不是一个讲理的地方，没有人能够帮助他，反抗显然是徒劳的。接着，他被拖进了一个由无数昏暗窄小的胡同组成的迷宫，被迫跟着他们一起极快地走着。这使他壮着胆子发出的呼喊声基本上无法被人听清了。确实，听得清听不清也无关紧要了。就算听明白了，也没有人会放心上的。","Weak with recent illness; stupified by the blows and the suddenness of the attack; terrified by the fierce growling of the dog, and the brutality of the man; overpowered by the conviction of the bystanders that he really was the hardened little wretch he was described to be; what could one poor child do!Darkness had set in; it was a low neighborhood; no help was near; resistance was useless.In another moment he was dragged into a labyrinth of dark narrow courts, and was forced along them at a pace which rendered the few cries he dared to give utterance to, unintelligible.It was of little moment, indeed, whether they were intelligible or no; for there was nobody to care for them, had they been ever so plain."
"煤气灯已经点亮了。贝德温太太焦急不安地守候在敞开的门口。仆人已经跑到街上二十多次去找奥利弗的踪迹。客厅里没有点灯，一片漆黑，两位老绅士依旧正襟危坐，那块表放在他们之间。","The gas-lamps were lighted; Mrs. Bedwin was waiting anxiously at the open door; the servant had run up the street twenty times to see if there were any traces of Oliver; and still the two old gentlemen sat, perseveringly, in the dark parlour, with the watch between them."
"第十六章 对奥利弗·特威斯特被南希领走之后情况的叙述","CHAPTER XVI Relates what became of Oliver Twist, after he had been claimed by Nancy  "
"狭窄的街道和院落最终在一片宽敞空地到了尽头。空地四下里是一些关牲口的围栏，说明这里是个牲口交易市场。走到这儿，赛克斯放慢了步子。一路上疾走，南希已经支撑不住了。赛克斯转向奥利弗，粗暴地命令他扶住南希的手。","The narrow streets and courts, at length, terminated in a large open space; scattered about which, were pens for beasts, and other indications of a cattle-market.Sikes slackened his pace when they reached this spot: the girl being quite unable to support any longer, the rapid rate at which they had hitherto walked.Turning to Oliver, he roughly commanded him to take hold of Nancy’s hand."
"“你听见没有？”赛克斯见奥利弗犹犹豫豫，东张西望，就冲他怒吼道。","“Do you hear?” growled Sikes, as Oliver hesitated, and looked round."
"他们身处一个黑暗的角落里，四周没有什么行人。","They were in a dark corner, quite out of the track of passengers."
"奥利弗很明白自己的处境，抵抗是完全没有用的。他伸出手，立刻被南希紧紧地握住了。","Oliver saw, but too plainly, that resistance would be of no avail.He held out his hand, which Nancy clasped tight in hers."
"“把另一只手给我。”赛克斯说着，抓住奥利弗空着的那只手。“过来，牛眼儿！”","“Give me the other,” said Sikes, seizing Oliver’s unoccupied hand.“Here, Bull’s—Eye!”"
"那只狗抬了抬头，嗥叫了几声。","The dog looked up, and growled."
"“看这儿，乖乖！”赛克斯说着，用另一只手指着奥利弗的喉咙，“哪怕他敢吭一声，就咬他！明白了吗？”","“See here, boy!” said Sikes, putting his other hand to Oliver’s throat; “if he speaks ever so soft a word, hold him!D’ye mind!”"
"狗又叫了起来。它舔了舔嘴唇，两眼放着光，恶狠狠地盯着奥利弗，彷佛是要立马咬断他的气管似的。","The dog growled again; and licking his lips, eyed Oliver as if he were anxious to attach himself to his windpipe without delay."
"“它还真是跟基督教徒一样听话呢。如果它不是的话，就让我瞎了吧。”赛克斯瞅着这头畜生，带着几分冷酷与残忍地称赞道。“喂，先生，这下你知道会有什么结果了吧。你愿意喊就喊吧，这狗立马就会结束你这小把戏的。小家伙，跟上！”","“He’s as willing as a Christian, strike me blind if he isn’t!” said Sikes, regarding the animal with a kind of grim and ferocious apporval.“Now, you know what you’ve got to expect, master, so call away as quick as you like; the dog will soon stop that game.Get on, young’un!”"
"牛眼儿摇了摇尾巴，对这一番罕见的夸奖表示感谢。它又叫了一通，算是对奥利弗进行警告，之后便跑到前面领路了。","Bull’s-eye wagged his tail in acknowledgment of this unusually endearing form of speech; and, giving vent to another admonitory growl for the benefit of Oliver, led the way onward."
"他们穿过的这片空地是伦敦肉市场，不过或许也可能是格罗夫诺广场。反正奥利弗也不知道。夜色漆黑，大雾弥漫。店铺里的灯光几乎难以穿过这越来越厚的浓雾，街道、房屋全都被这朦胧黑暗笼罩着。这个陌生的地方在奥利弗眼里更加神秘了，他越发忐忑与沮丧。","It was Smithfield that they were crossing, although it might have been Grosvenor Square, for anything Oliver knew to the contrary.The night was dark and foggy.The lights in the shops could scarecely struggle through the heavy mist, which thickened every moment and shrouded the streets and houses in gloom; rendering the strange place still stranger in Oliver’s eyes; and making his uncertainty the more dismal and depressing."
"他们刚刚匆忙前进了几步，教堂深沉的钟声便开始报时了。伴随着第一声钟声，两个领路人都停了下来，不约而同地朝钟声传来的方向望去。","They had hurried on a few paces, when a deep church-bell struck the hour.With its first stroke, his two conductors stopped, and turned their heads in the direction whence the sound proceeded."
"“八点了，比尔。”钟声响完后，南希说道。","“Eight o’clock, Bill,” said Nancy, when the bell ceased."
"“用不着你说。我自己听得见！” 赛克斯回答。","“What’s the good of telling me that; I can hear it, can’t I!”replied Sikes. "
"“不知道他们是否听得见。”南希说。","“I wonder whether they can hear it,” said Nancy."
"“他们当然听得见。”赛克斯回答，“我进去的时候正好是巴多罗买节，没有什么是听不见的，就连集市上最便宜的小喇叭啪啦啪啦响我都能听见。晚上我被锁起来以后，外面的喧嚣吵闹使这个异常古老的监狱愈发沉寂，我差点没用自己的脑袋撞门上的铁板。”","“Of course they can,” replied Sikes.“It was Bartlemy time when I was shopped; and there warn’t a penny trumpet in the fair, as I couldn’t hear the squeaking on.Arter I was locked up for the night, the row and din outside made the thundering old jail so silent, that I could almost have beat my brains out against the iron plates of the door.”"
"“可怜的家伙！”南希说道，依旧面朝钟声传来的方向望着。“哎，比尔，那些漂亮的小伙子！”","“Poor fellow!” said Nancy, who still had her face turned towards the quarter in which the bell had sounded.“Oh, Bill, such fine young chaps as them!”"
"“是啊，你们女人家总是想这些。”赛克斯回答道，“漂亮的小伙子！唔，就当他们都死了好了。所以再漂亮也没啥用。”","“Yes; that’s all you women think of,” answered Sikes.“Fine young chaps!Well, they’re as good as dead, so it don’t much matter.”"
"赛克斯先生似乎想用这种聊以自慰的话语压住心头升腾起的嫉妒之火。他把奥利弗的手腕抓得更紧了，命令他继续往前走。","With this consolation, Mr. Sikes appeared to repress a rising tendency to jealousy, and, clasping Oliver’s wrist more firmly, told him to step out again."
"“等一下！”南希说道，“比尔，下次八点钟声敲响的时候，要是出来上绞刑台的是你，我也不匆匆离开了。我要在这个地方一圈一圈地转，直到我倒下去为止。哪怕满地积雪，哪怕我身上连一条围巾都没有。”","“Wait a minute!” said the girl: “I wouldn’t hurry by, if it was you that was coming out to be hung, the next time eight o’clock struck, Bill.I’d walk round and round the place till I dropped, if the snow was on the ground, and I hadn’t a shawl to cover me.”"
"“那有什么用呢?”赛克斯先生冷冷说道，“除非你能扔过去一把锉刀和一条二十码的结实绳子，否则你走五十英里也好，一步都不走也好，对我来说都是一样的。走吧，不要在那儿站着说些没用的了。”","“And what good would that do?” inquired the unsentimental Mr.Sikes. “Unless you could pitch over a file and twenty yards of good stout rope, you might as well be walking fifty mile off, or not walking at all, for all the good it would do me.Come on, and don’t stand preaching there.”"
"年轻姑娘扑哧一声笑了，紧紧裹了裹围巾。他们便一起出发了。但是，奥利弗感觉到她的手在颤抖。当他们走过一盏煤气街灯的时候，他抬起头，看到她的脸色死一般苍白。","The girl burst into a laugh; drew her shawl more closely round her; and they walked away.But Oliver felt her hand tremble, and, looking up in her face as they passed a gas-lamp, saw that it had turned a deadly white."
"他们继续沿着偏僻肮脏的小道往前走，足足走了半个小时。路上基本上没遇见什么人。唯一见到的几个人，社会地位跟赛克斯差不多，这点从他们的穿着打扮就能看出来。最后，他们拐进一条异常肮脏的小巷子。巷子里基本上都是卖旧衣服的铺子。那条狗似乎意识到在这里已经不需要自己戒备了，便一个劲儿往前跑开了，一直跑到一家铺子门口它才停下来。这家铺子大门紧锁，破陋不堪，显然无人租住。门上钉着一个板子，暗示这个房子打算往外出租；不过这板子看上去像是已经挂了好多年。","They walked on, by little-frequented and dirty ways, for a full half-hour: meeting very few people, and those appearing from their looks to hold much the same position in society as Mr. Sikes himself.At length they turned into a very filthy narrow street, nearly full of old-clothes shops; the dog running forward, as if conscious that there was no further occasion for his keeping on guard, stopped before the door of a shop that was closed and apparently untenanted; the house was in a ruinous condition, and on the door was nailed a board, intimating that it was to let: which looked as if it had hung there for many years."
"“到了。”赛克斯边说边小心谨慎地环视着四周。","“All right,” cried Sikes, glancing cautiously about."
"南希钻到百叶窗底下，接着奥利弗听到了一阵铃声。他们走到街对面，在一盏街灯下面站了一会儿。一个声音传了过来，就像是窗框轻轻抬起来的声音。然后房门轻轻地打开了。赛克斯先生毫不客气地抓起这个早已受到惊吓的男孩的衣领，三个人迅速地走进屋内。","Nancy stooped below the shutters, and Oliver heard the sound of a bell.They crossed to the opposite side of the street, and stood for a few moments under a lamp.A noise, as if a sash window were gently raised, was heard; and soon afterwards the door softly opened.Mr. Sikes then seized the terrified boy by the collar with very little ceremony; and all three were quickly inside the house."
"过道里伸手不见五指。领他们进屋的人在上门锁和门闩，他们三个停下脚步等待。","The passage was perfectly dark.They waited, while the person who had let them in, chained and barred the door."
"“有没有别的人？”赛克斯询问。","“Anybody here?”inquired Sikes. "
"“没有。”一个声音回答道。奥利弗觉得自己以前听到过这个声音。","“No,” replied a voice, which Oliver thought he had heard before."
"“那老家伙在吧？”这个强盗继续问。","“Is the old ’un here?” asked the robber."
"“嗯，”那个声音回答，“一直唉声叹气呢。他会乐意见到你吗？噢，不会的！”","“Yes,” replied the voice, “and precious down in the mouth he has been.Won’t he be glad to see you?Oh, no!”"
"这回话的风格，以及这声音，对奥利弗来说都很熟悉。可是黑暗中他根本就辨别不出说话人的轮廓。","The style of this reply, as well as the voice which delivered it, seemed familiar to Oliver’s ears: but it was impossible to distinguish even the form of the speaker in the darkness."
"“给点光吧，”赛克斯说，“要不我们会摔断脖子的，或者是踩到狗身上。那样的话，可得当心自己的腿！”","“Let’s have a glim,” said Sikes, “or we shall go breaking our necks, or treading on the dog.Look after your legs if you do!”"
"“你们等会儿，我去取。”这个声音回答。接着便听到那人离开的脚步声。一会儿，约翰·道金斯先生，也就是狡猾的机灵鬼出现了。他右手拿着一根有裂缝的木棍，木棍末端插着一根蜡烛。","“Stand still a moment, and I’ll get you one,” replied the voice.The receding footsteps of the speaker were heard; and, in another minute, the form of Mr. John Dawkins, otherwise the Artful Dodger, appeared.He bore in his right hand a tallow candle stuck in the end of a cleft stick."
"这个年轻绅士只是幽默地冲奥利弗笑了一下，算是打过招呼，并没有说任何话。然后他便转过身，示意来客跟着自己走下楼梯。他们穿过一个空空的厨房，走到一个充满泥土味的低矮屋子门前。这屋子像是建在房子后面的小院子里。一开门，一阵笑声传了过来。","The young gentleman did not stop to bestow any other mark of recognition upon Oliver than a humourous grin; but, turning away, beckoned the visitors to follow him down a flight of stairs.They crossed an empty kitchen; and, opening the door of a low earthy-smelling room, which seemed to have been built in a small back-yard, were received with a shout of laughter."
"“噢，笑死我了，笑死我了！”查利·贝茨少爷叫道，笑声就是从他肺里传出来的，“他在这儿呢！噢，他在这儿呢！噢，费金，你瞧他！费金，你好好看看！笑死我了，这个游戏太好玩了，笑死我了。谁来扶我一把，让我笑个够吧。”","“Oh, my wig, my wig!” cried Master Charles Bates, from whose lungs the laughter had proceeded: “here he is! oh, cry, here he is!Oh, Fagin, look at him!Fagin, do look at him!I can’t bear it; it is such a jolly game, I cant’s bear it.Hold me, somebody, while I laugh it out.”"
"带着这股抑制不住的高兴劲儿，贝茨少爷一屁股坐到地上，开心地又踢又蹬，折腾了足足五分钟。接着他跳了起来，从机灵鬼那儿抢过那根裂缝的木棍，走到奥利弗面前，绕着奥立弗看了又看。这时候，犹太佬摘下了睡帽，对着一脸迷惑的奥立弗连连深深鞠躬。机灵鬼性格一向阴沉。如果起哄对事情有妨碍的话，他很少跟着起哄。但是这时，他也极其认真地把奥利弗的衣服口袋搜刮了一遍。","With this irrepressible ebullition of mirth, Master Bates laid himself flat on the floor: and kicked convulsively for five minutes, in an ectasy of facetious joy.Then jumping to his feet, he snatched the cleft stick from the Dodger; and, advancing to Oliver, viewed him round and round; while the Jew, taking off his nightcap, made a great number of low bows to the bewildered boy.The Artful, meantime, who was of a rather saturnine disposition, and seldom gave way to merriment when it interfered with business, rifled Oliver’s pockets with steady assiduity."
"“瞧他这身打扮，费金！”查利说着，把灯靠得离奥立弗的新外套太近，差点就把它点着了。“瞧他这身打扮！上等的布料，一流的裁剪！哦，我的天啊，真不错！还有这书，真不错！简直就是一个小绅士，费金！”","“Look at his togs, Fagin!” said Charley, putting the light so close to his new jacket as nearly to set him on fire.“Look at his togs!Superfine cloth, and the heavy swell cut!Oh, my eye, what a game!And his books, too!Nothing but a gentleman, Fagin!”"
"“亲爱的，看到你脸色这么好，真叫人开心。”犹太佬佯装谦恭地欠身说道，“机灵鬼会给你另一套衣服，我亲爱的，省得你把应该礼拜天穿的衣服弄脏了。亲爱的，你来之前为什么不写信告诉我们呢？我们也好弄点热乎乎的东西当晚饭啊。”","“Delighted to see you looking so well, my dear,” said the Jew, bowing with mock humility.“The Artful shall give you another suit, my dear, for fear you should spoil that Sunday one.Why didn’t you write, my dear, and say you were coming?We’d have got something warm for supper.”"
"一听这话，贝茨少爷又大笑起来。他笑得是那么大声，费金心里也轻松了，机灵鬼也笑了。不过，由于机灵鬼在那时把那张五镑的钞票搜了出来，所以引发他笑的也可能是这一发现。","At his, Master Bates roared again: so loud, that Fagin himself relaxed, and even the Dodger smiled; but as the Artful drew forth the five-pound note at that instant, it is doubtful whether the sally of the discovery awakened his merriment."
"“喂，这是什么？”犹太佬刚一把夺过那张钞票，赛克斯就冲上前去问，“那是我的，费金。”","“Hallo, what’s that?” inquired Sikes, stepping forward as the Jew seized the note.“That’s mine, Fagin.”"
"“不，不，我亲爱的，”犹太佬说道，“是我的，比尔，我的。那些书归你了。”","“No, no, my dear,” said the Jew.“Mine, Bill, mine.You shall have the books.”"
"“怎么会不是我的呢！”比尔·赛克斯说着，神色坚定地把帽子戴上，“这是我跟南希两个人的，要不我会把这个孩子送回去的。”","“If that isn’t mine!” said Bill Sikes, putting on his hat with a determined air; “mine and Nancy’s that is; I’ll take the boy back again.”"
"犹太佬吓了一跳。奥利弗也吓了一跳，然而却是出于完全不同的原因。他希望这场争吵能真的以他被送回去而收场。","The Jew started.Oliver started too, though from a very different cause; for he hoped that the dispute might really end in his being taken back."
"“快！交出来，你交还不是不交？”赛克斯说道。","“Come! Hand over, will you?” said Sikes."
"“这不公平，比尔。太不公平，不是吗，南希？”犹太佬问道。","“This is hardly fair, Bill; hardly fair, is it, Nancy?”inquired the Jew."
"“什么公平不公平的，”赛克斯反驳道，“交出来，我告诉你！你以为我跟南希牺牲了宝贵的时间，除了当探子把这个从你手中溜走的孩子带回来，就没有别的事情可做了吗？拿过来，你这个老不死的贪婪鬼，给我拿过来！”","“Fair,or not,”retorted Sikes,“hand over, I tell you!Do you think Nancy and me has got nothing else to do with our precious time but to spend it in scouting arter, and kidnapping, every young boy as gets grabbed through you?Give it here, you avaricious old skeleton, give it here!”"
"随着这一番温和的劝诫，赛克斯先生把钞票从犹太佬手指尖抢了过去，然后冷冷地盯着这个老头，把钞票折小后，塞在围巾里。","With this gentle remonstrance, Mr. Sikes plucked the note from between the Jew’s finger and thumb; and looking the old man coolly in the face, folded it up small, and tied it in his neckerchief."
"“这是我们应得的报酬，”赛克斯说道，“其实这连一半都不够呢。你要是喜欢读书，就把这些书留着吧。要是你不喜欢，卖了也行。”","“That’s for our share of the trouble,” said Sikes; “and not half enough, neither.You may keep the books, if you’re fond of reading.If you ain’t, sell ’em.”"
"“这些书还真不错呢，”查利·贝茨做着各种鬼脸说道，他还装模作样地读其中的一本书，“写得真不错，是不是啊，奥利弗？”看到奥利弗没精打采地盯着这些折磨他的人，本来就爱开玩笑的贝茨少爷又一次狂笑起来，笑得比刚开始那次还欢。“这些书是那位老先生的，”奥利弗绞着双手说道，“就是那位善良好心的老先生。他在我得了热病差点死了的时候把我带到了他家里，让我得到了很好的照顾。嗯，求求你们了，把它们送回去吧。把这些书跟钱都给他送回去吧。你们要我一辈子留在这儿都行。但是求求你们了，把这些东西统统送回去吧。他会认为是我把它们偷走了的。还有那位老太太，对我那么好，她也会以为是我偷的。天哪，可怜可怜我吧，把它们送回去吧！”","“They’re very pretty,” said Charley Bates: who, with sundry grimaces, had been affecting to read one of the volumes in question; “beautiful writing, isn’t is, Oliver?”At sight of the dismayed look with which Oliver regarded his tormentors, Master Bates, who was blessed with a lively sense of the ludicrous, fell into another ectasy, more boisterous than the first. “They belong to the old gentleman,” said Oliver, wringing his hands; “to the good, kind, old gentleman who took me into his house, and had me nursed, when I was near dying of the fever.Oh, pray send them back; send him back the books and money.Keep me here all my life long; but pray, pray send them back.He’ll think I stole them; the old lady: all of them who were so kind to me: will think I stole them.Oh, do have mercy upon me, and send them back!”"
"说这些话的时候，奥利弗痛不欲生，他跪倒在犹太佬的脚下，双手合在一起，拼命地哀求。","With these words, which were uttered with all the energy of passionate grief, Oliver fell upon his knees at the Jew’s feet; and beat his hands together, in perfect desperation."
"“他是对的，”费金说着偷偷环顾一下，他那两道浓眉紧紧拧成了一个结，“你是对的，奥利弗，你说的对；他们会认为是你偷走了这些东西。哈哈！”老犹太边笑边搓着手，“就算我们精心挑选时间，也不可能这么巧啊！”","“The boy’s right,” remarked Fagin, looking covertly round, and knitting his shaggy eyebrows into a hard knot.“You’re right, Oliver, you’re right; they will think you have stolen ’em.Ha! ha!” chuckled the Jew, rubbing his hands, “it couldn’t have happened better, if we had chosen our time!”"
"“当然不可能喽，”赛克斯回答，“我一看到他从克拉肯韦尔走过来，胳膊底下夹着这些书，心里就有数了。这可真是再好不过了。他们都是菩萨心肠，只会唱赞美诗，否则的话他们也不会收留他。他们也不会对他加以询问。他们是怕还得去报案，弄不好还得把他关起来。他绝对安全。”","“Of course it couldn’t,” replied Sikes; “I know’d that, directly I see him coming through Clerkenwell, with the books under his arm. it’s all right enough.They’re soft-hearted psalm-singers, or they wouldn’t have taken him in at all; and they’ll ask no questions after him, fear they should be obliged to prosecute, and so get him lagged.He’s safe enough.”"
"他们说着这些话时，奥利弗一个一个地打量着他们，仿佛坠入云里雾里，无法理解发生的这一切。但是，当赛克斯刚说完，他便猛然跳起来，不顾一切地往门口跑去，口里还呼喊着救命，这使得这个空空的老房子顿时连屋顶都快被掀起来了。","Oliver had looked from one to the other, while these words were being spoken, as if he were bewildered, and could scarecely understand what passed; but when Bill Sikes concluded, he jumped suddenly to his feet, and tore wildly from the room: uttering shrieks for help, which made the bare old house echo to the roof."
"“比尔，把狗唤住！”南希叫喊着冲到门前，把门关上了。费金跟他的两个弟子追了出去。“把狗唤回去，它会把那个孩子撕成碎片的。”","“Keep back the dog, Bill!” cried Nancy, springing before the door, and closing it, as the Jew and his two pupils darted out in pursuit.“Keep back the dog; he’ll tear the boy to pieces.”"
"“他活该！”赛克斯叫着，努力想挣脱姑娘的手。“你给我站到一边去，否则我就把你脑袋在墙上撞个粉碎。”","“Serve him right!” cried Sikes, struggling to disengage himself from the girl’s grasp.“Stand off from me, or I’ll split your head against the wall.”"
"“我才不在乎呢，比尔，我不在乎，”南希高喊着，不顾一切地跟那个家伙争斗，“我不会让那个孩子被狗咬死的，除非你先杀了我。”","“I don’t care for that, Bill, I don’t care for that,” screamed the girl, struggling violently with the man, “the child shan’t be torn down by the dog, unless you kill me first.”"
"“就该咬死他！”赛克斯牙齿咬得咯吱咯吱响，“你要再不放手，我可真要那么做了。”","“Shan’t he!” said Sikes, setting his teeth.“I’ll soon do that, if you don’t keep off.”"
"这个强盗一把将南希甩到了房间另一头。就在这时候，犹太佬和两个弟子架着奥利弗回来了。","The housebreaker flung the girl from him to the further end of the room, just as the Jew and the two boys returned, dragging Oliver among them."
"“这儿发生什么事了！”费金一边问，一边环顾四周。","“What’s the matter here!” said Fagin, looking round."
"“我看这娘们儿疯了。”赛克斯野蛮地回答。","“The girl’s gone mad, I think,” replied Sikes, savagely."
"“没有，我没疯，”这场混战使得南希面色苍白，上气不接下气，“我才没疯呢，费金，别听他胡说。”","“No, she hasn’t,” said Nancy, pale and breathless from the scuffle; “no, she hasn’t, Fagin; don’t think it.”"
"“那就安静点吧，行吗？”犹太佬恐吓道。","“Then keep quiet, will you?” said the Jew, with a threatening look."
"“不，我偏不！”南希高声回答，“喂！你们打算怎么办？”","“No, I won’t do that, neither,” replied Nancy, speaking very loud.“Come!What do you think of that?”"
"费金对南希这类女子的做事方式和习惯了如指掌，他很清楚，现在继续跟她争论下去是极其危险的。为了岔开大家的注意力，他朝着奥利弗转过去。","Mr. Fagin was sufficiently well acquainted with the manners and customs of that particular species of humanity to which Nancy belonged, to feel tolerably certain that it would be rather unsafe to prolong any conversation with her, at present.With the view of diverting the attention of the company, he turned to Oliver."
"“这么说，你是想逃跑了，我亲爱的孩子，是不是呀？”犹太佬说着，拿起了壁炉边上放着的一把边缘参差不齐、凹凸不平的棍子，“嗯？”","“So you wanted to get away, my dear, did you?” said the Jew, taking up a jagged and knotted club which law in a corner of the fireplace; “eh?”"
"奥利弗没有吭声。但是他注视着犹太佬的一举一动，呼吸很急促。","Oliver made no reply.But he watched the Jew’s motions, and breathed quickly."
"“你想找人帮忙，想把警察招来，是不是？”费金冷笑着抓住奥利弗的胳膊，“我的小少爷，我们会治治你这毛病的。”","“Wanted to get assistance; called for the police; did you?” sneered the Jew, catching the boy by the arm.“We’ll cure you of that, my young master.”"
"费金抡起棍子，朝奥利弗的肩膀狠狠地打了一下。他正准备打第二下，南希扑了上去，从他手里夺走了木棍。她把木棍使劲扔进了火里，壁炉里一些烧得通红的煤块都溅了出来，在屋子里滚动。","The Jew inflicted a smart blow on Oliver’s shoulders with the club; and was raising it for a second, when the girl, rushing forward, wrested it from his hand.She flung it into the fire, with a force that brought some of the glowing coals whirling out into the room."
"“我不会袖手旁观的，费金，”南希喝道，“你已经捉到了这个孩子，还想怎么样啊？——放开他——放开他，不然的话我就把那个戳也给你们盖两下，提前送我上绞刑架算了。”","“I won’t stand by and see it done, Fagin,” cried the girl.“You’ve  got the boy, and what more would you have?—Let him be—let him be—or I shall put that mark on some of you, that will bring me to the gallows before my time.”"
"南希使劲跺着地板威胁道。她抿着嘴唇，双手紧握，依次打量着犹太佬和另一个强盗。由于愤怒，她的脸上没有一丝血色。","The girl stamped her foot violently on the floor as she vented this threat; and with her lips compressed, and her hands clenched, looked alternately at the Jew and the other robber: her face quite colourless from the passion of rage into which she had gradually worked herself."
"“哎哟，南希！”犹太佬跟赛克斯不知所措地互相看了对方一眼。之后，费金口气和缓地说道：“你——你可从来没像今晚这么聪明呢。哈哈！我亲爱的，你这一手真漂亮。”","“Why, Nancy!” said the Jew, in a soothing tone; after a pause, during which he and Mr. Sikes had stared at one another in a disconcerted manner; “you,—you’re more clever than ever to-night.Ha! ha! my dear, you are acting beautifully.”"
"“那又如何！”南希说道，“当心别让我演过火了。否则，费金，你可就要更倒霉了。所以我告诉你，趁早别来惹我。”","“Am I!” said the girl.“Take care I don’t overdo it.You will be the worse for it, Fagin, if I do; and so I tell you in good time to keep clear of me.”"
"当女人发起火来，特别是她又在所有其他的强烈感情之中加上不计后果的冲动和绝望后，身上确实能产生某种东西。这种东西是男人很少愿意招惹的。犹太佬发现，如果假装误解南希小姐发怒这一事实，事情会变得无可挽回。他不由自主地退后了几步，恳求且怯懦地看了赛克斯一眼，似乎想暗示他才是继续这场谈判的不二人选。","There is something about a roused woman: especially if she add to all her other strong passions, the fierce impulses of recklessness and despair; which few men like to provoke.The Jew saw that it would be hopeless to affect any further mistake regarding the reality of Miss Nancy’s rage; and, shrinking involuntarily back a few paces, cast a glance, half imploring and half cowardly, at Sikes: as if to hint that he was the fittest person to pursue the dialogue."
"面对这一无声的求救，或许是因为赛克斯感觉到是否能够迅速让南希小姐恢复理性，关系到他本人的荣誉和影响，他发出了无数的诅咒和威胁。这些东西来得如此之快，使人不得不相信他很有发明创造方面的才能。但是，这些并没有在攻击目标身上产生立竿见影的效果，他只能依靠更加确凿有力的理论了。","Mr. Sikes, thus mutely appealed to; and possibly feeling his personal pride and influence interested in the immediate reduction of Miss Nancy to reason; gave utterance to about a couple of score of curses and threats, the rapid production of which reflected great credit on the fertility of his invention.As they produced no visible effect on the object against whom they were discharged, however, he resorted to more tangible arguments."
"“你这是什么意思？”赛克斯问这句话的时候，使用了一句极为常用的诅咒，其中涉及了人类面貌特征中最美妙的一处。每五万次该诅咒中只要有一次被上帝听到，人类双目失明便会变得像麻疹一样常见。“你这是什么意思？活见鬼了！你还知道你自己是谁吗！还知道自己是个什么东西吗？”","“What do you mean by this?” said Sikes; backing the inquiry with a very common imprecation concerning the most beautiful of human features: which, if it were heard above, only once out of every fifty thousand times that it is uttered below, would render blindness as common a disorder as measles: “what do you mean by it?Burn my body!Do you know who you are, and what you are?”"
"“啊呀，当然知道，我全知道。”姑娘歇斯底里地大笑起来，脑袋晃来晃去，那副冷漠的姿态装得很勉强。","“Oh, yes, I know all about it,” replied the girl, laughing hysterically; and shaking her head from side to side, with a poor assumption of indifference."
"“既然知道，那你就安静点儿吧，”赛克斯用平常唤狗的腔调大叫，“否则我会让你好好安静会儿的。”","“Well, then, keep quiet,” rejoined Sikes, with a growl like that he was accustomed to use when addressing his dog, “or I’ll quiet you for a good long time to come.”"
"姑娘又大笑起来，甚至比之前更加不冷静了。她迅速扫了赛克斯一眼，又把头转向了一边，紧咬的嘴唇都流血了。","The girl laughed again: even less composedly than before; and, darting a hasty look at Sikes, turned her face aside, and bit her lip till the blood came."
"“你是好样的，”赛克斯轻蔑地审视着她，补充说道，“你也想学人家菩萨心肠了！你管他叫小孩了。这小孩还真是个漂亮的人，我看你就跟他交个朋友吧。”","“You’re a nice one,” added Sikes, as he surveyed her with a contemptuous air, “to take up the humane and gen-teel side!A pretty subject for the child, as you call him, to make a friend of!”"
"“万能的上帝，保佑我吧，我会的！”姑娘激动地喊道，“早知道我出手把他弄到这儿会发生这种事，我情愿在街上给人打死或者跟咱们路过的那地方的人们换换位置。从今晚起，他就是一个贼，一个骗子，一个恶魔，就会变得那么坏了。那个老混蛋，这还不够吗？非得打他一顿才满足吗？”","“Dod Almighty help me, I am!” cried the girl passionately; “and I wish I had been struck dead in the street, or had changed places with them we passed so near to-night, before I had lent a hand in bringing him here.He’s a thief, a liar, a devil, all that’s bad, from this night forth.Isn’t that enough for the old wretch, without blows?”"
"“嗨，嗨，赛克斯，”费金向站在一旁的几个少年打手势。他们正睁大双眼注视着这儿发生的一切。然后他用规劝的语气说道：“大伙儿说话都客气点儿，客气点儿，比尔。”","“Come, come, Sikes,” said the Jew appealing to him in a remonstratory tone, and motioning towards the boys, who were eagerly attentive to all that passed; “we must have civil words; civil words, Bill.”"
"“客气点儿！”南希高声喊道。她满脸怒气，让人害怕。“客气点儿，你这个恶棍！不错，你话该我对你说这些话。我小时候，年纪还没他一半大的时候，就替你偷东西了。”她指了指奥利弗，“我在这个行当干这买卖已经十二年了。你不知道吗？说话啊！你不知道吗？”","“Civil words!” cried the girl, whose passion was frightful to see.“Civil words, you villain!Yes, you deserve ’em from me.I thieved for you when I was a child not half as old as this!” pointing to Oliver.“I have been in the same trade, and in the same service, for twelve years since.Don’t you know it?Speak out!Don’t you know it?”"
"“得了，得了，”费金一心要息事宁人，“就算是那样，也是为了你能混口饭吃！”","“Well, well,” replied the Jew, with an attempt at pacification; “and, if you have, it’s your living!”"
"“哼，混口饭吃！”姑娘反驳道，她不是在说话，而是用一连串叫喊声把这些词语倾泻出来，“我混口饭吃，那些又冷又脏又潮湿的街道成了我的家。很久之前，就是你这个卑鄙的家伙把我赶到街道上的，让我呆在那儿，无论白天夜晚，夜晚白天，得呆在那儿，直到我死。”","“Aye, it is!” returned the girl; not speaking, but pouring out the words in one continuous and vehement scream.“It is my living; and the cold, wet, dirty streets are my home; and you’re the wretch that drove me to them long ago, and that’s ll keep me there, day and night, day and night, till I die!”"
"“我可要跟你翻脸了！”犹太佬被这些指责激怒了，插嘴道，“你要是再多嘴的话，我会做得比当年更狠的。”","“I shall do you a mischief!” interposed the Jew, goaded by these reproaches; “a mischief worse than that, if you say much more!”"
"南希没有再说话，但是她发狂一般地撕扯着自己的头发和衣裳，冲着犹太佬撞过去。要不是赛克斯及时抓住了她的手腕，她可能已经在犹太佬身上留下了报复的痕迹。她无力地挣扎了几下，便昏了过去。","The girl said nothing more; but, tearing her hair and dress in a transport of passion, made such a rush at the Jew as would probably have left signal marks of her revenge upon him, had not her wrists been seized by Sikes at the right moment; upon which, she made a few ineffectual struggles, and fainted."
"“她目前没事了，”赛克斯说着把她放倒在一个角落里，“她这么发起飙来，胳膊力气大着呢。”","“She’s all right now,” said Sikes, laying her down in a corner.“She’s uncommon strong in the arms, when she’s up in this way.”"
"费金抹了抹额头，微微一笑，彷佛是对这一风波的结束表示欣慰。不过无论是他、赛克斯、那几个孩子，还是那条狗，似乎都认为这只是一桩司空见惯的小事而已。","The Jew wiped his forehead: and smiled, as if it were a relief to have the disturbance over; but neither he, nor Sikes, nor the dog, nor the boys, seemed to consider it in any other light than a common occurance incidental to business."
"“跟娘们儿打交道最麻烦了，”费金说着把棍子放回原处，“可是她们又很聪明，干我们这行还真离不了她们。查利，带着奥利弗睡觉去吧。”","“It’s the worst of having to do with women,” said the Jew, replacing his club; “but they’re clever, and we can’t get on, in our line, without ’em.Charley, show Oliver to bed.”"
"“费金，我看他明天还是不要穿这一身漂亮衣服了，是吧？”查利·贝茨问道。","“I suppose he’d better not wear his best clothes tomorrow, Fagin, had he?” inquired Charley Bates."
"“当然不能穿了。”犹太佬说着，露出了与查利提问时相同的嘴脸。","“Certainly not,” replied the Jew, reciprocating the grin with which Charley put the question."
"贝茨少爷显然很乐意接受这一任务。他拿起那个有裂缝的棍子，领着奥利弗来到隔壁厨房。里面放着两三个铺位，以前奥利弗就是睡在这儿的。查利不由自主地笑了两声，拿出了奥利弗在布朗洛先生家里开心地换下来的那套旧衣服。买走这套衣服的那个犹太人碰巧拿给费金看过，这才使得费金获得了关于奥利弗行踪的第一条线索。","Master Bates, apparently much delighted with his commission, took the cleft stick: and led Oliver into an adjacent kitchen, where there were two or three of the beds on which he had slept before;and here, with many uncontrollable bursts of laughter, he produced the identical old suit of clothes which Oliver had so much congratulated himself upon leaving off at Mr. Brownlow’s; and the accidental display of which, to Fagin, by the Jew who purchased them, had been the very first clue received, of his whereabout."
"“把那套漂亮的衣服脱下来吧，”查利说道，“我把它交给费金保管。这事真有趣！”","“Put off the smart ones,” said Charley, “and I’ll give ‘em to Fagin to take care of.What fun it is!”"
"可怜的奥利弗极不情愿地照办了。贝茨少爷把新衣裳卷起来夹在胳膊底下，随手锁门离去了，把奥利弗一个人留在了黑暗之中。","Poor Oliver unwillingly complied.Master Bates rolling up the new clothes under his arm, departed from the room, leaving Oliver in the dark, and locking the door behind him."
"隔壁传来了查利的笑声以及贝齐小姐的声音。她来得正是时候，可以给她的好朋友南希浇点冷水或者做点其他别的事情，促使她苏醒过来，这些事情男士可不方便做。即使是在一个比奥利弗所处的地方更加舒适的环境里，查利的笑声和贝齐的说话声，也会使很多人睡不着觉。但是奥利弗实在是很不舒服，而且相当疲惫，所以没多久，就呼呼地睡去了。","The noise of Charley’s laughter, and the voice of Miss Betsy, who opportunely arrived to throw water over her friend, and perform other feminine offices for the promotion of her recovery, might have kept many people awake under more happy circumstances than those in which Oliver was placed.But he was sick and weary; and he soon fell sound asleep."
"第十七章 奥利弗接连不断的厄运，以及一位前来伦敦的重要人物对奥利弗名声的伤害","CHAPTER XVII Oliver’s destiny continuing unpropitious, brings a great man to london to injure his reputation. "
"在一场好看的谋杀剧中，悲惨的场面和滑稽的场面总是交替出现，就像一块块肥瘦相间的熏肉一样，这已经是舞台上的惯例了。男主人公先是被束缚和厄运所累，倒在草褥上。在接下来的一场中，他那忠诚却木讷的仆人用幽默的小调逗得观众乐不可支。女主人公落入傲慢无情的男爵的魔掌，贞洁和生命都受到威胁。她拔出匕首，冒生命危险保全贞操。看到这儿，我们的心怦怦直跳。当我们的期待被提升到最高限度，只听一声口哨，我们的注意力立马又被吸引到城堡大厅里。在那里，一位白发苍苍的老管家正在领唱一首有趣的歌曲。伴唱的是一群更加有趣的仆人们，他们从各种地方跑出来，从教堂地下室到宫殿大厅，正结伴四处漫游，一直不停地唱着。","It is the custom on the stage, in all good murderous melodramas, to present the tragic and the comic scenes, in as regular alternation, as the layers of red and white in a side of streaky bacon.The hero sinks upon his straw bed, weighed down by fetters and misfortunes; in the next scene, his faithful but unconscious squire regales the audience with a comic song.We behold, with throbbing bosoms, the heroine in the grasp of a proud and ruthless baron: her virtue and her life alike in danger, drawing forth her dagger to preserve the one at the cost of the other;and just as our expectations are wrought up to the highest pitch, a whistle is heard, and we are straightway transported to the great hall of the castle; where a grey-headed seneschal sings a funny chorus with a funnier body of vassals, who are free of all sorts of places, from church vaults to palaces, and roam about in company, carolling perpetually."
"这样的变化看起来很荒唐，但是它们并非第一眼看上去那么不合常理。在现实生活中，从摆着美味佳肴的餐桌到临终前的灵床，从吊丧孝服到节日盛装，这些变迁都同样惊人。只是，我们都是匆忙的演员，而非被动的看客罢了，这一点还是很不同的。在剧院里演戏的演员，对剧烈的变迁或是强烈的感情爆发已经麻木。但是对于观众来说，这些马上便会被判定为是荒谬可笑的。","Such changes appear absurd; but they are not so unnatural as they would seem at first sight.The transitions in real life from well-spread boards to death-beds, and from mourning-weeds to holiday garments, are not a whit less startling; only, there, we are busy actors, instead of passive lookers-on, which makes a vast difference.The actors in the mimic life of the theatre, are blind to violent transitions and abrupt impulses of passion or feeling, which, presented before the eyes of mere spectators, are at once condemned as outrageous and preposterous."
"鉴于场景突然改变和时空迅速变化不仅在书本中被长期使用，而且还被视为作者的重要写作技巧——一些评论家认为，作家的这一写作技巧主要与每章结束时把人物置于怎样的窘境中有关——读者或许会认为之前这段简短的介绍是不必要的。如果是这样的话，就把这段话当成本书作者的一个巧妙暗示吧。他马上要回到奥利弗·特威斯特出生的那座小城市去了。读者们理所当然地会认为，这趟远行一定有其充分而有力的理由，否则他是不会被邀请进行这一番远行的。","As sudden shiftings of the scene, and rapid changes of time and place, are not only sanctioned in books by long usage, but are by many considered as the great art of authorship: an author’s skill in his craft being, by such critics, chiefly estimated with relation to the dilemmas in which he leaves his characters at the end of every chapter: this brief introduction to the present one may perhaps be deemed unnecessary.If so, let it be considered a delicate intimation on the part of the historian that he is going back to the town in which Oliver Twist was born; the reader taking it for granted that there are good and substantial reasons for making the journey, or he would not be invited to proceed upon such an expedition."
"这一天，邦布尔先生一大早就走出济贫院大门，迈着方步威风凛凛地走上大街。他神采飞扬，对在教区做事充满了自豪感。他的三角帽和蓝色制服在朝阳底下熠熠生辉。他紧紧握着手杖，精力旺盛，体格健壮。邦布尔先生总是喜欢仰着头，这天早上他的头仰得比平时都高。他双目出神，神态庄严。这副神气或许已经向观察力敏锐的陌生人发出了警告，这位教区执事心中闪现的念头太过伟大，是无法描述的。","Mr. Bumble emerged at early morning from the workhouse-gate, and walked with portly carriage and commanding steps, up the High Street.He was in the full bloom and pride of beadlehood; his cocked hat and coat were dazzling in the morning sun; he clutched his cane with the vigorous tenacity of health and power.Mr. Bumble always carried his head high; but this morning it was higher than usual.There was an abstraction in his eye, an elevation in his air, which might have warned an observant stranger that thoughts were passing in the beadle’s mind, too great for utterance."
"他经过时，几位小店掌柜之流的人毕恭毕敬地跟他搭话，他没有停下来搭理他们。他只是扬扬手向他们回礼。他自始至终保持着威严的步伐，直到他走进曼太太的寄养所。在那里，曼太太带着教区特有的爱心，照顾那些贫困孩子。","Mr. Bumble stopped not to converse with the small shopkeepers and others who spoke to him, deferentially, as he passed along.He merely returned their salutations with a wave of his hand, and relaxed not in his dignified pace, until he reached the farm where Mrs. Mann tended the infant paupers with parochial care."
"“该死的执事！”曼太太一听那敲花园门的熟悉的声音，就说道，“这么一大早，不是他才怪呢！啊，邦布尔先生，我就知道是你！哦，天哪，这可真是太让人高兴了！快请到客厅来，先生。”","“Drat that beadle!” said Mrs. Mann, hearing the well-known shaking at the garden-gate.“If it isn’t him at this time in the morning!Lauk, Mr. Bumble, only think of its being you!Well, dear me, it is a pleasure, this is!Come into the parlour, sir, please.”"
"开头那句是对苏珊说的，后面那一番愉悦的寒暄是说给邦布尔先生听的。那位贤惠的太太打开花园的大门，小心且礼貌地领着他来到屋子里。","The first sentence was addressed to Susan; and the exclamations of delight were uttered to Mr. Bumble: as the good lady unlocked the garden-gate: and showed him, with great attention and respect, into the house."
"“曼太太，”邦布尔先生不像通常那些不讲礼貌的家伙一样，一屁股坐下来，或者一下子把自己抛到座位里，而是渐渐地、缓缓地坐下，坐到一把椅子上，“曼太太，夫人，早上好。”","“Mrs. Mann,” said Mr. Bumble; not sitting upon, or dropping himself into a seat, as any common jackanapes would: but letting himself gradually and slowly down into a chair; “Mrs. Mann, ma’am, good morning.”"
"“噢，早上好，先生。”曼太太脸上堆满笑意，回答道，“你这一阵子身体不错吧，先生。”","“Well, and good morning to you, sir,” replied Mrs. Mann, with many smiles; “and hoping you find yourself well, sir!”"
"“马马虎虎吧，曼太太。”教区执事回答，“教区的生活可不总是称心如意啊，曼太太。”","“So-so, Mrs. Mann,” replied the beadle.“A porochial life is not a bed of roses, Mrs. Mann.”"
"“嗯，确实不是，先生。”曼太太答道。要是让寄养所的孩子们听到这句话，他们一定也会彬彬有礼地齐声回答。","“Ah, that it isn’t indeed, Mr. Bumble,” rejoined the lady.And all the infant paupers might have chorussed the rejoinder with great propriety, if they had heard it."
"“夫人，教区的生活，”邦布尔先生用手杖敲着桌子，继续说道，“就得操心，充满了烦恼，还得要勇敢。我敢说，所有的公众人物都躲不开被投诉。”","“A porochial life, ma’am,” continued Mr. Bumble, striking the table with his cane, “is a life of worrit, and vexation, and hardihood; but all public characters, as I may say, must suffer prosecution.”"
"曼太太并没有完全明白他的意思，但还是略带同情地抬了抬手，叹了口气。","Mrs. Mann, not very well knowing what the beadle meant, raised her hands with a look of sympathy, and sighed."
"“哎！曼太太，确实可叹啊！”教区执事说道。","“Ah!You may well sigh, Mrs. Mann!” said the beadle."
"看到自己做对了，曼太太便再次叹了口气，显然是在存心讨好这位公众人物。而此时，邦布尔先生正严肃地注视着自己的三角帽，努力不流露出得意的笑容，他说道：“曼太太，我要去一趟伦敦。”","Finding she had done right, Mrs. Mann sighed again: evidently to the satisfaction of the public character: who, repressing a complacent smile by looking sternly at his cocked hat, said, “Mrs. Mann, I am going to London.”"
"“哦，邦布尔先生！”曼太太惊叫一声，后退几步。","“Lauk, Mr. Bumble!” cried Mrs. Mann, starting back."
"“去伦敦，太太。”顽固的教区执事继续说道，“坐马车去。我，还有两个穷人一起去，曼太太！有一桩关于居住权的案子就要开庭了。理事会指定我——我，曼太太——去克拉肯韦尔季审法庭证明这件事。","“To London, ma’am,” resumed the inflexible beadle, “by coach.I and two paupers, Mrs. Mann!A legal action is a coming on, about a settlement; and the board has appointed me—me, Mrs. Mann—to dispose to the matter before the quarter-sessions at Clerkinwell."
"我真怀疑，”邦布尔先生坐直了，补充说，“在跟我说清楚之前，克拉肯韦尔法庭能否看出他们自己搞错了。”","And I very much question,” added Mr. Bumble, drawing himself up, “whether the Clerkinwell Sessions will not find themselves in the wrong box before they have done with me.”"
"“噢！你可不能对他们太苛刻，先生。”曼太太巧言劝道。","“Oh! you mustn’t be too hard upon them, sir,” said Mrs. Mann, coaxingly."
"“这是克拉肯韦尔季审法庭自找的，太太。”邦布尔先生回答，“要是他们发现结果比他们料想的差得多，那也只能怪他们自己了。”","“The Clerkinwell Sessions have brought it upon themselves, ma’am,” replied Mr. Bumble; “and if the Clerkinwell Sessions find that they come off rather worse than they expected, the Clerkinwell Sessions have only themselves to thank.”"
"邦布尔先生说这些话的时候，是一副威胁的架势，表现出他心意已定，不达目的誓不罢休的决心。曼太太对他的话感到敬畏。最后她说：“你们是坐马车去吧，先生？我还以为向来是用大车送那帮穷鬼呢。”","There was so much determination and depth of purpose about the menacing manner in which Mr. Bumble delivered himself of these words, that Mrs. Mann appeared quite awed by them.At length she said, “You’re going by coach, sir?I thought it was always usual to send them paupers in carts.”"
"“曼太太，那是在他们生病的时候。”教区执事说道，“在多雨季节，我们把有病的穷小子们安顿在敞开的大货车里，防止他们着凉。”","“That’s when they’re ill, Mrs. Mann,” said the beadle.“We put the sick paupers into open carts in the rainy weather, to prevent their taking cold.”"
"“噢！”曼太太说。","“Oh!” said Mrs. Mann."
"“回伦敦的班车答应捎上他们两个，收费也不贵。”邦布尔先生说，“他们两个都快完了。我们发现让他们挪个地方比埋了他们还便宜两英镑呢——也就是说，要是我能把他们扔到另一个教区，这点我相信应该能够办到，只要他们别死在路上给我们带来麻烦就行。哈哈哈！”","“The opposition coach contracts for these two; and takes them cheap,” said Mr. Bumble.“They are both in a very low state, and we find it would come two pound cheaper to move ’em than to bury ’em—that is, if we can throw ‘em upon another parish, which I think we shall be able to do, if they don’t die upon the road to spite us.Ha! ha! ha!”"
"邦布尔先生刚笑了一会儿，他的目光再次碰到三角帽，于是他又变得严肃庄重起来。","When Mr. Bumble had laughed a little while, his eyes again encountered the cocked hat; and he became grave."
"“我们把正事给忘记了，夫人。”教区执事说道，“这是本月教区付您的薪水。”","“We are forgetting business, ma’am,” said the beadle; “here is your porochial stipend for the month.”"
"邦布尔先生从钱袋里掏出用纸卷着的一些银币，要曼太太写张收据。","Mr. Bumble produced some silver money rolled up in paper, from his pocket-book; and requested a receipt: which Mrs. Mann wrote."
"“这上边有些污迹，先生。”寄养所的所长说道，“不过，我敢说，写得还算正规。邦布尔先生，谢谢你了。我真不知道怎么感谢你才好，真的。”","“It’s s very much blotted, sir,” said the farmer of infants; “but it’s formal enough, I dare say.Thank you, Mr. Bumble, sir, I am very much obliged to you, I’m sure.”"
"邦布尔先生和气地点点头，答谢曼太太的屈膝礼，接着便问起了孩子们的情况。","Mr. Bumble nodded, blandly, in acknowledgment of Mrs. Mann’s curtsey; and inquired how the children were."
"“老天保佑那些可爱的小心肝！”曼太太深情地说，“这些宝贝儿，他们好得不能再好了！当然，除了上周死去的那两个。小迪克也不是很好。”","“Bless their dear little hearts!” said Mrs. Mann with emotion, “they’re as well as can be, the dears!Of course, except the two that died last week.And little Dick.”"
"“那个孩子一点也没好转吗？”邦布尔先生询问道。","“Isn’t that boy no better?” inquired Mr. Bumble."
"曼太太摇摇头。","Mrs. Mann shook her head."
"“那可真是个心术不正、品行败坏的坏小子。”邦布尔先生生气地说道，“他在哪里呢？”","“He’s a ill-conditioned, wicious, bad-disposed porochial child that,” said Mr. Bumble angrily.“Where is he?”"
"“先生，我这就叫他来见你。”曼太太回答，“迪克，过来！”","“I’ll bring him to you in one minute, sir,” replied Mrs. Mann.“Here, you Dick!”"
"唤了好久，才找到迪克。曼太太给他在唧筒底下洗了把脸，用自己的长袍给他把脸擦干，才领着他来拜见教区执事邦布尔先生。","After some calling, Dick was discovered.Having had his face put under the pump, and dried upon Mrs. Mann’s gown, he was led into the awful presence of Mr. Bumble, the beadle."
"这个孩子面色苍白，瘦骨嶙峋。他的脸颊深陷，眼睛大而明亮。他身穿教区贫儿制服，有些衣不遮体，可能是因为教区布料不足吧。尽管这样，这身制服在他虚弱无力的身上依旧显得十分宽松。他瘦小的肢体已经像老人的肢体一样萎缩了。","The child was pale and thin; his cheeks were sunken; and his eyes large and bright.The scanty parish dress, the livery of his misery, hung loosely on his feeble body; and his young limbs had wasted away, like those of an old man."
"这个小东西站在邦布尔先生面前，被邦布尔先生盯着，不停地发抖着。他不敢把目光从地板上抬起来，甚至一听到执事的声音就已经怕得要死了。","Such was the little being who stood trembling beneath Mr. Bumble’s glance; not daring to lift his eyes from the floor; and dreading even to hear the beadle’s voice."
"“你就不能抬头看看这位绅士吗？你这个顽固的孩子。”曼太太说道。","“Can’t you look at the gentleman, you obstinate boy?” said Mrs. Mann."
"这个孩子温顺地抬起头，目光与邦布尔先生相遇了。","The child meekly raised his eyes, and encountered those of Mr. Bumble."
"“你这是怎么了，被教区收养的小迪克？”邦布尔先生适时地开着玩笑，问道。","“What’s the matter with you, porochial Dick?” inquired Mr. Bumble, with well-timed jocularity."
"“没什么，先生。”孩子有气无力地回答。","“Nothing, sir,” replied the child faintly."
"“我想也没什么。”曼太太当然得对邦布尔先生的幽默大笑一阵。","“I should think not,” said Mrs. Mann, who had of course laughed very much at Mr. Bumble’s humour."
"“我确定，你什么也不想要。”","“You want for nothing, I’m sure.”"
"“我想——”孩子结巴地说道。","“I should like—” faltered the child."
"“哎哟！”曼太太打断了他的话，“我看你现在一定要说你确实需要某样东西了吧？哼，你这个小坏蛋——”“等等，曼太太，等等！”教区执事如同权威人士一般，扬起一只手说道。“小兄弟，想要什么，嗯？”","“Hey—day!” interposed Mr. Mann, “I suppose you’re going to say that you do want for something, now?Why, you little wretch—” “Stop, Mrs. Mann, stop!” said the beadle, raising his hand with a show of authority.“Like what, sir, eh?”"
"“我想，”孩子结结巴巴地说，“要是有人会写字的话，帮我在一张纸上写几句话吧，再把它折好，密封起来，等我死后替我保存着。”","“I should like,” faltered the child, “if somebody that can write, would put a few words down for me on a piece of paper, and fold it up and seal it, and keep it for me, after I am laid in the ground.”"
"“咳，这孩子是什么意思？”邦布尔先生大声说道。迪克那认真的神情和苍白的脸色给他留下了某种印象，尽管他对这样的事情早已经司空见惯。“小兄弟，你是什么意思呢？”","“Why, what does the boy mean?” exclaimed Mr. Bumble, on whom the earnest manner and wan aspect of the child had made some impression: accustomed as he was to such things.“What do you mean, sir?”"
"“我想，”孩子说道，“我想把我真挚的爱留给可怜的奥利弗·特威斯特，让他知道，一想到他在漆黑的夜里到处流浪，也没人帮助他，我经常就会一个人坐下来，哭个不停。我想要告诉他，”孩子将两只小手合在一起，饱含深情地说道，“我很高兴，在我还没长大的时候，我就会死去。要是我长成大人，变老了，我那在天堂的小妹妹说不定就会把我忘记了，或者一点也不像我了。要是我们两个都是孩子，呆在天堂里会多么快活！”","“I should like,” said the child, “to leave my dear love to poor Oliver Twist; and to let him know how often I have sat by myself and cried to think of his wandering about in the dark nights with nobody to help him.And I should like to tell him,” said the child pressing his small hands together, and speaking with great fervour,“that I was glad to die when I was very young; for, perhaps, if I had lived to be a man, and had grown old, my little sister who is in Heaven, might forget me, or be unlike me; and it would be so much happier if we were both children there together.”"
"邦布尔先生从头到脚打量着说话的孩子，相当吃惊。然后他转身对他的朋友说道：“这帮小鬼都一样，曼太太。那个无法无天的奥利弗，把他们全都教坏了！”","Mr. Bumble surveyed the little speaker, from head to foot, with indescribable astonishment; and, turning to his companion, said, “They’re all in one story, Mrs. Mann.That out-dacious Oliver had demoralized them all!”"
"“我才不信他的那些鬼话呢，先生。”曼太太说着，抬起双手，恶狠狠地盯着迪克，“我从来没见过这么可恶的小恶棍！”","“I couldn’t have believed it, sir!” said Mrs Mann, holding up her hands, and looking malignantly at Dick.“I never see such a hardened little wretch!”"
"“夫人，把他带走吧！” 邦布尔先生傲慢地说道，“这件事情必须得向理事会汇报，曼太太。”","“Take him away, ma’am!” said Mr. Bumble imperiously.“This must be stated to the board, Mrs. Mann.”"
"“我希望那些先生们能够理解，这不是我的错。你说呢，先生？”曼太太抽泣着低语道。","“I hope the gentleman will understand that it isn’t my fault, sir?” said Mrs. Mann, whimpering pathetically."
"“他们会谅解的，太太。他们会把事情搞清楚的。”邦布尔先生说，“得啦。把他带走吧，我可不想再看见他了。”","“They shall understand that, ma’am; they shall be acquainted with the true state of the case,” said Mr. Bumble.“There; take him away, I can’t bear the sight on him.”"
"迪克立马被带走锁进煤窖里了。随后，邦布尔先生起身告辞，去打点他的行装了。","Dick was immediately taken away, and locked up in the coal-cellar.Mr. Bumble shortly afterwards took himself off, to prepare for his journey."
"第二天早上六点，邦布尔先生坐上了公共马车的顶座。他把三角帽换成了一顶圆礼帽，身上穿着一件带披肩的蓝色大衣。那两个居住权尚有争议的犯人跟着他。后来他们便准时到达伦敦了。","At six o’clock next morning, Mr. Bumble: having exchanged his cocked hat for a round one, and encased his person in a blue great-coat with a cape to it: took his place on the outside of the coach, accompanied by the criminals whose settlement was disputed; with whom, in due course of time, he arrived in London."
"一路上别的倒是没有什么，只是那两个臭小子的臭毛病有些复发。他们两个不停地打战，抱怨天气寒冷。用邦布尔先生的话说，他们俩弄得他牙齿咔哒咔哒直打架，浑身都不舒服，尽管他还穿着一件大衣。","He experienced no other crosses on the way, than those which originated in the perverse behaviour of the two paupers, who persisted in shivering, and complaining of the cold, in a manner which, Mr. Bumble declared, caused his teeth to chatter in his head, and made him feel quite uncomfortable; although he had a great-coat on."
"安排好那两个臭小子的住处，邦布尔先生一个人来到停公共马车的那所房子，吃了一顿简餐，也就是蚝油牛排和黑啤酒。他将一杯兑了水的热杜松子酒放在壁炉架上，把椅子拉到炉子边坐了下来。目前各种不满和抱怨泛滥成灾，在他看来是一种罪行，他对此从道德方面进行了种种反思，随后平静了下来，开始读报纸。","Having disposed of these evil-minded persons for the night, Mr. Bumble sat himself down in the house at which the coach stopped; and took a temperate dinner of steaks, oyster sauce, and porter.Putting a glass of hot gin-and-water on the chimney-piece, he drew his chair to the fire; and, with sundry moral reflections on the too prevalent sin of discontent and complaining, composed himself to read the paper."
"邦布尔先生的目光首先停留在一则启事上。","The very first paragraph upon which Mr. Bumble’s eye rested, was the following advertisement."
"“悬赏五几尼寻一男童，名为奥利弗·特威斯特。上礼拜四黄昏时分从位于本顿维尔的家中失踪，或许是离家出走，或许是被人诱拐，迄今杳无音讯。凡能告知其下落以寻回奥利弗·特威斯特者，即可获得酬金五几尼。启者对其昔日经历亦颇为关注，凡能透露其昔日经历者，亦可获此酬金。”","“FIVE GUINEAS REWARD “Whereas a young boy, named Oliver Twist, absconded, or was enticed, on Thursday evening last, from his home, at Pentonville; and has not since been heard of.The above reward will be paid to any person who will give such information as will lead to the discovery of the said Oliver Twist, or tend to throw any light upon his previous history, in which the advertiser is, for many reasons, warmly interested.”"
"接下来便是对奥利弗穿着、身材、外貌以及失踪情况的描述，最后是布朗洛先生的姓名和地址。","And then followed a full description of Oliver’s dress, person, appearance, and disappearance: with the name and address of Mr. Brownlow at full length."
"邦布尔先生睁大了双眼，一字一句认认真真地把这则启事读了几遍。过了大约五分多钟，他已经走在去本顿维尔的路上了。由于兴奋，他连那杯热腾腾的兑水杜松子酒都没尝上一口。","Mr. Bumble opened his eyes; read the advertisement, slowly and carefully, three several times; and in something more than five minutes was on his way to Pentonville: having actually, in his excitement, left the glass of hot gin-and-water, untasted."
"“布朗洛先生在家吗？”邦布尔先生向开门的女仆询问道。","“Is Mr. Brownlow at home?” inquired Mr. Bumble of the girl who opened the door."
"对于这番询问，女仆的回答并非罕见，而是有些回避问题：“我不知道。你从哪里来？”","To this inquiry the girl returned the not uncommon, but rather evasive reply of “I don’t know; where do you come from?”"
"邦布尔先生刚说出奥利弗的名字，解释自己的来意，一直在客厅门口侧耳聆听的贝德温太太立马气喘吁吁地快步来到走廊里。","Mr. Bumble no sooner uttered Oliver’s name, in explanation of his errand, than Mrs. Bedwin, who had been listening at the parlour door, hastened into the passage in a breathless state."
"“快进来，快进来。”老太太说道，“我就知道会打听到的。苦命的孩子！我就知道会打听到的！我非常确定。愿主保佑他！我一直都这么说。”","“Come in, come in,” said the old lady: “I knew we should hear of him.Poor dear!I knew we should!I was certain of it.Bless his heart!I said so all along.”"
"说完，这位可敬的老太太又匆忙回到客厅，坐到沙发上，哭了起来。女仆的感情没有这么脆弱，她早已经跑到楼上。不一会儿她下来了，传话说，请邦布尔先生随她上楼；邦布尔先生照做了。","Having said this, the worthy old lady hurried back into the parlour again; and seating herself on a sofa, burst into tears.The girl, who was not quite so susceptible, had run upstairs meanwhile; and now returned with a request that Mr. Bumble would follow her immediately: which he did."
"他被带进一间小书房里，里面坐着布朗洛先生和他的朋友格林维格先生。两人面前摆着几只细颈饮料瓶和玻璃杯。一见到邦布尔先生，格林维格先生立刻开始哇哇大叫起来：“一个执事。准是在教区当差的执事，我要是说错了就把脑袋吃下去。”","He was shown into the little back study, where sat Mr. Brownlow and his friend Mr. Grimwig, with decanters and glasses before them.The latter gentleman at once burst into the exclamation: “A beadle.A parish beadle, or I’ll eat my head.”"
"“求你现在就别打岔了。”布朗洛先生说道，“您请坐吧。”","“Pray don’t interrupt just now,” said Mr. Brownlow.“Take a seat, will you?”"
"邦布尔先生坐了下来，对格林维格先生怪异的举动感到很困惑。布朗洛先生把灯挪了一下位置，好让自己可以不受干扰地看清楚这位教区执事的相貌。他有些焦急地说道：“这个，先生，你是看到那张启事才来的吧？”","Mr. Bumble sat himself down; quite confounded by the oddity of Mr. Grimwig’s manner.Mr. Brownlow moved the lamp, so as to obtain an uninterrupted view of the beadle’s countenance; and said, with a little impatience, “Now, sir, you come in consequence of having seen the advertisement?”"
"“是的，先生。”邦布尔先生说。","“Yes, sir.” said Mr. Bumble."
"“你是一位教区执事，对吗？”格林维格先生问道。","“And you are a beadle, are you not?” inquired Mr. Grimwig."
"“我是一个教区执事，两位先生。”邦布尔先生自豪地说道。","“I am a porochial beadle, gentlemen,” rejoined Mr. Bumble proudly."
"“显而易见的。”格林维格先生冲着自己的朋友说道，“我早就知道。一个十足的教区执事！”","“Of course,” observed Mr. Grimwig aside to his friend, “I knew he was.A beadle all over!”"
"布朗洛先生轻轻摇摇头，示意朋友安静下来，又问道：“你知道那个可怜的孩子现在在哪里吗？”","Mr. Brownlow gently shook his head to impose silence on his friend, and resumed: “Do you know where this poor boy is now?”"
"“一点也不比别人知道的多。”邦布尔先生回答。","“No more than nobody,” replied Mr. Bumble."
"“哦，那你知道他的什么情况呢？”老绅士询问道。“如果你有什么事情要说，请直说，我的朋友。你知道关于他的什么呢？”","“Well, what do you know of him?” inquired the old gentlemen.“Speak out, my friend, if you have anything to say.What do you know of him?”"
"“该不会你知道的碰巧都是些什么好事吧？”格林维格先生讽刺道，他早已经对邦布尔先生的长相做了认真的研究。","“You don’t happen to know any good of him, do you?” said Mr. Grimwig, caustically; after an attentive perusal of Mr. Bumble’s features."
"邦布尔立刻明白了这话的意思，异常严肃地摇了摇头。","Mr. Bumble, catching at the inquiry very quickly, shook his head with portentous solemnity."
"“看见了吧？”格林维格先生得意洋洋地看着布朗洛先生，说道。","“You see?” said Mr. Grimwig, looking triumphantly at Mr. Brownlow."
"布朗洛先生紧张地看着邦布尔先生那张皱巴巴的脸，请他尽可能简要地把他知道的关于奥利弗的事情都说出来。","Mr. Brownlow looked apprehensively at Mr. Bumble’s pursed-up countenance; and requested him to communicate what he knew regarding Oliver, in as few words as possible."
"邦布尔先生摘下帽子，解开大衣，将两个胳膊交叉在一起，低下头，一副正在回顾往事的样子。他沉思了片刻，开始讲述他的故事。","Mr. Bumble put down his hat; unbuttoned his coat; folded his arms; inclined his head in a retrospective manner; and, after a few moments’ reflection, commenced his story."
"如果我们在此复述这位教区执事的原话，得用二十多分钟，而且会让人觉得单调而乏味。反正他的大意和主旨就是，奥利弗是一个弃儿，他的父母身份都很低贱，而且品性恶劣。奥利弗从出生开始，表现出来的只有背叛、忘恩负义和心存恶意，除此之外，没有一点好的品质。在他的出生地，他曾残酷又怯懦地将一位无辜的小伙子暴打了一顿，然后夜间从主人家仓皇出逃，结束了那一段经历。为了证明自己不是个冒牌货，邦布尔先生把随身带着的几份文件放在桌子上。然后他又双臂交叉，等待布朗洛先生过目。","It would be tedious if given in the beadle’s words: occupying, as it did, some twenty minutes in the telling; but the sum and substance of it was, that Oliver was a foundling, born of low and vicious parents.That he had, from his birth, displayed no better qualities than treachery, ingratitude, and malice.That he had terminated his brief career in the place of his birth, by making a sanguinary and cowardly attack on an unoffending lad, and running away in the night-time from his master’s house.In proof of his really being the person he represented himself, Mr. Bumble laid upon the table the papers he had brought to town.Folding his arms again, he then awaited Mr. Brownlow’s observations."
"“我恐怕这一切都是真的。”布朗洛先生看完这些文件，难过地说道，“对于你提供的情况，这五几尼不算丰厚。可是如果这些信息是对那个孩子有好处的，我倒是非常愿意付你三倍于此的报酬。”","“I fear it is all too true,” said the old gentleman sorrowfully, after looking over the papers.“This is not much for your intelligence; but I would gladly have given you treble the money, if it had been favourable to the boy.”"
"要是邦布尔先生早些得知这一信息的话，他极有可能用另一番完全不同的表述来讲述奥利弗的过去。但是现在为时已晚，他也只能严肃地摇摇头，把五几尼放入钱袋，然后离开了。","It is not improbable that if Mr. Bumble had been possessed of this information at an earlier period of the interview, he might have imparted a very different colouring to his little history.It was too late to do it now, however; so he shook his head gravely, and, pocketing the five guineas, withdrew."
"布朗洛先生在屋子里踱来踱去，走了一会儿。很显然，教区执事讲的事情使他心神不宁。甚至连格林维格先生也不得不控制住自己，不去火上浇油。","Mr. Brownlow paced the room to and fro for some minutes; evidently so much disturbed by the beadle’s tale, that even Mr. Grimwig forbore to vex him further."
"最后他终于停了下来，拼命地摇铃。","At length he stopped, and rang the bell violently."
"“贝德温太太，”布朗洛先生一见到女管家，就说道，“那个孩子，奥利弗，是个骗子。”","“Mrs. Bedwin,” said Mr. Brownlow, when the housekeeper appeared; “that boy, Oliver, is an imposter.”"
"“不会的，先生。这是不可能的。”老太太斩钉截铁地说。","“It can’t be, sir.It cannot be,” said the old lady energetically."
"“我告诉你他就是。”老绅士反驳道，“你说不可能是什么意思？我们刚刚听教区执事详细讲述了他从出生以来的情况，他一直以来都是一个小混蛋。”","“I tell you he is,” retorted the old gentleman.“What do you mean by can’t be?We have just heard a full account of him from his birth; and he has been a thorough-paced little villain, all his life.”"
"“先生，反正我不信。”老太太坚定地回答，“永远不信！”","“I never will believe it, sir,” replied the old lady, firmly.“Never!”"
"“你们这些老太太就是什么都不信，只信那些江湖郎中和满嘴胡言的故事书。”格林维格先生怒吼道，“我早就知道了。你为什么不从一开始就接受我的忠告呢？我猜如果他没患热病的话，你就接受了，是不是？他挺有趣的，是不是？有趣？呸呸！”格里维格先生说着，手舞足蹈，使劲戳了戳炉子里的火。","“You old women never believe anything but quack-doctors, and lying story-books,” growled Mr. Grimwig.“I knew it all along.Why didn’t you take my advise in the beginning; you would if he hadn’t had a fever, I suppose, eh?He was interesting, wasn’t he?Interesting!Bah!”And Mr. Grimwig poked the fire with a flourish."
"“先生，他是个好孩子，知恩图报，又听话乖巧。”贝德温太太愤慨地反驳道，“我知道小孩子们是什么样子的，先生。这种事我有四十年的经验了。那些没有这么长时间经验的人，不要对他们说三道四的。这就是我的意思！”","“He was a dear, grateful, gentle child, sir,” retorted Mrs. Bedwin, indignantly.“I know what children are, sir; and have done these forty years; and people who can’t say the same, shouldn’t say anything about them. That’s my opinion!”"
"这番话对至今依旧单身的格林维格先生算是沉重一击。这位绅士只是微微一笑，没有别的反应。老太太昂着头，整了整围裙，正打算继续理论一番，却被布朗洛先生制止了。","This was a hard hit at Mr. Grimwig, who was a bachelor.As it extorted nothing from that gentleman but a smile, the old lady tossed her head, and smoothed down her apron preparatory to another speech, when she was stopped by Mr. Brownlow."
"“静一静！”老绅士装出一副自己没有觉察到的怒容，说道，“永远不要再跟我提那个孩子的名字。我敲铃就是要告诉你这个。永远！永远不要以任何理由提起他！你当心一点！你可以出去了，贝德温太太。把我的话记住了！我是很认真的。”","“Silence!” said the old gentleman, feigning an anger he was far from feeling.“Never let me hear the boy’s name again.I rang to tell you that.Never.Never, on any pretence, mind!You may leave the room, Mrs. Bedwin.Remember!I am in earnest.”"
"这天夜里，布朗洛先生家里好几颗心都被伤了。","There were sad hearts at Mr. Brownlow’s that night."
"一想起自己的那些好朋友，奥利弗的心也立马沉了下去。好在他无法知道他们所听说的事，不然他也许早就心碎了。","Oliver’s heart sank within him, when he thought of his good friends; it was well for him that he could not know what they had heard, or it might have broken outright."
"第十八章 讲述奥利弗在他那群有声望的朋友当中是如何度日的","CHAPTER XVIII How Oliver passed his time in the improving society of his reputable friends "
"第二天大约中午时分，机灵鬼和贝茨少爷便出门去干他们的老行当了。费金先生趁着这个机会，向奥利弗发表了一篇长篇演讲，对他的这种忘恩负义的罪行进行了痛斥。他清楚地表明，奥利弗的罪过实在太大了，居然忍心抛下那么多关心他的朋友。而且，在给大家惹了那么多祸，在大家花了那么多功夫找到他之后，他还一心想要逃走。费金先生重点强调了他收留、抚养奥利弗这件事，说如果当初不是他伸出援助之手，小奥利弗早已经饿死了。他还讲述了某个小伙子凄惨动人的经历。同样是出于同情，在相似的情况下，他帮助了那个小伙子，但是那个小伙子最终辜负了他的信赖，试图向警察通风报信，结果某天早晨，在“旧贝利”被绞死了。费金并没有掩饰自己跟这起惨案有关。但是他红着眼圈说，由于那位年轻人背信弃义、毫无悔过之意，所以也就不得不成为牺牲品——这些即使不全都有真凭实据——为了他（费金先生）和几位密友的安全，也是非常必要的。费金先生描述了一副令人恶心的画面，来向小奥利弗说明绞刑的种种令人不悦之处，以此作为他演讲的结尾。然后，他友好且礼貌地表达了无数殷切的希望，表示除非迫不得已，他绝对不忍心让奥利弗遭受这种令人不悦的处置。","About noon next day, when the Dodger and Master Bates had gone out to pursue their customary avocations, Mr. Fagin took the opportunity of reading Oliver a long lecture on the crying sin of ingratitude;of which he clearly demonstrated he had been guilty, to no ordinary extent, in wilfully absenting himself from the society of his anxious friends; and, still more, in endeavouring to escape from them after so much trouble and expense had been incurred in his recovery.Mr. Fagin laid great stress on the fact of his having taken Oliver in, and cherished him, when, without his timely aid, he might have perished with hunger;and he related the dismal and affecting history of a young lad whom, in his philanthropy, he had succoured under parallel circumstances, but who, proving unworthy of his confidence and evincing a desire to communicate with the police, had unfortunately come to be hanged at the Old Bailey one morning.Mr. Fagin did not seek to conceal his share in the catastrophe, but lamented with tears in his eyes that the wrong-headed and treacherous behaviour of the young person in question, had rendered it necessary that he should become the victim of certain evidence for the crown: which, if it were not precisely true, was indispensably necessary for the safety of him (Mr. Fagin) and a few select friends.Mr. Fagin concluded by drawing a rather disagreeable picture of the discomforts of hanging; and, with great friendliness and politeness of manner, expressed his anxious hopes that he might never be obliged to submit Oliver Twist to that unpleasant operation."
"小奥利弗听着犹太佬的这番话，隐隐约约地感觉到其中流露出的阴险的威胁，他全身的血都凉了。他已经明白，当清白与有罪偶然交织在一起的时候，连正义都可能将其混为一谈。对于如何除去知道太多的人或是藏不住秘密的人，这个犹太佬老谋深算，早有妙计，而且这类计划已经被他谋划并实施过不止一次了。奥利弗想起了这位绅士与赛克斯先生争吵的理由，似乎就与以往的某个这类阴谋有关。他胆怯地抬起头来，正好碰上犹太佬锐利的目光。他感觉到，这位谨慎的老绅士既没有忽视自己苍白的脸色和发抖的四肢，也没有对此失去兴趣。","Little Oliver’s blood ran cold, as he listened to the Jew’s words, and imperfectly comprehended the dark threats conveyed in them.That it was possible even for justice itself to confound the innocent with the guilty when they were in accidental companionship, he knew already; and that deeply-laid plans for the destruction of inconveniently knowing or over-communicative persons, had been really devised and carried out by the Jew on more occasions than one,he thought by no means unlikely, when he recollected the general nature of the altercations between that gentleman and Mr. Sikes: which seemed to bear reference to some foregone conspiracy of the kind.As he glanced timidly up, and met the Jew’s searching look, he felt that his pale face and trembling limbs were neither unnoticed nor unrelished by that wary old gentleman."
"犹太佬笑着拍拍奥利弗的头，样子十分令人讨厌。他说只要奥利弗安安静静，专心做事，他们仍然可以成为好朋友。说完，他戴上帽子，把一件带补丁的大衣裹在身上，走了出去，从外面把门反锁上。","The Jew, smiling hideously, patted Oliver on the head, and said, that if he kept himself quiet, and applied himself to business, he saw they would be very good friends yet.Then, taking his hat, and covering himself with an old patched great-coat, he went out, and locked the room-door behind him."
"在第二天以及接下来的很多天中，奥利弗从清早到午夜都没有再见到一个人影，同他作伴的只有自己脑海中的浮想。他无法忘记那些好心的朋友，他们可能早已用另一种眼光看待自己了。每当想到这些，他都会感到伤心。","And so Oliver remained all that day, and for the greater part of many subsequent days, seeing nobody, between early morning and midnight, and left during the long hours to commune with his own thoughts.Which, never failing to revert to his kind friends, and the opinion they must long ago have formed of him, were sad indeed."
"过了大约一周多，犹太佬不再锁门，奥利弗可以自由地在屋子周围走动了。","After the lapse of a week or so, the Jew left the room-door unlocked; and he was at liberty to wander about the house."
"这个地方非常肮脏。楼上的几个房间装有高高的木质烟囱和大门，墙上镶有护墙板，檐口一直嵌到天花板里。尽管这些东西由于无人打扫早已积满灰尘，但是依旧被点缀得千姿百态。根据这些迹象，奥利弗断定，很久之前，在犹太佬还没出生的时候，这里是属于境遇比较不错的人的。那时候这里可能相当富丽堂皇，尽管现在非常凄凉。","It was a very dirty place.The rooms upstairs had great high wooden chimney-pieces and large doors, with panelled walls and cornices to the ceiling; which, although they were black with neglect and dust, were ornamented in various ways.From all of these tokens Oliver concluded that a long time ago, before the old Jew was born, it had belonged to better people, and had perhaps been quite gay and handsome: dismal and dreary as it looked now."
"蜘蛛早已经在墙壁和天花板的角落里织好了网。有时候奥利弗轻轻走进屋子，就会发现老鼠在地板上窜来窜去，然后惊慌失措地跑回洞里。除了这些，房间里再也看不见任何别的活物，也听不到什么活物的动静了。有时当天色暗下来的时候，奥利弗从一个房间游荡到另一个房间，当他感到疲惫的时候，他便蜷缩在靠近大门的走廊角落里，尽可能靠近那些活着的人。他靠在那儿，聆听着，计算着时间，直到犹太佬和那几个少年回来。","Spiders had built their webs in the angles of the walls and ceilings; and sometimes, when Oliver walked softly into a room, the mice would scamper across the floor, and run back terrified to their holes.With these exceptions, there was neither sight nor sound of any living thing; and often, when it grew dark, and he was tired of wandering from room to room, he would crouch in the corner of the passage by the street-door, to be as near living people as he could; and would remain there, listening and counting the hours, until the Jew or the boys returned."
"所有房间的窗板都关得紧紧的，这些窗户正日渐腐烂着。压窗板的横条被螺丝牢牢地固定在木槽里。光线仅能够从房屋顶部的一个个圆孔隐约透过，使屋子里格外昏暗，布满奇形怪状的影子。后面的阁楼开着一扇窗，没有窗板，横条已经生锈。奥利弗经常满脸忧郁地向外望，一望便是几个小时。除了混杂拥挤的一片屋顶、黑乎乎的烟囱和山墙之外，再也不能分辨出别的什么东西来。有时候，透过远处房子的矮墙，确实能够看到一个灰蒙蒙的脑袋，但是眨眼功夫就会消失。由于奥利弗身前的窗户是钉死的，加上多年来雨水和浓烟的侵蚀，从窗户看出去一片朦胧不清，他顶多能把各种东西的形状分辨开来，至于试图让别人看见自己或是听到自己的声音，根本不可能。因为他目前的处境就如同呆在圣保罗大教堂的圆顶里一样。","In all the rooms, the mouldering shutters were fast closed: the bars which held them were screwed tight into the wood; the only light which was admitted, stealing its way through round holes at the top: which made the rooms more gloomy, and filled them with strange shadows.There was a back-garret window with rusty bars outside, which had no shutter; and out of this, Oliver often gazed with a melancholy face for hours together; but nothing was to be descried from it but a confused and crowded mass of housetops, blackened chimneys, and gable-ends.Sometimes, indeed, a grizzly head might be seen, peering over the parapet-wall of a distant house; but it was quickly withdrawn again; and as the window of Oliver’s observatory was nailed down, and dimmed with the rain and smoke of years, it was as much as he could do to make out the forms of the different objects beyond, without making any attempt to be seen or heard,—which he had as much chance of being, as if he had lived inside the ball of St. Paul’s Cathedral."
"一天下午，机灵鬼和贝茨少爷都在忙活着准备出门。机灵鬼突发奇想，竟对自己的打扮表示忧虑（说实话，这绝对不是他向来就存在的一个缺点）。出于这一目的，他竟然赏脸让奥利弗帮他打扮一下。","One afternoon, the Dodger and Master Bates being engaged out that evening, the first-named young gentleman took it into his head to evince some anxiety regarding the decoration of his person (to do him justice, this was by no means an habitual weakness with him); and, with this end and aim, he condescendingly commanded Oliver to assist him in his toilet, straightway."
"见自己能够派上用场，奥利弗很开心。身边有几张面孔可以看看，就算都不怎么和蔼可亲，也比一张都没有让他高兴。他很想通过老老实实做事来赢得身边这些人的信任，因此他欣然接受了机灵鬼的这一提议。他立马表示愿意效劳。机灵鬼坐到了桌子上，以便能够把他的脚搭在奥利弗的腿上。奥利弗跪在地板上，开始工作。道金斯先生称这一工序为“替脚套上光”。这句话说白了，就是替他擦鞋。","Oliver was but too glad to make himself useful; too happy to have some faces, however bad, to look upon; too desirous to conciliate those about him when he could honestly do so; to throw any objection in the way of this proposal.So he at once expressed his readiness; and, kneeling on the floor, while the Dodger sat upon the table so that he could take his foot in his laps, he applied himself to a process which Mr. Dawkins designated as “japanning his trotter-cases.”The phrase, rendered into plain English, signifieth, cleaning his boots."
"当一个人安逸地坐在桌子上，让别人替自己擦鞋，自己却抽着烟，漫不经心地将一条腿荡来荡去时，所有有理性的动物都会体验到那种自由自在、怡然自得的感觉。要知道，这样既省下了从前那样脱鞋的麻烦，又免去了穿鞋时可能的痛苦，自己的遐想也不会被打断。不过也可能是醇香的烟草抚平了机灵鬼的思绪，或者是温和的啤酒平息了他的思维活动，反正眼下他正沉浸在一种浪漫且热忱的情趣之中，这跟他的天性颇不相符。他若有所思地低头瞅了奥利弗一眼，又抬起头，缓缓地叹了口气，边走神边对贝茨少爷说道：“他不是个扒手，多么可惜啊！”","Whether it was the sense of freedom and independence which a rational animal may be supposed to feel when he sits on a table in an easy attitude smoking a pipe, swinging one leg carelessly to and fro, and having his boots cleaned all the time, without even the past trouble of having taken them off, or the prospective misery of putting them on, to disturb his reflections;or whether it was the goodness of the tobacco that soothed the feelings of the Dodger, or the mildness of the beer that mollified his thoughts; he was evidently tinctured, for the nonce, with a spice of romance and enthusiasm, foreign to his general nature.He looked down on Oliver, with a thoughtful countenance, for a brief space; and then, raising his head, and heaving a gentle sign, said, half in abstraction, and half to Master Bates: “What a pity it is he isn’t a prig!”"
"“啊！”查利·贝茨少爷说，“他不知道什么对他是好的。”","“Ah!” said Master Charles Bates; “he don’t know what’s good for him.”"
"机灵鬼又叹了一口气，吸起烟来；查利也吸起来。两个人一起吸了一会儿烟，谁都没有说话。","The Dodger sighed again, and resumed his pipe: as did Charley Bates.They both smoked, for some seconds, in silence."
"“你大概连扒手是怎么回事都不知道吧？”机灵鬼悲哀地问。","“I suppose you don’t even know what a prig is?” said the Dodger mournfully."
"“我想我知道，”奥利弗抬头回答说，“就是——你就是一个，对吗？”奥利弗打住了话头问道。","“I think I know that,” replied Oliver, looking up.“It’s s a the—; you’re one, are you not?” inquired Oliver, checking himself."
"“是啊，”机灵鬼回答，“别的行当我还瞧不上呢。”道金斯先生抒发完这一番感想，把帽子使劲抬了抬，然后死死盯着贝茨少爷，似乎希望他能够发表与此相反的看法。","“I am,” replied the Doger.“I’d scorn to be anything else.”Mr. Dawkins gave his hat a ferocious cock, after delivering this sentiment, and looked at Master Bates, as if to denote that he would feel obliged by his saying anything to the contrary."
"“我是，”机灵鬼重复道，“查利是。费金也是。赛克斯，南希，贝特都是。我们大家全是小偷，就连那只狗也是。它还是我们之中最柔和的一个呢！”","“I am,” repeated the Dodger.“So’s Charley.So’s Fagin.So’s Sikes.So’s Nancy.So’s Bet.So we all are, down to the dog.And he’s the downiest one of the lot!”"
"“也是口风最紧的一个。”查利·贝茨补充道。","“And the least given to peaching,” added Charley Bates."
"“就是在证人席上它也不会汪汪叫，怕惹事上身。就算把它绑起来，让它自己呆上个两星期，不吃不喝，它也不会吭声的。”机灵鬼说。","“He wouldn’t so much as bark in a witness-box, for fear of committing himself; no, not if you tied him up in one, and left him there without wittles for a fortnight,” said the Dodger."
"“可不是嘛。”查利评论道。","“Not a bit of it,” observed Charley."
"“这可真是一条怪狗。在有人奇怪地大笑或是歌唱的时候，它从来不在人前摆出凶猛的样子！”机灵鬼接着说。“当它听到小提琴的琴声时，从来不乱叫！而且它从来不憎恨那些跟它不是一个品种的狗！哦，它才不呢！”","“He’s a rum dog.Don’t he look fierce at any strange cove that laughs or sings when he’s in company!” pursued the Dodger.“Won’t he growl at all, when he hears a fiddle playing!And don’t he hate other dogs as ain’t of his breed!Oh, no!”"
"“它是个十足的基督徒。”查利说。","“He’s an out-and-out Christian,” said Charley."
"这话仅仅是在赞扬这头牲畜有本事，但是贝茨少爷并没意识到，这话在另一层意义上却也是一种很恰当的评价，因为世间有无数的女士和先生自称是十足的基督徒，这些人和赛克斯先生的狗之间存在着明显又奇特的相似之处。","This was merely intended as a tribute to the animal’s abilities, but it was an appropriate remark in another sense, if Master Bates had only known it; for there are a good many ladies and gentlemen, claiming to be out-and-out Christians, between whom, and Mr. Sikes’ dog, there exist strong and singular points of resemblance."
"“得了，得了。”机灵鬼把话题扯了回来。这是出于职业上的细心，这种细心总是影响着他的言行。“反正这些跟这个小孩子一点关系也没有。”","“Well, well,” said the Dodger, recurring to the point from which they had strayed: with that mindfulness of his profession which influenced all his proceedings.“This hasn’t go anything to do with young Green here.”"
"“可不是嘛。”查利说道，“奥利弗，你怎么不跟着费金干呢？”","“No more it has,” said Charley.“Why don’t you put yourself under Fagin, Oliver?”"
"“不想立即发财吗？”机灵鬼咧着嘴笑了笑，补充道。","“And make your fortune out of hand?” added the Dodger, with a grin."
"“有了钱就可以退休，就可以做上等人了。我的意思是，等到从现在开始过完四个闰年后的下一个闰年，三位一体周的第四十二个星期二。”查利·贝茨乱扯了一通。","“And so be able to retire on your property, and do the genteel: as I mean to, in the very next leap-year but four that ever comes, and the forty-second Tuesday in Trinity-week,” said Charley Bates."
"“我不喜欢做这种事情。”奥利弗胆怯地回答，“我希望他们能够放我走。我宁愿离开。”","“I don’t like it,” rejoined Oliver, timidly; “I wish they would let me go.I—I—would rather go.”"
"“费金才不愿意呢！”查利答道。","“And Fagin would RATHER not!” rejoined Charley."
"奥利弗很清楚这一点，但是他觉得如果把自己的想法吐露得更明白，可能会招致麻烦。于是他只是叹了口气，继续擦鞋。","Oliver knew this too well; but thinking it might be dangerous to express his feelings more openly, he only sighed, and went on with his boot-cleaning."
"“走！”机灵鬼喊道。“你的抱负都到哪里去了？你难道一点自尊都没有？你难道还想去投靠你的那些朋友？”","“Go!” exclaimed the Dodger.“Why, where’s your spirit?Don’t you take any pride out of yourself?Would you go and be dependent on your friends?”"
"“噢，那可真没劲！”贝茨少爷说着，从口袋里掏出两三条丝绸手绢，扔进了碗橱里，“那也太没劲了，真的。”","“Oh, blow that!” said Master Bates: drawing two or three silk handkerchiefs from his pocket, and tossing them into a cupboard, “that’s too mean; that is.”"
"“我可干不出这种事情。”机灵鬼带着鄙视的神情，傲慢地说道。“但是，你也可以扔下你的朋友，”奥利弗似笑非笑地说道，“让他们去因为你做的事情受罚啊。”","“I couldn’t do it,” said the Dodger, with an air of haughty disgust. “You can leave your friends, though,” said Oliver with a half smile; “and let them be punished for what you did.”"
"“这，”机灵鬼摇晃着烟斗说道，“这都是考虑到费金。因为警察知道我们是一道的，要是我们不够幸运，那么费金也会遇到麻烦的。就是这么回事，对吧，查利？”","“That,” rejoined the Dodger, with a wave of his pipe, “That was all out of consideration for Fagin, ’cause the traps know that we work together, and he might have got into trouble if we hadn’t made our lucky; that was the move, wasn’t it, Charley?”"
"贝茨少爷赞成地点点头，正要说话，上次奥利弗逃跑的情形突然闪现在他的脑海中，使得他刚刚吸进去的烟和他的笑声缠绕在一起，往上一个劲冲向脑门，往下一直窜到喉咙，弄得他又是咳嗽又是跺脚，折腾了五分钟左右。","Master Bates nodded assent, and would have spoken, but the recollection of Oliver’s flight came so suddenly upon him, that the smoke he was inhaling got entangled with a laugh, and went up into his head, and down into his throat: and brought on a fit of coughing and stamping, about five minutes long."
"“快瞧！”机灵鬼说着掏出一大把钱，全是些先令和半便士铜币。“这才叫快活的生活呢！谁管它们是从哪儿来的？喂，接着。那些地方钱比这多多了。你不要？真的不要？呦，你这个可爱的小傻瓜！”","“Look here!” said the Dodger, drawing forth a handful of shillings and halfpence.“Here’s a jolly life!What’s the odds where it comes from?Here, catch hold; there’s plenty more where they were took from.You won’t, won’t you?Oh, you precious flat!”"
"“真没规矩，你说是不是，奥利弗？”查利·贝茨询问道，“他会被绞死的，你说呢？”","“It’s s naughty, ain’t it, Oliver?”inquired Charley Bates.“He’ll come to be scragged, won’t he?”"
"“我不明白这是什么意思。”奥利弗回答。","“I don’t know what that means,” replied Oliver."
"“老伙计，是这个意思。”查利说道。他边说着，边抓起围巾的一端，使围巾垂直飘在空气中。他把脑袋靠在肩膀上，从牙缝里挤出一些古怪的声音，用这种哑剧形式向奥利弗示意绞刑是怎么一回事。","“Something in this way, old feller,” said Charly.As he said it, Master Bates caught up an end of his neckerchief; and, holding it erect in the air, dropped his head on his shoulder, and jerked a curious sound through his teeth; thereby indicating, by a lively pantomimic representation, that scragging and hanging were one and the same thing."
"“就是这个意思。”查利说道，“杰克，你看他眼睛瞪得多大呀！","“That’s what it means,” said Charley.“Look how he stares, Jack!"
"我从来没见过这么单纯的伙伴。他会让我笑死的。我知道他会的。”贝茨少爷又开心地大笑了一阵，笑得眼泪都出来了，他又叼起了烟斗。","I never did see such prime company as that’ere boy; he’ll be the death of me, I know he will.”Master Charley Bates, having laughed heartily again, resumed his pipe with tears in his eyes."
"“你已经被教坏了。”机灵鬼十分满意地打量着他的靴子，奥利弗已经把它们擦得铮亮。“费金会培养你成才的，不然的话，你可就成了他手头第一块没用的东西了。你最好立马就行动起来。要不然在你没想明白之前就入道了。奥利弗，你现在就是在浪费时间。”","“You’ve  been brought up bad,” said the Dodger, surveying his boots with much satisfaction when Oliver had polished them.“Fagin will make something of you, though, or you’ll be the first he ever had that turned out unprofitable.You’d better begin at once; for you’ll come to the trade long before you think of it; and you’re only losing time, Oliver.”"
"贝茨少爷把自己积攒的各种各样的道德告诫都搬了出来，以支持他的这一观点。说完后，他和他的朋友道金斯先生又热情洋溢地描述了一番他们这种生活的无尽乐趣，他们用各种各样的暗示来点化奥利弗，告诉他最好的方法就是不要再迟疑，而是用他们建议的方法去博得费金的欢心。","Master Bates backed this advice with sundry moral admonitions of his own: which, being exhausted, he and his friend Mr. Dawkins launched into a glowing description of the numerous pleasures incidental to the life they led, interspersed with a variety of hints to Oliver that the best thing he could do, would be to secure Fagin’s favour without more delay, by the means which they themselves had employed to gain it."
"“还得老是把这个放进你的烟斗里，诺利。”机灵鬼听到了犹太佬在楼上开门的声音，立马换了一个话题，“你要是没弄到手帕和怀表的话——”“你这么说有什么意义呢？”贝茨少爷打断他，说道，“他听不懂你的意思。”","“And always put this in your pipe, Nolly,” said the Dodger, as the Jew was heard unlocking the door above, “if you don’t take fogles and tickers—” “Whats the good of talking in that way?” interposed Master Bates; “he don’t know what you mean.”"
"“如果你没弄到手绢和金表的话，”机灵鬼把谈话降低到奥利弗能够听明白的范围，“别人也会弄到的。那么丢东西的人就会依旧倒霉，你也会倒霉，除了那个捞到东西的小子，其他人谁也得不到一点好处——你和他们有相同的权利去得到那些东西。”","“If you don’t take pocket-handkechers and watches,” said the Dodger, reducing his conversation to the level of Oliver’s capacity, “some other cove will; so that the coves that lose ’em will be all the worse, and you’ll be all the worse, too, and nobody half a ha“p”orth the better, except the chaps wot gets them—and you’ve  just as good a right to them as they have.”"
"“确实，确实是这样！”犹太佬说道，他进来的时候奥利弗都没有发现。“事情非常简单明了，我亲爱的孩子。简单极了，你相信机灵鬼就好了。哈哈哈！他对这一行了解得很清楚。”","“To be sure, to be sure!” said the Jew, who had entered unseen by Oliver.“It all lies in a nutshell my dear; in a nutshell, take the Dodger’s word for it.Ha! ha! ha!He understands the catechism of his trade.”"
"老犹太高兴地搓了搓手，对机灵鬼的这番推理表示赞同。看到自己的徒弟这么有出息，他开心地咯咯笑起来。","The old man rubbed his hands gleefully together, as he corroborated the Dodger’s reasoning in these terms; and chuckled with delight at his pupil’s proficiency."
"此时此刻，谈话没有继续下去，因为跟犹太佬一起回来的还有贝奇小姐和另一位奥利弗不认识的绅士。机灵鬼叫他汤姆·基特宁。这位先生在楼梯上逗留了一会儿，向这位女士献了会儿殷勤才走进来。","The conversation proceeded no farther at this time, for the Jew had returned home accompanied by Miss Betsy, and a gentleman whom Oliver had never seen before, but who was accosted by the Dodger as Tom Chitling; and who, having lingered on the stairs to exchange a few gallantries with the lady, now made his appearance."
"基特宁先生比机灵鬼大一些，约莫十八九的样子。但是他和机灵鬼在行为举止方面大相径庭，似乎表明他在天分和职业技术方面都稍稍逊色一些。他有一双闪烁的小眼睛，脸上满是痘痕，戴着一顶皮帽，身穿深色灯芯绒夹克，下身是一条沾满油污的粗布裤子，系了一条围裙。说实话，他的这身行头确实需要好好修补一下。他向在场的各位道歉，说他一个小时前才“出来”。在过去的六个星期他一直穿着制服，因此还没能够考虑便服的问题。基特宁先生充满怒气地说，那里熏蒸衣服的新方法简直是违法宪法的，不仅把衣服上熏出些窟窿，而且也没有地方去讨回公道。他对那儿的理发规定也做了相同的批评，他断然地说这些规定也是违法的。基特宁先生声称自己在过去这段又长又艰辛的四十二天里，没有碰过一滴东西，他“要是没有渴得如同一个石灰篓子的话，自己甘愿被炸成灰”。他用这段话结束了他的讲话。","Mr. Chitling was older in years than the Dodger: having perhaps numbered eighteen winters; but there was a degree of deference in his deportment towards that young gentleman which seemed to indicate that he felt himself conscious of a slight inferiority in point of genius and professional aquirements.He had small twinkling eyes, and a pock-marked face; wore a fur cap, a dark corduroy jacket, greasy fustian trousers, and an apron.His wardrobe was, in truth, rather out of repair; but he excused himself to the company by stating that his “time” was only out an hour before; and that, in consequence of having worn the regimentals for six weeks past, he had not been able to bestow any attention on his private clothes.Mr. Chitling added, with strong marks of irritation, that the new way of fumigating clothes up yonder was infernal unconstitutional, for it burnt holes in them, and there was no remedy against the County.The same remark he considered to apply to the regulation mode of cutting the hair: which he held to be decidedly unlawful.Mr. Chitling wound up his observations by stating that he had not touched a drop of anything for forty-two moral long hard-working days; and that he “wished he might be busted if he warn’t as dry as a lime-basket.”"
"“你觉得这位绅士从哪里来啊，奥利弗？”犹太佬咧嘴笑着询问道。其他孩子们都在张罗着把一瓶酒往餐桌上放。","“Where do you think the gentleman has come from, Oliver?” inquired the Jew, with a grin, as the other boys put a bottle of spirits on the table."
"“我——我——不知道，先生。”奥利弗回答。","“I—I—don’t know, sir,” replied Oliver."
"“这是谁呀？”汤姆·基特宁轻蔑地打量着奥利弗问道。","“Who’s that?” inquired Tom Chitling, casting a contemptuous look at Oliver."
"“我的一位小朋友，亲爱的。”犹太佬回答。","“A young friend of mine, my dear,” replied the Jew."
"“那他运气不错。”小伙子意味深长地望了费金一眼，说道，“别管我从哪里来，小家伙。过不了多久，你自己也会知道怎么去那儿的。我拿五先令打赌。”","“He’s in luck, then,” said the young man, with a meaning look at Fagin.“Never mind where I came from, young ’un; you’ll find your way there, soon enough, I’ll bet a crown!”"
"这句俏皮话引得男孩子们大笑起来。他们就这个话题继续开了几个玩笑。随后他们与费金说了几句，便出门了。","At this sally, the boys laughed.After some more jokes on the same subject, they exchanged a few short whispers with Fagin; and withdrew."
"这位最后来的先生与费金交谈了一会儿后，他们把椅子挪到了壁炉旁边。犹太佬把奥利弗喊到他身边坐下，将谈话引到了最能吸引听众的话题上。比方说，干他们这行巨大的优势，机灵鬼是多么聪明能干、查利·贝茨多么惹人喜欢，以及他自己多么慷慨大方等等。最后，这些话题都被论述得全面透彻、详尽无遗了，基特宁先生也说不出什么新见解了；因为在感化院呆上一两周，人一定早就精疲力尽了。贝奇小姐知趣地离开了，让大家各自休息。","After some words apart between the last comer and Fagin, they drew their chairs towards the fire; and the Jew, telling Oliver to come and sit by him, led the conversation to the topics most calculated to interest his hearers.These were, the great advantages of the trade, the proficiency of the Dodger, the amiability of Charley Bates, and the liberality of the Jew himself.At length these subjects displayed signs of being thoroughly exhausted; and Mr. Chitling did the same: for the house of correction becomes fatiguing after a week or two.Miss Betsy accordingly withdrew; and left the party to their repose."
"从这天开始，奥利弗就很少被单独留下了。他几乎始终都与两个少年在一起。他们两个每天都跟费金一起玩以前的那种游戏，这究竟是为了他们自己的进步，还是为了奥利弗好，也只有费金先生自己最清楚了。其余时间，犹太佬会给他们讲一些他自己年轻时候抢劫的故事，添加一些奇特滑稽的情节，使得奥利弗禁不住大笑起来。从这里可以看出，尽管奥利弗良心未泯，但是他确实被逗乐了。","From this day, Oliver was seldom left alone; but was placed in almost constant communication with the two boys, who played the old game with the Jew every day: whether for their own improvement or Oliver’s, Mr. Fagin best knew.At other times the old man would tell them stories of robberies he had committed in his younger days: mixed up with so much that was droll and curious, that Oliver could not help laughing heartily, and showing that he was amused in spite of all his better feelings."
"简单说，老谋深算的犹太佬已经使这个孩子落入了圈套。先是用孤独和忧郁去侵蚀这个孩子的心灵，继而让他感觉到在这样一个沉闷的地方，随便与什么人结伴都比自己一个人悲哀好。他正在将毒汁慢慢注入奥利弗的灵魂，希望能够将他的心灵变黑，永远改变它的色彩。","In short, the wily old Jew had the boy in his toils.Having prepared his mind, by solitude and gloom, to prefer any society to the companionship of his own sad thoughts in such a dreary place, he was now slowly instilling into his soul the poison which he hoped would blacken it, and change its hue for ever."
"第十九章 对一个值得留意的计划的讨论和决定","CHAPTER XIX In which a notable plan is discussed and determined on "
"这是一个寒冷潮湿的晚上，狂风怒吼着，费金扣紧外套，紧紧裹住他那干枯的身体，又将衣领翻上去盖住耳朵，将脸的下半部分也完全遮了起来。然后他走出了老窝。他在门口的台阶上停了一下，男孩们锁好了大门，又给门拴上链子。他仔细聆听着，直到确信男孩们把一切都弄安全了，他们撤退的脚步声也听不到了，才尽快沿着街道偷偷离开了。","It was a chill, damp, windy night, when the Jew: buttoning his great-coat tight round his shrivelled body, and pulling the collar up over his ears so as completely to obscure the lower part of his face: emerged from his den.He paused on the step as the door was locked and chained behind him; and having listened while the boys made all secure, and until their retreating footsteps were no longer audible, slunk down the street as quickly as he could."
"奥利弗被转移后住的这个房子，位于怀特教堂附近。犹太佬在街角停了一下，疑神疑鬼地环视了四周，穿过马路，朝着斯皮达菲方向奔去了。","The house to which Oliver had been conveyed, was in the neighborhood of Whitechapel.The Jew stopped for an instant at the corner of the street; and, glancing suspiciously round, crossed the road, and struck off in the direction of the Spitalfields."
"石子路上积了厚厚的一层泥，黑色的雾气笼罩着街道，雨点慢悠悠地飘落下来，一切东西摸上去都是冷冷的、黏黏的。这样的夜晚看上去似乎正适合犹太佬这样的人外出。他在墙壁和门洞的掩护下，偷偷摸摸地向前走着。这个面目可憎的老头看上去就像一只令人恶心的爬行动物，从泥泞黑暗的地方爬出来，趁着夜色向前爬行，想要寻找一些腐肉美美吃上一顿。","The mud lay thick upon the stones, and a black mist hung over the streets; the rain fell sluggishly down, and everything felt cold and clammy to the touch.It seemed just the night when it befitted such a being as the Jew to be abroad.As he glided stealthily along, creeping beneath the shelter of the walls and doorways, the hideous old man seemed like some loathsome reptile, engendered in the slime and darkness through which he moved: crawling forth, by night, in search of some rich offal for a meal."
"他继续向前走，穿过了一条条曲折狭窄的小路，到达贝丝勒尔草地，然后突然向左一转，闪进了由肮脏破败的小巷子组成的迷宫。这样的迷宫在这个封闭且人口稠密的地方随处可见。","He kept on his course, through many winding and narrow ways, until he reached Bethnal Green; then, turning suddenly off to the left, he soon became involved in a maze of the mean and dirty streets which abound in that close and densely-populated quarter."
"犹太佬对这个地方显然很熟悉，不会因为夜色黑暗或者道路复杂而迷路。他匆匆穿过几条小巷和街道，最后转进一条小巷子，在这里，只有巷子尽头的一盏孤灯发着微弱的光。犹太佬走到一所房子前敲了敲门，然后跟开门的人嘀咕了几句，便上楼了。","The Jew was evidently too familiar with the ground he traversed to be at all bewildered, either by the darkness of the night, or the intricacies of the way.He hurried through several alleys and streets, and at length turned into one, lighted only by a single lamp at the farther end.At the door of a house in this street, he knocked; having exchanged a few muttered words with the person who opened it, he walked upstairs."
"他的手刚刚碰到门把手，一只狗便开始狂叫起来。一个男人的声音传了过来，询问他是谁。","A dog growled as he touched the handle of a room-door; and a man’s voice demanded who was there."
"“我啊，比尔。就我一个人，亲爱的。”犹太佬边说边向屋内望去。","“Only me, Bill; only me, my dear,” said the Jew looking in."
"“进来吧。”赛克斯说道，“趴下，你这蠢货！这恶棍就是穿了件大衣，你就不认识了？”","“Bring in your body then,” said Sikes.“Lie down, you stupid brute!Don’t you know the devil when he’s got a great-coat on?”"
"显然，刚刚这条狗被费金的外套大衣给蒙骗了。因为当费金脱下了大衣，扔到椅背上，狗就立马退到它本来呆的角落里去了。它边走还边摇晃尾巴，来表示自己的友好。这也是狗的本性嘛。","Apparently, the dog had been somewhat deceived by Mr. Fagin’s outer garment; for as the Jew unbuttoned it, and threw it over the back of a chair, he retired to the corner from which he had risen: wagging his tail as he went, to show that he was as well satisfied as it was in his nature to be."
"“不错！”赛克斯说。","“Well!” said Sikes."
"“不错，亲爱的。”犹太佬回答，“啊！南希。”","“Well, my dear,” replied the Jew.—“Ah!Nancy.”"
"后一句认出南希的话口气相当尴尬，说明他也不知道对方会不会搭理自己。因为自从南希护着奥利弗的那件事情发生后，费金先生跟这位女士还未曾见过面。要是他在这个问题上有疑惑的话，这些疑惑也立刻被这位年轻女子的行为举止消除了。她抬起了搁在壁炉挡板上的脚，把自己坐的椅子往后拖了拖，让费金把他的椅子往前凑凑，除此之外，没有再说什么。这确实是一个寒冷的夜晚啊。","The latter recognition was uttered with just enough of embarrassment to imply a doubt of its reception; for Mr. Fagin and his young friend had not met, since she had interfered in behalf of Oliver.All doubts upon the subject, if he had any, were speedily removed by the young lady’s behaviour.She took her feet off the fender, pushed back her chair, and bade Fagin draw up his, without saying more about it: for it was a cold night, and no mistake."
"“真冷啊，亲爱的南希。”费金说着，将他瘦骨嶙峋的手凑在火上烘烤着。“冷得像要把人扎穿一样。”犹太佬揉揉自己的腰，补充道。","“It is cold, Nancy dear,” said the Jew, as he warmed his skinny hands over the fire.“It seems to go right through one,” added the old man, touching his side."
"“能扎穿你的心的东西，非得是锥子才行。”赛克斯说道，“南希，给他点喝的。见鬼了，快点！你瞧瞧他副干瘪的老骨头，都抖成什么样子了。简直就跟刚从坟墓里爬出来的丑鬼似的，真让人恶心。”","“It must be a piercer, if it finds its way through your heart,” said Mr. Sikes.“Give him something to drink, Nancy.Burn my body, make haste! it’s enough to turn a man ill, to see his lean old carcase shivering in that way, like a ugly ghost just rose from the grave.”"
"南希迅速地从碗柜里取来一个瓶子，碗柜里还放着好多这样的瓶子。从它们五花八门的外表来看，盛的是各种各样的饮料。赛克斯倒了一杯白兰地，让犹太佬干了它。","Nancy quickly brought a bottle from a cupboard, in which there were many: which, to judge from the diversity of their appearance, were filled with several kinds of liquids.Sikes pouring out a glass of brandy, bade the Jew drink it off."
"“够了，够了，比尔，谢谢了。”费金端起酒杯在嘴边碰了碰，便放下了。","“Quite enough, quite, thankye, Bill,” replied the Jew, putting down the glass after just setting his lips to it."
"“怎么！怕我们把你打败，是不是？”赛克斯死死盯着犹太佬问道，“唔！”","“What! You’re afraid of our getting the better of you, are you?” inquired Sikes, fixing his eyes on the Jew.“Ugh!”"
"赛克斯带着鄙视发出一声沙哑的嘟囔声，抓起酒杯，把里面的酒泼到炉灰里，然后又替自己重新盛了一杯，一饮而尽，以此作为他给费金的见面礼。","With a hoarse grunt of contempt, Mr. Sikes seized the glass, and threw the remainder of its contents into the ashes: as a preparatory ceremony to filling it again for himself: which he did at once."
"犹太佬趁着同伴喝第二杯的时候，环视了屋子一圈——倒不是出于好奇，因为他之前时常光顾这个屋子，而是出于一种闲不住且爱猜疑的习惯。这公寓布置得十分简陋，只有橱柜里的东西表明屋子里的人绝非是靠正常工作吃饭的人。屋子角落里放着两三根沉甸甸的大头短棒，一把“保命器”挂在壁炉架上。除此之外，再也没有别的看起来让人怀疑的东西了。","The Jew glanced round the room, as his companion tossed down the second glassful; not in curiousity, for he had seen it often before; but in a restless and suspicious manner habitual to him.It was a meanly furnished apartment, with nothing but the contents of the closet to induce the belief that its occupier was anything but a working man; and with no more suspicious articles displayed to view than two or three heavy bludgeons which stood in a corner, and a “life-preserver” that hung over the chimney-piece."
"“喂，”赛克斯咂着嘴说道，“我可是准备好了。”","“There,” said Sikes, smacking his lips.“Now I’m ready.”"
"“谈生意？”犹太佬询问道。","“For business?”inquired the Jew."
"“谈生意。”赛克斯回答，“有话就说吧。”","“For business,” replied Sikes; “so say what you’ve  got to say.”"
"“是关于彻特西的那户吧，比尔？”费金把椅子拉近了一些，声音很低。","“About the crib at Chertsey, Bill?” said the Jew, drawing his chair forward, and speaking in a very low voice."
"“对。你觉得怎么样啊？” 赛克斯询问。","“Yes.Wot about it?” inquired Sikes."
"“啊！你明白我的意思，亲爱的。”犹太佬说，“他明白我的意思，是吧，南希？”","“Ah! you know what I mean, my dear,” said the Jew.“He knows what I mean, Nancy; don’t he?”"
"“不，不明白，”赛克斯冷冷一笑，“或者说是不想知道。这都是一回事。说吧，有什么话就直说。别光坐在那儿眨眼睛，跟我打哑谜。就好像你不是第一个盘算抢劫的人似的。你打算怎么样？”","“No, he don’t,” sneered Mr. Sikes.“Or he won’t, and that’s the same thing.Speak out, and call things by their right names; don’t sit there, winking and blinking, and talking to me in hints, as if you warn’t the very first that thought about the robbery.Wot d’ye mean?”"
"“嘘，比尔，你小声点！”犹太佬本想止住比尔的怒气，但是没有成功，“别人会听见的，亲爱的。有人会听见的。”","“Hush, Bill, hush!” said the Jew, who had in vain attempted to stop this burst of indignation; “somebody will hear us, my dear.Somebody will hear us.”"
"“那就让他们听好了！”赛克斯说道，“我才不在乎呢。”但是深思了一会儿后，赛克斯还是把声音压低了一些，也平静了许多，因为他不可能不在乎。","“Let ’em hear!” said Sikes; “I don’t care.”But as Mr. Sikes DID care, on reflection, he dropped his voice as he said the words, and grew calmer."
"“这个，这个，”费金哄道，“我就是提醒一下，没有别的。这个，我亲爱的，咱们谈谈彻特西的那家吧。你看什么时候动手啊，比尔，嗯？什么时候动手？那些杯杯盘盘的，亲爱的，真是太好了！”费金说着，乐得直搓手，眉毛也向上扬了起来，就像这些东西已经到手了似的。","“There, there,” said the Jew, coaxingly.“It was only my caution, nothing more.Now, my dear, about that crib at Chertsey; when is it to be done, Bill, eh?When is it to be done?Such plate, my dear, such plate!” said the Jew: rubbing his hands, and elevating his eyebrows in a rapture of anticipation."
"“不干了。”赛克斯冷冷地答道。","“Not at all,” replied Sikes coldly."
"“一点也不干了？”费金重复道，向后倚到椅子上。","“Not to be done at all!” echoed the Jew, leaning back in his chair."
"“是的，真的不干了。”赛克斯回答道，“至少不会像我们想的那样，来个里应外合。”","“No, not at all,” rejoined Sikes.“At least it can’t be a put-up job, as we expected.”"
"“那就是我们本事不够。”费金气得脸色发青，说道，“别跟我说这些！”","“Then it hasn’t been properly gone about,” said the Jew, turning pale with anger.“Don’t tell me!”"
"“但是，我就是得给你说这些，”赛克斯反驳道，“你算老几，还不能让我给你说这些？我跟你说吧，托比·格拉基特在那个场子附近已经转悠了两周了，连一个仆人也没有勾搭上。”","“But I will tell you,” retorted Sikes.“Who are you that’s not to be told?I tell you that Toby Crackit has been hanging about the place for a fortnight, and he can’t get one of the servants in line.”"
"“比尔，你是不是想告诉我，”犹太佬见对方激动了，便软了下来，“那家的那两个仆人，一个也拉拢不过来？”","“Do you mean to tell me, Bill,” said the Jew: softening as the other grew heated: “that neither of the two men in the house can be got over?”"
"“是的，我就是想告诉你这事。”赛克斯回答，“他们跟了那个老太太二十年了，你就是给他们五百镑，他们也不会干的。”","“Yes, I do mean to tell you so,” replied Sikes.“The old lady has had ’em these twenty years; and if you were to give ’em five hundred pound, they wouldn’t be in it.”"
"“不过，亲爱的，那是不是说，”老犹太说，“那几个娘们儿也拉拢不过来啊？”","“But do you mean to say, my dear,” remonstrated the Jew, “that the women can’t be got over?”"
"“连想都别想。”赛克斯回答。","“Not a bit of it,” replied Sikes."
"“连狡猾的托比·格拉基特也办不到？”犹太佬怀疑地问道，“想想娘们儿都是些什么人啊，比尔。”“办不到啊，就连狡猾的托比·格拉基特也不行，”赛克斯回答，“他说他这一阵子一直戴着假胡子，穿着淡黄色的背心，一有时间就在那儿周围游荡，可是一点用也没有。”","“Not by flash Toby Crackit?” said the Jew incredulously.“Think what women are, Bill,” “No; not even by flash Toby Crackit,” replied Sikes.“He says he’s worn sham whiskers, and a canary waistcoat, the whole blessed time he’s been loitering down there, and it’s all of no use.”"
"“他应该试试小胡子，再配上军裤，亲爱的。”犹太佬说道。","“He should have tried mustachios and a pair of military trousers, my dear,” said the Jew."
"“他已经试过了，”赛克斯答道，“这样也好不到哪里去。”","“So he did,” rejoined Sikes, “and they warn’t of no more use than the other plant.”"
"听到这个消息，老犹太面无表情了。他耷拉着脸，下巴都快够着胸了。沉思了一会儿，他抬起头来，深深地叹了一口气，说如果狡猾的托比·格拉基特报告的消息准确的话，恐怕这招就真的没戏了。","The Jew looked blank at this information.After ruminating for some minutes with his chin sunk on his breast, he raised his head and said, with a deep sigh, that if flash Toby Crackit reported aright, he feared the game was up."
"“可是，”老头将双手放在膝盖上说，“这确实是一件令人伤心的事情。亲爱的，想想之前我们把心思全都放在这个上面，赔进去多少啊。”","“And yet,” said the old man, dropping his hands on his knees, “it’s a sad thing, my dear, to lose so much when we had set our hearts upon it.”"
"“可不是嘛，”赛克斯先生说，“可真是倒霉透了！”","“So it is,” said Mr. Sikes.“Worse luck!”"
"接下来，便是一阵长时间的沉默。犹太佬陷入了沉思，他面部表情扭曲，一副着了魔的邪恶样子。赛克斯不时地偷偷瞅他一眼。南希显然是怕招惹这个强盗。她坐在一旁，两眼始终盯着火，就像什么都没有听到似的。","A long silence ensued; during which the Jew was plunged in deep thought, with his face wrinkled into an expression of villainy perfectly demoniacal.Sikes eyed him furtively from time to time.Nancy, apparently fearful of irritating the housebreaker, sat with her eyes fixed upon the fire, as if she had been deaf to all that passed."
"“费金，”赛克斯突然打破了沉静，“如果从外面下手，外加五十个金币，值不值？”","“Fagin,” said Sikes, abruptly breaking the stillness that prevailed; “is it worth fifty shiners extra, if it’s safely done from the outside?”"
"“值啊。”费金就像突然醒过来一样，回答道。","“Yes,” said the Jew, as suddenly rousing himself."
"“那就这么说定了？”赛克斯问。","“Is it a bargain?”inquired Sikes."
"“恩，说定了。亲爱的，说定了。”这一番询问使犹太佬兴奋起来，他两眼放光，脸上每一块肌肉都在抖动。","“Yes, my dear, yes,” rejoined the Jew; his eyes glistening, and every muscle in his face working, with the excitement that the inquiry had awakened."
"“那好，”赛克斯带着几分轻蔑地推开犹太佬的手，说道，“你爱什么时候动手就什么时候动手吧。前天晚上，我跟托比翻过花园围墙，试了试门和窗的嵌板。这家晚上门窗关得就跟大牢似的。不过有个地方我们能够砸开，又安全又轻松。”","“Then,” said Sikes, thrusting aside the Jew’s hand, with some disdain, “let it come off as soon as you like.Toby and me were over the garden-wall the night afore last, sounding the panels of the door and shutters.The crib’s barred up at night like a jail; but there’s one part we can crack, safe and softly.”"
"“比尔，哪个地方？”犹太佬急切地问。","“Which is that, Bill?” asked the Jew eagerly."
"“这个，”赛克斯耳语道，“你穿过草地——”“是吗？”犹太佬边说边将脑袋探过去，眼珠子几乎要瞪出来了。","“Why,” whispered Sikes, “as you cross the lawn—” “Yes?” said the Jew, bending his head forward, with his eyes almost starting out of it."
"“啊！”赛克斯突然打住了，叫了起来，因为南希微微地摇了摇头。赛克斯猛然回头看了一眼，又转向了费金。“管它是什么地方。反正离开我你做不了这事。这点我心里有数。不过跟你打交道，还是得小心为妙。”","“Umph!” cried Sikes, stopping short, as the girl, scarcely moving her head, looked suddenly round, and pointed for an instant to the Jew’s face.“Never mind which part it is.You can’t do it without me, I know; but it’s best to be on the safe side when one deals with you.”"
"“随你便吧，我亲爱的，随你便。”犹太佬答道，“你和托比不要别的帮手了？”","“As you like, my dear, as you like,” replied the Jew.“Is there no help wanted, but yours and Toby’s?”"
"“不要了，”赛克斯说，“还得要一个摇柄钻跟一个小孩。摇柄钻我们两个都有，你得给我们物色个小孩。”","“None,” said Sikes.“Cept a centre-bit and a boy.The first we’ve  both got; the second you must find us.”"
"“小孩！”费金大叫起来，“噢！那就是嵌板了，嗯？”","“A boy!” exclaimed the Jew.“Oh! then it’s a panel, eh?”"
"“你不用管它是什么！”赛克斯回答，“我需要一个小孩，个头不能太大。“天哪！”赛克斯若有所思，“我要是能把烟囱清扫夫内德的那个小伙计搞到手就好了！他故意不让他长大，好让他一直干这一行。但是孩子的爸爸不让他继续干这个了。再往后，少年罪犯感化会就来把孩子带走了，教他读书写字，早晚要把他培养成一个学徒什么的。他们老是这样。”赛克斯想起自己的损失，再次火冒三丈，“还真是没个完了。要是他们得到足够的资金（谢天谢地，他们资金不够），只要一两年的功夫，我们这个行业连半打男孩子都凑不齐了。”","“Never mind wot it is!” replied Sikes.“I want a boy, and he musn’t be a big ’un.Lord!” said Mr. Sikes, reflectively, “if I’d only got that young boy of Ned, the chimbley-sweeper’s!He kept him small on purpose, and let him out by the job.But the father gets lagged; and then the Juvenile Delinquent Society comes, and takes the boy away from a trade where he was earning money, teaches him to read and write, and in time makes a ’prentice of him.And so they go on,” said Mr. Sikes, his wrath rising with the recollection of his wrongs, “so they go on; and, if they’d got money enough (which it’s a Providence they haven’t,) we shouldn’t have half a dozen boys left in the whole trade, in a year or two.”"
"“是凑不齐啊，”犹太佬随声附和道。在赛克斯慷慨陈词的时候，他一直在想自己的心事，只听清了最后一句。“比尔！”","“No more we should,” acquiesced the Jew, who had been considering during this speech, and had only caught the last sentence.“Bill!”"
"“怎么了？”赛克斯问。","“What now?” inquired Sikes."
"犹太佬朝着依旧盯着炉火发呆的南希点点头，以此暗示南希离开这个房间。赛克斯不耐烦地耸了耸肩，彷佛认为这种谨慎是不必要的。不过，他还是同意了，要南希姑娘去给他取一罐啤酒来。","The Jew nodded his head towards Nancy, who was still gazing at the fire; and intimated, by a sign, that he would have her told to leave the room.Sikes shrugged his shoulders impatiently, as if he thought the precaution unnecessary; but complied, nevertheless, by requesting Miss Nancy to fetch him a jug of beer."
"“你根本就不需要什么啤酒。”南希双手交叉，镇定地坐在座位上，一动不动。","“You don’t want any beer,” said Nancy, folding her arms, and retaining her seat very composedly."
"“我告诉你我要！”赛克斯答道。","“I tell you I do!”replied Sikes."
"“胡说八道，”姑娘冷冷地反驳道，“费金，继续说。比尔，我知道他要说什么。他没必要提防着我。”","“Nonsense,” rejoined the girl coolly, “Go on, Fagin.I know what he’s going to say, Bill; he needn’t mind me.”"
"犹太佬依旧在犹豫。赛克斯看看犹太佬，又望望南希，有些吃惊。","The Jew still hesitated.Sikes looked from one to the other in some surprise."
"“喂，费金，你别担心这个老姑娘了，行不行？”他最后问道，“你认识她也不是一天两天了。你该相信她，否则就是其中有鬼。她不会乱嚼舌头的。是吧，南希？”","“Why, you don’t mind the old girl, do you, Fagin?” he asked at length.“You’ve known her long enough to trust her, or the Devil’s in it.She ain’t one to blab.Are you Nancy?”"
"“我看是不会的！”年轻姑娘回答道。她把椅子拖到桌子旁边，把胳膊肘支在桌子上。","“I should think not!” replied the young lady: drawing her chair up to the table, and putting her elbows upon it."
"“不，当然不。亲爱的，我知道你不会，”犹太佬说，“只是——”老头说到这儿又停了下来。","“No, no, my dear, I know you’re not,” said the Jew; “but—” and again the old man paused."
"“只是什么？”赛克斯问。","“But wot?” inquired Sikes."
"“我不确定她是不是又会疯疯癫癫，亲爱的，你是知道的，像那天晚上那样。”犹太佬回答。","“I didn’t know whether she mightn’t p’raps be out of sorts, you know, my dear, as she was the other night,” replied the Jew."
"听到这话，南希大笑起来。她一口气喝下了一杯白兰地，挑衅地摇了摇头，嘴里嚷嚷着“咱们接着玩！”“千万别泄气！”等等。这一行为在两位绅士那儿奏效了。犹太佬满意地点点头，两人重新坐定。","At this confession, Miss Nancy burst into a loud laugh; and, swallowing a glass of brandy, shook her head with an air of defiance, and burst into sundry exclamations of “Keep the game a-going!” “Never say die!” and the like.These seemed to have the effect of re-assuring both gentlemen; for the Jew nodded his head with a satisfied air, and resumed his seat: as did Mr. Sikes likewise."
"“好了，费金，”南希笑嘻嘻地说，“马上告诉比尔关于奥利弗的事情吧！”","“Now, Fagin,” said Nancy with a laugh.“Tell Bill at once, about Oliver!”"
"“哈！你可真是聪明啊，亲爱的。算是我见过的姑娘中最聪明的一个了！”犹太佬说着，拍了拍她的脖子，“确实，我要说的就是奥利弗的事情。哈哈哈！”","“Ha! you’re a clever one, my dear: the sharpest girl I ever saw!” said the Jew, patting her on the neck.“It WAS about Oliver I was going to speak, sure enough.Ha! ha! ha!”"
"“他怎么了？”赛克斯问。","“What about him?” demanded Sikes."
"“他正是你所需要的孩子，亲爱的。”犹太佬压低了声音，将一根手指放在鼻子的一侧，面色狰狞地笑着。","“He’s the boy for you, my dear,” replied the Jew in a hoarse whisper; laying his finger on the side of his nose, and grinning frightfully."
"“他！”赛克斯嚷起来。","“He!” exclaimed Sikes."
"“带上他，比尔。”南希说，“我要是你的话，我就这么办。他不像其他小鬼那么有本事。不过你也不需要他多有本事，能帮你打开一扇门就行了。放心吧，他是个可靠的孩子，比尔。”","“Have him, Bill!” said Nancy.“I would, if I was in your place.He mayn’t be so much up, as any of the others; but that’s not what you want, if he’s only to open a door for you.Depend upon it he’s a safe one, Bill.”"
"“我知道他错不了的。”费金接着说，“在过去几个周里，他受到了很好的训练，也该是时候让他做点事情养活自己了。再说了，其他人个子都太大了。”","“I know he is,” rejoined Fagin.“He’s been in good training these last few weeks, and it’s time he began to work for his bread.Besides, the others are all too big.”"
"“嗯，他的个子倒是正合适，”赛克斯先生若有所思地说道。","“Well, he is just the size I want,” said Mr. Sikes, ruminating."
"“而且什么事情都会替你做，亲爱的比尔，”费金插嘴说道，“干不干这可由不得他。也就是说，只要你吓唬吓唬他。”","“And will do everything you want, Bill, my dear,” interposed the Jew; “he can’t help himself.That is, if you frighten him enough.”"
"“吓唬他！”赛克斯重复道。“我得先提醒你，到时候可不是做做吓唬的样子。一旦我们开始了工作，要是他耍什么花招的话，一不做，二不休，你就别想看着他活着回来，费金。考虑好了，你再让他去。你可听明白了！”这强盗说完，掂了掂刚从床底下抽出来的一根铁撬。","“Frighten him!” echoed Sikes.“It’ll be no sham frightening, mind you.If there’s anything queer about him when we once get into the work; in for a penny, in for a pound.You won’t see him alive again, Fagin.Think of that, before you send him.Mark my words!” said the robber, poising a crowbar, which he had drawn from under the bedstead."
"“我已经都想过了。”费金兴致勃勃地说，“我已经——已经考察过他了，亲爱的，周密地——非常周密地考察过了。只要让他感觉到他是我们的一员，只要让他有这个想法，他就已经是一个小偷了，他就已经是我们的人了。一辈子都是我们的人。呵呵！这简直是再好不过了！”老头双手交叉着放在胸前，脑袋和肩缩成一团，整个人都被高兴团团环绕住了。","“I’ve thought of it all,” said the Jew with energy.“I’ve—I’ve had my eye upon him, my dears, close—close.Once let him feel that he is one of us; once fill his mind with the idea that he has been a thief; and he’s ours!Ours for his life.Oho!It couldn’t have come about better!”The old man crossed his arms upon his breast; and, drawing his head and shoulders into a heap, literally hugged himself for joy."
"“我们的？”赛克斯说，“你的意思是，你的吧。”","“Ours!” said Sikes.“Yours, you mean.”"
"“可能吧，亲爱的。”犹太佬发出一阵刺耳的笑声，说道，“只要你高兴，算我的也行，比尔。”","“Perhaps I do, my dear,” said the Jew, with a shrill chuckle.“Mine, if you like, Bill.”"
"“为什么，”赛克斯脸色变得阴沉昏暗，瞪着自己这位和蔼可亲的搭档，“为什么你这么舍得花力气在一个脸色白得像粉笔的孩子身上？你知道的，每天夜里都有五十多个孩子在公园附近打盹，随便你怎么挑怎么选。”","“And wot,” said Sikes, scowling fiercely on his agreeable friend, “wot makes you take so much pains about one chalk-faced kid, when you know there are fifty boys snoozing about Common Garden every night, as you might pick and choose from?”"
"“因为他们对我一点用都没有，亲爱的。”犹太佬忐忑不安地回答，“他们不值得我留着。一旦出事，光看他们那长相，就足以判他们的罪。我到时候就是竹篮打水一场空了。这个男孩呢，只要调教得好，我亲爱的，他们二十个人也办不了的事情，我也能办到。而且，”犹太佬渐渐恢复了平静，“他要是出卖了我们，我们就惨了。所以他必须得跟我们呆在一条船上。你别管他是怎么走到那一步的。我有的是办法让他干抢劫这一行，这是我期待的。现在，这可比迫不得已地干掉那个孩子强多了。那样干不仅很危险，而且我们也很吃亏啊。”","“Because they’re of no use to me, my dear,” replied the Jew, with some confusion, “not worth the taking.Their looks convict ’em when they get into trouble, and I lose ’em all.With this boy, properly managed, my dears, I could do what I couldn’t with twenty of them.Besides,” said the Jew, recovering his self-possession, “he has us now if he could only give us leg-bail again; and he must be in the same boat with us.Never mind how he came there; it’s quite enough for my power over him that he was in a robbery; that’s all I want.Now, how much better this is, than being obliged to put the poor leetle boy out of the way—which would be dangerous, and we should lose by it besides.”"
"“那什么时候下手呢？”南希问道，阻止了赛克斯先生的大喊大叫。他正准备对费金的虚情假意表示恶心。","“When is it to be done?” asked Nancy, stopping some turbulent exclamation on the part of Mr. Sikes, expressive of the disgust with which he received Fagin’s affectation of humanity."
"“啊，这得说定，”犹太佬说，“比尔，什么时候动手呢？”","“Ah, to be sure,” said the Jew; “when is it to be done, Bill?”"
"“我跟托比商量过了，定在后天晚上，”赛克斯阴沉着脸回答，“要是我没有另外通知他的话。”","“I planned with Toby, the night arter to-morrow,” rejoined Sikes in a surly voice, “if he heard nothing from me to the contrairy.”"
"“好，”费金说，“那天没有月亮。”","“Good,” said the Jew; “there’s no moon.”"
"“对。”赛克斯应声说。","“No,” rejoined Sikes."
"“怎么把那些赃物弄出来也都安排妥了，是吧？”犹太佬问。 ","“It’s all arranged about bringing off the swag, is it?” asked the Jew."
"赛克斯点点头。","Sikes nodded."
"“还有那——”“噢，呃，都已经安排好了，”赛克斯打断他，回答道，“你就别打听细节了。你最好明天晚上把那个小子带过来。我天亮后一个小时出发。你别多嘴，把焊锅准备好，需要你做的只有这个。”","“And about—” “Oh, ah, it’s all planned,” rejoined Sikes, interrupting him.“Never mind particulars.You’d better bring the boy here to-morrow night.I shall get off the stone an hour arter daybreak.Then you hold your tongue, and keep the melting-pot ready, and that’s all you’ll have to do.”"
"三个人你一言我一语地讨论了一会儿后，决定由南希第二天天黑的时候前往费金的住处，将奥利弗接过来。费金阴险地说，如果奥利弗对这一任务表示厌恶的话，他应该更加乐意跟着前不久刚刚护卫过自己的南希姑娘走一趟。他们还严肃地决定，为了这一次考虑周密的行动着想，可怜的小奥利弗将无条件地托付给威廉·赛克斯先生照顾和监护，而且赛克斯先生应该按其认为妥当的方式对其作出安排。对于可能降临到那个孩子身上的任何不幸或者可能出现的惩罚，赛克斯先生均不向犹太佬承担责任。为使此协议具有约束力，双方达成谅解，赛克斯先生返回后做的所有陈述，在一切重要细节上，均须由狡猾的托比·格拉基特加以证实和确认。","After some discussion, in which all three took an active part, it was decided that Nancy should repair to the Jew’s next evening when the night had set in, and bring Oliver away with her; Fagin craftily observing, that, if he evinced any disinclination to the task, he would be more willing to accompany the girl who had so recently interfered in his behalf, than anybody else.It was also solemnly arranged that poor Oliver should, for the purposes of the contemplated expedition, be unreservedly consigned to the care and custody of Mr. William Sikes; and further, that the said Sikes should deal with him as he thought fit;and should not be held responsible by the Jew for any mischance or evil that might be necessary to visit him: it being understood that, to render the compact in this respect binding, any representations made by Mr. Sikes on his return should be required to be confirmed and corroborated, in all important particulars, by the testimony of flash Toby Crackit."
"这些初期工作安排好后，赛克斯先生开始疯狂地畅饮白兰地，还把铁撬挥舞得很吓人，不停地嚎叫。这嚎叫中既有完全不着调的歌曲片段，也有不堪入耳的诅咒谩骂。最后，出于职业热情，他坚持要去把他撬锁的工具箱拿出来。没多久，他果然拎着箱子摇摇晃晃地走了进来。他打开箱子，正准备向大家一一介绍这些工具的性能特征和构造方面的独特妙处，便倒在地板上，趴在箱子上睡着了。","These preliminaries adjusted, Mr. Sikes proceeded to drink brandy at a furious rate, and to flourish the crowbar in an alarming manner; yelling forth, at the same time, most unmusical snatches of song, mingled with wild execrations.At length, in a fit of professional enthusiasm, he insisted upon producing his box of housebreaking tools: which he had no sooner stumbled in with, and opened for the purpose of explaining the nature and properties of the various implements it contained, and the peculiar beauties of their construction, than he fell over the box upon the floor, and went to sleep where he fell."
"“晚安，南希，”犹太佬说着，像来的时候那样将自己裹了起来。","“Good-night, Nancy,” said the Jew, muffling himself up as before."
"“晚安。”","“Good-night.”"
"两人目光相遇，犹太佬认认真真地打量了她一番。姑娘丝毫没有畏缩。在这件事情上，她像托比·格拉基特一样诚实和认真。","Their eyes met, and the Jew scrutinised her, narrowly.There was no flinching about the girl.She was as true and earnest in the matter as Toby Crackit himself could be."
"犹太佬再次跟她道了声晚安，趁着南希转身的功夫，偷偷地踹了躺在地上的赛克斯一脚，然后在摸索中下楼了。","The Jew again bade her good-night, and, bestowing a sly kick upon the prostrate form of Mr. Sikes while her back was turned, groped downstairs."
"“老是这样！”老犹太一边往家走，一边低声自言自语道，“这些臭娘们儿，最大的问题就是，一件小事也会让她们想起某种已忘却许久的感情。最大的优点呢，就是这感情绝对持续不长。哈哈！那家伙为了一袋子金币，对付那个孩子！”","“Always the way!” muttered the Jew to himself as he turned homeward.“The worst of these women is, that a very little thing serves to call up some long-forgotten feeling; and, the best of them is, that it never lasts.Ha! ha!The man against the child, for a bag of gold!”"
"费金往回走着，靠着这些愉快的回忆消磨时间。他走过泥潭，回到了自己阴沉的老窝。机灵鬼还没有睡，正急躁地等着他回来。","Beguiling the time with these pleasant reflections, Mr. Fagin wended his way, through mud and mire, to his gloomy abode: where the Dodger was sitting up, impatiently awaiting his return."
"“奥利弗睡了吗？我有话跟他说。”这是他们下楼时他说的第一句话。","“Is Oliver a-bed?I want to speak to him,” was his first remark as they descended the stairs."
"“睡了好几个小时了。”机灵鬼推开一扇门，回答道，“在这儿呢！”","“Hours ago,” replied the Dodger, throwing open a door.“Here he is!”"
"奥利弗躺在一张粗糙的床上，睡得很熟。他早已被焦虑、悲伤、以及这密闭的监狱折磨得面色苍白，像是死了一般。不是那种裹上寿衣放进棺材的死者的样子，而是那种生命刚结束时的情形。弱小柔软的灵魂在瞬间飞向了天国，尘世间粗俗龌龊的气息还未来得及玷污这正在升华的圣体。","The boy was lying, fast asleep, on a rude bed upon the floor; so pale with anxiety, and sadness, and the closeness of his prison, that he looked like death;not death as it shows in shroud and coffin, but in the guise it wears when life has just departed; when a young and gentle spirit has, but an instant, fled to Heaven, and the gross air of the world has not had time to breathe upon the changing dust it hallowed."
"“现在不说了，”费金转身轻轻离去，“明天吧。明天再说。”","“Not now,” said the Jew, turning softly away.“To-morrow.To-morrow.”"
"第二十章 讲述奥利弗是如何被托付给威廉·赛克斯先生的","CHAPTER XX Wherein Oliver is delivered over to Mr. William Sikes "
"奥利弗早上醒来的时候，非常惊奇地发现自己的旧鞋子不见了，床边取而代之的是一双崭新的厚底鞋。对于这一发现，他刚开始感到很开心，以为这是预示着自己获得自由的好兆头。但是当他坐下来跟犹太佬一起吃早饭时，这些念头便迅速消失了。犹太佬告诉他，晚上要送他到比尔·赛克斯那里去。他说话的口气与神色使小奥利弗变得更加惊慌。","When Oliver awoke in the morning, he was a good deal surprised to find that a new pair of shoes, with strong thick soles, had been placed at his bedside; and that his old shoes had been removed.At first, he was pleased with the discovery: hoping that it might be the forerunner of his release; but such thoughts were quickly dispelled, on his sitting down to breakfast along with the Jew, who told him, in a tone and manner which increased his alarm, that he was to be taken to the residence of Bill Sikes that night."
"“一直——一直——留在那儿吗，先生？”奥利弗急切地问道。","“To—to—stop there, sir?” asked Oliver, anxiously."
"“不，不，亲爱的。不是一直留在那儿。”犹太佬回答，“我们怎么舍得失去你呢。别担心，小奥利弗，你还是要回到我们这儿的。哈哈哈！我们不会那么残忍，把你送走的，亲爱的。噢，不会，不会的！”","“No, no, my dear.Not to stop there,” replied the Jew.“We shouldn’t like to lose you.Don’t be afraid, Oliver, you shall come back to us again.Ha! ha! ha!We won’t be so cruel as to send you away, my dear.Oh no, no!”"
"这会儿，老头儿正弯腰在火上烤着一块面包，他一边这样跟奥利弗开着玩笑，一边向四下里张望，然后咯咯地笑起来，似乎是想告诉奥利弗他心里很清楚，只要可以，奥利弗巴不得溜掉呢。","The old man, who was stooping over the fire toasting a piece of bread, looked round as he bantered Oliver thus; and chuckled as if to show that he knew he would still be very glad to get away if he could."
"“我觉得，”犹太佬死死盯着奥利弗，说道，“你一定很想知道为什么要把你送到比尔那儿吧——嗯，亲爱的？”","“I suppose,” said the Jew, fixing his eyes on Oliver, “you want to know what you’re going to Bill’s for—eh, my dear?”"
"奥利弗见这个老贼对自己的心思很清楚，不禁红了脸。但是大胆地说，是的，他确实很想知道。","Oliver coloured, involuntarily, to find that the old thief had been reading his thoughts; but boldly said, Yes, he did want to know."
"“那，你觉得是为什么呢？”费金避开问题反问他。","“Why, do you think?” inquired Fagin, parrying the question."
"“我确实不知道，先生。”奥利弗回答道。","“Indeed I don’t know, sir,” replied Oliver."
"“呸！”犹太佬仔细打量着男孩的面孔说道，然后失望地转过身去，“那就等比尔告诉你吧。”","“Bah!” said the Jew, turning away with a disappointed countenance from a close perusal of the boy’s face.“Wait till Bill tells you, then.”"
"奥利弗对这个问题并没有表现出很大的好奇心，犹太佬对此十分恼火。不过事实是这样的，尽管奥利弗对此感到十分焦急，但他已经被费金神情中流露出的狡诈以及自己的种种猜测弄得困惑不堪了，也顾不上继续询问了。他也没有别的机会可以问了。因为费金一直到天黑准备出门前，都始终板着脸，一言不发。","The Jew seemed much vexed by Oliver’s not expressing any greater curiosity on the subject; but the truth is, that, although Oliver felt very anxious, he was too much confused by the earnest cunning of Fagin’s looks, and his own speculations, to make any further inquiries just then.He had no other opportunity: for the Jew remained very surly and silent till night: when he prepared to go abroad."
"“你可以点上蜡烛了，”说着，犹太佬把一根蜡烛放在桌子上，“这里有几本书，你可以读读，等着他们来接你。晚安！”","“You may burn a candle,” said the Jew, putting one upon the table.“And here’s a book for you to read, till they come to fetch you.Good-night!”"
"“晚安！”奥利弗轻声回答。","“Good-night!” replied Oliver, softly."
"犹太佬走到门口，边走边回头打量着这个孩子。突然他停步了，叫了奥利弗一声。","The Jew walked to the door: looking over his shoulder at the boy as he went.Suddenly stopping, he called him by his name."
"奥利弗抬起头，看到犹太佬正指着蜡烛，让他点上。奥利弗照办了，把烛台放在桌子上。他看见犹太佬依旧站在门口的黑暗里盯着自己，眉头紧锁。","Oliver looked up; the Jew, pointing to the candle, motioned him to light it.He did so; and, as he placed the candlestick upon the table, saw that the Jew was gazing fixedly at him, with lowering and contracted brows, from the dark end of the room."
"“当心点，奥利弗！当心点！”老头说着，在他面前晃晃右手，像是在发出警告，“他是一个粗暴的人，一旦情绪激动起来，连命都不要。不管发生什么事，什么也别说。他让你做什么你就做什么。当心点！”着重强调完最后一句话，费金绷紧的面部表情渐渐变为一种令人害怕的笑容，然后他冲奥利弗点点头，离开了房间。","“Take heed, Oliver! take heed!” said the old man, shaking his right hand before him in a warning manner.“He’s a rough man, and thinks nothing of blood when his own is up.Whatever falls out, say nothing; and do what he bids you.Mind!”Placing a strong emphasis on the last word, he suffered his features gradually to resolve themselves into a ghastly grin, and, nodding his head, left the room."
"老头走后，奥利弗用手撑着脑袋，心里忐忑不安，他仔细地推敲着刚刚听到的话。对于犹太佬的警告，他想得越多，越不明白他的真实目的和意图。","Oliver leaned his head upon his hand when the old man disappeared, and pondered, with a trembling heart, on the words he had just heard.The more he thought of the Jew’s admonition, the more he was at a loss to divine its real purpose and meaning."
"他想不到把自己派去赛克斯那儿会有什么样的坏目的，而这个目的又是他自己跟费金呆在一起无法实现的。他想了好久，最后得出结论，自己是被选去给那个强盗做仆人的，直到物色到更加适合的小孩为止。奥利弗早已习惯逆来顺受，在这里他也已经遭尽了罪，因此面对充满变化的未来，他早就已经哭不出来了。他又沉思了几分钟，然后重重叹了口气，剪掉烛花，拿起犹太佬留给他的书读了起来。","He could think of no bad object to be attained by sending him to Sikes, which would not be equally well answered by his remaining with Fagin; and after meditating for a long time, concluded that he had been selected to perform some ordinary menial offices for the housebreaker, until anot her boy, better suited for his purpose could be engaged.He was too well accustomed to suffering, and had suffered too much where he was, to bewail the prospect of change very severely.He remained lost in thought for some minutes; and then, with a heavy sigh, snuffed the candle, and, taking up the book which the Jew had left with him, began to read."
"他翻了几页书。刚开始的时候，他漫不经心，但是突然眼前一亮，被一段话吸引住了。不久，他就完全沉浸在这本书里了。这本书讲述的是一些有名的犯人的生平事迹和被审判的故事。书页已经脏了，处处留有指印。在书中，他读到了使人血液发凉的罪行；读到了那些发生在偏僻路旁的秘密谋杀；读到了被神不知鬼不觉埋进深坑或者丢进井里的尸体，尽管坑和井都很深，但还是无法把尸体藏得很好，最终多年之后，还是得被发现，使得凶手们为此发狂，在惊恐中只好坦白了他们的罪行，叫喊着要求被送上绞刑台以结束自己的痛苦。在书中，他读到了有人夜间好端端地躺在床上，被自己的某种邪念引诱和唆使（他们自己是这么说的），干出些可怕的血腥事件，让人一想到就心惊胆战，四肢哆嗦。这些恐怖的描述是如此逼真、生动，那一页页泛黄的书页如同被血染红了，书页上的文字回荡在他的耳边，就像死者的灵魂正在他耳边低语。","He turned over the leaves.Carelessly at first; but, lighting on a passage which attracted his attention, he soon became intent upon the volume.It was a history of the lives and trials of great criminals; and the pages were soiled and thumbed with use.Here, he read of dreadful crimes that made the blood run cold; of secret murders that had been committed by the lonely wayside; of bodies hidden from the eye of man in deep pits and wells:which would not keep them down, deep as they were, but had yielded them up at last, after many years, and so maddened the murderers with the sight, that in their horror they had confessed their guilt, and yelled for the gibbet to end their agony.Here, too, he read of men who, lying in their beds at dead of night, had been tempted (so they said) and led on, by their own bad thoughts, to such dreadful bloodshed as it made the flesh creep, and the limbs quail, to think of.The terrible descriptions were so real and vivid, that the sallow pages seemed to turn red with gore; and the words upon them, to be sounded in his ears, as if they were whispered, in hollow murmurs, by the spirits of the dead."
"突如其来的恐惧使奥利弗把书合上，扔到一边。然后，他双膝跪下，祈求上帝让他不要犯这种罪，就算让他立马死去，也不要让他去干这些令人震惊的罪行。他渐渐恢复了平静，继续断断续续地低声恳求上帝，将自己从目前的危险中解救出来。如果有一种援助是专为从来没有体会过朋友或亲人之爱的苦命孤儿提供的，那么这种援助也是时候来了，因为他现在正孤独无助地处于邪恶与罪孽的包围之中。","In a paroxysm of fear, the boy closed the book, and thrust it from him.Then, falling upon his knees, he prayed Heaven to spare him from such deeds; and rather to will that he should die at once, than be reserved for crimes, so fearful and appalling.By degrees, he grew more calm, and besought, in a low and broken voice, that he might be rescued from his present dangers; and that if any aid were to be raised up for a poor outcast boy who had never known the love of friends or kindred, it might come to him now, when, desolate and deserted, he stood alone in the midst of wickedness and guilt."
"他做完祷告后，双手依旧捂着脸。就在这个时候，一阵沙沙声唤醒了他。","He had concluded his prayer, but still remained with his head buried in his hands, when a rustling noise aroused him."
"“是什么！”他大叫着跳了起来，看到门边站着一个人影。“是谁在那儿？”","“What’s that!” he cried, starting up, and catching sight of a figure standing by the door.“Who’s there?”"
"“是我。就我自己。”一个颤抖的声音传了过来。","“Me.Only me,” replied a tremulous voice."
"奥利弗把蜡烛举过了头顶，朝门口望去。原来是南希姑娘。","Oliver raised the candle above his head: and looked towards the door.It was Nancy."
"“快把蜡烛放下来，”南希边说边把头转向一侧，“这光太晃眼了。”","“Put down the light,” said the girl, turning away her head.“It hurts my eyes.”"
"奥利弗见她面色苍白，就轻声询问她是不是生病了。姑娘一屁股坐到了椅子上，背对着奥利弗，使劲搓着双手，没有回答。","Oliver saw that she was very pale, and gently inquired if she were ill.The girl threw herself into a chair, with her back towards him: and wrung her hands; but made no reply."
"“上帝啊，宽恕我吧！”没多久，她叫了起来，“我还真没想到是这么一回事。”","“God forgive me!” she cried after a while, “I never thought of this.”"
"“出什么事了吗？”奥利弗问。“有什么我能帮忙的吗？如果我可以的话，一定会帮你的。一定会的。”","“Has anything happened?” asked Oliver.“Can I help you?I will if I can.I will, indeed.”"
"她前后摇晃着椅子，卡住了喉咙，发出咕噜声，快喘不过气了。","She rocked herself to and fro; caught her throat; and, uttering a gurgling sound, gasped for breath."
"“南希！”奥利弗大叫起来，“你怎么了？”","“Nancy!” cried Oliver, “What is it?”"
"姑娘用手拍打着她的膝盖，两脚使劲跺着地。突然她停住了，裹了裹围巾，瑟瑟发抖起来。","The girl beat her hands upon her knees, and her feet upon the ground; and, suddenly stopping, drew her shawl close round her: and shivered with cold."
"奥利弗将炉火弄大了一些。南希将椅子往炉火边移了移，坐了下来，好久都没有说话。最后她终于抬起头，向四周看了看。","Oliver stirred the fire.Drawing her chair close to it, she sat there, for a little time, without speaking; but at length she raised her head, and looked round."
"“有时候，我真不知道这是怎么了，”南希一边假装整理衣服一边说道，“我觉得可能是因为那个又潮又脏的屋子吧。喂，诺利，我亲爱的，你准备好了吗？”","“I don’t know what comes over me sometimes,” said she, affecting to busy herself in arranging her dress; “it’s this damp dirty room, I think.Now, Nolly, dear, are you ready?”"
"“我跟你一起走吗？”奥利弗问道。","“Am I to go with you?” asked Oliver."
"“对。我刚从比尔那儿过来，”姑娘回答，“咱们一起过去吧。”","“Yes.I have come from Bill,” replied the girl.“You are to go with me.”"
"“去干什么啊？”奥利弗边后退边问。","“What for?” asked Oliver, recoiling."
"“去干什么？”姑娘重复着他的问题，抬起头来，目光刚一触到男孩的脸，又立马转到一边去了。“噢！反正不是什么坏事。”","“What for?” echoed the girl, raising her eyes, and averting them again, the moment they encountered the boy’s face.“Oh!For no harm.”"
"“我可不信。”奥利弗死死盯着南希，说道。","“I don’t believe it,” said Oliver: who had watched her closely."
"“随便你怎么想吧。”姑娘假装笑着，答道，“当然了，也不是什么好事。”","“Have it your own way,” rejoined the girl, affecting to laugh.“For no good, then.”"
"奥利弗能够感觉得到，自己或多或少可以博得这位姑娘的喜爱。他又立刻想到，自己现在孤立无援，或许可以在她这儿寻得同情。然后，另一个念头又在他脑海中闪现：现在刚刚十一点，大街上人还很多，总会有一些人可能会相信他讲的事情。想到这些，他走上前，带着一丝慌张，说他已经准备好了。","Oliver could see that he had some power over the girl’s better feelings, and, for an instant, thought of appealing to her compassion for his helpless state.But, then, the thought darted across his mind that it was barely eleven o’clock; and that many people were still in the streets: of whom surely some might be found to give credence to his tale.As the reflection occured to him, he stepped forward: and said, somewhat hastily, that he was ready."
"无论是他短暂的考虑，还是这考虑的意图，都没能瞒过他的这个伙伴。他说话的时候，南希死死地盯着他。她再次用她充满智慧的眼神看着他，明确地表示她已经猜到了他打的小算盘。","Neither his brief consideration, nor its purport, was lost on his companion.She eyed him narrowly, while he spoke; and cast upon him a look of intelligence which sufficiently showed that she guessed what had been passing in his thoughts."
"“嘘！”姑娘说着，弯下腰来，一边小心谨慎地打量着四周一边指着门。“你救不了你自己。我已经尽力想要帮你了，不过没有用。他们已经把你看得死死的了。就算是你想要逃走，现在也不是时候。”","“Hush!” said the girl, stooping over him, and pointing to the door as she looked cautiously round.“You can’t help yourself.I have tried hard for you, but all to no purpose.You are hedged round and round.If ever you are to get loose from here, this is not the time.”"
"她表情中流露出的热切使奥利弗震惊。他吃惊地抬起头，看着她的脸。看上去，她像是说了实话。她面色苍白，情绪激动，浑身打战，可见她是很认真的。","Struck by the energy of her manner, Oliver looked up in her face with great surprise.She seemed to speak the truth; her countenance was white and agitated; and she trembled with very earnestness."
"“我已经救过你一次了，使你免了一顿毒打。我以后还是会那么做的。而且我现在就是在那么做。”姑娘依旧大声说道，“如果来接你的不是我，而是别人，他们一定会比我凶得多。我曾经保证过，说你会乖乖听话。如果你不这样，只会害了你自己和我，说不定还会要了我的命。你看看这儿！我已经为你吃了这苦头了。上帝可以作证，这是真的。”","“I have saved you from being ill-used once, and I will again, and I do now,” continued the girl aloud; “for those who would have fetched you, if I had not, would have been far more rough than me.I have promised for your being quiet and silent; if you are not, you will only do harm to yourself and me too, and perhaps be my death.See here!I have borne all this for you already, as true as God sees me show it.”"
"她迅速地指了指自己脖子上和手臂上的一些青紫伤痕，紧接着又快速说：“你得记住这一点！现在不要让我再为你吃更多苦头了。如果我能够帮你，我一定会帮的。但是我现在没有这个能力。他们并不打算伤害你。他们逼着你做什么，那也不是你的错．听着！从你嘴里说出的每一句话都如同打在我身上一样。把手给我。快！给我你的手！”","She pointed, hastily, to some livid bruises on her neck and arms; and continued, with great rapidity: “Remember this!And don’t let me suffer more for you, just now.If I could help you, I would; but I have not the power.They don’t mean to harm you; whatever they make you do, is no fault of yours.Hush!Every word from you is a blow for me.Give me your hand.Make haste!Your hand!”"
"奥利弗本能地把手伸了过去。南希抓住奥利弗的手，吹灭了蜡烛，拉着他走下楼去。一个隐藏在黑暗中的人迅速地把门打开，等他们走出去后，门又迅速关上了。一辆双轮马车已经等在门口了。南希热切地拉着奥立弗登上马车，这种热切在刚才她与奥利弗谈话时就一直伴随着她了。然后她拉下了窗帘。车夫不等吩咐，立刻抽了马一鞭，马车全速向前开走了。","She caught the hand which Oliver instinctively placed in hers, and, blowing out the light, drew him after her up the stairs.The door was opened, quickly, by some one shrouded in the darkness, and was as quickly closed, when they had passed out.A hackney-cabriolet was in waiting; with the same vehemence which she had exhibited in addressing Oliver, the girl pulled him in with her, and drew the curtains close.The driver wanted no directions, but lashed his horse into full speed, without the delay of an instant."
"南希姑娘依旧紧紧握着奥利弗的手，继续把那些已经说过的警告和保证统统送进他的耳朵里。这一切来得是如此迅速仓促，他还没来得及想一想自己在哪儿，或者说他是怎么来的，马车已经在犹太佬前两天晚上拜访过的那所房子前面停下了。","The girl still held Oliver fast by the hand, and continued to pour into his ear, the warnings and assurances she had already imparted.All was so quick and hurried, that he had scarcely time to recollect where he was, or how he came there, when the carriage stopped at the house to which the Jew’s steps had been directed on the previous evening."
"在短短的一瞬间，奥利弗匆匆看了一眼空旷的街道，喊救命的声音已经在他的嘴边了。但是，南希姑娘的声音在他耳边响起。那些声音痛苦地恳求他千万不要忘记她的话。奥利弗最终也没有勇气喊出救命。在犹豫中，他错过了机会。这会儿功夫，他已经走进了屋子里，门也关上了。","For one brief moment, Oliver cast a hurried glance along the empty street, and a cry for help hung upon his lips.But the girl’s voice was in his ear, beseeching him in such tones of agony to remember her, that he had not the heart to utter it.While he hesitated, the opportunity was gone; he was already in the house, and the door was shut."
"“这边走。”南希说着，第一次松开了手，“比尔！”","“This way,” said the girl, releasing her hold for the first time.“Bill!”"
"“你好啊！”赛克斯出现在楼梯上面，回答道。他的手里拿着一支蜡烛。“噢！来的正是时候。快上来吧！”","“Hallo!” replied Sikes: appearing at the head of the stairs, with a candle.“Oh!That’s the time of day.Come on!”"
"对于赛克斯这种性情的人来说，这已经算是感情极强的称赞了，也算是很难得的欢迎了。南希似乎对此很开心，亲切地跟他打招呼。","This was a very strong expression of approbation, an uncommonly hearty welcome, from a person of Mr. Sikes’ temperament.Nancy, appearing much gratified thereby, saluted him cordially."
"“牛眼儿跟着汤姆一块回去了。”赛克斯一边用蜡烛给他们俩照着上楼梯的路，一边说道，“要是他在这儿的话，会碍事的。”","“Bull’s-eye’s gone home with Tom,” observed Sikes, as he lighted them up.“He’d have been in the way.”"
"“对啊。”南希回答。","“That’s right,” rejoined Nancy."
"“你把这孩子给领来了。”走进屋子，关上门后，赛克斯说道。","“So you’ve  got the kid,” said Sikes when they had all reached the room: closing the door as he spoke."
"“是啊，带来了。”南希回答。","“Yes, here he is,” replied Nancy."
"“他来的时候安静吗？”赛克斯问。","“Did he come quiet?”inquired Sikes."
"“安静得就像一只小羊羔似的。”曼西回答。","“Like a lamb,” rejoined Nancy."
"“我很高兴你能这么说。”赛克斯冷酷地打量着奥利弗，说道，“看在他这身细皮嫩肉的份上，要不然有他好受的。过来，小家伙，让我来给你先上上课。我觉得还是现在就给你上上课比较好。”","“I’m glad to hear it,” said Sikes, looking grimly at Oliver; “for the sake of his young carcase: as would otherways have suffered for it.Come here, young ’un; and let me read you a lectur’, which is as well got over at once.”"
"赛克斯就这样亲切地称呼他的新学生。然后他扯下奥利弗的帽子，把它丢在角落里。他自己坐在桌子旁边，抓住奥利弗的肩膀，让他站在自己面前。","Thus addressing his new pupil, Mr. Sikes pulled off Oliver’s cap and threw it into a corner; and then, taking him by the shoulder, sat himself down by the table, and stood the boy in front of him."
"“喏，首先，你知道这是什么吗？”赛克斯拿起桌子上的一支手枪问道。","“Now, first: do you know wot this is?” inquired Sikes, taking up a pocket-pistol which lay on the table."
"奥利弗给出了正确的答案。","Oliver replied in the affirmative."
"“很好，来，看这儿。”赛克斯继续说，“这是火药。这是子弹。这是塞填药塞时要用到的一小块旧毡帽。”","“Well, then, look here,” continued Sikes.“This is powder; that’ere’s a bullet; and this is a little bit of a old hat for waddin’.”"
"奥利弗低声说，他知道这每一部分分别是干什么的。赛克斯一步步地装好手枪，动作从容且熟练。","Oliver murmured his comprehension of the different bodies referred to; and Mr. Sikes proceeded to load the pistol, with great nicety and deliberation."
"“现在它已经装上弹药了。”赛克斯装好后说道。","“Now it’s loaded,” said Mr. Sikes, when he had finished."
"“嗯，先生，我看到了。”奥利弗回答。","“Yes, I see it is, sir,” replied Oliver."
"“那个，”这位强盗一把抓住奥利弗的手腕，把枪口对在了他的太阳穴上。孩子瞬间吓得跳了起来。“你跟着我出门的时候，要是敢说一个字，这子弹就会进入你的脑袋中，连个招呼也不会打，当然了，除非是我先让你说的。所以，你要是准备随便开口说话，最好提前把祷告做了。”","“Well,” said the robber, grasping Oliver’s wrist, and putting the barrel so close to his temple that they touched; at which moment the boy could not repress a start; “if you speak a word when you’re out o’doors with me, except when I speak to you, that loading will be in your head without notice.So, if you do make up your mind to speak without leave, say your prayers first.”"
"为了加强这些话的作用，赛克斯还狠狠地瞪了这位受警告的孩子一眼，然后又继续说道：","Having bestowed a scowl upon the object of this warning, to increase its effect, Mr. Sikes continued."
"“据我所知，你要是真的死了，根本就不会有人询问起你的情况。因此，要不是为了你好，我根本就不必费这么多口舌向你解释这么多。你听明白了吗？”","“As near as I know, there isn’t anybody as would be asking very partickler arter you, if you was disposed of; so I needn’t take this devil-and-all of trouble to explain matters to you, if it warn’t for your own good.D’ye hear me?”"
"“说得明白些吧，”南希用强调的语气说道，同时又微微向奥利弗皱了皱眉头，似乎是想提醒他要多多留意她的话，“也就是说，要是他在干这个活的时候惹你生气了，你就会一枪崩了他，让他以后再也不能胡说八道了。为了这事，即使你可能会有被处绞刑的危险，你也不在乎。就像你为了做这生意不惜要做其他很多事情一样，而且你每个月都会做这种事情。”","“The short and the long of what you mean,” said Nancy: speaking very emphatically, and slightly frowning at Oliver as if to bespeak his serious attention to her words:“is, that if you’re crossed by him in this job you have on hand, you’ll prevent his ever telling tales afterwards, by shooting him through the head, and will take your chance of swinging for it, as you do for a great many other things in the way of business, every month of your life.”"
"“就是这样！”赛克斯赞同地说，“女人家总是能够把事情用简单的语言说明白。——除非是发神经的时候，她们讲起话来就啰嗦个没完了。现在既然他已经完全明白了，我们吃点饭吧，动身之前稍稍打个盹儿。”","“That’s it!” observed Mr. Sikes, approvingly; “women can always put things in fewest words.—Except when it’s blowing up; and then they lengthens it out.And now that he’s thoroughly up to it, let’s have some supper, and get a snooze before starting.”"
"按照这一吩咐，南希迅速地铺好了桌布。她出去了一会儿，再回来的时候，带来了一罐黑啤酒和一盘羊头肉。这给了赛克斯先生机会，说了些令人开心的俏皮话。他发现“羊头肉”这个词碰巧是帮派里的一种说法，也是干他们这一行必不可少的一种巧妙的工具。的确，或许是因为马上就可以大干一场了吧，这位值得尊敬的先生精神格外饱满，一直开着玩笑。为证明上述情况是正确的，有一点必须得提，那就是他风趣地把所有的啤酒一口气全都喝了下去。而且粗略估计一下，他在整个吃饭过程中，骂人的次数竟然没有超过八十次。","In pursuance of this request, Nancy quickly laid the cloth; disappearing for a few minutes, she presently returned with a pot of porter and a dish of sheep’s heads: which gave occasion to several pleasant witticisms on the part of Mr. Sikes, founded upon the singular coincidence of “jemmies” being a can name, common to them, and also to an ingenious implement much used in his profession.Indeed, the worthy gentleman, stimulated perhaps by the immediate prospect of being on active service, was in great spirits and good humour; in proof whereof, it may be here remarked, that he humourously drank all the beer at a draught, and did not utter, on a rough calculation, more than four-score oaths during the whole progress of the meal."
"吃完晚饭——完全可以想象，奥利弗对晚饭毫无胃口——赛克斯又喝了几杯兑了水的烈酒，然后把自己抛到了床上，嘱咐南希五点整喊醒他，还说了些要是做不到就不得好死之类的诅咒。奥利弗接到了来自同一位权威人士的命令。他穿着衣服直接躺在了地板的垫子上。南希给炉子添了火，在炉子前面坐了下来，准备在指定的时间叫醒他们。","Supper being ended—it may be easily conceived that Oliver had no great appetite for it—Mr. Sikes disposed of a couple of glasses of spirits and water, and threw himself on the bed; ordering Nancy, with many imprecations in case of failure, to call him at five precisely.Oliver stretched himself in his clothes, by command of the same authority, on a mattress upon the floor; and the girl, mending the fire, sat before it, in readiness to rouse them at the appointed time."
"奥利弗躺在那儿辗转反侧，难以入眠。他想南希不可能不抓住这个机会，给自己下一步的建议。但是南希姑娘一动不动地坐在火炉前，想着心事，不时剪一剪烛花。奥利弗又期待又焦虑，疲惫不堪，最后，他不知不觉地睡着了。","For a long time Oliver lay awake, thinking it not impossible that Nancy might seek that opportunity of whispering some further advice; but the girl sat brooding over the fire, without moving, save now and then to trim the light.Weary with watching and anxiety, he at length fell asleep."
"当他醒来的时候，桌子上已经摆好了茶具。赛克斯正在将各种各样的东西塞进一件大衣的口袋里，大衣挂在椅背上。南希姑娘正忙着准备早餐。天还没有完全亮，屋子里依旧点着蜡烛，外面漆黑一片。大雨正敲打着窗户，天空中乌云密布，格外阴沉。","When he awoke, the table was covered with tea-things, and Sikes was thrusting various articles into the pockets of his great-coat, which hung over the back of a chair.Nancy was busily engaged in preparing breakfast. It was not yet daylight; for the candle was still burning, and it was quite dark outside.A sharp rain, too, was beating against the window-panes; and the sky looked black and cloudy."
"“喂！”赛克斯看到奥利弗起来了，咆哮道，“已经五点半了！快点，要不然你就吃不上早饭了，本来就已经起得很晚了。”","“Now, then!” growled Sikes, as Oliver started up; “half-past five!Look sharp, or you’ll get no breakfast; for it’s late as it is.”"
"奥利弗一会儿就洗漱完毕了。他快速吃了点早餐，当赛克斯板着脸问他的时候，他回答说已经准备好了。","Oliver was not long in making his toilet; having taken some breakfast, he replied to a surly inquiry from Sikes, by saying that he was quite ready."
"南希尽量避免正眼看奥利弗。她扔给奥利弗一块手绢，叫他系在脖子上。赛克斯给了他一件粗糙的披肩，叫他披在肩膀上，扣上扣子。打扮好了后，他朝那个强盗伸过手去。强盗停了一下，威吓似的向奥利弗显示，自己已经把手枪放在大衣的侧口袋里。然后他紧紧攥住奥利弗的手，跟南希道别，便领着他出发了。","Nancy, scarcely looking at the boy, threw him a handkerchief to tie round his throat; Sikes gave him a large rough cape to button over his shoulders.Thus attired, he gave his hand to the robber, who, merely pausing to show him with a menacing gesture that he had that same pistol in a side-pocket of his great-coat, clasped it firmly in his, and, exchanging a farewell with Nancy, led him away."
"当他们走到门口的时候，奥利弗突然回头，希望能够碰上南希姑娘的目光。但是她已经回到炉火旁边的老位置，一动不动地坐在那里了。","Oliver turned, for an instant, when they reached the door, in the hope of meeting a look from the girl.But she had resumed her old seat in front of the fire, and sat, perfectly motionless before it."
"第二十一章","CHAPTER XXI"
"远行","The Expedition"
"早上他们走到街上的时候，天气让人沮丧：劲风急雨，阴云密布，似乎在酝酿一场暴雨。昨晚下了一夜的雨，地面上积起了很多大水洼，雨水漫过了路边的沟渠。天空中些许微光闪动，预示新一天的到来。这非但没有缓解景色的压抑，反倒使其更加阴晦：这阴郁的微光唯一的作用就是将街灯的光线衬得苍白，却没有在湿漉漉的马厩顶层或沉闷的街道上洒落一点更为温暖或明亮的色调。镇上的街区里面似乎还没有人活动的迹象，所有房子的窗户都紧紧关着，而他们穿过的街道也是静悄悄、空荡荡的。　","It was a cheerless morning when they got into the street; blowing and raining hard; and the clouds looking dull and stormy.The night had been very wet: large pools of water had collected in the road: and the kennels were overflowing.There was a faint glimmering of the coming day in the sky; but it rather aggravated than relieved the gloom of the scene: the sombre light only serving to pale that which the street lamps afforded, without shedding any warmer or brighter tints upon the wet house-tops, and dreary streets.There appeared to be nobody stirring in that quarter of the town; the windows of the houses were all closely shut; and the streets through which they passed, were noiseless and empty."
"他们转进贝丝勒尔草地大道的时候，天色已经相当亮了。很多路灯已经熄灭，几辆乡村马车正在缓慢而艰难地朝伦敦方向驶去，时不时地有沾满污泥的驿站马车嗒嗒地疾驰而过：驾车人在超过那笨头笨脑的马车车夫时，会抽他一鞭子以示警告，因为车夫驾车岔了道，害他不能准时到站，已经比平常晚了二十五秒。酒店里面点着煤气灯，已经开门做生意了。逐渐地，其他店铺也开了，他们三三两两地遇见了几个人。接着，零零星星的几群工人开始上工了，而后顶着鱼篮的男男女女，装满蔬菜的驴车，满载着活家畜或已屠宰好的整肉的轻便马车，提着木桶的牛奶工，络绎不绝的人群带着各种各样的供给长途跋涉地走向镇东郊区。他们快到伦敦时，喧嚣声愈来愈大，街上渐渐车水马龙；当他们艰难穿过肖狄奇区和伦敦肉市场中间的几条街道时，整个伦敦城已是一片人声鼎沸、熙熙攘攘的景象。天已大亮，直到夜幕又一次降临才会再暗下去，而半数伦敦人也开始了他们繁忙的早晨。","By the time they had turned into the Bethnal Green Road, the day had fairly begun to break.Many of the lamps were already extinguished; a few country waggons were slowly toiling on, towards London; now and then, a stage-coach, covered with mud, rattled briskly by: the driver bestowing, as he passed, and admonitory lash upon the heavy waggoner who, by keeping on the wrong side of the road, had endangered his arriving at the office, a quarter of a minute after his time.The public-houses, with gas-lights burning inside, were already open.By degrees, other shops began to be unclosed, and a few scattered people were met with.Then, came straggling groups of labourers going to their work; then, men and women with fish-baskets on their heads; donkey-carts laden with vegetables; chaise-carts filled with live-stock or whole carcasses of meat; milk-women with pails; an unbroken concourse of people, trudging out with various supplies to the eastern suburbs of the town.As they approached the City, the noise and traffic gradually increased; when they threaded the streets between Shoreditch and Smithfield, it had swelled into a roar of sound and bustle.It was as light as it was likely to be, till night came on again, and the busy morning of half the London population had begun."
"经过太阳街、克朗街，穿过芬斯伯雷广场，赛克斯先生沿着契士韦尔路急匆匆地走进望楼街，穿过长巷，到了伦敦肉市场。那里正传出一阵喧闹声，奥利弗·特威斯特吃了一惊。","Turning down Sun Street and Crown Street, and crossing Finsbury square, Mr. Sikes struck, by way of Chiswell Street, into Barbican: thence into Long Lane, and so into Smithfield; from which latter place arose a tumult of discordant sounds that filled Oliver Twist with amazement."
"这天早上有早集。地面上覆盖着的污秽烂泥，几乎能没过脚踝；一股浓浓的蒸汽，从那臭气熏天的牛身上不断散发出来，和似乎总是缭绕在烟筒顶部的烟雾混杂在一起，沉郁郁地悬聚在空中。阔地中心所有的围栏，以及空地中塞得下的所有临时围栏里，都关满了绵羊；排水沟旁边的柱子上，拴着长长的三四排牲畜和公牛。农夫、屠户、牲口贩、街头小贩、男孩、小偷、懒汉，以及社会底层形形色色的流氓无赖乱七八糟地混杂在一起；牲口贩的口哨声、狗的吠叫声、公牛的咆哮和踢蹄声、羊咩咩的叫声、猪发出的呼呼噜噜、哼哼唧唧的声音、小贩的吆喝声，各种叫喊声、咒骂声、争吵声，从四面八方传来。各个酒馆里铃声嘈杂、人声喧闹；人们拥挤着，互相摧搡、追逐，里头还夹杂着斗殴、叫好和叫喊声；市场各个角落里弥漫着可怕而不和谐的暗光；一些不洗澡、不刮脸、肮脏不堪的身影不停地在人群中跑进跑出；这一切构成了一幅令人瞠目结舌、晕头转向的场景，使整个局面相当混乱。","It was market-morning.The ground was covered, nearly ankle-deep, with filth and mire; a thick steam, perpetually rising from the reeking bodies of the cattle, and mingling with the fog, which seemed to rest upon the chimney-tops, hung heavily above.All the pens in the centre of the large area, and as many temporary pens as could be crowded into the vacant space, were filled with sheep; tied up to posts by the gutter side were long lines of beasts and oxen, three or four deep.Countrymen, butchers, drovers, hawkers, boys, thieves, idlers, and vagabonds of every low grade, were mingled together in a mass; the whistling of drovers, the barking dogs, the bellowing and plunging of the oxen, the bleating of sheep, the grunting and squeaking of pigs, the cries of hawkers, the shouts, oaths, and quarrelling on all sides;the ringing of bells and roar of voices, that issued from every public-house; the crowding, pushing, driving, beating, whooping and yelling; the hideous and discordant dim that resounded from every corner of the market; and the unwashed, unshaven, squalid, and dirty figures constantly running to and fro, and bursting in and out of the throng; rendered it a stunning and bewildering scene, which quite confounded the senses."
"赛克斯先生拉着身后的奥利弗，用胳膊从最拥挤的人群中捅开一条路。他几乎完全不理会身边那众多的场景和声音，而奥利弗却对那些感到十分惊奇。有这么两三次，他朝路过的朋友点头，拒绝了同样多次数要他来点清晨小酒的邀请；他坚定不移地往前走，直到他们走出这片混乱之地，穿过袜子巷，朝着霍尔本山走去。","Mr. Sikes, dragging Oliver after him, elbowed his way through the thickest of the crowd, and bestowed very little attention on the numerous sights and sounds, which so astonished the boy.He nodded, twice or thrice, to a passing friend; and, resisting as many invitations to take a morning dram, pressed steadily onward, until they were clear of the turmoil, and had made their way through Hosier Lane into Holborn."
"“嘿，年轻人！”赛克斯先生抬头看向圣安德鲁教堂的钟，说道，“快七点了！你一定得迈开大步走。快点儿，别再落在后面了，懒家伙！”","“Now, young ’un!” said Sikes, looking up at the clock of St. Andrew’s Church, “hard upon seven!You must step out.Come, don’t lag behind already, Lazy-legs!”"
"赛克斯先生一边说一边猛拉了一把小家伙的手腕。奥利弗加快了步伐，变成介于快走和奔跑之间的小跑，使出全力来跟上这个大步流星的强盗。","Mr. Sikes accompanied this speech with a jerk at his little companion’s wrist; Oliver, quickening his pace into a kind of trot between a fast walk and a run, kept up with the rapid strides of the house-breaker as well as he could."
"他们一直以这个速度赶路，直到他们经过了海德公园拐角，朝肯辛顿走去；这时赛克斯先生放慢了步伐，一直到背后不远处那辆空着的马车赶上来。赛克斯看到马车上写着“豪恩斯洛”的字样，就以他能想到的最礼貌的方式问车夫，可否把他们带到艾尔沃斯。","They held their course at this rate, until they had passed Hyde Park corner, and were on their way to Kensington: when Sikes relaxed his pace, until an empty cart which was at some little distance behind, came up.Seeing “Hounslow” written on it, he asked the driver with as much civility as he could assume, if he would give them a lift as far as Isleworth."
"“跳上来吧。”车夫说，“这是您儿子吗？”","“Jump up,” said the man.“Is that your boy?”"
"“是啊，是我儿子。”赛克斯回答说。他死盯着奥利弗，一只手好似心不在焉地伸进装有手枪的口袋里。","“Yes; he’s my boy,” replied Sikes, looking hard at Oliver, and putting his hand abstractedly into the pocket where the pistol was."
"“你父亲走得太快,你都跟不上了，是不是，小伙子？”车夫看到奥利弗上气不接下气，就这样询问道。","“Your father walks rather too quick for you, don’t he, my man?” inquired the driver: seeing that Oliver was out of breath."
"“没有的事儿。”赛克斯插嘴说，“他已经习惯了。","“Not a bit of it,” replied Sikes, interposing.“He’s used to it."
"来，内德，抓着我的手。上去！”","Here, take hold of my hand, Ned.In with you!”"
"他一边这么对奥利弗说，一边帮他上了马车。车夫指着一摞麻袋，让他去那里躺下休息。","Thus addressing Oliver, he helped him into the cart; and the driver, pointing to a heap of sacks, told him to lie down there, and rest himself."
"随着他们经过不同的路标，奥利弗越来越疑惑，不知道他身边这个人打算把他带到哪里去。他们已经一路经过了肯辛顿、哈默史密斯、契息克、植物园桥和布伦特福德，却依旧平稳前行，似乎旅途刚刚开始。最后，他们到了一家叫做“马车与马”的酒馆；在那家酒馆不远处，另有一条大路通向远方。马车就在这里停了下来。","As they passed the different mile-stones, Oliver wondered, more and more, where his companion meant to take him.Kensington, Hammersmith, Chiswick, Kew Bridge, Brentford, were all passed; and yet they went on as steadily as if they had only just begun their journey.At length, they came to a public-house called the Coach and Horses; a little way beyond which, another road appeared to run off.And here, the cart stopped."
"赛克斯径直跳下了马车，这期间一直抓着奥利弗的手不放。然后他双手一抬，直接把奥利弗从马车上移到了地上。他恶狠狠地看了奥利弗一眼，还用拳头在旁边的口袋上意味深长地敲了几下。","Sikes dismounted with great precipitation, holding Oliver by the hand all the while; and lifting him down directly, bestowed a furious look upon him, and rapped the side-pocket with his fist, in a significant manner."
"“再见了，孩子。”车夫说。","“Good-bye, boy,” said the man."
"“他不高兴了，”赛克斯和他握了握手，说道，“真的不高兴了。这小狗崽子！别介意。”","“He’s sulky,” replied Sikes, giving him a shake; “he’s sulky.A young dog!Don’t mind him.”"
"“我才不会！”车夫一边回答，一边上了马车，“无论如何，今儿个天气还真不错呢。”说罢他赶着车走了。","“Not I!” rejoined the other, getting into his cart.“It’s a fine day, after all.”And he drove away."
"一直等到车夫走得相当远了，赛克斯才开口对奥利弗说，如果他有兴致，还可以四处看看，接着又领着他上路了。","Sikes waited until he had fairly gone; and then, telling Oliver he might look about him if he wanted, once again led him onward on his journey."
"过了酒馆他们又走了一小段路，然后往左一拐，沿着右手边的路走了很长时间。一路上，沿途道路两旁有很多大花园和绅士的豪宅。他们一直走到一个镇上才歇脚，中间只停下来喝过些啤酒。在这里，奥利弗看到一所房子的墙上写着“汉普顿”三个大字。他们在田里转悠了几个小时。最后他们回到了镇上，进了一家招牌面目全非的酒馆，在厨房炉火旁边点了些晚餐。","They turned round to the left, a short way past the public-house; and then, taking a right-hand road, walked on for a long time: passing many large gardens and gentlemen’s houses on both sides of the way, and stopping for nothing but a little beer, until they reached a town. Here against the wall of a house, Oliver saw written up in pretty large letters, “Hampton.”They lingered about, in the fields, for some hours.At length they came back into the town; and, turning into an old public-house with a defaced sign-board, ordered some dinner by the kitchen fire."
"厨房很老旧，屋顶低矮，一条大梁横穿过天花板。火炉旁边有几条靠背很高的长板凳，几个身穿长罩衫的粗鲁男人正坐在上面抽烟喝酒。他们没有理会奥利弗，也几乎没怎么注意赛克斯；赛克斯同样对他们视而不见，只是和他的小同伴两人坐在一个角落里，没怎么受到旁边人的打扰。","The kitchen was an old, low-roofed room; with a great beam across the middle of the ceiling, and benches, with high backs to them, by the fire; on which were seated several rough men in smock-frocks, drinking and smoking.They took no notice of Oliver; and very little of Sikes; and, as Sikes took very little notice of them, he and his young comrade sat in a corner by themselves, without being much troubled by their company."
"他们晚餐吃了点冷肉，然后坐了很久。这期间赛克斯先生一直沉醉于吞云吐雾，共抽了三四管烟，奥利弗开始觉得，他们肯定不会再赶路了。他早上起得很早，赶路又很累人，起先他就小眯了一会儿；后来实在架不住疲劳，又闻着烟草的味道，就睡着了。","They had some cold meat for dinner, and sat so long after it, while Mr. Sikes indulged himself with three or four pipes, that Oliver began to feel quite certain they were not going any further.Being much tired with the walk, and getting up so early, he dozed a little at first; then, quite overpowered by fatigue and the fumes of the tobacco, fell asleep."
"赛克斯推醒他的时候，天已经相当黑了。当奥利弗振作精神，勉强能坐起来看看四周时，他发现这位名流正和一名劳工模样的人一起喝一品脱啤酒，关系甚密，交谈投机。","It was quite dark when he was awakened by a push from Sikes.Rousing himself sufficiently to sit up and look about him, he found that worthy in close fellowship and communication with a labouring man, over a pint of ale."
"“那么，你是要去下哈利佛德，对吧？”赛克斯询问道。","“So, you’re going on to Lower Halliford, are you?” inquired Sikes."
"“是啊。”那个人回答说。他似乎喝得有点醉意了——但这在这种情况下可能是件好事，“也不会很慢。我的马回去拉的是空车，不像早上来的时候有货。它也不能再拉多久了。祝它好运吧。呃嗝！它真是匹好马！”","“Yes, I am,” replied the man, who seemed a little the worse—or better, as the case might be—for drinking; “and not slow about it neither.My horse hasn’t got a load behind him going back, as he had coming up in the mornin’; and he won’t be long a-doing of it.Here’s luck to him.Ecod! he’s a good ’un!” "
"“您能把我和我儿子捎到那儿吗？”赛克斯边提着要求，边把啤酒推到了他新朋友的面前。","“Could you give my boy and me a lift as far as there?” demanded Sikes, pushing the ale towards his new friend. "
"“如果你们马上就走的话，可以。”那人从酒罐后面看过来，回答说，“你们要去哈利佛德？”","“If you’re going directly, I can,” replied the man, looking out of the pot.“Are you going to Halliford?”"
"“要去谢普顿。”赛克斯答道。","“Going on to Shepperton,” replied Sikes."
"“只要是我能走到的地方，您尽管吩咐。”那人接口道,“买单了么，贝基？”","“I’m your man, as far as I go,” replied the other.“Is all paid, Becky?”"
"“买了，那位先生已经买过了。”女孩应道。","“Yes, the other gentleman’s paid,” replied the girl."
"“我说！”那人说，他虽然醉了酒，态度倒还相当庄重，“那可不行，您知道的。”","“I say!” said the man, with tipsy gravity; “that won’t do, you know.”"
"“有什么不行的？”赛克斯应道，“您收留了我们，还不许我请你喝一品脱啤酒什么的，当做回报吗？”","“Why not?” rejoined Sikes.“You’re a-going to accommodate us, and wot’s to prevent my standing treat for a pint or so, in return?”"
"那陌生人神色凝重地想了想他的话，然后抓住了赛克斯的手，称他是个真真正正的好人。赛克斯先生回应说对方只是开玩笑罢了；如果那人够清醒的话，就有充足的理由相信，他自己说的话是不作数的。","The stranger reflected upon this argument, with a very profound face; having done so, he seized Sikes by the hand: and declared he was a real good fellow.To which Mr. Sikes replied, he was joking; as, if he had been sober, there would have been strong reason to suppose he was."
"他们又相互恭维了几句，然后互道晚安，走了出去。趁着这会儿功夫，女孩收拾了一下桌子，正懒洋洋地往门外走，想要去看热闹；她的两只手上都还捧着酒罐和玻璃杯。","After the exchange of a few more compliments, they bade the company good-night, and went out; the girl gathering up the pots and glasses as they did so, and lounging out to the door, with her hands full, to see the party start."
"那匹马已经套在了车上，此时正站在外头；浑然不知在自己不在场的时候，已经被人敬过酒、祝过健康了。奥利弗和赛克斯没有再客气，直接就上了车。马的主人为了“给它打打气”，又磨蹭了一两分钟，还相当不屑地说，骡马夫乃至全世界都没本事，养不出能跟他这匹并驾齐驱的好马，然后才上了车。接着他知会骡马夫放马。马被松了缰以后，做了一件令人很不愉快的事：它不屑地把头在空中甩了甩，还一路跑起，撞进了对面会客厅的窗户里。表演完了这些特技以后，它又前腿腾空挺了一会儿，然后迅速开跑，英姿飒爽地飞奔出了镇。","The horse, whose health had been drunk in his absence, was standing outside: ready harnessed to the cart.Oliver and Sikes got in without any further ceremony; and the man to whom he belonged, having lingered for a minute or two “to bear him up”, and to defy the hostler and the world to produce his equal, mounted also.Then, the hostler was told to give the horse his head; and, his head being given him, he made a very unpleasant use of it: tossing it into the air with great disdain, and running into the parlour windows over the way; after performing those feats, and supporting himself for a short time on his hind-legs, he started off at great speed, and rattled out of the town right gallantly. "
"这一夜天特别黑。一股潮湿的雾气从河面和沼泽地上慢慢飘起，向四周蔓延开来，笼罩了整个沉闷的田地。天也冷，冷得刺骨；周围一片阴郁昏暗，黑得伸手不见五指。几个人一言不发。车夫已经昏昏欲睡了，而赛克斯也没有心情与他攀谈。奥利弗蜷成一团坐在马车的一角，他忐忑不安，惊恐难言，满心都是困惑不解；在他的想象中，枯树丛里面藏着奇怪的东西。那些枯枝晃来晃去，十分可怖，似乎因为这片荒凉的景色而莫名地狂喜。","The night was very dark.A damp mist rose from the river, and the marshy ground about; and spread itself over the dreary fields.It was piercing cold, too; all was gloomy and black.Not a word was spoken; for the driver had grown sleepy; and Sikes was in no mood to lead him into conversation.Oliver sat huddled together, in a corner of the cart; bewildered with alarm and apprehension; and figuring strange objects in the gaunt trees, whose branches waved grimly to and fro, as if in some fantastic joy at the desolation of the scene."
"他们经过森伯里教堂时，教堂的钟敲了七下。对面渡口灯塔的窗户里点着一盏灯，灯光照过大路，将一棵黑黝黝的杉树和树下的坟墓一道投入了更加昏暗的阴影中。不远的地方传来水流泄地的声音，很是沉闷；夜风中老树的叶子正轻轻地摇摆。那声音听上去像是为使死者安息所奏的哀乐。","As they passed Sunbury Church, the clock struck seven.There was a light in the ferry-house window opposite: which streamed across the road, and threw into more sombre shadow a dark yew-tree with graves beneath it.There was a dull sound of falling water not far off; and the leaves of the old tree stirred gently in the night wind.It seemed like quiet music for the repose of the dead."
"他们穿过了森伯里，又一次走上了寂寥的大道。又走了两三英里，马车停了下来。赛克斯下了车，抓住了奥利弗的手，两人又再一次徒步上路。","Sunbury was passed through, and they came again into the lonely road.Two or three miles more, and the cart stopped.Sikes alighted, took Oliver by the hand, and they once again walked on."
"那个疲惫的男孩满心期待，希望能在谢普顿找所房子，稍作休息。可惜他们没这么做，只是一刻不停地继续往前走。沿途一片漆黑；他们在泥泞中深一脚浅一脚地走着，穿过阴暗的小巷，走过冰冷的旷野，直到可以望见不远处小镇里的点点灯光。奥利弗仔细往前看了看，发现水正从他们脚下流过，而他们此时正往桥墩走去。","They turned into no house at Shepperton, as the weary boy had expected; but still kept walking on, in mud and darkness, through gloomy lanes and over cold open wastes, until they came within sight of the lights of a town at no great distance.On looking intently forward, Oliver saw that the water was just below them, and that they were coming to the foot of a bridge."
"赛克斯径直往前走，到快上桥时却又突然一拐，沿着左侧的河岸走了下去。","Sikes kept straight on, until they were close upon the bridge; then turned suddenly down a bank upon the left."
"“有水！”奥利弗想到这，恐惧得难以自持，只觉得胃里一阵翻腾，“他把我带到这个荒凉的地方,为的是要在这儿杀了我！”","“The water!” thought Oliver, turning sick with fear.“He has brought me to this lonely place to murder me!”"
"他刚要扑倒在地，为自己年轻的生命作最后一搏，却发现他们此时正站在一所孤零零的房子前，一所破破烂烂、腐朽不堪的房子前。房子的大门也是年久失修，门口两侧各有一扇窗；楼上还有一层楼，但是看不到半点光亮。这房子七零八散，里面又是漆黑一片，怎么看都像是没人住的。","He was about to throw himself on the ground, and make one struggle for his young life, when he saw that they stood before a solitary house: all ruinous and decayed.There was a window on each side of the dilapidated entrance; and one story above; but no light was visible.The house was dark, dismantled: and the all appearance, uninhabited."
"赛克斯一刻都没松开过奥利弗的手，他拉着奥利弗轻轻地走近低矮的门廊，提起了门闩。他一使劲，门就被打开了；两人一起走了进去。","Sikes, with Oliver’s hand still in his, softly approached the low porch, and raised the latch.The door yielded to the pressure, and they passed in together."
"第二十二章 夜盗","CHAPTER XXII The Burglary "
"“喂！”他们刚踏进走廊，一个沙哑的大嗓门就喊了起来。","“Hallo!” cried a loud, hoarse voice, as soon as they set foot in the passage."
"“别吵。”赛克斯一边说，一边插上门闩，“托比，借个光。”","“Don’t make such a row,” said Sikes, bolting the door.“Show a glim, Toby.”"
"“啊哈！我的老伙计！”那个声音又喊道，“来点儿光，巴尼，来点儿光！领那位绅士进来，巴尼。要是方便的话，先把你自己弄醒。”","“Aha! my pal!” cried the same voice.“A glim, Barney, a glim!Show the gentleman in, Barney; wake up first, if convenient.”"
"说话的人为了把他招呼的人从熟睡中叫醒，像是朝他扔了个鞋拔子之类的东西，只听见有木器猛然落地的声音传来。接着又响起了模糊不清的嘟囔声，像是个半睡半醒的人正在低声抱怨。","The speaker appeared to throw a boot-jack, or some such article, at the person he addressed, to rouse him from his slumbers: for the noise of a wooden body, falling violently, was heard; and then an indistinct muttering, as of a man between sleep and awake. "
"“你听见没有？”那声音叫道，“比尔·赛克斯在门廊里，没人招呼。你反而睡在那里，像是把鸦片酊就着饭吃了，没吃别的长力气的东西似的。现在清醒点儿了吧？或者你想要我拿个铁烛台过去，帮你彻底清醒一下？”","“Do you hear?” cried the same voice.“There’s Bill Sikes in the passage with nobody to do the civil to him; and you sleeping there, as if you took laudanum with your meals, and nothing stronger.Are you any fresher now, or do you want the iron candlestick to wake you thoroughly?”"
"这番责问还没停，就听见有人穿着拖鞋，急急忙忙、踢踢踏踏地穿过了没铺地板的房间。接着右手边的门口亮起了一根蜡烛，烛光很微弱，之后又出现了一个人影，就是前面提过的在萨弗伦山酒馆当侍者，说话还老带着鼻音的那个人。","A pair of slipshod feet shuffled, hastily, across the bare floor of the room, as this interrogatory was put; and there issued, from a door on the right hand; first, a feeble candle: and next, the form of the same individual who has been heretofore described as labouring under the infirmity of speaking through his nose, and officiating as waiter at the public-house on Saffron Hill."
"“比斯特·赛克斯！”巴尼叫道，别提有多高兴了，只是不知道是发自真心还是虚情假意。他还用拉丁语客气地招呼道：“请进，先生，请进来吧。”","“Bister Sikes!”  exclaimed Barney, with real or counterfeit joy; “cub id, sir; cub id.”"
"“来！你先上去。”赛克斯边说边把奥利弗推到了他身前，“快点儿！要不然我就要踩到你的脚后跟了。”","“Here! you get on first,” said Sikes, putting Oliver in front of him.“Quicker! or I shall tread upon your heels.”"
"赛克斯嫌奥利弗行动缓慢，嘟囔着骂了一句，推着他往前走。他们走进了一间又低又暗的房间，里头烧着火炉，室内烟雾缭绕；还有两三把破椅子、一张桌子、一张老沙发。一个男人手脚摊开躺在沙发上，腿跷得比头还高，正抽着一根长长的陶制烟斗。他穿着一件裁剪精致、带有大号铜纽扣的鼻烟色外套，围着一条橙色围巾，外面套了一件做工粗糙、颇为显眼的披肩式背心，下身穿一条土褐色裤子。格拉基特先生（上述的人就是他）毛发不多，头上和脸上都显得有些光溜溜的；仅存的那些被染上了淡红的颜色，卷成了瓶塞起子般螺旋的长卷。他偶尔会把脏兮兮的手指插进头发里，手指上还戴着几个不值钱的大戒指。他的身材中等偏高，是个小人物，而且双腿看上去没什么力气，但这一现状丝毫无损于他对自己长靴的赞赏。此时他正注视着跷在高处的靴子，显出愉快而满意的神情。","Muttering a curse upon his tardiness, Sikes pushed Oliver before him; and they entered a low dark room with a smoky fire, two or three broken chairs, a table, and a very old couch: on which, with his legs much higher than his head, a man was reposing at full length, smoking a long clay pipe.He was dressed in a smartly-cut snuff-coloured coat, with large brass buttons; an orange neckerchief; a coarse, staring, shawl-pattern waistcoat; and drab breeches.Mr. Crackit (for he it was) had no very great quantity of hair, either upon his head or face; but what he had, was of a reddish dye, and tortured into long corkscrew curls, through which he occasionally thrust some very dirty fingers, ornamented with large common rings.He was a trifle above the middle size, and apparently rather weak in the legs; but this circumstance by no means detracted from his own admiration of his top-boots, which he contemplated, in their elevated situation, with lively satisfaction."
"“比尔，我的老伙计！”那个人扭头冲着门说，“见到你真高兴。我都有点儿担心你已经放弃了，那样的话我就要自己单干了。嘿！”","“Bill, my boy!” said this figure, turning his head towards the door, “I’m glad to see you.I was almost afraid you’d given it up: in which case I should have made a personal wentur.Hallo!”"
"托比·格拉基特的目光一落到奥利弗身上，就发出了这声感叹，语气里满是讶异。他坐了起来，接着问起那人是谁。","Uttering this exclamation in a tone of great surprise, as his eyes rested on Oliver, Mr. Toby Crackit brought himself into a sitting posture, and demanded who that was."
"“那个男孩，就是那个男孩！”赛克斯一边回答，一边拉了把椅子走向火炉。","“The boy.Only the boy!” replied Sikes, drawing a chair towards the fire."
"“肯定是比斯特·费金的徒弟。”巴尼咧嘴笑着，大声说道。","“Wud of Bister Fagid’s lads,” exclaimed Barney, with a grin."
"“费金的徒弟，嗯！”托比看着奥利弗，也嚷了起来，“若要算计教堂里那些老太太的口袋，这男孩可是个宝贝！有那脸蛋儿是他的福气。”","“Fagin’s, eh!” exclaimed Toby, looking at Oliver.“Wot an inwalable boy that’ll make, for the old ladies’ pockets in chapels!His mug is a fortin to him.”"
"“嘿，扯够了吧。”赛克斯不耐烦地插嘴说。他弯腰凑近他那位坐在沙发上的伙计，在他耳边嘀咕了几句话。格拉基特先生听罢大笑起来，然后又吃惊地盯着奥利弗看了很长时间。","“There—there’s enough of that,” interposed Sikes, impatiently; and stooping over his recumbant friend, he whispered a few words in his ear: at which Mr. Crackit laughed immensely, and honoured Oliver with a long stare of astonishment."
"“好了。”赛克斯回到自己座位上说，“在我们等的这段时候，给我们弄点吃的喝的。不管怎么说，这能帮我们，至少能帮我，振奋振奋精神。来烤烤火，小伙子，休息一下。今天晚上你还得跟我们出去，尽管路不是很远。”","“Now,” said Sikes, as he resumed his seat, “if you’ll give us something to eat and drink while we’re waiting, you’ll put some heart in us; or in me, at all events.Sit down by the fire, younker, and rest yourself; for you’ll have to go out with us again to-night, though not very far off.”"
"奥利弗没说话，只是怯生生地看了看赛克斯，一副懵懂的样子，然后他拉了个凳子坐到火边，拿双手托着发疼的脑袋。他既对自己在哪里一无所知，也不明白身边正在发生什么事情。","Oliver looked at Sikes, in mute and timid wonder; and drawing a stool to the fire, sat with his aching head upon his hands, scarecely knowing where he was, or what was passing around him."
"“来，”托比说，“祝成功！”那个年轻的犹太人则在桌子上放了些零碎的食物和一瓶酒。托比站起来祝酒，然后小心翼翼地把空烟斗放在一个角落里，接着又向前走到桌边，满满倒了一杯烈酒，一饮而尽。赛克斯也照样喝了一杯。","“Here,” said Toby, as the young Jew placed some fragments of food, and a bottle upon the table, “Success to the crack!”He rose to honour the toast; and, carefully depositing his empty pipe in a corner, advanced to the table, filled a glass with spirits, and drank off its contents.Mr. Sikes did the same."
"“让这孩子也喝点儿，”托比边说边倒了半杯酒，“干了它，小天真。”","“A drain for the boy,” said Toby, half-filling a wine-glass.“Down with it, innocence.”"
"“其实，”奥利弗可怜巴巴地看着那人的脸说，“其实我真的——”“干了它！”托比重复道，“你以为我不知道什么对你有好处？比尔，让他把酒喝了。”","“Indeed,” said Oliver, looking piteously up into the man’s face; “indeed, I—” “Down with it!” echoed Toby.“Do you think I don’t know what’s good for you?Tell him to drink it, Bill.”"
"“他最好是喝下去！”赛克斯把手在口袋上一放，如是说。“真急人，他简直比一家子机灵鬼还麻烦。喝了它，任性的小子，快喝！”","“He had better!” said Sikes clapping his hand upon his pocket.“Burn my body, if he isn’t more trouble than a whole family of Dodgers.Drink it, you perwerse imp; drink it!”"
"奥利弗被这两个男人凶神恶煞的样子吓坏了，他慌慌张张地咽下杯子里的酒，立即剧烈地咳嗽起来。托比·格拉基特和巴尼都被他逗乐了，甚至连严肃的赛克斯先生脸上也露出了一丝笑容。","Frightened by the menacing gestures of the two men, Oliver hastily swallowed the contents of the glass, and immediately fell into a violent fit of coughing: which delighted Toby Crackit and Barney, and even drew a smile from the surly Mr. Sikes."
"这之后，赛克斯好好地满足了一下他的胃（奥利弗什么都吃不下，只是在他们的逼迫下吃了一片面包），那两个男人则倒在椅子上打起盹来。奥利弗仍然坐在炉火边的凳子上；巴尼裹着毯子，紧挨着挡灰板，双手双脚摊开着在地板上躺了下来。","This done, and Sikes having satisfied his appetite (Oliver could eat nothing but a small crust of bread which they made him swallow), the two men laid themselves down on chairs for a short nap.Oliver retained his stool by the fire; Barney wrapped in a blanket, stretched himself on the floor: close outside the fender."
"他们睡了有一会儿，至少从表面看是这样。大家都一动不动，只有巴尼起来过一两次，往炉子里添煤。奥利弗睡得很熟，在梦中他好像在阴郁的小巷里迷了路，或者在黑漆漆的教堂墓地周围游荡，又或者重回了昨天经过的某个场景。突然，托比·格拉基特跳起来，大叫着说已经一点半了，这才吵醒了奥利弗。","They slept, or appeared to sleep, for some time; nobody stirring but Barney, who rose once or twice to throw coals on the fire.Oliver fell into a heavy doze: imagining himself straying along the gloomy lanes, or wandering about the dark churchyard, or retracing some one or other of the scenes of the past day: when he was roused by Toby Crackit jumping up and declaring it was half-past one."
"另外两个男人也在瞬间站了起来，所有人都积极地投入到繁忙的准备中。赛克斯和他同伴各自用大块黑色的披肩把脖子和下巴都裹了起来，又穿上了大衣。巴尼打开柜橱，从里面拿出几样东西，急急忙忙地塞进口袋里。","In an instant, the other two were on their legs, and all were actively engaged in busy preparation.Sikes and his companion enveloped their necks and chins in large dark shawls, and drew on their great-coats; Barney, opening a cupboard, brought forth several articles, which he hastily crammed into the pockets."
"“巴尼，把手枪给我。”托比·格拉基特说。","“Barkers for me, Barney,” said Toby Crackit."
"“给你。”巴尼应道，取出两把手枪，“你自己上的子弹。”","“Here they are,” replied Barney, producing a pair of pistols.“You loaded them yourself.”"
"“好的！”托比应道，把手枪藏了起来，“别的家伙呢？”","“All right!” replied Toby, stowing them away.“The persuaders?”"
"“在我这儿呢。”赛克斯回答。","“I’ve got ’em,” replied Sikes."
"“面纱、钥匙、转柄钻、夜行灯——没有落下什么吧？”托比一边问，一边把撬棍拴在大衣下摆里面的套环上。","“Crape, keys, centre-bits, darkies—nothing forgotten?” inquired Toby: fastening a small crowbar to a loop inside the skirt of his coat."
"“都准备好了。”他的同伴回应道，“给他们带点木材去，巴尼。这就对了。”","“All right,” rejoined his companion.“Bring them bits of timber, Barney.That’s the time of day.”"
"说罢，他从巴尼手里接过一根大棒。巴尼给托比也递了一根，然后又埋头为奥利弗戴斗篷。","With these words, he took a thick stick from Barney’s hands, who, having delivered another to Toby, busied himself in fastening on Oliver’s cape."
"“出发！”赛克斯把手往前一伸，说道。","“Now then!” said Sikes, holding out his hand."
"奥利弗以前很少走这么长的路，也没经历过这种气氛，更没被逼喝过酒，此时已是目瞪口呆了。赛克斯伸手去拉他，他就呆呆地把手放到赛克斯手里，动作僵硬，像个机器似的。","Oliver: who was completely stupified by the unwonted exercise, and the air, and the drink which had been forced upon him: put his hand mechanically into that which Sikes extended for the purpose."
"“托比，抓住他另一只手。”赛克斯说，“看看外面情况，巴尼。”","“Take his other hand, Toby,” said Sikes.“Look out, Barney.”"
"巴尼走到门边，回来时说外面一片寂静。这两个强盗便把奥利弗夹在中间，出发了。巴尼拴好了所有的门窗，像之前一样把自己裹好，很快又睡着了。","The man went to the door, and returned to announce that all was quiet.The two robbers issued forth with Oliver between them.Barney, having made all fast, rolled himself up as before, and was soon asleep again."
"此时天已经漆黑一片。雾比前半夜浓多了，尽管没下雨，但空气依然很潮湿，四周还漂浮着半凝结的水汽。离开房子还没过几分钟，奥利弗的头发和眉毛就都被水汽粘得硬邦邦了。他们过了桥，一直朝着他之前看见的那片灯光走去。他们本来就离那儿不远，走得又特别快，所以不一会儿他们就到了杰茨。","It was now intensely dark.The fog was much heavier than it had been in the early part of the night; and the atmosphere was so damp, that, although no rain fell, Oliver’s hair and eyebrows, within a few minutes after leaving the house, had become stiff with the half-frozen moisture that was floating about.They crossed the bridge, and kept on towards the lights which he had seen before.They were at no great distance off; and, as they walked pretty briskly, they soon arrived at Chertsey."
"“走快点，穿过镇子。”赛克斯小声说，“今天晚上不会有碍事的人看见我们。”","“Slap through the town,” whispered Sikes; “there’ll be nobody in the way, to-night, to see us.”"
"托比默许了。他们匆忙穿过小镇的主道；这么晚了，路上根本没人。有时候会从某间卧室的窗户里映出昏暗的灯光，偶尔会有沙哑的狗叫声打破这黑夜的寂静。但是街上一个人都没有。当教堂的钟响了两下时，他们已经穿过了小镇。","Toby acquiesced; and they hurried through the main street of the little town, which at that late hour was wholly deserted.A dim light shone at intervals from some bed-room window; and the hoarse barking of dogs occasionally broke the silence of the night.But there was nobody abroad.They had cleared the town, as the church-bell struck two."
"他们加快脚步，走上了左手边的大道。走了大约四分之一英里后，他们在一所四面环墙的孤房前停了下来。托比·格拉基斯几乎没停下来喘口气，一眨眼就爬上了墙头。","Quickening their pace, they turned up a road upon the left hand.After walking about a quarter of a mile, they stopped before a detached house surrounded by a wall: to the top of which, Toby Crackit, scarcely pausing to take breath, climbed in a twinkling."
"“接下来轮到这孩子上。”托比说，“把他举上来，我来抓住他。”","“The boy next,” said Toby.“Hoist him up; I’ll catch hold of him.”"
"赛克斯一把抓过奥利弗，连朝四周看看的时间都没给他，双手就在他胳肢窝里一撑；三四秒钟后，他就已经和托比一道，躺在墙另一边的草地上了。赛克斯很快也翻了进来。他们蹑手蹑脚地朝那所房子走去。","Before Oliver had time to look round, Sikes had caught him under the arms; and in three or four seconds he and Toby were lying on the grass on the other side.Sikes followed directly.And they stole cautiously towards the house."
"直到现在，几乎被悲痛和恐惧逼疯的奥利弗才开始明白，他们这次远行的目的不是谋杀，就是入室抢劫。他把双手扣在一起，不自觉地发出一声沉闷的惊叫。他的双眼模糊，惨白的脸上直冒冷汗，两腿一软跪在了地上。","And now, for the first time, Oliver, well-nigh mad with grief and terror, saw that housebreaking and robbery, if not murder, were the objects of the expedition.He clasped his hands together, and involuntarily uttered a subdued exclamation of horror.A mist came before his eyes; the cold sweat stood upon his ashy face; his limbs failed him; and he sank upon his knees."
"“起来！”赛克斯气得直哆嗦，从口袋里掏出手枪，低声说，“起来，要不然我就让你脑浆迸裂，全撒在这草地上。”","“Get up!” murmured Sikes, trembling with rage, and drawing the pistol from his pocket; “Get up, or I’ll strew your brains upon the grass.”"
"“噢！看在上帝的份上，让我走吧！”奥利弗哭喊道，“让我跑出去，死在野地里吧。我再也不走近伦敦了，再也不了，再也不了！噢！求你们发发慈悲，不要让我偷东西。看在天堂中所有慈爱的光明天使的份上，可怜可怜我吧！”","“Oh! for God’s sake let me go!” cried Oliver; “let me run away and die in the fields.I will never come near London; never, never!Oh! pray have mercy on me, and do not make me steal.For the love of all the bright Angels that rest in Heaven, have mercy upon me!”"
"那人听了他这番请求，咒骂了一句，扣上了扳机。这时托比一把打掉那人手里的枪，用手捂住孩子的嘴，把他拖进了那所房子。","The man to whom this appeal was made, swore a dreadful oath, and had cocked the pistol, when Toby, striking it from his grasp, placed his hand upon the boy’s mouth, and dragged him to the house."
"“嘘！”托比叫道，“这一套在这里没用。你要再说一个字，我就亲自修理你，叫你脑袋开花。那都不会出一点儿声音，相当可靠，还不落俗套。来，比尔，把百叶窗撬开。我敢说，他现在胆子够大了。我见过年纪和他差不多但经验更足的老手做这事，就算是在大冷天的晚上，也能在一两分钟内搞定。”","“Hush!” cried the man; “it won’t answer here.Say another word, and I’ll do your business myself with a crack on the head.That makes no noise, and is quite as certain, and more genteel.Here, Bill, wrench the shutter open.He’s game enough now, I’ll engage.I’ve  seen older hands of his age took the same way, for a minute or two, on a cold night.”"
"赛克斯一边在心里把费金骂了个狗血喷头，怪他派奥利弗来做这差事，一边卯足了劲、却又悄无声息地将撬棍往下压。他中间耽搁了一会儿，托比后来又搭了把手，才把那扇窗户撬开了些。","Sikes, invoking terrific imprecations upon Fagin’s head for sending Oliver on such an errand, plied the crowbar vigorously, but with little noise.After some delay, and some assistance from Toby, the shutter to which he had referred, swung open on its hinges."
"那是一扇很小的格子窗，离地面大约有五英尺半的距离，开在房间的后面，可能是走廊尽头的洗涤室或者小酿酒间的窗户。窗口很小，以至于房子里的人很可能觉得，对这里再多加防范不值得，但这窗口却足以让一个像奥利弗这样大小的孩子钻进去。尽管窗子还有铰链拴着，但赛克斯先生略显了一下他的手段，没多久窗口就完全打开了。","It was a little lattice window, about five feet and a half above the ground, at the back of the house: which belonged to a scullery, or small brewing-place, at the end of the passage.The aperture was so small, that the inmates had probably not thought it worth while to defend it more securely; but it was large enough to admit a boy of Oliver’s size, nevertheless.A very brief exercise of Mr. Sike’s art, sufficed to overcome the fastening of the lattice; and it soon stood wide open also."
"“听着，小兔崽子，”赛克斯低声说道，从口袋里掏出一盏遮光的提灯，把灯光直冲着奥利弗的脸，“我要把你放进那里。你拿着这盏灯，悄悄地走上你正前方的台阶。之后你就沿着那小厅走，一直走到临街的大门，把门打开，放我们进去。”","“Now listen, you young limb,” whispered Sikes, drawing a dark lantern from his pocket, and throwing the glare full on Oliver’s face; “I’m a going to put you through there.Take this light; go softly up the steps straight afore you, and along the little hall, to the street door; unfasten it, and let us in.”"
"“门顶上有门闩，你够不着。”托比插嘴说，“拿一把厅里的椅子，踩上去。那里共有三把。对了比尔，椅子上面还有巨大的蓝色独角兽和金色的草叉组成的图案，那是老太太的纹章。”","“There’s a bolt at the top, you won’t be able to reach,” interposed Toby.“Stand upon one of the hall chairs.There are three there, Bill, with a jolly large blue unicorn and gold pitchfork on ’em: which is the old lady’s arms.”"
"“你就不能安静点儿吗？”赛克斯脸色一凛，威胁似的回了他一句，又问道，“通往房间的门开着，对吧？”","“Keep quiet, can’t you?” replied Sikes, with a threatening look.“The room-door is open, is it?”"
"“大开着。”托比回答道，保险起见，他还往里面瞥了一眼，“有趣的是，他们总是把门开着，只留个吊钩挂着。他们家狗在屋里有窝，那样它睡不着的时候就可以在走廊里走来走去。哈！哈！巴尼今天晚上把狗引开了。干得漂亮！”","“Wide,” replied Toby, after peeping in to satisfy himself.“The game of that is, that they always leave it open with a catch, so that the dog, who’s got a bed in here, may walk up and down the passage when he feels wakeful. Ha! ha!Barney “ticed him away to-night.So neat!”"
"尽管格拉基特先生说话的声音低得几乎听不见，也没笑出声来，赛克斯还是专横地命令他安静点，赶紧去干活。托比不吱声了。他先把提灯拿出来搁在地上，接着用脑袋顶着窗户下面的墙，双手撑在膝盖上，稳稳地站定，用背搭成了一级台阶。台阶刚搭好，赛克斯就爬到他背上，把奥利弗双脚冲前顺着窗户放了进去，动作放得很轻。奥利弗被稳稳地放到了屋里的地板上，赛克斯却一直没有松开他的衣领。","Although Mr. Crackit spoke in a scarcely audible whisper, and laughed without noise, Sikes imperiously commanded him to be silent, and to get to work.Toby complied, by first producing his lantern, and placing it on the ground; then by planting himself firmly with his head against the wall beneath the window, and his hands upon his knees, so as to make a step of his back.This was no sooner done, than Sikes, mounting upon him, put Oiver gently through the window with his feet first; and, without leaving hold of his collar, planted him safely on the floor inside."
"“拿上这盏灯。”赛克斯往屋子里面瞧了瞧，说道，“你看到前面的楼梯了么？”","“Take this lantern,” said Sikes, looking into the room.“You see the stairs afore you?”"
"奥利弗此时出气比进气多，喘着回答道：“看到了。”赛克斯用枪筒指了指当街的大门，简单明了地提醒他注意，他一直都会在射程以内；如果他犹豫不前，立即就会倒地送命。","Oliver, more dead than alive, gasped out, “Yes.”Sikes, pointing to the street-door with the pistol-barrel, briefly advised him to take notice that he was within shot all the way; and that if he faltered, he would fall dead that instant."
"“一分钟就能完事。”赛克斯的声音依旧很低沉，“我一放手你就立即行动。听！”","“It’s done in a minute,” said Sikes, in the same low whisper.“Directly I leave go of you, do your work.Hark!”"
"“什么声音？”另一个家伙低声问。","“What’s that?” whispered the other man."
"他们竖起耳朵仔细听了听。","They listened intently."
"“没事。”赛克斯说着，放开了奥利弗，“就是现在！”","“Nothing,” said Sikes, releasing his hold of Oliver.“Now!”"
"在这短短的时间内，奥利弗恢复了神智。他下定决心，不管他会不会被打死，他一定要勉力一试，从厅里冲到楼上去，向这家人示警。他拿定主意后，立即偷偷摸摸地往前走去。","In the short time he had had to collect his senses, the boy had firmly resolved that, whether he died in the attempt or not, he would make one effort to dart upstairs from the hall, and alarm the family.Filled with this idea, he advanced at once, but stealthily."
"“回来！”赛克斯突然大声叫道，“回来！回来！”","“Come back!” suddenly cried Sikes aloud.“Back! back!”"
"周围的死寂突然被打破，随后又传来一声大叫，奥利弗吓得丢掉了手里的提灯，不知道应该往前走还是逃跑。","Scared by the sudden breaking of the dead stillness of the place, and by a loud cry which followed it, Oliver let his lantern fall, and knew not whether to advance or fly."
"叫声继续传来——一盏灯亮了起来——两个惊吓万分、衣衫不整的男人的身影出现在楼梯顶上，在他眼前一闪而过——火光一闪——一声巨响——一团烟腾起——不知哪里传来碰撞的声音——他踉踉跄跄地退了回去。","The cry was repeated—a light appeared—a vision of two terrified half-dressed men at the top of the stairs swam before his eyes—a flash—a loud noise—a smoke—a crash somewhere, but where he knew not,—and he staggered back."
"赛克斯消失了一会儿，随后又出现了；烟雾散开之前，他已经抓住了奥利弗的衣领。他在那两个男人开火之后也开了枪，但他们早已躲了起来，他又把奥利弗拖了起来。","Sikes had disappeared for an instant; but he was up again, and had him by the collar before the smoke had cleared away.He fired his own pistol after the men, who were already retreating; and dragged the boy up."
"“把你的胳膊再抱紧一些。”赛克斯一边把奥利弗从窗户里面拽出来，一边说，“给我一块披肩。他们打中他了。快点儿！这孩子淌了好多血！”","“Clasp your arm tighter,” said Sikes, as he drew him through the window.“Give me a shawl here.They’ve  hit him.Quick!How the boy bleeds!”"
"响亮的警铃声随之传来，其中还混杂着枪声和男人的叫喊声。奥利弗感觉到自己被人抬着，在高低不平的地上迅速移动。然后，远处的嘈杂逐渐模糊。一股冰冷的、死一般的感觉爬进了孩子心底，他就再也看不到、听不见什么了。","Then came the loud ringing of a bell, mingled with the noise of fire-arms, and the shouts of men, and the sensation of being carried over uneven ground at a rapid pace.And then, the noises grew confused in the distance; and a cold deadly feeling crept over the boy’s heart; and he saw or heard no more."
"第二十三章 本章讲述邦布尔先生和一位女士进行的一次愉快的谈话，还包括这番谈话的具体内容，表明就算是一名教区执事，有时候也会为感情左右","CHAPTER XXIII Which contains the substance of a pleasant conversation between Mr. Bumble and a lady; and shows that even a beadle may be susceptible on some points "
"那天晚上极其寒冷。雪覆盖在地面上，结成一层厚厚的硬壳，只有被吹到一旁小路和角落里的积雪还受到呼啸而过的劲风的影响。狂风似乎要朝它找到的这些猎物发泄积聚起来的怒火，它野蛮地把地上的雪抓向云端，卷成上千雾蒙蒙的漩涡，撒满天空。这是一个阴沉而昏暗的夜晚，刺骨地冷。这样的夜晚适合食宿优越的人围在明亮的炉火旁，感谢上帝他们身在家中；那些无家可归、饥寒交迫的可怜人，只能倒在地上，凄然死去。很多饥肠辘辘的流浪者在空荡荡的街道上闭上了眼睛。这种时候，他们不关心自己究竟有何罪过了，反正也很难在一个更加悲惨的世界里睁开眼睛。","The night was bitter cold.The snow lay on the ground, frozen into a hard thick crust, so that only the heaps that had drifted into byways and corners were affected by the sharp wind that howled abroad: which, as if expending increased fury on such prey as it found, caught it savagely up in clouds, and, whirling it into a thousand misty eddies, scattered it in air.Bleak, dark, and piercing cold, it was a night for the well-housed and fed to draw round the bright fire and thank God they were at home; and for the homeless, starving wretch to lay him down and die.Many hunger-worn outcasts close their eyes in our bare streets, at such times, who, let their crimes have been what they may, can hardly open them in a more bitter world."
"这是门外的情况。此时，济贫院的女主管科尼太太正坐在自己小房间里一团快活的炉火前，怡然自得地朝一张小圆桌看了一眼。这个济贫院也就是之前向读者介绍的奥利弗·特威斯特的出生地。桌子上有一个尺寸与其相当的托盘，里面装点着女主管们享用最满意的一餐所需的一切。事实上，科尼太太正要喝一杯茶来安慰自己。她把目光从桌子转到壁炉，壁炉里有一把顶小的壶正在用最细微的声音唱一支小曲；她内心的满足感顿增——这感觉如此强烈，连科尼太太都不禁微微笑了一下。","Such was the aspect of out-of-doors affairs, when Mrs. Corney, the matron of the workhouse to which our readers have been already introduced as the birthplace of Oliver Twist, sat herself down before a cheerful fire in her own little room, and glanced, with no small degree of complacency, at a small round table:on which stood a tray of corresponding size, furnished with all necessary materials for the most grateful meal that matrons enjoy.In fact, Mrs. Corney was about to solace herself with a cup of tea.As she glanced from the table to the fireplace, where the smallest of all possible kettles was singing a small song in a small voice, her inward satisfaction evidently increased,—so much so, indeed, that Mrs. Corney smiled."
"“嗯！”女主管把胳膊肘支在桌子上，若有所思地看着炉火说道，“我敢说我们所有人都有很多需要感恩的东西！很多很多，可惜我们没有意识到。啊！”","“Well!” said the matron, leaning her elbow on the table, and looking reflectively at the fire; “I’m sure we have all on us a great deal to be grateful for!A great deal, if we did but know it.Ah!”"
"科尼太太悲哀地摇摇头，好像在谴责那些不明白这一点的愚昧贫民。她把一根银汤匙（私人财产）深深地插进一个两盎司的锡茶壶里，开始泡茶。","Mrs. Corney shook her head mournfully, as if deploring the mental blindness of those paupers who did not know it; and thrusting a silver spoon (private property) into the inmost recesses of a two-ounce tin tea-caddy, proceeded to make the tea."
"然而一件极为微小的事情就能打破我们脆弱心灵的平静。那黑色的茶壶特别小，很容易装满。科尼太太考虑道德问题的时候水溢了出来，科尼太太的手被略微烫了一下。","How slight a thing will disturb the equanimity of our frail minds!The black teapot, being very small and easily filled, ran over while Mrs. Corney was moralising; and the water slightly scalded Mrs. Corney’s hand."
"“该死的茶壶！”可敬的女主管叫着，慌忙把茶壶放在炉盘上，“愚蠢的小东西，只能装几杯茶！这东西对谁能有点儿用处？除了，”科尼太太顿了一下，“除了像我一样孤零零的可怜人。天哪！”","“Drat the pot!” said the worthy matron, setting it down very hastily on the hob; “a little stupid thing, that only holds a couple of cups!What use is it of, to anybody!Except,” said Mrs. Corney, pausing, “except to a poor desolate creature like me.Oh dear!”"
"说着这些，女主管跌坐在椅子里，再一次把胳膊肘支在桌上，思考着她孤苦的命运。小小的茶壶、落单的茶杯，唤醒了她心中对科尼先生的悲伤回忆（他已经去世二十五年有余了），她再也承受不住了。","With these words, the matron dropped into her chair, and, once more resting her elbow on the table, thought of her solitary fate.The small teapot, and the single cup, had awakened in her mind sad recollections of Mr. Corney (who had not been dead more than five-and-twenty years); and she was overpowered."
"“我再也找不到另外一个了！”科尼太太焦躁地说，“再也找不到另外一个——像他那样的了。”","“I shall never get another!” said Mrs. Corney, pettishly; “I shall never get another—like him.”"
"谁也不知道这番话指的到底是她丈夫还是茶壶。应该是后者吧，因为科尼太太说话的时候看着茶壶，说完后还把它拿了起来。她刚品了品第一杯茶，就听见有人轻轻地敲了敲门，扰了她的兴致。","Whether this remark bore reference to the husband, or the teapot, is uncertain.It might have been the latter; for Mrs. Corney looked at it as she spoke; and took it up afterwards.She had just tasted her first cup, when she was disturbed by a soft tap at the room-door."
"“哦，自个儿进来吧！”科尼太太尖声说，“我猜肯定是哪个老婆子要死了。他们总是在我吃饭的时候死。别站在那里，冷气都进来了。有什么事，嗯？”","“Oh, come in with you!” said Mrs. Corney, sharply.“Some of the old women dying, I suppose.They always die when I’m at meals.Don’t stand there, letting the cold air in, don’t.What’s amiss now, eh?”"
"“没事，太太，没事。”回答她的是个男人的声音。","“Nothing, ma’am, nothing,” replied a man’s voice."
"“哎呦！”女主管叫道，声音立刻变得柔和多了，“是邦布尔先生吗？”","“Dear me!” exclaimed the matron, in a much sweeter tone, “is that Mr. Bumble?”"
"“愿意为您效劳，太太。”邦布尔先生应道。他刚才站在外面擦干净了鞋，抖落了大衣上的雪，现在终于露面了；只见他一只手拿着一个三角帽，另一只手提着一包东西，“我能把门关上吗，太太？”","“At your service, ma’am,” said Mr. Bumble, who had been stopping outside to rub his shoes clean, and to shake the snow off his coat; and who now made his appearance, bearing the cocked hat in one hand and a bundle in the other.“Shall I shut the door, ma’am?”"
"女主管回答前稍稍迟疑了一下，唯恐与邦布尔先生独处一室会有所不妥。邦布尔先生浑身冰冷，趁她犹豫的当口，没等她同意就把门关了。","The lady modestly hesitated to reply, lest there should be any impropriety in holding an interview with Mr. Bumble, with closed doors.Mr. Bumble taking advantage of the hesitation, and being very cold himself, shut it without permission."
"“真是个糟糕的天气，邦布尔先生。”女主管说。","“Hard weather, Mr. Bumble,” said the matron."
"“的确很糟，太太。”教区执事回答说。“这天气简直就是跟教区过不去，太太。在今天这个上帝保佑的下午，我们送出了，科尼太太，我们总共送出了四磅重的面包二十块，奶酪一块半，可这还不能满足那些贫民。”","“Hard, indeed, ma’am,” replied the beadle.“Anti-porochial weather this, ma’am.We have given away, Mrs. Corney, we have given away a matter of twenty quartern loaves and a cheese and a half, this very blessed afternoon; and yet them paupers are not contented.”"
"“当然满足不了。他们什么时候满足过啊，邦布尔先生？”女主管小口啜着茶说。","“Of course not.When would they be, Mr. Bumble?” said the matron, sipping her tea."
"“什么时候，谁说不是呢，太太！”邦布尔先生回应道。“咳，眼下就有这样一个男的，考虑到他有老婆和一大家子，发给他一块四磅重的面包和整整一磅奶酪，份量实足。他感恩了吗，太太？他感恩了吗？这连一个铜板都不值！他做了什么呢，太太，只是管我们要几块煤，说是只要满满的一手绢的量就行！煤！他要煤做什么？烤奶酪，然后再回来要更多。这些人就是这样，太太。今天给他们满满一围裙的煤，后天他们还会回来再要一围裙，脸皮跟雪花石膏一般厚。”","“When, indeed, ma’am!” rejoined Mr. Bumble.“Why here’s one man that, in consideration of his wife and large family, has a quartern loaf and a good pound of cheese, full weight.Is he grateful, ma’am?Is he grateful?Not a copper farthing’s worth of it!What does he do, ma’am, but ask for a few coals; if it’s only a pocket handkerchief full, he says!Coals!What would he do with coals?Toast his cheese with ’em and then come back for more.That’s the way with these people, ma’am; give ’em a apron full of coals to-day, and they’ll come back for another, the day after to-morrow, as brazen as alabaster.”"
"女主管表示，她完全赞同这一精妙的比喻，教区执事便继续抱怨，","The matron expressed her entire concurrence in this intelligible simile; and the beadle went on."
"“我从来没有，”邦布尔先生说，“看到任何事情变得这么离谱。”“前天，一个男人——您是结过婚的，太太，我跟您说说这事——那个男人，几乎是一丝不挂（听到这话科尼太太低头看向了地板），跑去我们监管家门口，当时监管正请人吃饭；他说自己必须领点接济，科尼太太。他不肯走，客人都被吓得不轻，我们监管就送给了他一磅土豆和半品脱燕麦片。‘天哪！’这个不领情的混账说，‘我拿这东西有什么用？你还不如给我一副铁制眼镜！’‘很好，’我们的监管把东西收了回来，说道，‘你从这里拿不到别的东西。’‘那我就死在大街上！’那个无赖说。‘噢不，你不会的。’我们的监管说。”","“I never,” said Mr. Bumble, “see anything like the pitch it’s got to.”“The day afore yesterday, a man—you have been a married woman, ma’am, and I may mention it to you—a man, with hardly a rag upon his back (here Mrs. Corney looked at the floor), goes to our overseer’s door when he has got company coming to dinner; and says, he must be relieved, Mrs. Corney.As he wouldn’t go away, and shocked the company very much, our overseer sent him out a pound of potatoes and half a pint of oatmeal.‘My heart!’ says the ungrateful villain, ‘what’s the use of-this- to me?You might as well give me a pair of iron spectacles!’‘Very good,’ says our overseer, taking ’em away again, ‘you won’t get anything else here.’‘Then I’ll die in the streets!’ says the vagrant.‘Oh no, you won’t, says our overseer.”"
"“哈！哈！太精彩了！这话听上去就像是格兰力特先生说的，不是么？”女主管插嘴说，“后来呢，邦布尔先生？”","“Ha! ha!That was very good!So like Mr. Grannett, wasn’t it?” interposed the matron.“Well, Mr. Bumble?”"
"“后来啊，太太。”教区执事回答说，“他就走了，然后他——真的就——死在了大街上。你看，这就是个固执的贫民！”","“Well, ma’am,” rejoined the beadle, “he went away; and he—did—die in the streets.There’s a obstinate pauper for you!”"
"“简直难以置信。”女主管断言,“但您不觉得无论如何，街头救济都是一件很糟糕的事吗，邦布尔先生？您是位经历丰富的绅士，您应该对此有所了解。快给我说说。”","“It beats anything I could have believed,” observed the matron emphatically.“But don’t you think out-of-door relief a very bad thing, any way, Mr. Bumble?You’re a gentleman of experience, and ought to know.Come.”"
"“科尼太太，”教区执事说道，脸上浮现出男人们掌握了高人一筹的信息时那种微笑，“街头救济，操作好的话，如果操作好的话，太太，能起到保护教区的作用。街头救济的重要原则是，分给贫民他们恰好不想要的东西，他们厌倦了，也就不来了。”","“Mrs. Corney,” said the beadle, smiling as men smile who are conscious of superior information, “out-of-door relief, properly managed: properly managed, ma’am: is the porochial safeguard.The great principle of out-of-door relief is, to give the paupers exactly what they don’t want; and then they get tired of coming.”"
"“天哪！”科尼太太叫道，“嗯，这也是个好办法！”","“Dear me!” exclaimed Mrs. Corney.“Well, that is a good one, too!”"
"“是啊。这也就我们俩之间说说，太太。”邦布尔先生回应道，“那就是重要的原则，也就是为什么，如果你看看那些放肆的报纸上随便哪个案子，你总会发现有病人的家庭得到的救济也就是几片奶酪。这就是现在的规矩，科尼太太，全国各地都这样。但是，”教区执事顿了顿，俯身去打开他的包裹，“这是官方机密，太太，不能讲的。除非，我这么说吧，是在你我这样在教区有职位的人之间传。这是波尔图葡萄酒，太太，是理事会专门给医务室的人员定购的。真正新酿的葡萄酒，非常醇正，今天上午才出的桶；这酒清澈得跟铃声似的，一点儿沉淀都没有！”","“Yes.Betwixt you and me, ma’am,” returned Mr. Bumble, “that’s the great principle; and that’s the reason why, if you look at any cases that get into them owdacious newspapers, you’ll always observe that sick families have been relieved with slices of cheese.That’s the rule now, Mrs. Corney, all over the country.But, however,” said the beadle, stopping to unpack his bundle, “these are official secrets, ma’am; not to be spoken of; except, as I may say, among the porochial officers, such as ourselves.This is the port wine, ma’am, that the board ordered for the infirmary; real, fresh, genuine port wine; only out of the cask this forenoon; clear as a bell, and no sediment!”"
"邦布尔先生拿起第一瓶酒对着灯光晃了晃，以测试它上等的品质，然后把两瓶酒都放在了橱柜上面。他叠起包酒瓶的手绢，小心翼翼地放进自己口袋里，拿起帽子，一副要告辞离开的样子。","Having held the first bottle up to the light, and shaken it well to test its excellence, Mr. Bumble placed them both on top of a chest of drawers; folded the handkerchief in which they had been wrapped; put it carefully in his pocket; and took up his hat, as if to go."
"“您走回去可是会很冷的，邦布尔先生。”女主管说。","“You’ll have a very cold walk, Mr. Bumble,” said the matron."
"“而且风也很大，太太。”邦布尔先生一边把大衣上的领子翻上去，一边回答道，“大得能吹掉人的耳朵。”","“It blows, ma’am,” replied Mr. Bumble, turning up his coat-collar, “enough to cut one’s ears off.”"
"女主管把目光从小茶壶移开，转到正往门边走去的教区执事身上；执事咳了一声，准备跟她道晚安。这时候，女主管羞怯地问他，想不想——想不想喝杯茶。","The matron looked, from the little kettle, to the beadle, who was moving towards the door; and as the beadle coughed, preparatory to bidding her good-night, bashfully inquired whether—whether he wouldn’t take a cup of tea?"
"邦布尔先生立刻重新翻下衣领，把帽子和手杖放到椅子上，然后又拉了一把走到桌边。他一边慢吞吞地坐下来，一边看着那位女士。她的目光则定在小茶壶上。邦布尔先生又咳了一声，露出一抹微笑。","Mr. Bumble instantaneously turned back his collar again; laid his hat and stick upon a chair; and drew another chair up to the table.As he slowly seated himself, he looked at the lady.She fixed her eyes upon the little teapot.Mr. Bumble coughed again, and slightly smiled."
"科尼太太站起身来，又从壁橱里取出一副杯碟。她坐回去的时候，眼神再一次与教区执事那殷勤的目光相遇了；她的脸腾地一下红了，只好埋下头来给他沏茶。邦布尔先生又咳了一声——这次比之前咳得更响了。","Mrs. Corney rose to get another cup and saucer from the closet.As she sat down, her eyes once again encountered those of the gallant beadle; she coloured, and applied herself to the task of making his tea.Again Mr. Bumble coughed—louder this time than he had coughed yet."
"“要加糖吗？邦布尔先生？”女主管拿起糖罐，问道。","“Sweet?Mr. Bumble?” inquired the matron, taking up the sugar-basin."
"“我喜欢甜蜜蜜的，真的，太太。”邦布尔先生说。他说这话的时候眼睛一直盯着科尼太太。如果说有表面上看不那么凶神恶煞的教区执事的话，那一刻的邦布尔先生就是实例。","“Very sweet, indeed, ma’am,” replied Mr. Bumble.He fixed his eyes on Mrs. Corney as he said this; and if ever a beadle looked tender, Mr. Bumble was that beadle at that moment."
"茶沏好了，她默默地给他递了过去。邦布尔先生首先在膝盖上铺了块手绢，以免面包屑弄脏他那光鲜的短裤，然后才开始用茶点。为了使这些娱乐富于变化，他还时不时地长叹一口气，不过这对他的食欲毫无影响，反倒似乎有助于他喝茶吃面包的进程。","The tea was made, and handed in silence.Mr. Bumble, having spread a handkerchief over his knees to prevent the crumbs from sullying the splendour of his shorts, began to eat and drink; varying these amusements, occasionally, by fetching a deep sigh; which, however, had no injurious effect upon his appetite, but, on the contrary, rather seemed to facilitate his operations in the tea and toast department."
"“我发现你养了一只猫，太太。”邦布尔先生说，扫了一眼屋子中间，那儿有只猫正趴在炉火前取暖，“我敢说还有小猫吧！”","“You have a cat, ma’am, I see,” said Mr. Bumble, glancing at one who, in the centre of her family, was basking before the fire; “and kittens too, I declare!”"
"“我可喜欢它们啦，邦布尔先生，你都想象不到。”女主管回答说，“它们是那么开心，那么快活，那么讨人喜欢，它们也算是我的伴了。”","“I am so fond of them, Mr. Bumble, you can’t think,” replied the matron.“They’re—so—happy,—so—frolicsome, and—so—cheerful, that they are quite companions for me.”"
"“很美好的动物啊，太太。”邦布尔先生赞许道，“那么驯良。”","“Very nice animals, ma’am,” replied Mr. Bumble, approvingly; “so very domestic.”"
"“喔，是啊！”女主管热情洋溢地回答说，“它们也很喜欢自己的家。我敢保证，住在这里也是一大乐趣。”","“Oh, yes!” rejoined the matron with enthusiasm; “so fond of their home too, that it’s quite a pleasure, I’m sure.”"
"“科尼太太，太太。”邦布尔先生一边搅着茶匙算时间，一边慢吞吞地说，“我是想说，太太，无论是大猫还是小猫崽，如果可以和您住在一起，太太，却不喜欢它的家，那它肯定是个蠢物，太太。”","“Mrs. Corney, ma’am,” said Mr. Bumble, slowly, and marking the time with his teaspoon, “I mean to say this, ma’am; that any cat, or kitten, that could live with you, ma’am, and-not-be fond of its home, must be a ass, ma’am.”"
"“喔，邦布尔先生！”科尼太太低嗔道。","“Oh, Mr. bumble!” remonstrated Mrs. Corney."
"“不用掩藏事实，太太。”邦布尔先生慢慢地挥动着茶匙，既多情又庄重，给人留下加倍深刻的印象，“我会很乐意亲自把它淹死。”","“It’s of no use disguising facts, ma’am,” said Mr. Bumble, slowly flourishing the teaspoon with a kind of amorous dignity which made him doubly impressive; “I would drown it myself, with pleasure.”"
"“那你就是个残酷的人了。”女主管爽朗地说，伸手去接教区执事的茶杯，“还是一个硬心肠的男人。”","“Then you’re a cruel man,” said the matron vivaciously, as she held out her hand for the beadle’s cup; “and a very hard-hearted man besides.”"
"“硬心肠吗，太太？”邦布尔先生说，“硬吗？”邦布尔先生放开了茶杯，没再说话。科尼太太接过茶杯时，他捏了捏她的小指，用手掌在他那带花边的背心上拍了两下，深深地叹了口气，然后把椅子向远离炉火的方向拉了一点。","“Hard-hearted, ma’am?” said Mr. Bumble.“Hard?”Mr. Bumble resigned his cup without another word; squeezed Mrs. Corney’s little finger as she took it; and inflicting two open-handed slaps upon his laced waistcoat, gave a mighty sigh, and hitched his chair a very little morsel farther from the fire."
"桌子是圆的，科尼太太和邦布尔先生一直相对而坐，前面又是炉火，两人之间空间不大。这样看来，邦布尔先生把椅子向远离炉火的方向退去，但仍坐在桌子旁，这样就拉长了他和科尼太太之间的距离。有些做事谨慎的读者无疑会对这个动作倍加崇拜，觉得这是邦布尔先生很有英雄气概的一个举动。他此时多少受到了时间、地点和机会的诱惑，要说些甜言蜜语。这种话尽管一般出自轻浮草率的人之口，但在大法官、议员、大臣、市长和其他为公众服务的伟大官员高贵姿态背后，似乎又的确大量存在着这些话，但这掩藏于一位教区执事后却尤为特殊。教区人员（众所周知）应该是所有这些人中最严肃、最顽固的一类人。","It was a round table; and as Mrs. Corney and Mr. Bumble had been sitting opposite each other, with no great space between them, and fronting the fire, it will be seen that Mr. Bumble, in receding from the fire, and still keeping at the table, increased the distance between himself and Mrs. Corney;which proceeding, some prudent readers will doubtless be disposed to admire, and to consider an act of great heroism on Mr. Bumble’s part:he being in some sort tempted by time, place, and opportunity, to give utterance to certain soft nothings, which however well they may become the lips of the light and thoughtless, do seem immeasurably beneath the dignity of judges of the land, members of parliament, ministers of state, lord mayors, and other great public functionaries, but more particularly beneath the stateliness and gravity of a beadle: who (as is well known) should be the sternest and most inflexible among them all."
"无论邦布尔先生意图为何，然而（无疑他的意图都是最好的），不幸的是发生了下面的事。前面已经两次提到，桌子是圆的；邦布尔先生一点一点地挪动椅子，不久之后，他和女主管之间的距离就开始缩短了。他还不停地沿着圆桌外延挪动椅子，他的椅子很快就和女主管的椅子贴得很近了。","Whatever were Mr. Bumble’s intentions, however (and no doubt they were of the best): it unfortunately happened, as has been twice before remarked, that the table was a round one; consequently Mr. Bumble, moving his chair by little and little, soon began to diminish the distance between himself and the matron;and, continuing to travel round the outer edge of the circle, brought his chair, in time, close to that in which the matron was seated."
"事实上，两把椅子都碰上了。直到这时，邦布尔先生才停了下来。","Indeed, the two chairs touched; and when they did so, Mr. Bumble stopped."
"此时此刻，如果女主管把椅子往右挪，她就会被火烫到；如果往左挪呢，她就会倒在邦布尔先生的怀里。因此（作为一位谨慎的女主管，她无疑一眼就预见到了这些后果）她就待在原本的位置，又递给邦布尔先生一杯茶。“硬心肠吗，科尼太太？”邦布尔先生一边说，一边搅动着他的茶，然后又抬眼看着女主管的脸，“你心肠硬么，科尼太太？”","Now, if the matron had moved her chair to the right, she would have been scorched by the fire; and if to the left, she must have fallen into Mr. Bumble’s arms; so (being a discreet matron, and no doubt foreseeing these consequences at a glance) she remained where she was, and handed Mr. Bumble another cup of tea.“Hard-hearted, Mrs. Corney?” said Mr. Bumble, stirring his tea, and looking up into the matron’s face; “are-you-hard-hearted, Mrs. Corney?”"
"“天哪！”女主管叫道，“一个单身男人问这个问题可真有趣。","“Dear me!” exclaimed the matron, “what a very curious question from a single man."
"教区执事喝干了最后一滴茶，吃完了一片面包，把面包屑从膝盖上抖落，擦了擦嘴唇，最后从容不迫地吻了吻女主管。","The beadle drank his tea to the last drop; finished a piece of toast; whisked the crumbs off his knees; wiped his lips; and deliberately kissed the matron."
"“邦布尔先生！”这位谨慎的女士低声喊道，她实在害怕得厉害，都说不出话了，“邦布尔先生，我要喊人了！”邦布尔先生没回答，只是缓慢而高贵地搂住了女主管的腰。女士陈述了她要叫出来的打算，面对这种得寸进尺的行为，她当然要喊。但这个时候，门外响起了一阵急促的敲门声，她做这个努力便没有必要了。邦布尔先生一听到敲门声，就敏捷地冲到葡萄酒瓶旁边，开始使劲地掸上面的灰尘，女主管则厉声询问来人的身份。","“Mr. Bumble!” cried that discreet lady in a whisper; for the fright was so great, that she had quite lost her voice, “Mr. Bumble, I shall scream!”Mr. Bumble made no reply; but in a slow and dignified manner, put his arm round the matron’s waist. As the lady had stated her intention of screaming, of course she would have screamed at this additional boldness, but that the exertion was rendered unnecessary by a hasty knocking at the door: which was no sooner heard, than Mr. Bumble darted, with much agility, to the wine bottles, and began dusting them with great violence: while the matron sharply demanded who was there. "
"值得一提的是，她的嗓音已经差不多恢复了原本严厉的官腔。这个实例很有趣，说明突如其来的惊吓有抵消极端恐惧的作用。","It is worthy of remark, as a curious physical instance of the efficacy of a sudden surprise in counteracting the effects of extreme fear, that her voice had quite recovered all its official asperity."
"“夫人，请您发发慈悲。”一个形貌丑陋、干瘪年老的女贫民从门边伸头进来，“老萨莉快要死了。”","“If you please, mistress,” said a withered old female pauper, hideously ugly: putting her head in at the door, “Old Sally is a-going fast.”"
"“哦，那关我什么事？”女主管生气地责问，“我也没法让她活下来，不是吗？”","“Well, what’s that to me?” angrily demanded the matron.“I can’t keep her alive, can I?”"
"“是没法，是没法，夫人。”老女人回答说，“没人能做到，她早就没救了。我看见过很多人在我面前死去，有小婴儿，也有强壮的大男人；我很清楚死神什么时候来。但是她心里有事放不下，她不发作的时候——这种情况很少见，她撑得很艰难——她说她有话要讲，必须讲给您听。夫人，您要是不来的话，她绝不会平静地死去的。”","“No, no, mistress,” replied the old woman, “nobody can; she’s far beyond the reach of help.I’ve  seen a many people die; little babes and great strong men; and I know when death’s a-coming, well enough.But she’s troubled in her mind: and when the fits are not on her,—and that’s not often, for she is dying very hard,—she says she has got something to tell, which you must hear.She’ll never die quiet till you come, mistress.”"
"一听这个消息，可敬的科尼太太就嘟嘟囔囔起来，痛骂那个死都非要打扰一下自己上司的老太婆。她迅速抓了一条厚实的披肩把自己裹上。她唯恐会发生什么特殊的事情，还简短地交代了邦布尔先生几句话，请他等她回来。科尼太太一边吩咐报信的走快一些，不要整个晚上在楼梯上磨蹭，一边跟着老太太走出了房间。她那优雅的风度几乎荡然无存，一路上都在骂骂咧咧的。","At this intelligence, the worthy Mrs. Corney muttered a variety of invectives against old women who couldn’t even die without purposely annoying their betters; and, muffling herself in a thick shawl which she hastily caught up, briefly requested Mr. Bumble to stay till she came back, lest anything particular should occur.Bidding the messenger walk fast, and not be all night hobbling up the stairs, she followed her from the room with a very ill grace, scolding all the way."
"邦布尔先生一个人留了下来，不过他之后的行为，却是相当令人费解。他打开壁橱，数了数里面茶匙的数量，掂了掂糖钳。为了确认一个牛奶壶的质地是真正的白银，对其仔细观察了一番。他满足了自己这些方面的好奇心以后，就把三角帽斜着戴上，围着桌子庄重地跳了四次舞，每次的舞步都不重样。","Mr. Bumble’s conduct on being left to himself, was rather inexplicable.He opened the closet, counted the teaspoons, weighed the sugar-tongs, closely inspected a silver milk-pot to ascertain that it was of the genuine metal, and, having satisfied his curiosity on these points, put on his cocked hat corner-wise, and danced with much gravity four distinct times round the table."
"完成了这项非凡的表演以后，他又摘下了帽子，背对着炉火伸展了一下手脚，似乎在脑子里列起了一张详细精确的家具清单。","Having gone through this very extraordinary performance, he took off the cocked hat again, and, spreading himself before the fire with his back towards it, seemed to be mentally engaged in taking an exact inventory of the furniture."
"第二十四章 本章讲述一个非常无聊的话题，本章篇幅很短，不过在这部传记中很可能意义重大","CHAPTER XXIV Treats on a very poor subject. But is a short one, and may be found of importance in this history."
"打破女主管房间静谧的人，倒是报丧的合适人选。她年纪大了，身体佝偻，四肢麻痹瘫软，颤抖个不止。她的脸歪了，嘴里咕咕哝哝地自语，眼神更是恶狠狠的；与其说这张脸是大自然巧手的产物，还不如说是某支信笔勾画出的怪物。","It was no unfit messenger of death, who had disturbed the quietness of the matron’s room.Her body was bent by age; her limbs trembled with palsy; her face, distorted into a mumbling leer, resembled more the grotesque shaping of some wild pencil, than the work of Nature’s hand."
"唉！出自造化之手的美好容颜，留下来不受碰触，能给我们欣赏的是多么稀少啊！世间的操劳、悲伤、饥饿可以改变心灵，同样也可以改变容颜。只有当那些激烈的情绪沉睡，永远失去其控制力时，烦恼之云才会飘远，留下晴朗的天堂之颜。死者的面容，即便已经固定、僵硬，也会逐渐柔化，成为那种人们早已忘记的表情，那种熟睡婴儿的表情。他们自此便一直保持这个生命伊始的特定表情，这种事很常见。死者的面容再一次变得如此平静、安详，以至于那些在无忧无虑的童年便认识他们的人会敬畏地跪倒在棺材旁边，甚至看到天使落于尘世。","Alas!How few of Nature’s faces are left alone to gladden us with their beauty!The cares, and sorrows, and hungerings, of the world, change them as they change hearts; and it is only when those passions sleep, and have lost their hold for ever, that the troubled clouds pass off, and leave Heaven’s surface clear.It is a common thing for the countenances of the dead, even in that fixed and rigid state, to subside into the long-forgotten expression of sleeping infancy, and settle into the very look of early life; so calm, so peaceful, do they grow again, that those who knew them in their happy childhood, kneel by the coffin’s side in awe, and see the Angel even upon earth."
"干瘪丑陋的老太婆蹒跚着穿过走廊，登上楼梯，嘴里含糊不清地回答着女总管的责难。最后她终于支持不住，只得停下来喘了喘气；她把灯递给了女总管，自己则跟在后面远远跟着。她的上司腿脚麻利些，径直走向了患病女人所在的房间。","The old crone tottered along the passages, and up the stairs, muttering some indistinct answers to the chidings of her companion; being at length compelled to pause for breath, she gave the light into her hand, and remained behind to follow as she might: while the more nimble superior made her way to the room where the sick woman lay."
"那是间空荡荡的阁楼，房间最近头点着一盏昏暗的灯。另外一个老太婆守在床头，教区药剂师的徒弟则站在炉火旁，正在把一支羽毛削成牙签。","It was a bare garret-room, with a dim light burning at the farther end.There was another old woman watching by the bed; the parish apothecary’s apprentice was standing by the fire, making a toothpick out of a quill."
"“晚上很冷啊，科尼太太。”女总管走进房间的时候，这位年轻的绅士说。","“Cold night, Mrs. Corney,” said this young gentleman, as the matron entered."
"“的确很冷，先生。”女主管用最礼貌的口吻回答，同时行了个屈膝礼。","“Very cold, indeed, sir,” replied the mistress, in her most civil tones, and dropping a curtsey as she spoke."
"“你们应该向承包商要点儿更好的煤。”药剂师副手说着，拿起锈迹斑斑的拔火棍敲碎了炉子顶端的一块煤，“这样的东西根本不能拿来对付寒冷的夜晚。”","“You should get better coals out of your contractors,” said the apothecary’s deputy, breaking a lump on the top of the fire with the rusty poker; “these are not at all the sort of thing for a cold night.”"
"“那是理事会选购的，先生。”女总管答道，“他们至少得保证我们过得暖和些，我们这些地方已经够艰苦了。”","“They’re the board’s choosing, sir,” returned the matron.“The least they could do, would be to keep us pretty warm: for our places are hard enough.”"
"这时生病的女人呻吟了一声，打断了他们的谈话。","The conversation was here interrupted by a moan from the sick woman."
"“哦！”年轻人朝床边转过脸去，似乎之前已经把病人的存在忘得差不多了，“没救了，科尼太太。”","“Oh!” said the young man, turning his face towards the bed, as if he had previously quite forgotten the patient, “it’s  all U.P.  there, Mrs. Corney.”"
"“快了，是吧，先生？”女总管问道。","“It is, is it, sir?” asked the matron."
"“她如果能再撑几个小时，我都会觉得吃惊。”见习药剂师说，他一门心思都放在那牙签尖上，“整个系统都崩溃了。她是在打盹吗，老太婆？”","“If she lasts a couple of hours, I shall be surprised,” said the apothecary’s apprentice, intent upon the toothpick’s point.“It’s a break-up of the system altogether.Is she dozing, old lady?”"
"看护在床边俯身确认了一下，肯定地点了点头。","The attendant stooped over the bed, to ascertain; and nodded in the affirmative."
"“只要你们不大吵大闹，她可能就这样过去了。”年轻人说，“把灯放在地板上。放那儿她就看不到了。”","“Then perhaps she’ll go off in that way, if you don’t make a row,” said the young man.“Put the light on the floor.She won’t see it there.”"
"看护按吩咐做了，不过她同时摇了摇头，暗示这个女人不会这么容易死去的。另一个看护此时也已经回来了，她便又坐回了同伴的旁边。女总管则是一脸不耐烦，她用披肩裹住自己，在床尾坐了下来。","The attendant did as she was told: shaking her head meanwhile, to intimate that the woman would not die so easily; having done so, she resumed her seat by the side of the other nurse, who had by this time returned.The mistress, with an expression of impatience, wrapped herself in her shawl, and sat at the foot of the bed."
"药剂师学徒削好牙签之后，站在火炉前面没挪开半步，足足剔了十来分钟的牙。很明显，他越等越无聊，在祝科尼太太工作愉快后，便轻手轻脚地离开了。","The apothecary’s apprentice, having completed the manufacture of the toothpick, planted himself in front of the fire and made good use of it for ten minutes or so: when apparently growing rather dull, he wished Mrs. Corney joy of her job, and took himself off on tiptoe."
"她们静静地坐了会儿。两个老太婆从床边站起来，蹲到了在炉火边，伸出皱巴巴的双手取暖。火苗在她们干瘪的脸上投下一团惨白的光，把她们的丑陋衬得分外可怖。就着这个姿势，她们开始低声交谈起来。","When they had sat in silence for some time, the two old women rose from the bed, and crouching over the fire, held out their withered hands to catch the heat.The flame threw a ghastly light on their shrivelled faces, and made their ugliness appear terrible, as, in this position, they began to converse in a low voice."
"“亲爱的安妮，我不在的时候，她又说什么了没有？”报丧的问道。","“Did she say any more, Anny dear, while I was gone?” inquired the messenger."
"“一个字都没说。”另一个答道，“有那么一小会儿她在自己胳膊上又拉又扯的，我抓住了她的双手，没过多久她就又睡着了。她身上没什么劲儿，我没花多少力气就让她安静了下来。尽管我是吃教区津贴的，但还不至于虚弱到对付不了一个老太婆，没错吧，没错吧！”","“Not a word,” replied the other.“She plucked and tore at her arms for a little time; but I held her hands, and she soon dropped off.She hasn’t much strength in her, so I easily kept her quiet.I ain’t so weak for an old woman, although I am on parish allowance; no, no!”"
"“医生让她喝热葡萄酒，她喝了没？”第一个看护问道。“我有试过让她喝下去。”另一个回答说，“但是她死咬着牙齿，手还死死抓着杯子。我使了吃奶的劲儿，也只是把那杯酒夺了回来。所以喽，我就把酒喝掉了，还真不错哩！”","“Did she drink the hot wine the doctor said she was to have?” demaned the first.“I tried to get it down,” rejoined the other.“But her teeth were tight set, and she clenched the mug so hard that it was as much as I could do to get it back again.So I drank it; and it did me good!”"
"这两个老丑婆谨慎地看了看四周，确信没有人听见她们的话之后，就又朝炉火凑了凑，还开怀地咯咯笑了起来。","Looking cautiously round, to ascertain that they were not overheard, the two hags cowered nearer to the fire, and chuckled heartily."
"“我心里有数。”第一个发话的说，“她还会来那一套，然后拿这件事大肆取笑一番。”","“I mind the time,” said the first speaker, “when she would have done the same, and made rare fun of it afterwards.”"
"“对啊，她真会那样。”另一个回答道，“她有颗快乐的心。”“她送出去许许多多美丽的尸体，个个漂亮整洁得像蜡像一样。我这双老眼看到过——是啊，这双老手也触碰过。我帮过她，都有好几十次啦。”","“Ay, that she would,” rejoined the other; “she had a merry heart.“A many, many, beautiful corpses she laid out, as nice and neat as waxwork.My old eyes have seen them—ay, and those old hands touched them too; for I have helped her, scores of times.”"
"这个老太婆一边说，一边哆哆嗦嗦地伸出几根手指，在自己面前得意洋洋地晃了晃。接着她又在口袋里乱摸一通，拿出一个已经褪了色的老旧锡鼻烟盒，从里面摇出几粒烟末放到同伴摊开的手掌里，又往自己手上倒了一些。女总管之前一直耐着性子，等着那临死的老妇人从昏迷中苏醒过来。这时正当这两人享用之际，她也来到炉火边加入了他们，并厉声询问究竟还要等多久。","Stretching forth her trembling fingers as she spoke, the old creature shook them exultingly before her face, and fumbling in her pocket, brought out an old time-discoloured tin snuff-box, from which she shook a few grains into the outstretched palm of her companion, and a few more into her own.While they were thus employed, the matron, who had been impatiently watching until the dying woman should awaken from her stupor, joined them by the fire, and sharply asked how long she was to wait?"
"“用不了多久，夫人。”第二个老太婆抬头看着她的脸，回答道，“我们都不愿等待死神到来。请耐心点，耐心点！死神很快就会来这里看我们大家的。”","“Not long,mistress, replied the second woman, looking up into her face.“We have none of us long to wait for Death.Patience, patience!He’ll be here soon enough for us all.”"
"“住嘴，你这个着了魔的白痴！”女总管严厉地说，“你，玛莎，告诉我，她以前有这样过吗？”","“Hold your tongue, you doting idiot!” said the matron sternly.“You, Martha, tell me; has she been in this way before?”"
"“她经常这样。”第一个老太婆答道。","“Often,” answered the first woman."
"“不过不会再这样了。”第二个补充道，“也就是说，她也只会再醒一次——留神了，夫人，那也长不了。”","“But will never be again,” added the second one; “that is, she’ll never wake again but once—and mind, mistress, that won’t be for long!”"
"“管它长短。”女总管暴躁地说，“她就算醒了也看不到我在这里。你们两个，当心着点儿，看你们敢再无缘无故来烦我。我的职责里头也不包括给这济贫院里面所有的老太婆送终，我以后也决不会——决不会这么做了。注意着点儿，你们这些放肆的老刁妇。你们要是再敢捉弄我，我很快就会修理你们，我保证！”","“Long or short,” said the matron, snappishly, “she won’t find me here when she does wake; take care, both of you, how you worry me again for nothing.it’s no part of my duty to see all the old women in the house die, and I won’t—that’s more.Mind that, you impudent old harridans.If you make a fool of me again, I’ll soon cure you, I warrant you!”"
"她正要大步离开，两个老太婆则转过身去，面朝着床。突然，她们一齐大叫起来，惹得她不禁又扭头看了一眼。病人已经自己直直地坐了起来，正朝着她们伸出胳膊。","She was bouncing away, when a cry from the two women, who had turned towards the bed, caused her to look round.The patient had raised herself upright, and was stretching her arms towards them."
"“谁在那边？”她用空洞的声音喊道。","“Who’s that?” she cried, in a hollow voice."
"“嘘，嘘！”其中一个妇人朝她弯下身去说，“躺下，躺下！”","“Hush, hush!” said one of the women, stooping over her.“Lie down, lie down!”"
"“我再躺下去时就已经不再是个活人了！”那个妇人挣扎着说，“我——要——告诉她！上这边来！靠近点儿！让我在你耳边悄悄告诉你。”","“I’ll never lie down again alive!” said the woman, struggling.“I—will—tell her!Come here!Nearer!Let me whisper in your ear.”"
"她抓住女总管的胳膊，把她摁进床边的一把椅子里。她没先开口说话，而是旁边扫了一眼，果然看到两个老太婆弯着腰，身体还往前倾，一副迫切想当听众的姿势。","She clutched the matron by the arm, and forcing her into a chair by the bedside, was about to speak, when looking round, she caught sight of the two old women bending forward in the attitude of eager listeners."
"“让她们走开，”妇人昏昏沉沉地说，“快点！快点！”","“Turn them away,” said the woman, drowsily; “make haste! make haste!”"
"这两个老太婆一齐开口，开始喋喋不休地哀怨悲叹，说这可怜的人儿病得厉害，连自己最好的朋友都不认识了，接着又郑重地做出各种保证，说她们绝对不会离她而去，一直到她们的上司把她们推出房间，关了门自己回到床边。被赶出去以后，两个老太婆变了语调，冲着钥匙眼嚷嚷，说老莎莉喝醉了。这根本不可能，因为除了药剂师开的适量的鸦片外，她最后只喝了一点掺水的杜松子酒，此时正备受煎熬。那还是两位可敬的老妇人出于好心，偷偷让她喝下去的。","The two old crones, chiming in together, began pouring out many piteous lamentations that the poor dear was too far gone to know her best friends; and were uttering sundry protestations that they would never leave her, when the superior pushed them from the room, closed the door, and returned to the bedside.On being excluded, the old ladies changed their tone, and cried through the keyhole that old Sally was drunk; which, indeed, was not unlikely; since, in addition to a moderate dose of opium prescribed by the apothecary, she was labouring under the effects of a final taste of gin-and-water which had been privily administered, in the openness of their hearts, by the worthy old ladies themselves."
"“现在听我说。”垂死的妇人大声说道，似乎在努力重燃一颗潜在的能量火花，“就在这个房间里——这张床上——我曾经照顾过一个年轻漂亮的人儿。她被带进来的时候，脚因为走的路太多，割伤严重，瘀痕累累；浑身上下都沾满了尘土和血迹。她生下了一个男孩，然后就死掉了。让我再想想——那是哪年来着！”","“Now listen to me,” said the dying woman aloud, as if making a great effort to revive one latent spark of energy.“In this very room—in this very bed—I once nursed a pretty young creetur, that was brought into the house with her feet cut and bruised with walking, and all soiled with dust and blood.She gave birth to a boy, and died.Let me think—what was the year again!”"
"“别管哪年了。”听她说话的那人很是不耐烦，“还有什么关于她的事吗？”","“Never mind the year,” said the impatient auditor; “what about her?”"
"“唉！”病人呢喃着，又像刚才那样昏昏沉沉起来，“关于她的吗？——关于——我想起来了！”她边叫边猛地跳起来，脸兴奋得通红，两只眼睛都凸出来——“我抢了她的东西，我抢了！她身体还没变凉——我告诉你，我抢的时候她的身体还没凉呢！”","“Ay,” murmured the sick woman, relapsing into her former drowsy state, “what about her?—what about—I know!” she cried, jumping fiercely up: her face flushed, and her eyes starting from her head—“I robbed her, so I did!She wasn’t cold—I tell you she wasn’t cold, when I stole it!”"
"“你抢了什么，看在上帝的份上？”女总管大声叫道，看样子似乎是要喊救命。","“Stole what, for God’s sake?” cried the matron, with a gesture as if she would call for help."
"“那个——！”妇人用手捂住对方的嘴，回答道，“是她仅有的东西。她需要衣服保暖，需要食物填肚子，可是她把那个东西藏在胸前，安全地留了下来。那可是金子做的！我告诉你。纯金，也许本可以救她一命的！”","“—It—!” replied the woman, laying her hand over the other’s mouth.“The only thing she had.She wanted clothes to keep her warm, and food to eat; but she had kept it safe, and had it in her bosom.It was gold, I tell you!Rich gold, that might have saved her life!”"
"“金子！”女总管也叫了一声。妇人随后倒了下去，她也急切地弯下身去，“说啊，说啊——对了——那东西是什么？那个母亲是谁？什么时候的事？”","“Gold!” echoed the matron, bending eagerly over the woman as she fell back.“Go on, go on—yes—what of it?Who was the mother?When was it?”"
"“她让我替她保管。”妇人呻吟了一声，回答说，“她委托给了我，因为我是当时在她身边唯一的女人。她第一次把挂在脖子上的那东西给我看时，我心里就已经决定要偷走它了。还有那个孩子的死，可能吧，也是我造成的！如果他们早知道所有这一切的话，肯定会对他好一些的。”","“She charge me to keep it safe,” replied the woman with a groan, “and trusted me as the only woman about her.I stole it in my heart when she first showed it me hanging round her neck; and the child’s death, perhaps, is on me besides!They would have treated him better, if they had known it all!”"
"“知道什么？”旁边人问道，“说啊！”","“Known what?” asked the other. “Speak!”"
"“那孩子长得像极了他妈妈。”妇人没注意到那问题，只是继续杂乱无章地讲下去，“我一看到他的脸，就忘不了那件事。可怜的姑娘！可怜的姑娘！她也才那么年轻！是多么温顺的小羊羔啊！等等，我还有更多的要说．我还没全告诉你，对吧？”","“The boy grew so like his mother,” said the woman, rambling on, and not heeding the question, “that I could never forget it when I saw his face.Poor girl!poor girl!She was so young, too!Such a gentle lamb!Wait; there’s more to tell.I have not told you all, have I?”"
"“没，没呢，”女总管一边答，一边侧过脑袋努力想听清她的话；这垂死妇人的说话声越来越微弱了，“快点讲，要不然就来不及了！”","“No, no,” replied the matron, inclining her head to catch the words, as they came more faintly from the dying woman.“Be quick, or it may be too late!”"
"“那个母亲，”妇人说，语气比之前更加吃力了，“那个母亲，当死亡的第一波痛苦来袭时，悄悄地对我说，如果她的孩子生下来是活着的，以后还发达了；可能有这么一天，他会听到别人提起他那可怜早逝的母亲，他不会觉得有多么不光彩的。”“然后，噢，仁慈的上帝啊！”她说着，两只瘦瘦的手合在一起，“不管是男孩还是女孩，请让这孩子在这个充满苦难的世界上结交几个好朋友；可怜可怜这个孤苦伶仃、只能依靠上帝保佑的孩子吧！”“那个男孩叫什么？”女主管追问道。","“The mother,” said the woman, making a more violent effort than before; “the mother, when the pains of death first came upon her, whispered in my ear that if her baby was born alive, and thrived, the day might come when it would not feel so much disgraced to hear its poor young mother named.“And oh, kind Heaven!” she said, folding her thin hands together, “whether it be boy or girl, raise up some friends for it in this troubled world, and take pity upon a lonely desolate child, abandoned to its mercy!” “The boy’s name?” demanded the matron."
"“他们——叫他——奥利弗。”妇人虚弱地回答，“我偷的金子——”“对，对——怎么样了？”另一个叫道。","“They—called—him Oliver,” replied the woman, feebly.“The gold I stole was—” “Yes, yes—what?” cried the other."
"她急切地在妇人身边弯下身，想听她的回答，但当妇人又一次缓慢而僵硬地坐起来时，她又本能地退了回去。妇人双手抓着被单，喉咙里咕嘟着发出几声含混不清的声响，然后倒回床上，死了。","She was bending eagerly over the woman to hear her reply; but drew back, instinctively, as she once again rose, slowly and stiffly, into a sitting posture; then, clutching the coverlid with both hands, muttered some indistinct sounds in her throat, and fell lifeless on the bed."
"“这下死彻底了吧！”门一开，两个老太婆就慌忙跑进来，其中一个叫道。","“Stone dead!” said one of the old women, hurrying in as soon as the door was opened."
"“直到最后，她也没说什么。”女主管应道，漫不经心地走开了。","“And nothing to tell, after all,” rejoined the matron, walking carelessly away."
"最后只留下这两个老丑婆。她们显然正为自己那可怕的职责做准备，忙得不可开交，也没顾得上回答，只是在尸体旁边徘徊犹豫着。","The two crones, to all appearance, too busily occupied in the preparations for their dreadful duties to make any reply, were left alone, hovering about the body."
"第二十五章 本章中，这部传记转而讲述费金先生和他的同伴","CHAPTER XXV Wherein this history reverts to Mr. Fagin and company"
"乡村济贫院发生这些事情的时候，费金先生正坐在他的老巢里——奥利弗就是从这个地方被那个女孩弄走的——在一团死气沉沉、烟雾缭绕的炉火边沉思。他膝盖上放着一对风箱，很明显他本来是想尝试用风箱把火烧得更旺些，但此时他已陷入了沉思。他将双臂交叉放在风箱上面，两根大拇指顶住下巴，双眼茫然地盯着锈迹斑斑的铁栅栏。","While these things were passing in the country workhouse, Mr. Fagin sat in the old den—the same from which Oliver had been removed by the girl—brooding over a dull, smoky fire.He held a pair of bellows upon his knee,　with which he had apparently been endeavouring to rouse it into more cheerful action; but he had fallen into deep thought; and with his arms folded on them, and his chin resting on his thumbs, fixed his eyes, abstractedly, on the rusty bars."
"他身后的桌子旁坐着机灵鬼、查尔斯·贝茨少爷和基特宁先生。他们都在专心致志地玩惠斯特扑克牌游戏，机灵鬼和哑巴对阵贝茨少爷和基特宁先生。首先提到姓名的那位绅士无论何时都是智慧非常。他细致观察这项游戏，专心研读基特宁先生的手，脸上又平添了许多额外的趣味。一有机会他就会不时这样或那样机敏地瞥一眼基特宁先生的手，并根据他看到的自己邻座手里的牌，巧妙地调整自己的玩法。那是一个寒冷的夜晚，机灵鬼戴着帽子；事实上，他在室内就是这幅样子，常常不摘帽子。他牙缝里还一直咬着一只陶烟斗，只会在感觉有必要拿起桌子上的一只酒壶，喝口酒提提神时，才会把烟管移开，留出极小的空间。这只酒壶的容量有一夸脱，里面盛着兑水杜松子酒，供大家一起享用。","At a table behind him sat the Artful Dodger, Master Charles Bates, and Mr. Chitling: all intent upon a game of whist; the Artful taking dummy against Master Bates and Mr. Chitling.The countenance of the first-named gentleman, peculiarly intelligent at all times, acquired great additional interest from his close observance of the game, and his attentive perusal of Mr. Chitling’s hand; upon which, from time to time, as occasion served, he bestowed a variety of earnest glances: wisely regulating his own play by the result of his observations upon his neighbour’s cards.It being a cold night, the Dodger wore his hat, as, indeed, was often his custom within doors.He also sustained a clay pipe between his teeth, which he only removed for a brief space when he deemed it necessary to apply for refreshment to a quart pot upon the table, which stood ready filled with gin-and-water for the accommodation of the company."
"贝茨少爷也全心玩牌，但比起他高技巧的同伴，他天生更易激动。看得出来，他喝兑水杜松子酒更频繁，玩笑开了不少，还老说些不相关的话，整个人都沉迷在了其中——这些都与这种三局两胜、讲究严谨的牌戏格格不入。事实上，机灵鬼仗着他们之间亲近的关系，不止一次借机严肃地劝告过他的同伴，这些举动并不恰当。所有这些劝说抱怨，贝茨少爷都极其礼貌地对待，只是要他的朋友“去死”，或把脑袋塞到麻袋里，或者回复几句类似的巧妙俏皮话。这些俏皮话运用得很有趣味，基特宁先生心里十分佩服。值得一提的是，后一位绅士和他的搭档一直在输牌。这种情形非但没有激怒贝茨少爷，反而好像给他带来了最好的消遣。每局结束他都要喧声大笑，并声称他平生从来没有见过这么有趣的游戏。","Master Bates was also attentive to the play; but being of a more excitable nature than his accomplished friend, it was observable that he more frequently applied himself to the gin-and-water, and moreover indulged in many jests and irrelevant remarks, all highly unbecoming a scientific rubber.Indeed, the Artful, presuming upon their close attachment, more than once took occasion to reason gravely with his companion upon these improprieties; all of which remonstrances, Master Bates received in extremely good part; merely requesting his friend to be “blowed,” or to insert his head in a sack, or replying with some other neatly-turned witticism of a similar kind, the happy application of which, excited considerable admiration in the mind of Mr. Chitling.It was remarkable that the latter gentleman and his partner invariably lost; and that the circumstance, so far from angering Master Bates, appeared to afford him the highest amusement, inasmuch as he laughed most uproariously at the end of every deal, and protested that he had never seen such a jolly game in all his born days."
"“再来两次双人对双人，就是一整局。”基特宁先生拉长了脸说，从背心口袋里掏出半个克朗，“我从来没见过像你这样的家伙，杰克，你每次都赢。甚至在我和查利有好牌的时候，我们都赢不了你。”","“That’s two doubles and the rub,” said Mr. Chitling, with a very long face, as he drew half-a-crown from his waistcoat-pocket.“I never see such a feller as you, Jack; you win everything.Even when we’ve  good cards, Charley and I can’t make nothing of ’em.”"
"查利·贝茨大为开心，不知道是被说话人本身还是他说话时垂头丧气的架势逗乐了，哈哈大笑起来。这笑声还在沉思中的犹太佬拉了回来，他便不禁询问是怎么一回事。","Either the master or the manner of this remark, which was made very ruefully, delighted Charley Bates so much, that his consequent shout of laughter roused the Jew from his reverie, and induced him to inquire what was the matter."
"“怎么一回事，费金！”查利喊道，“真希望你看了牌局。汤米·基特宁一分都没赢，我和他搭档对付机灵鬼和哑巴。”","“Matter, Fagin!” cried Charley.“I wish you had watched the play.Tommy Chitling hasn’t won a point; and I went partners with him against the Artfull and dumb.”"
"“是啊，是啊！”犹太佬咧嘴笑着说，充分说明他完全了解其中的缘由，“再玩几把，汤姆，再玩几把。”","“Ay, ay!” said the Jew, with a grin, which sufficiently demonstrated that he was at no loss to understand the reason.“Try ’em again, Tom; try ’em again.”"
"“我可不玩了，多谢了，费金，”基特宁先生回答道，“我受够了。机灵鬼一路走运，谁都赢不了他。”","“No more of it for me, thank ’ee, Fagin,” replied Mr. Chitling; “I’ve  had enough.That ’ere Dodger has such a run of luck that there’s no standing again’ him.”"
"“哈！哈！亲爱的，”犹太佬答道，“你要想赢机灵鬼，早上可得起个大早。”","“Ha! ha! my dear,” replied the Jew, “you must get up very early in the morning, to win against the Dodger.”"
"“早上！”查利·贝茨说，“要是想赢他，半夜就得把靴子穿上，给两只眼睛各戴一台望远镜，肩膀中间还得挂一个看戏用的眼镜。”","“Morning!” said Charley Bates; “you must put your boots on over-night, and have a telescope at each eye, and a opera-glass between your shoulders, if you want to come over him.”"
"道金斯先生镇定自若地接受了这些溢美之词，并提出要和在座随便哪位绅士玩切牌，先切到人头者为胜，一次一个先令。没有人接受这一挑战，而他的烟斗这时又刚好抽完。他便继续自娱自乐，用代替筹码的那段粉笔在桌子上画了一幅新门监狱的平面图，一边画还一边吹着格外刺耳的口哨。","Mr. Dawkins received these handsome compliments with much philosophy, and offered to cut any gentleman in company, for the first picture-card, at a shilling at a time.Nobody accepting the challenge, and his pipe being by this time smoked out, he proceeded to amuse himself by sketching a ground-plan of Newgate on the table with the piece of chalk which had served him in lieu of counters; whistling, meantime, with peculiar shrillness."
"“你可真够无聊的，汤米！”众人很长一段时间都一言不发；机灵鬼打破沉默，开口就提到了基特宁先生，“你觉得他在想什么呢，费金？”","“How precious dull you are, Tommy!” said the Dodger, stopping short when there had been a long silence; and addressing Mr. Chitling.“What do you think he’s thinking of, Fagin?”"
"“这我怎么可能知道啊，亲爱的？”犹太佬说着，回头看了一眼，手里还拉着风箱，“大概在想他输了多少吧；要不就是他刚离开的那个村子，那里头有个幽静住处，对吧？哈！哈！是不是啊，亲爱的？”","“How should I know, my dear?” replied the Jew, looking round as he plied the bellows.“About his losses, maybe; or the little retirement in the country that he’s just left, eh?Ha! ha!Is that it, my dear?”"
"“压根不是那么回事。”基特宁先生刚要开口，机灵鬼已经抢先回答，刹住了这个话题。“你——怎——么——看呢，查利？”","“Not a bit of it,” replied the Dodger, stopping the subject of discourse as Mr. Chitling was about to reply.“What do-you-say, Charley?”"
"“让我——说——”贝茨少爷咧嘴笑了，“他对贝齐可不是一般的甜。看他脸红的！噢，我的眼睛啊！眼前简直有个旋转木马在转，这下有乐子看了！汤米·基特宁得相思病了！噢，费金！费金！我要发狂了！”","“—I—should say,” replied Master Bates, with a grin, “that he was uncommon sweet upon Betsy.See how he’s a-blushing!Oh, my eye! here’s a merry-go-rounder!Tommy Chitling’s in love!Oh, Fagin, Fagin!what a spree!”"
"想到基特宁先生竟然成了爱情这一柔美情感的受害者，贝茨少爷完全乐疯了。他猛地朝他坐的椅子仰过去，失去了平衡，一头栽倒在了地板上（这事故丝毫没影响到他的快活劲）。他摊开手脚躺在地板上，一直到笑完了，才坐回原来的位置，接着又开始另一轮大笑。","Thoroughly overpowered with the notion of Mr. Chitling being the victim of the tender passion, Master Bates threw himself back in his chair with such violence, that he lost his balance, and pitched over upon the floor; where (the accident abating nothing of his merriment) he lay at full length until his laugh was over, when he resumed his former position, and began another laugh. "
"“别理他，亲爱的，”犹太佬说，朝道金斯先生挤了挤眼，还用风箱的喷嘴敲了贝茨少爷一下以示惩戒，“贝齐是个好姑娘。你只管追，汤姆。你只管追。”","“Never mind him, my dear,” said the Jew, winking at Mr. Dawkins, and giving Master Bates a reproving tap with the nozzle of the bellows.“Betsy’s a fine girl.Stick up to her, Tom.Stick up to her.”"
"“我想说的是，费金，”基特宁先生回答，脸红得很，“说的是，这事与你们这里的任何人都没关系。”","“What I mean to say, Fagin,” replied Mr. Chitling, very red in the face, “is, that that isn’t anything to anybody here.”"
"“不会再有人多说什么了。”犹太佬答道，“查利就会闲碎嘴。你别理他，亲爱的，别理他。贝齐是个好姑娘。照她吩咐的做，汤姆，你会走运的。”","“No more it is,” replied the Jew; “Charley will talk.Don’t mind him, my dear; don’t mind him.Betsy’s a fine girl.Do as she bids you, Tom, and you will make your fortune.”"
"“我就是完全照她的吩咐做事的。”基特宁答道，“要不是听了她的建议，我也不会受折腾了。但到头来还不是让你占了好处，不是吗，费金！六个礼拜算什么？反正总是要进去的，不论是在什么时候。那么干嘛不选在冬天，正好那时你也不怎么想出去走动，嗯，费金？”","“So I-do-do as she bids me,” replied Mr. Chitling; “I shouldn’t have been milled, if it hadn’t been for her advice.But it turned out a good job for you; didn’t it, Fagin!And what’six weeks of it?It must come, some time or another, and why not in the winter time when you don’t want to go out a-walking so much; eh, Fagin?”"
"“啊，当然了，亲爱的。”犹太佬回答。","“Ah, to be sure, my dear,” replied the Jew."
"“你不介意再进去一次的，汤姆，对吧？”机灵鬼朝查利和犹太佬挤了挤眼，“如果贝齐不在乎的话？”","“You wouldn’t mind it again, Tom, would you,” asked the Dodger, winking upon Charley and the Jew, “if Bet was all right?”"
"“我想说，我应该不会介意。”汤姆生气地说，“再进去那里，现在。啊！谁要是敢再说这些，我倒想知道知道，嗯，费金？”","“I mean to say that I shouldn’t,” replied Tom, angrily.“There, now.Ah!Who’ll say as much as that, I should like to know; eh, Fagin?”"
"“没人敢，亲爱的，”犹太佬答道，“根本没人敢，汤姆。我知道除了你，他们中没一个人有这种胆色，一个都没有，亲爱的。”","“Nobody, my dear,” replied the Jew; “not a soul, Tom.I don’t know one of ’em that would do it besides you; not one of ’em, my dear.”"
"“当初我要是把她供出来，自个儿就没事了，对不对，费金？”可怜的冤大头生气地追问道，“我一句话就能搞定，不是吗，费金？”","“I might have got clear off, if I’d split upon her; mightn’t I, Fagin?” angrily pursued the poor half-witted dupe.“A word from me would have done it; wouldn’t it, Fagin?”"
"“肯定可以，亲爱的。”犹太佬回答说。","“To be sure it would, my dear,” replied the Jew."
"“但我什么都没漏出来，是吧，费金？”汤姆又追问道。他的问题一个接着一个，不带丝毫停顿。","“But I didn’t blab it; did I, Fagin?” demanded Tom, pouring question upon question with great volubility."
"“没有，没有，绝对的，”犹太佬回答说，“在这件事上，你就是有点儿太鲁莽了。太鲁莽了，亲爱的！”","“No, no, to be sure,” replied the Jew; “you were too stout-hearted for that.A deal too stout, my dear!”"
"“可能是吧，”汤姆看了看四周，回答说，“可就算是这样，那这里面又有什么好笑的呢，啊，费金？”","“Perhaps I was,” rejoined Tom, looking round; “and if I was, what’s to laugh at, in that; eh, Fagin?”"
"犹太佬感觉到基特宁先生此时火冒三丈，赶忙向他保证没人在笑。为了证明在场的人都很庄重，他求助于始作俑者贝茨少爷。但是不幸的是，查利刚张开嘴，想要回答说自己这辈子从来没有比现在更严肃过，却又忍不住哈哈大笑起来。受侮辱的基特宁先生没给任何预兆，一下子就横冲过房间，朝着冒犯者就想给他一拳。贝茨少爷对躲避追击向来就很有技巧，一躬身躲过了这一拳；他选的时机又如此巧妙，这拳打到了那乐呵呵的老绅士胸上，打得他踉踉跄跄，一直退到墙边，站在那里大口喘着气。基特宁先生看着他，满脸错愕的表情。“听！”这时机灵鬼叫道，“我听到铃声了。”他一把抓起蜡烛，轻轻地爬上了楼。","The Jew, perceiving that Mr. Chitling was considerably roused, hastened to assure him that nobody was laughing; and to prove the gravity of the company, appealed to Master Bates, the principal offender.But, unfortunately, Charley, in opening his mouth to reply that he was never more serious in his life, was unable to prevent the escape of such a violent roar, that the abused Mr. Chitling, without any preliminary ceremonies, rushed across the room and aimed a blow at the offender;who, being skilful in evading pursuit, ducked to avoid it, and chose his time so well that it lighted on the chest of the merry old gentleman, and caused him to stagger to the wall, where he stood panting for breath, while Mr. Chitling looked on in intense dismay.“Hark!” cried the Dodger at this moment, “I heard the tinkler.”Catching up the light, he crept softly upstairs."
"这帮人顿时身处一片黑暗之中，这时铃声又不耐烦地响了起来。过了一小会儿，机灵鬼回来了，神神秘秘地跟费金咬耳朵。","The bell was rung again, with some impatience, while the party were in darkness.After a short pause, the Dodger reappeared, and whispered Fagin mysteriously."
"“什么！”犹太佬叫道，“就一个人？”","“What!” cried the Jew, “alone?”"
"机灵鬼肯定地点了点头。他用手遮住了蜡烛的火光，悄悄地给查利·贝茨做了个手势，暗示他此刻最好别开玩笑。尽完了好朋友的责任，他注视着犹太佬的脸，等着他的指示。","The Dodger nodded in the affirmative, and, shading the flame of the candle with his hand, gave Charley Bates a private intimation, in dumb show, that he had better not be funny just then.Having performed this friendly office, he fixed his eyes on the Jew’s face, and awaited his directions."
"老头咬着他泛黄的手指，思考了几秒钟。这时他的脸上满是焦虑的神情，似乎正担心着什么，又害怕得知最坏的情况。终于，他抬起了头。","The old man bit his yellow fingers, and meditated for some seconds; his face working with agitation the while, as if he dreaded something, and feared to know the worst. At length he raised his head."
"“他在哪儿？”他问道。","“Where is he?” he asked."
"机灵鬼指了指楼上，做了个手势，意思好像是说，他要再离开房间一趟。","The Dodger pointed to the floor above, and made a gesture, as if to leave the room."
"“好的，”犹太佬回复了这个无声的请求，“带他下来。嘘！安静点儿，查利！轻点儿，汤姆！避开点儿，避开点儿！”","“Yes,” said the Jew, answering the mute inquiry; “bring him down.Hush!Quiet, Charley!Gently, Tom!Scarce, scarce!”"
"查利·贝茨和他新近结下的对头立即服从了这一简短的指示，轻手轻脚地避开了。房间里没了声音，不知道他们都去了哪里。这时，机灵鬼拿着蜡烛走下楼梯，后面跟着一个穿粗布长罩衫的男人。他慌忙扫视了一下房间，然后才扯下了遮挡他下半张脸的大披巾，露出来一张憔悴无比，不知多久没洗过也没刮过的脸——这正是花花公子托比·格拉基特的特色。","This brief direction to Charley Bates, and his recent antagonist, was softly and immediately obeyed.There was no sound of their whereabout, when the Dodger descended the stairs, bearing the light in his hand, and followed by a man in a coarse smock-frock; who, after casting a hurried glance round the room, pulled off a large wrapper which had concealed the lower portion of his face, and disclosed: all haggard, unwashed, and unshorn: the features of flash Toby Crackit. "
"“你好吗，费金？”这位可敬人士说着，朝犹太佬点点头，“快把这条围巾塞到我的皮帽里去，机灵鬼，这样我要剪头发的时候就知道到哪里去找它了。这就对了！你将来肯定会变成一个年轻有为的江洋大盗，比眼前这个老油条还要高明。”","“How are you, Faguey?” said this worthy, nodding to the Jew.“Pop that shawl away in my castor, Dodger, so that I may know where to find it when I cut; that’s the time of day!You’ll be a fine young cracksman afore the old file now.”"
"他边说边撩起了那粗布罩衫缠在腰间，又拉了把椅子坐到炉火边，把两只脚搭在了炉架上，","With these words he pulled up the smock-frock; and, winding it round his middle, drew a chair to the fire, and placed his feet upon the hob."
"“看看那儿，费金，”他说着，郁郁不欢地指着他的长筒马靴，“从你知道这双靴时起，连一滴戴伊马丁都没沾过，都没擦过一点黑鞋油末，天哪！但别那么看我，伙计。别着急。我没吃没喝的没法谈生意。拿点吃的来，先让我安安静静地填一填饿了三天的肚子！”","“See there, Faguey,” he said, pointing disconsolately to his top boots; “not a drop of Day and Martin since you know when; not a bubble of blacking, by Jove!But don’t look at me in that way, man.All in good time.I can’t talk about business till I’ve  eat and drank; so produce the sustainance, and let’s have a quiet fill-out for the first time these three days!”"
"犹太佬朝机灵鬼做了个手势，让他把能吃的都拿到桌子上去；他自己则坐在这个强盗的对面，等着他闲下来。","The Jew motioned to the Dodger to place what eatables there were, upon the table; and, seating himself opposite the housebreaker, waited his leisure."
"从他的表现来看，托比一点都不着急，并不想立即开始谈话。刚开始的时候，犹太佬耐心地看着他的脸聊以自慰，似乎要从他的表情中得到些他所带来的情报的线索，但却是白费力气。","To judge from appearances, Toby was by no means in a hurry to open the conversation.At first, the Jew contented himself with patiently watching his countenance, as if to gain from its expression some clue to the intelligence he brought; but in vain."
"他看上去特别疲惫，但是一如既往地面带闲适自满的神情；那表情透过污垢尘土、乱糟糟的胡须，依然闪耀惹眼，无所减弱——这就是花花公子托比·格拉基特自满得意的笑容。可接下来，犹太佬眼看他一小口一小口地把食物放进嘴里，实在是焦躁不已，痛苦不堪；他抑制不住激动，在屋里踱来踱去。这些都没用。托比继续吃着，对外界表现得漠不关心，直到他再也吃不下去为止。他让机灵鬼出去，自己关上了门，调了杯酒，又缓了缓神，这才准备开口说话。","He looked tired and worn, but there was the same complacent repose upon his features that they always wore: and through dirt, and beard, and whisker, there still shone, unimpaired, the self-satisfied smirk of flash Toby Crackit.Then the Jew, in an agony of impatience, watched every morsel he put into his mouth; pacing up and down the room, meanwhile, in irrepressible excitement.It was all of no use.Toby continued to eat with the utmost outward indifference, until he could eat no more; then, ordering the Dodger out, he closed the door, mixed a glass of spirits and water, and composed himself for talking."
"“首要的是，费金。”托比说道。","“First and foremost, Faguey,” said Toby."
"“是，是！”犹太佬一边插嘴，一边把椅子往前拉了拉。","“Yes, yes!” interposed the Jew, drawing up his chair."
"格拉基特先生停下来喝了一口酒，赞了一声松子酒非常好喝。接着他又把脚蹬在矮壁炉上，使得靴子和眼睛的高度大致齐平，这才又平平静静地重拾话题。","Mr. Crackit stopped to take a draught of spirits and water, and to declare that the gin was excellent; then placing his feet against the low mantelpiece, so as to bring his boots to about the level of his eye, he quietly resumed."
"“首要的是，费金，”强盗说道，“比尔还好吗？”","“First and foremost, Faguey,” said the housebreaker, “how’s Bill?”"
"“什么！”犹太佬一下从椅子上跳了起来，大声叫道。","“What!” screamed the Jew, starting from his seat."
"“什么，你不是要说——”托比又开口了，脸色煞白。","“Why, you don’t mean to say—” began Toby, turning pale."
"“就是这意思！”犹太佬喊道，怒不可遏地跺着地面，“他们在哪儿？赛克斯和那个男孩！他们在哪儿了？他们去哪儿了？他们躲在哪儿了？他们为什么还没来？”","“Mean!” cried the Jew, stamping furiously on the ground.“Where are they?Sikes and the boy!Where are they?Where have they been?Where are they hiding?Why have they not been here?”"
"“买卖搞砸了。”托比有气无力地说。","“The crack failed,” said Toby faintly."
"“我知道。”犹太佬从口袋里扯出一张报纸，指着报纸回答说，“还有呢？”","“I know it,” replied the Jew, tearing a newspaper from his pocket and pointing to it.“What more?”"
"“他们开枪打中了那男孩。我们俩架着他抄近路穿过了房子后面的田野——跑得直直的，像乌鸦飞过一样——穿过了篱笆和水渠。他们还追着我们。该死！整个村子都醒了，狗也在追我们。”","“They fired and hit the boy.We cut over the fields at the back, with him between us—straight as the crow flies—through hedge and ditch.They gave chase.Damme! the whole country was awake, and the dogs upon us.”"
"“那孩子！”","“The boy!”"
"“比尔把他被在背上，像风似的飞跑。后来我们停了下来，想两个人一起架住他，但他的头耷拉下来，身体已经凉了。他们紧紧地跟在我们后面，都快踩到我们的脚后跟了；人人为己，谁都不想上绞刑架！我们就散开跑了，留那孩子躺在一条水渠里。他生死不明，这是我知道的所有关于他的事了。”","“Bill had him on his back, and scudded like the wind.We stopped to take him between us; his head hung down, and he was cold.They were close upon our heels; every man for himself, and each from the gallows!We parted company, and left the youngster lying in a ditch.Alive or dead, that’s all I know about him.”"
"犹太佬没再听他说下去，只是大喊一声，双手揪着头发，冲出了房间，一路跑出了房子。","The Jew stopped to hear no more; but uttering a loud yell, and twining his hands in his hair, rushed from the room, and from the house."
"第二十六章 在这一章里，一个神秘的角色登场了，许多与本传记密切相关的事情也发生了","CHAPTER XXVI In which a mysterious character appears upon the scene; and many things, inseparable from this history, are done and performed "
"老费金一直跑到街角，才开始接受托比·格拉基特带来的消息，才开始从这消息造成的影响中缓过神来。他依旧疯狂混乱地向前跑着，一点也没放慢自己不寻常的速度。突然一辆马车从他身旁飞速驶过，差一点就撞到了他；行人见此情形都尖叫了起来，他这才回到了人行道上。他尽量避开了所有的大道，光挑些小街小巷躲躲闪闪地穿过。最后，他终于到了斯诺山。到了这里后，他走得比之前更快了。他毫不拖沓往前走，直到又一闪身进了一个小巷子。这时他才好像意识到已经到了属于自己的地方，于是他恢复了平日里那种慢腾腾的步子，连呼吸看上去也更加畅快了。","The old man had gained the street corner, before he began to recover the effect of Toby Crackit’s s intelligence.He had relaxed nothing of his unusual speed; but was still pressing onward, in the same wild and disordered manner, when the sudden dashing past of a carriage: and a boisterous cry from the foot passengers, who saw his danger: drove him back upon the pavement.Avoiding, as much as was possible, all the main streets, and skulking only through the by-ways and alleys, he at length emerged on Snow Hill.Here he walked even faster than before; nor did he linger until he had again turned into a court; when, as if conscious that he was now in his proper element, he fell into his usual shuffling pace, and seemed to breathe more freely."
"在斯诺山与霍尔本山的交会处附近，沿着从伦敦城出来右手边方向，有一条狭窄昏暗的巷子，通向红花山。巷子里有一些肮脏的店铺，摆着大束大束二手丝织手绢，大小不一、样式齐全，因为这里居住着不少从小偷的手里收购这些货的商人。成百上千条手绢挂在窗户外面的钉子上，晃来晃去，或者是在门柱上迎风飘扬；里面的货架上也都堆满了手绢。尽管这里跟菲尔德胡同一样狭窄，但是这条小巷有自己的理发店、咖啡馆、酒吧和卖煎鱼的货栈。这里自成一个商业聚居地，是小偷小摸者的贸易中心。从晨光熹微到夜幕降临，沉默的商人络绎不绝地来到这里。他们在黑暗的后厢房里做地下交易，来去无踪，神秘莫测。在这里，裁缝、补鞋匠、收破烂的人都把他们的货物摆放出来，作为告知小偷的广告牌。在这里，肮脏的地窖里堆积着废旧铁器、骨头制品乃至成堆成堆的已经发霉的毛麻织品碎片，都在那里生锈腐烂着。","Near to the spot on which Snow Hill and Holborn Hill meet, opens, upon the right hand as you come out of the City, a narrow and dismal alley, leading to Saffron Hill.In its filthy shops are exposed for sale huge bunches of second-hand silk handkerchiefs, of all sizes and patterns; for here reside the traders who purchase them from pick-pockets.Hundreds of these handkerchiefs hang dangling from pegs outside the windows or flaunting from the door-posts; and the shelves, within, are piled with them.Confined as the limits of Field Lane are, it has its barber, its coffee-shop, its beer-shop, and its fried-fish warehouse.It is a commercial colony of itself: the emporium of petty larceny: visited at early morning, and setting-in of dusk, by silent merchants, who traffic in dark back-parlours, and who go as strangely as they come.Here, the clothesman, the shoe-vamper, and the rag-merchant, display their goods, as sign-boards to the petty thief; here, stores of old iron and bones, and heaps of mildewy fragments of woollen-stuff and linen, rust and rot in the grimy cellars."
"犹太佬就是转进了这么一个地方。巷子里的这些面黄肌瘦的居民都认识他。他走过去的时候，那些正在店铺门口做生意的人都亲切地跟他点头打招呼。他也向他们点头示意，但是并无进一步交流。他径直走到巷子的尽头才停下来，跟一个矮个子的店家打了个招呼。那个人满满当当地挤在一把儿童椅里，正坐在店门口抽着烟斗。","It was into this place that the Jew turned.He was well known to the sallow denizens of the lane; for such of them as were on the look-out to buy or sell, nodded, familiarly, as he passed along.He replied to their salutations in the same way; but bestowed no closer recognition until he reached the further end of the alley; when he stopped, to address a salesman of small stature, who had squeezed as much of his person into a child’s chair as the chair would hold, and was smoking a pipe at his warehouse door."
"“哎呀，费金，只要一看到你，就连瞎子也能睁开眼了。”这位值得尊重的商人说，对犹太佬询问他的身体状况表示感谢。","“Why, the sight of you, Mr. Fagin, would cure the hoptalmy!” said this respectable trader, in acknowledgment of the Jew’s inquiry after his health."
"“莱夫利，这一带真是有点热啊。”费金说着扬起眉毛，双手交叉着放在肩膀上。","“The neighbourhood was a little too hot, Lively,” said Fagin, elevating his eyebrows, and crossing his hands upon his shoulders."
"“是啊，我不止一次听过这种抱怨了。”商人回答，“不过很快就会冷下来了，你没发现天气就是这样一回事吗？”","“Well, I’ve  heerd that complaint of it, once or twice before,” replied the trader; “but it soon cools down again; don’t you find it so?”"
"费金同意地点点头。他指着红花山的方向，问今晚有没有人去了那里。","Fagin nodded in the affirmative.Pointing in the direction of Saffron Hill, he inquired whether any one was up yonder to-night."
"“你说的是瘸子酒馆吗？”商人问道。犹太佬点点头。","“At the Cripples?” inquired the man.The Jew nodded."
"“让我想想，”那个商人沉思了一会儿，接着说，","“Let me see,” pursued the merchant, reflecting."
"“有，大约是有六七个人去了那里，这我知道。不过我觉得你的朋友不在那儿。”","“Yes, there’s some half-dozen of ’em gone in, that I knows.I don’t think your friend’s there.”"
"“赛克斯不在，对吗？”费金询问道，满脸失望。","“Sikes is not, I suppose?” inquired the Jew, with a disappointed countenance."
"“用律师的说法，他不在场。”小个子摇着头用拉丁语回答道，看上去极为狡猾，“今晚你有什么货给我吗？”","“—Non istwentus—, as the lawyers say,” replied the little man, shaking his head, and looking amazingly sly. “Have you got anything in my line to-night?”"
"“今晚没有。”费金说着，转身离开了。","“Nothing to-night,” said the Jew, turning away."
"“费金，你要去瘸子酒馆吗？”小个子在后面喊他，“等等，我不介意陪你去那喝上两杯！”","“Are you going up to the Cripples, Fagin?” cried the little man, calling after him. “Stop! I don’t mind if I have a drop there with you!”"
"不过费金回头看了看，摆了摆手，示意自己更喜欢一个人过去，况且那个小个子要从那张椅子里挣脱出来可不是一件容易事。看来这一次，瘸子酒店这块招牌也就失去了莱夫利先生光顾的荣幸了。等莱夫利先生好不容易站起来时，费金早就消失得无影无踪了。他只好踮着脚尖，希望能够看到费金的背影，可却是徒劳无获。于是他再次把身子挤进那把小椅子里，跟对面店铺里的一位太太交换了一个摇头的动作，里头明显掺杂着怀疑与不信任，然后又一本正经地叼起了烟斗。","But as the Jew, looking back, waved his hand to intimate that he preferred being alone; and, moreover, as the little man could not very easily disengage himself from the chair; the sign of the Cripples was, for a time, bereft of the advantage of Mr. Lively’s presence.By the time he had got upon his legs, the Jew had disappeared; so Mr. Lively, after ineffectually standing on tiptoe, in the hope of catching sight of him, again forced himself into the little chair, and, exchanging a shake of the head with a lady in the opposite shop, in which doubt and mistrust were plainly mingled, resumed his pipe with a grave demeanour."
"三瘸子，也叫瘸子，是一家酒馆的招牌，它的老顾客都习惯叫它瘸子酒馆。赛克斯先生和他的狗之前曾在这家店里出现过。费金跟酒馆吧台里的一个人打了个招呼，就径直走上了楼，打开了一扇房门，悄悄地溜了进去。他用手挡住眼睛，朝四下里不安地看了看，似乎是在寻找什么人。","The Three Cripples, or rather the Cripples; which was the sign by which the establishment was familiarly known to its patrons: was the public-house in which Mr. Sikes and his dog have already figured.Merely making a sign to a man at the bar, Fagin walked straight upstairs, and opening the door of a room, and softly insinuating himself into the chamber, looked anxiously about: shading his eyes with his hand, as if in search of some particular person."
"房间里点着两盏煤油灯，窗板加了栅栏，褪色的红色窗帘拉得严严实实，一点也不透光。天花板被涂成了黑色，如果使用其他颜色，也免不了被烛火熏黑。整个房间里弥漫着烟草燃烧的浓烟，刚进去时，几乎不可能辨别出除烟以外的任何东西。不过慢慢地，有些烟雾从打开的门中散了出去，只见屋子里很多脑袋挤成一片，就跟涌入耳朵的嘈杂声一样混乱。随着眼睛逐渐适应了环境，观察者慢慢地意识到房间里人数众多，有男有女，都围在一张长桌旁。在桌子首座那一头坐着一位手拿审判小锤的主席；一位鼻子发青的专业人士正坐在偏僻的角落里叮叮咚咚地捣鼓钢琴；拜牙疼所赐，他的脸被包了起来。","The room was illuminated by two gas-lights; the glare of which was prevented by the barred shutters, and closely-drawn curtains of faded red, from being visible outside.The ceiling was blackened, to prevent its colour from being injured by the flaring of the lamps; and the place was so full of dense tobacco smoke, that at first it was scarcely possible to discern anything more.By degrees, however, as some of it cleared away through the open door, an assemblage of heads, as confused as the noises that greeted the ear, might be made out; and as the eye grew more accustomed to the scene, the spectator gradually became aware of the presence of a numerous company, male and female, crowded round a long table:at the upper end of which, sat a chairman with a hammer of office in his hand; while a professional gentleman with a bluish nose, and his face tied up for the benefit of a toothache, presided at a jingling piano in a remote corner."
"费金轻轻走进来时，那位专业人士正以弹奏序曲的方式用手指滑过琴键，引得大家纷纷喊着要求点歌一曲。嘈杂平息之后，一位年轻女士上前为大家献上一首四段式歌谣。她每唱完一段，伴奏的人都要把这支曲子从头到尾弹上一遍。他使出了吃奶的力气，琴声震耳欲聋。唱完后，主席发表了一番感想。坐在主席两侧的两位专业人士随后又主动为大家献上一首二重唱，博得大家阵阵掌声。","As Fagin stepped softly in, the professional gentleman, running over the keys by way of prelude, occasioned a general cry of order for a song; which having subsided, a young lady proceeded to entertain the company with a ballad in four verses, between each of which the accompanyist played the melody all through, as loud as he could.When this was over, the chairman gave a sentiment, after which, the professional gentleman on the chairman’s right and left volunteered a duet, and sang it, with great applause."
"而真正有趣的是观察那些在人群中分外惹人注目的面孔。主席本人（也就是这个酒馆的主人）是一个粗俗暴躁、五大三粗的汉子。演唱进行的时候，他一双眼睛转个不停，看似乐在其中。他的眼睛打量着发生的一切，耳朵聆听着人们说起的每一件事——无论是眼睛还是耳朵都相当敏锐。坐在他旁边的两个歌手脸上挂着这一职业特有的冷漠。他们正轮流喝着崇拜者递上来的十多杯兑水烈酒，接受着大家的奉承。那些崇拜者则喧闹得多，脸上流露出各种各样的邪恶表情，或多或少、应有尽有，正是这些令人反感的表情使得他们格外吸引人。奸诈、残暴、或轻或重的醉态，在他们脸上表露无遗。至于女人，她们中的一些身上还残留着最后一点清新气息，但也在慢慢消失，眼看就要完全褪去。而另一些女人，她们作为女性的一切特征和印迹，都已丧失殆尽，展现出来的唯有放荡和犯罪所留下的一副令人作呕的空壳子。其中有几个还是女孩，另外一些是少妇，都还未经历生命最好的时光。这一切构成了这幅令人沮丧的画面上最阴暗凄凉的部分。","It was curious to observe some faces which stood out prominently from among the group.There was the chairman himself, (the landlord of the house,) a coarse, rough, heavy built fellow, who, while the songs were proceeding, rolled his eyes hit her and thither, and, seeming to give himself up to joviality, had an eye for everything that was done, and an ear for everything that was said—and sharp ones, too.Near him were the singers: receiving, with professional indifference, the compliments of the company, and applying themselves, in turn, to a dozen proffered glasses of spirits and water, tendered by their more boisterous admirers; whose countenances, whose countenances, expressive of almost every vice in almost every grade, irresistibly attracted the attention, by their very repulsiveness.Cunning, ferocity, and drunkeness in all its stages, were there, in their strongest aspect; and women: some with the last lingering tinge of their early freshness almost fading as you looked:others with every mark and stamp of their sex utterly beaten out, and presenting but one loathsome blank of profligacy and crime; some mere girls, others but young women, and none past the prime of life; formed the darkest and saddest portion of this dreary picture."
"费金并没有被某些严肃的情感困扰。随着这一切的进行，他急切地打量着每一张脸，不过很显然，他没有发现自己要找的那个人。接着，他终于引起了坐在主席椅子上的那个人的注意。他向那人微微招手示意了一下，便跟来时一样悄无声息地离开了。","Fagin, troubled by no grave emotions, looked eagerly from face to face while these proceedings were in progress; but apparently without meeting that of which he was in search.Succeeding, at length, in catching the eye of the man who occupied the chair, he beckoned to him slightly, and left the room, as quietly as he had entered it."
"“费金先生，有什么需要我帮忙的吗？”那个人跟着他出了房间，又走到了楼梯口，问道，“怎么不加入我们呢？他们一定会高兴的，每一个人都会很高兴的。”","“What can I do for you, Mr. Fagin?”  inquired the man, as he followed him out to the landing. “Won’t you join us?They’ll be delighted, every one of ’em.”"
"费金不耐烦地摇摇头，小声问：“他在吗？”","The Jew shook his head impatiently, and said in a whisper, “Is-he-here?”"
"“不在。”那个男人回答。","“No,” replied the man."
"“也没有巴尼的消息吗？”费金问。"," “And no news of Barney?” inquired Fagin."
"“没有。”那人回答，他正是这家瘸子酒馆的老板，“他不会出来活动的，除非等到风平浪静以后。我敢肯定，他们那边已经查到线索了。只要他一动，就会立刻搞砸整件事。他挺好的，巴尼也没出事，否则的话，我应该会听到有关他的消息的。我敢保证，巴尼会把一切都处理好的。就放心交给他吧。”","“None,” replied the landlord of the Cripples; for it was he.“He won’t stir till it’s all safe.Depend on it, they’re on the scent down there; and that if he moved, he’d blow upon the thing at once.He’s all right enough, Barney is, else I should have heard of him.I’ll pound it, that Barney’s managing properly.Let him alone for that.”"
"“他——今天晚上会来这里吗？”费金问道，像之前一样，重点强调了“他”。"," “Will-he- be here to-night?” asked the Jew, laying the same emphasis on the pronoun as before."
"“你指的是蒙克斯，对吗？”店主迟疑地问。","“Monks, do you mean?” inquired the landlord, hesitating."
"“嘘！”费金说，“是的。”"," “Hush!” said the Jew.“Yes.”"
"“当然会来。”店主从表袋里掏出一块金表，回答道，“刚才我还以为他已经到了呢。你再等十分钟，他肯定会在——”“不，不，”费金连忙说道。尽管他可能很想见这个人，不过那人不在，他又似乎感到如释重负，“告诉他我来这儿找过他，让他今天晚上务必去找我。不，还是明天吧。既然他现在不在，定明天时间就够宽松了。”","“Certain,” replied the man, drawing a gold watch from his fob; “I expected him here before now.If you’ll wait ten minutes, he’ll be—” “No, no,” said the Jew, hastily; as though, however desirous he might be to see the person in question, he was nevertheless relieved by his absence. “Tell him I came here to see him; and that he must come to me to-night.No, say to-morrow.As he is not here, to-morrow will be time enough.”"
"“好的！”那人说，“没有别的事情了吗？”"," “Good!” said the man.“Nothing more?”"
"“目前没什么别的可说了。”犹太佬说着往楼下走去。","“Not a word now,” said the Jew, descending the stairs."
"“我说，”对方从栏杆上探出脑袋，沙哑地低语道，“现在可正是做买卖的时间啊！我把菲尔·巴克弄到这里来了。他喝得烂醉如泥，连个小孩也能收拾了他！”","“I say,” said the other, looking over the rails, and speaking in a hoarse whisper; “what a time this would be for a sell!I’ve  got Phil Barker here: so drunk, that a boy might take him!”"
"“哈！不过现在还不是收拾菲尔·巴克的时候。”犹太佬抬头说，","“Ah!But it’s not Phil Barker’s time,” said the Jew, looking up."
"“在我们能一脚踹开菲尔之前，他还有别的事要做。去招呼客人吧，亲爱的，告诉他们要及时行乐——趁着他们还活着——哈！哈！哈！”","“Phil has something more to do, before we can afford to part with him; so go back to the company, my dear, and tell them to lead merry lives—while they last—.Ha!  ha! ha!”"
"店主应和着费金老头笑了几声，就回客人那边去了。此刻费金身边没别人了，他的脸上立马又挂上了之前那副忧心忡忡的表情。沉思了一会儿，他叫来一辆带蓬的出租马车，吩咐车夫向贝丝勒尔草地开去。在离赛克斯先生的住处大约还有四分之一英里的地方，他下了马车，徒步走完了剩下的一小段路。","The landlord reciprocated the old man’s laugh; and returned to his guests.The Jew was no sooner alone, than his countenance resumed its former expression of anxiety and thought.After a brief reflection, he called a hack-cabriolet, and bade the man drive towards Bethnal Green.He dismissed him within some quarter of a mile of Mr. Sikes’s residence, and performed the short remainder of the distance, on foot."
"“快开门，”费金嘟嘟囔囔地敲着门，“要是这里面有什么鬼把戏的话，我一定要从你这儿弄个明白。小丫头片子，随便你怎么狡猾都没用。”","“Now,” muttered the Jew, as he knocked at the door, “if there is any deep play here, I shall have it out of you, my girl, cunning as you are.”"
"开门的女人说那个姑娘在自己的房间里。费金轻手轻脚地走上楼，连招呼也没打就直接进了房间。屋里只有姑娘一个人，她伏在桌子上，头发一片凌乱。","She was in her room, the woman said.Fagin crept softly upstairs, and entered it without any previous ceremony.The girl was alone; lying with her head upon the table, and her hair straggling over it."
"“她一直在喝酒。”费金冷冷地想，“或者她只是有些伤心罢了。”","“She has been drinking,” thought the Jew, cooly, “or perhaps she is only miserable.”"
"老费金一边想，一边转身去关门；那门关上时吱嘎作响，把那姑娘吵醒了。她紧紧盯着费金那张狡猾的面孔，向他详细打听了一番托比·格拉基特所说的情况。问完后，她什么也没说，又像之前那样趴到了桌子上。接着她又不耐烦地把蜡烛推到了一边，发狂似的换了一两次姿势，双脚还在地上磨来磨去，然后又躺下不动了。","The old man turned to close the door, as he made this reflection; the noise thus occasioned, roused the girl.She eyed his crafty face narrowly, as she inquired to his recital of Toby Crackit’s tory.When it was concluded, she sank into her former attitude, but spoke not a word.She pushed the candle impatiently away; and once or twice as she feverishly changed her position, shuffled her feet upon the ground; but this was all."
"趁着她安静下来，费金屋子将屋子打量了一圈，一副心神不宁的样子。他好像是要证实一下，这里确实没有任何迹象，能表明赛克斯已经偷偷溜了回来。这一番检查显然使他相当满意。他咳嗽了两三声，绞尽脑汁想要打开话题，可那姑娘只把他当成石头人，根本不搭理他。最后，他作了另一个尝试。他搓着手，用最温和的口气说道：“亲爱的，你觉得比尔现在会在哪里呢？”","During the silence, the Jew looked restlessly about the room, as if to assure himself that there were no appearances of Sikes having covertly returned.Apparently satisfied with his inspection, he coughed twice or thrice, and made as many efforts to open a conversation; but the girl heeded him no more than if he had been made of stone.At length he made another attempt; and rubbing his hands together, said, in his most conciliatory tone, “And where should you think Bill was now, my dear?”"
"姑娘呻吟着，给出的答复很难听懂，只是说她也不知道。从她臂弯里漏出来的声音有些压抑，听上去她像是快要哭出来了。","The girl moaned out some half intelligible reply, that she could not tell; and seemed, from the smothered noise that escaped her, to be crying."
"“还有那个孩子，”费金说着，使劲瞪大眼睛想要瞥一眼她的脸，“可怜的孩子！被丢在水沟里，南斯，你想想吧！”","“And the boy, too,” said the Jew, straining his eyes to catch a glimpse of her face. “Poor leetle child! Left in a ditch, Nance; only think!”"
"“那个孩子，”南斯突然抬起头，说道，“无论在哪里都比跟着我们好。只要这件事不会连累比尔，我倒是希望他躺在那条水沟里死掉，他那幼小的骨头烂在那里才好呢。”"," “The child,” said the girl, suddenly looking up, “is better where he is, than among us; and if no harm comes to Bill from it, I hope he lies dead in the ditch and that his young bones may rot there.”"
"“你说什么！”犹太佬吃惊地喊道。","“What!” cried the Jew, in amazement."
"“嗯，我就是这个意思。”姑娘迎着他直愣愣的眼神，回答道，“他若能从我眼前彻底消失，最糟糕的事情也能过去，那我才高兴呢。有他在我身边，我才受不了呢。只要一看到他，我就恨我自己，也恨你们所有的人。”","“Ay, I do,” returned the girl, meeting his gaze.“I shall be glad to have him away from my eyes, and to know that the worst is over.I can’t bear to have him about me.The sight of him turns me against myself, and all of you.”"
"“呸！”费金轻蔑地说，“你喝醉了。”","“Pooh!” said the Jew, scornfully.“You’re drunk.”"
"“是吗？”姑娘伤心地叫道，“我没醉！不过这也不是你的错。照你的想法，要不是现在，你巴不得我一辈子都不醒呢——不过目前这情况可不符合你的心思，是不是啊？”"," “Are I?” cried the girl bitterly. “It’s s no fault of yours, if I am not!You’d never have me anything else, if you had your will, except now;—the humour doesn’t suit you, doesn’t it?”"
"“是啊，”犹太佬怒气冲冲地回答，“的确不合我心意。”"," “No!” rejoined the Jew, furiously.  “It does not.”"
"“那我就改改，”姑娘大笑着回答。"," “Change it, then!” responded the girl, with a laugh."
"“改改！”费金大叫起来，身边人出人意料如此顽固，当天晚上又遇到了种种令人不快的事，他的愤怒此刻终于爆发了，“我——真得——给你改改！给我听着，你这个婊子。你给我听着，我现在只要几句话，就可以要了赛克斯的命，就跟现在他那牛脖子已经在我手心里捏着一样稳当。他若是回来了，没带回那个孩子；或是他自己脱了身，却不管孩子是死是活。总而言之，要是他没能把那个小孩交给我，你如果不想让他被杰克·凯奇追杀的话，就亲手结果了他吧。他一进这门，就动手杀了他，否则为时已晚，你可要当心我了！”","“Change it!” exclaimed the Jew, exasperated beyond all bounds by his companion’s unexpected obstinacy, and the vexation of the night, “I—will—change it!Listen to me, you drab.Listen to me, who with six words, can strangle Sikes as surely as if I had his bull’s throat between my fingers now.If he comes back, and leaves the boy behind him; if he gets off free, and dead or alive, fails to restore him to me; murder him yourself if you would have him escape Jack Ketch.And do it the moment he sets foot in this room, or mind me, it will be too late!”"
"“这些都是什么意思啊？”姑娘不禁大叫起来。“什么意思？”费金怒气冲天，继续说道，“那个孩子对我来说值成百上千英镑。就因为一群只要我吹声口哨就能叫他们全都丢掉性命的醉汉自作主张，倒叫我失去了稳稳当当就能赚到钱的大好机会！而且，我跟一个天生的恶魔说好了。那家伙就等着我起这个念头呢，他有的是力气去，去——”费金老头气喘吁吁，被一个字卡在了那里，说不下去了。也就在这个瞬间，他愤怒的爆发被止住了，整个人态度全变了。前一刻，他那紧握的双手还在空中乱抓，眼睛瞪得很圆，神情激动万分，连脸色也发青了。可现在，他瘫在一把椅子里，浑身打哆嗦，唯恐自己泄露了隐藏的罪恶。沉默了一会儿后，他试着转头看了看他旁边的人。看到她依旧无精打采，跟刚才他把她叫起来之前一模一样，他显得放心了许多。","“What is all this?” cried the girl involuntarily.“What is it?” pursued Fagin, mad with rage.“When the boy’s worth hundreds of pounds to me, am I to lose what chance threw me in the way of getting safely, through the whims of a drunken gang that I could whistle away the lives of!And me bound, too, to a born devil that only wants the will, and has the power to, to—” Panting for breath, the old man stammered for a word; and in that instant checked the torrent of his wrath, and changed his whole demeanour.A moment before, his clenched hands had grasped the air; his eyes had dilated; and his face grown livid with passion; but now, he shrunk into a chair, and, cowering together, trembled with the apprehension of having himself disclosed some hidden villainy.After a short silence, he ventured to look round at his companion.He appeared somewhat reassured, on beholding her in the same listless attitude from which he had first roused her."
"“南斯，亲爱的！”费金用平常的口气说道，嗓音低沉沙哑，“你不怪我吧，亲爱的？”","“Nancy, dear!” croaked the Jew, in his usual voice.“Did you mind me, dear?”"
"“费金，现在别烦我了！”姑娘懒洋洋地抬起头，回答道，“要是比尔这次没有得手的话，他还会再下手的。他已经替你做了不少事了，只要他能办到，他还会为你做更多的。要是办不到的话，那就没法子了，你也就别提了。”","“Don’t worry me now, Fagin!” replied the girl, raising her head languidly.“If Bill has not done it this time, he will another.He has done many a good job for you, and will do many more when he can; and when he can’t he won’t; so no more about that.”"
"“关于那个孩子呢，亲爱的？”费金紧张地搓着手掌，问道。“那个孩子得跟着别人碰碰运气了。”南斯连忙打断了他，“我再说一遍，我巴不得他死了呢。那样他就不用再受伤，也不用跟着你们了——就是这样，只要比尔没事，一切都好说。要是托比都溜掉了，比尔肯定不会有事的。比尔无论何时都能顶两个托比呢。”","“Regarding this boy, my dear?” said the Jew, rubbing the palms of his hands nervously together.“The boy must take his chance with the rest,” interrupted Nancy, hastily; “and I say again, I hope he is dead, and out of harm’s way, and out of yours,—that is, if Bill comes to no harm.And if Toby got clear off, Bill’s pretty sure to be safe; for Bill’s worth two of Toby any time.”"
"“亲爱的，我说的那事怎么办呢？”费金双眼闪着光，死死地盯着她，问道。","“And about what I was saying, my dear?” observed the Jew, keeping his glistening eye steadily upon her."
"“要是你有什么要我做的，你得从头到尾再说一遍。”南斯回答，“要是真那样的话，你最好等明天再说。你让我的脑袋清醒了一小会儿，可现在我又有些糊涂了。”","“You must say it all over again, if it’s anything you want me to do,” rejoined Nancy; “and if it is, you had better wait till to-morrow.You put me up for a minute; but now I’m stupid again.”"
"费金又问了几个别的问题，都是为了想要弄清楚，这个姑娘是否已经听出了他刚才不小心说出的话中隐含的深意。姑娘回答得毫不迟疑，对他的打量也显得无动于衷。他最初对她的印象得以证实——她只不过是个喝多了的酒鬼罢了。确实，犹太佬的女弟子都有这个普遍的缺点，南斯也不例外。她们年纪尚小时，非但不曾被制止，反而还被鼓励去喝酒。她蓬头垢面，浑身的酒气充斥着整个屋子，这为费金的推测提供了有力的佐证。当时，她先是像之前描述的那样使劲发泄了一通，继而整个人都陷入了沉默，接着竟百感交集：一会儿泪流满面，一会儿又大喊大叫，说了很多“永远别提死”之类的话。她还说了各种各样的预料，说只要太太、先生们都快乐，没有什么要紧的。费金先生在他有生之年对这样的事情已经积累了相当多的经验，看到她醉成这副模样，颇为满意。","Fagin put several other questions: all with the same drift of ascertaining whether the girl had profited by his unguarded hints; but, she answered them so readily, and was withal so utterly unmoved by his searching looks, that his original impression of her being more than a trifle in liquor, was confirmed.Nancy, indeed, was not exempt from a failing which was very common among the Jew’s female pupils; and in which, in their tenderer years, they were rather encouraged than checked.Her disordered appearance, and a wholesale perfume of Geneva which pervaded the apartment, afforded strong confirmatory evidence of the justice of the Jew’s supposition;and when, after indulging in the temporary display of violence above described, she subsided, first into dullness, and afterwards into a compound of feelings: under the influence of which she shed tears one minute, and in the next gave utterance to various exclamations of “Never say die!”and divers calculations as to what might be the amount of the odds so long as a lady or gentleman was happy, Mr. Fagin, who had had considerable experience of such matters in his time, saw, with great satisfaction, that she was very far gone indeed."
"这一发现让费金安心了，他此行的双重任务也完成了：一方面他把当天晚上听到的消息告诉了南斯，另一方面他亲眼证实了赛克斯还没有回来。于是他抛下了他年轻的同伴，任由她伏在桌子上睡觉，自己回家去了。","Having eased his mind by this discovery; and having accomplished his twofold object of imparting to the girl what he had, that night, heard, and of ascertaining, with his own eyes, that Sikes had not returned, Mr. Fagin again turned his face homeward: leaving his young friend asleep, with her head upon the table."
"此时已是午夜时分。天色漆黑一片，外面冷得刺骨；他实在没什么心情闲荡。凛冽的寒风掠过街道，行人似乎也像尘土一般被风卷走了。路上只有稀稀拉拉几个人，而且很明显都在匆匆往家赶。不过，对犹太佬来说，倒是一路顺风。他走在前头，阵阵冷风在他屁股后面粗鲁地推着他，使他不停打哆嗦。","It was within an hour of midnight.The weather being dark, and piercing cold, he had no great temptation to loiter.The sharp wind that scoured the streets, seemed to have cleared them of passengers, as of dust and mud, for few people were abroad, and they were to all appearance hastening fast home.It blew from the right quarter for the Jew, however, and straight before it he went: trembling, and shivering, as every fresh gust drove him rudely on his way."
"他走到自己住的那条街的拐角处，正要从口袋里摸钥匙，就在这时，一条黑影从对面漆黑的门廊里闪出来，穿过马路，神不知鬼不觉地溜到他旁边。","He had reached the corner of his own street, and was already fumbling in his pocket for the door-key, when a dark figure emerged from a projecting entrance which lay in deep shadow, and, crossing the road, glided up to him unperceived."
"“费金！”一个声音在他耳边低低地响起。","“Fagin!” whispered a voice close to his ear."
"“啊！”犹太佬迅速地转过身，说道，“你是——”“没错！”陌生人打断他的话，“我在这里转了有两个小时了。你到底去了什么鬼地方？”","“Ah!” said the Jew, turning quickly round, “is that—” “Yes!” interrupted the stranger.“I have been lingering here these two hours.Where the devil have you been?”"
"“还不是为了你的事，亲爱的，”犹太佬一边不安地打量着他的同伴，一边放慢了脚步回答道，“一整个晚上都在忙你的事情。”","“On your business, my dear,” replied the Jew, glancing uneasily at his companion, and slackening his pace as he spoke.“On your business all night.”"
"“哦，这是当然的了！”陌生人冷笑着说道，“好吧，都打听到什么了？”","“Oh,of course!” said the stranger, with a sneer.“Well; and what’s come of it?”"
"“没有好消息。”老犹太说。","“Nothing good,” said the Jew."
"“那也没什么坏消息吧，我希望？”陌生人说到这，猛地停了下来，神色慌张地看着他的同伴。","“Nothing bad, I hope?” said the stranger, stopping short, and turning a startled look on his companion."
"老犹太摇摇头，正要回答，却又突然被那陌生人打断了。此时，他们已经走到了房前。那人指了指屋子说，有什么事情最好还是到屋里去谈；他在这周围站了这么久，都冷到骨子里去了。","The Jew shook his head, and was about to reply, when the stranger, interrupting him, motioned to the house, before which they had by this time arrived: remarking, that he had better say what he had got to say, under cover: for his blood was chilled with standing about so long, and the wind blew through him."
"费金看上去很想推托，他不便在这个不合适的时间将外人带到家里。果然，他小声嘟囔着，说屋子里没有生火，他的同伴却专横地重申了自己的要求。他也只能打开门，嘱咐同伴进来后将门轻轻关上，自己则去取了一盏灯。","Fagin looked as if he could have willingly excused himself from taking home a visitor at that unseasonable hour; and, indeed, muttered something about having no fire; but his companion repeating his request in a peremptory manner, he unlocked the door, and requested him to close it softly, while he got a light."
"“这里黑得就跟坟墓一样。”那个人一边说，一边摸索着朝前走了几步，“快一点！”","“It’s s as dark as the grave,” said the man, groping forward a few steps.“Make haste!”"
"“把门关上，”费金在过道那一头小声地说。他刚说完，门口就传来一声关门的巨响。","“Shut the door,” whispered Fagin from the end of the passage.As he spoke, it closed with a loud noise."
"“这可不是我干的。”另一个人一边摸索着方向往前走，一边说，“要么被风吹的，要么就是它自己关上了，就这两个原因。快拿灯过来。要不然在这个乱七八糟的洞里，我非撞个脑袋开花不可。”","“That wasn’t my doing,” said the other man, feeling his way.“The wind blew it to, or it shut of its own accord: one or the other.Look sharp with the light, or I shall knock my brains out against something in this confounded hole.”"
"费金偷偷地走下厨房边的楼梯。过了一会儿，他点着一根蜡烛回来了，还带回了消息说，托比·格拉基特已经在楼下后面的房间里睡着了，男孩们在则前面的房间睡了。费金示意那个人跟上，自己在前面带路往楼上走去。","Fagin stealthily descended the kitchen stairs.After a short absence, he returned with a lighted candle, and the intelligence that Toby Crackit was asleep in the back room below, and that the boys were in the front one.Beckoning the man to follow him, he led the way upstairs."
"“在这里，我们可以说说我们想说的话了，亲爱的，”费金打开二楼的一个门，说道，“百叶窗上有几个窟窿，我们把蜡烛放在楼梯上，这样隔壁就看不到光亮了。喏，就是这样！”","“We can say the few words we’ve  got to say in here, my dear,” said the Jew, throwing open a door on the first floor; “and as there are holes in the shutters, and we never show lights to our neighbours, we’ll set the candle on the stairs.There!”"
"费金说着弯下腰，将蜡烛放在靠上边的楼梯上，正对着房间的门。然后，他带路走进房间。房间里有一把损坏的扶手椅，门后还有一张没有罩子的旧长塌或旧沙发，除此之外，再没有任何别的家具了。陌生人坐到了门后的那张家具上，一副筋疲力尽的样子。犹太佬把扶手椅拖了过来，两个人面对面坐着。房间里不算太黑；外面的蜡烛透过半开着的门，把微弱的光投到了对面的墙上。","With those words, the Jew, stooping down, placed the candle on an upper flight of stairs, exactly opposite to the room door.This done, he led the way into the apartment; which was destitute of all movables save a broken arm-chair, and an old couch or sofa without covering, which stood behind the door.Upon this piece of furniture, the stranger sat himself with the air of a weary man; and the Jew, drawing up the arm-chair opposite, they sat face to face.It was not quite dark; the door was partially open; and the candle outside, threw a feeble reflection on the opposite wall."
"他们低声谈了一会儿。除了偶尔能够听到几个断断续续的字眼外，谈话的内容根本听不清楚。不过，如果现在旁边有个听众的话，还是可以很容易听出费金似乎是在就同伴的某些话语替自己辩护，而后者则相当愤怒。就这样，他们谈了一刻钟，或许更长一点；就在这时，蒙克斯——犹太佬在谈话中几次这样称呼陌生人——稍微提高了嗓门说道：“我再跟你说一遍，这事安排得坏透了。为什么不让他跟其他几个人呆在一起，一次性训练成一个偷偷摸摸、爱哭鼻子的扒手不就得了？”","They conversed for some time in whispers. Though nothing of the conversation was distinguishable beyond a few disjointed words here and there, a listener might easily have perceived that Fagin appeared to be defending himself against some remarks of the stranger; and that the latter was in a state of considerable irritation.They might have been talking, thus, for a quarter of an hour or more, when Monks—by which name the Jew had designated the strange man several times in the course of their colloquy—said, raising his voice a little, “I tell you again, it was badly planned.Why not have kept him here among the rest, and made a sneaking, snivelling pickpocket of him at once?”"
"“你说得倒容易！”老犹太耸耸肩，说道。","“Only hear him!” exclaimed the Jew, shrugging his shoulders."
"“怎么，你的意思是说，就算你有这样的想法，也办不到是不是？”蒙克斯严厉地说，“你在别的小子身上不是也做过几十次了吗？只要你有耐心，最多一年，不就可以让他被判有罪，稳稳当当地被送出英国，没准一辈子都回不来了呢？”","“Why, do you mean to say you couldn’t have done it, if you had chosen?” demanded Monks,sternly.“Haven’t you done it, with other boys, scores of times?If you had had patience for a twelvemonth, at most, couldn’t you have got him convicted, and sent safely out of the kingdom; perhaps for life?”"
"“这样的话，好处是谁的啊，亲爱的？”老犹太恭顺地询问。","“Whose turn would that have served, my dear?” inquired the Jew humbly."
"“我的啊。”蒙克斯回答。","“Mine,” replied Monks."
"“又不是归我。”老犹太依旧顺从地说，“对我来说，他本来就是有用的。一桩生意双方都参与，就得双方都捞得到好处才算合理，是不是，我亲爱的朋友？”","“But not mine,” said the Jew, submissively.“He might have become of use to me.When there are two parties to a bargain, it is only reasonable that the interests of both should be consulted; is it, my good friend?”"
"“那又怎样？”蒙克斯问。","“What then?” demanded Monks."
"“我觉得要训练他干这一行不是很容易。”老犹太回答，“他跟其他处境相同的男孩不一样。”","“I saw it was not easy to train him to the business,” replied the Jew; “he was not like other boys in the same circumstances.”"
"“让他见鬼去吧，的确是不一样！”那人嘀咕道，“否则他早就成一个小偷了。”"," “Curse him, no!” muttered the man, “or he would have been a thief, long ago.”"
"“我没有抓到他的把柄，没法威胁他走上歪路。”犹太佬局促不安地注视着同伴的脸色，继续说道，“他的手还是干净的。我没有什么能恐吓他的东西。刚开始的时候，这些东西我们总得有点儿才行，要不然我们就会白费力气。我能做什么啊？把他派出去跟机灵鬼和查理一起做事？亲爱的，这个方法刚开始那会儿给我们惹的麻烦已经够多了，我那时真替我们大家提着一颗心。”","“I had no hold upon him to make him worse,” pursued the Jew, anxiously watching the countenance of his companion. “His hand was not in.I had nothing to frighten him with; which we always must have in the beginning, or we labour in vain.What could I do?Send him out with the Dodger and Charley?We had enough of that, at first, my dear; I trembled for us all.”"
"“这——不关我的事。”蒙克斯说。","“—That—was not my doing,” observed Monks."
"“不关你事，不关你事，亲爱的！”犹太佬继续道，“现在我不想争论这件事。因为要是压根就没这事，你根本就不会注意到他，继而发现他就是你要找的人。对了！靠着那个姑娘，我替你把他找了回来。从那时候起，那姑娘就护上他了。”","“No, no, my dear!” renewed the Jew.“And I don’t quarrel with it now; because, if it had never happened, you might never have clapped eyes on the boy to notice him, and so led to the discovery that it was him you were looking for.Well!I got him back for you by means of the girl; and then-she- begins to favour him.”"
"“掐死那个娘们儿！”蒙克斯不耐烦地说。","“Throttle the girl!” said Monks, impatiently."
"“嗨，现在我们还不能这么做，亲爱的。”犹太佬笑着回答，“况且，这种事情也没挡我们的道。不过或许哪一天，我会很乐意找个人把这事给办了。我知道这些娘们儿到底是什么货色，蒙克斯，我很了解她们。一旦那个男孩的心肠硬起来，她对他的关心不会比对一块木头多的。你想叫他当小偷。只要他活着，我就能够在日后让他成为一个小偷。要是——要是——”犹太佬拉着椅子朝着对方凑近了些，说道，“这倒不太可能——不过你听着，要是最坏最坏的情况发生了，他死了——”“要是他死了，那决不是我的错！”另一位先生立刻打断了他，露出一副惊恐万分的表情，双手还颤抖地抓着犹太佬的胳膊，“你听着，费金！这事跟我无关。从一开始我就给你说了，什么事都行，只是不能让他死。我不想见血。这种事情迟早会藏不住，而且还老是让人心里忘不了。要是他们开枪打死了他，不是我的错。你听见了吗？快放火烧了这地狱般的贼窝！那是什么？”","“Why, we can’t afford to do that just now, my dear,” replied the Jew, smiling; “and, besides, that sort of thing is not in our way; or, one of these days, I might be glad to have it done.I know what these girls are, Monks, well.As soon as the boy begins to harden, she’ll care no more for him, than for a block of wood.You want him made a thief.If he is alive, I can make him one from this time; and, if—if—” said the Jew, drawing nearer to the other,—“it’s s not likely, mind,—but if the worst comes to the worst, and he is dead—” “It’s s no fault of mine if he is!” interposed the other man, with a look of terror, and clasping the Jew’s arm with trembling hands.“Mind that.Fagin!I had no hand in it.Anything but his death, I told you from the first.I won’t shed blood; it’s always found out, and haunts a man besides.If they shot him dead, I was not the cause; do you hear me?Fire this infernal den!What’s that?”"
"“什么！”犹太佬大叫起来，双臂一张，将那个吓得一跃而起的胆小鬼整个抱住，“哪里？”","“What!” cried the Jew, grasping the coward round the body, with both arms, as he sprung to his feet.“Where?”"
"“那边！”那人盯着对面的墙，说道，“是个人影！我看到一个女人的影子，裹着披风，戴着圆帽，就一阵风一样贴着护壁板溜了过去！”","“Yonder!” replied the man, glaring at the opposite wall.“The shadow!I saw the shadow of a woman, in a cloak and bonnet, pass along the wainscot like a breath!”"
"犹太佬松开手臂，两个人一起吵吵嚷嚷地冲了出去。蜡烛依旧立在之前的位置上；那边有穿堂风吹过，蜡烛烧得格外快。烛光中，他们看到的只有空荡荡的楼梯和他们两人苍白的面孔。他们凝神细听，整个屋子一片沉寂。","The Jew released his hold, and they rushed tumultuously from the room.The candle, wasted by the draught, was standing where it had been placed.It showed them only the empty staircase, and their own white faces.They listened intently: a profound silence reigned throughout the house."
"“是你的幻觉。”老犹太拿起蜡烛，转向他的同伴说。","“It’s your fancy,” said the Jew, taking up the light and turning to his companion."
"“我发誓我看见了！”蒙克斯颤抖地回答道，“我第一眼看到的时候，那个影子正向前弯着身子。我一说话，它就快速跑开了。”","“I’ll swear I saw it!” replied Monks, trembling.“It was bending forward when I saw it first; and when I spoke, it darted away.”"
"老犹太轻蔑地扫了一眼脸色苍白的同伴，然后说要是他愿意，可以跟着自己去看看。说罢，他便走上了楼梯。他们查看了所有的房间，每个房间里都是空的，里面冷得很，根本没有半个人影。他们下到走廊里，随后又走进了地下室。青色的潮气附在低矮的墙壁上，蜗牛、鼻涕虫爬过的痕迹在烛光下闪闪发光，但一切都仍然如死一般寂静。","The Jew glanced contemptuously at the pale face of his associate, and, telling him he could follow, if he pleased, ascended the stairs.They looked into all the rooms; they were cold, bare, and empty.They descended into the passage, and thence into the cellars below.The green damp hung upon the low walls; the tracks of the snail and slug glistened in the light of the candle; but all was still as death."
"“现在你怎么看？”当他们又回到走廊里时，老犹太说道，“除了咱们两个，以及托比和那群男孩之外，这个屋子里连个活物都没有。再说了，托比他们够安分了。你瞧！”","“What do you think now?” said the Jew, when they had regained the passage.“Besides ourselves, there’s not a creature in the house except Toby and the boys; and they’re safe enough.See here!”"
"犹太佬从口袋里掏出两把钥匙作为证据，并解释说，为了保证谈话不受干扰，他第一次下楼的时候就把那帮孩子锁在了里面。","As a proof of the fact, the Jew drew forth two keys from his pocket; and explained, that when he first went downstairs, he had locked them in, to prevent any intrusion on the conference."
"这一刚刚添加的证据很有说服力，蒙克斯先生动摇起来。两人继续进行搜索，但仍旧一无所获，他的抗议也逐渐变得不那么强烈了。这时候他恣意发出了几声狞笑，承认或许那时自己兴奋过度，产生了幻觉。这时，他突然意识到时间已经过了一点，便表示这个晚上他不愿再谈下去了。于是，这一对亲密的朋友便就此分手了。","This accumulated testimony effectually staggered Mr. Monks.His protestations had gradually become less and less vehement as they proceeded in their search without making any discovery; and, now, he gave vent to several very grim laughs, and confessed it could only have been his excited imagination.He declined any renewal of the conversation, however, for that night: suddenly remembering that it was past one o’clock.And so the amiable couple parted."
"第二十七章 为前面某章中极其不礼貌地将一位女士抛在一旁的行为致歉","CHAPTER XXVII At ones for the unpoliteness of a former chapter; which deserted a lady, most unceremoniously "
"一个地位卑微的作家，让教区执事这样极具权威的人物把大衣下摆夹在胳膊底下，背对着火炉坐在一旁，一直等到笔者乐意让他休息为止，这种作法是极其失礼的。执事含情脉脉地注视过的那位女士也连带着给忽略了，这就更加与作者的身份和风范不符了。执事刚刚在这位女士耳边低声倾诉过的那些甜言蜜语是大有来头的，足以让无论什么身份的小姐、太太都心如鹿撞。作为用笔写下这些文字的作者——本人很清楚自己的地位，并且对身处高位、手握重权者怀有恰如其分的敬意——迫不及待地想要向他们表示出他们的职位所要求的那种尊重，并且用一切他们的高贵身份和（随之而来的）美好德行所要求的礼节来对待他们，这在本人笔下必有体现。确实，处于这个目的，笔者曾打算在这里用较多篇幅对教区执事神圣的权力进行一番详述，并阐明这样一种观点，即执事是不会干错事的。这一定会使心平气和的读者既愉快又有所收获。不过遗憾的是，由于时间和篇幅所限，笔者不得不把这一番论述推迟到某个更加方便和合适的时机。到时笔者将会论述，一位合法任命的执事,即一位隶属教区济贫院且在教区教堂行使其职权的执事,以他所服务机构的公正与美德作证，拥有人类所有的优点和长处。而一般的公司执事、法院执事或者小教堂的执事（最后一类属于例外，他们的地位非常低贱），离这些优点中任何一种都搭不上一点边。","As it would be, by no means, seemly in a humble author to keep so mighty a personage as a beadle waiting, with his back to the fire, and the skirts of his coat gathered up under his arms, until such time as it might suit his pleasure to relieve him; and as it would still less become his station,or his gallantry to involve in the same neglect a lady on whom that beadle had looked with an eye of tenderness and affection, and in whose ear he had whispered sweet words, which, coming from such a quarter, might well thrill the bosom of maid or matron of whatsoever degree;the historian whose pen traces these words—trusting that he knows his place, and that he entertains a becoming reverence for those upon earth to whom high and important authority is delegated—hastens to pay them that respect which their position demands, and to treat them with all that duteous ceremony which their exalted rank, and (by consequence) great virtues, imperatively claim at his hands.Towards this end, indeed, he had purposed to introduce, in this place, a dissertation touching the divine right of beadles, and elucidative of the position, that a beadle can do no wrong: which could not fail to have been both pleasurable and profitable to the right-minded reader but which he is unfortunately compelled, by want of time and space, to postpone to some more convenient and fitting opportunity;on the arrival of which, he will be prepared to show, that a beadle properly constituted: that is to say, a parochial beadle, attached to a parochail workhouse, and attending in his official capacity the parochial church: is, in right and virtue of his office, possessed of all the excellences and best qualities of humanity;and that to none of those excellences, can mere companies” beadles, or court-of-law beadles, or even chapel-of-ease beadles (save the last, and they in a very lowly and inferior degree), lay the remotest sustainable claim."
"邦布尔先生重新数了数茶匙的数目，再一次掂了掂糖钳，然后又更仔细地考查了一下奶壶，细致入微地对家具的情况进行了一番查看，甚至连马鬃椅垫都没放过。他将每个程序都重复了整整六次，然后才想到科尼太太该回来了。他的想法一个接一个跳出来。因为还没有听到科尼太太回来的声音，邦布尔先生不禁想瞅一眼科尼太太橱柜里头的东西，以满足一下自己的好奇心。这也算是一种毫无恶意、符合道德的打发时间的方法。","Mr. Bumble had re-counted the teaspoons, re-weighed the sugar-tongs, made a closer inspection of the milk-pot, and ascertained to a nicety the exact condition of the furniture, down to the very horse-hair seats of the chairs; and had repeated each process full half a dozen times; before he began to think that it was time for Mrs. Corney to return.Thinking begets thinking; as there were no sounds of Mrs. Corney’s approach, it occured to Mr. Bumble that it would be an innocent and virtuous way of spending the time, if he were further to allay his curiousity by a cursory glance at the interior of Mrs. Corney’s chest of drawers."
"邦布尔先生贴着锁眼听了听，确信没有人正往这个房间走来，然后便从最下面的抽屉下手，依次了解了三个长抽屉里的内容：里面装着各种各样的衣物，样式新潮、质地上乘，用上下各两层旧报纸极为细致地保护了起来，上面还撒有薰衣草的干花；这些发现似乎使他非常满意。最后，他打开右手边角落的抽屉（里面摆着钥匙），看见里面放着一个上了挂锁的小盒子。他摇了摇这个盒子，盒子发出了令人愉悦的响声，好像是钱币的叮当声。邦布尔先生迈着庄严的步子回到壁炉前，恢复了之前的姿势，神色严肃、表情坚定地说：“就这么办了！”抒发完这一重大的宣言，他滑稽地摇起了脑袋，足足摇了十分钟，像是在告诫自己要当一只讨人喜欢的小狗似的。接着他从侧面打量了一下自己的双腿，看上去非常开心，兴致也很高。","Having listened at the keyhole, to assure himself that nobody was approaching the chamber, Mr. Bumble, beginning at the bottom, proceeded to make himself acquainted with the contents of the three long drawers: which, being filled with various garments of good fashion and texture, carefully preserved between two layers of old newspapers, speckled with dried lavender: seemed to yield him exceeding satisfaction.Arriving, in course of time, at the right-hand corner drawer (in which was the key), and beholding therein a small padlocked box, which, being shaken, gave forth a pleasant sound, as of the chinking of coin, Mr. Bumble returned with a stately walk to the fireplace; and, resuming his old attitude, said, with a grave and determined air, “I’ll do it!”He followed up this remarkable declaration, by shaking his head in a waggish manner for ten minutes, as though he were remonstrating with himself for being such a pleasant dog; and then, he took a view of his legs in profile, with much seeming pleasure and interest."
"他正在悠闲地进行最后的审视，，科尼太太突然冲进了屋子，气喘吁吁地倒在了壁炉边的一把椅子上。她一只手捂着眼睛，另一只手捂着心口，大口大口地喘着粗气。","He was still placidly engaged in this latter survey, when Mrs. Corney, hurrying into the room, threw herself, in a breathless state, on a chair by the fireside, and covering her eyes with one hand, placed the other over her heart, and gasped for breath."
"“科尼太太，”邦布尔先生在女总管身前弯下了腰，问道，“这是怎么了，太太？发生什么事了，太太？求求您回答我啊，我可是如坐——如坐——”邦布尔先生一时惊慌，没想起“针毡”这个词，便只得用“破瓶子”接了下去。","“Mrs. Corney,” said Mr. Bumble, stooping over the matron, “what is this, ma’am?Has anything happened, ma’am?Pray answer me: I’m on—on—” Mr. Bumble, in his alarm, could not immediately think of the word “tenterhooks,” so he said “broken bottles.”"
"“哦，邦布尔先生！”女总管大叫一声，“刚才真是难受死我了！”","“Oh, Mr. Bumble!” cried the lady, “I have been so dreadfully put out!”"
"“难受，夫人！”邦布尔先生惊呼，“谁胆敢——？我知道了！”邦布尔先生带着天生的庄严，控制住自己，说道，“准是那群该死的穷鬼！”","“Put out,ma’am!” exclaimed Mr.bumble; “who has dared to—? I know!” said Mr. Bumble, checking himself, with native majesty, “this is them wicious paupers!”"
"“想想就觉得可怕！”女主管边发抖边说。","“It’s dreadful to think of!” said the lady, shuddering."
"“那就——不要——想了，夫人。”邦布尔先生回答。","“Then—don’t—think of it, ma’am,” rejoined Mr. Bumble."
"“我控制不住自己。”女士呜咽道。","“I can’t help it,” whimpered the lady."
"“那就来点儿吃的喝的吧。”邦布尔先生体贴地说道，“来点儿红酒怎么样？”","“Then take something, ma’am,” said Mr. Bumble soothingly.“A little of the wine?”"
"“这绝对不行啊！”科尼太太回答，","“Not for the world!” replied Mrs. Corney."
"“我不能——哦！在右手边最上面那一层——哦！”说完这些，这位女士神情恍惚地指了指碗橱，内心情感激荡，全身一阵痉挛。邦布尔先生冲向了碗橱，按照这些语无伦次的指示，从架子上抓起一只容量为一品脱的绿色玻璃瓶，倒了满满一茶杯，然后把杯子递到了这位女士的唇边。","“I couldn’t,—oh!The top shelf in the right-hand corner—oh!”Uttering these words, the good lady pointed, distractedly, to the cupboard, and underwent a convulsion from internal spasms.Mr. Bumble rushed to the closet; and, snatching a pint green-glass bottle from the shelf thus incoherently indicated, filled a tea-cup with its contents, and held it to the lady’s lips."
"“我现在好多了。”科尼太太喝了半杯后，又重新倒回了椅背上。","“I’m better now,” said Mrs. Corney, falling back, after drinking half of it."
"邦布尔先生虔诚地抬头看着天花板，以示对上帝的感激。接着他把目光向下移到了茶杯边上，端起杯子凑到了鼻子下面。","Mr. Bumble raised his eyes piously to the ceiling in thankfulness; and, bringing them down again to the brim of the cup, lifted it to his nose."
"“薄荷，”科尼太太一边弱弱地说，一边笑眯眯地望着教区执事，里面放了一点点——一点点其他的东西。”","“Peppermint,” exclaimed Mrs. Corney, in a faint voice, smiling gently on the beadle as she spoke.“Try it!There’s a little—a little something else in it.”"
"邦布尔先生带着怀疑的神色，尝了尝这种药水；他抿了抿嘴唇，又尝了一口，这才放下了空杯子。","Mr. Bumble tasted the medicine with a doubtful look; smacked his lips; took another taste; and put the cup down empty."
"“喝这个让人觉得很舒服。”科尼太太说道。","“It’s very comforting,” said Mrs. Corney."
"“确实如此，太太。”教区执事答道。他一边说，一边拖了把椅子到女总管身旁，然后柔声询问她，究竟发生了什么事情，竟让她如此难受。","“Very much so indeed, ma’am,” said the beadle.As he spoke, he drew a chair beside the matron, and tenderly inquired what had happened to distress her."
"“没什么，”科尼太太回答，“我就是一个愚蠢、易激动、脆弱不堪的女人。”","“Nothing,” replied Mrs. Corney.“I am a foolish, excitable, weak creetur.”"
"“您不脆弱，太太。”邦布尔边反驳边把椅子挪得更近了一点，“科尼太太，您是一个脆弱的女人吗？”","“Not weak, ma’am,” retorted Mr. Bumble, drawing his chair a little closer.“Are you a weak creetur, Mrs. Corney?”"
"“我们都是脆弱的人。”科尼太太说，定下了一条普遍原理。","“We are all weak creeturs,” said Mrs. Corney, laying down a general principle."
"“我们就是！”执事附和道。","“So we are,” said the beadle."
"接下来的一两分钟内，双方都一言不发。这段时间过后，邦布尔先生为了阐述他的观点，将之前搭在科尼太太椅背上的左臂移到她的围裙系带上；他的手臂逐渐环住了她的腰，和系带缠绕在一起。","Nothing was said on either side, for a minute or two afterwards.By the expiration of that time, Mr. Bumble had illustrated the position by removing his left arm from the back of Mrs. Corney’s chair, where it had previously rested, to Mrs. Corney’s apron-string, round which it gradually became entwined."
"“我们都是脆弱的人。”邦布尔先生说。","“We are all weak creeturs,” said Mr. Bumble."
"科尼太太叹了口气。","Mrs. Corney sighed."
"“不要叹气，科尼太太。”邦布尔先生说。","“Don’t sigh, Mrs. Corney,” said Mr. Bumble."
"“我控制不住自己。”科尼太太说着，又叹了口气。","“I can’t help it,” said Mrs. Corney.And she sighed again."
"“这是一个非常舒适的房间，夫人。”邦布尔先生说着环视了一下四周，“要是再有一间，夫人，就完美了。”","“This is a very comfortable room, ma’am,” said Mr. Bumble looking round.“Another room, and this, ma’am, would be a complete thing.”"
"“一个人住房间太多了。”女士小声地说。","“It would be too much for one,” murmured the lady."
"“不过，两个人住就不算多了。”邦布尔先生柔柔地说，“嗯，科尼太太？”","“But not for two, ma’am,” rejoined Mr. Bumble, in soft accents.“Eh, Mrs. Corney?”"
"邦布尔先生说这番话的时候，科尼太太低下了头。邦布尔先生为了看清科尼太太的脸庞，也把头低了下来。科尼太太相当得体地把头扭到一旁，伸手去拿自己口袋里的手绢，但不知怎么的却把手放进了邦布尔先生手里。","Mrs. Corney drooped her head, when the beadle said this; the beadle drooped his, to get a view of Mrs. Corney’s face.Mrs. Corney, with great propriety, turned her head away, and released her hand to get at her pocket-handkerchief; but insensibly replaced it in that of Mr. Bumble."
"“理事会给您补贴煤了，对吧，科尼太太？”教区执事一边问，一边热情洋溢地用力握紧她的手。","“The board allows you coals, don’t they, Mrs. Corney?” inquired the beadle, affectionately pressing her hand."
"“还有蜡烛。”科尼太太也轻轻地反握着他的手。","“And candles,” replied Mrs. Corney, slightly returning the pressure."
"“有煤、蜡烛，房租还不用交。”邦布尔先生说，“哦，科尼太太，您真是一位天使啊！”","“Coals, candles, and house-rent free,” said Mr. Bumble.“Oh, Mrs. Corney, what an Angel you are!”"
"这位女士再也无法抗拒这感情的爆发。她倒在了邦布尔先生的怀里；这位绅士激动万分，在她那贞洁的鼻子印下了一个饱含深情的吻。","The lady was not proof against this burst of feeling.She sank into Mr. Bumble’s arms; and that gentleman in his agitation, imprinted a passionate kiss upon her chaste nose."
"“这是何等教区式的完美啊！”邦布尔先生狂喜地叫着，“你知道吗，今晚斯洛特先生的情况变得更糟了，我亲爱的美人？”","“Such porochial perfection!” exclaimed Mr. Bumble, rapturously.“You know that Mr. Slout is worse to-night, my fascinator?”"
"“知道。”科尼太太红着脸回答。","“Yes,” replied Mrs. Corney, bashfully."
"“医生说他活不过一个星期了，”邦布尔先生继续说道，“他是这个机构的头头，一死就会留下一个空位子，而这个空位必须得找人填补上。啊呀，科尼太太，这件事带来了多么美妙的未来啊！这是多么好的一个机会，把两颗心连到一体，把两个家庭组成一个啊！”","“He can’t live a week, the doctor says,” pursued Mr. Bumble.“He is the master of this establishment; his death will cause a wacancy; that wacancy must be filled up.Oh, Mrs. Corney, what a prospect this opens!What a opportunity for a jining of hearts and housekeepings!”"
"科尼太太抽噎着。","Mrs. Corney sobbed."
"“那个小小的词？”邦布尔先生朝着害羞的美人弯下腰来，说道，“那个小小的，小小的词，我亲爱的科尼？”","“The little word?” said Mr. Bumble, bending over the bashful beauty.“The one little, little, little word, my blessed Corney?”"
"“我愿——愿——愿意！”女总管叹了口气道。","“Ye—ye—yes!” sighed out the matron."
"“再说一次，”教区执事继续说，“把你那可爱的感情凝聚到一起，就再说一次。什么时候把事办了啊？”","“One more,” pursued the beadle; “compose your darling feelings for only one more.When is it to come off?”"
"科尼太太两次想要尝试着开口，但是两次都失败了。最后，她鼓足了勇气，双手环住邦布尔先生的脖子，说这事他想多早办都行，还说他是“一只让人无法抗拒的小鸭子”。","Mrs. Corney twice essayed to speak: and twice failed.At length summoning up courage, she threw her arms around Mr. Bumble’s neck, and said, it might be as soon as ever he pleased, and that he was “a irresistible duck.”"
"事情就这样友爱圆满地敲定了。他们两人又喝了一杯薄荷混合剂，他们之间的合约就这样庄重签订了。女士此时心跳加速、激动无比，看来这一杯还是很必要的。喝完后，她把那老婆子病死的事情告诉了邦布尔先生。","Matters being thus amicably and satisfactorily arranged, the contract was solemnly ratified in another teacupful of the peppermint mixture; which was rendered the more necessary, by the flutter and agitation of the lady’s spirits.While it was being disposed of, she acquainted Mr. Bumble with the old woman’s decease."
"“很好，”绅士喝了一小口薄荷混合剂，说道，“我回家的时候去苏尔伯雷的铺子里打声招呼，通知他明天早上就把棺材送过来。就是这件事情吓到你了，是不是，亲爱的？”","“Very good,” said that gentleman, sipping his peppermint; “I’ll call at Sowerberry’s as I go home, and tell him to send to-morrow morning.Was it that as frightened you, love?”"
"“这也不是什么特别的事情，亲爱的。”女士推托道。","“It wasn’t anything particular, dear,” said the lady evasively."
"“一定有事，亲爱的。”邦布尔先生力劝道，“你难道不愿意告诉自己的另一半吗？”","“It must have been something, love,” urged Mr. Bumble.“Won’t you tell your own B. ?”"
"“现在不行，”女士回答，“改天吧。等我们结婚以后，亲爱的。”","“Not now,” rejoined the lady; “one of these days.After we’re married, dear.”"
"“等我们结婚以后！”邦布尔先生叫起来，“不会是哪个穷小子竟然放肆到——”“不是的，不是的，亲爱的！”女士连忙打断他。","“After we’re married!” exclaimed Mr. Bumble.“It wasn’t any impudence from any of them male paupers as—” “No, no, love!” interposed the lady, hastily."
"“如果被我知道了有这么一件事，”邦布尔先生继续说道，“要是被我知道他们之中的任何一个，胆敢向这张可爱的面孔抬一下他那肮脏的眼睛的话——”“他们不会这样的胆子的，亲爱的。”女士回答说。","“If I thought it was,” continued Mr. Bumble; “if I thought as any one of ’em had dared to lift his wulgar eyes to that lovely countenance—” “They wouldn’t have dared to do it, love,” responded the lady."
"“他们最好不要！”邦布尔先生攥紧拳头说道，“我倒是想看看是哪个男人，不管是教区内的还是教区外的，竟敢做这种事情。我要告诉他，他绝对不会有机会做第二次了！”","“They had better not!” said Mr. Bumble, clenching his fist. “Let me see any man, porochial or extra-porochial, as would presume to do it; and I can tell him that he wouldn’t do it a second time!”"
"要是没有慷慨激昂的手势，这番话似乎并不能算是对这位女士的魅力的高度赞美。不过邦布尔先生一边威胁，一边伴以各种好斗的姿势。他这种献身精神深深打动了这位女士。她带着无限深情，说他确实是一只讨人喜欢的小鸽子。","Unembellished by any violence of gesticulation, this might have seemed no very high compliment to the lady’s charms; but, as Mr. Bumble accompanied the threat with many warlike gestures, she was much touched with this proof of his devotion, and protested, with great admiration, that he was indeed a dove."
"这只鸽子把外套领子翻起来，戴上三角帽，与自己未来的伴侣长时间深情拥抱了一会儿，然后无畏地迎着深夜里的寒风离开了。他只是在男贫民室逗留了几分钟，简单骂了他们几句。如此一来他便证明了自己能凭借这种不可或缺的尖酸刻薄，来谋取济贫院院长的空缺；他心满意足了。邦布尔先生确信自己能够胜任该职后，美滋滋地离开了那幢房子。他满脑子里想的都是即将晋升的灿烂前景，就这样一直走到丧事承办者的店门口。","The dove then turned up his coat-collar, and put on his cocked hat; and, having exchanged a long and affectionate embrace with his future partner, once again braved the cold wind of the night: merely pausing, for a few minutes, in the male paupers’ ward, to abuse them a little, with the view of satisfying himself that he could fill the office of workhouse-master with needful acerbity.Assured of his qualifications, Mr. Bumble left the building with a light heart, and bright visions of his future promotion: which served to occupy his mind until he reached the shop of the undertaker."
"这时候，苏尔伯雷先生和苏尔伯雷太太都去外面吃茶点和晚餐了。诺亚·克雷波尔只是在便于履行吃喝这两种职能的时候才不会介意体力消耗，超过以上消耗的体力活，他在任何时候都不愿承担。尽管已经过了平日里打烊的时间，铺子依旧开着门。邦布尔先生用他的手杖在柜台上敲了几下，不过丝毫没有引起任何注意。他看见铺子后面小客厅里点着一根蜡烛，烛光从玻璃窗里透了出来，便大胆地往里面看了看，想要看看里面的人在干什么。当他看清楚里面的情况后，不由得大吃一惊。","Now, Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry having gone out to tea and supper: and Noah Claypole not being at any time disposed to take upon himself a greater amount of physical exertion than is necessary to a convenient performance of the two functions of eating and drinking, the shop was not closed, although it was past the usual hour of shutting-up. Mr. Bumble tapped with his cane on the counter several times; but, attracting no attention, and beholding a light shining through the glass-window of the little parlour at the back of the shop, he made bold to peep in and see what was going forward; and when he saw what was going forward, he was not a little surprised."
"晚餐桌布已经铺好了。饭桌上堆满了面包、黄油、盘子、玻璃杯，以及一罐黑啤酒和一瓶葡萄酒。桌子首座的那一头，诺亚·克雷波尔先生无精打采地坐在一把安乐椅上，双腿搭在一边的扶手上，一只手握着一把打开的弹簧摺刀，另一只手拿着一大块涂有黄油的面包。夏洛特站在他的旁边，正从一个桶里把牡蛎拿出来剖开。克雷波尔先生屈尊俯就，极为贪婪地将这些牡蛎一一吞吃下腹。这位绅士的鼻子周围比平时还要红，右眼眨巴着老盯住一个地方，显然他已经略有一些醉意了；他吃牡蛎时表现出来的浓厚兴趣也证实了这一点。牡蛎并没有什么别的功效，清内热的作用倒是一等一的好。","The cloth was laid for supper; the table was covered with bread and butter, plates and glasses; a porter-pot and a wine-bottle.At the upper end of the table, Mr. Noah Claypole lolled negligently in an easy-chair, with his legs thrown over one of the arms: an open clasp-knife in one hand, and a mass of buttered bread in the other.Close beside him stood Charlotte, opening oysters from a barrel: which Mr. Claypole condescended to swallow, with remarkable avidity.A more than ordinary redness in the region of the young gentleman’s nose, and a kind of fixed wink in his right eye, denoted that he was in a slight degree intoxicated; these symptoms were confirmed by the intense relish with which he took his oysters, for which nothing but a strong appreciation of their cooling properties, in cases of internal fever, could have sufficiently accounted."
"“这只肥的味道美极了，诺亚，亲爱的！”夏洛蒂说到，“尝尝看，来，就这一只。”","“Here’s a delicious fat one, Noah, dear!” said Charlotte; “try him, do; only this one”"
"“牡蛎真是人间美味啊！”克雷波尔先生咽下那只后，评论道，","“What a delicious thing is a oyster!” remarked Mr. Claypole, after he had swallowed it."
"“遗憾的是，吃不了几只你就会觉得不舒服，是吧，夏洛特？”","“What a pity it is, a number of ’em should ever make you feel uncomfortable; isn’t it, Charlotte?”"
"“这可真是件残酷的事。”夏洛特说。","“It’s quite a cruelty,” said Charlotte."
"“是啊。”克雷波尔先生附和道，“你不喜欢吃吗？”","“So it is,” acquiesced Mr. Claypole.“An’t yer fond of oysters?”"
"“不是太喜欢。”夏洛特回答，“我喜欢看着你吃，亲爱的诺亚，这比我自己吃还有滋味呢。”","“Not overmuch,” replied Charlotte.“I like to see you eat ’em, Noah dear, better than eating ’em myself.”"
"“呦！”诺亚若有所思地说，“真奇怪啊！”","“Lor!” said Noah, reflectively; “how queer!”"
"“再吃一个，”夏洛特说，“这一只的须是多么漂亮精美啊！”","“Have another,” said Charlotte.“Here’s one with such a beautiful, delicate beard!”"
"“我吃不下了。”诺亚说，“非常抱歉，过来，夏洛特，让我亲亲你。”","“I can’t manage any more,” said Noah.“I’m very sorry.Come here, Charlotte, and I’ll kiss yer.”"
"“你说什么！”邦布尔先生冲进了屋里，说道，“先生，你再说一遍。”","“What!” said Mr. Bumble, bursting into the room.“Say that again, sir.”"
"夏洛特尖叫了一声，把脸埋进了她的围裙里。克雷波尔先生则没怎么改变姿势，只是把双腿放了下来。他久久地盯着教区执事看，一双醉眼里盛着满满的恐惧。","Charlotte uttered a scream, and hid her face in her apron.Mr. Claypole, without making any further change in his position than suffering his legs to reach the ground, gazed at the beadle in drunken terror."
"“再说一遍，你这个花言巧语、色胆包天的混账！”邦布尔先生说到，","“Say it again, you wile, owdacious fellow!” said Mr. Bumble."
"“你怎么敢说这样的话，先生？还有你这个无礼放肆的臭女人，你怎么敢鼓励他说这种话？","“How dare you mention such a thing, sir?And how dare you encourage him, you insolent minx?"
"你倒是亲她啊！”邦布尔先生愤怒地吼着，“哼！”","Kiss her!” exclaimed Mr. Bumble, in strong indignation.“Faugh!”"
"“我并不是想要亲她啊！”诺亚嚎啕大哭，","“I didn’t mean to do it!” said Noah, blubbering."
"“她老是亲我，也不管我愿意不愿意。”","“She’s always a-kissing of me, whether I like it, or not.”"
"“哦，诺亚！”夏洛蒂委屈地叫起来。","“Oh, Noah,” cried Charlotte, reproachfully."
"“你就是，你就是！”诺厄反驳道,“她老是来这一套，先生。她摸我的下巴，对不起，先生，她还总会做出各种各样的亲热动作！”","“Yer are; yer know yer are!” retorted Noah.“She’s always a-doin’ of it, Mr. Bumble, sir; she chucks me under the chin, please, sir; and makes all manner of love!”"
"“给我安静！”邦布尔先生严厉地吼道，“夫人，你给我下楼去。诺亚，你把店门关上。你家老板回来之前，你敢再说一个字，你就没命了。等他回来，你告诉他邦布尔先生说了，要他明天吃完早饭送一口老太婆用的棺材过去。你听见了吗，先生？你倒是亲啊！”邦布尔先生举起双手，吼道,“这个教区里下等阶级的罪孽和邪恶真是太可怕了！要是议会再不考虑他们这些令人恶心的行为，这个国家就要玩完了，国民的品行也要完蛋了！”说完这些，教区执事神色傲慢、心情忧郁地踱着方步，离开了丧事承办者的铺子。","“Silence!” cried Mr. Bumble, sternly.“Take yourself downstairs, ma’am.Noah, you shut up the shop; say another word till your master comes home, at your peril; and, when he does come home, tell him that Mr. Bumble said he was to send a old woman’s shell after breakfast to-morrow morning.Do you hear sir?Kissing!” cried Mr. Bumble, holding up his hands.“The sin and wickedness of the lower orders in this porochial district is frightful!If Parliament don’t take their abominable courses under consideration, this country’s ruined, and the character of the peasantry gone for ever!”With these words, the beadle strode, with a lofty and gloomy air, from the undertaker’s premises."
"我们已经陪着他在回家的路上走了如此长一段路，那个老婆子的丧事也做好了所有准备。现在就让我们去打听一下奥利弗·特威斯特的下落，证实一下他被托比·格拉基特丢下以后，是否还躺在水沟里。","And now that we have accompanied him so far on his road home, and have made all necessary preparations for the old woman’s funeral, let us set on foot a few inquires after young Oliver Twist, and ascertain whether he be still lying in the ditch where Toby Crackit left him."
"第二十八章 寻找奥利弗，继续讲述他的遭遇","CHAPTER XXVIII Looks after Oliver, and proceeds with his adventures  "
"“让狼群咬断你们的脖子。”赛克斯喃喃低语，将牙齿咬得咯咯直响，“我真希望我能够亲眼目睹那一刻。现在你们只管喊叫吧，到时候就算你们把嗓子喊破，也难逃一死。”","“Wolves tear your throats!” muttered Sikes, grinding his teeth.“I wish I was among some of you; you’d howl the hoarser for it.”"
"赛克斯咆哮着，诅咒着，一副凶狠至极、孤注一掷的样子，还真符合他亡命之徒的本性。他曲起膝盖，把受伤的奥利弗横放在上面，迅速回头看了看身后的追兵。","As Sikes growled forth this imprecation, with the most desperate ferocity that his desperate nature was capable of, he rested the body of the wounded boy across his bended knee; and turned his head, for an instant, to look back at his pursuers."
"夜色漆黑，雾气升腾，什么东西也分辨不出来，但人们嘈杂的叫喊声依然能响彻空中。周围的狗被警报铃声惊醒了，一起叫起来；狗吠声响成一片。","There was little to be made out, in the mist and darkness; but the loud shouting of men vibrated through the air, and the barking of the neighbouring dogs, roused by the sound of the alarm bell, resounded in every direction."
"“给我站住，你这个胆小鬼！”强盗赛克斯见托比·格拉基特利用腿长的优势，把自己甩在了后面，便大声喝道，“站住！”","“Stop, you white-livered hound!” cried the robber, shouting after Toby Crackit, who, making the best use of his long legs, was already ahead. “Stop!”"
"听到第二声吆喝，托比猛地停了下来。他还没办法确定，自己是否已经脱离了手枪的射程，况且赛克斯这时候可没有心情被他耍弄。","The repetition of the word, brought Toby to a dead stand-still.For he was not quite satisfied that he was beyond the range of pistol-shot; and Sikes was in no mood to be played with."
"“过来帮把手，弄走这小子，”赛克斯怒气冲冲地冲着同伙招了招手，喊道，“回来！”","“Bear a hand with the boy,” cried Sikes, beckoning furiously to his confederate.“Come back!”"
"托比慢腾腾地转过身往回走，但是他很有胆色，还敢念念叨叨，表现出一副相当不情愿的样子。不过他说得很小声，再加上气喘吁吁，声音都显得断断续续的。","Toby made a show of returning; but ventured, in a low voice, broken for want of breath, to intimate considerable reluctance as he came slowly along."
"“快点！”赛克斯喊道。他把奥利弗放在脚下一条干枯的水沟里，然后从口袋里掏出了手枪，“别跟我耍什么花样。”","“Qicher!” cried Sikes, laying the boy in a dry ditch at his feet, and drawing a pistol from his pocket.“Don’t play booty with me.”"
"就在这个时候，嘈杂声变得更大了。赛克斯再次转头看了看，他都可以依稀辨认出，此时追兵已经在爬篱笆门了。他们翻过篱笆门就到了他所处的这片田地，更别说还有几只狗跑在他们前面。","At this moment the noise grew louder.Sikes, again looking round, could discern that the men who had given chase were already climbing the gate of the field in which he stood; and that a couple of dogs were some paces in advance of them."
"“完了，比尔！”托比喊道，“扔下这孩子，赶紧跑起来甩掉他们吧。”格拉基特先生宁愿冒吃朋友子弹的风险，也不愿落到敌人手里，毫无选择余地。说完这句临别前的忠告，他便做了个标准的向后转，全速溜走了。赛克斯咬了咬牙，又回头看了一眼，将刚才仓促裹住男孩身体的披肩往躺在地上的奥利弗身上一丢，便沿着篱笆墙跑开了。他似乎是想以此来吸引追兵的注意，把他们从奥利弗躺着的地点引开。他在篱笆墙的直角拐弯处突然停了一会儿，将手枪高高举在空中，挥舞了几个圈，然后越过篱笆墙逃走了。","“It’s all up, Bill!” cried Toby; “drop the kid, and show ’em your heels.”With this parting advice, Mr. Crackit, preferring the chance of being shot by his friend, to the certainty of being taken by his enemies, fairly turned tail, and darted off at full speed.Sikes clenched his teeth; took one look around; threw over the prostrate form of Oliver, the cape in which he had been hurriedly muffled; ran along the front of the hedge, as if to distract the attention of those behind, from the spot where the boy lay; paused, for a second, before another hedge which met it at right angles; and whirling his pistol high into the air, cleared it at a bound, and was gone."
"“喂，喂，在那儿！”一个声音在后面不安地嚷道，“平彻！内普丘恩！来这边，来这边！”","“Ho, ho, there!” cried a tremulous voice in the rear.“Pincher!Neptune!Come here, come here!”"
"这两只狗跟他们的主人一样，看上去并不是很享受这场正在进行的追逐比赛。他们欣然接受了命令。有三个男人在这块田地上已经跑出了一段距离。他们这时也停了下来，聚到一起商量了起来。","The dogs, who, in common with their masters, seemed to have no particular relish for the sport in which they were engaged, readily answered to the command.Three men, who had by this time advanced some distance into the field, stopped to take counsel together."
"“我的建议，或者至少可以说是命令吧，就是——”他们中的一个胖子说，“我们应该立刻回家。”","“My advice, or, leastways, I should say, my—orders—, is,” said the fattest man of the party, “that we ’mediately go home again.”"
"“对于贾尔斯先生的观点，我举双手赞成。”一个身材矮小但绝不瘦弱的人说道。他面色苍白，彬彬有礼——受了惊吓的人大多都是这般模样。","“I am agreeable to anything which is agreeable to Mr. Giles,” said a shorter man; who was by no means of a slim figure, and who was very pale in the face, and very polite: as frightened men frequently are."
"“绅士们，我可不希望显得没教养，”第三个人已经把狗唤回来了，他说，“贾尔斯先生肯定知道这一点。”","“I shouldn’t wish to appear ill-mannered, gentlemen,” said the third, who had called the dogs back, “Mr. Giles ought to know.”"
"“当然，”个子较矮的一人回答道，“无论贾尔斯先生说什么，我们都没有立场反对。不，不，我很清楚我的处境！感谢苍天，我清楚我的处境。”说实话，这个小个子——确实——很清楚自己的处境，也完全明白目前这绝不是一种令人满意的处境。他说话的时候，上下牙齿一直在打战。","“Certainly,” replied the shorter man; “and whatever Mr. Giles says, it isn’t our place to contradict him.No, no, I know my sitiwation!Thank my stars, I know my sitiwation.”To tell the truth, the little man—did—seem to know his situation, and to know perfectly well that it was by no means a desirable one; for his teeth chattered in his head as he spoke."
"“布里特尔斯，你害怕了吧。”贾尔斯先生说道。","“You are afraid, Brittles,” said Mr. Giles."
"“我才不怕呢。”布里特尔斯说。","“I an’t,” said Brittles."
"“你就是害怕了。”贾尔斯说。","“You are,” said Giles."
"“你这是胡说八道，贾尔斯先生。”布里特尔斯说。","“You’re a falsehood, Mr. Giles,” said Brittles."
"“你这是在扯谎，布里特尔斯。”贾尔斯先生说。","“You’re a lie, Brittles,” said Mr. Giles."
"此时此刻，贾尔斯先生的嘲弄引来了这四句你来我往的反驳。贾尔斯先生之所以作这一番嘲弄，是因为他感到气愤难当。别人用一句恭维的话作幌子，就想把回家的责任推到他的头上来。第三个人以正统的哲学方法给这场争论画上了句号。","Now, these four retorts arose from Mr. Giles’s taunt; and Mr. Giles’s taunt had arisen from his indignation at having the responsibility of going home again, imposed upon himself under cover of a compliment.The third man brought the dispute to a close, most philosophically."
"“绅士们，我来说说这到底是怎么回事。”他说，“我们都害怕了。”","“I’ll tell you what it is, gentlemen,” said he, “we’re all afraid.”"
"“先生，你是在说你自己吧。”贾尔斯先生说。在这几个人中，脸色最苍白的就数他了。","“Speak for yourself, sir,” said Mr. Giles, who was the palest of the party."
"“我是在说我自己。”这个人回答道，“在这种情况下，害怕是自然的，也是正常的。我确实是害怕了。”","“So I do,” replied the man.“It’s natural and proper to be afraid, under such circumstances.I am.”"
"“我也是。”布里特尔斯说，“根本就没必要虚张声势，指责别人害怕。”","“So am I,” said Brittles; “only there’s no call to tell a man he is, so bounceably.”"
"他承认得如此坦率，贾尔斯先生的态度也软化了下来，他立刻承认他自己也害怕了。三个人转身往回跑去，动作整齐划一，直到贾尔斯先生（在这一伙人中他最气短，而且还拖着一把干草叉）极力主张停下来，好让他对刚才的草率发言表示一下歉意。","These frank admissions softened Mr. Giles, who at once owned that-he- was afraid; upon which, they all three faced about, and ran back again with the completest unanimity, until Mr. Giles (who had the shortest wind of the party, as was encumbered with a pitchfork) most handsomely insisted on stopping, to make an apology for his hastiness of speech."
"“不过，这事真奇怪。”贾尔斯先生解释完又说，“一个人要是火气上来了，还真是什么事情都能干出来。要是我们抓到了那群流氓中的一个，我恐怕会犯谋杀罪的——我很清楚——我一定会的。”","“But it’s wonderful,” said Mr. Giles, when he had explained, “what a man will do, when his blood is up.I should have committed murder—I know I should—if we’d caught one of them rascals.”"
"另外两个人也深有同感，他们的火气跟他的一样，都消退下去了。接着，他们便开始思索，想知道是什么原因导致了他们性情上的变化。","As the other two were impressed with a similar presentiment; and as their blood, like his, had all gone down again; some speculation ensued upon the cause of this sudden change in their temperament."
"“我知道是怎么回事了，”贾尔斯先生说，“准是那个门的缘故。”","“I know what it was,” said Mr. Giles; “it was the gate.”"
"“要是门的话，我不会觉得奇怪。”布里特尔斯立马接受了这个想法，大叫起来。","“I shouldn’t wonder if it was,” exclaimed Brittles, catching at the idea."
"“你信我这话没错，”贾尔斯说，“那个门挡住了我们火气的上涌。我感觉到了，当我爬过那个门的时候，所有的火气都没了。”","“You may depend upon it,” said Giles, “that that gate stopped the flow of the excitement.I felt all mine suddenly going away, as I was climbing over it.”"
"真是无巧不成书，另外的两位也正在那一刻产生了相同的感觉，那感觉令人相当难受。因此非常明显，问题就出在那个门上，尤其是考虑到发生这一改变的时间是不存在任何疑问的。三个人此时都回想了起来，正是在这一切发生的瞬间，他们看到了那些强盗。","By a remarkable coincidence, the other two had been visited with the same unpleasant sensation at that precise moment.It was quite obvious, therefore, that it was the gate; especially as there was no doubt regarding the time at which the change had taken place, because all three remembered that they had come in sight of the robbers at the instant of its occurance."
"谈话的这三个人中，有两个是吓跑小偷的男子，还有一个是到处游走的补锅匠。当时补锅匠正在房子外的一间小屋子里睡觉。他和他的那两只杂种狗被吵醒后，也一道加入了这场追击。贾尔斯先生身兼两职。这所大房子主人是个老太太，他既是她的司膳总管，又是男管家。布里特尔斯先生则什么活都干。他从小便在老太太家做事，尽管他已经过了而立之年，至今仍被当成一个的小毛孩，只说他将来会有出息。","This dialogue was held between the two men who had surprised the burglars, and a travelling tinker who had been sleeping in an outhouse, and who had been roused, together with his two mongrel curs, to join in the pursuit.Mr. Giles acted in the double capacity of butler and steward to the old lady of the mansion; Brittles was a lad of all-work: who, having entered her service a mere child, was treated as a promising young boy still, though he was something past thirty."
"三个人用此类话语相互鼓励一番，却依旧紧紧靠在一起。每当一阵劲风刮过，树枝沙沙作响时，他们便会紧张兮兮地往四下里看一看。三个人匆匆忙忙地跑到一棵树后；他们之前把提灯留在了那里，以防灯光提示小偷该往哪个方向开火。他们抓起提灯，一路疾行向家奔去。时间过去了很久，连他们朦胧的身影也早已辨认不清了，那灯光却始终在远处摇曳闪烁，就像是从潮湿阴沉的空气里喷出的磷火一般。","Encouraging each other with such converse as this; but, keeping very close together, notwithstanding, and looking apprehensively round, whenever a fresh gust rattled through the boughs; the three men hurried back to a tree, behind which they had left their latern, lest its light should inform the thieves in what direction to fire.Catching up the light, they made the best of their way home, at a good round trot; and long after their dusky forms had ceased to be discernible, the light might have been seen twinkling and dancing in the distance, like some exhalation of the damp and gloomy atomosphere through which it was swiftly borne."
"天慢慢亮了，天气却愈加寒冷。迷雾好似一团浓厚的烟云，在地面上来回滚动。草湿漉漉的，小路上和一些低洼处全是泥水。腐臭的风夹杂着潮气，无力地吹着，发出呜呜的呻吟声。奥利弗依旧躺在赛克斯抛下他的那个地方，一动不动，毫无知觉。","The air grew colder, as day came slowly on; and the mist rolled along the ground like a dense cloud of smoke.The grass was wet; the pathways, and low places, were all mire and water; the damp breath of an unwholesome wind went languidly by, with a hollow moaning.Still, Oliver lay motionless and insensible on the spot where Sikes had left him."
"很快就到早上了。随着第一抹模糊的色彩——与其说这是白昼的新生，不如说是黑夜的死亡——在天空中发出微弱的光，空气变得更加严寒刺骨。那些在黑暗中看上去暗淡可怕的物体逐渐变得清晰起来，慢慢回复了人们熟悉的形状。雨倾盆而下，噼里啪啦地打在没有半片树叶的灌木丛上。尽管雨点落到了奥利弗身上，但他没有任何感觉。他依旧手脚摊开躺在他的泥土床上，无依无助，无知无觉。","Morning drew on apace.The air become more sharp and piercing, as its first dull hue—the death of night, rather than the birth of day—glimmered faintly in the sky.The objects which had looked dim and terrible in the darkness, grew more and more defined, and gradually resolved into their familiar shapes.The rain came down, thick and fast, and pattered noisily among the leafless bushes.But, Oliver felt it not, as it beat against him; for he still lay stretched, helpless and unconscious, on his bed of clay."
"最后，一声痛苦而低沉的哭泣打破了一直笼罩着四周的沉寂。男孩呜咽着，醒了过来。他的左臂被人用一条披肩草草地包扎了起来，笨重地垂在身旁，使不上半分力气；披肩上则浸满了鲜血。男孩浑身无力，几乎无法起身。最后，他终于坐了起来，虚弱地扭头环视了一下四周，想要向人求救，却又疼得呻吟起来。他浑身发寒，筋疲力尽，身上每一处关节都在颤抖。他挣扎着站起来，但从头到脚都在哆嗦，最后又倒回了地上。","At length, a low cry of pain broke the stillness that prevailed; and uttering it, the boy awoke.His left arm, rudely bandaged in a shawl, hung heavy and useless at his side; the bandage was saturated with blood.He was so weak, that he could scarcely raise himself into a sitting posture; when he had done so, he looked feebly round for help, and groaned with pain.Trembling in every joint, from cold and exhaustion, he made an effort to stand upright; but, shuddering from head to foot, fell prostrate on the ground."
"奥利弗刚从长时间的昏迷中醒来不久，突然觉得心里好像有什么东西爬过一般，十分恶心难受。这种感觉似乎在警告他，如果他继续躺在那里，就必死无疑。他站了起来，颤颤巍巍地尝试着走动。他头晕目眩，摇摇晃晃地向前走了几步，又向后退了几步，像极了一个醉汉。尽管如此，他还是挺了下来。他的脖子使不上力，只能把脑袋耷拉在胸前，一路上跌跌撞撞地往前走。至于究竟要去哪，他自己也不知道。","After a short return of the stupor in which he had been so long plunged, Oliver: urged by a creeping sickness at his heart, which seemed to warn him that if he lay there, he must surely die: got upon his feet, and essayed to walk.His head was dizzy, and he staggered to and fro like a drunken man.But he kept up, nevertheless, and, with his head drooping languidly on his breast, went stumbling onward, he knew not whither."
"这个时候，他困惑迷茫，诸多想法涌上了他的心头。他彷佛依旧走在赛克斯和格拉基特之间，那两个人正在愤怒地争吵——他们讲的每一句话都在他耳边回荡。为了不倒下去，他努力挣扎了一下。这时他突然清醒了过来，发现自己正在跟他们两个讲话。接着，就是他单独跟赛克斯呆在一块儿了。两人就像是前一天那样，拖着沉重的步伐往前走着。如同幻影一般的人们从他们身边走过；他能感觉到，那个强盗正紧紧地抓着他的手腕。突然，枪声响了，他往后退了几步，响亮的吵闹声和呼喊声在空中回荡，光线在他的眼前晃动。周围一片喧嚣骚动，看不见的手领着他匆匆离开。透过这些一一闪过的幻影，一种难以名状且令人不安的疼痛感不断侵蚀着他，折磨着他。","And now, hosts of bewildering and confused ideas came crowding on his mind.He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing—for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, as it were, by making some violent effort to save himself from falling, he found that he was talking to them.Then, he was alone with Sikes, plodding on as on the previous day; and as shadowy people passed them, he felt the robber’s grasp upon his wrist.Suddenly, he started back at the report of firearms; there rose into the air, loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes; all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away.Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which wearied and tormented him incessantly."
"就这样，他继续跌跌撞撞地走着，几乎毫无意识，只是茫然地从挡在他面前的大门栅栏间或者篱笆间隙间爬了过去。直到他走上一条大路，情况才有所改变。这时雨开始倾盆而下，他清醒了过来。","Thus he staggered on, creeping, almost mechanically, between the bars of gates, or through hedge-gaps as they came in his way, until he reached a road.Here the rain began to fall so heavily, that it roused him."
"他环视了一下四周，发现离他不远的地方有一个房子。如果他坚持一下，也许就能撑着走到那儿。里面的人看到他的可怜处境，或许会对他发发善心。他觉得就算他们不同情他，死在有人的地方也比做个孤魂野鬼好。为了这最后一次尝试，他使出了全身的力气，迈着蹒跚的步子朝那个房子走去。","He looked about, and saw that at no great distance there was a house, which perhaps he could reach.Pitying his condition, they might have compassion on him; and if they did not, it would be better, he thought, to die near human beings, than in the lonely open fields.He summoned up all his strength for one last trial, and bent his faltering steps towards it."
"他一步步靠近那所房子，心头升起一种似曾相识的感觉。他记不得任何细节了，但是房子的外观和朝向他好像在哪里见过。","As he drew nearer to this house, a feeling come over him that he had seen it before.He remembered nothing of its details; but the shape and aspect of the building seemed familiar to him."
"花园的围墙！昨天晚上他就是跪在围墙里面的草地上，乞求那两个人发发慈悲的。这就是他们试图抢劫的那户人家。","That garden wall!On the grass inside, he had fallen on his knees last night, and prayed the two men’s mercy.It was the very house they had attempted to rob."
"他一认出这个地方，强烈的恐惧就袭上了心头。在那一瞬间，他忘记了伤口的疼痛，想到的只有逃跑。逃跑！可他连站都站不稳。不过，就算他那年幼的小身板精力充沛，他又能逃到何处去呢？他推了推花园大门，门没有上锁，链条一下子就开了。他步履蹒跚地穿过草坪，爬上台阶，无力地敲了敲门。此时此刻，他已体力不支，靠在门廊里的一根柱子上，瘫软了下去。","Oliver felt such fear come over him when he recognised the place, that, for the instant, he forgot the agony of his wound, and thought only of flight.Flight!He could scarcely stand: and if he were in full possession of all the best powers of his slight and youthful frame, whither could he fly?He pushed against the garden-gate; it was unlocked, and swung open on its hinges.He tottered across the lawn; climbed the steps; knocked faintly at the door; and, his whole strength failing him, sunk down against one of the pillars of the little portico."
"碰巧这个时候，贾尔斯先生、布里特尔斯以及补锅匠由于昨晚劳累过度，又受了惊吓，都在厨房里用茶点，以此来恢复体力。与卑微的仆人过于亲近，向来不是贾尔斯先生的风格。他比较习惯以一种高贵而又和蔼的举止与他们相处。这既能使他们满意，又能时刻提醒他们，他的社会地位比他们高。然而，在死亡、火灾和入室抢劫面前，人人平等。所以，贾尔斯先生坐在厨房挡泥板前面，双腿伸直，左胳膊支在桌子上，右手比划着，正在向听众们仔仔细细地讲述这起抢劫案的详情。他的听众们（尤其是这一群人中的厨娘和女仆），一个个屏住呼吸，听得津津有味。","It happened that about this time, Mr. Giles, Brittles, and the tinker, were recruiting themselves, after the fatigues and terrors of the night, with tea and sundries, in the kitchen.Not that it was Mr. Giles’s habit to admit to too great familiarity the humbler servants: towards whom it was rather his wont to deport himself with a lofty affability, which, while it gratified, could not fail to remind them of his superior position in society.But, death, fires, and burglary, make all men equals; so Mr. Giles sat with his legs stretched out before the kitchen fender, leaning his left arm on the table, while, with his right, he illustrated a circumstantial and minute account of the robbery, to which his bearers (but especially the cook and housemaid, who were of the party) listened with breathless interest."
"“大约两点半左右，”贾尔斯先生说，“或者是快三点的时候吧，我也说不准。我当时醒了，在床上翻了个身，就像这样（说到这里，贾尔斯先生在椅子上转了个身，把桌布的一角扯过来搭在身上当被子），我感觉好像听到了什么声音。”","“It was about half-past two,” said Mr. Giles, “or I wouldn’t swear that it mightn’t have been a little nearer three, when I woke up, and, turning round in my bed, as it might be so, (here Mr. Giles turned round in his chair, and pulled the corner of the table-cloth over him to imitate bed-clothes,) I fancied I heerd a noise.”"
"故事讲到这时候，厨娘的脸色一下子变白了，她叫女仆把门关上。女仆转请布里特尔斯先生代劳，布里特尔斯先生又让那个补锅匠去，补锅匠假装没有听到。","At this point of the narrative the cook turned pale, and asked the housemaid to shut the door: who asked Brittles, who asked the tinker, who pretended not to hear."
"“——听到了什么声音，”贾尔斯先生继续讲，“开始的时候，我告诉自己‘这是幻觉’，正打算放松精神继续睡觉。突然，我再次听到了那个声音，这一次非常清晰。”","“—Heerd a noise,” continued Mr. Giles.“I says, at first, ‘This is illusion’; and was composing myself off to sleep, when I heerd the noise again, distinct.”"
"“什么样子的声音呢？”厨娘问。","“What sort of a noise?” asked the cook."
"“像是什么东西破了的声音。”贾尔斯先生边回答边向四周看了看。","“A kind of a busting noise,” replied Mr. Giles, looking round him."
"“更像是铁棒在肉豆蔻礤床上摩擦的声音。”布里特尔斯提出了自己的看法。","“More like the noise of powdering a iron bar on a nutmeg-grater,” suggested Brittles."
"“那是你听到的时候的声音，先生，”贾尔斯先生答道，“不过，在这个时候，还是什么东西破了的声音。我掀开了被子，”贾尔斯将桌布翻回原处，接着说道，“在床上坐了起来，又仔细听了听。”","“It was, when—you—heerd it, sir,” rejoined Mr. Giles; “but, at this time, it had a busting sound.I turned down the clothes”; continued Giles, rolling back the table-cloth, “sat up in bed; and listened.”"
"厨娘和女仆不约而同地“哦”了一声，把椅子挪得更近了些。","The cook and housemaid simultaneously ejaculated “Lor!”  and drew their chairs closer together."
"“这时候我听得非常清楚了，”贾尔斯先生继续说，“‘有人，’我心里想，‘在砸门，或者是窗户。该怎么办呢？我得把那个可怜的小家伙，也就是布里特尔斯叫醒。我得救他，免得他被人杀死在床上。要不然的话，’我想，‘他的气管说不定就让别人从右耳到左耳割了下来，而他自己却从头到尾都不知道呢。’”这时候，所有的目光都转投到布里特尔斯身上；布里特尔斯则是目瞪口呆地盯着那位讲故事的人看，满脸都是真真切切的恐惧。","“I heerd it now, quite apparent,” resumed Mr. Giles.“Somebody,” I says, “is forcing of a door, or window; what’s to be done?I’ll call up that poor lad, Brittles, and save him from being murdered in his bed; or his throat,” I says, “may be cut from his right ear to his left, without his ever knowing it.”Here, all eyes were turned upon Brittles, who fixed his upon the speaker, and stared at him, with his mouth wide open, and his face expressive of the most unmitigated horror."
"“我快速套上衣服，”贾尔斯将桌布抛开，神情严肃地盯着厨娘和女仆，“轻手轻脚地下了床，穿上一双——”“有女士在呢，贾尔斯先生。”补锅匠小声地说。","“I tossed off the clothes,” said Giles, throwing away the table-cloth, and looking very hard at the cook and housemaid, “got softly out of bed; drew on a pair of—” “Ladies present, Mr. Giles,” murmured the tinker."
"“一双鞋——，先生。”贾尔斯朝他转过脸来，在“鞋”这个字上加重了语气，“我拿起一把装足了药的手枪，这把手枪我每天都要连同餐具篮子一起拿到楼上去，然后我踮着脚尖，走进了他的房间。”“布里特尔斯，”我把他叫醒后说，“别害怕。”“你是这么说的。”布里特尔斯低声说。","“—Of—shoes—, sir,” said Giles, turning upon him, and laying great emphasis on the word; “seized the loaded pistol that always goes upstairs with the plate-basket; and walked on tiptoes to his room.”“Brittles,” I says, when I had woke him, “don’t be frightened!“So you did,” observed Brittles, in a low voice."
"“我觉得我们怕是要没命了，布里特尔斯，”贾尔斯继续说，“但是别害怕。”“他害怕了吗？”厨娘问道。","“We’re dead men, I think, Brittles,” I says, continued Giles; “but don’t be frightened.”“—Was—he frightened?” asked the cook."
"“一点也没怕。”贾尔斯回答，“他很坚强——啊！差不多跟我一样坚强。”","“Not a bit of it,” replied Mr. Giles.“He was as firm—ah! pretty near as firm as I was.”"
"“要是我的话，我保证立马就被吓死了。”女仆说。","“I should have died at once, I’m sure, if it had been me,” observed the housemaid."
"“你是妇道人家嘛。”布里特尔斯稍稍振作了一点，说道。","“You’re a woman,” retorted Brittles, plucking up a little."
"“布里特尔斯说得对极了。”贾尔斯先生点着头赞许地说道，“对于妇道人家，没什么可以期待的。我们可是男人。我们提上那盏放在布里特尔斯屋里壁炉架上的遮光灯，摸着黑走下了楼——就像这个样子。”","“Brittles is right,” said Mr. Giles, nodding his head, approvingly; “from a woman, nothing else was to be expected.We, being men, took a dark lantern that was standing on Brittle’s hob, and groped our way downstairs in the pitch dark,—as it might be so.”"
"贾尔斯先生从椅子上面站了起来，闭着眼睛走了两步，以此来给自己的描述配上恰当的动作。就在这个时候，他跟别人一样吓了一跳，急忙回到椅子上。厨娘和女仆都尖叫起来。","Mr. Giles had risen from his seat, and taken two steps with his eyes shut, to accompany his description with appropriate action, when he started violently, in common with the rest of the company, and hurried back to his chair.The cook and housemaid screamed."
"“有人敲门。”贾尔斯先生故作镇静地说道，“哪位去开开门吧。”","“It was a knock,” said Mr. Giles, assuming perfect serenity.“Open the door, somebody.”"
"没有人动。","Nobody moved."
"“看上去是件怪事，一大早就来敲门。”贾尔斯先生打量着周围一张张苍白的面孔，他自己也同样面无血色，“但是，总得有人去开门啊。听见没有，那谁？”","“It seems a strange sort of a thing, a knock coming at such a time in the morning,” said Mr. Giles, surveying the pale faces which surrounded him, and looking very blank himself; “but the door must be opened.Do you hear, somebody?”"
"贾尔斯说着，瞅了瞅布里特尔斯。这小伙子生性谦逊，也许是考虑到自己无足轻重，所以认为这个询问不可能跟自己有什么关系。总之，他没给任何回应。贾尔斯先生又向补锅匠投去请求的一眼，可是他偏偏就在这时候突然睡着了。那些妇道人家更不能指望了。","Mr. Giles, as he spoke, looked at Brittles; but that young man, being naturally modest, probably considered himself nobody, and so held that the inquiry could not have any application to him; at all events, he tendered no reply.Mr. Giles directed an appealing glance at the tinker; but he had suddenly fallen asleep.The women were out of the question."
"“要是布里特尔斯非得当着证人的面才能去开门的话，”贾尔斯先生沉默了一会儿后，说道，“我愿意去当这个证人。”","“If Brittles would rather open the door, in the presence of witnesses,” said Mr. Giles, after a short silence, “I am ready to make one.”"
"“我也愿意。”补锅匠又醒了过来，就跟他睡着一样突然。","“So am I,” said the tinker, waking up, as suddenly as he had fallen asleep."
"听完这些，布里特尔斯屈服了。大家发现（他们打开窗板得知的）天已经大亮了，这让他们稍微放心了一点。他们让狗跑在前面，一群人跟在后面走上楼去。两位女士害怕留在下面，也在后头跟了上去。根据贾尔斯的建议，大家边走边大声说话，以此来提醒外面某个起了坏心的人，他们的人数绝对占有优势。又根据同一位天才的绅士想出的妙计，他们使劲揪着狗的尾巴，让狗大声狂叫。","Brittles capitulated on these terms; and the party being somewhat re-assured by the discovery (made on throwing open the shutters) that it was now broad day, took their way upstairs; with the dogs in front.The two women, who were afraid to stay below, brought up the rear.By the advice of Mr. Giles, they all talked very loud, to warn any evil-disposed person outside, that they were strong in numbers; and by a master-stoke of policy, originating in the brain of the same ingenious gentleman, the dogs’ tails were well pinched, in the hall, to make them bark savagely."
"在采取了这几项预防措施之后，贾尔斯先生紧紧抓着补锅匠的手腕（他还亲切地说，这是怕他溜掉），命令开门。布里特尔斯照办了。这群人隔着别人的肩膀，胆怯地往外瞅着，没有看到什么可怕的东西，只有可怜的小奥利弗·特威斯特。他筋疲力尽，已经说不出话了，正努力抬起沉重的头，无声地请求他们发发慈悲。","These precautions having been taken, Mr. Giles held on fast by the tinker’s arm (to prevent his running away, as he pleasantly said), and gave the word of command to open the door.Brittles obeyed; the group, peeping timorously over each other’s shoulders, beheld no more formidable object than poor little Oliver Twist, speechless and exhausted, who raised his heavy eyes, and mutely solicited their compassion."
"“一个男孩！”贾尔斯先生大叫起来，勇敢地把补锅匠扯到了身后，“这是怎么回事——啊？——这个——布里特尔斯——你瞧——你还没明白吗？”","“A boy!” exclaimed Mr. Giles, valiantly, pushing the tinker into the background.“What’s the matter with the—eh?—Why—Brittles—look here—don’t you know?”"
"布里特尔斯之前为了开门，站到了门背后；这时他才看到奥利弗，不由得大叫了一声。贾尔斯先生抓住这个孩子的一条腿和一只胳膊（幸好不是受伤的一只），径直把他拖进了大厅里，让他全身摊开，躺在地上。","Brittles, who had got behind the door to open it, no sooner saw Oliver, than he uttered a loud cry.Mr. Giles, seizing the boy by one leg and one arm (fortunately not the broken limb) lugged him straight into the hall, and deposited him at full length on the floor thereof."
"“就是他！”贾尔斯先生非常激动地冲着楼上大喊道，“太太，抓到了一个小贼！这里有一个小贼，小姐！他还受伤了呢，小姐！是我射中了他，小姐，是布里特尔斯先生帮我提着灯。”","“Here he is!” bawled Giles, calling in a state of great excitement, up the staircase; “here’s one of the thieves, ma’am!Here’s a thief, miss!Wounded, miss!I shot him, miss; and Brittles held the light.”"
"“——用的是一盏提灯，太太。”布里特尔斯也喊了起来。他把一只手拢在嘴边，好让他的声音传得更加清楚一些。","“—In a lantern, miss,” cried Brittles, applying one hand to the side of his mouth, so that his voice might travel the better."
"两个女仆带着贾尔斯先生抓到一个小贼的消息冲上楼去，补锅匠正忙着救醒奥利弗，免得他还没来得及上绞刑架，就撑不住死了。在这一片嘈杂喧闹之中，一个甜美的女声响了起来，瞬间一切都静了下来。","The two women-servants ran upstairs to carry the intelligence that Mr. Giles had captured a robber; and the tinker busied himself in endeavouring to restore Oliver, lest he should die before he could be hanged.In the midst of all this noise and commotion, there was heard a sweet female voice, which quelled it in an instant."
"“贾尔斯！”那声音从楼梯口轻轻传来。","“Giles!” whispered the voice from the stair-head."
"“我在这，小姐。”贾尔斯先生回答，“别怕，小姐。我没怎么受伤。他也没有拼死反抗，小姐。我对付他轻而易举。”","“I’m here, miss,” replied Mr. Giles.“Don’t be frightened, miss; I ain’t much injured.He didn’t make a very desperate resistance, miss!I was soon too many for him.”"
"“嘘！”年轻的女士回答，“那些小偷吓到了姑妈，你也像他们一样要把姑妈吓坏了。这个可怜的小家伙伤得很重吧？”","“Hush!” replied the young lady; “you frighten my aunt as much as the thieves did.Is the poor creature much hurt?”"
"“伤得非常厉害，小姐。”贾尔斯先生带着难以形容的得意劲回答道。","“Wounded desperate, miss,” replied Giles, with indescribable complacency."
"“他看上去快不行了，小姐。”布里特尔斯高声喊道，那样子跟之前一模一样，“小姐，您不想来看看他？要是他真死了可就没得看了。”","“He looks as if he was a-going, miss,” bawled Brittles, in the same manner as before.“Wouldn’t you like to come and look at him, miss, in case he should?”"
"“嘘，快别嚷嚷了，行吗？要有绅士样啊！”年轻的女士回答，“安静呆着，就等一会儿，我去跟姑妈说说。”","“Hush, pray; there’s a good man!” rejoined the lady.　“Wait quietly only one instant, while I speak to aunt.”"
"说话的人轻轻地走开了，她的脚步跟她的声音一样轻柔。过了一会儿，她又回来了，吩咐把那个受伤的人小心地抬到楼上贾尔斯先生的房间去。她还吩咐布里特尔斯去替那匹小马备鞍，骑着它立刻动身去杰茨，从那里请一位警官跟一个大夫过来，再全速赶回。","With a footstep as soft and gentle as the voice, the speaker tripped away.She soon returned, with the direction that the wounded person was to be carried, carefully, upstairs to Mr. Giles’s room; and that Brittles was to saddle the pony and betake himself instantly to Chertsey: from which place, he was to despatch, with all speed, a constable and doctor."
"“但是，您不先看看他吗，小姐？”贾尔斯先生自豪地问，就像奥利弗是某种羽毛珍奇的小鸟，被他这位神枪手打下来一般，“一眼都不看吗，小姐？”","“But won’t you take one look at him, first, miss?” asked Mr. Giles, with as much pride as if Oliver were some bird of rare plumage, that he had skilfully brought down.“Not one little peep, miss?”"
"“就算要看，也决不是现在看。”年轻的女士回答道，“可怜的人！哦！对他好点，贾尔斯，看在我的面子上！”","“Not now, for the world,” replied the young lady.“Poor fellow!Oh! treat him kindly, Giles for my sake!”"
"说完，她转身离开了。老管家抬头看着她，眼神中充满了自豪和钦佩，就好像她是他自己的孩子一样。然后，他朝着奥利弗俯下身去，带着女性般的爱护和关怀，帮忙将他抬到了楼上。","The old servant looked up at the speaker, as she turned away, with a glance as proud and admiring as if she had been his own child.Then, bending over Oliver, he helped to carry him upstairs, with the care and solicitude of a woman."
"第二十九章 介绍奥利弗投靠的这一大家子的情况","CHAPTER XXIX Has an introductory account of the inmates of the house, to which Oliver resorted. "
"尽管屋内陈设样式老旧，注重舒适却毫无时下流行的典雅气息，但还算得上是一间美观的屋子。两位女士正坐在餐桌前，桌子上摆着丰盛的早餐。贾尔斯先生穿着全套黑礼服，正在侍奉她们用餐；他的着装一丝不苟，穿衣时显然下了一番功夫。他站在餐具架和餐桌之间的某个位置。他的身体笔直立着，头向后仰，只稍稍向旁边偏了一点；左腿在前，右手插在背心里，而左手则是贴在身边，紧握着托盘：一看就知道这是一个对自己功绩和地位感觉良好，并带着这种感觉服务他人的人。","In a handsome room: though its furniture had rather the air of old-fashioned comfort, than of modern elegance: there sat two ladies at a well-spread breakfast-table. Mr. Giles, dressed with scrupulous care in a full suit of black, was in attendance upon them.He had taken his station some half-way between the side-board and the breakfast-table; and, with his body drawn up to its full height, his head thrown back, and inclined the merest trifle on one side, his left leg advanced, and his right hand thrust into  his waist-coat, while his left hung down by his side, grasping a waiter, looked like one who laboured under a very agreeable sense of his own merits and importance."
"两位女士中，一位年事已高。不过她腰板挺直，连她坐的那把高背橡木椅都比她不过。她的穿着极其考究精致，旧式服饰中流露出少许对流行品味的让步。这流行元素不但无损于旧式格调，反而起到了令人愉快的点缀作用。她坐在那里，举止端庄，双手交叉着放在身前的桌子上。她的眼神（这眼神几乎丝毫没有因岁月流逝而有失明亮）仔细地凝视着与她同桌的那位年轻的女士。","Of the two ladies, one was well advanced in years; but the high-backed oaken chair in which she sat, was not more upright than she.Dressed with the utmost nicety and precision, in a quaint mixture of by—gone costume, with some slight concessions to the prevailing taste, which rather served to point the old style pleasantly than to impair its effect, she sat, in a stately manner, with her hands folded on the table before her.Her eyes (and age had dimmed but little of their brightness) were attentively upon her young companion."
"年轻女士青春焕发，正值妙龄。如果说真有天使持着上帝美好的愿望投胎到人间，那她们一定跟她形容相仿；这样想丝毫不会亵渎神灵。","The younger lady was in the lovely bloom and spring-time of womanhood; at that age, when, if ever angels be for God’s good purposes enthroned in mortal forms, they may be, without impiety, supposed to abide in such as hers."
"她不到十七岁。气质却如此纤细优美、温文尔雅、纯洁美丽，彷佛这个世间不是她的容身之处，而凡间的俗物也都不是她的同类一般。智慧在她那深邃的蓝眼睛中闪烁，在她高贵的额头上展现；对于她的年龄来说，拥有如此智慧极为难得，甚至在整个人世间都极其罕见。还有她那甜美可爱的丰富表情，那照亮整个面庞没留下一丝阴影的光辉，那最为宝贵的微笑，那洋溢着快乐与幸福的微笑——这一切的一切都营造了家庭的温馨、炉火边的安逸以及常驻心间的幸福。","She was not past seventeen.Cast in so slight and exquisite a mould; so mild and gentle; so pure and beautiful; that earth seemed not her element, nor its rough creatures her fit companions.The very intelligence that shone in her deep blue eye, and was stamped upon her noble head, seemed scarcely of her age, or of the world; and yet the changing expression of sweetness and good humour, the thousand lights that played about the face, and left no shadow there; above all, the smile, the cheerful, happy smile, were made for Home, and fireside peace and happiness."
"她匆忙地打理着餐桌旁的种种琐事。她偶尔抬头，发现老太太正目不转睛地看着自己。她便调皮地把前额上简单编过的头发往后撩一下，嫣然一笑，流露出脉脉温情和不加雕琢的可爱。就连神灵看到了这一刻，都会对她低首微笑的。","She was busily engaged in the little offices of the table.Chancing to raise her eyes as the elder lady was regarding her, she playfully put back her hair, which was simply braided on her forehead; and threw into her beaming look, such an expression of affection and artless loveliness, that blessed spirits might have smiled to look upon her."
"“布里特尔斯动身一个多小时了，是吗？”老太太顿了顿，而后问道。","“And Brittles has been gone upwards of an hour, has he?” and the old lady, after a pause."
"“一小时十二分钟了，太太。”贾尔斯先生拉住一条黑缎表带，看了看一块银制怀表，回答道。","“An hour and twelve minutes, ma’am,” replied Mr. Giles, referring to a silver watch, which he drew forth by a black ribbon."
"“他老是慢吞吞的。”老太太说。","“He is always slow,” remarked the old lady."
"“布里特尔斯向来都是个行动迟缓的孩子，太太。”管家附和道。顺便说一句，布里特尔斯三十多年来一直都是个行动迟缓的小伙子。所以说，若想要他做事麻利起来，看来已经没有多大可能了。","“Brittles always was a slow boy, ma’am,” replied the attendant.And seeing, by the bye, that Brittles had been a slow boy for upwards of thirty years, there appeared no great probability of his ever being a fast one."
"“我觉得他不仅没变快，倒是越来越慢了。”老太太说。","“He gets worse instead of better, I think,” said the elder lady."
"“要是他停下来跟别的男孩子玩，那才不可原谅呢。”年轻女士微笑着说。","“It is very inexcusable in him if he stops to play with any other boys,” said the young lady, smiling."
"贾尔斯先生显然正在琢磨，自己此时恭敬地微笑一下是否得体。就在这时候，一辆双轮马车行驶到了花园门前，车上跳下来一位胖胖的绅士。他以一种让人难以理解的方式迅速走进了门，然后闯入房间，差点把贾尔斯先生和整桌早餐一起撞翻。","Mr. Giles was apparently considering the propriety of indulging in a respectful smile himself, when a gig drove up to the garden-gate: out of which there jumped a fat gentleman, who ran straight up to the door: and who, getting quickly into the house by some mysterious process, burst into the room, and nearly overturned Mr. Giles and the breakfast-table together."
"“我从来没听说过这种事情！”胖胖的绅士大声叫道，“亲爱的梅莱太太——上帝保佑——而且还是在夜深人静的时候，我——从来没有——听过这种事情！”","“I never heard of such a thing!” exclaimed the fat gentleman.“My dear Mrs. Maylie—bless my soul—in the silence of the night, too—I—never—heard of such a thing!”"
"胖先生一边说着安慰话，一边跟两位女士握手。他拖来一把椅子，询问她们感觉如何。","With these expressions of condolence, the fat gentleman shook hands with both ladies, and drawing up a chair, inquired how they found themselves."
"“您会丢了性命的，肯定会被吓死的。”胖绅士说，“您干嘛不派人送个信呢？上帝保佑，我的人一分钟之内就可以赶到，我也是。我敢保证，在这种情形下，我的人，或是任何人，都会乐意帮忙的。天呢，天呢！真是没想到呢！而且还是发生在夜深人静的时候呢！”","“You ought to be dead; positively dead with the fright,” said the fat gentleman.“Why didn’t you send?Bless me, my man should have come in a minute; and so would I; and my assistant would have been delighted; or anybody, I’m sure, under such circumstances.Dear, dear!So unexpected!In the silence of the night, too!”"
"对这起抢劫案出人意料且是夜间作案这一事实，这位医生似乎感到格外困惑和不安。就好像是按照惯例，干入室抢劫这一行的绅士们应该白天动手，而且还会提前一两天发封信来预约一下似的。","The doctor seemed expecially troubled by the fact of the robbery having been unexpected, and attempted in the night-time; as if it were the established custom of gentlemen in the housebreaking way to transact business at noon, and to make an appointment, by post, a day or two previous."
"“还有您，罗丝小姐，”大夫说着转向那位年轻女士，“我——”","“And you, Miss Rose,” said the doctor, turning to the young lady, “I—” "
"“哦！太不可思议了，确实如此。”罗丝打断他说道，“不过楼上有个可怜的小家伙，姑妈希望您去看看。”","“Oh! very much so, indeed,” said Rose, interrupting him; “but there is a poor creature upstairs, whom aunt wishes you to see.”"
"“啊！当然，”大夫回答，“我差点给忘了。据我所知，那是你干的吧，贾尔斯。”","“Ah! to be sure,” replied the doctor, “so there is.That was your handiwork, Giles, I understand.”"
"贾尔斯先生正紧张地把茶杯整理好，他涨红了脸说，做了这事是他的荣幸。","Mr. Giles, who had been feverishly putting the tea-cups to rights, blushed very red, and said that he had had that honour."
"“荣幸，嗯？”大夫说，“这个，我可不明白，也许在后面厨房里打中了一个小贼，就跟在十二步以外打中你的对手一样荣幸吧。贾尔斯，来想象一下。他也开了一枪，只是射偏了，那你就是参加了一场决斗啊。”","“Honour, eh?” said the doctor; “well, I don’t know; perhaps it’s as honourable to hit a thief in a back kitchen, as to hit your man at twelve paces.Fancy that he fired in the air, and you’ve  fought a duel, Giles.”"
"贾尔斯先生认为，大夫对事情这样轻描淡写地处理，对自己并不公平，更会有损自己的荣誉。于是他恭恭敬敬地答道，事情并非他这样的人可以判断的。他倒是觉得对这场决斗的另一方来说，这可不是闹着玩的事。","Mr. Giles, who thought this light treatment of the matter an unjust attempt at diminishing his glory, answered respectfully, that it was not for the like of him to judge about that; but he rather thought it was no joke to the opposite party."
"“天呢，这倒是真的！”大夫说道，“他在哪里呢？带我去看看。我下来的时候，会再替你们检查一下，梅莱太太。这就是那个他钻进来的小窗户吧，嗯？哎，我真的无法相信！”","“Gad, that’s true!”said the doctor.“Where is he?Show me the way.I’ll look in again, as I come down, Mrs. Maylie.That’s the little window that he got in at, eh?Well, I couldn’t have believed it!”"
"他跟着贾尔斯先生走上楼去，一路上都在絮絮叨叨。趁他上楼这段时间，也许可以向读者交代一下情况。这位罗斯伯力先生是附近一位外科医生，是方圆十英里之内赫赫有名的“大夫”。他已经发福了许多，这点与其说是因为生活富裕，倒不如说是因为他天性幽默乐观。他为人友好，待人热心，还是个性情古怪的老光棍。任何一位在世的探险家都得搜索比此地大五倍的地方，才能找到他这样一个人物。","Talking all the way, he followed Mr. Giles upstairs; and while he is going upstairs, the reader may be informed, that Mr. Losberne, a surgeon in the neighbourhood, known through a circuit of ten miles round as “the doctor,” had grown fat, more from good-humour than from good living: and was as kind and hearty, and withal as eccentric an old bachelor, as will be found in five times that space, by any explorer alive."
"大夫在楼上呆的时间很长，远远多于他本人和两位女士的预想。一个大而扁的箱子从马车里取了出来，房间里频频传出铃声，仆人们不停地跑上跑下。根据这些完全可以推断出，某件重要的事情正在楼上进行着。最后，大夫走了下来。别人焦急地询问病人的情况，他却显得非常神秘。他小心翼翼地关上了门，这才开始作答：","The doctor was absent, much longer than either he or the ladies had anticipated.A large flat box was fetched out of the gig; and a bedroom bell was rung very often; and the servants ran up and down stairs perpetually; from which tokens it was justly concluded that something important was going on above.At length he returned; and in reply to an anxious inquiry after his patient; looked very mysterious, and closed the door, carefully."
"“这件事情非同寻常，梅莱太太。”大夫说话的时候背对着房间门，彷佛是为了确保门一直紧闭着，","“This is a very extraordinary thing, Mrs. Maylie,” said the doctor, standing with his back to the door, as if to keep it shut."
"“我希望他已经脱离危险了，是吧？”老太太询问。","“He is not in danger, I hope?” said the old lady."
"“咳，在这个情形下，这事也不算离奇。”大夫回答说，“尽管我认为他还没有脱离危险。你们见过这个小偷吗？”","“Why, that would—not—be an extraordinary thing, under the circumstances,” replied the doctor; “though I don’t think he is.Have you seen the thief?”"
"“没有。”老太太回答。","“No,” rejoined the old lady."
"“也没听说过任何关于他的事情？”","“Nor heard anything about him?”"
"“没有。”","“No.”"
"“请原谅我，太太。”贾尔斯先生插话说，“罗斯伯力大夫来的时候，我正要告诉您关于这个贼的事情。”","“I beg your pardon, ma’am, ” interposed Mr. Giles; “but I was going to tell you about him when Doctor Losberne came in.”"
"事实上，贾尔斯先生一开始并没有足够的勇气，承认自己打中的仅仅是个孩子。他的勇敢赢得了那么多的称赞，就算他拼尽全力，也克制不住自己为了那美妙的几分钟将解释推迟。这几分钟里，他临危不惧、勇猛无敌的好名声会依旧处于风光无限的巅峰之上。","The fact was, that Mr. Giles had not, at first, been able to bring his mind to the avowal, that he had only shot a boy.Such commendations had been bestowed upon his bravery, that he could not, for the life of him, help postponing the explanation for a few delicious minutes; during which he had flourished, in the very zenith of a brief reputation for undaunted courage."
"“罗丝想要看看那个人，”梅莱太太说，“我没有答应。”","“Rose wished to see the man,” said Mrs. Maylie, “but I wouldn’t hear of it.”"
"“哼！”大夫回答，“他外貌倒是没有什么惊人之处。我陪着你们去看看他，您不会反对吧？”","“Humph!” rejoined the doctor.“There is nothing very alarming in his appearance.Have you any objection to see him in my presence?”"
"“如果必要的话，”老太太回答，“当然不反对。”","“If it be necessary,” replied the old lady, “certainly not.”"
"“我觉得很有必要。”大夫说，“总之，我非常确定，如果您迟迟不去看他，将来肯定会后悔的。他现在非常安静，正舒舒服服地躺着。请允许我——罗丝小姐，请允许我可以吗？您一点也不会害怕，我用我的荣誉发誓！”","“Then I think it is necessary,” said the doctor; “at all events, I am quite sure that you would deeply regret not having done so, if you postponed it.He is perfectly quiet and comfortable now.Allow me—Miss Rose, will you permit me?Not the slightest fear, I pledge you my honour!”"
"第三十章 讲述前来探望奥利弗的人对他的印象","CHAPTER XXX Relates what Oliver’s new visitors thought of him"
"大夫啰啰嗦嗦，一次又一次保证，说她们看到这个罪犯后肯定会大吃一惊。他让年轻的小姐挽着他的胳膊，又把自己另一只手递给梅莱太太，然后彬彬有礼、威严庄重地带着她们走上楼去。","With many loquacious assurances that they would be agreeably surprised in the aspect of the criminal, the doctor drew the young lady’s arm through one of his; and offering his disengaged hand to Mrs. Maylie, led them, with much ceremony and stateliness, upstairs."
"“现在，”大夫轻轻转动卧室的门把手，低声说道，“说说你们对他的印象吧。他有些时候没理发了，尽管如此，看上去也不是那么吓人。还是先等等！让我先去看看现在可不可以探视他。”","“Now,” said the doctor, in a whisper, as he softly turned the handle of a bedroom-door, “let us hear what you think of him.He has not been shaved very recently, but he don’t look at all ferocious notwithstanding.Stop, though!Let me first see that he is in visiting order.”"
"他上前了几步，朝屋子里看了看。然后他示意她们跟上来。等她们进了门后，大夫便把门关上，又轻轻地撩开了挂在床边的帘子。在床上，并非如她们所预想的那样，躺着一个顽固凶煞的恶棍，而只是一个小孩子。他受伤痛折磨，疲惫不堪，已陷入沉睡之中。他胳膊受了伤，正缠着绷带，并用夹板固定着放在胸前。头向另一只胳膊上倾斜着，长长的头发散落在枕头上，遮住了这条胳膊的一半。","Stepping before them, he looked into the room.Motioning them to advance, he closed the door when they had entered; and gently drew back the curtains of the bed.Upon it, in lieu of the dogged, black-visaged ruffian they had expected to behold, there lay a mere child: worn with pain and exhaustion, and sunk into a deep sleep.His wounded arm, bound and splintered up, was crossed upon his breast; his head reclined upon the other arm, which was half hidden by his long hair, as it streamed over the pillow."
"这位正直的先生手拉床帘看了一分钟左右，没有说一句话。正当他端详着病人的时候，年轻的女士静静地走了过来，坐在床边的椅子上，把奥利弗脸上的头发撩到了一边。她朝他俯下身去，她的眼泪一滴一滴落到了他的额头上。","The honest gentleman held the curtain in his hand, and looked on, for a minute or so, in silence.Whilst he was watching the patient thus, the younger lady glided softly past, and seating herself in a chair by the bedside, gathered Oliver’s hair from his face.As she stooped over him, her tears fell upon his forehead."
"孩子动了一下，在睡梦中笑了，就如同这些怜悯与同情的印记唤起了某个充满温情与爱意的甜蜜美梦一般，这是他之前从未感觉到的。就像这样，一首温和的曲子，一处平静水面泛起的涟漪，一朵花儿的芬芳，或者是提起的一个熟悉的字眼，有时候都会突然唤起对一些场景的模糊记忆，而这些场景都是今生从未见过的。那些回忆会像微风一般飘散不见，而发生在很久之前的快乐往事却会在回忆中被短暂唤起。平日里无论你怎样努力回想，这些往事是不会浮现在你脑海中的。","The boy stirred, and smiled in his sleep, as though these marks of pity and compassion had awakened some pleasant dream of a love and affection he had never known.Thus, a strain of gentle music, or the rippling of water in a silent place, or the odour of a flower, or the mention of a familiar word, will sometimes call up sudden dim remembrances of scenes that never were, in this life;which vanish like a breath; which some brief memory of a happier existence, long gone by, would seem to have awakened; which no voluntary exertion of the mind can ever recall."
"“这是怎么回事？”老太太大声说，“这个可怜的孩子不可能是那群强盗的徒弟！”","“What can this mean?” exclamied the elder lady.“This poor child can never have been the pupil of robbers!”"
"“邪恶，”大夫一边放下帘子一边说，“在许多神殿中都可以逗留，谁敢说它不会藏在这漂亮的外表之下呢？”","“Vice,” said the surgeon, replacing the curtain, “takes up her abode in many temples; and who can say that a fair outside shell not enshrine her?”"
"“但是他多小啊！”罗丝坚持说。","“But at so early an age!” urged Rose."
"“我亲爱的小姐，”大夫悲伤地摇摇头，说道，“罪行，与死亡别无二致，并不是只跟年老体弱的人有关啊。最年轻、最漂亮的人，也常常可以成为被选中的牺牲品啊。”","“My dear young lady,” rejoined the surgeon, mournfully shaking his head; “crime, like death, is not confined to the old and withered alone.The youngest and fairest are too often its chosen victims.”"
"“但是，你能——哦！你能够相信，这样一个病弱的孩子，竟然自愿做那些社会败类的帮凶吗？”罗丝说。","“But, can you—oh! can you really believe that this delicate boy has been the voluntary associate of the worst outcasts of society?” said Rose."
"大夫摇摇头，用这一方式暗示他担心这点完全有可能。他注意到他们可能会打扰到病人，于是便带头走进了隔壁房间。","The surgeon shook his head, in a manner which intimated that he feared it was very possible; and observing that they might disturb the patient, led the way into an adjoining apartment."
"“不过就算他是邪恶的，”罗丝穷追不舍，“想想他多么小啊。你想想，或许他从来都没有得到过妈妈的爱，也未感受过家的温暖。虐待、殴打、生计所迫，都可能使他跟那些逼他干坏事的人混到一起。姑妈，亲爱的姑妈，发发慈悲吧，在他们把这个病着的孩子押进监狱之前，您可一定要想一想啊。他要是一进监狱，所有改正的机会可就全没了。","“But even if he has been wicked,” pursued Rose, “think how young he is; think that he may never have known a mother’s love, or the comfort of a home; that ill-usage and blows, or the want of bread, may have driven him to herd with men who have forced him to guilt.Aunt, dear aunt, for mercy’s sake, think of this, before you let them drag this sick child to a prison, which in any case must be the grave of all his chances of amendment."
"哦！您爱我，您知道，因为您的仁慈与关爱，我从来没有感觉到自己失去了父母。我本来也可能会做错事，跟这个可怜的孩子一样无依无靠、无人救助。趁着现在还来得及，您就可怜可怜他吧。”","Oh! as you love me, and know that I have never felt the want of parents in your goodness and affection, but that I might have done so, and might have been equally helpless and unprotected with this poor child, have pity upon him before it is too late!”"
"“亲爱的，”老太太说着把这个哭泣的姑娘揽在了怀里，“你觉得我会伤害他一根头发吗？”","“My dear love,” said the elder lady, as she folded the weeping girl to her bosom, “do you think I would harm a hair of his head?”"
"“不，不会的！”罗丝急切地回答。","“Oh, no!” replied Rose, eagerly."
"“不会，当然不会。”老太太说，“我的日子所剩无几了，同情别人就等于宽恕自己！我怎样做才能救他呢，先生？”","“No, surely,” said the old lady; “my days are drawing to their close: and may mercy be shown to me as I show it to others!What can I do to save him, sir?”"
"“让我想想，太太。”大夫说，“让我想想。”","“Let me think, ma’am,” said the doctor; “let me think.”"
"罗斯伯力先生把双手插在口袋里，在房间里来回走动，时而停下来，用脚尖调整一下平衡；他眉头紧皱，样子十分吓人。他发出各种各样的感慨，比如“我想到了”“不，还没呢”一类的话，而且还反复地走动，不停地皱眉头。最后，他终于停了下来，说了下面这番话：","Mr. Losberne thrust his hands into his pockets, and took several turns up and down the room; often stopping, and balancing himself on his toes, and frowning frightfully.After various exclamations of “I’ve  got it now” and “no, I haven’t,” and as many renewals of the walking and frowning, he at length made a dead halt, and spoke as follows: "
"“我认为，只要您能全权委托我去威胁贾尔斯先生和布里特尔斯那个小伙子，我就能做到。我知道贾尔斯是个忠诚的老仆人，不过您有上千种方法来补偿他。除此以外，您还可以对他这样一个好射手进行一下褒奖。您不反对这么做吧？”","“I think if you give me a full and unlimited commission to bully Giles, and that little boy, Brittles, I can manage it.Giles is a faithful fellow and an old servant, I know; but you can make it up to him in a thousand ways, and reward him for being such a good shot besides.You don’t object to that?”"
"“除非您还有别的保护这个孩子的方法。”梅莱太太说道。","“Unless there is some other way of preserving the child,” replied Mrs. Maylie."
"“除此之外，别无他法。”大夫说，“别无他法，相信我吧。”","“There is no other,” said the doctor.“No other, take my word for it.”"
"“这样的话，姑妈就全权委托你了。”罗丝笑着说，脸上还挂着眼泪，“不过，除非情势所迫，请您千万不要过分为难那两个可怜的人。”","“Then my aunt invests you with full power,” said Rose, smiling through her tears; “but pray don’t be harder upon the poor fellows than is indispensably necessary.”"
"“您似乎认为，”大夫回答说，“今天在场的各位都是铁石心肠，只有您自己例外，罗丝小姐。我只希望，为了成长中的众多男性着想，当第一个有资格的年轻人寻求您的怜悯时，你能够像现在一样心存仁厚。我多希望我也是一个年轻人，那样我就有了优势，可以捉住眼前这样一个有利的机会。”","“You seem to think,” retorted the doctor, “that everybody is disposed to be hard-hearted to-day, except yourself, Miss Rose.I only hope, for the sake of the rising male sex generally, that you may be found in as vulnerable and soft-hearted a mood by the first eligible young fellow who appeals to your compassion; and I wish I were a young fellow, that I might avail myself, on he spot, of such a favourable opportunity for doing so, as the present.”"
"“您也是个大孩子，跟可怜的布里特尔斯一样。”罗丝红着脸说。","“You are as great a boy as poor Brittles himself,” returned Rose, blushing."
"“是啊，”大夫开怀地笑了起来，“这不是什么难办的事情。不过还是先谈谈这个男孩吧。咱们还没说到协议的重要部分呢。我保证，他再过一个小时左右就会醒了。尽管我已经嘱咐过楼下那个一根筋的警察老兄，说这个孩子现在不能说话也不能挪动，否则会要了他的命。不过我想我们还是可以跟他谈谈的，不会有什么危险。现在，咱们做这样一个约定——我当着你们的面审问他，如果我们根据他的话作出判断，并且我能让你们通过冷静的推理，看清楚他本来就是一个十足的恶棍（这种可能性比较大）。那样的话，他就只能听天由命了，无论怎样，我也不会再管这事了。”","“Well,” said the doctor, laughing heartily, “that is no very difficult matter.But to return to this boy.The great point of our agreement is yet to come.He will wake in an hour or so, I dare say; and although I have told that thick-headed constable-fellow downstairs that he musn’t be moved or spoken to, on peril of his life, I think we may converse with him without danger.Now I make this stipulation—that I shall examine him in your presence, and that, if, from what he says, we judge, and I can show to the satisfaction of your cool reason, that he is a real and thorough bad one (which is more than possible), he shall be left to his fate, without any farther interference on my part, at all events.”"
"“哦，不，姑妈！”罗丝恳求道。","“Oh no, aunt!” entreated Rose."
"“哦，就是这样，姑妈！”大夫说，“这是讨价还价吗？”","“Oh yes, aunt!” said the doctor.“Is is a bargain?”"
"“他不会沦为一个坏蛋的，”罗丝说，“这不可能的。”","“He cannot be hardened in vice,” said Rose; “It is impossible.”"
"“很好，”大夫反驳道，“那样的话，你就更有理由接受我的建议了。”","“Very good,” retorted the doctor; “then so much the more reason for acceding to my proposition.”"
"最后，协议就这样缔结了。几个人都坐了下来，耐着性子等着奥利弗清醒过来。","Finally the treaty was entered into; and the parties thereunto sat down to wait, with some impatience, until Oliver should awake."
"两位女士的耐性注定要接受长时间的考验，这考验比罗斯伯力先生为她们估算的还要长久。时间一小时一小时地过去了，奥利弗依旧沉睡着。事实上，直到黄昏时分，这位好心的大夫才给她们带来了消息。他说奥利弗终于醒了过来，而且神智足够清醒，可以跟他谈一谈了。大夫又说，这个男孩病得非常严重，还因失血而变得非常虚弱。不过他此时心中忐忑不安，急切地想要找人倾诉一些事情。大夫认为最好现在能给他这个机会，而不是坚持让他保持安静，留到等到明早再说；反正无论早晚，这些话总是要说的。","The patience of the two ladies was destined to undergo a longer trial than Mr. Losberne had led them to expect; for hour after hour passed on, and still Oliver slumbered heavily.It was evening, indeed, before the kind-hearted doctor brought them the intelligence, that he was at length sufficiently restored to be spoken to.The boy was very ill, he said, and weak from the loss of blood; but his mind was so troubled with anxiety to disclose something, that he deemed it better to give him the opportunity, than to insist upon his remaining quiet until next morning: which he should otherwise have done."
"这次谈话持续了很长时间。奥利弗向他们诉说了他简单的身世。他疼痛难忍，浑身无力，中间不得不经常停下来。在这样一个昏暗的房间里，听一个生病的孩子用虚弱的声音讲述那些铁石心肠的人带给他的不可胜数的伤害和灾难，真是一件庄严肃穆的事情。哦！如果我们压制折磨自己的同类时，能够想一下，那些如同乌云一般浓密厚重的人类犯罪证据，尽管上升地十分缓慢，但是最终还是会到达天堂，然后把恶报施加到人类头上。如果我们能够在想象中，哪怕只有短短一刻，听一下死者发出的证言，那些任何力量也无法镇压，任何尊严也无法封锁的证言，那么那些日常生活中的伤害、不公正、痛苦、不幸、残忍和错误，哪里还有容身之地？","The conference was a long one.Oliver told them all his simple history, and was often compelled to stop, by pain and want of strength.It was a solemn thing, to hear, in the darkened room, the feeble voice of the sick child recounting a weary catalogue of evils and calamities which hard men had brought upon him.Oh! if when we oppress and grind our fellow-creatures, we bestowed but one thought on the dark evidences of human error, which, like dense and heavy clouds, are rising, slowly it is true, but not less surely, to Heaven, to pour their after-vengeance on our heads;if we heard but one instant, in imagination, the deep testimony of dead men’s voices, which no power can stifle, and no pride shut out; where would be the injury and injustice, the suffering, misery, cruelty, and wrong, that each day’s life brings with it!"
"当天夜里，奥利弗的枕头被一双双温柔的手抚平，美与善看护着他进入了梦乡。他感到平静，感到幸福，就是死去也无怨无憾。","Oliver’s pillow was smoothed by gentle hands that night; and loveliness and virtue watched him as he slept.He felt calm and happy, and could have died without a murmur."
"这场重要的谈话刚刚结束。一等到奥利弗平静下来再次入睡，大夫就立刻揉了揉眼睛，责怪这双眼睛怎么突然不管用了。然后他站起身来，走到楼下去做贾尔斯的思想工作了。他发现客厅里里外外连个人影也没有。这时他突然想到，在厨房里开始这一工作效果可能会更好，于是他又走进了厨房。","The momentous interview was no sooner concluded, and Oliver composed to rest again, than the doctor, after wiping his eyes, and condemning them for being weak all at once, betook himself downstairs to open upon Mr. Giles.And finding nobody about the parlours, it occurred to him, that he could perhaps originate the proceedings with better effect in the kitchen; so into the kitchen he went."
"在这个家庭议会的下议院里，集合起来出席会议的有：女仆们、布里特尔斯先生、贾尔斯先生、补锅匠（考虑到他作了不少贡献，特意邀请他在当天剩下的时间前来享受盛情款待），还有那位警官。最后提到的那位绅士长着一个很大的脑袋，五官也都很大，穿着大号的半筒靴，还配着一根粗大的警棍；看起来他好像很享受那份相应份额的啤酒——事实也确实如此。","There were assembled, in that lower house of the domestic parliament, the women-servants, Mr. Brittles, Mr. Giles, the tinker (who had received a special invitation to regale himself for the remainder of the day, in consideration of his services), and the constable.The latter gentleman had a large staff, a large head, large features, and large half-boots; and he looked as if he had been taking a proportionate allowance of ale—as indeed he had."
"前一天夜里异乎寻常的经历依旧是讨论的话题。大夫进门的时候，贾尔斯先生正在详细讲述他当时是如何临危不惧；布里特尔斯先生则手持一杯啤酒，没等他的上级把话说完，就开口作证，担保他说的每一句都是真话。","The adventures of the previous night were still under discussion; for Mr. Giles was expatiating upon his presence of mind, when the doctor entered; Mr. Brittles, with a mug of ale in his hand, was corroborating everything, before his superior said it."
"“都坐好了！”大夫挥挥手，说道。","“Sit still!” said the doctor, waving his hand."
"“谢谢您，先生。”贾尔斯先生说，“太太和小姐吩咐给大家喝点儿啤酒。我想也没必要老是呆在自己的小屋子里，所以就来这儿陪陪大家了。”","“Thank you, sir,” said Mr. Giles.“Misses wished some ale to be given out, sir; and as I felt no ways inclined for my own little room, sir, and was disposed for company, I am taking mine among ’em here.”"
"布里特尔斯带头，在场女士先生们也都很知趣地跟着低声咕哝了几句，对贾尔斯先生屈身俯就大驾光临表示领情。贾尔斯先生则带着一种高人一等的姿态环视四周，好像在说只要他们表现良好，他是不会忽视他们的。","Brittles headed a low murmur, by which the ladies and gentlemen generally were understood to express the gratification they derived from Mr. Giles’s condescension.Mr. Giles looked round with a patronising air, as much as to say that so long as they behaved properly, he would never desert them."
"“先生，病人今天晚上情况如何？”贾尔斯问。","“How is the patient to-night, sir?” asked Giles."
"“就那样吧。”大夫回答，“贾尔斯先生，恐怕你惹到麻烦了。”","“So-so”; returned the doctor.“I am afraid you have got yourself into a scrape there, Mr. Giles.”"
"“先生，我希望您不是想说，”贾尔斯打着哆嗦说，“他快要死了。我只要一想到这件事，这一辈子都不会再开心了。我不想打死一个孩子。不，就连布里特尔斯也不会想的。就算把全郡所有的盘子都给我，我也下不了手，先生。”","“I hope you don’t mean to say, sir,” said Mr. Giles, trembling, “that he’s going to die.If I thought it, I should never be happy again.I wouldn’t cut a boy off: no, not even Brittles here; not for all the plate in the county, sir.”"
"“这不是重点。”大夫故弄玄虚地说，“贾尔斯先生，你是个新教徒吧？”","“That’s not the point,” said the doctor, mysteriously.“Mr. Giles, are you a Protestant?”"
"“是啊，先生，我希望是的。”贾尔斯先生面色苍白，支支吾吾地说。","“Yes, sir, I hope so,” faltered Mr. Giles, who had turned very pale."
"“那么——你呢，孩子？”大夫突然转向布里特尔斯，问道。","“And what are— you—, boy?” said the doctor, turning sharply upon Brittles."
"“上帝保佑，先生！”布里特尔斯猛地跳了起来，“我跟贾尔斯先生一样，先生。”","“Lord bless me, sir!” replied Brittles, starting violently; “I’m the same as Mr. Giles, sir.”"
"“那你们告诉我，”大夫说，“你们俩，你们两个人！你们能够发誓，楼上的那个男孩，就是昨天晚上给人从小窗户里塞进来的那个小男孩吗？说啊！快说啊！我们都在等着你们开口呢！”","“Then tell me this,” said the doctor, “both of you, both of you!Are you going to take upon yourselves to swear, that that boy upstairs is the boy that was put through the little window last night?Out with it!Come!We are prepared for you!”"
"大夫被公认为是这个世界上脾气最好的生物之一。但是这位大夫竟然用这样一种可怕又充满愤怒的口气，提出这样的询问。贾尔斯先生和布里特尔斯先生之前喝过点啤酒，本来就挺兴奋，头脑还有些混沌不清，此时更是茫然无措、面面相觑。","The doctor, who was universally considered one of the best-tempered creatures on earth, made this demand in such a dreadful tone of anger, that Giles and Brittles, who were considerably muddled by ale and excitement, stared at each other in a state of stupefaction."
"“警官，请您注意他们的回答，可以吗？”大夫说着，极其严肃地晃了晃他的食指，又点了一下自己的鼻梁骨，请求这位值得尊敬的人物用最大限度的敏锐观察这件事。他又补充道：““这事不久就要略见端倪了。”","“Pay attention to the reply, constable, will you?” said the doctor, shaking his forefinger with great solemnity of manner, and tapping the bridge of his nose with it, to bespeak the exercise of that worthy’s utmost acuteness.“Something may come of this before long.”"
"警官尽量显出了一副英明睿智的样子，还把之前一直撂在壁炉旁边的警棍拿了起来。","The constable looked as wise as he could, and took up his staff of office: which had been reclining indolently in the chimney-corner."
"“您会看到，这是一个很简单的鉴定问题。”大夫说。","“It’s a simple question of identity, you will observe,” said the doctor."
"“就是这么回事，先生。”警官刚一回答，便拼命咳嗽起来；他之前喝得太匆忙，结果一部分啤酒走了岔路，进了气管。","“That’s what it is, sir,” replied the constable, coughing with great violence; for he had finished his ale in a hurry, and some of it had gone the wrong way."
"“有人闯进了这个房子。”大夫说，“这两个人在一个瞬间瞥见了一个孩子。当时硝烟弥漫、漆黑一片、警铃大作，所有人都乱成一团。第二天，有一个男孩恰好来到了这个房子，他的胳膊又碰巧吊了起来，于是这几个男人就对他下了重手——就因为这样，他们使得他现在生命垂危——他们甚至还发誓说他就是小偷。现在问题是，根据事实，这些男人的行为是否正当。如果不正当，那么他们又把自己置于了怎样一种境地呢？”","“Here’s the house broken into,” said the doctor, “and a couple of men catch one moment’s glimpse of a boy, in the midst of gunpowder smoke, and in all the distraction of alarm and darkness.Here’s a boy comes to that very same house, next morning, and because he happens to have his arm tied up, these men lay violent hands upon him—by doing which, they place his life in great danger—and swear he is the thief.Now, the question is, whether these men are justified by the fact; if not, in what situation do they place themselves?”"
"警官意味深长地点点头。他说，要是这一番话没有法律依据的话，他倒是想看看，什么才算是有法律依据的。","The constable nodded profoundly.He said, if that wasn’t law, he would be glad to know what was."
"“我再问你们一次，”大夫大声吼道，声如响雷，“你们两个郑重起誓，到底是否能够指正那个孩子？”","“I ask you again,” thundered the doctor, “are you, on your solemn oaths, able to identify that boy?”"
"布里特尔斯先生迷惑地看着贾尔斯先生，贾尔斯先生也迷惑地看着布里特尔斯先生。警察将一只手拢在耳朵后面，以便随时捕捉他们的答案；两个女人和补锅匠为了听清回答，也都向前倾着身子；大夫则敏锐地环视着四周。就在这个时候，门口传来一阵铃声，同时还响起的还有车轮滚动的声音。","Brittles looked doubtfully at Mr. Giles; Mr. Giles looked doubtfully at Brittles; the constable put his hand behind his ear, to catch the reply; the two women and the tinker leaned forward to listen; the doctor glanced keenly round; when a ring was heard at the gate, and at the same moment, the sound of wheels. "
"“是巡捕来了！”布里特尔斯说道，很明显他大大松了一口气。","“It’s the runners!” cried Brittles, to all appearance much relieved."
"“什么来了？”大夫大叫起来，这下轮到他吓呆了。","“The what?” exclaimed the doctor, aghast in his turn."
"“是波雾街来的警官，先生。”布里特尔斯举起一支蜡烛，回答说，“今天早上我跟贾尔斯先生派人去请的他们。”","“The Bow Street officers, sir,” replied Brittles, taking up a candle; “me and Mr. Giles sent for ’em this morning.”"
"“什么？”大夫叫了一声。","“What?” cried the doctor."
"“是的，”布里特尔斯回答，“我让车夫带了个口信过去。刚才我还一直奇怪，他们怎么还没到呢，先生。”","“Yes,” replied Brittles; “I sent a message up by the coachman, and I only wonder they weren’t here before, sir.”"
"“你们干的，你们干的？你们这些该死的——该死的慢吞吞的马车，把事都弄砸了。行了，就这样吧。”大夫说完，径自走开了。","“You did, did you?Then confound your—slow coaches down here; that’s all,” said the doctor, walking away."
"第三十一章 危急的处境","CHAPTER XXXI Involves a critical position"
"“谁？”布里特尔斯问道，链子还挂在门上，他把门拉开一个小缝，并用手挡住蜡烛的亮光，向外张望着。","“Who’s that?” inquired Brittles, opening the door a little way, with the chain up, and peeping out, shading the candle with his hand."
"“开门，”门外的人回答道，“我们是从波雾街来的巡视官，你们今天派人去请的。”","“Open the door,” replied a man outside; “it’s the officers from Bow Street, as was sent to today.”"
"听了这话，布里特尔斯大感宽慰。他把门完全打开，面前是一个胖胖的穿着大衣的男人。那人什么话也没说就走了进来，好像在自己家一样从容地把鞋往蹭脚垫上擦了擦。","Much comforted by this assurance, Brittles opened the door to its full width, and confronted a portly man in a great-coat; who walked in, without saying anything more, and wiped his shoes on the mat, as coolly as if he lived there."
"“派个人换下我的同事，行吗，年轻人？”巡视官说，“他正在车上照看马匹。你们这儿有停放马车的地方吗？可以把马车拉进去呆个五分钟或十分钟的。”","“Just send somebody out to relieve my mate, will you, young man?” said the officer; “he’s in the gig, a-minding the prad.Have you got a coach ’us here, that you could put it up in, for five or ten minutes?”"
"布里特尔斯回答说有，并指了指停放马车的地方。壮汉就回到花园门口，帮他的同伴把马车赶进去，而布里特尔斯怀着巨大的钦佩之情，在旁边为他们照路。完事之后，他们就回到屋子里。两位巡视官被带进客厅，他们脱下外衣，摘掉帽子，露出了原有的相貌。","Brittles replying in the affirmative, and pointing out the building, the portly man stepped back to the garden-gate, and helped his companion to put up the gig: while Brittles lighted them, in a state of great admiration.This done, they returned to the house, and, being shown into a parlour, took off their great-coats and hats, and showed like what they were."
"敲门的那个人大约五十来岁，中等个头，身体结实，头发剪得很短，乌黑发亮，蓄着半截连鬓胡子，脸圆圆的，目光敏锐。另一个人红头发，骨瘦如柴的，脚上蹬着长筒靴，其貌不扬，还长了一个朝天鼻，样子看上去很凶恶。","The man who had knocked at the door, was a stout personage of middle height, aged about fifty: with shiny black hair, cropped pretty close; half-whiskers, a round face, and sharp eyes.The other was a red-headed, bony man, in top-boots; with a rather ill-favoured countenance, and a turned-up sinister-looking nose."
"“告诉你家主人，布拉瑟斯和达夫来了，好吗？”身材较胖的那位说道。他捋了捋头发，将一副手铐放在桌上。“噢!晚上好，先生。如果你不介意的话，我能私下和你聊聊吗？”","“Tell your governor that Blathers and Duff is here, will you?” said the stouter man, smoothing down his hair, and laying a pair of handcuffs on the table.“Oh!Good-evening, master.Can I have a word or two with you in private, if you please?”"
"这话是对刚刚出现的罗斯伯力先生说的。罗斯伯力先生做了个手势让布里特尔斯出去，自己则带两位女士进来，关上了门。","This was addressed to Mr. Losberne, who now made his appearance; that gentleman, motioning Brittles to retire, brought in the two ladies, and shut the door."
"“这位是女主人。”罗斯伯力指着梅莱太太说。","“This is the lady of the house,” said Mr. Losberne, motioning towards Mrs. Maylie."
"布拉瑟斯向她鞠了一躬。主人请他坐下，他把帽子放到地板上，坐到一张椅子上，并示意达夫也坐下来。达夫先生看起来不太习惯上流社会的礼节，或者说他对这样的交际，感觉很不舒坦——反正不是前者，就是后者——他四肢痉挛了一阵后，有点难堪地将手杖顶部塞进自己的嘴里，才坐下来。","Mr. Blathers made a bow.Being desired to sit down, he put his hat on the floor, and taking a chair, motioned to Duff to do the same.The latter gentleman, who did not appear quite so much accustomed to good society, or quite so much at his ease in it—one of the two—seated himself, after undergoing several muscular affections of the limbs, and the head of his stick into his mouth, with some embarrassment."
"“现在，关于这起盗窃案，先生，”布拉瑟斯说，“情况究竟如何？”","“Now, with regard to this here robbery, master,” said Blathers.“What are the circumstances?”"
"罗斯伯力先生看来急需争取时间，便非常详细地、啰啰唆唆地叙述了盗窃案的情况。与此同时，布拉瑟斯先生和达夫先生显出了解内情的样子，不时地相互点点头。","Mr. Losberne, who appeared desirous of gaining time, recounted them at great length, and with much circumlocution.Messrs. Blathers and Duff looked very knowing meanwhile, and occasionally exchanged a nod."
"“当然，要等到我查清楚后才能有结论，”布拉瑟斯说，“不过，我初步的看法是——我不介意现在就说出来——这不是乡巴佬干的，对吧，达夫？”","“I can’t say, for certain, till I see the work, of course,” said Blathers; “but my opinion at once is,—I don’t mind committing myself to that extent,—that this wasn’t done by a yokel; eh, Duff?”"
"“肯定不是。”达夫回答道。","“Certainly not,” replied Duff."
"“而且，为了让女士们明白，我翻译一下‘乡巴佬’这个词，我领会你的意思是，这事不是乡下人干的，是吗？”罗斯伯力先生笑着说道。","“And, translating the word yokel for the benefit of the ladies, I apprehend your meaning to be, that this attempt was not made by a countryman?” said Mr. Losberne, with a smile."
"“没错，先生。”布拉瑟斯回答道。“这就是这个盗窃案的全部情况，是不是？”","“That’s it, master,” replied Blathers.“This is all about the robbery, is it?”"
"“全部情况。”医生回答道。","“All,” replied the doctor."
"“那么，仆人们都在谈论的这里的一个男孩是怎么回事？”布拉瑟斯问。","“Now, what is this, about this here boy that the servants are a-talking on?” said Blathers."
"“没有这样的事。”医生回答，“有一个受惊的仆人竟然以为他与这次入室盗窃未遂有些关系。但这是胡说八道，纯粹是无稽之谈。”","“Nothing at all,” replied the doctor.“One of the frightened servants chose to take it into his head, that he had something to do with this attempt to break into the house; but it’s nonsense: sheer absurdity.”"
"“如果是这样，那很容易解决。”达夫说道。","“Wery easy disposed of, if it is,” remarked Duff."
"“他说的话非常正确。”布拉瑟斯说，并肯定地点了点头，还漫不经心地玩着手铐，仿佛它们是一副响板似的。“这孩子是什么人？他自己是怎么说的？他从哪里来？他不会是从天上掉下来的吧，先生？”","“What he says is quite correct,” observed Blathers, nodding his head in a confirmatory way, and playing carelessly with the handcuffs, as if they were a pair of castanets.“Who is the boy?What account does he give of himself?Where did he come from?He didn’t drop out of the clouds, did he, master?”"
"“当然不是。”医生回答道，忐忑不安地望了两位女士一眼。“我知道他的全部经历，但是我们眼下不该谈论这些。我想，你们一定想先去看一看窃贼企图入室盗窃的地点吧？”","“Of course not, replied the doctor, with a nervous glance at the two ladies.“I know his whole history: but we can talk about that presently.You would like, first, to see the place where the thieves made their attempt, I suppose?”"
"“当然。”布拉瑟斯先生说，“我们最好先检查犯罪现场，然后再询问仆人。这是办事的老规矩。”","“Certainly,” rejoined Mr. Blathers.“We had better inspect the premises first, and examine the servants afterwards.That’s the usual way of doing business.”"
"于是有人把蜡烛拿过来了。布拉瑟斯先生和达夫先生就在一名地方警官、布里特尔斯、贾尔斯，简单地说，在其他所有在场的人的陪同下，走进过道尽头的那个小房间，从窗口往外看，后来又绕过草坪，透过窗户往里看。然后又举着一支蜡烛出去，检查了百叶窗，之后又提着一盏马灯追踪脚印，再拿过一把干草叉在灌木丛里乱捅了一会儿。这些做完之后，所有的旁观者屏住呼吸，在旁观者的注视下，他们又走进屋里来，让贾尔斯和布里特尔斯重现他们前一天夜里在那次惊险经历中自己参与的部分。两人来回重演了至少六遍，他们在重大情节上彼此意见不一。演第一遍时只有一处明显的矛盾，到最后一遍时，便不下十二处了。最后总算完成了这个任务。布拉瑟斯和达夫让屋子里的人都出去，他们留下来一块儿商量了很长时间。与他们讨论案件时的保密程度和严肃程度相比，那些名医针对最棘手的医术问题进行的会诊也只不过是儿戏而已。","Lights were then procured; and Messrs. Blathers and Duff, attended by the native constable, Brittles, Giles, and everybody else in short, went into the little room at the end of the passage and looked out at the window; and afterwards went round by way of the lawn, and looked in at the window; and after that, had a candle handed out to inspect the shutter with; and after that, a lantern to trace the footsteps with; and after that, a pitchfork to poke the bushes with.This done, amidst the breathless interest of all beholders, they came in again; and Mr. Giles and Brittles were put through a melodramatic representation of their share in the previous night’s adventures: which they performed some six times over: contradicting each other, in not more than one important respect, the first time, and in not more than a dozen the last. This consummation being arrived at, Blathers and Duff cleared the room, and held a long council together, compared with which, for secrecy and solemnity, a consultation of great doctors on the knottiest point in medicine, would be mere child’s play."
"与此同时，医生在隔壁房间里坐立不安，不停地来回踱步，而梅莱太太和罗丝小姐则带着焦虑的神色在一旁望着他。","Meanwhile, the doctor walked up and down the next room in a very uneasy state; and Mrs. Maylie and Rose looked on, with anxious faces."
"“说实在的，”他在房间里转了很多圈之后停了下来，说道，“我简直不知道该怎么办。”","“Upon my word,” he said, making a halt, after a great number of very rapid turns, “I hardly know what to do.”"
"“无疑，”罗丝说，“如果我们如实地向两位警官复述这个可怜孩子的经历，足以使他免罪。”","“Surely,” said Rose, “the poor child’s story, faithfully repeated to these men, will be sufficient to exonerate him.”"
"“我对此表示怀疑，亲爱的小姐，”医生摇摇头说道，“我认为，无论是他们，还是更高级的法官，都不能让他免罪。毕竟，他们会问，他是干什么的呢？一个逃跑的人。仅从世俗的因素和倾向判断，他的经历是非常可疑的。”","“I doubt it, my dear young lady,” said the doctor, shaking his head.“I don’t think it would exonerate him, either with them, or with legal functionaries of a higher grade.What is he, after all, they would say?A runaway.Judged by mere worldly considerations and probabilities, his story is a very doubtful one.”"
"“你相信他的经历，是吧？”罗丝打断他，说道。","“You believe it, surely?” interrupted Rose."
"“——我——相信，尽管听起来很不可思议。也许我这样是老糊涂了，”医生回答道，“不过，我想，对一个经验丰富的警官讲这样的故事，可能不足为信。”","“—I—believe it, strange as it is; and perhaps I may be an old fool for doing so,” rejoined the doctor; “but I don’t think it is exactly the tale for a practical police-officer, nevertheless.”"
"“为什么不呢？”罗丝追问道。","“Why not?” demanded Rose."
"“因为，我漂亮的盘问人，”医生回答道，“因为在他们看来，他的经历中有不少丑陋之处，而他只能证明那些显得对他不利的部分，而对他有利的部分却无法证明。这些讨厌的家伙，他们一定会问明原因和理由，绝不会把任何问题看作是理所当然的。你瞧，据他所说，他在过去的某段时间里一直与小偷们为友。他曾被送去过警察局，因为被指控扒窃一位先生的钱包。他从那位先生家里被强行带到一个他无从描述也无法指认的地方。他对那个地方的情况一无所知。他被人带到了彻特西，那些人似乎对他抱着莫大的希望，不管他愿不愿意。后来他被人从一个窗口塞进去，想要抢劫一户人家。然后，正当他想叫醒这家人，从而做出使自己走上正道、洗刷罪名的举动时，半路突然窜出一个没教养的男管家，像笨狗一样，还向他开枪！那个管家好像有意阻止他做出任何能对自己有益的事似的！难道你不明白这一切吗？”","“Because, my pretty cross-examiner,” replied the doctor: “because, viewed with their eyes, there are many ugly points about it; he can only prove the parts that look ill, and none of those that look well.Confound the fellows, they—will—have the why and the wherefore, and will take nothing for granted.On his own showing, you see, he has been the companion of thieves for some time past; he has been carried to a police-officer, on a charge of picking a gentleman’s pocket; he has been taken away, forcibly, from that gentleman’s house, to a place which he cannot describe or point out, and of the situation of which he has not the remotest idea.He is brought down to Chertsey, by men who seem to have taken a violent fancy to him, whether he will or no; and is put through a window to rob a house; and then, just at the very moment when he is going to alarm the inmates, and so do the very thing that would set him all to rights, there rushes into the way, a blundering dog of a half-bred butler, and shoots him!As if on purpose to prevent his doing any good for himself!Don’t you see all this?”"
"“我当然明白，”罗丝微笑地看着医生急躁的样子，回答道，“但是有一点我怎么也不明白，那就是这里面有什么能给这个可怜的孩子定罪呢。”","“I see it, of course,” replied Rose, smiling at the doctor’s impetuosity; “but still I do not see anything in it, to criminate the poor child.”"
"“没有吧，”医生回答道，“当然没有！愿上帝保佑你们女人明亮的眼睛！好也罢，坏也罢，对任何问题，他们永远只看到一面，还总是他们最先接触到的那个方面。”","“No,” replied the doctor; “of course not!Bless the bright eyes of your sex!They never see, whether for good or bad, more than one side of any question; and that is, always, the one which first presents itself to them.”"
"大夫慷慨陈词，发表了这番经验之谈后，便把双手插进裤兜里，开始在屋子里踱来踱去，步调比刚才还快。","Having given vent to this result of experience, the doctor put his hands into his pockets, and walked up and down the room with even greater rapidity than before."
"“我越想越觉得，”医生说，“如果让这些人知道了这孩子的真实情况，必定会引起没完没了的困难和麻烦。我断定他们不会相信的。而且即使他们到最后不能拿他怎么样，但长时间的拖延，以及把可能存在的疑点公开讨论的话，必然会大大妨碍你们想把他从苦难中拯救出来的慈善计划。”","“The more I think of it,” said the doctor, “the more I see that it will occasion endless trouble and difficulty if we put these men in possession of the boy’s real story.I am certain it will not be believed; and even if they can do nothing to him in the end, still the dragging it forward, and giving publicity to all the doubts that will be cast upon it, must interfere, materially, with your benevolent plan of rescuing him from misery.”"
"“噢！那怎么办呢？”罗丝叫起来，“天哪，天哪！他们为什么要去把这些人找来？”","“Oh! what is to be done?” cried Rose.“Dear, dear! why did they send for these people?”"
"“哎，真是的！”梅莱太太叫着说，“说什么我也不愿让他们来这里。”","“Why, indeed!” exclaimed Mrs. Maylie.“I would not have had them here, for the world.”"
"“我所知道的只是，”罗斯伯力先生终于冷静地坐下来，带着一副孤注一掷的神情，说道，“我们必须硬着头皮尽力将这件事情对付过去。我们的目的是正当的，因此情有可原。这孩子有严重的热病症状，他的健康状况再也不允许任何人跟他交谈。这是让我们感到欣慰的地方。我们必须充分利用这一点。如果这样还帮不上忙，那么也不是我们的过错了。进来！”","“All I know is,” said Mr. Losberne, at last: sitting down with a kind of desperate calmness, “that we must try and carry it off with a bold face.The object is a good one, and that must be our excuse.The boy has strong symptoms of fever upon him, and is in no condition to be talked to any more; that’s one comfort.We must make the best of it; and if bad be the best, it is no fault of ours.Come in!”"
"“好了，先生。”布拉瑟斯走进房间说道，后面跟着他的同事，他先把房门关紧了，然后才继续说道，“这不是一件有预谋的案子。”","“Well, master,” said Blathers, entering the room followed by his colleague, and making the door fast, before he said any more.“This warn’t a put-up thing.”"
"“那到底什么算是有预谋呢？”医生不耐烦地问道。","“And what the devil’s a put-up thing?” demanded the doctor, impatiently."
"“当有仆人介入其中时，我们就把这样的案件定义为有预谋的盗窃案，女士们。”布拉瑟斯转过身来对两位女士说道，仿佛对她们的无知深感同情，对医生的一无所知却十分蔑视似的。","“We call it a put-up robbery, ladies,” said Blathers, turning to them, as if he pitied their ignorance, but had a contempt for the doctor’s, “when the servants is in it.”"
"“在本案中，没有人怀疑过他们。”梅莱太太说道。","“Nobody suspected them, in this case,” said Mrs. Maylie."
"“很可能没有人值得怀疑，太太。”布拉瑟斯回答道，“不过，尽管如此，他们本来是可以介入其中的。”","“Wery likely not, ma’am,” replied Blathers; “but they might have been in it, for all that.”"
"“正因为无人怀疑的缘故，他们更可能介入。”达夫说道。","“More likely on that wery account,” said Duff."
"“我们发现，这是伦敦人干的，”布拉瑟斯继续报告说，“因为作案的手法是一流的。”","“We find it was a town hand,” said Blathers, continuing his report; “for the style of work is first-rate.”"
"“确实很巧妙。”达夫低声附和道。","“Wery pretty indeed it is,” remarked Duff, in an undertone."
"“有两个人作案，”布拉瑟斯继续说道，“他们还带来了一个男孩，一看那扇窗户的大小就明白了。眼下能说的就这么多。如果方便的话，我们马上要去看看楼上的那个孩子。”","“There was two of ’em in it,” continued Blathers; “and they had a boy with ’em; that’s plain from the size of the window.That’s all to be said at present.We’ll see this lad that you’ve  got upstairs at once, if you please.”"
"“也许他们想先喝点儿什么，梅莱太太？”医生说道，面露喜色，仿佛想出了什么新主意。“噢！当然可以！”罗丝急切地大声说道，“如果你们愿意的话，马上可以办到。”","“Perhaps they will take something to drink first, Mrs. Maylie?” said the doctor: his face brightening, as if some new thoughts has occured to him.“Oh! to be sure!” exclaimed Rose, eagerly.“You shall have it immediately, if you will.”"
"“哦，谢谢，小姐！”布拉瑟斯说，并拉起衣袖在嘴上抹了一把，“这种差事容易让人口渴。什么方便就喝什么，小姐，别特意为我们劳神了。”","“Why, thank you, miss!” said Blathers, drawing his coat-sleeve across his mouth; “it’s s dry work, this sort of duty.Anythink that’s handy, miss; don’t put yourself out of the way, on our accounts.”"
"“喝什么呢？”医生问道，跟着小姐来到餐具柜前。","“What shall it be?” asked the doctor, following the young lady to the sideboard."
"“来点儿烈酒，先生，如果你们不介意的话。”布拉瑟斯回答道，“从伦敦一路乘马车过来很冷，太太。而且我发现烈酒总是更容易御寒，令人有种热乎乎的感觉。”","“A little drop of spirits, master, if it’s all the same,” replied Blathers.“It’s s a cold ride from London, ma’am; and I always find that spirits comes home warmer to the feelings.”"
"这一有趣的看法是讲给梅莱太太听的，而梅莱太太也非常亲切地倾听着。就在布拉瑟斯正向她发表这一见解的时候，医生悄悄溜出了房间。","This interesting communication was addressed to Mrs. Maylie, who received it very graciously.While it was being conveyed to her, the doctor slipped out of the room."
"“噢！”布拉瑟斯说，他不是握着高脚酒杯的杯颈，而是用左手的拇指和食指抓住杯底，把它举到自己胸前，“在我的一生中，像这类案子见得多啦，女士们。”","“Ah!” said Mr. Blathers: not holding his wine-glass by the stem, but grasping the bottom between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand: and placing it in front of his chest; “I have seen a good many pieces of business like this, in my time, ladies.”"
"“那次在埃德蒙顿后巷发生的案子就是，布拉瑟斯。”达夫先生为了帮助他的同事回忆，插嘴说。","“That crack down in the back lane at Edmonton, Blathers,” said Mr. Duff, assisting his colleague’s memory."
"“那个案子和这次的差不多，是不是？”布拉瑟斯接着说，“作案人是康基·齐克韦徳，就是他。”","“That was something in this way, warn’t it?” rejonied Mr.Blathers; “that was done by Conkey Chinkweed, that was.”"
"“你总把那个案子算在他的名下，”达夫回答说，“这案子是家养的狗干的，我跟你说。康基和我一样，跟那个案子一点关系都没有。”","“You always gave that to him” replied Duff.“It was the Family Pet, I tell you.Conkey hadn’t any more to do with it than I had.”"
"“去你的吧！”布拉瑟斯反驳说，“我比你更清楚。你还记得那次康基的钱被抢走的事吗？事情发生得令人吃惊！比我看过的任何一部小说都精彩！”","“Get out!” retorted Mr. Blathers; “I know better.Do you mind that time when Conkey was robbed of his money, though?What a start that was!Better than any novel-book I ever see!”"
"“那是怎么回事？”罗丝问道，只要能让这两个不受欢迎的客人开心，任何话题她都急切地予以支持。","“What was that?” inquired Rose: anxious to encourage any symptoms of good-humour in the unwelcome visitors."
"“小姐，那是一件很少人能碰上的盗窃案，”布拉瑟斯说，“这里说的这个康基·齐克韦德——”“康基就是大鼻子的意思，小姐。”达夫插嘴说。","“It was a robbery, miss, that hardly anybody would have been down upon,” said Blathers.“This here Conkey Chickweed—” “Conkey means Nosey, ma’am,” interposed Duff."
"“小姐当然知道这个，是吧？”布拉瑟斯先生说道,“你怎么老是打岔，你这个伙计！小姐，就是这个康基·齐克韦德在战桥大道上开了一家酒馆，他有一个酒窖，许多年轻少爷都去那里看斗鸡、耍獾子一类的游戏；摆弄这些游戏可得费不少脑子，因为我也常常去看。他那会儿并不是什么家族的成员。一天晚上，深更半夜时，他装在一个帆布袋里的三百二十七个几尼被一个戴着黑眼罩的高个子男人偷走了。那个男人先躲在床下面，得手后便纵身从窗口逃走了。那窗子只有一层楼高。他的动作非常麻利。但是康基的动作也不慢，因为他被一阵声音吵醒后立即从床上跳下来，从背后朝他开了一枪，把左邻右舍都惊醒了。他们马上一起大叫着追赶，四处张望，然后他们发现康基其实打中了那个贼，因为一路上都是血迹，一直到离得很远的围篱那里，血迹就消失了。但是不管怎样，那个贼已经把那笔钱弄走了。因此，持照酒商齐克韦德先生的名字便和别的破产者的名字一起出现在公报上了。于是对那个可怜的人的各种救济金和捐赠接踵而至，我也不知道到底有多少。可他心情一直很低落，一连三四天在街上跑来跑去，发疯似的揪着自己的头发，许多人都担心他可能要寻短见。有一天他匆匆忙忙来到警察局，单独会见了治安官。经过一阵谈话后，铃铛响了，杰姆•斯派尔斯被叫了进去（杰姆是个很能干的警官）。治安官让他去帮助齐克韦德先生抓住那个抢劫他家的人。‘昨天早上我看到他了，’齐克韦德说，‘他从我家门口走过去。’‘那你为什么不赶过去把他给抓住！’斯派尔斯说。‘我当时已经吓得浑身瘫软，任何人用根牙签就能把我的脑壳给砸碎，’那可怜的人说，‘可我们一定能抓住他的，因为在夜里十到十一点钟之间他又从这里经过。’斯派尔斯一听到这话立即往口袋里放了一些干净的亚麻布，还装上一把梳子，想着得去个一两天，然后就跟着齐克韦徳去了。斯派尔斯呆在酒馆的一个窗子边，藏在那块小小的红窗帘后，头上仍戴着帽子，只要一听到动静就能立即冲出去。深夜，他正在这儿吸烟斗，这时齐克韦德突然大喊：‘他来了！抓贼啦！杀人啦！’杰姆·斯派尔斯冲了出来，他看见齐克韦德沿着那条街拼命地跑，而且边跑边大喊捉贼。斯派尔斯也跑了过去。齐克韦德则一直往前跑。人们转过身来，大家都高喊‘捉贼啦！’而齐克韦徳自己像发疯似的一直不停地叫喊。斯派尔斯沿街角拐弯的时候，却看不见他的踪影。等他再冲过去，就只见一小堆人聚在那里。他钻进去：‘要抓的人呢？’‘真见鬼！’齐克韦德说，‘又让他跑掉了！’这真是一件怪事，可现在哪儿也找不到他了。于是他们也只得回酒馆了。第二天早上，斯派尔斯还在老地方藏着，从窗帘后面往外张望，寻找那个戴着黑眼罩的高个子男人，直到他的双眼又感到酸痛了。最后他不得不闭上眼睛，让自己稍稍舒服一会儿。可是他刚合上眼睛，便听到齐克韦德大声叫喊着：‘他来啦！’他再次猛冲出去，齐克韦德跑在他前头，已跑到沿街的半路上。在跑了比昨天多一倍的路程之后，那个贼又不见了。这样的追捕又重复了一两次，直到有一半的邻居声称齐克韦德是被魔鬼抢劫了，魔鬼之后又来捉弄他。而另一半邻居则认为可怜的齐克韦德先生已因悲痛而疯掉了。”","“Of course the lady knows that, don’t she?”　demanded Mr. Blathers.“Always interrupting, you are, partner!This here Conkey Chickweed, miss, kept a public-house over Battlebridge way, and he had a cellar, where a good many young lords went to see cock-fighting, and badger-drawing, and that; and a wery intellectual manner the sports was conducted in, for I’ve seen ’em off’en.He warn’t one of the family, at that time; and one night he was robbed of three hundred and twenty-seven guineas in a canvas bag, that was stole out of his bedroom in the dead of night, by a tall man with a black patch over his eye, who had concealed himself under the bed, and after committing the robbery, jumped slap out of window: which was only a story high.He was wery quick about it.But Conkey was quick, too; for he fired a blunderbuss arter him, and roused the neighbourhood.They set up a hue-and-cry, directly, and when they came to look about ’em, found that Conkey had hit the robber; for there was traces of blood, all the way to some palings a good distance off; and there they lost ’em.However, he had made off with the blunt; and, consequently, the name of Mr. Chickweed, licensed witler, appeared in the Gazette among the other bankrupts; and all manner of benefits and subscriptions, and I don’t know what all, was got up for the poor man, who was in a wery low state of mind about his loss, and went up and down the streets, for three or four days, a pulling his hair off in such a desperate manner that many people was afraid he might be going to make away with himself.One day he came up to the office, all in a hurry, and had a private interview with the magistrate, who, after a deal of talk, rings the bell, and orders Jem Spyers in (Jem was a active officer), and tells him to go and assist Mr. Chickweed in apprehending the man as robbed his house.‘I see him, Spyers,’ said Chickweed, ‘pass my house yesterday morning.’ ‘Why didn’t you up, and collar him!’ says Spyers.‘I was so struck all of a heap, that you might have fractured my skull with a toothpick,’ says the poor man; ‘but we’re sure to have him; for between ten and eleven o’clock at night he passed again.’Spyers no sooner heard this, than he put some clean linen and a comb, in his pocket, in case he should have to stop a day or two; and away he goes, and sets himself down at one of the public-house windows behind the little red curtain, with his hat on, all ready to bolt out, at a moment’s notice.He was smoking his pipe here, late at night, when all of a sudden Chickweed roars out, ‘Here he is!Stop thief!Murder!’Jem Spyers dashes out; and there he sees Chickweed, a-tearing down the street full cry.Away goes Spyers; on goes Chickweed; round turns the people; everybody roars out, ‘Thieves!’ and Chickweed himself keeps on shouting, all the time, like mad.Spyers loses sight of him a minute as he turns a corner; shoots round; sees a little crowd; dives in; ‘Which is the man?’‘D—me!’ says Chickweed, ‘I’ve lost him again!’It was a remarkable occurrence, but he warn’t to be seen nowhere, so they went back to the public-house.Next morning, Spyers took his old place, and looked out, from behind the curtain, for a tall man with a black patch over his eye, till his own two eyes ached again.At last, he couldn’t help shutting ’em, to ease ’em a minute; and the very moment he did so, he hears Chickweed a-roaring out, ‘Here he is!’Off he starts once more, with Chickweed half-way down the street ahead of him; and after twice as long a run as the yesterday’s one, the man’s lost again!This was done, once or twice more, till one-half the neighbours gave out that Mr. Chickweed had been robbed by the devil, who was playing tricks with him arterwards; and the other half, that poor Mr. Chickweed had gone mad with grief.”"
"“杰姆·斯派尔斯怎么说？”医生问。在这个故事开始不久，他就回到房里来了。","“What did Jem Spyers say?” inquired the doctor; who had returned to the room shortly after the commencement of the story."
"“杰姆·斯派尔斯，”警官继续说道，“有很长时间他什么话也不说，但耳听八方，别人从表面上却看不出来，这说明他精通本行。可是有一天早上，他走进酒吧，掏出鼻烟盒，说道：‘齐克韦德，我已经找到抢劫犯了。’‘是吗？’齐克韦徳说，‘噢，亲爱的斯派尔斯，快让我去找他报了这个仇，那我死也瞑目了！哦，我亲爱的斯派尔斯，那个恶棍在哪儿？’‘得了吧！’斯派尔斯说，倒给他一撮鼻烟，‘收起你那一套鬼把戏吧！这事是你自己干的！’事实上就是他干的。他借此已经捞了一大笔钱，他要是不那么急于为自己撇清，装神弄鬼，谁也别想抓住他！”布拉瑟斯说，他放下酒杯，拿起那副叮当作响的手铐。","“Jem Spyers,” resumed the officer, “for a long time said nothing at all, and listened to everything without seeming to, which showed he understood his business.But, one morning, he walked into the bar, and taking out his snuffbox, says ‘Chickweed, I’ve  found out who done this here robbery.’‘Have you?’ said Chickweed.‘Oh, my dear Spyers, only let me have wengeance, and I shall die contented!Oh, my dear Spyers, where is the villain!’‘Come!’ said Spyers, offering him a pinch of snuff, ‘none of that gammon!You did it yourself.’So he had; and a good bit of money he had made by it, too; and nobody would never have found it out, if he hadn’t been so precious anxious to keep up appearances!” said Mr. Blathers, putting down his wine-glass, and clinking the handcuffs together."
"“听起来的确很新鲜。”医生说，“现在，如果你们愿意，你们可以上楼去了。”","“Very curious, indeed,” observed the doctor.“Now, if you please, you can walk upstairs.”"
"“您——先——请，先生。”布拉瑟斯先生回应说。两位警官于是紧跟在罗斯伯力先生身后，到楼上奥利弗的房间里去。贾尔斯先生举着蜡烛在前面带路。","“If—you—please, sir,” returned Mr. Blathers.Closely following Mr. Losberne, the two officers ascended to Oliver’s bedroom; Mr. Giles preceding the party, with a lighted candle."
"奥利弗一直在打瞌睡，但看上去情况更糟糕了，身上的温度也比刚开始时更高了。在医生的帮助下，他勉强在床上坐了一两分钟。望着这两个陌生人完全不知道是怎么回事——事实上，他看来似乎也记不起自己身在何处，或这里发生了什么事情了。","Oliver had been dozing; but looked worse, and was more feverish than he had appeared yet.Being assisted by the doctor, he managed to sit up in bed for a minute or so; and looked at the strangers without at all understanding what was going forward—in fact, without seeming to recollect where he was, or what had been passing."
"“这个孩子，”罗斯伯力先生饱含感情，轻声说道“这个就是他们说的那个小子，他因为淘气误闯进这后面一位名叫什么来的先生的园子，被人用弹簧枪打伤了。今天一早跑到这里求助，却马上被现在这位手持蜡烛的先生给抓起来了。他可真够聪明的，还虐待这个孩子。作为医生，我可以证明，他已经把这个孩子的生命置于相当危险的境地。”","“This,” said Mr. Losberne, speaking softly, but with great vehemence notwithstanding, “this is the lad, who, being accidently wounded by a spring-gun in some boyish trespass on Mr. What—d’ ye—call—him’s grounds, at the back here, comes to the house for assistance this morning, and is immediately laid hold of and maltreated, by that ingenious gentleman with the candle in his hand: who has placed his life in considerable danger, as I can professionally certify.”"
"听了医生这样介绍贾尔斯先生后，布拉瑟斯先生和达夫先生都不由自主地注视着他。这位手足无措的男管家怀着既恐惧又困惑不解的表情，先茫然地看看他们，又看看奥利弗，然后再看看罗斯伯力先生，显得很可笑。","Messrs. Blathers and Duff looked at Mr. Giles, as he was thus recommended to their notice.The bewildered butler gazed from them towards Oliver, and from Oliver towards Mr. Losberne, with a most ludicrous mixture of fear and perplexity."
"“我想，你该不是想否认吧？”医生一边说，一边轻轻地扶着奥利弗重新躺到床上。","“You don’t mean to deny that, I suppose?” said the doctor, laying Oliver gently down again."
"“我这样做完全——完全出于好意，先生。”贾尔斯回答道，“我当时真的以为他就是那个男孩，否则我就不会那样对他。我不是一个生性残酷的人，先生。”","“It was all done for the—for the best, sir,” answered Giles.“I am sure I thought it was the boy, or I wouldn’t have meddled with him.I am not of an inhuman disposition, sir.”"
"“以为他是哪个男孩？”年长的警官问道。","“Thought it was what boy?” inquired the senior office."
"“盗贼带来的孩子，先生！”贾尔斯回答道，“他们——他们肯定带着一个男孩。”","“The housebreaker’s boy, sir!” replied Giles“They—they certainly had a boy.”"
"“是吗？你现在还这么认为吗？”布拉瑟斯问。","“Well?Do you think so now?” inquired Blathers."
"“现在认为什么？”贾尔斯问道，茫然地望着提问的人。","“Think what, now?” replied Giles, looking vacantly at his questioner."
"“笨蛋，你还认为是同一个男孩吗？”布拉瑟斯不耐烦地说道。","“Think it’s the same boy, Stupid-head?” rejoined Blathers, impatiently."
"“我不知道，我真的不知道。”贾尔斯满脸愁容地回答道，“我当时不能断定是不是他。”","“I don’t know; I really don’t know,” said Giles, with a rueful countenance.“I couldn’t swear to him.”"
"“你现在认为呢？”布拉瑟斯先生问。","“What do you think?” asked Mr. Blathers."
"“我不知道该怎么想。”可怜的贾尔斯回答，“我认为他不是那个孩子，其实，我几乎可以肯定他不是。这不可能，您也知道。”","“I don’t know what to think,” replied poor Giles.“I don’t think it is the boy; indeed, I’m almost certain that it isn’t.You know it can’t be.”"
"“这个人喝醉了吗，先生？”布拉瑟斯回过头来问医生。","“Has this man been a-drinking, sir?” inquired Blathers, turning to the doctor."
"“你真是一个大傻瓜！”达夫极其轻蔑地对贾尔斯先生说道。","“What a precious muddle-headed chap you are!” said Duff, addressing Mr. Giles, with supreme contempt."
"在这段简短的对话过程中，罗斯伯力先生一直在给奥利弗号脉。这会儿，他从床边的椅子上站起来，说如果警官们对这个问题还有任何疑问的话，不如到隔壁房间去，再问问布里特尔斯。","Mr. Losberne had been feeling the patient’s pulse during this short dialogue; but he now rose from the chair by the bedside, and remarked, that if the officers had any doubts upon the subject, they would perhaps like to step into the next room, and have Brittles before them."
"两位警官接受了这一建议，他们一起走去旁边的一间屋子。布里特尔斯也被叫了过来，只是他自己和他可敬的上司一样，陷入了一个神奇的迷宫中，不同的矛盾和不可能发生的事情不断涌出，丝毫无助于说明任何问题，除了让人明白他脑子里是一团浆糊。除此之外，事实上，他只是声称，如果此刻作案的小孩站在他面前，他也辨认不出来。他把奥利弗当作那个作案的孩子，只是因为贾尔斯先生说他是。况且，贾尔斯先生在五分钟前还在厨房承认，他开始感到非常担心，可能自己有点儿草率了。在其他种种别出心裁的猜测中，有人提出这样的问题：盖尔斯是否真的开枪击中过任何人。在检查了与他用过的那只枪配对的另一支手枪之后，人们发现除了装上火药和牛皮纸外，根本没有装上任何比它们更具杀伤力的东西。这一发现给在场的每个人都留下了深刻的印象，不过除了医生以外，因为在大约十分钟前，他已经把子弹取出来了。不过，谁也比不上贾尔斯先生对此印象深刻。几个小时以来，他一直为对一个同伴造成了致命伤害而苦恼。现在，他急切地抓住这一新的看法，极力加以赞成。最终，这两位警官不怎么再操心奥利弗的事了。他们离开了彻特西，自己到镇上找地方过夜，答应明天一早再来。","Acting upon this suggestion, they adjourned to a neighbouring apartment, where Mr. Brittles, being called in, involved himself and his respected superior in such a wonderful maze of fresh contradictions and impossibilities, as tended to throw no particular light on anything, but the fact of his own strong mystification;except, indeed, his declarations that he shouldn’t know the real boy, if he were put before him that instant; that he had only taken Oliver to be he, because Mr. Giles had said he was; and that Mr. Giles had, five minutes previously, admitted in the kitchen, that he began to be very much afraid he had been a little too hasty. Among other ingenious surmises, the question was then raised, whether Mr. Giles had really hit anybody; and upon examination of the fellow pistol to that which he had fired, it turned out to have no more destructive loading than gunpowder and brown paper: a discovery which made a considerable impression on everybody but the doctor, who had drawn the ball about ten minutes before.Upon no one, however, did it make a greater impression than on Mr. Giles himself; who, after labouring, for some hours, under the fear of having mortally wounded a fellow-creature, eagerly caught at this new idea, and favoured it to the utmost. Finally, the officers, without troubling themselves very much about Oliver, left the Chertsey constable in the house, and took up their rest for that night in the town; promising to return the next morning."
"第二天早晨，有传言说，在金斯顿关了两个男人和一个男孩，他们是前一天夜晚因行迹可疑被抓起来的。于是布拉瑟斯先生和达夫先生便去了金斯顿。但那所谓行迹可疑的情况，经过调查已经完全弄清了。事实上，他们只不过被发现在一个草垛下睡觉。这虽然是一大罪行，却只能处以监禁，而且，根据英国法律仁慈的特点及其他对英王所有臣民的普遍关爱，没有其他确凿的证据能够认定那个睡觉的人或那几个睡觉的人犯了夜晚暴力盗窃的罪行，因此他们不可能被判死刑。布拉瑟斯和达夫两位先生又回来了，毫无所获地白跑了一趟。","With the next morning, there came a rumour, that two men and a boy were in the cage at Kingston, who had been apprehended over night under suspicious circumstances; and to Kingston Messrs. Blathers and Duff journeyed accordingly.The suspicious circumstances, however, resolving themselves, on investigation, into the one fact, that they had been discovered sleeping under a haystack; wihch, although a great crime, is only punishable by imprisonment, and is, in the merciful eye of the English law, and its comprehensive love of all the King’s subjects, held to be no satisfactory proof, in the absence of all other evidence, that the sleeper, or sleepers, have committed burglary accompanied with violence, and have therefore rendered themselves liable to the punishment of death; Messrs. Blathers and Duff came back again, as wise as they went."
"总之，经过更进一步的调查和多次交涉之后，附近的一位治安官才同意了奥利弗由梅莱太太和罗斯伯力先生共同保释的要求，但必须保证奥利弗随叫随到。布拉瑟斯和达夫在得到几个几尼的酬劳金之后就回到市里去了。不过二人对此行所办案子的结论却大相径庭：后一位先生在慎重地考虑了各方面的情况之后，倾向于相信这一未遂的抢劫案必是由家养狗发起的。而前一位先生则在同等程度上倾向于相信，这一切都出自康基·齐克韦德之手。","In short, after some more examination, and a great deal more conversation, a neighbouring magistrate was readily induced to take the joint bail of Mrs. Maylie and Mr. Losberne for Oliver’s appearance if he should ever be called upon; and Blathers and Duff, being rewarded with a couple of guineas, returned to town with divided opinions on the subject of their expedition: the latter gentleman on a mature consideration of all the circumstances, inclining to the belief that the burglarious attempt had originated with the Family Pet; and the former being equally disposed to concede the full merit of it to the great Mr. Conkey Chickweed."
"与此同时，奥利弗在梅莱太太、罗丝，还有好心的罗斯伯力先生共同照料下逐渐恢复。倘若那些热情迸发、满怀感激，又发自内心的祷告，在天国能够听到——如果不被听到，那什么算是祷告！——那么，这个孤儿为他们祈求的神恩已渗入他们的灵魂，将为他们带来安宁和幸福。","Meanwhile, Oliver gradually throve and prospered under the united care of Mrs. Maylie, Rose, and the kind-hearted Mr. Losberne.If fervent prayers, gushing from hearts overcharged with gratitude, be heard in heaven—and if they be not, what prayers are!—the blessings which the orphan child called down upon them, sunk into their souls, diffusing peace and happiness."
"第三十二章 奥利弗和善良的朋友们开始幸福的生活","CHAPTER XXXII Of the happy life Oliver began to lead with his kind friends"
"奥利弗身上有各种各样的疼痛，而且疼得都不轻。除了手臂被打断、医治不及时外，由于经常在潮湿、寒冷的户外生活，奥利弗又发烧又患疟疾。他被病魔缠身达数周之久，这让他看起来总是没什么精神。然而，他的健康状况终于渐渐好转。他有时也能含着眼泪说上几句，说他多么深刻地感受到两位可爱女士的善良，多么热切地希望自己的身体重新变得又强壮又健康，能做些什么事表达他的感激之情。仅仅做些什么，让她们可以看到他内心充满着爱和责任；不论是多么微不足道的小事，他都将向她们证明，她们的慷慨和善良没有白费。相反地，她们用仁慈从痛苦和死亡中拯救出的这个可怜的孩子，真心实意地渴望为她们效劳。","Oliver’s ailings were neither slight nor few.In addition to the pain and delay attendant on a broken limb, his exposure to the wet and cold had brought on fever and ague: which hung about him for many weeks, and reduced him sadly.But, at length, he began, by slow degrees, to get better, and to be able to say sometimes, in a few tearful words, how deeply he felt the goodness of the two sweet ladies, and how ardently he hoped that when he grew strong and well again, he could do something to show his gratitude;only something, which would let them see the love and duty with which his breast was full; something, however slight, which would prove to them that their gentle kindness had not been cast away; but that the poor boy whom their charity had rescued from misery, or death, was eager to serve them with his whole heart and soul."
"有一天，感激的言辞直冲到奥利弗苍白的唇边，身体虚弱的他挣扎着把它们说出口，罗丝听了，说道：“可怜的孩子！只要你愿意，会有许多机会为我们效劳的。我们就要到乡下去住一段时间，婶婶打算让你和我们一块儿去。那里环境幽静、空气清新，还有春天里的各种事物令人赏心悦目，不用几天你就可以完全恢复健康了。只要你不嫌麻烦，我们有很多地方都用得着你呢。”","“Poor fellow!” said Rose, when Oliver had been one day feebly endeavouring to utter the words of thankfulness that rose to his pale lips; “you shall have many opportunities of serving us, if you will.We are going into the country, and my aunt intends that you shall accompany us.The quiet place, the pure air, and all the pleasure and beauties of spring, will restore you in a few days.We will employ you in a hundred ways, when you can bear the trouble.”"
"“怎么会麻烦！”奥利弗大叫着，“噢！亲爱的小姐，我只求能为你干些什么事情。要是为你浇浇花、看看鸟，或者整天跑上跑下就能让你高兴的话，我要付出什么才能得到这样的机会呢！”","“The trouble!” cried Oliver.“Oh! dear lady, if I could but work for you; if I could only give you pleasure by watering your flowers, or watching your birds, or running up and down the whole day long, to make you happy; what would I give to do it!”"
"“你什么也不用付出，”梅莱小姐说，“因为正像我前面对你说的，我们用得着你的地方多着呢。要是你能花上一半的精力，你就真的让我感到很高兴了。”","“You shall give nothing at all,” said Miss Maylie, smiling; “for, as I told you before, we shall employ you in a hundred ways; and if you only take half the trouble to please us, that you promise now, you will make me very happy indeed.”"
"“高兴，小姐！”奥利弗叫道，“你这么说，真是太善良了！”","“Happy, ma’am!” cried Oliver; “how kind of you to say so!”"
"“你会让我感到无以言表的幸福。”年轻的小姐回答说，“只要一想到我亲爱的好婶婶曾把一个人从你所描述的那种不幸的苦难中拯救出来，我就感到说不出的快乐。然后又知道了她所怜悯的对象是个真诚的、充满感激而且有情有意的人，这带给我的喜悦，你是难以想象的。你明白我的意思吗？”看着奥利弗若有所思的样子，她问道。","“You will make me happier than I can tell you,” replied the young lady.“To think that my dear good aunt should have been the means of rescuing any one from such sad misery as you have described to us, would be an unspeakable pleasure to me; but to know that the object of her goodness and compassion was sincerely grateful and attached, in consequence, would delight me, more than you can well imagine.Do you understand me?” she inquired, watching Oliver's thoughtful face."
"“噢，明白，小姐，明白！”奥利弗急切地回答道，“可是我刚才在想，我现在是个忘恩负义的人。”","“Oh yes, ma’am, yes!” replied Oliver eagerly; “but I was thinking that I am ungrateful now.”"
"“对谁忘恩负义呢？”年轻的小姐问。","“To whom?” inquired the young lady."
"“对那位善良的先生和那位可亲的老保姆。他们以前很照顾我。”奥利弗回答道，“如果他们知道我现在有多幸福，我肯定他们也会感到高兴的。”","“To the kind gentleman, and the dear old nurse, who took so much care of me before,” rejoined Oliver.“If they knew how happy I am, they would be pleased, I am sure.”"
"“我相信他们会的。”奥利弗的女恩人说道，“罗斯伯力先生真体贴，他已经答应在你能承受旅途劳顿的时候，陪你去看望他们。”","“I am sure they would,” rejoined Oliver’s benefactress; “and Mr. Losberne has already been kind enough to promise that when you are well enough to bear the journey, he will carry you to see them.”"
"“他答应了吗，小姐？”奥利弗笑逐颜开，叫了起来，“等我再见到他们慈祥的面容时，肯定高兴得都不知道该如何是好了！”","“Has he, ma’am?” cried Oliver, his face brightening with pleasure.“I don’t know what I shall do for joy when I see their kind faces once again!”"
"没过多久，奥利弗的身体就基本恢复了，足以经受住出这趟远门的疲劳了。于是，一天早上，奥利弗和罗斯伯力先生便乘坐梅莱太太的一辆小马车上路了。当他们到达彻特西桥的时候，奥利弗的脸色变得非常苍白，大叫了一声。","In a short time Oliver was sufficiently recovered to undergo the fatigue of this expedition.One morning he and Mr. Losberne set out, accordingly, in a little carriage which belonged to Mrs. Maylie.When they came to Chertsey Bridge, Oliver turned very pale, and uttered a loud exclamation."
"“这孩子怎么了？”医生和平时一样忙忙叨叨地叫道,“你是不是看到什么了——听到什么了——还是感觉到什么了——嗯？”","“What's the matter with the boy?” cried the doctor, as usual, all in a bustle.“Do you see anything—hear anything—feel anything—eh?”"
"“那边，先生，”奥利弗指着车窗外叫着说，“那个房子！”","“That, sir,” cried Oliver, pointing out of the carriage window.“That house!”"
"“好的，那个房子怎么了？停下，车夫。在这儿停一停。”医生嚷着说，“那个房子怎么了，小伙子，啊？”","“Yes; well, what of it?Stop coachman.Pull up here,” cried the doctor.“What of the house, my man; eh?”"
"“那些贼——他们带我来过这个房子！”奥利弗小声说。“这是什么鬼地方！”医生叫道，“嗨，就停在这里！让我下车！”可是不等车夫从驾驶座里下来，他不知怎么就已经从车里骨碌着爬出来了。他直奔那所废弃的公寓，像个疯子似的踢门。“嗨？”一个丑陋、矮小又驼背的男人猛地拉开门，问道。而医生由于最后一脚太用力，差点儿摔进过道里。“这是怎么回事？”","“The thieves—the house they took me to!” whispered Oliver.“The devil it is!” cried the doctor.“Hallo, there! let me out!”But, before the coachman could dismount from his box, he had tumbled out of the coach, by some means or other; and, running down to the deserted tenement, began kicking at the door like a madman.“Hallos?” said a little ugly hump-backed man: opening the door so suddenly, that the doctor, from the very impetus of his last kick, nearly fell forward into the passage.“What’s the matter here?”"
"“怎么回事！”另一个大叫道，想也没想就一把揪住了他的领子。“问题多了。就是抢劫的问题。”","“Matter!” exclaimed the other, collaring him, without a moment’s s reflection.“A good deal.Robbery is the matter.”"
"“还可能会有谋杀问题呢，”那驼背的人冷冷地回答说，“你要是不赶快松手的话。你听见我的话没有？”","“There’ll be Murder the matter, too,” replied the hump-backed man, coolly, “if you don’t take your hands off.Do you hear me?”"
"“我听见了。”大夫说着，又使劲摇晃着他抓在手里的这个人。","“I hear you,” said the doctor, giving his captive a hearty shake."
"“他在哪里——那个该死的家伙，他叫什么狗名字来着——赛克斯，就是这个名字。赛克斯在哪儿，你这个贼？”","“Where’s—confound the fellow, what’s his rascally name—Sikes; that’s it.Where’s Sikes, you thief?”"
"那驼背人怒不可遏地瞪大眼睛望着他，似乎惊恐万分，然后他灵巧地从医生的手中挣脱，像发连珠炮似的破口大骂，退回到屋子里去。但是他还没来得及关上门，医生已经走进了客厅，一言未发。","The hump-backed man stared, as if in excess of amazement and indignation; then, Twisting himself, dexterously, from the doctor’s grasp, growled forth a volley of horrid oaths, and retired into the house.Before he could shut the door, however, the doctor had passed into the parlour, without a word of parley."
"他焦虑不安地四处张望，发现里面没有任何家具，也没有任何东西留下痕迹，不管是有生命的还是无生命的，甚至连那个橱柜的位置都和奥利弗的描述全不相符！","He looked anxiously round; not an article of furniture; not a vestige of anything, animate or inanimate; not even the position of the cupboards; answered Oliver’s description!"
"“喂！”驼背人一直敏锐地观察着他，说道，“你这样横冲直撞地闯进我家来，是什么意思？你想抢劫我，还是想谋杀我？究竟是哪一样？”","“Now!” said the hump-backed man, who had watched him keenly, “what do you mean by coming into my house, in this violent way?Do you want to rob me, or to murder me?Which is it?”"
"“难道你见过一个坐着双驾马车的人出来抢劫杀人的，你这可笑的老吸血鬼？”烦躁不安的医生说道。","“Did you ever know a man come out to do either, in a chariot and pair, you ridiculous old vampire?” said the irritable doctor."
"“那么，你想干什么？”驼背人问，“你快滚出去，免得我动手。天杀的！”","“What do you want, then?” demanded the hunchback.“Will you take yourself off, before I do you a mischief?Curse you!”"
"“到该走的时候我会走的。”罗斯伯力先生一边说，一边朝另一个客厅看去。那个客厅跟前面这个一样，一点儿也不像奥利弗描述的那样。“总有一天我会揭开你的老底的，我的朋友。”","“As soon as I think proper,” said Mr. Losberne, looking into the other parlour; which, like the first, bore no resemblance whatever to Oliver’s account of it.“I shall find you out, some day, my friend.”"
"“是吗？”长相丑陋的驼背人冷笑道，你什么时候来抓我都行，我就在这儿。我在这里已经住了二十五年了。我既没有疯，也不是孤单一人，还怕你不成？你会为此付出代价的。你会为此付出代价的。”说完后，这个畸形的恶魔便开始大喊大叫，像气得发疯了一样在地上跳来跳去。","“Will you?” sneered the ill-favoured cripple.“If you ever want me, I’m here.I haven’t lived here mad and all alone, for five-and-twenty years, to be scared by you.You shall pay for this; you shall pay for this.”And so saying, the mis-shapen little demon set up a yell, and danced upon the ground, as if wild with rage."
"“这件事干得真够蠢的，”医生自言自语地低声说道，“那孩子一定是弄错了。喂！把这个装进口袋，再把你自己关起来吧。”说着他扔给那驼背人一张钞票，便回到马车上了。","“Stupid enough, this,” muttered the doctor to himself; “the boy must have made a mistake.Here!Put that in your pocket, and shut yourself up again.”With these words he flung the hunchback a piece of money, and returned to the carriage."
"那人一直跟到马车门边，一路上发出一连串最恶毒的辱骂和诅咒。但是，当罗斯伯力先生转身和车夫说话时，他向车里望了望，一眼看到奥利弗，目光是那么锐利、凶狠，又是那么愤怒、恶毒，使奥利弗在后来的几个月里，无论是睡着还是醒着，都难以忘记。直到车夫回到自己的座位上去，那人还一直恶狠狠地骂个不停，甚至马车上路后，还可以远远地看到他站在原地，或真或假，怒不可遏地跺脚，拉扯自己的头发。","The man followed to the chariot door, uttering the wildest imprecations and curses all the way; but as Mr. Losberne turned to speak to the driver, he looked into the carriage, and eyed Oliver for an instant with a glance so sharp and fierce and at the same time so furious and vindictive, that, waking or sleeping, he could not forget it for months afterwards.He continued to utter the most fearful imprecations, until the driver had resumed his seat; and when they were once more on their way, they could see him some distance behind: beating his feet upon the ground, and tearing his hair, in transports of real or pretended rage."
"“我真是个笨蛋！”沉默了很久后，医生说，“你以前知道那个地方吗，奥利弗？”","“I am an ass!” said the doctor, after a long silence.“Did you know that before, Oliver?”"
"“不知道，先生。”","“No, sir.”"
"“那么下一次再见到可别忘了。”","“Then don’t forget it another time.”"
"“大笨蛋。”医生再次沉默，几分钟后又说道，“即使就是这个地方，那些人也都在这儿，我孤身一人，能做什么呢？就算有人帮我，这么做除了暴露我自己，以及不可避免地要说出我是怎样遮掩此事之外，我看不出有什么好处。不过那样我也是活该。我总是凭一时冲动行事，使自己陷入这样或那样的困境。这教训也许对我有帮助。”","“An ass,” said the doctor again, after a further silence of some minutes.“Even if it had been the right place, and the right fellows had been there, what could I have done, single-handed?And if I had had assistance, I see no good that I should have done, except leading to my own exposure, and an unavoidable statement of the manner in which I have hushed up this business.That would have served me right, though.I am always involving myself in some scrape or other, by acting on impulse.It might have done me good.”"
"事实上，这位杰出的医生，一生中所做的任何事情都是凭一时冲动而为之。这里要对总是控制他做事的冲动的本性，说上一句不是恶意的恭维话，那就是，他非但没有因此陷入任何特别的麻烦和不幸，反而赢得了所有认识他的人最真诚的尊重和敬佩。实事求是地说，在最初的一两分钟他是有点儿生气，因为他对没有获得有关奥利弗经历的佐证大失所望，而这正是他第一次有机会获取这样的证据。但他的怒气很快就平息下来了。同时，他发现奥利弗回答他的问题时依然像从前一样坦白，前后一致，依然带着像过去那样显而易见的诚心诚意，于是，他决心从今以后完全相信他说的话。","Now, the fact was that the excellent doctor had never acted upon anything but impulse all through his life, and it was no bad compliment to the nature of the impulses which governed him, that so far from being involved in any peculiar troubles or misfortunes, he had the warmest respect and esteem of all who knew him.If the truth must be told, he was a little out of temper, for a minute or two, at being disappointed in procuring corroborative evidence of Oliver’s story on the very first occasion on which he had a chance of obtaining any.He soon came round again, however; and finding that Oliver’s replies to his questions, were still as straightforward and consistent, and still delivered with as much apparent sincerity and truth, as they had ever been, he made up his mind to attach full credence to them, from that time forth."
"因为奥利弗知道布朗洛先生所住街道的名字，他们可以赶着车直接就找到那里。当马车转进那条街的时候，奥利弗的心剧烈地跳动，以致他几乎喘不过气来。","As Oliver knew the name of the street in which Mr. Brownlow resided, they were enabled to drive straight thither.When the coach turned into it, his heart beat so violently, that he could scarcely draw his breath."
"“现在，我的孩子，是哪个房子？”罗斯伯力先生问道。","“Now, my boy, which house is it?” inquired Mr. Losberne."
"“那个！”奥利弗迫不及待地指着车窗外回答说，“就是那个白房子。噢！快点儿！请快点儿！我觉得我好像马上就要死了，忍不住浑身发抖。”","“That!“That!” replied Oliver, pointing eagerly out of the window.“The white house.Oh! make haste!Pray make haste!I feel as if I should die: it makes me tremble so.”"
"“到了，到了！”好心的医生轻轻地拍着他的肩膀说，“你马上就能看到他们了，他们看到你安然无恙肯定会欣喜若狂的。”","“Come, come!” said the good doctor, patting him on the shoulder.“You will see them directly, and they will be overjoyed to find you safe and well.”"
"“哦！我希望如此！”奥利弗叫道，“他们对我太好了，对我非常非常好。”","“Oh!I hope so!” cried Oliver.“They were so good to me; so very, very good to me.”"
"马车继续前进。它停了下来。不对，不是这家，旁边的那家才对。马车又前走了几步，然后又停了下来。奥利弗朝窗户里望去，他的脸上，因为即将和亲人相见，挂满了喜悦的泪水。","The coach rolled on.It stopped.No; that was the wrong house; the next door.It went on a few paces, and stopped again.Oliver looked up at the windows, with tears of happy expectation coursing down his face."
"哎呀！那个白房子是空的，窗户外贴了一张招贴，上面写着：“招租”。","Alas! the white house was empty, and there was a bill in the window.“To Let.”"
"“去敲敲隔壁家的门。”罗斯伯力先生拉着奥利弗的一只胳膊大声说，“您知不知道，原来一直住在隔壁的布朗洛先生去哪里了？”","“Knock at the next door,” cried Mr. Losberne, taking Oliver’s arm in his.“What has become of Mr. Brownlow, who used to live in the adjoining house, do you know?”"
"仆人说不知道，但可以进去问问。她很快就折回来了，说布朗洛先生在六个星期以前便卖掉了所有家当，搬到西印度群岛去了。奥利弗握紧双手，无力地向后倒去。","The servant did not know; but would go and inquire.She presently returned, and said, that Mr. Brownlow had sold off his goods, and gone to the West Indies, six weeks before.Oliver clasped his hands, and sank feebly backward."
"“他的管家太太也走了吗？”罗斯伯力先生停顿了一下，问道。","“Has his housekeeper gone too?” inquired Mr. Losberne, after a moment’s s pause."
"“是的，先生。”仆人回答说，“那位老先生、他的管家，还有一位先生——他是布朗洛先生的朋友，都一起去了。”","“Yes, sir”; replied the servant.“The old gentleman, the housekeeper, and a gentleman who was a friend of Mr. Brownlow’s, all went together.”"
"“那就回家去吧，”罗斯伯力先生对车夫说，“咱们一口气跑出这该死的伦敦城，路上先不要喂马！”","“Then turn towards home again,” said Mr. Losberne to the driver; “and don’t stop to bait the horses, till you get out of this confounded London!”"
"“还有书摊老板，先生？”奥利弗说道，“我知道去那里的路。去看看他吧，求您了，先生！去看看他吧！”","“The book-stall keeper, sir?” said Oliver.“I know the way there.See him, pray, sir!Do see him!”"
"“我可怜的孩子，这一天已经够让人失望了。”医生说，“对咱们俩来说，已经足够了。如果我们去书摊老板那里，肯定会发现他要么已经死了，要么房子被烧了，或者他逃跑了。于是，在医生的一时冲动下，他们往回走了。","“My poor boy, this is disappointment enough for one day,” said the doctor.“Quite enough for both of us.If we go to the book-stall keeper’s, we shall certainly find that he is dead, or has set his house on fire, or run away.No; home again straight!”And in obedience to the doctor’s impulse, home they went."
"这难以忍受的失望给奥利弗带来了极大的痛苦和悲伤，即使是在他感觉无比幸福的时候，因为他在生病期间，曾无数次开心地想象，布朗洛先生和贝德温太太见到他可能会对他说什么话；而他会带着何等喜悦的心情，亲口告诉他们，在那么多个漫长的日日夜夜里，他都在回忆他们对他的无限关怀，感伤被残忍地与他们分开。最终他能对他们说清一切，讲清他完全是被劫持而去的。这样的希望在他最近所经受的苦难中一直支撑着他，使他没有倒下。可是现在，一想到他们已经去了那么远的地方，在心里还始终认为他是一个骗子或者一个强盗——这样的想法可能到他自己死了都无法改变——奥利弗几乎无法忍受。","This bitter disappointment caused Oliver much sorrow and grief, even in the midst of his happiness; for he had pleased himself, many times during his illness, with thinking of all that Mr. Brownlow and Mrs. Bedwin would say to him: and what delight it would be to tell them how many long days and nights he had passed in reflecting on what they had done for him, and in bewailing his cruel separation from them.The hope of eventually clearing himself with them, too, and explaining how he had been forced away, had buoyed him up, and sustained him, under many of his recent trials;and now, the idea that they should have gone so far, and carried with them the belief that he was an impostor and a robber—a belief which might remain uncontradicted to his dying day—was almost more than he could bear."
"不过，这种情况没有让他的恩人们在对他的态度上发生任何变化。又过了两个星期，暖和、晴朗的天气到来了，树木渐渐长出嫩叶，花朵繁盛绽放，他们便为要离开彻特西的这个房子，到乡下去呆几个月做准备。","The circumstance occasioned no alteration, however, in the behaviour of his benefactors.After another fortnight, when the fine warm weather had fairly begun, and every tree and flower was putting forth its young leaves and rich blossoms, they made preparations for quitting the house at Chertsey, for some months."
"他们把曾让费金动了贪念的金属餐具送到银行代为保管，留下贾尔斯和另一个仆人看房子，然后带着奥利弗一起到了远处的一个乡间村舍。","Sending the plate, which had so excited Fagin’s cupidity, to the banker’s; and leaving Giles and another servant in care of the house, they departed to a cottage at some distance in the country, and took Oliver with them."
"谁能描述这个多病的孩子在内陆的乡村里，呼吸着清香的空气，置身于青山密林中，有多么的愉悦，多么的心绪平静，又有多么的柔和与安谧！谁能晓得静寂、宁静的景色是如何渗入到喧闹的城市中，那些因痛苦而憔悴不堪的居民脑海中，又是如何将生机深深地带到他们精疲力竭的心灵里！对那些终生辛勤劳作，在拥挤、封闭的街道上生活，却从未希望改变这些状况的人们来说，习惯已成为其第二天性，而几乎可以说他们也已经爱上了构成他们日常生活中狭隘小天地的一砖一石。即使是这样的人，当死神即将降临，他们最终还是渴望能看一眼大自然的容貌，从而远离记载他们旧日的痛苦和往昔的欢乐的地方，他们似乎立即进入了一种崭新的生存状态。一天又一天，他们缓慢地走向某个绿色的阳光地带，看到天空、山丘、平原，以及闪闪发光的湖水，他们的心中便会唤起无限的回忆。那样提前品尝到天堂的味道就会安抚他们迅速沉沦的痛苦。几个小时前他们还在卧室窗口，孤寂地看到逐渐沉没的太阳，光线变得愈来愈暗淡，他们会像太阳一样安静地进入自己的坟墓！平静的乡村景象所唤起的记忆，不属于这个世界，也不属于这个世界所具有的思想和希望。这些记忆会温和地影响我们，可以教我们如何为所爱的人，编织鲜艳的花环，放在他们的坟墓边；也可以净化我们的思想，抑制往日的仇恨。而在这一切之下，即使在那最不愿思考的头脑中，萦回着一种模糊的尚未形成的意识；仿佛在许久以前，在某个遥远的过去，曾有过这样的感觉，唤起人们庄严地看待遥远的未来，将傲慢和世俗之见打压下去。","Who can describe the pleasure and delight, the peace of mind and soft tranquillity, the sickly boy felt in the balmy air, and among the green hills and rich woods, of an inland village!Who can tell how scenes of peace and quietude sink into the minds of pain-worn dwellers in close and noisy places, and carry their own freshness, deep into their jaded hearts!Men who have lived in crowded, pent-up streets, through lives of toil, and who have never wished for change; men, to whom custom has indeed been second nature, and who have come almost to love each brick and stone that formed the narrow boundaries of their daily walks;even they, with the hand of death upon them, have been known to yearn at last for one short glimpse of Nature’s face; and, carried far from the scenes of their old pains and pleasures, have seemed to pass at once into a new state of being.Crawling forth, from day to day, to some green sunny spot, they have had such memories wakened up within them by the sight of the sky, and hill and plain, and glistening water, that a foretaste of heaven itself has soothed their quick decline, and they have sunk into their tombs, as peacefully as the sun whose setting they watched from their lonely chamber window but a few hours before, faded from their dim and feeble sight!The memories which peaceful country scenes call up, are not of this world, nor of its thoughts and hopes.Their gentle influence may teach us how to weave fresh garlands for the graves of those we loved: may purify our thoughts and bear down before it old enmity and hatred;but beneath all this, there lingers, in the least reflective mind, a vague and half-formed consciousness of having held such feelings long before, in some remote and distant time, which calls up solemn thoughts of distant times to come, and bends down pride and worldliness beneath it."
"他们去的地方很美好。奥利弗以前一直生活在脏乱的人群里，在嘈杂和吵闹中打发日子，现在他似乎完全开始了一种崭新的生活。玫瑰和忍冬附着在村舍的墙壁上，常春藤爬上了树干，花园里各种花香弥漫在空气中。不远处是一块小小的教堂坟场，那里没有堆满高大难看的墓碑，都是些简陋的坟冢，覆盖着新鲜的草皮和青苔，村里作古的老人就长眠于此。奥利弗常在这里闲逛，有时他想起母亲那悲惨的坟墓，就坐下来，偷偷掉眼泪。但当他一抬眼，望向头上深蓝的天空，就不再想着她还睡在坟地里，虽然他会悲伤地为母亲哭泣，但并没有感到痛苦。","It was a lovely spot to which they repaired.Oliver, whose days had been spent among squalid crowds, and in the midst of noise and brawling, seemed to enter on a new existence there.The rose and honeysuckle clung to the cottage walls; the ivy crept round the trunks of the trees; and the garden-flowers perfumed the air with delicious odours.Hard by, was a little churchyard; not crowded with tall unsightly gravestones, but full of humble mounds, covered with fresh turf and moss: beneath which, the old people of the village lay at rest.Oliver often wandered here; and, thinking of the wretched grave in which his mother lay, would sometimes sit him down and sob unseen; but, when he raised his eyes to the deep sky overhead, he would cease to think of her as lying in the ground, and would weep for her, sadly, but without pain."
"这是一段幸福的时光。他白天过得那么平静、安详，夜晚也不会感到恐惧和忧虑；没有置身于肮脏监牢中的苦痛，也不用和流氓、暴徒打交道。脑子里只有快乐和幸福的想法。每天早上，他都到离小教堂不远的一位白发老者的家里。老者教他更好地发音，教他写字。他讲话那么和蔼又那么耐心，奥利弗觉得不管怎样努力讨好他都不为过。然后，他就会陪梅莱太太和罗丝小姐一块儿散步，听她们谈论书籍；或者在某个阴凉处，就坐在她们旁边，听罗丝小姐读书。他会一直这样听下去，直到天黑得看不见字了。接着，他要准备第二天的功课。这个时候，他常常在一间面朝花园的小房间里埋头用功。直到夜幕徐徐降临，又到了女士们出去散步的时候，他就陪着她们，乐呵呵地听她们谈论一切。倘若她们要他攀折一枝花，或者跑回去取一件忘带的东西，他总是乐此不疲，跑得再快也不觉得快。当天色已晚，他们回到家里后，年轻的小姐就坐下来弹钢琴，弹奏一支悦耳的歌曲，或者以低柔的嗓音吟唱一些她的婶婶喜欢的老歌。这样的时刻从不需点蜡烛，奥利弗就坐在一扇窗户边，喜不自胜地聆听美妙的音乐。","It was a happy time.The days were peaceful and serene; the nights brought with them neither fear nor care; no languishing in a wretched prison, or associating with wretched men; nothing but pleasant and happy thoughts.Every morning he went to a white-headed old gentleman, who lived near the little church: who taught him to read better, and to write: and who spoke so kindly, and took such pains, that Oliver could never try enough to please him.Then, he would walk with Mrs. Maylie and Rose, and hear them talk of books; or perhaps sit near them, in some shady place, and listen whilst the young lady read: which he could have done, until it grew too dark to see the letters.Then, he had his own lesson for the next day to prepare; and at this, he would work hard, in a little room which looked into the garden, till evening came slowly on, when the ladies would walk out again, and he with them: listening with such pleasure to all they said:and so happy if they wanted a flower that he could climb to reach, or had forgotten anything he could run to fetch: that he could never be quick enough about it.When it became quite dark, and they returned home, the young lady would sit down to the piano, and play some pleasant air, or sing, in a low and gentle voice, some old song which it pleased her aunt to hear.There would be no candles lighted at such times as these; and Oliver would sit by one of the windows, listening to the sweet music, in a perfect rapture."
"礼拜日来了，那一天他过得与以往度过的任何一天都是那么的不同！但还是那么的开心！和在最快乐的时候里度过的其他日子一样！清晨的小教堂，绿叶在窗口摇曳，教堂外边有小鸟啾啾地鸣叫，芳香的空气悄悄飘进低矮的门廊，令朴实的建筑物弥漫着馥郁的芬芳。穷人们也穿得那么整齐干净，虔诚地跪下祈祷。他们聚集在教堂里似乎不是因为要履行冗长乏味的义务，而是出于一种乐趣；虽然唱诗的歌声也许是拙劣的，但它是真实的，听起来（至少在奥利弗听来）比他以前在教堂里听过的任何歌都更加悦耳动听。接着就是像平时一样散步，以及走访许多工作的人，去他们干净的住所看看。晚上，奥利弗读一两章《圣经》，他整个星期都在研究《圣经》。在完成这项任务的过程中，他觉得自己比当上牧师还要自豪和高兴。","And when Sunday came, how differently the day was spent, from any way in which he had ever spent it yet! and how happily too; like the other days in that most happy time!There was the little church, in the morning, with the green leaves fluttering at the windows: the birds singing without: and the sweet-smelling air stealing in at the low porch, and filling the homely building with its fragrance.The poor people were so neat and clean, and knelt so reverently in prayer, that it seemed a pleasure, not a tedious duty, their assembling there together; and though the singing might be rude, it was real, and sounded more musical (to Oliver’s ears at least) than any he had ever heard in church before.Then, there were the walks as usual, and many calls at the clean houses of the labouring men; and at night, Oliver read a chapter or two from the Bible, which he had been studying all the week, and in the performance of which duty he felt more proud and pleased, than if he had been the clergyman himself."
"清晨，奥利弗六点就开始在田野上闲逛，并从周围的树篱上采摘一束束野花，满载而归；他在这些野花中精心挑选，将早餐桌装饰得非常好看。他用新鲜的千里光草来喂养梅莱太太的鸟。奥利弗在村里一位能干的文书指导下，一直在钻研这门手艺。他还用千里光来装饰鸟笼，大受表扬。把这些鸟打扮得整整齐齐、漂漂亮亮之后，奥利弗通常到村子里做一些小小的善事。或者如果没有任务的话，他偶尔打打板球，有时就在草地上进行。再不然的话，花园里总有活要干，就是侍弄花草树木的活。奥利弗（他一直向同一位老师学习这门技术，这位老师可是专门搞园艺的）投入地精心照料这些植物，直到罗丝小姐露面。罗丝小姐对他所做的一切总会赞不绝口。","In the morning, Oliver would be a-foot by six o’clock, roaming the fields, and plundering the hedges, far and wide, for nosegays of wild flowers, with which he would return laden, home; and which it took great care and consideration to arrange, to the best advantage, for the embellishment of the breakfast-table.There was fresh groundsel, too, for Miss Maylie’s birds, with which Oliver, who had been studying the subject under the able tuition of the village clerk, would decorate the cages, in the most approved taste.When the birds were made all spruce and smart for the day, there was usually some little commission of charity to execute in the village; or, failing that, there was rare cricket-playing, sometimes, on the green;or, failing that, there was always something to do in the garden, or about the plants, to which Oliver (who had studied this science also, under the same master, who was a gardener by trade,) applied himself with hearty good-will, until Miss Rose made her appearance: when there were a thousand commendations to be bestowed on all he had done."
"于是，三个月一晃就过去了。这三个月，在那些最幸运也最受宠爱的人们的一生中，也许就是纯粹的欢乐，可是对奥利弗而言，这三个月则是他真正的幸福。一边是最纯洁、最亲切的慷慨行为，另一边是最真诚、最热烈、最刻骨铭心的感激之忱。难怪三个月之后，奥利弗•特威斯特和那位老太太及她的侄女已经完全成为一家人了，强烈的依恋在他那颗年轻而敏感的心里油然而生，而她们以爱回报，并为他感到自豪。","So three months glided away; three months which, in the life of the most blessed and favoured of mortals, might have been unmingled happiness, and which, in Oliver’s were true felicity.With the purest and most amiable generosity on one side; and the truest, warmest, soul-felt gratitude on the other; it is no wonder that, by the end of that short time, Oliver Twist had become completely domesticated with the old lady and her niece, and that the fervent attachment of his young and sensitive heart, was repaid by their pride in, and attachment to, himself."
"第三十三章 奥利弗和朋友们的幸福生活突然被打断了","CHAPTER XXXIII Wherein the happiness of Oliver and his friends, experiences a sudden check "
"春天稍纵即逝，夏天来临了。如果说这个村子最初是漂亮的话，那么，现在则是鲜艳夺目、郁郁葱葱。在几个月前看上去萎缩的、光秃秃的大树，如今迸发出强大的生命力和勃勃的生机。它们伸出绿色的臂膀，遮盖住干渴的地面，把开阔、无遮蔽的地方变成了宜人的、浓密的阴凉角落。从那里，人们可以看到在阳光的笼罩下，辽阔的景色向远处伸展开来。大地穿上了最明亮的绿装，四处散发着馥郁的芳香。这是一年中最好的且最具有活力的时光，万物欣欣向荣，茁壮成长。","Spring flew swiftly by, and summer came.If the village had been beautiful at first it was now in the full glow and luxuriance of its richness.The great trees, which had looked shrunken and bare in the earlier months, had now burst into strong life and health; and stretching forth their green arms over the thirsty ground, converted open and naked spots into choice nooks, where was a deep and pleasant shade from which to look upon the wide prospect, steeped in sunshine, which lay stretched beyond.The earth had donned her mantle of brightest green; and shed her richest perfumes abroad.It was the prime and vigour of the year; all things were glad and flourishing."
"在那个小村舍里，生活依然平静安定，居住在那里的人们，关系也依然安宁和欢愉。奥利弗已经恢复了健康，强壮起来。尽管健康或疾病会使许多人的感情发生变化，但奥利弗却从未改变过对身边的人亲切的感情。他仍然像病痛和苦难消耗他的体力时一样，像极度依赖别人的悉心照料和安慰时一样，温顺、眷恋并充满感情。","Still, the same quiet life went on at the little cottage, and the same cheerful serenity prevailed among its inmates.Oliver had long since grown stout and healthy; but health or sickness made no difference in his warm feelings of a great many people.He was still the same gentle, attached, affectionate creature that he had been when pain and suffering had wasted his strength, and when he was dependent for every slight attention, and comfort on those who tended him."
"一个美丽的夜晚，他们外出散步的时间比平常久了一些，因为那天的天气异常暖和，而且明月当空，和风吹拂，确实令人心旷神怡。罗丝也一直兴致勃勃的，他们谈笑风生，继续往前走，直到远远超出平常的散步范围。梅莱太太太累了，他们便慢慢走回家去，速度比平时要慢。罗丝匆匆地摘下简单的女帽，如平常一样坐在钢琴边。她的手指飞快地在键盘上掠过，这样心不在焉地持续了几分钟，然后开始弹奏一首低沉而严肃的曲子。当她弹奏时，大家仿佛听到她在哭泣。","One beautiful night, when they had taken a longer walk than was customary with them: for the day had been unusually warm, and there was a brilliant moon, and a light wind had sprung up, which was unusually refreshing.Rose had been in high spirits, too, and they had walked on, in merry conversation, until they had far exceeded their ordinary bounds.Mrs. Maylie being fatigued, they returned more slowly home.The young lady merely throwing off her simple bonnet, sat down to the piano as usual.After running abstractedly over the keys for a few minutes, she fell into a low and very solemn air; and as she played it, they heard a sound as if she were weeping."
"“罗丝，亲爱的！”老太太说道。","“Rose, my dear!” said the elder lady."
"罗丝没有回答，略微加快了速度，仿佛这句话把她从一些痛苦的思绪中唤醒似的。","Rose made no reply, but played a little quicker, as though the words had roused her from some painful thoughts."
"“罗丝，我的宝贝！”梅莱太太喊道，她急急忙忙地站起来，将身子贴近罗丝。“怎么啦？你哭了！亲爱的孩子，什么事让你这么伤心？”","“Rose, my love!” cried Mrs. Maylie, rising hastily, and bending over her.“What is this?In tears!My dear child, what distresses you?”"
"“没什么，婶婶，没什么。”年轻小姐回答说，“我不知道是怎么回事，我说不上来，但是我觉得——”“不是生病了吧，亲爱的？”梅莱太太插话道。","“Nothing, aunt; nothing,” replied the young lady.“I don’t know what it is; I can’t describe it; but I feel—” “Not ill, my love?” interposed Mrs. Maylie."
"“不是，不是！“哦，我没有生病！”罗丝回答说。她说话的时候浑身直哆嗦，好像有股致命的寒气从她身上穿过似的，“我很快就会好的。请把窗户关上！”奥利弗急忙关上窗户。罗丝努力恢复愉悦的心情，试图弹奏一支比较轻松活泼的曲子，可是她的手指却无力地落在了键盘上。她双手掩面，瘫在沙发上，她再也抑制不住了，泪水倾泻而出。","“No, no!“Oh, not ill!” replied Rose: shuddering as though some deadly chillness were passing over her, while she spoke; “I shall be better presently.Close the window, pray!”Oliver hastened to comply with her request. The young lady, making an effort to recover her cheerfulness, strove to play some livelier tune; but her fingers dropped powerless over the keys.Covering her face with her hands, she sank upon a sofa, and gave vent to the tears which she was now unable to repress."
"“我的孩子！”老太太说道，把她抱在怀里，“我以前从来没见过你这样。”","“My child!” said the elderly lady, folding her arms about her, “I never saw you so before.”"
"“如果我能不这样就好了，我不愿让您担心，”罗丝回答说，“实际上我已经很努力地控制了，可还是忍不住。我恐怕是——病了，婶婶。”","“I would not alarm you if I could avoid it,” rejoined Rose; “but indeed I have tried very hard, and cannot help this.I fear I—am—ill, aunt.”"
"她确实病了。当蜡烛拿上来时，他们发现从散步回来，这么短的时间里，她的脸色已经变得和大理石一样苍白。她的容貌丝毫没有失去原有的美丽，但脸色确实变了。那温和的脸上满是焦虑、憔悴，这是以前从未有过的神色。过了一分钟，她脸上出现一片绯红，温柔的蓝眼睛里，眼神变得非常狂野。不一会儿，这一切像浮云投下的阴影一样，再次消失了。她的脸色又变得像死人一样惨白。","She was, indeed; for, when candles were brought, they saw that in the very short time which had elapsed since their return home, the hue of her countenance had changed to a marble whiteness.Its expression had lost nothing of its beauty; but it was changed; and there was an anxious haggard look about the gentle face, which it had never worn before.Another minute, and it was suffused with a crimson flush: and a heavy wildness came over the soft blue eye.Again this disappeared, like the shadow thrown by a passing cloud; and she was once more deadly pale."
"奥利弗忧心忡忡地望着老太太，察觉到她因为罗丝的脸色而显得很惊慌。事实上，奥利弗自己也是一样。但是他看到老太太尽量装出没事的样子，他也努力学着做，而这样做果然有效，当梅莱太太劝罗丝上床睡觉的时候，罗丝的精神已经好些了，甚至看上去脸色也好多了。罗丝叫他们放心，说是第二天早上起床时肯定就好了。“我希望，”梅莱太太回来后，奥利弗说，“没什么事吧？她今晚看上去脸色不太好，但是——”老太太摆手叫他不要再说了，然后她在房间里一个昏暗的角落坐下来，一言不发地呆了好一阵。最后，她用颤抖的声音说：“我也希望没事，奥利弗。我和她一起生活的这些年，过得很快乐，也许太快乐了。现在也许到了我该承受某种不幸的时候了，但我希望不会是这个。”","Oliver, who watched the old lady anxiously, observed that she was alarmed by these appearances; and so in truth, was he; but seeing that she affected to make light of them, he endeavoured to do the same, and they so far succeeded, that when Rose was persuaded by her aunt to retire for the night, she was in better spirits; and appeared even in better health: assuring them that she felt certain she should rise in the morning, quite well.“I hope,” said Oliver, when Mrs. Maylie returned, “that nothing is the matter?She don’t look well to-night, but—” The old lady motioned to him not to speak; and sitting herself down in a dark corner of the room, remained silent for some time.At length, she said, in a trembling voice: “I hope not, Oliver.I have been very happy with her for some years: too happy, perhaps.It may be time that I should meet with some misfortune; but I hope it is not this.”"
"“什么？”奥利弗问。","“What?” inquired Oliver."
"“沉重的打击，”老太太说，“失去这个宝贝姑娘的沉重打击，这么多年来她一直是我的安慰和幸福。”","“The heavy blow,” said the old lady, “of losing the dear girl who has so long been my comfort and happiness.”"
"“哦！上帝不会允许的！”奥利弗脱口而出。","“Oh!God forbid!” exclaimed Oliver, hastily."
"“但愿如此，我的孩子！”老太太搓着双手说道。","“Amen to that, my child!” said the old lady, wringing her hands."
"“绝对不会存在任何如此可怕的事吧？”奥利弗说，“两个小时前，她还很好呢。”","“Surely there is no danger of anything so dreadful?” said Oliver.“Two hours ago, she was quite well.”"
"“可现在她病得很厉害！”梅莱太太说，“而且我肯定病情还会加重。我亲爱的，宝贝罗丝！啊，没有她我可怎么办！”","“She is very ill now,” rejoined Mrs. Maylies; “and will be worse, I am sure.My dear, dear Rose!Oh, what shall I do without her!”"
"她不禁悲伤万分，奥利弗只好抑制住自己的情感，硬着头皮去劝慰她，真诚地恳求她，为了这位年轻的可爱姑娘，她应该更加冷静。","She gave way to such great grief, that Oliver, suppressing his own emotion, ventured to remonstrate with her; and to beg, earnestly, that, for the sake of the dear young lady herself, she would be more calm."
"“您想一想，夫人，”奥利弗怎么忍也忍不住，泪水不受控制地涌进眼睛里，说道，“哦！想一想她那么年轻，那么善良，给她身边所有的人又带来了那么多的欢乐和安慰。我相信——肯定地——十分肯定地——相信，为了同样善良的您，为了她自己，也为了因她而幸福的人们，她绝不会死的。上帝也绝不会让她在这么年轻的时候就死去。”","“And consider, ma’am,” said Oliver, as the tears forced themselves into his eyes, despite of his efforts to the contrary.“Oh! consider how young and good she is, and what pleasure and comfort she gives to all about her.I am sure—certain—quite certain—that, for your sake, who are so good yourself; and for her own; and for the sake of all she makes so happy; she will not die.Heaven will never let her die so young.”"
"“别说了！”梅莱太太把一只手放在奥利弗的头上说，“你的想法太幼稚了，可怜的孩子。但无论如何，你让我看到了我的职责。我一时把它给忘了，奥利弗。但愿我能得到宽恕。我年纪大了，已经看够了病魔和死亡，深知与我们所爱的人分离有多么痛苦。我也看够了这种情况，知道最年轻和最善良的人未必会因有那些爱他们的人而得以幸免。不过，在我们悲痛时，这一点能让我们感到安慰，因为上帝是公正的。这些事情令人难以忘怀，告诉我们，还有一个世界比这个世界更加光明，而且人们能够很快地到那里去。上帝的意志必须服从！我爱她，上帝对此了如指掌！”","“Hush!” said Mrs. Maylie, laying her hand on Oliver’s head.“You think like a child, poor boy.But you teach me my duty, notwithstanding.I had forgotten it for a moment, Oliver, but I hope I may be pardoned, for I am old, and have seen enough of illness and death to know the agony of separation from the objects of our love.I have seen enough, too, to know that it is not always the youngest and best who are spared to those that love them; but this should give us comfort in our sorrow; for Heaven is just; and such things teach us, impressively, that there is a brighter world than this; and that the passage to it is speedy.God’s will be done!I love her; and He knows how well!”"
"奥利弗诧异地发现，梅莱太太说出这番话时似乎在努力抑制自己的悲伤，而且她直起身子，变得镇定和坚强起来。这种坚强一直在延续，梅莱太太对紧接下来的照料和看护做了充分的准备，镇定自若而且从容不迫，就外表看来甚至是兴致勃勃地履行她所肩负的一切职责，奥利弗对此更为惊奇。可是他还年轻，还不懂得人们在逆境中能表现出多么坚强的意志。可拥有坚强意志的人都很难了解他们自己，奥利弗又怎能懂得呢？","Oliver was surprised to see that as Mrs. Maylie said these words, she checked her lamentations as though by one effort; and drawing herself up as she spoke, became composed and firm.He was still more astonished to find that this firmness lasted; and that, under all the care and watching which ensued, Mrs. Maylie was every ready and collected: performing all the duties which had devolved upon her, steadily, and, to all external appearances, even cheerfully.But he was young, and did not know what strong minds are capable of, under trying circumstances.How should he, when their possessors so seldom know themselves?"
"接踵而至的是一个令人忧虑不安的夜晚。 早晨来临时，梅莱太太的预言得到了充分证实。罗丝处于一种危险的高热病的初发阶段。","An anxious night ensued.When morning came, Mrs. Maylie’s predictions were but too well verified.Rose was in the first stage of a high and dangerous fever."
"“我们必须积极主动，奥利弗，不可以屈服于徒劳的悲伤。”梅莱太太将一只手指放在嘴唇上，目不转睛地盯着奥利弗的脸，说，“这封信必须以最快的速度送到罗斯伯力先生手里。必须先将它送到集镇。若穿过田野走小路的话，集镇离这里最多四英里。然后派邮差骑马快递，直达彻特西。客栈里的人会负责安排这件事。你要亲眼看着他们把信发出去，我相信你做得到。”","“We must be active, Oliver, and not give way to useless grief,” said Mrs. Maylie, laying her finger on her lip, as she looked steadily into his face; “this letter must be sent, with all possible expedition, to Mr. Losberne.It must be carried to the market-town: which is not more than four miles off, by the footpath across the field: and thence dispatched, by an express on horseback, straight to Chertsey.The people at the inn will undertake to do this: and I can trust to you to see it done, I know.”"
"奥利弗一时说不出话来，不过看上去他脸上的忧愁马上烟消云散了。","Oliver could make no reply, but looked his anxiety to be gone at once."
"“这里还有一封信，”梅莱太太停下来想了一下，说道，“不过，我也拿不定主意，是现在送去，还是等我观察观察罗丝的病情变化后再说。除非我所担心的最坏情况发生了，否则我就不把这封信寄出去。”","“Here is another letter,” said Mrs. Maylie, pausing to reflect; “but whether to send it now, or wait until I see how Rose goes on, I scarcely know.I would not forward it, unless I feared the worst.”"
"“这封信也是发往彻特西吗，夫人？”奥利弗问道，他急于执行自己的任务，伸出一只颤抖的手要接这封信。","“Is it for Chertsey, too, ma’am?” inquired Oliver; impatient to execute his commission, and holding out his trembling hand for the letter."
"“不是。”老太太回答道，机械地把信交给了他。奥利弗扫了一眼那个信封，发现是寄给乡下某个贵族庄园的哈里·梅莱先生的，具体在什么地方他也弄不清。","“No,” replied the old lady, giving it to him mechanically.Oliver glanced at it, and saw that it was directed to Harry Maylie, Esquire, at some great lord’s house in the country; where, he could not make out."
"“这封信也要发出去吗，夫人？”奥利弗焦急地抬起头来问道。","“Shall it go, ma’am?” asked Oliver, looking up, impatiently."
"“我看还是先别发出去。”梅莱太太说着，又把信收回去。“等到明天再说。”","“I think not,” replied Mrs. Maylie, taking it back.“I will wait until to-morrow.”"
"说完，她把钱包交给奥利弗。奥利弗没有再耽搁什么，立刻以他最快的速度出发了。","With these words, she gave Oliver her purse, and he started off, without more delay, at the greatest speed he could muster."
"他飞速地穿过田野，沿着乡间小道奔跑。这些小道有时候几乎被两边高高的庄稼遮住，有时候则出现在一片开阔的田野上，有一些割草的人和晒干草的人正在那里忙着农活。除了有时停几秒钟喘口气外，他不曾停下来，直到他满身尘土地跑到那座镇上的小集市。 ","Swiftly he ran across the fields, and down the little lanes which sometimes divided them: now almost hidden by the high corn on either side, and now emerging on an open field, where the mowers and haymakers were busy at their work:nor did he stop once, save now and then, for a few seconds, to recover breath, until he came, in a great heat, and covered with dust, on the little market-place of the market-town."
"他在这里停下来，四处寻找客栈。有一幢白色的房子是银行，一幢红色的房子是酿酒厂，一幢黄色的房子是镇公所。在街角处有一座大房子，木头部分全部漆成了绿色，房子前面的招牌上写着“乔治客栈”。他一看到这块招牌，就立即往那里奔去。","Here he paused, and looked about for the inn.There were a white bank, and a red brewery, and a yellow town-hall; and in one corner there was a large house, with all the wood about it painted green: before which was the sign of “The George.”To this he hastened, as soon as it caught his eye."
"他询问了一个正在门口打盹儿的邮差。邮差听了他要办的事后叫他去找马夫。马夫听了他又一次陈述来由后，叫他去找客栈老板。客栈老板个子高高的，系着蓝领结，戴着白帽子，穿着土黄色的马裤，脚上长筒靴子的靴面和马裤颜色相配，他倚在马厩门边的水泵上，正在用银牙签剔牙。","He spoke to a postboy who was dozing under the gateway; and who, after hearing what he wanted, referred him to the ostler; who after hearing all he had to say again, referred him to the landlord;who was a tall gentleman in a blue neckcloth, a white hat, drab breeches, and boots with tops to match, leaning against a pump by the stable-door, picking his teeth with a silver toothpick."
"这位先生慢吞吞地走进酒吧间去开账单，花了很长时间。等付了帐之后，得给马套上鞍，邮差还得穿好衣服，这样足足又花了十几分钟。与此同时，奥利弗焦急不堪，忧心如焚，恨不得亲自跨上那匹马，不顾一切地飞奔到下一站。终于，一切准备就绪，那个小包裹递上去了。奥利弗又是吩咐，又是恳求，要求迅速地把信送出去，邮差这才策马哒哒哒地越过集市高低不平的石子路，几分钟之后便出了镇，沿着收税大道疾驰而去。","This gentleman walked with much deliberation into the bar to make out the bill: which took a long time making out: and after it was ready, and paid, a horse had to be saddled, and a man to be dressed, which took up ten good minutes more.Meanwhile Oliver was in such a desperate state of impatience and anxiety, that he felt as if he could have jumped upon the horse himself, and galloped away, full tear, to the next stage.At length, all was ready; and the little parcel having been handed up, with many injunctions and entreaties for its speedy delivery, the man set spurs to his horse, and rattling over the uneven paving of the market-place, was out of the town, and galloping along the turnpike-road, in a couple of minutes."
"奥利弗确信请求救援的信已经发出去了，而且也没有耽搁时间，就怀着稍微轻松一点的心情匆匆走过客栈的院子。他正要在院子的大门口转弯时，却意外地撞在一个裹着斗篷的高个子男人身上。这个人此刻正从客栈走出来。","As it was something to feel certain that assistance was sent for, and that no time had been lost, Oliver hurried up the inn-yard, with a somewhat lighter heart.He was turning out of the gateway when he accidently stumbled against a tall man wrapped in a cloak, who was at that moment coming out of the inn door."
"“嘿！”男人喊道，眼睛直直地盯着奥利弗，突然往后退。“搞什么鬼名堂？”","“Hah!” cried the man, fixing his eyes on Oliver, and suddenly recoiling.“What the devil’s this?”"
"“对不起，先生，”奥利弗说道，“我急着往家赶，没有看见你走过来。”","“I beg your pardon, sir,” said Oliver; “I was in a great hurry to get home, and didn’t see you were coming.”"
"“要死呀！”男人喃喃自语道，睁着一双乌黑的大眼睛盯着这个孩子。“谁会料到有这样的事！把他磨成灰！否则他还会从石棺里蹦出来挡住我的去路！”","“Death!” muttered the man to himself, glaring at the boy with his large dark eyes.“Who would have thought it!Grind him to ashes!He’d start up from a stone coffin, to come in my way!”"
"“对不起。”奥利弗结结巴巴地说，这个怪人疯狂的神色扰得他心慌意乱。“但愿我没有伤到您！”","“I am sorry,” stammered Oliver, confused by the strange man’s wild look.“I hope I have not hurt you!”"
"“混蛋！”男人暴跳如雷、咬牙切齿地嘟囔道，“要是我过去有勇气说这话，我一个晚上就能摆脱你。我诅咒你，灾祸降临到你头上，黑死病降临到你心脏里，你这个小魔鬼！你在这儿干什么？”","“Rot you!” murmured the man, in a horrible passion; between his clenched teeth; “if I had only had the courage to say the word, I might have been free of you in a night.Curses on your head, and black death on your heart, you imp!What are you doing here?”"
"这男人一边语无伦次地说着这些话，一边挥舞着拳头。他朝奥利弗走过来，好像想要给他一拳，可是他却突然重重地瘫倒在地，满地打滚，口吐白沫。","The man shook his fist, as he uttered these words incoherently.He advanced towards Oliver, as if with the intention of aiming a blow at him, but fell violently on the ground: writhing and foaming, in a fit."
"奥利弗呆呆地看了一会儿这个疯子（奥利弗以为他是个疯子）在地上挣扎，然后便飞奔到屋里求救。见到他被安全地抬进客栈后，奥利弗才掉头往回走。他尽可能快地一路奔跑，以便把刚才耽误的时间补回来。同时，带着极大的惊奇和些许后怕，他回想着刚刚离开的那个男人的古怪行为。","Oliver gazed, for a moment, at the struggles of the madman (for such he supposed him to be); and then darted into the house for help.Having seen him safely carried into the hotel, he turned his face homewards, running as fast as he could, to make up for lost time: and recalling with a great deal of astonishment and some fear, the extraordinary behaviour of the person from whom he had just parted."
"然而，这件事并没有在他的脑海中停留很久，因为当他回到村舍时，太多的事情让他牵挂着，他完全没有考虑自身的余地。","The circumstance did not dwell in his recollection long, however: for when he reached the cottage, there was enough to occupy his mind, and to drive all considerations of self completely from his memory."
"罗丝·梅莱的病情迅速恶化，还没到午夜，她已经神志不清了。一位当地的医生昼夜护理着她。他第一次给她看病之后，就把梅莱太太拉到一边，告诉她罗丝的病情十分令人担心。“事实上，”他说道，“如果她痊愈了，那简直是奇迹。”","Rose Maylie had rapidly grown worse; before mid-night she was delirious.A medical practitioner, who resided on the spot, was in constant attendance upon her; and after first seeing the patient, he had taken Mrs. Maylie aside, and pronounced her disorder to be one of a most alarming nature.“In fact,” he said, “it would be little short of a miracle, if she recovered.”"
"那天夜里，奥利弗有多少回从床上跳起来，悄悄地溜到楼梯口，不发出一丝声响，倾听从病室里传出的最微弱的气息声！不知有多少回他被突然响起的脚步声吓得浑身哆嗦，额头直冒冷汗。他担心那可怕的、令人不敢想象的事情已经发生了！他怀着极大的痛苦和悲哀，为那位正徘徊在深深的坟墓边缘的温柔的姑娘祈祷，祈求让她恢复生机，身体健康。在热切程度上，他过去曾经做过的一切祈祷与此相比都差得太远了！","How often did Oliver start from his bed that night, and stealing out, with noiseless footstep, to the staircase, listen for the slightest sound from the sick chamber!How often did a tremble shake his frame, and cold drops of terror start upon his brow, when a sudden trampling of feet caused him to fear that something too dreadful to think of, had even then occurred!And what had been the fervency of all the prayers he had ever muttered, compared with those he poured forth, now, in the agony and passion of his supplication for the life and health of the gentle creature, who was tottering on the deep grave’s verge!"
"噢！当我们深爱的人的生命处于危急之中的时候，那种站在一边束手无策的极度焦虑实在可怕。噢！脑海里浮现出的影像令那些极为痛苦的想法涌上心头，让人心跳加剧、呼吸急促。那不顾一切的渴望从心底发出——急于想做些什么，以减轻我们无力减轻的痛苦或减少我们无力减少的危险。我们悲痛地回想着我们无能为力时，心灵和精神都陷入颓丧，还有什么折磨能与此相比。在这最紧要、最关键的时刻，什么样的想法或者努力能够减轻这种痛苦呢！","Oh! the suspense, the fearful, acute suspense, of standing idly by while the life of one we dearly love, is trembling in the balance!Oh! the racking thoughts that crowd upon the mind, and make the heart beat violently, and the breath come thick, by the force of the images they conjure up before it; the desparate anxiety—to be doing something—to relieve the pain, or lessen the danger, which we have no power to alleviate;the sinking of soul and spirit, which the sad remembrance of our helplessness produces; what tortures can equal these; what reflections or endeavours can, in the full tide and fever of the time, allay them!"
"早晨来临了，小村舍孤零零的，一片寂静。人们低声地交谈，焦虑的面孔不时地出现在大门口，妇女和孩子们都含着眼泪离去。整整一个白天，以及天黑后的几个小时里，奥利弗都轻轻地在花园里来回踱步。每一刻，他都要抬起头来望望那个病室，战栗地看着昏暗的窗户。看上去死神好像已经伸展着四肢躺在房子里面了。夜深了，罗斯伯力先生终于来了。“这太残酷了，”好心的医生把头转向一边说，“这么年轻，人们这么喜爱她，但看来希望渺茫。”","Morning came; and the little cottage was lonely and still.People spoke in whispers; anxious faces appeared at the gate, from time to time; women and children went away in tears.All the livelong day, and for hours after it had grown dark, Oliver paced softly up and down the garden, raising his eyes every instant to the sick chamber, and shuddering to see the darkened window, looking as if death lay stretched inside.Late that night, Mr. Losberne arrived.“It is hard,” said the good doctor, turning away as he spoke; “so young; so much beloved; but there is very little hope.”"
"又一个早晨到来了。阳光灿烂，仿佛看不到任何痛苦或忧伤。园中枝叶茂盛、繁花似锦，一派生机勃勃、精神焕发的气象，到处也都充斥着欢乐的声音和景色。可是美丽的、年轻的小姐正躺在病榻上，身体迅速地衰弱下去。奥利弗蹑手蹑脚地走进古老的教堂墓地，在其中一座绿草萋萋的坟前坐下，默默地为她垂泪、为她祈祷。","Another morning.The sun shone brightly; as brightly as if it looked upon no misery or care; and, with every leaf and flower in full bloom about her; with life, and health, and sounds and sights of joy, surrounding her on every side: the fair young creature lay, wasting fast. Oliver crept away to the old churchyard, and sitting down on one of the green mounds, wept and prayed for her, in silence."
"景色如此寂静、优美。阳光照耀下的风景如此璀璨夺目、一派喜悦，夏日百鸟的歌声如此轻快悦耳，从头顶急速翱翔的白嘴鸦也是如此自由自在。世间万物都生机勃勃、充满愉悦。当孩子抬起发疼的双眼环顾四周时，他本能地想到，这不是死亡的时刻。既然这些小东西都能如此的欢畅，罗丝肯定不会死的；坟墓只适合寒冷和阴郁的冬天，与阳光和芳香是格格不入的。他几乎认为，裹尸布只是用来裹住老朽、皱缩的尸体的，那可怕的褶层从来不会包裹年轻而优美的躯体。","There was such peace and beauty in the scene; so much of brightness and mirth in the sunny landscape; such blithesome music in the songs of the summer birds; such freedom in the rapid flight of the rook, careering overhead; so much of life and joyousness in all;that, when the boy raised his aching eyes, and looked about, the thought instinctively occurred to him, that this was not a time for death; that Rose could surely never die when humbler things were all so glad and gay; that graves were for cold and cheerless winter: not for sunlight and fragrance.He almost thought that shrouds were for the old and shrunken; and that they never wrapped the young and graceful form in their ghastly folds."
"教堂的丧钟敲响了，无情地打断了他这些稚嫩的思绪。又一声！再一声！这是为葬礼而鸣。一群出身卑微的哀悼者走进墓地大门，身上佩戴着白色花结，因为死者还很年轻。他们脱帽伫立在坟墓旁；在哭泣的出殡行列中有一位母亲——痛失孩子的母亲。但是阳光依然灿烂，百鸟仍然在歌唱。","A knell from the church bell broke harshly on these youthful thoughts.Another!Again!It was tolling for the funeral service.A group of humble mourners entered the gate: wearing white favours; for the corpse was young.They stood uncovered by a grave; and there was a mother—a mother once—among the weeping train.But the sun shone brightly, and the birds sang on."
"奥利弗掉头往回走，回忆着年轻的小姐给予他的诸多帮助，渴望再有这样的机会，让他可以不停地向她表示他对她是多么的感激和依恋。他没有理由为自己的怠慢或考虑不周而自责，因为他始终一心一意地为她效劳。然而，许多微小的场合浮现在他眼前。在那些场合中，他想象自己本来可以更热情些、更真挚些，可惜他没有。每当一个人去世，总会使某个小圈子里还活着的人想到有那么多的事被忽略了，那么多的事还没有做，还有那么多的事被遗忘了，那么多的事本来是可以弥补的。因此我们必须十分留意应如何对待我们身边的人。再也没有什么比徒劳的后悔更令人痛心的了。倘若我们希望不再遭受这种折磨，那我们就应该及时地记住这一点。","Oliver turned homeward, thinking on the many kindnesses he had received from the young lady, and wishing that the time could come again, that he might never cease showing her how grateful and attached he was.He had no cause for self-reproach on the score of neglect, or want of thought, for he had been devoted to her service; and yet a hundred little occasions rose up before him, on which he fancied he might have been more zealous, and more earnest, and wished he had been.We need be careful how we deal with those about us, when every death carries to some small circle of survivors, thoughts of so much omitted, and so little done—of so many things forgotten, and so many more which might have been repaired!There is no remorse so deep as that which is unavailing; if we would be spared its tortures, let us remember this, in time."
"他到家时，梅莱太太正坐在小客厅里。一看到她，奥利弗的心就猛地沉了下去，因为梅莱太太从未离开侄女的病榻半步。一想到肯定是有什么变化才会促使她离开，他便浑身发抖。他获悉罗丝已经酣睡，她会从酣睡中醒来。那时，她要么痊愈并活过来，要么就是向他们告别，与世长辞。","When he reached home Mrs. Maylie was sitting in the little parlour.Oliver’s heart sank at sight of her; for she had never left the bedside of her niece; and he trembled to think what change could have driven her away.He learnt that she had fallen into a deep sleep, from which she would waken, either to recovery and life, or to bid them farewell, and die."
"接连几个小时，他们就坐在那里仔细倾听，不敢说话。饭菜原封不动地撤了回去。他们心不在焉地看着太阳逐渐沉没，最终，向天空和大地投射出宣布离去的万道霞光。他们灵敏地听到有人朝他们走过来，脚步越来越近。罗斯伯力先生进来时，他们都不由自主地冲到门口。","They sat, listening, and afraid to speak, for hours.The untasted meal was removed, with looks which showed that their thoughts were elsewhere, they watched the sun as he sank lower and lower, and, at length, cast over sky and earth those brilliant hues which herald his departure.Their quick ears caught the sound of an approaching footstep.They both involuntarily darted to the door, as Mr. Losberne entered."
"“罗丝怎么样了？”老太太叫道，“马上告诉我！我能受得了，就是不想再这样担心了！噢，告诉我吧！看在上帝的份上！","“What of Rose?” cried the old lady.“Tell me at once!I can bear it; anything but suspense!Oh, tell me! in the name of Heaven!"
"“你必须镇定。”医生扶着她说，“请保持镇定，亲爱的太太。”","“You must compose yourself,” said the doctor supporting her.“Be calm, my dear ma’am, pray.”"
"“看在上帝的份上，放开我！我亲爱的孩子！她死啦！她快死啦！”","“Let me go, in God’s name!My dear child!She is dead!She is dying!”"
"“不！”医生激动地喊道，“上帝是善良而慈悲的，所以她今后还能活很多年，来为我们大家祝福。”","“No!” cried the doctor, passionately.“As He is good and merciful, she will live to bless us all, for years to come.”"
"老夫人跪倒在地，想把双手交叉起来。可是，这么久以来支撑她的那点力气随着她第一声感恩的祷词飞上了天庭。她倒在了友好地向她伸出手臂的朋友怀中。","The lady fell upon her knees, and tried to fold her hands together; but the energy which had supported her so long, fled up to Heaven with her first thanksgiving; and she sank into the friendly arms which were extended to receive her."
"第三十四章 介绍一位新登场的年轻先生的相关情况和奥利弗一次新的奇遇","CHAPTER XXXIV Contains some introductory particulars relative to a young gentleman who now arrives upon the scene; and a new adventure which happened to Oliver   "
"这样的大喜事，几乎超出了人的承受能力。这意想不到的消息竟然使奥利弗目瞪口呆，茫然不知所措。他哭也哭不出来，说也说不出来，坐卧不安。","It was almost too much happiness to bear.Oliver felt stunned and stupefied by the unexpected intelligence; he could not weep, or speak, or rest."
"他几乎无法理解他所经历的这一切事情，直到他在宁静的夜空下漫步很久，如雨的泪水迸发出来，使他略得宽慰，他这才似乎突然清醒过来，充分意识到令人欢欣的变化已经发生了，并感觉到一直压在心头的、让自己无法忍受的痛苦终于消失了。夜幕迅速降临了，他朝着家的方向往回走，怀里抱着一大堆为了装饰病室而精心采摘的花。当他沿着那条路正轻快地走着时，听到后面有马车飞驰而过的声音。他一回头，看到一辆急速前行的驿车，由于马跑得很快，道路又窄，他不得不靠在一个门上站着，让马车过去。","He had scarcely the power of understanding anything that had passed, until, after a long ramble in the quiet evening air, a burst of tears came to his relief, and he seemed to awaken, all at once, to a full sense of the joyful change that had occurred, and the almost insupportable load of anguish which had been taken from his breast. The night was fast closing in, when he returned homeward: laden with flowers which he had culled, with peculiar care, for the adornment of the sick chamber.As he walked briskly along the road, he heard behind him, the noise of some vehicle, approaching at a furious pace.Looking round, he saw that it was a post-chaise, driven at great speed; and as the horses were galloping, and the road was narrow, he stood leaning against a gate until it should have passed him."
"马车从奥利弗面前猛冲过去，他看到一个戴着白睡帽的男人在眼前一晃，看上去很面熟，但因为时间太仓促，他无法辨认出那是什么人。过了一两秒钟，那白睡帽从马车的窗口探出来，用洪亮的声音大叫着让车夫停车。车夫立即勒住马，让马车停下来。然后那个白睡帽又出现在窗口，用同样洪亮的声音大喊奥利弗的名字。","As it dashed on, Oliver caught a glimpse of a man in a white nightcap, whose face seemed familiar to him, although his view was so brief that he could not identify the person.In another second or two, the nightcap was thrust out of the chaise-window, and a stentorian voice bellowed to the driver to stop: which he did, as soon as he could pull up his horses.Then, the nightcap once again appeared: and the same voice called Oliver by his name."
"“过来！”那声音喊道，“奥利弗，情况怎样？罗丝小姐怎么样？奥——利——弗少爷！”","“Here!” cried the voice.“Oliver, what’s the news?Miss Rose!Master O-li-ver!”"
"“是你吗，贾尔斯？”奥利弗向车门跑去，大声叫道。","“Is is you, Giles?” cried Oliver, running up to the chaise-door."
"贾尔斯又探出他戴着白睡帽的脑袋，正准备回答，可这时他突然被坐在车子另一角的一位年轻先生推开，那人急着打探消息。","Giles popped out his nightcap again, preparatory to making some reply, when he was suddenly pulled back by a young gentleman who occupied the other corner of the chaise, and who eagerly demanded what was the news."
"“一句话！”那先生叫道，“好些了，还是恶化了？”","“In a word!” cried the gentleman, “Better or worse?”"
"“好些了——好多了！”奥利弗连忙回答说。","“Better—much better!” replied Oliver, hastily."
"“谢天谢地！”那先生叫喊着，“你肯定？”","“Thank Heaven!” exclaimed the gentleman.“You are sure?”"
"“非常肯定，先生。”奥利弗回答，“几个小时前情况才开始好转。罗斯伯力先生还说，一切危险都过去了。”","“Quite, sir,” replied Oliver.“The change took place only a few hours ago; and Mr. Losberne says, that all danger is at an end.”"
"那先生不再说话，只是打开车门跳下车来，匆匆抓住奥利弗的一只胳膊，把他拉到路边上去。","The gentleman said not another word, but, opening the chaise-door, leaped out, and taking Oliver hurriedly by the arm, led him aside."
"“你非常肯定吗？你没可能弄错的，孩子，是吗？”那位先生声音发颤地问道，“别骗我，让我空欢喜一场。”","“You are quite certain?There is no possibility of any mistake on your part, my boy, is there?” demanded the gentleman in a tremulous voice.“Do not deceive me, by awakening hopes that are not to be fulfilled.”"
"“说什么我也不能骗你，先生。”奥利弗说，“你真的可以相信我。罗斯伯力先生的原话是，她会活下去的，而且活很多年，为我们大家带来幸福。我听到他是这么说的。”","“I would not for the world, sir,” replied Oliver.“Indeed you may believe me.Mr. Losberne’s words were, that she would live to bless us all for many years to come.I heard him say so.”"
"奥利弗回想起当时那个成为大家无比欢喜的源泉的情景，眼里噙满了泪水。那位先生则把脸转向一边，半晌一言未发。奥利弗觉得不止一次听到那位先生哭泣的声音，但他不敢再说些什么话打断他——因为他完全可以猜出他此时的感情——因此奥利弗只是站在一边，假装在摆弄他手里的花束。","The tears stood in Oliver’s eyes as he recalled the scene which was the beginning of so much happiness; and the gentleman turned his face away, and remained silent, for some minutes.Oliver thought he heard him sob, more than once; but he feared to interrupt him by any fresh remark—for he could well guess what his feelings were—and so stood apart, feigning to be occupied with his nosegay."
"这期间，贾尔斯先生仍然戴着白睡帽，一直坐在马车的脚蹬板上，用膝盖支撑着胳膊肘，拿着一块印有白点的蓝布手巾擦眼睛。这的确是这位老实人的真情流露，而并非虚情假意。他转身对那位年轻先生说话时，露出的红眼圈就能充分地说明。","All this time, Mr. Giles, with the white nightcap on, had been sitting on the steps of the chaise, supporting an elbow on each knee, and wiping his eyes with a blue cotton pocket-handkerchief dotted with white spots.That the honest fellow had not been feigning emotion, was abundantly demonstrated by the very red eyes with which he regarded the young gentleman, when he turned round and addressed him."
"“我想你最好就坐这车到我母亲那里去，贾尔斯。”年轻的先生说，“我想慢慢地走过去，再过一会儿去见她。你就说我正过来呢。”","“I think you had better go on to my mother’s in the chaise, Giles,” said he.“I would rather walk slowly on, so as to gain a little time before I see her.You can say I am coming.”"
"“对不起，哈里先生，”贾尔斯说，用手巾最后擦了擦哭花的脸，“如果您要是让邮童去传这些话，我会感激不尽的。我不能让那些女仆看到我这番模样，先生，要是让她们看到，那往后我在她们面前就一点儿威信也没有了。”","“I beg your pardon, Mr. Harry,” said Giles: giving a final polish to his ruffled countenance with the handkerchief; “but if you would leave the postboy to say that, I should be very much obliged to you.It wouldn’t be proper for the maids to see me in this state, sir; I should never have any more authority with them if they did.”"
"“那好，”哈里·梅莱微笑着回答说，“你愿意怎么样就怎么样。如果你希望那样，那就让他拉着行李去，你跟着我们就好了。只是你得先把睡帽摘掉，换上别的更合适的帽子，否则，人家会以为我们是疯子。","“Well,” rejoined Harry Maylie, smiling, “you can do as you like.Let him go on with the luggage, if you wish it, and do you follow with us.Only first exchange that nightcap for some more appropriate covering, or we shall be taken for madmen.”"
"贾尔斯这才意识到自己的服饰有失体统，他立刻把睡帽摘下来，塞进口袋里，然后从马车里拿出一顶样式看上去很庄重的礼帽，戴上来。之后，邮差驱车而去，贾尔斯、梅莱先生和奥利弗在后面悠闲地跟着。","Mr. Giles, reminded of his unbecoming costume, snatched off and pocketed his nightcap; and substituted a hat, of grave and sober shape, which he took out of the chaise.This done, the postboy drove off; Giles, Mr. Maylie, and Oliver, followed at their leisure."
"就在他们前行的路上，奥利弗怀着极大的兴趣和好奇心时不时地瞅瞅这位新来的先生。他看上去大概二十五岁，中等身材，相貌真诚英俊，举止随和大方。尽管年轻时的模样和年迈时的存在差异，但他长得太像老太太了。即使他未提及老太太是他的母亲，奥利弗也能不费周折地猜出他们之间的母子关系。","As they walked along, Oliver glanced from time to time with much interest and curiosity at the new comer.He seemed about five-and-twenty years of age, and was of the middle height; his countenance was frank and handsome; and his demeanor easy and prepossessing.Notwithstanding the difference between youth and age, he bore so strong a likeness to the old lady, that Oliver would have had no great difficulty in imagining their relationship, if he had not already spoken of her as his mother."
"当他们一行抵达村舍时，梅莱太太正心急火燎地等着她的儿子。这次见面，母子二人都非常激动。","Mrs. Maylie was anxiously waiting to receive her son when he reached the cottage.The meeting did not take place without great emotion on both sides."
"“妈妈！”年轻人低声说道，“你为什么不早点儿给我写信？”","“Mother!” whispered the young man; “why did you not write before?”"
"“我早就写好了，”梅莱太太回答道，“可是深思熟虑后，我决定把信扣下来，等听了罗斯伯力先生的意见后再发出去。”","“I did,” replied Mrs. Maylie; “but, on reflection, I determined to keep back the letter until I had heard Mr. Losberne’s opinion.”"
"“可是为什么呢，”年轻人说道，“为什么要冒这种风险呢，这样的事差点儿就发生了！倘若罗丝已经——我现在说不出那个词——如果这场病的结果不是这样，你怎能原谅自己！我以后怎能再知道幸福是什么滋味！”","“But why,” said the young man, “why run the chance of that occurring which so nearly happened?If Rose had—I cannot utter that word now—if this illness had terminated differently, how could you ever have forgiven yourself!How could I ever have know happiness again!”"
"“如果情况真是那样的话，哈里，”梅莱太太说道，“我怕你的幸福也就全被毁了，你早一天或晚一天抵达这里就真的无关紧要了。”","“If that had been the case, Harry,” said Mrs. Maylie, “I fear your happiness would have been effectually blighted, and that your arrival here, a day sooner or a day later, would have been of very, very little import.”"
"“即使果真如此，谁会觉得奇怪呢，妈妈？”年轻人回答道，“再说，我为什么要说‘即使’呢？——这是——这是——你知道的，妈妈——你一定知道！”","“And who can wonder if it be so, mother?” rejoined the young man; “or why should I say if?—It is—it is—you know it, mother—you must know it!”"
"“我知道，她值得拥有男人能够奉献出的心中最好、最纯洁的爱情，”梅莱太太说道，“我知道，她天性中的忠诚和热情需要的也是非同一般的回报，那种回报是深刻而永恒的。如果我没有感觉到这一点，而且还知道，她所爱的人态度上有任何改变，都必将使她心碎，我也就不会在严格履行我的职责时，竟然感到如此难于尽责，或在内心深处有那么多的挣扎了。”","“I know that she deserves the best and purest love the heart of man can offer,” said Mrs. Maylie; “I know that the devotion and affection of her nature require no ordinary return, but one that shall be deep and lasting.If I did not feel this, and know, besides, that a changed behaviour in one she loved would break her heart, I should not feel my task so difficult of performance, or have to encounter so many struggles in my own bosom, when I take what seems to me to be the strict line of duty.”"
"“这不好，妈妈。”哈里说，“你还把我看成是一个孩子，以为我对自己的想法糊里糊涂的，对自己内心深处的冲动也不能正确地看待吗？”","“This is unkind, mother,” said Harry.“Do you still suppose that I am a boy ignorant of my own mind, and mistaking the impulses of my own soul?”"
"“我想，亲爱的儿子，”梅莱太太把一只手放在他的肩膀上回答说，“年轻人许多无偏见的冲动总是不会持续很久，其中有些若是得到了满足，更是转瞬即逝。特别是，我认为，”老太太直盯着她儿子的脸接着说，“如果一个满腔热情且有远大抱负的男人，娶了一个名声上有污点的妻子，尽管这污点完全不是因为她的过错造成的，但可能还是会有些残酷卑鄙的人将这污点强加于她，甚至是他的子女。而且，这个男人在这个世界上越成功，他就越可能受到众人的奚落，成为被嘲笑的对象。无论他的天性是多么大度和善良，有朝一日，他还是可能会后悔年轻时建立起的婚姻关系。而做妻子的知道他后悔了，也会很痛苦。”","“I think, my dear son,” returned Mrs. Maylie, laying her hand upon his shoulder, “that youth has many generous impulses which do not last; and that among them are some, which, being gratified, become only the more fleeting.Above all, I think” said the lady, fixing her eyes on her son’s face, “that if an enthusiastic, ardent, and ambitious man marry a wife on whose name there is a stain, which, though it originate in no fault of hers, may be visited by cold and sordid people upon her, and upon his children also:and, in exact proportion to his success in the world, be cast in his teeth, and made the subject of sneers against him: he may, no matter how generous and good his nature, one day repent of the connection he formed in early life.And she may have the pain of knowing that he does so.”"
"“妈妈，”年轻人急躁地说道，“那个有此行为的人肯定是一个自私自利的畜生，他玷污了男人的名声，也配不上你所描述的那个姑娘。”","“Mother,” said the young man, impatiently, “he would be a selfish brute, unworthy alike of the name of man and of the woman you describe, who acted thus.”"
"“这只是你现在的想法，哈里。”他母亲说道。","“You think so now, Harry,” replied his mother."
"“我永远都会这么想的！”年轻人说，“最近两天里，我遭受着精神上的折磨，迫使我坦率地向你承认自己的感情。这份感情，正如你完全明白，既不是昨天才有的，也不是我草率就产生的。我倾心于罗丝，那么甜美又温柔的女孩！我已经铁了心，像任何已经爱上女人的男人一样坚定。如果没有她，我就没有任何思想，看不见任何前途，也不会对生活有任何希望；如果你在这个重大问题上反对我，那你就是亲手夺取我的安宁和幸福，将它们抛向风中。妈妈，请再多想想这件事，想想我，请不要对我的幸福置之不理，不要把它们看得完全无足轻重。”","“And ever will!” said the young man.“The mental agony I have suffered, during the last two days, wrings from me the avowal to you of a passion which, as you well know, is not one of yesterday, nor one I have lightly formed.On Rose, sweet, gentle girl!my heart is set, as firmly as ever heart of man was set on woman.I have no thought, no view, no hope in life, beyond her; and if you oppose me in this great stake, you take my peace and happiness in your hands, and cast them to the wind.Mother, think better of this, and of me, and do not disregard the happiness of which you seem to think so little.”"
"“哈里，”梅莱太太说，“正是因为我十分重视那热情而敏感的心，我才会这样做使它们免受伤害。不过，在这件事上，我们现在已经谈得够多了，简直是太多了。”","“Harry,” said Mrs. Maylie, “it is because I think so much of warm and sensitive hearts, that I would spare them from being wounded.But we have said enough, and more than enough, on this matter, just now.”"
"“那就让罗丝来决定吧。”哈里插嘴说，“你总不会把你那紧张过度的想法强加于人，就为了给我制造任何障碍吧？”","“Let it rest with Rose, then,” interposed Harry.“You will not press these overstrained opinions of yours, so far, as to throw any obstacle in my way?”"
"“我不会，”梅莱夫人回答说，“不过我要你好好考虑一下——”“我已经考虑好了！”哈里不耐烦地回答道，“妈妈，我已经考虑好多年了。我已经考虑过了，自从我能够认真地看待事情以来，我便一直在考虑。我的感情没有改变，永远都也不会。我为什么要一再拖延，迟迟不把我的心事说出来，听任自己忍受痛苦，这样到底有什么好的？不成！在我离开前，我必须要和罗丝说说。","“I will not,” rejoined Mrs. Maylie; “but I would have you consider—” “I have considered!” was the impatient reply; “Mother, I have considered, years and years.I have considered, ever since I have been capable of serious reflection.My feelings remain unchanged, as they ever will; and why should I suffer the pain of a delay in giving them vent, which can be productive of no earthly good?No!Before I leave this place, Rose shall hear me.”"
"“她会听你说的。”梅莱太太说。","“She shall,” said Mrs. Maylie."
"“妈妈，你这样说几乎是在暗示，她对我的话反应一定很冷淡。”年轻人说。","“There is something in your manner, which would almost imply that she will hear me coldly, mother,” said the young man."
"“不是冷淡，”老太太说，“远不是冷淡。”","“Not coldly,” rejoined the old lady; “far from it.”"
"“那是怎样？”年轻人追问道，“她已经爱上别人了吗？”","“How then?” urged the young man.“She has formed no other attachment?”"
"“没有，确实没有，”他母亲说，“你已经，如果我没弄错的话，紧紧抓住了她的心。我要说的，”在她儿子正要开口说话的时候，老太太拦住他继续说道，“正是这个。在你决定碰这个运气、孤注一掷之前，在你对这件事所抱的希望，将达到最高点之前，我亲爱的孩子，稍稍想一想罗丝的过去，考虑一下如果她知道自己的出身令人怀疑的话，这会对她做出的决定产生什么影响。她品德高尚，对我们是全心全意，无论事情极为重要还是微不足道，她完全不怕做出牺牲，这就是她的性格。”","“No, indeed,” replied his mother; “you have, or I mistake, too strong a hold on her affections already.What I would say,” resumed the old lady, stopping her son as he was about to speak, “is this.Before you stake your all on this chance; before you suffer yourself to be carried to the highest point of hope; reflect for a few moments, my dear child, on Rose’s history, and consider what effect the knowledge of her doubtful birth may have on her decision:devoted as she is to us, with all the intensity of her noble mind, and with that perfect sacrifice of self which, in all matters, great or trifling, has always been her characteristic.”"
"“您想说什么？”","“What do you mean?”"
"“这留给你自己去琢磨吧。”梅莱太太回答道，“我必须回到她身边了。愿上帝保佑你！”","“That I leave you to discover,” replied Mrs. Maylie.“I must go back to her.God bless you!”"
"“我今晚再去找你，行吗？”年轻人急切地说。","“I shall see you again to-night?” said the young man, eagerly."
"“到时候再说，”老太太回答，“在我离开罗丝之后。”","“By and by,” replied the lady; “when I leave Rose.”"
"“你会告诉她我在这儿吗？”哈里说。","“You will tell her I am here?” said Harry."
"“当然。”梅莱太太回答。","“Of course,” replied Mrs. Maylie."
"“还有告诉她我多么焦急，多么痛苦，多么想见到她。你不会拒绝这样做的吧，妈妈？”","“And say how anxious I have been, and how much I have suffered, and how I long to see her.You will not refuse to do this, mother?”"
"“不会，”老太太说，“我全都会告诉她的。”她体贴地捏了捏儿子的手，便匆匆走出房间。","“No,” said the old lady; “I will tell her all.”And pressing her son’s hand, affectionately, she hastened from the room."
"在这段对话匆匆忙忙地进行时，罗斯伯力先生和奥利弗一直呆在房间的另一端。现在，罗斯伯力先生向哈里·梅莱伸出手来，两人彼此热情地、诚挚地问候。然后，医生与他年轻的朋友交谈着，回答了他的各种问题，并把病人的病情全部告诉了他。正像奥利弗的话曾使他充满希望一样，这些情况对他来说是莫大的安慰，更使他信心百倍。而在一旁装着忙于收拾行李的贾尔斯，一直竖着耳朵凝听所有的话。","Mr. Losberne and Oliver had remained at another end of the apartment while this hurried conversation was proceeding.The former now held out his hand to Harry Maylie; and hearty salutations were exchanged between them.The doctor then communicated, in reply to multifarious questions from his young friend, a precise account of his patient’s s situation; which was quite as consolatory and full of promise, as Oliver’s statement had encouraged him to hope; and to the whole of which, Mr. Giles, who affected to be busy about the luggage, listened with greedy ears."
"“最近又开枪打中什么特别的东西了吗，贾尔斯？”医生说完话后问道。","“Have you shot anything particular, lately, Giles?” inquired the doctor, when he had concluded."
"“没什么特别的，先生。”贾尔斯满脸通红地回答说。","“Nothing particular, sir,” replied Mr. Giles, colouring up to the eyes."
"“既没有抓到小偷，也没有认出破门行窃的盗贼？”医生问。","“Nor catching any thieves, nor identifying any house-breakers?” siad the doctor."
"“都没有，先生。”贾尔斯先生十分严肃地说。","“None at all, sir,” replied Mr. Giles, with much gravity."
"“那么，”医生说，“听起来真遗憾，因为你在这方面堪称高手。请问布里特尔斯怎么样了？”","“Well,” said the doctor, “I am sorry to hear it, because you do that sort of thing admirably.Pray, how is Brittles?”"
"“那个孩子很好，先生，”贾尔斯先生又恢复了原来的施恩似的的声调说，“他让我向您问好，先生。”","“The boy is very well, sir,” said Mr. Giles, recovering his usual tone of patronage; “and sends his respectful duty, sir.”"
"“很好。”医生说，“在这儿看到你，贾尔斯先生，让我想起，在我被匆忙叫走的前一天，你家善良的女主人请求我为你办了件事。咱们到这个角落呆一会儿，好吗？”","“That’s well,” said the doctor.“Seeing you here, reminds me, Mr. Giles, that on the day before that on which I was called away so hurriedly, I executed, at the request of your good mistress, a small commission in your favour.Just step into this corner a moment, will you?”"
"贾尔斯先生感觉关系重大，带着几分惊异，走到那个角落，荣幸地和大夫进行短暂的耳语。谈完后，他向大夫连连鞠躬，迈着不同寻常的、庄严的步伐退下了。这次交谈的话题没有在客厅里透露，可是相关消息在厨房里很快就传开了。因为贾尔斯先生径直走到厨房，要了一杯啤酒，显得十分气派且很恰到时机地宣布，他的女主人对于他在那次未遂的盗窃案中的英勇表现，感到十分欣慰，并在当地的储蓄银行里为他，并且仅供他使用，存入了二十五英镑。听到这话，两个女仆抬起双手，眼皮向上翻，想象着贾尔斯先生一定会显得十分得意。而实际上贾尔斯先生却拉出塞在裤腰里的衬衫说道：“不会，不会。”还说，她们要是看到他对下人们表现出傲慢的神态，就直接相告，他会感激不尽的。接着他又说了许多同样表示谦逊的话，受到了大家的欢迎，引起一片叫好声。大家认为他就像大人物们一样，讲的话别出心裁，切中要害。","Mr. Giles walked into the corner with much importance, and some wonder, and was honoured with a short whispering conference with the doctor, on the termination of which, he made a great many bows, and retired with steps of unusual stateliness.The subject matter of this conference was not disclosed in the parlour, but the kitchen was speedily enlightened concerning it; for Mr. Giles walked straight thither, and having called for a mug of ale, announced, with an air of majesty, which was highly effective, that it had pleased his mistress, in consideration of his gallant behaviour on the occasion of that attempted robbery, to deposit, in the local savings-bank, the sum of five-and-twenty pounds, for his sole use and benefit.At this, the two women-servants lifted up their hands and eyes, and supposed that Mr. Giles, pulling out his shirt-frill, replied, “No, no”; and that if they observed that he was at all haughty to his inferiors, he would thank them to tell him so.And then he made a great many other remarks, no less illustrative of his humility, which were received with equal favour and applause, and were, withal, as original and as much to the purpose, as the remarks of great men commonly are."
"而楼上，那一晚剩下的时光在轻快的氛围中度过了，因为大夫的兴致很高。不管一开始哈里·梅莱如何感到疲乏而心事重重，他终于经受不住那位高尚的先生，在各种各样的俏皮话、行医的趣闻轶事，和一大堆小笑话中所表现的幽默。而那些谈话，在奥利弗听来更是他闻所未闻的、世上最滑稽的笑话，他一阵阵地开怀大笑。这显然使医生感到十分满意，他自己也常常笑得前仰后合。在他的影响下，哈里也几乎是开开心心地笑起来了。所以，他们的聚会，可以说是当时那种情况下的最开心的聚会了。直到很晚，他们才带着轻快和感恩的心情散去，各自回房休息了，在刚刚经历了一段充满疑虑和悬疑的磨难之后，这正是他们迫切需要的。","Above stairs, the remainder of the evening passed cheerfully away; for the doctor was in high spirits;and however fatigued or thoughtful Harry Maylie might have been at first, he was not proof against the worthy gentleman’s good humour, which displayed itself in a great variety of sallies and professional recollections, and an abundance of small jokes, which struck Oliver as being the drollest things he had ever heard, and caused him to laugh proportionately;to the evident satisfaction of the doctor, who laughed immoderately at himself, and made Harry laugh almost as heartily, by the very force of sympathy.So, they were as pleasant a party as, under the circumstances, they could well have been; and it was late before they retired, with light and thankful hearts, to take that rest of which, after the doubt and suspense they had recently undergone, they stood much in need."
"奥利弗第二天早晨起床时心情好多了。他带着多日来不曾有过的希望和快乐，去做他每天一早必做的事情。鸟笼又被挂出去了，鸟儿们还是在同一个地方唱歌。他采来能找到的最甜美的野花，想再次用鲜花的美丽让罗丝开心。过去几天里，这个焦急的孩子无论看到什么美丽的东西，眼里都满是悲愁，现在这种悲愁已经神奇地被驱散开来。绿叶上的露珠似乎显得愈加闪闪发亮了；空气中树叶迎风沙沙作响的声音似乎变得更动听了；天空也比从前更加湛蓝、更加明亮了。这就是我们内心的想法对外物产生的影响，这种影响甚至施加在外物的形态上。人们观察自然和自己的同胞，大呼到处是黑暗和阴郁，这没有错。但那阴郁的色彩就是他们带有偏见的目光和心境的反映。真正的色彩是十分柔和的，需要更加明亮的目光。","Oliver rose next morning, in better heart, and went about his usual occupations, with more hope and pleasure than he had known for many days.The birds were once more hung out, to sing, in their old places; and the sweetest wild flowers that could be found, were once more gathered to gladden Rose with their beauty.The melancholy which had seemed to the sad eyes of the anxious boy to hang, for days past, over every object, beautiful as all were, was dispelled by magic.The dew seemed to sparkle more brightly on the green leaves; the air to rustle among them with a sweeter music; and the sky itself to look more blue and bright.Such is the influence which the condition of our own thoughts, exercise, even over the appearance of external objects.Men who look on nature, and their fellow-men, and cry that all is dark and gloomy, are in the right; but the sombre colours are reflections from their own jaundiced eyes and hearts.The real hues are delicate, and need a clearer vision."
"值得注意的是，奥利弗当时就发现了，清晨的采花之行已经不是他一个人在独自进行了。哈里·梅莱从第一天早上看到奥利弗抱着野花回家起，便忽然对鲜花充满了热情，并且在插花艺术方面表现出了不错的鉴赏力，把他年轻的同伴远远地抛在了后面。尽管奥利弗在这些方面落后了，但他知道在哪里可以采到最美丽的花。于是，一个早晨又一个早晨，他们一起，踏遍了乡野，把最美丽的盛开的鲜花带回家。罗丝小姐病房里的窗户现在都敞开着，因为她喜欢让夏天浓郁的气息流进屋里来，让新鲜的空气帮助自己恢复健康。就在那个格子窗户里，每天早晨，总有一小束很特别的且是经过精心修剪的花，插在那里，上面还沾着露珠。奥利弗不由地注意到，尽管插在小花瓶的花会按时更新，但那些枯萎了的花草从未被扔掉。他无意中还发现，每天早晨，医生来到花园的时候，总是雷打不动地朝那个特别的角落望去，再意味深长地地点点头，然后才开始散步。在这些观察中，日子飞快地过去了，罗丝也迅速康复了。","It is worthy of remark, and Oliver did not fail to note it at the time, that his morning expeditions were no longer made alone.Harry Maylie, after the very first morning when he met Oliver coming laden home, was seized with such a passion for flowers, and displayed such a taste in their arrangement, as left his young companion far behind.If Oliver were behindhand in these respects, he knew where the best were to be found; and morning after morning they scoured the country together, and brought home the fairest that blossomed.The window of the young lady’s chamber was opened now; for she loved to feel the rich summer air stream in, and revive her with its freshness; but there always stood in water, just inside the lattice, one particular little bunch, which was made up with great care, every morning.Oliver could not help noticing that the withered flowers were never thrown away, although the little vase was regularly replenished; nor, could he help observing, that whenever the doctor came into the garden, he invariably cast his eyes up to that particular corner, and nodded his head most expressively, as he set forth on his morning’s walk.Pending these observations, the days were flying by; and Rose was rapidly recovering."
"尽管年轻小姐还没有离开病房，除了偶尔和梅莱太太稍微走几步外，晚上不再出去散步，但奥利弗并没有感到时间有多难熬。他加倍努力，向那位白发老者学习。经过刻苦努力，他很快就取得了进步，这甚至让他自己也吃了一惊。就在他埋头苦学的时候，却发生了一件让他又是害怕又是苦恼的事情，这是他万万料想不到的。","Nor did Oliver’s time hang heavy on his hands, although the young lady had not yet left her chamber, and there were no evening walks, save now and then, for a short distance, with Mrs. Maylie.He applied himself, with redoubled assiduity, to the instructions of the white-headed old gentleman, and laboured so hard that his quick progress surprised even himself.It was while he was engaged in this pursuit, that he was greatly startled and distressed by a most unexpected occurrence."
"他每天刻苦读书的小屋子，位于房子后面的底楼。这是一间非常典型的农舍，房屋窗子上装有格子架，一簇簇茉莉和忍冬爬满了窗格，到处弥漫着沁人的香气。窗户正对着花园，那里有一扇侧门通向一片小围场，再过去就是茂盛的草地和树林了。那个方向再没有别的房舍了，前面十分空旷，视野很开阔。","The little room in which he was accustomed to sit, when busy at his books, was on the ground-floor, at the back of the house.It was quite a cottage-room, with a lattice-window: around which were clusters of jessamine and honeysuckle, that crept over the casement, and filled the place with their delicious perfume.It looked into a garden, whence a wicket-gate opened into a small paddock; all beyond, was fine meadow-land and wood.There was no other dwelling near, in that direction; and the prospect it commanded was very extensive."
"一个迷人的黄昏，夜色开始把第一片阴影洒向大地，奥利弗坐在这扇窗户旁，专心地看书。他已经看了一会儿了，由于那天天气特别闷热，他又十分用功，他就慢慢地、一点点地睡着了。无论作者是什么样的人，我们这样说，毫不败坏他的名声。","One beautiful evening, when the first shades of twilight were beginning to settle upon the earth, Oliver sat at this window, intent upon his books.He had been poring over them for some time; and, as the day had been uncommonly sultry, and he had exerted himself a great deal, it is no disparagement to the authors, whoever they may have been, to say, that gradually and by slow degrees, he fell asleep."
"有时候，有一种睡意会向我们偷偷袭来，在它控制住我们身体的时候，却没有让我们的心灵失去感知周围的能力，我们的心灵仍可以自由地奔驰。如果说一种难以承受的沉重感，一种力量上的虚弱无力，以及一种无法控制我们的思想或行为的状态，可以被称作睡眠，那么这就是了。然而，此时，我们对于在我们周围进行的一切活动仍有知觉。而且如果在这个时候我们做起梦来，任何真正说出来的话或发出的声音，便会以极快的速度融入我们的幻觉，以致想象和现实是如此离奇地融合在一起，事后要想将二者分清楚，几乎是不可能的了。这还不是最令人震惊的现象。一个不容怀疑的事实是，在这时虽然我们的触觉和视觉已经失去效用，但我们却会因某种外在事物无声的存在而受到影响；这甚至真实地影响我们睡眠中的意识，影响我们对眼前发生事情的视觉感受。在我们闭上眼睛时，它可能并非触手可及，而我们也不曾清醒地意识到它近在身边的存在。","There is a kind of sleep that steals upon us sometimes, which, while it holds the body prisoner, does not free the mind from a sense of things about it, and enable it to ramble at its pleasure.So far as an overpowering heaviness, a prostration of strength, and an utter inability to control our thoughts or power of motion, can be called sleep, this is it; and yet, we have a consciousness of all that is going on about us, and, if we dream at such a time, words which are really spoken, or sounds which really exists at the moment, accommodate themselves with surprising readiness to our visions, until reality and imagination become so strangely blended that it is afterwards almost matter of impossibility to separate the two.Nor is this, the most striking phenomenon incidental to such a state.It is an undoubted fact, that although our senses of touch and sight be for the time dead, yet our sleeping thoughts, and the visionary scenes that pass before us, will be influenced and materially influenced, by the—mere silent presence—of some external object; which may not have been near us when we closed our eyes: and of whose vicinity we have had no waking consciousness."
"奥利弗非常清楚地知道，他是在自己的小房间里，他的书摆在他面前的书桌上。馥郁的气息从外面蔓延的植物中涌进来。但他却睡着了。突然间，眼前的景象完全变了，空气变得浑浊，令人窒息。他在想象中又一次惊恐地回到了犹太人的家。那个可怕的老头仍坐在他常呆的那个角落里，一边用手指着他，一边扭过头，和坐在他身边的另一个男人窃窃私语。","Oliver knew, perfectly well, that he was in his own little room; that his books were lying on the table before him; that the sweet air was stirring among the creeping plants outside.And yet he was asleep.Suddenly, the scene changed; the air became close and confined; and he thought, with a glow of terror, that he was in the Jew’s house again.There sat the hideous old man, in his accustomed corner, pointing at him, and whispering to another man, with his face averted, who sat beside him."
"“小点儿声，亲爱的！”他觉得似乎听到那个犹太人说话，“就是他，非常肯定。那走吧。”","“Hush, my dear!” he thought he heard the Jew say; “it is he, sure enough.Come away.”"
"“就是他！”另一个男人似乎在回答，“你认为我还能把他给认错？即使有一群鬼魂全都变成他的样子，让他和他们站在一起，我还是能根据某些特点把他给认出来。即使你把他深埋在地下五十英尺的地方，让我在他的坟墓上走过，我也能指出他埋在哪里，就算地面上没有任何标志。”","“He!” the other man seemed to answer; “could I mistake him, think you?If a crowd of ghosts were to put themselves into his exact shape, and he stood amongst them, there is something that would tell me how to point him out.If you buried him fifty feet deep, and took me across his grave, I fancy I should know, if there wasn’t a mark above it, that he lay buried there?”"
"那人仿佛带着血海深仇似的说出这些话，奥利弗被吓醒了，突然站起身来。","The man seemed to say this, with such dreadful hatred, that Oliver awoke with the fear, and started up."
"天哪！那是什么，他突然觉得血涌心头，说不出话来，一动也不动！那边——那边——在窗口——离他很近——那么近，要不是他惊吓得退了几步，他几乎都可以摸到那个人——站在那里的那个犹太人。他正睁着眼睛向屋里张望，和奥利弗的眼神相遇了。站在他旁边的，正是那天在客栈庭院里碰见的那个人，他的脸由于恐惧或愤怒，或者二者都有，变得煞白。","Good Heaven! what was that, which sent the blood tingling to his heart, and deprived him of his voice, and of power to move!There—there—at the window—close before him—so close, that he could have almost touched him before he started back: with his eyes peering into the room, and meeting his: there stood the Jew!And beside him, white with rage or fear, or both, were the scowling features of the man who had accosted him in the inn-yard."
"这一切转瞬即逝，在他眼前一闪而过，他们都不见了。不过他们认出了他，奥利弗也认出了他们。他们的相貌仿佛从他一出生就出现在他的面前，像刻在石头上一样，深深地印入他的记忆里。他站在那里好一会儿不能动弹，然后他从窗口跳进花园里，大声呼救。","It was but an instant, a glance, a flash, before his eyes; and they were gone.But they had recognised him, and he them; and their look was as firmly impressed upon his memory, as if it had been deeply carved in stone, and set before him from his birth.He stood transfixed for a moment; then, leaping from the window into the garden, called loudly for help."
"第三十五章 奥利弗的奇遇结果令人不太满意；哈里·梅莱和罗丝之间一次比较重要的谈话","CHAPTER XXXV Containing the unsatisfactory result of Oliver’s adventure; and a conversation of some importance between Harry Maylie and Rose "
"屋子里的人听到奥利弗的叫声，急忙赶到事发现场，发现奥利弗脸色苍白、神情激动。他手指着屋子后面那片草地的方向，话都说不清楚了，只是叫着“老犹太人！老犹太人！”","When the inmates of the house, attracted by Oliver’s cries, hurried to the spot from which they proceeded, they found him, pale and agitated, pointing in the direction of the meadows behind the house, and scarcely able to articulate the words, “The Jew! the Jew!”"
"贾尔斯先生弄不懂这喊叫是什么意思，一时不知所措；哈里·梅莱的反应要快些，他从母亲那里听说过奥利弗的身世，因此立刻就明白了。","Mr. Giles was at a loss to comprehend what this outcry meant; but Harry Maylie, whose perceptions were something quicker, and who had heard Oliver’s history from his mother, understood it at once."
"“他朝哪个方向跑了？”他问道，抓起一根立在角落里的沉甸甸的棍子。","“What direction did he take?” he asked, catching up a heavy stick which was standing in a corner."
"“那边。”奥利弗回答道，手指着那人逃走的方向，“一转眼就不见人影了。”","“That,” replied Oliver, pointing out the course the man had taken; “I missed them in an instant.”"
"“那么，他们一定是躲到沟里了！”哈里说，“追！尽可能跟着我。”他这么说着，纵身一跃，翻过篱笆，冲了出去，速度快得让其他人很难跟得上。","“Then, they are in the ditch!” said Harry.“Follow!And keep as near me, as you can.”So saying, he sprang over the hedge, and darted off with a speed which rendered it matter of exceeding difficulty for the others to keep near him."
"贾尔斯尽量跟上，奥利弗也紧随其后；不出一两分钟，外出散步刚刚回来的罗斯伯力先生也跟在他们后面，跌跌跘跘地翻过篱笆，然后一骨碌站起身来，身手敏捷得超乎想象。他也朝着那个方向跑去，速度不容小觑。他一边跑一边放开嗓门高声叫着，想要弄清楚发生了什么事。","Giles followed as well as he could; and Oliver followed too; and in the course of a minute or two, Mr. Losberne, who had been out walking, and just then returned, tumbled over the hedge after them, and picking himself up with more agility than he could have been supposed to possess, struck into the same course at no contemptible speed, shouting all the while, most prodigiously, to know what was the matter."
"他们继续追着，谁都不曾停下来喘口气。直到领头的那位冲到奥利弗所指的那片田野的一角，开始仔细搜查水沟和附近的篱笆，这才让后面的人有时间赶了上来；奥利弗也抓住机会，向罗斯伯力先生讲明引起这场奋力追击的原因。","On they all went; nor stopped they once to breathe, until the leader, striking off into an angle of the field indicated by Oliver, began to search, narrowly, the ditch and hedge adjoining; which afforded time for the remainder of the party to come up; and for Oliver to communicate to Mr. Losberne the circumstances that had led to so vigorous a pursuit."
"搜查徒劳无功。甚至连新近留下的脚印痕迹都没有看到。他们现在站在一座小山丘顶上，周围三四里的开阔地形都能尽收眼底。村子坐落在左边的小山谷里，但是，在顺着奥利弗所指的方向一路追击之后，再想要到达村子，他们必须要在开阔的地面上兜个圈子，这是在那么短的时间内不可能做到的。另一边是一片茂密的树林，位于草地的边缘，但是由于同样的原因，他们也无法到达那里。","The search was all in vain.There were not even the traces of recent footsteps, to be seen.They stood now, on the summit of a little hill, commanding the open fields in every direction for three or four miles.There was the village in the hollow on the left; but, in order to gain that, after pursuing the track Oliver had pointed out, the men must have made a circuit of open ground, which it was impossible they could have accomplished in so short a time.A thick wood skirted the meadow-land in another direction; but they could not have gained that covert for the same reason."
"“这肯定是你的幻想，奥利弗。”哈里·梅莱说。","“It must have been a dream, Oliver,” said Harry Maylie."
"“哦，不，是真的，先生。”奥利弗回答，他一想起那个老无赖的脸就不禁哆嗦。“我清清楚楚地看到他了。我看到他们两个人了，清楚得就像我现在看着你一样。”","“Oh no, indeed, sir,” replied Oliver, shuddering at the very recollection of the old wretch’s countenance; “I saw him too plainly for that.I saw them both, as plainly as I see you now.”"
"“另一个人是谁？”哈里和罗斯伯力先生一起问道。","“Who was the other?” inquired Harry and Mr. Losberne, together."
"“就是我告诉你的那个人，在客栈里撞上我的那个人。”奥利弗说，“当时我们俩都瞪大了眼睛看着对方，我敢发誓一定是他。”","“The very same man I told you of, who came so suddenly upon me at the inn,” said Oliver.“We had our eyes fixed full upon each other; and I could swear to him.”"
"“他们是朝这个方向跑了吗？”哈里问道，“你确定吗？”","“They took this way?” demanded Harry: “are you sure?”"
"“没错，那个人刚才就在窗户那里。”奥利弗回答，并且手朝下，指着将花园和草地隔开的篱笆。“那个高个子跳了过来，就从那里；然后那犹太人往右边跑了几步，从空隙里爬了出来。”","“As I am that the men were at the window,” replied Oliver, pointing down, as he spoke, to the hedge which divided the cottage-garden from the meadow.“The tall man leaped over, just there; and the Jew, running a few paces to the right, crept through that gap.”"
"两位先生看着奥利弗说话时一脸的真诚，又相互对望了一眼，似乎相信他说得很准确。然而，四处都看不见因为有人慌张逃跑而踩过的痕迹。草长得很高，但是除了他们自己踩倒的之外，再没有任何践踏的痕迹了。水沟两边和边缘的泥土都是湿湿的，但是他们并没发现人的脚印，也找不到任何证据可以表明在过去的几小时内有人从上面走过。","The two gentlemen watched Oliver’s earnest face, as he spoke, and looking from him to each other, seemed to feel satisfied of the accuracy of what he said.Still, in no direction were there any appearances of the trampling of men in hurried flight.The grass was long; but it was trodden down nowhere, save where their own feet had crushed it.The sides and brinks of the ditches were of damp clay; but in no one place could they discern the print of men’s shoes, or the slightest mark which would indicate that any feet had pressed the ground for hours before."
"“这可奇怪了！”哈里说。","“This is strange!” said Harry."
"“奇怪？”医生附和道，“就是布拉泽斯和达夫他们自己也搞不出什么名堂来。”","“Strange?” echoed the doctor.“Blathers and Duff, themselves, could make nothing of it.”"
"尽管搜查已经明显是徒劳一场，但是直到夜色降临，无法再进一步取证时，他们才停手。即使是这样，他们也是十分不情愿地停下来的。关于这两个陌生人的模样与衣着打扮，依据奥利弗能够给出的最详细的描述，大家派贾尔斯去村子里各个酒吧看看，找找这两个人。若是有人曾看见这两个人在附近喝酒闲逛的话，老犹太人是无论如何叫人忘不了的。但是贾尔斯却空手而归，没能搜集到任何能够解开谜团或至少能提供一丝线索的消息。","Notwithstanding the evidently useless nature of their search, they did not desist until the coming on of night rendered its further prosecution hopeless; and even then, they gave it up with reluctance.Giles was dispatched to the different ale-houses in the village, furnished with the best description Oliver could give of the appearance and dress of the strangers.Of these, the Jew was, at all events, sufficiently remarkable to be remembered, supposing he had been seen drinking, or loitering about; but Giles returned without any intelligence, calculated to dispel or lessen the mystery."
"次日，大家又进行了一次搜查，继续打听消息，但仍旧是一无所获。第三天，奥利弗和梅莱先生赶往镇上，希望能从那里看到或打听到什么消息。可是这番努力同样没有结果。几天以后，人们渐渐忘记了这回事。正如大多数事情那样，如果没有新鲜的消息加以补充，再令人惊奇的事情也会消逝不见了。","On the next day, fresh search was made, and the inquiries renewed; but with no better success.On the day following, Oliver and Mr. Maylie repaired to the market-town, in the hope of seeing or hearing something of the men there; but this effort was equally fruitless.After a few days, the affair began to be forgotten, as most affairs are, when wonder, having no fresh food to support it, dies away of itself."
"在此期间，罗丝恢复得很快。她已经能够离开房间，自己外出了。她再一次与家人团聚，欢乐被带到每一个人的心里。","Meanwhile, Rose was rapidly recovering.She had left her room: was able to go out; and mixing once more with the family, carried joy into the hearts of all."
"尽管这样的变化令人开心，也给这个小圈子带来了显而易见的影响；尽管欢乐的声音和愉快的笑声又一次回响在村舍里，然而有时候，有些人，甚至包括罗丝本人，却表现出一种异常的拘谨，奥利弗不由地察觉到了这一点。梅莱太太和她的儿子时常在房间里密谈很久；罗丝也不止一次脸上挂着泪痕，出现在大家面前。在罗斯伯力先生确定了他要离开这里，前往彻特西的日子之后，这样的迹象更多了；很显然，一些事情正在发生，而且影响到了这位年轻女士和其他一些人平静的心绪。","But, although this happy change had a visible effect on the little circle; and although cheerful voices and merry laughter were once more heard in the cottage; there was at times, an unwonted restraint upon some there: even upon Rose herself: which Oliver could not fail to remark.Mrs. Maylie and her son were often closeted together for a long time; and more than once Rose appeared with traces of tears upon her face.After Mr. Losberne had fixed a day for his departure to Chertsey, these symptoms increased; and it became evident that something was in progress which affected the peace of the young lady, and of somebody else besides."
"最终，一天早晨，当罗丝一个人坐在吃早餐的客厅时，哈里·梅莱进来了。他略略犹豫了一下，问她是否能够和他说会儿话。","At length, one morning, when Rose was alone in the breakfast-parlour, Harry Maylie entered; and, with some hesitation, begged permission to speak with her for a few moments."
"“一会儿——就一小会儿——就够了，罗丝。”年轻人说道，把椅子拉向她。“我想要说什么，你心里其实明白的；而我最珍爱的期待你并不是不知道，尽管你还没有听我亲口说出。”","“A few—a very few—will suffice, Rose,” said the young man, drawing his chair towards her.“What I shall have to say, has already presented itself to your mind; the most cherished hopes of my heart are not unknown to you, though from my lips you have not heard them stated.”"
"自从他走进来那一刻起，罗丝的脸色就十分苍白，不过这也许是她近来一直生病的缘故。她微微欠了欠身，朝身旁的几盆植物俯下身去，安静地等着他接着说下去。","Rose had been very pale from the moment of his entrance; but that might have been the effect of her recent illness.She merely bowed; and bending over some plants that stood near, waited in silence for him to proceed."
"“我——我——也许早该离开这里了。”哈里说。","“I—I—ought to have left here, before,” said Harry."
"“没错，你本该早点儿离开的。”罗丝回答，“原谅我这么说，但是我希望你离开。”","“You should, indeed,” replied Rose.“Forgive me for saying so, but I wish you had.”"
"“我来到这里，是缘于一种最可怕、最痛苦的担忧，”年轻人说，“那是一种害怕失去意中人的担忧，我把种种希望和期盼都寄托在她身上。你差点儿死去，一直在凡间与天国之间徘徊。我们都明白，每当年轻的、美丽的，而且善良的人们为病痛所折磨，他们纯净的灵魂总会于无形中前往他们那光明、永恒的安息之所；上帝保佑我们！在我们当中，那些最美丽也最善良的人往往在风华正茂时就离开了。”","“I was brought here, by the most dreadful and agonising of all apprehensions,” said the young man; “the fear of losing the one dear being on whom my every wish and hope are fixed.You had been dying; trembling between earth and heaven.We know that when the young, the beautiful, and good, are visited with sickness, their pure spirits insensibly turn towards their bright home of lasting rest; we know, Heaven help us! that the best and fairest of our kind, too often fade in blooming.”"
"听到这些话，温柔的姑娘眼中不觉泛出泪光；一颗泪珠落在她身下的花朵上，在花冠上晶莹闪亮，花朵也因此显得更加娇美；从她那年轻纯净的心中流露出来的这种感情，仿佛能够理所当然地与世间最美好的事物相媲美。","There were tears in the eyes of the gentle girl, as these words were spoken; and when one fell upon the flower over which she bent, and glistened brightly in its cup, making it more beautiful, it seemed as though the outpouring of her fresh young heart, claimed kindred naturally, with the loveliest things in nature."
"“上帝的一个创造物，”年轻人激动地继续说道，“像上帝身旁的天使一样美丽动人、天真无邪的创造物，却在生死之间游移不定。哦！当那个她所熟悉的遥远的世界，已在她眼前展开了一半，谁又能期盼她还会回到这个充满悲伤、灾难重重的世界呢！罗丝，罗丝，当我想到你正如上天投射在尘世间的某种柔和的光影一般隐去，我就不再抱有希望，不再幻想你能够再回到那些流连世间的人们中间，我也不知道什么应该是你回来的理由；我感觉，你是属于那光明之所的，那是许多美丽善良之人已展翅前往的地方；然而，在这些自我安慰的幻想里，我仍祈祷你能够回到那些爱你的人身边——这些念头太沉重了，令我几乎承受不起。我整日整夜地这样想着，伴随而来的还有汹涌湍流一般的担忧、恐惧，以及自私的悔恨，如果你死了，就将永远无法得知我是如此深刻地爱着你；这股激流几乎一路摧毁了我的直觉和理智。然而你竟好转了。每一日，甚至每一小时，健康如水滴般一点点涌入你的身体，汇入那已经筋疲力尽、无力流淌的生命之流，使其再次成为汹涌澎湃的浪潮。我看着你死而复生，双眼因为热切的渴望和深切的爱意而几乎盲目。不要告诉我，你希望我放弃这份热情，因为它已经使我的心里满是对人类的柔情。”","“A creature,” continued the young man, passionately, “a creature as fair and innocent of guile as one of God’s own angels, fluttered between life and death.Oh! who could hope, when the distant world to which she was akin, half opened to her view, that she would return to the sorrow and calamity of this!Rose, Rose, to know that you were passing away like some soft shadow, which a light from above, casts upon the earth; to have no hope that you would be spared to those who linger here; hardly to know a reason why you should be;to feel that you belonged to that bright sphere whither so many of the fairest and the best have winged their early flight; and yet to pray, amid all these consolations, that you might be restored to those who loved you—these were distractions almost too great to bear.They were mine, by day and night; and with them, came such a rushing torrent of fears, and apprehensions, and selfish regrets, lest you should die, and never know how devotedly I loved you, as almost bore down sense and reason in its course.You recovered.Day by day, and almost hour by hour, some drop of health came back, and mingling with the spent and feeble stream of life which circulated languidly within you, swelled it again to a high and rushing tide.I have watched you change almost from death, to life, with eyes that turned blind with their eagerness and deep affection.Do not tell me that you wish I had lost this; for it has softened my heart to all mankind.”"
"“我不是那个意思。”罗丝抹着眼泪说道，“我只是希望你离开这儿，这样你就可以重新追求高贵的事业，追求那些值得你去追逐的事业。”","“I did not mean that,” said Rose, weeping; “I only wish you had left here, that you might have turned to high and noble pursuits again; to pursuits well worthy of you.”"
"“再没有什么事业，哪怕是世上最崇高的事业，会比赢得你的芳心更值得我去追逐。”年轻人拉起她的手说道，“罗丝，我亲爱的罗丝！这么多年——这么多年来，我一直爱着你；我希望功成名就，然后可以衣锦还乡，告诉你我所追逐的这一切都只是为了与你分享；白日梦中，我总是想着，在那个幸福的时刻，我该怎样让你知道我曾做出的那些沉默的姿态实则是孩子般的对你的依恋。我要向你求婚，以此取代我们之间长久以来就存在的无声的默契！那个时刻还未到来；但是眼下，虽然我既无功名，年轻时的憧憬也还未实现，我却要向你献上我这一颗心，它早就是属于你的了；我将我的一切都寄托在你做出的回应之上。”","“There is no pursuit more worthy of me: more worthy of the highest nature that exists: than the struggle to win such a heart as yours,” said the young man, taking her hand.“Rose, my own dear Rose!For years—for years—I have loved you; hoping to win my way to fame, and then come proudly home and tell you it had been pursued only for you to share;thinking, in my daydreams, how I would remind you, in that happy moment, of the many silent tokens I had given of a boy’s attachment, and claim your hand, as in redemption of some old mute contract that had been sealed between us!That time has not arrived; but here, with not fame won, and no young vision realised, I offer you the heart so long your own, and stake my all upon the words with which you greet the offer.”"
"“一直以来，你品行良好，道德高尚。”罗丝说，努力抑制着自己激动的情绪。","“Your behaviour has ever been kind and noble.” said Rose, mastering the emotions by which she was agitated."
"“既然你相信我并非冷漠无情，亦非忘恩负义之人，那么请听听我的回答吧。”","“As you believe that I am not insensible or ungrateful, so hear my answer.”"
"“回答就是，我能够努力使自己配得上你；就是这回答，是不是，亲爱的罗丝？”","“It is, that I may endeavour to deserve you; it is, dear Rose?”"
"“我的回答是，”罗丝答道，“你必须努力忘掉我，不是要你忘掉我曾是你长久以来亲密的伙伴，那样会让我很伤心，而是要你忘掉我是你爱上的人。世界之大，想想有那么多女孩，你都会因为赢取了她们的芳心而骄傲的。若你收获了另外一份爱情，可以向我倾吐，我定会成为你最真挚、最贴心，也是最忠诚的朋友。”","“It is,” replied Rose, “that you must endeavour to forget me; not as your old and dearly-attached companion, for that would wound me deeply; but, as the object of your love.Look into the world; think how many hearts you would be proud to gain, are there.Confide some other passion to me, if you will; I will be the truest, warmest, and most faithful friend you have.”"
"接着就是一阵沉默。罗丝用一只手遮着脸，泪如泉涌。哈里仍握着她的另外一只手。","There was a pause, during which, Rose, who had covered her face with one hand, gave free vent to her tears.Harry still retained the other."
"“罗丝，”终于，他用低沉的声音说道，“告诉我你的理由，你做出这个决定的理由！”","“And your reasons, Rose,” he said, at length, in a low voice; “your reasons for this decision?”"
"“你有权知道理由。”罗丝回答说，“但是，无论你再说什么也改变不了我的心意。这是我必须承担的责任。这是我对别人，也是对我自己的责任。”","“You have a right to know them,” rejoined Rose.“You can say nothing to alter my resolution.It is a duty that I must perform.I owe it, alike to others, and to myself.”"
"“对你自己？”","“To yourself?”"
"“是的，哈里。这是对我自己的责任，我这个既无朋友也没财产的女孩，名声也并非完全清清白白，不应该让你的朋友有理由怀疑我是因为居心不良，才接受你的第一次动心，成为你梦想成真以及计划实施的阻碍。这也是我对你以及你的亲人的责任，让你不会因慷慨天性中的热情，而在前进的道路上遇上这样巨大的障碍。”","“Yes, Harry.I owe it to myself, that I, a friendless, portionless, girl, with a blight upon my name, should not give your friends reason to suspect that I had sordidly yielded to your first passion, and fastened myself, a clog, on all your hopes and projects.I owe it to you and yours, to prevent you from opposing, in the warmth of your generous nature, this great obstacle to your progress in the world.”"
"“如果你的意愿与你的责任感是一致的话——”哈里开始说道。","“If your inclinations chime with your sense of duty—” Harry began."
"“它们不一致。”罗丝脸涨得通红，回答道。","“They do not,” replied Rose, colouring deeply."
"“那么，你会回应我的爱吗？”哈里问，“请答应了吧，亲爱的罗丝；请这么答应吧，好让这沉重的失望给我带来的苦楚得以舒缓！”","“Then you return my love?” said Harry.“Say but that, dear Rose; say but that; and soften the bitterness of this hard disappointment!”"
"“如果我可以这么做，而又不会对我爱的人造成伤害的话，”罗丝回答，“我本可以——”“会以迥然不同的心情接受我的请求？”哈里说，“至少，不要对我隐瞒，罗丝。”","“If I could have done so, without doing heavy wrong to him I loved,” rejoined Rose, “I could have—” “Have received this declaration very differently?” said Harry.“Do not conceal that from me, at least, Rose.”"
"“我可以。”罗丝说，“打住！”她补充道，抽出手来，“为什么我们还要继续这令人痛苦的谈话？对我来说实在很痛苦，尽管它能够带来长久的幸福感；知道你曾经像现在这样看重我，这让我觉得幸福，而你在人生中取得的每一个胜利也将激励我更加刚强，更加坚定。再见，哈里！我们今日这样的见面，以后再不会有了；但是，只要我们不是像今天这场谈话中所处的关系，我们彼此间仍旧能够以别的身份，维持长久美好的情谊；愿一切怀有真心和诚挚感情的祈祷者为你祝福，从那源头降下的所有真理和真情，使你快乐，能得成就！”","“I could,” said Rose.“Stay!” she added, disengaging her hand, “why should we prolong this painful interview?Most painful to me, and yet productive of lasting happiness, notwithstanding; for it will be happiness to know that I once held the high place in your regard which I now occupy, and every triumph you achieve in life will animate me with new fortitude and firmness.Farewell, Harry!As we have met to-day, we meet no more; but in other relations than those in which this conversation have placed us, we may be long and happily entwined; and may every blessing that the prayers of a true and earnest heart can call down from the source of all truth and sincerity, cheer and prosper you!”"
"“再听我说一句，罗丝。”哈里说，“用你自己的话讲讲道理。让我听听从你嘴里说出的道理！”","“Another word, Rose,” said Harry.“Your reason in your own words.From your own lips, let me hear it!”"
"罗丝坚定地回答道：“你前程似锦。你才华横溢，又有些有势力的亲友，在社会上都能够帮助你，一切荣耀都在等着你。但是你这些亲友都很骄傲，而我既不会与这些嘲笑我亲生母亲的人来往，也不会给那位在我心里，取代了我母亲位置的人的儿子带来耻辱和挫败。总之，”姑娘说，她那坚定的态度已有所动摇，于是转过身去，“我的名声已沾上了污点，世人却要因此殃及清白之人。一切我都会自己承担，绝不会使别人蒙受不白之冤；让惩罚只降临在我头上吧。”","“The prospect before you,” answered Rose, firmly, “is a brilliant one.All the honours to which great talents and powerful connections can help men in public life, are in store for you.But those connections are proud; and I will neither mingle with such as may hold in scorn the mother who gave me life; nor bring disgrace or failure on the son of her who has so well supplied that mother’s place.In a word,” said the young lady, turning away, as her temporary firmness forsook her, “there is a stain upon my name, which the world visits on innocent heads.I will carry it into no blood but my own; and the reproach shall rest alone on me.”"
"“再听我一句，罗丝。最亲爱的罗丝！就一句！”哈里叫道，冲到她身前。“如果我并不是这么——这么富贵，如世人所说——如果我命中注定要过的是一种平淡而安静的生活——如果我出生贫苦，多病而无助——那么你还会拒我于千里之外吗？还是因为我将来有可能享有富贵和荣誉，所以你才计较我的出身？”","“One word more, Rose.Dearest Rose! one more!” cried Harry, throwing himself before her.“If I had been less—less fortunate, the world would call it—if some obscure and peaceful life had been my destiny—if I had been poor, sick, helpless—would you have turned from me then?Or has my probable advancement to riches and honour, given this scruple birth?”"
"“别逼我回答。”罗丝答道，“不存在这个问题，永不。提出这样的问题是不公平的，甚至并非出于善意。”","“Do not press me to reply,” answered Rose.“The question does not arise, and never will.It is unfair, almost unkind, to urge it.”"
"“如果你的回答正是我几乎所奢求的那样，”哈里反驳道，“这就在我孤独的路途上洒下一丝幸福的微光，照亮我前行的路。你简单的几句话，对于一个爱你甚过一切的人来说，却是多么重要。哦，罗丝，看在我对你热切持久的爱意份上，看在我因你要承受的折磨，以及你使我注定要经受的一切痛苦的份上，回答我这个问题吧！”","“If your answer be what I almost dare to hope it is,” retorted Harry, “it will shed a gleam of happiness upon my lonely way, and light the path before me.It is not an idle thing to do so much, by the utterance of a few brief words, for one who loves you beyond all else.Oh, Rose: in the name of my ardent and enduring attachment; in the name of all I have suffered for you, and all you doom me to undergo; answer me this one question!”"
"“那么，如果你的命运是另一种安排，”罗丝回答道，“如果你的出身只是比我略微高贵一些，而不是相距甚远；如果，在安静幽居的卑微生活中，我能够给予你帮助和安慰，而不是在那充满抱负的杰出人群中成为你的一个污点，一种障碍，我也无需遭受这种折磨。我现在完全有理由感到幸福，极度的幸福；但是，哈里，我承认我本应该拥有更大的幸福。”","“Then, if your lot had been differently cast,” rejoined Rose; “if you had been even a little, but not so far, above me; if I could have been a help and comfort to you in any humble scene of peace and retirement, and not a blot and drawback in ambitious and distinguished crowds; I should have been spared this trial.I have every reason to be happy, very happy, now; but then, Harry, I own I should have been happier.”"
"罗丝一边这样倾诉着，一边不禁回想起往事，想起当她还是个小女孩时就珍藏在心里的愿望，此刻一起涌上心头，但那已经是枯萎的旧日期望，罗丝流下眼泪，这也使她得到宽慰。","Busy recollections of old hopes, cherished as a girl, long ago, crowded into the mind of Rose, while making this avowal; but they brought tears with them, as old hopes will when they come back withered; and they relieved her."
"“我无法改变这种软弱，而它也使我的决心更加坚定。”罗丝伸出手来，说道，“如今，我必须要离开你了。”","“I cannot help this weakness, and it makes my purpose stronger,” said Rose, extending her hand.“I must leave you now, indeed.”"
"“我请求你答应一件事情。”哈里说，“一次，只是再一次——比如说一年之内，也许会更早——我能够再跟你谈一次这件事，最后一次。”","“I ask one promise,” said Harry.“Once, and only once more,—say within a year, but it may be much sooner,—I may speak to you again on this subject, for the last time.”"
"“不要逼我改变正确的决定。”罗丝回答，忧郁地笑了笑，“没有用的。”","“Not to press me to alter my right determination,” replied Rose, with a melancholy smile; “it will be useless.”"
"“不。”哈里说，“我要再听你说一次，如果你愿意——最后再同我说一次！无论我拥有什么地位财富，我都会把它们放在你脚下；如果到那时你还坚持你现在的决定，我也不会试图用言语或行动来改变它。”","“No,” said Harry; “to hear you repeat it, if you will—finally repeat it!I will lay at your feet, whatever of station of fortune I may possess; and if you still adhere to your present resolution, will not seek, by word or act, to change it.”"
"“那么就这样吧。”罗丝说，“那只会再增添一次痛苦，不过，到了那时，也许我就能够承受得住了。”","“Then let it be so,” rejoined Rose; “it is but one pang the more, and by that time I may be enabled to bear it better.”"
"她再一次伸出手。但是年轻人却拥抱了她，在她美丽的额头上留下一吻，然后匆匆离开了房间。","She extended her hand again.But the young man caught her to his bosom; and imprinting one kiss on her beautiful forehead, hurried from the room."
"第三十六章 本篇很短，看起来似乎不是特别重要，尽管如此，读者还是应将其当作上一章的延续来读，也应当把它看作是了解将来自会发生之事的关键","CHAPTER XXXVI Is a very short one, and may appear of no great importance in its place, but it should be read notwithstanding, as a sequel to the last, and a key to one that will follow when its time arrives "
"“那么，你决定今天早上做我的旅伴了，嗯？”看到哈里·梅莱坐到桌边，和自己与奥利弗一起享用早餐，医生这样问道，“哎，你后半个小时的心绪和意图跟前半个小时的都不一样！”","“And so you are resolved to be my travelling companion this morning; eh?” said the doctor, as Harry Maylie joined him and Oliver at the breakfast-table.“Why, you are not in the same mind or intention two half-hours together!”"
"“总有一天你会改变这个看法的。”哈里说着，无缘无故地红了脸。","“You will tell me a different tale one of these days,” said Harry, colouring without any perceptible reason."
"“我倒是希望我会。”罗斯伯力先生回答道，“虽然我得承认，我并不这么认为。昨天早上你才匆忙做出决定，要留在这里，像个孝顺的儿子一样陪着令堂到海边去。昨天中午前，你却宣布要去伦敦，赏脸顺道陪我走一程。到了晚上，你又神神秘秘地催我，要我在女士们起身之前动身；结果呢，奥利弗现在还得呆在这儿吃早饭，要不然他早该到草地上去搜寻各种各样的奇花异草了。这可太糟了，是不是，奥利弗？”","“I hope I may have good cause to do so,” replied Mr. Losberne; “though I confess I don’t think I shall.But yesterday morning you had made up your mind, in a great hurry, to stay here, and to accompany your mother, like a dutiful son, to the sea-side.Before noon, you announce that you are going to do me the honour of accompanying me as far as I go, on your road to London.And at night, you urge me, with great mystery, to start before the ladies are stirring; the consequence of which is, that young Oliver here is pinned down to his breakfast when he ought to be ranging the meadows after botanical phenomena of all kinds.Too bad, isn’t it, Oliver?”"
"“要是你和梅莱先生出发的时候，我却不在家的话，我会很难过的，先生。”奥利弗回答道。","“I should have been very sorry not to have been at home when you and Mr. Maylie went away, sir,” rejoined Oliver."
"“真是个好小子。”医生说，“你回来后可得来看我。不过，说正经的，哈里，你这么急着离开，是不是大人物那边传下什么话来了？”","“That’s a fine fellow,” said the doctor; “you shall come and see me when you return.But, to speak seriously, Harry; has any communication from the great nobs produced this sudden anxiety on your part to be gone?”"
"“我想，”哈里回答，“你所说的大人物包括我那位庄重体面的叔叔吧。自从我来到这里，他还从没和我联系过呢；而且，在一年的这个时候，好像也不会发生什么事情，需要我立刻赶到他们身边的。”","“The great nobs,” replied Harry, “under which designation, I presume, you include my most stately uncle, have not communicated with me at all, since I have been here; nor, at this time of the year, is it likely that anything would occur to render necessary my immediate attendance among them.”"
"“那么，”医生说，“你可真是个怪人。不过，在圣诞节前的选举中，他们肯定会把你弄进议会的吧，这套变来变去的作风对政治生活来说倒不失为不错的准备。这里准有些道理。不管是争夺地位、奖杯，还是赛马奖，良好的训练总是需要的。”","“Well,” said the doctor, “you are a queer fellow.But of course they will get you into parliament at the election before Christmas, and these sudden shiftings and changes are no bad preparation for political life.There’s something in that.Good training is always desirable, whether the race be for place, cup, or sweepstakes.”"
"哈里·梅莱看起来只需一两句话就能结束这段简短的对话，而且这两句话还能让医生大吃一惊；不过他只说了一句话“我们走着瞧”，就不再继续谈下去了。过了不久，驿车停在了门口；贾尔斯走进来取行李，好心的医生奔出门去，看着他们捆扎行李。","Harry Maylie looked as if he could have followed up this short dialogue by one or two remarks that would have staggered the doctor not a little; but he contented himself with saying, “We shall see,” and pursued the subject no farther.The post-chaise drove up to the door shortly afterwards; and Giles coming in for the luggage, the good doctor bustled out, to see it packed."
"“奥利弗，”哈里·梅莱低声说道说，“我跟你说句话。”","“Oliver,” said Harry Maylie, in a low voice, “let me speak a word with you.”"
"梅莱先生在窗台向奥利弗招手，奥利弗便走了过去；可是梅莱先生表现出一副悲痛与兴奋交织的神态，让奥利弗大吃一惊。","Oliver walked into the window-recess to which Mr. Maylie beckoned him; much surprised at the mixture of sadness and boisterous spirits, which his whole behaviour displayed."
"“你现在会写字了吧？”哈里抓着奥利弗的胳膊，问道。","“You can write well now?” said Harry, laying his hand upon his arm."
"“我想，差不多，先生。”奥利弗回答。","“I hope so, sir,” replied Oliver."
"“我又要离开家了，也许要过一段时间才能回来；我希望你给我写信——比如，两周一次，也就是隔一周一写一次，寄到伦敦邮政总局。可以吗？”","“I shall not be at home again, perhaps for some time; I wish you would write to me—say once a fort-night: every alternate Monday: to the General Post Office in London.Will you?”"
"“哦！当然可以，先生，我很荣幸能为您效劳。”奥利弗大声说，对于这一任务感到十分高兴。","“Oh! certainly, sir; I shall be proud to do it,” exclaimed Oliver, greatly delighted with the commission."
"“我想要知道——我的母亲和梅莱小姐过得怎么样，”年轻人说，“你可以写在一张纸上，告诉我，你们怎么散步的，说了什么话啊，她——我是说她们——看起来是不是很开心，很健康。你明白我的意思吗？”","“I should like to know how—how my mother and Miss Maylie are,” said the young man; “and you can fill up a sheet by telling me what walks you take, and what you talk about, and whether she—they, I mean—seem happy and quite well.You understand me?”"
"“哦！明白了，先生，非常明白。”奥利弗回答道。","“Oh! quite, sir, quite,” replied Oliver."
"“我希望你别跟她们说这回事。”哈里赶忙说，“因为这样会让我母亲很担心，给我写信写得就更勤了，这对她来说是件又麻烦又发愁的事。这件事就当成是我俩之间的秘密，别忘了告诉我每一件事！我就靠你了。”","“I would rather you did not mention it to them,” said Harry, hurrying over his words; “because it might make my mother anxious to write to me oftener, and it is a trouble and worry to her.Let it be a secret between you and me; and mind you tell me everything!I depend upon you.”"
"奥利弗意识到自己的重要性，觉得又得意又荣幸，信誓旦旦地保证一定会保守秘密，而且信也一定写得详细。梅莱先生向他告别，再三向他保证以后会关心他、保护他。","Oliver, quite elated and honoured by a sense of his importance, faithfully promised to be secret and explicit in his communications.Mr. Maylie took leave of him, with many assurances of his regard and protection."
"医生已坐上了马车；贾尔斯（已经安排他留下来）站在一旁，用手扶着打开的车门；几个女仆在花园里张望着。哈里朝格子窗轻轻一瞥，然后跳上马车。","The doctor was in the chaise; Giles (who, it had been arranged, should be left behind) held the door open in his hand; and the women-servants were in the garden, looking on.Harry cast one slight glance at the latticed window, and jumped into the carriage."
"“走！”他大叫一声，“加油，快跑，全力跑起来！今天，只有飞速前进才能配得上我的步伐。”","“Drive on!” he cried, “hard, fast, full gallop!Nothing short of flying will keep pace with me, to-day.”"
"“啊呀！”医生叫道，急忙拉下前面的玻璃，冲着车夫大喊，“可千万不要飞速前进啊，这才配得上我的步伐。听到了吗？”","“Halloa!” cried the doctor, letting down the front glass in a great hurry, and shouting to the postillion; “something very short of flying will keep pace with me.Do you hear?”"
"车铃发出叮当声，车轮则咔嗒作响，直到马车走出了一段距离，才听不见这些声音。只能看见它飞快地向前驶去。马车在蜿蜒的大道上飞驰，几乎湮没在扬起的尘土里：时而完全不见，时而又清晰可见，这要看是否有东西遮挡住了视线或者路况的曲折程度。直到连扬起的尘土都看不见了，目送马车远去的人才散去。","Jingling and clattering, till distance rendered its noise inaudible, and its rapid progress only perceptible to the eye, the vehicle wound its way along the road, almost hidden in a cloud of dust: now wholly disappearing, and now becoming visible again, as intervening objects, or the intricacies of the way, permitted.It was not until even the dusty cloud was no longer to be seen, that the gazers dispersed."
"然而，直到马车已驶出去几英里了，还有一位送行者仍盯着它消失的地方；刚才哈里望向窗户时，并没有看到被白色窗帘遮住了的、就坐在窗边的罗丝。","And there was one looker-on, who remained with eyes fixed upon the spot where the carriage had disappeared, long after it was many miles away; for, behind the white curtain which had shrouded her from view when Harry raised his eyes towards the window, sat Rose herself."
"“他看起来精神十足，也很快乐。”她终于说道，“我还曾经担心他会很难过呢。看来是我错了。这样，我也非常、非常高兴。”","“He seems in high spirits and happy,” she said, at length.“I feared for a time he might be otherwise.I was mistaken.I am very, very glad.”"
"眼泪既能象征悲伤，也能象征喜悦；但是当罗丝若有所思地坐在窗前，仍旧注视着那个方向时，那些顺着她脸庞滑落的泪水却是哀多过喜。","Tears are signs of gladness as well as grief; but those which coursed down Rose’s face, as she sat pensively at the window, still gazing in the same direction, seemed to tell more of sorrow than of joy."
"第三十七章 在本章里，读者将看到婚姻生活里司空见惯的反差情形","CHAPTER XXXVII In which the reader may perceive a contrast, not uncommon in matrimonial cases "
"邦布尔先生坐在济贫院的会客室里，闷闷不乐地盯着死气沉沉的壁炉，因为是夏天，除了阳光照在冰冷、闪亮的炉壁上反射出来的几道微弱的光芒以外，就没有更为明亮的光线了。天花板上吊着一只晃晃荡荡的纸制捕蝇笼，邦布尔先生时不时满心郁闷地抬头看一眼；几只小虫子绕着花哨的网兜随心所欲地飞来飞去，邦布尔先生深深地叹口气，脸上现出一道更沉郁的阴影。他沉思着，大概是那几只小虫子使他想起了生命中某些痛苦的往事。","Mr. Bumble sat in the workhouse parlour, with his eyes moodily fixed on the cheerless grate, whence, as it was summer time, no brighter gleam proceeded, than the reflection of certain sickly rays of the sun, which were sent back from its cold and shining surface.A paper fly-cage dangled from the ceiling, to which he occasionally raised his eyes in gloomy thought; and, as the heedless insects hovered round the gaudy net-work, Mr. Bumble would heave a deep sigh, while a more gloomy shadow overspread his countenance.Mr. Bumble was meditating; it might be that the insects brought to mind, some painful passage in his own past life."
"旁观者的心里也不禁泛起一阵愉悦的伤感之情，倒不仅仅是因为邦布尔先生的阴郁。不需要更多证明，那些与他本人紧密相连的情形表明，他的生活处境已经发生了翻天覆地的变化。那件带花边的外套，还有三角帽，都到哪里去了？他仍穿着长及膝部的短裤，腿上套着深色棉袜；但短裤已不是原来的那条。外套还是宽边式的，这一点跟从前的那件很像，不过，哦，还是截然不同的。以前那顶帽边向上卷的、气派的三角帽，如今却换成了一顶朴素的圆帽子。邦布尔先生不再是一位教区执事了。","Nor was Mr. Bumble’s gloom the only thing calculated to awaken a pleasing melancholy in the bosom of a spectator.There were not wanting other appearances, and those closely connected with his own person, which announced that a great change had taken place in the position of his affairs.The laced coat, and the cocked hat; where were they?He still wore knee-breeches, and dark cotton stockings on his nether limbs; but they were not the breeches.The coat was wide-skirted; and in that respect like the coat, but, oh how different!The mighty cocked hat was replaced by a modest round one.Mr. Bumble was no longer a beadle."
"生活中时有升迁，且不说由此带来的更可观的好处，升迁需要体现出特别的价值和威严都在与此相关的外套和背心上了。陆军元帅有相配的军装；主教有自己的丝质法衣；律师有丝绸长袍；执事则有三角帽。若是脱了主教的法衣，或者摘去教区执事的帽子，脱下他的带花边的外套，他们还有什么身份？就只是普通百姓了。有时，一个人的尊严，甚至神圣，与外套和背心的关系要比人们想象的紧密得多。","There are some promotions in life, which, independent of the more substantial rewards they offer, require peculiar value and dignity from the coats and waistcoats connected with them.A field-marshal has his uniform; a bishop his silk apron; a counsellor his silk gown; a beadle his cocked hat.Strip the bishop of his apron, or the beadle of his hat and lace; what are they?Men.Mere men.Dignity, and even holiness too, sometimes, are more questions of coat and waistcoat than some people imagine."
"邦布尔先生娶了科尼太太，成了济贫院的院长。另一位教区执事上任了。卷边三角帽、带金边的外套，以及手杖，这三件全都传给了下一任教区执事。","Mr. Bumble had married Mrs. Corney, and was master of the workhouse.Another beadle had come into power.On him the cocked hat, gold-laced coat, and staff, had all three descended."
"“到明天,这事就过去两个月了！”邦布尔先生叹了口气，说道，“感觉就像过去了一辈子那么长。”","“And to-morrow two months it was done!” said Mr. Bumble, with a sigh.“It seems a age.”"
"邦布尔先生也许是想说，他把一辈子的幸福都集中在那短短的八个星期里。但是那声叹息——那声叹息可是意味深长。","Mr. Bumble might have meant that he had concentrated a whole existence of happiness into the short space of eight weeks; but the sigh—there was a vast deal of meaning in the sigh."
"“我把自己给卖了，”邦布尔先生顺着思路说道，“就是为了六把汤匙、一双糖夹子和一口牛奶锅，再加上少得可怜的二手家具和二十英镑。真是个好价钱。便宜，卖得也太便宜了！”","“I sold myself,” said Mr. Bumble, pursuing the same train of relection, “for six teaspoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, and a milk-pot; with a small quantity of second-hand furniture, and twenty pound in money.I went very reasonable.Cheap, dirt cheap!”"
"“便宜！”一个尖锐的声音在邦布尔先生耳边响起，“不管出什么价买你都是贵的，我出的价已经很高了，上帝心里明白！”","“Cheap!” cried a shrill voice in Mr. Bumble’s ear：“you would have been dear at any price; and dear enough I paid for you, Lord above knows that!”"
"邦布尔先生转过身去，他那位有趣的妻子正好映入眼帘。她无意中听到丈夫的抱怨，并没有彻底明白那几句话，就未经考虑地尝试着发表一通上述感言。","Mr. Bumble turned, and encountered the face of his interesting consort, who, imperfectly comprehending the few words she had overheard of his complaint, had hazarded the foregoing remark at a venture."
"“邦布尔太太，夫人！”邦布尔先生带着一种伤感而严厉的语气说。","“Mrs. Bumble, ma’am!” said Mr. Bumble, with a sentimental sternness."
"“怎么！”女士高声叫道。","“Well!” cried the lady."
"“行行好，看着我。”邦布尔先生盯着她说。（“如果她能受得了这样的眼神，”邦布尔先生对自己说道，“那么她就没什么受不了的了。这种眼神用在那些穷人身上从来没有失败过。如果在她身上失效了，我的权威就尽失了。”）对于那些吃不饱饭、状况很差的穷人们来说，是否只稍微瞪一瞪眼就能让他们乖乖听话；或者，已故的科尼先生的遗孀是不是正好不畏惧尖锐的目光，各位的见解可能不尽相同。事实上，这位主妇一点儿也没有被邦布尔先生的怒容压倒。相反，她对此极为鄙夷，甚至发出一阵笑声，听起来倒像是发自肺腑的。","“Have the goodness to look at me,” said Mr. Bumble, fixing his eyes upon her. (If she stands such a eye as that,” said Mr. Bumble to himself, “she can stand anything.It is a eye I never knew to fail with paupers.If it fails with her, my power is gone.”) Whether an exceedingly small expansion of eye be sufficient to quell paupers, who, being lightly fed, are in no very high condition; or whether the late Mrs. Corney was particularly proof against eagle glances; are matters of opinion.The matter of fact, is, that the matron was in no way overpowered by Mr. Bumble’s scowl, but, on the contrary, treated it with great disdain, and even raised a laugh thereat, which sounded as though it were genuine."
"邦布尔先生听到这始料未及的笑声，先是露出不可置信的表情，接着便惊住了。于是他又恢复到原有的状态，直到他那位伴侣的声音再一次引起他的注意，邦布尔先生才又清醒过来。","On hearing this most unexpected sound, Mr. Bumble looked, first incredulous, and afterwards amazed.He then relapsed into his former state; nor did he rouse himself until his attention was again awakened by the voice of his partner."
"“你就打算一整天都坐在这里打呼噜？”邦布尔太太问道。","“Are you going to sit snoring there, all day?” inquired Mrs. Bumble."
"“我是打算坐在这里，只要我觉得合适，想坐多久就坐多久，夫人。”邦布尔先生回答，“尽管我刚才并没有打呼噜，但是只要我高兴，我就可以打呼噜、打哈欠、打喷嚏，大笑或者大哭，这是我的特权。”","“I am going to sit here, as long as I think proper, ma’am,” rejoined Mr. Bumble; “and although I was not snoring, I shall snore, gape, sneeze, laugh, or cry, as the humour strikes me; such being my prerogative.”"
"“你的——特权！”邦布尔太太冷笑着说，脸上带着难以形容的轻蔑。","“—Your—prerogative!” sneered Mrs. Bumble, with ineffable contempt."
"“我说的正是那个字眼，夫人。”邦布尔先生说，“一个男人的特权就是下达命令。”","“I said the word, ma’am,” said Mr. Bumble.“The prerogative of a man is to command.”"
"“那么，看在上帝份上，什么是女人的特权？”科尼先生的遗孀叫道。","“And what’s the prerogative of a woman, in the name of Goodness?” cried the relict of Mr. Corner deceased."
"“服从命令，夫人。”邦布尔先生大声吼道，“你那倒霉的死去的丈夫真是应该教教你，那么，说不定他也能活到现在了。我真希望他还活着，可怜的人！”","“To obey, ma’am,” thundered Mr. Bumble.“Your late unfortunate husband should have taught it you; and then, perhaps, he might have been alive now.I wish he was, poor man!”"
"邦布尔太太一眼就看出，现在到了决定性的时刻了，为夺取控制权，双方都有必要做出致命的最后一击。因此，一听到他提起死去的人，邦布尔太太便瘫倒在椅子上，眼泪夺眶而出，尖声哭叫着邦布尔先生是一个硬心肠的野兽。","Mrs. Bumble, seeing at a glance, that the decisive moment had now arrived, and that a blow struck for the mastership on one side or other, must necessarily be final and conclusive, no sooner heard this allusion to the dead and gone, than she dropped into a chair, and with a loud scream that Mr. Bumble was a hard-hearted brute, fell into a paroxysm of tears."
"然而，眼泪在邦布尔先生身上完全不起作用，他的心与水绝缘。就像可清洗的獭皮帽子越淋雨越好一样，他的神经接受了眼泪的洗礼后，变得愈加顽强和有力。眼泪代表了软弱，此时也代表了对他个人威信的默认，这让他高兴，认为是对自己的礼赞。他带着极大的满足感看着自己的好太太，用一种鼓励的语气恳求她尽最大努力哭出来；从功能这个角度来说，这种锻炼十分有助于健康。","But, tears were not the things to find their way to Mr. Bumble’s soul; his heart was waterproof.Like washable beaver hats that improve with rain, his nerves were rendered stouter and more vigorous, by showers of tears, which, being tokens of weakness, and so far tacit admissions of his own power, pleased and exalted him.He eyed his good lady with looks of great satisfaction, and begged, in an encouraging manner, that she should cry her hardest: the exercise being looked upon, by the faculty, as strongly conducive to health."
"“哭能够敞开肺脏，清洗面孔，活动眼睛，而且能够平息愤怒。”邦布尔先生说，“放声哭吧。”","“It opens the lungs, washes the countenance, exercises the eyes, and softens down the temper,” said Mr. Bumble.“So cry away.”"
"说完这番取乐的话，邦布尔先生从挂帽钉上取下帽子，相当随意地歪着戴上，正如一个人感觉自己以一种合适的方式维护了优势地位那样。他手插在口袋里，晃晃荡荡地走到门口，整个人一副悠闲自得、诙谐可笑的样子。","As he discharged himself of this pleasantry, Mr. Bumble took his hat from a peg, and putting it on, rather rakishly, on one side, as a man might, who felt he had asserted his superiority in a becoming manner, thrust his hands into his pockets, and sauntered towards the door, with much ease and waggishness depicted in his whole appearance."
"科尼太太首先尝试了眼泪这一招，因为它比动手打人要省事；不过，她也准备好了要试一试后一种方法，邦布尔先生马上就会领教到。","Now, Mrs. Corney that was, had tried the tears, because they were less troublesome than a manual assault; but, she was quite prepared to make trial of the latter mode of proceeding, as Mr. Bumble was not long in discovering."
"他体会到这个事实的第一个证据就是有东西打在某个物体上发出了沉闷声，紧接着他的帽子忽然飞向房间的另一端。这一准备活动使他头上没了遮盖，于是这位专家级的太太一只手紧紧地掐住他的脖子，另一只手则照着脑袋雨点般地打下去（力气非凡，技术精湛）。这一招之后，她又略略改变了战术，开始抓他的脸，扯他的头发；至此，她认为对于邦布尔先生刚才的冒犯已经做出了足够的惩罚，于是就把他推到一张位置正合适的椅子上，使他和椅子一起摔倒在地，又问他还敢不敢再说什么特权。","The first proof he experienced of the fact, was conveyed in a hollow sound, immediately succeeded by the sudden flying off of his hat to the opposite end of the room.This preliminary proceeding laying bare his head, the expert lady, clasping him tightly round the throat with one hand, inflicted a shower of blows (dealt with singular vigour and dexterity) upon it with the other.This done, she created a little variety by scratching his face, and tearing his hair; and, having, by this time, inflicted as much punishment as she deemed necessary for the offence, she pushed him over a chair, which was luckily well situated for the purpose: and defied him to talk about his prerogative again, if he dared."
"“起来！”邦布尔太太用一种命令的语气喝道，“赶紧滚出去，如果你不想我让做出什么不要命的事情。”","“Get up!” said Mrs. Bumble, in a voice of command.“And take yourself away from here, unless you want me to do something desperate.”"
"邦布尔先生面色悲戚地站起身来，心里琢磨着那不要命的事情究竟是什么。他捡起帽子，朝门口看了看。","Mr. Bumble rose with a very rueful countenance: wondering much what something desperate might be.Picking up his hat, he looked towards the door."
"“还不走？”邦布尔太太问道。","“Are you going?” demanded Mrs. Bumble."
"“当然，亲爱的，当然。”邦布尔先生回答道，快速地朝门口走去。“我不是有意——我就走，亲爱的！你太粗暴了，真让我——”这会儿，邦布尔太太匆匆地走过去，想要把地毯整理成原样，毯子在刚才那场混战中被踢乱了。邦布尔先生没来得及把话说完，就立刻冲出了房间，把整个战场留给了前科尼太太。","“Certainly, my dear, certainly,” rejoined Mr. Bumble, making a quicker motion towards the door.“I didn’t intend to—I’m going, my dear!You are so very violent, that really I—” At this instant, Mrs. Bumble stepped hastily forward to replace the carpet, which had been kicked up in the scuffle.Mr. Bumble immediately darted out of the room, without bestowing another thought on his unfinished sentence: leaving the late Mrs. Corney in full possession of the field."
"邦布尔先生相当吃惊，也着实挨了一顿打。很明显，他有一种欺凌弱小的倾向，并从那种微不足道的残酷中获得了绝非微不足道的乐趣，结果（自然用不着说）成了个胆小鬼。这绝不是对他性格的贬低，许多备受敬仰的官场要人也是类似弱点的受害者。确实，说这句话并没有什么其他意思，而是为了他好，想要让读者对他执行公务的能力有一个公平的判断。","Mr. Bumble was fairly taken by surprise, and fairly beaten.He had a decided propensity for bullying: derived no inconsiderable pleasure from the exercise of petty cruelty; and, consequently, was (it is needless to say) a coward.This is by no means a disparagement to his character; for many official personages, who are held in high respect and admiration, are the victims of similar infirmities.The remark is made, indeed, rather in his favour than otherwise, and with a view of impressing the reader with a just sense of his qualifications for office."
"但是，他出丑还没有出完。他绕着屋子走了一圈，平生头一次想到，济贫法对人实在是太苛刻了；那些把妻子丢给教区，自己跑掉的男人，公平地说，根本不该受到惩罚，相反，倒是应该作为饱经苦难的有功人士而获得嘉奖。邦布尔先生走向一间屋子，这里通常会有些女贫民负责清洗从教区送来的麻布衣衫。这时屋里传来说话的声音。","But, the measure of his degradation was not yet full.After making a tour of the house, and thinking, for the first time, that the poor-laws really were too hard on people; and that men who ran away from their wives, leaving them chargeable to the parish, ought, in justice to be visited with no punishment at all, but rather rewarded as meritorious individuals who had suffered much;Mr. Bumble came to a room where some of the female paupers were usually employed in washing the parish linen: when the sound of voices in conversation, now proceeded."
"“哼！”邦布尔先生说道，又摆出他原来那副威风的架子。“至少这些女人会尊重这样的特权。喂！喂，那边！你们吵吵嚷嚷地干什么呢，你们这群粗野的人？”","“Hem!” said Mr. Bumble, summoning up all his native dignity.“These women at least shall continue to respect the prerogative.Hallo! hallo there!What do you mean by this noise, you hussies?”"
"邦布尔一边这样说着，一边推开门，怒气冲冲地走了进去。可当他的目光始料未及地落在自己那位夫人身上时，这副面容立刻变成了一种卑微怯懦的样子。","With these words, Mr. Bumble opened the door, and walked in with a very fierce and angry manner: which was at once exchanged for a most humiliated and cowering air, as his eyes unexpectedly rested on the form of his lady wife."
"“亲爱的，”邦布尔先生说，“我没想到你也在这里。”","“My dear,” said Mr. Bumble, “I didn’t know you were here.”"
"“没想到我在这里！”邦布尔太太重复道，“你到这里来做——什——么？”","“Didn’t know I was here!” repeated Mrs. Bumble.“What do—you—do here?”"
"“我以为她们一直在说话，怕是不能好好干活，亲爱的。”邦布尔先生回答，他心烦意乱地瞥了一眼站在洗衣盆那边的两个老婆子，她俩看到院长这种卑微的态度，都很钦佩，交头接耳地讨论着。","“I thought they were talking rather too much to be doing their work properly, my dear,” replied Mr. Bumble: glancing distractedly at a couple of old women at the wash-tub, who were comparing notes of admiration at the workhouse-master’s humility."
"“你——觉得她们说话太多了？”邦布尔太太说，“关你什么事？”","“—You—thought they were talking too much?” said Mrs. Bumble.“What business is it of yours?”"
"“哎，亲爱的——”邦布尔先生支吾着，一副恭顺的样子。","“Why, my dear—” urged Mr. Bumble submissively."
"“关你什么事？”邦布尔太太又逼问道。","“What business is it of yours?” demanded Mrs. Bumble, again."
"“没错，您是这儿的头，亲爱的。”邦布尔先生屈服了，“不过，我刚才以为，你这会儿也许不在这里。”","“It’s very true, you’re matron here, my dear,” submitted Mr. Bumble; “but I thought you mightn’t be in the way just then.”"
"“我告诉你，邦布尔先生，”他的太太回答道，“我们不需要你多管闲事。你也太喜欢掺和跟自己不相关的事情了，转身就让全院的人笑话。你每时每刻看起来都跟个傻瓜似的。出去，快！”","“I’ll tell you what, Mr. Bumble,” returned his lady.“We don’t want any of your interference.You’re a great deal too fond of poking your nose into things that don’t concern you, making everybody in the house laugh, the moment your back is turned, and making yourself look like a fool every hour in the day.Be off; come!”"
"邦布尔先生见到那两个老婆子乐开了花，吃吃地偷笑着，感到极度难受，不禁犹豫了一下。邦布尔太太一点儿耐心也没有了，端起一盆肥皂水，指着门的方向，命令他马上离开，要不然就让他那肥胖的身子尝尝肥皂水的味道。","Mr. Bumble, seeing with excruciating feelings, the delight of the two old paupers, who were tittering together most rapturously, hesitated for an instant.Mrs. Bumble, whose patience brooked no delay, caught up a bowl of soap-suds, and motioning him towards the door, ordered him instantly to depart, on pain of receiving the contents upon his portly person."
"邦布尔先生还能怎么办呢？他沮丧地四下看了看，就溜走了；当他走到门口的时候，那些女贫民咯咯的发笑声爆发成一种无法抑制的大笑。少的就是这个。他在她们眼中丢尽了脸，他在这群贫民面前失去了身份和地位；他从教区执事的华丽高位跌到了最被人不齿的、怕老婆的深渊。","What could Mr. Bumble do?He looked dejectedly round, and slunk away; and, as he reached the door, the titterings of the paupers broke into a shrill chuckle of irrepressible delight.It wanted but this.He was degraded in their eyes; he had lost caste and station before the very paupers; he had fallen from all the height and pomp of beadleship, to the lowest depth of the most snubbed hen-peckery."
"“仅仅是两个月的时间！”邦布尔先生满心凄凉，说道，“两个月！两个月之前，我不仅能替自己作主，也是这济贫院里其他所有人的主人，可是现在——”实在是难以接受。邦布尔先生给了替他开门的小男孩一个耳光（满腹心事的邦布尔先生已经来到大门口），心烦意乱地走到街上。","“All in two months!” said Mr. Bumble, filled with dismal thoughts.“Two months!No more than two months ago, I was not only my own master, but everybody else’s, so far as the porochial workhouse was concerned, and now!—”It was too much.Mr. Bumble boxed the ears of the boy who opened the gate for him (for he had reached the portal in his reverie); and walked, distractedly, into the street."
"他走过了一条又一条街，直到他悲哀的情绪开始缓解，这种情绪上的急剧转变让他觉得口渴。他走过许多家酒吧，最终在一家小路上的酒吧门口停住脚。他透过百叶窗匆匆地朝里望了一眼，看见单间里空空的，只有一个顾客。这时，下起了大雨。这让他做出了决定。邦布尔先生走了进去，经过吧台时点了一些喝的，然后走进他在街上看到的单间里。","He walked up one street, and down another, until exercise had abated the first passion of his grief; and then the revulsion of feeling made him thirsty.He passed a great many public-houses; but, at length paused before one in a by-way, whose parlour, as he gathered from a hasty peep over the blinds, was deserted, save by one solitary customer.It began to rain, heavily, at the moment.This determined him.Mr. Bumble stepped in; and ordering something to drink, as he passed the bar, entered the apartment into which he had looked from the street."
"坐在里面的那个人，个子高高的，皮肤很黑，披着一件大斗篷。他看起来不太像本地人，从那憔悴的神情以及衣服上的尘土来看，他好像是走了很远的路。邦布尔先生进来时，对他打了个招呼。他侧目瞟了邦布尔先生一眼，仅仅点了一下头算是回应。","The man who was seated there, was tall and dark, and wore a large cloak.He had the air of a stranger; and seemed, by a certain haggardness in his look, as well as by the dusty soils on his dress, to have travelled some distance.He eyed Bumble askance, as he entered, but scarcely deigned to nod his head in acknowledgment of his salutation."
"邦布尔先生本来就比一般人傲慢些，即使陌生人更容易亲近，他也不一定会搭理人家。因此，他默默地喝着掺了水的杜松子酒，摆出极虚荣的姿态读起了报纸。","Mr. Bumble had quite dignity enough for two; supposing even that the stranger had been more familiar: so he drank his gin-and-water in silence, and read the paper with great show of pomp and circumstance."
"然而，人们在这种情况下往往会走到一起，现在也是如此。邦布尔先生不时地感到一种强烈的、不可抑制的冲动，想要偷瞄那人一两眼。每当他这么做时，又总是慌乱地收回眼光，因为他发现那个陌生人同时也在偷偷地瞧着他。那陌生人的眼里带着一种非同寻常的神态，目光犀利而明亮，却蒙着一层猜忌和怀疑的怒气。邦布尔先生以前从没见过这样令人讨厌的目光，不禁感到更加难堪。","It so happened, however: as it will happen very often, when men fall into company under such circumstances: that Mr. Bumble felt, every now and then, a powerful inducement, which he could not resist, to steal a look at the stranger: and that whenever he did so, he withdrew his eyes, in some confusion, to find that the stranger was at that moment stealing a look at him.Mr. Bumble’s awkwardness was enhanced by the very remarkable expression of the stranger’s eye, which was keen and bright, but shadowed by a scowl of distrust and suspicion, unlike anything he had ever observed before, and repulsive to behold."
"他们这样对望了几次，那陌生人用一种低沉刺耳的声音打破了沉默。","When they had encountered each other’s glance several times in this way, the stranger, in a harsh, deep voice, broke silence."
"“你刚才从窗户外往里张望时，”他说，“是在找我吗？”","“Were you looking for me,” he said, “when you peered in at the window?”"
"“我没这个意思，除非你是——”邦布尔先生在这儿打住，他很想知道陌生人的名字，就耐心等着，以为对方会接着他的话说下去。","“Not that I am aware of, unless you’re Mr. —” Here Mr. Bumble stopped short; for he was curious to know the stranger’s name, and thought in his impatience, he might supply the blank."
"“我看你也没有，”陌生人说，唇边悄无声息地露出一丝讽刺的味道，“不然你应该是知道我的名字的。而你不知道。我劝你不要打听我的名字。”","“I see you were not,” said the stranger; an expression of quiet sarcasm playing about his mouth; “or you have known my name.You don’t know it.I would recommend you not to ask for it.”"
"“我可没有恶意，年轻人。”邦布尔先生庄重地说。","“I meant no harm, young man,” observed Mr. Bumble, majestically."
"“你没做什么不好的事。”陌生人说。","“And have done none,” said the stranger."
"这段简短的对话过后又是一阵沉默，然后陌生人又开口打破僵局。","Another silence succeeded this short dialogue: which was again broken by the stranger."
"“我想，我以前见过你？”他说，“那时你的衣着很不一样，我当时只是在街上从你身边走过，不过我还是能认出你来。你曾经是这儿的教区执事，对不对？”","“I have seen you before, I think?” said he.“You were differently dressed at that time, and I only passed you in the street, but I should know you again.You were beadle here, once; were you not?”"
"“我以前是，”邦布尔先生有些吃惊，“教区执事。”","“I was,” said Mr. Bumble, in some surprise; “porochial beadle.”"
"“没错。”另一位说道，点了点头。“我那次看见你时，你正是这个职务。你现在是什么身份？”","“Just so,” rejoined the other, nodding his head.“It was in that character I saw you.What are you now?”"
"“济贫院院长。”邦布尔先生慢慢说道，尽量给人以深刻的印象，免得让陌生人产生过分亲切的感觉。“济贫院院长，年轻人！”","“Master of the workhouse,” rejoined Mr. Bumble, slowly and impressively, to check any undue familiarity the stranger might otherwise assume.“Master of the workhouse, young man!”"
"“不过，你还不是老样子，只关心自己的利益，没错吧？”陌生人接着说。邦布尔先生听到这个问题，有些惊讶地抬起头来，陌生人则用锐利的目光盯着他。","“You have the same eye to your own interest, that you always had, I doubt not?” resumed the stranger, looking kneely into Mr. Bumble’s eyes, as he raised them in astonishment at the question."
"“别犹豫，直说了吧，伙计。你瞧，我很了解你。”","“Don’t scruple to answer freely, man.I know you pretty well, you see.”"
"”我想，一个结了婚的男人，”邦布尔先生回答道，一边用手遮住光线，从头到脚地打量了陌生人一番，明显还是不知所措，“和单身男人一样，要是能老老实实地挣两个钱，都不会有意见的。教区执事薪酬不高，所以不会拒绝赚些外快的机会的，只要是正大光明的手段得来的。”","“I suppose, a married man,” replied Mr. Bumble, shading his eyes with his hand, and surveying the stranger, from head to foot, in evident perplexity, “is not more averse to turning an honest penny when he can, than a single one.Porochial officers are not so well paid that they can afford to refuse any little extra fee, when it comes to them in a civil and proper manner.”"
"陌生人微笑了，又点了点头，好像在说他并没有看错人，然后拉了一下铃。","The stranger smiled, and nodded his head again: as much to say, he had not mistaken his man; then rang the bell."
"“再把杯子满上。”他一边说，一边把邦布尔先生的空玻璃杯递给店主。“来杯热热的烈酒。我想，你喜欢这个吧？”","“Fill this glass again,” he said, handing Mr. Bumble’s empty tumbler to the landlord.“Let it be strong and hot.You like it so, I suppose?”"
"“不要太烈。”邦布尔先生轻咳一声，说道。","“Not too strong,” replied Mr. Bumble, with a delicate cough."
"“你知道那是什么意思，老板！”陌生人冷淡地说。","“You understand what that means, landlord!” said the stranger, drily."
"店主笑着离开了，过了一会儿又拿着一杯热气腾腾的酒回来了。邦布尔先生刚喝了一口，就呛出了眼泪。","The host smiled, disappeared, and shortly afterwards returned with a steaming jorum: of which, the first gulp brought the water into Mr. Bumble’s eyes."
"“现在，听我说。”陌生人关上了门窗，说道，“我今天来到这里，就是要把你找出来。有时候，还真是因为什么鬼运气，正当我心里想着你的时候，你就碰巧走进我在的这间房里来了。我向你打听点儿事。尽管是些小事，我也不会叫你白白告诉我的。先把这个收着。”","“Now listen to me,” said the stranger, after closing the door and window.“I came down to this place, to-day, to find you out; and, by one of those chances which the devil throws in the way of his friends sometimes, you walked into the very room I was sitting in, while you were uppermost in my mind.I want some information from you.I don’t ask you to give it for nothing, slight as it is.Put up that, to begin with.”"
"说着，他小心地把两块金币推给桌子对面的同伴，好像不想让人听见钱币的叮当声。邦布尔先生仔细地把金币检查了一番，确定都是真的，然后心满意足地把它们放进背心口袋里。陌生人接着说道，“把你的记忆拉回到——我想想——十二年前的那个冬天。”","As he spoke, he pushed a couple of sovereigns across the table to his companion, carefully, as though unwilling that the chinking of money should be heard without.When Mr. Bumble had scrupulously examined the coins, to see that they were genuine, and had put them up, with much satisfaction, in his waistcoat-pocket, he went on: “Carry your memory back—let me see—twelve years, last winter.”"
"“那可是很久远了。”邦布尔先生说，“很好。我想起来了。”","“It’s a long time,” said Mr. Bumble.“Very good.I’ve  done it.”"
"“地点是在济贫院。”","“The scene, the workhouse.”"
"“好！”","“Good!”"
"“时间是晚上。”","“And the time, night.”"
"“是的。”","“Yes.”"
"“场景，那个破烂窝里，不管它在哪儿，一些凄惨的娼妓们，自己的性命和健康都不能保证——却还生出些体弱的小孩子，交给教区抚养，然后把她们的丑事都带进坟墓，烂在里面了！”","“And the place, the crazy hole, wherever it was, in which miserable drabs brought forth the life and health so often denied to themselves—gave birth to puling children for the parish to rear; and hid their shame, rot ‘em in the grave!”"
"“我想，是产房吧？”邦布尔先生说道，他不太能跟得上那陌生人的慷慨陈词。","“The lying-in room, I suppose?” said Mr. Bumble, not quite following the stranger’s excited descripition."
"“对，就是那里。”陌生人说，“有个男孩子出生在那里。”","“Yes,” said the stranger.“A boy was born there.”"
"“那里出生过很多男孩。”邦布尔先生失望地摇了摇头，说道。","“A many boys,” observed Mr. Bumble, shaking his head, despondingly."
"“那些该死的小鬼！”陌生人喊道，“我说的是有一个男孩，看起来柔弱苍白，在一个做棺材的那里当学徒——我倒希望他给自己也做了一口，自己躺进去，再拧上螺丝——听说后来跑到伦敦去了。”","“A murrain on the young devils!” cried the stranger;“I speak of one; a meek-looking, pale-faced boy, who was apprenticed down here, to a coffin-maker—I wish he had made his coffin, and screwed his body in it—and who afterwards ran away to London, as it was supposed.”"
"“啊，你是说奥利弗啊！小特威斯特！”邦布尔先生说道，“我当然记得他。再没有比他更固执的捣蛋鬼了——”“我要打听的不是他,我已经听够了他的事了。”邦布尔先生正准备就奥利弗的种种劣迹发表一番长篇大论，刚起个头就被陌生人给打断了。“我想打听的是个女人，照顾过他母亲的那个老婆子。她现在在哪儿？”","“Why, you mean Oliver!Young Twist!” said Mr. Bumble;“I remember him, of course.There wasn’t a obstinater young rascal—” “It’s not of him I want to hear; I’ve  heard enough of him,” said the stranger, stopping Mr. Bumble in the outset of a tirade on the subject of poor Oliver’s vices.“It’s of a woman; the hag that nursed his mother.Where is she?”"
"“她现在在哪儿？”邦布尔先生喝多了掺水的杜松子酒，开起玩笑起来。“那可真不好说了。无论她去哪儿了，那地方都不需要接生婆，所以我觉得不管怎么样，她是没活干了。”","“Where is she?” said Mr. Bumble, whom the gin-and-water had rendered facetious.“It would be hard to tell.There’s no midwifery there, whichever place she’s gone to; so I suppose she’s out of employment, anyway.”"
"“你是什么意思？”陌生人厉声问道。","“What do you mean?” demanded the stranger, sternly."
"“我的意思是去年冬天她死了。”邦布尔先生答道。","“That she died last winter,” rejoined Mr. Bumble."
"陌生人听到这个消息，盯着邦布尔先生看了一会儿。虽然接下来的一段时间里，他并没有把眼光移开，但他的目光却渐渐变得空洞飘渺起来，似乎陷入了沉思。好一阵，他看上去并不知道听到这个消息究竟是该觉得宽慰还是失望。不过，最终他舒了口气，移开目光，说这也不是什么要紧的事。说着站起身来，好像要离开了。","The man looked fixedly at him when he had given this information, and although he did not withdraw his eyes for some time afterwards, his gaze gradually became vacant and abstracted, and he seemed lost in thought.For some time, he appeared doubtful whether he ought to be relieved or disappointed by the intelligence; but at length he breathed more freely; and withdrawing his eyes, observed that it was no great matter.With that he rose, as if to depart."
"不过邦布尔先生是很狡猾的，他立刻看出机会来了，可以从他那位贤内助掌握的一些秘密中大赚一笔。他对老萨莉去世的那天晚上记得清清楚楚，那天正是他向科尼太太求婚的日子，发生了很多事，有充分的理由让他记得那一天。太太是那件事的唯一见证人，虽然她从未对他吐露事情经过，但他已经听说很多，知道那些都与在济贫院做护士的老妇人在照料奥利弗·特威斯特年轻的母亲时，发生的一些事有关。","But Mr. Bumble was cunning enough; and he at once saw that an opportunity was opened, for the lucrative disposal of some secret in the possession of his better half.He well remembered the night of old Sally’s death, which the occurrences of that day had given him good reason to recollect, as the occasion on which he had proposed to Mrs. Corney; and although that lady had never confided to him the disclosure of which she had been the solitary witness, he had heard enough to know that it related to something that had occurred in the old woman’s attendance, as workhouse nurse, upon the young mother of Oliver Twist."
"他很快就想到这个情况，便神神秘秘地告诉陌生人，那老妇人临死前曾经和一个女人密谈过。而他有理由相信，那个女人能给他要打听的事提供些线索。","Hastily calling this circumstance to mind, he informed the stranger, with an air of mystery, that one woman had been closeted with the old harridan shortly before she died; and that she could, as he had reason to believe, throw some light on the subject of his inquiry."
"“我怎么能找到她？”陌生人说，完全没了戒备，明显表现出，听到这个消息后，他的所有恐惧（无论是为什么）又都重新回来了。","“How can I find her?” said the stranger, thrown off his guard; and plainly showing that all his fears (whatever they were) were aroused afresh by the intelligence."
"“只能靠我。”邦布尔先生回答。","“Only through me,” rejoined Mr. Bumble."
"“什么时候？”陌生人焦急地大声问道。","“When?” cried the stranger, hastily."
"“明天。”邦布尔说。","“To-morrow,” rejoined Bumble."
"“晚上九点钟，”陌生人说，掏出一小片纸，在上面写上了一个很不起眼的地址，那是在河边，从那字迹上看得出，他很激动不安，“晚上九点钟，带她到这儿来。不用我告诉你要保密了吧。这对你有好处。”","“At nine in the evening,” said the stranger, producing a scrap of paper, and writing down upon it, an obscure address by the water-side, in characters that betrayed his agitation; “at nine in the evening, bring her to me there.I needn’t tell you to be secret. it’s your interest.”"
"说着，他朝门口走去，中途停下付了酒钱。他说了一句两人要走不一样的路，又强调了一下第二天见面的时间，再没说什么客套话，就离开了。","With these words, he led the way to the door, after stopping to pay for the liquor that had been drunk.Shortly remarking that their roads were different, he departed, without more ceremony than an emphatic repetition of the hour of appointment for the following night."
"济贫院院长瞟了一眼地址，发现上面没写名字。陌生人还没走远，所以他赶上去想要打听明白。","On glancing at the address, the parochial functionary observed that it contained no name.The stranger had not gone far, so he made after him to ask it."
"“你想干什么？”邦布尔拍了拍陌生人的肩膀，那人猛地转过身来，大声说，“你在跟踪我？”","“What do you want?” cried the man, turning quickly round, as Bumble touched him on the arm. “Following me?”"
"“只是问个问题。”邦布尔先生说，指了指小纸片。“我要找的人叫什么名字呢？”","“Only to ask a question,” said the other, pointing to the scrap of paper.“What name am I to ask for?”"
"“蒙克斯！”那人说完，就匆匆忙忙地走开了。","“Monks!” rejoined the man; and strode hastily, away."
"第三十八章 本章记述了邦布尔夫妇与蒙克斯先生的夜间会晤","CHAPTER XXXVIII Containing an account of what passed between Mr. and Mrs. bumble, and Mr. monks, at their nocturnal interview   "
"那是一个天气阴沉、闷热潮湿的夏夜。整个白天都是阴云密布。晚上，乌云散作浓厚凝滞的大团水汽，并凝聚成大滴的雨点，似乎预示着一场猛烈的暴风雨将要来临。此时，邦布尔夫妇刚拐出镇上的大街，朝着大约一英里半开外的一个小居民点走去。那里零落地散布着一些破旧的房屋，坐落在河岸边的一片低洼肮脏的沼泽地上。","It was a dull, close, overcast summer evening.The clouds, which had been threatening all day, spread out in a dense and sluggish mass of vapour, already yielded large drops of rain, and seemed to presage a violent thunder-storm, when Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, turning out of the main street of the town, directed their course towards a scattered little colony of ruinous houses, distant from it some mile and a-half, or thereabouts, and erected on a low unwholesome swamp, bordering upon the river."
"他们俩都裹着破破烂烂的外套，这样一来可以挡雨，二来可以避人眼目，也许能一举两得。丈夫拿着个没亮光的灯笼，艰难地走在前头。路上很脏，他这样做似乎是想让身后的妻子可以踩着他深深的脚印前进。他们这样走着，一言不发。邦布尔先生时不时地放慢脚步，回过头去好像要确定他的贤内助是否跟得上，而看到她紧随其后，他就又调整好步伐，以相当快的速度，向他们的目的地走去。","They were both wrapped in old and shabby outer garments, which might, perhaps, serve the double purpose of protecting their persons from the rain, and sheltering them from observation.The husband carried a lantern, from which, however, no light yet shone; and trudged on, a few paces in front, as though—the way being dirty—to give his wife the benefit of treading in his heavy footprints.They went on, in profound silence; every now and then, Mr. Bumble relaxed his pace, and turned his head as if to make sure that his helpmate was following; then, discovering that she was close at his heels, he mended his rate of walking, and proceeded, at a considerable increase of speed, towards their place of destination."
"那地方远不止是一个名声不好的地方，因为人们很早就认识到，居住在那里的都是些底层的暴徒恶棍，他们打着各种各样的幌子，声称靠劳动吃饭，其实主要是靠抢劫和犯案过活。那里聚集了各样简陋肮脏的棚户：有一些是用松散的砖块匆匆垒成的，另一些是拿破旧的虫蛀船板搭成的。这些棚屋混杂在一起，完全没有试着合理规划，大部分就这么杵在距离河岸几英尺远的地方。几条拖上泥滩的破船被拴在岸边的矮墙上，到处都能看到一支桨或一卷缆绳散落在周围。一眼看上去，好像在这些破房子里住着的人都是在河上谋生的。不过，看到这些东西凌乱地散落着，毫无用处，过路人不费吹灰之力，就能推测出，这些东西丢在这里倒不是有人真的要用，只不过是保持原来的样子罢了。","This was far from being a place of doubtful character; for it had long been known as the residence of none but low ruffians, who, under various pretences of living by their labour, subsisted chiefly on plunder and crime.It was a collection of mere hovels: some, hastily built with loose bricks: others, of old worm-eaten ship-timber: jumbled together without any attempt at order or arrangement, and planted, for the most part, within a few feet of the river’s bank.A few leaky boats drawn up on the mud, and made fast to the dwarf wall which skirted it: and here and there an oar or coil of rope: appeared, at first, to indicate that the inhabitants of these miserable cottages pursued some avocation on the river;but a glance at the shattered and useless condition of the articles thus displayed, would have led a passer-by, without much difficulty, to the conjecture that they were disposed there, rather for the preservation of appearances, than with any view to their being actually employed."
"在这个棚户区的中心，紧靠河边，有一栋大房子，上面的几层楼都悬在水上。这个房子以前是当做生产某种产品的工厂用的。在工厂还运作的时候，它也许给住在附近廉价公寓里的居民们提供过工作机会。但是，它已经荒废很久了。老鼠、蛀虫，以及湿气的侵蚀已经使房子的木桩腐烂了，削弱了其支撑房子的力量。房子很大一部分都已经没入了水下，剩余的部分也在黑乎乎的水流上方摇摇欲坠、歪歪斜斜的，仿佛在等待一个合适的时机，步它那老伙伴的后尘，经历同样的命运。","In the heart of this cluster of huts; and skirting the river, which its upper stories overhung; stood a large building, formerly used as a manufactory of some kind.It had, in its day, probably furnished employment to the inhabitants of the surrounding tenements.But it had long since gone to ruin.The rat, the worm, and the action of the damp, had weakened and rotted the piles on which it stood; and a considerable portion of the building had already sunk down into the water; while the remainder, tottering and bending over the dark stream, seemed to wait a favourable opportunity of following its old companion, and involving itself in the same fate."
"正是在这座被严重损害的房子前，这对可敬的夫妇停下了脚步。这时，从远处传来了第一阵隆隆的雷声，在空中回荡，接着便下起了倾盆大雨。","It was before this ruinous building that the worthy couple paused, as the first peal of distant thunder reverberated in the air, and the rain commenced pouring violently down."
"“那地方肯定就在这附近。”邦布尔先生看了看手上拿着的纸片说道。","“The place should be somewhere here,” said Bumble, consulting a scrap of paper he held in his hand."
"“喂！”一个声音在上面喊道。","“Halloa there!” cried a voice from above."
"顺着声音，邦布尔先生抬起头，望见有个男人从三楼门口探出半个身子来看着他们。","Following the sound, Mr. Bumble raised his head and descried a man looking out of a door, breast-high, on the second story."
"“站着别动，等一分钟。”那声音叫道，“我马上就下来。”说着他把头缩了回去，门也关上了。","“Stand still, a minute,” cried the voice; “I’ll be with you directly.”With which the head disappeared, and the door closed."
"“是那个人吗？”邦布尔先生的贤内助问道。","“Is that the man?” asked Mr. Bumble’s good lady."
"邦布尔先生肯定地点了点头。","Mr. Bumble nodded in the affirmative."
"“那么，记住我和你说过的话。”女总管说，“能少说话就少说，不然你会立刻让我们露陷的。”","“Then, mind what I told you,” said the matron: “and be careful to say as little as you can, or you’ll betray us at once.”"
"邦布尔先生很是懊恼地看了看这座房子，很明显，他对继续深入这件事是否可行表现出一些疑惑。可是正在这时，他还没来得及发表见解，蒙克斯就出来了，他打开了他们身边的一扇小门，招呼他们进来。","Mr. Bumble, who had eyed the building with very rueful looks, was apparently about to express some doubts relative to the advisability of proceeding any further with the enterprise just then, when he was prevented by the appearance of Monks: who opened a small door, near which they stood, and beckoned them inwards."
"“进来吧！”他不耐烦地喊道，直跺脚。“别让我在这儿等着！”","“Come in!” he cried impatiently, stamping his foot upon the ground.“Don’t keep me here!”"
"女人先是迟疑了一下，然后不等他再招呼，就大胆地走了进去。邦布尔先生觉得惭愧，当然也没敢落在后面，紧跟着走了进去；显然他很不自在，平日性格里，那种最突出的、自命不凡的样子也几乎都看不见了。","The woman, who had hesitated at first, walked boldly in, without any other invitation.Mr. Bumble, who was ashamed or afraid to lag behind, followed: obviously very ill at ease and with scarcely any of that remarkable dignity which was usually his chief characteristic."
"“你搞什么鬼，刚才站在雨里干嘛呢？”蒙克斯闩上门，转过头来问邦布尔。","“What the devil made you stand lingering there, in the wet?” sadi Monks, turning round, and addressing Bumble, after he had bolted the door behind them."
"“我们——我们就是凉快会儿。”邦布尔一边结结巴巴地说，一边忧心重重地四下张望。","“We—we were only cooling ourselves,” stammered Bumble, looking apprehensively about him."
"“凉快会儿！”蒙克斯回嘴道，“那些已经下了的和将要下的雨全加起来也浇不灭一个人心里的欲望之火，正如浇不灭那地狱之火一样。你可没办法这么容易就让自己凉快下来，没门儿！”","“Cooling yourselves!” retorted Monks.“Not all the rain that ever fell, or ever will fall, will put as much of hell’s fire out, as a man can carry about with him.You won’t cool yourself so easily; don’t think it!”"
"这一段有趣的话结束后，蒙克斯猛地转向女总管，眼睛直盯着她，直到这位从不轻易屈服的女强人也不得不收回目光，看着地面。","With this agreeable speech, Monks turned short upon the matron, and bent his gaze upon her, till even she, who was not easily cowed, was fain to withdraw her eyes, and turn them towards the ground."
"“就是这女人，是吗？”蒙克斯问道。","“This is the woman, is it?” demanded Monks."
"“嗯！就是这女人。”邦布尔先生回答，不忘妻子对他的警告。","“Hem!That is the woman,” replied Mr. Bumble, mindful of his wife’s caution."
"“我猜，你认为没有女人能守得住秘密？”女总管插嘴道，边说边回敬蒙克斯锐利的目光。","“You think women never can keep secrets, I suppose?” said the matron, interposing, and returning, as she spoke, the searching look of Monks."
"“我知道女人们只能守得住一个秘密，直到被发现了为止。”蒙克斯说。","“I know they will always keep one till it’s  found out,” said Monks."
"“什么秘密？”女总管问道。","“And what may that be?” asked the matron."
"“就是她们失去了自己的好名声这样的秘密。”蒙克斯回答，“所以，同样地，如果一个女人卷入了一个会把她送上绞刑架，或者会被流放的秘密，我才不担心她会把这个秘密告诉别人呢，绝不担心！明白吗，夫人？”","“The loss of their own good name,” replied Monks.“So, by the same rule, if a woman’s a party to a secret that might hang or transport her, I’m not afraid of her telling it to anybody; not I!Do you understand, mistress?”"
"“不明白。”女总管答道，脸微微地发红。","“No,” rejoined the matron, slightly colouring as she spoke."
"“你当然不明白！”蒙克斯说，“你怎么会明白呢？”","“Of course you don’t!” said Monks.“How should you?”"
"那人对他这两位客人投去半笑半恼的表情，又招呼他们跟着他，就快步穿过这个空间相当宽敞但是屋顶很低的房间。他正准备爬上通往楼上仓库的陡峭的楼梯——或者不如说是梯子，一道明亮的闪电劈进屋子来，一声响雷紧随其后，这座破旧的房子摇晃起来。","Bestowing something half-way between a smile and a frown upon his two companions, and again beckoning them to follow him, the man hastened across the apartment, which was of considerable extent, but low in the roof.He was preparing to ascend a steep staircase, or rather ladder, leading to another floor of warehouses above: when a bright flash of lightning streamed down the aperture, and a peal of thunder followed, which shook the crazy building to its centre."
"“听见了吗！”他直往后退，大声说道，“听见了吗！轰轰隆隆就打进来了，就像在魔鬼藏身的上千个洞穴里回荡一样。我讨厌这声音！”","“Hear it!” he cried, shrinking back.“Hear it!Rolling and crashing on as if it echoed through a thousand caverns where the devils were hiding from it.I hate the sound!”"
"他沉默了一会儿，然后忽然将双手从脸上移开。他表情扭曲，面无血色，让邦布尔先生心里感到说不出的不安。","He remained silent for a few moments; and then, removing his hands suddenly from his face, showed, to the unspeakable discomposure of Mr. Bumble, that it was much distorted and discoloured."
"“我时不时地会像这样发作。”蒙克斯见到邦布尔惊慌的样子，说道，“有时听到雷声就会发作。现在不要管我，这次已经过去了。”","“These fits come over me, now and then,” said Monks, observing his alarm; “and thunder sometimes brings them on.Don’t mind me now; it’s all over for this once.”"
"他这么说着，带着两位爬上了梯子，然后急忙关上通往楼上的窗板。天花板的一根大梁上装着一个滑轮，滑轮的绳子末端吊着一盏灯，他把灯拉下来，幽暗的灯光照在下面放着的一张旧桌子和三把椅子上。","Thus speaking, he led the way up the ladder; and hastily closing the window-shutter of the room into which it led, lowered a lantern which hung at the end of a rope and pulley passed through one of the heavy beams in the ceiling: and which cast a dim light upon an old table and three chairs that were placed beneath it."
"“现在，”他们三个都坐下后，蒙克斯说，“我们越早进入正题，对大家越好。这女人知道要说什么，是不是？”","“Now,” said Monks, when they had all three seated themselves, “the sooner we come to our business, the better for all.The woman know what it is, does she?”"
"问题是冲着邦布尔提的，但是他的妻子抢着回答了，表示她完全清楚整件事情。","The question was addressed to Bumble; but his wife anticipated the reply, by intimating that she was perfectly acquainted with it."
"“他说你在那老太婆死的那天晚上和她在一起，她还跟你说了些事——”“关于你说的那个男孩的母亲。”女总管打断了他。“没错。”","“He is right in saying that you were with this hag the night she died; and that she told you something—” “About the mother of the boy you named,” replied the matron interrupting him.“Yes.”"
"“第一个问题，她说的事究竟是什么性质的？”蒙克斯说。","“The first question is, of what nature was her communication?” said Monks."
"“那是第二个问题。”女人格外谨慎地说，“第一个问题是，她说的事能值个什么价？”","“That’s the second,” observed the woman with much deliberation.“The first is, what may the communication be worth?”"
"“还不知道这是个什么样的事，鬼才知道？”蒙克斯问道。","“Who the devil can tell that, without knowing of what kind it is?” asked Monks."
"“我相信没人比你更清楚了。”邦布尔太太回答，她气势逼人，其同负一轭的夫君足以证明这一点。","“Nobody better than you, I am persuaded,” answered Mrs. Bumble: who did not want for spirit, as her yoke-fellow could abundantly testify."
"“哼！”蒙克斯脸上带着一种急切想要打听的神色，意味深长地说，“也许能值上几个钱吧，嗯？”","“Humph!” said Monks significantly, and with a look of eager inquiry; “there may be money’s worth to get, eh?”"
"“也许是吧。”回答的人很平静。","“Perhaps there may,” was the composed reply."
"“有一样东西从她身上拿走了。”蒙克斯说，“她以前戴在身上的。那件——”“赶紧出个价吧。”邦布尔太太打断了他，“我已经听够了，我相信我的确应该跟你说说这事。”","“Something that was taken from her,” said Monks.“Something that she wore.Something that—” “You had better bid,” interrupted Mrs. Bumble.“I have heard enough, already, to assure me that you are the man I ought to talk to.”"
"关于这个秘密，邦布尔先生知道的也就那么多。他以前从未获准从他另一半那里得到更多的消息。他这会儿不禁伸长了脖子、瞪大了眼睛留神听着。他的目光在他妻子和蒙克斯之间不停游移，面带无法掩饰的惊讶；当他听到后者严肃地问透露这个秘密要多少钱时，他更加吃惊了，如果之前还不算最惊讶的话。","Mr. Bumble, who had not yet been admitted by his better half into any greater share of the secret than he had originally possessed, listened to this dialogue with outstretched neck and distended eyes: which he directed towards his wife and Monks, by turns, in undisguised astonishment; increased, if possible, when the latter sternly demanded, what sum was required for the disclosure."
"“对你来说值多少？”女人问道，像之前一样镇定。","“What’s it worth to you?” asked the woman, as collected as before."
"“也许不值一分钱；也许值二十镑。”蒙克斯回答道，“说吧，让我瞧瞧到底值多少。”","“It may be nothing; it may be twenty pounds,” replied Monks.“Speak out, and let me know which.”"
"“照你说的价再加五镑，给我二十五个金镑，”女人说，“然后我就全告诉你。","“Add five pounds to the sum you have named; give me five-and-twenty pounds in gold,” said the woman; “and I’ll tell you all I know.Not before.”"
"“二十五镑！”蒙克斯叫道，向后退了一步。","“Five-and-twenty pounds!” exclaimed Monks, drawing back."
"“我说得够明白了，”邦布尔太太答道，“而且也不算是个大数目。”","“I spoke as plainly as I could,” replied Mrs. Bumble.“It’s not a large sum, either.”"
"“这种小秘密，也许说出来并没有什么价值，还不是个大数目！”蒙克斯不耐烦地大喊,“而且，这秘密已经埋藏了十二年了，或许时间还久！”","“Not a large sum for a paltry secret, that may be nothing when it’s told!” cried Monks impatiently;“and which has been lying dead for twelve years past or more!”"
"“这种事藏得越久越好，就像好酒一样，时间越久价值越翻倍。”女总管回答，脸上仍挂着那副坚决的、不在乎的表情。“至于藏在地下，埋了一万两千年的东西还有可能会再出来呢，或者埋了一千两百万年的，你我都知道，最终会有人出来讲些奇怪的事的！”","“Such matters keep well, and, like good wine, often double their value in course of time,” answered the matron, still preserving the resolute indifference she had assumed.“As to lying dead, there are those who will lie dead for twelve thousand years to come, or twelve million, for anything you or I know, who will tell strange tales at last!”"
"“要是我给了钱，得不到东西怎么办？”蒙克斯犹豫地问道。","“What if I pay it for nothing?” asked Monks, hesitating."
"“你可以轻而易举地再拿回去。”女总管说，“我只不过是个女人，一个人在这儿，也没人保护。”","“You can easily take it away again,” replied the matron.“I am but a woman; alone here; and unprotected.”"
"“你可不是一个人，亲爱的，也不是没人保护。”邦布尔先生因为害怕，颤颤巍巍地说道，“——我——我在这儿呢，亲爱的。而且，”邦布尔先生牙齿直打颤，说，“蒙克斯先生确实是个绅士，他是不会对教区人士动粗的。蒙克斯先生知道，我不年轻了，亲爱的，他也知道我身体不算结实，可以这么说。不过他听说过——我是说我相信蒙克斯先生听说过，亲爱的——要是惹怒了我，力气过人的我绝不会手软。只要稍微惹恼了我，我就会这样。”","“Not alone, my dear, nor unprotected, neither,” submitted Mr. Bumble, in a voice tremulous with fear: “—I—am here, my dear.And besides,” said Mr. Bumble, his teeth chattering as he spoke, “Mr. Monks is too much of a gentleman to attempt any violence on porochial persons.Mr. Monks is aware that I am not a young man, my dear, and also that I am a little run to seed, as I may say; but he has heerd: I say I have no doubt Mr. Monks has heerd, my dear: that I am a very determined officer, with very uncommon strength, if I’m once roused.I only want a little rousing; that’s all.”"
"邦布尔先生说着，手里紧紧地握着灯，装出一副恶狠狠的坚决的样子来，可惜处处又都表现出一副惊恐的表情。很明显，他的确需要给稍微惹恼一下，而且不仅仅是一下，才能做出这耀武扬威的姿态来。不过，若是对着贫民们，或者其他专门为着这个目的而接受训练的人们，就另当别论了。","As Mr. Bumble spoke, he made a melancholy feint of grasping his lantern with fierce determination; and plainly showed, by the alarmed expression of every feature, that he did want a little rousing, and not a little, prior to making any very warlike demonstration: unless, indeed, against paupers, or other person or persons trained down for the purpose."
"“你这个傻瓜。”邦布尔太太回答道，“最好赶紧给我闭嘴。”","“You are a fool,” said Mrs. Bumble, in reply; “and had better hold your tongue.”"
"“来之前，就应该把他舌头给割了，要是他不能小点儿声音说话。”蒙克斯冷冰冰地说，“那么！他是你丈夫，嗯？”","“He had better have cut it out, before he came, if he can’t speak in a lower tone,” said Monks, grimly.“So!He’s your husband, eh?”"
"“他，我丈夫！”女总管嗤笑着，并没有回答问题。","“He my husband!” tittered the matron, parrying the question."
"“你们一进来，我就是这么觉得的。”蒙克斯回答，注意到邦布尔太太在说话时，狠狠地瞪了一眼她的另一半。“那样就更好了，要是我发现跟我打交道的两个人是一个心思，我就能少点儿犹豫。我是认真的。看这儿！”","“I thought as much, when you came in,” rejoined Monks, marking the angry glance which the lady darted at her spouse as she spoke.“So much the better; I have less hesitation in dealing with two people, when I find that there’s only one will between them.I’m in earnest.See here!”"
"他把手伸进侧边口袋里，掏出个帆布袋子，数出二十五个金镑放在桌上，把它们全部推到女士面前。","He thrust his hand into a side-pocket; and producing a canvas bag, told out twenty-five sovereigns on the table, and pushed them over to the woman."
"“现在，”他说，“收起来吧，我觉得又要有雷声在屋顶炸开了，等它过去了，我再来听听你的故事吧。”","“Now,” he said, “gather them up; and when this cursed peal of thunder, which I feel is coming up to break over the house-top, is gone, let’s s hear your story.”"
"雷声听起来比上次更近了，几乎就在他们头顶上颤动着炸响。等雷声渐渐变小，蒙克斯从桌边抬起头，身子前倾，想要听听这女人要说些什么。两个男人都俯身在小小的桌子上，想要听个明白，女人也向前倾着身子，好让大家能听到她低声的说话，因此这三个人的脸几乎贴到一块儿去了。头上悬着的灯发出微弱的光芒，直照在他们身上，使他们的脸色愈发苍白和忧虑，映衬着身边无尽的黑暗，看起来十分恐怖。","The thunder, which seemed in fact much nearer, and to shiver and break almost over their heads, having subsided, Monks, raising his face from the table, bent forward to listen to what the woman should say.The faces of the three nearly touched, as the two men leant over the small table in their eagerness to hear, and the woman also leant forward to render her whisper audible.The sickly rays of the suspended lantern falling directly upon them, aggravated the paleness and anxiety of their countenances: which, encircled by the deepest gloom and darkness, looked ghastly in the extreme."
"“这个女人，我们都叫她老莎莉，她死的时候，”女总管开始了，“是和我单独在一起的。”","“When this woman, that we called old Sally, died,” the matron began, “she and I were alone.”"
"“旁边没别的人了吗？”蒙克斯用同样低沉的声音问道，“别的床上就没有可怜的病鬼或傻瓜？没有其他能听见，或者有可能听懂的人吗？”","“Was there no one by?” asked Monks, in the same hollow whisper;“No sick wretch or idiot in some other bed?No one who could hear, and might, by possibility, understand?”"
"“连个鬼影都没有。”女人回答道，“就我们俩。死神降临的时候，我——就我一个人站在她旁边。”","“Not a soul,” replied the woman; “we were alone.—I—stood alone beside the body when death came over it.”"
"“好。”蒙克斯全神贯注地看着她，说道，“继续。”","“Good,” said Monks, regarding her attentively.“Go on.”"
"“她提到了一位年轻人。”女总管接着说道，“那人前几年生了个孩子，不仅正是在那间屋子，还正是在她那时躺着的这张床上。”","“She spoke of a young creature,” resumed the matron, “who had brought a child into the world some years before; not merely in the same room, but in the same bed, in which she then lay dying.”"
"“啊？”蒙克斯说，嘴唇颤抖起来，回头看了一眼，“该死！怎么会这样！”","“Ay?” said Monks, with quivering lip, and glancing over his shoulder, “Blood!How things come about!”"
"“那孩子就是你昨晚跟他说起过的那个，”女总管说，不经意地朝她丈夫点了点头，“那护士偷了她母亲的东西。”","“The child was the one you named to him last night,” said the matron, nodding carelessly towards her husband; “the mother this nurse had robbed.”"
"“活着的时候？”蒙克斯问道。","“In life?” asked Monks."
"“死了以后。”女人仿佛打了个冷颤，回答道，“那个母亲快要断气的时候，曾经请求她把那东西留给孩子。可是她一死，老萨莉就把东西从死者身上偷走了。”","“In death,” replied the woman, with something like a shudder.“She stole from the corpse, when it had hardly turned to one, that which the dead mother had prayed her, with her last breath, to keep for the infant’s s sake.”"
"“她卖掉了那东西，”蒙克斯极度焦急地喊道，“她是不是把那东西给卖了？卖哪儿了？什么时候卖的？卖给谁了？多久以前卖的？”","“She sold it,” cried Monks, with desperate eagerness; “did she sell it?Where?When?To whom?How long before?”"
"“她费了很大的劲儿才说出来，她做了这件事，”女总管说，“然后就倒下死了。”","“As she told me, with great difficulty, that she had done this,” said the matron, “she fell back and died.”"
"“没多说一个字？”蒙克斯喊道，他尽量压低声音，但是倒显得更加愤怒了。“你说谎！我不会上当的。她肯定还说了其他话。我得知道她究竟还说了什么，要不然，我就要了你们俩的命。”","“Without saying more?” cried Monks, in a voice which, from its very suppression, seemed only the more furious.“It’s a lie!I’ll not be played with.She said more.I’ll tear the life out of you both, but I’ll know what it was.”"
"“她再没说什么话了，”女人说道，对这奇怪的人粗暴的举动无动于衷（邦布尔先生的表现就差得远了）；“不过她一只手紧紧地抓着我的袍子，并没有握紧。当我看到她死了，就使劲把她的手掰开，我发现她手里攥着一小片脏脏的纸条。”","“She didn’t utter another word,” said the woman, to all appearance unmoved (as Mr. Bumble was very far from being) by the strange man’s violence; “but she clutched my gown, violently, with one hand, which was partly closed; and when I saw that she was dead, and so removed the hand by force, I found it clasped a scrap of dirty paper.”"
"“上面写着什么——”蒙克斯的身子向前倾了倾，插嘴问。","“Which contained—” interposed Monks, stretching forward."
"“什么也没写。”女人答道，“那是张当票。”","“Nothing,” replied the woman; “it was a pawnbroker’s duplicate.”"
"“当什么的？”蒙克斯问道。","“For what?” demanded Monks."
"“到时候我自然会告诉你。”女人说。“我想她把这小东西藏了一段时间，希望能卖个好价钱；后来把它给当了，又攒钱，或者说是设法省钱，年复一年地支付当铺的利息，以免过期；那样，如果那东西以后能派上什么用场，还能再赎回来。不过到底没能派上什么用场，我告诉你，她手里拿着那张烂得不行了的小纸片，就死了。当时那张当票还有两天就过期了，我想也许哪天那东西真能派上点用场，就把它赎回来了。”","“In good time I’ll tell you.” said the woman.“I judge that she had kept the trinket, for some time, in the hope of turning it to better account; and then had pawned it; and had saved or scraped together money to pay the pawnbroker’s interest year by year, and prevent its running out; so that if anything came of it, it could still be redeemed.Nothing had come of it; and, as I tell you, she died with the scrap of paper, all worn and tattered, in her hand.The time was out in two days; I thought something might one day come of it too; and so redeemed the pledge.”"
"“那东西现在在哪儿？”蒙克斯急忙问道。","“Where is it now?” asked Monks quickly."
"“——在这儿——。”女人回答。她匆匆忙忙地将一个正好够装下一只法国表的小羊皮袋扔在桌上，好像很高兴终于摆脱了这东西。蒙克斯扑过去，双手颤抖地撕开袋子。袋子里装着一个金色的小盒子，盒子里面有两缕头发，还有一枚纯金的结婚戒指。","“—There—,” replied the woman.And, as if glad to be relieved of it, she hastily threw upon the table a small kid bag scarcely large enough for a French watch, which Monks pouncing upon, tore open with trembling hands.It contained a little gold locket: in which were two locks of hair, and a plain gold wedding-ring."
"“上面有字，里圈刻着‘阿格尼丝’几个字。”女人说道，","“It has the word ‘Agnes’ engraved on the inside,” said the woman."
"“还留出了空，用来填姓氏，后面还有日期，那是孩子出生前的一年。我查清楚了。”","“There is a blank left for the surname; and then follows the date; which is within a year before the child was born.I found out that.”"
"“就这些？”蒙克斯急切而又仔细地检查了小袋子里的东西之后说道。","“And this is all?” said Monks, after a close and eager scrutiny of the contents of the little packet."
"“就这些。”女人回答。","“All,” replied the woman."
"邦布尔先生长出了一口气，好像很高兴故事终于结束了，男人也没提出要收回那二十五个金镑。他鼓起勇气擦了擦鼻尖上的汗珠，在之前的对话中，他鼻子上不停地冒汗。","Mr. Bumble drew a long breath, as if he were glad to find that the story was over, and no mention made of taking the five-and-twenty pounds back again; and now he took courage to wipe the perspiration which had been trickling over his nose, unchecked, during the whole of the previous dialogue."
"“除了我能猜到的，我再也不知道什么了。”一阵短暂的沉默之后，女人对蒙克斯说，“我也不想知道，那样安全一点儿。但是我想问你两个问题，行吗？”","“I know nothing of the story, beyond what I can guess at,” said his wife addressing Monks, after a short silence; “and I want to know nothing; for it’s safer not.But I may ask you two questions, may I?”"
"“问吧。”蒙克斯略带惊讶地说，“不过，我回不回答就是另外的问题了。”","“You may ask,” said Monks, with some show of surprise; “but whether I answer or not is another question.”"
"“那就是三个问题了。”邦布尔先生说，想要卖弄一下自己在开玩笑方面的技巧。","“—Which makes three,” observed Mr. Bumble, essaying a stroke of facetiousness."
"“这就是你想要从我这里拿到的东西吗？”女总管问道。","“Is that what you expected to get from me?” demanded the matron."
"“正是。”蒙克斯回答，“另一个问题？”","“It is,” replied Monks.“The other question?”"
"“你想要拿它干什么？会不会对我不利？”","“What do you propose to do with it?Can it be used against me?”"
"“绝不会。”蒙克斯回答，“也不会对我不利。看这里！不过，别向前挪一步，不然你的命连根草都不值。”","“Never,” rejoined Monks; “nor against me either.See here!But don’t move a step forward, or your life is not worth a bulrush.”"
"他说着，忽然拉开桌子，抓住地板上的一个铁环，拉起一块大活板门，就在邦布尔先生脚边，吓得这位先生仓促地连退几步。","With these words, he suddenly wheeled the table aside, and pulling an iron ring in the boarding, threw back a large trap-door which opened close at Mr. Bumble’s feet, and caused that gentleman to retire several paces backward, with great precipitation."
"“往下看。”蒙克斯说，并把灯放低朝洞里晃去。“别害怕。要是我有这打算，你们刚坐在这儿的时候，我就可以悄无声息地让你们都下去。”","“Look down,” said Monks, lowering the lantern into the gulf.“Don’t fear me.I could have let you down, quietly enough, when you were seated over it, if that had been my game.”"
"女总管受到鼓励，走到洞边去，甚至邦布尔先生自己也在好奇心的驱使下，做出同样的举动。大雨过后，浑浊的河水暴涨，从下面奔腾而过，冲击着沾满泥巴的绿色木桩，浪花四溅，一切声音都隐没在喧哗的水声中。这下面以前有个水磨，泛起泡沫的浪头打在几根腐烂了的柱子和残留的机器零部件上。摆脱了这些徒劳无功的、企图阻止水流奔涌前进的障碍物，浪潮似乎又有了新的动力，一路向前奔去。","Thus encouraged, the matron drew near to the brink; and even Mr. Bumble himself, impelled by curiousity, ventured to do the same.The turbid water, swollen by the heavy rain, was rushing rapidly on below; and all other sounds were lost in the noise of its plashing and eddying against the green and slimy piles.There had once been a water-mill beneath; the tide foaming and chafing round the few rotten stakes, and fragments of machinery that yet remained, seemed to dart onward, with a new impulse, when freed from the obstacles which had unavailingly attempted to stem its headlong course."
"“如果把一个人的尸体扔在这下面，明天早上会在哪儿？”蒙克斯说着，将吊灯在黑压压的井里来来回回地摇动。","“If you flung a man’s body down there, where would it be to-morrow morning?” said Monks, swinging the latern to and fro in the dark well."
"“顺着这条河十二英里外的地方，而且已经被切成碎片了。”邦布尔先生说，想到这一点，他不禁往后退缩。","“Twelve miles down the river, and cut to pieces besides,” replied Bumble, recoiling at the thought."
"蒙克斯从怀里掏出刚刚匆忙塞进去的那个小袋子，绑上个铅块，那铅块是从滑轮上掉在地板上，然后他把口袋扔进水流里。它笔直地掉了下去，划开水面，几乎听不见声响，然后就不见了。","Monks drew the little packet from his breast, where he had hurriedly thrust it; and tying it to a leaden weight, which had formed a part of some pulley, and was lying on the floor, dropped it into the stream.It fell straight, and true as a die; clove the water with a scarcely audible splash; and was gone."
"这三人面面相觑，似乎都松了口气。","The three looking into each other’s faces, seemed to breathe more freely."
"“喂！”蒙克斯说着，关上了活板门，门板重重地落回原来的位置。“要是大海能把死了的人送到岸上，就像书上说的那样，它也会把金银财宝留给自己的，还有那个没用的垃圾。我们也没什么好谈的了，这次愉快的见面不如就到此为止吧。”","“There!” siad Monks, closing the trap-door, which fell heavily back into its former position.“If the sea ever gives up its dead, as books say it will, it will keep its gold and silver to itself, and that trash among it.We have nothing more to say, and may break up our pleasant party.”"
"“当然可以。”邦布尔先生说道，欣然接受这样的提议。","“By all means,” observed Mr. Bumble, with great alacrity."
"“你会对这件事守口如瓶，对吧？”蒙克斯带着威胁的表情说，“我可不担心你老婆。”","“You’ll keep a quiet tongue in your head, will you?” said Monks, with a threatening look.“I am not afraid of your wife.”"
"“你完全可以信任我，年轻人。”邦布尔先生一边回答，一边弓着身子慢慢地朝梯子退去，客气得有点儿过分。“那是为了每个人好，年轻人，也是为了我自己，你知道的，蒙克斯先生。”","“You may depend upon me, young man,” answered Mr. Bumble, bowing himself gradually towards the ladder, with excessive politeness.“On everybody’s account, young man; on my own, you know, Mr. Monks.”"
"“看在你的份上，我很高兴听到你这么说。”蒙克斯先生说，“把灯点亮！赶紧离开这儿。”","“I am glad, for your sake, to hear it,” remarked Monks.“Light your lantern!And get away from here as fast as you can.”"
"在这个时候结束对话，对邦布尔先生来说还是很幸运的，要不然他准得一头栽到下面的房间里，因为他已经弓着身子退到离梯子不足六英寸的地方了。蒙克斯从绳子上解下灯来，邦布尔先生就借火点亮了自己手里的灯，没再多说什么，沉默地下楼去了。他的妻子跟在身后。蒙克斯在梯子上停下来，直到确定除了屋外的雨声和水流的声音之外再听不到别的声音了，他才最后一个走下来。","It was fortunate that the conversation terminated at this point, or Mr. Bumble, who had bowed himself to within six inches of the ladder, would infallibly have pitched headlong into the room below.He lighted his lantern from that which Monks had detached from the rope, and now carried in his hand; and making no effort to prolong the discourse, descended in silence, followed by his wife.Monks brought up the rear, after pausing on the steps to satisfy himself that there were no other sounds to be heard than the beating of the rain without, and the rushing of the water."
"他们慢慢地穿过楼下的房间，小心翼翼地走着，因为每一个影子都能让蒙克斯吃惊不已；邦布尔先生提着的灯离地一英尺高，步伐格外谨慎，对于他这种体型的人来说，这样轻快的步子算是了不起了。他还紧张地四处张望，怕再有什么隐藏着的活板门。蒙克斯轻轻地拿掉门闩，打开他们进来时的那扇门。这对夫妇只是跟他们这位神秘的朋友点了点头，就走向门外黑暗的雨夜里去了。","They traversed the lower room, slowly, and with caution; for Monks started at every shadow; and Mr. Bumble, holding his lantern a foot above the ground, walked not only with remarkable care, but with a marvellously light step for a gentleman of his figure: looking nervously about him for hidden trap-doors.The gate at which they had entered, was softly unfastened and opened by Monks; merely exchanging a nod with their mysterious acquaintance, the married couple emerged into the wet and darkness outside."
"他们刚走，蒙克斯似乎就对单独呆在这里感到一种抑制不住的恶心。于是，他把一个一直藏在楼下某个地方的男孩叫了出来。蒙克斯让他提着灯走在前面，又回到了他刚刚离开的那个房间里。","They were no sooner gone, than Monks, who appeared to entertain an invincible repugnance to being left alone, called to a boy who had been hidden somewhere below.Bidding him go first, and bear the light, he returned to the chamber he had just quitted."
"第三十九章 介绍几位值得尊敬的人物，都是读者已经熟知的人了；看看蒙克斯和老犹太人是怎样顶着颇有价值的脑袋聚在一起的","CHAPTER XXXIX Introduces some respectable characters with whom the reader is already acquainted, and shows how Monks and the Jew laid their worthy heads together "
"上一章里提到，那三位大人物在那晚做成了一笔小小的生意。第二天晚上，威廉·赛克斯先生小憩后醒来，睡眼惺忪，咆哮着问现在是晚上几点了。","On the evening following that upon which the three worthies mentioned in the last chapter, disposed of their little matter of business as therein narrated, Mr. William Sikes, awakening from a nap, drowsily growled forth an inquiry what time of night it was."
"赛克斯先生提出这个问题时所在的房间，并不是以前他来彻特西时，住过的那一间，尽管是同在小镇上的一个城区，而且跟他以前的住处相距不远。这个地方从表面看来不如他的旧居那样令人满意；设施简陋，破败不堪，面积也很有限，只在屋顶上开了一个小窗采光，而且屋子毗邻一条狭窄肮脏的小巷。这位绅士近来运气非常不好，这一点已不需要再多做说明，住处缺少家具，全无舒适可言，甚至像换洗衣物这样琐碎的财产都没有，这一切无不表现出一种极度贫困的境况。如果这些迹象还有待确认的话，那赛克斯先生本人皮包骨头的样子也能给予充分的证明。","The room in which Mr. Sikes propounded this question, was not one of those he had tenanted, previous to the Chertsey expedition, although it was in the same quarter of the town, and was situated at no great distance from his former lodgings.It was not, in appearance, so desirable a habitation as his old quarters: being a mean and badly-furnished apartment, of very limited size; lighted only by one small window in the shelving roof, and abutting on a close and dirty lane.Nor were there wanting other indications of the good gentleman’s having gone down in the world of late: for a great scarcity of furniture, and total absence of comfort, toget her with the disappearance of all such small moveables as spare clothes and linen, bespoke a state of extreme poverty;while the meagre and attenuated condition of Mr. Sikes himself would have fully confirmed these symptoms, if they had stood in any need of corroboration."
"这个强盗正躺在床上，身上裹着他那件白色的大外套，当作睡衣穿着；他的脸上露出如死尸般的病容，加上肮脏的睡帽，以及一周都没刮过的、又黑又硬的胡子，这一切表明他的形象一点儿都没得到改进。那条狗趴在床边，不时用愁闷的眼神瞧瞧自己的主人；当听到街上或者楼下传来什么声音，它就竖起耳朵，发出一声低沉的吠声。一个女人坐在窗边，正忙着补一件旧背心，那是强盗平常穿的。因为要照顾病人，加上生活贫困，她脸色苍白，十分瘦弱，如果不是听到她回答赛克斯先生的声音，很难认出她就是前文里提到过的那个南希。","The housebreaker was lying on the bed, wrapped in his white great-coat, by way of dressing-gown, and displaying a set of features in no degree improved by the cadaverous hue of illness, and the addition of a soiled nightcap, and a stiff, black beard of a week’s growth.The dog sat at the bedside: now eyeing his master with a wistful look, and now pricking his ears, and uttering a low growl as some noise in the street, or in the lower part of the house, attracted his attention.Seated by the window, busily engaged in patching an old waistcoat which formed a portion of the robber’s ordinary dress, was a female: so pale and reduced with watching and privation, that there would have been considerable difficulty in recognising her as the same Nancy who has already figured in this tale, but for the voice in which she replied to Mr. Sikes’s question."
"“刚过七点。”姑娘回答，“你今晚觉得怎么样，比尔？”","“Not long gone seven,” said the girl.“How do you feel to-night, Bill?”"
"“弱得像水一样。”赛克斯先生回答道，对着自己的眼睛和手脚咒骂了一声。“过来，帮我一把，让我从这该死的床上下来。”","“As weak as water,” replied Mr. Sikes, with an imprecation on his eyes and limbs.“Here; lend us a hand, and let me get off this thundering bed anyhow.”"
"病痛并没能让赛克斯先生的脾气有所收敛，姑娘扶他起身，朝一把椅子走去，他一直骂骂咧咧着，说她笨手笨脚，还打了她。","Illness had not improved Mr. Sikes’s temper; for, as the girl raised him up and led him to a chair, he muttered various curses on her awkwardness, and struck her."
"“你哭了？”赛克斯说，“过来！别站在那儿哭哭啼啼的。你要是除了哭，什么都不干的话，还不如赶紧滚蛋。听到我的话了吗？”","“Whining are you?” said Sikes.“Come! Don’t stand snivelling there.If you can’t do anything better than that, cut off altogether.D’ye hear me?”"
"“听到了。”姑娘回答道，转过脸去，强挤出一丝笑容。“你这会儿又在想什么呢？”","“I hear you,” replied the girl, turning her face aside, and forcing a laugh.“What fancy have you got in your head now?”"
"“哦！你改变主意了，是吗？”赛克斯看到泪水在她眼眶里打转，低声咆哮道，“你想通了，这对你有好处。”","“Oh! you’ve  thought better of it, have you?” growled Sikes, marking the tear which trembled in her eye.“All the better for you, you have.”"
"“哎，你今晚不是故意想对我这么凶的吧，比尔。”姑娘一只手放在他肩膀上，说道。","“Why, you don’t mean to say, you’d be hard upon me to-night, Bill,” said the girl, laying her hand upon his shoulder."
"“不是？”赛克斯先生叫道，“为什么不是？”","“No!” cried Mr. Sikes.“Why not?”"
"“这么多个晚上，”姑娘带着一丝女性的温柔说道，连声音都变得悦耳甜美。“这么多个晚上，我悉心照顾你，看护你，把你当作孩子似的。今晚还是我第一次看到你又变成老样子，你要是想到了那一点，就不会像刚才那样对我了吧，是不是？快说，快说，说你不会。”","“Such a number of nights,” said the girl, with a touch of woman’s tenderness, which communicated something like sweetness of tone, even to her voice:“such a number of nights as I’ve  been patient with you, nursing and caring for you, as if you had been a child: and this the first that I’ve  seen you like yourself; you wouldn’t have served me as you did just now, if you’d thought of that, would you?Come, come; say you wouldn’t.”"
"“那么，好吧，”赛克斯先生说道，“我不会。哎，天哪，为什么这女人又哭起来了！”","“Well, then,” rejoined Mr. Sikes, “I wouldn’t.Why, damme, now, the girls’s whining again!”"
"“没事。”姑娘说着，自己坐到一把椅子上。“你别管我。一会儿我就没事了。”","“It’s nothing,” said the girl, throwing herself into a chair.“Don’t you seem to mind me. it’s s ll soon be over.”"
"“什么没事了？”赛克斯先生凶巴巴地问道，“现在，你又在犯什么傻呢？起来，干活去，别再拿你们女人的傻话来烦我。”","“What’s ll be over?” demanded Mr. Sikes in a savage voice.“What foolery are you up to, now, again?Get up and bustle about, and don’t come over me with your woman’s nonsense.”"
"在其他任何时候，这种告诫及说话的腔调都能够达到预期效果，但是这会儿，姑娘实在是太虚弱了，她已经精疲力竭了。赛克斯先生还想再说上几句在此类情况下应该说的恶语，习惯性地给他的告诫加点儿装饰，不过话还没来得及出口，姑娘的头就向椅背后一仰，晕了过去。在这种紧急情况下，赛克斯先生完全不知道应该怎么办才好，因为南希小姐的歇斯底里症一发作就十分猛烈，只能靠病人自己的拼命挣扎才能得到解脱，外人帮不上什么忙；赛克斯先生试了试咒骂几句，发现这方法完全没有效果，只好叫人来帮忙。","At any other time, this remonstrance, and the tone in which it was delivered, would have had the desired effect; but the girl being really weak and exhausted, dropped her head over the back of the chair, and fainted, before Mr. Sikes could get out a few of the appropriate oaths with which, on similar occasions, he was accustomed to garnish his threats.Not knowing, very well, what to do, in this uncommon emergency; for Miss Nancy’s hysterics were usually of that violent kind which the patient fights and struggles out of, without much assistance; Mr. Sikes tried a little blasphemy: and finding that mode of treatment wholly ineffectual, called for assistance."
"“这里怎么啦，亲爱的？”费金朝屋里看了看，问道。","“What’s the matter here, my dear?” said Fagin, looking in."
"“来帮帮这姑娘，行不行？”赛克斯不耐烦地说，“别光站在那儿看热闹，还嘻皮笑脸的！”","“Lend a hand to the girl, can’t you?” replied Sikes impatiently.“Don’t stand chattering and grinning at me!”"
"费金发出一声惊叹，赶紧上前帮忙。而约翰·道金斯先生（也就是机灵鬼）跟着他那位德高望重的朋友进了屋，赶忙把背着的东西放在地板上。然后他从紧跟着他走进来的查尔斯·贝茨少爷手里一把抓过瓶子，一眨眼就用牙把它咬开了。他先自己尝了点儿，以免弄错，然后把里面的东西往病人的喉咙里灌了些。","With an exclamation of surprise, Fagin hastened to the girl’s assistance, while Mr. John Dawkins (otherwise the Artful Dodger), who had followed his venerable friend into the room, hastily deposited on the floor a bundle with which he was laden;and snatching a bottle from the grasp of Master Charles Bates who came close at his heels, uncorked it in a twinkling with his teeth, and poured a portion of its contents down the patient’s s throat: previously taking a taste, himself, to prevent mistakes."
"“用风箱让她吸几口新鲜空气，查理，”道金斯先生说，“比尔解开她衬裙时，你就拍拍她的手，费金。”","“Give her a whiff of fresh air with the bellows, Charley,” said Mr. Dawkins; “and you slap her hands, Fagin, while Bill undoes the petticuts.”"
"大家齐心协力，起劲地做急救工作，特别是贝茨少爷的那部分，他似乎觉得自己在抢救工作里的行为是一种前所未有的乐趣。不一会儿，救助就产生了令人满意的效果。姑娘逐渐恢复过来，踉踉跄跄地走向床边的一把椅子，把脸埋在枕头里，留下赛克斯先生自己对付这群客人，他们不请自来让赛克斯颇感意外。","These united restoratives, administered with great energy: especially that department consigned to Master Bates, who appeared to consider his share in the proceedings, a piece of unexampled pleasantry: were not long in producing the desired effect.The girl gradually recovered her senses; and, staggering to a chair by the bedside, hid her face upon the pillow: leaving Mr. Sikes to confront the new comers, in some astonishment at their unlooked—for appearance."
"“哎，什么鬼风把你们给吹来了？”他问费金。","“Why, what evil wind has blowed you here?” he asked Fagin."
"“没什么鬼风，亲爱的，鬼风不能给人带来任何好处，而我带了些好东西来，你见了一定会很高兴的。机灵鬼，亲爱的，打开那个包裹，把那些小东西拿给比尔，今天早上我们花光了所有的钱才买到的那些东西。”","“No evil wind at all, my dear, for evil winds blow nobody any good; and I’ve  brought something good with me, that you’ll be glad to see.Dodger, my dear, open the bundle; and give Bill the little trifles that we spent all our money on, this morning.”"
"机灵鬼听到费金先生吩咐，便解开包裹。包裹很大，用一块旧桌布包着。机灵鬼把里面的东西一件件拿出来递给查理·贝茨，后者一边把东西放在桌上，一边对东西的珍贵精美赞不绝口。","In compliance with Mr. Fagin’s request, the Artful untied this bundle, which was of large size, and formed of an old table-cloth; and handed the articles it contained, one by one, to Charley Bates: who placed them on the table, with various encomiums on their rarity and excellence."
"“多棒的兔肉馅饼，比尔，”这位年轻的绅士说着，拿出了一大块馅饼来，“多棒的东西，多嫩的腿肉，比尔，连骨头都会在你嘴里化了呢，都用不着剔出来。半磅绿茶，七先令六便士一磅，特别浓，要是你用开水一泡，可能会把茶壶盖也给掀飞了呢；一磅半的糖，有些潮了，肯定是那群黑鬼又偷懒了，以前他们把这弄得可好了——哦，不！两个两磅重的大面包，一磅最好的鲜肉，一块双料格罗斯特奶酪，最后，还有你喝过的最名贵的酒！”","“Sitch a rabbit pie, Bill,” exclaimed that young gentleman, disclosing to view a huge pasty; “sitch delicate creeturs, with sitch tender limbs, Bill, that the wery bones melt in your mouth, and there’s no occasion to pick ’em;half a pound of seven and six-penny green, so precious strong that if you mix it with biling water, it’s s ll go nigh to blow the lid of the tea-pot off; a pound and a half of moist sugar that the niggers didn’t work at all at, afore they got it up to sitch a pitch of goodness,—oh no!Two half-quartern brans; pound of best fresh; piece of double Glo’ster; and, to wind up all, some of the richest sort you ever lushed!”"
"说完最后这句赞词，贝茨少爷从他的大口袋里掏出一整瓶还没开封的酒来。这时，道金斯先生也从他带来的瓶子里倒出一杯烈酒，病人毫不迟疑地灌了下去。","Uttering this last panegyric, Master Bates produced, from one of his extensive pockets, a full-sized wine-bottle, carefully corked; while Mr. Dawkins, at the same instant, poured out a wine-glassful of raw spirits from the bottle he carried: which the invalid tossed down his throat without a moment’s s hesitation."
"“啊！”费金相当满意地搓搓手，说道，“你行的，比尔，你现在可以的。”","“Ah!” said Fagin, rubbing his hands with great satisfaction.“You’ll do, Bill; you’ll do now.”"
"“行！”赛克斯先生喊道，“在你们帮上任何忙之前，我怕是已经不行二十回了。你们是什么意思？竟忍心抛下一个这样的病人三个多星期？这群没良心的混蛋？”","“Do!” exclaimed Mr. Sikes;“I might have been done for, twenty times over, afore you’d have done anything to help me.What do you mean by leaving a man in this state, three weeks and more, you false-hearted wagabond?”"
"“听听他说的，孩子们！”费金耸耸肩说，“我们还给他带来这么些好——东——西。”","“Only hear him, boys!” said Fagin, shrugging his shoulders.“And us come to bring him all these beau-ti-ful things.”"
"“东西倒是很好，”赛克斯先生说道，他扫了一眼桌上的东西，稍微觉得有点儿顺心，“但是你们自己准备怎么辩解？为什么把我留在这儿，吃不好，又生着病，混混沌沌的，什么都没有，这么长时间你们还不管我，还不如一只狗。——把他赶下去，查理！”","“The things is well enough in their way,” observed Mr. Sikes: a little soothed as he glanced over the table; “but what have you got to say for yourself, why you should leave me here, down in the mouth, health, blunt, and everything else; and take no more notice of me, all this mortal time, than if I was that’ere dog.—Drive him down, Charley!”"
"“我还从没见过这么有意思的狗。”贝茨少爷一边把狗赶跑，一边大声说道，“就像要去市场的老太太一样，总能闻到食物的味道！要是上了舞台，它准能成名，还能复兴戏剧呢。”","“I never see such a jolly dog as that,” cried Master Bates, doing as he was desired.“Smelling the grub like a old lady a going to market!He’d make his fortun on the stage that dog would, and rewive the drayma besides.”"
"“别吵了。”赛克斯喊道。那狗退到床下，仍然低声怒吼着。“你们准备怎么辩解呢，你们这些没用的老贼头，嗯？”","“Hold your din,” cried Sikes, as the dog retreated under the bed: still growling angrily.“What have you got to say for yourself, you withered old fence, eh?”"
"“我有一个多星期不在伦敦，亲爱的，办事去了。”犹太人答道。","“I was away from London, a week and more, my dear, on a plant,” replied the Jew."
"“那么另外两周怎么解释？”赛克斯追问道，“怎么解释另外两周，你把我丢在这里，像只生病的老鼠似的躺在洞里？”","“And what about the other fortnight?” demanded Sikes.“What about the other fortnight that you’ve left me lying here, like a sick rat in his hole?”"
"“我没办法啊，比尔。当着别人的面，我没法解释清楚；不过我真的是没办法，我拿名誉担保。”","“I couldn’t help it, Bill.I can’t go into a long explanation before company; but I couldn’t help it, upon my honour.”"
"“拿什么？”赛克斯露出极度厌恶的神情，吼道，“喂！你们谁给我切块馅饼，去去嘴里的味儿，他这话简直要让我窒息了。”","“Upon your what?” growled Sikes, with excessive disgust. “Here!Cut me off a piece of that pie, one of you boys, to take the taste of that out of my mouth, or it’s s ll choke me dead.”"
"“别发脾气，亲爱的。”费金恭恭敬敬地劝道，“我从来都没忘了你啊，比尔，一次也没有。”","“Don’t be out of temper, my dear,” urged Fagin, submissively.“I have never forgot you, Bill; never once.”"
"“没有！我谅你也不敢。”赛克斯说道，苦笑了一下。“我躺在这里，浑身发烫，抖个不停，你却时刻在谋划算计着，让比尔做这个，或者做那个；只要他一好，什么都让比尔来做，真是廉价的劳力，比尔又穷得可以，正好来给你做事。要不是这姑娘，我也许早就死了。”","“No!I’ll pound it that you han’t,” replied Sikes, with a bitter grin.“You’ve  been scheming and plotting away, every hour that I have laid shivering and burning here; and Bill was to do this; and Bill was to do that; and Bill was to do it all, dirt cheap, as soon as he got well: and was quite poor enough for your work.If it hadn’t been for the girl, I might have died.”"
"“比尔，你看。”费金赶紧接过话来，抱怨道，“要不是这姑娘！除了可怜的老费金，谁还能给你找个这样的姑娘围着你转？”","“There now, Bill,” remonstrated Fagin, eagerly catching at the word.“If it hadn’t been for the girl!Who but poor ould Fagin was the means of your having such a handy girl about you?”"
"“这话他可说对了！”南希连忙走上前说，“随他去吧。随他去吧。”","“He says true enough there!” siad Nancy, coming hastily forward.“Let him be; let him be.”"
"南希一出现，谈话就转了方向；谨慎的老犹太人给那两个小伙子使了个狡猾的眼色，他们便开始一个劲儿地给她敬酒。不过，她喝得很少；费金这会儿却装出一副特别高兴的样子，慢慢哄得赛克斯先生收了脾气。费金把他的威胁只当作善意的玩笑。而且，赛克斯先生一个劲儿地喝酒，也撂下脸来讲一两个粗俗的笑话，费金开怀大笑。","Nancy’s appearance gave a new turn to the conversation; for the boys, receiving a sly wink from the wary old Jew, began to ply her with liquor:of which, however, she took very sparingly; while Fagin, assuming an unusual flow of spirits, gradually brought Mr. Sikes into a better temper, by affecting to regard his threats as a little pleasant banter; and, moreover, by laughing very heartily at one or two rough jokes, which, after repeated applications to the spirit-bottle, he condescended to make."
"“这倒是不错。”赛克斯先生说，“不过今晚你得给我些钱。”","“It’s all very well,” said Mr. Sikes; “but I must have some blunt from you to-night.”"
"“我身上一个硬币也没有了。”犹太人答道。","“I haven’t a piece of coin about me,” replied the Jew."
"“你家里肯定有很多钱，”赛克斯反驳说，“我得从那儿拿点儿来。”","“Then you’ve  got lots at home,” retorted Sikes; “and I must have some from there.”"
"“很多钱！”费金叫道，举起双手。“我的钱还没多到——”“我不知道你有多少钱，我敢说你自己也不知道，因为要数清楚可得花会儿功夫呢。”赛克斯说，“不过我今晚非得拿到一些，就这样。”","“Lots!” cried Fagin, holding up his hands.“I haven’t so much as would—” “I don’t know how much you’ve  got, and I dare say you hardly know yourself, as it would take a pretty long time to count it,” said Sikes; “but I must have some to-night; and that’s flat.”"
"“好吧，好吧。”费金叹了口气，说道，“我一会儿让机灵鬼给你送来。”","“Well, well,” said Fagin, with a sigh, “I’ll send the Artful round presently.”"
"“你可不会做这种事的。”赛克斯先生回嘴道，“机灵鬼可太机灵了，准会忘了送来，或者迷路了，要不就是遇上警察来不了了，总之只要你发话，他一定有个借口。南希会到你窝里去拿，确保一切顺利；她走了，我就躺下睡一会儿。”","“You won’t do nothing of the kind,” rejoined Mr. Sikes.“The Artful’s a deal too artful, and would forget to come, or lose his way, or get dodged by traps and so be perwented, or anything for an excuse, if you put him up to it.Nancy shall go to the ken and fetch it, to make all sure; and I’ll lie down and have a snooze while she’s gone.”"
"费金讨价还价了好一会儿，才把要求的总数从五镑降到了三镑四先令六便士，还郑重其事地抱怨说，这样他只剩下十八个便士度日了；赛克斯先生不高兴地说，要是他弄不来更多的钱，自己就要跟他一起到家里去；这空当，机灵鬼和贝茨少爷把吃的东西都放进橱柜里了。于是，犹太人跟他亲爱的朋友道别，与两个小伙子和南希一块儿走了；赛克斯先生一头倒在床上，安安稳稳地睡了很长时间，等着姑娘回来。","After a great deal of haggling and squabbling, Fagin beat down the amount of the required advance from five pounds to three pounds four and sixpence: protesting with many solemn asseverations that that would only leave him eighteen-pence to keep house with; Mr. Sikes sullenly remarking that if he couldn’t get any more he must accompany him home; with the Dodger and Master Bates put the eatables in the cupboard.The Jew then, taking leave of his affectionate friend, returned homeward, attended by Nancy and the boys: Mr. Sikes, meanwhile, flinging himself on the bed, and composing himself to sleep away the time until the young lady’s return."
"之后，他们顺利抵达费金的住处，发现托比·格拉基特和基特宁先生正专注地玩着第十五局纸牌。不用说，又是后面这位绅士输了，而且输掉了他第十五个也是最后一个便士，这让他年轻的朋友们觉得很有意思。拿这么一位状态和智力都远不如自己的绅士寻开心，格拉基特先生显然觉得很不好意思，于是他打着哈欠，问了问赛克斯的情况，就拿上帽子准备离开。","In due course, they arrived at Fagin’s abode, where they found Toby Crackit and Mr. Chitling intent upon their fifteenth game at cribbage, which it is scarcely necessary to say the latter gentleman lost, and with it, his fifteenth and last sixpence: much to the amusement of his young friends.Mr. Crackit, apparently somewhat ashamed at being found relaxing himself with a gentleman so much his inferior in station and mental endowments, yawned, and inquiring after Sikes, took up his hat to go."
"“有人来过吗，托比？”费金问。","“Has nobody been, Toby?” asked Fagin."
"“腿都没一条。”格拉基特先生拉了拉领子回答道，“就像喝剩的啤酒一样没劲。你该给我点儿好东西，费金，作为我看家这么久的报酬。见鬼，我像个陪审员一样无聊，要不是我好心给这个年轻人解解闷，我早该睡觉去了，跟在监狱里一样。真是太无聊了，不无聊才怪呢！”","“Not a living leg,” answered Mr. Crackit, pulling up his collar; “it’s been as dull as swipes.You ought to stand something handsome, Fagin, to recompense me for keeping house so long.Damme, I’m as flat as a juryman; and should have gone to sleep, as fast as Newgate, if I hadn’t had the good natur’ to amuse this youngster.Horrid dull, I’m blessed if I an’t!”"
"托比·格拉基特先生一边发着同样的牢骚，一边神气地把赢的一些小钱拢在一起，放进背心口袋里，好像这点儿小银币根本不入他这位先生的法眼。收好了钱，他摇摇晃晃地走出屋子，彬彬有礼，风度翩翩，基特宁先生不禁频频朝他穿着靴子的双腿投以羡慕的目光，直到看不见为止。他向众人保证道，花十五个六便士银币认识这么个人实在是太便宜了，他根本不介意像弹弹小手指一样输掉的那点儿钱。","With these and other ejaculations of the same kind, Mr. Toby Crackit swept up his winnings, and crammed them into his waistcoat pocket with a haughty air, as though such small pieces of silver were wholly beneath the consideration of a man of his figure;this done, he swaggered out of the room, with so much elegance and gentility, that Mr. Chitling, bestowing numerous admiring glances on his legs and boots till they were out of sight, assured the company that he considered his acquaintance cheap at fifteen sixpences an interview, and that he didn’t value his losses the snap of his little finger."
"“你真是个怪人，汤姆！”贝茨少爷说，他觉得这番话很有意思。","“Wot a rum chap you are, Tom!” siad Master Bates, highly amused by this declaration."
"“一点儿也不是。”基特宁先生回答道，“我怪吗，费金？”","“Not a bit of it,” replied Mr. Chitling.“Am I, Fagin?”"
"“你很聪明，亲爱的。”费金拍了拍他的肩膀说，一边对其他的跟班使眼色。","“A very clever fellow, my dear,” said Fagin, patting him on the shoulder, and winking to his other pupils."
"“格拉基特先生真是一位名流，不是吗，费金？”汤姆问道。","“And Mr. Crackit is a heavy swell; an’t he, Fagin?” asked Tom."
"“毫无疑问，亲爱的。”","“No doubt at all of that, my dear.”"
"“能认识他可真是件体面的事情，是不是，费金？”汤姆追问道。","“And it is a creditable thing to have his acquaintance; an’t it, Fagin?” pursued Tom."
"“可不是嘛，的确是，亲爱的。他们只是嫉妒你，汤姆，因为他们没能认识他。”","“Very much so, indeed, my dear.They’re only jealous, Tom, because he won’t give it to them.”"
"“啊！”汤姆得意地叫道，“就是这个原因了！他赢走了我所有的钱。不过，我想要的时候可以去赚更多的钱，对吧，费金？”","“Ah!” cried Tom, triumphantly, “that’s where it is!”He has cleaned me out.But I can go and earn some more, when I like; can’t I, Fagin?”"
"“你当然行，越早去越好，汤姆，赶紧去把输的钱赚回来吧，别再浪费时间了。机灵鬼！查理！该干活了。来吧！都快十点了，还什么都没干呢。”","“To be sure you can, and the sooner you go the better, Tom; so make up your loss at once, and don’t lose any more time.Dodger!Charley! it’s time you were on the lay.Come! it’s near ten, and nothing done yet.”"
"小伙子们听到吩咐，向南希点点头，顺从地拿起帽子，离开了房间，机灵鬼和他那个活泼的朋友一边走，一边拿基特宁先生取笑。公平地说，基特宁先生的举止并无特别出格奇异之处。镇上还有很多精神头儿十足的年轻人，他们为了能步入上流社会而付出的代价比基特宁先生可多得多；还有好多讲究的绅士（就是他们组成了上面说到的上流社会），他们正是从与花里胡哨的托比·格拉基特几乎相同的起点，建立起自己的名声的。","In obedience to this hint, the boys, nodding to Nancy, took up their hats, and left the room; the Dodger and his vivacious friend indulging, as they went, in many witticisms at the expense of Mr. Chitling; in whose conduct, it is but justice to say, there was nothing very conspicuous or peculiar:inasmuch as there are a great number of spirited young bloods upon town, who pay a much higher price than Mr. Chitling for being seen in good society: and a great number of fine gentlemen (composing the good society aforesaid) who established their reputation upon very much the same footing as flash Toby Crackit."
"“现在，”他们走后，费金说，“我去给你拿钱，南希。这是一个小橱柜的钥匙，里面放着孩子们弄来的零碎东西，亲爱的。我从不给钱上锁，因为我没钱可锁，亲爱的——哈！哈！哈！——没钱可锁。这真是件苦差事，南希，不讨好，不过我喜欢看着这些孩子们在我身边，我可以忍受这一切，我可以忍受。嘘！”他说，急忙把钥匙藏进怀里。那是谁？听！”","“Now,” said Fagin, when they had left the room, “I’ll go and get you that cash, Nancy.This is only the key of a little cupboard where I keep a few odd things the boys get, my dear.I never lock up my money, for I’ve got none to lock up, my dear—ha! ha! ha!—none to lock up. it’s  a poor trade, Nancy, and no thanks; but I’m fond of seeing the young people about me; and I bear it all, I bear it all.Hush!” he said, hastily concealing, the key in his breast;“who’s that?Listen!”"
"姑娘正抱着胳膊坐在桌边，对来者一点儿也不感兴趣，或者说根本不在乎谁在走来走去，直到她听到一个男人的低语声。她一听到那个声音，赶忙扯下软帽和披肩，扔在桌下，速度快得好像闪电一般。犹太人立刻转过身来，她抱怨了一声天热，语气懒洋洋的，跟刚才慌乱迅速的动作形成鲜明对比。费金没注意到这一切，当时他正背对着她。","The girl, who was sitting at the table with her arms folded, appeared in no way interested in the arrival: or to care whether the person, whoever he was, came or went: until the murmur of a man’s voice reached her ears.The instant she caught the sound, she tore off her bonnet and shawl, with the rapidity of lightning, and thrust them under the table.The Jew, turning round immediately afterwards, she muttered a complaint of the heat: in a tone of languor that contrasted, very remarkably, with the extreme haste and violence of this action: which, however, had been unobserved by Fagin, who had his back towards her at the time."
"“呸！”他低声说道，好像对这打扰感到很生气。“那是我之前等的人，他正下楼来着。他在这儿的时候，别提钱的事，南希。他不会呆太久的。不超过十分钟，亲爱的。”","“Bah!” he whispered, as though nettled by the interruption; “it’s the man I expected before; he’s coming downstairs.Not a word about the money while he’s here, Nance.He won’t stop long.Not ten minutes, my dear.”"
"犹太人伸出消瘦的食指，放在嘴唇上，然后拿着蜡烛走向门口，能听见门外楼梯上男人的脚步声。他刚走到门口，来人也正好匆匆走进房间。他都走到姑娘跟前了，才看见她。","Laying his skinny forefinger upon his lip, the Jew carried a candle to the door, as a man’s step was heard upon the stairs without.He reached it, at the same moment as the visitor, who, coming hastily into the room, was close upon the girl before he observed her."
"那是蒙克斯。","It was Monks."
"“那是我的一个手下，”费金见蒙克斯看到有陌生人在，后退了一步，便说道，“别动，南希。”","“Only one of my young people,” said Fagin, observing that Monks drew back, on beholding a stranger.“Don’t move, Nancy.”"
"姑娘往桌前靠了靠，漫不经心地瞟了蒙克斯一眼，然后收回目光；不过，等他转过身去，面对着费金时，她又偷看了一眼，这次目光锐利、意味深长，如果这时有位看客注意到这一变化，肯定难以相信这两种眼神竟出自同一人。","The girl drew closer to the table, and glancing at Monks with an air of careless levity, withdrew her eyes; but as he turned towards Fagin, she stole another look; so keen and searching, and full of purpose, that if there had been any bystander to observe the change, he could hardly have believed the two looks to have proceeded from the same person."
"“有什么消息吗？”费金问道。","“Any news?” inquired Fagin."
"“大消息。”","“Great.”"
"“那么——那么——是好消息吗？”费金犹豫地问，好像怕自己乐观的态度惹恼了另一位。","“And—and—good?” asked Fagin, hesitating as yhough he feared to vex the other man by being too sanguine."
"“反正不坏。”蒙克斯笑着回答，“这次我动作可够快的。我想单独跟你谈谈。”","“Not bad, any way,” replied Monks with a smile.“I have been prompt enough this time.Let me have a word with you.”"
"姑娘又往桌前靠了靠，虽然她知道蒙克斯这句话是针对她的，但她并没表现出要离开房间的意思。犹太人害怕如果要赶姑娘走，她可能会大声提钱的事情。于是他指了指楼上，带着蒙克斯离开了房间。","The girl drew closer to the table, and made no offer to leave the room, although she could see that Monks was pointing to her.The Jew: perhaps fearing she might say something aloud about the money, if he endeavoured to get rid of her: pointed upward, and took Monks out of the room."
"“不再是我们之前的那个烂摊子了。”她听到两个人一边上楼一边说道。费金笑了，回了几句话，她没听真切。从木板的咯吱声判断，费金好像是把来客领上了二楼。","“Not that infernal hole we were in before,” she could hear the man say as they went upstairs.Fagin laughed; and making some reply which did not reach her, seemed, by the creaking of the boards, to lead his companion to the second story."
"他们的脚步声还在屋子里回响，南希却已经脱掉了鞋子，拉起衣服，松松地蒙在头上，裹住肩膀。她站在门口，屏住呼吸，专注地听着。响声一停下来，她就溜出房间，轻巧无声地上了楼梯，消失在阴暗的楼上。","Before the sound of their footsteps had ceased to echo through the house, the girl had slipped off her shoes; and drawing her gown loosely over her head, and muffling her arms in it, stood at the door, listening with breathless interest.The moment the noise ceased, she glided from the room; ascended the stairs with incredible softness and silence; and was lost in the gloom above."
"起码有一刻钟，屋子里没有人，然后，姑娘又迈着极轻的步子溜回了房间，紧接着，就听到两个男人下楼的声音。蒙克斯直接出门到街上去了，犹太人又爬上楼拿钱。他回到房间，看到姑娘在整理着披肩和软帽，好像准备走了。","The room remained deserted for a quarter of an hour or more; the girl glided back with the same unearthly tread; and, immediately afterwards, the two men were heard descending.Monks went at once into the street; and the Jew crawled upstairs again for the money.When he returned, the girl was adjusting her shawl and bonnet, as if preparing to be gone."
"“哎，南希！”犹太人放下蜡烛，惊得后退了一步，喊道，“你脸色可真苍白！”","“Why, Nance!” exclaimed the Jew, starting back as he put down the candle, “how pale you are!”"
"“苍白！”姑娘答道，双手遮住眼睛，好像准备好好打量打量他。","“Pale!” echoed thegirl, shading her eyes with her hands, as if to look steadily at him."
"“真可怕。你一直在这儿做什么？”","“Quite horrible.What have you been doing to yourself?”"
"“没什么，除了坐在这个憋闷的地方，根本不知道你们谈些什么，要谈多久。”姑娘随意地答道，“快！让我走吧，这才好。”","“Nothing that I know of, except sitting in this close place for I don’t know how long and all,” replied the girl carelessly.“Come!Let me get back; that’s a dear.”"
"费金点着钱，放在姑娘手里，点一张叹一口气。他们只互道了一句“晚安”，没再多说话就分手了。","With a sigh for every piece of money, Fagin told the amount into her hand.They parted without more conversation, merely interchanging a “good-night.”"
"姑娘走到大街上，在一个台阶上坐了下来。有一会儿，她看上去好像完全迷茫了，不知要走哪条路似的。突然，她站起身，朝一个方向快步走去，那正是跟赛克斯正等着她回去的地方相反的方向。她渐渐加快步伐，最后竟狂奔起来。她跑得精疲力尽，终于停了下来喘口气；接着，她好像忽然意识到自己正在做一件想完成却无力完成的事情，不禁十分悲伤。她搓着双手，眼泪夺眶而出。","When the girl got into the open street, she sat down upon a doorstep; and seemed, for a few moments, wholly bewildered and unable to pursue her way.Suddenly she arose; and hurrying on, in a direction quite opposite to that in which Sikes was awaiting her returned, quickened her pace, until it gradually resolved into a violent run.After completely exhausting herself, she stopped to take breath: and, as if suddenly recollecting herself, and deploring her inability to do something she was bent upon, wrung her hands, and burst into tears."
"可能是泪水让她得到了发泄，要不就是对自己的境况感到完全绝望，她转过身来，朝着反方向以差不多同样的速度跑起来。一方面为了补上浪费的时间，另一方面也是为了与自己脑中激烈的思想意识保持一致，不一会儿，她就回到了强盗的住处。","It might be that her tears relieved her, or that she felt the full hopelessness of her condition; but she turned back; and hurrying with nearly as great rapidity in the contrary direction; partly to recover lost time, and partly to keep pace with the violent current of her own thoughts: soon reached the dwelling where she had left the housebreaker."
"她见到赛克斯先生的时候，尽管无意中流露出了一些焦虑不安，但对方并未察觉出。他只是问了问她是不是拿了钱来，听到肯定的回答，也就满意地嘟囔了一声，又倒回枕头上，继续那因为姑娘回来而被打断的美梦。","If she betrayed any agitation, when she presented herself to Mr. Sikes, he did not observe it; for merely inquiring if she had brought the money, and receiving a reply in the affirmative, he uttered a growl of satisfaction, and replacing his head upon the pillow, resumed the slumbers which her arrival had interrupted."
"她运气很好，赛克斯第二天拿着钱就去吃吃喝喝了，这样一来他暴躁的脾气也得到了缓和，效果颇佳；他既没有时间，也没有心思对她的行为举止挑三拣四。她心不在焉，神经紧张，好像正要迈出大胆而危险的一步，这也是她经过一番非同寻常的斗争才做出的决定。这样的表情逃不过费金锐利的目光，他很可能立刻就警觉起来；不过赛克斯先生的辨别能力就没有这么细致了，他从不为细微的事情担心，要不然就是用固执的粗暴态度解决了，而且，前面已经说到，他现在态度和蔼，颇为反常；因此，他并没觉得她的行为有什么异常，也的确实没有因为她而有一丝担心。即使她的不安更为明显，也不大可能引起他的疑心。","It was fortunate for her that the possession of money occasioned him so much employment next day in the way of eating and drinking; and withal had so beneficial an effect in smoothing down the asperities of his temper; that he had neither time nor inclination to be very critical upon her behaviour and deportment.That she had all the abstracted and nervous manner of one who is on the eve of some bold and hazardous step, which it has required no common struggle to resolve upon, would have been obvious to the lynx-eyed Fagin, who would most probably have taken the alarm at once;but Mr. Sikes lacking the niceties of discrimination, and being troubled with no more subtle misgivings than those which resolve themselves into a dogged roughness of behaviour towards everybody; and being, furthermore, in an unusually amiable condition, as has been already observed;saw nothing unusual in her demeanor, and indeed, troubled himself so little about her, that, had her agitation been far more perceptible than it was, it would have been very unlikely to have awakened his suspicions."
"那天晚些时候，姑娘越来越焦躁。夜色降临后，她坐在一旁看着、等着强盗喝醉后再睡着。她脸色异常苍白，眼睛里似乎有火焰燃烧，赛克斯看了也大吃一惊。","As that day closed in, the girl’s excitement increased; and, when night came on, and she sat by, watching until the housebreaker should drink himself asleep, there was an unusual paleness in her cheek, and a fire in her eye, that even Sikes observed with astonishment."
"因为发烧，赛克斯先生十分虚弱。他躺在床上，喝着为减轻刺激而掺了水的杜松子酒；这是他第三次或第四次把杯子推到南希面前，让她给满上。这时，他才首次注意到这些迹象，大吃一惊。","Mr. Sikes being weak from the fever, was lying in bed, taking hot water with his gin to render it less inflammatory; and had pushed his glass towards Nancy to be replenished for the third or fourth time, when these symptoms first struck him."
"“哎，该死！”男人说道，他盯着姑娘的脸，用手撑着坐起来。“你简直就像是又活过来的死尸。","“Why, burn my body!” said the man, raising himself on his hands as he stared the girl in the face.“You look like a corpse come to life again.What’s the matter?”"
"“什么！”姑娘答道。“没什么。你这么盯着我干嘛？”","“Matter!” replied the girl.“Nothing.What do you look at me so hard for?”"
"“这叫什么蠢话？”赛克斯追问道，抓住她的胳膊，粗鲁地摇着。“究竟什么事？你什么意思？在想什么呢？”","“What foolery is this?” demanded Sikes, grasping her by the arm, and shaking her roughly.“What is it?What do you mean?What are you thinking of?”"
"“在想很多事，比尔。”姑娘颤抖着回答，一边用双手捂住眼睛。“可是，天哪！没什么可奇怪的！”","“Of many things, Bill,” replied the girl, shivering, and as she did so, pressing her hands upon her eyes.“But, Lord!What odds in that?”"
"她强装欢乐地说出那最后一句话，比之前那种魂不守舍的样子更让赛克斯印象深刻。","The tone of forced gaiety in which the last words were spoken, seemed to produce a deeper impression on Sikes than the wild and rigid look which had preceded them."
"“我来告诉你这是什么，”赛克斯说，“你不是发烧了，而且是即将发作的话，就一定是有些什么事不对劲了，应该还挺危险。你不会是要——不，见鬼！你不会干出这种事！”","“I tell you wot it is,” said Sikes; “if you haven’t caught the fever, and got it comin” on, now, there’s something more than usual in the wind, and something dangerous too.You’re not a-going to—.No, damme! you wouldn’t do that! ”"
"“干出什么事？”姑娘问。","“Do what?” asked the girl."
"“不，”赛克斯盯着她，喃喃自语道，“再没有比这女人更忠诚的了，要不早在三个月前，我就已经割断她的喉咙了。她一定是热病要发作了，肯定是这样。”","“There ain’t,” said Sikes, fixing his eyes upon her, and muttering the words to himself; “there ain’t a stauncher-hearted gal going, or I’d have cut her throat three months ago.She’s got the fever coming on; that’s it.”"
"赛克斯通过这样的想法增强自己对南希的信心，他把酒喝了个底朝天，然后又骂骂咧咧地叫南希给他拿药。姑娘异常敏捷地跳起来，迅速倒好了药，不过是背对着他的，接着把杯子举到他唇边，他一饮而尽。","Fortifying himself with this assurance, Sikes drained the glass to the bottom, and then, with many grumbling oaths, called for his physic.The girl jumped up, with great alacrity; poured it quickly out, but with her back towards him; and held the vessel to his lips, while he drank off the contents."
"“现在，”这个强盗说，“过来坐在我旁边，拿出你原先的样子来，不然我可要让你变个模样，变得你连自己都认不出来。”","“Now,” said the robber, “come and sit aside of me, and put on your own face; or I’ll alter it so, that you won’t know it agin when you do want it.”"
"姑娘照做了。赛克斯把姑娘的手紧握在自己手里，躺倒在枕头上，眼神落在她身上。他闭了会儿眼，又睁开；然后又闭上，再睁开。他不停地换姿势，时不时睡个两三分钟，然后一脸恐惧地醒过来，茫然地看看四周。他好像正要起身，却突然倒下去，陷入了沉睡。他的手松开了，高举着的手臂无力地落在身旁，他躺在那里，昏睡不醒。","The girl obeyed.Sikes, locking her hand in his, fell back upon the pillow: turning his eyes upon her face.They closed; opened again; closed once more; again opened.He shifted his position restlessly; and, after dozing again, and again, for two or three minutes, and as often springing up with a look of terror, and gazing vacantly about him, was suddenly stricken, as it were, while in the very attitude of rising, into a deep and heavy sleep.The grasp of his hand relaxed; the upraised arm fell languidly by his side; and he lay like one in a profound trance."
"“鸦片酊还是见效了。”姑娘喃喃说道，从床边站起身来。“但是现在，可能已经太晚了。”","“The laudanum has taken effect at last,” murmured the girl, as she rose from the bedside.“I may be too late, even now.”"
"她匆匆戴上软帽，裹上披肩，时不时紧张地向四周望望。虽然用上了安眠药，但她每时每刻好像还能感觉到赛克斯的大手搭在她肩膀上。然后，她温柔地俯下身，吻了吻强盗的嘴唇，接着悄无声息地打开房门，再关上门，匆忙走了出去。","She hastily dressed herself in her bonnet and shawl: looking fearfully round, from time to time, as if, despite the sleeping draught, she expected every moment to feel the pressure of Sikes’s heavy hand upon her shoulder; then, stooping softly over the bed, she kissed the robber’s lips; and then opening and closing the room-door with noiseless touch, hurried from the house."
"要走到大街上，她还得穿过一条黑沉沉的小巷。在那里，她听到守夜人吆喝着九点半了。","A watchman was crying half-past nine, down a dark passage through which she had to pass, in gaining the main thoroughfare."
"“已经过半点了吗？”姑娘问道。","“Has it long gone the half-hour?” asked the girl."
"“再过一刻钟就十点了。”守夜人答道，并举起灯笼，光线照在她的脸上。","“It’ll strike the hour in another quarter,” said the man: raising his lantern to her face."
"“我没法在一个多小时内赶到那儿。”南希低声嘀咕着，轻快地从他身边走过，不一会儿就来到了大街上。","“And I cannot get there in less than an hour or more,” muttered Nancy: brushing swiftly past him, and gliding rapidly down the street."
"她从斯皮达菲赶往伦敦西区，一路上，经过了许多大街小巷，而路上的店家大都已经打烊了。钟敲响了十下，她愈发急躁不安了。她沿着狭窄的人行道快步往前走，胳膊肘不时撞到行人。当其他人还在心急如焚地等马车过去再过马路时，她却几乎是从马的头底下冲到马路对面。","Many of the shops were already closing in the back lanes and avenues through which she tracked her way, in making from Spitalfields towards the West-End of London.The clock struck ten, increasing her impatience.She tore along the narrow pavement: elbowing the passengers from side to side; and darting almost under the horses’ heads, crossed crowded streets, where clusters of persons were eagerly watching their opportunity to do the like."
"“这女人疯了！”她匆忙过去后，人们纷纷转过身来看她，说道。","“The woman is mad!” said the people, turning to look after her as she rushed away."
"她来到镇上比较富裕的地区，这里的街道相比宽敞些。她鲁莽地前行，那些被她匆忙超越的人更加好奇了。","When she reached the more wealthy quarter of the town, the streets were comparatively deserted; and here her headlong progress excited a still greater curiosity in the stragglers whom she hurried past."
"有些人在后面加快了步伐，好像想要搞清楚她这么急匆匆的是想要往哪里去；有几个人赶到她前面回头看，惊讶地发现她仍然没有放慢速度；人们一个接一个地给落在了后面，快到目的地的时候，只剩她一个人了。","Some quickened their pace behind, as though to see whither she was hastening at such an unusual rate; and a few made head upon her, and looked back, surprised at her undiminished speed; but they fell off one by one; and when she neared her place of destination, she was alone."
"那是一间家庭旅馆，坐落在海德公园附近一条安静美观的大街上。旅馆门前的路灯发出耀眼的光芒，她顺着灯光来到门口，这时，钟敲了十一下。她在门口徘徊了几步，似乎有些犹豫，又想要下决心走进去。不过这钟声让她打定了主意，于是她走进了旅馆大厅。门房的座位上没有人。她疑惑地向四处打量了一番，又朝楼梯走去。","It was a family hotel in a quiet but handsome street near Hyde Park.As the brilliant light of the lamp which burnt before its door, guided her to the spot, the clock struck eleven.She had loitered for a few paces as though irresolute, and making up her mind to advance; but the sound determined her, and she stepped into the hall.The porter’s seat was vacant.She looked round with an air of incertitude, and advanced towards the stairs."
"“喂，小姐！”一个穿着入时的女人从她身后的一道门里探出头来，叫住了她。“你找谁？”","“Now, young woman!”　said a smartly-dressed female, looking out from a door behind her, “who do you want here?”"
"“住在这里的一位小姐。”姑娘答道。","“A lady who is stopping in this house,” answered the girl."
"“一位小姐！”那女人带着轻蔑的神色回敬道，“哪位小姐？”","“A lady!” was the reply accompanied with a scornful look.“What lady?”"
"“梅莱小姐。”南希说。","“Miss Maylie,” said Nancy."
"那女人这时才注意到南希的模样，高傲而鄙夷地看了她一眼，就找来一个男人招呼她。南希又向他重复了一遍请求。“您怎么称呼？”侍者问道。","The young woman, who had by this time, noted her appearance, replied only by a look of virtuous disdain; and summoned a man to answer her.To him, Nancy repeated her request. “What name am I to say?” asked the waiter."
"“不用说我的名字。”南希答道。","“It’s of no use saying any,” replied Nancy."
"“也不说什么事吗？”男人问。","“Nor business?” said the man."
"“不，那也不用说。”姑娘回答,“我必须要见见这位小姐。”","“No, nor that neither,” rejoined the girl.“I must see the lady.”"
"“得了吧！”男人把她往门口推。“没这样的事。你出去。”","“Come!” said the man, pushing her towards the door.“None of this.Take yourself off.”"
"“除非你把我抬出去！”南希情绪激动地嚷道，“那样你们两个人恐怕都不行。这里还有别人吗？”她四处张望着，“能不能帮我这可怜的人带个简单的口信？”","“I shall be carried out if I go!” said the girl violently; “and I can make that a job that two of you won’t like to do.Isn’t there anybody here,” she said, looking round, “that will see a simple message carried for a poor wretch like me?”"
"这个请求打动了一位看起来好脾气的厨子，他刚才正和其他几位侍者在一旁看热闹，这时便走了出来。","This appeal produced an effect on a good-tempered-faced man-cook, who with some of the other servants was looking on, and who stepped forward to interfere."
"“乔，就给她带个口信吧，行吗？”厨子说。","“Take it up for her, Joe; can’t you?” said this person."
"“有什么用？”男人问道，“难道你认为小姐会见她这种人？”","“What’s the good?” replied the man.“You don’t suppose the young lady will see such as her; do you?”"
"这句话似乎暗示南希身份可疑，于是在那四个贞洁的女仆心中激起了极大的怒火，她们义愤填膺，纷纷表示她是女人的耻辱，强烈建议要把她毫不留情地扔到沟里去。","This allusion to Nancy’s doubtful character, raised a vast quantity of chaste wrath in the bosoms of four housemaids, who remarked, with great fervour, that the creature was a disgrace to her sex; and strongly advocated her being thrown, ruthlessly, into the kennel."
"“随便你们。”姑娘说着，又转向男人，“不过先答应我的请求，看在上帝的份上，我要你带个口信。”","“Do what you like with me,” said the girl, turning to the men again; “but do what I ask you first, and I ask you to give this message for God Almighty’s sake.”"
"那位善良的厨子又调解一番，结果还是最先出来的那位侍者去传话。","The soft-hearted cook added his intercession, and the result was that the man who had first appeared undertook its delivery."
"“什么口信？”男人问道，一只脚踏上了楼梯。","“What’s it to be?” siad the man, with one foot on the stairs."
"“有一个年轻女人真心希望能和梅莱小姐单独谈谈。”南希说，“梅莱小姐只要听到这个年轻女人说的第一个字，就会知道是应该听来者继续说下去，还是把她当作骗子赶出门去。”","“That a young woman earnestly asks to speak to Miss Maylie alone,” said Nancy; “and that if the lady will only hear the first word she has to say, she will know whet her to hear her business, or to have her turned out of doors as an impostor.”"
"“我说，”男人说道，“你倒是挺会添枝加叶的！”","“I say,” said the man, “you’re coming it strong!”"
"“你就这么传话，”姑娘坚定地说，“让我知道回话。”","“You give the message,” said the girl firmly; “and let me hear the answer.”"
"男人跑上楼去了。南希呆在原地，脸色苍白，几乎屏住了呼吸，听着那些女仆喋喋不休地大声冷嘲热讽，她气得嘴唇发抖；侍者回来后，让她上楼去，于是她们更是变本加厉地议论起来。","The man ran upstairs.Nancy remained, pale and almost breathless, listening with quivering lip to the very audible expressions of scorn, of which the chaste housemaids were very prolific; and of which they became still more so, when the man returned, and said the young woman was to walk upstairs."
"“这世上，恪守规矩可没什么好处。”第一位侍女说道。","“It’s no good being proper in this world,” said the first housemaid."
"“破铜烂铁也比烧过的金子强。”第二位说。","“Brass can do better than the gold what has stood the fire,” said the second."
"第三位为自己提出“小姐是什么样的”，颇感满足；而第四位则叫道“无耻”，为四重奏开了个头，然后这几位如戴安娜般贞洁的女士都重复了这句话后，才总算住口了。","The third contented herself with wondering “what ladies was made of”; and the fourth took the first in a quartette of “Shameful!” with thich the Dianas concluded."
"南希对这些一点儿也不在意，因为她心里想着更重要的事情；她浑身发颤，跟着侍者来到一间小小的会客厅，天花板上的一盏吊灯照亮了屋子。侍者留下她一个人，退了出去。","Regardless of all this: for she had weightier matters at heart: Nancy followed the man, with trembling limbs, to a small ante-chamber, lighted by a lamp from the ceiling.Here he left her, and retired."
"第四十章 紧接着上一章而来的一次不寻常的会面","CHAPTER XL A strange interview, which is a sequel to the last chamber"
"这姑娘一直混迹于街头，在伦敦那些最肮脏的妓院和贼窝中生活，不过她心里仍然保留着一些女人的天性。她听见一阵轻轻的脚步声，朝着与她进去时那扇门的相反方向走来，想到在这个小小的房间内马上就要出现的鲜明对比，她觉得一种深重的自卑感压上心头，她缩起身子，似乎无法承受即将与她会面的那个人的出现。","The girl’s life had been squandered in the streets, and among the most noisome of the stews and dens of London, but there was something of the woman’s original nature left in her still; and when she heard a light step approaching the door opposite to that by which she had entered, and thought of the wide contrast which the small room would in another moment contain, she felt burdened with the sense of her own deep shame, and shrunk as though she could scarcely bear the presence of her with whom she had sought this interview."
"不过，与这些想法相斗争的是一种骄傲——这个坏习惯在那些最底层、最下贱的人身上不见得就比在那些高贵自信的人身上少。这个可怜的姑娘与一群窃贼、恶棍为伍，是个经常出没于下流地方的、无家可归的人，还与一些监狱牢房里的渣滓为伴，那些人自己都生活在绞刑架的阴影之下。即使是这么一个堕落的人也会觉得骄傲，不愿流露出一丝女性的情感，她觉得那是软弱的象征。但正是这种情感将她和人性相联系，但从她小时候起，那虚度光阴的生活就已经抹去了许多人性的痕迹。","But struggling with these better feelings was pride,—the vice of the lowest and most debased creatures no less than of the high and self-assured.The miserable companion of thieves and ruffians, the fallen outcast of low haunts, the associate of the scourings of the jails and hulks, living within the shadow of the gallows itself,—even this degraded being felt too proud to betray a feeble gleam of the womanly feeling which she thought a weakness,but which alone connected her with that humanity, of which her wasting life had obliterated so many, many traces when a very child."
"她抬起眼来，刚好看见一位苗条、美丽的姑娘出现在面前，然后她又垂下眼看着地上，故作轻松地摇摇头，说道：“要见到您可真不容易啊，小姐。要是我像别人一样生气了，或者转身就走了，你有一天肯定会为此感到后悔的，而且这后悔是有缘故的。”","She raised her eyes sufficiently to observe that the figure which presented itself was that of a slight and beautiful girl; then, bending them on the ground, she tossed her head with affected carelessness as she said: “It’s a hard matter to get to see you, lady.If I had taken offence, and gone away, as many would have done, you’d have been sorry for it one day, and not without reason either.”"
"“如果有人冒犯了你，我很抱歉。”罗丝回答道，“别再去想它了。告诉我，为什么你想见我。我就是你要找的人。”","“I am very sorry if any one has behaved harshly to you,” replied Rose.“Do not think of that.Tell me why you wished to see me.I am the person you inquired for.”"
"小姐答话时所用的这种亲切的语气，甜美的声音，温柔的态度，丝毫没有任何傲慢或者不满，这完全是姑娘没有想到的，她一下子哭了出来。","The kind tone of this answer, the sweet voice, the gentle manner, the absence of any accent of haughtiness or displeasure, took the girl completely by surprise, and she burst into tears."
"“哦，小姐，小姐！”她双手紧握在面前，激动地说，“要是像你这样的人多一些，我这样的人就会少很多——是这样的——就是这样的！”","“Oh, lady, lady!” she said, clasping her hands passionately before her face, “if there was more like you, there would be fewer like me,—there would—there would!”"
"“请坐。”罗丝诚恳地说，“要是你生活困苦，或者有什么不幸，只要我能做到，我都会诚心诚意地帮你——真的。请坐。”","“Sit down,” said Rose, earnestly.“If you are in poverty or affliction I shall be truly glad to relieve you if I can,—I shall indeed.Sit down.”"
"“就让我站着吧，小姐。”姑娘抽泣着说道，“在你了解我之前，请不要这样亲切地和我说话。越来越晚了。门——门——那扇门关上了吗？”","“Let me stand, lady,” said the girl, still weeping, “and do not speak to me so kindly till you know me better.It is growing late.Is—is—that door shut?”"
"“关上了。”罗丝说着，后退了几步，好像一旦需要帮助时，这样可以更方便些。“怎么了？”","“Yes,” said Rose, recoiling a few steps, as if to be nearer assistance in case she should require it.“Why?”"
"“因为，”姑娘说，“我将要把我和其他一些人的性命都交给你。我就是那个把小奥利弗拖回老费金家的姑娘，就是在他从本顿维尔那间屋子里跑出来的那个晚上。”","“Because,” said the girl, “I am about to put my life and the lives of others in your hands.I am the girl that dragged little Oliver back to old Fagin’s on the night he went out from the house in Pentonville.”"
"“是你！”罗丝·梅莱说。","“You!” said Rose Maylie."
"“是我，小姐！”姑娘答道，“我就是你听说过的那个无耻的人，和小偷们住在一起。自从我能够记起来走上伦敦街头的那一刻，我就没过上一天好日子，没听过一句好听话，我一直顺从他们的意思生活，听他们的话。上帝啊，帮帮我！你要是想离我远一些，我不会介意的，小姐。我要比你眼里看到的小一些，我对此已经习以为常了。我走在拥挤的人行道上时，连最贫穷的女人都要连连后退。”","“I, lady!” replied the girl.“I am the infamous creature you have heard of, that lives among the thieves, and that never from the first moment I can recollect my eyes and senses opening on London streets have known any better life, or kinder words than they have given me, so help me God!Do not mind shrinking openly from me, lady.I am younger than you would think, to look at me, but I am well used to it.The poorest women fall back, as I make my way along the crowded pavement.”"
"“这都是些多么可怕的事啊！”罗丝说道，不自觉地从这位陌生来客身边退开。","“What dreadful things are these!” said Rose, involuntarily falling from her strange companion."
"“跪下来感谢上帝吧，亲爱的小姐，”姑娘大声说道，“在你童年时有朋友来照顾你、陪伴你，从来没有缺衣少食，没有经历过暴乱和醉酒闹事，还有——还有——比这些更糟糕的事——而我从在摇篮里起就对这一切习惯了。我用这个词，是因为小巷和阴沟就是我的摇篮，它们也将成为我临死所卧之床。”","“Thank Heaven upon your knees, dear lady,” cried the girl, “that you had friends to care for and keep you in your childhood, and that you were never in the midst of cold and hunger, and riot and drunkenness, and—and—something worse than all—as I have been from my cradle.I may use the word, for the alley and the gutter were mine, as they will be my deathbed.”"
"“你真可怜！”罗丝喊着，她几乎说不出话了。“听到你这么说，我的心都碎了！”","“I pity you!” said Rose, in a broken voice.“It wrings my heart to hear you!”"
"“上帝保佑你的好心！”姑娘回答道，“要是你知道我有时候是怎么样的，你也许确实会同情我。但是我从那些人身边逃出来了，他们要是知道我在这儿，还把我偷听来的话告诉你，他们准会杀了我的。你认不认识一个叫蒙克斯的人？”","“Heaven bless you for your goodness!” rejoined the girl.“If you knew what I am sometimes, you would pity me, indeed.But I have stolen away from those who would surely murder me, if they knew I had been here, to tell you what I have overheard.Do you know a man named Monks?”"
"“不认识。”罗丝说。","“No,” said Rose."
"“可是他认识你。”姑娘回答，“也知道你住在这里，我就是听到他说出这个地址，才来这里找你的。”","“He knows you,” replied the girl; “and knew you were here, for it was by hearing him tell the place that I found you out.”"
"“我从没听过这个名字。”罗丝说。","“I never heard the name,” said Rose."
"“那一定是我们那伙人里的谁告诉他的。”姑娘答道，“我之前也这么想过。不久前，就在奥利弗因为抢劫被带到你家里的那晚不久，我——因为怀疑这个人——所以暗中偷听到他和费金之间的一段对话。根据我听到的，我发现蒙克斯，就是我刚才问你的那个人，你知道——”“是的，”罗丝说，“我知道。”","“Then he goes by some other amongst us,” rejoined the girl, “which I more than thought before.Some time ago, and soon after Oliver was put into your house on the night of the robbery, I—suspecting this man—listened to a conversation held between him and Fagin in the dark.I found out, from what I heard, that Monks—the man I asked you about, you know—” “Yes,” said Rose, “I understand.”"
"“——蒙克斯，”姑娘继续说道，“碰巧看见奥利弗和我们的另外两个男孩子在一起，就在他头一次不见了的那一天，而且，蒙克斯立刻就知道这正是他要找的孩子，虽然我不知道为什么。于是他和费金谈成了一笔交易，要是能把奥利弗弄回来，费金就能拿到一笔钱；要是还能把他培养成个小偷，能拿到的钱就更多了，蒙克斯这样做自有他的目的。”","“—That Monks,” pursued the girl, “had seen him accidently with two of our boys on the day we first lost him, and had known him directly to be the same child that he was watching for, though I couldn’t make out why.A bargain was struck with Fagin, that if Oliver was got back he should have a certain sum; and he was to have more for making him a thief, which this Monks wanted for some purpose of his own.”"
"“什么目的？”罗丝问道。","“For what purpose?” asked Rose."
"“我正偷听着，希望能弄明白，可他在墙上看到了我的影子，”姑娘说，“除了我，没有多少人能及时逃走而且不被发现。可是我就是逃走了，直到昨晚我才再看到他。”","“He caught sight of my shadow on the wall as I listened, in the hope of finding out,” said the girl; “and there are not many people besides me that could have got out of their way in time to escape discovery.But I did; and I saw him no more till last night.”"
"“那么当时又发生了什么事？”","“And what occurred then?”"
"“我这就告诉你，小姐。昨晚他又来了。他们又到楼上去，而我呢，我把自己给裹了起来，这样就不会因为影子而暴露了。我又在门口偷听。我听到蒙克斯说的第一句话是这样的：‘这样，那些唯一可以证明孩子身份的东西已经沉入河底了，而那个从他母亲那里得到这些东西的老婆子正在她的棺材里腐烂呢。’他们笑了，说他这次干得很出色，蒙克斯又继续说起那个孩子，语气变得很野蛮，他说虽然现在那小鬼的钱已经到手了，他倒希望是用另一种方式拿到的；因为，要是能在他身上好好赚上一笔之后，再把他送到伦敦每一所监狱里去，然后让费金毫不费力地给他弄个死罪吊死，把他父亲在遗嘱中吹下的牛皮捅破，这才好玩呢。”","“I’ll tell you, lady.Last night he came again.Again they went upstairs, and I, wrapping myself up so that my shadow would not betray me, again listened at the door.The first words I heard Monks say were these: ‘So the only proofs of the boy’s identity lie at the bottom of the river, and the old hag that received them from the mother is rotting in her coffin.’　“They laughed, and talked of his success in doing this; and Monks, talking on about the boy, and getting very wild, said that though he had got the young devil’s money safely now, he’d rather have had it the other way;for, what a game it would have been to have brought down the boast of the father’s will, by driving him through every jail in town, and then hauling him up for some capital felony which Fagin could easily manage, after having made a good profit of him besides.”"
"“这都是些什么话！”罗丝说。","“What is all this!” said Rose."
"“真话，小姐，虽然是从我嘴里说出来的。”姑娘回答道，“后来，他又说了些脏话，我是听惯了的，不过你肯定没听过。他说要是他能既要了这孩子的命，自己又不会有上绞刑架的危险，他一定会这样做来泄心头之恨的。但是，他能力不够，因此他要在奥利弗生命的每一个转折关头盯着他，如果他能利用奥利弗的出身和经历，就还有机会伤害他。‘简而言之，费金，’他说，‘虽然你是犹太人，但也绝不会像我这样给我小兄弟，奥利弗，设下这种陷阱的。’”“他的兄弟！”罗丝惊叫道。","“The truth, lady, though it comes from my lips,” replied the girl.“Then, he said, with oaths common enough in my ears, but strange to yours, that if he could gratify his hatred by taking the boy’s life without bringing his own neck in danger, he would; but, as he couldn’t, he’d be upon the watch to meet him at every turn in life; and if he took advantage of his birth and history, he might harm him yet.”‘In short, Fagin,’ he says, ‘Jew as you are, you never laid such snares as I’ll contrive for my young brother, Oliver.’”“His brother!” exclaimed Rose."
"“那是他的原话。”南希一边说，一边不安地四下看看。自从她开始说话以来，就几乎不停地向四周张望，因为她总感觉赛克斯的影子就在她身边。“还有呢。当他提到你和另一位女士时说，好像上帝或者魔鬼存心跟他作对，才让奥利弗落到你们的手里；他笑了起来，还说这事想起来倒也让人觉得安慰，你们为了弄清楚这两条腿的哈巴狗是谁，几千几万英镑你们也愿意出，只要你们出得起。”","“Those were his words,” said Nancy, glancing uneasily round, as she had scarcely ceased to do, since she began to speak, for a vision of Sikes haunted her perpetually.“And more.When he spoke of you and the other lady, and said it seemed contrived by Heaven, or the devil, against him, that Oliver should come into your hands, he laughed, and said there was some comfort in that too, for how many thousands and hundreds of thousands of pounds would you not give, if you had them, to know who your two-legged spaniel was.”"
"“你不会是，”罗丝说道，脸色变得十分苍白，“要告诉我这话是真的吧？”","“You do not mean,” said Rose, turning very pale, “to tell me that this was said in earnest?”"
"“他说这话时咬牙切齿，恶狠狠的，绝对当真。”姑娘摇了摇头回答道，“他的仇恨心一起，从不会说笑。我认识的好些人都做过更坏的事，不过我情愿听他们所有人讲上十次八次，也不愿听蒙克斯讲一次。越来越晚了，我得赶紧回家，免得让人怀疑我为这件事跑了一趟。我得赶快回去了。”","“He spoke in hard and angry earnest, if a man ever did,” replied the girl, shaking her head.“He is an earnest man when his hatred is up.I know many who do worse things; but I’d rather listen to them all a dozen times, than to that Monks once.It is growing late, and I have to reach home without suspicion of having been on such an errand as this.I must get back quickly.”"
"“那我能做些什么？”罗丝说，“你走了，我根据你这番话能做些什么呢？回来！你把你的同伴描述得那么可怕，你为什么还要想着回去呢？我可以马上从隔壁房间叫一位绅士来，要是你把这些话再对他重复一遍，不出半小时，你就能给安排到安全的地方。”","“But what can I do?” said Rose. “To what use can I turn this communication without you?Back!Why do you wish to return to companions you paint in such terrible colors?If you repeat this information to a gentleman whom I can summon in an instant from the next room, you can be consigned to some place of safety without half an hour’s delay.”"
"“我想回去，”姑娘说，“我必须得回去，因为——我怎么能把这种事跟你这位单纯的小姐说呢？——因为在我刚才跟你提起的那些人中间，有这么一位，他是最不顾死活的，我不能离开他。是的，哪怕能让我摆脱我现在的这种生活，我也离不开他。”","“I wish to go back,” said the girl. “I must go back, because—how can I tell such things to an innocent lady like you?—because among the men I have told you of, there is one: the most desperate among them all; that I can’t leave: no, not even to be saved from the life I am leading now.”"
"“你以前保护过这个可爱的孩子，”罗丝说，“你冒着这么大的危险，来到这儿告诉我你偷听到的话；你说话的语气让我相信你所说的一切都是真的，你明显带着悔意和羞耻感，这一切都让我相信你是可以改过自新的。哦！”罗丝恳切地说道，她双手合在一起，泪水划过脸庞，“我也是一个女子，不要对我的恳求置若罔闻。我是第一个——我相信我是第一个用这样充满怜惜和同情的语气对你说话的人。听我的话吧，让我来挽救你，你可以做一些好事。”","“Your having interfered in this dear boy’s behalf before,” said Rose; “your coming here, at so great a risk, to tell me what you have heard; your manner, which convinces me of the truth of what you say; your evident contrition, and sense of shame; all lead me to believe that you might yet be reclaimed.Oh!” said the earnest girl, folding her hands as the tears coursed down her face, “do not turn a deaf ear to the entreaties of one of your own sex; the first—the first, I do believe, who ever appealed to you in the voice of pity and compassion.Do hear my words, and let me save you yet, for better things.”"
"“小姐，”姑娘跪下来，哭着说，“亲爱的、可爱的、如天使一样的小姐啊，你是第一个用这样的话为我祝福的人。如果我几年前听到这番话，也许它们能把我从充满罪恶和伤痛的生活中解救出来，但是现在一切都晚了，太晚了！”","“Lady,” cried the girl, sinking on her knees, “dear, sweet, angel lady, you are the first that ever blessed me with such words as these, and if I had heard them years ago, they might have turned me from a life of sin and sorrow; but it is too late, it is too late!”"
"“忏悔和赎罪，”罗丝说，“从来都不会太晚的。”","“It is never too late,” said Rose, “for penitence and atonement.”"
"“太晚了。”姑娘内心痛苦地挣扎，哭道，“现在我已经离不开他了！我不能让他去送死。”","“It is,” cried the girl, writhing in agony of her mind; “I cannot leave him now!I could not be his death.”"
"“你怎么会让他去送死？”罗丝问道。","“Why should you be?” asked Rose."
"“什么都救不了他了。”姑娘哭着说，“如果我把刚才对你说的那番话告诉了别人，让他们都被抓起来，他就必死无疑了。他是最鲁莽的那个，而且很残忍！”","“Nothing could save him,” cried the girl. “If I told others what I have told you, and led to their being taken, he would be sure to die.He is the boldest, and has been so cruel!”"
"“为了这么一个人，”罗丝也哭着说，“你怎么能放弃所有未来的希望，放弃那近在咫尺的获救机会呢？这简直是发疯了。”","“Is it possible,” cried Rose, “that for such a man as this, you can resign every future hope, and the certainty of immediate rescue?It is madness.”"
"“我也不知道这是为什么，”姑娘答道，“我只知道就是这样的，而且不光我一人，还有成百上千个像我一样又可恶又可怜的人。我必须回去。我不知道是不是因为我做过的坏事惹得上帝发怒了，可是无论要承受怎样的折磨和虐待，我还是要回到他身边。我相信，即使我知道我最终将死在他手上，我也必须回去。”","“I don’t know what it is,” answered the girl; “I only know that it is so, and not with me alone, but with hundreds of others as bad and wretched as myself.I must go back.Whether it is God’s wrath for the wrong I have done, I do not know; but I am drawn back to him through every suffering and ill usage; and I should be, I believe, if I knew that I was to die by his hand at last.”"
"“那么我该做些什么？”罗丝说，“我不该让你就这样离开的。”","“What am I to do?” said Rose.“I should not let you depart from me thus.”"
"“你应该的，小姐，我也知道你会这么做的。”姑娘站起身来，回答道，“你不会不让我走的，因为我相信你的善良，我也没有逼你做出任何承诺，尽管我本可以这样做。”","“You should, lady, and I know you will,” rejoined the girl, rising.“You will not stop my going because I have trusted in your goodness, and forced no promise from you, as I might have done.”"
"“那么，你刚才说的那番话有什么用？”罗丝说，“这个谜团必须解开，不然你对我说的这番话要怎么样帮助奥利弗呢，你又是这么急切地想要搭救他？”","“Of what use, then, is the communication you have made?” said Rose.“This mystery must be investigated, or how will its disclosure to me, benefit Oliver, whom you are anxious to serve?”"
"“你得找你身边一位好心的绅士，让他知道这个秘密，然后他就会告诉你应该怎么做。”姑娘回答道。","“You must have some kind gentleman about you that will hear it as a secret, and advise you what to do,” rejoined the girl."
"“不过，如果我要找你，能在哪里再找到你呢？”罗丝问，“我并不是想知道这些可怕的人住在哪儿，不过，以后你会在什么固定的时间散步或者经过什么地方吗？”","“But where can I find you again when it is necessary?” asked Rose.“I do not seek to know where these dreadful people live, but where will you be walking or passing at any settled period from this time?”"
"“你得答应我，严格保守我告诉你的这个秘密，就你一个人，或者和另一位也知道这秘密的人一起来找我，而我也不会被盯梢或者跟踪，行吗？”姑娘问道。","“Will you promise me that you will have my secret strictly kept, and come alone, or with the only other person that knows it; and that I shall not be watched or followed?” asked the girl."
"“我郑重地向你承诺。”罗丝回答。","“I promise you solemnly,” answered Rose."
"“每个礼拜天的晚上，从十一点直到钟敲十二下，”姑娘不假思索地说，“如果我还活着，我会走在伦敦大桥上。”","“Every Sunday night, from eleven until the clock strikes twelve,” said the girl without hesitation, “I will walk on London Bridge if I am alive.”"
"“再等一下。”罗丝看到姑娘急匆匆地往门口走去，赶紧打断。“再为你自己想一想，好好考虑一下这个脱身的机会。你可以向我提出要求，不仅是因为你主动带来这个消息，更因为作为一个女人，你已经几乎迷失到没法改过自新了。只要一句话就能救你，你还要回到那群强盗、那个人身边吗？是什么魔法把你拉回去，让你紧抓着邪恶与苦难不放？哦！我无法触动你的心弦吗！没有留下一点儿我可以激发的东西，以打破这可怕的迷恋吗！”","“Stay another moment,” interposed Rose, as the girl moved hurriedly towards the door.“Think once again on your own condition, and the opportunity you have of escaping from it.You have a claim on me: not only as the voluntary bearer of this intelligence, but as a woman lost almost beyond redemption.Will you return to this gang of robbers, and to this man, when a word can save you?What fascination is it that can take you back, and make you cling to wickedness and misery?Oh! is there no chord in your heart that I can touch!Is there nothing left, to which I can appeal against this terrible infatuation!”"
"“每当像你这样年轻、善良又美丽的小姐，”姑娘坚定地回答道，“付出了真心，爱情就会带你到天涯海角——即使是像你这样有家、有朋友，还有其他倾慕者的人也一样，总要倾尽所有。像我这样只有块棺材板，甚至连个屋顶都没有的人，生病了或者要死时除了医院的护士，再没有朋友在身旁；而像我这样的人们，我们把腐烂的心随便给某个男人，让他来填满贯穿我们悲惨一生的空缺，还能指望谁来治愈我们呢？可怜我们吧，小姐——可怜可怜我们，因为我们只剩下女人这最后一丝的感情了，这感情本可以带来宽慰和骄傲，却因为冷漠的天意而变成了一种新的痛苦和折磨。”","“When ladies as young, and good, and beautiful as you are,” replied the girl steadily, “give away your hearts, love will carry you all lengths—even such as you, who have home, friends, other admirers, everything, to fill them.When such as I, who have no certain roof but the coffinlid, and no friend in sickness or death but the hospital nurse, set our rotten hearts on any man, and let him fill the place that has been a blank through all our wretched lives, who can hope to cure us?Pity us, lady—pity us for having only one feeling of the woman left, and for having that turned, by a heavy judgment, from a comfort and a pride, into a new means of violence and suffering.”"
"“你可以，”罗丝停顿了一下，说道，“从我这里拿点儿钱，也许可以使你不用再靠欺骗生活——起码直到我们再次见面？”","“You will,” said Rose, after a pause, “take some money from me, which may enable you to live without dishonesty—at all events until we meet again?”"
"“我一分钱也不会拿的。”姑娘摇着手回答道。","“Not a penny,” replied the girl, waving her hand."
"“不要对我想要帮助你而做出的所有努力关上心门。”罗丝温柔地上前一步，说道，“我是真心实意地想要帮助你。”","“Do not close your heart against all my efforts to help you,” said Rose, stepping gently forward.“I wish to serve you indeed.”"
"“要是你能立刻要了我的命，小姐，”姑娘搓着双手回答道，“就是对我最大的帮助了。因为今晚，我一想到自己的身份，就比以前更加感到悲伤。我一直生活在地狱里，要是死后能不进地狱就算是不简单的了。上帝保佑你，可爱的小姐，但愿我受了多少耻辱，你就得到多少幸福！”","“You would serve me best, lady,” replied the girl, wringing her hands, “if you could take my life at once; for I have felt more grief to think of what I am, to-night, than I ever did before, and it would be something not to die in the hell in which I have lived.God bless you, sweet lady, and send as much happiness on your head as I have brought shame on mine!”"
"这不幸的人一边说着，一边大声啜泣着，转身走了。这次不寻常的会面更像是一场转瞬即逝的梦，而不像是一件实实在在发生了的事情。罗丝·梅莱因它感到精疲力竭，她瘫倒在椅子上，努力想要从纷乱的想法中理出个头绪来。","Thus speaking, and sobbing aloud, the unhappy creature turned away; while Rose Maylie, overpowered by this extraordinary interview, which had more the semblance of a rapid dream than an actual occurrence, sank into a chair, and endeavoured to collect her wandering thoughts."
"第四十一章 有了这么多新的发现，表明意外总是接踵而来，正如总是祸不单行一样","CHAPTER XLI Containing fresh discoveries, and showing that suprises, like misfortunes, seldom come alone.   "
"她所面临的这次考验确实非同寻常，使她处境非常艰难。她极其渴望弄清楚奥利弗的身世之谜，而刚刚和她交谈的那个不幸的女子对她如此信赖，认为她是一个诚实可靠的姑娘，她不由得将这份信任看得神圣无比。她的言行打动了罗丝·梅莱的心，她爱这个在她保护之下的孩子，这种爱和她的期望交织在一起，几乎同样真挚和炽烈。她希望这个无家可归的女子能迷途知返、重塑希望。","Her situation was, indeed, one of no common trial and difficulty.While she felt the most eager and burning desire to penetrate the mystery in which Oliver’s history was enveloped, she could not but hold sacred the confidence which the miserable woman with whom she had just conversed, had reposed in her, as a young and guileless girl.Her words and manner had touched Rose Maylie’s heart; and, mingled with her love for her young charge, and scarcely less intense in its truth and fervour, was her fond wish to win the outcast back to repentance and hope."
"她们打算在伦敦只停留三天，然后启程前往一个远处的沿海地方，在那儿呆上几个星期。现在已是第一天的午夜时分。在其后的四十八个小时里，她会确定怎样的行动路线，又会如何行动呢？或者，她会如何使这次旅行延期，而又不会引起人们的纷纷猜测呢？","They purposed remaining in London only three days, prior to departing for some weeks to a distant part of the coast. It was now midnight of the first day.What course of action could she determine upon, which could be adopted in eight-and-forty hours?Or how could she postpone the journey without exciting suspicion?"
"罗斯伯力先生现在和她们在一起，并且接下来的两天里，他也将呆在她们身边。然而，罗丝深知这位品行不凡的绅士性情急躁，也能够十分清楚地预见，一旦她将那个再次抓走奥利弗的帮凶这样的事向他和盘托出，他会立即勃然大怒；到那时，她站在那个姑娘的立场上所做的任何辩解，在所有经历过这样的事的人看来都是不能接受的。这样的原因也使得在告诉梅莱夫人这件事情的时候，必须面面俱到、谨小慎微，但她的第一反应准是去找那位令人尊敬的医生商量这件事。至于求助法律顾问，即使她知道如何去求助，出于相同的原因，她几乎也不会加以考虑。有一次，她突然想到可以找哈里帮忙，但这个想法使她想起了他们最后一次分别的情形，似乎她不配让他回来——随着她一连串的沉思回忆，眼泪涌上了双眼——现在，他也许已经学会了怎么样忘记她，离开之后也许过得更加快乐了。","Mr. Losberne was with them, and would be for the next two days; but Rose was too well acquainted with the excellent gentleman’s impetuosity, and foresaw too clearly the wrath with which, in the first explosion of his indignation, he would regard the instrument of Oliver’s recapture, to trust him with the secret, when her representations in the girl’s behalf could be seconded by no experienced person.These were all reasons for the greatest caution and most circumspect behaviour in communicating it to Mrs. Maylie, whose first impulse would infallibly be to hold a conference with the worthy doctor on the subject.As to resorting to any legal adviser, even if she had known how to do so, it was scarcely to be thought of, for the same reason.Once the thought occurred to her of seeking assistance from Harry; but this awakened the recollection of their last parting, and it seemed unworthy of her to call him back, when—the tears rose to her eyes as she pursued this train of reflection—he might have by this time learnt to forget her, and to be happier away."
"万千思绪纷扰，种种办法在罗丝的脑海中依次出现，她一会儿倾向这种办法，一会儿倾向那种办法，一会儿又退缩不前，不知如何是好。就这样，她度过了一个焦灼不安的不眠之夜。第二天，她考虑再三，在走投无路之下，她最终还是决定去找哈里商量。","Disturbed by these different reflections; inclining now to one course and then to another, and again recoiling from all, as each successive consideration presented itself to her mind; Rose passed a sleepless and anxious night.After more communing with herself next day, she arrived at the desperate conclusion of consulting Harry."
"“如果他回到这里感到痛苦的话，”她心想，“那对我来说也是多么痛苦的一件事啊！”不过，也许他不会来，他可能会写信，或者，他人是来了，却故意不来见我——他离开的时候就是这样做的。我从没想到他会这样做，但这对我们双方都更好。”想到这一点，罗丝搁下笔，转过脸去，仿佛不愿让这张即将成为她使者的信笺看到她潸然泪下的样子。","“If it be painful to him,” she thought, “to come back here, how painful it will be to me!But perhaps he will not come; he may write, or he may come himself, and studiously abstain from meeting me—he did when he went away.I hardly thought he would; but it was better for us both.”And here Rose dropped the pen, and turned away, as though the very paper which was to be her messenger should not see her weep."
"她将同一支笔拿起又放下，这样的动作已经重复五十次了。她再三推敲这封信该怎样起头，却只字未写。这时，先前一直由贾尔斯先生护着，在街上散步的奥利弗气喘吁吁地冲进了房间，从他按捺不住的激动表情来看，似乎又有令人恐慌的事情即将发生。","She had taken up the same pen, and laid it down again fifty times, and had considered and reconsidered the first line of her letter without writing the first word, when Oliver, who had been walking in the streets, with Mr. Giles for a body-guard, entered the room in such breathless haste and violent agitation, as seemed to betoken some new cause of alarm."
"“发生什么事了，你这么慌张？”罗丝迎上前去问道。","“What makes you look so flurried?"" asked Rose, advancing to meet hin."
"“我不知道这是怎么了，我感觉好像快喘不过气来了。”男孩回答道，“哦，天哪！想想看，我终于要见到他了，你应该知道我对你们说的都是实话！”","“I hardly know how; I feel as if I should be choked,” replied the boy.“Oh dear!To think that I should see him at last, and you should be able to know that I have told you the truth!”"
"“我一直认为你对我们说的全是实话。”罗丝安慰他说，“但这是怎么回事？——你说的是谁呢？”","“I never thought you had told us anything but the truth,” said Rose, soothing him.“But what is this? —of whom do you speak?” "
"“我已经见到那位先生了，”奥利弗回答道，几乎说不出话来了，“就是过去对我很好的那位先生——布朗洛先生，我们常常说起的那位。”","“I have seen the gentleman,” replied Oliver, scarcely able to articulate, “the gentleman who was so good to me—Mr. Brownlow, that we have so often talked about.”"
"“在哪里？”罗丝问道。","“Where?” asked Rose."
"“他从一辆马车上下来，”奥利弗喜极而泣，回答道，“走进了一个房子。我没跟他说话——我根本没法跟他说话，因为他也没看见我，而我止不住地全身发抖，根本无法朝他走过去。但是贾尔斯替我打听了他是不是就住在那里，他们说是的。你看这儿，”奥利弗展开一张纸片，说道，“就是这里，他就住在这里——我马上就去那儿！哦，哎呀，哎呀呀！我再见到他、再听到他说话的时候，我该如何是好呢！”","“Getting out of a coach,” replied Oliver, shedding tears of delight, “and going into a house.I didn’t speak to him—I couldn’t speak to him, for he didn’t see me, and I trembled so, that I was not able to go up to him.But Giles asked, for me, whether he lived there, and they said he did.Look here,” said Oliver, opening a scrap of paper, “here it is; here’s where he lives—I’m going there directly!Oh, dear me, dear me!What shall I do when I come to see him and hear him speak again!”"
"奥利弗的这番话，夹杂着许多语无伦次的欢呼，将罗丝的注意力大大转移了。她看了一下地址，是斯特兰克雷文大街。她当即决定要利用这个发现。","With her attention not a little distracted by these and a great many other incoherent exclamations of joy, Rose read the address, which was Craven Street, in the Strand.She very soon determined upon turning the discovery to account."
"“快！”她说，“让他们雇一辆马车，准备好和我一起去。我这就带你去那儿，一分钟也不耽误。我只会告诉婶婶我们要出去一个钟头，你准备好了我们就走。”","“Quick!” she said.“Tell them to fetch a hackney-coach, and be ready to go with me.I will take you there directly, without a minute’s loss of time.I will only tell my aunt that we are going out for an hour, and be ready as soon as you are.”"
"奥利弗早已迫不及待，大约五分钟后，他们就启程前往克雷文大街了。到那儿之后，罗丝让奥利弗呆在马车里，借口说老先生接待他也需要准备准备；她让仆人递上她的名片，说有十分紧急的事情请求见一见布朗洛先生。仆人一会儿就回来了，并请她上楼。梅莱小姐随他来到楼上的一个房间，在那里见到了一位和蔼可亲的老先生，穿着一件深绿色的外套。离他不远的地方，坐着另外一位老先生，穿着淡黄色的马裤，裹着绑腿。他看上去并不太和善，坐在那儿，双手紧握在一根粗重的手杖顶部，并将下巴靠在上面。","Oliver needed no prompting to despatch, and in little more than five minutes they were on their way to Craven Street.When they arrived there, Rose left Oliver in the coach, under pretence of preparing the old gentleman to receive him; and sending up her card by the servant, requested to see Mr. Brownlow on very pressing business.The servant soon returned, to beg that she would walk upstairs; and following him into an upper room, Miss Maylie was presented to an elderly gentleman of benevolent appearance, in a bottle-green coat.At no great distance from whom, was seated another old gentleman, in nankeen breeches and gaiters; who did not look particularly benevolent, and who was sitting with his hands clasped on the top of a thick stick, and his chin propped thereupon."
"“哎呀，”身穿深绿色外套的先生急忙站起来，彬彬有礼地说，“请您原谅，小姐——我原以为是某个纠缠不休的人——望您见谅。请坐。”","“Dear me,” said the gentleman, in the bottle-green coat, hastily rising with great politeness, “I beg your pardon, young lady—I imagined it was some importunate person who—I beg you will excuse me.Be seated, pray.”"
"“我想，您就是布朗洛先生吧，对吗？” 罗丝说，匆匆看了一下另外一位先生，又将目光收回到刚才说话的那位身上。","“Mr. Brownlow, I believe, sir?” said Rose, glancing from the other gentleman to the one who had spoken."
"“正是在下。”老先生说，“这位是我的朋友，格林维格先生。格林维格，您不介意让我们单独呆几分钟吧？”","“That is my name,” said the old gentleman.“This is my friend, Mr. Grimwig.Grimwig, will you leave us for a few minutes?”"
"“以我之见，”梅莱小姐插话说，“我们谈话的时候，不必麻烦那位先生回避。如果我所闻无误的话，他应该知晓我要与您谈的事情。”","“I believe,” interposed Miss Maylie, “that at this period of our interview, I need not give that gentleman the trouble of going away.If I am correctly informed, he is cognizant of the business on which I wish to speak to you.”"
"布朗洛先生点了点头。格林维格先生刚刚僵硬地鞠了一躬，已从座位上站了起来，现在又僵硬地鞠了一躬，一下子坐了回去。","Mr. Brownlow inclined his head.Mr. Grimwig, who had made one very stiff bow, and risen from his chair, made another very stiff bow, and dropped into it again."
"“毫无疑问，我会让您大吃一惊，”罗丝说道，不由得觉得有些尴尬，“但您曾经对我的一个非常可爱的小朋友尽善尽德，我相信您会有兴趣再次听听他的事。”","“I shall surprise you very much, I have no doubt,” said Rose, naturally embarrassed; “but you once showed great benevolence and goodness to a very dear young friend of mine, and I am sure you will take an interest in hearing of him again.”"
"“确实不假！”布朗洛先生说。","“Indeed!” said Mr. Brownlow."
"“他叫奥利弗·特威斯特，您是知道的。”罗丝回答道。","“Oliver Twist you knew him as,” replied Rose."
"话才刚刚说出口，一直假装翻阅放在桌上的一本大书的格林维格先生就把书给掀翻了，发出巨大的声响；他向后一仰，靠在椅背上，除了十足的惊愕外，脸上没有任何表情，他眼神茫然，愣了好久。随后，他似乎因为自己的情绪过分暴露而感到难为情，于是，他猛然一动，恢复了先前的姿态，两眼直视前方，向外望去；他发出了一声悠长而低沉的口哨，最后，口哨声似乎不是消散在空洞的空气中，而是渐渐消失在他胃部最深处的地方。","The words no sooner escaped her lips, than Mr. Grimwig, who had been affecting to dip into a large book that lay on the table, upset it with a great crash, and falling back in his chair, discharged from his features every expression but one of unmitigated wonder, and indulged in a prolonged and vacant stare;then, as if ashamed of having betrayed so much emotion, he jerked himself, as it were, by a convulsion into his former attitude, and looking out straight before him emitted a long deep whistle, which seemed, at last, not to be discharged on empty air, but to die away in the innermost recesses of his stomach."
"布朗洛先生也很惊愕，但他没有通过这种古怪的方式表现出来。他把椅子向梅莱小姐那边挪了挪，说：“帮帮忙，我亲爱的小姐，再也不要提及您所说的尽善尽德，也没有其他人知道这些。如果您能够出示任何证据，可以改变我曾经对那个可怜孩子的不佳印象，看在上帝的份上，让我看看您的证据吧。”","Mr. Browlow was no less surprised, although his astonishment was not expressed in the same eccentric manner.He drew his chair nearer to Miss Maylie’s, and said, “Do me the favour, my dear young lady, to leave entirely out of the question that goodness and benevolence of which you speak, and of which nobody else knows anything; and if you have it in your power to produce any evidence which will alter the unfavourable opinion I was once induced to entertain of that poor child, in Heaven’s name put me in possession of it.”"
"“一个坏小子！如果他不是一个坏小子的话，我就不是人。”格林维格先生吼道，他是用某种腹语在说话，因为他脸上的肌肉一丝不动。","“A bad one!I’ll eat my head if he is not a bad one,” growled Mr. Grimwig, speaking by some ventriloquial power, without moving a muscle of his face."
"“这个孩子品质高尚，有一副热心肠。”罗丝说，脸有些发红，“神授意要让他承受本不该在他这个年龄承受的磨难，在他的心中种下了爱和感情，这种爱和感情即使对许多比他年长六倍的人来说也是可以引以为豪的事情。”","“He is a child of a noble nature and a warm heart,” said Rose, colouring; “and that Power which has thought fit to try him beyond his years, has planted in his breast affections and feelings which would do honour to many who have numbered his days six times over.”"
"“我才六十一岁。”格林维格先生说，面部表情依然很僵硬。“而且，这个奥利弗少说也有十二岁了，这件事真是见鬼了，我不明白你说的话是什么意思。”","“I’m only sixty-one,” said Mr. Grimwig, with the same rigid face.“And, as the devil’s in it if this Oliver is not twelve years old at least, I don’t see the application of that remark.”"
"“千万别把我朋友的话放在心上，梅莱小姐，”布朗洛先生说，“他说的不是那个意思。”","“Do not heed my friend, Miss Maylie,” said Mr. Brownlow; “he does not mean what he says.”"
"“是的，就是那个意思。”格林维格先生低声吼道。","“Yes, he does,” growled Mr. Grimwig."
"“不，不是那个意思。”布朗洛先生说，显然越说越生气了。","“No, he does not,” said Mr. Brownlow, obviously rising in wrath as he spoke."
"“如果不是那个意思，他就不是人。”格林维格先生怒吼道。","“He’ll eat his head, if he doesn’t,” growled Mr. Grimwig."
"“如果是的话，真应该敲掉他的脑袋。”布朗洛先生说。","“He would deserve to have it knocked off, if he does,” said Mr. Brownlow."
"“他倒十分想看看谁会这么做。”格林维格先生边回答边用他的手杖敲打着地板。","“And he’d uncommonly like to see any man offer to do it,” responded Mr. Grimwig, knocking his stick upon the floor."
"事情有些过头了，这两位老先生好几次大为光火，随后又握手言和，这是他们之间永不会改变的习惯。","Having gone thus far, the two old gentlemen severally took snuff, and afterwards shook hands, according to their invariable custom."
"“好了，梅莱小姐，”布朗洛先生说，“让我们回到主题上来吧，就是那个吸引您慈悲和善良的主题。您能告诉我这个可怜孩子的一些情况吗？请允许我说两句，我发誓，为了找到他，我费尽周折。他曾被他以前的同伙唆使来我这里想捞点儿好处，但自从我去国外之后，我对他的第一印象已经有很大的动摇了。”","“Now, Miss Maylie,” said Mr. Brownlow, “to return to the subject in which your humanity is so much interested.Will you let me know what intelligence you have of this poor child: allowing me to promise that I exhausted every means in my power of discovering him, and that since I have been absent from this country, my first impression that he had imposed upon me, and had been persuaded by his former associates to rob me, has been considerably shaken.”"
"罗丝事先已理清了她的思绪，三两句话就讲述了奥利弗离开布朗洛先生家之后发生的事情，不过她保留了南希的消息，想私下告诉这位先生。最后，她十分确信地说，奥利弗在过去的几个月中唯一感到悲伤的事情就是无法见到他过去的恩人和朋友。","Rose, who had had time to collect her thoughts, at once related, in a few natural words, all that had befallen Oliver since he left Mr. Brownlow’s house; reserving Nancy’s information for that gentleman’s private ear, and concluding with the assurance that his only sorrow, for some months past, had been not being able to meet with his former benefactor and friend."
"“谢天谢地！”老先生说，“我真是太开心了，太开心了。但您还没告诉我，如今他人在哪里，梅莱小姐。请您一定要原谅我对您的指责，——但是您为什么不带他一起来呢？”","“Thank God!” said the old gentleman.“This is great happiness to me, great happiness.But you have not told me where he is now, Miss Maylie.You must pardon my finding fault with you,—but why not have brought him?”"
"“他正在门外的一辆马车里等着。”罗丝回答道。","“He is waiting in a coach at the door,” replied Rose."
"“就在这个门外！”老先生大叫一声。","“At this door!” cried the old gentleman."
"话音未落，他就急匆匆地走出了房间，直奔楼下，踩上马车踏板，二话不说就钻进了马车。","With which he hurried out of the room, down the stairs, up the coachsteps, and into the coach, without another word."
"房门在他身后关上之后，格林维格先生抬起头，用后面的一条椅腿做支撑，借助他的手杖和桌子，坐在椅子里转了整整三圈。表演完这一转体动作之后，他站了起来，跛着脚，来来回回在屋子里走了不下十二次，然后他突然停住，没有任何预兆地吻了罗丝。","When the room-door closed behind him, Mr. Grimwig lifted up his head, and converting one of the hind legs of his chair into a pivot, described three distinct circles with the assistance of his stick and the table; sitting in it all the time.After performing this evolution, he rose and limped as fast as he could up and down the room at least a dozen times, and then stopping suddenly before Rose, kissed her without the slightest preface."
"“安静！”他说，此时这位年轻的女士已经因为这不寻常的举止而警觉地站了起来。“别怕。我年纪大得都可以当你爷爷了。你是个可爱的女孩。我喜欢你。他们来了！”","“Hush!” he said, as the young lady rose in some alarm at this unusual proceeding.“Don’t be afraid.I’m old enough to be your grandfather.You’re a sweet girl.I like you.Here they are!”"
"实际上，他刚快步坐回原先的位子，布朗洛先生就带着奥利弗一起回来了，格林维格先生非常彬彬有礼地欢迎他们；而且，如果此刻的喜悦是罗丝对奥利弗的担心和惦念所得到的唯一回报的话，罗丝也觉得收获颇丰了。","In fact, as he threw himself at one dexterous dive into his former seat, Mr. Brownlow returned, accompanied by Oliver, whom Mr. Grimwig received very graciously; and if the gratification of that moment had been the only reward for all her anxiety and care in Oliver’s behalf, Rose Maylie would have been well repaid."
"“对了对了，还有个人不该被忘了。”布朗洛先生摇响了铃，说道，“劳驾把贝德温太太请到这儿来。”","“There is somebody else who should not be forgotten, by the bye,” said Mr. Brownlow, ringing the bell.“Send Mrs. Bedwin here, if you please.”"
"老管家匆匆赶来，在门口行了礼，然后待命。","The old housekeeper answered the summons with all dispatch; and dropping a curtsey at the door, waited for orders."
"“为什么，你的眼神一天比一天糟糕，贝德温。”布朗洛先生问道，口气听起来相当气恼。","“Why, you get blinder every day, Bedwin,” said Mr. Brownlow, rather testily."
"“恩，是啊，先生。”老太太答道，“人的视力，到了我这个岁数，是不会随着年龄再提高了，先生。”","“Well, that I do, sir,” replied the old lady.“People’s eyes, at my time of life, don’t improve with age, sir.”"
"“我早就跟你说过，”布朗洛先生又说，“但你怎么不戴上眼镜啊，看看能不能明白为什么叫你过来，看看？”","“I could have told you that,” rejoined Mr. Brownlow; “but put on your glasses, and see if you can’t find out what you were wanted for, will you?”"
"老太太开始在她的衣服口袋里翻找眼镜。但是奥利弗可没耐心再经受这个新的考验，他还是屈服于自己最初的冲动，立即跑过去扑到老太太怀里。","The old lady began to rummage in her pocket for her spectacles.But Oliver’s patience was not proof against this new trial; and yielding to his first impulse, he sprang into her arms."
"“我的天啊！”老太太哭着，抱着他，“这是我那无辜的孩子啊！”","“God be good to me!” cried the old lady, enbracing him; “it is my innconent boy!”"
"“亲爱的奶妈！”奥利弗哭道。","“My dear old nurse!”cried Oliver."
"“他会回来的——我就知道他会的。”老太太说着，把他抱在怀里，“瞧他看起来气色多好，穿得多像个公子哥啊！这么长时间你去哪儿了呀？啊！还是这么秀气的脸蛋，但是没有那么苍白了；还是这么温柔的眼睛，但是没有那么忧伤了。我从没忘记过这些，也从没忘记过他温和的微笑，我每天就这样看着，总是拿这些跟我自己那几个可爱孩子做比较，我那些可爱的孩子们在我还年轻的时候就离我远去了。”老太太就这么一直说着，一会儿让奥利弗退一步量量他长高了多少，一会儿握着他双手，宠爱地摸摸他的头发，就这么搂着他的脖子哭着，笑着。","“He would come back—I knew he would,” said the old lady, holding him in her arms.“How well he looks, and how like a gentleman’s son he is dressed again!Where have you been, this long, long while?Ah! the same sweet face, but not so pale; the same soft eye, but not so sad.I have never forgotten them or his quiet smile, but have seen them every day, side by side with those of my own dear children, dead and gone since I was a lightsome young creature.”Running on thus, and now holding Oliver from her to mark how he had grown, now clasping him to her and passing her fingers fondly through his hair, the good soul laughed and wept upon his neck by turns."
"布朗洛先生走开了，以便她和奥利弗叙旧，带着罗丝去了另外一间屋子。在那里，他听罗丝完整地讲述了她和南希的见面经过，这使得他极为震惊同时又忐忑不安。罗丝也解释了她为什么没有第一时间向她的朋友罗斯伯力先生坦诚相告的理由。老先生认为她做得非常谨慎，随即毫不迟疑地答应前去跟那位令人敬佩的医生进行一次正式的会谈。为了能让他早些完成这次计划，他们安排当天晚上八点由他去旅店进行一次拜访，同时也将详细地告知梅莱夫人发生的所有事情。这些准备措施一切安排妥当后，罗丝和奥利弗便返回家去了。","Leaving her and Oliver to compare notes at leisure, Mr. Brownlow led the way into another room; and there, heard from Rose a full narration of her interview with Nancy, which occasioned him no little surprise and perplexity.Rose also explained her reasons for not confiding in her friend Mr. Losberne in the first instance.The old gentleman considered that she had acted prudently, and readily undertook to hold solemn conference with the worthy doctor himself.To afford him an early opportunity for the execution of this design, it was arranged that he should call at the hotel at eight o’clock that evening, and that in the meantime Mrs. Maylie should be cautiously informed of all that had occurred.These preliminaries adjusted, Rose and Oliver returned home."
"罗丝绝对没有高估那位善良的医生发起火来是什么样子。刚向他说明南希的来历，他的嘴中就不停地涌出一番威胁和诅咒，还扬言说要通过布拉瑟斯先生和达夫先生的全力配合，把南希第一个抓起来。然后他戴上帽子，准备立即去请那些人帮忙。此时，毫无疑问，在一时兴起的刺激下，他会把这个想法付诸实际，一点儿也不会考虑后果。所幸的是他被阻止了，一方面是由于布朗洛先生以相同的强烈态度加以阻拦，他本身也是这种急脾气，另一方面是因为大家提出各种争论和意见，用这样的方法来打消那些冲动的想法最有效了。","Rose had by no means overrated the measure of the good doctor’s wrath.Nancy’s history was no sooner unfolded to him, than he poured forth a shower of mingled threats and execrations; threatened to make her the first victim of the combined ingenuity of Messrs. Blathers and Duff;and actually put on his hat preparatory to sallying forth to obtain the assistance of those worthies.And, doubtless, he would, in this first outbreak, have carried the intention into effect without a moment’s consideration of the consequences, if he had not been restrained, in part, by corresponding violence on the side of Mr. Brownlow, who was himself of an irascible temperament, and party by such arguments and representations as seemed best calculated to dissuade him from his hotbrained purpose."
"“然后呢，到底怎么办呀？”当他们与两位女士会合时，医生又不加思索地问道，“难道我们要通过一项法案，来感谢所有的那些流氓，不管是男的还是女的，恳求他们接受我们一百镑左右的报酬，就当是我们的些许敬意，以及感谢他们善待了奥利弗呢？”","“Then what the devil is to be done?” said the impetuous doctor, when they had rejoined the two ladies.“Are we to pass a vote of thanks to all these vagabonds, male and female, and beg them to accept a hundred pounds, or so, apiece, as a trifling mark of our esteem, and some slight acknowledgment of their kindness to Oliver?”"
"“不全是这样，”布朗洛先生说道，笑了笑，“但是我们必须得事事小心。”","“Not exactly that,” rejoined Mr. Brownlow, laughing; “but we must proceed gently and with great care.”"
"“事事小心，”医生叫嚷着，“我要把他们都送到——”“不用考虑送到哪儿，”布朗洛先生打断了他，“但是要思考思考，是不是把他们送到某个地方，就达到了我们原有的目的。”","“Gentleness and care,” exclaimed the doctor.“I’d send them one and all to—” “Never mind where,” interposed Mr. Brownlow.“But reflect whether sending them anywhere is likely to attain the object we have in view.”"
"“什么目的？”医生问。","“What object?”asked the doctor."
"“非常简单，弄清楚奥利弗的身世，再帮助他把属于他的遗产要回来；如果这个事情是真实的，那么说明他的这些遗产已经被人用不正当的手段骗走了啊。”","“Simply, the discovery of Oliver’s parentage, and regaining for him the inheritance of which, if this story be true, he has been fraudulently deprived.”"
"“啊！”罗斯伯力先生用小手巾擦擦脸，让自己冷静，说，“我几乎把这个给忘了。”","“Ah!” said Mr. Losberne, cooling himself with his pocket-handkerchief; “I almost forgot that.”"
"“你看啊，”布朗洛先生继续说，“先不考虑这位可怜的姑娘，假如说能够把这些坏蛋诉诸法律并且可以避免伤害到她，我们能得到什么好处？”","“You see,” pursued Mr. Brownlow; “placing this poor girl entirely out of the question, and supposing it were possible to bring these scoundrels to justice without compromising her safety, what good should we bring about?”"
"“至少要把其中一些人绞死，”医生建议说，“并且要把其他的都遣送。”","“Hanging a few of them at least, in all probability,” suggested the doctor, “and transporting the rest.”"
"“非常好，”布朗洛先生笑着答道，“但是他们早晚会受到惩罚的，如果我们涉足抢先会怎么样，只会做出非常可笑的事情，这与我们自己的利益——或者至少是奥利弗的利益大相径庭，其实这就是同一件事。”","“Very good,” replied Mr. Brownlow, smiling; “but no doubt they will bring that about for themselves in the fulness of time, and if we step in to forestall them, it seems to me that we shall be performing a very Quixotic act, in direct opposition to our own interest—or at least to Oliver’s, which is the same thing.”"
"“那怎么办？”医生询问说。","“How?” inquired the doctor."
"“因此，非常明确，如果说要弄明白这个秘密，我们会面对极大的困难，除非我们能让这个叫蒙克斯的人乖乖就范。这只能通过智谋实现，只有在他没有跟那些同党在一起的时候抓住他。因为，假如他已经被逮捕，我们又没有证据证明他有罪的话。他甚至（正如我们所知，或者摆在我们面前的事实）会被认为没有参与到这帮坏蛋的任何一次抢劫中。即使他没有被放出来，他也不大可能再受到什么惩罚，也就是当作流浪汉、混混关几天监狱，这样我们以后也别想从他那里问出什么，他会装聋作哑、装瞎子，再装成一个白痴。”","“Thus.It is quite clear that we shall have extreme difficulty in getting to the bottom of this mystery, unless we can bring this man, Monks, upon his knees.That can only be done by stratagem, and by catching him when he is not surrounded by these people.For, suppose he were apprehended, we have no proof against him.He is not even (so far as we know, or as the facts appear to us) concerned with the gang in any of their robberies.If he were not discharged, it is very unlikely that he could receive any further punishment than being committed to prison as a rogue and vagabond; and of course ever afterwards his mouth would be so obstinately closed that he might as well, for our purposes, be deaf, dumb, blind, and an idiot.”"
"“然后呢，”医生着急地问，“我再问你，你是否坚持认为对那位姑娘的承诺是合情合理的，是出于最真诚和最善良的意愿所作出的承诺，但实际上——”“不要讨论这个问题，我亲爱的小姐。”罗丝正打算说话的时候，布朗洛先生打断了她，“这个承诺必定会遵守。我相信我们的行动不会因此而受到妨碍。但是，在我们能采取任何具体措施之前，我们必须去看看那位姑娘，以确保她是否愿意指认蒙克斯，也就是说告诉她蒙克斯是由我们来处置，而不是通过法律；或者，如果她不愿意，或者不能那么做的话，可以问她蒙克斯常去什么地方，是个什么样的人，以便我们能够认出他。在周日晚上之前是找不她的，今天是周二。同时，我建议我们最好保持绝对冷静，保守秘密，甚至对奥利弗本人。”","“Then,” said the doctor impetuously, “I put it to you again, whether you think it reasonable that this promise to the girl should be considered binding; a promise made with the best and kindest intentions, but really—” “Do not discuss the point, my dear young lady, pray,” said Mr. Brownlow, interrupting Rose as she was about to speak.“The promise shall be kept.I don’t think it will, in the slightest degree, interfere with our proceedings.But, before we can resolve upon any precise course of action, it will be necessary to see the girl; to ascertain from her whether she will point out this Monks, on the understanding that he is to be dealt with by us, and not by the law;or, if she will not, or cannot do that, to procure from her such an account of his haunts and description of his person, as will enable us to identify him.She cannot be seen until next Sunday night; this is Tuesday.I would suggest that in the meantime, we remain perfectly quiet, and keep these matters secret even from Oliver himself.”"
"尽管罗斯伯力先生对接受这个拖延五天的提议，做了很多怪表情，但他还是勉强承认这个时候没有更好的办法了；而且因为罗丝和梅莱夫人也坚决地站在布朗洛先生的那边，这样这位老先生的提议被一致通过了。","Although Mr. Losberne received with many wry faces a proposal involving a delay of five whole days, he was fain to admit that no better course occurred to him just then; and as both Rose and Mrs. Maylie sided very strongly with Mr. Brownlow, that gentleman’s proposition was carried unanimously."
"“我愿意，”布朗洛说，“去找我朋友格林维格帮忙。他是个奇怪的人，但是却很精明，也许能给我们点儿实际的帮助；我想说一下，他是个律师，因为二十年里只收到一件案情摘要和诉讼请求，他一怒之下便退出了这个行业，不知道这算不算建议，你们还是自己决定吧。”","“I should like,” he said, “to call in the aid of my friend Grimwig.He is a strange creature, but a shrewd one, and might prove of material assistance to us; I should say that he was bred a lawyer, and quitted the Bar in disgust because he had only one brief and a motion of course, in twenty years, though whether that is recommendation or not, you must determine for yourselves.”"
"“如果我能叫我的朋友来，那么你叫你的朋友来，我就没有意见。”医生说。","“I have no objection to your calling in your friend if I may call in mine,” said the doctor."
"“我们必须投票决定，”布朗洛先生答道，“他是谁呢？”","“We must put it to the vote,” replied Mr. Brownlow, “who may he be?”"
"“是那位女士的儿子，这位年轻女士的——老朋友。”医生说着，指了指梅莱夫人，最后又意味深长地看了一眼她的侄女。","“That lady’s son, and this young lady’s—very old friend,” said the doctor, motioning towards Mrs. Maylie, and concluding with an expressive glance at her niece."
"罗丝脸通红，却也没有提出任何异议（可能她觉得反对的也只是少数）；因此哈里·梅莱和格林维格先生也自然而然地加入了。","Rose blushed deeply, but she did not make any audible objection to this motion (possibly she felt in a hopeless minority); and Harry Maylie and Mr. Grimwig were accordingly added to the committee."
"“当然，我们会一直在镇上。”梅莱夫人说，“只要还有一丝希望，就有机会顺利地把这个调查继续下去。对于我们大家都如此深切关心的问题，我不怕麻烦，也不会计较开支，只要能呆在这里，我也知足，就算是一年，只要你们能让我相信事情还是有希望的。","“We stay in town, of course,” said Mrs. Maylie, “while there remains the slightest prospect of prosecuting this inquiry with a chance of success.I will spare neither trouble nor expense in behalf of the object in which we are all so deeply interested, and I am content to remain here, if it be for twelve months, so long as you assure me that any hope remains.”"
"“好！”布朗洛先生应道，","“Good!” rejioned Mr.Brownlow."
"“我看大家的神情，好像都想知道我怎么会突然出国，导致需要我证明奥利弗事情的时候却找不到，让我事先讲明，到我认为合适的时候，我自然会告诉诸位，不劳大家来问我。相信我，我这样做绝对是有理由的，不然我可能也会产生一些注定没法实现的希望，只会增加本来就不计其数的困难和失望。好了！已经可以开始用晚餐了，还有，一直单独呆在隔壁屋的小奥利弗，这会儿会开始想我们是不是不喜欢他了，正在密谋什么毒计要将他赶出这里呢。”","“And as I see on the faces about me, a disposition to inquire how it happened that I was not in the way to corroborate Oliver’s tale, and had so suddenly left the kingdom, let me stipulate that I shall be asked no questions until such time as I may deem it expedient to forestall them by telling my own story.Believe me, I make this request with good reason, for I might otherwise excite hopes destined never to be realised, and only increase difficulties and disappointments already quite numerous enough.Come!Supper has been announced, and young Oliver, who is all alone in the next room, will have begun to think, by this time, that we have wearied of his company, and entered into some dark conspiracy to thrust him forth upon the world.”"
"说完这些，老先生向梅莱夫人伸出手，陪她走进餐厅。罗斯伯力先生跟在后面，领着罗丝。目前，讨论会到此暂时告一段落了。","With these words, the old gentleman gave his hand to Mrs. Maylie, and escorted her into the supper-room.Mr. Losberne followed, leading Rose; and the council was, for the present, effectually broken up."
"第四十二章 奥利弗的一个老熟人展示出极高的天赋，在首都成了一个公众人物","CHAPTER XLII An old acquaintance of Oliver’s, exhibiting decided marks of genius, becomes a public character in the metropolis "
"晚上，南希把赛克斯先生哄睡着了之后，急急忙忙地赶到罗丝·梅莱那里，去完成她自己揽上身的任务。此时，在北方大道上，有两个人正向着伦敦走来，这本传记最好还是应当对他们有所关注。","Upon the night when Nancy, having lulled Mr. Sikes to sleep, hurried on her self-imposed mission to Rose Maylie, there advanced towards London, by the Great North Road, two persons, upon whom it is expedient that this history should bestow some attention."
"那两人是一位先生和一位太太，或者倒不如说成是一男一女，因为前者四肢修长、膝盖外翻、步履蹒跚，而且还骨瘦如柴，这种人不易看出其确切的年纪——当他们还是小男孩时就是这个样子了，像是个发育不完全的男人；而当他们接近成年时，则更像是个大孩子。那女人年轻些，长得结实有力，因此她不得不承担那拴在背上的、沉重的包袱。她的同伴并没有提多少行李，只有一个用普通手帕包起来的小包裹，显然十分轻巧，悬吊在扛在肩头上的一根手杖上。在这种情况下，加上他的两条腿异常修长，男人总能轻轻松松地就超过他的同伴六七步；他时不时回头，不耐烦地摇头望着女人，好像在责怪她又落后了，并催促她再加把劲。","They were a man and woman; or perhaps they would be better described as a male and female: for the former was one of those long-limbed, knock-kneed, shambling, bony people, to whom it is difficult to assign any precise age,—looking as they do, when they are yet boys, like undergrown men, and when they are almost men, like overgrown boys.The woman was young, but of a robust and hardy make, as she need have been to bear the weight of the heavy bundle which was strapped to her back.Her companion was not encumbered with much luggage, as there merely dangled from a stick which he carried over his shoulder, a small parcel wrapped in a common handkerchief, and apparently light enough.This circumstance, added to the length of his legs, which were of unusual extent, enabled him with much ease to keep some half-dozen paces in advance of his companion, to whom he occasionally turned with an impatient jerk of the head: as if reproaching her tardiness, and urging her to greater exertion."
"就这样，他们在尘土飞扬的大道上吃力地走着，对眼前的一切全不在意，只有当城里来的邮车疾驰而过时，他们才站到一旁，给邮车让出路来；他们这样走着，一直穿过高门拱道，这时，走在前面的那位停下脚步，对他的同伴不耐烦地喊道：“快点儿，你就不能走快点儿吗？你真是懒骨头，夏洛特。”","Thus, they had toiled along the dusty road, taking little heed of any object within sight, save when they stepped aside to allow a wider passage for the mail-coaches which were whirling out of town, until they passed through Highgate archway; when the foremost traveller stopped and called impatiently to his companion, “Come on, can’t yer?What a lazybones yer are, Charlotte.”"
"“跟你说吧，这包袱太重了。”女人说着，赶了上来，累得几乎喘不过气来。","“It’s a heavy load, I can tell you,” said the female, coming up, almost breathless with fatigue."
"“重！你说什么呐？你是干什么用的？”男人一边说，一边把他那小小的包裹换到另一个肩膀上。“哦，你又来了，又要休息！好吧，你除了能让所有人失去耐心，我就真不知道你还能做些什么！”","“Heavy!What are yer talking about?What are yer made for?” rejoined the male traveller, changing his own little bundle as he spoke, to the other shoulder.“Oh, there yer are, resting again!Well, if yer ain’t enough to tire anybody’s patience out, I don’t know what is!”"
"“还有很远吗？”女人问道，靠着路边坐下来休息。她抬起头来，脸上汗如雨下。","“Is it much farther?” asked the woman, resting herself against a bank, and looking up with the perspiration streaming from her face."
"“很远？我们差不多就要到了。”长腿徒步旅行者指着前方说，“看那儿！那就是伦敦的灯光了。”","“Much farther!Yer as good as there,” said the long-legged tramper, pointing out before him.“Look there!Those are the lights of London.”"
"“至少还有足足两英里远呢。”女人沮丧地说，","“They’re a good two mile off, at least,” said the woman despondingly."
"“别管是两英里还是二十英里，”诺亚·克雷波尔说，“赶紧起身上路，不然我要踢你起来了，我可是事先打过招呼了。”","“Never mind whether they’re two mile off, or twenty,” said Noah Claypole; for he it was; “but get up and come on, or I’ll kick yer, and so I give yer notice.”"
"诺亚一生气，他那红色的鼻头就变得更红了，他边说着边走过马路来，好像真准备要动手似的，女人没再说什么就起来了，在他身边步履艰难地走着。","As Noah’s red nose grew redder with anger, and as he crossed the road while speaking, as if fully prepared to put his threat into execution, the woman rose without any further remark, and trudged onward by his side."
"“你准备在哪儿停下过夜，诺亚？”他们走出了几百码远后，她问道。","“Where do you mean to stop for the night, Noah?” she asked, after they had walked a few hundred yards."
"“我怎么知道？”诺亚回答，因为长时间走路，他的脾气变得很坏。","“How should I know?” replied Noah, whose temper had been considerably impaired by walking."
"“我希望就在附近。”夏洛特说。","“Near, I hope,” said Charlotte."
"“不，不在附近。”克雷波尔先生回答，“听着！不在附近，别再想了。”","“No, not near,” replied Mr. Claypole.“There!Not near; so don’t think it.”"
"“为什么不？”","“Why not?”"
"“如果我告诉你我不想这么做，我就是不想，这足够了，没有什么为什么，也没有原因。”克雷波尔先生盛气凌人地说道。","“When I tell yer that I don’t mean to do a thing, that’s enough, without any why or because either,” replied Mr. Claypole with dignity."
"“好吧，你也犯不着这么生气。”他的同伴说。","“Well, you needn’t be so cross,” said his companion."
"“如果我们在城外遇到的第一个旅馆住下，那苏尔伯雷就可以来插上一脚；如果他在跟踪我们的话，他会给我们带上手铐，装在大车里抓回去，那可就好看了。”克雷波尔先生用一种奚落的口吻说着，“不！我一定要找一条我能够找到的最窄的巷子，走进去就看不见人了，而且还要一直走，直到我见到一家最偏僻的旅馆才停下来。你真该感谢自己的运气，我还算有点儿头脑；如果我们不是一开始故意走错路，再穿过田地走回去，你一个星期前就已经给牢牢地锁起来了，我的小姐。你也真该给关起来，谁让你是个傻瓜呢。”","“A pretty thing it would be, wouldn’t it to go and stop at the very first public-house outside the town, so that Sowerberry, if he come up after us, might poke in his old nose, and have us taken back in a cart with handcuffs on,” said Mr. Claypole in a jeering tone.“No!I shall go and lose myself among the narrowest streets I can find, and not stop till we come to the very out—of— the— wayest house I can set eyes on.“Cod, yer may thanks yer stars I’ve got a head; for if we hadn’t gone, at first, the wrong road a purpose, and come back across country, yer’d have been locked up hard and fast a week ago, my lady.And serve yer right for being a fool.”"
"“我知道我不如你聪明，”夏洛特回答，“但是也别全都怪在我身上呀，还说我会被关起来。我要是给关了起来，你也别想跑，不管怎么说。”","“I know I ain’t as cunning as you are,” replied Charlotte; “but don’t put all the blame on me, and say I should have been locked up.You would have been if I had been, any way.”"
"“是你从抽屉里拿了钱，你知道那是你做的。”克雷波尔先生说。","“Yer took the money from the till, yer know yer did,” said Mr. Claypole."
"“我是为了你才拿的，诺亚，亲爱的。”夏洛特接着说。","“I took it for you, Noah, dear,” rejoined Charlotte."
"“那么钱一直放在我这里了吗？”克雷波尔先生问。","“Did I keep it?” asked Mr. Claypole."
"“没有。你相信我，让我带在身上，就像个宝贝一样，你也是我的宝贝。”女人说着，摸了摸他的下巴，挽起他的胳膊。","“No; you trusted in me, and let me carry it like a dear, and so you are,” said the lady, chucking him under the chin, and drawing her arm through his."
"事实上确实是这么回事，但是克雷波尔先生从来没有盲目而愚蠢地相信任何人的习惯。应当公正地说一句，这位绅士这般信任夏洛特，为的是如果他们给逮住了，钱也是在她身上，这样他就有借口在面临任何偷窃的指控前证明自己的清白，从而使他有极大机会逃脱。当然，在这一刻，他还不想表明自己的动机，于是两人亲密无间地并排走着。","This was indeed the case; but as it was not Mr. Claypole’s habit to repose a blind and foolish confidence in anybody, it should be observed, in justice to that gentleman, that he had trusted Charlotte to this extent, in order that, if they were pursued, the money might be found on her: which would leave him an opportunity of asserting his innocence of any theft, and would greatly facilitate his chances of escape.Of course, he entered at this juncture, into no explanation of his motives, and they walked on very lovingly together."
"照着这个谨慎的计划行事，克雷波尔先生一刻不停地走着，直到来到伊斯灵顿区附近的安琪儿酒店。凭着对行人以及车辆数目的明智判断，他认定他们已经到达伦敦城了。","In pursuance of this cautious plan, Mr. Claypole went on, without halting, until he arrived at the Angel at Islington, where he wisely judged, from the crowd of passengers and numbers of vehicles, that London began in earnest."
"他停下脚步，观察着哪些街最为拥挤，因此那也就是最要避开的道大道。他穿过马路来到圣约翰路，一转眼身影就隐没在错综复杂、肮脏不堪的小路中。小路位于格雷旅馆胡同和伦敦肉市之间，是伦敦中部因为改建而遗留下来的最破、最烂的地区之一。","Just pausing to observe which appeared the most crowded streets, and consequently the most to be avoided, he crossed into Saint John’s Road, and was soon deep in the obscurity of the intricate and dirty ways, which, lying between Gray’s Inn Lane and Smithfield, render that part of the town one of the lowest and worst that improvement has left in the midst of London."
"诺亚·克雷波尔走过这些街巷，夏洛特跟在后面；他时而跨进路边的沟里，打量一眼某家小旅店的整体外观；时而又慢悠悠地向前走去，好像某种想象出的景象使他觉得店里旅客过多，不合他意。最终，他在一家旅馆门前停住了脚步，这家店是他所见过的最简陋也最肮脏的一家；他又走到街对面好好地观察了一下，然后郑重地宣布他们今晚就在这里过夜。","Through these streets, Noah Claypole walked, dragging Charlotte after him; now stepping into the kennel to embrace at a glance the whole external character of some small public-house; now jogging on again, as some fancied appearance induced him to believe it too public for his purpose.At length, he stopped in front of one, more humble in appearance and more dirty than any he had yet seen; and, having crossed over and surveyed it from the opposite pavement, graciously announced his intention of putting up there, for the night."
"“给我包袱，”诺亚一边说，一边从女人肩上解下包袱扛在自己背上，“别说话，等我让你说时再开口。这家店叫什么名字——三——三个什么？”","“So give us the bundle,” said Noah, unstrapping it from the woman’s shoulders, and slinging it over his own; “and don’t yer speak, except when yer spoke to.What’s the name of the house—t-h-r—three what?”"
"“瘸子。”夏洛特说。","“Cripples,” said Charlotte."
"“三个瘸子，”诺亚重复道，“真是个不错的招牌。喂喂！紧跟着点儿，过来。”他边下达着命令，边用肩膀顶开咯吱作响的大门，走进旅馆，他的同伴跟在后面。","“Three Cripples,” repeated Noah, “and a very good sign too.Now, then!Keep close at my heels, and come along.”With these injunctions, he pushed the rattling door with his shoulder, and entered the house, followed by his companion."
"吧台里除了有一个年轻的犹太佬外就再没别人了，那年轻人双肘支在柜台上，正在读一张脏脏的报纸。他恶狠狠地盯着诺亚，诺亚也凶巴巴地盯着他。","There was nobody in the bar but a young Jew, who, with his two elbows on the counter, was reading a dirty newspaper.He stared very hard at Noah, and Noah stared very hard at him."
"如果诺亚这时穿的仍是那一身孤儿院的衣服，那么还能解释这犹太佬为何把眼睛瞪得这么大；但是诺亚已经把外套和徽章给扔了，现在，他穿着皮短裤，上边是短款的长罩衫，这样的外表，似乎没有什么特别的理由能够在一间旅馆里引起别人这么大的关注。","If Noah had been attired in his charity-boy’s dress, there might have been some reason for the Jew opening his eyes so wide; but as he had discarded the coat and badge, and wore a short smock-frock over his leathers, there seemed no particular reason for his appearance exciting so much attention in a public-house."
"“这里是‘三个瘸子’旅馆吗？”诺亚问道。","“Is this the Three Cripples?” asked Noah."
"“是叫这个名字。”犹太佬回答。","“That is the dabe of this ‘ouse’,” replied the Jew."
"“我们从乡下来，在路上遇到一位绅士，他向我们推荐了这里。”诺亚说，用胳膊肘轻轻地碰了碰夏洛特，可能是想让她注意到这种赢取别人尊重的最机智的办法，也可能是警告她不要大惊小怪。“我们今晚想睡在这里。”","“A gentleman we met on the road, coming up from the country, recommended us here,” said Noah, nudging Charlotte, perhaps to call her attention to this most ingenious device for attracting respect, and perhaps to warn her to betray no surprise.“We want to sleep here to-night.”"
"“这事我说了不算。”巴尼说，本书中要常常见到这个怪物，“我去给你问问。”","“I”b dot certaid you cad,” said Barney, who was the attendant sprite; “but I’ll idquire.”"
"“告诉我们酒吧在哪儿，再给我们来点儿冷肉、一些啤酒，然后你再去问，行吗？”诺亚说。","“Show us the tap, and give us a bit of cold meat and a drop of beer while yer inquiring, will yer?” said Noah."
"巴尼照做了，把他们领到后面的一个小房间里，在他们面前摆上了要的酒菜，然后告诉这两位旅客他们今晚可以留宿在这里，接着退了出去，留下这友好的一对自己用餐歇息。","Barney complied by ushering them into a small back-room, and setting the required viands before them; having done which, he informed the travellers that they could be lodged that night, and left the amiable couple to their refreshment."
"小房间就在吧台的背后，比吧台低几个台阶。旅馆的任何相关人员，只要掀开一层小小的帘子，透过被帘子遮住的一层玻璃，玻璃就在上述房间的墙上，离地大约五英尺高，不仅能俯身看到小房间里的任何客人，而且几乎不用担心被发现（玻璃在墙的暗处，观察者正处在这个暗处与一根笔直的大梁之间），并且，只要将耳朵贴在这隔断上，外面的人也基本上能够听清楚房间里的谈话内容。","Now, this back-room was immediately behind the bar, and some steps lower, so that any person connected with the house, undrawing a small curtain which concealed a single pane of glass fixed in the wall of the last-named apartment, about five feet from its flooring, could not only look down upon any guests in the back-room without any great hazard of being observed (the glass being in a dark angle of the wall, between which and a large upright beam the observer had to thrust himself), but could, by applying his ear to the partition, ascertain with tolerable distinctness, their subject of conversation."
"旅馆老板的目光从这个观察点移开还不足五分钟，巴尼也刚刚向客人说完那几句话回来，这时费金就走了进来，他正在进行晚上的活动，想要打听自己几个徒弟的情况。","The landlord of the house had not withdrawn his eye from this place of espial for five minutes, and Barney had only just returned from making the communication above related, when Fagin, in the course of his evening’s business, came into the bar to inquire after some of his young pupils."
"“嘘！”巴尼说，“隔壁屋里有陌生人。”","“Hush!” said Barney:“strangers id the next roob.”"
"“陌生人！”老头低声重复道。","“Strangers!” repeated the old man in a whisper."
"“啊！是两个古怪的家伙。”巴尼补充道，“从乡下来，我要是没看错，他们绝对是你们这一行的。”","“Ah! Ad rub uds too,” added Barney.“Frob the cuttry, but subthig in your way, or I’d bistaked.”"
"听了这话，费金看上去很感兴趣。","Fagin appeared to receive this communication with great interest."
"他爬上一张椅子，小心地把眼睛凑在玻璃上，从这个秘密哨岗上可以看见，克雷波尔先生正从盘子里拿冷牛肉吃，从大壶里倒黑啤酒喝，还随意地给耐心坐在一旁的夏洛特分了一点儿吃的喝的，分量少得就跟顺势疗法的剂量一样。","Mounting a stool, he cautiously applied his eye to the pane of glass, from which secret post he could see Mr. Claypole taking cold beef from the dish, and porter from the pot, and administering homeopathic doses of both to Charlotte, who sat patiently by, eating and drinking at his pleasure."
"“啊哈！”他回过头看着巴尼，低声说，“我喜欢那人的样子。他会对我们有用的，他已经知道如何训练那女人了。别跟老鼠似的弄出那么大的声响，亲爱的，让我听听他们说话——让我听听。”","“Aha!” he whispered, looking round to Barney, “I like that fellow’looks.He’d be of use to us; he knows how to train the girl already.Don’t make as much noise as a mouse, my dear, and let me hear ’em talk—let me hear ’em.”"
"他又将眼睛凑在玻璃上，把耳朵贴在隔断上专心地听着，脸上露出微妙而急切的表情，像极了某个老妖怪。","He again applied his eye to the glass, and turning his ear to the partition, listened attentively: with a subtle and eager look upon his face, that might have appertained to some old goblin."
"“所以我想要做个绅士。”克雷波尔先生踢了踢腿，接着说，费金来迟了一步，没有听到开头的部分。“再也不用去恭维那些老棺材了，夏洛特，我要过绅士的生活，并且，如果你愿意，你就做一位太太。”","“So I mean to be a gentleman,” said Mr. Claypole, kicking out his legs, and continuing a conversation, the commencement of which Fagin had arrived too late to hear.“No more jolly old coffins, Charlotte, but a gentleman’s life for me: and, if yer like, yer shall be a lady.”"
"“我当然非常愿意，亲爱的，”夏洛特回答道，“但是我们不能天天去扫荡装钱的抽屉，人们事后会查出来的。”","“I should like that well enough, dear,” replied Charlotte; “but tills ain’t to be emptied every day, and people to get clear off after it.”"
"“见鬼的抽屉！”克雷波尔先生说，“除了扫荡抽屉外，还有很多别的事情可做呢。”","“Tills be blowed!” said Mr. Claypole; “there’s more things besides tills to be emptied.”"
"“你是什么意思？”他的女伴问。","“What do you mean?” asked his companion."
"“口袋、女人的手袋、住宅、邮车，还有银行！”克雷波尔先生举起一杯黑啤酒说道。","“Pockets, women’s ridicules, houses, mail-coaches, banks!” said Mr. Claypole, rising with the porter."
"“但是这些事，你一个人也做不了啊，亲爱的。”夏洛特说。","“But you can’t do all that, dear,” said Charlotte."
"“我会找到能跟我合作的人。”诺亚回答，“他们总能让我们派上点儿用场。哎，你一个人抵得上五十个女人；只要我放你出去，绝对没有一个女人能像你这样矫揉造作、诡计多端。”","“I shall look out to get into company with them as can,” replied Noah.“They’ll be able to make us useful some way or another.Why, you yourself are worth fifty women; I never see such a precious sly and deceitful creetur as yer can be when I let yer.”"
"“天哪，听你这样说,我真是太高兴了！”夏洛特叫道，在他那张丑陋的脸上吻了一下。","“Lor, how nice it is to hear yer say so!” exclaimed Charlotte, imprinting a kiss upon his ugly face."
"“行了行了，你別太亲密了，免得我生气。”诺亚说着，费了好大劲才挣脱出来。“我想要做某个团伙的头，让他们都听我的话，还要悄悄地跟着他们，连他们自己都不知道。这很适合我，只要有利可图，只要我们能碰上这一行的绅士，就是花掉你得到的那二十镑支票也值得——特别是，现在我们也不清楚怎么才能把它花掉。”","“There, that’s ll do: don’t yer be too affectionate, in case I’m cross with yer,” said Noah, disengaging himself with great gravity.“I should like to be the captain of some band, and have the whopping of’em, and follering ’em about, unbeknown to themselves.That would suit me, if there was good profit; and if we could only get in with some gentleman of this sort, I say it would be cheap at that twenty-pound note you’ve got,—especially as we don’t very well know how to get rid of it ourselves.”"
"发表完这一高见之后，克雷波尔先生带着一副大智慧的神气盯着啤酒壶看了一阵；他摇了摇壶里的酒，施恩似的向夏洛特点点头，他又呷了口啤酒，似乎因此大大地提起精神来。他正想着要再喝一口，这时突然有人打开了房门，门口站着一个陌生人，打断了他。","After expressing this opinion, Mr. Claypole looked into the porter-pot with an aspect of deep wisdom; and having well shaken its contents, nodded condescendingly to Charlotte, and took a draught, wherewith he appeared greatly refreshed.He was meditating another, when the sudden opening of the door, and the appearance of a stranger, interrupted him."
"这个陌生人就是费金先生。他看上去十分亲切，走上前一步，深深地鞠了个躬，然后坐在最近的桌子旁；巴尼咧嘴笑着，费金向他点了一些喝的东西。","The stranger was Mr. Fagin.And very amiable he looked, and a very low bow he made, as he advanced, and setting himself down at the nearest table, ordered something to drink of the grinning Barney."
"“真是个愉快的晚上啊，先生，但是这个时节有些冷了。”费金搓着手说，“我猜，您是从乡下来的吧，先生？”","“A pleasant night, sir, but cool for the time of year,” said Fagin, rubbing his hands.“From the country, I see, sir?”"
"“你是怎么看出来的？”诺亚·克雷波尔问道。","“How do yer see that?” asked Noah Claypole."
"“我们伦敦这里可没有那么多尘土。”费金回答，手指着诺亚和其同伴的鞋，又指了指那两个包袱。","“We have not so much dust as that in London,” replied Fagin, pointing from Noah’s shoes to those of his companion, and from them to the two bundles."
"“真是个厉害的家伙。”诺亚说，“哈！哈！听听这个，夏洛特！”","“Yer a sharp feller,” said Noah.“Ha! ha! only hear that, Charlotte!”"
"“哎，在这城里没点儿眼力可不成啊，亲爱的。”这个犹太佬低声说道，好像在悄声说一个秘密，“这是真话。”","“Why, one need be sharp in this town, my dear,” replied the Jew, sinking his voice to a confidential whisper; “and that’s the truth.”"
"费金说罢，用右手食指敲了敲鼻翼，诺亚也试图模仿这个动作，却因为自己的鼻子还不够大而没有成功。然而，费金先生似乎将诺亚这个尝试看成是对他观点极度赞同的表示，然后以一种非常友好的态度，将巴尼端上来的酒敬给诺亚。","Fagin followed up this remark by striking the side of his nose with his right forefinger,—a gesture which Noah attempted to imitate, though not with complete success, in consequence of his own nose not being large enough for the purpose.However, Mr. Fagin seemed to interpret the endeavour as expressing a perfect coincidence with his opinion, and put about the liquor which Barney reappeared with, in a very friendly manner."
"“真是好东西。”克雷波尔先生咂着嘴说道。","“Good stuff that,” observed Mr. Claypole, smacking his lips."
"“亲爱的！”费金说,","“Dear!” said Fagin."
"“如果一个人想常常喝到这种酒，他就要经常对抽屉、口袋、女士提包、住宅，或者邮车以及银行扫荡一番。”","“A man need be always emptying a till, or a pocket, or a woman’s reticule, or a house, or a mail-coach, or a bank, if he drinks it regularly.”"
"克雷波尔先生一听到这段从他自己刚才那番话中摘出来的片段，不由得瘫倒在椅子里，望望犹太佬，又望望夏洛特，面色苍白，表情极度惊恐。","Mr. Claypole no sooner heard this extract from his own remarks than he fell back in his chair, and looked from the Jew to Charlotte with a countenance of ashy paleness and excessive terror."
"“别介意，亲爱的。”费金说着，把他的椅子拉近一些。“哈！哈！还好只是让我碰巧听见了你的话，你真够走运的。你很幸运，仅仅是被我听到了。”","“Don’t mind me, my dear,” said Fagin, drawing his chair closer.“Ha! ha ! it was lucky it was only me that heard you by chance.It was very lucky it was only me.”"
"“不是我拿的。”诺亚结结巴巴地说，不再像个自信的绅士一样把腿伸得长长的，而是尽可能地把它们缩回到椅子下，“都是她干的。现在你就拿着的，夏洛特，你知道是你自己干的。”","“I didn’t take it,” stammered Noah, no longer stretching out his legs like an independent gentleman, but coiling them up as well as he could under his chair; “it was all her doing; yer’ve got it now, Charlotte, yer know yer have.”"
"“别管是谁拿着，或者是谁干的，亲爱的。”费金回答道，但是他用鹰一般的眼睛扫了一眼女人和那两个包裹。“我也是干这一行的。因此我才喜欢你们。”","“No matter who’s got it, or who did it, my dear,” replied Fagin, glancing, nevertheless, with a hawk’s eye at the girl and the two bundles.“I’m in that way myself, and I like you for it.”"
"“哪一行？”克雷波尔先生稍稍回过神来，问道。","“In what way?” asked Mr. Claypole, a little recovering."
"“正经生意。”费金继续说，“这个店里的人也都一样。你算是找对地方了，这里再安全不过了。你在全城都找不到比瘸子旅店更安全的地方；我是说，如果我想让它这样的话。我挺喜欢你和你的年轻女伴，所以我才这么说，你尽可以放心。”","“In that way of business,” rejoined Fagin; “and so are the people of the house.You’ve  hit the right nail upon the head, and are as safe here as you could be.There is not a safer place in all this town than is the Cripples; that is, when I like to make it so.And I have taken a fancy to you and the young woman; so I’ve  said the word, and you may make your minds easy.”"
"听了这番保证，诺亚·克雷波尔总算是放了心，但他的身子还没有放松；他不断扭动着，变换着各种粗野笨拙的姿势，用一种交织着恐惧与怀疑的目光打量着这个新朋友。","Noah Claypole’s mind might have been at ease after this assurance, but his body certainly was not; for he shuffled and writhed about, into various uncouth positions: eyeing his new friend meanwhile with mingled fear and suspicion."
"“我还要告诉你更多。”费金向夏洛特嘀咕了几句鼓励的话，又朝她友好地点了点头，让她放心，然后说道，“我认识一个朋友，也许能满足你迫切的愿望，引你走上正路。一开始，你可以选择这一行里你认为最适合的工作来做，然后还能学会其他的。”","“I’ll tell you more,” said Fagin, after he had reassured the girl, by dint of friendly nods and muttered encouragements.“I have got a friend that I think can gratify your darling wish, and put you in the right way, where you can take whatever department of the business you think will suit you best at first, and be taught all the others.”"
"“你说这话好像很认真。”诺亚回答。","“Yer speak as if yer were in earnest,” replied Noah."
"“不认真对我有什么好处呢？”费金耸耸肩，问道，“来！我跟你到外面去说句话。”","“What advantage would it be to me to be anything else?” inquired Fagin, shrugging his shoulders.“Here!Let me have a word with you outside.”"
"“用不着起来吧，挺麻烦的。”诺亚说，又慢慢地把他的腿伸了出来。“我们说话时她会拿行李上楼去。夏洛特，看好那些行李。”","“There’s no occasion to trouble ourselves to move,” said Noah, getting his legs by gradual degrees abroad again.“She’ll take the luggage upstairs the while.Charlotte, see to them bundles.”"
"这道命令带着说一不二的权威，执行者也丝毫没有异议；诺亚拉开房门，看着她出去，夏洛特赶紧拿上行李走了出去。","This mandate, which had been delivered with great majesty, was obeyed without the slightest demur; and Charlotte made the best of her way off with the packages while Noah held the door open and watched her out."
"“她表现得很听话，不是吗？”他又坐回去，以一种饲养员驯服了野兽的口吻问道。","“She’s kept tolerably well under, ain’t she?” he asked as he resumed his seat: in the tone of a keeper who had tamed some wild animal."
"“真不赖。”费金拍了拍诺亚的肩膀，说道，“你真是个天才，亲爱的。”","“Quite perfect,” rejoined Fagin, clapping him on the shoulder.“You’re a genius, my dear.”"
"“哎，我想，如果我不是的话，我也就不会在这儿了。”诺亚回答道，“但是，我说，你要是再浪费时间的话，她就该回来了。”","“Why, I suppose if I wasn’t, I shouldn’t be here,” replied Noah.“But, I say, she’ll be back if yer lose time.”"
"“那么，你是怎么想的？”费金说，“如果你喜欢我的朋友，有什么比加入到他那里更好呢？”","“Now, what do you think?” said Fagin.“If you was to like my friend, could you do better than join him?”"
"“他的生意到底好不好，这就是问题所在！”诺亚眨巴着一只小眼睛，答道。","“Is he in a good way of business; that’s where it is!” responded Noah, winking one of his little eyes."
"“顶级好,他雇了大批人手，他们是圈子里最厉害的一群人。”","“The top of the tree; employs a power of hands; has the very best society in the profession.”"
"“全是城里人？”克雷波尔先生问道。","“Regular town-maders?” asked Mr. Claypole."
"“没一个乡下人；而且，如果不是他现在正好缺帮手，即使有我的推荐他也不一定会接纳你。”费金回答。","“Not a countryman among ’em; and I don’t think he’d take you, even on my recommendation, if he didn’t run rather short of assistants just now,” replied Fagin."
"“我要不要先送点儿礼？”诺亚拍了拍短裤上的口袋，说道。","“Should I have to hand over?” said Noah, slapping his breeches-pocket."
"“不送恐怕不行。”费金用一种斩钉截铁的语气回答。","“It couldn’t possibly be done without,” replied Fagin, in a most decided manner."
"“二十镑，可是——这是很大的一笔钱！”","“Twenty pound, though—it’s a lot of money!”"
"“如果你有一张无法出手的支票，那就不一样了。”费金反驳道，“我想，数字和日期都记下来了吧？不能在银行付款？啊！这对他倒没什么用。只能弄到外国去，在市场上也卖不出什么好价钱。”","“Not when it’s in a note you can’t get rid of,” retorted Fagin.“Number and date taken, I suppose?Payment stopped at the Bank?Ah! it’s not worth much to him. it’s s ll have to go abroad, and he couldn’t sell it for a great deal in the market.”"
"“我什么时候能见到他？”诺亚怀疑地问。","“When could I see him?” asked Noah doubtfully."
"“明天早上。”","“To-morrow morning.”"
"“在哪儿？”","“Where?”"
"“就在这里。”","“Here.”"
"“嗯！”诺亚说，“酬劳有多少？”","“Um!” sadi Noah.“What’s the wages?”"
"“像一个绅士一样生活——吃的、住的，还有香烟、烈酒全都免费——还有你赚的一半加上你那位年轻女伴赚的一半。”费金回答。","“Live like a gentleman—board and lodging, pipes and spirits free—half of all you earn, and half of all the young woman earns,” replied Mr. Fagin."
"如果诺亚·克雷波尔是自由身，以他那不知满足的贪婪之心，很让人怀疑他是否会接受这些光彩熠熠的条件；但是，他想到如果自己拒绝的话，他这位新朋友很有可能会立即将自己送到法庭（比这更不可能的事都发生过），于是他的态度渐渐缓和了些，说他认为这工作很适合他。","Whether Noah Claypole, whose rapacity was none of the least comprehensive, would have acceded even to these glowing terms, had he been a perfectly free agent, is very doubtful; but as he recollected that, in the event of his refusal, it was in the power of his new acquaintance to give him up to justice immediately (and more unlikely things had come to pass), he gradually relented, and said he thought that would suit him."
"“不过，你看，”诺亚说，“既然那女人可以做很多事，我希望能干点儿轻松的活。”","“But, yer see,” observed Noah, “as she will be able to do a good deal, I should like to take something very light.”"
"“一件不累又好玩的活？”费金建议道。","“A little fancy work?” suggested Fagin."
"“啊！就是那样的活。”诺亚回答，“你觉得现在有什么适合我？你知道，一些不用耗费太多体力，又不太危险的事情。就是那一类的事！”","“Ah! something of that sort,” replied Noah.“What do you think would suit me now?Something not too trying for the strength, and not very dangerous, you know.That’s the sort of thing!”"
"“我听你说起过关于盯梢的事，亲爱的。”费金说，“我的朋友正需要能做这事的人，非常需要。”","“I heard you talk of something in the spy way upon the others, my dear,” said Fagin.“My friend wants somebody who would do that well, very much.”"
"“哎，我确实说过这话，而且我也不介意有时候做做这样的事。”克雷波尔先生缓缓地说，“但是，你知道，这活本身赚不来钱啊。”","“Why, I did mention that, and I shouldn’t mind turning my hand to it sometimes,” rejoined Mr. Claypole slowly; “but it wouldn’t pay by itself, you know.”"
"“那倒是！”犹太佬说道，沉思着，或者说装出一副沉思的样子。“不，也许不是的。”","“That’s true!” observed the Jew, ruminating or pretending to ruminate.“No, it might not.”"
"“那么，你觉得呢？”诺亚热切地看着他，问道,“有没有一些偷偷摸摸的事，可靠性很大的工作，不会比在家危险到哪里去？”","“What do you think, then?” asked Noah, anxiously regarding him.“Something in the sneaking way, where it was pretty sure work, and not much more risk than being at home.”"
"“你认为老妇人怎么样？”费金问道。","“What do you think of the old ladies?” asked Fagin."
"“抢了她们的提包和手袋，然后转个弯就跑不见了，可是能赚很多钱啊。”","“There’s a good deal of money made in snatching their bags and parcels, and running round the corner.”"
"“但有时候她们不是会大喊大叫、到处乱抓吗？”诺亚摇着头问道，“我觉得这不合我的意。没有其他门路了吗？”","“Don’t they holler out a good deal, and scratch sometimes?” asked Noah, shaking his head.“I don’t think that would answer my purpose.Ain’t there any other line open?”"
"“嘿！”费金说，一只手放在诺亚的膝盖上。","“Stop!” said Fagin, laying his hand on Noah’s knee."
"“收娃娃税。”","“The kinchin lay.”"
"“那是什么？”克雷波尔先生追问。","“What’s that?” demanded Mr. Claypole."
"“亲爱的，娃娃，”费金说，“就是给妈妈打发去办差事的小孩子，手里总有个几便士或先令的；税就是指抢走他们手里的钱——他们总是把钱攥在手里——再把他们推到路沟里，然后慢悠悠地走开，装作好像什么事都没发生过一样，只不过是有个小孩子跌倒弄伤了自己。哈！哈！哈！”","“The kinchins, my dear,” said Fagin, “is the young children that’s sent on errands by their mothers, with sixpences and shillings; and the lay is just to take their money away—they’ve  always got it ready in their hands,—then knock “em into the kennel, and walk off very slow, as if there were nothing else the matter but a child fallen down and hurt itself.Ha! ha! ha!”"
"“哈！哈！”克雷波尔先生放声大笑，欣喜若狂地叫道，“天哪，就是这种事！”","“Ha! ha!” roared Mr. Claypole, kicking up his legs in an ecstasy.“Lord, that’s the very thing!”"
"“就是这样的事，”费金答道，“我们可以在卡姆登镇、战桥，以及附近类似的地方划出几块好地盘给你，那些地方出来办差事的小孩很多；你想把多少小孩推到沟里都成，白天任何时候都可以。哈！哈！哈！”","“To be sure it is,” replied Fagin; “and you can have a few good beats chalked out in Camden Town, and Battle Bridge, and neighborhoods like that, where they’re always going errands; and you can upset as many kinchins as you want, any hour in the day.Ha! ha! ha!"
"说到这里，费金戳了一下克雷波尔先生的肋部，接着他们一同爆发出一阵持久而又响亮的大笑。","With this, Fagin poked Mr. Claypole in the side, and they joined in a burst of laughter both long and loud."
"“好啊，那样真不错！”诺亚恢复了常态，说道；这时夏洛特也回来了。“说好明天什么时候？”","“Well, that’s all right!” said Noah, when he had recovered himself, and Charlotte had returned.“What time to-morrow shall we say?”"
"“十点钟怎么样？”费金问。克雷波尔先生赞同地点了点头，费金又补充道，“向我的好朋友介绍你时，我该怎么称呼你呢？”","“Will ten do?” asked Fagin, adding, as Mr. Claypole nodded assent, “What name shall I tell my good friend.”"
"“博尔特先生。”诺亚回答，他早已对这种紧急情况有所准备。“莫里斯·博尔特先生。这位是博尔特太太。”","“Mr. Bolter,” replied Noah, who had prepared himself for such emergency.“Mr. Morris Bolter.This is Mrs. Bolter.”"
"“愿为博尔特太太效劳。”费金鞠了个躬，带着极不协调的礼节说道，“希望短时间之内便能更好地了解太太。”","“Mrs. Bolter’s humble servant,” said Fagin, bowing with grotesque politeness.“I hope I shall know her better very shortly.”"
"“你听到这位绅士的话了吗，夏洛特？”克雷波尔先生吼道。","“Do you hear the gentleman, Charlotte?” thundered Mr. Claypole."
"“听到了，诺亚，亲爱的！”博尔特太太一边回答，一边伸出手来。","“Yes, Noah, dear!” replied Mrs. Bolter, extending her hand."
"“她叫我诺亚，这是说话时的昵称。”莫里斯·博尔特先生，即前克雷波尔先生，转向费金说道，“你明白吗？”","“She calls me Noah, as a sort of fond way of talking,” said Mr. Morris Bolter, late Claypole, turning to Fagin.“You understand?”"
"“哦，当然，我明白——完全明白。”费金答道，他就这一次说了实话。“晚安！晚安！”","“Oh yes, I understand—perfectly,” replied Fagin, telling the truth for once.“Good-night!Good-night!”"
"说了许多次再见和祝好之后，费金先生便走开了。诺亚·克雷波尔提醒他那位精明的太太要打起精神，又向她讲明了自己计划中的相关安排。他带着高傲而又优越的气场，不仅使之成为堂堂男子汉中合格的一员，更是一位绅士，并能够体会到在伦敦及其近郊执行收娃娃税这一特殊任命的尊贵之处。","With many adieus and good wishes, Mr. Fagin went his way.Noah Claypole, bespeaking his good lady’s attention, proceeded to enlighten her relative to the arrangement he had made, with all that haughtiness and air of superiority, becoming, not only a member of the sterner sex, but a gentleman who appreciated the dignity of a special appointment on the kinchin lay, in London and its vicinity."
"第四十三章 以下讲述狡猾的机灵鬼是怎样遇到麻烦的","CHAPTER XLIII Wherein is shown how the artful Dodger got into trouble "
"“那么你的朋友原来就是你自己啊，是不是？”克雷波尔先生，即博尔特先生问道。根据他们之间达成的协议，他次日便搬进了费金的家里。“天哪，我昨晚也想到了！”","“And so it was you that was your own friend, was it?” asked Mr. Claypole, otherwise Bolter, when, by virtue of the compact entered into between them, he had removed next day to Fagin’s house.“Cod, I thought as much last night!”"
"“每个人都是他自己的朋友，亲爱的。”费金露出最谄媚的笑，回答道，“任何地方都再找不出像他自己这么好的朋友。”","“Every man’s his own friend, my dear,” replied Fagin, with his most insinuating grin.“He hasn’t as good a one as himself anywhere.”"
"“有时候也不一定，”莫里斯·博尔特说，摆出一副见过世面的样子。“你知道，有些人没有别的敌人，专跟自己过不去。”","“Except sometimes,” replied Morris Bolter, assuming the air of a man of the world.“Some people are nobody’s enemies but their own, yer know.”"
"“别相信那个。”费金说，“如果一个人跟自己过不去，那只是因为他跟自己是太过要好的朋友了，并不是因为他对任何人都很关心，唯独不在意自己。呸！呸！世上可没有这种事。”","“Don’t believe that,” said Fagin.“When a man’s his own enemy, it’s  only because he’s too much his own friend; not because he’s careful for everybody but himself.Pooh! pooh!There ain’t such a thing in nature.”"
"“如果有，也实在是不应该。”博尔特先生回答道。","“There oughn’t to be, if there is,” replied Mr. Bolter."
"“这才说得过去。有些变戏法的说，三是神奇的数字，而有些却说七才是。哪个都不是，我的朋友，哪个都不是。数字一才是。”","“That stands to reason.Some conjurers say that number three is the magic number, and some say number seven.It’s neither, my friend, neither.It’s number one.”"
"“哈！哈！”博尔特先生叫道，“一永远是第一。”","“Ha! ha!” cried Mr. Bolter.“Number one for ever.”"
"“在一个像我们这样的小团体中，亲爱的，”费金说，他觉得有必要解释清楚这一观点，“我们有个总的一号，要想想我，其他的年轻人一样都是。”","“In a little community like ours, my dear,” said Fagin, who felt it necessary to qualify this position, “we have a general number one, without considering me too as the same, and all the other young people.”"
"“哦，真见鬼！”博尔特先生喊道。","“Oh, the devil!” exclaimed Mr. Bolter."
"“你知道，”费金接着说，装作没听见刚才那一声，“我们都混在一起，有共同的利益，非这样不可。比如说，你的目标是关心照顾一号——就是你自己。”","“You see,” pursued Fagin, affecting to disregard this interruption, “we are so mixed up together, and identified in our interests, that it must be so.For instance, it’s  your object to take care of number one—meaning yourself.”"
"“当然。”博尔特先生回答，“你说得对。”","“Certainly,” replied Mr. Bolter.“Yer about right there.”"
"“对啊！所以你就不能只负责你自己这个一号，而不关心我这个一号。”","“Well!You can’t take care of yourself, number one, without taking care of me, number one.”"
"“你是说二号吧。”博尔特先生说，他在自私自利这方面实在很有天赋。","“Number two, you mean,” said Mr. Bolter, who was largely endowed with the quality of selfishness."
"“不，我没说二号！”费金反驳道，“我对你一样重要，就像你对你自己很重要一样。”","“No, I don’t!” retorted Fagin.“I’m of the same importance to you, as you are to yourself.”"
"“我说，”博尔特先生打断了他，“你是个很好的人，我很喜欢你，但是到目前为止，我们还没到那么亲密的程度吧。”","“I say,” interrupted Mr. Bolter, “yer a very nice man, and I’m very fond of yer; but we ain’t quite so thick together, as all that comes to.”"
"“只是让你想一想，”费金耸耸肩膀说，伸出手来。“只是想一想。你做了一件很不错的事，我也喜欢你这么做；但是同时，这事也让你的脖子上套上了条领巾，套上去很容易，但是拿下来就难——说明白点儿，就是绞索！”","“Only think,” said Fagin, shrugging his shoulders, and stretching out his hands; “Only consider. You’ve done what’s a very pretty thing, and what I love you for doing; but what at the same time would put the cravat round your throat, that’s so very easily tied and so very difficult to unloose—in plain English, the halter!”"
"博尔特先生用手摸了摸领巾，好像觉得它有些紧，不太舒服；他嘟囔着表示同意，不过是用语调，而不是话语。","Mr. Bolter put his hand to his neckerchief, as if he felt it inconveniently tight; and murmured an assent, qualified in tone but not in substance."
"“绞刑架，”费金接着说，“绞刑架，亲爱的，是一块丑陋的路标，指向一条急转直下的短道，断送了多少条好汉的远大前程。始终挑容易的路走，而且始终要离绞刑架远远的，这就是你的一号目标。”","“The gallows,” continued Fagin, “the gallows, my dear, is an ugly finger-post, which points out a very short and sharp turning that has stopped many a bold fellow’s career on the broad highway.To keep in the easy road, and keep it at a distance, is object number one with you.”"
"“当然，确定无疑。”博尔特先生回答说，“你说这些是为了什么？”","“Of course it is,” replied Mr. Bolter.“What do yer talk about such things for?”"
"“只是想把我的意思明明白白地告诉给你听。”这犹太佬抬了抬眉毛，说道，“要想做成那事，你得靠我。为了让我那点儿小生意平平稳稳的，我得靠你。前者是你的一号，后者则是我的一号。你越重视你的一号，你就必须越留心我的一号，因此我们就回到了我刚才对你说的一番话上——以一号为重，我们才能团结在一起，而且必须这么做，否则只有散伙。”","“Only to show you my meaning clearly,” said the Jew, raising his eyebrows.“To be able to do that, you depend upon me.To keep my little business all snug, I depend upon you.The first is your number one, the second my number one.The more you value your number one, the more careful you must be of mine; so we come at last to what I told you at first—that a regard for number one holds us all together, and must do so, unless we would all go to pieces in company.”"
"“这倒是。”博尔特先生若有所思地说道，“哦！你可真是老奸巨猾！”","“That’s true,” rejoined Mr. Bolter, thoughtfully.“Oh! yer a cunning old codger!”"
"费金看出对他能力的这一称赞并不只是恭维话，感到很高兴；他已经给他的新手下留下了一个诡计多端的印象，在两人交往之初就留下这种印象是最为重要的。为了加深这个有用而又令人满意的印象，他又继续跟进，把业务的范围和意义更加详尽地向博尔特介绍了一遍；为了更好地突出自已的意图，他还将真实的事与捏造的事混杂在一起；并且，他两者都运用得颇有水平，使得博尔特先生的尊敬之情明显地有所增加，脾气也变得温和了；有时，他还带着一丝对费金有利的畏惧之心，而唤起这种畏惧是相当令人满意的。","Mr. Fagin saw, with delight, that this tribute to his powers was no mere compliment, but that he had really impressed his recruit with a sense of his wily genius, which it was most important that he should entertain in the outset of their acquaintance.To strengthen an impression so desirable and useful, he followed up the blow by acquainting him, in some detail, with the magnitude and extent of his operations; blending truth and fiction together, as best served his purpose;and bringing both to bear, with so much art, that Mr. Bolter’s respect visibly increased, and became tempered, at the same time, with a degree of wholesome fear, which it was highly desirable to awaken."
"“正是我们对彼此的这种相互信任，使我在惨痛的损失面前得以安慰。”费金说，“昨天早上，我最好的手下离开了我。”","“It’s this mutual trust we have in each other that consoles me under heavy losses,” said Fagin.“My best hand was taken from me, yesterday morning.”"
"“你的意思不会是他死了吧？”博尔特惊叫道。","“You don’t mean to say he died?” cried Mr. Bolter."
"“不，不，”费金回答，“还不至于那样糟。不至于那样糟。”","“No, no,” replied Fagin, “not so bad as that.Not quite so bad.”"
"“那么，我想他是——”“嫌疑犯。”费金插嘴说，“对，他成了嫌疑犯了。”","“What, I suppose he was—” “Wanted,” interposed Fagin.“Yes, he was wanted.”"
"“很严重吗？”博尔特先生询问道，","“Very particular?” inquired Mr. Bolter."
"“不，”费金回答，“不是很严重。他被指控扒窃，他们在他身上找到了个银的鼻烟盒——那是他自己的，亲爱的，他自己的，因为他自己吸鼻烟，很喜欢吸。他们一直把他拘留到今天，因为他们认为已经确认了失主的身份。啊！他值五十个鼻烟盒的价钱，而且我也愿意出这个价钱把他弄回来。你应该见见这个机灵鬼，亲爱的，你应该认识认识这个人。”","“No,” replied Fagin, “not very.He was charged with attempting to pick a pocket, and they found a silver snuff-box on him,—his own, my dear, his own, for he took snuff himself, and was very fond of it.They remanded him till to-day, for they thought they knew the owner.Ah! he was worth fifty boxes, and I’d give the price of as many to have him back.You should have known the Dodger, my dear; you should have known the Dodger.”"
"“嗯，我想我以后会认识他的，希望如此，你不这样认为吗？”博尔特先生说。","“Well, but I shall know him, I hope; don’t yer think so?” sadi Bolter."
"“我很怀疑。”费金叹了口气说，“如果他们拿不到什么新的证据，这只是个即席判决案，差不多六周之后我们就能再见到他；但是，如果他们拿出了证据，这就成了累积案了。他们知道他有多机灵，但他会得到一张永久票。他们什么都不会给这个机灵鬼，除了给他弄一张永久票。”","“I’m doubtful about it,” replied Fagin, with a sigh.“If they don’t get any fresh evidence, it’s s ll only be a summary conviction, and we shall have him back again after six weeks or so; but, if they do, it’s  a case of lagging.They know what a clever lad he is; he’ll be a lifer.They’ll make the Artful nothing less than a lifer.”"
"“你说的累积案和永久票是什么意思？”博尔特追问道，","“What do you mean by lagging and a lifer?” demanded Mr. Bolter."
"“用那些个字眼跟我说话有什么好处，为什么不用我能听懂的话来说呢？”","“What’s the good of talking in that way to me; why don’t yer speak so as I can understand yer?”"
"费金正要把这些难懂的表达用平实的语言翻译出来，这样博尔特先生听了解释，就会明白这些词语表示“终生流放”的意思。就在此时，贝茨少爷突然进来了，打断了对话，他两手插在裤兜里，脸上表情扭曲，呈现一种令人觉得好笑的悲伤之情。","Fagin was about to translate these mysterious expressions into the vulgar tongue; and, being interpreted, Mr. Bolter would have been informed that they represented that combination of words, “transportation for life,” when the dialogue was cut short by the entry of Master Bates, with his hands in his breeches-pockets, and his face twisted into a look of semi-comical woe."
"“全完了，费金。”查理和他的新同伙相互认识之后说道。","“It’s all up, Fagin,” said Charley, when he and his new companion had been made known to each other."
"“什么意思？”","“What do you mean?”"
"“他们找到了那个烟盒的主人，还有两三个人要来指认他，机灵鬼必须要走这一趟了。”贝茨少爷回答，“我得穿上一套丧服，费金，并且扎上帽带，在他上路前去看看他。想想吧，杰克·道金斯——了不起的杰克——机灵鬼——厉害的机灵鬼为了一个普普通通的、只值两个半便士的喷嚏盒子而要给流放！我想，要是流放，最起码也得是为了一个带链子和印章的金表。哦，他怎么不去把一些有钱的老绅士抢个精光，然后像个绅士似的流放，而不是作为一个普通的小偷，这样既不光彩也不体面！”","“They’ve  found the gentleman as owns the box; two or three more’s a coming to dentify him; and the Artful’s booked for a passage out,” replied Master Bates.“I must have a full suit of mourning, Fagin, and a hatband, to wisit him in, afore he sets out upon his travels.To think of Jack Dawkins—lummy Jack—the Dodger—the Artful Dodger—going abroad for a common twopenny-halfpenny sneeze-box!I never thought he’d a done it under a gold watch, chain, and seals, at the lowest.Oh, why didn’t he rob some rich old gentleman of all his walables, and go out as a gentleman, and not like a common prig, without no honour nor glory!”"
"发表了这一通对其友人不幸遭遇的演讲之后，贝茨少爷坐在离他最近的一张椅子上，流露出沮丧、懊恼的神态。","With this expression of feeling for his unfortunate friend, Master Bates sat himself on the nearest chair with an aspect of chagrin and despondency."
"“你说些什么‘他既不光彩又不体面’的话！”费金怒气冲冲地看着他的徒弟，大声说道，","“What do you talk about his having neither honour nor glory for!” exclaimed Fagin, darting an angry look at his pupil."
"“他不是一直是你们中间的头儿吗！你们中有谁在任何一点上能赶得上他，哪怕是跟他水平相当！嗯？”","“Wasn’t he always the top-sawyer among you all!Is there one of you that could touch him or come near him on any scent!Eh?”"
"“谁都不行，”贝茨少爷回答，他的声音因为后悔而变得有些沙哑，“一个也没有。”","“Not one,” replied Master Bates, in a voice rendered husky by regret; “not one.”"
"“那你还在说些什么？”费金生气地说，“那你还哭哭啼啼的做什么？”","“Then what do you talk of?” replied Fagin angrily; “what are you blubbering for?”"
"“因为这事不会给记录下来，不是吗？”查理说道，他现在十分懊恼，竟不耐烦地顶撞起自己的恩师。“因为这事不会出现在‘判决书’上；因为没有人会对他是个什么样的人有个一知半解。他怎么会出现在新门监狱的囚犯名册上？也许根本都不会在那上面出现。哦，天哪，天哪，多大的一个打击啊！”","“Cause it isn’t on the rec-ord, is it?” said Charley, chafed into perfect defiance of his venerable friend by the current of his regrets;“cause it can’t come out in the ‘dictment‘; cause nobody will never know half of what he was.How will he stand in the Newgate Calendar?P’raps not be there at all.Oh, my eye, my eye, wot a blow it is!”"
"“哈！哈！”费金叫喊起来，摊开他的右手，转向博尔特先生，爆发出一阵大笑，好像得了麻痹症似的颤抖起来，“看看他们对自己的职业有多骄傲，亲爱的。是不是很好？”","“Ha! ha!” cried Fagin, extending his right hand, and turning to Mr. Bolter in a fit of chuckling which shook him as though he had the palsy; “see what a pride they take in their profession, my dear.Ain’t it beautiful?”"
"博尔特先生点点头表示同意，费金带着显而易见的、满意的神情打量了悲痛的查理·贝茨几秒钟，接着走上前去拍了拍年轻人的肩膀。","Mr. Bolter nodded assent, and Fagin, after contemplating the grief of Charley Bates for some seconds with evident satisfaction, stepped up to that young gentleman and patted him on the shoulder."
"“别担心，查理，”费金安慰他说，“会写出来的，一定会写出来的。他们都会知道他曾是个多么机智的家伙；他会自己来证明这一点，不会给他的老伙计、老师傅丢脸的。想想看，他还这么年轻！查理，在他这么个年纪就给请去，这是何等荣耀啊！”","“Never mind, Charley,” said Fagin soothingly; “it’ll come out, it’ll be sure to come out.They’ll all know what a clever fellow he was; he’ll show it himself, and not disgrace his old pals and teachers.Think how young he is too!What a distinction, Charley, to be lagged at his time of life!”"
"“确实，这倒是很光彩！”查理说，稍稍觉得安慰了些。","“Well, it is a honour that is!” said Charley, a little consoled."
"“他想要什么就会有什么。”犹太佬继续说，“他在那石头牢房里，查理，会过得像一位绅士一样。像一位绅士！每天都有啤酒喝，兜里也装着钱，如果花不出去的话，还可以抛着玩。”","“He shall have all he wants,” continued the Jew.“He shall be kept in the Stone Jug, Charley, like a gentleman.Like a gentleman!With his beer every day, and money in his pocket to pitch and toss with, if he can’t spend it.”"
"“不，要是他能花出去呢？”查理·贝茨大叫道，","“No, shall he though?” cried Charley Bates."
"“啊，那他就会花出去，”费金答道，“而我们要找一位大人物，查理，一个说话最有天赋的人来给他辩护；他也可以为自己辩护，要是他愿意的话；然后我们会在报纸上读到这一切——‘厉害的机灵鬼数次高声大笑，整个法庭里的人都笑得前仰后合’——嗯，查理，嗯？”","“Ay, that he shall,” replied Fagin, “and we’ll have a big-wig, Charley: one that’s got the greatest gift of the gab: to carry on his defence; and he shall make a speech for himself too, if he likes; and we’ll read it all in the papers—Artful Dodger—shrieks of laughter—here the court was convulsed”—eh, Charley, eh?”"
"“哈！哈！”贝茨少爷笑着说，“那将会多有趣啊，不是吗，费金？我说，机灵鬼要给他们添多少麻烦啊，不是吗？”","“Ha! ha!” laughed Master Bates, “what a lark that would be, would’t it, Fagin?I say, how the Artful would bother “em wouldn’t he?”"
"“是的！”费金喊道，","“Would!” cried Fagin."
"“他会的——他会的！”","“He shall—he will!”"
"“啊，没错，他肯定会这么干的。”查理重复道，搓了搓手。","“Ah, to be sure, so he will,” repeated Charley, rubbing his hands."
"“我想我现在就看见他了。”犹太佬叫道，眼睛望着他的徒弟。","“I think I see him now,” cried the Jew, bending his eyes upon his pupil."
"“我也是。”查理·贝茨也叫道，“哈！哈！哈！我也是。好像这一切全在我眼前，我敢发誓，费金。多好玩啊！真是有意思！所有的大人物都试图装出庄重的样子，而杰克·道金斯亲切而又愉快地跟他们说话，就好像是法官自己的儿子在发表餐后演说一样——哈！","“So do I,” cried Charley Bates.“Ha! ha! ha! so do I.I see it all afore me, upon my soul I do, Fagin.What a game!What a regular game!All the big-wigs trying to look solemn, and Jack Dawkins addressing of ’em as intimate and comfortable as if he was the judge’s own son making a speech arter dinner—ha! ha! ha!”"
"事实上，费金先生巧妙地迁就着他这位年轻朋友古怪的个性，一开始贝茨先生还把关在监狱里的机灵鬼想成是个牺牲品，现在却把他看做是一场最不寻常、最精彩的滑稽剧里的领衔主演，而且他迫不及待地等着那个时刻的到来，让他那老伙计能有个大好机会好好地展示一下自己的本领。","In fact, Mr. Fagin had so well humoured his young friend’s eccentric disposition, that Master Bates, who had at first been disposed to consider the imprisoned Dodger rather in the light of a victim,now looked upon him as the chief actor in a scene of most uncommon and exquisite humour, and felt quite impatient for the arrival of the time when his old companion should have so favourable an opportunity of displaying his abilities."
"“我们得知道他今天过得怎么样，得找个什么省事的办法还是怎么样。”费金说，“让我想一想。”","“We must know how he gets on to-day, by some handy means or other,” said Fagin.“Let me think.”"
"“要我去吗？”查理问道。","“Shall I go?” asked Charley."
"“不行不行。”费金回答，“你疯了吗，亲爱的，彻底疯了，你也会进到那儿的——不，查理，不。一次失去一个人就够了。”","“Not for the world,” replied Fagin.“Are you mad, my dear, stark mad, that you’d walk into the very place where—No, Charley, no.One is enough to lose at a time.”"
"“我猜，你不会是想要自己亲自去吧？”查理滑稽地挤了挤眼，不怀好意地说。","“You don’t mean to go yourself, I suppose?” said Charley with a humorous leer."
"“那也不是很合适。”费金摇摇头回答道。","“That wouldn’t quite fit,” replied Fagin shaking his head."
"“那你干嘛不让这个新人去？”贝茨少爷把手搭在诺亚的胳膊上，问道，“没人认识他。”","“Then why don’t you send this new cove?” asked Master Bates, laying his hand on Noah’s arm.“Nobody knows him.”"
"“哎，如果他不介意的话——”费金说。","“Why, if he didn’t mind—” observed Fagin."
"“介意！”查理插嘴道。“他怎么会介意？”","“Mind!” interposed Charley.“What should he have to mind?”"
"“倒真是没什么，亲爱的，”费金说着，转过身面向博尔特先生，“倒是没什么可介意的。”","“Really nothing, my dear,” said Fagin, turning to Mr. Bolter, “really nothing.”"
"“哦，我斗胆说两句，你知道。”诺亚说着，一边朝门口退去，一边摇着头，脸上带着一种煞有介事的恐慌。“不，不——那不行。那种事可不在我的工作范围之内，不在。”","“Oh, I dare say about that, yer know,” observed Noah, backing towards the door, and shaking his head with a kind of sober alarm.“No, no—none of that. It’s not in my department, that ain’t.”"
"“他接受了什么工作任务，费金？”贝茨少爷问道，极其厌恶地打量着诺亚瘦长的身形。“一有什么不对劲就走人，而一切正常的时候就大吃大喝，这就是他的分内事？”","“Wot department has he got, Fagin?” inquired Master Bates, surveying Noah’s lank form with much disgust. “The cutting away when there’s anything wrong, and the eating all the wittles when there’s everything right; is that his branch?”"
"“这样算什么，”博尔特反驳道，“不许对前辈这么没规矩，小伙子，小心找错了人。”","“Never mind,” retorted Mr. Bolter; “and don’t yer take liberties with yer superiors, little boy, or yer’ll find yerself in the wrong shop.”"
"听到这一番义正言辞的威胁，贝茨少爷不可抑制地大笑起来，费金过了好一会儿才找到机会插上话，向博尔特先生保证造访警察局不会有任何危险。鉴于还没有任何关于他曾插手过的那件小事的记录，也没有任何对他本人的描述传到首都来，很可能没有人会怀疑他已经躲到首都来了；另外，如果他乔装打扮得很好，去到那里只会和去伦敦其他任何地方一样安全，因为在所有地点中，最让人们想不到的就是他会自愿前往警局。","Master Bates laughed so vehemently at this magnificent threat, that it was some time before Fagin could interpose, and represent to Mr. Bolter that he incurred no possible danger in visiting the police-office;that, inasmuch as no account of the little affair in which he had engaged, nor any description of his person, had yet been forwarded to the metropolis, it was very probable that he was not even suspected of having resorted to it for shelter;and that, if he were properly disguised, it would be as safe a spot for him to visit as any in London, inasmuch as it would be, of all places, the very last, to which he could be supposed likely to resort of his own free will."
"博尔特给说服了，部分是因为这些理由，但更主要的是他屈服于对费金的极大恐惧。他最终极不情愿地接受了这么一次探险。根据费金的指示，他立刻换下了自己的一套衣服，穿上一件赶车人的长罩衫，平绒裤子，裹上皮绑腿，这些都是犹太佬手边现成的。他还戴上了一顶毛毡帽子，上面插着几张过路税票，手里还拿着一根车夫的鞭子。这么打扮好了，他就准备闲逛到警局里去，正像个考文特市场来的乡巴佬，人家会以为他是为了满足好奇心而来的；他本来就笨拙难看，而且骨瘦如柴的，简直像极了，正适合扮演这个角色，费金一点儿都不担心。","Persuaded, in part, by these representations, but overborne in a much greater degree by his fear of Fagin, Mr. Bolter at length consented, with a very bad grace, to undertake the expedition.By Fagin’s directions, he immediately substituted for his own attire, a waggoner’s frock, velveteen breeches, and leather leggings: all of which articles the Jew had at hand.He was likewise furnished with a felt hat well garnished with turnpike tickets; and a carter’s whip.Thus equipped, he was to saunter into the office, as some country fellow from Covent Garden market might be supposed to do for the gratification of his curiousity; and as he was as awkward, ungainly, and raw-boned a fellow as need be, Mr. Fagin had no fear but that he would look the part to perfection."
"做好这些安排之后，他们告诉了他一些能够认出机灵鬼的外貌特征，然后博尔特由贝茨少爷护送，穿过黑暗曲折的小路，直到来到离波雾街不远的地方。贝茨向他描述了警局的具体位置，还详细补充说他应该怎样径直穿过马路，直到走到那一边后，他应该摘下帽子走进房间。然后查理·贝茨催促他快点行动，答应在分手的地方等他回来。","These arrangements completed, he was informed of the necessary signs and tokens by which to recognise the Artful Dodger, and was conveyed by Master Bates through dark and winding ways to within a very short distance of Bow Street.Having described the precise situation of the office, and accompanied it with copious directions how he was to walk straight up the passage, and when he got into the side, and pull off his hat as he went into the room, Charley Bates bade him hurry on alone, and promised to bide his return on the spot of their parting."
"诺亚·克雷波尔，或者如果读者愿意也可以叫他莫里斯·博尔特，准确地遵照得到的指示行事——贝茨少爷对这地方相当熟悉，指示十分准确，因此他一路上不需要再问什么人，也没遇到什么障碍，就进了地方法庭。","Noah Claypole, or Morris Bolter as the reader pleases, punctually followed the directions he had received, which—Master Bates being pretty well acquainted with the locality—were so exact that he was enabled to gain the magisterial presence without asking any question, or meeting with any interruption by the way."
"他发现自己挤在一群人当中，多数是妇女，大家聚集在一间肮脏、闷热的房间里。房间前头有一个用栏杆隔开的、高出来的台子，左手靠墙的地方是囚犯的被告席，中间是证人席，右边的桌子是地方法官的审判席；最后提到的那个可怕的位置给一道隔断遮住了，这样普通民众就看不到审判席，而这班粗人就只能自己去想象法官的无限庄严（如果他们能够想象出的话）。","He found himself jostled among a crowd of people, chiefly women, who were huddled together in a dirty frowsy room, at the upper end of which was a raised platform railed off from the rest, with a dock for the prisoners on the left hand against the wall, a box for the witnesses in the middle, and a desk for the magistrates on the right;the awful locality last named, being screened off by a partition which concealed the bench from the common gaze, and left the vulgar to imagine (if they could) the full majesty of justice."
"只有几个女人坐在被告席上，朝仰慕她们的朋友们点头，书记员正向几位警察和一位衣着平实的、伏在桌上的男人读着几份证词。一位看守倚在被告席的栏杆上站着，无精打采地用一把大钥匙轻敲着鼻子，偶尔大喊一声“肃静”，以制止一群闲人不合时宜的交谈倾向；有时，司法的庄严给营养不良的婴孩微弱的哭声打断，那孩子半露在母亲的襁褓之外，这时看守就神色严肃地抬起脸来，命令女人“把孩子带出去”。房间里有股闷热而不舒服的气味，灰尘遮住了墙壁本来的颜色，屋顶也成了黑的。壁炉架上摆着一尊陈旧的、被烟熏过的半身塑像，被告席上方挂着一只布满灰尘的钟——这是房间里看起来唯一正常运转的东西；堕落、贫困，或者两者兼具，已经在屋里所有活物的身上留下了痕迹，这同那些积着一层厚厚的油腻污渍，在旁皱眉观望的每一件没有生命的东西相比，几乎同样令人生厌。","There were only a couple of women in the dock, who were nodding to their admiring friends, while the clerk read some depositions to a couple of policemen and a man in plain clothes who leant over the table.A jailer stood reclining against the dock-rail, tapping his nose listlessly with a large key, except when he repressed an undue tendency to conversation among the idlers, by proclaiming silence; or looked sternly up to bid some woman “Take that baby out,” when the gravity of justice was disturbed by feeble cries, half-smothered in the mother’s shawl, from some meagre infant.The room smelt close and unwholesome; the walls were dirt-discoloured; and the ceiling blackened.There was an old smoky bust over the mantel-shelf, and a dusty clock above the dock—the only thing present, that seemed to go on as it ought; for depravity, or poverty, or an habitual acquaintance with both, had left a taint on all the animate matter, hardly less unpleasant than the thick greasy scum on every inamimate object that frowned upon it."
"诺亚急切地四下张望着，寻找机灵鬼的身影；但是，虽然有那么几个女人可以很好地胜任这位著名人士的母亲或姐妹一职，也有不止一个男人看起来很像他的父亲，诺亚却看不到一个符合自己被告知的关于道金斯先生特征的人。他心里焦急万分，忐忑不安地等待着，直到那两个被判收监再审的女人趾高气扬地走出去，接着又走进来一个犯人，诺亚立刻松了口气，那不是别人，正是他要探访的对象。","Noah looked eagerly about him for the Dodger; but although there were several women who would have done very well for that distinguished character’s mother or sister, and more than one man who might be supposed to bear a strong resemblance to his father, nobody at all answering the description given him of Mr. Dawkins was to be seen.He waited in a state of much suspense and uncertainty until the women, being committed for trial, went flaunting out; and then was quickly relieved by the appearance of another prisoner who he felt at once could be no other than the object of his visit."
"那的确是道金斯先生。他拖着步子走进法庭，宽大的外套袖子像往常一样卷了起来，左手插在口袋里，右手拿着帽子，身后跟着那个看守；他摇摇晃晃地走着，那步子难以形容。走到被告席的位置上，他用大家都能听见的声音问，为什么把他安置在这么个可耻的位置上。","It was indeed Mr. Dawkins, who, shuffling into the office with the big coat sleeves tucked up as usual, his left hand in his pocket, and his hat in his right hand, preceded the jailer, with a rolling gait altogether indescribable, and, taking his place in the dock, requested in an audible voice to know what he was placed in that’ere disgraceful sitivation for."
"“闭嘴，听到没有？”看守说。","“Hold your tongue, will you?” said the jailer."
"“我是个英国人，不是吗？”机灵鬼回嘴道，","“I’m an Englishman, ain’t I?” rejoined the Dodger."
"“我的权利到哪里去了？”","“Where are my priwileges?”"
"“你很快就能得到你的权利了。”看守反驳说，“而且是接连不断的权利。”","“You’ll get your privileges soon enough,” retorted the jailer, “and pepper with ’em.”"
"“要是我得不到我的权利，咱们就等着瞧，看看内政大臣会对这些法官说些什么吧。”道金斯先生回答，“喂！这里是怎么回事啊？我真是得感谢地方法官们亲自处理我这一点儿小事。要是他们看报纸时也没让我在这儿等着，我就更感谢他们了，因为我和一位绅士约好了在城里见面。我可是个言而守信的人，办公事时十分准时，如果我没能按时出现，他会走的；不过如果不让我等，我就不会起诉他们，让他们赔偿耽误我的损失了。哦，不，绝对不行！”","“We’ll see wot the Secretary of State for the Home Affairs has got to say to the beaks, if I don’t,” replied Mr. Dawkins.“Now then!Wot is this here business?I shall thank the madg’strates to dispose of this here little affair, and not to keep me while they read the paper, for I’ve  got an appointment with a genelman in the City,and as I am a man of my word and wery punctual in business matters, he’ll go away if I ain’t there to my time, and then pr’aps ther won’t be an action for damage against them as kep me away.Oh no, certainly not!”"
"这时，机灵鬼做出一副决心已定的样子，好像马上就要提出诉讼，希望看守通报一声“那两个坐在长凳上的、滑头的名字”。这让全体观众哄堂大笑，贝茨少爷要是听到了这一请求，一定也会这样开怀大笑的。“肃静，肃静！”看守喊道。","At this point, the Dodger, with a show of being very particular with a view to proceedings to be had thereafter, desired the jailer to communicate “the names of them two files as was on the bench.”Which so tickled the spectators, that they laughed almost as heartily as Master Bates could have done if he had heard the request. “Silence there!” cried the jailer."
"“什么案子？”一位地方法官问道。","“What is this?” inquired one of the magistrates."
"“是扒手案，大人。”","“A pick-pocketing case, your worship.”"
"“那孩子以前上过庭吗？”","“Has the boy ever been here before?”"
"“他应当是来过很多次了。”看守回答，“他也几乎去过每一个地方了。——我——很了解他，大人。”","“He ought to have been, a many times,” replied the jailer.“He has been pretty well everywhere else.—I—know him well, your worship.”"
"“哦！你了解我，是吗？”机灵鬼叫道，抓住这句话不放。“很好。不管怎么说，这是人身诽谤。”","“Oh! you know me, do you?” cried the Artful, making a note of the statement.“Wery good.That’s a case of deformation of character, any way.”"
"于是又响起一阵笑声，紧接着又是一声“肃静”。","Here there was another laugh, and another cry of silence."
"“那么，目击证人在哪儿？”书记员说。","“Now then, where are the witnesses?” said the clerk."
"“啊！这才对。”机灵鬼补充道，“他们在哪儿？","“Ah! that’s right,” added the Dodger.“Where are they?I should like to see ’em.”"
"这个愿望很快得到了满足，一位警官站出来说，他看见犯人在人群里窥视一位不知姓名的绅士的口袋，并且的确从口袋里掏出一块很旧的手巾，犯人拿手巾在自己脸上试了试，便又小心翼翼地放了回去。鉴于这个原因，警官本人一靠近机灵鬼，就拘捕了他；经过搜查，在这个所谓的机灵鬼身上发现了一个银质的鼻烟盒，盒盖上刻着主人的名字。经查询《名绅录》，也已找到了这位绅士。绅士当场发誓说这个鼻烟盒是自己的，就是在他前一天从人群里挤出去时弄丢的，前面提到过。他当时也注意到人群中有一位年轻的绅士，特别卖力地挤出一条路，而那位绅士就是他眼前的犯人。","This wish was immediately gratified, for a policeman stepped forward who had seen the prisoner attempt the pocket of an unknown gentleman in a crowd, and indeed take a handkerchief therefrom, which, being a very old one, he deliberately put back again, after trying it on his own countenance.For this reason, he took the Dodger into custody as soon as he could get near him, and the said Dodger, being searched, had upon his person a silver snuff-box, with the owner’s name engraved upon the lid.This gentleman had been discovered on reference to the Court Guide, and being then and there present, swore that the snuff-box was his, and that he had missed it on the previous day, the moment he had disengaged himself from the crowd before referred to.He had also remarked a young gentleman in the throng, particularly active in making his way about, and that young gentleman was the prisoner before him."
"“孩子，你有没有什么要问这位证人的？”地方法官问。","“Have you anything to ask this witness, boy?” said the magistrate."
"“我不愿意降低身份跟他说话。”机灵鬼回答道。","“I wouldn’t abase myself by descending to hold no conversation with him,” replied the Dodger."
"“你到底有没有话要说？”","“Have you anything to say at all?”"
"“你听没听到，大人在问你有没有什么话要说？”看守问道，用胳膊肘碰了碰沉默的机灵鬼。","“Do you hear his worship ask if you’ve anything to say?” inquired the jailer, nudging the silent Dodger with his elbow."
"“请您原谅，”机灵鬼心不在焉地抬起头来说道，“你在跟我说话吗，兄弟？”","“I beg your pardon,” said the Dodger, looking up with an air of abstraction.“Did you redress yourself to me, my man?”"
"“我从没见过这么个彻头彻尾的小无赖，大人。”警官咧牙一笑说道，“你有没有什么想说的，你这个毛头小子？”","“I never see such an out-and-out young wagabond, your worship,” observed the officer with a grin.“Do you mean to say anything, you young shaver?”"
"“没有。”机灵鬼回答，“不在这里说，因为这儿不是讲公道的地方；除此之外，我的律师今天早晨在跟下议院的副议长共进早餐；但是我要在别处说，他也是，另外一大群有名望的熟人也是，他们会让这些法官希望自己从没给生下来，或者责怪仆人没在他们今早出门上庭审判我之前，把他们给挂在帽钩上。我要——”“好了！可以收监了！”书记员插嘴道，","“No,” replied the Dodger, “not here, for this ain’t the shop for justice: besides which, my attorney is a-breakfasting this morning with the Wice President of the House of Commons;but I shall have something to say elsewhere, and so will he, and so will a wery numerous and ’spectable circle of acquaintance as’ll make them beaks wish they’d never been born, or that they’d got their footmen to hang ’em up to their own hat-pegs, afore they let ’em come out this morning to try it on upon me.I’ll—” “There!He’s fully committed!” interposed the clerk."
"“把他带走。”","“Take him away.”"
"“来吧。”看守说。","“Come on,” said the jailer."
"“哦，啊！我会来的。”机灵鬼回答，用手掌刷了刷帽子。“啊！（面对审判席）你们这么害怕也没用；我不会宽恕你们的，半点儿都不宽恕。你们会为此付出代价的，我的好伙计们。我不跟你们计较！现在，如果你们跪下来求我，我就不走了。算了，带我去监狱吧！带我下去！”","“Oh ah!I’ll come on,” replied the Dodger, brushing his hat with the palm of his hand.“Ah! (to the Bench) it’s  no use your looking frightened; I won’t show you no mercy, not a ha”porth of it.—You’ll—pay for this, my fine fellers.I wouldn’t be you for something!I wouldn’t go free, now, if you was to fall down on your knees and ask me.Here, carry me off to prison!Take me away!”"
"说完这最后几句话，机灵鬼给揪着领子带走了，直到走到院子里他还威胁着要把这事闹到议会里去；然后，又当着警官的面，带着自我肯定的表情大笑起来。","With these last words, the Dodger suffered himself to be led off by the collar; threatening, till he got into the yard, to make a parliamentary business of it; and then grinning in the officer’s face, with great glee and self-approval."
"看见他给关进一间小小的囚室之后，诺亚赶快回到他与贝茨少爷分手的地方。他在那里等了一会儿，那位年轻绅士才来。贝茨少爷十分审慎，躲在一个隐蔽的地方没露面，他仔细地四处观望一番，直到确定这位新朋友并没有被什么不相干的人跟着，才走出来。","Having seen him locked up by himself in a little cell, Noah made the best of his way back to where he had left Master Bates.After waiting here some time, he was joined by that young gentleman, who had prudently abstained from showing himself until he had looked carefully abroad from a snug retreat, and ascertained that his new friend had not been followed by any impertinent person."
"这两人赶忙一起往回走，要将这一振奋人心的消息带给费金先生，那就是机灵鬼完全对得起他的栽培，正在为自己博得一个光荣的名声。","The two hastened back together, to bear to Mr. Fagin the animating news that the Dodger was doing full justice to his bringing-up, and establishing for himself a glorious reputation."
"第四十四章 到了向罗丝·梅莱履行承诺的时候，南希却无法赴约","CHAPTER XLIV The time arrives for Nancy to redeem her pledge to Rose Maylie. She fail."
"虽然那个名叫南希的姑娘精于一切诡计和掩饰的技巧，却也无法完全隐藏她已迈出的这一步在她心中的影响。她想起，那精明的犹太佬和残忍的赛克斯把那些瞒着其他人的阴谋诡计都告诉了她，因为他们都深信她是值得信赖的，而且对她从不怀疑。尽管这些诡计十分险恶，策划者又这样无法无天，而她对于费金也是万分憎恶，正是这个人带着她一步步地在罪恶与不幸的深渊中越陷越深，令她无法逃脱；然而有时，即使是对于他，姑娘也会感到心软，恐怕自己透露风声会使他落入已躲避多时的铁拳，而最终丧命在自己手里——虽然他得此命运也是罪有应得。","Adept as she was, in all the arts of cunning and dissimulation, the girl Nancy could not wholly conceal the effect which the knowledge of the step she had taken, wrought upon her mind.She remembered that both the crafty Jew and the brutal Sikes had confided to her schemes, which had been hidden from all others: in the full confidence that she was trustworthy and beyond the reach of their suspicion.Vile as those schemes were, desperate as were their originators, and bitter as were her feelings towards Fagin, who had led her, step by step, deeper and deeper down into an abyss of crime and misery, whence was no escape;still, there were times when, even towards him, she felt some relenting, lest her disclosure should bring him within the iron grasp he had so long eluded, and he should fall at last—richly as he merited such a fate—by her hand."
"但是，这些都只是思想上的一些动摇，她无法完全脱离旧时的同伙，然而，她能够坚定不移地认准一个目标，决不因任何顾虑而改变心意。她担心赛克斯，这本会使她更有可能在最后关头退缩；但是她已经同别人讲定要严守她的秘密，也没有留下任何可能暴露赛克斯行踪的线索；她甚至为了他的缘故而拒绝躲避那包围着她的所有罪恶以及苦难——她还能再怎么做呢！她决心已定。","But, these were the mere wanderings of a mind unable wholly to detach itself from old companions and associations, though enabled to fix itself steadily on one object, and resolved not to be turned aside by any consideration.Her fears for Sikes would have been more powerful inducements to recoil while there was yet time; but she had stipulated that her secret should be rigidly kept, she had dropped no clue which could lead to his discovery, she had refused, even for his sake, a refuge from all the guilt and wretchedness that encompasses her—and what more could she do!She was resolved."
"虽然她内心所有的挣扎都以这样的结果告终，这些不安却一遍遍地向她袭来，并在她身上留下印记。甚至几日之内，她就渐渐变得苍白消瘦。有时，她注意不到眼前发生的事情；以前她在谈话中总是最大声的，现在却常常无从开口。有时，她强颜欢笑，却感觉不到快乐，或者忽然之间又吵闹起来。她一言不发地坐着，神情低落，双手支着脑袋想事情。虽然她也竭力想振作起来，但这种努力只是比那些迹象更加明显地表现出她的惴惴不安，她脑里想的东西与她的同伴正谈论着的毫不相干。","Though all her mental struggles terminated in this conclusion, they forced themselves upon her, again and again, and left their traces too.She grew pale and thin, even within a few days.At times, she took no heed of what was passing before her, or no part in conversations where once, she would have been the loudest. At other times, she laughed without merriment, and was noisy without a moment afterwards—she sat silent and dejected, brooding with her head upon her hands,while the very effort by which she roused herself, told, more forcibly than even these indications, that she was ill at ease, and that her thoughts were occupied with matters very different and distant from those in the course of discussion by her companions."
"那是礼拜天的晚上，附近教堂的钟声开始报时。赛克斯和犹太佬正在谈话，但这时他们也都停下来聆听。姑娘蜷缩地坐在一张矮凳上，也抬起头来听着。十一点。","It was Sunday night, and the bell of the nearest church struck the hour.Sikes and the Jew were talking, but they paused to listen.The girl looked up from the low seat on which she crouched, and listened too.Eleven."
"“还有一个钟头到午夜。”赛克斯说，他起身拉起窗帘，向外看了看，又回到座位上。“外面又黑又暗。正是做生意的好时候啊。”","“An hour this side of midnight,” said Sikes, raising the blind to look out and returning to his seat.“Dark and heavy it is too.A good night for business this.”"
"“啊！”费金回答，“真可惜，比尔，亲爱的，连一笔可做的生意都没有。”","“Ah!” replied Fagin.“What a pity, Bill, my dear, that there’s none quite ready to be done.”"
"“你这回可说对了。”赛克斯粗声粗气地回答，“确实是可惜，我也有这种感觉。”","“You’re right for once,” replied Sikes gruffly.“It is a pity, for I’m in the humour too.”"
"费金叹了口气，失望地摇摇头。","Fagin sighed, and shook his head despondingly."
"“等到事情都上了轨道，我们非得把损失掉的时间都补回来。这就是我知道的。”赛克斯说。","“We must make up for lost time when we’ve  got things into a good train.That’s all I know,” said Sikes."
"“你说得对，亲爱的。”费金回答，大胆地拍了拍他的肩膀。“我很高兴听到你这么说。”","“That’s the way to talk, my dear,” replied Fagin, venturing to pat him on the shoulder.“It does me good to hear you.”"
"“你很高兴，确实！”赛克斯叫起来，","“Does you good, does it!” cried Sikes."
"“行了，就这样吧。”","“Well, so be it.”"
"“哈！哈！哈！”费金笑起来，好像这一让步使他松了口气似的。“比尔，你今晚真像你自己。这才是你。”","“Ha! ha! ha!” laughed Fagin, as if he were relieved by even this concession.“You’re like yourself to-night, Bill.Quite like yourself.”"
"“你那干瘪的老爪子搭在我肩膀上，我才没感觉像我自己。快点儿拿开。”赛克斯说道，甩开犹太佬的手。","“I don’t feel like myself when you lay that withered old claw on my shoulder, so take it away,” said Sikes, casting off the Jew’s hand."
"“这让你很紧张，比尔——让你想起自己给逮住了，是吗？”费金决定不放在心上，问道。","“It make you nervous, Bill,—reminds you of being nabbed, does it?” said Fagin, determined not to be offended."
"“这让我想起被魔鬼给逮起来了。”赛克斯反唇相讥，“你那副样子，除了你老爸，再找不出第二个人来了，我想他现在正烧着他那花白的红胡子吧；要不你就是根本没有爹，直接从魔鬼那里来的，我才不会对此感到惊讶，一点儿也不。”","“Reminds me of being nabbed by the devil,” returned Sikes.“There never was another man with such a face as yours, unless it was your father, and I suppose he is singeing his grizzled red beard by this time, unless you came straight from the old ‘un without any father at all betwixt you; which I shouldn’t wonder at, a bit.”"
"费金对这一番恭维不置可否，只是扯了扯赛克斯的袖子，手指着南希的方向。姑娘趁着刚刚那番谈话的时候戴上了软帽，这时正要离开房间。","Fagin offered no reply to this compliment: but, pulling Sikes by the sleeve, pointed his finger towards Nancy, who had taken advantage of the foregoing conversation to put on her bonnet, and was now leaving the room."
"“喂！”赛克斯叫道，“南希。这么晚了，你这小姑娘要上哪儿去？”","“Hallo!” cried Sikes.“Nance.Where’s the gal going to at this time of night?”"
"“没多远。”","“Not far.”"
"“这叫什么话？”赛克斯说，“听见我说话了吗？”","“What answer’s that?” retorted Sikes.“Do you hear me?”"
"“我也不知道是哪儿。”姑娘回答道。","“I don’t know where,” replied the girl."
"“我倒是知道。”赛克斯说，他这么说倒不是因为对姑娘要去的地方有什么意见，只是因为自己固执的脾气。“哪儿也不许去。坐下。”","“Then I do,” said Sikes, more in the spirit of obstinacy than because he had any real objection to the girl going where she listed.“Nowhere.Sit down.”"
"“我不舒服。我之前告诉过你了。”姑娘回答，“我想出去呼吸点儿新鲜空气。”","“I’m not well.I told you that before,” rejoined the girl.“I want a breath of air.”"
"“把脑袋伸出窗外不就行了。”赛克斯回答。","“Put your head out of the winder,” replied Sikes."
"“那还不够。”姑娘说，“我想到街上去。”","“There’s not enough there,” said the girl.“I want it in the street.”"
"“那你就别呼吸空气了。”赛克斯答道。他一边这样斩钉截铁地说着，一边站起身来锁上门，拔出钥匙，并从她头上摘下软帽，扔在一个旧衣柜顶上。“得了。”这强盗说，“现在回老地方安静地呆着，行吗？”","“Then you won’t have it,” replied Sikes.With which assurance he rose, locked the door, took the key out, and pulling her bonnet from her head, flung it up to the top of an old press.“There,” said the robber.“Now stop quietly where you are, will you?”"
"“别以为没了软帽就能留住我，不是这样的。”姑娘说着，脸色变得苍白。“你想干什么，比尔？你知不知道你在干什么？”","“It’s not such a matter as a bonnet would keep me,” said the girl turning very pale.“What do you mean, Bill?Do you know what you’re doing?”"
"“知道我在——哦！”赛克斯大叫起来，转向费金，“她疯了，你瞧，要不然她可不敢这么跟我说话。”","“Know what I’m—Oh!” cried Sikes, turning to Fagin, “she’s out of her senses, you know, or she daren’t talk to me in that way.”"
"“你是要把我往绝路上逼啊。”姑娘双手按在胸前，喃喃自语道，似乎是想要强按下怒火。“让我走，听见没有——现在——立刻。”","“You’ll drive me on the something desperate,” muttered the girl placing both hands upon her breast, as though to keep down by force some violent outbreak.“Let me go, will you,—this minute—this instant.”"
"“不行！”赛克斯说。","“No!” said Sikes."
"“费金，告诉他让我走。他最好这么做。这样对他好。你听见我说话了吗？”南希一面跺着脚一面哭喊着。","“Tell him to let me go, Fagin.He had better.It’s s ll be better for him.Do you hear me?” cried Nancy stamping her foot upon the ground."
"“听见你说话！”赛克斯坐在椅子里，转过身来面对着她说，“啊！要是过半分钟我还听见你说话，狗就会咬住你的脖子，把你那大声尖叫的声音撕裂。见什么鬼了，你这贱人。怎么回事？”","“Hear you!” repeated Sikes turning round in his chair to confront her.“Aye!And if I hear you for half a minute longer, the dog shall have such a grip on your throat as’ll tear some of that screaming voice out.Wot has come over you, you jade!Wot is it?”"
"“让我走。”姑娘心急如焚地说，接着一屁股坐在门口的地板上，说道，“比尔，让我走吧，你不知道你在干什么。你不知道，真的。我只去一个钟头——就让我去吧——求你了！”","“Let me go,” said the girl with great earnestness; then sitting herself down on the floor, before the door, she said, “Bill, let me go; you don’t know what you are doing.You don’t, indeed.For only one hour—do—do!”"
"“这娘儿们要不是彻底疯了的话，就把我的手脚统统砍下来！”赛克斯叫喊道，粗暴地抓住她的胳膊。“起来。”","“Cut my limbs off one by one!” cried Sikes, seizing her roughly by the arm, “If I don’t think the gal’s stark raving mad.Get up.”"
"“不让我走，我就不起来——你不让我走我就不起来——不——决不！”姑娘尖叫道。赛克斯观察了一分钟，瞅准机会，突然捉住她的双手，任凭她一路挣扎扭打，把她拖进隔壁的小房间里，推倒在椅子上，奋力按住她，然后自己在长凳上坐下。她时而挣扎，时而哀求，一直闹到十二点的钟声敲响。然后她终于筋疲力尽，不再坚持原来的要求。赛克斯给了个警告，夹杂着一通诅咒，让她今晚不准再想着出去，然后留下她慢慢缓过神来，自己回到费金那里。","“Not till you let me go—not till you let me go—Never—never!” screamed the girl.Sikes looked on, for a minute, watching his opportunity, and suddenly pinioning her hands dragged her, struggling and wrestling with him by the way, into a small room adjoining, where he sat himself on a bench, and thrusting her into a chair, held her down by force.She struggled and implored by turns until twelve o’clock had struck, and then, wearied and exhausted, ceased to contest the point any further.With a caution, backed by many oaths, to make no more efforts to go out that night, Sikes left her to recover at leisure and rejoined Fagin."
"“嘿！”强盗擦了擦脸上的汗说，“真是个古怪的姑娘！”","“Whew!” said the housebreaker wiping the perspiration from his face.“Wot a precious strange gal that is!”"
"“说得没错，比尔。”费金若有所思地回答道，“说得没错。”","“You may say that, Bill,” replied Fagin thoughtfully.“You may say that.”"
"“你说，她今晚是想出去干嘛？”赛克斯问，“说吧，你应该比我更了解她。那是什么意思？”","“Wot did she take it into her head to go out to-night for, do you think?” asked Sikes.“Come; you should know her better than me.Wot does it mean?”"
"“倔脾气，我猜是女人的倔脾气，亲爱的。”","“Obstinacy; woman’s obstinacy, I suppose, my dear.”"
"“哎，我也这么觉得。”赛克斯嘟囔着说，“我原以为把她训练好了，没想到还是这么可恶。”","“Well, I suppose it is,” growled Sikes.“I thought I had tamed her, but she’s as bad as ever.”"
"“还更坏了。”费金依旧是若有所思地说，“我从没见过她这样，为了这么点儿小事情。”","“Worse,” said Fagin thoughtfully.“I never knew her like this, for such a little cause.”"
"“我也没见过。”赛克斯说，“我觉得，她是不是血里染上了那热病，出不来了——嗯？”","“Nor I,” said Sikes.“I think she’s got a touch of that fever in her blood yet, and it won’t come out—eh?”"
"“很有可能。”","“Like enough.”"
"“要是她再这个样子，我就要给她放点儿血，不用找医生。”赛克斯说。","“I’ll let her a little blood, without troubling the doctor, if she’s took that way again,” said Sikes."
"费金点了点头，对这种治疗方法表示赞同。","Fagin nodded an expressive approval of this mode of treatment."
"“在我卧床不起的时候，她整日整夜地守在我身边；而你呢，你就跟头黑心狼似的，自己躲得远远儿的。”赛克斯说，“而且我们一直以来也太寒酸了，我想，无论怎样这都让她担心烦躁；给关在这里这么久，总让她觉得不耐烦——嗯？”","“She was hanging about me all day, and night too, when I was stretched on my back; and you, like a blackhearted wolf as you are, kept yourself aloof,” said Sikes.“We was poor too, all the time, and I think, one way or other, it’s  worried and fretted her; and that being shut up here so long has made her restless—eh?”"
"“没错，亲爱的。”犹太佬悄声回答道，“嘘！”","“That’s it, my dear,” replied the Jew in a whisper.“Hush!”"
"正当他说着，姑娘出来了，坐回到她原来的位置上。她的双眼又红又肿，前后摇晃身子，猛地抬起头来；过了一会儿，她突然放声大笑起来。","As he uttered these words, the girl herself appeared and resumed her former seat.Her eyes were swollen and red; she rocked herself to and fro; tossed her head; and, after a little time, burst out laughing."
"“嘿，现在她又换了个花样！”赛克斯说道，向他的同伴露出十分惊讶的表情。","“Why, now she’s on the other tack!” exclaimed Sikes, turning a look of excessive surprise on his companion."
"费金向他点了点头，让他先不要理她；几分钟以后，姑娘平静下来，又恢复了往常的样子。费金小声告诉赛克斯，姑娘已无复发的危险了，然后拿上帽子，向赛克斯道了晚安。走到门口的时候，他停了一下，四下张望一番，问有没有人愿意给他下楼时照个亮。","Fagin nodded to him to take no further notice just then; and, in a few minutes, the girl subsided into her accustomed demeanour.Whispering Sikes that there was no fear of her relapsing, Fagin took up his hat and bade him good-night.He paused when he reached the room-door, and looking round, asked if somebody would light him down the dark stairs."
"“去给他照个亮。”赛克斯一边往烟斗里塞烟草，一边说道，“要是他自己摔断了脖子，叫看热闹的观众扫了兴，那真是可惜了。给他点个灯。”","“Light him down,” said Sikes, who was filling his pipe.“It’s a pity he should break his neck himself, and disappoint the sight-seers.Show him a light.”"
"南希手里拿着蜡烛，跟着费金下了楼。到了走廊，他一根手指按在嘴唇上，靠近姑娘，轻声说道：","Nancy followed the old man downstairs, with a candle.When they reached the passage, he laid his finger on his lip, and drawing close to the girl, said, in a whisper."
"“怎么回事，南希，亲爱的。”","“What is it, Nancy, dear?”"
"“你什么意思？”南希同样轻声地回答道。","“What do you mean?” replied the girl, in the same tone."
"“所有这一切的原因。”费金说，“如果——他——”他用瘦削的食指往楼上指了指，“对你这么糟糕（他是个畜生，南希，冷酷无情的畜生），那你为什么不——”“什么？”姑娘问。费金停顿了一下，他的嘴几乎碰到了姑娘的耳朵，而眼睛则注视着她的双眼。","“The reason of all this,” replied Fagin.“If—he—” —he pointed with his skinny fore-finger up the stairs—“is so hard with you (he’s a brute, Nance, a brute-beast), why don’t you—” “Well?” said the girl, as Fagin paused, with his mouth almost touching her ear, and his eyes looking into hers."
"“现在不说了。以后再谈。我是你的朋友，南希，忠实的朋友。我有办法，秘密又保险的办法。要是你想报仇的话，就为那些他把你当狗一样对待的事——像狗一样对待！还不如他的狗呢，他有时还和狗玩——你就来找我吧。我说，来找我。你跟他认识的时间不长，但是咱们可是老朋友了，南希。”","“No matter just now.We’ll talk of this again.You have a friend in me, Nance; a staunch friend.I have the means at hand, quiet and close.If you want revenge on those that treat you like a dog—like a dog! worse than his dog, for he humours him sometimes—come to me.I say, come to me.He is the mere hound of a day, but you know me of old, Nance.”"
"“我很了解你。”姑娘回答道，丝毫不露感情。“晚安。”","“I know you well,” replied the girl, without manifesting the least emotion.“Good-night.”"
"费金伸出手来，想要放在她的手上，但她却向后退了一步，又道了晚安，声音平稳；接着她心领神会地点点头，算是对他临别一瞥的回应，然后关上了门。","She shrank back, as Fagin offered to lay his hand on hers, but said good-night again, in a steady voice, and, answering his parting look with a nod of intelligence, closed the door between them."
"费金向自己家里走去，专心地想着脑子里的事情。他已经想到——不是由刚才那一幕得出的，虽然那也进一步使他确定，而是渐渐地、一步步得出来的——南希已不堪忍受那个强盗的残忍野蛮，她找到了些新朋友。她性情大变，总是单独离家，以前她总是对团伙利益十分上心，如今却不那么感兴趣了。另外，今天晚上她不顾死活，非要在某一时刻离家，这一切都印证了费金的猜想，而且，至少在他看来，这几乎已经是确凿无疑的事情了。她的这位新欢并不在他的忠实追随者中间。有了南希这个帮手，从他身上肯定能捞上一大笔，（费金这样想着）必须赶紧弄到手。","Fagin walked towards his home, intent upon the thoughts that were working within his brain.He had conceived the idea—not from what had just passed though that had tended to confirm him, but slowly and by degrees—that Nancy, wearied of the housebreaker’s brutality, had conceived an attachment for some new friend.Her altered manner, her repeated absences from home alone, her comparative indifference to the interests of the gang for which she had once been so zealous, and, added to these, her desperate impatience to leave home that night at a particular hour, all favoured the supposition, and rendered it, to him at least, almost matter of certainty.The object of this new liking was not among his myrmidons.He would be a valuable acquisition with such an assistant as Nancy, and must (thus Fagin argued) be secured without delay."
"同时还有另外一个更为邪恶的目标需要实现。赛克斯知道的太多了，他那些粗鲁刺耳的嘲讽给费金带来的伤害虽然无法看见，但因此产生的仇恨却丝毫不减。那姑娘肯定清楚，要是甩了他，她一定逃不出他怒不可遏的报复，而且这报复一定是要实现在她那位新欢身上，直到弄得个缺胳膊少腿，甚至丧命他才罢休。","There was another, and a darker object, to be gained.Sikes knew too much, and his ruffian taunts had not galled Fagin the less, because the wounds were hidden.The girl must know, well, that if she shook him off, she could never be safe from his fury, and that it would be surely wreaked—to the maiming of limbs, or perhaps the loss of life—on the object of her more recent fancy."
"“只要略加劝诱，”费金想，“她除了会同意对他下毒，还能怎么样呢？女人们总是这么做，甚至更残忍，只为了达到此前的一贯目的。那个危险的混蛋，那个让我憎恨的家伙，就等死吧；会有人填他的位置的，那姑娘有这个杀人的把柄在我手上，肯定任我摆布。”","“With a little persuasion,” thought Fagin, “what more likely than that she would consent to poison him?Women have done such things, and worse, to secure the same object before now.There would be the dangerous villain: the man I hate: gone; another secured in his place; and my influence over the girl, with a knowledge of this crime to back it, unlimited.”"
"刚才，费金独自坐在那个强盗屋里，短短的时间里，他脑子里尽想着这些事。对他来说，这些是最重要的事。后来他瞅准时机，在临别时向那姑娘断断续续地做出了暗示。姑娘没有表现出惊讶的表情，也没有表现出不明白他的意思。她显然已经了解了他的意思。从她告别时的一瞥就能看出。","These things passed through the mind of Fagin, during the short time he sat alone, in the housebreaker’s room; and with them uppermost in his thoughts, he had taken the opportunity afterwards afforded him, of sounding the girl in the broken hints he threw out at parting.There was no expression of surprise, no assumption of an inability to understand his meaning.The girl clearly comprehended it.Her glance at parting showed that."
"但是，也许她会在谋害赛克斯这一阴谋面前退缩，而这个阴谋是最重要的，必须实现。“那么究竟，”费金缓慢地走回家，想着，“我该怎么样加大对她的控制呢？我还能怎么再加把力呢？”","But perhaps she would recoil from a plot to take the life of Sikes, and that was one of the chief ends to be attained.“How,” thought Fagin, as he crept homeward, “can I increase my influence with her?What new power can I acquire?”"
"这样的脑子在紧急时刻最为灵光。即使不能逼她就范的话，他也能用个暗探，找到她新近结识的对象，然后威胁说，除非她加入他的计划，要不然就将整件事告诉赛克斯（她对赛克斯可不是一般地害怕），这样他还怕她不顺从？","Such brains are fertile in expedients.If, without extracting a confession from herself, he laid a watch, discovered the object of her altered regard, and threatened to reveal the whole history to Sikes (of whom she stood in no common fear) unless she entered into his designs, could he not secure her compliance?"
"“我可以的。”费金差点儿脱口而出，“到那时她可不敢不由我。又不是要她的命，不是要她的命！我有绝对把握。办法已经想到了，接下来就该付诸行动了。肯定能得到你！”","“I can,” said Fagin, almost aloud.“She durst not refuse me then.Not for her life, not for her life!I have it all.The means are ready, and shall be set to work.I shall have you yet!”"
"他扭头恶狠狠地看了一眼跟那无耻的混蛋分手的地方，还做了个威胁的手势，然后继续赶路。他那双皮包骨头的手不停地使劲拧着身上那件破烂外套的褶缝，好像手指的每一个动作都能把一个憎恨的敌人碾成粉末。","He cast back a dark look, and a threatening motion of the hand, towards the spot where he had left the bolder villain; and went on his way: busying his bony hands in the folds of his tattered garment, which he wrenched tightly in his grasp, as though there were a hated enemy crushed with every motion of his fingers."

"老人第二天一大早就起身了，不耐烦地等着自己的新伙计露面。这位伙计耽搁了很久才姗姗来迟，来了就马上狼吞虎咽地吃起早饭来。“博尔特。”费金一边说，一边拉过一把椅子，坐在莫里斯·博尔特对面。","The old man was up, betimes, next morning, and waited impatiently for the appearance of his new associate, who after a delay that seemed interminable, at length presented himself, and commenced a voracious assault on the breakfast. “Bolter,” said Fagin, drawing up a chair and seating himself opposite Morris Bolter."
"“嗯，我在这儿。”诺亚回答，“什么事？在我吃完饭之前别叫我做任何事。这真是这地方一个挺严重的毛病。吃顿饭的时间从来都不给够。”","“Well, here I am,” returned Noah.“What’s the matter?Don’t yer ask me to do anything till I have done eating.That’s a great fault in this place.Yer never get time enough over yer meals.”"
"“你可以一边吃一边说，对吧？”费金说,心底里却暗自咒骂他这位亲爱的年轻伙计真是贪吃。","“You can talk as you eat, can’t you?” said Fagin, cursing his dear young friend’s greediness from the very bottom of his heart."
"“哦，当然可以。边吃边谈还更自在些。”诺亚说着，切下一片大得惊人的面包。“夏洛特呢？”","“Oh yes, I can talk.I get on better when I talk,” said Noah, cutting a monstrous slice of bread.“Where’s Charlotte?”"
"“出去了。”费金说，“今天早上，我让她跟另外一位小姐出去了，因为我想单独跟你呆在一起。”","“Out,” said Fagin.“I sent her out this morning with the other young woman, because I wanted us to be alone.”"
"“哦！”诺亚说，“你应该让她先做一些抹了黄油的面包。好吧。继续说吧。你不会妨碍到我的。”","“Oh!” said Noah.“I wish yer’d ordered her to make some buttered toast first.Well.Talk away.Yer won’t interrupt me.”"
"的确，看起来不用担心有什么事能够妨碍到他，他刚才坐下时，就很明显是下定了决心要大干一番。","There seemed, indeed, no great fear of anything interrupting him, as he had evidently sat down with a determination to do a great deal of business."
"“你昨天做得很好，亲爱的。”费金说，“很漂亮！第一天就赚了六先令九个半便士！你收娃娃税能大赚一笔的。”","“You did well yesterday, my dear,” said Fagin.“Beautiful!Six shillings and ninepence halfpenny on the very first day!The kinchin lay will be a fortune to you.”"
"“别忘了，还有三个品脱壶和一个牛奶罐。”博尔特先生说。","“Don’t you forget to add three pint-pots and a milk-can,” said Mr. Bolter."
"“忘不了，忘不了，亲爱的。那些品脱壶可是天才的表现，而且牛奶罐也简直是完美的杰作了。”","“No, no, my dear.The pint-pots were great strokes of genius: but the milk-can was a perfect masterpiece.”"
"“我想，对一个初学者来说，这个头开得还算不错。”博尔特先生自鸣得意地说道，“锅子是我从晾衣杆上取下来的，牛奶罐则是在一家酒吧外面放着。我想它要是淋了雨可能就会生锈了，或着凉了，你知道。呃？哈！哈！哈！”","“Pretty well, I think, for a beginner,” remarked Mr. Bolter complacently.“The pots I took off airy railings, and the milk-can was standing by itself outside a public-house.I thought it might get rusty with the rain, or catch cold, yer know.Eh?Ha! ha! ha!”"
"费金假装笑得真心实意；博尔特先生自己笑完了之后，又大吃大嚼了几口，吃掉了他的第一片抹了黄油的面包，接着自己又取了一片。","Fagin affected to laugh very heartily; and Mr. Bolter having had his laugh out, took a series of large bites, which finished his first hunk of bread and butter, and assisted himself to a second."
"“博尔特，”费金朝桌子俯下身去，说，“我想要你给我做一件事，亲爱的，需要格外小心谨慎。”","“I want you, Bolter,” said Fagin, leaning over the table, “to do a piece of work for me, my dear, that needs great care and caution.”"
"“我说，”博尔特回答道，“你可别推着我做危险的事啊，也别再让我到警局里去了。那些都不适合我，不适合，我告诉你。”","“I say,” rejoined Bolter, “don’t yer go shoving me into danger, or sending me any more o’ yer police-offices.That don’t suit me, that don’t; and so I tell yer.”"
"“这事一点儿都不危险——一点儿都不，”犹太佬说，“只不过是跟踪一个女人。”","“That’s not the smallest danger in it—not the very smallest,” said the Jew; “it’s  only to dodge a woman.”"
"“一个老女人？”博尔特问道。","“An old woman?” demanded Mr. Bolter."
"“年轻女人。”费金回答。","“A young one,” replied Fagin."
"“这我能胜任，我知道。”博尔特说，“我在学校的时候就是个固定不变的、狡猾的告密者了。我为什么要跟着她？要不要——”“什么都不要做，只要告诉我她去了哪儿，见了谁，如果可能的话，再告诉我她说了些什么；如果她去了条街的话，就记住是哪条街；如果进了屋，就记住是哪间屋，然后回来告诉我你得到的一切信息。”","“I can do that pretty well, I know,” said Bolter.“I was a regular cunning sneak when I was at school.What am I to dodge her for?Not to—” “Not to do anything, but to tell me where she goes, who she sees, and, if possible, what she says; to remember the street, if it is a street, or the house, if it is a house; and to bring me back all the information you can.”"
"“你给我什么报酬？”诺亚问道。他放下杯子，满脸热切地看着他的老板。","“What’s ll yer give me?” asked Noah, setting down his cup, and looking his employer, eagerly, in the face."
"“如果你做的不错，我就给你一英镑，亲爱的。一英镑。”费金说，希望能尽量引起他的兴趣。“对一件不能收获多少价值的任务，我从来都不会给这么多的报酬的。”","“If you do it well, a pound, my dear.One pound,” said Fagin, wishing to interest him in the scent as much as possible.“And that’s what I never gave yet, for any job of work where there wasn’t valuable consideration to be gained.”"
"“她是谁？”诺亚问道。","“Who is she?” inquired Noah."
"“我们中的一个。”","“One of us.”"
"“哦，天哪！”诺亚把鼻子一皱，叫起来,“你对她起了疑心，是不是？”","“Oh Lor!” cried Noah, curling up his nose.“Yer doubtful of her, are yer?”"
"“她找了些新朋友，亲爱的，我得知道他们是些什么人。”费金回答。","“She has found out some new friends, my dear, and I must know who they are,” replied Fagin."
"“我懂了。”诺亚说，“只是想认识认识他们，看看他们是不是正派人，嗯？哈！哈！哈！悉听吩咐。”","“I see,” said Noah.“Just to have the pleasure of knowing them, if they’re respectable people, eh? Ha! ha! ha!I’m your man.”"
"“我就知道你会这么说的。”费金大声说，为自己计划成功而欢呼雀跃。","“I knew you would be,” cried Fagin, elated by the success of his proposal."
"“当然，当然。”诺亚回答，“她在哪儿？我要在哪儿等着她？我要去哪儿？”","“Of course, of course,” replied Noah.“Where is she?Where am I to wait for her?Where am I to go?”"
"“这些，亲爱的，我都会告诉你。我会在适当的时候把她指给你看。”费金说，“你先准备准备，剩下的事就由我来操心吧。”","“All that, my dear, you shall hear from me.I’ll point her out at the proper time,” said Fagin.“You keep ready, and leave the rest to me.”"
"这天晚上，第二天晚上，再一天晚上，这位密探坐在家里，穿好了靴子，套上车夫的行头，只等着费金一声令下就开始行动。六个晚上过去了——六个漫长煎熬的晚上，每天夜里，费金都一脸失望地回家，简略地告诉诺亚现在还不到时候。第七天晚上，他比平时回来得早一点儿，脸上带着掩藏不住的欢喜。这天是礼拜天。","That night, and the next, and the next again, the spy sat booted and equipped in his carter’s dress: ready to turn out at a word from Fagin.Six nights passed—six long weary nights—and on each, Fagin came home with a disappointed face, and briefly intimated that it was not yet time.On the seventh, he returned earlier, and with an exultation he could not conceal.It was Sunday."
"“今晚她出门了，”费金说，“肯定是去办那件事，错不了。她整天都独自一人，而让她害怕的男人不到天亮是不会回来的。跟我来。快！”","“She goes abroad to-night,” said Fagin, “and on the right errand, I’m sure; for she has been alone all day, and the man she is afraid of will not be back much before daybreak.Come with me.Quick!”"
"诺亚一句话没说就起来了，犹太佬这种强烈的激动情绪也感染了他。他们悄悄离开家，急急忙忙地穿过迷宫似的街道，最终来到了一家酒吧前；诺亚认出，这就是他刚到伦敦的那天晚上呆过的那家酒吧。","Noah started up without saying a word; for the Jew was in a state of such intense excitement that it infected him.They left the house stealthily, and hurrying through a labyrinth of streets, arrived at length before a public-house, which Noah recognised as the same in which he had slept, on the night of his arrival in London."
"过了十一点钟，酒吧已经关门了。费金轻轻地吹了声口哨，门又缓缓地打开了。他们悄无声息地走了进去，门在他们身后关上了。","It was past eleven o’clock, and the door was closed.It opened softly on its hinges as Fagin gave a low whistle.They entered, without noise; and the door was closed behind them."
"费金和那个给他们开门的年轻犹太佬连悄声说话都不敢，只是打了几句暗语，向诺亚指了指那块玻璃，示意他爬上去，看看在邻屋里的人。","Scarcely venturing to whisper, but substituting dumb show for words, Fagin, and the young Jew who had admitted them, pointed out the pane of glass to Noah, and signed to him to climb up and observe the person in the adjoining room."
"“是那个女人吗？”他压着声音问道，几乎和呼吸声同样轻。","“Is that the woman?” he asked, scarcely above his breath."
"费金点点头，表示正确。","Fagin nodded yes."
"“我看不太清楚她的脸。”诺亚小声说，“她低着头，蜡烛在她身后。”","“I can’t see her face well,” whispered Noah.“She is looking down, and the candle is behind her."
"“呆在那儿。”费金悄声说。他朝巴尼做了个手势，让他下去。一转眼，这小伙子就走进了小房间，借口要给蜡烛剪烛心，把它移到了指定的位置，然后跟姑娘说了句话，使她抬起脸来。","“Stay there,” whispered Fagin.He signed to Barney, who withdrew.In an instant, the lad entered the room adjoining, and, under pretence of snuffing the candle, moved it in the required position, and, speaking to the girl, caused her to raise her face."
"“我现在看到她了。”密探大叫起来。","“I see her now,” cried the spy."
"“看清楚了吗？”","“Plainly?”"
"“一千个人里我也能把她给挑出来。”","“I should know her among a thousand.”"
"这时，房门开了，姑娘走了出来，他赶紧退下去。费金把他拉到一块帘子遮住的隔断后面，屏住呼吸；她就从离他们藏身之处几步远的地方走过去，从他们刚刚进来的那道门出去了。","He hastily descended, as the room-door opened, and the girl came out.Fagin drew him behind a small partition which was curtained off, and they held their breaths as she passed within a few feet of their place of concealment, and emerged by the door at which they had entered."
"“嘘！”把门的小伙子喊道，","“Hist!” cried the lad who held the door."
"“是时候了。”","“Dow.”"
"诺亚和费金交换了个眼色，冲了出去。","Noah exchanged a look with Fagin, and darted out."
"“左边。”小伙子轻声提醒，“向左走，走在马路那边。”","“To the left,” whispered the lad; “take the left had, and keep od the other side.”"
"他照做了。借着路灯的光线，他看见了姑娘那远去的身影，离他已经有段距离了。他在自认为谨慎的程度下尽可能地接近她，一直走在马路的对面，以便更好地观察她的举动。她紧张地接连两三次四处张望，还有一次停下来，让两个紧跟在她后面的男人走过去。她似乎越走越有勇气，步子也越来越坚定沉稳了。密探一直保持着差不多远的距离跟在她身后，监视着她。","He did so; and, by the light of the lamps, saw the girl’s retreating figure, already at some distance before him.He advanced as near as he considered prudent, and kept on the opposite side of the street, the better to observe her motions.She looked nervously round, twice or thrice, and once stopped to let two men who were following close behind her, pass on.She seemed to gather courage as she advanced, and to walk with a steadier and firmer step.The spy preserved the same relative distance between them, and followed: with his eye upon her."
"第四十六章 守约","CHAPTER XLVI The appointment kept  "
"教堂的钟敲响十一点三刻的时候，两个身影出现在伦敦桥上。走在前面的是个女子，她步伐敏捷迅速，急切地四处张望，像是在寻找期望中的某个目标；另一个则是个男人，鬼鬼祟祟地走在他能找到的、最黑暗的阴影里，他和女人保持着一定距离，并且调整步伐与她一致：她停下，他也停下；她继续走，他也偷偷摸摸地跟着，但是即使在追踪的兴头上，他也绝对不让自己赶在她前头。就这样，他们过了桥，从米德尔塞克斯来到了萨里河岸，那女人焦急地在行人中搜寻，这时她明显失望了，转过身来。她的举动很突然，但监视她的那个男人却并没因此放松警惕，他缩进桥墩上面一个凹进去的隐蔽处，并且伏在栏杆上，更好地隐藏身形，任她走过对面的人行道。当她走到和之前两人相距差不多远的距离时，男人才静静地溜出来，再次跟上了她。在大约桥中间的地方，女人停了下来。男人也停了下来。","The church clocks chimed three quarters past eleven, as two figures emerged on London Bridge.One, which advanced with a swift and rapid step, was that of a woman who looked eagerly about her as though in quest of some expected object; the other figure was that of a man, who slunk along in the deepest shadow he could find, and, at some distance, accommodated his pace to hers:stopping when she stopped: and as she moved again, creeping stealthily on: but never allowing himself, in the ardour of his pursuit, to gain upon her footsteps.Thus, they crossed the bridge, from the Middlesex to the Surrey shore, when the woman, apparently disappointed in her anxious scrutiny of the foot-passengers, turned back.The movement was sudden; but he who watched her, was not thrown off his guard by it; for, shrinking into one of the recesses which surmount the piers of the bridge, and leaning over the parapet the better to conceal his figure, he suffered her to pass on the opposite pavement.When she was about the same distance in advance as she had been before, he slipped quietly down, and followed her again.At nearly the centre of the bridge, she stopped.The man stopped too."
"这天晚上天色很暗。天气非常不好，在那个时间，那样的地方都没什么人在走动。就是有人，也是急匆匆走过，不太可能看见那个女人以及密切监视她的那个男人，就是看到了也肯定不会去注意。他们的外表也没有招来穷人缠扰不休的注视，几个贫民那晚碰巧走过那座桥，想找个冰冷的拱门或是没关门的小破屋睡觉。两个人就一言不发地站着，不跟人说话，也没有过路人跟他们搭腔。","It was a very dark night.The day had been unfavourable, and at that hour and place there were few people stirring.Such as there were, hurried quickly past: very possibly without seeing, but certainly without noticing, either the woman, or the man who kept her in view.Their appearance was not calculated to attract the importunate regards of such of London’s destitute population, as chanced to take their way over the bridge that night in search of some cold arch or doorless hovel wherein to lay their heads; they stood there in silence: neither speaking nor spoken to, by any one who passed."
"薄雾笼罩着河面，让停泊在各个码头的小船上，燃着的红色灯火的颜色变得更深了，也让站立在两岸的、黑黑的建筑物显得更阴暗模糊了。两岸那些被烟熏得污点斑斑的老仓库，从一大片密集的房顶和山墙中耸立出来，显得笨重呆滞。它们阴森森地对着河水皱眉，那水太黑了，甚至连它们笨重的身形都照不出来。老圣救世主教堂的塔楼以及圣马格纳斯教堂的尖塔，长久以来一直是这座古老石桥的巨大守卫，在阴暗中仍然可以看见它们。但桥下林立的船只和岸上密密麻麻散布的教堂尖塔，几乎都隐没在人们的视线之外。","A mist hung over the river, deepening the red glare of the fires that burnt upon the small craft moored off the different wharfs, and rendering darker and more indistinct the murky buildings on the banks.The old smoke-stained storehouses on either side, rose heavy and dull from the dense mass of roofs and gables, and frowned sternly upon water too black to reflect even their lumbering shapes.The tower of old Saint Saviour’s Church, and the spire of Saint Magnus, so long the giant-warders of the ancient bridge, were visible in the gloom; but the forest of shipping below bridge, and the thickly scattered spires of churches above, were nearly all hidden from sight."
"那女子焦虑地转来转去——同时，躲在暗处的人还在密切监视着她——这时圣保罗大教堂沉重的钟声宣告了一天的结束。午夜降临到这座拥挤的城市。宫殿、地下酒吧、监狱、疯人院，这些承载着生死轮回、健康疾病、尸体僵硬面容，以及孩子恬静睡眠的房间，都被午夜笼罩。","The girl had taken a few restless turns to and fro—closely watched meanwhile by her hidden observer—when the heavy bell of St. Paul’s tolled for the death of another day.Midnight had come upon the crowded city.The palace, the night-cellar, the jail, the madhouse: the chambers of birth and death, of health and sickness, the rigid face of the corpse and the calm sleep of the child: midnight was upon them all."
"午夜的钟声敲过了还不到两分钟时，离大桥不远的地方，一位年轻的女士在一位头发花白的老绅士陪伴下，走下了一辆出租马车，他们遣走马车，径直向桥走来。他们刚一踏上人行道，那姑娘就猛然一惊，立即向他们走去。","The hour had not struck two minutes, when a young lady, accompanied by a grey-haired gentleman, alighted from a hackney-carriage within a short distance of the bridge, and, having dismissed the vehicle, walked straight towards it.They had scarcely set foot upon its pavement, when the girl started, and immediately made towards them."
"他们一直向前走，同时向四周张望，似乎对极不可能实现的的事情不抱太大希望。这时那位新同伴突然加入了他们。他们停了下来，并发出一声惊呼，但是立刻噤声，因为就在那一刻，一个乡下人打扮的男人走到了近前——事实上是擦身而过。","They walked onward, looking about them with the air of persons who entertained some very slight expectation which had little chance of being realised, when they were suddenly joined by this new associate.They halted with an exclamation of surprise, but suppressed it immediately; for a man in the garments of a countryman came close up—brushed against them, indeed—at that precise moment."
"“别在这儿，”南希急忙说，“我不敢在这儿跟你们说。离开——别在大马路上——走下远处的台阶那里去！”","“Not here,” said Nancy hurriedly, “I am afraid to speak to you here.Come away—out of the public road—down the steps yonder!”"
"她一边这样说，一边用手朝自己希望他们去的那个方向比划，那个乡下人四下望了望，粗鲁地问他们干嘛占着整个人行道，然后就走了。","As she uttered these words, and indicated, with her hand, the direction in which she wished them to proceed, the countryman looked round, and roughly asking what they took up the whole pavement for, passed on."
"姑娘指的台阶在萨里河岸，和圣救世主教堂同在桥的一边，筑成了从河上登岸的阶梯。打扮成乡下人模样的男人已经神不知鬼不觉地赶到了那个地方，环顾了一下地形，走了下去。","The steps to which the girl had pointed, were those which, on the Surrey bank, and on the same side of the bridge as Saint Saviour’s Church, form a landing-stairs from the river.To this spot, the man bearing the appearance of a countryman, hastened unobserved; and after a moment’s  survey of the place, he began to descend."
"这些阶梯是桥的一部分，一共有三段。往下走，恰好到第二段阶梯末端，左侧石墙尽头处是一根面向泰晤士河的装饰性壁柱。从这里开始下面的阶梯变宽了，所以一个人转到墙的那个角落，肯定不会被上面任何人看见，哪怕只高出一个台阶。乡下人匆忙地环顾四周，发现了这个地方，而且似乎没有比这里更好的隐身处了，再说潮水已经退了，那里有足够的空间。他溜到旁边，背贴着壁柱等着，十分确定他们不会走下更低的地方，而且即使他听不到他们说什么，也能安全地继续跟着他们。","These stairs are a part of the bridge; they consist of three flights.Just below the end of the second, going down, the stone wall on the left terminates in an ornamental pilaster facing towards the Thames.At this point the lower steps widen: so that a person turning that angle of the wall, is necessarily unseen by any others on the stairs who chance to be above him, if only a step.The countryman looked hastily round, when he reached this point; and as there seemed no better place of concealment, and, the tide being out, there was plenty of room, he slipped aside, with his back to the pilaster, and there waited: pretty certain that they would come no lower, and that even if he could not hear what was said, he could follow them again, with safety."
"时间在这个偏僻的地方过得如此缓慢。而这位密探又是如此热切地想要看穿这个与预计完全不同的会面动机。他已经不止一次以为这事告吹了，并劝自己，他们不是在上面很远的地方停下，就是去了某个完全不同的地方来进行神秘的对话。他正要从藏身的地方现身，回到上面的路上，就听到了脚步声，紧接着就是几乎近在耳边的声音。","So tardily stole the time in this lonely place, and so eager was the spy to penetrate the motives of an interview so different from what he had been led to expect, that he more than once gave the matter up for lost, and persuaded himself, either that they had stopped far above, or had resorted to some entirely different spot to hold their mysterious conversation.He was on the point of emerging from his hiding-place, and regaining the road above, when he heard the sound of footsteps, and directly afterwards of voices almost close at his ear."
"他挺直身体靠在墙上，屏住呼吸，凝神聆听。","He drew himself straight upright against the wall, and, scarcely breathing, listened attentively."
"“这里够远了，”一个声音说，这显然是那个绅士的。“我不会让这位小姐再往前走了。很多人不相信你，连这里都不会跟你来的，但你看，我愿意迁就你。”","“This is far enough,” said a voice, which was evidently that of the gentleman.“I will not suffer the young lady to go any farther.Many people would have distrusted you too much to have come even so far, but you see I am willing to humour you.”"
"“迁就我！”被跟踪的那个姑娘叫道，“你真体贴，先生。迁就我！好啦，好啦，这不算什么。”","“To humour me!” cried the voice of the girl whom he had follow.“You’re considerate, indeed, sir.To humour me!Well, well, it’s  no matter.”"
"“哎，为什么，”绅士的语气和善些，“你把我们带到这个奇怪的地方有什么目的？为什么不让我在上面又亮堂又有人走动的地方和你说话，却要把我们带到这个又黑又暗的窟窿里来？”","“Why, for what,” said the gentleman in a kinder tone, “for what purpose can you have brought us to this strange place?Why not have let me speak to you, above there, where it is light, and there is something stirring, instead of bringing us to this dark and dismal hole?”"
"“我之前跟你说过了，”南希回答，“我害怕在那儿和你说话。我不知道为什么，”姑娘战栗着说，“但是今晚我感到害怕和恐惧，我几乎站不住了。”","“I told you before,” replied Nancy, “that I was afraid to speak to you there.I don’t know why it is,” said the girl, shuddering, “but I have such a fear and dread upon me to-night that I can hardly stand.”"
"“害怕什么？”绅士问道，听起来似乎有些怜悯她。","“A fear of what?”asked the gentleman, who seemed to pity her."
"“我几乎什么都不知道。”姑娘说道，“我希望自己知道。一整天，我脑中都充斥着像死亡和沾着血的裹尸布这种可怕的想法，还有一种仿佛被架在火上烧的恐惧。今晚，为打发时间，我读了本书，同样的东西又从书里冒了出来。”","“I scarcely know of what,” replied the girl.“I wish I did.Horrible thoughts of death, and shrouds with blood upon them, and a fear that has made me burn as if I was on fire, have been upon me all day.I was reading a book to-night, to wile the time away, and the same things came into the print.”"
"“这只是想象。”绅士安慰她说。","“Imagination,” said the gentleman, soothing her."
"“不是想象。”姑娘哑着嗓子回答，“我发誓，我看见书上每一页都用大大的黑体字写着‘棺材’二字——是的，而且今天晚上，在大街上，就有人从我旁边抬着一副棺材走去。”","“No imagination,” replied the girl in a hoarse voice.“I’ll swear I saw ‘coffin’written in every page of the book in large black letters,—aye, and they carried one close to me, in the streets to-night.”"
"“那没什么奇怪的。”绅士说，“他们也经常从我身边经过。”","“There is nothing unusual in that,” said the gentleman.“They have passed me often.”"
"“——那是真的棺材——，”姑娘争辩说，“这个不是。”","“—Real ones—,” rejoined the girl.“This was not.”"
"她的态度很异常，听到这些话，隐藏的窃听者顿觉毛骨悚然，血液里都冒着寒气。他听到那位年轻女士恳请姑娘冷静下来的甜美声音，他觉得自己从未听到过如此能让人减轻忧虑的声音，女士请姑娘不要让自己成为这种可怕幻觉的牺牲者。","There was something so uncommon in her manner, that the flesh of the concealed listener crept as he heard the girl utter these words, and the blood chilled within him.He had never experienced a greater relief than in hearing the sweet voice of the young lady as she begged her to be calm, and not allow herself to become the prey of such fearful fancies."
"“对她说话温和点儿。”年轻女士对她的同伴说，“可怜的人！她似乎需要这样。”","“Speak to her kindly,” said the young lady to her companion.“Poor creature!She seems to need it.”"
"“你们这些高傲虔诚的人该抬头看看今晚的我，然后祈祷地狱火焰和上帝惩罚的降临。”姑娘叫道，“噢，亲爱的小姐，为什么那些自称上帝子民的人不像你这样温柔亲切地对我们穷人呢？你年轻貌美，有他们失去了的一切，应该更骄傲一些，而不是如此谦逊。”","“Your haughty religious people would have held their heads up to see me as I am to-night, and preached of flames and vengeance,” cried the girl.“Oh, dear lady, why ar’n’t those who claim to be God’s own folks as gentle and as kind to us poor wretches as you, who, having youth, and beauty, and all that they have lost, might be a little proud instead of so much humbler?”"
"“啊！”绅士说道，“土耳其人洗净脸后，面朝东方进行祈祷，这些好人经历俗世的磨难后，脸上的笑容也被抹掉了，变得一成不变，总是面朝天堂最黑暗的一面。在异教徒和伪君子之间，我宁可把自己托付给前者！”","“Ah!” said the gentleman.“A Turk turns his face, after washing it well, to the East, when he says his prayers; these good people, after giving their faces such a rub against the World as to take the smiles off, turn with no less regularity, to the darkest side of Heaven.Between the Mussulman and the Pharisee, commend me to the first!”"
"这些话看起来是对年轻女士说的，但也可能是为了给南希恢复常态的时间。不一会儿，绅士自己和她说了起来。","These words appeared to be addressed to the young lady, and were perhaps uttered with the view of affording Nancy time to recover herself.The gentleman, shortly afterwards, addressed himself to her."
"“你上周日晚上不在这儿。”他说。","“You were not here last Sunday night,” he said."
"“我来不了。”南希回答，“我被强留下了。”","“I couldn’t come,” replied Nancy; “I was kept by force.”"
"“被谁？”","“By whom?”"
"“是我之前跟小姐说过的那人。”","“Him that I told the young lady of before.”"
"“我想，你应该没被其他人怀疑要把今晚我们到此谈的那件事泄露给任何人吧？”老绅士问。","“You were not suspected of holding any communication with anybody on the subject which has brought us here to-night, I hope?” asked the old gentleman."
"“没有。”姑娘摇摇头回答道，“要在他不知情的情况下出门，对我来说并不容易，要不是我出门前给他喝了点鸦片酒，上次也来不了。”","“No,” replied the girl, shaking her head.“It’s not very easy for me to leave him unless he knows why; I couldn’t give him a drink of laudanum before I came away.”"
"“在你回去前他醒了吗？”绅士问道。","“Did he awake before you returned?” inquired the gentleman."
"“不，他和其他人都没有怀疑我。”","“No; and neither he nor any of them suspect me.”"
"“很好。”绅士说，“现在听我说。”","“Good,” said the gentleman.“Now listen to me.”"
"“我准备好了。”姑娘在他停了一下后说。","“I am ready,” replied the girl, as he paused for a moment."
"“这位年轻女士，”绅士开始说道，“她向我以及其他几位信得过的朋友谈过你在大约两周前告诉她的事情。我承认最初怀疑过你是否完全可靠，但是现在我很坚定地相信，你是靠得住的。”","“This young lady,” the gentleman began, “has communicated to me, and to some other friends who can be safely trusted, what you told her nearly a fortnight since.I confess to you that I had doubts, at first, whether you were to be implicitly relied upon, but now I firmly believe you are.”"
"“我靠得住。”姑娘诚挚地说。","“I am,” said the girl earnestly."
"“我重申我坚定地相信这一点。为了向你证明我的信任，我毫无保留地告诉你，我们打算利用蒙克斯这个人的恐惧，逼问出那个秘密，不管这秘密会是什么。但是如果——如果——”绅士说，“没法逮住他，或是逮住了，却不能像我们希望的那样奏效，你必须供出犹太佬。”","“I repeat that I firmly believe it.To prove to you that I am disposed to trust you, I tell you without reserve, that we propose to extort the secret, whatever it may be, from the fear of this man Monks.But if—if—” said the gentleman, “he cannot be secured, or, if secured, cannot be acted upon as we wish, you must deliver up the Jew.”"
"“费金。”姑娘一边叫着，一边往后退。","“Fagin,” cried the girl, recoiling."
"“你必须供出那个人。”绅士说。","“That man must be delivered up by you,” said the gentleman."
"“我不会那么做的！我绝对不会那么做的！”姑娘回答，“费金是个魔鬼，他对我比魔鬼还可怕，但是我绝对不会那么做的。”","“I will not do it!I will never do it!” replied the girl.“Devil that he is, and worse than devil as he has been to me, I will never do that.”"
"“你不会？”绅士说道，似乎早料到这种回答。","“You will not?” said the gentleman, who seemed fully prepared for this answer."
"“绝不！”姑娘回嘴道。","“Never!” returned the girl."
"“告诉我为什么？”","“Tell me why?”"
"“一个原因是，”姑娘坚决地答道，“一个原因是，小姐知道而且会站在我这边，我知道她会的，因为她对我许诺过。而另一个原因是，他生活在邪恶中，我也过着不道德的生活，很多我们这样的人都干着同样的勾当，我不会供出他们的。他们中的任何一个人都可以供出我，但是他们没有，尽管他们不是好人。”","“For one reason,” rejoined the girl firmly, “for one reason, that the lady knows and will stand by me in, I know she will, for I have her promise:and for this other reason, besides, that, bad life as he has led, I have led a bad life too; there are many of us who have kept the same courses together, and I’ll not turn upon them, who might—any of them—have turned upon me, but didn’t, bad as they are.”"
"“那么，”绅士很快说道，好像这才是他一直想要达到的目标，“把蒙克斯交给我吧，让我来对付他。”","“Then,” said the gentleman, quickly, as if this had been the point he had been aiming to attain; “put Monks into my hands, and leave him to me to deal with.”"
"“要是他供出其他人怎么办？”","“What if he turns against the others?”"
"“我保证要是那样，他被逼说出了真相，这件事就作罢。要把奥利弗短暂经历里的一些事情公诸于众肯定很痛苦，一旦真相大白，他们会没事的。”","“I promise you that in that case, if the truth is forced from him, there the matter will rest; there must be circumstances in Oliver’s little history which it would be painful to drag before the public eye, and if the truth is once elicited, they shall go scot free.”"
"“如果得不到真相呢？”姑娘提醒。","“And if it is not?” suggested the girl."
"“那么，”绅士继续说，“只有你同意了，这个费金才会被绳之以法。在这种情况下，我想，我能向你表明原因，让你同意这样做。”","“Then,” pursued the gentleman, “this Fagin shall not be brought to justice without your consent.In such a case I could show you reasons, I think, which would induce you to yield it.”"
"“小姐是否能对此许诺？”姑娘问道。","“Have I the lady’s promise for that?” asked the girl."
"“是的。”罗丝回答，“我真心实意地承诺。”","“You have,” replied Rose.“My true and faithful pledge.”"
"“蒙克斯绝对不会知道你们是怎么知道的？”姑娘顿了一下说。","“Monks would never learn how you knew what you do?” said the girl, after a short pause."
"“绝对不会。”绅士回答，“消息会压在他头上，让他绝对连猜都没法猜。”","“Never,” replied the gentleman.“The intelligence should be brought to bear upon him, that he could never even guess.”"
"“我是个骗子，从小就生活在骗子中间，”姑娘又沉默了一会儿说，“但是我相信你的话。”","“I have been a liar, and among liars from a little child,” said the girl after another interval of silence, “but I will take your words.”"
"在得到这两个人的保证，确定这么做或许是安全的了之后，她就开始描述那个晚上自己一出来就被跟踪的酒馆的名字和位置。她的声音很低，窃听者甚至连大意也很难理解。从她不时停下的样子来看，那个绅士好像是在匆忙记录着她所说的信息。她详细解释了那地方的位置，从哪个地方监视它不会引起注意，以及蒙克斯最习惯出入那地方的几个晚上和具体钟点。为了能记起蒙克斯比记忆中更有说服力的相貌特征，她似乎想了一阵。","After receiving an assurance from both, that she might safely do so, she proceeded in a voice so low that it was often difficult for the listener to discover even the purport of what she said, to describe, by name and situation, the public-house whence she had been followed that night.From the manner in which she occasionally paused, it appeared as if the gentleman were making some hasty notes of the information she communicated.When she had thoroughly explained the localities of the place, the best position from which to watch it without exciting observation, and the night and hour on which Monks was most in the habit of frequenting it, she seemed to consider for a few moments, for the purpose of recalling his features and appearances more forcibly to her recollection."
"“他很高，”姑娘说，“人很结实，但是不胖，他走路总是偷偷摸摸的，不停地回头看，先看一边，再看另一边。别忘了，他的眼睛往里凹陷，比其他任何人都陷得深，仅靠这一点基本上就能认出他来。他脸很黑，像他的头发和眼睛一样；尽管他不会超过二十六或者二十八岁，但面容憔悴。他的嘴唇常常没有血色，被牙齿咬得非常难看。他一抽筋就很厉害，有时甚至咬得手上全是伤——你为什么吃了一惊？”姑娘突然停下问道。","“He is tall,” said the girl, “and a strongly made man, but not stout; he has a lurking walk; and as he walks, constantly looks over his shoulder, first on one side, and then on the other.Don’t forget that, for his eyes are sunk in his head so much deeper than any other man’s, that you might almost tell him by that alone.His face is dark, like his hair and eyes; and, although he can’t be more than six or eight and twenty, withered and haggard.His lips are often discoloured and disfigured with the marks of teeth; for he has desperate fits, and sometimes even bites his hands and covers them with wounds—why did you start?” said the girl, stopping suddenly."
"绅士神色匆忙地回答，说自己没意识到这么做了，并请求她继续说。","The gentleman replied, in a hurried manner, that he was not conscious of having done so, and begged her to proceed."
"“有一部分情况，”姑娘说，“我是从跟你说到的那酒馆里的其他人那儿知道的，我只见过他两次，而且每次他都裹着一件大斗篷。我想这是我能告诉你的，能认出他的全部特征了。等等，还有，”她又说，“他转头的时候，在他喉咙上很高的地方，你能从他领巾下面看见一部分，有一个——”“红色的印记，像是烧伤或是烫伤的？”绅士喊道。","“Part of this,” said the girl, “I have drawn out from other people at the house I tell you of, for I have only seen him twice, and both times he was covered up in a large cloak.I think that’s all I can give you to know him by.Stay though,” she added.“Upon his throat: so high that you can see a part of it below his neckerchief when he turns his face: there is—” “A broad red mark, like a burn or scald?” cried the gentleman."
"“这是怎么回事？”姑娘说，“你认识他！”","“How’s this?” said the girl.“You know him!”"
"年轻女士发出一声惊叫，有一会儿他们实在太安静了，窃听者都能清楚地听见他们的呼吸声。","The young lady uttered a cry of surprise, and for a few moments they were so still that the listener could distinctly hear them breathe."
"“我想是的。”绅士说道，打破了沉寂。“按照你的描述我应该认识。到时再看吧。很多人出奇地相像。可能不是同一个人。","“I think I do,” said the gentleman, breaking silence.“I should by your description.We shall see.Many people are singularly like each other.It may not be the same.”"
"他说话的时候带着装出来的漫不经心的表情，并向藏着的暗探那里走了一两步，这使得后者都能清楚地听到他的喃喃低语：“一定是他！”。","As he expressed himself to this effect, with assumed carelessness, he took a step or two nearer the concealed spy, as the latter could tell from the distinctness with which he heard him mutter, “It must be he!”"
"“好啦，”他说道，声音听起来好像回到了之前站的地方，“你向我们提供了很有价值的帮助，我希望你能有好报。我能为你做些什么吗？”","“Now,” he said, returning: so it seemed by the sound: to the spot where he had stood before, “you have given us most valuable assistance, young woman, and I wish you to be the better for it.What can I do to serve you?”"
"“不用。”南希回答。","“Nothing,” replied Nancy."
"“不要坚持那么说。”绅士又说，声音和语气亲切得能感动所有坚硬冷酷的心。“想一想。告诉我。”","“You will not persist in saying that,” rejoined the gentleman, with a voice and emphasis of kindness that might have touched a much harder and more obdurate heart.“Think now.Tell me.”"
"“不用，先生。”姑娘流着泪回答，“你什么也帮不了我。事实上我已经完全没指望了。”","“Nothing, sir,” rejoined the girl, weeping.“You can do nothing to help me.I am past all hope, indeed.”"
"“你在排斥你自己。”绅士说道，“你的过去是一堆令人沮丧的垃圾，你浪费了青春活力，把造物主只给每人一次，而且永远不会再度赐予的无价之宝白白挥霍了。但是，对于未来，你却可以保持希望。我不是说，我们能有力量使你获得内心的安宁，那要靠你自己去寻找。但是为你提供一处安静的避难所，在英国也好，若是你害怕留在这里，在某个其他国家也行；这不仅在我们能力范围之内，而且也是我们想要保护你的热切希望。在黎明到来之前，在河流被第一缕日光唤醒之前，你将被送到一个你以前的同伙完全找不到的地方，并且完全不留一点痕迹，就像你从这一刻起就要从地球上消失一样。来吧！我不想让你回去和任何一个老同伙说一个字，或是到任何一处老巢看一眼，或是吸一口那种空气，那对你来说就是瘟疫和死亡。趁着还有时间和机会，抛下所有这些吧！”","“You put yourself beyond its pale,” said the gentleman.“The past has been a dreary waste with you, of youthful energies mis-spent, and such priceless treasures lavished, as the Creator bestows but once and never grants again, but, for the future, you may hope.I do not say that it is in our power to offer you peace of heart and mind, for that must come as you seek it; but a quiet asylum, either in England, or, if you fear to remain here, in some foreign country, it is not only within the compass of our ability but our most anxious wish to secure you.Before the dawn of morning, before this river wakes to the first glimpse of day-light, you shall be placed as entirely beyond the reach of your former associates, and leave as utter an absence of all trace behind you, as if you were to disappear from the earth this moment.Come!I would not have you go back to exchange one word with any old companion, or take one look at any old haunt, or breathe the very air which is pestilence and death to you.Quit them all, while there is time and opportunity!”"
"“她就要被说服了。”年轻女士叫道，“她在犹豫，我确定。”","“She will be persuaded now,” cried the young lady.“She hesitates, I am sure.”"
"“我恐怕不是，亲爱的。”绅士说道。","“I fear not, my dear,” said the gentleman."
"“不，先生，我不要。”姑娘挣扎了一小会儿，回答道，“我和过去的生活绑在一起了。我现在嫌恶它、讨厌它，但是却不能离开它。我一定是走得太远了，回不了头了——可我不知道，如果不久以前你对我这么说，我应该也会一笑置之的。但是，”她匆忙地环顾四周，说道，“这种恐惧又来了。我必须回家了。”","“No sir, I do not,” replied the girl, after a short struggle.“I am chained to my old life.I loathe and hate it now, but I cannot leave it.I must have gone too far to turn back,—and yet I don’t know, for if you had spoken to me so, some time ago, I should have laughed it off.But,” she said, looking hastily round, “this fear comes over me again.I must go home.”"
"“家！”年轻女士重复道，特别强调了这个字。","“Home!” repeated the young lady, with great stress upon the word."
"“家，小姐。”姑娘说，“这么一个家是我工作了一辈子攒钱建立的。我们分开吧。我会被跟踪或是被别人看见的。走吧！走吧！如果我做的对你们有任何帮助的话，我所求的只是你们不要管我，让我走自己的路。”","“Home, lady,” rejoined the girl.“To such a home as I have raised for myself with the work of my whole life.Let us part.I shall be watched or seen.Go!Go!If I have done you any service all I ask is, that you leave me, and let me go my way alone.”"
"“没有用的。”绅士叹息道，“我们站在这里也许会危及她的安全。我们让她停留的时间可能已经超出她的预期了。”","“It is useless,” said the gentleman, with a sigh.“We compromise her safety, perhaps, by staying here.We may have detained her longer than she expected already.”"
"“是的，是的。”姑娘催道，“你们让我停留太久了。”","“Yes, yes,” urged the girl.“You have.”"
"“什么，”年轻女士叫道，“这个可怜人的人生会怎样收场啊！”","“What,” cried the young lady, “can be the end of this poor creature’s life!”"
"“怎样收场！”姑娘重复说，“看看你眼前，小姐。看看那黑暗的河水。你读到过多少这种故事，像我这样的人跳进河水之中，不会有活着的人关心、担忧，或者为此痛哭。这可能是几年以后，也有可能只是几个月之后，但我最终会走到这一步的。”","“What!” repeated the girl.“Look before you, lady.Look at that dark water.How many times do you read of such as I who spring into the tide, and leave no living thing, to care for, or bewail them.It may be years hence, or it may be only months, but I shall come to that at last.”"
"“别这么说，求求你了。”年轻女士呜咽着回话。","“Do not speak thus, pray,” returned the young lady, sobbing."
"“这事绝对不会传到你耳朵里的，亲爱的小姐，上帝保佑这种惨事不要发生！”姑娘回答，“晚安，晚安！”","“It will never reach your ears, dear lady, and God forbid such horrors should!” replied the girl.“Good-night, good-night!”"
"绅士转过身去。","The gentleman turned away."
"“这个钱袋，”年轻女士叫道，“看在我的份上，收下它吧，你有需要或是有麻烦了的时候多少能有些用处。”","“This purse,” cried the young lady.“Take it for my sake, that you may have some resource in an hour of need and trouble.”"
"“不！”姑娘回答，“我这么做不是为了钱。让我记着这一点吧。但是——给我一样你戴过的东西吧，我很想要点儿什么——不，不，不是戒指——你的手套或是手帕——任何你拥有过，而我又能保存着的东西，可爱的小姐。好啦。上帝保佑！上帝保佑你。晚安，晚安！”","“No!” replied the girl.“I have not done this for money.Let me have that to think of.And yet—give me something that you have worn: I should like to have something—no, no, not a ring—your gloves or handkerchief—anything that I can keep, as having belonged to you, sweet lady.There.Bless you!God bless you.Good-night, good-night!”"
"姑娘非常激动，绅士担心被人发现可能会让她遭到暴力虐待，这似乎让他决定，要像她请求的那样让她离开。","The violent agitation of the girl, and the apprehension of some discovery which would subject her to ill-usage and violence, seemed to determine the gentleman to leave her, as she requested."
"可以听见，脚步声渐渐远去，说话声也停止了。","The sound of retreating footsteps were audible and the voices ceased."
"年轻女士和她同伴的身影不一会儿就出现在桥上。他们停在了阶梯最高处。","The two figures of the young lady and her companion soon afterwards appeared upon the bridge.They stopped at the summit of the stairs."
"“听！”年轻女士一边聆听，一边叫道，“她在叫！我想我听见她的声音了。”","“Hark!” cried the young lady, listening.“Did she call!I thought I heard her voice.”"
"“不，亲爱的。”布朗洛先生悲哀地向后看了一下，回答道，“她没动，我们不离开她是不会走的。”","“No, my love,” replied Mr. Brownlow, looking sadly back.“She has not moved, and will not till we are gone.”"
"罗丝·梅莱逗留在那里，但是老绅士拉着她的胳膊，轻轻地用了一点力把她带走了。他们离开后，姑娘几乎全身一挺地倒在一级石阶上，心中的苦闷化为了痛苦的泪水一涌而出。","Rose Maylie lingered, but the old gentleman drew her arm through his, and led her, with gentle force, away.As they disappeared, the girl sunk down nearly at her full length upon one of the stone stairs, and vented the anguish of her heart in bitter tears."
"过了一会儿，她站了起来，脚步虚浮蹒跚地走上了街。那惊讶不已的窃听者一动不动地在原地呆了几分钟，非常谨慎地往四周环顾了好几眼，确认又只有他一个人之后，他才慢慢地从藏身之处爬了出来，用他下来时一样的方式，躲在墙的阴影下鬼鬼祟祟地往回走。","After a time she arose, and with feeble and tottering steps ascended the street.The astonished listener remained motionless on his post for some minutes afterwards, and having ascertained, with many cautious glances round him, that he was again alone, crept slowly from his hiding-place, and returned, stealthily and in the shade of the wall, in the same manner as he had descended."
"诺亚·克雷波尔走到上面，往外窥视了好几次，确认没人看到自己，才飞奔而去，撒开双腿向犹太佬的住处狂奔。","Peeping out, more than once, when he reached the top, to make sure that he was unobserved, Noah Claypole darted away at his utmost speed, and made for the Jew’s house as fast as his legs would carry him."
"第四十七章 致命后果","CHAPTER XLVII Fatal consequences"
"离天亮大约还有两个钟头，那个时间在秋季其实可能该称为深夜。街道寂静清冷，甚至各种声响都陷入了沉睡，而放荡和骚动也都摇摇晃晃地回家进入了梦乡。费金正是在这个寂静无声的时候，坐在他的老巢里等着。他的脸格外扭曲、苍白，充血的眼睛分外红肿，看着不太像个人，而是像某种可怕的幽灵，湿乎乎地爬出墓地，还受到恶魔的侵扰。","It was nearly two hours before day-break; that time which in the autumn of the year, may be truly called the dead of night; when the streets are silent and deserted; when even sounds appear to slumber, and profligacy and riot have staggered home to dream;it was at this still and silent hour, that Fagin sat watching in his old lair, with face so distorted and pale, and eyes so red and blood-shot, that he looked less like a man, than like some hideous phantom, moist from the grave, and worried by an evil spirit."
"他蹲坐在冰冷的灶台上，裹着一张破床单，脸面向立在旁边桌上的一支快要燃尽的蜡烛。他右手举起，放在唇边，似乎陷入了沉思；他用长长的黑指甲敲着几颗从牙齿脱落了的牙龈上露出来的尖牙，按说只有狗或老鼠才会长这样的尖牙。","He sat crouching over a cold hearth, wrapped in an old torn coverlet, with his face turned towards a wasting candle that stood upon a table by his side.His right hand was raised to his lips, and as, absorbed in thought, he hit his long black nails, he disclosed among his toothless gums a few such fangs as should have been a dog’s or rat’s."
"诺亚·克雷波尔直直地躺在地上一张床垫上，睡得很熟。老人不时地朝他瞟一眼，然后就收回目光继续盯着蜡烛；被烧了很久的蜡烛芯垂了下来，几乎变成了两截，热热的油脂滴在桌上结成了块，这些都清楚地显示他正忙着想别的事情。","Stretched upon a mattress on the floor, lay Noah Claypole, fast asleep.Towards him the old man sometimes directed his eyes for an instant, and then brought them back again to the candle; which with a long-burnt wick drooping almost double, and hot grease falling down in clots upon the table, plainly showed that his thoughts were busy elsewhere."
"事实上他确实是。他为自己的妙计落空而感到丢了面子，他憎恨那个竟敢和陌生人讨价还价的姑娘，他完全不相信姑娘拒绝出卖他是出于真心，对于自己失去了报复赛克斯的机会也非常失望。他害怕自己被抓，担心老巢被毁，畏惧死亡到来，这一切激起了一阵狂暴激烈的愤怒。这些暴怒的想法一个紧跟着一个，飞快地、不停地旋转着从费金的脑中掠过，各种邪恶的念头和最为黑暗的企图在他心里打转。","Indeed they were.Mortification at the overthrow of his notable scheme; hatred of the girl who had dared to palter with strangers; and utter distrust of the sincerity of her refusal to yield him up; bitter disappointment at the loss of his revenge on Sikes;the fear of detection, and ruin, and death; and a fierce and deadly rage kindled by all; these were the passionate considerations which, following close upon each other with rapid and ceaseless whirl, shot through the brain of Fagin, as every evil thought and blackest purpose lay working at his heart."
"他坐在那里，姿势一点都没变，看起来好像完全没有注意时间，直到他灵敏的耳朵似乎被大街上一阵脚步声吸引。","He sat without changing his attitude in the least, or appearing to take the smallest heed of time, until his quick ear seemed to be attracted by a footstep in the street."
"“终于来了。”他擦着自己干燥发热的嘴，喃喃自语，“终于来了！”","“At last,” he muttered, wiping his dry and fevered mouth.“At last!”"
"他说这话的时候，门铃轻轻地响了。他爬上楼走到门边，不一会儿和一个男人一起回来了，那个男人全身上下直到下巴都被裹着，胳膊下夹着一个包。坐下后，那男人把脱下的外套扔到一边，露出魁梧的身躯，这人正是赛克斯。","The bell rang gently as he spoke.He crept upstairs to the door, and presently returned accompanied by a man muffled to the chin, who carried a bundle under one arm.Sitting down and throwing back his outer coat, the man displayed the burly frame of Sikes."
"“你瞧！”他把包搁在桌上，说道，“把它收好，尽全力卖个好价钱。拿到它可费了不少功夫，我本以为三个小时前就能到这儿的。”","“There!” he said, laying the bundle on the table.“Take care of that, and do the most you can with it.It’s been trouble enough to get; I thought I should have been here, three hours ago.”"
"费金拿起那个包，把它锁在柜子里，一言不发地又坐了下来。但在这个过程中，他的目光一刻也没有离开那个盗贼。现在他们面对面坐着，费金紧紧盯着赛克斯，嘴唇抖得厉害，各种情绪主宰着他，让他的脸色变来变去，这使得那个强盗不知不觉地把椅子向后挪了挪，脸上带着真实的惊恐表情打量他。","Fagin laid his hand upon the bundle, and locking it in the cupboard, sat down again without speaking.But he did not take his eyes off the robber, for an instant, during this action; and now that they sat over against each other, face to face, he looked fixedly at him, with his lips quivering so violently, and his face so altered by the emotions which had mastered him, that the housebreaker involuntarily drew back his chair, and surveyed him with a look of real affright."
"“怎么？”赛克斯叫道，“你这么看着我干嘛？”","“Wot now?” cried Sikes.“Wot do you look at a man so for?”"
"费金抬起右手，在空中摇了摇发抖的食指，但他太激动了，一时间讲不出话来。","Fagin raised his right hand, and shook his trembling forefinger in the air; but his passion was so great, that the power of speech was for the moment gone."
"“该死！”赛克斯说道，一脸惊慌地抚了下胸口。“他疯了。我可得小心。”","“Damme!” said Sikes, feeling in his breast with a look of alarm.“He’s gone mad.I must look to myself here.”"
"“不，不。”费金找回了自己的声音，回答道，“不是——不是你，比尔。我没有——没有找你的麻烦。”","“No, no,” rejoined Fagin, finding his voice.“It’s not—you’re not the person, Bill.I’ve  no—no fault to find with you.”"
"“噢，你没有，是吗？”赛克斯说着，严肃地看着他，招摇地把手枪放进一个更方便拿出的口袋里。“这是运气——对我们中的一个来说。至于是哪一个，这不重要。”","“Oh, you haven’t, haven’t you?” said Sikes, looking sternly at him, and ostentatiously passing a pistol into a more convenient pocket.“That’s lucky—for one of us.Which one that is, don’t matter.”"
"“我有话要和你说，比尔，“费金把椅子拖近了点儿，说道，“这事会让你比我更难过。”","“I’ve  got that to tell you, Bill,” said Fagin, drawing his chair nearer, “will make you worse than me.”"
"“是吗？”强盗一副怀疑的样子回答道，“说吧！快点儿说，要不然南希会以为我出事了的。”","“Aye?” returned the robber with an incredulous air.“Tell away!Look sharp, or Nance will think I’m lost.”"
"“出事！”费金叫道，“她已经在心里把这事算计好啦。”","“Lost!” cried Fagin.“She has pretty well settled that, in her own mind, already.”"
"赛克斯以一副极度困惑的样子看着犹太佬的脸，在那儿没读出对谜团的满意解释，他用自己的大手抓住费金的外衣领子，狠狠地摇晃着他。","Sikes looked with an aspect of great perplexity into the Jew’s face, and reading no satisfactory explanation of the riddle there, clenched his coat collar in his huge hand and shook him soundly."
"“说，你快说！”他说道，“不然我让你喘不过来气。把嘴张开，把你要说的话明明白白讲出来。说出来，你这个遭雷劈的老杂种，说出来！”","“Speak, will you!” he said; “or if you don’t, it shall be for want of breath.Open your mouth and say wot you’ve got to say in plain words.Out with it, you thundering old cur, out with it!”"
"“假如躺在那里的那个伙计——”费金开始说。","“Suppose that lad that’s laying there—” Fagin began."
"赛克斯转过头去看诺亚正睡着的地方，好像之前压根儿没发现他。“好啦！”他恢复之前的姿势，说道，","Sikes turned round to where Noah was sleeping, as if he had not previously observed him.“Well!” he said, resuming his former position."
"“假如那个伙计，”费金继续道，“要告发——要把我们所有人搞臭——带着这个目的首先找到合适的人，然后在街上和他们碰面，描述我们的相貌，形容我们的每一个特征，让他们能借此认出我们，还告诉他们在哪里可以最轻易地逮住我们。假如他要去做这一切，另外还要供出我们多多少少都参与了的一桩事——这全出自他自己的幻想，他既没有被抓住，也没有中圈套，或是受到教区牧师的暗中唆使，更不是说没有吃的喝的——而是出于他自己的想法，为了满足他自己的口味，在晚上偷偷溜出去，找到对我们最感兴趣的那些人，向他们告密。你听见我说的了吗？”犹太佬叫道，眼中闪着怒火。“假如他做了这一切，那怎么办？”","“Suppose that lad,” pursued Fagin, “was to peach—to blow upon us all—first seeking out the right folks for the purpose, and then having a meeting with ’em in the street to paint our likenesses, describe every mark that they might know us by, and the crib where we might be most easily taken.Suppose he was to do all this, and besides to blow upon a plant we’ve all been in, more or less—of his own fancy; not grabbed, trapped, tried, earwigged by the parson and brought to it on bread and water,—but of his own fancy; to please his own taste; stealing out at nights to find those most interested against us, and peaching to them.Do you hear me?” cried the Jew, his eyes flashing with rage.“Suppose he did all this, what then?”"
"“怎么办！”赛克斯带着一种可怕的诅咒语气回答道，“如果在我来之前他还活着，我会用靴子的铁后跟把他的脑壳磨成粒，他脑袋上有多少根头发，就磨成多少粒。”","“What then!” replied Sikes; with a tremendous oath.“If he was left alive till I came, I’d grind his skull under the iron heel of my boot into as many grains as there are hairs upon his head.”"
"“如果是我做的呢！”费金几乎是嚷着说道，“我知道那么多事，除了我自己，我还能让很多人都被绞死！”","“What if I did it!” cried Fagin almost in a yell.“I, that knows so much, and could hang so many besides myself!”"
"“我不知道。”赛克斯咬着牙回答，仅仅听到这个假设，他脸就变白了。“我会在监狱里干件什么事，让他们给我戴上镣铐。如果我和你一起受审，我会戴着它们扑在你身上，在众目睽睽之下把你的脑浆打出来。我应该有这样的力气，”强盗扬了扬肌肉发达的手臂，喃喃低语，“我能把你的脑袋打碎，碎得像一辆装满货物的马车从上面碾过去了似的。”","“I don’t know,” replied Sikes, clenching his teeth and turning white at the mere suggestion.“I’d do something in the jail that ’ud get me put in irons; and if I was tried along with you, I’d fall upon you with them in the open court, and beat your brains out afore the people.I should have such strength,” muttered the robber, poising his brawny arm, “that I could smash your head as if a loaded waggon had gone over it.”"
"“你会这么干？”","“You would?”"
"“我会的！”强盗说，“你可以试试看。”","“Would I!” said the housebreaker.“Try me.”"
"“如果是查利，或是机灵鬼、贝特，或者——”“我不在乎是谁。”赛克斯不耐烦地回答，“不论是谁，我都会用同样的手段来对待他们。”","“If it was Charley, or the Dodger, or Bet, or—” “I don’t care who,” replied Sikes impatiently.“Whoever it was, I’d serve them the same.”"
"费金死死盯住强盗，示意他安静下来，然后弯身俯向地铺，摇摇正在睡觉的人，让他起来。赛克斯坐在椅子上向前倾了下，他双手放在膝盖上看着，好像非常疑惑所有这些询问和准备都是为了什么。","Fagin looked hard at the robber; and, motioning him to be silent, stooped over the bed upon the floor, and shook the sleeper to rouse him.Sikes leant forward in his chair: looking on with his hands upon his knees, as if wondering much what all this questioning and preparation was to end in."
"“博尔特，博尔特！可怜的家伙！”“可怜的家伙！”费金带着一脸邪恶的期待，说得很慢，非常明显地强调，“他很疲倦——因为监视她太长时间了才很疲倦——监视——她——，比尔。”","“Bolter, Bolter!Poor lad!”“Poor lad!” said Fagin, looking up with an expression of devilish anticipation, and speaking slowly and with marked emphasis.“He’s tired—tired with watching for her so long,—watching for—her—, Bill.”"
"“你是什么意思？”赛克斯缩回来，说道。","“Wot d’ye mean?” said Sikes, drawing back."
"费金没有回答，而是再次弯身，把睡觉的人拖成坐着的姿势。当他的假名字被叫了好几遍后，诺亚揉揉眼睛，打了个很大的呵欠，睡眼朦胧地看着他。","Fagin made no answer, but bending over the sleeper again, hauled him into a sitting posture.When his assumed name had been repeated several times, Noah rubbed his eyes, and, giving a heavy yawn, looked sleepily about him."
"“再把那事和我说一遍——再来一遍，正好让他听听。”犹太佬指着赛克斯说道。","“Tell me that again—once again, just for him to hear,” said the Jew, pointing to Sikes as he spoke."
"“告诉他什么？”昏昏欲睡的诺亚问道，怒气冲冲地晃了晃身子。","“Tell yer what?” asked the sleepy Noah, shaking himself pettishly."
"“那件关于——南希——的事。”费金说着，抓住赛克斯的手腕，好像要防止他还没听完就要离开这间屋子。“你跟踪她？”","“That about—Nancy—,” said Fagin, clutching Sikes by the wrist, as if to prevent his leaving the house before he had heard enough.“You followed her?”"
"“是的。”","“Yes.”"
"“去了伦敦桥？”","“To London Bridge?”"
"“是的。”","“Yes.”"
"“她在那儿见了两个人。”","“Where she met two people.”"
"“她是这么做了。”","“So she did.”"
"“那是一位绅士和一位小姐，南希以前主动去找过他们，他们让她放弃自己所有的伙伴，先是蒙克斯，她照办了——让她描述他的相貌，她那么做了——要她说出我们见面和常去的酒馆，她说了——从哪里可以最好地监视我们，她说了——大家什么时候去那儿，她也说了。她做了这一切。她在没有受到一点儿威胁的情况下，牢骚都不发一下地都说了——她说了——是不是？”费金叫道，又疯狂又愤怒。","“A gentleman and a lady that she had gone to of her own accord before, who asked her to give up all her pals, and Monks first, which she did—and to describe him, which she did—and to tell her what house it was that we meet at, and go to, which she did—and where it could be best watched from, which she did—and what time the people went there, which she did.She did all this.She told it all every word without a threat, without a murmur—she did—did she not?” cried Fagin, half mad with fury."
"“没错。”诺亚抓抓头回答，“事情就是那样！”","“All right,” replied Noah, scratching his head.“That’s just what it was!”"
"“关于上个星期天他们是怎么说的？”","“What did they say, about last Sunday?”"
"“关于上个星期天！”诺亚想了想，回答道，“我不是之前告诉过你了吗？”","“About last Sunday!” replied Noah, considering.“Why I told yer that before.”"
"“再来一遍。再把它讲一遍！”费金叫道，把赛克斯抓得更紧了，同时高高挥舞他的另一只手，唾沫横飞。","“Again.Tell it again!” cried Fagin, tightening his grasp on Sikes, and brandishing his other hand aloft, as the foam flew from his lips."
"“他们问她，”诺亚越来越清醒了，似乎开始明白赛克斯是谁了，“他们问她，上个星期天她为什么没按约定的那样过来。她说她没法来。”","“They asked her,” said Noah, who, as he grew more wakeful, seemed to have a dawning perception who Sikes was, “they asked her why she didn’t come, last Sunday, as she promised.She said she couldn’t.”"
"“为什么——为什么？告诉他。”","“Why—why?Tell him that.”"
"“因为比尔强迫她留在家里，她以前跟他们说起过这个人。”诺亚回答。","“Because she was forcibly kept at home by Bill, the man she had told them of before,” replied Noah."
"“还说了他什么？”费金叫道，“她以前还跟他们说了他什么？告诉他，告诉他。”","“What more of him?” cried Fagin.“What more of the man she had told them of before?Tell him that, tell him that.”"
"“哎，除非他知道她要去哪儿，否则她就没法轻易出门，”诺亚说，“所以她第一次去见那个小姐的时候，她——哈！哈！哈！她说这些的时候让我想笑，真的——她给他喝了鸦片酒。”","“Why, that she couldn’t very easily get out of doors unless he knew where she was going to,” said Noah; “and so the first time she went to see the lady, she—ha! ha! ha! it made me laugh when she said it, that it did—she gave him a drink of laudanum.”"
"“天杀的！”赛克斯叫道，猛烈地挣开犹太佬的手。“让我走！”","“Hell’s fire!” cried Sikes, breaking fiercely from the Jew.“Let me go!”"
"他粗暴地把老头推到一边，冲出了房间，狂野愤怒地奔上楼。","Flinging the old man from him, he rushed from the room, and darted, wildly and furiously, up the stairs."
"“比尔，比尔！”费金急忙跟着他，叫道，“听我一句。就一句。”","“Bill, Bill!” cried Fagin, following him hastily.“A word.Only a word.”"
"这句话本来没机会说出口的，但是那强盗打不开门，他徒劳地对着它咒骂，对它使着蛮劲儿，这时犹太佬气喘吁吁地爬了上来。","The word would not have been exchanged, but that the housebreaker was unable to open the door: on which he was expending fruitless oaths and violence, when the Jew came panting up."
"“让我出去。”赛克斯说，“别跟我说话，小心点儿。让我出去，我说！”","“Let me out,” said Sikes.“Don’t speak to me; it’s not safe.Let me out, I say!”"
"“听我说一句。”费金把手放在锁上，又说，“你不会——”“好吧。”另一个人回答道。","“Hear me speak a word,” rejoined Fagin, laying his hand upon the lock.“You won’t be—” “Well,” replied the other."
"“你不会——太——暴力吧，比尔？”","“You won’t be—too—violent, Bill?”"
"天要亮了，光线足够让两人看清彼此的脸。他们很快地互相看了一眼，双方眼中都有不容错认的怒火。","The day was breaking, and there was light enough for the men to see each other’s faces.They exchanged one brief glance; there was a fire in the eyes of both, which could not be mistaken."
"“我的意思是，”费金表明，他感到现在所有的伪装都没用了，“为了安全，不要太暴力。放机灵点儿，比尔，别太莽撞了。”","“I mean,” said Fagin, showing that he felt all disguise was now useless, “not too violent for safety.Be crafty, Bill, and not too bold.”"
"赛克斯没有回答，但是，费金一打开锁，他就拉开门，冲向了寂静的街道。","Sikes made no reply; but, pulling open the door, of which Fagin had turned the lock, dashed into the silent streets."
"赛克斯一刻不停，不做任何思考，一次也没有扭头左右顾盼，也没有抬眼看天，或是低头看地，他带着报复的决心直直往前看去。他把牙死死咬在一起，绷紧的下巴好像要把皮给戳穿了。这个强盗继续一路向前冲，一声不吭，绷紧全身肌肉，直到来到了自己家门前。他用钥匙轻轻开了门，迈开大步静静上了楼，走进自己的房间，给门上了两道锁，又搬了张很重的桌子抵住门，然后拉开了床帘。","Without one pause, or moment’s s consideration; without once turning his head to the right or left, or raising his eyes to the sky, or lowering them to the ground, but looking straight before him with savage resolution:his teeth so tightly compressed that the strained jaw seemed starting through his skin; the robber held on his headlong course, nor muttered a word, nor relaxed a muscle, until he reached his own door.He opened it, softly, with a key; strode lightly up the stairs; and entering his own room, double-locked the door, and lifting a heavy table against it, drew back the curtain of the bed."
"姑娘衣衫不整地躺在上面。他把她从睡梦中弄醒，她吃惊地看了他一眼，急忙坐了起来。","The girl was lying, half-dressed, upon it.He had roused her from her sleep, for she raised herself with a hurried and startled look."
"“起来！”男人说。","“Get up!” cried the man."
"“是你，比尔！”姑娘说道，看见他回来显得很高兴。","“It is you, Bill!” said the girl, with an expression of pleasure at his return."
"“是的。”男人回答，“起来。”","“It is,” was the reply.“Get up.”"
"屋里点了一支蜡烛，但是男人迅速地把它从烛台上拔了下来，丢在了壁炉下面。看见外面微弱的晨光，姑娘起来，要拉开窗帘。","There was a candle burning, but the man hastily drew it from the candlestick, and hurled it under the grate.Seeing the faint light of early day without, the girl rose to undraw the curtain."
"“别管它。”赛克斯说着，猛地把手挡在她面前。“这光线对我接下来要做的事来说足够了。”","“Let it be,” said Sikes, thrusting his hand before her.“There’s enough light for wot I’ve got to do.”"
"“比尔，”姑娘惊慌地低声说，“你为什么那样看着我！”","“Bill,” said the girl, in the low voice of alarm, “why do you look like that at me!”"
"强盗坐在那儿，注视了她一会儿，鼻孔张大，胸口起伏，然后，抓住她的头和脖子，把她拖到屋中间，再一次往门那儿看了看，用大手捂住了她的嘴。","The robber sat regarding her, for a few seconds, with dilated nostrils and heaving breast; and then, grasping her by the head and throat, dragged her into the middle of the room, and looking once towards the door, placed his heavy hand upon her mouth."
"“比尔，比尔！”姑娘喘着气挣扎，极度的恐惧给了她力量。“我——我不会尖叫或大喊的——一下也不会——听我说——和我说话吧——告诉我，我做什么了让你这样对我！”","“Bill, Bill!” gasped the girl, wrestling with the strength of mortal fear,—“I—I won’t scream or cry—not once—hear me—speak to me—tell me what I have done!”"
"“你自己知道，你这个恶婆娘！”强盗回答，尽量让自己呼吸平稳。“你今晚被人监视了，你说的每句话都被人听见了。”","“You know, you she devil!” returned the robber, suppressing his breath.“You were watched to-night; every word you said was heard.”"
"“那看在老天爷的份上，饶我一命吧，像我饶了你一样。”姑娘贴在他身上回答，“比尔，亲爱的比尔，你无法狠心杀死我的。噢！想想就是在这一个晚上，我为你放弃的一切吧。你——应该——找时间想一想，避免自己犯下这项罪行，我不会松手的，你休想抛下我。比尔，比尔，看在亲爱的上帝的份上，为了你自己，也为了我，在让我鲜血溅出前停下吧！我对你是真心的，我以自己有罪的灵魂发誓！”","“Then spare my life for the love of Heaven, as I spared yours,” rejoined the girl, clinging to him.“Bill, dear Bill, you cannot have the heart to kill me.Oh! think of all I have given up, only this one night, for you.You—shall—have time to think, and save yourself this crime; I will not loose my hold, you cannot throw me off.Bill, Bill, for dear God’s sake, for your own, for mine, stop before you spill my blood!I have been true to you, upon my guilty soul I have!”"
"男人激烈地挣扎，想把手臂挣开，但是姑娘的胳膊紧紧抱住他，他尽全力扯她，也没法把她的胳膊掰开。","The man struggled violently, to release his arms; but those of the girl were clasped round his, and tear her as he would, he could not tear them away."
"“比尔，”姑娘叫道，努力把头靠在他胸口，“那位绅士和那位亲爱的小姐今晚告诉我，我可以在国外有个家，清净安宁地过完余生。让我再见他们一次，跪下求他们，让他们也给你同样的怜悯和仁慈，让我们双双离开这个可怕的地方，走得远远的，去过更美好的日子；除了祷告的时候以外，让我们忘掉过去的生活，永远不再见其他人。悔悟永远不会太晚的。他们这么告诉我的——我现在也这么觉得——但是我需要时间——一点点，只要一点点时间！”","“Bill,” cried the girl, striving to lay her head upon his breast, “the gentleman and that dear lady, told me to-night of a home in some foreign country where I could end my days in solitude and peace.Let me see them again, and beg them, on my knees, to show the same mercy and goodness to you; and let us both leave this dreadful place, and far apart lead better lives, and forget how we have lived, except in prayers, and never see each other more.It is never too late to repent.They told me so—I feel it now—but we must have time—a little, little time!”"
"强盗挣脱了一只胳膊，握住了手枪。即使在盛怒之下，他的脑中也闪过了一旦开枪肯定会马上败露的念头。姑娘的脸向上仰着，几乎挨到了他自己的脸，而他用尽全身力气拿枪托朝姑娘的脸猛敲了两下。","The housebreaker freed one arm, and grasped his pistol.The certainty of immediate detection if he fired, flashed across his mind even in the midst of his fury; and he beat it twice with all the force he could summon, upon the upturned face that almost touched his own."
"她摇晃着倒下了，鲜血从前额上一道很深的口子里流了下来，几乎盖住了眼睛。但她还是艰难地跪了起来，从胸口拽出了一块白手帕——罗丝·梅莱的那块——双手交叉，抓着手帕，用她微弱的力量尽量把它高高地向天举起，小声祷告着，祈求造物主的宽恕。","She staggered and fell: nearly blinded with the blood that rained down from a deep gash in her forehead; but raising herself, with difficulty, on her knees, drew from her bosom a white handkerchief—Rose Maylie’s own—and holding it up, in her folded hands, as high towards Heaven as her feeble strength would allow, breathed one prayer for mercy to her Maker."
"这个样子看起来非常可怕。凶手摇摇晃晃地退到墙边，用手挡住视线，抓住一根沉重的棒子，把她打倒在地。","It was a ghastly figure to look upon.The murderer staggering backward to the wall, and shutting out the sight with his hand, seized a heavy club and struck her down."
"第四十八章 赛克斯逃亡","CHAPTER XLVIII The flight of sikes "
"夜幕降临后，在伦敦这片广大区域里发生的恶行，是所有在黑暗遮掩下的劣迹中，最恶劣的了。早晨的空气中弥漫着恶臭的气味，在所有发生的惨事里，这一件是最邪恶、最残忍的。","Of all bad deeds that, under cover of the darkness, had been committed within wide London’s bounds since night hung over it, that was the worst.Of all the horrors that rose with an ill scent upon the morning air, that was the foulest and most cruel."
"太阳——明亮的太阳，不仅带来光明，还给人类带来了新的生命、希望以及勃勃生机——突然清晰明朗、光辉灿烂地出现在这座拥挤城市的上空。阳光公平地穿透奢华的彩色玻璃和纸糊的窗户，穿过大教堂的穹顶和腐朽的裂缝。它照亮了被谋杀的女人躺着的那个房间。赛克斯试图把阳光挡在外面，但阳光还是会照进来。如果说，这幅景象在阴暗的清晨里十分可怕的话，那么现在，在明朗的阳光下它又是怎样的呢！","The sun—the bright sun, that brings back, not light alone, but new life, and hope, and freshness to man—burst upon the crowded city in clear and radiant glory.Through costly-coloured glass and paper-mended window, through cathedral dome and rotten crevice, it shed its equal ray.It lighted up the room where the murdered woman lay.It did.He tried to shut it out, but it would stream in.If the sight had been a ghastly one in the dull morning, what was it, now, in all that brilliant light!"
"他没有动，一下都不敢动。女人曾经发出一声呻吟，手动了一下，在盛怒之下加之恐惧让他给了她一击又一击。他曾经扔了张毯子在尸体上，但是想到那双眼睛，想到它们朝自己转过来，这要比看见它们直直地往上盯着，就像在看天花板上那滩血的倒影在阳光中轻微抖动，还要糟糕。他又把毯子拽开了。于是尸体露了出来——仅仅只有血和肉，没有别的——却是这样的肉，这么多的血！","He had not moved; he had been afraid to stir.There had been a moan and motion of the hand; and, with terror added to rage, he had struck and struck again.Once he threw a rug over it; but it was worse to fancy the eyes, and imagine them moving towards him, than to see them glaring upward, as if watching the reflection of the pool of gore that quivered and danced in the sunlight on the ceiling.He had plucked it off again.And there was the body—mere flesh and blood, no more—but such flesh, and so much blood!"
"他擦燃了一根火柴，点燃炉火，把木棒塞了进去。木棒末端的毛发燃烧着萎缩成一点灰烬，被风带起，打着转飞进了烟囱。即使是这样，他也感到害怕，尽管他以前十分强壮；他抓着那件凶器，直到它破裂开来，然后把它放在煤堆上，让它烧尽，接着燃成了灰。他把自己清洗了一番，并擦了擦衣服，衣服上有些污点无法去掉，他就把这几片剪下来烧了。这些污迹怎么会弄得满屋都是！连狗的爪子上都是血。","He struck a light, kindled a fire, and thrust the club into it.There was hair upon the end, which blazed and shrunk into a light cinder, and, caught by the air, whirled up the chimney.Even that frightened him, sturdy as he was; but he held the weapon till it broke, and then piled it on the coals to burn away, and smoulder into ashes.He washed himself, and rubbed his clothes; there were spots that would not be removed, but he cut the pieces out, and burnt them.How those stains were dispersed about the room!The very feet of the dog were bloody."
"在这整段时间里，他背对着尸体，一次也没有转过身去，是的，一刻也没有。做完了这些准备之后，他朝门退去，还牵着狗，以防它把爪子再弄脏，把这项罪行的新证据带到大街上。他轻轻地关门落锁，拿了钥匙，离开了房子。","All this time he had, never once, turned his back upon the corpse; no, not for a moment.Such preparations completed, he moved, backward, towards the door: dragging the dog with him, lest he should soil his feet anew and carry out new evidence of the crime into the streets.He shut the door softly, locked it, took the key, and left the house."
"他穿到马路对面，向上朝窗户看了一眼，确定从外面什么也看不见。窗帘仍然低垂着，她本想打开它，让阳光照进去，但她再也见不到光亮了。尸体几乎就躺在那下面。——他——知道的。上帝，阳光怎么偏偏倾洒在那个地方！","He crossed over, and glanced up at the window, to be sure that nothing was visible from the outside.There was the curtain still drawn, which she would have opened to admit the light she never saw again.It lay nearly under there.—He—knew that.God, how the sun poured down upon the very spot!"
"那一眼只是一瞬间的事。它是对摆脱了那间屋子的一个安慰。他对狗吹着口哨，快速地走开了。","The glance was instantaneous.It was a relief to have got free of the room.He whistled on the dog, and walked rapidly away."
"他穿过伊斯灵顿，大步越过在海格特旁边、矗立着惠廷顿纪念碑的小山坡，转向海格特山。他没有确定的目标，不知道该到哪儿去，几乎刚开始下山，他就再次往右边穿过去，走上穿过田野的小径，沿着凯恩森林的边缘，来到了汉普斯特德荒地。横穿过希斯谷旁边的小山谷，他爬上对面的山坡，又穿过了连接汉普斯特德和海格特两处村子的大路，沿着余下的那段荒地来到了北郊的田野，他在一块地的树篱下面躺了下来，睡着了。","He went through Islington; strode up the hill at Highgate on which stands the stone in honour of Whittington; turned down to Highgate Hill, unsteady of purpose, and uncertain where to go; struck off to the right again, almost as soon as he began to descend it; and taking the foot-path across the fields, skirted Caen Wood, and so came on Hampstead Heath.Traversing the hollow by the Vale of Heath, he mounted the opposite bank, and crossing the road which joins the villages of Hampstead and Highgate, made along the remaining portion of the heath to the fields at North End, in one of which he laid himself down under a hedge, and slept."
"很快他又爬起来赶路——不是深入村庄，而是沿着大路朝伦敦方向返回——然后又倒回来——接着从另一侧越过他已经穿行了的同一片地——然后在田野里四处游荡，在水渠边休息，又突然跃起换一个地点，做同样的事情，然后再次闲逛。","Soon he was up again, and away,—not far into the country, but back towards London by the high-road—then back again—then over another part of the same ground as he already traversed—then wandering up and down in fields, and lying on ditches’ brinks to rest, and starting up to make for some other spot, and do the same, and ramble on again."
"他能去附近哪个人不太多的地方弄些吃的和喝的呢？亨登。那是个好地方，不算太远，并且很少有人路过。他决定往那儿走——一会儿奔跑，一会儿又出于一种怪癖，以蜗牛那样的速度游荡，或是完全停下来，无所事事地用木棍毁坏树篱。但是当他到达那地方的时候，他遇见的所有人——甚至是门边的孩子们——似乎都用怀疑的眼神看他。他再次转身，没有勇气买一点儿吃的，或是一滴喝的，尽管他已经很多个钟头没有吃过东西了，他再一次徘徊在荒地上，不知道要去哪里。","Where could he go, that was near and not too public, to get some meat and drink?Hendon.That was a good place, not far off, and out of most people’s way.Thither he directed his steps,—running sometimes, and sometimes, with a strange perversity, loitering at a snail’s pace, or stopping altogether and idly breaking the hedges with a stick.But when he got there, all the people he met—the very children at the doors—seemed to view him with suspicion.Back he turned again, without the courage to purchase bit or drop, though he had tasted no food for many hours; and once more he lingered on the Heath, uncertain where to go."
"他徘徊了很多里路，还是回到了老地方。早晨和中午过去了，白天就要结束了。他仍在来回游荡，上上下下，兜了一圈又一圈，还是在同一个地方逗留。最后他离开了，动身前往哈特菲尔德。","He wandered over miles and miles of ground, and still came back to the old place.Morning and noon had passed, and the day was on the wane, and still he rambled to and fro, and up and down, and round and round, and still lingered about the same spot.At last he got away, and shaped his course for Hatfield."
"这时已是晚上九点，这个男人相当精疲力尽，连狗也因为这不寻常的运动变得一瘸一拐的。村子很安静，他们从教堂旁边的小山坡走下来，沿着小街，步伐沉重地缓步走着；他们悄悄走进了一家小酒馆，那里昏暗的光线把他们引了过去。酒吧间里生了炉火，几个农民正在炉火前喝酒。","It was nine o’clock at night, when the man, quite tired out, and the dog, limping and lame from the unaccustomed exercise, turned down the hill by the church of the quiet village, and plodding along the little street, crept into a small public-house, whose scanty light had guided them to the spot.There was a fire in the tap-room, and some country-labourers were drinking before it."
"他们给陌生人让出了一块地方，但他却在最远的角落坐了下来，独自吃喝，或者说是跟他的狗一起吃喝，他不时给狗扔一些食物。","They made room for the stranger, but he sat down in the furthest corner, and ate and drank alone, or rather with his dog: to whom he cast a morsel of food from time to time."
"聚在这儿的男人们，聊起了附近的土地和农民，当那些话题没什么可说的之后，又谈起了上周日下葬的某位老人的年龄。在场的年轻人认为他很老了，而老年人则宣称他还相当年轻——一个满头白发的老爷子说，他没有自己年纪大——他至少还能再活十到十五年，如果他注意保养了的话，如果他注意保养了。","The conversation of the men assembled here, turned upon the neighbouring land, and farmers; and when those topics were exhausted, upon the age of some old man who had been buried on the previous Sunday;the young men present considering him very old, and the old men present declaring him to have been quite young—not older, one white-haired grandfather said, than he was—with ten or fifteen year of life in him at least—if he had taken care; if he had taken care."
"这谈话里没什么能引起注意或激起恐慌的东西。强盗付完账单之后，静静地坐在角落里，无人注意，然后他几乎要睡着了，这时他被一个新来的客人进门的吵闹声弄得清醒了一半。","There was nothing to attract attention, or excite alarm in this.The robber, after paying his reckoning, sat silent and unnoticed in his corner, and had almost dropped asleep, when he was half wakened by the noisy entrance of a new comer."
"这是个哗众取宠的小贩兼江湖骗子，他在乡间徒步旅行，兜售磨刀石、皮带、剃刀、洗衣球、马具浆糊、医治狗和马的药、廉价香水、化妆品，以及类似的货物，他把这些都装在背上的一个箱子里。他一进来，就跟乡下人讲起各种各样的家常笑话，直到他吃完晚饭，才缓了下来。他打开自己的宝贝箱子，非常巧妙地设法把生意和娱乐结合了起来。","This was an antic fellow, half pedlar and half mountebank, who travelled about the country on foot to vend hones, strops, razors, washballs, harness-paste, medicine for dogs and horses, cheap perfumery, cosmetics, and such-like wares, which he carried in a case slung to his back.His entrance was the signal for various homely jokes with the countrymen, which slackened not until he had made his supper, and opened his box of treasures, when he ingeniously contrived to unite business with amusement."
"“那是什么东西？好吃吗，哈里？”一个咧着嘴笑的乡下人，指着角落里一些形状像蛋糕的东西问道。","“And what be that stoof?Good to eat, Harry?” asked a grinning countryman, pointing to some composition-cakes in one corner."
"“这个，”那家伙拿起一个说，“这个是绝对可靠的无价合成物，可以去除丝绸、缎子、亚麻、棉布、衣料、填料、地毯、绉纱、呢绒、平纹细布、斜纹布，或是羊毛纺织品上的各种各样的染色、锈斑、泥土、霉菌、斑点、污点，或泼溅的印迹。不论是葡萄酒渍、水果渍、啤酒渍、水渍、涂料渍,还是沥青渍，任何污渍，只要用绝对可靠的无价混合物擦一下，就能全部除去。如果哪位女士名誉被玷污，她只需要吞下一块这种蛋糕，就能药到病除——因为它是一种毒药。如果哪位绅士想要证明这一点，他只需要咽下一小块，就会确信无疑了——因为它像手枪子弹一样令人满意，并且在味道上要更让人厌恶得多，因此拿它更加可靠。一便士一小块。它有这么多好处，一小块只要一便士！”","“This,” said the fellow, producing one, “this is the infallible and invaluable composition for removing all sorts of stain, rust, dirt, mildew, spick, speck, spot, or spatter, from silk, satin, linen, cambric, cloth, crape, stuff, carpet, merino, muslin, bombazeen, or woollen stuff.Wine-stains, fruit-stains, beer-stains, water-stains, paint-stains, pitch-stains, any stains, all come out at one rub with the infallible and invaluable composition.If a lady stains her honour, she has only need to swallow one cake and she’s cured at once—for it’s  poison.If a gentleman wants to prove this, he has only need to bolt one little square, and he has put it beyond question—for it’s quite as satisfactory as a pistol-bullet, and a great deal nastier in the flavour, consequently the more credit in taking it.One penny a square.With all these virtues, one penny a square!”"
"立刻就有两个人买了，更多的听众明显在犹豫。小贩注意到这一点，叫卖得更起劲了。","There were two buyers directly, and more of the listeners plainly hesitated.The vendor observing this, increased in loquacity."
"“它一问世，就立刻被抢购一空啦。”那家伙说，“现在有十四座水磨，六座蒸汽机，还有一个原电池在不停地生产它。还是生产得不够快，尽管工人们拼命工作，累得丢了性命，寡妇们马上得了抚恤金，一个孩子一年二十镑，双胞胎补贴五十镑。一小块只要一便士！半便士的来两个也一样，四分之一便士的收四个我也很乐意。一小块只要一便士！葡萄酒渍、水果渍、啤酒渍、水渍、涂料渍、沥青渍、泥渍、血渍！这是在座的一位绅士帽子上的一个污点，他还没来得及请我喝一品脱啤酒，我就会把这污点弄干净。”","“It’s all bought up as fast as it can be made,” said the fellow.“There are fourteen water-mills, six steam-engines, and a galvanic battery, always a-working upon it, and they can’t make it fast enough, though the men work so hard that they die off, and the widows is pensioned directly, with twenty pound a-year for each of the children, and a premium of fifty for twins.One penny a square!Two half-pence is all the same, and four farthings is received with joy.One penny a square!Wine-stains, fruit-stains, beer-stains, water-stains, paint-stains, pitch-stains, mud-stains, blood-stains!Here is a stain upon the hat of a gentleman in company, that I’ll take clean out, before he can order me a pint of ale.”"
"“嘿！”赛克斯猛地站起来叫道，“把它还给我。”","“Hah!” cried Sikes starting up.“Give that back.”"
"“我会把它弄干净的，先生，”那人朝在座的人眨眨眼，回答道，“在您穿过房间拿到它之前。先生们，都注意看这位绅士帽子上的这个深色污点，不比一个先令大，却比一个半克朗的硬币还要厚。不论它是葡萄酒渍、水果渍、啤酒渍、水渍、涂料渍、沥青渍、泥渍还是血——渍——”这人没能继续说下去，因为赛克斯发出一声可怕的咒骂，推翻了桌子，从他那儿扯回帽子，冲出了酒馆。","“I’ll take it clean out, sir,” replied the man, winking to the company, “before you can come across the room to get it.Gentlemen all, observe the dark stain upon this gentleman’s hat, no wider than a shilling, but thicker than a half-crown.Whether it is a wine-stain, fruit-stain, beer-stain, water-stain, paint-stain, pitch-stain, mud-stain, or blood-stain—” The man got no further, for Sikes with a hideous imprecation overthrew the table, and tearing the hat from him, burst out of the house."
"同样的反常情绪和犹豫不定牢牢控制着这个凶手，折磨了他整整一天，他发现自己没有被跟踪，并且他们很可能以为自己只是某个闷闷不乐的醉汉，就回头向镇上走去。一辆公共马车停在路边，他避开马车的灯光，从旁边经过时，认出了这是从伦敦来的驿车，看见它停在小邮局的前面。他差不多知道接下来要发生什么，但还是穿过马路，留神听着。","With the same perversity of feeling and irresolution that had fastened upon him, despite himself, all day, the murderer, finding that he was not followed, and that they most probably considered him some drunken sullen fellow, turned back up the town,and getting out of the glare of the lamps of a stage-coach that was standing in the street, was walking past, when he recognised the mail from London, and saw that it was standing at the little post-office.He almost knew what was to come; but he crossed over, and listened."
"驿车押运员站在门边，等着邮包。这时，一个穿得像猎场看守人的男人出现了，押运员交给他一个已经放在人行道上的篮子。","The guard was standing at the door, waiting for the letter-bag.A man, dressed like a game-keeper, came up at the moment, and he handed him a basket which lay ready on the pavement."
"“这是给你的人的。”押运员说，“喂，里面的人快点儿行不行。那该死的邮包，前天晚上都还没弄好，这样不行，你知道的！”","“That’s for your people,” said the guard.“Now, look alive in there, will you.Damn that’ere bag, it warn’t ready night afore last; this won’t do, you know!”"
"“城里有什么新鲜事吗，本？”猎场看守人为了更好地欣赏那几匹马，向百叶窗退去。","“Anything new up in town, Ben?” asked the game-keeper, drawing back to the window-shutters, the better to admire the horses."
"“不，据我所知没有。”男人回答着，戴上手套。“小麦价格涨了一点儿。我还听说了斯皮达菲那里的一起凶杀案，但是我不太相信。”","“No, nothing that I knows on,” replied the man, pulling on his gloves.“Corn’s up a little.I heerd talk of a murder, too, down Spitalfields way, but I don’t reckon much upon it.”"
"“噢，确实是真的。”马车里面的一位绅士一面从窗户向外看，一面说道，“而且是一起可怕的凶杀案。”","“Oh, that’s quite true,” said a gentleman inside, who was looking out of the window.“And a dreadful murder it was.”"
"“是吗，先生？”押运员碰了碰帽子，又说，“是男人还是女人，劳驾，先生？”","“Was it, sir?”rejoined the guard, touching his hat.“Man or woman, pray, sir?”"
"“一个女人。”绅士回答，“根据猜测——”“喂，本。”马车夫不耐烦地喊道。","“A woman,” replied the gentleman.“It is supposed—” “Now, Ben,” replied the coachman impatiently."
"“那该死的邮包，”押运员说，“里面的人睡着了吗？”","“Damn that’ere bag,” said the guard; “are you gone to sleep in there?”"
"“来啦！”邮局管理员跑出来叫道。","“Coming!” cried the office keeper, running out."
"“来啦。”押运员咆哮着说，“啊，将要爱上我的那位有钱小姐也会来的，但是我不知道什么时候才会来。好啦，抓好了。好——咧！”","“Coming,” growled the guard.“Ah, and so’s the young ’ooman of property that’s going to take a fancy to me, but I don’t know when.Here, give hold.All ri—ight!”"
"喇叭发出几个欢快的音符，马车离开了。","The horn sounded a few cheerful notes, and the coach was gone."
"赛克斯仍然站在街上，显然对刚听到的那些无动于衷，他除了疑惑要到哪儿去，没有更强烈的焦虑了。最终他又走了回去，走上从哈特菲尔德通向圣奥尔本斯的大路。","Sikes remained standing in the street, apparently unmoved by what he had just heard, and agitated by no stronger feeling than a doubt where to go.At length he went back again, and took the road which leads from Hatfield to St. Albans."
"他固执地往前走，但当他把小镇抛在身后，投入大路上的孤独黑暗里的时候，他感到一丝恐惧和畏怯在身上蔓延，彻底动摇了他。他面前的所有物体，实物或影子，静态的或动态的，都很像某种可怕的东西，但这些恐惧都比不上萦绕在他周围的那种感觉，他感到那天早晨的可怕身影一直跟在他身后。他能在一片幽暗中发现它的影子，说出它轮廓最细小的特征，记下它一路走来的样子是多么僵硬阴森。他能听见它的衣服在树叶间沙沙作响，以及每阵风都带来的那最后一声低低的叫喊。如果他停下，它也停下。如果他跑起来，它就跟着——并非也在跑，要是它也跑，那也算是一种安慰，但是它像一具仅仅被赋予了生命机能的尸体，被一阵缓慢忧郁、既不上升也不下沉的风往前推动。","He went on doggedly; but as he left the town behind him, and plunged into the solitude and darkness of the road, he felt a dread and awe creeping upon him which shook him to the core.Every object before him, substance or shadow, still or moving, took the semblance of some fearful thing; but these fears were nothing compared to the sense that haunted him of that morning’s ghastly figure following at his heels.He could trace its shadow in the gloom, supply the smallest item of the outline, and note how stiff and solemn it seemed to stalk along.He could hear its garments rustling in the leaves, and every breath of wind came laden with that last low cry.If he stopped it did the same.If he ran, it followed—not running too: that would have been a relief: but like a corpse endowed with the mere machinery of life, and borne on one slow melancholy wind that never rose or fell."
"有时，他带着不顾一切的决心转过身来，决定赶跑这个幻影，尽管它会死死看着他。但是他头发都竖了起来，血液也凝固了，因为它也随他转过身来，就在他身后。那天早晨的事一直在他面前，但是现在它在他的身后了——一直在。他背靠着一个土堆，感到它站在他上面，在寒冷的夜空中清晰可见。他躺倒在大路上——背贴着路面。它则笔直地、静静地立在他头顶，一动不动——一块活墓碑，碑文由鲜血撰写。","At times, he turned, with desperate determination, resolved to beat this phantom off, though it should look him dead; but the hair rose on his head, and his blood stood still, for it had turned with him and was behind him then.He had kept it before him that morning, but it was behind now—always.He leaned his back against a bank, and felt that it stood above him, visibly out against the cold night-sky.He threw himself upon the road—on his back upon the road.At his head it stood, silent, erect, and still—a living grave-stone, with its epitaph in blood."
"谁都别说凶手可以逍遥法外，并且暗示上帝一定睡着了。在恐惧带来的极度痛苦中，度过漫长的一分钟，就相当于惨死二十回。","Let no man talk of murderers escaping justice, and hint that Providence must sleep.There were twenty score of violent deaths in one long minute of that agony of fear."
"他经过的一片田地里有个小屋子，这为他提供了一个过夜的栖身之处。屋门前是三棵高高的白杨树，这使屋里非常暗，风带着凄凉的哀号从树间呜咽而过。他——不能——继续走了，直到再次天亮，在这里他紧靠着墙，伸展肢体——来忍受新的折磨。","There was a shed in a field he passed, that offered shelter for the night.Before the door, were three tall poplar trees, which made it very dark within; and the wind moaned through them with a dismal wail.He—could not—walk on, till daylight came again; and here he stretched himself close to the wall—to undergo new torture."
"现在，一个幻影来到他面前，和他逃避的那个一样顽固，并且更加可怕。那些睁得大大的眼睛出现在黑暗之中，如此黯淡无神，让他宁肯忍受看着它们，也不愿想象它们，它们自己会发光，却无法照亮任何东西。仅仅只有两只眼睛，但它们却无处不在。如果他闭上眼睛，脑海中就会出现那个每样物品他都熟知的房间——事实上，如果他按记忆浏览一遍房中物品的话，有些他应该已经忘了——每样东西都在它通常的位置上。尸体也在——它的——位置上，那眼睛就像他溜走时看见的一样。他爬起来，冲进了外面的田地。那身影跟在他后面。他又回到小屋，再一次蜷缩起来。那双眼睛在他躺下之前就出现在那里。","For now, a vision came before him, as constant and more terrible than that from which he had escaped.Those widely staring eyes, so lustreless and so glassy, that he had better borne to see them than think upon them, appeared in the midst of the darkness: light in themselves, but giving light to nothing.There were but two, but they were everywhere.If he shut out the sight, there came the room with every well-known object—some, indeed, that he would have forgotten, if he had gone over its contents from memory—each in its accustomed place.The body was in—its—place, and its eyes were as he saw them when he stole away.He got up, and rushed into the field without.The figure was behind him.He re-entered the shed, and shrunk down once more.The eyes were there, before he had laid himself along."
"此时，他继续留在这种只有他自己才知道的恐惧中，四肢发抖，浑身所有的毛孔都直冒冷汗。突然，夜风中传来远处叫嚷呼喊的喧闹声音，里面掺杂着恐慌和惊愕。在那种偏僻的地方，任何人声，即使它传达的真的是恐慌的到来，对他而言也意义非凡。想到关系到个人安危，他重新获得了力量和精神，一下子跳了起来，冲到了外面的田地里。","And here he remained in such terror as none but he can know, trembling in every limb, and the cold sweat starting from every pore, when suddenly there arose upon the night-wind the noise of distant shouting, and the roar of voices mingled in alarm and wonder.Any sound of men in that lonely place, even though it conveyed a real cause of alarm, was something to him.He regained his strength and energy at the prospect of personal danger; and springing to his feet, rushed into the open air."
"广阔的天空似乎都着了火。片片火焰带着倾泻四溅的火星冲上天，翻卷着一片高过一片，照亮了周围几里的天空，朝他站着的方向推来一团团浓烟。叫嚷声变得更大了，因为新的声音加入了呼喊的行列，他能听见“着火了！”的大叫，与警钟的鸣响、沉重的物体倒下的声音，以及火焰发出的噼啪声混杂在一起，火焰缠绕住某个障碍物，火舌朝天空窜起，就像得到了食物的补充。他看着看着，喧闹声更大了。那里有人——有男人，也有女人——火光明亮，闹哄哄的，一片忙乱。这对他来说，就像新的生命一样。他往前狂奔起来——直直地一头向前冲——冲过荆棘和灌木丛，越过大门和篱笆，像他那只一边在他前面猛冲，一边大声吠叫的狗一样疯狂。","The broad sky seemed on fire.Rising into the air with showers of sparks, and rolling one above the other, were sheets of flame, lighting the atmosphere for miles round, and driving clouds of smoke in the direction where he stood.The shouts grew louder as new voices swelled the roar, and he could hear the cry of Fire! mingled with the ringing of an alarm-bell, the fall of heavy bodies, and the cracking of flames as they twined round some obstacle, and shot aloft as though refreshed by food.The noise increased as he looked.There were people there—men and women—light, bustle.It was like new life to him.He darted onward—straight, headlong—dashing through brier and brake, and leaping gate and fence as madly as his dog, who careered with loud and sounding bark before him."
"他来到了现场。很多衣衫不整的身影在来回奔跑，一些人试图把受惊的马从马厩拉出来，另一些则把牛从院子和牛棚里赶出来，还有一些在飞溅的火星中以及将要坍塌的、炽热的横梁下，从火堆里往外搬东西。一个小时之前本是门和窗的地方，现在变成喷出熊熊烈火的缝隙，墙壁在燃烧的火井中摇晃崩塌，铅和铁融化成白色的滚烫液体，倾泻到地上。女人和孩子尖叫着，男人们用吵闹的呼喊和吆喝互相鼓劲。消防水泵的铿然之声，水落在燃烧的木头上发出的哗哗声和嘶嘶声，汇聚到巨大的轰鸣声中。赛克斯也高声呼喊起来，直到嗓子都哑了，他摆脱了记忆，也摆脱了自己，跳进了最密集的人群。这天晚上他冲来冲去，一会儿开动水泵，一会儿又急忙穿过烟火，一刻不停地让自己在喧闹声和人群最密集的地方忙碌。他上上下下地爬梯子、上房顶，穿过几乎撑不住他的体重而摇摇晃晃的楼层，冒着掉落的砖头和石块，出现在大火燃烧的每一个地方；但他如有神助，既没有被擦伤，也没有被碰伤，一点儿都不疲惫，脑中空空如也，直到再次破晓，四周只剩下烟雾和焦黑的废墟。","He came upon the spot.There were half-dressed figures tearing to and fro, some endeavouring to drag the frightened horses from the stables, others driving the cattle from the yard and out-houses, and others coming laden from the burning pile, amidst a shower of falling sparks, and the tumbling down of red-hot beams.The apertures, where doors and windows stood an hour ago, disclosed a mass of raging fire; walls rocked and crumbled into the burning well; the molten lead and iron poured down, white hot, upon the ground.Women and children shrieked, and men encouraged each other with noisy shouts and cheers.The clanking of the engine-pumps, and the spirting and hissing of the water as it fell upon the blazing wood, added to the tremendous roar.He shouted, too, till he was hoarse; and flying from memory and himself, plunged into the thickest of the throng.Hither and thither he dived that night: now working at the pumps, and now hurrying through the smoke and flame, but never ceasing to engage himself wherever noise and men were thickest. Up and down the ladders, upon the roofs of buildings, over floors that quaked and trembled with his weight, under the lee of falling bricks and stones, in every part of that great fire was he; but he bore a charmed life, and had neither scratch nor bruise, nor weariness nor thought, till morning dawned again, and only smoke and blackened ruins remained."
"这疯狂的兴奋劲儿过去之后，那关于他犯下罪行的可怕意识带着十倍的威力回来了。他疑心很重地环顾四周，人们在成群地交谈，他害怕自己成为他们谈话的主题。他意味深长地动了动手指，狗听他使唤，他们一起悄悄离开了。他经过一个水泵近旁时，坐在那儿的几个人招呼他一起吃些东西。他吃了点儿面包和肉，刚喝了一口啤酒，就听见伦敦来的消防员们在谈论那起凶杀案。“他们说他去了伯明翰，”一个人说，“但他们还是会抓住他的，因为侦探们已经出发了，明天晚上之前通缉令就会遍布全国。”","This mad excitement over, there returned, with ten-fold force, the dreadful consciousness of his crime.He looked suspiciously about him, for the men were conversing in groups, and he feared to be the subject of their talk.The dog obeyed the significant beck of his finger, and they drew off, stealthily, together.He passed near an engine where some men were seated, and they called to him to share in their refreshment.He took some bread and meat; and as he drank a draught of beer, heard the firemen, who were from London, talking about the murder.“He has gone to Birmingham, they say,” said one: “but they’ll have him yet, for the scouts are out, and by to-morrow night there’ll be a cry all through the country.”"
"他急忙离开了，一直走到几乎倒在地上。然后他在一条小路上躺下，睡了一觉，这一觉时间很长，却断断续续，并不安稳。他再次徘徊起来，踌躇不定，并且感到恐惧的压迫，他害怕又是一个孤独的夜晚。","He hurried off, and walked till he almost dropped upon the ground; then lay down in a lane, and had a long, but broken and uneasy sleep.He wandered on again, irresolute and undecided, and oppressed with the fear of another solitary night."
"突然，他孤注一掷，决定回到伦敦去。","Suddenly, he took the desperate resolution to going back to London."
"“无论如何，在那里可以和人说说话。”他想，“也是个藏身的好地方。我在乡下留下这处踪迹后，他们绝对想不到在那儿逮我。我为什么不歇上一个星期左右，然后硬逼费金给我一笔钱，到法国去呢？该死，我来冒这个险。”","“There’s somebody to speak to there, at all event,” he thought.“A good hiding-place, too.They’ll never expect to nab me there, after this country scent.Why can’t I lie by for a week or so, and, forcing blunt from Fagin, get abroad to France?Damme, I’ll risk it.”"
"他立刻把这阵心血来潮付诸于行动，挑选了人们最不常走的道路，开始了他回程的旅途；他下定决心要在距首都不远处栖身藏匿，然后采取一条迂回的路线在黄昏进入伦敦，接着直接奔向城中他事先选定的目的地。","He acted upon this impulse without delay, and choosing the least frequented roads began his journey back, resolved to lie concealed within a short distance of the metropolis, and, entering it at dusk by a circuitous route, to proceed straight to that part of it which he had fixed on for his destination."
"可是还有狗。如果有任何对他的描述已经发出去了，那么有一点不会被忘记，那就是狗也不见了，并且很可能跟他在一起。这可能导致他在沿街行走的时候被捕。他决定淹死这条狗，于是继续往前走，四下张望，寻找池塘；他捡起一块很重的石头，一边走一边把它拴在手帕上。","The dog, though.If any description of him were out, it would not be forgotten that the dog was missing, and had probably gone with him.This might lead to his apprehension as he passed along the streets.He resolved to drown him, and walked on, looking about for a pond: picking up a heavy stone and tying it to his handkerchief as he went."
"他做这些准备的时候，那只狗抬起头来，看着主人的脸。不知是它的本能察觉到某些目的，还是强盗侧眼看它的样子比平常还要严厉，它偷偷摸摸地走在后面，比平常落得更远一点，并且越走越慢，畏畏缩缩的。当它的主人停在池塘边，环顾四下叫它的时候，它彻底停了下来。","The animal looked up into his master’s face while these preparations were making; whether his instinct apprehended something of their purpose, or the robber’s sidelong look at him was sterner than ordinary, he skulked a little farther in the rear than usual, and cowered as he came more slowly along.When his master halted at the brink of a pool, and looked round to call him, he stopped outright."
"“你听见我叫你了没？过来！”赛克斯叫道。","“Do you hear me call?Come here!” cried Sikes."
"那狗受习惯驱使走上前来，但是当赛克斯弯腰把手帕绑在它脖子上时，它发出一声低低的咆哮，向后退去。","The animal came up from the very force of habit; but as Sikes stooped to attach the handkerchief to his throat, he uttered a low growl and started back."
"“回来！”强盗说。","“Come back!” said the robber."
"狗摇了摇尾巴，但是没有动。赛克斯做了个活套，再一次叫它过来。","The dog wagged his tail, but moved not.Sikes made a running noose and called him again."
"狗向前挪动，又向后退去，停了一下，然后以最快的速度跑了。","The dog advanced, retreated, paused an instant, and scoured away at his hardest speed."
"男人一遍遍地吹着口哨，坐下来等着，希望它会回来。但是狗没再出现，最终，他重返旅途。","The man whistled again and again, and sat down and waited in the expectation that he would return.But no dog appeared, and at length he resumed his journey."
"第四十九章 蒙克斯和布朗洛先生终于见面，他们的谈话以及打断此次谈话的一则消息","CHAPTER XLIX Monks and Mr. Brownlow at length meet. Their conversation, and the intelligence that interrupts it   "
"暮色开始降临，布朗洛先生此时刚从一辆出租马车上下来。他走到自己家门前，轻轻敲了敲门。门开了。与此同时，一个健壮的男人出了马车，站到了车踏板的一侧；另一个原本坐在车座上的男人也下了车，站到了车踏板的另一侧。布朗洛先生打了个手势，那两人扶着第三个人出了马车。他们把他夹在中间，急匆匆地进了房子。这个人就是蒙克斯。","The twilight was beginning to close in, when Mr. Brownlow alighted from a hackney-coach at his own door, and knocked softly.The door being opened, a sturdy man got out of the coach and stationed himself on one side of the steps, while another man, who had been seated on the box, dismounted too, and stood upon the other side.At a sign from Mr. Brownlow, they helped out a third man, and taking him between them, hurried him into the house.This man was Monks."
"三个人就这样默默上了楼。布朗洛先生走在前面，把他们领进了一个位置靠里的房间。上楼的时候，蒙克斯就表现得很不情愿，等到了房门前，他干脆停下不走了。那两个男人看着老绅士，像是在等待指示。","They walked in the same manner up the stairs without speaking, and Mr. Brownlow, preceding them, led the way into a back-room.At the door of this apartment, Monks, who had ascended with evident reluctance, stopped.The two men looked at the old gentleman as if for instructions."
"“他知道自己有几条路可以选。”布朗洛先生说，“如果他犹豫了，或是不按你们的吩咐，做出什么小动作来，就把他拖到大街上去，叫警察来帮忙，并以我的名义检举他，控告他是个重罪犯。”","“He knows the alternative,” said Mr. Browlow.“If he hesitates or moves a finger but as you bid him, drag him into the street, call for the aid of the police, and impeach him as a felon in my name.”"
"“你怎么敢这样说我？”蒙克斯问道。","“How dare you say this of me?” asked Monks."
"“你怎么敢逼我这样说，年轻人？”布朗洛先生目不转睛地与他对视，回答道，“你已经愚蠢到要离开这所房子了吗？松开他。好啦，先生。你可以走了，这是你的自由；我们也会跟着你，这是我们的自由。但我警告你，以我心中最神圣、最庄严的一切警告你，你一旦踏出这所房子，会立刻因诈骗和抢劫罪被捕。我已打定主意，决不动摇。如果你还是要一意孤行，那么你的罪必归到你自己的头上！”","“How dare you urge me to it, young man?” replied Mr. Brownlow, confronting him with a steady look.“Are you mad enough to leave this house?Unhand him.There, sir.You are free to go, and we to follow.But I warn you, by all I hold most solemn and most sacred, that instant will have you apprehended on a charge of fraud and robbery.I am resolute and immoveable.If you are determined to be the same, your blood be upon your own head!”"
"“这些走狗在大街上绑架我，还把我带到这儿来，又是谁的授意？”蒙克斯一边问，一边依次打量着站在他身边的两个男人。","“By what authority am I kidnapped in the street, and brought here by these dogs?” asked Monks, looking from one to the other of the men who stood beside him."
"“是我。”布朗洛先生答道,“这些人是受我庇护的。如果你是在抱怨自由被剥夺了的话——在来的路上，你就有权利也有机会重获自由，但当时你却认为保持沉默比较明智——我再说一遍，你可以把自己置于法律的保护之下。我也会诉诸法律。但是当你走得太远、无法回头时，别来求我对你宽大处理，那时权利已经转到了别人手上；也别说是我把你推进深渊的，推你进深渊的恰恰是你自己。”","“By mine,” replied Mr. Brownlow.“Those persons are indemnified by me.If you complain of being deprived of your liberty—you had power and opportunity to retrieve it as you came along, but you deemed it advisable to remain quiet—I say again, throw yourself for protection on the law.I will appeal to the law too; but when you have gone too far to recede, do not sue to me for leniency, when the power will have passed into other hands; and do not say I plunged you down the gulf into which you rushed, yourself.”"
"很显然，蒙克斯此时已是心神不宁，甚至还有些惊慌失措。他犹豫了。","Monks was plainly disconcerted, and alarmed besides.He hesitated."
"“你快点决定好。”布朗洛先生说，语气坚定、气势沉稳，“如果你希望我公开提出指控，并且把你移交法办的话，那我对你的量刑无能为力；尽管我能预见到你将会受到什么程度的处罚，尽管一想到那种处罚我也会浑身哆嗦。我再说一遍，这条路你也知道地很清楚。如果你也不希望如此，你求我宽恕你，求那些曾被你深深伤害过的人对你宽大处理，那就一个字也别说，坐到那把椅子上去吧。这把椅子已经等了你整整两天了。","“You will decide quickly,” said Mr. Brownlow, with perfect firmness and composure.“If you wish me to prefer my charges publicly, and consign you to a punishment the extent of which, although I can, with a shudder, foresee, I cannot control, once more, I say, for you know the way.If not, and you appeal to my forbearance, and the mercy of those you have deeply injured, seat yourself, without a word, in that chair.It has waited for you two whole days.”"
"蒙克斯咕哝了几句，但谁也没听明白他说了什么。他还是站在那里，犹豫不前。","Monks muttered some unintelligible words, but wavered still."
"“你快点。”布朗洛先生说，“只要我一句话，你就再也没有选择的余地了。”","“You will be prompt,” said Mr. Brownlow.“A word from me, and the alternative has gone for ever.”"
"那个男人还是摇摆不定。","Still the man hesitated."
"“我没有谈判的爱好，”布朗洛先生说，“也没有谈判的权利，因为我是在维护其他人的切身利益。”","“I have not the inclination to parley,” said Mr. Brownlow, “and, as I advocate the dearest interests of others, I have not the right.”"
"“那就——”蒙克斯结结巴巴地问，“那就——没有什么折中的办法了吗？”","“Is there—” demanded Monks with a faltering tongue,—“is there—no middle course?”"
"“没有。”","“None.”"
"蒙克斯看着老绅士，目光中满是渴望，但是从老绅士脸上，他只能读出严厉和决心。他只得走进房间，耸了耸肩坐了下来。","Monks looked at the old gentleman, with an anxious eye; but, reading in his countenance nothing but severity and determination, walked into the room, and, shrugging his shoulders, sat down."
"“从外面把门锁上，”布朗洛先生对随从们说道，“等我摇铃再进来。”","“Lock the door on the outside,” said Mr. Brownlow to the attendants, “and come when I ring.”"
"两个男人听命离开，留下这二人独处。","The men obeyed, and the two were left alone together."
"“这可真是不错的待遇，先生，”蒙克斯把帽子和斗篷朝地上一扔，说道，“我父亲多年的挚友就是这样对待我的。”","“This is pretty treatment, sir,” said Monks, throwing down his hat and cloak, “from my father’s oldest friend.”"
"“正是因为我是你父亲多年的挚友，年轻人，”布朗洛先生回答，“正是因为在我年轻快乐的时光里，所有希望和心愿都是与他联系在一起的，都是与和他有血缘同胞关系的那个美丽人儿联系在一起的——她年纪轻轻就重返上帝怀抱，留下我一人孤单寂寞——正是因为在他唯一的姐姐临终时，他和我一起跪在她的床前，那时他还只是个孩子；那个早上，她本来——但是上帝有了别的旨意——该成为我年轻的妻子。正是因为我这颗饱受痛苦煎熬的心从那时起就向着他，陪着他经受种种考验，看着他犯下一个个错误，直到他离开人世。正是因为我的内心充满了对旧日的回忆、对过往的感怀，甚至只是看你一眼，我就会回想起有关他的往事。正是因为所有这些事情，现在我才不得不温和地对待你——是的，爱德华·黎福特，即使是现在——你不配拥有这个姓氏，我为你感到羞愧。”","“It is because I was your father’s oldest friend, young man,” returned Mr. Brownlow; “it is because the hopes and wishes of young and happy years were bound up with him, and that fair creature of his blood and kindred who rejoined her God in youth, and left me here a solitary, lonely man:it is because he knelt with me beside his only sisters’ death-bed when he was yet a boy, on the morning that would—but Heaven willed otherwise—have made her my young wife; it is because my seared heart clung to him, from that time forth, through all his trials and errors, till he died;it is because old recollections and associations filled my heart, and even the sight of you brings with it old thoughts of him; it is because of all these things that I am moved to treat you gently now—yes, Edward Leeford, even now—and blush for your unworthiness who bear the name.”"
"“这跟姓氏有什么关系？”另一个人一言不发地沉思了一会儿，然后问道。他实在想不通，身边的人为何会如此激动，“这姓氏跟我又有什么关系呢？”","“What has the name to do with it?” asked the other, after contemplating, half in silence, and half in dogged wonder, the agitation of his companion.“What is the name to me?”"
"“没有，”布朗洛先生回答，“跟你没有关系。但是，这是——她的——姓氏。尽管已经过了这么长时间，但只要有人提起这个姓氏，就算那只是个陌生人，我这个垂暮之人都会像当年那样全身发热、激动难抑。我非常高兴你改了姓氏——非常——非常高兴。”","“Nothing,” replied Mr. Brownlow, “nothing to you.But it was—hers—, and even at this distance of time brings back to me, an old man, the glow and thrill which I once felt, only to hear it repeated by a stranger.I am very glad you have changed it—very—very.”"
"“这真是再好不过了。”蒙克斯（在此保留他的化名）开口说。在此之前他沉默了很久，只是生着闷气，前前后后使劲地晃动身体，一副公然挑衅的样子。布朗洛先生则坐了下来，用双手遮着脸。“但是你到底想要我干什么？”","“This is all mighty fine,” said Monks (to retain his assumed designation) after a long silence, during which he had jerked himself in sullen defiance to and fro, and Mr. Brownlow had sat, shading his face with his hand.“But what do you want with me?”"
"“你有一个弟弟，”布朗洛先生振作了一下精神，然后说道，“你有一个弟弟。在街上的时候，我走到你身后，在你耳边低声念了他的名字。我只凭这个名字，就足以让你自愿跟着我回到这儿来，也足以让你一路心神不宁、坐立不安。”","“You have a brother,” said Mr. Brownlow, rousing himself: “a brother, the whisper of whose name in your ear when I came behind you in the street, was, in itself, almost enough to make you accompany me hither, in wonder and alarm.”"
"“我没有什么弟弟。”蒙克斯回答，“你知道我是独子。为什么你要跟我说起兄弟的事？这件事你跟我一样清楚。”","“I have no brother,” replied Monks.“You know I was an only child.Why do you talk to me of brothers?You know that, as well as I.”"
"“你给我仔细听着。有些事我很了解，而你却可能不知道。”布朗洛先生说，“慢慢地，我会让你产生兴趣的。我知道那场不幸的婚姻，是家族荣誉和最肮脏狭隘的抱负野心强迫了你那不幸的父亲，当时他还仅仅是个孩子，而你就是那场婚姻唯一的，也是最不自然的结果。”","“Attend to what I do know, and you may not,” said Mr. Brownlow.“I shall interest you by and by.I know that of the wretched marriage, into which family pride, and the most sordid and narrowest of all ambition, forced your unhappy father when a mere boy, you were the sole and most unnatural issue.”"
"“我不介意骂人的话。”蒙克斯嘲弄地笑了笑，打断了他，“你知道事实，这对我来说就已经足够了。”","“I don’t care for hard names,” interrupted Monks with a jeering laugh.“You know the fact, and that’s enough for me.”"
"“但我也知道，”老绅士继续说，“那场不相配的结合带来的苦难、一点一滴的折磨以及无休无止的痛苦。我知道那对不幸的夫妇双双拖着沉重的枷锁，在这毒害了他们的人世间，过得有多么无精打采、厌倦消沉。我也知道，冷冰冰的拘谨后来是怎样变成公开的嘲讽，漠不关心是怎样被不喜欢取代，不喜欢是怎样变成了讨厌，而讨厌又怎样变成了嫌恶，直到最后他们将那条叮当作响的锁链扭断，各自带着一截难堪的碎片分开得远远的，但只有他们死时才能将那碎链条彻底挣开。他们在新的社交圈子尽量装出一副快乐无忧的样子，把这碎片藏匿其下。你的母亲成功了，她很快就忘记了这一切。但在你父亲心里，这截碎片却存在了很多年，一直在生锈、腐烂。”","“But I also know,” pursued the old gentleman, “the misery, the slow torture, the protracted anguish of that ill-assorted union.I know how listlessly and wearily each of that wretched pair dragged on their heavy chain through a world that was poisoned to them both.I know how cold formalities were succeeded by open taunts; how indifference gave place to dislike, dislike to hate, and hate to loathing, until at last they wrenched the clanking bond asunder, and retiring a wide space apart, carried each a galling fragment, of which nothing but death could break the rivets, to hide it in new society beneath the gayest looks they could assume.Your mother succeeded; she forgot it soon.But it rusted and cankered at your father’s heart for years.”"
"“咳，他们分居了，”蒙克斯说，“那又怎么样呢？”","“Well, they were separated,” said Monks, “and what of that?”"
"“他们分居一段时间后，”布朗洛先生回答，“你的母亲在欧洲大陆寻欢作乐、沉溺放纵，把小她足足十岁的年轻丈夫忘得一干二净。他那时前途无望，暂时留在了国内，结识了一些新朋友。这个情况，你最起码是知道的。”","“When they had been separated for some time,” returned Mr. Brownlow, “and your mother, wholly given up to continental frivolities, had utterly forgotten the young husband ten good years her junior, who, with prospects blighted, lingered on at home, he fell among new friends.This circumstance, at least, you know already.”"
"“我不知道，”蒙克斯说道。他把目光移向别处，用脚拍打着地面，像是打定主意要否认一切，“我不知道。”","“Not I,” said Monks, turning away his eyes and beating his foot upon the ground, as a man who is determined to deny everything.“Not I.”"
"“看了你的态度和你的行动后，我很确定，你不仅从未忘记过这件事，还时常痛苦地想起它。”布朗洛先生回答，“我说的是十五年前，你那时最多十一岁，而你父亲也只有三十一岁——因为他，我再重复一遍，他只是个孩子——当——他的——父亲命令他结婚的时候。你是非要让我重提那些事情，给关于你父亲的回忆蒙上阴影呢，还是省下这麻烦，把真相明明白白地告诉我？”","“Your manner, no less than your actions, assures me that you have never forgotten it, or ceased to think of it with bitterness,” returned Mr. Brownlow.“I speak of fifteen years ago, when you were not more than eleven years old, and your father but one-and-thirty—for he was, I repeat, a boy, when—his—father ordered him to marry.Must I go back to events which cast a shade upon the memory of your parent, or will you spare it, and disclose to me the truth?”"
"“我没什么可以告诉你的。”蒙克斯回答，“如果你愿意，尽管继续说下去。”","“I have nothing to disclose,” rejoined Monks.“You must talk on if you will.”"
"“那时候，在那些新朋友里，”布朗洛先生说，“有一个退役了的海军军官。他的妻子大约半年前死了，留给他两个孩子——本来还有更多的，但他们家的孩子里运气好活下来的就只剩两个。两个都是女儿，一个是十九岁的美人，另一个是只有两三岁大的孩子。”","“These new friends, then,” said Mr. Brownlow, “were a naval officer retired from active service, whose wife had died some half-a-year before, and left him with two children—there had been more, but, of all their family, happily but two survived.They were both daughters; one a beautiful creature of nineteen, and the ot her a mere child of two or three years old.”"
"“这跟我有什么关系呢？”蒙克斯问道。","“What’s this to me?” asked Monks."
"“他们住在，”布朗洛先生似乎没有听到他插嘴了，继续说道，“乡下的一个地方。你父亲也徘徊到了那一带，他在那儿住了下来。他们相识了，彼此愈来愈亲密，很快就成为了朋友。你父亲的天赋很少有人能比得上。他拥有他姐姐那样的情操和容貌。老军官对他越来越了解，也就越来越喜欢他。我宁愿一切到此为止。老军官的女儿和她父亲一样，也越来越喜欢他。”","“They resided,” said Mr. Brownlow, without seeming to hear the interruption, “in a part of the country to which your father in his wandering had repaired, and where he had taken up his abode.Acquaintance, intimacy, friendship, fast followed on each other.Your father was gifted as few men are.He had his sister’s soul and person.As the old officer knew him more and more, he grew to love him.I would that it had ended there.His daughter did the same.”"
"老绅士顿了顿，但他见蒙克斯咬着嘴唇，双眼紧盯着地板，又立刻说了下去：“年底的时候他订了婚，庄严神圣地和那个姑娘订了婚。这是那个天真无邪的姑娘第一次、也是仅有的一次真诚热烈的爱情。”","The old gentleman paused; Monks was biting his lips, with his eyes fixed upon the floor; seeing this, he immediately resumed: “The end of a year found him contracted, solemnly contracted, to that daughter; the object of the first, true, ardent, only passion of a guileless girl.”"
"“你的故事可真够长的。”蒙克斯评论道，他一刻不停在椅子上动来动去。","“Your tale is of the longest,” observed Monks, moving restlessly in his chair."
"“这是一个真实的故事，充满了不幸、苦难和悲伤，年轻人，”布朗洛先生继续说，“这种故事通常都是这样；如果一个故事里只剩下欢乐幸福，那个故事通常会非常简短。最后，你家的一个有钱的亲戚，之前就是这个人，为了巩固自己的利益和地位，牺牲了你父亲，这种事别人也常遇到——并不是件稀罕事——那亲戚死了，为了弥补他一手造成的不幸，他把他认为能救治所有不幸的万能灵药留给了你的父亲——钱。你父亲必须马上赶去罗马。那亲戚本来在那里休养，结果却死在了那里，留下了一堆乱七八糟的事务。你父亲去了，在那里得了不治之症。消息一传到巴黎，你母亲就带着你跟去了。她到的第二天，他就死了，没有留下遗嘱——没有遗嘱——于是所有的财产就归你母亲和你所有了。”","“It is a true tale of grief and trial, and sorrow, young man,” returned Mr. Brownlow, “and such tales usually are; if it were one of unmixed joy and happiness, it would be very brief.At length one of those rich relations to strengthen whose interest and importance your father had been sacrificed, as others are often—it is no uncommon case—died, and to repair the misery he had been instrumental in occasioning, left him his panacea for all griefs—Money.It was necessary that he should immediately repair to Rome, whither this man had sped for health, and where he had died, leaving his affairs in great confusion.He went; was seized with mortal illness there; was followed, the moment the intelligence reached Paris, by your mother who carried you with her; he died the day after her arrival, leaving no will—no will—so that the whole property fell to her and you.”"
"布朗洛先生说到这一段往事的时候，蒙克斯尽管没有看着他的眼睛，却屏息聆听着他的话，一脸的急切。布朗洛先生顿了顿，蒙克斯也立即换了个姿势。他擦了擦自己发热的脸和双手，好像在那一瞬间，他卸下了什么重担似的。","At this part of the recital Monks held his breath, and listened with a face of intense eagerness, though his eyes were not directed towards the speaker.As Mr. Brownlow paused, he changed his position with the air of one who has experienced a sudden relief, and wiped his hot face and hands."
"“你父亲出国之前，路过伦敦，”布朗洛先生一字一顿地说，眼睛盯着对方的脸，“他来找过我。”","“Before he went abroad, and as he passed through London on his way,” said Mr. Brownlow, slowly, and fixing his eyes upon the other’s face, “he came to me.”"
"“我从没听过有这回事。”蒙克斯打断他。他本想从语气中表现出自己的怀疑，但话一出口，听上去更多的反而是不快和惊讶。","“I never heard of that,” interrupted Monks in a tone intended to appear incredulous, but savouring more of disagreeable surprise."
"“他去找我，在我那儿留下一些东西。其中有一幅画像——他自己亲手画的一幅肖像——是那位可怜姑娘的一幅画像——他本不想把画留下，但却没法带着它匆匆上路。他被焦虑和懊悔折磨得形销骨立、精神恍惚。他语无伦次地谈到他造成的祸患与耻辱，向我吐露了他的打算。他准备不计一切代价，把他所有的财产转换成现金，把他新得财产的一部分授予他的妻子和你，然后就立刻启程前往国外——我完全猜得到，他不会只身离开——再也不会回来。即使对我，他多年的老友，我们之间的情谊深深扎根于这片埋葬了我们两人最爱的土地——即使是对我，他也忍住没有透露更详细的计划，只是允诺会写信告诉我全部，并且在那之后再见我一面，在这片土地上的最后一面。唉！——那——就是最后一次。我没收到信，也没再见过他。","“He came to me, and left with me, among some other things, a picture—a portrait painted by himself—a likeness of this poor girl—which he did not wish to leave behind, and could not carry forward on his hasty journey.He was worn by anxiety and remorse almost to a shadow; talked in a wild, distracted way, of ruin and dishonour worked by himself; confided to me his intention to convert his whole property, at any loss, into money, and, having settled on his wife and you a portion of his recent acquisition, to fly the country—I guessed too well he would not fly alone—and never see it more.Even from me, his old and early friend, whose strong attachment had taken root in the earth that covered one most dear to both—even from me he withheld any more particular confession, promising to write and tell me all, and after that to see me once again, for the last time on earth.Alas!—That—was the last time.I had no letter, and I never saw him more.”"
"“我去了，”布朗洛先生稍稍顿了顿，又接着说道，“当所有事情过去之后，我去了那个地方——我将使用全世界都用得毫无顾忌的那个词，因为世俗的苛责和赞许对他来说已经没什么两样了——那个他结下孽缘的地方。我下定决心，如果我的担心成真的话，那个犯了错的孩子应该需要一颗怜悯同情她的心，更需要一个可以庇佑她的家。那家人一个星期前就离开了那一带。他们结清了各种债务，尽管数额都很小，但他们绝不含糊，用对待巨额债务的态度处理妥当，然后连夜离开了那个地方。他们为什么这么做，他们去了哪里，却无人知晓。”","“I went,” said Mr. Brownlow, after a short pause, “I went, when all was over, to the scene of his—I will use the term the world would freely use, for worldly harshness or favour are now alike to him—of his guilty love, resolved that if my fears were realised that erring child should find one heart and home to shelter and compassionate her.The family had left that part a week before; they had called in such trifling debts as were outstanding, discharged them, and left the place by night.Why, or whither, none can tell.”"
"蒙克斯舒了口气，呼吸畅快多了，还带着胜利的微笑环顾了一下四周。","Monks drew his breath yet more freely, and looked round with a smile of triumph."
"“当你弟弟，”布朗洛先生一边说，一边朝对方的椅子挪了挪，“当你的弟弟，一个身体虚弱、衣衫褴褛、被人忽视的孩子，被一只比偶然更为有力的手推到我面前的时候，我把他从罪恶耻辱的生活中解救了出来——”“什么？”蒙克斯叫道。","“When your brother,” said Mr. Brownlow, drawing nearer to the other’s chair, “When your brother: a feeble, ragged, neglected child: was cast in my way by a stronger hand than chance, and rescued by me from a life of vice and infamy—” “What?” cried Monks."
"“是我救了他。”布朗洛先生说道，“我跟你说过，我很快就能让你产生兴趣的。我说是我救了他——我知道你狡猾的同伙隐瞒了我的名字，尽管他应该清楚我是谁；你听到这名字反而会觉得陌生吧。他被我救了后，就住在我家里养病。他长得酷似我刚提过的那幅肖像，这让我非常震惊。我第一次见他时，他满身泥垢、处境悲惨。但即使是在那个时候，他的脸上仍然留存着一种表情。我一见那种表情，就觉得好像身处一个逼真的梦境之中，瞥见某个老朋友在我面前一闪而过。我没必要告诉你，我还没来得及了解他的过去，他就被人设计拐走了——”“为什么没这必要呢？”蒙克斯连忙问。","“By me,” said Mr. Brownlow.“I told you I should interest you before long.I say by me—I see that your cunning associate suppressed my name, although for ought he knew, it would be quite strange to your ears.When he was rescued by me, then, and lay recovering from sickness in my house, his strong resemblance to this picture I have spoken of, struck me with astonishment.Even when I first saw him in all his dirt and misery, there was a lingering expression in his face that came upon me like a glimpse of some old friend flashing on one in a vivid dream.I need not tell you he was snared away before I knew his history—” “Why not?” asked Monks hastily."
"“因为这件事你自己心里有数。”","“Because you know it well.”"
"“我！”","“I!”"
"“在我面前，否认是没用的。”布朗洛先生回答，“我还会告诉你，我还知道的还不止这些。”","“Denial to me is vain,” replied Mr. Brownlow.“I shall show you that I know more than that.”"
"“你——你——你证明不了任何对我不利的事情。”蒙克斯结结巴巴地说，“我谅你也做不到！”","“You—you—can’t prove anything against me,” stammered Monks.“I defy you to do it!”"
"“我们走着瞧。”老绅士带着探究的目光扫了他一眼，回答道，“我失去了那个孩子，不论我怎么努力，都没法把他找回来。你母亲已经死了，我知道如果还有谁能解开谜团，只可能是你。我最后一次听到你的消息时，你在西印度群岛自己的产业那儿——为什么在那儿，你自己清楚。你母亲一死，你就用退隐来逃避在这里种下的恶果——我又渡海去找你。几个月前你就已经离开了，有人说你在伦敦，但是没人能说出具体在哪儿。于是我又回来了。你的几个代理人对你的住处也是一无所知。他们说，你来去无踪，像以前一样怪异。有时好几天都和他们呆在一起，有时一连几个月也不见人影。很显然，你还混迹于以前那些低俗场所，和同一帮声名狼藉的家伙混在一起；当你还是个无法无天的孩子时，你就已经和他们打成一片了。我老是去找他们打听，他们都不胜其烦了。我没日没夜地在街上踱步，但是直到两小时前，我付出的所有努力都还毫无收获，我一次都没看见过你。”","“We shall see,” returned the old gentleman with a searching glance.“I lost the boy, and no efforts of mine could recover him.Your mother being dead, I knew that you alone could solve the mystery if anybody could, and as when I had last heard of you you were on your own estate in the West Indies—whither, as you well know, you retired upon your mother’s death to escape the consequences of vicious courses here—I made the voyage.You had left it, months before, and were supposed to be in London, but no one could tell where.I returned.Your agents had no clue to your residence.You came and went, they said, as strangely as you had ever done: sometimes for days together and sometimes not for months: keeping to all appearance the same low haunts and mingling with the same infamous herd who had been your associates when a fierce ungovernable boy.I wearied them with new applications.I paced the streets by night and day, but until two hours ago, all my efforts were fruitless, and I never saw you for an instant.”"
"“那现在你可见着我了，”蒙克斯大大咧咧地站了起来，说道，“可那又怎么样？诈骗和抢劫听起来都是很了不得的字眼——你认为仅凭你的胡乱猜想，说某个年幼小鬼长得酷似一幅画像，那幅画还是一个将死之人的无聊涂鸦，就能证明什么吗！你甚至不知道那对痴情种有没有生下一个孩子，你甚至连那都不知道。”","“And now you do see me,” said Monks, rising boldly, “what then?Fraud and robbery are high-sounding words—justified, you think, by a fancied resemblance in some young imp to an idle daub of a dead man’s Brother!You don’t even know that a child was born of this maudlin pair; you don’t even know that.”"
"“我——以前不知道——”布朗洛先生也站了起来，回答道，“但是在过去两个星期里，我已经知道了全部。你有一个弟弟，你知道的，而且你也认识他。曾经有过一份遗嘱，但你母亲把那份遗嘱销毁了。她死的时候，把这个秘密和得到的好处都留给了你。那遗嘱里提到了某个孩子。那场可悲的结合可能会有结果，就是那个孩子。他还是出生了，并且意外地被你遇见了。你一见他长得酷似你父亲，就起了疑心。你去过他出生的地方。那儿留有证据——被长期掩盖的证据——关于他的出生和血统的证据。你毁掉了那些证据，现在，援引你对你的同伙犹太佬说的话‘——仅有的几件能证明那孩子身份的证据已经沉入河底，而从他母亲那儿得到这些东西的丑老太婆也已经烂在了棺材里——’。”“不孝子、懦夫、骗子——你，深夜在暗室里和盗贼与杀人犯们密谋——你，你的阴谋诡计让一个比你好千万倍的姑娘惨死——你，打从在摇篮里就是自己父亲心中的苦胆，邪恶欲望、罪恶行径、挥霍恶习，这一切都在你身上溃烂，直到在一种丑恶的病态中找到了发泄口。这种病态甚至让你的心中所想在你脸上暴露无遗——你，爱德华·黎福特，你还敢不把我放在眼里！”","“I—did not—,” replied Mr. Brownlow, rising too; “but within the last fortnight I have learnt it all.You have a brother; you know it, and him.There was a will, which your mother destroyed, leaving the secret and the gain to you at her own death.It contained a reference to some child likely to be the result of this sad connection, which child was born, and accidentally encountered by you, when your suspicions were first awakened by his resemblance to your father.You repaired to the place of his birth.There existed proofs—proofs long suppressed—of his birth and parentage.Those proofs were destroyed by you, and now, in your own words to your accomplice the Jew, “—the only proofs of the boy’s identity lie at the bottom of the river, and the old hag that received them from the mother is rotting in her coffin—.”“Unworthy son, coward, liar,—you, who hold your councils with thieves and murderers in dark rooms at night,—you, whose plots and wiles have brought a violent death upon the head of one worth millions such as you,—you, who from your cradle were gall and bitterness to your own father’s heart,and in whom all evil passions, vice, and profligacy, festered, till they found a vent in a hideous disease which had made your face an index even to your mind—you, Edward Leeford, do you still brave me!”"
"“不，不，不！”那懦夫被这一个接一个的控诉压倒，只得这样回答。","“No, no, no!” returned the coward, overwhelmed by these accumulated charges."
"“每一个字眼！”绅士叫道，“你和那个可恶的恶棍说的每一个字眼我都知道。墙上的影子听见了你们的耳语，把你们的话传到了我耳朵里，看见那孩子受如此迫害，让一个曾经作恶的姑娘痛改前非，还给了她勇气和几乎是美德的品性。凶案已经发生了，即使你不是真正的同党，在道德上也难辞其咎。”","“Every word!” cried the gentleman, “every word that has passed between you and this detested villain, is known to me.Shadows on the wall have caught your whispers, and brought them to my ear; the sight of the persecuted child has turned vice itself, and given it the courage and almost the attributes of virtue.Murder has been done, to which you were morally if not really a party.”"
"“不，不。”蒙克斯插嘴道，“我——我对那事可一点也不知情。你赶上我的时候，我正要去询问那件事情的原委。我不知道起因。我原本以为那是一场普通的争吵。”","“No, no,” interposed Monks.“I—I knew nothing of that; I was going to inquire the truth of the story when you overtook me.I didn’t know the cause.I thought it was a common quarrel.”"
"“你的秘密我还没有全部揭露出来。”布朗洛先生回答，“你愿意全部讲出来吗？”","“It was the partial disclosure of your secrets,” replied Mr. Brownlow.“Will you disclose the whole?”"
"“是的，我愿意。”","“Yes, I will.”"
"“你愿意签署一份有关真相和事实的声明，并当着证人的面复述吗？”","“Set your hand to a statement of truth and facts, and repeat it before witnesses?”"
"“这我也向您保证。”","“That I promise too.”"
"“安安静静呆在这里，写好这份文件，然后再跟着我去一个我认为最合适的地方，证明这份文件的真实性，你愿意吗？”","“Remain quietly here, until such a document is drawn up, and proceed with me to such a place as I may deem most advisable, for the purpose of attesting it?”"
"“如果您坚持要那样，我也会照做的。”蒙克斯回答。","“If you insist upon that, I’ll do that also,” replied Monks."
"“你要做的还不止那些。”布朗洛先生说，“你必须赔偿那个天真无辜、无意伤害任何人的孩子。他本身没有错，尽管他是一场有罪而不幸的爱情的结果。那份遗嘱里的条款，你肯定还未忘记。执行与你弟弟有关的条款，之后你想去哪里，随你喜欢。在这个世界上，你们不需要再见面了。","“You must do more than that,” said Mr. Brownlow.“Make restitution to an innocent and unoffending child, for such he is, although the offspring of a guilty and most miserable love.You have not forgotten the provisions of the will.Carry them into execution so far as your brother is concerned, and then go where you please.In this world you need meet no more.”"
"蒙克斯踱来踱去，满脸阴沉邪恶的表情。他正思考着这项提议以及逃避它的可能性。他一方面恐惧害怕，另一方面又心怀仇恨，这让他左右为难，这种感觉简直要把他撕扯成两半。这时候，门被匆匆打开了，一位绅士（罗斯伯力先生）激动万分地走进了房间。","While Monks was pacing up and down, meditating with dark and evil looks on this proposal and the possibilities of evading it: torn by his fears on the one hand and his hatred on the other: the door was hurriedly unlocked, and a gentleman (Mr. Losberne) entered the room in violent agitation."
"“那人要被抓住了，”他叫道，“今晚他就要被抓住了！”","“The man will be taken,” he cried.“He will be taken to-night!”"
"“那个凶手吗？”布朗洛先生问。","“The murderer?” asked Mr. Brownlow."
"“是的，是的。”对方回答，“有人看见，他的狗在他常出没的一个地方附近偷偷转悠。看来几乎可以肯定了，那狗的主人要么现在就在那儿，要么将会在夜色掩护下到那儿去。那个地方的四周围都有侦探在转悠。我和负责逮捕他的人说过话了，他们告诉我，他肯定跑不了。政府今晚公布了一百英镑的悬赏。”","“Yes, yes,” replied the other.“His dog has been seen lurking about some old haunt, and there seems little doubt that his master either is, or will be, there, under cover of the darkness.Spies are hovering about in every direction.I have spoken to the men who are charged with his capture, and they tell me he cannot escape.A reward of a hundred pounds is proclaimed by Government to-night.”"
"“我愿意再追加五十镑，”布朗洛先生说，“并且会在现场亲自宣布，如果我能赶到那儿的话。梅莱先生在哪儿？”","“I will give fifty more,” said Mr. Brownlow, “and proclaim it with my own lips upon the spot, if I can reach it.Where is Mr. Maylie?”"
"“哈里？他一看见你这位朋友在这儿，还和你相安无事地坐在马车里，就急急忙忙前往他打听到这则消息的地方了，”医生回答，“他们事先商量好，会在郊区某个地方会和，他一上马就奔去了那儿，要去加入第一拨搜查队伍。”","“Harry?As soon as he had seen your friend here, safe in a coach with you, he hurried off to where he heard this,” replied the doctor, “and mounting his horse sallied forth to join the first party at some place in the outskirts agreed upon between them.”"
"“费金呢，”布朗洛先生说，“他怎么样？”","“Fagin,” said Mr. Brownlow; “what of him?”"
"“我最近一次打听的时候，他还没被逮住，但他肯定没法走脱，或许这个时候已经被逮住了。他们对他很有把握。”","“When I last heard, he had not been taken, but he will be, or is, by this time.They’re sure of him.”"
"“你决定好了吗？”布朗洛先生低声问蒙克斯。","“Have you made up your mind?” asked Mr. Brownlow, in a low voice, of Monks."
"“是的。”他回答，“你——你——会替我保密吗？”","“Yes,” he replied.“You—you—will be secret with me?”"
"“我会的。呆在这里，直到我回来。这是保你安全的唯一希望。”","“I will.Remain here till I return.It is your only hope of safety.”"
"他们离开了房间，房门再次被落了锁。","They left the room, and the door was again locked."
"“你都做了些什么？”医生低声问道。","“What have you done?” asked the doctor in a whisper."
"“所有我希望做的事，甚至还做了更多。将那可怜姑娘得到的消息和我以前所知结合起来，再加上我们的好朋友在现场的调查结果，我没留任何容他逃避的空子。我还将他的全部恶行都揭露了出来，有了这些事实，那些恶行变得像白昼一样清楚明白。写信通知大家，后天晚上七点钟会面。我们必须提前几个小时到那儿，但之前还是要休息一下；尤其是那位年轻的小姐，她——可能——需要坚强些，比你我现在能预见的还要更加坚强些。但我的血液已经沸腾了，我要为那被谋杀的可怜姑娘报仇。他们走了哪条路？”","“All that I could hope to do, and even more.Coupling the poor girl’s intelligence with my previous knowledge, and the result of our good friend’s inquiries on the spot, I left him no loophole of escape, and laid bare the whole villainy which by these lights became plain as day.Write and appoint the evening after to-morrow, at seven, for the meeting.We shall be down there, a few hours before, but shall require rest: especially the young lady, who—may—have greater need of firmness than either you or I can quite foresee just now.But my blood boils to avenge this poor murdered creature.Which way have they taken?”"
"“他们直接去了警察局，不过你能及时赶到的。”罗斯伯力先生回答，“我会留在这里。”","“Drive straight to the office and you will be in time,” replied Mr. Losberne.“I will remain here.”"
"两位绅士匆匆分别，彼此都激动不已，兴奋得难以自抑。","The two gentlemen hastily separated; each in a fever of excitement wholly uncontrollable."
"第五十章 逃与追","CHAPTER L The pursuit and escape"
"在泰晤士河临近罗瑟西斯教堂的那一带，河上的煤船带来了煤渣灰尘，紧紧挨在一起的低矮房屋里也冒出滚滚烟尘；两岸的建筑是全伦敦最脏的，河上的船也是最黑的。那里隐藏着很多伦敦最肮脏、最奇怪、最不寻常的地方。这些地方藏得很深，里面的大多数居民甚至连这些地方叫什么名字都不知道。","Near to that part of the Thames on which the church at Rotherhithe abuts, where the buildings on the banks are dirtiest and the vessels on the river blackest with the dust of colliers and the smoke of close-built low-roofed houses,there exists the filthiest, the strangest, the most extraordinary of the many localities that are hidden in London, wholly unknown, even by name, to the great mass of its inhabitants."
"要到达这个地方，来客必须穿过一片迷宫，里面全是狭窄、泥泞的街道，街与街之间没有多大空隙。那里聚集着最不幸、最贫穷的水上人家，他们所做的买卖可想而知。最廉价、最粗糙的食物堆积在商店里，最粗劣、最普通的衣物悬挂在商家的门前，在房子的矮墙和窗户上迎风招展。他在最下等的无业人员、搬压舱物的挑夫、煤炭装卸工、厚颜无耻的女人、衣衫褴褛的孩童以及河里的垃圾废物中挤来挤去，困难地前行。左右叉开的狭窄小巷里不时闪过令人不忍卒视的景象，散发出极为难闻的气味；笨重的马车拉载着大堆的货物，从遍布于各个角落的货栈仓库中驶了出来，发出震耳欲聋的撞击声。来客最终到了一条街上。这条街比他之前经过的地方都要偏僻、人迹更少。他从摇摇欲坠、延伸到人行道上的房子正面走过，经过随时会倒下的残垣断壁。不少烟囱已塌了一半，另一半正在犹豫是否要倒下。窗户装着生锈的铁护栏，几乎被岁月和污垢侵蚀殆尽，所有别人能想到的荒芜破落景象，在这儿无处不在。","To reach this place, the visitor has to penetrate through a maze of close, narrow, and muddy streets, thronged by the roughest and poorest of waterside people, and devoted to the traffic they may be supposed to occasion.The cheapest and least delicate provisions are heaped in the shops; the coarsest and commonest articles of wearing apparel dangle at the salesman’s door, and stream from the house-parapet and windows.Jostling with unemployed labourers of the lowest class, ballast-heavers, coal-whippers, brazen women, ragged children, and the raff and refuse of the river, he makes his way with difficulty along, assailed by offensive sights and smells from the narrow alleys which branch off on the right and left, and deafened by the clash of ponderous waggons that bear great piles of merchandise from the stacks of warehouses that rise from every corner.Arriving, at length, in streets remoter and less-frequented than those through which he has passed, he walks beneath tottering house-fronts projecting over the pavement, dismantled walls that seem to totter as he passes, chimneys half crushed half hesitating to fall, windows guarded by rusty iron bars that time and dirt have almost eaten away, every imaginable sign of desolation and neglect."
"在这个区里，萨瑟克区的多克希德再往前一些的地方，坐落着雅各布岛。这个岛被一条满是泥泞的沟渠环绕；涨潮的时候，那沟渠能有六到八英尺深，十五到二十英尺宽。这条沟曾经叫做磨坊池，但在此时人们管它叫荒唐沟。这条沟渠是从泰晤士河流出的一条小溪或水湾。涨潮时只要打开利德磨坊的水闸，水面就会升至最高，磨坊池这一名字由此而来。在这种时候，如果一个外地人从磨坊路上某条横跨沟渠的木桥上朝下望去，就会看见两侧屋内的居民从他们的后门和窗户放下吊桶、提桶和家里各种各样的器皿，再用这些器皿把水拉上去。此时他若将目光从这些放下拉起的动作上移开，转到房子本身上，映入他眼帘的这番景象准会让他惊愕万分。每五六所房子聚成了一群，每群房子的背面共用一条七零八落、胡拼乱凑出来的木走廊，透过走廊上的孔洞甚至可以看见下面的淤泥；窗户破破烂烂，满是修补过的痕迹；用来晾亚麻衣物的晾衣杆从窗户中横戳了出来，只是上面从来没有晾过衣服。房间太小、太脏、太密闭了，就算这里头是藏污纳垢之所，房里的空气还是太过污浊；木房子立在泥地之上，摇摇欲坠——有些已然倒下了。房子的墙壁上满是污垢、肮脏不堪，房基正在腐烂。从桥上望去，四处可见彰显贫穷的可憎轮廓，到处都是凸显污秽、腐朽和荒废的讨厌景象——这所有的一切装点了荒唐沟的两岸。","In such a neighborhood, beyond Dockhead in the Borough of Southwark, stands Jacob’s Island, surrounded by a muddy ditch, six or eight feet deep and fifteen or twenty wide when the tide is in, once called Mill Pond, but known in the days of this story as Folly Ditch.It is a creek or inlet from the Thames, and can always be filled at high water by opening the sluices at the Lead Mills from which it took its old name.At such times, a stranger, looking from one of the wooden bridges thrown across it at Mill Lane, will see the inhabitants of the houses on either side lowering from their back doors and windows, buckets, pails, domestic utensils of all kinds, in which to haul the water up;and when his eye is turned from these operations to the houses themselves, his utmost astonishment will be excited by the scene before him.Crazy wooden galleries common to the backs of half a dozen houses, with holes from which to look upon the slime beneath; windows, broken and patched, with poles thrust out, on which to dry the linen that is never there;rooms so small, so filthy, so confined, that the air would seem too tainted even for the dirt and squalor which they shelter; wooden chambers thrusting themselves out above the mud, and threatening to fall into it—as some have done;dirt-besmeared walls and decaying foundations; every repulsive lineament of poverty, every loathsome indication of filth, rot, and garbage; all these ornament the banks of Folly Ditch."
"在雅各布岛上，货栈没有屋顶，里面空空如也，墙壁几欲倒塌。窗户甚至不能算是窗户，门板倒在大街上，熏黑的烟囱从不冒烟。三四十年前，这里还不曾遭遇经济萧条和法律官司，是个繁华之地。但是现在，它已成了一座名副其实的荒岛。这里的房子都是无主的。有些人很有胆量，直接破门而入，一直住到他们死去。他们一定是出于很重要的原因，需要寻找一处隐秘居所，或是实在是一贫如洗了，才会在雅各布岛避难。","In Jacob’s Island, the warehouses are roofless and empty; the walls are crumbling down; the windows are windows no more; the doors are falling into the streets; the chimneys are blackened, but they yield no smoke.Thirty or forty years ago, before losses and chancery suits came upon it, it was a thriving place; but now it is a desolate island indeed.The houses have no owners; they are broken open, and entered upon by those who have the courage; and there they live, and there they die.They must have powerful motives for a secret residence, or be reduced to a destitute condition indeed, who seek a refuge in Jacob’s Island."
"在其中一栋房子楼上的房间里——这房子是所孤房，相当大，其他地方都破败不堪，但门和窗户都封得很严实。房子后面濒临沟渠，之前已经描述过了这种布局——房间里聚集了三个人。他们不时地打量着彼此，都是一脸的困惑和期待。三人一言不发地坐了很久，屋里的气氛很是阴沉。其中一人是托比·格拉基特，另一个是基特宁先生，第三个人是一个盗贼，入这行已经有五十年了。他的鼻子在过去的某场混战中被打扁了，脸上还带了道可怕的疤痕，或许也是同一场打斗中得来的。这人是个潜逃回国的流放犯，名叫凯格斯。","In an upper room of one of these houses—a detached house of fair size, ruinous in other respects, but strongly defended at door and window: of which house the back commanded the ditch in manner already described—there were assembled three men, who, regarding each other every now and then with looks expressive of perplexity and expectation, sat for some time in profound and gloomy silence.One of these was Toby Crackit, another Mr. Chitling, and the third a robber of fifty years, whose nose had been almost beaten in, in some old scuffle, and whose face bore a frightful scar which might probably be traced to the same occasion.This man was a returned transport, and his name was Kags."
"“我多么希望，”托比把脸转向基特宁先生，说道，“其他两个老窝呆不下去了的时候，你会另挑一个可藏身的地方，而不是来了这儿，我的好伙计。”","“I wish,” said Toby turning to Mr. Chitling, “that you had picked out some other crib when the two old ones got too warm, and had not come here, my fine feller.”"
"“你怎么就没那么干呢，你个榆木脑袋！”凯格斯说。","“Why didn’t you, blunder-head!” said Kags."
"“咳，我原以为比起你们现在的表现，你们见到我会更高兴一点儿呢。”基特宁先生回答道，一副忧伤沮丧的表情。","“Well, I thought you’d have been a little more glad to see me than this,” replied Mr. Chitling, with a melancholy air."
"“嗨，年轻人，你自己想想，”托比说，“一个像我这样独来独往的人，靠那种方法才给自己弄到了一间舒舒服服、没有人在周围打听探察的房子。这个时候，他居然有此荣幸，接待了一位跟你境况相同的年轻绅士（不论情况合适的时候，他可能是一位多么值得尊重、多么令人愉快的牌友），那可真让人吓一跳啊。”","“Why, look’e, young gentleman,” said Toby, “when a man keeps himself so very exclusive as I have done, and by that means has a snug house over his head with nobody a prying and smelling about it, it’s rather a startling thing to have the honour of a wisit from a young gentleman (however respectable and pleasant a person he may be to play cards with at conweniency) circumstanced as you are.”"
"“尤其是，这位独来独往的年轻人已经收留了一位朋友。这位朋友提前从国外回来了，而且他太过低调，不愿向法官报告他已经回国了。”凯格斯先生补充道。","“Especially, when the exclusive young man has got a friend stopping with him, that’s arrived sooner than was expected from foreign parts, and is too modest to want to be presented to the Judges on his return,” added Mr. Kags."
"他们又沉默了一小会儿。托比·格拉基特平日里趾高气扬，魔鬼见了也要发愁，此时却怎么也撑不起那架势了。他把脸转向基特宁先生，问道：“那么费金是什么时候被抓住的？”","There was a short silence, after which Toby Crackit, seeming to abandon as hopeless any further effort to maintain his usual devil-may-care swagger, turned to Chitling and said, “When was Fagin took then?”"
"“就在午饭的时候——今天下午两点。查利和我运气好，爬上洗衣房的烟囱逃走了。博尔特则一头栽进了一个又大又空的水桶里。可惜他的腿太长，两条都伸出了桶外，所以也被抓住了。”","“Just at dinner-time—two o’clock this afternoon.Charley and I made our lucky up the wash—us chimney, and Bolter got into the empty water-butt, head downwards; but his legs were so precious long that they stuck out at the top, and so they took him too.”"
"“那贝齐呢？”","“And Bet?”"
"“可怜的贝齐！她去看尸体，说是要和死者道别，”基特宁回答，说到这里，他的脸色越变越差，“然后就发了疯，又是尖叫又是怒吼，还用头撞地板。他们只好给她穿上束身衣，把她送去了医院——现在她还在那里。”","“Poor Bet!She went to see the Body, to speak to who it was,” replied Chitling, his countenance falling more and more, “and went off mad, screaming and raving, and beating her head against the boards; so they put a strait-weskut on her and took her to the hospital—and there she is.”"
"“小贝茨呢？”凯格斯问。","“Wot’s s come of young Bates?” demanded Kags."
"“他在附近转悠，天黑前不会过来，不过应该也快了。”基特宁回答，“现在除了这里，我们无处可去了。瘸子酒馆的人全被拘留了。我们那个窝——我去过一趟，亲眼看见——里面全是别人下的圈套。”","“He hung about, not to come over here afore dark, but he’ll be here soon,” replied Chitling.“There’s nowhere else to go to now, for the people at the Cripples are all in custody, and the bar of the ken—I went up there and see it with my own eyes—is filled with traps.”"
"“这可真是场大扫荡。”托比咬了咬嘴唇，评论道，“赔进去的人肯定不止一个。”","“This is a smash,” observed Toby, biting his lips.“There’s more than one will go with this.”"
"“而且现在正赶上是开庭期，”凯格斯说，“如果他们审问完毕，而博尔特供出了金的证据——他肯定会和盘托出，这从他之前说过的话就能看出——他们就能证明费金是事前从犯；周五就能开庭审讯，之后再过六天他就会被挂上绞刑架，在上头荡来荡去了，看在上帝——”","“The sessions are on,” said Kags: “if they get the inquest over, and Bolter turns King’s evidence: as of course he will, from what he’s said already: they can prove Fagin an accessory before the fact, and get the trial on on Friday, and he’ll swing in six days from this, by G—!”"
"“你们应该都已经听到，那些人抱怨得有多厉害了，”基特宁说，“要不是那些警察拼了命地压制，他们早就把他给撕了。有那么一次，他被拉了下去，幸好那些警察绕着他围了一个圈，硬是护着他闯了出去。你们真该看看他四下张望的那副样子。他浑身上下又是泥又是血，还死命地贴着那些警察，就好像他们是他关系最好的朋友一样。我现在还能看见，他们在民众的推挤下站都站不直，他被夹在人群当中拖走了。我能看见人们一个接一个地跳了起来，咬牙咆哮着冲向他。我还能看见，他的头发和胡子上都沾着血。在街的拐角处，那些娘们正使劲往人群中间挤；我能听见她们的喊叫，她们发誓要把他的心掏出来！”","“You should have heard the people groan,” said Chitling; “the officers fought like devils, or they’d have torn him away.He was down once, but they made a ring round him, and fought their way along.You should have seen how he looked about him, all muddy and bleeding, and clung to them as if they were his dearest friends.I can see ’em now, not able to stand upright with the pressing of the mob, and draggin him along amongst ’em; I can see the people jumping up, one behind another, and snarling with their teeth and making at him;I can see the blood upon his hair and beard, and hear the cries with which the women worked themselves into the centre of the crowd at the street corner, and swore they’d tear his heart out!”"
"这幅场景的目击者被吓坏了。他用手堵住耳朵站了起来，连眼睛都是闭着的；他还在屋里来来回回地踱步，跨步时又猛又用力，就像发狂了一样。","The horror-stricken witness of this scene pressed his hands upon his ears, and with his eyes closed got up and paced violently to and fro, like one distracted."
"正当他做出这种表现的时候，那两人静静地坐在旁边，眼睛盯着地板。这时楼梯上响起啪嗒啪嗒的声音，赛克斯的狗蹿进了房间。他们连忙跑向窗口看了看，接着又奔下楼，跑到了街上。狗是从一扇打开的窗户外跳进来的，他们跑出去时，它没有跟上来；他们也没看见它的主人。","While he was thus engaged, and the two men sat by in silence with their eyes fixed upon the floor, a pattering noise was heard upon the stairs, and Sikes’s dog bounded into the room.They ran to the window, downstairs, and into the street.The dog had jumped in at an open window; he made no attempt to follow them, nor was his master to be seen."
"“这到底是什么意思？”他们又回到了房间，托比开口道，“他肯定不会来这儿的。我——我——希望不会。”","“What’s the meaning of this?” said Toby when they had returned.“He can’t be coming here.I—I—hope not.”"
"“如果他要来这儿，就会跟狗一块儿过来。”凯格斯俯下身去检查那畜生，它正卧在地板上喘着粗气，“嘿！我们给它点儿水喝吧，它跑得没劲了。”","“If he was coming here, he’d have come with the dog,” said Kags, stooping down to examine the animal, who lay panting on the floor.“Here!Give us some water for him; he has run himself faint.”"
"“它都喝光了，一滴都没不剩。”基特宁一言不发地观察了这狗一会儿，说道，“它浑身是泥——腿瘸了——眼睛也几乎瞎了——它一定走了很长的路。”","“He’s drunk it all up, every drop,” said Chitling after watching the dog some time in silence.“Covered with mud—lame—half blind—he must have come a long way.”"
"“它能从哪儿来！”托比大叫，“它当然是从别的老窝那边过来的。它发现那些地方全是陌生人，就到这儿来了；它经常来这里，不知道来过多少次了。但是它一开始是打哪儿来呢？没有主人陪着，它又怎么会独自跑来这里！”","“Where can he have come from!” exclaimed Toby.“He’s been to the other kens of course, and finding them filled with strangers come on here, where he’s been many a time and often.But where can he have come from first, and how comes he here alone without the other!”"
"“他——（他们都不用凶手原来的名字称呼他）他不会自杀吧，你们觉得呢？”基特宁说道。","“He”—(none of them called the murderer by his old name)—”He can’t have made away with himself.What do you think?” said Chitling."
"托比摇摇头。","Toby shook his head."
"“如果他真那样做了，”凯格斯说，“他死在哪里，这狗会想要把我们领去那个地方的。他不会自杀的。我觉得他已经潜逃出国了，把这狗抛在了后头。他一定用什么方法偷偷甩掉了它，不然这狗不会这么老实。","“If he had,” said Kags, “the dog ’ud want to lead us away to where he did it.No.I think he’s got out of the country, and left the dog behind.He must have given him the slip somehow, or he wouldn’t be so easy.”"
"这种解答似乎是最有可能的，就被当作实情采纳了。那狗爬到了一把椅子下面，把自己蜷成一团睡了，谁都没再注意它。","This solution, appearing the most probable one, was adopted as the right; the dog, creeping under a chair, coiled himself up to sleep, without more notice from anybody."
"此刻天已经黑了下来。他们关上了窗板，只点燃了一支蜡烛，放到了桌上。这两天发生的这些可怕事件给三个人留下了极深的印象。他们此时处境危险、吉凶难料，这种印象更是有增无减。他们挪动着椅子，彼此越靠越近；一有风吹草动，三个人就会吓得从椅子上跳起来。他们不怎么说话，即使偶尔开口，声音也被压得很低。他们就这样安安静静、满心敬畏地呆着，仿佛那个被谋杀的女人的尸体正躺在隔壁房间里。","It being now dark, the shutter was closed, and a candle lighted and placed upon the table.The terrible events of the last two days had made a deep impression on all three, increased by the danger and uncertainty of their own position.They drew their chairs closer together, starting at every sound.They spoke little, and that in whispers, and were as silent and awe-stricken as if the remains of the murdered woman lay in the next room."
"他们就这样坐了一会儿。这时，楼下突然传来一阵急促的敲门声。","They had sat thus, some time, when suddenly was heard a hurried knocking at the door below."
"“这个小贝茨。”凯格斯说着，愤怒地环顾四周，以压制自己的恐惧。","“Young Bates,” said Kags, looking angrily round, to check the fear he felt himself."
"敲门声又来了。不，不是贝茨。他从来不那样敲门。","The knocking came again.No, it wasn’t he.He never knocked like that."
"格拉基特走到窗边，又浑身哆嗦着把头缩了回来。已经没有必要告诉他们来人是谁了，他苍白的脸说明了一切。那狗也立刻警觉了起来，哀叫着朝门口跑去。","Crackit went to the window, and shaking all over, drew in his head.There was no need to tell them who it was; his pale face was enough.The dog too was on the alert in an instant, and ran whining to the door."
"“我们必须得让他进来。”格拉基特说着，拿起了蜡烛。","“We must let him in,” he said, taking up the candle."
"“就没什么别的法子吗？”另一个人哑着嗓子地问。","“Isn’t there any help for it?” asked the other man in a hoarse voice."
"“没有。他—决意要——进来。”","“None.He—must—come in.”"
"“别让我们俩呆在一间黑房里。”凯格斯说着，从壁炉台上取下一支蜡烛，想要点亮它。可他的手抖得太厉害了，在蜡烛亮起来前，敲门声又响了两次。","“Don’t leave us in the dark,” said Kags, taking down a candle from the chimney-piece, and lighting it, with such a trembling hand that the knocking was twice repeated before he had finished."
"格拉基特下楼去开门，回来时后面跟着一个人。那人的下半边脸被一条手帕遮住了，帽子下的脑袋上也系着一条。慢慢地，他解开了两条手帕。苍白的脸色、深陷的眼睛、凹下去的脸颊、三天没刮的胡子、消瘦的身体、短而粗重的呼吸，这简直是赛克斯的鬼魂。","Crackit went down to the door, and returned followed by a man with the lower part of his face buried in a handkerchief, and another tied over his head under his hat.He drew them slowly off.Blanched face, sunken eyes, hollow cheeks, beard of three days’ growth, wasted flesh, short thick breath; it was the very ghost of Sikes."
"他把手搭在屋中间的一张椅子上，正要坐上去，突然打了个哆嗦，似乎想要回头看看。他没这么做，而是把椅子向后拖，往墙边拖——直到近得不能再近了——直到抵到了墙上——这才坐了下来。","He laid his hand upon a chair which stood in the middle of the room, but shuddering as he was about to drop into it, and seeming to glance over his shoulder, dragged it back close to the wall—as close as it would go—and ground it against it—and sat down."
"这期间，这几个人都一言不发。他沉默不语，挨个打量他们。即使三人中有人偷偷抬眼，正好与他目光相碰了，也会立即把眼睛移开。当他空洞的声音打破沉默的时候，他们三个都吓了一大跳。好像他们以前从未听过他说话一样。","Not a word had been exchanged.He looked from one to another in silence.If an eye were furtively raised and met his, it was instantly averted.When his hollow voice broke silence, they all three started.They seemed never to have heard its tones before."
"“那狗怎么会在这儿？”他问。","“How came that dog here?” he asked."
"“它自己来的。三个小时前到的。”","“Alone.Three hours ago.”"
"“今晚的报纸说，费金被抓住了。是真的，还是骗人的？”","“To-night’s  paper says that Fagin’s took.Is it true, or a lie?”"
"“是真的。”","“True.”"
"他们又陷入了沉默。","They were silent again."
"“这些该死的混蛋！”赛克斯用手抹了抹额头，说道，","“Damn you all!” said Sikes, passing his hand across his forehead."
"“你们就没什么话要对我说吗？”","“Have you nothing to say to me?”"
"三个人动了动，都显得很局促不安，但还是没人说话。","There was an uneasy movement among them, but nobody spoke."
"“你是这房子的主人。”赛克斯把脸扭向格拉基特，说道，“你是打算出卖我，还是让我呆在这儿，直到这次搜捕结束？”","“You that keep this house,” said Sikes, turning his face to Crackit, “do you mean to sell me, or to let me lie here till this hunt is over?”"
"“你可以留在这里，如果你觉得这里安全的话。”被提问的人稍稍犹豫了一下，才这样回答道。","“You may stop here, if you think it safe,” returned the person addressed, after some hesitation."
"赛克斯抬起头来，慢慢看向他身后的墙；他似乎想要转过头去，但实际上并没有这么做。他开口问道：“它——尸体——它被埋了吗？”","Sikes carried his eyes slowly up the wall behind him: rather trying to turn his head than actually doing it: and said, “Is—it—the body—is it buried?”"
"他们摇了摇头。","They shook their heads."
"“为什么没有！”他又跟刚才一样往身后扫了一眼，抗议道，“他们为什么要把这样丑陋的东西留在地面上？——是谁在敲门？”","“Why isn’t it!” he retorted with the same glanve behind him.“Wot do they keep such ugly things above the ground for?—Who’s that knocking?”"
"格拉基特打了个手势，暗示他没什么好怕的，然后离开了房间。他很快又径直回来了，后面还跟着查利·贝茨。赛克斯正对着门坐着，男孩进屋一进门就看见了他。","Crackit intimated, by a motion of his hand as he left the room, that there was nothing to fear; and directly came back with Charley Bates behind him.Sikes sat opposite the door, so that the moment the boy entered the room he encountered his figure."
"“托比，”男孩叫了起来。赛克斯的目光一转向他，他就直往后退，“你怎么不告诉我这件事，你在楼下怎么没告诉我？”","“Toby,” said the boy falling back, as Sikes turned his eyes towards him, “why didn’t you tell me this, downstairs?”"
"那三个人畏畏缩缩，着实吓得不轻，连那坏人都想安慰一下这个少年了。于是他点了点头，伸出手来想跟他握手。","There had been something so tremendous in the shrinking off of the three, that the wretched man was willing to propitiate even this lad.Accordingly he nodded, and made as though he would shake hands with him."
"“带我去其他的房间。”男孩一边说，一边退得更远了。","“Let me go into some other room,” said the boy, retreating still farther."
"“查利！”赛克斯说着，走上前去，“你难道——难道不认识我了吗？”","“Charley!” said Sikes, stepping forward.“Don’t you—don’t you know me?”"
"“别再往我这边走了，”男孩答道，脚下仍不住地往后退。他眼露恐惧，抬头看向凶手的脸，“你这个怪物！”","“Don’t come nearer me,” answered the boy, still retreating, and looking, with horror in his eyes, upon the murderer’s face.“You monster!”"
"男人停在了半路。他们看着彼此，但是赛克斯的目光渐渐垂向了地面。","The man stopped half-way, and they looked at each other; but Sikes’s eyes sunk gradually to the ground."
"“你们三个作证，”男孩攥紧拳头，一边晃一边大声叫道，情绪也越来越激动，“你们三个作证——我不怕他——如果他们来这儿找他，我会把他交出去的，我会的。我会立刻告发你。他大可为此杀了我，如果他想这么干或是有这胆子的话。但只要我在这里，我就会把他交出去。如果他们能把他活煮了的话，我愿意把他交出去。杀人啦！救命啊！要是你们三个还带种的话，就帮我一把。杀人啦！救命啊！把他拿下！”","“Witness you three,” cried the boy shaking his clenched fist, and becoming more and more excited as he spoke.“Witness you three—I’m not afraid of him—if they come here after him, I’ll give him up; I will.I tell you out at once.He may kill me for it if he likes, or if he dares, but if I am here I’ll give him up.I’d give him up if he was to be boiled alive.Murder!Help!If there’s the pluck of a man among you three, you’ll help me.Murder!Help!Down with him!”"
"男孩一边喊，一边使劲打着手势，果真单枪匹马就朝那强壮的男人扑了上去。他用劲很猛，又出其不意，竟把赛克斯重重地摔在了地上。","Pouring out these cries, and accompanying them with violent gesticulation, the boy actually threw himself, single-handed, upon the strong man, and in the intensity of his energy and the suddenness of his surprise, brought him heavily to the ground."
"三个旁观者呆若木鸡。他们没有出手干涉，男孩和男人在地上滚作一团。男孩完全不顾拳头雨点般砸在他身上，他双手抓住凶手胸前的衣服，越攥越紧；嘴里还在声嘶力竭地求救，一声又一声，一刻都不曾停下。","The three spectators seemed quite stupefied.They offered no interference, and the boy and man rolled on the ground together; the former, heedless of the blows that showered upon him, wrenching his hands tighter and tighter in the garments about the murderer’s breast, and never ceasing to call for help with all his might."
"然而，这场比试双方实力太不对等，根本不可能进行太久。赛克斯把他扔到地上，用膝盖抵住了他的咽喉。这时，格拉基特一脸惊慌地把赛克斯拉了回来，还用手指了指窗户。下面火光闪烁，气氛热烈。人们大声谈着话，脚下走得很快，发出沉重的脚步声——听上去人数众多，数不胜数——他们正在经过离这所房子最近的那座木桥。人群中好像有个骑马的人；石子铺成的道路凹凸不平，可以听见马蹄踩在上面发出的嗒嗒声。火光越聚越多，脚步声也变得更加沉重、嘈杂。紧接着，门口传来一声巨响，有人在敲门；然后是一阵沙哑低语，像是由很多愤怒的声音汇聚而成的，即使最勇敢的人听到这儿也会胆战心惊。","The contest, however, was too unequal to last long.Sikes had him down, and his knee was on his throat, when Crackit pulled him back with a look of alarm, and pointed to the window.There were lights gleaming below, voices in loud and earnest conversation, the tramp of hurried footsteps—endless they seemed in number—crossing the nearest wooden bridge.One man on horseback seemed to be among the crowd; for there was the noise of hoofs rattling on the uneven pavement.The gleam of lights increased; the footsteps came more thickly and noisily on.Then, came a loud knocking at the door, and then a hoarse murmur from such a multitude of angry voices as would have made the boldest quail."
"“救命啊！”男孩尖叫起来，声音响彻夜空，","“Help!” shrieked the boy in a voice that rent the air."
"“他在这儿！快把门砸开！”","“He’s here!Break down the door!”"
"“以国王的名义。”屋外有人喊道，嘶哑的叫喊声也再次响起，与之前相比，声音更大了。","“In the King’s name,” cried the voices without; and the hoarse cry arose again, but louder."
"“快把门砸开！”男孩又尖叫起来，“我告诉你们，他们永远也不会开门的。直接冲进有光亮的房间。快把门砸开！”","“Break down the door!” screamed the boy.“I tell you they’ll never open it.Run straight to the room where the light is.Break down the door!”"
"他的话音刚落，门和楼下的窗板上就响起了又密又重的撞击声。人群中爆发出一阵高亢的欢呼，这让听者第一次充分认识到，呼声响亮的极致。","Strokes, thick and heavy, rattled upon the door and lower window-shutters as he ceased to speak, and a loud huzzah burst from the crowd; giving the listener, for the first time, some adequate idea of its immense extent."
"“找个地方把门打开，我要把这个大叫大嚷的小混蛋锁起来。”赛克斯满面怒容，大声喊道。他拖着男孩跑来跑去，一点儿都不显得吃力，好像他拖着的只是一个空袋子，“那扇门。快！”他把男孩往里头一掼，下了门闩，还转了下钥匙，“楼下的门牢靠吗？”","“Open the door of some place where I can lock this screeching Hell-babe,” cried Sikes fiercely; running to and fro, and dragging the boy, now, as easily as if he were an empty sack.“That door.Quick!”He flung him in, bolted it, and turned the key.“Is the downstairs door fast?”"
"“落了两道锁，还上了门链。”格拉基特回答。和其他两个人一样，他仍然是一副无能为力、一筹莫展的样子。","“Double-locked and chained,” replied Crackit, who, with the other two men, still remained quite helpless and bewildered."
"“那门板——牢固吗？”","“The panels—are they strong?”"
"“衬着铁板呢。”","“Lined with sheet-iron.”"
"“窗户也衬着？”","“And the windows too?”"
"“是的，窗户也衬着。”","“Yes, and the windows.”"
"“该死！”绝望的暴徒叫着，把窗框往上一推，冲着人群威胁道，“尽管来吧！我还要好好耍耍你们呢！”","“Damn you!” cried the desperate ruffian, throwing up the sash and menacing the crowd.“Do your worst!I’ll cheat you yet!”"
"人群被激怒了。世上所有活人听过的叫喊声中，没有哪种声音能盖过此时他们的怒吼。一些人冲着离房子最近的人呼喊，让他们放火烧了这房子；另一些人则冲警官们咆哮，要他们开枪射杀凶手。在所有人中，骑马的那人看起来最是愤怒。他飞快地跳下马鞍，像分开水流一样迅速分开人群，奔到窗子下，用盖过其他所有人的嗓门喊道：“谁搬个梯子过来，我就给谁二十几尼！”","Of all the terrific yells that ever fell on mortal ears, none could exceed the cry of the infuriated throng.Some shouted to those who were nearest to set the house on fire; others roared to the officers to shoot him dead.Among them all, none showed such fury as the man on horseback, who, throwing himself out of the saddle, and bursting through the crowd as if he were parting water, cried, beneath the window, in a voice that rose above all others, “Twenty guineas to the man who brings a ladder!”"
"离他最近的几个人也这样喊起来，接着成百上千的人也都开始有样学样。有的人叫着要梯子，有的要大锤；有的人拿着火把跑来跑去，像是在找这两样东西，可又空手返回再次呼喊起来；有的人咒骂着凶手，却是枉费唇舌、无济于事；有的人像疯子一般拼命往前挤，阻碍了楼下那些人的行动。有几个最大胆的尝试沿着落水管和墙壁的裂缝爬上去。所有人都在黑暗之中前后摇摆，像是狂风肆虐下不停晃动的一片玉米地；不时还联合起来发出一声怒吼。","The nearest voices took up the cry, and hundreds echoed it.Some called for ladders, some for sledge-hammers; some ran with torches to and fro as if to seek them, and still came back and roared again; some spent their breath in impotent curses and execrations; some pressed forward with the ecstasy of madmen, and thus impeded the progress of those below;some among the boldest attempted to climb up by the water-spout and crevices in the wall; and all waved to and fro, in the darkness beneath, like a field of corn moved by an angry wind: and joined from time to time in one loud furious roar."
"“潮水，”凶手将那些脸孔关在窗外，蹒跚地退回屋内，叫道，“我上来的时候正在涨潮。给我一根绳子，要长点的。他们全都在前面。我可以跳进荒唐沟，从那里脱身。给我一根绳子，不然我干脆再解决掉三个人，然后自杀。”","“The tide,” cried the murderer, as he staggered back into the room, and shut the faces out, “the tide was in as I came up.Give me a rope, a long rope.They’re all in front.I may drop into the Folly Ditch, and clear off that way.Give me a rope, or I shall do three more murders and kill myself.”"
"那三人被吓坏了，一齐指了指放置绳索一类物品的地方。凶手急急忙忙挑了根最长最结实的细绳，匆匆爬上了房顶。","The panic-stricken men pointed to where such articles were kept; the murderer, hastily selecting the longest and strongest cord, hurried up to the house-top."
"房子背面所有的窗户在很久以前就都被砖砌上了，只有关男孩的那个房间有一扇活动天窗。但那窗子太小了，连那孩子的小身板都没法钻过去。但就是通过这个小孔，男孩从未停止向屋外的那些人呼喊，让他们守住房子背面。当凶手最终通过屋顶的门、出现在房子的最高处时，一声大喊也随之响了起来，将这一情况宣告给身处房子前面的人们。他们立刻开始蜂拥而来，人挤人、人推人，汇成一股不间断的人流。","All the window in the rear of the house had been long ago bricked up, except one small trap in the room where the boy was locked, and that was too small even for the passage of his body.But, from this aperture, he had never ceased to call on those without, to guard the back; and thus, when the murderer emerged at last on the house-top by the door in the roof, a loud shout proclaimed the fact to those in front, who immediately began to pour round, pressing upon each other in an unbroken stream."
"凶手特意带了一块木板上去；他将木板牢牢地抵在了门上，这样的话，想从里面开门就非得花大力气不可。接着他从瓦上爬到了房子背面，越过低矮的护墙往下看。","He planted a board, which he had carried up with him for the purpose, so firmly against the door that it must be matter of great difficulty to open it from the inside; and creeping over the tiles, looked over the low parapet."
"潮水退了，荒唐沟成了一片泥床。","The water was out, and the ditch a bed of mud."
"在这几个瞬间里，人群安静了下来。人们看着他的动作，猜测着他的动机。当他们意识到他究竟想干什么时，立马知道这个图谋已经落空。人群中响起了一阵胜利的欢呼和诅咒的咆哮，和这相比，他们之前所有的叫喊都只能算是轻声耳语。嘈杂声此起彼伏。那些离得太远的人虽然不知道这是什么意思，但也跟着叫了起来。喊声一遍又一遍地回响，好像整个城市的人都涌了出来，一齐咒骂凶手。","The crowd had been hushed during these few moments, watching his motions and doubtful of his purpose, but the instant they perceived it and knew it was defeated, they raised a cry of triumphant execration to which all their previous shouting had been whispers.Again and again it rose.Those who were at too great a distance to know its meaning, took up the sound; it echoed and re-echoed; it seemed as though the whole city had poured its population out to curse him."
"有些人正对着房子走去，他们越靠越近——向前、向前、向前，愤怒的脸庞汇聚成一股激流，艰难缓慢地向前涌动；各处闪耀的火把为他们照亮了道路，也照出了他们满腔的激动和愤怒。大批民众涌入了沟渠对岸的房子；窗框被他们推了上去，甚至被完全扯破。每扇窗户边都挤满了一排又一排的脸孔；每栋房子的房顶上都附着一群又一群的人。每一座小桥（看得到的就有三座）竟都被桥上人群的重量压弯了。人流还在涌过来，都想找个角落或小孔来大喊大叫一番，更想看看那个坏人，哪怕只是一眼。","On pressed the people from the front—on, on, on, in a strong struggling current of angry faces, with here and there a glaring torch to lighten them up, and show them out in all their wrath and passion.The houses on the opposite side of the ditch had been entered by the mob; sashes were thrown up, or torn bodily out; there were tiers and tiers of faces in every window; cluster upon cluster of people clinging to every house-top.Each little bridge (and there were three in sight) bent beneath the weight of the crowd upon it.Still the current poured on to find some nook or hole from which to vent their shouts, and only for an instant see the wretch."
"“这回他们总算抓住他了。”一个人喊道，他站在离房子最近的那座桥上，“太好了！”","“They have him now,” cried a man on the nearest bridge.“Hurrah!”"
"人们心中一松，纷纷脱去帽子，叫喊声再一次响起。","The crowd grew light with uncovered heads; and again the shout uprose."
"“我出五十英镑，”同样站在那座桥上的一位老绅士喊道，“给那位活捉凶手的人。我会一直呆在这里，直到那人来找我领这笔钱。”","“I will give fifty pounds,” cried an old gentleman from the same quarter, “to the man who takes him alive.I will remain here, till he come to ask me for it.”"
"呼喊声再一次响起。这时候，人群中传出一则消息，那扇被顶住的门终于被强行打开了。第一个喊着要搬梯子的人已经登上梯子，爬进了房间。这则消息一经传开，人流立刻就变了方向。那些站在窗边的人看见桥上的人往回涌，也离开了他们原来的位置跑到街上，加入了正匆匆忙忙返回原地的大批人群。大家彼此推搡着，连连喘着粗气，急不可耐地想要靠近那扇门，只为在警官们把犯人带出来的时候看上那么一眼。有些人被挤得几乎窒息，还有些人在混乱中被挤倒在地、遭人踩踏。他们又是呼喊又是尖叫，这情形着实可怕；狭窄的道路完全堵塞了。这时候，有的人冲过来想重新占据房子前面的位置，另一些人却试图把自己从人群中解救出来，但他们的努力却是徒劳无功。集中在凶手身上的注意力立刻被分散了，尽管若还有可能，大家心中亲手捉住他的渴望是有增无减。","There was another roar.At this moment the word was passed among the crowd that the door was forced at last, and that he who had first called for the ladder had mounted into the room.The stream abruptly turned, as this intelligence ran from mouth to mouth; and the people at the windows, seeing those upon the bridges pouring back, quitted their stations, and running into the street, joined the concourse that now thronged pell-mell to the spot they had left:each man crushing and striving with his neighbor, and all panting with impatience to get near the door, and look upon the criminal as the officers brought him out.The cries and shrieks of those who were pressed almost to suffocation, or trampled down and trodden under foot in the confusion, were dreadful; the narrow ways were completely blocked up;and at this time, between the rush of some to regain the space in front of the house, and the unavailing struggles of others to extricate themselves from the mass, the immediate attention was distracted from the murderer, although the universal eagerness for his capture was, if possible, increased"
"男人畏缩不前，人群的凶暴和逃跑的无望把他完全压垮了。尽管如此，他还是立刻就发现发现了人群的突然变化。他跳了起来，决定为自己的生命作最后一搏，那就是跳入沟渠，冒着窒息的危险，趁着夜色的掩护和周围的混乱偷偷离开。","The man had shrunk down, thoroughly quelled by the ferocity of the crowd, and the impossibility of escape; but seeing this sudden change with no less rapidity than it had occurred, he sprang upon his feet, determined to make one last effort for his life by dropping into the ditch, and, at the risk of being stifled, endeavouring to creep away in the darkness and confusion."
"作完这个决定，他力量顿生，干劲也足了。此时，屋内传出了喧闹声，说明确实有人已经进了房子，这让他大受刺激。他用一只脚抵住烟囱筒，把绳子一端绕着烟囱结结实实栓住，然后在手齿并用，几乎在一瞬间就用绳子的另一端做好了一个坚固的活套。他可以顺着细绳滑到距地面不到自己身高的地方，到时候再用手里的小刀割断绳子，把自己放下去。","Roused into new strength and energy, and stimulated by the noise within the house which announced that an entrance had really been effected, he set his foot against the stack of chimneys, fastened one end of the rope tightly and firmly round it, and with the other made a strong running noose by the aid of his hands and teeth almost in a second.He could let himself down by the cord to within a less distance of the ground than his own height, and had his knife ready in his hand to cut it then and drop."
"就在他把活结套在自己头上，马上要让绳结滑到腋窝下的时候，之前提到的那位老绅士（他紧紧贴在桥栏杆上来抵挡人群的推力，保住自己的立足之地）急切地警告周围的人们，那男人要把自己放下来——就在此刻，凶手在房顶回头看了一眼，突然把双手举过头顶，发出了一声令人心胆俱裂的叫喊。","At the very instant when he brought the loop over his head previous to slipping it beneath his arm-pits, and when the old gentleman before-mentioned (who had clung so tight to the railing of the bridge as to resist the force of the crowd,and retain his position) earnestly warned those about him that the man was about to lower himself down—at that very instant the murderer, looking behind him on the roof, threw his arms above his head, and uttered a yell of terror."
"“又是那双眼睛！”他诡异地尖叫了一声。","“The eyes again!” he cried in an unearthly screech."
"他好像被闪电击中了一般，身体失去了平衡，晃了两晃后从护墙上跌落了下来。他脖子上还套着活套。绳子被他的重量一拉，迅速绷得像弓弦一样紧，拉直的速度更是像箭一样快。他往下落了整整三十五英尺。他被绳子猛地一拉，四肢可怕地抽动了一下。人被吊在那里，手已经变硬了，手心里还紧紧握着一把打开的小刀。","Staggering as if struck by lightning, he lost his balance and tumbled over the parapet.The noose was on his neck.It ran up with his weight, tight as a bow-string, and swift as the arrow it speeds.He fell for five-and-thirty feet.There was a sudden jerk, a terrific convulsion of the limbs; and there he hung, with the open knife clenched in his stiffening hand."
"老烟囱受了这次冲击，颤了一颤，但还是英勇地挺了过来。杀人犯像一块死肉一般，面对着墙壁荡来荡去，挡住了男孩的视线。男孩把摇摇晃晃的尸体使劲推到一边，请求人们看在上帝的份上，过去把他从那儿弄出来。","The old chimney quivered with the shock, but stood it bravely.The murderer swung lifeless against the wall; and the boy, thrusting aside the dangling body which obscured his view, called to the people to come and take him out, for God’s sake."
"一条狗凄凉地嚎叫起来，这条狗之前一直潜藏着没露面。它在胸墙上前前后后地跑，等蓄好势，就朝着死者肩膀跳了过去。可惜它偏离了目标，一头栽进了沟渠。往下落的时候，它还完全翻了个身，头直直地撞在一块石头上，脑浆撒了一地。","A dog, which had lain concealed till now, ran backwards and forwards on the parapet with a dismal howl, and collecting himself for a spring, jumped for the dead man’s shoulders.Missing his aim, he fell into the ditch, turning completely over as he went; and striking his head against a stone, dashed out his brains."
"第五十一章 本章将为若干谜团解开谜底，并讲述一桩没有承诺亦没有彩礼的婚事","CHAPTER LI Affording an explanation of more mysteries than one, and comprehending a proposal of marriage with no word of settlement or pin-money "
"上一章讲述的事件仅仅才过去两天。那天下午三点，一辆旅行马车朝着奥利弗出生的那个镇子飞驰而去，奥利弗自己正坐在车里。与他同行的有梅莱夫人、罗丝、贝德温夫人和那位好心的医生。布朗洛先生则和另一位不知姓名的人士乘坐一辆驿站马车紧随其后。","The events narrated in the last chapter were yet but two days old, when Oliver found himself, at three o’clock in the afternoon, in a travelling-carriage rolling fast towards his native town.Mrs. Maylie, and Rose, and Mrs. Bedwin, and the good doctor were with him: and Mr. Brownlow followed in a post-chaise, accompanied by one other person whose name had not been mentioned."
"一路上，他们交谈甚少。奥利弗心情激荡，又因前路难卜而焦躁不安；他无法捋清自己的思绪，几乎连话都说不出。同行的几个人受到的影响似乎也不亚于他下。蒙克斯被迫供认，布朗洛先生谨慎小心地将他供出的实情告诉了奥利弗和两位夫人。尽管大家知道此行的目的是让本已顺利开始的工作圆满收尾，但整件事情仍然扑朔迷离，他们心中一直感到焦虑万分。","They had not talked much upon the way; for Oliver was in a flutter of agitation and uncertainty which deprived him of the power of collecting his thoughts, and almost of speech, and appeared to have scarcely less effect on his companions, who shared it, in at least an equal degree.He and the two ladies had been very carefully made acquainted by Mr. Brownlow with the nature of the admissions which had been forced from Monks; and although they knew that the object of their present journey was to complete the work which had been so well begun, still the whole matter was enveloped in enough of doubt and mystery to leave them in endurance of the most intense suspense."
"在罗斯伯力先生的帮助下，又是那位善良的朋友考虑周全。他小心地切断了所有消息的来源渠道，使他们无法了解最近发生的一桩桩可怕的事情。“不错，”他说，“要不了多久他们就会知道的，但是，早知道不如晚知道，反正再糟糕也不过如此了。”于是，一路上谁都没有说话，一行人都在琢磨着那件将他们聚到一起的事情，但没有一个人愿意打破沉默，把困扰所有人的想法说出来。","The same kind friend had, with Mr. Losberne’s assistance, cautiously stopped all channels of communication through which they could receive intelligence of the dreadful occurrences that so recently taken place.“It was quite true,” he said, “that they must know them before long, but it might be at a better time than the present, and it could not be at a worse.”So, they travelled on in silence: each busied with reflections on the object which had brought them together: and no one disposed to give utterance to the thoughts which crowded upon all."
"奥利弗思绪万千，他正沿着一条之前从未见过的大道，一点一点地靠近他的出生地，如果说此时他仍能保持沉默，那么等他们的马车转进了那条他曾徒步走过的路，那条见证了他曾是个可怜巴巴、无友可依、无片瓦遮头的流浪儿的路时，又会有多少往事涌入他的心头，唤醒他胸中多少复杂的感情。","But if Oliver, under these influences, had remained silent while they journeyed towards his birth-place by a road he had never seen, how the whole current of his recollections ran back to old times, and what a crowd of emotions were wakened up in his breast, when they turned into that which he had traversed on foot: a poor houseless, wandering boy, without a friend to help him, or a roof to shelter his head."
"“瞧那儿，那儿！”奥利弗急切地抓住罗丝的手，指着车窗外喊道，“我爬过那个栅栏，然后从那些篱笆后面溜走，当时就怕有人会抓住我，把我押回去！远处那条小路穿过田野，通向我小时候住过的老房子。哦，迪克，迪克，我亲爱的老朋友，真想现在就见到你！”","“See there, there!” cried Oliver, eagerly clasping the hand of Rose, and pointing out at the carriage window; “that’s the stile I came over; there are the hedges I crept behind, for fear any one should overtake me and force me back!Yonder is the path across the fields, leading to the old house where I was a little child! oh Dick, Dick, my dear old friend, if I could only see you now!”"
"“你会很快见到他的。”罗丝温柔地握着他交叉在一起的双手，答道，“你还可以告诉他，你现在有多开心、多富有。尽管你拥有了所有这一切，但对你来说最大的幸福，还是回到这里让他也获得幸福。”","“You will see him soon,” replied Rose, gently taking his folded hands between her own.“You shall tell him how happy you are, and how rich you have grown, and that in all your happiness you have none so great as the coming back to make him happy too.”"
"“是呀，是呀，”奥利弗说道，“我们要——我们要把他从这里带走，给他穿新衣，教他念书，还要把他送到安静的乡下，这样他就能快快长大了——对吗？”","“Yes, yes,” said Oliver, “and we’ll—we’ll take him away from here, and have him clothed and taught, and send him to some quiet country place where he may grow strong and well,—shall we?”"
"罗丝唯有点点头。看着这孩子一边微笑一边流着幸福的泪水，她一时说不出话来。","Rose nodded “yes,” for the boy was smiling through such happy tears that she could not speak."
"“你一定会对他非常好的，因为你对每个人都一样好。”奥利弗说，“我知道，听过他的故事，你会大哭一场。但是不要紧，不要紧的，一切都会结束的；你也会再次微笑的——这我也知道——当你想到他的变化时。你对我就是这样的。我逃走的时候，他对我说‘愿上帝保佑你’。”奥利弗难以自已，失声痛哭，“现在，该我对他说‘愿上帝保佑你’了；我要让他知道，因为这句话，我有多么爱他。”","“You will be kind and good to him, for you are to every one,” said Oliver.“It will make you cry, I know, to hear what he can tell; but never mind, never mind, it will be all over, and you will smile again—I know that too—to think how changed he is; you did the same with me.He said ‘God bless you’to me when I ran away,” cried the boy with a burst of affectionate emotion; “and I will say ‘God bless you’ now, and show him how I love him for it!”"
"他们离镇子越来越近。最后，他们的马车终于进了镇，穿行在一条条狭窄的街道中。此时让奥利弗克制自己、保持理性，实在不是件容易事。苏尔伯雷的棺材铺还和原来一样，只是比奥利弗印象中的小了一些，而且也没那么富丽堂皇了；店铺和房子看上去都很眼熟，他几乎和每家都曾有过些联系；那是甘菲尔德的马车，那辆他曾用过的马车，就停在那家老字号的客栈门口——那是济贫院，他童年时代可怕的牢笼，它那阴郁的窗户总是怨念地望着街道——站在门口的还是那个瘦弱的看门人，看到他，奥利弗便不由自主地往后一缩，他随即又笑自己如此愚蠢，然后又哭，接着又笑。门口处，窗户旁，有很多他熟悉的面孔；这里几乎人事依旧，仿佛他只不过昨天才离开，而他近来的整个生活只是一场美梦罢了。","As they approached the town, and at length drove through its narrow streets, it became matter of no small difficulty to restrain the boy within reasonable bounds.There was Sowerberry’s the undertaker’s just as it used to be, only smaller and less imposing in appearance than he remembered it—there were all the well-known shops and houses, with almost every one of which he had some slight incident connected—there was Gamfield’s cart,the very cart he used to have, standing at the old public-house door—there was the workhouse, the dreary prison of his youthful days, with its dismal windows frowning on the street—there was the same lean porter standing at the gate, at sight of whom Oliver involuntarily shrunk back,and then laughed at himself for being so foolish, then cried, then laughed again—there were scores of faces at the doors and windows that he knew quite well—there was nearly everything as if he had left it but yesterday, and all his recent life had been but a happy dream."
"然而，现实是真实的、纯粹的，不掺一丝虚假而又令人愉悦的。马车径直驶向镇上最豪华的那家饭店（奥利弗曾怀着敬畏的心情瞻仰过这家饭店，觉得它简直就是一座气势恢弘的宫殿，可现在不知怎的，它失去了昔日的雄伟之姿）格林维格先生已经做好了一切准备，正站在门口恭候他们的到来。等他们下了车，他亲了亲年轻的小姐，又亲了亲年长的夫人，仿佛他是所有人的祖父，那样笑容满面、和蔼可亲。不过他没有提到吃掉自己的脑袋——没错，一次也没提到，甚至在和一位老邮差争论去伦敦哪条路最近的时候，他都没提起。他坚称自己最清楚哪条路最近，尽管那条路他只走过一次，且在路上睡得人事不省。晚餐、卧室都已备好，一切都安排得妥妥当当，仿佛被施了魔法一般神奇。","But it was pure, earnest, joyful reality.They drove straight to the door of the chief hotel (which Oliver used to stare up at, with awe, and think a mighty palace, but which had somehow fallen off in grandeur and size);and here was Mr. Grimwig all ready to receive them, kissing the young lady, and the old one too, when they got out of the coach, as if he were the grandfather of the whole party, all smiles and kindness, and not offering to eat his head—no, not once;not even when he contradicted a very old postboy about the nearest road to London, and maintained he knew it best, though he had only come that way once, and that time fast asleep.There was dinner prepared, and there were bedrooms ready, and everything was arranged as if by magic."
"尽管如此，当最初忙乱的半个小时过后，之前那种沉默、压抑的气氛再次蔓延开来。这一路走来，这种气氛已经使得他们这行人陷于低潮。布朗洛先生没有和他们共进晚餐，他一直呆在一间单独的房间里。其他两位绅士则神情焦虑，进出匆忙。就算中间短暂地回来过几次，他们也只是在一旁交流谈话。中间有一次，梅莱夫人被叫走了。她大约一个小时以后才回来，眼睛竟然都哭肿了。罗丝和奥利弗对最新的情况一无所知，而所有这些事情更是让他们神经紧绷、如坐针毡。他们坐着发愣，沉默不语；即使偶尔交谈几句，也都是低声耳语，好像连听见自己的声音也觉得害怕一般。","Notwithstanding all this, when the hurry of the first half-hour was over, the same silence and constraint prevailed that had marked their journey down.Mr. Brownlow did not join them at dinner, but remained in a separate room.The two other gentlemen hurried in and out with anxious faces, and, during the short intervals when they were present, conversed apart.Once, Mrs. Maylie was called away, and after being absent for nearly an hour, returned with eyes swollen with weeping.All these things made Rose and Oliver, who were not in any new secrets, nervous and uncomfortable.They sat wondering, in silence; or, if they exchanged a few words, spoke in whispers, as if they were afraid to hear the sound of their own voices."
"终于到了九点钟。他们本以为今晚不会再听到什么新的消息了，可就在这时，罗斯伯力先生和格林维格先生走进了房间，后面跟着布朗洛先生和另一个男人。看到此人，奥利弗大吃一惊，差点叫了出来。他们告诉他，这是他的哥哥。此人曾在集市上见过他一面，还曾同费金一道，在他的小屋窗口外探头探脑。蒙克斯恶狠狠地瞪了一眼尚未从惊讶中恢复的奥利弗，在门边坐了下来。事到如今，他还是无法掩饰自己的仇恨。布朗洛先生拿着几份文件，走到一张桌子跟前；罗丝和奥利弗就坐这张桌子旁。","At length, when nine o’clock had come, and they began to think they were to hear no more that night, Mr. Losberne and Mr. Grimwig entered the room, followed by Mr. Brownlow and a man whom Oliver almost shrieked with surprise to see;for they told him it was his brother, and it was the same man he had met at the market-town, and seen looking in with Fagin at the window of his little room.Monks cast a look of hate, which, even then, he could not dissemble, at the astonished boy, and sat down near the door.Mr. Brownlow, who had papers in his hand, walked to a table near which Rose and Oliver were seated."
"“这是份苦差事。”他说道，“这些声明已经在伦敦当着许多绅士的面签署过了，但我认为在这里简明扼要地重新宣读一遍，很有必要。我本不想让你难堪，但是在大家分开前，我还是需要听你亲口再念一遍，原因你是知道的。”","“This is a painful task,” said he, “but these declarations, which have been signed in London before many gentlemen, must be in substance repeated here.I would have spared you the degradation, but we must hear them from your own lips before we part, and you know why.”"
"“说下去，”发言人把脸转到一边，说道，“快点。我觉得我也做得够多了。别再难为我了。”","“Go on,” said the person addressed, turning away his face.“Quick.I have almost done enough, I think.Don’t keep me here.”"
"“这个孩子，”布朗洛先生把奥利弗拉到身旁，把一只手放在他的头上，说道，“是你同父异母的兄弟，是你父亲、我的好友埃德温·黎福特的非婚生子。他的母亲，那可怜的小阿格尼丝·弗莱明，在生他的时候难产死了。”","“This child,” said Mr. Brownlow, drawing Oliver to him, and laying his hand upon his head, “is your half-brother; the illegitimate son of your father, my dear friend Edwin Leeford, by poor young Agnes Fleming, who died in giving him birth.”"
"“是啊，”蒙克斯一脸怒容，瞪着那个浑身颤抖的男孩，或许还能听到对方砰砰的心跳声，“他就是个私生子。”","“Yes,” said Monks, scowling at the trembling boy: the beating of whose heart he might have heard.“That is the bastard child.”"
"“你用这个字眼，”布朗洛先生厉声喝道，“想要侮辱的那些人早已超脱于世间种种流言蜚语之外。你用这个字眼非但不会败坏任何生者的名誉，反倒会让你自取其辱。不说这些了。他是在这个镇上出生的。”","“The term you use,” said Mr. Brownlow, sternly, “is a reproach to those long since passed beyond the feeble censure of the world.It reflects disgrace on no one living, except you who use it.Let that pass.He was born in this town.”"
"“在本镇的救济院里。”蒙克斯回道，口气甚是阴沉，“你那儿不是写着整件事嘛。”他一边说，一边不耐烦地指了指那些文件。","“In the workhouse of this town,” was the sullen reply.“You have the story there.”He pointed impatiently to the papers as he spoke."
"“我要在这里证实一下。”布朗洛先生说道，环顾了一下四周的听众。","“I must have it here, too,” said Mr. Brownlow, looking round upon the listeners."
"“那就听着！你们！”蒙克斯回道，","“Listen then!You!” returned Monks."
"“他的父亲在罗马病倒了。他父亲的妻子，也就是我母亲，带着我从巴黎赶往罗马——去料理他的财产。他们分居已久，而且据我所知，他们之间没什么感情。他根本不知道我们去了那里。当时他毫无知觉，一直昏迷不醒，到了第二天，他就死了。他书桌上的文件里，有两封写于他刚发病那晚，上面指明要直接寄给你本人。”他对布朗洛先生说，“里面有他给你写的几句话，文件封皮上还附有一则说明，即要等他死后才能寄出。文件中还夹了一封信，就是写给这个叫阿格尼丝的姑娘的，另一封就是遗嘱。”","“His father being taken ill at Rome, was joined by his wife, my mother, from whom he had been long separated, who went from Paris and took me with her—to look after his property, for what I know, for she had no great affection for him, nor he for her.He knew nothing of us, for his senses were gone, and he slumbered on till next day, when he died.Among the papers in his desk, were two, dated on the night his illness first came on, directed to yourself”; he addressed himself to Mr. Brownlow; “and enclosed in a few short lines to you, with an intimation on the cover of the package that it was not to be forwarded till after he was dead.One of these papers was a letter to this girl Agnes; the other a will.”"
"“那封信上写了什么？”布朗洛先生问道。","“What of the letter?” asked Mr. Brownlow."
"“那封信？不过就是一张纸，上面尽是涂涂改改的痕迹。纸上写着他的忏悔、坦白，还有祈求上帝帮助她的祷告。他扯了个谎，骗她说因为某个难以说清的秘密——他终有一日会向她解释的——他那时没法娶她。她一如既往地相信了他，但信任得过了头，失去了任何人都无法给她再找回来的东西。那个时候，她还有几个月就要生了。他把自己的打算都告诉了她：如果他活着，会保护她的名誉；如果他死了，恳请她不要诅咒他的亡灵，或认为他们的罪恶会给她或他们年幼的孩子招致惩罚，因为他才是罪魁祸首。他提醒她，他曾送给她一个能藏东西的项链坠和一枚刻有她基督教名的戒指，并希望有朝一日在名字旁边的空白处能刻上随他的姓氏——他恳请她保存好戒指，像从前一样，把它挂在胸前——然后他失控了，一遍又一遍疯狂地写着同样的话，好像神经错乱了一样。他当时肯定是神经错乱了。”","“The letter?—A sheet of paper crossed and crossed again, with a penitent confession, and prayers to God to help her.He had palmed a tale on the girl that some secret mystery—to be explained one day—prevented his marrying her just then; and so she had gone on, trusting patiently to him, until she trusted too far, and lost what none could ever give her back.She was, at that time, within a few months of her confinement.He told her all he had meant to do, to hide her shame, if he had lived, and prayed her, if he died, not to curse his memory, or think the consequences of their sin would be visited on her or their young child; for all the guilt was his.He reminded her of the day he had given her the little locket and the ring with her christian name engraved upon it, and a blank left for that which he hoped one day to have bestowed upon her—prayed her yet to keep it, and wear it next her heart, as she had done before—and then ran on, wildly, in the same words, over and over again, as if he had gone distracted.I believe he had.”"
"“说说那遗嘱。”布朗洛先生说道。此时，奥利弗已泪如雨下。蒙克斯默不作声。","“The will,” said Mr. Brownlow, as Oliver’s tears fell fast. Monks was silent."
"“那份遗嘱，”布朗洛先生替他说道，“和那封信差不多。他谈到他妻子带给他的痛苦，还谈到你的反叛性情、恶劣行径、为人不善以及过早形成的阴毒。你是他唯一的儿子，却受人教唆，对他心怀仇恨。他给你和你母亲各留了八百磅的年金。他将自己大部分的财产平均分为两份，一份给阿格尼丝·弗莱明，另一份留给他们的孩子；只要孩子能生下来，并达到法定年龄。如果孩子是女孩，那么她将无条件继承遗产；如果是男孩，那他只有满足下列条件，才可继承遗产：在其未成年期间，不能以任何有损名誉、卑鄙、怯懦或违法的行为玷污他的姓氏。他说，这么做是为了表明他对孩子母亲的信任，以及他的信念——越是临近死亡，这种信念越是坚定——他坚信，他们的孩子会继承母亲的温柔心肠、高贵品质。如果他的希望落了空，那么那部分遗产则全部归你。只有到了那个时候，只有当两个孩子同为一丘之貉时，他才承认你有优先继承权。你从小就以冷漠与憎恨打击你的父亲，因而你不得他的欢心。”","“The will,” said Mr. Brownlow, speaking for him, “was in the same spirit as the letter.He talked of miseries which his wife had brought upon him; of the rebellious disposition, vice, malice, and premature bad passions of you his only son, who had been trained to hate him; and left you, and your mother, each an annuity of eight hundred pounds.The bulk of his property he divided into two equal portions—one for Agnes Fleming, and the other for their child, if it should be born alive, and ever come of age.If it were a girl, it was to inherit the money unconditionally; but if a boy, only on the stipulation that in his minority he should never have stained his name with any public act of dishonour, meanness, cowardice, or wrong.He did this, he said, to mark his confidence in the other, and his conviction—only strengthened by approaching death—that the child would share her gentle heart, and noble nature.If he were disappointed in this expectation, then the money was to come to you: for then, and not till then, when both children were equal, would he recognise your prior claim upon his purse, who had none upon his heart, but had, from an infant, repulsed him with coldness and aversion.”"
"“我的母亲，”蒙克斯提高了嗓音，说道，“我的母亲做了一个女人应该做的事情。她把遗嘱烧了。那封信永远到不了收信人手里，但她把那封信和其他的证据一并留了下来，以防那些人想要掩盖自己不光彩的行为。那姑娘的父亲从她那里得知了真相，出于刻骨的仇恨——我真爱她这点——她还添油加醋，极力抹黑。他羞愧难当，自觉名誉尽损，带着孩子们逃到了威尔士的一个偏远角落。他还改名换姓，让朋友们找不到他隐退的地方。到那里没多久，他就被人发现死在了床上。几周前，那个女孩悄悄离家出走；他为了找她，徒步走遍附近的每个镇子，每一个村庄。他死的那天晚上，刚回到家，认定女儿为了掩盖自己的丑事，为了不使自己的父亲蒙羞，结束了自己的生命。一想到这里，他那颗年老的心都碎了。”","“My mother,” said Monks, in a louder tone, “did what a woman should have done.She burnt this will.The letter never reached its destination; but that, and other proofs, she kept, in case they ever tried to lie away the blot.The girl’s father had the truth from her with every aggravation that her violent hate—I love her for it now—could add.Goaded by shame and dishonour he fled with his children into a remote corner of Wales, changing his very name that his friends might never know of his retreat; and here, no great while afterwards, he was found dead in his bed.The girl had left her home, in secret, some weeks before; he had searched for her, on foot, in every town and village near; it was on the night when he returned home, assured that she had destroyed herself, to hide her shame and his, that his old heart broke.”"
"房间里鸦雀无声。片刻过后，布朗洛先生接过话头，继续讲了下去，","There was a short silence here, until Mr. Brownlow took up the thread of the narrative."
"“几年后，”他说，“这个男人——爱德华·黎福特——他的母亲来找我。他十八岁的时候就离开了她，还卷走了她的首饰钱财。他滥赌成瘾、挥霍无度、造假欺诈，最后逃到了伦敦,在那里和社会底层的无法无天之徒混了两年。她深受一种不治之症的折磨，痛苦不堪，身体每况愈下。她希望能在自己死前，把儿子找回来。她四处打听调查，不放过一处地方。有很长一段时间，所有的努力都毫无成果，但最终还是让她找着了他。他便跟着她回了法国。”","“Years after this,” he said, “this man’s—Edward Leeford’s—mother came to me.He had left her, when only eighteen; robbed her of jewels and money; gambled, squandered, forged, and fled to London: where for two years he had associated with the lowest outcasts.She was sinking under a painful and incurable disease, and wished to recover him before she died.Inquiries were set on foot, and strict searches made.They were unavailing for a long time, but ultimately successful; and he went back with her to France.”"
"“她死在了那里。”蒙克斯说道，“她的病一点一点吞噬了她。临终前，她将这些秘密，连同她对牵涉其中的每个人那永远无法压制的刻骨仇恨一起传给了我——尽管她没必要这么做，因为我早已继承了这份仇恨。她不相信那个姑娘自杀了，不相信她的孩子也死了。她总觉得那姑娘生了个男孩，那个男孩还好好地活在这个世上。我向她发誓，如果我遇到了那个家伙，一定不会让他有片刻安宁，甚至要把他置于死地；我要把我刻骨的仇恨都发泄到他的头上，我会狠狠地收拾他，让他体会到无休无止的憎恶；如果可以，我还要把他拖到绞刑架下，以此来向那张满纸空话的辱人遗嘱吐口水。她没说错。我最终还是遇到了他。开头很顺利，要不是那些满口胡话的婊子，我早就得手了！”","“There she died,” said Monks, “after a lingering illness; and, on her death-bed, she bequeathed these secrets to me, together with her unquenchable and deadly hatred of all whom they involved—though she need not have left me that, for I had inherited it long before.She would not believe that the girl had destroyed herself, and the child too, but was filled with the impression that a male child had been born, and was alive.I swore to her, if ever it crossed my path, to hunt it down; never to let it rest; to pursue it with the bitterest and most unrelenting animosity; to vent upon it the hatred that I deeply felt, and to spit upon the empty vaunt of that insulting will by draggin it, if I could, to the very gallows-foot.She was right.He came in my way at last.I began well; and, but for babbling drabs, I would have finished as I began!”"
"这恶棍将双臂紧紧地交叉在胸前，怀着无处发泄的怨恨喃喃自语，咒骂自己无能。在场的每个人都听得毛骨悚然，布朗洛先生转过身来，向他们解释说，那个犹太人与他合作了很久，既是他的帮凶也是心腹。他诱惑奥利弗上钩，得到一大笔酬金。不过如果奥利弗得救了，他还得退还部分酬金。他们在这个问题上起了争执，才会前往乡村别墅，目的就是为了确认，那孩子的确是奥利弗。","As the villain folded his arms tight together, and muttered curses on himself in the impotence of baffled malice, Mr. Brownlow turned to the terrified group beside him, and explained that the Jew, who had been his old accomplice and confidant, had a large reward for keeping Oliver ensnared:of which some part was to be given up, in the event of his being rescued: and that a dispute on this head had led to their visit to the country house for the purpose of identifying him."
"“那个项链坠和戒指呢？”布朗洛转头问蒙克斯。","“The locket and ring?” said Mr. Brownlow, turning to Monks."
"“我曾跟你提起过一对男女。那两样东西我就是从他们手上买来的，他们是从看护偷来的，看护又是从死人身上扒拉下来的。”蒙克斯答道，连眼皮都没抬一下，“剩下的事情，你都知道了。”","“I bought them from the man and woman I told you of, who stole them from the nurse, who stole them from the corpse,” answered Monks without raising his eyes.“You know what became of them.”"
"布朗洛先生只是朝格林维格先生点了点头，后者欣然离开。他很快又回来了，前面推着邦布尔夫人，后面还拽着她很不情愿的丈夫。","Mr. Brownlow merely nodded to Mr. Grimwig, who disappearing with great alacrity, shortly returned, pushing in Mrs. Bumble, and dragging her unwilling consort after him."
"“我不是眼花了吧！”邦布尔先生热情地大叫起来，一副惺惺作态的嘴脸，“这不是奥利弗吗？哦，奥——利——弗，你都不知道我为了你有多么伤心——”“住嘴，蠢货！”邦布尔夫人嘟囔着。","“Do my hi’s deceive me!” cried Mr. Bumble, with ill-feigned enthusiasm, “or is that little Oliver?Oh O-li-ver, if you know’d how I’ve  been a-grieving for you—” “Hold your tongue, fool,” murmured Mrs. Bumble."
"“这难道不是人之常情——人之常情吗，邦布尔夫人？”济贫院院长反驳道，","“Isn’t natur, natur, Mrs. Bumble?”remonstrated the workhouse master."
"“我就不能有所感触——是我代表教区把他抚养大的——现在看到他和这些亲切友善的先生女士们在一起，我就不能有所感触吗！我一直很爱这孩子，就像他是我的——我的——我的亲爷爷一样。”邦布尔先生顿了一下，才找到了这样一个恰当的比方，“亲爱的奥利弗少爷，您记不记得那位好命的白背心绅士？唉！他上礼拜回到上帝的怀抱去了，用了一口橡木棺材，连把手都是镀金的，奥利弗。”","“Can’t I be supposed to feel—I as brought him up porochially—when I see him a-setting here among ladies and gentlemen of the very affablest description!I always loved that boy as if he’d been my—my—my own grandfather,” said Mr. Bumble, halting for an appropriate comparison.“Master Oliver, my dear, you remember the blessed gentleman in the white waistcoat?Ah! he went to heaven last week, in a oak coffin with plated handles, Oliver.”"
"“省省吧，老兄，”格林维格先生讽刺地说道，“控制一下自己的情绪。”","“Come, sir,” said Mr. Grimwig, tartly; “suppress your feelings.”"
"“我尽量，先生。”邦布尔先生答道，“您近来可好，先生？愿您身体安康。”","“I will do my endeavours, sir,” replied Mr. Bumble.“How do you do, sir?I hope you are very well.”"
"这一番话是问候布朗洛先生的。他正朝着这对可敬的夫妇走来，此时已经离他们很近了。他指着蒙克斯，问道：“你认识那人吗？”","This salutation was addressed to Mr. Brownlow, who had stepped up to within a short distance of the respectable couple.He inquired, as he pointed to Monks, “Do you know that person?”"
"“不认识。”邦布尔夫人断然否认。","“No,” replied Mrs. Bumble flatly."
"“恐怕——你——也不认识吧？”布朗洛先生转而问她的配偶。","“Perhaps—you—don’t?” said Mr. Brownlow, addressing her spouse."
"“我这辈子从没见过他。”邦布尔先生说。","“I never saw him in all my life,” said Mr. Bumble."
"“或许，也没卖过他什么东西吗？”","“Nor sold him anything, perhaps?”"
"“没有。”邦布尔夫人答道。","“No,” replied Mrs. Bumble."
"“或许，你们也从未有过一个项链坠和一枚金戒指吧？”布朗洛先生说道。","“You never had, perhaps, a certain gold locket and ring?” said Mr.Brownlow."
"“当然没有，”女管家答道，“你干嘛把我们带这儿来，还让我们回答这样毫无意义的问题？”","“Certainly not,” replied the matron.“Why are we brought here to answer to such nonsense as this?”"
"布朗洛先生再次向格林维格先生点了点头，那位绅士又一瘸一拐地离开了房间，看得出来他非常乐意干这件事。不过这次他带回来的，不是一对身强体壮的夫妇，而是两位全身瘫软的女人。她们摇摇晃晃地走进了房间，浑身哆嗦个不停。","Again Mr. Brownlow nodded to Mr. Grimwig; and again that gentleman limped away with extraordinary readiness.But not again did he return with a stout man and wife; for this time, he led in two palsied women, who shook and tottered as they walked."
"“老萨利死的那个晚上，你关上了门，”走在前面的一个抬起一只满是皱纹的手，说道，“但你关不住声响，也堵不住门缝。”","“You shut the door the night old Sally died,” said the foremost one, raising her shrivelled hand, “but you couldn’t shut out the sound, nor stop the chinks.”"
"“你办不到，办不到，”另一个望了望四周，摇了摇没有牙齿的嘴巴，“办不到，办不到，办不到。”","“No, no,” said the other, looking round her and wagging her toothless jaws.“No, no, no.”"
"“我们俩听见她想把做过的事情告诉你，还瞧见你从她手里拿走了一张纸。第二天我们盯着你，看见你去了当铺。”头一个说。“没错，”第二个女人补充道，“那是个项链坠和一枚金戒指。”“我们认出了那些东西，还眼见那些东西被交给了你。我们当时就在旁边。哦！我们就在旁边。”","“We heard her try to tell you what she’d done, and saw you take a paper from her hand, and watched you too, next day, to the pawnbroker’s shop,” said the first. “Yes,” added the second, “and it was a locket and gold ring.”“We found out that, and saw it given you.We were by.Oh! we were by.”"
"“我们可知道的可不光是这点事。”第一个女人接着说，“很久以前，她就经常向我们提起，那位年轻母亲觉得自己快撑不住了时，曾经对她讲过，她那时正在赶路，想要死在孩子父亲的坟前，不想自己却病倒在了半路。”","“And we know more than that,” resumed the first, “for she told us often, long ago, that the young mother had told her that, feeling she should never get over it, she was on her way, at the time that she was taken ill, to die near the grave of the father of the child.”"
"“你还想见见当铺老板本人吗？”格林维格先生做了个朝门口走的动作，问道。","“Would you like to see the pawnbroker himself?” asked Mr.Grimwig with a motion towards the door."
"“不想，”那女人答道，“如果他——”她指了指蒙克斯，“他这个懦夫都招了的话，依我所见他肯定已经这么干了；你又向这里所有的老太婆打听过，最后还真给你找对了证人，那我也没什么好否认的了。我的确卖过那两件东西，可你们也永远找不到那些东西了。你们还能拿我怎么着？”","“No,” replied the woman; “ if he—she pointed to Monks—”has been coward enough to confess, as I see he has, and you have sounded all these hags till you have found the right ones, I have nothing more to say.I—did—sell them, and they’re where you’ll never get them.What then?”"
"“不怎么着，”布朗洛先生答道，“只不过我们注意到，你们两人都不值得信任，不能再担当职务了。你们可以走了。”","“Nothing,” replied Mr. Brownlow, “except that it remains for us to take care that neither of you is employed in a situation of trust again.You may leave the room.”"
"“我希望，”格林维格先生带着两个老妇人出去后，邦布尔先生看了看左右，满脸悔恨地说，“我希望，不要因为这丁点儿不愉快的事情，就撤掉我的教区公职，好吗？”","“I hope,” said Mr. Bumble, looking about him with great ruefulness, as Mr. Grimwig disappeared with the two old women: “I hope that this unfortunate little circumstance will not deprive me of my porochial office?”"
"“撤职是免不了的，”布朗洛先生答道，“你还是知足吧，你们已经很走运了。”","“Indeed it will,” replied Mr. Brownlow.“You may make up your mind to that, and think yourself well off besides.”"
"“这都是邦布尔夫人干的。她——非要——这么做。”邦布尔先生先四下里看了看，确定他的配偶已经离开了房间，这才连声解释道。","“It was all Mrs. Bumble.She—would—do it,” urged Mr. Bumble; first looking round to ascertain that his partner had left the room."
"“这不是借口。”布朗洛先生回应道，“销毁这些首饰的时候你在场，而且从法律的角度看，你的罪责更为严重，因为依照法律推断，你妻子的所作所为是受你指使的。”","“That is no excuse,” replied Mr. Brownlow.“You were present on the occasion of the destruction of these trinkets, and indeed are the more guilty of the two, in the eye of the law; for the law supposes that your wife acts under your direction.”"
"“如果法律这样推断，”邦布尔先生双手夹着帽子，使劲地往中间挤，说道，“那法律就是个蠢货——还是个白痴。如果这就是法律的角度，那么法律一定是个单身汉。我期望法律落到最糟糕的境遇，就是通过亲身体验，开眼明白真相——通过亲身体验。”","“If the law supposes that,” said Mr. Bumble, squeezing his hat emphatically in both hands, “the law is a ass—a idiot.If that’s the eye of the law, the law is a bachelor; and the worst I wish the law is, that his eye may be opened by experience—by experience.”"
"邦布尔先生又一次重重强调了那几个字，然后紧紧地扣上帽子，双手插兜，跟着他的贤妻下楼去了。","Laying great stress on the repetition of these two words, Mr. Bumble fixed his hat on very tight, and putting his hands in his pockets, followed his helpmate downstairs."
"“小姐，”布朗洛先生对罗丝说，“把你的手给我。别抖。还有几句话我们不得不说，但是你完全没有必要害怕。”","“Young lady,” said Mr. Brownlow, turning to Rose, “give me your hand.Do not tremble.You need not fear to hear the few remaining words we have to say.”"
"“如果这些话——我不知道这怎么可能，但如果这些话——跟我有任何关联，”罗丝说，“请一定另找时间告诉我。我现在没有力气，精神也不好。”","“If they have—I do not know how they can, but if they have—any reference to me,” said Rose, “pray let me hear them at some other time.I have not strength or spirits now.”"
"“不，”老绅士挽起她的手臂，回答道，“我相信你的毅力不只如此。先生，你认识这位小姐吗？”","“Nay,” returned the old gentlman, drawing her arm through his; “you have more fortitude than this, I am sure.Do you know this young lady, sir?”"
"“认识。”蒙克斯回答。","“Yes,” replied Monks."
"“我从没见过你。”罗丝说，声音十分虚弱。","“I never saw you before,” said Rose faintly."
"“我可是见过你很多次。”蒙克斯答道。","“I have seen you often,” returned Monks."
"“那不幸的阿格尼丝的父亲有两个女儿。”布朗洛先生说，“另一个女儿——那个孩子的命运如何呢？”","“The father of the unhappy Agnes had—two—daughters,”  said Mr. Brownlow.“What was the fate of the other—the child?”"
"“那个孩子啊，”蒙克斯回答，“她父亲客死他乡，除了一个假名，没留下一封信、一本书，甚至是一张纸片，没法提供一星半点的线索，别人找不到他的朋友或亲戚——后来那个孩子被一户穷苦农家带走了，并将她视如己出，抚养着她。”","“The child,” replied Monks, “when her father died in a strange place, in a strange name, without a letter, book, or scrap of paper that yielded the faintest clue by which his friends or relatives could be traced—the child was taken by some wretched cottagers, who reared it as their own.”"
"“接着说，”布朗洛先生一边示意让梅莱夫人过来，一边说道，“接着说！”","“Go on,” said Mr. Brownlow, signing to Mrs. Maylie to approach.“Go on!”"
"“这些人已经把原来的地方重新翻修过，所以你找不到那地儿了。”蒙克斯说，“但是，友好善心一旦毁灭，憎恶就会滋生。我的母亲找到了她，经过一年巧妙的调查——哈，她终于找到了那个孩子。”","“You couldn’t find the spot to which these people had repaired,” said Monks, “but where friendship fails, hatred will often force a way.My mother found it, after a year of cunning search—ay, and found the child.”"
"“她把她带走了，对么？”","“She took it, did she?”"
"“没有。那家人很穷，逐渐开始厌倦了自己的善心——至少那家的男人是这样的想法。于是，她给了他们一点儿钱，让他们把孩子留下，但那些钱维持不了多久；她答应会再给，可事实上她压根没打算这么做。后来，她嫌那家人的不满和贫穷整得那孩子还不够惨，就把那孩子姐姐的丑事全抖了出来；她还添油加醋，只凭自己喜欢。她提醒那些人，要小心提防这孩子；这孩子是个坏痞子，还是私生子，有一天肯定得走上歪路。她说的一切与实际情况很相符，那些人就信了她。那孩子后来苟且偷生，活得苦不堪言，连我们都感到很满意。直到有一天，一位住在切斯特的寡妇偶然碰到了她，觉得她很可怜，就把她带回了家。我觉得我们是被诅咒了。不管我们怎么努力，她依旧呆在那里，还过得很快活。我有两三年没见过她了，直到几个月前，我才又碰到她。”","“No.The people were poor and began to sicken—at least the man did—of their fine humanity; so she left it with them, giving them a small present of money which would not last long, and promised more, which she never meant to send.She didn’t quite rely, however, on their discontent and poverty for the child’s unhappiness, but told the history of the sister’s shame, with such alterations as suited her; bade them take good heed of the child, for she came of bad blood; and told them she was illegitimate, and sure to go wrong at one time or other.The circumstances countenanced all this; the people believed it; and there the child dragged on an existence, miserable enough even to satisfy us, until a widow lady, residing, then, at Chester, saw the girl by chance, pitied her, and took her home.There was some cursed spell, I think, against us; for in spite of all our efforts she remained there and was happy.I lost sight of her, two or three years ago, and saw her no more until a few months back.”"
"“她此时在你面前吗？”","“Do you see her now?”"
"“在。她正靠着你的胳膊呢。”","“Yes.Leaning on your arm.”"
"“她就是我的侄女，”梅莱夫人一把将那虚弱的女孩揽在怀里，大声说道，“她就是我最最亲爱的孩子。把全世界的财富给我，我也不会丢下她。我可爱的伙伴，我最宝贝的女孩！”","“But not the less my niece,” cried Mrs. Maylie, folding the fainting girl in her arms; “not the less my dearest child.I would not lose her now, for all the treasures of the world.My sweet companion, my own dear girl!”"
"“你是我唯一的朋友，”罗丝紧紧抱住她，说道，“最好最善良的朋友。我的心要炸了。这一切的一切，我再也承受不住了。”","“The only friend I ever had,” cried Rose, clinging to her.“The kindest, best of friends.My heart will burst.I cannot bear all this.”"
"“你比别人经历得多，这些你都挺过来了；你是最善良、最温柔的姑娘，总是把幸福分给认识的每个人。”梅莱夫人温柔地抱着她说，“来，过来，宝贝，还记得吗，这儿有人还等着把你抱在他怀里呢，可怜的孩子！看这儿——看呐，看呐，亲爱的！”","“You have borne more, and have been, through all, the best and gentlest creature that ever shed happiness on every one she knew,” said Mrs. Maylie, embracing her tenderly.“Come, come, my love, remember who this is who waits to clasp you in his arms, poor child!See here—look, look, my dear!”"
"“我不会叫你姨妈的，”奥利弗搂着她的脖子，大声说道，“我永远也不叫你姨妈的——姐姐，我亲爱的好姐姐，难怪有什么东西从一开始就教导我，教我用心去爱你！罗丝，罗丝，亲爱的罗丝！”","“Not aunt,” cried Oliver, throwing his arms about her neck; “I’ll never call her aunt—sister, my own dear sister, that something taught my heart to love so dearly from the first!Rose, dear, darling Rose!”"
"两个孤儿紧紧拥抱在一起，很久很久都不愿分开；他们泪流满面，断断续续地说着话——所有的一切都变得那样神圣。转眼之间，他们知道了自己的父亲、姐姐、母亲都是谁，然而这些亲人都已去世，跟不知道没什么两样。‘’‘’‘’‘’‘’欢乐与哀伤水乳交融，但这里没有痛苦的泪水，因为即使是哀伤本身，也以柔和的形状出现，包裹在这甜蜜亲切的回忆中；所有的苦痛都已不见，化为一种庄严神圣的愉悦。","Let the tears which fell, and the broken words which were exchanged in the long close embrace between the orphans, be sacred.A father, sister, and mother, were gained, and lost, in that one moment.Joy and grief were mingled in the cup; but there were no bitter tears: for even grief itself arose so softened, and clothed in such sweet and tender recollections, that it became a solemn pleasure, and lost all character of pain."
"屋里只剩下他们两个人，时间就这样过了很久很久。最后，门口传来了轻轻的敲门声，门外有人。奥利弗打开门溜了出去，哈里·梅莱走进了房间。","They were a long, long time alone.A soft tap at the door, at length announced that some one was without.Oliver opened it, glided away, and gave place to Harry Maylie."
"“我全知道了。”他拿了把椅子，坐到了这位可爱女士的身旁，说道，“亲爱的罗丝，我全知道了。”","“I know it all,” he said, taking a seat beside the lovely girl.“Dear Rose, I know it all.”"
"“我到这儿来，并不是偶然。”他停了下来，沉默了很长一段时间，接着又继续说道，“我也不是今晚才知道这一切的，我昨天就知道了——不过也就是昨天。你猜到了吗？我这次来，是为了向你重提一个承诺的。”","“I am not here by accident,” he added after a lengthened silence; “nor have I heard all this to-night, for I knew it yesterday—only yesterday.Do you guess that I have come to remind you of a promise?”"
"“等等，”罗丝说道，“你全都知道了。”","“Stay,” said Rose.“You—do—know all.”"
"“我全都知道了。你允诺过我，在这一年之内的任何时间，我都可以重提我们最后一次谈到的话题。”","“All.You gave me leave, at any time within a year, to renew the subject of our last discourse.”"
"“是的，我这么说过。”","“I did.”"
"“我不是想逼你改变主意。”年轻人继续说道，“但如果你愿意的话，我想听你再说一遍你的决定。无论我拥有何种地位或财富，都会置于你脚下任你支配。倘若你仍然坚持你之前的决定，我也郑重承诺过，绝不用任何言语或行动加以改变。”","“Not to press you to alter your determination,” pursued the young man, “but to hear you repeat it, if you would.I was to lay whatever of station or fortune I might possess at your feet, and if you still adhered to your former determination, I pledged myself, by no word or act, to seek to change it.”"
"“曾经影响我做决定的原因，现在仍然影响着我。”罗丝斩钉截铁地答道，“你的母亲心地善良，把我从穷困潦倒、水深火热的生活中解救出来。我感到，我对她负有不可推卸的责任，而且，这种感觉何时像今晚这般强烈过？这是场斗争。”罗丝又说，“但这是一场我为之骄傲的斗争；虽然痛苦，但我甘心承受。”","“The same reasons which influenced me then, will influence me now,” said Rose firmly.“If I ever owed a strict and rigid duty to her, whose goodness saved me from a life of indigence and suffering, when should I ever feel it, as I should to-night?It is a struggle,” said Rose, “but one I am proud to make; it is a pang, but one my heart shall bear.”"
"“今晚揭露的真相——”哈里刚打开话头。","“The disclosure of to-night,” —Harry began."
"“今晚揭露的真相，”罗丝轻声接过他的话，“没有改变我原来的立场；有关你的问题，我立场依旧。”","“The disclosure of to-night,” replied Rose softly, “leaves me in the same position, with reference to you, as that in which I stood before.”"
"“你对我真是太狠心了，罗丝。”她的恋人步步紧逼。","“You harden your heart against me, Rose,” urged her lover."
"“哦，哈里，哈里，”年轻的姑娘放声大哭，“我也希望能答应你，也希望能把自己从这痛苦中解脱出去呀。”","“Oh Harry, Harry,” said the young lady, bursting into tears; “I wish I could, and spare myself this pain.”"
"“那你为何要如此痛苦地折磨自己呢？”哈里握着她的手，问道，","“Then why inflict it on yourself?” said Harry, taking her hand."
"“想想看，亲爱的罗丝，想想你今晚听到的事情。”","“Think, dear Rose, think what you have heard to-night.”"
"“我都听到了些什么！我都听到了些什么！”罗丝大声说道，","“And what have I heard!What have I heard!” cried Rose."
"“我父亲感到颜面失尽，这种羞耻感在他心中扎得如此之深，他因此避开了所有人——好了，我们已经说够多了，哈里，我们已经说够多了。”","“That a sense of his deep disgrace so worked upon my own father that he shunned all—there, we have said enough, Harry, we have said enough.”"
"“还不够，还不够。”罗丝想要站起来，年轻人却拦住了她，“我的希望、心愿、前程、感情，以及其他所有对生活的看法都发生了改变，唯有对你的感情不变。现在，我要给你的，不是在喧嚣世间的显赫声名，更不是与这个充满怨恨与诽谤的世道同流合污的行动。在这个世上，正直诚实的人被抹黑诋毁，而污蔑他们的人才是真正的恬不知耻。我要给你的是一个家——真心一颗和爱巢一个——是的，亲爱的罗丝，我能给你的，只有这些。”","“Not yet, not yet,” said the young man, detaining her as she rose.“My hopes, my wishes, prospects, feeling: every thought in life except my love for you: have undergone a change.I offer you, now, no distinction among a bustling crowd; no mingling with a world of malice and detraction, where the blood is called into honest cheeks by aught but real disgrace and shame; but a home—a heart and home—yes, dearest Rose, and those, and those alone, are all I have to offer.”"
"“你在说什么！”她的声音都发颤了。","“What do you mean!”　She faltered."
"“我不过是想说，自从我上次离开你之后，我就下定决心，要铲平你我之间一切虚幻的阻碍。如果我的世界不能成为你的，那就让你的世界成为我的吧。我不会让你受到任何门第之见的撇嘴蔑视，因为我根本不在乎这些。这一点我已经做到了。那些因此而躲避我的人，也曾躲避你，这就证明了你一直都是对的。当初那些对我笑脸相迎的权贵，那些有权有势、地位显要的亲戚们，如今对我却是冷眼相待。但在英格兰最富裕的一个郡里，有微笑的田野和摇曳的树木，还有一个乡村教堂——那是我的，罗丝，那是我的！在教堂边，有个乡村小屋；如果你能住进去，我将会以它为荣，比起我放弃的所有心愿，要自豪一千倍。这就是我现在的地位和身份，我全放于此！”","“I mean but this—that when I left you last, I left you with a firm determination to level all fancied barriers between yourself and me; resolved that if my world could not be yours, I would make yours mine; that no pride of birth should curl the lip at you, for I would turn from it.This I have done.Those who have shrunk from me because of this, have shrunk from you, and proved you so far right.Such power and patronage: such relatives of influence and rank: as smiled upon me then, look coldly now; but there are smiling fields and waving trees in England’s richest county; and by one village church—mine, Rose, my own!—there stands a rustic dwelling which you can make me prouder of, than all the hopes I have renounced, measured a thousandfold.This is my rank and station now, and here I lay it down!”"
"“要等坠入爱河的人共进晚餐，可真是件令人难受的事啊。”格林维格先生睡醒了，一边把盖在头上的手帕拉下来，一边这样说道。","“It’s a trying thing waiting supper for lovers,” said Mr. Grimwig, waking up, and pulling his pocket-handkerchief from over his head."
"说实话，晚餐很早就备好了，只是这等候的时间实在是有些超出常理。梅莱夫人、哈里和罗丝（他们三人是一块儿进来的）中没人为了缓和气氛，开口说话。","Truth to tell, the supper had been waiting a most unreasonable time.Neither Mrs. Maylie, nor Harry, nor Rose (who all came in together), could offer a word in extenuation."
"“我今晚真想把我的脑袋吃掉，”格林维格先生说道，“因为我已经觉得我吃不着别的东西了。请恕我冒昧，如果你们不介意的话，我可要向准新娘表示祝贺了。”","“I had serious thoughts of eating my head to-night,” said Mr. Grimwig, “for I began to think I should get nothing else.I’ll take the liberty, if you’ll allow me, of saluting the bride that is to be.”"
"说时迟那时快，格林维格先生立刻付诸行动，吻了一下那个涨红了脸的姑娘。在这个实例的感染下，医生和布朗洛先生也相继模仿了他。有人声称，刚才哈里·梅莱在隔壁那间黑漆漆的屋子里已首创了先例，但最具权威的人士认为这纯属造谣，因为哈里年纪尚轻，还是位牧师。","Mr. Grimwig lost no time in carrying this notice into effect upon the blushing girl; and the example, being contagious, was followed both by the doctor and Mr. Brownlow: some people affirm that Harry Maylie had been observed to set it, orginally, in a dark room adjoining; but the best authorities consider this downright scandal: he being young and a clergyman."
"“奥利弗，我的孩子，”梅莱夫人道，“你去哪儿了，为什么你看上去如此悲伤？你看你，不声不响，眼泪都顺着脸颊流下来了。出什么事了啦？”","“Oliver, my child,” said Mrs. Maylie, “where have you been, and why do you look so sad?There are tears stealing down your face at this moment.What is the matter?”"
"有的希望我们最为珍视，有的希望给予了我们的本性最崇高的荣誉，但当我们怀着这些希望时，这个世界往往令我们失望透顶。","It is a world of disappointment: often to the hopes we most cherish, and hopes that do our nature the greatest honour."
"可怜的迪克死了！","Poor Dick was dead!"
"第五十二章 费金在人世间的最后一夜","CHAPTER LII Fagin’s last night alive"
"上至屋顶，下至地板，法庭里堆满了人的面孔。这里的每一寸空间都挤满了眼睛，每一双都在好奇而急切地向外张望着。从被告席前面的围栏，到旁听席最狭小、棱角最分明的角落，所有人的目光都集中在一个人的身上——费金。他前前后后，上上下下，左左右右，仿佛被一个大天幕包围了起来，上面布满了闪闪发亮的眼睛。","The court was paved, from floor to roof, with human faces.Inquisitive and eager eyes peered from every inch of space.From the rail before the dock, away into the sharpest angle of the smallest corner in the galleries, all looks were fixed upon one man—Fagin.Before him and behind: above, below, on the right and on the left: he seemed to stand surrounded by a firmament, all bright with gleaming eyes."
"众目睽睽之下，他站在那里，一手扶着前面的木板，一手罩在耳朵上。他的头使劲向前倾，以便能够更清楚地听到审判长所说的每一个字眼；后者正在向陪审团陈述关于他的指控。他不时地将目光猛地转向陪审团，观察他们对陈述中一些有利于自己的极其细微之处作何反应。当审判长掷地有声地历数其罪行时，他又转向自己的法律顾问，无声地请求他，不管何时也要替他辩护一二。除了这些焦虑不安的表现以外，他的手脚没动弹过一下。开庭以来，他几乎一动也没动过。此刻，审判长已经陈述完毕，他却仍然保持着那副全神贯注的样子，弓着身盯着审判长，好像还在仔细倾听着。","He stood there, in all this glare of living light, with one hand resting on the wooden slab before him, the other held to his ear, and his head thrust forward to enable him to catch with greater distinctness every word that fell from the presiding judge, who was delivering his charge to the jury.At times, he turned his eyes sharply upon them to observe the effect of the slightest featherweight in his favour; and when the points against him were stated with terrible distinctness, looked towards his counsel, in mute appeal that he would, even then, urge something in his behalf.Beyond these manifestations of anxiety, he stirred not hand or foot.He had scarcely moved since the trial began; and now that the judge ceased to speak, he still remained in the same strained attitude of close attention, with his gaze bent on him, as though he listened still."
"突然，法庭里起了一阵小骚动，他这才醒过神来。他转过头去，看见陪审团正凑到一起，讨论着该如何裁定。他目光游移，不知不觉又看到了旁听席上。人们为了看清他，争先恐后地站了起来：有的赶忙带上眼镜，有的则与邻座小声耳语，厌恶之情溢于言表。还有一些人根本不理会他，只是不难烦地盯着陪审团看，不明白他们怎么能拖这么长时间。但是他没能从一张脸上——即便是从在场为数众多的女人脸上——读到哪怕一丝对自己的同情。他只能感觉到，在场所有的人都有一个共同的心愿，那就是将他惩以重刑。","A slight bustle in the court, recalled him to himself.Looking round, he saw that the juryman had turned together, to consider their verdict.As his eyes wandered to the gallery, he could see the people rising above each other to see his face: some hastily applying their glasses to their eyes: and others whispering their neighbours with looks expressive of abhorrence.A few there were, who seemed unmindful of him, and looked only to the jury, in impatient wonder how they could delay.But in no one face—not even among the women, of whom there were many there—could he read the faintest sympathy with himself, or any feeling but one of all-absorbing interest that he should be condemned."
"正当他瞟见这一切，张皇失措之时，四周围再一次死一般地沉寂了下来。他回头一看，陪审团已转向法官。肃静！","As he saw all this in one bewildered glance, the deathlike stillness came again, and looking back he saw that the jurymen had turned towards the judge.Hush!"
"他们只是请求退到庭外，以便考虑裁决。","They only sought permission to retire."
"陪审员们一一离开。他带着渴望的眼神，观察着他们中每个人的脸色；他试图看出大多数人倾向于哪种判决，但这不过是徒劳罢了。看守拍了拍他的肩膀。他呆呆地随他走到被告席的尽头，然后坐到了一把椅子上。要不是看守指了指那把椅子，他肯定看不到自己的座位。","He looked, wistfully, into their faces, one by one when they passed out, as though to see which way the greater number leant; but that was fruitless.The jailer touched him on the shoulder.He followed mechanically to the end of the dock, and sat down on a chair.The man pointed it out, or he would not have seen it."
"他又抬头向旁听席望去。有人正在吃东西；还有人因为人群中太热，正拿着手帕扇风。还有个年轻小伙子正在一个小笔记本上画他的素描。他很想知道，这小伙子画得究竟像不像，于是便像个无所事事的观众那样，一直盯着他看，一直看到那位艺术家把铅笔尖折断了，又拿起小刀削起铅笔来。","He looked up into the gallery again.Some of the people were eating, and some fanning themselves with handkerchiefs; for the crowded place was very hot.There was one young man sketching his face in a little note-book.He wondered whether it was like, and looked on when the artist broke his pencil-point, and made anot her with his knife, as any idle spectator might have done."
"他又跟刚才一样漫不经心地将注意力转向法官，开始琢磨他一身行头的款式、价格和穿法。审判席上有位胖胖的老绅士，大约半个小时前走了出去，这时候又回来了。他心里想着这个人是不是出去吃晚饭了？吃了什么？在哪儿吃的？就这样，他一直漫无边际地乱琢磨，直到看见某个新目标，然后又开始下一段胡思乱想。","In the same way, when he turned his eyes towards the judge, his mind began to busy itself with the fashion of his dress, and what it cost, and how he put it on.There was an old fat gentleman on the bench, too, who had gone out, some half an hour before, and now come back.He wondered within himself whether this man had been to get his dinner, what he had had, and where he had had it; and pursued this train of careless thought until some new object caught his eye and roused another."
"这段时间以来，他没有一刻能摆脱得了一种难以承受的压抑，甚至会感觉坟墓已在他脚下大张着打开。这种感觉虽然模糊不清、无法详说，但一直困扰着他，使他无法安心思考。他一想到快要到来的死亡，就会浑身发抖、五脏欲焚。即便如此，因为上述原因，他仍会不由自主地数起面前铁栏杆上的尖头，琢磨着其中的一个尖头是如何折断的，他们是准备把这尖头修好呢，还是就这么着了呢。接着，他又想起了绞刑架和断头台的种种可怖之处——接着又停下思考，看着一个男的朝地上泼水降温——接着又继续胡思乱想。","Not that, all this time, his mind was, for an instant, free from one oppressive overwhelming sense of the grave that opened at his feet; it was ever present to him, but in a vague and general way, and he could not fix his thoughts upon it.Thus, even while he trembled, and turned burning hot at the idea of speedy death, he fell to counting the iron spikes before him, and wondering how the head of one had been broken off, and whether they would mend it, or leave it as it was.Then, he thought of all the horrors of the gallows and the scaffold—and stopped to watch a man sprinkling the floor to cool it—and then went on to think again."
"终于，有人喊了一声“肃静”，众人皆屏住呼吸，一同朝门口望去。陪审员们擦着他的身走了过去，又回到了法庭上。他们面无表情，一个个都如石像一般；他从他们脸上读不出任何东西。全场随即鸦雀无声——没有一丝沙沙声——没有一丝呼吸声——“被告罪名成立”！","At length there was a cry of silence, and a breathless look from all towards the door.The jury returned, and passed him close.He could glean nothing from their faces; they might as well have been of stone.Perfect stillness ensued—not a rustle—not a breath—Guilty."
"大楼里响起了巨大的呼喊声，一声接着一声；然后又回荡起呻吟叹息；声浪起伏，愈来愈响，如同愤怒的雷鸣。法庭外，群众发出一片响亮的欢呼声，庆祝他将于周一被处死这则消息。","The building rang with a tremendous shout, and another, and another, and then it echoed loud groans, that gathered strength as they swelled out, like angry thunder.It was a peal of joy from the populace outside, greeting the news that he would die on Monday."
"喧嚣声渐渐平息了下来，有人问他是否对死刑有异议。他又摆出了之前那副认真倾听的样子。问话人向他提出这个问题时，他只是专注地看着他。但这问题重复了两遍，他似乎才听进去，接着也只是嘟囔着自己不过是个老头——是个老头——诸如此类的话。他越说越轻，像是在低声自语，然后就再次沉默了。","The noise subsided, and he was asked if he had anything to say why sentence of death should not be passed upon him.He had resumed his listening attitude, and looked intently at his questioner while the demand was made; but it was twice repeated before he seemed to hear it, and then he only muttered that he was an old man—an old man—and so, dropping into a whisper, was silent again."
"法官戴上了黑色法帽，准备宣判死刑；犯人仍旧一动不动地站在那里，神色也没什么变化。旁听席上的一个女人觉得这肃穆的气氛甚是可怕，不由地惊呼了一声。他慌忙抬起头，似乎对这干扰很是恼怒，然后又把身体往前倾了一些，显得更为专注了。宣判是庄严而令人难忘的，而所宣判的刑罚是令人毛骨悚然的。但他仍像座大理石雕一般，一动不动地站在那里。直到看守一手压在他的胳膊上，叫他退席时，他那张憔悴的脸依然使劲朝前伸着，下巴耷拉下来，双眼凸出，直直地盯着前方。他呆呆地朝四下里望了一眼，这才跟着他走了。","The judge assumed the black cap, and the prisoner still stood with the same air and gesture.A woman in the gallery, uttered some exclamation, called forth by this dread solemnity; he looked hastily up as if angry at the interruption, and bent forward yet more attentively.The address was solemn and impressive; the sentence fearful to hear.But he stood, like a marble figure, without the motion of a nerve.His haggard face was still thrust forward, his under-jaw hanging down, and his eyes staring out before him, when the jailer put his hand upon his arm, and beckoned him away.He gazed stupidly about him for an instant, and obeyed."
"看守把他带到法庭下面的一间石板房间里，几名犯人正在那里等候提审，还有几名正和挤在围栏前的亲友说话；透过这个围栏，里面的人可以观察到外面院子中的一举一动。房间里没人理会他。可当他经过时，犯人们都向后退了退，好让那些挤在围栏前的人把他看得更清楚些。这些人用不堪入耳的字眼辱骂他，冲他尖叫，还用嘘声轰他。他挥了挥拳头，想朝他们脸上吐口唾沫教训一下他们，可是几名带路的看守催着他往前走。他们穿过一段灯光昏暗的甬道，到了监狱的内部。","They led him through a paved room under the court, where some prisoners were waiting till their turns came, and others were talking to their friends, who crowded round a grate which looked into the open yard.There was nobody there to speak to-him-; but, as he passed, the prisoners fell back to render him more visible to the people who were clinging to the bars: and they assailed him with opprobrious names, and screeched and hissed.He shook his fist, and would have spat upon them; but his conductors hurried him on, through a gloomy passage lighted by a few dim lamps, into the interior of the prison."
"在这里，看守把他从头到脚搜查了一遍，确定他身上没有带任何能抢在法律前面了结他的工具。这仪式执行完毕后，看守把他带到了一间关押死刑犯的牢房，留他一人呆在那里。","Here, he was searched, that he might not have about him the means of anticipating the law; this ceremony performed, they led him to one of the condemned cells, and left him there—alone."
"他在牢房门对面的一张长条石凳上坐了下来，这石凳既能坐又能躺。他睁着那双充血的眼睛，盯着地板，试图理清自己的思绪。过了一会儿，他开始记起法官那一席话中的几个断断续续的片段，尽管当时他好像一个字也没能听进去。渐渐地，这些杂乱的片段还原到了原本的顺序，信息一点一点地显露出来，愈来愈完整；不一会儿，他就全明白了，所用的时间几乎和宣布判决一样短。结果就是——判处绞刑，直到他被绞死。判处绞刑，直到被绞死。","He sat down on a stone bench opposite the door, which served for seat and bedstead; and casting his blood-shot eyes upon the ground, tried to collect his thoughts.After awhile, he began to remember a few disjointed fragments of what the judge had said: though it had seemed to him, at the time, that he could not hear a word.These gradually fell into their proper places, and by degrees suggested more: so that in a little time he had the whole, almost as it was delivered.To be hanged by the neck, till he was dead—that was the end.To be hanged by the neck till he was dead."
"牢房里越来越黑，已经伸手不见五指。他开始回忆所有他认识的死在绞刑台上的人，其中有一些还是经他陷害死掉的。他们的样子一个接一个浮现在他脑海中，数都数不过来。他曾亲眼见过其中一些人死去——而且还拿他们开玩笑，因为他们到死还在念祷告。那块踏板哐当一声掉下来，转瞬之间，那些人从身强体壮、精力充沛的汉子变成了一副副悬在空中的皮囊！","As it came on very dark, he began to think of all the men he had known who had died upon the scaffold; some of them through his means.They rose up, in such quick succession, that he could hardly count them.He had seen some of them die,—and had joked too, because they died with prayers upon their lips.With what a rattling noise the drop went down; and how suddenly they changed, from strong and vigorous men to dangling heaps of clothes!"
"他们当中的一些人可能就住过这间牢房——甚至还坐过这个地方。牢房里这么黑，为什么不点个灯呢？这间牢房已经建了很多年了。一定有很多人在这里度过他们人生中最后的几个小时。他好像坐在一个地下墓穴里，里面到处是死尸——套在头上的帽子、绳索，被捆住的胳膊，一张张他熟悉的面孔，即使有那可怕的面罩挡着，他也认得出来。——点个灯，点个灯！","Some of them might have inhabited that very cell—sat upon that very spot.It was very dark; why didn’t they bring a light?The cell had been built for many years.Scores of men must have passed their last hours there.It was like sitting in a vault strewn with dead bodies—the cap, the noose, the pinioned arms, the faces that he knew, even beneath that hideous veil.—Light, light!"
"他用手敲打着结实的牢门和墙壁，直敲到皮破血流，这时才终于来了两个人。其中一人拿着一支蜡烛，插进了固定在墙上的铁烛台上；另一人拖进来一床垫子，准备在这里过夜。这下子，犯人就不再是独自一人了。","At length, when his hands were raw with beating against the heavy door and walls, two men appeared: one bearing a candle, which he thrust into an iron candlestick fixed against the wall: the other dragging in a mattress on which to pass the night; for the prisoner was to be left alone no more."
"夜晚来临了——漆黑、阴沉、沉寂的夜晚。教堂的钟声响起了。其他的守夜人听到了都很高兴，他们能从中领悟到生命的存在和明日的来临。于他而言，这钟声带来的却是绝望。铁钟每轰鸣一次，就会传来一声经久不息的声音，低沉而又空洞——那便是死亡的声音。早晨那喜气洋洋的喧嚣与吵闹已渗入了牢房中，但这对他又有何用呢？这是另外一种形式的丧钟，警告中还带有嘲讽的意味。","Then came the night—dark, dismal, silent night.Other watchers are glad to hear this church-clock strike, for they tell of life and coming day.To him they brought despair.The boom of every iron bell came laden with the one, deep, hollow sound—Death.What availed the noise and bustle of cheerful morning, which penetrated even there, to him?It was another form of knell, with mockery added to the warning."
"白天过去了。白天？这里根本没有白天，即使有也来去匆匆——然后黑夜便再次降临。黑夜既漫长又短暂：漫长是因为那死一般的沉寂，短暂是因为那也不过是飞逝而过的几小时而已。他有时胡言乱语，甚至对神不敬；有时又嚎啕大哭，还会揪扯自己的头发。几位和他宗教信仰相同的德高望重者曾到他身旁做祈祷，但都被他咒骂着赶走了。他们本打算再施善举，可他竟把人打跑了。","The day passed off.Day?There was no day; it was gone as soon as come—and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence, and short in its fleeting hours.At one time he raved and blasphemed; and at another howled and tore his hair.Venerable men of his own persuasion had come to pray beside him, but he had driven them away with curses.They renewed their charitable efforts, and he beat them off."
"礼拜六晚上。他活在人世的时间只剩下一夜了。他一想到这里，天已破晓——礼拜天到了。","Saturday night.He had only one night more to live.And as he thought of this, the day broke—Sunday."
"直到这可怕的最后一夜，一种绝望无助的幻灭感才向他那枯萎凋零的灵魂发出全力的一击。他倒不是抱有某种确定或积极向上的希望，以为自己能够得到宽恕。他只是从来没有、甚至没有从最微小的可能性出发，考虑过死亡已经如此临近。他和那两个轮流看守他的人几乎没说过话，那两个人也没打算引起他的注意。他坐在那里，人醒着，却一直在做梦。此刻他时时惊跳起来，喘着粗气，浑身皮肤犹如火烤，慌乱地走来走去。他的恐惧与暴躁突然发作，连那两位看守——他们本对这种场面司空见惯——都恐惧万分、连连后退。最后，在他自己的险恶心肠的折磨下，他变得十分可怕。那两个男人都不敢独自坐在那儿面对他，于是他们两人一起看守他。","It was not until the night of this last awful day, that a withering sense of his helpless, desperate state came in its full intensity upon his blighted soul; not that he had ever held any defined or positive hope of mercy, but that he had never been able to consider more than the dim probability of dying so soon.He had spoken little to either of the two men, who relieved each other in their attendance upon him; and they, for their parts, made no effort to rouse his attention.He had sat there, awake, but dreaming.Now, he started up, every minute, and with gasping mouth and burning skin, hurried to and fro, in such a paroxysm of fear and wrath that even they—used to such sights—recoiled from him with horror.He grew so terrible, at last, in all the tortures of his evil conscience, that one man could not bear to sit there, eyeing him alone; and so the two kept watch together."
"他又怯懦地缩回石床上，回想起从前的事。那天他被逮捕的时候，被人群中掷出的什么东西打伤了，头上缠着块亚麻布。他红色的头发垂落在毫无血色的脸上，被扯掉不少的胡子拧成一结一结的，眼睛里还闪着凶光；他很久没洗澡了，又发起了高烧，连皮肤都被烧得起了皱。八点——九点——十点。若这不仅仅是一个吓唬他的恶作剧，而是实实在在纷至沓来的一个又一个小时，那么当时间轮转回来的时候，他又会在哪儿呢！十一点！又是一声钟鸣，此时前一个整点的钟声还没停止振动。八点钟，他将是自己的葬礼行列中唯一的哀悼者；十一点到了——新门监狱那可怕的围墙曾掩藏了多少不幸和无法言说的痛苦，它不仅瞒过了人们的眼睛，且因处罚太过频繁，存在太过长久，还瞒过了人们的思维。就是这样的一面围墙，也从未见过如此可怖的场面。几个路过的人在门外徘徊了一会儿，琢磨着明天就要被绞死的人正在做什么；他们要是真能看到他，那天晚上就别想睡好了。","He cowered down upon his stone bed, and thought of the past.He had been wounded with some missiles from the crowd on the day of his capture, and his head was bandaged with a linen cloth.His red hair hung down upon his bloodless face; his beard was torn, and Twisted into knots; his eyes shone with a terrible light; his unwashed flesh crackled with the fever that burnt him up.Eight—nine—ten.If it was not a trick to frighten him, and those were the real hours treading on each other’s heels, where would he be, when they came round again!Eleven!Another struck, before the voice of the previous hour had ceased to vibrate.At eight, he would be the only mourner in his own funeral train; at eleven— Those dreadful walls of Newgate, which have hidden so much misery and such unspeakable anguish, not only from the eyes, but, too often, and too long, from the thoughts, of men, never held so dread a spectacle as that.The few who lingered as they passed, and wondered what the man was doing who was to be hanged tomorrow, would have slept but ill that night, if they could have seen him."
"从黄昏一直到近乎午夜，三三两两的人们不断出现在接待室门口，神情急切地打听那里有没有接到什么缓刑的命令。他们得到了否定的回答，然后便将这大快人心的消息奔走相告，传给大街上一团一团的人群。大家指着一个又一个的门，讨论着犯人肯定会从哪道门出来，比划着绞刑台会在哪儿搭建，最后才拖着不情愿的脚步离开，不时地还回过头看上一眼，在脑中构想着行刑的场景。人们一个接一个离开了；一个小时后，在这死寂的夜晚里，街道上唯余一片孤寂和黑暗。","From early in the evening until nearly midnight, little groups of two and three presented themselves at the lodge-gate, and inquired, with anxious faces, whether any reprieve had been received.These being answered in the negative, communicated the welcome intelligence to clusters in the street, who pointed out to one another the door from which he must come out, and showed where the scaffold would be built, and, walking with unwilling steps away, turned back to conjure up the scene.By degrees they fell off, one by one; and, for an hour, in the dead of night, the street was left to solitude and darkness."
"监狱前的空地已清理出来，街道四周都用结实的黑漆栅栏围了起来，以挡住预期中将会出现的大量民众的推挤。此时，布朗洛先生和奥利弗出现在栅栏入口，出示了一张名誉市长签过字的准许探监令。把守的人随即放行，还把他们领进了接待室。","The space before the prison was cleared, and a few strong barriers, painted black, had been already thrown across the road to break the pressure of the expected crowd, when Mr. Brownlow and Oliver appeared at the wicket, and presented an order of admission to the prisoner, signed by one of the sheriffs.They were immediately admitted into the lodge."
"“这位小绅士也一起去吗，先生？”负责引路的警察问道，","“Is the young gentleman to come too, sir?” said the man whose duty was to conduct them."
"“监狱可不是一个适合小孩参观的地方，先生。”","“It’s not a sight for children, sir.”"
"“的确不适合小孩子看，我的朋友。”布朗洛先生回答道，“但是我与这个人之间的事情同这个孩子密切相关，并且这孩子在此人为非作歹最为猖狂的时候见过他，所以我想即使需要忍受些痛苦和恐惧，这孩子现在也该见见他。”","“It is not indeed, my friend,” rejoined Mr. Brownlow; “but my business with this man is intimately connected with him; and as this child has seen him in the full career of his success and villainy, I think it as well—even at the cost of some pain and fear—that he should see him now.”"
"两个人走到了一旁交谈，为了不让奥利弗听到这番话。警察摸了摸帽子，好奇地瞟了奥利弗一眼，然后打开了与他们进来的那道门相对的另一道门，带他们穿过一条条黑暗曲折的甬道，向牢房走去。","These few words had been said apart, so as to be inaudible to Oliver.The man touched his hat; and glancing at Oliver with some curiousity, opened another gate, opposite to that by which they had entered, and led them on, through dark and winding ways, towards the cells."
"“这儿，”警察在一条幽暗的通道处停了下来，几名工人正在那里一声不响地做着一些准备工作，“这儿就是他上路的地方。如果你们走这边，可以看到他出去时会经过的那道门。”","“This,” said the man, stopping in a gloomy passage where a couple of workmen were making some preparations in profound silence—“this is the place he passes through.If you step this way, you can see the door he goes out at.”"
"他带他们走进一间石头砌成的厨房，里面摆放着为犯人做饭的铜锅，他又指了指另一道门。门的上方有一个敞开的栅栏，从那里传来男人说话的声音，还混杂着捶击声和木板掉落的声音。这是工人们正在搭建绞刑架。","He led them into a stone kitchen, fitted with coppers for dressing the prison food, and pointed to a door.There was an open grating above it, through which came the sound of men’s voices, mingled with the noise of hammering, and the throwing down of boards.There were putting up the scaffold."
"他们从这里穿过几道结实的牢门，这些牢门都是由别的狱警从里面打开的；接着走进一个露天大院，上了一段狭窄的楼梯，进入走廊，走廊的左手边是一排坚固的牢门。狱警示意他们呆在原地别动，然后拿出一串钥匙，在其中的一个牢门上敲了敲。两位看守小声耳语了几句后，出了牢房走到走廊里，舒展了一下筋骨，好像对这次临时的换班很是高兴，然后便示意探视人跟着那位警察进牢房。布朗洛先生和奥利弗走了进去。","From this place, they passed through several strong gates, opened by other turnkeys from the inner side; and, having entered an open yard, ascended a flight of narrow steps, and came into a passage with a row of strong doors on the left hand.Motioning them to remain where they were, the turnkey knocked at one of these with his bunch of keys.The two attendants, after a little whispering, came out into the passage, stretching themselves as if glad of the temporary relief, and motioned the visitors to follow the jailer into the cell.They did so."
"那名死刑犯坐在床上，身体摇来晃去，表情不大像人类，反倒更像是一头落入陷阱的野兽。很显然，他的心思正徘徊于往事之间，因为他们进来后，他仍在喃喃自语，除了把他们当作自己幻觉的一部分外，根本没有意识到他们的到来。","The condemned criminal was seated on his bed, rocking himself from side to side, with a countenance more like that of a snared beast than the face of a man.His mind was evidently wandering to his old life, for he continued to mutter, without appearing conscious of their presence otherwise than as a part of his vision."
"“好小子，查利——干得好——”他嘟囔着，“还有奥利弗，哈！哈！哈！还有奥利弗——现在他越发地像个绅士了——越发地——带这孩子去睡觉！”","“Good boy, Charley—well done—” he mumbled.“Oliver, too, ha! ha! ha!Oliver too—quite the gentleman now—quite the—take that boy away to bed!”"
"狱警拉起奥利弗那只空着的手，轻声嘱咐他不要惊慌，自己在一旁静观其变。","The jailer took the disengaged hand of Oliver; and, whispering him not to be alarmed, looked on without speaking."
"“带他睡觉去！”费金大声喊道，","“Take him away to bed!” cried Fagin."
"“你们听到我说话了吗，你们几个？他就是——就是——所有一切的起因。花钱把他养大真值——割断博尔特的喉咙，比尔。不要管那丫头——博尔特的脖子，你能割多深就割多深。把他的头锯掉算了！”","“Do you hear me, some of you?He has been the—the—somehow the cause of all this.It’s  worth the money to bring him up to it—Bolter’s throat, Bill; never mind the girl—Bolter’s throat as deep as you can cut.Saw his head off!”"
"“费金！”狱警叫道。","“Fagin,” said the jailer."
"“我就是！”犹太佬喊道，转眼间又恢复成他受审时那副认真细听的样子，","“That’s me!” cried the Jew, falling instantly, into the attitude of listening he had assumed upon his trial."
" “我年纪大了，大人，我的年纪已经很大很大了！”","“An old man, my Lord; a very old, old man!”"
"“嘿，”狱警把手放在费金胸口上，示意他别起身，然后说道，“有人想见你，我想他们是要问你几个问题。费金，费金！你还是不是人？”","“Here,” said the turnkey, laying his hand upon his breast to keep him down.“Here’s somebody wants to see you, to ask you some questions, I suppose.Fagin, Fagin!Are you a man?”"
"“很快就不是了。”他抬起头回答道，脸上属于人的表情已经荡然无存，只剩下狂怒与恐惧，“把他们全揍死！他们有什么权利宰了我？”","“I shan’t be one long,” he replied, looking up with a face retaining no human expression but rage and terror.“Strike them all dead!What right have they to butcher me?”"
"说这话时，他终于看到了奥利弗和布朗洛先生。他立刻就往石凳最远处的角落里缩，一边退还一边问他们，来这儿想干什么。","As he spoke he caught sight of Oliver and Mr. Brownlow.Shrinking to the furthest corner of the seat, he demanded to know what they wanted there."
"“镇定。”狱警说道，手还压在他胸口上，“您请，先生，告诉他您想要什么。请快一点儿，时间越久，他会越来越不成人样。”","“Steady,” said the turnkey, still holding him down.“Now, sir, tell him what you want.Quick, if you please, for he grows worse as the time gets on.”"
"“你手上有些文件，”布朗洛先生上前说道，“是一个叫做蒙克斯的人为了安全起见，交到你手上的。”","“You have some papers,” said Mr. Brownlow advancing, “which were placed in your hands, for better security, by a man called Monks.”"
"“一派胡言！”费金答道，“我没有什么文件——连一份也没有。”","“It’s all a lie together,” replied Fagin.“I haven’t one—not one.”"
"“看在上帝的份上，”布朗洛先生严肃地说，“临死前就别在这儿撒谎了，告诉我，那些文件在哪儿。你知道赛克斯死了，蒙克斯也招供了，别指望还能再捞点儿什么了。那些文件在哪儿？”","“For the love of God,” said Mr. Brownlow solemnly, “do not say that now, upon the very verge of death; but tell me where they are.You know that Sikes is dead; that Monks has confessed; that there is no hope of any further gain.Where are those papers?”"
"“奥利弗！”费金一边喊，一边向他招手，“过来这边，过来这边！我悄悄告诉你。”","“Oliver,” cried Fagin, beckoning to him.“Here, here!Let me whisper to you.”"
"“我不怕。”奥利弗松开布朗洛先生的手，低声说道。","“I am not afraid,” said Oliver in a low voice, as he relinquished Mr. Brownlow’s hand."
"“那些文件，”费金说着，把奥利弗朝自己这边拉，“在一个帆布包里。前面最高的那间屋子有个烟囱，靠近烟囱上方的地方有个洞，包就在那个洞里。我想跟你聊聊，亲爱的，我想跟你聊聊。”","“The papers,” said Fagin, drawing Oliver towards him, “are in a canvas bag, in a hole a little way up the chimney in the top front-room.I want to talk to you, my dear.I want to talk to you.”"
"“好的，好的。”奥利弗答道，“那我念段祷告吧。来吧！我念一段祷告。你跟我一起跪下吧，我就只念一段，然后我们可以一直聊到明天早上。”","“Yes, yes,” returned Oliver.“Let me say a prayer.Do!Let me say one prayer.Say only one, upon your knees, with me, and we will talk till morning.”"
"“到外面去，到外面去。”费金回答，他推着奥利弗往门口走去，眼神越过他的头顶，茫然地看着前方，“你就跟他们说，我已经睡觉了——他们会相信你的。这样，你就能把我弄出去了。快啊，快！”","“Outside, outside,” replied Fagin, pushing the boy before him towards the door, and looking vacantly over his head.“Say I’ve  gone to sleep—they’ll believe you.You can get me out, if you take me so.Now then, now then!”"
"“哦！上帝原谅这可怜的人吧！”男孩嚎啕大哭。","“Oh!God forgive this wretched man!” cried the boy with a burst of tears."
"“这就对啦，这就对啦。”费金说道，“这对我们继续走下去很有帮助。这道门至关重要。我们经过那些绞刑架的时候，如果我摇摇晃晃或是哆哆嗦嗦，你别管我，只管走。快，快，快！”","“That’s right, that’s right,” said Fagin.“That’s ll help us on.This door first. If I shake and tremble, as we pass the gallows, don’t you mind, but hurry on.Now, now, now!”"
"“您没有什么别的要问他了吗，先生？”狱警问道。","“Have you nothing else to ask him, sir?”  inquired the turnkey."
"“没别的问题了。”布朗洛先生答道，“我本以为可以让他看清自己的处境——”“事已至此，无法挽回了，先生。”狱警摇了摇头，说道，“您最好还是别管他了。”","“No other question,” replied Mr. Brownlow.“If I hoped we could recall him to a sense of his position—” “Nothing will do that, sir,” replied the man, shaking his head.“You had better leave him.”"
"牢门打开了，两名看守回来了。","The door of the cell opened, and the attendants returned."
"“加把劲儿，加把劲儿。”费金大声喊道，“手脚轻点儿，但也别太慢。快点，快点！”","“Press on, press on,” cried Fagin.“Softly, but not so slow.Faster, faster!”"
"几个男人用手按住费金，帮奥利弗从他手中挣脱出来，然后又将他拽了回去。费金拼命地挣扎了一下，接着又开始放声嚎叫，那一声又一声的哀嚎甚至穿透了无比厚重的墙壁。直到他们回到露天大院，那叫声仍在他们耳边回响。","The men laid hands upon him, and disengaging Oliver from his grasp, held him back.He struggled with the power of desperation, for an instant; and then sent up cry upon cry that penetrated even those massive walls, and rang in their ears until they reached the open yard."
"他们又在监狱里逗留了一会儿才离去。看到这可怕的场面，奥利弗几欲昏厥。之后的一个小时甚至更长时间，他都非常虚弱，连走路的力气都没有。","It was some time before they left the prison.Oliver nearly swooned after this frightful scene, and was so weak that for an hour or more, he had not the strength to walk."
"他们再次出现的时候，已是黎明时分。一大群人已聚集在这里。窗户旁挤满了人，他们抽着烟、打着牌，以此来消磨时间。人们相互推搡着、争吵着、说笑着。一切都显得那样生机勃勃，但人群中央有一堆黑乎乎的东西——黑色的台子、十字架、绞索以及其他所有可怕的死刑刑具。","Day was dawning when they again emerged.A great multitude had already assembled; the windows were filled with people, smoking and playing cards to beguile the time; the crowd were pushing, quarrelling, joking.Everything told of life and animation, but one dark cluster of objects in the centre of all—the black stage, the cross-beam, the rope, and all the hideous apparatus of death."
"第五十三章 大结局","CHAPTER LIII And last "
"凡是这个故事中出现过的人物，其命运基本都已经讲完。他们的传奇故事已近尾声，作者会简而言之。","The fortunes of those who have figured in this tale are nearly closed.The little that remains to their historian to relate, is told in few and simple words."
"不到三个月，罗丝·弗莱明就与哈里·梅莱在村里的教堂结婚了，这个教堂也正是这位年轻牧师以后工作的地方。同一天，他们搬进了充满幸福的新居。","Before three months had passed, Rose Fleming and Harry Maylie were married in the village church which was henceforth to be the scene of the young clergyman’s labours; on the same day they entered into possession of their new and happy home."
"梅莱夫人搬来与儿子、儿媳同住；她安度晚年，享受着经过岁月沉淀、品德淬炼过的最美好的幸福。这幸福便是体味孩子们的幸福，永不停息地给予他们最温暖、最无微不至的关爱，让自己此生充满意义。","Mrs. Maylie took up her abode with her son and daughter-in-law, to enjoy, during the tranquil remainder of her days, the greatest felicity that age and worth can know—the contemplation of the happiness of those on whom the warmest affections and tenderest cares of a well-spent life, have been unceasingly bestowed."
"经过全面细致的调查，他们发现，如果将蒙克斯手上还残存的那部分遗产（这笔遗产从没有在蒙克斯或他母亲手里增过值）平均分给他自己和奥利弗，则每人可拿到三千英镑出头。根据他父亲的遗愿，奥利弗将继承全部遗产，但布朗洛先生不愿剥夺那家长子弃恶从善的机会，于是提出了上述的分配方式，那个由他监护的孩子欣然接受了这一提议。","It appeared, on full and careful investigation, that if the wreck of property remaining in the custody of Monks (which had never prospered either in his hands or in those of his mother) were equally divided between himself and Oliver, it would yield, to each, little more than three thousand pounds.By the provisions of his father’s will, Oliver would have been entitled to the whole; but Mr. Brownlow, unwilling to deprive the elder son of the opportunity of retrieving his former vices and pursuing an honest career, proposed this mode of distribution, to which his young charge joyfully acceded."
"蒙克斯仍旧用他的假名，带着他得到的那笔遗产，退隐到了新大陆一个偏远的地方。没过多久，他便把钱挥霍殆尽，只能重操旧业。结果，他因为诈骗而被判处长期监禁，最终旧病复发，死在狱中。至于他的朋友费金那一伙人，还剩下的几个主要成员也都客死异乡。","Monks, still bearing that assumed name, retired with his portion to a distant part of the New World; where, having quickly squandered it, he once more fell into his old courses, and, after undergoing a long confinement for some fresh act of fraud and knavery, at length sunk under an attack of his old disorder, and died in prison.As far from home, died the chief remaining members of his friend Fagin’s gang."
"布朗洛先生收养奥利弗为养子。他带着奥利弗和老管家移居到离牧师家，也就是他的好朋友梅莱夫妇家，不足一英里的地方。这样，他便满足了奥利弗那颗温暖真挚的心中剩下的唯一愿望。一个小社会就这样连接而成，它几乎拥有这个瞬息万变的世界中有史以来最完美的幸福。","Mr. Brownlow adopted Oliver as his son.Removing with him and the old housekeeper to within a mile of the parsonage-house, where his dear friends resided, he gratified the only remaining wish of Oliver’s warm and earnest heart, and thus linked together a little society, whose condition approached as nearly to one of perfect happiness as can ever be known in this changing world."
"两个年轻人婚后不久，那位德高望重的医生便回到了彻特西。在那里，他没有了老朋友的陪伴。如果他生性是爱发牢骚或易于暴躁之人，在那种情况下,他早就牢骚满腹、暴跳如雷了。有那么两三个月，他一直自我宽慰，暗示自己这边的空气恐怕已经开始不适合他了。随后，他发现这个地方的确不再适合他居住，他就把生意交给了助手，在哈里当牧师的村外租了间单身汉住的小屋，一切不如意瞬间消散。他在那里种植花木、钓鱼、做木工，还热衷于其他各种各样类似的消遣。但无论做什么，他总会带上那种风风火火的急躁性格。从那时起，他在各个方面都逐渐成为了见解最为深刻的权威，名气在附近流传了开来。","Soon after the marriage of the young people, the worthy doctor returned to Chertsey, where, bereft of the presence of his old friends, he would have been discontented if his temperament had admitted of such a feeling; and would have turned quite peevish if he had known how.For two or three months, he contented himself with hinting that he feared the air began to disagree with him; then, finding that the place really no longer was, to him, what it had been, he settled his business on his assistant, took a bachelor’s cottage outside the village of which his young friend was pastor, and instantaneously recovered.Here he took to gardening, planting, fishing, carpentering, and various other pursuits of a similar kind: all undertaken with his characteristic impetuosity.In each and all he has since become famous throughout the neighborhood, as a most profound authority."
"他在离开前，就已经成功地和格林维格先生结下了深厚的友情，而那位性情古怪的绅士也真诚地视他为知己。因此在这一年中，格林维格先生多次拜访他。每次到访，格林维格先生都会热情高涨地种植花草、钓鱼、做木工。他做什么都别具一格、独辟蹊径，还总是用他最喜欢的格言来证明自己的方法是对的。每逢礼拜天，他总是要当着年轻牧师的面评价一番布道，事后又总会神秘万分地告诉罗斯伯力先生，其实牧师讲得非常好，只不过他觉得不能直说罢了。布朗洛先生把这事当成他最喜欢的一个笑话，还经常用这事来取笑格林维格先生原先关于奥利弗的预言，并以此来提醒他,有那么一个晚上，他们把一只怀表放在两人中间，坐等奥利弗回来。但格林维格先生坚持自己大体上是对的，并称那晚奥利弗没有回来就是证据。他这么说时自己都会哈哈大笑，心情也会更加愉悦。","Before his removal, he had managed to contract a strong friendship for Mr. Grimwig, which that eccentric gentleman cordially reciprocated.He is accordingly visited by Mr. Grimwig a great many times in the course of the year.On all such occasions, Mr. Grimwig plants, fishes, and carpenters, with great ardour; doing everything in a very singular and unprecedented manner, but always maintaining with his favourite asseveration, that his mode is the right one.On Sundays, he never fails to criticise the sermon to the young clergyman’s face: always informing Mr. Losberne, in strict confidence afterwards, that he considers it an excellent performance, but deems it as well not to say so.It is a standing and very favourite joke, for Mr. Brownlow to rally him on his old prophecy concerning Oliver, and to remind him of the night on which they sat with the watch between them, waiting his return;but Mr. Grimwig contends that he was right in the main, and, in proof thereof, remarks that Oliver did not come back after all; which always calls forth a laugh on his side, and increases his good humour."
"诺亚·克雷波尔先生因为告发费金而得到皇室的赦免。他觉得自己的职业不像期望中那样安全，但是在短时间内，他又找不到一份不用太过劳累的营生。经过一番思量，他觉得告密是个上等并能糊口的营生，于是投身此行。他计划用每周做礼拜的时间，由夏洛特陪同，穿着体面地出去转转。这位女士走到那些心肠慈悲的酒店老板门口，就会晕厥过去。这位绅士就会向店老板要几便士的白兰地把她救醒。第二天他就会去告发酒店老板，并私吞一半的罚款。有时候，克雷波尔先生自己昏倒，但结果是一样的。","Mr. Noah Claypole: receiving a free pardon from the Crown in consequence of being admitted approver against Fagin: and considering his profession not altogether as safe a one as he could wish: was, for some little time, at a loss for the means of a livelihood, not burdened with too much work.After some consideration, he went into business as an Informer, in which calling he realises a genteel subsistence.His plan is, to walk out once a week during church time attended by Charlotte in respectable attire.The lady faints away at the doors of charitable publicans, and the gentleman being accommodated with three-penny worth of brandy to restore her, lays an information next day, and pockets half the penalty.Sometimes Mr. Claypole faints himself, but the result is the same."
"邦布尔夫妇被撤职后，变得穷困潦倒，最后在那家他们原来呼风唤雨的济贫院当起了贫民，过上了被救济的生活。听说邦布尔先生时运不济，境况日益窘迫，连感谢上帝将他和他老婆分开的精力都没有了。","Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, deprived of their situations, were gradually reduced to great indigence and misery, and finally became paupers in that very same workhouse in which they had once lorded it over others.Mr. Bumble has been heard to say, that in this reverse and degradation, he has not even spirits to be thankful for being separated from his wife."
"贾尔斯先生和布里特尔斯仍任原职，尽管前者谢了顶，布里特尔斯这个大男孩的头发也已灰白。他们住在牧师家里，但是他们对牧师一家、奥利弗、布朗洛先生，以及罗斯伯力先生同等地热心照料。这让村民们到今天都分不清他们到底是哪家的仆人。","As to Mr. Giles and Brittles, they still remain in their old posts, although the former is bald, and the last-named boy quite grey.They sleep at the parsonage, but divide their attentions so equally among its inmates, and Oliver and Mr. Brownlow, and Mr. Losberne, that to this day the villagers have never been able to discover to which establishment they properly belong."
"查尔斯·贝茨少爷看到赛克斯犯下的罪行，心中很受触动。他开始了一系列的思考，考虑诚实做人究竟是不是最好的选择。他得出了肯定的答案，于是洗心革面，决心在新的行当里采取行动，修正往昔的错误。他曾一度拼命奋斗，吃了很多苦头，但因为他生性容易满足，且一心向善，他最终取得了成功。他为农夫做过苦工，给搬运工打过下手，现在成了北安普敦郡最快乐的年轻放牧人。","Master Charles Bates, appalled by Sikes’s crime, fell into a train of reflection whether an honest life was not, after all, the best.Arriving at the conclusion that it certainly was, he turned his back upon the scenes of the past, resolved to amend it in some new sphere of action.He struggled hard, and suffered much, for some time; but, having a contented disposition, and a good purpose, succeeded in the end; and, from being a farmer’s drudge, and a carrier’s lad, he is now the merriest young grazier in all Northamptonshire."
"现在，讲述这些事情的笔者，随着故事临近尾声，下笔有些迟疑。我想要以这些传奇故事为线为引，再编织出些许篇幅来。","And now, the hand that traces these words, falters, as it approaches the conclusion of its task; and would weave, for a little longer space, the thread of these adventures."
"尽管我与书中的几个人物相处多时，但我仍愿意同他们再多呆一会儿。我要努力描绘他们的快乐，来分享他们的幸福。我要让罗丝·梅莱拥有少妇的风华正茂和优雅神韵，将柔和细腻的光芒撒向她那条人生的幽径，撒向与她同行的人，一直照到他们心中。我要描绘她冬日围炉的快乐生活和夏日欢聚的蓬勃朝气。中午，我要随她穿过闷热的田间；月夜，我要听她漫步时用甜美的嗓音低声吟唱；我要看她在外行善为乐，在家笑容满面，孜孜不倦地管理内务。我要描绘她与她姐姐的遗孤相亲相爱，无比幸福；他们常常会用几个小时的时间来勾勒他们痛失的朋友们。我要再次把围坐在她膝旁的那些快乐的小脸蛋们唤到我跟前，听他们快活地闲聊。我要重拾记忆中那爽朗的笑声，那柔情似水的蓝眼睛里闪烁的同情之泪。这一切，这千百张面孔，这千百次微笑；我愿意唤醒对这一切的记忆。","I would fain linger yet with a few of those among whom I have so long moved, and share their happiness by endeavouring to depict it.I would show Rose Maylie in all the bloom and grace of early womanhood, shedding on her secluded path in life soft and gentle light, that fell on all who trod it with her, and shone into their hearts.I would paint her the life and joy of the fire-side circle and the lively summer group; I would follow her through the sultry fields at noon, and hear the low tones of her sweet voice in the moonlit evening walk; I would watch her in all her goodness and charity abroad, and the smiling untiring discharge of domestic duties at home;I would paint her and her dead sister’s child happy in their love for one another, and passing whole hours together in picturing the friends whom they had so sadly lost; I would summon before me, once again, those joyous little faces that clustered round her knee, and listen to their merry prattle;I would recall the tones of that clear laugh, and conjure up the sympathising tear that glistened in the soft blue eye.These, and a thousand looks and smiles, and turns of thought and speech—I would fain recall them every one."
"日复一日，布朗洛先生不断丰富着奥利弗的学识，与他情感上的联系也愈加深厚。他的本性逐渐自然发展起来，潜藏的种子正向着布朗洛先生期望的方向茁壮成长——他在奥利弗身上寻找着黎福特这位老友以前不为他所知的特征。这些唤起了他内心深处的回忆，虽然哀伤，却又幸福欣慰。这两个孤儿怎样历经磨难，懂得如何宽厚待人、相亲相爱，又对一直保护他们的布朗洛先生心存怎样的感激——这些都是不言自明的。我说过，他们真的很幸福。但如果他们没有深沉的爱与仁慈之心，对慈悲为怀、普渡众生的上帝又不知感恩，是不可能得到幸福的。","How Mr. Brownlow went on, from day to day, filling the mind of his adopted child with stores of knowledge, and becoming attached to him, more and more, as his nature developed itself, and showed the thriving seeds of all he wished him to become—how he traced in him new traits of his early friend,that awakened in his own bosom old remembrances, melancholy and yet sweet and soothing—how the two orphans, tried by adversity, remembered its lessons in mercy to others, and mutual love, and fervent thanks to Him who had protected and preserved them—these are all matters which need not to be told.I have said that they were truly happy; and without strong affection and humanity of heart, and gratitude to that Being whose code is Mercy, and whose great attribute is Benevolence to all things that breathe, happiness can never be attained."
"在乡村旧教堂的祭坛里，立着一个白色大理石碑，上面仅刻有一个名字：“阿格尼丝”。墓穴里没有棺材，但也许很多年以后，另一个名字也会出现在石碑上！如果死者的灵魂能够返回人间，游访这一处处爱的圣地——那是超越生死的爱——那是来自死者生前好友的爱。我想，阿格尼丝的魂魄会时常游荡在这神圣的角落里。我仍然相信她会回来，因为那角落在教堂里，而她又曾是那么的脆弱不堪，自感铸成了大错。","Within the altar of the old village church there stands a white marble tablet, which bears as yet but one word: “AGNES.”There is no coffin in that tomb; and may it be many, many years, before another name is placed above it!But, if the spirits of the Dead ever come back to earth, to visit spots hallowed by the love—the love beyond the grave—of those whom they knew in life, I believe that the shade of Agnes sometimes hovers round that solemn nook.I believe it none the less because that nook is in a Church, and she was weak and erring."
