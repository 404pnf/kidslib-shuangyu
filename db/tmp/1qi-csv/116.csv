"现在几点了？","What o’clock is it?"
"——古谚语","—Old Saying."
"一般情况下，每个人都知道世界上最美好的地方是——或者，唉，曾经是——荷兰的维奥德沃特米提斯自治镇。然而因为它远离任何一条主干道，所在的地方有点偏僻，我的读者当中可能很少有人去过那里。为了方便那些没有去过该地的人，我很有必要对它做一番描述。的确，为了赢得公众对当地人的同情，在此，我打算讲一下最近发生在这个地方的灾难性事件，因此描述这里就更有必要了。认识我的人都毫不怀疑，我会持以严格公正的态度，无比谨慎地调查事实，坚持不懈地核对典据，竭尽所能地完成我自愿承担的义务。这些特点会使那些立志要获得历史学家称号的人脱颖而出。","Everybody knows, in a general way, that the finest place in the world is—or, alas, was—the Dutch borough of Vondervotteimittiss.Yet as it lies some distance from any of the main roads, being in a somewhat out-of-the-way situation, there are perhaps very few of my readers who have ever paid it a visit.For the benefit of those who have not, therefore, it will be only proper that I should enter into some account of it.And this is indeed the more necessary, as with the hope of enlisting public sympathy in behalf of the inhabitants, I design here to give a history of the calamitous events which have so lately occurred within its limits.No one who knows me will doubt that the duty thus self-imposed will be executed to the best of my ability, with all that rigid impartiality, all that cautious examination into facts, and diligent collation of authorities, which should ever distinguish him who aspires to the title of historian."
"在奖章、手稿和铭文的共同佐证下，我可以断定维奥德沃特米提斯自治镇从建立之初至今一直精确地保持着相同的风貌。然而，关于它建立的日期，很遗憾我只能采用那种近似精确的话语来表述，也就是数学家们有时为了套用某个数学公式不得已而采取的方法。我可以这样说，从这个城镇的历史之久远来看，这个日期不会比有据可查的任何年代更晚了。","By the united aid of medals, manuscripts, and inscriptions, I am enabled to say, positively, that the borough of Vondervotteimittiss has existed, from its origin, in precisely the same condition which it at present preserves.Of the date of this origin, however, I grieve that I can only speak with that species of indefinite definiteness which mathematicians are, at times, forced to put up with in certain algebraic formulae.The date, I may thus say, in regard to the remoteness of its antiquity, cannot be less than any assignable quantity whatsoever."
"关于维奥德沃特米提斯名字的由来，我懊恼地承认，我同样感到迷惑不解。人们对这个微妙的问题有许多不同的见解——有的犀利，有的深刻，有的却截然相反——我却不能找到一个令人满意的看法。也许格罗斯韦格的想法——几乎和克劳特普兰特的想法不谋而合——人们应该还算比较认同。这就是——维奥德沃特米提斯——维奥德，接近德语中“雷鸣”这个词的发音——沃特米提斯，接近德语“好像是闪电之前”的发音。说实话，镇议会大厅尖塔顶部电击的迹象进一步证实了这种推理。可是，我不打算在如此重大的问题上表明立场。若读者欲了解更多信息，我建议他们参考邓德古茨的《旁敲侧击先辈演讲集》。也要看看布伦德巴泽德的《词源说》中的第27页至5010页。这书是哥特体对开本，红黑字体，有导字，无密码索引；还可以参考斯图夫特朴夫手稿上的旁注和格鲁特古扎尔的点评。","Touching the derivation of the name Vondervotteimittiss, I confess myself, with sorrow, equally at fault.Among a multitude of opinions upon this delicate point—some acute, some learned, some sufficiently the reverse—I am able to select nothing which ought to be considered satisfactory.Perhaps the idea of Grogswigg—nearly coincident with that of Kroutaplenttey—is to be cautiously preferred.—It runs:—“Vondervotteimittis—Vonder, lege Donder—Votteimittis, quasi und Bleitziz—Bleitziz obsol:—pro Blitzen.”This derivative, to say the truth, is still countenanced by some traces of the electric fluid evident on the summit of the steeple of the House of the Town-Council.I do not choose, however, to commit myself on a theme of such importance, and must refer the reader desirous of information to the “Oratiunculae de Rebus Praeter-Veteris,” of Dundergutz.See, also, Blunderbuzzard “De Derivationibus,” pp. 27 to 5010, Folio, Gothic edit., Red and Black character, Catch-word and No Cypher; wherein consult, also, marginal notes in the autograph of Stuffundpuff, with the Sub-Commentaries of Gruntundguzzell."
"尽管人们对维奥德沃特米提斯自治镇建立的时间及其名字的来源尚不清楚，但是毋庸置疑，如我前面所述，它一直以我们目前发现它的样子存在着。在镇上，最年老的人也记不得它外观上有丝毫的变化。的确，话中一提到这种可能性都会被看作是一种冒犯。村庄坐落在一个完美的圆形山谷中，周长大约四分之一英里，周围全是和缓的山峦，当地人还从来不敢冒险跨过这些山峰。为此，他们有个非常充分的理由，那就是他们完全不相信山的另一边有任何东西。","Notwithstanding the obscurity which thus envelops the date of the foundation of Vondervotteimittiss, and the derivation of its name, there can be no doubt, as I said before, that it has always existed as we find it at this epoch.The oldest man in the borough can remember not the slightest difference in the appearance of any portion of it; and, indeed, the very suggestion of such a possibility is considered an insult.The site of the village is in a perfectly circular valley, about a quarter of a mile in circumference, and entirely surrounded by gentle hills, over whose summit the people have never yet ventured to pass.For this they assign the very good reason that they do not believe there is anything at all on the other side."
"六十座小房屋排成一排，延绵不断地延伸开来，环绕在山谷边缘（山谷地势平坦，全铺着平整的砖）。这些房屋，背靠群山，自然就面向了平原中心。中心与每户人家的前门相隔恰好六十码。每家房前都有一个小花园，花园里有一条环形小径，一个日晷和二十四棵卷心菜。这些房屋都如此惊人地相似，以至于人们无法把它们一一区分开来。因为年代太过久远，所以建筑风格有点古怪，但房屋那令人惊艳的美景并不会因此而逊色。房屋是用烈火烧制的黑边红砖建成，因此墙看起来就像一个巨大的棋盘。山形墙朝前。其上的檐口跟房屋其他部分一样大，搭在屋檐和大门上。窗户窄又深，内嵌着细小的窗格和很多窗框。屋顶上铺了大量翘起的长檐角瓦片。房屋的木制部分通体颜色深暗，上面有很多雕刻，但图案的样式变化很小。因为很久以来，维奥德沃特米提斯的雕刻匠们就只会雕刻两种东西——计时器和卷心菜。但是这两样东西他们雕刻得极其精致，凡落凿之处，他们都独具匠心地加以点缀。","Round the skirts of the valley (which is quite level, and paved throughout with flat tiles), extends a continuous row of sixty little houses.These, having their backs on the hills, must look, of course, to the centre of the plain, which is just sixty yards from the front door of each dwelling.Every house has a small garden before it, with a circular path, a sun-dial, and twenty-four cabbages.The buildings themselves are so precisely alike, that one can in no manner be distinguished from the other.Owing to the vast antiquity, the style of architecture is somewhat odd, but it is not for that reason the less strikingly picturesque.They are fashioned of hard-burned little bricks, red, with black ends, so that the walls look like a chess-board upon a great scale.The gables are turned to the front, and there are cornices, as big as all the rest of the house, over the eaves and over the main doors.The windows are narrow and deep, with very tiny panes and a great deal of sash.On the roof is a vast quantity of tiles with long curly ears.The woodwork, throughout, is of a dark hue and there is much carving about it, with but a trifling variety of pattern for, time out of mind, the carvers of Vondervotteimittiss have never been able to carve more than two objects—a time-piece and a cabbage.But these they do exceedingly well, and intersperse them, with singular ingenuity, wherever they find room for the chisel."
"房屋的内部与外部都如出一辙，家具摆设也都一个样式。地面铺着方砖。黑色木制桌椅腿细而弯曲，桌椅脚呈小狗爪状。又高又宽的壁炉架不仅正面雕刻着计时器和卷心菜，而且顶部正中间还摆放着一个真的计时器，“滴答滴答”地响得异常响亮；两端各有一个花盆，每个花盆里面栽着一棵卷心菜，像侍从一样站在两端。在每棵卷心菜和计时器之间还有一个大肚子的小中国人。透过他肚子上那个又大又圆的洞，人可以看见表的表盘。","The dwellings are as much alike inside as out, and the furniture is all upon one plan.The floors are of square tiles, the chairs and tables of black-looking wood with thin crooked legs and puppy feet.The mantelpieces are wide and high, and have not only time-pieces and cabbages sculptured over the front, but a real time-piece, which makes a prodigious ticking, on the top in the middle, with a flower-pot containing a cabbage standing on each extremity by way of outrider.Between each cabbage and the time-piece, again, is a little China man having a large stomach with a great round hole in it, through which is seen the dial-plate of a watch."
"壁炉又大又深，里面的柴架弯弯曲曲、异常可怖。壁炉里火势总是很旺，上面放着一口大锅，里面煮着满满一锅的泡菜和猪肉，勤劳的家庭主妇总是忙着料理它们。她是个矮胖的老太太，长着一双蓝眼睛，有着一张红扑扑的脸，戴着一顶圆锥形糖块式样的大帽子，上面饰有紫色和黄色丝带。她穿着一件亚麻羊毛混纺料子的橙色连衣裙，后面有许多褶皱，腰部的剪裁很短——从其他角度看也确实很短，衣服还不到她大腿中部。她的腿很粗，脚踝也一样。但是她穿着一双漂亮的绿长袜，把双腿都遮住了。她的鞋——用粉色皮革制成——每只都用一束黄色丝带系成卷心菜状。她左手拿着一支小而沉的荷兰手表；右手持一个勺子，搅拌着锅里的泡菜和猪肉。她的旁边站着一只胖乎乎的虎斑猫，尾巴上系着一个镀金的玩具打簧表。这是“小伙子们”搞恶作剧系上去的。","The fireplaces are large and deep, with fierce crooked-looking fire-dogs.There is constantly a rousing fire, and a huge pot over it, full of sauerkraut and pork, to which the good woman of the house is always busy in attending.She is a little fat old lady, with blue eyes and a red face, and wears a huge cap like a sugar-loaf, ornamented with purple and yellow ribbons.Her dress is of orange-colored linsey-woolsey, made very full behind and very short in the waist—and indeed very short in other respects, not reaching below the middle of her leg.This is somewhat thick, and so are her ankles, but she has a fine pair of green stockings to cover them.Her shoes—of pink leather—are fastened each with a bunch of yellow ribbons puckered up in the shape of a cabbage.In her left hand she has a little heavy Dutch watch; in her right she wields a ladle for the sauerkraut and pork.By her side there stands a fat tabby cat, with a gilt toy-repeater tied to its tail, which “the boys” have there fastened by way of a quiz."
"三个小伙子都在花园里喂猪。每个人都身高两英尺。他们头戴高翘的三角帽，上穿长及大腿的紫色马甲，下身是齐膝的鹿皮马裤，红色长筒袜，缀有银色大纽扣的大头鞋，外面套着一件紧身长外套，上面镶着珍珠母大纽扣。每个人嘴里还叼着烟斗，右手拿着一个笨重的小手表。他们吐一口烟，看一眼表，然后再吐一口烟，再看看表。猪——又肥又懒——正忙着捡食卷心菜上的落叶，不时地踢着后面的镀金打簧表。那是调皮鬼们系在它尾巴上的，为了使它看上去和猫一样漂亮。","The boys themselves are, all three of them, in the garden attending the pig.They are each two feet in height.They have three-cornered cocked hats, purple waistcoats reaching down to their thighs, buckskin knee-breeches, red stockings, heavy shoes with big silver buckles, long surtout coats with large buttons of mother-of-pearl.Each, too, has a pipe in his mouth, and a little dumpy watch in his right hand.He takes a puff and a look, and then a look and a puff.The pig—which is corpulent and lazy—is occupied now in picking up the stray leaves that fall from the cabbages, and now in giving a kick behind at the gilt repeater, which the urchins have also tied to his tail in order to make him look as handsome as the cat."
"正门门口，有一把高背扶手椅，上有皮革垫子，还有像桌子一样弯曲的椅腿和小狗爪一样的椅脚，上面坐着一个老头子，是这个房子的主人。他是一个超级胖的小老头，有着圆溜溜的大眼睛，肥肥的双下巴。他的穿着跟小伙子们很相似——我在此就不多费口舌了。只有一点不同，他的烟斗比他们的稍微大一些，吐出的烟圈也要大一些。与他们一样，他也有一块手表。不过，他把他的手表装在了他的口袋里。老实说，他有比查看手表更重要的事情要做——是什么呢，这就是我现在要讲的。他右腿放在左膝上，表情严肃地坐在那里，总是至少用其中一只眼睛紧紧盯着平原中心一样比较显眼的东西。","Right at the front door, in a high-backed leather-bottomed armed chair, with crooked legs and puppy feet like the tables, is seated the old man of the house himself.He is an exceedingly puffy little old gentleman, with big circular eyes and a huge double chin.His dress resembles that of the boys—and I need say nothing farther about it.All the difference is, that his pipe is somewhat bigger than theirs and he can make a greater smoke.Like them, he has a watch, but he carries his watch in his pocket.To say the truth, he has something of more importance than a watch to attend to—and what that is, I shall presently explain.He sits with his right leg upon his left knee, wears a grave countenance, and always keeps one of his eyes, at least, resolutely bent upon a certain remarkable object in the centre of the plain."
"这样东西位于镇议会厅的尖塔上。镇议会的议员都是一些矮小肥胖、油光满面、头脑聪明的先生们。他们长着圆圆的大眼睛和肥硕的双下巴。跟维奥德沃特米提斯自治镇的普通居民相比，他们的外衣更长，鞋扣也要更大些。我在此逗留期间，他们开了好几次特别会议，通过了以下三个重要的决定：","This object is situated in the steeple of the House of the Town Council.The Town Council are all very little, round, oily, intelligent men, with big saucer eyes and fat double chins, and have their coats much longer and their shoe-buckles much bigger than the ordinary inhabitants of Vondervotteimittiss.Since my sojourn in the borough, they have had several special meetings, and have adopted these three important resolutions:"
"“改变事物原有的正常规律是错误的。”","“That it is wrong to alter the good old course of things:”"
"“在维奥德沃特米提斯自治镇之外的地方，一切都不可容忍”——","“That there is nothing tolerable out of Vondervotteimittiss:” and—"
"“我们将固守我们的钟表和我们的卷心菜。” ","“That we will stick by our clocks and our cabbages.”"
"在议会会议厅上方是尖塔，钟楼就在尖塔里面。那里有、并且很久以前就有了村庄的骄傲和奇迹——维奥德沃特米提斯自治镇的大钟。这就是那些坐在皮革垫子扶手椅上的老头们眼睛所注视的东西。","Above the session-room of the Council is the steeple, and in the steeple is the belfry, where exists, and has existed time out of mind, the pride and wonder of the village—the great clock of the borough of Vondervotteimittiss.And this is the object to which the eyes of the old gentlemen are turned who sit in the leather-bottomed arm-chairs."
"大钟有七面——每一面占七面尖塔中的一面——因此，人们可以从各个方位、很容易地看到它。它的钟面又大又白，它的指针又沉又黑。看钟人唯一的职责就是照看它。然而，这个职务是一个完完全全的闲差——因为人们还从未听说过维奥德沃特米提斯自治镇的钟出过什么毛病。直到现在，仅仅是如此假设一下都会被看作是一种异端邪说。从有据可考的、最久远的年代开始，这口大钟就一直准时地敲响。确实，镇上其他所有的时钟和手表也和它一样按时报时。世界上还没见过一个这么恪守时间的地方。当钟锤认为是报“十二点！”的时候了，所有顺从的追随者会同时张开喉咙，就像回声一样回应着。总之，善良的镇民们喜欢他们的泡菜，但是他们引以为豪的却是钟表。","The great clock has seven faces—one in each of the seven sides of the steeple—so that it can be readily seen from all quarters.Its faces are large and white, and its hands heavy and black.There is a belfry-man whose sole duty is to attend to it; but this duty is the most perfect of sinecures—for the clock of Vondervotteimittiss was never yet known to have anything the matter with it.Until lately, the bare supposition of such a thing was considered heretical.From the remotest period of antiquity to which the archives have reference, the hours have been regularly struck by the big bell.And, indeed the case was just the same with all the other clocks and watches in the borough.Never was such a place for keeping the true time.When the large clapper thought proper to say “Twelve o’clock!” all its obedient followers opened their throats simultaneously, and responded like a very echo.In short, the good burghers were fond of their sauerkraut, but then they were proud of their clocks."
"所有有闲职的人都或多或少地受人尊重。维奥德沃特米提斯自治镇上的敲钟人拥有一份最完美的闲差，因此他是这个世界上最受尊重的人。他是这个镇上最显要的人物，连那些猪也用崇敬的神情仰视他。与镇上的其他老绅士相比，他外套的后摆要长很多——他的烟斗、他的鞋扣、他的眼睛和他的肚子也要大得多。他的下巴，已不只是两层，而是三层了。","All people who hold sinecure offices are held in more or less respect, and as the belfry-man of Vondervotteimittiss has the most perfect of sinecures, he is the most perfectly respected of any man in the world.He is the chief dignitary of the borough, and the very pigs look up to him with a sentiment of reverence.His coat-tail is very far longer—his pipe, his shoe-buckles, his eyes, and his stomach, very far bigger—than those of any other old gentleman in the village; and as to his chin, it is not only double, but triple."
"至此，我已经描绘了镇上欢快的情形，唉，如此美丽的景象竟然经历了一场颠覆！","I have thus painted the happy estate of Vondervotteimittiss: alas, that so fair a picture should ever experience a reverse!"
"很久以来，在最睿智的居民中间流传着这样一句话，“山那边不会出来什么好东西”。看来这句话真有种预言的意味。前天中午，差五分钟到十二点时，东面山脊顶上出现了一个看起来非常古怪的物体。当然，这件事引起了所有人的注意。坐在皮革垫子扶手椅上的每一个小老头都惊慌地用一只眼睛关注着这一现象，另一只眼睛仍旧盯着尖塔上的钟表。","There has been long a saying among the wisest inhabitants, that “no good can come from over the hills”; and it really seemed that the words had in them something of the spirit of prophecy.It wanted five minutes of noon, on the day before yesterday, when there appeared a very odd-looking object on the summit of the ridge of the eastward.Such an occurrence, of course, attracted universal attention, and every little old gentleman who sat in a leather-bottomed arm-chair turned one of his eyes with a stare of dismay upon the phenomenon, still keeping the other upon the clock in the steeple."
"只差三分钟就到十二点的时候，他们才弄明白，那个令人疑惑不解的古怪物原来是一个矮小的陌生年轻男子。他下山的速度极快，因此每个人很快便看清了他的模样。他确实是维奥德沃特米提斯自治镇上的人们所见过的最讲究的小人。他面部呈深黄褐色，长着一个长长的鹰钩鼻，一双豌豆眼，一张宽大的嘴巴和一副整齐洁白的牙齿。他咧嘴大笑，似乎是急于炫耀他的这口好牙。由于蓬松胡须和络腮胡子的遮掩，他脸上的其他部位就看不到了。他没戴帽子，头发用卷发纸处理得很整齐。他穿着紧身的黑色燕尾服（其中一个口袋悬着一条很长的白手帕），黑色克什米尔羊毛齐膝短裤，黑长袜，模样粗短的无带舞鞋，上面还系有一大堆蝴蝶结状的黑缎带。他一只胳膊下夹着一顶特大的三角帽，另一只胳膊下是一个几乎大他四倍的小提琴。他左手拿着一个金色鼻烟壶。当他欢呼雀跃地下山时，他边迈着大步，边不停地嗅着鼻烟，显出一副自我陶醉的样子。天啊！——这在维奥德沃特米提斯诚实的镇民来看，可真是个奇观！","By the time that it wanted only three minutes to noon, the droll object in question was perceived to be a very diminutive foreign-looking young man.He descended the hills at a great rate, so that every body had soon a good look at him.He was really the most finicky little personage that had ever been seen in Vondervotteimittiss.His countenance was of a dark snuff-color, and he had a long hooked nose, pea eyes, a wide mouth, and an excellent set of teeth, which latter he seemed anxious of displaying, as he was grinning from ear to ear.What with mustachios and whiskers, there was none of the rest of his face to be seen.His head was uncovered, and his hair neatly done up in papillotes.His dress was a tight-fitting swallow-tailed black coat (from one of whose pockets dangled a vast length of white handkerchief), black kerseymere knee-breeches, black stockings, and stumpy-looking pumps, with huge bunches of black satin ribbon for bows.Under one arm he carried a huge chapeau-de-bras, and under the other a fiddle nearly five times as big as himself.In his left hand was a gold snuff-box, from which, as he capered down the hill, cutting all manner of fantastic steps, he took snuff incessantly with an air of the greatest possible self-satisfaction.God bless me!—here was a sight for the honest burghers of Vondervotteimittiss!"
"坦率地说，尽管这个家伙咧着嘴笑，他还是表现出了一副放肆和险恶的神态。当他一蹦一跳地直奔村庄时，他那双破旧而粗短的无带舞鞋引起了人们不小的怀疑。他的白色麻布手帕从燕尾服的口袋里露出来很是显眼。那天看到他的许多人宁愿浪费一点时间，也想要窥视一下白手帕下藏着什么东西。但非常让人愤慨的是，这个无赖的花花公子，这儿一个西班牙舞步，那儿一个旋转舞步，好像根本就不晓得世界上还有要按节拍移动舞步的概念。","To speak plainly, the fellow had, in spite of his grinning, an audacious and sinister kind of face; and as he curvetted right into the village, the old stumpy appearance of his pumps excited no little suspicion; and many a burgher who beheld him that day would have given a trifle for a peep beneath the white cambric handkerchief which hung so obtrusively from the pocket of his swallow-tailed coat.But what mainly occasioned a righteous indignation was, that the scoundrelly popinjay, while he cut a fandango here, and a whirligig there, did not seem to have the remotest idea in the world of such a thing as keeping time in his steps."
"然而，当差半分就到十二点的时候，镇上善良的人们还没来得及完全睁开双眼，如我所说的，那个无赖就径直跳到了他们的中间。他这儿一个快滑步，那儿一个摇摆步，然后，一个脚尖旋转舞步，一个和风舞步，一个鸽翼舞步登上了镇议会大厅的钟楼上。惊讶不已的看钟人坐在里面，抽着烟，神情严肃而又恐慌。但是，这个小伙子立刻揪住他的鼻子，又是拧又是拽，把自己的大三角帽子罩在看钟人的头上，往下一拉，遮住了他的眼睛和嘴巴。然后，他又举起巨大的小提琴，朝看钟人打去。他打得时间很长，声音也很响亮，加上看钟人那么胖，小提琴中间又是空的，你肯定会以为，在维奥德沃特米提斯自治镇尖塔的钟楼里，有一个乐团的低音鼓手正在敲出魔鬼的喊叫声。","The good people of the borough had scarcely a chance, however, to get their eyes thoroughly open, when, just as it wanted half a minute of noon, the rascal bounced, as I say, right into the midst of them; gave a chassez here, and a balancez there; and then, after a pirouette and a pas-de-zephyr, pigeon-winged himself right up into the belfry of the House of the Town Council, where the wonder-stricken belfry-man sat smoking in a state of dignity and dismay.But the little chap seized him at once by the nose; gave it a swing and a pull; clapped the big chapeau de-bras upon his head; knocked it down over his eyes and mouth; and then, lifting up the big fiddle, beat him with it so long and so soundly, that what with the belfry-man being so fat, and the fiddle being so hollow, you would have sworn that there was a regiment of double-bass drummers all beating the devil’s tattoo up in the belfry of the steeple of Vondervotteimittiss."
"要不是现在就差半秒就到十二点这一重要事实，真不知道这种肆无忌惮的攻击在居民中会引起怎样激烈的报复行为。钟即将敲响，每个人应当仔细地看他的手表，这是一件绝对高于一切、十分必要的事情。但很显然，就在这个时候，在尖塔上的那个家伙正在做一些跟钟无关的事情。不过，当钟声此刻开始敲响时，谁也没有闲暇去留意他的一举一动。因为当它响起时，大家要数大钟敲响的次数。","There is no knowing to what desperate act of vengeance this unprincipled attack might have aroused the inhabitants, but for the important fact that it now wanted only half a second of noon.The bell was about to strike, and it was a matter of absolute and pre-eminent necessity that every body should look well at his watch.It was evident, however, that just at this moment the fellow in the steeple was doing something that he had no business to do with the clock.But as it now began to strike, nobody had any time to attend to his manoeuvres, for they had all to count the strokes of the bell as it sounded."
"“一！”大钟说。","“One!” said the clock."
"“一！”在维奥德沃特米提斯自治镇，每个坐在皮革垫子扶手椅上的小老头都随声附和着。“一！”他的手表也响了起来；“一！”他老伴的手表也响起来；“一！”小伙子们的手表和系在猫和猪尾巴上的小镀金打簧表响应着。","“Von!” echoed every little old gentleman in every leather-bottomed arm-chair in Vondervotteimittiss.“Von!” said his watch also; “von!” said the watch of his vrow; and “von!” said the watches of the boys, and the little gilt repeaters on the tails of the cat and pig."
"“二！”大钟继续敲着；","“Two!” continued the big bell; "
"“二！”所有的打簧表重复着。","and “Doo!” repeated all the repeaters."
"“三！四！五！六！七！八！九！十！”大钟说。","“Three!Four!Five!Six!Seven!Eight!Nine!Ten!” said the bell."
"“三！四！五！六！七！八！九！十！”其他人都回应着。","“Dree!Vour!Fibe!Sax!Seben!Aight!Noin!Den!” answered the others."
"“十一！”大钟说道。","“Eleven!” said the big one."
"“十一！”小钟表们异口同声地应着。","“Eleben!” assented the little ones."
"“十二！”大钟说。","“Twelve!” said the bell."
"“十二！”他们都心满意足地回答道，并压低了他们的声音。","“Dvelf!” they replied perfectly satisfied, and dropping their voices."
"“十二点了！”所有小老头们边说边把表收了起来。但是大钟并不就此罢休。","“Und dvelf it is!” said all the little old gentlemen, putting up their watches.But the big bell had not done with them yet."
"“十三！”他说道。","“Thirteen!” said he."
"“见鬼了！”小老头们喘着气，脸色变得苍白，丢掉了烟斗，把跷在左膝上的右腿放了下来。","“Der Teufel!” gasped the little old gentlemen, turning pale, dropping their pipes, and putting down all their right legs from over their left knees."
"“见鬼！”他们呻吟着，“十三！十三！！——天啊，现在十三点了！！”","“Der Teufel!” groaned they, “Dirteen!Dirteen!!—Mein Gott, it is Dirteen o’clock!!”"
"为什么试图去描述接下来发生的糟糕场面呢？所有维奥德沃特米提斯自治镇的人马上都陷入了一种可悲的骚动状态。","Why attempt to describe the terrible scene which ensued?All Vondervotteimittiss flew at once into a lamentable state of uproar."
"“我的肚子怎么办？”所有的男孩子吼叫着——“这时我已经饿了！”","“Vot is cum’d to mein pelly?” roared all the boys—“I’ve been ongry for dis hour!”"
"“我的泡菜怎么办？”所有的妇女都尖叫起来，“这个时候它已经煮烂了！”","“Vot is com’d to mein kraut?” screamed all the vrows, “It has been done to rags for this hour!”"
"“我的烟斗怎么办？”所有小老头咒骂道，“天打雷劈的！这个时候应该早抽完了！”——他们愤怒地又把烟斗塞满，坐回到他们的扶手椅上。他们快速而又猛烈地吐着烟圈，很快整个山谷就弥漫着浓浓的烟雾。","“Vot is cum’d to mein pipe?” swore all the little old gentlemen, “Donder and Blitzen; it has been smoked out for dis hour!”—and they filled them up again in a great rage, and sinking back in their arm-chairs, puffed away so fast and so fiercely that the whole valley was immediately filled with impenetrable smoke."
"同时所有的卷心菜外面也都变得很红，好像魔鬼撒旦已经控制了以计时器的形式现身的每个事物。雕刻在家具上的钟表仿佛被施了巫术似的跳起舞来。那些在壁炉架上的钟表更是控制不住自己的愤怒，不断地敲响，十三下又十三下。它们的钟摆如此欢快而又狂乱地摆动着，看起来确实很可怕。但更糟糕的是，猫和猪都再也不能忍受在它们尾巴上系小打簧表的行为了。为了发泄内心的怨恨，它们惊惶地乱跑，胡抓乱捅，不是吱吱乱叫就是尖声狂叫。猫叫春，猪嚎啕，迎面朝人撞去，跑到人们的衬裙下，制造出最令人讨厌的喧闹和混乱。这种场面，对于一个理智的人来说，是很容易想象到的。令人更加恼火的是，尖塔上的那个小无赖显然在尽情地显示自己。人们不时地可以从烟雾中瞥见那个坏家伙。他就在钟楼里，坐在平躺着的看钟人身上。那恶棍用牙齿咬着钟绳，不断地扭动着他的头，钟就响起了嘈杂的声音。我一想起来，耳边就会再次响起这种声音。他膝盖上放着巨大的小提琴。他双手拨着琴，不合拍也不合调，出尽了洋相，这个笨蛋！他弹的是《弗兰纳干的朱迪和拉弗尔蒂的帕蒂》。","Meantime the cabbages all turned very red in the face, and it seemed as if old Nick himself had taken possession of every thing in the shape of a timepiece.The clocks carved upon the furniture took to dancing as if bewitched, while those upon the mantel-pieces could scarcely contain themselves for fury, and kept such a continual striking of thirteen, and such a frisking and wriggling of their pendulums as was really horrible to see.But, worse than all, neither the cats nor the pigs could put up any longer with the behavior of the little repeaters tied to their tails, and resented it by scampering all over the place, scratching and poking, and squeaking and screeching, and caterwauling and squalling, and flying into the faces, and running under the petticoats of the people, and creating altogether the most abominable din and confusion which it is possible for a reasonable person to conceive.And to make matters still more distressing, the rascally little scape-grace in the steeple was evidently exerting himself to the utmost.Every now and then one might catch a glimpse of the scoundrel through the smoke.There he sat in the belfry upon the belfry-man, who was lying flat upon his back.In his teeth the villain held the bell-rope, which he kept jerking about with his head, raising such a clatter that my ears ring again even to think of it.On his lap lay the big fiddle, at which he was scraping, out of all time and tune, with both hands, making a great show, the nincompoop! of playing “Judy O’Flannagan and Paddy O’Rafferty.”"
"事情就是这样的不幸。我厌恶地离开了这个地方，现在向所有喜欢精准时间和优质泡菜的人寻求帮助。让我们组成一队人马向这个镇前进，驱走在尖塔上的那个矮家伙，恢复维奥德沃特米提斯自治镇的古老秩序。","Affairs being thus miserably situated, I left the place in disgust, and now appeal for aid to all lovers of correct time and fine kraut.Let us proceed in a body to the borough, and restore the ancient order of things in Vondervotteimittiss by ejecting that little fellow from the steeple."
