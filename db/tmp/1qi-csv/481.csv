"约翰·英格尔菲尔德的感恩节","John Inglefield' s Thanksgiving"
"作者：纳撒尼尔·霍桑","by Nathaniel Hawthorne"
"感恩节当晚，铁匠约翰·英格尔菲尔德坐在自己的扶手椅上，周围坐着的是刚刚一起在餐桌边过节的家人们。一家人绕着壁炉，围成一圈。熊熊的火光投射在他高大、结实的身躯上；轮廓粗犷的脸被照得红彤彤的，看上去就像刚从他的熔炉里取出的铁铸塑像的头像一样满面红光，而后这头像又被他的铁砧粗略地敲打出面部的五官。在约翰·英格尔菲尔德右手有一把空椅子。壁炉边的其他地方都围满了约翰一家人。大家都静静地坐着，看上去心情都格外愉悦。他们的身影在后面的墙上跳动着。其中一人是约翰的儿子。他一直在大学读书，现在在安多弗学习神学。还有一个是约翰十六岁的女儿。人们一见到她的模样，无不想起含苞待放的玫瑰花蕾。火边还剩下一人是罗伯特·穆尔，以前是约翰的学徒，但现在是他的伙计了。比起那个面色苍白、身材瘦长的书生，穆尔倒更像是约翰·英格尔菲尔德的亲生儿子。","On the evening of Thanksgiving day, John Inglefield, the blacksmith, sat in his elbow-chair, among those who had been keeping festival at his board.Being the central figure of the domestic circle, the fire threw its strongest light on his massive and sturdy frame, reddening his rough visage, so that it looked like the head of an iron statue, all aglow, from his own forge, and with its features rudely fashioned on his own anvil.At John Inglefield’s right hand was an empty chair.The other places round the hearth were filled by the members of the family, who all sat quietly, while, with a semblance of fantastic merriment, their shadows danced on the wall behind them.One of the group was John Inglefield’s son, who had been bred at college, and was now a student of theology at Andover.There was also a daughter of sixteen, whom nobody could look at without thinking of a rosebud almost blossomed.The only other person at the fireside was Robert Moore, formerly an apprentice of the blacksmith, but now his journeyman, and who seemed more like an own son of John Inglefield than did the pale and slender student."
"能在这屋檐下共度这个新英格兰节日的人，就只有这四位了。约翰右手边的空椅子是为了纪念他的妻子而留着的。上个感恩节后，死神便将她从他身边夺走了。丧偶的约翰满怀感情地将这把椅子放在自己身边，很少有人能从他粗犷的个性中发现这种情感。他时常向椅子那边瞥一眼，仿佛觉得冰冷的坟墓可能会把妻子送回到这欢乐的炉边，哪怕仅仅是一晚。他就这样珍惜着这份可贵的忧伤。然而，还有一件伤心事，他却想从心里抹去；可这是不可能做到的，于是他想将它深埋在心里，不让他人察觉到，也不让自己再想起。过去一年中，约翰家里又有一个人离开了他，但不是进了坟墓。不过，大家并没有为她也留一把空椅子。","Only these four had kept New England’s festival beneath that roof.The vacant chair at John Inglefield’s right hand was in memory of his wife, whom death had snatched from him since the previous Thanksgiving.With a feeling that few would have looked for in his rough nature, the bereaved husband had himself set the chair in its place next his own; and often did his eye glance thitherward, as if he deemed it possible that the cold grave might send back its tenant to the cheerful fireside, at least for that one evening.Thus did he cherish the grief that was dear to him.But there was another grief which he would fain have torn from his heart; or, since that could never be, have buried it too deep for others to behold, or for his own remembrance.Within the past year another member of his household had gone from him, but not to the grave.Yet they kept no vacant chair for her."
"约翰一家围坐在炉边，身影在身后的墙上跳动着。这时，外屋的大门开了，走廊上传来了轻盈的脚步声。随后，里屋的门闩也被手法熟练地打开了，一位少女走了进来，身穿一件带帽子的披风。她脱下披风，放在镜子前的桌子上。然后，她看了看围坐在炉火边的一家人，走上前去，坐在了约翰右手边的那把椅子上，仿佛那是特意为她留的。","While John Inglefield and his family were sitting round the hearth with the shadows dancing behind them on the wall, the outer door was opened, and a light footstep came along the passage.The latch of the inner door was lifted by sonic familiar hand, and a young girl came in, wearing a cloak and hood, which she took off, and laid on the table beneath the looking-glass.Then, after gazing a moment at the fireside circle, she approached, and took the seat at John Inglefield’s right hand, as if it had been reserved on purpose for her."
"“我终于回来了，爸爸。”她说，“我没能赶上您的感恩节晚餐，但还能陪您度过这一晚。”","“Here I am, at last, father,” said she.“You ate your Thanksgiving dinner without me, but I have come back to spend the evening with you.”"
"没错，她就是普鲁登斯·英格尔菲尔德。她的衣着还是那么文雅而整洁，跟以前她干完一天家务后常穿的衣服一样。她的头发在额前分开，发型简约而端庄，再适合她不过了。如果说她的脸颊刚才还是苍白的话，这会儿也在火光中变得健康红润了。虽说在她离家的几个月里，都是在内疚和声名狼藉中度过的，但那些日子并没有在她温柔的面容上留下任何痕迹。她的模样看起来没有丝毫改变，就好像是刚从父亲的炉火边离开了半小时一样；回来时，火焰熊熊燃烧，炉中的木柴依旧还是她离开时的木柴，。对于约翰来说，女儿和已故的妻子长得简直一模一样。他记得妻子第一次在他们自己的屋檐下过感恩节时，就是这副模样。因此，尽管本性严厉、粗鲁，约翰却不忍对他犯了错的女儿说一句重话，但也不想将她拥入怀中。","Yes, it was Prudence Inglefield.She wore the same neat and maidenly attire which she had been accustomed to put on when the household work was over for the day, and her hair was parted from her brow, in the simple and modest fashion that became her best of all.If her cheek might otherwise have been pale, yet the glow of the fire suffused it with a healthful bloom.If she had spent the many months of her absence in guilt and infamy, yet they seemed to have left no traces on her gentle aspect.She could not have looked less altered, had she merely stepped away from her father’s fireside for half an hour, and returned while the blaze was quivering upwards from the same brands that were burning at her departure.And to John Inglefield she was the very image of his buried wife, such as he remembered her on the first Thanksgiving which they had passed under their own roof.Therefore, though naturally a stern and rugged man, he could not speak unkindly to his sinful child, nor yet could he take her to his bosom."
"“欢迎回家，普鲁登斯，”约翰从余光里看看女儿，声音有些颤抖，“你妈妈要是见到你，会很高兴的，只是她已经离开我们四个月了。”","“You are welcome home, Prudence,” said he, glancing sideways at her, and his voice faltered.“Your mother would have rejoiced to see you, but she has been gone from us these four months.”"
"“我知道，爸爸，我知道，”普鲁登斯立即答道，“但我刚进来时，火光让我一时眼花，好像看到妈妈就坐在这把椅子上似的！”","“I know it, father, I know it,” replied Prudence, quickly.“And yet, when I first came in, my eyes were so dazzled by the firelight, that she seemed to be sitting in this very chair!”"
"这时，家里的其他人才开始从惊愕中回过神来，意识到这不是从坟墓里出来的鬼魂，也不是从他们清晰的记忆中产生出的幻觉，而是普鲁登斯，她本人。她的哥哥第二个向她表示问候。他走上前，满怀深情地伸出手，就像一个兄长应该做的那样；但他又不完全像个兄长，因为尽管他亲切友好，但他仍然是位神职人员；他对这个有罪的孩子说：","By this time the other members of the family had begun to recover from their surprise, and became sensible that it was no ghost from the grave, nor vision of their vivid recollections, but Prudence, her own self.Her brother was the next that greeted her.He advanced and held out his hand affectionately, as a brother should; yet not entirely like a brother, for, with all his kindness, he was still a clergyman, and speaking to a child of sin."
"“普鲁登斯妹妹，”他诚挚地说道，“我很高兴仁慈的主让你踏上归途，让我能最后跟你道别。妹妹，几周后，我将作为传教士出海，到太平洋遥远的岛屿上去。此生，我不能指望再见到任何一个我所爱的人的面孔了。啊，但愿我能越过坟墓见到他们所有人——你的脸庞，还有所有人的！”","“Sister Prudence,” said he, earnestly, “I rejoice that a merciful Providence hath turned your steps homeward, in time for me to bid you a last farewell.In a few weeks, sister, I am to sail as a missionary to the far islands of the Pacific.There is not one of these beloved faces that I shall ever hope to behold again on this earth.O, may I see all of them—yours and all—beyond the grave!”"
"少女的脸上掠过一丝阴影。","A shadow flitted across the girl’s countenance."
"“坟墓里漆黑一片，哥哥，”她有些慌张地把手从他手里抽出来，说道，“你得借着火光，再看我最后一眼。”","“The grave is very dark, brother,” answered she, withdrawing her hand somewhat hastily from his grasp.“You must look your last at me by the light of this fire.”"
"普鲁登斯的双胞胎妹妹——那朵和离家的少女长在同一根茎上的玫瑰花蕾——站在那儿凝视着普鲁登斯，恨不得扑进她的怀里，这样，或许彼此心灵的藤蔓可以再次交织在一起。起初，她还因悲伤和羞愧而感到拘谨，担心普鲁登斯变化太大，不会对自己的感情流露作出回应；或者担心她自己的纯洁会被失去贞洁的普鲁登斯看成是一种指责。然而，她听着这熟悉的声音，眼前的面孔也越来越亲切，于是她把这一切都抛在脑后，只知道普鲁登斯回来了。她冲了过去，本打算紧紧抱住普鲁登斯。但就在此刻，普鲁登斯从椅子上站了起来，伸出双手，做了一个警告的手势。","While this was passing, the twin-girl—the rosebud that had grown on the same stem with the castaway—stood gazing at her sister, longing to fling herself upon her bosom, so that the tendrils of their hearts might intertwine again.At first she was restrained by mingled grief and shame, and by a dread that Prudence was too much changed to respond to her affection, or that her own purity would be felt as a reproach by the lost one.But, as she listened to the familiar voice, while the face grew more and more familiar, she forgot everything save that Prudence had come back.Springing forward, she would have clasped her in a close embrace.At that very instant, however, Prudence started from her chair, and held out both her hands, with a warning gesture."
"“不，玛丽——不要这样，妹妹，”她叫道，“千万别碰我。我们的胸膛不能靠在一起！”","“No, Mary,—no, my sister,” cried she, “do not you touch me.Your bosom must not be pressed to mine!”"
"玛丽战栗了一下，一动不动地站着。她俩在父亲的火炉边一起长大。尽管在父亲炉火的火光中，她们似乎离得如此之近，但她感到自己和普鲁登斯之间隔着一些比坟墓还要黑暗的东西，。这时，普鲁登斯环顾四周，寻找那个还没向她表示欢迎的人。他已经离开了火炉旁的座位，现在正站在门边上，脸扭向一旁，所以只能从墙上闪动的影子里分辨出他的面孔。不过，普鲁登斯用欢快而亲切的语气向他唤道：","Mary shuddered and stood still, for she felt that something darker than the grave was between Prudence and herself, though they seemed so near each other in the light of their father’s hearth, where they had grown up together.Meanwhile Prudence threw her eyes around the room, in search of one who had not yet bidden her welcome.He had withdrawn from his seat by the fireside, and was standing near the door, with his face averted, so that his features could be discerned only by the flickering shadow of the profile upon the wall.But Prudence called to him, in a cheerful and kindly tone:—"
"“过来，罗伯特，”她说，“不想和老朋友握握手吗？”","“Come, Robert,” said she, “won’t you shake hands with your old friend?”"
"罗伯特·穆尔克制了片刻，但最终强烈的感情还是战胜了他的自尊心和怨恨；他冲向普鲁登斯，抓起她的手，紧紧贴在自己的胸口。","Robert Moore held back for a moment, but affection struggled powerfully, and overcame his pride and resentment; he rushed towards Prudence, seized her hand, and pressed it to his bosom."
"“好啦，好啦，罗伯特！”她抽回手说道，笑容里带着忧伤，“你不该这么热烈地欢迎我。”","“There, there, Robert!” said she, smiling sadly, as she withdrew her hand, “you must not give me too warm a welcome.”"
"现在，普鲁登斯已经和家里所有人都打过招呼了，她又坐回约翰右手边的椅子上。她天生是一个十分敏感而温柔的女孩子，她的性情通常是乐观的。不过在她最快乐的言行之中，却常混合着一种迷人的感伤。人们还说，她从孩提时代起便有一种魔力，能将自己的情绪像符咒似的传染给她的同伴。在她天真无邪的日子里便是如此，今晚似乎也是这样。对她的归来感到惊讶和困惑的朋友们，几乎忘了她曾经离开过，也忘了她已丧失要求他们喜爱她的权利。也许早上，他们会以另一种眼光看待她，但在这个感恩节夜晚的炉火边，他们只觉得普鲁登斯终于回到了他们身边，并对此感到欣慰。随着约翰·英格尔菲尔德的内心变得温暖而愉快，他心灵的愉悦之光使他那粗糙的脸庞也容光焕发起来；有那么一两次，他放声大笑，甚至房间里都有回响，连他本人都好像被自己欢笑的回声吓了一跳。严肃的青年牧师变成了调皮的男生。如玫瑰花蕾般的玛丽也忘了那朵和她并蒂而生的花朵已从花茎上被摘下，又在灰尘中被践踏。至于罗伯特·穆尔，他腼腆而热诚地注视着普鲁登斯，眼里充满了新生的爱意。而普鲁登斯则露出甜美的少女的媚态，半是含笑，半是婉拒。","And now, having exchanged greetings with each member of the family, Prudence again seated herself in the chair at John Inglefield’s right hand.She was naturally a girl of quick and tender sensibilities, gladsome in her general mood, but with a bewitching pathos interfused among her merriest words and deeds.It was remarked of her, too, that she had a faculty, even from childhood, of throwing her own feelings, like a spell, over her companions.Such as she had been in her days of innocence, so did she appear this evening.Her friends, in the surprise and bewilderment of her return, almost forgot that she had ever left them, or that she had forfeited any of her claims to their affection.In the morning, perhaps, they might have looked at her with altered eyes, but by the Thanksgiving fireside they felt only that their own Prudence had come back to them, and were thankful.John Inglefleld’s rough visage brightened with the glow of his heart, as it grew warm and merry within him; once or twice, even, he laughed till the room rang again, yet seemed startled by the echo of his own mirth.The grave young minister became as frolicsome as a school-boy.Mary, too, the rosebud, forgot that her twin-blossom had ever been torn from the stem, and trampled in the dust.And as for Robert Moore, he gazed at Prudence with the bashful earnestness of love new-born, while she, with sweet maiden coquetry, half smiled upon and half discouraged him."
"总之，在这段短暂的时光里，忧伤消失在其阴影深处，而快乐开始出现在短暂的明亮之中，这种时刻还间歇地出现了多次。当钟声敲响了八下，普鲁登斯为父亲倒他常喝的花草茶，倒出饮一次的量。这茶早在傍晚时分就泡好了，一直放在火炉边。","In short, it was one of those intervals when sorrow vanishes in its own depth of shadow, and joy starts forth in transitory brightness.When the clock struck eight, Prudence poured out her father’s customary draught of herb-tea, which had been steeping by the fireside ever since twilight."
"“上帝保佑你，孩子！”约翰·英格尔菲尔德从她手中接过茶杯时说，“你让老父亲又高兴了起来。但是我们很想念你妈妈，普鲁登斯，想极了。似乎她此时此刻就该在这里。”","“God bless you, child!” said John Inglefield, as he took the cup from her hand; “you have made your old father happy again.But we miss your mother sadly, Prudence, sadly.It seems as if she ought to be here now.”"
"“是的，爸爸，此时此刻，或者永不再来。”普鲁登斯答道。","“Now, father, or never,” replied Prudence."
"这时该做家庭祷告了。但是正当一家人在做祷告准备时，却突然发现普鲁登斯已穿上她的带帽披风，正在拔门闩。","It was now the hour for domestic worship.But while the family were making preparations for this duty, they suddenly perceived that Prudence had put on her cloak and hood, and was lifting the latch of the door."
"“普鲁登斯，普鲁登斯！你要去哪儿？”大家异口同声地喊道。","“Prudence, Prudence! where are you going?” cried they all, with one voice."
"普鲁登斯走出门，转身挥手向大家告别。但她的脸却已变得难以辨认了。她那动人的面孔下显露出罪恶和邪欲，扭曲得变了形，令人毛骨悚然。她的眼里闪过一丝笑容，仿佛胜利者一般，嘲笑着他们的惊讶与哀伤。","As Prudence passed out of the door, she turned towards them, and flung back her hand with a gesture of farewell.But her face was so changed that they hardly recognized it.Sin and evil passions glowed through its comeliness, and wrought a horrible deformity; a smile gleamed in her eyes, as of triumphant mockery, at their surprise and grief."
"“女儿，”又气愤又伤心的约翰·英格尔菲尔德叫道，“留下来吧，这将是你父亲的福气，否则就带着他的诅咒离开！”","“Daughter,” cried John Inglefield, between wrath and sorrow, “stay and be your father’s blessing, or take his curse with you!”"
"普鲁登斯迟疑了片刻，回头望了望那灯火通明的房间，她的表情就好像她正在和一个魔鬼搏斗。这个魔鬼力量无比强大，甚至能在她父亲炉火的神圣庇护范围内将他的祭品捕获。魔鬼最终获胜了，普鲁登斯消失在屋外的黑暗之中。等大家跑到门口，却什么也看不见，只听到车轮与结冰的路面摩擦发出的咯吱声。","For an instant Prudence lingered and looked back into the fire-lighted room, while her countenance wore almost the expression as if she were struggling with a fiend, who had power to seize his victim even within the hallowed precincts of her father’s hearth.The fiend prevailed; and Prudence vanished into the outer darkness.When the family rushed to the door, they could see nothing, but heard the sound of wheels rattling over the frozen ground."
"当天晚上，在附近一座城市的剧院里，在一群浓妆艳抹的美人中，有一位正在纵情欢笑；对纯洁的情感以及被其神圣化的各种快乐和忧愁表示过的任何同情之意，与这笑声相比都显得格格不入。然而，这就是普鲁登斯·英格尔菲尔德。她在感恩节回到家里的炉火边，是为了实现自己的一个白日梦；梦中那颗负罪的灵魂能偶尔迷途知返，回到清白无罪的正道上来。哎！但是罪恶提防着她的奴仆们。在这个最为神圣的时刻，他们或许听到了她的声音，不得不赶到她召唤他们去的地方。同样的邪恶力量将普鲁登斯·英格尔菲尔德从她父亲火炉边拖走——本质上是相同的，尽管随后已上升到可怕的程度——这种力量也会从天国的门口夺走负罪的灵魂，并使它的罪与罚永远延续下去。","That same night, among the painted beauties at the theatre of a neighboring city, there was one whose dissolute mirth seemed inconsistent with any sympathy for pure affections, and for the joys and griefs which are hallowed by them.Yet this was Prudence Inglefield.Her visit to the Thanksgiving fireside was the realization of one of those waking dreams in which the guilty soul will sometimes stray back to its innocence.But Sin, alas! is careful of her bond-slaves; they hear her voice, perhaps, at the holiest moment, and are constrained to go whither she summons them.The same dark power that drew Prudence Inglefleld from her father’s hearth—the same in its nature, though heightened then to a dread necessity—would snatch a guilty soul from the gate of heaven, and make its sin and its punishment alike eternal."
