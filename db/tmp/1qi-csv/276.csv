"石人","The Man of Adamant"
"作者：纳撒尼尔·霍桑","by Nathaniel Hawthorne"
"在那笼罩着宗教阴霾与偏狭的古代，有个名叫理查德·迪格比的人。他是一个严苛的兄弟会的成员，而且是该兄弟会中最阴沉、最偏狭的一位。他的救世计划是如此之狭隘，就像暴风雨中漂浮在海面上的一块木板，除了他自己以外，再承载不了其他罪人。他幸灾乐祸地跨坐在那块木板上，诅咒他面前那些在永恒的死亡巨浪中挣扎的可怜之人。在他看来，除了这块他倍加小心地守护以免落入他人之手的狭窄木板之外，如果其他人想依靠他们自身的力量，或者甚至想牢牢抓住残骸中的碎片以拯救他们自己都是可恶之极的行为——事实上，也是愚蠢透顶的想法。换言之，他的宗教信条与他人的不同，他很庆幸在芸芸众生之中，上帝唯独托付给了他真正的信仰宝藏。于是理查德·迪格比决定隐居于世，独自长久地享受他的福分。","In the old times of religious gloom and intolerance lived Richard Digby, the gloomiest and most intolerant of a stern brotherhood.His plan of salvation was so narrow, that, like a plank in a tempestuous sea, it could avail no sinner but himself, who bestrode it triumphantly, and hurled anathemas against the wretches whom he saw struggling with the billows of eternal death.In his view of the matter, it was a most abominable crime—as, indeed, it is a great folly—for men to trust to their own strength, or even to grapple to any other fragment of the wreck, save this narrow plank, which, moreover, he took special care to keep out of their reach.In other words, as his creed was like no man’s else, and being well pleased that Providence had intrusted him alone, of mortals, with the treasure of a true faith, Richard Digby determined to seclude himself to the sole and constant enjoyment of his happy fortune."
"“毫无疑问，”他觉得，“我认为上帝施恩于我的首要条件是我不能和那些被他抛弃、注定要灭亡而且令人憎恶的芸芸众生有思想上的交流。”要是我在基达人的帐篷里多逗留一会儿，也许，上帝就会收回其宽厚的恩惠。那么，我也会被愤怒的洪水吞噬，或者毁灭于烈火硫磺的狂袭之中，又或者身陷某种新的堕落之中，这堕落注定了这一代人可怕的道德沦丧。”","“And verily,” thought he, “I deem it a chief condition of Heaven’s mercy to myself, that I hold no communion with those abominable myriads which it hath cast off to perish.Peradventure, were I to tarry longer in the tents of Kedar, the gracious boon would be revoked, and I also be swallowed up in the deluge of wrath, or consumed in the storm of fire and brimstone, or involved in whatever new kind of ruin is ordained for the horrible perversity of this generation.”"
"于是理查德·迪格比带上一把斧头和几样其他必需品。斧头是用来在野外砍伐树木，辟出一块足以搭建一间帐篷的地方；其他必需品，尤其是一把剑和一支枪，是用来打倒和杀死任何闯入他的神圣隐居地的人。然后他就深入到最阴郁的森林腹地。但是，在森林的边缘，他停了片刻，对着他此前居住的村庄，他抖了抖脚上的尘埃，又对着村里的礼拜堂咒骂了几句，他认为那是异教徒膜拜偶像的庙堂。他还感到好奇，既然他这个唯一的道义之人已经自己找到了安全之所，他还想看看烈火硫磺是否会即刻从天而降。但是，阳光依旧平静地照耀在村舍和田野上，农夫们仍在劳作，孩子们仍在玩耍，许多事物都显示出当下的幸福，丝毫看不出最后审判日即将来临的任何恶兆，他转身离去，感觉有些失望。然而，他走得愈远愈觉得形单影只，路旁的树木也愈浓密，头顶上的阴影也愈阴暗，但理查德·迪格比却感觉愈加狂喜。他一边大步往前走，一边自言自语；在树下停歇之时，他就给自己读《圣经》；我还得补充一句，不论清晨、午间，还是黄昏，当阴暗的森林遮住了神圣的天空之时，他都会为自己祷告。这种生活方式与他的性情是如此契合，所以他时常独自大笑，但是在回声传来自己悠长响亮的吼声时，他却感到不快。","So Richard Digby took an axe, to hew space enough for a tabernacle in the wilderness, and some few other necessaries, especially a sword and gun, to smite and slay any intruder upon his hallowed seclusion; and plunged into the dreariest depths of the forest.On its verge, however, he paused a moment, to shake off the dust of his feet against the village where he had dwelt, and to invoke a curse on the meeting-house, which he regarded as a temple of heathen idolatry.He felt a curiosity, also, to see whether the fire and brimstone would not rush down from Heaven at once, now that the one righteous man had provided for his own safety.But, as the sunshine continued to fall peacefully on the cottages and fields, and the husbandmen labored and children played, and as there were many tokens of present happiness, and nothing ominous of a speedy judgment, he turned away, somewhat disappointed.The farther he went, however, and the lonelier he felt himself, and the thicker the trees stood along his path, and the darker the shadow overhead, so much the more did Richard Digby exult.He talked to himself, as he strode onward; he read his Bible to himself, as he sat beneath the trees; and, as the gloom of the forest hid the blessed sky, I had almost added, that, at morning, noon, and eventide, he prayed to himself.So congenial was this mode of life to his disposition, that he often laughed to himself, but was displeased when an echo tossed him back the long loud roar."
"他就这样赶了三天两夜的路。第三天的晚上，他来到一个洞穴口。乍眼一看，这洞穴让他想起在霍雷布的以利亚洞穴，但可能更像在麦比拉洞的亚伯拉罕的墓穴。这洞穴一直延伸至一座岩石山丘的腹地。缠结成密网的枝条藤蔓遮住了整个洞口，使得只有极其喜欢阴沉幽深之地的人才能找到其低矮的拱形入口，或许也只有这样的人才敢于进入其拱状的密室，里面迎接他的可能是一头黑豹的火辣辣的双眼。如果造物主创造这么一个偏僻而凄凉的洞窟，其用意是留给人类使用的话，那人们只可能把那些死于瘟疫的人埋葬在这洞穴的阴暗之中，再用石块堵死洞口，此后永远避开这个地方。除了离洞口20步左右远的地方潺潺流动着的一泓泉水，洞口附近没有任何明亮或使人愉快的东西，而理查德·迪格比几乎瞟都没瞟一眼那泉水。但是，他把头伸进洞内看了看，颤抖了一下，然后暗自窃喜。","In this manner, he journeyed onward three days and two nights, and came, on the third evening, to the mouth of a cave, which, at first sight, reminded him of Elijah’s cave at Horeb, though perhaps it more resembled Abraham’s sepulchral cave at Machpelah.It entered into the heart of a rocky hill.There was so dense a veil of tangled foliage about it, that none but a sworn lover of gloomy recesses would have discovered the low arch of its entrance, or have dared to step within its vaulted chamber, where the burning eyes of a panther might encounter him.If Nature meant this remote and dismal cavern for the use of man, it could only be to bury in its gloom the victims of a pestilence, and then to block up its mouth with stones, and avoid the spot forever after.There was nothing bright nor cheerful near it, except a bubbling fountain, some twenty paces off, at which Richard Digby hardly threw away a glance.But he thrust his head into the cave, shivered, and congratulated himself."
"“这是上帝在指引我！”他大声呼喊道，呼喊声在坟墓般的洞穴里传来古怪的回声，好像洞里有人在嘲讽他似的。“在这里，我的灵魂将得到安宁，因为邪恶的人找不到我。在这里，我可以读《圣经》，且不会再被谎言连篇的阐释所激怒。在这里，我可以做上帝所接受的祷告，因为我的声音不会和凡众那罪孽深重的哀求声混杂在一起。诚然，这洞穴的狭窄入口就是通往天堂的唯一之路——而唯独我找到了这条道路！”","“The finger of Providence hath pointed my way!” cried he, aloud, while the tomb-like den returned a strange echo, as if some one within were mocking him.“Here my soul will be at peace; for the wicked will not find me.Here I can read the Scriptures, and be no more provoked with lying interpretations.Here I can offer up acceptable prayers, because my voice will not be mingled with the sinful supplications of the multitude.Of a truth, the only way to heaven leadeth through the narrow entrance of this cave,—and I alone have found it!”"
"说到这洞穴，只要是微弱的光线能照到的地方，就能看见洞顶上都挂满了不透明的冰柱似的物体，经历了不知多少个世纪的水珠不断滴落后，都变得像石头般坚硬；水珠不论滴落到哪里，都像拥有一股力量，能把它浸湿过的物体变成石头。被风吹进洞内的落叶和小树枝，以及生长在洞口的矮小而柔软的灌木丛都未受到天然露珠的浸润，却在这奇异的过程中经久不腐。说到这里，我想起来，理查德·迪格比来此隐居之前，一些高明的医生诊断说他患有一种在医书上找不到疗法的疾病。那是一种由血液循环受阻导致心脏内部出现结石颗粒沉积的疾病；除非有奇迹出现，否则该病可能危及他的整个器官，把他的肉质心脏转变成石头。事实上，多数医生已经判定结石过程已接近完成。但是，理查德·迪格比从来不相信他的体内会有着这样一种可怕的疾病。当他看见那些已经化为石头的小树枝时，它们与曾经娇嫩的草木之态如此相似，并没让他的心跳加快。也许，麻木正是这种疾病的一个症状。","In regard to this cave it was observable that the roof, so far as the imperfect light permitted it to be seen, was hung with substances resembling opaque icicles; for the damps of unknown centuries, dripping down continually, had become as hard as adamant; and wherever that moisture fell, it seemed to possess the power of converting what it bathed to stone.The fallen leaves and sprigs of foliage, which the wind had swept into the cave, and the little feathery shrubs, rooted near the threshold, were not wet with a natural dew, but had been embalmed by this wondrous process.And here I am put in mind that Richard Digby, before he withdrew himself from the world, was supposed by skilful physicians to have contracted a disease for which no remedy was written in their medical books.It was a deposition of calculous particles within his heart, caused by an obstructed circulation of the blood; and, unless a miracle should be wrought for him, there was danger that the malady might act on the entire substance of the organ, and change his fleshy heart to stone.Many, indeed, affirmed that the process was already near its consummation.Richard Digby, however, could never be convinced that any such direful work was going on within him; nor when he saw the sprigs of marble foliage, did his heart even throb the quicker, at the similitude suggested by these once tender herbs.It may be that this same insensibility was a symptom of the disease."
"不管怎样，理查德·迪格比对他这墓穴式的洞穴很是满意。他对这个和他情趣相投的地方是如此之喜爱，以至于他口渴时也不愿走到几步之隔的那泓潺潺流动的泉水边喝口水，而是喝从洞顶上时不时滴落下来的水珠解渴。这些水珠如果不落到他的舌头上，而是落到其他任何地方都会凝结成小圆石。这对一个心脏即将石化的人来说，无疑是一种有害液体。但他就这样在这里住了三天多，吃的是草木树根，喝的是能毁灭自己的水，睡的是无异于坟墓的地方，并在死亡般的孤寂中醒来，他却认为这种可怕的生活方式不亚于极乐世界。可能比极乐世界还更胜一筹，因为在天堂，还有天使可能会打扰他。在第三天结束的时候，他坐在自己的宅邸入口，大声地读着《圣经》，因为没有人会因听到他的朗读而受益。但他老是读错，因为落日的余晖无法穿透他周围厚厚的阴暗层，照到那神圣的书页上。但是突然间，一缕微弱的光照到了书卷上。理查德·迪格比抬眼一看，看见洞口站着一位年轻女子，她身着白色外衣，在阳光的照耀下散发出一种仿佛是自身独有的光芒。","Be that as it might, Richard Digby was well contented with his sepulchral cave.So dearly did he love this congenial spot, that, instead of going a few paces to the bubbling spring for water, he allayed his thirst with now and then a drop of moisture from the roof, which, had it fallen anywhere but on his tongue, would have been congealed into a pebble.For a man predisposed to stoniness of the heart, this surely was unwholesome liquor.But there he dwelt, for three days more eating herbs and roots, drinking his own destruction, sleeping, as it were, in a tomb, and awaking to the solitude of death, yet esteeming this horrible mode of life as hardly inferior to celestial bliss.Perhaps superior; for, above the sky, there would be angels to disturb him.At the close of the third day, he sat in the portal of his mansion, reading the Bible aloud, because no other ear could profit by it, and reading it amiss, because the rays of the setting sun did not penetrate the dismal depth of shadow round about him, nor fall upon the sacred page.Suddenly, however, a faint gleam of light was thrown over the volume, and, raising his eyes, Richard Digby saw that a young woman stood before the mouth of the cave, and that the sunbeams bathed her white garment, which thus seemed to possess a radiance of its own."
"“晚上好，理查德，”女子说道，“我从遥远的地方来此地找你。”","“Good evening, Richard,” said the girl; “I have come from afar to find thee.”"
"理查德·迪格比一下子就认出了这位苗条、端庄、温柔、可爱的女子。她名叫玛丽·戈菲。她是他在英格兰布道时皈依他的一名信徒，那时他还没有陷入现在这种极度排外的偏执状态。这种偏执现在包裹着他，像铁器一样牢牢抓住了他，任何其他情感都无法触动他的心底。当他以朝圣者的身份来美国时，她留在了她父亲身边。而现在，很显然，她怀着与那些流亡至此的人们同样的信仰来到这里，或许怀着几乎同样神圣的爱情跨越大洋，追随他而来。如果不是信仰和爱情，还有什么能支撑一位如此娇弱的女子不顾金发被树枝刮得蓬乱，不怕双脚被刺伤，而千里迢迢来到这样的森林深处呢？但是，尽管她一定已经疲惫不堪、软弱无力了，而且肯定已被洞穴的凄凉吓得心惊肉跳，但她仍然以温和怜悯的眼神看着这个孤独的人，仿佛是一位天使向一位受苦受难的凡人投去怜悯的目光。但是，这个隐士皱起了眉头，恶狠狠地盯着她，一只手的手指夹在半开的《圣经》里，另外一只手示意她走开。","The slender grace and gentle loveliness of this young woman were at once recognized by Richard Digby.Her name was Mary Goffe.She had been a convert to his preaching of the word in England, before he yielded himself to that exclusive bigotry which now enfolded him with such an iron grasp that no other sentiment could reach his bosom.When he came a pilgrim to America, she had remained in her father’s hall; but now, as it appeared, had crossed the ocean after him, impelled by the same faith that led other exiles hither, and perhaps by love almost as holy.What else but faith and love united could have sustained so delicate a creature, wandering thus far into the forest, with her golden hair dishevelled by the boughs, and her feet wounded by the thorns?Yet, weary and faint though she must have been, and affrighted at the dreariness of the cave, she looked on the lonely man with a mild and pitying expression, such as might beam from an angel’s eyes, towards an afflicted mortal.But the recluse, frowning sternly upon her, and keeping his finger between the leaves of his half-closed Bible, motioned her away with his hand."
"“走开！”他叫道，“我是神圣纯洁的，而你是罪孽深重的。走开！”","“Off!” cried he.“I am sanctified, and thou art sinful.Away!”"
"“哦，理查德，”她真诚地说道，“我跋山涉水来到这里，是因为我听说有种非常严重的病吞噬了你的心脏，而一位伟大的医生告诉了我医治你这种疾病的药方。除了我带来的这种药方，就再也没有别的方法能医治你的病了。所以，别赶我走，也不要拒绝服用我的药，否则这个凄凉的洞穴必将成为你的坟墓。”","“O Richard,” said she, earnestly, “I have come this weary way because I heard that a grievous distemper had seized upon thy heart; and a great Physician hath given me the skill to cure it.There is no other remedy than this which I have brought thee.Turn me not away, therefore, nor refuse my medicine; for then must this dismal cave be thy sepulchre.”"
"“走开！”理查德·迪格比回道，仍旧阴沉地皱着眉，“我的心脏比你的健康多了。走开，世俗的人，太阳就要落山了，洞口没有阳光时，我就该做祷告了。”","“Away!” replied Richard Digby, still with a dark frown.“My heart is in better condition than thine own.Leave me, earthly one; for the sun is almost set; and when no light reaches the door of the cave, then is my prayer-time.”"
"现在，尽管玛丽·戈菲急需找到一个遮风挡雨又安全的地方歇脚，但她没有向这位铁石心肠的人恳求，也没有为自己向他索取任何东西。她的满腔热忱都是为了他的安康。","Now, great as was her need, Mary Goffe did not plead with this stony-hearted man for shelter and protection, nor ask anything whatever for her own sake.All her zeal was for his welfare."
"“跟我回去吧！”她紧握着双手喊道，“回到你的同伴们身边去吧，因为他们需要你，理查德，而你更是十倍地需要他们。别再呆在这个邪恶的洞穴里了，这里寒气逼人、湿气致命。在这洞里死亡的人都找不到去往天堂的路。快出来吧，我恳求你，看在你自己灵魂的份上，因为不是洞顶坍塌下来压在你头上，就是随时有其他灾难马上降临。”","“Come back with me!” she exclaimed, clasping her hands,—“come back to thy fellow-men; for they need thee, Richard, and thou hast tenfold need of them.Stay not in this evil den; for the air is chill, and the damps are fatal; nor will any that perish within it ever find the path to heaven.Hasten hence, I entreat thee, for thine own soul’s sake; for either the roof will fall upon thy head, or some other speedy destruction is at hand.”"
"“执迷不悟的女人！”理查德·迪格比高声大笑道——她愚蠢的热心使他冷笑——“告诉你，我现在坐着的这个狭窄入口就是直通天堂的道路。还有，你说到的毁灭注定要降临到全世界所有人的居所，却不会降临到我这个受神灵保佑的洞穴。你快走吧，那毁灭也有你的一份！”","“Perverse woman!” answered Richard Digby, laughing aloud,—for he was moved to bitter mirth by her foolish vehemence,—“I tell thee that the path to heaven leadeth straight through this narrow portal where I sit.And, moreover, the destruction thou speakest of is ordained, not for this blessed cave, but for all other habitations of mankind, throughout the earth.Get thee hence speedily, that thou mayst have thy share!”"
"说完，他再次打开《圣经》，专注地看起来，决定不让这个罪恶神谴的女子分散他的心思，也不想再在她身上浪费他圣洁的口舌。他坐的地方已变得很暗了，让他不断读错字，把那些宽厚而仁慈的内容读成了复仇的谴责，读成了降临在除他以外的任何生灵身上难以言状的灾难。此时，玛丽·戈菲一直倚靠在那墓穴般的洞穴旁边的一棵树上，面带忧伤，但她无私的忧伤流露出某种神圣和超然的神情。落日的光线依旧照在她身上，使她显得光彩照人，被折射的光线还照亮了阴暗洞穴内的一小片区域。看到洞内如此阴沉恐怖，少女不禁为这位自愿在里面受苦的人战栗不已。少女看到不远处那泓清澈的泉水，便很快走过去，用桦树皮制作成的杯子舀起泉水。几点泪水滴落进杯子，与泉水混合到一起，也许正因为如此，才使那杯水有了治病的功效。然后，她回到洞口，在理查德·迪格比的脚边跪了下来。","So saying, he opened his Bible again, and fixed his eyes intently on the page, being resolved to withdraw his thoughts from this child of sin and wrath, and to waste no more of his holy breath upon her.The shadow had now grown so deep, where he was sitting, that he made continual mistakes in what he read, converting all that was gracious and merciful to denunciations of vengeance and unutterable woe on every created being but himself.Mary Goffe, meanwhile, was leaning against a tree, beside the sepulchral cave, very sad, yet with something heavenly and ethereal in her unselfish sorrow.The light from the setting sun still glorified her form, and was reflected a little way within the darksome den, discovering so terrible a gloom that the maiden shuddered for its self-doomed inhabitant.Espying the bright fountain near at hand, she hastened thither, and scooped up a portion of its water, in a cup of birchen bark.A few tears mingled with the draught, and perhaps gave it all its efficacy.She then returned to the mouth of the cave, and knelt down at Richard Digby’s feet."
"“理查德，” 她说，语气激动而热忱，同时又带着几分温和，“我恳求你，如果你想进入天堂，不想永远住在这墓穴里，就喝下这杯圣水，哪怕是喝下一滴也行！然后，在你身边为我留下一席之地，让我们一起读这神圣书卷中的一页，最后请和我一起跪下来祈祷！照我说的去做，你那石头般坚硬的心将会变得比婴儿的心还柔软，一切都会好起来的。”","“Richard,” she said, with passionate fervor, yet a gentleness in all her passion, “I pray thee, by thy hope of heaven, and as thou wouldst not dwell in this tomb forever, drink of this hallowed water, be it but a single drop!Then, make room for me by thy side, and let us read together one page of that blessed volume; and, lastly, kneel down with me and pray!Do this, and thy stony heart shall become softer than a babe’s, and all be well.”"
"但理查德·迪格比对这建议厌恶之极。他把《圣经》扔在脚边，死盯着她，恶狠狠地紧皱着眉头，看起来不像是个活人，却像是某个思想阴暗的雕塑家手下的一尊大理石雕塑，把人类面部所能表现出的最可憎的表情都表现出来了。他的表情渐渐变得几乎如魔鬼般穷凶极恶，但玛丽·戈菲的表情也在变化，变得更加忧伤、更加温和、更加慈悲、更像是一位悲伤的天使。但是，她变得越超凡脱俗，理查德·迪格比就越憎恶她。最后，他伸手把那杯神水重重地摔在洞穴口。就这样，他拒绝了能医治好石头心脏的唯一药物。有那么片刻，空气中洋溢着甜美的芳香，随即就消失了。","But Richard Digby, in utter abhorrence of the proposal, cast the Bible at his feet, and eyed her with such a fixed and evil frown, that he looked less like a living man than a marble statue, wrought by some dark-imagined sculptor to express the most repulsive mood that human features could assume.And, as his look grew even devilish, so, with an equal change did Mary Goffe become more sad, more mild, more pitiful, more like a sorrowing angel.But, the more heavenly she was, the more hateful did she seem to Richard Digby, who at length raised his hand, and smote down the cup of hallowed water upon the threshold of the cave, thus rejecting the only medicine that could have cured his stony heart.A sweet perfume lingered in the air for a moment, and then was gone."
"“别再诱惑我了，可恶的女人，”他呼喊道，仍旧皱着眉头，一副冷酷无情的样子，“否则我把你也狠狠地摔在地上！我的《圣经》跟你有什么关系？——我的祈祷跟你有什么关系？——我的天堂跟你有什么关系？”","“Tempt me no more, accursed woman,” exclaimed he, still with his marble frown, “lest I smite thee down also!What hast thou to do with my Bible? —what with my prayers?—what with my heaven?”"
"刚说完这些可怕的话，理查德·迪格比的心脏便停止了跳动；而此时——据传说——玛丽·戈菲的身体融入了最后的一丝余晖，从这坟墓般的洞穴回到了天堂。由于几个月前玛丽·戈菲已被安葬在了英国一处墓地里，所以在那荒凉的森林中出现的女子可能是她的鬼魂，也可能是象征纯洁宗教的梦一般的幽灵。","No sooner had he spoken these dreadful words, than Richard Digby’s heart ceased to beat; while—so the legend says—the form of Mary Goffe melted into the last sunbeams, and returned from the sepulchral cave to heaven.For Mary Golfe had been buried in an English churchyard, months before; and either it was her ghost that haunted the wild forest, or else a dream-like spirit, typifying pure Religion."
"一百多年后，理查德·迪格比时代人迹罕至的森林，如今早已住上了人家，附近一户农家的孩子们正在一座小山的山脚下玩耍。由于这个陡坡的地面人迹罕至且崎岖不平，上面的树木从未被砍伐，所以十分茂密，把下面掩盖得严严实实，只看得见几块突出的岩石，岩石周围是扎根于土壤中的树木。一个小男孩和一个小女孩，为了躲藏起来不让玩伴们找到，便爬进了这阴暗的森林深处。这里不仅长有灰暗的松树，还有从悬垂着的岩石上落下来的藤本植物。它们共同形成厚厚的帷幕，使这里即便是在正午也像在黄昏时一般阴暗，一年四季几乎都像午夜一般漆黑。两小孩就在这个地方躲藏了起来，叫喊着，隔一会儿就叫一声，直到把所有寻找他俩的孩子们都吸引到了那里，然后它们拉开缠结在一起的枝蔓，让一束光隐隐约约地照了进去。但是，还没等光将洞里全部照亮，这一群小孩便同时尖叫起来，然后跌跌撞撞地跑下山，拼命往家跑，不敢朝那阴沉的幽深处再看一眼。孩子们的父亲不知道什么把它们吓成这样，于是带上斧头，砍倒了一两棵树，又扯断了各种蔓藤植物，洞内的神秘便显露在光天化日之下。他发现了一个山洞，其入口很像一座墓穴的入口，里面坐着一个人形，其坐姿和神态吓得父亲和孩子们都不敢靠近。那人紧皱双眉的面容，令人望而却步。这令人生畏的人形看似跟洞穴的洞壁和入口一样，都是用灰石雕琢而成的。事实上，再仔细一看，可以发现有些问题，让人质疑这是否真的是一尊人工雕刻的雕像，只是随着岁月的流逝受到磨损而腐蚀了，或者是大自然想在一块石头上模仿出其通常制造的血肉之躯，就制造出了这么个怪人。也许，对于这一奇异景象，最合理的解释就是，洞穴的湿气具有石化作用，能很好地保持一具尸体不腐烂。","Above a century afterwards, when the trackless forest of Richard Digby’s day had long been interspersed with settlements, the children of a neighboring farmer were playing at the foot of a hill.The trees, on account of the rude and broken surface of this acclivity, had never been felled, and were crowded so densely together as to hide all but a few rocky prominences, wherever their roots could grapple with the soil.A little boy and girl, to conceal themselves from their playmates, had crept into the deepest shade, where not only the darksome pines, but a thick veil of creeping plants suspended from an overhanging rock, combined to make a twilight at noonday, and almost a midnight at all other seasons.There the children hid themselves, and shouted, repeating the cry at intervals, till the whole party of pursuers were drawn thither, and, pulling aside the matted foliage, let in a doubtful glimpse of daylight.But scarcely was this accomplished, when the little group uttered a simultaneous shriek, and tumbled headlong down the hill, making the best of their way homeward, without a second glance into the gloomy recess.Their father, unable to comprehend what had so startled them, took his axe, and, by felling one or two trees, and tearing away the creeping plants, laid the mystery open to the day.He had discovered the entrance of a cave, closely resembling the mouth of a sepulchre, within which sat the figure of a man, whose gesture and attitude warned the father and children to stand back, while his visage wore a most forbidding frown.This repulsive personage seemed to have been carved in the same gray stone that formed the walls and portal of the cave.On minuter inspection, indeed, such blemishes were observed, as made it doubtful whether the figure were really a statue, chiselled by human art and somewhat worn and defaced by the lapse of ages, or a freak of Nature, who might have chosen to imitate, in stone, her usual handiwork of flesh.Perhaps it was the least unreasonable idea, suggested by this strange spectacle, that the moisture of the cave possessed a petrifying quality, which had thus awfully embalmed a human corpse."
"这石人的面容看起来如此恐怖，以至于农夫刚从看他的第一眼中回过神来便开始堆起石头，堵塞住洞口。跟他一起来到小山边的妻子也帮他堵洞口。孩子们也勇敢地尽可能向前靠近，用他们的小手抓了满手的小圆石，扔到石堆上。然后，他们用泥土填满缝隙，用草皮盖住整个石堆。于是，这一发现的所有痕迹都被抹去了，只留下了一个绝妙的传说代代相传。孩子们讲给他们的子孙们听，他们的子孙们又把它讲给后一代听。就这样，这传说变得愈来愈荒诞离奇。直到后来，很少有人相信，在那幽暗的小山坡上曾经有一个山洞或者一尊石像，人们现在看到的只是一片绿油油的草地。但是，大人们都回避那个地方，小孩们也都不去那里玩耍。友情、爱情、虔诚，一切人间和天堂的怜悯之心应该都远离那个隐蔽的山洞。因为除非地震把洞顶震塌下来压在他头上，否则理查德·迪格比会依旧坐在那里，永远坐在那里，以一种排斥整个凡众的姿态——不是来自天堂——而是来自于他黑暗、冰冷的坟墓里那恐怖的孤寂！","There was something so frightful in the aspect of this Man of Adamant, that the farmer, the moment that he recovered from the fascination of his first gaze, began to heap stones into the mouth of the cavern.His wife, who had followed him to the hill, assisted her husband’s efforts.The children, also, approached as near as they durst, with their little hands full of pebbles, and cast them on the pile.Earth was then thrown into the crevices, and the whole fabric overlaid with sods.Thus all traces of the discovery were obliterated, leaving only a marvellous legend, which grew wilder from one generation to another, as the children told it to their grandchildren, and they to their posterity, till few believed that there had ever been a cavern or a statue, where now they saw but a grassy patch on the shadowy hillside.Yet, grown people avoid the spot, nor do children play there.Friendship, and Love, and Piety, all human and celestial sympathies, should keep aloof from that hidden cave; for there still sits, and, unless an earthquake crumble down the roof upon his head, shall sit forever, the shape of Richard Digby, in the attitude of repelling the whole race of mortals,—not from heaven,—but from the horrible loneliness of his dark, cold sepulchre!"
