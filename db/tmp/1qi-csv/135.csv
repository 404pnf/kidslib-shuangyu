"饲养家禽","To Raise Poultry"
"作者：马克·吐温","by Mark Twain"
"严格说来，从少年时代起，我就已经开始对饲养家禽这门学科极度着迷了，所以这个会员身份激起了我心中早就存在的共鸣。甚至在学生时代，我就开始研究家禽饲养了。我毫不吹嘘地说，早在十七岁时，我就已经了解所有最好、最快的养鸡方法了，比如把燃烧的火柴放在它们鼻子底下，把它们从鸡窝里逮出来，或是在天寒地冻的夜里，把一块暖和的木板的一端悄悄放在它们脚底下，把它们从栅栏上提溜起来。到我二十岁时，我真觉得我养过的家禽的数量比周围任何地方的任何一个人都要多。那些鸡渐渐知道了我的才华。当我经过时，那些年轻的公鸡母鸡都停下来，不再用爪子刨地找虫子，老公鸡则开始啼叫：“继续祈祷。”","Seriously, from early youth I have taken an especial interest in the subject of poultry-raising, and so this membership touches a ready sympathy in my breast.Even as a schoolboy, poultry-raising was a study with me, and I may say without egotism that as early as the age of seventeen I was acquainted with all the best and speediest methods of raising chickens, from raising them off a roost by burning lucifer matches under their noses, down to lifting them off a fence on a frosty night by insinuating the end of a warm board under their heels.By the time I was twenty years old, I really suppose I had raised more poultry than any one individual in all the section round about there.The very chickens came to know my talent by and by.The youth of both sexes ceased to paw the earth for worms, and old roosters that came to crow, “remained to pray,” when I passed by."
"我在饲养家禽的过程中积累了丰富的经验，不由得想，我的一些窍门或许对这个协会有所帮助。上面我已经提到的两种方法非常简单，只在饲养最普通的那种家禽时使用；一个适合夏天用，另一个适合冬天用。使用夏天用的那个方法时，你可以叫上一个朋友，大概在夏夜十一点左右行动（不要再晚了，因为在有些州——特别是加利福尼亚和俄勒冈州——鸡总是在半夜醒来，并根据它们叫醒人们的难易程度，啼叫十到三十分钟不等），让你的朋友带一个麻袋。来到鸡窝旁（你邻居家的，不是你自家的），你点燃一根火柴，举起来放在一只小母鸡的鼻子下面，再放到另一只的鼻子下面，直到它们老老实实地钻进袋子里为止。然后，你就回家了，根据具体情况，你可以拿着袋子，也可以不拿袋子。注意——我曾有过这样的经历，当时的情况下，我应该并且必须留下麻袋，迅速离开，至于那只麻袋要送往何处，没有留下任何线索。","I have had so much experience in the raising of fowls that I cannot but think that a few hints from me might be useful to the society.The two methods I have already touched upon are very simple, and are only used in the raising of the commonest class of fowls; one is for summer, the other for winter.In the one case you start out with a friend along about eleven o’clock on a summer’s night (not later, because in some states—especially in California and Oregon—chickens always rouse up just at midnight and crow from ten to thirty minutes, according to the ease or difficulty they experience in getting the public waked up), and your friend carries with him a sack.Arrived at the henroost (your neighbor’s, not your own), you light a match and hold it under first one and then another pullet’s nose until they are willing to go into that bag without making any trouble about it.You then return home, either taking the bag with you or leaving it behind, according as circumstances shall dictate.N. B.—I have seen the time when it was eligible and appropriate to leave the sack behind and walk off with considerable velocity, without ever leaving any word where to send it."
"在使用提到的另一个冬天饲养家禽的方法时，你的朋友要带一个有盖子的器皿，里面盛着炭火，你带一条细长的木板。大家都知道，这是个天寒地冻的夜晚。你来到树下、栅栏边，或是别人家的鸡窝旁（要是白痴的话，你就去你自家的），把木板的一端放到你朋友的火盆里烤热，然后高高举起木板，轻轻地蹭一只正在睡觉的鸡的爪子。如果你的木板碰到的确实是只鸡，它绝对会睡眼蒙眬地咯咯叫一两声表达谢意，然后慢慢踱出来趴在木板上，这样它显然是在作案前积极地配合凶手，使自己遭到谋杀，这也让我们脑海中出现了一个严肃的问题，正像当年布莱克斯通脑海中的那个问题一样：他是否真的是有意配合他人才进行自杀，犯下二级罪。[但你不是在当时，而是之后才开始认真思考这些法律细节。]","In the case of the other method mentioned for raising poultry, your friend takes along a covered vessel with a charcoal fire in it, and you carry a long slender plank.This is a frosty night, understand.Arrived at the tree, or fence, or other henroost (your own if you are an idiot), you warm the end of your plank in your friend’s fire vessel, and then raise it aloft and ease it up gently against a slumbering chicken’s foot.If the subject of your attentions is a true bird, he will infallibly return thanks with a sleepy cluck or two, and step out and take up quarters on the plank, thus becoming so conspicuously accessory before the fact to his own murder as to make it a grave question in our minds as it once was in the mind of Blackstone, whether he is not really and deliberately, committing suicide in the second degree.[But you enter into a contemplation of these legal refinements subsequently not then.]"
"当你渴望养一只又漂亮又大、会像驴那样叫的上海公鸡时，你要用一根套索套住它，就像你套牛那样。这是因为你必须得让它窒息，还一定要确实有效地让它窒息。这是唯一确定无疑的好方法，因为只要它提起它很感兴趣的事，它百分之九十九都会立即吸引到别人的注意力，不管是白天还是黑夜。","When you wish to raise a fine, large, donkey voiced Shanghai rooster, you do it with a lasso, just as you would a bull.It is because he must choked, and choked effectually, too.It is the only good, certain way, for whenever he mentions a matter which he is cordially interested in, the chances are ninety-nine in a hundred that he secures somebody else’s immediate attention to it too, whether it day or night."
"西班牙黑鸡是一种极其漂亮的禽类，也十分昂贵。普通的也要三十五美元一只，对于稀有品种，五十美元一只也不稀奇。","The Black Spanish is an exceedingly fine bird and a costly one.Thirty-five dollars is the usual figure and fifty a not uncommon price for a specimen."
"就是它下的蛋，一个也值一到一点五美元，但这种鸡蛋不利于健康，所以城里的医师很少或从不为感化院订购此类鸡蛋。即便如此，我还是曾有一两次趁着漆黑的月夜，什么钱也没花，一次就弄到了多达一打的这种鸡蛋。养西班牙黑鸡最好的方法是，在夜黑时候连笼子一起端。我推荐这种方法的原因是，这种鸡很值钱，主人不允许把它们跟其他品种的鸡关在一起休息，而是把他们放进一个像防火保险箱一样坚固的鸡笼里，晚上还把鸡笼放在厨房里。我所说的这个方法也不是每次都能大功告成，达到令人满意的效果，不过厨房里都有很多小艺术品，如果你没端走鸡笼，你总可以带走其他的东西。有一天夜里，我就带走一个价值九十美分、精致的钢制捕鼠器。","Even its eggs are worth from a dollar to a dollar and a half apiece, and yet are so unwholesome that the city physician seldom or never orders them for the workhouse.Still I have once or twice procured as high as a dozen at a time for nothing, in the dark of the moon.The best way to raise the Black Spanish fowl is to go late in the evening and raise coop and all.The reason I recommend this method is that, the birds being so valuable, the owners do not permit them to roost around promiscuously, they put them in a coop as strong as a fireproof safe and keep it in the kitchen at night.The method I speak of is not always a bright and satisfying success, and yet there are so many little articles of vertu about a kitchen, that if you fail on the coop you can generally bring away something else.I brought away a nice steel trap one night, worth ninety cents."
"但是就算我把自己的所有才华都倾注在这个学科上又有什么意义？我已经向西部纽约家禽协会表明，他们吸纳为核心成员的人绝不是个新手，而是精通家禽的专家，而且掌握最有效的家禽饲养方法，其娴熟程度毫不逊色于协会会长本人。感谢这些先生们授予我名誉会员称号，我将时刻准备并愿意以实际行动——以及我匆忙写出的建议和信息——表达我的感激之情及我的工作热忱。无论他们什么时候准备去养家禽，就叫他们每晚十一点以后叫我吧。","But what is the use in my pouring out my whole intellect on this subject?I have shown the Western New York Poultry Society that they have taken to their bosom a party who is not a spring chicken by any means, but a man who knows all about poultry, and is just as high up in the most efficient methods of raising it as the president of the institution himself.I thank these gentlemen for the honorary membership they have conferred upon me, and shall stand at all times ready and willing to testify my good feeling and my official zeal by deeds as well as by this hastily penned advice and information.Whenever they are ready to go to raising poultry, let them call for me any evening after eleven o’clock."
