"第一章 王子和贫儿的诞生","Chapter I  The Birth of the Prince and the Pauper"
"在十六世纪上半叶后期的某个秋天，古城伦敦里，有一户姓坎蒂的贫穷人家生下了一个男婴，但这家人并不想要他。同一天，在一户姓都铎的富裕人家里诞生了另一个英国婴儿，这家人确实想要他。所有英国人也都盼着他呢。英国人早已盼着他的诞生，期待着他的诞生，为他向上帝祷告。如今, 他真的诞生了，人们高兴得几近疯狂。仅仅是泛泛之交的人也相互拥抱、亲吻，大声欢呼着。不管高低贵贱，不论富裕贫穷，人人都放假了。大家举行宴会，跳舞唱歌，喝得醉醺醺的，不分昼夜地聚会狂欢。白天的伦敦蔚为奇观，家家户户的阳台和屋顶上飘舞着色彩鲜艳的国旗，还有壮观的游行队伍沿街而过。夜晚，伦敦仍是一番胜景，每个角落里都燃着熊熊篝火，狂欢的人群围着火堆尽情欢乐。整个英国都在谈论这个新生的婴儿——威尔士王子爱德华·都铎。他被裹在绫罗绸缎里，没有觉察到这些大惊小怪，也不知道尊贵的贵族老爷和太太们在照料和看守着他，而他对此也并不在意。但是，除了在那个穷人的家里，没人会谈论起另一个婴儿——那裹在破衣烂衫里的汤姆·坎蒂，因为他的出生对这家人来说就是个麻烦。","In the ancient city of London, on a certain autumn day in the second quarter of the sixteenth century, a boy was born to a poor family of the name of Canty, who did not want him.On the same day another English child was born to a rich family of the name of Tudor, who did want him.All England wanted him too.England had so longed for him, and hoped for him, and prayed God for him, that, now that he was really come, the people went nearly mad for joy.Mere acquaintances hugged and kissed each other and cried.Everybody took a holiday, and high and low, rich and poor, feasted and danced and sang, and got very mellow; and they kept this up for days and nights together.By day, London was a sight to see, with gay banners waving from every balcony and housetop, and splendid pageants marching along.By night, it was again a sight to see, with its great bonfires at every corner, and its troops of revellers making merry around them.There was no talk in all England but of the new baby, Edward Tudor, Prince of Wales, who lay lapped in silks and satins, unconscious of all this fuss, and not knowing that great lords and ladies were tending him and watching over him—and not caring, either.But there was no talk about the other baby, Tom Canty, lapped in his poor rags, except among the family of paupers whom he had just come to trouble with his presence."
"第二章 汤姆的早期生活","Chapter II  Tom’s Early Life"
"让我们略过去几年吧。","Let us skip a number of years."
"伦敦有一千五百年的历史，是个大都市——对那个时代来说。它有十万居民，还有人则认为有二十万之多。街道极为狭窄，弯弯曲曲的，而且脏乱不堪，尤其是汤姆·坎蒂住的地区。那儿离伦敦桥不远。那里的房子是木制的，第二层楼从第一层上方突出来，而第三层又伸展到了第二层的外边。房子越高，上面就越宽。房子的骨架是纵横交错的结实的房梁，中间填上固体材料，外面涂上灰泥。根据房主的喜好，屋梁被漆成了红色、蓝色或黑色，使得屋子看起来非常别具一格。窗户很小，装着菱形的小窗格，窗上安着铰链，像门一样朝外开。","London was fifteen hundred years old, and was a great town—for that day.It had a hundred thousand inhabitants—some think double as many.The streets were very narrow, and crooked, and dirty, especially in the part where Tom Canty lived, which was not far from London Bridge.The houses were of wood, with the second story projecting over the first, and the third sticking its elbows out beyond the second.The higher the houses grew, the broader they grew.They were skeletons of strong criss-cross beams, with solid material between, coated with plaster.The beams were painted red or blue or black, according to the owner’s taste, and this gave the houses a very picturesque look.The windows were small, glazed with little diamond-shaped panes, and they opened outward, on hinges, like doors."
"汤姆的父亲住的房子坐落在布丁小巷外一块肮脏的、名叫垃圾大院的小地方。房子狭小而破烂，摇摇欲坠，可里面挤满了可怜的穷苦人家。坎蒂一家住在三层的一间屋子里。母亲和父亲睡在屋角那类似床架的东西上，而汤姆、他祖母，以及两个姐姐贝特和娜恩，则不受什么约束——整个地板都归他们，他们想睡在哪儿都可以。地上有一两块残破的毛毯，几捆又老又脏的稻草。但准确地讲，这都不能称为床铺，因为没人整理。早上，他们把这些东西踢成大大的一堆，晚上就从这一堆中挑一些出来睡。","The house which Tom’s father lived in was up a foul little pocket called Offal Court, out of Pudding Lane.It was small, decayed, and rickety, but it was packed full of wretchedly poor families.Canty’s tribe occupied a room on the third floor.The mother and father had a sort of bedstead in the corner; but Tom, his grandmother, and his two sisters, Bet and Nan, were not restricted—they had all the floor to themselves, and might sleep where they chose.There were the remains of a blanket or two, and some bundles of ancient and dirty straw, but these could not rightly be called beds, for they were not organised; they were kicked into a general pile, mornings, and selections made from the mass at night, for service."
"贝特和娜恩十五岁了，她们是一对双胞胎。她们是好心肠的姑娘，但脏兮兮的，穿着破旧的衣服，而且极其愚昧无知。母亲和她们一样。而父亲和奶奶则是一对恶魔。他们一有机会就喝醉酒，然后互相打架，或跟任何挡了他们路的人打架。不管醉着还是醒着，他们总是在诅咒着，叫骂着。约翰·坎蒂是个小偷，而他母亲是个乞丐。他们让孩子们做了乞丐，却没能让他们变成小偷。在这所房子里的这群可怕的下层民众中间，住着一位独善其身的好心的老牧师。他被国王赶出了家门，只拿几个法寻的养老金。他过去常常把孩子们叫到一边，偷偷地教他们正道。安德鲁神父也教汤姆学些拉丁文，还有怎么读写。他本来还想教女孩子们学这些，但是她们害怕朋友们的讥笑，因为朋友们不能容忍她们有这样奇怪的才能。","Bet and Nan were fifteen years old—twins.They were good-hearted girls, unclean, clothed in rags, and profoundly ignorant.Their mother was like them.But the father and the grandmother were a couple of fiends.They got drunk whenever they could; then they fought each other or anybody else who came in the way; they cursed and swore always, drunk or sober; John Canty was a thief, and his mother a beggar.They made beggars of the children, but failed to make thieves of them.Among, but not of, the dreadful rabble that inhabited the house, was a good old priest whom the King had turned out of house and home with a pension of a few farthings, and he used to get the children aside and teach them right ways secretly.Father Andrew also taught Tom a little Latin, and how to read and write; and would have done the same with the girls, but they were afraid of the jeers of their friends, who could not have endured such a queer accomplishment in them."
"整个垃圾大院就是另一个像坎蒂家的房子一样的蜂窝。在那里，酗酒、暴乱和喧嚷就是生活的常态，夜夜如此，而且几乎持续整晚。在那个地方，被打破头与挨饿一样都是常事。但是，小汤姆并没有不高兴。他曾有一段艰难的时光，但他对此却浑然不觉。那是垃圾大院里所有的男孩子都经历过的时光，因此，他觉得那是正确的、自然而然的事。每当晚上他空手回家时，他知道自己首先面对的会是父亲的一顿臭骂和痛打，随后又是可怕的祖母的新一轮臭骂和痛打，程度有过之而无不及。深夜里，饥饿的母亲会偷偷地把自己挨饿省下来的少得可怜的面包碎片和面包皮塞给他，然而她的这种背叛行为常会被发现，并为此遭到丈夫的一顿毒打。","All Offal Court was just such another hive as Canty’s house.Drunkenness, riot and brawling were the order, there, every night and nearly all night long.Broken heads were as common as hunger in that place.Yet little Tom was not unhappy.He had a hard time of it, but did not know it.It was the sort of time that all the Offal Court boys had; therefore he supposed it was the correct and comfortable thing.When he came home empty-handed at night, he knew his father would curse him and thrash him first, and that when he was done the awful grandmother would do it all over again and improve on it; and that away in the night his starving mother would slip to him stealthily with any miserable scrap or crust she had been able to save for him by going hungry herself, notwithstanding she was often caught in that sort of treason and soundly beaten for it by her husband."
"不，汤姆的生活已经算是好的了，尤其是夏天的时候。他只需讨到够自己活命的东西就可以了，因为反对乞讨的法律很严格，惩罚也很严重。因此，很多时间里，他都去听好心的安德鲁神父讲迷人的老故事和传说，关于巨人和仙女啦，小矮人和鬼怪啦，还有被施了魔法的城堡、风度翩翩的国王和王子。他脑瓜里开始装满了这些精彩的事情。很多个夜晚，当他躺在他那薄薄的、有些扎人的稻草上，又累又饿，还忍受着挨打后的刺痛时，他就放开想象的缰绳，想象着皇宫里受宠的王子那种无忧无虑的生活。在这种甜美的想象中，他很快就忘了自己的疼痛。有个愿望时常整天整夜地萦绕着他，那就是亲眼见到一位真正的王子。有一次，他把这个愿望告诉了垃圾大院的伙伴们，但却遭到了他们无情的讥笑和嘲弄。从那之后，他宁愿把自己的梦想藏在心里。","No, Tom’s life went along well enough, especially in summer.He only begged just enough to save himself, for the laws against mendicancy were stringent, and the penalties heavy; so he put in a good deal of his time listening to good Father Andrew’s charming old tales and legends about giants and fairies, dwarfs and genii, and enchanted castles, and gorgeous kings and princes.His head grew to be full of these wonderful things, and many a night as he lay in the dark on his scant and offensive straw, tired, hungry, and smarting from a thrashing, he unleashed his imagination and soon forgot his aches and pains in delicious picturings to himself of the charmed life of a petted prince in a regal palace.One desire came in time to haunt him day and night: it was to see a real prince, with his own eyes.He spoke of it once to some of his Offal Court comrades; but they jeered him and scoffed him so unmercifully that he was glad to keep his dream to himself after that."
"他经常读牧师的旧书，还让牧师给他讲解、详述书中的内容。久而久之，他做的梦和读的书使他产生了某些变化。他梦里的人们是那么优雅，以至于他开始为自己的衣衫褴褛和肮脏而悲叹，希望自己能变得干净些，穿得更体面些。他照旧在泥沟里玩耍，玩得也很快乐，但他在泰晤士河里胡乱泼水可不仅是为了好玩，他开始发现其中的附加价值，因为水可以清洗去污。","He often read the priest’s old books and got him to explain and enlarge upon them.His dreamings and readings worked certain changes in him, by-and-by.His dream-people were so fine that he grew to lament his shabby clothing and his dirt, and to wish to be clean and better clad.He went on playing in the mud just the same and enjoying it, too; but, instead of splashing around in the Thames solely for the fun of it, he began to find an added value in it because of the washings and cleansings it afforded."
"汤姆总能发现齐普赛街的五朔节花柱周围和集市上有事发生。而且时不时地，会有某个有名的倒霉蛋通过陆路或水路被押往伦敦塔坐牢。这时，他和其他伦敦人就有机会看一场军队游行。夏日的一天，他看见可怜的安妮·艾斯丘和三个男人在史密斯菲尔德的刑柱上被烧死，还听到一位前主教对他们布道。而他对那布道并不感兴趣。是的，总的说来，汤姆的生活还是丰富多样、相当愉快的。","Tom could always find something going on around the Maypole in Cheapside, and at the fairs; and now and then he and the rest of London had a chance to see a military parade when some famous unfortunate was carried prisoner to the Tower, by land or boat.One summer’s day he saw poor Anne Askew and three men burned at the stake in Smithfield, and heard an ex-Bishop preach a sermon to them which did not interest him.Yes, Tom’s life was varied and pleasant enough, on the whole."
"日复一日，汤姆读的书和他有关王子的生活的梦对他产生了强烈的影响，他不知不觉开始扮演起王子来。他的讲话和仪态变得出奇地正式而有威严，他亲密的伙伴对此感到无限钦佩，而且又觉得好笑。但现在，汤姆在这些年轻人中的影响开始一天天增强，最后,他们都怀着一种好奇的敬畏仰视他，认为他高人一等。他好像知道很多事情！他可以做出和讲出这么不可思议的事情！而且，他是那么深刻而有智慧！汤姆的语言、汤姆的行为，都被男孩子们说给了家里的大人听。不久，这些大人也开始谈论汤姆·坎蒂，把他视为最有天赋、不同寻常的人。成人们向汤姆请教疑难问题的解决方法，并常常惊讶于他决策的机智和巧妙。其实，所有认识他的人都把他当成英雄，除了他自己的家人——只有他们没看出他有什么了不起的。　","By-and-by Tom’s reading and dreaming about princely life wrought such a strong effect upon him that he began to ACT the prince, unconsciously.His speech and manners became curiously ceremonious and courtly, to the vast admiration and amusement of his intimates.But Tom’s influence among these young people began to grow now, day by day; and in time he came to be looked up to, by them, with a sort of wondering awe, as a superior being.He seemed to know so much! And he could do and say such marvellous things!And withal, he was so deep and wise!Tom’s remarks, and Tom’s performances, were reported by the boys to their elders; and these, also, presently began to discuss Tom Canty, and to regard him as a most gifted and extraordinary creature.Full-grown people brought their perplexities to Tom for solution, and were often astonished at the wit and wisdom of his decisions.In fact he was become a hero to all who knew him except his own family—these, only, saw nothing in him."
"不久以后，汤姆秘密地组织了一个宫廷！他扮王子，他亲密的伙伴们有的扮侍卫，有的扮内臣，有的扮武官，有的扮勋爵，有的扮宫女，还有的扮皇族。每天，他们都用复杂的仪式接待这位假王子，这些仪式都是汤姆从传奇书上学的。每天，皇家议会上都要讨论假王国的大事,假王子阁下每日都会给他想象中的军队、海军和总督颁布命令。","Privately, after a while, Tom organised a royal court!He was the prince; his special comrades were guards, chamberlains, equerries, lords and ladies in waiting, and the royal family.Daily the mock prince was received with elaborate ceremonials borrowed by Tom from his romantic readings; daily the great affairs of the mimic kingdom were discussed in the royal council, and daily his mimic highness issued decrees to his imaginary armies, navies, and viceroyalties."
"随后，他就衣衫褴褛地出去讨几个法寻，吃些可怜的面包皮，照例挨几巴掌打和几句骂，然后舒展地躺在他那把肮脏的稻草上，继续做他那空洞而富丽堂皇的梦。","After which, he would go forth in his rags and beg a few farthings, eat his poor crust, take his customary cuffs and abuse, and then stretch himself upon his handful of foul straw, and resume his empty grandeurs in his dreams."
"他想见见活生生的真正的王子，哪怕就一次。他的这种愿望还是一天天、一周周地愈加强烈，直到它终于完全吞噬了别的愿望，成为他生命中唯一的心愿。","And still his desire to look just once upon a real prince, in the flesh, grew upon him, day by day, and week by week, until at last it absorbed all other desires, and became the one passion of his life."
"一月份的某天，他像往常一样沿街乞讨，在民辛巷和小东便宜街周围一带沮丧地走来走去。几个小时过去了，他光着脚，冻得冰冷。他朝小餐馆的窗户里望去，向往着摆在那儿的那些可怕的猪肉馅饼和其它那些要命的菜——因为对他来说，这些都是给天使享用的美味，更确切地说，它们闻起来如此——他还从没有福气拥有和品尝过。天下着冰冷的蒙蒙细雨，空气阴沉——那是让人忧郁的一天。晚上，汤姆回到家，浑身湿透了，又累又饿。他父亲和奶奶不可能察觉不到他悲惨的状况，不可能不可怜他——用他们的方式可怜他。于是，他们立刻轻轻打了他几下，让他睡觉去了。疼痛、饥饿，还有楼里不断的打骂声让他好半天睡不着。但最后，他的思绪飘到了远处浪漫的王国，在年轻王子们的陪伴下睡着了。王子们穿金戴银，住在宽敞的宫殿里，有仆人向他们请安，或快速地执行他们下达的命令。然后，像往常一样，他梦见自己是位小王子。","One January day, on his usual begging tour, he tramped despondently up and down the region round about Mincing Lane and Little East Cheap, hour after hour, bare-footed and cold, looking in at cook-shop windows and longing for the dreadful pork-pies and other deadly inventions displayed there—for to him these were dainties fit for the angels; that is, judging by the smell, they were—for it had never been his good luck to own and eat one.There was a cold drizzle of rain; the atmosphere was murky; it was a melancholy day.At night Tom reached home so wet and tired and hungry that it was not possible for his father and grandmother not to observe his forlorn condition and not be moved—after their fashion; wherefore they gave him a brisk cuffing at once and sent him to bed.For a long time his pain and hunger, and the swearing and fighting going on in the building, kept him awake; but at last his thoughts drifted away to far, romantic lands, and he fell asleep in the company of jewelled and gilded princelings who live in vast palaces, and had servants salaaming before them or flying to execute their orders.And then, as usual, he dreamed that he was a princeling himself."
"整个晚上，他都沉浸在他的王国的荣耀里：灯火通明中，他走在许多贵族与小姐之间，呼吸着芳香，尽情地倾听着怡人的音乐。闪亮的人群分开来给他让路，恭敬地向他行礼。他一会儿微笑，一会儿点一点他高贵的头。","All night long the glories of his royal estate shone upon him; he moved among great lords and ladies, in a blaze of light, breathing perfumes, drinking in delicious music, and answering the reverent obeisances of the glittering throng as it parted to make way for him, with here a smile, and there a nod of his princely head."
"可是，当他早上醒来，看着自己周围恶劣的环境时，他的梦产生了与往常一样的影响——它把他所处环境的肮脏放大了一千倍。随后,痛苦、心碎和眼泪一一袭来。","And when he awoke in the morning and looked upon the wretchedness about him, his dream had had its usual effect—it had intensified the sordidness of his surroundings a thousand fold.Then came bitterness, and heart-break, and tears."
"第三章 汤姆面见王子","Chapter III  Tom’s Meeting with the Prince"
"汤姆起床时还很饿。他悠闲地走着，将饥饿赶跑了，但他脑子里全是晚上梦境里那些模模糊糊的辉煌景象。他在城里到处闲逛，几乎没注意走到了哪里，也没注意周围正发生的事情。人们推挤他，还有人对他恶言恶语，但这个正在沉思的男孩丝毫没注意。过了一会儿，他发现自己到了神庙酒吧，那是他朝那个方向走过的、离他家最远的地方。他停下脚步，思索了片刻，然后又陷入了幻想，走到了伦敦城墙的外面。路已经不再是乡村的小路，由于路旁有些不怎么协调的建筑而应被称为街道。因为，虽然路的一边是一排相当紧凑的房子，另一边却只有几座分散的宏伟建筑。那是富裕的贵族住的宫殿，有很大很美的庄园延伸至河边——这些庄园现在堆满了许多亩冷冰冰的砖块和石头。","Tom got up hungry, and sauntered hungry away, but with his thoughts busy with the shadowy splendours of his night’s dreams.He wandered here and there in the city, hardly noticing where he was going, or what was happening around him.People jostled him, and some gave him rough speech; but it was all lost on the musing boy.By-and-by he found himself at Temple Bar, the farthest from home he had ever travelled in that direction.He stopped and considered a moment, then fell into his imaginings again, and passed on outside the walls of London.The Strand had ceased to be a country-road then, and regarded itself as a street, but by a strained construction; for, though there was a tolerably compact row of houses on one side of it, there were only some scattered great buildings on the other, these being palaces of rich nobles, with ample and beautiful grounds stretching to the river—grounds that are now closely packed with grim acres of brick and stone."
"不一会儿，汤姆发现了查林庄园。他在一位早已过世的国王在那里修建的美丽的十字街歇息了一下，然后又沿着一条安静、美丽的路溜达，经过红衣大主教那庄严的宫殿，走向了远处一座威严、雄伟得多的宫殿——威斯敏斯特。汤姆又惊又喜地望着这巨大的石制建筑，望着那展开的配楼、褶皱的棱堡和角楼，还有那庞大的石门。门口有镀金的栅栏和一排壮观的大花岗岩狮子，还有其他英国皇室的标志和象征。他內心的愿望终于要实现了吗？这里确实是国王的宫殿。如果老天乐意的话，他怎么会不希望现在就能见到王子——活生生的王子？","Tom discovered Charing Village presently, and rested himself at the beautiful cross built there by a bereaved king of earlier days; then idled down a quiet, lovely road, past the great cardinal’s stately palace, toward a far more mighty and majestic palace beyond—Westminster.Tom stared in glad wonder at the vast pile of masonry, the wide-spreading wings, the frowning bastions and turrets, the huge stone gateway, with its gilded bars and its magnificent array of colossal granite lions, and other the signs and symbols of English royalty.Was the desire of his soul to be satisfied at last?Here, indeed, was a king’s palace.Might he not hope to see a prince now—a prince of flesh and blood, if Heaven were willing?"
"镀金大门的两侧各立着一尊活雕像——也就是说，一个站得笔直的、威严的、一动不动的守卫，从头到脚都穿戴着闪光的钢盔铁甲。许多乡村百姓和城里人都恭敬地站在远处，他们在等机会看一眼可能出来的皇室成员。华丽的马车从皇家院墙上的另外几个雄伟的大门中进进出出，马车里坐着华丽的人们，外面是华丽的仆人。","At each side of the gilded gate stood a living statue—that is to say, an erect and stately and motionless man-at-arms, clad from head to heel in shining steel armour.At a respectful distance were many country folk, and people from the city, waiting for any chance glimpse of royalty that might offer.Splendid carriages, with splendid people in them and splendid servants outside, were arriving and departing by several other noble gateways that pierced the royal enclosure."
"可怜的小汤姆穿着破衣烂衫往前走，慢慢地、怯怯地走过那些守卫，心砰砰地跳着，心中浮起希望。忽然，他透过金栅栏看到了一幕景象，差点高兴得叫出声来。里面有个英俊的男孩子，由于户外健身运动和锻炼，他的皮肤晒成了棕褐色；全身穿着美丽的绸缎衣服，配有闪光的珠宝；臀部系着一把镶嵌宝石的小刀剑；脚上穿着精致的、红色鞋跟的半高筒靴；头上戴着一顶活泼的深红帽子，帽子上一颗硕大而耀眼的宝石上系着往下垂的羽毛。几位衣着华丽的绅士在一旁站着——是他的仆人，这毫无疑问。啊！他是一位王子——一位王子，一位活生生的王子，一位真正的王子——一点儿疑问都没有。这个贫儿心里的祈祷终于有了回应。","Poor little Tom, in his rags, approached, and was moving slowly and timidly past the sentinels, with a beating heart and a rising hope, when all at once he caught sight through the golden bars of a spectacle that almost made him shout for joy.Within was a comely boy, tanned and brown with sturdy outdoor sports and exercises, whose clothing was all of lovely silks and satins, shining with jewels; at his hip a little jewelled sword and dagger; dainty buskins on his feet, with red heels; and on his head a jaunty crimson cap, with drooping plumes fastened with a great sparkling gem.Several gorgeous gentlemen stood near—his servants, without a doubt.Oh!He was a prince—a prince, a living prince, a real prince—without the shadow of a question; and the prayer of the pauper-boy’s heart was answered at last."
"汤姆激动得呼吸急促，既惊奇又高兴地睁大了眼睛。他的脑瓜里立刻只剩下了一个愿望，那就是接近王子，好好地、尽情地看他。还没反应过来是怎么回事，他的脸就已经贴到门栅栏上了。一瞬间，一名士兵已经粗鲁地把他抓起来扔了出去。他落在那群目瞪口呆地观看着的乡巴佬和伦敦闲人中，只觉得天旋地转。这士兵说：","Tom’s breath came quick and short with excitement, and his eyes grew big with wonder and delight.Everything gave way in his mind instantly to one desire: that was to get close to the prince, and have a good, devouring look at him.Before he knew what he was about, he had his face against the gate-bars.The next instant one of the soldiers snatched him rudely away, and sent him spinning among the gaping crowd of country gawks and London idlers.The soldier said,—"
"“小心点，你这小叫花子！”","“Mind thy manners, thou young beggar!”"
"人群发出了讥讽和嘲笑声，但是年轻的王子跑到大门口，脸涨得通红，眼中闪着愤怒，大声喊道：“你怎么敢这样对待一个可怜的小伙子？你怎么敢这样对待我父王最卑微的国民？打开门，让他进来！”","The crowd jeered and laughed; but the young prince sprang to the gate with his face flushed, and his eyes flashing with indignation, and cried out,—“How dar’st thou use a poor lad like that?How dar’st thou use the King my father’s meanest subject so?Open the gates, and let him in!”"
"您真应该看看那些善变的人们拽下帽子时的样子。您真应该听听他们欢呼：“威尔士王子万岁！”","You should have seen that fickle crowd snatch off their hats then.You should have heard them cheer, and shout, “Long lives the Prince of Wales!”"
"士兵们举戟致敬，打开了大门，小贫儿王子进门时，他们又举戟致敬。贫儿王子走了进去，与无限富足的王子牵手，身上的破衣烂衫飘动着。","The soldiers presented arms with their halberds, opened the gates, and presented again as the little Prince of Poverty passed in, in his fluttering rags, to join hands with the Prince of Limitless Plenty."
"爱德华·都铎说：","Edward Tudor said—"
"“你看上去又累又饿，你受虐待了。跟我来。”","“Thou lookest tired and hungry: thou’st been treated ill.Come with me.”"
"有六个随从冲上前去——我不知道怎么说，但毫无疑问，他们是去干涉的。但是,王子适时高贵地挥了挥手让他们退下，他们便一动不动地停在原地，像很多尊雕像一样。爱德华将汤姆带到宫殿里一间富丽堂皇的厅堂，他管它叫他的内阁。王子一道命令，于是，一桌汤姆除了在书上外从未见过的饭菜端了上来。王子以皇家的优雅而有教养的方式打发了仆人，好让他卑微的客人不会因为他们的评头论足而尴尬。然后，王子坐在一旁，在汤姆吃饭的时候问了他几个问题。","Half a dozen attendants sprang forward to—I don’t know what; interfere, no doubt.But they were waved aside with a right royal gesture, and they stopped stock still where they were, like so many statues.Edward took Tom to a rich apartment in the palace, which he called his cabinet.By his command a repast was brought such as Tom had never encountered before except in books.The prince, with princely delicacy and breeding, sent away the servants, so that his humble guest might not be embarrassed by their critical presence; then he sat near by, and asked questions while Tom ate."
"“你叫什么名字，伙伴？”","“What is thy name, lad?”"
"“汤姆·坎蒂，回禀王子殿下。”","“Tom Canty, an’ it please thee, sir.”"
"“这是个奇怪的名字。","“’Tis an odd one."
"你住哪儿？”","Where dost live?”"
"“住城里，回禀王子殿下。布丁巷外的垃圾大院。”","“In the city, please thee, sir.Offal Court, out of Pudding Lane.”"
"“垃圾大院！真是又一个奇怪的名字。有父母吗？”","“Offal Court!Truly ’tis another odd one.Hast parents?”"
"“我有父母，殿下，还有一个对我漠不关心又矫揉造作的祖母，如果这么说很无礼，请上帝原谅——还有一对双胞胎姐姐，娜恩和贝特。”","“Parents have I, sir, and a grand-dam likewise that is but indifferently precious to me, God forgive me if it be offence to say it—also twin sisters, Nan and Bet.”"
"“那么我想，你祖母对你不太好吧？”","“Then is thy grand-dam not over kind to thee, I take it?”"
"“她对任何人都不好，禀告王子。她内心狠毒，整天作恶多端。”","“Neither to any other is she, so please your worship.She hath a wicked heart, and worketh evil all her days.”"
"“她虐待你了吗？”","“Doth she mistreat thee?”"
"“她睡觉或醉得不省人事的时候不会打我，但她醒了之后又会补上，好好揍我一顿。”","“There be times that she stayeth her hand, being asleep or overcome with drink; but when she hath her judgment clear again, she maketh it up to me with goodly beatings.”"
"小王子的眼睛里闪现出愤怒的神情，他大喊道：","A fierce look came into the little prince’s eyes, and he cried out—"
"“什么！打你？”","“What!Beatings?”"
"“啊，的确，是，禀告王子殿下。”","“Oh, indeed, yes, please you, sir.”"
"“打你！——你这样又弱又小。你听着：晚上之前，她就会被送进伦敦塔。我父王——”","“BEATINGS!—and thou so frail and little.Hark ye: before the night come, she shall hie her to the Tower.The King my father”—"
"“其实，您忘了，殿下，她地位低微。只有地位高的人能进伦敦塔。”","“In sooth, you forget, sir, her low degree.The Tower is for the great alone.”"
"“对，确实。我没想到这个。我会考虑她的处罚方式的。你父亲对你好吗？”","“True, indeed.I had not thought of that.I will consider of her punishment.Is thy father kind to thee?”"
"“跟坎蒂奶奶差不多，殿下。”","“Not more than Gammer Canty, sir.”"
"“也许，父亲们都一样。我父亲可没有什么好脾气。他打起人来手很重，但舍不得打我：可说真的，他也不是每次都能说几句就饶了我的。你母亲对你怎么样？”","“Fathers be alike, mayhap.Mine hath not a doll’s temper.He smiteth with a heavy hand, yet spareth me: he spareth me not always with his tongue, though, sooth to say.How doth thy mother use thee?”"
"“她人很好，殿下，没给我任何伤心或疼痛。 这一点上，娜恩和贝特跟她一样。”","“She is good, sir, and giveth me neither sorrow nor pain of any sort.And Nan and Bet are like to her in this.”"
"“这两个姐姐几岁了？”","“How old be these?”"
"“十五，回禀王子殿下。”","“Fifteen an’ it please you, sir.”"
"“我姐姐伊丽莎白公主十四岁了，我堂妹简·格雷郡主和我同年，又好看又亲切。但是我妹妹玛丽公主就一幅阴郁的样子——你呢，你的姐姐们是不是禁止自己的仆人笑，唯恐罪恶毁灭她们的灵魂？”","“The Lady Elizabeth, my sister, is fourteen, and the Lady Jane Grey, my cousin, is of mine own age, and comely and gracious withal; but my sister the Lady Mary, with her gloomy mien and—Look you: do thy sisters forbid their servants to smile, lest the sin destroy their souls?”"
"“她们？哦，殿下，您以为她们有仆人啊？”","“They?Oh, dost think, sir, that they have servants?”"
"小王子神情严肃地凝视了小贫儿一会儿，然后说：","The little prince contemplated the little pauper gravely a moment, then said—"
"“请问，为什么没有呢？晚上谁帮她们脱衣服呢？起床时,谁给她们穿衣服呢？”","“And prithee, why not?Who helpeth them undress at night?Who attireth them when they rise?”"
"“没有人，殿下。难道要她们脱掉那件衣服睡觉——像野兽一样吗？”","“None, sir.Would’st have them take off their garment, and sleep without—like the beasts?”"
"“她们的那件衣服！她们只有一件吗？”","“Their garment!Have they but one?”"
"“哦，尊敬的殿下，她们要那么多衣服有什么用？真的，她们一个人可没有两个身体。”","“Ah, good your worship, what would they do with more?Truly they have not two bodies each.”"
"“真是古怪又不可思议的想法！请原谅，我不是有意笑的。但是你善良的娜恩和贝特将会有足够的衣服和仆人，而且马上就会有，我的侍从大臣会办理这件事的。不，不用谢我，小事一桩。你很会讲话，言语间有种自然而然的优雅。上过学吗？”","“It is a quaint and marvellous thought!Thy pardon, I had not meant to laugh.But thy good Nan and thy Bet shall have raiment and lackeys enow, and that soon, too: my cofferer shall look to it.No, thank me not; ’tis nothing.Thou speakest well; thou hast an easy grace in it.Art learned?”"
"“我不知道算不算学过，殿下。是那位好心的安德鲁神父教我的，他出于善意教我他书里的东西。”","“I know not if I am or not, sir.The good priest that is called Father Andrew taught me, of his kindness, from his books.”"
"“你懂拉丁文吧？”","“Know’st thou the Latin?”"
"“恐怕只懂一点点，殿下。”","“But scantly, sir, I doubt.”"
"“学吧，伙伴，只是开始学的时候难而已。希腊文更难，但是我想，对伊丽莎白公主和我堂妹来说，这些语言或任何其他语言都不难。你应该听听那些小姐们说那些语言！不过，跟我讲讲你的垃圾大院吧。你在那儿过得快乐吗？”","“Learn it, lad: ’tis hard only at first.The Greek is harder; but neither these nor any tongues else, I think, are hard to the Lady Elizabeth and my cousin.Thou should’st hear those damsels at it!But tell me of thy Offal Court.Hast thou a pleasant life there?”"
"“说真的，是快乐的，回禀王子殿下，除了饿肚子的时候。那里有木偶表演啦，猴子表演啦——哦，真是些滑稽的东西！还穿得那么华丽！——有些表演里，它们真的是又喊又打直到大家都被杀死，那么好看，却只需要花一个法寻——不过，讨一个法寻是非常难的，尊敬的殿下。”","“In truth, yes, so please you, sir, save when one is hungry.There be Punch-and-Judy shows, and monkeys—oh such antic creatures! and so bravely dressed!—and there be plays wherein they that play do shout and fight till all are slain, and ’tis so fine to see, and costeth but a farthing—albeit ’tis main hard to get the farthing, please your worship.”"
"“再多讲些。”","“Tell me more.”"
"“我们垃圾大院的孩子们真的会拿着棍棒互打，有时像那些学徒似的。”","“We lads of Offal Court do strive against each other with the cudgel, like to the fashion of the ’prentices, sometimes.”"
"王子的眼睛眨了眨。他说：","The prince’s eyes flashed.Said he—"
"“哎呀，我怎么会不喜欢。再多讲些。”","“Marry, that would not I mislike.Tell me more.”"
"“我们赛跑，殿下，看我们中谁跑的最快。”","“We strive in races, sir, to see who of us shall be fleetest.”"
"“我也喜欢这个。接着讲。”","“That would I like also.Speak on.”"
"“殿下，夏天时，我们在渠里和河里蹚水、游泳，每个人都躲着旁边的伙伴，朝他泼水，还潜水、喊叫、摔跤——”","“In summer, sir, we wade and swim in the canals and in the river, and each doth duck his neighbour, and splatter him with water, and dive and shout and tumble and—”"
"“要是能这么玩一次，要献出我父亲的王国都值得！请接着讲。”","“’Twould be worth my father’s kingdom but to enjoy it once!Prithee go on.”"
"“我们在齐普塞街五朔节花柱旁唱歌跳舞；我们在沙子里玩，大家都往边上的伙伴身上堆沙子；有时候我们做泥糕点——啊，可爱的泥巴，它的样子并不能讨世界上所有人的喜欢！——我们确实会快活地在泥沼中打滚，殿下，恕我冒昧。”","“We dance and sing about the Maypole in Cheapside; we play in the sand, each covering his neighbour up; and times we make mud pastry—oh the lovely mud, it hath not its like for delightfulness in all the world!—we do fairly wallow in the mud, sir, saving your worship’s presence.”"
"“啊，请不用多讲了，这已经非常好了！如果我能穿上你这样的衣服，光着脚在泥沼里放肆玩一回，哪怕就一回，而没人责备或禁止我的行为的话，我甚至可以放弃王冠！”","“Oh, prithee, say no more, ’tis glorious!If that I could but clothe me in raiment like to thine, and strip my feet, and revel in the mud once, just once, with none to rebuke me or forbid, meseemeth I could forego the crown!”"
"“如果我能有一回穿上，亲爱的殿下，像您穿的那样——就一回——”","“And if that I could clothe me once, sweet sir, as thou art clad—just once—”"
"“啊，你喜欢这样吗？那我们就换换吧。脱掉你的破衣烂衫，穿上这些华丽的衣服，伙伴！虽然这是暂时的快乐，但我的热情丝毫不会减少。我们只是暂时调换，在任何麻烦出现之前再换回来。”","“Oho, would’st like it?Then so shall it be.Doff thy rags, and don these splendours, lad!It is a brief happiness, but will be not less keen for that.We will have it while we may, and change again before any come to molest.”"
"几分钟后，小威尔士王子穿上了汤姆那飘动的破衣服，小贫儿王子则换上了皇家华贵的羽毛装束。两个人一块儿站到大镜子前，瞧，真是奇迹啊，看起来似乎一点儿变化都没有！他们盯着对方看，照照镜子，又望望对方。终于，迷惑的小王子开口道：","A few minutes later the little Prince of Wales was garlanded with Tom’s fluttering odds and ends, and the little Prince of Pauperdom was tricked out in the gaudy plumage of royalty.The two went and stood side by side before a great mirror, and lo, a miracle: there did not seem to have been any change made!They stared at each other, then at the glass, then at each other again.At last the puzzled princeling said—"
"“你觉得怎么样？”","“What dost thou make of this?”"
"“啊，尊敬的殿下，不要叫我回答。我这种地位的人不适合讲这种话的。”","“Ah, good your worship, require me not to answer.It is not meet that one of my degrees should utter the thing.”"
"“那么——我——来说。你的头发、眼睛、声音和举止、身形和身高、脸蛋和神情都和我一模一样。如果我们不穿衣服，没有人能分得清哪个是你，哪个是威尔士王子。而且，因为我穿上了你原先穿的衣服，我似乎应该能够更深切地体会刚才你被那粗暴的士兵——哎呀，你手上那个是不是伤痕？”","“Then will – I – utter it.Thou hast the same hair, the same eyes, the same voice and manner, the same form and stature, the same face and countenance that I bear.Fared we forth naked, there is none could say which was you, and which the Prince of Wales.And, now that I am clothed as thou wert clothed, it seemeth I should be able the more nearly to feel as thou didst when the brute soldier—Hark ye, is not this a bruise upon your hand?”"
"“是的。不过这没什么，殿下您知道，那可怜的士兵——”","“Yes; but it is a slight thing, and your worship knoweth that the poor man-at-arms—”"
"“住嘴！那是件可耻的、残酷的事情！”小王子跺着光脚丫喊道，“如果国王——你一步都别动，等我回来！这是命令！”","“Peace!It was a shameful thing and a cruel!” cried the little prince, stamping his bare foot.“If the King—Stir not a step till I come again!It is a command!”"
"他立刻抓起放在桌子上的一件对国家至关重要的东西收了起来，然后穿着旗子般的破旧衣服跑出门外，飞奔着穿过宫殿院子。他脸上发热，两眼放光。一跑到那扇巨大的门前，他就抓住栅栏使劲摇晃，并喊道：","In a moment he had snatched up and put away an article of national importance that lay upon a table, and was out at the door and flying through the palace grounds in his bannered rags, with a hot face and glowing eyes.As soon as he reached the great gate, he seized the bars, and tried to shake them, shouting—"
"“开门！把大门打开！”","“Open!Unbar the gates!”"
"先前虐待汤姆的守卫立刻遵从了命令。王子刚冲出大门，憋了王子一肚子气的守卫就给了他一记响亮的耳光，打得他晕乎乎地退到了路面上。那守卫还说：","The soldier that had maltreated Tom obeyed promptly; and as the prince burst through the portal, half-smothered with royal wrath, the soldier fetched him a sounding box on the ear that sent him whirling to the roadway, and said—"
"“活该，你这小叫花子，全是因为你，我才被殿下训了一顿！”","“Take that, thou beggar’s spawn, for what thou got’st me from his Highness!”"
"人群哄堂大笑。王子从泥沟里爬出来，愤怒地朝守卫走去，大声道：","The crowd roared with laughter.The prince picked himself out of the mud, and made fiercely at the sentry, shouting—"
"“我是威尔士王子，我本人是神圣不可冒犯的。你竟敢出手打我，你要被绞死的！”","“I am the Prince of Wales, my person is sacred; and thou shalt hang for laying thy hand upon me!”"
"这位士兵举戟致敬，讽刺地说：","The soldier brought his halberd to a present-arms and said mockingly—"
"“向仁慈的殿下致敬。”又转而怒道，“滚开，你这个发了疯的废物！”","“I salute your gracious Highness.”Then angrily—“Be off, thou crazy rubbish!”"
"此时，讥笑的人群向可怜的小王子凑过来，沿路把他推向远处，一边驱赶着他，一边喊：“给王子殿下让路！给威尔士王子让路！”","Here the jeering crowd closed round the poor little prince, and hustled him far down the road, hooting him, and shouting—“Way for his Royal Highness!Way for the Prince of Wales!”"
"第四章 王子开始遇到麻烦","Chapter IV The Prince’s Troubles Begin"
"这帮乌合之众数小时来一直追赶小王子，找他麻烦。最后，他们终于离去，剩下了他自己。只要他还能够冲这群暴徒发火，还能够王子般地威胁他们，向他们下达那些在他们看来很好笑的命令，他就显得很有趣。但当他终于累得说不出话时，他对折磨他的人群就再也没用处了，于是他们就到其他地方寻乐子去了。现在，他四下环顾，却无法认出这是什么地方。他在伦敦城里——他只知道这些。他漫无目的地继续走，不一会儿，房子变窄了，行人少了。王子在小溪里洗了洗流血的脚，当时那条小溪流过的地方如今成了法灵顿街。他休息了片刻，然后继续走，不一会儿，他来到一块空旷的地方，只有几所房子和一座宏伟的教堂分散其间。他认出了这座教堂。周围到处都是脚手架，还有一大群工人——教堂正在进行大规模的修缮。王子立刻振作了起来——他觉得现在他的麻烦结束了。他心想：“这是古老的格雷弗利尔斯教堂，是我父王从修道士那里要过来，供那些贫穷的、被遗弃的孩子们永久居住的，还给它起了个新名字，叫救世主教堂。他们一定会十分高兴地招待曾经对他们如此大方的人的儿子，而且会更加热情，因为这个儿子本人正与今天、或今后都永远住在这里的人一样可怜和无助。”","After hours of persistent pursuit and persecution, the little prince was at last deserted by the rabble and left to himself.As long as he had been able to rage against the mob, and threaten it royally, and royally utter commands that were good stuff to laugh at, he was very entertaining; but when weariness finally forced him to be silent, he was no longer of use to his tormentors, and they sought amusement elsewhere.He looked about him, now, but could not recognise the locality.He was within the city of London—that was all he knew.He moved on, aimlessly, and in a little while the houses thinned, and the passers-by were infrequent.He bathed his bleeding feet in the brook which flowed then where Farringdon Street now is; rested a few moments, then passed on, and presently came upon a great space with only a few scattered houses in it, and a prodigious church.He recognised this church.Scaffoldings were about, everywhere, and swarms of workmen; for it was undergoing elaborate repairs.The prince took heart at once—he felt that his troubles were at an end, now.He said to himself, “It is the ancient Grey Friars’ Church, which the king my father hath taken from the monks and given for a home for ever for poor and forsaken children, and new-named it Christ’s Church.Right gladly will they serve the son of him who hath done so generously by them—and the more that that son is himself as poor and as forlorn as any that be sheltered here this day, or ever shall be.”"
"他很快到了一群男孩子中间，他们有的在跑着，跳着，玩着球或者青蛙跳，还有的在独自玩耍，也一样吵吵闹闹。他们穿着相同的衣服，是那种当时在仆人和学徒中流行的打扮——人人头上都戴着一顶茶碟大小的扁平的黑帽，帽子非常小，不能用来遮挡，也算不上装饰品。头发从帽子下方成片垂下，直到额头中间，参差不齐地直剪了一圈。脖子上系着教士领带，贴身的蓝色长外衣一直垂到了膝盖或更下面。袖子肥大，腰间一条红色宽腰带，亮黄色的长筒袜用吊袜带拉到膝盖上方，脚上是带大金属扣子的短筒靴。这身衣服真是丑得可以。","He was soon in the midst of a crowd of boys who were running, jumping, playing at ball and leap-frog, and otherwise disporting themselves, and right noisily, too.They were all dressed alike, and in the fashion which in that day prevailed among serving-men and ’prentices—that is to say, each had on the crown of his head a flat black cap about the size of a saucer, which was not useful as a covering, it being of such scanty dimensions, neither was it ornamental; from beneath it the hair fell, unparted, to the middle of the forehead, and was cropped straight around; a clerical band at the neck; a blue gown that fitted closely and hung as low as the knees or lower; full sleeves; a broad red belt; bright yellow stockings, gartered above the knees; low shoes with large metal buckles.It was a sufficiently ugly costume."
"男孩子们停下不玩了，都围到王子旁边。王子用天生的庄严的语气说道：","The boys stopped their play and flocked about the prince, who said with native dignity—"
"“好伙伴们，通报你们院长一声，就说威尔士王子爱德华想与他会谈。”","“Good lads, say to your master that Edward Prince of Wales desireth speech with him.”"
"这引起了一片叫喊声，一个粗鲁的家伙说道：","A great shout went up at this, and one rude fellow said—"
"“哎呀，你是殿下的信使吗，乞丐？”","“Marry, art thou his grace’s messenger, beggar?”"
"王子气得涨红了脸，迅速地把他敏捷的手伸向臀后，可那边什么也没有。接着是一阵哄笑，一个男孩说道：","The prince’s face flushed with anger, and his ready hand flew to his hip, but there was nothing there.There was a storm of laughter, and one boy said—"
"“你们看到了吗？他以为他有剑呢，好像自己真是王子似的。”","“Didst mark that?He fancied he had a sword—belike he is the prince himself.”"
"这句俏皮话引来了更多的笑声。可怜的爱德华骄傲地挺直身子，说道：","This sally brought more laughter.Poor Edward drew himself up proudly and said—"
"“我是王子。你们靠着我父王的慷慨生存，这样对我是不合适的。”","“I am the prince; and it ill beseemeth you that feed upon the king my father’s bounty to use me so.”"
"这真是太有趣了，听听笑声就能知道。第一个说话的小伙子向他同伴们喊道：","This was vastly enjoyed, as the laughter testified.The youth who had first spoken, shouted to his comrades—"
"“哦，小鬼们、奴隶们、领取尊敬的殿下的父亲的抚恤金的人们，你们的礼仪呢？大家都弯腰下跪，向他的高贵姿态和皇家的破旧衣服敬礼！”","“Ho, swine, slaves, pensioners of his grace’s princely father, where be your manners?Down on your marrow bones, all of ye, and do reverence to his kingly port and royal rags!”"
"在一片喧闹的欢笑声中，他们全体跪下，真的朝着他们的猎物装模作样地敬礼。王子将最近处的男孩踢到一边，怒斥道：","With boisterous mirth they dropped upon their knees in a body and did mock homage to their prey.The prince spurned the nearest boy with his foot, and said fiercely—"
"“去你们的，等着明天，我把你们送上绞刑架！”","“Take thou that, till the morrow come and I build thee a gibbet!”"
"啊，这可不是开玩笑，这可不是好玩的。笑声立刻停止了，愤怒取而代之。十几个孩子喊道：","Ah, but this was not a joke—this was going beyond fun.The laughter ceased on the instant, and fury took its place.A dozen shouted—"
"“把他拉过来！拉到饮马池去，拉到饮马池去！狗群在哪儿呢？嘿，那里，狮子！嘿，犬牙！”","“Hale him forth!To the horse-pond, to the horse-pond!Where be the dogs?Ho, there, Lion!Ho, Fangs!”"
"接着是英国人以前从来没见过的一幕——不可冒犯的王位继承人被一群平民百姓猛打，扔到狗群里，被狗撕咬。","Then followed such a thing as England had never seen before—the sacred person of the heir to the throne rudely buffeted by plebeian hands, and set upon and torn by dogs."
"那天夜幕降临的时候，王子发现自己已到了远远的城里建筑密集的区域。他遍体鳞伤，双手在流血，破衣服上沾满了泥。他漫无目的地走啊走，越来越迷茫，他十分疲倦和虚弱，几乎再也拖不动腿了。他不再问任何问题，因为那些人给他的不是信息，而只是羞辱。他不停地自言自语：“垃圾大院——是这个名字。如果我能在力气耗尽倒下之前找到这个地方，那就得救了，因为他的家人会把我送到宫殿，证明我不是他们那里的人，而是真的王子，那我就能回到属于自己的生活。”时不时地，他会想起救世主孤儿院那些粗鲁的男孩们怎么对待他，便说：“等我做了国王，他们不仅会得到面包和住处，我还要让他们学习书上的知识，因为如果头脑和心灵都在挨饿，只是填饱肚子几乎毫无价值。我会时时刻刻想着，不能忘记今天的教训，以免我的百姓受苦，因为知识能让心灵变得温柔，孕育文雅与仁爱。”","As night drew to a close that day, the prince found himself far down in the close-built portion of the city.His body was bruised, his hands were bleeding, and his rags were all besmirched with mud.He wandered on and on, and grew more and more bewildered, and so tired and faint he could hardly drag one foot after the other.He had ceased to ask questions of anyone, since they brought him only insult instead of information.He kept muttering to himself, “Offal Court—that is the name; if I can but find it before my strength is wholly spent and I drop, then am I saved—for his people will take me to the palace and prove that I am none of theirs, but the true prince, and I shall have mine own again.”And now and then his mind reverted to his treatment by those rude Christ’s Hospital boys, and he said, “When I am king, they shall not have bread and shelter only, but also teachings out of books; for a full belly is little worth where the mind is starved, and the heart.I will keep this diligently in my remembrance, that this day’s lesson be not lost upon me, and my people suffer thereby; for learning softeneth the heart and breedeth gentleness and charity.”"
"华灯初上，天下起了雨，起了风，一个阴冷的、疾风凛凛的夜晚来了。这位无处可去的王子，无家可归的英国王位继承人继续走着，游荡到肮脏的巷子迷宫的深处。在那里，贫穷和苦难的蜂群聚集在一起。","The lights began to twinkle, it came on to rain, the wind rose, and a raw and gusty night set in.The houseless prince, the homeless heir to the throne of England, still moved on, drifting deeper into the maze of squalid alleys where the swarming hives of poverty and misery were massed together."
"突然，一个高大的醉汉抓住了他的衣领，说道：","Suddenly a great drunken ruffian collared him and said—"
"“又这么晚才回来，而且我敢说，肯定一个法寻也没带回家！要真是这样，如果我不打断你那小身板上所有的骨头，我就不是约翰·坎蒂，而是其他人了。”","“Out to this time of night again, and hast not brought a farthing home, I warrant me!If it be so, an’ I do not break all the bones in thy lean body, then am I not John Canty, but some other.”"
"王子挣开了，下意识地掸了掸弄脏了的肩膀，迫不及待地问：","The prince twisted himself loose, unconsciously brushed his profaned shoulder, and eagerly said—"
"“啊，你是他的父亲，真的吗？亲爱的上帝，保佑是这样吧——那么你就把他要回来，把我还回去！”","“Oh, art his father, truly?Sweet heaven grant it be so—then wilt thou fetch him away and restore me!”"
"“他的父亲？我不懂你是什么意思，但是我知道我是你父亲，因为你等会儿要有大事——”","“His father?I know not what thou mean’st; I but know I am thy father, as thou shalt soon have cause to—”"
"“啊，别开玩笑，别含糊其词，别等会儿！——我累了，我受伤了，我再也受不了了。送我到我父王那里去，他会让你富裕，在你最荒诞的梦里都想象不到的富裕。您相信我，相信我！——我没说谎，都是实话！——伸出你的手，救救我吧！我确实是威尔士王子！”","“Oh, jest not, palter not, delay not!—I am worn, I am wounded, I can bear no more.Take me to the king my father, and he will make thee rich beyond thy wildest dreams.Believe me, man, believe me!—I speak no lie, but only the truth!—put forth thy hand and save me!I am indeed the Prince of Wales!”"
"这个男人低头盯着他，目瞪口呆，然后摇摇头，咕哝道：","The man stared down, stupefied, upon the lad, then shook his head and muttered—"
"“完全疯了，成了疯人院里的汤姆了！”说完又揪起他的衣领，粗声粗气地笑骂道，“但是不管疯了还是没疯，我和你的坎蒂奶奶很快就会找到你骨头最软的地方，否则我就不是真正的男人！”","“Gone stark mad as any Tom o’ Bedlam!”—then collared him once more, and said with a coarse laugh and an oath, “But mad or no mad, I and thy Gammer Canty will soon find where the soft places in thy bones lie, or I’m no true man!”"
"说着，他把发疯似地挣扎的王子拖走了，消失在一个院子前，留下身后一群兴致勃勃、喧闹嘈杂的暴徒。","With this he dragged the frantic and struggling prince away, and disappeared up a front court followed by a delighted and noisy swarm of human vermin."
"第五章 汤姆做了贵族","Chapter V Tom as a Patrician"
"王子的内阁里只剩下汤姆·坎蒂一个人，他好好地利用了这个机会。他在大镜子前面左照右照，欣赏着他华丽的服饰，然后走开，模仿着王子有教养的举止，又在镜子里观察效果。随后，他拔出那把美丽的剑，鞠一躬，亲吻了刀刃，将它横在自己的胸前，就像他见过的一个高贵的骑士向伦敦塔的上尉致敬时那样。那是在五六个星期前，骑士把诺福克和萨里郡的伯爵交给上尉囚禁的时候。汤姆玩了一会儿挂在他大腿上的那把镶珠宝的匕首，又仔细观察着房间里昂贵而精美的装饰。他试坐了每一把豪华的椅子，心里想，如果垃圾大院的人能偷看一眼他的荣光，他该多自豪啊。他心里想，如果他回到家告诉他们这个奇妙的故事，他们会不会相信，又或者他们会摇摇头，说他幻想过度，结果丧失了理智。","Tom Canty, left alone in the prince’s cabinet, made good use of his opportunity.He turned himself this way and that before the great mirror, admiring his finery; then walked away, imitating the prince’s high-bred carriage, and still observing results in the glass.Next he drew the beautiful sword, and bowed, kissing the blade, and laying it across his breast, as he had seen a noble knight do, by way of salute to the lieutenant of the Tower, five or six weeks before, when delivering the great lords of Norfolk and Surrey into his hands for captivity.Tom played with the jewelled dagger that hung upon his thigh; he examined the costly and exquisite ornaments of the room; he tried each of the sumptuous chairs, and thought how proud he would be if the Offal Court herd could only peep in and see him in his grandeur.He wondered if they would believe the marvellous tale he should tell when he got home, or if they would shake their heads, and say his overtaxed imagination had at last upset his reason."
"半个小时过去了，他忽然意识到王子出去好长时间了，于是他马上开始感到孤独。很快，他开始听着，期待着，不再玩周围这些漂亮的东西，而是变得不自在，接着坐立不安，随后觉得十分痛苦。如果有人进来抓住了穿着王子衣服的他，而王子又不在场帮他解释。他们会不会立刻绞死他，过后再调查这个案件呢？他早听说大人物处理小事情是很迅速的。他越来越害怕，颤抖着轻轻打开前厅的门，决心要飞跑着去寻找王子，有了王子，就有了保护和解脱。六个衣着华丽的男仆和两个穿得像蝴蝶似的高级侍从霍地站起身来，向他深深地鞠躬。他马上退回了脚步，关上了门。他说：","At the end of half an hour it suddenly occurred to him that the prince was gone a long time; then right away he began to feel lonely; very soon he fell to listening and longing, and ceased to toy with the pretty things about him; he grew uneasy, then restless, then distressed.Suppose some one should come, and catch him in the prince’s clothes, and the prince not there to explain.Might they not hang him at once, and inquire into his case afterward?He had heard that the great were prompt about small matters.His fear rose higher and higher; and trembling he softly opened the door to the antechamber, resolved to fly and seek the prince, and, through him, protection and release.Six gorgeous gentlemen-servants and two young pages of high degree, clothed like butterflies, sprang to their feet and bowed low before him.He stepped quickly back and shut the door.He said—"
"“啊，他们嘲笑我！他们会去告密的。啊！我为什么舍弃了自己的生活，到这里来？”","“Oh, they mock at me!They will go and tell.Oh!Why came I here to cast away my life?”"
"他在地板上踱来踱去，心中充满了莫名的恐惧。他侧耳聆听，一点点动静都让他心惊胆战。不一会儿，门打开了，一个身穿绫罗的侍从说：","He walked up and down the floor, filled with nameless fears, listening, starting at every trifling sound.Presently the door swung open, and a silken page said—"
"“简·格雷郡主来了。”","“The Lady Jane Grey.”"
"门关了，一个穿着华丽、年轻甜美的姑娘跳着朝他走来。但是她忽然停住了，声音忧虑地说：","The door closed and a sweet young girl, richly clad, bounded toward him.But she stopped suddenly, and said in a distressed voice—"
"“啊，您有什么烦恼，我的殿下？”","“Oh, what aileth thee, my lord?”"
"汤姆几乎喘不过气来了，但他还是努力结结巴巴地说出：","Tom’s breath was nearly failing him; but he made shift to stammer out—"
"“啊，请您仁慈些吧！我真的不是殿下，只是城里垃圾大院的可怜的汤姆·坎蒂。请让我见见王子，尊敬的殿下会把我的破旧衣服还给我，好让我不受伤害。 啊，您仁慈些吧，救救我！”","“Ah, be merciful, thou!In sooth I am no lord, but only poor Tom Canty of Offal Court in the city.Prithee let me see the prince, and he will of his grace restore to me my rags, and let me hence unhurt.Oh, be thou merciful, and save me!”"
"这时，这个男孩已经跪下，他的眼神、高举的手，还有言语里都充满了哀求。年轻的姑娘好像被吓坏了。她叫喊道：","By this time the boy was on his knees, and supplicating with his eyes and uplifted hands as well as with his tongue.The young girl seemed horror-stricken.She cried out—"
"“噢，我的殿下，您跪下？——朝我跪！”","“O my lord, on thy knees?—and to ME!”"
"然后她惊恐地逃走了。汤姆彻底绝望了，无力地坐下，嘴里咕哝：","Then she fled away in fright; and Tom, smitten with despair, sank down, murmuring—"
"“没人帮我，没有希望了。现在他们要来抓我了吧。”","“There is no help, there is no hope.Now will they come and take me.”"
"就在他吓得瘫坐在那里时，可怕的消息迅速传遍了宫殿。耳语——因为总是耳语——从一个家仆传到另一个家仆耳朵里，从贵族老爷传到贵族太太那里，穿过长长的走廊，从一个故事到另一个故事，从一个大厅到另一个大厅，说：“王子疯了，王子疯了！”很快，每个大厅和每个大理石会堂里的一群群闪闪发光的贵族老爷和太太们，还有一群群耀眼的地位低些的大臣，都在一起认真地窃窃私语，人人脸上都是惊慌的神色。没多久，一个华丽的官员过来把这些人召集起来，庄严地宣布：","Whilst he lay there benumbed with terror, dreadful tidings were speeding through the palace.The whisper—for it was whispered always—flew from menial to menial, from lord to lady, down all the long corridors, from story to story, from saloon to saloon, “The prince hath gone mad, the prince hath gone mad!”Soon every saloon, every marble hall, had its groups of glittering lords and ladies, and other groups of dazzling lesser folk, talking earnestly together in whispers, and every face had in it dismay.Presently a splendid official came marching by these groups, making solemn proclamation—"
"“以国王的名义！","“IN THE NAME OF THE KING!"
"大家都不可听信这种伪造的愚蠢的谣言，违令者死，不可谈论此事，也不可使谣言外传。以国王的名义！”","Let none list to this false and foolish matter, upon pain of death, nor discuss the same, nor carry it abroad.In the name of the King!”"
"窃窃私语声倏地停止了，好像这些人都被打成了哑巴。","The whisperings ceased as suddenly as if the whisperers had been stricken dumb."
"不久，走廊里响起一阵嗡嗡声：“王子！看，王子来了！”","Soon there was a general buzz along the corridors, of “The prince!See, the prince comes!”"
"可怜的汤姆慢慢地穿过深深鞠躬的人群，一边努力弯腰还礼，一边谦顺地看着周围陌生的环境，眼里充满了迷茫和凄惨。几个大贵族走在他两边，让他靠着他们走，好让他的步子平稳。他后面跟着御医们和一些仆人。","Poor Tom came slowly walking past the low-bowing groups, trying to bow in return, and meekly gazing upon his strange surroundings with bewildered and pathetic eyes.Great nobles walked upon each side of him, making him lean upon them, and so steady his steps.Behind him followed the court-physicians and some servants."
"很快，汤姆到了宫殿里一间宏伟的屋子里，听到身后门关上的声音。身边站的是随他来的那些人。他面前不远处斜躺着一个很大很胖的人，脸庞宽阔柔软，表情严肃。他大大的头上头发灰白，他那像相框一样绕在脸颊周围的络腮胡子也是灰白的。他衣着华贵，但是很旧，有些地方稍有磨损。他那一条肿起的腿用绷带包扎着，下面垫了个枕头。此刻一片沉寂，所有人的脑袋都不见了，全都恭敬地低垂着，除了这个人的。这个表情严肃的病人正是令人敬畏的亨利八世。他开口说话时，脸色和缓了下来。他说道：","Presently Tom found himself in a noble apartment of the palace and heard the door close behind him.Around him stood those who had come with him.Before him, at a little distance, reclined a very large and very fat man, with a wide, pulpy face, and a stern expression.His large head was very grey; and his whiskers, which he wore only around his face, like a frame, were grey also.His clothing was of rich stuff, but old, and slightly frayed in places.One of his swollen legs had a pillow under it, and was wrapped in bandages.There was silence now; and there was no head there but was bent in reverence, except this man’s.This stern-countenanced invalid was the dread Henry VIII.He said—and his face grew gentle as he began to speak—"
"“现在怎么样，我的爱德华殿下，我的王子？你是不是存心开个令人伤心的玩笑来哄我——你仁慈的父王，这个爱你并对你好的人呢？”","“How now, my lord Edward, my prince?Hast been minded to cozen me, the good King thy father, who loveth thee, and kindly useth thee, with a sorry jest?”"
"开头讲的时候，可怜的汤姆还在听着，虽然头昏目眩，他还是尽力听着。但是当他听到“我——你仁慈的父王”几个字时，他的脸一下子变得煞白，立刻双膝跪下，好像挨了一枪似的。他举起双手，大声喊道：","Poor Tom was listening, as well as his dazed faculties would let him, to the beginning of this speech; but when the words ‘me, the good King’ fell upon his ear, his face blanched, and he dropped as instantly upon his knees as if a shot had brought him there.Lifting up his hands, he exclaimed—"
"“您是国王？那我真的完蛋了！”","“Thou the King?Then am I undone indeed!”"
"国王听了这话，似乎大吃了一惊。他的眼睛漫无目的地扫了扫众人的脸，然后茫然地落在了面前这个男孩子身上。他用非常失望的语气说道：","This speech seemed to stun the King.His eyes wandered from face to face aimlessly, then rested, bewildered, upon the boy before him.Then he said in a tone of deep disappointment—"
"“呜呼，我原相信传言与事实不符，但恐怕不是这样了。”他深深叹了口气，用温柔的语气说：“到父王这里来，孩子，你生病了。”","“Alack, I had believed the rumour disproportioned to the truth; but I fear me ’tis not so.”He breathed a heavy sigh, and said in a gentle voice, “Come to thy father, child: thou art not well.”"
"汤姆被扶了起来，走近英国国王陛下。他很谦卑，还发着抖。国王两手托住那惊恐的脸，认真地、慈爱地凝视了一会儿，好像在寻找一丝令人欣喜的恢复神志的迹象，然后他把汤姆那满头卷发的脑袋贴在胸口上，轻柔地拍了拍。过了会儿，他说：","Tom was assisted to his feet, and approached the Majesty of England, humble and trembling.The King took the frightened face between his hands, and gazed earnestly and lovingly into it awhile, as if seeking some grateful sign of returning reason there, then pressed the curly head against his breast, and patted it tenderly.Presently he said—"
"“你不认得你父王了吗，孩子？不要让我这个老人伤心，说你认得我。你确实认得我，是不是？”","“Dost not know thy father, child?Break not mine old heart; say thou know’st me.Thou DOST know me, dost thou not?”"
"“是，您是我令人敬畏的国王陛下，深得上帝保佑！”","“Yea: thou art my dread lord the King, whom God preserve!”"
"“对，对——很好——放松，不要这样直打哆嗦。这里没人会伤害你，这里所有人都只会爱你。你现在好多了，你的噩梦过去了——是不是这样？你不会再叫错自己了吧，他们说刚才你就错了？”","“True, true—that is well—be comforted, tremble not so; there is none here would hurt thee; there is none here but loves thee.Thou art better now; thy ill dream passeth—is’t not so?Thou wilt not miscall thyself again, as they say thou didst a little while agone?”"
"“我求仁慈的陛下您相信我，我说的都是实话，最令人敬畏的陛下，因为我是您最卑微的臣民，生来是个贫儿，我来到这儿是因为一件非常偶然的意外，虽然这不是我的错。我现在死还太年轻了，而您只要一句话就能救了我。啊，救救我，陛下！”","“I pray thee of thy grace believe me, I did but speak the truth, most dread lord; for I am the meanest among thy subjects, being a pauper born, and ’tis by a sore mischance and accident I am here, albeit I was therein nothing blameful.I am but young to die, and thou canst save me with one little word.Oh speak it, sir!”"
"“死？别说这个，亲爱的王子——安心，安心，你那烦燥不安的心灵——你不会死的！”","“Die?Talk not so, sweet prince—peace, peace, to thy troubled heart—thou shalt not die!”"
"汤姆扑通跪在地上，高兴地哭喊道：","Tom dropped upon his knees with a glad cry—"
"“上帝会报答您的仁慈的，哦，我的国王，上帝会保您长寿，并赐福于您的领土的！”然后，他跳起来，转身面对两位侍臣，神情愉悦地大声说：“你们听见了！我不会死的，国王说过了！”没有人动，都只是严肃而恭敬地鞠着躬，却没一个人说话。他犹豫了一下，有点困惑，然后怯怯地转向国王，说：“我现在可以走了吗？”","“God requite thy mercy, O my King, and save thee long to bless thy land!”Then springing up, he turned a joyful face toward the two lords in waiting, and exclaimed, “Thou heard’st it!I am not to die: the King hath said it!”There was no movement, save that all bowed with grave respect; but no one spoke.He hesitated, a little confused, then turned timidly toward the King, saying, “I may go now?”"
"“走？当然可以，如果你想走。不过为什么不再呆一会儿？你要去哪儿？”","“Go?Surely, if thou desirest.But why not tarry yet a little?Whither would’st go?”"
"汤姆垂下眼睛，谦卑地回答道：","Tom dropped his eyes, and answered humbly—"
"“我可能误解了，不过我确实以为我自由了，以为可以再回到我的狗窝。我在那里出生、成长，饱尝悲苦，不过，那里也有我的母亲和姐姐们，那里才是我的家。而这些华贵光彩的东西，是我不能习惯的——啊，陛下，请您放我走吧！”","“Peradventure I mistook; but I did think me free, and so was I moved to seek again the kennel where I was born and bred to misery, yet which harboureth my mother and my sisters, and so is home to me; whereas these pomps and splendours whereunto I am not used—oh, please you, sir, to let me go!”"
"国王沉默着思索了片刻，他的神情无法掩饰地越来越悲痛和不安。过了会儿，他用带着某种希望的声音说道：","The King was silent and thoughtful a while, and his face betrayed a growing distress and uneasiness.Presently he said, with something of hope in his voice—"
"“没准他只是这方面失去了神志，在其他事情上心智尚存。上帝保佑是这样吧！我们来试试。”","“Perchance he is but mad upon this one strain, and hath his wits unmarred as toucheth other matter.God send it may be so!We will make trial.”"
"然后他用拉丁文问了汤姆一个问题，汤姆也用拉丁文勉勉强强地回答了。大臣们和医生们也都表示满意。国王说道：","Then he asked Tom a question in Latin, and Tom answered him lamely in the same tongue.The lords and doctors manifested their gratification also.The King said—"
"“这与他所受的教育和能力并不符合，但这说明他的脑袋只是生病了，并未受到致命的打击。你说呢，先生？”","“’Twas not according to his schooling and ability, but showeth that his mind is but diseased, not stricken fatally.How say you, sir?”"
"被问的那个医生深深地鞠了一躬，回答道：","The physician addressed bowed low, and replied—"
"“我与您的看法一样，陛下，您推断得对。”","“It jumpeth with my own conviction, sire that thou hast divined aright.”"
"国王听了这句鼓励后，看起来很高兴，因为那是如此优秀的御医说的。他心情舒畅，继续说道：","The King looked pleased with this encouragement, coming as it did from so excellent authority, and continued with good heart—"
"“现在你们都听着，我们还要进一步试他。”","“Now mark ye all: we will try him further.”"
"他用法文问了汤姆一个问题。汤姆站着沉默了片刻，落在他身上的那么多双眼睛让他很是尴尬。他羞怯地说：","He put a question to Tom in French.Tom stood silent a moment, embarrassed by having so many eyes centred upon him, then said diffidently—"
"“我不懂这种语言，回禀陛下。”","“I have no knowledge of this tongue, so please your majesty.”"
"国王向后一倒，靠在了椅子上。侍者快步过去扶他，而他把他们撇到一边，说道：","The King fell back upon his couch.The attendants flew to his assistance; but he put them aside, and said—"
"“不要管我——只是一点儿眩晕，没什么。扶我起来！好了，可以了。到这边来，孩子。好了，把你可怜的、忧虑的脑袋靠在你父王的心口上，安安心心的。你很快就会好的，这只不过是暂时的幻觉。不要害怕，你很快就会好的。”然后他转向众随从。他温和的态度变了，眼睛里闪现了威严的光芒。他说道：","“Trouble me not—it is nothing but a scurvy faintness.Raise me!There, ’tis sufficient.Come hither, child; there, rest thy poor troubled head upon thy father’s heart, and be at peace.Thou’lt soon be well: ’tis but a passing fantasy.Fear thou not; thou’lt soon be well.”Then he turned toward the company: his gentle manner changed, and baleful lightnings began to play from his eyes.He said—"
"“你们都听着！我的儿子疯了，但这不是永久的。功课太多害他成了这个样子，还有限制也太多了些。别让他读书了，别让老师们教导他了！你们负责这件事情。让他运动，保持心情愉快，用有益健康的办法使他过得开心，好让他恢复健康。”他又坐高了些，活力十足地继续说道：“他疯了，但他是我儿子，是英国王位的继承人。而且，无论疯还是正常，他都要继位！你们再听着，传令下去，不管谁泄露他的疯病，都是扰乱国家的和平与秩序，要处以绞刑！……给我拿杯水——我渴了，悲伤耗尽了我的气力……好了，拿走水杯……扶我一下。好了，这样可以了。疯了，他疯了？即便他疯一千倍，他仍然是威尔士王子，国王我确信。明天就用应有的古老仪式举行正式册立他为王子的典礼。马上准备吧，我的赫特福德伯爵。”","“List ye all!This my son is mad; but it is not permanent.Over-study hath done this, and somewhat too much of confinement.Away with his books and teachers!See ye to it.Pleasure him with sports; beguile him in wholesome ways, so that his health comes again.”He raised himself higher still, and went on with energy, “He is mad; but he is my son, and England’s heir; and, mad or sane, still shall he reign!And hear ye further, and proclaim it: whoso speaketh of this his distemper worketh against the peace and order of these realms, and shall to the gallows!...Give me to drink—I burn: this sorrow sappeth my strength....There, take away the cup....Support me.There, that is well.Mad, is he?Were he a thousand times mad, yet is he Prince of Wales and I the King will confirm it.This very morrow shall he be installed in his princely dignity in due and ancient form.Take instant order for it, my lord Hertford.”"
"一个贵族跪在王座旁，说道：","One of the nobles knelt at the royal couch, and said—"
"“国王陛下知道，英国掌管世代典礼的大司仪正被关押在伦敦塔里。这是不合适的，被关押的人——”","“The King’s majesty knoweth that the Hereditary Great Marshal of England lieth attainted in the Tower.It were not meet that one attainted—”"
"“住嘴！别拿那个可恶的人的名字玷污了我的耳朵。这个人要永远活着吗？让我无法按着自己的意愿行事？难道王子的册立典礼要推迟，就因为全国真的找不到一个没有背叛污点的典礼大臣来当司仪？不可能，万能的上帝！传令给国会，明天太阳升起之前就判诺福克死刑，否则，他们就要为此付出惨重的代价！”","“Peace!Insult not mine ears with his hated name.Is this man to live for ever?Am I to be baulked of my will?Is the prince to tarry uninstalled, because, forsooth, the realm lacketh an Earl Marshal free of treasonable taint to invest him with his honours?No, by the splendour of God!Warn my Parliament to bring me Norfolk’s doom before the sun rise again, else shall they answer for it grievously!”"
"赫特福德伯爵说道：","Lord Hertford said—"
"“国王的意愿就是法律。”于是，他起身回到了原来的位置。","“The King’s will is law;” and, rising, returned to his former place."
"老国王脸上的怒气渐渐消散，他说道：","Gradually the wrath faded out of the old King’s face, and he said—"
"“吻我，我的王子。好了……你害怕什么呀？我不是你慈爱的父王吗？”","“Kiss me, my prince.There... what fearest thou?Am I not thy loving father?”"
"“您对我很好，但这不值得。啊，万能的、仁慈的陛下，我真的知道。可是——可是——想到他要被处死，我就觉得悲伤，而且——”","“Thou art good to me that am unworthy, O mighty and gracious lord: that in truth I know.But—but—it grieveth me to think of him that is to die, and—”"
"“啊，这像你，这像你！我就知道，虽然你的头脑受了伤，你的心还是一样，因为你一直都有一副慈悲心肠。但是这个公爵阻挡了你接受你的荣誉，我会另找个人代替他，不要玷污册立的重任。安心吧，我的王子，别为这个事情让你可怜的脑袋烦恼了。”","“Ah, ’tis like thee, ’tis like thee!I know thy heart is still the same, even though thy mind hath suffered hurt, for thou wert ever of a gentle spirit.But this duke standeth between thee and thine honours: I will have another in his stead that shall bring no taint to his great office.Comfort thee, my prince: trouble not thy poor head with this matter.”"
"“可那不就是因为我，他才会更快地被处死了吗，我的陛下？只是因为我，他少活了多长时间啊？”","“But is it not I that speed him hence, my liege?How long might he not live, but for me?”"
"“不要想他了，我的王子，他不值得。再吻我一回，就去玩乐吧，因为我的病使我难受。我累了，我要歇息了。跟你的舅舅赫特福德和你的侍从们去吧，等我的身体缓过来了再来。”","“Take no thought of him, my prince: he is not worthy.Kiss me once again, and go to thy trifles and amusements; for my malady distresseth me.I am aweary, and would rest.Go with thine uncle Hertford and thy people, and come again when my body is refreshed.”"
"汤姆被带走了。他心情沉重，因为这最后一句话对他所抱的现在就被放走的希望来说是致命的打击。他又听到了嗡嗡的低低的惊呼声：“王子，王子来了！”","Tom, heavy-hearted, was conducted from the presence, for this last sentence was a death-blow to the hope he had cherished that now he would be set free.Once more he heard the buzz of low voices exclaiming, “The prince, the prince comes!”"
"他走过一列列闪闪发光的鞠着躬的大臣时，心情越来越沉重，因为他明白，他现在真的成了囚徒，也许要永远关在这个黄金铸造的囚笼里，做个孤独、没有朋友的王子，除非慈悲为怀的上帝可怜他，将他放走。","His spirits sank lower and lower as he moved between the glittering files of bowing courtiers; for he recognised that he was indeed a captive now, and might remain for ever shut up in this gilded cage, a forlorn and friendless prince, except God in his mercy take pity on him and set him free."
"而且，不管他走到哪儿，他好像都能看到诺福克大伯爵的断头和忘不掉的脸悬浮在空中，他那双眼睛责备地盯着汤姆。","And, turn where he would, he seemed to see floating in the air the severed head and the remembered face of the great Duke of Norfolk, the eyes fixed on him reproachfully."
"他以前做的梦都是非常愉快的，可现实却这么可怕！","His old dreams had been so pleasant; but this reality was so dreary!"
"第六章 汤姆接受指导","Chapter VI  Tom Receives Instructions"
"汤姆被引至一处宏伟套房的主房，被服侍着坐下。他很不情愿地坐了，因为周围站的是些年纪大的人和地位很高的人。他请求他们也坐下，但是他们只是鞠躬示谢或者低声道谢，却仍旧站着。他本来要坚持劝他们坐下，但是他的“舅舅”赫特福德伯爵在他耳边低声说：","Tom was conducted to the principal apartment of a noble suite, and made to sit down—a thing which he was loth to do, since there were elderly men and men of high degree about him.He begged them to be seated also, but they only bowed their thanks or murmured them, and remained standing.He would have insisted, but his ‘uncle’ the Earl of Hertford whispered in his ear—"
"“请不要劝了，我的殿下，他们在您面前坐下是不合适的。”有人通告说大臣圣约翰勋爵来了。他向汤姆敬礼，然后说道：","“Prithee, insist not, my lord; it is not meet that they sit in thy presence.”The Lord St. John was announced, and after making obeisance to Tom, he said—"
"“我奉了国王之命，有机密之事禀告殿下。除赫特福德伯爵可留下来，请高贵的殿下命随您来的所有人退下吧？”","“I come upon the King’s errand, concerning a matter which requireth privacy.Will it please your royal highness to dismiss all that attend you here, save my lord the Earl of Hertford?”"
"赫特福德发现汤姆不知道该怎么做，就在耳边悄悄告诉他摆手示意他们退下，还告诉他，除非觉得有必要，他不用说什么话。等侍从退下之后，圣约翰勋爵说：","Observing that Tom did not seem to know how to proceed, Hertford whispered him to make a sign with his hand, and not trouble himself to speak unless he chose.When the waiting gentlemen had retired, Lord St. John said—"
"“陛下的旨意，是考虑到国家正当的和重大的利益，王子殿下需尽其所能掩饰病情，直到病情消失，恢复到以前的样子。也就是说，他应不再跟任何人否认自己是真正的王子，伟大的英国的继承人；他要保持王子的尊贵，要接受正确而古老的传统所规定的礼仪和仪式，不能有语言和行为上的反抗；他不得再讲卑微的身世和生活，那是他的疾病引起的幻觉所导致的不益健康的想象；他要努力再记起那些他过去熟悉的面孔——而且即使他错了，也要保持平静，不要表现出惊讶的表情或其他行为，让人知道他忘了；在国事场合，如果有什么事情让他迷惑，他不知道应该做什么或说什么时，他不要对好奇的眼睛感到不安，只需按照赫特福德伯爵或是鄙人的建议去做。鄙人奉国王的旨意来侍候您，随叫随到，直到国王收回旨意。国王陛下这么说的，他问候尊贵的殿下，并祈求仁慈的上帝让您快快康复，现在以及永远都庇护您。”","“His majesty commandeth, that for due and weighty reasons of state, the prince’s grace shall hide his infirmity in all ways that be within his power, till it be passed and he be as he was before.To wit, that he shall deny to none that he is the true prince, and heir to England’s greatness; that he shall uphold his princely dignity, and shall receive, without word or sign of protest, that reverence and observance which unto it do appertain of right and ancient usage;that he shall cease to speak to any of that lowly birth and life his malady hath conjured out of the unwholesome imaginings of o’er-wrought fancy; that he shall strive with diligence to bring unto his memory again those faces which he was wont to know—and where he faileth he shall hold his peace, neither betraying by semblance of surprise or other sign that he hath forgot;that upon occasions of state, whensoever any matter shall perplex him as to the thing he should do or the utterance he should make, he shall show nought of unrest to the curious that look on, but take advice in that matter of the Lord Hertford, or my humble self, which are commanded of the King to be upon this service and close at call, till this commandment be dissolved.Thus saith the King’s majesty, who sendeth greeting to your royal highness, and prayeth that God will of His mercy quickly heal you and have you now and ever in His holy keeping.”"
"圣约翰勋爵敬了礼，站到一旁。汤姆只好温顺地回答道：","The Lord St. John made reverence and stood aside.Tom replied resignedly—"
"“国王已经下旨了。有什么不合意的，谁也不能以巧妙的托辞违抗国王的命令，或者随意更改。遵从国王的旨意。”","“The King hath said it.None may palter with the King’s command, or fit it to his ease, where it doth chafe, with deft evasions.The King shall be obeyed.”"
"赫特福德伯爵说道：","Lord Hertford said—"
"“说到国王陛下关于读书和此类严肃事务方面的命令，悠闲地做些轻快的娱乐活动也许能让殿下欢喜，以免您宴会上精神疲倦，因此而使健康受到损害。”","“Touching the King’s majesty’s ordainment concerning books and such like serious matters, it may peradventure please your highness to ease your time with lightsome entertainment, lest you go wearied to the banquet and suffer harm thereby.”"
"汤姆流露出惊疑的表情。当他看到圣约翰勋爵眼含悲伤地看着他时，他脸红了。他说道：","Tom’s face showed inquiring surprise; and a blush followed when he saw Lord St. John’s eyes bent sorrowfully upon him.His lordship said—"
"“您的记忆还有障碍，您刚刚表现出了惊讶——但是您不要为此不安，因为不会总这样，等病情好转就不会了。赫特福德伯爵提到了国王陛下允诺的城市宴会将在大概两个月之后举行，殿下应该参加。您现在想起来了吗？”","“Thy memory still wrongeth thee, and thou hast shown surprise—but suffer it not to trouble thee, for ’tis a matter that will not bide, but depart with thy mending malady.My Lord of Hertford speaketh of the city’s banquet which the King’s majesty did promise, some two months flown, your highness should attend.Thou recallest it now?”"
"“我很伤心地承认，我确实忘记了。”汤姆犹豫地说，脸又红了。","“It grieves me to confess it had indeed escaped me,” said Tom, in a hesitating voice; and blushed again."
"此时，有人通报伊丽莎白公主和简·格雷郡主来了。两位伯爵意味深长地交换了眼神，然后赫特福德快速走向门口。两位年轻的姑娘走过他身旁时，他低声地说：","At this moment the Lady Elizabeth and the Lady Jane Grey were announced.The two lords exchanged significant glances, and Hertford stepped quickly toward the door.As the young girls passed him, he said in a low voice—"
"“小姐们，请你们假装看不出他有什么不对劲的，他丧失记忆时，也别表现出惊讶——如果看到这疾病是如何渗透到每件小事时，你们会伤心的。”","“I pray ye, ladies, seem not to observe his humours, nor show surprise when his memory doth lapse—it will grieve you to note how it doth stick at every trifle.”"
"同时，圣约翰勋爵在对汤姆耳语：","Meantime Lord St. John was saying in Tom’s ear—"
"“殿下，请您将陛下的心意常记于心。记住您能记住的，假装记住您忘了的。不要让她们看出您与往常有很大变化，因为您知道您以前的玩伴心里对您是多么温柔，这该令她们多么伤心啊。殿下，您愿意我留下吗？——还有您的舅舅？”","“Please you, sir, keep diligently in mind his majesty’s desire.Remember all thou canst—seem to remember all else.Let them not perceive that thou art much changed from thy wont, for thou knowest how tenderly thy old play-fellows bear thee in their hearts and how ’twould grieve them.Art willing, sir, that I remain?—and thine uncle?”"
"汤姆打了手势，还低语一句，表示同意，因为他已经在学习。在他淳朴的心里，他立志自己要按照国王的旨意，尽力表现得最好。","Tom signified assent with a gesture and a murmured word, for he was already learning, and in his simple heart was resolved to acquit himself as best he might, according to the King’s command."
"尽管小心谨慎，但这几个年轻人的谈话仍时不时变得有些尴尬。说实话，汤姆不止一次地差点失控，几乎要供认他配不上这个伟大的角色，但伊丽莎白公主的机敏救了他，或者机警的大人们有意无意地插句话，也产生了同样令人高兴的效果。一回，简小郡主问了汤姆个问题，使他焦虑不安。","In spite of every precaution, the conversation among the young people became a little embarrassing at times.More than once, in truth, Tom was near to breaking down and confessing himself unequal to his tremendous part; but the tact of the Princess Elizabeth saved him, or a word from one or the other of the vigilant lords, thrown in apparently by chance, had the same happy effect.Once the little Lady Jane turned to Tom and dismayed him with this question,—"
"“您今天向王后请安了吗，殿下？”","“Hast paid thy duty to the Queen’s majesty to-day, my lord?”"
"汤姆犹豫了，脸色忧伤，危急之中正欲结巴地说些什么，圣约翰伯爵此时接了话。作为朝臣会常常遇到微妙的难题，要能够随时回答，于是他从容不迫地替王子回答道：","Tom hesitated, looked distressed, and was about to stammer out something at hazard, when Lord St. John took the word and answered for him with the easy grace of a courtier accustomed to encounter delicate difficulties and to be ready for them—"
"“他去过了，郡主。看到殿下的状况，她大大地鼓励他。不是这样吗，殿下？”","“He hath indeed, madam, and she did greatly hearten him, as touching his majesty’s condition; is it not so, your highness?”"
"汤姆喃喃地说了句什么表示同意，却觉着自己踏入了危险的境地。大概过了一会儿，有人提到目前汤姆不再学习，对此小郡主大声说道：","Tom mumbled something that stood for assent, but felt that he was getting upon dangerous ground.Somewhat later it was mentioned that Tom was to study no more at present, whereupon her little ladyship exclaimed—"
"“太可惜了，太可惜了！您原来一直很勇敢地向前冲。但是，耐心等待吧，很快就好了。您很快就能够荣幸地像您父王一样有学识，学会和他一样多的语言，我善良的王子。”","“’Tis a pity, ’tis a pity!Thou wert proceeding bravely.But bide thy time in patience: it will not be for long.Thou’lt yet be graced with learning like thy father, and make thy tongue master of as many languages as his, good my prince.”"
"“我父亲！”汤姆一时失去警觉，叫喊道，“我相信他连自己的语言都说不好，只有住在猪窝里的那些下等人能明白他的意思。至于说什么学识——”","“My father!” cried Tom, off his guard for the moment.“I trow he cannot speak his own so that any but the swine that kennel in the styes may tell his meaning; and as for learning of any sort soever—”"
"他抬头一看，遇上了圣约翰勋爵严肃的警告的眼神。","He looked up and encountered a solemn warning in my Lord St. John’s eyes."
"他停住，红了脸，然后悲伤地低声说：“啊，又是我的病害的，我的思想迷了路。我不是有意冒犯国王陛下的。”","He stopped, blushed, and then continued low and sadly: “Ah, my malady persecuteth me again, and my mind wandereth.I meant the King’s grace no irreverence.”"
"“我们知道，殿下，”伊丽莎白公主说道，一面很恭敬却也很亲切地将她“弟弟”的手放在自己手掌中间，“别这样烦自己。这不是您的错，不过是您的病的原因。”","“We know it, sir,” said the Princess Elizabeth, taking her ‘brother’s’ hand between her two palms, respectfully but caressingly; “trouble not thyself as to that.The fault is none of thine, but thy distemper’s.”"
"“您是个温柔的安慰者，亲爱的公主，”汤姆感激地说，“我大着胆子说，是我的心让我感谢您的。”","“Thou’rt a gentle comforter, sweet lady,” said Tom, gratefully, “and my heart moveth me to thank thee for’t, an’ I may be so bold.”"
"还有一回，冒失的简小郡主用个简单的希腊词语向汤姆开火。伊丽莎白公主非常敏锐地从那个靶子的沉默和茫然中看出这一枪过了火，所以她平静地用希腊语替汤姆回了一弹，然后马上转移了话题。","Once the giddy little Lady Jane fired a simple Greek phrase at Tom.The Princess Elizabeth’s quick eye saw by the serene blankness of the target’s front that the shaft was overshot; so she tranquilly delivered a return volley of sounding Greek on Tom’s behalf, and then straightway changed the talk to other matters."
"大体上，时间愉快又同样顺利地过去了。障碍和隔阂越来越少，而汤姆看到所有人都亲切而努力帮助他，不在意他的错误，也变得越来越泰然自若。当获知这两位小姐会陪他参加晚上市长的宴会，他如释重负，满心欢喜，因为他觉得，现在要面对那么多的陌生人，他身边不能没有朋友。可是，如果是在一小时前，想到她们要陪他一块儿去，对他来说真是一件不堪忍受的恐怖事件啊。","Time wore on pleasantly, and likewise smoothly, on the whole.Snags and sandbars grew less and less frequent, and Tom grew more and more at his ease, seeing that all were so lovingly bent upon helping him and overlooking his mistakes.When it came out that the little ladies were to accompany him to the Lord Mayor’s banquet in the evening, his heart gave a bound of relief and delight, for he felt that he should not be friendless, now, among that multitude of strangers; whereas, an hour earlier, the idea of their going with him would have been an insupportable terror to him."
"在这次会见中，汤姆的守护天使——那两位大臣并没有其他人那么愉快。他们更觉得自己像是在驾驶一艘大船穿过危险的海峡。他们一直保持着警惕，也明白自己的职责不可儿戏。因此，当公主们的拜访终于临近尾声，又有人通报说吉尔福德·达德利勋爵来见时，他们不仅觉得这次谈话耗尽了他们的精力，而且感觉自己状态不佳，无力再把船驶回来，把这危险的航行重新来过。因此他们很恭敬地建议汤姆推托，汤姆也很高兴地这么做了。但当简郡主听到这位出色的小伙子推掉会见时，脸上闪现了一丝失望。","Tom’s guardian angels, the two lords, had had less comfort in the interview than the other parties to it.They felt much as if they were piloting a great ship through a dangerous channel; they were on the alert constantly, and found their office no child’s play.Wherefore, at last, when the ladies’ visit was drawing to a close and the Lord Guilford Dudley was announced, they not only felt that their charge had been sufficiently taxed for the present, but also that they themselves were not in the best condition to take their ship back and make their anxious voyage all over again.So they respectfully advised Tom to excuse himself, which he was very glad to do, although a slight shade of disappointment might have been observed upon my Lady Jane’s face when she heard the splendid stripling denied admittance."
"此刻出现了一阵沉默，似乎是在等待着什么，而汤姆不明白这是什么意思。赫特福德伯爵给他示意，他看了一眼，但是仍然没明白什么意思。素有准备的伊丽莎白像往常一样从容地救了他。她行了礼，然后说道：","There was a pause now, a sort of waiting silence which Tom could not understand.He glanced at Lord Hertford, who gave him a sign—but he failed to understand that also.The ready Elizabeth came to the rescue with her usual easy grace.She made reverence and said—"
"“我们可以离开我的弟弟王子殿下了吗？”","“Have we leave of the prince’s grace my brother to go?”"
"汤姆说：","Tom said—"
"“其实，公主们需要我做什么，只要问一声就行。我还希望能在我的权利之内为她们做些别的什么，而不只是让她们陪着我，让我轻松愉悦呢。你们好好休息，上帝与你们同在！”他暗自一笑，想着：“在我读的书里，我只住在王子们中，看来这不是没有用的，我学会了些说话的小窍门，像他们一样精致而优雅地讲话。”","“Indeed your ladyships can have whatsoever of me they will, for the asking; yet would I rather give them any other thing that in my poor power lieth, than leave to take the light and blessing of their presence hence.Give ye good den, and God be with ye!”Then he smiled inwardly at the thought, “’Tis not for nought I have dwelt but among princes in my reading, and taught my tongue some slight trick of their broidered and gracious speech withal!”"
"出色的公主们走后，汤姆疲倦地转向他的看护人，说道：","When the illustrious maidens were gone, Tom turned wearily to his keepers and said—"
"“可否请伯爵允许我找个安静处休息？”","“May it please your lordships to grant me leave to go into some corner and rest me?”"
"赫特福德伯爵说道：","Lord Hertford said—"
"“回禀殿下，殿下您吩咐，我们就遵从。您确实需要休息了，因为您过会儿要到城里去。”他按下铃召来一个仆人，命他去把威廉·赫伯特爵士叫过来。这位绅士径直过来了，把汤姆引到一间内室。汤姆一进去就要拿杯水喝，但一个穿着丝绸和天鹅绒衣服的仆人抓住了杯子，单腿跪下，用一个黄金托盘托住杯子递给他。","“So please your highness, it is for you to command, it is for us to obey.That thou should’st rest is indeed a needful thing, since thou must journey to the city presently.”He touched a bell, and a page appeared, who was ordered to desire the presence of Sir William Herbert.This gentleman came straightway, and conducted Tom to an inner apartment.Tom’s first movement there was to reach for a cup of water; but a silk-and-velvet servitor seized it, dropped upon one knee, and offered it to him on a golden salver."
"接着，这位疲倦的囚徒坐下来，正要脱掉自己的短筒靴，眼睛怯怯地示意他们退下。但这时，另一个穿丝绸和天鹅绒衣服的讨厌鬼跪下来，帮他脱掉了。他又两三次试图自己来，但每次都很快被阻止了。他最终放弃了，顺从地叹了口气，喃喃自语道：“该死，他们也不让我喘口气，真奇怪！”他穿了拖鞋，裹上一件华丽的睡袍，终于躺下休息了。但是他睡不着，因为他脑袋里的思绪纷繁复杂，而且屋里满是人。他不能让前面那些人退下，所以他们留下来了；他不知道怎么让后面的人退下，所以他们也留下来了。他为此感到非常失望，而他们也是。","Next the tired captive sat down and was going to take off his buskins, timidly asking leave with his eye, but another silk-and-velvet discomforter went down upon his knees and took the office from him.He made two or three further efforts to help himself, but being promptly forestalled each time, he finally gave up, with a sigh of resignation and a murmured “Beshrew me, but I marvel they do not require to breathe for me also!”Slippered, and wrapped in a sumptuous robe, he laid himself down at last to rest, but not to sleep, for his head was too full of thoughts and the room too full of people.He could not dismiss the former, so they stayed; he did not know enough to dismiss the latter, so they stayed also, to his vast regret—and theirs."
"汤姆离开了，只留下了他那两个贵族守护者。他们沉思了一会儿，不停地摇头，在地板上踱来踱去，然后，圣约翰勋爵开口道：","Tom’s departure had left his two noble guardians alone.They mused a while, with much head-shaking and walking the floor, then Lord St. John said—"
"“老实说，您怎么想的？”","“Plainly, what dost thou think?”"
"“那么，老实说，这个。国王年事已高，而我的侄子疯了——他将疯着登上皇位，然后继续疯着。上帝保护英国，因为她将需要上帝的保护！”","“Plainly, then, this.The King is near his end; my nephew is mad—mad will mount the throne, and mad remain.God protect England, since she will need it!”"
"“真的是会这样的，确实。但是……你不奇怪……奇怪……”","“Verily it promiseth so, indeed.But ... have you no misgivings as to ... as to ...”"
"说话者犹豫着，最后停住了。显然，他觉得他遇到了棘手的问题。赫特福德伯爵停在他面前，用清澈、直率的目光看着他的脸，说道：","The speaker hesitated, and finally stopped.He evidently felt that he was upon delicate ground.Lord Hertford stopped before him, looked into his face with a clear, frank eye, and said—"
"“接着说——只有我能听到。奇怪什么？”","“Speak on—there is none to hear but me.Misgivings as to what?”"
"“我是很不愿意讲出我的想法的，而且您与他有血缘关系，伯爵。但是，如果我真有所冒犯，希望您原谅。精神失常让殿下的行为举止变化如此之大，不是很奇怪吗？虽然他的举止和言语还是像王子的样儿，但是在许多无足轻重的琐事上，却跟以前的习惯不一样。精神失常使他完全忘记他父王的容貌，忘记了历来做惯了的王室仪式和礼节，记得拉丁文，却忘了希腊文和法文，这不是很奇怪吗？伯爵，不要生气，请让我减少心中的忧虑，并接受我感激的道谢吧。我总在想，他说他不是王子，所以——”","“I am full loth to word the thing that is in my mind, and thou so near to him in blood, my lord.But craving pardon if I do offend, seemeth it not strange that madness could so change his port and manner?—not but that his port and speech are princely still, but that they differ, in one unweighty trifle or another, from what his custom was aforetime.Seemeth it not strange that madness should filch from his memory his father’s very lineaments; the customs and observances that are his due from such as be about him; and, leaving him his Latin, strip him of his Greek and French?My lord, be not offended, but ease my mind of its disquiet and receive my grateful thanks.It haunteth me, his saying he was not the prince, and so—”"
"“住嘴，先生，你说这话真是大不敬！你难道忘了国王的圣旨？别忘了，如果我听了，我就与你一样是在犯罪。”","“Peace, my lord, thou utterest treason!Hast forgot the King’s command?Remember I am party to thy crime if I but listen.”"
"圣约翰脸色苍白，连忙说道：","St. John paled, and hastened to say—"
"“我错了，我真的承认我错了。请您替我保守秘密，高抬贵手，我再也不会想或者讲这件事情了。您放过我吧，先生，不然我就毁了。”","“I was in fault, I do confess it.Betray me not, grant me this grace out of thy courtesy, and I will neither think nor speak of this thing more.Deal not hardly with me, sir, else am I ruined.”"
"“我还好，先生。您别再对我或其他人胡言乱语了，就当您刚才什么都没说。但是您不需要疑虑。他是我妹妹的儿子，我不是从他还在摇篮里时就熟悉他的声音、脸蛋、体形了吗？精神失常能导致所有您在他身上看到的这些奇怪矛盾的事情，而且还不止这些呢。您不记得啦，那位疯了的马利男爵是如何忘了他六十年来一直熟识的自己的那张喜爱的脸，还以为那是别人的。而且，他竟然声称自己是玛丽·玛格达莱妮的儿子，还说自己的脑袋是西班牙玻璃做的。因此，老实说，王子的病不容许受到任何影响，以免有些不注意的仆人不幸加重他的病情。不要忧虑了，我好心的先生。这就是王子——我很熟悉他——而且，他很快就会成为您的国王的。记着这一点对您有好处，多想想这个，不要再想那些。”","“I am content, my lord.So thou offend not again, here or in the ears of others, it shall be as though thou hadst not spoken.But thou need’st not have misgivings.He is my sister’s son; are not his voice, his face, his form, familiar to me from his cradle?Madness can do all the odd conflicting things thou seest in him, and more.Dost not recall how that the old Baron Marley, being mad, forgot the favour of his own countenance that he had known for sixty years, and held it was another’s; nay, even claimed he was the son of Mary Magdalene, and that his head was made of Spanish glass; and, sooth to say, he suffered none to touch it, lest by mischance some heedless hand might shiver it?Give thy misgivings easement, good my lord.This is the very prince—I know him well—and soon will be thy king; it may advantage thee to bear this in mind, and more dwell upon it than the other.”"
"二人又深入地谈了一阵子，圣约翰勋爵尽力掩饰他的错误，一个劲儿地说现在自己的信念坚定了，不会再有所怀疑。赫特福德伯爵让同是看护人的圣约翰勋爵走了，自己一个人坐下来守卫。他很快陷入了沉思，而且很显然，他越想越觉得烦恼。不久，他开始在地板上踱来踱去，喃喃自语。","After some further talk, in which the Lord St. John covered up his mistake as well as he could by repeated protests that his faith was thoroughly grounded now, and could not be assailed by doubts again, the Lord Hertford relieved his fellow-keeper, and sat down to keep watch and ward alone.He was soon deep in meditation, and evidently the longer he thought, the more he was bothered.By-and-by he began to pace the floor and mutter."
"“呸！他肯定是王子！全世界会存在这样血统和出身完全不同、却如此神奇地相似的两个人吗？而且即使有这样的事，而碰巧一个替换了另一个的位置，那就更称得上是奇迹了。不，这太荒唐了，荒唐，荒唐！”","“Tush, he MUST be the prince!Will any be in all the land maintains there can be two, not of one blood and birth, so marvellously twinned?And even were it so, ’twere yet a stranger miracle that chance should cast the one into the other’s place.Nay, ’tis folly, folly, folly!”"
"不一会儿，他说道：","Presently he said—"
"“如果他是冒充的，正常情况下应该自称为王子才是。你看看，这才是合理的。但是，有没有这么一个冒充者，当国王称他王子，朝廷大臣称他王子，所有人都称他王子，而他自己却否认自己是王子，还要求降低身份的呢？不！看在圣斯威森的灵魂的份儿上，不！这是真正的王子，他疯了！”","“Now were he impostor and called himself prince, look you that would be natural; that would be reasonable.But lived ever an impostor yet, who, being called prince by the king, prince by the court, prince by all, DENIED his dignity and pleaded against his exaltation?NO!By the soul of St. Swithin, no!This is the true prince, gone mad!”"
"第七章 汤姆的初次御餐","Chapter VII  Tom’s First Royal Dinner"
"大概下午一点钟之后，汤姆虽不自在，却顺从地让侍臣们给他穿好衣服，准备享用御餐。他看到自己如之前一样穿着华丽，只是这一次，从领口的飞边到长筒袜，每样东西都不同了，每样东西都换了。不一会儿，他被郑重地引至一处宽敞华丽的房间，里面已经摆好了一张单人用的桌子。房里的家具都是由厚重的黄金铸造而成的，精美的设计更是使之可谓价值连城，因为那些是本韦努托的作品。高贵的仆人们占了房间的一半。一位牧师祷告完毕，汤姆正要吃——长久以来，饥饿对他是常事——但这时，伯克利伯爵打断了他，在他脖子上系了一条餐巾。该贵族世世代代都是威尔士王子的餐巾官。汤姆的斟酒人在场，汤姆多次想自己倒酒都他被阻止了。威尔士王子殿下的品菜官也在场，冒着中毒的危险，随时奉命品尝任何可疑菜肴。这时，他只是装饰性的附属品，很少有机会发挥自己的作用。但若往回倒几辈人，当品菜官曾经非常危险，这并不是个令人向往的高位。有点奇怪，他们为什么不用狗或水管工？不过，皇家所有的事情都怪怪的。寓所第一男仆达西大人在场，天知道他在那儿做什么。但是他在那儿——这就够了。总管大人在场，他站在汤姆的椅子后面，遵照站在旁边的大膳务官和大厨官的命令，监督这庄重的用膳仪式。除了这些，汤姆还有三百八十四个仆人。不过当然，他们并不全在房里面，房里的人还不到总人数的四分之一，而汤姆也不知道他们的存在。","Somewhat after one in the afternoon, Tom resignedly underwent the ordeal of being dressed for dinner.He found himself as finely clothed as before, but everything different, everything changed, from his ruff to his stockings.He was presently conducted with much state to a spacious and ornate apartment, where a table was already set for one.Its furniture was all of massy gold, and beautified with designs which well-nigh made it priceless, since they were the work of Benvenuto.The room was half-filled with noble servitors.A chaplain said grace, and Tom was about to fall to, for hunger had long been constitutional with him, but was interrupted by my lord the Earl of Berkeley, who fastened a napkin about his neck; for the great post of Diaperers to the Prince of Wales was hereditary in this nobleman’s family.Tom’s cupbearer was present, and forestalled all his attempts to help himself to wine.The Taster to his highness the Prince of Wales was there also, prepared to taste any suspicious dish upon requirement, and run the risk of being poisoned.He was only an ornamental appendage at this time, and was seldom called upon to exercise his function; but there had been times, not many generations past, when the office of taster had its perils, and was not a grandeur to be desired.Why they did not use a dog or a plumber seems strange; but all the ways of royalty are strange.My Lord d’Arcy, First Groom of the Chamber, was there, to do goodness knows what; but there he was—let that suffice.The Lord Chief Butler was there, and stood behind Tom’s chair, overseeing the solemnities, under command of the Lord Great Steward and the Lord Head Cook, who stood near.Tom had three hundred and eighty-four servants beside these; but they were not all in that room, of course, nor the quarter of them; neither was Tom aware yet that they existed."
"那些在场的仆人这会儿已经被仔细训过话：要记住王子暂时有点神志不清，对他反常的行为要小心应付，不能表现出惊讶来。他们很快就见识了这些“反常的行为”，但这些行为勾起的只是他们的同情和悲伤，而不是欢笑。他们看到心爱的王子病成这样，非常苦恼。","All those that were present had been well drilled within the hour to remember that the prince was temporarily out of his head, and to be careful to show no surprise at his vagaries.These ‘vagaries’ were soon on exhibition before them; but they only moved their compassion and their sorrow, not their mirth.It was a heavy affliction to them to see the beloved prince so stricken."
"可怜的汤姆基本用手抓着吃，但是没人笑他，甚至好像谁都没注意到。他好奇地、饶有兴趣地审视着自己的餐巾，因为它织得非常讲究、漂亮，然后，他天真地说：","Poor Tom ate with his fingers mainly; but no one smiled at it, or even seemed to observe it.He inspected his napkin curiously, and with deep interest, for it was of a very dainty and beautiful fabric, then said with simplicity—"
"“请把它收起来，以免我不小心把它弄脏了。”","“Prithee, take it away, lest in mine unheedfulness it be soiled.”"
"世袭的餐巾官恭恭敬敬地将它收起来，没说一句话，没有任何反抗。","The Hereditary Diaperer took it away with reverent manner, and without word or protest of any sort."
"汤姆饶有兴趣地瞧着芜菁和莴苣，问这些是什么，能不能吃，因为英国人最近才开始种这些菜，以前这些菜都是从荷兰进口的奢侈品。仆人们毕恭毕敬地回答了他的问题，没显出任何惊讶来。他吃完了甜品，又在口袋里装满了坚果，但似乎没人注意到，也没人因此不自在。但下一刻，他自己觉着不好意思了，露出不安的神色，因为这是整顿御膳中他能自己动手做的唯一一件事，他相信自己做了一件最不合适、最不像王子的事情。这时，他鼻子上的肌肉开始抽搐，鼻尖直向上皱起。鼻子还在抽搐，汤姆显得越来越痛苦。他哀求地看着周围一个又一个的大臣，眼中泛起了泪花。他们快步走上前来，脸上神情忧伤，问他怎么了。汤姆表情非常痛苦地说：","Tom examined the turnips and the lettuce with interest, and asked what they were, and if they were to be eaten; for it was only recently that men had begun to raise these things in England in place of importing them as luxuries from Holland.His question was answered with grave respect, and no surprise manifested.When he had finished his dessert, he filled his pockets with nuts; but nobody appeared to be aware of it, or disturbed by it.But the next moment he was himself disturbed by it, and showed discomposure; for this was the only service he had been permitted to do with his own hands during the meal, and he did not doubt that he had done a most improper and unprincely thing.At that moment the muscles of his nose began to twitch, and the end of that organ to lift and wrinkle.This continued, and Tom began to evince a growing distress.He looked appealingly, first at one and then another of the lords about him, and tears came into his eyes.They sprang forward with dismay in their faces, and begged to know his trouble.Tom said with genuine anguish—"
"“我请求你们的宽容：我的鼻子痒得厉害。这种危急情况下，有什么习俗和惯例呢？请快点，因为我马上就忍不住了。”","“I crave your indulgence: my nose itcheth cruelly.What is the custom and usage in this emergence?Prithee, speed, for ’tis but a little time that I can bear it.”"
"没有人笑，所有人都痛苦得不知所措，忧虑地面面相觑，希望有人能拿个主意。可是瞧啊，这次是走到死胡同了，英国历史上没说怎么处理这种事。礼节大师不在，没人敢冒险驶进这片未知海域，或者冒然解决这个严重的问题。哎呀！没有世袭的抓痒官。与此同时，汤姆的眼泪夺眶而出，开始顺着脸颊流下来了。他抽搐的鼻子比刚才更需要抓挠了。最终，天性打破了礼节的束缚。汤姆在心中祈祷，如果他做错了，请求得到原谅。然后，他自己挠了鼻子，让心情沉重的仆人们都松了一口气。","None smiled; but all were sore perplexed, and looked one to the other in deep tribulation for counsel.But behold, here was a dead wall, and nothing in English history to tell how to get over it.The Master of Ceremonies was not present: there was no one who felt safe to venture upon this uncharted sea, or risk the attempt to solve this solemn problem.Alas! There was no Hereditary Scratcher.Meantime the tears had overflowed their banks, and begun to trickle down Tom’s cheeks.His twitching nose was pleading more urgently than ever for relief.At last nature broke down the barriers of etiquette: Tom lifted up an inward prayer for pardon if he was doing wrong, and brought relief to the burdened hearts of his court by scratching his nose himself."
"他用毕御膳，一位大臣来了，将一只又大又浅的黄金盘子拿到他面前，盆子里盛着芳香的玫瑰水，用来清洗嘴巴和手指。世袭的餐巾官站在一旁，拿着餐巾备用。汤姆疑惑地凝视了一会儿这个盆子，然后端到唇边，喝了一大口。然后，他把它还给了侍臣，说道：","His meal being ended, a lord came and held before him a broad, shallow, golden dish with fragrant rosewater in it, to cleanse his mouth and fingers with; and my lord the Hereditary Diaperer stood by with a napkin for his use.Tom gazed at the dish a puzzled moment or two, then raised it to his lips, and gravely took a draught.Then he returned it to the waiting lord, and said—"
"“不要，我不喜欢喝这个，大人。它闻着是挺香的，但是一点儿味道都没有。”","“Nay, it likes me not, my lord: it hath a pretty flavour, but it wanteth strength.”"
"看到疯了的王子这种新的古怪行为，周围所有人都心疼了，但没人被这令人心酸的场景逗笑。","This new eccentricity of the prince’s ruined mind made all the hearts about him ache; but the sad sight moved none to merriment."
"接着，汤姆又无意犯了个大错。他站起来就要离开饭桌，而这时，牧师正站在他椅子后面，举起双手，闭上眼抬起头，欲祈求上帝赐福。似乎仍旧没人注意到王子做了一件反常的事情。","Tom’s next unconscious blunder was to get up and leave the table just when the chaplain had taken his stand behind his chair, and with uplifted hands, and closed, uplifted eyes, was in the act of beginning the blessing.Still nobody seemed to perceive that the prince had done a thing unusual."
"应汤姆自己的请求，我们的小朋友现在被引至他的私人内阁，独自一人在那里自行其是。橡木的壁板上面有几个钩子，钩子上挂着几件亮闪闪的钢盔甲胄，盔甲上用金子镶满了设计精美的图案。这套威武的钢盔甲胄属于真正的王子，是帕尔皇后刚送给他的礼物。汤姆将护胫甲和臂铠穿上，戴上羽毛钢盔，穿上其他不用别人帮助就能自己穿上的部分。有一会儿，他想叫人来帮他穿上剩下的部分，可他想起从御膳上带回来的坚果。他想，如果没有一群人盯着他，没有大世袭官们拿他不喜欢的礼节来烦他，这样吃坚果才痛快。于是，他把那些漂亮的东西放回原处，径自嗑起了坚果。自从上帝错误地使他成为王子后，这是他第一次感到近乎真正的快乐。吃完了坚果，他偶然发现书橱里有些吸引人的书，其中一本是关于英国宫廷礼节的。这真是一件奖品。他躺在一把奢华的长沙发椅上，十分热切地自学起来。我们暂且让他在那儿看吧。","By his own request our small friend was now conducted to his private cabinet, and left there alone to his own devices.Hanging upon hooks in the oaken wainscoting were the several pieces of a suit of shining steel armour, covered all over with beautiful designs exquisitely inlaid in gold.This martial panoply belonged to the true prince—a recent present from Madam Parr the Queen.Tom put on the greaves, the gauntlets, the plumed helmet, and such other pieces as he could do　without assistance, and for a while was minded to call for help and complete the matter, but bethought him of the nuts he had brought away from dinner, and the joy it would be to eat them with no crowd to eye him, and no Grand Hereditaries to pester him with undesired services; so he restored the pretty things to their several places, and soon was cracking nuts, and feeling almost naturally happy for the first time since God for his sins had made him a prince.When the nuts were all gone, he stumbled upon some inviting books in a closet, among them one about the etiquette of the English court.This was a prize.He lay down upon a sumptuous divan, and proceeded to instruct himself with honest zeal.Let us leave him there for the present."
"第八章 御玺出事了","Chapter VIII  The Question of the Seal"
"大约五点钟，亨利八世从小睡中醒来，仍没解乏，自己咕哝着：“烦人的梦，烦人的梦！我的死亡即将到来，已经有了预兆，我越来越弱的脉搏证实了这一点。”不一会儿，他眼睛里闪过一道凶恶的光，他咕哝道：“但在他死之前，我是不会死的。”","About five o’clock Henry VIII. awoke out of an unrefreshing nap, and muttered to himself, “Troublous dreams, troublous dreams!Mine end is now at hand: so say these warnings, and my failing pulses do confirm it.”Presently a wicked light flamed up in his eye, and he muttered, “Yet will not I die till HE go before.”"
"他的侍从们看到他醒了，有一个问他要不要让在屋外等候的大法官进来。","His attendants perceiving that he was awake, one of them asked his pleasure concerning the Lord Chancellor, who was waiting without."
"“宣进来，宣进来！”国王急切地大声喊道。","“Admit him, admit him!” exclaimed the King eagerly."
"大法官进来了，在国王长榻旁跪下，说道：","The Lord Chancellor entered, and knelt by the King’s couch, saying—"
"“我已经按照国王的旨意，下令王国的贵族穿上长袍，他们现在站在议院的栅栏前，已经在那儿宣判了诺福克公爵的死刑，并谦卑地等陛下再下旨。”","“I have given order, and, according to the King’s command, the peers of the realm, in their robes, do now stand at the bar of the House, where, having confirmed the Duke of Norfolk’s doom, they humbly wait his majesty’s further pleasure in the matter.”"
"国王一阵狂喜，容光焕发。他说道：","The King’s face lit up with a fierce joy.Said he—"
"“扶我起来！我要亲自到我的国会前，亲手在决议文上盖印，这样就清除了我的——”","“Lift me up!In mine own person will I go before my Parliament, and with mine own hand will I seal the warrant that rids me of—”"
"他的声音低了下去，脸色突然变得苍白，没了刚才的红晕。侍从服侍他躺在枕头上，赶紧帮助他恢复元气。不一会儿，他悲伤地说道：","His voice failed; an ashen pallor swept the flush from his cheeks; and the attendants eased him back upon his pillows, and hurriedly assisted him with restoratives.Presently he said sorrowfully—"
"“哎呀，我是多么盼望这个美好的时刻啊！瞧，这一刻来得太晚了，我没办法去做这件我渴望的事。不过你们快去，你们快去！既然我不能去，就让别人做这件高兴的事情吧。我把我的御玺委托给你们，由你们这些大臣来办这件事。你们快去吧！太阳再次东升西落之前，把他的人头带来，也许我能看到。”“遵照国王的旨意，这就去办。能否请陛下现在下令将御玺交给我，我好去办这件事？”","“Alack, how have I longed for this sweet hour! and lo, too late it cometh, and I am robbed of this so coveted chance.But speed ye, speed ye!Let others do this happy office sith ’tis denied to me.I put my Great Seal in commission: choose thou the lords that shall compose it, and get ye to your work.Speed ye, man!Before the sun shall rise and set again, bring me his head that I may see it.”“According to the King’s command, so shall it be.Will’t please your majesty to order that the Seal be now restored to me, so that I may forth upon the business?”"
"“御玺？御玺不是放在你那儿吗？”","“The Seal?Who keepeth the Seal but thou?”"
"“尊敬的陛下，两天前，您确实从我这儿拿走了，说要等到您亲手用它在诺福克公爵的决议书上印章，而在此之前暂时不会用。”","“Please your majesty, you did take it from me two days since, saying it should no more do its office till your own royal hand should use it upon the Duke of Norfolk’s warrant.”"
"“哎呀，那么我真的拿过来了，我确实记起来了……我拿它做什么了？我现在很虚弱……这些天，我的记性糟透了……奇怪，奇怪——”","“Why, so in sooth I did: I do remember....What did I with it? ...I am very feeble....So oft these days doth my memory play the traitor with me....’Tis strange, strange—”"
"国王开始口齿不清地哼哼，有时微弱地摇摇灰白的头，暗自努力回忆他把御玺放在了什么地方。最后，赫特福德勋爵壮着胆子跪下来，说了点线索：","The King dropped into inarticulate mumblings, shaking his grey head weakly from time to time, and gropingly trying to recollect what he had done with the Seal.At last my Lord Hertford ventured to kneel and offer information—"
"“陛下，恕我斗胆，这里有几位和我都记得，那天您把御玺放在威尔士王子殿下的手里，让他保管——”","“Sire, if that I may be so bold, here be several that do remember with me how that you gave the Great Seal into the hands of his highness the Prince of Wales to keep against the day that—”"
"“对，真的是！”国王打断他，说道，“去拿吧！去，没时间了！”","“True, most true!”interrupted the king.“Fetch it!Go: time flieth!”"
"赫特福德勋爵飞奔到汤姆那里，但他很快又忧心忡忡、两手空空地回到了国王这儿。他沉痛地说：","Lord Hertford flew to Tom, but returned to the King before very long, troubled and empty-handed.He delivered himself to this effect—"
"“国王陛下，我感到非常悲伤，给您带来如此沉重而令人难过的消息，可这是上帝的意思，王子的病仍没好转，他不记得接过御玺。所以，我赶紧来报告，因为我觉得殿下有一大排的房间和大厅，在那里搜寻也只是浪费宝贵的时间，而且没什么用——”","“It grieveth me, my lord the King, to bear so heavy and unwelcome tidings; but it is the will of God that the prince’s affliction abideth still, and he cannot recall to mind that he received the Seal.So came I quickly to report, thinking it were waste of precious time, and little worth withal, that any should attempt to search the long array of chambers and saloons that belong unto his royal high—”"
"此刻，国王一声呻吟，打断了勋爵。过了一会儿，国王语调悲伤地说：","A groan from the King interrupted the lord at this point.After a little while his majesty said, with a deep sadness in his tone—"
"“别再烦他了，可怜的孩子。上帝对他下那么重的手，我心里很怜爱他，我伤心自己这病入膏肓的人不能替他分担什么，那就别去烦他了。”","“Trouble him no more, poor child.The hand of God lieth heavy upon him, and my heart goeth out in loving compassion for him, and sorrow that I may not bear his burden on mine old trouble-weighted shoulders, and so brings him peace.”"
"他闭上双眼喃喃自语，不一会儿就不出声了。过了一会儿，他又睁开了双眼，神情茫然地环视四周，最后，目光落在了跪着的大法官身上。他的脸立刻涨得通红，怒斥道：","He closed his eyes, fell to mumbling, and presently was silent.After a time he opened his eyes again, and gazed vacantly around until his glance rested upon the kneeling Lord Chancellor.Instantly his face flushed with wrath—"
"“什么，你还在这儿！以上帝的荣耀，你还没去办那个叛徒的事情，那么明天你的官帽就要休假了，因为戴它的脑袋没了！”","“What, thou here yet!By the glory of God, an’ thou gettest not about that traitor’s business, thy mitre shall have holiday the morrow for lack of a head to grace withal!”"
"大法官颤抖着回答道：","The trembling Chancellor answered—"
"“仁慈的陛下，我祈求您的宽恕！我只是在等着拿御玺。”","“Good your Majesty, I cry you mercy!I but waited for the Seal.”"
"“混蛋，你傻了吗？我以前常常带着出国的那个小御玺放在国库里。既然大御玺不见了，用小的不就行了？你是傻了吗？快滚！你听着，不把他人头带回来，就别来见我。”","“Man, hast lost thy wits?The small Seal which aforetime I was wont to take with me abroad lieth in my treasury.And, since the Great Seal hath flown away, shall not it suffice?Hast lost thy wits?Begone!And hark ye—come no more till thou do bring his head.”"
"可怜的大法官赶快逃离了这危险的地方。很快，卑屈的国会得到了授权，指定次日就将不幸的英国第一贵族——诺福克公爵斩首。","The poor Chancellor was not long in removing himself from this dangerous vicinity; nor did the commission waste time in giving the royal assent to the work of the slavish Parliament, and appointing the morrow for the beheading of the premier peer of England, the luckless Duke of Norfolk."
"第九章 河畔盛会","Chapter IX  The River Pageant"
"晚上九点钟，整片宽阔的皇宫河畔灯火通明。河上有许多船夫的船和游艇，密密麻麻的，一直延伸到目所能及的市区。它们都挂着彩灯，随水波轻轻地摇动着。河面俨然成了一座生机勃勃、无边无际的花园，花儿随着夏日的风轻轻摆动。宏伟的石头台阶通向水面，宽敞得足以容下一个德国公国的军队。这里也是一番值得一看的景象，有一列列身穿发亮盔甲的戟兵，还有一队队穿着华丽的侍从忙上忙下，前后奔走地筹备着。","At nine in the evening the whole vast river-front of the palace was blazing with light.The river itself, as far as the eye could reach city wards, was so thickly covered with watermen’s boats and with pleasure-barges, all fringed with coloured lanterns, and gently agitated by the waves, that it resembled a glowing and limitless garden of flowers stirred to soft motion by summer winds.The grand terrace of stone steps leading down to the water, spacious enough to mass the army of a German principality upon, was a picture to see, with its ranks of royal halberdiers in polished armour, and its troops of brilliantly costumed servitors flitting up and down, and to and fro, in the hurry of preparation."
"不一会儿，传来了一道命令，台阶上的所有人立刻消失了。此刻，空气凝重，肃静中充满悬念和期待。在目所能及的范围内，您可以看到船上的众人都站了起来，抬手挡住灯笼和火炬晃眼的光，朝宫殿的方向望去。","Presently a command was given, and immediately all living creatures vanished from the steps.Now the air was heavy with the hush of suspense and expectancy.As far as one’s vision could carry, he might see the myriads of people in the boats rise up, and shade their eyes from the glare of lanterns and torches, and gaze toward the palace."
"大约四五十只国家游艇停在了台阶旁边。它们都涂得金碧辉煌，高耸的船首和船尾都雕刻着精致的图案。其中一些装饰着小旗子和彩带，一些装饰着金线织物和绣着盾形纹章的挂毯，还有的装饰着丝制的旗子，那旗子上系着无数小银铃，微风一吹，银铃就奏起一阵细雨般的欢快的音乐。还有的装饰得更加夸张，因为那是在王子跟前做事的贵族的游艇，游艇的边上围着别致的的盾牌，上面有华丽的纹章图案。每艘国家游艇都由一个船官牵引。除了划船者，这些船官每人都领了许多戴着闪亮的头盔和胸甲的士兵和一群音乐家。","A file of forty or fifty state barges drew up to the steps.They were richly gilt, and their lofty prows and sterns were elaborately carved.Some of them were decorated with banners and streamers; some with cloth-of-gold and arras embroidered with coats-of-arms; others with silken flags that had numberless little silver bells fastened to them, which shook out tiny showers of joyous music whenever the breezes fluttered them; others of yet higher pretensions, since they belonged to nobles in the prince’s immediate service, had their sides picturesquely fenced with shields gorgeously emblazoned with armorial bearings.Each state barge was towed by a tender.Besides the rowers, these tenders carried each a number of men-at-arms in glossy helmet and breastplate, and a company of musicians."
"此时，马上要开始的游行的前卫队出现在大门口，那是一队持戟的士兵。“他们穿着黑色与黄褐色条纹相间的高筒袜，戴着边上饰有银色玫瑰的天鹅绒帽子，穿着黑紫色和蓝色布料的紧身衣，前后都用金线绣了三支羽毛，那是王子的纹章。他们的戟柄套着深红色的天鹅绒，那是用镀金钉子钉上去的，还有金色的流苏装饰。他们左右排成两列长队，一直从宫殿大门延伸至水边。王子的那些穿金色和深红色制服的侍从将一条厚厚的、闪光的布或地毯铺在了两列队伍中间。之后，从里面传出了高昂的小号声。水上的乐师们奏起了欢快的序曲，两个拿着白色指挥棒的引领官从大门慢慢地、庄严地走出来了。他们身后跟着一名拿着市民权杖的官员，再后面是一个拿着市剑的官员；紧接着是几个城市卫队的警官，个个全副武装，袖子上佩戴着徽章；接着是一身传令官制服的嘉德纹章院长；再接着是几位巴斯骑士，每人袖子上都饰有白色蕾丝；接着是绅士；接着是穿猩红色长袍、戴猩红色压发帽的法官；接着是英国上议院院长，他穿着猩红色长袍，前襟敞开着，两边饰有白鼬皮；然后是披着猩红色斗篷的市议员代表团；最后是穿着国服的不同市民群体的代表。现在来了十二位法国绅士，他们衣着华丽，穿着镶着金色条纹的白色锦缎紧身棉袄，间有紫色塔夫绸的深红色天鹅绒短款斗篷，脚蹬康乃馨色的高筒靴，从台阶上走下来。这些是法国大使的随从。他们后面的十二个骑手是西班牙大使的随从，他们身着黑色天鹅绒，装饰丝毫不违礼仪。紧随其后的是几位英国大贵族和他们的侍从。","The advance-guard of the expected procession now appeared in the great gateway, a troop of halberdiers.‘They were dressed in striped hose of black and tawny, velvet caps graced at the sides with silver roses, and doublets of murrey and blue cloth, embroidered on the front and back with the three feathers, the prince’s blazon, woven in gold.Their halberd staves were covered with crimson velvet, fastened with gilt nails, and ornamented with gold tassels.Filing off on the right and left, they formed two long lines, extending from the gateway of the palace to the water’s edge.A thick rayed cloth or carpet was then unfolded, and laid down between them by attendants in the gold-and-crimson liveries of the prince.This done, a flourish of trumpets resounded from within.A lively prelude arose from the musicians on the water; and two ushers with white wands marched with a slow and stately pace from the portal.They were followed by an officer bearing the civic mace, after whom came another carrying the city’s sword; then several sergeants of the city guard, in their full accoutrements, and with badges on their sleeves; then the Garter King-at-arms, in his tabard; then several Knights of the Bath, each with a white lace on his sleeve; then their esquires; then the judges, in their robes of scarlet and coifs; then the Lord High Chancellor of England, in a robe of scarlet, open before, and purfled with minever; then a deputation of aldermen, in their scarlet cloaks; and then the heads of the different civic companies, in their robes of state.Now came twelve French gentlemen, in splendid habiliments, consisting of pourpoints of white damask barred with gold, short mantles of crimson velvet lined with violet taffeta, and carnation coloured hauts-de-chausses, and took their way down the steps.They were of the suite of the French ambassador, and were followed by twelve cavaliers of the suite of the Spanish ambassador, clothed in black velvet, unrelieved by any ornament.Following these came several great English nobles with their attendants."
"从里面传来小号齐鸣，王子的舅舅，也就是未来的萨默塞特大公爵出现在大门口。他身着金线织的黑色紧身衣，披着深红缎子斗篷，斗篷上有金线绣的花朵，系着镂空的银色丝带。他转过身，脱下插着羽毛的帽子，低低地、恭敬地弯下腰，然后又往后退，退一步一鞠躬。随后，小号声响了好一阵子，然后有人宣告：“给至高无上的威尔士王子爱德华让路！”随着一声雷鸣般的巨响，一条长长的火焰的红舌直冲到宫墙的上空。河上聚集的人群忽然大声呼喊表示欢迎，引起欢呼的人和这一切的主角正是汤姆·坎蒂。他走入了人们的视野，轻轻地点了点高贵的头。","There was a flourish of trumpets within; and the Prince’s uncle, the future great Duke of Somerset, emerged from the gateway, arrayed in a ‘doublet of black cloth-of-gold, and a cloak of crimson satin flowered with gold, and ribanded with nets of silver.’He turned, doffed his plumed cap, bent his body in a low reverence, and began to step backward, bowing at each step.A prolonged trumpet-blast followed, and a proclamation, “Way for the high and mighty the Lord Edward, Prince of Wales!”High aloft on the palace walls a long line of red tongues of flame leapt forth with a thunder-crash; the massed world on the river burst into a mighty roar of welcome; and Tom Canty, the cause and hero of it all, stepped into view and slightly bowed his princely head."
"他衣着华丽，身穿白色绸缎的紧身衣，紫色薄绸前衣，上面点缀了钻石，镶了貂皮边。他外面披了一件金线织的白色斗篷，斗篷上有三支羽毛的顶饰，间有蓝缎纹，镶着珠宝和宝石，用一枚闪光的扣子系在了身上。他脖子上戴着嘉德勋章，还有几枚王子的国外勋章。他身上凡是有光照到的地方，珠宝就会闪闪反光，令人目眩。啊，生在陋室、长在伦敦贫民窟的汤姆·坎蒂熟悉的是破衣烂衫、肮脏和痛苦，而眼前是怎样壮观的场景啊！","He was ‘magnificently habited in a doublet of white satin, with a front-piece of purple cloth-of-tissue, powdered with diamonds, and edged with ermine.Over this he wore a mantle of white cloth-of-gold, pounced with the triple-feathered crest, lined with blue satin, set with pearls and precious stones, and fastened with a clasp of brilliants.About his neck hung the order of the Garter, and several princely foreign orders;’ and wherever light fell upon him jewels responded with a blinding flash.O Tom Canty, born in a hovel, bred in the gutters of London, familiar with rags and dirt and misery, what a spectacle is this!"
"第十章 落难的王子","Chapter X  The Prince in the Toils"
"我们之前说到，约翰·坎蒂将真正的王子拽到了垃圾大院，紧跟着他的是一群喧闹、快活的暴徒。只有一个人为这个俘虏说了句好话，可没人理会。他的话几乎都没人听见，因为当时极为混乱。王子仍然挣扎着想脱身，对自己遭受的待遇大发脾气，直到约翰·坎蒂失去了他仅剩的一点耐心，突然勃然大怒，抡起橡木棍朝王子的头上打去。","We left John Canty dragging the rightful prince into Offal Court, with a noisy and delighted mob at his heels.There was but one person in it who offered a pleading word for the captive, and he was not heeded; he was hardly even heard, so great was the turmoil.The Prince continued to struggle for freedom, and to rage against the treatment he was suffering, until John Canty lost what little patience was left in him, and raised his oaken cudgel in a sudden fury over the Prince’s head."
"小伙子唯一的求情者冲上前来拦住了他的胳膊，于是，这一棍就落在了他自己的手腕上。坎蒂咆哮道：","The single pleader for the lad sprang to stop the man’s arm, and the blow descended upon his own wrist.Canty roared out—"
"“你多管闲事，是吧？那就赏给你。”","“Thou’lt meddle, wilt thou?Then have thy reward.”"
"他的棍子朝管闲事的人头上打下去，只听见一声呻吟，一个模糊的人影倒在了地上，倒在人群的脚中间。过了会儿，黑暗中便只剩那个人孤独地躺在那儿。暴徒依旧快活地前行，丝毫没有被这个插曲影响。","His cudgel crashed down upon the meddler’s head: there was a groan, a dim form sank to the ground among the feet of the crowd, and the next moment it lay there in the dark alone.The mob pressed on, their enjoyment nothing disturbed by this episode."
"不一会儿，王子发现自己到了约翰·坎蒂的住所，外人被关在了门外边。借着塞在瓶子里的牛脂蜡那微弱的光，他辨认出这个恶心的窝的大体模样，还有住在里面的人。两个脏兮兮的女孩和一位中年妇女蜷缩在屋子的一角，她们的神态就像习惯了虐待的动物，此刻正等待着、恐惧着。另一个角落里窝着一个枯槁憔悴的丑老太婆，一缕缕头发灰白，眼神恶毒。约翰·坎蒂对她说：","Presently the Prince found himself in John Canty’s abode, with the door closed against the outsiders.By the vague light of a tallow candle which was thrust into a bottle, he made out the main features of the loathsome den, and also the occupants of it.Two frowsy girls and a middle-aged woman cowered against the wall in one corner, with the aspect of animals habituated to harsh usage, and expecting and dreading it now.From another corner stole a withered hag with streaming grey hair and malignant eyes.John Canty said to this one—"
"“稍等！这里有出好看的表演。等你看腻了再让他停，那时随便你怎么重重地打他。站过来，小伙子。趁着还没忘记，现在再说说你那些愚蠢的话。说你的名字。你是谁？”","“Tarry!There’s fine mummeries here.Mar them not till thou’st enjoyed them: then let thy hand be heavy as thou wilt.Stand forth, lad.Now say thy foolery again, an thou’st not forgot it.Name thy name.Who art thou?”"
"被侮辱的血液又一次窜到小王子的脸颊，然后，他坚定而愤怒地瞪着这个人的脸，说道：","The insulted blood mounted to the little prince’s cheek once more, and he lifted a steady and indignant gaze to the man’s face and said—"
"“像你这样没教养的人，才会命令我开口。我现在告诉你，像我刚才告诉你的一样，我叫爱德华，威尔士王子，不是别人。”","“’Tis but ill-breeding in such as thou to command me to speak.I tell thee now, as I told thee before, I am Edward, Prince of Wales, and none other.”"
"这个令人震惊的回答使那老太婆定在了她站立的地板上，几乎一口气没喘上来。她盯着王子，惊呆了，这可逗乐了她的恶棍儿子，让他突然大笑起来。但是，汤姆·坎蒂的母亲和姐姐们的反应却不一样。她们原先害怕他挨打，现在害怕变成了某种异样的忧伤。她们带着悲哀而沮丧的表情跑上前去，大声说道：","The stunning surprise of this reply nailed the hag’s feet to the floor where she stood, and almost took her breath.She stared at the Prince in stupid amazement, which so amused her ruffianly son, that he burst into a roar of laughter.But the effect upon Tom Canty’s mother and sisters was different.Their dread of bodily injury gave way at once to distress of a different sort.They ran forward with woe and dismay in their faces, exclaiming—"
"“啊，可怜的汤姆，可怜的孩子！”","“Oh, poor Tom, poor lad!”"
"母亲跪在王子前面，双手放在他的肩膀上，怜悯地端详着他的脸，已是泪眼婆娑。她说：","The mother fell on her knees before the Prince, put her hands upon his shoulders, and gazed yearningly into his face through her rising tears.Then she said—"
"“啊，我可怜的孩子！你读的那些愚蠢的书终于害了你，夺走了你的理智。啊！我苦心劝你别读那些书，你为什么就是不听话？你伤透了你母亲的心。”","“Oh, my poor boy!Thy foolish reading hath wrought its woeful work at last, and ta’en thy wit away.Ah!Why did’st thou cleave to it when I so warned thee ’gainst it?Thou’st broke thy mother’s heart.”"
"王子看着她的脸，温柔地说道：","The Prince looked into her face, and said gently—"
"“你的儿子很好，他没有疯，善良的夫人。你放心，让我去王宫，他就在那里，我的父王立刻就会把他还给你。”","“Thy son is well, and hath not lost his wits, good dame.Comfort thee: let me to the palace where he is, and straightway will the King my father restore him to thee.”"
"“你的父王！啊，我的孩子！别说这些话，这是要杀头的，而且你身边的所有人都要遭殃。快从噩梦里醒过来吧。唤回你那可怜的、迷失的记忆。看着我。我不是生你、爱你的母亲吗？”","“The King thy father!Oh, my child!Unsay these words that be freighted with death for thee, and ruin for all that be near to thee.Shake of this gruesome dream.Call back thy poor wandering memory.Look upon me.Am not I thy mother that bore thee, and loveth thee?”"
"王子摇了摇头，不情愿地说道：“上帝知道我不愿意伤你的心，但我真的从没见过你的脸。”","The Prince shook his head and reluctantly said—“God knoweth I am loth to grieve thy heart; but truly have I never looked upon thy face before.”"
"这妇人往后一沉，坐在了地板上，然后双手捂住眼睛，心碎地抽泣、痛哭起来。","The woman sank back to a sitting posture on the floor, and, covering her eyes with her hands, gave way to heart-broken sobs and wailings."
"“接着演下去！”蒂坎大喊，“娜恩！贝特！真是不懂规矩的村姑！在王子面前，你们就这么站着吗？跪下，你们这些下贱的渣滓，给他敬礼！”","“Let the show go on!” shouted Canty.“What, Nan!—what, Bet! mannerless wenches!Will ye stand in the Prince’s presence?Upon your knees, ye pauper scum, and do him reverence!”"
"说完，他又大声狂笑一番。女孩们开始小心翼翼地为弟弟求情。娜恩说：","He followed this with another horse-laugh.The girls began to plead timidly for their brother; and Nan said—"
"“就让他去睡觉吧，爸爸，睡觉休息后，他就不会再疯癫。求您，让他去吧。”","“An thou wilt but let him to bed, father, rest and sleep will heal his madness: prithee, do.”"
"“让他去吧，爸爸，”贝特说，“他比往常累。明天他就又是自己了，会勤快地去乞讨，不会再空手回家了。”","“Do, father,” said Bet; “he is more worn than is his wont.To-morrow will he be himself again, and will beg with diligence, and come not empty home again.”"
"这话让快活的父亲清醒了，脑袋突然想起了正事来。他生气地转向王子，说道：","This remark sobered the father’s joviality, and brought his mind to business.He turned angrily upon the Prince, and said—"
"“我们明天得付两个便士给这个洞的主人。两便士，你记着，这可是半年的房租钱，否则我们就得从这儿滚蛋。给我看看你这个懒人讨了些什么。”","“The morrow must we pay two pennies to him that owns this hole; two pennies, mark ye—all this money for a half-year’s rent, else out of this we go.Show what thou’st gathered with thy lazy begging.”"
"王子说道：“别拿你那些肮脏的事情冒犯我。我再跟你说一次，我是国王的儿子。”","The Prince said—“Offend me not with thy sordid matters.I tell thee again I am the King’s son.”"
"坎蒂硕大的手掌朝王子肩膀啪地打过去，王子踉跄一下，倒在了坎蒂那位善良的妻子的怀里。她紧紧地把他抱在胸口，用自己的身子为他挡住如倾盆大雨般的巴掌。害怕的女孩们退到了她们的墙角，而祖母急忙走上前来帮她儿子。王子从坎蒂夫人怀里挣脱出来，大声说道：","A sounding blow upon the Prince’s shoulder from Canty’s broad palm sent him staggering into goodwife Canty’s arms, which clasped him to her breast, and sheltered him from a pelting rain of cuffs and slaps by interposing her own person.The frightened girls retreated to their corner; but the grandmother stepped eagerly forward to assist her son.The Prince sprang away from Mrs. Canty, exclaiming—"
"“你不要为我受苦，夫人。让这些蠢猪打我一个人好了。”","“Thou shalt not suffer for me, madam.Let these swine do their will upon me alone.”"
"这话大大激怒了蠢猪们，他们立刻就打了过来。他们围着这个孩子噼里啪啦地一顿毒打，接着又打了女孩子们和她们的母亲，因为她们对受害者表现出了同情。","This speech infuriated the swine to such a degree that they set about their work without waste of time.Between them they belaboured the boy right soundly, and then gave the girls and their mother a beating for showing sympathy for the victim."
"“现在，”坎蒂说，“睡觉去吧，你们都去。这表演把我搞累了。”","“Now,” said Canty, “to bed, all of ye.The entertainment has tired me.”"
"灯熄了，这家子人歇息了。一听到一家之主和他的母亲打呼噜，明白他们睡着了，年轻的女孩们就爬到王子躺的地方，轻轻地为他盖上稻草和破衣服防寒。她们的母亲也爬过去，轻抚他的头发，一边为他哭，一边在耳边断断续续地低声说些安慰和怜惜的话。她还给他留了一口吃的，但是男孩子只觉得痛，一点胃口也没有——至少对没有味道的黑面包渣没胃口。他被她的勇敢和不顾一切地保护他和同情他的行为所感动，他用很高贵的、王子式的话向她道谢，并请求她去睡觉，忘记悲伤。他还补充说，他的父王会因为她的忠诚善良和奉献精神而奖赏她。他又说疯话，这让她的心又碎了。她反复地将他贴在胸口，然后满脸泪水地回到自己的床上。","The light was put out, and the family retired.As soon as the snorings of the head of the house and his mother showed that they were asleep, the young girls crept to where the Prince lay, and covered him tenderly from the cold with straw and rags; and their mother crept to him also, and stroked his hair, and cried over him, whispering broken words of comfort and compassion in his ear the while.She had saved a morsel for him to eat, also; but the boy’s pains had swept away all appetite—at least for black and tasteless crusts.He was touched by her brave and costly defence of him, and by her commiseration; and he thanked her in very noble and princely words, and begged her to go to her sleep and try to forget her sorrows.And he added that the King his father would not let her loyal kindness and devotion go unrewarded.This return to his ‘madness’ broke her heart anew, and she strained him to her breast again and again, and then went back, drowned in tears, to her bed."
"她躺着，一面思索，一面悲伤，慢慢地，她脑子里出现了个想法：不管是疯的还是正常的，这个男孩子有汤姆·坎蒂所没有的某种不可名状的东西。她无法形容，也说不出那到底是什么，但是凭她敏锐的母性本能，她似乎发现、察觉到了这种东西。要是这个男孩子终归真的不是她儿子，会怎么样呢?啊，太荒谬了！她虽然伤心烦恼，但想到这一点，她几乎笑了起来。无论如何，她怎么都放不下这个想法，还被它缠着。它追着她，骚扰她，粘住她，不肯退却，不甘被忽视。最后，她认识到，除非她想出一个测验方法，清楚地、毫无疑问地证明这小伙子是不是她的儿子，消除这些令人疲倦和担心的疑虑，否则自己将不得安宁。啊，是的，这就是摆脱困境的正确方法。于是，她立刻绞尽脑汁想测试的办法。可是，提出想法容易，找到解决方法就难了。她脑海里翻来覆去，想了一个又一个可能的测试，但都不得不放弃，因为它们都不绝对准确，不够完美，而她不满意有缺点的方法。显然，她费尽脑筋也无济于事，她似乎不得不放弃这件事儿了。这个灰心的念头出现在脑海中时，她听到了男孩子均匀的呼吸声，她知道他已经睡着了。她正听着，忽然，一声轻柔的惊叫打断了整齐的呼吸，那是像做恶梦时会发出的声音。这个偶然事件立马让她想到了一个计划，原来费劲想的所有计划加起来也比不了这个。她立刻就兴奋起来，悄悄地点上蜡烛，自言自语：“如果我刚刚看过他，我早知道了！自从小时候被烟灰洒到脸上那天起，他再也没有突然从梦中或思考中惊醒过，而是从那天起，他一直把手挡在眼睛上。而且，与其他人手掌向内不同，他总是手掌向外——我已经看过一百次了，从来都是这样，没有错过。是的，我马上就知道了，马上！”","As she lay thinking and mourning, the suggestion began to creep into her mind that there was an undefinable something about this boy that was lacking in Tom Canty, mad or sane.She could not describe it, she could not tell just what it was, and yet her sharp mother-instinct seemed to detect it and perceive it.What if the boy were really not her son, after all?Oh, absurd!She almost smiled at the idea, spite of her griefs and troubles.No matter, she found that it was an idea that would not ‘down,’ but persisted in haunting her.It pursued her, it harassed her, it clung to her, and refused to be put away or ignored.At last she perceived that there was not going to be any peace for her until she should devise a test that should prove, clearly and without question, whether this lad was her son or not, and so banish these wearing and worrying doubts.Ah, yes, this was plainly the right way out of the difficulty; therefore she set her wits to work at once to contrive that test.But it was an easier thing to propose than to accomplish.She turned over in her mind one promising test after another, but was obliged to relinquish them all—none of them were absolutely sure, absolutely perfect; and an imperfect one could not satisfy her.Evidently she was racking her head in vain—it seemed manifest that she must give the matter up.While this depressing thought was passing through her mind, her ear caught the regular breathing of the boy, and she knew he had fallen asleep.And while she listened, the measured breathing was broken by a soft, startled cry, such as one utters in a troubled dream.This chance occurrence furnished her instantly with a plan worth all her laboured tests combined.She at once set herself feverishly, but noiselessly, to work to relight her candle, muttering to herself, “Had I but seen him then, I should have known!Since that day, when he was little, that the powder burst in his face, he hath never been startled of a sudden out of his dreams or out of his thinkings, but he hath cast his hand before his eyes, even as he did that day; and not as others would do it, with the palm inward, but always with the palm turned outward—I have seen it a hundred times, and it hath never varied nor ever failed.Yes, I shall soon know, now!”"
"这时，她手里拿着微微发光的蜡烛，已经爬到了睡着的男孩子旁边。她小心谨慎地弯下腰，贴近他，压制住兴奋，几乎不敢呼吸，然后一下子将光照在他脸上，用指节敲了敲他耳边的地板。正在睡觉的男孩的眼睛猛然睁得大大的，惊吓地向四周看了看，但他的两只手却没有什么特别的动作。","By this time she had crept to the slumbering boy’s side, with the candle, shaded, in her hand.She bent heedfully and warily over him, scarcely breathing in her suppressed excitement, and suddenly flashed the light in his face and struck the floor by his ear with her knuckles.The sleeper’s eyes sprang wide open, and he cast a startled stare about him—but he made no special movement with his hands."
"惊讶和悲伤让这位可怜的夫人几乎觉得无助，但是她尽力隐藏了自己的情绪，哄着男孩子入睡，然后她又爬着离开，为她那极为失败的测试结果暗自伤心。她试图去相信，她的汤姆是因为疯癫才忘记了自己的习惯动作，但是她做不到。“不，”她说，“他的手没有疯，一个人不可能在这么短的时间内忘掉那么根深蒂固的习惯。啊，真是令我痛苦的一天啊！”","The poor woman was smitten almost helpless with surprise and grief; but she contrived to hide her emotions and to soothe the boy to sleep again; then she crept apart and communed miserably with herself upon the disastrous result of her experiment.She tried to believe that her Tom’s madness had banished this habitual gesture of his; but she could not do it.”No,” she said, “his hands are not mad; they could not unlearn so old a habit in so brief a time.Oh, this is a heavy day for me!”"
"但如今，希望像刚才的怀疑一样顽固。她无法接受这个测试结果，她必须再试一回——这次失败肯定只是个意外。所以，她过一段时间又第二次、第三次把男孩子从梦中惊醒，但结果都跟第一回一样。于是，她拖着身子回到床上，渐渐伤心地进入梦乡，嘴里还说着：“但是我不能够放弃他——啊，不，我不能，我不能——他一定是我的孩子！”","Still, hope was as stubborn now as doubt had been before; she could not bring herself to accept the verdict of the test; she must try the thing again—the failure must have been only an accident;  so she startled the boy out of his sleep a second and a third time, at intervals—with the same result which had marked the first test; then she dragged herself to bed, and fell sorrowfully asleep, saying, “But I cannot give him up—oh no, I cannot, I cannot—he must be my boy!”"
"可怜的母亲不再打扰他，王子也渐渐地不再觉得疼痛，极度的疲倦终于让他闭上了眼睛，沉沉地、安静地睡去了。几个钟头过去了，他仍睡得像个死人似的。这样过了四五个小时。然后，他开始从昏睡中醒过来。不一会儿，他半睡半醒地咕哝道：","The poor mother’s interruptions having ceased, and the Prince’s pains having gradually lost their power to disturb him, utter weariness at last sealed his eyes in a profound and restful sleep.Hour after hour slipped away, and still he slept like the dead.Thus four or five hours passed.Then his stupor began to lighten.Presently, while half asleep and half awake, he murmured—"
"“威廉爵士！”","“Sir William!”"
"过了会儿又说：","After a moment—"
"“哎，威廉·赫伯特爵士！你快过来，听听至今最奇怪的梦……威廉爵士！你在听吗？天啊，我真以为我变成了一个贫儿，而且……哎！守卫！威廉爵士！什么！房间里没有男仆伺候吗？哎呀！得受惩罚——”","“Ho, Sir William Herbert!Hie thee hither, and list to the strangest dream that ever ... Sir William!Dost hear?Man, I did think me changed to a pauper, and ... Ho there!Guards!Sir William!What!Is there no groom of the chamber in waiting?Alack!It shall go hard with—”"
"“你怎么啦？”有人在他旁边耳语，问道，“你在叫谁呢？”","“What aileth thee?” asked a whisper near him.“Who art thou calling?”"
"“威廉·赫伯特爵士。你是谁？”","“Sir William Herbert.Who art thou?”"
"“我？除了是你的姐姐娜恩，我还能是谁？噢，汤姆，我忘了！你已经疯了——可怜的人，你已经疯了。我宁愿自己永远不再醒过来，就不会再知道你疯了！但请你别乱说话，不然我们会被打死的！”","“I?Who should I be, but thy sister Nan?Oh, Tom, I had forgot!Thou’rt mad yet—poor lad, thou’rt mad yet: would I had never woke to know it again!But prithee master thy tongue, lest we be all beaten till we die!”"
"王子惊得半坐起来，但他全身青肿僵硬，剧烈的疼痛猛地把他拉回了现实。他哀嚎一声，躺回了他的脏稻草上，突然呻吟道：","The startled Prince sprang partly up, but a sharp reminder from his stiffened bruises brought him to himself, and he sank back among his foul straw with a moan and the ejaculation—"
"“唉！那么，不是做梦了！”","“Alas!It was no dream, then!”"
"一瞬间，已经被睡眠消除的沉重的悲痛和苦恼又向他袭来，他意识到自己不再是宫殿里受宠的、接受全国人民仰慕的目光的王子了，而是一个被遗弃的、穿着破衣烂衫的贫儿，一个住在只适合野兽住的洞里、与乞丐和小偷为伴的囚徒。","In a moment all the heavy sorrow and misery which sleep had banished were upon him again, and he realised that he was no longer a petted prince in a palace, with the adoring eyes of a nation upon him, but a pauper, an outcast, clothed in rags, prisoner in a den fit only for beasts, and consorting with beggars and thieves."
"正伤心的时候，他听到欢闹的声音和叫嚷，听起来显然不过一两个街区远。紧接着，传来了几声急促的敲门声。约翰·坎蒂的鼾声停了，说道：","In the midst of his grief he began to be conscious of hilarious noises and shoutings, apparently but a block or two away.The next moment there were several sharp raps at the door; John Canty ceased from snoring and said—"
"“谁在敲门？有什么事？”","“Who knocketh?What wilt thou?”"
"一个声音答道：","A voice answered—"
"“你知道你用棍子打了谁吗？”","“Know’st thou who it was thou laid thy cudgel on?”"
"“不知道。我不知道，也不关心。”","“No.Neither know I, nor care.”"
"“恐怕一会儿，你就不会这么说了。你要想保住你的脑袋，就只有逃走了。这会儿，他的灵魂正在升天呢。是那个神父，安德鲁神父！”","“Belike thou’lt change thy note eftsoons.An thou would save thy neck, nothing but flight may stead thee.The man is this moment delivering up the ghost.’Tis the priest, Father Andrew!”"
"“上帝慈悲！”坎蒂大声叫道。他把全家叫醒，粗声粗气地命令道：“都起来逃吧，否则就呆在这里等死！”","“God-a-mercy!” excliamed Canty.He roused his family, and hoarsely commanded, “Up with ye all and fly—or bide where ye are and perish!”"
"不到五分钟的时间，坎蒂一家子就到了街上，开始逃命。约翰·坎蒂抓着王子的手腕在黑暗中赶路，一面催他快走，一面低声警告他说：","Scarcely five minutes later were the Canty household in the street and flying for their lives.John Canty held the Prince by the wrist, and hurried him along the dark way, giving him this caution in a low voice—"
"“不准乱说话，你这个疯子，不要说我们的名字。我得赶紧换个名字，免得让法律的看家狗们嗅到我。别乱说话，我告诉你！”","“Mind thy tongue, thou mad fools, and speaks not our name.I will choose me a new name, speedily, to throw the law’s dogs off the scent.Mind thy tongue, I tell thee!”"
"他又对家里其他几个人咆哮道：","He growled these words to the rest of the family—"
"“如果我们不小心走散了，大家就去伦敦桥集合。不管谁，如果自己走到桥上最后一家亚麻布制品店那里，就在那儿等其他人到齐，然后我们再一起逃到萨瑟克。”","“If it so chance that we be separated, let each make for London Bridge; whoso findeth himself as far as the last linen-draper’s shop on the bridge, let him tarry there till the others be come, then will we flee into Southwark together.”"
"正在此时，这一家子突然从黑暗里走进了光亮处。不仅如此，有好多人聚在河边唱歌、跳舞、叫喊，他们也混入其中了。泰晤士河上下都点着篝火，一眼望不到头。伦敦桥上灯火通明，萨瑟克桥也是如此，整条河都被彩灯的闪烁和光辉照亮了。随着阵阵连续不断的爆炸声，天空中混杂着如流星般的绚丽的烟火和多如雨点的耀眼火花，把夜晚照得如同白昼。到处都是狂欢的人群，仿佛整个伦敦都沉浸在狂欢、自由之中。","At this moment the party burst suddenly out of darkness into light; and not only into light, but into the midst of a multitude of singing, dancing, and shouting people, massed together on the river frontage.There was a line of bonfires stretching as far as one could see, up and down the Thames; London Bridge was illuminated; Southwark Bridge likewise; the entire river was aglow with the flash and sheen of coloured lights; and constant explosions of fireworks filled the skies with an intricate commingling of shooting splendours and a thick rain of dazzling sparks that almost turned night into day; everywhere were crowds of revellers; all London seemed to be at large."
"约翰·坎蒂狠狠地骂了自己一句，下令撤回，但是已经太晚了。他和他的家人被那一窝蜂似的人群吞没了，立刻就被彻底拆散了。我们没把王子看成他的家人，坎蒂还在抓着他的手腕。王子现在看到了逃跑的希望，心跳得厉害。坎蒂正在人群中费力地往前挤。一个身材魁梧的船夫喝了酒十分兴奋，他觉得坎蒂无礼地撞了他，便将大手放在坎蒂的肩膀上，说：","John Canty delivered himself of a furious curse and commanded a retreat; but it was too late.He and his tribe were swallowed up in that swarming hive of humanity, and hopelessly separated from each other in an instant.We are not considering that the Prince was one of his tribe; Canty still kept his grip upon him.The Prince’s heart was beating high with hopes of escape, now.A burly waterman, considerably exalted with liquor, found himself rudely shoved by Canty in his efforts to plough through the crowd; he laid his great hand on Canty’s shoulder and said—"
"“别挤，这么着急上哪儿去啊，朋友？所有的人都很忠实，都在真正地度假，你要用肮脏的事情腐蚀你的灵魂吗？”","“Nay, whither so fast, friend?Dost canker thy soul with sordid business when all that be leal men and true make holiday?”"
"“我的事情是我自己的事，与你无关，”坎蒂粗野地说，“拿开你的手，让我过去。”","“Mine affairs are mine own, they concern thee not,” answered Canty, roughly; “take away thy hand and let me pass.”"
"“既然你这么认为，那么我跟你说，你要为威尔士王子喝一杯才能走。”船夫坚决挡住路，说道。","“Sith that is thy humour, thou’lt not pass, till thou’st drunk to the Prince of Wales, I tell thee that,” said the waterman, barring the way resolutely."
"“那给我杯子，快点，快点！”","“Give me the cup, then, and make speed, make speed!”"
"这时，其他狂欢者有了兴致。他们叫喊道：","Other revellers were interested by this time.They cried out—"
"“拿爱杯来，爱杯！让这个酸腐的流氓用爱杯喝，否则我们就拿他喂鱼。”","“The loving-cup, the loving-cup!Make the sour knave drink the loving-cup; else will we feed him to the fishes.”"
"于是，他们拿来了个很大的爱杯。那个船夫拿着一个杯柄，另一只手拿着一张假想的餐巾的角，按照古代的礼节和方式递给坎蒂，而坎蒂只得按照古代风俗，一只手拿住对面一个杯柄，另一只手拿下盖子。当然，这会儿，王子的手被松开了。他抓紧时间，冲到周围的人群里，消失了。一转眼，就再也找不到他了。在那样翻腾的人海中，如果将它比作大西洋的巨浪，那么他就是落入其中的一枚六便士硬币。","So a huge loving-cup was brought; the waterman, grasping it by one of its handles, and with the other hand bearing up the end of an imaginary napkin, presented it in due and ancient form to Canty, who had to grasp the opposite handle with one of his hands and take off the lid with the other, according to ancient custom.This left the Prince hand-free for a second, of course.He wasted no time, but dived among the forest of legs about him and disappeared.In another moment he could not have been harder to find, under that tossing sea of life, if its billows had been the Atlantic’s and he a lost sixpence."
"他很快意识到了这一事实，便不再想着约翰·坎蒂，干脆忙着考虑自己的事情。他也很快意识到了另一件事情。那就是，全市正在为一个假王子举办筵席，而不是他。他很容易地得出了结论：那个贫儿汤姆·坎蒂存心利用了这个千载难逢的机会，做了篡位者。","He very soon realised this fact, and straightway busied himself about his own affairs without further thought of John Canty.He quickly realised another thing, too.To wit, that a spurious Prince of Wales was being feasted by the city in his stead.He easily concluded that the pauper lad, Tom Canty, had deliberately taken advantage of his stupendous opportunity and become a usurper."
"所以，只有一条路可走，那就是去市政厅，让人们知道他，并公开指责这个冒名顶替者。他还决定给汤姆一点合理的心里准备时间，然后按照当时叛国罪的法律和惯例,对他执行绞刑、淹死，或是五马分尸。","Therefore there was but one course to pursue—find his way to the Guildhall, make him known, and denounce the impostor.He also made up his mind that Tom should be allowed a reasonable time for spiritual preparation, and then be hanged, drawn and quartered, according to the law and usage of the day in cases of high treason."
"第十一章 在市政厅","Chapter XI  At Guildhall"
"王室游艇在华丽的舰队的护航下，顺着泰晤士河而下，庄严地驶过大片张灯结彩的船只。空气里弥漫着音乐，欢乐的焰火给河岸镶上了褶皱边。远处的城市沐浴在温柔的灯光中，因为那里有无数看不见的篝火。在城市上方，有许多瘦长的塔尖耸入高空，塔尖上装有闪烁的灯，从远处望去，好像是镶着珠宝的矛向上竖着。舰队驶过时，岸上不断传来嘶哑的欢呼声，还有不停的烟花的闪光和爆炸声。","The royal barge, attended by its gorgeous fleet, took its stately way down the Thames through the wilderness of illuminated boats.The air was laden with music; the river banks were beruffled with joy-flames; the distant city lay in a soft luminous glow from its countless invisible bonfires; above it rose many a slender spire into the sky, incrusted with sparkling lights, wherefore in their remoteness they seemed like jewelled lances thrust aloft; as the fleet swept along, it was greeted from the banks with a continuous hoarse roar of cheers and the ceaseless flash and boom of artillery."
"对于半埋在丝绸坐垫里的汤姆·坎蒂来说，这些声音和这番景象真是奇观，说不出地壮丽和惊异。对于他旁边的小朋友们，伊丽莎白公主和简·格雷郡主来说，这算不上什么。","To Tom Canty, half buried in his silken cushions, these sounds and this spectacle were a wonder unspeakably sublime and astonishing.To his little friends at his side, the Princess Elizabeth and the Lady Jane Grey, they were nothing."
"舰队到达道格特区，驶过清澈的瓦溪(瓦溪水道已经消失，埋在几英亩大楼下有二百年了)到了巴科勒斯伯瑞街，经过住宅，穿过一座座挤满了狂欢人群的灯火辉煌的桥，最后停在一个水塘，就是现在的游艇大院，那是古伦敦城的中心。汤姆下了船，他和他华丽的队伍穿过齐普赛街，从老犹太街和贝辛哈街，再到市政厅，进行了一次短途游行。 ","Arrived at the Dowgate, the fleet was towed up the limpid Walbrook (whose channel has now been for two centuries buried out of sight under acres of buildings) to Bucklersbury, past houses and under bridges populous with merry-makers and brilliantly lighted, and at last came to a halt in a basin where now is Barge Yard, in the centre of the ancient city of London.Tom disembarked, and he and his gallant procession crossed Cheapside and made a short march through the Old Jewry and Basinghall Street to the Guildhall."
"市长和城邦元老戴着金链子，穿着猩红色国袍，以恰当的礼节接待了汤姆和小公主们。传令官、权杖官和市剑官走在前面，将汤姆他们引至大厅顶部一个巨大的穹顶下。服侍汤姆和他的两个小朋友的大臣和贵族夫人们站在了他们椅子后面。","Tom and his little ladies were received with due ceremony by the Lord Mayor and the Fathers of the City, in their gold chains and scarlet robes of state, and conducted to a rich canopy of state at the head of the great hall, preceded by heralds making proclamation, and by the Mace and the City Sword.The lords and ladies who were to attend upon Tom and his two small friends took their places behind their chairs."
"宫廷的大人物和其他贵族客人在低一些的桌上坐下，与城邦要人坐在了一起。下议院议员们就坐在大厅中央的许多桌子前。古代的城邦守护者戈格和梅戈格巨人高高在上，居高临下地注视着眼前的这一幕景象。早在不知多少年前，他们就已熟悉了这一幕。一阵响亮的号声和一声宣告之后，左边墙的高处出现了一个胖胖的男仆役长，身后跟着的随从们十分庄严地端着上好的大牛肉块。牛肉热气腾腾的，正好可以下刀。　","At a lower table the Court grandees and other guests of noble degree were seated, with the magnates of the city; the commoners took places at a multitude of tables on the main floor of the hall.From their lofty vantage-ground the giants Gog and Magog, the ancient guardians of the city, contemplated the spectacle below them with eyes grown familiar to it in forgotten generations.There was a bugle-blast and a proclamation, and a fat butler appeared in a high perch in the leftward wall, followed by his servitors bearing with impressive solemnity a royal baron of beef, smoking hot and ready for the knife."
"祷告完毕，汤姆（在指导下）起身与伊丽莎白公主一起端着巨大的金爱杯喝酒，屋里所有人都随着起身。爱杯从伊丽莎白公主手中传给了简郡主，然后传给宴会上的众人。宴会就这么开始了。","After grace, Tom (being instructed) rose—and the whole house with him—and drank from a portly golden loving-cup with the Princess Elizabeth; from her it passed to the Lady Jane, and then traversed the general assemblage.So the banquet began."
"午夜时分，狂欢达到高潮。现在，旧时让人羡慕的一幕如画般的场景就要来临了。对这一场景的描述现在还可以找到。一名亲眼目睹此景的史官用古雅的文笔描写道：","By midnight the revelry was at its height.Now came one of those picturesque spectacles so admired in that old day.A description of it is still extant in the quaint wording of a chronicler who witnessed it:"
"“人们让出空地，不一会儿，走进来一位男爵和一位伯爵，他们穿着土耳其款式的织锦撒金长袍，头上戴着深红色天鹅绒的帽子，大大的金卷用两把叫做弯刀的剑夹上，用金色的织锦挂着。接着，又来了一位男爵和一位伯爵，他们穿着黄色绸缎做的俄罗斯式长袍，上有弯弯曲曲的白色缎子，每个白缎弯处又是一段弯曲的猩红色缎带，头上戴了灰色的毛皮帽子。两个人都手拿短柄斧，脚穿长筒靴，靴子尖（尖有一英尺长）向上翻着。他们之后是一位骑士，接着是海军上将。他带了五个贵族，个个穿着猩红天鹅绒紧身衣，衣服后面开得很低，前面开到锁骨处，胸前带着银链子，外面披着猩红色缎子做的短斗篷，头上戴了舞者式样的帽子，上面插着雉的羽毛。他们的衣着是普鲁士式的。大约一百个火炬手身穿猩红色和绿色缎子的服装。他们脸上黑黑的，像摩尔人似的。之后来了个mommarye。接着，乔装打扮的艺人跳着舞，贵族老爷和夫人们也疯狂地跳舞，光看着就是一种快乐。”","‘Space being made, presently entered a baron and an earl appareled after the Turkish fashion in long robes of bawdkin powdered with gold; hats on their heads of crimson velvet, with great rolls of gold, girded with two swords, called scimitars, hanging by great bawdricks of gold.Next came yet another baron and another earl, in two long gowns of yellow satin, traversed with white satin, and in every bend of white was a bend of crimson satin, after the fashion of Russia, with furred hats of gray on their heads; either of them having an hatchet in their hands, and boots with pykes’ (points a foot long), ‘turned up.And after them came a knight, then the Lord High Admiral, and with him five nobles, in doublets of crimson velvet, voyded low on the back and before to the cannell-bone, laced on the breasts with chains of silver; and over that, short cloaks of crimson satin, and on their heads hats after the dancers’ fashion, with pheasants’ feathers in them.These were appareled after the fashion of Prussia.The torchbearers, which were about an hundred, were appareled in crimson satin and green, like Moors, their faces black.Next came in a mommarye.Then the minstrels, who were disguised, danced; and the lords and ladies did wildly dance also, that it was a pleasure to behold.’"
"坐在高高的位置上的汤姆正观看着这“疯狂”的舞蹈，沉浸在脚下俗丽的人们旋转喧闹所营造出的这如万花筒般令人眼花缭乱的各种色彩里。而与此同时，身着破衣烂衫的真正的威尔士王子正在大声宣布他的正当权利和所蒙受的冤屈，指责这个冒名顶替者，吵着要进市政厅的大门！人群对这个插曲表现出极高的热情，他们向前挤，伸着脖子去看那个闹事的小家伙。不一会儿，他们开始嘲弄他，取笑他，有意煽起他更强烈、也更有趣的怒气。　羞辱的眼泪涌进眼眶，但是他坚守立场，不失王家风范地对抗这群暴徒。接着又是嘲笑，加倍的取笑刺痛了他，他大声说道：","And while Tom, in his high seat, was gazing upon this ‘wild’ dancing, lost in admiration of the dazzling commingling of kaleidoscopic colours which the whirling turmoil of gaudy figures below him presented, the ragged but real little Prince of Wales was proclaiming his rights and his wrongs, denouncing the impostor, and clamouring for admission at the gates of Guildhall!The crowd enjoyed this episode prodigiously, and pressed forward and craned their necks to see the small rioter.Presently they began to taunt him and mock at him, purposely to goad him into a higher and still more entertaining fury.Tears of mortification sprang to his eyes, but he stood his ground and defied the mob right royally.Other taunts followed, added mockings stung him, and he exclaimed—"
"“我跟你们再说一遍，你们这群没有礼貌的疯狗，我是威尔士王子！我确实无助，没有朋友，没人说安慰我的话，没人在我需要的时候帮助我，但是我不会屈服，我会坚守我的立场！”","“I tell ye again, you pack of unmannerly curs, I am the Prince of Wales!And all forlorn and friendless as I be, with none to give me word of grace or help me in my need, yet will not I be driven from my ground, but will maintain it!”"
"“不管你是不是王子，都一样，你是个勇敢的家伙，也不会没有朋友！","“Though thou be prince or no prince, ’tis all one, thou be’st a gallant lad, and not friendless neither!"
"我站在你这边，就足以证明这一点。记着我告诉你，你可能有个比迈尔斯·亨登还差劲的朋友，不过不要费力找他了。省省你的小下巴，我的孩子，我天生就会说这些低级的狗窝里的胡话。”讲话者的穿着、长相、举止都有些像唐·凯撒·德巴赞。他个头很高，身材匀称，肌肉健壮。他的紧身上衣和裤子都是用精美的布料做的，却已经褪了色，磨破了，衣服上的金饰带也不幸失去了光泽；破旧的领子飞边皱巴巴的；软塌塌的帽子上的羽毛给弄破了，看着不整洁，一点都不体面；身体一侧佩了一把轻巧细长的剑，铁剑鞘已经生了锈。他这副神气活现的架势立刻就让人们将他看成了扰乱宴会的人。这位古怪人物的一番话遭到了一片嘲讽和讥笑。有人喊道：“又一个乔装的王子！”“说话注意点，朋友，他或许很危险呢！”“哎呀,他看起来是这样的，留心他的眼睛！”“把那个家伙抢过来，跟那个年轻人一起丢到饮马池去！”","Here stand I by thy side to prove it; and mind I tell thee thou might’st have a worser friend than Miles Hendon and yet not tire thy legs with seeking.Rest thy small jaw, my child; I talk the language of these base kennel-rats like to a very native.”The speaker was a sort of Don Caesar de Bazan in dress, aspect, and bearing.He was tall, trim-built, muscular.His doublet and trunks were of rich material, but faded and threadbare, and their gold-lace adornments were sadly tarnished; his ruff was rumpled and damaged; the plume in his slouched hat was broken and had a bedraggled and disreputable look; at his side he wore a long rapier in a rusty iron sheath; his swaggering carriage marked him at once as a ruffler of the camp.The speech of this fantastic figure was received with an explosion of jeers and laughter.Some cried, “’Tis another prince in disguise!”“’Ware thy tongue, friend: belike he is dangerous!”“Marry, he looketh it—mark his eye!”“Pluck the lad from him—to the horse-pond wi’ the cub!”"
"一想到这个高兴的主意，立即有一只手搭在王子身上了。这个陌生人立刻拔出长剑,用刀背砰地重打上去，那个爱管闲事的人就倒在地上了。接着有二十多个声音喊道：“杀了这条狗！杀了他！杀了他！”暴徒围拢了武士，他退到了墙边，开始像疯子一样拿着他的长剑乱打一通。几个受了伤的人四处爬去，但是暴徒的浪潮带着丝毫未减的怒气越过倒地的人，朝着战士涌了上来。","Instantly a hand was laid upon the Prince, under the impulse of this happy thought; as instantly the stranger’s long sword was out and the meddler went to the earth under a sounding thump with the flat of it.The next moment a score of voices shouted, “Kill the dog!Kill him!Kill him!”And the mob closed in on the warrior, who backed himself against a wall and began to lay about him with his long weapon like a madman.His victims sprawled this way and that, but the mob-tide poured over their prostrate forms and dashed itself against the champion with undiminished fury."
"他似乎就要完了，几乎死定了。而就在这时，突然传来一阵号声，有人喊道：“让路，国王的使者来了！”于是，一队骑兵向暴徒冲过来，他们撒腿跑得远远的，生怕被马腿踢到。这个勇敢的陌生人用胳膊挽起王子，很快逃离了危险和人群。","His moments seemed numbered, his destruction certain, when suddenly a trumpet-blast sounded, a voice shouted, “Way for the King’s messenger!” and a troop of horsemen came charging down upon the mob, who fled out of harm’s reach as fast as their legs could carry them.The bold stranger caught up the Prince in his arms, and was soon far away from danger and the multitude."
"我们回到市政厅来吧。忽然，在狂欢的喧闹声和雷鸣般的响声中，传来了一阵清脆响亮的号声。一切立刻安静了下来——非常安静，只有一个提高了的嗓音。那是宫殿的使者，他大声宣布，众人都站起来听着。","Return us within the Guildhall.Suddenly, high above the jubilant roar and thunder of the revel broke the clear peal of a bugle-note.There was instant silence—a deep hush; then a single voice raised—that of the messenger from the palace—and began to pipe forth a proclamation, the whole multitude standing listening."
"结束语十分严肃沉重：","The closing words, solemnly pronounced, were—"
"“国王驾崩了！”","“The King is dead!”"
"在场的所有人都低头含胸地静默了一会儿，然后，所有人都跪下来，朝汤姆伸出双手，大声高呼，声音几乎震动了建筑：","The great assemblage bent their heads upon their breasts with one accord; remained so, in profound silence, a few moments; then all sank upon their knees in a body, stretched out their hands toward Tom, and a mighty shout burst forth that seemed to shake the building—"
"“国王万岁！”","“Long live the King!”"
"可怜的汤姆眼神茫然地俯瞰远处这令人惊呆的场景，最后，他的目光恍恍惚惚地落在身边跪着的公主们身上，之后又落在赫特福德伯爵身上。忽然，他脸上一亮，想起了一个主意。他在赫特福德伯爵耳边低声说道：","Poor Tom’s dazed eyes wandered abroad over this stupefying spectacle, and finally rested dreamily upon the kneeling princesses beside him, a moment, then upon the Earl of Hertford.A sudden purpose dawned in his face.He said, in a low tone, at Lord Hertford’s ear—"
"“以您的信仰和荣誉，真诚地回答我！如果我在这里颁布一道只有国王有权颁布的命令，大家会服从吗？会不会有人站起来反对？”","“Answer me truly, on thy faith and honour!Uttered I here a command, the which none but a king might hold privilege and prerogative to utter, would such commandment be obeyed, and none rise up to say me nay?”"
"“不会反对，我的陛下，整个王国的人的都不会。您本身就是英国的最高权威。您是国王——您的话就是法律。”","“None, my liege, in all these realms.In thy person bides the majesty of England.Thou art the king—thy word is law.”"
"汤姆十分兴奋，他用坚定且认真的声调说道：","Tom responded, in a strong, earnest voice, and with great animation—"
"“那么从今天开始，国王的法律将是仁慈的法律，永不再是血腥的法律！起来，去吧！到伦敦塔，说国王下令，免除诺福克公爵的死罪！”","“Then shall the king’s law be law of mercy, from this day, and never more be law of blood!Up from thy knees and away!To the Tower, and say the King decrees the Duke of Norfolk shall not die!”"
"人们听了这话，连忙口口相传，传遍了整个大厅。赫特福德匆忙离开的时候，突然响起另一声惊天动地的呼喊：","The words were caught up and carried eagerly from lip to lip far and wide over the hall, and as Hertford hurried from the presence, another prodigious shout burst forth—"
"“血腥的统治结束了！英国国王爱德华万岁！”","“The reign of blood is ended!Long live Edward, King of England!”"
"第十二章 王子和他的救星","Chapter XII  The Prince and His Deliverer"
"一逃离了那群暴徒，迈尔斯·亨登和小王子就沿着通向河的后巷后街大步往前走。在他们接近伦敦桥前，一路上一直畅通无阻的。然后他们又走进了人群中，亨登一直紧紧抓着王子的——不，是国王的手腕。这个天大的新闻已经传出来了，男孩很快就知道了，因为他听到无数个声音都在说：“国王驾崩了！”。噩耗让可怜的小流浪者心生寒意，身体打了个冷战。他明白自己失去了多么重要的人，心里十分悲凉，因为这位其他人都害怕的无情暴君总是对他很温柔。眼睛里涌上来的泪水模糊了他的视线。一瞬间，他觉得自己是上帝所造万物中最无助的、被遗弃的、孤独的一个。接着，传来另一声响彻夜空的声音：“国王爱德华六世万岁！”这使他双眼发亮，自豪感充满了全身，一直到指尖。“啊，”他心想，“这感觉真是既伟大又奇怪——我是国王！”","As soon as Miles Hendon and the little prince were clear of the mob, they struck down through back lanes and alleys toward the river.Their way was unobstructed until they approached London Bridge; then they ploughed into the multitude again, Hendon keeping a fast grip upon the Prince’s—no, the King’s—wrist.The tremendous news was already abroad, and the boy learned it from a thousand voices at once—“The King is dead!”The tidings struck a chill to the heart of the poor little waif, and sent a shudder through his frame.He realised the greatness of his loss, and was filled with a bitter grief; for the grim tyrant who had been such a terror to others had always been gentle with him.The tears sprang to his eyes and blurred all objects.For an instant he felt himself the most forlorn, outcast, and forsaken of God’s creatures—then another cry shook the night with its far-reaching thunders: “Long live King Edward the Sixth!”And this made his eyes kindle, and thrilled him with pride to his fingers’ ends.“Ah,” he thought, “how grand and strange it seems—I AM KING!”"
"我们的朋友慢慢地穿过桥上的人群。这座桥已经矗立了六百年，这么多年一直是一条吵闹、拥挤的大道。这座桥颇为奇异，因为沿着桥的两边，一直从这边的河岸到河对岸，挤满了林林总总的商店和店铺，上面是各户的住处。伦敦桥本身成了一个小镇。它有自己的旅馆、酒馆、面包店、缝纫用品店、食物市场、制造商，甚至还有自己的教堂。伦敦桥俯瞰着它所连接在一起的两位邻居——伦敦和萨瑟克。它们和城郊一样还过得去，但是在其他方面并不特别重要。可以说，它是一个浓缩的社会。它是个狭窄的城镇，只有一条五分之一英里长的街道，人口只相当于一个村庄的人口，镇里的人彼此都很熟悉，连彼此的父母辈都认识，还知道所有的家庭琐事。当然，它有自己的贵族，都是些体面的老家族——屠户、面包师，还有不知做什么的家族，在这里也有五六百年的历史了，他们对伦敦桥从头到尾的光辉历史和它那奇异的传奇都知道得一清二楚。他们总是说着关于桥的话，想着桥的事，就连说谎也像桥一样又长，又直接，又充实。这里，只不过是一群目光短浅、愚昧无知而且自负自大的人们。孩子们在伦敦桥出生、成长、变老，一直到最后死去，都不曾踏上世界上任何其他的土地，除了伦敦桥。这些人想当然地以为，强大而冗长的队伍日夜穿梭在这条街上，伴随着乱哄哄的呼喊、嚎叫声，伴随着马的嘶声、牛的叫声、羊的咩声和低沉的隆隆的踏步声，以为这是世界上唯一一件重大的事情，而他们似乎拥有这一切。实际上他们确实是，至少他们能在窗口展示这些，而他们为了报酬也这么做了，也就是每当归来的国王或英雄让它短暂地光鲜起来时。除了这里，再也找不到其他地方能容纳又长又直的、不间断的行军队列。","Our friends threaded their way slowly through the throngs upon the bridge.This structure, which had stood for six hundred years, and had been a noisy and populous thoroughfare all that time, was a curious affair, for a closely packed rank of stores and shops, with family quarters overhead, stretched along both sides of it, from one bank of the river to the other.The Bridge was a sort of town to itself; it had its inn, its beer-houses, its bakeries, its haberdasheries, its food markets, its manufacturing industries, and even its church.It looked upon the two neighbours which it linked together—London and Southwark—as being well enough as suburbs, but not otherwise particularly important.It was a close corporation, so to speak; it was a narrow town, of a single street a fifth of a mile long, its population was but a village population and everybody in it knew all his fellow-townsmen intimately, and had known their fathers and mothers before them—and all their little family affairs into the bargain.It had its aristocracy, of course—its fine old families of butchers, and bakers, and what-not, who had occupied the same old premises for five or six hundred years, and knew the great history of the Bridge from beginning to end, and all its strange legends; and who always talked bridgy talk, and thought bridgy thoughts, and lied in a long, level, direct, substantial bridgy way.It was just the sort of population to be narrow and ignorant and self-conceited.Children were born on the Bridge, were reared there, grew to old age, and finally died without ever having set a foot upon any part of the world but London Bridge alone.Such people would naturally imagine that the mighty and interminable procession which moved through its street night and day, with its confused roar of shouts and cries, its neighings and bellowing and bleatings and its muffled thunder-tramp, was the one great thing in this world, and themselves somehow the proprietors of it.And so they were, in effect—at least they could exhibit it from their windows, and did—for a consideration—whenever a returning king or hero gave it a fleeting splendour, for there was no place like it for affording a long, straight, uninterrupted view of marching columns."
"出生成长在桥上的人觉得别的地方的生活无聊而空虚，难以忍受。 历史上，曾有一个人七十一岁时离开桥，回到乡下。可他只能在床上翻来覆去，无法入睡。那里太安静了，安静得让人痛苦难受，而且压抑不堪。他给弄得疲惫不堪，最后，他一副皮包骨头、形容枯槁的鬼样子，逃回了自己的老家。伴着河水拍岸的催眠曲和伦敦桥上轰隆隆的车轮撞击声，他安静地睡了，进入了愉快的梦乡。","Men born and reared upon the Bridge found life unendurably dull and inane elsewhere.History tells of one of these who left the Bridge at the age of seventy-one and retired to the country.But he could only fret and toss in his bed; he could not go to sleep, the deep stillness was so painful, so awful, and so oppressive.When he was worn out with it, at last, he fled back to his old home, a lean and haggard spectre, and fell peacefully to rest and pleasant dreams under the lulling music of the lashing waters and the boom and crash and thunder of London Bridge."
"在我们现在所写的那个年代，伦敦桥是孩子们的英国历史“实物教学对象”，我指的是桥头的铁钉上挂着的名人的乌青腐烂的脑袋。不过我们跑题了。","In the times of which we are writing, the Bridge furnished ‘object lessons’ in English history for its children—namely, the livid and decaying heads of renowned men impaled upon iron spikes atop of its gateways.But we digress."
"亨登的住处就在桥上的小旅馆里。他带着他的小朋友走近门口时，一个粗哑的嗓音说道：","Hendon’s lodgings were in the little inn on the Bridge.As he neared the door with his small friend, a rough voice said—"
"“啊，你终于来了！我告诉你，你再也逃不掉了。如果狠狠揍你一顿能让你吸取教训，你就不会再让我们等了。”约翰·坎蒂伸过手来去抓男孩。","“So, thou’rt come at last!Thou’lt not escape again, I warrant thee; and if pounding thy bones to a pudding can teach thee somewhat, thou’lt not keep us waiting another time, mayhap,”—and John Canty put out his hand to seize the boy."
"迈尔斯·亨登走过来，说道：","Miles Hendon stepped in the way and said—"
"“等一等，朋友。我觉得你没必要这么粗鲁。这个小伙子是你什么人？”","“Not too fast, friend.Thou art needlessly rough, methinks.What is the lad to thee?”"
"“你真是个喜欢多管闲事的人，他是我儿子。”","“If it be any business of thine to make and meddle in others’ affairs, he is my son.”"
"“这不是真的！” 小国王愤怒地喊道。","“’Tis a lie!” cried the little King, hotly."
"“实话说，我相信你，不管你的小脑袋是健全还是有问题，我的孩子。但是，不管这个卑鄙的恶棍是不是你父亲，你都不能跟着他，像他恐吓你的那样让他殴打、虐待你。那么，你应该更喜欢跟我在一起。”","“Boldly said, and I believe thee, whether thy small headpiece be sound or cracked, my boy.But whether this scurvy ruffian be thy father or no, ’tis all one, he shall not have thee to beat thee and abuse, according to his threat, so thou prefer to bide with me.”"
"“是的，是的。我不认识他，我讨厌他，我宁愿死也不跟他走。”“那么，就这样了，没什么好再说的了。”","“I do, I do—I know him not, I loathe him, and will die before I will go with him.”“Then ’tis settled, and there is nought more to say.”"
"“既然这样，我们倒要看看！”约翰·坎蒂大声说道，越过亨登去抓男孩，“来点儿暴力，看他——”","“We will see, as to that!”  exclaimed John Canty, striding past Hendon to get at the boy; “by force shall he—”"
"“你这个禽兽、废物！如果你敢碰他一下，我就啐死你！” 亨登挡在中间，手放在剑把上，说道。坎蒂往后一退。“现在，你给我听着，”亨登接着说道，“如果有像你这样的暴徒欺负他，或者想要杀了他，我一定会挺身保护他。你觉得我现在会让他去送死吗？因为不管你是不是他父亲——说实话，我觉得那是扯谎——与其让这个孩子生活在你的毒手之下，不如让他痛快体面地死了的好。所以赶快滚蛋，我不喜欢跟你啰嗦，我天生就没耐性。”","“If thou do but touch him, thou animated offal; I will spit thee like a goose!” said Hendon, barring the way and laying his hand upon his sword hilt.Canty drew back.“Now mark ye,” continued Hendon, “I took this lad under my protection when a mob of such as thou would have mishandled him, mayhap killed him; dost imagine I will desert him now to a worser fate?—for whether thou art his father or no—and sooth to say, I think it is a lie—a decent swift death was better for such a lad than life in such brute hands as thine.So go thy ways, and set quick about it, for I like not much bandying of words, being not over-patient in my nature.”"
"约翰·坎蒂走开了，嘴里还喃喃地威胁和咒骂着些什么。然后，他被人群吞没，从视线里消失了。亨登吩咐人将饭菜送上来，然后和他照管的人一起上了三段楼梯，到了他的房间。这是一间简陋的房间，里面有一张破旧的床和一些零散的旧家具，两支暗淡的蜡烛发出昏暗的光。小国王挪到床上躺下，他又饿又累，快支撑不住了。他几乎整个白天和晚上都在走路（这时已是凌晨两三点钟），其间什么东西都没吃。他迷迷糊糊地低语：","John Canty moved off, muttering threats and curses, and was swallowed from sight in the crowd.Hendon ascended three flights of stairs to his room, with his charge, after ordering a meal to be sent thither.It was a poor apartment, with a shabby bed and some odds and ends of old furniture in it, and was vaguely lighted by a couple of sickly candles.The little King dragged himself to the bed and lay down upon it, almost exhausted with hunger and fatigue.He had been on his feet a good part of a day and a night (for it was now two or three o’clock in the morning), and had eaten nothing meantime.He murmured drowsily—"
"“等摆好了饭桌，请叫我一声。”然后，他立刻沉沉地睡去了。","“Prithee call me when the table is spread,” and sank into a deep sleep immediately."
"亨登的眼睛里闪着一丝笑意，他自言自语道：","A smile twinkled in Hendon’s eye, and he said to himself—"
"“的确，这个小叫化子跑到别人房里，占用了别人的床，样子却那么自然而从容，好像这都是他的似的，连一句客气话也没有，连句‘别见怪’、‘不好意思’都没说。他疯疯癫癫地称自己是威尔士王子，居然还真的大胆地端着这种派头。无依无靠的可怜的孩子，他一定是受尽了人间的折磨才疯了的。嗯，我会做他的朋友。我救了他，而他对我有强大的吸引力，我已经喜欢上了这个说话狂妄的小捣蛋鬼。他对那些无耻的暴民回以高傲的蔑视，多么像个战士啊！现在他睡着了，脸上的忧虑和悲伤也随之消失了，显得多么清秀、甜美和温和。我会教导他，我会治好他的病。是的，我会做他的大哥哥，照料他，看顾他。如果有谁羞辱或者伤害他，那就赶紧去做件寿衣，因为我就算赴汤蹈火也要杀了他，到时他会用得着寿衣的！”","“By the mass, the little beggar takes to one’s quarters and usurps one’s bed with as natural and easy a grace as if he owned them—with never a by-your-leave or so-please-it-you, or anything of the sort.In his diseased ravings he called himself the Prince of Wales, and bravely doth he keep up the character.Poor little friendless rat, doubtless his mind has been disordered with ill-usage.Well, I will be his friend; I have saved him, and it draweth me strongly to him; already I love the bold-tongued little rascal.How soldier-like he faced the smutty rabble and flung back his high defiance!And what a comely, sweet and gentle face he hath, now that sleep hath conjured away its troubles and its griefs.I will teach him; I will cure his malady; yea, I will be his elder brother, and care for him and watch over him; and whoso would shame him or do him hurt may order his shroud, for though I be burnt for it he shall need it!”"
"他向男孩弯下腰，和蔼、怜惜地凝视着他，轻轻地拍了拍稚嫩的脸颊，棕色的大手将他乱蓬蓬的卷发向后缕了缕。男孩的身体微微抖动了一下。亨登咕哝道：","He bent over the boy and contemplated him with kind and pitying interest, tapping the young cheek tenderly and smoothing back the tangled curls with his great brown hand.A slight shiver passed over the boy’s form.Hendon muttered—"
"“瞧瞧，不给他盖被子，就让他这么躺着，让他得要命的感冒，这真像男人做的事情啊。那我应该做什么呢？把他抱到被褥里会弄醒他，他太需要睡觉了。”","“See, now, how like a man it was to let him lie here uncovered and fill his body with deadly rheums.Now what shall I do?’Twill wakes him to take him up and put him within the bed, and he sorely needeth sleep.”"
"他四下里看看，想找件其他什么给他盖上，却没找到。于是，他脱下自己的紧身衣，一面给小家伙裹上，一面自言自语：“我习惯了刺骨的风和单薄的衣服，我可不在意感冒！”然后，他在房间里来回走动，以保持血液流动，一边还像刚刚那样自言自语。","He looked about for extra covering, but finding none, doffed his doublet and wrapped the lad in it, saying, “I am used to nipping air and scant apparel, ’tis little I shall mind the cold!”—then walked up and down the room, to keep his blood in motion, soliloquising as before."
"“他脑袋受了伤，才以为自己是威尔士王子。说我们现在还有威尔士王子是很奇怪的，因为过去的王子已经不再是王子，而是国王了。因为这可怜的小家伙一直都在妄想，所以不会想到现在应该不再叫自己王子，而应改叫自己国王了……因为关在他乡的地牢里，我已经七年没有听到家乡的消息了。如果我父亲还活着，他一定会欢迎这个可怜的家伙，并看在我的份上，慷慨地让他住下，而我善良的大哥阿瑟也会这么做。如果休——我那另一个狼心狗肺的弟弟想要多管闲事，我就扭断他的脖子！是的，我们要回那里，而且得立即动身。”","“His injured mind persuades him he is Prince of Wales; ’twill be odd to have a Prince of Wales still with us, now that he that was the prince is prince no more, but king—for this poor mind is set upon the one fantasy, and will not reason out that now it should cast by the prince and call itself the king...If my father liveth still, after these seven years that I have heard nought from home in my foreign dungeon, he will welcome the poor lad and give him generous shelter for my sake; so will my good elder brother, Arthur; my other brother, Hugh—but I will crack his crown an he interfere, the fox-hearted, ill-conditioned animal!Yes, thither will we fare—and straightway, too.”"
"一个仆人端着热腾腾的饭菜走进来，放在一张小松木桌子上，把椅子摆好后就离开了，让这些囊中羞涩的客人自己照顾自己。门甩上的声音吵醒了男孩，他猛地坐起来，高兴地扫视周围。接着，他脸上显出伤心的神情，长叹了口气，自言自语道：“哎呀，刚只是个梦，可怜的我啊！”然后，他看到了迈尔斯·亨登的紧身衣，又转头看了看亨登，明白了他为自己做的牺牲，于是温柔地说道：","A servant entered with a smoking meal, disposed it upon a small deal table, placed the chairs, and took his departure, leaving such cheap lodgers as these to wait upon themselves.The door slammed after him, and the noise woke the boy, who sprang to a sitting posture, and shot a glad glance about him; then a grieved look came into his face and he murmured to himself, with a deep sigh, “Alack, it was but a dream, woe is me!”Next he noticed Miles Hendon’s doublet—glanced from that to Hendon, comprehended the sacrifice that had been made for him, and said, gently—"
"“你对我好，是的，你对我非常好。拿着，穿上它，我不用了。”","“Thou art good to me, yes; thou art very good to me.Take it and put it on—I shall not need it more.”"
"然后，他起身走到角落里的脸盆架边，站在那儿，等着什么。亨登高兴地说：","Then he got up and walked to the washstand in the corner and stood there, waiting.Hendon said in a cheery voice—"
"“我们要吃一顿丰盛的晚餐了，饭菜都是香喷喷、热腾腾的，你睡了会儿，再吃了饭，就又是一个小男子汉了，别怕！”","“We’ll have a right hearty sup and bite, now, for everything is savoury and smoking hot, and that and thy nap together will make thee a little man again, never fears!”"
"男孩没有答话，而是直直地盯着这位高个子的佩剑骑士，眼神里充满了严肃的惊讶，还有点不耐烦。亨登迷惑不解地问道：","The boy made no answer, but bent a steady look, that was filled with grave surprise, and also somewhat touched with impatience, upon the tall knight of the sword.Hendon was puzzled, and said—"
"“怎么了？”","“What’s amiss?”"
"“善良的先生，我要洗漱。”","“Good sir, I would wash me.”"
"“啊，就这事？你想做什么都不需要问迈尔斯·亨登。你可以使用他的所有东西，自便就好，别客气。”","“Oh, is that all?Ask no permission of Miles Hendon for aught thou cravest.Make thyself perfectly free here, and welcome, with all that are his belongings.”"
"男孩还是站着没有动，而且他不耐烦的小脚在地板上跺了一两下。亨登完全不知所措。他说：","Still the boy stood, and moved not; more, he tapped the floor once or twice with his small impatient foot.Hendon was wholly perplexed.Said he—"
"“我的天，怎么了？”","“Bless us, what is it?”"
"“请倒水，别说那么多！”","“Prithee pour the water, and make not so many words!”"
"亨登忍住了大笑，自言自语道：“我的老天爷啊，好大的派头！” 他赶紧走上前去，照这个傲慢无礼的小家伙吩咐的做了。然后，他站一边发呆，直到又听到一声命令：“过来——拿毛巾来！”他才惊醒过来。他从男孩的眼皮底下拿起一条毛巾，一言不发地将毛巾递给了他。这会儿，他开始清洗自己的脸，而他收养的孩子自己坐在了桌子旁，准备开始吃饭。亨登匆忙洗了一下，就将另一把椅子拉到桌子旁。正要坐下，男孩忽然愤怒地说道：","Hendon, suppressing a horse-laugh, and saying to himself, “By all the saints, but this is admirable!” stepped briskly forward and did the small insolent’s bidding; then stood by, in a sort of stupefaction, until the command, “Come—the towel!” woke him sharply up.He took up a towel, from under the boy’s nose, and handed it to him without comment.He now proceeded to comfort his own face with a wash, and while he was at it his adopted child seated himself at the table and prepared to fall to.Hendon despatched his ablutions with alacrity, then drew back the other chair and was about to place himself at table, when the boy said, indignantly—"
"“等等！你居然敢在国王面前坐下来？”","“Forbear!Wouldst sit in the presence of the King?”"
"这两句话把亨登吓得跳了起来。他自言自语道：“瞧，这可怜孩子的疯病越来越厉害了！随着国家发生巨变而变化，他幻想自己成了国王！他那么高傲，我也必须由着他自大，没有别的办法。我得忠诚，否则他会把我送进伦敦塔去！”","This blow staggered Hendon to his foundations.He muttered to himself, “Lo, the poor thing’s madness is up with the time!It hath changed with the great change that is come to the realm, and now in fancy is he King!Good lack, I must humour the conceit, too—there is no other way—faith, he would order me to the Tower, else!”"
"他觉得这个俏皮话蛮有趣，就将椅子从桌旁挪开，站到了国王后面，毕恭毕敬地伺候他。","And pleased with this jest, he removed the chair from the table, took his stand behind the King, and proceeded to wait upon him in the courtliest way he was capable of."
"国王吃饭时，他那皇室的高贵态度放松了些，于是他心满意足地想要说话。他说：“如果我没有听错的话，我想你叫自己迈尔斯·亨登？”","While the King ate, the rigour of his royal dignity relaxed a little and with his growing contentment came a desire to talk.He said—“I think thou callest thyself Miles Hendon, if I heard thee aright?”"
"“是的，陛下。”迈尔斯回答，然后又自语道，“如果我要顺着这个可怜的家伙疯，我必须叫他‘陛下’，我必须叫他‘吾皇’，我不能半途而废，必须完全按照自己的角色表演。如果我演不好，也就做不好这件仁慈、好心的事情了。”","“Yes, Sire,” Miles replied; then observed to himself, “If I must humour the poor lad’s madness, I must ‘Sire’ him, I must ‘Majesty’ him, I must not go by halves, I must stick at nothing that belongeth to the part I play, else shall I play it ill and work evil to this charitable and kindly cause.”"
"国王又喝了一杯酒暖身子，说道：“我想知道你的情况，给我讲讲你的身世。你有种侠义的风度，很高贵——你是不是出身贵族？”","The King warmed his heart with a second glass of wine, and said—“I would know thee—tell me thy story.Thou hast a gallant way with thee, and a noble—art nobly born?”"
"“仁慈的陛下，我家是最低微的贵族。家父是准男爵，那是最低的骑士爵位。他叫理查德·亨登爵士，住在肯特郡修道士小岛旁的亨登庄园里。”","“We are of the tail of the nobility, good your Majesty.My father is a baronet—one of the smaller lords by knight service—Sir Richard Hendon of Hendon Hall, by Monk’s Holm in Kent.”"
"“这个名字，我记不起来了。继续讲你的故事。”","“The name has escaped my memory.Go on—tell me thy story.”"
"“其实也没什么，陛下，但是没什么更好的可以说了，这也许可以消遣半个钟头呢。我父亲理查德爵士很有钱，而且天性非常大方。我还很小的时候，我母亲就去世了。我有两个兄弟：哥哥名叫阿瑟，跟父亲一样为人正派；弟弟名叫休，心眼很坏，贪得无厌，叛逆不忠，品性不端，卑劣狡诈——他是一个卑鄙的人。他从出生起就是这样，十年之后还是一样。我最后一次见他时，他十九岁，是个十足的无赖。那时我二十岁，阿瑟二十二岁。除了我们几个，就是我的表妹伊迪丝小姐了。那时，她芳龄十六，美丽、温柔、善良，是伯爵家族的最后一个女儿，也是一大笔遗产和一个空头衔的继承人。我父亲是他的监护人。我们彼此相爱，但她从小就和阿瑟定了婚约，理查德爵士是不能容忍毁约的。阿瑟爱上了另外一个女孩，他要我们鼓足勇气，不放弃希望，拖延时间，相信总有一天，所有的事情都会幸运地迎刃而解。休喜欢伊迪丝小姐的财产，虽然他口口声声说喜欢的是她本人，但他总是这样心口不一。不过，他的把戏在这个女孩身上不灵。他骗得了父亲，却骗不了其他人。我们兄弟几个中，我父亲最爱的是他，也信任和相信他，因为他是最小的孩子，而且其他人都恨他——这就足以赢得任何时代的父母的最真挚的爱。他能花言巧语哄人，天生极会说谎——这些都大大助长了盲目的溺爱。我比较野，实际上我还能更进一步地说，我可以称得上放荡不羁。不过，那是一种天真的野性，因为它不会伤害到任何人，除了我自己，不会给任何人带来耻辱和损失，它也不和任何罪恶或卑鄙沾边，没有任何和我值得尊敬的身份不相符的东西。","“’Tis not much, your Majesty, yet perchance it may beguile a short half-hour for want of a better.My father, Sir Richard, is very rich, and of a most generous nature.My mother died whilst I was yet a boy.I have two brothers: Arthur, my elder, with a soul like to his father’s; and Hugh, younger than I, a mean spirit, covetous, treacherous, vicious, and underhanded—a reptile.Such was he from the cradle; such was he ten years past, when I last saw him—a ripe rascal at nineteen, I being twenty then, and Arthur twenty-two.There is none other of us but the Lady Edith, my cousin—she was sixteen then—beautiful, gentle, good, the daughter of an earl, the last of her race, heiress of a great fortune and a lapsed title.My father was her guardian.I loved her and she loved me; but she was betrothed to Arthur from the cradle, and Sir Richard would not suffer the contract to be broken.Arthur loved another maid, and bade us be of good cheer and hold fast to the hope that delay and luck together would some day give success to our several causes.Hugh loved the Lady Edith’s fortune, though in truth he said it was herself he loved—but then ’twas his way, alway, to say the one thing and mean the other.But he lost his arts upon the girl; he could deceive my father, but none else.My father loved him best of us all, and trusted and believed him; for he was the youngest child, and others hated him—these qualities being in all ages sufficient to win a parent’s dearest love; and he had a smooth persuasive tongue, with an admirable gift of lying—and these be qualities which do mightily assist a blind affection to cozen itself.I was wild—in troth I might go yet farther and say very wild, though ’twas a wildness of an innocent sort, since it hurt none but me, brought shame to none, nor loss, nor had in it any taint of crime or baseness, or what might not beseem mine honourable degree."
"“可是，我弟弟休充分利用了这些缺点。他见哥哥阿瑟身体不好，如果除掉我，他就扫除了自己利益的障碍，所以——不过说来话长，我的陛下，而且讲这些没什么用。那就简要地说吧，弟弟巧妙地把我的缺点夸大，把那说成了一种罪恶。他先是卑鄙地在我房里找到银梯子——那是他自己故意放在那里的，却把它作为证据。他还教唆仆人和其他满口谎言的流氓作证，让我父亲相信我不听他的话，而且正打算和伊迪丝私奔，和她结婚。”","“Yet did my brother Hugh turn these faults to good account—he seeing that our brother Arthur’s health was but indifferent, and hoping the worst might work him profit were I swept out of the path—so—but ’twere a long tale, good my liege, and little worth the telling.Briefly, then, this brother did deftly magnify my faults and make them crimes; ending his base work with finding a silken ladder in mine apartments—conveyed thither by his own means—and did convince my father by this, and suborned evidence of servants and other lying knaves, that I was minded to carry off my Edith and marry with her in rank defiance of his will.”"
"“我父亲说，把我从家和英国放逐三年，可以让我成为一个军人和真正的男人，还会增加我的智慧。漫长的放逐期间，我参加了大陆的战争，饱尝了艰苦、穷困和冒险。但在最后一场战役中，我被俘虏，在异国他乡的地牢里被关了七年，熬过了七年的月圆月缺。凭着智慧和勇气，我最终呼吸到了自由的空气，就一直逃到这里。我刚刚回来，钱袋空空，衣衫破旧，更不知道在这枯燥的七年里，亨登庄园、它的主人们和里面的东西发生了怎样的变化。启禀陛下，我无聊的故事讲完了。”","“Three years of banishment from home and England might make a soldier and a man of me, my father said, and teaches me some degree of wisdom.I fought out my long probation in the continental wars, tasting sumptuously of hard knocks, privation, and adventure; but in my last battle I was taken captive, and during the seven years that have waxed and waned since then, a foreign dungeon hath harboured me.Through wit and courage I won to the free air at last, and fled hither straight; and am but just arrived, right poor in purse and raiment, and poorer still in knowledge of what these dull seven years have wrought at Hendon Hall, its people and belongings.So please you, sir, my meagre tale is told.”"
"“你遭受了可耻的虐待！” 小国王眼里闪着光，说道，“不过，我会替你讨回公道的——我以十字架的名义保证！这是国王说的。”","“Thou hast been shamefully abused!” said the little King, with a flashing eye.“But I will right thee—by the cross will I!The King hath said it.”"
"接着，因为迈尔斯的不幸故事而激动不已的他，滔滔不绝地讲起了自己最近的不幸经历，令听的人惊讶万分。他讲完之后，迈尔斯自语道：","Then, fired by the story of Miles’s wrongs, he loosed his tongue and poured the history of his own recent misfortunes into the ears of his astonished listener.When he had finished, Miles said to himself—"
"“瞧，他还真有想象力啊！这实在不是一般人的脑袋，否则也不可能凭空编织出这么合情合理、有情有趣的奇怪而浪漫的故事来，不管他是不是真的疯了。可怜的得病的小脑袋，只要我活着，你就不会没有朋友或住所。他永远都不要离开我身边，他将是我宠爱的人，我的小伙伴。他的病会好的！唉，快好起来吧，然后他会闯出名气的那我会自豪地说：‘是的，他是我的。我收留了他这个无家可归、衣衫褴褛的小孩，但是我看到了他的潜质，我说他总有一天会扬名——瞧瞧他，看看他——我说对了吧？’”","“Lo, what an imagination he hath!Verily, this is no common mind; else, crazed or sane, it could not weave so straight and gaudy a tale as this out of the airy nothings wherewith it hath wrought this curious romaunt.Poor ruined little head, it shall not lack friend or shelter whilst I bide with the living.He shall never leave my side; he shall be my pet, my little comrade.And he shall be cured!—ay, made whole and sound—then will he make himself a name—and proud shall I be to say, ‘Yes, he is mine—I took him, a homeless little ragamuffin, but I saw what was in him, and I said his name would be heard some day—behold him, observe him—was I right?’”"
"国王开口，用若有所思、有板有眼的嗓音说：","The King spoke—in a thoughtful, measured voice—"
"“对，你的确把我从伤害和耻辱中救了出来，甚至救了我的命，也救了我的皇位。我应该好好地酬劳你一番。说说你想要什么，只要在我的皇权能力范围内，它就归你了。”","“Thou didst save me injury and shame, perchance my life, and so my crown.Such service demandeth rich reward.Name thy desire, and so it be within the compass of my royal power, it is thine.”"
"这荒谬的提议一下子让亨登从幻想中惊醒过来。他正要谢恩，说他只是尽了自己的责任，不求报答，这事就算作罢了。不过，他脑子里突然冒出一个更聪明的想法，他请求国王允许他安静一会儿，好考虑一下这慷慨的恩情。国王郑重地同意了，说这么重要的事情，最好不要着急。","This fantastic suggestion startled Hendon out of his reverie.He was about to thank the King and put the matter aside with saying he had only done his duty and desired no reward, but a wiser thought came into his head, and he asked leave to be silent a few moments and consider the gracious offer—an idea which the King gravely approved, remarking that it was best to be not too hasty with a thing of such great import."
"迈尔斯思索片刻，心想：“对，就这么办，没有其他方法可以做到。的确，这一个小时的经历告诉我，这样继续下去只会令人疲倦而不便。对，我要提出来，真庆幸我没有错过这次机会。”然后，他单腿跪下，说：","Miles reflected during some moments, then said to himself, “Yes, that is the thing to do—by any other means it were impossible to get at it—and certes, this hour’s experience has taught me ’twould be most wearing and inconvenient to continue it as it is.Yes, I will propose it; ’twas a happy accident that I did not throw the chance away.”Then he dropped upon one knee and said—"
"“我所尽的绵薄之力也不过是臣子的职责，所以算不上什么功劳。但是，既然陛下您愿意为此奖赏，为此我斗胆请愿。正如陛下所知，大约四百年前，英国国王约翰与法国国王起了争执，于是颁布法令让两个战士在竞技场决斗，通过所谓的上帝裁判来解决争端。这两位国王还有西班牙国王聚到一起观看并裁决这场决斗。法国的战士出场了，但是他实在令人生畏，我们英国的骑士们拒绝跟他交手。这件事情是很严重的，是违抗英国君主的命令。英国最强大的武士德库西伯爵被关在了伦敦塔里，被剥夺了头衔和财产，长久地在牢狱里消磨时日。国王给了他赎罪的机会，他同意了，便全副武装前来决斗。而法国人一瞥到他的大块头，听闻他的大名，就逃之夭夭了。于是，法国国王这一仗打败了。国王约翰恢复了德库西的头衔，归还了他的财产，说道：‘说出你的愿望，我会满足你，即便要我付出我的半壁江山。’德库西随即下跪，像我现在一样，回答道：‘那我的陛下，我请求您，只要王国还在，我和我的后人就拥有在英国国王面前不摘帽子的特权。’陛下您知道，这个要求得到了恩准。后来的四百年里，所有的皇位继承人都遵守了这个承诺。所以，甚至到了今天，那座古老的房子的首领仍然在国王陛下面前戴着帽子或头盔，而其他人是不允许这样的。说这个先例是为了我的请求，我恳请国王只恩准我一个特权，这样的酬劳就足够了。我的要求不是别的，那就是，我和我的子嗣，永远能够在英国国王面前坐下。","“My poor service went not beyond the limit of a subject’s simple duty, and therefore hath no merit; but since your Majesty is pleased to hold it worthy some reward, I take heart of grace to make petition to this effect.Near four hundred years ago, as your grace knoweth, there being ill blood betwixt John, King of England, and the King of France, it was decreed that two champions should fight together in the lists, and so settle the dispute by what is called the arbitrament of God.These two kings, and the Spanish king, being assembled to witness and judge the conflict, the French champion appeared; but so redoubtable was he that our English knights refused to measure weapons with him.So the matter, which was a weighty one, was like to go against the English monarch by default.Now in the Tower lay the Lord de Courcy, the mightiest arm in England, stripped of his honours and possessions, and wasting with long captivity.Appeal was made to him; he gave assent, and came forth arrayed for battle; but no sooner did the Frenchman glimpse his huge frame and hear his famous name but he fled away, and the French king’s cause was lost.King John restored De Courcy’s titles and possessions, and said, ‘Name thy wish and thou shalt have it, though it cost me half my kingdom;’ whereat De Courcy, kneeling, as I do now, made answer, ‘This, then, I ask, my liege; that I and my successors may have and hold the privilege of remaining covered in the presence of the kings of England, henceforth while the throne shall last.’The boon was granted, as your Majesty knoweth; and there hath been no time, these four hundred years, that that line has failed of an heir; and so, even unto this day, the head of that ancient house still weareth his hat or helm before the King’s Majesty, without let or hindrance, and this none other may do.Invoking this precedent in aid of my prayer, I beseech the King to grant to me but this one grace and privilege—to my more than sufficient reward—and none other, to wit: that I and my heirs, for ever, may sit in the presence of the Majesty of England!”"
"“起来，骑士迈尔斯·亨登爵士，”国王郑重地说着，用亨登的剑授予他这一荣誉，“起来，坐下。你的请求已得到应允。只要英国还在，皇位仍存，你的特权就不会撤销。”","“Rise, Sir Miles Hendon, Knight,” said the King, gravely—giving the accolade with Hendon’s sword—“rise, and seat thyself.Thy petition is granted.Whilst England remains and the crown continues, the privilege shall not lapse.”"
"陛下沉思着走开了，亨登在桌旁的椅子上坐下来暗自心想：“这真是个好主意，能够彻底解救我。我双腿已经疲劳不堪。如果不是想到这个主意，我就必须要站上几个星期，直到这可怜的家伙的疯病治愈。”过了会儿，他接着想：“这么说，我成了梦影王国的骑士！对我这样一个务实的人来说，这真是个非常离奇古怪的职位。我不能笑——不能，上帝不允许，因为这件事对于我是虚幻的，而对他却是真实的。而且对我来说，在某种意义上，这也不是虚假的，因为这确实反映了他身上那种亲切大方的精神。”沉默片刻之后，他又想：“啊，如果他在别人面前叫我的头衔，怎么办？我的荣誉和我的衣服太不相称了！不过没关系，他高兴叫我什么都行，我没有不满意的。”","His Majesty walked apart, musing, and Hendon dropped into a chair at table, observing to himself, “’Twas a brave thought, and hath wrought me a mighty deliverance; my legs are grievously wearied.An I had not thought of that, I must have had to stand for weeks, till my poor lad’s wits are cured.”After a little, he went on, “And so I am become a knight of the Kingdom of Dreams and Shadows!A most odd and strange position, truly, for one so matter-of-fact as I.I will not laugh—no, God forbid, for this thing which is so substanceless to me is real to him.And to me, also, in one way, it is not a falsity, for it reflects with truth the sweet and generous spirit that is in him.”After a pause: “Ah, what if he should call me by my fine title before folk!—there’d be a merry contrast betwixt my glory and my raiment!But no matter, let him call me what he will, so it please him; I shall be content.”"
"第十三章 王子失踪","Chapter XIII  The Disappearance of the Prince"
"不一会儿，二人都睡意渐浓。国王说道：","A heavy drowsiness presently fell upon the two comrades.The King said—"
"“给我脱掉这些破布。”他指的是他的衣服。","“Remove these rags.”—meaning his clothing."
"亨登没反对，也没说话，就帮男孩脱了衣服，把他抱到床上，然后在屋里扫视了一下，悲伤地自言自语：“他又睡了我的床，像刚才一样——啊，我怎么办呢？”小国王注意到了他的困惑，于是说了一句话指点他。他睡意朦胧地说道：","Hendon disapparelled the boy without dissent or remark, tucked him up in bed, then glanced about the room, saying to him, ruefully, “He hath taken my bed again, as before—marry, what – I – shall do?”The little King observed his perplexity, and dissipated it with a word.He said, sleepily—"
"“你就睡在门口，看着门。”他很快就沉入了梦乡，摆脱了困扰。","“Thou wilt sleep athwart the door, and guard it.”In a moment more he was out of his troubles, in a deep slumber."
"“亲爱的宝贝，他真是生来就该当国王的！”亨登钦佩地咕哝道，“他扮演国王像极了。”","“Dear heart, he should have been born a king!” muttered Hendon, admiringly; “he playeth the part to a marvel.”"
"然后，他横躺在门前的地板上，心满意足地说：","Then he stretched himself across the door, on the floor, saying contentedly—"
"“我在更惨的地方住了七年，但睡在上面的他感到不适，也算不上不知感激。”","“I have lodged worse for seven years; ’twould be but ill gratitude to Him above to find fault with this.”"
"天快亮的时候，他才睡着了。快到中午时他才起来，他掀开正睡觉的被守护者的被子。他每次只掀起一部分，用一根绳子量它的长度。刚刚量完，国王就醒了，抱怨很冷，问他做什么呢。","He dropped asleep as the dawn appeared.Toward noon he rose, uncovered his unconscious ward—a section at a time—and took his measure with a string.The King awoke, just as he had completed his work, complained of the cold, and asked what he was doing."
"“现在做完了，我的陛下，”亨登说，“我出去办点事，不过很快就回来。您接着睡吧，您需要睡觉。好了，我帮您把头也盖上，这样您很快就会暖和起来。”","“’Tis done, now, my liege,” said Hendon; “I have a bit of business outside, but will presently returned; sleep thou again—thou needest it.There—let me cover thy head also—thou’lt be warm the sooner.”"
"亨登话没说完，国王又坠入了梦乡。迈尔斯悄悄溜出去，三四十分钟后，又悄悄地回来了，拿着一件完整的二手男孩衣服。衣服的料子很廉价，有穿过的痕迹，但是很整洁，而且适合这个季节穿。他坐下来，开始仔细检查他买的东西，喃喃自语：","The King was back in dreamland before this speech was ended.Miles slipped softly out, and slipped as softly in again, in the course of thirty or forty minutes, with a complete second-hand suit of boy’s clothing, of cheap material, and showing signs of wear; but tidy, and suited to the season of the year.He seated himself, and began to overhaul his purchase, mumbling to himself—"
"“如果有更多的钱就可以买件更好的，但是如果没有那么多钱，就应该对很少的钱买来的东西感到满意。","“A longer purse would have got a better sort, but when one has not the long purse one must be content with what a short one may do—"
"“‘我们镇上有一个妇女，我们镇上的确住着——’","“‘There was a woman in our town, In our town did dwell—’"
"“看来他翻身了，我得小声点唱，打搅他睡觉可不好。他走了那么多路，已经筋疲力尽了，可怜的家伙……这件衣服——已经够好了。在这儿缝一针，那儿缝一针，就可以穿了。那一件更好些，不过也要缝一两针……这双鞋很好，没破，可以让他的小脚丫暖和、干燥。也许这对他来说是件新奇的东西，因为他一定习惯了冬夏都光着脚走路……如果针线是面包，那么人们花一法寻就可以买够吃一年的食物，而且这样一根勇敢的大针不用花钱，完全是因为爱。我到底有没有那鬼时间来缝呢？”","“He stirred, methinks—I must sing in a less thunderous key; ’tis not good to mar his sleep, with this journey before him, and he so wearied out, poor chap...This garment—’tis well enough—a stitch here and another one there will set it aright.This other is better, albeit a stitch or two will not come amiss in it, likewise...These be very good and sound, and will keep his small feet warm and dry—an odd new thing to him, belike, since he has doubtless been used to foot it bare, winters and summers the same...Would thread were bread, seeing one getteth a year’s sufficiency for a farthing, and such a brave big needle without cost, for mere love.Now shall I have the demon’s own time to thread it?”"
"他有时间。他开始缝，所有男人都是像这样缝的，而且可能将永远这么缝，直到世界末日——他稳稳地拿着针，费劲地将线穿进针眼，跟女人的方式是完全相反的。穿了几次，线都没穿过针眼，不是穿到针的这一边，就是穿到针的那一边，要不就在针孔那儿分叉。不过，他挺有耐心，从前在军队中时，他曾有过这样的经历。他终于成功了，便拿起躺在那儿等着的衣服，放在大腿上，然后开始他的工作。","And so he had.He did as men have always done, and probably always will do, to the end of time—held the needle still, and tried to thrust the thread through the eye, which is the opposite of a woman’s way.Time and time again the thread missed the mark, going sometimes on one side of the needle, sometimes on the other, sometimes doubling up against the shaft; but he was patient, having been through these experiences before, when he was soldiering.He succeeded at last, and took up the garment that had lain waiting, meantime, across his lap, and began his work."
"“旅馆已经付了钱，包括之后的早餐。剩下的钱足够买两头驴，并支撑这两三天的开销，到了亨登庄园就衣食无忧了。","“The inn is paid—the breakfast that is to come, included—and there is wherewithal left to buy a couple of donkeys and meet our little costs for the two or three days betwixt this and the plenty that awaits us at Hendon Hall—"
"“‘她爱她的丈——’","“‘She loved her hus—’"
"“天啊！我把针刺到指甲里去了！……没关系——这不稀奇，可也不是什么好事……到了那儿我们会很高兴的，小家伙，这是毫无疑问的！在那儿，你的烦恼会消失，你悲伤的情绪也是一样。","“Body o’ me!I have driven the needle under my nail! …It matters little—’tis not a novelty—yet ’tis not a convenience, neither....We shall be merry there, little one, never doubt it!Thy troubles will vanish there, and likewise thy sad distemper—"
"“‘她爱她亲爱的丈夫，但是另一个男人——’","“‘She loved her husband dearilee, But another man—’"
"“这真是壮观的大针脚！”他将衣服举起来，赞叹地审视了一番：“它们有种壮丽、宏大的味道，跟这一比，裁缝的小针脚真是显得又小气又俗气。","“These be noble large stitches!”—holding the garment up and viewing it admiringly—“they have a grandeur and a majesty that do cause these small stingy ones of the tailor-man to look mightily paltry and plebeian—"
"“‘她爱她亲爱的丈夫，可另一个男人爱她——’","“‘She loved her husband dearilee, But another man he loved she,—’"
"“哎呀，大功告成——这件的手艺也不错，迅速完工。我现在要叫醒他，给他穿上衣服，为他倒水，请他吃饭，然后我们要快点走到萨瑟克的塔巴德小酒馆旁边的集市去——请起床，我的陛下！他没有答应，怎么了，我的陛下！我真的要不敬地拍拍神圣的他，因为他睡着时是听不到我说话的。什么！”","“Marry, ’tis done—a goodly piece of work, too, and wrought with expedition.Now will I wake him, apparel him, pour for him, feed him, and then will we hie us to the mart by the Tabard Inn in Southwark and—be pleased to rise, my liege!—he answereth not—what ho, my liege!—of a truth must I profane his sacred person with a touch, sith his slumber is deaf to speech.What!”"
"他掀开被子——男孩不见了！","He threw back the covers—the boy was gone!"
"好一会儿，他惊得说不出话，凝视着四周。他才发现他守护的人的破衣服也不见了。他勃然大怒地喊旅店老板。这时，一个侍者端着早餐进来了。","He stared about him in speechless astonishment for a moment; noticed for the first time that his ward’s ragged raiment was also missing; then he began to rage and storm and shout for the innkeeper.At that moment a servant entered with the breakfast."
"“说清楚，你这个撒旦的狗腿子，不然你的死期就到了！”这名战士凶猛地朝侍者跃过去。侍者又惊又怕，一时间说不出话来。他怒吼道：“男孩哪儿去了？”","“Explain, thou limb of Satan, or thy time is come!”roared the man of war, and made so savage a spring toward the waiter that this latter could not find his tongue, for the instant, for fright and surprise.“Where is the boy?”"
"战战兢兢的男侍语无伦次地回答他：","In disjointed and trembling syllables the man gave the information desired."
"“阁下，您刚刚出去，就跑来了个年轻人，说是阁下您派人来接这个男孩子的，要带去萨瑟克桥头。我带他进来，他把小家伙叫醒，说了句什么，小家伙的确嘟囔着抱怨吵醒，还说了声‘这么早’。但他还是立刻就裹上他那破衣服，跟那年轻人走了，只说照礼节阁下您应该亲自来才对，不该派了个陌生人，所以——”","“You were hardly gone from the place, your worship, when a youth came running and said it was your worship’s will that the boy come to you straight, at the bridge-end on the Southwark side.I brought him hither; and when he woke the lad and gave his message, the lad did grumble some little for being disturbed ‘so early,’ as he called it, but straightway trussed on his rags and went with the youth, only saying it had been better manners that your worship came yourself, not sent a stranger—and so—”"
"“你真是个蠢蛋！容易上当的蠢蛋，见鬼去吧！但愿他没有受到伤害。也许那人并不想伤害这个男孩。我要去把他找回来。摆好桌子。等等！床铺摆得好像有人躺在下面一样，这是偶然吗？”","“And so thou’rt a fool!—a fool and easily cozened—hang all thy breed!Yet mayhap no hurt is done.Possibly no harm is meant the boy.I will go fetch him.Make the table ready.Stay!The coverings of the bed were disposed as if one lay beneath them—happened that by accident?”"
"“我不知道，仁慈的阁下。我看见那年轻人摆弄床铺，就是来找男孩的那个人。”","“I know not, good your worship.I saw the youth meddle with them—he that came for the boy.”"
"“该千刀万剐的！这是想骗我，明显就是要争取时间。你听着！那个年轻人是一个人来的吗？”","“Thousand deaths!’Twas done to deceive me—’tis plain ’twas done to gain time.Hark ye!Was that youth alone?”"
"“就他自己，阁下。”","“All alone, your worship.”"
"“确定？”“确定，阁下。”“理理你那混乱的思维。你好好想想，别着急，哥们。”","“Art sure?”“Sure, your worship.”“Collect thy scattered wits—bethink thee—take time, man.”"
"侍者思索片刻后，说道：","After a moment’s thought, the servant said—"
"“他来的时候，没有人和他一起，但我现在记起来了，他们俩走到伦敦桥的人群中时，一个恶棍长相的男人从一旁闯过来。他正要跟他俩会合时——”","“When he came, none came with him; but now I remember me that as the two stepped into the throng of the Bridge, a ruffian-looking man plunged out from some near place; and just as he was joining them—”"
"“接着怎么样？说啊！”不耐烦的亨登插嘴大喊道。","“What then?—out with it!” thundered the impatient Hendon, interrupting."
"“正在这时，人群涌过来，将他们淹没了，我就没再看到什么。当时我的主人叫我了，他正因为忘记送放高利贷的人点的大烤肉这事生气呢，但所有目击的圣人都可以为我作证。把这个错赖到我身上，就像给没出生的婴儿定罪——”","“Just then the crowd lapped them up and closed them in, and I saw no more, being called by my master, who was in a rage because a joint that the scrivener had ordered was forgot, though I take all the saints to witness that to blame ME for that miscarriage were like holding the unborn babe to judgment for sins com—”"
"“滚开，蠢货！你唠唠叨叨的，快把我逼疯了！站住！你急着往哪儿去？你就不能好好再呆会儿？他们朝萨瑟克去了吗？","“Out of my sight, idiot!Thy prating drives me mad!Hold!Whither art flying?Canst not bide still an instant?Went they toward Southwark?”"
"“即便这样，阁下，像我刚才说的，都因为那可恶的大烤肉，我比刚出生的婴儿都要无辜——”","“Even so, your worship—for, as I said before, as to that detestable joint, the babe unborn is no whit more blameless than—”"
"“没完没了！还在唠叨！滚，免得我勒死你！”侍者消失了。亨登紧随其后，超过他，一步两个台阶地冲下楼梯，嘴里嘟囔着：“是那个声称他是他儿子的卑鄙的恶棍。我把你弄丢了，我可怜的小疯主人，想起来实在令人心痛，我已经那么喜欢你了！不！看在圣经和圣钟的份上，我不会把你丢了！不会丢的，因为我会搜遍每一寸土地，一直到找到你为止。可怜的孩子，那是他的早餐，还有我的，可我现在没胃口。那么，给耗子吃了吧——快，快！就是要快！”他左拐右绕，迅速穿梭在伦敦桥上喧闹的人群里，一遍又一遍地对自己说，似乎这个想法能让他愉快，就一直抓着不放：“他抱怨，但是他跟去了。他跟去了，是的，因为他以为迈尔斯·亨登叫他去的。可爱的家伙，否则他不会去的，我就知道。”","“Art here yet!And prating still!Vanish, lest I throttle thee!”The servitor vanished.Hendon followed after him, passed him, and plunged down the stairs two steps at a stride, muttering, “’Tis that scurvy villain that claimed he was his son.I have lost thee, my poor little mad master—it is a bitter thought—and I had come to love thee so!No!By book and bell, NOT lost!Not lost, for I will ransack the land till I find thee again.Poor child, yonder is his breakfast—and mine, but I have no hunger now; so, let the rats have it—speed, speed!That is the word!”As he wormed his swift way through the noisy multitudes upon the Bridge he several times said to himself—clinging to the thought as if it were a particularly pleasing one—“He grumbled, but he went—he went, yes, because he thought Miles Hendon asked it, sweet lad—he would ne’er have done it for another, I know it well.”"
"第十四章 “国王驾崩——国王万岁！”","Chapter XIV  ‘Le Roi est Mort—Vive le Roi.’"
"同一天，天刚刚放亮时，汤姆·坎蒂从沉睡中醒来，在黑暗中睁开双眼。他静静地躺了几分钟，使劲整理他纷乱的思绪和记忆，试图找出个头绪。他突然用兴高采烈而又有所保留的嗓音喊道：","Toward daylight of the same morning, Tom Canty stirred out of a heavy sleep and opened his eyes in the dark.He lay silent a few moments, trying to analyse his confused thoughts and impressions, and get some sort of meaning out of them; then suddenly he burst out in a rapturous but guarded voice—"
"“我都看见了，我都看见了！感谢上帝，我终于还是醒了！来吧，高兴！消失吧，悲伤！……啊，娜恩！贝特！","“I see it all, I see it all!Now God be thanked, I am indeed awake at last!Come, joy!Vanish, sorrow!Ho, Nan!Bet!"
"踢开你们的干草，快到我这边来，让我给你们讲最荒诞不经的梦，这是夜的精灵制造出来吓人的灵魂，你们的耳朵绝不会相信！……啊，娜恩，我说！贝特！”一个模糊的人影出现在他身旁，一个声音说道：","kick off your straw and hie ye hither to my side, till I do pour into your unbelieving ears the wildest madcap dream that ever the spirits of night did conjure up to astonish the soul of man withal! ...Ho, Nan, I say!Bet!”A dim form appeared at his side, and a voice said—"
"“陛下您有什么命令？”","“Wilt deign to deliver thy commands?”"
"“命令？……噢，可怜的我啊，我听得出你的声音！你说，我是谁？”","“Commands? ...O, woe is me, I know thy voice!Speak thou—who am I?”"
"“您？说实话，昨天晚上您是威尔士王子，今天您是我最宽容的陛下，英格兰国王爱德华。”汤姆把脑袋埋进枕头里，伤心地嘟囔道：","“Thou?In sooth, yesternight wert thou the Prince of Wales; to-day art thou my most gracious liege, Edward, King of England.”Tom buried his head among his pillows, murmuring plaintively—"
"“天啊，不是在做梦！你下去吧，亲爱的先生，让我一个人悲伤。”","“Alack, it was no dream!Go to thy rest, sweet sir—leave me to my sorrows.”"
"汤姆又睡着了，不一会儿，做了这个甜美的梦。他梦见，夏天，他一个人在叫做“好人田”的美丽的牧场上玩耍，这时，一个只有一英尺高的小矮人突然出现在他面前。小矮人留着长长的红胡须，驼着背，说道：“在那个树桩旁挖掘。”他照做了，找到了十二个闪亮的新便士，真是奇妙的财富啊！而这还不是最好的部分，因为小矮人说道：","Tom slept again, and after a time he had this pleasant dream.He thought it was summer, and he was playing, all alone, in the fair meadow called Goodman’s Fields, when a dwarf only a foot high, with long red whiskers and a humped back, appeared to him suddenly and said, “Dig by that stump.”He did so, and found twelve bright new pennies—wonderful riches!Yet this was not the best of it; for the dwarf said—"
"“我认识你。你是个好孩子，应该得到奖励。你将不再苦恼，因为回报你的一天来了。每七天在这儿挖一次，你总会找到同样的财宝，十二个闪闪发光的新便士。别跟任何人讲，保守这个秘密。”","“I know thee.Thou art a good lad, and a deserving; thy distresses shall end, for the day of thy reward is come.Dig here every seventh day and thou shalt find always the same treasure, twelve bright new pennies.Tell none—keep the secret.”"
"然后，小矮人不见了。汤姆拿着奖品跑回垃圾大院，心想：“我每天晚上给我父亲一便士，他会以为是我讨来的，他一高兴，就不会再打我了。每星期给教我的好心神父一便士，另外四便士给母亲、娜恩和贝特。现在，我们再也不会挨饿，不穿破烂衣服，再也不害怕，不悲伤，没有野蛮的虐待。”","Then the dwarf vanished, and Tom flew to Offal Court with his prize, saying to himself, “Every night will I give my father a penny; he will think I begged it, it will glad his heart, and I shall no more be beaten.One penny every week the good priest that teacheth me shall have; mother, Nan, and Bet the other four.We be done with hunger and rags, now, done with fears and frets and savage usage.”"
"在梦里，他气喘吁吁地回到了自己脏兮兮的家，可眼睛里跳跃着感激的热情。他将四便士掷到母亲的膝上，大声说道：","In his dream he reached his sordid home all out of breath, but with eyes dancing with grateful enthusiasm; cast four of his pennies into his mother’s lap and cried out—"
"“这些是给您的！这些都是，每个都是您的！给您、娜恩和贝特的。这都是正当得来的，不是讨的，也不是偷的！”","“They are for thee!—all of them, every one!—for thee and Nan and Bet—and honestly come by, not begged nor stolen!”"
"又惊又喜的母亲将他紧紧搂入怀中，大声说道：","The happy and astonished mother strained him to her breast and exclaimed—"
"“已经不早了，陛下可以起床了吗？”","“It waxeth late—may it please your Majesty to rise?”"
"啊！这不是他期待的回答。梦破碎了，他醒了。","Ah!That was not the answer he was expecting.The dream had snapped asunder—he was awake."
"他睁开双眼，衣着华丽的第一侍寝官正跪在他的床旁边。骗人的梦所带来的快乐逐渐消失，可怜的男孩意识到他依旧是俘虏，是国王。屋里满是穿着紫色斗篷的朝臣——紫色是服丧的颜色，另外还有君主的贵族仆人。汤姆从床上坐起来，透过厚重的丝绸帘幕凝视这些人。","He opened his eyes—the richly clad First Lord of the Bedchamber was kneeling by his couch.The gladness of the lying dream faded away—the poor boy recognised that he was still a captive and a king.The room was filled with courtiers clothed in purple mantles—the mourning colour—and with noble servants of the monarch.Tom sat up in bed and gazed out from the heavy silken curtains upon this fine company."
"穿衣服的繁琐过程开始了。这期间，一个接着一个的朝臣跪下行了礼，并为小国王失去亲人表示吊慰。开始，首席侍从武官拿起一件衬衫递给第一猎犬勋爵，勋爵将它递给第二侍寝官，第二侍寝官又将它递给了温莎森林第一护林官，护林官又将它递给了第三圣衣侍从官，第三圣衣侍从官又将它递给了兰开斯特公爵领地的皇家大臣，皇家大臣又将它递给了服装主管，服装主管又将它递给了纹章院长第三纹章官，第三纹章官又将它递给了伦敦塔的警官，警官又将它递给了家务主管，家务主管又将它递给了世袭的大餐巾官，大餐巾官又将它递给了英国高级海军大臣，海军大臣又将它递给了坎特伯雷大主教，最后传到了第一侍寝官手上。第一侍寝官拿了衣服，给汤姆穿上。可怜的小家伙满腹疑惑，这让他想起了救火时传递的水桶。","The weighty business of dressing began, and one courtier after another knelt and paid his court and offered to the little King his condolences upon his heavy loss, whilst the dressing proceeded.In the beginning, a shirt was taken up by the Chief Equerry in Waiting, who passed it to the First Lord of the Buckhounds, who passed it to the Second Gentleman of the Bedchamber, who passed it to the Head Ranger of Windsor Forest, who passed it to the Third Groom of the Stole, who passed it to the Chancellor Royal of the Duchy of Lancaster, who passed it to the Master of the Wardrobe, who passed it to Norroy King-at-Arms, who passed it to the Constable of the Tower, who passed it to the Chief Steward of the Household, who passed it to the Hereditary Grand Diaperer, who passed it to the Lord High Admiral of England, who passed it to the Archbishop of Canterbury, who passed it to the First Lord of the Bedchamber, who took what was left of it and put it on Tom.Poor little wondering chap, it reminded him of passing buckets at a fire."
"每件衣服都要依次经过这缓慢而庄严的过程。后来，汤姆对这个礼仪变得非常不耐烦，以至于当他终于看到丝制长筒袜开始经过这个传递过程时，他几乎感激涕零，因为他知道这就要结束了。不过，他高兴得太早了。第一侍寝官接过长筒袜，正欲套在汤姆的腿上，突然脸色变红，连忙将长筒袜推回给坎特伯雷大主教，表情十分诧异地悄声说道：“看，我的先生！”随即指着与长筒袜相连的什么东西。大主教的脸变得苍白，接着发红，将长筒袜递给高级海军将领，悄声说：“看，我的先生！”海军大臣将长筒袜递给世袭大餐巾官，几乎没喘口气就喊了出来：“看，我的先生！”长筒袜沿着这条线路往回漂移，经过家务主管、伦敦塔警官、纹章院长第三纹章官、衣服主管、兰开斯特公爵领地皇家大臣、第三圣衣侍从官、温莎森林护林官、第二侍寝官、第一猎犬勋爵，而且总是伴着一句又惊又怕的话：“看！看！”——直到最后长筒袜传到了侍从武官手里，他凝视了那导致这场惊慌的长筒袜一小会儿，脸色苍白，然后嘶哑地悄声说：“我的天，连接处破了一点！把国王长筒袜官送进伦敦塔！”然后他靠在第一猎犬勋爵的肩膀上缓了口气。而此时，有人正把新的、丝毫未损的长筒袜送过来。","Each garment in its turn had to go through this slow and solemn process; consequently Tom grew very weary of the ceremony; so weary that he felt an almost gushing gratefulness when he at last saw his long silken hose begin the journey down the line and knew that the end of the matter was drawing near.But he exulted too soon.The First Lord of the Bedchamber received the hose and was about to encase Tom’s legs in them, when a sudden flush invaded his face and he hurriedly hustled the things back into the hands of the Archbishop of Canterbury with an astounded look and a whispered, “See, my lord!” pointing to a something connected with the hose.The Archbishop paled, then flushed, and passed the hose to the Lord High Admiral, whispering, “See, my lord!”The Admiral passed the hose to the Hereditary Grand Diaperer, and had hardly breath enough in his body to ejaculate, “See, my lord!”The hose drifted backward along the line, to the Chief Steward of the Household, the Constable of the Tower, Norroy King-at-Arms, the Master of the Wardrobe, the Chancellor Royal of the Duchy of Lancaster, the Third Groom of the Stole, the Head Ranger of Windsor Forest, the Second Gentleman of the Bedchamber, the First Lord of the Buckhounds,—accompanied always with that amazed and frightened “See! see!”—till they finally reached the hands of the Chief Equerry in Waiting, who gazed a moment, with a pallid face, upon what had caused all this dismay, then hoarsely whispered, “Body of my life, a tag gone from a truss-point!—to the Tower with the Head Keeper of the King’s Hose!”—after which he leaned upon the shoulder of the First Lord of the Buckhounds to regather his vanished strength whilst fresh hose, without any damaged strings to them, were brought."
"不过，所有的事情都有个结束。最终，汤姆·坎蒂终于可以起床了。一个特定的官员倒了水，一个特定的官员帮他洗漱，另一个特定的官员手拿毛巾站在一旁。汤姆一步步安稳无事地通过了净化阶段，准备接受皇家理发师的服务了。最后，经过这位大师的修理，汤姆焕然一新，露出了他清秀的面容，漂亮得像个女孩子。他穿的是紫缎的斗篷和宽松短罩裤，戴的是饰有紫羽毛的帽子。这会儿，他隆重地穿过恭敬有礼的人群，走到他的早餐室。他经过之时，这些人都向后退，给他让路，并双膝跪拜。","But all things must have an end, and so in time Tom Canty was in a condition to get out of bed.The proper official poured water, the proper official engineered the washing, the proper official stood by with a towel, and by-and-by Tom got safely through the purifying stage and was ready for the services of the Hairdresser-royal.When he at length emerged from this master’s hands, he was a gracious figure and as pretty as a girl, in his mantle and trunks of purple satin, and purple-plumed cap.He now moved in state toward his breakfast-room, through the midst of the courtly assemblage; and as he passed, these fell back, leaving his way free, and dropped upon their knees."
"吃罢早饭，他的重要朝臣们和五十个拿着镀金战斧的守卫伴随着他，庄重地将他引至御座室，他将在那里处理国家大事。他的“舅舅”赫特福德伯爵站在御座一旁，辅助国王，为国王献计献策。","After breakfast he was conducted, with regal ceremony, attended by his great officers and his guard of fifty Gentlemen Pensioners bearing gilt battle-axes, to the throne-room, where he proceeded to transact business of state.His ‘uncle,’ Lord Hertford, took his stand by the throne, to assist the royal mind with wise counsel."
"老国王托付的遗嘱执行人出现了，是几位出色的大臣。他们请求汤姆允许他们做一些事，算得上是一个仪式，又不完全是一个仪式，因为还没有保护人。坎特伯雷大主教宣读遗嘱执行委员会关于那位驾崩的、最伟大的国王的葬礼的法令。最后读的是遗嘱执行人的签名，包括坎特伯雷大主教、英国议院院长、威廉·圣约翰勋爵、约翰·拉塞尔勋爵、爱德华·赫特福德伯爵、约翰·莱尔子爵、达勒姆的卡思伯特主教。","The body of illustrious men named by the late King as his executors appeared, to ask Tom’s approval of certain acts of theirs—rather a form, and yet not wholly a form, since there was no Protector as yet.The Archbishop of Canterbury made report of the decree of the Council of Executors concerning the obsequies of his late most illustrious Majesty, and finished by reading the signatures of the Executors, to wit: the Archbishop of Canterbury; the Lord Chancellor of England; William Lord St. John; John Lord Russell; Edward Earl of Hertford; John Viscount Lisle; Cuthbert Bishop of Durham—"
"汤姆没有听，他在为文件之前的一句话而困惑。这时，他转向赫特福德伯爵，悄声说：","Tom was not listening—an earlier clause of the document was puzzling him.At this point he turned and whispered to Lord Hertford—"
"“他说葬礼指定日期是哪天？”","“What day did he say the burial hath been appointed for?”"
"“下个月的十六日，陛下。”","“The sixteenth of the coming month, my liege.”"
"“真是奇怪的做法。他能保存吗？”","“’Tis a strange folly.Will he keep?”"
"可怜的小家伙，他还不熟悉皇家的习俗。他看惯了垃圾大院里凄惨的死人被迅速地拖走，那很不一样。不过，赫特福德伯爵一两句话就解除了他这个忧虑。","Poor chap, he was still new to the customs of royalty; he was used to seeing the forlorn dead of Offal Court hustled out of the way with a very different sort of expedition.However, the Lord Hertford set his mind at rest with a word or two."
"国务卿呈上一份文书，上面写着国会定于明天十一点会见外国使节，请求国王批准。","A secretary of state presented an order of the Council appointing the morrow at eleven for the reception of the foreign ambassadors, and desired the King’s assent."
"汤姆用询问的眼神望着赫特福德，后者耳语道：","Tom turned an inquiring look toward Hertford, who whispered—"
"“陛下将表示同意。他们是代表他们的皇家主人来安慰陛下的，因为陛下和大英王国遭受了巨大的损失。”","“Your Majesty will signify consent.They come to testify their royal masters’ sense of the heavy calamity which hath visited your Grace and the realm of England.”"
"汤姆照做了。另一位大臣开始宣读一篇序文，关于驾崩的国王的家用花销，过去六个月一共是两万八千英镑。这么大数目令汤姆倒吸了一口气。当他得知实际上还有两万的债务未付时，他又倒吸了一口气。当提及国王的金库差不多被掏空，他的一千二百个侍从得不到应得的工资，因而十分窘迫时，他又倒吸了口气。汤姆忧心忡忡，开口说道：","Tom did as he was bidden.Another secretary began to read a preamble concerning the expenses of the late King’s household, which had amounted to 28,000 pounds during the preceding six months—a sum so vast that it made Tom Canty gasp;he gasped again when the fact appeared that 20,000 pounds of this money was still owing and unpaid; and once more when it appeared that the King’s coffers were about empty, and his twelve hundred servants much embarrassed for lack of the wages due them.Tom spoke out, with lively apprehension—"
"“我们要破产了，这是显然的。我们应该、也需要缩减家用，遣散些仆人。他们之前也没什么用，只会耽误时间，担任使精神困扰、使灵魂蒙羞的职务，令人烦恼。他们什么都做不了，不过就是玩偶，既没脑子，手又不勤快。我记得那个鱼市对面的小家庭，比灵斯门旁边——”","“We be going to the dogs, ’tis plain.’Tis meet and necessary that we take a smaller house and set the servants at large, sith they be of no value but to make delay, and trouble one with offices that harass the spirit and shame the soul, they misbecoming any but a doll, that hath nor brains nor hands to help itself withal.I remember me of a small house that standeth over against the fish-market, by Billingsgate—”"
"有人使劲捏了捏汤姆的胳膊，让他停止说蠢话，汤姆红了脸。不过，没有任何人显出对汤姆奇怪的言语的任何关注。","A sharp pressure upon Tom’s arm stopped his foolish tongue and sent a blush to his face; but no countenance there betrayed any sign that this strange speech had been remarked or given concern."
"一位大臣宣布，依照国王遗嘱，授予赫特福德伯爵公爵爵位，其弟托马斯·西摩爵士升至贵族，其子也升至伯爵身份，还有其他出色的皇家大臣都得到类似的升迁。国会决定于二月十六日召开会议，授予和确认这些头衔。同时，驾崩的国王的遗嘱里并未写出给这些头衔相应的领地，但国会知晓国王私下有这个意愿，认为可封西摩价值五百英镑土地，赫特福德的儿子价值八百英镑土地，还应留出价值三百英镑土地给下一任主教。现任国王已经同意了这些。","A secretary made report that forasmuch as the late King had provided in his will for conferring the ducal degree upon the Earl of Hertford and raising his brother, Sir Thomas Seymour, to the peerage, and likewise Hertford’s son to an earldom, together with similar aggrandisements to other great servants of the Crown, the Council had resolved to hold a sitting on the 16th of February for the delivering and confirming of these honours, and that meantime, the late King not having granted, in writing, estates suitable to the support of these dignities, the Council, knowing his private wishes in that regard, had thought proper to grant to Seymour ‘500 pound lands,’ and to Hertford’s son ‘800 pound lands, and 300 pound of the next bishop’s lands which should fall vacant,’—his present Majesty being willing."
"汤姆正要脱口而出，说挥霍这笔钱之前应该先偿还已逝国王的债务，却及时被有心的赫特福德碰了下胳膊，免了这轻率的言行。因此，他不加任何评价地做出御准，但他的内心十分不安。他坐下来，一瞬间想到自己正泰然自若地处理这些陌生而了不起的奇事，心头涌上一阵喜悦之情：为什么不封他的母亲为垃圾大院的女公爵，再给她封地？但是，悲伤的情绪马上就将喜悦一扫而光——他只不过是名义上的国王，这些严肃的老军人和大贵族们才是他的主人。他母亲对于他们只不过是他精神病的产物，他们听到他的提议，一定不会相信，只会请医生来。","Tom was about to blurt out something about the propriety of paying the late King’s debts first, before squandering all this money, but a timely touch upon his arm, from the thoughtful Hertford, saved him this indiscretion; wherefore he gave the royal assent, without spoken comment, but with much inward discomfort.While he sat reflecting a moment over the ease with which he was doing strange and glittering miracles, a happy thought shot into his mind: why not make his mother Duchess of Offal Court, and give her an estate?But a sorrowful thought swept it instantly away: he was only a king in name, these grave veterans and great nobles were his masters; to them his mother was only the creature of a diseased mind; they would simply listen to his project with unbelieving ears, and then send for the doctor."
"枯燥的工作沉闷地继续着。接着又宣读了请愿书、公告、特权书，以及各种冗长、反复又枯燥的公务文件。最后，汤姆哀婉地叹了口气，心想：“我犯了什么罪，仁慈的上帝要将我从田野、从自由的空气和阳光里带走，将我关到这里，做了国王，受此折磨？”他可怜的、混乱的脑袋开始打瞌睡，没一会儿，脑袋就耷拉到了肩膀上。因为没了批准国事的那个威严的力量，国事暂停。睡着的孩子周围一片沉静，王国的智者们停止了思虑。","The dull work went tediously on.Petitions were read, and proclamations, patents, and all manner of wordy, repetitious, and wearisome papers relating to the public business; and at last Tom sighed pathetically and murmured to himself, “In what have I offended, that the good God should take me away from the fields and the free air and the sunshine, to shut me up here and make me a king and afflict me so?”Then his poor muddled head nodded a while and presently drooped to his shoulder; and the business of the empire came to a standstill for want of that august factor, the ratifying power.Silence ensued around the slumbering child, and the sages of the realm ceased from their deliberations."
"上午，经过看护人赫特福德和圣约翰同意，汤姆与伊丽莎白公主和简·格雷郡主玩得很愉快。不过，由于皇宫里压抑的气氛，两位公主的心情也受了些影响。拜访快结束的时候，他“姐姐”，也就是后来历史上的“血腥玛丽”，跟他进行了一次严肃的会谈，这让他一阵心寒。在他看来，这个会谈只有一样好，那就是简短。他独自呆了会儿后，一个瘦瘦的、约摸十二岁的家伙被带到他面前。除了雪白的领口飞边和环腕的花边，他一袭黑衣——全身都是黑的，包括紧身衣和长筒袜。他没有戴服丧的徽章，只是在肩膀上用紫色丝带打了个结。他踌躇地走过来，脑袋低着，没有戴帽子，在汤姆前面单膝跪了下来。汤姆静静地坐着，严肃地凝视了他一会儿。然后，他说道：","During the forenoon, Tom had an enjoyable hour, by permission of his keepers, Hertford and St. John, with the Lady Elizabeth and the little Lady Jane Grey; though the spirits of the princesses were rather subdued by the mighty stroke that had fallen upon the royal house; and at the end of the visit his ‘elder sister’—afterwards the ‘Bloody Mary’ of history—chilled him with a solemn interview which had but one merit in his eyes, its brevity.He had a few moments to himself, and then a slim lad of about twelve years of age was admitted to his presence, whose clothing, except his snowy ruff and the laces about his wrists, was of black,—doublet, hose, and all.He bore no badge of mourning but a knot of purple ribbon on his shoulder.He advanced hesitatingly, with head bowed and bare, and dropped upon one knee in front of Tom.Tom sat still and contemplated him soberly a moment.Then he said—"
"“起来，朋友。你是谁？有何事？”","“Rise, lad.Who art thou.What wouldst have?”"
"男孩子站了起来，泰然自若，不过脸上却显出某种忧虑。他说：","The boy rose, and stood at graceful ease, but with an aspect of concern in his face.He said—"
"“您一定记得我，陛下。我是您的鞭童。”","“Of a surety thou must remember me, my lord.I am thy whipping-boy.”"
"“我的鞭童？”","“My whipping-boy?”"
"“是的，陛下。我是汉弗莱——汉弗莱·马洛。”","“The same, your Grace.I am Humphrey—Humphrey Marlow.”"
"汤姆感觉他的看护人应该先告知他这个人。这个场景很微妙。他应该怎么做？假装认识这个小伙子，然后让自己所说的话揭穿自己以前从没听说过他这一事实？不，那么做行不通。他想到一个能救自己的主意。这种事情可能会经常发生，而赫特福德和圣约翰是执行委员会的成员，常会因急事被叫走，所以，也许最好自己想出一个应对这种突发事件的万全之策。是的，这是明智的选择。他就拿这男孩做个练习，看看自己能做得如何。于是，他困窘地皱了皱眉毛，不一会儿，说道：","Tom perceived that here was someone whom his keepers ought to have posted him about.The situation was delicate.What should he do?—pretend he knew this lad, and then betray by his every utterance that he had never heard of him before?No, that would not do.An idea came to his relief: accidents like this might be likely to happen with some frequency, now that business urgencies would often call Hertford and St. John from his side, they being members of the Council of Executors; therefore perhaps it would be well to strike out a plan himself to meet the requirements of such emergencies.Yes, that would be a wise course—he would practise on this boy, and see what sort of success he might achieve.So he stroked his brow perplexedly a moment or two, and presently said—"
"“现在我好像模模糊糊记得你了，可我的病妨碍、削弱了我的心智——”","“Now I seem to remember thee somewhat—but my wit is clogged and dim with suffering—”"
"“哎呀，我可怜的主人！”鞭童伤心地说，接着又自言自语道：“真的，跟大家说的一样，他疯了。天啊，可怜的人！可我真是糟糕，我真爱忘事！他们说要装作看不出来他的病。”“很奇怪，这些天我的记忆都在跟我玩捉迷藏。”汤姆说道。“但没关系——我很快就好了——给我点提示，就常常能让我又想起来忘记的事情和人名。（其实，不仅是那些事情和人名，还有我以前从未听说的事情——这个小伙子会看到的。）说你的事情吧。”","“Alack, my poor master!”ejaculated the whipping-boy, with feeling; adding, to himself, “In truth ’tis as they said—his mind is gone—alas, poor soul!But misfortune catches me, how am I forgetting!They said one must not seem to observe that aught is wrong with him.”“’Tis strange how my memory doth wanton with me these days,” said Tom.“But mind it not—I mend apace—a little clue doth often serve to bring me back again the things and names which had escaped me.(And not they, only, forsooth, but e’en such as I ne’er heard before—as this lad shall see.) Give thy business speech.”"
"“陛下，只是无足轻重的事情，可是请容我启禀陛下。两天前，陛下您说希腊语时错了三次——上早课的时候，您记得吗？”","“’Tis matter of small weight, my liege, yet will I touch upon it, an’ it please your Grace.Two days gone by, when your Majesty faulted thrice in your Greek—in the morning lessons,—dost remember it?”"
"“是的——我想我记得。（这不是什么谎话。我的希腊语简直是一团糟，我不仅仅是错了三次，而是四十次。）是的，我确实记得，现在——继续讲。”","“Y-e-s—methinks I do.(It is not much of a lie—an’ I had meddled with the Greek at all, I had not faulted simply thrice, but forty times.) Yes, I do recall it, now—go on.”"
"“先生发了怒，说功课如此之马虎、不长进，为此发誓一定要好好鞭打我一顿，而且——”","“The master, being wroth with what he termed such slovenly and doltish work, did promise that he would soundly whip me for it—and—”"
"“鞭打你！”汤姆诧异万分，说道，","“Whip THEE!” said Tom, astonished out of his presence of mind."
"“他为什么因为我的错鞭打你？”“啊，陛下您又忘了。您没做好功课时，他总是鞭打我。”","“Why should he whip THEE for faults of mine?”“Ah, your Grace forgetteth again.He always scourgeth me when thou dost fail in thy lessons.”"
"“是的，是的，我忘记了。你私下教我，于是，如果我做不好功课，他就认为你失职，就——”","“True, true—I had forgot.Thou teachest me in private—then if I fail, he argueth that thy office was lamely done, and—”"
"“啊，陛下，您怎么能这么说？我，您最卑微的仆人，来教您？”","“Oh, my liege, what words are these?I, the humblest of thy servants, presume to teach THEE?”"
"“那么，你错在哪里？这是怎么回事？是我真的疯了，还是你呢？解释——说清楚。”","“Then where is thy blame?What riddle is this?Am I in truth gone mad, or is it thou?Explain—speak out.”"
"“但是，仁慈的陛下，没有什么需要解释的。谁都不能够打不可冒犯的威尔士王子，所以当他犯错时，就由我来受罚。这是应该的，因为这就是我的职责和生计。”","“But, good your Majesty, there’s nought that needeth simplifying.—None may visit the sacred person of the Prince of Wales with blows; wherefore, when he faulteth, ’tis I that take them; and meet it is and right, for that it is mine office and my livelihood.”"
"汤姆盯着这个安静的男孩，自语道：“瞧，真是神奇的事情，真是非常离奇、罕见的一桩事情。我真惊讶，他们怎么没有雇用一个专门为我捡梳落的头发和衣物的人。天啊，也许他们会的！他们会这么做的，我要自己挨打，感谢上帝让我替换他吧。”","Tom stared at the tranquil boy, observing to himself, “Lo, it is a wonderful thing,—a most strange and curious trade; I marvel they have not hired a boy to take my combings and my dressings for me—would heaven they would!—an’ they will do this thing, I will take my lashings in mine own person, giving God thanks for the change.”"
"接着，他大声说道：","Then he said aloud—"
"“按照誓言，你已经挨打了吗，可怜的朋友？”","“And hast thou been beaten, poor friend, according to the promise?”"
"“没有，仁慈的陛下。我的惩罚定在了今天，也可能被取消，因为在吊丧期间不适合执行惩罚。我不清楚，所以斗胆来这里，提醒仁慈的陛下，您曾答应为我求情的。”","“No, good your Majesty, my punishment was appointed for this day, and peradventure it may be annulled, as unbefitting the season of mourning that is come upon us; I know not, and so have made bold to come hither and remind your Grace about your gracious promise to intercede in my behalf—”"
"“跟老师求情吗？免除你的鞭打？”","“With the master?To save thee thy whipping?”"
"“啊，您真的记得！”","“Ah, thou dost remember!”"
"“我记忆恢复了，你看。放心，你的背不会受伤，我会处理这件事。”","“My memory mendeth, thou seest.Set thy mind at ease—thy back shall go unscathed—I will see to it.”"
"“啊，谢谢，我好心的主人！”男孩一边又跪下，一边哭喊道，“我可能说得够多了，不过——”","“Oh, thanks, my good lord!” cried the boy, dropping upon his knee again.“Mayhap I have ventured far enow; and yet—”"
"看到汉弗莱少爷犹豫，汤姆鼓励他继续说，告诉他：“你可以讲话了。”","Seeing Master Humphrey hesitate, Tom encouraged him to go on, saying he was “in the granting mood.”"
"“那我就说了，因为它一直萦绕在我心头。您不再是威尔士王子，而是成了国王，您可以按照自己的意愿下命令，没人会对您说不。所以，您不用再让枯燥的功课烦扰您，而可以把书烧掉，把心思花在不那么让人厌烦的事情上。那么，我就完了，我那孤苦的妹妹们也都完了！”","“Then will I speak it out, for it lieth near my heart.Sith thou art no more Prince of Wales but King, thou canst order matters as thou wilt, with none to say thee nay; wherefore it is not in reason that thou wilt longer vex thyself with dreary studies, but wilt burn thy books and turn thy mind to things less irksome.Then am I ruined, and mine orphan sisters with me!”"
"“完了？请问怎么完了？”","“Ruined?Prithee how?”"
"“我的后背就是我的生计啊，仁慈的陛下！如果后背闲着，我就要挨饿。您停了功课，我的职位将不复存在，因为您不再需要鞭童。不要赶我走！”","“My back is my bread, O my gracious liege!if it go idle, I starve.An’ thou cease from study mine office is gone thou’lt need no whipping-boy.Do not turn me away!”"
"汤姆被这凄惨的悲痛所触动。他以一种国王的仁慈语气说道：","Tom was touched with this pathetic distress.He said, with a right royal burst of generosity—"
"“你不用再苦恼，朋友。你的职位将永久属于你和你的家族，永远。”然后他用剑背轻轻拍了拍男孩的肩膀，宣布：“起来，汉弗莱·马洛，英国皇宫的世袭大鞭童！驱逐悲伤，我会再去读书，而且不好好学习，好让你的工资合理地涨三倍，因而你的职责将更加重大。”","“Discomfort thyself no further, lad.Thine office shall be permanent in thee and thy line for ever.”Then he struck the boy a light blow on the shoulder with the flat of his sword, exclaiming, “Rise, Humphrey Marlow, Hereditary Grand Whipping-Boy to the Royal House of England!Banish sorrow—I will betake me to my books again, and study so ill that they must in justice treble thy wage, so mightily shall the business of thine office be augmented.”"
"感恩的汉弗莱激动地回答道：","The grateful Humphrey responded fervidly—"
"“谢谢，啊，最高贵的主人，您的皇恩浩荡，超过了我最荒诞的发财梦。那么我可以整天无忧无虑，我之后的马洛家族也一样。”","“Thanks, O most noble master, this princely lavishness doth far surpass my most distempered dreams of fortune.Now shall I be happy all my days, and all the house of Marlow after me.”"
"汤姆十分聪明，料到这个家伙将会对他有帮助。他鼓励汉弗莱讲话，他也很愿意讲。他相信自己正在帮助汤姆“治愈”他的病，他很高兴，因为他注意到，只要他帮助汤姆患病的脑袋回忆起他在皇家学堂和皇宫其它地方的经历和奇事的各种细节，汤姆总能够清楚地忆起那些情境。一小时过后，汤姆觉得自己得到了很多关于宫廷里的人和事的有用信息，所以，他下决心每天从这里获取指导。为此，他下令，只要国王陛下身边没有其他人，只要汉弗莱能来，他就可以到自己房间来。汉弗莱刚刚退下，赫特福德公爵就为汤姆带来了更大的麻烦。","Tom had wit enough to perceive that here was a lad who could be useful to him.He encouraged Humphrey to talk, and he was nothing loath.He was delighted to believe that he was helping in Tom’s ‘cure’; for always, as soon as he had finished calling back to Tom’s diseased mind the various particulars of his experiences and adventures in the royal school-room and elsewhere about the palace, he noticed that Tom was then able to ‘recall’ the circumstances quite clearly.At the end of an hour Tom found himself well freighted with very valuable information concerning personages and matters pertaining to the Court; so he resolved to draw instruction from this source daily; and to this end he would give order to admit Humphrey to the royal closet whenever he might come, provided the Majesty of England was not engaged with other people.Humphrey had hardly been dismissed when my Lord Hertford arrived with more trouble for Tom."
"他说，议会议员害怕有些关于国王患病的夸大消息已经泄露，传到了国外。他们认为最明智的、最好的办法是，陛下应该在一两天之后当众用膳。陛下健康的神色和矫健的步伐，加上小心谨慎的从容仪态和优雅怡然的举止，将更能平息民众的躁动。假设真的传出了什么邪恶的谣言，实在无法想出其他更好的计划了。","He said that the Lords of the Council, fearing that some overwrought report of the King’s damaged health might have leaked out and got abroad, they deemed it wise and best that his Majesty should begin to dine in public after a day or two—his wholesome complexion and vigorous step, assisted by a carefully guarded repose of manner and ease and grace of demeanour, would more surely quiet the general pulse—in case any evil rumours had gone about—than any other scheme that could be devised."
"接着，伯爵小心翼翼地指导汤姆这种国家盛事的礼仪，拙劣地假装在“提醒”他那些他已经知晓的相关事情。但令他非常满意的是，在这件事上，汤姆不需要什么帮助。有关此事，他已经从汉弗莱那儿得到了帮助，因为汉弗莱提过，几天后他要开始当众用餐。这是从插了翅膀的宫廷流言中听来的。不过，汤姆没对别人说这些事情。","Then the Earl proceeded, very delicately, to instruct Tom as to the observances proper to the stately occasion, under the rather thin disguise of ‘reminding’ him concerning things already known to him; but to his vast gratification it turned out that Tom needed very little help in this line—he had been making use of Humphrey in that direction, for Humphrey had mentioned that within a few days he was to begin to dine in public; having gathered it from the swift-winged gossip of the Court.Tom kept these facts to himself, however."
"见国王的记忆恢复甚好，伯爵大胆地以一种表面上看起来很随意的方式进行了几次测试，查看他病情恢复的情况。结果有许多令人满意之处，即汉弗莱留下踪迹之处。总体上，伯爵非常高兴，深受鼓舞。他实在是感到备受鼓舞，于是，他用充满希望的语气大声说：","Seeing the royal memory so improved, the Earl ventured to apply a few tests to it, in an apparently casual way, to find out how far its amendment had progressed.The results were happy, here and there, in spots—spots where Humphrey’s tracks remained—and on the whole my lord was greatly pleased and encouraged.So encouraged was he, indeed, that he spoke up and said in a quite hopeful voice—"
"“现在我确信，如果陛下再稍微努力回忆一下，大御玺之谜将被解开。虽然这只是过去的损失，不是今天的，因为随着老国王逝去，它的任期也就结束了。请问，陛下可否试着回忆一下？”","“Now am I persuaded that if your Majesty will but tax your memory yet a little further, it will resolve the puzzle of the Great Seal—a loss which was of moment yesterday, although of none to-day, since its term of service ended with our late lord’s life.May it please your Grace to make the trial?”"
"汤姆茫然无措，完全不知大御玺为何物。犹豫片刻，他无辜地抬起目光，问道：","Tom was at sea—a Great Seal was something which he was totally unacquainted with.After a moment’s hesitation he looked up innocently and asked—"
"“它是什么样子的，伯爵？”","“What was it like, my lord?”"
"伯爵一惊，几乎察觉不到地自言自语道：“天啊，他的记忆又不见了！让他过度伤神真是下策”接着，他巧妙地将话题转移，好让汤姆不再想那御玺的事，而他的目的很容易就达到了。","The Earl started, almost imperceptibly, muttering to himself, “Alack, his wits are flown again!—it was ill wisdom to lead him on to strain them”—then he deftly turned the talk to other matters, with the purpose of sweeping the unlucky seal out of Tom’s thoughts—a purpose which easily succeeded."
"第十五章 汤姆当国王","Chapter XV  Tom as King"
"第二天，外国使节带着衣着华丽的随从来了。汤姆十分庄严地坐在御座上，接见了他们。这幕壮观的场面十分悦目，于是，他放开了想象的缰绳。但是，要接见的人那么多，那么枯燥，说话的人也一样，于是，开始的愉悦渐渐变成了厌倦和思家。汤姆时不时说些赫特福德教他说的话，竭尽全力去表现得令人满意，可是，他对这些事情太生疏，又太紧张，他的表现只是差强人意。他看上去十分像国王，可他的感觉却怎么都不像。接见仪式结束时，他打心里高兴。","The next day the foreign ambassadors came, with their gorgeous trains; and Tom, throned in awful state, received them.The splendours of the scene delighted his eye and fired his imagination at first, but the audience was long and dreary, and so were most of the addresses—wherefore, what began as a pleasure grew into weariness and home-sickness by-and-by.Tom said the words which Hertford put into his mouth from time to time, and tried hard to acquit himself satisfactorily, but he was too new to such things, and too ill at ease to accomplish more than a tolerable success.He looked sufficiently like a king, but he was ill able to feel like one.He was cordially glad when the ceremony was ended."
"一天的大半时间被“浪费”在了国王公事上。“浪费”是他自己在脑中所用的词。就连国君两个小时的娱乐消遣也完全成了他的负担，因为限制和礼节仪式太多了，就像给娱乐消遣带上了脚镣。不过，他与鞭童拥有一小时的私人时间，他视之为单纯受益，因为他既可从中消遣，又可得到有用的信息。","The larger part of his day was ‘wasted’—as he termed it, in his own mind—in labours pertaining to his royal office.Even the two hours devoted to certain princely pastimes and recreations were rather a burden to him than otherwise, they were so fettered by restrictions and ceremonious observances.However, he had a private hour with his whipping-boy which he counted clear gain, since he got both entertainment and needful information out of it."
"汤姆·坎蒂当上国王的第三天跟前两天的情景差不多，只是更熟悉了一些，较初进宫时少了些不安。他渐渐地有点习惯了他所处的环境和周围事物。他的枷锁仍旧还在，但不是一直都在。随着时间一小时一小时地过去，他发现大臣的在场和致敬对他造成的痛苦和不安越来越小。","The third day of Tom Canty’s kingship came and went much as the others had done, but there was a lifting of his cloud in one way—he felt less uncomfortable than at first; he was getting a little used to his circumstances and surroundings; his chains still galled, but not all the time; he found that the presence and homage of the great afflicted and embarrassed him less and less sharply with every hour that drifted over his head."
"他本来可以轻轻松松地度过第四天的，但有一件事情令他畏惧，那就是从这一天开始的公开用餐。日程中有更重大的事情。这一天，他要主持会议，宣布对伟大的地球上远远近近的国家实行的对外政策，会议将采纳他的观点和命令。而且，这一天，赫特福德将正式被任命为摄政大臣。其他重要的事情也安排在了第四天。但是，对于汤姆来说，这些都没有用餐的考验更重大。宴会上，他要独自面对许多双盯着他的好奇的眼睛，面对许多张悄声评论他的表现的嘴巴，如果他不幸出错的话，他们还会评论他的错误。","But for one single dread, he could have seen the fourth day approach without serious distress—the dining in public; it was to begin that day.There were greater matters in the programme—for on that day he would have to preside at a council which would take his views and commands concerning the policy to be pursued toward various foreign nations scattered far and near over the great globe; on that day, too, Hertford would be formally chosen to the grand office of Lord Protector; other things of note were appointed for that fourth day, also; but to Tom they were all insignificant compared with the ordeal of dining all by himself with a multitude of curious eyes fastened upon him and a multitude of mouths whispering comments upon his performance,—and upon his mistakes, if he should be so unlucky as to make any."
"然而，没有什么能阻止这第四天的到来，于是它来了。这一天，可怜的汤姆无精打采，心不在焉，这样的情绪挥之不去。早上的例事持续太久，已让他感到了疲倦。他又一次感觉到身上沉重的束缚感。","Still, nothing could stop that fourth day, and so it came.It found poor Tom low-spirited and absent-minded, and this mood continued; he could not shake it off.The ordinary duties of the morning dragged upon his hands, and wearied him.Once more he felt the sense of captivity heavy upon him."
"上午晚些时候，在一间宽敞的接见室里，他一边和赫特福德伯爵交谈，一边无聊地等待时钟敲响，等待预定举行接见许多重要官员和大臣的仪式的时刻。","Late in the forenoon he was in a large audience-chamber, conversing with the Earl of Hertford and dully awaiting the striking of the hour appointed for a visit of ceremony from a considerable number of great officials and courtiers."
"过了一小会儿，汤姆漫不经心地走到窗前，对宫外大公路上的生活和奔忙的情景非常感兴趣。他不是慵懒地感兴趣，而是全心地渴望自己能加入它的热闹和自由。他看到一辆货车沿路驶来，车上载着一群又喊又叫的最底层、最贫穷的不整洁的男人、女人和孩子。","After a little while, Tom, who had wandered to a window and become interested in the life and movement of the great highway beyond the palace gates—and not idly interested, but longing with all his heart to take part in person in its stir and freedom—saw the van of a hooting and shouting mob of disorderly men, women, and children of the lowest and poorest degree approaching from up the road."
"“我想知道发生了什么事情！”他带着一个男孩对这些事情的好奇心大声说道。","“I would I knew what ’tis about!” he exclaimed, with all a boy’s curiosity in such happenings."
"“您是国王！”伯爵鞠了一躬，庄严地答道，“陛下可以允许我离开去问这件事吗？”","“Thou art the King!” solemnly responded the Earl, with a reverence.“Have I your Grace’s leave to act?”"
"“噢，真好，当然可以！噢，真高兴，当然可以！”汤姆兴奋地大声说，又十分满意地自语道，“其实，当国王也不全是枯燥，也有它的回报和方便。”","“O blithely, yes! O gladly, yes!” exclaimed Tom excitedly, adding to himself with a lively sense of satisfaction, “In truth, being a king is not all dreariness—it hath its compensations and conveniences.”"
"伯爵唤来一名侍者，派他带了命令去找守卫长：","The Earl called a page, and sent him to the captain of the guard with the order—"
"“让这群暴徒停下来，问问发生了什么事情。这是国王的命令！”","“Let the mob be halted, and inquiry made concerning the occasion of its movement.By the King’s command!”"
"几秒钟之后，一长队皇家守卫，穿着光闪闪的钢甲，从大门鱼贯而出，在马路上横向一字排开，挡住了这群人。信使回来了，说一个男人、一个女人和一个年轻的女孩犯了扰乱国家治安和破坏国家尊严的罪，正押去行刑，人们跟在后面看热闹。","A few seconds later a long rank of the royal guards, cased in flashing steel, filed out at the gates and formed across the highway in front of the multitude.A messenger returned, to report that the crowd was following a man, a woman, and a young girl to execution for crimes committed against the peace and dignity of the realm."
"死刑，残暴的死刑，这些可怜的不幸的人！这个想法缠绕着汤姆的心弦。怜悯之情挟持了他，让他无法考虑其他事。他不曾想到被践踏的法律，不曾想到这三个罪犯使受害人遭受的悲伤和损失——他无法想到任何事情，除了断头台和悬在罪犯头上的可怕命运。那一刻，他的焦虑甚至使他忘记自己只是国王的假影子，并不是真国王。在他回过神来之前，他已经脱口下达了命令：","Death—and a violent death—for these poor unfortunates!The thought wrung Tom’s heart-strings.The spirit of compassion took control of him, to the exclusion of all other considerations; he never thought of the offended laws, or of the grief or loss which these three criminals had inflicted upon their victims; he could think of nothing but the scaffold and the grisly fate hanging over the heads of the condemned.His concern made him even forget, for the moment, that he was but the false shadow of a king, not the substance; and before he knew it he had blurted out the command—"
"“把他们带到这儿来！”","“Bring them here!”"
"随后，他满脸通红，嘴上要说道歉的话。但当他看到伯爵和侍者没有因为他的命令显出惊讶的神色，便把将要说出口的话又咽了回去。侍者郑重地深深敬了个礼，然后退出房间去传达命令。汤姆体会到了一种强烈的自豪感，感到了一种新的当国王的好处。他心想：“真的像我读老神父的故事时常常感觉到的一样。那时，我确实把自己想象成了一个王子，对所有人发号施令，说‘做这个，做那个’，而没有人敢怠慢或违抗我的命令。”","Then he blushed scarlet, and a sort of apology sprung to his lips; but observing that his order had wrought no sort of surprise in the Earl or the waiting page, he suppressed the words he was about to utter.The page, in the most matter-of-course way, made a profound obeisance and retired backwards out of the room to deliver the command.Tom experienced a glow of pride and a renewed sense of the compensating advantages of the kingly office.He said to himself, “Truly it is like what I was used to feel when I read the old priest’s tales, and did imagine mine own self a prince, giving law and command to all, saying ‘Do this, do that,’ whilst none durst offer let or hindrance to my will.”"
"这时，门开了。有人一个接一个地宣读着一些听起来很高的官衔，接着，拥有这些官衔的人出现了，宫殿很快就被贵族们和他们华丽的衣服挤占了一半。但是，汤姆几乎没有注意到在场的人们，他是那么紧张，那么热情地专注于另外一件更有趣的事情。他心不在焉地坐在皇椅上，眼睛转向门的方向，显出不耐烦的期待。群臣见状，不敢去烦扰他，于是，他们彼此聊起了公共事务和宫廷流言。","Now the doors swung open; one high-sounding title after another was announced, the personages owning them followed, and the place was quickly half-filled with noble folk and finery.But Tom was hardly conscious of the presence of these people, so wrought up was he and so intensely absorbed in that other and more interesting matter.He seated himself absently in his chair of state, and turned his eyes upon the door with manifestations of impatient expectancy; seeing which, the company forbore to trouble him, and fell to chatting a mixture of public business and court gossip one with another."
"过了一小会儿，听到军队整齐的步伐声逼近，代理警官押着犯人进来了，后面跟着国王的守卫队。文官在汤姆前下跪，之后站在一旁；三个被判死刑的人也跪下，就一直这么跪着；守卫站到了汤姆的椅子后面。汤姆好奇地审视了囚犯一番。这个男人的衣服和面容中的某种东西勾起了他模糊的记忆。“我觉得我以前见过这个男人……但想不起来是什么时候，在哪儿见过。”汤姆这么想着。正在这时，这男人迅速地朝上看了一眼，又因不能承受君主的威严而迅速地低下了头。但是，汤姆只对他的整张脸瞥了一眼就够了。他心想：“现在弄清楚了；这是将贾尔斯·威特从泰晤士河捞上来救了他的命的那个陌生人。那天刮着风，很冷，那是新年的第一天。这是一件勇敢的好事，可惜他干了坏事，将自己陷入这种悲惨的境地……我没有忘记那天，也没有忘记那一刻，因为一个小时之后，钟敲响了十一下，我挨了坎蒂奶奶的一顿打。她打得那么毒，那么狠，相比之下，之前或之后挨的打都成了爱抚和抚摸。”","In a little while the measured tread of military men was heard approaching, and the culprits entered the presence in charge of an under-sheriff and escorted by a detail of the king’s guard.The civil officer knelt before Tom, and then stood aside; the three doomed persons knelt, also, and remained so; the guard took position behind Tom’s chair.Tom scanned the prisoners curiously.Something about the dress or appearance of the man had stirred a vague memory in him.“Methinks I have seen this man ere now ...But the when or the where fail me.”—Such was Tom’s thought.Just then the man glanced quickly up and quickly dropped his face again, not being able to endure the awful port of sovereignty; but the one full glimpse of the face which Tom got was sufficient.He said to himself: “Now is the matter clear; this is the stranger that plucked Giles Witt out of the Thames, and saved his life, that windy, bitter, first day of the New Year—a brave good deed—pity he hath been doing baser ones and got himself in this sad case ...I have not forgot the day, neither the hour; by reason that an hour after, upon the stroke of eleven, I did get a hiding by the hand of Gammer Canty which was of so goodly and admired severity that all that went before or followed after it were but fondlings and caresses by comparison.”"
"汤姆立刻下令暂时让那个女人和女孩退出去，然后对代理警官说道：","Tom now ordered that the woman and the girl be removed from the presence for a little time; then addressed himself to the under-sheriff, saying—"
"“好心的先生，这个人犯了什么罪？”","“Good sir, what is this man’s offence?”"
"警官跪下答道：","The officer knelt, and answered—"
"“尊敬的陛下，他用毒药毒死了人。”","“So please your Majesty, he hath taken the life of a subject by poison.”"
"汤姆惊异万分，他对囚犯的同情和对这位搭救落水儿童的勇敢者的敬佩遭到了严重的破坏。","Tom’s compassion for the prisoner, and admiration of him as the daring rescuer of a drowning boy, experienced a most damaging shock."
"“已经证实是他做的了吗？”他问道。","“The thing was proven upon him?” he asked."
"“毫无疑问，陛下。”","“Most clearly, sire.”"
"汤姆叹了口气，说：","Tom sighed, and said—"
"“把他带走吧，死亡是他的报应。真是可惜，因为他有颗勇敢的心——不，不，我的意思是，他长了一副勇敢的模样！”","“Take him away—he hath earned his death.’Tis a pity, for he was a brave heart—na—na, I mean he hath the look of it!”"
"囚犯忽然用力攥紧双手，绝望地拧着，同时哀求地向“国王”诉说，言语破碎而惊慌：","The prisoner clasped his hands together with sudden energy, and wrung them despairingly, at the same time appealing imploringly to the ‘King’ in broken and terrified phrases—"
"“哦，我的主，国王，您要可怜迷失的人，可怜可怜我！我是无辜的，我被控诉的罪行也没有充分的证据，而我也不想说这些。法官判我有罪，可能不会再更改，可是，在我临死之前，我恳求您的恩惠，因为我无法忍受对我的判决。发发慈悲，发发慈悲，我的主国王！以您高贵的同情心，答应我的恳求吧，下令对我执行绞刑！”","“O my lord the King, an’ thou canst pity the lost, have pity upon me!I am innocent—neither hath that wherewith I am charged been more than but lamely proved—yet I speak not of that; the judgment is gone forth against me and may not suffer alteration; yet in mine extremity I beg a boon, for my doom is more than I can bear.A grace, a grace, my lord the King!in thy royal compassion grant my prayer—give commandment that I be hanged!”"
"汤姆很惊讶。这不是他期望的结果。","Tom was amazed.This was not the outcome he had looked for."
"“没见过这样的怪事，真是奇怪的恩惠！您不是要执行绞刑吗？”","“Odds my life, a strange boon!Was it not the fate intended thee?”"
"“噢，好心的君王，不是这样的！按照命令，我要被活生生煮死！”","“O good my liege, not so!It is ordered that I be BOILED ALIVE!”"
"这一番话让人惊骇不已，汤姆差点从椅子上跳起来。他一回过神，就大声说道：","The hideous surprise of these words almost made Tom spring from his chair.As soon as he could recover his wits he cried out—"
"“我答应你的要求，可怜的人！即使你毒死了一百个人，也不应该遭受这样残忍的死刑。”","“Have thy wish, poor soul!an’ thou had poisoned a hundred men thou shouldst not suffer so miserable a death.”"
"囚犯脸朝地面跪下，突然激动地说了很多感谢之言，最后说：","The prisoner bowed his face to the ground and burst into passionate expressions of gratitude—ending with—"
"“难得您知道什么是厄运，这是上帝所不允许的！希望您今天对我的恩惠能被铭记，并得到报答！”汤姆转向赫特福德伯爵，说道：","“If ever thou shouldst know misfortune—which God forefend!—may thy goodness to me this day be remembered and requited!”Tom turned to the Earl of Hertford, and said—"
"“伯爵，这种酷刑真的有必要吗？”","“My lord, is it believable that there was warrant for this man’s ferocious doom?”"
"“这是法律规定对囚犯实施的，陛下。在德国，伪造货币者被判在油锅里煮死——不是一下子扔进去，而是用绳子吊着，一点点、慢慢地往油里面放，先是脚，然后是腿，然后——”","“It is the law, your Grace—for poisoners.In Germany coiners be boiled to death in OIL—not cast in of a sudden, but by a rope let down into the oil by degrees, and slowly; first the feet, then the legs, then—”"
"“噢，请别说了，伯爵，我受不了！”汤姆用手捂住双眼，好不再想象那样的情景，喊道，“我请善良的伯爵接受我的命令，改变这项法律。噢，不要再让可怜的人遭受这种刑罚了。”","“O prithee no more, my lord, I cannot bear it!” cried Tom, covering his eyes with his hands to shut out the picture.“I beseech your good lordship that order be taken to change this law—oh, let no more poor creatures be visited with its tortures.”"
"伯爵脸上露出了十分喜悦的神情，因为他是个有颗仁慈、宽容的心的人。这在当时那个残酷的年代的贵族中是很少见的。他说：","The Earl’s face showed profound gratification, for he was a man of merciful and generous impulses—a thing not very common with his class in that fierce age.He said—"
"“陛下金口御言，这项法律就被废除了。历史会铭记这一刻，这是您皇家的荣耀。”","“These Grace’s noble words have sealed its doom.History will remember it to the honour of your royal house.”"
"代理警官正要带走他的囚犯，汤姆示意他等等，然后说道：","The under-sheriff was about to remove his prisoner; Tom gave him a sign to wait; then he said—"
"“好心的先生，我要深入调查这件事。这个男人说他的罪没有充分的证据证实。你知道些什么，都告诉我。”“陛下容我禀报，在这个案子里，这个人进入伊斯灵顿小村庄的一所房子里，那里面躺着一个病人。三个证人说当时是早上十点，两个证人说是十点过几分钟。那时，病人独自一人，睡着了。不一会儿，这个男人又走了出来，扬长而去。一小时内，病人就抽筋呕吐而死。”","“Good sir, I would look into this matter further.The man has said his deed was but lamely proved.Tell me what thou knowest.”“If the King’s grace please, it did appear upon the trial that this man entered into a house in the hamlet of Islington where one lay sick—three witnesses say it was at ten of the clock in the morning, and two say it was some minutes later—the sick man being alone at the time, and sleeping—and presently the man came forth again and went his way.The sick man died within the hour, being torn with spasms and retchings.”"
"“有人亲眼看见他下毒药了吗？毒药找到了吗？”","“Did any see the poison given?Was poison found?”"
"“哎呀，没有，陛下。”","“Marry, no, my liege.”"
"“那怎么知道那个人是被毒死的呢？”","“Then how doth one know there was poison given at all?”"
"“陛下容禀，几位医生证明，只有被毒死的人才是这样的症状。”","“Please your Majesty, the doctors testified that none die with such symptoms but by poison.”"
"在那个简单的时代，这是重大的证据。汤姆认识到了它的重要性，说道：","Weighty evidence, this, in that simple age.Tom recognised its formidable nature, and said—"
"“医生懂自己的本行，也许他们是对的。这件事对这个可怜的男人不利。”","“The doctor knoweth his trade—belike they were right.The matter hath an ill-look for this poor man.”"
"“可还不止这些，陛下，还有更多、更糟糕的事。很多人证明，有个巫婆确实预言这个病人会死于毒药，是悄悄在他们耳边说的。从此，巫婆就离开了村子，没人知道她去了哪儿。那巫婆还说，下毒的将是个陌生人，这个陌生人的头发是棕色的，穿着破旧、平常的衣服，而这个囚犯确实非常符合巫婆的预言。既然这桩罪行是符合预言的，请陛下赐予它应有的庄严的分量。”","“Yet was not this all, your Majesty; there is more and worse.Many testified that a witch, since gone from the village, none know whither, did foretell, and speak it privately in their ears, that the sick man WOULD DIE BY POISON—and more, that a stranger would give it—a stranger with brown hair and clothed in a worn and common garb; and surely this prisoner doth answer woundily to the bill.Please your Majesty to give the circumstance that solemn weight which is its due, seeing it was FORETOLD.”"
"在那个迷信的时代，这是极其有力的论据。汤姆觉得事已至此，无可改变了。如果证据还有效的话，这个可怜的家伙的罪行是成立的。不过，他还是给了囚犯一个机会，说道：","This was an argument of tremendous force in that superstitious day.Tom felt that the thing was settled; if evidence was worth anything, this poor fellow’s guilt was proved.Still he offered the prisoner a chance, saying—"
"“如果你有什么要为自己辩护的，尽管说。”“我的国王，说什么都没用。我是无辜的，可我没办法证明。我没有朋友，否则，也许可以证明我当天不在伊斯灵顿，从而也可能证明，在他们说的那个时刻，我离那里不止一里格远，因为我正在沃平的老楼梯那儿。是的，还有，我的国王，我可以证明，他们说我那个时间在杀人，其实我正在救人。一个落水的男孩——”“等等！警官，告诉我犯罪的日期！”","“If thou canst say aught in thy behalf, speak.”“Nought that will avail, my King.I am innocent, yet cannot I make it appear.I have no friends, else might I show that I was not in Islington that day; so also might I show that at that hour they name I was above a league away, seeing I was at Wapping Old Stairs; yea more, my King, for I could show, that whilst they say I was taking life, I was saving it.A drowning boy—”“Peace!Sheriff, name the day the deed was done!”"
"“早上十点，或十点过几分，新年的第一天，最明显的——”","“At ten in the morning, or some minutes later, the first day of the New Year, most illustrious—”"
"“放了这个囚犯——这是国王的命令！”","“Let the prisoner go free—it is the King’s will!”"
"这不像一国之君说的话一出口，他又红了脸。他尽力遮掩自己冒失的言行，接着说道：","Another blush followed this unregal outburst, and he covered his indecorum as well as he could by adding—"
"“这么空洞、轻率的证据就判他绞刑，让我很恼怒！”","“It enrageth me that a man should be hanged upon such idle, hare-brained evidence!”"
"众人中传出来低低的敬佩之声。不是敬佩汤姆颁布的这个命令，因为不管是同意还是敬佩，很少有人认为释放一个判决的囚犯是合适或适宜的。不，他们钦佩的是汤姆表现出来的机智和精神。有些低语是这么说的：","A low buzz of admiration swept through the assemblage.It was not admiration of the decree that had been delivered by Tom, for the propriety or expediency of pardoning a convicted poisoner was a thing which few there would have felt justified in either admitting or admiring—no, the admiration was for the intelligence and spirit which Tom had displayed.Some of the low-voiced remarks were to this effect—"
"“这不是疯国王——他的智慧是健全的。”","“This is no mad king—he hath his wits sound.”"
"“他多么稳妥地处理了他的问题，果断直接地处理这件事情，多么像以前那个正常的他！”","“How sanely he put his questions—how like his former natural self was this abrupt imperious disposal of the matter!”"
"“感谢上帝，他的病好了！这不是弱者，而是国王。他表现得像他的父亲了。”","“God be thanked, his infirmity is spent!This is no weakling, but a king.He hath borne himself like to his own father.”"
"空气里充满了赞许，汤姆当然也感觉到了一点儿。于是，他变得十分放松，处理起事情来也令人满意。","The air being filled with applause, Tom’s ear necessarily caught a little of it.The effect which this had upon him was to put him greatly at his ease, and also to charge his system with very gratifying sensations."
"但是，他作为少年固有的好奇心很快战胜了这些愉快的想法和感觉，他很想知道这个女人和小女孩犯了什么死罪。所以，遵照他的命令，两个吓坏了的、哭哭啼啼的人被带到了他面前。","However, his juvenile curiosity soon rose superior to these pleasant thoughts and feelings; he was eager to know what sort of deadly mischief the woman and the little girl could have been about; so, by his command, the two terrified and sobbing creatures were brought before him."
"“他们犯了什么罪？”他问警官。","“What is it that these have done?” he inquired of the sheriff."
"“启禀陛下，他们被控犯了邪恶的罪行，证据确凿。因此，根据法律，法官判决她们绞刑。她们把自己出卖给了魔鬼，这就是她们的罪行。”","“Please your Majesty, a black crime is charged upon them, and clearly proven; wherefore the judges have decreed, according to the law, that they be hanged.They sold themselves to the devil—such is their crime.”"
"汤姆不寒而栗。他被教导过要憎恨做这种邪恶的事情的人。不过，他不准备为此而牺牲满足自己好奇心的乐趣，所以他问道：","Tom shuddered.He had been taught to abhor people who did this wicked thing.Still, he was not going to deny himself the pleasure of feeding his curiosity for all that; so he asked—"
"“犯罪地点是哪儿？时间呢？”","“Where was this done?—and when?”"
"“十二月的一个午夜，在一座荒废的教堂里，陛下。”","“On a midnight in December, in a ruined church, your Majesty.”"
"汤姆又打了个冷战。","Tom shuddered again."
"“当时谁在场？”","“Who was there present?”"
"“只有这两个人，陛下——和那个魔鬼。”","“Only these two, your grace—and THAT OTHER.”"
"“她们招认了吗？”","“Have these confessed?”"
"“没有，没有招，陛下，她们就是不承认。”","“Nay, not so, sire—they do deny it.”"
"“那么，请问怎么知道这件事的？”","“Then prithee, how was it known?”"
"“有个目击证人确实看到她们朝那个方向走去，好心的陛下，这引起了人们的怀疑，而之后可怕的结果也确证了这一点。特别是，证据证明她们通过由此得来的魔法召来暴风雨，将这一带摧残得一片荒芜。超过四十个证人为这场暴风雨作了证。其实，上千人可以来作证，因为所有人都遭了灾害，都有理由记得它。”","“Certain witness did see them wending thither, good your Majesty; this bred the suspicion, and dire effects have since confirmed and justified it.In particular, it is in evidence that through the wicked power so obtained, they did invoke and bring about a storm that wasted all the region round about.Above forty witnesses have proved the storm; and sooth one might have had a thousand, for all had reason to remember it, sith all had suffered by it.”"
"“这确实是件严重的事情。”汤姆脑子里想了一下这件邪恶卑劣的事情，接着说道：","“Certes this is a serious matter.”Tom turned this dark piece of scoundrelism over in his mind a while, then asked—"
"“这女人也遭受了暴风雨的灾难吧？”","“Suffered the woman also by the storm?”"
"众人中，几位元老对这个机智的问题点头赞赏。可是，警官没有看出问题所在，只是直接回答道：","Several old heads among the assemblage nodded their recognition of the wisdom of this question.The sheriff, however, saw nothing consequential in the inquiry; he answered, with simple directness—"
"“的确如此，陛下，人们都说她自作自受。她的住处给毁了，她自己和孩子都无家可归。”","“Indeed did she, your Majesty, and most righteously, as all aver.Her habitation was swept away, and herself and child left shelterless.”"
"“我觉得，这个给她自己造成如此大的灾难的魔法，真是买贵了。如果付了钱，哪怕只是一个法寻，她就上了当。如果她为此出卖了自己的灵魂，出卖了她孩子的灵魂，这说明她疯了。如果她疯了，她就不知道自己在做什么，所以不算犯罪。”","“Methinks the power to do herself so ill a turn was dearly bought.She had been cheated, had she paid but a farthing for it; that she paid her soul, and her child’s, argueth that she is mad; if she is mad she knoweth not what she doth, therefore sinneth not.”"
"元老们再次点头赞许汤姆的机智，有个人低语道：“据说国王自己疯了，那么这种疯病可以提高人的心智。我见过这种情况，如果这是仁慈的上帝的旨意，他们不得不发疯。”","The elderly heads nodded recognition of Tom’s wisdom once more, and one individual murmured, “An’ the King be mad himself, according to report, then is it a madness of a sort that would improve the sanity of some I wot of, if by the gentle providence of God they could but catch it.”"
"“这孩子几岁了？”汤姆问道。","“What age hath the child?” asked Tom."
"“九岁，陛下。”","“Nine years, please your Majesty.”"
"“根据英国律法，儿童可以结成契约，把自己卖了吗，法官？”汤姆转向一位颇有学识的法官，问道。","“By the law of England may a child enter into covenant and sell itself, my lord?” asked Tom, turning to a learned judge."
"“法律禁止儿童制造或参与任何重要的事情，好心的陛下，因为儿童的智力尚未健全，无法应付年长者健全的智力和害人的诡计。如果魔鬼愿意，它可以买儿童，儿童会同意，可成年的英国人就不会，在后者这样的情况下，契约是无效的。”","“The law doth not permit a child to make or meddle in any weighty matter, good my liege, holding that its callow wit unfitteth it to cope with the riper wit and evil schemings of them that are its elders.The DEVIL may buy a child, if he so choose, and the child agree thereto, but not an Englishman—in this latter case the contract would be null and void.”"
"“英国法律剥夺英国人为魔鬼效劳的权利，这似乎是粗鲁的非基督的事情，是不合理的条例！”汤姆喊道，流露出真实的激动。","“It seemeth a rude unchristian thing, and ill contrived, that English law denieth privileges to Englishmen to waste them on the devil!” cried Tom, with honest heat."
"对此事的新奇的看法让许多人笑了，也被很多人记在脑中，好到宫廷里去传说，证明汤姆很有独创性，也说明他的精神状态有所好转。","This novel view of the matter excited many smiles, and was stored away in many heads to be repeated about the Court as evidence of Tom’s originality as well as progress toward mental health."
"年长的犯人已经停止了抽泣，她仔细听着汤姆的话，饶有兴趣，心里有了希望。汤姆注意到了，也对她危险而孤立的境地非常同情。不一会儿，他问道：","The elder culprit had ceased from sobbing, and was hanging upon Tom’s words with an excited interest and a growing hope.Tom noticed this, and it strongly inclined his sympathies toward her in her perilous and unfriended situation.Presently he asked—"
"“她们如何施法召来暴风雨的？”","“How wrought they to bring the storm?”"
"“通过脱下她们的长筒袜，陛下。”","“BY PULLING OFF THEIR STOCKINGS, sire.”"
"听到这话，汤姆吃了一惊，他的兴趣也随之高涨。他急切地说：","This astonished Tom, and also fired his curiosity to fever heat.He said, eagerly—"
"“太奇妙了！这么做总是能造成这样可怕的后果吗？”","“It is wonderful!Hath it always this dread effect?”"
"“无一例外，陛下。至少，如果这女人想要这样的结果，并默默或出声念需要的咒语，就会这样。”汤姆转向这个女人，带着冲动的热情说道：“展示你的魔法吧——我想看到一场暴风雨！”迷信的众人突然面色苍白，都暗暗地想逃离这里。这些汤姆都没注意到，除了提出的暴风雨灾难，他对一切都不感兴趣。看到女人脸上迷惑和惊讶的神色，他兴奋地加了一句：","“Always, my liege—at least if the woman desire it, and utter the needful words, either in her mind or with her tongue.”Tom turned to the woman, and said with impetuous zeal—“Exert thy power—I would see a storm!”There was a sudden paling of cheeks in the superstitious assemblage, and a general, though unexpressed, desire to get out of the place—all of which was lost upon Tom, who was dead to everything but the proposed cataclysm.Seeing a puzzled and astonished look in the woman’s face, he added, excitedly—"
"“别害怕，你不会有事的。而且，你将被无罪释放，没人会伤害你。展示你的魔法吧。”","“Never fear—thou shalt be blameless.More—thou shalt go free—none shall touch thee.Exert thy power.”"
"“噢，国王陛下，我没有魔法，我是被冤枉的。”","“Oh, my lord the King, I have it not—I have been falsely accused.”"
"“你还是害怕。放心，你不会受到惩罚的。召来一场暴风雨，多小都没关系，我并不要很大或是有伤害性的暴风雨，而其实更喜欢小一些的。按我说的做，就可以免你死罪，你和你的孩子将被释放，得到国王的赦免，在这个国度里没人会再伤害你们或对你们怀有恶意。","“Thy fears stay thee.Be of good heart, thou shalt suffer no harm.Make a storm—it mattereth not how small a one—I require nought great or harmful, but indeed prefer the opposite—do this and thy life is spared—thou shalt go out free, with thy child, bearing the King’s pardon, and safe from hurt or malice from any in the realm.”"
"女人俯伏在地，泪流满面地否认说她没有创造奇迹的能力，否则，如果遵照国王的命令就能得到如此珍贵的恩泽的话，她会很高兴去挽救孩子一人的性命，不惜丢掉自己的性命。","The woman prostrated herself, and protested, with tears, that she had no power to do the miracle; else she would gladly win her child’s life alone, and be content to lose her own, if by obedience to the King’s command so precious a grace might be acquired."
"汤姆催促这女人，而她仍然坚持自己的说法。最后，他说道：","Tom urged—the woman still adhered to her declarations.Finally he said—"
"“我觉得这个女人说的是实话。如果换成我的母亲拥有魔鬼的法力的话，她肯定立即唤来了暴风雨，将整片大地毁于一旦，假如她因此可以换回我那即将失去的性命的话。其他的母亲也是一样的，这就是证据。你们自由了，女士，你和你的孩子都自由了，因为我认为你们无罪。现在你们已经被赦免，没什么可害怕的了。脱掉你们的长袜吧，给我唤来一场暴风雨，你将得到财富！”","“I think the woman hath said true.An’ MY mother were in her place and gifted with the devil’s functions, she had not stayed a moment to call her storms and lay the whole land in ruins, if the saving of my forfeit life were the price she got!It is argument that other mothers are made in like mould.Thou art free, goodwife—thou and thy child—for I do think thee innocent.Now thou’st nought to fear, being pardoned—pull off thy stockings!—an’ thou canst make me a storm, thou shalt be rich!”"
"得救的她大声地连连道谢，并准备遵守国王的命令。这时候，汤姆十分期待地看着，也有点担心，而大臣们这时也露出了明显的不适和不安的表情。女人脱掉了自己的袜子，也脱掉了小女孩的袜子，显然她想尽力召来一场地震以报答国王的恩泽，但却以失败和失望而告终。汤姆叹了口气，说道：","The redeemed creature was loud in her gratitude, and proceeded to obey, whilst Tom looked on with eager expectancy, a little marred by apprehension; the courtiers at the same time manifesting decided discomfort and uneasiness.The woman stripped her own feet and her little girl’s also, and plainly did her best to reward the King’s generosity with an earthquake, but it was all a failure and a disappointment.Tom sighed, and said—"
"“好了，善良的灵魂，别再自寻烦恼，你们已经失去了魔法。安心地回去吧。如果什么时候恢复了魔法，别忘了我，为我召来一场暴风雨。”","“There, good soul, trouble thyself no further, thy power is departed out of thee.Go thy way in peace; and if it return to thee at any time, forget me not, but fetch me a storm.”"
"第十六章 国宴","Chapter XVI  The State Dinner"
"晚宴时间快到了。但奇怪的是，汤姆想到此事时，竟然只有一点点的不自在，而几乎没有害怕。经历了早上的事情，他已经很好地建立了信心。经过四天,可怜的小家伙已经很适应他奇异的处境了。即便给一个成熟的人一整个月的时间，恐怕都不能像他这样适应。一个孩子适应环境的能力在这里展露无遗。","The dinner hour drew near—yet strangely enough, the thought brought but slight discomfort to Tom, and hardly any terror.The morning’s experiences had wonderfully built up his confidence; the poor little ash-cat was already more wonted to his strange garret, after four days’ habit, than a mature person could have become in a full month.A child’s facility in accommodating itself to circumstances was never more strikingly illustrated."
"趁汤姆正在为这次庄严的场合做准备，我们先享受下一睹为快的特权，到辉煌的盛宴厅里去看看那里的情况。这是个宽敞的殿堂，内有镀金的台柱和壁柱，墙壁和天花板上都雕刻了图案。门旁站着高大的守卫，他们穿着华丽、别致的服装，拿着戟，像雕塑一样纹丝不动。围绕大厅一周的高高的廊子里是乐队和一群拥挤的男女市民，他们都穿着亮闪闪的衣服。在殿堂中心处一座高起来的平台上摆着汤姆的桌子。现在，请古老的史官来说：","Let us privileged ones hurry to the great banqueting-room and have a glance at matters there whilst Tom is being made ready for the imposing occasion.It is a spacious apartment, with gilded pillars and pilasters, and pictured walls and ceilings.At the door stand tall guards, as rigid as statues, dressed in rich and picturesque costumes, and bearing halberds.In a high gallery which runs all around the place is a band of musicians and a packed company of citizens of both sexes, in brilliant attire.In the centre of the room, upon a raised platform, is Tom’s table.Now let the ancient chronicler speak:"
"“一位绅士拿着一根棒，另有一位拿着一块桌布，二人一起走进了大厅。他们以最高的敬意跪拜了三回，随后第二个人铺好桌布，二人再次跪拜之后，退了下去。接着，有另外两人走进来，其中一人又是手持一根棒，另一人拿着一个小盐瓶、一个盘子，还有面包。然后，他们像其他人一样跪拜，将拿来的东西摆在桌子上，也照着第一组进来的人的方式行了礼，然后退了出去。最后，进来了两位穿着华丽的贵族，一位拿着品尝刀，以最优雅的方式跪拜三次后，走到桌旁，用面包和盐擦拭桌子。那十分敬畏的神态，就像国王在场一样。”","“A gentleman enters the room bearing a rod, and along with him another bearing a tablecloth, which, after they have both kneeled three times with the utmost veneration, he spreads upon the table, and after kneeling again they both retire; then come two others, one with the rod again, the other with a salt-cellar, a plate, and bread; then they have kneeled as the others had done, and placed what was brought upon the table, they too retire with the same ceremonies performed by the first; at last come two nobles, richly clothed, one bearing a tasting-knife, who, after prostrating themselves three times in the most graceful manner, approach and rub the table with bread and salt, with as much awe as if the King had been present.”"
"庄严的准备工作就这样结束了。现在，回声荡漾的走廊深处突然传来了号角声和模糊的喊声：“国王驾到！伟大的国王陛下驾到！”喊声不时地重复，越来越近，不一会儿，几乎来到了眼前。卫队的声音隆隆鸣响，一个喊声响起：“国王驾到！”此时，光辉闪耀的盛装队伍出现在眼前，从门鱼贯而入，行进缓慢而有节奏。还是让史官来说吧：","So end the solemn preliminaries.Now, far down the echoing corridors we hear a bugle-blast, and the indistinct cry, “Place for the King!Way for the King’s most excellent majesty!”These sounds are momently repeated—they grow nearer and nearer—and presently, almost in our faces, the martial note peals and the cry rings out, “Way for the King!”At this instant the shining pageant appears, and files in at the door, with a measured march.Let the chronicler speak again:—"
"“先进来的是绅士、男爵、伯爵、勋章骑士，他们都穿着华丽的衣服，没有戴帽子。接着进来的是大法官，他走在两个人中间。那两个人一个拿着国王节杖，另一个拿着国剑，国剑红色的剑鞘上镶嵌着金鸢尾，剑尖朝上。接着走来的是国王本人。他一出现，十二支喇叭和许多鼓齐奏欢迎之声，同时，廊子里所有人都原地站了起来，喊道：‘上帝保佑国王！’他身后跟随着他的贵族们，左右有仪仗队护驾，他的五十位贵族侍卫拿着镀金的战斧。”","“First come Gentlemen, Barons, Earls, Knights of the Garter, all richly dressed and bareheaded; next comes the Chancellor, between two, one of which carries the royal sceptre, the other the Sword of State in a red scabbard, studded with golden fleurs-de-lis, the point upwards; next comes the King himself—whom, upon his appearing, twelve trumpets and many drums salute with a great burst of welcome, whilst all in the galleries rise in their places, crying ‘God save the King!’After him come nobles attached to his person, and on his right and left march his guard of honour, his fifty Gentlemen Pensioners, with gilt battle-axes.”"
"一切进行得顺利而愉悦。汤姆的脉搏跳得很快，他的眼睛里闪烁着欢喜的光芒。他举止温文尔雅，恰到好处。他更加从容了，因为他没有考虑如何去做，他的思想被周围欢乐的景象和声音所吸引和占据了。而且，穿上漂亮合身的衣服，谁都不可能没有一点风度，况且他已经有点适应了，尤其是此刻他并没有注意到这些。汤姆记起了自己得到的指导，他轻轻点了点装饰着羽毛的头，回应对他的问候，并彬彬有礼地说：“谢谢你们，我善良的臣民。”","This was all fine and pleasant.Tom’s pulse beat high, and a glad light was in his eye.He bore himself right gracefully, and all the more so because he was not thinking of how he was doing it, his mind being charmed and occupied with the blithe sights and sounds about him—and besides, nobody can be very ungraceful in nicely-fitting beautiful clothes after he has grown a little used to them—especially if he is for the moment unconscious of them.Tom remembered his instructions, and acknowledged his greeting with a slight inclination of his plumed head, and a courteous “I thank ye, my good people.”"
"他坐在桌旁，没有摘下自己的帽子。他对此并无丝毫尴尬，因为戴着帽子吃饭是国王和坎蒂家唯一共有的习惯，双方对它的熟悉程度都不逊色。盛宴开始了，场景如画，人们头上仍旧没有戴帽子。","He seated himself at table, without removing his cap; and did it without the least embarrassment; for to eat with one’s cap on was the one solitary royal custom upon which the kings and the Cantys met upon common ground, neither party having any advantage over the other in the matter of old familiarity with it.The pageant broke up and grouped itself picturesquely, and remained bareheaded."
"随着欢快的音乐声，皇家卫队走了进来，他们是“英国最高大、最强壮的人们，他们是照着这个标准仔细挑选来的”。不过，我们还是让史官来说说：","Now to the sound of gay music the Yeomen of the Guard entered,—“the tallest and mightiest men in England, they being carefully selected in this regard”—but we will let the chronicler tell about it:—"
"“王室卫士走进来了，头上没有戴帽子，穿着猩红的服装，背上绣着金色的玫瑰。他们来来去去，每次都端上来一道菜肴，菜肴盛在盘中。一位绅士按着顺序一一接过菜肴，摆在桌子上。这时，品菜官让每位守卫吃一口自己端上来的菜，以防菜有毒。”","“The Yeomen of the Guard entered, bareheaded, clothed in scarlet, with golden roses upon their backs; and these went and came, bringing in each turn a course of dishes, served in plate.These dishes were received by a gentleman in the same order they were brought, and placed upon the table, while the taster gave to each guard a mouthful to eat of the particular dish he had brought, for fear of any poison.”"
"汤姆吃得很好，尽管他知道上百只眼睛盯着他一口一口地吃，而且大家对看他吃饭饶有兴趣，就好像他吃的是一颗致命的炸弹，将会把他炸得满地都是碎片。他留心不让自己着急，同样留心不去亲自动手做什么，而是等着某位官员跪下来替他来完成。直到宴会结束，他都没有出错——真是一次完美、珍贵的胜利。","Tom made a good dinner, notwithstanding he was conscious that hundreds of eyes followed each morsel to his mouth and watched him eat it with an interest which could not have been more intense if it had been a deadly explosive and was expected to blow him up and scatter him all about the place.He was careful not to hurry, and equally careful not to do anything whatever for himself, but wait till the proper official knelt down and did it for him.He got through without a mistake—flawless and precious triumph."
"宴会终于结束了，他在光鲜亮丽的游行队伍中离去，耳边一片愉悦的嘈杂声，有轰鸣的号角声，翻滚起伏的鼓声,还有雷鸣般的欢呼声。他觉得，如果公共宴会最坏就是这样子，那他一天愿意忍受多次这样的考验，如果由此他能够逃离更难应付的皇家事务要求。","When the meal was over at last and he marched away in the midst of his bright pageant, with the happy noises in his ears of blaring bugles, rolling drums, and thundering acclamations, he felt that if he had seen the worst of dining in public it was an ordeal which he would be glad to endure several times a day if by that means he could but buy himself free from some of the more formidable requirements of his royal office."
"第十七章 佛佛一世","Chapter XVII  Foo-foo the First"
"迈尔斯·亨登急匆匆地走向萨瑟克那一侧的桥头，仔细地搜寻他要找的人，希望并盼望着马上追上他们。可是，他对此失望了。通过寻问，他朝萨瑟克的方向追了他们一段路，然后就没了任何踪迹，他不知下一步怎么办。不过，接下来几天，他还是尽自己所能继续寻找。黄昏，他双腿疲惫不堪，饿得半死，可他的期望却依然没有实现。于是，他在塔巴尔德旅馆吃过晚餐就睡了觉，打算第二天起个早，把这个城镇搜个遍。他躺着，想啊，计划啊，不一会儿，他开始这样推论：如果有机会的话，这个男孩会逃离那恶棍，他那所谓的父亲。他会回到伦敦，去他原来经常光顾的地方吗？不，他不会这么做，他要避免再被逮住。那么，他会怎么做？他在世界上从来没有过一个朋友，或一个保护人，直到遇到迈尔斯·亨登，他自然会努力再去找那个朋友，只要他能不再到伦敦，不再去冒险就行。他会赶往亨登庄园，这才是他会做的事情，因为他知道亨登是在回家的路途中，他可能有希望在那儿找到他。是的，亨登把事情想得很清楚了：他不能再在萨瑟克浪费时间，而要立刻动身，穿过肯特，朝修道士小岛去，在森林里搜寻，边走边问。现在让我们回来讲消失的小国王。","Miles Hendon hurried along toward the Southwark end of the bridge, keeping a sharp look-out for the persons he sought, and hoping and expecting to overtake them presently.He was disappointed in this, however.By asking questions, he was enabled to track them part of the way through Southwark; then all traces ceased, and he was perplexed as to how to proceed.Still, he continued his efforts as best he could during the rest of the day.Nightfall found him leg-weary, half-famished, and his desire as far from accomplishment as ever; so he supped at the Tabard Inn and went to bed, resolved to make an early start in the morning, and give the town an exhaustive search.As he lay thinking and planning, he presently began to reason thus: The boy would escape from the ruffian, his reputed father, if possible; would he go back to London and seek his former haunts?No, he would not do that, he would avoid recapture.What, then, would he do?Never having had a friend in the world, or a protector, until he met Miles Hendon, he would naturally try to find that friend again, provided the effort did not require him to go toward London and danger.He would strike for Hendon Hall that is what he would do, for he knew Hendon was homeward bound and there he might expect to find him.Yes, the case was plain to Hendon—he must lose no more time in Southwark, but move at once through Kent, toward Monk’s Holm, searching the wood and inquiring as he went.Let us return to the vanished little King now."
"伦敦桥上那家旅馆的服务生看到恶棍要与那个年轻人和国王会合。确切地说，他没有与他们会合，而是紧随其后，跟着他们的脚步。他没说话。他的左胳膊吊着，左眼睛上戴了一大块绿眼罩，脚有点跛，用橡树枝当拐棍。年轻人领着国王穿过萨瑟克弯弯曲曲的路，渐渐走到了远处的大路上。国王现在不耐烦了，说他要在这儿停下，亨登应该来找他，而不应该是他去找亨登。他不能容忍这样的傲慢，他就要停在这儿。年轻人说：","The ruffian whom the waiter at the inn on the bridge saw ‘about to join’ the youth and the King did not exactly join them, but fell in close behind them and followed their steps.He said nothing.His left arm was in a sling, and he wore a large green patch over his left eye; he limped slightly, and used an oaken staff as a support.The youth led the King a crooked course through Southwark, and by-and-by struck into the high road beyond.The King was irritated, now, and said he would stop here—it was Hendon’s place to come to him, not his to go to Hendon.He would not endure such insolence; he would stop where he was.The youth said—"
"“你朋友在远处树林里躺着，受伤了，你要在这里逗留吗？那就这样好了。”","“Thou’lt tarry here, and thy friend lying wounded in the wood yonder?So be it, then.”"
"国王的态度立刻变了。他大声喊道：","The King’s manner changed at once.He cried out—"
"“受伤了？是谁胆敢伤他？不过先不管这个，走吧，走吧！快点，小子！你鞋子灌铅了吗？他受伤了，是吗？即便是公爵的儿子做的，他现在也会后悔的！”","“Wounded?And who hath dared to do it?But that is apart; lead on, lead on!Faster, sirrah!Art shod with lead?Wounded, is he?Now though the doer of it be a duke’s son he shall rue it!”"
"离树林还有一段不短的距离，他们却很快就走到了。年轻人向四周看了看，发现一根大树枝插在地上，上面系着一小块破布。他领路走进树林里，一边留意相似的大树枝，发现每隔一段就有一个，显然它们是指引他到目的地的标志。渐渐地，他们到了一块空旷地，那里有农舍里烧剩的灰烬，旁边是一个快要坍塌的畜棚。哪儿都没有生命的迹象，只有极端的寂静。年轻人走进畜棚，国王急切地紧随其后。那里没人！国王惊讶而怀疑地望了年轻人一眼，问道：","It was some distance to the wood, but the space was speedily traversed.The youth looked about him, discovered a bough sticking in the ground, with a small bit of rag tied to it, then led the way into the forest, watching for similar boughs and finding them at intervals; they were evidently guides to the point he was aiming at.By-and-by an open place was reached, where were the charred remains of a farm-house, and near them a barn which was falling to ruin and decay.There was no sign of life anywhere, and utter silence prevailed.The youth entered the barn, the King following eagerly upon his heels.No one there!The King shot a surprised and suspicious glance at the youth, and asked—"
"“他在哪儿？”","“Where is he?”"
"他的回答是一阵嘲弄的笑声。国王立刻大怒。他抓起一根短木头，正要攻击年轻人，这时，又一阵嘲弄的笑声传进他耳朵里。笑声来自一直远远地跟着他们的那个跛脚的恶棍。国王转过身，生气地说道：","A mocking laugh was his answer.The King was in a rage in a moment; he seized a billet of wood and was in the act of charging upon the youth when another mocking laugh fell upon his ear.It was from the lame ruffian who had been following at a distance.The King turned and said angrily—"
"“你是谁？你来这儿做什么？”","“Who art thou?What is thy business here?”"
"“别说蠢话了，”那男人说，“你闭嘴。我虽乔装打扮，可也没打扮得你都可以假装不认识你父亲了。”","“Leave thy foolery,” said the man, “and quiet thyself.My disguise is none so good that thou canst pretend thou knowest not thy father through it.”"
"“你不是我父亲。我不认识你。我是国王。如果你把我的仆人藏起来了，给我把他找来，否则你就要为你所做的付出痛苦的代价。”","“Thou art not my father.I know thee not.I am the King.If thou hast hid my servant, find him for me, or thou shalt sup sorrow for what thou hast done.”"
"约翰·坎蒂用严厉、缓慢而克制的声音回答道：","John Canty replied, in a stern and measured voice—"
"“你真是疯了。我不想打你，但是如果你招惹我，我肯定会打你。你啰嗦这些，在这儿倒不碍事，没人会听你那些蠢话。不过，你最好学着小心说话，这样，我们到了新住处，也不会有什么祸事。我杀了人，不能再呆在家里。你也不能，因为我需要你的帮助。我隐姓埋名是有明智的理由的。我叫霍布斯——约翰·霍布斯。你叫杰克，你要好好记住。那么，现在，说话。你的母亲在哪儿？你的姐姐们在哪儿？她们没有到约定的地方来，你知道她们去哪儿了吗？”","“It is plain thou art mad, and I am loath to punish thee; but if thou provoke me, I must.Thy prating doth no harm here, where there are no ears that need to mind thy follies; yet it is well to practise thy tongue to wary speech, that it may do no hurt when our quarters change.I have done a murder, and may not tarry at home—neither shalt thou, seeing I need thy service.My name is changed, for wise reasons; it is Hobbs—John Hobbs; thine is Jack—charge thy memory accordingly.Now, then, speak.Where is thy mother?Where are thy sisters?They came not to the place appointed—knowest thou whither they went?”"
"国王愠怒地答道：","The King answered sullenly—"
"“别问我这些不着边际的事。我母亲去世了，我姐姐们在皇宫里。”","“Trouble me not with these riddles.My mother is dead; my sisters are in the palace.”"
"一旁的青年突然嘲弄地笑了起来。国王本来想去打他，但现在自称霍布斯的坎蒂制止了他，说：","The youth near by burst into a derisive laugh, and the King would have assaulted him, but Canty—or Hobbs, as he now called himself—prevented him, and said—"
"“别笑了，雨果，别烦他。他脑袋糊涂了，你这样让他更烦躁。杰克，坐下来，安静点，你很快就有东西吃了。”","“Peace, Hugo, vex him not; his mind is astray, and thy ways fret him.Sit thee down, Jack, and quiet thyself; thou shalt have a morsel to eat, anon.”"
"霍布斯和雨果开始小声交谈起来。国王走开，尽量远远地躲开他讨厌的同伴。暮色中，他退到畜棚的另一头，他发现地上铺了一英尺深的稻草。他躺在上面，抓了些稻草当毯子盖在身上，很快陷入了沉思。他有很多伤心事，但是有一件事最让他伤心，让他几乎忘了其它小事，那就是他失去了父亲。对于世界上其他人来说，亨利八世这个名字带来的是不寒而栗，它代表的是巨魔，他的鼻孔呼出的是毁灭，他的手制造的是惩罚和死亡。但是，对于这个男孩来说，这个名字带来的只有愉快的感觉，它唤起的那个人是满脸的温柔和慈爱。他想起了很多父亲和他度过的爱意融融的时光，于是情不自禁地陷入这些思绪当中。他泪流不止，证明了他内心的悲伤是多么沉重和真实。下午过去了，这孩子因烦恼而疲乏，渐渐地沉静下来，进入了疗伤的睡梦中。","Hobbs and Hugo fell to talking together, in low voices, and the King removed himself as far as he could from their disagreeable company.He withdrew into the twilight of the farther end of the barn, where he found the earthen floor bedded a foot deep with straw.He lay down here, drew straw over himself in lieu of blankets, and was soon absorbed in thinking.He had many griefs, but the minor ones were swept almost into forgetfulness by the supreme one, the loss of his father.To the rest of the world the name of Henry VIII. brought a shiver, and suggested an ogre whose nostrils breathed destruction and whose hand dealt scourgings and death; but to this boy the name brought only sensations of pleasure; the figure it invoked wore a countenance that was all gentleness and affection.He called to mind a long succession of loving passages between his father and himself, and dwelt fondly upon them, his unstinted tears attesting how deep and real was the grief that possessed his heart.As the afternoon wasted away, the lad, wearied with his troubles, sank gradually into a tranquil and healing slumber."
"过了很长时间，不知道过了有多久，他的意识挣扎着清醒了一半。他躺着，闭着眼，模模糊糊地想自己在哪儿，发生了什么事。这时，他听到了低低的声音，那是雨点沉闷地打在屋顶上的声音。一股温暖的舒适感冲遍全身，但又立即被尖尖的咯咯笑声和嘶哑的笑声一齐给粗鲁地打断了。他被惊醒了，很不高兴，于是探出脑袋，看看哪来的惊扰。他看到的是一幅令人厌恶、不堪入目的场景。畜棚的对面，地板中央燃烧着明亮的火堆，火堆旁围着一群衣衫褴褛的贫民窟乞丐和恶棍。他们被红色火光照得十分古怪，有男有女，他们懒洋洋地坐着或站着，四肢胡乱伸展着。他从来没有在书上见过或者梦到过这样的情景。有高大结实的男人，露着棕色的皮肤，长长的头发，穿着怪诞的破衣服；有中等身材的青年，一幅好斗的表情，穿着与其他人相似；有瞎子乞丐，眼睛戴着眼罩或扎着绷带；有瘸子，装了木头腿，拿着拐杖；有生病的人，透过不管用的包扎能看到化脓的部位；有一脸恶人相的拿着包裹的小贩；有磨刀匠，有补锅匠，有理发师，都拿着各自行业的工具；有些女的是未成年的少女，有些风华正茂，有些是年老、长满皱纹的丑太婆，个个都在大声叫嚷，厚颜无耻，满嘴脏话，脏兮兮的，不整洁；有三个脸色痛苦的婴儿；最后还有两条饿瘦的狗，脖子上套着链子，是用来给盲人引路的。","After a considerable time—he could not tell how long—his senses struggled to a half-consciousness, and as he lay with closed eyes vaguely wondering where he was and what had been happening, he noted a murmurous sound, the sullen beating of rain upon the roof.A snug sense of comfort stole over him, which was rudely broken, the next moment, by a chorus of piping cackles and coarse laughter.It startled him disagreeably, and he unmuffled his head to see whence this interruption proceeded.A grim and unsightly picture met his eye.A bright fire was burning in the middle of the floor, at the other end of the barn; and around it, and lit weirdly up by the red glare, lolled and sprawled the motliest company of tattered gutter-scum and ruffians, of both sexes, he had ever read or dreamed of.There were huge stalwart men, brown with exposure, long-haired, and clothed in fantastic rags; there were middle-sized youths, of truculent countenance, and similarly clad; there were blind mendicants, with patched or bandaged eyes; crippled ones, with wooden legs and crutches; diseased ones, with running sores peeping from ineffectual wrappings; there was a villain-looking pedlar with his pack; a knife-grinder, a tinker, and a barber-surgeon, with the implements of their trades; some of the females were hardly-grown girls, some were at prime, some were old and wrinkled hags, and all were loud, brazen, foul-mouthed; and all soiled and slatternly; there were three sore-faced babies; there were a couple of starveling curs, with strings about their necks, whose office was to lead the blind."
"夜晚降临，这一帮人的宴会刚刚结束，就开始了狂欢，酒坛子从一个人嘴边传到另一人嘴边。有人大喊一声：","The night was come, the gang had just finished feasting, an orgy was beginning; the can of liquor was passing from mouth to mouth.A general cry broke forth—"
"“来首歌！瞎子和瘸子献首歌！”","“A song!a song from the Bat and Dick and Dot-and-go-One!”"
"其中一个盲人站起来做准备：他把罩住他那健全的眼睛的眼罩扔到一边，把记述着他的不幸，好让人对他心生怜悯的布告扔开。瘸子丢掉碍事的木头腿，四肢健全地站在了流氓伙计的旁边。接着，他们吼了一曲欢快的小曲，每一节结束时，整群人都活跃地合唱，声音更响亮了。最后一节即将结束，半醉的热情达到了高潮。大家从一开始就合唱，直到唱完，声音震耳欲聋，椽子都被晃动了。鼓舞人心的歌词是这样的：","One of the blind men got up, and made ready by casting aside the patches that sheltered his excellent eyes, and the pathetic placard which recited the cause of his calamity.Dot-and-go-One disencumbered himself of his timber leg and took his place, upon sound and healthy limbs, beside his fellow-rascal; then they roared out a rollicking ditty, and were reinforced by the whole crew, at the end of each stanza, in a rousing chorus.By the time the last stanza was reached, the half-drunken enthusiasm had risen to such a pitch, that everybody joined in and sang it clear through from the beginning, producing a volume of villainous sound that made the rafters quake.These were the inspiring words:—"
"“那么再见了，痛饮、少妇和酒馆，可怜的朋友离开了，被流氓背叛，正去往绞刑架去往长眠的路上。所以，走吧，我漂亮的女人，走出伦敦，看看偷走你衣服的人，正在绞刑架上受刑。”（取自《英国无赖》，伦敦，1665年）","‘Bien Darkman’s then, Bouse Mort and Ken,The bien Coves bings awast,On Chates to trine by Rome Coves dineFor his long lib at last.Bing’d out bien Morts and toure, and toure,Bing out of the Rome vile bine,And toure the Cove that cloy’d your duds,Upon the Chates to trine.’(From‘The English Rogue.’ London, 1665.)"
"接着大家交谈起来，不是用歌里贼的黑话，因为那是只在旁边有敌人听时才会用的。从交谈中看来，“约翰·霍布斯”不是新成员，而是很早之前就在这帮人中混了。大家要他讲讲最近的经历。当他说起自己“意外地”杀了个人，大家表示相当满意。当他又说杀的是个神父，大家使劲地鼓起掌来，他便不得不跟每人都喝了一杯。老相识们高兴地欢迎他，新朋友们骄傲地跟他握手。有人问他为什么“消失了好几个月”。他回答说：","Conversation followed; not in the thieves’ dialect of the song, for that was only used in talk when unfriendly ears might be listening.In the course of it, it appeared that ‘John Hobbs’ was not altogether a new recruit, but had trained in the gang at some former time.His later history was called for, and when he said he had ‘accidentally’ killed a man, considerable satisfaction was expressed; when he added that the man was a priest, he was roundly applauded, and had to take a drink with everybody.Old acquaintances welcomed him joyously, and new ones were proud to shake him by the hand.He was asked why he had ‘tarried away so many months.’He answered—"
"“伦敦比乡下好多了，更安全。最近这些年，法律变得更严酷，执法更严格。如果不是发生了意外，我就呆在那儿了。我本来决心留下，不再到乡下来。可是，发生了意外，我没法呆下去了。”","“London is better than the country, and safer, these late years, the laws be so bitter and so diligently enforced.An’ I had not had that accident, I had stayed there.I had resolved to stay, and never more venture country-wards—but the accident has ended that.”"
"他问现在帮里有多少人。这个“自傲自大的人”，或者叫首领的回答说：","He inquired how many persons the gang numbered now.The ‘ruffler,’ or chief, answered—"
"“加上女孩、娼妇和其他死了的，总共二十五个人，有强壮的、自夸的、、大块头的、狡猾的、灵牙利齿的，还有满嘴胡言的家伙。多数都在这儿，其他人正朝东部走，去过冬了。等黎明我们就跟上去。”","“Five and twenty sturdy budges, bulks, files, clapperdogeons and maunders, counting the dells and doxies and other morts.Most are here, the rest are wandering eastward, along the winter lay.We follow at dawn.”"
"“我在周围的老实人中没有看到温。他会在哪儿呢？”","“I do not see the Wen among the honest folk about me.Where may he be?”"
"“可怜的家伙，现在他吃的是硫磺，这对于他清淡的口味来说太重了。在一次打架中，他被打死了，大概仲夏的时候。”","“Poor lad, his diet is brimstone, now, and over hot for a delicate taste.He was killed in a brawl, somewhere about midsummer.”"
"“听到这件事，我感到很难过。温是个有能力的人，很勇敢。”","“I sorrow to hear that; the Wen was a capable man, and brave.”"
"“他确实是这样的。布莱克·贝丝，他的女儿，还是我们的一员，但正在往东走，现在不在这儿。她是个很好的小女孩，行为举止都很正经，没人见她一周喝酒超过四天的。”","“That was he, truly.Black Bess, his dell, is of us yet, but absent on the eastward tramp; a fine lass, of nice ways and orderly conduct, none ever seeing her drunk above four days in the seven.”"
"“她总是很严肃，我记得清清楚楚，确实是个好女孩，配得上所有的褒扬。她的母亲更放任些，不讲究，是个惹是生非、脾气不好的恶婆娘，但却有不同寻常的智慧。”","“She was ever strict—I remember it well—a goodly wench and worthy all commendation.Her mother was more free and less particular; a troublesome and ugly-tempered beldame, but furnished with a wit above the common.”"
"“正为此，我们失去了她。她看手相的天赋和那算命的本领终于让她落了个巫婆的名声。法律判决她在慢火上被烤死。她面对自己的命运英勇无畏，真的让我感动至极。她诅咒、辱骂围观她的目瞪口呆的人群，而这时，火苗向上吞卷了她的脸，烧到了她稀少的头发，在她那苍老的灰白色脑袋周围噼啪作响。她诅咒着那些人！你活一千年都听不到这样咄咄逼人的诅咒。呜呼，她的手艺随着她消失了。现在只剩些皮毛和差劲的模仿，却没有真正的通灵术。”","“We lost her through it.Her gift of palmistry and other sorts of fortune-telling begot for her at last a witch’s name and fame.The law roasted her to death at a slow fire.It did touch me to a sort of tenderness to see the gallant way she met her lot—cursing and reviling all the crowd that gaped and gazed around her, whilst the flames licked upward toward her face and catched her thin locks and crackled about her old gray head—cursing them! why an’ thou should’st live a thousand years thoud’st never hear so masterful a cursing.Alack, her art died with her.There be base and weakling imitations left, but no true blasphemy.”"
"首领叹了口气，听的人同情地叹了口气。一时间，沮丧笼罩了这群人，因为，即使像这些被遗弃的硬心肠的人，都没有完全丧失情感。在特别煽情的情景下，他们还是能偶尔感受到刹那的失落和苦恼，比如像现在这种天才离去而后继无人的情景。但是，一圈酒下去，大家喝了很多，又很快从悲伤的情绪中恢复过来。","The Ruffler sighed; the listeners sighed in sympathy; a general depression fell upon the company for a moment, for even hardened outcasts like these are not wholly dead to sentiment, but are able to feel a fleeting sense of loss and affliction at wide intervals and under peculiarly favouring circumstances—as in cases like to this, for instance, when genius and culture depart and leave no heir.However, a deep drink all round soon restored the spirits of the mourners."
"“我们的朋友还有吃不饱饭的吗？”霍布斯问。","“Have any others of our friends fared hardly?” asked Hobbs."
"“有些——是的。尤其是新来的，比如小农夫，因为自己的农场被拿去做羊群放牧场，他们只好混日子，忍饥挨饿。他们乞讨，在马车后被人鞭打，腰带以上光着，一直打到流血，然后被放到栓架上猛打。他们再乞讨，再被人鞭打，被割掉了一只耳朵。他们第三次去乞讨——可怜的家伙，他们还能做什么？他们脸颊上被用红热的烙铁烫了印，然后被当做奴隶卖了。他们逃跑，但又被追回来，然后给绞死。这是一个简短的故事，说起来很快。我们其他人都还算能吃饱。过来，约克尔、伯恩斯，还有霍奇，展示展示你们的饰品！”","“Some—yes.Particularly new comers—such as small husbandmen turned shiftless and hungry upon the world because their farms were taken from them to be changed to sheep ranges.They begged, and were whipped at the cart’s tail, naked from the girdle up, till the blood ran; then set in the stocks to be pelted; they begged again, were whipped again, and deprived of an ear; they begged a third time—poor devils, what else could they do?—and were branded on the cheek with a red-hot iron, then sold for slaves; they ran away, were hunted down, and hanged.’Tis a brief tale, and quickly told.Others of us have fared less hardly.Stand forth, Yokel, Burns, and Hodge—show your adornments!”"
"这几个人站起来，脱了破衣服，露出了他们的背，一条条鞭打留下的旧伤痕纵横交错。一个人撩起他的头发，露出了耳朵被割去的地方；另一个人展示了他肩膀上的烙着的字母V和一只残缺的耳朵；第三个人说：","These stood up and stripped away some of their rags, exposing their backs, criss-crossed with ropy old welts left by the lash; one turned up his hair and showed the place where a left ear had once been; another showed a brand upon his shoulder—the letter V—and a mutilated ear; the third said—"
"“我是约克尔，原来是个农夫，很富有，有心爱的妻子和孩子们。现在，我的财产和职业都发生了变化；妻子和孩子走了，或许他们在天堂，又或许在——在其他地方，只是感谢好心的上帝，他们不要在英国！我那善良无辜的老母亲，为了挣口饭吃而去照顾病人。其中一个病人死了，医生找不出死因，所以，我的母亲被当作巫婆烧死了，而我的孩子们看着，痛哭着。英国的法律！起来，所有人都起来，端起酒杯！一起喝，碰杯！为慈悲的英国法律干杯，它让她逃离了英国这个地狱！谢谢，伙计们，感谢你们所有人。我和我的妻子带着挨饿的孩子们挨家挨户地乞讨，但在英国，挨饿就是犯罪。因此，他们扒了我们的衣服，鞭打我们，追了我们三个镇。大家再为慈悲的英国法律干杯！因为，它的鞭打吸干了我的玛丽的血，它那赐福的解脱来得很快。她躺在那儿，躺在陶工场，逃离了所有伤害。孩子们——啊，我被从一个镇到另一个镇追着打的时候，他们在挨饿。喝，伙计们，只一口，为可怜的孩子们喝一口，他们从来没有伤害过他人。我又去乞讨——讨一点面包皮，却挨了打，还丢了一只耳朵——看，这儿还留着残余部分。我再去乞讨，这残余的部分提醒我要小心。我又去乞讨，结果被当奴隶卖了。看我脸上，这块污渍下面，如果我把污渍洗去，你们就可以看到烙铁印在那儿的红色字母S！奴隶！你们懂这个词吗？英国奴隶！他就站在你们的面前。我从主人那里逃跑，被抓到的时候，按照英国的法律规定的——愿老天狠狠地诅咒英国的法律！——我将被绞死！”","“I am Yokel, once a farmer and prosperous, with loving wife and kids—now am I somewhat different in estate and calling; and the wife and kids are gone; mayhap they are in heaven, mayhap in—in the other place—but the kindly God be thanked, they bide no more in ENGLAND!My good old blameless mother strove to earn bread by nursing the sick; one of these died, the doctors knew not how, so my mother was burnt for a witch, whilst my babes looked on and wailed.English law!—up, all, with your cups!—now all together and with a cheer!—drink to the merciful English law that delivered HER from the English hell!Thank you, mates, one and all.I begged, from house to house—I and the wife—bearing with us the hungry kids—but it was crime to be hungry in England—so they stripped us and lashed us through three towns.Drink ye all again to the merciful English law!—for its lash drank deep of my Mary’s blood and its blessed deliverance came quick.She lies there, in the potter’s field, safe from all harms.And the kids—well, whilst the law lashed me from town to town, they starved.Drink, lads—only a drop—a drop to the poor kids, that never did any creature harm.I begged again—begged, for a crust, and got the stocks and lost an ear—see, here bides the stump; I begged again, and here is the stump of the other to keep me minded of it.And still I begged again, and was sold for a slave—here on my cheek under this stain, if I washed it off, ye might see the red S the branding-iron left there!A SLAVE!Do you understand that word?An English SLAVE!—that is he that stands before ye.I have run from my master, and when I am found—the heavy curse of heaven fall on the law of the land that hath commanded it!—I shall hang!”"
"一个响亮的声音穿过黑暗的空气：","A ringing voice came through the murky air—"
"“你不会的！从今天开始，这样的法律结束了！”","“Thou shalt NOT!—and this day the end of that law is come!”"
"众人都扭过头，看到一个怪诞的人影，是小国王急匆匆走过来了。人影走到灯光下，清楚地展现在众人面前了，于是大家都开始询问：","All turned, and saw the fantastic figure of the little King approaching hurriedly; as it emerged into the light and was clearly revealed, a general explosion of inquiries broke out—"
"“这是谁？这是什么人？你是谁，小矮人？”","“Who is it?What is it?Who art thou, manikin?”"
"男孩站在那么多双惊讶和疑惑的眼睛中间，十分镇静，以王室的高贵回答道：“我是爱德华，英国国王。”","The boy stood unconfused in the midst of all those surprised and questioning eyes, and answered with princely dignity—“I am Edward, King of England.”"
"这引起了哄堂大笑，一半是嘲笑，一半是被这个绝好的玩笑给逗乐了。国王被刺痛了。他尖声说道：","A wild burst of laughter followed, partly of derision and partly of delight in the excellence of the joke.The King was stung.He said sharply—"
"“你们这些无礼的游民，我允诺赐予你们皇家的恩惠，这就是你们的回报吗？”","“Ye mannerless vagrants, is this your recognition of the royal boon I have promised?”"
"他还说了更多，声音里满是愤怒，手势里满是激动，但全都淹没在那一片大笑声和嘲弄声中了。喧闹中，“约翰·霍布斯”好几次努力想让大家听到他说话，最后终于成功了。他说：","He said more, with angry voice and excited gesture, but it was lost in a whirlwind of laughter and mocking exclamations.‘John Hobbs’ made several attempts to make himself heard above the din, and at last succeeded—saying—"
"“伙计们，他是我儿子，一个做梦的人，一个傻瓜，彻底疯了。别理他，他以为自己是国王。”","“Mates, he is my son, a dreamer, a fool, and stark mad—mind him not—he thinketh he IS the King.”"
"“我是国王，”爱德华转向他说道，“你迟早会受到惩罚的。你承认你杀了人，你将会因此被绞死。”","“I am the King,” said Edward, turning toward him, “as thou shalt know to thy cost, in good time.Thou hast confessed a murder—thou shalt swing for it.”"
"“你要出卖我？你？看我揍你——”","“THOU’LT betray me?—THOU?An’ I get my hands upon thee—”"
"“嘘！”魁梧的首领及时插话，救了国王，还拿拳头把霍布斯推倒了：“不尊重国王，也不尊重首领？你再无视我的存在，我就自己把你绞死。”接着他对陛下说：“你不能威胁你的同伴，小子。你必须管住你的嘴巴，不能在其他地方说他们的坏话。做国王吧，如果这样能安慰你疯癫的情绪，但你不能害人。别乱说你是国王，那是烦了叛国罪。我们在些微不足道的事情上是坏人，但是我们都没有恶劣到背叛国王。这一点上，我们有仁爱和忠诚的心。听着，我说的都是心里话。现在，大家一起说：‘英国国王爱德华万岁！’”“英国国王爱德华万岁！”","“Tut-tut!” said the burley Ruffler, interposing in time to save the King, and emphasising this service by knocking Hobbs down with his fist, “hast respect for neither Kings NOR Rufflers?An’ thou insult my presence so again, I’ll hang thee up myself.”Then he said to his Majesty, “Thou must make no threats against thy mates, lad; and thou must guard thy tongue from saying evil of them elsewhere.BE King, if it please thy mad humour, but be not harmful in it.Sink the title thou hast uttered—’tis treason; we be bad men in some few trifling ways, but none among us is so base as to be traitor to his King; we be loving and loyal hearts, in that regard.Note if I speak truth.Now—all together: ‘Long live Edward, King of England!’”“LONG LIVE EDWARD, KING OF ENGLAND!”"
"成分混杂的乞丐们都跟着喊，声音像暴雨一般，这间疯狂的屋子随着它震动了。一时间，小国王的脸上充满了欣喜之色，他轻轻点了点头，极其自然地低声答道：","The response came with such a thundergust from the motley crew that the crazy building vibrated to the sound.The little King’s face lighted with pleasure for an instant, and he slightly inclined his head, and said with grave simplicity—"
"“谢谢，我善良的子民们。”","“I thank you, my good people.”"
"意想不到的回答逗得大家哄堂大笑起来。不一会儿，大家又都恢复安静的时候，首领坚定地，带着听得出的好意说道：","This unexpected result threw the company into convulsions of merriment.When something like quiet was presently come again, the Ruffler said, firmly, but with an accent of good nature—"
"“别玩这个了，孩子，这不明智，也不好玩。如果你必须幻想，你可以，但选个别的头衔。”","“Drop it, boy, ’tis not wise, nor well.Humour thy fancy, if thou must, but choose some other title.”"
"一个补锅匠给出了建议，他尖声说：","A tinker shrieked out a suggestion—"
"“佛佛一世，傻瓜们的国王！”","“Foo-foo the First, King of the Mooncalves!”"
"这个头衔立刻被‘采纳’了，众人都扯着嗓子喊，声音震天：","The title ‘took,’ at once, every throat responded, and a roaring shout went up, of—"
"“傻瓜的国王佛佛一世万岁！”紧接着是一片叫喊、嘘声和阵阵笑声。","“Long live Foo-foo the First, King of the Mooncalves!” followed by hootings, cat-calls, and peals of laughter."
"“把他拉过来，给他加冕！”","“Hale him forth, and crown him!”"
"“给他穿上长袍！”","“Robe him!”"
"“授予他节杖！”","“Sceptre him!”"
"“让他登上宝座！”","“Throne him!”"
"二十多个人立刻同那人一起喊了出来！可怜的小受害者几乎还没来得及出口气，就被戴上了个锡制的盆子，裹上了破烂的毯子，坐在了一只木桶宝座上，授予了补锅匠的烙铁——就是节杖。随后,众人都跪拜在他周围，一齐讽刺地哭号、嘲弄地哀求起来，还用脏兮兮的、破破烂烂的袖子和围裙擦自己的眼睛：","These and twenty other cries broke out at once!and almost before the poor little victim could draw a breath he was crowned with a tin basin, robed in a tattered blanket, throned upon a barrel, and sceptred with the tinker’s soldering-iron.Then all flung themselves upon their knees about him and sent up a chorus of ironical wailings, and mocking supplications, whilst they swabbed their eyes with their soiled and ragged sleeves and aprons—"
"“可怜可怜我们，啊，好心的国王！”","“Be gracious to us, O sweet King!”"
"“不要践踏向您恳求的可怜虫，啊，高贵的陛下！”","“Trample not upon thy beseeching worms, O noble Majesty!”"
"“同情您的奴隶吧，多给些赏金安慰他们！”","“Pity thy slaves, and comfort them with a royal kick!”"
"“用您仁慈的光辉鼓舞我们，温暖我们，啊，君主是燃烧的太阳！”","“Cheer us and warm us with thy gracious rays, O flaming sun of sovereignty!”"
"“让您的足迹来洗清大地的罪孽，这样我们就能吃一把泥土，然后变成贵族！”","“Sanctify the ground with the touch of thy foot, that we may eat the dirt and be ennobled!”"
"“您屈尊向我们吐口唾沫吧，啊，陛下，好让我们的孩子的孩子讲述您高贵的屈尊，永远感到骄傲和幸福！”","“Deign to spit upon us, O Sire, that our children’s children may tell of thy princely condescension, and be proud and happy for ever!”"
"不过，滑稽的补锅匠创造了夜晚的“高潮”，摘得了桂冠。他跪下，假装亲吻国王的脚、却被愤怒地踢开。于是，他到处乞讨一块破布，好用来遮盖脸上被脚踢过的地方，说必须保护它，防止它与粗俗的空气接触，还说他应该到公路上展示它，看一眼收一百先令， 这样就发财了。他成为如此迷人的搞笑人物，脏兮兮的乌合之众都对他十分羡慕、钦佩。","But the humorous tinker made the ‘hit’ of the evening and carried off the honours.Kneeling, he pretended to kiss the King’s foot, and was indignantly spurned; whereupon he went about begging for a rag to paste over the place upon his face which had been touched by the foot, saying it must be preserved from contact with the vulgar air, and that he should make his fortune by going on the highway and exposing it to view at the rate of a hundred shillings a sight.He made himself so killingly funny that he was the envy and admiration of the whole mangy rabble."
"小君主的眼睛里闪着羞辱和愤怒的泪花，他心里想：“如果我对他们做了十分不公的事，他们也只不过这样残忍了。可是，我给他们的只有仁慈，他们却这样对待我！”","Tears of shame and indignation stood in the little monarch’s eyes; and the thought in his heart was, “Had I offered them a deep wrong they could not be more cruel—yet have I proffered nought but to do them a kindness—and it is thus they use me for it!”"
"第十八章 国君和流浪汉们","Chapter XVIII  The Prince with the Tramps"
"流浪大军一大早就起床，踏上了他们的征程。头顶上的 天空很低，脚下的大地很泥泞，冬天的空气冷飕飕的。众人早已没了欢乐的情绪，有的闷闷不乐、沉默不语，有的急躁易怒，没有一个心情温和，个个口干舌燥。","The troop of vagabonds turned out at early dawn, and set forward on their march.There was a lowering sky overhead, sloppy ground under foot, and a winter chill in the air.All gaiety was gone from the company; some were sullen and silent, some were irritable and petulant, none were gentle-humoured, all were thirsty."
"首领把“杰克”交给雨果照看，并简单叮嘱了几句，命令约翰·坎蒂离他远点，别去管他，同时也警告雨果不要对小家伙太粗鲁。","The Ruffler put ‘Jack’ in Hugo’s charge, with some brief instructions, and commanded John Canty to keep away from him and let him alone; he also warned Hugo not to be too rough with the lad."
"过了会儿，天气变得缓和了些，云也散了些。大军不再哆嗦，他们的精神也开始好转。他们越来越欢快，后来开始彼此交谈，辱骂马路上的过路人。这就证明他们又恢复了对生活及其乐趣的欣赏。他们这些人给人的恐惧感是显而易见的，因为人人都给他们让路，温顺地听着他们那粗俗、傲慢的言语，不敢回嘴。他们隔着树篱抢亚麻，有时就当着主人的面，主人也不反抗，只是似乎在感激他们没有连树篱也抢走。","After a while the weather grew milder, and the clouds lifted somewhat.The troop ceased to shiver, and their spirits began to improve.They grew more and more cheerful, and finally began to chaff each other and insult passengers along the highway.This showed that they were awaking to an appreciation of life and its joys once more.The dread in which their sort was held was apparent in the fact that everybody gave them the road, and took their ribald insolences meekly, without venturing to talk back.They snatched linen from the hedges, occasionally in full view of the owners, who made no protest, but only seemed grateful that they did not take the hedges, too."
"不久，他们占领了一个小农舍，当成自己的家。而哆哆嗦嗦的农夫和他的亲人清空了食品橱，为他们做了一顿丰盛的早餐。他们一边从主妇和她的女儿们的手里接过食物，一边抚弄她们的下巴，拿她们开粗俗的玩笑，伴随着侮辱的言辞和阵阵狂笑。他们朝农夫和他的儿子们扔骨头和蔬菜，让他们一直躲闪，每当打个正着的时候，就喧闹着鼓掌。最后，他们把其中一个女儿的头上涂了黄油，因为她对他们的胡作非为表现出了愤怒。他们走的时候还威胁说，如果有人把他们的行为报告到官方的耳朵里，他们会回来，并把这家人头顶上的房屋烧了。","By-and-by they invaded a small farmhouse and made themselves at home while the trembling farmer and his people swept the larder clean to furnish a breakfast for them.They chucked the housewife and her daughters under the chin whilst receiving the food from their hands, and made coarse jests about them, accompanied with insulting epithets and bursts of horse-laughter.They threw bones and vegetables at the farmer and his sons, kept them dodging all the time, and applauded uproariously when a good hit was made.They ended by buttering the head of one of the daughters who resented some of their familiarities.When they took their leave they threatened to come back and burn the house over the heads of the family if any report of their doings got to the ears of the authorities."
"经过辛苦的长途跋涉，大约中午时，这帮人在一个大村庄郊外的树篱后面停了下来。他们有一小时的休息时间，然后他们散开，从不同的地方进入这个村庄，各自干起不通的勾当。“杰克”跟雨果分到一组。有好一会儿，他们俩这儿走走，那儿走走，雨果在寻找下手的机会，但没有找到。于是，他终于说：","About noon, after a long and weary tramp, the gang came to a halt behind a hedge on the outskirts of a considerable village.An hour was allowed for rest, then the crew scattered themselves abroad to enter the village at different points to ply their various trades—‘Jack’ was sent with Hugo.They wandered hither and thither for some time, Hugo watching for opportunities to do a stroke of business, but finding none—so he finally said—"
"“我没看到有什么可以偷的，这是个穷地方。所以,我们就讨饭吧。”","“I see nought to steal; it is a paltry place.Wherefore we will beg.”"
"“我们，真是的！你去讨吧，你适合这行。但我不会去乞讨。”","“WE, forsooth!Follow thy trade—it befits thee.But-I-will not beg.”"
"“你不乞讨！”雨果大声喊道，眼睛惊讶地盯着国王,“拜托，你什么时候洗心革面了？”","“Thou’lt not beg!” exclaimed Hugo, eyeing the King with surprise.“Prithee, since when hast thou reformed?”"
"“你这话什么意思？”","“What dost thou mean?”"
"“意思？你不是在伦敦街上讨饭长大的吗？”","“Mean?Hast thou not begged the streets of London all thy life?”"
"“我？你个笨蛋！”","“I?Thou idiot!”"
"“省省你那恭维的话，你的名声会留得更长久些。你父亲说你从来都在讨饭。可能是他撒谎。也许你非常大胆，敢说他在撒谎。”雨果嘲笑道。","“Spare thy compliments—thy stock will last the longer.Thy father says thou hast begged all thy days.Mayhap he lied.Peradventure you will even make so bold as to say he lied,” scoffed Hugo."
"“你说他是我父亲？是的，他撒谎。”","“Him you call my father?Yes, he lied.”"
"“过来，别再玩你那疯子的游戏了。你可以拿它来当玩笑，但不可以拿来害自己。如果我告诉他，他会为这个把你好好地烤了。”","“Come, play not thy merry game of madman so far, mate; use it for thy amusement, not thy hurt.An’ I tell him this, he will scorch thee finely for it.”"
"“不用麻烦你。我会告诉他。”","“Save thyself the trouble.I will tell him.”"
"“我喜欢你的勇气，真的喜欢，但我不敢恭维你的判断力。你不用特意去招惹，人生里就已经有够多的严刑拷打了。不过，不讨论这些事了，我——相信你父亲。我不怀疑他会说谎，我不怀疑他有时候确实说谎，因为我们这些人多数都说谎，但是，在这件事上他不会。一个聪明人不会为了没用的东西而撒谎。但你过来，既然你不想乞讨，我们从哪儿下手呢？抢厨房？”","“I like thy spirit, I do in truth; but I do not admire thy judgment.Bone-rackings and bastings be plenty enow in this life, without going out of one’s way to invite them.But a truce to these matters; I—— believe your father.I doubt not he can lie; I doubt not he doth lie, upon occasion, for the best of us do that; but there is no occasion here.A wise man does not waste so good a commodity as lying for nought.But come; sith it is thy humour to give over begging, wherewithal shall we busy ourselves?With robbing kitchens?”"
"国王不耐烦地说道：","The King said, impatiently—"
"“你这愚蠢的想法有完没完，我烦了！”","“Have done with this folly—you weary me!”"
"雨果动了脾气，回道：","Hugo replied, with temper—"
"“现在，听着，伙计：你不讨饭，你也不偷，那好。但是，我告诉你该做什么。你要在我讨饭的时候扮演诱饵。拒绝，你以为你有选择吗！”","“Now harkee, mate; you will not beg, you will not rob; so be it.But I will tell you what you WILL do.You will play decoy whilst I beg.Refuse, an’ you think you may venture!”"
"国王刚要轻蔑地答话，雨果打断他说：","The King was about to reply contemptuously, when Hugo said, interrupting—"
"“安静！来了个面善的人。现在，我要抽筋倒下了。这个陌生人向我跑过来时，你就哭，跪在地上，装哭泣，然后，你得又哭又喊，好像所有悲惨的魔鬼都在你肚子里似的。你说：‘啊，先生，这是我可怜的、受尽折磨的哥哥，我们无依无靠。啊，看在上帝的份上，用您慈悲的眼睛同情地看一眼这个得病、被遗弃、最可怜的、不幸的人吧，从您的财富中拿出一小便士，施舍给这个受尽折磨、将要死亡的人！’记住，要一直哭，不要停，直到我们骗到他的钱，否则有你好看的。”","“Peace!Here comes one with a kindly face.Now will I fall down in a fit.When the stranger runs to me, set you up a wail, and fall upon your knees, seeming to weep; then cry out as all the devils of misery were in your belly, and say, ‘Oh, sir, it is my poor afflicted brother, and we be friendless; o’ God’s name cast through your merciful eyes one pitiful look upon a sick, forsaken, and most miserable wretch; bestow one little penny out of thy riches upon one smitten of God and ready to perish!’—and mind you, keep you ON wailing, and abate not till we bilk him of his penny, else shall you rue it.”"
"接着，雨果马上开始呻吟，叹息，翻眼睛，脚步蹒跚，跌跌撞撞地四处走。那个陌生人走到跟前时，他一声尖叫，四肢伸展地倒在他前面，开始在土里扭动、翻滚，看起来十分痛苦。","Then immediately Hugo began to moan, and groan, and roll his eyes, and reel and totter about; and when the stranger was close at hand, down he sprawled before him, with a shriek, and began to writhe and wallow in the dirt, in seeming agony."
"“啊，亲爱的，啊，亲爱的！”好心肠的陌生人喊道，“啊，可怜的家伙，可怜的家伙，他遭受着怎样的痛苦！好了，我来帮你站起来。”","“O, dear, O dear!” cried the benevolent stranger, “O poor soul, poor soul, how he doth suffer!There—let me help thee up.”"
"“啊，高尚的先生，不要，上帝爱你这样高贵的绅士。但是，我抽筋的时候，如果有人碰我，就疼得要命。那儿，我弟弟会告诉阁下，我抽筋的时候，是如何受尽了痛苦的折磨。一便士，亲爱的先生，给一便士吧，让我们买点吃的，您就不用管我的痛苦了。”","“O noble sir, forbear, and God love you for a princely gentleman—but it giveth me cruel pain to touch me when I am taken so.My brother there will tell your worship how I am racked with anguish when these fits be upon me.A penny, dear sir, a penny, to buy a little food; then leave me to my sorrows.”"
"“一便士！给你三个，你这倒霉的家伙。”他急急忙忙地在从口袋里摸索着掏了钱出来，“给，可怜的人，拿着，不用客气。现在，过来，我的孩子，帮我把你受苦的哥哥抬到你家，你家在哪儿——”","“A penny!thou shalt have three, thou hapless creature,”—and he fumbled in his pocket with nervous haste and got them out.“There, poor lad, take them and most welcome.Now come hither, my boy, and help me carry thy stricken brother to yon house, where—”"
"“我不是他弟弟。”国王打断他说道。","“I am not his brother,” said the King, interrupting."
"“什么！不是他弟弟？”","“What! not his brother?”"
"“噢，听他瞎说！”雨果呻吟道，然后暗暗咬牙切齿，“他不认自己的哥哥，因为他哥哥一只脚已经踏进了坟墓！”","“Oh, hear him!” groaned Hugo, then privately ground his teeth.“He denies his own brother—and him with one foot in the grave!”"
"“孩子，如果他真是你哥哥，你的心肠可真硬。我为你感到羞愧！他的手脚几乎不能动弹了。如果他不是你哥哥，那他是谁？”","“Boy, thou art indeed hard of heart, if this is thy brother.For shame!—and he scarce able to move hand or foot.If he is not thy brother, who is he, then?”"
"“一个乞丐，小偷！他已经得到你施舍的钱，还扒窃了你的口袋。你将会制造一个康复奇迹，你把你的东西放在这家伙的肩膀上，剩下的靠天意就行了。”","“A beggar and a thief!He has got your money and has picked your pocket likewise.An’ thou would’st do a healing miracle, lay thy staff over his shoulders and trust Providence for the rest.”"
"不过，雨果没等着这个奇迹发生。他立刻站起来，像风一样跑了。绅士在后面一面穷追不舍，一面大喊大叫。国王获得了自由，十分感谢老天爷。他向相反的方向逃去，不敢放慢脚步，直到确定逃离了危险。他踏上出现在跟前的第一条路，很快就把村庄抛在身后了。他急匆匆地往前走，脚步尽可能地轻快。好几个小时，他都在紧张地往身后看，怕被追上来。但是，他终于不害怕了，取而代之的是感激的安全感。他现在意识到自己饿了，也非常疲惫。于是，他停在一家农舍前。可是，他正要开口说话就被打断了，而且被粗暴地赶走了。他穿的衣服对他不利。","But Hugo did not tarry for the miracle.In a moment he was up and off like the wind, the gentleman following after and raising the hue and cry lustily as he went.The King, breathing deep gratitude to Heaven for his own release, fled in the opposite direction, and did not slacken his pace until he was out of harm’s reach.He took the first road that offered, and soon put the village behind him.He hurried along, as briskly as he could, during several hours, keeping a nervous watch over his shoulder for pursuit; but his fears left him at last, and a grateful sense of security took their place.He recognised, now, that he was hungry, and also very tired.So he halted at a farmhouse; but when he was about to speak, he was cut short and driven rudely away.His clothes were against him."
"他带着伤继续走，心里也很生气，下定决心不再将自己置于相似的境地中。但是，饥饿是自尊的主人。于是，傍晚即将来临时，他又到另一家农舍讨饭。可是，他这次的遭遇比上次更差，因为人家叫他叫得很难听，而且还说，如果他不快点走开，一定会把他当游民给抓起来。","He wandered on, wounded and indignant, and was resolved to put himself in the way of like treatment no more.But hunger is pride’s master; so, as the evening drew near, he made an attempt at another farmhouse; but here he fared worse than before; for he was called hard names and was promised arrest as a vagrant except he moved on promptly."
"夜晚到了，天又冷又阴，国王的脚又酸又痛，却仍慢慢地往前走。他不得不一直走，因为每次他坐下来休息，寒冷很快就刺透了他的骨头。他在肃穆阴沉而又空寂辽阔的夜晚中行走，对于他来说，所有的感受和体会都是新鲜、陌生的。他时不时听到有说话声渐近，经过他，然后又归于平静，可他看不到发出说话声的人，只看到一些无形中飘动的模糊之物，是像幽灵一般的怪东西，吓得他直发抖。有时，他突然看到闪烁的光线，距离显然很远，几乎来自另一个世界。即使他能听到羊群叮当的铃声，也都很模糊、遥远、不清楚。牛群低沉的叫声随着夜晚的风飘到他耳朵里，抑扬顿挫，直到消失，声声哀怨。偶尔传来几声狗的嚎叫，抱怨着森林和田野那无边无际的广阔。所有声音都很遥远，这使得小国王觉得他与一切生命和活动隔绝，在无边的荒地中孤独无依地站着。","The night came on, chilly and overcast; and still the footsore monarch laboured slowly on.He was obliged to keep moving, for every time he sat down to rest he was soon penetrated to the bone with the cold.All his sensations and experiences, as he moved through the solemn gloom and the empty vastness of the night, were new and strange to him.At intervals he heard voices approach, pass by, and fade into silence; and as he saw nothing more of the bodies they belonged to than a sort of formless drifting blur, there was something spectral and uncanny about it all that made him shudder.Occasionally he caught the twinkle of a light—always far away, apparently—almost in another world; if he heard the tinkle of a sheep’s bell, it was vague, distant, indistinct; the muffled lowing of the herds floated to him on the night wind in vanishing cadences, a mournful sound; now and then came the complaining howl of a dog over viewless expanses of field and forest; all sounds were remote; they made the little King feel that all life and activity were far removed from him, and that he stood solitary, companionless, in the centre of a measureless solitude."
"他蹒跚地走着，感受着新的感受中可怕的魔力。头顶上干枯的叶子轻柔地沙沙作响，听着十分像人在窃窃私语，时不时地把他吓一跳。不一会儿，他突然走到一片斑驳的灯光下，近处有一个锡制的灯笼。他退回到阴影里等待着。灯笼挂在一个仓房的门口，门开着。国王等了一会儿，没有声音，没有人出现。他静静地站着，冻得冰凉，那舒适的仓房看着那么诱人，终于他决定冒险进去。他开始快速地、蹑手蹑脚地走过去，正要迈过门槛，忽然听到背后有说话声。他急忙躲到仓房的一个酒桶后面，俯下身来。两个农夫拿着那灯笼走了进来，他们开始边干活，边聊天。他们拿着灯走动时，国王到处看了看，看到仓房另一头好像是个很大的畜栏，他想等剩他一个人时就摸到那头去。他还注意到一堆鞍褥，就在走道中间的位置，便有意将其拿过来为英国国王效劳一宿。","He stumbled along, through the gruesome fascinations of this new experience, startled occasionally by the soft rustling of the dry leaves overhead, so like human whispers they seemed to sound; and by-and-by he came suddenly upon the freckled light of a tin lantern near at hand.He stepped back into the shadows and waited.The lantern stood by the open door of a barn.The King waited some time—there was no sound, and nobody stirring.He got so cold, standing still, and the hospitable barn looked so enticing, that at last he resolved to risk everything and enter.He started swiftly and stealthily, and just as he was crossing the threshold he heard voices behind him.He darted behind a cask, within the barn, and stooped down.Two farm-labourers came in, bringing the lantern with them, and fell to work, talking meanwhile.Whilst they moved about with the light, the King made good use of his eyes and took the bearings of what seemed to be a good-sized stall at the further end of the place, purposing to grope his way to it when he should be left to himself.He also noted the position of a pile of horse blankets, midway of the route, with the intent to levy upon them for the service of the crown of England for one night."
"没多久，农夫干完活，将身后的门关紧，便提着灯笼离开了。发抖的国王在黑暗中以最快的速度冲向鞍褥，把它们抱起来，摸索着，安全到达了畜栏。他用两个鞍褥当床，然后用剩下的两个当被子盖上。他现在是个高兴的君王了，尽管鞍褥又旧又薄，而且不够暖和，还散发出马的刺鼻的气味，强烈得几乎让人窒息。","By-and-by the men finished and went away, fastening the door behind them and taking the lantern with them.The shivering King made for the blankets, with as good speed as the darkness would allow; gathered them up, and then groped his way safely to the stall.Of two of the blankets he made a bed, then covered himself with the remaining two.He was a glad monarch, now, though the blankets were old and thin, and not quite warms enough; and besides gave out a pungent horsey odour that was almost suffocatingly powerful."
"国王虽然饥寒交迫，也困乏难当，而困乏很快战胜了饥寒，他不一会儿就打起瞌睡，进入了半梦半醒的状态。随后，他正要完全睡着时，明显地感到有什么东西碰了他一下！他马上完全醒了，吸了口气。黑暗里，那神秘的碰触吓得他发冷，心脏都几乎停止了跳动。他一动不动地躺着，听着，几乎不敢呼吸。但是没什么动静，也没有声音。他接着听着，等着，似乎过了很长时间，但仍然没有动静，也没有声音。于是，他终于又开始打瞌睡。突然，他又感到那个神秘的触碰！在这个无声的、看不见的地方，轻轻的一下触碰真是可怕的事情，这让男孩子想到了鬼，恐惧至极。他该怎么做？这是个问题，但他不知道怎么回答。他应该离开这个相当舒适的窝，飞速逃离这神秘的令人恐惧的东西吗？可是，逃到哪里去？他出不了仓房，想要在黑暗中到处乱跑，也出不了这四堵墙，要是还有鬼魂飘在他后面，老是吓人地轻轻蹭你的脸颊或肩膀一下，真是让人受不了。但是，呆在这儿不动，一整夜活受罪，这样更好吗？不。那，还有什么其他办法？啊，只有一种办法。他明白了，他要伸手去找那个东西！","Although the King was hungry and chilly, he was also so tired and so drowsy that these latter influences soon began to get the advantage of the former, and he presently dozed off into a state of semi-consciousness.Then, just as he was on the point of losing himself wholly, he distinctly felt something touch him!He was broad awake in a moment, and gasping for breath.The cold horror of that mysterious touch in the dark almost made his heart stand still.He lay motionless, and listened, scarcely breathing.But nothing stirred, and there was no sound.He continued to listen, and wait, during what seemed a long time, but still nothing stirred, and there was no sound.So he began to drop into a drowse once more, at last; and all at once he felt that mysterious touch again!It was a grisly thing, this light touch from this noiseless and invisible presence; it made the boy sick with ghostly fears.What should he do?That was the question; but he did not know how to answer it.Should he leave these reasonably comfortable quarters and fly from this inscrutable horror?But fly whither?He could not get out of the barn; and the idea of scurrying blindly hither and thither in the dark, within the captivity of the four walls, with this phantom gliding after him, and visiting him with that soft hideous touch upon cheek or shoulder at every turn, was intolerable.But to stay where he was, and endure this living death all night—was that better?No.What, then, was there left to do?Ah, there was but one course; he knew it well—he must put out his hand and find that thing!"
"想到这一点很容易，但要鼓起勇气去尝试却很困难。他三次小心地将手往黑暗中伸出一点，可都猛地迅速缩回去了，倒吸一口气——不是因为他摸到了什么东西，而是他觉得他肯定就要摸到它了。但是，第四次，他摸索得更远一点，然后他的手轻轻地抚摸到了什么又软又暖的东西。他几乎被吓傻了。他的思维状态让他想到的只有刚刚死去的，还热乎乎的尸体，不可能是别的。他觉得自己宁可去死，也不再去摸它。但是，他有这个错误的想法是因为他不明白，人类的好奇心的力量是永生不灭的。不一会儿，他的手又颤抖着摸索起来。这与自己的想法相悖，没有得到自己的同意，而只是继续向前摸。手碰到了一束长长的毛，他吓得抖了一下，但顺着毛摸下去，他似乎是摸到了一条暖暖的绳子。顺着绳子，他摸到了一头无辜的小牛！——因为这绳子根本不是绳子，而是小牛的尾巴。","It was easy to think this; but it was hard to brace himself up to try it.Three times he stretched his hand a little way out into the dark, gingerly; and snatched it suddenly back, with a gasp—not because it had encountered anything, but because he had felt so sure it was just going to.But the fourth time, he groped a little further, and his hand lightly swept against something soft and warm.This petrified him, nearly, with fright; his mind was in such a state that he could imagine the thing to be nothing else than a corpse, newly dead and still warm.He thought he would rather die than touch it again.But he thought this false thought because he did not know the immortal strength of human curiosity.In no long time his hand was tremblingly groping again—against his judgment and without his consent— but groping persistently on, just the same.It encountered a bunch of long hair; he shuddered, but followed up the hair and found what seemed to be a warm rope; followed up the rope and found an innocent calf!—for the rope was not a rope at all, but the calf’s tail."
"国王从心里为自己感到羞耻，竟因为一头睡着的小牛这样微不足道的东西而害怕、苦恼。不过，他不必为此自责，因为他不是害怕小牛，而是把小牛当成了什么可怕的、不存在的东西。在那个迷信的时代，任何一个男孩都会像他一样害怕和煎熬。","The King was cordially ashamed of himself for having gotten all that fright and misery out of so paltry a matter as a slumbering calf; but he need not have felt so about it, for it was not the calf that frightened him, but a dreadful non-existent something which the calf stood for; and any other boy, in those old superstitious times, would have acted and suffered just as he had done."
"国王很高兴，不仅因为发现那东西不过是一头小牛，还因为他有了小牛做伴，因为他一直觉得那么孤独而且无依无靠，即使这样卑微的动物陪他，做他的朋友，他也很欢迎。他遭到自己同类一次又一次的打击和粗鲁的对待，而现在，他终于到了动物朋友的世界，他真的感到安慰。尽管它没有高贵的品质，至少它有一颗温柔的心和温和的脾气。所以，他决定放下地位，与小牛做朋友。","The King was not only delighted to find that the creature was only a calf, but delighted to have the calf’s company; for he had been feeling so lonesome and friendless that the company and comradeship of even this humble animal were welcome.And he had been so buffeted, so rudely entreated by his own kind, that it was a real comfort to him to feel that he was at last in the society of a fellow-creature that had at least a soft heart and a gentle spirit, whatever loftier attributes might be lacking.So he resolved to waive rank and make friends with the calf."
"他轻抚着它光滑、温暖的后背，因为它离他很近，很容易够着。这时他想到，这头小牛的作用可不止一种。于是，他重新铺了铺床，把它摊在离小牛很近的地面上，然后他挨着小牛的背蜷缩成一团，把盖着的东西拽过来，盖上自己和他的朋友。一两分钟后，他就觉得和以前他在威斯敏斯特皇宫里的绒毛沙发上睡一样暖和、舒适。","While stroking its sleek warm back—for it lay near him and within easy reach—it occurred to him that this calf might be utilised in more ways than one.Whereupon he re-arranged his bed, spreading it down close to the calf; then he cuddled himself up to the calf’s back, drew the covers up over himself and his friend, and in a minute or two was as warm and comfortable as he had ever been in the downy couches of the regal palace of Westminster."
"他马上想起了高兴的事，生活似乎愉快了许多。他逃离了劳役和犯罪的枷锁，逃离了低劣、野蛮的亡命之徒们。他很暖和，有了挡风避雨之处——一句话，他很高兴。夜晚的风越来越大，一阵阵地刮过来，使得旧仓房摇摇晃晃，格格作响。然后，时不时地，风又慢慢变小，在角落里和突起的地方呻吟、哭号。但是，这对国王来说就是音乐，因为他现在温暖而舒适。就让它肆虐地吹吧，刮吧，让它击打吧，撞击吧，让它呻吟吧，哀号吧——他不在意，他只是听得很高兴。他只是紧紧地依偎着他的朋友，满足于温暖奢侈的享受中，意识幸福地飘走了，他进入了沉沉的睡眠中。没有梦的打扰，只有安详和平静。远处的狗在狂吠，忧郁的母牛在抱怨，风继续肆虐地刮着，暴雨还刷刷地敲打着屋顶。可是，英国陛下没有被惊扰，仍在睡着，小牛也一样。它是简单的生物，不容易被暴风雨惊扰，与国王一块儿睡也不容易感到尴尬。","Pleasant thoughts came at once; life took on a cheerfuller seeming.He was free of the bonds of servitude and crime, free of the companionship of base and brutal outlaws; he was warm; he was sheltered; in a word, he was happy.The night wind was rising; it swept by in fitful gusts that made the old barn quake and rattle, then its forces died down at intervals, and went moaning and wailing around corners and projections—but it was all music to the King, now that he was snug and comfortable: let it blow and rage, let it batter and bang, let it moan and wail, he minded it not, he only enjoyed it.He merely snuggled the closer to his friend, in a luxury of warm contentment, and drifted blissfully out of consciousness into a deep and dreamless sleep that was full of serenity and peace.The distant dogs howled, the melancholy kine complained, and the winds went on raging, whilst furious sheets of rain drove along the roof; but the Majesty of England slept on, undisturbed, and the calf did the same, it being a simple creature, and not easily troubled by storms or embarrassed by sleeping with a king."
"第十九章 国君和农夫们","Chapter XIX  The Prince with the Peasants"
"国王一大早醒来时，发现昨天晚上，有一只湿漉漉的却小心提防的老鼠爬到了这里，在他的胸膛前温暖舒适地睡了一觉。现在它被惊醒，仓惶逃走了。男孩子笑了，说道：“可怜的傻瓜，为什么这么害怕？我像你一样孤单。我不可能去伤害无助的东西，像我一样无助的东西。而且，我还没感谢你给我带来了一个好兆头呢。因为，当一个国王落魄到老鼠都能在他身上睡觉时，就肯定意味着他要转运了，因为他显然不可能比这会儿更落魄了。”","When the King awoke in the early morning, he found that a wet but thoughtful rat had crept into the place during the night and made a cosy bed for itself in his bosom.Being disturbed now, it scampered away.The boy smiled, and said, “Poor fool, why so fearful?I am as forlorn as thou.’Twould be a sham in me to hurt the helpless, who am myself so helpless.Moreover, I owe you thanks for a good omen; for when a king has fallen so low that the very rats do make a bed of him, it surely meaneth that his fortunes be upon the turn, since it is plain he can no lower go.”"
"他起身，走出畜棚来。正在这时，他听到孩子们说话的声音。仓房门开了，两个小女孩走了进来。她们一看到他，就不说话，也不笑了。她们停住脚步，静静地站着，十分好奇地盯着他看。不一会儿，她们开始窃窃私语，然后再走近些，又停了脚步，盯着他低声地说着。等了会儿，她们鼓起勇气，开始大声谈论他。一个人说：","He got up and stepped out of the stall, and just then he heard the sound of children’s voices.The barn door opened and a couple of little girls came in.As soon as they saw him their talking and laughing ceased, and they stopped and stood still, gazing at him with strong curiosity; they presently began to whisper together, then they approached nearer, and stopped again to gaze and whisper.By-and-by they gathered courage and began to discuss him aloud.One said—"
"“他长着英俊的脸蛋。”","“He hath a comely face.”"
"另一个人接口说：","The other added—"
"“还有漂亮的头发。”","“And pretty hair.”"
"“可是，穿得够破烂的。”","“But is ill clothed enow.”"
"“他现在看起来饿坏了。”","“And how starved he looketh.”"
"她们走得更近了，胆怯地悄悄在他旁边围着他转，将他从上到下仔细打量了一番，好像他是什么新奇的动物。不过，她们同时又小心又警惕，好像有些害怕他可能是一种偶尔会咬你一口的动物。终于，她们在他跟前停下了，两人拉着手互相寻求保护，拿天真无邪的眼睛好好看了他一番。然后，其中一个小女孩鼓足所有的勇气，真诚而直接地问：","They came still nearer, sidling shyly around and about him, examining him minutely from all points, as if he were some strange new kind of animal, but warily and watchfully the while, as if they half feared he might be a sort of animal that would bite, upon occasion.Finally they halted before him, holding each other’s hands for protection, and took a good satisfying stare with their innocent eyes; then one of them plucked up all her courage and inquired with honest directness—"
"“你是谁，男孩儿？”","“Who art thou, boy?”"
"“我是国王。”他庄重地回答。","“I am the King,” was the grave answer."
"她们有点吃惊，哑口无言，眼睛睁得大大的，足有半分钟。然后，好奇心打破了沉默：","The children gave a little start, and their eyes spread themselves wide open and remained so during a speechless half minute.Then curiosity broke the silence—"
"“国王？什么国王？”","“The King?What King?”"
"“英国国王。”","“The King of England.”"
"两个孩子看看彼此，又看看他，接着，又看看彼此，又惊奇又困惑。然后，其中一个说：","The children looked at each other—then at him—then at each other again—wonderingly, perplexedly; then one said—"
"“你听到他说了吗，玛格丽？——他说他是国王。会是真的吗？”","“Didst hear him, Margery?—he said he is the King.Can that be true?”"
"“不是真的是什么呢，普里西？他会说谎吗？你看看，普里西，如果不是真的，它就是谎言。当然是真的。现在，想想吧。因为所有不真实的都是谎言，你得不出别的结果来。”","“How can it be else but true, Prissy?Would he say a lie?For look you, Prissy, an’ it were not true, it would be a lie.It surely would be.Now think on’t.For all things that be not true, be lies—thou canst make nought else out of it.”"
"这是一个严谨的论证，没有任何漏洞，完全击败了普里西的半信半疑。她想了一下，然后说了句很简单的话，让国王有了尊严：","It was a good tight argument, without a leak in it anywhere; and it left Prissy’s half-doubts not a leg to stand on.She considered a moment, then put the King upon his honour with the simple remark—"
"“如果你真的是国王，那我相信你。”","“If thou art truly the King, then I believe thee.”"
"“我真的是国王。”","“I am truly the King.”"
"这件事就这么定了。没有更多的问题或讨论，陛下的王族身份被接受了。两个小女孩马上开始问他怎么到这里的，他怎么会穿得这么不像国王，他要去哪里，还有所有关于他的事情。他能将他的麻烦倾诉出来，而不被嘲笑或怀疑，这让他感到非常宽慰。所以，他动情地将故事娓娓道来，甚至暂时忘了饥饿。温柔的小女孩们听着，表示出最深切、最温柔的同情。可是，当他说到他最近的经历时，她们才知道他多长时间没吃东西了。她们打断他，急忙带他到农舍，让他吃早餐。","This settled the matter.His Majesty’s royalty was accepted without further question or discussion, and the two little girls began at once to inquire into how he came to be where he was, and how he came to be so unroyally clad, and whither he was bound, and all about his affairs.It was a mighty relief to him to pour out his troubles where they would not be scoffed at or doubted; so he told his tale with feeling, forgetting even his hunger for the time; and it was received with the deepest and tenderest sympathy by the gentle little maids.But when he got down to his latest experiences and they learned how long he had been without food, they cut him short and hurried him away to the farmhouse to find a breakfast for him."
"国王现在很愉快，很高兴，心想：“等我再做回我自己时，我将永远尊敬小孩子，记住在我身处困境时他们是怎样信任我，相信我。而那些大人，自以为更聪明，却嘲笑我，认为我在说谎。”","The King was cheerful and happy now, and said to himself, “When I am come to mine own again, I will always honour little children, remembering how that these trusted me and believed in me in my time of trouble; whilst they that were older, and thought themselves wiser, mocked at me and held me for a liar.”"
"孩子们的母亲亲切地招待了国王，对他充满了同情。他无助的境况和他那显然已经错乱的心智打动了女人的心。她是个寡妇，相当贫穷，因此见过足够多的麻烦，能够去同情不幸之人。她料想，这个精神错乱的男孩跟朋友或者监护人走散了。所以，她想找出他来自哪里，好想办法将他送回去。可是，她提到了周围所有的城镇和村庄，她问了所有这方面的问题，都一无所获。男孩的脸，还有他的回答表明，他对她提到的地方都不熟悉。他只是真切地说宫廷的事，提到刚去世的国王“他的父亲”时，他多次崩溃。但是，每当谈话转到底层的话题上时，他就失去了兴趣，沉默不语。","The children’s mother received the King kindly, and was full of pity; for his forlorn condition and apparently crazed intellect touched her womanly heart.She was a widow, and rather poor; consequently she had seen trouble enough to enable her to feel for the unfortunate.She imagined that the demented boy had wandered away from his friends or keepers; so she tried to find out whence he had come, in order that she might take measures to return him; but all her references to neighbouring towns and villages, and all her inquiries in the same line went for nothing—the boy’s face, and his answers, too, showed that the things she was talking of were not familiar to him.He spoke earnestly and simply about court matters, and broke down, more than once, when speaking of the late King ‘his father’; but whenever the conversation changed to baser topics, he lost interest and became silent."
"女人困惑不已，可是她没有放弃。她一边做饭，一边开始想办法，好让男孩子出其不意地说出真正的秘密。她谈到了牛群，但他没有表现出兴趣；谈到了羊群，结果一样。这说明认为他是个牧童的猜测错了。她谈到了磨坊，谈到了织工、补锅匠、铁匠等各种行当的人。她还谈到了疯人院、监狱、收容所，但无论说到什么，她都受到了挫败。但也不是完全如此，因为她觉得自己把事情限制在家务上。是的，她确信现在她的思路是正确的，他以前一定是个家仆。所以，她就谈起了这方面。可是，结果令人失望。清扫的话题似乎令他困乏，生火没有引起他的兴趣，清洗和洗涤也没有激起他的热情。女主人心灰意冷，随口提起了烧饭的话题。让她吃惊也大为高兴的是，国王的脸立刻发亮了！啊，她想，她终于套出真相来了。她使用拐弯抹角的机灵和计谋达到目的，她为此非常骄傲。","The woman was mightily puzzled; but she did not give up.As she proceeded with her cooking, she set herself to contriving devices to surprise the boy into betraying his real secret.She talked about cattle—he showed no concern; then about sheep—the same result: so her guess that he had been a shepherd boy was an error; she talked about mills; and about weavers, tinkers, smiths, trades and tradesmen of all sorts; and about Bedlam, and jails, and charitable retreats: but no matter, she was baffled at all points.Not altogether, either; for she argued that she had narrowed the thing down to domestic service.Yes, she was sure she was on the right track, now; he must have been a house servant.So she led up to that.But the result was discouraging.The subject of sweeping appeared to weary him; fire-building failed to stir him; scrubbing and scouring awoke no enthusiasm.The goodwife touched, with a perishing hope, and rather as a matter of form, upon the subject of cooking.To her surprise, and her vast delight, the King’s face lighted at once!Ah, she had hunted him down at last, she thought; and she was right proud, too, of the devious shrewdness and tact which had accomplished it."
"现在，她疲惫的舌头有了休息的机会，因为国王受到饥饿的折磨和噼啪喷溅的锅壶所溢出来的香味的诱惑，开口说话了。他谈起美味佳肴时口若悬河，不到三分钟，女主人就心想：“我真的猜对了，他是在厨房帮厨的。”接着，他提到了很多菜的名字，很有鉴别力地、有声有色地说着这些菜，女主人心想：“天啊！他怎么会知道这么多菜的名字，而且都是如此讲究的菜？因为只有富贵人家的桌子上才会有这些菜。啊，我现在明白了！尽管他现在衣衫褴褛地被人遗弃，但他精神失常之前一定在宫廷里做事。是的，他肯定是在国王的厨房里做事！我要试试他。”","Her tired tongue got a chance to rest, now; for the King’s, inspired by gnawing hunger and the fragrant smells that came from the sputtering pots and pans, turned itself loose and delivered itself up to such an eloquent dissertation upon certain toothsome dishes, that within three minutes the woman said to herself, “Of a truth I was right—he hath holpen in a kitchen!”Then he broadened his bill of fare, and discussed it with such appreciation and animation, that the goodwife said to herself, “Good lack! how can he know so many dishes, and so fine ones withal?For these belong only upon the tables of the rich and great.Ah, now I see! ragged outcast as he is, he must have served in the palace before his reason went astray; yes, he must have helped in the very kitchen of the King himself!I will test him.”"
"她急切地想证明自己睿智的判断，便让国王来烧会儿饭，还暗示说，如果他愿意的话，还可以创意地加一两道菜。然后，她离开了房间，并打手势示意她的孩子们跟着她。国王小声抱怨道：","Full of eagerness to prove her sagacity, she told the King to mind the cooking a moment—hinting that he might manufacture and add a dish or two, if he chose; then she went out of the room and gave her children a sign to follow after.The King muttered—"
"“过去，还有一位英国国王做过类似的事情。要我去做伟大的艾尔弗雷德能屈尊做的事情，也不算损害我的尊严。不过，我要努力把委托给我的事情做得比他还好，因为他把蛋糕烤糊了。”","“Another English king had a commission like to this, in a bygone time—it is nothing against my dignity to undertake an office which the great Alfred stooped to assume.But I will try to better serve my trust than he; for he let the cakes burn.”"
"愿望是好的，可是表现并不如意，因为这位国王和另外一位一样，很快就开始沉思自己那些大事了，导致了同样糟糕的结果——饭菜给烧糊了。女主人及时回来挽救，才让早餐没有给完全毁掉。她一声爽利而热忱的责备将国王从他的梦里拉了回来。然后，看到他为没尽好责任而烦恼，她立刻软了下来，对他又仁慈又温柔。","The intent was good, but the performance was not answerable to it, for this King, like the other one, soon fell into deep thinkings concerning his vast affairs, and the same calamity resulted—the cookery got burned.The woman returned in time to save the breakfast from entire destruction; and she promptly brought the King out of his dreams with a brisk and cordial tongue-lashing.Then, seeing how troubled he was over his violated trust, she softened at once, and was all goodness and gentleness toward him."
"男孩吃了一顿丰盛、美味的饭菜，精神恢复了好多，很是高兴。这顿饭与众不同，它有这个奇妙的特点，那就是双方都取消了等级，而接受恩惠的双方对此都毫不知晓。女主人本来想让年轻的流浪者像其他流浪汉一样，或者像狗一样在角落里吃剩饭，但她十分懊悔对他的斥责，于是竭尽所能来补偿，允许他与家人围坐在一张桌子上，与她们一起吃饭，就当他与她们平等。而在国王这边，他十分懊悔没有做好委托给自己的事情，而这家人又对他那么好。于是，他强迫自己来补偿他们，便降低身份与这家人地位平等，并没有由于出身和尊严而独自享用她们的饭桌，并要求女主人和她的孩子们站着伺候他。有时，随便些对大家都好。善良的女主人对一个流浪者雅量屈尊，都为自己感到骄傲，一整天心情愉快。国王对一个卑微的农妇仁慈俯就，一样洋洋自得。","The boy made a hearty and satisfying meal, and was greatly refreshed and gladdened by it.It was a meal which was distinguished by this curious feature, that rank was waived on both sides; yet neither recipient of the favour was aware that it had been extended.The goodwife had intended to feed this young tramp with broken victuals in a corner, like any other tramp or like a dog; but she was so remorseful for the scolding she had given him, that she did what she could to atone for it by allowing him to sit at the family table and eat with his betters, on ostensible terms of equality with them; and the King, on his side, was so remorseful for having broken his trust, after the family had been so kind to him, that he forced himself to atone for it by humbling himself to the family level, instead of requiring the woman and her children to stand and wait upon him, while he occupied their table in the solitary state due to his birth and dignity.It does us all good to unbend sometimes.This good woman was made happy all the day long by the applauses which she got out of herself for her magnanimous condescension to a tramp; and the King was just as self-complacent over his gracious humility toward a humble peasant woman."
"早餐吃完了，女主人让国王洗碗。这个命令一时间让国王吃了一惊，他差点回绝。但随后，他心想：“艾尔弗雷德大帝照看蛋糕，他肯定也会洗碗的，那我就试试。”","When breakfast was over, the housewife told the King to wash up the dishes.This command was a staggerer, for a moment, and the King came near rebelling; but then he said to himself, “Alfred the Great watched the cakes; doubtless he would have washed the dishes too—therefore will I essay it.”"
"他洗得实在够糟的，连他自己都很惊讶，因为洗木勺和木盘看起来很简单。这是个枯燥、烦人的活计，但他终于完成了。现在，他迫不及待地想离开上路，但是，他不会轻易离开这个节俭的夫人的家。她把干活儿的工具交给他。他马马虎虎会用了，并得到了赞扬。然后，她让他和小女孩们给冬天的苹果削皮。可是，他削得很别扭，她于是不让他削皮了，而是给了他一把切肉刀，让他将苹果碾碎。","He made a sufficiently poor job of it; and to his surprise too, for the cleaning of wooden spoons and trenchers had seemed an easy thing to do.It was a tedious and troublesome piece of work, but he finished it at last.He was becoming impatient to get away on his journey now; however, he was not to lose this thrifty dame’s society so easily.She furnished him some little odds and ends of employment, which he got through with after a fair fashion and with some credit.Then she set him and the little girls to paring some winter apples; but he was so awkward at this service that she retired him from it and gave him a butcher knife to grind."
"后来，她让他梳理羊毛，直到他开始想，带插图的故事书和历史书上讲的值得炫耀的做粗活的英雄主义，现在自己在这一点上超过了仁慈的艾尔弗雷德国王，于是，他三心二意，不想干活了。刚刚吃过午饭时，女主人给了他一篮子小猫让他洗，他真的要推掉。至少他正要推掉——因为他觉得他必须在某个地方划清界限，而在他看来，洗小猫是个好时机——而就在这时，他忽然被打断了。打断他的是背着小贩的包裹的约翰·坎蒂和雨果。","Afterwards she kept him carding wool until he began to think he had laid the good King Alfred about far enough in the shade for the present in the matter of showy menial heroisms that would read picturesquely in story-books and histories, and so he was half-minded to resign.And when, just after the noonday dinner, the goodwife gave him a basket of kittens to drown, he did resign.At least he was just going to resign—for he felt that he must draw the line somewhere, and it seemed to him that to draw it at kitten-drowning was about the right thing—when there was an interruption.The interruption was John Canty—with a peddler’s pack on his back—and Hugo."
"国王先看到这些流氓从前门走过来，而他们还没看到他。所以，他没说划界限的事，而是拿起那篮子小猫，悄悄从后路走了，没说一句话。他从一间外室离开这帮人，急匆匆地继续走，来到后面一条窄窄的巷子里。","The King discovered these rascals approaching the front gate before they had had a chance to see him; so he said nothing about drawing the line, but took up his basket of kittens and stepped quietly out the back way, without a word.He left the creatures in an out-house, and hurried on, into a narrow lane at the rear."
"第二十章 国君和隐士","Chapter XX  The Prince and the Hermit"
"现在，高高的篱笆挡在他和房子之间。因为害怕得要死，他使出全身的气力，撒腿朝远处的森林跑去。差不多跑到了森林里，有了遮蔽处，他才敢回头看了看。他转身，看见远处有两个人影。这一眼就够了。他没等看清楚他们就急忙赶路，一直走到半明半暗的森林深处才敢放慢脚步。确定现在足够安全之后，他便停下了脚步。他仔细倾听，但只有无尽的、肃穆的沉静——吓人、平静，而又让人精神压抑。很偶尔地，他那紧张的耳朵确实捕捉到了声音，可是声音很远，很空灵，很神秘，似乎不是真的声音，而只是逝者呻吟着、抱怨着的鬼魂。所以，虽然声音打破了寂静，可是比寂静更令人害怕。","The high hedge hid him from the house, now; and so, under the impulse of a deadly fright, he let out all his forces and sped toward a wood in the distance.He never looked back until he had almost gained the shelter of the forest; then he turned and descried two figures in the distance.That was sufficient; he did not wait to scan them critically, but hurried on, and never abated his pace till he was far within the twilight depths of the wood.Then he stopped; being persuaded that he was now tolerably safe.He listened intently, but the stillness was profound and solemn—awful, even, and depressing to the spirits.At wide intervals his straining ear did detect sounds, but they were so remote, and hollow, and mysterious, that they seemed not to be real sounds, but only the moaning and complaining ghosts of departed ones.So the sounds were yet more dreary than the silence which they interrupted."
"刚开始时，他打算今天就呆在此处，可过不了多久，一阵寒意侵入他出了汗的身体。最后，他为了保暖，不得不继续走动。他在森林里径直朝前走，希望能尽快穿过森林，走到路上。可是，他失望了。他接着走啊，走啊，可他走得越远，森林明显变得越密。渐渐地，昏暗变得越来越浓重，国王意识到夜晚来临了。一想到要在这个可怕的地方过夜，他就不寒而栗，于是他想加快步伐，却走得更慢了，因为他现在看不清路，无法找准方向。结果，他不是被树根绊脚，就是被树藤和荆棘缠住。","It was his purpose, in the beginning, to stay where he was the rest of the day; but a chill soon invaded his perspiring body, and he was at last obliged to resume movement in order to get warm.He struck straight through the forest, hoping to pierce to a road presently, but he was disappointed in this.He travelled on and on; but the farther he went, the denser the wood became, apparently.The gloom began to thicken, by-and-by, and the King realised that the night was coming on.It made him shudder to think of spending it in such an uncanny place; so he tried to hurry faster, but he only made the less speed, for he could not now see well enough to choose his steps judiciously; consequently he kept tripping over roots and tangling himself in vines and briers."
"终于，他看见一线灯光，他是多么地高兴啊！他小心翼翼地朝灯光走去，时不时停下来看一看周围，侧耳倾听。灯光从一间破旧小屋的一扇没镶玻璃的窗口照射出来。这会儿，他听到了一个声音。他下意识地想跑开躲起来，但他马上改变了想法，因为这个声音显然是在祈祷。他溜到小屋的窗边，踮起脚尖，往里面偷看了一眼。房间很小，地面是天然的泥土地，被踩得很硬；墙角处有一张灯心草铺的床和一两条破毛毯；旁边放着一只桶、一个杯子、一个盆、两三个坛坛罐罐；还有一只小板凳和一张三条腿的凳子；壁炉上，没烧完的柴火冒着烟；一根蜡烛照亮了圣坛，圣坛前跪着一位老人，他身旁的旧木匣子上放着一本打开的书和一个骷髅头。这个人身材高大，瘦得皮包骨头，头发和胡须很长，颜色雪白。他穿着一件羊皮袍子，从脖子拖到了脚跟。","And how glad he was when at last he caught the glimmer of a light!He approached it warily, stopping often to look about him and listen.It came from an unglazed window-opening in a shabby little hut.He heard a voice, now, and felt a disposition to run and hide; but he changed his mind at once, for this voice was praying, evidently.He glided to the one window of the hut, raised himself on tiptoe, and stole a glance within.The room was small; its floor was the natural earth, beaten hard by use; in a corner was a bed of rushes and a ragged blanket or two; near it was a pail, a cup, a basin, and two or three pots and pans; there was a short bench and a three-legged stool; on the hearth the remains of a faggot fire were smouldering; before a shrine, which was lighted by a single candle, knelt an aged man, and on an old wooden box at his side lay an open book and a human skull.The man was of large, bony frame; his hair and whiskers were very long and snowy white; he was clothed in a robe of sheepskins which reached from his neck to his heels."
"“一位高洁的隐士！”国王自语道，“这下我真的有救了。”","“A holy hermit!” said the King to himself; “now am I indeed fortunate.”"
"隐士站了起来，国王敲了敲门。回答的是一个深沉的声音：","The hermit rose from his knees; the King knocked.A deep voice responded—"
"“进来！但不要把罪恶带进来，因为你要踏上的土地是神圣的！”","“Enter!—but leave sin behind, for the ground whereon thou shalt stand is holy!”"
"国王走进来，停在那儿。隐士一双发亮、不安的眼睛朝他看过去，说道：","The King entered, and paused.The hermit turned a pair of gleaming, unrestful eyes upon him, and said—"
"“你是谁？”","“Who art thou?”"
"“我是国王。”回答温和而率直。","“I am the King,” came the answer, with placid simplicity."
"“欢迎，国王！”隐士热情地大声说。于是，老人开始手忙脚乱起来，还不停地说着“欢迎，欢迎”。他在壁炉边摆了板凳，让国王坐在上面，往炉火里添了些柴。最后，他开始在屋里紧张地踱来踱去。","“Welcome, King!” cried the hermit, with enthusiasm.Then, bustling about with feverish activity, and constantly saying, “Welcome, welcome,” he arranged his bench, seated the King on it, by the hearth, threw some faggots on the fire, and finally fell to pacing the floor with a nervous stride."
"“欢迎！很多人都来过这儿寻求至圣所，但他们都微不足道，都被赶出去了。但是，一个国王能扔掉他的皇冠，抛弃宫殿里的虚荣浮华，穿上褴褛的衣衫，潜心向圣，亲身修行，真是了不起，我很欢迎他！他可以在这里终老一生。”国王急着想打断他，跟他解释，可隐士没注意到。显然，他甚至都没听见他说话，只顾继续说自己的，声调越来越高，说得越来越起劲。“在这里，没人会打扰您。没人会找到您的藏身处来打扰您，来恳求您回到那种上帝让您抛弃的空虚、愚蠢的生活。您将在这里祈祷，您将研读圣经，您将沉思世界上的荒唐事和种种迷惑，沉思即将到来的世界的崇高。您还将以面包皮和药草为食，每天用鞭子鞭打您的身体，来净化您的灵魂。您将穿着毛衣服，让它直接贴着您的皮肤，您将只能喝水，您将永远安宁——是的，绝对的安宁，因为不管谁来找您，都将无功而返。他不会找到您，他不会骚扰您。”","“Welcome!Many have sought sanctuary here, but they were not worthy, and were turned away.But a King who casts his crown away, and despises the vain splendours of his office, and clothes his body in rags, to devote his life to holiness and the mortification of the flesh—he is worthy, he is welcome!—here shall he abide all his days till death come.”The King hastened to interrupt and explain, but the hermit paid no attention to him—did not even hear him, apparently, but went right on with his talk, with a raised voice and a growing energy.“And thou shalt be at peace here.None shall find out thy refuge to disquiet thee with supplications to return to that empty and foolish life which God hath moved thee to abandon.Thou shalt pray here; thou shalt study the Book; thou shalt meditate upon the follies and delusions of this world, and upon the sublimities of the world to come; thou shalt feed upon crusts and herbs, and scourge thy body with whips, daily, to the purifying of thy soul.Thou shalt wear a hair shirt next thy skin; thou shalt drink water only; and thou shalt be at peace; yes, wholly at peace; for whoso comes to seek thee shall go his way again, baffled; he shall not find thee, he shall not molest thee.”"
"老人仍然在踱来踱去。他不再大声说话，而是开始轻声低语。国王抓住这个机会，陈述自己的情况。由于不安和担心，他滔滔不绝地讲着。但是，隐士继续轻声低语，没有理会他。他一边继续轻声低语着，一边走近国王，动情地说：","The old man, still pacing back and forth, ceased to speak aloud, and began to mutter.The King seized this opportunity to state his case; and he did it with an eloquence inspired by uneasiness and apprehension.But the hermit went on muttering, and gave no heed.And still muttering, he approached the King and said impressively—"
"“安静！我告诉您一个秘密！”他弯腰正要开口，却欲言又止，摆出了一幅倾听的样子。过了片刻，他踮起脚尖走到窗口，把头伸出去，朝薄暮中四处望了望，然后又踮着脚尖走回来，将他的脸朝下挨着国王的脸，耳语道：","“’Sh!I will tell you a secret!”He bent down to impart it, but checked himself, and assumed a listening attitude.After a moment or two he went on tiptoe to the window-opening, put his head out, and peered around in the gloaming, then came tiptoeing back again, put his face close down to the King’s, and whispered—"
"“我是大天使！”","“I am an archangel!”"
"国王大吃一惊，心想：“愿上帝让我再回到亡命之徒那里，因为——看，我现在成了一个疯子的囚徒！”他更加担心了，从脸上完全能看出来。隐士低声而兴奋地接着说：","The King started violently, and said to himself, “Would God I were with the outlaws again; for lo, now am I the prisoner of a madman!”His apprehensions were heightened, and they showed plainly in his face.In a low excited voice the hermit continued—"
"“我知道你感觉到了我的气氛！你面有惧色！没有谁可以在这个气氛中不受影响，因为这正是天堂的气氛。我到了天堂又回来了，就在一眨眼的瞬间。那是五年前，我就在这个地方被任命为大天使，是天堂派来的天使授予我这个极大的荣耀的。天使的到来将这个地方照得十分明亮，亮得让人无法忍受。他们向我下跪，国王！是的，他们向我下跪！因为我比他们地位更高。我在天庭里走过，与主教们说过话。摸一下我的手——别害怕，摸一下。好了，现在，你摸过了一只曾经被亚伯拉罕、艾萨克和雅各布紧握过的手！因为，我在金色的天庭里走过，我面对面见过上帝！”为了强调说话的效果，他顿了顿，然后,他的脸色突然变了，他又站了起来，生气而又激动地说：“是的，我是大天使，只是一个大天使！我本来可能是主教！","“I see you feel my atmosphere!There’s awe in your face!None may be in this atmosphere and not be thus affected; for it is the very atmosphere of heaven.I go thither and return, in the twinkling of an eye.I was made an archangel on this very spot, it is five years ago, by angels sent from heaven to confer that awful dignity.Their presence filled this place with an intolerable brightness.And they knelt to me, King!Yes, they knelt to me!For I was greater than they.I have walked in the courts of heaven, and held speech with the patriarchs.Touch my hand—be not afraid—touch it.There—now thou hast touched a hand which has been clasped by Abraham and Isaac and Jacob!For I have walked in the golden courts; I have seen the Deity face to face!”He paused, to give this speech effect; then his face suddenly changed, and he started to his feet again saying, with angry energy, “Yes, I am an archangel; A MERE ARCHANGEL!—I that might have been pope!"
"这是事实。二十年前，上帝在睡梦中告诉我的。啊，是的，我本应该是主教！我本应该做主教的，因为上帝说过。可是，国王把我的教堂毁了，而我，一个可怜、渺小、没有朋友的修道士，便在这个世界上无家可归了，我那无量的前途就这样给毁了！”此时，他又开始咕哝，盛怒之下，还徒劳地用拳头连续击打自己的额头。他时不时恶毒地诅咒一句，时不时又可怜巴巴地说：“为什么我只是一个大天使——我啊，本应该做主教的！”他就这么说了一个小时，而可怜的小国王坐着，忍受着。接着，老人突然停止了癫狂，变得非常温柔。他的嗓音变得柔软，他也不那么阴郁了，而是开始率真地、有人情味地东拉西扯，很快就完全赢得了国王的心。这位老信徒把男孩挪到靠近炉火的地方，让他舒舒服服的，还用灵巧、温柔的手给他的小块的瘀伤和擦伤做护理，接着又开始准备烧晚饭。他愉快地说个不停，偶尔还温柔地摸一下小家伙的脸颊，或者拍一下他的头。在这种温柔的爱抚下，不一会儿，国王对大天使的所有害怕和厌恶都变成了尊敬和喜爱。","It is verily true.I was told it from heaven in a dream, twenty years ago; ah, yes, I was to be pope!—and I should have been pope, for Heaven had said it—but the King dissolved my religious house, and I, poor obscure unfriended monk, was cast homeless upon the world, robbed of my mighty destiny!”Here he began to mumble again, and beat his forehead in futile rage, with his fist; now and then articulating a venomous curse, and now and then a pathetic “Wherefore I am nought but an archangel—I that should have been pope!”So he went on, for an hour, whilst the poor little King sat and suffered.Then all at once the old man’s frenzy departed, and he became all gentleness.His voice softened, he came down out of his clouds, and fell to prattling along so simply and so humanly, that he soon won the King’s heart completely.The old devotee moved the boy nearer to the fire and made him comfortable; doctored his small bruises and abrasions with a deft and tender hand; and then set about preparing and cooking a supper—chatting pleasantly all the time, and occasionally stroking the lad’s cheek or patting his head, in such a gently caressing way that in a little while all the fear and repulsion inspired by the archangel were changed to reverence and affection for the man."
"他们吃晚饭时，气氛仍然很融洽。接着，在圣坛前祈祷之后，隐士让男孩到隔壁一间小屋去睡觉，并像一个母亲那样，亲切地为他将被子盖得暖暖和和的。然后，隐士抚摸了他一下才离开，在炉火旁坐下，心不在焉地胡乱拨弄着烙铁。过了一会儿，他停下了，然后用手指拍了几下自己的额头，似乎在努力去记起他忘了的什么事情。显然，他没记起来。此时，他迅速起身，走进他客人的房间里，说：","This happy state of things continued while the two ate the supper; then, after a prayer before the shrine, the hermit put the boy to bed, in a small adjoining room, tucking him in as snugly and lovingly as a mother might; and so, with a parting caress, left him and sat down by the fire, and began to poke the brands about in an absent and aimless way.Presently he paused; then tapped his forehead several times with his fingers, as if trying to recall some thought which had escaped from his mind.Apparently he was unsuccessful.Now he started quickly up, and entered his guest’s room, and said—"
"“您是国王？”","“Thou art King?”"
"“是的。”国王昏昏欲睡地回答道。","“Yes,” was the response, drowsily uttered."
"“什么国王？”","“What King?”"
"“英国国王。”","“Of England.”"
"“英国国王？那么亨利去世了！”","“Of England?Then Henry is gone!”"
"“呜呼，是这样。我是他的儿子。”","“Alack, it is so.I am his son.”"
"隐士锁紧了眉头，攥紧骨瘦如柴的手，充满了报复的力量。他站了一会儿，呼吸急促，不断吞咽，然后用沙哑的声音说：","A black frown settled down upon the hermit’s face, and he clenched his bony hands with a vindictive energy.He stood a few moments, breathing fast and swallowing repeatedly, then said in a husky voice—"
"“是他让我们在这个世界上没有住所，无家可归，你知道吗？”","“Dost know it was he that turned us out into the world houseless and homeless?”"
"没人回答。老人弯下腰，看了看男孩平静的脸，听了听他温和的呼吸。“他睡了，沉沉地睡了。”他的眉头不再紧皱，取而代之的是一副邪恶的自得的表情。微笑掠过睡梦中的男孩子的脸。隐士咕哝道：“那么，他的心是快乐的。”然后，他转身走开了。他悄悄地在四周走来走去，到处寻找着什么东西。他一会儿停下来听听，一会儿又把他的脑袋猛拉过来，朝床那边迅速地看一眼。而且，他一直在轻声低语，一直在自言自语。终于，他似乎找到了他要找的东西——一把生锈的旧屠刀和一块磨刀石。接着，他蹑手蹑脚地走到炉火旁，坐下来，开始轻轻地在石块上磨那把刀，嘴里仍旧在低语着，咕哝着，时不时蹦出几个字。风在这孤独的地方叹息，夜晚那神秘的声音从远处飘过。缝隙和隐蔽处，大胆的老鼠和耗子探出闪闪发光的眼睛盯着老人，但是，他继续全神贯注地、一心一意地磨自己的刀，没注意到周围的事情。","There was no response.The old man bent down and scanned the boy’s reposeful face and listened to his placid breathing.“He sleeps—sleeps soundly;” and the frown vanished away and gave place to an expression of evil satisfaction.A smile flitted across the dreaming boy’s features.The hermit muttered, “So—his heart is happy;” and he turned away.He went stealthily about the place, seeking here and there for something; now and then halting to listen, now and then jerking his head around and casting a quick glance toward the bed; and always muttering, always mumbling to himself.At last he found what he seemed to want—a rusty old butcher knife and a whetstone.Then he crept to his place by the fire, sat himself down, and began to whet the knife softly on the stone, still muttering, mumbling, ejaculating.The winds sighed around the lonely place, the mysterious voices of the night floated by out of the distances.The shining eyes of venturesome mice and rats peered out at the old man from cracks and coverts, but he went on with his work, rapt, absorbed, and noted none of these things."
"间或，他用大拇指试了试刀锋，满意地点点头。“刀已经磨得很锋利了，”他说，“是的，已经很锋利了。”","At long intervals he drew his thumb along the edge of his knife, and nodded his head with satisfaction.“It grows sharper,” he said; “yes, it grows sharper.”"
"他忘记了飞逝的时间，只是静静地磨着，自己想着什么高兴的事，偶尔突然叨念出几句话来：","He took no note of the flight of time, but worked tranquilly on, entertaining himself with his thoughts, which broke out occasionally in articulate speech—"
"“他父亲把我们整惨了，他毁了我们，而他已经进入地狱里永不停息的大火中！是的，进入永不停息的大火中！他逃出了我们的手心，可那是上帝的意愿，是的，那是上帝的意愿，我们不能抱怨。但是，他没有逃过大火！没有，他没有逃过大火，强烈、无情、残酷的大火，而且大火永不停息！”","“His father wrought us evil, he destroyed us—and is gone down into the eternal fires!Yes, down into the eternal fires!He escaped us—but it was God’s will, yes it was God’s will, we must not repine.But he hath not escaped the fires!No, he hath not escaped the fires, the consuming, unpitying, remorseless fires—and they are everlasting!”"
"他就这么磨啊，磨啊，有时低语，还会粗声粗气地轻笑两声，有时又突然说话：","And so he wrought, and still wrought—mumbling, chuckling a low rasping chuckle at times—and at times breaking again into words—"
"“是他父亲一手造成的。我只是一个大天使，要不是他，我应该做主教！”","“It was his father that did it all.I am but an archangel; but for him I should be pope!”"
"国王翻了翻身。老人悄悄地跑到床边，双膝跪下，举着他的刀子，朝躺着的身躯弯下腰。男孩又翻了次身，眼睛挣开了一会儿，可是，那双眼睛里没有思虑，没有看到什么。接着，他平静的呼吸表明他又睡熟了。","The King stirred.The hermit sprang noiselessly to the bedside, and went down upon his knees, bending over the prostrate form with his knife uplifted.The boy stirred again; his eyes came open for an instant, but there was no speculation in them, they saw nothing; the next moment his tranquil breathing showed that his sleep was sound once more."
"隐士保持这个姿势，几乎没有呼吸，观察和倾听了一会儿。然后，他慢慢地放下自己的胳膊，不一会儿，他爬走了，说：","The hermit watched and listened, for a time, keeping his position and scarcely breathing; then he slowly lowered his arms, and presently crept away, saying,—"
"“午夜已经过了好长时间，如果他喊出声来就不好了，怕有人碰巧经过。”","“It is long past midnight; it is not best that he should cry out, lest by accident someone be passing.”"
"他在小屋里悄悄走来走去，从这儿找一块破布，从那儿拿一条皮带，又从别处拿个什么东西。然后，他回到床边，小心、轻柔地将国王的脚踝绑在一起，没有吵醒他。他接着想绑他的手腕。他试了几次想把它们交叉起来，可是，正当要用绳子绑时，男孩不是把这只手伸开，就是把另一只手伸开。但是，终于，当大天使几乎绝望时，男孩自己双手交叉，紧接着，它们便被绑起来了。现在，一条绷带从这个熟睡的人的下巴下穿过，接着被拉到他的头上，紧紧地系住了。他那么轻柔地、一点一点地，而又如此熟练地将结打结实了，所以，男孩没有被惊动，一直安静地睡着。","He glided about his hovel, gathering a rag here, a thong there, and another one yonder; then he returned, and by careful and gentle handling he managed to tie the King’s ankles together without waking him.Next he essayed to tie the wrists; he made several attempts to cross them, but the boy always drew one hand or the other away, just as the cord was ready to be applied; but at last, when the archangel was almost ready to despair, the boy crossed his hands himself, and the next moment they were bound.Now a bandage was passed under the sleeper’s chin and brought up over his head and tied fast—and so softly, so gradually, and so deftly were the knots drawn together and compacted, that the boy slept peacefully through it all without stirring."
"第二十一章 亨登前来救驾","Chapter XXI  Hendon to the Rescue"
"老人弯着腰，偷偷地，像猫一样滑动着走开，把矮板凳拿了过来。他坐在凳子上，身体一半露在昏暗闪烁的灯光下，一半埋在阴影里。就这样，他渴望的双眼注视着沉睡的男孩，耐心地守夜，全然不顾时间的流逝，轻轻地磨着他的刀，还叨叨咕咕，轻声发笑。从样子和神态看，他不像别的，就像一只巨大的灰色蜘蛛正幸灾乐祸地看着某个倒霉的昆虫无助地黏在了它的蛛网上。","The old man glided away, stooping, stealthy, cat-like, and brought the low bench.He seated himself upon it, half his body in the dim and flickering light, and the other half in shadow; and so, with his craving eyes bent upon the slumbering boy, he kept his patient vigil there, heedless of the drift of time, and softly whetted his knife, and mumbled and chuckled; and in aspect and attitude he resembled nothing so much as a grizzly, monstrous spider, gloating over some hapless insect that lay bound and helpless in his web."
"过了好一会儿，老人还在凝视着，但什么都没看见，他的精神正处于游离状态。突然，他发现那男孩双眼睁着！他双眼圆睁，目不转睛地盯着上面的刀子，吓呆了。","After a long while, the old man, who was still gazing,—yet not seeing, his mind having settled into a dreamy abstraction,—observed, on a sudden, that the boy’s eyes were open!wide open and staring!—staring up in frozen horror at the knife."
"老人的脸上渐渐露出了魔鬼般满意的笑容，他的姿势或动作没变，说道：“亨利八世的儿子，您祈祷了吗？”","The smile of a gratified devil crept over the old man’s face, and he said, without changing his attitude or his occupation—“Son of Henry the Eighth, hast thou prayed?”"
"男孩在捆绑中无助地挣扎着，同时从闭着的口中闷闷地挤出一声，隐士就权当这是对问题的肯定回答。","The boy struggled helplessly in his bonds, and at the same time forced a smothered sound through his closed jaws, which the hermit chose to interpret as an affirmative answer to his question."
"“那么再祈祷一遍。为即将到来的死亡而祈祷！”","“Then pray again.Pray the prayer for the dying!”"
"男孩打了个哆嗦，浑身颤抖，脸色发白。然后，他又挣扎着想逃脱，朝这边又朝那边又转又扭的。他疯狂地、猛烈地、绝望地扯着想挣脱束缚，却徒劳无功。这个老魔鬼始终朝下冲着他微笑，点着头，平静地磨着他的刀，还时不时喃喃自语：“时间是宝贵的，少而宝贵——为死亡祈祷吧！”","A shudder shook the boy’s frame, and his face blenched.Then he struggled again to free himself—turning and twisting himself this way and that; tugging frantically, fiercely, desperately—but uselessly—to burst his fetters; and all the while the old ogre smiled down upon him, and nodded his head, and placidly whetted his knife; mumbling, from time to time, “The moments are precious, they are few and precious—pray the prayer for the dying!”"
"男孩绝望地呻吟了一声，停止了挣扎，气喘吁吁。接着，男孩的眼泪流出来，一颗一颗地顺着脸颊淌下，但这可怜的情形并未使残忍的老人心软。","The boy uttered a despairing groan, and ceased from his struggles, panting.The tears came, then, and trickled, one after the other, down his face; but this piteous sight wrought no softening effect upon the savage old man."
"天就要亮了。隐士觉察到了，便突然大声说起话来，声音里有种神经兮兮的忧虑：","The dawn was coming now; the hermit observed it, and spoke up sharply, with a touch of nervous apprehension in his voice—"
"“我不能再沉浸在这狂喜之中了！夜晚已经过去。那似乎只是一瞬间——只是一瞬间，但愿它能持续一整年！破坏教会的人留下的种子，闭上你那该死的眼睛，你不敢看——”","“I may not indulge this ecstasy longer!The night is already gone.It seems but a moment—only a moment; would it had endured a year!Seed of the Church’s spoiler, close thy perishing eyes, an’ thou fearest to look upon—”"
"剩下的话就成了模模糊糊的咕哝，听不清楚。老人双膝跪下来，手里拿着刀子，朝呻吟的男孩弯下腰。","The rest was lost in inarticulate mutterings.The old man sank upon his knees, his knife in his hand, and bent himself over the moaning boy."
"听！小木屋旁传来说话声。刀子从隐士手中滑落，他拖过一张羊皮盖住男孩，突然站起身来，浑身颤抖。声音大了，过了一会儿，那说话声变得粗鲁而愤怒，接着是打架的声音、呼救的喊声，然后是有人急速逃离的脚步声。紧接着，小木屋外就传来了咚咚响的敲门声，接着有人说：","Hark!There was a sound of voices near the cabin—the knife dropped from the hermit’s hand; he cast a sheepskin over the boy and started up, trembling.The sounds increased, and presently the voices became rough and angry; then came blows, and cries for help; then a clatter of swift footsteps, retreating.Immediately came a succession of thundering knocks upon the cabin door, followed by—"
"“喂——喂！开门！看在所有魔鬼的份上，快点！”","“Hullo-o-o!Open!And despatch, in the name of all the devils!”"
"啊，这是国王的耳朵听到的最神圣的声音，甚至像音乐一般，因为那是迈尔斯·亨登的声音！","Oh, this was the blessedest sound that had ever made music in the King’s ears; for it was Miles Hendon’s voice!"
"隐士咬牙切齿，愤怒却无能为力。他迅速地走出卧室，走出小木屋，把身后的门关上了。国王随即听到这个“小礼拜堂”式的谈话，大意是这样的：","The hermit, grinding his teeth in impotent rage, moved swiftly out of the bedchamber, closing the door behind him; and straightway the King heard a talk, to this effect, proceeding from the ‘chapel’:—"
"“向您致敬和问候，尊敬的先生！男孩在哪儿——我的男孩？”","“Homage and greeting, reverend sir!Where is the boy—My boy?”"
"“什么男孩，朋友？”","“What boy, friend?”"
"“什么男孩！别跟我撒谎，牧师先生，别跟我耍诡计！我现在没那个心情。我在这附近抓住了那些恶棍，我断定是他们把他从我这里偷走的，而且我让他们坦白交待了。他们说他又逃跑了，便追到了你的门口。他们给我看他的脚印。别再搪塞了，你看看你，神圣的先生，你不把他交出来，这男孩子会在哪儿呢？”","“What boy!Lie me no lies, sir priest, play me no deceptions!—I am not in the humour for it.Near to this place I caught the scoundrels who I judged did steal him from me, and I made them confess; they said he was at large again, and they had tracked him to your door.They showed me his very footprints.Now palter no more; for look you, holy sir, an’ thou produce him not—Where is the boy?”"
"“噢，好心的先生，你可能是指那个穿着破旧皇室衣服的游民吧，他昨晚在这儿留宿了。如果像你这样的人会对他那样的人感兴趣，那么，好吧，我派他出去办点事了。他等一会儿就回来了。”","“O good sir, peradventure you mean the ragged regal vagrant that tarried here the night.If such as you take an interest in such as he, know, then, that I have sent him of an errand.He will be back anon.”"
"“多久？多久？快说，别浪费时间，我不能赶上他吗？他多久会回来？”","“How soon?How soon?Come, waste not the time—cannot I overtake him?How soon will he be back?”"
"“你不用着急，他很快就回来。”","“Thou need’st not stir; he will return quickly.”"
"“那么，就这样吧。我就试着等等。可是，等一下！你派他去办事？你！这一定是谎言，他不会去的。要是你真的对他那么傲慢，他会扯掉你的胡子。你撒谎，朋友，你肯定撒了谎！他不会为你去办事，不会为任何人。”","“So be it, then.I will try to wait.But stop!—You sent him of an errand?—you!Verily this is a lie—he would not go.He would pull thy old beard, an’ thou didst offer him such an insolence.Thou hast lied, friend; thou hast surely lied!He would not go for thee, nor for any man.”"
"“为任何人，不会，他或许不会。可我不是一个人。”","“For any man—no; haply not.But I am not a man.”"
"“什么！那么，看在上帝的份上，你是什么？”“这是个秘密——记着，不能说出去。我是大天使！”","“What!Now o’ God’s name what art thou, then?”“It is a secret—mark thou reveal it not.I am an archangel!”"
"迈尔斯·亨登忽然大叫一声，不太像是咒骂，然后接着说：","There was a tremendous ejaculation from Miles Hendon—not altogether unprofane—followed by—"
"“这就能真正解释了他为什么乖乖地跑腿去了！我很了解，他不会为任何凡人在这不体面的活儿上亲力亲为，可是，主啊，当一个大天使下达命令时，即使是国王也得听从！让我——嘘！那是什么声音？”","“This doth well and truly account for his complaisance!Right well I knew he would budge nor hand nor foot in the menial service of any mortal; but, lord, even a king must obey when an archangel gives the word o’ command!Let me—’sh!What noise was that?”"
"这个时候，小国王正在那边一会儿因害怕而发颤，一会因希望而发抖。同时，他也一直在使劲全身的气力发出痛苦的呻吟声，总是希望能传到亨登的耳朵里，但是又一直痛苦地明白，亨登没听到，或者至少没注意。他的仆人刚才的那句话就像从生气勃勃的田野吹来复苏的气息，吹向垂死之人，于是他又一次用尽全身的气力。这时，隐士说道：","All this while the little King had been yonder, alternately quaking with terror and trembling with hope; and all the while, too, he had thrown all the strength he could into his anguished moanings, constantly expecting them to reach Hendon’s ear, but always realising, with bitterness, that they failed, or at least made no impression.So this last remark of his servant came as comes a reviving breath from fresh fields to the dying; and he exerted himself once more, and with all his energy, just as the hermit was saying—"
"“有声音？我只听到了风声。”","“Noise?I heard only the wind.”"
"“可能是风声。是的，毫无疑问是风声。我一路都隐隐约约听到风——那声音又来了！不是风的声音！多么奇怪的声音！来，我们找找它从哪里来的！”","“Mayhap it was.Yes, doubtless that was it.I have been hearing it faintly all the—there it is again!It is not the wind!What an odd sound!Come, we will hunt it out!”"
"现在，国王几乎忍不住了。他那疲倦的肺尽了全力，也充满希望。但是，被塞住的嘴巴和盖住他的羊毛皮不幸阻碍了他的努力。于是，可怜的家伙的心沉了下来。他听到隐士说：","Now the King’s joy was nearly insupportable.His tired lungs did their utmost—and hopefully, too—but the sealed jaws and the muffling sheepskin sadly crippled the effort.Then the poor fellow’s heart sank, to hear the hermit say—"
"“啊，声音是从外面传来的，我想是从远处的小树林里。来，我来领路。”","“Ah, it came from without—I think from the copse yonder.Come, I will lead the way.”"
"国王听到这俩人说着话，走出去；听到他们的脚步声很快地消失——接着就剩下了他自己陷入不祥的、压抑并可怕的寂静中。","The King heard the two pass out, talking; heard their footsteps die quickly away—then he was alone with a boding, brooding, awful silence."
"等他再听到脚步声和说话声渐近的时候，这段时间漫长得像是过了一辈子。这时，他听到了其他声音，明显是马蹄声。接着他听到亨登说：","It seemed an age till he heard the steps and voices approaching again—and this time he heard an added sound,—the trampling of hoofs, apparently.Then he heard Hendon say—"
"“我不会再等了。我不能再等了。他一定在这茂密的森林里迷了路。他朝哪个方向走了？快点，指给我看。”","“I will not wait longer.I cannot wait longer.He has lost his way in this thick wood.Which direction took he?Quick—point it out to me.”"
"“他——不过等一下，我跟你去。”","“He—but wait; I will go with thee.”"
"“好，好！啊，你的心眼比你的长相好多了。天啊，我想没有第二个大天使有你这么好的心眼了。你骑马吗？你是骑这头为我的男孩子准备的小驴呢，还是跨开你神圣的双腿，骑我的这头坏脾气的骡子呢？这也是骗来的，我借给一个补锅匠一个法寻，放了一个月的高利贷买来的，不值什么钱。”","“Good—good!Why, truly thou art better than thy looks.Marry I do not think there’s not another archangel with so right a heart as thine.Wilt ride?Wilt take the wee donkey that’s for my boy, or wilt thou fork thy holy legs over this ill-conditioned slave of a mule that I have provided for myself?—and had been cheated in too, had he cost but the indifferent sum of a month’s usury on a brass farthing let to a tinker out of work.”"
"“不，骑着你的骡子，牵着你的驴，我更相信自己的双脚，我走路。”","“No—ride thy mule, and lead thine ass; I am surer on mine own feet, and will walk.”"
"“那么，请在我冒着生命危险骑上这头大骡子时，帮我照看一下这头小驴。骑上它可算是一件成功的事。”","“Then prithee mind the little beast for me while I take my life in my hands and make what success I may toward mounting the big one.”"
"接着，外面传来了一阵踢、打、踩踏和跳跃的混乱声，伴随着一连串雷鸣般的大声诅咒。最后，那骡子挨了一声狠狠的吆喝，准是吓掉了魂，因为之后它似乎就停止了敌意的行为。","Then followed a confusion of kicks, cuffs, tramplings and plungings, accompanied by a thunderous intermingling of volleyed curses, and finally a bitter apostrophe to the mule, which must have broken its spirit, for hostilities seemed to cease from that moment."
"被绑住的小国王听着说话声和脚步声渐渐远去，然后消失，痛苦得难以形容。所有希望都离他而去，此时此刻，他的心里是阴晦的绝望。“我唯一的朋友上了当，被引开了，”他说，“隐士会回来，而且——”他倒吸了一口气，没再说下去，而是立即又开始疯狂地挣扎着，想挣脱束缚，终于把令人窒息的羊皮甩掉了。","With unutterable misery the fettered little King heard the voices and footsteps fade away and die out.All hope forsook him, now, for the moment, and a dull despair settled down upon his heart.“My only friend is deceived and got rid of,” he said; “the hermit will return and—”  He finished with a gasp; and at once fell to struggling so frantically with his bonds again, that he shook off the smothering sheepskin."
"这时，他听到门开了！这声音让他毛骨悚然，他似乎已经感觉到了喉咙上的刀子。恐惧使他闭上了双眼，恐惧又使他睁开了双眼——他面前站着约翰·坎蒂和雨果！","And now he heard the door open!The sound chilled him to the marrow—already he seemed to feel the knife at his throat.Horror made him close his eyes; horror made him open them again—and before him stood John Canty and Hugo!"
"如果嘴巴里没有塞东西，他一定会说“谢天谢地”！","He would have said “Thank God!” if his jaws had been free."
"才一会儿的工夫，他的四肢得到了自由，逮住他的两个人一边一个抓着他的胳膊，急忙全速跑进森林。","A moment or two later his limbs were at liberty, and his captors, each gripping him by an arm, were hurrying him with all speed through the forest."
"第二十二章 背叛的受害者","Chapter XXII  A Victim of Treachery"
"“国王佛佛一世”又跟这些流浪者和亡命之徒们漂泊了，做他们粗野笑话和愚蠢逗趣的笑柄。首领不注意的时候，他就落在了坎蒂和雨果手里，成了他们小恶意的受害者。只有坎蒂和雨果真的不喜欢他。其他一些人喜欢他，并且都佩服他的勇气和精神。这两三天，雨果监视掌控着国王，并用尽一切偷偷摸摸的办法使这个男孩子不舒服。在晚上惯常的狂欢宴会上，他轻微地羞辱汤姆来逗大伙，而且总是假装是出于无意似的。他两次“无意地”踩到国王的脚趾，而国王为了与皇帝相称的身份，只是轻蔑地表示对此无毫不在意且漠不关心。但是，当雨果为了取乐第三次这样做时，国王用棍子将他打倒在地，众人异常地高兴。雨果恼怒成羞，跳起来，抓了条棍子，狂怒地奔向他的小敌人。紧接着，人们在格斗士的身边围成了一个圈，开始打赌和欢呼起来。","Once more ‘King Foo-foo the First’ was roving with the tramps and outlaws, a butt for their coarse jests and dull-witted railleries, and sometimes the victim of small spitefulness at the hands of Canty and Hugo when the Ruffler’s back was turned.None but Canty and Hugo really disliked him.Some of the others liked him, and all admired his pluck and spirit.During two or three days, Hugo, in whose ward and charge the King was, did what he covertly could to make the boy uncomfortable; and at night, during the customary orgies, he amused the company by putting small indignities upon him—always as if by accident.Twice he stepped upon the King’s toes—accidentally—and the King, as became his royalty, was contemptuously unconscious of it and indifferent to it; but the third time Hugo entertained himself in that way, the King felled him to the ground with a cudgel, to the prodigious delight of the tribe.Hugo, consumed with anger and shame, sprang up, seized a cudgel, and came at his small adversary in a fury.Instantly a ring was formed around the gladiators, and the betting and cheering began."
"但是，可怜的雨果是没有希望了。他那狂乱和笨拙的学徒招式根本没人买账，因为这时他遇到的是由欧洲头号大师教了单棍、铁头木棒和所有的剑术、剑法的对手。小国王警惕而优雅放松地站着，轻而易举并准确无误地接住或闪开暴雨似的乱打，混杂的旁观者对此敬佩万分，狂喜不已。时不时地，他那老练的眼睛发现了机会，于是闪电般地朝雨果的脑袋敲过去。这时，如暴风骤雨般的欢呼和笑声淹没了这个地方，听起来美妙极了。一刻钟后，雨果已经遍体鳞伤，伤痕累累。无情的嘲笑冲着他狂轰乱炸，他偷偷地从战场上溜走了。欢乐的乌合之众抓住格斗中未受伤的英雄，把他高高地抬在肩膀上，送到首领旁边的尊贵座位上，在那里以隆重的仪式加冕他为斗鸡国王，同时庄严地取消并废除他卑微的头衔，宣称如果之后有人再这么叫，就下令将其逐出该帮。","But poor Hugo stood no chance whatever.His frantic and lubberly ’prentice-work found but a poor market for itself when pitted against an arm which had been trained by the first masters of Europe in single-stick, quarter-staff, and every art and trick of swordsmanship.The little King stood, alert but at graceful ease, and caught and turned aside the thick rain of blows with a facility and precision which set the motley on-lookers wild with admiration; and every now and then, when his practised eye detected an opening, and a lightning-swift rap upon Hugo’s head followed as a result, the storm of cheers and laughter that swept the place was something wonderful to hear.At the end of fifteen minutes, Hugo, all battered, bruised, and the target for a pitiless bombardment of ridicule, slunk from the field; and the unscathed hero of the fight was seized and borne aloft upon the shoulders of the joyous rabble to the place of honour beside the Ruffler, where with vast ceremony he was crowned King of the Game-Cocks; his meaner title being at the same time solemnly cancelled and annulled, and a decree of banishment from the gang pronounced against any who should thenceforth utter it."
"所有使国王为这伙人做事的尝试都以失败告终。他固执地拒绝做事，而且，他总是试图逃跑。回来的第一天，他就被扔进一个无人看管的厨房。他不仅双手空空如也地出来，而且还试图激怒同屋的人。他被派出去给一个补锅匠做帮手，但他不愿干活，还拿着烙铁威胁补锅匠。最后，雨果和补锅匠两个人光顾着看着他，不让他逃跑，没有精力做别的事了。对所有妨碍他自由或强迫他做事的人，他都龙颜大怒。在雨果的监管下，他被派去与一个邋遢的带着患病婴儿的妇女一块儿乞讨，但是结果不那么令人满意。无论如何，他拒绝为乞丐乞讨，或者参与他们的行当。","All attempts to make the King serviceable to the troop had failed.He had stubbornly refused to act; moreover, he was always trying to escape.He had been thrust into an unwatched kitchen, the first day of his return; he not only came forth empty-handed, but tried to rouse the housemates.He was sent out with a tinker to help him at his work; he would not work; moreover, he threatened the tinker with his own soldering-iron; and finally both Hugo and the tinker found their hands full with the mere matter of keeping him from getting away.He delivered the thunders of his royalty upon the heads of all who hampered his liberties or tried to force him to service.He was sent out, in Hugo’s charge, in company with a slatternly woman and a diseased baby, to beg; but the result was not encouraging—he declined to plead for the mendicants, or be a party to their cause in any way."
"就这样过了几天。流浪生活的悲惨，以及由此带来的疲倦、污秽、卑劣和粗俗渐渐让这个俘虏越来越无法忍受，以至于他最后开始觉得，他从隐士刀下逃脱至多不过是暂时的缓期死刑。","Thus several days went by; and the miseries of this tramping life, and the weariness and sordidness and meanness and vulgarity of it, became gradually and steadily so intolerable to the captive that he began at last to feel that his release from the hermit’s knife must prove only a temporary respite from death, at best."
"但在晚上的梦里，这些事情都给忘记了，他又坐在了宝座上，成了主人。当然，这更加重了醒来时的痛苦。于是，从跟雨果那场争斗到他随后被捆绑起来的那几天，每当早晨来临，他的羞辱感越来越强烈，越来越不能忍受。","But at night, in his dreams, these things were forgotten, and he was on his throne, and master again.This, of course, intensified the sufferings of the awakening—so the mortifications of each succeeding morning of the few that passed between his return to bondage and the combat with Hugo, grew bitterer and bitterer, and harder and harder to bear."
"争斗之后的第二天早上，雨果起来了，一心想着要报复国王。他具体有两个计划。一个是对这个家伙高傲的精神和“幻想中”的皇位施加针对性的羞辱。如果这个计划不成功，他另一个计划是让国王犯某种罪行，引诱他落入法律那无情的魔掌中。","The morning after that combat, Hugo got up with a heart filled with vengeful purposes against the King.He had two plans, in particular.One was to inflict upon the lad what would be, to his proud spirit and ‘imagined’ royalty, a peculiar humiliation; and if he failed to accomplish this, his other plan was to put a crime of some kind upon the King, and then betray him into the implacable clutches of the law."
"为了实施第一个计划，他打算给国王的腿制造“气候”，这一定会将国王羞辱到极致并达到完美的程度。一旦“气候”实施顺利，他打算叫坎蒂帮忙，强迫国王在公路上露着腿祈求施舍。“气候”是黑话，意思是人工制造的溃烂。为了制造气候，实施者用生石灰、肥皂和旧铁锈制成浆糊或者膏药，将其涂在一张皮革上，然后将皮革紧紧包在他的腿上。不一会儿，它就会侵蚀皮肤，让肉刺痛，看起来像发炎一样。然后在腿上涂血，等血完全干了，就成了黑的、令人作呕的颜色。接着再聪明地把脏兮兮的破布绷带胡乱地缠在腿上，让可怕的溃疡依稀可见，以博得路人的同情。","In pursuance of the first plan, he purposed to put a ‘clime’ upon the King’s leg; rightly judging that that would mortify him to the last and perfect degree; and as soon as the clime should operate, he meant to get Canty’s help, and force the King to expose his leg in the highway and beg for alms.‘Clime’ was the cant term for a sore, artificially created.To make a clime, the operator made a paste or poultice of unslaked lime, soap, and the rust of old iron, and spread it upon a piece of leather, which was then bound tightly upon the leg.This would presently fret off the skin, and make the flesh raw and angry-looking; blood was then rubbed upon the limb, which, being fully dried, took on a dark and repulsive colour.Then a bandage of soiled rags was put on in a cleverly careless way which would allow the hideous ulcer to be seen, and move the compassion of the passer-by."
"雨果得到了补锅匠的帮助，就是国王拿烙铁吓唬的那个补锅匠。他们说是带着男孩出去熔补，一旦到了营地视线范围之外，他们就把他推倒，补锅匠摁着他，而雨果就将膏药紧紧绑在的国王腿上。","Hugo got the help of the tinker whom the King had cowed with the soldering-iron; they took the boy out on a tinkering tramp, and as soon as they were out of sight of the camp they threw him down and the tinker held him while Hugo bound the poultice tight and fast upon his leg."
"国王暴怒，狂骂着并发誓说，他一回到王位上，便会把这两个人绞死。可是他们紧紧地抓着他，享受他那无能为力的挣扎，嘲笑他的威胁。一切就这样继续，直到膏状物开始侵蚀皮肤。如果没有人来打扰，一会儿这个工作就能完美地结束。但是有人来了，因为正在这时，那个演讲时诋毁英格兰法律的“奴隶”在此出现，终结了这个工作，将膏状物和绷带扯了下来。","The King raged and stormed, and promised to hang the two the moment the sceptre was in his hand again; but they kept a firm grip upon him and enjoyed his impotent struggling and jeered at his threats.This continued until the poultice began to bite; and in no long time its work would have been perfected, if there had been no interruption.But there was; for about this time the ‘slave’ who had made the speech denouncing England’s laws, appeared on the scene, and put an end to the enterprise, and stripped off the poultice and bandage."
"国王想借用救他的人的棍子来当场揍这俩流氓，但那人说不行，这会惹麻烦——把这事留到晚上。到时候，所有人都在，外界不敢来干扰或打断。他带着这几个人回到了营地，并向首领报告了这件事。首领听了思考了一下，然后决定不应该再派国王去乞讨了，因为显然他应该做更高尚和体面的事情。因此，他当场将国王从乞讨的级别晋升为偷的级别！","The King wanted to borrow his deliverer’s cudgel and warm the jackets of the two rascals on the spot; but the man said no, it would bring trouble—leave the matter till night; the whole tribe being together, then, the outside world would not venture to interfere or interrupt.He marched the party back to camp and reported the affair to the Ruffler, who listened, pondered, and then decided that the King should not be again detailed to beg, since it was plain he was worthy of something higher and better—wherefore, on the spot he promoted him from the mendicant rank and appointed him to steal!"
"雨果欣喜若狂。他曾经努力让国王去偷，没有成功，但是现在不再有这个问题了，因为国王当然不会想到要公然反抗总部直接下达的明确的命令吧。于是，他为当天的下午策划了一场抢劫，试图让国王在这个过程中触犯法律。而且，要做这件事也要经过精心设计，让它看起来是偶然和无意的，因为现在斗鸡国王很受人欢迎，谁要是玩这么严重的背叛，将他出卖给法律——他们共同的敌人，那这帮人都不会轻易放过这个不受欢迎的人。","Hugo was overjoyed.He had already tried to make the King steal, and failed; but there would be no more trouble of that sort, now, for of course the King would not dream of defying a distinct command delivered directly from head-quarters.So he planned a raid for that very afternoon, purposing to get the King in the law’s grip in the course of it; and to do it, too, with such ingenious strategy, that it should seem to be accidental and unintentional; for the King of the Game-Cocks was popular now, and the gang might not deal over-gently with an unpopular member who played so serious a treachery upon him as the delivering him over to the common enemy, the law."
"很好。雨果早早地就带着他的猎物往邻村走去。两人慢慢悠悠地走过一条又一条街，一个机警地寻找一个有把握的机会，以达到他那邪恶的目的，另一个机警地观察好寻找一个机会，逃脱这令人厌恶的囚禁，永远获得自由。","Very well.All in good time Hugo strolled off to a neighbouring village with his prey; and the two drifted slowly up and down one street after another, the one watching sharply for a sure chance to achieve his evil purpose, and the other watching as sharply for a chance to dart away and get free of his infamous captivity for ever."
"两人都错失了一些还算不错的机会，因为两人都暗暗下定决心，这次行动必须有十足的把握，于是他们都忍住了强烈的欲望的引诱，没有冒然采取任何没有把握的行动。","Both threw away some tolerably fair-looking opportunities; for both, in their secret hearts, were resolved to make absolutely sure work this time, and neither meant to allow his fevered desires to seduce him into any venture that had much uncertainty about it."
"雨果的机会先来了。因为终于走来一个提着篮子的妇人，篮子里放着一个鼓鼓的包裹。雨果眼睛里闪烁出罪恶的快乐，心想：“我的天啊，我就让他在这儿下手，太好了，上帝保佑你，斗鸡国王！”他等着，观察着，表面上很平静，可内心极其兴奋。等直到妇人走过去，时机成熟，他便轻声说：","Hugo’s chance came first.For at last a woman approached who carried a fat package of some sort in a basket.Hugo’s eyes sparkled with sinful pleasure as he said to himself, “Breath o’ my life, an’ I can but put that upon him, ’tis good-den and God keep thee, King of the Game-Cocks!”He waited and watched—outwardly patient, but inwardly consuming with excitement—till the woman had passed by, and the time was ripe; then said, in a low voice—"
"“在这儿别动，等我回来。”说完就偷偷向猎物追去。","“Tarry here till I come again,” and darted stealthily after the prey."
"国王满心高兴，因为只要雨果追猎物跑得够远，他马上就可以逃跑了。","The King’s heart was filled with joy—he could make his escape, now, if Hugo’s quest only carried him far enough away."
"但他没有那么幸运。雨果蹑手蹑脚地跟在妇人后面，抢了包裹就往回跑，把包裹卷在他搭在胳膊上的一条旧毯子里。妇人立即嚷嚷起来，她觉得身上轻了，于是知道丢了东西，尽管她并没有看见偷的过程。雨果没有停下就把包袱塞到了国王手里，说：","But he was to have no such luck.Hugo crept behind the woman, snatched the package, and came running back, wrapping it in an old piece of blanket which he carried on his arm.The hue and cry was raised in a moment, by the woman, who knew her loss by the lightening of her burden, although she had not seen the pilfering done.Hugo thrust the bundle into the King’s hands without halting, saying—"
"“你快和其他人追我，喊‘抓贼’，但是记住把他们引到另外一条路上！”","“Now speed ye after me with the rest, and cry ‘Stop thief!’ but mind ye lead them astray!”"
"接下来，雨果拐了弯，向一条弯曲的小巷飞奔，紧接着，他又出现在人们视线中，懒洋洋的，一副无辜和冷漠的样子，在一根杆子后面站定了，准备看个究竟。","The next moment Hugo turned a corner and darted down a crooked alley—and in another moment or two he lounged into view again, looking innocent and indifferent, and took up a position behind a post to watch results."
"受到侮辱的国王将包裹扔到地上。正当那妇人过来时，毯子散开了，一群叽叽喳喳的人紧紧地围上来。她一只手抓住国王的手腕，另一只手抓住她的包裹，开始对这男孩子破口大骂，同时男孩子挣扎着想逃脱她的手，但没有成功。","The insulted King threw the bundle on the ground; and the blanket fell away from it just as the woman arrived, with an augmenting crowd at her heels; she seized the King’s wrist with one hand, snatched up her bundle with the other, and began to pour out a tirade of abuse upon the boy while he struggled, without success, to free himself from her grip."
"雨果看够了——他的敌人被逮起来，现在法律会惩罚他。于是他乐呵呵地笑着溜走了，往营地方向走去，边走边想着把这事编成一个合理的版本，来告诉首领们。","Hugo had seen enough—his enemy was captured and the law would get him, now—so he slipped away, jubilant and chuckling, and wended campwards, framing a judicious version of the matter to give to the Ruffler’s crew as he strode along."
"国王继续在妇女的手里挣扎，时不时恼怒地喊道：","The King continued to struggle in the woman’s strong grasp, and now and then cried out in vexation—"
"“放开我，你个愚蠢的家伙，不是我抢了你那不值钱的东西。”","“Unhand me, thou foolish creature; it was not I that bereaved thee of thy paltry goods.”"
"人群凑过来，对国王威胁辱骂。一个肌肉结实的铁匠，穿着皮围裙，袖子卷到胳膊肘上，抓住他，说要好好揍他一顿，给他点教训。但正在此时，一把长剑在空中闪过，刀背朝下有力地落在那人的胳膊上。同时，持剑的大好人笑吟吟地说道：","The crowd closed around, threatening the King and calling him names; a brawny blacksmith in leather apron, and sleeves rolled to his elbows, made a reach for him, saying he would trounce him well, for a lesson; but just then a long sword flashed in the air and fell with convincing force upon the man’s arm, flat side down, the fantastic owner of it remarking pleasantly, at the same time—"
"“啊，善良的灵魂们，让我们采用温柔的方式吧，不要用仇恨和无情的言语。这件事应该由法律来管，不是私人和个人能解决的。放开这个男孩，女士。”","“Marry, good souls, let us proceed gently, not with ill blood and uncharitable words.This is matter for the law’s consideration, not private and unofficial handling.Loose thy hold from the boy, goodwife.”"
"铁匠打量一眼强壮的战士，就边咕哝边揉搓着胳膊走开了，妇人不情愿地放开了男孩的手腕。人群不友善地盯着这个陌生人，但都谨慎地闭了嘴巴。国王跳到救他的人身边，满脸通红，眼睛发亮，大声说道：","The blacksmith averaged the stalwart soldier with a glance, then went muttering away, rubbing his arm; the woman released the boy’s wrist reluctantly; the crowd eyed the stranger unlovingly, but prudently closed their mouths.The King sprang to his deliverer’s side, with flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes, exclaiming—"
"“你来得太晚了，但是你来得正好。现在，迈尔斯先生，替我把这群乌合之众撕成碎片！”","“Thou hast lagged sorely, but thou comest in good season, now, Sir Miles; carve me this rabble to rags!”"
"第二十三章 国君成了阶下囚","Chapter XXIII  The Prince a Prisoner"
"亨登挤出了个笑脸，弯下腰，在国王的耳边悄声说道：","Hendon forced back a smile, and bent down and whispered in the King’s ear—"
"“小声点，小声点，我的君主，小心说话——不，别说话，请别找麻烦。相信我，最后一切都会好的。”然后他又心想：“迈尔斯爵士！天啊，我完全忘记我还是个骑士！主啊，这是多么奇妙的事情，他的记忆力战胜了他那古怪而疯狂的幻想！……我的头衔是空虚和愚蠢的，可是也不无价值，因为我觉得，在他的梦幻和影子王国里做个鬼魂骑士，比在这个真实世界的王国里做个卑微的男爵更为荣耀。","“Softly, softly, my prince, wag thy tongue warily—nay, suffer it not to wag at all.Trust in me—all shall go well in the end.”Then he added to himself: “Sir Miles!Bless me, I had totally forgot I was a knight!Lord, how marvellous a thing it is, the grip his memory doth take upon his quaint and crazy fancies! ...An empty and foolish title is mine, and yet it is something to have deserved it; for I think it is more honour to be held worthy to be a spectre-knight in his Kingdom of Dreams and Shadows, than to be held base enough to be an earl in some of the real kingdoms of this world.”"
"人群分开来给一个警察让路。警察走过来，刚要把手放在国王的肩膀上，亨登突然说：","The crowd fell apart to admit a constable, who approached and was about to lay his hand upon the King’s shoulder, when Hendon said—"
"“轻点，好朋友，拿开你的手。他会乖乖跟你走的，我保证。带路，我们跟在后面。”","“Gently, good friend, withhold your hand—he shall go peaceably; I am responsible for that.Lead on, we will follow.”"
"警官领路，那妇人拿着她的包裹跟在后面，迈尔斯和国王跟随其后，紧跟着他们的还有一群人。国王意欲反抗，但是亨登小声对他说：","The officer led, with the woman and her bundle; Miles and the King followed after, with the crowd at their heels.The King was inclined to rebel; but Hendon said to him in a low voice—"
"“陛下，您想想，您的法律对于您的皇室地位来说就好比是健康的空气。如果法律的源头都违抗它们，怎么还能让那些支流遵守它们呢？我们肯定已经触犯了其中一条法律。当国王再坐到宝座上，想起当他隐藏自己的高贵身份，乔装平民，还要屈服于他自己的权力时，他会悲伤吗？”","“Reflect, Sire—your laws are the wholesome breath of your own royalty; shall their source resist them, yet require the branches to respect them?Apparently one of these laws has been broken; when the King is on his throne again, can it ever grieve him to remember that when he was seemingly a private person he loyally sank the king in the citizen and submitted to its authority?”"
"“你是对的，不用再多说了。你会看到的，当英国国王是平民身份时，他也会接受他要求臣民经受的任何法律惩罚。”","“Thou art right; say no more; thou shalt see that whatsoever the King of England requires a subject to suffer, under the law, he will himself suffer while he holdeth the station of a subject.”"
"妇人被叫到治安法官面前作证时，她发誓说公开受审的这个小犯人就是那个贼。因为没有任何反证，所以国王被认定有罪。现在包裹打开了，里面是一头光溜溜的猪。这时，法官面露忧虑之色，而亨登脸色变得苍白，身体因一股焦虑的电流而颤抖，可是国王依旧平静，无知而无忧。在这个不详的停顿中，法官沉思片刻，然后转向妇人，问道：","When the woman was called upon to testify before the justice of the peace, she swore that the small prisoner at the bar was the person who had committed the theft; there was none able to show the contrary, so the King stood convicted.The bundle was now unrolled, and when the contents proved to be a plump little dressed pig, the judge looked troubled, whilst Hendon turned pale, and his body was thrilled with an electric shiver of dismay; but the King remained unmoved, protected by his ignorance.The judge meditated, during an ominous pause, then turned to the woman, with the question—"
"“你认为这个财产值多少钱？”","“What dost thou hold this property to be worth?”"
"妇人行了礼，答道：","The woman courtesied and replied—"
"“三先令八便士，法官阁下。我一分钱都不能少说，这是真实的价值。”","“Three shillings and eightpence, your worship—I could not abate a penny and set forth the value honestly.”"
"法官不自在地看了一下周围的群众，然后对警察点了点头，说道：","The justice glanced around uncomfortably upon the crowd, then nodded to the constable, and said—"
"“旁听者退出法庭，关门。”","“Clear the court and close the doors.”"
"众人退庭完毕。除了两个警官、被告、原告和迈尔斯·亨登，没有留下其他人。迈尔斯一脸严肃，没有血色，额头上冒出了大颗大颗的汗珠，汗珠又破裂、融合到一起，顺着脸淌了下来。法官又转向妇人，同情地说道：","It was done.None remained but the two officials, the accused, the accuser, and Miles Hendon.This latter was rigid and colourless, and on his forehead big drops of cold sweat gathered, broke and blended together, and trickled down his face.The judge turned to the woman again, and said, in a compassionate voice—"
"“这是个无知的小伙子，可能实在饥饿难忍，因为现在的不幸的人真的很可怜。你看看，他的面相并不邪恶，但是当饥饿难忍时——好心的女士，你知道吗？当偷的东西价值超过十三便士，法律将判他绞刑。”","“’Tis a poor ignorant lad, and mayhap was driven hard by hunger, for these be grievous times for the unfortunate; mark you, he hath not an evil face—but when hunger driveth—Good woman! dost know that when one steals a thing above the value of thirteenpence ha’penny the law saith he shall hang for it?”"
"小国王吃了一惊，惊恐地睁大了眼睛，但是他控制住了自己，保持平静。可是妇人不能平静了。她一跃而起，吓得颤抖起来，喊道：","The little King started, wide-eyed with consternation, but controlled himself and held his peace; but not so the woman.She sprang to her feet, shaking with fright, and cried out—"
"“啊，天啊，我做了什么啊！仁慈的上帝，给我整个世界，我也不愿绞死这可怜的家伙！啊，救我出来，尊敬的法官。我该怎么做，我能做什么？”","“Oh, good lack, what have I done!God-a-mercy, I would not hang the poor thing for the whole world!Ah, save me from this, your worship—what shall I do, what can I do?”"
"法官保持着法庭上应有的沉着，只是说：","The justice maintained his judicial composure, and simply said—"
"“既然我们还没有记下物品的价值，当然还允许修改。”","“Doubtless it is allowable to revise the value, since it is not yet writ upon the record.”"
"“那么，看在上帝的份上，就说这头猪值八便士吧，上天保佑有一日，我的良心可以摆脱这件可怕的事情！”","“Then in God’s name call the pig eightpence, and heaven bless the day that freed my conscience of this awesome thing!”"
"迈尔斯·亨登高兴得忘记了礼仪。他双手拥抱国王，让国王一惊——他冒犯了国王的尊严。妇人感激地道别，领着她的猪离开。警察为她打开门，跟随她走进窄厅里。法官继续写他的记录。一直警觉的亨登想要弄清楚警官为什么跟着那妇人出去，因此他悄悄地溜到昏暗的大厅里听着。他听到的谈话的大意是：","Miles Hendon forgot all decorum in his delight; and surprised the King and wounded his dignity, by throwing his arms around him and hugging him.The woman made her grateful adieux and started away with her pig; and when the constable opened the door for her, he followed her out into the narrow hall.The justice proceeded to write in his record book.Hendon, always alert, thought he would like to know why the officer followed the woman out; so he slipped softly into the dusky hall and listened.He heard a conversation to this effect—"
"“这是一头肥猪，肯定很好吃，你卖给我，给你八便士。”“八便士，真的啊！你不能这么做。它花了我三先令八便士，上个国王的十足货币，那个刚死去的国王从没碰过或是修改过。你的八便士只能买一个无花果！”","“It is a fat pig, and promises good eating; I will buy it of thee; here is the eightpence.”“Eightpence, indeed!Thou’lt do no such thing.It cost me three shillings and eightpence, good honest coin of the last reign, that old Harry that’s just dead ne’er touched or tampered with.A fig for thy eightpence!”"
"“你在那儿说的话是放屁吗？你发了誓的，那么你说价值仅仅八便士的时候是在撒谎。","“Stands the wind in that quarter?Thou wast under oath, and so swore falsely when thou saidst the value was but eightpence."
"马上跟我回到法官面前，为你犯的罪负责！然后，这个家伙就会被绞死。”","Come straightway back with me before his worship, and answer for the crime!—and then the lad will hang.”"
"“好了，好了，亲爱的，别说了，我愿意。给我八便士，就别再提这件事情了。”","“There, there, dear heart, say no more, I am content.Give me the eightpence, and hold thy peace about the matter.”"
"妇人哭着离开了。亨登悄悄地回到法庭上，警察把他的好东西藏在就近的地方，立刻跟了上来。法官又写了一会儿，接着对国王读了一篇智慧、友善的训诫，宣判他在普通监狱里短期囚禁，最后他将当众接受鞭打。国王惊讶地张大了嘴巴，没准要下令当场绞死这个好心的法官。不过，他看到了亨登给他的警告信号，于是又闭上了嘴巴，没说出任何话。现在，亨登马上抓住他的手，向法官致敬，然后两人随着警察朝监狱走去。一走到街上，怒火冲天的国王就停下来，甩脱了他的手，大声说道：","The woman went off crying; Hendon slipped back into the court room, and the constable presently followed, after hiding his prize in some convenient place.The justice wrote a while longer, then read the King a wise and kindly lecture, and sentenced him to a short imprisonment in the common jail, to be followed by a public flogging.The astounded King opened his mouth, and was probably going to order the good judge to be beheaded on the spot; but he caught a warning sign from Hendon, and succeeded in closing his mouth again before he lost anything out of it.Hendon took him by the hand, now, made reverence to the justice, and the two departed in the wake of the constable toward the jail.The moment the street was reached, the inflamed monarch halted, snatched away his hand, and exclaimed—"
"“笨蛋，你以为我会活着进普通监狱吗？”","“Idiot, dost imagine I will enter a common jail alive?”"
"亨登弯腰，有点严厉地说道：","Hendon bent down and said, somewhat sharply—"
"“你能相信我吗？住嘴！别再说危险的话，让我们更倒霉了。上帝愿意的事，就会发生，你不能让它加速，也不能改变它。所以只能等待，耐心地等。当该发生的事情发生之后，有的是时间来抱怨或高兴。”","“Will you trust in me?Peace!and forbear to worsen our chances with dangerous speech.What God wills, will happen; thou canst not hurry it, thou canst not alter it; therefore wait, and be patient—’twill be time enow to rail or rejoice when what is to happen has happened.”"
"第二十四章 逃跑","Chapter XXIV  The Escape"
"冬季的天很短，快要黑了。街上空荡荡的，只剩下稀稀拉拉的几个流浪者。他们匆忙地走着，神情专注，就像那些只求尽快完成差事，好逃离渐起的风和渐浓的暮色，回到自己温暖舒适的家的人们一样。他们既不往右看，也不往后看。他们没注意到我们这几个人，甚至说他们似乎就没有看到。爱德华六世心想，是否也曾有一个国王走向监狱时遭受过如此惊人的冷遇。一会儿，警察来到了废弃的市场广场，开始穿行。当他走到广场的中间时，亨登把手搭在他的胳膊上，低声说：","The short winter day was nearly ended.The streets were deserted, save for a few random stragglers, and these hurried straight along, with the intent look of people who were only anxious to accomplish their errands as quickly as possible, and then snugly house themselves from the rising wind and the gathering twilight.They looked neither to the right nor to the left; they paid no attention to our party, they did not even seem to see them.Edward the Sixth wondered if the spectacle of a king on his way to jail had ever encountered such marvellous indifference before.By-and-by the constable arrived at a deserted market-square, and proceeded to cross it.When he had reached the middle of it, Hendon laid his hand upon his arm, and said in a low voice—"
"“等一下，好心的先生，没有人听着，我想对你说句话。”","“Bide a moment, good sir, there is none in hearing, and I would say a word to thee.”"
"“我的职责不允许，先生。请别妨碍我，天就要黑了。”","“My duty forbids it, sir; prithee hinder me not, the night comes on.”"
"“无论如何，请停下，因为这件事与你密切相关。你转过身去一会儿，就当没看见，让这个可怜的小伙子逃走。”","“Stay, nevertheless, for the matter concerns thee nearly.Turn thy back a moment and seem not to see: LET THIS POOR LAD ESCAPE.”"
"“这是我的事，先生！我要逮捕你——”","“This to me, sir!I arrest thee in—”"
"“不，不要太着急。留心，别犯什么愚蠢的错误。”接着，他压低声音在那人的耳边说，“伙计，你花了八便士买的那头猪可能会要了你的命！”","“Nay, be not too hasty.See thou be careful and commit no foolish error,”—then he shut his voice down to a whisper, and said in the man’s ear—“the pig thou hast purchased for eightpence may cost thee thy neck, man!”"
"这个可怜的警察先是吃了一惊，哑口无言，然后能开口说话了，就大喊大叫着威胁。但是亨登十分镇静，耐心等待他说完，然后接着说道：","The poor constable, taken by surprise, was speechless, at first, then found his tongue and fell to blustering and threatening; but Hendon was tranquil, and waited with patience till his breath was spent; then said—"
"“我有点喜欢你，朋友，所以不愿意看到你受伤害。注意，我全听到了——每一个字。我会证明给你看。”接着他将那警官和妇女在大厅里的谈话重复了一遍，一字不差，最后说：","“I have a liking to thee, friend, and would not willingly see thee come to harm.Observe, I heard it all—every word.I will prove it to thee.”Then he repeated the conversation which the officer and the woman had had together in the hall, word for word, and ended with—"
"“看——我说对了吗？如果情况需要，我是否可以向法官一五一十地陈述呢？”","“There—have I set it forth correctly?Should not I be able to set it forth correctly before the judge, if occasion required?”"
"警察既害怕又沮丧，一时哑口无言。然后，他缓了过来，强装着轻松说：","The man was dumb with fear and distress, for a moment; then he rallied, and said with forced lightness—"
"“虽然这件事很重要，但是这确实是出于玩笑。我只是吓唬那妇人，自己寻开心而已。”","“’Tis making a mighty matter, indeed, out of a jest; I but plagued the woman for mine amusement.”"
"“拿了妇人的猪来寻开心？”","“Kept you the woman’s pig for amusement?”"
"这人尖锐地答道：","The man answered sharply—"
"“没别的，好心的先生，我告诉你，那只是个玩笑。”","“Nought else, good sir—I tell thee ’twas but a jest.”"
"“我确实开始相信你了，”亨登带着半嘲笑半信任的令人迷惑的声调说道，“不过你在这儿等一会儿，我跑去叫法官来，因为不管怎样，他这个人经验丰富，在法律上，在玩笑上，在——”","“I do begin to believe thee,” said Hendon, with a perplexing mixture of mockery and half-conviction in his tone; “but tarry thou here a moment whilst I run and ask his worship—for nathless, he being a man experienced in law, in jests, in—”"
"他拔腿要走，嘴里仍在说着。警察犹豫了，焦躁不安，骂了几句，接着喊道：","He was moving away, still talking; the constable hesitated, fidgeted, spat out an oath or two, then cried out—"
"“等下，等下，好心的先生，请稍等一下，法官！哎呦，先生，他对玩笑和对一具死尸一样没有一点儿同情！过来，我们再商量商量。啊，天啊！我似乎犯了什么错，但全是因为一个天真、轻率的玩笑。我是个有家庭的人，我有老婆和年幼的孩子们。告诉我，善良的阁下，您想拿我怎么办？”","“Hold, hold, good sir—prithee wait a little—the judge!Why, man, he hath no more sympathy with a jest than hath a dead corpse!—come, and we will speak further.Ods body!I seem to be in evil case—and all for an innocent and thoughtless pleasantry.I am a man of family; and my wife and little ones—List to reason, good your worship: what wouldst thou of me?”"
"“除非你是瞎子、哑巴、瘫痪，否则我可以列举上千条——慢慢列举。”亨登说道，脸上带着求人帮个合情合理的忙的表情，而且是很小的忙。","“Only that thou be blind and dumb and paralytic whilst one may count a hundred thousand—counting slowly,” said Hendon, with the expression of a man who asks but a reasonable favour, and that a very little one."
"“这是要毁了我啊！”警察失望地说，“啊，理智点，善良的先生。只要分析下这件事的方方面面，就能明白那是个多小的玩笑——多么明显，多么清楚。即使你不把它看作玩笑，它也是如此小的错误，由它引起的即便是最严厉的惩罚，也只是法官口头上给予斥责和警告而已。”","“It is my destruction!” said the constable despairingly.“Ah, be reasonable, good sir; only look at this matter, on all its sides, and see how mere a jest it is—how manifestly and how plainly it is so.And even if one granted it were not a jest, it is a fault so small that e’en the grimmest penalty it could call forth would be but a rebuke and warning from the judge’s lips.”"
"亨登的回答带着严肃的语气，使得周围的空气都冷却了：","Hendon replied with a solemnity which chilled the air about him—"
"“你这种玩笑在法律上是有说法的，你知道是什么吗？”","“This jest of thine hath a name, in law,—wot you what it is?”"
"“我不知道！或许我真是愚蠢。我从没想过它还有说法——啊，天啊，我以为这是独创的。”“是的，它有说法的。此罪行在法律上叫做疯子报仇欺世罪。”","“I knew it not!Peradventure I have been unwise.I never dreamed it had a name—ah, sweet heaven, I thought it was original.”“Yes, it hath a name.In the law this crime is called Non compos mentis lex talionis sic transit gloria mundi.”"
"“啊，我的天！”","“Ah, my God!”"
"“而惩罚是死刑！”","“And the penalty is death!”"
"“上帝怜悯我这个罪人！”","“God be merciful to me a sinner!”"
"“你利用一个犯了错、处于极端危险之中的人，以你的权力夺取了价值高于十三便士的东西，却只付了很少的钱。从法律上来看，这是蓄意欺诈、叛国渎职、玩忽职守、是以前说的徇私枉法，而相应的刑罚是处以绞刑，而且不得赎身、减刑或请牧师求情。”","“By advantage taken of one in fault, in dire peril, and at thy mercy, thou hast seized goods worth above thirteenpence ha’penny, paying but a trifle for the same; and this, in the eye of the law, is constructive barratry, misprision of treason, malfeasance in office, adhominem expurgatis in statu quo—and the penalty is death by the halter, without ransom, commutation, or benefit of clergy.”"
"“扶我一下，扶我一下，善良的先生，我的双腿发软！您大慈大悲，让我逃过这次厄运吧，我会转过身，就当看不到即将发生的事。”","“Bear me up, bear me up, sweet sir, my legs do fail me!Be thou merciful—spare me this doom, and I will turn my back and see nought that shall happen.”"
"“好！你现在聪明理智了。你会交还那只猪吧？”","“Good!now thou’rt wise and reasonable.And thou’lt restore the pig?”"
"“我会的，我真的会的，即使上天再送一只来，大天使抓住它，我也不会再碰它了。走，为了你们，我就当眼睛瞎了——我什么都看不到。我会说你闯进来，强行从我手里抢走了囚犯。那只是一扇破破烂烂的旧门。半夜之后，天亮之前，我会把它砸倒。","“I will, I will indeed—nor ever touch another, though heaven send it and an archangel fetch it.Go—I am blind for thy sake—I see nothing.I will say thou didst break in and wrest the prisoner from my hands by force.It is but a crazy, ancient door—I will batter it down myself betwixt midnight and the morning.”"
"“就这么做，善良的灵魂，你不会因此有什么伤害。法官对这个可怜的男孩有慈爱之心，不会因为他的逃跑而流泪，也不会打断狱卒的腿。”","“Do it, good soul, no harm will come of it; the judge hath a loving charity for this poor lad, and will shed no tears and break no jailer’s bones for his escape.”"
"第二十五章 亨登庄园","Chapter XXV  Hendon Hall"
"亨登和国王一走出那警察的视线，国王陛下就按照亨登的意思匆匆赶往城外一处等着他，而亨登到旅馆去结清他的帐。半个小时之后，这两位朋友愉快地骑着亨登可怜的马，慢慢朝东走去。现在，国王感到既温暖又舒适，因为他扔掉了破旧衣服，穿上了亨登在伦敦桥给他买的二手衣服。","As soon as Hendon and the King were out of sight of the constable, his Majesty was instructed to hurry to a certain place outside the town, and wait there, whilst Hendon should go to the inn and settle his account.Half an hour later the two friends were blithely jogging eastward on Hendon’s sorry steeds.The King was warm and comfortable, now, for he had cast his rags and clothed himself in the second-hand suit which Hendon had bought on London Bridge."
"亨登不想让男孩过度劳累。他觉得，辛苦的旅途、不规律的用餐和睡眠不足不利于他疯癫的精神状态，而休息、规律的作息和适当的锻炼肯定能加速病情的好转。他渴望看到他受伤的神智恢复，希望病中的那些幻觉从那受尽折磨的小脑袋中消失。因此，尽管被放逐离家了那么久，他还是按捺住迫不及待的心情，放弃日夜赶路的想法，决定不急不忙地往家走。","Hendon wished to guard against over-fatiguing the boy; he judged that hard journeys, irregular meals, and illiberal measures of sleep would be bad for his crazed mind; whilst rest, regularity, and moderate exercise would be pretty sure to hasten its cure; he longed to see the stricken intellect made well again and its diseased visions driven out of the tormented little head; therefore he resolved to move by easy stages toward the home whence he had so long been banished, instead of obeying the impulse of his impatience and hurrying along night and day."
"当他和国王走了大约十英里时，到了一个大村庄。他们停下来，在一家不错的旅馆过夜。他们又恢复了原来的关系。国王吃饭时，亨登站在他椅子后面伺候着；国王要就寝时，他为他宽衣，而他自己就睡在地板上，裹着一条毛毯，横在门口。","When he and the King had journeyed about ten miles, they reached a considerable village, and halted there for the night, at a good inn.The former relations were resumed; Hendon stood behind the King’s chair, while he dined, and waited upon him; undressed him when he was ready for bed; then took the floor for his own quarters, and slept athwart the door, rolled up in a blanket."
"第二天，第三天，他们一边懒洋洋地行走，一边谈着他们分开后的奇遇,都觉得对方的经历十分有趣。亨登仔细地讲述他千里迢迢寻找国王，讲到大天使如何骗他绕遍了森林，最后大天使发现甩不掉他，又带他回到了棚屋的经历。接着，他说那老人走进卧室，却摇摇晃晃地走出来，一副心碎了的样子，说他本来以为男孩子回来了，躺在那儿休息，但事实却不是这样的。亨登在棚屋等了一整天，国王回来的希望破灭了，于是他又上路寻找。","The next day, and the day after, they jogged lazily along talking over the adventures they had met since their separation, and mightily enjoying each other’s narratives.Hendon detailed all his wide wanderings in search of the King, and described how the archangel had led him a fool’s journey all over the forest, and taken him back to the hut, finally, when he found he could not get rid of him.Then—he said—the old man went into the bedchamber and came staggering back looking broken-hearted, and saying he had expected to find that the boy had returned and laid down in there to rest, but it was not so.Hendon had waited at the hut all day; hope of the King’s return died out, then, and he departed upon the quest again."
"“陛下没有回去，至圣所老人真的很伤心，”亨登说，“我从他的脸上能看得出来。”","“And old Sanctum Sanctorum WAS truly sorry your highness came not back,” said Hendon; “I saw it in his face.”"
"“哎呀，对此我绝不会怀疑的！”国王说道，然后讲述自己的故事。亨登听完，后悔没有杀了大天使。","“Marry I will never doubt that!”said the King—and then told his own story; after which, Hendon was sorry he had not destroyed the archangel."
"旅程的最后一天，亨登的心情十分欢欣。他一直说个不停。他讲到了他的老父亲和他的哥哥阿瑟，讲了很多体现他们的高尚慷慨的事情。他狂热地爱恋伊迪丝，他是那么的高兴，他甚至能够说关于休的一些温暖的兄弟情义。他不停地说着就要见到的亨登庄园。这对大家会是怎样的一个惊喜啊，会是怎样一副令人感激和高兴的场面啊。","During the last day of the trip, Hendon’s spirits were soaring.His tongue ran constantly.He talked about his old father, and his brother Arthur, and told of many things which illustrated their high and generous characters; he went into loving frenzies over his Edith, and was so glad-hearted that he was even able to say some gentle and brotherly things about Hugh.He dwelt a deal on the coming meeting at Hendon Hall; what a surprise it would be to everybody, and what an outburst of thanksgiving and delight there would be."
"这是个美丽的地方，到处是屋舍和果园，道路穿过广袤的草地。草地向后延伸，时不时温柔地起伏着，像是大海时涨时落的波浪。下午，这个归来的浪子总是往远方眺望，看视线是否可以越过这些小山，远远地望一眼他的家。他终于成功了，兴奋地喊道：","It was a fair region, dotted with cottages and orchards, and the road led through broad pasture lands whose receding expanses, marked with gentle elevations and depressions, suggested the swelling and subsiding undulations of the sea.In the afternoon the returning prodigal made constant deflections from his course to see if by ascending some hillock he might not pierce the distance and catch a glimpse of his home.At last he was successful, and cried out excitedly—"
"“就是那个村庄，我的君王，附近就是庄园！你从这儿可以看到那些塔，还有那里的树——那是我父亲的花园。啊，你马上就会知道什么叫做庄严和宏伟了！一座拥有七十间屋的房子，还有二十七个仆人，想想吧！","“There is the village, my Prince, and there is the Hall close by!You may see the towers from here; and that wood there—that is my father’s park.Ah, now thou’lt know what state and grandeur be!A house with seventy rooms—think of that!—and seven and twenty servants!"
"对于我们这种模样的人，这算是奢侈的住宿了，不是吗？来，我们快点，我迫不及待，不能再耽搁了。","A brave lodging for such as we, is it not so?Come, let us speed—my impatience will not brook further delay.”"
"他们已经尽了全力赶路，但到达村庄之时也已过三点了。旅者奔跑着穿过村庄，一路上亨登说个不停。“这是教堂，还是被那些常青藤覆盖着，没有变少，也没有变多。”“那是旅馆，老红狮，那里还有市场。”“这是五月柱，这是水泵。一切都没变化，除了人们多多少少变了。十年会改变人们，我似乎认识一些人，但是没人认得我。”他滔滔不绝。他们很快走到了村庄的尽头。随后，旅者转入一条狭窄蜿蜒的小路上，小路两边竖着高高的篱笆墙。二人沿路匆忙而轻快地走了半英里，接着穿过一扇庄严的大门，大门巨大的石柱雕刻着盾牌。然后，他们进入了一处开阔的花园。一座富丽堂皇的宅第出现在他们面前。","All possible hurry was made; still, it was after three o’clock before the village was reached.The travellers scampered through it, Hendon’s tongue going all the time.“Here is the church—covered with the same ivy—none gone, none added.”“Yonder is the inn, the old Red Lion,—and yonder is the market-place.”“Here is the Maypole, and here the pump—nothing is altered; nothing but the people, at any rate; ten years make a change in people; some of these I seem to know, but none know me.”So his chat ran on.The end of the village was soon reached; then the travellers struck into a crooked, narrow road, walled in with tall hedges, and hurried briskly along it for half a mile, then passed into a vast flower garden through an imposing gateway, whose huge stone pillars bore sculptured armorial devices.A noble mansion was before them."
"“欢迎到亨登庄园来，我的国王！”迈尔斯大声说道。“啊，伟大的一天！父亲和哥哥，还有伊迪丝小姐会高兴得发疯，他们刚见到我会十分激动，只会看着我，和我说话，所以像是冷落了你。不过别介意，很快就会变了，因为当我说你是我守护的人，并告诉他们我对你的爱多么珍贵，你就会看到他们因为迈尔斯·亨登而喜欢你，从此永远让你以此处为家，永远喜欢你！”","“Welcome to Hendon Hall, my King!” exclaimed Miles.“Ah,’tis a great day!My father and my brother, and the Lady Edith will be so mad with joy that they will have eyes and tongue for none but me in the first transports of the meeting, and so thou’lt seem but coldly welcomed—but mind it not; ’twill soon seem otherwise; for when I say thou art my ward, and tell them how costly is my love for thee, thou’lt see them take thee to their breasts for Miles Hendon’s sake, and make their house and hearts thy home for ever after!”"
"接着，亨登跳到了一座宏伟的大门前，扶着国王走下去，然后拉着他的手，跑了进去。走了几步，他们就到了一处宽敞的厅堂。他进去，急忙让国王坐下，没顾上礼节，然后他又朝坐在写字台旁的一个年轻男人跑去。写字台就在烧得正旺的柴火的前面。","The next moment Hendon sprang to the ground before the great door, helped the King down, then took him by the hand and rushed within.A few steps brought him to a spacious apartment; he entered, seated the King with more hurry than ceremony, then ran toward a young man who sat at a writing-table in front of a generous fire of logs."
"“拥抱我，休，”他喊道，“说我回来你很高兴！叫我们的父亲，因为如果我摸不到他的手，看不到他的脸，又听不到他的声音，家就不是家！”","“Embrace me, Hugh,” he cried, “and say thou’rt glad I am come again!and call our father, for home is not home till I shall touch his hand, and see his face, and hear his voice once more!”"
"但是休一时惊奇，只是往后缩，朝入侵者投去严肃的目光——先是一种被冒犯的眼神，接着由于某种内心的想法或目的，变成了一种奇妙的好奇的眼神，夹杂着真实的或是假装的同情。片刻，他柔和地说：","But Hugh only drew back, after betraying a momentary surprise, and bent a grave stare upon the intruder—a stare which indicated somewhat of offended dignity, at first, then changed, in response to some inward thought or purpose, to an expression of marvelling curiosity, mixed with a real or assumed compassion.Presently he said, in a mild voice—"
"“你似乎精神失常了，可怜的陌生人，怪不得你在世人的手里遭受贫困和残酷的虐待。你的面容和衣服已经说明了这一点。你把我当成谁了？”","“Thy wits seem touched, poor stranger; doubtless thou hast suffered privations and rude buffetings at the world’s hands; thy looks and dress betoken it.Whom dost thou take me to be?”"
"“当成谁？请问除了你自己，还能是谁？我把你当成休·亨登。”迈尔斯大声说。","“Take thee?Prithee for whom else than whom thou art?I take thee to be Hugh Hendon,” said Miles, sharply."
"对方继续轻柔地说：","The other continued, in the same soft tone—"
"“那么你想象你自己是谁？”","“And whom dost thou imagine thyself to be?”"
"“想象跟这个没关系！你假装不认识我，你的哥哥迈尔斯·亨登吗？”","“Imagination hath nought to do with it!Dost thou pretend thou knowest me not for thy brother Miles Hendon?”"
"一阵惊喜的表情滑过休的脸，他叫道：","An expression of pleased surprise flitted across Hugh’s face, and he exclaimed—"
"“什么！你在开玩笑吗？死人能复活吗？假如能的话，感谢上帝！这么多令人痛苦的年月过去了，我们失去的可怜的孩子回到了我们的怀抱中！啊，这似乎好过头了，难以置信，真的好得令人难以置信。我请你发发慈悲，别跟我开玩笑！快，到亮处来，让我好好看看你！”","“What! thou art not jesting? can the dead come to life?God be praised if it be so!Our poor lost boy restored to our arms after all these cruel years!Ah, it seems too good to be true, it IS too good to be true—I charge thee, have pity, do not trifle with me!Quick—come to the light—let me scan thee well!”"
"他抓住迈尔斯的胳膊，将他拽到窗前，开始拿眼贪婪地从头到脚打量他，把他转过来转过去，围着他轻快地转啊转，来从各个角度证明就是他。而此时，归来的浪子高兴得容光焕发，微笑，大笑，不断地点头，说：","He seized Miles by the arm, dragged him to the window, and began to devour him from head to foot with his eyes, turning him this way and that, and stepping briskly around him and about him to prove him from all points of view; whilst the returned prodigal, all aglow with gladness, smiled, laughed, and kept nodding his head and saying—"
"“继续，弟弟，继续，别害怕，你不会找到不符合的四肢和特征。随便怎么看，怎么检查，我好心的老休，我确实是你的老迈尔斯，没变的老迈尔斯，你失去的哥哥，不是吗？啊，多棒的一天——我说这是多棒的一天啊！给我你的手，给我你的脸颊——主啊，我好像高兴得要死了！”","“Go on, brother, go on, and fear not; thou’lt find nor limb nor feature that cannot bide the test.Scour and scan me to thy content, my good old Hugh—I am indeed thy old Miles, thy same old Miles, thy lost brother, is’t not so?Ah, ’tis a great day—I said ’twas a great day!Give me thy hand, give me thy cheek—lord, I am like to die of very joy!”"
"他正要拥抱他的弟弟，可是休抬起手拒绝了，然后悲伤地将下巴埋到胸前，激动地说：","He was about to throw himself upon his brother; but Hugh put up his hand in dissent, then dropped his chin mournfully upon his breast, saying with emotion—"
"“啊，上帝慈悲，赐予我力量，让我承受这悲伤的噩耗！”","“Ah, God of his mercy give me strength to bear this grievous disappointment!”"
"迈尔斯很吃惊，一时说不出话来。接着他回过神，喊道：","Miles, amazed, could not speak for a moment; then he found his tongue, and cried out—"
"“什么噩耗？我不是你哥哥吗？”","“What disappointment?Am I not thy brother?”"
"休悲伤地摇摇头，说:","Hugh shook his head sadly, and said—"
"“我向天祈祷希望你是他，希望别人能看到我看不到的相似点。天啊，恐怕那封信说得太真实了。”","“I pray heaven it may prove so, and that other eyes may find the resemblances that are hid from mine.Alack, I fear me the letter spoke but too truly.”"
"“什么信？”","“What letter?”"
"“大概六七年前，一封漂洋过海来的信。信上说我哥哥死在了战场上。”","“One that came from over sea, some six or seven years ago.It said my brother died in battle.”"
"“那是谎言！叫你父亲来，他会认我。”","“It was a lie!Call thy father—he will know me.”"
"“你无法叫一个死人。”","“One may not call the dead.”"
"“死人？”迈尔斯的声音变低了，他的嘴唇发抖。“我父亲死了！啊，这真是噩耗。刚才的高兴现在没了一半。请让我见我的哥哥阿瑟，他会认我。他不仅会认我，还会安慰我。”","“Dead?”Miles’s voice was subdued, and his lips trembled.“My father dead!—oh, this is heavy news.Half my new joy is withered now.Prithee let me see my brother Arthur—he will know me; he will know me and console me.”"
"“他也死了。”","“He, also, is dead.”"
"“上帝可怜我这个不幸的人！走了，都走了，好人都走了，留下无用的人给我！啊！我祈求你的仁慈！不要说伊迪丝小姐——”","“God be merciful to me, a stricken man!Gone,—both gone—the worthy taken and the worthless spared, in me!Ah!I crave your mercy!—do not say the Lady Edith—”"
"“死了？不，她活着。”“那么，感谢上帝，我又开心起来了！快点，弟弟，叫她来见我！她说我不是我，可是她不会这么说的。不，不，她会认得我，我真是个傻瓜，竟然还对此怀疑。带她来，带老仆人们来，他们也会认得我。”","“Is dead?No, she lives.”“Then, God be praised, my joy is whole again!Speed thee, brother—let her come to me!An’ she say I am not myself—but she will not; no, no, she will know me, I were a fool to doubt it.Bring her—bring the old servants; they, too, will know me.”"
"“所有人都死了，只剩下五个——彼得、哈尔西、大卫、伯纳德和玛格丽特。”","“All are gone but five—Peter, Halsey, David, Bernard, and Margaret.”"
"休说着，离开了房间。迈尔斯站着沉默了一会儿，开始在地板上踱来踱去，嘴里咕哝道：","So saying, Hugh left the room.Miles stood musing a while, then began to walk the floor, muttering—"
"“这五个大恶棍比那二十二个忠厚老实的人活得长，这真是荒唐的事情。”","“The five arch-villains have survived the two-and-twenty leal and honest—’tis an odd thing.”"
"他继续踱来踱去，自言自语，完全忘记了国王。过了一会儿，陛下严肃而动情地开口了，虽然这些话有可能被解释成有点讽刺意味:","He continued walking back and forth, muttering to himself; he had forgotten the King entirely.By-and-by his Majesty said gravely, and with a touch of genuine compassion, though the words themselves were capable of being interpreted ironically—"
"“别介意你的不幸，好心的人。世界上还有些人，他们的身份得不到认同，他们的言语受到嘲笑。你有同伴。”","“Mind not thy mischance, good man; there be others in the world whose identity is denied, and whose claims are derided.Thou hast company.”"
"“啊，我的国王，”亨登喊道，脸微微发红，“你不要给我定罪。等着，你会知道的。她会说我不是冒名顶替者的，你将从英国最美丽的口中听到这句话。我是冒名顶替者？为什么，我知道这座古老的房子，我祖先的这些画，我知道关于我们的所有事请，就像孩子了解他自己的温床那样。我在这里出生，长大，我的陛下。我说的是真话，我不会骗你。如果其他人都不信我，我求您别怀疑我，这会使我不堪忍受。”","“Ah, my King,” cried Hendon, colouring slightly, “do not thou condemn me—wait, and thou shalt see.I am no impostor—she will say it; you shall hear it from the sweetest lips in England.I an impostor?Why, I know this old hall, these pictures of my ancestors, and all these things that are about us, as a child knoweth its own nursery.Here was I born and bred, my lord; I speak the truth; I would not deceive thee; and should none else believe, I pray thee do not thou doubt me—I could not bear it.”"
"“我不怀疑你。”国王带着孩子般的干脆和信任说道。","“I do not doubt thee,” said the King, with a childlike simplicity and faith."
"“我从心里感谢你！”亨登热情地喊道，说明他感动了。国王又像刚才一样带着温柔的干脆说:","“I thank thee out of my heart!”exclaimed Hendon with a fervency which showed that he was touched.The King added, with the same gentle simplicity—"
"“你怀疑我吗？”","“Dost thou doubt me?”"
"亨登感到一阵内疚的困惑。他庆幸这时门开了，休走了进来，省掉了他回答的必要。","A guilty confusion seized upon Hendon, and he was grateful that the door opened to admit Hugh, at that moment, and saved him the necessity of replying."
"一位穿着富贵的美丽女士跟着休进来，后面跟随几个穿制服的仆人。女士走得很慢，头低着，眼睛盯着地板。脸上的悲伤难以言表。迈尔斯·亨登跑上前去，喊道:","A beautiful lady, richly clothed, followed Hugh, and after her came several liveried servants.The lady walked slowly, with her head bowed and her eyes fixed upon the floor.The face was unspeakably sad.Miles Hendon sprang forward, crying out—"
"“啊，我的伊迪丝，我亲爱的——”","“Oh, my Edith, my darling—”"
"可是休挥手示意让他退回去，对女士严肃地说:“看看他。你认识他吗？”","But Hugh waved him back, gravely, and said to the lady—“Look upon him.Do you know him?”"
"听到迈尔斯的声音，妇人微微一惊，脸上泛起红晕，身子发抖起来。在令人生畏的片刻停顿中，她静静地站着，然后慢慢抬起头，盯着亨登的眼睛，眼神冷酷而恐惧。血色从她脸上一点一点地褪去，直到只剩下死亡的灰白色。然后，她用像她的脸色一样死气沉沉的声音说道：“我不认识他！”然后她转过身去，悲叹一声，带着压抑的抽噎蹒跚地走出了房间。","At the sound of Miles’s voice the woman had started slightly, and her cheeks had flushed; she was trembling now.She stood still, during an impressive pause of several moments; then slowly lifted up her head and looked into Hendon’s eyes with a stony and frightened gaze; the blood sank out of her face, drop by drop, till nothing remained but the grey pallor of death; then she said, in a voice as dead as the face, “I know him not!”and turned, with a moan and a stifled sob, and tottered out of the room."
"迈尔斯·亨登沉坐在椅子上，双手捂住脸。片刻停顿后，他的弟弟对仆人说:","Miles Hendon sank into a chair and covered his face with his hands.After a pause, his brother said to the servants—"
"“你们已经看过他了。你们认识他吗？”","“You have observed him.Do you know him?”"
"他们摇摇头。主人接着说:","They shook their heads; then the master said—"
"“仆人们不认识你，先生。恐怕有些误会。你已经见了我夫人，她不认识你。”","“The servants know you not, sir.I fear there is some mistake.You have seen that my wife knew you not.”"
"“你的夫人！”休一下子被摁到墙上，铁拳头就在他的喉咙边。“哦，你个狡猾的狐狸，我全明白了！是你写了这封骗人的信，夺取我的新娘，霸占我的家产。好了，立刻滚开，省得我杀死你这可耻的侏儒，侮辱了我高尚的军人身份！”","“Thy wife!”In an instant Hugh was pinned to the wall, with an iron grip about his throat.“Oh, thou fox-hearted slave, I see it all!Thou’st writ the lying letter thyself, and my stolen bride and goods are its fruit.There—now get thee gone, lest I shame mine honourable soldiership with the slaying of so pitiful a mannikin!”"
"休脸满脸通红，几乎窒息，摇摇晃晃地走到离他最近的椅子上，命仆人们把这个杀气腾腾的陌生人抓住绑起来。仆人踌躇不前，其中一个说:","Hugh, red-faced, and almost suffocated, reeled to the nearest chair, and commanded the servants to seize and bind the murderous stranger.They hesitated, and one of them said—"
"“他有武器，休先生，我们没有武器。”","“He is armed, Sir Hugh, and we are weaponless.”"
"“有武器！那又怎么样，你们不是有这么多人吗？抓住他，我说的！”","“Armed!What of it, and ye so many?Upon him, I say!”"
"但是迈尔斯警告他们小心自己的行为，又说：“你们早就了解我，我没有变。过来，我的武器喜欢你们。”","But Miles warned them to be careful what they did, and added—“Ye know me of old—I have not changed; come on, an’ it like you.”"
"这些话没有让仆人们振作多少，他们仍旧后退。","This reminder did not hearten the servants much; they still held back."
"“上啊，你们这些没用的胆小鬼，抄家伙，守住门，派一个去叫守卫来！”休说。","“Then go, ye paltry cowards, and arm yourselves and guard the doors, whilst I send one to fetch the watch!”said Hugh."
"他转向门边，对迈尔斯说：“你别妄图逃跑，这对你有好处，你知道的。”","He turned at the threshold, and said to Miles, “You’ll find it to your advantage to offend not with useless endeavours at escape.”"
"“逃跑？如果这就是你所担心的，那你就放心吧。因为迈尔斯·亨登是亨登庄园和其中所有财产的主人。他不会走，你不用怀疑。”","“Escape?Spare thyself discomfort, an’ that is all that troubles thee.For Miles Hendon is master of Hendon Hall and all its belongings.He will remain—doubt it not.”"
"第二十六章 遭遇矢口否认","Chapter XXVI  Disowned"
"国王坐着沉默了片刻，然后抬起头，说道：","The King sat musing a few moments, then looked up and said—"
"“这很奇怪——太奇怪了。我无法解释这件事。”","“’Tis strange—most strange.I cannot account for it.”"
"“不，这不奇怪，我的君主。我了解他，这种行为只是他的本性。他从出生起就是个流氓。”","“No, it is not strange, my liege.I know him, and this conduct is but natural.He was a rascal from his birth.”"
"“哦，我不是说他，迈尔斯先生。”","“Oh, I spake not of him, Sir Miles.”"
"“不是说他？那是说什么？什么奇怪？”","“Not of him?Then of what?What is it that is strange?”"
"“国王没有失踪。”","“That the King is not missed.”"
"“怎么？什么？我想我没听明白。”","“How?Which?I doubt I do not understand.”"
"“真的？我失踪了，却没有到处看到信使和描述我样貌的公告在寻找我，你不觉得奇怪吗？一个国家的元首失踪了，我消失了，不见了，难道不会引起骚动和悲伤吗？”","“Indeed?Doth it not strike you as being passing strange that the land is not filled with couriers and proclamations describing my person and making search for me?Is it no matter for commotion and distress that the Head of the State is gone; that I am vanished away and lost?”"
"“是的，我的国王，我忘了。”亨登叹息一声，自言自语地咕哝道：“可怜的疯脑袋，还在想着那可悲的梦。”","“Most true, my King, I had forgot.”Then Hendon sighed, and muttered to himself, “Poor ruined mind—still busy with its pathetic dream.”"
"“不过我有一个计划，可以让我们都各归各位。我用拉丁文、希腊文和英文三种语言写一封信，你明天早上赶快将它送到伦敦去。不要给别人，给我舅舅赫特福德伯爵。他看到信时，就会知道，会说是我写的。然后他会派人来找我。”","“But I have a plan that shall right us both—I will write a paper, in three tongues—Latin, Greek and English—and thou shalt haste away with it to London in the morning.Give it to none but my uncle, the Lord Hertford; when he shall see it, he will know and say I wrote it.Then he will send for me.”"
"“或许我们最好在这里等着，等到我证明了自己的身份，维护了我的权利，夺回了财产，是不是，我的陛下？到时我就更能够——”","“Might it not be best, my Prince, that we wait here until I prove myself and make my rights secure to my domains?I should be so much the better able then to—”"
"国王专横地打断了他：","The King interrupted him imperiously—"
"“住嘴！与关乎国家的安危和帝位完好的事相比，你那些微不足道的财产，你那些无足挂齿的利益算得了什么？”然后，他好像因为刚才的严厉感到抱歉，于是又温柔地说：“按照我说的做，不要害怕。我会还原你的身份，我会让你无所不缺——是的，还不只是是无所不缺。我会记得，会报答。”","“Peace!What are thy paltry domains, thy trivial interests, contrasted with matters which concern the weal of a nation and the integrity of a throne?”Then, he added, in a gentle voice, as if he were sorry for his severity, “Obey, and have no fear; I will right thee, I will make thee whole—yes, more than whole.I shall remember, and requite.”"
"说着，他拿起笔开始写信。亨登慈爱地凝视了他一会儿，然后自言自语说：","So saying, he took the pen, and set himself to work.Hendon contemplated him lovingly a while, then said to himself—"
"“如果天黑一些，我可能会相信这是一个国王在说话。不得不承认，当他来了那股劲儿，雷厉风行的时候，确实像个真正的国王。他是从哪里学的这些把戏？看他满意地胡写乱画一些没有意义、歪歪扭扭的文字，还以为是拉丁文和希腊文。除非我有智慧想出改变他的主意的好办法，否则我就必须假装明天去跑他给我安排的这趟鬼差事。”","“An’ it were dark, I should think it WAS a king that spoke; there’s no denying it, when the humour’s upon on him he doth thunder and lighten like your true King; now where got he that trick?See him scribble and scratch away contentedly at his meaningless pot-hooks, fancying them to be Latin and Greek—and except my wit shall serve me with a lucky device for diverting him from his purpose, I shall be forced to pretend to post away to-morrow on this wild errand he hath invented for me.”"
"迈尔斯的思绪马上又回到了眼前的状况。他陷入了深深的沉思，以至于不一会儿国王递给他自己写的信时，他接了过来放进兜里，却没有意识到自己这一系列的动作。“她的行为多么奇怪啊，”他咕哝道，“我觉得她认出了我——我觉得她没有认出我来。显然，这两个观点相悖，而我不能调解它们，我也不能通过辩论放弃其中任何一个，甚至不能说服自己一个胜过另一个。事情只能是这样：她一定认出了我的脸，我的身影，我的声音，因为她怎么可能认不出来？但是她说她不认识我，这就是十足的证据，因为她不可能说谎。不过等一下，我想我开始明白了。可能是他影响的，他命令她，逼迫她撒谎。这就是答案。谜底被解开了。她看起来怕得要死——是的，她受到了他的压迫。我要找到她，我会找到她的。既然他走开了，她会说出真话的。她会记起旧时我们是一起玩耍的小伙伴，这会让她心软，不会再出卖我，而是承认我了。她生来就不会骗人——不会，她总是诚实和真实的。那些远去的日子里，她曾经爱过我。这使我感到安心，因为一个人不能出卖自己曾经爱过的人。”","The next moment Sir Miles’s thoughts had gone back to the recent episode.So absorbed was he in his musings, that when the King presently handed him the paper which he had been writing, he received it and pocketed it without being conscious of the act.“How marvellous strange she acted,” he muttered.“I think she knew me—and I think she did not know me.These opinions do conflict, I perceive it plainly; I cannot reconcile them, neither can I, by argument, dismiss either of the two, or even persuade one to outweigh the other.The matter standeth simply thus: she must have known my face, my figure, my voice, for how could it be otherwise?Yet she said she knew me not, and that is proof perfect, for she cannot lie.But stop—I think I begin to see.Peradventure he hath influenced her, commanded her, compelled her to lie.That is the solution.The riddle is unriddled.She seemed dead with fear—yes, she was under his compulsion.I will seek her; I will find her; now that he is away, she will speak her true mind.She will remember the old times when we were little playfellows together, and this will soften her heart, and she will no more betray me, but will confess me.There is no treacherous blood in her—no, she was always honest and true.She has loved me, in those old days—this is my security; for whom one has loved, one cannot betray.”"
"他急匆匆地朝门口走去。这时门开了，伊迪丝女士走了进来。她脸色苍白，但是步伐矫健，神态十分优雅，温柔高贵。她的脸仍旧如刚才一样悲伤。","He stepped eagerly toward the door; at that moment it opened, and the Lady Edith entered.She was very pale, but she walked with a firm step, and her carriage was full of grace and gentle dignity.Her face was as sad as before."
"迈尔斯带着愉悦的自信上前见她，但是她只是用让人难以察觉的姿势看了他一眼，而他就在那儿站住了。她坐下，也叫他坐下。就这样，如此简单地就将他老朋友的感觉抹去了，把他变成了一个陌生人，一个客人。惊奇、始料不及的困惑一时间让他开始怀疑，究竟自己是不是自己所声称的人。伊迪丝女士开口说：","Miles sprang forward, with a happy confidence, to meet her, but she checked him with a hardly perceptible gesture, and he stopped where he was.She seated herself, and asked him to do likewise.Thus simply did she take the sense of old comradeship out of him, and transform him into a stranger and a guest.The surprise of it, the bewildering unexpectedness of it, made him begin to question, for a moment, if he WAS the person he was pretending to be, after all.The Lady Edith said—"
"“先生，我是来警告你的。也许我不可能说服疯子走出他的幻觉，但是毫无疑问，我可以说服他们避免危险。我觉得，你的幻觉在你看来是真实的，因此不是犯罪，但是不要带着它在这儿逗留，因为在这儿会有危险。”她目不转睛地盯着迈尔斯的脸看了一会儿，又令人害怕地说道：“你跟我们失去的男孩的模样特别像，如果他还活着的话，这就更危险了。”","“Sir, I have come to warn you.The mad cannot be persuaded out of their delusions, perchance; but doubtless they may be persuaded to avoid perils.I think this dream of yours hath the seeming of honest truth to you, and therefore is not criminal—but do not tarry here with it; for here it is dangerous.”She looked steadily into Miles’s face a moment, then added, impressively, “It is the more dangerous for that you are much like what our lost lad must have grown to be if he had lived.”"
"“天啊，女士，可我就是他！”","“Heavens, madam, but I am he!”"
"“我真相信你所说的事，先生。这一点我不怀疑你的诚实。但是，我警告你，到此为止吧。我的丈夫在这一带是主人，他的权力几乎不会受到任何限制。只要他愿意，他可以叫人们发达，也可以叫人们饿死。如果你跟你所声称你是的人长得不像的话，我的丈夫可能不会打扰你，让你在你的梦里自娱自乐。可是，相信我，我很了解他，我知道他会做出什么：他会跟大家说你只是个冒名顶替的疯子，大家会直接跟着他说。”她又目不转睛地盯着迈尔斯，接着说：“如果你真的是迈尔斯·亨登，他知道，这个地区都知道，那你还是处于同样的危险之中，无疑还会遭受同样的惩罚。他会否认你，诋毁你，没有人会那么勇敢地支持你——想想我说的话，好好掂量一下。”","“I truly think you think it, sir.I question not your honesty in that; I but warn you, that is all.My husband is master in this region; his power hath hardly any limit; the people prosper or starve, as he wills.If you resembled not the man whom you profess to be, my husband might bid you pleasure yourself with your dream in peace; but trust me, I know him well; I know what he will do; he will say to all that you are but a mad impostor, and straightway all will echo him.”She bent upon Miles that same steady look once more, and added: “If you were Miles Hendon, and he knew it and all the region knew it—consider what I am saying, weigh it well—you would stand in the same peril, your punishment would be no less sure; he would deny you and denounce you, and none would be bold enough to give you countenance.”"
"“我十分相信，”迈尔斯痛苦地说，“能够使一生的朋友背叛和否认另一个人，而且使其言听计从的权力，确实会让这一带那些食物和生命没有保障、不关心忠诚和尊严的人低头。”","“Most truly I believe it,” said Miles, bitterly.“The power that can command one life-long friend to betray and disown another, and be obeyed, may well look to be obeyed in quarters where bread and life are on the stake and no cobweb ties of loyalty and honour are concerned.”"
"这时，女士的脸颊了微微泛红，低下眼睛低看着地板。但是，她继续说话时，声音没有任何异样：","A faint tinge appeared for a moment in the lady’s cheek, and she dropped her eyes to the floor; but her voice betrayed no emotion when she proceeded—"
"“我已经警告你了，而我必须再一次警告你，离开吧。否则，这个人会毁了你。他是一个不知道怜悯的暴君。我是他戴上枷锁的奴隶，我清楚这一点。可怜的迈尔斯、阿瑟，还有我亲爱的监护人理查德先生都已逃脱了他，安息了。你跟了他们去，也比在这个恶棍的魔爪里好。你冒充迈尔斯是对他的头衔和财产的威胁。你在他自己的房子里侮辱了他，如果你留下来，你就完蛋了。走，不要犹豫。如果你缺钱，拿着这个钱包，我求求你，贿赂仆人们让你走出去。啊，听从警告，可怜的人，找机会逃走吧。”","“I have warned you—I must still warn you—to go hence.This man will destroy you, else.He is a tyrant who knows no pity.I, who am his fettered slave, know this.Poor Miles, and Arthur, and my dear guardian, Sir Richard, are free of him, and at rest: better that you were with them than that you bide here in the clutches of this miscreant.Your pretensions are a menace to his title and possessions; you have assaulted him in his own house: you are ruined if you stay.Go—do not hesitate.If you lack money, take this purse, I beg of you, and bribe the servants to let you pass.Oh, be warned, poor soul, and escape while you may.”"
"迈尔斯打手势拒绝了钱包，起来站到她面前。","Miles declined the purse with a gesture, and rose up and stood before her."
"“请答应我一件事情，”他说，“让你的眼睛看着我的眼睛，这样，我可以看看它们是否毫无波澜。好了，现在回答我。我是不是迈尔斯·亨登？”","“Grant me one thing,” he said.“Let your eyes rest upon mine, so that I may see if they be steady.There—now answer me.Am I Miles Hendon?”"
"“不。我不认识你。”","“No.I know you not.”"
"“发誓！”","“Swear it!”"
"回答声音很低，但是很清楚：","The answer was low, but distinct—"
"“我发誓。”","“I swear.”"
"“啊，我相信了！”","“Oh, this passes belief!”"
"“快跑！你为什么要浪费宝贵的时间？快跑，救你自己。”","“Fly!Why will you waste the precious time?Fly, and save yourself.”"
"这时，警官闯进了房间，开始了一场恶斗。但亨登很快落败，被人拖走了。国王也给带走了，两个人都被绑着，关进了监狱。","At that moment the officers burst into the room, and a violent struggle began; but Hendon was soon overpowered and dragged away.The King was taken also, and both were bound and led to prison."

"单人牢房已经满了，所以这两个朋友被一起关在了通常关押轻犯的大牢里。他们有伴，因为里面有二十几个带着手铐脚镣的囚犯，男女老少都有，这是帮既可恶又吵闹的人。国王对他的皇帝身份遭受的奇耻大辱十分气愤，但是亨登不怎么高兴，沉默不语。他完全茫然不知所措。他回到了家，这个兴高采烈的浪子以为每个人都会为他的归来而高兴万分，可是，他却受到了冷遇，进了监狱。愿望和现实差距太大，结果令人震惊，他不知道这是最悲剧的还是最荒诞的事情。他觉得自己很像一个原本手舞足蹈地跑出去看彩虹，结果却遭闪电击中的人。","The cells were all crowded; so the two friends were chained in a large room where persons charged with trifling offences were commonly kept.They had company, for there were some twenty manacled and fettered prisoners here, of both sexes and of varying ages,—an obscene and noisy gang.The King chafed bitterly over the stupendous indignity thus put upon his royalty, but Hendon was moody and taciturn.He was pretty thoroughly bewildered; he had come home, a jubilant prodigal, expecting to find everybody wild with joy over his return; and instead had got the cold shoulder and a jail.The promise and the fulfilment differed so widely that the effect was stunning; he could not decide whether it was most tragic or most grotesque.He felt much as a man might who had danced blithely out to enjoy a rainbow, and got struck by lightning."
"但是，渐渐地，他那迷惑、困扰的想法理出了点头绪，于是他把思考的中心放在伊迪丝上。他翻来覆去地思考她的行为，从各个角度考量，可他没有从中得出任何满意的结论。她认识他吗，抑或她不认识他？这真是个令人困惑的谜，令他思考了许久。但最终，他坚信她确实认得他，只是因为有关利害的原因而否定了他。他现在想诅咒她的名字，可是这个名字长久以来对他来说是那么神圣，以至于他发现自己难以开口亵渎它。","But gradually his confused and tormenting thoughts settled down into some sort of order, and then his mind centred itself upon Edith.He turned her conduct over, and examined it in all lights, but he could not make anything satisfactory out of it.Did she know him—or didn’t she know him?It was a perplexing puzzle, and occupied him a long time; but he ended, finally, with the conviction that she did know him, and had repudiated him for interested reasons.He wanted to load her name with curses now; but this name had so long been sacred to him that he found he could not bring his tongue to profane it."
"亨登和国王裹着监狱的肮脏破旧的毛毯，度过了不安的一夜。狱卒受了贿赂，给一些囚犯酒喝，结果自然是：他们唱下流的歌、打架、喊叫、饮酒狂欢。后来，刚过半夜，一个男人用手铐打一个女人的头，差点把她打死，狱卒过来救了她。狱卒用棍子狠狠地打了这个男人的脑袋和肩膀，大家恢复了平静，停止了饮酒狂欢。之后，那些不介意两个受伤的人的呻吟和抱怨的人就有机会睡觉了。","Wrapped in prison blankets of a soiled and tattered condition, Hendon and the King passed a troubled night.For a bribe the jailer had furnished liquor to some of the prisoners; singing of ribald songs, fighting, shouting, and carousing was the natural consequence.At last, a while after midnight, a man attacked a woman and nearly killed her by beating her over the head with his manacles before the jailer could come to the rescue.The jailer restored peace by giving the man a sound clubbing about the head and shoulders—then the carousing ceased; and after that, all had an opportunity to sleep who did not mind the annoyance of the moanings and groanings of the two wounded people."
"接下来的一周，每个日夜都单调地重复着同样的事情：白天，有些人来探望“冒名顶替者”，否认他，侮辱他，而亨登基本上能清楚地记得他们的脸；夜晚，饮酒狂欢和争吵打架周而复始地重复。然而，终于有件偶然的事情改变了这些。狱卒带进来一个老人，对他说：","During the ensuing week, the days and nights were of a monotonous sameness as to events; men whose faces Hendon remembered more or less distinctly, came, by day, to gaze at the ‘impostor’ and repudiate and insult him; and by night the carousing and brawling went on with symmetrical regularity.However, there was a change of incident at last.The jailer brought in an old man, and said to him—"
"“这个恶棍在这间牢房里。睁大你那老眼，看看能不能找出他来。”","“The villain is in this room—cast thy old eyes about and see if thou canst say which is he.”"
"亨登抬头一看，入狱以来第一次感到高兴。他心想：“这是布莱克·安德鲁斯，他一辈子都在我父亲家里做仆人。他是一个诚实的好人，有一颗正直的心。那是以前了。可是现在没有人诚实，所有人都是骗子。这个人会认得我，但也会跟其他人一样否认我。”","Hendon glanced up, and experienced a pleasant sensation for the first time since he had been in the jail.He said to himself, “This is Blake Andrews, a servant all his life in my father’s family—a good honest soul, with a right heart in his breast.That is, formerly.But none are true now; all are liars.This man will know me—and will deny me, too, like the rest.”"
"老人仔细地环视了一周大牢，一一看过每个人的脸，最后说：","The old man gazed around the room, glanced at each face in turn, and finally said—"
"“我看这里都是些可恶的恶棍，街上的混混。哪个是他？”","“I see none here but paltry knaves, scum o’ the streets.Which is he?”"
"狱卒大笑。","The jailer laughed."
"“这，”他说，“看看这个大畜生，给我个看法。”","“Here,” he said; “scan this big animal, and grant me an opinion.”"
"老人走近，认真地看了亨登好一会儿，然后摇摇头，说：","The old man approached, and looked Hendon over, long and earnestly, then shook his head and said—"
"“啊，这不是亨登，绝对不是！”","“Marry, THIS is no Hendon—nor ever was!”"
"“对！你的老眼还很健康。如果我是休先生，我会将这衣衫褴褛的粗人——”","“Right!Thy old eyes are sound yet.An’ I were Sir Hugh, I would take the shabby carle and—”"
"狱卒停下来，做出用一根想象的绳子把他自己吊起来，脚尖刚刚触地的动作，同时喉咙里发出窒息的咕噜声。老人报复地说：","The jailer finished by lifting himself a-tip-toe with an imaginary halter, at the same time making a gurgling noise in his throat suggestive of suffocation.The old man said, vindictively—"
"“让他求上帝别比这个更糟了。而且——我——我会解决他将痛斥的这个恶棍，否则我就不算是个男人！”狱卒笑得像只高兴的鬣狗，说道：","“Let him bless God an’ he fare no worse.An’ – I – had the handling o’ the villain he should roast, or I am no true man!”The jailer laughed a pleasant hyena laugh, and said—"
"“告诉他你怎么想的，老伙计，他们都会照做。你会发现这是个不错的消遣。”","“Give him a piece of thy mind, old man—they all do it.Thou’lt find it good diversion.”"
"然后，他朝前厅里走了走，就消失了。老人双膝下跪，悄悄地说：","Then he sauntered toward his ante-room and disappeared.The old man dropped upon his knees and whispered—"
"“感谢上帝，你又回来了，我的主人！七年来，我以为你死了，看，你还活着！第一眼我就认出了您。要假装一副无情的表情，假装这里看到的都是卑鄙的恶棍和街上的垃圾，对我来说真是件困难的事。我又老又穷，迈尔斯先生。您说句话，我就去宣布真相，就算我因此被绞死也没关系。”","“God be thanked, thou’rt come again, my master!I believed thou wert dead these seven years, and lo, here thou art alive!I knew thee the moment I saw thee; and main hard work it was to keep a stony countenance and seem to see none here but tuppenny knaves and rubbish o’ the streets.I am old and poor, Sir Miles; but say the word and I will go forth and proclaim the truth though I be strangled for it.”"
"“不，”亨登说，“你不要去。这会害了你，却对我没有一点儿帮助。但是我感谢你，因为我快要对我的身份失去信心了，是你给了我点支持。”","“No,” said Hendon; “thou shalt not.It would ruin thee, and yet help but little in my cause.But I thank thee, for thou hast given me back somewhat of my lost faith in my kind.”"
"老仆人成了对亨登和国王来说非常有用的人，因为他一天会来“侮辱”亨登好几次，而且总偷偷地送来好吃的食物替换牢饭，也带来新的消息。亨登把可口饭菜留给国王，不然陛下可能早饿死了，因为他吃不下狱卒给的粗茶淡饭。安德鲁斯不得不缩短自己的探望时间，以免引起他人怀疑，不过每次他都尽量说很多信息。他低声地对亨登说话，其中还夹杂些大声的侮辱的词语，这是说给别人听的。","The old servant became very valuable to Hendon and the King; for he dropped in several times a day to ‘abuse’ the former, and always smuggled in a few delicacies to help out the prison bill of fare; he also furnished the current news.Hendon reserved the dainties for the King; without them his Majesty might not have survived, for he was not able to eat the coarse and wretched food provided by the jailer.Andrews was obliged to confine himself to brief visits, in order to avoid suspicion; but he managed to impart a fair degree of information each time—information delivered in a low voice, for Hendon’s benefit, and interlarded with insulting epithets delivered in a louder voice for the benefit of other hearers."
"就这样，他一点一点讲出了家里的故事。阿瑟已经死了六年了。阿瑟的死，加上亨登杳无音信，使父亲的身体每况愈下。他觉得自己就要死去，希望去世前能看到休和伊迪丝的生活安定下来。但是伊迪丝苦苦哀求拖延，希望等迈尔斯回来。接着，他们就收到了那封迈尔斯死亡的信。噩耗击垮了理查德先生，他相信自己将不久于人世，于是和休坚持要办完婚事。伊迪丝哀求，得到了一个月的暂缓，然后又拖了一个月。最后，在第三个月里，他们在理查德临终时举行了婚礼。这是桩不幸的婚姻。整个村庄对此都窃窃私预，因为婚礼举行不久，新娘从丈夫的信件中找到了几张那封死亡之信的未完成的草稿，指责他用一封邪恶的假信逼婚，也指责他逼死了理查德先生。伊迪丝女士和仆人被虐待的事情人尽皆知。自从父亲去世后，休先生撕掉了所有温柔的面具，变成了那些依靠他和他的财产吃饭的人的残酷主人。","So, little by little, the story of the family came out.Arthur had been dead six years.This loss, with the absence of news from Hendon, impaired the father’s health; he believed he was going to die, and he wished to see Hugh and Edith settled in life before he passed away; but Edith begged hard for delay, hoping for Miles’s return; then the letter came which brought the news of Miles’s death; the shock prostrated Sir Richard; he believed his end was very near, and he and Hugh insisted upon the marriage; Edith begged for and obtained a month’s respite, then another, and finally a third; the marriage then took place by the death-bed of Sir Richard.It had not proved a happy one.It was whispered about the country that shortly after the nuptials the bride found among her husband’s papers several rough and incomplete drafts of the fatal letter, and had accused him of precipitating the marriage—and Sir Richard’s death, too—by a wicked forgery.Tales of cruelty to the Lady Edith and the servants were to be heard on all hands; and since the father’s death Sir Hugh had thrown off all soft disguises and become a pitiless master toward all who in any way depended upon him and his domains for bread."
"国王十分有兴趣地听着安德鲁斯说的某些话：","There was a bit of Andrew’s gossip which the King listened to with a lively interest—"
"“有传言说国王疯了。但是你可千万别说是我说的，因为他们说，提这件事可是死罪。”","“There is rumour that the King is mad.But in charity forbear to say – I – mentioned it, for ’tis death to speak of it, they say.”"
"陛下注视着老人，说道：","His Majesty glared at the old man and said—"
"“国王没有疯，好心的人，别说些煽动人心的闲话。关心与你相干的事情吧，这才对你有好处。”","“The King is not mad, good man—and thou’lt find it to thy advantage to busy thyself with matters that nearer concern thee than this seditious prattle.”"
"“这个小伙子什么意思？”安德鲁斯说道。如此干脆而又出乎意料的攻击让他吃了一惊。","“What doth the lad mean?” said Andrews, surprised at this brisk assault from such an unexpected quarter."
"亨登叹口气，他没有回答他，而是接着自己的话说：","Hendon gave him a sign, and he did not pursue his question, but went on with his budget—"
"“驾崩的国王一两天内就要在温莎下葬，就在本月十六号，二十号会在威斯敏斯特举行新国王加冕典礼。”","“The late King is to be buried at Windsor in a day or two—the 16th of the month—and the new King will be crowned at Westminster the 20th.”"
"“我认为他们必须先找到他，”陛下咕哝道，接着又自信地说，“不过他们会处理好的，我也会的。”","“Methinks they must needs find him first,” muttered his Majesty; then added, confidently, “but they will look to that—and so also shall I.”"
"“看在——”","“In the name of—”"
"但是老人没说下去——亨登打了个手势，示意他住口。他接着回来继续他的闲话：","But the old man got no further—a warning sign from Hendon checked his remark.He resumed the thread of his gossip—"
"“休先生将参加加冕典礼，他抱有很大的希望。他很有信心被封为贵族，因为他深得摄政大臣的喜欢。”","“Sir Hugh goeth to the coronation—and with grand hopes.He confidently looketh to come back a peer, for he is high in favour with the Lord Protector.”"
"“什么摄政大臣？”陛下问。","“What Lord Protector?” asked his Majesty."
"“萨默塞特公爵大人。”","“His Grace the Duke of Somerset.”"
"“哪个萨默塞特公爵？”","“What Duke of Somerset?”"
"“天啊，只有一个——赫特福德伯爵西摩。”","“Marry, there is but one—Seymour, Earl of Hertford.”"
"国王急忙问：","The King asked sharply—"
"“他什么时候封为公爵，封为摄政大臣了？”","“Since when is he a duke, and Lord Protector?”"
"“一月的最后一天。”","“Since the last day of January.”"
"“请问谁封他的？”","“And prithee who made him so?”"
"“他自己和大国会，在国王的帮助下。”","“Himself and the Great Council—with help of the King.”"
"陛下开始暴跳如雷。“国王！”他喊道，","His Majesty started violently.“The King!” he cried."
"“哪个国王，好心的先生？”","“What king, good sir?”"
"“哪个国王，是啊！（天啊，这个男孩疯了吧？）我们一直只有一个国王，不难回答，就是最神圣的爱德华六世国王陛下。上帝保佑他！是，他还是个可爱、亲切的淘气鬼。不管他疯不疯——人们说他日益好转——所有人都对他交口称赞，所有人都祝福他，祈祷他能长久地统治英国，因为他一登基就人道地赦免了诺福克公爵的死刑，现在正忙于修改那些使老百姓受苦、受压迫的最残酷的法律。”","“What king, indeed!(God-a-mercy, what aileth the boy?)  Sith we have but one, ’tis not difficult to answer—his most sacred Majesty King Edward the Sixth—whom God preserve!Yea, and a dear and gracious little urchin is he, too; and whether he be mad or no—and they say he mendeth daily—his praises are on all men’s lips; and all bless him, likewise, and offer prayers that he may be spared to reign long in England; for he began humanely with saving the old Duke of Norfolk’s life, and now is he bent on destroying the cruellest of the laws that harry and oppress the people.”"
"听完这个新闻，陛下惊呆了，陷入了十分深沉、忧郁的思考中，听不到老人接下来说的闲话了。他想，这个“小淘气鬼”是不是那个穿上他的衣服、被他留在宫殿里的小乞丐。这似乎不可能，因为可以肯定，如果他假装是威尔士王子，他的行为和言语肯定会出卖他。然后他会被驱逐出来，人们便开始搜寻真正的王子。会不会是宫廷推举了某个贵族旁系来取代他的位置？不可能，因为他的舅舅不会允许这么做——他掌握着大权，当然能够，而且也会挫败这样的行动。男孩冥思苦想，却始终无果。他越想努力解开这个谜，就变得越困惑，他的头疼了起来，他的睡眠也变差了。每过一个小时，他急着回伦敦的愿望就越强烈，而且对他被囚禁的现状变得几乎无法忍受。","This news struck his Majesty dumb with amazement, and plunged him into so deep and dismal a reverie that he heard no more of the old man’s gossip.He wondered if the ‘little urchin’ was the beggar-boy whom he left dressed in his own garments in the palace.It did not seem possible that this could be, for surely his manners and speech would betray him if he pretended to be the Prince of Wales—then he would be driven out, and search made for the true prince.Could it be that the Court had set up some sprig of the nobility in his place?No, for his uncle would not allow that—he was all-powerful and could and would crush such a movement, of course.The boy’s musings profited him nothing; the more he tried to unriddle the mystery the more perplexed he became, the more his head ached, and the worse he slept.His impatience to get to London grew hourly, and his captivity became almost unendurable."
"亨登的所有办法对国王都失灵了，怎么都安慰不了他，但是锁在他旁边的两位妇女的安慰倒有些奏效。在她们温柔的帮助下，他平静下来，有了点耐心。他非常感激，非常爱她们，受到她们的体贴和安慰的作用，心情愉悦起来。他问她们为什么会坐牢，她们说她们是浸信会教友。这时他笑了，问道：","Hendon’s arts all failed with the King—he could not be comforted; but a couple of women who were chained near him succeeded better.Under their gentle ministrations he found peace and learned a degree of patience.He was very grateful, and came to love them dearly and to delight in the sweet and soothing influence of their presence.He asked them why they were in prison, and when they said they were Baptists, he smiled, and inquired—"
"“这是要被关进监狱的罪行吗？现在我很伤心，因为我就要失去你们，他们不会为这点小事关你们很久。”","“Is that a crime to be shut up for in a prison?Now I grieve, for I shall lose ye—they will not keep ye long for such a little thing.”"
"她们没有回答，而她们脸上的神情使他不安。他急忙说：","They did not answer; and something in their faces made him uneasy.He said, eagerly—"
"“你们不说话，可怜我，告诉我吧，没有其他惩罚了吧？请告诉我，不会再有别的惩罚了。”","“You do not speak; be good to me, and tell me—there will be no other punishment?Prithee tell me there is no fear of that.”"
"她们试图转移话题，但这已经引起了他的担心，他接着说：","They tried to change the topic, but his fears were aroused, and he pursued it—"
"“他们会鞭打你们吗？不，不，他们不会这么残忍！说他们不会。快点，他们不会的，是吧？”","“Will they scourge thee?No, no, they would not be so cruel!Say they would not.Come, they will not, will they?”"
"藏不住的困惑和阴郁显现在妇女脸上，可回答不可避免，因此，其中一个因激动而有些哽塞地说道：","The women betrayed confusion and distress, but there was no avoiding an answer, so one of them said, in a voice choked with emotion—"
"“哦，你让我们心碎了，你这温柔的灵魂！上帝会帮助我们承受我们的——”","“Oh, thou’lt break our hearts, thou gentle spirit!—God will help us to bear our—”"
"“这是承认！”国王插了进来。","“It is a confession!” the King broke in."
"“那么他们会鞭打你们，这群铁石心肠的混蛋！但是，哦，你们别哭，我无法忍受。请保持勇敢。我会及时回到自己的位置，将你们从痛苦中解救出来，我会这么做的！”","“Then they will scourge thee, the stony-hearted wretches!But oh, thou must not weep, I cannot bear it.Keep up thy courage—I shall come to my own in time to save thee from this bitter thing, and I will do it!”"
"早上国王醒来时，妇女已经不见了。","When the King awoke in the morning, the women were gone."
"“她们得救了！”他雀跃地说，但又沮丧地加了一句，“可怜的我！因为她们是安慰我的人。”","“They are saved!”he said, joyfully; then added, despondently, “but woe is me!—for they were my comforters.”"
"她们每人给他留下了一条丝带，系在他衣服上，以作纪念。他说他会永远保留这些纪念品，而且他很快就会找到这些亲爱的朋友，保护她们。","Each of them had left a shred of ribbon pinned to his clothing, in token of remembrance.He said he would keep these things always; and that soon he would seek out these dear good friends of his and take them under his protection."
"这时，狱卒带着几个手下进来了，下令将囚犯带到监狱院子里。国王欣喜若狂——又能见到蓝色的天空，呼吸到新鲜的空气，真是一件幸运的事。他对狱官的缓慢感到烦躁和恼怒，不过终于轮到他了。他被从锁环里放出来，和亨登一起按照命令随着其他囚犯走。","Just then the jailer came in with some subordinates, and commanded that the prisoners be conducted to the jail-yard.The King was overjoyed—it would be a blessed thing to see the blue sky and breathe the fresh air once more.He fretted and chafed at the slowness of the officers, but his turn came at last, and he was released from his staple and ordered to follow the other prisoners with Hendon."
"这个院子，或是说四方院子里铺着石头，是露天的。囚犯们经过一个巨大的石头拱门进入院子，排列成两队，背靠着墙站着。他们前面有一根拉紧的绳子，并且有狱官看守着他们。这是一个寒冷、阴暗的早上，昨晚下的一层薄薄的雪将大片空地覆盖成了白色，给整片阴暗增添了些许神色。时不时有些冷冷的风吹过这里，雪花就四处飘转起来。","The court or quadrangle was stone-paved, and open to the sky.The prisoners entered it through a massive archway of masonry, and were placed in file, standing, with their backs against the wall.A rope was stretched in front of them, and they were also guarded by their officers.It was a chill and lowering morning, and a light snow which had fallen during the night whitened the great empty space and added to the general dismalness of its aspect.Now and then a wintry wind shivered through the place and sent the snow eddying hither and thither."
"院子的中央站着两个女人，她们被绑在柱子上。国王一眼就认出这是他的两个好朋友。他不寒而栗，心想：“天啊，像我原来想的一样，她们没有被释放。想想，这样的人竟然要吃鞭子！在英国！唉，这真是英国的耻辱，在不管是信仰异教还是基督教的英国，都不允许！她们将被鞭打，而我，曾经得到她们的安慰和好心的施舍的我，必须袖手旁观，任凭错误的事情发生。这很奇怪，真奇怪，我是这片广阔的国土上的权力的来源，却无力保护她们。　不过，这些恶棍最好自己小心点，因为总有一天，我会和他们好好地算算这笔帐。因为他们现在每打一鞭子，将来就得挨一百鞭子。”","In the centre of the court stood two women, chained to posts.A glance showed the King that these were his good friends.He shuddered, and said to himself, “Alack, they are not gone free, as I had thought.To think that such as these should know the lash!—in England!Ay, there’s the shame of it—not in Heathennesse, Christian England!They will be scourged; and I, whom they have comforted and kindly entreated, must look on and see the great wrong done; it is strange, so strange, that I, the very source of power in this broad realm, am helpless to protect them.But let these miscreants look well to themselves, for there is a day coming when I will require of them a heavy reckoning for this work.For every blow they strike now, they shall feel a hundred then.”"
"一扇大门突然打开了，涌进来一群老百姓。他们一窝蜂地围住了这两个妇女，挡住了国王的视线。一位牧师走进来，穿过人群，他也被淹没了。现在国王听到了说话声，一来一去，好像是一问一答，但是他听不清说的内容。接着是一阵喧闹和准备工作，狱官们来来回回穿过妇女身边另一侧的人群。这时候，人群渐渐安静下来。","A great gate swung open, and a crowd of citizens poured in.They flocked around the two women, and hid them from the King’s view.A clergyman entered and passed through the crowd, and he also was hidden.The King now heard talking, back and forth, as if questions were being asked and answered, but he could not make out what was said.Next there was a deal of bustle and preparation, and much passing and repassing of officials through that part of the crowd that stood on the further side of the women; and whilst this proceeded a deep hush gradually fell upon the people."
"现在，人群听从命令分到两边，国王看到了那令他毛骨悚然的一幕。两个妇女的旁边堆了柴火，一个人正跪着点燃这些柴火！","Now, by command, the masses parted and fell aside, and the King saw a spectacle that froze the marrow in his bones.Faggots had been piled about the two women, and a kneeling man was lighting them!"
"妇女低着头，双手捂住脸，黄色的火焰开始从噼里啪啦的柴火里往上爬，环状的青烟随风飘散开来。牧师抬起手，开始做祈祷。正在这时，两个年轻的女孩飞奔进大门，一边尖叫着，直往柱子上的妇女这边扑来。她们立刻就被狱官拽开，其中一个被紧紧抓住，但是另一个挣脱了，说她要和母亲一起死。狱官拦不住她，她又抱住了母亲的脖子。她再一次被拉开，外衣都烧着了。两三个人抱住她，外衣烧着的部分给扯了下来，扔到一边烧。她一直在挣扎着想要逃脱，她说现在世界上也许会只剩她一个人了，所以祈求能和她的母亲一起死。两个女孩一直在尖叫，想挣脱，但是这种吵闹突然被因致命疼痛而不约而同地发出的撕心裂肺的尖叫声所淹没。国王的视线从疯狂的女孩那儿转移到了柱子上，然后转过身来，死灰般的脸贴在墙上，再也不去看了。他说：“我在刚才在那短暂的一瞬间中所看到的情景将永远无法从我的记忆中抹去，它将永远停留在那里。我每个白天都会看到它，每个夜里都会梦到它，直到我死去。上帝，但愿我的眼睛瞎了！”","The women bowed their heads, and covered their faces with their hands; the yellow flames began to climb upward among the snapping and crackling faggots, and wreaths of blue smoke to stream away on the wind; the clergyman lifted his hands and began a prayer—just then two young girls came flying through the great gate, uttering piercing screams, and threw themselves upon the women at the stake.Instantly they were torn away by the officers, and one of them was kept in a tight grip, but the other broke loose, saying she would die with her mother; and before she could be stopped she had flung her arms about her mother’s neck again.She was torn away once more, and with her gown on fire.Two or three men held her, and the burning portion of her gown was snatched off and thrown flaming aside, she struggling all the while to free herself, and saying she would be alone in the world, now; and begging to be allowed to die with her mother.Both the girls screamed continually, and fought for freedom; but suddenly this tumult was drowned under a volley of heart-piercing shrieks of mortal agony—the King glanced from the frantic girls to the stake, then turned away and leaned his ashen face against the wall, and looked no more.He said, “That which I have seen, in that one little moment, will never go out from my memory, but will abide there; and I shall see it all the days, and dream of it all the nights, till I die.Would God I had been blind!”"
"亨登看着国王。他很满意地想：“他的精神病好些了。他变了，变得更加温柔了。如果像往常一样，他早就朝这些恶棍发火了，并说他是国王，并命令他们毫发无伤地放了这两个妇女。很快，他的幻想就会消失，被忘记，他那可怜的脑瓜又会健全了。上帝保佑那一天赶紧到来吧！”","Hendon was watching the King.He said to himself, with satisfaction, “His disorder mendeth; he hath changed, and groweth gentler.If he had followed his wont, he would have stormed at these varlets, and said he was King, and commanded that the women be turned loose unscathed.Soon his delusion will pass away and be forgotten, and his poor mind will be whole again.God speed the day!”"
"那天，有好几个囚犯被带过来过夜，看守正在将他们押运到王国的各地，去接受对所犯罪行的惩罚。国王与这些人谈话。他从一开始就特别重视这件事情。为了在王室工作上得到些启示，他一有机会就向这些囚犯问问题。他们的故事很悲伤，让他心如刀绞。其中有一个可怜的半疯女人，她从织工那里偷了一两码布，因此被判绞刑。另外一个人被告偷了一匹马。他说证据并不确凿，本以为可以免去绞刑，但是没有。他差点就被释放了，但是又被控告杀死了国王庄园里的一只鹿，罪名成立，他很快就要上绞架。还有有一个商人的学徒，他的案子尤其让国王难过。这个年轻人说，一天傍晚，他发现了一只从主人家逃走的鹰，以为可以据为己有，于是就把它带回了家。但是法庭判决他偷了鹰，判他死刑。","That same day several prisoners were brought in to remain over night, who were being conveyed, under guard, to various places in the kingdom, to undergo punishment for crimes committed.The King conversed with these—he had made it a point, from the beginning, to instruct himself for the kingly office by questioning prisoners whenever the opportunity offered—and the tale of their woes wrung his heart.One of them was a poor half-witted woman who had stolen a yard or two of cloth from a weaver—she was to be hanged for it.Another was a man who had been accused of stealing a horse; he said the proof had failed, and he had imagined that he was safe from the halter; but no—he was hardly free before he was arraigned for killing a deer in the King’s park; this was proved against him, and now he was on his way to the gallows.There was a tradesman’s apprentice whose case particularly distressed the King; this youth said he found a hawk, one evening, that had escaped from its owner, and he took it home with him, imagining himself entitled to it; but the court convicted him of stealing it, and sentenced him to death."
"听了这些不人道的事情，国王怒不可遏，想让亨登同他一起越狱，赶往威斯敏斯特，这样他便可以登上他的宝座，挥舞他的权杖，施恩于这些不幸的人们，挽救他们的生命。“可怜的孩子，”亨登叹气道，“这些悲伤的故事又让他犯病了。天啊，如果不是因为这些不幸的遭遇，他肯定很快就痊愈了。”","The King was furious over these inhumanities, and wanted Hendon to break jail and fly with him to Westminster, so that he could mount his throne and hold out his sceptre in mercy over these unfortunate people and save their lives.“Poor child,” sighed Hendon, “these woeful tales have brought his malady upon him again; alack, but for this evil hap, he would have been well in a little time.”"
"囚犯中有一位年长的律师，这是个面容强势、神情无畏的男人。过去三年里，他写了一本反对英国上议院大法官的小册子，控告他执法不公。因此，他在枷刑中失去了双耳，在监狱中受尽折磨，另外，还被罚款三千磅，并处以终身监禁。","Among these prisoners was an old lawyer—a man with a strong face and a dauntless mien.Three years past, he had written a pamphlet against the Lord Chancellor, accusing him of injustice, and had been punished for it by the loss of his ears in the pillory, and degradation from the bar, and in addition had been fined 3,000 pounds and sentenced to imprisonment for life."
"最近，他又在重复自己的罪行，结果他现在被判割掉耳朵剩下的部分，罚款五千磅，双颊烙上印记，仍旧是无期徒刑。“这些是令人尊敬的伤疤。”他一边说，一边将花白的头发理到后面去，露出残缺不全的耳根——那曾经是他的耳朵。","Lately he had repeated his offence; and in consequence was now under sentence to lose WHAT REMAINED OF HIS EARS, pay a fine of 5,000 pounds, be branded on both cheeks, and remain in prison for life.“These be honourable scars,” he said, and turned back his grey hair and showed the mutilated stubs of what had once been his ears."
"国王的眼睛里燃烧着激情。他说：","The King’s eye burned with passion.He said—"
"“没人相信我，你们也不会相信我。不过没关系。一个月之内，你们将被释放，而且，让你们蒙羞，也让英国蒙羞的法律将从法典中废除。这个世界有问题，而国王应该时常去学校学习自己的法律，从而学会仁慈。”","“None believe in me—neither wilt thou.But no matter—within the compass of a month thou shalt be free; and more, the laws that have dishonoured thee, and shamed the English name, shall be swept from the statute books.The world is made wrong; kings should go to school to their own laws, at times, and so learn mercy.”"
"第二十八章 牺牲","Chapter XXVIII   The Sacrifice"
"同时，迈尔斯越来越受够了囚禁和无法行动。但是，现在他的判决来了，他很高兴，觉得自己乐意接受任何不需再被囚禁的刑罚。但在这一点上，他错了。当他发现自己被描述成一个冒犯亨登庄园主人的“顽固的流氓”，并为此被判戴足枷两个小时的时候，他勃然大怒。他自称与原告是兄弟，对亨登的荣誉和财产享有合理的继承权，却遭到了轻蔑的无视，好像他说的话根本不值得验证。","Meantime Miles was growing sufficiently tired of confinement and inaction.But now his trial came on, to his great gratification, and he thought he could welcome any sentence provided a further imprisonment should not be a part of it.But he was mistaken about that.He was in a fine fury when he found himself described as a ‘sturdy vagabond’ and sentenced to sit two hours in the stocks for bearing that character and for assaulting the master of Hendon Hall.His pretensions as to brothership with his prosecutor, and rightful heirship to the Hendon honours and estates, were left contemptuously unnoticed, as being not even worth examination."
"去接受刑罚的路上，他又是发怒，又是威胁，但都没用。狱官们非常粗鲁地抓着他，而且有时会因为他无礼的行为揍他几拳。","He raged and threatened on his way to punishment, but it did no good; he was snatched roughly along by the officers, and got an occasional cuff, besides, for his irreverent conduct."
"国王无法穿过后面一窝蜂似的乌合之众，因此只能跟在后面，与他的好朋友兼仆人离得好远。国王本人也几乎因为有这样糟糕的同伴而被判足枷刑，但是考虑到国王年纪还小，只是教育和警告了他之后就释放了。人群终于停下后，他沿着人群的外围疯狂乱转，想寻找空当钻进去。经过许多努力和等待，他终于成功了。可怜的随从坐在丢人的足枷上，成了卑鄙的乌合之众的娱乐和笑柄——他可是英国国王的贴身侍卫啊！爱德华听到了判决，但是他一点儿都没意识到这意味着什么。当他真正了解新的侮辱是什么，他的怒火开始燃烧。接下来，他看到一个鸡蛋从空中飞过去，砸在亨登的脸上，碎了，然后听到众人因这个插曲而欢呼的时候，他的怒火一下子烧到了炎炎夏日的温度。他冲过开口的圆圈，与主管的狱官面对面，大叫道：","The King could not pierce through the rabble that swarmed behind; so he was obliged to follow in the rear, remote from his good friend and servant.The King had been nearly condemned to the stocks himself for being in such bad company, but had been let off with a lecture and a warning, in consideration of his youth.When the crowd at last halted, he flitted feverishly from point to point around its outer rim, hunting a place to get through; and at last, after a deal of difficulty and delay, succeeded.There sat his poor henchman in the degrading stocks, the sport and butt of a dirty mob—he, the body servant of the King of England!Edward had heard the sentence pronounced, but he had not realised the half that it meant.His anger began to rise as the sense of this new indignity which had been put upon him sank home; it jumped to summer heat, the next moment, when he saw an egg sail through the air and crush itself against Hendon’s cheek, and heard the crowd roar its enjoyment of the episode.He sprang across the open circle and confronted the officer in charge, crying—"
"“耻辱！这是我的仆人——放了他！我是——”","“For shame!This is my servant—set him free!I am the—”"
"“哦，住嘴！”亨登惊慌地大声说，“你会毁了自己的。别管他，长官，他疯了。”","“Oh, peace!” exclaimed Hendon, in a panic, “thou’lt destroy thyself.Mind him not, officer, he is mad.”"
"“不用费心提他，好心人，我都没心思理他，但我倒是非常愿意教导他些什么的。”他回过头对一个手下说：“让这个小傻瓜尝一两下鞭子，收敛收敛他的行为。”","“Give thyself no trouble as to the matter of minding him, good man, I have small mind to mind him; but as to teaching him somewhat, to that I am well inclined.”He turned to a subordinate and said, “Give the little fool a taste or two of the lash, to mend his manners.”"
"“最好打他五六鞭子。”休先生建议说。他刚刚骑马过来，瞧一瞧事情进行得怎么样。","“Half a dozen will better serve his turn,” suggested Sir Hugh, who had ridden up, a moment before, to take a passing glance at the proceedings."
"国王被抓了起来。他甚至没有挣扎，只是想到像他这样神圣的人竟会遭受如此的暴行，他惊呆了。历史已经因一位英国国王遭到鞭打的记录被玷污了，而他肯定会再添加这样耻辱的一页。想到这儿，他就觉得无法忍受。他落入了圈套，得不到帮助。他要么接受惩罚，要么就得求饶。这是两难的情形。他愿意接受鞭打——一个国王可以接受鞭打，但是一个国王不能乞求。","The King was seized.He did not even struggle, so paralysed was he with the mere thought of the monstrous outrage that was proposed to be inflicted upon his sacred person.History was already defiled with the record of the scourging of an English king with whips—it was an intolerable reflection that he must furnish a duplicate of that shameful page.He was in the toils, there was no help for him; he must either take this punishment or beg for its remission.Hard conditions; he would take the stripes—a king might do that, but a king could not beg."
"不过同时，迈尔斯·亨登正在解决这个难题。“放了这个孩子，”他说，“你们这些无情的狗，你们没看到他有多小，多虚弱吗？放了他——我会替他挨鞭子。”","But meantime, Miles Hendon was resolving the difficulty.“Let the child go,” said he; “ye heartless dogs, do ye not see how young and frail he is?Let him go—I will take his lashes.”"
"“啊，好主意，谢谢。”休说道，脸上闪现出嘲笑的得意，“放了小乞丐，让这个人替他挨十二鞭子，要是实打实的十二鞭子，狠狠地打。”国王强烈地反对，但是休的话很有威慑力，让他住了口。休说：“对，说吧，就这样，放开你的胆子——不过，你要知道，你每说一个字，他就得多挨六鞭子。”","“Marry, a good thought—and thanks for it,” said Sir Hugh, his face lighting with a sardonic satisfaction.“Let the little beggar go, and give this fellow a dozen in his place—an honest dozen, well laid on.”The King was in the act of entering a fierce protest, but Sir Hugh silenced him with the potent remark, “Yes, speak up, do, and free thy mind—only, mark ye, that for each word you utter he shall get six strokes the more.”"
"亨登的足枷被打开了，他的背赤裸着。鞭子打下去的时候，可怜的小国王将脸扭到一边，与君王身份不相称的眼泪止不住地顺着脸颊流下来。“啊，勇敢的好心人，”他心想，“这样忠诚的事迹，我将永生不忘。我不会忘记它——而且他们也不会！”他激动地补充道。沉默中，他对亨登的高尚行为越来越感到敬佩，越来越对此感激。一会儿，他想：“是谁搭救王子，使他免于伤害和可能的死亡——是他为我做的，而且做得很好。但是，这是小事情，不足称道——啊，当这件事与使王子免于羞辱的行为相比较时，简直不值一提！”","Hendon was removed from the stocks, and his back laid bare; and whilst the lash was applied the poor little King turned away his face and allowed unroyal tears to channel his cheeks unchecked.“Ah, brave good heart,” he said to himself, “this loyal deed shall never perish out of my memory.I will not forget it—and neither shall they!” he added, with passion.Whilst he mused, his appreciation of Hendon’s magnanimous conduct grew to greater and still greater dimensions in his mind, and so also did his gratefulness for it.Presently he said to himself, “Who saves his prince from wounds and possible death—and this he did for me—performs high service; but it is little—it is nothing—oh, less than nothing! —when ’tis weighed against the act of him who saves his prince from shame!”"
"鞭子抽打下去，亨登没有喊叫，而是以士兵的坚韧承受着重重的鞭打。他的坚韧，连同他代替这男孩挨鞭打的事情，甚至让聚在那里的冷漠和卑鄙的人群油然生起敬意。嘲笑和蔑视的喊叫消失了，一片肃静，只剩下鞭子落下的声音。当亨登发现自己又戴上足枷上时，这里一片肃静，与刚刚那一片喧闹的侮辱声形成强烈的对比。国王轻轻地走到亨登旁边，在他耳边低声说：","Hendon made no outcry under the scourge, but bore the heavy blows with soldierly fortitude.This, together with his redeeming the boy by taking his stripes for him, compelled the respect of even that forlorn and degraded mob that was gathered there; and its gibes and hootings died away, and no sound remained but the sound of the falling blows.The stillness that pervaded the place, when Hendon found himself once more in the stocks, was in strong contrast with the insulting clamour which had prevailed there so little a while before.The King came softly to Hendon’s side, and whispered in his ear—"
"“国王不能够赐予你荣誉，好心人，伟大的灵魂，因为比国王伟大的上帝已经赐予你荣誉。但是，国王可以向人们彰显你的高尚。”他从地上捡起鞭子，轻轻地放在亨登流血的肩膀上，轻声说，“英国国王爱德华封您为伯爵！”","“Kings cannot ennoble thee, thou good, great soul, for One who is higher than kings hath done that for thee; but a king can confirm thy nobility to men.”He picked up the scourge from the ground, touched Hendon’s bleeding shoulders lightly with it, and whispered, “Edward of England dubs thee Earl!”"
"亨登十分感动。他眼睛里涌满了泪水，但此情此景让人害怕，又让人觉得幽默，完全瓦解了他的严肃，他只能努力不让内心的欢乐表露出来。光着膀子，浑身血迹的他突然被从一般的足枷提升到阿尔卑斯山高地和伯爵的荣耀，这在他看来是最荒诞不经的事情了。他心想：“现在我被镀了金银，真的！梦幻和影子王国里的幽灵骑士变成了幽灵伯爵，这是稚嫩翅膀的一次眩晕的飞翔！再这么下去，我不久将像五月柱一样，带着极大的荣耀和虚幻的荣誉被绞死。尽管那都是些华而不实的东西，但是我将珍惜它们，因为它们代表着爱。我这些可怜的虚拟的荣誉，不是乞求来的，是由干净的手和正直的心灵所赐予的，比那些卑躬屈膝地从不情不愿、怀有私心的权势那里买来的真正的荣誉更好。","Hendon was touched.The water welled to his eyes, yet at the same time the grisly humour of the situation and circumstances so undermined his gravity that it was all he could do to keep some sign of his inward mirth from showing outside.To be suddenly hoisted, naked and gory, from the common stocks to the Alpine altitude and splendour of an Earldom, seemed to him the last possibility in the line of the grotesque.He said to himself, “Now am I finely tinselled, indeed!The spectre-knight of the Kingdom of Dreams and Shadows is become a spectre-earl—a dizzy flight for a callow wing!An’ this go on, I shall presently be hung like a very maypole with fantastic gauds and make-believe honours.But I shall value them, all valueless as they are, for the love that doth bestow them.Better these poor mock dignities of mine, that come unasked, from a clean hand and a right spirit, than real ones bought by servility from grudging and interested power.”"
"令人畏惧的休先生调转马头。他扬鞭起步的时候，人墙默默地分成两路，让他通过，又同样默默地合拢在一起。人们就保持着这样。没有人敢替囚犯说句好话，或说句表示敬意的话。不过没关系，停止辱骂本身就是足够的敬意了。一个刚来的人不了解现在的情形，对“冒名顶替者”发出了嘲笑声，然后还猛烈地攻击，人们二话不说立即将他打倒，把他踢了出去，接着人群又恢复了寂静。","The dreaded Sir Hugh wheeled his horse about, and as he spurred away, the living wall divided silently to let him pass, and as silently closed together again.And so remained; nobody went so far as to venture a remark in favour of the prisoner, or in compliment to him; but no matter—the absence of abuse was a sufficient homage in itself.A late comer who was not posted as to the present circumstances, and who delivered a sneer at the ‘impostor,’ and was in the act of following it with a dead cat, was promptly knocked down and kicked out, without any words, and then the deep quiet resumed sway once more."
"第二十九章 前往伦敦","Chapter XXIX  To London"
"亨登的足枷刑结束后，他被释放了，并被下令离开这个地方，不得再回来。他的剑，还有他的骡子和毛驴都还给了他。他骑上走了，身后跟着国王。人群带着默默的敬意，让开路给他们通过，他们走后，人群就散了。","When Hendon’s term of service in the stocks was finished, he was released and ordered to quit the region and come back no more.His sword was restored to him, and also his mule and his donkey.He mounted and rode off, followed by the King, the crowd opening with quiet respectfulness to let them pass, and then dispersing when they were gone."
"亨登很快陷入了沉思。有一些重要的事情需要回答。他应该怎么办？他应该到哪里去？他必须从某处找到强有力的帮助，否则他必须得放弃他的遗产，还得背着冒名顶替者的罪名。哪里才有希望找到这种强有力的帮助呢？哪里呢，真是的！这真是个棘手的问题。渐渐地，他想到了一种可能性。当然，这是渺茫得不能再渺茫的可能性，可是还是值得考虑，因为除此之外没有其他任何可行的办法。他记起来，老安德鲁斯曾说过有关年轻的国王的仁慈，还有他对被冤枉的人和不幸之人宽容的保护。为什么不试着和他谈谈、祈求正义呢？啊，是的，但是这么一个爱幻想的贫儿能获准面见威严的君主吗？没关系，就顺其自然吧，船到桥头自然直。他是个老军人，习惯了设计手段和应急办法，他肯定能够找到路子。是的，他要朝着首都出发。也许父亲的老朋友汉弗莱·马洛先生可以帮助他。这位好心的老汉弗莱先生是已去世的国王的厨房、或者马棚、或者什么的长官——迈尔斯记不清到底是什么或是哪一个了。既然他有了消耗精力的事情，有了清晰的亟待达成的目标，原先笼罩着他的精神的羞辱和抑郁的雾升起散去了，于是他抬起头，看了看周围。他很惊讶地发现自己已经走了这么远，村子已被他远远地抛在了身后。国王低着头，慢悠悠地跟在他后面，因为他也在思索着计划对策。一片悲伤疑虑的云团遮盖了刚才的兴奋：在这个男孩短短的生命里，城市给他的只有虐待和贫困，那么他还愿意再去那里吗？但是必须问一下他，这是不可避免的。于是，亨登勒住缰绳停下来，大声说：","Hendon was soon absorbed in thought.There were questions of high import to be answered.What should he do?Whither should he go?Powerful help must be found somewhere, or he must relinquish his inheritance and remain under the imputation of being an impostor besides.Where could he hope to find this powerful help?Where, indeed!It was a knotty question.By-and-by a thought occurred to him which pointed to a possibility—the slenderest of slender possibilities, certainly, but still worth considering, for lack of any other that promised anything at all.He remembered what old Andrews had said about the young King’s goodness and his generous championship of the wronged and unfortunate.Why not go and try to get speech of him and beg for justice?Ah, yes, but could so fantastic a pauper get admission to the august presence of a monarch?Never mind—let that matter take care of itself; it was a bridge that would not need to be crossed till he should come to it.He was an old campaigner, and used to inventing shifts and expedients: no doubt he would be able to find a way.Yes, he would strike for the capital.Maybe his father’s old friend Sir Humphrey Marlow would help him—’good old Sir Humphrey, Head Lieutenant of the late King’s kitchen, or stables, or something’—Miles could not remember just what or which.Now that he had something to turn his energies to, a distinctly defined object to accomplish, the fog of humiliation and depression which had settled down upon his spirits lifted and blew away, and he raised his head and looked about him.He was surprised to see how far he had come; the village was away behind him.The King was jogging along in his wake, with his head bowed; for he, too, was deep in plans and thinkings.A sorrowful misgiving clouded Hendon’s new-born cheerfulness: would the boy be willing to go again to a city where, during all his brief life, he had never known anything but ill-usage and pinching want?But the question must be asked; it could not be avoided; so Hendon reined up, and called out—"
"“我忘了问，我们去哪里。听从您的命令，我的君主！”","“I had forgotten to inquire whither we are bound.Thy commands, my liege!”"
"“去往伦敦！”","“To London!”"
"亨登又接着往前走——他对这个回答非常满意，却也很是惊讶。","Hendon moved on again, mightily contented with the answer—but astounded at it too."
"整个旅途中没有发生什么惊险的大事。但最后却发生了一件事。二月十九日晚上十点左右，他们踏上了伦敦桥，陷入了翻滚挣扎的拥挤人群中。人们大叫着、欢呼着，人们的脸因喝了啤酒而变得兴高采烈，映着许多火炬的光，显得格外引人注目。就在这时，某个前公爵或者贵族的腐朽的头像摔落在人群中，打在了亨登的肘上，然后在混乱而匆忙的脚步中跳跃着消失了。人们在这个世界上的劳动成果是如此地容易消散和消逝！上任国王不过才去世三周，入葬才三天，他那辛辛苦苦地从知名人士那里为他高贵的桥挑选的装饰品就已经开始摔落了。一个市民被那颗头绊倒了，然后自己的头又撞到了前面的人的背上，于是这人转身打倒了身边紧挨着的一个人，然后自己又立刻被那个人的朋友给打倒了。此刻，混战的时机成熟了，因为明天的欢庆——加冕典礼——已经拉开了帷幕。每个人都酩酊大醉，且充满了爱国思想。五分钟后，这场混战占据了很大的场地；十或十二分钟后，它扩展到了差不多一英亩地，演变成了骚乱。这个时候，亨登和国王彻底走散了，迷失在了呼喊的人们的涌动和骚乱中。我们暂且不说他们。","The whole journey was made without an adventure of importance.But it ended with one.About ten o’clock on the night of the 19th of February they stepped upon London Bridge, in the midst of a writhing, struggling jam of howling and hurrahing people, whose beer-jolly faces stood out strongly in the glare from manifold torches—and at that instant the decaying head of some former duke or other grandee tumbled down between them, striking Hendon on the elbow and then bounding off among the hurrying confusion of feet.So evanescent and unstable are men’s works in this world! —the late good King is but three weeks dead and three days in his grave, and already the adornments which he took such pains to select from prominent people for his noble bridge are falling.A citizen stumbled over that head, and drove his own head into the back of somebody in front of him, who turned and knocked down the first person that came handy, and was promptly laid out himself by that person’s friend.It was the right ripe time for a free fight, for the festivities of the morrow—Coronation Day—were already beginning; everybody was full of strong drink and patriotism; within five minutes the free fight was occupying a good deal of ground; within ten or twelve it covered an acre of so, and was become a riot.By this time Hendon and the King were hopelessly separated from each other and lost in the rush and turmoil of the roaring masses of humanity.And so we leave them."
"第三十章 汤姆的进步","Chapter XXX  Tom’s Progress"
"当真正的国王在国土上到处游荡，破衣烂衫，粗茶淡饭，一会儿戴着手铐被流浪汉嘲笑，一会儿又与小偷和杀人犯关在一起，所有人无一例外地都叫他傻瓜和冒名者时，假国王汤姆·坎蒂却在享受着一种十分不同的经历。","Whilst the true King wandered about the land poorly clad, poorly fed, cuffed and derided by tramps one while, herding with thieves and murderers in a jail another, and called idiot and impostor by all impartially, the mock King Tom Canty enjoyed quite a different experience."
"我们上次说到他的时候，皇室地位在他看来才刚刚有了光明的一面。这光明的一面一日日越发地光鲜亮丽，在很短的时间里，它变得几乎全是阳光和愉悦。他不再害怕。他的担忧褪去，消逝，尴尬也不见了，他变得风度翩翩，从容自信。他也越来越懂得利用鞭童了。","When we saw him last, royalty was just beginning to have a bright side for him.This bright side went on brightening more and more every day: in a very little while it was become almost all sunshine and delightfulness.He lost his fears; his misgivings faded out and died; his embarrassments departed, and gave place to an easy and confident bearing.He worked the whipping-boy mine to ever-increasing profit."
"他想玩或是想说话时，就召来他的伊丽莎白公主和简·格雷郡主，结束后就让她们退去，他的样子就像是一个熟悉了这些事情的人。他也不再为这些高贵的人们在离开时亲吻他的手而烦恼。","He ordered my Lady Elizabeth and my Lady Jane Grey into his presence when he wanted to play or talk, and dismissed them when he was done with them, with the air of one familiarly accustomed to such performances.It no longer confused him to have these lofty personages kiss his hand at parting."
"他开始喜欢晚上被正式地带去睡觉，喜欢早上复杂而庄严的穿衣仪式。在他看来，出席有许多光鲜亮丽的国家官员和武士参加的晚宴开始成了令他自豪的乐事。实际上，他还将侍卫的数量翻了一番，增加到了一百人。他喜欢听军号在长廊中响起，还有随后远远传来的声音：“为国王让路！”","He came to enjoy being conducted to bed in state at night, and dressed with intricate and solemn ceremony in the morning.It came to be a proud pleasure to march to dinner attended by a glittering procession of officers of state and gentlemen-at-arms; insomuch, indeed, that he doubled his guard of gentlemen-at-arms, and made them a hundred.He liked to hear the bugles sounding down the long corridors, and the distant voices responding, “Way for the King!”"
"他甚至学会享受坐在国会的王位上，看起来似乎不仅仅是摄政大臣的传声筒。他喜欢接见重要的大使，看到他们华丽的长袍，听他们从称他为兄弟的杰出君王那里带来的亲切问候。啊，高兴的汤姆·坎蒂，他前不久还在垃圾大院里！","He even learned to enjoy sitting in throned state in council, and seeming to be something more than the Lord Protector’s mouthpiece.He liked to receive great ambassadors and their gorgeous trains, and listen to the affectionate messages they brought from illustrious monarchs who called him brother.O happy Tom Canty, late of Offal Court!"
"他喜爱他华丽的衣服，并定制了更多。他觉得四百名仆人对于他这样高贵的人来说太少了，便把他们增加为原来的三倍。问安的朝臣们的奉承成了他悦耳的音乐。他依旧善良温和，是所有受压迫的人们坚决拥护的人。他孜孜不倦地向不公正的法律挑战，不过有时被触怒的时候，他会迁怒于一个伯爵，甚至是是一个公爵，然后给他以眼色，让他战栗。　有一次，严肃可怕的皇姐玛丽公主与他理论，认为他赦免那么多本该坐牢、绞死，或是烧死的人不是明智的行为，并提醒他，在他们过世的威严的父亲的监狱里，最多曾同时囚禁六万名罪犯，而且在他令人敬佩的统治下，他将七万两千名小偷和强盗送到刽子手那里接受死刑。这时，男孩义愤填膺，命令她回到自己的闺阁去，并请求上帝将她胸中的石头取走，给她一颗人类的心。","He enjoyed his splendid clothes, and ordered more: he found his four hundred servants too few for his proper grandeur, and trebled them.The adulation of salaaming courtiers came to be sweet music to his ears.He remained kind and gentle, and a sturdy and determined champion of all that were oppressed, and he made tireless war upon unjust laws: yet upon occasion, being offended, he could turn upon an earl, or even a duke, and give him a look that would make him tremble.Once, when his royal ‘sister,’ the grimly holy Lady Mary, set herself to reason with him against the wisdom of his course in pardoning so many people who would otherwise be jailed, or hanged, or burned, and reminded him that their august late father’s prisons had sometimes contained as high as sixty thousand convicts at one time, and that during his admirable reign he had delivered seventy-two thousand thieves and robbers over to death by the executioner, the boy was filled with generous indignation, and commanded her to go to her closet, and beseech God to take away the stone that was in her breast, and give her a human heart."
"对于可怜的真正的小王子，那个善良地对待他，热心地飞奔出去找皇宫门口那个傲慢的哨兵为他报仇的王子，汤姆·坎蒂就从来没有感到过不安吗？他有过。刚开始在皇宫的那些日夜里，王子走失的痛苦思虑纠缠着他，他热切盼望王子归来，盼望他高高兴兴地恢复与生俱来的权力和显赫的地位。但是，随着时间流逝，王子没有回来，汤姆的脑子越来越被新鲜和迷人的经历所占据。渐渐地，走失的君王几乎淡出了他的思虑。最后，当他偶尔真的闯入汤姆的思绪中时，他成了不受欢迎的小鬼，因为他使汤姆感到内疚和惭愧。","Did Tom Canty never feel troubled about the poor little rightful prince who had treated him so kindly, and flown out with such hot zeal to avenge him upon the insolent sentinel at the palace-gate?Yes; his first royal days and nights were pretty well sprinkled with painful thoughts about the lost prince, and with sincere longings for his return, and happy restoration to his native rights and splendours.But as time wore on, and the prince did not come, Tom’s mind became more and more occupied with his new and enchanting experiences, and by little and little the vanished monarch faded almost out of his thoughts; and finally, when he did intrude upon them at intervals, he was become an unwelcome spectre, for he made Tom feel guilty and ashamed."
"汤姆可怜的母亲和姐姐们也同样淡出了他的思绪。刚开始，他还想念她们，并为之感到悲伤，渴望见到她们。但是后来，想到哪天她们会穿着又脏又破的衣服来找他，亲吻他，泄露他的身份，还会把他从高贵的皇宫领走，带他回到贫民窟，过贫困、下等的生活，他便感到不寒而栗。终于，她们几乎彻底不再纠缠在他的脑海中了。他很满意，甚至高兴，因为，每当他们悲伤和责备的脸出现在他面前时，他感到自己比爬行的虫子更可鄙。","Tom’s poor mother and sisters travelled the same road out of his mind.At first he pined for them, sorrowed for them, longed to see them, but later, the thought of their coming some day in their rags and dirt, and betraying him with their kisses, and pulling him down from his lofty place, and dragging him back to penury and degradation and the slums, made him shudder.At last they ceased to trouble his thoughts almost wholly.And he was content, even glad: for, whenever their mournful and accusing faces did rise before him now, they made him feel more despicable than the worms that crawl."
"二月十九日半夜，汤姆·坎蒂正躺在皇宫中华丽的床上沉沉入睡。有皇家的守卫看守着，皇室的壮丽包围着，男孩很高兴，因为明天是他被庄严地加冕为英国国王的日子。而这个时刻，真正的爱德华国王又饿又渴，身上又是土又是泥，走得疲乏，穿的破衣烂衫也被撕碎了——这是骚乱给他带来的后果。他挤进一群人中，那些人正在兴致勃勃地看一组工人匆匆进出威斯敏斯特教堂，像蚂蚁一样忙碌着——他们在为王室加冕典礼做最后的准备。","At midnight of the 19th of February, Tom Canty was sinking to sleep in his rich bed in the palace, guarded by his loyal vassals, and surrounded by the pomps of royalty, a happy boy; for tomorrow was the day appointed for his solemn crowning as King of England.At that same hour, Edward, the true king, hungry and thirsty, soiled and draggled, worn with travel, and clothed in rags and shreds—his share of the results of the riot—was wedged in among a crowd of people who were watching with deep interest certain hurrying gangs of workmen who streamed in and out of Westminster Abbey, busy as ants: they were making the last preparation for the royal coronation."

"第二天早晨汤姆·坎蒂醒来时，空气里浓重地弥漫着隆隆的低语：它充斥了整个空间。这对他来说就是音乐；因为这意味着英格兰国土开始全力忠诚地迎接这伟大的一天。","When Tom Canty awoke the next morning, the air was heavy with a thunderous murmur: all the distances were charged with it.It was music to him; for it meant that the English world was out in its strength to give loyal welcome to the great day."
"不一会儿，汤姆发现自己又成了泰晤士河上盛大游船游行队伍的中心人物，因为根据古老的传统，穿过伦敦的“致意游行”必须从伦敦塔出发，而他正是要去往那里。","Presently Tom found himself once more the chief figure in a wonderful floating pageant on the Thames; for by ancient custom the ‘recognition procession’ through London must start from the Tower, and he was bound thither."
"他到达那里时，庄严的堡垒似乎突然断裂成了上千个断口，每个断口都跳跃着红色的火舌，涌动着白色的烟尘。紧接着，一声震耳欲聋的爆炸声将人群的喊声淹没。喷射的火焰、烟尘和爆炸声连续不断地重复着，其速度令人叫绝，不一会儿，老伦敦塔就消失在自己的烟尘形成大片浓雾中，唯独露出高大白塔的塔尖，同旗子一起从浓重的水汽中凸显出来，像是云层里冒出来的山顶。","When he arrived there, the sides of the venerable fortress seemed suddenly rent in a thousand places, and from every rent leaped a red tongue of flame and a white gush of smoke; a deafening explosion followed, which drowned the shoutings of the multitude, and made the ground tremble; the flame-jets, the smoke, and the explosions, were repeated over and over again with marvellous celerity, so that in a few moments the old Tower disappeared in the vast fog of its own smoke, all but the very top of the tall pile called the White Tower; this, with its banners, stood out above the dense bank of vapour as a mountain-peak projects above a cloud-rack."
"穿着光鲜的汤姆·坎蒂跨上昂首阔步的战马，华丽的马饰几乎拖到了地面。他的“舅舅”摄政大臣萨默塞特公爵同样跨上马，紧随其后。国王的守卫在两边各成一队，穿戴着锃亮的盔甲。摄政大臣的后面是似乎一眼望不到头的华丽的贵族队伍，他们的仆人紧随其后。他们身后是穿着深红色天鹅绒袍子、胸前挂着金链子的市长大人和市政人员。随后是伦敦各行会的官员和成员们，他们穿着鲜艳，举着几个行会招展的旗子。在这个游行队伍中，还有一队在城市里穿行的仪仗队，那就是古老而令人尊敬的礼炮团——那时，这个组织已经存在了三百多年，是英国唯一一支享有不受国会管制的特权的军队（现在仍然享有）。这是一幅壮观的场面，游行队伍庄严地穿过拥挤的人群时，人们一直欢呼向其致敬。史官写道：“当国王进城时，人们向他祈祷、欢迎、高呼，说着温柔的话，用所有能够表现臣民对君主的热切喜爱的手势来欢迎他。对那些站得远的人，国王昂头露出高兴的表情，对离陛下近的人，他说着最温柔的语言。人们感激地给予他祝福，他以同样的感激接受人们的祝福。对所有祝福他的人，他都表示感谢。对于‘上帝保佑陛下’的话，他回以‘上帝保佑你们所有人’并加一句‘全心全意感谢他们’。国王深情的回答和举止让人们激动不已。”","Tom Canty, splendidly arrayed, mounted a prancing war-steed, whose rich trappings almost reached to the ground; his ‘uncle,’ the Lord Protector Somerset, similarly mounted, took place in his rear; the King’s Guard formed in single ranks on either side, clad in burnished armour; after the Protector followed a seemingly interminable procession of resplendent nobles attended by their vassals; after these came the lord mayor and the aldermanic body, in crimson velvet robes, and with their gold chains across their breasts; and after these the officers and members of all the guilds of London, in rich raiment, and bearing the showy banners of the several corporations.Also in the procession, as a special guard of honour through the city, was the Ancient and Honourable Artillery Company—an organisation already three hundred years old at that time, and the only military body in England possessing the privilege (which it still possesses in our day) of holding itself independent of the commands of Parliament.It was a brilliant spectacle, and was hailed with acclamations all along the line, as it took its stately way through the packed multitudes of citizens.The chronicler says, ‘The King, as he entered the city, was received by the people with prayers, welcomings, cries, and tender words, and all signs which argue an earnest love of subjects toward their sovereign; and the King, by holding up his glad countenance to such as stood afar off, and most tender language to those that stood nigh his Grace, showed himself no less thankful to receive the people’s goodwill than they to offer it.To all that wished him well, he gave thanks.To such as bade “God save his Grace,” he said in return, “God save you all!” and added that “he thanked them with all his heart.”Wonderfully transported were the people with the loving answers and gestures of their King.’"
"在芬澈奇街，一个穿着昂贵衣服的漂亮小孩站在台上欢迎陛下来到城里。他的欢迎词的最后一节是这样的：","In Fenchurch Street a ‘fair child, in costly apparel,’ stood on a stage to welcome his Majesty to the city.The last verse of his greeting was in these words—"
"“欢迎，啊，国王！尽心所能够想到的；再一次欢迎，尽语言所能够表达的。欢迎愉快的语言和无所畏惧的内心：上帝保佑您，我们祈祷，愿您永远安康。”","‘Welcome, O King! as much as hearts can think;Welcome, again, as much as tongue can tell,—Welcome to joyous tongues, and hearts that will not shrink: God thee preserve, we pray, and wish thee ever well.’"
"人们高兴地喊着向前冲，异口同声地重复着那个小孩的话。汤姆·坎蒂朝人群扫视一番，人们热切的脸如浪潮一般，让他内心大悦。他觉得世界上唯一值得渴望的事就是做国王，做一个国家的偶像。一会儿，他发现远处有两个垃圾大院的伙伴，他们衣衫褴褛。其中一个在他原来的假宫廷里任海军大臣，另一个在他值得夸耀的幻境里是第一寝官。接着，他的自豪感空前膨胀。噢，假如他们现在真的认出他来就好了！如果他们认出他，发现原来生活在贫民窟和穷街陋巷、受到嘲笑的假国王变成了真国王，杰出的公爵和诸侯是他谦卑的仆人，整个英国都拜倒在他脚下，那该是怎样无法表达的荣耀啊！但是他不得不否定自己，压制自己的欲望，因为如果在这种情况下坦白，可能会产生更严重的后果。所以他转过头，任由两个脏兮兮的小伙子继续他们的呼喊和愉快的奉承，而他们自己对奉承的对象却毫不怀疑。","The people burst forth in a glad shout, repeating with one voice what the child had said.Tom Canty gazed abroad over the surging sea of eager faces, and his heart swelled with exultation; and he felt that the one thing worth living for in this world was to be a king, and a nation’s idol.Presently he caught sight, at a distance, of a couple of his ragged Offal Court comrades—one of them the lord high admiral in his late mimic court, the other the first lord of the bedchamber in the same pretentious fiction; and his pride swelled higher than ever.Oh, if they could only recognise him now!What unspeakable glory it would be, if they could recognise him, and realise that the derided mock king of the slums and back alleys was become a real King, with illustrious dukes and princes for his humble menials, and the English world at his feet!But he had to deny himself, and choke down his desire, for such a recognition might cost more than it would come to: so he turned away his head, and left the two soiled lads to go on with their shoutings and glad adulations, unsuspicious of whom it was they were lavishing them upon."
"时不时有人喊道：“赏赐！赏赐！”于是汤姆就往外抛洒一把锃亮、崭新的硬币，让人群争抢。","Every now and then rose the cry, “A largess! a largess!” and Tom responded by scattering a handful of bright new coins abroad for the multitude to scramble for."
"史官写道：“城中格蕾丝澈奇街北端的鹰标饰前矗立起一座宏伟的拱门，拱门下面是一个舞台，从街道的一边延伸到另一边。这是有关历史的露天表演，呈现着国王较近的祖先的故事。在那儿，约克伊丽莎白坐在很多白色玫瑰中间，花瓣在她周围形成了美丽的裙裾。她旁边是亨利七世，以同样的姿势坐在许多红色玫瑰中。这一对来自皇室的夫妇十指相扣，结婚戒指露在外面，似在炫耀。一根花茎从红色和白色的玫瑰中向上延伸到第二舞台上，这个台子上是亨利八世。他身处红色和白色的玫瑰里，他旁边是新国王的母亲简·西摩的雕像。一跟枝条从这一对夫妇之间伸展出来，爬上了第三舞台，上面是爱德华六世本人的肖像，正在加冕登基。整个露天表演都用红白两色的玫瑰镶上了花边。","The chronicler says, ‘At the upper end of Gracechurch Street, before the sign of the Eagle, the city had erected a gorgeous arch, beneath which was a stage, which stretched from one side of the street to the other.This was an historical pageant, representing the King’s immediate progenitors.There sat Elizabeth of York in the midst of an immense white rose, whose petals formed elaborate furbelows around her; by her side was Henry VII., issuing out of a vast red rose, disposed in the same manner: the hands of the royal pair were locked together, and the wedding-ring ostentatiously displayed.From the red and white roses proceeded a stem, which reached up to a second stage, occupied by Henry VIII., issuing from a red and white rose, with the effigy of the new King’s mother, Jane Seymour, represented by his side.One branch sprang from this pair, which mounted to a third stage, where sat the effigy of Edward VI. himself, enthroned in royal majesty; and the whole pageant was framed with wreaths of roses, red and white.’"
"这样精巧而华美的场景让兴奋的人群如此激动，以至于他们的欢呼声完全盖过了这个孩子细小的声音——这个孩子的任务就是用赞美诗介绍这个场景。但是汤姆·坎蒂不觉得可惜，因为对他来说，无论如何，忠诚的喧闹都是比诗歌更悦耳的音乐。无论到哪里，汤姆都是笑脸盈盈，人们看到他的肖像与他本人十分像，他是肖像有血有肉的版本。于是，人群中突然又爆发出一阵旋风般的掌声。","This quaint and gaudy spectacle so wrought upon the rejoicing people, that their acclamations utterly smothered the small voice of the child whose business it was to explain the thing in eulogistic rhymes.But Tom Canty was not sorry; for this loyal uproar was sweeter music to him than any poetry, no matter what its quality might be.Whithersoever Tom turned his happy young face, the people recognised the exactness of his effigy’s likeness to himself, the flesh and blood counterpart; and new whirlwinds of applause burst forth."
"盛大的游行队伍继续行进着，穿过一道道凯旋门，经过一连串令人眼花缭乱的壮观的、有象征意义的舞台造型，每个舞台都代表和颂扬小国王的某种品德、天赋，或优点。","The great pageant moved on, and still on, under one triumphal arch after another, and past a bewildering succession of spectacular and symbolical tableaux, each of which typified and exalted some virtue, or talent, or merit, of the little King’s."
"“整个齐普赛街，每个阁楼和窗户上都挂着旗子和彩带，街上挂着最华美的地毯、布料、金色的织物，这些都是商店里丰富的货物的样品。另一条街道如这条大道一样华丽，甚至更甚于此。”","‘Throughout the whole of Cheapside, from every penthouse and window, hung banners and streamers; and the richest carpets, stuffs, and cloth-of-gold tapestried the streets—specimens of the great wealth of the stores within; and the splendour of this thoroughfare was equalled in the other streets, and in some even surpassed.’"
"“所有这些奇观和惊喜都是为了欢迎我——我！”汤姆·坎蒂咕哝道。","“And all these wonders and these marvels are to welcome me—me!” murmured Tom Canty."
"假国王的脸颊因兴奋而发红，眼睛闪着光芒，他的感觉沉浸在近乎疯癫的欢乐中。此刻，正当他又举起手抛洒丰厚的赏赐时，他忽然发现一张苍白、惊骇的脸正从第二圈人群中往前挤出来，那炙热的眼睛死死地盯着他。一阵令他眩晕的惊愕袭击了全身，他认出了他的母亲！他飞快地用手遮在眼睛上，手掌朝外——这个无意识的习惯手势因为一件已经记不得的插曲而产生，又由于习惯而永远保留了下来。她立刻从拥挤的人群中挤了出来，越过了守卫，到了他的身边。她抱住他的腿，在上面吻了又吻，哭喊道：“噢，我的孩子，我亲爱的人！”她抬起一张因为高兴和慈爱而变美了的脸，望着他。国王的守卫官立刻骂着将她推走，使她摇摇晃晃地退回到了她用强壮的胳膊使劲推才挤出来的地方。在这件可怜的事情发生时，从汤姆·坎蒂的嘴里吐出了“我不认识你，妇人！”这样的几个字。但是，看到她受到这样的对待，自己心里像被抽打一样。当她回头看了他最后一眼，人群将她淹没，挡住了她视线时，她看起来是如此伤心、如此心碎。一种羞愧感笼罩了他，将他的骄傲烧成了灰烬，让他偷来的王权凋萎。他的那些伟大被打击得一文不值，它们就像腐朽的碎屑一样从他身上剥落下来。","The mock King’s cheeks were flushed with excitement, his eyes were flashing, his senses swam in a delirium of pleasure.At this point, just as he was raising his hand to fling another rich largess, he caught sight of a pale, astounded face, which was strained forward out of the second rank of the crowd, its intense eyes riveted upon him.A sickening consternation struck through him; he recognised his mother! and up flew his hand, palm outward, before his eyes—that old involuntary gesture, born of a forgotten episode, and perpetuated by habit.In an instant more she had torn her way out of the press, and past the guards, and was at his side.She embraced his leg, she covered it with kisses, she cried, “O my child, my darling!” lifting toward him a face that was transfigured with joy and love.The same instant an officer of the King’s Guard snatched her away with a curse, and sent her reeling back whence she came with a vigorous impulse from his strong arm.The words “I do not know you, woman!” were falling from Tom Canty’s lips when this piteous thing occurred; but it smote him to the heart to see her treated so; and as she turned for a last glimpse of him, whilst the crowd was swallowing her from his sight, she seemed so wounded, so broken-hearted, that a shame fell upon him which consumed his pride to ashes, and withered his stolen royalty.His grandeurs were stricken valueless: they seemed to fall away from him like rotten rags."
"游行队伍继续行进着，穿过越来越大的华丽场景，受到越来越热烈的欢迎。但对汤姆来说，这些似乎都不曾存在。他既看不见也听不到。王权不再优美和可爱，它的壮丽变成了一种责备。懊悔正在吞噬他的心。他说：“上帝，真希望能逃脱我的囚牢啊！”","The procession moved on, and still on, through ever augmenting splendours and ever augmenting tempests of welcome; but to Tom Canty they were as if they had not been.He neither saw nor heard.Royalty had lost its grace and sweetness; its pomps were become a reproach.Remorse was eating his heart out.He said, “Would God I were free of my captivity!”"
"无意中，他又开始说他在刚刚被迫接受这崇高地位时说的话。","He had unconsciously dropped back into the phraseology of the first days of his compulsory greatness."
"亮闪闪的游行队伍像一条发光的、长长的蛇，仍然穿梭在精致的老城那弯弯曲曲的巷子里，经过欢呼的居民们。而国王仍旧骑着马，低着头，眼神茫然，眼里只能看到母亲的脸和她受伤的神情。","The shining pageant still went winding like a radiant and interminable serpent down the crooked lanes of the quaint old city, and through the huzzaing hosts; but still the King rode with bowed head and vacant eyes, seeing only his mother’s face and that wounded look in it."
"“赏赐，赏赐！”他的耳朵没有听到这些喊声。","“Largess, largess!”The cry fell upon an unheeding ear."
"“英国国王爱德华万岁！”呼喊声震天动地，但是国王没有反应。他听着它，就像是远处海浪拍岸的声音传进了耳朵里，因为它被另外一种更近的声音所压制了。那个声音在他胸腔里，在他自责的良心里，那是一个一直在重复那句羞耻的话的声音：“我不认识你，妇人！”","“Long live Edward of England!”It seemed as if the earth shook with the explosion; but there was no response from the King.He heard it only as one hears the thunder of the surf when it is blown to the ear out of a great distance, for it was smothered under another sound which was still nearer, in his own breast, in his accusing conscience—a voice which kept repeating those shameful words, “I do not know you, woman!”"
"这句话打击着国王的灵魂，好像葬礼的钟声打击着一个活着的朋友的灵魂，因为钟声让他记起他的秘密背叛使去世之人遭受的痛苦。","The words smote upon the King’s soul as the strokes of a funeral bell smite upon the soul of a surviving friend when they remind him of secret treacheries suffered at his hands by him that is gone."
"每个转弯处都有新的壮丽场景出现，新的奇迹、新的惊奇一一映入眼帘。等待的大炮释放了积压的喧腾，等待的人群从喉咙里倾泻出新的欢呼，可是国王没有任何回应，他能听到的只有那个责备的声音，在他不舒服的胸膛里呻吟。","New glories were unfolded at every turning; new wonders, new marvels, sprang into view; the pent clamours of waiting batteries were released; new raptures poured from the throats of the waiting multitudes: but the King gave no sign, and the accusing voice that went moaning through his comfortless breast was all the sound he heard."
"人群脸上的高兴渐渐有些变化，似乎在关心或忧虑着什么，连掌声都变小了。摄政大臣很快注意到了这些，他也很快地找到了原因。他驱马来到国王旁边，在马鞍上弯下身，摘了帽子,说：","By-and-by the gladness in the faces of the populace changed a little, and became touched with a something like solicitude or anxiety: an abatement in the volume of the applause was observable too.The Lord Protector was quick to notice these things: he was as quick to detect the cause.He spurred to the King’s side, bent low in his saddle, uncovered, and said—"
"“我的君主，现在不是做梦的时间。人们注意到了您低下的头和您阴郁的神情，他们以为这是一个征兆。听话，为王权的太阳掀开面纱，让它照耀在这些不吉的水汽上，驱散它们。抬起您的脸，对人们微笑。”","“My liege, it is an ill time for dreaming.The people observe thy downcast head, thy clouded mien, and they take it for an omen.Be advised: unveil the sun of royalty, and let it shine upon these boding vapours, and disperse them.Lift up thy face, and smile upon the people.”"
"这么说着，公爵到处洒了一把硬币，又回到了自己的位置上。假国王机械地按照他说的做了。他的微笑不是发自内心的，只有很少离得很近或很敏锐的眼睛才能够看透。他点点饰有羽毛的头，向他的臣民致意，非常优雅和亲切。他非常慷慨地从手里给予他们赏赐，人们的焦虑也因此不见了，又爆发出像以前一样热烈的欢呼。","So saying, the Duke scattered a handful of coins to right and left, then retired to his place.The mock King did mechanically as he had been bidden.His smile had no heart in it, but few eyes were near enough or sharp enough to detect that.The noddings of his plumed head as he saluted his subjects were full of grace and graciousness; the largess which he delivered from his hand was royally liberal: so the people’s anxiety vanished, and the acclamations burst forth again in as mighty a volume as before."
"游行快要结束时，公爵还是不得不再一次驾马向前去进谏。他低声说：","Still once more, a little before the progress was ended, the Duke was obliged to ride forward, and make remonstrance.He whispered—"
"“噢，敬畏的君主！摆脱这些阴郁的心情吧，世人的眼睛都在看着您。”","“O dread sovereign! shake off these fatal humours; the eyes of the world are upon thee.”"
"接着，他又带着严厉的怒气说：“让那个疯乞丐受死!是她打扰了陛下。”","Then he added with sharp annoyance, “Perdition catch that crazy pauper! ’twas she that hath disturbed your Highness.”"
"这个美丽的人物转过头，眼睛黯然无光地看了看公爵，死气沉沉地说道：","The gorgeous figure turned a lustreless eye upon the Duke, and said in a dead voice—"
"“她是我的母亲！”","“She was my mother!”"
"“我的天啊！”摄政大臣沉吟道，纵马回到了自己的位置上，“征兆预言得对。他又疯了！”","“My God!” groaned the Protector as he reined his horse backward to his post, “the omen was pregnant with prophecy.He is gone mad again!”"
"第三十二章 加冕日","Chapter XXXII  Coronation Day"
"让我们倒回几个钟头，回到难忘的加冕日那天凌晨四点的威斯敏斯特教堂。我们不是没有伴，因为，虽然仍在夜里，我们发现在点着火炬的楼座里已坐满了人。他们非常愿意安静地坐着等待七八个小时，好观看他们一生不会见第二次的事情——国王的加冕仪式。是的，从三点预告炮声响起时，伦敦和威斯敏斯特就开始骚动起来，买到进入楼座起居室特权的没有头衔的富裕市民们已经开始从给他们预留的门口涌入。","Let us go backward a few hours, and place ourselves in Westminster Abbey, at four o’clock in the morning of this memorable Coronation Day.We are not without company; for although it is still night, we find the torch-lighted galleries already filling up with people who are well content to sit still and wait seven or eight hours till the time shall come for them to see what they may not hope to see twice in their lives—the coronation of a King.Yes, London and Westminster have been astir ever since the warning guns boomed at three o’clock, and already crowds of untitled rich folk who have bought the privilege of trying to find sitting-room in the galleries are flocking in at the entrances reserved for their sort."
"时间非常枯燥地一点点流逝。有一会儿，所有骚动都停止了，因为每个楼座早已经坐满了人。我们现在可以坐下来，悠闲地观看和思索了。我们透过昏暗的大教堂中的黎明曙光到处看去，可以看到许多挤满了人的楼座和阳台，这些楼座和阳台的其他部分被中间的柱子和建筑突出的部分挡住了。我们能够看到壮观的整个北十字型翼部，那里空空的，正在恭候着英国有特权的人们。我们还能够看到，宽敞的区域或平台上铺着华丽的地毯，那是王座所在的地方。王座占据了平台的中心，位于四级阶梯上托高的平台处。在王座里有一块大致扁平的石块，那是斯昆石——许多代苏格兰国王坐在上面被加冕，因此后来它变得十分神圣，可以用来为英国君王加冕。王座和脚凳上都包着金色的布料。","The hours drag along tediously enough.All stir has ceased for some time, for every gallery has long ago been packed.We may sit, now, and look and think at our leisure.We have glimpses, here and there and yonder, through the dim cathedral twilight, of portions of many galleries and balconies, wedged full with other people, the other portions of these galleries and balconies being cut off from sight by intervening pillars and architectural projections.We have in view the whole of the great north transept—empty, and waiting for England’s privileged ones.We see also the ample area or platform, carpeted with rich stuffs, whereon the throne stands.The throne occupies the centre of the platform, and is raised above it upon an elevation of four steps.Within the seat of the throne is enclosed a rough flat rock—the stone of Scone—which many generations of Scottish kings sat on to be crowned, and so it in time became holy enough to answer a like purpose for English monarchs.Both the throne and its footstool are covered with cloth of gold."
"四周一片寂静，火炬无精打采地闪烁着，时间拖拉着沉重的脚步一点一滴地流逝。但是，迟来的日光终于宣布了自己的到来。火炬熄灭了，柔美的光线充满了这个伟大的地方。现在，这座高贵的建筑的所有特点都清晰可见，只是显得柔和而梦幻，因为太阳微微被云层遮掩。","Stillness reigns, the torches blink dully, the time drags heavily.But at last the lagging daylight asserts itself, the torches are extinguished, and a mellow radiance suffuses the great spaces.All features of the noble building are distinct now, but soft and dreamy, for the sun is lightly veiled with clouds."
"七点钟时，这令人昏睡的单调第一次被打破了。七点的钟声一敲响，第一贵夫人走进了教堂的十字型翼部，穿得像光彩壮丽的所罗门。一名穿着绸缎和天鹅绒衣服的官员将她引至指定的位置，一个与他装扮相同的人同时托着夫人的长裙摆跟在后面，等夫人入座后，帮她将裙摆整理在她的腿前。接着，他按她的意思把脚凳放好，然后将她的宝冠放在她伸手可及的地方，方便到时同时为贵族加冕。","At seven o’clock the first break in the drowsy monotony occurs; for on the stroke of this hour the first peeress enters the transept, clothed like Solomon for splendour, and is conducted to her appointed place by an official clad in satins and velvets, whilst a duplicate of him gathers up the lady’s long train, follows after, and, when the lady is seated, arranges the train across her lap for her.He then places her footstool according to her desire, after which he puts her coronet where it will be convenient to her hand when the time for the simultaneous coroneting of the nobles shall arrive."
"这时，光鲜亮丽的贵族夫人们络绎不绝地走进来，穿着绸缎的官员到处飘来飘去，闪闪烁烁，引领她们入座，并把她们安顿好。这个场面已经够活泼的了。到处人头攒动、生机勃勃、色彩变幻。过了一会儿，一切又恢复了安静，因为所有的贵夫人都到齐并入了座。这些花儿般美丽的女士足足占了一英亩的面积，她们缤纷多彩地盛开着，闪着冷光，像是镶着钻石的银河。这里什么年纪的人都有：棕色皮肤、满脸皱纹、头发花白的贵妇，好像可以沿着时间之河往回、再往回追溯，甚至能想起爱德华三世的加冕的日子，还有那些古老的、被遗忘的年代里动乱的日子。此外还有端庄的中年女爵士、可爱而优雅的年轻主妇、温柔而美丽的年轻女孩们，眼睛放着光芒，表情清新。在那伟大的时刻到来时，她们可能会笨手笨脚地戴上自己镶了珠宝的宝冠，因为她们对此不熟悉，而且她们的激动很是碍事，令人不悦。可是，这也许不会发生，因为这些小姐们都梳了特别的发型，好在信号发出时能够快速而成功地将宝冠戴在正确的位置。","By this time the peeresses are flowing in in a glittering stream, and the satin-clad officials are flitting and glinting everywhere, seating them and making them comfortable.The scene is animated enough now.There is stir and life, and shifting colour everywhere.After a time, quiet reigns again; for the peeresses are all come and are all in their places, a solid acre or such a matter, of human flowers, resplendent in variegated colours, and frosted like a Milky Way with diamonds.There are all ages here: brown, wrinkled, white-haired dowagers who are able to go back, and still back, down the stream of time, and recall the crowning of Richard III. and the troublous days of that old forgotten age; and there are handsome middle-aged dames; and lovely and gracious young matrons; and gentle and beautiful young girls, with beaming eyes and fresh complexions, who may possibly put on their jewelled coronets awkwardly when the great time comes; for the matter will be new to them, and their excitement will be a sore hindrance.Still, this may not happen, for the hair of all these ladies has been arranged with a special view to the swift and successful lodging of the crown in its place when the signal comes."
"我们看到这么多的贵夫人都戴着硕大的钻石，我们也看到这是一幅绝妙的景象。不过现在，我们就要真正地惊叹了。大约九点，云彩突然不见了踪影，一束太阳光穿过柔美的空气，沿着一排一排的夫人、小姐慢慢地漂移。光线每移到一排，就使这一排壮丽得眼花缭乱，仿佛燃烧成多彩的火焰。这种令人惊奇的美丽景象就像电流穿过我们的身体，使我们的指尖感到麻刺。不一会儿，一位从东方某个遥远偏僻的地方来的特使带着所有外国大使走进来，跨过这一束阳光，我们屏气凝神。他周身流动、闪烁和跳跃着的华丽让人倾倒，因为他从头到脚都佩戴了宝石。他迈着细碎的步子，抛洒了一圈跳跃的光芒。","We have seen that this massed array of peeresses is sown thick with diamonds, and we also see that it is a marvellous spectacle—but now we are about to be astonished in earnest.About nine, the clouds suddenly break away and a shaft of sunshine cleaves the mellow atmosphere, and drifts slowly along the ranks of ladies; and every rank it touches flames into a dazzling splendour of many-coloured fires, and we tingle to our finger-tips with the electric thrill that is shot through us by the surprise and the beauty of the spectacle!Presently a special envoy from some distant corner of the Orient, marching with the general body of foreign ambassadors, crosses this bar of sunshine, and we catch our breath, the glory that streams and flashes and palpitates about him is so overpowering; for he is crusted from head to heel with gems, and his slightest movement showers a dancing radiance all around him."
"为方便起见，让我们改变一下叙述的时态。时间流逝——一小时，两小时，两个半小时。楼座里低沉的隆隆声骤起，说明国王和他壮观的队伍终于来了，这让等待的人群欢腾了起来。大家都知道还得等一会儿，因为国王必须为这庄严的仪式充分准备并换上长袍。不过，等待的时间是愉快的，因为王国的贵族们正穿着庄重的长袍一起走来。他们被隆重地引至自己的座位，为了方便，他们的宝冠就放在手边。同时，楼座里的人群兴致勃勃，因为他们大多是第一次看到真正的公爵、伯爵和男爵，这些姓氏已经在历史上存在了五百年。当所有人都最终入了座，从楼座和所有有利位置看的景象都是完整的。这是一幅值得观看和记忆的华丽场景。","Let us change the tense for convenience.The time drifted along—one hour—two hours—two hours and a half; then the deep booming of artillery told that the King and his grand procession had arrived at last; so the waiting multitude rejoiced.All knew that a further delay must follow, for the King must be prepared and robed for the solemn ceremony; but this delay would be pleasantly occupied by the assembling of the peers of the realm in their stately robes.These were conducted ceremoniously to their seats, and their coronets placed conveniently at hand; and meanwhile the multitude in the galleries were alive with interest, for most of them were beholding for the first time, dukes, earls, and barons, whose names had been historical for five hundred years.When all were finally seated, the spectacle from the galleries and all coigns of vantage was complete; a gorgeous one to look upon and to remember."
"现在，穿着长袍、戴着主教冠的伟大的教堂首领以及他们的随从陆续走上平台，到了指定的位置上，紧随其后的是摄政大臣及其他重要官员，其后又跟着身穿钢甲的守卫特遣队。","Now the robed and mitred great heads of the church, and their attendants, filed in upon the platform and took their appointed places; these were followed by the Lord Protector and other great officials, and these again by a steel-clad detachment of the Guard."
"一切都停下，等待了一段时间，然后，随着一声信号，现场爆发出响亮的喜庆的音乐，汤姆·坎蒂身穿金色的长袍，出现在门口，迈上了平台。所有人都起立，致意仪式就此开始。","There was a waiting pause; then, at a signal, a triumphant peal of music burst forth, and Tom Canty, clothed in a long robe of cloth of gold, appeared at a door, and stepped upon the platform.The entire multitude rose, and the ceremony of the Recognition ensued."
"接着，一首崇高的圣歌响起，声音浑厚悠扬，响彻大教堂。在这样的宣报和欢迎之后，汤姆·坎蒂被引至王座。古老的仪式继续进行，其庄严令人难忘，而观众都凝视着。当仪式越来越接近尾声，汤姆·坎蒂的脸色变得苍白，越来越苍白，一种深深的、并持续加深的悲伤和失望笼罩了他的精神和他悔恨的心灵。","Then a noble anthem swept the Abbey with its rich waves of sound; and thus heralded and welcomed, Tom Canty was conducted to the throne.The ancient ceremonies went on, with impressive solemnity, whilst the audience gazed; and as they drew nearer and nearer to completion, Tom Canty grew pale, and still paler, and a deep and steadily deepening woe and despondency settled down upon his spirits and upon his remorseful heart."
"终于，最后的阶段就要到来。坎特伯雷大主教从垫子上举起英格兰王冠，举到正在瑟瑟发抖的假国王的头顶上。正在此刻，一道彩虹的光彩闪过这座宽敞教堂的十字架翼部，因为这些贵族个个都同时将一顶宝冠举起来、置于他或她的头顶之上，然后停在了这个姿势上。","At last the final act was at hand.The Archbishop of Canterbury lifted up the crown of England from its cushion and held it out over the trembling mock-King’s head.In the same instant a rainbow-radiance flashed along the spacious transept; for with one impulse every individual in the great concourse of nobles lifted a coronet and poised it over his or her head—and paused in that attitude."
"大教堂里一片深沉的安静。在这令人难忘的时刻，一个惊人的幽灵侵入这一幕——专心致志的人们没有看到这个幽灵，直到它突然出现，在宏伟的中央走廊里移动。这是个男孩，没戴帽子，鞋破了，穿着破破烂烂的平民的粗布衣服。与他那肮脏可怜的形象十分不相称地，他庄严地举起手，并说出如下的警示：","A deep hush pervaded the Abbey.At this impressive moment, a startling apparition intruded upon the scene—an apparition observed by none in the absorbed multitude, until it suddenly appeared, moving up the great central aisle.It was a boy, bareheaded, ill shod, and clothed in coarse plebeian garments that were falling to rags.He raised his hand with a solemnity which ill comported with his soiled and sorry aspect, and delivered this note of warning—"
"“我禁止你将英格兰王冠放在那个要掉的脑袋上。我是国王！”","“I forbid you to set the crown of England upon that forfeited head.I am the King!”"
"一瞬间，几只愤怒的手落在了男孩身上。但在同一时刻，穿着帝王服饰的汤姆·坎蒂迅速向前迈了一步，响亮地喊道：","In an instant several indignant hands were laid upon the boy; but in the same instant Tom Canty, in his regal vestments, made a swift step forward, and cried out in a ringing voice—"
"“放开他，退下！他是国王！”","“Loose him and forbear!He IS the King!”"
"一种惊讶的慌乱席卷了人群，他们在自己位置上半起半坐，困惑地看看彼此，又看看这场景的主角，好像想知道自己是清醒和理智的、还是在睡觉和做梦。摄政大臣和其他人一样惊奇，不过很快就清醒了过来，威严地大声说：","A sort of panic of astonishment swept the assemblage, and they partly rose in their places and stared in a bewildered way at one another and at the chief figures in this scene, like persons who wondered whether they were awake and in their senses, or asleep and dreaming.The Lord Protector was as amazed as the rest, but quickly recovered himself, and exclaimed in a voice of authority—"
"“不用担心陛下，他的病又犯了——抓住这个游民！”","“Mind not his Majesty, his malady is upon him again—seize the vagabond!”"
"他的命令正要被执行，可是假国王跺着脚大声说道：","He would have been obeyed, but the mock-King stamped his foot and cried out—"
"“找死！别动他，他是国王！”","“On your peril!Touch him not, he is the King!”"
"那些手缩了回去，屋子里的人都陷入静止的状态，没人动，没人说话。确实，在这样奇怪和意外的突发状况下，没人知道该怎么办，或者说什么。当所有人的脑子都在努力寻找正确答案的时候，男孩仍以高昂的姿态和自信的风度继续往前走着，他一开始就没有停下来。当人们混乱的思维仍在徒劳地挣扎时，他走上了平台。假国王满脸高兴地跑去与他相见，他双膝跪在他面前，说道：","The hands were withheld; a paralysis fell upon the house; no one moved, no one spoke; indeed, no one knew how to act or what to say, in so strange and surprising an emergency.While all minds were struggling to right themselves, the boy still moved steadily forward, with high port and confident mien; he had never halted from the beginning; and while the tangled minds still floundered helplessly, he stepped upon the platform, and the mock-King ran with a glad face to meet him; and fell on his knees before him and said—"
"“噢，我的陛下，国王，让可怜的汤姆·坎蒂先表达他对您的忠诚，并让他说：‘请戴上王冠，做回您自己！’”","“Oh, my lord the King, let poor Tom Canty be first to swear fealty to thee, and say, ‘Put on thy crown and enter into thine own again!’”"
"摄政大臣的眼睛严厉地盯着新来者的脸，但严厉之色很快消失了，取而代之的是一种惊奇的表情。其他几位主要官员也发生了这样的变化。他们面面相觑，都不约而同地往后退了一步。每个人脑海中想的都是：“多奇怪啊，他们真像！”摄政大臣困惑地思索了片刻，接着，他十分恭敬地说：","The Lord Protector’s eye fell sternly upon the new-comer’s face; but straightway the sternness vanished away, and gave place to an expression of wondering surprise.This thing happened also to the other great officers.They glanced at each other, and retreated a step by a common and unconscious impulse.The thought in each mind was the same: “What a strange resemblance!”The Lord Protector reflected a moment or two in perplexity, then he said, with grave respectfulness—"
"“对不起，先生，我想问几个问题——”","“By your favour, sir, I desire to ask certain questions which—”"
"“我会一一回答的，尊敬的阁下。”","“I will answer them, my lord.”"
"公爵问了他许多关于宫廷、去世的国王、还有王子和公主的问题，而这个男孩都毫不犹豫地给出了正确回答。他描述了宫廷里国事房间、去世的国王的寓所，以及威尔士王子的寓所。","The Duke asked him many questions about the Court, the late King, the prince, the princesses—the boy answered them correctly and without hesitating.He described the rooms of state in the palace, the late King’s apartments, and those of the Prince of Wales."
"这很奇怪，令人惊奇。是的，这无法解释——听到这些的人都这么说。潮水走向开始变了，汤姆·坎蒂逃走的愿望越来越强烈。忽然，摄政大臣摇摇头，说道：","It was strange; it was wonderful; yes, it was unaccountable—so all said that heard it.The tide was beginning to turn, and Tom Canty’s hopes to run high, when the Lord Protector shook his head and said—"
"“这确实是最惊奇的，可是我们的国王也能做同样的事情。”这句话，这句仍把他自己说成是国王的话，让汤姆·坎蒂伤心至极，他觉得他的希望在破灭。“这些不能作为证据。”摄政大臣又说道。","“It is true it is most wonderful—but it is no more than our lord the King likewise can do.”This remark, and this reference to himself as still the King, saddened Tom Canty, and he felt his hopes crumbling from under him.“These are not proofs,” added the Protector."
"现在潮水正快速地转向，真的非常快，但是方向不对：它将可怜的汤姆·坎蒂留在王座上，进退两难，却将另一个冲向了大海。摄政大臣自己想了想，摇摇头，这个思想又挤进了他的脑袋：“玩这样致命的游戏，对国家和我们大家都是危险的。它可能分裂国家，推翻王权。”他转过来说道：","The tide was turning very fast now, very fast indeed—but in the wrong direction; it was leaving poor Tom Canty stranded on the throne, and sweeping the other out to sea.The Lord Protector communed with himself—shook his head—the thought forced itself upon him, “It is perilous to the State and to us all, to entertain so fateful a riddle as this; it could divide the nation and undermine the throne.”He turned and said—"
"“托马斯先生，逮捕他——不，等等！”他两颊发光，对这个衣衫褴褛的竞争者提出这样一个问题：","“Sir Thomas, arrest this—No, hold!”His face lighted, and he confronted the ragged candidate with this question—"
"“御玺在哪儿？如实回答我这个问题，谜题就有谜底了，因为只有威尔士王子能回答出来！王位和王朝就系在这么微小的事情上！”","“Where lieth the Great Seal?Answer me this truly, and the riddle is unriddled; for only he that was Prince of Wales CAN so answer!On so trivial a thing hang a throne and a dynasty!”"
"这是一个幸运的想法，一个令人高兴的想法。朝臣要员们环顾四周，彼此投去欢快赞许的目光，像沉默的掌声，证明他们也是这么认为的。是的，只有真正的王子能解开御玺丢失这个棘手的谜题——无助的小冒名顶替者功课学得很好，但是他的功课在这里不灵验了，因为他的老师自己都不知道这个问题的答案。啊，非常好，的确非常好，现在我们就要迅速地摆脱这个烦人而危险的事情了。所以他们满意地悄然点头，内心在微笑，打算看这个愚蠢的家伙被内疚的慌乱击中而瘫痪。接着，他们没有看到这样的事情发生。多么令人惊奇啊，他们惊讶地听到他立即自信而悠然地回答道：","It was a lucky thought, a happy thought.That it was so considered by the great officials was manifested by the silent applause that shot from eye to eye around their circle in the form of bright approving glances.Yes, none but the true prince could dissolve the stubborn mystery of the vanished Great Seal—this forlorn little impostor had been taught his lesson well, but here his teachings must fail, for his teacher himself could not answer that question—ah, very good, very good indeed; now we shall be rid of this troublesome and perilous business in short order!And so they nodded invisibly and smiled inwardly with satisfaction, and looked to see this foolish lad stricken with a palsy of guilty confusion.How surprised they were, then, to see nothing of the sort happen—how they marvelled to hear him answer up promptly, in a confident and untroubled voice, and say—"
"“这个谜题一点儿都不难。”接着，他没有对任何人说请勿见怪之类的话，就回头下达了命令，样子十分从容，像是他做惯了这些似的：“圣约翰阁下，到宫殿里我的私人内阁去——因为没有人比你更了解那个地方。挨着地板，在接待室的门左边的最远的角落，你会看到墙上有个黄铜钉头，按它一下，一个小珠宝壁橱就会弹开。这个连你都不知道——不，除了我和设计它的可信的工匠，世界上所有其他人都不知道。映入你眼帘的第一件东西就是御玺，把它拿到这儿来。”","“There is nought in this riddle that is difficult.”Then, without so much as a by-your-leave to anybody, he turned and gave this command, with the easy manner of one accustomed to doing such things: “My Lord St. John, go you to my private cabinet in the palace—for none knoweth the place better than you—and, close down to the floor, in the left corner remotest from the door that opens from the ante-chamber, you shall find in the wall a brazen nail-head; press upon it and a little jewel-closet will fly open which not even you do know of—no, nor any soul else in all the world but me and the trusty artisan that did contrive it for me.The first thing that falleth under your eye will be the Great Seal—fetch it hither.”"
"所有的人都对这段话感到十分惊讶，当看到小乞丐毫不犹豫、看起来一点儿也不怕出错地叫出这位贵族，而且那么平静有力地叫他的名字，仿佛认识了他一辈子时，更是惊讶不已。这位贵族几乎惊讶得要执行命令了。他甚至做出了要走的架势，但是他的态度很快恢复了平静，并为自己的莽撞而红了脸。汤姆·坎蒂转向他，严厉地说：","All the company wondered at this speech, and wondered still more to see the little mendicant pick out this peer without hesitancy or apparent fear of mistake, and call him by name with such a placidly convincing air of having known him all his life.The peer was almost surprised into obeying.He even made a movement as if to go, but quickly recovered his tranquil attitude and confessed his blunder with a blush.Tom Canty turned upon him and said, sharply—"
"“你为什么犹豫？没有听到国王的命令吗？去！”","“Why dost thou hesitate?Hast not heard the King’s command?Go!”"
"圣约翰阁下深深鞠了躬，可以看出，那是非常谨慎和不明朗的鞠躬，没有朝向任何一个国王，而是朝二者中间的地方，然后就离开了。","The Lord St. John made a deep obeisance—and it was observed that it was a significantly cautious and non-committal one, it not being delivered at either of the kings, but at the neutral ground about half-way between the two—and took his leave."
"现在这些官员慢慢地开始有种极其微小的动作，几乎察觉不到，却一直存在，仿佛是将万花筒慢慢地旋转时可以看到的动作——一个美丽集合中的元素散掉，形成另一种组合。现在，这个动作渐渐地将站在汤姆·坎蒂身边闪闪发光的人群解散了，并将他们聚集到了旁边新来者的周围。汤姆·坎蒂几乎是孤零零一人站在那里。现在接着是一阵短暂而深沉的暂停和等待。其间，甚至连仍留在汤姆·坎蒂身边的寥寥几个胆小的人都逐渐鼓足了勇气，一个个悄悄地走到大多数那边。所以，最后，穿着皇袍、戴着珠宝的汤姆·坎蒂孤零零地站在那里，与世世隔绝了，一个显眼的人物就这样站在了华丽的空地儿。","Now began a movement of the gorgeous particles of that official group which was slow, scarcely perceptible, and yet steady and persistent—a movement such as is observed in a kaleidoscope that is turned slowly, whereby the components of one splendid cluster fall away and join themselves to another—a movement which, little by little, in the present case, dissolved the glittering crowd that stood about Tom Canty and clustered it together again in the neighbourhood of the new-comer.Tom Canty stood almost alone.Now ensued a brief season of deep suspense and waiting—during which even the few faint hearts still remaining near Tom Canty gradually scraped together courage enough to glide, one by one, over to the majority.So at last Tom Canty, in his royal robes and jewels, stood wholly alone and isolated from the world, a conspicuous figure, occupying an eloquent vacancy."
"这时，我们看到圣约翰大人回来了。当他往前踏上中央走廊时，人们的关心如此热切，伟大的人群中窃窃私语的谈话声消失了，接着是深邃的寂静，呼吸都静止了，从中传来他枯燥而遥远的脚步声。他走近时，每只眼睛都在死死地盯着他。他走到平台，停顿了一下，然后朝汤姆·坎蒂深深地鞠躬，说道：","Now the Lord St. John was seen returning.As he advanced up the mid-aisle the interest was so intense that the low murmur of conversation in the great assemblage died out and was succeeded by a profound hush, a breathless stillness, through which his footfalls pulsed with a dull and distant sound.Every eye was fastened upon him as he moved along.He reached the platform, paused a moment, then moved toward Tom Canty with a deep obeisance, and said—"
"“陛下，御玺不在那儿！”","“Sire, the Seal is not there!”"
"面色苍白的、害怕的朝臣们离开了衣衫褴褛的索求王座的人，比暴徒离开一个瘟疫病人还要快。一瞬间，剩他一人站在那儿，没有朋友或支持者，人们嘲弄和愤怒的眼神像仇恨的火焰一样像他扑来。摄政大臣愤怒地大喊道：","A mob does not melt away from the presence of a plague-patient with more haste than the band of pallid and terrified courtiers melted away from the presence of the shabby little claimant of the Crown.In a moment he stood all alone, without friend or supporter, a target upon which was concentrated a bitter fire of scornful and angry looks.The Lord Protector called out fiercely—"
"“把这个乞丐扔到街上，游街鞭打他——不需要再为这个无足轻重的流氓费神！”","“Cast the beggar into the street, and scourge him through the town—the paltry knave is worth no more consideration!”"
"守卫官员上前执行命令，但是汤姆挥手令其退下，说道：","Officers of the guard sprang forward to obey, but Tom Canty waved them off and said—"
"“退下！谁碰他，就是找死！”","“Back!Whoso touches him perils his life!”"
"摄政大臣困惑至极。他对圣约翰阁下说:","The Lord Protector was perplexed in the last degree.He said to the Lord St. John—"
"“你仔细找了吗？可是问这个也没用。这件事确实蹊跷。人们不会因为丢了小东西，或是鸡毛蒜皮的小事而感到奇怪，但是英格兰御玺这么大的东西怎么会不见了，而且没有人能够再找到它——一个又大又沉的金圆盘形状的——”","“Searched you well?—but it boots not to ask that.It doth seem passing strange.Little things, trifles, slip out of one’s ken, and one does not think it matter for surprise; but how so bulky a thing as the Seal of England can vanish away and no man be able to get track of it again—a massy golden disk—”"
"汤姆·坎蒂两眼放光，上前喊道:","Tom Canty, with beaming eyes, sprang forward and shouted—"
"“等等，这就够了！它是圆的吗？还很厚？上面还刻有文字和图案？——是吗？噢，我现在知道令人如此担心和烦恼的御玺是什么了。如果你对我描述一下，三个星期之前你就找到它了。我很清楚它在哪儿，但最初不是我把它放在那里的。”","“Hold, that is enough!Was it round?—and thick?—and had it letters and devices graved upon it?—yes?Oh, now I know what this Great Seal is that there’s been such worry and pother about.An’ ye had described it to me, ye could have had it three weeks ago.Right well I know where it lies; but it was not I that put it there—first.”"
"“那么，是谁呢，陛下？”摄政大臣问道。","“Who, then, my liege?” asked the Lord Protector."
"“站在那儿的人——真正的英国国王。他会亲自告诉你它在哪儿，然后你会相信他自己本来就知道的。您想想，我的国王，激活你的记忆。那是最后，就是你那天穿着我的破衣服，从宫殿里跑出去惩罚羞辱我的士兵之前所做的最后一件事。”","“He that stands there—the rightful King of England.And he shall tell you himself where it lies—then you will believe he knew it of his own knowledge.Bethink thee, my King—spur thy memory—it was the last, the very last thing thou didst that day before thou didst rush forth from the palace, clothed in my rags, to punish the soldier that insulted me.”"
"接下来是一阵安静，没有任何动作或私语打扰，所有的眼睛都盯着新来的人。他站着，歪着脑袋，皱着眉头，从繁多无用的记忆中搜寻一件易忘的小事情——找到它，将让他登上王位；找不到，他将永远是现在的他——一个贫儿和流浪者。时间一瞬又一瞬地流过，几个瞬间就积累成分钟，而这个男孩子仍然在默默地挣扎，没有任何反应。可是最后，他叹了口气，慢慢地摇了摇头，嘴唇发抖、声音沮丧地说：","A silence ensued, undisturbed by a movement or a whisper, and all eyes were fixed upon the new-comer, who stood, with bent head and corrugated brow, groping in his memory among a thronging multitude of valueless recollections for one single little elusive fact, which, found, would seat him upon a throne—unfound, would leave him as he was, for good and all—a pauper and an outcast.Moment after moment passed—the moments built themselves into minutes—still the boy struggled silently on, and gave no sign.But at last he heaved a sigh, shook his head slowly, and said, with a trembling lip and in a despondent voice—"
"“我回忆那一幕——完整地回忆，但就是想不起来御玺的事。”他停顿一下，然后抬起头，带着温柔的高贵说道：“阁下和先生们，如果你们因为他不能提供证据，就要夺去你们真正的君王的王权，我无能为力，也许阻止不了你们。但是——”","“I call the scene back—all of it—but the Seal hath no place in it.”He paused, then looked up, and said with gentle dignity, “My lords and gentlemen, if ye will rob your rightful sovereign of his own for lack of this evidence which he is not able to furnish, I may not stay ye, being powerless.But—”"
"“噢，愚蠢，噢，疯狂，我的国王！”汤姆·坎蒂惊慌地喊道，“等一下！想想！不要放弃！事情还没有失败!也不会失败！听着我说的话，跟上每个字，我要重现那天早上，每个偶然的细节，就像当时发生的一样。我们谈话，我告诉您我的姐姐娜恩和贝特——啊，是的，您记得这个。我告诉您我的老奶奶的事，还有垃圾大院里的伙伴玩的粗野的游戏——是的，您也记得这些。很好，接着跟我想，您会记起每一件事。您给我吃的、喝的，用高贵的手势让仆人退下，这样我卑微的出身就不会在他们面前出丑——啊，是的，这个您也记得。”","“Oh, folly, oh, madness, my King!”cried Tom Canty, in a panic, “wait!—think!Do not give up!—the cause is not lost!Nor shall be, neither!List to what I say—follow every word—I am going to bring that morning back again, every hap just as it happened.We talked—I told you of my sisters, Nan and Bet—ah, yes, you remember that; and about mine old grandam—and the rough games of the lads of Offal Court—yes, you remember these things also; very well, follow me still, you shall recall everything.You gave me food and drink, and did with princely courtesy send away the servants, so that my low breeding might not shame me before them—ah, yes, this also you remember.”"
"当汤姆一一核对细节，另一个男孩点头表示对其认同的时候，这众多的观众和官员迷惑而惊奇地凝视着。故事听起来像真的，但是一个王子和一个乞儿怎么可能联系在一起呢？以前从没有这么一个人群感到如此困惑，如此有趣，又是如此瞠目结舌。","As Tom checked off his details, and the other boy nodded his head in recognition of them, the great audience and the officials stared in puzzled wonderment; the tale sounded like true history, yet how could this impossible conjunction between a prince and a beggar-boy have come about?Never was a company of people so perplexed, so interested, and so stupefied, before."
"“为了好玩，我的王子，我们换了衣服。接着，我站在镜子前面，而我们如此相像，都说像是没有换过衣服一样——是的，您记得这个。接着，您注意到那个士兵伤了我的手——看！这儿，我现在甚至都不能用它写字，手指特别僵硬。于是殿下跳起来，发誓要报复那个士兵，就朝门口跑去了。您经过一张桌子——你们称之为御玺的东西就放在那张桌子上。您你抓起它，焦急地四下看看，好像在寻找地方把它藏起来。这时，您的眼睛看到——”","“For a jest, my prince, we did exchange garments.Then we stood before a mirror; and so alike were we that both said it seemed as if there had been no change made—yes, you remember that.Then you noticed that the soldier had hurt my hand—look! here it is, I cannot yet even write with it, the fingers are so stiff.At this your Highness sprang up, vowing vengeance upon that soldier, and ran towards the door—you passed a table—that thing you call the Seal lay on that table—you snatched it up and looked eagerly about, as if for a place to hide it—your eye caught sight of—”"
"“好了，这就够了！感谢仁慈的上帝！”破衣烂衫的王权索求者非常兴奋地喊道，“去吧，好心的圣约翰，在墙上挂的一件米兰尼斯盔甲里，你会找到御玺！”","“There, ’tis sufficient! —and the good God be thanked!” exclaimed the ragged claimant, in a mighty excitement.“Go, my good St. John—in an arm-piece of the Milanese armour that hangs on the wall, thou’lt find the Seal!”"
"“对，我的国王！对！”汤姆·坎蒂大声说，“现在，英格兰王权是您的了，这样更好，因为一个生来木讷的人很可能会滥用它！快去，圣约翰阁下，让您的双脚插上翅膀！”","“Right, my King! right!” cried Tom Canty; “NOW the sceptre of England is thine own; and it were better for him that would dispute it that he had been born dumb!Go, my Lord St. John, give thy feet wings!”"
"整个人群都站起来了，不安、担心和强烈的兴奋几乎让他们发疯了。地面和平台上的人们开始疯狂地交谈，发出震耳欲聋的嗡嗡声。有好一会儿，除了旁边的人在他耳朵里喊的，或他向旁边的人耳朵里喊的事情，谁都不知道任何事，没有听到任何事，也没有对任何事感兴趣。时间悄然流逝，没有人知道过了多久，没有人留心、注意。终于，房子里突然安静下来，同时，圣约翰出现在了平台上，手里高捧着御玺。接着他喊声冲天：","The whole assemblage was on its feet now, and well-nigh out of its mind with uneasiness, apprehension, and consuming excitement.On the floor and on the platform a deafening buzz of frantic conversation burst forth, and for some time nobody knew anything or heard anything or was interested in anything but what his neighbour was shouting into his ear, or he was shouting into his neighbour’s ear.Time—nobody knew how much of it—swept by unheeded and unnoted.At last a sudden hush fell upon the house, and in the same moment St. John appeared upon the platform, and held the Great Seal aloft in his hand.Then such a shout went up—"
"“真正的国王万岁！”","“Long live the true King!”"
"长达五分钟的欢呼声和乐器的击打声使空气颤动，如狂风暴雨般挥舞着的白手绢使空气变成白色。这当中站着一个破衣烂衫的家伙，这是英国最显赫的人物。他站在宽敞的平台的中央，高兴而自豪，国家重要朝臣们跪在他周围。","For five minutes the air quaked with shouts and the crash of musical instruments, and was white with a storm of waving handkerchiefs; and through it all a ragged lad, the most conspicuous figure in England, stood, flushed and happy and proud, in the centre of the spacious platform, with the great vassals of the kingdom kneeling around him."
"然后，大家起立，汤姆·坎蒂大声说：","Then all rose, and Tom Canty cried out—"
"“现在，啊，我的国王，拿回这些帝王的衣服，再把那些破衣烂衫给可怜的汤姆——您的仆人。”","“Now, O my King, take these regal garments back, and give poor Tom, thy servant, his shreds and remnants again.”"
"摄政大臣大声说道：","The Lord Protector spoke up—"
"“扒光这个小无赖，把他扔到伦敦塔里。”","“Let the small varlet be stripped and flung into the Tower.”"
"但是新国王——那个真正的国王，说道：","But the new King, the true King, said—"
"“我不会这么做。如果不是他，我还回不到我的王位上——任何人都不得伤害他。对于你，我的好舅舅，摄政大臣阁下，你这样做对这个可怜的家伙是忘恩负义，因为我听说他封你为公爵。”这话让摄政大臣脸红了。“可是他不是国王，因此，你的好头衔现在值什么呢？明天，你要通过他向我请求确认它，否则你就不是公爵，依然只是个伯爵。”","“I will not have it so.But for him I had not got my crown again—none shall lay a hand upon him to harm him.And as for thee, my good uncle, my Lord Protector, this conduct of thine is not grateful toward this poor lad, for I hear he hath made thee a duke”—the Protector blushed—“yet he was not a king; wherefore what is thy fine title worth now?To-morrow you shall sue to me, through him, for its confirmation, else no duke, but a simple earl, shalt thou remain.”"
"受到指责的萨默塞特公爵大人此时从前面往后退了一点儿。国王转向汤姆，友善地说：“我可怜的男孩，我自己都不记得把御玺放在哪儿了，你怎么会记得呢？”","Under this rebuke, his Grace the Duke of Somerset retired a little from the front for the moment.The King turned to Tom, and said kindly—“My poor boy, how was it that you could remember where I hid the Seal when I could not remember it myself?”"
"“啊，我的国王，这很容易，因为我用过很多天了。”","“Ah, my King, that was easy, since I used it divers days.”"
"“你用了它，却说不出它在哪里？”","“Used it—yet could not explain where it was?”"
"“我不知道他们想要的是这个。他们并没有描述它，陛下。”","“I did not know it was that they wanted.They did not describe it, your Majesty.”"
"“那么，你用它做什么了？”","“Then how used you it?”"
"红晕悄悄爬上了汤姆的脸颊，他垂下眼睛，沉默不语。","The red blood began to steal up into Tom’s cheeks, and he dropped his eyes and was silent."
"“说吧，善良的家伙，什么都别怕，”国王说，“你拿英格兰的国玺做什么？”","“Speak up, good lad, and fear nothing,” said the King.“How used you the Great Seal of England?”"
"汤姆结巴了一下，可怜兮兮，意识有些混乱，然后脱口而出：","Tom stammered a moment, in a pathetic confusion, then got it out—"
"“用来敲坚果！”","“To crack nuts with!”"
"可怜的孩子，随之而来的雪崩般的笑声几乎让他摔倒。可是，如果还有人对汤姆不是英格兰国王，却熟悉王室威严的场面这件事表示怀疑，那么这个回答就完全打消了他们的疑虑。","Poor child, the avalanche of laughter that greeted this nearly swept him off his feet.But if a doubt remained in any mind that Tom Canty was not the King of England and familiar with the august appurtenances of royalty, this reply disposed of it utterly."
"同时，华丽的加冕典礼长袍从汤姆的肩上脱下来，穿在了国王身上，国王的破衣烂衫完全被藏在了下面。然后，加冕仪式继续进行。为真正的国王施涂油礼，将王冠戴在他的头上。当加农大炮将此消息传到城里时，整个伦敦似乎都在掌声中震动。","Meantime the sumptuous robe of state had been removed from Tom’s shoulders to the King’s, whose rags were effectually hidden from sight under it.Then the coronation ceremonies were resumed; the true King was anointed and the crown set upon his head, whilst cannon thundered the news to the city, and all London seemed to rock with applause."

"被卷入伦敦桥的骚乱之前，迈尔斯·亨登就够好看的了，而他从骚乱中出来后，变得更好看了。他进去时只有一点点钱，出来时就身无分文了。扒手将他最后一点儿钱都偷走了。","Miles Hendon was picturesque enough before he got into the riot on London Bridge—he was more so when he got out of it.He had but little money when he got in, none at all when he got out.The pickpockets had stripped him of his last farthing."
"不过没关系，反正他找到了他的男孩。作为一个士兵，他没有随意地执行自己的任务，而是首先开始安排他的行动。","But no matter, so he found his boy.Being a soldier, he did not go at his task in a random way, but set to work, first of all, to arrange his campaign."
"这个男孩一定会去做什么呢？他一定会去哪里呢？啊，迈尔斯想到，他一定会去以前常去的地方，因为这是无家可归、孤苦伶仃、头脑不健全的人的本能，就连头脑健全的人也是一样。他以前的住处在哪里？他的破衣服，还有那个好像认识他、甚至声称是他父亲的粗俗的恶棍，都说明他的家在伦敦最贫穷、最低劣的这个或那个地区。找他会很难吗，花费的时间会很长吗？不，可能会既简单又短暂。他不需要找这个男孩，他要找的是一个群体。在一个或大或小的群体里，他迟早会找到他可怜的小朋友，肯定的。肮脏的暴徒可能正通过烦扰和激怒男孩来自娱自乐，他则会像往常一样声称自己是国王。接着，迈尔斯·亨登会打断其中几个人的腿，带走他的小受监护人，用爱的话语安慰他，让他高兴，这两个人将永远不再分开。","What would the boy naturally do?Where would he naturally go?Well—argued Miles—he would naturally go to his former haunts, for that is the instinct of unsound minds, when homeless and forsaken, as well as of sound ones.Whereabouts were his former haunts?His rags, taken together with the low villain who seemed to know him and who even claimed to be his father, indicated that his home was in one or another of the poorest and meanest districts of London.Would the search for him be difficult, or long?No, it was likely to be easy and brief.He would not hunt for the boy, he would hunt for a crowd; in the centre of a big crowd or a little one, sooner or later, he should find his poor little friend, sure; and the mangy mob would be entertaining itself with pestering and aggravating the boy, who would be proclaiming himself King, as usual.Then Miles Hendon would cripple some of those people, and carry off his little ward, and comfort and cheer him with loving words, and the two would never be separated any more."
"于是，迈尔斯开始了他的搜寻。一个小时又一个小时，他走在后巷和肮脏的街道上，寻找成群结伙的人。他发现了很多人群，可是连男孩的影子都没见到。这真是让他大为吃惊，但并没有使他泄气。他认为，问题不在于他的行动计划，只是时间计算有误——行动时间会很长，而他原以为很短。","So Miles started on his quest.Hour after hour he tramped through back alleys and squalid streets, seeking groups and crowds, and finding no end of them, but never any sign of the boy.This greatly surprised him, but did not discourage him.To his notion, there was nothing the matter with his plan of campaign; the only miscalculation about it was that the campaign was becoming a lengthy one, whereas he had expected it to be short."
"天终于放亮的时候，他已经走了好几英里路，细查了许多人群，但是唯一的结果是他非常疲倦，相当饥饿，而且十分困乏。他想吃点早餐，但是弄不到。为早餐而乞讨对他来说行不通。至于将他的剑典当，他会立刻想到丢失他的荣誉。他可以卖件自己的衣服——对，可是为这样的衣服找买主，就如同为疾病找买主一样困难。","When daylight arrived, at last, he had made many a mile, and canvassed many a crowd, but the only result was that he was tolerably tired, rather hungry and very sleepy.He wanted some breakfast, but there was no way to get it.To beg for it did not occur to him; as to pawning his sword, he would as soon have thought of parting with his honour; he could spare some of his clothes—yes, but one could as easily find a customer for a disease as for such clothes."
"时至中午，他仍在流浪。现在，他混在跟着皇家游行的乌合之众里面，因为他认为这帝王的表演会对他的小疯子产生强烈的吸引力。他跟着游行队伍迂回曲折地穿梭在伦敦城内，一直到了威斯敏斯特和这个大教堂。他在聚集在这里的人群中困惑而不知所措地走来走去，疲惫地走了好长时间，最后离开了，考虑着怎么尽力完善他的行动计划。渐渐地，当他从冥思苦想中清醒过来时，发现城市已经被远远抛在了身后，天色也渐晚了。他在靠近河流的郊区。这是一片富裕的郊区，并不欢迎穿得像他这样的人。","At noon he was still tramping—among the rabble which followed after the royal procession, now; for he argued that this regal display would attract his little lunatic powerfully.He followed the pageant through all its devious windings about London, and all the way to Westminster and the Abbey.He drifted here and there amongst the multitudes that were massed in the vicinity for a weary long time, baffled and perplexed, and finally wandered off, thinking, and trying to contrive some way to better his plan of campaign.By-and-by, when he came to himself out of his musings, he discovered that the town was far behind him and that the day was growing old.He was near the river, and in the country; it was a region of fine rural seats—not the sort of district to welcome clothes like his."
"天一点儿都不冷，所以他在树篱背风面的地上躺下，边休息边思考。不一会儿，睡意开始侵袭他的知觉。远处隐约的隆隆的炮声飘进他的耳朵里，他想着“新国王登基了”，然后立即睡着了。在此之前，他已经三十多个小时没有睡觉或休息了。直到第二天快到中午时，他才醒来。","It was not at all cold; so he stretched himself on the ground in the lee of a hedge to rest and think.Drowsiness presently began to settle upon his senses; the faint and far-off boom of cannon was wafted to his ear, and he said to himself, “The new King is crowned,” and straightway fell asleep.He had not slept or rested, before, for more than thirty hours.He did not wake again until near the middle of the next morning."
"他站起来，一瘸一拐，僵直呆板，饿得半死。他在河里洗了把脸，往胃里灌了一两品脱水，就开始向威斯敏斯特前进了，边走边喃喃自语，抱怨自己浪费了这么多时间。现在，因为饥饿，他有了新计划：他要努力找老汉弗莱·马洛先生说句话，借几个马克，还要——不过现在看来这个计划就够了，完成这第一步时，就会有足够的时间来扩展这个计划。　","He got up, lame, stiff, and half famished, washed himself in the river, stayed his stomach with a pint or two of water, and trudged off toward Westminster, grumbling at himself for having wasted so much time.Hunger helped him to a new plan, now; he would try to get speech with old Sir Humphrey Marlow and borrow a few marks, and—but that was enough of a plan for the present; it would be time enough to enlarge it when this first stage should be accomplished."
"将近十一点钟时，他来到了宫殿。尽管周围有很多光鲜的人群与他同路，但他还是很显眼——这都是他那衣服的功劳。他仔细看着这些人的脸，希望找到一个面善的人，可能愿意替他带话给老官员。至于自己试图进宫，那简直是不可能的。","Toward eleven o’clock he approached the palace; and although a host of showy people were about him, moving in the same direction, he was not inconspicuous—his costume took care of that.He watched these people’s faces narrowly, hoping to find a charitable one whose possessor might be willing to carry his name to the old lieutenant—as to trying to get into the palace himself, that was simply out of the question."
"这时，鞭童经过他身边，然后着他转，仔细看着这个人，心想：“如果这不是陛下十分担心的那个流浪者，那么我就是蠢蛋——虽然也许我以前是。他丝毫不差地符合描述——如果上帝创造两个这样的人，就是在浪费地用重复毁灭奇迹。我希望我能想出和他说话的理由。”","Presently our whipping-boy passed him, then wheeled about and scanned his figure well, saying to himself, “An’ that is not the very vagabond his Majesty is in such a worry about, then am I an ass—though belike I was that before.He answereth the description to a rag—that God should make two such would be to cheapen miracles by wasteful repetition.I would I could contrive an excuse to speak with him.”"
"迈尔斯·亨登为他省了麻烦，因为接着他转过头来，就像被后面的人死死地盯着看的人通常做的一样。看到男孩眼中强烈的兴趣，他走上前，对他说：","Miles Hendon saved him the trouble; for he turned about, then, as a man generally will when somebody mesmerises him by gazing hard at him from behind; and observing a strong interest in the boy’s eyes, he stepped toward him and said—"
"“你刚从宫殿里出来，你是那里的人吗？”","“You have just come out from the palace; do you belong there?”"
"“是的，阁下。”","“Yes, your worship.”"
"“你知道汉弗莱·马洛先生吗？”","“Know you Sir Humphrey Marlow?”"
"男孩吃了一惊，心想：“天啊！那是我早已去世的老父亲！”然后他大声回答道：“很熟悉，阁下。”","The boy started, and said to himself, “Lord! mine old departed father!”Then he answered aloud, “Right well, your worship.”"
"“太好了——他在里面吗？”","“Good—is he within?”"
"“是的，”男孩说，又在心里加上一句：“在他的坟墓里。”","“Yes,” said the boy; and added, to himself, “within his grave.”"
"“我可以请您帮忙向他通告一声，就说我请求跟他说句话吗？”","“Might I crave your favour to carry my name to him, and say I beg to say a word in his ear?”"
"“我会非常乐于做这件事，亲爱的先生。”“就说理查德先生的儿子迈尔斯·亨登在外面。我会对您感激不尽的，好心的小伙子。”男孩看起来有些失望。“国王说的名字不是这个，”他想，“不过没关系，这是他的双胞兄弟，我保证能作为“零碎先生”为陛下提供另一个消息。”所以他对迈尔斯说：“到那里去等一下，好心的先生，等我给你回话。”","“I will despatch the business right willingly, fair sir.”“Then say Miles Hendon, son of Sir Richard, is here without—I shall be greatly bounden to you, my good lad.”The boy looked disappointed.“The King did not name him so,” he said to himself; “but it mattereth not, this is his twin brother, and can give his Majesty news of t’other Sir-Odds-and-Ends, I warrant.”So he said to Miles, “Step in there a moment, good sir, and wait till I bring you word.”"
"亨登回到指定的地方，那是宫墙上用以休息的凹处，里面有个石凳。天气不好时，哨兵们就在这里躲雨。他刚坐下，几个戟兵突然护送着一名官员走过。官员看到他，叫他们停下，并叫亨登走过去。他照做了，却被当做潜进宫殿内的可疑人物而立即给抓了起来。事情开始变得不妙。可怜的迈尔斯正要解释，可是这个官员粗鲁地不让他说话，命令手下没收他的武器并对他搜身。","Hendon retired to the place indicated—it was a recess sunk in the palace wall, with a stone bench in it—a shelter for sentinels in bad weather.He had hardly seated himself when some halberdiers, in charge of an officer, passed by.The officer saw him, halted his men, and commanded Hendon to come forth.He obeyed, and was promptly arrested as a suspicious character prowling within the precincts of the palace.Things began to look ugly.Poor Miles was going to explain, but the officer roughly silenced him, and ordered his men to disarm him and search him."
"“仁慈的上帝保佑他们找到什么，”可怜的迈尔斯说，“我已经搜遍了，没找到东西，而我却比他们更需要找到东西呢。”","“God of his mercy grant that they find somewhat,” said poor Miles; “I have searched enow, and failed, yet is my need greater than theirs.”"
"除了一封信，什么都没找到。官员把信打开。当亨登认出这是在亨登庄园那倒霉的一天，他丢失的小朋友画的“没有意义、歪歪扭扭的文字”时，他笑了。这位官员读这段英文时，脸色变得暗黑。迈尔斯听着，脸色漂成了相反的颜色。","Nothing was found but a document.The officer tore it open, and Hendon smiled when he recognised the ‘pot-hooks’ made by his lost little friend that black day at Hendon Hall.The officer’s face grew dark as he read the English paragraph, and Miles blenched to the opposite colour as he listened."
"“又新来一个声称是国王的人！”这位官员叫道，“今天，他们真是像兔子一样繁殖。抓住这无赖，士兵们，我去将这封珍贵的信送给国王，这会儿，你们保证把他看好了。”","“Another new claimant of the Crown!” cried the officer.“Verily they breed like rabbits, to-day.Seize the rascal, men, and see ye keep him fast whilst I convey this precious paper within and send it to the King.”"
"他匆匆离去，留下囚犯在戟兵手里。","He hurried away, leaving the prisoner in the grip of the halberdiers."
"“现在，我的厄运终于要结束了，”亨登嘟囔着，“因为我一定会被吊在绳子上绞死，就是因为那封信。我可怜的伙伴怎么办呢！啊，只有仁慈的上帝知道。”","“Now is my evil luck ended at last,” muttered Hendon, “for I shall dangle at a rope’s end for a certainty, by reason of that bit of writing.And what will become of my poor lad! —ah, only the good God knoweth.”"
"不久，他看到这位官员又来了，脚步非常匆忙。所以他鼓足勇气，打算像男子汉一样来面对他的麻烦。这位官员命令士兵们松开囚犯，把剑还给他，然后尊敬地鞠了躬，说：","By-and-by he saw the officer coming again, in a great hurry; so he plucked his courage together, purposing to meet his trouble as became a man.The officer ordered the men to loose the prisoner and return his sword to him; then bowed respectfully, and said—"
"“请先生您跟我来。”","“Please you, sir, to follow me.”"
"亨登跟着，心想：“我不是去接受死刑和宣判，所以是要减轻罪行。如果不是这样，我就会杀死这个假惺惺的流氓。”","Hendon followed, saying to himself, “An’ I were not travelling to death and judgment, and so must needs economise in sin, I would throttle this knave for his mock courtesy.”"
"二人穿过人群拥挤的院子，来到了辉煌的宫殿入口处。在这里，这位官员再次鞠躬，将亨登交到一个优雅的官员手里。这位官员万分尊敬地接待了他，继续带着他穿过宏伟的大厅。大厅两边有两队穿着华丽的奴仆（二人走过时，他们鞠躬表示敬意，当他转过身时，他们却对我们庄严的衣衫褴褛的人使劲憋着笑，以免笑出声来）。他们走上一级宽敞的台阶，走进华丽的人群中，最后被引至一间大屋子里。英格兰贵族们为他让出一条路，然后鞠躬，这提醒他摘掉帽子。他被留在房间中央独自站着，成了所有眼睛的对象，成了许多愤愤不平的皱眉，以及很多消遣和讥笑的对象。","The two traversed a populous court, and arrived at the grand entrance of the palace, where the officer, with another bow, delivered Hendon into the hands of a gorgeous official, who received him with profound respect and led him forward through a great hall, lined on both sides with rows of splendid flunkeys (who made reverential obeisance as the two passed along, but fell into death-throes of silent laughter at our stately scarecrow the moment his back was turned), and up a broad staircase, among flocks of fine folk, and finally conducted him into a vast room, clove a passage for him through the assembled nobility of England, then made a bow, reminded him to take his hat off, and left him standing in the middle of the room, a mark for all eyes, for plenty of indignant frowns, and for a sufficiency of amused and derisive smiles."
"迈尔斯·亨登完全糊涂了。五步之外，在典礼的华盖下坐着年轻的国王。他朝一边低着头，正与一种天堂里的像人一样的鸟说话——那也许是一个公爵。亨登心想，即使不算上这种奇怪的当众侮辱，在正当年时被判处死罪已经够严酷了。他希望国王能快点结束它，因为旁边几个装扮浮华的人们变得非常无礼。这时，国王稍微抬了抬头，亨登看到了他整张脸。这一眼差点让他一口气没喘上来！他好像被钉在了那里，呆呆地看着这张美丽年轻的脸。过了一会儿，他突然说：","Miles Hendon was entirely bewildered.There sat the young King, under a canopy of state, five steps away, with his head bent down and aside, speaking with a sort of human bird of paradise—a duke, maybe.Hendon observed to himself that it was hard enough to be sentenced to death in the full vigour of life, without having this peculiarly public humiliation added.He wished the King would hurry about it—some of the gaudy people near by were becoming pretty offensive.At this moment the King raised his head slightly, and Hendon caught a good view of his face.The sight nearly took his breath away!—He stood gazing at the fair young face like one transfixed; then presently ejaculated—"
"“看，梦幻和影子王国的君主坐在宝座上！”","“Lo, the Lord of the Kingdom of Dreams and Shadows on his throne!”"
"他喃喃说了些不连贯的话，眼睛仍然凝视着，心中感到惊讶。然后，他转着眼睛四下里看，扫视美丽的人群和华丽的大厅，咕哝道：“但是这些是真的，这些确实是真的，肯定不是做梦。”","He muttered some broken sentences, still gazing and marvelling; then turned his eyes around and about, scanning the gorgeous throng and the splendid saloon, murmuring, “But these are real—verily these are real—surely it is not a dream.”"
"他又盯着国王看，心想：“这是个梦吗……还是他真的是英国国王，而不是我认为的无依无靠的、可怜的疯子汤姆——谁帮我解答这个谜？”","He stared at the King again—and thought, “is it a dream ... or is he the veritable Sovereign of England, and not the friendless poor Tom o’ Bedlam I took him for—who shall solve me this riddle?”"
"一个念头突然在他的眼睛里闪过——他走到墙边，抓起一把椅子，拿回原处，放在地上，然后坐在了上面！","A sudden idea flashed in his eye, and he strode to the wall, gathered up a chair, brought it back, planted it on the floor, and sat down in it!"
"立即出现了一阵义愤填膺的嗡嗡声，一只粗糙的手落在他身上，只听有声音大叫：","A buzz of indignation broke out, a rough hand was laid upon him and a voice exclaimed—"
"“起来，你这个没有礼貌的小丑！在国王面前，你能坐吗？”","“Up, thou mannerless clown!would’st sit in the presence of the King?”"
"骚动引起了国王的注意，他伸出手，大声说：","The disturbance attracted his Majesty’s attention, who stretched forth his hand and cried out—"
"“别动他，就是他！”","“Touch him not, it is his right!”"
"众人后退，呆若木鸡。国王继续说道：","The throng fell back, stupefied.The King went on—"
"“夫人、阁下和先生们，你们都听着，这是我信赖，而且非常喜爱的仆人迈尔斯·亨登，他举起他的利剑搭救王子，王子才免于身体的伤害,才死里逃生。因此，他是个骑士，这是国王钦赐的。听着，还有更高尚的事情：为了他的君王免于受到鞭打和屈辱，他自己代替他的君王承受了鞭打。他是英格兰贵族，肯特男爵，他将会拥有符合他的荣誉的黄金和领地。还有，他刚才所做的，是王室授予的特权，因为我们已经规定，他的家族直系将自此拥有在英格兰陛下面前坐下的权利，代代相传，只要王位还存在。不要妨碍他。”","“Learn ye all, ladies, lords, and gentlemen, that this is my trusty and well-beloved servant, Miles Hendon, who interposed his good sword and saved his prince from bodily harm and possible death—and for this he is a knight, by the King’s voice.Also learn, that for a higher service, in that he saved his sovereign stripes and shame, taking these upon himself, he is a peer of England, Earl of Kent, and shall have gold and lands meet for the dignity.More—the privilege which he hath just exercised is his by royal grant; for we have ordained that the chiefs of his line shall have and hold the right to sit in the presence of the Majesty of England henceforth, age after age, so long as the crown shall endure.Molest him not.”"
"因为耽误了时间，从乡下来的两个人今天早上才到达这里，现在在房间刚呆了五分钟，站着听了这些话，看着国王，又看看这个衣衫褴褛之人，又看看国王，都有些迟钝而困惑。他们是休先生和伊迪丝小姐。可是新男爵没看到他们。他仍旧在恍恍惚惚地盯着君主，嘴里咕哝着：","Two persons, who, through delay, had only arrived from the country during this morning, and had now been in this room only five minutes, stood listening to these words and looking at the King, then at the scarecrow, then at the King again, in a sort of torpid bewilderment.These were Sir Hugh and the Lady Edith.But the new Earl did not see them.He was still staring at the monarch, in a dazed way, and muttering—"
"“噢，天啊！这是我的贫儿！这是我的疯子！这是他，我朝他炫耀过我那有七十间房和二十七个仆人的住宅有多么宏伟！这是他，除了破衣烂衫，踢两下是为了安慰，吃的只有剩饭之外，他什么也不知道！这是他，我收养了他，想让他体面！上帝，我希望有个袋子把我的头藏起来！”","“Oh, body o’ me!THIS my pauper!This my lunatic!This is he whom – I – would show what grandeur was, in my house of seventy rooms and seven-and-twenty servants!This is he who had never known aught but rags for raiment, kicks for comfort, and offal for diet!This is he whom – I – adopted and would make respectable!Would God I had a bag to hide my head in!”"
"然后，他忽然又变得有礼貌了。他双膝跪下，双手放在国王的双手中间，发誓效忠并对赐予他的土地和头衔表示敬意。然后他起身，谦恭地站到一边，但他仍旧是大家注视的对象，也是人们非常羡慕的对象。","Then his manners suddenly came back to him, and he dropped upon his knees, with his hands between the King’s, and swore allegiance and did homage for his lands and titles.Then he rose and stood respectfully aside, a mark still for all eyes—and much envy, too."
"这时，国王发现了休先生，便眼睛发亮、怒气冲冲地说道：","Now the King discovered Sir Hugh, and spoke out with wrathful voice and kindling eye—"
"“撕掉这个强盗的面具，拿回被他偷取的房产，将他牢牢地锁起来，直到我需要他为止。”","“Strip this robber of his false show and stolen estates, and put him under lock and key till I have need of him.”"
"迟到的休先生被拖走了。","The late Sir Hugh was led away."
"现在，房间另一端出现了骚动。众人让开，穿着优雅而华丽的汤姆·坎蒂由引座员领着，从人墙中间走上前来。他跪在国王前面，国王说道：","There was a stir at the other end of the room, now; the assemblage fell apart, and Tom Canty, quaintly but richly clothed, marched down, between these living walls, preceded by an usher.He knelt before the King, who said—"
"“我已经知道过去几个星期所发生的事情，我对你非常满意。你用恰当的皇室的温柔和仁慈统治这个王国。你又找到了你的母亲和姐姐了吗？好，她们将得到恩泽，而你的父亲将被处以绞刑——如果你想这样的话，法律允许。能听到我说话的所有人要知道，从今天开始，那些居住在基督医院收容所、享受国王抚恤金的人，要充实他们的头脑和心灵，满足他们基本的需求。这个男孩将终生住在那儿，担任尊敬的管理队伍的长官。而且，因为他曾经做过国王，一般的形象肯定不适合他，因此，这将成为他的国服，人们看到国服就能认出他，而且不许任何人仿制。不管他从哪里来，它将提醒人们他一生中曾经做过国王，人人都要给他应得的尊敬，向他致敬。他拥有王位的保护，他拥有王冠的支持，他将被授予光荣的国王守卫的头衔。”","“I have learned the story of these past few weeks, and am well pleased with thee.Thou hast governed the realm with right royal gentleness and mercy.Thou hast found thy mother and thy sisters again?Good; they shall be cared for—and thy father shall hang, if thou desire it and the law consent.Know, all ye that hear my voice, that from this day, they that abide in the shelter of Christ’s Hospital and share the King’s bounty shall have their minds and hearts fed, as well as their baser parts; and this boy shall dwell there, and hold the chief place in its honourable body of governors, during life.And for that he hath been a king, it is meet that other than common observance shall be his due; wherefore note this his dress of state, for by it he shall be known, and none shall copy it; and wheresoever he shall come, it shall remind the people that he hath been royal, in his time, and none shall deny him his due of reverence or fail to give him salutation.He hath the throne’s protection, he hath the crown’s support, he shall be known and called by the honourable title of the King’s Ward.”"
"自豪而高兴的汤姆·坎蒂站起来，亲吻国王的手，然后有人引他离开。他迫不及待地跑到他母亲身边，把这件事告诉她和娜恩还有贝特，让她们与他分享这重大的好消息。","The proud and happy Tom Canty rose and kissed the King’s hand, and was conducted from the presence.He did not waste any time, but flew to his mother, to tell her and Nan and Bet all about it and get them to help him enjoy the great news."
