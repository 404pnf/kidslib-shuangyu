"第一章 枪炮俱乐部","CHAPTER I THE GUN CLUB"
"美国内战期间，马里兰州的巴尔的摩市出现了一个很有影响力的新俱乐部。大家都知道那些船东、店主，还有机械师对军事的爱好是如何时兴起来的。很多普通的商人，放弃经商，摇身一变成为上尉、上校，甚至将军，而他们从没读过西点军校的指挥学院。不过他们很快就和旧大陆的那些同行们旗鼓相当了，而且还像他们一样靠着大量的枪炮弹药，靠着无度地挥霍金钱，靠着牺牲大量的士兵打了几次胜仗。","During the War of the Rebellion, a new and influential club was established in the city of Baltimore in the State of Maryland.It is well known with what energy the taste for military matters became developed among that nation of ship-owners, shopkeepers, and mechanics.Simple tradesmen jumped their counters to become extemporized captains, colonels, and generals without having ever passed the School of Instruction at West Point; nevertheless; they quickly rivaled their compeers of the old continent, and, like them, carried off victories by dint of lavish expenditure in ammunition, money ,and men."
"但是美国人远超于欧洲人的，是在枪炮制造技术方面。这倒也不是说他们的武器就比别人的精良，而是他们制造的枪炮尺寸空前，因而射程空前。在擦地射击、俯射、斜射、纵射、近距平射等方面，英国人、法国人，还有普鲁士人已经没什么可再学的了，但他们的大炮、榴弹炮、迫击炮跟美国威力强大的火炮相比，就只是袖珍手枪了。","But the point in which the Americans singularly distanced the Europeans was in the science of gunnery.Not, indeed, that their weapons retained a higher degree of perfection than theirs, but that they exhibited unheard-of dimensions, and consequently attained hitherto unheard-of ranges.In point of grazing, plunging, oblique, or enfilading, or point-blank firing, the English, French, and Prussians have nothing to learn; but their cannon, howitzers, and mortars are mere pocket-pistols compared with the formidable engines of the American artillery."
"其实人们也不用大惊小怪。美国佬是世界上第一批机械专家，他们天生就是做工程师的材料——就像意大利人天生就是音乐家，德国人天生就是玄学家一样。因此他们把这份创新天赋用到枪炮制造技术上，简直是再自然不过了。瞧瞧帕罗特、达尔格伦和罗德曼的杰作。阿姆斯特朗、帕利瑟，还有博利厄这些欧洲的枪炮专家们被迫在他们的美国对手面前低头。","This fact need surprise no one.The Yankees, the first mechanicians in the world, are engineers— just as the Italians are musicians and the Germans metaphysicians— by right of birth.Nothing is more natural, therefore, than to perceive them applying their audacious ingenuity to the science of gunnery.Witness the marvels of Parrott, Dahlgren, and Rodman.The Armstrong, Palliser, and Beaulieu guns were compelled to bow before their transatlantic rivals."
"如果有个美国人想出了好主意，他马上就会寻找另一个美国人与之分享。如果有三个人，他们就会从中选一个主席，其他两人做秘书。假如有四个人，他们就会指派一人负责档案管理，这样他们的办事处就万事俱备了，要是有五个人，他们就会召开全体会议，成立一个完备的俱乐部。在巴尔的摩，事情就是这样处理的。一种新型大炮的发明者就是与铸造工和钻孔工协同合作的。这样，所谓的“枪炮俱乐部”的核心就形成了。成立仅一个月，俱乐部就吸收了1,833名正式会员，30,565名通讯会员。","Now when an American has an idea, he directly seeks a second American to share it.If there be three, they elect a president and two secretaries.Given four, they name a keeper of records, and the office is ready for work; five, they convene a general meeting, and the club is fully constituted.So things were managed in Baltimore.The inventor of a new cannon associated himself with the caster and the borer.Thus was formed the nucleus of the “Gun Club.” In a single month after its formation it numbered 1,833 effective members and 30,565 corresponding members."
"每一个想参加该组织的人都必须具备一个条件，那就是他必须已经设计过、或（或多或少）改良过一种大炮，就算不是大炮，至少也得是某种其他类型的枪炮。不过，需要事先说明一下，仅仅发明左轮手枪、卡宾火枪和一些类似的小型武器的人，是得不到重视的。而大炮专家一向最得宠。","One condition was imposed as a sine qua non upon every candidate for admission into the association, and that was the condition of having designed, or (more or less) perfected a cannon; or, in default of a cannon, at least a firearm of some description.It may, however, be mentioned that mere inventors of revolvers, fire-shooting carbines, and similar small arms, met with little consideration.Artillerists always commanded the chief place of favor."
"正如枪炮俱乐部最严谨的发言人所云，俱乐部会员的受尊重程度“与他们发明的枪炮体积成正比，与他们枪炮射程的平方成正比。”","The estimation in which these gentlemen were held, according to one of the most scientific exponents of the Gun Club, was “proportional to the masses of their guns, and in the direct ratio of the square of the distances attained by their projectiles.”"
"枪炮俱乐部一成立，美国人的发明天赋会带来什么样的结果就可想而知了。他们的军事武器体积庞大，炮弹会飞出规定的界限，偶尔把一些无辜的路人炸为两段。实际上，这些大炮已经把欧洲那些寒碜的火炮远远抛在后面了。","The Gun Club once founded, it is easy to conceive the result of the inventive genius of the Americans.Their military weapons attained colossal proportions, and their projectiles, exceeding the prescribed limits, unfortunately occasionally cut in two some unoffending pedestrians.These inventions, in fact, left far in the rear the timid instruments of European artillery."
"还要说明的是，这些美国佬正如他们自己所证明的那样勇敢，从来不受理论与规则的约束，可是这样一来，他们也为自己的发明付出了沉重的代价。俱乐部内各个级别的军官都有，小到中尉，大到将军；多大岁数的军人都有，有刚刚从事军人职业的新兵，也有握了半辈子枪上了年纪的老兵。他们当中有很多已经长眠沙场，他们的名字被载入了枪炮俱乐部的“光荣簿”；大多有幸生还的人身上也留下了种种烙印，述说着他们无可辩驳的勇猛。这些生还的人们当中，随处可见拄拐的，安木头假肢、假胳膊、钢制钩状假手的，装橡胶下巴、银头盖骨、白金鼻子的。伟大的统计学家皮特凯恩曾计算过，在整个枪炮俱乐部中，平均四个人都分不到一只完整的胳膊，六个人中也找不到两条好腿。","It is but fair to add that these Yankees, brave as they have ever proved themselves to be, did not confine themselves to theories and formulae, but that they paid heavily, in propria persona, for their inventions.Among them were to be counted officers of all ranks, from lieutenants to generals; military men of every age, from those who were just making their debut in the profession of arms up to those who had grown old in the gun-carriage.Many had found their rest on the field of battle whose names figured in the “Book of Honor” of the Gun Club; and of those who made good their return the greater proportion bore the marks of their indisputable valor.Crutches, wooden legs, artificial arms, steel hooks, caoutchouc jaws, silver craniums, platinum noses, were all to be found in the collection; and it was calculated by the great statistician Pitcairn that throughout the Gun Club there was not quite one arm between four persons and two legs between six."
"然而，这些英勇的大炮专家们却对此全然不顾，当军情急件报告伤亡人数是所消耗的炮弹数的十倍时，他们都觉得自己有充分理由感到自豪。","Nevertheless, these valiant artillerists took no particular account of these little facts, and felt justly proud when the despatches of a battle returned the number of victims at ten-fold the quantity of projectiles expended."
"然而有一天——那是非常令人悲哀的一天！——战争的幸存者们签署了和平协定，雷鸣般的枪炮声渐渐停止，迫击炮沉默了，榴弹炮也无限期变成了哑巴，机关炮也放下炮筒，被运回了军械库，炮弹堆积如山，所有血腥的回忆都渐渐消退。棉花在肥沃的田间枝繁叶茂地生长，所有丧服都收起来了，悲痛也随之消失。枪炮俱乐部一下子无事可做了。","One day, however— sad and melancholy day!— peace was signed between the survivors of the war; the thunder of the guns gradually ceased, the mortars were silent, the howitzers were muzzled for an indefinite period, the cannon, with muzzles depressed, were returned into the arsenal, the shot were repiled, all bloody reminiscences were effaced; the cotton-plants grew luxuriantly in the well-manured fields, all mourning garments were laid aside, together with grief; and the Gun Club was relegated to profound inactivity."
"有一些水平较高、沉迷于制造大炮的理论家，仍在孜孜不倦地演算着炮弹投射的规律。他们一如既往地研究巨型炮弹和口径空前大的榴弹炮。但是缺少了实践，纯粹的理论又有什么价值呢？结果，俱乐部活动室变得冷冷清清，服务员在前厅里打盹，桌上的报纸都发了霉，黑暗的角落里不时传来鼾声。以往在大会上大声吵闹的俱乐部会员们，也变得沉默不语，因为如今的和平对他们来说简直是一场灾难，他们只能彻底沉浸在对大炮柏拉图式的憧憬当中。","Some few of the more advanced and inveterate theorists set themselves again to work upon calculations regarding the laws of projectiles.They reverted invariably to gigantic shells and howitzers of unparalleled caliber.Still in default of practical experience what was the value of mere theories?Consequently, the clubrooms became deserted, the servants dozed in the antechambers, the newspapers grew mouldy on the tables, sounds of snoring came from dark corners, and the members of the Gun Club, erstwhile so noisy in their seances, were reduced to silence by this disastrous peace and gave themselves up wholly to dreams of a Platonic kind of artillery."
"“这太可怕了！”一天傍晚汤姆·亨特在吸烟室里说，他的木头腿险些被壁炉烤焦；“无事可做！无所期待！多么令人憎恶的生活！什么时候我们早晨能再被动听的枪炮声叫醒啊？“","“This is horrible!” said Tom Hunter one evening, while rapidly carbonizing his wooden legs in the fireplace of the smoking-room; “nothing to do! nothing to look forward to! what a loathsome existence!When again shall the guns arouse us in the morning with their delightful reports?”"
"“那样的日子一去不复返喽。”快乐的倍尔斯贝一边说，一边试着抻抻他残缺的胳膊，“从前多快乐啊！如果有人发明了一种大炮，铸造出来以后马上就可以在敌人身上实验！然后这个人回到营地，就会听到舍曼的鼓励，或者能捞着和麦克莱伦进行一次友好的握手。可如今，那些将军们都已回到柜台前；他们不再发射炮弹，而是发送起棉花捆来。天啊，美国的枪炮制造没有前途了！”","“Those days are gone by,” said jolly Bilsby, trying to extend his missing arms.“It was delightful once upon a time!One invented a gun, and hardly was it cast, when one hastened to try it in the face of the enemy!Then one returned to camp with a word of encouragement from Sherman or a friendly shake of the hand from McClellan.But now the generals are gone back to their counters; and in place of projectiles, they despatch bales of cotton.By Jove, the future of gunnery in America is lost!”"
"“唉！再也盼不来战争了！”著名的詹姆斯·T.马斯顿接着说道，边说边用他的钢制钩状假手挠着杜仲胶做的假脑壳，再也盼不来战争了！”著名的詹姆斯·T. 马斯顿接着说道，边说边用他的钢制钩状假手挠着杜仲胶做的假脑壳，“毫无迹象！在大炮制造技术发展的关键时期，竟毫无迹象表明要有战争！可不是吗，先生们！跟你们说，就在今天早上，我刚刚完善了一个迫击炮模型（包括平面图、截面图、正面图等等）。它注定会扭转战争的整个局势！”","“Ay! and no war in prospect!” continued the famous James T. Maston, scratching with his steel hook his gutta-percha cranium.“Not a cloud on the horizon! and that too at such a critical period in the progress of the science of artillery!Yes, gentlemen!I who address you have myself this very morning perfected a model (plan, section, elevation, etc.) of a mortar destined to change all the conditions of warfare!”"
"“不！这可能吗？”汤姆·亨特回答道。他不由得想起了这位阁下之前的一个发明。","“No! is it possible?” replied Tom Hunter, his thoughts reverting involuntarily to a former invention of the Hon."
"J. T. 马斯顿当时发明了一种大炮，第一次实验就炸死了337个人。","J. T. Maston, by which, at its first trial, he had succeeded in killing three hundred and thirty-seven people."
"“的确如此！”他说，“但是，搞这么多试验，克服这么多困难有什么用？纯粹是在浪费时间！新世界里的人们好像铁了心要过和平的生活；不过，我们好战的《论坛报》预言由于人口恶性增长，一场灾难即将来临。”","“Fact!” replied he.“Still, what is the use of so many studies worked out, so many difficulties vanquished?It’s mere waste of time!The New World seems to have made up its mind to live in peace; and our bellicose Tribune predicts some approaching catastrophes arising out of this scandalous increase of population.”"
"“然而，”布鲁姆斯伯里上校说道，“在欧洲，人们一直在为维持民族原则而斗争。”","“Nevertheless,” replied Colonel Blomsberry, “they are always struggling in Europe to maintain the principle of nationalities.”"
"“那又怎么样？”","“Well?”"
"“唔，那里或许有生意可做；如果他们愿意接受我们的帮助——”","“Well, there might be some field for enterprise down there; and if they would accept our services——”"
"“你这是在做什么梦呀？”倍尔斯贝尖叫道；“为外国人造大炮，让他们受益？”","“What are you dreaming of?” screamed Bilsby; “work at gunnery for the benefit of foreigners?”"
"“总比在这里无事可做强吧。”上校反驳说。","“That would be better than doing nothing here,” returned the colonel."
"“理是这么个理，”J. T. 梅特森说；“但是，我们也没必要想出那样的权宜之计。”","“Quite so,” said J. T. Matson; “but still we need not dream of that expedient.”"
"“为什么不呢？”上校问道。","“And why not?” demanded the colonel."
"“因为在他们那种旧世界里，人们的发展观与我们美国人的思维习惯相反。那帮家伙认为不从少尉干起就当不了将军；就好比没造过枪的人就不会瞄准！”","“Because their ideas of progress in the Old World are contrary to our American habits of thought.Those fellows believe that one can’t become a general without having served first as an ensign; which is as much as to say that one can’t point a gun without having first cast it oneself!”"
"“荒唐！”汤姆·亨特说道，他正在用一把博伊刀削他坐着的安乐椅的扶手；“不过，如果那里的情形真是那样的话，那我们所能做的也只有种种烟草，炼炼鲸油了。“","“Ridiculous!” replied Tom Hunter, whittling with his bowie-knife the arms of his easy chair; “but if that be the case there, all that is left for us is to plant tobacco and distill whale-oil.”"
"“什么！”J. T. 马斯顿吼道，“难道我们的余生再没有机会改进枪炮了吗？我们再也没有机会去研究炮弹的射程了吗？天空再也不会被我们制造的枪炮点亮了吗？再也不会出现国际争端，给我们一个向大洋彼岸的某国宣战的理由了吗？难道法国人就不能击沉我们的火轮，英国人就不能无视国家权限，绞死我们几个同胞吗？”","“What!” roared J. T. Maston, “shall we not employ these remaining years of our life in perfecting firearms?Shall there never be a fresh opportunity of trying the ranges of projectiles?Shall the air never again be lighted with the glare of our guns?No international difficulty ever arise to enable us to declare war against some transatlantic power?Shall not the French sink one of our steamers, or the English, in defiance of the rights of nations, hang a few of our countrymen?”"
"“没这样的好运气，”布鲁姆斯伯里上校说，“不可能发生这种事；而且即使发生了，我们也不应该从这种事中获利。美国人的激情正在迅速减退，我们都在走向毁灭。”","“No such luck,” replied Colonel Blomsberry; “nothing of the kind is likely to happen; and even if it did, we should not profit by it.American susceptibility is fast declining, and we are all going to the dogs.”"
"“你说得太对了，”J. T. 马斯顿开始有些激动了，“有一千个理由打仗，可我们就是不打。我们为了国家的利益留着胳膊腿，可国家不知道用它们来做什么！不过等等——不用特地寻找战争理由——难道美国北部以前不是属于英国人的吗？”","“It is too true,” replied J. T. Maston, with fresh violence; “there are a thousand grounds for fighting, and yet we don’t fight.We save up our arms and legs for the benefit of nations who don’t know what to do with them!But stop—without going out of one’s way to find a cause for war—did not North America once belong to the English?”"
"“毫无疑问。”汤姆·亨特边说边愤怒地戳着他的拐杖。","“Undoubtedly,” replied Tom Hunter, stamping his crutch with fury."
"“那么，”J. T. 马斯顿接着说道，“为什么不该轮到英国属于我们美国人呢？”","“Well, then,” replied J. T. Maston, “why should not England in her turn belong to the Americans?”"
"“这才合理，才公平。”布鲁姆斯伯里上校答道。","“It would be but just and fair,” returned Colonel Blomsberry."
"“去向美国总统建议，”J. T. 马斯顿大声嚷道，“看看总统如何接待你。”","“Go and propose it to the President of the United States,” cried J. T. Maston, “and see how he will receive you.”"
"“呸！”倍里斯贝从战争中仅存的四颗牙中间挤出一句话，“不管用的！“","“Bah!” growled Bilsby between the four teeth which the war had left him; “that will never do!”"
"“天啊！”J. T. 马斯顿大声叫道，”下次选举他不要指望我投他的票啦！“","“By Jove!” cried J. T. Maston, “he mustn’t count on my vote at the next election!”"
"“也不要指望我们了。”所有残废的好战分子异口同声地答道。","“Nor on ours,” replied unanimously all the bellicose invalids."
"“与此同时，”J. T. 马斯顿接着说，”请允许我这样说：如果我再没有机会在真正的战场上试验我新设计的迫击炮，我将告别所有的枪炮俱乐部成员，去阿肯色州，把自己葬在那里的大草原上算了！“","“Meanwhile,” replied J. T. Maston, “allow me to say that, if I cannot get an opportunity to try my new mortars on a real field of battle, I shall say good-by to the members of the Gun Club, and go and bury myself in the prairies of Arkansas!”"
"“如果那样的话，我们都去陪你。”其他人嚷道。","“In that case we will accompany you,” cried the others."
"事态不容乐观，俱乐部面临着解散的威胁。就在这关键时刻，一件意想不到的事情发生了，阻止了这场不幸的灾难。","Matters were in this unfortunate condition, and the club was threatened with approaching dissolution, when an unexpected circumstance occurred to prevent so deplorable a catastrophe."
"就在这场谈话的次日，俱乐部每个成员都收到了一份密封的通知，内容如下：","On the morrow after this conversation every member of the association received a sealed circular couched in the following terms:"
"巴尔的摩，十月三日。枪炮俱乐部的主席荣幸地通知他的每一位同仁，在本月五日的会议上，他将给大家带来一个非常有趣的消息。因此，他要求会员们接受这次邀请，安排好自己的时间，届时方便参会。诚挚地，英庇·巴比康，P. G. C.","BALTIMORE, October 3.The president of the Gun Club has the honor to inform his colleagues that, at the meeting of the 5th instant, he will bring before them a communication of an extremely interesting nature.He requests, therefore, that they will make it convenient to attend in accordance with the present invitation.Very cordially, IMPEY BARBICANE, P.G.C."
"第二章 巴比康主席的报告","CHAPTER II PRESIDENT BARBICANE’S COMMUNICATION"
"十月五日晚八时，密密麻麻的人群涌向了枪炮俱乐部的所在地——联邦广场二十一号大厅。居住在巴尔的摩的所有会员都应主席之邀参加了这次会议。至于那些通讯会员，他们都看到了散发的通知，那些通知足有上千张，遍布了城市的大街小巷。所以，尽管会议厅很大，还是无法容纳大批涌来的专家。会员们涌到了隔壁的几个大厅，占满了狭窄的通道，一直挤到外面的院子里。在那里，他们和拥堵在门口的普通市民们一起挤来挤去，每个人都怀着渴望的心情试图挤到前排去，聆听巴比康主席这次重要的报告。他们推呀，挤呀，撞呀，表现出“自治”观念教育下的群众所特有的那种绝对行动自由。","On the 5th of October, at eight p.m., a dense crowd pressed toward the saloons of the Gun Club at No.21 Union Square.All the members of the association resident in Baltimore attended the invitation of their president.As regards the corresponding members, notices were delivered by hundreds throughout the streets of the city, and, large as was the great hall, it was quite inadequate to accommodate the crowd of savants.They overflowed into the adjoining rooms, down the narrow passages, into the outer courtyards.There they ran against the vulgar herd who pressed up to the doors, each struggling to reach the front ranks, all eager to learn the nature of the important communication of President Barbicane; all pushing, squeezing, crushing with that perfect freedom of action which is so peculiar to the masses when educated in ideas of “self-government.”"
"那天晚上，一个暂居巴尔的摩的外地人无论如何也不会被获准进入大厅。大厅是专门为本地会员和通讯会员准备的，除了他们，谁也不能在大厅内就座，就连本市的名流、议员和市政管理委员会成员，为了捕捉到一点点内部消息，都不得不和那些普通市民混在一起。","On that evening a stranger who might have chanced to be in Baltimore could not have gained admission for love or money into the great hall.That was reserved exclusively for resident or corresponding members; no one else could possibly have obtained a place; and the city magnates, municipal councilors, and “select men” were compelled to mingle with the mere townspeople in order to catch stray bits of news from the interior."
"不过，这宽敞的大厅的确是一个奇观。宽大的会场和它的用途非常相称。高大的柱子由大炮构成，这些大炮层层叠叠摞在巨大的迫击炮组成的柱基上，支撑着一座精致的、雕有铸铁花边的拱形铁架。墙上陈列着很多战利品，有老式的大口径短枪、火绳枪、老式火绳枪、卡宾枪等各种各样古代和现代的武器，这些武器交错着陈列在墙上，组成了一幅别致的图画。明亮的煤气灯照在无数只左轮手枪上，闪烁出耀眼的光芒；一簇簇手枪，还有由滑膛枪捆成的大枝形烛台，使得整座大厅更加熠熠生辉。大炮模型、青铜铸件、坑坑洼洼的瞄准具、被枪炮俱乐部炸坏的钢板、各式各样的推弹器和炮刷、一串串念珠似的弹壳、一盘盘项链似的子弹，还有一圈圈花环似的榴弹——总而言之，炮术家们的全套装备都被巧妙地摆放在大厅里，让你觉得它们是用来装饰的，而不是用来杀人的。","Nevertheless the vast hall presented a curious spectacle.Its immense area was singularly adapted to the purpose.Lofty pillars formed of cannon, superposed upon huge mortars as a base, supported the fine ironwork of the arches, a perfect piece of cast-iron lacework.Trophies of blunderbuses, matchlocks, arquebuses, carbines, all kinds of firearms, ancient and modern, were picturesquely interlaced against the walls.The gas lit up in full glare myriads of revolvers grouped in the form of lustres, while groups of pistols, and candelabra formed of muskets bound together, completed this magnificent display of brilliance.Models of cannon, bronze castings, sights covered with dents, plates battered by the shots of the Gun Club, assortments of rammers and sponges, chaplets of shells, wreaths of projectiles, garlands of howitzers—in short, all the apparatus of the artillerist, enchanted the eye by this wonderful arrangement and induced a kind of belief that their real purpose was ornamental rather than deadly."
"大厅尽头一座宽阔的平台上，坐着巴比康主席和他的四位秘书。他的椅子装在一座雕花的炮架上，整个椅身按32英寸的迫击炮仿制而成，显得十分笨重。椅身与炮架形成一个90度角，并悬吊在横杆上。这样，巴比康主席就能像坐摇椅一样前后晃动，在如此炎热的天气里，这的确是件令人愉快的事。在这张桌子（一张由六座臼炮支撑的大铁板）上，摆着一只精雕细琢的西班牙墨水台，还有一只小铃，能发出左轮手枪般的爆炸声。辩论激烈的时候，这只新奇的小铃就会响起来，勉强可以压过那些易怒的炮术家们的喧哗。","At the further end of the saloon the president, assisted by four secretaries, occupied a large platform.His chair, supported by a carved gun-carriage, was modeled upon the ponderous proportions of a 32-inch mortar.It was pointed at an angle of ninety degrees, and suspended upon truncheons, so that the president could balance himself upon it as upon a rocking-chair, a very agreeable fact in the very hot weather.Upon the table (a huge iron plate supported upon six carronades) stood an inkstand of exquisite elegance, made of a beautifully chased Spanish piece, and a sonnette, which, when required, could give forth a report equal to that of a revolver.During violent debates this novel kind of bell scarcely sufficed to drown the clamor of these excitable artillerists."
"桌子前面，一条条长凳像堡垒的围墙似的排成之字形，宛如绵延的棱堡和屏障，以便枪炮俱乐部的会员在此集会，而这个特别的夜晚，可以说“壁垒上兵将如云”。不过，大家对巴比康主席有着充分的了解，确信他如果没有什么充足的理由，是不会惊动他的会员们的。","In front of the table benches arranged in zigzag form, like the circumvallations of a retrenchment, formed a succession of bastions and curtains set apart for the use of the members of the club; and on this especial evening one might say, “All the world was on the ramparts.” The president was sufficiently well known, however, for all to be assured that he would not put his colleagues to discomfort without some very strong motive."
"英庇·巴比康已经四十岁了，他沉着、冷静、一丝不苟，举止十分严肃持重，像精密计时器一样守时，性情沉稳，意志坚定。他虽不是个骑士，却如骑士一样酷爱冒险，即使面对最棘手的事情，也会坚持实事求是的态度。他是纯正的新英格兰人，一个来自北方的殖民主义者，是斯图亚特王朝的敌对势力——园颅党——的后裔，南方绅士——母国过去的骑士们——的不共戴天之敌。总而言之，他是一个彻头彻尾的美国北方佬。","Impey Barbicane was a man of forty years of age, calm, cold, austere; of a singularly serious and self-contained demeanor, punctual as a chronometer, of imperturbable temper and immovable character; by no means chivalrous, yet adventurous withal, and always bringing practical ideas to bear upon the very rashest enterprises; an essentially New Englander, a Northern colonist, a descendant of the old anti-Stuart Roundheads, and the implacable enemy of the gentlemen of the South, those ancient cavaliers of the mother country.In a word, he was a Yankee to the backbone."
"巴比康早年做木材生意，发了大财。战争时期，作为炮兵部队的指挥官，他向人们证明了自己是一位多产的发明家。他的大胆构想，使他的发明为大炮技术的发展作出了重大贡献，同时，也大大推进了对大炮的实验研究。","Barbicane had made a large fortune as a timber merchant.Being nominated director of artillery during the war, he proved himself fertile in invention.Bold in his conceptions, he contributed powerfully to the progress of that arm and gave an immense impetus to experimental researches."
"他中等身材，四肢健全，这在枪炮俱乐部里是一个罕见的例外。他棱角分明的容貌，仿佛是用直尺和丁字尺勾勒出来的。如果说要判断一个人性格就必须观察他的外貌，那么从巴比康的面部轮廓来看，他所展现出的品质无疑是精力充沛、英勇无畏和沉着冷静的。","He was personage of the middle height, having, by a rare exception in the Gun Club, all his limbs complete.His strongly marked features seemed drawn by square and rule; and if it be true that, in order to judge a man’s character one must look at his profile, Barbicane, so examined, exhibited the most certain indications of energy, audacity, and sang-froid."
"而此时，他正默默地坐在扶椅上，躲在美国人常戴的那种圆筒形黑缎子礼帽下面，全神贯注地思索着什么。","At this moment he was sitting in his armchair, silent, absorbed, lost in reflection, sheltered under his high-crowned hat— a kind of black cylinder which always seems firmly screwed upon the head of an American."
"当大厅里的时钟指向八点，低沉的钟声响起时，巴比康像是被一根弹簧弹了起来，猛地站起身，会场随即变得鸦雀无声。他用略带强调的语气说道：","Just when the deep-toned clock in the great hall struck eight, Barbicane, as if he had been set in motion by a spring, raised himself up. A profound silence ensued, and the speaker, in a somewhat emphatic tone of voice, commenced as follows:"
"“我勇敢的同仁们，长久以来的和平状态，已经使枪炮俱乐部的会员们陷入了悲惨的无所事事的生活中。经过几个世事多变的年头，我们不得不放下我们的工作，暂停我们前进的步伐。但是，我可以大胆且毫不犹豫地说，凡是能使我们重新投入到武器研发工作的战争，都是受欢迎的！”（大厅里响起了热烈的掌声！）“但是，先生们，照目前的情形来看，是不会有战争的；无论我们多么盼望战争的发生，都必须要经历漫长的岁月，才能让我们的大炮再次在战场上轰鸣。因此，我们必须坚定决心，去新的领域寻找我们渴望已久的精神食粮。”","“My brave colleagues, too long already a paralyzing peace has plunged the members of the Gun Club in deplorable inactivity.After a period of years full of incidents we have been compelled to abandon our labors, and to stop short on the road of progress.I do not hesitate to state, baldly, that any war which would recall us to arms would be welcome!” (Tremendous applause!)“But war, gentlemen, is impossible under existing circumstances; and, however we may desire it, many years may elapse before our cannon shall again thunder in the field of battle.We must make up our minds, then, to seek in another train of ideas some field for the activity which we all pine for.”"
"听众们觉得主席马上就要讲到关键部分了，于是听得更加聚精会神。","The meeting felt that the president was now approaching the critical point, and redoubled their attention accordingly."
"“我勇敢的会员们，”巴比康接着说道，“近几个月来，我一直在问自己，是否能在我们的专业范围内，进行一项无愧于十九世纪的伟大实验，炮弹技术的发展是否能够帮助我们实验成功。我一直在思考、工作、计算，研究的结果使我确信，我们定能在一项其他国家看来绝对无法实现的伟大事业中取得成功。这个研究了很长时间的计划，就是我今天报告的内容。它无愧于你们，无愧于枪炮俱乐部的先驱们，可以肯定，它将轰动全世界。”","“For some months past, my brave colleagues,” continued Barbicane, “I have been asking myself whether, while confining ourselves to our own particular objects, we could not enter upon some grand experiment worthy of the nineteenth century; and whether the progress of artillery science would not enable us to carry it out to a successful issue.I have been considering, working, calculating; and the result of my studies is the conviction that we are safe to succeed in an enterprise which to any other country would appear wholly impracticable.This project, the result of long elaboration, is the object of my present communication.It is worthy of yourselves, worthy of the antecedents of the Gun Club; and it cannot fail to make some noise in the world.”"
"会场上一片欢呼声。","A thrill of excitement ran through the meeting."
"巴比康迅速地扶了一下头上的帽子，用平静的声音继续着这次热烈的演说：","Barbicane, having by a rapid movement firmly fixed his hat upon his head, calmly continued his harangue:"
"“我勇敢的会员们，你们每个人都见过月球，至少也听别人谈起过它。假如我在这儿谈到一些关于月球的话题，你们也不要感到奇怪。说不定我们会成为这个未知世界的哥伦布呢。你们能做的就是加入我的计划，并竭尽全力来帮助我，我会带领你们征服它，把它的名字加进这个伟大合众国已有的三十六个州名之中。","“There is no one among you, my brave colleagues, who has not seen the Moon, or, at least, heard speak of it. Don’t be surprised if I am about to discourse to you regarding the Queen of the Night.It is perhaps reserved for us to become the Columbuses of this unknown world.Only enter into my plans, and second me with all your power, and I will lead you to its conquest, and its name shall be added to those of the thirty-six states which compose this Great Union.”"
"“月球，月球，月球！”枪炮俱乐部的全体会员齐声高喊。","“Three cheers for the Moon!” roared the Gun Club, with one voice."
"“各位，我已经对月球进行了详细的研究，”巴比康继续说，“它的质量、密度、重量，它的构成、运动、距离，以及它在太阳系的位置，我已经全部掌握了。我们绘制的月面图已经达到了十分完美的程度，即使不能说比地图绘制得好，至少也是不相上下。此外，照相机还为我们的卫星拍摄了许多美丽无比的照片；总而言之，凡是数学、天文学、地质学、光学能告诉我们的，我们都已经掌握了。但是，直到现在，我们还没有与月球建立任何直接的联系。”","“The moon, gentlemen, has been carefully studied,” continued Barbicane; “her mass, density, and weight; her constitution, motions, distance, as well as her place in the solar system, have all been exactly determined.Selenographic charts have been constructed with a perfection which equals, if it does not even surpass, that of our terrestrial maps.Photography has given us proofs of the incomparable beauty of our satellite; all is known regarding the moon which mathematical science, astronomy, geology, and optics can learn about her.But up to the present moment no direct communication has been established with her.”"
"巴比康的一席话激起了听众们极大的兴趣和惊喜。","A violent movement of interest and surprise here greeted this remark of the speaker."
"“请允许我简明扼要地告诉你们，”他接着说，“几个充满热情的家伙是怎样开始他们的想象之旅，来发现地球卫星的奥秘的。在十七世纪，一个名叫大卫·法布里丘斯的人吹嘘说，他曾亲眼见过月球上的居民。1649年，法国人让·博杜安发表了《多明戈·冈萨雷斯月球历险记》，主人公是一位西班牙冒险家。同一时期，西拉诺·德贝热拉克的《月球远征记》问世了，并在法国风靡一时。之后，另一位来自法国的作家丰特内勒写下了《多元的世界》，这本书成为那个时代的一部名著。1835年前后，曾出版过一本翻译的小册子《美国的纽约》，讲的是约翰·赫谢尔爵士被派到好望角去进行天文计算，他利用一架制作精良的内部照明望远镜，把月球的视觉距离缩短到了八十码！在那里，他清楚地看到了河马经常出没的洞穴，镶着金边的绿山，长着象牙角的绵羊，一种白色的鹿，还有长着蝙蝠般膜状羽翼的居民。这本由美国人洛克撰写的小册子获得了巨大成功。但是，在结束这简短的陈述之前，我要补充一下，还有一个名叫汉斯·普伐阿尔的鹿特丹人，从氮气中提炼出一种比氢气还轻三十七倍的气体，他坐着充满这种气体的气球飞上了天，并且经过十九小时的飞行，到达了月球。这起旅行，跟我之前所提到的那几次尝试是一样的，纯粹是幻想；然而，这部作品却出自于一位杰出的美国作家——埃德加·坡之手！”","“Permit me,” he continued, “to recount to you briefly how certain ardent spirits, starting on imaginary journeys, have penetrated the secrets of our satellite.In the seventeenth century a certain David Fabricius boasted of having seen with his own eyes the inhabitants of the moon.In 1649 a Frenchman, one Jean Baudoin, published a ‘Journey performed from the Earth to the Moon by Domingo Gonzalez,’ a Spanish adventurer.At the same period Cyrano de Bergerac published that celebrated ‘Journeys in the Moon’ which met with such success in France.Somewhat later another Frenchman, named Fontenelle, wrote ‘The Plurality of Worlds,’ a chef-d’oeuvre of its time.About 1835 a small treatise, translated from the New York American, related how Sir John Herschel, having been despatched to the Cape of Good Hope for the purpose of making there some astronomical calculations, had, by means of a telescope brought to perfection by means of internal lighting, reduced the apparent distance of the moon to eighty yards!He then distinctly perceived caverns frequented by hippopotami, green mountains bordered by golden lace-work, sheep with horns of ivory, a white species of deer and inhabitants with membranous wings, like bats.This brochure, the work of an American named Locke, had a great sale.But, to bring this rapid sketch to a close, I will only add that a certain Hans Pfaal, of Rotterdam, launching himself in a balloon filled with a gas extracted from nitrogen, thirty-seven times lighter than hydrogen, reached the moon after a passage of nineteen hours.This journey, like all previous ones, was purely imaginary; still, it was the work of a popular American author— I mean Edgar Poe!”"
"“为埃德加·坡欢呼！”听众被主席的一番话触动了，齐声高喊。","“Cheers for Edgar Poe!” roared the assemblage, electrified by their president’s words."
"“以上我所列举的这些，”巴比康说道，“只能称之为纯粹的文学尝试，而仅凭这些是无法与月球建立真正联系的。不过，我一定要说明一下，确实有一些善于实践的人们曾尝试着与月球建立现实的联系。比如不久前，一位德国几何学家提议派遣一支科学远征队到西伯利亚大草原进行考察。他们将在广阔的草原上，用反射光源组成的符号来绘制一些巨大的几何图形，其中包括被法国人称为‘愚人桥’的‘弦的平方图’。‘每一个懂知识的人，’那位几何学家说，‘都会明白这些几何图形的科学含义。如果月球人的确存在的话，他们就会用类似的图形来回应我们；一旦建立了联系，就不难制出一张字母表，这样就可以和月球上的居民交谈了。’以上就是这位德国几何学家所说的话；不过，他的计划并没有被执行，并且直到现在，地球和它的卫星之间也没有建立任何的联系。也许老天故意将机会留给我们这些具有真才实学的美国人，让我们来建立与外星世界的联系。到达那里的方法是简单、容易、可靠、万无一失的——这也是我这个计划的议题所在。”","“I have now enumerated,” said Barbicane, “the experiments which I call purely paper ones, and wholly insufficient to establish serious relations with the Queen of the Night.Nevertheless, I am bound to add that some practical geniuses have attempted to establish actual communication with her.Thus, a few days ago, a German geometrician proposed to send a scientific expedition to the steppes of Siberia.There, on those vast plains, they were to describe enormous geometric figures, drawn in characters of reflecting luminosity, among which was the proposition regarding the ‘square of the hypothenuse’, commonly called the ‘Ass’s Bridge’ by the French.‘Every intelligent being,’ said the geometrician, ‘must understand the scientific meaning of that figure.The Selenites, do they exist, will respond by a similar figure; and, a communication being thus once established, it will be easy to form an alphabet which shall enable us to converse with the inhabitants of the moon.’ So spoke the German geometrician; but his project was never put into practice, and up to the present day there is no bond in existence between the Earth and her satellite.It is reserved for the practical genius of Americans to establish a communication with the sidereal world.The means of arriving thither are simple, easy, certain, infallible—and that is the purpose of my present proposal.”"
"大厅里随即响起一阵热烈的欢呼声。会场上的每一位听众，都被他的话征服了，迷住了，激动得不能自已！","A storm of acclamations greeted these words.There was not a single person in the whole audience who was not overcome, carried away, lifted out of himself by the speaker’s words!"
"雷鸣般的掌声再一次回荡在大厅里，经久不息。","Long-continued applause resounded from all sides."
"兴奋的热潮刚刚有些平息，巴比康便继续讲起话来，语气比之前多了几分严肃。","As soon as the excitement had partially subsided, Barbicane resumed his speech in a somewhat graver voice."
"“你们知道，”他说，“近几年炮术学取得了多么大的发展，每一种武器都达到了何等完美的程度。此外，你们也知道，一般来说大炮的反冲力和火药的膨胀力几乎是无限的。好啦！我问过我自己，基于这个原理，假如有一种装置，足以顶住一定的反冲力，我们是否能把一颗炮弹送到月球上去呢？”","“You know,” said he, “what progress artillery science has made during the last few years, and what a degree of perfection firearms of every kind have reached.Moreover, you are well aware that, in general terms, the resisting power of cannon and the expansive force of gunpowder are practically unlimited.Well! starting from this principle, I ask myself whether, supposing sufficient apparatus could be obtained constructed upon the conditions of ascertained resistance, it might not be possible to project a shot up to the moon?”"
"话音刚落，一阵惊讶的低语声从上千名屏息凝神的听众的胸膛里传出；接下来是片刻的寂静，仿佛雷雨即将来临。事实上，雷声的确响了起来，不过那是由掌声、欢呼声和呐喊声构成的雷鸣，大厅似乎都被撼动了。主席试图说下去，但他的话总是被淹没。整整过了十分钟，人们才能听清他说的话。","At these words a murmur of amazement escaped from a thousand panting chests; then succeeded a moment of perfect silence, resembling that profound stillness which precedes the bursting of a thunderstorm.In point of fact, a thunderstorm did peal forth, but it was the thunder of applause, or cries, and of uproar which made the very hall tremble.The president attempted to speak, but could not. It was fully ten minutes before he could make himself heard."
"“请让我说完。”他冷静地说。“我已经从各个方面考虑了这个问题，我坚定地研究过它，并通过无可辩驳的计算发现：只要一枚炮弹的初速度达到每秒一万两千码，它就一定能到达月球。我勇敢的会员们，我很荣幸地站在这里，建议你们尝试一下这个小小的实验。”","“Suffer me to finish,” he calmly continued.“I have looked at the question in all its bearings, I have resolutely attacked it, and by incontrovertible calculations I find that a projectile endowed with an initial velocity of 12,000 yards per second, and aimed at the moon, must necessarily reach it.I have the honor, my brave colleagues, to propose a trial of this little experiment.”"
"第三章 巴比康主席的报告所产生的影响","CHAPTER III EFFECT OF THE PRESIDENT’S COMMUNICATION"
"这位可敬的主席最后的几句话所产生的影响是难以用语言形容的——叫声、喊声、接连不断的呐喊和欢呼，以及你能想到的美国英语中的各种拟声词，应有尽有。这是一个难以形容的场面，混乱而喧闹。他们呐喊，拍手，使劲用脚跺着大厅的地板。即使博物馆里的所有武器一起开火，也不能制造出比这更猛烈的声波。其实也不必大惊小怪。有些炮手的嗓门几乎比得上他们的大炮。","It is impossible to describe the effect produced by the last words of the honorable president—the cries, the shouts, the succession of roars, hurrahs, and all the varied vociferations which the American language is capable of supplying.It was a scene of indescribable confusion and uproar.They shouted, they clapped, they stamped on the floor of the hall.All the weapons in the museum discharged at once could not have more violently set in motion the waves of sound.One need not be surprised at this.There are some cannoneers nearly as noisy as their own guns."
"在这狂热的喧闹声中，巴比康依然保持着冷静。可能他还有话对他的会员们说，因为他正打着手势请他们安静，他手中的小铃也拼命发出爆破声，都快被摇坏了。然而，根本没人注意到他的请求。没过多久，人们便把他从座位上拉了下来，忠心的会员们把他扛在肩上，接着又把他传到同样兴奋的群众们手上。","Barbicane remained calm in the midst of this enthusiastic clamor; perhaps he was desirous of addressing a few more words to his colleagues, for by his gestures he demanded silence, and his powerful alarum was worn out by its violent reports.No attention, however, was paid to his request.He was presently torn from his seat and passed from the hands of his faithful colleagues into the arms of a no less excited crowd."
"没有什么事能让美国人大吃一惊。人们常常断言法语里没有“不可能”这个词。很明显，他们是被字典骗了。在美国，一切都很容易，一切都很简单，至于机械上的难题，都是在出现之前就被解决了。从巴比康这个建议的提出，一直到它实现，任何一个真正的美国佬都不容许困难出现，哪怕是一点点困难。他们总是说做就做。","Nothing can astound an American.It has often been asserted that the word “impossible” in not a French one.People have evidently been deceived by the dictionary.In America, all is easy, all is simple; and as for mechanical difficulties, they are overcome before they arise.Between Barbicane’s proposition and its realization no true Yankee would have allowed even the semblance of a difficulty to be possible.A thing with them is no sooner said than done."
"主席的胜利游行一直持续到深夜。这是一次地道的火炬游行。爱尔兰人、德国人、法国人、苏格兰人，马里兰州各个种族的居民全部混杂在一起，用他们各自的方言高呼着，用一句句“万岁”、“好哇”、“妙极了”表达着心中难以形容的热情。","The triumphal progress of the president continued throughout the evening.It was a regular torchlight procession.Irish, Germans, French, Scotch, all the heterogeneous units which make up the population of Maryland shouted in their respective vernaculars; and the “vivas,” “hurrahs,” and “bravos” were intermingled in inexpressible enthusiasm."
"恰恰在这个时候，月亮好像知道这阵骚动跟自己有关似的，发出宁静的光芒，周围所有的灯光都淹没在它明亮的光辉中。所有的美国佬都抬头凝望着这颗灿烂的星球，向她频频飞吻，用各种亲昵的名字呼唤她。从八点到半夜的这几个小时里，琼下街的一个眼镜商靠卖小型望远镜发了财。","Just at this crisis, as though she comprehended all this agitation regarding herself, the moon shone forth with serene splendor, eclipsing by her intense illumination all the surrounding lights.The Yankees all turned their gaze toward her resplendent orb, kissed their hands, called her by all kinds of endearing names.Between eight o’clock and midnight one optician in Jones’-Fall Street made his fortune by the sale of opera-glasses."
"午夜的钟声敲响了，人们的热情却丝毫没有减退的迹象。这种热情均等地遍布于各个阶层的市民中——科学家、小店主、商人、搬运工、董事长，还有新到的移民，都被拨动了心弦。这是一个利益攸关的全国性事业。整个城市到处都是狂欢的人们，帕塔普斯科河畔的码头上，以及港湾里停泊着的船只上，都挤满了人，他们喝着杜松子酒和威士忌，醉醺醺，乐陶陶。从手拿一杯雪利酒，懒洋洋地躺在酒吧间沙发上的绅士，到喝着烧心烈酒，在波茵特港的肮脏酒馆里一醉方休的水手，人们议论纷纷，争论不休，高声喝彩。","Midnight arrived, and the enthusiasm showed no signs of diminution.It spread equally among all classes of citizens— men of science, shopkeepers, merchants, porters, chair-men, as well as “greenhorns,” were stirred in their innermost fibres.A national enterprise was at stake.The whole city, high and low, the quays bordering the Patapsco, the ships lying in the basins, disgorged a crowd drunk with joy, gin, and whisky.Every one chattered, argued, discussed, disputed, applauded, from the gentleman lounging upon the barroom settee with his tumbler of sherry-cobbler before him down to the waterman who got drunk upon his “knock-me-down” in the dingy taverns of Fell Point."
"大约在凌晨两点的时候，人们兴奋的情绪才开始平息。巴比康主席回到家时，已经浑身是伤，骨头都快被压碎了，整个人几乎被挤成了干尸。就算是大力神赫拉克勒斯，肯定也禁不起这番热情的折腾。人群渐渐从广场和街道上散去。汇合于巴尔的摩的四条通往费城、华盛顿、哈里斯堡和惠灵的铁路把形形色色的人们送回美国的各个角落之后，这个城市才相对安静下来。","About two A.M., however, the excitement began to subside.President Barbicane reached his house, bruised, crushed, and squeezed almost to a mummy.Hercules could not have resisted a similar outbreak of enthusiasm.The crowd gradually deserted the squares and streets.The four railways from Philadelphia and Washington, Harrisburg and Wheeling, which converge at Baltimore, whirled away the heterogeneous population to the four corners of the United States, and the city subsided into comparative tranquility."
"第二天，这个消息通过电报传到了各大媒体，五百多家报纸和杂志，包括日报、周报、月刊以及双月刊，都开始探讨这个问题。他们从物理学、气象学、经济学和伦理学等各个方面，对这个问题做了仔细的分析，最后上升到它在政治和文明上的意义。他们争论着月球上的世界是已经进化完全了，还是注定要经历进一步的转变。现在的月球，是否就像大气层还未形成时的地球一样呢？我们在地球上无法观察到的那个半球，又隐藏着怎样的景象呢？就算当前的问题只不过是向月球发射一颗炮弹，每个人想必也都意识到了，这只是一系列实验的开端。所有的人想必都希望，有一天美国能够发现这个神秘天体最深处的秘密；有的人甚至开始担心，征服月球会明显打破欧洲的均势。","On the following day, thanks to the telegraphic wires, five hundred newspapers and journals, daily, weekly, monthly, or bi-monthly, all took up the question.They examined it under all its different aspects, physical, meteorological, economical, or moral, up to its bearings on politics or civilization.They debated whether the moon was a finished world, or whether it was destined to undergo any further transformation.Did it resemble the earth at the period when the latter was destitute as yet of an atmosphere?What kind of spectacle would its hidden hemisphere present to our terrestrial spheroid?Granting that the question at present was simply that of sending a projectile up to the moon, every one must see that that involved the commencement of a series of experiments.All must hope that some day America would penetrate the deepest secrets of that mysterious orb; and some even seemed to fear lest its conquest should not sensibly derange the equilibrium of Europe."
"一经讨论，没有一份报道对这项计划的实现表示怀疑。所有文章、小册子、报告——各种科学、文学和宗教团体出版的全部杂志都夸大了这项计划的优势；波士顿自然史协会、奥尔巴尼科学与艺术协会、纽约地理与统计协会、费城哲学协会以及华盛顿史密森学会，都给枪炮俱乐部发来了无数封贺信，并表示愿意立即提供人力和资金上的援助。","The project once under discussion, not a single paragraph suggested a doubt of its realization.All the papers, pamphlets, reports—all the journals published by the scientific, literary, and religious societies enlarged upon its advantages; and the Society of Natural History of Boston, the Society of Science and Art of Albany, the Geographical and Statistical Society of New York, the Philosophical Society of Philadelphia, and the Smithsonian of Washington sent innumerable letters of congratulation to the Gun Club, together with offers of immediate assistance and money."
"从那天起，英庇·巴比康成了美国最伟大的公民之一，简直就像科学界的华盛顿。众人对他的崇敬之情是那样的一致，这足以告诉我们，这个国家的全部民众对这个人的崇拜达到了什么程度。","From that day forward Impey Barbicane became one of the greatest citizens of the United States, a kind of Washington of science.A single trait of feeling, taken from many others, will serve to show the point which this homage of a whole people to a single individual attained."
"枪炮俱乐部这次值得纪念的会议结束几天后，一个英国公司的经理宣布，将在巴尔的摩剧院上演戏剧《无事生非》。但是，市民们认为该剧的名字中暗含着对巴比康主席的计划的侮辱，于是冲进剧院，砸烂凳子，并强迫那个倒霉的经理更换节目单。那家伙挺识时务，顺从了公众的意愿，把那部激起民愤的喜剧换成了《皆大欢喜》，一连好多个星期都获得了惊人的票房收入。","Some few days after this memorable meeting of the Gun Club, the manager of an English company announced, at the Baltimore theatre, the production of “Much ado about Nothing.” But the populace, seeing in that title an allusion damaging to Barbicane’s project, broke into the auditorium, smashed the benches, and compelled the unlucky director to alter his playbill.Being a sensible man, he bowed to the public will and replaced the offending comedy by “As you like it”; and for many weeks he realized fabulous profits."
"第四章 剑桥天文台的回信","CHAPTER IV REPLY FROM THE OBSERVATORY OF CAMBRIDGE"
"然而，成为人们狂热膜拜对象的巴比康并没有浪费一分钟时间。他要做的第一件事就是再次把他的会员们召集到枪炮俱乐部的会议室里。在那里，经过一番讨论之后，大家一致同意咨询一些天文学家，请他们帮助解决计划中天文学方面的问题。一旦得到回复，他们就可以着手讨论机械装置问题，为了确保这个伟大实验的成功，任何事情都疏忽不得。","Barbicane, however, lost not one moment amid all the enthusiasm of which he had become the object.His first care was to reassemble his colleagues in the board-room of the Gun Club.There, after some discussion, it was agreed to consult the astronomers regarding the astronomical part of the enterprise.Their reply once ascertained, they could then discuss the mechanical means, and nothing should be wanting to ensure the success of this great experiment."
"于是，他们拟定了一份措辞严谨、咨询内容明确具体的信函，寄往马萨诸塞州的剑桥天文台。剑桥，美国历史上第一所大学的所在地，它因天文学人才而获得的美誉是名副其实的。可以说，所有最杰出的科学家都聚集在这里。在那里，你可以看见那架威力强大的望远镜，它曾帮助邦德发现仙女座星云，帮助克拉克发现天狼星卫星。这个著名的机构从各个方面证明了，枪炮俱乐部有充分的理由信任它。就这样，两天之后，巴比康主席拿到了那封大家翘首以盼的回信。","A note couched in precise terms, containing special interrogatories, was then drawn up and addressed to the Observatory of Cambridge in Massachusetts.This city, where the first university of the United States was founded, is justly celebrated for its astronomical staff.There are to be found assembled all the most eminent men of science.Here is to be seen at work that powerful telescope which enabled Bond to resolve the nebula of Andromeda, and Clarke to discover the satellite of Sirius.This celebrated institution fully justified on all points the confidence reposed in it by the Gun Club.So, after two days, the reply so impatiently awaited was placed in the hands of President Barbicane."
"信中是这样说的：","It was couched in the following terms:"
"剑桥天文台台长致巴尔的摩枪炮俱乐部主席。","The Director of the Cambridge Observatory to the President of the Gun Club at Baltimore."
"剑桥，十月七号。我台收到贵俱乐部于本月六号以全体会员的名义寄来的信函后，立即召集员工进行了商讨，对于信中提到的问题，我们暂回复如下：","CAMBRIDGE, October 7.On the receipt of your favor of the 6th instant, addressed to the Observatory of Cambridge in the name of the members of the Baltimore Gun Club, our staff was immediately called together, and it was judged expedient to reply as follows:"
"以下是你们所提的问题——","The questions which have been proposed to it are these—"
"“1.向月球发射炮弹可能吗？","“1. Is it possible to transmit a projectile up to the moon?"
"“2.地球和它的卫星之间的准确距离是多少？","“2. What is the exact distance which separates the earth from its satellite?"
"“3.在足够的初始速度推动下，炮弹到达月球需要多长时间？这样说来，在什么时候发射，才能使炮弹坠落在月球的特定点上？","“3. What will be the period of transit of the projectile when endowed with sufficient initial velocity? and, consequently, at what moment ought it to be discharged in order that it may touch the moon at a particular point?"
"“4.月球出现在炮弹最易到达的位置上的确切时间是多少？","“4. At what precise moment will the moon present herself in the most favorable position to be reached by the projectile?"
"“5.发射炮弹的大炮应瞄准天空的哪一点？","“5. What point in the heavens ought the cannon to be aimed at which is intended to discharge the projectile?"
"“6.发射炮弹时，月球应在天空的什么方位？”","“6. What place will the moon occupy in the heavens at the moment of the projectile’s departure?”"
"关于第一个问题：“向月球发射炮弹可能吗？”","Regarding the first question, “Is it possible to transmit a projectile up to the moon?”"
"我们的回答是——可能，假如炮弹的初速度能够达到每秒12,000码的话，计算证明这个速度已经足够了。在物体逐渐离开地球的过程中，地球引力也逐渐减小，与距离的平方成反比。也就是说，当距离变为原来的三倍，地球引力就会相应地变为原来的九分之一。因此，炮弹的重力就会减小，最后，当月球引力与地球引力恰好达到平衡，也就是说，炮弹到达全程五十二分之四十七的地方时，它的重力就减为零。在那一个时间点，炮弹已经完全失重，一旦经过这一点，它就能单单凭借月球的引力到达月球。因此，从理论上，该实验的可能性已经得到了充分的论证。至于能不能成功，就要看发射装置的威力如何了。","Answer.—Yes; provided it possess an initial velocity of 12,000 yards per second; calculations prove that to be sufficient.In proportion as we recede from the earth the action of gravitation diminishes in the inverse ratio of the square of the distance; that is to say, at three times a given distance the action is nine times less.Consequently, the weight of a shot will decrease, and will become reduced to zero at the instant that the attraction of the moon exactly counterpoises that of the earth; that is to say at 47/52 of its passage.At that instant the projectile will have no weight whatever; and, if it passes that point, it will fall into the moon by the sole effect of the lunar attraction.The theoretical possibility of the experiment is therefore absolutely demonstrated; its success must depend upon the power of the engine employed."
"对于第二个问题：“地球和它的卫星之间的准确距离是多少？”","As to the second question, “What is the exact distance which separates the earth from its satellite?”"
"答案是这样的——月球绕地球运行的轨道不是正圆形的，而是椭圆的，这样地球就占据着其中的一个焦点。因此，月球离地球时近时远，用天文学的术语来说就是，有时在远地点，有时在近地点。从目前来看，最远距离与最近距离的差值是相当大的，大到不容我们忽视。实际上，月球的远地点距我们247,552英里，近地点距我们仅有218,657英里；相差28,895英里，超过了全程的九分之一。这样看来，我们应该以月球近地点的距离为基础进行计算。","Answer.—The moon does not describe a circle round the earth, but rather an ellipse, of which our earth occupies one of the foci; the consequence, therefore, is, that at certain times it approaches nearer to, and at others it recedes farther from, the earth; in astronomical language, it is at one time in apogee, at another in perigee.Now the difference between its greatest and its least distance is too considerable to be left out of consideration.In point of fact, in its apogee the moon is 247,552 miles, and in its perigee, 218,657 miles only distant; a fact which makes a difference of 28,895 miles, or more than one-ninth of the entire distance.The perigee distance, therefore, is that which ought to serve as the basis of all calculations."
"下面是第三个问题。","To the third question."
"答案如下——如果炮弹能一直保持每秒12,000码的初速度，那么，只需要九小时多一点儿就可以到达月球。但是，由于初速度会不断降低，炮弹需要30万秒，即83小时20分钟才能到达地球和月球引力平衡的地点。这之后，还需要五万秒，即13小时53分20秒才能到达月球。因此，应该在月球到达瞄准点之前97小时十三分二十秒将炮弹发射出去。","Answer.—If the shot should preserve continuously its initial velocity of 12,000 yards per second, it would require little more than nine hours to reach its destination; but, inasmuch as that initial velocity will be continually decreasing, it will occupy 300,000 seconds, that is 83hrs. 20m. in reaching the point where the attraction of the earth and moon will be in equilibrio.From this point it will fall into the moon in 50,000 seconds, or 13hrs. 53m. 20sec.It will be desirable, therefore, to discharge it 97hrs. 13m. 20sec. before the arrival of the moon at the point aimed at."
"对于第四个问题：“月球何时会出现在炮弹最易到达的位置上,等等？”","Regarding question four, “At what precise moment will the moon present herself in the most favorable position, etc.?”"
"回答——根据上面所提到的，首先应选择月球到达近地点、同时又穿过天顶的时刻，当月球穿过天顶时，能减少相当于地球半径那么长的距离，即3,919英里。这样一来，炮弹到达月球的既定距离就只剩下214,976英里了。但是，虽然月球每个月都经过近地点，但并不总是在同一时刻经过天顶。要经过很长的时间间隔，这两种现象才能同时出现。所以，必须等待月球同时穿过近地点和天顶的时刻。幸运的是，明年的十二月四日，月球恰巧符合这两个条件。在半夜，月球将到达近地点，也就是说离地球最近，并且会同时穿过天顶。","Answer.—After what has been said above, it will be necessary, first of all, to choose the period when the moon will be in perigee, and also the moment when she will be crossing the zenith, which latter event will further diminish the entire distance by a length equal to the radius of the earth, i. e. 3,919 miles; the result of which will be that the final passage remaining to be accomplished will be 214,976 miles.But although the moon passes her perigee every month, she does not reach the zenith always at exactly the same moment.She does not appear under these two conditions simultaneously, except at long intervals of time.It will be necessary, therefore, to wait for the moment when her passage in perigee shall coincide with that in the zenith.Now, by a fortunate circumstance, on the 4th of December in the ensuing year the moon will present these two conditions.At midnight she will be in perigee, that is, at her shortest distance from the earth, and at the same moment she will be crossing the zenith."
"关于第五个问题：“发射炮弹的大炮应瞄准天空的哪一点？”","On the fifth question, “At what point in the heavens ought the cannon to be aimed?”"
"回答——从前面的分析来看，大炮应瞄准天顶点。只有这样，射击线才能和地平线垂直，炮弹才能在最短时间内摆脱地球引力。但是，为了能使月球到达天顶，发射地的纬度必须不能高于天体的磁偏角；也就是说，必须在北纬或南纬零度至28度之间的地区发射。在其他任何地方，都必须要倾斜射击，而这样就会严重影响实验的成功。","Answer.—The preceding remarks being admitted, the cannon ought to be pointed to the zenith of the place.Its fire, therefore, will be perpendicular to the plane of the horizon; and the projectile will soonest pass beyond the range of the terrestrial attraction.But, in order that the moon should reach the zenith of a given place, it is necessary that the place should not exceed in latitude the declination of the luminary; in other words, it must be comprised within the degrees 0° and 28° of lat. N. or S. In every other spot the fire must necessarily be oblique, which would seriously militate against the success of the experiment."
"第六个问题：“发射炮弹时，月球应在天空的什么方位？”","As to the sixth question, “What place will the moon occupy in the heavens at the moment of the projectile’s departure?”"
"回答——由于月球每天行进13度10分35秒，发射炮弹时，月球与天顶的夹角应是这个度数的四倍，也就是52度41分20秒，这个度数正符合炮弹整个路程所需的时间。但是，我们必须考虑到地球自转给发射带来的偏差，炮弹到达月球前，要产生相当于十六个地球半径的偏差，按照月球轨道计算，大约在11度左右，所以应该也把这11度加到上面所提到的月球与天顶的夹角中：也就是说，月球与天顶的夹角应该大概是64度。因此，向月球发射炮弹时，月球的视觉半径必须和垂直线交叉成64度角。","Answer.— At the moment when the projectile shall be discharged into space, the moon, which travels daily forward 13° 10’ 35”, will be distant from the zenith point by four times that quantity, i. e. by 52°41’ 20”, a space which corresponds to the path which she will describe during the entire journey of the projectile.But, inasmuch as it is equally necessary to take into account the deviation which the rotary motion of the earth will impart to the shot, and as the shot cannot reach the moon until after a deviation equal to 16 radii of the earth, which, calculated upon the moon’s orbit, are equal to about eleven degrees, it becomes necessary to add these eleven degrees to those which express the retardation of the moon just mentioned: that is to say, in round numbers, about sixty-four degrees.Consequently, at the moment of firing the visual radius applied to the moon will describe, with the vertical line of the place, an angle of sixty-four degrees."
"以下就是枪炮俱乐部成员在寄给剑桥天文台的信中所提出的问题的答案：","These are our answers to the questions proposed to the Observatory of Cambridge by the members of the Gun Club:"
"总的来说，有这样几点——","To sum up—"
"第一、大炮装置应设在南纬或北纬零度到二十八度之间的区域。","1st. The cannon ought to be planted in a country situated between 0° and 28° of N.or S. lat."
"第二、炮口应正好瞄准天顶点。","2nd. It ought to be pointed directly toward the zenith of the place."
"第三、被发射炮弹的初速度应达到每秒12,000码。","3rd. The projectile ought to be propelled with an initial velocity of 12,000 yards per second."
"第四、炮弹应于明年十二月一日10点46分40秒准时发射。","4th. It ought to be discharged at 10hrs. 46m. 40sec. of the 1st of December of the ensuing year."
"第五、炮弹将在发射四天后达到月球，确切地说是十二月四日凌晨，即月球穿过天顶的时候。","5th. It will meet the moon four days after its discharge, precisely at midnight on the 4th of December, at the moment of its transit across the zenith."
"因此，贵俱乐部的会员们应立即投入到实验所需要的各项工作中，而且必须在指定的时刻到来之前做好发射准备；因为，一旦错过了这一个十二月四日，就必须再过18年零11天才能遇到月球同时穿过近地点和天顶点的情况。","The members of the Gun Club ought, therefore, without delay, to commence the works necessary for such an experiment, and to be prepared to set to work at the moment determined upon; for, if they should suffer this 4th of December to go by, they will not find the moon again under the same conditions of perigee and of zenith until eighteen years and eleven days afterward."

"第五章 关于月球的故事","CHAPTER V THE ROMANCE OF THE MOON"
"假使一个视野广阔的观察者，于混沌时期，置身于整个宇宙绕之旋转的那个未知的中心，便会看到充斥宇宙空间的无数原子。但是，随着时代的变迁，宇宙也慢慢地发生了变化；引力定律出现了，迄今为止，处于游离状态的原子一直受这条定律的支配：这些原子在它们的引力作用下化合成分子，继而组成了点缀在遥远天幕的星云状物质。这些星云状的物质立即围绕着自己的中心点，开始了旋转运动。而这个由无数分子组成的中心，也在逐渐凝聚的过程中围绕自己的轴心旋转着；在亘古不变的力学定律的作用下，随着凝聚过程中体积的缩小，其旋转速度相应地越来越大，久而久之，在这两种变化的影响下，形成了一颗主星，也就是星云状物质的中心。","An observer endued with an infinite range of vision, and placed in that unknown center around which the entire world revolves, might have beheld myriads of atoms filling all space during the chaotic epoch of the universe.Little by little, as ages went on, a change took place; a general law of attraction manifested itself, to which the hitherto errant atoms became obedient: these atoms combined together chemically according to their affinities, formed themselves into molecules, and composed those nebulous masses with which the depths of the heavens are strewed.These masses became immediately endued with a rotary motion around their own central point.This center, formed of indefinite molecules, began to revolve around its own axis during its gradual condensation; then, following the immutable laws of mechanics, in proportion as its bulk diminished by condensation, its rotary motion became accelerated, and these two effects continuing, the result was the formation of one principal star, the center of the nebulous mass."
"观察者通过仔细观测，便会发现星云状物质中的其他分子也和这颗主星一样，随着旋转速度越来越大而逐渐凝聚，形成数不清的恒星，在引力作用下分布在主星周围。星云就是这样形成的，而据天文学家计算，如今宇宙中已有近5,000个星云。","By attentively watching, the observer would then have perceived the other molecules of the mass, following the example of this central star, become likewise condensed by gradually accelerated rotation, and gravitating round it in the shape of innumerable stars.Thus was formed the Nebulae, of which astronomers have reckoned up nearly 5,000."
"在这5,000个星云中，有一个被人们称做“银河”的星云，它由1,800万颗恒星组成，每一颗恒星都是一个太阳系的中心。","Among these 5,000 nebulae there is one which has received the name of the Milky Way, and which contains eighteen millions of stars, each of which has become the center of a solar world."
"如果观察者特别注意一下其中那颗不起眼的、暗淡的四等星，那个妄自尊大的、被称为“太阳”的天体，那么太阳系形成时的全部现象就会一幕幕在他眼前浮现。实际上，他应该已经意识到，当时的太阳还处于气态，是由无数移动的分子组成的，这些分子为了凝聚成一个整体，不停地围绕轴心旋转着。这一运动是符合力学定律的，物体的运动速度会随着体积的缩小而增大；于是，到了某一时刻，把分子拉向中心的向心力就会被离心力战胜。","If the observer had then specially directed his attention to one of the more humble and less brilliant of these stellar bodies, a star of the fourth class, that which is arrogantly called the Sun, all the phenomena to which the formation of the Universe is to be ascribed would have been successively fulfilled before his eyes.In fact, he would have perceived this sun, as yet in the gaseous state, and composed of moving molecules, revolving round its axis in order to accomplish its work of concentration.This motion, faithful to the laws of mechanics, would have been accelerated with the diminution of its volume; and a moment would have arrived when the centrifugal force would have overpowered the centripetal, which causes the molecules all to tend toward the center."
"此时，另一现象将在观察者眼前上演：位于赤道平面上的分子突然脱离了赤道，就像投石器的绳子突然断掉、石头从里面飞出来一样，并围绕太阳形成了许多同心圆，和土星的光环相仿。这些环状的宇宙物质围着它们共同的中心旋转着，之后，也会分解成一团团星云状的物质，也就是说，会分解成一颗颗行星。同样地，这些行星会抛射出一圈或多圈环状的宇宙物质，这也就是被我们称作“卫星”的次级天体的起源。","Another phenomenon would now have passed before the observer’s eye, and the molecules situated on the plane of the equator, escaping like a stone from a sling of which the cord had suddenly snapped, would have formed around the sun sundry concentric rings resembling that of Saturn.In their turn, again, these rings of cosmical matter, excited by a rotary motion about the central mass, would have been broken up and decomposed into secondary nebulosities, that is to say, into planets.Similarly he would have observed these planets throw off one or more rings each, which became the origin of the secondary bodies which we call satellites."
"所以，从原子到分子，从分子到星云状物质，从星云状物质到主星，从主星到太阳，从太阳到行星，再从行星到卫星，我们看到了宇宙初期的天体所经过的一系列演变。","Thus, then, advancing from atom to molecule, from molecule to nebulous mass, from that to principal star, from star to sun, from sun to planet, and hence to satellite, we have the whole series of transformations undergone by the heavenly bodies during the first days of the world."
"现在，在那些被太阳用强大的引力定律束缚在椭圆形轨道上的天体中，有几个相应地有自己的卫星。天王星有八颗卫星，土星有八颗，木星有四颗，海王星大概有三颗，而地球只有一颗。这颗卫星，这颗全太阳系最微不足道的卫星，就是我们口中的月球；也正是它，成了美国那些大胆的天才们意在征服的对象。","Now, of those attendant bodies which the sun maintains in their elliptical orbits by the great law of gravitation, some few in turn possess satellites.Uranus has eight, Saturn eight, Jupiter four, Neptune possibly three, and the Earth one.This last, one of the least important of the entire solar system, we call the Moon; and it is she whom the daring genius of the Americans professed their intention of conquering."
"月球距离地球比较近，并且由于月相的改变，时常呈现出不同的面貌，因而一直被地球上的居民密切关注着。","The moon, by her comparative proximity, and the constantly varying appearances produced by her several phases, has always occupied a considerable share of the attention of the inhabitants of the earth."
"从公元前五世纪米利都的泰利斯时代，到公元十五世纪的哥白尼和十六世纪的第谷·布拉赫，他们的观察有时或多或少带有一定的正确性，直到当代，月球山系的高度才被精确地计算出来。伽利略用山脉的存在解释了月球在某几个相位的光现象，他认为月球山脉的平均高度为27,000英尺。在他之后，但泽的天文学家赫维留认为月球山脉最高为15,000英尺；但意大利天文学家里希奥利经过计算，认为这一高度应该有21,000英尺。","From the time of Thales of Miletus, in the fifth century B.C., down to that of Copernicus in the fifteenth and Tycho Brahe in the sixteenth century A.D., observations have been from time to time carried on with more or less correctness, until in the present day the altitudes of the lunar mountains have been determined with exactitude.Galileo explained the phenomena of the lunar light produced during certain of her phases by the existence of mountains, to which he assigned a mean altitude of 27,000 feet.After him Hevelius, an astronomer of Dantzic, reduced the highest elevations to 15,000 feet; but the calculations of Riccioli brought them up again to 21,000 feet."
"在十八世纪末，赫歇耳利用一架强大的望远镜，大幅削减了先前的测量数据。他认为，月球山脉最高为11,400英尺，并把各个山峰的平均高度降低到了2,400英尺。但是，赫歇耳的计算又相继被哈雷、纳斯密斯、比安基尼、克利杜伊逊以及其他天文学者的观测数据纠正。这个问题最终被比尔和马德累尔彻底解决。他们成功测量了1,905座高度不等的山峰，其中六座超过15，000英尺，22座超过14,400英尺。最高的山峰则高出月球表面22,606英尺。就在同一时期，对月球的考察也完成了。据观测，月球表面布满了陨石坑，而且每一次观测都能明显证实，它们基本上是由火山岩构成的。因为没有来自那些被月球遮盖的行星的光的折射，我们可以断定，月球上没有空气。没有空气，自然也就没有水。所以很显然，月球上的人要想在这种条件下生存，必须有某种特殊的身体构造，一定和生活在地球上的居民大不相同。","At the close of the eighteenth century Herschel, armed with a powerful telescope, considerably reduced the preceding measurements.He assigned a height of 11,400 feet to the maximum elevations, and reduced the mean of the different altitudes to little more than 2,400 feet.But Herschel’s calculations were in their turn corrected by the observations of Halley, Nasmyth, Bianchini, Gruithuysen, and others; but it was reserved for the labors of Boeer and Maedler finally to solve the question.They succeeded in measuring 1,905 different elevations, of which six exceed 15,000 feet, and twenty-two exceed 14,400 feet.The highest summit of all towers to a height of 22,606 feet above the surface of the lunar disc. At the same period the examination of the moon was completed.She appeared completely riddled with craters, and her essentially volcanic character was apparent at each observation.By the absence of refraction in the rays of the planets occulted by her we conclude that she is absolutely devoid of an atmosphere.The absence of air entails the absence of water.It became, therefore, manifest that the Selenites, to support life under such conditions, must possess a special organization of their own, must differ remarkably from the inhabitants of the earth."
"总之，由于现代技术的不断发展，一些高度精密的仪器不停地探索着月球，月球表面的每一个角落都被勘察到了；尽管它的直径有2,150英里，面积为地球的十五分之一，体积也有地球的四十九分之一——但它的任何秘密都逃不过天文学家的眼睛；而且，这些能干的科学家们还得出了更为惊人的观测结果。","At length, thanks to modern art, instruments of still higher perfection searched the moon without intermission, not leaving a single point of her surface unexplored; and notwithstanding that her diameter measures 2,150 miles, her surface equals the one-fifteenth part of that of our globe, and her bulk the one-forty-ninth part of that of the terrestrial spheroid—not one of her secrets was able to escape the eyes of the astronomers; and these skillful men of science carried to an even greater degree their prodigious observations."
"譬如，他们注意到，在满月的时候，月盘的某些部位会出现白色的线条；其他相位时，则会出现黑色的线条。经过一番更细致的研究，他们终于对这些线条的出现作出了准确的解释。它们是一条条平行的山脊之间形成的细长的沟壑，这些沟壑通常一直延伸到陨石坑的边缘。这些沟壑的长度从10英里到100英里不等，宽约1,600码。天文学家称它们为“陷窟”，但他们所能弄清的也只有这些了。至于这些沟壑是不是干涸的古代河床，他们还无法完全确定。","Thus they remarked that, during full moon, the disc appeared scored in certain parts with white lines; and, during the phases, with black.On prosecuting the study of these with still greater precision, they succeeded in obtaining an exact account of the nature of these lines.They were long and narrow furrows sunk between parallel ridges, bordering generally upon the edges of the craters.Their length varied between ten and 100 miles, and their width was about 1,600 yards.Astronomers called them chasms, but they could not get any further.Whether these chasms were the dried-up beds of ancient rivers or not they were unable thoroughly to ascertain."
"和其他国家的人们一样，美国人也希望有一天他们能够彻底解决这一地质学问题。他们也开始对月球表面的平行壁垒进行探究；这些壁垒最初是被慕尼黑一位博学的教授克利杜伊逊发现的，他认为，这些壁垒是“月球上的工程师修建的防御工事”。毫无疑问，这两点，还有其他的一系列问题，只有等人类与月球取得直接联系之后才能得到解决。","The Americans, among others, hoped one day or other to determine this geological question.They also undertook to examine the true nature of that system of parallel ramparts discovered on the moon’s surface by Gruithuysen, a learned professor of Munich, who considered them to be “a system of fortifications thrown up by the Selenitic engineers.” These two points, yet obscure, as well as others, no doubt, could not be definitely settled except by direct communication with the moon."
"至于月光强度的问题，已经得到了彻底解决。我们都知道，月光强度只有阳光强度的三十万分之一，而且，它所产生的热度体现在温度计上也是微乎其微。至于我们所说的“灰光现象”，自然可以解释为是由地球反射到月球的太阳光线所致的，正是这些光线的作用，使得月球在月中呈圆盘状，每逢月初和月末又呈月牙状。","Regarding the degree of intensity of its light, there was nothing more to learn on this point.It was known that it is 300,000 times weaker than that of the sun, and that its heat has no appreciable effect upon the thermometer.As to the phenomenon known as the “ashy light,” it is explained naturally by the effect of the transmission of the solar rays from the earth to the moon, which give the appearance of completeness to the lunar disc, while it presents itself under the crescent form during its first and last phases."
"以上就是当时人们所知的关于地球卫星的全部知识，而枪炮俱乐部的会员们就打算在此基础上，从宇宙学、地质学、政治学和伦理学的角度对其进行完善。","Such was the state of knowledge acquired regarding the earth’s satellite, which the Gun Club undertook to perfect in all its aspects, cosmographic, geological, political, and moral."
"第六章 美国的信仰极限和无知极限","CHAPTER VI PERMISSIVE LIMITS OF IGNORANCE AND BELIEF IN THE UNITED STATES"
"巴比康的提议的直接结果是，所有有关夜之女王——月亮的天文事实一时间风靡起来。每个人都开始专心致志地从事研究月亮的工作。仿佛月亮还是第一次出现，以前从没有人在天上看到过月亮。所有关于“狼的太阳”的古老轶事，又重新登上了报纸，这些轶事使人们回想起，在过去的蒙昧时代里，他们曾将各种影响力归功于月亮。简而言之，所有的美国人都患上了“月亮狂躁症“，或者说，他们对月亮已是如痴如狂。","The immediate result of Barbicane’s proposition was to place upon the orders of the day all the astronomical facts relative to the Queen of the Night.Everybody set to work to study assiduously.One would have thought that the moon had just appeared for the first time, and that no one had ever before caught a glimpse of her in the heavens.The papers revived all the old anecdotes in which the “sun of the wolves” played a part; they recalled the influences which the ignorance of past ages ascribed to her; in short, all America was seized with selenomania, or had become moon-mad."
"至于一些科学期刊，则特别解决了一些涉及到枪炮俱乐部的计划的问题。他们公布了来自剑桥天文台的信，并对其进行了毫无保留的肯定。","The scientific journals, for their part, dealt more especially with the questions which touched upon the enterprise of the Gun Club.The letter of the Observatory of Cambridge was published by them, and commented upon with unreserved approval."
"直到那时，大多数人还是对计算月亮到地球距离的方法一无所知。他们借此机会向人们解释，这个距离是通过测量月球的视差而得到的。由于普通人很难理解“视差”这个高深的术语，他们又进一步解释说，“视差”指的是从地球半径的两端到月球的两条直线相交构成的角。如果人们怀疑这个方法的正确性，那么他们不但会立即证明地球到月球的平均距离是234,347英里，而且还会证明，天文学家们的计算误差不可能超过七十英里。","Until that time most people had been ignorant of the mode in which the distance which separates the moon from the earth is calculated.They took advantage of this fact to explain to them that this distance was obtained by measuring the parallax of the moon.The term parallax proving “caviare to the general,” they further explained that it meant the angle formed by the inclination of two straight lines drawn from either extremity of the earth’s radius to the moon.On doubts being expressed as to the correctness of this method, they immediately proved that not only was the mean distance 234,347 miles, but that astronomers could not possibly be in error in their estimate by more than seventy miles either way."
"他们向那些不熟悉月球运动的人解释，月球有两种不同的运动，第一种是绕着自身的轴线旋转，第二种是绕着地球旋转。这两种运动是在同一时间段内完成的，也就是说，是在二十七又三分之一天内完成的。","To those who were not familiar with the motions of the moon, they demonstrated that she possesses two distinct motions, the first being that of rotation upon her axis, the second being that of revolution round the earth, accomplishing both together in an equal period of time, that is to say, in twenty-seven and one-third days."
"由于月球的自转，其表面产生了日和夜；只不过在一个朔望月中，月球上只有一个白天和一个夜晚，各持续三百五十四又三分之一小时。但是，幸运的是，月球朝向地球的那一面被地球照亮，这光亮的强度是月光强度的十四倍。至于我们始终看不到的月球另一面，则一定有354小时的绝对黑夜，只能见到“从星星上洒落的苍白的光”。","The motion of rotation is that which produces day and night on the surface of the moon; save that there is only one day and one night in the lunar month, each lasting three hundred and fifty-four and one-third hours.But, happily for her, the face turned toward the terrestrial globe is illuminated by it with an intensity equal to that of fourteen moons.As to the other face, always invisible to us, it has of necessity three hundred and fifty-four hours of absolute night, tempered only by that “pale glimmer which falls upon it from the stars.”"
"一些好心但相当固执的人们，一开始会很难理解——既然公转的时候，月球总是以同一面朝向地球，那它怎么算是自转了一周？对于这一疑问，他们的回答是：“你可以走进餐厅，环绕桌子行走，并且脸要始终朝向桌子的中心。当你环绕桌子走完完整的一圈之后，你也以自身为轴旋转了一周，因为你的眼睛已经相继看到了屋子的每个角落。好啦，房间就是天空，桌子就是地球，月亮就是你自己。”然后他们愉快地走了。","Some well-intentioned, but rather obstinate persons, could not at first comprehend how, if the moon displays invariably the same face to the earth during her revolution, she can describe one turn round herself.To such they answered, “Go into your dining-room, and walk round the table in such a way as to always keep your face turned toward the center; by the time you will have achieved one complete round you will have completed one turn around yourself, since your eye will have traversed successively every point of the room.Well, then, the room is the heavens, the table is the earth, and the moon is yourself.” And they would go away delighted."
"所以说，月球总是以同一面朝向地球，但是，为了更加精确起见，有必要补充一点：由于某些朝着东南西北各个方向的波动——我们把这种波动称为”天平动“，我们可以看到月球的一半还多，即差不多七分之五。　","So, then the moon displays invariably the same face to the earth; nevertheless, to be quite exact, it is necessary to add that, in consequence of certain fluctuations of north and south, and of west and east, termed her libration, she permits rather more than half, that is to say, five-sevenths, to be seen."
"当那些无知的人们对月球自转的了解开始和天文台主任的一样多的时候，他们又操心起月球围绕地球的公转来，于是，马上出现了20篇科学评论来解释这一问题。他们解释道，布满无数星星的天空可以被看作一个巨大的表盘，月球在这个表盘上运行，向地球上的所有居民们指示着准确的时间。夜之女王——月亮正是在这种运动的过程中显现出不同的月相：当月球面对太阳时，月亮为满月，此时，三个天体在同一直线上，地球占据中心的位置；当月球背对太阳的时候，月亮为新月，此时，月球处于太阳和地球之间；最后，当月球占据顶点并与太阳和地球形成一定夹角时，月亮为上弦月或下弦月。","As soon as the ignoramuses came to understand as much as the director of the observatory himself knew, they began to worry themselves regarding her revolution round the earth, whereupon twenty scientific reviews immediately came to the rescue.They pointed out to them that the firmament, with its infinitude of stars, may be considered as one vast dialplate, upon which the moon travels, indicating the true time to all the inhabitants of the earth; that it is during this movement that the Queen of Night exhibits her different phases; that the moon is full when she is in opposition with the sun, that is when the three bodies are on the same straight line, the earth occupying the center; that she is new when she is in conjunction with the sun, that is, when she is between it and the earth; and, lastly that she is in her first or last quarter, when she makes with the sun and the earth an angle of which she herself occupies the apex."
"关于月亮在地平线以上所能达到的海拔高度这个问题，剑桥天文台的信已经解释得再详尽不过了。每个人都知道，这一海拔高度会随着观察者所处纬度的变化而变化。但在地球上，月亮唯一能够经过天顶——即观测者正上方——的区域，在南北纬二十八度和赤道之间。因此，将实验安排在地球这一区域的某一点进行，这是一个很重要的建议，其目的是使炮弹能够垂直地发射出去，并在最短的时间内摆脱万有引力的作用。这是实验获得成功的一个必不可少的条件，一直吸引着公众的密切注意。","Regarding the altitude which the moon attains above the horizon, the letter of the Cambridge Observatory had said all that was to be said in this respect.Every one knew that this altitude varies according to the latitude of the observer.But the only zones of the globe in which the moon passes the zenith, that is, the point directly over the head of the spectator, are of necessity comprised between the twenty-eighth parallels and the equator.Hence the importance of the advice to try the experiment upon some point of that part of the globe, in order that the projectile might be discharged perpendicularly, and so the soonest escape the action of gravitation.This was an essential condition to the success of the enterprise, and continued actively to engage the public attention."
"至于月球围绕地球旋转的轨道这一问题，剑桥天文台证明这一轨道是一条闭合曲线——不是一个圆，而是一个椭圆，地球占据了其中的一个焦点。同样容易理解的是，当月球处于远地点时，它距离地球最远，处于近地点时，距离地球最近。","Regarding the path described by the moon in her revolution round the earth, the Cambridge Observatory had demonstrated that this path is a re-entering curve, not a perfect circle, but an ellipse, of which the earth occupies one of the foci.It was also well understood that it is farthest removed from the earth during its apogee, and approaches most nearly to it at its perigee."
"当时，关于这一问题，每一个美国人都对这些知识了如指掌，如果有人竟然说自己不懂这些，那绝对是件丢面子的事。然而，虽然这些原理迅速传播开来，但很多错误的想法和无缘无故的恐惧还是一时间难以根除。","Such was then the extent of knowledge possessed by every American on the subject, and of which no one could decently profess ignorance.Still, while these principles were being rapidly disseminated many errors and illusory fears proved less easy to eradicate."
"比如，一些知名人士坚持认为，月球是古代的一颗彗星，沿着狭长的轨道环绕太阳运行，当其经过地球附近的时候，就会被地球的引力圈所吸引。这些纸上谈兵的天文学家们自称要解释月蚀现象——说这种灾难现象要归因于太阳的强大热量，但当人们提醒他们，彗星有大气层，而月亮却几乎没有、或者说完全没有大气层，他们就一片茫然，不知如何作答了。","For instance, some worthy persons maintained that the moon was an ancient comet which, in describing its elongated orbit round the sun, happened to pass near the earth, and became confined within her circle of attraction.These drawing-room astronomers professed to explain the charred aspect of the moon—a disaster which they attributed to the intensity of the solar heat; only, on being reminded that comets have an atmosphere, and that the moon has little or none, they were fairly at a loss for a reply."
"还有一些同样持怀疑态度的人们，对月球的位置表现出某些恐惧。他们听说，根据哈里发时代所做的观察记录，月球的公转速度已经在一定程度上有所提高。因此，他们得出一个相当符合逻辑的结论：随着月球运行速度加快，两个天体之间的距离应当也会相应缩减；如果这种双重效应继续发展到无限大，那么总有一天，月球会坠落到地球上。　但是，当他们得知，根据拉普拉斯的计算，这一运行速度的加快是在很小的范围之内的，以后还必定会以一定的比例减慢，他们就不再担心未来几代人的命运了。所以，在未来很长一段时期内，太阳系的稳定性都不会被打乱。","Others again, belonging to the doubting class, expressed certain fears as to the position of the moon.They had heard it said that, according to observations made in the time of the Caliphs, her revolution had become accelerated in a certain degree.Hence they concluded, logically enough, that an acceleration of motion ought to be accompanied by a corresponding diminution in the distance separating the two bodies; and that, supposing the double effect to be continued to infinity, the moon would end by one day falling into the earth.However, they became reassured as to the fate of future generations on being apprised that, according to the calculations of Laplace, this acceleration of motion is confined within very restricted limits, and that a proportional diminution of speed will be certain to succeed it.So, then, the stability of the solar system would not be deranged in ages to come."
"还有一些人属于第三类：迷信的人。这些“伟人”们不会满足于自己的无知，他们必须知道一些根本不存在的东西，至于月球，他们早就对它了如指掌了。有人把月亮那扁平的圆面当作一面锃明瓦亮的镜子，通过这面镜子，人们可以从地球上的不同位置看到彼此，还可以相互交流思想。还有人伪称，在1,000个已被观测的新月中，有950个都会引起灾难、革命、地震、洪水等显著的干扰事件。这样一来，他们便认为是月球利用某种神秘的力量影响着人类的命运——每一个月球人都与一个地球居民通过心灵感应联系在一起，他们坚持认为整个生命系统都受到月亮的控制，云云。但是，大多数人及时摒弃了这些粗鄙的错误，站到了真理的一边。对于美国佬来说，他们唯一的野心就是占领这片新天地，并把美利坚合众国的星条旗插在月球的最高点，除此之外，别无他求。","There remains but the third class, the superstitious.These worthies were not content merely to rest in ignorance; they must know all about things which had no existence whatever, and as to the moon, they had long known all about her.One set regarded her disc as a polished mirror, by means of which people could see each other from different points of the earth and interchange their thoughts.Another set pretended that out of one thousand new moons that had been observed, nine hundred and fifty had been attended with remarkable disturbances, such as cataclysms, revolutions, earthquakes, the deluge, etc. Then they believed in some mysterious influence exercised by her over human destinies—that every Selenite was attached to some inhabitant of the earth by a tie of sympathy; they maintained that the entire vital system is subject to her control, etc. But in time the majority renounced these vulgar errors, and espoused the true side of the question.As for the Yankees, they had no other ambition than to take possession of this new continent of the sky, and to plant upon the summit of its highest elevation the star-spangled banner of the United States of America."

"“先生们，”他说，“我们不得不解决整个高尚的枪炮制造学中一个最重要的问题。也许，第一次会议应该讨论使用何种引擎，这样显得最符合逻辑。但是，经过深思熟虑后，我觉得炮弹的问题必须放在大炮之前，并且大炮的体积必须视炮弹的体积而定。”","“Gentlemen,” said he, “we have to resolve one of the most important problems in the whole of the noble science of gunnery.It might appear, perhaps, the most logical course to devote our first meeting to the discussion of the engine to be employed.Nevertheless, after mature consideration, it has appeared to me that the question of the projectile must take precedence of that of the cannon, and that the dimensions of the latter must necessarily depend on those of the former.”"
"“容我说句话。”J. T. 马斯顿插嘴道，“先生们，”得到允许后，他用颇受鼓舞的腔调说道，“我们的主席把炮弹的问题放在所有问题之首，这一做法是正确的。我们即将向月球发射的这颗炮弹就好比地球向月球派遣的大使，我希望我们能从道德的角度去考虑这一问题。先生们，在我看来，炮弹是人类力量最伟大的体现。如果是上天创造了恒星和行星，那么是人类创造了炮弹。如果说，是上天创造了电、光、恒星、彗星、行星、风和声音所拥有的迅捷的速度——那么，是我们赋予了炮弹迅捷的速度，这一速度比最快的骏马或飞驰的火车都要快上一百倍。当我们大大超越一切已有的速度极限，以每秒七英里的速度发射新炮弹时，那将会是一个多么光荣的时刻啊！先生们，作为地球人的使者，这枚炮弹抵达月球后怎能不受到热烈欢迎呢？”","“Suffer me to say a word,” here broke in J. T. Maston.Permission having been granted, “Gentlemen,” said he with an inspired accent, “our president is right in placing the question of the projectile above all others.The ball we are about to discharge at the moon is our ambassador to her, and I wish to consider it from a moral point of view.The cannon-ball, gentlemen, to my mind, is the most magnificent manifestation of human power.If Providence has created the stars and the planets, man has called the cannon-ball into existence.Let Providence claim the swiftness of electricity and of light, of the stars, the comets, and the planets, of wind and sound— we claim to have invented the swiftness of the cannon-ball, a hundred times superior to that of the swiftest horses or railway train.How glorious will be the moment when, infinitely exceeding all hitherto attained velocities, we shall launch our new projectile with the rapidity of seven miles a second!Shall it not, gentlemen—shall it not be received up there with the honors due to a terrestrial ambassador?”"
"他控制住情绪，坐了下来，把注意力集中在他面前的一大碟三明治上。","Overcome with emotion the orator sat down and applied himself to a huge plate of sandwiches before him."
"“现在，”巴比康说，“我们不要总唱赞美诗了，请直接切题。”","“And now,” said Barbicane, “let us quit the domain of poetry and come direct to the question.”"
"“没问题。”会员们回答道，每个人的嘴里都塞满了三明治。","“By all means,” replied the members, each with his mouth full of sandwich."
"“摆在我们面前的问题，”主席继续说道，“是如何使炮弹的速度达到每秒12,000码。现在，让我们回顾一下迄今为止所达到的速度记录。摩根将军将就这一点为我们进行说明。”","“The problem before us,” continued the president, “is how to communicate to a projectile a velocity of 12,000 yards per second.Let us at present examine the velocities hitherto attained.General Morgan will be able to enlighten us on this point.”"
"“这太容易了，”将军答道，“战争期间我是实验委员会的成员之一。那时，重100磅的达尔格伦大炮射程是5,000码，其炮弹的初速度为每秒500码。罗德曼的哥伦比亚大炮曾发射了一颗半吨重、射程六英里、速度每秒800码的炮弹，这一成绩是英国的阿姆斯特朗和帕利瑟从未取得的。","“And the more easily,” replied the general, “that during the war I was a member of the committee of experiments.I may say, then, that the 100-pounder Dahlgrens, which carried a distance of 5,000 yards, impressed upon their projectile an initial velocity of 500 yards a second.The Rodman Columbiad threw a shot weighing half a ton a distance of six miles, with a velocity of 800 yards per second— a result which Armstrong and Palisser have never obtained in England.”"
"“这，”巴比康说，“我认为就是曾达到的最高速度吧？“","“This,” replied Barbicane, “is, I believe, the maximum velocity ever attained?”"
"“是这样的。”将军回答。","“It is so,” replied the general."
"“啊！”J. T. 马斯顿叹了口气说，“要是我的迫击炮没爆炸的话——“","“Ah!” groaned J. T. Maston, “if my mortar had not burst——”"
"“是的，”巴比康平静地答道，“但它确实爆炸了。那么，我们必须从这个800码的速度入手。我们必须让它成为原来的20倍。现在，让我们把产生这一速度的方法留到下次会议讨论，我们接下来要探讨炮弹应该多大合适。要知道，我们可决不能使用那些最多不过半吨重的炮弹。”","“Yes,” quietly replied Barbicane, “but it did burst.We must take, then, for our starting point, this velocity of 800 yards.We must increase it twenty-fold.Now, reserving for another discussion the means of producing this velocity, I will call your attention to the dimensions which it will be proper to assign to the shot.You understand that we have nothing to do here with projectiles weighing at most but half a ton.”"
"“为什么不能呢？”少校问道。","“Why not?” demanded the major."
"“因为炮弹一定要够大，”J. T. 马斯顿马上答道，“这样才能吸引月球上居民们的注意——如果月球上真的有人的话。”","“Because the shot,” quickly replied J. T. Maston, “must be big enough to attract the attention of the inhabitants of the moon, if there are any?”"
"“是的，”巴比康答道，“不过还有一个更重要的原因。”","“Yes,” replied Barbicane, “and for another reason more important still.”"
"“这话什么意思？”少校问道。","“What mean you?” asked the major."
"“我的意思是，发射炮弹后就再也不管它了，这样是远远不够的，我们必须对它进行全程跟进，直到它达到目的地的那一刻。”","“I mean that it is not enough to discharge a projectile, and then take no further notice of it; we must follow it throughout its course, up to the moment when it shall reach its goal.”"
"“什么？”将军和少校惊奇地叫道。","“What?” shouted the general and the major in great surprise."
"“毫无疑问，”巴比康沉着地说，“不然我们的实验将无法产生结果。”","“Undoubtedly,” replied Barbicane composedly, “or our experiment would produce no result.”"
"“那么，”少校答道，“这颗炮弹的体积必须得很大了。”","“But then,” replied the major, “you will have to give this projectile enormous dimensions.”"
"“不！请好好听我说。你们知道，光学仪器已经做得非常完美了；通过某些仪器，我们可以成功地将某个物体放大6,000倍，并将月球的距离缩短到40英里以内。现在，从这个距离绝对能看见任何60英尺宽的物体。","“No! Be so good as to listen.You know that optical instruments have acquired great perfection; with certain instruments we have succeeded in obtaining enlargements of 6,000 times and reducing the moon to within forty miles’ distance.Now, at this distance, any objects sixty feet square would be perfectly visible."
"“那么，我们之所以没有进一步提高望远镜的穿透力，是因为那样会降低它们的亮度；而仅仅作为反射镜的月球，也不能反射足够的光，使我们看清更小的物体。”","“If, then, the penetrative power of telescopes has not been further increased, it is because that power detracts from their light; and the moon, which is but a reflecting mirror, does not give back sufficient light to enable us to perceive objects of lesser magnitude.”"
"“那么，你有什么建议？”将军问道，“你能使炮弹的直径达到60英尺吗？”","“Well, then, what do you propose to do?” asked the general.“Would you give your projectile a diameter of sixty feet?”"
"“不用这样。”","“Not so.”"
"“那么，你打算增加月球的亮度吗？”","“Do you intend, then, to increase the luminous power of the moon?”"
"“正是如此。如果我能成功地降低月光必须穿过的大气层的密度，我想月光就会变得更亮。为了达到这一目标，我们将在一些高山上安装望远镜。那就是我们将要做的。”","“Exactly so.If I can succeed in diminishing the density of the atmosphere through which the moon’s light has to travel I shall have rendered her light more intense.To effect that object it will be enough to establish a telescope on some elevated mountain.That is what we will do.”"
"“我甘拜下风，”少校回答道，“你竟有这么一个简化问题的方法。那么，通过这种方法，你想将月球放大多少倍呢？”","“I give it up,” answered the major.“You have such a way of simplifying things.And what enlargement do you expect to obtain in this way?”"
"“放大48,000倍，这样一来，就能把月球的视觉距离控制在五英里以内，而且，物体的直径只需达到九英尺，就能被看见。”","“One of 48,000 times, which should bring the moon within an apparent distance of five miles; and, in order to be visible, objects need not have a diameter of more than nine feet.”"
"“所以，”J. T. 马斯顿叫道，“我们的炮弹直径只需达到九英尺即可。”","“So, then,” cried J. T. Maston, “our projectile need not be more than nine feet in diameter.”"
"“但是，要我说，”埃尔芬斯通少校插嘴道，“这样炮弹的重量就会达到——”","“Let me observe, however,” interrupted Major Elphinstone, “this will involve a weight such as——”"
"“我亲爱的少校，”巴比康说道，“在讨论它的重量之前，请允许我列举我们的祖先曾在这一领域创造的一些奇迹。我并不是说枪炮制造学没有进步，但是，我们应该记住，他们在中世纪所取得的成果，我敢说比我们的更加令人惊叹。比如说，在1453年穆罕默德二世围攻君士坦丁堡期间，人们使用了重1,900磅的石炮弹。在骑士时代的马耳他，圣埃尔莫堡垒有一门大炮曾经发射了一颗两千五百磅重的炮弹。那么，现在，我们认为我们自己能做到什么程度呢？阿姆斯特朗大炮发射了重五百磅的炮弹，罗德曼大炮发射了重半吨的炮弹！似乎炮弹的射程一旦提高，重量就会大大减轻。现在，如果我们朝着这一方向努力，凭借科学的进步，我们应该能让穆罕默德二世和马耳他骑士的炮弹再重十倍。","“My dear major,” replied Barbicane, “before discussing its weight permit me to enumerate some of the marvels which our ancestors have achieved in this respect.I don’t mean to pretend that the science of gunnery has not advanced, but it is as well to bear in mind that during the middle ages they obtained results more surprising, I will venture to say, than ours.For instance, during the siege of Constantinople by Mahomet II., in 1453, stone shot of 1,900 pounds weight were employed.At Malta, in the time of the knights, there was a gun of the fortress of St. Elmo which threw a projectile weighing 2,500 pounds.And, now, what is the extent of what we have seen ourselves?Armstrong guns discharging shot of 500 pounds, and the Rodman guns projectiles of half a ton!It seems, then, that if projectiles have gained in range, they have lost far more in weight.Now, if we turn our efforts in that direction, we ought to arrive, with the progress on science, at ten times the weight of the shot of Mahomet II. and the Knights of Malta.”"
"“讲得很清楚，”少校回答说；“但是你打算用什么金属来造炮弹呢？”","“Clearly,” replied the major; “but what metal do you calculate upon employing?”"
"“铸铁就行啊。”摩根将军说。","“Simply cast iron,” said General Morgan."
"“但是，”少校打断他，“由于炮弹的重量和它的体积是成比例的，一颗直径九英尺的铸铁炮弹将会重得惊人。”","“But,” interrupted the major, “since the weight of a shot is proportionate to its volume, an iron ball of nine feet in diameter would be of tremendous weight.”"
"“如果炮弹是实心的，就会很重，但如果是空心的，就不会太重了。”","“Yes, if it were solid, not if it were hollow.”"
"“空心？那不就成弹壳了？”","“Hollow? then it would be a shell?”"
"“是的，就是弹壳。”巴比康回答说；“炮弹一定得是空心的。一个208英寸的实心炮弹重量会超过20万磅，很明显太重了。然而，由于我们必须保证我们的炮弹具有一定稳定性，所以我建议让它重20,000磅。”","“Yes, a shell,” replied Barbicane; “decidely it must be. A solid shot of 108 inches would weigh more than 200,000 pounds, a weight evidently far too great.Still, as we must reserve a certain stability for our projectile, I propose to give it a weight of 20,000 pounds.”"
"“那么，炮弹壁的厚度是多少呢？”少校问道。","“What, then, will be the thickness of the sides?” asked the major."
"“如果按照通常的比例，”摩根回答说，“直径108英寸的炮弹需要差不多两英尺厚的内壁。”","“If we follow the usual proportion,” replied Morgan, “a diameter of 108 inches would require sides of two feet thickness, or less.”"
"“那太厚啦，”巴比康说；“要知道，现在的问题不是让炮弹射穿铁板，只要它的内壁能承受大气的压力就足够了。因此，现在的问题是——为了使重量不超过两万磅，铸铁弹壳的厚度应该是多少呢？我们聪明的秘书很快就会告诉我们的。”","“That would be too much,” replied Barbicane; “for you will observe that the question is not that of a shot intended to pierce an iron plate; it will suffice to give it sides strong enough to resist the pressure of the gas. The problem, therefore, is this— What thickness ought a cast-iron shell to have in order not to weight more than 20,000 pounds?Our clever secretary will soon enlighten us upon this point.”"
"“再简单不过了。”委员会那令人尊敬的秘书说。然后，他迅速在纸上写下了一些代数公式，在这些公式中，ｎ的二次幂和ｘ的二次幂频频出现。接着他说：","“Nothing easier.” replied the worthy secretary of the committee; and, rapidly tracing a few algebraical formulae upon paper, among which n^2 and x^2 frequently appeared, he presently said:"
"“弹壁的厚度不能大于两英寸。”","“The sides will require a thickness of less than two inches.”"
"“这样够吗？”少校半信半疑地问道。","“Will that be enough?” asked the major doubtfully."
"“明显不够！”主席回答说。","“Clearly not!” replied the president."
"“那该怎么办呢？”埃尔芬斯通疑惑地问道。","“What is to be done, then?” said Elphinstone, with a puzzled air."
"“用另一种金属代替铁。”","“Employ another metal instead of iron.”"
"“铜？”摩根说。","“Copper?” said Morgan."
"“不！太重了。我有更好的材料。”","“No! that would be too heavy.I have better than that to offer.”"
"“那是什么呢？”少校问道。","“What then?” asked the major."
"“铝！”巴比康回答说。","“Aluminum!” replied Barbicane."
"“铝？”三位同事一齐叫道。","“Aluminum?” cried his three colleagues in chorus."
"“当然，我的朋友们。这种珍贵的金属如银一般白亮，如金一般牢固，如铁一般坚韧，如铜一般易于熔化，如玻璃一般光亮。它易于锻造，分布广泛，是大多数岩石的主要成分，重量是铁的三分之一。上天创造铝，仿佛就是专门为了给我们制造炮弹提供材料的。”","“Unquestionably, my friends.This valuable metal possesses the whiteness of silver, the indestructibility of gold, the tenacity of iron, the fusibility of copper, the lightness of glass.It is easily wrought, is very widely distributed, forming the base of most of the rocks, is three times lighter than iron, and seems to have been created for the express purpose of furnishing us with the material for our projectile.”"
"“但是，我亲爱的主席，”少校说，“铝的价格不是很贵吗？”","“But, my dear president,” said the major, “is not the cost price of aluminum extremely high?”"
"“刚被发现时，它的价格很昂贵，但是现在已经跌到了每磅九美元。”","“It was so at its first discovery, but it has fallen now to nine dollars a pound.”"
"“但是，九美元一磅啊！”少校不想让步；“这个价格还是太昂贵了。”","“But still, nine dollars a pound!” replied the major, who was not willing readily to give in; “even that is an enormous price.”"
"“确实很昂贵，我亲爱的少校；但是我们能够承受得起。”","“Undoubtedly, my dear major; but not beyond our reach.”"
"“这样，炮弹会有多重啊？”摩根问道。","“What will the projectile weigh then?” asked Morgan."
"“这就是我的计算结果，”巴比康回答道，“我们的铸铁炮弹直径为108英寸，厚度为12英寸，重量为67,400磅。如果用铝作为材料的话，它的重量就只有1,9250磅了。”","“Here is the result of my calculations,” replied Barbicane.“A shot of 108 inches in diameter, and twelve inches in thickness, would weigh, in cast-iron, 67,440 pounds; cast in aluminum, its weight will be reduced to 19,250 pounds.”"
"“太好啦！”少校大声说道；“但是，你们知道吗，如果以每磅九美元的价格来计算，那么这颗炮弹将会花费——”","“Capital!” cried the major; “but do you know that, at nine dollars a pound, this projectile will cost——”"
"“173,050美元。我很清楚。但是，不要害怕，我的朋友们，我们的事业是不会缺少资金的。我将对此负责。现在，你们认为用铝作材料怎么样，先生们？”","“One hundred and seventy-three thousand and fifty dollars ($173,050).I know it quite well.But fear not, my friends; the money will not be wanting for our enterprise.I will answer for it.Now what say you to aluminum, gentlemen?”"
"“通过！”委员会的三个成员回答说。就这样，第一次会议结束了。炮弹的问题已经明确地解决了。","“Adopted!” replied the three members of the committee.So ended the first meeting.The question of the projectile was definitely settled."
"第八章 大炮的历史","CHAPTER VIII HISTORY OF THE CANNON"
"上次会议通过的决议对外界产生了巨大的影响。胆小的人们一想到要把一枚重达20,000磅的炮弹发射升空，就觉得害怕，他们怀疑怎样的大炮才能给这样的庞然大物提供足够的速度。第二次会议的记录注定会成功地回答这些问题。第二天晚上，讨论重新开始。","The resolutions passed at the last meeting produced a great effect out of doors.Timid people took fright at the idea of a shot weighing 20,000 pounds being launched into space; they asked what cannon could ever transmit a sufficient velocity to such a mighty mass.The minutes of the second meeting were destined triumphantly to answer such questions.The following evening the discussion was renewed."
"“我亲爱的同事们，”巴比康没有作太多的铺垫，直接说道，“现在，摆在我们面前的议题是大炮的建造问题，这涉及到它的长度、构造、和重量。讨论的结果很可能是大炮的体积将会非常大，但无论前路多艰难，我们的机械天才们都会轻而易举地克服困难。下面，请把你们的注意力集中在我这里，如有反对意见，请毫不犹豫地提出。我不怕反对意见。摆在我们面前的问题是，如何使直径108英寸、重20,000磅的弹壳拥有每秒12,000码的初始速度。那么，当弹炮发射升空时，它会怎么样呢？它将受到三种独立的力量的影响：空气阻力、地球引力和我们给予它的冲力。我们就来研究一下这三种力吧。空气阻力不是很重要。地球大气层的厚度不会超过40英里。这样，凭借给定的速度，炮弹用五分钟就能穿过大气层，由于时间很短暂，所以空气这一媒质的阻力可以被看作是微不足道的。那么，接下来让我们研究一下地球引力，也就是弹壳的重量，我们知道这个重量与距离的平方成反比，距离增加，重量相应减小。当一个物体向着地球表面自由下落，第一秒内将下落五英尺；但如果同一个物体被移到257,542英里以外，换句话说，也就是移到月球那么远，那么它第一秒内只会下落二十四分之一英寸。这几乎就等同于静止不动。因此，我们的任务就是逐步克服这一引力。完成这一任务的方法就是靠冲力。”","“My dear colleagues,” said Barbicane, without further preamble, “the subject now before us is the construction of the engine, its length, its composition, and its weight.It is probable that we shall end by giving it gigantic dimensions; but however great may be the difficulties in the way, our mechanical genius will readily surmount them.Be good enough, then, to give me your attention, and do not hesitate to make objections at the close.I have no fear of them.The problem before us is how to communicate an initial force of 12,000 yards per second to a shell of 108 inches in diameter, weighing 20,000 pounds.Now when a projectile is launched into space, what happens to it?It is acted upon by three independent forces: the resistance of the air, the attraction of the earth, and the force of impulsion with which it is endowed.Let us examine these three forces.The resistance of the air is of little importance.The atmosphere of the earth does not exceed forty miles.Now, with the given rapidity, the projectile will have traversed this in five seconds, and the period is too brief for the resistance of the medium to be regarded otherwise than as insignificant.Proceding, then, to the attraction of the earth, that is, the weight of the shell, we know that this weight will diminish in the inverse ratio of the square of the distance.When a body left to itself falls to the surface of the earth, it falls five feet in the first second; and if the same body were removed 257,542 miles further off, in other words, to the distance of the moon, its fall would be reduced to about half a line in the first second.That is almost equivalent to a state of perfect rest.Our business, then, is to overcome progressively this action of gravitation.The mode of accomplishing that is by the force of impulsion.”"
"“这就是困难所在。”少校插言道。","“There’s the difficulty,” broke in the major."
"“的确，”主席说；“但是我们会克服困难，因为冲力取决于炮身的长度和所使用的火药，而后者又仅受前者反冲力的限制。那么，我们今天的任务就是研究大炮体积的问题。”","“True,” replied the president; “but we will overcome that, for the force of impulsion will depend on the length of the engine and the powder employed, the latter being limited only by the resisting power of the former.Our business, then, today is with the dimensions of the cannon.”"
"“到现在为止，”巴比康说，“我们最长的炮身还没有超过25英尺。因此，我们即将制造的大炮的巨大体积将会使世人震惊。由于炮身加长，炮弹后累积的气体所受的阻滞就会加大，很明显，这样炮弹的射程将会很远；但是也不能超出一定限度。”","“Now, up to the present time,” said Barbicane, “our longest guns have not exceeded twenty-five feet in length.We shall therefore astonish the world by the dimensions we shall be obliged to adopt.It must evidently be, then, a gun of great range, since the length of the piece will increase the detention of the gas accumulated behind the projectile; but there is no advantage in passing certain limits.”"
"“是这样的。”少校说，“在这种情况下有什么规律可循呢？”","“Quite so,” said the major.“What is the rule in such a case?”"
"“通常，炮身的长度是炮弹直径的20到25五倍，重量是炮弹的235到240倍。”","“Ordinarily the length of a gun is twenty to twenty-five times the diameter of the shot, and its weight two hundred and thirty-five to two hundred and forty times that of the shot.”"
"“那远远不够。”急性子的J. T. 马斯顿叫道。","“That is not enough,” cried J. T. Maston impetuously."
"“我同意你的观点，我的好朋友；事实上，按照这个比例，对于一个直径九英尺、重30,000磅的炮弹来说，炮身只有225英尺长，7,200,000磅重。”","“I agree with you, my good friend; and, in fact, following this proportion for a projectile nine feet in diameter, weighing 30,000 pounds, the gun would only have a length of two hundred and twenty-five feet, and a weight of 7,200,000 pounds.”"
"“太可笑了！”马斯顿答道，“还不如用手枪呢。”","“Ridiculous!” rejoined Maston.“As well take a pistol.”"
"“我也是这样认为的，”巴比康回答说；“这就是为什么我建议把长度增加到原来的四倍，造一尊900英尺的大炮。”","“I think so too,” replied Barbicane; “that is why I propose to quadruple that length, and to construct a gun of nine hundred feet.”"
"将军和少校提出了一些反对的意见；但是，由于秘书的极力支持，提议最后还是被采纳了。","The general and the major offered some objections; nevertheless, the proposition, actively supported by the secretary, was definitely adopted."
"“但是，”埃尔芬斯通说，“它的厚度应该是多少呢？”","“But,” said Elphinstone, “what thickness must we give it?”"
"“六英尺厚。”巴比康回答说。","“A thickness of six feet,” replied Barbicane."
"“你不会真想把这么一个庞然大物放在炮架上吧？”少校问道。","“You surely don’t think of mounting a mass like that upon a carriage?” asked the major."
"“不过这倒是个极好的想法。”马斯顿说。","“It would be a superb idea, though,” said Maston."
"“但却不切实际。”巴比康说道，“我不打算把它放在炮架上，我想的是把炮身单独铸进地里，用熟铁圈绑好，最后再用厚厚的砖石和水泥把它围起来。炮身一旦铸好，一定要对炮膛进行仔细的打磨，避免任何游隙出现。这样就不会有任何气体的损失，火药的全部膨胀力都将用于推进炮弹。”","“But impracticable,” replied Barbicane.“No, I think of sinking this engine in the earth alone, binding it with hoops of wrought iron, and finally surrounding it with a thick mass of masonry of stone and cement.The piece once cast, it must be bored with great precision, so as to preclude any possible windage.So there will be no loss whatever of gas, and all the expansive force of the powder will be employed in the propulsion.”"
"“我有个简单的问题，”埃尔芬斯通说，“我们要在炮膛内加来复线吗？”","“One simple question,” said Elphinstone: “is our gun to be rifled?”"
"“不，当然不要，”巴比康说，“我们需要极大的初始速度，而你知道，炮弹从有来复线的炮膛中射出，其速度要比从平滑的炮膛中射出慢。”","“No, certainly not,” replied Barbicane; “we require an enormous initial velocity; and you are well aware that a shot quits a rifled gun less rapidly than it does a smooth-bore.”"
"“的确。”少校答道。","“True,” rejoined the major."
"下面是几分钟的休会时间，人们饮茶，吃三明治。","The committee here adjourned for a few minutes to tea and sandwiches."
"“先生们，”讨论刚一重新开始，巴比康就说道，“我们现在必须考虑一下使用哪种金属。我们的大炮必须是高韧性、高强度、耐高温、不易溶的，并且可以抵制酸类物质的腐蚀作用。”","On the discussion being renewed, “Gentlemen,” said Barbicane, “we must now take into consideration the metal to be employed.Our cannon must be possessed of great tenacity, great hardness, be infusible by heat, indissoluble, and inoxidable by the corrosive action of acids.”"
"“这一点是毫无疑问的。”少校说道，“由于我们所需要的金属相当之多，所以我们在选择的时候不能盲目。”","“There is no doubt about that,” replied the major; “and as we shall have to employ an immense quantity of metal, we shall not be at a loss for choice.”"
"“嗯，那么，”摩根说，“我建议使用我们迄今为止所知道的最好的合金，它由一百份铜、十二份锡和六份黄铜构成。”","“Well, then,” said Morgan, “I propose the best alloy hitherto known, which consists of one hundred parts of copper, twelve of tin, and six of brass.”"
"“我承认，”主席说，“这种合成物已经产出了极好的产品，但是，就目前的情况而言，这种合金的价格会很昂贵，并且也很难操作。因此，我认为，我们应该采用一种本身性能良好、并且价格低廉的材料，比如说铸铁。少校，你有什么意见？”","“I admit,” replied the president, “that this composition has yielded excellent results, but in the present case it would be too expensive, and very difficult to work.I think, then, that we ought to adopt a material excellent in its way and of low price, such as cast iron.What is your advice, major?”"
"“我非常同意你的观点。”埃尔芬斯通回答。","“I quite agree with you,” replied Elphinstone."
"“事实上，”巴比康继续说道，“铸铁的价格是青铜的十分之一，铸造起来很容易，在砂模中易于成型，便于操作，并且省时省钱。另外，它的确是很好的材料，我很清楚地记得在战争期间，在亚特兰大大围攻中，一些铸铁大炮每二十分钟就能发射一千发炮弹，并且完好无损。”","“In fact,” continued Barbicane, “cast iron costs ten times less than bronze; it is easy to cast, it runs readily from the moulds of sand, it is easy of manipulation, it is at once economical of money and of time.In addition, it is excellent as a material, and I well remember that during the war, at the siege of Atlanta, some iron guns fired one thousand rounds at intervals of twenty minutes without injury.”"
"“可是，铸铁太脆了。”摩根说。","“Cast iron is very brittle, though,” replied Morgan."
"“不错，可它有极强的抗性。现在我要让我们令人尊敬的秘书来计算一下，一尊炮膛长九英尺、膛壁厚六英尺的铸铁大炮的重量。”","“Yes, but it possesses great resistance.I will now ask our worthy secretary to calculate the weight of a cast-iron gun with a bore of nine feet and a thickness of six feet of metal.”"
"“一会儿就好。”马斯顿说道。然后，他极其熟练地匆匆写下一些代数公式，接着很快便宣布了下面的结果：","“In a moment,” replied Maston.Then, dashing off some algebraical formulae with marvelous facility, in a minute or two he declared the following result:"
"“大炮的重量为68,040吨。那么按每磅两美分计算，需要花费——”","“The cannon will weigh 68,040 tons.And, at two cents a pound, it will cost——”"
"“2,510,701美元。”","“Two million five hundred and ten thousand seven hundred and one dollars.”"
"马斯顿、少校和将军都用不安的眼神看着巴比康。","Maston, the major, and the general regarded Barbicane with uneasy looks."
"“哎呀，先生们，”主席说，“我重复一遍我昨天说过的话。请放心，几百万是不成问题的。”","“Well, gentlemen,” replied the president, “I repeat what I said yesterday.Make yourselves easy; the millions will not be wanting.”"
"主席向所有人作了担保，并定好第三次会议将在下一晚召开，此次会议就结束了。","With this assurance of their president the committee separated, after having fixed their third meeting for the following evening."
"第九章 火药的问题","CHAPTER IX THE QUESTION OF THE POWDERS"
"只剩下火药的问题需要考虑了。大家都饶有兴趣地等待着最后的决定。炮弹的大小和炮筒的长度已经确定了，那么需要多少火药才可以产生足够的冲力呢？","There remained for consideration merely the question of powders.The public awaited with interest its final decision.The size of the projectile, the length of the cannon being settled, what would be the quantity of powder necessary to produce impulsion?"
"普遍的说法认为，火药是由修道士施瓦茨于十四世纪发明的，为了这一伟大发明，他付出了生命的代价。但是，已有充分证据证明，这个故事应该只是中世纪的传说。火药并不是由某一个人发明的，它是希腊火药的直系衍生物，二者同样都是由硫磺和硝石组成的。几乎很少有人了解火药的机械动力。而现在，要想理解委员会所面临的问题有多重要，就必须先懂得火药的机械动力是怎么一回事。","It is generally asserted that gunpowder was invented in the fourteenth century by the monk Schwartz, who paid for his grand discovery with his life.It is, however, pretty well proved that this story ought to be ranked among the legends of the middle ages.Gunpowder was not invented by any one; it was the lineal successor of the Greek fire, which, like itself, was composed of sulfur and saltpeter.Few persons are acquainted with the mechanical power of gunpowder.Now this is precisely what is necessary to be understood in order to comprehend the importance of the question submitted to the committee."
"一升火药大约有两磅重，在燃烧的过程中，它会产生400升的气体。温度升高到2,400度时，这些释放出来的气体就会膨胀至4,000升：因此，火药体积与其燃烧时释放出的气体体积的比是1比4,000。所以人们可以想象，当气体被压缩在四千分之一的有限空间里时，会受到多大的挤压力。当然，委员会的成员们第二天晚上见面时，已经对这一切了如指掌了。","A litre of gunpowder weighs about two pounds; during combustion it produces 400 litres of gas.This gas, on being liberated and acted upon by temperature raised to 2,400 degrees, occupies a space of 4,000 litres: consequently the volume of powder is to the volume of gas produced by its combustion as 1 to 4,000.One may judge, therefore, of the tremendous pressure on this gas when compressed within a space 4,000 times too confined.All this was, of course, well known to the members of the committee when they met on the following evening."
"这一次，首先发言的是埃尔芬斯通少校，在战争期间，他就已经是火药厂的主任了。","The first speaker on this occasion was Major Elphinstone, who had been the director of the gunpowder factories during the war."
"“先生们，”这位出色的化学家说道，“首先，我将从一些数据入手，作为我们计算的基础。旧式的24磅炮弹需要用16磅的火药才能发射出去。”","“Gentlemen,” said this distinguished chemist, “I begin with some figures which will serve as the basis of our calculation.The old 24-pounder shot required for its discharge sixteen pounds of powder.”"
"“你确定是这个数量么？”巴比康插话道。","“You are certain of this amount?” broke in Barbicane."
"“相当确定。”少校答道，“阿姆斯特朗大炮只需75磅的火药，就可以把重800磅的炮弹发射出去，而罗德曼的哥伦比亚大炮只需160磅的火药，就可以将半吨重的炮弹射到六英里外。这些数据不可能有问题，因为我在枪炮委员会面前宣誓时，就提到过这一点。”","“Quite certain,” replied the major.“The Armstrong cannon employs only seventy-five pounds of powder for a projectile of eight hundred pounds, and the Rodman Columbiad uses only one hundred and sixty pounds of powder to send its half ton shot a distance of six miles.These facts cannot be called in question, for I myself raised the point during the depositions taken before the committee of artillery.”"
"“没错。”将军说道。","“Quite true,” said the general."
"“好，”少校接着说道，“这些数据表明，火药的量并未随炮弹重量的增加而增加。也就是说，如果一枚24磅的炮弹需要16磅的火药——换句话说，如果普通大炮所需的火药相当于炮弹重量的三分之二，那么这个比例并不是不可更改的。计算一下，你们就会发现我们用不着333磅的火药，只要160磅就足够了。”","“Well,” replied the major, “these figures go to prove that the quantity of powder is not increased with the weight of the shot; that is to say, if a 24-pounder shot requires sixteen pounds of powder;—in other words, if in ordinary guns we employ a quantity of powder equal to two-thirds of the weight of the projectile, this proportion is not constant.Calculate, and you will see that in place of three hundred and thirty-three pounds of powder, the quantity is reduced to no more than one hundred and sixty pounds.”"
"“你想说什么？”主席问道。","“What are you aiming at?” asked the president."
"“我亲爱的少校，如果你把你的理论推到极限，”J.T.马斯顿说，“你就会得到这样的结论：当炮弹变得足够重时，就不需要任何火药了。”","“If you push your theory to extremes, my dear major,” said J. T. Maston, “you will get to this, that as soon as your shot becomes sufficiently heavy you will not require any powder at all.”"
"“我们的朋友马斯顿总是爱开玩笑，甚至在一些严肃的问题上也是。”少校大声说道；“不过请他放心，我一会儿要提出的火药重量绝对可以满足他这位大炮专家的胃口。在战争期间，对于那些超大型的大炮来说，火药的重量仅为炮弹重量的十分之一。我这些话只是就统计数据而言，没有别的意思。","“Our friend Maston is always at his jokes, even in serious matters,” cried the major; “but let him make his mind easy, I am going presently to propose gunpowder enough to satisfy his artillerist’s propensities.I only keep to statistical facts when I say that, during the war, and for the very largest guns, the weight of the powder was reduced, as the result of experience, to a tenth part of the weight of the shot.”"
"“完全正确。”摩根说；“不过，在决定多少火药才能产生足够的冲力之前，我认为应该——”","“Perfectly correct,” said Morgan; “but before deciding the quantity of powder necessary to give the impulse, I think it would be as well——”"
"“我们将不得不使用大颗的火药，”少校继续说道，“它燃烧起来比小颗的火药更快。”","“We shall have to employ a large-grained powder,” continued the major; “its combustion is more rapid than that of the small.”"
"“那是毫无疑问的，”摩根回答说，“但是大颗火药极具破坏性，而且大炮的弹膛也得相应加大。”","“No doubt about that,” replied Morgan; “but it is very destructive, and ends by enlarging the bore of the pieces.”"
"“的确，大颗火药是会破坏那些长年使用的大炮，可是对于我们的哥伦比亚大炮而言，情况就不同了。我们会使爆炸没有危险，而且，为了充分发挥其力学效应，火药必须在瞬间被点燃。”","“Granted; but that which is injurious to a gun destined to perform long service is not so to our Columbiad.We shall run no danger of an explosion; and it is necessary that our powder should take fire instantaneously in order that its mechanical effect may be complete.”"
"“我们必须弄许多点火孔，”马斯顿说，“在同一时刻从不同点将其点燃。”","“We must have,” said Maston, “several touch-holes, so as to fire it at different points at the same time.”"
"“当然，”埃尔芬斯通说；“但是那样会使炮弹的发射更加困难。所以，我还是提议使用大颗的火药，这样就不存在那些困难了。罗德曼在哥伦比亚大炮中装满了如板栗一样大小的火药，它们由柳木炭制成，是在铸铁盘中变干的。这种火药坚硬而且闪闪发亮，拿完手上不留痕迹，它的成分中含有较大比例的氢和氧，能在瞬间燃烧，尽管具有很大的破坏性，却不会对炮膛口有太大损伤。”","“Certainly,” replied Elphinstone; “but that will render the working of the piece more difficult.I return then to my large-grained powder, which removes those difficulties.In his Columbiad charges Rodman employed a powder as large as chestnuts, made of willow charcoal, simply dried in cast-iron pans.This powder was hard and glittering, left no trace upon the hand, contained hydrogen and oxygen in large proportion, took fire instantaneously, and, though very destructive, did not sensibly injure the mouth-piece.”"
"一直到这时为止，巴比康都没有参与讨论；他让别人发言，而自己在听，显然，他已经有了主意。现在，他只是简单地问道：“那么，我的朋友们，你们建议用多少火药呢？”","Up to this point Barbicane had kept aloof from the discussion; he left the others to speak while he himself listened; he had evidently got an idea.He now simply said, “Well, my friends, what quantity of powder do you propose?”"
"三位成员互相看了看。","The three members looked at one another."
"“20万磅。”最后摩根说。","“Two hundred thousand pounds.” at last said Morgan."
"“50万磅。”少校补充说。","“Five hundred thousand,” added the major."
"“80万磅。”马斯顿大声叫道。","“Eight hundred thousand,” screamed Maston."
"这三种建议使得现场一度沉寂下来，最后，主席打破了沉默。","A moment of silence followed this triple proposal; it was at last broken by the president."
"“先生们，”他平静地说，“我始终坚持这样一个原则：在给定条件下，大炮产生的反冲力是无限的。我的朋友马斯顿先生一定会感到惊讶，因为我不得不说，他的计算太胆小了。我建议使用双倍的80万磅的火药。”","“Gentlemen,” he quietly said, “I start from this principle, that the resistance of a gun, constructed under the given conditions, is unlimited.I shall surprise our friend Maston, then, by stigmatizing his calculations as timid; and I propose to double his 800,000 pounds of powder.”"
"“160万磅？”马斯顿从椅子上跳起来叫道。","“Sixteen hundred thousand pounds?” shouted Maston, leaping from his seat."
"“正是如此。”","“Just so.”"
"“那么，我们就得采用我设想的炮筒长达半英里的大炮了。因为你知道，160万磅的炸药将会占据大约两万立方英尺的空间，既然大炮的容量不会超过54,000立方英尺，而火药就占了一半，那么为了让气体对炮弹有足够的冲力，炮膛就必须得长些。”","“We shall have to come then to my ideal of a cannon half a mile long; for you see 1,600,000 pounds will occupy a space of about 20,000 cubic feet; and since the contents of your cannon do not exceed 54,000 cubic feet, it would be half full; and the bore will not be more than long enough for the gas to communicate to the projectile sufficient impulse.”"
"“尽管如此，”主席说，“我还是坚持这个数量。要知道，160万磅的火药将会创造出60亿升的气体。60亿！你们明白吗？”","“Nevertheless,” said the president, “I hold to that quantity of powder.Now, 1,600,000 pounds of powder will create 6,000,000,000 litres of gas.Six thousand millions!You quite understand?”"
"“那么，我们该做什么呢？”将军问道。","“What is to be done then?” said the general."
"“事情很简单，我们必须把这数量庞大的火药的体积缩小，同时保持它的机械能量。”","“The thing is very simple; we must reduce this enormous quantity of powder, while preserving to it its mechanical power.”"
"“对，但是通过什么手段呢？”","“Good; but by what means?”"
"“我会告诉你们的。”巴比康平静地说。","“I am going to tell you,” replied Barbicane quietly."
"“没有比把它的体积减小到原来的四分之一更容易的事了。你们知道那种奇特的、构成蔬菜基本组织的多孔物质吗？我们能从多种植物体中找到相当纯净的这种物质，特别是在棉花中——就在棉花籽的绒毛中。这样，棉花与冷硝酸结合就会形成一种绝对不溶、易燃、易爆的物质。它于1832年被法国化学家布拉科诺发现，他称它为克西罗丁。1838年，另一位法国人珀卢兹研究了它的各种性能，终于，到了1846年，巴塞尔的化学教授舍恩拜因建议将它用于战争。现在这种火药被称作‘低氮硝化纤维素’或是‘硝化棉’，生成它的时候，只要先把棉花放入硝酸中，15分钟后用水冲洗，接着把它弄干，就可以使用了。”","“Nothing is more easy than to reduce this mass to one quarter of its bulk.You know that curious cellular matter which constitutes the elementary tissues of vegetable?This substance is found quite pure in many bodies, especially in cotton, which is nothing more than the down of the seeds of the cotton plant.Now cotton, combined with cold nitric acid, become transformed into a substance eminently insoluble, combustible, and explosive.It was first discovered in 1832, by Braconnot, a French chemist, who called it xyloidine.In 1838 another Frenchman, Pelouze, investigated its different properties, and finally, in 1846, Schonbein, professor of chemistry at Bale, proposed its employment for purposes of war. This powder, now called pyroxyle, or fulminating cotton, is prepared with great facility by simply plunging cotton for fifteen minutes in nitric acid, then washing it in water, then drying it, and it is ready for use.”"
"“没有比这更简单的了。”摩根说。","“Nothing could be more simple,” said Morgan."
"“而且，低氮硝化纤维素不会变潮——这对于我们来说是一个很有用的特性，因为把它装到炮膛里面得需要好几天的工夫。它在170度、而非240度的时候就能被点燃，并且燃烧得很快，假如我们用普通的火药去点燃它，那么普通火药还来不及燃烧时，它就已经烧起来了。”","“Moreover, pyroxyle is unaltered by moisture—a valuable property to us, inasmuch as it would take several days to charge the cannon.It ignites at 170 degrees in place of 240, and its combustion is so rapid that one may set light to it on the top of the ordinary powder, without the latter having time to ignite.”"
"“太完美了！”少校大声说道。","“Perfect!” exclaimed the major."
"“只不过它更贵。”","“Only it is more expensive.”"
"“贵算得了什么？”马斯顿叫道。","“What matter?” cried J. T. Maston."
"“最终，它给予炮弹的速度是一般火药的四倍。补充一点，如果我们把它和相当于它重量八分之一的硝酸钾混合，它的膨胀力还会显著增加。”","“Finally, it imparts to projectiles a velocity four times superior to that of gunpowder.I will even add, that if we mix it with one-eighth of its own weight of nitrate of potassium, its expansive force is again considerably augmented.”"
"“有那个必要吗？”少校问道。","“Will that be necessary?” asked the major."
"“我觉得没有。”巴比康回答说，“这样一来，我们只要用40万磅的硝化棉就可以代替160万磅的火药，而且，由于我们可以毫无危险地将500磅的棉花压缩至27立方英尺，全部火药在哥伦比亚炮膛内占据的高度不会超过180英尺。这样的话，炮弹将在60亿升气体的作用力之下在炮膛中穿行700多英尺，之后才会被射向月球。”","“I think not,” replied Barbicane.“So, then, in place of 1,600,000 pounds of powder, we shall have but 400,000 pounds of fulminating cotton; and since we can, without danger, compress 500 pounds of cotton into twenty-seven cubic feet, the whole quantity will not occupy a height of more than 180 feet within the bore of the Columbiad.In this way the shot will have more than 700 feet of bore to traverse under a force of 6,000,000,000 litres of gas before taking its flight toward the moon.”"
"此时此刻，J. T. 马斯顿无法抑制自己的情绪，他就像射出的炮弹一样扑进了巴比康的怀中，要不是巴比康抗撞，早就被他撞穿了。","At this juncture J. T. Maston could not repress his emotion; he flung himself into the arms of his friend with the violence of a projectile, and Barbicane would have been stove in if he had not been boom-proof."
"第三次会议就在这一幕中结束了。","This incident terminated the third meeting of the committee."
"对于巴比康和他的同事们来说，没有什么事情是不可能的，他们已经成功地解决了炮弹、大炮和火药的复杂问题。他们已经起草了计划，只剩下执行了。","Barbicane and his bold colleagues, to whom nothing seemed impossible, had succeeding in solving the complex problems of projectile, cannon, and powder.Their plan was drawn up, and it only remained to put it into execution."
"“只剩下细节的问题了，小事一桩。”J. T. 马斯顿说。","“A mere matter of detail, a bagatelle,” said J. T. Maston."
"第十章 一个敌人和两千五百万朋友","CHAPTER X ONE ENEMY v. TWENTY-FIVE MILLIONS OF FRIENDS"
"对于枪炮俱乐部这项计划的细枝末节，美国民众都十分感兴趣。委员会的讨论持续了一天又一天。为这项伟大实验做的最简单的准备，它所涉及的数据问题，需要解决的机械困难——一句话，整个工作计划——将这一备受关注的实验推向了最高潮。","The American public took a lively interest in the smallest details of the enterprise of the Gun Club.It followed day by day the discussion of the committee.The most simple preparations for the great experiment, the questions of figures which it involved, the mechanical difficulties to be resolved—in one word, the entire plan of work—roused the popular excitement to the highest pitch."
"民众们的关注原本纯粹出于对科学的兴趣，却因为接下来的事情大大加深了：","The purely scientific attraction was suddenly intensified by the following incident:"
"我们已经看到了，巴比康的计划为他自己赢得了众多的崇拜者和朋友。然而，在美国所有的州之中，唯独有一个人反对枪炮俱乐部的计划。他一有机会就攻击这个计划，而巴比康对于那个人的反对，也比对于其他所有人的支持还要敏感，这就是人类的天性。他很清楚这个人反对的动机，这孤立无援的敌意的起因，也深知反对者的人格及旧名声，知道他的反对是出于怎样的自恋心态。","We have seen what legions of admirers and friends Barbicane’s project had rallied round its author.There was, however, one single individual alone in all the States of the Union who protested against the attempt of the Gun Club.He attacked it furiously on every opportunity, and human nature is such that Barbicane felt more keenly the opposition of that one man than he did the applause of all the others.He was well aware of the motive of this antipathy, the origin of this solitary enmity, the cause of its personality and old standing, and in what rivalry of self-love it had its rise."
"枪炮俱乐部的主席从未见过这位意志坚决的敌人。不过这样也算万幸，因为这两个人要是见了面，一定会产生严重的后果。对手和巴比康一样，是一位科学家，脾气火爆、大胆，并且很强势。总之，是个纯粹的美国佬。他名叫尼科尔上校，住在费城。","This persevering enemy the president of the Gun Club had never seen.Fortunate that it was so, for a meeting between the two men would certainly have been attended with serious consequences.This rival was a man of science, like Barbicane himself, of a fiery, daring, and violent disposition; a pure Yankee.His name was Captain Nicholl; he lived at Philadelphia."
"大多数人都知道南北战争期间发生在大炮和装甲铁船之间的那场有趣的对抗。结果是双方的海军全部重建，一边加强了战斗力，另一边增加了兵力。在武装反抗其他地方的炮弹之后，梅里马克、莫尼特、田纳西、威霍肯等地也发射了大量炮弹。己所不欲，却施于人——事实上，这就是整个战争艺术所依据的不朽法则。","Most people are aware of the curious struggle which arose during the Federal war between the guns and armor of iron-plated ships.The result was the entire reconstruction of the navy of both the continents; as the one grew heavier, the other became thicker in proportion.The Merrimac, the Monitor, the Tennessee, the Weehawken discharged enormous projectiles themselves, after having been armor-clad against the projectiles of others.In fact they did to others that which they would not they should do to them—that grand principle of immortality upon which rests the whole art of war."
"如果说巴比康是炮弹的伟大创始人，那么尼科尔就是金属板的伟大锻造者。一个在巴尔的摩日夜发射炮弹，另一个在费城日夜锻造金属。每当巴比康发明一枚新炮弹，尼科尔就立即发明一种新的金属板，接下来每个人都会用一系列观点来反对对方。他们之间相距五六十英里，却从未谋面，这对于两地的居民而言是一件幸事，对国家的安定也有好处。这两位发明者到底谁更胜一筹呢？从所得结果来看，是很难决定的。然而最新记录表明，装甲板最终还是输给了炮弹，不过一些权威人士在这一点上仍存有疑虑。","Now if Barbicane was a great founder of shot, Nicholl was a great forger of plates; the one cast night and day at Baltimore, the other forged day and night at Philadelphia.As soon as ever Barbicane invented a new shot, Nicholl invented a new plate; each followed a current of ideas essentially opposed to the other.Happily for these citizens, so useful to their country, a distance of from fifty to sixty miles separated them from one another, and they had never yet met. Which of these two inventors had the advantage over the other it was difficult to decide from the results obtained.By last accounts, however, it would seem that the armor-plate would in the end have to give way to the shot; nevertheless, there were competent judges who had their doubts on the point."
"在最近的一次实验中，巴比康的圆锥炮弹就像许多枚针，穿进尼科尔的金属板中。那一天，费城的锻造者认为自己一定能胜利，甚至都不屑于向他的对手表现出轻蔑之意，但是后来，当对方换上了仅仅重600磅、速度还不怎么快的炮弹时，上校就不得不认输了。事实上，这些炮弹把他最好的金属板炸成了碎片。","At the last experiment the cylindro-conical projectiles of Barbicane stuck like so many pins in the Nicholl plates.On that day the Philadelphia iron-forger then believed himself victorious, and could not evince contempt enough for his rival; but when the other afterward substituted for conical shot simple 600-pound shells, at very moderate velocity, the captain was obliged to give in.In fact, these projectiles knocked his best metal plate to shivers."
"事情发展到这个阶段，炮弹似乎胜利了。就在那天，对抗结束了，但也就在那天，尼科尔又用熟钢制造出了一种新的装甲板。它是装甲板中的杰作，可以向世界上所有的炮弹示威。上校把它运到了位于华盛顿的试炮场，向主席的枪炮俱乐部发出挑战。巴比康为了和平起见，拒绝进行实验。","Matters were at this stage, and victory seemed to rest with the shot, when the war came to an end on the very day when Nicholl had completed a new armor-plate of wrought steel.It was a masterpiece of its kind, and bid defiance to all the projectiles of the world.The captain had it conveyed to the Polygon at Washington, challenging the president of the Gun Club to break it.Barbicane, peace having been declared, declined to try the experiment."
"尼科尔已是怒气冲冲，他提议无论是实心的、空心的、圆的或者是锥形的，任何炮弹都可以来射他的金属板。主席拒绝了他的提议，他不想让自己最后的胜利打折扣。","Nicholl, now furious, offered to expose his plate to the shock of any shot, solid, hollow, round, or conical.Refused by the president, who did not choose to compromise his last success."
"尼科尔很反感这种固执脾气，他向巴比康提出了各种好处，试图以此来引诱他。他建议把金属板固定在离炮弹200码的范围内。巴比康仍然固执地拒绝了他的提议。100码？就是75码也不行啊！","Nicholl, disgusted by this obstinacy, tried to tempt Barbicane by offering him every chance.He proposed to fix the plate within two hundred yards of the gun.Barbicane still obstinate in refusal.A hundred yards?Not even seventy-five!"
"“那么50码！”上校通过报纸叫嚣道。“25码！而且我会站在它的后面！”","“At fifty then!” roared the captain through the newspapers.“At twenty-five yards! and I’ll stand behind!”"
"巴比康回答说，即使尼科尔上校站在金属板前面，他也不会再发射炮弹了。","Barbicane returned for answer that, even if Captain Nicholl would be so good as to stand in front, he would not fire any more."
"对于这个回答，尼科尔无法控制自己的情绪，他暗示说对方胆怯了，拒绝发射炮弹的人是害怕了，那些战斗在六英里外的炮术家的个人胆量正逐渐被数学公式取代。","Nicholl could not contain himself at this reply; threw out hints of cowardice; that a man who refused to fire a cannon-shot was pretty near being afraid of it; that artillerists who fight at six miles distance are substituting mathematical formulae for individual courage."
"对于这些含沙射影的批评，巴比康不予理会。或许他根本就没有听到，因为他太专注于谋划自己这项伟大的事业了。","To these insinuations Barbicane returned no answer; perhaps he never heard of them, so absorbed was he in the calculations for his great enterprise."
"当巴比康向枪炮俱乐部的会员们作了那篇著名的报告后，上校便一直怒气冲冲的。他那强烈的嫉妒中又夹杂着一种完全无能为力的感觉。他怎样才能发明一样东西，胜过900英尺的哥伦比亚大炮？什么装甲板能抵抗30,000磅重的炮弹？最初，他被很强的攻势所压倒，但是慢慢地，他又恢复了信心，决定用自己那颇有分量的论据来粉碎这一提议。","When his famous communication was made to the Gun Club, the captain’s wrath passed all bounds; with his intense jealousy was mingled a feeling of absolute impotence.How was he to invent anything to beat this 900-feet Columbiad?What armor-plate could ever resist a projectile of 30,000 pounds weight?Overwhelmed at first under this violent shock, he by and by recovered himself, and resolved to crush the proposal by weight of his arguments."
"于是，他对枪炮俱乐部的工作进行了猛烈的攻击，在报纸上发表了多封信函，力图证明巴比康对炮弹制造的基本原理一无所知。他坚持认为，任何炮弹都绝不可能承受每秒12,000码的速度，而且即使能达到这一速度，这个重量的炮弹也不可能超越地球大气层的限制。退一步来说，即使我们能够获得这个速度，而且这个速度已经足够快，那弹壳也承受不了点燃160万磅火药而产生的气体的压力。假设它能抵得住压力，也耐不了那个温度，它一离开哥伦比亚大炮，就会熔化，并如炽热的雨点一般落在那些鲁莽的旁观者头上。","He then violently attacked the labors of the Gun Club, published a number of letters in the newspapers, endeavored to prove Barbicane ignorant of the first principles of gunnery.He maintained that it was absolutely impossible to impress upon any body whatever a velocity of 12,000 yards per second; that even with such a velocity a projectile of such a weight could not transcend the limits of the earth’s atmosphere.Further still, even regarding the velocity to be acquired, and granting it to be sufficient, the shell could not resist the pressure of the gas developed by the ignition of 1,600,000 pounds of powder; and supposing it to resist that pressure, it would be less able to support that temperature; it would melt on quitting the Columbiad, and fall back in a red-hot shower upon the heads of the imprudent spectators."
"巴比康继续他的计划，并没有在意这些攻击。","Barbicane continued his work without regarding these attacks."
"后来，尼科尔又从另外几个方面提出了问题。无论从哪个角度来说，这个计划都是毫无用处的。这一点姑且不提，他认为这个实验的极端危险性令人担忧，既危害到那些在现场观看这一罪孽奇观的公民们，又会给这尊应受谴责的大炮周围的城镇带来危险。他还说到，如果炮弹不能成功到达目的地（绝对不可能成功），它必然要落回地球，加之其返回速度将是原来速度的平方，这个庞然大物的撞击将给地球的每一个角落带来巨大的危险。因此，在这种情况之下，要做到不干预自由公民的权利，就需要政府的介入，不应因某个人的一己欢愉而威胁到全人类的安全。","Nicholl then took up the question in its other aspects.Without touching upon its uselessness in all points of view, he regarded the experiment as fraught with extreme danger, both to the citizens, who might sanction by their presence so reprehensible a spectacle, and also to the towns in the neighborhood of this deplorable cannon.He also observed that if the projectile did not succeed in reaching its destination (a result absolutely impossible), it must inevitably fall back upon the earth, and that the shock of such a mass, multiplied by the square of its velocity, would seriously endanger every point of the globe.Under the circumstances, therefore, and without interfering with the rights of free citizens, it was a case for the intervention of Government, which ought not to endanger the safety of all for the pleasure of one individual."
"然而，尽管提出了这么多论据，却仍然没有人赞同尼克尔上校的观点。没有人听他的话，他也没能让任何一个崇拜者疏远枪炮俱乐部的主席。巴比康甚至都没有费力去反驳对手的论调。","In spite of all his arguments, however, Captain Nicholl remained alone in his opinion.Nobody listened to him, and he did not succeed in alienating a single admirer from the president of the Gun Club.The latter did not even take the pains to refute the arguments of his rival."
"尼科尔被逼到了绝境，他未能通过自己的力量解决这一问题，便决定用钱来解决。因此，他在里士满的《探究者报》上登出来一系列赌注，主要有以下几条，赌注逐条递增：","Nicholl, driven into his last entrenchments, and not able to fight personally in the cause, resolved to fight with money.He published, therefore, in the Richmond Inquirer a series of wagers, conceived in these terms, and on an increasing scale:"
"一、（1,000美元）——枪炮俱乐部筹不够实验所需的资金。","No.1 ($1,000).—That the necessary funds for the experiment of the Gun Club will not be forthcoming."
"二、（2,000美元）——锻造900英尺的大炮是行不通的，不可能成功。","No.2 ($2,000).—That the operation of casting a cannon of 900 feet is impracticable, and cannot possibly succeed."
"三、（3,000美元）哥伦比亚大炮无法装载火药，低氮硝化纤维素在炮弹的压力下会自燃。","No.3 ($3,000).—That is it impossible to load the Columbiad, and that the pyroxyle will take fire spontaneously under the pressure of the projectile."
"四、（4,000美元）哥伦比亚大炮首次点火就会爆炸。","No.4 ($4,000).—That the Columbiad will burst at the first fire."
"五、（5,000美元）炮弹的射程超不过六英里，而且发射后的几秒钟内就会掉下来。","No.5 ($5,000).—That the shot will not travel farther than six miles, and that it will fall back again a few seconds after its discharge."
"因此，固执己见的上校所冒的风险可不是一个小数目。他赌了不下15,000美元。","It was an important sum, therefore, which the captain risked in his invincible obstinacy.He had no less than $15,000 at stake."
"尽管这次的赌很重大，但在五月十九日，他却收到了一个密封的包裹，里面的回复极其简洁：“巴尔的摩，十月十九日。“愿赌服输。“巴比康。”","Notwithstanding the importance of the challenge, on the 19th of May he received a sealed packet containing the following superbly laconic reply: “BALTIMORE, October 19.“Done. “BARBICANE.”"
"第十一章 佛罗里达和德克萨斯","CHAPTER XI FLORIDA AND TEXAS"
"还有一个问题有待解决，那就是必须为实验选择一个有利的地点。根据剑桥天文台的指示，射击的方向必须和地平线垂直，也就是说，要朝向天顶射击。可是，只有在南北纬0度和28度之间的地方，才能看到月球穿越天顶。因此，需要精准地确定应在地球上的哪一地点铸造巨型哥伦比亚大炮。","One question remained yet to be decided; it was necessary to choose a favorable spot for the experiment.According to the advice of the Observatory of Cambridge, the gun must be fired perpendicularly to the plane of the horizon, that is to say, toward the zenith.Now the moon does not traverse the zenith, except in places situated between 0@ and 28@ of latitude.It became, then, necessary to determine exactly that spot on the globe where the immense Columbiad should be cast."
"十月二十日，枪炮俱乐部召开全体会议，巴比康带来了一幅壮观的美国地图。“先生们”，他在讨论开始前说道，“我想我们都同意这个观点，那就是这个实验不能也不应该在任何联邦领土以外的地点实施。幸运的是，美国的国境线有些地方已经向南延伸到北纬28度了。如果你看一眼这幅地图，就会发现整个德克萨斯南部和佛罗里达南部都在我们掌控之中。”","On the 20th of October, at a general meeting of the Gun Club, Barbicane produced a magnificent map of the United States.“Gentlemen,” said he, in opening the discussion, “I presume that we are all agreed that this experiment cannot and ought not to be tried anywhere but within the limits of the soil of the Union.Now, by good fortune, certain frontiers of the United States extend downward as far as the 28th parallel of the north latitude.If you will cast your eye over this map, you will see that we have at our disposal the whole of the southern portion of Texas and Florida.”"
"于是最后达成一致，哥伦比亚大炮一定要铸造在德克萨斯或佛罗里达的领土上。然而，这个决定却在两个州的各个城镇之间引发了一场史无前例的竞争。","It was finally agreed, then, that the Columbiad must be cast on the soil of either Texas or Florida.The result, however, of this decision was to create a rivalry entirely without precedent between the different towns of these two States."
"北纬28度线在接近美国海岸的地方横穿佛罗里达半岛，把它分成大小几乎相等的两部分。接着又延伸入墨西哥湾，穿过阿拉巴马、密西西比和路易斯安那三州的海岸线所形成的弧状地带，随后擦边经过德克萨斯，从德克萨斯州切出一个三角形地区，接着继续延伸到墨西哥,穿过索诺拉省，跨过老加利福尼亚，最后消失在太平洋。因此，德克萨斯和佛罗里达两州中，只有坐落在这条纬线以南的那些地区才符合规定的纬度条件。","The 28th parallel, on reaching the American coast, traverses the peninsula of Florida, dividing it into two nearly equal portions.Then, plunging into the Gulf of Mexico, it subtends the arc formed by the coast of Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana; then skirting Texas, off which it cuts an angle, it continues its course over Mexico, crosses the Sonora, Old California, and loses itself in the Pacific Ocean.It was, therefore, only those portions of Texas and Florida which were situated below this parallel which came within the prescribed conditions of latitude."
"佛罗里达州南部没有重要的城市，仅仅密布着防御印第安游牧部落的堡垒。只有一个城镇——坦帕城，可以说位置比较有利。","Florida, in its southern part, reckons no cities of importance; it is simply studded with forts raised against the roving Indians.One solitary town, Tampa Town, was able to put in a claim in favor of its situation."
"相反，德克萨斯州的城镇多得多，也重要得多。努埃西斯县的科珀斯克里斯蒂，以及所有坐落在布拉沃河附近的城市，如威伯县内的拉雷多、科马里特、圣伊格纳西奥，斯塔尔县内的里奥格兰德城，伊达尔戈县内的爱丁堡，卡梅伦县内的圣丽塔、埃尔潘达、布朗斯维尔，这些城市组成了一个强势的联盟，与自命不凡的佛罗里达针锋相对。因此，一得知这个决定，德克萨斯和佛罗里达的代表们就以迅雷不及掩耳的速度赶到巴尔的摩来了。从那一时刻起，巴比康主席和枪炮俱乐部一些有影响力的会员就被代表们的强硬要求弄得应接不暇。如果希腊的七个城市为了争夺荷马诞生地这一荣誉而争论不止，那么，恐怕这两个州的全体人民将为了一尊大炮而诉诸武力。","In Texas, on the contrary, the towns are much more numerous and important.Corpus Christi, in the county of Nueces, and all the cities situated on the Rio Bravo, Laredo, Comalites, San Ignacio on the Web, Rio Grande City on the Starr, Edinburgh in the Hidalgo, Santa Rita, Elpanda, Brownsville in the Cameron, formed an imposing league against the pretensions of Florida.So, scarcely was the decision known, when the Texan and Floridan deputies arrived at Baltimore in an incredibly short space of time.From that very moment President Barbicane and the influential members of the Gun Club were besieged day and night by formidable claims.If seven cities of Greece contended for the honor of having given birth to a Homer, here were two entire States threatening to come to blows about the question of a cannon."
"对抗双方的人们手里带着武器在大街上闲逛；每次他们碰到一起，就会发生冲突，造成灾难性的后果。多亏巴比康主席的谨慎和老练，才化解了这个危机。这些个人的情绪通过各州的报纸表露了出来。《纽约先驱报》和《论坛报》支持德克萨斯；《时代周刊》和《美国评论》则拥护佛罗里达代表们的大计。枪炮俱乐部的会员们不知该听哪一方好了。","The rival parties promenaded the streets with arms in their hands; and at every occasion of their meeting a collision was to be apprehended which might have been attended with disastrous results.Happily the prudence and address of President Barbicane averted the danger.These personal demonstrations found a division in the newspapers of the different States.The New York Herald and the Tribune supported Texas, while the Times and the American Review espoused the cause of the Floridan deputies.The members of the Gun Club could not decide to which to give the preference."
"德克萨斯列出了26个县的阵势；佛罗里达则回应说，鉴于自己的领土大小只有德克萨斯的六分之一，它的12个县一点也不比对方的26个县逊色。","Texas produced its array of twenty-six counties; Florida replied that twelve counties were better than twenty-six in a country only one-sixth part of the size."
"德克萨斯沾沾自喜地炫耀自己有33万人口；不过佛罗里达虽说只有5.6万人口，可是它的领地比德克萨斯小得多，人口密度也就大得多。","Texas plumed itself upon its 330,000 natives; Florida, with a far smaller territory, boasted of being much more densely populated with 56,000."
"德克萨斯人通过《纽约先驱报》的专栏声称，对于一个出产全国最好的棉花、供海军用的最好的绿橡树的州，对一个蕴藏着最棒的铁矿——其中百分之五十的矿产出的是纯金属——而且还出产最好的石油的州，我们总该表示应有的敬意吧。","The Texans, through the columns of the Herald claimed that some regard should be had to a State which grew the best cotton in all America, produced the best green oak for the service of the navy, and contained the finest oil, besides iron mines, in which the yield was fifty per cent of pure metal."
"对于这些话，《美国评论》反驳说，佛罗里达的土地虽然不那么肥沃多产，但却能为哥伦比亚大炮的模制和铸造提供良好的条件，因为佛罗里达到处是沙地和黏土。","To this the American Review replied that the soil of Florida, although not equally rich, afforded the best conditions for the moulding and casting of the Columbiad, consisting as it did of sand and argillaceous earth."
"“那倒是不错，”德克萨斯人说，“但前提是你能到得了这片农村。”现在去往佛罗里达，交通很不方便，而德克萨斯海岸却有着周长14里格的加尔维斯顿湾，可以容纳全世界的海军。","“That may be all very well,” replied the Texans; “but you must first get to this country.Now the communications with Florida are difficult, while the coast of Texas offers the bay of Galveston, which possesses a circumference of fourteen leagues, and is capable of containing the navies of the entire world!”"
"“的确不错，”代表佛罗里达利益的几家报纸这样回答道，“加尔维斯顿湾是位于北纬29度以南！可是我们不也有圣埃斯皮里图湾吗？它恰巧位于28度线上，而且船只可以从这里直接到达坦帕城。”","“A pretty notion truly,” replied the papers in the interest of Florida, “that of Galveston bay below the 29th parallel!Have we not got the bay of Espiritu Santo, opening precisely upon the 28th degree, and by which ships can reach Tampa Town by direct route?”"
"“港湾是不错，可惜一半都被沙子淤塞了！”","“A fine bay; half choked with sand!”"
"“你们的才淤塞了呢！”另一方反驳道。","“Choked yourselves!” returned the others."
"论战就这样持续了好几天，这时，佛罗里达开始努力把对手诱导到新的战场上。一天早上，《时代周刊》拐弯抹角地说，鉴于这是一个纯正的美国事业，它只能在真正的美国领土上进行。","Thus the war went on for several days, when Florida endeavored to draw her adversary away on to fresh ground; and one morning the Times hinted that, the enterprise being essentially American, it ought not to be attempted upon other than purely American territory."
"听了这些话，德克萨斯反驳道：“美国领土！难道我们不和你们一样是美国的领土吗？难道德克萨斯和佛罗里达这两个州不是在1845年同时加入合众国的吗？”","To these words Texas retorted, “American! are we not as much so as you?Were not Texas and Florida both incorporated into the Union in 1845?”"
"“毫无疑问，”《时代周刊》回答，“不过我们从1820年起就属于美国了。”","“Undoubtedly,” replied the Times; “but we have belonged to the Americans ever since 1820.”"
"“不错！”《论坛报》针锋相对地说，“你们是在做了200年的西班牙和英国殖民地后，被人家以500万美元的价格卖给美国的！”","“Yes!” returned the Tribune; “after having been Spaniards or English for two hundred years, you were sold to the United States for five million dollars!”"
"“那又怎样！我们为什么要为此感到羞愧？”","“Well! and why need we blush for that?"
"路易斯安那州不也是在1803年以1600万美元的价格从拿破仑手里买来的吗？“","Was not Louisiana bought from Napoleon in 1803 at the price of sixteen million dollars?”"
"“可恶！”德克萨斯的代表们咆哮道，“像佛罗里达这样的一小窄条地方，竞敢与德克萨斯相提并论！德克萨斯并没有出卖自己，而是赢得了自己的独立。1846年3月2日，墨西哥人被赶走了；塞缪尔·休斯敦在圣哈辛托沿岸打败圣安娜队伍后，宣布成立联邦共和国！总而言之，这个州是自愿加入美利坚合众国的！”","“Scandalous!” roared the Texas deputies.“A wretched little strip of country like Florida to dare to compare itself to Texas, who, in place of selling herself, asserted her own independence, drove out the Mexicans in March 2, 1846, and declared herself a federal republic after the victory gained by Samuel Houston, on the banks of the San Jacinto, over the troops of Santa Anna!—a country, in fine, which voluntarily annexed itself to the United States of America!”"
"“没错，不过那是因为它害怕墨西哥人！”佛罗里达的代表们回应道。","“Yes; because it was afraid of the Mexicans!” replied Florida."
"“害怕！”从这一刻开始，局面变得令人无法忍受。巴尔的摩的大街上，一场血腥的搏斗随时可能在双方之间展开。因此，看管好代表们是十分必要的。","“Afraid!” From this moment the state of things became intolerable.A sanguinary encounter seemed daily imminent between the two parties in the streets of Baltimore.It became necessary to keep an eye upon the deputies."
"巴比康主席不知该向着哪一方好了。充满威胁的短笺、文书、信件像雨点似的投到了他的家里。应该站在哪一边呢？论土质适当、论通讯良好、论交通便利，两个州的条件在这几方面都是势均力敌。从政治上说，也谈不上哪一个州应该在这个问题上占先。","President Barbicane knew not which way to look.Notes, documents, letters full of menaces showered down upon his house.Which side ought he to take?As regarded the appropriation of the soil, the facility of communication, the rapidity of transport, the claims of both States were evenly balanced.As for political prepossessions, they had nothing to do with the question."
"这个僵局已经持续了一段时间，巴比康最终决定一举打破它。他将自己的会员们召集在一起，向他们提出了一个建议。不久我们就会发现，这是一个极其明智的办法。","This dead block had existed for some little time, when Barbicane resolved to get rid of it all at once.He called a meeting of his colleagues, and laid before them a proposition which, it will be seen, was profoundly sagacious."
"“认真考虑了最近佛罗里达和德克萨斯之间发生的纠葛之后，”他说，“我发现，显而易见，同样的难题还会在被选中的那个州的各个城市之间发生。”竞争会由州到城市，一直发展下去。现在，德克萨斯有十一个城市符合条件，它们将继续争抢这个荣誉，这样又要给我们带来新的麻烦，而佛罗里达却只有一个城市符合条件。所以我赞成选择佛罗里达，选择坦帕城。","“On carefully considering,” he said, “what is going on now between Florida and Texas, it is clear that the same difficulties will recur with all the towns of the favored State.The rivalry will descend from State to city, and so on downward.Now Texas possesses eleven towns within the prescribed conditions, which will further dispute the honor and create us new enemies, while Florida has only one. I go in, therefore, for Florida and Tampa Town.”"
"这个决定一经公布，德克萨斯的议员们都垮了。他们怒气冲天，指名道姓地向枪炮俱乐部的众多会员发出恐吓信。治安官们只有一个办法，于是他们就采用了这个办法。他们准备了一列特殊的火车，不管德克萨斯人愿不愿意，就把他们赶上了车。德克萨斯的代表们以每小时30英里的速度离开了这个城市。","This decision, on being made known, utterly crushed the Texan deputies.Seized with an indescribable fury, they addressed threatening letters to the different members of the Gun Club by name.The magistrates had but one course to take, and they took it.They chartered a special train, forced the Texans into it whether they would or no; and they quitted the city with a speed of thirty miles an hour."
"然而，不论他们离开的速度有多快，还是来得及对他们的敌人做最后一次的挖苦和讽刺。","Quickly, however, as they were despatched, they found time to hurl one last and bitter sarcasm at their adversaries."
"他们暗讽佛罗里达不过是两片海之间的一个狭长半岛，声称它绝对抵不住开炮时的反冲力，一开炮，整个州就飞到天上去了。","Alluding to the extent of Florida, a mere peninsula confined between two seas, they pretended that it could never sustain the shock of the discharge, and that it would “bust up” at the very first shot."
"“很好，让它上天好了！”佛罗里达的代表以古斯巴达的简练风格回答道。","“Very well, let it bust up!” replied the Floridans, with a brevity of the days of ancient Sparta."
"第十二章 从全城到全球","CHAPTER XII URBI ET ORBI"
"天文学、机械学、地形学的困难解决后，最后又出现了财政问题。对于任何个人，甚至任何一个州来说，所需要的几百万款子都是很难筹得的。","The astronomical, mechanical, and topographical difficulties resolved, finally came the question of finance.The sum required was far too great for any individual, or even any single State, to provide the requisite millions."
"尽管这纯粹是美国人的事业，但巴比康主席还是做了决定，要将这一事业发展成世界性的事业，向所有民族请求经济上的援助。他坚持认为，参与地球卫星的事业是所有地球人的权利和义务。捐款活动从巴尔的摩扩展到了世界各地——从全城到全球。","President Barbicane undertook, despite of the matter being a purely American affair, to render it one of universal interest, and to request the financial co-operation of all peoples.It was, he maintained, the right and duty of the whole earth to interfere in the affairs of its satellite.The subscription opened at Baltimore extended properly to the whole world— Urbi et orbi."
"尽管这是赠与而非贷款，但这次捐款还是取得了完全超乎意料的成功。从严格意义上讲，那纯粹就是无利可图的事，没有任何获利的机会。","This subscription was successful beyond all expectation; notwithstanding that it was a question not of lending but of giving the money.It was a purely disinterested operation in the strictest sense of the term, and offered not the slightest chance of profit."
"然而，巴比康所做的报告带来的影响并不仅仅局限于美国境内。它的影响越过了大西洋、太平洋，同时延伸到亚洲、欧洲、非洲和大洋洲。合众国的天文台立即与外国的天文台取得了联系。巴黎、彼得堡、柏林、斯德哥尔摩、汉堡、马耳他、里斯本、贝拿勒斯、马德拉斯等城市的天文台表达了它们良好的祝愿；其余的则谨慎地保持沉默，静待结果。格林威治天文台在大不列颠的22个天文机构的支持下，明确地表了态。它大胆地否认了成功的可能性，宣布支持尼科尔上校的理论。但这只不过是英国人的嫉妒。","The effect, however, of Barbicane’s communication was not confined to the frontiers of the United States; it crossed the Atlantic and Pacific, invading simultaneously Asia and Europe, Africa and Oceanica.The observatories of the Union placed themselves in immediate communication with those of foreign countries.Some, such as those of Paris, Petersburg, Berlin, Stockholm, Hamburg, Malta, Lisbon, Benares, Madras, and others, transmitted their good wishes; the rest maintained a prudent silence, quietly awaiting the result.As for the observatory at Greenwich, seconded as it was by the twenty-two astronomical establishments of Great Britain, it spoke plainly enough.It boldly denied the possibility of success, and pronounced in favor of the theories of Captain Nicholl.But this was nothing more than mere English jealousy."
"在十月八号，巴比康主席发表了一篇激情洋溢的声明。在声明里，他向“世界上所有善良的人”发出呼吁。这份文件被翻译成各种语言，获得了巨大的成功。","On the 8th of October President Barbicane published a manifesto full of enthusiasm, in which he made an appeal to “all persons of good will upon the face of the earth.” This document, translated into all languages, met with immense success."
"美国的主要城市都设立了募捐册，捐款的中央办公室设在位于巴尔的摩街9号的巴尔的摩银行。","Subscription lists were opened in all the principal cities of the Union, with a central office at the Baltimore Bank, 9 Baltimore Street."
"另外，募捐还在两个大陆上许多国家的银行进行，名单如下：","In addition, subscriptions were received at the following banks in the different states of the two continents:"
"维也纳，萨洛蒙·迈尔·罗斯柴尔德银行；彼得堡，施蒂格利茨公司；巴黎，动产信贷银行；斯德哥尔摩，托的和阿弗来特生银行，伦敦，内森·迈尔·罗斯柴尔德父子银行；都灵，阿杜安公司；柏林，门德尔松银行；日内瓦，伦巴第和奥地埃公司；君士坦丁堡，奥斯曼帝国银行；布鲁塞尔，J.兰伯特银行；马德里，丹尼尔·威斯勒斯银行；阿姆斯特丹，荷兰信贷公司；罗马，托尔洛尼亚公司；里斯本，勒赛纳银行；哥本哈根，私营银行；里约热内卢，私营银行；蒙得维的亚，私营银行；瓦尔帕莱索和利马，托马斯·拉尚贝尔公司；墨西哥城，马丁·达朗公司。","At Vienna, with S. M. de Rothschild.At Petersburg, Stieglitz and Co.At Paris, The Credit Mobilier.At Stockholm, Tottie and Arfuredson.At London, N. M. Rothschild and Son.At Turin, Ardouin and Co.At Berlin, Mendelssohn.At Geneva, Lombard, Odier and Co.At Constantinople, The Ottoman Bank.At Brussels, J. Lambert. At Madrid, Daniel Weisweller.At Amsterdam, Netherlands Credit Co.At Rome, Torlonia and Co.At Lisbon, Lecesne.At Copenhagen, Private Bank.At Rio de Janeiro, Private Bank.At Montevideo, Private Bank.At Valparaiso and Lima, Thomas la Chambre and Co.At Mexico, Martin Daran and Co."
"巴比康发表声明后的第三天，400万美元的捐款便流入了合众国各个城市的银行。有了这笔资金，枪炮俱乐部可以马上开展工作了。但是，几天后接到了报告，大意是说国外的捐款正在轰轰烈烈地进行着。一些国家很慷慨；其他国家则不那么情愿解开钱袋——这都是国民性格的问题。数字比语言更有说服力，以下便是捐款截止时官方财政报表显示的枪炮俱乐部账户的捐款。","Three days after the manifesto of President Barbicane $4,000,000 were paid into the different towns of the Union.With such a balance the Gun Club might begin operations at once.But some days later advices were received to the effect that foreign subscriptions were being eagerly taken up. Certain countries distinguished themselves by their liberality; others untied their purse-strings with less facility—a matter of temperament.Figures are, however, more eloquent than words, and here is the official statement of the sums which were paid in to the credit of the Gun Club at the close of the subscription."
"俄国交来一份368，733卢布的巨款。俄国人爱好科学，他们热情地研究天文学，并且他们有很多天文台。知道这一点的人就不会对这笔巨款感到惊讶了。","Russia paid in as her contingent the enormous sum of 368,733 roubles.No one need be surprised at this, who bears in mind the scientific taste of the Russians, and the impetus which they have given to astronomical studies—thanks to their numerous observatories."
"法国人起初嘲笑美国人的自命不凡。他们拿月球当借口，发明了足有一千条俏皮话，编出了20来支民谣，这真是庸俗和无知各逞其能啊。不过，正如从前法国人听唱歌前要付钱，现在他们笑完了，就捐了一笔款，合计1,253,930法郎。付出了这样的代价，他们自然有权利给自己找点乐趣。","France began by deriding the pretensions of the Americans.The moon served as a pretext for a thousand stale puns and a score of ballads, in which bad taste contested the palm with ignorance.But as formerly the French paid before singing, so now they paid after having had their laugh, and they subscribed for a sum of 1,253,930 francs.At that price they had a right to enjoy themselves a little."
"虽然奥地利遭遇了财政危机，但它的表现还是相当慷慨的。奥地利的民众一共捐了216,000弗罗林——算是很大的恩赐了。","Austria showed herself generous in the midst of her financial crisis.Her public contributions amounted to the sum of 216,000 florins—a perfect godsend."
"瑞典和挪威的汇款一共是52,000里克斯。对于这两个国家来说，这是笔不小的数目，但要是在克里斯蒂安娜和斯德哥尔摩同时设立捐款站的话，捐款数无疑还会大幅增加。出于某种原因，挪威人不喜欢把钱汇到瑞典去。","Fifty-two thousand rix-dollars were the remittance of Sweden and Norway; the amount is large for the country, but it would undoubtedly have been considerably increased had the subscription been opened in Christiana simultaneously with that at Stockholm.For some reason or other the Norwegians do not like to send their money to Sweden."
"普鲁士汇来了250,000泰勒，证明了它对这项事业的高度认可。","Prussia, by a remittance of 250,000 thalers, testified her high approval of the enterprise."
"土耳其表现得很慷慨，不过那是因为它对这个实验有自己的打算。事实上，月亮的运行规律规定着她的计年方法和斋月的斋戒活动。它捐了1,372,640皮阿斯特，再少就说不过去了。不过，它捐款所表现出的热心多少也能说明来自政府的压力。","Turkey behaved generously; but she had a personal interest in the matter.The moon, in fact, regulates the cycle of her years and her fast of Ramadan.She could not do less than give 1,372,640 piastres; and she gave them with an eagerness which denoted, however, some pressure on the part of the government."
"比利时捐了513,000法郎，平均每个居民二生丁，这使比利时成为二等国中间的佼佼者。","Belgium distinguished herself among the second-rate states by a grant of 513,000 francs—about two centimes per head of her population."
"荷兰和它的殖民地对这个实验很感兴趣，以至于她们捐出了110,000弗罗林，只不过因为付的是现金，所以要了百分之五的回扣。","Holland and her colonies interested themselves to the extent of 110,000 florins, only demanding an allowance of five per cent discount for paying ready money."
"丹麦本国领土狭小，不过也出了9,000达克特，这足以证明它对科学实验的热爱。","Denmark, a little contracted in territory, gave nevertheless 9,000 ducats, proving her love for scientific experiments."
"日耳曼联邦答应出34,285弗罗林。再想多要是不可能的，再说，他们也不会多给一个子儿。","The Germanic Confederation pledged itself to 34,285 florins.It was impossible to ask for more; besides, they would not have given it."
"尽管意大利经济拮据，它还是在人民的口袋里搜罗了200,000里拉。如果威尼西亚还存在的话，也许它能多给点，但是这个地方已经不复存在了。","Though very much crippled, Italy found 200,000 lire in the pockets of her people.If she had had Venetia she would have done better; but she had not."
"教皇国认为他们至少也得捐7,040罗马克朗，而葡萄牙为了表现其对科学的忠诚，拿出了多达30,000克鲁扎多。这实在是笔小钱——只相当于86皮阿斯特，不过独立的国家总是缺钱的。","The States of the Church thought that they could not send less than 7,040 Roman crowns; and Portugal carried her devotion to science as far as 30,000 cruzados.It was the widow’s mite—eighty-six piastres; but self-constituted empires are always rather short of money."
"257法郎，这是瑞士对美国这桩事业最保守的捐献。人们必须承认，它没有看到这次实践的实际意义。对它来说，向月球发射一颗炮弹似乎不可能跟它有什么关系，而且它认为在这样一项毫无把握的事业上投资是不明智的。毕竟，它也许是正确的。","Two hundred and fifty-seven francs, this was the modest contribution of Switzerland to the American work.One must freely admit that she did not see the practical side of the matter.It did not seem to her that the mere despatch of a shot to the moon could possibly establish any relation of affairs with her; and it did not seem prudent to her to embark her capital in so hazardous an enterprise.After all, perhaps she was right."
"至于西班牙呢，它只凑到了110雷拉尔。它的借口是它还要修铁路。事实上，这个国家并不是很重视科学，在科技方面，它仍然处于落后状态。此外，一些西班牙人根本没受过教育，对于炮弹和月球的体积之比没有什么正确认识。他们担心这次实验会破坏事物的正常规律。既然这样，还是离这事远点好。他们能做的也就是拿出几个雷拉尔。","As to Spain, she could not scrape together more than 110 reals.She gave as an excuse that she had her railways to finish.The truth is, that science is not favorably regarded in that country, it is still in a backward state; and moreover, certain Spaniards, not by any means the least educated, did not form a correct estimate of the bulk of the projectile compared with that of the moon.They feared that it would disturb the established order of things.In that case it were better to keep aloof; which they did to the tune of some reals."
"剩下的就是英国了。我们知道，当它收到巴比康的提议时，它是非常轻蔑、非常反感的。大不列颠帝国的2,600万居民是一条心的。他们暗示枪炮俱乐部的实验违背了“不干涉原则”。所以，他们一个钱都没有捐。","There remained but England; and we know the contemptuous antipathy with which she received Barbicane’s proposition.The English have but one soul for the whole twenty-six millions of inhabitants which Great Britain contains.They hinted that the enterprise of the Gun Club was contrary to the “principle of non-intervention.” And they did not subscribe a single farthing."
"对于英国的暗讽，枪炮俱乐部只是耸了耸肩，然后继续进行它的伟大的工作。当南美洲，即秘鲁、智利、巴西、拉普拉塔各省和哥伦比亚把筹集到的300,000美元交到美国人手里时，枪炮俱乐部已经拥有了一笔相当可观的资金，记录如下：","At this intimation the Gun Club merely shrugged its shoulders and returned to its great work.When South America, that is to say, Peru, Chili, Brazil, the provinces of La Plata and Columbia, had poured forth their quota into their hands, the sum of $300,000, it found itself in possession of a considerable capital, of which the following is a statement:"
"美国捐款......400万美元外国捐款......1,446,675美元——总计......5,446,675美元","United States subscriptions, ..$4,000,000 Foreign subscriptions ...$1,446,675—Total, .... $5,446,675"
"这就是民众捐到枪炮俱乐部金库中的钱。","Such was the sum which the public poured into the treasury of the Gun Club."
"对于这样巨大的一笔款子，谁也不觉得奇怪。铸炮、钻炮筒、建炮台、运输工人、在几乎没有人烟的地方施工、建熔炉和车间、机械设备、火药、炮弹以及初期费用，所有这一切，估计差不多能把这笔款子全部花光。南北战争时期，有的炮弹一发就值1,000美元。巴比康主席的这颗射击史上独一无二的炮弹有可能还要贵上五千倍。","Let no one be surprised at the vastness of the amount.The work of casting, boring, masonry, the transport of workmen, their establishment in an almost uninhabited country, the construction of furnaces and workshops, the plant, the powder, the projectile, and incipient expenses, would, according to the estimates, absorb nearly the whole.Certain cannon-shots in the Federal war cost one thousand dollars apiece.This one of President Barbicane, unique in the annals of gunnery, might well cost five thousand times more."
"十月二十日，枪炮俱乐部与科尔德斯普林的工厂签订了一份合同。这家工厂就在纽约附近，战争期间曾装配过最大的巴罗特铸铁炮。双方在合同中规定，科尔德斯普林工厂应该把铸造哥伦比亚大炮所需的物资运到佛罗里达南部的坦帕城。全部工作最迟要在次年十月十五日前完成，届时，该工厂要交出质量合格的大炮，否则，到月球再一次处在同样条件下的那天为止，也就是说在18年零11天期间，每天该工厂需交罚金100美元。","On the 20th of October a contract was entered into with the manufactory at Coldspring, near New York, which during the war had furnished the largest Parrott, cast-iron guns.It was stipulated between the contracting parties that the manufactory of Coldspring should engage to transport to Tampa Town, in southern Florida, the necessary materials for casting the Columbiad.The work was bound to be completed at latest by the 15th of October following, and the cannon delivered in good condition under penalty of a forfeit of one hundred dollars a day to the moment when the moon should again present herself under the same conditions—that is to say, in eighteen years and eleven days."
"招募工人、给工人发工资，以及该项工作的所有必要细节，都由科尔德斯普林工厂负责。","The engagement of the workmen, their pay, and all the necessary details of the work, devolved upon the Coldspring Company."
"这项合同一式两份，枪炮俱乐部主席巴比康和科尔德斯普林工厂经理Ｔ.默奇森分别作为双方的委托人签字。","This contract, executed in duplicate, was signed by Barbicane, president of the Gun Club, of the one part, and T. Murchison director of the Coldspring manufactory, of the other, who thus executed the deed on behalf of their respective principals."

"当枪炮俱乐部违背德克萨斯人的意愿，选定了实验地点以后，在人人读书识字的美国，每个人都开始研究佛罗里达的地理了。书店里从来没销售过这么多这种类型的的书，如《伯特伦的佛罗里达游记》、《罗曼的佛罗里达东部和西部自然史》、《威廉的佛罗里达版图》，《克莱兰论佛罗里达东部的甘蔗栽培》。这些书不得不再出新版。","When the decision was arrived at by the Gun Club, to the disparagement of Texas, every one in America, where reading is a universal acquirement, set to work to study the geography of Florida.Never before had there been such a sale for works like “Bertram’s Travels in Florida,” “Roman’s Natural History of East and West Florida,” “William’s Territory of Florida,” and “Cleland on the Cultivation of the Sugar-Cane in Florida.” It became necessary to issue fresh editions of these works."
"巴比康有比阅读更重要的工作要做。他希望亲自去考察，选定炮台的准确位置。因此，他连一分钟都没有浪费，把制造望远镜的资金拨给剑桥天文台，又与奥尔巴尼的布里杜威尔公司进行了磋商，委托他们按要求的尺寸制造一枚铝制炮弹。然后，在J. T. 马斯顿、埃尔芬斯通和科尔德斯普林工厂经理的陪同下，他离开了巴尔的摩。","Barbicane had something better to do than to read.He desired to see things with his own eyes, and to mark the exact position of the proposed gun.So, without a moment’s loss of time, he placed at the disposal of the Cambridge Observatory the funds necessary for the construction of a telescope, and entered into negotiations with the house of Breadwill and Co., of Albany, for the construction of an aluminum projectile of the required size.He then quitted Baltimore, accompanied by J. T. Maston, Major Elphinstone, and the manager of the Coldspring factory."
"第二天，四个人到达了新奥尔良。在那里，他们立刻踏上坦皮科号——联邦海军的一艘联络船，这条船是政府拨给他们自由支配的。一开船，路易斯安那的海岸就很快消失在视野中了。","On the following day, the four fellow-travelers arrived at New Orleans.There they immediately embarked on board the Tampico, a despatch-boat belonging to the Federal navy, which the government had placed at their disposal; and, getting up steam, the banks of Louisiana speedily disappeared from sight."
"路途不是很远。起航两天后，坦皮科号就行驶了480里的路程，已经能望见佛罗里达的海岸了。离海岸再近些，巴比康发现眼前是一片平坦的低地，看上去有些贫瘠。坦皮科号驶过几条盛产龙虾和牡蛎的小河后，就进入了圣埃斯皮里图湾。最后，船于十月二十日晚上七点，停在了希尔斯巴勒河入海口处一个天然的小港湾内。","The passage was not long.Two days after starting, the Tampico, having made four hundred and eighty miles, came in sight of the coast of Florida.On a nearer approach Barbicane found himself in view of a low, flat country of somewhat barren aspect.After coasting along a series of creeks abounding in lobsters and oysters, the Tampico entered the bay of Espiritu Santo, where she finally anchored in a small natural harbor, formed by the embouchure of the River Hillisborough, at seven P.M., on the 22d of October."
"四位乘客马上下了船。“先生们，”巴比康说，“我们没有时间再浪费了。我们明天必须弄几匹马，去四周勘察勘察。”","Our four passengers disembarked at once.“Gentlemen,” said Barbicane, “we have no time to lose; tomorrow we must obtain horses, and proceed to reconnoiter the country.”"
"巴比康刚踏上坦帕城的土地，就来了三千名居民迎接他，以表示对俱乐部主席的敬意，因为是他的选择使他们的家乡名声大振。","Barbicane had scarcely set his foot on shore when three thousand of the inhabitants of Tampa Town came forth to meet him, an honor due to the president who had signalized their country by his choice."
"然而，巴比康却谢绝了民众的各类欢迎活动，躲在富兰克林旅馆的房间里。","Declining, however, every kind of ovation, Barbicane ensconced himself in a room of the Franklin Hotel."
"第二天，在巴比康的窗户底下，出现了一批精神饱满、活力四射、喷着鼻息的西班牙小马。不过马儿可不止四匹，而是整整五十匹，马上还有骑手。巴比康在三个同伴陪同下走出旅馆，当他们发现自己被这样一支马队包围时，感到十分惊诧。他注意到每个骑手都背着一支卡宾枪，枪套里还插着手枪。","On the morrow some of the small horses of the Spanish breed, full of vigor and of fire, stood snorting under his windows; but instead of four steeds, here were fifty, together with their riders.Barbicane descended with his three fellow- travelers; and much astonished were they all to find themselves in the midst of such a cavalcade.He remarked that every horseman carried a carbine slung across his shoulders and pistols in his holsters."
"巴比康刚刚对这番准备表示惊讶，一个年轻的佛罗里达人便立刻向他作出了解释。那个人静静地说：","On expressing his surprise at these preparations, he was speedily enlightened by a young Floridan, who quietly said:"
"“先生，这里有塞米诺人。”","“Sir, there are Seminoles there.”"
"“什么塞米诺人？”","“What do you mean by Seminoles?”"
"“在草原上到处游荡的野人。因此，我们认为最好一路护送你。”","“Savages who scour the prairies.We thought it best, therefore, to escort you on your road.”"
"“呸！”马斯顿跨上他的坐骑，啐了一声。","“Pooh!” cried J. T. Maston, mounting his steed."
"“好吧，”佛罗里达人说，“不过事情确实是这样的。”","“All right,” said the Floridan; “but it is true enough, nevertheless.”"
"“先生们，”巴比康回答说，“我感谢你们的好意，不过现在我们该上路了。”","“Gentlemen,” answered Barbicane, “I thank you for your kind attention; but it is time to be off.”"
"时间是清晨五点。巴比康和他的队伍离开坦帕城，沿着海岸向阿里菲亚河的方向走去。这条小河在坦帕城以北12英里的地方流入希尔斯巴勒湾。巴比康和他的卫队沿着小河右岸向东前行。小湾的波浪很快就消失在了一片蜿蜒的高地后面，现在举目四望，都是佛罗里达的田野了。","It was five A.M.when Barbicane and his party, quitting Tampa Town, made their way along the coast in the direction of Alifia Creek.This little river falls into Hillisborough Bay twelve miles above Tampa Town.Barbicane and his escort coasted along its right bank to the eastward.Soon the waves of the bay disappeared behind a bend of rising ground, and the Floridan “champagne” alone offered itself to view."
"佛罗里达是胡安·庞塞·德莱昂在1512年圣枝主日发现的，最初叫复活节佛罗里达。干燥、炎热的海岸似乎与这个名称不怎么相称。但是走过几英里的大片土地之后，土质逐渐改变，便会发现这个称号对它来说是当之无愧的。很快出现了平原耕地，那里有北方和热带的各种植物，尽头则是一片片的菠萝、山芋、烟草、水稻、棉花和甘蔗地，一望无际，毫不吝惜地炫耀着自己的富饶。","Florida, discovered on Palm Sunday, in 1512, by Juan Ponce de Leon, was originally named Pascha Florida.It little deserved that designation, with its dry and parched coasts.But after some few miles of tract the nature of the soil gradually changes and the country shows itself worthy of the name.Cultivated plains soon appear, where are united all the productions of the northern and tropical floras, terminating in prairies abounding with pineapples and yams, tobacco, rice, cotton-plants, and sugar-canes, which extend beyond reach of sight, flinging their riches broadcast with careless prodigality."
"巴比康观察到地势越来越高，感到非常满意。J. T. 马斯顿向他询问时，他回答道：","Barbicane appeared highly pleased on observing the progressive elevation of the land; and in answer to a question of J. T. Maston, replied:"
"“我高贵的朋友，在这片高地上铸我们的哥伦比亚大炮真是再好不过了。”","“My worthy friend, we cannot do better than sink our Columbiad in these high grounds.”"
"“为了离月球更近吗？”枪炮俱乐部的秘书问。","“To get nearer the moon, perhaps?” said the secretary of the Gun Club."
"“不完全正确，”巴比康笑着回答，“你不觉得在这片高原上，我们的工作会更容易吗？遇不到地下泉，可以为我们节省不少管道费用；我们可以在日光下工作，而不用下到又深又窄的井里去。接下来我们要做的，就是找一个海拔数百英尺的地方动工开挖。”","“Not exactly,” replied Barbicane, smiling; “do you not see that among these elevated plateaus we shall have a much easier work of it?No struggles with the water-springs, which will save us long expensive tubings; and we shall be working in daylight instead of down a deep and narrow well.Our business, then, is to open our trenches upon ground some hundreds of yards above the level of the sea.”"
"“你说的对，巴比康先生，”默奇森工程师说，“假如我没有弄错的话，我们很快就会找到一个合适的地方。”","“You are right, sir,” struck in Murchison, the engineer; “and, if I mistake not, we shall ere long find a suitable spot for our purpose.”"
"“我真希望现在就开始挖第一下。”主席说。","“I wish we were at the first stroke of the pickaxe,” said the president."
"“我倒希望我们已经挖完最后一下了！”马斯顿大声说。","“And I wish we were at the last,” cried J. T. Maston."
"大约上午十点，这支队伍已经走了12英里。。走过肥沃的田野，接着就是森林地带。这里，各种各样的香气混合在一起，形成一种热带特有的气息。在这几乎无法穿过的丛林里，生长着石榴、橘树、香橼、无花果树、橄榄树、杏树、香蕉树以及巨型藤蔓，它们的花朵争芳斗艳，果实香气四溢。在这些美丽的树木形成的树阴里，有一个属于小鸟的世界，它们长着鲜艳的羽毛，在这里拍动翅膀，柔声歌唱。","About ten A.M. the little band had crossed a dozen miles.To fertile plains succeeded a region of forests.There perfumes of the most varied kinds mingled together in tropical profusion.These almost impenetrable forests were composed of pomegranates, orange-trees, citrons, figs, olives, apricots, bananas, huge vines, whose blossoms and fruits rivaled each other in color and perfume.Beneath the odorous shade of these magnificent trees fluttered and warbled a little world of brilliantly plumaged birds."
"J. T. 马斯顿和少校身处如此壮丽、秀美、富饶的大自然，忍不住盛情赞美。然而，巴比康主席却不怎么被这些奇观打动，他急着往前走，这片土地的肥沃反而让他不快。于是大家急匆匆地向前赶路，还不得已蹚过了几条小河。这么做可不是没有危险的，因为河里有15到18英尺长的巨型短吻鳄出没。马斯顿勇敢地用他的铁钩子恐吓它们，但是只吓到了几只鹈鹕和水鸭，而长腿的火烈鸟则呆呆地望着他们。","J. T. Maston and the major could not repress their admiration on finding themselves in the presence of the glorious beauties of this wealth of nature.President Barbicane, however, less sensitive to these wonders, was in haste to press forward; the very luxuriance of the country was displeasing to him.They hastened onward, therefore, and were compelled to ford several rivers, not without danger, for they were infested with huge alligators from fifteen to eighteen feet long.Maston courageously menaced them with his steel hook, but he only succeeded in frightening some pelicans and teal, while tall flamingos stared stupidly at the party."
"最后，这些沼泽地的居民们也不见了。更矮一些的树木稀疏地分布在不很茂密的灌木林里——还有一些树丛离群索居地分布在无边无际的平原上，那里，受惊的鹿来回跑动。","At length these denizens of the swamps disappeared in their turn; smaller trees became thinly scattered among less dense thickets—a few isolated groups detached in the midst of endless plains over which ranged herds of startled deer."
"“总算找到了！”巴比康从马镫上站起身来叫道，“我们到松林地带了！”","“At last,” cried Barbicane, rising in his stirrups, “here we are at the region of pines!”"
"“是的！也是野人地带，“少校回答说。”","“Yes! and of savages too,” replied the major."
"这时，果然有几个塞米诺人远远地出现在地平线上，他们骑着快马冲来冲去，有的挥舞着长矛，有的在打枪，枪声低沉。然而，他们敌意的示威对巴比康和他的同伴们根本没有影响。","In fact, some Seminoles had just came in sight upon the horizon; they rode violently backward and forward on their fleet horses, brandishing their spears or discharging their guns with a dull report.These hostile demonstrations, however, had no effect upon Barbicane and his companions."
"这时，他们来到一片多石的高岗中央，太阳炙热地烤着地面。这片高岗是由一座相当高的土坡形成的，似乎可以说是向枪炮俱乐部的会员们提供了铸造哥伦比亚大炮的各种必要条件。","They were then occupying the center of a rocky plain, which the sun scorched with its parching rays.This was formed by a considerable elevation of the soil, which seemed to offer to the members of the Gun Club all the conditions requisite for the construction of their Columbiad."
"“停！”巴比康勒住马说，“这个地方在当地叫什么名？”","“Halt!” said Barbicane, reining up.Has this place any local appellation?”"
"“它叫乱石岗。”一个佛罗里达人回答。","“It is called Stones Hill,” replied one of the Floridans."
"巴比康什么也没说就下了马，取出仪器，开始极其准确地测定他所在的位置。这一小队人马停在他身后，静静地看着他的一举一动。","Barbicane, without saying a word, dismounted, seized his instruments, and began to note his position with extreme exactness.The little band, drawn up in the rear, watched his proceedings in profound silence."
"这时，太阳刚过了最高点。过了一小会儿，巴比康迅速记录下观测的结果，说：","At this moment the sun passed the meridian.Barbicane, after a few moments, rapidly wrote down the result of his observations, and said:"
"“这个地方海拔1,800英尺，位于北纬二十七度七分，西经五度七分，正好处于华盛顿所在的子午线上。”这里岩石很多、土壤贫瘠，为我们提供了实验必须的全部条件。在这片土地上，我们要建起仓库、工场、熔炉和工人们的棚屋，也就是从这里，”他把脚踏在乱石岗的最高点，说，“我们的炮弹将会飞入太阳系空间。”","“This spot is situated eighteen hundred feet above the level of the sea, in 27@ 7’ N. lat. and 5@ 7’ W. long. of the meridian of Washington.It appears to me by its rocky and barren character to offer all the conditions requisite for our experiment.On that plain will be raised our magazines, workshops, furnaces, and workmen’s huts; and here, from this very spot,” said he, stamping his foot on the summit of Stones Hill, “hence shall our projectile take its flight into the regions of the Solar World.”"
"第十四章 手镐和泥铲","CHAPTER XIV PICKAXE AND TROWEL"
"当天晚上，巴比康和他的伙伴返回坦帕城，工程师默奇森则再次乘上坦皮科号回新奥尔良去了。他的目标是招募一支工人大军，并把大部分的物资运到这里来。枪炮俱乐部的成员留在坦帕城，为的是在当地人的帮助下着手做些准备工作。","The same evening Barbicane and his companions returned to Tampa Town; and Murchison, the engineer, re-embarked on board the Tampico for New Orleans.His object was to enlist an army of workmen, and to collect together the greater part of the materials.The members of the Gun Club remained at Tampa Town, for the purpose of setting on foot the preliminary works by the aid of the people of the country."
"八天以后，坦皮科号带着一队汽船重返圣埃斯皮里图湾。默奇森成功招募到了1,500名工匠。由于受到枪炮俱乐部高薪酬、高奖金政策的吸引，他不计较肤色，精心挑选了众多的司炉工、冶金工、石灰窑工、矿工、制砖工，以及其他各行业的工匠。这些工匠中的很多人把家眷也带来了，简直就像一次大规模的移民。","Eight days after its departure, the Tampico returned into the bay of Espiritu Santo, with a whole flotilla of steamboats.Murchison had succeeded in assembling together fifteen hundred artisans.Attracted by the high pay and considerable bounties offered by the Gun Club, he had enlisted a choice legion of stokers, iron-founders, lime-burners, miners, brickmakers, and artisans of every trade, without distinction of color.As many of these people brought their families with them, their departure resembled a perfect emigration."
"10月31日上午10点，这支队伍踏上了坦帕城的码头。小城的人口一天之内就增加了一倍，可以想象当时全城的热闹景象。","On the 31st of October, at ten o’clock in the morning, the troop disembarked on the quays of Tampa Town; and one may imagine the activity which pervaded that little town, whose population was thus doubled in a single day."
"起初的几天，他们忙着卸用汽船运来的物资，其中有机械设备、给养和大量铁板做的临时房子，都被拆成了一块一块，编上了号码。与此同时，巴比康铺设了第一段15英里的铁轨枕木，打算把乱石岗和坦帕城连接起来。11月1日，巴比康带着一队工人离开了坦帕城。第二天，一座全是铁板房屋的小城就在乱石岗脚下建立起来了。他们给小城围了一圈栅栏；就这座城市蓬勃的活力来看，过不了多久它就会成为合众国的一个大都市了。　　　　　这里的一切都规划得井然有序，工作有条不紊地开展起来了。","During the first few days they were busy discharging the cargo brought by the flotilla, the machines, and the rations, as well as a large number of huts constructed of iron plates, separately pieced and numbered.At the same period Barbicane laid the first sleepers of a railway fifteen miles in length, intended to unite Stones Hill with Tampa Town.On the first of November Barbicane quitted Tampa Town with a detachment of workmen; and on the following day the whole town of huts was erected round Stones Hill.This they enclosed with palisades; and in respect of energy and activity, it might have been mistaken for one of the great cities of the Union.Everything was placed under a complete system of discipline, and the works were commenced in most perfect order."
"人们反复地仔细勘察了土质的方方面面，最终将挖掘定于11月4日开始。","The nature of the soil having been carefully examined, by means of repeated borings, the work of excavation was fixed for the 4th of November."
"那天，巴比康召集他的工头们，对他们说：“朋友们，你们都清楚我为什么把你们召集到佛罗里达的这片荒野上来。”我们的任务是制造一尊内径九英尺、壁厚六英尺的大炮，外面还有一层19.5英尺厚的石头护壁。因此，我们要挖掘一口直径60英尺、深900英尺的井。这项巨大的工程必须在八个月内完成，这样说来，你们必须在255天内挖土2,543,400立方英尺，每天大约要挖2,000立方尺。1,000个工人，如果在空地上工作的话，自然不会有什么难处，但在有限的空间里就比较困难了。然而，工作必须要做，以你们的勇气和技术，我相信你们一定能完成它。","On that day Barbicane called together his foremen and addressed them as follows: “You are well aware, my friends, of the object with which I have assembled you together in this wild part of Florida.Our business is to construct a cannon measuring nine feet in its interior diameter, six feet thick, and with a stone revetment of nineteen and a half feet in thickness.We have, therefore, a well of sixty feet in diameter to dig down to a depth of nine hundred feet.This great work must be completed within eight months, so that you have 2,543,400 cubic feet of earth to excavate in 255 days; that is to say, in round numbers, 2,000 cubic feet per day.That which would present no difficulty to a thousand navvies working in open country will be of course more troublesome in a comparatively confined space.However, the thing must be done, and I reckon for its accomplishment upon your courage as much as upon your skill.”"
"第二天上午八点，人们用手镐在佛罗里达的土地上掘了第一下。从那时起，矿工们手里的这件工具就片刻不停地挥舞着。工人们每三个小时轮班休息一次。","At eight o’clock the next morning the first stroke of the pickaxe was struck upon the soil of Florida; and from that moment that prince of tools was never inactive for one moment in the hands of the excavators.The gangs relieved each other every three hours."
"11月4日，50个工人在围栅正中心，也就是说在乱石岗的最高点，掘了一个直径60英尺的圆坑。手镐先碰到的是一层六英寸深的黑土，这一部分很快就被挖掉了。在这层土的下面是二尺深的细沙，都被小心地堆在一旁，因为这些沙子很有价值，可以用来铸造内部的模子。在沙层的下面是一层相当细的白色黏土，像英国的白垩粉，有四英尺深。接下来，手镐的尖碰到了坚硬的底层，这是一种由石化贝壳构成的岩石，又干又硬，很费力才能把它挖穿。这时，圆坑已经有六英尺半深，石工便开始工作了。","On the 4th of November fifty workmen commenced digging, in the very center of the enclosed space on the summit of Stones Hill, a circular hole sixty feet in diameter.The pickaxe first struck upon a kind of black earth, six inches in thickness, which was speedily disposed of.To this earth succeeded two feet of fine sand, which was carefully laid aside as being valuable for serving the casting of the inner mould.After the sand appeared some compact white clay, resembling the chalk of Great Britain, which extended down to a depth of four feet.Then the iron of the picks struck upon the hard bed of the soil; a kind of rock formed of petrified shells, very dry, very solid, and which the picks could with difficulty penetrate.At this point the excavation exhibited a depth of six and a half feet and the work of the masonry was begun."
"在挖出的坑的坑底，他们用橡木做了个轮子，这个轮子是用螺钉牢牢地钉起来的，结实无比。木轮盘的中心是空的，直径和哥伦比亚大炮的外径相等。紧挨着这个大轮子是第一层石料，用水凝水泥紧紧地砌在一起，极为坚固。工人们从外围向中心砌石头，最后形成了一口直径21英尺的井。这项工作完成之后，矿工们重新拿起手镐，开始刨大轮子底下的岩石，边刨边小心地把大轮子用结实无比的支架支起来。每挖两英尺深，他们就卸一次支架。大轮子就连带着周围厚厚的石料慢慢下降，泥瓦工不停地在轮子的上表面砌墙，并留出一些气孔，以便使铸造过程中产生的气体排出。","At the bottom of the excavation they constructed a wheel of oak, a kind of circle strongly bolted together, and of immense strength.The center of this wooden disc was hollowed out to a diameter equal to the exterior diameter of the Columbiad.Upon this wheel rested the first layers of the masonry, the stones of which were bound together by hydraulic cement, with irresistible tenacity.The workmen, after laying the stones from the circumference to the center, were thus enclosed within a kind of well twenty-one feet in diameter.When this work was accomplished, the miners resumed their picks and cut away the rock from underneath the wheel itself, taking care to support it as they advanced upon blocks of great thickness.At every two feet which the hole gained in depth they successively withdrew the blocks.The wheel then sank little by little, and with it the massive ring of masonry, on the upper bed of which the masons labored incessantly, always reserving some vent holes to permit the escape of gas during the operation of the casting."
"这种工作要求工人一丝不苟，全神贯注。不止一两个人在轮子底下挖掘时，被碎石严重击伤。但他们一直热情不减，不分昼夜地干着。白天，他们在炙热的太阳光下工作；晚上，他们在昏暗的电灯光下工作。手镐击打岩石的声音、开矿的爆破声、机器的轧轧声，还有空中的滚滚浓烟，仿佛在乱石岗四周划了一个恐怖的圆圈，无论是成群的野牛还是好战的塞米诺人都不敢越过界限。不过，由于起重机及时把废石运走，工作有条不紊地进行着。几乎没有什么出乎意料的障碍，至于预料之内的困难，他们也都迅速地解决了。","This kind of work required on the part of the workmen extreme nicety and minute attention.More than one, in digging underneath the wheel, was dangerously injured by the splinters of stone.But their ardor never relaxed, night or day.By day they worked under the rays of the scorching sun; by night, under the gleam of the electric light.The sounds of the picks against the rock, the bursting of mines, the grinding of the machines, the wreaths of smoke scattered through the air, traced around Stones Hill a circle of terror which the herds of buffaloes and the war parties of the Seminoles never ventured to pass.Nevertheless, the works advanced regularly, as the steam-cranes actively removed the rubbish.Of unexpected obstacles there was little account; and with regard to foreseen difficulties, they were speedily disposed of."
"第一个月结束的时候，井已经按照预定的进度，挖了112英尺深了。12月，井的深度变成了两倍，1月时，变成了三倍。","At the expiration of the first month the well had attained the depth assigned for that lapse of time, namely, 112 feet.This depth was doubled in December, and trebled in January."
"2月里，工人们不得不和外层土壤大面积的渗水展开斗争。工人们必须用大马力的抽水机和空气压缩机把水抽干，像堵船上漏水的裂缝一样堵住渗水口。最后，他们终于战胜了倔强的水流，但是由于泥土变松动，轮子也跟着松动了一些，造成了部分下陷。在这起事故中，几个工人丧失了生命。","During the month of February the workmen had to contend with a sheet of water which made its way right across the outer soil.It became necessary to employ very powerful pumps and compressed-air engines to drain it off, so as to close up the orifice from whence it issued; just as one stops a leak on board ship.They at last succeeded in getting the upper hand of these untoward streams; only, in consequence of the loosening of the soil, the wheel partly gave way, and a slight partial settlement ensued.This accident cost the life of several workmen."
"从那以后，便没有新的意外阻碍阻碍工程的进度了。6月10日，这口井已经有900英尺深，整个内壁都砌好了石头，这时距巴比康规定的时间还有20天。井壁下面是30英尺厚的地基，井口恰恰和地面齐平。","No fresh occurrence thenceforward arrested the progress of the operation; and on the tenth of June, twenty days before the expiration of the period fixed by Barbicane, the well, lined throughout with its facing of stone, had attained the depth of 900 feet.At the bottom the masonry rested upon a massive block measuring thirty feet in thickness, while on the upper portion it was level with the surrounding soil."
"巴比康主席和枪炮俱乐部的会员们对他们的工程师默奇森表示了热烈祝贺。这项艰巨的工作就这样以非凡的速度完成了。","President Barbicane and the members of the Gun Club warmly congratulated their engineer Murchison; the cyclopean work had been accomplished with extraordinary rapidity."
"在这八个月里，巴比康从未离开过乱石岗一刻。他一直关注着掘井工作，不停地为工人们的福利和健康奔忙，而且极其幸运地防止了容易在人口密集地区常发的传染病，这些病在受热带气候影响的地区特别可怕。","During these eight months Barbicane never quitted Stones Hill for a single instant.Keeping ever close by the work of excavation, he busied himself incessantly with the welfare and health of his workpeople, and was singularly fortunate in warding off the epidemics common to large communities of men, and so disastrous in those regions of the globe which are exposed to the influences of tropical climates."
"的确，有不少工人在这危险的劳动中由于一时疏忽葬送了自己的生命；但是这些小灾小患实在是无法避免的，此等小事美国人是不大在乎的。事实上，比起关心某个个体，他们更关心整个人类。","Many workmen, it is true, paid with their lives for the rashness inherent in these dangerous labors; but these mishaps are impossible to be avoided, and they are classed among the details with which the Americans trouble themselves but little.They have in fact more regard for human nature in general than for the individual in particular."
"不过，巴比康却声称他反对这种看法，而且一遇到机会就大力推行自己的主张。因此，多亏巴比康的细心和聪明，他在发生一切困难时的有效干涉，以及他超乎常人的仁慈和睿智，平均工伤数才没有超过大西洋彼岸那些以极度注重安全防范著称的国家——比方说法国，在那里，差不多20万法郎的工程就会产生一件事故。","Nevertheless, Barbicane professed opposite principles to these, and put them in force at every opportunity.So, thanks to his care, his intelligence, his useful intervention in all difficulties, his prodigious and humane sagacity, the average of accidents did not exceed that of transatlantic countries, noted for their excessive precautions—France, for instance, among others, where they reckon about one accident for every two hundred thousand francs of work."
"第十五章 铸炮节","CHAPTER XV THE FETE OF THE CASTING"
"在掘井的这八个月期间，铸炮的准备工作也在极其迅速地进行着。一个外地人来到乱石岗，一定会对眼前的景象惊奇不已。","During the eight months which were employed in the work of excavation the preparatory works of the casting had been carried on simultaneously with extreme rapidity.A stranger arriving at Stones Hill would have been surprised at the spectacle offered to his view."
"1，200座反射炉矗立在距井600码远的地方，以井为中心围成一圈，每座反射炉直径6英尺，两两相距3英尺。这1,200座反射炉组成的圆圈周长足有两英里。这些反射炉都是按照同样的设计建造的，都有一根四角形的高烟囱，看起来十分奇特。","At 600 yards from the well, and circularly arranged around it as a central point, rose 1,200 reverberating ovens, each six feet in diameter, and separated from each other by an interval of three feet.The circumference occupied by these 1,200 ovens presented a length of two miles.Being all constructed on the same plan, each with its high quadrangular chimney, they produced a most singular effect."
"记得在第三次会议上，委员会曾经决定用铸铁来铸哥伦比亚大炮，而且特别指出要用灰铁。确实，这种金属的韧性、延展性和可塑性都是最好的，因此适用于所有浇铸工作。而且，和炭一起熔炼之后，其上乘的质地可用于铸造一切需要强抵抗力的机械，如大炮、锅炉、液压机等。","It will be remembered that on their third meeting the committee had decided to use cast iron for the Columbiad, and in particular the white description.This metal, in fact, is the most tenacious, the most ductile, and the most malleable, and consequently suitable for all moulding operations; and when smelted with pit coal, is of superior quality for all engineering works requiring great resisting power, such as cannon, steam boilers, hydraulic presses, and the like."
"然而，铸铁如果只被熔炼一次，其质地很难达到充分的纯净，因此，必须经过第二次熔炼，除去最后的矿渣，才能完全提炼干净。所以，在运送到坦帕城之前，铁矿石要先在科尔德斯普林的大高炉里熔炼一次，使其在高温下同炭和硅接触，经过碳化，最后变成铸铁。经过这第一项处理之后，铸铁才被送到乱石岗。但是，如果用火车运输这136,000,000磅铸铁的话，所需的费用就太高了。运费将是货物价格的两倍。看起来，在纽约租船装运铁锭更为合算。不过，这样就需要至少68条1,000吨位的船。5月3日，一支名副其实的舰队驶离了纽约，又于当月10日驶入圣埃斯皮里图湾，并在坦帕城的港口将货物完好无损地卸下。此后，这些铁又通过铁路被运往乱石岗，大约在1月中旬，这批体积庞大的金属最终被运送至目的地。","Cast iron, however, if subjected to only one single fusion, is rarely sufficiently homogeneous; and it requires a second fusion completely to refine it by dispossessing it of its last earthly deposits.So long before being forwarded to Tampa Town, the iron ore, molten in the great furnaces of Coldspring, and brought into contact with coal and silicium heated to a high temperature, was carburized and transformed into cast iron.After this first operation, the metal was sent on to Stones Hill.They had, however, to deal with 136,000,000 pounds of iron, a quantity far too costly to send by railway.The cost of transport would have been double that of material.It appeared preferable to freight vessels at New York, and to load them with the iron in bars.This, however, required not less than sixty-eight vessels of 1,000 tons, a veritable fleet, which, quitting New York on the 3rd of May, on the 10th of the same month ascended the Bay of Espiritu Santo, and discharged their cargoes, without dues, in the port at Tampa Town.Thence the iron was transported by rail to Stones Hill, and about the middle of January this enormous mass of metal was delivered at its destination."
"不难理解，想要同时熔炼这60,000吨铁，1,200座熔炉并不算多。每一座熔炉可以容纳将近14万磅的金属。它们都是按照锻造罗德曼大炮的熔炉的样式建造的，炉身呈梯形，高高的拱顶呈椭圆形。这些熔炉是用防火砖砌的，尤其适合燃烧矿煤，并有一个平坦的底架，用来放铁锭。这个底架倾斜成25度角，这样金属熔化后就会流入接收槽内，这1,200股金属熔浆就从那里流入中央的井里。","It will easily be understood that 1,200 furnaces were not too many to melt simultaneously these 60,000 tons of iron.Each of these furnaces contained nearly 140,000 pounds weight of metal.They were all built after the model of those which served for the casting of the Rodman gun; they were trapezoidal in shape, with a high elliptical arch.These furnaces, constructed of fireproof brick, were especially adapted for burning pit coal, with a flat bottom upon which the iron bars were laid.This bottom, inclined at an angle of 25 degrees, allowed the metal to flow into the receiving troughs; and the 1,200 converging trenches carried the molten metal down to the central well."
"在掘井和砌井壁工作结束的第二天，巴比康便着手建砂模了。他要在井正中建一个高九百英尺、直径九英尺、与井同轴的圆柱体，这样就正好填满了留给哥伦比亚炮内腔的空间。这个圆柱体是用掺了干草和麦秆的黏土及沙石做成的。砂模和井壁中间的空隙是用来盛放金属熔浆的，这样就形成了六英尺厚的炮筒。为了保持平衡，这个圆柱体必须用铁圈箍起来，每隔一定的间隔用楔入井壁的铁梁支撑着。炮筒铸好以后，这些铁梁就会和金属熔浆融为一体，外表看不出来任何痕迹。","The day following that on which the works of the masonry and boring had been completed, Barbicane set to work upon the central mould.His object now was to raise within the center of the well, and with a coincident axis, a cylinder 900 feet high, and nine feet in diameter, which should exactly fill up the space reserved for the bore of the Columbiad.This cylinder was composed of a mixture of clay and sand, with the addition of a little hay and straw.The space left between the mould and the masonry was intended to be filled up by the molten metal, which would thus form the walls six feet in thickness.This cylinder, in order to maintain its equilibrium, had to be bound by iron bands, and firmly fixed at certain intervals by cross-clamps fastened into the stone lining; after the castings these would be buried in the block of metal, leaving no external projection."
"这项工程已于7月8日竣工，于是决定第二天开始铸炮。","This operation was completed on the 8th of July, and the run of the metal was fixed for the following day."
"“这个铸炮节应该好好庆祝一下。”马斯顿对他的朋友巴比康说。","“This fete of the casting will be a grand ceremony,” said J. T. Maston to his friend Barbicane."
"“没问题，”巴比康回答道，“不过，这可不是一个公众的节日。”","“Undoubtedly,” said Barbicane; “but it will not be a public fete.”"
"“怎么！你不打算敞开大门欢迎所有人么？”","“What! will you not open the gates of the enclosure to all comers?”"
"“我必须得谨慎，马斯顿。铸造哥伦比亚大炮虽然不能说是一件危险的事，却是一件需要特别谨慎处理的事，我宁愿让它关着门进行。发射炮弹的时候如果你想庆祝是可以的——那之前可不行！”","“I must be very careful, Maston.The casting of the Columbiad is an extremely delicate, not to say a dangerous operation, and I should prefer its being done privately.At the discharge of the projectile, a fete if you like—till then, no!”"
"主席说的有道理。这项工程隐藏着无法预见的危险，大批前来参观的群众势必会阻碍巴比康排灾解难。所以，保持行动自由是必要的。除了一个由枪炮俱乐部会员组成的远道而来的代表团以外，任何人都不准进入围栏。这个代表团里有精神焕发的倍尔斯贝，汤姆·亨特，布鲁姆斯伯里上校，埃尔芬斯通少校，摩根将军及其他一些以铸哥伦比亚大炮为己任的人。J.T.马斯顿成了他们的向导。他不放过任何一个细节，带领他们视察仓库、工场、机器，还强迫他们把1,200座熔炉一座接一座都参观了。当他们参观完最后一个熔铁炉时，已经筋疲力尽了。","The president was right.The operation involved unforeseen dangers, which a great influx of spectators would have hindered him from averting.It was necessary to preserve complete freedom of movement.No one was admitted within the enclosure except a delegation of members of the Gun Club, who had made the voyage to Tampa Town.Among these was the brisk Bilsby, Tom Hunter, Colonel Blomsberry, Major Elphinstone, General Morgan, and the rest of the lot to whom the casting of the Columbiad was a matter of personal interest.J. T. Maston became their cicerone.He omitted no point of detail; he conducted them throughout the magazines, workshops, through the midst of the engines, and compelled them to visit the whole 1,200 furnaces one after the other.At the end of the twelve-hundredth visit they were pretty well knocked up."
"铸炮的时间是12点整。前一晚，每一座熔炉里都装了114,000磅铁锭，这些铁锭两两交叉排列着，这样热气就可以在空隙间自由流通。黎明时，1,200座烟囱就不断向天空喷射火焰，大地也在微微颤动。要熔化多少磅的金属，就要燃烧多少磅的煤。于是，68,000吨煤冲着太阳喷出了大幕般的浓烟。一圈熔炉发出雷鸣般的隆隆声，很快，圈内的温度已经高得让人难以承受了。强大的排风扇不停地吹着，把充分的氧气供应给白热的炉火。这项工作要想成功，就必须得动作快。炮声一响，每一座熔炉便要把铁水完全倾倒出去。一切准备就绪，工头和工人们都焦急而又略带激动地等待着预定时刻的到来。围栏里已经没有人了。每位负责人都在熔浆槽边就位。","The casting was to take place at twelve o’clock precisely.The previous evening each furnace had been charged with 114,000 pounds weight of metal in bars disposed cross-ways to each other, so as to allow the hot air to circulate freely between them.At daybreak the 1,200 chimneys vomited their torrents of flame into the air, and the ground was agitated with dull tremblings.As many pounds of metal as there were to cast, so many pounds of coal were there to burn.Thus there were 68,000 tons of coal which projected in the face of the sun a thick curtain of smoke.The heat soon became insupportable within the circle of furnaces, the rumbling of which resembled the rolling of thunder.The powerful ventilators added their continuous blasts and saturated with oxygen the glowing plates.The operation, to be successful, required to be conducted with great rapidity.On a signal given by a cannon-shot each furnace was to give vent to the molten iron and completely to empty itself.These arrangements made, foremen and workmen waited the preconcerted moment with an impatience mingled with a certain amount of emotion.Not a soul remained within the enclosure.Each superintendent took his post by the aperture of the run."
"巴比康和他的同伴们站在附近的一片高地上，监督整个操作过程。他们前面放着一尊大炮，工程师一发信号就开炮。差几分钟十二点的时候，少许的铁水开始往外流，贮液器一点点地被填满，当铁完全熔化后，铁水要在贮液器里停留一会儿，这样就能更容易地把杂质分离出来。","Barbicane and his colleagues, perched on a neighboring eminence, assisted at the operation.In front of them was a piece of artillery ready to give fire on the signal from the engineer.Some minutes before midday the first driblets of metal began to flow; the reservoirs filled little by little; and, by the time that the whole melting was completely accomplished, it was kept in abeyance for a few minutes in order to facilitate the separation of foreign substances."
"12点到了！突然一声炮响，一道火光射向天空。1,200个溶液槽同时打开，于是1,200条火蛇像一条条白热的曲线，涌向井中央。铁水流进900英尺深的井里，发出巨大的噪音。这是一个多么令人兴奋的壮观景象啊。铁浪把滚滚浓烟射向天空，砂模里的水分蒸发了，并穿过底架的排气孔变成厚厚的蒸气云窜了出来，在这个过程中，大地都颤抖了。这些人造云翻滚上升到1,000码的高空。一个在地平线的尽头流浪的野人，可能会认为佛罗里达州的地底下正在形成一座新的火山呢。但是，这既不是火山喷发、台风、暴风雨，亦或是恶劣天气的侵扰，也不是自然界所能产生的任何可怕现象。都不是。这些淡红色的水蒸气、火山般的万丈火焰、地震般的巨大震动、狂风暴雨般的轰鸣声，都是人类一手创造出来的，是人类亲手把铁水瀑布倾注到他们亲手挖掘的深渊里制造出的声音。","Twelve o’clock struck!A gunshot suddenly pealed forth and shot its flame into the air.Twelve hundred melting-troughs were simultaneously opened and twelve hundred fiery serpents crept toward the central well, unrolling their incandescent curves.There, down they plunged with a terrific noise into a depth of 900 feet.It was an exciting and a magnificent spectacle.The ground trembled, while these molten waves, launching into the sky their wreaths of smoke, evaporated the moisture of the mould and hurled it upward through the vent-holes of the stone lining in the form of dense vapor-clouds.These artificial clouds unrolled their thick spirals to a height of 1,000 yards into the air. A savage, wandering somewhere beyond the limits of the horizon, might have believed that some new crater was forming in the bosom of Florida, although there was neither any eruption, nor typhoon, nor storm, nor struggle of the elements, nor any of those terrible phenomena which nature is capable of producing.No, it was man alone who had produced these reddish vapors, these gigantic flames worthy of a volcano itself, these tremendous vibrations resembling the shock of an earthquake, these reverberations rivaling those of hurricanes and storms; and it was his hand which precipitated into an abyss, dug by himself, a whole Niagara of molten metal!"
"第十六章 哥伦比亚大炮","CHAPTER XVI THE COLUMBIAD"
"铸炮成功了吗？大家所能做的只剩下推测。事实上，既然砂模已经吸收了全部的铁水，那么大家完全有理由认为铸炮已经成功了。不过，不管怎么说，要想证实这个问题还需要很长的时间。","Had the casting succeeded?They were reduced to mere conjecture.There was indeed every reason to expect success, since the mould has absorbed the entire mass of the molten metal; still some considerable time must elapse before they could arrive at any certainty upon the matter."
"在这段时间里，枪炮俱乐部成员们的耐心受到了极大的考验。但是，他们什么也做不了。J. T. 马斯顿奇迹般地没有被烤焦。铸炮结束15天后，空中仍飘着一团巨大的烟柱，乱石岗周围200英尺的地方仍热得烫脚。想要再走近些是不可能的。他们能做的只有尽可能地耐心等待。","The patience of the members of the Gun Club was sorely tried during this period of time.But they could do nothing.J. T. Maston escaped roasting by a miracle.Fifteen days after the casting an immense column of smoke was still rising in the open sky and the ground burned the soles of the feet within a radius of two hundred feet round the summit of Stones Hill.It was impossible to approach nearer.All they could do was to wait with what patience they might."
"“现在已经是8月10日了，”一天早上马斯顿说，“离12月1日只有4个月了！我们来不及了！”巴比康什么也没说，但他是用沉默掩饰着强烈的怒火。","“Here we are at the 10th of August,” exclaimed J. T. Maston one morning, “only four months to the 1st of December!We shall never be ready in time!” Barbicane said nothing, but his silence covered serious irritation."
"不过，日常的观察显示，土壤的情况有了一定的变化。8月15日前后，喷射出来的水蒸气在密度和浓度上都有很大程度的降低。又过了几天，地面只冒出小股小股的烟了，这就是石头圈中央那个怪物的最后一丝气息。热的地区在一点点缩小，到了8月22日，巴比康、他的同事以及工程师就可以站在与乱石岗顶峰齐平的铁皮上了。","However, daily observations revealed a certain change going on in the state of the ground.About the 15th of August the vapors ejected had sensibly diminished in intensity and thickness.Some days afterward the earth exhaled only a slight puff of smoke, the last breath of the monster enclosed within its circle of stone.Little by little the belt of heat contracted, until on the 22nd of August, Barbicane, his colleagues, and the engineer were enabled to set foot on the iron sheet which lay level upon the summit of Stones Hill."
"“终于成功了！”枪炮俱乐部的主席长舒了一口气说道。","“At last!” exclaimed the president of the Gun Club, with an immense sigh of relief."
"当天，工程就重新开工了。为了清理大炮的炮筒，他们立刻着手挖掉炮筒内的砂模。手镐和螺旋钻一刻不停地工作着。黏土和沙子在热力的作用下，变得极其坚硬，但是，在机器的帮助下，挖掘出来的垃圾很快地被装上火车运走了。大家干得如此热火朝天，巴比康主席的美元论是如此有说服力，以至于到了９月３日，砂模的残迹已经完全不见了。","The work was resumed the same day. They proceeded at once to extract the interior mould, for the purpose of clearing out the boring of the piece.Pickaxes and boring irons were set to work without intermission.The clayey and sandy soils had acquired extreme hardness under the action of the heat; but, by the aid of the machines, the rubbish on being dug out was rapidly carted away on railway wagons; and such was the ardor of the work, so persuasive the arguments of Barbicane’s dollars, that by the 3rd of September all traces of the mould had entirely disappeared."
"随后，打磨炮膛的工作立即开始。几星期后，在威力强大的机器的协助下，这个巨大炮管的内壁就已呈完美的圆柱形，整个炮膛被磨得光滑无比。","Immediately the operation of boring was commenced; and by the aid of powerful machines, a few weeks later, the inner surface of the immense tube had been rendered perfectly cylindrical, and the bore of the piece had acquired a thorough polish."
"终于，在9月22日，这尊巨大武器的口径已经与规定的数值分毫不差，炮筒与地面完全垂直地竖立着，可以投入使用了。这时离巴比康最初的提案还不到一年时间。现在只需等待月球到达指定位置了，他们十分肯定，她是不会失约的。","At length, on the 22d of September, less than a twelvemonth after Barbicane’s original proposition, the enormous weapon, accurately bored, and exactly vertically pointed, was ready for work.There was only the moon now to wait for; and they were pretty sure that she would not fail in the rendezvous."
"J. T. 马斯顿欣喜若狂，当他向下注视炮筒的时候，差点没掉下去。要不是布鲁姆斯伯里上校一把拉住他，这位可敬的枪炮俱乐部的秘书就会成为现代版的艾罗斯特拉特，死在哥伦比亚大炮的底部了。","The ecstasy of J. T. Maston knew no bounds, and he narrowly escaped a frightful fall while staring down the tube.But for the strong hand of Colonel Blomsberry, the worthy secretary, like a modern Erostratus, would have found his death in the depths of the Columbiad."
"大炮已经竣工，对于它能否顺利完工已经不用再怀疑了。因此，10月6日，尼科尔上校不得不在自己的账簿上记上欠巴比康2,000美元。可以想象，尼科尔上校已经怒火中烧，几乎快要抓狂了。不过，他还有3,000、4,000、5,000美元三笔赌注，哪怕能够赢得其中两笔，他的处境就不算太坏。但是，他考虑的并不是钱的问题。他的对手成功地铸了一尊连60英尺厚的钢板都能击穿的大炮，这给了他一个可怕的打击。","The cannon was then finished; there was no possible doubt as to its perfect completion.So, on the 6th of October, Captain Nicholl opened an account between himself and President Barbicane, in which he debited himself to the latter in the sum of two thousand dollars.One may believe that the captain’s wrath was increased to its highest point, and must have made him seriously ill. However, he had still three bets of three, four, and five thousand dollars, respectively; and if he gained two out of these, his position would not be very bad. But the money question did not enter into his calculations; it was the success of his rival in casting a cannon against which iron plates sixty feet thick would have been ineffectual, that dealt him a terrible blow."
"9月23日之后，乱石岗敞开围栏，开始对公众开放，不难想象人们争先恐后赶来参观的场景。当地人和从外地来到坦帕城的人从来没有间断过，看起来就像队列游行一样，或者更确切地说，像朝拜一样。","After the 23rd of September the enclosure of Stones hill was thrown open to the public; and it will be easily imagined what was the concourse of visitors to this spot!There was an incessant flow of people to and from Tampa Town and the place, which resembled a procession, or rather, in fact, a pilgrimage."
"很明显，实验当天将会有数以百万的参观者，因为他们已经从世界各地来到了这座狭长的半岛。欧洲都快被迁移到美国了。","It was already clear to be seen that, on the day of the experiment itself, the aggregate of spectators would be counted by millions; for they were already arriving from all parts of the earth upon this narrow strip of promontory.Europe was emigrating to America."
"然而，我们必须承认，到目前为止众多参观者的好奇心还没有得到充分的满足。大多数人都指望能一睹铸炮的壮观场景，但是除了烟，他们什么也没看到。这对他们贪婪的双眼来说，实在不过瘾。但是，巴比康不允许任何人参观这项工作。继而，人群中怨声四起，大家嘟嘟囔囔地抱怨起来，指责主席太独断专行。人们声称他的做法“没有美国味儿”。乱石岗的外围差点发生暴乱，但是巴比康仍然没有改变主意。不过，到哥伦比亚大炮完工的时候，栅栏门就关不住了。此时要是再激起群众的不满，就是不识趣、甚至是太鲁莽了。因此，巴比康向所有参观者敞开了大门，不过，基于他的现实主义精神，他打算利用群众的好奇心捞点油水。","Up to that time, however, it must be confessed, the curiosity of the numerous comers was but scantily gratified.Most had counted upon witnessing the spectacle of the casting, and they were treated to nothing but smoke.This was sorry food for hungry eyes; but Barbicane would admit no one to that operation.Then ensued grumbling, discontent, murmurs; they blamed the president, taxed him with dictatorial conduct.His proceedings were declared “un-American.” There was very nearly a riot round Stones Hill; but Barbicane remained inflexible.When, however, the Columbiad was entirely finished, this state of closed doors could no longer be maintained; besides it would have been bad taste, and even imprudence, to affront the public feeling.Barbicane, therefore, opened the enclosure to all comers; but, true to his practical disposition, he determined to coin money out of the public curiosity."
"的确，能够好好看看这尊巨大的哥伦比亚大炮已经很了不起了，如果还能下到炮底，那对于美国人来说似乎就是人世间最幸福的事了。因此，不少好奇的参观者都想到这金属制成的深渊里参观一番。几只悬在蒸气起重机上的吊篮满足了他们的好奇心。那可真叫狂热啊！所有的女人、小孩、老人都把窥探巨炮的神秘当作自己的义务。下到炮底的费用定为每人五美元，尽管价格很高，但在实验开始前的两个月里，大量的参观者给枪炮俱乐部带来了近50万美元的收益！","It was something, indeed, to be enabled to contemplate this immense Columbiad; but to descend into its depths, this seemed to the Americans the ne plus ultra of earthly felicity.Consequently, there was not one curious spectator who was not willing to give himself the treat of visiting the interior of this great metallic abyss.Baskets suspended from steam-cranes permitted them to satisfy their curiosity.There was a perfect mania.Women, children, old men, all made it a point of duty to penetrate the mysteries of the colossal gun. The fare for the descent was fixed at five dollars per head; and despite this high charge, during the two months which preceded the experiment, the influx of visitors enabled the Gun Club to pocket nearly five hundred thousand dollars!"
"不用说，第一批参观哥伦比亚大炮的人是枪炮俱乐部的会员们。对于这么一个杰出的团体，这样的优待是理所应当的。仪式在9月25日举行。一只特别的吊篮把巴比康主席、J. T. 马斯顿、埃尔芬斯通中校、布鲁姆斯伯里上校以及其他俱乐部成员一起放了下去，一共是10个人。长炮筒的底端还是那么热！他们有点喘不过起来。但是，他们是多么高兴啊！多么欣喜若狂啊！哥伦比亚大炮的底部由大块的石头构成，石头上有一张摆放着六套餐具的桌子，一只射灯照亮了这里，光线和日光一样明亮。一道道仿佛从天而降的精美菜肴，接连不断地送到客人们面前，一瓶瓶法国最好的葡萄酒源源不断地供应给这地下900英尺的盛宴。","It is needless to say that the first visitors of the Columbiad were the members of the Gun Club.This privilege was justly reserved for that illustrious body.The ceremony took place on the 25th of September.A basket of honor took down the president, J. T. Maston, Major Elphinstone, General Morgan, Colonel Blomsberry, and other members of the club, to the number of ten in all. How hot it was at the bottom of that long tube of metal!They were half suffocated.But what delight!What ecstasy!A table had been laid with six covers on the massive stone which formed the bottom of the Columbiad, and lighted by a jet of electric light resembling that of day itself.Numerous exquisite dishes, which seemed to descend from heaven, were placed successively before the guests, and the richest wines of France flowed in profusion during this splendid repast, served nine hundred feet beneath the surface of the earth!"
"盛宴的气氛很活跃，甚至可以说是有点吵闹。大家频频地来回祝酒。他们为地球、为她的卫星、为枪炮俱乐部、为合众国、为月球、为黛安娜、为福柏、为塞勒涅、为“夜晚的和平使者”干杯！所有的欢呼声都向上传到了这只巨大声管顶端，音量被扩大得如同雷鸣。于是，乱石岗周围聚集的人群也和在哥伦比亚大炮底部聚餐的十个人一道，齐声欢呼。","The festival was animated, not to say somewhat noisy.Toasts flew backward and forward.They drank to the earth and to her satellite, to the Gun Club, the Union, the Moon, Diana, Phoebe, Selene, the “peaceful courier of the night!” All the hurrahs, carried upward upon the sonorous waves of the immense acoustic tube, arrived with the sound of thunder at its mouth; and the multitude ranged round Stones Hill heartily united their shouts with those of the ten revelers hidden from view at the bottom of the gigantic Columbiad."
"J. T. 马斯顿再也控制不住自己了。他到底是喊得最多，比划得最多，喝得最多，还是吃得最多，已经很难判断了。不管怎样，就算给他一个帝国，他也不愿意交换他现在这个位子。“哪怕现在有一门装好弹药的大炮，马上就要开炮把他炸成碎片送上太空，他也不换！”","J. T. Maston was no longer master of himself.Whether he shouted or gesticulated, ate or drank most, would be a difficult matter to determine.At all events, he would not have given his place up for an empire, “not even if the cannon—loaded, primed, and fired at that very moment—were to blow him in pieces into the planetary world.”"
"第十七章 一封电报","CHAPTER XVII A TELEGRAPHIC DISPATCH"
"枪炮俱乐部进行的这项伟大的工程终于接近尾声了，距离向月球发射炮弹的那一天还有两个月。相对于大家焦急的心情而言，这两个月简直就和两年一样长啊！迄今为止，每一天工程的每一个最小的细节都会登在各种杂志上，公众用充满期待的双眼关注着这些报道。","The great works undertaken by the Gun Club had now virtually come to an end; and two months still remained before the day for the discharge of the shot to the moon.To the general impatience these two months appeared as long as years!Hitherto the smallest details of the operation had been daily chronicled by the journals, which the public devoured with eager eyes."
"就在这个时候，一件最出人意料、最超乎寻常、最令人难以置信的事情发生了，它重新唤醒了人们悸动的心，把他们推入狂热的浪潮里。","Just at this moment a circumstance, the most unexpected, the most extraordinary and incredible, occurred to rouse afresh their panting spirits, and to throw every mind into a state of the most violent excitement."
"9月30日下午3点47分，从瓦伦西亚岛（爱尔兰）到纽芬兰和美国大陆的海底电缆传来了一份电报，电报被送到了巴比康主席的住处。","One day, the 30th of September, at 3:47 P.M., a telegram, transmitted by cable from Valentia (Ireland) to Newfoundland and the American Mainland, arrived at the address of President Barbicane."
"主席打开信封开始读电报，尽管他的自制力极强，但是读完这封只有二十几个字的电报，还是禁不住嘴唇发白，双眼模糊。","The president tore open the envelope, read the dispatch, and, despite his remarkable powers of self-control, his lips turned pale and his eyes grew dim, on reading the twenty words of this telegram."
"这封电报现在被放在枪炮俱乐部的档案室内，全文如下：","Here is the text of the dispatch, which figures now in the archives of the Gun Club:"
"法国，巴黎，9月30日，上午4时美国，佛罗里达州，坦帕城，巴比康","FRANCE, PARIS, 30 September, 4 A.M.Barbicane, Tampa Town, Florida, United States."
"请用圆锥体的炮弹代替球体炮弹。我要进入炮弹。我将乘亚特兰大号汽船赴美。米歇尔·阿当","Substitute for your spherical shell a cylindro-conical projectile.I shall go inside.Shall arrive by steamer Atlanta.MICHEL ARDAN."
"第十八章 亚特兰大号上的乘客","CHAPTER XVIII THE PASSENGER OF THE ATLANTA"
"假如这个令人震惊的消息不是通过电缆传来的，而是用普通的密封信封邮寄来的，巴比康就一刻都不会迟疑了。他就会绝口不提这个消息，这既是出于审慎，也是为了不再更改他的计划。这封电报可能是一个恶作剧，况且它还是个法国人发来的。什么人会想出这么个去月球旅行的主意呢？就算真有这样的人，那他也一定是个白痴，应该被关在疯人院，而不是呆在炮弹里。","If this astounding news, instead of flying through the electric wires, had simply arrived by post in the ordinary sealed envelope, Barbicane would not have hesitated a moment.He would have held his tongue about it, both as a measure of prudence, and in order not to have to reconsider his plans.This telegram might be a cover for some jest, especially as it came from a Frenchman.What human being would ever have conceived the idea of such a journey? and, if such a person really existed, he must be an idiot, whom one would shut up in a lunatic ward, rather than within the walls of the projectile."
"然而，信的内容很快就有人知道了，因为电报传送员丝毫没有保密意识。米歇尔·阿当的提议就这样立刻在合众国的几个州传开了。于是，巴比康没有理由再保持沉默了。他把此时在坦帕城的同僚召集到一起，没有提出任何自己的看法，只是把这份简洁的电报读了一遍。每个人都以各种方式对这封电报的内容表示疑问、怀疑和嘲笑，只有J. T. 马斯顿除外。他叫道：“不管怎么说，这倒是一个好主意！”","The contents of the dispatch, however, speedily became known; for the telegraphic officials possessed but little discretion, and Michel Ardan’s proposition ran at once throughout the several States of the Union.Barbicane, had, therefore, no further motives for keeping silence.Consequently, he called together such of his colleagues as were at the moment in Tampa Town, and without any expression of his own opinions simply read to them the laconic text itself.It was received with every possible variety of expressions of doubt, incredulity, and derision from every one, with the exception of J. T. Maston, who exclaimed, “It is a grand idea, however!”"
"巴比康最初提议向月球发射一颗炮弹的时候，每个人都认为这个计划易于操作、合理可行，因为它只不过是一个枪炮制造学的问题。而现在，当一个号称有理智的人打算进入炮弹旅行的时候，整件事就变成了一出闹剧，或者用一句俗语来说，就是“胡说八道”。","When Barbicane originally proposed to send a shot to the moon every one looked upon the enterprise as simple and practicable enough—a mere question of gunnery; but when a person, professing to be a reasonable being, offered to take passage within the projectile, the whole thing became a farce, or, in plainer language a humbug."
"但是，还有一个问题。这个人真的存在么？这封穿过大西洋深处传来的电报，这个法国人所乘坐的轮船的名字和他马上到达的日期，所有的信息都表明这个提议具有一定的真实性。他们必须弄清这件事情。三五成群的探究者们最终聚到一起，向巴比康主席的住所走去。而这位可敬的人物一直保持沉默，观望事态的发展。但是，他没有把群众的急躁考虑进去。此刻，他正沉着脸，看着聚集在他窗下的坦帕群众。群众们的窃窃私语和高声叫喊很快就迫使巴比康现身了。他来到群众面前，众人一安静下来，就有一位公民直截了当地问：“电报里提到的米歇尔·阿当，是不是已经启程赶往这里了？到底是不是？”","One question, however, remained.Did such a being exist?This telegram flashed across the depths of the Atlantic, the designation of the vessel on board which he was to take his passage, the date assigned for his speedy arrival, all combined to impart a certain character of reality to the proposal.They must get some clearer notion of the matter.Scattered groups of inquirers at length condensed themselves into a compact crowd, which made straight for the residence of President Barbicane.That worthy individual was keeping quiet with the intention of watching events as they arose.But he had forgotten to take into account the public impatience; and it was with no pleasant countenance that he watched the population of Tampa Town gathering under his windows.The murmurs and vociferations below presently obliged him to appear.He came forward, therefore, and on silence being procured, a citizen put point-blank to him the following question: “Is the person mentioned in the telegram, under the name of Michel Ardan, on his way here?Yes or no.”"
"“先生们，”巴比康回答道，”我知道的并不比你们多。“","“Gentlemen,” replied Barbicane, “I know no more than you do.”"
"“我们必须要知情。”人们不耐烦地喊道。","“We must know,” roared the impatient voices."
"“时间会告诉我们一切。”主席冷静地说。","“Time will show,” calmly replied the president."
"“但时间没有理由让整个国家的人悬着心。”群众代表回答道，“你根据电报的要求改变炮弹的设计图了么？”","“Time has no business to keep a whole country in suspense,” replied the orator.“Have you altered the plans of the projectile according to the request of the telegram?”"
"“还没有，先生们。但是你们说的没错！我们必须弄清楚事实。电报局有责任给我们提供最完整的信息。”","“Not yet, gentlemen; but you are right! we must have better information to go by. The telegraph must complete its information.”"
"“去电报局！”群众们喊道。","“To the telegraph!” roared the crowd."
"巴比康走下台阶，带领着庞大的队伍向电报局走去。几分钟后，大家把一封电报发给了利物浦船舶经纪人协会的理事长，要求他回答如下问题：","Barbicane descended; and heading the immense assemblage, led the way to the telegraph office.A few minutes later a telegram was dispatched to the secretary of the underwriters at Liverpool, requesting answers to the following queries:"
"“关于亚特兰大号——船是什么时候离开欧洲的？船上是否有一个叫米歇尔·阿当的法国人？”","“About the ship Atlanta—when did she leave Europe?Had she on board a Frenchman named Michel Ardan?”"
"两个小时后，巴比康收到了准确无误的消息，这个消息使得大家再也没有一丝怀疑的余地。","Two hours afterward Barbicane received information too exact to leave room for the smallest remaining doubt."
"“从利物浦出发的亚特兰大号轮船于10月2日启程，驶向坦帕城，船上有一名法国人，乘客名单表上他的名字是米歇尔·阿当。”","“The steamer Atlanta from Liverpool put to sea on the 2nd of October, bound for Tampa Town, having on board a Frenchman borne on the list of passengers by the name of Michel Ardan.”"
"当天晚上，巴比康给布理仕威尔公司写了一封信，要求他们在接到新的指令之前，暂停制造炮弹。10月10日上午9点，巴哈马运河上的信号装置在地平线上发出了一道浓烟。两个小时后，一艘大汽船和他们交换了信号。亚特兰大号的名字立刻在坦帕城传开了。四点钟，这艘英国轮船驶入了圣埃斯皮里图湾的水道。五点钟，船全速驶过希尔斯巴勒湾。六点钟，船抛锚停在坦帕港。铁锚还没有抓住海底的沙子，就有500艘船把亚特兰大号团团围住了。巴比康是第一个走上甲板的人，他的叫声里有着掩盖不住的激动：“米歇尔·阿当！”","That very evening he wrote to the house of Breadwill and Co., requesting them to suspend the casting of the projectile until the receipt of further orders.On the 10th of October, at nine A.M., the semaphores of the Bahama Canal signaled a thick smoke on the horizon.Two hours later a large steamer exchanged signals with them.The name of the Atlanta flew at once over Tampa Town.At four o’clock the English vessel entered the Bay of Espiritu Santo.At five it crossed the passage of Hillisborough Bay at full steam.At six she cast anchor at Port Tampa.The anchor had scarcely caught the sandy bottom when five hundred boats surrounded the Atlanta, and the steamer was taken by assault.Barbicane was the first to set foot on deck, and in a voice of which he vainly tried to conceal the emotion, called “Michel Ardan.”"
"“这儿呢！”船尾的一个人应道。","“Here!” replied an individual perched on the poop."
"巴比康双臂交叉，目不转睛地看着亚特兰大号上的这位乘客。","Barbicane, with arms crossed, looked fixedly at the passenger of the Atlanta."
"那人大约42岁，个头很高，但是有点驼背。他的大脑袋不时摇动着，甩着一头狮子鬃毛般的红发。他的脸盘不大，额头很宽，胡须像猫胡子一般短而硬，脸颊上满是短短的、淡黄的腮须。一双圆圆的眼睛目光迷离，还有些近视，这使得他的脸更像猫了。他的鼻子很挺，嘴角带着和蔼的微笑，高高的额头，一副聪明相，额上布满了皱纹，像是一块刚犁过的地。他的体格很健壮，还长着两条大长腿。他的手臂肌肉发达，浑身上下散发出一种果敢的气息，看上去是位坚强、乐观的朋友。他的衣服又肥又大，颈巾系得松松垮垮，敞开的领口露出强健的脖子。袖口的扣子从来不系，露出一双红润的手。","He was a man of about forty-two years of age, of large build, but slightly round-shouldered.His massive head momentarily shook a shock of reddish hair, which resembled a lion’s mane.His face was short with a broad forehead, and furnished with a moustache as bristly as a cat’s, and little patches of yellowish whiskers upon full cheeks.Round, wildish eyes, slightly near-sighted, completed a physiognomy essentially feline.His nose was firmly shaped, his mouth particularly sweet in expression, high forehead, intelligent and furrowed with wrinkles like a newly-plowed field.The body was powerfully developed and firmly fixed upon long legs.Muscular arms, and a general air of decision gave him the appearance of a hardy, jolly, companion.He was dressed in a suit of ample dimensions, loose neckerchief, open shirtcollar, disclosing a robust neck; his cuffs were invariably unbuttoned, through which appeared a pair of red hands."
"他在船桥上的人群中来来回回地走着，一刻也不停歇，正如水手们所说，他简直是“拖着锚走路”。他一边紧张贪婪地咬着指甲，一边指手画脚的，对每个人都很放肆。他就是造物者一时心血来潮创造出来的一个怪物，之后造物者又马上把造他的模子毁掉了。","On the bridge of the steamer, in the midst of the crowd, he bustled to and fro, never still for a moment, “dragging his anchors,” as the sailors say, gesticulating, making free with everybody, biting his nails with nervous avidity.He was one of those originals which nature sometimes invents in the freak of a moment, and of which she then breaks the mould."
"这位奇人最突出的怪癖是常常说自己是个十足的无知者，“像莎士比亚一样”。他还公开声称看不起所有的科学家。他口中的“那些家伙”，“只配在我们比赛时帮忙记记分数。”事实上，他是个非常放荡不羁的人，具有冒险精神，但称不上冒险家。他是个轻浮的家伙，一个伊卡罗斯般的人，只不过他有几对可以替换的翅膀。此外，他还随时准备冲锋陷阵、受伤挂彩，不过他每次从高处摔下都能双脚着地，像孩子玩的那种小玩偶一样。总之，他的座右铭是“我有我的主张”，最大的志趣就是为那些不可能的事着迷。","Among other peculiarities, this curiosity gave himself out for a sublime ignoramus, “like Shakespeare,” and professed supreme contempt for all scientific men. Those “fellows,” as he called them, “are only fit to mark the points, while we play the game.” He was, in fact, a thorough Bohemian, adventurous, but not an adventurer; a hare-brained fellow, a kind of Icarus, only possessing relays of wings.For the rest, he was ever in scrapes, ending invariably by falling on his feet, like those little figures which they sell for children’s toys.In a few words, his motto was “I have my opinions,” and the love of the impossible constituted his ruling passion."
"这就是亚特兰大号船上的那位乘客，他总是很激动，好像体内有一团火在燃烧。如果说哪两个人能形成鲜明的对比，那这两个人非米歇尔·阿当和美国人巴比康莫属。这两个人都胆识过人，但表现方式截然不同。","Such was the passenger of the Atlanta, always excitable, as if boiling under the action of some internal fire by the character of his physical organization.If ever two individuals offered a striking contrast to each other, these were certainly Michel Ardan and the Yankee Barbicane; both, moreover, being equally enterprising and daring, each in his own way."
"枪炮俱乐部的主席仔细打量着这位新的竞争对手，但是很快就被人群的呼喊和喝彩声打断了。群众的叫喊声是那样疯狂，他们都想亲自向米歇尔·阿当表达他们的热情，以至于阿当不得不和成千上万的群众握手，最后，他的手指都快被握断了，不得不逃回船舱里。","The scrutiny which the president of the Gun Club had instituted regarding this new rival was quickly interrupted by the shouts and hurrahs of the crowd.The cries became at last so uproarious, and the popular enthusiasm assumed so personal a form, that Michel Ardan, after having shaken hands some thousands of times, at the imminent risk of leaving his fingers behind him, was fain at last to make a bolt for his cabin."
"巴比康跟在他后面，一句话也没说。","Barbicane followed him without uttering a word."
"“我猜，你就是巴比康吧？”米歇尔·阿当说，那口吻好像他和巴比康已是20年的好朋友了。","“You are Barbicane, I suppose?” said Michel Ardan, in a tone of voice in which he would have addressed a friend of twenty years’ standing."
"“是的。”枪炮俱乐部的主席回答。","“Yes,” replied the president of the Gun Club."
"“太好了！你好，巴比康！一切进行得怎么样——很顺利吧？那就好。”","“All right! how d’ye do, Barbicane? how are you getting on— pretty well? that’s right.”"
"“那么，”巴比康开门见山地说，“你决定好要那样做了？”","“So,” said Barbicane without further preliminary, “you are quite determined to go.”"
"“我已经下定决心了。”","“Quite decided.”"
"“什么都阻止不了你？”","“Nothing will stop you?”"
"“什么都阻止不了。你已经根据我的电报内容修改你的炮弹了么？”","“Nothing.Have you modified your projectile according to my telegram.”"
"“我在等你来。但是，”巴比康又问，“你仔细考虑过了么？”","“I waited for your arrival.But,” asked Barbicane again, “have you carefully reflected?”"
"“仔细考虑？难道我还有时间浪费么？我找到一个能去月球旅行的机会，就得好好利用它。这才是重点所在。”","“Reflected? have I any time to spare?I find an opportunity of making a tour in the moon, and I mean to profit by it. There is the whole gist of the matter.”"
"巴比康怔怔地看着这个人，说到去月球旅行，他竟然是那么轻松，毫无焦虑。“但是，”巴比康说，“至少你得有个计划和具体的实施方案吧？”","Barbicane looked hard at this man who spoke so lightly of his project with such complete absence of anxiety.“But, at least,” said he, “you have some plans, some means of carrying your project into execution?”"
"“很好，我亲爱的巴比康，请允许说句话：我希望一次把我的计划讲给所有人听，说完就完了，不必再重复。所以，如果你不反对的话，就把你的朋友、同僚、全城的人、佛罗里达州的全部居民——如果你愿意，也可以是全美国的人——召集起来。明天我将把我的计划说给他们听，回应他们提出的任何异议。你大可放心，我会耐心等待。这样做合你心意吗？”","“Excellent, my dear Barbicane; only permit me to offer one remark: My wish is to tell my story once for all, to everybody, and then have done with it; then there will be no need for recapitulation.So, if you have no objection, assemble your friends, colleagues, the whole town, all Florida, all America if you like, and tomorrow I shall be ready to explain my plans and answer any objections whatever that may be advanced.You may rest assured I shall wait without stirring.Will that suit you?”"
"“当然。”巴比康回答。","“All right,” replied Barbicane."
"说完这话，主席离开船舱，把米歇尔·阿当的提议告诉众人。话音刚落，就响起了热烈的掌声，还有兴奋的欢呼声。所有的问题都解决了。明天，所有人都可以自由自在地欣赏这位欧洲英雄的风采了。不过，一些较为狂热的群众仍然不愿意离开亚特兰大号的甲板。他们在甲板上呆了一整夜。J. T. 马斯顿就是这些人中的一个，他用他的铁钩子勾住船尾的栏杆，看样子只有用起锚机才能把他弄走。","So saying, the president left the cabin and informed the crowd of the proposal of Michel Ardan.His words were received with clappings of hands and shouts of joy.They had removed all difficulties.Tomorrow every one would contemplate at his ease this European hero.However, some of the spectators, more infatuated than the rest, would not leave the deck of the Atlanta.They passed the night on board.Among others J. T. Maston got his hook fixed in the combing of the poop, and it pretty nearly required the capstan to get it out again."
"“他是个英雄！英雄！”他叫着，用各种语句不厌其烦地重复着这一话题，“和这个欧洲人比，我们简直就像脆弱、愚蠢的女人！”","“He is a hero! a hero!” he cried, a theme of which he was never tired of ringing the changes; “and we are only like weak, silly women, compared with this European!”"
"至于主席，他劝告参观者回家之后，又回到那位乘客的舱房里，一直呆到船上的午夜钟声敲响。","As to the president, after having suggested to the visitors it was time to retire, he re-entered the passenger’s cabin, and remained there till the bell of the steamer made it midnight."
"这时，两个竞争对手热情地握了握手，友好地道别了。","But then the two rivals in popularity shook hands heartily and parted on terms of intimate friendship."
"第十九章 大会","CHAPTER XIX A MONSTER MEETING"
"第二天，巴比康担心有人会问米歇尔·阿当一些冒失的问题，便想要减少听众的人数，只让一些最初入会的成员参加，比方说他的同事。但是，这就像堵住尼亚加拉瀑布一样困难。于是，他被迫放弃这个想法，让他的新朋友有机会参与一次公众大会。这次大会的会场选在城后一片平坦宽阔的空地上。多亏港口那些船上的船帆和桅杆，他们只用了几个小时，就在炎热的草地上搭起了一座巨大的帆布帐篷，遮住了灼热的阳光。三十万人不顾窒息的闷热呆了好几个小时，等待这个法国人的到来。在这一大群观众中，前几排既能看得见又能听得着；中间一部分人只能勉强看得见，但什么也听不到；至于后面的人，根本什么都看不见也听不见。三点钟，米歇尔·阿当现身了，陪同他的是枪炮俱乐部的主要会员们。巴比康主席挽着他的右臂，J. T. 马斯顿挽着他的左臂。他容光焕发，面庞红润，比正午的太阳还要光彩照人。阿当登上了演讲台，放眼望去，视野所及之处全是黑色的礼帽。","On the following day Barbicane, fearing that indiscreet questions might be put to Michel Ardan, was desirous of reducing the number of the audience to a few of the initiated, his own colleagues for instance.He might as well have tried to check the Falls of Niagara! he was compelled, therefore, to give up the idea, and let his new friend run the chances of a public conference.The place chosen for this monster meeting was a vast plain situated in the rear of the town.In a few hours, thanks to the help of the shipping in port, an immense roofing of canvas was stretched over the parched prairie, and protected it from the burning rays of the sun.There three hundred thousand people braved for many hours the stifling heat while awaiting the arrival of the Frenchman.Of this crowd of spectators a first set could both see and hear; a second set saw badly and heard nothing at all; and as for the third, it could neither see nor hear anything at all.At three o’clock Michel Ardan made his appearance, accompanied by the principal members of the Gun Club.He was supported on his right by President Barbicane, and on his left by J. T. Maston, more radiant than the midday sun, and nearly as ruddy.Ardan mounted a platform, from the top of which his view extended over a sea of black hats."
"他没有表现出丝毫的不自在，就像在家里一样愉快、亲切、和蔼。他优雅地鞠躬，回应为他喝彩的人们，然后挥着双手示意大家安静，并用十分标准的英语向大家说道：","He exhibited not the slightest embarrassment; he was just as gay, familiar, and pleasant as if he were at home.To the hurrahs which greeted him he replied by a graceful bow; then, waving his hands to request silence, he spoke in perfectly correct English as follows:"
"“先生们，虽然天气炎热、让人烦躁，但我还是请你们耐心地听一会儿我对这项工程的阐述，因为你们似乎对它非常感兴趣。我既不是演说家也不是科学家，我也没想过在公共场合演讲，但是我的朋友巴比康告诉我，你们很想听听我的想法，我非常愿意为你们效劳。那么我就献丑了，在场的三十万观众，如果本人言语中有错误，敬请你们见谅。希望你们不要忘了，站在你们眼前的是一个无知者，他无知到不知道什么叫困难！在他看来，乘坐炮弹飞往月球是一件相当简单、相当自然、轻而易举的事情。这次旅行，人类早晚都会实现。至于采用哪种运输工具，那只能看人类进步到什么程度了。人类最初用四肢爬行；然后从某一天开始，能够两脚步行；后来又坐上了四轮马车、公共马车；现在又有了火车。那么，炮弹就是未来之车，况且行星本身其实并没有那么神秘。先生们，现在你们中的一些人可能会想，我们将赋予炮弹的速度一定非常非常高。这其实不算什么。所有恒星的速度都比这大得多。此时此刻，我们的地球就正以三倍的速度带着我们围绕太阳转动，更何况与其他行星相比，它只不过是在漫步而已！并且，她的速度还在不断地降低。如果这还不足以说明什么，那么下面我想问问大家，是不是在将来的某一天，光或电会成为驱动机器的源动力，产生比这还高得多的速度呢？","“Gentlemen, despite the very hot weather I request your patience for a short time while I offer some explanations regarding the projects which seem to have so interested you.I am neither an orator nor a man of science, and I had no idea of addressing you in public; but my friend Barbicane has told me that you would like to hear me, and I am quite at your service.Listen to me, therefore, with your six hundred thousand ears, and please excuse the faults of the speaker.Now pray do not forget that you see before you a perfect ignoramus whose ignorance goes so far that he cannot even understand the difficulties!It seemed to him that it was a matter quite simple, natural, and easy to take one’s place in a projectile and start for the moon!That journey must be undertaken sooner or later; and, as for the mode of locomotion adopted, it follows simply the law of progress.Man began by walking on all-fours; then, one fine day, on two feet; then in a carriage; then in a stage-coach; and lastly by railway.Well, the projectile is the vehicle of the future, and the planets themselves are nothing else!Now some of you, gentlemen, may imagine that the velocity we propose to impart to it is extravagant.It is nothing of the kind.All the stars exceed it in rapidity, and the earth herself is at this moment carrying us round the sun at three times as rapid a rate, and yet she is a mere lounger on the way compared with many others of the planets!And her velocity is constantly decreasing.Is it not evident, then, I ask you, that there will some day appear velocities far greater than these, of which light or electricity will probably be the mechanical agent?"
"“会的，先生们。”演说家继续说道，“尽管一些目光短浅的家伙认为，人类只能在地球上活动，就像被困在一个永远不许走出的怪圈一样，但总有一天，我们还是会到月亮、行星以及恒星上去旅行，就像现在从利物浦到纽约那样方便、快捷、安全。距离只是一个相对的概念，它最后必将被缩短为零。“","“Yes, gentlemen,” continued the orator, “in spite of the opinions of certain narrow-minded people, who would shut up the human race upon this globe, as within some magic circle which it must never outstep, we shall one day travel to the moon, the planets, and the stars, with the same facility, rapidity, and certainty as we now make the voyage from Liverpool to New York!Distance is but a relative expression, and must end by being reduced to zero.”"
"与会者们虽然倾向于支持这位法国英雄，但对于他大胆的理论还是有些许怀疑。米歇尔·阿当感觉到了大家的怀疑。","The assembly, strongly predisposed as they were in favor of the French hero, were slightly staggered at this bold theory.Michel Ardan perceived the fact."
"“先生们，”他继续带着平和的笑容说，“你们好像不太相信。太好了！我们就一起探个究竟吧。你们知道一列特快火车开到月球需要多久吗？要用三百年，超不过这数字！那是个什么概念呢？这段距离还没有地球一周的九倍长呢。几乎所有的水手和旅行家，即使是不那么活跃的，一生的旅程都会比这长很多。现在想一想，我只要花九十七个小时就能完成我的旅行。啊！我懂了，你们觉得月球离地球很远，所以这项实验必须三思而后行。那你们说，要是到海王星上去呢？它可是在离太阳二十七亿两千多万公里的地方旋转着！再进一步，和恒星相比呢？他们之中有一些像大角星那样，离我们有几十亿公里远。然后，你们再回过头想想太阳和行星之间的这点距离！竟然有人认为距离是个实际存在的东西。太荒谬了，太愚蠢了，简直是胡言乱语！你们知道我是如何理解我们的太阳系的吗？想不想听听我的理论？很简单！","“Gentlemen,” he continued with a pleasant smile, “you do not seem quite convinced.Very good!Let us reason the matter out. Do you know how long it would take for an express train to reach the moon?Three hundred days; no more!And what is that?The distance is no more than nine times the circumference of the earth; and there are no sailors or travelers, of even moderate activity, who have not made longer journeys than that in their lifetime.And now consider that I shall be only ninety- seven hours on my journey.Ah! I see you are reckoning that the moon is a long way off from the earth, and that one must think twice before making the experiment.What would you say, then, if we were talking of going to Neptune, which revolves at a distance of more than two thousand seven hundred and twenty millions of miles from the sun!And yet what is that compared with the distance of the fixed stars, some of which, such as Arcturus, are billions of miles distant from us?And then you talk of the distance which separates the planets from the sun!And there are people who affirm that such a thing as distance exists.Absurdity, folly, idiotic nonsense!Would you know what I think of our own solar universe?Shall I tell you my theory?It is very simple!"
"我认为太阳系是一个均匀的固体，构成它的行星实际上是相互接触的，它们之间的距离和银、铁、铂这类高密度金属的分子之间的空隙是同一个概念。因此，我有权利断言，我再重复一遍，‘距离只是虚名，距离并不真的存在！’我相信你们一定会信服这一点的。”","In my opinion the solar system is a solid homogeneous body; the planets which compose it are in actual contact with each other; and whatever space exists between them is nothing more than the space which separates the molecules of the densest metal, such as silver, iron, or platinum!I have the right, therefore, to affirm, and I repeat, with the conviction which must penetrate all your minds, ‘Distance is but an empty name; distance does not really exist!’”"
"“好哇！”一个声音叫道（有必要说明一下，这是J. T. 马斯顿的声音），“距离并不存在!”由于动作过猛，他差点从看台上掉下去。还好他没掉下去摔得很惨，不然，他就该明白距离可并不是什么虚名了。","“Hurrah!” cried one voice (need it be said it was that of J. T. Maston).“Distance does not exist!” And overcome by the energy of his movements, he nearly fell from the platform to the ground.He just escaped a severe fall, which would have proved to him that distance was by no means an empty name."
"“先生们，”演说家继续说道，“我再重复一遍，地球和她的卫星之间的距离很小，小到不值一提。我坚信20年以后，一半以上的地球人都会拜访月球的。现在，我可敬的朋友们，如果你们有任何问题要问我，即使这些问题会把我这个可怜人难倒，会让我尴尬，我都会尽全力去回答。“","“Gentlemen,” resumed the orator, “I repeat that the distance between the earth and her satellite is a mere trifle, and undeserving of serious consideration.I am convinced that before twenty years are over one-half of our earth will have paid a visit to the moon.Now, my worthy friends, if you have any question to put to me, you will, I fear, sadly embarrass a poor man like myself; still I will do my best to answer you.”"
"目前为止，枪炮俱乐部的主席对讨论的气氛非常满意。然而，从程序上讲，现在该让阿当转向现实的问题中来了，不过显然他对这种问题很不精通。于是巴比康急忙插话，问这位新朋友是否认为月球和行星是可居住的。","Up to this point the president of the Gun Club had been satisfied with the turn which the discussion had assumed.It became now, however, desirable to divert Ardan from questions of a practical nature, with which he was doubtless far less conversant.Barbicane, therefore, hastened to get in a word, and began by asking his new friend whether he thought that the moon and the planets were inhabited."
"“我的主席，这个问题有点大。”演讲家笑着回答。“不过，如果我没弄错的话，一些知识渊博的学者，如普卢塔克，斯威登堡，贝尔纳丹·德圣皮埃尔等，所给予的答案都是肯定的。如果从自然哲学家的视角看这个问题，我可以说，世界上没有无用的东西存在；我还要给你的问题加上一个大胆的问题，如果这些行星是可居住的，那么，它们过去、现在、将来都可能是有人居住的。“","“You put before me a great problem, my worthy president,” replied the orator, smiling.“Still, men of great intelligence, such as Plutarch, Swedenborg, Bernardin de St. Pierre, and others have, if I mistake not, pronounced in the affirmative.Looking at the question from the natural philosopher’s point of view, I should say that nothing useless existed in the world; and, replying to your question by another, I should venture to assert, that if these worlds are habitable, they either are, have been, or will be inhabited.”"
"“再没有谁能将这个问题回答得这么有逻辑、这么合理了。”主席答道，“我们的问题可以归结到：所有天体都适合居住吗？在我看来，是的。”","“No one could answer more logically or fairly,” replied the president.“The question then reverts to this: Are these worlds habitable?For my own part I believe they are.”"
"“我也觉得是。”米歇尔·阿当说。","“For myself, I feel certain of it,” said Michel Ardan."
"“尽管如此，”一位听众反驳道，“还有许多议论反对这些天体的可居性。显然，大部分天体上的生存条件是需要改善的。单说行星吧，由于离太阳的距离有远有近，有的行星能把人热死，有的却能把人冻死。“","“Nevertheless,” retorted one of the audience, “there are many arguments against the habitability of the worlds.The conditions of life must evidently be greatly modified upon the majority of them.To mention only the planets, we should be either broiled alive in some, or frozen to death in others, according as they are more or less removed from the sun.”"
"“我很遗憾，”米歇尔·阿当回答说，“我不知道这个持反对意见的朋友是谁，不然我一定会努力把他说服。我承认，他的反对意见很有价值，但是，我想我们能把这一看法、以及其他怀疑天体可居住性的看法都驳倒。如果我是天生的哲学家，我会告诉他，如果把离太阳最近的行星上的热量转移到离太阳最远的行星上去，这样就会使这些天体达到热量平衡，它们的温度也就适合我们这样的生物居住了。如果我是自然学家，我将告诉他，根据很多杰出科学家的观点，大自然可以为我们提供许多例子，证明地球上的动物其实是在各种迥异的环境下生存的：鱼的呼吸环境对其他动物是致命的；两栖动物拥有很难解释的双重生存方式；有的海洋生物在深海生存，它们要承受相当于50到60个大气压的压力，却不会被压碎；很多对温度不敏感的水生昆虫，既能在沸腾的泉水里生存，也能在极地海洋的冰面上生存。总而言之，我们要知道自然界存在很多生存方式，它们往往不可思议，但却确实存在。","“I regret,” replied Michel Ardan, “that I have not the honor of personally knowing my contradictor, for I would have attempted to answer him.His objection has its merits, I admit; but I think we may successfully combat it, as well as all others which affect the habitability of other worlds.If I were a natural philosopher, I would tell him that if less of caloric were set in motion upon the planets which are nearest to the sun, and more, on the contrary, upon those which are farthest removed from it, this simple fact would alone suffice to equalize the heat, and to render the temperature of those worlds supportable by beings organized like ourselves.If I were a naturalist, I would tell him that, according to some illustrious men of science, nature has furnished us with instances upon the earth of animals existing under very varying conditions of life; that fish respire in a medium fatal to other animals; that amphibious creatures possess a double existence very difficult of explanation; that certain denizens of the seas maintain life at enormous depths, and there support a pressure equal to that of fifty or sixty atmospheres without being crushed; that several aquatic insects, insensible to temperature, are met with equally among boiling springs and in the frozen plains of the Polar Sea; in fine, that we cannot help recognizing in nature a diversity of means of operation oftentimes incomprehensible, but not the less real."
"假如我是化学家，我会告诉他，像石陨石这类的东西，很显然是在地球以外的地方形成的。分析表明，石陨石中毋庸置疑地含有碳元素。从赖兴巴赫的实验中我们得知，这种碳元素一定是来自有机物的。最后，如果我是一名神学家，我会告诉他，圣保罗的救赎思想不只适用于地球，还适用于整个宇宙。但是很不幸，我既不是神学家，也不是化学家，又不是自然学家，更不是哲学家。我对支配宇宙的规律一无所知，因此，我能给出唯一的回答是：‘我不知道其他的天体可居与否，正因为我不知道，所以我想去看看，探个究竟！’”","If I were a chemist, I would tell him that the aerolites, bodies evidently formed exteriorly of our terrestrial globe, have, upon analysis, revealed indisputable traces of carbon, a substance which owes its origin solely to organized beings, and which, according to the experiments of Reichenbach, must necessarily itself have been endued with animation.And lastly, were I a theologian, I would tell him that the scheme of the Divine Redemption, according to St. Paul, seems to be applicable, not merely to the earth, but to all the celestial worlds.But, unfortunately, I am neither theologian, nor chemist, nor naturalist, nor philosopher; therefore, in my absolute ignorance of the great laws which govern the universe, I confine myself to saying in reply, ‘I do not know whether the worlds are inhabited or not: and since I do not know, I am going to see!’”"
"很难说反对米歇尔·阿当的那个人是否还能继续反驳下去，因为人们的呼声太强烈了，根本听不清任何意见。等人们又安静下来之后，这位成功的演说家满意地补充了几句：","Whether Michel Ardan’s antagonist hazarded any further arguments or not it is impossible to say, for the uproarious shouts of the crowd would not allow any expression of opinion to gain a hearing.On silence being restored, the triumphant orator contented himself with adding the following remarks:"
"“先生们，你们会发现，关于这个伟大的话题我其实谈得很浅。还有一种论调，从完全不同的角度支持行星的可居性，我在这里暂且不提了。我只想让大家注意一点。对于那些坚持认为其他行星不能居住的人们，我们应该这样回应它们：就算伏尔泰也站在你们那一边，你们也得拿出证据，证明地球是宇宙中最好的可居住地，这样，你们才算是正确的。地球只有一个卫星，而木星、天王星、土星、海王星，每一个都有好几个卫星，这是我们一个不容忽视的优势。但是，由于地轴和地球运转轨道平面之间存在着夹角，我们过得很不舒服。这个夹角导致了昼夜时间的不等长，也产生了让人不快的季节差异。住在这个糟糕的球体上，我们不是太热就是太冷，冬天冷得要死，夏天热得要命。这里到处是风湿、咳嗽、支气管炎等疾病。而像木星这种星球，由于夹角很小，上面的居民可以生活在相对均衡的气温下。那里会有固定的春季、夏季、秋季、冬季的区域，每一个木星人可以自由选择他喜欢的季节所在的区域，这样他一生都可以避免气温的变换。我相信，你们会很乐意承认木星的居住环境是优于我们的地球的，更不用说木星上的一年相当于我们的十二年！木星那么适宜居住，生存条件那么优越，生活在那个世界的居民是多么幸运啊！我想他们也一定在各方面都优于我们。我们的地球要达到这种完美，需要的只是把夹角弄小一点！”","“Gentlemen, you will observe that I have but slightly touched upon this great question.There is another altogether different line of argument in favor of the habitability of the stars, which I omit for the present.I only desire to call attention to one point.To those who maintain that the planets are not inhabited one may reply: You might be perfectly in the right, if you could only show that the earth is the best possible world, in spite of what Voltaire has said.She has but one satellite, while Jupiter, Uranus, Saturn, Neptune have each several, an advantage by no means to be despised.But that which renders our own globe so uncomfortable is the inclination of its axis to the plane of its orbit.Hence the inequality of days and nights; hence the disagreeable diversity of the seasons.On the surface of our unhappy spheroid we are always either too hot or too cold; we are frozen in winter, broiled in summer; it is the planet of rheumatism, coughs, bronchitis; while on the surface of Jupiter, for example, where the axis is but slightly inclined, the inhabitants may enjoy uniform temperatures.It possesses zones of perpetual springs, summers, autumns, and winters; every Jovian may choose for himself what climate he likes, and there spend the whole of his life in security from all variations of temperature.You will, I am sure, readily admit this superiority of Jupiter over our own planet, to say nothing of his years, which each equal twelve of ours!Under such auspices and such marvelous conditions of existence, it appears to me that the inhabitants of so fortunate a world must be in every respect superior to ourselves.All we require, in order to attain such perfection, is the mere trifle of having an axis of rotation less inclined to the plane of its orbit!”"
"“好哇！”传来一声激情四溢的叫喊，“我们团结起来，发明一些机器来扭转地轴！”","“Hurrah!” roared an energetic voice, “let us unite our efforts, invent the necessary machines, and rectify the earth’s axis!”"
"一阵雷鸣般的掌声随之而起，原来，说这话的不是别人，正是J. T. 马斯顿。然而，说实话，如果美国人能找到阿基米德的那个支点，那他们很可能早就造出一根能撬起地球、改变地轴的杠杆了。然而，阻碍这些大胆机械家们的，正是他们找不到这个支点。","A thunder of applause followed this proposal, the author of which was, of course, no other than J. T. Maston.And, in all probability, if the truth must be told, if the Yankees could only have found a point of application for it, they would have constructed a lever capable of raising the earth and rectifying its axis.It was just this deficiency which baffled these daring mechanicians."
"第二十章 攻与守","CHAPTER XX ATTACK AND RIPOSTE"
"会场上兴奋的气氛刚刚平息，便传来了一个坚定有力的声音：","As soon as the excitement had subsided, the following words were heard uttered in a strong and determined voice:"
"“既然您已经我们讲了这么多富有想象力的想法，现在能不能回到主题，讨论一些更实际的问题呢？”","“Now that the speaker has favored us with so much imagination, would he be so good as to return to his subject, and give us a little practical view of the question?”"
"所有目光都投向了这个说话的人。他长得瘦小枯干，但是精神十足，留着美国式的山羊胡须。他是趁着人群的几次骚动，从混乱中一点点挤到前排的。他两臂交叉在胸前，虎视眈眈地盯着会场上那位大英雄。提完问题后，他就没再说话，似乎毫不在意周围投来的成千上万道目光，以及非难的窃窃私语。开始，他的对手没有答话，于是他又重复了一遍问题，还重重地补上一句：“我们在这里要谈的是月球而不是地球。”","All eyes were directed toward the person who spoke.He was a little dried-up man, of an active figure, with an American “goatee” beard.Profiting by the different movements in the crowd, he had managed by degrees to gain the front row of spectators.There, with arms crossed and stern gaze, he watched the hero of the meeting.After having put his question he remained silent, and appeared to take no notice of the thousands of looks directed toward himself, nor of the murmur of disapprobation excited by his words.Meeting at first with no reply, he repeated his question with marked emphasis, adding, “We are here to talk about the moon and not about the earth.”"
"“先生，您说得对，”米歇尔·阿当回答说，“我们是有点跑题了。我们继续来谈谈月球吧。”","“You are right, sir,” replied Michel Ardan; “the discussion has become irregular.We will return to the moon.”"
"“先生，”这个陌生人说，“您以为我们的卫星是可以居住的。很好，但是，如果月球人真的存在，那他们一定是在不呼吸的情况下生存的——为你着想，我要提醒你一下——月球表面可是一个空气分子都没有啊。“","“Sir,” said the unknown, “you pretend that our satellite is inhabited.Very good, but if Selenites do exist, that race of beings assuredly must live without breathing, for—I warn you for your own sake—there is not the smallest particle of air on the surface of the moon.”"
"听到这里，阿当红色的头发都竖起来了，他意识到要和这个人在最关键的问题上争个你死我活了。他也虎视眈眈地望着对方，回敬道：","At this remark, Ardan pushed up his shock of red hair; he saw that he was on the point of being involved in a struggle with this person upon the very gist of the whole question. He looked sternly at him in his turn and said:"
"“哦？月球上没有空气吗？麻烦您告诉我，这话是谁说的啊？”","“Oh! so there is no air in the moon?And pray, if you are so good, who ventures to affirm that?”"
"“科学家们说的。”","“The men of science.”"
"“真的吗？”","“Really?”"
"“真的。”","“Really.”"
"“先生，”米歇尔回答说，“说真的，我对真正懂科学的那些科学家是十分尊重的，但对那些不懂装懂的科学家，我也是十分鄙视的。”","“Sir,” replied Michel, “pleasantry apart, I have a profound respect for men of science who do possess science, but a profound contempt for men of science who do not.”"
"“你见过不懂装懂的科学家？”","“Do you know any who belong to the latter category?”"
"“当然。在法国，有些人偏偏认为鸟儿严格意义上是不能飞的。于是，其他人就凭这个理论，证明鱼其实不是天生生活在水里的。“","“Decidedly.In France there are some who maintain that, mathematically, a bird cannot possibly fly; and others who demonstrate theoretically that fishes were never made to live in water.”"
"“我认识的科学家不是这类人。我可以引用一些人的话来证明我的观点，这些人的名字对你肯定很有说服力。”","“I have nothing to do with persons of that description, and I can quote, in support of my statement, names which you cannot refuse deference to.”"
"“那么，先生，你一定会把我这个可怜的无知者难倒的，不过我总是喜欢长长见识。”","“Then, sir, you will sadly embarrass a poor ignorant, who, besides, asks nothing better than to learn.”"
"“那么，为什么你连研究都不研究，就把这些科学问题拿出来谈论呢？”这个陌生人有点粗鲁地问道。","“Why, then, do you introduce scientific questions if you have never studied them?” asked the unknown somewhat coarsely."
"“因为‘无知者无畏’。我很无知，这是事实，但是正是这个弱点给了我力量。”","“For the reason that ‘he is always brave who never suspects danger.’ I know nothing, it is true; but it is precisely my very weakness which constitutes my strength.”"
"“你无知得都快达到愚昧的地步了吧。”陌生人怒气冲天地驳斥道。","“Your weakness amounts to folly,” retorted the unknown in a passion."
"“很好，”这位法国人回答，“要是这种愚昧能把我带到月球上去，那就更好了。”","“All the better,” replied our Frenchman, “if it carries me up to the moon.”"
"巴比康和他的同僚们恶狠狠地盯着这个公然反对他们事业的家伙，恨不得把他吞掉。没人认识这个家伙。主席觉得很不安，担心地望着他的新朋友米歇尔，不知道这场太过自由的讨论将会导致什么结果。与会的听众开始有些躁动，因为反对者把他们的注意力都引到了危险上，几乎让他们觉得刚才那令人兴奋的提议是无法实现的。","Barbicane and his colleagues devoured with their eyes the intruder who had so boldly placed himself in antagonism to their enterprise.Nobody knew him, and the president, uneasy as to the result of so free a discussion, watched his new friend with some anxiety.The meeting began to be somewhat fidgety also, for the contest directed their attention to the dangers, if not the actual impossibilities, of the proposed expedition."
"“先生，”阿当的对手说，“有很多不容置疑的理由可以证明月球的确是没有空气的。我可以说，假设那里曾经有过空气，也肯定早被地球吸光了。但是，我还是想用不可否认的事实来说话。”","“Sir,” replied Ardan’s antagonist, “there are many and incontrovertible reasons which prove the absence of an atmosphere in the moon.I might say that, a priori, if one ever did exist, it must have been absorbed by the earth; but I prefer to bring forward indisputable facts.”"
"“您请吧，先生，尽管说。”","“Bring them forward then, sir, as many as you please.”"
"“您知道，”陌生人说，“当任何光线穿过像空气这样的介质时，都会改变方向、偏离直线，也就是发生折射。哦！当星星被月亮遮住时，它们发出的光经过月盘边缘，并没有偏折，也就是说没有一丝一毫折射的迹象。因此，这就说明了月球周围并没有大气层存在。”","“You know,” said the stranger, “that when any luminous rays cross a medium such as the air, they are deflected out of the straight line; in other words, they undergo refraction.Well! When stars are occulted by the moon, their rays, on grazing the edge of her disc, exhibit not the least deviation, nor offer the slightest indication of refraction.It follows, therefore, that the moon cannot be surrounded by an atmosphere.”"
"“实际上，”阿当答道，“如果这不是你唯一的论据，至少也是你的主要论据，一个真正的科学家面对你的质疑都可能感到迷惑。至于我，我会很简单地回答你，你的论据是有缺陷的，因为它假设了月球的角直径是确定的，而事实上并非如此。不过咱们接着往下说吧。亲爱的朋友，告诉我，你承认月球表面有火山吗？”","“In point of fact,” replied Ardan, “this is your chief, if not your only argument; and a really scientific man might be puzzled to answer it.For myself, I will simply say that it is defective, because it assumes that the angular diameter of the moon has been completely determined, which is not the case.But let us proceed.Tell me, my dear sir, do you admit the existence of volcanoes on the moon’s surface?”"
"“死火山，有！活火山，没有！”","“Extinct, yes! In activity, no!”"
"“但这些火山曾经是很活跃的吧？”","“These volcanoes, however, were at one time in a state of activity?”"
"“当然。但是，即使火山周围存在燃烧所需要的氧，仅凭火山爆发也不能证明大气层的存在啊。”","“True, but, as they furnish themselves the oxygen necessary for combustion, the mere fact of their eruption does not prove the presence of an atmosphere.”"
"“那么，我们再往下说，把这个问题先放在一边，我们来谈谈直接观测吧。1715年，天文学家卢维尔和哈雷在观测五月三日的月蚀时，发现一种十分奇怪的光在月球上不时地闪现。他们认为，这些忽闪忽现、快速闪动的光是月球大气层里的暴风雨造成的。”","“Proceed again, then; and let us set aside this class of arguments in order to come to direct observations.In 1715 the astronomers Louville and Halley, watching the eclipse of the 3rd of May, remarked some very extraordinary scintillations.These jets of light, rapid in nature, and of frequent recurrence, they attributed to thunderstorms generated in the lunar atmosphere.”"
"“1715年，”陌生人反驳道，“天文学家卢维尔和哈雷观测到的所谓月球上的现象其实只是地球上的，比如地球大气层中陨落的流星或其他物质。当时的科学家就是这样解释的，而我也这么认为。”","“In 1715,” replied the unknown, “the astronomers Louville and Halley mistook for lunar phenomena some which were purely terrestrial, such as meteoric or other bodies which are generated in our own atmosphere.This was the scientific explanation at the time of the facts; and that is my answer now.”"
"“那好吧，”阿当说，“可是赫歇耳不是在1787年观测到月球表面有许多发光点吗？”","“On again, then,” replied Ardan; “Herschel, in 1787, observed a great number of luminous points on the moon’s surface, did he not?”"
"“是有这么一回事！但他并没有对它们做出任何解释。赫歇耳本人从来没有说过这是因为月球上有大气层的缘故。我还想补充一下，有两位研究月球的权威专家比尔和马德累尔，他们也肯定地认为月球表面没有空气存在。”","“Yes! but without offering any solution of them.Herschel himself never inferred from them the necessity of a lunar atmosphere.And I may add that Baeer and Maedler, the two great authorities upon the moon, are quite agreed as to the entire absence of air on its surface.”"
"会场上又是一片骚动。人们似乎越来越对这个陌生人的说法感到兴奋了。","A movement was here manifest among the assemblage, who appeared to be growing excited by the arguments of this singular personage."
"“暂且先不谈这个了，”阿当非常冷静地回答，“我们接下来谈谈重点吧。1806年7月18日，才华横溢的法国天文学家洛瑟达在观测月蚀时发现，新月的尖角变圆了，像是被切掉了一截。这样看来，这个现象只能是太阳光在穿过月球大气层时发生偏折而产生的。没有其他可能的解释了。”","“Let us proceed,” replied Ardan, with perfect coolness, “and come to one important fact.A skillful French astronomer, M. Laussedat, in watching the eclipse of July 18, 1860, probed that the horns of the lunar crescent were rounded and truncated.Now, this appearance could only have been produced by a deviation of the solar rays in traversing the atmosphere of the moon.There is no other possible explanation of the facts.”"
"“可是，这例子属实吗？”","“But is this established as a fact?”"
"“绝对属实！”","“Absolutely certain!”"
"会场上又出现了一阵骚乱，不过这一次大家都站到了他们爱戴的英雄这边来，而他的对手却开始沉默了。阿当又开口了，但并没有因为占上风而表现出任何的沾沾自喜。他只是说：","A counter-movement here took place in favor of the hero of the meeting, whose opponent was now reduced to silence.Ardan resumed the conversation; and without exhibiting any exultation at the advantage he had gained, simply said:"
"“您瞧，我亲爱的朋友。我们不能绝对肯定月球上没有空气存在。那里的大气层也许非常稀薄，然而今天的科学界已经普遍承认了它的存在。”","“You see, then, my dear sir, we must not pronounce with absolute positiveness against the existence of an atmosphere in the moon.That atmosphere is, probably, of extreme rarity; nevertheless at the present day science generally admits that it exists.”"
"“不管怎么说，山上是一定没有大气存在的。”这个陌生人丝毫不想让步。","“Not in the mountains, at all events,” returned the unknown, unwilling to give in."
"“山上是没有！但谷底有，只是超不过几百英尺厚。”","“No! but at the bottom of the valleys, and not exceeding a few hundred feet in height.”"
"“无论如何，你最好做好一切预防措施，因为那里空气非常稀薄，稀薄得可怕。”","“In any case you will do well to take every precaution, for the air will be terribly rarified.”"
"“善良正直的先生，那里的空气足够我一个人用了，而且，一旦到了那里，我还会尽我所能节约那里的空气，等到真的挺不住了再呼吸！”","“My good sir, there will always be enough for a solitary individual; besides, once arrived up there, I shall do my best to economize, and not to breathe except on grand occasions!”"
"排山倒海的大笑在这位神秘的反对者耳边响起，他怒气冲冲地望着周围的人。","A tremendous roar of laughter rang in the ears of the mysterious interlocutor, who glared fiercely round upon the assembly."
"“那么，”阿当漫不经心地继续说，“既然我们一致认为月球上是有一定空气的，我们是不是也得承认那上面有一定的水呢。我个人对这个结论是非常满意的。另外，我可敬的反对者，请允许我再提出一点意见。我们只了解月球的一个面，如果这一面的空气很稀薄的话，那么背对着我们的那一面空气可能会充足。”","“Then,” continued Ardan, with a careless air, “since we are in accord regarding the presence of a certain atmosphere, we are forced to admit the presence of a certain quantity of water.This is a happy consequence for me.Moreover, my amiable contradictor, permit me to submit to you one further observation.We only know one side of the moon’s disc; and if there is but little air on the face presented to us, it is possible that there is plenty on the one turned away from us.”"
"“那是为什么呢？”","“And for what reason?”"
"“月球受地球的引力作用，形状就像一个鸡蛋，我们看到的是较小的那一头。而且，根据奥桑的计算结果，月球的重心在另一半球上。因此，我们可以得出结论，在我们卫星形成的初期，大部分的空气和水都被重力吸引到我们看不见的另一面去了。”","“Because the moon, under the action of the earth’s attraction, has assumed the form of an egg, which we look at from the smaller end. Hence it follows, by Hausen’s calculations, that its center of gravity is situated in the other hemisphere.Hence it results that the great mass of air and water must have been drawn away to the other face of our satellite during the first days of its creation.”"
"“纯粹是异想天开！”陌生人大声喊道。","“Pure fancies!” cried the unknown."
"“不！这是纯粹的理论，是建立在力学定律基础上的理论，我认为它们是很难被驳倒的！那么，我要问问所有与会者，你们说像我们这样生存在地球上的生物能不能在月球上存活？”","“No! Pure theories! which are based upon the laws of mechanics, and it seems difficult to me to refute them.I appeal then to this meeting, and I put it to them whether life, such as exists upon the earth, is possible on the surface of the moon?”"
"30万听众同时鼓掌表示肯定。阿当的对手还想反驳，但是，别人根本听不见他说什么。他被冰雹般猛烈的叫喊和威胁包围了。","Three hundred thousand auditors at once applauded the proposition.Ardan’s opponent tried to get in another word, but he could not obtain a hearing.Cries and menaces fell upon him like hail."
"“够了！够了！”有人喊道。","“Enough! enough!” cried some."
"“把这个捣乱的家伙赶出去！”其他人喊着。","“Drive the intruder off!” shouted others."
"“把他轰走！”愤怒的群众呼喊道。","“Turn him out!” roared the exasperated crowd."
"但是，这位反对者一步也不肯退让，一动不动地站在看台上等待着暴风雨的平息。要不是米歇尔·阿当做了一个手势示意大家安静，这场暴风雨很快会发展到十分骇人的地步。阿当是一个很讲义气的人，不会在紧要关头丢下对手不管的。","But he, holding firmly on to the platform, did not budge an inch, and let the storm pass on, which would soon have assumed formidable proportions, if Michel Ardan had not quieted it by a gesture.He was too chivalrous to abandon his opponent in an apparent extremity."
"“您还要说几句吗？”他很有礼貌地问。","“You wished to say a few more words?” he asked, in a pleasant voice."
"“是的，我有很多话要说，不过不了，我只说一句！如果你执意要实行你的计划，我只能说你是个——","“Yes, a thousand; or rather, no, only one!If you persevere in your enterprise, you must be a——”"
"“非常鲁莽的人！您怎么能这样看我呢？要知道，我已经叫他们为我制造一发圆锥体的炮弹，那样我就不会像松鼠似的一路打滚儿啦！”","“Very rash person!How can you treat me as such? me, who have demanded a cylindro-conical projectile, in order to prevent turning round and round on my way like a squirrel?”"
"“可是，可怜的兄弟，没准儿你还没坐稳，那可怕的后坐力就把你压成馅饼了。”","“But, unhappy man, the dreadful recoil will smash you to pieces at your starting.”"
"“我亲爱的反对者，您刚才提及的正是我们面临的困难，唯一的困难。但我绝对相信美国人民的勤劳和智慧，他们一定会克服这个困难的。”","“My dear contradictor, you have just put your finger upon the true and only difficulty; nevertheless, I have too good an opinion of the industrial genius of the Americans not to believe that they will succeed in overcoming it.”"
"“可是炮弹快速穿过大气层时所产生的热量你考虑过吗？”","“But the heat developed by the rapidity of the projectile in crossing the strata of air?”"
"“噢！炮弹的外壳是很厚的，而且我很快就能穿过大气层。”","“Oh! the walls are thick, and I shall soon have crossed the atmosphere.”"
"“可食物和水的问题怎么解决呢？”","“But victuals and water?”"
"“我已经算过了，我能带一年的食物上去，而旅行只有四天。”","“I have calculated for a twelvemonth’s supply, and I shall be only four days on the journey.”"
"“可是一路上用来呼吸的氧气怎么办？”","“But for air to breathe on the road?”"
"“我可以用化学方法制造氧气啊。”","“I shall make it by a chemical process.”"
"“可是，就算你能到达月球，你该怎样降落呢？”","“But your fall on the moon, supposing you ever reach it?”"
"“在月球上降落的危险系数是在地球上降落的六分之一，因为物体在月球上的重量只有在地球上的六分之一。”","“It will be six times less dangerous than a sudden fall upon the earth, because the weight will be only one-sixth as great on the surface of the moon.”"
"“那也会让你摔得粉身碎骨啊！”","“Still it will be enough to smash you like glass!”"
"“我会在适当的时候点燃放置在合适位置的火箭，一定能减小我受到的反冲力！”","“What is to prevent my retarding the shock by means of rockets conveniently placed, and lighted at the right moment?”"
"“好吧，就算所有的困难都克服了，所有的障碍都清除了，所有的好运气都落在你一个人身上，你能安全地抵达月球，可是你怎么回来呢？”","“But after all, supposing all difficulties surmounted, all obstacles removed, supposing everything combined to favor you, and granting that you may arrive safe and sound in the moon, how will you come back?”"
"“我不回来了！”","“I am not coming back!”"
"这是一句质朴的豪言壮语，话音落后，全场鸦雀无声。但是，这种安静比那些热情的呼喊更有说服力。陌生人趁机再次反驳道：","At this reply, almost sublime in its very simplicity, the assembly became silent.But its silence was more eloquent than could have been its cries of enthusiasm.The unknown profited by the opportunity and once more protested:"
"“你这样做一定会没命的！”他叫喊着，“你的死只是一个疯子的举动，对科学毫无意义！”","“You will inevitably kill yourself!” he cried; “and your death will be that of a madman, useless even to science!”"
"“请继续说下去，我亲爱的陌生人，因为您的预言真的十分讨人喜欢！”","“Go on, my dear unknown, for truly your prophecies are most agreeable!”"
"“我真是受够了！”米歇尔·阿当的敌人叫道，“我真搞不懂自己为什么要和你争论不休！去享受你那疯狂的远征吧！这样我们就不用再为你头疼了！”","“It really is too much!” cried Michel Ardan’s adversary.“I do not know why I should continue so frivolous a discussion!Please yourself about this insane expedition!We need not trouble ourselves about you!”"
"“祈祷并不拘泥于虚礼！”","“Pray don’t stand upon ceremony!”"
"“不！还有一个人应该对你的行为负责。”　","“No! another person is responsible for your act.”"
"“谁啊，我能问问吗？”米歇尔·阿当傲慢地回敬道。","“Who, may I ask?” demanded Michel Ardan in an imperious tone."
"“那个发起这个荒谬实验的白痴！”","“The ignoramus who organized this equally absurd and impossible experiment!”"
"这个攻击很直接。自从这个陌生人开始搅场子，巴比康就一直在努力地克制自己，可现在矛头直接指向他了，他就再也忍不住了。他一下子站起身，要冲向那个挑战他的敌人，但是，他突然发觉自己离那个人很远。","The attack was direct.Barbicane, ever since the interference of the unknown, had been making fearful efforts of self-control; now, however, seeing himself directly attacked, he could restrain himself no longer.He rose suddenly, and was rushing upon the enemy who thus braved him to the face, when all at once he found himself separated from him."
"原来50个壮汉把讲台抬了起来，用这种方式向大获全胜的枪炮俱乐部的主席和米歇尔·阿当表示敬意。这个大架子非常重，但还是不断有人前来替班，争着、抢着，甚至是撕打着，要用自己的肩膀抬着英雄游行。","The platform was lifted by a hundred strong arms, and the president of the Gun Club shared with Michel Ardan triumphal honors.The shield was heavy, but the bearers came in continuous relays, disputing, struggling, even fighting among themselves in their eagerness to lend their shoulders to this demonstration."
"然而，那位陌生人并没有趁着混乱逃跑。况且处在水泄不通的人群中间，他也出不去。他仍坚守在前排，双臂交叉，怒视着巴比康主席。","However, the unknown had not profited by the tumult to quit his post.Besides he could not have done it in the midst of that compact crowd.There he held on in the front row with crossed arms, glaring at President Barbicane."
"胜利的游行达到了高潮，人潮中的呼声一浪高过一浪。米歇尔·阿当显然是高兴地享受着这一刻。他脸上闪耀着喜悦。讲台中途上下颠簸了好几次，就像大海上遇到风浪的船只。但是，此次集会的两位大英雄却有着坚固的支撑。他们一次都没有摔倒，脚下的航船顺利地进入了坦帕城。","The shouts of the immense crowd continued at their highest pitch throughout this triumphant march.Michel Ardan took it all with evident pleasure.His face gleamed with delight.Several times the platform seemed seized with pitching and rolling like a weatherbeaten ship.But the two heros of the meeting had good sea-legs.They never stumbled; and their vessel arrived without dues at the port of Tampa Town."
"米歇尔·阿当幸运地躲过了最后一拨狂热崇拜者的簇拥。　他走进富兰克林酒店，迅速回到房间，换上了睡衣。而他的窗下，还有成千上万的人在围观。","Michel Ardan managed fortunately to escape from the last embraces of his vigorous admirers.He made for the Hotel Franklin, quickly gained his chamber, and slid under the bedclothes, while an army of a hundred thousand men kept watch under his windows."
"此时此刻，短暂、严肃而又果决的一幕正在那位神秘人物和枪炮俱乐部主席之间上演。","During this time a scene, short, grave, and decisive, took place between the mysterious personage and the president of the Gun Club."
"原来，巴比康刚从游行中脱身，就直接走向他的敌人。","Barbicane, free at last, had gone straight at his adversary."
"“跟我来！”他气冲冲地说。","“Come!” he said shortly."
"对方跟着他在码头上走着，不一会儿，他们就走到了琼斯瀑布脚下一个露天码头的入口处。","The other followed him on the quay; and the two presently found themselves alone at the entrance of an open wharf on Jones’ Fall."
"这对互不相识的敌人都瞪着对方。","The two enemies, still mutually unknown, gazed at each other."
"“你是谁？”巴比康问。","“Who are you?” asked Barbicane."
"“尼科尔上校！”","“Captain Nicholl!”"
"“让我猜中了。迄今为止，老天还从没让我碰到你。”","“So I suspected.Hitherto chance has never thrown you in my way.”"
"“所以我自己送上门来了。”","“I am come for that purpose.”"
"“你侮辱了我。”","“You have insulted me.”"
"“而且是当众侮辱！”","“Publicly!”"
"“你是不是得就这次侮辱给我一个交代呢？”","“And you will answer to me for this insult?”"
"“现在就给。”","“At this very moment.”"
"“不！我希望我们之间所有的恩怨能够私下解决。坦帕城外三英里处有一座小树林，叫斯克斯诺。你知道吧？”","“No!I desire that all that passes between us shall be secret.Their is a wood situated three miles from Tampa, the wood of Skersnaw.Do you know it?”"
"“我知道。”","“I know it.”"
"“你愿不愿意明天早上五点从树林的一边走进去？”","“Will you be so good as to enter it to-morrow morning at five o’clock, on one side?”"
"“好！只要你在同一时间从另一边走进来。”","“Yes! if you will enter at the other side at the same hour.”"
"“别忘了带上你的步枪！”巴比康说。","“And you will not forget your rifle?” said Barbicane."
"“还是提醒你自己吧！”尼科尔回答。","“No more than you will forget yours?” replied Nicholl."
"俱乐部主席和上校冷冷地说了这几句话，就分开了。巴比康回到了自己的住所，但他没有马上休息，而是一晚上都在琢磨怎么抵消炮弹的后坐力，以解决米歇尔·阿当在大会讨论中提到的难题。","These words having been coldly spoken, the president of the Gun Club and the captain parted.Barbicane returned to his lodging; but instead of snatching a few hours of repose, he passed the night in endeavoring to discover a means of evading the recoil of the projectile, and resolving the difficult problem proposed by Michel Ardan during the discussion at the meeting."
"第二十一章 法国人巧化仇恨","CHAPTER XXI HOW A FRENCHMAN MANAGES AN AFFAIR"
"主席和上校所提到的决斗是一种可怕而野蛮的对决，敌对双方都想置对方于死地。就在这两个人商量决斗之时，米歇尔·阿当正在休息，慢慢地驱赶由兴奋带来的疲惫。不过休息这个词放在这里不太恰当，因为美国的床硬得快赶上大理石或花岗岩桌面了。","While the contract of this duel was being discussed by the president and the captain—this dreadful, savage duel, in which each adversary became a man-hunter—Michel Ardan was resting from the fatigues of his triumph.Resting is hardly an appropriate expression, for American beds rival marble or granite tables for hardness."
"阿当睡得极不踏实，裹在被单里翻来覆去，还梦见他在炮弹里安置了一套比这张床舒适得多的沙发。突然，一阵恼人的嘈杂声把他吵醒。房门随着震耳欲聋的噪声一颤一颤。声音好像是什么铁器弄出来的。噪声中还夹杂着大喊大叫，时辰也未免太早了点。“开门啊，”有人扯着嗓子喊着，“我的老天！”阿当本来是有充分理由不去理会如此粗鲁的要求的。不过，他还是赶在这位固执的来访者把门敲坏之前，及时爬起来打开了门。枪炮俱乐部的秘书冲进房间。他弄出了巨大的动静，极其无礼地进了屋，简直就像一颗横冲直撞的炮弹。","Ardan was sleeping, then, badly enough, tossing about between the cloths which served him for sheets, and he was dreaming of making a more comfortable couch in his projectile when a frightful noise disturbed his dreams.Thundering blows shook his door.They seemed to be caused by some iron instrument.A great deal of loud talking was distinguishable in this racket, which was rather too early in the morning.“Open the door,” some one shrieked, “for heaven’s sake!” Ardan saw no reason for complying with a demand so roughly expressed.However, he got up and opened the door just as it was giving way before the blows of this determined visitor.The secretary of the Gun Club burst into the room.A bomb could not have made more noise or have entered the room with less ceremony."
"“昨晚，”马斯顿猝然叫道，“有人在会上公开侮辱我们的主席。向他挑衅的人不是别人，正是尼科尔上校！他们今天早上会在斯克斯诺树林里决斗。这是巴比康主席亲口告诉我的。如果他决斗而死，我们的计划就会变成泡影。我们必须阻止这场决斗，于是我想到了您，米歇尔·阿当先生，只有您才能劝得住他啊。”","“Last night,” cried J. T. Maston, ex abrupto, “our president was publicly insulted during the meeting.He provoked his adversary, who is none other than Captain Nicholl!They are fighting this morning in the wood of Skersnaw.I heard all the particulars from the mouth of Barbicane himself.If he is killed, then our scheme is at an end. We must prevent his duel; and one man alone has enough influence over Barbicane to stop him, and that man is Michel Ardan.”"
"米歇尔·阿当一边听J.T.马斯顿一口气说完这番话，一边急忙穿上衣服。不到两分钟，这两位朋友就快步奔向坦帕城郊外。","While J. T. Maston was speaking, Michel Ardan, without interrupting him, had hastily put on his clothes; and, in less than two minutes, the two friends were making for the suburbs of Tampa Town with rapid strides."
"马斯顿一边走一边把整个事情的来龙去脉都告诉了阿当。他告诉阿当巴比康和尼科尔敌对的真正原因，还有他们的仇恨是多么日久年深，还有，多亏一些朋友暗地里帮忙，这两位宿敌才从未谋面。他又补充说，他们的仇恨其实是从钢板和子弹的小矛盾慢慢地发展到今天的地步的。这次大会上的那一幕，对于尼科尔来说正是一次等待已久的清算宿怨的机会。","It was during this walk that Maston told Ardan the state of the case.He told him the real causes of the hostility between Barbicane and Nicholl; how it was of old date, and why, thanks to unknown friends, the president and the captain had, as yet, never met face to face.He added that it arose simply from a rivalry between iron plates and shot, and, finally, that the scene at the meeting was only the long-wished-for opportunity for Nicholl to pay off an old grudge."
"没有什么比美国的这种私下决斗更可怕了。敌对双方像野兽一样互相攻击。他们在决斗时，一定很期望自己能像草原上的印第安人一样，拥有那些高超的本领——敏锐的反应、天生的智谋，还有对敌人的洞察力。一点疏忽，片刻犹豫，或是走错一小步，就有可能丢了性命。通常，美国人会带着他们的狗，一连几个小时地厮打。","Nothing is more dreadful than private duels in America.The two adversaries attack each other like wild beasts.Then it is that they might well covet those wonderful properties of the Indians of the prairies—their quick intelligence, their ingenious cunning, their scent of the enemy.A single mistake, a moment’s hesitation, a single false step may cause death.On these occasions Yankees are often accompanied by their dogs, and keep up the struggle for hours."
"阿当听他的伙伴绘声绘色地描述了决斗场景后，喊道：“你们简直是魔鬼！”","“What demons you are!” cried Michel Ardan, when his companion had depicted this scene to him with much energy."
"“是啊，您说的是，”J.T.谦虚地说，“不过我们得再快点。”","“Yes, we are,” replied J. T. modestly; “but we had better make haste.”"
"他和米歇尔·阿当穿过了晨露未干的草地，又抄近道穿过小溪和稻田，但还是没能在五点半之前赶到斯科斯诺。","Though Michel Ardan and he had crossed the plains still wet with dew, and had taken the shortest route over creeks and ricefields, they could not reach Skersnaw in under five hours and a half."
"巴比康肯定半小时前就进去了。","Barbicane must have passed the border half an hour ago."
"那里有位老樵夫，正在用斧子把刚刚砍倒的树劈成柴。","There was an old bushman working there, occupied in selling fagots from trees that had been leveled by his axe."
"马斯顿跑向他，问道：“您看到有一个人带着一把步枪往树林里面走了吗？就是巴比康主席，我最好的朋友。”","Maston ran toward him, saying, “Have you seen a man go into the wood, armed with a rifle?Barbicane, the president, my best friend?”"
"这位称职的枪炮俱乐部秘书以为世界上所有人都认识他的主席呢。但是樵夫好像没弄明白他说的是谁。","The worthy secretary of the Gun Club thought that his president must be known by all the world.But the bushman did not seem to understand him."
" “一个猎人？”阿当说。","“A hunter?” said Ardan."
" “猎人？ 我看到了。”樵夫回答。","“A hunter?Yes,” replied the bushman."
" “进去很久了吗？”","“Long ago?”"
" “大约有一个小时了。”","“About an hour.”"
"“太晚了！”马斯顿喊道。","“Too late!” cried Maston."
" “您有没有听见枪声？”阿当问。","“Have you heard any gunshots?” asked Ardan."
"“没有！”","“No!”"
" “一声都没听见吗？”","“Not one?”"
" “没有！那个猎人看上去好像不会打猎！”","“Not one! that hunter did not look as if he knew how to hunt!”"
" “我们现在怎么办呢？”马斯顿说。","“What is to be done?” said Maston."
" “就算是冒着平白无故挨一枪的危险，也要到树林里去。”","“We must go into the wood, at the risk of getting a ball which is not intended for us.”"
"“啊！”马斯顿叫道，他的声调绝不会让人误会他的意思，“我宁愿自己的脑袋挨二十枪，也不想让他中一枪。”","“Ah!” cried Maston, in a tone which could not be mistaken, “I would rather have twenty balls in my own head than one in Barbicane’s.”"
"“那我们就走吧，”阿当握了握他伙伴的手。","“Forward, then,” said Ardan, pressing his companion’s hand."
"一会儿的功夫，这两个朋友就消失在灌木丛中了。树林很密，遍地生长着高大的柏树、梧桐树、郁金香树、橄榄树、罗望子树、橡树和木兰。这些树的树枝旁逸斜出，纠缠交错，挡住了人的视线，看不到前方的路。米歇尔·阿当和马斯顿默默不语，肩并肩地走在高高的杂草中，分开结实的藤蔓，开辟出一条小路。二人边走边用探询的目光环顾着灌木丛，做好随时都可能听到枪声的心理准备。按理说，巴比康要是经过这里，应该会留下痕迹，但是他们什么也没发现。他们只能沿着隐约可见的小路往前走，在这条树阴浓密、暗无天日的小路上，印第安人曾经追踪过他们的敌人。","A few moments later the two friends had disappeared in the copse.It was a dense thicket, in which rose huge cypresses, sycamores, tulip-trees, olives, tamarinds, oaks, and magnolias.These different trees had interwoven their branches into an inextricable maze, through which the eye could not penetrate.Michel Ardan and Maston walked side by side in silence through the tall grass, cutting themselves a path through the strong creepers, casting curious glances on the bushes, and momentarily expecting to hear the sound of rifles.As for the traces which Barbicane ought to have left of his passage through the wood, there was not a vestige of them visible: so they followed the barely perceptible paths along which Indians had tracked some enemy, and which the dense foliage darkly overshadowed."
"一个小时徒劳的寻找让这两个人愈加焦急，他们停了下来。","After an hour spent in vain pursuit the two stopped in intensified anxiety."
"“决斗一定结束了。”马斯顿垂头丧气地说，“巴比康这个人从来不会跟敌人兜圈子，更不会暗算、使阴谋的！他太坦率，太勇敢了。他一定是大步向前，直接走进了危险的圈套。毫无疑问，樵夫离他太远了，风根本不可能把枪声传到那里。”","“It must be all over,” said Maston, discouraged.“A man like Barbicane would not dodge with his enemy, or ensnare him, would not even maneuver!He is too open, too brave.He has gone straight ahead, right into the danger, and doubtless far enough from the bushman for the wind to prevent his hearing the report of the rifles.”"
"“可是，如果有枪声的话，”米歇尔·阿当回答，“我们进了树林之后肯定能听见啊！”","“But surely,” replied Michel Ardan, “since we entered the wood we should have heard!”"
"“要是我们来晚了呢？”马斯顿绝望地叫起来。","“And what if we came too late?” cried Maston in tones of despair."
"阿当无言以对。他们两人又默默地、急匆匆地往前走。每隔一会儿，他们就扯着嗓门大喊巴比康和尼科尔的名字，可是没人回应。只有被叫声惊醒的鸟儿从他们眼前飞过，又消失在茂密的枝叶中，还有几只受惊的小鹿，慌慌张张地从他们面前飞奔而过。","For once Ardan had no reply to make, he and Maston resuming their walk in silence.From time to time, indeed, they raised great shouts, calling alternately Barbicane and Nicholl, neither of whom, however, answered their cries.Only the birds, awakened by the sound, flew past them and disappeared among the branches, while some frightened deer fled precipitately before them."
"两人又搜索了一个小时。大半个树林都被他们搜过来了。可还是没发现这两位斗士的一丝痕迹。况且，樵夫的话也不一定可信。阿当正要提议放弃这毫无意义的寻找，这时，马斯顿突然停了下来。","For another hour their search was continued.The greater part of the wood had been explored.There was nothing to reveal the presence of the combatants.The information of the bushman was after all doubtful, and Ardan was about to propose their abandoning this useless pursuit, when all at once Maston stopped."
"“嘘！”他轻声说，“前面有一个人！”","“Hush!” said he, “there is some one down there!”"
"“有人？”米歇尔·阿当重复了一遍。","“Some one?” repeated Michel Ardan."
"“是的，有人！他好像一动不动。手里并没有步枪。他在干什么呢？”","“Yes; a man!He seems motionless.His rifle is not in his hands.What can he be doing?”"
"“你能看清他是谁吗？”阿当问，在这种情况下，他那双近视眼就派不上什么用场了。","“But can you recognize him?” asked Ardan, whose short sight was of little use to him in such circumstances."
"“是的！是的！他正朝我们这边转头呢。”马斯顿回答。","“Yes! yes! He is turning toward us,” answered Maston."
"“他是？”","“And it is?”"
"“尼科尔上校！”","“Captain Nicholl!”"
"“尼科尔？”米歇尔·阿当喊道，心中一阵剧烈的悲痛。","“Nicholl?” cried Michel Ardan, feeling a terrible pang of grief."
"“尼科尔没有拿枪！这么说，他再也不用畏惧敌人了！”","“Nicholl unarmed!He has, then, no longer any fear of his adversary!”"
"“我们过去看看吧，”米歇尔·阿当说，“去看看是怎么回事。”","“Let us go to him,” said Michel Ardan, “and find out the truth.”"
"但是，他和他的伙伴才走了50步，就又停了下来，仔细地观察着上校。他们本以为会看到一个嗜血的魔鬼，一个以复仇为快乐的恶人。","But he and his companion had barely taken fifty steps, when they paused to examine the captain more attentively.They expected to find a bloodthirsty man, happy in his revenge."
"可是一看见他，两个人就惊呆了。","On seeing him, they remained stupefied."
"他们眼前是一张细密的蜘蛛网，悬在两棵大郁金香树之间，一只可怜的小鸟在这张大网正中挣扎，翅膀缠在网缝里，一边徒劳地扑腾着，一边发出凄惨的叫声。织网捕鸟者不是人类，而是本地特有的毒蜘蛛，它有企鹅蛋那么大，而且长着巨大的钳子。这个可恶的东西正要扑向它的猎物，却突然受到了一个更强大的敌人的威胁。它马上退了回来，逃到郁金香树高高的枝叶里避难去了。","A net, composed of very fine meshes, hung between two enormous tulip-trees, and in the midst of this snare, with its wings entangled, was a poor little bird, uttering pitiful cries, while it vainly struggled to escape.The bird-catcher who had laid this snare was no human being, but a venomous spider, peculiar to that country, as large as a pigeon’s egg, and armed with enormous claws.The hideous creature, instead of rushing on its prey, had beaten a sudden retreat and taken refuge in the upper branches of the tulip-tree, for a formidable enemy menaced its stronghold."
"这位敌人就是尼科尔，他见此情形，立刻把枪扔到地上，忘记了决斗的危险，看看能不能把那个被囚禁的小家伙从蜘蛛网上解救下来。他成功了，小鸟快乐地飞走，消失了。","Here, then, was Nicholl, his gun on the ground, forgetful of danger, trying if possible to save the victim from its cobweb prison.At last it was accomplished, and the little bird flew joyfully away and disappeared."
"尼科尔用怜爱的目光望着它飞走，这时，他突然听到一个充满深情的声音：","Nicholl lovingly watched its flight, when he heard these words pronounced by a voice full of emotion:"
"“您真是位勇士。”","“You are indeed a brave man.”"
"尼科尔转过身。米歇尔阿当正站在他面前，换了个语调说道：","He turned.Michel Ardan was before him, repeating in a different tone:"
"“而且是位善良的勇士！”","“And a kindhearted one!”"
"“米歇尔·阿当！”上校叫道，“你怎么在这？”","“Michel Ardan!” cried the captain.“Why are you here?”"
"“来和您握手，尼科尔，来阻止您和巴比康互相残杀。”","“To press your hand, Nicholl, and to prevent you from either killing Barbicane or being killed by him.”"
"“巴比康！”上校想起来了，“我找了他两个小时，也没见着他。他在哪儿藏着呢？”","“Barbicane!” returned the captain.“I have been looking for him for the last two hours in vain.Where is he hiding?”"
"“尼科尔！”米歇尔·阿当说，“您这样说就是失礼了！我们应该尊敬我们的敌人，放心吧，只要巴比康还活着，我们就一定能找到他的！假如他不是像您一样，正在解救受困的小鸟来给自己解闷，那他一定是正在找您呢。但是，本人要说的是，我们如果找到了他，你们之间的决斗就算了吧。”","“Nicholl!” said Michel Ardan, “this is not courteous! we ought always to treat an adversary with respect; rest assureed if Barbicane is still alive we shall find him all the more easily; because if he has not, like you, been amusing himself with freeing oppressed birds, he must be looking for you.When we have found him, Michel Ardan tells you this, there will be no duel between you.”"
"“我和巴比康主席有不共戴天之仇，”尼科尔严肃地答道，“我们必须决一——”","“Between President Barbicane and myself,” gravely replied Nicholl, “there is a rivalry which the death of one of us——”"
"“算了吧，算了吧！”阿当说，“像你们这样勇敢正直的两个人，不应该决斗！”","“Pooh, pooh!” said Ardan.“Brave fellows like you indeed! you shall not fight!”"
"“我必须同他决斗，先生！”","“I will fight, sir!”"
"“不要！”","“No!”"
"“上校，”J.T.马斯顿激动地说，“我是主席的好朋友，就像是另一个他，如果您真想杀，那就杀我吧！杀我跟杀他是一样的！”","“Captain,” said J. T. Maston, with much feeling, “I am a friend of the president’s, his alter ego, his second self; if you really must kill some one, shoot me! it will do just as well!”"
"“先生，”尼科尔答道，猛地握紧了枪，“您真是开玩笑——”","“Sir,” Nicholl replied, seizing his rifle convulsively, “these jokes——”"
"“我们的朋友马斯顿没有开玩笑，”阿当回答，“我完全能理解他愿意替朋友去死的心情。但是他和巴比康都不会死在您尼科尔上校的枪口下的。我有一个非常诱人的提议，能让您和他这两位对手都欣然接受。”","“Our friend Maston is not joking,” replied Ardan.“I fully understand his idea of being killed himself in order to save his friend.But neither he nor Barbicane will fall before the balls of Captain Nicholl.Indeed I have so attractive a proposal to make to the two rivals, that both will be eager to accept it.”"
"“什么提议？”尼科尔显然不信。","“What is it?” asked Nicholl with manifest incredulity."
"“别急！”阿当答道，“巴比康在场时我才能告诉你。”","“Patience!” exclaimed Ardan.“I can only reveal it in the presence of Barbicane.”"
"“那我们快去找他吧！”上校大声说。","“Let us go in search of him then!” cried the captain."
"三个人立即出发。上校卸下枪里的子弹，把它挂在肩上，静静地跟着他们走。又过了半个小时，搜寻还是没有结果。马斯顿被不祥的预感折磨着。他愤怒地盯着尼科尔，心里估量着，说不定上校的仇已经报了，可怜的巴比康中了弹，躺在血泊里，没准已经断气了呢。阿当似乎也产生了同样的想法，两个人都向上校投来了质疑的目光。这时，马斯顿突然停了下来。","The three men started off at once; the captain having discharged his rifle threw it over his shoulder, and advanced in silence.Another half hour passed, and the pursuit was still fruitless.Maston was oppressed by sinister forebodings.He looked fiercely at Nicholl, asking himself whether the captain’s vengeance had already been satisfied, and the unfortunate Barbicane, shot, was perhaps lying dead on some bloody track.The same thought seemed to occur to Ardan; and both were casting inquiring glances on Nicholl, when suddenly Maston paused."
"离他们20步远的地方，有个人一动不动地倚着一棵高大的梓树，半截身子被茂密的树叶挡住了。","The motionless figure of a man leaning against a gigantic catalpa twenty feet off appeared, half-veiled by the foliage."
"“是他！”马斯顿叫道。","“It is he!” said Maston."
"巴比康还是没动。阿当看看上校，上校并没有退缩。阿当喊着跑向主席：","Barbicane never moved.Ardan looked at the captain, but he did not wince.Ardan went forward crying:"
"“巴比康！巴比康！”","“Barbicane! Barbicane!”"
"他没回答！阿当奔向他的朋友，但是，正当他伸手去抓巴比康的胳膊时，他却突然怔住了，惊奇地叫出声来。","No answer!Ardan rushed toward his friend; but in the act of seizing his arms, he stopped short and uttered a cry of surprise."
"巴比康手里握着铅笔，正在本子上画着几何图形，他那只没装子弹的步枪平放在他身旁的地上。","Barbicane, pencil in hand, was tracing geometrical figures in a memorandum book, while his unloaded rifle lay beside him on the ground."
"他聚精会神地研究着，也和上校一样忘记了决斗，什么都看不见，也听不见。","Absorbed in his studies, Barbicane, in his turn forgetful of the duel, had seen and heard nothing."
"阿当握住他的手，巴比康才抬起头，诧异地打量着对方。","When Ardan took his hand, he looked up and stared at his visitor in astonishment."
"“啊，是你啊！”他终于大喊道，“我找到了，我的朋友，我找到了！”","“Ah, it is you!” he cried at last.“I have found it, my friend, I have found it!”"
"“什么？”","“What?”"
"“我的计划啊！”","“My plan!”"
"“什么计划？”","“What plan?”"
"“抵消炮弹发射时的后坐力的计划啊！”","“The plan for countering the effect of the shock at the departure of the projectile!”"
"“真的吗？”米歇尔·阿当兴奋地说，同时用眼角的余光瞥了瞥上校。","“Indeed?” said Michel Ardan, looking at the captain out of the corner of his eye."
"“嗯！用水！用水就行，把水当弹簧——啊！马斯顿，”巴比康叫道，“你也在这儿啊？”","“Yes! water! simply water, which will act as a spring—ah! Maston,” cried Barbicane, “you here also?”"
"“对，他也在，”阿当回答，“还有，请允许我把尊敬的尼科尔上校介绍给您！”","“Himself,” replied Ardan; “and permit me to introduce to you at the same time the worthy Captain Nicholl!”"
"“尼科尔！”巴比康立刻跳起来，叫道，“很抱歉，上校，我差点忘了——我准备好了！”","“Nicholl!” cried Barbicane, who jumped up at once.“Pardon me, captain, I had quite forgotten—I am ready!”"
"米歇尔·阿当没有给他们任何说话机会，抢着插了几句话。","Michel Ardan interfered, without giving the two enemies time to say anything more."
"“谢天谢地！”他说，“你们两位勇士没有过早碰头，真是件幸事！要不然，我们现在一定为你们中的某一个哀悼呢。不过无论如何，感谢老天，我们不用再担心了。你们一个对付蛛网，一个钻研力学，忘却了仇恨，这就表明你们之间的仇恨不是那么危险。”","“Thank heaven!” said he. “It is a happy thing that brave men like you two did not meet sooner! we should now have been mourning for one or other of you.But, thanks to Providence, which has interfered, there is now no further cause for alarm.When one forgets one’s anger in mechanics or in cobwebs, it is a sign that the anger is not dangerous.”"
"于是米歇尔·阿当告诉主席他们是怎么发现的上校。","Michel Ardan then told the president how the captain had been found occupied."
"“请问两位，”他总结道，“老天创造出像您二位这样的好人，难道是为了让你们相互开枪把对方的脑袋打碎吗？”","“I put it to you now,” said he in conclusion, “are two such good fellows as you are made on purpose to smash each other’s skulls with shot?”"
"当时的情景有点荒谬、有点出乎预料，鉴于此，米歇尔·阿当决定利用这一点化干戈为玉帛。","There was in “the situation” somewhat of the ridiculous, something quite unexpected; Michel Ardan saw this, and determined to effect a reconciliation."
"“我的好朋友们，”他带着神秘的微笑说，“你们之间不过是有点误会。没有什么深仇大恨！好了！为了证明你们之间的误会已经消除了，我真诚地希望你们接受我的提议。”","“My good friends,” said he, with his most bewitching smile, “this is nothing but a misunderstanding.Nothing more! well! to prove that it is all over between you, accept frankly the proposal I am going to make to you.”"
"“请说吧。”尼科尔说。","“Make it,” said Nicholl."
"“我们的朋友巴比康认为炮弹会直接飞到月球上，对吗？”","“Our friend Barbicane believes that his projectile will go straight to the moon?”"
"“是的，当然。”主席回答说。","“Yes, certainly,” replied the president."
"“但我们的朋友尼科尔认为它会掉回地球上，对吗？”","“And our friend Nicholl is persuaded it will fall back upon the earth?”"
"“我很确定。”上校喊道。","“I am certain of it,” cried the captain."
"“好！”阿当说，“我不能假装让你们和好，但是，我有个建议——你们和我一起去，看看我们的炮弹会不会中途停止。”","“Good!” said Ardan.“I cannot pretend to make you agree; but I suggest this: Go with me, and so see whether we are stopped on our journey.”"
"“什么？”J.T.马斯顿尖叫道，呆若木鸡。","“What?” exclaimed J. T. Maston, stupefied."
"一听到这个意外的提议，两个对手都定定地望着对方。巴比康想等上校回答。尼科尔却在等着主席的决定。","The two rivals, on this sudden proposal, looked steadily at each other.Barbicane waited for the captain’s answer.Nicholl watched for the decision of the president."
"“怎么样？”米歇尔问，“我们已经不用担心后坐力的问题了！”","“Well?” said Michel.“There is now no fear of the shock!”"
"“好吧！”巴比康叫道。","“Done!” cried Barbicane."
"尽管他说得很快，可尼科尔也同时把话说出了口。","But quickly as he pronounced the word, he was not before Nicholl."
"“好哇！好极了！嗨！嗨！好哇！”米歇尔一手拉住主席，一手拉住上校，欢呼起来，“既然问题都解决了，朋友们，我要以法国人的礼节犒劳犒劳你们。咱们去吃早餐吧！”","“Hurrah! bravo! hip! hip! hurrah!” cried Michel, giving a hand to each of the late adversaries.“Now that it is all settled, my friends, allow me to treat you after French fashion.Let us be off to breakfast!”"
"第二十二章 美国的新公民","CHAPTER XXII THE NEW CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES"
"当天，几乎所有的美国人都听说了尼科尔上校和巴比康主席要决斗的事情，以及那出人意料的结局。从那天起，米歇尔·阿当一刻都没有休息。来自合众国各个角落的代表团无休止地缠着他。不管他是否愿意，他都得接受所有的来访。他究竟握过多少双手，和多少个人“非常亲热地”聊过天，别人根本猜不到！如此成功的结果会使凡夫俗子飘飘欲仙的，但他却极力保持着恰到好处的半醉状态。","That same day all America heard of the affair of Captain Nicholl and President Barbicane, as well as its singular denouement.From that day forth, Michel Ardan had not one moment’s rest.Deputations from all corners of the Union harassed him without cessation or intermission.He was compelled to receive them all, whether he would or no. How many hands he shook, how many people he was “hail-fellow-well-met” with, it is impossible to guess!Such a triumphal result would have intoxicated any other man; but he managed to keep himself in a state of delightful semi-tipsiness."
"在围攻他的各种代表团中，有一个“月球人（‘精神病人’的谐音）”代表团，一直念念不忘这位未来“月球霸主”给他们带来的好处。美国有好多这样的可怜虫，有一天，他们中的一些人来拜访阿当，并请求和他一起返回自己的故乡。","Among the deputations of all kinds which assailed him, that of “The Lunatics” were careful not to forget what they owed to the future conqueror of the moon.One day, certain of these poor people, so numerous in America, came to call upon him, and requested permission to return with him to their native country."
"他答应那些人给他们在月球上的亲友捎信，才把他们打发走。他们走后，阿当对巴比康说：“十足的妄想！ 您相信月亮对精神疾病有影响吗？”","“Singular hallucination!” said he to Barbicane, after having dismissed the deputation with promises to convey numbers of messages to friends in the moon.“Do you believe in the influence of the moon upon distempers?”"
"“不怎么相信！”","“Scarcely!”"
"“我也不怎么相信，不过，历史上确实记载了一些非同寻常的事件。比如说1693年的那场瘟疫吧，一大批人就是在月蚀出现时死去的。著名的培根总是在月蚀之时晕厥过去。1399年，查理六世的疯病复发了六次，不是在新月之时就是在满月之时。根据高尔的观察，精神病患者每个月都会犯病两次，也就是在新月和满月时。事实上，有数不清的案例，像热病、梦游症，还有其他一些疾病，似乎都证明了月球的确对人类有着某种神秘的影响。”","“No more do I, despite some remarkable recorded facts of history.For instance, during an epidemic in 1693, a large number of persons died at the very moment of an eclipse.The celebrated Bacon always fainted during an eclipse.Charles VI relapsed six times into madness during the year 1399, sometimes during the new, sometimes during the full moon.Gall observed that insane persons underwent an accession of their disorder twice in every month, at the epochs of new and full moon.In fact, numerous observations made upon fevers, somnambulisms, and other human maladies, seem to prove that the moon does exercise some mysterious influence upon man.”"
"“但它是怎么影响的，原因又何在啊？”巴比康问。","“But the how and the wherefore?” asked Barbicane."
"“唔，这个嘛，普卢塔克曾经说过一句话，1900年后，阿拉果又借用过它，我也只能借用它来回答你了。‘也许，根本就没那回事儿！’”","“Well, I can only give you the answer which Arago borrowed from Plutarch, which is nineteen centuries old. ‘Perhaps the stories are not true!’”"
"在最风光的时期，米歇尔·阿当不得已经历了成名后随之而来的各种烦恼。娱乐场所的经理们想把他像珍宝一样展览。巴纳姆出价一百万美金，请阿当在全美国进行巡演。至于他的照片，各种尺寸应有尽有，他的肖像也是造型各异。转眼之间，他的照片就卖出了500多万张。","In the height of his triumph, Michel Ardan had to encounter all the annoyances incidental to a man of celebrity.Managers of entertainments wanted to exhibit him.Barnum offered him a million dollars to make a tour of the United States in his show.As for his photographs, they were sold of all size, and his portrait taken in every imaginable posture.More than half a million copies were disposed of in an incredibly short space of time."
"阿当不仅是男人们的偶像，也是女人们心中的英雄。他要是想稳定下来安个家，没准儿都结过一百次婚了。尤其是那些四十多岁的老处女，她们风韵已逝、青春不再，但还是日日夜夜抱着他的照片幻想着。即使他提出陪他一同上天的条件，也会有几百号女人抢着要跟他结婚。然而，米歇尔可一点儿都不想把一大群法美混血儿带到月球上去。","But it was not only the men who paid him homage, but the women as well.He might have married well a hundred times over, if he had been willing to settle in life.The old maids, in particular, of forty years and upward, and dry in proportion, devoured his photographs day and night.They would have married him by hundreds, even if he had imposed upon them the condition of accompanying him into space.He had, however, no intention of transplanting a race of Franco-Americans upon the surface of the moon."
"于是他婉言拒绝了所有人的请求。","He therefore declined all offers."
"他一从这些尴尬的游行中脱开身，就赶快在朋友的陪同下参观了哥伦比亚大炮。他对眼前的大炮赞不绝口，还下到了这架巨型机器的底部，不久的将来，它就要发射炮弹，把他送到月球上去了。在这里，我们有必要提一下J. T. 马斯顿的提议。当枪炮俱乐部的秘书看到巴比康和尼科尔答应了米歇尔·阿当的提议时，他也决心加入其中，和大家来一次四人旅行。于是有一天，马斯顿提出了自己的想法，决意成为他们中的一员。巴比康倍感为难地拒绝了他，他头头是道地向马斯顿解释，炮弹是不可能装下这么多人的。马斯顿非常失望，只好找米歇尔·阿当帮忙，可阿当也劝他放弃，还从个人角度出发为他列出了一两条理由。","As soon as he could withdraw from these somewhat embarrassing demonstrations, he went, accompanied by his friends, to pay a visit to the Columbiad.He was highly gratified by his inspection, and made the descent to the bottom of the tube of this gigantic machine which was presently to launch him to the regions of the moon.It is necessary here to mention a proposal of J. T. Maston’s.When the secretary of the Gun Club found that Barbicane and Nicholl accepted the proposal of Michel Ardan, he determined to join them, and make one of a smug party of four.So one day he determined to be admitted as one of the travelers.Barbicane, pained at having to refuse him, gave him clearly to understand that the projectile could not possibly contain so many passengers.Maston, in despair, went in search of Michel Ardan, who counseled him to resign himself to the situation, adding one or two arguments ad hominem."
"“老兄，你看，”他说，“我的话没有恶意，不过说实在的，我们几个当中，你的身体条件太不完善，是最不适合去月球的！”","“You see, old fellow,” he said, “you must not take what I say in bad part; but really, between ourselves, you are in too incomplete a condition to appear in the moon!”"
"“你的意思是说我缺胳膊少腿吗？”这个英勇的残疾人尖叫起来。","“Incomplete?” shrieked the valiant invalid."
"“是的，我的好兄弟！想一想，我们要是在那里遇见了月球居民呢！你希望让他们看见你现在的样子、让他们知道地球上发生的一切有多么悲惨吗？你要告诉他们什么是战争，让他们知道我们把主要时间浪费在尔虞我诈、相互残杀上，告诉他们这些事情就发生在本来可以养活一千亿人、而实际上只有两亿人的地球上吗？我们为什么要这样做呢？我的朋友，这就是我们不得不拒绝你的原因！”","“Yes, my dear fellow! imagine our meeting some of the inhabitants up there!Would you like to give them such a melancholy notion of what goes on down here? to teach them what war is, to inform them that we employ our time chiefly in devouring each other, in smashing arms and legs, and that too on a globe which is capable of supporting a hundred billions of inhabitants, and which actually does contain nearly two hundred millions?Why, my worthy friend, we should have to turn you out of doors!”"
"“可是，如果你们被炮弹晃得缺胳膊少腿的，到了那儿不也和我一样变成残废了嘛。”","“But still, if you arrive there in pieces, you will be as incomplete as I am.”"
"“你说得很对，“米歇尔·阿当回答，“但是我们不会缺胳膊少腿的。”","“Unquestionably,” replied Michel Ardan; “but we shall not.”"
"事实上，10月18号的一次预备实验取得了圆满的结果，这让他们对未来的成功抱有很大的希望。巴比康主席很想知道炮弹发射那一刻的反冲力到底有多大，于是他从彭萨科拉的兵工厂弄来了一尊38英寸的迫击炮。他把这尊炮弹安置在西尔斯伯勒的海岸边，这样，炮弹就可以落进海里，不会造成震动。他的目的是搞清炮弹发射时的反冲力有多大，而不是落地时的。","In fact, a preparatory experiment, tried on the 18th of October, had yielded the best results and caused the most well-grounded hopes of success.Barbicane, desirous of obtaining some notion of the effect of the shock at the moment of the projectile’s departure, had procured a 38-inch mortar from the arsenal of Pensacola.He had this placed on the bank of Hillisborough Roads, in order that the shell might fall back into the sea, and the shock be thereby destroyed.His object was to ascertain the extent of the shock of departure, and not that of the return."
"他们为这次有趣的实验准备了一发空心炮弹。空心炮弹的内壁覆盖着一层优质钢制成的弹簧网，弹簧网上固定着一层厚厚的垫子。简直就是一座精心搭建的鸟巢。","A hollow projectile had been prepared for this curious experiment.A thick padding fastened upon a kind of elastic network, made of the best steel, lined the inside of the walls.It was a veritable nest most carefully wadded."
"“真遗憾，这里没有我的地方。”J. T. 马斯顿惆怅地说道，他很后悔自己长得太高，不能加入这次冒险。","“What a pity I can’t find room in there,” said J. T. Maston, regretting that his height did not allow of his trying the adventure."
"炮弹里关着一只大猫和一只松鼠，松鼠是J. T. 马斯顿养的，他特别喜欢这小东西。大家很想知道这种最不怕晕的小动物能否经受住这次实验旅行的考验。","Within this shell were shut up a large cat, and a squirrel belonging to J. T. Maston, and of which he was particularly fond.They were desirous, however, of ascertaining how this little animal, least of all others subject to giddiness, would endure this experimental voyage."
"大炮里装了160磅火药，炮弹也被装进了炮膛。刚一点火，炮弹就以极快的速度窜上天，画出一道雄伟的抛物线，在大约1,000英尺处达到最高点，紧接着沿着一条优美的曲线下落，落入海边停泊着的船只中间。","The mortar was charged with 160 pounds of powder, and the shell placed in the chamber.On being fired, the projectile rose with great velocity, described a majestic parabola, attained a height of about a thousand feet, and with a graceful curve descended in the midst of the vessels that lay there at anchor."
"安排好的小船一分钟都没有耽误，立即划向炮弹落水的方向，几个潜水员跳进水里，用绳子捆住炮弹，很快就把它拖上了船。从把小动物关进炮弹，到打开这间小牢房的盖子，总共还不到五分钟。","Without a moment’s loss of time a small boat put off in the direction of its fall; some divers plunged into the water and attached ropes to the handles of the shell, which was quickly dragged on board.Five minutes did not elapse between the moment of enclosing the animals and that of unscrewing the coverlid of their prison."
"阿当、巴比康、马斯顿和尼科尔都在船上帮助工作人员工作，心中无比好奇，这一点是非常容易理解的。还没等盖子完全打开，里面的猫就急忙跳了出来，它受了点小伤，但还是充满活力，根本就看不出刚刚在空中折腾过一番。但是，松鼠却不见了。最后，真相大明了——它是被旅伴给吃了！","Ardan, Barbicane, Maston, and Nicholl were present on board the boat, and assisted at the operation with an interest which may readily be comprehended.Hardly had the shell been opened when the cat leaped out, slightly bruised, but full of life, and exhibiting no signs whatever of having made an aerial expedition.No trace, however, of the squirrel could be discovered.The truth at last became apparent—the cat had eaten its fellow-traveler!"
"J. T. 马斯顿失去了可怜的松鼠，非常心疼，于是他提议把它同其他为科学献身的烈士一起，载入史册。","J. T. Maston grieved much for the loss of his poor squirrel, and proposed to add its case to that of other martyrs to science."
"这次实验的大功告成让所有的恐惧都灰飞烟灭了。此外，巴比康设计的炮弹会更加完美，几乎能消除炮弹发射时全部的反冲力。现在万事俱备，只欠东风了！","After this experiment all hesitation, all fear disappeared.Besides, Barbicane’s plans would ensure greater perfection for his projectile, and go far to annihilate altogether the effects of the shock.Nothing now remained but to go!"
"两天以后，米歇尔·阿当收到了美国总统的一封信，授予他一个让他非常感动的荣誉。","Two days later Michel Ardan received a message from the President of the United States, an honor of which he showed himself especially sensible."
"美国政府，援引他的同胞——大名鼎鼎的费耶特侯爵的事迹，授予米歇尔·阿当“美利坚合众国公民”的称号。","After the example of his illustrious fellow-countryman, the Marquis de la Fayette, the government had decreed to him the title of “Citizen of the United States of America.”"
"第二十三章 炮弹车厢","CHAPTER XXIII THE PROJECTILE-VEHICLE"
"哥伦比亚大炮铸好以后，公众的兴趣都集中到了炮弹上。因为这三位勇敢的冒险家要乘坐这发炮弹飞往太空。","On the completion of the Columbiad the public interest centered in the projectile itself, the vehicle which was destined to carry the three hardy adventurers into space."
"新的计划已送交到奥尔巴尼的布里杜威尔公司，要求他们尽快完成制造。炮弹最终于11月2日制造完成，并立即通过东方铁路运往乱石岗。当月10日，炮弹顺利到达了目的地，那里，米歇尔·阿当、巴比康和尼科尔正怀着焦急的心情等待着。。","The new plans had been sent to Breadwill and Co., of Albany, with the request for their speedy execution.The projectile was consequently cast on the 2nd of November, and immediately forwarded by the Eastern Railway to Stones Hill, which it reached without accident on the 10th of that month, where Michel Ardan, Barbicane, and Nicholl were waiting impatiently for it."
"炮弹里要装上三英尺深的水，用来支撑一只防水的木制圆盘，这个圆盘能够在炮弹内壁自由移动。乘客们即将乘坐的就是这样一只木筏。水被一层层的水平隔板隔开，发射时产生的冲力会相继撞裂这些隔板。随后，每一层的水，从水位最低的到水位最高的，顺次流进排水管，从炮弹的顶端排出去，这就起到了弹簧的作用。而圆木盘本身也装有许多弹性超强的弹簧，只有在隔板一个个被撞裂以后才会碰到最底部。毫无疑问，在水完全排出之后，乘客们仍会受到猛烈的冲力，但是，这套强大的弹簧装置几乎能把最初的冲力完全抵消。炮弹内壁上半部分要贴上一层厚厚的皮垫，底下固定着最好的钢弹簧，排水管就隐藏在皮垫下面，外面一点也看不出来。这样，为了抵消发射时的冲力，一切可能想到的预防措施都被采用了。正如米歇尔·阿当所说，除非制造炮弹的材料太差，他们才会被压扁。","The projectile had now to be filled to the depth of three feet with a bed of water, intended to support a water-tight wooden disc, which worked easily within the walls of the projectile.It was upon this kind of raft that the travelers were to take their place.This body of water was divided by horizontal partitions, which the shock of the departure would have to break in succession.Then each sheet of the water, from the lowest to the highest, running off into escape tubes toward the top of the projectile, constituted a kind of spring; and the wooden disc, supplied with extremely powerful plugs, could not strike the lowest plate except after breaking successively the different partitions.Undoubtedly the travelers would still have to encounter a violent recoil after the complete escapement of the water; but the first shock would be almost entirely destroyed by this powerful spring.The upper parts of the walls were lined with a thick padding of leather, fastened upon springs of the best steel, behind which the escape tubes were completely concealed; thus all imaginable precautions had been taken for averting the first shock; and if they did get crushed, they must, as Michel Ardan said, be made of very bad materials."
"这发巨大金属炮弹的入口是圆锥壁上的一个小洞。洞门是一块严丝合缝的铝板，并从里面用结实的螺丝紧紧拧住。这样一来，乘客们一到达月球，就可以自如地从那监牢般的炮弹里走出来。","The entrance into this metallic tower was by a narrow aperture contrived in the wall of the cone.This was hermetically closed by a plate of aluminum, fastened internally by powerful screw-pressure.The travelers could therefore quit their prison at pleasure, as soon as they should reach the moon."
"四个舷窗用来透光和看风景。舷窗上装着厚厚的凸透镜，其中两个在圆锥壁上，第三个在炮弹底部，第四个在顶部。舷窗周围的凹槽内镶嵌着金属护窗板，保护舷窗免受发射时的冲击，只需从里面松一下螺丝，舷窗就可以向外打开。几只用来盛放水和必需品的容器被牢牢地固定在炮弹里，还有一只好几个大气压的特制煤气箱，用于生火和照明。只消打开开关，煤气就可以给这个舒适的车厢带来６小时的光照和温暖。","Light and view were given by means of four thick lenticular glass scuttles, two pierced in the circular wall itself, the third in the bottom, the fourth in the top. These scuttles then were protected against the shock of departure by plates let into solid grooves, which could easily be opened outward by unscrewing them from the inside.Reservoirs firmly fixed contained water and the necessary provisions; and fire and light were procurable by means of gas, contained in a special reservoir under a pressure of several atmospheres.They had only to turn a tap, and for six hours the gas would light and warm this comfortable vehicle."
"只剩下空气的问题需要解决了。巴比康、他的两个同伴和他计划携带的两条狗都要消耗炮弹里的空气，因此必须时常给炮弹更换新鲜空气。众所周知，空气的主要成分包括21%的氧气和79%的氮气。人的肺部会吸入维持生命所必需的氧气，呼出氮气。因此,呼出的空气中氧气减少了5%，同时增加了几乎同样体积的二氧化碳，这是血素氧化以后的产物。因此，在一个密封的空间里，经过一段时间，空气中所有的氧气都会被二氧化碳取代——这是一种致命的气体。因此，有两件事需要解决：首先要补充消耗掉的氧气，其次要清除呼出的二氧化碳。只要利用氯酸钾和苛性钾，两个问题就都迎刃而解了。氯酸钾是一种白色的晶体盐，加热到400度以上时就会生成氯化钾，并释放出全部的氧。28磅的氯酸钾能生成7磅的氧气，也就是2,400公升——这些氧气足够乘客使用24小时。","There now remained only the question of air; for allowing for the consumption of air by Barbicane, his two companions, and two dogs which he proposed taking with him, it was necessary to renew the air of the projectile.Now air consists principally of twenty-one parts of oxygen and seventy-nine of nitrogen. The lungs absorb the oxygen, which is indispensable for the support of life, and reject the nitrogen. The air expired loses nearly five per cent. of the former and contains nearly an equal volume of carbonic acid, produced by the combustion of the elements of the blood.In an air-tight enclosure, then, after a certain time, all the oxygen of the air will be replaced by the carbonic acid—a gas fatal to life.There were two things to be done then—first, to replace the absorbed oxygen; secondly, to destroy the expired carbonic acid; both easy enough to do, by means of chlorate of potassium and caustic potash.The former is a salt which appears under the form of white crystals; when raised to a temperature of 400 degrees it is transformed into chlorure of potassium, and the oxygen which it contains is entirely liberated.Now twenty-eight pounds of chlorate of potassium produces seven pounds of oxygen, or 2,400 litres—the quantity necessary for the travelers during twenty-four hours."
"苛性钾对空气中二氧化碳的吸收力极强。只要把它摇一摇，它就能吸收二氧化碳，同时生成碳酸氢钾。把这两种方法结合在一起，就能把污浊的空气更新为生存所必须的新鲜空气。","Caustic potash has a great affinity for carbonic acid; and it is sufficient to shake it in order for it to seize upon the acid and form bicarbonate of potassium.By these two means they would be enabled to restore to the vitiated air its life-supporting properties."
"然而，有必要补充的是，这种方法迄今为止只在动物身上试验过。不管这种方法具有多大的科学性和精确性，他们仍不知道它能否应用于人类。J. T. 马斯顿积极提议亲自试验一下这种方法是否有效，这对他来说是一种荣耀。","It is necessary, however, to add that the experiments had hitherto been made in anima vili.Whatever its scientific accuracy was, they were at present ignorant how it would answer with human beings.The honor of putting it to the proof was energetically claimed by J. T. Maston."
"“既然我去不了月球，”这位勇敢的大炮发明家说，“至少应该让我在炮弹里住上一个星期吧。”","“Since I am not to go,” said the brave artillerist, “I may at least live for a week in the projectile.”"
"人们很难拒绝他的提议，于是便顺从了他的意愿。他们准备了足够的氯酸钾和苛性钾供他使用，还有八天的粮食。11月12日早上6时，在严厉叮嘱朋友们不要在20日之前打开洞门之后，他和他们一一握手，随后爬进炮弹，洞口立刻严丝合缝地关闭了。他是怎样度过这一周的时间的呢？他们一无所知。弹壁太厚了，里面的声音传不到外面。12月20日下午6时整，洞门打开了。马斯顿的朋友们都忐忑不安地等待着，但很快他们，悬着的心落地了，因为他们听到一声快活的呼喊：“万岁！“","It would have been hard to refuse him; so they consented to his wish.A sufficient quantity of chlorate of potassium and of caustic potash was placed at his disposal, together with provisions for eight days.And having shaken hands with his friends, on the 12th of November, at six o’clock A.M., after strictly informing them not to open his prison before the 20th, at six o’clock P.M., he slid down the projectile, the plate of which was at once hermetically sealed.What did he do with himself during that week?They could get no information.The thickness of the walls of the projectile prevented any sound reaching from the inside to the outside.On the 20th of November, at six P.M. exactly, the plate was opened.The friends of J. T. Maston had been all along in a state of much anxiety; but they were promptly reassured on hearing a jolly voice shouting a boisterous hurrah."
"不一会儿，枪炮俱乐部的秘书就以胜利者的姿态出现在圆锥体的顶端。他变胖了！","Presently afterward the secretary of the Gun Club appeared at the top of the cone in a triumphant attitude.He had grown fat!"
"第二十四章 落基山的望远镜","CHAPTER XXIV THE TELESCOPE OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS"
"去年10月20日募捐结束之后，枪炮俱乐部的主席曾拨款给剑桥天文台，用于制造一架大型的光学仪器。之所以制造这架仪器，是为了能观测到月球表面任何一个直径大于九英尺的物体。","On the 20th of October in the preceding year, after the close of the subscription, the president of the Gun Club had credited the Observatory of Cambridge with the necessary sums for the construction of a gigantic optical instrument.This instrument was designed for the purpose of rendering visible on the surface of the moon any object exceeding nine feet in diameter."
"在枪炮俱乐部实施他们伟大实验的那个年代，这种仪器的性能已经非常完美，其中不乏一些优秀的产品。尤其是当时的两台望远镜，体积巨大，性能超群。第一台是由赫歇耳制造的，长36英尺，镜头是一面4英尺6英寸的反光镜，放大率为6,000倍。第二架是罗斯勋爵的，伫立在爱尔兰的派生顿公园。这架望远镜长48英尺，镜面是直径6英尺的反光镜，放大倍数可达6,400倍。这台望远镜重达12吨半，因此必须要用砖石建筑物来支撑它。","At the period when the Gun Club essayed their great experiment, such instruments had reached a high degree of perfection, and produced some magnificent results.Two telescopes in particular, at this time, were possessed of remarkable power and of gigantic dimensions.The first, constructed by Herschel, was thirty-six feet in length, and had an object-glass of four feet six inches; it possessed a magnifying power of 6,000.The second was raised in Ireland, in Parsonstown Park, and belongs to Lord Rosse.The length of this tube is forty-eight feet, and the diameter of its object-glass six feet; it magnifies 6,400 times, and required an immense erection of brick work and masonry for the purpose of working it, its weight being twelve and a half tons."
"不过，虽然这些仪器体型庞大，但实际放大倍数却很少能超过6,000倍。因此，月球的视觉距离只能被缩小到39英里，直径不到60英尺的物体，除非很长，否则根本观察不到。","Still, despite these colossal dimensions, the actual enlargements scarcely exceeded 6,000 times in round numbers; consequently, the moon was brought within no nearer an apparent distance than thirty-nine miles; and objects of less than sixty feet in diameter, unless they were of very considerable length, were still imperceptible."
"目前来看，要想观测直径九英尺、长15英尺的炮弹，就必须把月球的视觉距离缩短到最多五英尺。要达到这一目的，望远镜的放大率必须要达到48,000倍。","In the present case, dealing with a projectile nine feet in diameter and fifteen feet long, it became necessary to bring the moon within an apparent distance of five miles at most; and for that purpose to establish a magnifying power of 48,000 times."
"这就是摆在剑桥天文台面前的问题。资金并不缺，难就难在建造上。","Such was the question proposed to the Observatory of Cambridge. There was no lack of funds; the difficulty was purely one of construction."
"经过多次探讨，确定了仪器的最佳构造和建造原则之后，工作总算开始了。根据剑桥天文台的计算，新反射镜的镜筒长度要达到280英尺，镜片直径要达到16英尺。这些尺寸看上去挺大，但与几年前天文学家胡克设计的10,000英寸的望远镜相比，已经算小的了！","After considerable discussion as to the best form and principle of the proposed instrument the work was finally commenced.According to the calculations of the Observatory of Cambridge, the tube of the new reflector would require to be 280 feet in length, and the object-glass sixteen feet in diameter.Colossal as these dimensions may appear, they were diminutive in comparison with the 10,000 foot telescope proposed by the astronomer Hooke only a few years ago!"
"关于安放地点，很快就确定了。地点要选在某座高山上，而在美国，这样的高山寥寥无几。实际上，美国只有两条海拔不是很高的山脉，美丽的密西西比河在它们之间奔流，被北方佬称作“江河之王”。","Regarding the choice of locality, that matter was promptly determined.The object was to select some lofty mountain, and there are not many of these in the United States.In fact there are but two chains of moderate elevation, between which runs the magnificent Mississippi, the “king of rivers” as these Republican Yankees delight to call it."
"一条是东部的阿巴拉契亚山脉，它的最高峰位于新汉普郡境内，海拔不过5,600英尺。","Eastwards rise the Appalachians, the very highest point of which, in New Hampshire, does not exceed the very moderate altitude of 5,600 feet."
"另一条山脉是西部的落基山脉。这条巨大的山脉起始于麦哲伦海峡，沿着南美洲西海岸上行——在那里，它被称为安第斯山脉或科迪勒拉山脉，接着横穿巴拿马地峡，北上经过整个北美洲，一直延伸到到北极海岸。落基山脉最高峰的海拔仍然只有10,700英尺。但是，由于枪炮俱乐部的成员们坚持要把望远镜和哥伦比亚大炮放在美国境内，所以他们不得不满足于这个高度。于是，所有必需的装备都被运送到密苏里州境内的朗斯峰上。","On the west, however, rise the Rocky Mountains, that immense range which, commencing at the Straights of Magellan, follows the western coast of Southern America under the name of the Andes or the Cordilleras, until it crosses the Isthmus of Panama, and runs up the whole of North America to the very borders of the Polar Sea.The highest elevation of this range still does not exceed 10,700 feet.With this elevation, nevertheless, the Gun Club were compelled to be content, inasmuch as they had determined that both telescope and Columbiad should be erected within the limits of the Union.All the necessary apparatus was consequently sent on to the summit of Long’s Peak, in the territory of Missouri."
"美国工程师在制造望远镜时所克服的各种困难，以及他们非凡的勇气和精湛的技术，是任何文笔、任何语言都无法形容的。他们要把笨重的大石头、大块的铁板、沉重的老虎钳，以及巨大的镜筒部件，还有重达三万来磅的镜头，运到海拔10,000多英尺、终年积雪的山上。他们要穿过荒凉的草原、茂密的森林，跨越可怕的湍流，在这些远离人烟的蛮夷之地，生活的基本需要几乎都无法满足。然而，尽管有数不清的困难，美国人的才智还是最终取得了胜利。九月底，工程开始仅仅不到一年时间，这架高280英尺、直入云霄的庞大反射镜就建成了。反射镜被固定在一座高大的铁架上；这架精巧的仪器能轻而易举地观察到天空中的任意一点，捕捉到星体从一个区域运行到另一个区域的全过程。","Neither pen nor language can describe the difficulties of all kinds which the American engineers had to surmount, of the prodigies of daring and skill which they accomplished.They had to raise enormous stones, massive pieces of wrought iron, heavy corner-clamps and huge portions of cylinder, with an object-glass weighing nearly 30,000 pounds, above the line of perpetual snow for more than 10,000 feet in height, after crossing desert prairies, impenetrable forests, fearful rapids, far from all centers of population, and in the midst of savage regions, in which every detail of life becomes an almost insoluble problem.And yet, notwithstanding these innumerable obstacles, American genius triumphed.In less than a year after the commencement of the works, toward the close of September, the gigantic reflector rose into the air to a height of 280 feet.It was raised by means of an enormous iron crane; an ingenious mechanism allowed it to be easily worked toward all the points of the heavens, and to follow the stars from the one horizon to the other during their journey through the heavens."
"这项工程花费了40万美元。当它第一次瞄准月球时，观测人员既好奇又不安。通过这架放大倍数高达48,000倍的望远镜，他们能观测到什么呢？他们会观测到月球的居民、动物、城镇、湖泊、海洋吗？没有！他们看到的只是科学界早已发现的东西！月盘上每一处都准确无误地证明了月球的火山岩性质。","It had cost $400,000.The first time it was directed toward the moon the observers evinced both curiosity and anxiety.What were they about to discover in the field of this telescope which magnified objects 48,000 times?Would they perceive peoples, herds of lunar animals, towns, lakes, seas?No! there was nothing which science had not already discovered! and on all the points of its disc the volcanic nature of the moon became determinable with the utmost precision."
"但是，早为枪炮俱乐部效力之前，落基山上的这架望远镜已为天文事业作出了不少贡献。多亏它强大的观察力，宇宙的广度被推到了极限，许多恒星的视直径得到了精确地测量。剑桥天文台的克拉克先生就是用它观测到了金牛座的蟹状星云，这一点是罗斯勋爵的望远镜无法企及的。","But the telescope of the Rocky Mountains, before doing its duty to the Gun Club, rendered immense services to astronomy.Thanks to its penetrative power, the depths of the heavens were sounded to the utmost extent; the apparent diameter of a great number of stars was accurately measured; and Mr. Clark, of the Cambridge staff, resolved the Crab nebula in Taurus, which the reflector of Lord Rosse had never been able to decompose."
"第二十五章 最后的准备","CHAPTER XXV FINAL DETAILS"
"11月12日，距最后的发射日期还有10天。再完成一项工作就一切圆满了。这是一项棘手而危险的工作，需要极细致的预防措施，需要细心和耐心的工作。尼科尔上校曾投下第三把赌注，赌这项工作不能成功。其实，这项工作就是给哥伦比亚大炮装上炮弹，并塞入400,000磅的火棉。尼科尔的考虑也不无道理，处理如此大量的低氮硝化纤维很有可能会酿成严重的灾难。低氮硝化纤维可燃性极强，在炮弹压力的作用下很有可能自燃。","It was the 22nd of November; the departure was to take place in ten days.One operation alone remained to be accomplished to bring all to a happy termination; an operation delicate and perilous, requiring infinite precautions, and against the success of which Captain Nicholl had laid his third bet. It was, in fact, nothing less than the loading of the Columbiad, and the introduction into it of 400,000 pounds of gun-cotton.Nicholl had thought, not perhaps without reason, that the handling of such formidable quantities of pyroxyle would, in all probability, involve a grave catastrophe; and at any rate, that this immense mass of eminently inflammable matter would inevitably ignite when submitted to the pressure of the projectile."
"美国人一向的粗心使危险系数更高了，好在巴比康一心想要成功，所以做足了一切可能的防御工作。首先，他在往乱石岗运火棉的事情上非常细心。他让人每次少运，运送过程中火药都被装在密封的大桶里。火药通过铁路从坦帕城运往目的地，到达以后，再由赤脚的工人卸下来，搬到哥伦比亚大炮跟前，最后，再用事先放在炮筒旁的起重机送到预定的位置。所有的蒸汽机都搬离了运输现场，二英里之内见不到一丁点儿的火星。","There were indeed dangers accruing as before from the carelessness of the Americans, but Barbicane had set his heart on success, and took all possible precautions.In the first place, he was very careful as to the transportation of the gun-cotton to Stones Hill.He had it conveyed in small quantities, carefully packed in sealed cases.These were brought by rail from Tampa Town to the camp, and from thence were taken to the Columbiad by barefooted workmen, who deposited them in their places by means of cranes placed at the orifice of the cannon.No steam-engine was permitted to work, and every fire was extinguished within two miles of the works."
"虽然已是11月份，他们依然不敢在白天干活，恐怕阳光照在火棉上会产生危险的后果。因此，他们选择在夜间工作，利用鲁姆科尔夫的真空照明装置，用人造光照亮哥伦比亚大炮的底部。一筒筒火药整整齐齐地排放在那里，用金属丝捆在一起，到时候用来同步传导电火花，以点燃这一大堆火棉。","Even in November they feared to work by day, lest the sun’s rays acting on the gun-cotton might lead to unhappy results.This led to their working at night, by light produced in a vacuum by means of Ruhmkorff’s apparatus, which threw an artificial brightness into the depths of the Columbiad.There the cartridges were arranged with the utmost regularity, connected by a metallic thread, destined to communicate to them all simultaneously the electric spark, by which means this mass of gun-cotton was eventually to be ignited."
"到11月28日，800只火药筒整整齐齐地码在了哥伦比亚大炮底部。到目前为止，工作一切顺利！但是，巴比康主席经历了多少困惑、多少担忧、多少艰难啊！巴比康不许人们进入乱石岗，可他的努力往往都白费了。每天都有好奇的人爬进栅栏，甚至有几个人鲁莽到极点，竟然在一捆捆火棉附近抽烟。巴比康时刻保持警惕。仅次于巴比康，J. T. 马斯顿也在竭尽全力驱赶入侵者，小心翼翼地拾起美国佬乱丢的未熄灭的雪茄烟头。鉴于有300,000多人聚集在围栏周围，这真是件令人头疼的工作！米歇尔·阿当自告奋勇，要亲自指挥工人们把弹药运到哥伦比亚大炮的炮筒旁。但是，当他看到主席一边驱赶着那些胆大的参观者，一边自己嘴里叼着根大雪茄，着实吓了一大跳。这可给旁观者树立了一个危险的榜样。因此，阿当很不放心这位大胆的吸烟者，不得不对他进行特别监督。","By the 28th of November eight hundred cartridges had been placed in the bottom of the Columbiad.So far the operation had been successful!But what confusion, what anxieties, what struggles were undergone by President Barbicane!In vain had he refused admission to Stones Hill; every day the inquisitive neighbors scaled the palisades, some even carrying their imprudence to the point of smoking while surrounded by bales of gun-cotton.Barbicane was in a perpetual state of alarm.J. T. Maston seconded him to the best of his ability, by giving vigorous chase to the intruders, and carefully picking up the still lighted cigar ends which the Yankees threw about.A somewhat difficult task! seeing that more than 300,000 persons were gathered round the enclosure.Michel Ardan had volunteered to superintend the transport of the cartridges to the mouth of the Columbiad; but the president, having surprised him with an enormous cigar in his mouth, while he was hunting out the rash spectators to whom he himself offered so dangerous an example, saw that he could not trust this fearless smoker, and was therefore obliged to mount a special guard over him."
"后来，好在上天助他一臂之力，运输工作顺利完成。尼科尔打的第三个赌就这样输掉了。现在，就剩下把炮弹装进哥伦比亚大炮，放在柔软的火棉层上了。","At last, Providence being propitious, this wonderful loading came to a happy termination, Captain Nicholl’s third bet being thus lost.It remained now to introduce the projectile into the Columbiad, and to place it on its soft bed of gun-cotton."
"但在这之前，必须先把行程的必需品仔细地安放在炮弹车厢里。必需品很多，如果遂了阿当的心意，那么就没有乘客的空间了。简直无法想象这位可爱的法国人要带多少东西去月球。很多东西都毫无用处！不过巴比康出来干涉了，不许他带任何没用的东西。工具箱里只有几只温度计、气压表和望远镜。","But before doing this, all those things necessary for the journey had to be carefully arranged in the projectile vehicle.These necessaries were numerous; and had Ardan been allowed to follow his own wishes, there would have been no space remaining for the travelers.It is impossible to conceive of half the things this charming Frenchman wished to convey to the moon.A veritable stock of useless trifles!But Barbicane interfered and refused admission to anything not absolutely needed.Several thermometers, barometers, and telescopes were packed in the instrument case."
"旅客们盼望着在这次旅行中仔细地观察一下月球。为了使研究更方便，他们随身携带着由比尔和马德累尔经过仔细观察、耐心绘制出的月理图。他们希望通过这幅图辨识他们所知的月球的一些物理特质。这幅月理图精确地描绘了月球朝向地球那一面的所有的细节。从月盘东部的多尔弗耳山和莱布尼兹山到北极地区的冷海，所有山川、深谷、火山、高峰、盆地都被绘制了出来，还标有准确的尺寸、相对位置以及名称。","The travelers being desirous of examing the moon carefully during their voyage, in order to facilitate their studies, they took with them Boeer and Moeller’s excellent Mappa Selenographica, a masterpiece of patience and observation, which they hoped would enable them to identify those physical features in the moon, with which they were acquainted.This map reproduced with scrupulous fidelity the smallest details of the lunar surface which faces the earth; the mountains, valleys, craters, peaks, and ridges were all represented, with their exact dimensions, relative positions, and names; from the mountains Doerfel and Leibnitz on the eastern side of the disc, to the Mare frigoris of the North Pole."
"他们还带了三支步枪、三支猎枪和大量的炮弹、子弹以及火药。","They took also three rifles and three fowling-pieces, and a large quantity of balls, shot, and powder."
"“不知道我们会遇到什么，”米歇尔·阿当说，“那里的居民或者动物说不定会反对我们的到访。所以还是要有所准备，防患于未然的。”","“We cannot tell whom we shall have to deal with,” said Michel Ardan.“Men or beasts may possibly object to our visit.It is only wise to take all precautions.”"
"他们携带的防身武器有手镐、撬棍、手锯和其他一些有用的工具，当然也带了适合在各种温度下穿的衣服，从极地到赤道都考虑到了。","These defensive weapons were accompanied by pickaxes, crowbars, saws, and other useful implements, not to mention clothing adapted to every temperature, from that of polar regions to that of the torrid zone."
"阿当还想带一些动物出征，不过不是每种动物都选一对，因为他认为没必要让蛇、虎、鳄鱼或其他有害的动物去适应月球环境。“不管怎么说，”他对巴比康说，“带一些实用的动物，比如小公牛、母牛、马、驴等，它们能适应旅行，也对我们有用。”","Ardan wished to convey a number of animals of different sorts, not indeed a pair of every known species, as he could not see the necessity of acclimatizing serpents, tigers, alligators, or any other noxious beasts in the moon.“Nevertheless,” he said to Barbicane, “some valuable and useful beasts, bullocks, cows, horses, and donkeys, would bear the journey very well, and would also be very useful to us.”"
"“我亲爱的阿当，我认为，”主席说，“我们的炮弹车厢毕竟不是诺亚方舟，它既容纳不下那么多东西，也不是用来挽救生灵的。所以，我们只带能带的东西。”","“I dare say, my dear Ardan,” replied the president, “but our projectile-vehicle is no Noah’s ark, from which it differs both in dimensions and object.Let us confine ourselves to possibilities.”"
"经过漫长的讨论，最终他们决定带上尼科尔船长的猎狗和一只大纽芬兰犬。几箱种子也在必需品之列。米歇尔·阿当真想带几口袋泥土，准备去月球上播种。最终他带了十二株树苗，仔细地用稻草包好，打算去月球栽种。","After a prolonged discussion, it was agreed that the travelers should restrict themselves to a sporting-dog belonging to Nicholl, and to a large Newfoundland.Several packets of seeds were also included among the necessaries.Michel Ardan, indeed, was anxious to add some sacks full of earth to sow them in; as it was, he took a dozen shrubs carefully wrapped up in straw to plant in the moon."
"重要的粮食供应问题还有待解决。如果月球上十分贫瘠，寸草不生，那么准备好足够的粮食是十分有必要的。巴比康准备得很充分，他带的那些粮食足足够他们食用一年。这些粮食包括腌肉和腌菜，都被水力压缩机压缩到非常小的体积。他们还准备了一些白兰地和足够两个月用的水，因为据天文学家的观测，他们确信月球表面是有水的。至于食物，他们坚信肯定能在月球上找到一些吃的。阿当对这一点毫不质疑。事实上，假如他对此有一丝怀疑的话，就不会计划此次旅行了。","The important question of provisions still remained; it being necessary to provide against the possibility of their finding the moon absolutely barren.Barbicane managed so successfully, that he supplied them with sufficient rations for a year.These consisted of preserved meats and vegetables, reduced by strong hydraulic pressure to the smallest possible dimensions.They were also supplied with brandy, and took water enough for two months, being confident, from astronomical observations, that there was no lack of water on the moon’s surface.As to provisions, doubtless the inhabitants of the earth would find nourishment somewhere in the moon.Ardan never questioned this; indeed, had he done so, he would never have undertaken the journey."
"“再说，”有一天，他对同伴们说，“地球上的朋友们也不会彻底抛弃我们的，他们不会忘了我们的。”","“Besides,” he said one day to his friends, “we shall not be completely abandoned by our terrestrial friends; they will take care not to forget us.”"
"“当然不会！”J. T. 马斯顿说。","“No, indeed!” replied J. T. Maston."
"“再没有比这更简单的了，”阿当说,“反正哥伦比亚大炮一直在那里。好了！每当月亮出现在最佳的位置，即从近地点穿过天顶，他们都可以用大炮给我们送一次粮食，也就是说大约每年一次。我们只要在约好的那天等着就行了。”","“Nothing would be simpler,” replied Ardan; “the Columbiad will be always there.Well! whenever the moon is in a favorable condition as to the zenith, if not to the perigee, that is to say about once a year, could you not send us a shell packed with provisions, which we might expect on some appointed day?”"
"“太棒了！太棒了！”J. T. 马斯顿欢呼道，“多么聪明的朋友啊！多么绝妙的主意啊！真的，我的朋友们，我们绝对不会忘记你们的！”","“Hurrah! hurrah!” cried J. T. Matson; “what an ingenious fellow! what a splendid idea!Indeed, my good friends, we shall not forget you!”"
"“我就完全拜托你们了！你们看，这样一来，我们还可以定时收到一些地球传来的新消息。假如我们都没想到和地球上的好朋友交流，那我们就太笨了！”","“I shall reckon upon you!Then, you see, we shall receive news regularly from the earth, and we shall indeed be stupid if we hit upon no plan for communicating with our good friends here!”"
"这一番话说得枪炮俱乐部的全体成员欢欣鼓舞。他说得如此简单，如此轻巧，对成功是如此地充满信心，以至于大家都恨不得跟着这三位探险家到月球上去考察。","These words inspired such confidence, that Michel Ardan carried all the Gun Club with him in his enthusiasm.What he said seemed so simple and so easy, so sure of success, that none could be so sordidly attached to this earth as to hesitate to follow the three travelers on their lunar expedition."
"最后，一切准备停当，只剩把炮弹装进哥伦比亚大炮里去了。但这却是一项艰难而又危险的任务。","All being ready at last, it remained to place the projectile in the Columbiad, an operation abundantly accompanied by dangers and difficulties."
"巨大的炮弹被运送到乱石岗的山顶。在那里，几架强有力的起重机抬起它，把它悬在炮口的上空。","The enormous shell was conveyed to the summit of Stones Hill.There, powerful cranes raised it, and held it suspended over the mouth of the cylinder."
"这是个令人惴惴不安的时刻！如果铁链支撑不住这庞大的重量断了怎么办？如果炮弹突然掉下来，势必会把火棉引燃！","It was a fearful moment!What if the chains should break under its enormous weight?The sudden fall of such a body would inevitably cause the gun-cotton to explode!"
"幸运的是，这样的惨剧没有发生。几小时之后，炮弹车厢顺利地进入炮膛，放在了软软的火棉上，这层火棉简直就像一张鸭绒床，只不过会爆炸而已。炮弹的压力除了使哥伦比亚大炮的火药变得更加紧实以外，没有造成其他影响。","Fortunately this did not happen; and some hours later the projectile-vehicle descended gently into the heart of the cannon and rested on its couch of pyroxyle, a veritable bed of explosive eider-down.Its pressure had no result, other than the more effectual ramming down of the charge in the Columbiad."
"“我输了。”上校说，把3,000美金交给巴比康主席。","“I have lost,” said the captain, who forthwith paid President Barbicane the sum of three thousand dollars."
"巴比康不想接受同伴的钱，但由于尼科尔极力坚持，一定要在离开地球之前履行自己所有的承诺，他最后还是接受了。","Barbicane did not wish to accept the money from one of his fellow-travelers, but gave way at last before the determination of Nicholl, who wished before leaving the earth to fulfill all his engagements."
"“现在，”米歇尔·阿当说，“我对你还有一个期望，我英勇的上校。”","“Now,” said Michel Ardan, “I have only one thing more to wish for you, my brave captain.”"
"“什么期望？”尼科尔问。","“What is that?” asked Nicholl."
"“我希望你把另外的两份赌注也输掉！这样，我们的旅行就肯定能成行。”","“It is that you may lose your two other bets!Then we shall be sure not to be stopped on our journey!”"
"第二十六章 开炮！","CHAPTER XXVI FIRE!"
"12月21日终于来临了！这是一个成败攸关的日子！因为如果炮弹没有在晚上10点48分10秒准时发射出去，那么，就要再等上18年，才能等到月球再次从近地点穿过天顶。","The first of December had arrived! the fatal day! for, if the projectile were not discharged that very night at 10h. 48m. 40s. P.M., more than eighteen years must roll by before the moon would again present herself under the same conditions of zenith and perigee."
"天气很好。虽然已接近冬季，但阳光还是很明媚。这三位即将离开家园飞向新世界的地球居民此刻正沐浴在阳光里。","The weather was magnificent.Despite the approach of winter, the sun shone brightly, and bathed in its radiant light that earth which three of its denizens were about to abandon for a new world."
"在这个期待已久的日子到来之前，多少人夜不能寐！每一个人的心都激动得砰砰乱跳，不过米歇尔·阿当是个例外。这位冷静的大人物仍像平常一样走来走去，一副公事公办的神情，完全看不出有什么不寻常的大事让他揪心。","How many persons lost their rest on the night which preceded this long-expected day!All hearts beat with disquietude, save only the heart of Michel Ardan.That imperturbable personage came and went with his habitual business-like air, while nothing whatever denoted that any unusual matter preoccupied his mind."
"天刚蒙蒙亮，乱石岗四周一望无际的大草原就被围得水泄不通。每隔15分钟就有一批新的看客乘火车赶来，据《坦帕观察家报》的报道，至少有500万人在这一天踏上了佛罗里达的土地。","After dawn, an innumerable multitude covered the prairie which extends, as far as the eye can reach, round Stones Hill.Every quarter of an hour the railway brought fresh accessions of sightseers; and, according to the statement of the Tampa Town Observer, not less than five millions of spectators thronged the soil of Florida."
"一个月之前，大部分人就开始在栅栏周围安营扎寨，这为后来发展起来的“阿当城”奠定了基础。整个平原上，到处都是板房、木屋、帐篷。这些人来自世界各地，各种语言在这里同时响起。。一切像是回到通天塔时期一样。来自美国社会各个阶层的人都聚集在一起，享受着绝对的平等。银行家、农民、水手、棉花种植者、掮客、商人、船工、治安官接踵而至。路易斯安那的法国移民后裔与印第安纳的农夫称兄道弟，肯塔基和田纳西的绅士，弗吉尼亚清高的名流，大湖区的猎人、半野蛮人，辛辛提那屠夫，都在一起谈天说地。他们有的戴着宽边的白帽，有的戴着巴拿马草帽，穿着蓝棉布长裤和浅色的靴子。他们炫耀着自己的外衣、腰带和领带。每个手指上都戴着戒指，甚至每只耳朵上都戴着耳环，劣质的别针、胸针、小饰物昭显出他们庸俗的品味。女人、孩子、仆人们的衣服也同样是些便宜货。他们分别簇拥在各自的丈夫、父亲或主人身边，这些人在一大家子人的簇拥下，俨然一副部落族长的样子。","For a whole month previously, the mass of these persons had bivouacked round the enclosure, and laid the foundations for a town which was afterward called “Ardan’s Town.” The whole plain was covered with huts, cottages, and tents.Every nation under the sun was represented there; and every language might be heard spoken at the same time.It was a perfect Babel re-enacted.All the various classes of American society were mingled together in terms of absolute equality.Bankers, farmers, sailors, cotton-planters, brokers, merchants, watermen, magistrates, elbowed each other in the most free-and-easy way.Louisiana Creoles fraternized with farmers from Indiana; Kentucky and Tennessee gentlemen and haughty Virginians conversed with trappers and the half-savages of the lakes and butchers from Cincinnati.Broad-brimmed white hats and Panamas, blue-cotton trousers, light-colored stockings, cambric frills, were all here displayed; while upon shirt-fronts, wristbands, and neckties, upon every finger, even upon the very ears, they wore an assortment of rings, shirt-pins, brooches, and trinkets, of which the value only equaled the execrable taste.Women, children, and servants, in equally expensive dress, surrounded their husbands, fathers, or masters, who resembled the patriarchs of tribes in the midst of their immense households."
"吃饭时，所有人都扑向一盘盘美国南方的风味菜肴，如炖青蛙、红烧猴肉、鱼杂烩、半生的负鼠，还有烤浣熊肉，如饿狼扑食一般狂吞大嚼，那架势简直要把佛罗里达的全部食物都吃尽。还有很多酒水饮料同这些难以消化的菜肴搭配。酒吧和小酒馆里摆满各种玻璃杯、大啤酒杯、奇形怪状的酒瓶、研糖用的研钵，还有一捆捆的稻草，到处回荡着人们的叫声和喧闹声。“一杯冰镇薄荷酒。”一个酒保喊道。“来一波尔多桑加里！“又有一个人叫道。”鸡尾酒！“白兰地！”“地道的新品冰镇薄荷酒！”所有这些叫喊声混杂在一起，到处都是令人迷乱的、震耳欲聋的喧哗。","At meal-times all fell to work upon the dishes peculiar to the Southern States, and consumed with an appetite that threatened speedy exhaustion of the victualing powers of Florida, fricasseed frogs, stuffed monkey, fish chowder, underdone ’possum, and raccoon steaks.And as for the liquors which accompanied this indigestible repast!The shouts, the vociferations that resounded through the bars and taverns decorated with glasses, tankards, and bottles of marvelous shape, mortars for pounding sugar, and bundles of straws!“Mint-julep” roars one of the barmen; “Claret sangaree!” shouts another; “Cocktail!” “Brandy-smash!” “Real mint-julep in the new style!” All these cries intermingled produced a bewildering and deafening hubbub."
"但真正到了12月1日那一天，喧闹声却寥寥无几了。没有谁还惦记着吃吃喝喝，下午四点，大批观众甚至没吃午饭就赶来了。在这个激动人心的时刻到来之际，美国人对吃喝玩乐的热情都暂时消退了，这一点真是意义重大。","But on this day, 1st of December, such sounds were rare.No one thought of eating or drinking, and at four P.M. there were vast numbers of spectators who had not even taken their customary lunch!And, a still more significant fact, even the national passion for play seemed quelled for the time under the general excitement of the hour."
"夜幕降临时，焦虑不安的人群中出现了一阵无声的躁动，恰如大灾难到来之前的平静。大家都忐忑不安，心里都七上八下的。每个人都巴不得已经发射完了。","Up till nightfall, a dull, noiseless agitation, such as precedes great catastrophes, ran through the anxious multitude.An indescribable uneasiness pervaded all minds, an indefinable sensation which oppressed the heart.Every one wished it was over."
"但是，在7点左右的时候，沉寂突然被打破了。月亮从天边升起来了。几百万人齐声欢呼，庆祝月亮的出现。月亮准时赴约，四面八方的欢呼声直上青天。晴朗的天空中，月亮幽幽地散发出皎洁的光芒。此时，三位勇敢的旅行家现身了。随着这个信号，人们又开始欢呼起来，而且更热烈了。500万人立刻齐声唱起了美国国歌以及《扬基歌》，激动的歌声雄壮有力，直上云霄。接下来，人群又渐渐恢复了安静。","However, about seven o’clock, the heavy silence was dissipated.The moon rose above the horizon.Millions of hurrahs hailed her appearance.She was punctual to the rendezvous, and shouts of welcome greeted her on all sides, as her pale beams shone gracefully in the clear heavens.At this moment the three intrepid travelers appeared.This was the signal for renewed cries of still greater intensity.Instantly the vast assemblage, as with one accord, struck up the national hymn of the United States, and “Yankee Doodle,” sung by five million of hearty throats, rose like a roaring tempest to the farthest limits of the atmosphere.Then a profound silence reigned throughout the crowd."
"这时，那位法国人和两位美国人走进人群中间的围栏地带。随他们一起进来的，还有枪炮俱乐部的成员和欧洲各个天文机构的代表团。巴比康沉着冷静地下达着他最后的命令。尼科尔双唇紧闭，两手背在背后，迈着坚定、从容的步子。米歇尔·阿当像往常一样轻松，从头到脚一副旅行装扮，脚踩高筒皮靴，斜跨旅行袋，穿着宽大的天鹅绒套装，叼着雪茄，精神饱满，笑容满面，不停地和J. T. 马斯顿开着玩笑。总而言之，直到最后关头，他都是个彻头彻尾的“法国人”(甚至更糟，是个彻头彻尾的“巴黎人”)。","The Frenchman and the two Americans had by this time entered the enclosure reserved in the center of the multitude.They were accompanied by the members of the Gun Club, and by deputations sent from all the European Observatories.Barbicane, cool and collected, was giving his final directions.Nicholl, with compressed lips, his arms crossed behind his back, walked with a firm and measured step.Michel Ardan, always easy, dressed in thorough traveler’s costume, leathern gaiters on his legs, pouch by his side, in loose velvet suit, cigar in mouth, was full of inexhaustible gayety, laughing, joking, playing pranks with J. T. Maston.In one word, he was the thorough “Frenchman” (and worse, a “Parisian”) to the last moment."
"十点整了！他们进入炮弹的时刻终于到了！一些必要的操作，如降下起重机，之后再把哥伦比亚大炮口上方的起重机和脚手架挪走，还需要一些时间。","Ten o’clock struck!The moment had arrived for taking their places in the projectile!The necessary operations for the descent, and the subsequent removal of the cranes and scaffolding that inclined over the mouth of the Columbiad, required a certain period of time."
"巴比康跟负责用电火花开炮的默奇森工程师调了一下计时表，把时间一直精确到十分之一秒。这样一来，炮舱里的三位旅行者就能亲眼看着指针指向他们出发的那一刻。","Barbicane had regulated his chronometer to the tenth part of a second by that of Murchison the engineer, who was charged with the duty of firing the gun by means of an electric spark.Thus the travelers enclosed within the projectile were enabled to follow with their eyes the impassive needle which marked the precise moment of their departure."
"说“再见”的时刻到了！那场面非常感人。连欣喜若狂的米歇尔·阿当也深受触动。J. T. 马斯顿发现自己干涸的眼眶中涌出一滴老泪，这滴眼泪无疑是留给这一时刻的。他的眼泪滴落在了他亲爱的主席的额头上。","The moment had arrived for saying “good-by!” The scene was a touching one.Despite his feverish gayety, even Michel Ardan was touched.J. T. Maston had found in his own dry eyes one ancient tear, which he had doubtless reserved for the occasion.He dropped it on the forehead of his dear president."
"“我就不能一起去吗？”他说，”现在还来得及！“","“Can I not go?” he said, “there is still time!”"
"“不可能的，老伙计！”巴比康说。过了一会儿，三位同行者就进入了炮弹，从里面旋紧了门板的螺丝。哥伦比亚大炮的炮口已经没有任何障碍物，炮筒直指蓝天。","“Impossible, old fellow!” replied Barbicane.A few moments later, the three fellow-travelers had ensconced themselves in the projectile, and screwed down the plate which covered the entrance-aperture.The mouth of the Columbiad, now completely disencumbered, was open entirely to the sky."
"月亮万里无云的晴空中升起，月光盖住了闪烁的繁星。她经过了双子座，一点点接近天顶和地平线中间的地方。可怕的寂静笼罩着现场！地面上一丝风声也没有！也听不到无数参观者的呼吸声！他们的心仿佛都不敢跳动了！所有的眼睛都紧紧地盯着哥伦比亚大炮的巨大炮口。","The moon advanced upward in a heaven of the purest clearness, outshining in her passage the twinkling light of the stars.She passed over the constellation of the Twins, and was now nearing the halfway point between the horizon and the zenith.A terrible silence weighed upon the entire scene!Not a breath of wind upon the earth! not a sound of breathing from the countless chests of the spectators!Their hearts seemed afraid to beat!All eyes were fixed upon the yawning mouth of the Columbiad."
"默奇森的眼睛始终盯着计时秒表。据开炮只剩下四十秒的时间，但每一秒就像一个世纪那么漫长！到了第二十秒，人群突然骚动了一下，因为人们记起炮弹里勇敢的旅行家们也在屏住呼吸倒数计时。人群各处传来几声尖叫。","Murchison followed with his eye the hand of his chronometer.It wanted scarce forty seconds to the moment of departure, but each second seemed to last an age!At the twentieth there was a general shudder, as it occurred to the minds of that vast assemblage that the bold travelers shut up within the projectile were also counting those terrible seconds.Some few cries here and there escaped the crowd."
"“35——！36——！ 37——！ 38——！ 39——！ 40！发射！！！”","“Thirty-five!— thirty-six!— thirty-seven!— thirty-eight!— thirty-nine!— forty! FIRE!!!”"
"默奇森立即用手指按下电池组开关，接通电流，使电火花传到大炮底部。","Instantly Murchison pressed with his finger the key of the electric battery, restored the current of the fluid, and discharged the spark into the breech of the Columbiad."
"一阵可怕的、神秘的爆裂声顷刻响起，这声音是任何已知声音都无法比拟的，甚至包括雷声的轰鸣和火山爆发的怒吼！任何词语都无法形容出这种声音！一条巨大的火蛇从火山口般的大坑中喷薄而出。大地仿佛是被抬了起来，在那一瞬间，一些观众隐约看到炮弹划破长空，带着炽热的蒸汽成功飞向太空！","An appalling unearthly report followed instantly, such as can be compared to nothing whatever known, not even to the roar of thunder, or the blast of volcanic explosions!No words can convey the slightest idea of the terrific sound!An immense spout of fire shot up from the bowels of the earth as from a crater.The earth heaved up, and with great difficulty some few spectators obtained a momentary glimpse of the projectile victoriously cleaving the air in the midst of the fiery vapors!"
"第二十七章 坏天气","CHAPTER XXVII FOUL WEATHER"
"当那座烈焰组成的金字塔直冲云霄之时，整个佛罗里达州都被火光照亮了。一时间，美国的一大片地区从黑夜变成了白昼。这片遮天蔽日的火光，从100英里以外的海上都能看到，不止一个船长在航海日志里记下了这颗巨大流星的出现。","At the moment when that pyramid of fire rose to a prodigious height into the air, the glare of flame lit up the whole of Florida; and for a moment day superseded night over a considerable extent of the country.This immense canopy of fire was perceived at a distance of one hundred miles out at sea, and more than one ship’s captain entered in his log the appearance of this gigantic meteor."
"随着哥伦比亚大炮的发射，一场大地震撼动了大地。佛罗里达的五脏六腑都在颤抖。火药燃烧释放出的气体受热膨胀，以巨大的力量挤压着大气层，形成了一股人造飓风，像水柱一般在空中呼啸而过。","The discharge of the Columbiad was accompanied by a perfect earthquake.Florida was shaken to its very depths.The gases of the powder, expanded by heat, forced back the atmospheric strata with tremendous violence, and this artificial hurricane rushed like a water-spout through the air."
"飓风吹倒了每一位围观的群众！男人、女人,以及孩子，都像暴风雨中的玉米穗一样俯卧在地上。接着便是可怕的骚乱，很多人都因此受了重伤。J. T. 马斯顿不顾别人的劝阻，一直站在人群前面，此时被飓风冲出120英尺远，像炮弹一样飞过同胞们的头顶。30万人短暂失聪，仿佛是被震傻了。","Not a single spectator remained on his feet!Men, women, children, all lay prostrate like ears of corn under a tempest.There ensued a terrible tumult; a large number of persons were seriously injured.J. T. Maston, who, despite all dictates of prudence, had kept in advance of the mass, was pitched back 120 feet, shooting like a projectile over the heads of his fellow-citizens.Three hundred thousand persons remained deaf for a time, and as though struck stupefied."
"第一波反应过去以后，那些受了伤的、聋了的人们立刻回过神，最后，所有人都像苏醒了一般，疯狂地叫喊着。“阿当万岁！巴比康万岁！尼科尔万岁！”欢呼声直入云霄。成千上万的观众使劲仰着脸，借着望远镜和观赛镜向空中寻觅，一门心思找寻着炮弹的踪迹，一时间忘却了所有疼痛、所有情绪。可他们只不过是白费力气！炮弹已经看不到了，人们不得不等待来自郎斯峰的电报。剑桥天文台的主席就在落基山坐镇，作为一个技术娴熟、百折不挠的天文学家，一切观测任务都委任给他了。","As soon as the first effects were over, the injured, the deaf, and lastly, the crowd in general, woke up with frenzied cries.“Hurrah for Ardan! Hurrah for Barbicane! Hurrah for Nicholl!” rose to the skies.Thousands of persons, noses in air, armed with telescopes and race-glasses, were questioning space, forgetting all contusions and emotions in the one idea of watching for the projectile.They looked in vain!It was no longer to be seen, and they were obliged to wait for telegrams from Long’s Peak.The director of the Cambridge Observatory was at his post on the Rocky Mountains; and to him, as a skillful and persevering astronomer, all observations had been confided."
"但是一个始料未及的现象却让观众们的耐心受到了极大的考验。","But an unforeseen phenomenon came in to subject the public impatience to a severe trial."
"天空刚才还是万里无云，明月高照，霎时间却变得乌云密布。要不是大气层受到了巨大冲力，又吸收了200,000磅火棉燃烧而产生的大量水蒸汽，天空是不会变成这样的！","The weather, hitherto so fine, suddenly changed; the sky became heavy with clouds.It could not have been otherwise after the terrible derangement of the atmospheric strata, and the dispersion of the enormous quantity of vapor arising from the combustion of 200,000 pounds of pyroxyle!"
"翌日清晨，地平线上仍是乌云密布——天地之间形成了一条厚厚的、密不透光的帘幕；很不幸的是，整条落基山山脉都被笼罩在这条帘幕之下。不幸啊！但是，既然人类选择了如此破坏大气层，就必然要接受这一实验所带来的一系列后果。","On the morrow the horizon was covered with clouds—a thick and impenetrable curtain between earth and sky, which unhappily extended as far as the Rocky Mountains.It was a fatality!But since man had chosen so to disturb the atmosphere, he was bound to accept the consequences of his experiment."
"三位旅客已经在12月1号上午10点46分40秒出发了，假如现在可以说这个实验成功了，那么他们将在4号午夜0时到达目的地。","Supposing, now, that the experiment had succeeded, the travelers having started on the 1st of December, at 10h. 46m. 40s. P.M., were due on the 4th at 0h. P.M. at their destination."
"所以说，如果到那时还是这样的天气状况，将很难观测到那贝壳般大小的炮弹。因此，他们只能尽可能地耐心等待。","So that up to that time it would have been very difficult after all to have observed, under such conditions, a body so small as the shell.Therefore they waited with what patience they might."
"从12月4号到6号的每一天，美国的天气都差不多如此。欧洲却遇到了好天气，这里的人们把赫歇耳、罗斯、傅科等大型天文望远镜对准了月亮。但这些望远镜的镜头比美国的还是差一些，所以也没有观测出什么可靠的结果。","From the 4th to the 6th of December inclusive, the weather remaining much the same in America, the great European instruments of Herschel, Rosse, and Foucault, were constantly directed toward the moon, for the weather was then magnificent; but the comparative weakness of their glasses prevented any trustworthy observations being made."
"7号，天空似乎要放晴。此时人们满怀希望，但他们的希望马上又破灭了。晚上，浓云又笼罩了苍穹，遮住了满天星斗。","On the 7th the sky seemed to lighten.They were in hopes now, but their hope was of but short duration, and at night again thick clouds hid the starry vault from all eyes."
"事态开始变得严重了，9号，太阳又出现了一小会儿，好像是在故意戏弄美国人。人们嘘声一片，太阳受到这样的待遇，无疑是伤心了，所以才这么吝啬自己的阳光。","Matters were now becoming serious, when on the 9th the sun reappeared for an instant, as if for the purpose of teasing the Americans.It was received with hisses; and wounded, no doubt, by such a reception, showed itself very sparing of its rays."
"10号，依旧毫无起色！J. T. 马斯顿几乎疯掉了。他那用杜仲胶粘好的脑壳本来保持得完好无损，可现在，大家非常担心这位可敬人物的脑壳会碎掉。","On the 10th, no change!J. T. Maston went nearly mad, and great fears were entertained regarding the brain of this worthy individual, which had hitherto been so well preserved within his gutta-percha cranium."
"但是到了11号，一场莫名其妙的、热带地区特有的暴风雨袭击了那片地区。一场猛烈的东风刮走了盘踞多天的黑云。夜里，半面庄严的月轮出现在了闪着柔光的群星之间。","But on the 11th one of those inexplicable tempests peculiar to those intertropical regions was let loose in the atmosphere.A terrific east wind swept away the groups of clouds which had been so long gathering, and at night the semi-disc of the orb of night rode majestically amid the soft constellations of the sky."

"就在那天夜里，一条等待已久、石破天惊的消息，如晴空霹雳撼动了整个美国。这个消息随即漂洋过海，通过地球上的每一条电报线路传播开来。多亏朗斯峰顶上的望远镜，炮弹已经被侦测到了。下面是剑桥天文台主席收到的报告。其中包括对枪炮俱乐部此次实验的科学总结。","That very night, the startling news so impatiently awaited, burst like a thunderbolt over the United States of the Union, and thence, darting across the ocean, ran through all the telegraphic wires of the globe.The projectile had been detected, thanks to the gigantic reflector of Long’s Peak!Here is the note received by the director of the Observatory of Cambridge.It contains the scientific conclusion regarding this great experiment of the Gun Club."
"朗斯峰，12月20日。至剑桥天文台的各位同仁。由乱石岗哥伦比亚大炮发射的炮弹，已经于12月12号晚8点47分月球进入公转最后一个时期后，被贝尔法斯特先生和J. T. 马斯顿先生侦测到了。炮弹并没有到达目的地。它从月球附近经过，但是由于足够接近月球，所以被月球引力所俘获。","LONG’S PEAK, December 12.To the Officers of the Observatory of Cambridge.The projectile discharged by the Columbiad at Stones Hill has been detected by Messrs. Belfast and J. T. Maston, 12th of December, at 8:47 P.M., the moon having entered her last quarter.This projectile has not arrived at its destination.It has passed by the side; but sufficiently near to be retained by the lunar attraction."
"因此，炮弹由直线运动变成高速的环形运动，现在正沿一条椭圆形轨道绕着月亮飞行，变成了一颗真正意义上的卫星。","The rectilinear movement has thus become changed into a circular motion of extreme velocity, and it is now pursuing an elliptical orbit round the moon, of which it has become a true satellite."
"我们还无法确定这颗新星的基本运行状况，因为我们尚不清楚它的运行速度。据估计，它和月球表面的距离为2,833英里。","The elements of this new star we have as yet been unable to determine; we do not yet know the velocity of its passage.The distance which separates it from the surface of the moon may be estimated at about 2,833 miles."
"然而，我们考虑了两种假设情况。","However, two hypotheses come here into our consideration."
"1.炮弹要么会在月球引力作用下到达月表，这样，三位旅行者就会到达目的地；","1. Either the attraction of the moon will end by drawing them into itself, and the travelers will attain their destination; or, "
"2.要么遵循不变的法则，在月球引力的作用下，一直绕月飞行，直到毁灭。","2. The projectile, following an immutable law, will continue to gravitate round the moon till the end of time."
"在未来的观测里，我们将找到答案，但在那之前，枪炮俱乐部的实验除了给我们的太阳系添加一颗新星外，尚没有其他成果。J. 贝尔法斯特","At some future time, our observations will be able to determine this point, but till then the experiment of the Gun Club can have no other result than to have provided our solar system with a new star.J. BELFAST."
"这个意料之外的结局引起了多少问题？未来的科学研究里，又将遇到多少不解之谜？无论如何，在人类宇航史上，尼科尔、巴比康、米歇尔·阿当的名字注定是要名垂千古了！","To how many questions did this unexpected denouement give rise?What mysterious results was the future reserving for the investigation of science?At all events, the names of Nicholl, Barbicane, and Michel Ardan were certain to be immortalized in the annals of astronomy!"
"自从朗斯峰的快讯被公之于众，人们心中普遍产生了一种惊奇和恐慌的感觉。还有可能帮助那三位勇敢的旅行家吗？不能！只因他们已经超越了人类的圈子，超越了造物主为地球生灵规定的界限。他们有足够两个月使用的空气，足够一年吃的粮食——可那以后呢？只有一个人不愿意承认目前的局势是令人绝望的——只有他自己还满怀信心，这个人就是他们忠实的朋友J. T. 马斯顿。","When the dispatch from Long’s Peak had once become known, there was but one universal feeling of surprise and alarm.Was it possible to go to the aid of these bold travelers?No! for they had placed themselves beyond the pale of humanity, by crossing the limits imposed by the Creator on his earthly creatures.They had air enough for two months; they had victuals enough for twelve;—but after that?There was only one man who would not admit that the situation was desperate—he alone had confidence; and that was their devoted friend J. T. Maston."
"而且，他还一刻不离地观测着他们。朗斯峰观测站从此成了他的家，那架巨大的望远镜也成了他的全部世界。只要月亮一从地平线升起，他就马上透过望远镜盯着它；他一刻也不让它从视线中消失，孜孜不倦地望着它在星空里穿行。凭借着不知疲倦的耐心，他日夜望着炮弹绕着银色月盘飞行。他真是一个可敬的人，一直以这种方式和他的朋友们保持着交流，并且希望能在未来的某一天重新看到他们。","Besides, he never let them get out of sight.His home was henceforth the post at Long’s Peak; his horizon, the mirror of that immense reflector.As soon as the moon rose above the horizon, he immediately caught her in the field of the telescope; he never let her go for an instant out of his sight, and followed her assiduously in her course through the stellar spaces.He watched with untiring patience the passage of the projectile across her silvery disc, and really the worthy man remained in perpetual communication with his three friends, whom he did not despair of seeing again some day."
"“那三个人，”他说，“已经带去了人类全部的艺术、科学和工业资源。有了这些，就能成就任何事情。总有一天，我的朋友们会回来的。”","“Those three men,” said he, “have carried into space all the resources of art, science, and industry.With that, one can do anything; and you will see that, some day, they will come out all right.”"
