"第一章 两位风情女子的定论","CHAPTER I THE LAST WORD OF TWO GREAT COQUETTES"
"七月革命摧毁了众多依附于王室的贵族产业，这一灾难之后，德卡迪央王妃居然聪明地把由自己的挥霍无度造成的家庭破产，统统归因于这次政治事件。亲王把王妃一人留在巴黎，自己随同王室离开了法国，并且永远不会再回来。他们所欠下的债务，即使变卖所有的家当也无法偿还，不过这只是亲王本人的责任。他既然离家出走，王妃便不会受到法律的追究。世袭的财产已经被扣押。简而言之，这个大家庭的处境也就和波旁王朝长房其他家庭的处境一样糟糕。","After the disasters of the revolution of July, which destroyed so many aristocratic fortunes dependent on the court, Madame la Princesse de Cadignan was clever enough to attribute to political events the total ruin she had caused by her own extravagance.The prince left France with the royal family, and never returned to it, leaving the princess in Paris, protected by the fact of his absence; for their debts, which the sale of all their salable property had not been able to extinguish, could only be recovered through him.The revenues of the entailed estates had been seized.In short, the affairs of this great family were in as bad a state as those of the elder branch of the Bourbons."
"这位往日以德摩弗里纽斯公爵夫人的头衔闻名的女人，非常明智地选择隐退的生活，如果可能的话，她希望自己被大众遗忘。巴黎当时正经受着一股令人晕眩的革命浪潮冲击，曾经的德摩弗里纽斯公爵夫人这一称呼便被德卡迪央王妃这一称呼取代。七月革命中登上社会舞台的大部分新社会的演员都对改名换姓这件事一无所知，因此，王妃在自己生活的城市里竟然成了一位陌生人物。","This woman, so celebrated under her first name of Duchesse de Maufrigneuse, very wisely decided to live in retirement, and to make herself, if possible, forgotten.Paris was then so carried away by the whirling current of events that the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse, buried in the Princesse de Cadignan, a change of name unknown to most of the new actors brought upon the stage of society by the revolution of July, did really become a stranger in her own city."
"在巴黎，公爵的头衔和其他头衔比起来是最高的，甚至高于亲王；不考虑一切诡辩的说法，按照纹章学理论，头衔没有任何意义，贵族之间是绝对平等的。这种值得赞赏的平等曾一度被法国王室保留下来；现如今，这样的平等仍然存在，至少名义上存在；法国国王仅仅赐予自己的儿子普通的伯爵头衔。","In Paris the title of duke ranks all others, even that of prince; though, in heraldic theory, free of all sophism, titles signify nothing; there is absolute equality among gentlemen.This fine equality was formerly maintained by the House of France itself; and in our day it is so still, at least, nominally; witness the care with which the kings of France give to their sons the simple title of count."
"正是按照这种制度，弗朗索瓦一世在给高傲自大的查理五世的回信中，只签署了“弗朗索瓦，旺弗的领主”这个称呼，以示他对一切显赫头衔的不屑。路易十一做得更好，他把自己的女儿许配给了一个没有头衔的上流人士，名字叫皮埃尔·德博热。在路易十四统治时期，封建体系受到极大破坏，此时，公爵变成了贵族阶级最高且最让人仰慕的头衔。","It was in virtue of this system that Francois crushed the splendid titles assumed by the pompous Charles the Fifth, by signing his answer: “Francois, seigneur de Vanves.”Louis XI. did better still by marrying his daughter to an untitled gentleman, Pierre de Beaujeu.The feudal system was so thoroughly broken up by Louis XIV. that the title of duke became, during his reign, the supreme honor of the aristocracy, and the most coveted."
"尽管如此，在法国还有两三个王族家庭，曾经占有广大的领地，因此其地位仍在公爵之上。例如卡迪央家族，拥有指定由长子继承的德摩弗里纽斯公爵头衔，便是上文所说的几家例外的王族中的一家。像早期罗昂家族的亲王一样，德卡迪央亲王有权利在家中设立王座；还可以有侍从、陪臣为自己服务。这一解释是很有必要的，一方面可以摆脱那些虽然一无所知但对此事进行愚蠢批判的人，另一方面，也可以对一个将要不复存在的社会的各种风俗惯例做个记录。很明显，这个社会，众人对其一无所知，却竞相推倒它。","Nevertheless there are two or three families in France in which the principality, richly endowed in former times, takes precedence of the duchy.The house of Cadignan, which possesses the title of Duc de Maufrigneuse for its eldest sons, is one of these exceptional families.Like the princes of the house of Rohan in earlier days, the princes of Cadignan had the right to a throne in their own domain; they could have pages and gentlemen in their service.This explanation is necessary, as much to escape foolish critics who know nothing, as to record the customs of a world which, we are told, is about to disappear, and which, evidently, so many persons are assisting to push away without knowing what it is."
"卡迪央家族的家徽，设计为五个相互联结的黑色菱形图案，中央贯穿一条横带，其上刻着“Memini”（表示“纪念”，拉丁文）作为箴言。家徽上有封口皇冠，但是既没有支撑物，也没有覆盖物。这段时间以来，大批陌生人涌进巴黎，他们对纹章学几乎一无所知，却开始把亲王这一头衔变得时髦起来。事实上，只有拥有封地和享有殿下称号的人才能算作真正的亲王。法国贵族对亲王头衔的蔑视，以及路易十四把公爵设为最高地位的种种原因，使法国人民无法给予现存的寥寥几个亲王以“殿下”的称号，但拿破仑家族的亲王例外。正是出于这个原因，卡迪央家族的亲王们从名义上来说，是没有欧洲大陆的亲王地位高的。","The Cadignans bear: or, five lozenges sable appointed, placed fess—wise, with the word “Memini” for motto, a crown with a cap of maintenance, no supporters or mantle.In these days the great crowd of strangers flocking to Paris, and the almost universal ignorance of the science of heraldry, are beginning to bring the title of prince into fashion.There are no real princes but those possessed of principalities, to whom belongs the title of highness.The disdain shown by the French nobility for the title of prince, and the reasons which caused Louis XIV. to give supremacy to the title of duke, have prevented Frenchmen from claiming the appellation of “highness” for the few princes who exist in France, those of Napoleon excepted.This is why the princes of Cadignan hold an inferior position, nominally, to the princes of the continent."
"圣日耳曼地区的群众都用满怀崇敬的沉默来保护王妃。首先是出于她那让所有人尊敬的姓氏；其次是出于她的不幸遭遇，这一点人们现在已不再议论了；最后是出于她的美丽，这是她从曾经富裕的生活中唯一保存下来的东西。她曾经为之增光的社会，对她充满感激，因为她现在像是当起了修女，闭门不出，退隐在家中。这一得体的举动，对她而言，比其他女人都更是一种巨大的牺牲。在法国，人们总是能够极其敏锐地感受到高尚的举动。王妃的隐退得到了她在过去荣华富贵中失去的一切声望。","The members of the society called the faubourg Saint-Germain protected the princess by a respectful silence due to her name, which is one of those that all men honor, to her misfortunes, which they ceased to discuss, and to her beauty, the only thing she saved of her departed opulence.Society, of which she had once been the ornament, was thankful to her for having, as it were, taken the veil, and cloistered herself in her own home.This act of good taste was for her, more than for any other woman, an immense sacrifice.Great deeds are always so keenly felt in France that the princess gained, by her retreat, as much as she had lost in public opinion in the days of her splendor."
"现在她只与一位旧友德埃斯巴侯爵夫人有往来。她既不出席节日庆祝场合也不参加聚会。王妃和侯爵夫人总是在上午相互拜访，像是刻意避人耳目。每当王妃去她这位女友家共进晚餐，侯爵夫人便会命人关上大门。德埃斯巴侯爵夫人对待王妃非常友好真诚；她曾把剧院里楼上的包厢退掉，换成了楼下的包厢，这样便于德卡迪央夫人能够悄悄地进入剧院，也能秘密地离开。很少有女人能够这么体贴，因为这样会使她们失去很多乐趣——不能亲眼看着落魄的对手跟在自己屁股后面团团转，也不能使自己在大众面前成为她的恩人。王妃可以享受在剧院的时光，乘坐侯爵夫人的马车到任何地方，她从来不会在白天公开地接受侯爵夫人的马车，只会悄悄地乘坐，这样一来便不必穿着昂贵服装了。没有人知道德埃斯巴侯爵夫人为什么对德卡迪央王妃这么友好；但是她的举动真的很令人钦佩，她这么长时间以来那些一点一滴的付出，如果孤立地看，似乎都是微乎其微的琐事，可是总体来看的话，的确很伟大。","She now saw only one of her old friends, the Marquise d’Espard, and even to her she never went on festive occasions or to parties.The princess and the marquise visited each other in the forenoons, with a certain amount of secrecy.When the princess went to dine with her friend, the marquise closed her doors.Madame d’Espard treated the princess charmingly; she changed her box at the opera, leaving the first tier for a baignoire on the ground-floor, so that Madame de Cadignan could come to the theatre unseen, and depart incognito.Few women would have been capable of a delicacy which deprived them of the pleasure of bearing in their train a fallen rival, and of publicly being her benefactress.Thus relieved of the necessity for costly toilets, the princess could enjoy the theatre, whither she went in Madame d’Espard’s carriage, which she would never have accepted openly in the daytime.No one has ever known Madame d’Espard’s reasons for behaving thus to the Princesse de Cadignan; but her conduct was admirable, and for a long time included a number of little acts which, viewed single, seem mere trifles, but taken in the mass become gigantic."
"到一八三二年为止，三年的时间已经给德摩弗里纽斯公爵夫人的风流韵事和冒险经历蒙上了一层霜雪，把她洗刷得一干二净，现在她必须经过一番努力，才能记起那段生活。","In 1832, three years had thrown a mantle of snow over the follies and adventures of the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse, and had whitened them so thoroughly that it now required a serious effort of memory to recall them."
"这位曾经被众多侍臣崇拜的王后，她的轻佻放纵可以为无数小说提供素材。现在她仍然是一位美妙的漂亮女人，三十六岁的年纪，但完全可以说自己只有三十岁，尽管她的儿子乔治·德摩弗里纽斯公爵已经十八岁了。她的儿子像安提弩斯一样英俊，却如同约伯一般贫穷。人们期望他日后取得伟大成就。他母亲认为首要任务是为他娶一位千金小姐。或许这个愿望就是她和侯爵夫人保持如此亲密关系的秘密，因为侯爵夫人有个在巴黎算得上一流的沙龙，在那里，她可能会在众多女继承人中为乔治挑选一位妻子。王妃认为从现在起到她儿子结婚要有五年的时间——孤独和忧郁的五年时光；因为她明白，为了儿子的美好姻缘能够成功，她必须谨慎行事。","Of the queen once adored by so many courtiers, and whose follies might have given a theme to a variety of novels, there remained a woman still adorably beautiful, thirty-six years of age, but quite justified in calling herself thirty, although she was the mother of Duc Georges de Maufrigneuse, a young man of eighteen, handsome as Antinous, poor as Job, who was expected to obtain great successes, and for whom his mother desired, above all things, to find a rich wife.Perhaps this hope was the secret of the intimacy she still kept up with the marquise, in whose salon, which was one of the first in Paris, she might eventually be able to choose among many heiresses for Georges’ wife.The princess saw five years between the present moment and her son’s marriage,—five solitary and desolate years; for, in order to obtain such a marriage for her son, she knew that her own conduct must be marked in the corner with discretion."
"王妃住在米罗梅尼尔大街的一所小房子里，她以适中的价格租了这所房子的底层。她用自己曾经富丽堂皇的生活遗留下的东西布置了房间。因此在她的住所里，仍然可以感受到贵族夫人的华贵。房子里陈设特别漂亮，这会使她想起从前的豪华生活。在她家的壁炉上，有一幅弥尔贝尔夫人画的查理十世的微型画像，非常精美，下面刻着这样的文字：国王赠送；作为垂饰的是一幅皇后的画像，皇后过去一直对王妃很好。桌子上放着一本价值连城的相册，这是在我们这个吹毛求疵的工业社会里任何一个自命不凡的资产阶级妇女都不敢公开摆出来的东西。这个相册里面有大约三十张画像，都是她非常亲密的朋友，老天完全把他们作为情人馈赠给她。这个数目本身就是一种诽谤；像她的朋友德埃斯巴侯爵夫人所说，如果只有十张的话，则可算作巧妙的流言。画册里面有马克西姆·德特拉伊、德马尔赛、拉斯蒂涅、埃斯格里尼侯爵、蒙特里沃将军、德龙克罗尔侯爵以及阿瞿达-潘托侯爵、加拉蒂奥讷亲王和年轻的德葛朗利厄公爵、德雷托雷公爵、德塞里齐子爵、英俊的吕西安·德吕邦泼雷等人的画像，都是由著名的艺术家用最美艳的线条和笔墨勾勒而成的。现在王妃仅仅接见过他们中的两三个人物，因此，她开玩笑似地称这本书为《过错汇编》。","The princess lived in the rue de Miromesnil, in a small house, of which she occupied the ground-floor at a moderate rent.There she made the most of the relics of her past magnificence.The elegance of the great lady was still redolent about her.She was still surrounded by beautiful things which recalled her former existence.On her chimney-piece was a fine miniature portrait of Charles X., by Madame Mirbel, beneath which were engraved the words, “Given by the King”; and, as a pendant, the portrait of “Madame”, who was always her kind friend.On a table lay an album of costliest price, such as none of the bourgeoises who now lord it in our industrial and fault-finding society would have dared to exhibit.This album contained portraits, about thirty in number, of her intimate friends, whom the world, first and last, had given her as lovers.The number was a calumny; but had rumor said ten, it might have been, as her friend Madame d’Espard remarked, good, sound gossip.The portraits of Maxime de Trailles, de Marsay, Rastignac, the Marquis d’Esgrignon, General Montriveau, the Marquis de Ronquerolles and d’Ajuda-Pinto, Prince Galathionne, the young Ducs de Grandlieu and de Rhetore, the Vicomte de Serizy, and the handsome Lucien de Rubempre, had all been treated with the utmost coquetry of brush and pencil by celebrated artists.As the princess now received only two or three of these personages, she called the book, jokingly, the collection of her errors."
"她所遭遇的不幸倒使她成为了一位好母亲。在王朝复辟的十五年中，她沉浸在自己的快乐中，很少能想到儿子；但是在默默无闻的隐居生活中，这位傲慢且地位显赫的母亲认识到，如果她能把母爱发展到极致，可能那些理智的人会宽恕她从前的过错，因为他们愿意宽恕一位好母亲所有的过错。她更加疼爱自己的儿子，因为她没有其他值得爱的东西了。","Misfortune had made this woman a good mother.During the fifteen years of the Restoration she had amused herself far too much to think of her son; but on taking refuge in obscurity, this illustrious egoist bethought her that the maternal sentiment, developed to its extreme, might be an absolution for her past follies in the eyes of sensible persons, who pardon everything to a good mother.She loved her son all the more because she had nothing else to love."
"何况乔治·德摩弗里纽斯是一个可以使母亲的虚荣心得到满足的孩子，相应地，王妃愿意为他做出各种牺牲。她为儿子租了一个马厩和马车房，楼上小小一层里有三间装饰华丽，面向大街的屋子是他的住所；她甚至节约下钱为儿子买下一匹乘马，一匹拉马，还雇了一个小仆人。至于她自己，仅有一个贴身女仆，做饭的也只留了一个原来的厨娘。因此，公爵的马夫总是有相当繁重的差事。这个名叫托比的马夫，曾经是已故的博德诺的小老虎（这是上流社会对这个落魄青年的一种嘲笑说法）——这个年轻人已经二十五岁了，但人们总认为他只有十四岁。他一个人要照料马匹、擦洗双轮马车或者英国式轻便双轮车、清洗马具、跟随主人出入、照看房子，如果正巧碰到有人来访，他还要站在前厅向王妃通报。","Georges de Maufrigneuse was, moreover, one of those children who flatter the vanities of a mother; and the princess had, accordingly, made all sorts of sacrifices for him.She hired a stable and coach-house, above which he lived in a little entresol with three rooms looking on the street, and charmingly furnished; she had even borne several privations to keep a saddle-horse, a cab-horse, and a little groom for his use.For herself, she had only her own maid, and as cook, a former kitchen—maid.The duke’s groom had, therefore, rather a hard place.Toby, formerly tiger to the “late” Beaudenord (such was the jesting term applied by the gay world to that ruined gentleman),—Toby, who at twenty-five years of age was still considered only fourteen, was expected to groom the horses, clean the cabriolet, or the tilbury, and the harnesses, accompany his master, take care of the apartments, and be in the princess’s antechamber to announce a visitor, if, by chance, she happened to receive one."
"人们时常想起复辟年代漂亮的德摩弗里纽斯公爵夫人——巴黎一位光彩夺目的王后，她奢华的生活可以和伦敦最富有的时髦夫人相提并论——现在她居住在离从前的豪宅仅有几步之遥的米罗梅尼尔街上的简陋房子里，每当人们看到她总是感慨万分。她没有资产把那所豪宅留住，何况投机者已经将它捣毁了。当时这位贵妇有三十个仆人侍候才算勉强满意，拥有巴黎最豪华的接待厅，最漂亮的小套间，在这所豪宅里举行令人愉快的聚会，现在却住在仅仅拥有五个房间的寓所里——一间前厅，一间餐厅、一间客厅、一间卧室、一间更衣室，身边的佣人只剩两个妇女了。","When one thinks of what the beautiful Duchesse de Maufrigneuse had been under the Restoration,—one of the queens of Paris, a dazzling queen, whose luxurious existence equalled that of the richest women of fashion in London,—there was something touching in the sight of her in that humble little abode in the rue de Miromesnil, a few steps away from her splendid mansion, which no amount of fortune had enabled her to keep, and which the hammer of speculators has since demolished.The woman who thought she was scarcely well served by thirty servants, who possessed the most beautiful reception-rooms in all Paris, and the loveliest little private apartments, and who made them the scene of such delightful fetes, now lived in a small apartment of five rooms,—an antechamber, dining-room, salon, one bed-chamber, and a dressing—room, with two women-servants only."
"“啊！她为儿子付出得太多了，”聪明的德埃斯巴侯爵夫人这么说道，“她从没有炫耀过自己的付出；她是幸福的。有谁会相信这么一位轻浮的贵妇会有如此坚持不懈的决心呢！因此，我们善良的大主教鼓励她；他对她非常友好，并且说服德五天鹅老伯爵夫人去拜访她。”","“Ah!she is devoted to her son,” said that clever creature, Madame d’Espard, “and devoted without ostentation; she is happy.Who would ever have believed so frivolous a woman was capable of such persistent resolution!Our good archbishop has, consequently, greatly encouraged her; he is most kind to her, and has just induced the old Comtesse de Cinq-Cygne to pay her a visit.”"
"我们必须承认事实！只有王后才懂得如何退位，如何保持尊严地从一个并非完全丧失的崇高地位上下台。只有那些意识到自己一文不值的人，才会对自己的落魄感到悔恨，奋力挣扎，怨天尤人，希望回到已经一去不复返的过去——这一点他们自己很清楚。她习惯了被奇花异草环绕的生活，美丽的花草更衬托出她本人的妩媚（不把她比作一朵奇葩是不可能的）。如今她被迫放弃了这种生活，明智地选择了一楼的住房，在那里她拥有一个属于自己的漂亮小花园——长满了灌木，草地总是碧绿的，这给她隐退后的安静生活带来了愉悦。她每年大约有一万二千法郎的收入；但是这笔微小的收入还是由两部分拼凑而成。一部分来自年轻公爵的姑母德纳瓦兰老公爵夫人给的补助金，还有一部分是她的母亲德于克赛尔公爵夫人给的，她在国内自己的封地生活，就像其他老公爵夫人那样善于精打细算；和她们比起来，阿巴贡只能算是一个初学者。王妃仍然和她被流放的王族亲戚往来；当夫人策划在“旺代”地区发动政变时，那位曾经替我们征服非洲的元帅就是在王妃家里和一些正统派的主要领导举行会议——因为王妃已经默默无闻，身处困境，行动几乎不会引起政府的注意。","Let us admit a truth!One must be a queen to know how to abdicate, and to descend with dignity from a lofty position which is never wholly lost.Those only who have an inner consciousness of being nothing in themselves, show regrets in falling, or struggle, murmuring, to return to a past which can never return,—a fact of which they themselves are well aware.Compelled to do without the choice exotics in the midst of which she had lived, and which set off so charmingly her whole being (for it is impossible not to compare her to a flower), the princess had wisely chosen a ground-floor apartment; there she enjoyed a pretty little garden which belonged to it,—a garden full of shrubs, and an always verdant turf, which brightened her peaceful retreat.She had about twelve thousand francs a year; but that modest income was partly made up of an annual stipend sent her by the old Duchesse de Navarreins, paternal aunt of the young duke, and another stipend given by her mother, the Duchesse d’Uxelles, who was living on her estate in the country, where she economized as old duchesses alone know how to economize; for Harpagon is a mere novice compared to them.The princess still retained some of her past relations with the exiled royal family; and it was in her house that the marshal to whom we owe the conquest of Africa had conferences, at the time of “Madame’s” attempt in La Vendee, with the principal leaders of legitimist opinion,—so great was the obscurity in which the princess lived, and so little distrust did the government feel for her in her present distress."
"眼看自己就要四十岁了，这是很可怕的时刻，将会面临爱情破产，对于一个女人来说，过了四十，就没有什么大作为了，王妃因此沉浸在了哲学的国度里。她开始读书，十六年来对于严肃的事情她总是充满热情而又心怀畏惧。今天，文学和政治在女性心目中取代了曾经的宗教信仰，成为了女性虚荣心最后的避难所。在她以后的社交圈子中，人们纷纷传说迪亚娜正在写书。自从她由一位美丽的王后变为智慧女性以来，王妃竟设法使在她的小房子中受到接见成为了一项崇高的荣誉，使受到她接见的人显赫一时。正是在这些活动的遮掩下，她蒙骗了一位她早期的追求者，德马尔赛，他是在一八三零年七月建立的资产阶级政权中最有影响力的人物。她有时候在晚上接见他，占据着他的注意力，这时候元帅和几个正统派人物正在她的卧室里密谈恢复政权的事情。恢复政权的事只能通过集思广益才能成功——这是所有阴谋家往往忽视的一个成功因素。她这样诱骗首相，并且把他作为屏风来掩盖反抗他自己政府的阴谋，这是一位貌美女性的精明复仇手段。","Beholding the approach of that terrible fortieth year, the bankruptcy of love, beyond which there is so little for a woman as woman, the princess had flung herself into the kingdom of philosophy.She took to reading, she who for sixteen years had felt a cordial horror for serious things.Literature and politics are today what piety and devotion once were to her sex,—the last refuge of their feminine pretensions.In her late social circle it was said that Diane was writing a book.Since her transformation from a queen and beauty to a woman of intellect, the princess had contrived to make a reception in her little house a great honor which distinguished the favored person.Sheltered by her supposed occupation, she was able to deceive one of her former adorers, de Marsay, the most influential personage of the political bourgeoisie brought to the fore in July 1830.She received him sometimes in the evenings, and, occupied his attention while the marshal and a few legitimists were talking, in a low voice, in her bedroom, about the recovery of power, which could be attained only by a general cooperation of ideas,—the one element of success which all conspirators overlook.It was the clever vengeance of the pretty woman, who thus inveigled the prime minister, and made him act as screen for a conspiracy against his own government."
"王妃写了一封言辞巧妙的信，向夫人汇报了协商的事情，这次冒险可与投石党运动相媲美。德摩弗里纽斯公爵去了旺代，成功地秘密返回而未受牵连，但是他与夫人的危险事业脱不了干系；然而当夫人发现事业垮掉的时候，就将其打发回家了。如果他留下来的话，这个年轻人的高度警惕性也许会挫败那次背叛。不管在资产阶级眼中德摩弗里纽斯公爵夫人的过错多么大，可是由于她儿子的这次表现，在贵族眼里，那些过错一定被抹杀了。拿自己的独子，同时又是一个有光荣历史的贵族家庭的继承人去冒险，这一行为是非常高尚和伟大的。据说有人故意用对社会的贡献来掩饰私生活中的过错，反之亦然；但是德卡迪央王妃并没有如此想过。也许在许多这样做的人当中，像她这样的并不多见。生活中总是有这样的事情。","This adventure, worthy of the finest days of the Fronde, was the text of a very witty letter, in which the princess rendered to “Madame” an account of the negotiations.The Duc de Maufrigneuse went to La Vendee, and was able to return secretly without being compromised, but not without taking part in “Madame’s” perils; the latter, however, sent him home the moment she saw that her cause was lost.Perhaps, had he remained, the eager vigilance of the young man might have foiled that treachery.However great the faults of the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse may have seemed in the eyes of the bourgeoisie, the behavior of her son on this occasion certainly effaced them in the eyes of the aristocracy.There was great nobility and grandeur in thus risking her only son, and the heir of an historic name.Some persons are said to intentionally cover the faults of their private life by public services, and vice versa; but the Princesse de Cadignan made no such calculation.Possibly those who apparently so conduct themselves make none.Events count for much in such cases."
"一八三三年五月，在最初那些好天气中的某一天下午两点半左右，德埃斯巴侯爵夫人和王妃来回散步——不能说是散步——她们在园子里草坪边的唯一小道上兜着圈子，太阳即将落下。从墙上反射过来的光线，给充盈着花香的小小空间带来了温暖的气氛，鲜花是侯爵夫人送来的礼物。","On one of the first fine days in the month of May, 1833, the Marquise d’Espard and the princess were turning about—one could hardly call it walking—in the single path which wound round the grass-plat in the garden, about half-past two in the afternoon, just as the sun was leaving it.The rays reflected on the walls gave a warm atmosphere to the little space, which was fragrant with flowers, the gift of the marquise."
"“我们不久会失去德马尔赛。”侯爵夫人说道，“你为儿子积累财富的希望也会随之破灭。自从你巧妙地玩弄了这位精明的政治家，他又萌生了对你的爱恋。”","“We shall soon lose de Marsay,” said the marquise; “and with him will disappear your last hope of fortune for your son.Ever since you played him that clever trick, he has returned to his affection for you.”"
"“我儿子绝不会向幼支投降，”王妃回应道，“哪怕他要被饿死，哪怕我得出去工作养活他。况且，贝尔特·德五天鹅并不讨厌他。”","“My son will never capitulate to the younger branch,” returned the princess, “if he has to die of hunger, or I have to work with my hands to feed him.Besides, Berthe de Cinq-Cygne has no aversion to him.”"
"“孩子们是不会受他们父母所受的束缚的。”德埃斯巴夫人说。","“Children don’t bind themselves to their parents’ principles,” said Madame d’Espard."
"“咱们别谈论这件事情了。”王妃说道，“如果我讨好不了德五天鹅侯爵夫人，我就让乔治和一个铁匠的女儿结婚，就像小德埃斯格里尼做的那样。”","“Don’t let us talk about it,” said the princess.“If I can’t coax over the Marquise de Cinq-Cygne, I shall marry Georges to the daughter of some iron-founderer, as that little d’Esgrignon did.”"
"“你爱过他吗？”侯爵夫人问道。","“Did you love Victurnien?” asked the marquise."
"“没有。”王妃坚定地说道，“德埃斯格里尼的天真单纯简直和乡下人的愚蠢一样，这一点我发现得太晚了——也可以说太早了。”","“No,” replied the princess, gravely, “d’Esgrignon’s simplicity was really only a sort of provincial silliness, which I perceived rather too late—or, if you choose, too soon.”"
"“那德马尔赛呢？”","“And de Marsay?”"
"“德马尔赛把我当成了一个玩偶。那时候我是多么年轻啊！我们从来不爱那种摆出说教架势的人；他们会伤害我们所有小小的虚荣心。”","“De Marsay played with me as if I were a doll.I was so young at the time!We never love men who pretend to teach us; they rub up all our little vanities.”"
"“那位上吊自尽的可怜男孩呢？”","“And that wretched boy who hanged himself?”"
"“吕西安？他像安提弩斯一样英俊潇洒，并且还是一位诗人。我从心底里崇拜他，我本来可以幸福的。但是他爱上了一个妓女；所以我把他让给了德塞里奇夫人。","“Lucien?An Antinous and a great poet.I worshiped him in all conscience, and I might have been happy.But he was in love with a girl of the town; and I gave him up to Madame de Serizy."
"如果他真的爱我，我会那么放弃他吗？”","If he had cared to love me, should I have given him up?”"
"“太奇怪了，你竟然遇上一位以斯贴！”","“What an odd thing, that you should come into collision with an Esther!”"
"“她比我漂亮。”王妃说道，“我已经在孤独中生活了快三年。”停了一会儿她接着说：“但这段宁静的生活没有让我感到一丝痛苦。只有对你，我才敢说，我生活得很幸福。对于别人对我的爱慕我已经麻木了，对于享乐也感到厌倦了，表面上情感丰富，实则清醒地意识到真正的情感从来没有抵达过内心深处。我发现我所认识的那些男人都是小气的、卑鄙的、肤浅的家伙；没有一个人使我产生过一点惊喜；他们缺乏纯真的品质，丧失了伟大的情操，也没有细腻的情感。我希望能够碰上一个让我尊重的男人。”","“She was handsomer than I,” said the Princess.—“Very soon it shall be three years that I have lived in solitude,” she resumed, after a pause, “and this tranquillity has nothing painful to me about it.To you alone can I dare to say that I feel I am happy.I was surfeited with adoration, weary of pleasure, emotional on the surface of things, but conscious that emotion itself never reached my heart.I have found all the men whom I have known petty, paltry, superficial; none of them ever caused me a surprise; they had no innocence, no grandeur, no delicacy.I wish I could have met with one man able to inspire me with respect.”"
"“亲爱的，难道你和我一样吗？”侯爵夫人问道，“当你打算去爱一个人的时候，你没有感受到爱情吗？”","“Then are you like me, my dear?” asked the marquise; “have you never felt the emotion of love while trying to love?”"
"“从来没有过。”王妃把手放在朋友的胳臂上，回答道。","“Never,” replied the princess, laying her hand on the arm of her friend."
"她们转过身，坐在竞相开放的茉莉花下一张粗糙的长椅上。她们互相倾诉了一些对这个年纪的女人来说很庄严的话。","They turned and seated themselves on a rustic bench beneath a jasmine then coming into flower.Each had uttered one of those sayings that are solemn to women who have reached their age."
"“就像你一样，”王妃说道，“与其他的女人相比，我得到更多的爱，但是在我所有的风流韵事中，我没有感到过幸福。我做过很多愚蠢的事情，可是那时我总有一个目标，我越是要接近它，它却离我越来越远。今天，在我已经衰老的内心，涌动着一种从来未被触及的纯洁。是的，在无数的经历下面保存着一种完整无缺的、最初的爱——就像我自己一样，尽管我失去了很多，疲惫不堪，但还是感觉自己年轻漂亮。我们可能爱过但是不幸福；我们也可能幸福着却从没有爱过；可是爱与幸福，如果把这两个伟大的经历结合起来，将是一个奇迹。那个奇迹没有发生在我身上。”","“Like you,” resumed the princess, “I have received more love than most women; but through all my many adventures, I have never found happiness.I committed great follies, but they had an object, and that object retreated as fast as I approached it.I feel today in my heart, old as it is, an innocence which has never been touched.Yes, under all my experience, lies a first love intact,—just as I myself, in spite of all my losses and fatigues, feel young and beautiful.We may love and not be happy; we may be happy and never love; but to love and be happy, to unite those two immense human experiences, is a miracle.That miracle has not taken place for me.”"
"“也没有发生在我身上。”德埃斯巴侯爵夫人说道。","“Nor for me,” said Madame d’Espard."
"“隐退后，我被一种难堪的悔恨折磨着：我一生都在玩乐，可是我从来没有爱过。”","“I own I am pursued in this retreat by dreadful regret: I have amused myself all through life, but I have never loved.”"
"“这是一个多么难以置信的秘密啊！”侯爵夫人惊叹道。","“What an incredible secret!” cried the marquise."
"“啊！亲爱的，”王妃回答道，“这样的秘密也就是在我俩之间说说，在巴黎没有人会信以为真。”","“Ah!my dear,” replied the princess, “such secrets we can tell to ourselves, you and I, but nobody in Paris would believe us.”"
"侯爵夫人说：“再说，要不是我们都过了三十六岁的年纪，可能还不会相互诉说秘密。”","“And,” said the marquise, “if we were not both over thirty-six years of age, perhaps we would not tell them to each other.”"
"“是的，当女人年轻的时候，总是怀着愚蠢的虚荣心。”王妃回答道。“我们像那些可怜的年轻人，手里玩弄着牙签，假装已经吃过一顿丰盛的晚餐。”","“Yes; when women are young they have so many stupid conceits,” replied the princess.“We are like those poor young men who play with a toothpick to pretend they have dined.”"
"“无论如何，我们走到了现在！”德埃斯巴侯爵夫人妩媚地说道，同时做了一个迷人姿态，仿佛什么都懂，但又显得很无辜，“在我看来，我们似乎还有足够的活力，在情场上进行报复。”","“Well, at any rate, here we are!” said Madame d’Espard, with coquettish grace, and a charming gesture of well-informed innocence; “and, it seems to me, sufficiently alive to think of taking our revenge.”"
"“前几天当你告诉我贝娅特丽克斯和孔蒂一起私奔了，我想了一整夜。”王妃停了一会儿说道，“我想，她放弃自己的地位、未来，永远离开社交界，必定是觉得幸福才这么做的。”","“When you told me, the other day, that Beatrix had gone off with Conti, I thought of it all night long,” said the princess, after a pause.“I suppose there was happiness in sacrificing her position, her future, and renouncing society forever.”"
"“她有点傻。”德埃斯巴侯爵夫人面色沉重地说道，“德图西小姐为摆脱了孔蒂感到高兴。贝娅特丽克斯没有意识到，一个上流社会的女人没花一分一秒捍卫属于自己的财产地位，这种屈服证明了孔蒂的无能。”","“She was a little fool,” said Madame d’Espard, gravely.“Mademoiselle des Touches was delighted to get rid of Conti.Beatrix never perceived how that surrender, made by a superior woman who never for a moment defended her claims, proved Conti’s nothingness.”"
"“那么你觉得她不会幸福吗？”","“Then you think she will be unhappy?”"
"“现在她就不幸福。”德埃斯巴侯爵夫人回答道。“她为什么离开自己的丈夫呢？这真是一种脆弱的表现啊！”","“She is so now,” replied Madame d’Espard.“Why did she leave her husband?What an acknowledgment of weakness!”"
"“那么，依你看来，德罗什菲德夫人并不是希望在宁静中享受真爱才这么做的？”王妃问道。","“Then you think that Madame de Rochefide was not influenced by the desire to enjoy a true love in peace?” asked the princess."
"“是的；她仅仅是在简单地模仿德鲍塞夫人和德朗热夫人，我不妨这样和你说，如果她们不是处在我们这个庸俗的历史时期，将会变成像历史上拉瓦利埃、迪亚娜·德普瓦蒂埃、和卡布里尔·德埃斯特那样的人物。”","“No; she was simply imitating Madame de Beausant and Madame de Langeais, who, be it said, between you and me, would have been, in a less vulgar period than ours, the La Villiere, the Diane de Poitiers, the Gabrielle d’Estrees of history.”"
"“亲爱的，那就只缺国王了。","“Less the king, my dear."
"啊！我希望我能召回那些女人，问问她们——”","Ah!I wish I could evoke the shades of those women, and ask them—”"
"“可是，”侯爵夫人打断了王妃的话说道，“为什么要询问死去的人呢？我们认识一些在世的女人，她们幸福地生活着。自从德蒙科尔内伯爵夫人嫁给了小埃弥尔·布隆代之后，我已经就这个话题和她谈过二十多次了，布隆代使她成为了世界上最幸福的女人。他们从来没有不忠的行为，也没有过相互隐瞒的想法，他们如今和刚结婚时一样相爱。这种长期的亲密关系，正像德拉斯蒂涅和纽沁根夫人，以及你的表妹德康夫人和她的奥克塔夫的关系一样，都有一个不为你我所知的秘密，亲爱的。世人极力恭维我们，把我们比做摄政王朝宫廷里的放荡女人，可事实上，我们像女学生一样纯洁。”“要是有那么纯洁就好了，”王妃又哭又笑，“实际上我们的处境更糟糕，真是太丢人了。唉，我们为我们毫无结果的追求赎罪，这是一种耻辱。是的，亲爱的，一切都毫无结果，因为我们不可能在秋天找到我们在春天和夏天错过的芬芳的花朵。”经过片刻沉思，侯爵夫人说：“问题不在这里。虽然我们还都很漂亮，还能激起别人的爱慕之情，但我们无法让任何人相信我们的纯洁和美德。”“如果这是一个谎言，我们很容易用人们的评论装饰它，把它当作美味的水果供给人们，让人们迫不及待地吞掉！可是，我们怎么让人们相信一个真理呢？啊!不知道有多少最伟大的人物都在这上面遭了殃！”王妃补充道，脸上露出意味深长的笑容，这种笑只有列奥纳多·达芬奇的画笔才能描绘出来。“有时候傻人倒挺会恋爱。”侯爵夫人说。“但是这种事，即便是糊涂人，也没那么糊涂，会轻易相信。”王妃说。","“But,” said the marquise, interrupting the princess, “why ask the dead?We know living women who have been happy.I have talked on this very subject a score of times with Madame de Montcornet since she married that little Emile Blondet, who makes her the happiest woman in the world; not an infidelity, not a thought that turns aside from her; they are as happy as they were the first day.These long attachments, like that of Rastignac and Madame de Nucingen, and your cousin, Madame de Camps, for her Octave, have a secret, and that secret you and I don’t know, my dear.The world has paid us the extreme compliment of thinking we are two rakes worthy of the court of the regent; whereas we are, in truth, as innocent as a couple of school-girls.”“I should like that sort of innocence,” cried the princess, laughing; “but ours is worse, and it is very humiliating.Well, it is a mortification we offer up in expiation of our fruitless search; yes, my dear, fruitless, for it isn’t probable we shall find in our autumn season the fine flower we missed in the spring and summer.”“That’s not the question,” resumed the marquise, after a meditative pause.“We are both still beautiful enough to inspire love, but we could never convince any one of our innocence and virtue.”“If it were a lie, how easy to dress it up with commentaries, and serve it as some delicious fruit to be eagerly swallowed!But how is it possible to get a truth believed?Ah! the greatest of men have been mistaken there!” added the princess, with one of those meaning smiles which the pencil of Leonardo da Vinci alone has rendered.“Fools love well, sometimes,” returned the marquise.“But in this case,” said the princess, “fools wouldn’t have enough credulity in their nature.”"
"“你说得没错。”侯爵夫人说，“但我们应该寻找的，既不是傻瓜，也不是有才能的人。要解决我们的问题，我们需要一个天才人物。只有天才才拥有儿童的天真，对爱情像对宗教那样虔诚，并且甘愿被我们绑住双眼。看看卡那利和德肖利厄公爵夫人吧！虽然我们都曾邂逅过那些天才，但那时他们要么离我们太遥远，要么太忙碌，我们也太轻浮，过度沉浸于享乐之中。”","“You are right,” said the marquise.“But what we ought to look for is neither a fool nor even a man of talent.To solve our problem we need a man of genius.Genius alone has the faith of childhood, the religion of love, and willingly allows us to band its eyes.Look at Canalis and the Duchesse de Chaulieu!Though we have both encountered men of genius, they were either too far removed from us or too busy, and we too absorbed, too frivolous.”"
"“啊！在没有尝到真爱的幸福之前，我真不愿离开这个世界。”王妃大声说道。“激起别人的爱慕之情算不了什么，”德埃斯巴夫人说，“问题是要去感受爱情。我看很多女人都只是把爱情当作一种借口，而不曾体会到爱情的前因后果。”“我最近激起的爱情是一种美好而神圣的东西。”王妃说，“它本来是充满希望的。幸运降临到我头上，使我有偶然的机会遇到我们所需要的天才人物。这种机会很难得，因为有姿色的女人要比天才男人多得多。只可惜魔鬼干预了这段姻缘。”“亲爱的，告诉我事情的经过吧。这对我来说真是个新鲜事儿。”“我第一次注意到这美好的爱情，大约是在一八二九年的深冬。每个星期五，我都会在剧院看到一个年轻男人，大约三十岁，坐在乐队前排的座位上。很明显，他是为我而来。他总是坐在同一个座位上，用火热的眼睛注视着我。但或许是由于我们之间的距离太远，又或者他觉得没有希望能接触到我，他看起来总是一副悲伤模样。”“可怜的孩子！人一旦坠入情网就会变得很傻。”侯爵夫人说。“每次幕间休息，他都会悄悄走到走廊上。”被朋友警句式的话语打断后，王妃微微一笑，继续说道，“有一两次，他为了看到我，或者为了让我看到他，就透过我正对面包厢的玻璃窗看我。要是有人来拜访我，我肯定我能在靠近我房门的走廊里看到他，他正鬼鬼祟祟地看着我。显然，他弄清了谁跟我来往。当他看到那些人朝我包厢走来时，他就会紧随其后，想趁房门打开时捞点好处。我也在意大利歌剧院发现了我这位神秘的爱慕者。他坐在我包厢的正对面，天真而又入迷地注视着我——哦！多美好啊！每次离开剧院，我总发现他像是被种在大厅里一样，一动不动。尽管被人挤来挤去，但他还是不动一下。当他看到我靠在某个受宠男性的胳膊上时，他的眼睛就没有那么闪亮了。但他从没跟我说过一句话，也没写过一封信，更没做出过任何表示。你不得不承认，这种品味极高。有时，我晚上回家很晚，就会看到他坐在我家供车马出入的门廊里的一个石柱上。我的这位爱慕者有一双迷人的眼睛，上唇的小胡子和两侧的络腮胡形成又长又浓的扇形胡，我只能看到他白皙的颧骨和给人高贵感的前额，他的头简直就是古代人的头。你知道，在七月暴乱的那些日子里，亲王防守河畔这一带的杜伊勒里宫。那天晚上，他从圣克卢回来，那时局势已经无法扭转。他对我说：‘亲爱的，四点钟的时候我差点被打死。一个暴徒用枪瞄准了我，这时，一个长着长胡子的年轻人，我似乎在意大利歌剧院见过他，正指挥进攻，是他举起那个暴徒的枪口，救了我。’所以说我的爱慕者一定是个共和党人！一八三一年，我搬到了这个小房子里暂住。一天，我发现他背靠着这所房子的墙站着，似乎有点幸灾乐祸的样子，他可能觉得灾难会使我们更为接近。可是自从圣梅丽街垒战以后，我就再也没见过他，他准是在战争中牺牲了。在举行拉马克将军葬礼的前一天晚上，我和儿子出去散步，觉得我那共和党人老是跟踪我，一会在我后面，一会在我前面，从玛德莱娜广场一直跟到全景巷，我到哪里，他就到哪里。”“就这些吗？”侯爵夫人问道。“是的，就这些了。”王妃回答道，“除了圣梅丽教堂被占领的那天早上，一个流浪儿来到我这里，执意要见我。他给了我一封用普通信纸写的信，署名是我的那位共和党人。”“把信给我看看。”侯爵夫人说。“不，亲爱的。在他心中，爱情太伟大、太神圣了，我不能泄露他的秘密。每当我想起这封简短而恐怖的信时，我的心依然无法平静。这个死去的男人比所有得到我青睐的、活着的男人更能引起我情感的波动，他不断地出现在我的脑海里。”“他叫什么名字？”侯爵夫人问。","“Ah! how I wish I might not leave this world without knowing the happiness of true love,” exclaimed the princess.“It is nothing to inspire it,” said Madame d’Espard; “the thing is to feel it.I see many women who are only the pretext for a passion without being both its cause and its effect.”“The last love I inspired was a beautiful and sacred thing,” said the princess.“It had a future in it.Chance had brought me, for once in a way, the man of genius who is due to us, and yet so difficult to obtain; there are more pretty women than men of genius.But the devil interfered with the affair.”“Tell me about it, my dear; this is all news to me.”“I first noticed this beautiful passion about the middle of the winter of 1829.Every Friday, at the opera, I observed a young man, about thirty years of age, in the orchestra stalls, who evidently came there for me.He was always in the same stall, gazing at me with eyes of fire, but, seemingly, saddened by the distance between us, perhaps by the hopelessness of reaching me.”“Poor fellow!When a man loves he becomes eminently stupid,” said the marquise.“Between every act he would slip into the corridor,” continued the princess, smiling at her friend’s epigrammatic remark.“Once or twice, either to see me or to make me see him, he looked through the glass sash of the box exactly opposite to mine.If I received a visit, I was certain to see him in the corridor close to my door, casting a furtive glance upon me.He had apparently learned to know the persons belonging to my circle; and he followed them when he saw them turning in the direction of my box, in order to obtain the benefit of the opening door.I also found my mysterious adorer at the Italian opera—house; there he had a stall directly opposite to my box, where he could gaze at me in naive ecstasy—oh!it was pretty!On leaving either house I always found him planted in the lobby, motionless; he was elbowed and jostled, but he never moved.His eyes grew less brilliant if he saw me on the arm of some favorite.But not a word, not a letter, no demonstration.You must acknowledge that was in good taste.Sometimes, on getting home late at night, I found him sitting upon one of the stone posts of the porte-cochere.This lover of mine had very handsome eyes, a long, thick, fan-shaped beard, with a moustache and side-whiskers; nothing could be seen of his skin but his white cheek-bones, and a noble forehead; it was truly an antique head.The prince, as you know, defended the Tuileries on the riverside, during the July days.He returned to Saint-Cloud that night, when all was lost, and said to me: ‘I came near being killed at four o’clock.I was aimed at by one of the insurgents, when a young man, with a long beard, whom I have often seen at the opera, and who was leading the attack, threw up the man’s gun, and saved me.’So my adorer was evidently a republican!In 1831, after I came to lodge in this house, I found him, one day, leaning with his back against the wall of it; he seemed pleased with my disasters; possibly he may have thought they drew us nearer together.But after the affair of Saint-Merri I saw him no more; he was killed there.The evening before the funeral of General Lamarque, I had gone out on foot with my son, and my republican accompanied us, sometimes behind, sometimes in front, from the Madeleine to the Passage des Panoramas, where I was going.”“Is that all?” asked the marquise.“Yes, all,” replied the princess.“Except that on the morning Saint—Merri was taken, a gamin came here and insisted on seeing me.He gave me a letter, written on common paper, signed by my republican.”“Show it to me,” said the marquise.“No, my dear.Love was too great and too sacred in the heart of that man to let me violate its secrets.The letter, short and terrible, still stirs my soul when I think of it.That dead man gives me more emotions than all the living men I ever coquetted with; he constantly recurs to my mind.”“What was his name?” asked the marquise."
"“哦！一个很普通的名字：米歇尔·克雷斯蒂安。”“还好你把他的名字告诉了我。”德埃斯巴夫人急切地说，“我经常听别人谈起他。米歇尔·克雷斯蒂安是一个杰出人物的密友，你早就想见这个人了，他是德尼埃尔·德阿泰兹，每年都会来我家两三次。这位克雷斯蒂安确实在圣梅丽修道院牺牲了，他生前有许多好友。我曾听说他是像德马尔赛一样出色的政治家：他们需要的是机会，只要时机出现，他们就会成就一切。”“那他还是死去的好。”王妃带着一种忧伤的表情说，这种表情隐藏了她的想法。“你愿意抽一天晚上来我家和德阿泰兹见一面吗？”侯爵夫人说。“这样，你们就可以谈谈死去的亡灵了。”“我很乐意去。”王妃回答说。","“Oh! a very common one: Michel Chrestien.”“You have done well to tell me,” said Madame d’Espard, eagerly.“I have often heard of him.This Michel Chrestien was the intimate friend of a remarkable man you have already expressed a wish to see,—Daniel d’Arthez, who comes to my house some two or three times a year.Chrestien, who was really killed at Saint-Merri, had no lack of friends.I have heard it said that he was one of those born statesmen to whom, like de Marsay, nothing is wanting but opportunity to become all they might be.”“Then he had better be dead,” said the princess, with a melancholy air, under which she concealed her thoughts.“Will you come to my house some evening and meet d’Arthez?” said the marquise.“You can talk of your ghost.”“Yes, I will,” replied the princess."
"第二章 达尼埃尔·德阿泰兹","CHAPTER II DANIEL D’ARTHEZ"
"这次谈话几天后，布隆代和拉斯蒂涅（他们都认识德阿泰兹）答应德帕夫人设法带德阿泰兹到她家赴宴。他们事先说好王妃也会在场，否则这种许诺会显得草率，毕竟对于一个著名的作家而言，同王妃的会面不是那么随便的事。","A few days after this conversation Blondet and Rastignac, who knew d’Arthez, promised Madame d’Espard that they would bring him to dine with her.This promise might have proved rash had it not been for the name of the princess, a meeting with whom was not a matter of indifference to the great writer."
"达尼埃尔·德阿泰兹集高尚的品格和伟大的天才于一身，是我们这一时代少有的人物之一，即便他的作品还没有得到所有人的欢迎，但至少他已得到学术界的尊敬和好评。当然他的声望还会继续升高；但在一些业内人士看来，他已经获得了足够的荣耀。他属于那种最终会得到社会认可的作家，一旦确立地位，就会岿然不动。他虽出身贵族，却一贫如洗，他深深了解他所处的这个时代，只追求个人殊荣。他没有按照他一个富有叔父的意愿行事，而是选择在巴黎这个竞技的大舞台上奋斗。他的叔父在他极度贫困的时候，无情地拒绝援助他，而在他成名后却又突然赠给他一笔财产。这种极为矛盾的做法完全是虚荣心所致。而身份地位的突然转变并未改变达尼埃尔·德阿尔泰兹的生活习惯；他继续像过去一样，简朴地从事着自己的工作，即便是他接受了众议院右翼议员的席位并在那里任职。","Daniel d’Arthez, one of the rare men who, in our day, unite a noble character with great talent, had already obtained, not all the popularity his works deserve, but a respectful esteem to which souls of his own calibre could add nothing.His reputation will certainly increase; but in the eyes of connoisseurs it had already attained its full development.He is one of those authors who, sooner or later, are put in their right place, and never lose it.A poor nobleman, he had understood his epoch well enough to seek personal distinction only.He had struggled long in the Parisian arena, against the wishes of a rich uncle who, by a contradiction which vanity must explain, after leaving his nephew a prey to the utmost penury, bequeathed to the man who had reached celebrity the fortune so pitilessly refused to the unknown writer.This sudden change in his position made no change in Daniel d’Arthez’s habits; he continued to work with a simplicity worthy of the antique past, and even assumed new toils by accepting a seat in the Chamber of Deputies, where he took his seat on the Right."
"他自从名声鹊起之后，有时也出入交际场所。他的一个老朋友，出色的医生奥拉斯·毕安训劝他与拉斯蒂涅男爵结识，此人是议会某部的副秘书长，和德马尔塞首相是好友。这两位政客相当绅士地默许自愿帮助德阿泰兹、毕安训和米歇尔·克雷斯蒂安生前的其他几位好友，将这位共和党人的遗体运到修道院并为他举行体面的葬礼。在当时那个充满暴力的政治环境下，行政处罚极其严酷，在这样的险境下提供这样的帮助实属不易。正是出于感激之情，德阿泰斯和拉斯蒂涅的关系变得密切。这位副国务秘书和德马尔塞如此高明地利用当时的环境；最终他们赢得了米歇尔·克雷斯蒂的几个朋友的信任，这些人起初与德马尔塞的政见并不相同，但这些人现在也都支持新政府。其中一个叫莱昂·吉罗的，先是被任命为行政法院查案主事，最后做到参政院议员。","Since his accession to fame he had sometimes gone into society.One of his old friends, the now-famous physician, Horace Bianchon, persuaded him to make the acquaintance of the Baron de Rastignac, under—secretary of State, and a friend of de Marsay, the prime minister.These two political officials acquiesced, rather nobly, in the strong wish of d’Arthez, Bianchon, and other friends of Michel Chrestien for the removal of the body of that republican to the church of Saint-Merri for the purpose of giving it funeral honors.Gratitude for a service which contrasted with the administrative rigor displayed at a time when political passions were so violent, had bound, so to speak, d’Arthez to Rastignac.The latter and de Marsay were much too clever not to profit by that circumstance; and thus they won over other friends of Michel Chrestien, who did not share his political opinions, and who now attached themselves to the new government.One of them, Leon Giraud, appointed in the first instance master of petitions, became eventually a Councillor of State."
"达尼埃尔·德阿尔泰兹的一生都投入到工作当中；他对社会的了解支离破碎；对他来说社会只是一种虚幻的梦境。他的家像个修道院，在这里他过着本笃会修道士般的生活：有节制地饮食，有规律地工作。他的朋友都知道至今他仍害怕和女人接触，那会令他窒息；他对女人观察得太细致了以至于对其产生了一种恐惧感；结果对女人的研究越深入，越不了解女人——就像那些高深的战略家一样，总会在一些意料不到的阵地被击败，因为此时的实际情况与他们在书上看到的理论不相符或相悖。如今他依然是一个心思纯净的小伙子，却总是摆出观察员的派头来。表面上看，这种对比让人难以接受，但是对于那些善于把握才能和情感之间尺度的人来说，可以解释得通：有才能的人用头脑行事，心思细腻的人则凭借感情。因此一个人可以既邪恶又伟大，就像一个傻瓜同时又是个忠实的情人一样。德阿泰兹就是这样一个幸运儿，他才思敏捷，精力充沛，既拥有坚强的意志，又不乏伟大的感情。他既是实干家，又是思想家，拥有这种罕见的天赋。他的个人生活高尚而丰富。如果他刻意回避爱情，那是因为他有自知之明，他预感爱情的威力会给他带来很大的影响。","The whole existence of Daniel d’Arthez is consecrated to work; he sees society only by snatches; it is to him a sort of dream.His house is a convent, where he leads the life of a Benedictine; the same sobriety of regimen, the same regularity of occupation.His friends knew that up to the present time woman had been to him no more than an always dreaded circumstance; he had observed her too much not to fear her; but by dint of studying her he had ceased to understand her,—like, in this, to those deep strategists who are always beaten on unexpected ground, where their scientific axioms are either modified or contradicted.In character he still remains a simple-hearted child, all the while proving himself an observer of the first rank.This contrast, apparently impossible, is explainable to those who know how to measure the depths which separate faculties from feelings; the former proceed from the head, the latter from the heart.A man can be a great man and a wicked one, just as he can be a fool and a devoted lover.D’Arthez is one of those privileged beings in whom shrewdness of mind and a broad expanse of the qualities of the brain do not exclude either the strength or the grandeur of sentiments.He is, by rare privilege, equally a man of action and a man of thought.His private life is noble and generous.If he carefully avoided love, it was because he knew himself, and felt a premonition of the empire such a passion would exercise upon him."
"数年来，他辛苦地工作，以便为自己接下来的创作打好坚实的基础，加之凄惨的生活，倒成了防止他生活堕落的预防剂。","For several years the crushing toil by which he prepared the solid ground of his subsequent works, and the chill of poverty, were marvellous preservatives."
"但生活渐渐富裕以后，他同一个漂亮的女人有了一段庸俗的、让人最捉摸不透的恋情：这个女人出身下层阶级，没有受过什么教育，也毫无高贵的气质，但却被他小心地呵护着。米歇尔·克雷斯蒂曾承认天才人物能将最普通的女人变成窈窕淑女，使愚笨的女人变成才女，将村妇变成侯爵夫人；越是有成就的女人在他们眼里越是没有价值；因为米歇尔认为天才人物的想象力在这些女人身上发挥不了太大的作用。他认为，爱情之于下等人，只是感官的需要；而之于崇高的灵魂，则是最伟大、最具吸引力的精神创造。为了替德阿泰兹辩解，他还举了拉斐尔和福娜丽娜的例子。其实他本可举自己作为这种理论的一个例子：他曾将德摩弗里纽斯公爵夫人看成一个天使。可以从其他方面来解释德阿泰兹的这种奇怪的幻想：他可能早就感到绝望，认为根本找不到一个符合所有仁人志士所梦想和期待的尘世上的美女；或许是他的心太过敏感、太过细腻，不愿结交一个世俗女子；抑或他认为最好还是顺其自然，继续幻想理想的爱人；或者是他认为爱情与工作无法协调，而且妨碍他的隐士生活而将这件事搁置。","But when ease with his inherited fortune came to him, he formed a vulgar and most incomprehensible connection with a rather handsome woman, belonging to the lower classes, without education or manners, whom he carefully concealed from every eye.Michel Chrestien attributed to men of genius the power of transforming the most massive creatures into sylphs, fools into clever women, peasants into countesses; the more accomplished a woman was, the more she lost her value in their eyes, for, according to Michel, their imagination had the less to do.In his opinion love, a mere matter of the senses to inferior beings, was to great souls the most immense of all moral creations and the most binding.To justify d’Arthez, he instanced the example of Raffaele and the Fornarina.He might have offered himself as an instance for this theory, he who had seen an angel in the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse.This strange fancy of d’Arthez might, however, be explained in other ways; perhaps he had despaired of meeting here below with a woman who answered to that delightful vision which all men of intellect dream of and cherish; perhaps his heart was too sensitive, too delicate, to yield itself to a woman of society; perhaps he thought best to let nature have her way, and keep his illusions by cultivating his ideal; perhaps he had laid aside love as being incompatible with his work and the regularity of a monastic life which love would have wholly upset."
"过去的几个月，布隆代和德拉斯蒂涅经常嘲笑讽刺德阿泰兹，责备他根本不了解这个世界，也不了解女人。他们认为像他这样一个相当有成就、相当多产的人可以享受一下生活了；他拥有丰厚的财产，却还过着学生般的生活；他既不懂得享用金钱，也不懂得享用功名；他既摒弃贵族阶级放纵奢华的生活，也不喜欢贵族出身的女人所向往和体验的美妙的爱情；他不会说一些甜言蜜语，且对浓妆艳抹的女人不断提及的鸡毛蒜皮之事毫无兴致。他或许了解女人；但他对女人的神性一无所知。他应该在巴黎社会中找到适合自己的位置，细细地品味生活的快乐。","For several months past d’Arthez had been subjected to the jests and satire of Blondet and Rastignac, who reproached him with knowing neither the world nor women.According to them, his authorship was sufficiently advanced, and his works numerous enough, to allow him a few distractions; he had a fine fortune, and here he was living like a student; he enjoyed nothing,—neither his money nor his fame; he was ignorant of the exquisite enjoyments of the noble and delicate love which well-born and well-bred women could inspire and feel; he knew nothing of the charming refinements of language, nothing of the proofs of affection incessantly given by refined women to the commonest things.He might, perhaps, know woman; but he knew nothing of the divinity.Why not take his rightful place in the world, and taste the delights of Parisian society?"
"“你家有正面红、金两色斜线分角式，反面镶有珐琅图案的盾形家徽，你为什么不把这个皮卡尔迪古老盾章镶在你的马车上？”拉斯蒂涅喊道，“你每年有三万法郎的收入，外加你的稿费；你也证实了你的箴言：艺术乃德行的宝库（这是一句拉丁文）这句话用了双关的艺术手法，也是我们祖先一直追求的境界，而你从未到布洛涅森林漫游过，却得出这样的箴言，这是值得骄傲的事。我们生活的这个时代需要自己用德行去彰显自己。”","“Why doesn’t a man who bears party per bend gules and or, a bezant and crab counterchanged,” cried Rastignac, “display that ancient escutcheon of Picardy on the panels of a carriage?You have thirty thousand francs a year, and the proceeds of your pen; you have justified your motto: Ars thesaurusque virtus, that punning device our ancestors were always seeking, and yet you never appear in the Bois de Boulogne!We live in times when virtue ought to show itself.”"
"“如果拉弗雷特那样的庸俗女人能够读懂你的作品，能给你带来快乐，你就把她留下，我会原谅你的。”布隆代说，“可是我亲爱的朋友，在物质上来讲，你要是仅仅满足于干面包的话，那么在精神方面你甚至连面包都没有。”","“If you read your works to that species of stout Laforet, whom you seem to fancy, I would forgive you,” said Blondet.“But, my dear fellow, you are living on dry bread, materially speaking; in the matter of intellect you haven’t even bread.”"
"达尼埃尔和他的朋友们之间的这种友好的小征战持续了好几个月，这时德帕夫人请求拉斯蒂涅和布隆代劝说德阿泰兹到她家赴宴，并告诉他们说德卡迪央王妃非常渴望认识这位伟大的人物。一些女人对这类事情的好奇心就像孩子们痴迷魔幻的走马灯一样，只是为了换取眼球的片刻欢愉，却往往流于肤浅，令人失望。一个天才人物越是在远处有名声，那么靠近他时就会越失望；人们越是把他幻想得光芒四射，现实中他就会越显得黯然失色。因此，人一旦失去了好奇心就会常常做出不公正的评价。","This friendly little warfare had been going on for several months between Daniel and his friends, when Madame d’Espard asked Rastignac and Blondet to induce d’Arthez to come and dine with her, telling them that the Princesse de Cadignan had a great desire to see that celebrated man.Such curiosities are to certain women what magic lanterns are to children,—a pleasure to the eyes, but rather shallow and full of disappointments.The more sentiments a man of talent excites at a distance, the less he responds to them on nearer view; the more brilliant fancy has pictured him, the duller he will seem in reality.Consequently, disenchanted curiosity is often unjust."
"不管是布隆代还是拉斯蒂涅都不会欺骗德阿泰兹；但他们笑着告诉他说，现在他们将给他提供一个可以洗涤心灵的绝佳机会，还可以体验来自一位巴黎贵妇所给予的崇高爱情。再说王妃无疑是爱上他了；他没有什么可担心的，只要接受这次邀请他就会赢得一切。他绝不会从德卡迪央夫人为他安置的台座上掉下来的。布隆代和拉斯蒂涅都不认为他们之间的爱情有什么不妥。她过去有许多风流韵事，当然可以经得住轻微的诽谤。于是，两个人开始轮流给德阿泰兹讲述德摩弗里纽斯公爵夫人的风流韵事：最初是和德马尔赛恋爱，第二次和德阿瞿达之间的暧昧行为拆散了他的家庭，并借此向德博桑夫人报复；后来她又和年轻的德埃斯格里尼来往，这个男人陪她到意大利旅行，并为了这个女人使自己声名狼藉；再后来她又和一位出色的大使搞得很不愉快，和一位俄国上将倒是很幸福；还有她怎样成为两位外交部长的顾问等等。德阿泰兹告诉他们他是从可怜的亡友米歇尔·克雷斯蒂安那里得知关于王妃的事，比他们告诉他的还要多，因为克雷斯蒂安暗恋她四年，几乎为她发了疯。","Neither Blondet nor Rastignac could deceive d’Arthez; but they told him, laughing, that they now offered him a most seductive opportunity to polish up his heart and know the supreme fascinations which love conferred on a Parisian great lady.The princess was evidently in love with him; he had nothing to fear but everything to gain by accepting the interview; it was quite impossible he could descend from the pedestal on which madame de Cadignan had placed him.Neither Blondet nor Rastignac saw any impropriety in attributing this love to the princess; she whose past had given rise to so many anecdotes could very well stand that lesser calumny.Together they began to relate to d’Arthez the adventures of the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse: her first affair with de Marsay; her second with d’Ajuda, whom she had, they said, distracted from his wife, thus avenging Madame de Beausant; also her later connection with young d’Esgrignon, who had travelled with her in Italy, and had horribly compromised himself on her account; after that they told him how unhappy she had been with a certain celebrated ambassador, how happy with a Russian general, besides becoming the Egeria of two ministers of Foreign affairs, and various other anecdotes.D’Arthez replied that he knew a great deal more than they could tell him about her through their poor friend, Michel Chrestien, who adored her secretly for four years, and had well-nigh gone mad about her."
"“我经常和他一块去意大利歌剧院。”达尼埃尔说，那时我经常陪着这位朋友在街道上跟着她的马车跑，速度几乎比得上拉车的马，为的是能够透过车窗一睹王妃的芳容。”","“I have often accompanied him,” said Daniel, “to the opera.He would make me run through the streets as far as her horses that he might see the princess through the window of her coupe.”"
"“那么你们就有了一个共同的话题了。”布隆代笑着说，“她才是配得上你的女人；她会亲近你，并且温柔地告诉你如何使自己行为优雅，但是你得当心！她曾经耗尽了许多有钱人的钱财。美丽的迪亚娜是一个十足的挥霍者，她不会让别人为她花一分钱，但却有人愿意为她花成千上百万法郎。你尽管全心全意去爱她吧，但是要守住你的财产，就像吉罗德《洪水》中的老头一样。”","“Well, there you have a topic all ready for you,” said Blondet, smiling.“This is the very woman you need; she’ll initiate you most gracefully into the mysteries of elegance; but take care!she has wasted many fortunes.The beautiful Diane is one of those spendthrifts who don’t cost a penny, but for whom a man spends millions.Give yourself up to her, body and soul, if you choose; but keep your money in your hand, like the old fellow in Girodet’s ‘Deluge.’”"
"这番谈话让人觉得王妃深不可测，既有皇后的万般仪态，又有外交官的腐败，同时又给人一种初识的神秘，又让人觉得她像海上女妖之类的危险人物。这两个聪明人无法预知这场闹剧的结局，但却成功地将迪亚娜·德于克赛尔塑造成一个完美的巴黎贵妇，一个聪明的妖艳女郎，一个最让人着迷的情人。不管怎样，这个被他们视为轻浮的女人，对德阿泰兹来说，仍然是神圣而纯洁的。他急切地想要见到她，所以一开始他就同意接受邀请，而这也是两位朋友想要的结果。","From the tenor of these remarks it was to be inferred that the princess had the depth of a precipice, the grace of a queen, the corruption of diplomatists, the mystery of a first initiation, and the dangerous qualities of a siren.The two clever men of the world, incapable of foreseeing the denouement of their joke, succeeded in presenting Diane d’Uxelles as a consummate specimen of the Parisian woman, the cleverest of coquettes, the most enchanting mistress in the world.Right or wrong, the woman whom they thus treated so lightly was sacred to d’Arthez; his desire to meet her needed no spur; he consented to do so at the first word, which was all the two friends wanted of him."
"德帕夫人一得到消息就去拜访王妃。","Madame d’Espard went to see the princess as soon as she had received this answer."
"“亲爱的，你不觉得自己很漂亮，很迷人吗？”她说。“那么过几天来我家做客吧，我会把德阿泰兹介绍给你。我们的这位天才生性孤僻，最害怕女人，而且从未谈过恋爱。好好计划计划这事吧。他极其聪颖，他的纯朴会打消你的任何怀疑。但他的洞察力属于后发性的，他会后发制人，打乱你的一切计谋。今天你可能蒙骗他，明天就别想让他上你的当了。”","“My dear, do you feel yourself in full beauty and coquetry?” she said.“If so, come and dine with me a few days hence, and I’ll serve up d’Arthez.Our man of genius is by nature, it seems, a savage; he fears women, and has never loved!Make your plans on that.He is all intellect, and so simple that he’ll mislead you into feeling no distrust.But his penetration, which is wholly retrospective, acts later, and frustrates calculation.You may hoodwink him to-day, but to-morrow nothing can dupe him.”"
"“啊！”王妃叫道，“要是我只有三十岁，我就能痛快地和他乐一乐！如今我唯一没有体验的快乐就是玩弄一个聪明的男人。我以前碰到的仅仅是伙伴，从未遇到过对手。爱情本身就是一场游戏而非一场战斗。”","“Ah!” cried the princess, “if I were only thirty years old what amusement I might have with him!The one enjoyment I have lacked up to the present is a man of intellect to fool.I have had only partners, never adversaries.Love was a mere game instead of being a battle.”"
"“亲爱的王妃，你得承认我已经够慷慨的了；你知道毕竟施恩于人……”","“Dear princess, admit that I am very generous; for, after all, you know!—charity begins at home.”"
"两个女人相视而笑，并友好地握了握手。显然她们彼此了解对方的秘密，这种秘密不仅仅与一个男人有关，也不仅仅是一方给另一方提供帮助。因为女人要想使她们之间的友谊持续长久，需要共同使用一些小伎俩才会变得巩固。一旦两个朋友面临冲突，就会拼个你死我活，她们会短兵相接，怒目而视，这种场面是多么惊心动魄，直到其中一位无意中丢掉手中的凶器，才会打破这种可怕的局面。","The two women looked at each other, laughing, and clasped hands in a friendly way.Assuredly they both knew each other’s secrets, and this was not the first man nor the first service that one had given to the other; for sincere and lasting friendships between women of the world need to be cemented by a few little crimes.When two friends are liable to kill each other reciprocally, and see a poisoned dagger in each other’s hand, they present a touching spectacle of harmony, which is never troubled, unless, by chance, one of them is careless enough to drop her weapon."
"一个礼拜后，侯爵夫人在家里举行了小型的节日晚宴，那是专门为亲友们举办的晚会，所有的来宾都只接到口头邀请，在那期间外面的大门总是紧闭着，不接待其他来访者。这天的晚会只有五位客人：艾米尔·布隆代和德蒙科尔内夫人，达尼埃尔·德阿泰兹，拉斯蒂涅以及德卡迪央王妃。算上这位女主人刚好男女对半。","So, eight days later, a little dinner such as are given to intimates by verbal invitation only, during which the doors are closed to all other visitors, took place at Madame d’Espard’s house.Five persons were invited,—Emile Blondet and Madame de Montcornet, Daniel d’Arthez, Rastignac, and the Princesse de Cadignan.Counting the mistress of the house, there were as many men as women."
"德阿泰兹和德卡迪央王妃的会面绝非偶然，而是经过了精心而周全的准备。王妃的穿着打扮依然无人能比，无疑，这对于女人来说是首要的艺术。这次，她穿了一件衬有白色宽大长袖的蓝色敞胸式天鹅绒长袍，带着一条略微褶皱的蓝色镶边网纱围巾，从脖子一直盖到她的肩部，就像人们在拉斐尔的画像中看到的那样。她的女仆给她梳了别出心裁的发式，将几朵白色的石楠花巧妙地嵌入她那卷曲下垂的金发里面，这头金发也是她赢得美人称号的原因之一。","Chance never exerted itself to make wiser preparations than those which opened the way to a meeting between d’Arthez and Madame de Cadignan.The princess is still considered one of the chief authorities on dress, which, to women, is the first of arts.On this occasion she wore a gown of blue velvet with flowing white sleeves, and a tulle guimpe, slightly frilled and edged with blue, covering the shoulders, and rising nearly to the throat, as we see in several of Raffaele’s portraits.Her maid had dressed her hair with white heather, adroitly placed among its blond cascades, which were one of the great beauties to which she owed her celebrity."
"可以肯定地说，迪亚娜看起来超不过二十五岁。四年的独处生活和充分的修养使她重新焕发了青春。而且，当她们渴求快乐的时候，她们的美貌就会增加。这种意愿随着她们脸部表情的变化而变化。如果激动的情绪能够使坏脾气的、易感伤的人那苍白的肤色变黄，使苍白无力的脸变青，那么我们的欲望、希望、快乐就能够使我们容光焕发，眼睛明亮，为美貌更添光彩，使之如同可爱的清晨那样闪闪发光。王妃独有的迷离如今显得成熟，使她更加令人敬畏。此刻，她正在思考着自己经历过的多次坎坷，认真地反省着自己的过去，这使她那高贵而恍惚的眉毛和她那双蓝眼睛发出的缓慢而庄严的神情自然地融合在一起。即使最高明的相学家，也不可能从她那纤细的面部线条看出她内心隐藏的心机和固执。女人善于利用表情来隐藏心计，她们的冷静和娇弱更是误导人们的观察；因此当她们的情欲发挥作用时，要注意观察她们的面部表情，这也许很困难；而此后的观察将无济于事，因为那时女人会慢慢变老，已经无需掩饰自己了。","Certainly Diane did not look to be more than twenty-five years old.Four years of solitude and repose had restored the freshness of her complexion.Besides, there are moments when the desire to please gives an increase of beauty to women.The will is not without influence on the variations of the face.If violent emotions have the power to yellow the white tones of persons of bilious and melancholy temperament, and to green lymphatic faces, shall we not grant to desire, hope, and joy, the faculty of clearing the skin, giving brilliancy to the eye, and brightening the glow of beauty with a light as jocund as that of a lovely morning?The celebrated faintness of the princess had taken on a ripeness which now made her seem more august.At this moment of her life, impressed by her many vicissitudes and by serious reflections, her noble, dreamy brow harmonized delightfully with the slow, majestic glance of her blue eyes.It was impossible for the ablest physiognomist to imagine calculation or self-will beneath that unspeakable delicacy of feature.There were faces of women which deceive knowledge, and mislead observation by their calmness and delicacy; it is necessary to examine such faces when passions speak, and that is difficult, or after they have spoken, which is no longer of any use, for then the woman is old and has ceased to dissimulate."
"王妃就是这样一个让人琢磨不透的女人。她能够随心所欲地扮演任何角色：淘气顽皮、天真无邪的孩子；有时又变得深邃严肃、高深莫测，让人兴奋得有点急躁。她这次来侯爵夫人家，就有心装扮得温柔清纯，让人觉得她是一个被人多次欺骗的女人；一个心地善良却常遭人诽谤、逆来顺受的女人。总之，自己就像一个受伤的天使。","The princess is one of those impenetrable women; she can make herself what she pleases to be: playful, childlike, distractingly innocent; or reflective, serious, and profound enough to excite anxiety.She came to Madame d’Espard’s dinner with the intention of being a gentle, simple woman, to whom life was known only through its deceptions: a woman full of soul, and calumniated, but resigned,—in short, a wounded angel."
"她来得很早，这样就可以挨着德帕夫人坐在壁炉旁边的沙发上，让别人第一眼就看到她：这是一种刻意安排、却掩盖在优美的自然状态下的姿势；一种经过再三琢磨而发现的姿势。这种姿势展示了她那漂亮的身体曲线：从脚踝优雅到胯部，再从圆润凸起的部位过渡到肩部，将整个美丽婀娜的轮廓展现在人们面前。另外，她还有聪明的一手，这是其他女人都不曾想到的，也令侯爵夫人大吃一惊，那就是她带了年轻的儿子陪她赴宴。片刻的沉思之后，德帕夫人警觉地地按了按王妃的手，似乎在说：","She arrived early, so as to pose on a sofa near the fire beside Madame d’Espard, as she wished to be first seen: that is, in one of those attitudes in which science is concealed beneath an exquisite naturalness; a studied attitude, putting in relief the beautiful serpentine outline which, starting from the foot, rises gracefully to the hip, and continues with adorable curves to the shoulder, presenting, in fact, a profile of the whole body.With a subtlety which few women would have dreamed of, Diane, to the great amazement of the marquise, had brought her son with her.After a moment’s reflection, Madame d’Espard pressed the princess’s hand, with a look of intelligence that seemed to say:—"
"“我懂你的心思！刚开始就让德阿泰兹接受一切困难，以后就不用为这些事费神了。”","“I understand you!By making d’Arthez accept all the difficulties at once you will not have to conquer them later.”"
"拉斯蒂涅和达尔阿泰兹一起赶到。王妃没有像其他庸俗的人一样一个劲地恭维这位大作家，她没有说半句恭维话，而是优雅大度地表现出对他的友好和敬重，这已是她做出的最大程度的让步。她对法国国王和亲王们大概也是持这样的态度。她似乎很高兴见到这位大人物，也为追求过他而快乐。像王妃这样有品位的女人之所以与众不同，在于她们聆听的方式，以及谦卑的亲切神态，这样才能显示出礼貌的态度，正如美德要体现在行动上。当这位名人说话的时候，她那种专心聆听的神态比那最动听的恭维话还要使人陶醉一千倍。侯爵夫人以一种既不夸张又恰如其分的方式介绍两人认识。","Rastignac brought d’Arthez.The princess made none of those compliments to the celebrated author with which vulgar persons overwhelmed him; but she treated him with a kindness full of graceful respect, which, with her, was the utmost extent of her concessions.Her manner was doubtless the same with the King of France and the royal princes.She seemed happy to see this great man, and glad that she had sought him.Persons of taste, like the princess, are especially distinguished for their manner of listening, for an affability without superciliousness, which is to politeness what practice is to virtue.When the celebrated man spoke, she took an attentive attitude, a thousand times more flattering than the best—seasoned compliments.The mutual presentation was made quietly, without emphasis, and in perfectly good taste, by the marquise."
"晚宴上，德阿泰兹被安排坐在王妃旁边，王妃并没有模仿一般惯作媚态的女人的节食行为，而是吃的津津有味，显得自然纯朴，也没有任何古怪夸张的行为。上完一道菜后，她利用大家谈话的空当，找机会大方地同德阿泰兹交谈：","At dinner d’Arthez was placed beside the princess, who, far from imitating the eccentricities of diet which many affected women display, ate her dinner with a very good appetite, making it a point of honor to seem a natural woman, without strange ways or fancies.Between two courses she took advantage of the conversation becoming general to say to d’Arthez, in a sort of aside:—"
"“先生，坐在您旁边我感到很荣幸，其秘密在于我想要了解一些您那不幸朋友的事。同我们相比，他为了更崇高的事业而献身。虽然我欠他很大的人情，却不能为此向他感恩或表达谢意。我知道你是他最好的朋友之一。你们之间纯洁而牢不可变的友谊使您有亲近我的权利。我想从您那里得知关于这个您十分亲近的人的一切，我相信您不会对此感到惊讶吧。虽然我出身流浪家族，并且持有保王派政见，但是我并不属于那类认为共和党人就不可能心地高贵的人。专制与共和政体只是政府组织的两种形式，都不能镇压崇高的意念。”","“The secret of the pleasure I take in finding myself beside you, is the desire I feel to learn something of an unfortunate friend of yours, monsieur.He died for another cause greater than ours; but I was under the greatest obligations to him, although unable to acknowledge or thank him for them.I know that you were one of his best friends.Your mutual friendship, pure and unalterable, is a claim upon me.You will not, I am sure, think it extraordinary, that I have wished to know all you could tell me of a man so dear to you.Though I am attached to the exiled family, and bound, of course, to hold monarchical opinions, I am not among those who think it is impossible to be both republican and noble in heart.Monarchy and the republic are two forms of government which do not stifle noble sentiments.”"
"“夫人，米歇尔·克雷斯蒂安是个天使，”达尼埃尔动情地回答，“古代的英雄没人能比得上他的。您可不要把他当作那些一心想要恢复国会和公安委员会设施的心胸狭隘的共和党人。要是那样像就错了，米歇尔希望在整个欧洲实行瑞士的联邦制。我们不妨承认，在我们中间备受推崇的是个人专制体制，我认为这种体制特别适合我们的国家，而米歇尔主张在旧大陆上消灭战争，废除旧的兼并战争所造成的封建割据，建立新的社会体制。从这一点而言，共和党人和他的观点最为接近。这也是他参加七月革命并在圣梅丽修道院被害的原因。虽然政见完全不同，但我们始终紧密地团结在一起。”","“Michel Chrestien was an angel, madame,” replied Daniel, in a voice of emotion.“I don’t know among the heroes of antiquity a greater than he.Be careful not to think him one of those narrow-minded republicans who would like to restore the Convention and the amenities of the Committee of Public Safety.No, Michel dreamed of the Swiss federation applied to all Europe.Let us own, between ourselves, that AFTER the glorious government of one man only, which, as I think, is particularly suited to our nation, Michel’s system would lead to the suppression of war in this old world, and its reconstruction on bases other than those of conquest, which formerly feudalized it.From this point of view the republicans came nearest to his idea.That is why he lent them his arm in July, and was killed at Saint-Merri.Though completely apart in opinion, he and I were closely bound together as friends.”"
"“这番话是对你们两种性格的最好的称赞。”德卡迪央王妃谨慎地说。","“That is noble praise for both natures,” said Madame de Cadignan, timidly."
"“在他生命的最后四年中，”达尼埃尔接着说，“他只对我倾吐了对您的爱情。这种推心置腹的交谈使我们曾经亲密的兄弟之情更加深厚。夫人，唯有他对您的爱才是您应当享有的爱情。很多次，我们冒着瓢泼大雨追赶您的马车，和您的马赛跑，为的是和您的马车保持同步，以便能够看到您，欣赏您的容颜。”","“During the last four years of his life,” continued Daniel, “he made to me alone a confidence of his love for you, and this confidence knitted closer than ever the already strong ties of brotherly affection.He alone, madame, can have loved you as you ought to be loved.Many a time I have been pelted with rain as we accompanied your carriage at the pace of the horses, to keep at a parallel distance, and see you—admire you.”"
"“啊！先生，我怎样才能偿还这些感情呢？”王妃说。","“Ah! monsieur,” said the princess, “how can I repay such feelings!”"
"“要是米歇尔现在在这里该多好呀！”达尼埃尔伤感地叹息道。","“Why is Michel not here!” exclaimed Daniel, in melancholy accents."
"“也许他不应该对我如此痴迷。”王妃摇摇头，伤心地说，“共和党人的思想比我们专制派的思想更严酷，我们的失误在于太过于放纵自己。他无疑把我想象得太完美了，社会迟早会令他发现这一点的。我们女人在生活中所遭受的诽谤恐怕并不亚于你们在创作生涯中所经受的非议；不同的是，哎！我们既不能用自己的作品来自卫，也不能用声誉来保护自己。世人不会相信我们的本真面目，只会相信别人虚构后的假象。不久真相便会被这种假象所蒙蔽，人们会认为那个虚构的女人就是不为人知的现实中的我，这只是世人幻想中的我的虚假画像。那样的话，他也许就会认为我是不值得他为我付出高贵的感情的，而我也不可能了解他。”","“Perhaps he would not have loved me long,” said the princess, shaking her head sadly.“Republicans are more absolute in their ideas than we absolutists, whose fault is indulgence.No doubt he imagined me perfect, and society would have cruelly undeceived him.We are pursued, we women, by as many calumnies as you authors are compelled to endure in your literary life; but we, alas!cannot defend ourselves either by our works or by our fame.The world will not believe us to be what we are, but what it thinks us to be.It would soon have hidden from his eyes the real but unknown woman that is in me, behind the false portrait of the imaginary woman which the world considers true.He would have come to think me unworthy of the noble feelings he had for me, and incapable of comprehending him.”"
"说到这里，王妃动情地摇了摇头，她那漂亮的金色卷发和头上的石南花都随之晃动起来，显得楚楚动人。她那种痛苦的表情所包含的复杂疑虑和内心隐藏的伤痛是难以言表的。达尼埃尔明白这一切；他用关切的眼神看着王妃。","Here the princess shook her head, swaying the beautiful blond curls, full of heather, with a touching gesture.This plaintive expression of grievous doubts and hidden sorrows is indescribable.Daniel understood them all; and he looked at the princess with keen emotion."
"“然而，七月革命过后的一天晚上，我在歌剧院的走廊里又见到他，我差点控制不住自己，想要过去拉住他的手，当着众人的面握住他的手。但是我又想到这样的感激方式或许会引起旁人的误解，就像我过去所做的许多高尚行为，德摩弗里纽斯公爵夫人至今还认为是疯狂的举动。这些事我无法解释清楚，除了我的儿子和上帝无人能够理解我。","“And yet, the night on which I last saw him, after the revolution of July, I was on the point of giving way to the desire I felt to take his hand and press it before all the world, under the peristyle of the opera-house.But the thought came to me that such a proof of gratitude might be misinterpreted; like so many other little things done from noble motives which are called to-day the follies of Madame de Maufrigneuse—things which I can never explain, for none but my son and God have understood me.”"
"她在德阿泰兹的耳边说这些话，以免别的客人听见，她用的是最高明的演员所用的声调，定能打动人的心。而这些话确实让德阿泰兹为之动容。她并不是在讨好这位作家，而是想要借助对死者的悼念来恢复自己的名誉。她可能被诽谤过。显然她想知道自己在这个死去的爱慕者眼中是否始终光鲜照人，他是否死去的时候还对她抱有幻想？","These words, breathed into the ear of the listener, in tones inaudible to the other guests, and with accents worthy of the cleverest actress, were calculated to reach the heart; and they did reach that of d’Arthez.There was no question of himself in the matter; this woman was seeking to rehabilitate herself in favor of the dead.She had been calumniated; and she evidently wanted to know if anything had tarnished her in the eyes of him who had loved her; had he died with all his illusions?"
"“米歇尔是个对爱情绝对专一的人，即使自己选错了对象，他也甘心忍受痛苦，也不会放弃他所选择的爱人。”德阿泰兹回答。","“Michel,” replied d’Arthez, “was one of those men who love absolutely, and who, if they choose ill, can suffer without renouncing the woman they have once elected.”"
"“他就是这样爱我的吗？”王妃带着一种无比幸福的狂喜问道。","“Was I loved thus?” she said, with an air of exalted beatitude."
"“是的，夫人。”","“Yes, madame.”"
"“我使他幸福吗？”","“I made his happiness?”"
"“整整四年。”","“For four years.”"
"“一个女人听到这样的事情，会感到无比骄傲和满足的。”她把甜美高贵的脸转向德阿泰兹，满脸羞愧地说。","“A woman never hears of such a thing without a sentiment of proud satisfaction,” she said, turning her sweet and noble face to d’Arthez with a movement full of modest confusion."
"这类女演员的最高明的手法之一就是即使话说得再过火，她们也能够掩饰自己的态度；当语言不足以达情时，眼睛也可以传达意思。这些巧妙的、不和谐的曲调同她们的爱情乐曲交织在一起，不管是真是假，都会产生不可抗拒的诱惑。","One of the most skilful manoeuvres of these actresses is to veil their manner when words are too expressive, and speak with their eyes when language is restrained.These clever discords, slipped into the music of their love, be it false or true, produce irresistible attractions."
"“不是吗？”她再次压低声音，垂下眼睛，确认自己的言语起到了她想要的效果后，继续说：“能给一个伟大的人物带来幸福，这难道不也是实现了自己的人生价值吗？”","“Is it not,” she said, lowering her voice and her eyes, after feeling well assured they had produced her effect,—“is it not fulfilling one’s destiny to have rendered a great man happy?”"
"“他没有给您写过信吗？”","“Did he not write that to you?”"
"“写过，但我还是想了解得更清楚一点。先生，请相信我，他这么高看我，会不会是自己弄错了。”","“Yes; but I wanted to be sure, quite sure; for, believe me, monsieur, in putting me so high he was not mistaken.”"
"女人往往懂得如何将自己的话赋予特殊的神圣感，她们使话语充满活力，这会使她们的思想意义扩大加深。假如她们的听众为之着迷，可能日后记不清她们说的是什么，那么她们的目的就达到了——这是所有雄辩者的最终目标。今天王妃那金色的头发被盘成宝塔状，其间镶嵌着美丽的石南花，就像戴了一顶漂亮的王冠，即使戴上真正的法国王冠，她也没有今天这样引人注目。她是那样纯朴、安静；她的这种纯净没有任何矫揉造作的迹象，也看不出她任何故作可爱和高雅的意图。德阿泰兹是个脑力劳动者，独处的生活使他对社会的处事方式一无所知，加之研究性的工作又给他裹上了一层保护伞，他当然对这样的语调和言辞信以为真。他完全被这种优美的举止所吸引，他爱慕这位经历不幸、平静度日的十全十美的美人；他崇拜这个集卓越智慧和崇高灵魂于一身的女人。他此刻也希望像米歇尔·克雷斯蒂恩那样爱这个女人。","Women know how to give a peculiar sacredness to their words; they communicate something vibrant to them, which extends the meaning of their ideas, and gives them depth; though later their fascinated listener may not remember precisely what they said, their end has been completely attained,—which is the object of all eloquence.The princess might at that moment have been wearing the diadem of France, and her brow could not have seemed more imposing than it was beneath that crown of golden hair, braided like a coronet, and adorned with heather.She was simple and calm; nothing betrayed a sense of any necessity to appear so, nor any desire to seem grand or loving.D’Arthez, the solitary toiler, to whom the ways of the world were unknown, whom study had wrapped in its protecting veils, was the dupe of her tones and words.He was under the spell of those exquisite manners; he admired that perfect beauty, ripened by misfortune, placid in retirement; he adored the union of so rare a mind and so noble a soul; and he longed to become, himself, the heir of Michel Chrestien."
"这种热情开始出现的时候，像在几乎所有深刻的思想家身上那样，只是一个概念。这会儿他注视着王妃，研究她头部的形状，她那非常柔和的面部轮廓，她的身材以及她那细嫩的双手，这是他和朋友当初在街道上疯狂追逐王妃的马车时无法观察到的。他发现：一个男人内心涌动着爱情时，会出现精神上的第二视觉，这种奇怪的现象此刻就发生在他的身上。爱情的烈火曾经照亮了米歇尔·克雷斯蒂安的眼睛，使他能够清晰地透视这颗心，这样的灵魂！因此，在德阿泰兹看来，王妃是那么有魅力，她的头上环绕着一种诗意的光环。","The beginning of this passion was, as in the case of almost all deep thinkers, an idea.Looking at the princess, studying the shape of her head, the arrangement of those sweet features, her figure, her hand, so finely modelled, closer than when he accompanied his friend in their wild rush through the streets, he was struck by the surprising phenomenon of the moral second-sight which a man exalted by love invariably finds within him.With what lucidity had Michel Chrestien read into that soul, that heart, illumined by the fires of love!Thus the princess acquired, in d’Arthez’s eyes, another charm; a halo of poesy surrounded her."
"晚饭时，达尼埃尔回想起他的共和党朋友向他吐露心声时的绝望心情，以及对爱情充满希望时的种种自信，还有唯独向他朗诵赞美这个女人的感人肺腑的优秀诗篇。一个人从知己的位置变为情敌而不心存懊悔，这种情况是很少见的。而德阿泰兹这样做却并未使自己名誉扫地。他在一瞬间突然发现，跻身上流社会的那些如花的贵妇和出身一般的妇女之间存在着巨大差异，尽管他对后者的了解还仅限于一个样品。因此他终于从他身上最易受影响的地方以及灵魂和天分最敏感之处理解了这一点。他一方面受到自己天真和欲望的驱使，急切想要占有这个女人，另一方面又发现自己受到贵族社会的压制，以及王妃仪态表现出来的威仪所形成的障碍也使他感到压抑。直到上甜点的时候，他们还在谈论米歇尔·克列斯蒂安的问题，这样他们就有合适的理由低声耳语：爱情、同情、悟性等等！对王妃来说，她可以装作一个被误解、被中伤的女人，而对德阿泰兹来讲，他则可以取代死去的共和党人的位置。也许他的率真使他发现自己对死去的朋友少了些许思念。精致的点心在桌上闪闪发光，这些水果和甜食排列得像光彩夺目的篱笆，将宾客们分开；此刻，王妃觉得最好用优雅而简短的谈话结束这场没有间断的密谈。她巧妙地表达了这样一个思想：达尼埃尔和米歇尔是一对精神上的孪生兄弟。","As the dinner proceeded, Daniel called to mind the various confidences of his friend, his despair, his hopes, the noble poems of a true sentiment sung to his ear alone, in honor of this woman.It is rare that a man passes without remorse from the position of confidant to that of rival, and d’Arthez was free to do so without dishonor.He had suddenly, in a moment, perceived the enormous differences existing between a well-bred woman, that flower of the great world, and common women, though of the latter he did not know beyond one specimen.He was thus captured on the most accessible and sensitive sides of his soul and of his genius.Impelled by his simplicity, and by the impetuosity of his ideas, to lay immediate claim to this woman, he found himself restrained by society, also by the barrier which the manners and, let us say the word, the majesty of the princess placed between them.The conversation, which remained upon the topic of Michel Chrestien until the dessert, was an excellent pretext for both to speak in a low voice: love, sympathy, comprehension!she could pose as a maligned and misunderstood woman; he could slip his feet into the shoes of the dead republican.Perhaps his candid mind detected itself in regretting his dead friend less.The princess, at the moment when the dessert appeared upon the table, and the guests were separated by a brilliant hedge of fruits and sweetmeats, thought best to put an end to this flow of confidences by a charming little speech, in which she delicately expressed the idea that Daniel and Michel were twin souls."
"之后，德阿泰兹便融入了大伙泛泛的谈话之中，既像个小孩一样天真快乐，又像个中学生一样自我崇拜。他们离开客厅的时候，王妃以最纯朴的方式挽住德阿泰兹的胳膊，回到侯爵夫人的小客厅里去。穿过大厅时，王妃放慢了脚步，当她看到侯爵夫人挽着布隆代的胳膊，和他们之间有一段距离时，便让德阿泰兹停了下来。","After this d’Arthez threw himself into the general conversation with the gayety of a child, and a self-conceited air that was worthy of a schoolboy.When they left the dining-room, the princess took d’Arthez’s arm, in the simplest manner, to return to Madame d’Espard’s little salon.As they crossed the grand salon she walked slowly, and when sufficiently separated from the marquise, who was on Blondet’s arm, she stopped."
"“我不希望拒可怜的共和党人的朋友于千里之外，”她对德阿泰兹说，“虽然我给自己制定了规则——不再接待任何来访者。但是你在我这里永远都是受欢迎的。别觉得这是一种恩惠。恩惠只给予陌生人，而我觉得我们已经是老朋友了。我把你当作米歇尔的兄弟来看待。”","“I do not wish to be inaccessible to the friend of that poor man,” she said to d’Arthez; “and though I have made it a rule to receive no visitors, you will always be welcome in my house.Do not think this a favor.A favor is only for strangers, and to my mind you and I seem old friends; I see in you the brother of Michel.”"
"德阿泰兹只是紧紧挽住王妃的胳膊，没有作答。","D’Arthez could only press her arm, unable to make other reply."
"用完咖啡后，迪亚娜·德卡迪央妩媚地披上她的大披风后站了起来。布隆代和拉斯蒂涅作为极为高明的政治家，对事件的处理也是运筹帷幄，所以不会大呼小叫地挽留王妃。但是德帕夫人则是拉着她的手让她坐下，并凑到她的耳边说：","After coffee was served, Diane de Cadignan wrapped herself, with coquettish motions, in a large shawl, and rose.Blondet and Rastignac were too much men of the world, and too polite to make the least remonstrance, or try to detain her; but Madame d’Espard compelled her friend to sit down again, whispering in her ear:—"
"“再坐会儿吧，让仆人们吃过饭送你，这会儿马车还没备好呢。”","“Wait till the servants have had their dinner; the carriage is not ready yet.”"
"正说着，侯爵夫人向收拾咖啡托盘的仆人做了个手势。德蒙科尔内夫人猜想王妃和德帕夫人还有话要说，就把德阿泰兹、拉斯蒂涅和布隆代拉到她这里，并用巴黎女人最擅长的荒诞打趣儿和他们逗乐。","So saying, the marquise made a sign to the footman, who was taking away the coffee-tray.Madame de Montcornet perceived that the princess and Madame d’Espard had a word to say to each other, and she drew around her d’Arthez, Rastignac, and Blondet, amusing them with one of those clever paradoxical attacks which Parisian women understand so thoroughly."
"“喂，你觉得他怎么样？”侯爵夫人问迪亚娜。","“Well,” said the marquise to Diane, “what do you think of him?”"
"“他简直是一个可爱的孩子，像是刚从襁褓中出来！这回和过去一样，不费吹灰之力就胜利了。”","“He is an adorable child, just out of swaddling-clothes!This time, like all other times, it will only be a triumph without a struggle.”"
"“哎，这也太没劲儿了。”德帕夫人说，“可我们还有办法。”","“Well, it is disappointing,” said Madame d’Espard.“But we might evade it.”"
"“怎么做？”","“How?”"
"“让我做你的情敌。”","“Let me be your rival.”"
"“随你便吧。”王妃回答，“我已经下定主意了。天才是思想的一种表现；我不知道灵魂在那里占据什么样的位置。我们以后再谈这个问题。”","“Just as you please,” replied the princess.“I’ve decided on my course.Genius is a condition of the brain; I don’t know what the heart gets out of it; we’ll talk about that later.”"
"听了王妃最后这几句高深莫测的话之后，德帕夫人就和大家聊起天来，既没有因‘随你的便’这样冷漠的话感到受到冒犯，也对这次会面的结果不感兴趣。王妃在火炉旁的沙发上坐了大约一个钟头，一副懒洋洋的样子，那姿势就像介朗笔下的迪东，同时又聚精会神地听着别人的谈话，还时不时地带着既不加掩饰又不过分的仰慕神情看看达尼埃尔，车子备好了，她便和侯爵夫人握手告别，对蒙科尔内夫人点了点头便悄然离去。","Hearing the last few words, which were wholly incomprehensible to her, Madame d’Espard returned to the general conversation, showing neither offence at that indifferent “As you please,” nor curiosity as to the outcome of the interview.The princess stayed an hour longer, seated on the sofa near the fire, in the careless, nonchalant attitude of Guerin’s Dido, listening with the attention of an absorbed mind, and looking at Daniel now and then, without disguising her admiration, which never went, however, beyond due limits.She slipped away when the carriage was announced, with a pressure of the hand to the marquise, and an inclination of the head to Madame de Montcornet."
"晚会并未因王妃的离去而终止。大伙都来德阿泰兹这儿凑热闹，此时他神态激昂，想要大大施展自己的才华。布隆代和拉斯蒂涅两人无论在聪明和才智上，显然都是无人能比的。至于这两个女人，也早已在上流社会称得上最聪颖的人物。今晚的宴会好比是沙漠绿洲旅行中所做的简短的休憩。这是一种少有的幸福，特别受到这些处于上流社会沙龙和政界中，要时刻警觉彼此之间尔虞我诈的这些人物的好评。有些人有得天独厚的优势，他们就像造福人类的星星，其光辉既能启发人的智慧，又能温暖人的心房。德阿泰兹就属于这样的人物。一个作家到了这样的高位，就会习惯于自由发挥，就会忘了哪些事情在社会上是不该说的。他不可能像那些经常搞社会活动的人那样说话有所顾忌，但是他的怪癖思想给人新鲜感，所以人们并不对其加以批判。由于他这种少见的幽默风趣和他那充满青春朝气而又简单纯朴的心灵，使他成为今晚的奇特人物，给这个晚会增添了无尽的乐趣。他和拉斯蒂涅一起离开，男爵在送他回家的路上问他觉得王妃怎么样。","The evening concluded without any allusion to the princess.The other guests profited by the sort of exaltation which d’Arthez had reached, for he put forth the treasures of his mind.In Blondet and Rastignac he certainly had two acolytes of the first quality to bring forth the delicacy of his wit and the breadth of his intellect.As for the two women, they had long been counted among the cleverest in society.This evening was like a halt in the oasis of a desert,—a rare enjoyment, and well appreciated by these four persons, habitually victimized to the endless caution entailed by the world of salons and politics.There are beings who have the privilege of passing among men like beneficent stars, whose light illumines the mind, while its rays send a glow to the heart.D’Arthez was one of those beings.A writer who rises to his level, accustoms himself to free thought, and forgets that in society all things cannot be said; it is impossible for such a man to observe the restraint of persons who live in the world perpetually; but as his eccentricities of thought bore the mark of originality, no one felt inclined to complain.This zest, this piquancy, rare in mere talent, this youthfulness and simplicity of soul which made d’Arthez so nobly original, gave a delightful charm to this evening.He left the house with Rastignac, who, as they drove home, asked him how he liked the princess."
"“米歇尔爱她是有道理的。”德阿泰兹回答，“她的确是个不一般的女人。”","“Michel did well to love her,” replied d’Arthez; “she is, indeed, an extraordinary woman.”"
"“十分超凡。”拉斯蒂涅冷淡地说，“听你的口气，你已经爱上她了吧。不出三天你将会到她家里去。我对巴黎社会的这类事情如指掌了，知道你们之间将会发生些什么。那么，亲爱的达尼埃尔，我恳求你不要将金钱和爱情混为一谈。这么说吧，如果你觉得你对她有了爱慕之情，尽管去爱，可是要留心你的财产。她从没拿过也没要过任何男人一分钱，她那于克赛尔和卡迪央的家族太显赫了，不容许她做那样的事；但是据我所知，她除了花掉自己的一笔数目庞大的财产外，还挥霍掉好几百万其他男人的钱财。怎么花的？为什么花这么多钱？都花到哪些地方啦？谁都不晓得，连她自己都不知道。十三年前，我亲眼见她二十个月之内就挥霍完了一个可爱的年轻小伙子和一个老公证人的财产。”","“Very extraordinary,” replied Rastignac, dryly.“By the tone of your voice I should judge you were in love with her already.You will be in her house within three days; and I am too old a denizen of Paris not to know what will be the upshot of that.Well, my dear Daniel, I do entreat you not to allow yourself to be drawn into any confusion of interests, so to speak.Love the princess if you feel any love for her in your heart, but keep an eye on your fortune.She has never taken or asked a penny from any man on earth, she is far too much of a d’Uxelles and a Cadignan for that; but, to my knowledge, she has not only spent her own fortune, which was very considerable, but she has made others waste millions.How?why?by what means?No one knows; she doesn’t know herself.I myself saw her swallow up, some thirteen years ago, the entire fortune of a charming young fellow, and that of an old notary, in twenty months.”"
"“十三年前！她到底多大年纪了？”德阿泰兹惊叹道。","“Thirteen years ago!” exclaimed d’Arthez,—“why, how old is she now?”"
"“晚宴上你没看到她的儿子吗？德摩弗里纽斯公爵。那个十九岁的青年；那么十九岁加上十七岁是多少……","“Didn’t you see, at dinner,” replied Rastignac, laughing, “her son, the Duc de Maufrigneuse.That young man is nineteen years old; nineteen and seventeen make—”"
"“三十六岁！”这位作家惊叫道，“我以为她才二十岁。”","“Thirty-six!” cried the amazed author.“I gave her twenty.”"
"“她会接受的，你不必担心，对你来说，她永远都是二十岁。”拉斯蒂涅对他说。你将要步入一个最浪漫的世界。晚安，你到家了。”当马车驶入拜耳丰街德阿泰兹那漂亮的房子时男爵说，“这星期我们会在德图希小姐家见。”","“She’ll accept them,” said Rastignac; “but don’t be uneasy, she will always be twenty to you.You are about to enter the most fantastic of worlds.Good-night, here you are at home,” said the baron, as they entered the rue de Bellefond, where d’Arthez lived in a pretty little house of his own.“We shall meet at Mademoiselle des Touches’s in the course of the week.”"
"第三章 王妃进入角色","CHAPTER III THE PRINCESS GOES TO WORK"
"德阿泰兹就这样坠入情网，就像我们的托比大叔那样，没有做任何抵抗。他对这个女人无条件地崇拜，绝对地仰慕，他已经全身心地投入了这场恋爱。而王妃，这个高贵的生灵，这个丑陋的巴黎社会——所有事情（包括善恶）都可能存在——最杰出的创造之一，却成了他梦中的天使——无论时间的推移使这种表达变得多么粗俗。为了充分了解这位杰出的作家的突然转变，我们应当认识到，持续的工作和孤寂给他的心灵带来了简单。当对一个卑贱的女人所有的爱，降低到只是一种需要，继而让人感到厌恶时，爱情就会激发懊悔，并渴望灵魂深处那神圣的情感。聪明的德卡迪央王妃确实发现德阿泰兹像个孩子。而漂亮的迪亚娜也产生了和德阿泰兹一样的幻想。她最终遇到了这个令所有女人都痴狂的卓越男子，哪怕只是玩弄他——也是这些女人们愿意服从的一种力量，哪怕只是为获取征服这种力量的快乐。她终于找到了这样既有伟大智慧又有纯真灵魂的人，他给爱情注入了新鲜的活力。而且她有一种难以言表的快乐：她发现他身上的所有美德以一种让她喜悦的形式存在。她觉得德阿泰兹很英俊，或许他的确很英俊。尽管他已经到了沉稳的壮年（他已经三十八岁了），但他的生活严谨规矩，所以他依然青春犹存。和那些工作上需要久坐的人以及政客们一样，他的身体也相当丰腴。他年轻的时候，人们就觉得他和波拿巴·拿破仑有点相像。而这种相似至今仍未消失，虽然他的眼睛是黑的，头发又黑又浓，而那位君王的眼睛是蓝的，头发栗色而又稀疏。只是昔日这位伟大作家眼中所流露出的热切而崇高的锐气已被眼前的成功消磨殆尽了。他那曾饱含丰富思想的额头变得豁达明朗，那些曾经凹陷在脸上的皱纹也消失了。舒适的生活使他的脸色红润起来，而年轻时，贫困的生活使他不得不长期艰苦地工作，生活的压力使他的脸色暗黄。要是你仔细观察古代哲学家的尊贵脸庞，你总会从这种完美的脸庞中发现些偏差。每个脸庞都各有其特色，每个面部表情都有其根源性，深思的习惯以及脑力劳动所需的安静都磨练了他们的面部。比如像苏格拉底那类长相极不端正的人，经过长期的思考后，表情几乎接近神圣的安静。","D’Arthez allowed love to enter his heart after the manner of my Uncle Toby, without making the slightest resistance; he proceeded by adoration without criticism, and by exclusive admiration.The princess, that noble creature, one of the most remarkable creations of our monstrous Paris, where all things are possible, good as well as evil, became—whatever vulgarity the course of time may have given to the expression—the angel of his dreams.To fully understand the sudden transformation of this illustrious author, it is necessary to realize the simplicity that constant work and solitude leave in the heart; all that love—reduced to a mere need, and now repugnant, beside an ignoble woman—excites of regret and longings for diviner sentiments in the higher regions of the soul.D’Arthez was, indeed, the child, the boy that Madame de Cadignan had recognized.An illumination something like his own had taken place in the beautiful Diane.At last she had met that superior man whom all women desire and seek, if only to make a plaything of him,—that power which they consent to obey, if only for the pleasure of subduing it; at last she had found the grandeurs of the intellect united with the simplicity of a heart all new to love; and she saw, with untold happiness, that these merits were contained in a form that pleased her.She thought D’Arthez handsome, and perhaps he was.Though he had reached the age of gravity (for he was now thirty-eight), he still preserved a flower of youth, due to the sober and ascetic life which he had led.Like all men of sedentary habits, and statesmen, he had acquired a certainly reasonable embonpoint.When very young, he bore some resemblance to Bonaparte; and the likeness still continued, as much as a man with black eyes and thick, dark hair could resemble a sovereign with blue eyes and scanty, chestnut hair.But whatever there once was of ardent and noble ambition in the great author’s eyes had been somewhat quenched by successes.The thoughts with which that brow once teemed had flowered; the lines of the hollow face were filling out.Ease now spread its golden tints where, in youth, poverty had laid the yellow tones of the class of temperament whose forces band together to support a crushing and long-continued struggle.If you observe carefully the noble faces of ancient philosophers, you will always find those deviations from the type of a perfect human face which show the characteristic to which each countenance owes its originality, chastened by the habit of meditation, and by the calmness necessary for intellectual labor.The most irregular features, like those of Socrates, for instance, become, after a time, expressive of an almost divine serenity."
"德阿泰兹的头部高贵而质朴，除此之外，他还有孩子般天真自然的表情，以及动人的和蔼可亲。他没有那种虚假的礼貌，而社会上那些最有教养、最友好善良的人却利用这种虚假的礼貌，竭力表现他们所不具备的各种品质，结果往往使那些被欺骗的人遭受伤害和痛苦。由于离群索居，德阿泰兹可能的确没有注意到世俗社会的一些规则，但他从不触犯别人，因此，他这种原始的个性使这样一个天才人物异常地平易近人。这样的人知道如何在研究中放低架势，将自己摆在社会的平等位置，他们能像亨利四世那样，让孩子在自己的脊背上玩跳背游戏，为愚笨的人出谋划策。","To the noble simplicity which characterized his head, d’Arthez added a naive expression, the naturalness of a child, and a touching kindliness.He did not have that politeness tinged with insincerity with which, in society, the best-bred persons and the most amiable assume qualities in which they are often lacking, leaving those they have thus duped wounded and distressed.He might, indeed, fail to observe certain rules of social life, owing to his isolated mode of living; but he never shocked the sensibilities, and therefore this perfume of savagery made the peculiar affability of a man of great talent the more agreeable; such men know how to leave their superiority in their studies, and come down to the social level, lending their backs, like Henry IV., to the children’s leap-frog, and their minds to fools."
"王妃回到家时没有将这件事放在心上，就像德阿泰兹在王妃施展的魅力面前不想进行任何反抗。她对目前的情况很清楚。她既以自己的全部知识，又以自己的全部无知进行恋爱。如果她对自己有任何质疑的话，那就是问问自己，是否配得上如此伟大的幸福，她究竟做了什么好事，上帝竟然给她派来这样一个天使。她不愿辜负这份爱情，并想使它永存，永远地为自己所有，以便在她所能预知的天堂里慢慢结束自己放纵的生活。至于卖弄风情、吹毛求疵、攻击别人之类的事情，她想都没想过。她所想的完全是别的事情，比如天才人物的伟大之处，她猜想到天才人物是不会将他们选择的女人置于通常的律法之下的。","If d’Arthez did not brace himself against the spell which the princess had cast about him, neither did she herself argue the matter in her own mind, on returning home.It was settled for her.She loved with all her knowledge and all her ignorance.If she questioned herself at all, it was to ask whether she deserved so great a happiness, and what she had done that Heaven should send her such an angel.She wanted to be worthy of that love, to perpetuate it, to make it her own forever, and to gently end her career of frivolity in the paradise she now foresaw.As for coquetting, quibbling, resisting, she never once thought of it.She was thinking of something very different!—of the grandeur of men of genius, and the certainty which her heart divined that they would never subject the woman they chose to ordinary laws."
"这样一出无人知晓的喜剧开演了，这出戏在两个人物的内心深处上演，其中一个势必上另一个的当，但它继续上演着邪恶的一面。这是一出既险恶又滑稽的戏。与此相比，《伪君子》真可谓是小巫见到大巫。虽然这不是舞台上的戏，但这些情节既自然又真实，而且是迫不得已而为。这不是一出邪恶的戏，只是邪恶的反面而已。","Here begins one of those unseen comedies, played in the secret regions of the consciousness between two beings of whom one will be the dupe of the other, though it keeps on this side of wickedness; one of those dark and comic dramas to which that of @Tartuffe@ is mere child’s play,—dramas that do not enter the scenic domain, although they are natural, conceivable, and even justifiable by necessity; dramas which may be characterized as not vice, only the other side of it."
"王妃开始叫人搜集德阿泰兹的著作。关于他的著作，王妃之前连一个字都没看过。即便如此，她也曾和他就其作品进行过二十分钟充满溢美之辞的讨论而未露任何破绽。现在她读了他所有的书。她打算将他的书和当代文学中最好的著作进行比较。德阿泰兹来看她的时候，她精神上真有些消化不良。在这次拜访之前，她每天都要做一次高超的打扮，而且每次打扮都表达一种思想，使人通过眼睛接受它，但却不知道为什么。她身穿搭配得体的灰色装束，给人一种和谐之美，带点忧伤的色调，又有种脱俗的优雅。女人穿这样的服装，说明她已经厌倦了自己的生活，只是为了维系骨肉亲情，比如为了自己的儿子才继续活着。她的穿戴显示了她虽然厌恶生活，但依然保持着高雅的格调，还不至于到自杀的地步。她不会自杀的，她要在尘世中度过余生。","The princess began by sending for d’Arthez’s books, of which she had never, as yet, read a single word, although she had managed to maintain a twenty minutes’ eulogism and discussion of them without a blunder.She now read them all.Then she wanted to compare these books with the best that contemporary literature had produced.By the time d’Arthez came to see her she was having an indigestion of mind.Expecting this visit, she had daily made a toilet of what may be called the superior order; that is, a toilet which expresses an idea, and makes it accepted by the eye without the owner of the eye knowing why or wherefore.She presented an harmonious combination of shades of gray, a sort of semi-mourning, full of graceful renunciation,—the garments of a woman who holds to life only through a few natural ties,—her child, for instance,—but who is weary of life.Those garments bore witness to an elegant disgust, not reaching, however, as far as suicide; no, she would live out her days in these earthly galleys."
"她像一个期待德阿泰兹来临的女人那样接待他，好像他已经拜访过她上百次了。她像对待一个老熟人一样对待他，示意他坐到沙发上，等候她写完信函，这让他觉得轻松自在。他们的谈话以最普通的方式进行：谈论天气，谈论部里情况，还有德马尔赛的病情以及正统派的期望等。德阿泰兹是个专制主义者，会议厅内坐着十五或二十个代表正统王朝派的人，德阿泰兹坐在其中，王妃不可能忽视他的政见。王妃设法告诉他，她当初如何尽情地愚弄德马尔赛，然后把话题轻松地转移到皇室和夫人，以及德卡迪央亲王对王室所做的贡献。这样，她便把德阿泰兹的注意力移到了亲王身上：","She received d’Arthez as a woman who expected him, and as if he had already been to see her a hundred times; she did him the honor to treat him like an old acquaintance, and she put him at his ease by pointing to a seat on a sofa, while she finished a note she was then writing.The conversation began in a commonplace manner: the weather, the ministry, de Marsay’s illness, the hopes of the legitimists.D’Arthez was an absolutist; the princess could not be ignorant of the opinions of a man who sat in the Chamber among the fifteen or twenty persons who represented the legitimist party; she found means to tell him how she had fooled de Marsay to the top of his bent, then, by an easy transition to the royal family and to “Madame,” and the devotion of the Prince de Cadignan to their service, she drew d’Arthez’s attention to the prince:—"
"“这是我想替他说的，他热爱他的主人们，对他们忠心耿耿。他的个人生活使我受到种种痛苦，但他一心为公的气概又使我感到安慰。”她接着说，很巧妙地把亲王置于话题之外，“你什么都懂，但你是否注意到男人都有两种性格：一种是在私人生活中，对待家庭、妻子时的性格——这是真我，真我里不用带着面具过活，没有伪装，也不必费劲地掩饰真实感情，他们表现出来的就是本来面目，不过这种真实面目常常是可怕的！另一个是面对别人、面对世界、面对各种沙龙的性格。宫廷、君主以及政界和公众往往觉得他们伟大、高贵、慷慨，觉得他们拥有高尚的美德、温文尔雅的谈吐，还有浑身洋溢着的令人钦羡的才华。这是个多么恐怖的玩笑！——有时候人们奇怪，为什么某些女人和丈夫在一起时脸上还有刻薄的笑容，为什么她们在丈夫面前盛气凌人，对丈夫态度冷漠。”","“There is this to be said for him: he loved his masters, and was faithful to them.His public character consoles me for the sufferings his private life has inflicted upon me—Have you never remarked,” she went on, cleverly leaving the prince aside, “you who observe so much, that men have two natures: one of their homes, their wives, their private lives,—this is their true self; here no mask, no dissimulation; they do not give themselves the trouble to disguise a feeling; they are what they ARE, and it is often horrible!The other man is for others, for the world, for salons; the court, the sovereign, the public often see them grand, and noble, and generous, embroidered with virtues, adorned with fine language, full of admirable qualities.What a horrible jest it is!—and the world is surprised, sometimes, at the caustic smile of certain women, at their air of superiority to their husbands, and their indifference—”"
"王妃的手顺着椅子扶手垂下来，虽然话还没有说完，但这个动作却暗示着她已极好地表达完了自己的意思。她看到德阿泰兹正出神地注视着她那优雅地靠在软绵绵的座椅之中的柔软的身体，并注视着她长袍的曲线和她说话时在她胸部起伏的一个小褶皱（这种大胆的设计只适合腰身苗条的人），王妃重新理顺思路，好像在自言自语。","She let her hand fall along the arm of her chair, without ending her sentence, but the gesture admirably completed the speech.She saw d’Arthez watching her flexible figure, gracefully bending in the depths of her easy-chair, noting the folds of her gown, and the pretty little ruffle which sported on her breast,—one of those audacities of the toilet that are suited only to slender waists,—and she resumed the thread of her thoughts as if she were speaking to herself:—"
"“但是我不再说下去了。你们这些作家最终会把那些自认为被人误解或没有遇上好配偶，但却又试图引人注意的女人，弄得十分可笑。我必须说，这些行为在我看来是难以忍受的可耻行为。在这种困境下，女人只有两种选择——服从，则一切成定局；反抗，则会使自己陷入玩世不恭的境地。不论在哪种情况下，她们都应保持缄默。当然我既不会完全服从，也不会完全反抗。也许这是我应该保持沉默的最大的理由。女人们老是抱怨，这是多么愚蠢呀！如果她们不能证明自己比别人强，那是因为她们不够理智，没有谋略，缺乏能力，那么她们就该接受自己的命运。在法国，不是有的女人当上了法国皇后吗？她们随心所欲地玩弄男人，想什么时候玩弄就什么时候玩弄，想怎样玩弄就怎样玩弄。”她带着一种女性特有的鲁莽和嘲弄的神情抚弄着她的小香盒。“我经常听到一些可怜的同胞悔恨自己身为女人，她们宁愿生为男人。我总是带着同情的眼光看她们。要是让我选择的话，我还会选择做女人。靠威力取胜，靠你自己制定的所有律法所赋予你自己的一切权力取胜，这确实能给你带来快乐。但当我们看到你们跪在我们脚下，说傻话，做蠢事的时候——啊！我们会由衷地感到，这是弱者取得的胜利，这种快乐令人陶醉！而当我们真正胜利的时候，我们就应当保持沉默，不然我们就会失掉应有的威严。要是被打败了，女人的自尊心更应使自己保持沉默。而奴隶的沉默会使主人恐慌。”","“But I will say no more.You writers have ended by making ridiculous all women who think they are misunderstood, or ill-mated, and who try to make themselves dramatically interesting,—attempts which seem to me, I must say, intolerably vulgar.There are but two things for women in that plight to do,—yield, and all is over; resist, and amuse themselves; in either case they should keep silence.It is true that I neither yielded wholly, nor resisted wholly; but, perhaps, that was only the more reason why I should be silent.What folly for women to complain!If they have not proved the stronger, they have failed in sense, in tact, in capacity, and they deserve their fate.Are they not queens in France?They can play with you as they like, when they like, and as much as they like.”Here she danced her vinaigrette with an airy movement of feminine impertinence and mocking gayety.“I have often heard miserable little specimens of my sex regretting that they were women, wishing they were men; I have always regarded them with pity.If I had to choose, I should still elect to be a woman.A fine pleasure, indeed, to owe one’s triumph to force, and to all those powers which you give yourselves by the laws you make!But to see you at our feet, saying and doing foolish things,—ah!it is an intoxicating pleasure to feel within our souls that weakness triumphs!But when we triumph, we ought to keep silence, under pain of losing our empire.Beaten, a woman’s pride should gag her.The slave’s silence alarms the master.”"
"她娇声娇气地谈论着，话语中带着几分讽刺与嘲弄，还不时地夹带着如此妩媚的头部动作。德阿泰兹从未见识过这种女人，他简直像一只鹧鸪碰上猎犬似的被镇住了。","This chatter was uttered in a voice so softly sarcastic, so dainty, and with such coquettish motions of the head, that d’Arthez, to whom this style of woman was totally unknown, sat before her exactly like a partridge charmed by a setter."
"“我恳求您，夫人，”他终于说话了，“请您告诉我，一个男人怎么能够使您遭受痛苦呢？我敢断言，正如你所说的，在别的女人都显得庸俗普通的场合下，唯独您能够显得那样高贵。还有您说起话来，简直能使一本枯燥的菜谱变得引人入胜。”","“I entreat you, madame,” he said, at last, “to tell me how it was possible that a man could make you suffer?Be assured that where, as you say, other women are common and vulgar, you can only seem distinguished; your manner of saying things would make a cook-book interesting.”"
"“您的友谊来得真快，”她的语调变得有些严肃，这令德阿泰兹极为不安。","“You go fast in friendship,” she said, in a grave voice which made d’Arthez extremely uneasy."
"他们转换了话题，而且时间也不早了，这位可怜的天才人物离开的时候后悔自己显得好奇，后悔自己伤害了那颗敏感的心，那个有过不同寻常遭遇的不凡的女人的心。而她的生活已经在同男人的寻欢作乐中度过了，她就是女性中的唐璜，不同的是：她当然不会邀请石像来赴宴，她比任何石像都厉害。","The conversation changed; the hour was late, and the poor man of genius went away contrite for having seemed curious, and for wounding the sensitive heart of that rare woman who had so strangely suffered.As for her, she had passed her life in amusing herself with men, and was another Don Juan in female attire, with this difference: she would certainly not have invited the Commander to supper, and would have got the better of any statue."
"不提一提卡迪央亲王，这个故事就不可能继续下去。这位亲王又被称为德摩弗里纽斯公爵，他的这个称呼更为人所知。不把情况交代清楚，王妃的谎言就会索然无味，不明就里的人就很难理解她为玩弄这个天才人物所上演的巴黎闹剧。","It is impossible to continue this tale without saying a word about the Prince de Cadignan, better known under the name of the Duc de Maufrigneuse, otherwise the spice of the princess’s confidences would be lost, and strangers would not understand the Parisian comedy she was about to play for her man of genius."
"德摩弗里纽斯公爵是老德卡迪央亲王的嫡子，他是一个身材瘦长、外表儒雅的人，温文尔雅、谈吐幽默。蒙上帝厚爱，他当上了上校，又因偶然的机会被评为优秀军人。他有波兰人的勇猛，这说明他没有理智和清醒的头脑。他善于用社交界流行的行话来掩盖自己的无知。从三十六岁起，他就像他的国王夏尔十世一样，被迫对女性完全失去兴趣，他也曾像他的国王一样，因太招女人喜欢而受惩罚。十八年间，他一直是圣日耳曼地区的人们崇拜的偶像，他像所有的贵族子弟一样，曾经过着放纵的生活，整日里寻欢作乐，无所事事。他的父亲在大革命中遭到迫害，波旁王朝复辟后又恢复职位，管理一处皇宫，有着丰厚的薪金和津贴。但是这种不明的财富使老亲王过上优裕生活的同时，也使他革命前的贵族霸气延续下来；以至于赔偿法通过后，他得到的所有赔款都花在了他那宏伟的官邸的豪华排场上。","The Duc de Maufrigneuse, like a true son of the old Prince de Cadignan, is a tall, lean man, of elegant shape, very graceful, a sayer of witty things, colonel by the grace of God, and a good soldier by accident; brave as a Pole, which means without sense or discernment, and hiding the emptiness of his mind under the jargon of good society.After the age of thirty-six he was forced to be as absolutely indifferent to the fair sex as his master Charles X., punished, like that master, for having pleased it too well.For eighteen years the idol of the faubourg Saint-Germain, he had, like other heirs of great families led a dissipated life, spent solely on pleasure.His father, ruined by the revolution, had somewhat recovered his position on the return of the Bourbons, as governor of a royal domain, with salary and perquisites; but this uncertain fortune the old prince spent, as it came, in keeping up the traditions of a great seigneur before the revolution; so that when the law of indemnity was passed, the sums he received were all swallowed up in the luxury he displayed in his vast hotel."
"这位德卡迪央老亲王在七月革命不久后便去世了，享年八十七岁。他挥霍完了他妻子的财产，之后很长一段时间，他和德纳瓦兰公爵关系不愉快，这个人娶了他的女儿做第一任妻子，老公爵到最后也很不情愿向他偿还债务。德摩弗里纽斯公爵以前和德于克赛尔斯公爵夫人关系甚为亲密。大约一八一四年，德摩弗里公爵四十六岁，那时他还是一贫如洗，公爵夫人可怜他，见他在宫廷受到重视，就将女儿迪亚娜嫁给他。她女儿那时才十七岁，就拥有大约五六万法郎的年金，还不包括她将来继承母亲的遗产。德于克赛尔斯小姐就这样成了公爵夫人，正如她母亲所预见的那样，她享有绝对的自由。出乎意料的幸福降临到公爵身上，他有了继承人后，便让他妻子在行动上享有完全的自由，而他自己则从法国这个驻地到另一个驻地，尽情娱乐，偶尔才返回巴黎。他在巴黎欠了很多债，还得由他父亲来偿还。他声称给妻子最大限度的宽容，总是在他回家前提前一周通知公爵夫人。他受到部队人的崇拜，得到皇太子的宠爱，他是一个机智的仕臣，虽有点喜欢赌博，但完全不矫揉造作。公爵继承了父亲生前的职务，管辖着一片皇室的领地，并且非常懂得如何取悦路易十八和查理十世，这足以证明他虽没什么才干，却也尽力做到最好，甚至自由派也都喜欢他。不过，他的这种表现和生活全都经过了最鲜亮的清漆粉饰：优雅的言谈，贵族的礼节和风度都被他发挥到了极致。然而，正如老亲王所说，他是不可能再继续卡迪央家的吃光老婆财产这一传统了，因为公爵夫人已经把自己的财产吃光了。","The old prince died some little time before the revolution of July aged eighty-seven.He had ruined his wife, and had long been on bad terms with the Duc de Navarreins, who had married his daughter for a first wife, and to whom he very reluctantly rendered his accounts.The Duc de Maufrigneuse, early in life, had had relations with the Duchesse d’Uxelles.About the year 1814, when Monsieur de Maufrigneuse was forty-six years of age, the duchess, pitying his poverty, and seeing that he stood very well at court, gave him her daughter Diane, then in her seventeenth year, and possessing, in her own right, some fifty or sixty thousand francs a year, not counting her future expectations.Mademoiselle d’Uxelles thus became a duchess, and, as her mother very well knew, she enjoyed the utmost liberty.The duke, after obtaining the unexpected happiness of an heir, left his wife entirely to her own devices, and went off to amuse himself in the various garrisons of France, returning occasionally to Paris, where he made debts which his father paid.He professed the most entire conjugal indulgence, always giving the duchess a week’s warning of his return; he was adored by his regiment, beloved by the Dauphin, an adroit courtier, somewhat of a gambler, and totally devoid of affectation.Having succeeded to his father’s office as governor of one of the royal domains, he managed to please the two kings, Louis XVIII. and Charles X., which proves he made the most of his nonentity; and even the liberals liked him; but his conduct and life were covered with the finest varnish; language, noble manners, and deportment were brought by him to a state of perfection.But, as the old prince said, it was impossible for him to continue the traditions of the Cadignans, who were all well known to have ruined their wives, for the duchess was running through her property on her own account."
"这些细节在宫廷里和圣日耳曼地区已广为人知，因此在王政复辟时期的最后五年里，大家都觉得这些事已经成了久远的历史，如果有谁提及便会遭到嘲笑。提起这位充满魅力的公爵，女人们总是恭维备至。她们说公爵对妻子好得不得了，没有一个比他更好的男人了。他任妻子自由地支配自己的财产并随时随地地保护她。尽管公爵夫人有很多侍从，并且有德于克塞尔老公爵夫人，纳瓦兰公爵，她的公公和她丈夫的姑母的声望作后盾，有一点是肯定的：不管是出于自尊心，善意还是出于骑士精神，德摩弗里纽斯先生在各种不同场合下都救过公爵夫人，而如果其他女人遇到这些情况可能就会遭殃。","These particulars were so well understood in the court circles and in the faubourg Saint-Germain, that during the last five years of the Restoration they were considered ancient history, and any one who mentioned them would have been laughed at.Women never spoke of the charming duke without praising him; he was excellent, they said, to his wife; could a man be better?He had left her the entire disposal of her own property, and had always defended her on every occasion.It is true that, whether from pride, kindliness, or chivalry, Monsieur de Maufrigneuse had saved the duchess under various circumstances which might have ruined other women, in spite of Diane’s surroundings, and the influence of her mother and that of the Duc de Navarreins, her father-in-law, and her husband’s aunt."
"几天来，在德阿泰兹眼中，王妃在文学方面的知识显得越来越出色。由于日夜苦读，她能大胆地谈论那些最困难的问题。这种不畏艰苦的精神是最值得赞扬的。德阿泰兹大为惊讶，他怎么也无法相信迪亚娜·德于克塞尔竟然能在晚上就把当天早晨阅读的东西复述出来（像一些作家一样）。因此，他把她看作是位优秀的女人。然而这些谈话远离了迪亚娜的目标，曾经在她撒娇似的拒绝之后，德阿泰兹谨慎地退却了，她现在试图重新拥有情人间亲密无间的感觉；可是要想让他这种个性的人在曾经被吓跑的情况下回心转意，并非像她想得那么容易。","For several ensuing days the princess revealed herself to d’Arthez as remarkable for her knowledge of literature.She discussed with perfect fearlessness the most difficult questions, thanks to her daily and nightly reading, pursued with an intrepidity worthy of the highest praise.D’Arthez, amazed, and incapable of suspecting that Diane d’Uxelles merely repeated at night that which she read in the morning (as some writers do), regarded her as a most superior woman.These conversations, however, led away from Diane’s object, and she tried to get back to the region of confidences from which d’Arthez had prudently retired after her coquettish rebuff; but it was not as easy as she expected to bring back a man of his nature who had once been startled away."
"然而，经过一个月的文学论战和柏拉图式的空谈之后，德阿泰兹变得大胆起来，每天三点钟就前来拜访，六点钟告辞，晚九点再来，然后一直呆到半夜或凌晨一点钟，很有规律，很像是一个热情的，急不可耐的情人。每次德阿泰兹要来的时候，王妃总是或多或少要琢磨下怎么打扮才算典雅。这种相互讨好，这种彼此对于外表的在意，事实上都表明了双方不敢承认的感情。王妃非常明白，这个大男孩害怕最后的摊牌，而她却非常渴望有这么一次摊牌。尽管如此，德阿泰兹在无言的表白中渗透着一丝敬畏，这使得王妃无比喜欢。彼此都感觉到每天他们都变得更加统一，因为没有任何事先的协议或者确切的规定能够阻止两人想法的接近，不像通常的恋人那样，一方提出明确的要求，而另一方加以拒绝，不管这拒绝是出于真心还是故意撒娇。","However, after a month of literary campaigning and the finest platonic discourses, d’Arthez grew bolder, and arrived every day at three o’clock.He retired at six, and returned at nine, to remain until midnight, or one in the morning, with the regularity of an ardent and impatient lover.The princess was always dressed with more or less studied elegance at the hour when d’Arthez presented himself.This mutual fidelity, the care they each took of their appearance, in fact, all about them expressed sentiments that neither dared avow, for the princess discerned very plainly that the great child with whom she had to do shrank from the combat as much as she desired it.Nevertheless d’Arthez put into his mute declarations a respectful awe which was infinitely pleasing to her.Both felt, every day, all the more united because nothing acknowledged or definite checked the course of their ideas, as occurs between lovers when there are formal demands on one side, and sincere or coquettish refusals on the other."
"像所有那些看起来比实际年龄小的年轻人一样，德阿泰兹也处于这种犹豫不决的窘境之中，他们既有强烈的情欲又害怕不能讨情人的欢心，如果一个年轻女人也处于同样的境地，她根本无法理解其中的滋味。然而，王妃就经常故意制造这种窘境并能从中得到乐趣。事实上，迪亚娜极其享受这种令人愉悦的儿戏，因为她懂得自己可以随时结束这种游戏。她就像是一位伟大的艺术家，欣赏着自己勾勒的草图里模糊的、没有成形的线条，因为她确信只要灵感到来就会完成一幅杰作。不知有多少次，看到德阿泰兹刚要前行时，王妃就用其威严的神气突然将他阻止，并且乐在其中。她能轻易地击退这个年轻人心中的秘密风暴，她只需要一个眼神，伸手让他一吻，或是用温柔的语调说些无关痛痒的话，就可以重新掀起或者平息这种风暴。","Like all men younger than their actual age, d’Arthez was a prey to those agitating irresolutions which are caused by the force of desires and the terror of displeasing,—a situation which a young woman does not comprehend when she shares it, but which the princess had too often deliberately produced not to enjoy its pleasures.In fact, Diane enjoyed these delightful juvenilities all the more keenly because she knew that she could put an end to them at any moment.She was like a great artist delighting in the vague, undecided lines of his sketch, knowing well that in a moment of inspiration he can complete the masterpiece still waiting to come to birth.Many a time, seeing d’Arthez on the point of advancing, she enjoyed stopping him short, with an imposing air and manner.She drove back the hidden storms of that still young heart, raised them again, and stilled them with a look, holding out her hand to be kissed, or saying some trifling insignificant words in a tender voice."
"这些看似在计划中冷酷无情，在执行中却又让人欣喜陶醉的手法，使她的形象深深地刻在了这位伟大的作家、思想家的灵魂里。她喜欢把他变成身旁一个轻信的、天真无邪的、思想单纯的、甚至是有点傻气的孩子。然而，有些时侯她也会对自己的行为感到厌恶，也会禁不住欣赏德阿泰兹那种单纯的伟大。这种精心策划的游戏在不知不觉中，竟把她和她的奴隶束缚在一起了。然而，最终，迪亚娜对于这位坠入情网的爱比克泰德的耐心越来越少。当她确信已经让他唯命是从的时候，还是把更厚实的绷带蒙在他的眼睛上。","These manoeuvres, planned in cold blood, but enchantingly executed, carved her image deeper and deeper on the soul of that great writer and thinker whom she revelled in making childlike, confiding, simple, and almost silly beside her.And yet she had moments of repulsion against her own act, moments in which she could not help admiring the grandeur of such simplicity.This game of choicest coquetry attached her, insensibly, to her slave.At last, however, Diane grew impatient with an Epictetus of love; and when she thought she had trained him to the utmost credulity, she set to work to tie a thicker bandage still over his eyes."
"第四章 一位美丽女人的表白","CHAPTER IV THE CONFESSION OF A PRETTY WOMAN"
"一天晚上，达尼埃尔发现王妃正在沉思，一只胳膊靠在一张小桌子上，漂亮的金色头发沐浴在灯光之中。她手中正玩弄着桌子上的一封信。当德阿泰兹已经看清楚是封信后，她便折叠了起来，塞到腰带里。","One evening Daniel found the princess thoughtful, one elbow resting on a little table, her beautiful blond head bathed in light from the lamp.She was toying with a letter which lay on the table-cloth.When d’Arthez had seen the paper distinctly, she folded it up, and stuck it in her belt."
"“出什么事了？”德阿泰兹问道，“你看上去好像有什么心事似的。”","“What is the matter?” asked d’Arthez; “you seem distressed.”"
"“我收到了一封来自德卡迪央先生的信。”她答道，“不管他曾经对我做过什么错事，我还是会禁不住想到他从故乡被流放的遭遇——没有了家，儿子也不在身边。”","“I have received a letter from Monsieur de Cadignan,” she replied.“However great the wrongs he has done me, I cannot help thinking of his exile—without family, without son—from his native land.”"
"这些充满深情的话语充分显示出了王妃天使般的同情心。德阿泰兹被深深地感动了。可以说，这个情人的好奇心已经变成了心理学和文学上的好奇心了。他想知道这个女人到底高尚到了什么程度，她所能宽恕的伤害到底有多深；他急切地想了解像世界上这种被指责为轻浮、铁石心肠又自私自利的贵妇怎么可以如此善良。他回想起了以前第一次试图读懂这颗高尚的心时所遭到的拒绝，此刻，当握住美丽的迪亚娜那双透亮、柔软的纤纤玉手时，他本人都战栗了，并用其颤抖的声音说道：","These words, said in a soulful voice, betrayed angelic sensibility.D’Arthez was deeply moved.The curiosity of the lover became, so to speak, a psychological and literary curiosity.He wanted to know the height that woman had attained, and what were the injuries she thus forgave; he longed to know how these women of the world, taxed with frivolity, cold-heartedness, and egotism, could be such angels.Remembering how the princess had already repulsed him when he first tried to read that celestial heart, his voice, and he himself, trembled as he took the transparent, slender hand of the beautiful Diane with its curving finger-tips, and said,—"
"“我们现在的友谊能否让你把所遭遇的痛苦都告诉我呢？”","“Are we now such friends that you will tell me what you have suffered?”"
"“当然可以。”她说道，这几个字就像蒂卢的笛子里传出的最悦耳的音符那样让人感到甜蜜。","“Yes,” she said, breathing forth the syllable like the most mellifluous note that Tulou’s flute had ever sighed."
"接着，她再次陷入了沉思，眼神变得迷离。此刻，达尼埃尔仍忐忑不安地等待着回答，深感这一时刻的庄严。他诗人般的想象力仿佛使他看到云朵正缓缓地消散，展现在眼前的是一座圣殿，而圣殿里，上帝脚边跪着的是那只受伤的羔羊。","Then she fell into a revery, and her eyes were veiled.Daniel remained in a state of anxious expectation, impressed with the solemnity of the occasion.His poetic imagination made him see, as it were, clouds slowly dispersing and disclosing to him the sanctuary where the wounded lamb was kneeling at the divine feet."
"“到底怎么了？”他以一种温柔平和的语气问道。","“Well?” he said, in a soft, still voice."
"迪亚娜看了这位温柔的请求者一眼；然后又慢慢地低下头，垂下眼睛，眼波中流露出一种高贵的谦卑。也许只有铁石心肠之人才会想象这脖颈的优雅曲线中藏有虚伪的成分。接着，王妃再次仰起迷人的头颅，重新注视着这位伟大人物渴求的眼睛。","Diane looked at the tender petitioner; then she lowered her eyes slowly, dropping their lids with a movement of noble modesty.None but a monster would have been capable of imagining hypocrisy in the graceful undulation of the neck with which the princess again lifted her charming head, to look once more into the eager eyes of that great man."
"“我能说吗？我该说吗？”她一边犹豫不决地嘀咕着，一边无限温柔地注视着德阿泰兹，“男人们在这类事情上太不讲信用了，他们觉得没必要那么谨慎地替别人保密。”","“Can I?ought I?” she murmured, with a gesture of hesitation, gazing at d’Arthez with a sublime expression of dreamy tenderness.“Men have so little faith in things of this kind; they think themselves so little bound to be discreet!”"
"“啊！如果你不信任我，我为什么还站在这里？”德阿泰兹大声说道。","“Ah!if you distrust me, why am I here?” cried d’Arthez."
"“哎，我的朋友！”她答道，这声感叹犹如情不自禁的自白那样优雅，“当一个女人决定了自己的一生时，她还能有什么打算呢？问题的关键不在于我的拒绝（我又能拒绝你什么呢），而是在于如果我向你坦白，你对我会有什么看法呢？我倒是很想向你倾诉我在这个年龄所处的奇特地位；然而，如果一个女人揭露了自己婚姻中隐藏的创伤，你会作何感想呢？蒂雷纳曾对强盗遵守了自己的承诺；难道我就不该对折磨我的人表现出蒂雷纳似的信用吗？”","“Oh, friend!” she said, giving to the exclamation the grace of an involuntary avowal, “when a woman attaches herself for life, think you she calculates?It is not question of refusal (how could I refuse you anything?), but the idea of what you may think of me if I speak.I would willingly confide to you the strange position in which I am at my age; but what would you think of a woman who could reveal the secret wounds of her married life?Turenne kept his word to robbers; do I not owe to my torturers the honor of a Turenne?”"
"“你曾对别人承诺过要严守秘密吗？”","“Have you passed your word to say nothing?”"
"“德卡迪央先生并不认为有必要让我保密。难道你所要的并不单单是我的心？暴君！你想让我为了你而牺牲我的信用吗？”她说着，瞥了德阿泰兹一眼，以此来说明她对这场交心比对自己看得都要重。","“Monsieur de Cadignan did not think it necessary to bind me to secrecy—You are asking more than my soul!Tyrant!you want me to bury my honor itself in your breast,” she said, casting upon d’Arthez a look, by which she gave more value to her coming confidence than to her personal self."
"“如果你害怕我有什么恶意的话，你也把我这个人看得太平凡了点。”他说着，掩饰不了自己的苦楚。","“You must think me a very ordinary man, if you fear any evil, no matter what, from me,” he said, with ill-concealed bitterness."
"“请宽恕我吧，我的朋友。”她回答道，一边把他的手温柔地拉到自己手里，用手指抚摸着，“我知道你的优点。你曾把你的一生都告诉了我：高贵、美好、卓越，这些都和你的身份相符，也许，作为回报，我该告诉你我的一切。可是，我担心的是一旦我把不仅仅属于我自己的秘密向你倾吐之后，在你眼中的我就变得堕落了。何况，你——孤独者、诗人——又怎么能相信社会中存在这样的丑恶呢？啊！你不会想到，在那些表面看来和睦的家庭上演的戏码要远比你创作的戏剧更加悲情。你对那种光环背后的不幸一无所知。”","“Forgive me, friend,” she replied, taking his hand in hers caressingly, and letting her fingers wander gently over it.“I know your worth.You have related to me your whole life; it is noble, it is beautiful, it is sublime, and worthy of your name; perhaps, in return, I owe you mine.But I fear to lower myself in your eyes by relating secrets which are not wholly mine.How can you believe—you, a man of solitude and poesy—the horrors of social life?Ah! you little think when you invent your dramas that they are far surpassed by those that are played in families apparently united.You are wholly ignorant of certain gilded sorrows.”"
"“我全都知道！”他大声说道。","“I know all!” he cried."
"“不，你不知道。”","“No, you know nothing.”"
"德阿泰兹感到自己就像是在黑夜中迷失在阿尔卑斯山的人。当清晨的第一缕阳光初现时，发现自己竟站在悬崖边上。他迷茫地望着王妃，感到一股刺骨的凉气侵袭着他的后背。迪亚娜有一瞬间觉得这个天才男人会是个脆弱之人，然而，他眼中所散发出的光芒让她安了心。","D’Arthez felt like a man lost on the Alps of a dark night, who sees, at the first gleam of dawn, a precipice at his feet.He looked at the princess with a bewildered air, and felt a cold chill running down his back.Diane thought for a moment that her man of genius was a weakling, but a flash from his eyes reassured her."
"“对于我来说，你几乎成了一位法官。”她神情绝望地说道，“现在，就像被诽谤的人有权利表明自己无辜一样，我也有权利说出我的无辜。我曾经（如果有人还能回想起的话，就应该知道我是一个被社会所遗弃的可怜的隐居者）甚至现在仍然被指控为是一个行为轻佻、做尽缺德事的女人，不过这倒使我可以寻找一颗强壮的心作为庇护所，把自己藏在里面，不被别人驱逐出去。一直以来，我就认为自我辩解其实就是对无辜的一种侮辱；这也就是我不屑为自己辩解的原因。再说，我又能向谁诉说呢？像这种残酷的事只能向上帝或对我们来说接近上帝的人（如神父、我们自己的化身）诉说，唉！对此我非常了解，可是如果我的秘密放在这里，”她说着就把手放到了德阿泰兹的胸口处，“不如放在这里安全的话，”她又用手指压住自己的胸衣，“那么你就不是我所认识的伟大的德阿泰兹了，那么我也可能被骗了。”","“You have become to me almost my judge,” she said, with a desperate air.“I must speak now, in virtue of the right that all calumniated beings have to show their innocence.I have been, I am still (if a poor recluse forced by the world to renounce the world is still remembered) accused of such light conduct, and so many evil things, that it may be allowed me to find in one strong heart a haven from which I cannot be driven.Hitherto I have always considered self-justification an insult to innocence; and that is why I have disdained to defend myself.Besides, to whom could I appeal?Such cruel things can be confided to none but God or to one who seems to us very near Him—a priest, or another self.Well! I do know this, if my secrets are not as safe there,” she said, laying her hand on d’Arthez’s heart, “as they are here” (pressing the upper end of her busk beneath her fingers), “then you are not the grand d’Arthez I think you—I shall have been deceived.”"
"泪水湿润了德阿泰兹的眼睛，迪亚娜偷偷地注视着，目不转睛，好像要吞掉这些眼泪。","A tear moistened d’Arthez’s eyes, and Diane drank it in with a side look, which, however, gave no motion either to the pupils or the lids of her eyes."
"如同一只猫猛然向老鼠扑过去般迅速、敏捷。","It was quick and neat, like the action of a cat pouncing on a mouse."
"经过两个月礼仪般的交往以后，德阿泰兹第一次敢握起那只温暖芳香的手，拿到嘴边，给了它一个长吻，从手腕吻到指甲，使得王妃感觉一切将会如同文学作品中所述般顺利。她寻思着，天才般的人物肯定比那些自命不凡的人、善于社交的人、外交官，甚至比军人都更懂得如何恋爱，尽管那些人除了谈情说爱之外没有什么事可做。王妃是个情场高手，她非常清楚爱的能力主要反映在一些微不足道的小事上。对这一点非常了解的女人仅仅从一个简单的姿势就能预料到一场恋爱的前景；就像居维叶看到骨头的碎片就能说出这种碎片属于体积多大的动物、有角还是无角、肉食的还是草食的，或是两栖的，还有生于距今多少万年前。她现在很确信德阿泰兹在爱情上的想象力如同他在写作上的想象力一样丰富。于是，王妃觉得立刻把他引到其热情和信任的最高峰不失为一种明智之举。","D’Arthez, for the first time, after sixty days of protocols, ventured to take that warm and perfumed hand, and press it to his lips with a long-drawn kiss, extending from the wrist to the tip of the fingers, which made the princess augur well of literature.She thought to herself that men of genius must know how to love with more perfection than conceited fops, men of the world, diplomatists, and even soldiers, although such beings have nothing else to do.She was a connoisseur, and knew very well that the capacity for love reveals itself chiefly in mere nothings.A woman well informed in such matters can read her future in a simple gesture; just as Cuvier could say from the fragment of a bone: This belonged to an animal of such or such dimensions, with or without horns, carnivorous, herbivorous, amphibious, etc., age, so many thousand years.Sure now of finding in d’Arthez as much imagination in love as there was in his written style, she thought it wise to bring him up at once to the highest pitch of passion and belief."
"接着，她急速地把手收回来，动作是如此优雅，充满着多重感情。这比她说一句“够了，你是想让我死在你的面前不成”这样的话都来得简单明了。她与德阿泰兹对视了好一会儿，眼睛里包含了各种各样的情感：幸福、虚伪、恐惧、信任、忧郁、暧昧的欲望以及处女的羞涩。此刻，她感觉只有二十岁而已。不过，要记住她为了这次喜剧性的撒谎时刻，在打扮上曾经花费了前所未有的艺术匠心。此刻，她坐在沙发上，就像一朵含苞待放的鲜花，等待着朝阳的到来。不管是真情还是假意，王妃已经使达尼埃尔陶醉了。","She withdrew her hand hastily, with a magnificent movement full of varied emotions.If she had said in words: “Stop, or I shall die,” she could not have spoken more plainly.She remained for a moment with her eyes in d’Arthez’s eyes, expressing in that one glance happiness, prudery, fear, confidence, languor, a vague longing, and virgin modesty.She was twenty years old!but remember, she had prepared for this hour of comic falsehood by the choicest art of dress; she was there in her armchair like a flower, ready to blossom at the first kiss of sunshine.True or false, she intoxicated Daniel."
"这里请允许我冒昧地插上一句个人的观点：我们必须得承认如果像这样一直被骗下去，确实不失为一件令人快乐的事。当然，舞台上的塔尔马往往比现实中的她要强得多。然而，德卡迪央王妃才是我们这个时代最了不起的喜剧演员啊。她所欠缺的也就是全神贯注的观众而已。不幸的是，在被政治风暴搅扰的年代里，女人们都像水莲花那样消失了，只有晴朗的天空和温柔的和风才能使其绽放，满足我们渴求的眼睛。","It if is permissible to risk a personal opinion we must avow that it would be delightful to be thus deceived for a good long time.Certainly Talma on the stage was often above and beyond nature, but the Princesse de Cadignan is the greatest true comedian of our day.Nothing was wanting to this woman but an attentive audience.Unfortunately, at epochs perturbed by political storms, women disappear like water-lilies which need a cloudless sky and balmy zephyrs to spread their bloom to our enraptured eyes."
"时机已经成熟了。此刻迪亚娜精心准备的浪漫故事像是一张无法挣脱的网，她要让这位大人物陷入其中，而这位大人物却注定像一个在基督教初期的新教徒倾听使徒宣讲使徒书信似的聆听王妃的故事。","The hour had come; Diane was now to entangle that great man in the inextricable meshes of a romance carefully prepared, to which he was fated to listen as the neophyte of early Christian times listened to the epistles of an apostle."
"“我的朋友，”王妃说道，“我的母亲现在仍住在于克塞尔。在我十七岁的时候，也就是一八一四年，母亲把我嫁给了德摩弗里纽斯先生（现在你知道我有多么老了吧），但是这并不是因为母亲对我的爱，而是因为母亲对他的爱。她是在向她唯一爱过的男人还债，因为他曾经给予了她幸福的时光。啊！你不必对这种可怕的婚姻阴谋感到震惊，这种事是经常发生的。许多女人都不太像母亲，更像是情人，尽管大多数的女人更容易扮演好母亲的角色，而非妻子。爱情和母性这两种情感在我们礼仪和风俗的影响之下得以发展，它们经常在女人心中展开竞争，当两者之间力量不对等时，势必有一方屈从；当两方力量相同时，就会造就出一些不同寻常的女人，从而成为我们女性的光荣。像你这种天才人物肯定能理解这些事情，尽管傻瓜会感到迷惑，但仍然是真实存在的；我还可以再进一步通过性格、性情、爱好和地位的不同来说明这类事情是有它存在的道理的。就拿我来说吧，忍受了二十多年的不幸、欺骗、诽谤，过了二十多年疲惫空虚的享乐生活，现在想拜倒在一个将会真心爱我到永远的男人脚下不是很自然的吗？然而，这样又会遭到世人的谴责。可是，我已经忍受了二十年的苦难，这或许是个很好的理由，让我趁还年轻的这短短几年，拥有一份神圣真诚的爱情。但是这种事情是不会发生的。我不会那么鲁莽地让我的天堂之梦破碎。我忍受着白天的酷暑和劳累，我完成了我的任务，我该赢得我的报酬。”","“My friend,” began Diane, “my mother, who still lives at Uxelles, married me in 1814, when I was seventeen years old (you see how old I am now!) to Monsieur de Maufrigneuse, not out of affection for me, but out of regard for him.She discharged her debt to the only man she had ever loved, for the happiness she had once received from him.Oh! you need not be astonished at so horrible a conspiracy; it frequently takes place.Many women are more lovers than mothers, though the majority are more mothers than wives.The two sentiments, love and motherhood, developed as they are by our manners and customs, often struggle together in the hearts of women; one or other must succumb when they are not of equal strength; when they are, they produce some exceptional women, the glory of our sex.A man of your genius must surely comprehend many things that bewilder fools but are none the less true; indeed I may go further and call them justifiable through difference of characters, temperaments, attachments, situations.I, for example, at this moment, after twenty years of misfortunes, of deceptions, of calumnies endured, and weary days and hollow pleasures, is it not natural that I should incline to fall at the feet of a man who would love me sincerely and forever?And yet, the world would condemn me.But twenty years of suffering might well excuse a few brief years which may still remain to me of youth given to a sacred and real love.This will not happen.I am not so rash as to sacrifice my hopes of heaven.I have borne the burden and heat of the day, I shall finish my course and win my recompense.”"
"“天使般的女人！”德阿泰兹心想。","“Angel!” thought d’Arthez."
"“不管怎样，我从没有怪过我的母亲；她不太了解我。那些过着像德于克塞尔公爵夫人生活的母亲都不怎么亲近自己的孩子。在结婚之前，我对这个世界见识太少了。你可以想象我是多么地单纯！我什么都不懂；所以根本就不能理解这场婚姻的原由是什么。　我有一笔可观的财产：每年六万法郎的森林地产收益，在尼维尔内省，是法国大革命时期忘记拍卖或是不能出售的一块地，雄伟的昂济城堡就在那儿。德摩弗里纽斯先生浑身是债。后来，我才懂得了什么是负债。然而，由于我不谙世事，根本就不知道负债对于我意味着什么；我所积攒下来的全部财产都替我丈夫还了债。我和他结婚的时候，德摩弗里纽斯先生四十八岁。婚后这些年对于我就像是战争的岁月对于军人那样漫长，感觉比实际的时间要长一倍。啊！我这十年过的是什么样的生活啊！有谁能体会我这个既可怜又受尽诽谤的小妇人的痛苦呢！每天被嫉妒自己女儿的母亲监视着！天哪！你们这些写剧本的人，永远也不会创作出这样悲惨的剧本。根据我对文学的粗浅了解，通常来说，悲剧就是一系列的行为、对话和动作，这所有急速地导向一个灾难性的结局，而现在我所说到的悲剧是正在进行中的灾难。就像雪崩一样，早晨会塌下来压住你，晚上又塌下来压住你，而紧接着的第二天将照旧塌下来压着你。当我现在对你提起那个我曾住过的阴冷的、暗无天日的洞穴时，仍感到浑身发冷。我曾经是多么可怜的小女孩啊！我在修道院长大，像一朵神秘的玫瑰花，对婚姻这桩事一无所知，发育得很慢。起初，我觉得自己很幸福，沐浴在温馨和睦的家庭氛围之中。现在说说我那可怜的孩子的降生吧，他简直就像我本人，对于我们的相似，你一定会感到非常吃惊吧？他的头发、眼睛、脸型、嘴巴、微笑的模样以及牙齿和我的都一模一样！他的出生对我而言真是一种安慰，初为人母的我格外高兴，我不再想着我的丈夫。再说，我丈夫也从没带给我什么快乐，也不会做一些讨我喜欢的好事；因为没什么其他快乐的事情，所以做母亲的快乐更加使我着迷。人们经常在我耳边嘀咕，一个母亲应该尊重自己。除此之外，少女也爱扮演‘母亲’的角色。我很自豪能拥有这朵美丽的花——因为乔治非常漂亮，我觉得简直是朵奇葩！除了我儿子之外，我什么也不管什么也不想，我和他生活在一起。我从不让保姆给他穿脱衣服。对于孩子多的母亲来说如此照顾孩子肯定会感到疲惫，而对我来说，却是一件快乐的事。尽管痛苦蒙住了我的眼睛，我毕竟不是个实实在在的傻子，三四年之后，我终于看到了光明。你能想象在一九一八年，我最后觉醒时的情景吗？如果纳坦时我们母女为原型写一出戏，《兄弟如仇》就是一出喜剧了。但是我挑战我的母亲、我的丈夫乃至整个世界，到处卖弄风情，引起了社会上的纷纷议论。天知道他们是如何议论我的啊！所以你可以看出来，我的朋友，那些被指控为与我有轻佻行为的男人竟然成了我用来报复敌人的匕首。因为心思全在复仇上，竟没有意识到或是感觉到这种行为使自己承受多大的伤害。本来天真得像个孩子，却被认为是个淫邪的女人，世界上最坏的女人，而我却毫不知情！世人真是愚蠢、盲目、无知；他们只会看破那些供他们娱乐以及满足他们恶毒心肠的秘密，而对于那些伟大的事情、高贵的事情，他们却用手紧紧地遮住眼睛避免看到。然而，回想起来，当时的我似乎有一种清白无辜却遭人诬蔑的愤慨态度和傲慢行为，这对于一名伟大的画家来说绝对是个好题材。我的暴风雨般的愤怒和轻蔑一定为许多舞会增加了不少光彩。已逝的诗情！只有在二十岁由于极端的愤怒才会激发出这样绝妙的诗篇。二十岁以后，我们就不再愤怒了，我们厌倦了，并且对于种种恶行我们也不觉得惊奇了，我们变得懦弱，胆小。然而，当时——噢！我走在了时代的前列！尽管我扮演着世界上最蠢之人的角色；我白担着罪名，却没从中得到过任何好处。但是我还是享受损害自己名誉的乐趣。这就是我的复仇！啊！我曾经玩了多少孩子似的鬼把戏啊！我曾跟着一位轻率的青年到了意大利，当他向我求爱时我甩了他。可是后来当我听说他因为我而犯了罪（他犯了弄虚作假骗取钱财之罪），我又急速地跑去救他。我母亲和我丈夫几乎不给我钱花，所以这一次，我去找国王求助。路易十八，这个没心肝的人竟然被我感动了，从他的私库里取出来十万法郎给了我。德埃斯格里尼侯爵——想必你在一些社交场合也见过他，他后来和一位富有的女人结了亲——为了我自投深渊，这下终于得救了。由于我的轻佻行为而导致的这场风波开始使我反省了。我意识到自己竟然成了我的报复行为的第一个牺牲品。我的母亲知道我不至于做出真正的伤风败俗的行为，因为她了解我的傲气，了解我是典型的德于克塞尔家的人，于是她开始意识到她对我的伤害，并为此感到恐惧。当时她已经五十二岁了，她离开了巴黎，回到了于克塞尔去生活。在那里，她用奉献为她犯的过错赎罪，向我表达着她的无限慈爱。母亲离开之后，我又和德摩弗里纽斯公爵先生单独地生活在了一起。噢！我的朋友，你们男人永远也不会了解一个养尊处优的老人是个什么样子。当一个习惯了世上女人对其阿谀奉承的人发现在自己的家里既听不到阿谀之言又缺少阿谀之人的时候，这还算是个什么家啊！他对一切都没有感觉！但还心怀嫉妒。我本想——当德摩弗里纽斯先生完全属于我的时候——我会努力做一个好妻子，然而这个讨厌的男人对我粗言恶语，我就对他极其厌恶。他把我当小孩子看待，无时无刻不把挫伤我的自尊心当作一种乐趣，并用他的经验来对我嘲讽打压，喜欢向我证明我是一个完全无知的人。他无时无刻不在伤害我。他做尽一切让我讨厌的事，以此给了我背叛他的权利；然而由于我想做善事的希望和渴望，竟然欺骗了自己好几年。我该告诉你让我做出更愚蠢的事的残忍议论吗？‘德摩弗里纽斯公爵夫人又回到她丈夫身边了。’世人都这么议论着。‘呸！把死人弄活也总算是一种胜利吧，现在她能做的也只有这些了。’我最好的朋友回答道，她还是我的亲戚呢，就是在她家里我有幸和你相遇。”","“After all, I have never blamed my mother; she knew little of me.Mothers who lead a life like that of the Duchesse d’Uxelles keep their children at a distance.I saw and knew nothing of the world until my marriage.You can judge of my innocence!I knew nothing; I was incapable of understanding the causes of my marriage.I had a fine fortune; sixty thousand francs a year in forests, which the Revolution overlooked (or had not been able to sell) in the Nivernais, with the noble chateau of d’Anzy.Monsieur de Maufrigneuse was steeped in debt.Later I learned what it was to have debts, but then I was too utterly ignorant of life to suspect my position; the money saved out of my fortune went to pacify my husband’s creditors.Monsieur de Maufrigneuse was forty-eight years of age when I married him; but those years were like military campaigns, they ought to count for twice what they were.Ah! what a life I led for ten years!If any one had known the suffering of this poor, calumniated little woman!To be watched by a mother jealous of her daughter!Heavens!You who make dramas, you will never invent anything as direful as that.Ordinarily, according to the little that I know of literature, a drama is a suite of actions, speeches, movements which hurry to a catastrophe; but what I speak of was a catastrophe in action.It was an avalanche fallen in the morning and falling again at night only to fall again the next day.I am cold now as I speak to you of that cavern without an opening, cold, sombre, in which I lived.I, poor little thing that I was!brought up in a convent like a mystic rose, knowing nothing of marriage, developing late, I was happy at first; I enjoyed the goodwill and harmony of our family.The birth of my poor boy, who is all me—you must have been struck by the likeness?my hair, my eyes, the shape of my face, my mouth, my smile, my teeth!—well, his birth was a relief to me; my thoughts were diverted by the first joys of maternity from my husband, who gave me no pleasure and did nothing for me that was kind or amiable; those joys were all the keener because I knew no others.It had been so often rung into my ears that a mother should respect herself.Besides, a young girl loves to play the mother.I was so proud of my flower—for Georges was beautiful, a miracle, I thought!I saw and thought of nothing but my son, I lived with my son.I never let his nurse dress or undress him.Such cares, so wearing to mothers who have a regiment of children, were all my pleasure.But after three or four years, as I was not an actual fool, light came to my eyes in spite of the pains taken to blindfold me.Can you see me at that final awakening, in 1819?The drama of ‘The Brothers at enmity’ is a rose-water tragedy beside that of a mother and daughter placed as we then were.But I braved them all, my mother, my husband, the world, by public coquetries which society talked of,—and heaven knows how it talked!You can see, my friend, how the men with whom I was accused of folly were to me the dagger with which to stab my enemies.Thinking only of my vengeance, I did not see or feel the wounds I was inflicting on myself.Innocent as a child, I was thought a wicked woman, the worst of women, and I knew nothing of it!The world is very foolish, very blind, very ignorant; it can penetrate no secrets but those which amuse it and serve its malice: noble things, great things, it puts its hand before its eyes to avoid seeing.But, as I look back, it seems to me that I had an attitude and aspect of indignant innocence, with movements of pride, which a great painter would have recognized.I must have enlivened many a ball with my tempests of anger and disdain.Lost poesy!such sublime poems are only made in the glowing indignation which seizes us at twenty.Later, we are wrathful no longer, we are too weary, vice no longer amazes us, we are cowards, we fear.But then—oh!I kept a great pace!For all that I played the silliest personage in the world; I was charged with crimes by which I never benefited.But I had such pleasure in compromising myself.That was my revenge!Ah! I have played many childish tricks!I went to Italy with a thoughtless youth, whom I crushed when he spoke to me of love, but later, when I heard that he was compromised on my account (he had committed a forgery to get money) I rushed to save him.My mother and husband kept me almost without means; but, this time, I went to the king.Louis XVIII., that man without a heart, was touched; he gave me a hundred thousand francs from his privy purse.The Marquis d’Esgrignon—you must have seen him in society for he ended by making a rich marriage—was saved from the abyss into which he had plunged for my sake.That adventure, caused by my own folly, led me to reflect.I saw that I myself was the first victim of my vengeance.My mother, who knew I was too proud, too d’Uxelles, to conduct myself really ill, began to see the harm that she had done me and was frightened by it.She was then fifty-two years of age; she left Paris and went to live at Uxelles.There she expiates her wrong-doing by a life of devotion and expresses the utmost affection for me.After her departure I was face to face, alone, with Monsieur de Maufrigneuse.Oh! my friend, you men can never know what an old man of gallantry can be.What a home is that of a man accustomed to the adulation of women of the world, when he finds neither incense nor censer in his own house!dead to all!and yet, perhaps for that very reason, jealous.I wished—when Monsieur de Maufrigneuse was wholly mine—I wished to be a good wife, but I found myself repulsed with the harshness of a soured spirit by a man who treated me like a child and took pleasure in humiliating my self-respect at every turn, in crushing me under the scorn of his experience, and in convicting me of total ignorance.He wounded me on all occasions.He did everything to make me detest him and to give me the right to betray him; but I was still the dupe of my own hope and of my desire to do right through several years.Shall I tell you the cruel saying that drove me to further follies?‘The Duchesse de Maufrigneuse has gone back to her husband,’ said the world.‘Bah! it is always a triumph to bring the dead to life; it is all she can now do,’ replied my best friend, a relation, she, at whose house I met you—”"
"“是德埃斯帕夫人！”达尼埃尔大声嚷道，同时做了一个惊恐的姿势。","“Madame d’Espard!” cried Daniel, with a gesture of horror."
"“噢！我已经原谅她了。并且，我觉得那些话非常俏皮，如果换作我的话，也许也会对那些像我一样单纯可怜的女人说出一些残忍的、带刺的警句来。”","“Oh! I have forgiven her.Besides, it was very witty; and I have myself made just as cruel epigrams on other poor women as innocent as myself.”"
"德阿泰兹再次吻了一下这位圣女的手，她刚刚把自己的母亲剁成碎片，接着又把德卡迪央亲王变成了奥赛罗，现在继续控诉自己的过错，这一切无非是让自己在这个天真伟大的人眼里显得圣洁点，因为不管是最愚蠢的女人还是最精明的女人都会不惜一切代价向情人证明自己的纯洁。","D’Arthez again kissed the hand of that saintly woman who, having hacked her mother in pieces, and turned the Prince de Cadignan into an Othello, now proceeded to accuse herself in order to appear in the eyes of that innocent great man as immaculate as the silliest or the wisest of women desire to seem at all costs to their lovers."
"“我的朋友，你肯定会理解，我重返社交界是为了找回激情，也可以这么说，是为了‘臭名昭著’。我觉得首先我必须独立。于是，我过起了奢侈浪费的生活。为了转移我的视线、为了忘记现实的生活，我纵情于虚假的享乐，我变得放荡，大肆炫耀，举行各种舞会，摆出王妃的架子，结果背了一身债。在家里，我经常在疲劳的酣睡中忘记了自己，第二天醒来仍然在俗世中纵情欢乐；然而，这场为逃避现实生活的闹剧却让我花光了所有的财产。一八三零年革命爆发，正是那个时候，我结束了自己天方夜谭式的生活，遇到了我所梦想经历的最纯洁最神圣的爱情（我说的都是真心话）。当一个女人的心灵经历了各种各样的磨难和事故，到了突然知道自己曾经受骗的年龄段时，当她见到别的女人拥有幸福的爱情时，自身渴望这样的爱情难道不是很自然的事吗？啊！米歇尔·克里斯蒂安为什么会这么毕恭毕敬呢？他为什么不试着来找我呢？这对我来说又是一种嘲弄！但又有什么办法呢？随着自己的堕落，我失去了所有的东西，甚至连幻想都没有了；各种各样的事情我都尝试过，唯独那个果实，但现在我也没有啃它的劲头了。是的，就是在我必须要离开这个社会的那一刻，我发现自己已经对它毫无留恋。这似乎是神的旨意，难道不是吗？就像在我们临死之前那种麻木的状态。”（她做了个虔诚的姿势。）“一切的一切都好像为我安排好了。”她继续说道，“而王朝的覆灭以及它的废墟正好可以用来帮助我埋葬自己。不过我的儿子给了我很多安慰。所有的失意情绪都被母爱所取代了。世人对于我的隐退感到非常惊讶，但对我而言，隐退却给我带来了平静的生活。啊！你要知道，站在你面前的这个可怜的人在这个小地方是多么幸福啊。我把一切都奉献给我的儿子，我忘记了过去那些欢乐，而且我也必须忘记。是的，希望消逝了。今天对于所有的一切我都感到恐惧，想到我曾遇到过的欺骗和苦难，我连最真诚的感情，最纯洁、最名副其实的爱情也会拒绝，也就不足为怪了。所有的一切都很可怕，难道不是吗？然而，我所告诉你的正是许多女人都经历过的。”","“You will readily understand, my friend, that I returned to society for the purpose of excitement and I may say of notoriety.I felt that I must conquer my independence.I led a life of dissipation.To divert my mind, to forget my real life in fictitious enjoyments I was gay, I shone, I gave fetes, I played the princess, and I ran in debt.At home I could forget myself in the sleep of weariness, able to rise the next day gay, and frivolous for the world; but in that sad struggle to escape my real life I wasted my fortune.The revolution of 1830 came; it came at the very moment when I had met, at the end of that Arabian Nights’ life, a pure and sacred love which (I desire to be honest) I had longed to know.Was it not natural in a woman whose heart, repressed by many causes and accidents, was awakening at an age when a woman feels herself cheated if she has never known, like the women she sees about her, a happy love?Ah! why was Michel Chrestien so respectful?Why did he not seek to meet me?There again was another mockery!But what of that?in falling, I have lost everything; I have no illusions left; I had tasted of all things except the one fruit for which I have no longer teeth.Yes, I found myself disenchanted with the world at the very moment when I was forced to leave it.Providential, was it not?like all those strange insensibilities which prepare us for death” (she made a gesture full of pious unction).“All things served me then,” she continued; “the disasters of the monarchy and its ruin helped me to bury myself.My son consoles me for much.Maternal love takes the place of all frustrated feelings.The world is surprised at my retirement, but to me it has brought peace.Ah! if you knew how happy the poor creature before you is in this little place.In sacrificing all to my son I forget to think of joys of which I am and ever must be ignorant.Yes, hope has flown, I now fear everything; no doubt I should repulse the truest sentiment, the purest and most veritable love, in memory of the deceptions and the miseries of my life.It is all horrible, is it not?and yet, what I have told you is the history of many women.”"
"最后几句话是用一种轻松愉快的口吻说的，这样就又唤回了这个女人本来的风姿。德阿泰兹目瞪口呆。在他眼中，与这些上流社会上的男男女女相比，那些因杀人、因严重的盗窃、因对票据作弊而被送进监狱的罪犯可以算是圣人了。这首在谎言武库中铸造的、在巴黎的斯提克斯河中深深浸淫过的恶毒的哀歌，奔腾着流进了他的耳朵里，那种真实的音调是无法模拟的。这位严肃的作家对这位可敬的女人默默地注视了几分钟：她倚靠在沙发上，两手从扶手上自然下垂，像是两滴从美丽的玫瑰花瓣上滴落的露珠。说出自己心中的秘密之后，她显得如此疲惫，好像在她叙述自己经历时又重新感受了一次曾经的痛苦生活——总之，她现在是一位忧郁的天使。　","The last few words were said in a tone of easy pleasantry which recalled the presence of the woman of the world.D’Arthez was dumbfounded.In his eyes convicts sent to the galleys for murder, or aggravated robbery, or for putting a wrong name to checks, were saints compared to the men and women of society.This atrocious elegy, forged in the arsenal of lies, and steeped in the waters of the Parisian Styx, had been poured into his ears with the inimitable accent of truth.The grave author contemplated for a moment that adorable woman lying back in her easy-chair, her two hands pendant from its arms like dewdrops from a rose-leaf, overcome by her own revelation, living over again the sorrows of her life as she told them—in short an angel of melancholy."
"“你来评判吧。”她哭喊着，突然跃起，举起一只手，眼睛里闪着光，是所谓的二十年的贞洁在闪耀，“你来评判一下像米歇尔这种人的爱会给我留下什么样的印象啊。然而，也许是命运的捉弄——或者是上帝的安排吗？——他死了，为了救一个人而死，你猜是为了救谁？是德卡迪央先生。现在你还会好奇我为什么陷入沉思吗？”","“And judge,” she cried, suddenly lifting herself with a spring and raising her hand, while lightning flashed from eyes where twenty chaste years shone—“judge of the impression the love of a man like Michel must have made upon me.But by some irony of fate—or was it the hand of God?—well, he died; died in saving the life of, whom do you suppose?of Monsieur de Cadignan.Are you now surprised to find me thoughtful?”"
"这是最后的一击。可怜的德阿泰兹再也撑不住了。他跪了下来，把头埋在迪亚娜的手中，眼泪缓缓地流了下来，就像天使洒下的泪水——如果天使也会哭泣的话。由于达尼埃尔那种屈膝的姿势，德卡迪央王妃可以毫无顾忌地让嘴角挂上一丝狡猾的胜利微笑，就像是猴子耍了个鬼把戏之后的微笑——如果猴子也会笑的话。","This was the last drop; poor d’Arthez could bear no more.He fell upon his knees, and laid his head on Diane’s hand, weeping soft tears such as the angels shed,—if angels weep.As Daniel was in that bent posture, Madame de Cadignan could safely let a malicious smile of triumph flicker on her lips, a smile such as the monkeys wear after playing a sly trick—if monkeys smile."
"“哈！我终于俘获他了。”她想道。的确，她把他牢牢地抓住了。","“Ah! I have him,” thought she; and, indeed, she had him fast."
"“可是，你是——”他抬起那英俊的头，用充满爱意的眼神看着她说道。","“But you are—” he said, raising his fine head and looking at her with eyes of love."
"“是圣女，也是殉道士。”她微笑着回答，笑这句老话有点庸俗。然而，她那饱含痛苦和快乐的微笑却赋予了它一个新鲜的意义。“如果你看见我在笑，”她继续说道，“那是因为我正在想着那位世人自认为很了解的王妃，那位德摩弗里纽斯公爵夫人。人们把德马尔赛、那位臭名昭著的政治扒手德特拉伊、那个小傻瓜德埃斯格里尼、拉斯蒂涅、吕邦泼雷都说成是她的情人，还有大使们、部长们、俄国将军们，天知道还有谁啊！整个欧洲吧！他们对那本我命人制作的画册说长道短，认定凡是爱慕我的人都是我的朋友。啊！太可怕了！我想知道为什么我要让一个个的男人都拜倒在我的脚下！我应该蔑视他们，这才是我的信仰！","“Virgin and martyr,” she replied, smiling at the commonness of that hackneyed expression, but giving it a freshness of meaning by her smile, so full of painful gayety.“If I laugh,” she continued, “it is that I am thinking of that princess whom the world thinks it knows, that Duchesse de Maufrigneuse to whom it gives as lovers de Marsay, that infamous de Trailles (a political cutthroat), and that little fool of a d’Esgrignon, and Rastignac, Rubempre, ambassadors, ministers, Russian generals, heaven knows who! all Europe!They have gossiped about that album which I ordered made, believing that those who admired me were my friends.Ah! it is frightful!I wonder that I allow a man at my feet!Despise them all, THAT should be my religion.”"
"她站起来，走到窗户边，步态是如此优雅大方。","She rose and went to the window with a gait and bearing magnificent in motifs."
"德阿泰兹仍然坐在他刚才坐的矮靠椅上，不敢跟随王妃。但是他看着她，听到了她擤鼻子的声音。哪有王妃擤鼻子的啊？不过迪亚娜会用尽一切办法来显示她的多愁善感。德阿泰兹相信他的天使哭了，于是快速地跑到她身边，搂住她的腰，把她紧紧地贴在自己的心上。","D’Arthez remained on the low seat to which he had returned not daring to follow the princess; but he looked at her; he heard her blowing her nose.Was there ever a princess who blew her nose?but Diane attempted the impossible to convey an idea of her sensibility.D’Arthez believed his angel was in tears; he rushed to her side, took her round the waist, and pressed her to his heart."
"“不，不，放开我！”她用微弱的声音喃喃地说道，“我的疑心太重了，对别人没什么好处。让我重新开始正常的生活，不是一个男人所能做到的。”","“No, no, leave me!” she murmured in a feeble voice.“I have too many doubts to be good for anything.To reconcile me with life is a task beyond the powers of any man.”"
"“迪亚娜！我将用我的爱来弥补你曾失去的全部生活。”","“Diane!I will love you for your whole lost life.”"
"“不，不要跟我这么说。”她说道，“此时此刻我在发抖，我很惭愧，好像我犯了最不可饶恕的罪似的。”","“No; don’t speak to me thus,” she answered.“At this moment I tremble, I am ashamed as though I had committed the greatest sins.”"
"此时的她像完全回到了小女孩时的天真无邪，然而又显示出一位王妃的威严、伟大和高贵的风度。很难描述出这些花招的效果，她的手段如此巧妙，以至于让像德阿泰兹这么纯洁、这么诚实的人都感觉那是世界上最纯粹的事实。这位伟大的作家此刻仍然一声不吭，心里充满了敬慕，被动地站在窗前，等待着王妃的一句话，而王妃却在等待着一个吻，可是对他来说，王妃实在是太神圣了啊。王妃感到身上有点冷，于是又回到她的沙发上，她的脚都冻僵了。","She was now entirely restored to the innocence of little girls, and yet her bearing was august, grand, noble as that of a queen.It is impossible to describe the effect of these manoeuvres, so clever that they acted like the purest truth on a soul as fresh and honest as that of d’Arthez.The great author remained dumb with admiration, passive beside her in the recess of that window awaiting a word, while the princess awaited a kiss; but she was far too sacred to him for that.Feeling cold, the princess returned to her easy-chair; her feet were frozen."
"“这还得需要很长的时间。”她看着达尼埃尔那高贵的额头和脑袋自言自语道。","“It will take a long time,” she said to herself, looking at Daniel’s noble brow and head."
"“这是一个女人吗？”这个对人类心灵具有深刻洞察力的专家心里想着，“我该怎么对待她呢？”","“Is this a woman?” thought that profound observer of human nature.“How ought I to treat her?”"
"他们就这样互相说着些蠢话一直说到清晨两点钟，不过，像王妃这样的天才女人懂得怎样使这些蠢话变得讨人喜欢。迪亚娜故意说自己太衰弱、太老、太过时了；而德阿泰兹就反驳她，说她的皮肤是最细嫩、摸起来最柔软、看起来最白皙、闻起来最馨香的，她还年轻，正值如花似锦的年龄，她怎么还能那样想呢？（虽然他说的这些王妃心里也深信不疑。）他们就这样讨论着，从这种美谈到那种美，从这个细节谈到那个细节，还时不时地说着：“啊！你是这样想的吗？”——“你疯了吗！”——“这是希望，这是幻想！”——“不久你就会看出我的真面目了。”——“我都快四十岁了。一个男人怎么会爱一个年龄这么大的老女人呢？”","Until two o’clock in the morning they spent their time in saying to each other the silly things that women of genius, like the princess, know how to make adorable.Diane pretended to be too worn, too old, too faded; D’Arthez proved to her (facts of which she was well convinced) that her skin was the most delicate, the softest to the touch, the whitest to the eye, the most fragrant; she was young and in her bloom, how could she think otherwise?Thus they disputed, beauty by beauty, detail by detail with many: “Oh!do you think so?”—“You are beside yourself!”—“It is hope, it is fancy!”—“You will soon see me as I am.”—“I am almost forty years of age.Can a man love so old a woman?”"
"此刻德阿泰兹雄辩滔滔，却又鲁莽得像个中学生，言辞中充满了许多夸张的形容词。当王妃听到这位聪明机智的作家像个多情的少尉似的说一些蠢话时，她做出充满感情、全神贯注倾听的样子。可是心中却在暗笑。","D’Arthez responded with impetuous and school-boy eloquence, larded with exaggerated epithets.When the princess heard this wise and witty writer talking the nonsense of an amorous sub-lieutenant she listened with an absorbed air and much sensibility; but she laughed in her sleeve."
"当德阿泰兹走在大街上时，他自问自己是否太过于恭敬了。他把刚刚那场奇怪的秘密谈话又重新在脑子里回忆了一下。当然，这里的叙述有所删节，因为要想把所有甜蜜的、丰富的内容以及谈话中的姿态全部记录下来，恐怕得需要一本书。尽管这位如此天真、如此深沉的人的记忆很清晰，但还是被故事本身的淳朴、深刻和王妃的语调弄得模糊了。","When d’Arthez was in the street, he asked himself whether he might not have been rather less respectful.He went over in memory those strange confidences—which have, naturally, been much abridged here, for they needed a volume to convey their mellifluous abundance and the graces which accompanied them.The retrospective perspicacity of this man, so natural, so profound, was baffled by the candor of that tale and its poignancy, and by the tones of the princess."
"“是真的。”他无法入睡，心里想，“社会上确实有像那样的悲剧。社会用鲜花般的优雅，粉饰后的流言和机智的谎言来掩盖这类可怕的悲剧。我们作家的创作怎么也比不过现实啊。可怜的迪亚娜！米歇尔曾经看穿了这个谜团，他曾说过坚冰之下便是火山！毕安训和拉斯蒂涅说得对，当一个男人把理想的伟大和激情的乐趣结合起来，爱上一个风度优雅、才智非凡、温柔体贴的女子，那应该是无以言表的幸福。”","“It is true,” he said to himself, being unable to sleep, “there are such dramas as that in society.Society covers great horrors with the flowers of its elegance, the embroidery of its gossip, the wit of its lies.We writers invent no more than the truth.Poor Diane!Michel had penetrated that enigma; he said that beneath her covering of ice there lay volcanoes!Bianchon and Rastignac were right; when a man can join the grandeurs of the ideal and the enjoyments of human passion in loving a woman of perfect manners, of intellect, of delicacy, it must be happiness beyond words.”"
"就这样想着，他测量了一下自己爱情的深度，发现它是无限的。","So thinking, he sounded the love that was in him and found it infinite."
"第五章 信仰的审判","CHAPTER V A TRIAL OF FAITH"
"第二天，大约是下午两点钟，德埃斯巴夫人因为有一个多月没见到王妃并且也没有听到关于她的任何消息，便在极度的好奇心驱使下来看望她。这两条狡猾的水蛇在见面后的最初半个小时的谈话是最有趣不过了。","The next day, about two in the afternoon, Madame d’Espard, who had seen and heard nothing of the princess for more than a month, went to see her under the impulse of extreme curiosity.Nothing was ever more amusing of its kind than the conversation of these two crafty adders during the first half-hour of this visit."
"迪亚娜·德于克塞尔非常谨慎地像避免穿一件黄色的袍子似的避免谈起德阿泰兹。而侯爵夫人却像沙漠里的游牧人围着行商队似的，老在这个话题上兜圈子。迪亚娜觉得有趣，侯爵夫人却感到气愤。迪亚娜在等待，她想像猎人利用猎狗一样利用她的朋友。在这两个当代社会中赫赫有名的女人中，一个要比另一个强得多。王妃要比侯爵夫人略胜一筹，对此，侯爵夫人内心非常清楚。也许，这就是她们亲密无间的秘密所在。较弱的一方蜷缩在忠诚的面具下，等待着时机的到来，弱者们都懂得必须长期地耐心等待，只有等到时机的到来才能扑向强者的喉咙，用力地咬一下，留下痛快的印记。迪亚娜非常明白这一点，而世人却被两位好友表面上的亲密所欺骗了。","Diane d’Uxelles cautiously avoided, as she would the wearing of a yellow gown, all mention of d’Arthez.The marquise circled round and round that topic like a Bedouin round a caravan.Diane amused herself; the marquise fumed.Diane waited; she intended to utilize her friend and use her in the chase.Of these two women, both so celebrated in the social world, one was far stronger than the other.The princess rose by a head above the marquise, and the marquise was inwardly conscious of that superiority.In this, perhaps, lay the secret of their intimacy.The weaker of the two crouched low in her false attachment, watching for the hour, long awaited by feeble beings, of springing at the throat of the stronger and leaving the mark of a joyful bite.Diane saw clear; but the world was the dupe of the wile caresses of the two friends."
"当王妃发现她的朋友嘴边露出的询问神情，立即说道：","The instant that the princess perceived a direct question on the lips of her friend, she said:—"
"“啊！亲爱的，我欠了你一个人情啊，你给了我一个近乎完美的、巨大的、无限的、如在天堂般的幸福啊。”","“Ah! dearest, I owe you a most complete, immense, infinite, celestial happiness.”"
"“你这是什么意思啊？”","“What can you mean?”"
"“难道你忘了三个月前，在这个小花园里，我们坐在长凳上，沐浴着阳光，在茉莉花丛下所反复思考过的问题吗？","“Have you forgotten what we ruminated three months ago in the little garden, sitting on a bench in the sun, under the jasmine?"
"啊！除了天才男人之外，谁都不懂得如何去爱！用阿尔巴公爵对凯瑟琳·德梅迪契所说的话来形容我高尚的达尼埃尔·德阿泰兹，就是‘一条鲑鱼的头胜过所有青蛙的头。’”","Ah! there are none but men of genius who know how to love!I apply to my grand Daniel d’Arthez the Duke of Alba’s saying to Catherine de’ Medici: ‘The head of a single salmon is worth all the frogs in the world.’”"
"“难怪我好久没有见到你们了呢。”德埃斯巴夫人说道。","“I am not surprised that I no longer see you,” said Madame d’Espard."
"“我的天使，请答应我，如果你见到他，不要对他提起关于我的任何事情。”王妃拿起朋友的手说道，“哦！我现在非常幸福！幸福到难以用语言描述。但是你也知道的，在现在这个社会，一句话，甚至仅仅是一个玩笑就能造成很大的影响。一句话都可以杀死人，因为人们在这句简单的句子里注入了一些毒液！啊！你是不知道我是多么希望你也能遇到一种像这样的爱情啊！像我们这把年纪的女人，如果能在我们的青春结束之前，沉睡在一种热情、纯洁、忠诚、完美、专一的爱情之中，尤其是在我们苦苦找寻之后，那真算是一件又甜美又珍贵的胜利啊！”","“Promise me, if you meet him, not to say to him one word about me, my angel,” said the princess, taking her friend’s hand.“I am happy, oh!happy beyond all expression; but you know that in society a word, a mere jest can do much harm.One speech can kill, for they put such venom into a single sentence!Ah! if you knew how I long that you might meet with a love like this!Yes, it is a sweet, a precious triumph for women like ourselves to end our woman’s life in this way; to rest in an ardent, pure, devoted, complete and absolute love; above all, when we have sought it long.”"
"“为什么你会要求我对我最好的朋友忠诚呢？”德埃斯巴夫人问道，“难道你认为我会在你背后搞鬼吗？”","“Why do you ask me to be faithful to my dearest friend?” said Madame d’Espard.“Do you think me capable of playing you some villainous trick?”"
"“当一个女人拥有这么一种财富的时候，她是那么怕失去它，所以就很自然地会产生一种恐惧的思想。我知道，我很荒唐，请宽恕我吧，亲爱的。”","“When a woman possesses such a treasure the fear of losing it is so strong that it naturally inspires a feeling of terror.I am absurd, I know; forgive me, dear.”"
"过了一会儿，侯爵夫人走了。把她送走后，王妃自言自语道：","A few moments later the marquise departed; as she watched her go the princess said to herself:—"
"“她会怎么对付我呢！不过，为了免去她从这儿把达尼埃尔拉走的麻烦，我会亲自把他送上门去。”","“How she will pluck me!But to save her the trouble of trying to get Daniel away from here I’ll send him to her.”"
"下午三点钟刚过，德阿泰兹来了。当他正滔滔不绝地谈论着一些有趣的话题的时候，王妃突然打断了他，把手放到他的胳膊上。","At three o’clock, or a few moments after, d’Arthez arrived.In the midst of some interesting topic on which he was discoursing eloquently, the princess suddenly cut him short by laying her hand on his arm."
"“请原谅，我亲爱的朋友，”她就这样打断了他，“我怕我会忘了这件事，虽然看起来微不足道，可也许非常重要。自从在德埃斯巴夫人那里我与你相遇的那幸福的一天起，你至今还没有拜访过她。你就到她家去一趟吧，不是为了你，也不是出于礼貌，而是为了我。你也许已经使她成了我的敌人，如果哪天她发现自从她的夜宴之后你就很少离开过我家。再说，我的朋友，我也不希望你放弃你的社交圈子，忽略你的事业和著作。否则，我又会遭到一些千奇百怪的诽谤。他们什么话说不出来啊？什么我控制住你啦、你被我给迷住啦、我害怕和别人比啦、因为知道是最后一次的胜利而紧紧抓住我的战胜品不放啦！谁会知道你是我的朋友、我唯一的朋友呢？如果你真地爱我，就像你所说的那样，你就应该让世人知道我们纯粹是兄妹关系——现在你可以继续往下谈了。”","“Pardon me, my dear friend,” she said, interrupting him, “but I fear I may forget a thing which seems a mere trifle but may be of great importance.You have not set foot in Madame d’Espard’s salon since the ever-blessed day when I met you there.Pray go at once; not for your sake, nor by way of politeness, but for me.You may already have made her an enemy of mine, if by chance she has discovered that since her dinner you have scarcely left my house.Besides, my friend, I don’t like to see you dropping your connection with society, and neglecting your occupations and your work.I should again be strangely calumniated.What would the world say?That I held you in leading-strings, absorbed you, feared comparisons, and clung to my conquest knowing it to be my last!Who will know that you are my friend, my only friend?If you love me indeed, as you say you love me, you will make the world believe that we are purely and simply brother and sister—Go on with what you were saying.”"
"德阿泰兹性情温柔，又受到高贵品德的影响，便服从了这一要求，第二天便去拜访德埃斯巴夫人。夫人接见了他，向他施展出她的迷人魅力。侯爵夫人非常谨慎小心，只字不提王妃，不过，她请他改天来她家吃晚饭。","In his armor of tenderness, riveted by the knowledge of so many splendid virtues, d’Arthez obeyed this behest on the following day and went to see Madame d’Espard, who received him with charming coquetry.The marquise took very good care not to say a single word to him about the princess, but she asked him to dinner on a coming day."
"就在这一天，德阿泰兹见到了很多宾客。侯爵夫人邀请了拉斯蒂涅、布隆代、阿瞿达-潘托侯爵、马克西姆·德特拉伊侯爵、德埃斯格里尼侯爵、两兄弟旺德奈斯、杜·蒂耶（巴黎最富有的银行家之一）、德纽沁根男爵、拉乌尔·纳坦、迪德莱夫人（大使馆中最不讲信用的两名随员）以及德埃斯巴骑士（他是这次聚会中最诡计多端的人，她嫂子的信条主要都是拜他所赐）。","On this occasion d’Arthez found a numerous company.The marquise had invited Rastignac, Blondet, the Marquis d’Ajuda-Pinto, Maxime de Trailles, the Marquis d’Esgrignon, the two brothers Vandenesse, du Tillet, one of the richest bankers in Paris, the Baron de Nucingen, Raoul Nathan, Lady Dudley, two very treacherous secretaries of embassies and the Chevalier d’Espard, the wiliest person in this assemblage and the chief instigator of his sister-in-law’s policy."
"晚宴开始的时候，马克西姆·德特拉伊转向德阿泰兹，微笑着说道：","When dinner was well under way, Maxime de Trailles turned to d’Arthez and said smiling:—"
"“你经常见到德卡迪央王妃，是吧？”","“You see a great deal, don’t you, of the Princesse de Cadignan?”"
"德阿泰兹草草点了一下头作为答复。马克西姆·德特拉伊是这个社会的“亡命之徒”，没有信仰、无法无天、什么事情都干得出来，使那些信任他的女人遭遇破产，驱使她们用抵押自己首饰的钱供他花销。然而，这些行为却被一层光彩的外表所掩饰，因为他有优雅的举止和魔鬼般聪明的头脑。所有认识他的人对他既蔑视又害怕，然而没有一个人敢得罪他，在他面前只会显出一副最客气的模样，他自己却一点自知之明都没有，也许他已经接受了这种虚伪的形式并和大家一起虚伪。多亏了德马尔赛伯爵的提拔，他已经爬到了他能力所能及的最高位置。德马尔赛很早就认识马克西姆了，断定他能完成自己交给他的某些秘密任务和外交任务，他果然也完成得非常出色。德阿泰兹参与一些政治活动已经有些日子了，所以对此人非常了解，只有他有足够的胆量和高尚的品格敢于大声说出别人只敢心里想想或是小声嘀咕的话。","To this question d’Arthez responded by curtly nodding his head.Maxime de Trailles was a “bravo” of the social order, without faith or law, capable of everything, ruining the women who trusted him, compelling them to pawn their diamonds to give him money, but covering this conduct with a brilliant varnish; a man of charming manners and satanic mind.He inspired all who knew him with equal contempt and fear; but as no one was bold enough to show him any sentiments but those of the utmost courtesy he saw nothing of this public opinion, or else he accepted and shared the general dissimulation.He owed to the Comte de Marsay the greatest degree of elevation to which he could attain.De Marsay, whose knowledge of Maxime was of long-standing, judged him capable of fulfilling certain secret and diplomatic functions which he confided to him and of which de Trailles acquitted himself admirably.D’Arthez had for some time past mingled sufficiently in political matters to know the man for what he was, and he alone had sufficient strength and height of character to express aloud what others thought or said in a whisper."
"“是不是因为她，你才对议院漠不关心的呢？”德纽沁根男爵用他那德国口音问道。","“Is it for her that you neglect the Chamber?” asked Baron de Nucingen in his German accent."
"“啊！王妃是那些最危险的女人之一，男人们一旦碰到她准会倒霉。我那不幸的婚姻就是她造成的。”德埃斯格里尼侯爵大声叫道。","“Ah! the princess is one of the most dangerous women a man can have anything to do with.I owe to her the miseries of my marriage,” exclaimed the Marquis d’Esgrignon."
"“危险的女人？”德埃斯巴夫人说道，“不要这么说我最好的朋友。我从未看到或是听到过王妃的任何行为不是出自其最高尚的情感。”","“Dangerous?” said Madame d’Espard.“Don’t speak so of my nearest friend.I have never seen or known anything in the princess that did not seem to come from the noblest sentiments.”"
"“让我们听听侯爵怎么说的吧。”拉斯蒂涅嚷道，“当一个人被一匹漂亮的马甩下来的时候，他就觉得它有了缺陷并把它卖掉。”","“Let the marquis say what he thinks,” cried Rastignac.“When a man has been thrown by a fine horse he thinks it has vices and he sells it.”"
"听到这番刺激性的话，德埃斯格里尼侯爵看着德阿泰兹说道：","Piqued by these words, the Marquis d’Esgrignon looked at d’Arthez and said:—"
"“我相信，先生和王妃的关系没有达到影响我们正常谈论她的程度吧？”","“Monsieur is not, I trust, on such terms with the princess that we cannot speak freely of her?”"
"德阿泰兹保持沉默。德埃斯格里尼是个聪明之人，他明白了拉斯蒂涅的意思，于是对王妃进行了辩护性的描述，从而使整个宴席都活跃了起来。因为这一个玩笑的实在意义对德阿泰兹来说太晦涩了，于是他便转向邻座的德蒙科尔内夫人，小声询问这个玩笑到底是什么意思。","D’Arthez kept silence.D’Esgrignon, who was not wanting in cleverness, replied to Rastignac’s speech with an apologetic portrait of the princess, which put the whole table in good humor.As the jest was extremely obscure to d’Arthez he leaned towards his neighbor, Madame de Montcornet, and asked her, in a whisper, what it meant."
"“看来你对王妃的看法很好，从这点就得出你从未受到过王妃的宠爱了，不过，据说所有其他在座的宾客都曾受过她的宠爱。”","“Excepting yourself—judging by the excellent opinion you seem to have of the princess—all the other guests are said to have been in her good graces.”"
"“我敢向你保证，这种说法肯定是不正确的。”达尼埃尔说道。","“I can assure you that such an accusation is absolutely false,” said Daniel."
"“可是，德埃斯格里尼先生就是个很好的例子，他是阿朗松的贵族，十二年前，为了王妃，他倾家荡产了，并且为了她，如果确有此事的话，险些被送上断头台。”","“And yet, here is Monsieur d’Esgrignon of an old family of Alencon, who completely ruined himself for her some twelve years ago, and, if all is true, came very near going to the scaffold.”"
"“我知道那件事的来龙去脉。”德阿泰兹说，“德卡迪央夫人曾去阿朗松把德埃斯格里尼先生从巡回法庭中救了出来，而今天他是怎么样来报答她的！”","“I know the particulars of that affair,” said d’Arthez.“Madame de Cadignan went to Alencon to save Monsieur d’Esgrignon from a trial before the court of assizes; and this is how he rewards her today!”"
"德蒙科尔内夫人又惊讶又好奇地望着德阿泰兹，她都傻了，接着，她转眼望向德埃斯巴夫人，那眼神好像是在说：“他已经着了魔了！”","Madame de Montcornet looked at d’Arthez with a surprise and curiosity that were almost stupid, then she turned her eyes on Madame d’Espard with a look which seemed to say: “He is bewitched!”"
"在这次简短的谈话中，德卡迪央受到了德埃斯巴夫人的保护，而这种保护就像是避雷针的作用，引来了雷电。德阿泰兹再次参与大家的谈话时，马克西姆·德特拉伊正说着：","During this short conversation Madame de Cadignan was protected by Madame d’Espard, whose protection was like that of the lightning-rod which draws the flash.When d’Arthez returned to the general conversation Maxime de Trailles was saying:—"
"“对迪亚娜来说，堕落并不是后果而是根源，也许堕落是因为她那美妙的天性，她从不无中生有，也从不贪图什么，她展现在你面前的只有那最高雅的举止，作为一段最天真自然的爱情的灵感，想不相信她都不可能。”","“With Diane, depravity is not an effect but a cause; perhaps she owes that cause to her exquisite nature; she doesn’t invent, she makes no effort, she offers you the choicest refinements as the inspiration of a spontaneous and naive love; and it is absolutely impossible not to believe her.”"
"这番话似乎是特意为德阿泰兹这种人准备的，控诉得如此精炼，看起来大家都把它当作总结陈词了。谁都不再提王妃了，王妃就这样被消灭了。德阿泰兹用一种讥讽的神态先后看了看德特拉伊和德埃斯格里尼，然后说道：","This speech, which seemed to have been prepared for a man of d’Arthez’s stamp, was so tremendous an arraignment that the company appeared to accept it as a conclusion.No one said more; the princess was crushed.D’Arthez looked straight at de Trailles and then at d’Esgrignon with a sarcastic air, and said:—"
"“那个女人最大的错误就是她老是跟在男人们的后面。她像男人似的挥霍着遗产，她迫使她的情人们都成了高利贷者，她吃掉嫁资，她使孤儿们倾家荡产，她诱使别人犯罪，甚至她自己也犯过；但是——”","“The greatest fault of that woman is that she has followed in the wake of men.She squanders patrimonies as they do; she drives her lovers to usurers; she pockets “dots”; she ruins orphans; she inspires, possibly she commits, crimes, but—”"
"德阿泰兹的此番话主要是对刚才那两位的回应，这两位人物从未听到过如此简练明了的言语。在听到“但是”这个词时，整个宴席上的人都惊呆了，每个人都举着叉子静止不动了，他们的眼睛一会儿注视着这位勇敢的作家，一会儿又转向对王妃出言不逊的人，大家都在这场可怕的沉默中等待着他的结论。","Never had the two men, whom d’Arthez was chiefly addressing, listened to such plain talk.At that BUT the whole table was startled, every one paused, fork in air, their eyes fixed alternately on the brave author and on the assailants of the princess, awaiting the conclusion of that horrible silence."
"“但是，”德阿泰兹用一种漫不经心的嘲讽口气说道，“与男人们比起来，德卡迪央王妃夫人有一大优点，那就是：当人们为了她而陷入危险时，她会挺身而出援救他们，而且不说任何人的坏话。芸芸众生之中，为什么就不应该有一个女人玩弄男人，就像男人玩弄女人那样？为什么女性不能时不时地也来报复下男性呢？”","“But,” said d’Arthez, with sarcastic airiness, “Madame la Princesse de Cadignan has one advantage over men: when they have put themselves in danger for her sake, she saves them, and says no harm of any one.Among the multitude, why shouldn’t there be one woman who amuses herself with men as men amuse themselves with women?Why not allow the fair sex to take, from time to time, its revenge?”"
"“天才就是比智慧厉害。”布隆代对纳坦说道。","“Genius is stronger than wit,” said Blondet to Nathan."
"这一串带有讽刺意味的话的确像是拿炮兵的大炮对付步兵的排枪。开始用咖啡的时候，布隆代和纳坦殷勤地走到德阿泰兹面前致意，他们那种殷勤劲儿谁都不敢去模仿，因为在座的各位都很矛盾，他们都不想因为对德阿泰兹的钦佩而与两位强大的人物为敌。","This broadside of sarcasms was in fact the discharge of a battery of cannons against a platoon of musketry.When coffee was served, Blondet and Nathan went up to d’Arthez with an eagerness no one else dared to imitate, so unable were the rest of the company to show the admiration his conduct inspired from the fear of making two powerful enemies."
"“我们很早就知道你的性格和你的才能是同样伟大的。”布隆代说，“你刚才的行为，已经不是一个凡人所能做到的，你简直是一位天神。没有被感情或想象力所左右，也没有为自己心爱的女人辩护，这使得希望你这么做的人扑了个空，否则，这些对你的文学成就嫉妒得要死的人就会得逞了——啊！请允许我这么说吧，这是私人外交的顶峰。”","“This is not the first time we have seen that your character equals your talent in grandeur,” said Blondet.“You behaved just now more like a demi-god than a man.Not to have been carried away by your heart or your imagination, not to have taken up the defence of a beloved woman—a fault they were enticing you to commit, because it would have given those men of society eaten up with jealousy of your literary fame a triumph over you—ah!give me leave to say you have attained the height of private statesmanship.”"
"“是的，你是一位政治家。”纳坦说，“这简直是妙极了，因为要想既能为一个女人报仇而又能不替她辩护，实在是一件困难的事。”","“Yes, you are a statesman,” said Nathan.“It is as clever as it is difficult to avenge a woman without defending her.”"
"“王妃是正统派中的一位女英雄，所有有荣誉感的男人都有责任来保护她。”德阿泰兹冷冷地回答道，“她为她的主人们的事业所做的贡献将会使她所有愚蠢的行为得到宽恕。”","“The princess is one of those heroines of the legitimist party, and it is the duty of all men of honor to protect her quand meme,” replied d’Arthez, coldly.“What she has done for the cause of her masters would excuse all follies.”"
"“他是如此的谨慎啊！”纳坦对布隆代说道。","“He keeps his own counsel!” said Nathan to Blondet."
"“就像王妃真的是值得别人为她辩护似的。”拉斯蒂涅插嘴说，加入了两个人的谈话。","“Precisely as if the princess were worth it,” said Rastignac, joining the other two."
"德阿泰兹到王妃家里去。此刻，王妃正焦急万分地等着他的到来。这次由迪亚娜自己促成的试验要是失败了，对她而言简直是致命的。这个女人内心感到了痛苦，在她这一生中还是头一次。如果德阿泰兹相信世人的真话，而不听信她自己的假话了，她真不知道该怎么办才好。因为像德阿泰兹这样具有高贵天性、完美人品、纯洁灵魂以及质朴心地的男人从不曾落到过她的手中。尽管她已经告诉了德阿泰兹，她之所以捏造了这么一套残忍的谎言是受那种寻找真爱的欲望所驱使的，她还是担心。那种爱——她感觉到它在心中萌芽，是的，她爱上了德阿泰兹，而现在她要因为欺骗他而被永远地谴责了。从今往后，在他面前，她必须保持那个为蒙蔽他双眼而表演喜剧的女演员形象。","D’Arthez went to the princess, who was awaiting him with the keenest anxiety.The result of this experiment, which Diane had herself brought about, might be fatal to her.For the first time in her life this woman suffered in her heart.She knew not what she should do in case d’Arthez believed the world which spoke the truth, instead of believing her who lied; for never had so noble a nature, so complete a man, a soul so pure, a conscience so ingenuous come beneath her hand.Though she had told him cruel lies she was driven to do so by the desire of knowing a true love.That love—she felt it dawning in her heart; yes, she loved d’Arthez; and now she was condemned forever to deceive him!She must henceforth remain to him the actress who had played that comedy to blind his eyes."
"当她听到达尼埃尔走进餐厅的脚步声时，内心感到一种强烈的震动，一种震撼其生命的战栗。那种颤动的感觉在她曾经所有的惊险生活当中都从未出现过，她心里很明白，她已经把自己的幸福作为赌注压在了这件事上。她那凝视着空间的目光突然落在了德阿泰兹整个人身上，那目光好像穿过他的肉体看穿了他的灵魂，那儿连一点猜疑的影子都没有！此刻，内心积聚的恐惧转化为喜悦爆发了，几乎使她窒息。因为对人类来说，忍受痛苦的能力要比享受极致幸福的能力强得多。","When she heard Daniel’s step in the dining-room a violent commotion, a shudder which reached to her very vitals came over her.That convulsion, never felt during all the years of her adventurous existence, told her that she had staked her happiness on this issue.Her eyes, gazing into space, took in the whole of d’Arthez’s person; their light poured through his flesh, she read his soul; suspicion had not so much as touched him with its bat’s-wing.The terrible emotion of that fear then came to its reaction; joy almost stifled her; for there is no human being who is not more able to endure grief than to bear extreme felicity."
"“达尼埃尔，他们诽谤了我，而你却替我报了仇！”她站了起来喊道，一面张开双臂来拥抱他。","“Daniel, they have calumniated me, and you have avenged me!” she cried, rising, and opening her arms to him."
"听到这些话，他感到极为惊奇，他根本不知道王妃说这些话的原因。达尼埃尔自然地让王妃那双美丽的手抓住他的手，然后王妃便在其前额神圣地吻了一下。","In the profound amazement caused by these words, the roots of which were utterly unknown to him, Daniel allowed his hand to be taken between her beautiful hands, as the princess kissed him sacredly on the forehead."
"“可是，”他说道，“你是怎么知道的啊——”","“But,” he said, “how could you know—”"
"“噢！多么杰出的小傻瓜啊！难道你看不出来我已经疯狂地爱上你了吗？”","“Oh! illustrious ninny!do you not see that I love you fondly?”"
"从那天起，没有人再谈论德卡迪央王妃，也没有人再提起过德阿泰兹了。王妃从母亲那里继承了一笔财产，她每年夏天都在日内瓦湖边的一栋别墅里度过，而那位伟大的作家会在那里和她相聚。她冬天会回巴黎住几个月。人们只能在议院中见到德阿泰兹。他的著作变得极其稀少。故事到此是否就算是结束了呢？对于理性之人来说，是的；而对于那些喜欢刨根究底的人来说，不是。","Since that day nothing has been said of the Princess de Cadignan, nor of d’Arthez.The princess has inherited some fortune from her mother and she spends all her summers in a villa on the lake of Geneva, where the great writer joins her.She returns to Paris for a few months in winter.D’Arthez is never seen except in the Chamber.His writings are becoming exceedingly rare.Is this a conclusion?Yes, for people of sense; no, for persons who want to know everything."
