"斯芬克司","The Sphinx"
"作者：埃德加·爱伦·坡","by Edgar Allan Poe             "
"就在纽约霍乱疫情最严重的时候，我受一位亲戚之邀，来到他在哈得孙河岸旁边的度假别墅与他一起隐居了两周。我们附近的常见夏季娱乐一应俱全——林间漫步、写生、泛舟、垂钓、冲凉、音乐和书籍等等。我们本应该过得十分愉快，但每天早晨从人口密集的纽约传来的可怕消息让却人心情忐忑。每一天都会传来熟人去世的噩耗。渐渐地，随着死亡人数的增加，我们已经有了每天都会永远失去某位朋友的心理准备。到后来，一听到有送信人来的声音，我们就心惊胆战。对我们而言，从南边来的空气也似乎充满了死亡的气息。实际上，这样绝望的情绪已经将我牢牢掌控。我无法讲话，无法思考，更不用说幻想其他什么了。邀我同住的主人秉性平和，尽管他自己十分沮丧，但还是尽其所能给我以勇气。他豁然而处乱不惊的理智丝毫不会受到虚妄的想象的影响。对于引起恐慌的实质内容，他给予足够的重视，但他从不捕风捉影、杞人忧天。","During the dread reign of the Cholera in New York, I had accepted the invitation of a relative to spend a fortnight with him in the retirement of his cottage ornee on the banks of the Hudson.We had here around us all the ordinary means of summer amusement; and what with rambling in the woods, sketching, boating, fishing, bathing, music, and books, we should have passed the time pleasantly enough, but for the fearful intelligence which reached us every morning from the populous city.Not a day elapsed which did not bring us news of the decease of some acquaintance.Then as the fatality increased, we learned to expect daily the loss of some friend.At length we trembled at the approach of every messenger.The very air from the South seemed to us redolent with death.That palsying thought, indeed, took entire posession of my soul.I could neither speak, think, nor dream of any thing else.My host was of a less excitable temperament, and, although greatly depressed in spirits, exerted himself to sustain my own.His richly philosophical intellect was not at any time affected by unrealities.To the substances of terror he was sufficiently alive, but of its shadows he had no apprehension."
"他竭尽全力地想让我从异常忧郁的心态中振作起来，但所有努力皆因我在他藏书室中找到的某些书籍功亏一篑了。这些书籍唤醒了潜藏在我心里遗传性的迷信思想，并使之破土萌发。我读这些书他一直是不知情的，所以他常常感到困惑，兀自猜测我是怎么产生这些强烈的念头的。","His endeavors to arouse me from the condition of abnormal gloom into which I had fallen, were frustrated, in great measure, by certain volumes which I had found in his library.These were of a character to force into germination whatever seeds of hereditary superstition lay latent in my bosom.I had been reading these books without his knowledge, and thus he was often at a loss to account for the forcible impressions which had been made upon my fancy."
"我最喜欢谈论的话题就是大众对于预兆的迷信——在我人生中这样一个特殊时期，我几乎百分之百地愿意为它辩护。就这个话题我们曾展开过长时间的激烈讨论。他坚信对这些事情的迷信是毫无根据的，而我则坚持这种完全自发产生的普遍观点——即没有明显的受到某种暗示的迹象——本身一定具有无误的真理的成分，理应受到与天才具有的直觉一样的关注。","A favorite topic with me was the popular belief in omens—a belief which, at this one epoch of my life, I was almost seriously disposed to defend.On this subject we had long and animated discussions—he maintaining the utter groundlessness of faith in such matters,—I contending that a popular sentiment arising with absolute spontaneity—that is to say, without apparent traces of suggestion—had in itself the unmistakable elements of truth, and was entitled to as much respect as that intuition which is the idiosyncrasy of the individual man of genius."
"事实上，我到达别墅后不久就遇到了一件匪夷所思的事情，这件事本身带有如此强烈的不详的特性，即便我把这当成一种预兆也情有可原。这件事让我不寒而栗的同时又困惑不已，所以过了很多天后，我才下定决心告诉我的朋友。","The fact is, that soon after my arrival at the cottage there had occurred to myself an incident so entirely inexplicable, and which had in it so much of the portentous character, that I might well have been excused for regarding it as an omen.It appalled, and at the same time so confounded and bewildered me, that many days elapsed before I could make up my mind to communicate the circumstances to my friend."
"一天傍晚，天气异常闷热，我手里拿着书坐在窗边，从开着的窗户向下望去。通过河岸边一片长条形的远景，远处的山脉清晰可见。离我位置最近的这一面山被所谓的泥石流侵袭，此时已全无树木，只是光秃秃的一片。我的思绪从眼前的书册飘到了邻近阴郁、凄惨的城市。我的目光从书页上抬起，落到了山上光秃的一面。突然，我看见一个物体——一个形容丑陋、无比狰狞的怪物。它飞快地从山顶蹿到山脚，最后消失在下面茂密的丛林里。当这个怪物第一次进入我视线的时候，我曾怀疑自己神志不清，或者至少是眼花看错了。直到好几分钟过后，我才最终确信，自己既没疯也没做梦。但当我描述这个怪物的时候（我清清楚楚地看见了它，并平静地俯瞰了它所有的举动），我担心我的读者比我更难相信这些事实。","Near the close of exceedingly warm day, I was sitting, book in hand, at an open window, commanding, through a long vista of the river banks, a view of a distant hill, the face of which nearest my position had been denuded by what is termed a land-slide, of the principal portion of its trees.My thoughts had been long wandering from the volume before me to the gloom and desolation of the neighboring city.Uplifting my eyes from the page, they fell upon the naked face of the bill, and upon an object—upon some living monster of hideous conformation, which very rapidly made its way from the summit to the bottom, disappearing finally in the dense forest below.As this creature first came in sight, I doubted my own sanity—or at least the evidence of my own eyes; and many minutes passed before I succeeded in convincing myself that I was neither mad nor in a dream.Yet when I described the monster (which I distinctly saw, and calmly surveyed through the whole period of its progress), my readers, I fear, will feel more difficulty in being convinced of these points than even I did myself."
"我以它往山下蹿时经过的那些大树（在泥石流的恣虐中幸存的很少的几棵大树）的直径作为参照来估摸那个怪物的大小，结论是它比现存的任何第一线作战军舰都要大得多。之所以说到战舰，是因为这个怪物的外形使我联想到——我们那种装有74门大炮的军舰尚可体现出它的整体轮廓。此怪物长有一个长鼻，大约60或70英尺长，粗若普通的象身。它的口部就在鼻子的末端。在接近其长鼻根部的地方，长满了一大片浓密的黑毛，比20个水牛身上的毛加起来还要多；从这团黑毛里又朝两侧伸出两条发光的长獠牙，状若野猪之尖牙，但前者的体积大到无法与后者相提并论。而在其长鼻两边，各平行地伸出一根巨大的棒状物，长约30或40英尺，状如棱镜，质若纯水晶——绚丽夺目地反射着落日的余晖。而其长鼻则酷似一个顶端向下的楔。从长鼻里伸出两对翅膀——每个翅膀的长度将近100码——一对叠在另一对的上方，且都被金属鳞片重重地覆盖着，每个鳞片的直径看上去大约10或12英尺。我注意到，上下两层翅膀有一根结实的链条将它们相连。然而，这个可怖怪物的最古怪的一点是——它身上有一个骷髅头的图案，几乎覆盖着整个胸部，在身体黑色的底色上用耀眼的白色精确地勾勒出轮廓，就像是哪个艺术家的精心之作。当我注视着这个庞大的动物，尤其是其胸部的图案时，我不禁毛骨悚然，有种大难临头的感觉，而且我发现用理智根本无法平息这种情绪。突然，这个怪物长鼻末端的巨颌猛然张开，发出一声震耳欲聋、凄惨至极的巨响，像丧钟般敲打在我脆弱的神经上。当怪物消失在山下时，我立刻昏厥在地上，人事不省。","Estimating the size of the creature by comparison with the diameter of the large trees near which it passed—the few giants of the forest which had escaped the fury of the land-slide—I concluded it to be far larger than any ship of the line in existence.I say ship of the line, because the shape of the monster suggested the idea—the hull of one of our seventy-four might convey a very tolerable conception of the general outline.The mouth of the animal was situated at the extremity of a proboscis some sixty or seventy feet in length, and about as thick as the body of an ordinary elephant.Near the root of this trunk was an immense quantity of black shaggy hair—more than could have been supplied by the coats of a score of buffaloes; and projecting from this hair downwardly and laterally, sprang two gleaming tusks not unlike those of the wild boar, but of infinitely greater dimensions.Extending forward, parallel with the proboscis, and on each side of it, was a gigantic staff, thirty or forty feet in length, formed seemingly of pure crystal and in shape a perfect prism,—it reflected in the most gorgeous manner the rays of the declining sun.The trunk was fashioned like a wedge with the apex to the earth.From it there were outspread two pairs of wings—each wing nearly one hundred yards in length—one pair being placed above the other, and all thickly covered with metal scales; each scale apparently some ten or twelve feet in diameter.I observed that the upper and lower tiers of wings were connected by a strong chain.But the chief peculiarity of this horrible thing was the representation of a Death’s Head, which covered nearly the whole surface of its breast, and which was as accurately traced in glaring white, upon the dark ground of the body, as if it had been there carefully designed by an artist.While I regarded the terrific animal, and more especially the appearance on its breast, with a feeling or horror and awe—with a sentiment of forthcoming evil, which I found it impossible to quell by any effort of the reason, I perceived the huge jaws at the extremity of the proboscis suddenly expand themselves, and from them there proceeded a sound so loud and so expressive of wo, that it struck upon my nerves like a knell and as the monster disappeared at the foot of the hill, I fell at once, fainting, to the floor."
"苏醒以后，我第一个冲动当然就是想告诉我朋友我看到的和听到的一切——我不知道是怎样的一种厌恶的感觉，最终阻止了我。","Upon recovering, my first impulse, of course, was to inform my friend of what I had seen and heard—and I can scarcely explain what feeling of repugnance it was which, in the end, operated to prevent me."
"后来的一天晚上，大约距这件事情发生三或四天后，我们一起坐在那间我看到特异景象的屋子里——我坐在相同的窗边的相同的座位上，而朋友斜靠在旁边的沙发上。地点和时间的巧合让我又联想到了那天的情景，我不得不向他描述一番。他听着我从头到尾讲完——起先狂笑了一阵——然后神情变得无比凝重，好像我的神经错乱已是不争的事实。就在这时，我又清楚地看到那个怪物，我不禁恐惧地尖叫起来，这引起了他的注意。他急切地朝外看，尽管我紧随着那怪物从光秃的山坡上蹿下时的轨迹准确地指着它，但他坚持说什么也没看见。","At length, one evening, some three or four days after the occurrence, we were sitting together in the room in which I had seen the apparition—I occupying the same seat at the same window, and he lounging on a sofa near at hand.The association of the place and time impelled me to give him an account of the phenomenon.He heard me to the end—at first laughed heartily—and then lapsed into an excessively grave demeanor, as if my insanity was a thing beyond suspicion.At this instant I again had a distinct view of the monster—to which, with a shout of absolute terror, I now directed his attention.He looked eagerly—but maintained that he saw nothing—although I designated minutely the course of the creature, as it made its way down the naked face of the hill."
"此时我已是惊慌失措，因为我把这种景象当成是我死亡的预兆，或者更糟——狂躁症的前兆。我激动地重重跌回到椅子上，头埋在双手里好一会儿。等我挪开双手时，那种特异景象又看不到了。","I was now immeasurably alarmed, for I considered the vision either as an omen of my death, or, worse, as the fore-runner of an attack of mania.I threw myself passionately back in my chair, and for some moments buried my face in my hands.When I uncovered my eyes, the apparition was no longer apparent."
"这时我的东道主已经在一定程度上恢复了他的冷静，并认真地询问我那个虚幻怪物的外形。当我仔仔细细地把那骷髅头向他描述以后，他深深地叹了一口气，仿佛卸下了无法承受的包袱一般。然后带着在我看来近乎冷峻的平静口吻谈论起思辨哲学，在此之前这一直是我们讨论的话题。我记得他曾经十分坚持（除其他事情外）一个观点——人类在一切调查研究中所犯的错误都源于推断的倾向性，即对事物的远近做出错误的判断，从而过高或过低地估计该事物的重要性。“比如，”他说，“要想准确地评估深入的民主普及对于人类这样的一个整体的影响就应该要考虑到一项内容——即这样的民主普及有可能是在哪个年代达成的，距今有多长时间。然而，你能告诉我有哪个做政府项目的执笔者认为这项特殊议题值得探讨呢？”","My host, however, had in some degree resumed the calmness of his demeanor, and questioned me very rigorously in respect to the conformation of the visionary creature.When I had fully satisfied him on this head, he sighed deeply, as if relieved of some intolerable burden, and went on to talk, with what I thought a cruel calmness, of various points of speculative philosophy, which had heretofore formed subject of discussion between us.I remember his insisting very especially (among other things) upon the idea that the principle source of error in all human investigations lay in the liability of the understanding to under-rate or to over-value the importance of an object, through mere mis-admeasurement of its propinquity.“To estimate properly, for example,” he said, “the influence to be exercised on mankind at large by the thorough diffusion of Democracy, the distance of the epoch at which such diffusion may possibly be accomplished should not fail to form an item in the estimate.Yet can you tell me one writer on the subject of government who has ever thought this particular branch of the subject worthy of discussion at all?”"
"说到这儿他停下了，走到一个书架旁，抽出一本关于博物学的概要书。为了看清楚书上密密麻麻的印刷字，他要我和他调换位置。他坐在窗边的椅子上，翻开书，用和刚才几乎一样的语气继续他的论述。","He here paused for a moment, stepped to a book-case, and brought forth one of the ordinary synopses of Natural History.Requesting me then to exchange seats with him, that he might the better distinguish the fine print of the volume, he took my armchair at the window, and, opening the book, resumed his discourse very much in the same tone as before."
"他说：“要不是你对那个怪物细致入微的描绘，我也许永远也说明不了它到底是什么。先让我给你读读一个男学生对一种蛾属（英文的Sphinx既有“斯芬克司”之意，又有“天蛾”之意，此处和标题为双关语）小动物的描述，这种动物属于昆虫纲、鳞翅目及黄昏科。他是这么说的：","“But for your exceeding minuteness,” he said, “in describing the monster, I might never have had it in my power to demonstrate to you what it was.In the first place, let me read to you a schoolboy account of the genus Sphinx, of the family Crepuscularia of the order Lepidoptera, of the class of Insecta—or insects.The account runs thus:"
"“‘四个薄膜状的翼上面布满了金属样的鳞片；嘴部构成一个卷状的长鼻，由延伸出的颌部形成，侧面可见下颚和绒毛状触须的退化器官；下面的翼由一根硬毛固定在上面的翼上；触角呈延伸的棱柱形；腹部为尖状。骷髅天蛾除了哀怨的叫声外，还在其甲胄外佩戴一枚死神徽章，这些都让人们对它感到非常恐惧。’”","“‘Four membranous wings covered with little colored scales of metallic appearance; mouth forming a rolled proboscis, produced by an elongation of the jaws, upon the sides of which are found the rudiments of mandibles and downy palpi; the inferior wings retained to the superior by a stiff hair; antennae in the form of an elongated club, prismatic; abdomen pointed, The Death’s-headed Sphinx has occasioned much terror among the vulgar, at times, by the melancholy kind of cry which it utters, and the insignia of death which it wears upon its corslet.’”"
"接着，他合上书，在椅子上把身子向前倾，正好让自己处在我看到“怪物”时的那个位置。","He here closed the book and leaned forward in the chair, placing himself accurately in the position which I had occupied at the moment of beholding “the monster.”"
"“哦，就是它，”没过一会儿，他喊了起来，“它现在又在山坡上向上爬呢，我承认它的模样看上去确实十分特别。当然，它远远没有你想象得那么大那么远。事实上，当它从蜘蛛在窗框边结就的这根网线上挣扎向上爬时，我发现它至多只有一英寸的十六分之一左右那么长，而距离我的眼球也同样只有一英寸的十六分之一左右。”","“Ah, here it is,” he presently exclaimed—“it is reascending the face of the hill, and a very remarkable looking creature I admit it to be.Still, it is by no means so large or so distant as you imagined it,—for the fact is that, as it wriggles its way up this thread, which some spider has wrought along the window-sash, I find it to be about the sixteenth of an inch in its extreme length, and also about the sixteenth of an inch distant from the pupil of my eye.”"
