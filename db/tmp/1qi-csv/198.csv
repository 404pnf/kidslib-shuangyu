"北方的奥德赛","An Odyssey of the North"
"作者：杰克·伦敦","by Jack London"
"雪橇和着挽具嘎吱嘎吱的声响和带头狗的脖子上发出的叮呤当啷的铃声，正在吟唱着永恒的哀歌；但是人和狗都累了，都不出声。路上铺着厚厚的、刚刚落下的雪。他们来自远方，雪橇上载着很多四开的冻得跟燧石一样僵硬的鹿。橇板紧贴着还没轧结实的道路，总是往后退，像人一样倔强。夜幕正在降临，但是这一晚他们没有帐篷可搭。雪从毫无生气的空中轻轻飘落，不是雪花，而是小巧精致的雪晶。天很暖和——只有零下十度——大家都不在乎。迈耶斯和贝斯特已经把护耳翻了起来，马尔穆特·基德连手套都摘下来了。","The sleds were singing their eternal lament to the creaking of the harnesses and the tinkling bells of the leaders; but the men and dogs were tired and made no sound.The trail was heavy with new-fallen snow, and they had come far, and the runners, burdened with flint-like quarters of frozen moose, clung tenaciously to the unpacked surface and held back with a stubbornness almost human.Darkness was coming on, but there was no camp to pitch that night.The snow fell gently through the pulseless air, not in flakes, but in tiny frost crystals of delicate design.It was very warm,—barely ten below zero,—and the men did not mind.Meyers and Bettles had raised their ear-flaps, while Malemute Kid had even taken off his mittens."
"这群狗在下午的早些时候就已经累坏了，但是现在，它们开始展现出新的活力。那些感觉比较敏锐的已经有点儿坐立不安了——似乎无法承受拖索的束缚，想快点儿跑又犹豫不决，它们竖着耳朵，用鼻子吸着气。慢慢地，它们开始对那些感觉不灵敏的伙伴发火了，不断狡猾地咬着它们的后腿，催着它们前进。那些遭到责怪的狗也感染了这样的毛病，又将这样的毛病传给别的狗。最后，最前面那架雪橇的带头狗心满意足地高声吠了一声，匍匐在雪中，使出浑身力气绷紧了颈圈，往前冲去。别的狗都跟着它做。后面的皮带一缩，拖索一紧，一架架雪橇就冲向前方了。人们不得不抓紧橇把，猛地抬高双脚，以免被橇板压住。一天的劳累都消失了，他们大声喊叫着，催促狗快点儿前进。那群狗也用高兴的叫声回应着他们。它们在渐渐变黑的夜色中，放开脚步，啪嗒啪嗒地快速奔跑起来。","The dogs had been fagged out early in the afternoon, but they now began to show new vigor.Among the more astute there was a certain restlessness,—an impatience at the restraint of the traces, an indecisive quickness of movement, a sniffing of snouts and pricking of ears.These became incensed at their more phlegmatic brothers, urging them on with numerous sly nips on their hinder-quarters.Those, thus chidden, also contracted and helped spread the contagion.At last, the leader of the foremost sled uttered a sharp whine of satisfaction, crouching lower in the snow and throwing himself against the collar.The rest followed suit.There was an ingathering of back-bands, a tightening of traces; the sleds leaped forward, and the men clung to the gee-poles, violently accelerating the uplift of their feet that they might escape going under the runners.The weariness of the day fell from them, and they whooped encouragement to the dogs.The animals responded with joyous yelps.They were swinging through the gathering darkness at a rattling gallop."
"“往右拐！往右拐！”他们顺次喊道，一架架雪橇忽然偏离了主道，掀起一侧的橇板，像顺风行驶的小帆船一样向前奔去。","“Gee!Gee!” the men cried, each in turn, as their sleds abruptly left the main-trail, heeling over on single runners like luggers on the wind."
"雪橇一下子冲了一百码，来到一个透着光亮的羊皮纸窗户前。一瞧就知道这座木屋是他们的家，里面有烧得呼啦响的育空式火炉和冒着热气的茶壶。但是这木屋已经被占领了。六十只爱斯基摩狗威风凛凛地一起咆哮着，这群浑身是毛的家伙猛地朝拉着第一架雪橇的狗扑了过去。门猛地开了，一个身穿西北警察的红色束腰制服的人，踏着及膝深的雪，沉着而公正地拿狗鞭的柄把那群疯狂的家伙收拾得老老实实。之后，双方握手，就这样，马尔穆特·基德被一个外人迎进了本属于他的木屋。","Then came a hundred yards’ dash to the lighted parchment window, which told its own story of the home cabin, the roaring Yukon stove, and the steaming pots of tea.But the home cabin had been invaded.Three-score huskies chorused defiance, and as many furry forms precipitated themselves upon the dogs which drew the first sled.The door was flung open, and a man, clad in the scarlet tunic of the Northwest Police, waded knee-deep among the furious brutes, calmly and impartially dispensing soothing justice with the butt end of a dog-whip.After that, the men shook hands; and in this wise was Malemute Kid welcomed to his own cabin by a stranger."
"应该是斯坦利·普林斯去迎接他的，前面提过的育空式火炉和冒着热气的茶壶正是由他负责照看的。不过他正忙着接待客人。这些客人差不多有十来个，尽管都是为英国女王执行法规和传送信件的人，但我们却很难把他们归为某一类。他们有着不同的血统，但是同样的生活使他们成了同一种类型的人——身材瘦长却结实。他们有着硬实的肌肉、被太阳晒得黝黑的脸和平静的灵魂，因此他们总是目光明亮且坚定地注视着前方。他们驾着女王的狗，让她的对手闻风丧胆；他们吃的是她分发的很少的口粮，但是很快乐。他们见多识广，做过很多大事，他们的生活像一部传奇，但是他们自己却对此一无所知。","Stanley Prince, who should have welcomed him, and who was responsible for the Yukon stove and hot tea aforementioned, was busy with his guests.There were a dozen or so of them, as nondescript a crowd as ever served the Queen in the enforcement of her laws or the delivery of her mails.They were of many breeds, but their common life had formed of them a certain type,—a lean and wiry type, with trail-hardened muscles, and sun-browned faces, and untroubled souls which gazed frankly forth, clear-eyed and steady.They drove the dogs of the Queen, wrought fear in the hearts of her enemies, ate of her meagre fare, and were happy.They had seen life, and done deeds, and lived romances; but they did not know it."
"而且他们过得非常舒适。其中有两个人伸开手脚大躺在马尔穆特·基德的床上，嘴里唱着歌，当初他们的法国人祖先到西北地区和印第安女人结婚时唱的就是这样的歌。贝特尔斯的床铺也被霸占了，三四个健壮的押运员裹着毯子，一边揉脚，一边听一个人讲故事。这个人在沃尔斯利进攻喀土穆的时候，在他的舰队中服过役。等他讲累了，一个牛仔就说起了当年他和布法洛·比尔游览欧洲各国首都时，所见过的宫廷、国王和王公贵妇。屋子的一个角落里有两个混血儿，他们是一起吃过败仗的老伙计，正在一边修理雪橇上的挽具，一边说着当时西北地区人们不断地起义，路易·里尔称王时的情形。","And they were very much at home.Two of them were sprawled upon Malemute Kid’s bunk, singing chansons which their French forbears sang in the days when first they entered the Northwest-land and mated with its Indian women.Bettles’ bunk had suffered a similar invasion, and three or four lusty voyageurs worked their toes among its blankets as they listened to the tale of one who had served on the boat brigade with Wolseley when he fought his way to Khartoum.And when he tired, a cowboy told of courts and kings and lords and ladies he had seen when Buffalo Bill toured the capitals of Europe.In a corner, two half-breeds, ancient comrades in a lost campaign, mended harnesses and talked of the days when the Northwest flamed with insurrection and Louis Reil was king."
"粗鲁的笑话和更粗鲁的玩笑话此起彼伏，水路和陆路上相当危险的事从他们嘴里说出来，都变得很平常，似乎他们之所以会想到这些事情，只是因为其中一些滑稽可笑的情节。这些无冕英雄的话语深深吸引了普林斯，他们亲眼目睹了历史是怎样创造的，然而他们却把那些伟大的、带着传奇色彩的事情看作平日里一些普通的、偶然的小事情。他把自己宝贵的烟草毫不吝惜地分给大家；为了回报他的慷慨，已经生锈的记忆的链条展开了，淡忘已久的奥德赛式的故事也重新被想起来了。","Rough jests and rougher jokes went up and down, and great hazards by trail and river were spoken of in the light of commonplaces, only to be recalled by virtue of some grain of humor or ludicrous happening.Prince was led away by these uncrowned heroes who had seen history made, who regarded the great and the romantic as but the ordinary and the incidental in the routine of life.He passed his precious tobacco among them with lavish disregard, and rusty chains of reminiscence were loosened, and forgotten odysseys resurrected for his especial benefit."
"交谈停止以后，客人们装上最后一袋烟草，解开他们裹得紧紧的皮毯子时，普林斯扭过头，准备跟他的老伙计进一步了解这些人的情况。","When conversation dropped and the travelers filled the last pipes and unlashed their tight-rolled sleeping-furs, Prince fell back upon his comrade for further information."
"“那好吧，那个牛仔的身份你是知道的，”马尔穆特·基德一边回答，一边着手解开他那双软帮皮鞋的鞋带，“那个跟他睡在一起、有英国血统的人，他的身份也很容易猜得到。至于其他的人，他们都是森林里的流浪汉，他们的血统太复杂，只有天知道。睡在门口的那两个人，是地道的‘法裔’，也就是‘木炭’。那个围着毛线围巾的小伙子——注意一下他的眉毛和下巴——你就会知道，曾经有个苏格兰男人在他母亲那个烟雾弥漫的帐篷里抹过眼泪。还有那个把斗篷枕在头底下的英俊年轻人，他有一半的法国血统——你听见过他说的话；他讨厌那两个睡在他旁边的印第安人。你知道吗，当年那些‘法裔’在里尔的带领下起义的时候，地道的印第安人却没有支持他们，从那以后，他们相互之间就没有什么好感了。”","“Well, you know what the cowboy is,” Malemute Kid answered, beginning to unlace his moccasins; “and it’s not hard to guess the British blood in his bed-partner.As for the rest, they’re all children of the coureurs du bois, mingled with God knows how many other bloods.The two turning in by the door are the regulation ‘breeds’ or bois brules.That lad with the worsted breech scarf—notice his eyebrows and the turn of his jaw—shows a Scotchman wept in his mother’s smoky tepee.And that handsome-looking fellow putting the capote under his head is a French half-breed,—you heard him talking; he doesn’t like the two Indians turning in next to him.You see, when the ‘breeds’ rose under Reil the full-bloods kept the peace, and they’ve not lost much love for one another since.”"
"“但是，火炉边上那个阴沉着脸的家伙又是一个怎样的人呢？我打赌他肯定不会说英语。他一晚上都没开口说过话。”","“But I say, what’s that glum-looking fellow by the stove?  I’ll swear he can’t talk English.He hasn’t opened his mouth all night.”"
"“你错了。他的英语很棒。你留意到他听人讲话时的目光了吗？我留意到了。但是他跟其他人并不沾亲带故。当他们说自己家乡话的时候，你就能看出他根本听不懂。我也在想他究竟是什么人。咱们来打探一下。”","“You’re wrong.He knows English well enough.Did you follow his eyes when he listened?I did.But he’s neither kith nor kin to the others.When they talked their own patois you could see he didn’t understand.I ’ve been wondering myself what he is.Let’s find out.”"
"“往火炉里添些柴！”马尔穆特·基德瞧着那个身份不明的人，提高了嗓门吩咐他。","“Fire a couple of sticks into the stove!”Malemute Kid commanded, raising his voice and looking squarely at the man in question."
"他立刻照做了。","He obeyed at once."
"“他一定是在什么地方受过训练。”普林斯低声评论道。马尔穆特·基德点了点头，然后脱下袜子，从躺着的人群里小心翼翼地走到火炉旁边。他把湿了的鞋袜和二十来双鞋袜挂在一起。","“Had discipline knocked into him somewhere,” Prince commented in a low tone.Malemute Kid nodded, took off his socks, and picked his way among the recumbent men to the stove.There he hung his damp footgear among a score or so of mates."
"“你觉得什么时候可以到达道森呢？”他试探着问道。","“When do you expect to get to Dawson?” he asked tentatively."
"那个人细细将他端详一番之后才回答：“听说还有七十五英里。对吗？估计得两天吧。”","The man studied him a moment before replying.“They say seventy-five mile.So?Maybe two days.”"
"可以听得出他的口音有点儿特别，但是没有停顿，也没有琢磨用词。","The very slightest accent was perceptible, while there was no awkward hesitancy or groping for words."
"“过去来过这里？”","“Been in the country before?”"
"“没来过。”","“No.”"
"“西北地区呢？”","“Northwest Territory?”"
"“去过。”","“Yes.”"
"“在那里出生的吧？”","“Born there?”"
"“不是。”","“No.”"
"“那么，你到底从哪里来的呢？你和他们不是一个地方的人。”马尔穆特·基德把手朝那些赶狗的人一挥，就连在普林斯床上睡觉的那两名警察也包括在内。“你是从什么地方来的呢？我以前见过你这样的脸孔，尽管我不记得是在什么地方见过的了。”","“Well, where the devil were you born?You ’re none of these.”Malemute Kid swept his hand over the dog-drivers, even including the two policemen who had turned into Prince’s bunk.“Where did you come from?I’ve seen faces like yours before, though I can’t remember just where.”"
"“我认得你。”他说了句不相干的话，立刻把马尔穆特·基德引到了另一个话题上。","“I know you,” he irrelevantly replied, at once turning the drift of Malemute Kid’s questions."
"“在什么地方？你见过我？”","“Where?Ever see me?”"
"“不是你，是你的伙计，他是个牧师，在帕斯提里克，很久以前。他问我有没有见过你，马尔穆特·基德。他给了我一些吃的。我在那里没有呆很长时间。你有没有听他说起过我？”","“No; your partner, him priest, Pastilik, long time ago.Him ask me if I see you, Malemute Kid.Him give me grub.I no stop long.You hear him speak ‘bout me?”"
"“哦！你就是那个拿海獭皮换狗的人吗？”","“Oh! you ’re the fellow that traded the otter skins for the dogs?”"
"那个人点点头，敲出烟斗里的灰，然后裹紧毛皮衣，表示他不想继续往下谈了。马尔穆特·基德把那盏油灯吹灭，和普林斯一起钻进毯子里去了。","The man nodded, knocked out his pipe, and signified his disinclination for conversation by rolling up in his furs.Malemute Kid blew out the slush-lamp and crawled under the blankets with Prince."
"“那么，他是什么人呢？”","“Well, what is he?”"
"“不知道——不知道怎么回事，他把我引到别的话题上了，然后就像蛤蜊一样闭上了嘴。但这是个会激起人好奇心的家伙。我听说过他。八年前，沿海地区的人就对他很好奇。有点儿神秘，你知道。在严冬里，他从离这里有上千英里的北部，一路沿着白令海峡赶到这里，就像有魔鬼追着他似的。没有人知道他是从什么地方来的，但是可以肯定的是，他一定来自遥远的地方。他到戈洛文湾的时候已经精疲力尽了，他从瑞典牧师那里弄了些吃的，还打探了到南方来的路。这些事，我们都是事后听说的。后来，他放弃了海岸线，径直从诺顿湾渡过来。天气极其恶劣，经常是狂风暴雪，但是他挺过来了，要是换成别人，就算有一千个人，也早没命了。因为错过了在圣·迈克尔登陆，他就在帕斯提里克上岸了。他什么都没了，只剩两条狗，自己险些就给饿死了。","“Don’t know—turned me off, somehow, and then shut up like a clam.But he ’s a fellow to whet your curiosity.I’ve heard of him.All the Coast wondered about him eight years ago.Sort of mysterious, you know.He came down out of the North, in the dead of winter, many a thousand miles from here, skirting Bering Sea and traveling as though the devil were after him.No one ever learned where he came from, but he must have come far.He was badly travel-worn when he got food from the Swedish missionary on Golovin Bay and asked the way south.We heard of this afterward.Then he abandoned the shore-line, heading right across Norton Sound.Terrible weather, snowstorms and high winds, but he pulled through where a thousand other men would have died, missing St.Michael’s and making the land at Pastilik.He’d lost all but two dogs, and was nearly gone with starvation."
"“鲁博神父见他急着赶路，就给了他一些吃的；但是不能送给他狗，因为等我到了以后，神父自己也要出门。尤利西斯先生清楚地知道，没有狗是没法上路的，因此他烦躁了好几天。他雪橇上有一捆硝得不错的海獭皮，你知道，它们可是跟金子一样贵重呢。那个时候，帕斯提里克有一个俄国生意人，老夏洛克，他有几条狗准备要宰了。这笔生意很快就做成了，等这个古怪的人再往南去的时候，他的雪橇前面已经有一群疾速奔跑的狗了。而夏洛克先生也得到了那捆海獭皮。我见过的，非常不错。我们算了一下，每条狗给他赚了至少五百块钱。不是说这个古怪的人不晓得海獭皮的价钱；某种程度上说，他是个印第安人，从他讲的那寥寥数语中，还能听出他曾和白人一起呆过。","“He was so anxious to go on that Father Roubeau fitted him out with grub; but he couldn’t let him have any dogs, for he was only waiting my arrival to go on a trip himself.Mr. Ulysses knew too much to start on without animals, and fretted around for several days.He had on his sled a bunch of beautifully cured otter skins, sea-otters, you know, worth their weight in gold.There was also at Pastilik an old Shylock of a Russian trader, who had dogs to kill.Well, they didn’t dicker very long, but when the Strange One headed south again, it was in the rear of a spanking dog-team.Mr. Shylock, by the way, had the otter skins.I saw them, and they were magnificent.We figured it up and found the dogs brought him at least five hundred apiece.And it wasn’t as if the Strange One didn’t know the value of sea-otter; he was an Indian of some sort, and what little he talked showed he’d been among white men."
"“海面上的冰消融以后，从努尼瓦克岛传来消息说，他去那里找过吃的。然后他就消失了，这是八年里第一次又听到他的消息。那么如今，他是从什么地方来的呢？他在那里做了些什么？他又是为什么离开那里的呢？他是一个印第安人，他去过别人都不知道的地方，还接受过训练，这对于一个印第安人而言，是不常见的。这又是一个需要你来解决的北方的奥秘，普林斯。”","“After the ice passed out of the Sea, word came up from Nunivak Island that he’d gone in there for grub.Then he dropped from sight, and this is the first heard of him in eight years.Now where did he come from? and what was he doing there? and why did he come from there?He’s Indian, he’s been nobody knows where, and he’s had discipline, which is unusual for an Indian.Another mystery of the North for you to solve, Prince.”"
"“太感谢你了，但是如今我手头上需要解决的事情太多了。”他回答道。","“Thanks, awfully; but I’ve got too many on hand as it is,” he replied."
"马尔穆特·基德已经睡着了；但是这位年轻的采矿工程师依旧睁着眼睛，在黑暗中注视着上方，等着那股莫名其妙的、令他血液翻腾的兴奋劲儿渐渐平静。等他睡着以后，他的大脑还在不停地活动，在那一段时间里，他仿佛也在那种谁都不知道的雪地里游荡，在没有尽头的路上和狗一起艰难跋涉着，还看见了人们在生活，辛苦工作，最后像男子汉一样死去。","Malemute Kid was already breathing heavily; but the young mining engineer gazed straight up through the thick darkness, waiting for the strange orgasm which stirred his blood to die away.And when he did sleep, his brain worked on, and for the nonce he, too, wandered through the white unknown, struggled with the dogs on endless trails, and saw men live, and toil, and die like men."
"第二天早上，天未破晓，邮差和警察们便前往道森。但是代表女王陛下的利益，代她左右百姓命运的机构，却不让这些邮差们歇息；过了一个星期，他们又出现在斯图尔特河边，载着沉甸甸的运往盐湖的信件。不过，他们的狗倒是换了一批新的；但是，它们是狗。","The next morning, hours before daylight, the dog-drivers and policemen pulled out for Dawson.But the powers that saw to her Majesty’s interests, and ruled the destinies of her lesser creatures, gave the mailmen little rest; for a week later they appeared at Stuart River, heavily burdened with letters for Salt Water.However, their dogs had been replaced by fresh ones; but then, they were dogs."
"这些人原本盼望能停留几天，好歇息一下；而且，克朗代克又是北部的一个新地区，他们早就盼着能见识见识这个金沙似水、舞厅里狂欢不止的黄金城市。但是，如今他们几乎跟上次来时一样，烘着袜子，吸着烟。不过，他们当中有一两个胆子大的已经有了逃跑的念头，正盘算着能不能穿过没被开发过的落基山脉去往东部，然后沿着麦肯齐山谷，走到他们喜欢且常去的老地方——契帕文一带。有两三个人甚至打定主意，在任职期满以后一起顺着那条路回家。他们立即开始制定计划，期待着这番冒险，就像一个在城市长大的人渴望到森林里度过一天假期一样。","The men had expected some sort of a lay-over in which to rest up; besides, this Klondike was a new section of the Northland, and they had wished to see a little something of the Golden City where dust flowed like water, and dance halls rang with never ending revelry.But they dried their socks and smoked their evening pipes with much the same gusto as on their former visit, though one or two bold spirits speculated on desertion and the possibility of crossing the unexplored Rockies to the east, and thence, by the Mackenzie Valley, of gaining their old stamping-grounds in the Chippewyan Country.Two or three even decided to return to their homes by that route when their terms of service had expired, and they began to lay plans forthwith, looking forward to the hazardous undertaking in much the same way a city-bred man would to a day’s holiday in the woods."
"那个用海獭皮换狗的人显得心神不宁，尽管他对这样的讨论没有半点儿兴趣，后来，他把马尔穆特·基德拉到一边，小声说了一会儿话。普林斯好奇地盯着他们，后来，他们竟然戴上帽子和手套出去了，这情形就更加神秘了。他们回来以后，马尔穆特·基德把他的称金子的秤搁到桌子上，称了六十盎司的金子，放进那个古怪的人的袋子里。然后，邮差们的头儿也加入了他们的秘密会谈，而且还跟他做了某种买卖。第二天，这群人沿河而上，而那个用海獭皮换狗的人却带着几磅吃的，返回道森去了。","He of the Otter Skins seemed very restless, though he took little interest in the discussion, and at last he drew Malemute Kid to one side and talked for some time in low tones.Prince cast curious eyes in their direction, and the mystery deepened when they put on caps and mittens, and went outside.When they returned, Malemute Kid placed his gold-scales on the table, weighed out the matter of sixty ounces, and transferred them to the Strange One’s sack.Then the chief of the dog-drivers joined the conclave, and certain business was transacted with him.The next day the gang went on up river, but He of the Otter Skins took several pounds of grub and turned his steps back toward Dawson."
"普林斯问他的时候，马尔穆特·基德说：“我也搞不清到底是怎么回事；反正这个可怜的人肯定是有什么原因才不想干了的——至少对他来说是一个很重要的原因，但是他不愿意让别人知道。你明白的，做这种活计就跟当兵一样；他签了两年，要想离开就得把自己赎岀来。他不能擅离职守后再留在这里，而且他发了疯似的想留在这里。他说，他刚到道森就拿定主意了；但是他跟谁都不认识，身上没一分钱，也就只跟我一个人说过两句话。所以，他就跟副总督谈了一下，而且说好，要是他能从我这里弄到钱就办理退职——就是跟我借钱，你知道的。他说一年之内就能还我，假如我愿意的话，他可以给我指条财路。他从没去过那里，但是他知道那里很富有。","“Didn’t know what to make of it,” said Malemute Kid in response to Prince’s queries; “but the poor beggar wanted to be quit of the service for some reason or other—at least it seemed a most important one to him, though he wouldn’t let on what.You see, it’s just like the army; he signed for two years, and the only way to get free was to buy himself out.He couldn’t desert and then stay here, and he was just wild to remain in the country.Made up his mind when he got to Dawson, he said; but no one knew him, hadn’t a cent, and I was the only one he’d spoken two words with.So he talked it over with the Lieutenant-Governor, and made arrangements in case he could get the money from me—loan, you know.Said he’d pay back in the year, and if I wanted, would put me onto something rich.Never’d seen it, but knew it was rich."
"“听我说！哎，他把我拉到外边的时候都快哭了。他苦苦哀求，还在雪地里给我跪下，直到我把他拽起来。他像疯子一样唠叨了好久。他还发誓说自己为了实现这个目标已经受了很多年的苦，这次愿望要是落空，他可承受不了。我问他有什么目的，他不肯说。他说，他们可能会把他分配到这条路的另外半段上工作，那样两年之内他就回不了道森了，那时候就太晚了。我这辈子，还没见过有人这么难过呢。等我同意把金子借给他的时候，我又只好把他从雪地里拽起来。我对他说，这些钱就当是我的股份好了。你以为他答应了吗？没有，老兄！他发誓说会把找到的东西全给我，让我富得连做梦都不敢想，反正他反反复复说的就是这些话。通常，一个长期给投资人拼命的人，如果得到了什么，往往连一半都舍不得分给那个投资人的。普林斯，这背后肯定有什么事情，你可记好了。要是他还在这一带的话，我们肯定会听说关于他的事情的……”","“And talk! why, when he got me outside he was ready to weep.Begged and pleaded; gotdown in the snow to me till I hauled him out of it.Palavered around like a crazy man.Swore he’s worked to this very end for years and years, and couldn’t bear to be disappointed now.Asked him what end, but he wouldn’t say.Said they might keep him on the other half of the trail and he would n’t get to Dawson in two years, and then it would be too late.Never saw a man take on so in my life.And when I said I ’d let him have it, had to yank him out of the snow again.Told him to consider it in the light of a grub-stake.Think he’d have it?No, sir!Swore he ’d give me all he found, make me rich beyond the dreams of avarice, and all such stuff.Now a man who puts his life and time against a grub-stake ordinarily finds it hard enough to turn over half of what he finds.Something behind all this, Prince; just you make a note of it.We’ll hear of him if he stays in the country”—"
"“那假如他不呆在这一带呢？”","“And if he doesn’t?”"
"“那就全当我的善心没得到好报，白白没了六十多盎司金子。”","“Then my good nature gets a shock, and I’m sixty some odd ounces out.”"
"寒冷的天气伴随着漫长的黑夜一起到来了，太阳也沿着雪地南面的地平线像往常一样玩起了古老的遮脸的游戏，但是马尔穆特·基德垫出去的那笔钱还是没有一点儿消息。后来，在一月初的一个阴冷的早上，很多狗拉着几架满载的雪橇来到他那个位于斯图尔特河下游的小木屋前。那个用海獭皮换狗的人真的来了，和他一起来的还有另外一个人，那样的身材可能上帝也忘了当初是怎么创造出来的了。大家只要讲到幸运、勇气和一铁锹五百美元的金沙，都会想到阿克塞尔·冈德森这个名字；大伙要是围着营火，说起关于胆量、力气和勇猛的故事，那也肯定要说一说他的事情。而且，每当大家少了谈话的兴致，只要提到跟他有福同享有难同当的那个女人，大家的谈话就又会热烈起来。","The cold weather had come on with the long nights, and the sun had begun to play his ancient game of peekaboo along the southern snow-line ere aught was heard of Malemute Kid’s grub-stake.And then, one bleak morning in early January, a heavily laden dog-train pulled into his cabin below Stuart River.He of the Otter Skins was there, and with him walked a man such as the gods have almost forgotten how to fashion.Men never talked of luck and pluck and five-hundred-dollar dirt without bringing in the name of Axel Gunderson; nor could tales of nerve or strength or daring pass up and down the camp-fire without the summoning of his presence.And when the conversation flagged, it blazed anew at mention of the woman who shared his fortunes."
"前边已经提到过，上帝在创造阿克塞尔·冈德森的时候，想起了他们古时候的手艺，就模仿着洪荒时期的人把他创造出来。他身材高大，足有七英尺高，穿一身漂亮的衣服，就像一位黄金国国王。他的胸膛、脖子和四肢，都和巨人的一样。因为得支撑他重达三百磅的骨头和肌肉，他的雪地鞋要比别人的长一码多。他的脸很粗糙，额头上布满皱纹，下巴宽大，两只浅蓝色的眼睛毫不畏缩，他的这张脸告诉人们他是一个只知道强横霸道的人。他那结了霜的头发，黄得好像熟透了的玉米穗，好像白天横扫黑夜一样，一直披散到他的熊皮大衣上。他在前面领着狗从狭窄的小路上大摇大摆地走过来的模样，隐约透露着一种习惯了海上生活的人的习性；他拿狗鞭子的柄敲打马尔穆特·基德家的门时，就像一个到南方抢劫并狠命进攻城堡大门的北欧海盗。普林斯露着他女人似的胳膊，揉着发酵了的生面团，同时还不停地瞟着这三位客人——三位这样的客人一起走进一个人的家，真是一辈子也难遇见的事。那个被马尔穆特·基德叫做尤利西斯的怪人，依然吸引着他；但是，最吸引他的却是阿克赛尔·冈德森和他的老婆。她走了一天的路，感觉疲惫，因为在他丈夫因得到寒带的金矿矿苗而发迹以后的日子里，她的身体就在舒适惬意的小木屋里变软了。她靠在她丈夫宽厚的胸膛上，就像一株柔嫩的鲜花倚着墙一样，她懒洋洋地回应着马尔穆特·基德善意的逗弄，偶尔用她那深邃的黑眼睛瞟普林斯一眼，使得普林斯莫名其妙地激动起来。因为普林斯是个男人，身体健康，他已经有几个月没怎么见过女人了。而且，她年纪比他大，还是个印第安人。不过，她跟他见过的所有土著女人都不同：她去过很远的地方——他从他们的谈话里了解到她去过很多国家，包括他的故乡；白种女人知道的事情，她差不多都知道，另外她还懂很多女人不该懂的事情。她能把鱼干做成一顿饭，也能在雪地里搭一个床铺；但是她有意逗弄他们，细细描述着精美的食物，提起各种各样他们几乎淡忘的菜肴，搞得他们的肚子都在抗议了。她晓得驼鹿、熊、小蓝狐和北方海里那些野生两栖动物的习性；她对森林里和江河上的事情无所不知，不管人、鸟还是野兽在柔软的雪面上留下什么痕迹，她都一眼就能看出来；普林斯还留意到她看宿营规定时，眼里露出赞赏的目光。这些规定是那个本性难改的贝特尔斯一时兴起制定出来的，语言简洁、诙谐。普林斯总是在女士来以前就把它翻过去，冲着墙；但是谁能想到这个土著女人会……好吧，如今已经晚了。","As has been noted, in the making of Axel Gunderson the gods had remembered their old-time cunning, and cast him after the manner of men who were born when the world was young.Full seven feet he towered in his picturesque costume which marked a king of Eldorado.His chest, neck, and limbs were those of a giant.To bear his three hundred pounds of bone and muscle, his snowshoes were greater by a generous yard than those of other men.Rough-hewn, with rugged brow and massive jaw and unflinching eyes of palest blue, his face told the tale of one who knew but the law of might.Of the yellow of ripe corn silk, his frost-incrusted hair swept like day across the night, and fell far down his coat of bear-skin.A vague tradition of the sea seemed to cling about him, as he swung down the narrow trail in advance of the dogs; and he brought the butt of his dog-whip against Malemute Kid’s door as a Norse sea rover, on southern foray, might thunder for admittance at the castle gate.Prince bared his womanly arms and kneaded sour-dough bread, casting, as he did so, many a glance at the three guests,—three guests the like of which might never come under a man’s roof in a lifetime.The Strange One, whom Malemute Kid had surnamed Ulysses, still fascinated him; but his interest chiefly gravitated between Axel Gunderson and Axel Gunderson’s wife.She felt the day’s journey, for she had softened in comfortable cabins during the many days since her husband mastered the wealth of frozen pay-streaks, and she was tired.She rested against his great breast like a slender flower against a wall, replying lazily to Malemute Kid’s good-natured banter, and stirring Prince’s blood strangely with an occasional sweep of her deep, dark eyes.For Prince was a man, and healthy, and had seen few women in many months.And she was older than he, and an Indian besides.But she was different from all native wives he had met: she had traveled,—had been in his country among others, he gathered from the conversation; and she knew most of the things the women of his own race knew, and much more that it was not in the nature of things for them to know.She could make a meal of sun-dried fish or a bed in the snow; yet she teased them with tantalizing details of many-course dinners, and caused strange internal dissensions to arise at the mention of various quondam dishes which they had well-nigh forgotten.She knew the ways of the moose, the bear, and the little blue fox, and of the wild amphibians of the Northern seas; she was skilled in the lore of the woods and the streams, and the tale writ by man and bird and beast upon the delicate snow crust was to her an open book; yet Prince caught the appreciative twinkle in her eye as she read the Rules of the Camp.These rules had been fathered by the Unquenchable Bettles at a time when his blood ran high, and were remarkable for the terse simplicity of their humor.Prince always turned them to the wall before the arrival of ladies; but who could suspect that this native wife—Well, it was too late now."
"那么，阿克赛尔·冈德森的老婆就是这样一个人，她的名声和她丈夫一起，传遍了整个北方。吃饭时，马尔穆特·基德仗着自己是他们的老朋友，逗弄她，普林斯也丢掉了初次见面的羞怯，跟着一起起哄。尽管敌强我弱，但她仍然能坚守阵地，而她的丈夫，笨嘴拙舌，只能笑着给她鼓掌助威。他为有这样一位妻子感到骄傲；他的每一个表情，每一个动作，都表明了她在他生命中占有非常重要的位置。那个用海獭皮换狗的人一声不吭地吃着饭，在这热闹的交战中他已经被遗忘了；其他人还没吃完，他就离开了桌子，到外面和狗呆在一起了。不过，他刚离开，他的同伴们也很快戴上手套，穿好皮大衣，跟着他出去了。","This, then, was the wife of Axel Gunderson, a woman whose name and fame had traveled with her husband’s, hand in hand, through all the Northland.At table, Malemute Kid baited her with the assurance of an old friend, and Prince shook off the shyness of first acquaintance and joined in.But she held her own in the unequal contest, while her husband, slower in wit, ventured naught but applause.And he was very proud of her; his every look and action revealed the magnitude of the place she occupied in his life.He of the Otter Skins ate in silence, forgotten in the merry battle; and long ere the others were done he pushed back from the table and went out among the dogs.Yet all too soon his fellow travelers drew on their mittens and parkas, and followed him."
"很多天没下雪，雪橇顺着被冻得很结实的育空路一路滑去，就像在光滑的冰面上一样，一点儿都不费力。尤利西斯驾着第一架雪橇，普林斯和阿克赛尔·冈德森的老婆驾着第二架；马尔穆特·基德和那位黄头发的巨人驾着第三架。","There had been no snow for many days, and the sleds slipped along the hard-packed Yukon trail as easily as if it had been glare ice.Ulysses led the first sled; with the second came Prince and Axel Gunderson’s wife; while Malemute Kid and the yellow-haired giant brought up the third."
"“这只是一种‘预感’，基德，”他说，“但是我觉得这事有谱。他从来没去过那里，不过他讲得有板有眼，并且给我看了一张地图，我几年前在库特纳一带就听人说过这张地图。我本打算请你一起去；但是他这个人很古怪，他直截了当地说，要是有别人加入，他就放弃。不过，等我回来以后，我会第一个告诉你，我会把附近的矿给你，再把建造城市的地基分给你一半。","“It ’s only a ‘hunch,’ Kid,” he said; “but I think it ’s straight.He’s never been there, but he tells a good story, and shows a map I heard of when I was in the Kootenay country years ago.I’d like to have you go along; but he ’s a strange one, and swore point-blank to throw it up if any one was brought in.But when I come back you ’ll get first tip, and I’ll stake you next to me, and give you a half share in the town site besides."
"“不！不！”他大叫，因为对方想打断他的话。“这事我做主，在事情没办完之前，需要有个人商议一下。要是这事牢靠的话，那就是第二个克里普尔克甲克了，老兄，你听见了吗？第二个克里普尔克甲克！那可是石英金矿，你要知道，可不是砂矿；要是我们干对了路子，我们就能把整个矿都搞到手——那就是成百上千万了。我过去听说过这个地方，你肯定也听说过。我们要建造一座城镇——雇几千名工人——开一条水路——汽船航道——大笔的运输生意——开向上游的浅水轮船——可能，再勘测一条铁路——几家锯木厂——电厂——还有自己的银行——商业公司——大财团——哎呀！我回来之前，你千万别跟被人讲！”","“No! no!” he cried, as the other strove to interrupt.“I’m running this, and before I’m done it’ll need two heads.If it’s all right, why it’ll be a second Cripple Creek, man; do you hear?—a second Cripple Creek!It’s quartz, you know, not placer; and if we work it right we’ll corral the whole thing,—millions upon millions.I’ve heard of the place before, and so have you.We’ll build a town—thousands of workmen—good waterways—steamship lines—big carrying trade—light-draught steamers for head-reaches—survey a railroad, perhaps—sawmills—electric-light plant—do our own banking—commercial company—syndicate—Say! just you hold your hush till I get back!”"
"在这条路经过斯图尔特河口处，雪橇停住了。一片连绵不断的冰海，远远地向没有人知道的东部延伸。他们把绑在雪橇上的雪地鞋解了下来。阿克赛尔·冈德森同他们握了握手，就走到最前面，他那双巨大的像蹼一样的雪地鞋，在柔软的雪里，足足陷下半码深，把雪压得实实的，这样狗就不会陷进雪里了。他的老婆在最后一架雪橇后面跟着，她很熟练地踩着那双笨拙的雪地鞋，看得出来她在这方面是经过长期训练的。愉快的道别声打破了静寂；狗狂吠着；而那个用海獭皮换狗的人正在拿鞭子教训一只不听话的狗。","The sleds came to a halt where the trail crossed the mouth of Stuart River.An unbroken sea of frost, its wide expanse stretched away into the unknown east.The snowshoes were withdrawn from the lashings of the sleds.Axel Gunderson shook hands and stepped to the fore, his great webbed shoes sinking a fair half yard into the feathery surface and packing the snow so the dogs should not wallow.His wife fell in behind the last sled, betraying long practice in the art of handling the awkward footgear.The stillness was broken with cheery farewells; the dogs whined; and He of the Otter Skins talked with his whip to a recalcitrant wheeler."
"一个小时以后，这一队雪橇仿佛一支黑色铅笔一样，在这张白色的大纸上画了一条长长的直线。","An hour later, the train had taken on the likeness of a black pencil crawling in a long, straight line across a mighty sheet of foolscap."
"过了几周，一天晚上，马尔穆特·基德和普林斯发现了一页从旧杂志上撕下来的纸，正在钻研上面的棋谱。基德刚从他的博南扎矿山上回来，想先歇息一下，然后会花很长一段时间去捕驼鹿。普林斯差不多整个冬天都是在河道上和雪路上度过的，他也想在这木屋里舒舒服服呆上一个星期。","One night, many weeks later, Malemute Kid and Prince fell to solving chess problems from the torn page of an ancient magazine.The Kid had just returned from his Bonanza properties, and was resting up preparatory to a long moose hunt.Prince too had been on creek and trail nearly all winter, and had grown hungry for a blissful week of cabin life."
"“让黑骑士跳上去，将军。不行，不管用。你看，下面这一步……”","“Interpose the black knight, and force the king.No, that won’t do.See, the next move”—"
"“怎么让卒子进两格呢？应该用它来换子，要是吃了主教……”","“Why advance the pawn two squares?Bound to take it in transit, and with the bishop out of the way”—"
"“等等！那就有漏洞了，而且……”","“But hold on!That leaves a hole, and”—"
"“不可能，肯定没事。走过去！你看着吧，这样肯定行。”","“No; it ’s protected.Go ahead!You’ll see it works.”"
"这局棋很有意思。有人叩了两次门，马尔穆特·基德才说了声“请进”。门被推开了。一个家伙踉踉跄跄地走进来。普林斯抬头一看，不禁跳了起来。他眼里的恐惧使得马尔穆特·基德赶紧转身；他也给吓坏了，虽然他以前见过很多危险的事。那个家伙莽莽撞撞地朝着他们踉跄着走过去。普林斯缓缓往后退，直到够到了那个挂着他的史密斯·威森刀具的钉子。","It was very interesting.Somebody knocked at the door a second time before Malemute Kid said, “Come in.”The door swung open.Something staggered in.Prince caught one square look, and sprang to his feet.The horror in his eyes caused Malemute Kid to whirl about; and he too was startled, though he had seen bad things before.The thing tottered blindly toward them.Prince edged away till he reached the nail from which hung his Smith & Wesson."
"“天哪！这是个什么东西？”他小声问马尔穆特·基德。","“My God! What is it?” he whispered to Malemute Kid."
"“不知道。他像是冻坏了，还没吃过东西。”基德一边回答，一边溜向相反的方向。“小心！没准是个疯子。”他关上门返回来的时候提醒道。","“Don’t know.Looks like a case of freezing and no grub,” replied the Kid, sliding away in the opposite direction.“Watch out!It may be mad,” he warned, coming back from closing the door."
"那个家伙走到了桌子旁边。油灯的亮光照着它的眼睛。它很快活，发出吓人的咯咯声，表示它很高兴。然后，他——原来是个人——突然往后一偏，扎紧了皮裤，唱起了水手的起锚号子，就像水手们在波涛轰鸣中转动绞盘时唱的歌：","The thing advanced to the table.The bright flame of the slush-lamp caught its eye.It was amused, and gave voice to eldritch cackles which betokened mirth.Then, suddenly, he—for it was a man—swayed back, with a hitch to his skin trousers, and began to sing a chanty, such as men lift when they swing around the capstan circle and the sea snorts in their ears:"
"拉呀！好小子！使劲拉！想知道谁是船长？拉呀！好小子！使劲拉！乔纳森·琼斯来自南卡罗来纳州，拉呀！好小子……","Pull! My bully boys!Pull!D’yeh want—to know de captain ru-uns her?Pull! My bully boys!Pull!Jon-a-than Jones ob South Caho-li-in-a,Pull! My bully”—"
"他突然停住了，像狼一样叫了一声，同时踉跄着往搁肉的架子走过去，他们还没来得及拦住他，他的牙已经咬住了一块生腌肉。他和马尔穆特·基德的争夺很凶猛；但是他那股疯劲来去匆匆，他虚弱地把夺来的肉交了出去。他们将他抬到一张凳子上，他把半个身子都伏在桌子上。一小杯威士忌让他有了精神，马尔穆特·基德把一罐子糖搁在他面前，他已经能拿着勺子舀糖了。等他的食欲满足了一些，普林斯一边颤抖着，一边递给他一杯淡牛肉汤。","He broke off abruptly, tottered with a wolfish snarl to the meat-shelf, and before they could intercept was tearing with his teeth at a chunk of raw bacon.The struggle was fierce between him and Malemute Kid; but his mad strength left him as suddenly as it had come, and he weakly surrendered the spoil.Between them they got him upon a stool, where he sprawled with half his body across the table.A small dose of whiskey strengthened him, so that he could dip a spoon into the sugar caddy which Malemute Kid placed before him.After his appetite had been somewhat cloyed, Prince, shuddering as he did so, passed him a mug of weak beef tea."
"那个家伙眼睛里发出一种阴郁的、疯狂的光，每吃一口，这种光就随着一闪一灭。他面部的皮肤已经不多了。所以，这张深陷的、消瘦的面孔几乎没有一点儿像人脸的地方了。接连不断的严寒冻坏了他的脸，上一次冻出来的伤疤还没痊愈，新的伤疤又叠在了上面。表皮又干又硬，呈黑紫色，还有好几道深深的锯齿一样的裂纹，里面的红肉都露了出来。他的皮衣肮脏破烂，一面的毛已经被烧焦了，有的地方甚至完全烧没了，他的那一侧身子睡觉的时候肯定曾经紧挨着火。","The creature’s eyes were alight with a sombre frenzy, which blazed and waned with every mouthful.There was very little skin to the face.The face, for that matter, sunken and emaciated, bore very little likeness to human countenance.Frost after frost had bitten deeply, each depositing its stratum of scab upon the half-healed scar that went before.This dry, hard surface was of a bloody-black color, serrated by grievous cracks wherein the raw red flesh peeped forth.His skin garments were dirty and in tatters, and the fur of one side was singed and burned away, showing where he had lain upon his fire."
"马尔穆特·基德指着他那件被太阳晒黑了的皮衣上割成一道一道的地方——残忍的、饥饿的记号。","Malemute Kid pointed to where the sun-tanned hide had been cut away, strip by strip,—the grim signature of famine."
"“你——是——谁？”基德问，他说得很慢，发音清晰。","“Who—are—you?” slowly and distinctly enunciated the Kid."
"那人没留意他的话。","The man paid no heed."
"“你从什么地方来的？”","“Where do you come from?”"
"“美国船顺流而来。”他用颤抖的嗓音唱了一句，当作是回答。","“Yan-kee ship come down de ri-ib-er,” was the quavering response."
"“毫无疑问，这个乞丐肯定是沿着河走来的。”基德边说边摇晃着他，试图让他说得更清楚点儿。","“Don’t doubt the beggar came down the river,” the Kid said, shaking him in an endeavor to start a more lucid flow of talk."
"但是基德一碰到他，他就尖声大叫起来，一只手捂住腰，很明显是由疼痛所致。他缓缓站起来，半靠着桌子。","But the man shrieked at the contact, clapping a hand to his side in evident pain.He rose slowly to his feet, half leaning on the table."
"“她嘲笑我——就这样——眼里含着恨；她——不——愿——来。”","“She laughed at me—so—with the hate in her eye; and she—would—not—come.”"
"他的声音减弱，身子向后倒去。此时，马尔穆特·基德紧握住他的手腕，喊道：“谁？谁不愿来？”","His voice died away, and he was sinking back when Malemute Kid gripped him by the wrist, and shouted, “Who?Who would not come?”"
"“她，昂加。她嘲笑我，打我，就这样。然后——”","“She, Unga.She laughed, and struck at me, so, and so.And then”—"
"“嗯？”","“Yes?”"
"“然后——”","“And then”—"
"“然后怎么了？”","“And then what?”"
"“然后他一动不动地躺在雪里，躺了很长时间。他——还在——雪里。”","“And then he lay very still, in the snow, a long time.He is—still in—the—snow.”"
"两个人互相看着对方，不知道怎么办。","The two men looked at each other helplessly."
"“谁在雪里？”","“Who is in the snow?”"
"“她，昂加。她眼里含着恨盯着我，然后——”","“She, Unga.She looked at me with the hate in her eye, and then”—"
"“嗯，嗯。”","“Yes, yes.”"
"“然后她拿起刀，就这样，一刀，两刀——她很虚弱。我走得很慢。那个地方有许多金子，非常多的金子。”","“And then she took the knife, so; and once, twice—she was weak.I traveled very slow.And there is much gold in that place, very much gold.”"
"“昂加在什么地方？”从马尔穆特·基德能够听懂的话里推断，她可能就在离他们一英里的地方，就快死了。他拼命摇晃着那个人，一遍又一遍地问：“昂加在什么地方？谁是昂加？”","“Where is Unga?”For all Malemute Kid knew, she might be dying a mile away.He shook the man savagely, repeating again and again, “Where is Unga?Who is Unga?”"
"“她——在——雪——里。”","“She—is—in—the—snow.”"
"“接着说！”基德使劲按住他的手腕。","“Go on!”The Kid was pressing his wrist cruelly."
"“所以——我——本来——想——呆在——雪里——但是——我——得——还——一笔债。它——很——重——我——得——还——一笔——债——得——还——一笔——债——我——得——”他时断时续，单个字单个字的话停下了，他的手在口袋里摸索着，掏出了一个鹿皮口袋。“得——还——一笔——债——五——磅——金子——贷——款——马——尔——穆——特——基德——我——”他的脑袋无力地撞到了桌子上；马尔穆特·基德再也不能把他扶起来了。","“So—I—would—be—in—the snow—but—I—had—debt—to—pay.It—was—heavy—I—had—a—debt—to—pay—a—debt—to—pay—I—had”—The faltering monosyllables ceased, as he fumbled in his pouch and drew forth a buckskin sack.“A—debt—to—pay—five—pounds—of—gold—grub—stake—Mal—e—mute—Kid—I”—The exhausted head dropped upon the table; nor could Malemute Kid rouse it again."
"“是尤利西斯。”他平静地说道，同时把那袋子金子扔到桌子上。“看来阿克赛尔·冈德森跟那个女人都完了。来吧，咱们把他架到床上，给他盖上毯子。他是个印第安人；他肯定会摆脱危险的，没准还会给我们讲个故事呢。”","“It’s Ulysses,” he said quietly, tossing the bag of dust on the table.“Guess it’s all day with Axel Gunderson and the woman.Come on, let ’s get him between the blankets.He’s Indian; he’ll pull through, and tell a tale besides.”"
"他们把他身上的衣服割下来的时候，只见他右边的胸口处有两处没有长好的刀疤，伤口已经变硬了。","As they cut his garments from him, near his right breast could be seen two unhealed, hard-lipped knife thrusts."
"“我想讲讲我亲身经历过的事情；你们应该会懂的。我想从头讲起，讲讲我自己跟那个女人，之后，还要讲讲那个男人。”","“I will talk of the things which were, in my own way; but you will understand.I will begin at the beginning, and tell of myself and the woman, and, after that, of the man.”"
"这个用海獭皮换狗的人往火炉边靠了靠，他就像是一个丢了火种的人，担心普罗米修斯的礼物不知道什么时候就消失了。马尔穆特·基德拨亮了油灯，把它换了个位置，好让它能照着讲故事的人的脸。普林斯把身子从床那边移过来，也加入了他们。","He of the Otter Skins drew over to the stove as do men who have been deprived of fire and are afraid the Promethean gift may vanish at any moment.Malemute Kid pricked up the slush-lamp, and placed it so its light might fall upon the face of the narrator.Prince slid his body over the edge of the bunk and joined them."
"“我叫纳斯，我是一个酋长，也是酋长的儿子，在日落之后、日出之前的黑暗的大海上，我生在父亲的皮船上。整个晚上，男人们不停地划桨，女人们把扑到我们船上的海浪泼出去，我们和暴风雨搏斗着。带着盐味的海水在我母亲胸前冻住了，海浪退下去的时候，她的呼吸也随之停止了。但是我——我在暴风雨中提高了嗓门，总算保住了这条命。","“I am Naass, a chief, and the son of a chief, born between a sunset and a rising, on the dark seas, in my father’s oomiak.All of a night the men toiled at the paddles, and the women cast out the waves which threw in upon us, and we fought with the storm.The salt spray froze upon my mother’s breast till her breath passed with the passing of the tide.But I,—I raised my voice with the wind and the storm, and lived."
"“我们居住在阿卡屯——”","“We dwelt in Akatan”—"
"“什么地方？”马尔穆特·基德问。","“Where?” asked Malemute Kid."
"“阿卡屯，在阿留申群岛；阿卡屯，比奇格尼克岛、卡尔达拉克岛和乌尼马克岛都远。就像我说的，我们居住在阿卡屯，在大海中间，在世界的尽头。我们在咸海里捕鱼、捉海豹和海獭；我们的房子是紧挨在一起的，位于树林边缘和黄色沙滩中间的岩石带上，我们的皮船就停在那片沙滩上。我们的人很少，我们的世界也不大。东边有一些陌生的地方——都是和阿卡屯一样的岛屿；所以我们就认为整个世界都是岛，也并不在意。“我和我族里的人不一样。沙滩上有一些弯曲的船骨和几块被海浪打弯的船板，我族里从来没有人造过这样的船；我记得在那三面环海的岛的边缘，有一棵笔直整齐又高大的松树，也是以前岛上没有的。听说过去有两个男人去了那个地方，他们到处转悠，在那里呆了好多天，从日出望到日落。这两个人乘着船从海外来，而他们的船已经成了碎片，散落在沙滩上。他们的皮肤跟你们的一样白，身体虚弱得就像海豹已经逃掉，猎户两手空空回到家时饿肚子的小孩子似的。这些事情我都是从那些上了年纪的人那里听到的，他们又是听自己的祖辈们说的。这两个外来的白人刚开始不喜欢我们的生活习惯，但是吃了鱼和油以后，他们变得壮实而且凶猛。他们还自己建了房子，娶了我们最棒的女人，最后还生了孩子。就这样，我父亲的父亲的父亲就出生了。","“Akatan, which is in the Aleutians; Akatan, beyond Chignik, beyond Kardalak, beyond Unimak.As I say, we dwelt in Akatan, which lies in the midst of the sea on the edge of the world.We farmed the salt seas for the fish, the seal, and the otter; and our homes shouldered about one another on the rocky strip between the rim of the forest and the yellow beach where our kayaks lay.We were not many, and the world was very small.There were strange lands to the east,—islands like Akatan; so we thought all the world was islands, and did not mind.“I was different from my people.In the sands of the beach were the crooked timbers and wave-warped planks of a boat such as my people never built; and I remember on the point of the island which overlooked the ocean three ways there stood a pine tree which never grew there, smooth and straight and tall.It is said the two men came to that spot, turn about, through many days, and watched with the passing of the light.These two men came from out of the sea in the boat which lay in pieces on the beach.And they were white like you, and weak as the little children when the seal have gone away and the hunters come home empty.I know of these things from the old men and the old women, who got them from their fathers and mothers before them.These strange white men did not take kindly to our ways at first, but they grew strong, what of the fish and the oil, and fierce.And they built them each his own house, and took the pick of our women, and in time children came.Thus he was born who was to become the father of my father’s father."
"“我刚讲过，我和我族里的人不一样，因为我体内流着那个从海外来的壮实的白人的血液。听说，在这两个白人到来之前，我们原本有另外一套规矩；但是这两个人不但凶猛，还爱吵架，他们总是和我们族里的人打架，直到最后，没有人敢跟他们打了。最后，他们自立为酋长，打破了我们以前的规矩，另立了新的规矩，规定男人是他父亲的儿子，而不和我们过去一样，男人是母亲的儿子。他们还规定，第一个生下来的儿子有权利继承他父亲所有的东西，而他的兄弟姐妹就得自谋出路。他们还给我们立了别的规矩。他们教我们用新的方法捕鱼捉熊，我们树林里的熊可多了；他们还教我们多储存东西，以免遇到饥荒。这些都是好事。","“As I said, I was different from my people, for I carried the strong, strange blood of this white man who came out of the sea.It is said we had other laws in the days before these men; but they were fierce and quarrelsome, and fought with our men till there were no more left who dared to fight.Then they made themselves chiefs, and took away our old laws and gave us new ones, insomuch that the man was the son of his father, and not his mother, as our way had been.They also ruled that the son, firstborn, should have all things which were his father’s before him, and that the brothers and sisters should shift for themselves.And they gave us other laws.They showed us new ways in the catching of fish and the killing of bear which were thick in the woods; and they taught us to lay by bigger stores for the time of famine.And these things were good."
"“但是他们当了酋长以后，再没有人敢惹他们了，这两个外来的白人开始互相残杀。其中一个，也就是我继承了他血统的那个人，那时就把刺海豹的鱼叉扎进另外一个人身上有一胳膊深。这样，他们的孩子就不断地斗下去，接着是他们的孩子的孩子；他们非常恨对方，经常互相伤害，甚至到了我这一辈还是这样，以至于每家只有一个人能延续香火。我们家里，只剩下我自己；那一家只剩下一个女儿，叫昂加，和她母亲一起生活。一天夜里，他的父亲和我的父亲出海捕鱼就没有回来；后来，大潮把他们冲上岸，两个人仍然紧紧地扭打在一起。","“But when they had become chiefs, and there were no more men to face their anger, they fought, these strange white men, each with the other.And the one whose blood I carry drove his seal spear the length of an arm through the other’s body.Their children took up the fight, and their children’s children; and there was great hatred between them, and black doings, even to my time, so that in each family but one lived to pass down the blood of them that went before.Of my blood I was alone; of the other man’s there was but a girl, Unga, who lived with her mother.Her father and my father did not come back from the fishing one night; but afterward they washed up to the beach on the big tides, and they held very close to each other."
"“人们都惊讶于我们两家的仇恨，岁数大的人都一边摇头一边说，等她有了孩子，我也有了孩子，这个仗还要打下去。我小的时候他们就这么跟我讲，直到后来我也信了，把昂加看做是仇人，认为以后她的孩子一定会跟我的孩子打仗。我每天都在想这些事，等到我长大了，我就问他们为什么一定要到这种地步。他们答道：‘我们不知道，只知道你们的父辈就是这么做的。’我很纳闷，死了的人打的仗竟然非得让后来的人接着打下去，而且我确实不知道有什么道理可言。但是大家都说必须得这样，而我当时还不过是个小伙子。","“The people wondered, because of the hatred between the houses, and the old men shook their heads and said the fight would go on when children were born to her and children to me.They told me this as a boy, till I came to believe, and to look upon Unga as a foe, who was to be the mother of children which were to fight with mine.I thought of these things day by day, and when I grew to a stripling I came to ask why this should be so.And they answered, ‘We do not know, but that in such way your fathers did.’ And I marveled that those which were to come should fight the battles of those that were gone, and in it I could see no right.But the people said it must be, and I was only a stripling."
"“他们还说，我必须抓紧，这样我的孩子就会比她的孩子先成熟，先壮实起来。这很简单，我是酋长，因为我祖先的功绩和他们立下的规矩，以及我自己的财产，大家都很尊重我。什么样的姑娘都愿意嫁给我，但是我一个也看不上。那些年纪大的人和那些姑娘的母亲都催我要抓紧，因为那个时候很多猎手正向昂加的母亲开出大宗的聘礼；要是她的孩子比我的孩子壮实得早的话，我的孩子肯定会没命的。","“And they said I must hurry, that my blood might be the older and grow strong before hers.This was easy, for I was head man, and the people looked up to me because of the deeds and the laws of my fathers, and the wealth which was mine.Any maiden would come to me, but I found none to my liking.And the old men and the mothers of maidens told me to hurry, for even then were the hunters bidding high to the mother of Unga; and should her children grow strong before mine, mine would surely die."
"“我还是没有选中一位称心的姑娘，直到有一天傍晚我捕鱼回来。太阳正要落山，低沉的日光照射着我的眼睛，风很顺，几只皮船乘着白色的海浪疾驰过来。突然昂加的皮船从我旁边驶过，她看了我一眼，她乌黑的头发飘舞着，像黑夜的云彩，脸颊被浪花打得湿漉漉的。我刚讲过，太阳光照着我的眼睛，我还是个小伙子；但是不知怎么回事，我恍然大悟，这就是所谓的情投意合。等她划船前进的时候，刚划了两下，又回过头来看我——只有昂加这样的女人才会这样看人——我知道这还是那样的表示。我们超过那些慢吞吞的大皮船，把它们远远落在后面的时候，大家都替我们叫好。但是她快速地划着桨，我的心像一张满帆，不过我没赶上她。风力变强了，海上是雪白的浪，船像海豹一样迎风飞驰，我们朝着海面上那缕金色的阳光呼啸而去。”","“Nor did I find a maiden till one night coming back from the fishing.The sunlight was lying, so, low and full in the eyes, the wind free, and the kayaks racing with the white seas.Of a sudden the kayak of Unga came driving past me, and she looked upon me, so, with her black hair flying like a cloud of night and the spray wet on her cheek.As say, the sunlight was full in the eyes, and I was a stripling; but somehow it was all clear, and I knew it to be the call of kind to kind.As she whipped ahead she looked back within the space of two strokes,—looked as only the woman Unga could look,—and again I knew it as the call of kind.The people shouted as we ripped past the lazy oomiaks and left them far behind.But she was quick at the paddle, and my heart was like the belly of a sail, and I did not gain.The wind freshened, the sea whitened, and, leaping like the seals on the windward breech, we roared down the golden pathway of the sun.”"
"纳斯弯着身子，已有一半身体离开了凳子，他摆出一副划桨的姿势，就像又在比赛一样。在炉子对面的某个地方，他似乎看到了那只上下颠簸的橡皮船和昂加飞扬的头发。他的耳朵似乎听见了风声，鼻孔里似乎也充满了海水的咸味。","Naass was crouched half out of his stool, in the attitude of one driving a paddle, as he ran the race anew.Somewhere across the stove he beheld the tossing kayak and the flying hair of Unga.The voice of the wind was in his ears, and its salt beat fresh upon his nostrils."
"“但是她上岸了，跑到沙滩上，笑着跑回她母亲的房子。那一晚，我有了一个极好的想法——一个无愧是阿卡屯全体人民领袖的想法。于是，当月亮升起的时候，我就来到她母亲的房子前边，看了看雅希—奴希堆在她门前的那些东西——这是雅希—奴希的聘礼，他是一个身体强壮的猎手，想当昂加孩子的父亲。其他几个年轻人也曾把东西堆在那里，后来又拿走了；而且每个年轻人堆放的东西都比前边的小伙子堆放得多一些。","“But she made the shore, and ran up the sand, laughing, to the house of her mother.And a great thought came to me that night,—a thought worthy of him that was chief over all the people of Akatan.So, when the moon was up, I went down to the house of her mother, and looked upon the goods of Yash-Noosh, which were piled by the door,—the goods of Yash-Noosh, a strong hunter who had it in mind to be the father of the children of Unga.Other young men had piled their goods there, and taken them away again; and each young man had made a pile greater than the one before."
"“我对着月亮和星星笑了起来，回到自己的房子里，那里储存着我的财产。我搬了好几趟，直到我的东西比雅希—奴希的那堆高出一只手为止。那里有晒干的鱼和烟熏的鱼；有海豹皮四十张，毛皮二十张，每张皮都扎着口，肚子里是满满的鱼油；还有熊皮十张，那是春天熊出现时我在树林子里打回来的。那里还有珠子、毛毯和鲜红色的布，这些都是我和东边的人换来的，而他们又是和住在更东边的人换来的。我看着雅希—奴希的那一堆东西笑了；因为我是阿卡屯的酋长，我的财产比那些小伙子的都多，我的祖先们曾立下功绩，还立了很多规矩，使得他们的名字流芳百世。","“And I laughed to the moon and the stars, and went to my own house where my wealth was stored.And many trips I made, till my pile was greater by the fingers of one hand than the pile of Yash-Noosh.There were fish, dried in the sun and smoked; and forty hides of the hair seal, and half as many of the fur, and each hide was tied at the mouth and big-bellied with oil; and ten skins of bear which I killed in the woods when they came out in the spring.And there were beads and blankets and scarlet cloths, such as I got in trade from the people who lived to the east, and who got them in trade from the people who lived still beyond in the east.And I looked upon the pile of Yash-Noosh and laughed; for I was head man in Akatan, and my wealth was greater than the wealth of all my young men, and my fathers had done deeds, and given laws, and put their names for all time in the mouths of the people."
"“所以天刚亮，我就到沙滩上去，用余光看着昂加母亲的房子。我的聘礼还原封不动地堆在那里。女人们都在笑，还偷偷地议论着。我很纳闷，因为从没有一个人出过这么多聘礼；那天晚上，我又多放了一些东西，还在旁边放了一只从没出过海的、硝得很好的皮舟。但是到白天的时候它还是堆在那里，成了所有人的笑柄。昂加的母亲太狡猾了，我很生气，我不能在我族人的面前受这样的羞辱。所以，当天晚上我又放了很多东西，让它成了大大的一堆，另外，我还把我的大皮船也拖到了岸上，这只船可抵得上二十只皮舟。于是，清晨的时候，那堆东西都不见了。","“So, when the morning came, I went down to the beach, casting out of the corner of my eye at the house of the mother of Unga.My offer yet stood untouched.And the women smiled, and said sly things one to the other.I wondered, for never had such a price been offered; and that night I added more to the pile, and put beside it a kayak of well-tanned skins which never yet had swam in the sea.But in the day it was yet there, open to the laughter of all men.The mother of Unga was crafty, and I grew angry at the shame in which I stood before my people.So that night I added till it became a great pile, and I hauled up my oomiak, which was of the value of twenty kayaks.And in the morning there was no pile."
"“然后我就开始准备婚礼，连住在东边的人都来了，因为宴会上的食物很丰盛，还有送给客人的礼物。昂加比我年纪大，大四个太阳，这是我们计算年龄的方式。我只是个小伙子；不过我是酋长，还是酋长的儿子，因此也没什么问题。","“Then made I preparation for the wedding, and the people that lived even to the east came for the food of the feast and the potlach token.Unga was older than I by the age of four suns in the way we reckoned the years.I was only a stripling; but then I was a chief, and the son of a chief, and it did not matter."
"“但是有一艘船从海平面上露出帆来，在风的推动下，船越来越近了。船的排水口处正淌出清清的水，船上的人正在急急忙忙地拼命抽动水泵。一个身材魁梧的人站在船头，一边瞧着水的深浅，一边下命令，他声如洪钟。他淡蓝色的眼睛像深水一样，他的头发像海狮的鬃毛。而且，他的头发是黄颜色的，就像南方人收割的稻草，又像是水手编织的马尼拉麻绳。","“But a ship shoved her sails above the floor of the ocean, and grew larger with the breath of the wind.From her scuppers she ran clear water, and the men were in haste and worked hard at the pumps.On the bow stood a mighty man, watching the depth of the water and giving commands with a voice of thunder.His eyes were of the pale blue of the deep waters, and his head was maned like that of a sea lion.And his hair was yellow, like the straw of a southern harvest or the manila rope-yarns which sailormen plait."
"“前些年，我们也见过很多从远方来的大船，但是这艘船是第一个在阿卡屯靠岸的。宴会停止了，女人和孩子们都跑回家里，而我们这些男人都拉好了弓，手持长矛，等着那伙人过来。但是，船头靠上岸以后，那些陌生人根本没注意到我们，他们在忙活自己的事情。潮退了以后，他们就把这艘双桅帆船翻过来，开始修补船底的那个大窟窿。就这样，女人们都又悄悄回来了，宴会继续。","“Of late years we had seen ships from afar, but this was the first to come to the beach of Akatan.The feast was broken, and the women and children fled to the houses, while we men strung our bows and waited with spears in hand.But when the ship’s forefoot smelt the beach the strange men took no notice of us, being busy with their own work.With the falling of the tide they careened the schooner and patched a great hole in her bottom.So the women crept back, and the feast went on."
"“等到涨潮的时候，那伙漂泊在海上的人就在海水较深的地方抛下了锚，接着便来到我们中间。他们拿来一些礼物，态度也很友好；所以我就给他们腾了些地方，而且像对待其他客人一样，也很大方地送了他们一些礼物；因为这是我成亲的日子，何况我还是阿卡屯的酋长。那个头发像海狮鬃毛一样的男人也来了，他长得又高又壮，让人觉得他的脚一踩下去，地面都会颤抖一样。他双臂交叉放在胸前，总是直勾勾地盯着昂加看，就这样，一直到太阳下山、星星出现的时候。然后他才回到自己的船上。之后，我就拉着昂加，把她带到我家。大家在我家里又唱又笑，女人们开着玩笑，就像女人们平常在婚礼上那样。但是我们并不在意。最后，大家留下我们两个人，各自回家了。","“When the tide rose, the sea wanderers kedged the schooner to deep water, and then came among us.They bore presents and were friendly; so I made room for them, and out of the largeness of my heart gave them tokens such as I gave all the guests; for it was my wedding day, and I was head man in Akatan.And he with the mane of the sea lion was there, so tall and strong that one looked to see the earth shake with the fall of his feet.He looked much and straight at Unga, with his arms folded, so, and stayed till the sun went away and the stars came out.Then he went down to his ship.After that I took Unga by the hand and led her to my own house.And there was singing and great laughter, and the women said sly things, after the manner of women at such times.But we did not care.Then the people left us alone and went home."
"“喧闹的声音还没有消失，那群海上漂泊的人的首领就走进门来。他手里拿着几个黑瓶子，我们一起喝着瓶子里的东西，喝得很尽兴。你要知道，我那时不过是个小伙子，又一直生活在世界的尽头。因此，我的血液热得像火，我的心轻飘飘的，就像是从浪头飞到峭壁上的泡沫一样。昂加安静地坐在角落里一堆皮子上，她大睁着眼睛，仿佛有些害怕。那个头发像海豹鬃毛的家伙，就一直直勾勾地盯着她看，看了好久。后来他的人进来了，带着一捆捆的货物，他把这些货物堆到我跟前，这些都是阿卡屯没有的东西。货物有大小不一的枪支，有火药、子弹和炮弹，有亮闪闪的斧子、钢刀和灵巧的工具，还有很多我从来没看到过的古里古怪的东西。当时，他用手势告诉我，这些东西都归我了，我觉得他这么慷慨，真是个伟大的人；但是他又告诉我，得让昂加上他的船，和他一起离开。你明白吗？——让昂加上他的船跟他走。我祖宗的血液突然间变得滚烫，我拿起长矛，想把他的身体刺穿。但是瓶子里的烈酒已经让我胳膊上失去了力气，他揪住我的脖子，就这样，把我的头往房子里的墙上撞去。我被撞得毫无力气，就像一个刚出生的孩子，两条腿都站不稳了。当他把昂加往门口拽的时候，昂加尖叫着，同时用手乱抓房子里的东西，弄得那些东西在我们周围倒了一地。后来，他用他那粗壮的胳膊把昂加抱了起来，她撕扯着他的黄头发，但是他却像一只在发情期的大雄海豹一样放声大笑。","“The last noise had not died away, when the chief of the sea wanderers came in by the door.And he had with him black bottles, from which we drank and made merry.You see, I was only a stripling, and had lived all my days on the edge of the world.So my blood became as fire, and my heart as light as the froth that flies from the surf to the cliff.Unga sat silent among the skins in the corner, her eyes wide, for she seemed to fear.And he with the mane of the sea lion looked upon her straight and long.Then his men came in with bundles of goods, and he piled before me wealth such as was not in all Akatan.There were guns, both large and small, and powder and shot and shell, and bright axes and knives of steel, and cunning tools, and strange things the like of which I had never seen.When he showed me by sign that it was all mine, I thought him a great man to be so free; but, he showed me also that Unga was to go away with him in his ship.Do you understand?—that Unga was to go away with him in his ship.The blood of my fathers flamed hot on the sudden, and I made to drive him through with my spear.But the spirit of the bottles had stolen the life from my arm, and he took me by the neck, so, and knocked my head against the wall of the house.And I was made weak like a newborn child, and my legs would no more stand under me.Unga screamed, and she laid hold of the things of the house with her hands, till they fell all about us as he dragged her to the door.Then he took her in his great arms, and when she tore at his yellow hair laughed with a sound like that of the big bull seal in the rut."
"“我爬到沙滩上把我的族人叫出来；但是他们都怕那伙人。只有雅希—奴希是个堂堂正正的男子汉，但是那伙人拿桨打他的头，直打得他脸朝下伏在沙滩上，不能动弹为止。然后，他们便扬起帆，唱着歌，借着风势把船开走了。","“I crawled to the beach and called upon my people; but they were afraid.Only Yash-Noosh was a man, and they struck him on the head with an oar, till he lay with his face in the sand anddid not move.And they raised the sails to the sound of their songs, and the ship went away on the wind."
"“大家都说，这样也好，这样阿卡屯就不会再有打仗流血的事了；但是我一句话都没说，一直等到月圆的那天，我把鱼和油放到皮舟上，往东边走了。我看见许多岛和许多人，我这个在世界尽头生活的人，到这一刻才知道世界居然这么大。我用手势跟他们交谈；但是他们根本没看见过什么双桅船，也没有看见过那个头发像海豹鬃毛的家伙，他们始终指着东面。我在各种奇怪的地方睡觉，吃了各类罕见的食物，看见了各种陌生的面孔。许多人都笑话我，以为我脑子有毛病；但是有时候，一些年纪大的人会让我对着阳光，为我祈福；还有一些年轻女人，在她们询问我那只外来的船、昂加和那些海上来的人时，她们的眼里透着温柔。","“The people said it was good, for there would be no more war of the bloods in Akatan; but I said never a word, waiting till the time of the full moon, when I put fish and oil in my kayak, and went away to the east.I saw many islands and many people, and I, who had lived on the edge, saw that the world was very large.I talked by signs; but they had not seen a schooner nor a man with the mane of a sea lion, and they pointed always to the east.And I slept in queer places, and ate odd things, and met strange faces.Many laughed, for they thought me light of head; but sometimes old men turned my face to the light and blessed me, and the eyes of the young women grew soft as they asked me of the strange ship, and Unga, and the men of the sea."
"“就这样，我越过波涛汹涌的大海，顶着狂风暴雨，来到了乌纳拉斯卡。那里有两艘双桅船，但是没有一艘是我要找的。所以，我继续往东走，我眼前的世界也变得越来越大。但是不管在乌纳莫克岛、科迪亚克岛，还是在阿托格纳岛，都没有一点儿关于那艘船的消息。一天，我到了一个有很多岩石的地方，那里的人们在山里挖了很多大洞。那里有一艘双桅帆船，但不是我要找的那艘，那些人把他们挖出来的石块往船上搬。我觉得这种事情像小孩子的把戏，因为这世上到处都是岩石；但是他们给我吃的，还硬让我干活。等到船吃水深的时候，船长给了我些钱，让我离开；我问他要去哪里，他指着南方。我打着手势说，我想跟他一起走；他先笑了笑，后来，因为船上缺人手，他就让我呆在船上帮忙干活。于是，我就学着他们的腔调说话，帮忙拽锚索，在突然刮起大风的时候收起绷紧的帆，而且还轮班掌舵。但是这也不奇怪，因为我的祖先本来就和这些海上的人是一个血统。","“And in this manner, through rough seas and great storms, came to Unalaska.There were two schooners there, but neither was the one I sought.So I passed on to the east, with the world growing ever larger, and in the Island of Unamok there was no word of the ship, nor in Kadiak, nor in Atognak.And so I came one day to a rocky land, where men dug great holes in the mountain.And there was a schooner, but not my schooner, and men loaded upon it the rocks which they dug.This thought childish, for all the world was made of rocks; but they gave me food and set me to work.When the schooner was deep in the water, the captain gave me money and told me to go; but I asked which way he went, and he pointed south.I made signs that I would go with him; and he laughed at first, but then, being short of men, took me to help work the ship.So I came to talk after their manner, and to heave on ropes, and to reef the stiff sails in sudden squalls, and to take my turn at the wheel.But it was not strange, for the blood of my fathers was the blood of the men of the sea."
"“我原本以为，只要我在他那一族人里，很容易就能找到他；一天，我们看到了陆地，我们的船经过海峡，驶入港口，我原来以为，这里的双桅船可能也就我的手指头那么多。但是顺着码头接连几英里都停着这样的船，像很多小鱼挤在一起似的；当我到那些船上打听那个头发像海豹鬃毛的家伙的时候，他们都笑了，用各种不同的语言来回答我。我这才知道，他们来自世界的各个角落。","“I had thought it an easy task to find him I sought, once I got among his own people; and when we raised the land one day, and passed between a gateway of the sea to a port, I looked for perhaps as many schooners as there were fingers to my hands.But the ships lay against the wharves for miles, packed like so many little fish; and when I went among them to ask for a man with the mane of a sea lion, they laughed, and answered me in the tongues of many peoples.And I found that they hailed from the uttermost parts of the earth."
"“于是我进入市区，看着每一个行人的脸。但是他们就像游到岸上的密密麻麻的鳕鱼，不计其数。喧闹声不断袭来，弄得我什么都听不见，那乱糟糟的场面弄得我晕头转向。于是，我继续往前走，走过了那些阳光下歌声飘荡的地方；走过了平原上堆满了丰收的庄稼的地方；还走过了很多大城市，在那里，男人过着女人般的日子，他们嘴里全是假话，因为只想着金子，他们的心都是黑的。但是这个时候，我的族人却在阿卡屯狩猎打鱼，快乐逍遥，以为这世界只是一个小天地。","“And I went into the city to look upon the face of every man.But they were like the cod when they run thick on the banks, and I could not count them.And the noise smote upon me till I could not hear, and my head was dizzy with much movement.So I went on and on, through the lands which sang in the warm sunshine; where the harvests lay rich on the plains; and where great cities were fat with men that lived like women, with false words in their mouths and their hearts black with the lust of gold.And all the while my people of Akatan hunted and fished, and were happy in the thought that the world was small."
"“可是，那次昂加捕鱼回家时看我的眼神总是跟着我，我知道，总有一天我会找到她的。以前，她经常在暮色中到静谧的小路上散步，有的时候还惹得我从那被晨露沾湿的茂密的田野里穿过去追她，她的眼里有默许的意思，只有昂加这样的女人才会有这样的眼神。","“But the look in the eyes of Unga coming home from the fishing was with me always, and I knew I would find her when the time was met.She walked down quiet lanes in the dusk of the evening, or led me chases across the thick fields wet with the morning dew, and there was a promise in her eyes such as only the woman Unga could give."
"“所以我一路游荡，走过了上千座城市。有些人很友好，还给我食物，有些人则嘲笑我，甚至还有人咒骂我；但是我咬紧牙关，仍然行走在陌生的路上，看着各种陌生的景象。有的时候，我，一个酋长，还是酋长的儿子，竟然给人家当苦工——给那些言语粗鲁、铁石心肠的人当苦工，他们从同胞的汗水和悲苦中捞取金子。然而，我还是打听不到任何消息，直到我像一个归巢的海豹似的再次回到海上。但是这次是在另一个港口，在另外一个位于北方的国家。在那里，我听说了一些关于那个黄头发的海上流浪汉的不太具体的传言，我了解到他是个猎捕海豹的，那时候他正在海上行驶。","“So I wandered through a thousand cities.Some were gentle and gave me food, and others laughed, and still others cursed; but I kept my tongue between my teeth, and went strange ways and saw strange sights.Sometimes, I, who was a chief and the son of a chief, toiled for men,—men rough of speech and hard as iron, who wrung gold from the sweat and sorrow of their fellow men.Yet no word did I get of my quest, till came back to the sea like a homing seal to the rookeries.But this was at another port, in another country which lay to the north.And there heard dim tales of the yellow-haired sea wanderer, and I learned that he was a hunter of seals, and that even then he was abroad on the ocean."
"“所以，我就和几个懒散的西瓦希人一起坐上一艘猎捕海豹的双桅船，顺着他那条没有任何痕迹的路线去了北方，当时那里恰是猎捕海豹的旺季。我们在海上呆了几个月，疲惫不堪，我们谈论了很多有关船队的事，还听说了不少有关那个家伙的野蛮行为；但是却一次也没有在海上碰见他。我们接着往北走，一直到了普里比洛夫群岛，我们在沙滩上杀死了成群的海豹，然后把还留有余温的海豹尸体搬到船上，直到船上的排水口淌出来的都是油和血，甲板上站不住人为止。然后便有一艘轮船来追我们，还向我们开炮。但是我们扬起帆，大海冲刷着甲板，将它们洗得干干净净，而我们也在大雾中迷了路。","“So I shipped on a seal schooner with the lazy Siwashes, and followed his trackless trail to the north where the hunt was then warm.And we were away weary months, and spoke many of the fleet, and heard much of the wild doings of him I sought; but never once did we raise him above the sea.We went north, even to the Pribyloffs, and killed the seals in herds on the beach, and brought their warm bodies aboard till our scuppers ran grease and blood and no man could stand upon the deck.Then were we chased by a ship of slow steam, which fired upon us with great guns.But we put on sail till the sea was over our decks and washed them clean, and lost ourselves in a fog."
"“听说，当时，就在我们被吓得心惊肉跳，迅速逃跑的时候，那个黄头发的海上流浪汉恰好来到了普里比洛夫群岛，在岛的左边有一家工厂，他一边叫手下的人扣住公司的员工，一边叫其他的人从工厂里搬出一万张生皮装到船上。我说过，这些事听别人讲的，不过我相信是真的；因为虽然在海上航行的时候没有见过他，但是北方的海上却传遍了他肆意妄为的行为，以至于在那里有属地的三个国家都派船来逮他。我还听到了一些关于昂加的消息，因为船长们都对她赞赏有加，她一直跟那个人在一起。听他们说，她已经学会了过他那种人的日子，还很开心。但是我比谁都了解——我明白她的心是向着阿卡屯那片黄色沙滩上她自己的族人的。","“It is said, at this time, while we fled with fear at our hearts, that the yellow-haired sea wanderer put into the Pribyloffs, right to the factory, and while the part of his men held the servants of the company, the rest loaded ten thousand green skins from the salt-houses.I say it is said, but I believe; for in the voyages made on the coast with never a meeting, the northern seas rang with his wildness and daring, till the three nations which have lands there sought him with their ships.And I heard of Unga, for the captains sang loud in her praise, and she was always with him.She had learned the ways of his people, they said, and was happy.But I knew better,—knew that her heart harked back to her own people by the yellow beach of Akatan."
"“就这样，很久以后，我又回到了那个在海峡附近的港口。刚到那里，我就听人说他已经跨过大洋，到俄罗斯海南面那一带暖和地方的东海岸捕海豹去了。而我，此时已经成了一个水手，和他那一类的人一起坐上船，跟在他后面去捕海豹。那片新的地带没有几艘船；但是整个春天，我们都守在海豹群的附近，把它们赶向北方。后来，母海豹们怀孕了，都游到了俄国的领海区域，我们的人就开始抱怨，感到害怕了。因为那里总是有大雾，坐小船的人每天都有几个消失不见的。他们不愿意干了，所以船长不得不沿着来时的路线返航。但是我知道那个黄头发的海上流浪汉是不会怕的，他会一直守在海豹群附近，甚至会追到俄罗斯群岛，那里可是很少有人去的。于是我就在漆黑的夜晚，趁着放哨的人在船头甲板上打瞌睡的工夫，乘着一只小艇，一个人朝着那个暖和的长岛划去。我一路往南划，遇见江户湾附近的人，他们可是既野蛮又无所畏惧的家伙。吉原的姑娘们都很娇小，皮肤光亮得像钢一样，长得很好看；但是我不能停下来，因为我知道昂加正在北方海豹栖息地附近的海上漂泊。","“So, after a long time, I went back to the port which is by a gateway of the sea, and there I learned that he had gone across the girth of the great ocean to hunt for the seal to the east of the warm land which runs south from the Russian Seas.And I, who was become a sailorman, shipped with men of his own race, and went after him in the hunt of the seal.And there were few ships off that new land; but we hung on the flank of the seal pack and harried it north through all the spring of the year.And when the cows were heavy with pup and crossed the Russian line, our men grumbled and were afraid.For there was much fog, and every day men were lost in the boats.They would not work, so the captain turned the ship back toward the way it came.But I knew the yellow-haired sea wanderer was unafraid, and would hang by the pack, even to the Russian Isles, where few men go.So I took a boat, in the black of night, when the lookout dozed on the fok’slehead, and went alone to the warm, long land.And I journeyed south to meet the men by Yeddo Bay, who are wild and unafraid.And the Yoshiwara girls were small, and bright like steel, and good to look upon; but I could not stop, for I knew that Unga rolled on the tossing floor by the rookeries of the north."
"“江户湾的人来自世界上的各个角落，他们不信神，也没有家，他们的船上都挂着日本国旗。我跟随着他们一起去了富饶的科珀岛，在那里我们的船舱堆满了皮子。一直到我们打算离开，在那片平静的海面上，我们斗没有遇见过一个人。然后，有一天，一股大风吹开了浓浓的雾气，有一艘双桅帆船急匆匆地朝我们驶来，后面紧紧跟着一艘烟囱里冒着浓烟的俄国军舰。我们借着风势飞速逃跑，而那艘双桅帆船却紧紧逼近，我们每前行两英尺，它就追上来三英尺。在船尾站着的那个人就是那个头发像海狮鬃毛的家伙，他正按住栏杆，压着帆，信心满满地笑着。昂加也在那里——我一下子就认出她了——但是大炮从海面上飞过来的时候，他就把她送到舱里去了。我刚才讲过，我们的船行驶两英尺，他们就追上来三英尺，直到它被浪一颠，我们才看见那绿色的舵——我们已经在俄国人炮弹的射程里了，我一边掌好舵轮，一边诅咒。因为我们都知道，他是故意要跑到我们前头，这样，他就能趁我们被逮住时跑掉。他们把我们的桅杆给炸飞了，我们就像受了伤的海鸥似的被扯进风里；但是他却一直往前驶去，驶出了水平线——他和昂加。","“The men by Yeddo Bay had met from the ends of the earth, and had neither gods nor homes, sailing under the flag of the Japanese.And with them I went to the rich beaches of Copper Island, where our salt-piles became high with skins.And in that silent sea we saw no man till we were ready to come away.Then, one day, the fog lifted on the edge of a heavy wind, and there jammed down upon us a schooner, with close in her wake the cloudy funnels of a Russian man-of-war.We fled away on the beam of the wind, with the schooner jamming still closer and plunging ahead three feet to our two.And upon her poop was the man with the mane of the sea lion, pressing the rails under with the canvas and laughing in his strength of life.And Unga was there,—I knew her on the moment,—but he sent her below when the cannons began to talk across the sea.As I say, with three feet to our two, till we saw the rudder lift green at every jump,—and I swinging on to the wheel and cursing, with my back to the Russian shot.For we knew he had it in mind to run before us, that he might get away while we were caught.And they knocked our masts out of us till we dragged into the wind like a wounded gull; but he went on over the edge of the sky-line,—he and Unga."
"“我们能怎么办呢？刚剥下的海豹皮就是证据。所以，他们把我们带到一个俄国港口，然后又带到一个人迹罕至的地方，在那里他们逼着我们在矿里挖盐。有的人死了，还有——还有一些人保住了命。”","“What could we?The fresh hides spoke for themselves.So they took us to a Russian port, and after that to a lone country, where they set us to work in the mines to dig salt.And some died, and—and some did not die.”"
"纳斯撩开他肩上的毯子，露出粗糙变形的皮肤，上面有明显的被鞭子抽打过的一道道伤痕。普林斯赶紧给他盖好，因为那情景让人看着真不是滋味。","Naass swept the blanket from his shoulders, disclosing the gnarled and twisted flesh, marked with the unmistakable striations of the knout.Prince hastily covered him, for it was not nice to look upon."
"“我们在那里过得很煎熬；有的时候，也有人往南边逃跑，但是每次都被抓回来。所以，等到我们这些来自江户湾的人在夜晚行动起来，抢了警卫的枪以后，我们就往北方逃去。那一带地域辽阔，有湿乎乎的平原，还有大片的树林。严寒的时节到来了，地上有很厚的雪，没有人认得路。我们在没有边际的树林里走了好几个月，疲惫不堪——那样的日子，我如今已经不记得了，因为那里几乎没有什么吃的东西，我们经常是躺着等死。不过，最终我们还是来到了寒冷的海边，但是只剩下三个人看到了大海。一个是来自江户的船长，这一带陆地的地形都在他脑子里，他还知道人们可以从冰面上的某个地方由一个大陆到另一个大陆去。他带着我们——我不知道路有这么长——最后只剩下我们两个人。等我们到了那个从冰上过海的地方，我们碰见五个陌生人，他们是当地人，他们有狗和皮子，而我们一贫如洗。我们在雪里跟他们打了起来，最后他们被干掉了，船长也死了，狗和皮子就都是我的了。然后，我就走上了那片冰面，冰面裂开了，我曾经一度在海上漂流，直到西面来的一阵大风把我吹到了岸上。那以后，我又走过了戈洛文湾、帕斯提里克，以及那个神父那里。然后便是往南，再往南，到了我第一次去过的那个暖洋洋的、满是阳光的地方。","“We were there a weary time; and sometimes men got away to the south, but they always came back.So, when we who hailed from Yeddo Bay rose in the night and took the guns from the guards, we went to the north.And the land was very large, with plains, soggy with water, and great forests.And the cold came, with much snow on the ground, and no man knew the way.Weary months we journeyed through the endless forest,—I do not remember, now, for there was little food and often we lay down to die.But at last we came to the cold sea, and but three were left to look upon it.One had shipped from Yeddo as captain, and he knew in his head the lay of the great lands, and of the place where men may cross from one to the other on the ice.And he led us,—I do not know, it was so long,—till there were but two.When we came to that place we found five of the strange people which live in that country, and they had dogs and skins, and we were very poor.We fought in the snow till they died, and the captain died, and the dogs and skins were mine.Then I crossed on the ice, which was broken, and once drifted till a gale from the west put me upon the shore.And after that, Golovin Bay, Pastilik, and the priest.Then south, south, to the warm sunlands where first I wandered."
"“但是，从海里已经捞不到多少东西了，出去捕海豹利小险大。船队也很散，船长和水手都不知道我要找的那个人的消息。所以我就离开了永不宁静的大海，在树林、房子和大山永远静止不动的陆地上穿梭。我走了很远，也学会了很多，甚至还学会了看书写字。我觉得这样也不错，因为我想，昂加肯定也学会了这些事情，也许哪一天，到那天——我们——不用说你们也懂的，到了那一天。","“But the sea was no longer fruitful, and those who went upon it after the seal went to little profit and great risk.The fleets scattered, and the captains and the men had no word of those I sought.So I turned away from the ocean which never rests, and went among the lands, where the trees, the houses, and the mountains sit always in one place and do not move.I journeyed far, and came to learn many things, even to the way of reading and writing from books.It was well I should do this, for it came upon me that Unga must know these things, and that some day, when the time was met—we—you understand, when the time was met."
"“所以我到处漂泊，像那些只能迎风起航却没有舵的小渔船一样。但是我的眼睛和耳朵时刻都在注意看，留心听。我经常和那些走过很多地方的人打交道，因为我知道他们只要见过我要找的那两个人，就肯定不会忘记。最后，我遇见一个刚从大山里出来的人，他有几块矿石，里面嵌着很多跟豆子差不多大的金沙。他听说过他们，并且见过他们，还认识他们。他说，他们很有钱，就住在他们从地里挖金子的那个地方。","“So I drifted, like those little fish which raise a sail to the wind, but cannot steer.But my eyes and my ears were open always, and went among men who traveled much, for I knew they had but to see those sought, to remember.At last there came a man, fresh from the mountains, with pieces of rock in which the free gold stood to the size of peas, and he had heard, he had met, he knew them.They were rich, he said, and lived in the place where they drew the gold from the ground."
"“那是个人迹罕至的地方，还非常远；但是我总算到了那个藏在群山间的宿营地，那里的人没日没夜地干活，根本看不到太阳。我从那些人的谈话中听出来，时机还不成熟。他已经离开了——他们已经离开了——去英国了，听说，他们是想找几个有钱人来开公司。我看见了他们住的房子，就像古代国家里的宫殿一样。夜晚，我从窗子爬了进去，想看看他是怎么对她的。我从一个房间走进另一个房间，我觉得国王和王后过的就是这样的日子，美妙极了。他们都说他对她像对王后一样，很多人都纳闷她是什么民族的人；因为她的血管里流着不一样的血，她跟阿卡屯的女人不一样，没有人知道她是什么人。对，她是位王后；但是我是酋长，还是酋长的儿子，我为她付出了难以估价的皮子、船和珠子。","“It was in a wild country, and very far away; but in time came to the camp, hidden between the mountains, where men worked night and day, out of the sight of the sun.Yet the time was not come. Listened to the talk of the people.He had gone away,—they had gone away,—to England, it was said, in the matter of bringing men with much money together to form companies.I saw the house they had lived in; more like a palace, such as one sees in the old countries.In the nighttime I crept in through a window that I might see in what manner he treated her.I went from room to room, and in such way thought kings and queens must live, it was all so very good.And they all said he treated her like a queen, and many marveled as to what breed of woman she was; for there was other blood in her veins, and she was different from the women of Akatan, and no one knew her for what she was.Ay, she was a queen; but I was a chief, and the son of a chief, and had paid for her an untold price of skin and boat and bead."
"“但是，何必要说这么多呢？我是一个水手，我知道船在海上航行的路线。我跟着他们去了英国，接着又去了别的国家。有的时候，我从人们嘴里听到关于他们的一些情况，有的时候，我还会从报纸上读到关于他们的消息；然而我没有一次能见到他们，因为他们有很多钱，所以走得很快，而我只是一个穷人。后来，他们也遇上麻烦了，有一天，他们的财产像一缕轻烟一样没了踪影。那个时候，报纸上全刊登着这件事情；但是之后就没有消息了，我知道他们肯定又返回那个从土地里可以挖出更多金子的地方了。“如今，他们既然没钱了，也就被世人抛弃了；我从一个宿营地游荡到另一个宿营地，甚至还到了北方的库特奈地区，并在那里打听到一点儿过时的消息。他们去过那里，但是已经离开了，有人说往这边走了，有人说往那边走了，还有人说他们去了育空河。就这样，我先往这边走，再往那边走，总是从一个地方到另一个地方，一直走到我对这个广阔无边的世界感到厌烦了似的。但是，我在库特奈地区曾经跟一个西北地区的土人一块赶路，那条路很长也很不好走，他忍受不了饥饿的痛苦，觉得还是死了最好。他曾顺着一条没人知道的路，翻过大山，到了育空河一带。那时，他知道自己大限将至，就给了我一张地图，还告诉了我一个秘密的地方，他对天发誓，说那里有很多金子。","“But why so many words?I was a sailorman, and knew the way of the ships on the seas.I followed to England, and then to other countries.Sometimes I heard of them by word of mouth, sometimes I read of them in the papers; yet never once could I come by them, for they had much money, and traveled fast, while I was a poor man.Then came trouble upon them, and their wealth slipped away, one day, like a curl of smoke.The papers were full of it at the time; but after that nothing was said, and I knew they had gone back where more gold could be got from the ground.“They had dropped out of the world, being now poor; and so wandered from camp to camp, even north to the Kootenay Country, where picked up the cold scent.They had come and gone, some said this way, and some that, and still others that they had gone to the Country of the Yukon.And I went this way, and I went that, ever journeying from place to place, till it seemed I must grow weary of the world which was so large.But in the Kootenay I traveled a bad trail, and a long trail, with a ‘breed’ of the Northwest, who saw fit to die when the famine pinched.He had been to the Yukon by an unknown way over the mountains, and when he knew his time was near gave me the map and the secret of a place where he swore by his gods there was much gold."
"“那以后，所有的人都向北方涌去。我是个穷光蛋，只好把自己卖给其他人赶狗。剩下的你们就知道了。我在道森遇上了他们两个。她没认出我来，因为那时我还年轻，而她的日子又过得那么富有，所以她也没有闲暇记着我这个为她付出那么多代价的人。","“After that all the world began to flock into the north.I was a poor man; I sold myself to be a driver of dogs.The rest you know. I met him and her in Dawson.She did not know me, for I was only a stripling, and her life had been large, so she had no time to remember the one who had paid for her an untold price."
"“可不是吗？你帮我提前逃脱了苦役。我想返回去，按照我自己的方式去办事；因为我已经等了很久，如今既然他已经在我手里了，我就不必急在一时了。我说过的，这件事我想用自己的方法去办；因为我回想了自己这一辈子，包括所有我看到的和经历过的事情，还想起了在俄罗斯海边漫无边际的树林里所经受的饥寒交迫。你们都知道，我领着他——他和昂加——往东走，很多人去那里，但是回来的并不多。我把他们带到受人诅咒的地方，那里遍地白骨和带不走的黄金。","“So?You bought me from my term of service.I went back to bring things about in my own way; for I had waited long, and now that had my hand upon him was in no hurry.As I say, I had it in mind to do my own way; for I read back in my life, through all I had seen and suffered, and remembered the cold and hunger of the endless forest by the Russian Seas.As you know, I led him into the east,—him and Unga,—into the east where many have gone and few returned.I led them to the spot where the bones and the curses of men lie with the gold which they may not have."
"“路很长，路上的雪都没人踩过。我们有很多狗，它们吃得也多；我们的雪橇不能把开春之前所需要的东西都带上。我们必须在河水融化之前返回。所以，我们就沿途藏了一些食物，这样雪橇的负担就轻一些，而回来的时候我们又不会被饿死。有三个人在麦克奎森住着，我们在他们附近搭建了一个藏食物的棚子，到了马育，我们又搭了一个，那个地方有十二个佩利人在狩猎宿营，他们是穿过南边的分水岭到那里的。在那之后，我们再往东边走，就看不到人了；只有安睡的河流、纹丝不动的树林和北方万籁俱寂的雪原。我说过，那条路很长，雪也没有人踩过。有的时候，我们劳累了一整天，也不过行进八到十英里路，到了晚上，我们睡得像死人一样沉。他们连做梦都不会想到我就是纳斯，阿卡屯的酋长，想要复仇的人。","“The way was long and the trail unpacked.Our dogs were many and ate much; nor could our sleds carry till the break of spring.We must come back before the river ran free.So here and there we cached grub, that our sleds might be lightened and there be no chance of famine on the back trip.At the McQuestion there were three men, and near them we built a cache, as also did we at the Mayo, where was a hunting-camp of a dozen Pellys which had crossed the divide from the south.After that, as we went on into the east, we saw no men; only the sleeping river, the moveless forest, and the White Silence of the North.As say, the way was long and the trail unpacked.Sometimes, in a day’s toil, we made no more than eight miles, or ten, and at night we slept like dead men.And never once did they dream that I was Naass, head man of Akatan, the righter of wrongs."
"“这个时候，我们搭的棚子比过去小了，到了晚上，我便轻而易举地沿着来时的路回去，把食物转移到别的地方，让人以为是黑獾偷走了食物。另外，还有那种容易掉进水里的地方，因为水流湍急，冰只结在表面，下面的那层很容易受河水冲刷。在这样一个地方，我赶的雪橇连狗一起掉下去了；这对于他和昂加来说是很不幸的事，但是之后再没有发生过这样的事。那架雪橇上有很多食物，狗也是最壮实的。但是因为身体强壮，他反而大笑起来，给剩下的狗很少的食物，后来我们就割断缰绳，把它们一个一个喂给它们的同伴。他说，这样的话，我们回去的时候负担就少了，我们可以沿途从这个棚子吃到那个棚子，就不需要狗跟雪橇了；这倒不假，因为我们的食物确实不多了，等到那个晚上，我们到了那个布满黄金和白骨、受人诅咒的地方，剩下的最后一条狗也死在挽具里了。","“We now made smaller caches, and in the nighttime it was a small matter to go back on the trail we had broken, and change them in such way that one might deem the wolverines the thieves.Again, there be places where there is a fall to the river, and the water is unruly, and the ice makes above and is eaten away beneath.In such a spot the sled I drove broke through, and the dogs; and to him and Unga it was ill luck, but no more.And there was much grub on that sled, and the dogs the strongest.But he laughed, for he was strong of life, and gave the dogs that were left little grub till we cut them from the harnesses, one by one, and fed them to their mates.We would go home light, he said, traveling and eating from cache to cache, with neither dogs nor sleds; which was true, for our grub was very short, and the last dog died in the traces the night we came to the gold and the bones and the curses of men."
"“要达到那个地方——地图上标得很好——在群山中间，我们得在一个冰封的分水岭的峭壁上凿出一些台阶。我们期望分水岭后面有一个山谷，但是没有山谷；取而代之的是皑皑白雪，像丰收的大平原一样伸展开来，我们的周围都是傲然耸立的山峰，它们纷纷把白色的峰尖挤进群星之中。在那片原本应当是山谷的奇怪的大平原中间，地面和积雪都往下沉，似乎一直沉到了地球的心脏里。假如我们没有当过水手的话，见到这样的情景，我们肯定会头晕目眩；但是，我们依然站在这让人眩晕的山边，想找一条到下边去的路。而且其中有一侧，并且只有这一侧的峭壁是像刮起暴风时的甲板一样渐渐倾斜的。我不知道为什么会是那样，但是它就是那样。他说：‘这是地狱的入口，我们到下面去吧。’然后我们便下去了。","“To reach that place,—and the map spoke true,—in the heart of the great mountains, we cut ice steps against the wall of a divide.One looked for a valley beyond, but there was no valley; the snow spread away, level as the great harvest plains, and here and there about us mighty mountains shoved their white heads among the stars.And midway on that strange plain which should have been a valley, the earth and the snow fell away, straight down toward the heart of the world.Had we not been sailormen our heads would have swung round with the sight; but we stood on the dizzy edge that we might see a way to get down.And on one side, and one side only, the wall had fallen away till it was like the slope of the decks in a topsail breeze.I do not know why this thing should be so, but it was so.‘It is the mouth of hell,’ he said; ‘let us go down.’And we went down."
"“山谷底部有一个小木屋，可能是过去有人从上面把木头丢下去，然后建造的。那是一栋非常老的木屋；因为不同时期到那里的人都孤孤单单地死在那个屋子里了，我们从地上的一些桦树皮上看见了他们临死前留下的文字和诅咒。有一个是得坏血病死的；还有一个是因为他的同伴抢走了他仅剩的一点儿食物和火药以后逃走了；第三个是被一只脸上有白斑的灰熊给弄死的；第四个想捕猎来充饥，但还是饿死了——还有其他的，情况都差不多。他们都不愿意离开那些金子，最终只能死在金子旁边了，只是各有各的死法。他们挖来的那些没用的金子铺在木屋的地板上，到处金光闪闪的，让人感觉就像在梦中一样。","“And on the bottom there was a cabin, built by some man, of logs which he had cast down from above.It was a very old cabin; for men had died there alone at different times, and on pieces of birch bark which were there we read their last words and their curses.One had died of scurvy; another’s partner had robbed him of his last grub and powder and stolen away; a third had been mauled by a bald-face grizzly; a fourth had hunted for game and starved,—and so it went, and they had been loath to leave the gold, and had died by the side of it in one way or another.And the worthless gold they had gathered yellowed the floor of the cabin like in a dream."
"“但是，被我带到这么远的那个人，他内心很平静，脑子也很清醒。他说：‘我们没有吃的了，我们只能看看这里的金子，搞清楚它从什么地方来的，究竟有多少。之后我们就必须赶紧离开，以免它跳进我们的眼睛，偷走了我们的控制力。这样的话，最终我们还能回来，多带点吃的，那么所有的金子就都属于我们了。’于是，我们观察了一下那个大矿脉，它就像人的静脉一样贯穿着矿壁；我们量了一下，又从上往下勾勒出它的轮廓，然后打下一个个木桩子，并且在树上刻下了字，作为归我们所有的标志。那个时候，因为没有食物，我们的膝盖都在打颤，肚子里非常难受，心脏也扑通扑通地就快跳到嗓子眼了，所以，我们最终还是爬上了那个陡峭的岩壁上，开始往回走了。","“But his soul was steady, and his head clear, this man I had led thus far.‘We have nothing to eat,’ he said, ‘and we will only look upon this gold, and see whence it comes and how much there be.Then we will go away quick, before it gets into our eyes and steals away our judgment.And in this way we may return in the end, with more grub, and possess it all.’ So we looked upon the great vein, which cut the wall of the pit as a true vein should; and we measured it, and traced it from above and below, and drove the stakes of the claims and blazed the trees in token of our rights.Then, our knees shaking with lack of food, and a sickness in our bellies, and our hearts chugging close to our mouths, we climbed the mighty wall for the last time and turned our faces to the back trip."
"“在最后一段路上，我们两个人搀着昂加走，我们总是摔倒，不过最终我们还是到了那个藏食物的棚子。看，根本没有食物。这事做得天衣无缝，他以为是被黑獾偷去了，他不断地咒骂那些黑獾跟他的神。但是昂加什么都不怕，她笑着把手放在他手里，而我不得不背过身子，努力控制自己的情绪。她说：‘我们就在火跟前歇息到早上吧，我们可以先把鹿皮鞋吃了，好增加点儿力气。’于是，我们就把鹿皮鞋的鞋筒割成一条一条的，煮了半夜，这样我们才能嚼烂了吞进肚子里。早上我们谈了谈我们的处境。到下一个棚子还有五天的行程；我们是走不到那里的。我们必须得找到野兽才行。","“The last stretch we dragged Unga between us, and we fell often, but in the end we made the cache.And lo, there was no grub.It was well done, for he thought it the wolverines, and damned them and his gods in the one breath.But Unga was brave, and smiled, and put her hand in his, till I turned away that I might hold myself.‘We will rest by the fire,’ she said, ‘till morning, and we will gather strength from our moccasins.’So we cut the tops of our moccasins in strips, and boiled them half of the night, that we might chew them and swallow them.And in the morning we talked of our chance.The next cache was five days’ journey; we could not make it.We must find game."
"‘我们去捕猎吧。’他说。","‘We will go forth and hunt,’ he said."
"我说：‘好，我们捕猎去。’","‘Yes,’ said I, ‘we will go forth and hunt.’"
"“他命令昂加留在火堆旁，保存力气。然后我们就动身了，他去找驼鹿，我去找我转移了的食物棚。但是我只吃了一点儿，这样他们就看不出我的体力不弱。晚上，在返回露营地的路上，他摔倒了好多回。我也假装很虚弱，总是被雪鞋绊倒，好像每走一步都是最后一步似的。后来我们把鹿皮鞋吃了才有了点儿力气。","“And he ruled that Unga stay by the fire and save her strength.And we went forth, he in quest of the moose, and I to the cache I had changed.But I ate little, so they might not see in me much strength.And in the night he fell many times as he drew into camp.And I too made to suffer great weakness, stumbling over my snowshoes as though each step might be my last.And we gathered strength from our moccasins."
"“他是个很棒的人。他的精神一直支撑着他的身体到最后的时刻；除了为昂加之外，他始终没有放声哭过。第二天，我跟着他去捕猎，怕最后见不着他了。他经常躺下歇息。那天晚上，他快不行了；但是到了早上，他无力地咒骂了几句，又接着往前走。他好像一个喝多了酒的人，有很多回我都感觉他要不行了；但是他很坚强，有巨人一样的灵魂支撑着他的身体熬过那疲惫不堪的一天。他猎到了两只松鸡，但是他不愿意吃。他根本用不着火；它们能挽救他的性命；但是他想着昂加，所以他转身往我们的露营地去了。他走不动了，但是他用手和膝盖撑在雪里往前爬。我走到他面前，在他眼睛里看到了死亡的气息。尽管到了那个时候，只要吃了松鸡，还来得及。他扔掉了来复枪，像狗一样，用嘴叼着那两只松鸡。我在他身旁走着，身体挺得直直的。然后他歇息的时候看了看我，奇怪我为什么这么强壮。我能看出来，尽管他已经说不出话了；他嘴唇动了动，但没有发出声音。我说过，他是个很棒的人，我的心也有点儿软了；但是回想起过去的事情，我记起了自己在俄罗斯海边漫无边际的树林里经受了怎样的饥寒交迫。何况，昂加本来是我的，我为她付了皮子、船和珠子的高昂的价格。","“He was a great man.His soul lifted his body to the last; nor did he cry aloud, save for the sake of Unga.On the second day followed him, that I might not miss the end.And he lay down to rest often.That night he was near gone; but in the morning he swore weakly and went forth again.He was like a drunken man, and I looked many times for him to give up; but his was the strength of the strong, and his soul the soul of a giant, for he lifted his body through all the weary day.And he shot two ptarmigan, but would not eat them.He needed no fire; they meant life; but his thought was for Unga, and he turned toward camp.He no longer walked, but crawled on hand and knee through the snow.I came to him, and read death in his eyes.Even then it was not too late to eat of the ptarmigan.He cast away his rifle, and carried the birds in his mouth like a dog.I walked by his side, upright.And he looked at me during the moments he rested, and wondered that I was so strong.I could see it, though he no longer spoke; and when his lips moved, they moved without sound.As I say, he was a great man, and my heart spoke for softness; but I read back in my life, and remembered the cold and hunger of the endless forest by the Russian Seas.Besides, Unga was mine, and I had paid for her an untold price of skin and boat and bead."
"“就这样，我们穿过了白雪皑皑的树林，周围一片寂静，好像海上潮湿的雾一样重重地压在我们身上。过去的幻影弥漫在空中，笼罩在我们周围；我看到了阿卡屯黄色的沙滩，捕完鱼冲回家的皮舟，还有树林边上的房子。还有那两个自封为酋长的人，这两个立下各种规矩的人，一个是我的祖先，一个是嫁给我的昂加的祖先。不错，雅希－奴希也走在我旁边，他的头发上粘着潮湿的沙子，还有那根他摔倒时被折断的长矛依然在他手里。我知道是时候了，我看见了昂加眼里默然相许的目光。","“And in this manner we came through the white forest, with the silence heavy upon us like a damp sea mist.And the ghosts of the past were in the air and all about us; and I saw the yellow beach of Akatan, and the kayaks racing home from the fishing, and the houses on the rim of the forest.And the men who had made themselves chiefs were there, the lawgivers whose blood I bore, and whose blood I had wedded in Unga.Ay, and Yash-Noosh walked with me, the wet sand in his hair, and his war spear, broken as he fell upon it, still in his hand.And I knew the time was met, and saw in the eyes of Unga the promise."
"“我说过，我们就这样穿过树林，直到营火的烟味钻进我们的鼻子。于是我弯下腰，从他嘴里抢过了那两只松鸡。他侧过身子，休息了一会儿，他的眼中露出惊讶的神色，他身下的那只手慢慢往他屁股上的那把刀摸过去。但是我把他的刀拿走了，在他眼前笑了起来。直到那个时候，他还是不知道。于是，我就做出从黑瓶子里喝酒的样子，假装在雪地上摞起一堆高高的货物，把那天晚上我结婚时的情景重演了一遍。我什么都没说，但是他懂了。然而他并不害怕。他的嘴角露出一丝讥笑，透露着冷冷的愤怒，知道了这些，他好像又有了些力气。路并不远，但是雪很厚，他慢慢地拖着自己的身子。有一回，他躺了很长时间，我把他翻过来，看着他的眼睛。他有时候往前面看，有时候目光呆滞。等我松开他以后，他又挣扎着往前爬。就这样，我们到了火堆旁边。昂加马上走到他身边。他的嘴唇动了几下，没有声音；接着他指了指我，希望昂加能明白。然后他便躺在雪里，静静地躺了很长时间。如今他仍然在那里躺着。","“As I say, we came thus through the forest, till the smell of the camp smoke was in our nostrils.And I bent above him, and tore the ptarmigan from his teeth.He turned on his side and rested, the wonder mounting in his eyes, and the hand which was under slipping slow toward the knife at his hip.But I took it from him, smiling close in his face.Even then he did not understand.So I made to drink from black bottles, and to build high upon the snow a pile of goods, and to live again the things which happened on the night of my marriage.I spoke no word, but he understood.Yet was he unafraid.There was a sneer to his lips, and cold anger, and he gathered new strength with the knowledge.It was not far, but the snow was deep, and he dragged himself very slow.Once, he lay so long, I turned him over and gazed into his eyes.And sometimes he looked forth, and sometimes death.And when I loosed him he struggled on again.In this way we came to the fire.Unga was at his side on the instant.His lips moved, without sound; then he pointed at me, that Unga might understand.And after that he lay in the snow, very still, for a long while.Even now is he there in the snow."
"“我一直在做松鸡，没有说话。然后我跟她说话，说的是她很多年没有听过的家乡话。她直起身，就这样，由于惊讶，眼睛睁得很大，她问我是什么人，从什么地方学来的这种话。","“I said no word till I had cooked the ptarmigan.Then I spoke to her, in her own tongue, which she had not heard in many years.She straightened herself, so, and her eyes were wonder-wide, and she asked who I was, and where I had learned that speech."
"“我说：‘我是纳斯。’","“‘I am Naass,’ I said."
"‘你？’她说，‘是你？’她爬到我面前好看个清楚。","‘You?’ she said.‘You?’ And she crept close that she might look upon me."
"‘是的，’我回答，‘我是纳斯，阿卡屯的酋长，我们整个家族最后一条血脉，就像你一样，你也是你们家族最后一条血脉。’","‘Yes,’ I answered; ‘I am Naass, head man of Akatan, the last of the blood, as you are the last of the blood.’"
"“她笑了。我用我见过的和做过的一切发誓，我再也不要听到那样的笑声。它让我心寒，在那万籁俱寂的雪野里，只有我一个人和死神，还有那个大笑的女人坐在那里。","“And she laughed.By all the things I have seen and the deeds I have done, may I never hear such a laugh again.It put the chill to my soul, sitting there in the White Silence, alone with death and this woman who laughed."
"‘过来！’我说，因为我觉得她已经疯了，‘吃点儿东西，我们就走吧。从这里到阿卡屯还有很远的路呢。’","‘Come!’ I said, for I thought she wandered.‘Eat of the food and let us be gone.It is a far fetch from here to Akatan.’"
"“但是她把脸藏进他的黄头发里，一直笑，直笑到仿佛我们耳边的天就要掉下来了似的。我原本以为她见到我会欣喜若狂，会马上记起过去的事情；但是她用这样的方式，让我感觉很诧异。‘过来！’我使劲抓住她的手，大声喊道，‘路又远又黑。我们快点儿吧！”","“But she shoved her face in his yellow mane, and laughed till it seemed the heavens must fall about our ears.I had thought she would be overjoyed at the sight of me, and eager to go back to the memory of old times; but this seemed a strange form to take.‘Come!’ I cried, taking her strong by the hand.‘The way is long and dark.Let us hurry!’"
"‘去什么地方？’她不再奇怪地笑了，坐起来问我。","‘Where?’ she asked, sitting up, and ceasing from her strange mirth."
"‘去阿卡屯。’我答道，盼望着她一听见我的话，脸上会露出快乐的神情。但是她跟他一样，嘴角露出一丝讥笑，流露出冷冷的愤怒。","‘To Akatan,’ I answered, intent on the light to grow on her face at the thought.But it became like his, with a sneer to the lips, and cold anger."
"‘好啊，’她说，‘我们走吧，手牵着手，我和你，一起到阿卡屯去。我们去住那肮脏的茅屋，吃鱼和油，再生个孩子——让我们一辈子都为之骄傲的孩子。我们会忘记这个世界，会幸福，非常幸福。真是太棒了，棒极了。来吧！我们赶紧走。我们一起回阿卡屯去。’","‘Yes,’ she said; ‘we will go, hand in hand, to Akatan, you and I.And we will live in the dirty huts, and eat of the fish and oil, and bring forth a spawn,—a spawn to be proud of all the days of our life.We will forget the world and be happy, very happy.It is good, most good.Come!Let us hurry.Let us go back to Akatan.’"
"“她一边用手抚弄着他的黄头发，一边不怀好意地笑着。她的眼里没有默然相许的意思。","“And she ran her hand through his yellow hair, and smiled in a way which was not good.And there was no promise in her eyes."
"“我坐在那里一声不吭，弄不明白这个女人为什么这么奇怪。我记起了那天晚上他把她从我那里拽走的时候，她尖叫着撕扯着他的头发——如今，她却抚弄着它，不舍得放下。后来我还记起了我付出的代价和常年的等待；我牢牢抓住她，像他过去那样把她拽走。她也像那天晚上一样，倒退着，像一只母猫被人从小猫身边拽走那样挣扎着。等到我们到了火堆的另一面，和那个男人分开以后，我才松开了她，她坐下来听我说话。我给她讲了我所经历过的一切，我讲了我在陌生的海上和陌生的土地上所经历的事情；我讲了我怎样找得疲惫不堪，好多年忍饥挨饿，还有最初我的承诺。哎，我全跟她讲了，甚至包括那天我和那个男人所经历的一切，还有前些天的事情。我说话的时候，看到她眼中渐渐流露出蓦然相许的神色，像破晓时分的天空，又饱满，又丰富。我看见了她眼里流露出的同情、女性的柔情、爱意，和昂加的心和灵魂。于是，我又成了一个小伙子，因为这种神情就是当初昂加跑上沙滩，一边笑，一边跑进她母亲房子里去时露出的那种神情。严厉和不安不见了，饥饿和疲倦的等待也结束了。是时候了。我感觉到了她内心的呼唤，似乎是让我把头枕在她胸口，忘记所有的事情。她向我张开双臂，我朝她奔了过去。然后，突然之间，她的眼里迸发出了仇恨的火焰，她的手已经在我的腰部了。一刀、两刀，她捅了我两刀。","“I sat silent, and marveled at the strangeness of woman. I went back to the night when he dragged her from me, and she screamed and tore at his hair,—at his hair which now she played with and would not leave.Then I remembered the price and the long years of waiting; and gripped her close, and dragged her away as he had done.And she held back, even as on that night, and fought like a she-cat for its whelp.And when the fire was between us and the man, I loosed her, and she sat and listened.And I told her of all that lay between, of all that had happened me on strange seas, of all that I had done in strange lands; of my weary quest, and the hungry years, and the promise which had been mine from the first.Ay, I told all, even to what had passed that day between the man and me, and in the days yet young.And as spoke I saw the promise grow in her eyes, full and large like the break of dawn.And I read pity there, the tenderness of woman, the love, the heart and the soul of Unga.And I was a stripling again, for the look was the look of Unga as she ran up the beach, laughing, to the home of her mother.The stern unrest was gone, and the hunger, and the weary waiting.The time was met.I felt the call of her breast, and it seemed there I must pillow my head and forget.She opened her arms to me, and I came against her.Then, sudden, the hate flamed in her eye, her hand was at my hip.And once, twice, she passed the knife."
"‘狗！’她冷笑着把我推到雪里。‘猪！’然后她便大笑起来，直到笑声打破了寂静的夜，她又回到她的死人身边。","‘Dog!’ she sneered, as she flung me into the snow.‘Swine!’ And then she laughed till the silence cracked, and went back to her dead."
"我说过，她捅了我一刀，然后捅了第两刀；但是她饿得没了力气，根本杀不了我。然而，我还想呆在那里，合上眼睛，和那两个人一起长眠。他们的生活和我的生活交织在一起，把我引上了很多未知的路。但是我身上还有一笔债，让我无法安息。","As I say, once she passed the knife, and twice; but she was weak with hunger, and it was not meant that I should die.Yet was minded to stay in that place, and to close my eyes in the last long sleep with those whose lives had crossed with mine and led my feet on unknown trails.But there lay a debt upon me which would not let me rest."
"“路很长，天冷得刺骨，只有一点儿食物。佩利人没找到驼鹿，抢光了我的棚子。那三个白人也一样；但是经过他们的木屋时，我看见他们骨瘦如柴，已经饿死在那里了。后来的事我就不记得了，直到我来到这里，发现了食物和火——很多火。”","“And the way was long, the cold bitter, and there was little grub.The Pellys had found no moose, and had robbed my cache.And so had the three white men; but they lay thin and dead in their cabin as passed.After that I do not remember, till I came here, and found food and fire,—much fire.”"
"他讲完以后，羡慕不已地将身子靠近火炉。有很长一段时间，好像油灯的影子也在墙上演着一幕幕悲剧。","As he finished, he crouched closely, even jealously, over the stove.For a long while the slush-lamp shadows played tragedies upon the wall."
"“但是昂加！”普林斯叫道，那一幕情景还深深印在他脑子里。","“But Unga!” cried Prince, the vision still strong upon him."
"“昂加？她不愿意吃松鸡。她躺在那里，双手搂着他的脖子，脸深深埋在他的黄头发里。我把火挪近了一点儿，好让她不受冻；但是她爬到了另一边。我又在那一边生了火；但是也没什么用，因为她怎么都不愿意吃东西。就这样，他们仍然躺在雪里。”","“Unga?She would not eat of the ptarmigan.She lay with her arms about his neck, her face deep in his yellow hair.I drew the fire close, that she might not feel the frost; but she crept to the other side.And I built a fire there; yet it was little good, for she would not eat.And in this manner they still lie up there in the snow.”"
"“那你有什么打算呢？”马尔穆特·基德问。","“And you?” asked Malemute Kid."
"“我不知道；阿卡屯很小，我不想回去，生活在世界的边缘。但是活着有什么意义呢？我可以去找康士坦丁队长，他会给我戴上手铐和脚镣，有一天，他们会给我套上一根绳子，这样，我就可以安安稳稳地睡了。但是——这也不行；反正我也不知道。”","“I do not know; but Akatan is small, and I have little wish to go back and live on the edge of the world.Yet is there small use in life.I can go to Constantine, and he will put irons upon me, and one day they will tie a piece of rope, so, and I will sleep good.Yet—no; I do not know.”"
"“但是，基德，”普林斯抗议道，“这可是谋杀呀！”","“But, Kid,” protested Prince, “this is murder!”"
"“嘘！”马尔穆特·基德命令道，“有些事凭我们的智慧和公道标准是无法判断的。是对是错，我们也说不清楚，也不能由我们来判断。”","“Hush!” commanded Malemute Kid.“There be things greater than our wisdom, beyond our justice.The right and the wrong of this we cannot say, and it is not for us to judge.”"
"纳斯向火炉靠得越来越近了。四处一片寂静，每个人的眼睛里都涌现出一幅又一幅的画面。","Naass drew yet closer to the fire.There was a great silence, and in each man’s eyes many pictures came and went."
