"影子溪——《点金术》的引子","Shadow Brook.—Introductory to The Golden Touch"
"作者：纳撒尼尔·霍桑 ","by Nathaniel Hawthorne"
"中午，我们少年队在一个小山谷集合，山谷的深处有一条小溪流过。那个山谷很窄，溪流边缘上面的峭壁上长满了树，郁郁葱葱，主要是核桃树和栗树，中间还夹杂着几棵橡树和枫树。夏天的时候，枝繁叶茂的树枝相互交接或交叠着映射在小河上，形成的影子把正午的日光遮成了暮色。因此，小溪得名“影子溪”。但现在，自从秋天悄悄潜入这个幽僻安静的地方，一切苍翠色都变成了金黄色，因此，秋天使小山谷变得明亮起来而非遮蔽了它。即使是在阴天的时候，明亮金黄的叶子似乎也留住了间隙中的阳光；还有不少叶子飘落下来，在阳光的照耀下洒满了整个河床和小溪边缘。因此，在夏天时都阴凉的幽暗角落，这时变成了阳光最灿烂的地方。","At noon, our juvenile party assembled in a dell, through the depths of which ran a little brook.The dell was narrow, and its steep sides, from the margin of the stream upward, were thickly set with trees, chiefly walnuts and chestnuts, among which grew a few oaks and maples.In the summer time, the shade of so many clustering branches, meeting and intermingling across the rivulet, was deep enough to produce a noontide twilight.Hence came the name of Shadow Brook.But now, ever since autumn had crept into this secluded place, all the dark verdure was changed to gold, so that it really kindled up the dell, instead of shading it.The bright yellow leaves, even had it been a cloudy day, would have seemed to keep the sunlight among them; and enough of them had fallen to strew all the bed and margin of the brook with sunlight, too.Thus the shady nook, where summer had cooled herself, was now the sunniest spot anywhere to be found."
"小溪沿着那条金色的叶子铺成的河道，在这里停下来形成一个小水池。米诺鱼在水中穿来穿去，然后慌忙加快速度向前游去，仿佛急着赶到湖边，却又忘记仔细张望前行的方向，反被横亘的树根绊了个跟头。溪流喧闹地唠叨着这起事件，你若听见了定会大笑起来。而且即使小溪已经向前流去了，它依旧会喃喃自语，似乎在感到困惑。我想，当它发现昏暗的小山谷如此明亮，听见这么多孩子的欢声笑语，它一定会吓一跳。于是，它极其迅速地溜到湖里藏了起来。","The little brook ran along over its pathway of gold, here pausing to form a pool, in which minnows were darting to and fro; and then it hurried onward at a swifter pace, as if in haste to reach the lake; and, forgetting to look whither it went, it tumbled over the root of a tree, which stretched quite across its current.You would have laughed to hear how noisily it babbled about this accident.And even after it had run onward, the brook still kept talking to itself, as if it were in a maze.It was wonder-smitten, I suppose, at finding its dark dell so illuminated, and at hearing the prattle and merriment of so many children.So it stole away as quickly as it could, and hid itself in the lake."
"尤斯塔斯·布赖特和他的小伙伴们已经在影子溪的小山谷里吃过了饭。他们的篮子里有很多从坦格尔伍德买来的食物，他们将食物铺在树桩上和长满苔藓的树干上，美味的食物让他们愉快地饱餐了一顿。吃完了饭，大家都不想动弹了。","In the dell of Shadow Brook, Eustace Bright and his little friends had eaten their dinner.They had brought plenty of good things from Tanglewood, in their baskets, and had spread them out on the stumps of trees and on mossy trunks, and had feasted merrily, and made a very nice dinner indeed.After it was over, nobody felt like stirring."
"“我们就在这里休息，”其中的几个孩子说，“让尤斯塔斯·布赖特表哥再给我们讲一个精彩的故事。”","“We will rest ourselves here,” said several of the children, “while Cousin Eustace tells us another of his pretty stories.”"
"尤斯塔斯表哥和孩子们一样感到疲惫，这是正常的，因为在这个难忘的上午他的功劳可不小啊。蒲公英，红花草，黄花九轮草和毛茛几乎都确信他有一双带翅膀的拖鞋，就像山林水泽的仙女们给珀尔修斯的那双。所以通常前一秒他还站在地面上，后一秒就会跳上坚果树的顶端展示自己。之后，他使胡桃像雨一般地落下来，砸在他们头上，发出嘎嘎的响声，因为他们的小手正忙着把它们捡到篮子里。总而言之，他曾经像松鼠或猴子一样活跃敏捷。而现在，即使是飞扑到金黄的叶子上，他也似乎打算小歇一下。","Cousin Eustace had a good right to be tired, as well as the children, for he had performed great feats on that memorable forenoon.Dandelion, Clover, Cowslip, and Buttercup were almost persuaded that he had winged slippers, like those which the Nymphs gave Perseus; so often had the student shown himself at the tiptop of a nut-tree, when only a moment before he had been standing on the ground.And then, what showers of walnuts had he sent rattling down upon their heads, for their busy little hands to gather into the baskets!In short, he had been as active as a squirrel or a monkey, and now, flinging himself down on the yellow leaves, seemed inclined to take a little rest."
"但是，孩子们并不会因某个人的疲惫而心生怜悯或变得体贴，只要你还有一丝气息，他们也会让你给他们讲故事。","But children have no mercy nor consideration for anybody’s weariness; and if you had but a single breath left, they would ask you to spend it in telling them a story."
"“尤斯塔斯表哥，”黄花九轮草说，“《蛇怪之首》的故事很好听。你能再给我们讲一个那么好听的故事吗？”","“Cousin Eustace,” said Cowslip, “that was a very nice story of the Gorgon’s Head.Do you think you could tell us another as good?”"
"“当然了，孩子，”尤斯塔斯说，他把帽檐拉了拉，遮住眼，好像准备小睡片刻，“只要我愿意，我能给你们讲好多和那个一样好、甚至更好的故事。”","“Yes, child,” said Eustace, pulling the brim of his cap over his eyes, as if preparing for a nap.“I can tell you a dozen, as good or better, if I choose.”"
"“哇，报春花、长春花，你们听到他说的了吗？”黄花九轮草叫嚷着，高兴地手舞足蹈，“尤斯塔斯表哥要给我们讲一打比《蛇怪之首》还好听的故事哦！”","“O Primrose and Periwinkle, do you hear what he says?” cried Cowslip, dancing with delight.“Cousin Eustace is going to tell us a dozen better stories than that about the Gorgon’s Head!”"
"“我一个都没答应呢，黄花九轮草，你这个小傻瓜！”尤斯塔斯有点恼火地说，“但是我想你一定已经答应了。这就是赢得美誉的后果！真希望我比真实的我迟钝得多，或者我从来不曾施展过天赋才智的一半；那样的话，我就可以安静舒服地小憩一下了！”","“I did not promise you even one, you foolish little Cowslip!” said Eustace, half pettishly.“However, I suppose you must have it.This is the consequence of having earned a reputation!I wish I were a great deal duller than I am, or that I had never shown half the bright qualities with which nature has endowed me; and then I might have my nap out, in peace and comfort!”"
"然而正如我之前提到的，尤斯塔斯表哥喜欢讲故事，就和孩子们喜欢听故事一样。那时他的思维正处于自由而愉快的状态，并以它自己的活动为乐趣，而且几乎不需要任何外来的刺激促使它运转。","But Cousin Eustace, as I think I have hinted before, was as fond of telling his stories as the children of hearing them.His mind was in a free and happy state, and took delight in its own activity, and scarcely required any external impulse to set it at work."
"这种自发的思维活动和经过多年勤奋训练而日渐成熟的思维是多么不同。这期间由于长期的习惯，辛劳也许不再让人觉得痛苦，一天的工作也许会让人觉得舒坦，尽管其他的事情都被忽视了！然而，这话并不是说给孩子们听的。","How different is this spontaneous play of the intellect from the trained diligence of maturer years, when toil has perhaps grown easy by long habit, and the day’s work may have become essential to the day’s comfort, although the rest of the matter has bubbled away!This remark, however, is not meant for the children to hear."
"不用再次恳求，尤斯塔斯·布赖特就继续讲述了下面这个十分精彩的故事。这个故事可能是他躺着，向上看着一棵参天大树，观察秋天是怎样将每一片绿叶染成纯金般颜色的时候想出来的。而我们看到的变化和尤斯塔斯所讲述的迈达斯的故事一样神奇。","Without further solicitation, Eustace Bright proceeded to tell the following really splendid story.It had come into his mind as he lay looking upward into the depths of a tree, and observing how the touch of Autumn had transmuted every one of its green leaves into what resembled the purest gold.And this change, which we have all of us witnessed, is as wonderful as anything that Eustace told about in the story of Midas."
"点金术","The Golden Touch"
"从前，有一个非常富有的国王，名叫迈达斯。这个国王有一个小女儿，除了我，没有人听说过她，而她的名字，我要么从来不知道，要么是彻底忘记了。因为我比较喜欢给小女孩们起些古怪的名字，所以我决定叫她玛丽戈尔德。","Once upon a time, there lived a very rich man, and a king besides, whose name was Midas; and he had a little daughter, whom nobody but myself ever heard of, and whose name I either never knew, or have entirely forgotten.So, because I love odd names for little girls, I choose to call her Marygold."
"在这个世界上，迈达斯国王最喜欢金子。他之所以对他的皇冠爱不释手，主要是因为皇冠是由珍贵的金子做成的。如果说他有更喜欢的事物，或喜爱程度有金子一半的话，那就是围着爸爸的脚蹬玩得兴高采烈的小女孩了。但是，迈达斯越喜爱他的女儿，他追求和寻找财富的欲望就越强烈。这个愚蠢的人啊！他认为他能为这个心爱的孩子做的最好事情就是给她留下巨额的金光闪闪的硬币，而且是自从有世以来就开始积累的硬币。因此，为了实现这个目的，他花费了所有的心思和时间。假如他碰巧看见落日时分镶满金边的彩霞，他就希望它们是真的金子，而且还可以把它们安全地塞进他坚固的储钱箱里。当小玛丽戈尔德拿着一束毛茛和蒲公英奔跑着去见他时，他经常说：“哦，哦，孩子！如果这些花如它们看上去的那样，是真的金子，它们就值得摘了！”","This King Midas was fonder of gold than of anything else in the world.He valued his royal crown chiefly because it was composed of that precious metal.If he loved anything better, or half so well, it was the one little maiden who played so merrily around her father’s footstool.But the more Midas loved his daughter, the more did he desire and seek for wealth.He thought, foolish man! that the best thing he could possibly do for this dear child would be to bequeath her the immensest pile of yellow, glistening coin, that had ever been heaped together since the world was made.Thus, he gave all his thoughts and all his time to this one purpose.If ever he happened to gaze for an instant at the gold-tinted clouds of sunset, he wished that they were real gold, and that they could be squeezed safely into his strong box.When little Marygold ran to meet him, with a bunch of buttercups and dandelions, he used to say, “Poh, poh, child!If these flowers were as golden as they look, they would be worth the plucking!”"
"然而，当他还年轻、还没有被占有财富的疯狂欲望完全支配之前，迈达斯国王对花特别有鉴赏力。他曾经种植了一个花园，花园里种着花朵最大、最漂亮、最芳香的玫瑰花，任何普通人都不曾见过或闻过。迈达斯过去常常要花上一整天，全神贯注地欣赏它们，深深地呼吸它们的芬芳。这些玫瑰花依然种在花园里，依旧那么大，那么娇艳，那么芳香馥郁，和过去一样。但现在，如果他去看它们的话，那也只是为了计算假设这些数不胜数的玫瑰花瓣是一个个薄薄的金盘子，花园该有多值钱。而且，尽管他曾经喜欢音乐（即使关于他的耳朵有一个荒唐的故事，那就是据说它们长得像驴耳朵），如今，对可怜的迈达斯来说，唯一的音乐只有金币相互碰撞时发出的叮当声了。","And yet, in his earlier days, before he was so entirely possessed of this insane desire for riches, King Midas had shown a great taste for flowers.He had planted a garden, in which grew the biggest and beautifullest and sweetest roses that any mortal ever saw or smelt.These roses were still growing in the garden, as large, as lovely, and as fragrant, as when Midas used to pass whole hours in gazing at them, and inhaling their perfume.But now, if he looked at them at all, it was only to calculate how much the garden would be worth if each of the innumerable rose-petals were a thin plate of gold.And though he once was fond of music (in spite of an idle story about his ears, which were said to resemble those of an ass), the only music for poor Midas, now, was the chink of one coin against another."
"（人们要小心谨慎，才能变得越来越聪明，否则他们总是变得越来越愚蠢）终于，迈达斯变得极其荒唐，他几乎不能忍受看见或碰到任何不是金子的东西。因此，他养成了一个习惯，那就是每天花费很大一部分时间呆在他宫殿地下室一间昏暗沉闷的房间里。这就是他收藏财富的地方。这个阴暗的地洞——比地牢好不到哪去——每当迈达斯想变得特别愉快的时候，他就来这里。他小心翼翼地锁上这里的门之后，会拿起一袋金币，或者一个跟洗脸盆差不多大小的金水杯，要么是一根沉甸甸的金条，或一配克的金子粉末，然后把它们从房间阴暗偏僻的角落移到明亮而纤细的阳光透过地牢般的窗户照射的地方。他珍视这些阳光不是因为别的，仅仅是因为没有阳光，他的财宝就不会闪闪发光。然后，他就会把袋子里的硬币一枚一枚地数；他还向上抛金条，在它落下来时再抓住；他让金子粉末在手指间滤过；他看着金杯抛光的周缘反射出来的自己脸部有趣的映象，自言自语地说：“哦，迈达斯，富有的迈达斯国王，你是个多么幸福的人啊！”然而,可笑的是,他的脸在金杯抛光表面上的映像也在咧着嘴朝他笑。映像似乎意识到他行为的愚蠢，而且有点恶作剧地嘲弄他的意思。","At length (as people always grow more and more foolish, unless they take care to grow wiser and wiser), Midas had got to be so exceedingly unreasonable, that he could scarcely bear to see or touch any object that was not gold.He made it his custom, therefore, to pass a large portion of every day in a dark and dreary apartment, under ground, at the basement of his palace.It was here that he kept his wealth.To this dismal hole—for it was little better than a dungeon—Midas betook himself, whenever he wanted to be particularly happy.Here, after carefully locking the door, he would take a bag of gold coin, or a gold cup as big as a washbowl, or a heavy golden bar, or a peck-measure of gold-dust, and bring them from the obscure corners of the room into the one bright and narrow sunbeam that fell from the dungeon-like window.He valued the sunbeam for no other reason but that his treasure would not shine without its help.And then would he reckon over the coins in the bag; toss up the bar, and catch it as it came down; sift the gold-dust through his fingers; look at the funny image of his own face, as reflected in the burnished circumference of the cup; and whisper to himself, “O Midas, rich King Midas, what a happy man art thou!”But it was laughable to see how the image of his face kept grinning at him, out of the polished surface of the cup.It seemed to be aware of his foolish behavior, and to have a naughty inclination to make fun of him."
"迈达斯称自己是个幸福的人，但他觉得自己还可以更幸福。他永远不会到达幸福的巅峰，除非整个世界都变成他的藏宝室，里面装满属于他自己的闪闪发光的金子。","Midas called himself a happy man, but felt that he was not yet quite so happy as he might be.The very tiptop of enjoyment would never be reached, unless the whole world were to become his treasure-room, and be filled with yellow metal which should be all his own."
"现在，我几乎不需要提醒像你们这样聪明的人，在非常古老的年代，当迈达斯国王还活着的时候，发生了许多事情，如果那些事情发生在我们的时代、我们的国家里，我们一定会认为那是无比神奇的。反过来，现在发生的很多事情，不仅我们觉得奇怪，古代的人也会目瞪口呆。总的来说，我认为我们的时代比古代更异乎寻常；但是，无论怎样，我都必须继续我的故事。","Now, I need hardly remind such wise little people as you are, that in the old, old times, when King Midas was alive, a great many things came to pass, which we should consider wonderful if they were to happen in our own day and country.And, on the other hand, a great many things take place nowadays, which seem not only wonderful to us, but at which the people of old times would have stared their eyes out.On the whole, I regard our own times as the strangest of the two; but, however that may be, I must go on with my story."
"一天，迈达斯国王正像往常一样，在他的藏宝室里自我陶醉。忽然他觉察到一个黑影落在金子堆上，猛地抬头一看，他竟看到明亮而纤细的光束里站着一个陌生人！这是个青年人，有着愉悦的面容，红润的脸颊。不管是迈达斯国王的幻想使这里的一切都蒙上一层金黄色，还是其他什么原因，他都禁不住想象这个陌生人在注视他时，笑容里带着一种金色的光辉。当然，尽管那个身影挡住了阳光，但这些成堆的财宝却比以前更加光彩夺目。那个陌生人在微笑时，即使最偏远的角落都被照得明亮，仿佛在跳跃的火苗或火花的映照下一般。","Midas was enjoying himself in his treasure-room, one day, as usual, when he perceived a shadow fall over the heaps of gold; and, looking suddenly up, what should he behold but the figure of a stranger, standing in the bright and narrow sunbeam!It was a young man, with a cheerful and ruddy face.Whether it was that the imagination of King Midas threw a yellow tinge over everything, or whatever the cause might be, he could not help fancying that the smile with which the stranger regarded him had a kind of golden radiance in it.Certainly, although his figure intercepted the sunshine, there was now a brighter gleam upon all the piled-up treasures than before.Even the remotest corners had their share of it, and were lighted up, when the stranger smiled, as with tips of flame and sparkles of fire."
"因为迈达斯明白，他已经小心地锁上了门，任何凡人的力量都不可能闯入他的藏宝室，于是，他得出结论，他的拜访者一定不是一个普通人。告诉你们他是谁并不重要。那时候，地球还比较年轻，经常有被赋予了超能力的人物出现，他们抱着半是取乐半是严肃的态度沉迷于人类的喜怒哀乐。之前，迈达斯曾经遇见过这种人物，再见到他们中的一个也不会感到意外。那个陌生人相貌确实和蔼可亲，很友好，如果算不上仁慈，也称得上善良，根本没有理由怀疑他有任何一丁点使坏的念头。他很有可能是来帮助迈达斯的。当然除了让他的财宝成倍增长之外，还能帮什么忙呢？","As Midas knew that he had carefully turned the key in the lock, and that no mortal strength could possibly break into his treasure-room, he, of course, concluded that his visitor must be something more than mortal.It is no matter about telling you who he was.In those days, when the earth was comparatively a new affair, it was supposed to be often the resort of beings endowed with supernatural power, and who used to interest themselves in the joys and sorrows of men, women, and children, half playfully and half seriously.Midas had met such beings before now, and was not sorry to meet one of them again.The stranger’s aspect, indeed, was so good-humored and kindly, if not beneficent, that it would have been unreasonable to suspect him of intending any mischief.It was far more probable that he came to do Midas a favor.And what could that favor be, unless to multiply his heaps of treasure?"
"那个陌生人环视着整个房间，当他灿烂的笑容照亮屋里所有的金质物品时，他又转向迈达斯。","The stranger gazed about the room; and when his lustrous smile had glistened upon all the golden objects that were there, he turned again to Midas."
"“你真是个有钱人，迈达斯朋友！”他说，“我怀疑世界上是否还有另一间房子，装着和你煞费苦心在这间房里堆出的一样多的金子。”","“You are a wealthy man, friend Midas!” he observed.“I doubt whether any other four walls, on earth, contain so much gold as you have contrived to pile up in this room.”"
"“我做得很不错——相当不错，”迈达斯不满足地回答，“但是，毕竟，这太微不足道了，要知道积攒这些财宝花费了我一生的时间。如果一个人可以活一千年，也许他就有时间积累财富了！”","“I have done pretty well,—pretty well,” answered Midas, in a discontented tone.“But, after all, it is but a trifle, when you consider that it has taken me my whole life to get it together.If one could live a thousand years, he might have time to grow rich!”"
"“什么！”陌生人惊叫道，“你还不满足？”","“What!” exclaimed the stranger.“Then you are not satisfied?”"
"迈达斯摇摇头。","Midas shook his head."
"“那么请问什么才会使你满足呢？”陌生人问道，“我很愿意了解，仅仅出于好奇而已。”","“And pray what would satisfy you?” asked the stranger.“Merely for the curiosity of the thing, I should be glad to know.”"
"迈达斯停下来，陷入了思考。他有一种预感，这个友善笑容里流露着金子般光彩的陌生人不仅拥有某种可以满足他最大愿望的力量，而且这正是这个陌生人来这里的目的。所以，现在就是发财的时刻，只要他开口，他就能获得脑子里想到的东西，无论是任何可能的还是似乎不可能的东西。所以，他想啊想，想啊想，脑海里堆积了一座又一座金山，但怎么想，都觉得它们不够大。终于，迈达斯国王想到了一个好主意。这个主意似乎真的就像他极其喜爱的金光闪闪的金子一样，绝妙极了。","Midas paused and meditated.He felt a presentiment that this stranger, with such a golden lustre in his good-humored smile, had come hither with both the power and the purpose of gratifying his utmost wishes.Now, therefore, was the fortunate moment, when he had but to speak, and obtain whatever possible, or seemingly impossible thing, it might come into his head to ask.So he thought, and thought, and thought, and heaped up one golden mountain upon another, in his imagination, without being able to imagine them big enough.At last, a bright idea occurred to King Midas.It seemed really as bright as the glistening metal which he loved so much."
"他抬起头，看着陌生人神采奕奕的面孔。","Raising his head, he looked the lustrous stranger in the face."
"“好了，迈达斯，”他的拜访者说，“我知道你终于想到能满足你的东西了。告诉我你的愿望吧。”","“Well, Midas,” observed his visitor, “I see that you have at length hit upon something that will satisfy you.Tell me your wish.”"
"“就是这样的，”迈达斯回答，“我费尽了周折，使出浑身解数才收集了这么一小堆财宝，我厌倦了收集财宝。我希望我触摸到的一切都能变成金子！”","“It is only this,” replied Midas.“I am weary of collecting my treasures with so much trouble, and beholding the heap so diminutive, after I have done my best.I wish everything that I touch to be changed to gold!”"
"陌生人大笑起来，笑声响彻了整个房间，就像迸发的太阳，照亮了整个阴暗的小山谷,那里金黄的秋叶——就像大块小块的金子闪闪发光——在阳光的照射下撒了一地。","The stranger’s smile grew so very broad, that it seemed to fill the room like an outburst of the sun, gleaming into a shadowy dell, where the yellow autumnal leaves—for so looked the lumps and particles of gold—lie strewn in the glow of light."
"“点金术！”他惊叫起来，“你真值得称赞，迈达斯朋友，能想出来这么一个绝妙的主意。但是你肯定这会满足你吗？”","“The Golden Touch!” exclaimed he.“You certainly deserve credit, friend Midas, for striking out so brilliant a conception.But are you quite sure that this will satisfy you?”"
"“怎么不会呢？”迈达斯问。","“How could it fail?” said Midas."
"“会了这种法术，你永远不会后悔？”","“And will you never regret the possession of it?”"
"“你到底想让我说什么？”迈达斯问，“只要让我感到绝对的幸福，我就别无他求了。”","“What could induce me?” asked Midas.“I ask nothing else, to render me perfectly happy.”"
"“那么，就如你所愿吧，”陌生人说着，挥手告别，“明天，太阳升起的时候，你就会发现你自己会点金术了。”","“Be it as you wish, then,” replied the stranger, waving his hand in token of farewell.“To-morrow, at sunrise, you will find yourself gifted with the Golden Touch.”"
"接着，陌生人的身体变得格外耀眼，迈达斯不由自主地闭上眼睛。等到再睁开眼睛的时候，只见到屋内的一束金黄色阳光，还有周围他花费了毕生心血才囤积起来的闪闪发光的珍贵的金子。","The figure of the stranger then became exceedingly bright, and Midas involuntarily closed his eyes.On opening them again, he beheld only one yellow sunbeam in the room, and, all around him, the glistening of the precious metal which he had spent his life in hoarding up."
"那晚，迈达斯是否像往常一样安然入睡，故事里并没有说。无论是睡着还是醒着，他的思想都可能处于兴奋状态，就像孩子得到许诺早上会拥有一件崭新的漂亮玩具一样。总而言之，在山边还没露一点曙光的时候，迈达斯国王就完全睡醒了。他把胳膊伸到床外，开始去摸能够到的东西。他急切地想要证明那个陌生人说过的他已经拥有点金术的诺言是真是假。因此，他把手指放在床边的椅子和其他各种不同的东西上，然而他非常失望地意识到它们没有丝毫变化，和被触摸之前完全一样。的确，他非常担心自己只不过是在梦中遇到了那个金光耀眼的陌生人，或者陌生人只是给他开了个玩笑。如果迈达斯寄予了所有希望，却不得不满足于用通常的方法积攒金子，不能如愿地只要碰一碰就能拥有巨额的财富，那是多么悲惨啊！","Whether Midas slept as usual that night, the story does not say.Asleep or awake, however, his mind was probably in the state of a child’s, to whom a beautiful new plaything has been promised in the morning.At any rate, day had hardly peeped over the hills, when King Midas was broad awake, and, stretching his arms out of bed, began to touch the objects that were within reach.He was anxious to prove whether the Golden Touch had really come, according to the stranger’s promise.So he laid his finger on a chair by the bedside, and on various other things, but was grievously disappointed to perceive that they remained of exactly the same substance as before.Indeed, he felt very much afraid that he had only dreamed about the lustrous stranger, or else that the latter had been making game of him.And what a miserable affair would it be, if, after all his hopes, Midas must content himself with what little gold he could scrape together by ordinary means, instead of creating it by a touch!"
"其实，迈达斯没有看见刚才那会儿天才微亮，天边只有一道鱼肚白。他躺在床上，郁郁寡欢，为自己愿望的落空而遗憾，变得越来越悲伤。直到最早的一束阳光透过窗户射进来，为他头顶上的天花板镶上一层金边。对于迈达斯来说，这束明亮的金黄色阳光似乎是以一种异常的方式折射到白色床罩上的。贴近一看，他又惊又喜，因为发现这个亚麻料床罩似乎已经变成了最耀眼最纯正的金纺织品！点金术果然随着第一束阳光的降临变成了现实！","All this while, it was only the gray of the morning, with but a streak of brightness along the edge of the sky, where Midas could not see it.He lay in a very disconsolate mood, regretting the downfall of his hopes, and kept growing sadder and sadder, until the earliest sunbeam shone through the window, and gilded the ceiling over his head.It seemed to Midas that this bright yellow sunbeam was reflected in rather a singular way on the white covering of the bed.Looking more closely, what was his astonishment and delight, when he found that this linen fabric had been transmuted to what seemed a woven texture of the purest and brightest gold!The Golden Touch had come to him with the first sunbeam!"
"迈达斯欣喜若狂地跳起来，开始在房间里乱跑，路上看到什么就抓起什么。他抓住一根床柱，那根柱子马上就变成一个饰有凹槽的金柱子。他拉开窗帘，以便更好地看清他创造奇迹的壮观场面，他手里的流苏竟变成沉甸甸的——一堆金子。他从桌子上拿起一本书。他刚碰到书，书就变成我们今天经常见到的装订精美而且镶有金边的书籍，但，当他翻弄了一下书页，看啊！书就变成了一捆薄薄的金片，书中的一切承载着智慧的字迹都变得难以辨认。他迅速穿上衣服，却惊喜的发现自己穿着一套富丽堂皇的黄金盛装。尽管这衣服让他感觉有些沉重，但是还保留着它本有的灵活和柔软。他掏出小玛丽戈尔德为他缝了边的手帕。它同样变成了金子，四周虽留着心爱的孩子缝制的整齐漂亮的针脚，却是用金线缝起来的！","Midas started up, in a kind of joyful frenzy, and ran about the room, grasping at everything that happened to be in his way.He seized one of the bed-posts, and it became immediately a fluted golden pillar.He pulled aside a window-curtain, in order to admit a clear spectacle of the wonders which he was performing; and the tassel grew heavy in his hand,—a mass of gold.He took up a book from the table.At his first touch, it assumed the appearance of such a splendidly bound and gilt-edged volume as one often meets with, nowadays; but, on running his fingers through the leaves, behold! it was a bundle of thin golden plates, in which all the wisdom of the book had grown illegible.He hurriedly put on his clothes, and was enraptured to see himself in a magnificent suit of gold cloth, which retained its flexibility and softness, although it burdened him a little with its weight.He drew out his handkerchief, which little Marygold had hemmed for him.That was likewise gold, with the dear child’s neat and pretty stitches running all along the border, in gold thread!"
"不知道为什么，手帕的这一变化并没有让迈达斯国王感到高兴。他宁愿小女儿的针线活和当初她爬上他的膝盖放到他手里的一样。","Somehow or other, this last transformation did not quite please King Midas.He would rather that his little daughter’s handiwork should have remained just the same as when she climbed his knee and put it into his hand."
"但是，他不值得为这点小事恼火。这会儿，迈达斯从口袋里掏出眼镜，戴在鼻子上，以便将周围的事物看得更清楚。那个年代，还没有发明老百姓戴的眼镜，但国王早就戴上了，不然，迈达斯怎么会有一副呢?然而，令他困惑的是，即使是这么好的眼镜，他发现自己透过眼镜什么都看不见。但是，这是世界上最正常不过的事情了，因为，他把眼镜摘下来一看，透明的水晶眼镜变成了黄色的金属片。当然了，虽然和金子一样珍贵，但作为眼镜，它已经毫无价值。这给迈达斯带来很大不便，因为无论多么有钱，他永远都不能再买一副可以用的眼镜了。","But it was not worthwhile to vex himself about a trifle.Midas now took his spectacles from his pocket, and put them on his nose, in order that he might see more distinctly what he was about.In those days, spectacles for common people had not been invented, but were already worn by kings; else, how could Midas have had any?To his great perplexity, however, excellent as the glasses were, he discovered that he could not possibly see through them.But this was the most natural thing in the world; for, on taking them off, the transparent crystal turned out to be plates of yellow metal, and, of course, were worthless as spectacles, though valuable as gold.It struck Midas as rather inconvenient that, with all his wealth, he could never again be rich enough to own a pair of serviceable spectacles."
"“但是，没什么大不了的，”他富有哲理地自言自语道，“我们不能期待完美无缺，连这么点小小的瑕疵都没有吧。","“It is no great matter, nevertheless,” said he to himself, very philosophically.“We cannot expect any great good, without its being accompanied with some small inconvenience."
"我的眼睛还是能满足日常需要的，小玛丽戈尔德很快就会长大读书给我听。”","My own eyes will serve for ordinary purposes, and little Marygold will soon be old enough to read to me.”"
"聪明的迈达斯国王为他的巨额财富欣喜若狂，似乎整个宫殿都容不下他了。于是，他微笑着走下楼梯，看着往下走时手扶过的楼梯栏杆变成了一条闪闪发光的金子。他拉起门闩（刚才门闩还是黄铜的，但拿开手指时，就变成了金子），然后进入花园。正如所料到的，他在这里看见了许多盛开的漂亮玫瑰花，还有其他许多处在各种花期惹人喜爱的花蕾和花朵。它们的芳香在清晨的微风中更加沁人心脾。娇嫩的红灿灿的花朵是世界上最漂亮的风景之一，它们看起来那么柔美、朴素、恬静。","Wise King Midas was so exalted by his good fortune, that the palace seemed not sufficiently spacious to contain him.He therefore went downstairs, and smiled, on observing that the balustrade of the staircase became a bar of burnished gold, as his hand passed over it, in his descent.He lifted the door-latch (it was brass only a moment ago, but golden when his fingers quitted it), and emerged into the garden.Here, as it happened, he found a great number of beautiful roses in full bloom, and others in all the stages of lovely bud and blossom.Very delicious was their fragrance in the morning breeze.Their delicate blush was one of the fairest sights in the world; so gentle, so modest, and so full of sweet tranquillity, did these roses seem to be."
"但在迈达斯脑海里，他知道一种让它们变得更加珍贵的方法。因此，他不厌其烦地从一簇花到另一簇花，直到每一朵花、每个花蕾都被他不辞辛苦地施展过神奇的点金术，甚至有些花心里的虫子都变成了金子。当这项伟大的工程完成时，下人通知迈达斯国王该吃早餐了。早晨的空气让他胃口大开，所以他迅速地赶回宫殿了。","But Midas knew a way to make them far more precious, according to his way of thinking, than roses had ever been before.So he took great pains in going from bush to bush, and exercised his magic touch most indefatigably; until every individual flower and bud, and even the worms at the heart of some of them, were changed to gold.By the time this good work was completed, King Midas was summoned to breakfast; and as the morning air had given him an excellent appetite, he made haste back to the palace."
"我真的不知道，在迈达斯的年代，国王的早餐都有些什么，但现在也不能停下来调查。然而，我相信，在这个特殊的早晨，为迈达斯准备的早餐包括热腾腾的糕点、一些可爱的小溪鲑、烤土豆、刚煮熟的鸡蛋还有咖啡，为他女儿玛丽戈尔德准备的是一碗牛奶和面包。不管怎样，这是一份适合摆在国王面前的早餐；而且，不管他吃过没有，迈达斯都不可能有比这更美味的早餐了。","What was usually a king’s breakfast in the days of Midas, I really do not know, and cannot stop now to investigate.To the best of my belief, however, on this particular morning, the breakfast consisted of hot cakes, some nice little brook trout, roasted potatoes, fresh boiled eggs, and coffee, for King Midas himself, and a bowl of bread and milk for his daughter Marygold.At all events, this is a breakfast fit to set before a king; and, whether he had it or not, King Midas could not have had a better."
"小玛丽戈尔德现在还没有到。国王下令把她叫过来，然后自己坐上桌，等着她的到来，好开始吃早餐。公正地说，迈达斯真的非常喜欢他的女儿，由于巨额财富的降临，今天早晨就更加喜爱她了。不一会儿，他就听到她沿着走廊走来时悲痛的哭声。这种场景让他大吃一惊，因为玛丽戈尔德是你可能见过的最快乐的孩子之一，她在夏天，甚至是一年十二个月里都几乎不掉一丁点眼泪。迈达斯听到她的哭泣声时，决定给小玛丽戈尔德一个惊喜，好让她高兴起来。因此，他侧身过去，摸了摸她女儿的碗（一个陶瓷碗，上面都是漂亮的人物），把它变成了金光闪闪的金碗。","Little Marygold had not yet made her appearance.Her father ordered her to be called, and, seating himself at table, awaited the child’s coming, in order to begin his own breakfast.To do Midas justice, he really loved his daughter, and loved her so much the more this morning, on account of the good fortune which had befallen him.It was not a great while before he heard her coming along the passageway crying bitterly.This circumstance surprised him, because Marygold was one of the cheerfullest little people whom you would see in a summer’s day, and hardly shed a thimbleful of tears in a twelvemonth.When Midas heard her sobs, he determined to put little Marygold into better spirits, by an agreeable surprise; so, leaning across the table, he touched his daughter’s bowl (which was a China one, with pretty figures all around it), and transmuted it to gleaming gold."
"这时，玛丽戈尔德沮丧地慢慢打开门，用围裙捂着眼睛，不停地啜泣着，仿佛她的心都要碎了。","Meanwhile, Marygold slowly and disconsolately opened the door, and showed herself with her apron at her eyes, still sobbing as if her heart would break."
"“这是怎么回事，我的宝贝小姐！”迈达斯惊叫道，“请问这么阳光明媚的早晨，你怎么哭了呢？”","“How now, my little lady!” cried Midas.“Pray what is the matter with you, this bright morning?”"
"小玛丽戈尔德一边不停用围裙擦眼泪，一边伸出手里拿着迈达斯刚刚变出的金玫瑰。","Marygold, without taking the apron from her eyes, held out her hand, in which was one of the roses which Midas had so recently transmuted."
"“好漂亮啊！”她的爸爸惊叹道，“这么漂亮的金玫瑰怎么会让你哭呢？”","“Beautiful!” exclaimed her father.“And what is there in this magnificent golden rose to make you cry?”"
"“啊，亲爱的爸爸！”孩子回答，不住地抽噎着，“它不仅不漂亮，而且还是所有盛开的花中最难看的！我一穿上衣服就跑去花园里采些玫瑰给你，因为我知道你喜欢它们，而且更喜欢你的宝贝女儿摘的。可是，哦，天，天哪！你知道发生了什么事吗？糟糕极了！所有漂亮、清香扑鼻、鲜红可爱的玫瑰花，现在都枯萎和焦败了！它们变得非常枯黄，就像你看到的这朵，再也没有芳香！它们到底怎么了？”","“Ah, dear father!” answered the child, as well as her sobs would let her; “it is not beautiful, but the ugliest flower that ever grew!As soon as I was dressed I ran into the garden to gather some roses for you; because I know you like them, and like them the better when gathered by your little daughter.But, oh dear, dear me!What do you think has happened?Such a misfortune!All the beautiful roses, that smelled so sweetly and had so many lovely blushes, are blighted and spoilt!They are grown quite yellow, as you see this one, and have no longer any fragrance!What can have been the matter with them?”"
"“哦，我亲爱的小姑娘——请不要为这个伤心了！”迈达斯说。他很不好意思承认是自己的点金术才让她如此伤心。“坐下来，吃面包，喝牛奶吧!你会发现用一朵像那样的金玫瑰（可以保存几百年）换一朵一天之内就会凋谢的普通玫瑰花实在太容易了。”","“Poh, my dear little girl,—pray don’t cry about it!” said Midas, who was ashamed to confess that he himself had wrought the change which so greatly afflicted her.“Sit down and eat your bread and milk!You will find it easy enough to exchange a golden rose like that (which will last hundreds of years) for an ordinary one which would wither in a day.”"
"“我才不在乎这样的玫瑰！”小玛丽戈尔德叫嚷道，不屑地把它扔掉了，“它一点香味都没有，坚硬的花瓣还扎着了我的鼻子！”","“I don’t care for such roses as this!” cried Marygold, tossing it contemptuously away.“It has no smell, and the hard petals prick my nose!”"
" 她坐在桌旁，枯萎的玫瑰花让她太伤心了，甚至都没注意到她的陶瓷碗所发生的绝妙变化。可能这也是好事，因为玛丽戈尔德经常陶醉于看碗周围画的那些奇特的小人，怪异的树和房子，而现在这些装饰都已经在金子的色调中完全消失了。","The child now sat down to table, but was so occupied with her grief for the blighted roses that she did not even notice the wonderful transmutation of her China bowl.Perhaps this was all the better; for Marygold was accustomed to take pleasure in looking at the queer figures, and strange trees and houses, that were painted on the circumference of the bowl; and these ornaments were now entirely lost in the yellow hue of the metal."
"同时，迈达斯倒了一杯咖啡，当然，无论他拿起来时是什么金属，当他放下时，咖啡壶已经变成金的了。他心里想，以他作为国王一向俭朴的习惯来说，吃早餐用一整套金餐具实在是太过奢侈了，同时他也开始担心财宝的安全。橱柜和厨房不再是储藏像金碗和咖啡壶之类贵重物品的安全地方。","Midas, meanwhile, had poured out a cup of coffee, and, as a matter of course, the coffee-pot, whatever metal it may have been when he took it up, was gold when he set it down.He thought to himself, that it was rather an extravagant style of splendor, in a king of his simple habits, to breakfast off a service of gold, and began to be puzzled with the difficulty of keeping his treasures safe.The cupboard and the kitchen would no longer be a secure place of deposit for articles so valuable as golden bowls and coffee-pots."
"他一边想，一边把一汤勺咖啡放到嘴唇，当他吮吸的时候，竟然惊奇的发现，咖啡刚碰到他嘴唇的那一刻，就变成了熔化的金子，紧接着就硬成一块！","Amid these thoughts, he lifted a spoonful of coffee to his lips, and, sipping it, was astonished to perceive that, the instant his lips touched the liquid, it became molten gold, and, the next moment, hardened into a lump!"
"“啊！”迈达斯惊叫起来，目瞪口呆。","“Ha!” exclaimed Midas, rather aghast."
"“怎么了，爸爸？”小玛丽戈尔德问道，注视着他，眼里仍然噙着泪水。","“What is the matter, father?” asked little Marygold, gazing at him, with the tears still standing in her eyes."
"“没什么，孩子，没事！”迈达斯说，“喝你的牛奶吧，要不就变凉了。”","“Nothing, child, nothing!” said Midas.“Eat your milk, before it gets quite cold.”"
"他拿起盘子里一条美味的小鲑鱼，实验性地用手指碰了下它的尾巴。令他恐惧的是，它立刻从一条让人垂涎三尺的油煎溪鲑鱼变成了金子鱼，尽管不是一条人们经常养在球状玻璃容器里用来装饰客厅的金鱼。不，但是它确实是一条金属制的鱼，而且精巧得看上去像是由世界上手艺最精湛的金匠做成的。它的小骨头现在已经变成了金线，它的鳍和尾巴变成了薄薄的金片，上面还有叉子插过的痕迹，在一条美味的煎鱼身上所有这些微小、精巧的外表完全通过金子模仿出来了。那是一件非常精致的作品，你们也许会想。就在那时，只有迈达斯国王宁愿他盘子里的是一条真鲑鱼，而不是这条精心制作的、珍贵的仿制鱼。","He took one of the nice little trouts on his plate, and, by way of experiment, touched its tail with his finger.To his horror, it was immediately transmuted from an admirably fried brook-trout into a gold-fish, though not one of those gold-fishes which people often keep in glass globes, as ornaments for the parlor.No; but it was really a metallic fish, and looked as if it had been very cunningly made by the nicest goldsmith in the world.Its little bones were now golden wires; its fins and tail were thin plates of gold; and there were the marks of the fork in it, and all the delicate, frothy appearance of a nicely fried fish, exactly imitated in metal.A very pretty piece of work, as you may suppose; only King Midas, just at that moment, would much rather have had a real trout in his dish than this elaborate and valuable imitation of one."
"“我不是太明白，”他在心里想，“我怎样才能吃点早餐。”","“I don’t quite see,” thought he to himself, “how I am to get any breakfast.”"
"他拿起一块冒着热气的糕点，几乎没有弄碎，但是让他无比难堪的是，蛋糕立刻就变成了印第安饭一样的黄色，虽然片刻之前它还是纯白的小麦面。事实上，如果它真的是热的印第安糕点，迈达斯将会尤其珍视，而不是像现在这样，硬邦邦的越发沉重的糕点使他痛苦地意识到这是金子。近乎绝望之中，他拿起一个煮熟的鸡蛋，然而，鸡蛋立即发生了与鲑鱼和糕点一样的变化。的确，金蛋可能被误认为故事书里有名的经常下金蛋的鹅下的，但是唯有迈达斯国王才是和那件事有点关系的鹅。","He took one of the smoking-hot cakes, and had scarcely broken it, when, to his cruel mortification, though, a moment before, it had been of the whitest wheat, it assumed the yellow hue of Indian meal.To say the truth, if it had really been a hot Indian cake, Midas would have prized it a good deal more than he now did, when its solidity and increased weight made him too bitterly sensible that it was gold.Almost in despair, he helped himself to a boiled egg, which immediately underwent a change similar to those of the trout and the cake.The egg, indeed, might have been mistaken for one of those which the famous goose, in the story-book, was in the habit of laying; but King Midas was the only goose that had anything to do with the matter."
"“好吧，这真是窘迫！”他想，向后倾斜靠在椅子上，非常嫉妒地看着小玛丽戈尔德很满足地吃着面包喝着牛奶。“如此丰盛的早餐摆在我面前，却什么都吃不成！”","“Well, this is a quandary!” thought he, leaning back in his chair, and looking quite enviously at little Marygold, who was now eating her bread and milk with great satisfaction.“Such a costly breakfast before me, and nothing that can be eaten!”"
"他希望自己可以通过加快速度避免现在诸多的不便。于是，迈达斯国王伸手抓起一个发烫的土豆，使劲把它往嘴里塞，然后急匆匆地往下咽。但是点金术对他太灵敏了。他发现自己塞了满嘴的不是粉状的土豆，而是固体金属，金属烫着了他的舌头，弄得他大喊大叫，从桌子旁跳了起来。由于疼痛和惊恐，他开始在房间里乱跳乱蹦。","Hoping that, by dint of great dispatch, he might avoid what he now felt to be a considerable inconvenience, King Midas next snatched a hot potato, and attempted to cram it into his mouth, and swallow it in a hurry.But the Golden Touch was too nimble for him.He found his mouth full, not of mealy potato, but of solid metal, which so burnt his tongue that he roared aloud, and, jumping up from the table, began to dance and stamp about the room, both with pain and affright."
"“爸爸，亲爱的爸爸！”小玛丽菲尔德喊道，她是个非常关爱别人的孩子，“请问发生了什么事？你烫着嘴了吗？”","“Father, dear father!” cried little Marygold, who was a very affectionate child, “pray what is the matter?Have you burnt your mouth?”"
"“啊，亲爱的孩子，”迈达斯呻吟着，哭丧着脸，“你可怜的父亲也不知道会发生什么事情！”","“Ah, dear child,” groaned Midas, dolefully, “I don’t know what is to become of your poor father!”"
"真的，我亲爱的小家伙们，在你们的生活中，你们曾听说过这么可怜的事情吗？那简直是国王面前摆放的最奢侈的早餐，但它的奢侈使它毫无用处。最穷的劳工坐下来吃面包皮喝杯水都远比迈达斯国王要好得多，他面前摆放的美味佳肴确实值它们变成金子的价钱。然而，那又能怎么样呢？早餐时，迈达斯就已经相当饿了。晚餐时他会感觉好点吗？他该多么想吃晚餐啊，可毫无疑问，那同样是一道道无法下咽的菜，和现在摆放在他面前的一样！想想，一直被供应如此昂贵却不能吃的食物，你能活几天？","And, truly, my dear little folks, did you ever hear of such a pitiable case in all your lives?Here was literally the richest breakfast that could be set before a king, and its very richness made it absolutely good for nothing.The poorest laborer, sitting down to his crust of bread and cup of water, was far better off than King Midas, whose delicate food was really worth its weight in gold.And what was to be done?Already, at breakfast, Midas was excessively hungry.Would he be less so by dinner time?And how ravenous would be his appetite for supper, which must undoubtedly consist of the same sort of indigestible dishes as those now before him!How many days, think you, would he survive a continuance of this rich fare?"
"这些思考不断困扰着聪明的迈达斯国王，终于，他开始怀疑财富是不是世界上他想要的或最值得拥有的东西。然而这仅仅是一闪即逝的念头罢了。迈达斯对闪闪发光的金子非常着迷，他不肯仅仅因为早餐之类微不足道的事情就放弃点金术。想想吧，一顿饭的代价是多么沉重啊！这简直就等于花费数以万计的钱（而且继续计算的话，还得几千几百万元）买几条油煎鲑鱼，一个鸡蛋，一块土豆，一块热糕点和一杯咖啡！","These reflections so troubled wise King Midas, that he began to doubt whether, after all, riches are the one desirable thing in the world, or even the most desirable.But this was only a passing thought.So fascinated was Midas with the glitter of the yellow metal, that he would still have refused to give up the Golden Touch for so paltry a consideration as a breakfast.Just imagine what a price for one meal’s victuals!It would have been the same as paying millions and millions of money (and as many millions more as would take forever to reckon up) for some fried trout, an egg, a potato, a hot cake, and a cup of coffee!"
"“这也太昂贵了吧。”迈达斯想。","“It would be quite too dear,” thought Midas."
"然而，他实在饿得发昏，他的处境又让人为难，不得不痛苦而大声呻吟起来。我们漂亮的玛丽戈尔德可再也无法忍受了。她坐着，看着她爸爸，努力用她的小智慧弄清楚他到底是怎么了。接着，她怀着亲切而悲伤的冲动想要安慰他，她从椅子上站起来，跑向迈达斯，关爱地用她的胳膊抱住了他的膝盖。他弯下身，亲吻她。他感觉到他宝贝女儿的爱比凭借点金术所获得的财富还珍贵无数倍。","Nevertheless, so great was his hunger, and the perplexity of his situation, that he again groaned aloud, and very grievously too.Our pretty Marygold could endure it no longer.She sat, a moment, gazing at her father, and trying, with all the might of her little wits, to find out what was the matter with him.Then, with a sweet and sorrowful impulse to comfort him, she started from her chair, and, running to Midas, threw her arms affectionately about his knees.He bent down and kissed her.He felt that his little daughter’s love was worth a thousand times more than he had gained by the Golden Touch."
"“我最最珍爱的玛丽戈尔德！”他惊叫道。","“My precious, precious Marygold!” cried he."
"然而，玛丽戈尔德没有回答。","But Marygold made no answer."
"天啊，他做了什么？那个陌生人赐予的法术是多么致命啊！迈达斯的嘴唇碰到玛丽戈尔德额头的那一刻，变化就产生了。她温柔、红润的脸蛋，像以前一样充满了关爱，披上一层闪闪发光的金黄色，脸颊上还凝结着金黄的泪珠。她漂亮的棕色长鬓发也同样被染成了金黄色。她柔软温柔的小身体在爸爸的怀抱中变得坚硬而僵化。哦，多么悲惨不幸啊！因为他对财富永无止境的贪欲，小玛丽戈尔德不再是一个真正的孩子，而是一尊金雕像！","Alas, what had he done?How fatal was the gift which the stranger bestowed!The moment the lips of Midas touched Marygold’s forehead, a change had taken place.Her sweet, rosy face, so full of affection as it had been, assumed a glittering yellow color, with yellow tear-drops congealing on her cheeks.Her beautiful brown ringlets took the same tint.Her soft and tender little form grew hard and inflexible within her father’s encircling arms.Oh, terrible misfortune!The victim of his insatiable desire for wealth, little Marygold was a human child no longer, but a golden statue!"
"是的，她就在那里，充满关爱、悲伤和同情的脸上带着疑问，变得僵硬。这是有史以来最感人、最悲惨的一幕了。玛丽戈尔德的面容和特征都在那里，甚至是惹人喜爱的小酒窝也停留在她的金下巴上。但是，越是相似，这位父亲看着这尊金塑像就越难过，这是一个女儿留下的全部东西。每当他格外喜爱玛丽戈尔德的时候，他就会说把她的体重换成金子的话，金子多贵重，玛丽戈尔德就有多珍贵，这曾经是他最喜欢的话。而今这句话真的变成了事实。现在，当这一切太晚了的时候，他才终于感觉到一颗温暖、关心、爱他的心，远远超过了堆在天地之间的巨大财富的价值！","Yes, there she was, with the questioning look of love, grief, and pity, hardened into her face.It was the prettiest and most woeful sight that ever mortal saw.All the features and tokens of Marygold were there; even the beloved little dimple remained in her golden chin.But the more perfect was the resemblance, the greater was the father’s agony at beholding this golden image, which was all that was left him of a daughter.It had been a favorite phrase of Midas, whenever he felt particularly fond of the child, to say that she was worth her weight in gold.And now the phrase had become literally true.And now, at last, when it was too late, he felt how infinitely a warm and tender heart, that loved him, exceeded in value all the wealth that could be piled up betwixt the earth and sky!"
"如果我告诉你们，迈达斯是怎样在自己的贪欲实现时，扭绞着双手，痛苦地呻吟，他多么不能忍受去看玛丽戈尔德，又舍不得不看她，那么这个故事就太令人悲伤了。他只有盯着雕塑才相信她变成了金子。然而，再偷看一眼那尊珍贵的小塑像，金黄色的脸颊上凝结着一滴黄色的泪珠，温柔的面孔如此让人怜悯，那神情看起来似乎定能软化金子，再次让她恢复肉体。然而，这是不可能的。因此，迈达斯不得不扭绞着他的双手，如果他放弃所有的财富就能使他亲爱的女儿恢复哪怕是淡淡玫瑰色的面色，他愿意成为这偌大的世界上最贫穷的人。","It would be too sad a story, if I were to tell you how Midas, in the fullness of all his gratified desires, began to wring his hands and bemoan himself; and how he could neither bear to look at Marygold, nor yet to look away from her.Except when his eyes were fixed on the image, he could not possibly believe that she was changed to gold.But, stealing another glance, there was the precious little figure, with a yellow tear-drop on its yellow cheek, and a look so piteous and tender, that it seemed as if that very expression must needs soften the gold, and make it flesh again.This, however, could not be.So Midas had only to wring his hands, and to wish that he were the poorest man in the wide world, if the loss of all his wealth might bring back the faintest rose-color to his dear child’s face."
"正当他心烦意乱，伤心绝望时，他突然看见一个陌生人站在门旁边。迈达斯低下头，什么都没说，因为他认出那个身影就是昨天出现在藏宝室、还教会他灾难性的本领点金术的那个人。陌生人的脸上仍然带着一丝微笑，那微笑在整个房间都似乎散发出一丝金黄色的亮光，连玛丽戈尔德的雕像和其他被迈达斯触摸而变成金子的物体都被照得光亮耀眼。","While he was in this tumult of despair, he suddenly beheld a stranger standing near the door.Midas bent down his head, without speaking; for he recognized the same figure which had appeared to him, the day before, in the treasure-room, and had bestowed on him this disastrous faculty of the Golden Touch.The stranger’s countenance still wore a smile, which seemed to shed a yellow lustre all about the room, and gleamed on little Marygold’s image, and on the other objects that had been transmuted by the touch of Midas."
"“好了，迈达斯，我的朋友，”陌生人说，“请告诉我点金术的效果怎么样？”","“Well, friend Midas,” said the stranger, “pray how do you succeed with the Golden Touch?”"
"迈达斯摇摇头。","Midas shook his head."
"“我非常痛苦，”他说。","“I am very miserable,” said he."
"“非常痛苦，不会吧！”陌生人惊叫道，“那是怎么回事？难道我没有信守许下的诺言？那不是你内心想要的一切吗？”","“Very miserable, indeed!” exclaimed the stranger.“And how happens that?Have I not faithfully kept my promise with you?Have you not everything that your heart desired?”"
"“金子不是一切，”迈达斯回答，“而且我失去了我内心真正喜爱的一切。”","“Gold is not everything,” answered Midas.“And I have lost all that my heart really cared for.”"
"“啊！那么这就是你从昨天起的新发现？”陌生人说，“让我们来看一看。下面两件东西你认为哪个更值钱——点金术，还是一杯清凉的水？”","“Ah!So you have made a discovery, since yesterday?” observed the stranger.“Let us see, then.Which of these two things do you think is really worth the most,—the gift of the Golden Touch, or one cup of clear cold water?”"
"“啊，神圣的水啊！”迈达斯惊叫道，“它再也不能浸润我干燥的喉咙了！”","“O blessed water!” exclaimed Midas.“It will never moisten my parched throat again!”"
"“点金术，”陌生人继续说，“还是一块面包皮呢？”","“The Golden Touch,” continued the stranger, “or a crust of bread?”"
"“一块面包，”迈达斯回答，“值世界上所有的金子！”","“A piece of bread,” answered Midas, “is worth all the gold on earth!”"
"“点金术，”陌生人问，“还是你一小时前还热情、温柔、惹人喜爱的小人儿玛丽戈尔德呢？”","“The Golden Touch,” asked the stranger, “or your own little Marygold, warm, soft, and loving as she was an hour ago?”"
"“哦，我的孩子，我亲爱的孩子！”可怜的迈达斯叫喊着，扭绞着双手，“我宁愿要她嘴角的小酒窝，也不要能把偌大世界变成一块金子的点金术！”","“Oh, my child, my dear child!” cried poor Midas, wringing his hands.“I would not have given that one small dimple in her chin for the power of changing this whole big earth into a solid lump of gold!”"
"“你比以前明智多了，迈达斯国王！”陌生人说，严肃地看着他，“你的内心，我想，还没有彻底地从血肉变成金子。如果真是那样的话，你的情况就真的到了令人绝望的地步了。但是你好像仍然能领会，那些每个人都能理解的最平凡的事情，比那么多人为之叹息和奋斗的财富还要珍贵。告诉我，现在，你真诚地希望自己摆脱点金术的法力吗？”","“You are wiser than you were, King Midas!” said the stranger, looking seriously at him.“Your own heart, I perceive, has not been entirely changed from flesh to gold.Were it so, your case would indeed be desperate.But you appear to be still capable of understanding that the commonest things, such as lie within everybody’s grasp, are more valuable than the riches which so many mortals sigh and struggle after.Tell me, now, do you sincerely desire to rid yourself of this Golden Touch?”"
"“我实在太讨厌它了！”迈达斯回答。","“It is hateful to me!” replied Midas."
"一只苍蝇落在他的鼻子上，但是马上掉在地上，因为它也变成了金子。迈达斯冷战不已。","A fly settled on his nose, but immediately fell to the floor; for it, too, had become gold.Midas shuddered."
"“那么，去吧，”陌生人说，“跳进那条流经你花园尽头的河里吧。带回一瓶那里的水，洒在任何你想把它从金子变回原形的东西上。如果你诚挚地做这件事，它就可能会修复因你的贪欲而造成的恶果。”","“Go, then,” said the stranger, “and plunge into the river that glides past the bottom of your garden.Take likewise a vase of the same water, and sprinkle it over any object that you may desire to change back again from gold into its former substance.If you do this in earnestness and sincerity, it may possibly repair the mischief which your avarice has occasioned.”"
"迈达斯国王深深地鞠了一躬，当他抬起头的时候，那个耀眼的陌生人已经消失了。","King Midas bowed low; and when he lifted his head, the lustrous stranger had vanished."
"你们完全可以相信，迈达斯马上抓起一个很大的土制陶罐（但是，天哪！当他碰了它之后就不再是土制的了），匆忙地跑到河边。他不停地向前奔跑，硬是从灌木丛中挤了过去，如果你看见他身后的树木是如何纷纷变成金黄色，你一定会为这奇观惊叹不已，仿佛只有那里是秋天，而其他地方不是。一到河边，他就一头扎进去，连鞋都等不及脱。","You will easily believe that Midas lost no time in snatching up a great earthen pitcher (but, alas me! it was no longer earthen after he touched it), and hastening to the river-side.As he scampered along, and forced his way through the shrubbery, it was positively marvelous to see how the foliage turned yellow behind him, as if the autumn had been there, and nowhere else.On reaching the river’s brink, he plunged headlong in, without waiting so much as to pull off his shoes."
"“呼！呼！呼！”迈达斯从水里钻出来，喷了喷鼻息。“哇，这个澡真是让我精神焕发，我想，这水一定把点金术彻底消除了。现在，我要把我的水罐装满！”","“Poof! poof! poof!” snorted King Midas, as his head emerged out of the water.“Well; this is really a refreshing bath, and I think it must have quite washed away the Golden Touch.And now for filling my pitcher!”"
"他把水罐浸到水里时，不由得心里乐开了花，因为他看见水罐正从金罐变回原来的土罐，恢复到他触摸前那优质、真实、土质的模样。他也意识到自己内心起了变化。胸口那块冰冷、坚硬、分量沉重的东西消失了。毫无疑问，他的心曾经渐渐失去了人类心中实质的东西，变成了没有情感和感觉的金属，但现在又开始软化成血肉了。迈达斯看见河边长着一朵紫罗兰花，用手指碰了碰，他惊喜地发现那朵精致的花仍然保留着原来的紫色，并没有枯萎成黄色。看来，点金术的魔咒真正离开他了。","As he dipped the pitcher into the water, it gladdened his very heart to see it change from gold into the same good, honest earthen vessel which it had been before he touched it.He was conscious, also, of a change within himself.A cold, hard, and heavy weight seemed to have gone out of his bosom.No doubt, his heart had been gradually losing its human substance, and transmuting itself into insensible metal, but had now softened back again into flesh.Perceiving a violet, that grew on the bank of the river, Midas touched it with his finger, and was overjoyed to find that the delicate flower retained its purple hue, instead of undergoing a yellow blight.The curse of the Golden Touch had, therefore, really been removed from him."
"迈达斯国王急匆匆地回到宫殿，我猜，仆人们在看见他们高贵的主人如此小心翼翼地把一个装满水的土制陶罐带回宫时，都不知道他要做什么。但是对于迈达斯来说，可以消除因他愚蠢行为造成的所有后果的水远比大量熔金要珍贵得多。他要做的第一件事，不用说你也知道，就是一把一把的把水洒在小玛丽戈尔德的金雕像上。","King Midas hastened back to the palace; and, I suppose, the servants knew not what to make of it when they saw their royal master so carefully bringing home an earthen pitcher of water.But that water, which was to undo all the mischief that his folly had wrought, was more precious to Midas than an ocean of molten gold could have been.The first thing he did, as you need hardly be told, was to sprinkle it by handfuls over the golden figure of little Marygold."
"水一落到她身上，你就会高兴地看到这亲爱的孩子的脸颊如何又恢复了红润！她如何开始打喷嚏又是如何气急败坏——当她发现自己浑身湿淋淋的，而她的爸爸却还在不停往她身上洒更多的水，她是多么地惊讶！","No sooner did it fall on her than you would have laughed to see how the rosy color came back to the dear child’s cheek! and how she began to sneeze and sputter!—and how astonished she was to find herself dripping wet, and her father still throwing more water over her!"
"“请不要洒了，亲爱的爸爸！”她哭喊着，“瞧你把我漂亮的连衣裙弄湿了，我今天早上才穿上的！”","“Pray do not, dear father!” cried she.“See how you have wet my nice frock, which I put on only this morning!”"
"因为玛丽戈尔德还不知道自己曾经变成一尊金雕塑的事，也不记得当她伸出胳膊跑去安慰可怜的迈达斯国王的那一刻起发生的所有事情。","For Marygold did not know that she had been a little golden statue; nor could she remember anything that had happened since the moment when she ran with outstretched arms to comfort poor King Midas."
"他的爸爸认为没有必要告诉他挚爱的孩子他曾经多么愚蠢，但是却很满足现在变得多么明智。为此，他把小玛丽戈尔德领进花园，然后把剩下的水全部洒在玫瑰丛上，结果，五千多朵玫瑰花重现了它们盛开的漂亮花朵。然而，在迈达斯国王活着的时候，有两种情况会使他经常想起点金术。一件是河边像金子般闪闪发光的沙子；另一件是小玛丽戈尔德现在的金黄色头发，在她被他的吻变成金雕塑之前，他还从来没有注意过。不过，这样的变化确实是件好事，因为玛丽戈尔德现在的头发比婴儿期时浓密多了。","Her father did not think it necessary to tell his beloved child how very foolish he had been, but contented himself with showing how much wiser he had now grown.For this purpose, he led little Marygold into the garden, where he sprinkled all the remainder of the water over the rose-bushes, and with such good effect that above five thousand roses recovered their beautiful bloom.There were two circumstances, however, which, as long as he lived, used to put King Midas in mind of the Golden Touch.One was, that the sands of the river sparkled like gold; the other, that little Marygold’s hair had now a golden tinge, which he had never observed in it before she had been transmuted by the effect of his kiss.This change of hue was really an improvement, and made Marygold’s hair richer than in her babyhood."
"当迈达斯国王变成老人的时侯，他经常把玛丽戈尔德的孩子们一个接一个地放在他的膝盖上，他非常喜欢讲这个不同寻常的故事，正如我现在讲给你们的一样。然后，他就会抚摸他们光亮的鬓发，告诉他们，他们的头发就像金子的颜色，这是从他们的妈妈那里遗传的。","When King Midas had grown quite an old man, and used to trot Marygold’s children on his knee, he was fond of telling them this marvelous story, pretty much as I have now told it to you.And then would he stroke their glossy ringlets, and tell them that their hair, likewise, had a rich shade of gold, which they had inherited from their mother."
"“实话告诉你吧，我心爱的小宝贝们，”迈达斯说，同时不时地逗弄他们，“自从那个早晨开始，我看见金色就非常厌恶，但是，你们的头发例外！”","“And to tell you the truth, my precious little folks,” quoth King Midas, diligently trotting the children all the while, “ever since that morning, I have hated the very sight of all other gold, save this!”"
"影子溪——故事讲完以后","Shadow Brook.—After the Story"
"“好了，孩子们，”尤斯塔斯说，他非常喜欢听取观众的意见，“在你们的生活中，你们曾经听过比《点金术》更好听的故事吗？”","“Well, children,” inquired Eustace, who was very fond of eliciting a definite opinion from his auditors, “did you ever, in all your lives, listen to a better story than this of ‘The Golden Touch’?”"
"“怎么会没有呢？迈达斯国王的故事，”调皮的报春花说，“早在尤斯塔斯·布赖特先生出生前一千年就很有名了，而且在尤斯塔斯先生去世千百年后还会名扬四海。但是有些人具有我们所谓的‘点呆术’，手指碰到的一切都会变得沉闷、笨重。”","“Why, as to the story of King Midas,” said saucy Primrose, “it was a famous one thousands of years before Mr. Eustace Bright came into the world, and will continue to be so long after he quits it.But some people have what we may call ‘The Leaden Touch,’ and make everything dull and heavy that they lay their fingers upon.”"
"“你是个聪明的孩子，报春花，一点不像十几岁的样子，”尤斯塔斯说，同时对她辛辣的批评大吃一惊,“但是，你这个小调皮的心里一定知道我把老掉牙的迈达斯点金术的故事进行了全新的加工，使它闪耀着以前从未有过的光芒。还有那个叫玛丽戈尔德的人物！你不认为这里面有点独具匠心吗？我讲得多么娓娓动听，意味深长！香厥木、蒲公英、红花草、长春花，你们说呢？听了这个故事之后，你们是不是有人也傻乎乎地渴望拥有把物品变成金子的能力？”","“You are a smart child, Primrose, to be not yet in your teens,” said Eustace, taken rather aback by the piquancy of her criticism.“But you well know, in your naughty little heart, that I have burnished the old gold of Midas all over anew, and have made it shine as it never shone before.And then that figure of Marygold!Do you perceive no nice workmanship in that?And how finely I have brought out and deepened the moral!What say you, Sweet Fern, Dandelion, Clover, Periwinkle?Would any of you, after hearing this story, be so foolish as to desire the faculty of changing things to gold?”"
"“我真想，”十岁的长春花说，“拥有用右手食指把一切变成金子的能力，如果我不满意，还可以用我的左手食指变回来。而且我知道今天下午，我想要做什么！”","“I should like,” said Periwinkle, a girl of ten, “to have the power of turning everything to gold with my right forefinger; but, with my left forefinger, I should want the power of changing it back again, if the first change did not please me.And I know what I would do, this very afternoon!”"
"“那请你告诉我吧。”尤斯塔斯说。","“Pray tell me,” said Eustace."
"“哦，”长春花回答，“我将用我的左手食指触摸树上的每一片金色叶子，把它们全部变回绿色，这样，我们就可以马上回到夏天了，同时就不会再有令人讨厌的冬天了。”","“Why,” answered Periwinkle, “I would touch every one of these golden leaves on the trees with my left forefinger, and make them all green again; so that we might have the summer back at once, with no ugly winter in the mean time.”"
"“哦，长春花！”尤斯塔斯·布赖特说，“那你可就错了，而且还会做出许多恶作剧。如果我是迈达斯，我就其他什么事都不做，只全年不停地变金子。我的好点子总是姗姗来迟。为什么我不告诉你们迈达斯几岁来到美国，并把和其他国家一样灰暗的秋天变得像这里一样绚丽多彩呢？他把大自然的每一片叶子都变得金子般闪闪发光。”","“O Periwinkle!” cried Eustace Bright, “there you are wrong, and would do a great deal of mischief.Were I Midas, I would make nothing else but just such golden days as these over and over again, all the year throughout.My best thoughts always come a little too late.Why did not I tell you how old King Midas came to America, and changed the dusky autumn, such as it is in other countries, into the burnished beauty which it here puts on?He gilded the leaves of the great volume of Nature.”"
"“尤斯塔斯表哥，”香厥木说，他是个不错的小男孩，而且尤其爱问巨人和小仙子的具体身高和大小，“玛丽戈尔德有多高？她变成金子后有多重”？","“Cousin Eustace,” said Sweet Fern, a good little boy, who was always making particular inquiries about the precise height of giants and the littleness of fairies, “how big was Marygold, and how much did she weigh after she was turned to gold?”"
"“她和你差不多高，”尤斯塔斯回答，“而且，因为金子很重，她至少有两千磅重，而且可能已经被铸成三万或四万金元了。希望报春花值她的一半。来，小伙伴们，让我们爬出这个山谷，看看周围的景色吧。”","“She was about as tall as you are,” replied Eustace, “and, as gold is very heavy, she weighed at least two thousand pounds, and might have been coined into thirty or forty thousand gold dollars.I wish Primrose were worth half as much.Come, little people, let us clamber out of the dell, and look about us.”"
"然后，他们就爬出了山谷。太阳的位置显示现在是午后一两点，西边的阳光照耀着山谷的巨大凹处，似乎在里面注满了柔和的光芒，并洒在周围的山坡上，仿佛碗里溢出金黄色的美酒。天气如此之好，你都会忍不住说：“从来没有过这么美好的一天！”虽然昨天也是这样的一天，明天也不会有什么差别。啊，然而一年十二月的轮回中，这样的日子非常少！这是十月份所独有的特质，每一天好像都占据着巨大的空间，尽管这个季节太阳很晚才升起，并且像小孩子睡觉那样，在六点钟人还很清醒的时候或更早的时候就下山了。因此，我不能说白天很长，但是不管以哪种方式，它们似乎要用它们的广阔来弥补其短暂；当凉爽的夜晚来临的时候，我们感觉到从早晨开始，就已经享受了十分美好的时光。","They did so.The sun was now an hour or two beyond its noontide mark, and filled the great hollow of the valley with its western radiance, so that it seemed to be brimming with mellow light, and to spill it over the surrounding hill-sides, like golden wine out of a bowl.It was such a day that you could not help saying of it, “There never was such a day before!” although yesterday was just such a day, and to-morrow will be just such another.Ah, but there are very few of them in a twelvemonth’s circle!It is a remarkable peculiarity of these October days, that each of them seems to occupy a great deal of space, although the sun rises rather tardily at that season of the year, and goes to bed, as little children ought, at sober six o’clock, or even earlier.We cannot, therefore, call the days long; but they appear, somehow or other, to make up for their shortness by their breadth; and when the cool night comes, we are conscious of having enjoyed a big armful of life, since morning."
"“快来啊，孩子们，快来！”尤斯塔斯·布赖特喊道，“再多捡点坚果，多捡点，再多点！装满你们所有的篮子，圣诞节我会给你们砸碎，再给你们讲好听的故事！”","“Come, children, come!” cried Eustace Bright.“More nuts, more nuts, more nuts!Fill all your baskets; and, at Christmas time, I will crack them for you, and tell you beautiful stories!”"
"于是，他们离开了，个个都兴致高昂，除了小蒲公英，我很难过地告诉你们，他刚才坐在了一个带刺的栗子上，全身扎满了刺，像一个针垫似的。天哪，他一定感到很不舒服！","So away they went; all of them in excellent spirits, except little Dandelion, who, I am sorry to tell you, had been sitting on a chestnut-bur, and was stuck as full as a pincushion of its prickles.Dear me, how uncomfortably he must have felt!"
