"驴和哈巴狗","The Ass and the Lapdog "
"一个人养了一头驴和一条长得非常漂亮的马耳他哈巴狗。驴被丢在栏舍里，有充足的燕麦和干草可以吃，就像其他驴一样。哈巴狗会耍很多把戏，深得主人喜爱。主人经常爱抚它，几乎每次出去吃饭都会给它捎回一些好吃的。然而，驴要干很多活，要拉磨磨玉米面，要从森林驮木材或是从农场驮重物回来。它经常哀叹自己命苦，老拿自己的命运和哈巴狗的奢侈、懒惰进行对比。终于有一天，它挣断了缰绳，飞奔到主人的房子里，肆无忌惮地乱踢蹄子，活蹦乱跳地尽力讨好主人。然后，驴效仿之前看到的哈巴狗的做法，在主人身边跳来跳去。但它却弄坏了餐桌，把餐桌上所有的盘子都打得粉碎。接着，驴试图舔它的主人，跳到他的背上。仆人们听到奇怪的吵闹声，发现主人有危险，连忙赶过去救他，并对驴棍棒相加，把它赶回了栏舍。当驴回到栏舍时，已经快被打死了，便哀叹道：“我这都是自讨苦吃啊！为什么我不满足于和其他伙伴们一起干活，却想要像那条没用的小哈巴狗一样整天无所事事啊！”","A man had an Ass, and a Maltese Lapdog, a very great beauty.The Ass was left in a stable and had plenty of oats and hay to eat, just as any other Ass would.The Lapdog knew many tricks and was a great favorite with his master, who often fondled him and seldom went out to dine without bringing him home some tidbit to eat.The Ass, on the contrary, had much work to do, in grinding the corn-mill, and in carrying wood from the forest, or burdens from the farm.He often lamented his own hard fate and contrasted it with the luxury and idleness of the Lapdog, till at last one day he broke his cords and halter, and galloped into his master’s house, kicking up his heels without measure, and frisking and fawning as well as he could.He next tried to jump about his master as he had seen the Lapdog do, but he broke the table and smashed all the dishes upon it to atoms.He then attempted to lick his master, and jumped upon his back.The servants, hearing the strange hubbub and perceiving the danger of their master, quickly relieved him, and drove out the Ass to his stable with kicks and clubs and cuffs.The Ass, as he returned to his stall beaten nearly to death, thus lamented: “I have brought it all on myself!Why could I not have been contented to labor with my companions, and not wish to be idle all the day like that useless little Lapdog!”"

"一位老妇人失明了，请来医生给她治眼睛。她在证人面前和医生达成协议：如果医生治好了她的失明，他将从她那儿得到一笔钱，但如果她还是看不见，她就什么都不用给他。协议达成后，医生一次次来给老妇人的眼睛上药膏。每次上门他都拿走一些东西，就这样一点点地偷走了老妇人的所有家当。等医生把老妇人的东西都拿走后，他治好了老妇人的眼睛，并向她索要之前允诺的报酬。重获光明的老妇人看到家中空无一物，便什么也不愿给他。医生坚持要自己的酬劳，老妇人还是不给，于是医生将她告到法官那里。老妇人站在法庭上辩解道：“这个人说的话是属实的，我的确答应过他，自己若重获光明会给他一笔钱，但如果我还是看不见，我就什么都不用给他。现在他宣称将我的眼疾治好了。可是正相反，我敢肯定我依然看不见，因为我失明前还看到屋子里有各种财物和值钱的东西，但现在，虽然他发誓说已经治好了我的失明，可我还是一件东西都看不见。”","An Old Woman having lost the use of her eyes, called in a Physician to heal them, and made this bargain with him in the presence of witnesses: that if he should cure her blindness, he should receive from her a sum of money; but if her infirmity remained, she should give him nothing.This agreement being made, the Physician, time after time, applied his salve to her eyes, and on every visit took something away, stealing all her property little by little.And when he had got all she had, he healed her and demanded the promised payment.The Old Woman, when she recovered her sight and saw none of her goods in her house, would give him nothing.The Physician insisted on his claim, and as she still refused, summoned her before the Judge.The Old Woman, standing up in the Court, argued: “This man here speaks the truth in what he says; for I did promise to give him a sum of money if I should recover my sight: but if I continued blind, I was to give him nothing.Now he declares that I am healed.I on the contrary affirm that I am still blind; for when I lost the use of my eyes, I saw in my house various chattels and valuable goods; but now, though he swears I am cured of my blindness, I am not able to see a single thing in it.”"
"斗鸡和老鹰","The Fighting Cocks and the Eagle "
"两只斗鸡为了争夺农家庭院的控制权而正在恶战。最后，其中一只让另一只落败而逃。那只斗败的公鸡偷偷躲了起来，藏在一个安静的角落里，而那只胜利的公鸡则拍打着翅膀，飞上一座高墙，得意洋洋地放开嗓门打起鸣来。一只掠过天空的老鹰突然猛扑向这只公鸡，用利爪将其捉走了。那只战败的公鸡立刻从角落里跑了出来，从此毫无争议地控制了庭院。","Two game cocks were fiercely fighting for the mastery of the farmyard.One at last put the other to flight.The vanquished Cock skulked away and hid himself in a quiet corner, while the conqueror, flying up to a high wall, flapped his wings and crowed exultingly with all his might.An Eagle sailing through the air pounced upon him and carried him off in his talons.The vanquished Cock immediately came out of his corner, and ruled henceforth with undisputed mastery."
"骄兵必败。","Pride goes before destruction."
"战马和磨坊主","The Charger and the Miller "
"一匹战马年迈体弱，便被送到了一个磨坊里去干活，不再奔赴战场。但是，当这匹战马因不能再上战场而被迫去拉磨时，它又为自己命运的改变而深感悲哀。回想起昔日的身份地位，它说道：“啊！磨坊主啊，我的确曾亲历战场，全副武装，身边还有一个随从负责照料我，可现在，我不明白，到底是什么使我痛苦地放弃战场而选择了磨坊。”“够了，”磨坊主对马说道，“别再唠叨过去的事了，忍受命运的起伏是所有生物的共同命运。”","A Charger, feeling the infirmities of age, was sent to work in a mill instead of going out to battle.But when he was compelled to grind instead of serving in the wars, he bewailed his change of fortune and called to mind his former state, saying, “Ah! Miller, I had indeed to go campaigning before, but I was barbed from counter to tail, and a man went along to groom me; and now I cannot understand what ailed me to prefer the mill before the battle.”“Forbear,” said the Miller to him, “harping on what was of  yore, for it is the common lot of mortals to sustain the ups and downs of fortune.”"
"狐狸和猴子","The Fox and the Monkey "
"一只猴子在一次百兽集会上跳舞，他的表演令全场大为欢喜，于是被选为国王。有一只狐狸嫉妒猴子取得的荣誉，她发现一个陷阱里有一片肉，于是她将猴子带到那儿，说她发现了一个藏宝洞，不过还没动过。她一直为猴子留着，好做他王国的无价之宝，还劝猴子要据为己有。猴子一时大意，便走了过去，结果掉进了陷阱。当猴子大骂狐狸故意引他掉进陷阱时，狐狸答道：“哦，猴子，就凭你这种头脑也配当百兽之王吗？”","A Monkey once danced in an assembly of the Beasts, and so pleased them all by his performance that they elected him their King.A Fox, envying him the honor, discovered a piece of meat lying in a trap, and leading the Monkey to the place where it was, said that she had found a store, but had not used it, she had kept it for him as treasure trove of his kingdom, and counseled him to lay hold of it.The Monkey approached carelessly and was caught in the trap; and on his accusing the Fox of purposely leading him into the snare, she replied, “O Monkey, and are you, with such a mind as yours, going to be King over the Beasts?”"
"马和它的主人","The Horse and His Rider "
"一个骑兵悉心照料着他的战马。只要战争持续，他就把战马视为一切危急情况下的助手，于是他用干草和谷物精心喂养着战马。但等战争结束了，他就只给它喂糟糠，还让它驮沉重的木材，强迫它做很多卑微的苦差事，不好好待它。然而，战争又爆发了，号角声声，唤他上阵。士兵为战马穿上军用马饰，自己也穿上了厚重的甲胄，然后纵身跃上马背。重压之下，马儿立刻就倒了下去，它再也承担不起这样的重量了。马对主人说：“现在你必须得徒步上战场了，因为你已经把我从一匹马变成了一头驴；你怎么能指望我一下子就从一头驴又变回一匹马呢？”","A horse soldier took the utmost pains with his charger.As long as the war lasted, he looked upon him as his fellow helper in all emergencies and fed him carefully with hay and corn.But when the war was over, he only allowed him chaff to eat and made him carry heavy loads of wood, subjecting him to much slavish drudgery and ill-treatment.War was again proclaimed, however, and when the trumpet summoned him to his standard, the Soldier put on his charger its military trappings, and mounted, being clad in his heavy coat of mail.The Horse fell down straightway under the weight, no longer equal to the burden, and said to his master, “You must now go to the war on foot, for you have transformed me from a Horse into an Ass; and how can you expect that I can again turn in a moment from an Ass to a Horse?”"
"胃和其他器官","The Belly and the Members "
"身体的其他器官共同刁难起胃来，抱怨道：“凭什么总是我们忙着帮助你满足需要，而你却什么也不做，在奢侈和自我放纵中独享其乐呢？”于是，器官们就下定决心拒绝再帮助胃。很快，整个身体都变得虚弱无力。手、脚、嘴和眼睛对他们的愚蠢做法感到后悔，可却为时已晚了。","The Members of the Body rebelled against the Belly, and said, “Why should we be perpetually engaged in administering to your wants, while you do nothing but take your rest, and enjoy yourself in luxury and self-indulgence?”The Members carried out their resolve and refused their assistance to the Belly.The whole Body quickly became debilitated, and the hands, feet, mouth, and eyes, when too late, repented of their folly."
