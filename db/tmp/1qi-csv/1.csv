"你知道我为什么告诉你这些鸡毛蒜皮的事吗？我是想让你明白，从一开始，在我还是个害羞胆小的孩子的时候，你的个性就对我产生了如此大的影响。在我真正见到你之前，你的头上就笼罩着一个光环。一种富贵、奇异而又神秘的气氛围绕着你。生活在狭小天地里的人总是很渴望新鲜事儿的。我们这幢郊区小楼房里的所有居民都急不可耐地等你搬进来。就我自己而言，当我有一天下午放学回到家，看见搬家具的车停在楼前时，我对你的好奇心简直到了狂热的地步。当时大部分笨重的家具都已搬到楼上了，搬运工正在搬一些小物件。我站在门口，艳羡地看着，因为你所有的东西与我熟知的东西是那么地不一样。你有印度的佛像，意大利的雕塑，色彩艳丽的大幅绘画。最后是书，这些书非常精致，其数量之多，远超出我的想象。这些书都堆在门口。你的仆人站在那儿，仔细地一本本拭去书上的灰尘。我贪婪地看着那越来越高的书堆。你的仆人没有把我撵走，但也没叫我走近，因此我一本书也不敢碰，尽管我心里很想摸一摸那些书光滑的软皮封面。我只是怯生生地看了看一些书名，有好些是法文和英文写的，还有些文字我一个字都不认得。我本想一直站在那儿看上几个小时的，可我的母亲叫我，我只得回去了。 ","Do you know why I am telling you these trifles?I want you to understand how it was that from the very beginning your personality came to exercise so much power over me when I was still a shy and timid child.Before I had actually seen you, there was a halo round your head.You were enveloped in an atmosphere of wealth, marvel, and mystery.People whose lives are narrow, are avid of novelty; and in this little suburban house we were all impatiently awaiting your arrival.In my own case, curiosity rose to fever point when I came home from school one afternoon and found the furniture van in front of the house.Most of the heavy things had gone up, and the furniture removers were dealing with the smaller articles.I stood at the door to watch and admire, for everything belonging to you was so different from what I had been used to.There were Indian idols, Italian sculptures, and great, brightly coloured pictures.Last of all came books, such lovely books, many more than I should have thought possible.They were piled by the door.The manservant stood there carefully dusting them one by one.I greedily watched the pile as it grew.Your servant did not send me away, but he did not encourage me either, so I was afraid to touch any of them, though I should have so liked to stroke the smooth leather bindings.I did glance timidly at some of the titles; many of them were in French and in English, and in languages of which I did not know a single word.I should have liked to stand there watching for hours, but my mother called me and I had to go in."
"我整个晚上都在想你，尽管我那时还没见过你。我自己只有十几本很便宜的书，都是用旧纸板做的封面。我爱护这些书，胜过世上其他任何东西，而且一直把这些书读了又读。那时我就想一个有这么多的书，读过这么多的书，懂这么多种语言，有钱又有学问的人会是什么样子呢？想到这么多的书，我心里就生起一种异常的崇敬之情。我努力在心中描绘你的模样。你一定是个戴眼镜的老先生，蓄着长长的白胡子，就像我们的地理老师一样，但是比他更和气、更好看、更温雅。我不知道为什么我就认定你长得好看，因为我那时把你想象成一位老者。就在那天夜里，我第一次梦见了你。 ","I thought about you the whole evening, although I had not seen you yet.I had only about a dozen cheap books, bound in worn cardboard.I loved them more than anything else in the world, and was continually reading and rereading them.Now I was wondering what the man could be like who had such a lot of books, who had read so much, who knew so many languages, who was rich and at the same time so learned.The idea of so many books aroused a kind of unearthly veneration.I tried to picture you in my mind.You must be an old man with spectacles and a long, white beard, like our geography master, but much kinder, nicer-looking, and gentler.I don’t know why I was sure that you must be handsome, for I fancied you to be an elderly man.That very night, I dreamed of you for the first time."
"第二天你搬进来了，可是尽管我一直在留意着，我还是没能见到你，这也进一步激发了我的好奇。最后，在你搬进来的第三天，我终于见到你了。当我发现你与我幼稚想象中那个古代教父的形象完全不同时，我真是大吃了一惊。我原以为会见到一个戴眼镜的和蔼可亲的老人，可是你出现了，样子就跟你现在看起来一样，因为你是那种岁月几乎不会在身上留下什么痕迹的人。你穿着一身漂亮的浅褐色斜纹软呢服，一步跨两级台阶地跑上楼，步伐中带着你那种一贯的孩童般的轻捷。你把帽子拿在手里，所以我看到了你那容光焕发、朝气蓬勃的面孔，还有那一头年轻亮泽的头发，当时我真是惊讶得难以形容。你面容俊朗、身材颀长、英俊潇洒，这着实让我吃了一惊。真是奇怪，就在我初次见到你的那一刻，我就非常清楚地感觉到了你一直令我和其他所有人都惊讶的特质。我意识到你是一个具有双重人格的人：一方面你是一个热情洋溢、乐观快活的年轻人，喜欢运动和探险；同时你又是在你所从事的领域里学识渊博、很有休养、严肃认真、极具责任心的学者。无意中我感觉到了每个认识你的人对你的印象：你过着一种双重生活。一种是众所周知的，向世人敞开的生活；另外一种则是远离俗世，只有你自己真正了解的生活。我，这个着了魔似的被你吸引住的十三岁女孩，在看到你的第一眼时，就感觉到了你的秘密，即这种深藏着的分裂的双重生活。","Next day you moved in; but though I was on the watch I could not get a glimpse of your face, and my failure inflamed my curiosity.At length I saw you, on the third day.How astounded I was to find that you were quite different from the ancient godfather conjured up by my childish imagination.A bespectacled, good-natured old fellow was what I had expected to see; and you came, looking just as you still look, for you are one on whom the years leave little mark.You were wearing a beautiful suit of light-brown tweeds, and you ran upstairs two steps at a time with the boyish ease that always characterises your movements.You were hat in hand, so that, with indescribable amazement, I could see your bright and lively face and your youthful hair.Your handsome, slim, and spruce figure was a positive shock to me.How strange it was that in this first moment I should have plainly realised that which I and all others are continually surprised at in you.I realised that you are two people rolled into one: that you are an ardent, light-hearted youth, devoted to sport and adventure; and at the same time, in your art, a deeply read and highly cultured man, grave, and with a keen sense of responsibility.Unconsciously I perceived what everyone who knew you came to perceive, that you led two lives.One of these was known to all, it was the life open to the whole world; the other was turned away from the world, and was fully known only to yourself.I, a girl of thirteen, coming under the spell of your attraction, grasped this secret of your existence, this profound cleavage of your two lives, at the first glance."
"你现在能明白，你对我这个孩子来说是一个多么大的奇迹，一个多么诱人的谜吗？这是一位人们谈起时都会心怀敬意的人，因为他写了很多书，因为他在上流社会赫赫有名。可是突然之间，呈现在我面前的是个还带着一丝孩子气，开朗活泼的二十五岁青年！不必说，自此以后，在我狭小的生活天地里，你是我唯一的兴趣；带着十三岁女孩的执着，我整个生活都围着你打转。我观察你，观察你的生活习惯，观察那些来找你的人——所有这一切不仅没有减弱，反而增强了我对你这个人的兴趣，因为来访的有各种各样的人，这就表现出了你性格中的两重性。他们当中有些是年轻人，你的朋友伙伴，一批不修边幅的学生，你跟他们一起谈笑嬉闹。有些是坐小汽车过来的女士。有一次歌剧院的指挥家——这位我以前只能远远看着的、手拿指挥棒的大人物——也来拜访你。还有些是还在上商校的年轻女孩子，她们常常是羞涩地从大门溜进去。你的访客中有很多都是女人。但我对此并没有什么别的想法，即使是当有一天早上，我在上学路上看见有位用面纱遮得严严实实的女士从你屋里出来时，我也没有多想。我那时才十三岁，还没有长大，压根儿没有意识到那种窥探你一切举动的强烈好奇心已经是爱了。","Can you understand, now, what a miracle, what an alluring enigma, you must have seemed to me, the child?Here was a man whom everyone spoke of with respect because he wrote books, and because he was famous in the great world.Of a sudden he had revealed himself to me as a boyish, cheerful young man of five-and-twenty!I need hardly tell you that henceforward, in my restricted world, you were the only thing that interested me; that my life revolved round yours with the fidelity proper to a girl of thirteen.I watched you, watched your habits, watched the people who came to see you—and all this increased instead of diminishing my interest in your personality, for the two-sidedness of your nature was reflected in the diversity of your visitors.Some of them were young men, comrades of yours, carelessly dressed students with whom you laughed and larked.Some of them were ladies who came in motors.Once the conductor of the opera—the great man whom before this I had seen only from a distance, baton in hand—called on you.Some of them were girls, young girls still attending the commercial school, who shyly glided in at the door.A great many of your visitors were women.I thought nothing of this, not even when, one morning, as I was on my way to school, I saw a closely veiled lady coming away from your flat.I was only just thirteen, and in my immaturity I did not in the least realise that the eager curiosity with which I scanned all your doings was already love."
"但我知道我确定将自己整颗心交给你的那一天那一刻。那天，我和一个同学去散了会儿步，然后我俩站在大门口聊天。一辆小汽车驶了过来。你急匆匆地、快速地从车上跳了出来，这个样子至今仍使我动心，然后你马上就要进门去了。有一种冲动让我去给你开门，这样我就挡了你的路，以至于我俩几乎撞在了一起。你看了我一眼，眼光热忱、亲切、饱含了许多内容，就像是一种爱怜一般。你温柔地对我微微一笑——是的，是温柔地笑——然后温和地，不，是亲密地对我说：“非常感谢。”","But I know the very day and hour when I consciously gave my whole heart to you.I had been for a walk with a schoolfellow, and we were standing at the door chattering.A motor drove up.You jumped out, in the impatient, springy fashion which has never ceased to charm me, and were about to go in.An impulse made me open the door for you, and this brought me in your path, so that we almost collided.You looked at me with a cordial, gracious, all-embracing glance, which was almost a caress.You smiled at me tenderly—yes, tenderly, is the word—and said gently, nay, confidentially: “Thanks so much.”"
"你所说的就只有这句话。可是从那一刻，从你如此温柔、如此多情地看着我的那一刻起，我就是你的了。后来，实际上就在不久之后，我知道对于和你有所接触的所有女人，你都是以这种目光看她们的。这是一种情意绵绵、充满诱惑的目光，顷刻间使人沉迷其中，为之神魂颠倒，这是一个天生的诱惑者的目光。你对每一个为你服务的歌舞女演员，每一个给你开门的侍女都会不自觉地投以这样的目光。你并不是有意想要占有所有这些女人，但你对异性与生俱来的热情使你一看见女人，眼光便不由自主地变得温暖动人起来。可十三岁的我没有想到这些，我觉得心里好像有团火在燃烧。我认为你的柔情就是给我的，只是给我的。而就在这一瞬间，我这个尚未长大的女孩子一下子成为了一个女人，一个在未来的日子里都会属于你的女人。 ","That was all you said.But from this moment, from the time when you looked at me so gently, so tenderly, I was yours.Later, before long indeed, I was to learn that this was a way you had of looking at all women with whom you came in contact.It was a caressing and alluring glance, at once enfolding and disclothing, the glance of the born seducer.Involuntarily, you looked in this way at every showgirl who served you, at every maidservant who opened the door to you.It was not that you consciously longed to possess all these women, but your impulse towards the sex unconsciously made your eyes melting and warm whenever they rested on a woman.At thirteen, I had no thought of this; and I felt as if I had been bathed in fire.I believed that the tenderness was for me, for me only; and in this one instant the woman was awakened in the half-grown girl, the woman who was to be yours for all future time."
"“那是谁啊？”我朋友问道。一开始我答不出来。我发现自己无法将你的名字说出口。你的名字突然间在我心中变得神圣无比，成了我的秘密。“哦，就是住在我们楼里的一个人。”我有些局促不安地说道。“那当他看着你的时候，你的脸为什么这么红啊？”我同学有一丝恶意地好奇地问道。我感觉她是在捉弄我，而且刚好触到了我的秘密，我的脸颊顿时涨得比任何时候都红。我故意对她粗鲁起来：“你这个蠢丫头！”我生气地说——我真想把她掐死。她嘲讽地大笑起来，我无可奈何，气愤不已，泪水在眼眶里打转。我把她一个人扔在门口，自己跑上楼去了。 ","“Who was that?” asked my friend.At first, I could not answer.I found it impossible to utter your name.It had suddenly become sacred to me, had become my secret.“Oh, it’s just someone who lives in the house,” I said awkwardly.“Then why did you blush so fiery red when he looked at you?” enquired my schoolfellow with the malice of an inquisitive child.I felt that she was making fun of me, and was reaching out towards my secret, and this coloured my cheeks more than ever.I was deliberately rude to her: “You silly idiot,” I said angrily—I should have liked to throttle her.She laughed mockingly, until the tears came into my eyes from impotent rage.I left her at the door and ran upstairs."
"从那时起，我就爱上了你。我完全清楚，你已经习惯了听女人们说爱你。但我确定没有人像我这么卑微地爱着你，这么死心塌地、全身心地爱你，过去是这样，现在也是这样。没有什么东西能比得上一个孩子那不为人所觉察的爱。因为这种爱渺无希望，卑微低下；矢志不渝，炽烈深厚。这是成年妇女那种贪得无厌、不经意间苛求无度的爱永远无法比拟的。唯有孤独的孩子才能珍视这样的感情。其他人会在社交往来中挥霍自己的感情，在和人喁喁私谈中将感情宣泄殆尽。他们听说过、也读到过许多与爱情有关的事，他们知道，每个人都会遭遇爱情。他们就像玩弄一件玩具一般玩弄爱情；他们就像男孩子炫耀自己抽的第一支香烟一般炫耀爱情。可我没有知己朋友，没有人教我、也没人提醒我，我毫无经验，也没有任何顾虑。我一头栽进了我命运的深渊。一切让我激动的事，一切发生在我身上的事，似乎都围绕着你，围绕着我对你的想象。我的父亲早已去世。我的母亲只会想着她那些烦心琐事，想着靠她那微薄的养老金难以维持生活，除此以外什么都不会想，这样她和我这个成长中的少女也几乎没什么共同语言。我的那些同学很多事情半懂不懂，且多少有些变坏，我与她们素不投机，因为她们总是轻浮地看待我心中那种至高无上的激情。结果，我心中激涌的一切情感，那种所有我这个年龄的少女通常怀有的散乱情愫都集中到了你身上。对我而言，你就是——用什么样的比喻才能形容我的感受呢？你成为了我的整个生命。对我来说，除了目前尚和你有关的所有事物之外，一切都是不存在的。一切事情只有因你而生才会对我有意义。你改变了我的一切。我以前一直对学习没多大兴趣，成绩平平。现在突然之间，我一跃成为全班第一。我一本接一本地读书，常常读到深夜，因为我知道你是一个爱书的人。让我母亲不胜惊讶的是，我开始近乎固执地练起了钢琴，因为我猜想你是喜爱音乐的。我把我的衣服缝了又缝，就为了在你面前显得干净整洁。我那条旧的校服罩裙（拿我母亲的一件旧罩衫改的）上面有个正方形补丁，这使我苦恼不已。我怕你会注意到这个补丁，会看不起我，因此我上楼梯时总是用书包遮着那个补丁。我很害怕你会看见那个补丁。我真是傻啊！你在那次以后几乎就再也没有看过我。 ","I have loved you ever since.I know full well that you are used to hearing women say that they love you.But I am sure that no one else has ever loved you so slavishly, with such doglike fidelity, with such devotion, as I did and do.Nothing can equal the unnoticed love of a child.It is hopeless and subservient; it is patient and passionate; it is something which the covetous love of a grown woman, the love that is unconsciously exacting, can never be.None but lonely children can cherish such a passion.The others will squander their feelings in companionship, will dissipate them in confidential talks.They have heard and read much of love, and they know that it comes to all.They play with it like a toy; they flaunt it as a boy flaunts his first cigarette.But I had no confidant; I had been neither taught nor warned; I was inexperienced and unsuspecting.I rushed to meet my fate.Everything that stirred in me, all that happened to me, seemed to be centred upon you, upon my imaginings of you.My father had died long before.My mother could think of nothing but her troubles, of the difficulties of making ends meet upon her narrow pension, so that she had little in common with the growing girl.My schoolfellows, half-enlightened and half-corrupted, were uncongenial to me because of their frivolous outlook upon that which to me was a supreme passion.The upshot was that everything which surged up in me, all which in other girls of my age is usually scattered, was focussed upon you.You became for me—what simile can do justice to my feelings?You became for me the whole of my life.Nothing existed for me except in so far as it related to you.Nothing had meaning for me unless it bore upon you in some way.You had changed everything for me.Hitherto I had been indifferent at school, and undistinguished.Now, of a sudden, I was the first.I read book upon book, far into the night, for I knew that you were a book-lover.To my mother’s astonishment, I began, almost stubbornly, to practise the piano, for I fancied that you were fond of music.I stitched and mended my clothes, to make them neat for your eyes.It was a torment to me that there was a square patch in my old school-apron (cut down from one of my mother’s overalls).I was afraid you might notice it and would despise me, so I used to cover the patch with my satchel when I was on the staircase.I was terrified lest you should catch sight of it.What a fool I was!You hardly ever looked at me again."
"而我整天都等着你，关注着你。在我家前门上有一个小小的窥视孔，透过这个小孔可以看到你的房门。别嘲笑我啊，亲爱的。即使到现在，我也没有为我在这个窥视孔旁花费的时间感到羞愧。走廊冷冰冰的，我总是怕引起母亲的疑心。但在那些年月里，我整下午整下午地坐在那里等候着你，手里拿着本书，心绷得像根琴弦，你一走近，就颤动不已。我每每走近你，心都会紧张，可是你并没有察觉到，就像你不会察觉到你口袋里手表上紧的发条一样，这根发条忠诚地为你记录着钟点，追随着你的脚步，但你却听不到它的滴答声。也许在成百万秒中你只匆匆瞥了它一眼。我知道一切与你有关的事，你的生活习惯，你戴的领带，我也熟悉你的每一套衣服。不久我还熟悉了那些经常来拜访你的人，并且把他们分成我喜欢的和讨厌的两种类型。从十三岁到十六岁，我的每一小时都是属于你的。我还有什么傻事没干过啊？我亲吻过你摸过的门把手，捡起过你扔掉的香烟头，将其看得神圣无比，因为你的嘴唇碰触过它。晚上我上百次地找这样或那样的借口跑上街，就为了看你哪间屋里还亮着灯，这样我虽然看不到你，却也能更充分地感觉到你的存在。你出门的那几周（每每看见约翰把你的旅行皮箱提下楼时，我的心似乎就会停止跳动），生活对我来说就失去了意义。我抑郁烦闷、百无聊赖、情绪恶劣，四处徘徊不知道做些什么，并且还得十分小心，免得我母亲从我哭肿的双眼中看出我的绝望。 ","Yet my whole day was spent in waiting for you and watching you.There was a judas in our front door, and through this a glimpse of your door could be had.Don’t laugh at me, dear.Even now, I am not ashamed of the hours I spent at this spy-hole.The hall was icy cold, and I was always afraid of exciting my mother’s suspicions.But there I would watch through the long afternoons, during those months and years, book in hand, tense as a violin string, and vibrating at the touch of your nearness.I was ever near you, and ever tense; but you were no more aware of it than you were aware of the tension of the mainspring of the watch in your pocket, faithfully recording the hours for you, accompanying your footsteps with its unheard ticking, and vouchsafed only a hasty glance for one second among millions.I knew all about you, your habits, the neckties you wore; I knew each one of your suits.Soon I was familiar with your regular visitors, and had my likes and dislikes among them.From my thirteenth to my sixteenth year, my every hour was yours.What follies did I not commit?I kissed the door-handle you had touched; I picked up a cigarette end you had thrown away, and it was sacred to me because your lips had pressed it.A hundred times, in the evening, on one pretext or another, I ran out into the street in order to see in which room your light was burning, that I might be more fully conscious of your invisible presence.During the weeks when you were away (my heart always seemed to stop beating when I saw John carry your portmanteau downstairs), life was devoid of meaning.Out of sorts, bored to death, and in an ill-humour, I wandered about not knowing what to do, and had to take precautions lest my tear-stained eyes should betray my despair to my mother."
"我知道，我现在写下的都是些荒唐可笑的事儿，是一个少女奢侈的幻想。我应该为这些事感到害臊，可是我并不为此感到害臊，因为我的爱从来没有像那个时候那么纯洁和炽烈过。我可以花上几个小时，甚至几天的时间告诉你我当时是如何和你一起生活的，尽管你几乎没见过我的面。你自然是不知道我的，因为每当我在楼梯上遇见你，无法避开的时候，由于我害怕看到你那火辣辣的目光，我往往会低头从你身边迅速跑开，快得就像一个人怕被火烧着而跳进水里一样。我可以花上几个小时，甚至几天的时间跟你说说那些你早已忘却的日子，将你以前生活的每一天展现在你面前：可是我不想用这些繁杂细节来烦你。我只想再告诉你一件发生在那个时候的事，这是我童年时代最美好的经历。你可不要为此而嘲笑我，因为尽管你可能认为这只是微不足道的小事，但对我却有非常重要的意义。","I know that what I am writing here is a record of grotesque absurdities, of a girl’s extravagant fantasies.I ought to be ashamed of them; but I am not ashamed, for never was my love purer and more passionate than at this time.I could spend hours, days, in telling you how I lived with you though you hardly knew me by sight.Of course you hardly knew me, for if I met you on the stairs and could not avoid the encounter, I would hasten by with lowered head, afraid of your burning glance, hasten like one who is jumping into the water to avoid being singed.For hours, days, I could tell you of those years you have long since forgotten; could unroll all the calendar of your life: but I will not weary you with details.Only one more thing I should like to tell you dating from this time, the most splendid experience of my childhood.You must not laugh at it, for, trifle though you may deem it, to me it was of infinite significance."
"那应该是个星期天。你出门去了，你的仆人正在把已经拍打干净的厚重地毯从开着的房门拖回屋去。这些地毯对他来说太多太重了，我鼓起勇气过去问他要不要我帮他一把。他很惊讶，但没有拒绝。我能够让你明白我是怀着怎样一种敬畏和虔诚崇拜之情跨进你的寓所吗？怀着这样的心情，我看到了你的天地——你过去常用的书桌（桌上有些鲜花插在一个蓝色的水晶花瓶里），还有一些画和书籍。我只是偷偷地望了一眼，尽管倘若我壮着胆子向约翰要求，善良的他必定会让我看得更仔细些。可是就这一眼也足以使我感受到你那儿的气氛，这为我提供了新的营养，让我无论醒着还是睡着都能永无止境地梦见你。 ","It must have been a Sunday.You were away, and your man was dragging back the heavy rugs, which he had been beating, through the open door of the flat.They were rather too much for his strength, and I summoned up courage to ask whether he would let me help him.He was surprised, but did not refuse.Can I ever make you understand the awe, the pious veneration, with which I set foot in your dwelling, with which I saw your world—the writing-table at which you were accustomed to sit (there were some flowers on it in a blue crystal vase), the pictures, the books?I had no more than a stolen glance, though the good John would no doubt have let me see more had I ventured to ask him.But it was enough for me to absorb the atmosphere, and to provide fresh nourishment for my endless dreams of you in waking and sleeping."
"这匆匆的一分钟是我童年最幸福的时刻。我想把这个时刻告诉你，这样你这个不认识我的人最终就能够明白我的生活是如何与你的生活联系在一起的。我想将这一刻告诉你，也要将接下来那可怕的时刻告诉你。就像我跟你解释过的那样，我时时想着你，为此我对任何其他的事都不在意。我不在意我母亲在做什么，也不留意任何一个到我们家来的访客。我没有注意到，有个上了年纪的先生，一个因斯布鲁克的商人，也是我母亲的一个远房亲戚经常到我家来，并且会呆上很长一段时间。我很高兴他有时会带我母亲去看戏，因为这样我就可以一个人呆在家里，不受打扰地想你，不受打扰地窥探你，这是我最大的、也是唯一的快乐。但是有一天我母亲一副郑重其事的样子把我叫过去，说有些正事要和我谈谈。我的脸一下变得苍白，我感觉到我的心怦怦直跳。她猜到什么了吗？我在什么地方露出马脚了吗？我首先想到的是你，是我的秘密，是将我和生命联系在一起的秘密。可是我母亲自己却有些不好意思。她以前从来不会亲吻我的。但当时她却不止一次地温柔地吻我，把我拉到沙发上挨着她坐下，然后犹犹豫豫、扭扭捏捏地说，她的亲戚死了妻子，现在向她求婚，而她，主要因为我的缘故，决定接受他的求婚。我心跳得厉害，焦虑万分，心里只想着你。“那咱们还住这儿，是吗？”我结结巴巴地问道。“不，我们要搬到因斯布鲁克去，费迪南德在那儿有座漂亮的别墅。”我再也听不进别的话了。我感觉眼前一片漆黑。后来我知道自己当时晕过去了。我猛地握紧双手，像铅块似的摔倒在地。我无法告诉你在接下来的那几天里所发生的一切，我，一个软弱无力的孩子，如何能够与强势的大人对抗啊。即使是现在，我想到这些时，手还会抖得下不了笔。我又不能泄露我真正的秘密，因此我的反抗看起来就只是耍性子、闹别扭。没人告诉我更多的事。一切都背着我安排好了。他们利用我上学的时间安排搬家事宜。每次我放学回家都有些新东西被搬走或者被卖掉了。我的生活似乎碎成了一片片的，最终，有一天我回家吃饭时，搬运工人已经把家里所有的东西都搬走了。在空空的房间里放着整理好的箱子，还有给我和母亲准备的两张折叠床。我们还要在这儿过一夜，然后到因斯布鲁克去。 ","This swift minute was the happiest of my childhood.I wanted to tell you of it, so that you who do not know me might at length begin to understand how my life hung upon yours.I wanted to tell you of that minute, and also of the dreadful hour which so soon followed.As I have explained, my thoughts of you had made me oblivious to all else.I paid no attention to my mother’s doings, or to those of any of our visitors.I failed to notice that an elderly gentleman, an Innsbruck merchant, a distant family connexion of my mother, came often and stayed for a long time.I was glad that he took Mother to the theatre sometimes, for this left me alone, undisturbed in my thoughts of you, undisturbed in the watching which was my chief, my only pleasure.But one day my mother summoned me with a certain formality, saying that she had something serious to talk to me about.I turned pale, and felt my heart throb.Did she suspect anything?Had I betrayed myself in some way?My first thought was of you, of my secret, of that which linked me with life.But my mother was herself embarrassed.It had never been her way to kiss me.Now she kissed me affectionately more than once, drew me to her on the sofa, and began hesitatingly and rather shamefacedly to tell me that her relative, who was a widower, had made her a proposal of marriage, and that, mainly for my sake, she had decided to accept.I palpitated with anxiety, having only one thought, that of you.“We shall stay here, shan’t we?” I stammered out.“No, we are going to Innsbruck, where Ferdinand has a fine villa.”I heard no more.Everything seemed to turn black before my eyes.I learned afterwards that I had fainted.I clasped my hands convulsively, and fell like a lump of lead.I cannot tell you all that happened in the next few days; how I, a powerless child, vainly revolted against the mighty elders.Even now, as I think of it, my hand shakes so that I can hardly write.I could not disclose the real secret, and therefore my opposition seemed ill-tempered obstinacy.No one told me anything more.All the arrangements were made behind my back.The hours when I was at school were turned to account.Each time I came home some new article had been removed or sold.My life seemed falling to pieces; and at last one day, when I returned to dinner, the furniture removers had cleared the flat.In the empty rooms there were some packed trunks, and two camp-beds for Mother and myself.We were to sleep there one night more, and were then to go to Innsbruck."
"在这最后一天我突然明白，不在你身边，我是无法活下去的。你是我的整个世界。我说不清楚我当时是怎么想的，也说不清楚在那绝望的时刻我是否还能清醒地思考。我母亲不在家。我站起来，就像往常那样，穿着校服，向你家门口走去。但我不能说是走过去的。我四肢僵硬，关节发抖，似乎是一块磁铁把我吸到了你的门前。我想跪伏在你的脚下，求你收留我做你的女仆，做你的奴隶。我不禁开始担心，怕你会对一个十五岁少女的这种痴狂迷恋感到好笑。可是如果你能理解我是如何站在冰冷刺骨的楼道上，担心得浑身僵硬，但仍然被一股难以抗拒的力量驱使着朝前走，还有我的双臂如何不受控制地举起来时，你就不会笑我了。这场斗争看似只持续了几秒钟，但却像是永无止境一般可怕，然后我按响了门铃。刺耳的铃声至今仍在我耳边回响。接下来是一片寂静，在我凝神听你是否会来开门时，我的心脏几乎停止了跳动，血液也几乎凝固了。","On this last day I suddenly made up my mind that I could not live without being near you.You were all the world to me.I can hardly say what I was thinking of, and whether in this hour of despair I was able to think at all.My mother was out of the house.I stood up, just as I was, in my school dress, and went over to your door.Yet I can hardly say that I went.With stiff limbs and trembling joints, I seemed to be drawn towards your door as by a magnet.It was in my mind to throw myself at your feet, and to beg you to keep me as a maid, as a slave.I cannot help feeling afraid that you will laugh at this infatuation of a girl of fifteen.But you would not laugh if you could realise how I stood there on the chilly landing, rigid with apprehension, and yet drawn onward by an irresistible force; how my arm seemed to lift itself in spite of me.The struggle appeared to last for endless, terrible seconds; and then I rang the bell.The shrill noise still sounds in my ears.It was followed by a silence in which my heart well-nigh stopped beating, and my blood stagnated, while I listened for your coming."
"可你没有来开门。没有任何人来开门。那天下午你一定是不在家，约翰也一定是出去了。暗沉的门铃声还在我耳际回响，我悄悄回到我们空荡荡的寓所，精疲力竭地倒在地毯上，从你家门到我家一共四步路，我却觉得犹如在深深的雪地里跋涉了几个小时那样疲惫。可即使精疲力竭，我也要在他们把我带走之前看你一眼，和你说说话的决心依然不减。我向你保证，我脑子里没有一丝情欲的念头。我那时还什么都不懂，因为除了你我什么都不会去想。我只想再见你一面，只想紧紧地抱着你。在那可怕的夜晚，我一直等候着你。我母亲刚一躺下睡着，我就悄悄地溜到客厅听你什么时候回来。一月份的夜晚冷得要命。我疲乏困倦，四肢酸疼，客厅里已经没有椅子可坐，我就躺在地板上，忍受着从门底透进来的寒风。我穿着单薄的裙子躺在那儿，身上什么也没盖。我不想让自己暖和，害怕暖和了就会睡着，错过你的脚步声。我浑身抽搐，这个可怕的黑夜实在是太冷了，我不得不一次又一次地站起来。可是我依然等着，等着，等着你，犹如等待我的命运一般。 ","But you did not come.No one came.You must have been out that afternoon, and John must have been away too.With the dead note of the bell still sounding in my ears, I stole back into our empty dwelling, and threw myself exhausted upon a rug, tired out by the four steps as if I had been wading through deep snow for hours.Yet beneath this exhaustion there still glowed the determination to see you, to speak to you, before they carried me away.I can assure you that there were no sensual longings in my mind; I was still ignorant, just because I never thought of anything but you.All I wanted was to see you once more, to cling to you.Throughout that dreadful night I waited for you.Directly my mother had gone to sleep, I crept into the hall to listen for your return.It was a bitterly cold night in January.I was tired, my limbs ached, and there was no longer a chair on which I could sit; so I lay upon the floor, in the draught that came under the door.In my thin dress I lay there, without any covering.I did not want to be warm, lest I should fall asleep and miss your footstep.Cramps seized me, so cold was it in the horrible darkness; again and again I had to stand up.But I waited, waited, waited for you, as for my fate."
"终于（大概在凌晨两三点钟吧）我听见大门打开了，然后是上楼的脚步声。寒意顿时消退了，一股热流涌遍我的全身。我轻轻地打开房门，想冲出去扑倒在你的脚下……我不知道疯狂的我会干出什么事来。脚步声越来越近。烛光忽隐忽现。我颤抖地握着门把手。是你上楼来了吗？","At length (it must have been two or three in the morning) I heard the house-door open, and footsteps on the stair.The sense of cold vanished, and a rush of heat passed over me.I softly opened the door, meaning to run out, to throw myself at your feet....I cannot tell what I should have done in my frenzy.The steps drew nearer.A candle flickered.Tremblingly I held the door-handle.Was it you coming up the stairs?"
"是的，是你，亲爱的，可是你不是一个人。我听到一声温柔的笑声，绸衣拖地的窸窣声和你低声说话的声音。有个女人和你在一起……","Yes, it was you, beloved; but you were not alone.I heard a gentle laugh, the rustle of silk, and your voice, speaking in low tones.There was a woman with you...."
"我不知道那一夜余下的时间里我是怎么熬过来的。第二天早上八点他们把我带到因斯布鲁克去了。我已经没有力气反抗了。","I cannot tell how I lived through the rest of the night.At eight next morning, they took me with them to Innsbruck.I had no strength left to resist."
"我的儿子昨天夜里死了。如果我真的得继续活下去的话，我又要孤零零一个人了。明天那些身穿黑衣、粗鲁的陌生男人会来，会带口棺材来裝殓我这唯一的孩子。也许朋友们也会来送些花圈——可是棺材上的花有什么用呢？他们会说上几句话安慰我。话、话、话！这些话有什么用呢？我只是知道我又要孤零零一个人了。没有什么比置身于人群却又孤独一人更可怕的了。那是我在因斯布鲁克那漫长的两年里所体会到的。从十六岁到十八岁的那两年，我像个囚犯、像个流浪者一样生活在我的家人中间。我的继父是一个安静的、沉默寡言的人，他对我很好。我母亲，似乎急于弥补一个无意中犯下的过错，总想着满足我的一切愿望。和我同龄的那些人也乐意和我交朋友。可是我用愤怒和蔑视拒绝他们的亲近。离开了你，我不愿意快乐，不愿意心满意足地生活，因此我将自己埋藏在我那阴郁沉闷、孤独寂寥的小天地里，自己折磨自己。我不穿他们给我买的那些艳丽的新衣服。我拒绝去听音乐会，拒绝去看戏，我也不愿跟人一起高高兴兴地去远足郊游。我几乎足不出户。如果我告诉你在这个我住了两年的小城市，我认识的街道还不到十条，你会相信吗？忧伤愁苦是我的乐趣。我拒绝社会，拒绝任何的快乐，见不到你，我便压制自己的一切欲望，沉迷其中，以此为乐。而且，我不会让任何事情分我的心，影响我那只为你而活的强烈渴望。我一个人坐在家里，一坐几小时，一坐一整天，什么也不做，只是想你，在心中反反复复地回味那些对你的琐碎记忆，重温每次见你、等你的情景，脑子就像剧院似的，将这些小插曲排演了一遍又一遍。我把自你进入我生活那天开始的童年时光在脑中重复了无数次，一切细节都在我记忆中刻下了深深的烙印，所以我可以回想起过去那些年里的每一分钟，一切仿佛就发生在昨天一样。","My boy died last night.I shall be alone once more, if I really have to go on living.Tomorrow, strange men will come, black-clad and uncouth, bringing with them a coffin for the body of my only child.Perhaps friends will come as well, with wreaths—but what is the use of flowers on a coffin?They will offer consolation in one phrase or another.Words, words, words!What can words help?All I know is that I shall be alone again.There is nothing more terrible than to be alone among human beings.That is what I came to realise during those interminable two years in Innsbruck, from my sixteenth to my eighteenth year, when I lived with my people as a prisoner and an outcast.My stepfather, a quiet, taciturn man, was kind to me.My mother, as if eager to atone for an unwitting injustice, seemed ready to meet all my wishes.Those of my own age would have been glad to befriend me.But I repelled their advances with angry defiance.I did not wish to be happy, I did not wish to live content away from you; so I buried myself in a gloomy world of self torment and solitude.I would not wear the new and gay dresses they bought for me.I refused to go to concerts or to the theatre, and I would not take part in cheerful excursions.I rarely left the house.Can you believe me when I tell you that I hardly got to know a dozen streets in this little town where I lived for two years?Mourning was my joy; I renounced society and every pleasure, and was intoxicated with delight at the mortifications I thus superadded to the lack of seeing you.Moreover, I would let nothing divert me from my passionate longing to live only for you.Sitting alone at home, hour after hour and day after day, I did nothing but think of you, turning over in my mind unceasingly my hundred petty memories of you, renewing every movement and every time of waiting, rehearsing these episodes in the theatre of my mind.The countless repetitions of the years of my childhood from the day in which you came into my life have so branded the details on my memory that I can recall every minute of those long-passed years as if they had been but yesterday."
"这样我的生活仍然是完全围绕着你。我买了所有你写的书。只要你的名字出现在报纸上，这天就成了我的节日。如果我告诉你我把你的书读了一遍又一遍，甚至都能够背下来了，你会相信吗？如果有人在半夜把我从睡梦中唤醒，从你的书里抽出一句话念给我，即使相隔十三年，我今天还能马上接着将整段话流利地背出来。你写的每一个字对我来说都是圣典、箴言。整个世界对我而言只因为与你有关才存在。我在维也纳的报纸上查看音乐会和各种戏剧首演的报道，想着哪些是你最感兴趣的。到了晚上，我想象着自己陪在你身边，我对自己说：“现在他正走入剧院大厅，现在他坐了下来。”我这样想象过上千次，只是因为我曾经有一次在音乐会上看到过你。 ","Thus my life was still entirely centred in you.I bought all your books.If your name was mentioned in the newspaper, the day was a red-letter day.Will you believe me when I tell you that I have read your books so often that I know them by heart?Were anyone to wake me in the night and quote a detached sentence, I could continue the passage unfalteringly even today, after thirteen years.Your every word was Holy Writ to me.The world existed for me only in relationship to you.In the Viennese newspapers I read the reports of concerts and first nights, wondering which would interest you most.When evening came, I accompanied you in imagination, saying to myself: “Now he is entering the hall; now he is taking his seat.”Such were my fancies a thousand times, simply because I had once seen you at a concert."
"我为什么要讲述这些事呢？为什么要讲述一个被抛弃的孩子的悲哀和绝望呢？为什么要把这些告诉你呢？告诉你这个做梦都不会想到我的崇拜与悲伤的人呢？可我还是个孩子吗？我到了十七岁，然后是十八岁，年轻人在大街上都会扭过头来看我，但他们只能让我生气。我完全不可能爱除你之外的任何人，哪怕是随意地在脑子里想也不不可能，以至于对其他男子稍有好感对我而言似乎也是种犯罪。我对你的感情依旧强烈，只不过随着身体的发育和情欲的觉醒有了些变化，变得更加炽烈，生理上的欲望更强，而且明显更像成熟女人的爱情。当年隐藏在那个懵懂小孩和那个按你门铃的少女心里的东西现在成了我唯一的渴望。我想把自己给你。","Why should I recount these things?Why recount the tragic hopelessness of a forsaken child?Why tell it to you, who have never dreamed of my admiration or of my sorrow?But was I still a child?I was seventeen; I was eighteen; young fellows would turn to look after me in the street, but they only made me angry.To love anyone but you, even to play with the thought of loving anyone but you, would have been so utterly impossible to me, that the mere tender of affection on the part of another man seemed to me a crime.My passion for you remained just as intense, but it changed in character as my body grew and my senses awakened, becoming more ardent, more physical, more unmistakably the love of a grown woman.What had been hidden from the thoughts of the uninstructed child, of the girl who had rung your door bell, was now my only longing.I wanted to give myself to you."
"和我来往的人认为我羞涩怯弱。但我有一个始终如一、坚定不移的目标。我一心只想着一件事：回到维也纳，回到你的身边。经过抗争，我得以成功实现自己的心愿，尽管这在别人看来似乎是荒谬无理、不可理解的。我的继父很有钱，而且把我视为他的亲生女儿。可是我坚持要自己挣钱养活自己，最后我得到他同意回到维也纳，在他一个亲戚的服装公司找了个工作。","My associates believed me to be shy and timid.But I had an absolute fixity of purpose.My whole being was directed towards one end—back to Vienna, back to you.I fought successfully to get my own way, unreasonable, incomprehensible, though it seemed to others.My stepfather was well-to-do, and looked upon me as his daughter.I insisted, however, that I would earn my own living, and at length got him to agree to my returning to Vienna as employee in a dressmaking establishment belonging to a relative of his."
"在那个雾气迷濛的秋日傍晚，我终于，终于回到维也纳了，还需要我告诉你我到维也纳之后的第一站是去哪儿吗？我把箱子放在车站行李寄存处，匆匆跳上了一辆电车。这辆车开得好慢啊！","Need I tell you whither my steps first led me that foggy autumn evening when, at last, at last, I found myself back in Vienna?I left my trunk in the cloakroom, and hurried to a tram.How slowly it moved!"
"车每停一站都让我恼火。最后，我来到了那栋楼前。看到你的窗户还亮着灯，我的心雀跃不已。这座城市，这座对我来说已经如此陌生、如此沉闷的城市突然变得鲜活起来。我自己也重获了新生，因为我走近了你，我永恒的梦想。当你和我那抬头仰望的双眼之间仅隔一方薄薄的、闪亮的玻璃时，我可以忽略这样一个事实，那就是现实当中我离你的心是如此遥远，好像远隔千山万水。这足以使我继续凝望着你的窗户了。里面亮着灯，那是你住的房子，你在那儿， 那是我的世界。两年来我一直梦想着这一时刻，现在终于盼到了。在那个温暖的、夜雾弥漫的晚上，我站在你的窗下，直到灯光熄灭。然后我才去寻找自己的住处。","Every stop was a renewed vexation to me.In the end, I reached the house.My heart leapt when I saw a light in your window.The town, which had seemed so alien, so dreary, grew suddenly alive for me.I myself lived once more, now that I was near you, you who were my unending dream.When nothing but the thin, shining pane of glass was between you and my uplifted eyes, I could ignore the fact that in reality I was as far from your mind as if I had been separated by mountains and valleys and rivers.Enough that I could go on looking at your window.There was a light in it; that was your dwelling; you were there; that was my world.For two years I had dreamed of this hour, and now it had come.Throughout that warm and cloudy evening I stood in front of your windows, until the light was extinguished.Not until then did I seek my own quarters."
"每天晚上我都会回到这个地方。我在公司里工作到六点。工作很辛苦，但我很喜欢，因为展厅里的忙乱可以掩盖我内心的躁动。公司里的百叶窗一落下，我就飞奔到我心爱的地方。再看你一眼，只见你一面，这是我所有的心愿。我只想远远凝望你的脸！一周之后，我终于见到了你，这次碰面是我没有预料到的，我正凝望着你的窗口，你突然穿过马路走了过来。我一下子又变成了个孩子，那个十三岁的女孩儿。我双颊变得通红。尽管我渴望看到你的眼睛，但我却低下头，飞快地从你身边跑了过去，就像有人在身后追赶我一般。事后我为自己像个女学生似的逃跑了感到羞愧，因为现在我已经知道我真正想要的是什么了。我想遇见你，经过这令我煎熬的几年后，我希望你认出我，注意到我，爱上我。 ","Evening after evening I returned to the same spot.Up to six o’clock I was at work.The work was hard, and yet I liked it, for the turmoil of the show-room masked the turmoil in my heart.The instant the shutters were rolled down, I flew to the beloved spot.To see you once more, to meet you just once, was all I wanted; simply from a distance to devour your face with my eyes.At length, after a week, I did meet you, and then the meeting took me by surprise, I was watching your window, when you came across the street.In an instant, I was a child once more, the girl of thirteen.My cheeks flushed.Although I was longing to meet your eyes, I hung my head and hurried past you as if someone had been in pursuit.Afterwards I was ashamed of having fled like a schoolgirl, for now I knew what I really wanted.I wanted to meet you; I wanted you to recognise me after all these weary years, to notice me, to love me."
"你好长一段时间都没有注意到我，尽管我每天晚上都像站岗一样在你家门外站着，即使下着大雪，或者维也纳冬天的寒风呼啸的时候，我依然如此。有时候我是白白等了几个小时。不过经常到最后你会和朋友一起从家里出来。有两次我看见你和一个女人在一起，看见一个陌生女人亲昵地和你挽臂而行时，我的心突然一阵刺痛，这让我意识到我对你的感情中有了些新的不同的东西。我并不感到惊讶，因为我从童年时期起就知道有很多这样的女人来你家找你。但现在看到这些却引起了我肉体上的痛苦。看到你和另一个女人公然表现出肉体上的亲密，我心里五味杂陈，又有渴望又有憎恨。出于一种幼稚的自尊心，这种自尊我也许到了现在仍无法摆脱，我一整天没有像往常那样到你的住处去，可是这个反抗和放弃的空虚夜晚是多么可怕呀！第二天晚上我就又站在那儿了，像往常一样卑微地站在你的窗前等着，一如我以前在你封闭的生活面前等着你一样。 ","For a long time you failed to notice me, although I took up my post outside your house every night, even when it was snowing, or when the keen wind of the Viennese winter was blowing.Sometimes I waited for hours in vain.Often, in the end, you would leave the house in the company of friends.Twice I saw you with a woman, and the fact that I was now awakened, that there was something new and different in my feeling towards you, was disclosed by the sudden heart-pang when I saw a strange woman walking confidently with you arm-in-arm.It was no surprise to me, for I had known since childhood how many such visitors came to your house; but now the sight aroused in me a definite bodily pain.I had a mingled feeling of enmity and desire when I witnessed this open manifestation of fleshly intimacy with another woman.For a day, animated by the youthful pride from which, perhaps, I am not yet free, I abstained from my usual visit; but how horrible was this empty evening of defiance and renunciation!The next night I was standing, as usual, in all humility, in front of your window; waiting, as I have ever waited, in front of your closed life."
"最后你终于注意到我了。我看见你远远地走来，赶忙振作精神，让自己不要躲开你。凑巧的是，有辆装满货物的卡车停在街上，所以你只得紧挨着我走过去。不经意间，你的双眼看了我一下，尽管你几乎没有注意到我目光中的专注，你脸上也立刻出现了那种你一直以来看女人的神情。往事涌出，我如遭电击——那种饱含爱怜、充满诱惑的目光，即刻间使人沉迷其中，为之失魂。几年前，你用这种目光将我这个女孩子唤醒，使我变成了女人，陷入爱情的女人。你的目光就这样在我身上停留了一、两秒钟，因为空间狭小，我也无法把我的目光移开，接着你走过去了。我的心跳得好厉害，这使我不得不放慢脚步。受到一种难以抑制的好奇心的驱使，我回头望了一眼，我看见你正站在那里看着我。你那好奇探究的神情让我确信你并没有认出我来。你没有认出我，那时没有，后来也没有。我该怎么形容我的失望呢？","At length came the hour when you noticed me.I marked your coining from a distance, and collected all my forces to prevent myself shrinking out of your path.As chance would have it, a loaded dray filled the street, so that you had to pass quite close to me.Involuntarily your eyes encountered my figure, and immediately, though you had hardly noticed the attentiveness in my gaze, there came into your face that expression with which you were wont to look at women.The memory of it darted through me like an electric shock—that caressing and alluring glance, at once enfolding and disclothing, with which, years before, you had awakened the girl to become the woman and the lover.For a moment or two your eyes thus rested on me, for a space during which I could not turn my own eyes away, and then you had passed.My heart was beating so furiously that I had to slacken my pace; and when, moved by irresistible curiosity, I turned to look back, I saw that you were standing and watching me.The inquisitive interest of your expression convinced me that you had not recognised me.You did not recognise me, either then or later.How can I describe my disappointment?"
"这是我第一次这么失望：第一次我不得不忍受我一直以来的命运，那就是你永远不会认出我的。我直到死也不会被你认出来的。唉，我怎么才能让你理解我这种失望呢？在因斯布鲁克的那几年，我从来没停止过对你的思念。我一直在想象着我们在维也纳再次相会的情景。我的想象随我情绪的变化而变化，从最荒唐的种种可能到最圆满的幸福。每一种可能的情形都在我大脑中出现过。心情抑郁时我觉得你会厌恶我，会看不起我，因为我微不足道、平凡无奇，或是因为我的纠缠令人讨厌。我想过你的厌恶、冷酷、淡漠所表现出来的种种可能的形式。可是在我极度抑郁、极端自轻自贱的时候，我也从来没有想过这种最可怕的可能性——那就是你从来没有意识到我的存在。现在我懂了（你教我的！）一个少女或一个女人的脸对于一个男人来说一定是变化多端的。因为它通常只是人情绪的反映，这种反映会像镜子中的影像一样转瞬即逝。男人很容易忘记一个女人的长相，因为女人会改变它的光影和轮廓，在不同时候穿的服饰又会将其衬托成不同的样子。经历多了，女人也就接受了这个事实。可是我那时还是个少女，还不能理解你的健忘。自从第一次知道你，我就全身心地想着你，这使我产生了错觉，觉得你一定也在常常想着我，等候着我。如果我早已知道自己在你心目中什么也不是，在你的记忆中没有一点位置，我怎么能活得下去啊。你那晚的目光告诉我，你的生活和我的生活之间连细如蛛丝的联系都没有，这让我第一次跌落到现实之中，让我第一次预感到了我的命运。 ","This was the first of such disappointments: the first time I had to endure what has always been my fate; that you have never recognised me.I must die, unrecognised.Ah, how can I make you understand my disappointment?During the years at Innsbruck I had never ceased to think of you.Our next meeting in Vienna was always in my thoughts.My fancies varied with my mood, ranging from the wildest possibilities to the most delightful.Every conceivable variation had passed through my mind.In gloomy moments it had seemed to me that you would repulse me, would despise me, for being of no account, for being plain, or importunate.I had had a vision of every possible form of disfavour, coldness, or indifference.But never, in the extremity of depression, in the utmost realisation of my own unimportance, had I conceived this most abhorrent of possibilities—that you had never become aware of my existence.I understand now (you have taught me!) that a girl’s or a woman’s face must be for a man something extraordinarily mutable.It is usually nothing more than the reflexion of moods which pass as readily as an image vanishes from a mirror.A man can readily forget a woman’s face, because she modifies its lights and shades, and because at different times the dress gives it so different a setting.Resignation comes to a woman as her knowledge grows.But I, who was still a girl, was unable to understand your forgetfulness.My whole mind had been full of you ever since I had first known you, and this had produced in me the illusion that you must have often thought of me and waited for me.How could I have borne to go on living had I realised that I was nothing to you, that I had no place in your memory.Your glance that evening, showing me as it did that on your side there was not even a gossamer thread connecting your life with mine, meant for me a first plunge into reality, conveyed to me the first intimation of my destiny."
"你没有认出我来。两天后我们在路上再次相遇时，你用一种亲密的神情看着我，这并不是因为你认出了我是那个爱了你很久、被你唤醒成为女人的少女，而只是因为你认出一张两天前在同一个地方遇见的十八岁美丽女子的脸。你的表情温和而又略带惊讶，嘴角还泛起一丝微笑。你像以前一样从我身边走过，像以前一样又马上放慢脚步。我浑身颤栗，心中雀跃不已，我渴望你能开口跟我说话。我第一次感觉到自己因为你而重获新生，我也放慢了脚步，不想躲开你。突然我听到后面传来你的脚步声。不用回头我也知道我就要听到你那令人喜爱的声音直接和我说话了。这种期待使我几乎浑身酥软，我的心跳得太厉害，所以我觉得自己不得不停下脚步。你来到我身边。你热情地向我打招呼，就好像我们是老朋友似的——尽管你并不是真的认识我，尽管你对我的生活一无所知。你跟我说话的方式是那么率直而迷人，我可以毫不犹豫地回应你的话。我们一起沿街而行，你问我是否愿意和你一起共进晚餐。我同意了。我怎么会拒绝你呢？","You did not recognise me.Two days later, when our paths again crossed, and you looked at me with an approach to intimacy, it was not in recognition of the girl who had loved you so long and whom you had awakened to womanhood; it was simply that you knew the face of the pretty lass of eighteen whom you had encountered at the same spot two evenings before.Your expression was one of friendly surprise, and a smile fluttered about your lips.You passed me as before, and as before you promptly slackened your pace.I trembled, I exulted, I longed for you to speak to me.I felt that for the first time I had become alive for you; I, too, walked slowly, and did not attempt to evade you.Suddenly, I heard your step behind me.Without turning round, I knew that I was about to hear your beloved voice directly addressing me.I was almost paralysed by the expectation, and my heart beat so violently that I thought I should have to stand still.You were at my side.You greeted me cordially, as if we were old acquaintances—though you did not really know me, though you have never known anything about my life.So simple and charming was your manner that I was able to answer you without hesitation.We walked along the street, and you asked me whether we could not have supper together.I agreed.What was there I could have refused you?"
"我们在一家小餐厅里吃了饭。你是不会记得那家餐厅在哪里的。你有过很多次这样的晚餐，对你而言，这只是其中的一次罢了。我算什么呢？不过是几百个女人中的一个，一次猎艳，你无数艳遇中的一个。那天晚上发生了什么事会让你记住我呢？我几乎没怎么说话，因为在你身边，听你对我说话我就已经幸福至极了。我不愿因为几个问题或几句蠢话而浪费哪怕是一秒的时间。我会永远感激你给予我的那一刻，感激你让我觉得自己对你炽烈的仰慕之情是值得的。我永远也不会忘记你温文尔雅的举止。你并没有表现得过于殷勤，也没有急切地示爱。但是即使在这之前我没有倾心于你，你从一开始表现出的亲切友好也会赢得我的心。我能让你明白这对我有多么大的意义吗？我五年的期盼如此完美地得以实现了呀！ ","We supped in a little restaurant.You will not remember where it was.To you it will be one of many such.For what was I?One among hundreds; one adventure, one link in an endless chain.What happened that evening to keep me in your memory?I said very little, for I was so intensely happy to have you near me and to hear you speak to me.I did not wish to waste a moment upon questions or foolish words.I shall never cease to be thankful to you for that hour, for the way in which you justified my ardent admiration.I shall never forget the gentle tact you displayed.There was no undue eagerness, no hasty offer of a caress.Yet from the first moment you displayed so much friendly confidence that you would have won me even if my whole being had not long ere this been yours.Can I make you understand how much it meant to me that my five years of expectation were so perfectly fulfilled?"
"天色已晚，我们离开了餐厅。在餐厅门口，你问我是否忙着回家，是否还有时间。我是属于你的，这点我怎么会瞒着你呢！我说我有的是时间。你迟疑片刻，然后问我是否愿意到你家去坐一会儿，聊聊天。“非常乐意。”我欣然答道，如此直白地表露出了自己的感觉。我不可能没注意到我的欣然答应让你感到惊讶。我不确定你是感到气恼还是高兴，但很明显你吃了一惊。当然，现在我明白了为什么你感到惊讶。我现在才知道，一个女人即使是热切地想把自己献给一个男人，通常也要装出勉勉强强的样子，假装惊慌失措或者气愤羞恼。她一定要等到男人再三哀求，说出一通虚假的甜言蜜语，山盟海誓之后才会同意。我知道，只有职业娼妓才习惯于一口答应这样的邀请——要么是妓女，要么就是天真纯朴、还没有长大成人的女孩子。你怎么会知道，就我而言，如此直白的答应只不过是我长久以来的渴望的吐露，是持续了一千多个日子的思慕的迸涌。","The hour grew late, and we came away from the restaurant.At the door you asked me whether I was in any hurry, or still had time to spare.How could I hide from you that I was yours?I said I had plenty of time.With a momentary hesitation, you asked me whether I would not come to your rooms for a talk.“I shall be delighted,” I answered with alacrity, thus giving frank expression to my feelings.I could not fail to notice that my ready assent surprised you.I am not sure whether your feeling was one of vexation or pleasure, but it was obvious to me that you were surprised.Today, of course, I understand your astonishment.I know now that it is usual for a woman, even though she may ardently desire to give herself to a man, to feign reluctance, to simulate alarm or indignation.She must be brought to consent by urgent pleading, by lies, adjurations, and promises.I know that only professional prostitutes are accustomed to answer such an invitation with a perfectly frank assent—prostitutes, or simple-minded, immature girls.How could you know that, in my case, the frank assent was but the voicing of an eternity of desire, the uprush of yearnings that had endured for a thousand days and more?"
"不管怎样，我的反应引起了你的注意，你对我开始感兴趣了。我们一起往前走的时候，我发现在我们的谈话当中，你总是在以某种方式试探我。你的观察，你对人类种种情感的准确把握使你立刻意识到这个温顺可人的美丽女子身上有些不同寻常的东西，有着一个秘密。","In any case, my manner aroused your attention; I had become interesting to you.As we were walking along together, I felt that during our conversation you were trying to sample me in some way.Your perceptions, your assured touch in the whole gamut of human emotions, made you realise instantly that there was something unusual here; that this pretty, complaisant girl carried a secret about with her."
"你好奇心大发，你那些旁敲侧击的问题表明你想要探听出这个秘密。可我总是躲闪着回应。我宁可在你面前表现得像个傻姑娘，也不愿向你泄露我的秘密。","Your curiosity had been awakened, and your discreet questions showed that you were trying to pluck the heart out of my mystery.But my replies were evasive.I would rather seem a fool than disclose my secret to you."
"我们上楼来到你的寓所。原谅我，亲爱的，原谅我说你是不可能明白和你一起走上这些台阶对我来说意味着什么——我是多么的疯狂，多么的痛苦，快乐到几乎窒息。直到如今，我一想起这一切还禁不住会热泪盈眶，可是我已经没有眼泪可流了。那栋房子里的每一件东西都浸透着我的激情；每件东西都象征着我的童年时代和年少的憧憬。在那扇大门后我千百次地等候过你；在这座楼梯上我倾听过你的脚步声，在那儿我第一次看见你；透过这个窥视孔，我曾看着你进进出出；在你门前的小地毯上，我曾经跪在上面；钥匙开锁的声音对我来说总是你出现的信号。我的童年时代，我年少时的激情都定格在这几平米大的空间之中。这里有我的整个一生，过去的一切如一场巨大的风暴向我席卷而来，因为一切都如愿以偿了，我和你走在一起，和你一起，走进你的，也是我们的房子。想想吧（我这话听起来很是无关紧要，可是我不知道其他更好的表达了），一直到你的房门口，一切都是在现实世界中，就是我以前生活的那个沉闷、平凡的世界。而在你房门口，则开始了我幼稚幻想中的魔法世界，阿拉丁的王国。想想吧，我千百次地用我炽烈如火的目光盯着我现在飘飘然走过这扇门。你会模模糊糊地察觉到——也只是模模糊糊地察觉到而已——这重要的时刻对我意味着什么。","We went up to your flat.Forgive me, beloved, for saying that you cannot possibly understand all that it meant to me to go up those stairs with you—how I was mad, tortured, almost suffocated with happiness.Even now I can hardly think of it without tears, but I have no tears left.Everything in that house had been steeped in my passion; everything was a symbol of my childhood and its longing.There was the door behind which a thousand times I had awaited your coming; the stairs on which I had heard your footstep, and where I had first seen you; the judas through which I had watched your comings and goings; the door-mat on which I had once knelt; the sound of a key in the lock, which had always been a signal to me.My childhood and its passions were nested within these few yards of space.Here was my whole life, and it surged around me like a great storm, for all was being fulfilled, and I was going with you, I with you, into your, into our house.Think (the way I am phrasing it sounds trivial, but I know no better words) that up to your door was the world of reality, the dull everyday world which had been that of all my previous life.At this door began the magic world of my childish imaginings, Aladdin’s realm.Think how, a thousand times, I had had my burning eyes fixed upon this door through which I was now passing, my head in a whirl, and you will have an inkling—no more—of all that this tremendous minute meant to me."
"那天晚上，我整夜都和你在一起。你做梦都不会想到，在你之前，还没有一个男人触碰过或者看见过我的身体。可是你又怎么会想到这个呢，因为我对你毫不抗拒，我抑制羞涩的痕迹，害怕会泄露我爱你的秘密。这肯定会吓你一跳的，因为你只喜欢轻松自在、悠然自得、洒脱不拘的生活。你害怕被卷进别人的命运之中。你喜欢将你的爱自由地给予所有的女人——但不愿意作出任何牺牲。如今我告诉你委身于你时我还是处女之身，你可不要误解我。我不是在怪你。你并没有勾引我，没有欺骗我，也没有诱惑我。我是自己投入你的怀抱，走入我的命运之中的。那天晚上我很幸福，为此我对你心怀的全部都是感激。当我在黑暗中睁开眼睛，看到你躺在我的身边时，我觉得自己一定到了天堂，奇怪群星怎么不在我头上闪烁。亲爱的，我从未后悔在那天夜里把自己给了你。当你睡在我的身边，当我听到你的呼吸，触摸到你的身体，感觉到自己离你如此近时，我幸福得泪流满面。","I stayed with you that night.You did not dream that before you no man had ever touched or seen my body.How could you fancy it, when I made no resistance, and when I suppressed every trace of shame, fearing lest I might betray the secret of my love.That would certainly have alarmed you; you care only for what comes and goes easily, for that which is light of touch, is imponderable.You dread being involved in anyone else’s destiny.You like to give yourself freely to all the world—but not to make any sacrifices.When I tell you that I gave myself to you as a maiden, do not misunderstand me.I am not making any charge against you.You did not entice me, deceive me, seduce me.I threw myself into your arms; went out to meet my fate.I have nothing but thankfulness towards you for the blessedness of that night.When I opened my eyes in the darkness and you were beside me, I felt that I must be in heaven, and I was amazed that the stars were not shining on me.Never, beloved, have I repented giving myself to you that night.When you were sleeping beside me, when I listened to your breathing, touched your body, and felt myself so near you, I shed tears for very happiness."
"第二天一早我就离开了。我得去上班，而且我也想在你仆人进来之前离开。我正准备要走时，你搂住我，看了我好久。是你心头涌起了一些模糊的记忆，还是仅仅因为我当时脸上洋溢着幸福的光芒，使得自己在你眼中美丽动人？你在我的唇上吻了一下，我动身准备离开。你问我：“你不想带几朵花走吗？”书桌上的那只蓝色水晶花瓶里有四朵白玫瑰（我以前就认得这个花瓶，小时候我偷偷看到过），你把这些花给了我。这些玫瑰我吻了好几天。","I went away early in the morning.I had to go to my work, and I wanted to leave before your servant came.When I was ready to go, you put your arm round me and looked at me for a very long time.Was some obscure memory stirring in your mind; or was it simply that my radiant happiness made me seem beautiful to you?You kissed me on the lips, and I moved to go.You asked me: “Would you not like to take a few flowers with you?”There were four white roses in the blue crystal vase on the writing-table (I knew it of old from that stolen glance of childhood), and you gave them to me.For days they were mine to kiss."
"我们约好了某个晚上再次见面。那又是一个美妙甜蜜的晚上。你还给了我第三个晚上。然后你说你必需要离开维也纳一段时间——哦，我一直以来都对你出门旅行恨得要死——你许诺一回来就会通知我。我只给了你一个邮局保管待取的地址，我没有告诉你我的真实姓名。我牢牢守着自己的秘密。在分别时你又给了我几朵玫瑰。 ","We had arranged to meet on a second evening.Again it was full of wonder and delight.You gave me a third night.Then you said that you were called away from Vienna for a time—oh, how I had always hated those journeys of yours—and promised that I should hear from you as soon as you came back.I would only give you a poste-restante address, and did not tell you my real name.I guarded my secret.Once more you gave me roses at parting."
"这两个月里我每天都亲自去问……不，我不愿向你描述这种夹杂着期待和绝望的痛苦。我不怨你。我爱你，就是爱这样的你，感情炽烈却生性健忘，温柔多情而用情不专的你。你一直以来就是这样的人，但我就是爱这样的你。远不到两个月你就回来了。我从你窗内的灯光就看出来了，但你没有写信给我。到我生命最后的时刻我也没有收到过你的一行字，我把我的生命都给你了，可是我从没收到过你的一行字。我等着，绝望地等着。你没有叫我去找你，没有给我写一个字，一个字也没有……","Day after day for two months I asked myself....No, I will not describe the anguish of my expectation and despair.I make no complaint.I love you just as you are, ardent and forgetful, generous and unfaithful.I love you just as you have always been.You were back long before the two months were up.The light in your windows showed me that, but you did not write to me.In my last hours I have not a line in your handwriting, not a line from you to whom my life was given.I waited, waited despairingly.You did not call me to you, did not write a word, not a word...."
"我昨天死去的孩子也是你的孩子。他是你的儿子，是在那三个夜晚中的一晚孕育的孩子。我是你的，从那个时候到他出生那一刻我都只是你的。我觉得自己的身体因你的触碰而变得神圣起来，因此我不可能再接受其他男人的爱抚。他是我们的孩子，亲爱的，是我全身心的爱和你漫不经心、浪荡不羁，几乎是无意间付出的柔情的结晶。我们的孩子，我们的儿子，我们唯一的孩子。也许你会吓一跳，也许仅仅有些吃惊。你会问为什么我从来没有告诉你这个孩子的事；为什么沉默了这么多年，到了现在，在他永远沉睡，即将永远离开我，永远也回不来的时候才告诉你他的事。我怎么能告诉你呢？我只是一个陌生人，一个过分热切地和你共度了三个晚上的女人。你永远也不会相信，我，你偶然间碰到的无名女人，会一直对你这个用情不专的男人忠贞不渝。你永远也不会毫无疑虑地承认这孩子是你的骨肉。即使表面上你相信了我的话，你仍然会私下怀疑我是找了个机会硬让你这个有钱人做孩子的父亲，而他有可能是我另一个情人的孩子。你会一直怀有疑心。在你我之间永远会存在一片怀疑的阴影。这是我不能忍受的。再说，我了解你。也许我比你自己更了解你。你喜欢无牵无挂、逍遥自在、绝对无拘无束，这是你对爱的理解。发现自己突然之间成为了父亲，突然之间要对一个孩子的命运负责，你会感到厌恶的。自由的空气是你生命的气息，你会觉得我是个羁绊。在你内心深处，你甚至会违背了理智来恨我，会认为我给你套上了枷锁。也许偶尔地，也许只是一个小时，或是短短的一分钟，你会觉得我是你的负担，会因此而恨我。但是我的自尊和骄傲使我这辈子都决不会成为你的麻烦和负担。我宁可独自承担一切责任，也不愿成为你累赘。我想成为你亲密接触过的女人当中你想起时只会满怀爱恋和感激的那一个。可事实上，你从来就没有想过我。你把我忘了。","My boy who died yesterday was yours too.He was your son, the child of one of those three nights.I was yours, and yours only from that time until the hour of his birth.I felt myself sanctified by your touch, and it would not have been possible for me then to accept any other man’s caresses.He was our boy, dear; the child of my fully conscious love and of your careless, spendthrift, almost unwitting tenderness.Our child, our son, our only child.Perhaps you will be startled, perhaps merely surprised.You will wonder why I never told you of this boy; and why, having kept silence throughout the long years, I only tell you of him now, when he lies in his last sleep, about to leave me for all time never, never to return.How could I have told you?I was a stranger, a girl who had shown herself only too eager to spend those three nights with you.Never would you have believed that I, the nameless partner in a chance encounter, had been faithful to you, the unfaithful.You would never, without misgivings, have accepted the boy as your own.Even if, to all appearance, you had trusted my word, you would still have cherished the secret suspicion that I had seized an opportunity of fathering upon you, a man of means, the child of another lover.You would have been suspicious.There would always have been a shadow of mistrust between you and me.I could not have borne it.Besides, I know you.Perhaps I know you better than you know yourself.You love to be care-free, light of heart, perfectly at ease; and that is what you understand by love.It would have been repugnant to you to find yourself suddenly in the position of father; to be made responsible, all at once, for a child’s destiny.The breath of freedom is the breath of life to you, and you would have felt me to be a tie.Inwardly, even in defiance of your conscious will, you would have hated me as an embodied claim.Perhaps only now and again, for an hour or for a fleeting minute, should I have seemed a burden to you, should I have been hated by you.But it was my pride that I should never be a trouble or a care to you all my life long.I would rather take the whole burden on myself than be a burden to you; I wanted to be the one among all the women you had intimately known of whom you would never think except with love and thankfulness.In actual fact, you never thought of me at all.You forgot me."
"我不是在责怪你。相信我，我不是在抱怨。如果有时候我的笔下似乎流露出一丝怨尤的话，你一定要原谅我。你一定要原谅我，因为我的儿子，我们的儿子死了，就躺在这闪烁不定的烛光下。我冲上帝握紧了拳头，称他为凶手，因为我过于悲伤，几乎神志混乱了。原谅我的抱怨吧。我知道你心地善良，总是乐于助人。","I am not accusing you.Believe me, I am not complaining.You must forgive me if for a moment, now and again, it seems as if my pen had been dipped in gall.You must forgive me; for my boy, our boy, lies dead there beneath the flickering candles.I have clenched my fists against God, and have called him a murderer, for I have been almost beside myself with grief.Forgive me for complaining.I know that you are kindhearted, and always ready to help."
"即便是素不相识的人开口向你求助，你也会给予帮助。可是你的善心很奇特。它是没有任何限制的。每个人都可以得到，请求多少就能得到多少。可是，我要说你的善心行动力迟缓。你需要别人来求你。你帮助的是那些请求你帮助的人。你是出于难为情，出于软弱，而不是为了纯粹的助人的快乐而帮助人。让我坦率地跟你说吧，那些受苦受难的人在你眼中并不比你那些幸福快乐的兄弟更可亲。像你这种类型的人，即使是其中最善良的人，也是让人很难去开口请求的。有一次，当我还是个孩子的时候，我通过我们房门的窥视孔看见了你是如何拿东西给一个按你门铃的乞丐的。他几乎还没开口，你就很快很慷慨地施舍了他。可是你的样子有些紧张和慌忙，似乎是想把他赶快打发走，你好像害怕看到他的眼睛。我永远也不会忘记你帮助别人时拘谨不安、羞怯腼腆、唯恐人感谢的样子。这就是为什么我在困难时从没去找你的原因。哦，我知道你会给我我需要的一切帮助，尽管你会怀疑我的孩子是不是你的。你会安慰我，给我钱，一大笔钱，可是总会暗暗带着一种焦躁不耐的情绪，悄悄想着摆脱掉这个麻烦。我甚至觉得你会建议我把即将到来的孩子打掉。这是我最害怕的，因为我知道我会做任何你希望我去做的事。可这孩子是我的一切。他是你的骨肉；他是你的再生——但不是幸福快乐、无忧无虑、我永远也没有希望留住的你；而是一个给了我的、从我身上掉下来的、和我的生命紧紧连在一起的你。我终于牢牢地抓住你了；我能够感觉到你的生命之血在我的血管里流淌；我可以哺育你，爱抚你，亲吻你，只要我心底有这样的渴望。这就是为什么我知道怀了你的孩子时感到那么地幸福，这就是为什么我没有告诉你这个秘密。从今往后，你再不会从我身边溜走了，你是我的了。 ","You will help the merest stranger at a word.But your kindliness is peculiar.It is unbounded.Anyone may have of yours as much as lie can grasp with both hands.And yet, I must say it, your kindliness works sluggishly.You need to be asked.You help those who call for help; you help from shame, from weakness, and not from sheer joy in helping.Let me tell you openly that those who are in affliction and torment are not dearer to you than your brothers in happiness.Now, it is hard, very hard, to ask anything of such as you, even of the kindest among you.Once, when I was still a child, I watched through the judas in our door how you gave something to a beggar who had rung your bell.You gave quickly and freely, almost before he spoke.But there was a certain nervousness and haste in your manner, as if your chief anxiety were to be speedily rid of him; you seemed to be afraid to meet his eye.I have never forgotten this uneasy and timid way of giving help, this shunning of a word of thanks.That is why I never turned to you in my difficulty.Oh, I know that you would have given me all the help I needed, in spite of your doubt that my child was yours.You would have offered me comfort, and have given me money, an ample supply of money; but always with a masked impatience, a secret desire to shake off trouble.I even believe that you would have advised me to rid myself of the coming child.This was what I dreaded above all, for I knew that I should do whatever you wanted.But the child was all in all to me.It was yours; it was you reborn—not the happy and care-free you, whom I could never hope to keep; but you, given to me for my very own, flesh of my flesh, intimately intertwined with my own life.At length I held you fast; I could feel your life-blood flowing through my veins; I could nourish you, caress you, kiss you, as often as my soul yearned.That was why I was so happy when I knew that I was with child by you, and that is why I kept the secret from you.Henceforward you could not escape me; you were mine."
"不过你也别以为等待孩子出生的这几个月都像我初时想象得那么幸福快乐。这几个月也充满了伤痛和烦忧，充满了对人类卑劣行径的憎恶。我的日子很不好过。临产前几个月我不能再到公司里去上班，要不然我继父的亲戚会发现我怀孕的事，然后会告诉我家里。我也不想向我母亲要钱，所以临近分娩的那段日子我都是靠变卖些首饰来维持生活。产前一个礼拜，我身边仅剩的几枚克朗被我的洗衣工偷走了，因此我只好到妇产医院去生孩子。这个孩子，你的儿子就出生在那儿，出生在那个破败凄凉的收容所，出生在一群穷困潦倒、无家可归、遭人遗弃的人中间。那地方死气沉沉的。一切都那么陌生，那么冷漠。我们一群互不相识的人，孤独寂寞地躺在那儿，相互仇视，仅仅是因为共同的贫穷和困苦集中到了这间拥挤不堪、散发着氯仿和鲜血气味、充满了叫喊和呻吟的病房里。除了临床记录表上面的名字，这些病房里的病人都失去了个性。躺在床上的只是一块颤动的肉，一个供人研究的物体……","But you must not suppose that the months of waiting passed so happily as I had dreamed in my first transports.They were full of sorrow and care, full of loathing for the baseness of mankind.Things went hard with me.I could not stay at work during the later months, for my stepfather’s relatives would have noticed my condition, and would have sent the news home.Nor would I ask my mother for money; so until my time came I managed to live by the sale of some trinkets.A week before my confinement, the few crown-pieces that remained to me were stolen by my laundress, so I had to go to the maternity hospital.The child, your son, was born there, in that asylum of wretchedness, among the very poor, the outcast, and the abandoned.It was a deadly place.Everything was strange, was alien.We were all alien to one another, as we lay there in our loneliness, filled with mutual hatred, thrust together only by our kinship of poverty and distress into this crowded ward, reeking of chloroform and blood, filled with cries and moaning.A patient in these wards loses all individuality, except such as remains in the name at the head of the clinical record.What lies in the bed is merely a piece of quivering flesh, an object of study...."
"我要请你原谅我说了这些事。以后我再也不会说起这些事了。我已经沉默了十一年，而且很快就会永远沉默下去了。但至少，我得大声叫上一次，让你知道我付出了多大的代价才得到这个孩子，这个孩子是我的幸福和快乐所在，可现在却躺在那里，死去了。我早已忘掉了那可怕的时日，在孩子的微笑和声音中忘了那些苦难，在孩子给我的幸福中忘了那一切。可是现在，孩子死了，这些痛苦又涌上心头，这一次我不得不说出来了。但我不怪你，只怪上帝，只怪让这毫无目的的痛苦和折磨随意蔓延的上帝。我从来也没有生过你的气。即使在承受分娩剧痛之时，我对你也没有一丝怨恨；我从未后悔过和你缠绵的那几夜；从未停止过爱你，或者说从未停止过感激你进入我生命的那一刻。倘若在完全知道后来发生的一切后，还要我进地狱去重新经历那些痛苦，我还是会乐意接受，不是一次，而是很多次。 ","I ask your forgiveness for speaking of these things.I shall never speak of them again.For eleven years I have kept silence, and shall soon be dumb for evermore.Once, at least, I had to cry aloud, to let you know how dearly bought was this child, this boy who was my delight, and who now lies dead.I had forgotten those dreadful hours, forgotten them in his smiles and his voice, forgotten them in my happiness.Now, when he is dead, the torment has come to life again; and I had, this once, to give it utterance.But I do not accuse you; only God, only God who is the author of such purposeless affliction.Never have I cherished an angry thought of you.Not even in the utmost agony of giving birth did I feel any resentment against you; never did I repent the nights when I enjoyed your love; never did I cease to love you, or to bless the hour when you came into my life.Were it necessary for me, fully aware of what was coming, to relive that time in hell, I would do it gladly, not once, but many times."
"我们的孩子昨天死了，而你从来都不知道他。这个聪明伶俐的小人儿与你没有过任何接触，即使是匆匆地偶遇也没有，你的目光也从未在他身上停留过。我们的儿子出生后很长一段时间，我都躲着你。我对你的相思不那么强烈了。事实上，我相信我对你的爱也不那么狂热了。当然，因为有了这个孩子，我对你的爱也不那么让我痛苦了。我不愿把自己分开来，一半给你，一半给他，因此我不再管你，因为你很幸福，没有我也活得很好，可孩子需要我，我得抚养他，我可以亲吻他、爱抚他。我似乎已经摆脱了对你神魂颠倒的思恋。我的厄运似乎由于这另一个你，一个真正属于我的你的诞生而离我而去。现在，只是在很少很少的时候，我的心里才会产生到你寓所去找你的念头。只有一件事我还在做：每逢你生日，我总要给你送去一束白玫瑰，就像我们恩爱的第一夜之后你送给我的那些玫瑰一样。在这十年或是十一年间，你有没有自问过是谁送来的花？你有没有想起过你曾经送过这样的玫瑰给一个女孩？我不知道，而且永远也不会知道答案了。对我来说，暗地里把花送给你就够了；一年一次，唤起我自己对那一刻的回忆就够了。 ","Our boy died yesterday, and you never knew him.His bright little personality has never come into the most fugitive contact with you, and your eyes have never rested on him.For a long time after our son was born, I kept myself hidden from you.My longing for you had become less overpowering.Indeed, I believe I loved you less passionately.Certainly, my love for you did not hurt so much, now that I had the boy.I did not wish to divide myself between you and him, and so I did not give myself to you, who were happy and independent of me, but to the boy who needed me, whom I had to nourish, whom I could kiss and fondle.I seemed to have been healed of my restless yearning for you.The doom seemed to have been lifted from me by the birth of this other you, who was truly my own.Rarely, now, did my feelings reach out towards you in your dwelling.One thing only—on your birthday I have always sent you a bunch of white roses, like the roses you gave me after our first night of love.Has it ever occurred to you, during these ten or eleven years, to ask yourself who sent them?Have you ever recalled having given such roses to a girl?I do not know, and never shall know.For me it was enough to send them to you out of the darkness; enough, once a year, to revive my own memory of that hour."
"你从来没有见过我们的儿子。如今我责怪自己一直没让你见见他，因为如果你见了他，你会喜欢他的。你从未看过他睡醒后刚睁开眼时的微笑，他那乌黑的眼睛像极了你的眼睛，他用这双眼睛快乐地看着我和这个世界。他是多么聪明、多么可爱啊。你那潇洒不羁、天马行空般的想象力在他身上同样表现出来了——带着儿童的特点表现出来。他会连着几小时着迷似的玩着什么，就像你游戏人生一样，然后又一本正经地坐着看书看上好一阵子。他就是你，你的再生。你身上特有的玩笑戏谑和严肃认真的双重性格在他身上也越来越明显，而他越是像你，我就越是爱他。他学习很好，所以他可以像个小喜鹊似的滔滔不绝地说法语。他的作业本是全班最整洁的。他是个多么英俊强健的小伙子啊！夏天我带他到格拉多海滩玩的时候，女人们都会停下来摸摸他金色的头发。他在塞默林滑雪橇时，人们都会扭过头来看他。他是那么地俊俏，那么地文雅，那么地惹人疼爱。","You never knew our boy.I blame myself today for having hidden him from you, for you would have loved him.You have never seen him smile when he first opened his eyes after sleep, his dark eyes that were your eyes, the eyes with which he looked merrily forth at me and the world.He was so bright, so lovable.All your lightheartedness, and your mobile imagination were his likewise—in the form in which these qualities can show themselves in a child.He would spend entranced hours playing with things as you play with life; and then, grown serious, would sit long over his books.He was you, reborn.The mingling of sport and earnest, which is so characteristic of you, was becoming plain in him; and the more he resembled you, the more I loved him.He was good at his lessons, so that he could chatter French like a magpie.His exercise books were the tidiest in the class.And what a fine, upstanding little man he was!When I took him to the seaside in the summer, at Grado, women used to stop and stroke his fair hair.At Semmering, when be was tobogganing, people would turn round to gaze after him.He was so handsome, so gentle, so appealing."
"去年，他进了寄宿学校，开始穿上学校的制服，是十八世纪宫廷侍童穿的款式，腰带上佩着短剑——可现在他只穿了件衬衣躺在那里，嘴唇苍白，双手合在一起。 ","Last year, when he went to college as a boarder, he began to wear the collegiates’ uniform of an eighteenth century page, with a little dagger stuck in his belt—now he lies here in his shift, with pallid lips and crossed hands."
"你可能会奇怪我怎么可能给这个孩子这么富裕的成长环境，怎么可能使他过上有钱人的那种欢乐、快活的生活？亲爱的，我是在黑暗中跟你说话。抛开了廉耻之心，我会告诉你的。你可不要被我吓着了。我卖身了。我倒没有变成在街头拉客的那种普通妓女，可是我还是卖身了。我的朋友，我的情人都是有钱人。起初是我去找他们，但很快便是他们来找我了，因为我（你可曾注意到这一点吗？）是个很漂亮的女人。每一个我委身的男人都对我一往情深。他们都很感激我，倾慕我。他们都爱我——除了你，除了我深爱的你。","You will wonder how I could manage to give the boy so costly an upbringing, how it was possible for me to provide for him an entry into this bright and cheerful life of the well-to-do.Dear one, I am speaking to you from the darkness.Unashamed, I will tell you.Do not shrink from me.I sold myself.I did not become a street-walker, a common prostitute, but I sold myself.My friends, my lovers, were wealthy men.At first I sought them out, but soon they sought me, for I was (did you ever notice it?) a beautiful woman.Every one to whom I gave myself was devoted to me.They all became my grateful admirers.They all loved me—except you, except you whom I loved."
"我告诉了你我的所做所为，你会因此鄙视我吗？我相信你不会的。我知道你会理解这一切，会理解我所做的都只是为了你，为了另外的一个你，为了你的孩子。在妇产医院的时候，我尝尽了贫穷的可怕。我知道，在这个世界上，穷人总是遭人践踏的，总是牺牲品。我不能忍受你的儿子，你可爱的孩子生长在社会的底层，生活在肮脏腐朽的街道上，呼吸贫民窟龌龊的空气。他娇嫩的嘴唇不该去学那些粗鄙的语言，他白净细嫩的皮肤不能被穷人家破烂粗糙的衣裳擦伤。你的儿子应该在各方面都得到最妥善的照顾，应该享有人间所有的财富，过着最轻松快乐的生活。他应该跟随你生活的足迹，应该生活在你生活过的圈子里。","Will you despise me now that I have told you what I did?I am sure you will not.I know you will understand everything, will understand that what I did was done only for you, for your other self, for your boy.In the lying-in hospital I had tasted the full horror of poverty.I knew that, in the world of the poor, those who are down-trodden are always the victims.I could not bear to think that your son, your lovely boy, was to grow up in that abyss, amid the corruptions of the street, in the poisoned air of a slum.His delicate lips must not learn the speech of the gutter; his fine, white skin must not be chafed by the harsh and sordid underclothing of the poor.Your son must have the best of everything, all the wealth and all the lightheartedness of the world.He must follow your footsteps through life, must dwell in the sphere in which you had lived."
"这就是为什么我会出卖肉体。这对我来说不是牺牲，因为一般所谓的“名誉”、“耻辱”对我来说都是没有什么意义的字眼。我的身体只属于你一个人，可是你不爱我，那么我用我的身子来做什么又有什么关系呢？我那些男伴们的爱怜，甚至于他们最炽热的情感，都不能打动我的心扉，尽管他们中有很多人令我尊敬，尽管想到自己的命运会使我同情他们不求回报的爱。所有这些男人对我都很好；他们都宠着我惯着我，他们也都十分尊重我。其中有个上了年纪的丧妻的伯爵，四方奔走，八方求情让你的孩子得以被寄宿中学录取。这个男人像爱女儿那样地爱我。他向我求了三四次婚。我若是答应了，今天可能已经是个伯爵夫人，是蒂罗尔一座豪华城堡的女主人了。我本可以过上无忧无虑的生活，因为孩子将会有一个非常疼爱他的父亲，而我会有一个沉稳、高贵、善良的丈夫。但是我始终没有答应他，尽管我知道这让他很痛苦。我这样也许很傻。如果我答应了他，我现在就应该会在某个地方过着安稳隐逸的生活，我的孩子也还会和我在一起。我干嘛要向你隐瞒我拒绝的原因呢？我不愿意束缚自己。我想一直保持自由之身——为了你。在我内心深处，在我的潜意识里．我还继续做着童年时的梦。有一天，也许你会把我再叫到你身边，哪怕仅仅是一个小时。为了这可能有的一个小时，我拒绝了所有人的求婚，只为了能够自由地回应你的召唤。自从第一次觉得自己成为了一个女人起，我这一生除了等待，等待你爱我之外，还有什么呢？","That is why I sold myself.It was no sacrifice to me, for what are conventionally termed “honour” and “disgrace” were unmeaning words to me.You were the only one to whom my body could belong, and you did not love me, so what did it matter what I did with that body?My companions’ caresses, even their most ardent passion, never sounded my depths, although many of them were persons I could not but respect, and although the thought of my own fate made me sympathise with them in their unrequited love.All these men were kind to me; they all petted and spoiled me; they all paid me every deference.One of them, a widower, an elderly man of title, used his utmost influence until he secured your boy’s nomination to the college.This man loved me like a daughter.Three or four times he urged me to marry him.I could have been a countess today, mistress of a lovely castle in Tyrol.I could have been free from care, for the boy would have had a most affectionate father, and I should have had a sedate, distinguished, and kindhearted husband.But I persisted in my refusal, though I knew it gave him pain.It may have been foolish of me.Had I yielded, I should have been living a safe and retired life somewhere, and my child would still have been with me.Why should I hide from you the reason for my refusal?I did not want to bind myself.I wanted to remain free—for you.In my innermost self, in the unconscious, I continued to dream the dream of my childhood.Some day, perhaps, you would call me to your side, were it only for an hour.For the possibility of this one hour I rejected everything else, simply that I might be free to answer your call.Since my first awakening to womanhood, what had my life been but waiting, a waiting upon your will?"
"最后，我期待的时刻来了。可是你仍然不知道这个时刻已经到来，永远也不知道！那时，你和几个朋友坐在我隔壁的桌子，向我投来赞赏渴慕的目光以示问候，这目光总是让我心神激荡，难以言喻。十年来，你第一次又带着你天性中具有的那种无意识的激情看着我。我浑身颤栗，手抖动得厉害，手上的葡萄酒杯几乎掉了下来。幸好我的同伴们没有注意到我这个样子，因为他们已经沉迷在了周围的笑闹声和音乐声中了。","In the end, the expected hour came.And still you never knew that it had come!When it came, you were sitting with some friends at the next table, regarding me with an admiring and covetous glance, that glance which had always thrilled me beyond expression.For the first time in ten years you were looking at me again under the stress of all the unconscious passion in your nature.I trembled, and my hand shook so violently that I nearly let my wineglass fall.Fortunately my companions did not notice my condition, for their perceptions were confused by the noise of laughter and music."
"你的目光变得越来越来越灼热，使我浑身如着火般燥热。我不知道你是最终认出了我，还是你觉得这个陌生的女人激起了你的追求欲望。我双颊通红，我心不在焉地说着话。你不禁注意到了你的目光对我造成的影响。你稍稍摆了一下头向我示意，要我去一下前厅。接着你付了帐，告别了你的同伴，离开了桌子，在离开前再一次向我暗示你会在外面等我。我浑身颤抖，就像发高烧时浑身发冷一样。我没法回答别人的话，也不能控制我周身沸腾奔涌的热血。恰好这时有一对黑人脚后跟踩得劈啪乱响，尖叫着跳起一种粗野狂放的舞蹈来。大家都扭头看向他们，我抓住了这个机会。我站了起来，对我的朋友说，我出去一下，马上回来，然后跟着你走了出去。 ","Your look became continually more ardent, and touched my own senses to fire.I could not be sure whether you had at last recognised me, or whether your desires had been aroused by one whom you believed to be a stranger.My cheeks were flushed, and I talked at random.You could not help noticing the effect your glance had on me.You made an inconspicuous movement of the head, to suggest my coming into the anteroom for a moment.Then, having settled your bill, you took leave of your associates, and left the table, after giving me a further sign that you intended to wait for me outside.I shook like one in the cold stage of a fever.I could no longer answer when spoken to, could no longer control the tumult of my blood.At this moment, as chance would have it, a couple of negroes with clattering heels began a barbaric dance, to the accompaniment of their own shrill cries.Everyone turned to look at them, and I seized my opportunity.Standing up, I told my friend that I would be back in a moment, and followed you."
"你正在外面前厅里等我，我一出来，你的脸上就露出了喜色。你嘴角带笑，快步迎了上来。很明显，你没有认出我来，没有认出当年的那个小女孩，也没有认出后来的那个少女。又一次，对你而言，我是一个新认识的女人。","You were waiting for me in the lobby, and your face lighted up when I came.With a smile on your lips, you hastened to meet me.It was plain that you did not recognise me, neither the child, nor the girl of old days.Again, to you, I was a new acquaintance."
"“你可否给我一个小时的时间呢？”你用亲昵的语气问我，这语气表明你是把我当作那种任何人都可以买上一夜的女人了。“行。”我答道，这声颤抖但完全顺从的“行”和十多年前你在那条幽暗的街上听到少女时代的我说出的那个字一样。“告诉我我们什么时候可以见面吧。”你说道。“你想什么时候都行。”我回答道，因为我在你面前是不知道羞耻的。你稍微有些惊讶地看着我，惊讶之中带着疑虑、好奇的神情，就和以前你见我一口答应你的邀请时的神情一样。“现在行吗？”迟疑了片刻之后，你问道。“行，”我回答，“咱们走吧。”","“Have you really got an hour to spare for me?” you asked in a confident tone, which showed that you took me for one of the women whom anyone can buy for a night.“Yes,” I answered; the same tremulous but perfectly acquiescent “Yes” that you had heard from me in my girlhood, more than ten years earlier, in the darkling street.“Tell me when we can meet,” you said.“Whenever you like,” I replied, for I knew nothing of shame where you were concerned.You looked at me with a little surprise, with a surprise which had in it the same flavour of doubt mingled with curiosity which you had shown before when you were astonished at the readiness of my acceptance.“Now?” you enquired, after a moment’s hesitation.“Yes,” I replied, “let us go.”"
"我到衣帽间去取我的大衣时突然想起，我那个叫布鲁恩的朋友把我们的东西都放在一起了，而取衣帽的票也在他那里。我不可能回去向他要票，而且对我来说我更不可能放弃我盼望了多年的和你在一起的这一小时。我立即做出了选择。我将围巾披在身上，就走进了雾气弥漫的夜色中，撇开我的大衣不顾，也同样撇开了那个我跟了几年的心地善良的男人——也不管这是在公共场合，在他的朋友面前，这样会使他丢尽脸面，成为人们的笑料：一个陌生男子一点头，情妇就撇下他跑掉了。我内心深处非常清楚，我对一个善良的朋友做出了多么卑鄙恶劣、多么忘恩负义的事啊。我知道自己可耻愚蠢的行径会使他永远疏远我，我正在把自己的生活搞得一团糟。可是他的友谊，我自己的生活和再一次亲吻你的嘴唇，再次聆听你声音的机会相比又算得了什么呢。如今一切都过去了，都消逝了，我可以把这些告诉你，可以让你知道我有多爱你了。我相信只要你召唤我，即使我已躺在床上，接受死亡，我也会获得力量站起来回应你的召唤。","I was about to fetch my wrap from the cloak-room, when I remembered that my Brunn friend had handed in our things together, and that he had the ticket.It was impossible to go back and ask him for it, and it seemed to me even more impossible to renounce this hour with you to which I had been looking forward for years.My choice was instantly made.I gathered my shawl around me, and went forth into the misty night, regardless not only of my cloak, but regardless, likewise, of the kindhearted man with whom I had been living for years—regardless of the fact that in this public way, before his friends, I was putting him into the ludicrous position of one whose mistress abandons him at the first nod of a stranger.Inwardly, I was well aware how basely and ungratefully I was behaving towards a good friend.I knew that my outrageous folly would alienate him from me forever, and that I was playing havoc with my life.But what was his friendship, what was my own life to me when compared with the chance of again feeling your lips on mine, of again listening to the tones of your voice.Now that all is over and done with I can tell you this, can let you know how I loved you.I believe that were you to summon me from my death-bed, I should find strength to rise in answer to your call."
"门口停着一辆出租车，我们上车去了你的寓所。再一次我可以听见你的声音，再一次我因走近你而心醉神迷，几乎和多年前一样感到幸福快乐又手足无措。但我无法向你描述这一切，在我们登上这熟悉的楼梯时，十年前的感觉又重新出现了。我感觉自己既生活在过去，也生活在现在，整个人已和你融合在一起了。你的房间没有多少变化。多了几张画，多了好多书，多了一两件家具——可是一切在我看来还是那么亲切熟悉。书桌上还是放着一个花瓶，里面插着玫瑰花——我的玫瑰花，是我前一天送给你的，以纪念一个女人，一个你记不得，也认不出的女人，即使她现在就近在你眼前，你握着她的手，你的嘴唇紧贴着她的嘴唇，你也认不出她来。可是，我还是很高兴看到我的花插在那儿，知道你珍爱着的东西有我的一丝气息，有我对你爱的呼吸。","There was a taxi at the door, and we drove to your rooms.Once more I could listen to your voice, once more I felt the ecstasy of being near you, and was almost as intoxicated with joy and confusion as I had been so long before.But I cannot describe it all to you, bow what I had felt ten years earlier was now renewed as we went up the well-known stairs together; how I lived simultaneously in the past and in the present, my whole being fused as it were with yours.In your rooms, little was changed.There were a few more pictures, a great many more books, one or two additions to your furniture—but the whole had the friendly look of an old acquaintance.On the writing-table was the vase with the roses—my roses, the ones I had sent you the day before as a memento of the woman whom you did not remember, whom you did not recognise, not even now when she was close to you, when you were holding her hand and your lips were pressed on hers.But it comforted me to see my flowers there, to know that you had cherished something that was an emanation from me, was the breath of my love for you."
"你把我搂在怀里。我又和你度过了一个美好的夜晚。可是即使在那个时候，你仍然没有认出我来。当我激动地回应你的温存和爱抚时，我清楚地感到你对一位你钟爱的情人和一个妓女的激情是一样的，都是完全随心所欲地放纵你的热情。你对我，这个从舞厅带出来的陌生女人，也立刻充满柔情、殷勤有礼。你不会轻慢地对待我，充满了令人销魂的炙热情欲。沉醉于过去的幸福之中，我又一次感觉到你本性中的这种两面性，理智的情感与肉欲的激情奇怪地交织在一起，而这使我还是个少女时便成为了你的奴隶。我从未见过一个男人使自己如此沉迷在欢娱的享受之中。没有哪个人像你这样彻底地放纵自己，而在激情过后，又会完全地、永远地、几乎是不近人情地遗忘一切。不过我也忘了自己。在黑暗中躺在你身边的我究竟是谁？是从前那个充满激情的女孩，是你儿子的母亲，还是一个陌生女人？在这美妙的夜晚，一切都是如此的亲切、熟悉，又是如此的新鲜。我祈祷，愿这欢乐能够持续到永远。 ","You took me in your arms.Again I stayed with you for the whole of one glorious night.But even then you did not recognise me.While I thrilled to your caresses, it was plain to me that your passion knew no difference between a loving mistress and a meretrix, that your spendthrift affections were wholly concentrated in their own expression.To me, the stranger picked up at a dancing-hall, you were at once affectionate and courteous.You would not treat me lightly, and yet you were full of an enthralling ardour.Dizzy with the old happiness, I was again aware of the two-sidedness of your nature, of that strange mingling of intellectual passion with sensual, which had already enslaved me to you in my childhood.In no other man have I ever known such complete surrender to the sweetness of the moment.No other has for the time being given himself so utterly as did you who, when the hour was past, were to relapse into an interminable and almost inhuman forgetfulness.But I, too, forgot myself.Who was I, lying in the darkness beside you?Was I the impassioned child of former days; was I the mother of your son; was I a stranger?Everything in this wonderful night was at one and the same time entrancingly familiar and entrancingly new.I prayed that the joy might last forever."
"可是黎明来临了。我们起床时已经很晚了，你请我留下来一起吃早餐。在餐厅，一个没有露面的佣人已经很谨慎地摆好了茶点，我们静静地聊着。你依旧用那种坦率诚挚的态度和我说话，依旧不提任何不得体的问题，对我本人也没有表现出什么好奇心。你没问我的名字，也没问我住在哪里。我对你来说，和以前一样，只不过是一次艳遇，一个无名的女人，一段结束后不会留下任何痕迹的激情时光。你告诉我你即将远行，要去南非两三个月。这话像丧钟一样打破了我的幸福：“结束了，结束了，结束了，已经忘了！”我恨不得扑倒在你的脚下，喊道：“带我去吧，这样你最终会认出我来的，过了这么多年，你总会认出我的！” 可是我腼腆胆怯，奴性十足又十分软弱。我能说的只是：“真遗憾。”你微笑着看看我说：“你真觉得遗憾吗？” ","But morning came.It was late when we rose, and you asked me to stay to breakfast.Over the tea, which an unseen hand had discreetly served in the dining-room, we talked quietly.As of old, you displayed a cordial frankness; and, as of old, there were no tactless questions, there was no curiosity about myself.You did not ask my name, nor where I lived.To you I was, as before, a casual adventure, a nameless woman, an ardent hour which leaves no trace when it is over.You told me that you were about to start on a long journey, that you were going to spend two or three months in Northern Africa.The words broke in upon my happiness like a knell: “Past, past, past and forgotten!”I longed to throw myself at your feet, crying: “Take me with you, that you may at length came to know me, at length after all these years!”But I was timid, cowardly, slavish, weak.All I could say was: “What a pity.”You looked at me with a smile—“Are you really sorry?”"
"这时我突然一股疯劲儿上来。我站起来，目不转睛地盯着你。然后我说道：“我爱的那个男人老是出门旅行。”我直直地看着你的眼睛。“现在，现在，”我想着，“现在他会认出我来了！”你只是笑笑，然后安慰我说：“他总会回来的。”我回答道：“是的，他会回来，可那时他已把一切都忘了。” ","For a moment I was as if frenzied.I stood up and looked at you fixedly.Then I said: “The man I love has always gone on a journey.”I looked you straight in the eyes.“Now, now,” I thought, “now he will recognise me!”You only smiled, and said consolingly: “One comes back after a time.”I answered: “Yes, one comes back, but one has forgotten by then.”"
"我说这话时想必非常激动，因为我的腔调使你动容了。你也站起来，注视着我，带着些讶异，又充满了温柔。你抓住我的双肩，说道：“美好的东西是忘不了的，我是不会忘记你的”。你目光专注地望着我，仿佛要把我的形象永远印在你的脑海里一样。当我感受到你这道穿透人心、探究着我整个生命的目光时，我禁不住幻想你无视我的魔咒终于要打破了。“他要认出我了！他要认出我了！”我整个灵魂因期待而颤抖起来。","I must have spoken with strong feeling, for my tone moved you.You, too, rose, and looked at me wonderingly and tenderly.You put your hands on my shoulders: “Good things are not forgotten, and I shall not forget you.”Your eyes studied me attentively, as if you wished to form an enduring image of me in your mind.When I felt this penetrating glance, this exploration of my whole being, I could not but fancy that the spell of your blindness would at last be broken.“He will recognise me!He will recognise me!”My soul trembled with expectation."
"可是你没有认出我来。没有，你没有认出我。我对你来说，从来没有像在那一刻那样陌生过，因为如果不是那样，你就不可能做出你几分钟后做的事情了。你又吻了我，深情地吻了我。我的头发被弄乱了，我只好再梳理一下。站在镜子前面，我从镜子里看到——当我看到那一幕时，我简直又羞又怕——我看到你悄悄地把几张钞票塞进我的暖手筒。我几乎忍不住要叫出声来；我几乎忍不住要扇你一个耳光。我和你共度了一夜，之后却付钱给我，给我这个从儿时起就爱着你的人，给我这个身为你儿子母亲的人。对你而言，我只不过是从舞厅里找来的一个妓女而已。你忘了我还不够，你还要付钱给我，还要这般地贬损我。 ","But you did not recognise me.No, you did not recognise me.Never had I been more of a stranger to you than I was at that moment, for had it been otherwise you could not possibly have done what you did a few minutes later.You had kissed me again, had kissed me passionately.My hair had been ruffled, and I had to tidy it once more.Standing at the glass, I saw in it—and as I saw, I was overcome with shame and horror—that you were surreptitiously slipping a couple of banknotes into my muff.I could hardly refrain from crying out; I could hardly refrain from slapping your face.You were paying me for the night I had spent with you, me who had loved you since childhood, me the mother of your son.To you I was only a prostitute picked up at a dancing-hall.It was not enough that you should forget me; you had to pay me, and to debase me by doing so."
"我急忙收拾起我的东西，我要赶快离开，我心里太痛苦了。我四处找我的帽子。帽子原来搁在书桌上，就在那只插着白玫瑰、我的玫瑰的那个花瓶旁边。我心里涌起一个无法抑制的渴望，我想最后再试一次唤起你的记忆。“你愿意给我一朵你的白玫瑰吗？”——“当然。”你答道，说着从花瓶里取出了所有的玫瑰。“可是这些花也许是一个女人、一个爱你的女人送给你的呢？” ——“也许吧，”你说，“我不知道。是别人送给我的，但我不知道是谁送的，所以我才这么喜欢它们。”我专注地看着你说：“也许它们是一个被你遗忘的女人送给你的！”","I hastily gathered up my belongings, that I might escape as quickly as possible; the pain was too great.I looked round for my hat.There it was, on the writing-table, beside the vase with the white roses, my roses.I had an irresistible desire to make a last effort to awaken your memory.“Will you give me one of your white roses?”—“Of course,” you answered, lifting them all out of the vase.“But perhaps they were given you by a woman, a woman who loves you?”—“Maybe,” you replied, “I don’t know.They were a present, but I don’t know who sent them; that’s why I’m so fond of them.”I looked at you intently: “Perhaps they were sent you by a woman whom you have forgotten!”"
"你吃了一惊。我却越发地紧盯着你。“认出我来，在这最后一刻认出我来吧！”我的目光呼喊着。可是你微笑着，尽管亲切真挚，却没有认出我。你又吻了我一下，但你没有认出我来。 ","You were surprised.I looked at you yet more intently.“Recognise me, only recognise me at last!” was the clamour of my eyes.But your smile, though cordial, had no recognition in it.You kissed me yet again, but you did not recognise me."
"我匆匆离开，因为我的眼泪就要夺眶而出了，我不想你看见我落泪。由于从房间里急冲出来，我在大门口差一点儿撞到了你的仆人约翰。他很尴尬，忙不迭闪到一边，然后热心地为我打开前厅的门。然后，就在这一瞬间，当我噙着眼泪看他时，这位老人的眼睛突然一亮。就在这一瞬间，我告诉你，他认出了我，这个从我童年时代起就没有再看见过我的人认出了我。我非常感激他，为此我恨不得跪倒在他面前，吻他的双手。我把你用来鞭笞我的钞票从暖手筒里扯出来，塞在他手里。他惊慌失措地看着我——在这一瞬间，我觉得他对我的了解比你一辈子对我的了解还多。每个人，每个人都渴望宠我，每个人都对我很好。但你，只有你把我忘了。你，只有你，从来没有认出我来。 ","I hurried away, for my eyes were filling with tears, and I did not want you to see.In the entry, as I precipitated myself from the room, I almost cannoned into John, your servant.Embarrassed but zealous, he got out of my way, and opened the front door for me.Then, in this fugitive instant, as I looked at him through my tears, a light suddenly flooded the old man’s face.In this fugitive instant, I tell you, he recognised me, the man who had never seen me since my childhood.I was so grateful, that I could have kneeled before him and kissed his hands.I tore from my muff the banknotes with which you had scourged me, and thrust them upon him.He glanced at me in alarm—for in this instant I think he understood more of me than you have understood in your whole life.Everyone, everyone, has been eager to spoil me; everyone has loaded me with kindness.But you, only you, forgot me.You, only you, never recognised me."
"我的孩子，我们的孩子死了。再也没有人让我去爱了，这个世界上再也没有人了，除了你。可是你是我的什么人呢——你从来没有，从来没有认出我是谁；你走过我身边，犹如跨过一条小溪；你踩到我身上，犹如踩在一块石头上；你总是无所顾忌地走你的路，却让我永远地等待着。曾经我以为把你抓住了。我抓住了你，你这飘忽不定的人，在孩子身上抓住了你。可他是你的儿子。一夜之间他就这样残忍地扔下我，悄悄地走上了他的旅途，他已经忘了我，永远不会回来了。我又是孤零零一个人，比以往任何时候都孤单。我一无所有，没有任何来源于你的东西。没有孩子，没有一个字，没有一句话，在你的记忆中没有一丁点位置。倘若有人在你面前提到我的名字，对你而言也只不过是个陌生人的名字而已。既然我对你来说已经死了，我又为何不乐意死去呢？既然你已离我而去，我又何必不离去呢？","My boy, our boy, is dead.I have no one left to love; no one in the world, except you.But what can you be to me—you who have never, never recognised me; you who stepped across me as you might step across a stream, you who trod on me as you might tread on a stone; you who went on your way unheeding, while you left me to wait for all eternity?Once I fancied that I could hold you for my own; that I held you, the elusive, in the child.But he was your son.In the night, he cruelly slipped away from me on a journey; he has forgotten me, and will never return.I am alone once more, more utterly alone than ever.I have nothing, nothing from you.No child, no word, no line of writing, no place in your memory.If anyone were to mention my name in your presence, to you it would be the name of a stranger.Shall I not be glad to die, since I am dead to you?Glad to go away, since you have gone away from me?"
"亲爱的，我不是在怨你。我不想让我的悲伤侵入你快乐的生活。不要担心我会再麻烦你。现在我的孩子死了，躺在那里，在这令人痛苦的时候，我渴望向你吐露我的心事，只此一次，请耐心听我说说吧。就这一次我必须要和你说说。然后我会悄然回到我晦暗的世界中去，不再作声，就像我一直对你保持沉默那样。可是只要我还继续活着，你就听不到我的呼喊。只有等我死去，你才会收到这份遗物，这份来自一个比其他所有人都爱你的女人的遗物，这个女人你从来没有认出来过，她始终在等着你的召唤，可你从来也没有召唤过她。也许，也许你收到这份遗物后会来找我，而我会第一次对你不忠，因为我已经永远长眠，听不到你的呼唤了。我没有给你留下任何照片，没有给你留下任何的纪念品，就像你什么也没给我留下一样，因为你现在永远也认不出我了。我活着的命运如此，死后的命运也是一样。我不想叫你在我最后的时刻来看我。我会自己离开，而你也不会知道我的姓名和我的样子。我会死得很轻松，因为你在远方，不会感到我的死亡。要是我的死会使你痛苦，我就无法死去了。 ","Beloved, I am not blaming you.I do not wish to intrude my sorrows into your joyful life.Do not fear that I shall ever trouble you further.Bear with me for giving way to the longing to cry out my heart to you this once, in the bitter hour when the boy lies dead.Only this once I must talk to you.Then I shall slip back into obscurity, and be dumb towards you as I have ever been.You will not even hear my cry so long as I continue to live.Only when I am dead will this heritage come to you from one who has loved you more fondly than any other has loved you, from one whom you have never recognised, from one who has always been awaiting your summons and whom You have never summoned.Perhaps, perhaps, when you receive this legacy you will call to me; and for the first time I shall be unfaithful to you, for I shall not hear you in the sleep of death.Neither picture nor token do I leave you, just as you left me nothing, for never will you recognise me now.That was my fate in life, and it shall be my fate in death likewise.I shall not summon you in my last hour; I shall go my way leaving you ignorant of my name and my appearance.Death will be easy to me, for you will not feel it from afar.I could not die if my death were going to give you pain."
"我再也写不下去了。我头晕脑胀，四肢疼痛，浑身发热。我得躺下了。也许一切很快就会结束了。也许，这一次，命运会对我开一次恩，我不用亲眼看着他们把我的孩子带走……我无法再写下去了。永别了，亲爱的，永别了。我把所有的感谢都给你。过去的一切都很好，不管怎么样，很好。我对你会一直心怀感激，直到我生命的最后一息。我很高兴把一切都告诉你了。尽管你不能完全理解，但你现在知道了，我一直以来是多么地爱你，而且我对你的爱从来不会成为你的负担。我很欣慰我不会负你。你光鲜亮丽的美好生活不会有什么改变。亲爱的，我的死不会给你带来伤害。这使我感到很安慰。","I cannot write any more.My head is so heavy; my limbs ache; I am feverish.I must lie down.Perhaps all will soon be over.Perhaps, this once, fate will be kind to me, and I shall not have to see them take away my boy....I cannot write any more.Farewell, dear one, farewell.All my thanks go out to you.What happened was good, in spite of everything.I shall be thankful to you till my last breath.I am so glad that I have told you all.Now you will know, though you can never fully understand, how much I have loved you; and yet my love will never be a burden to you.It is my solace that I shall not fail you.Nothing will be changed in your bright and lovely life.Beloved, my death will not harm you.This comforts me."
"可是有谁，哦，谁还会在你的生日给你送白玫瑰呢？花瓶会空的。再也不会有那丝来自我生命的气息和芳香一年一次地萦绕在你的房间里了。","But who, ah who, will now send you white roses on your birthday?The vase will be empty.No longer will come that breath, that aroma, from my life, which once a year was breathed into your room."
"我还有最后一个请求——第一个，也是最后一个。为了我，请做这件事吧。每年你过生日的时候——一个人想起自己的那一天——去买些玫瑰花，插在花瓶里吧。请这样去做吧，就像别人一年一度为逝去的爱人做一次弥撒一样。我已经不再相信上帝，因此不想别人给我做弥撒。我只信你。我爱的只有你。我只希望在你的心中继续活下去——一年就只活那么一天，温柔地、默默地活着，就像我一直以来活在你身边一样。请这样做吧，亲爱的，请这样去做……我对你的第一个请求，也是最后一个……谢谢，谢谢……我爱你，我爱你……永别了……","I have one last request—the first, and the last.Do it for my sake.Always on your birthday—a day when one thinks of oneself—get some roses and put them in the vase.Do it just as others, once a year, have a Mass said for the beloved dead.I no longer believe in God, and therefore I do not want a Mass said for me.I believe in you alone.I love none but you.Only in you do I wish to go on living—just one day in the year, softly, quietly, as I have always lived near you.Please do this, my darling, please do it....My first request, and my last....Thanks, thanks....I love you, I love you....Farewell...."
"信从他无力的双手中掉了下来。他久久地陷在沉思当中。是的，他对邻家的女孩，一个少女，一个舞厅的女人有一些模模糊糊的记忆——可是所有这些记忆都是朦朦胧胧、混乱不清的，就像哗哗流淌的溪水底下的一块石头，闪烁不定，变幻多端。那些影像在他脑中不时地闪现，但构不成整个画面。他感受到了丝丝涌动的记忆，但他还是想不起来。似乎所有这些影像他都梦见过，常常梦到，并且梦境非常鲜活——然而这些也只是虚无缥缈捉摸不定的梦中的幻影而已。他的目光落到了书桌上的那只蓝色花瓶上。瓶子是空的。多年来，在他生日这一天，瓶子都没有空过。他悚然一惊，似乎觉得有一扇看不见的门突然打开了，阴冷的风从另外一个世界穿过这扇门吹进了他紧闭的房间。他感觉到了一种死亡，感觉到了一种不朽的爱。某种情愫涌上他的心头，他脑中想起了那个死去的女人，无影无形，却充满激情，犹如远方传来的乐声。 ","The letter fell from his nerveless hands.He thought long and deeply.Yes, he had vague memories of a neighbour’s child, of a girl, of a woman in a dancing hall—all was dim and confused, like the flickering and shapeless view of a stone in the bed of a swiftly running stream.Shadows chased one another across his mind, but would not fuse into a picture.There were stirrings of memory in the realm of feeling, and still he could not remember.It seemed to him that he must have dreamed of all these figures, must have dreamed often and vividly—and yet they had only been the phantoms of a dream.His eyes wandered to the blue vase on the writing-table.It was empty.For years it had not been empty on his birthday.He shuddered, feeling as if an invisible door had been suddenly opened, a door through which a chill breeze from another world was blowing into his sheltered room.An intimation of death came to him, and an intimation of deathless love.Something welled up within him; and the thought of the dead woman stirred in his mind, bodiless and passionate, like the sound of distant music."
