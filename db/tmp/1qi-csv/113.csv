"眼镜","The Spectacles"
"作者：埃德加·爱伦·坡","By Edgar Allan Poe"
"许多年前，嘲笑“一见钟情”是一种潮流，但是和那些对此有着深切体验的人一样，善于思考的人总是一直在宣扬它的存在。现代在所谓的情感磁力学或者叫磁性审美学上的发现表明：人类最自然，因而也是最真实、最强烈的情感很可能就是那些像电流感应一样从心底油然而生的情感。简而言之，最快乐、最持久的心理情结就是一见倾心。有无数事例可以证明这个观点的真实性，下面我要坦白的故事将为其再增添一个事例。","MANY years ago, it was the fashion to ridicule the idea of “love at first sight”, but those who think, not less than those who feel deeply, have always advocated its existence.Modern discoveries, indeed, in what may be termed ethical magnetism or magnetoesthetics, render it probable that the most natural, and, consequently, the truest and most intense of the human affections are those which arise in the heart as if by electric sympathy—in a word, that the brightest and most enduring of the psychal fetters are those which are riveted by a glance.The confession I am about to make will add another to the already almost innumerable instances of the truth of the position."
"我的故事需要我叙述得稍微详细一些。我现在仍然非常年轻——还不到二十二岁。我目前的姓氏非常普通，甚至可以说是相当庸俗的——辛普森。我之所以说“目前”，是因为我只是最近才被人这么叫的。为了继承一个远房男性亲戚阿道弗斯·辛普森先生留下的一大笔遗产，在过去的一年里我通过法律程序‎接受了这个姓氏。遗嘱规定的条件是我必须采用立遗嘱人的姓氏——而不是教名。我的教名是拿破仑·波拿巴——或者，更恰当地说，它们是我的首名和中间名。","My story requires that I should be somewhat minute.I am still a very young man—not yet twenty-two years of age.My name, at present, is a very usual and rather plebeian one—Simpson.I say “at present;” for it is only lately that I have been so called—having legislatively adopted this surname within the last year in order to receive a large inheritance left me by a distant male relative, Adolphus Simpson, Esq.The bequest was conditioned upon my taking the name of the testator,—the family, not the Christian name; my Christian name is Napoleon Bonaparte—or, more properly, these are my first and middle appellations."
"我不太情愿地采用了辛普森这个姓氏，因为从祖先那里流传下来的真实姓氏是弗鲁瓦萨尔，我为自己拥有这个姓氏感到自豪。这是可以理解的，因为我相信我的祖先可以追溯到流传千古的《编年史》的作者。关于姓氏问题，我顺便提一下，我的一些直系前辈的姓氏在发音方面存在着惊人的巧合。我的父亲是巴黎的弗鲁瓦萨尔先生。他的妻子——即我的母亲，在十五岁的时候嫁给了他——是银行家克鲁瓦萨尔的长女克鲁瓦萨尔小姐。而银行家的妻子也是仅仅十六岁就结婚了，她是某位维克托·瓦萨尔的长女。非常奇怪的是，瓦萨尔先生娶了一位姓氏和他相似的女士——穆瓦萨尔小姐。她结婚的时候也还只是个孩子，而她的母亲，穆瓦萨尔夫人，在教堂举行婚礼时也只有十四岁。这种早婚现象在法国很普遍。这些穆瓦萨尔、瓦萨尔、克鲁瓦萨尔和弗鲁瓦萨尔都是直系血亲。尽管正如我所说的，我的姓氏通过法律程序变成了辛普森，但是我对此却是充满反感，因此有一段时间我在犹豫，面对这条多余而又烦人的附加条款，我还要不要接受这笔遗产。","I assumed the name, Simpson, with some reluctance, as in my true patronym, Froissart, I felt a very pardonable pride—believing that I could trace a descent from the immortal author of the “Chronicles.”While on the subject of names, by the by, I may mention a singular coincidence of sound attending the names of some of my immediate predecessors.My father was a Monsieur Froissart, of Paris.His wife—my mother, whom he married at fifteen—was a Mademoiselle Croissart, eldest daughter of Croissart the banker, whose wife, again, being only sixteen when married, was the eldest daughter of one Victor Voissart.Monsieur Voissart, very singularly, had married a lady of similar name—a Mademoiselle Moissart.She, too, was quite a child when married; and her mother, also, Madame Moissart, was only fourteen when led to the altar.These early marriages are usual in France.Here, however, are Moissart, Voissart, Croissart, and Froissart, all in the direct line of descent.My own name, though, as I say, became Simpson, by act of Legislature, and with so much repugnance on my part, that, at one period, I actually hesitated about accepting the legacy with the useless and annoying proviso attached."
"就个人天资而言，我没有任何缺陷。相反，我自认为长相无可挑剔，世人所说的英俊脸庞，我没有十分也有九分。我身高五英尺十一英寸。我的头发乌黑、卷曲。我的鼻子也相当漂亮。我的眼睛很大，是灰色的，尽管它们近视到了很不方便的程度，但从外观来看，人们不会看出它们有任何缺陷。尽管如此，近视总是令我很烦恼，除了戴眼镜之外，我已经试过了所有的补救方法。我年轻英俊，自然不喜欢戴眼镜，而且坚决不肯使用它。事实上，我不知道还有什么东西比眼镜更能丑化一个年轻人的相貌：就算不让你的整个容貌变得十足的伪善和苍老，也会让它透着一股严肃。另一方面，戴上眼镜有一种玩世不恭和矫揉造作的味道。到目前为止，我竭尽全力地对付着，没有戴过任何眼镜。但是这些纯属个人小节问题，毕竟不太重要。另外，我可以非常得意地说，我性格乐观、自信，做事雷厉风行，富有朝气和激情，而且我一直以来都深深爱慕着女性。","As to personal endowments, I am by no means deficient.On the contrary, I believe that I am well made, and possess what nine tenths of the world would call a handsome face.In height I am five feet eleven.My hair is black and curling.My nose is sufficiently good.My eyes are large and gray; and although, in fact they are weak a very inconvenient degree, still no defect in this regard would be suspected from their appearance.The weakness itself, however, has always much annoyed me, and I have resorted to every remedy—short of wearing glasses.Being youthful and good-looking, I naturally dislike these, and have resolutely refused to employ them.I know nothing, indeed, which so disfigures the countenance of a young person, or so impresses every feature with an air of demureness, if not altogether of sanctimoniousness and of age.An eyeglass, on the other hand, has a savor of downright foppery and affectation.I have hitherto managed as well as I could without either.But something too much of these merely personal details, which, after all, are of little importance.I will content myself with saying, in addition, that my temperament is sanguine, rash, ardent, enthusiastic—and that all my life I have been a devoted admirer of the women."
"去年冬天的一个晚上，在一个朋友——塔尔博特先生的陪同下，我走进了P剧院的一个包厢。那天晚上演的是歌剧，海报非常有吸引力，因此剧院里人山人海。但是我们还是及时地坐到了已经预订好的前排座位上。我们是费了点力气用胳膊肘推搡着才挤过去的。","One night last winter I entered a box at the P-Theatre, in company with a friend, Mr. Talbot.It was an opera night, and the bills presented a very rare attraction, so that the house was excessively crowded.We were in time, however, to obtain the front seats which had been reserved for us, and into which, with some little difficulty, we elbowed our way."
"我的朋友是一个音乐狂，一连两个小时他都一直在聚精会神地盯着舞台。与此同时，我则在通过观察观众来自娱自乐，大部分观众都是这个城市的上层人士。我这样玩够了，正打算把目光转向台上那位女主角，这时，我的目光却被一间私人包厢里的一个身影吸引了过去，并被牢牢地定格在那里，之前我一直没有注意到她。","For two hours my companion, who was a musical fanatico, gave his undivided attention to the stage; and, in the meantime, I amused myself by observing the audience, which consisted, in chief part, of the very elite of the city.Having satisfied myself upon this point, I was about turning my eyes to the prima donna, when they were arrested and riveted by a figure in one of the private boxes which had escaped my observation."
"即使我活上一千岁，也无法忘记我看到那个身影时的那种着迷的感觉。那是一个女性的身影，我从未见过那么婀娜多姿的体态。那张脸离我很远，朝向舞台，所以有几分钟我看不到她的容貌——但那轮廓美若天仙，任何别的词语都无法充分形容出它那绝美的比例——但即使在我写下“天仙”的时候，这个词也显得极度无力。","If I live a thousand years, I can never forget the intense emotion with which I regarded this figure.It was that of a female, the most exquisite I had ever beheld.The face was so far turned toward the stage that, for some minutes, I could not obtain a view of it—but the form was divine; no other word can sufficiently express its magnificent proportion—and even the term “divine” seems ridiculously feeble as I write it."
"我发现，美丽女子的魅力——优雅女子的魔力——永远是无法抗拒的。但眼前的女子却正是优雅的化身和体现，是我最狂野、最活跃的想象力的完美典范。包厢的结构使我差不多能够看到她的整个身影，只见她身高中等偏上，虽然气质还算不上高贵，却也十分接近了。她完美、丰腴的体态是那么诱人。我只能看到她的后脑勺，其轮廓堪比古希腊的普绪客，轻纱织成的雅致的女帽不仅没有掩盖头部的优美，反而将这种美凸显了出来。这顶帽子不禁使我想起阿普列乌斯说的“用风编织的衣服”。她的右臂搭在包厢的栏杆上，它的优美、匀称令我的每一根神经都兴奋了起来。时下流行的宽松开口的半袖衫从她的上臂垂了下来。袖口刚过胳膊肘。衬衫里面是一件面料柔软的紧身衣，袖口绣有华丽的蕾丝花边。花边优雅地垂到了手上，只露出纤细的手指。手指上戴着一枚闪闪发光的钻戒。我一眼就看出它价值不菲。那令人赞不绝口的圆润手腕上戴着手镯，显得更加迷人。手镯上镶有珠宝做成的、华丽的羽毛状饰品，能立刻准确无误地体现主人的富有和品味。","The magic of a lovely form in woman—the necromancy of female gracefulness—was always a power which I had found it impossible to resist, but here was grace personified, incarnate, the beau ideal of my wildest and most enthusiastic visions.The figure, almost all of which the construction of the box permitted to be seen, was somewhat above the medium height, and nearly approached, without positively reaching, the majestic.Its perfect fullness and tournure were delicious.The head of which only the back was visible, rivalled in outline that of the Greek Psyche, and was rather displayed than concealed by an elegant cap of gaze aerienne, which put me in mind of the ventum textile of Apuleius.The right arm hung over the balustrade of the box, and thrilled every nerve of my frame with its exquisite symmetry.Its upper portion was draperied by one of the loose open sleeves now in fashion.This extended but little below the elbow.Beneath it was worn an under one of some frail material, close-fitting, and terminated by a cuff of rich lace, which fell gracefully over the top of the hand, revealing only the delicate fingers, upon one of which sparkled a diamond ring, which I at once saw was of extraordinary value.The admirable roundness of the wrist was well set off by a bracelet which encircled it, and which also was ornamented and clasped by a magnificent aigrette of jewels—telling, in words that could not be mistaken, at once of the wealth and fastidious taste of the wearer."
"我至少凝视了这个优雅、高贵的身影半小时之久，就仿佛我突然变成了一个石人。这期间，我充分体会到了人们所颂扬和吟唱的“一见钟情”的魅力和真实性。我从没有体验过这种感觉，就算面对最为著名的、极其美丽的女子时也没有过。一种莫名其妙的心灵感应——我不得不承认这是一种磁力——似乎不仅把我的目光，还把我全部的思想和情感都吸引到了眼前的这位令人赞叹的尤物身上。我看到，我感到，我也知道我深深地、疯狂地、不可救药地爱上了她，尽管我还没有看到她的容颜。这种感情如此强烈地吞噬着我，以至于我相信即使她长相平凡，我对她的爱慕之情也不会消减多少。真爱，尤其是一见钟情的本质是如此不同寻常，它不依赖外部条件而存在，外部条件似乎只能催生或抑制它。","I gazed at this queenly apparition for at least half an hour, as if I had been suddenly converted to stone; and, during this period, I felt the full force and truth of all that has been said or sung concerning “love at first sight.”My feelings were totally different from any which I had hitherto experienced, in the presence of even the most celebrated specimens of female loveliness.An unaccountable, and what I am compelled to consider a magnetic, sympathy of soul for soul, seemed to rivet, not only my vision, but my whole powers of thought and feeling, upon the admirable object before me.I saw—I felt—I knew that I was deeply, madly, irrevocably in love—and this even before seeing the face of the person beloved.So intense, indeed, was the passion that consumed me, that I really believe it would have received little if any abatement had the features, yet unseen, proved of merely ordinary character, so anomalous is the nature of the only true love—of the love at first sight—and so little really dependent is it upon the external conditions which only seem to create and control it."
"正当我陶醉于她的美貌之中，观众中突然一阵骚动。这使她把头稍稍偏向了我这边，因此我看到了这张脸的整个侧面。它的美丽甚至出乎我的预料——但是有什么东西令我很失望，虽然我说不出是什么。我是说了“失望”，但这个词并不能表达我的感觉。我的诸多情绪立刻变得平静而愉悦。这些情绪中少了些欣喜若狂，而多了些平静的热情。这种感情也许是来源于她那圣母般慈祥的神情，但是我马上发现这种感情并不完全源自此处。还有某种别的东西——某种我无法明白的、神秘的东西——她脸上的某种表情令我有点不安，但又大大激起了我的兴趣。事实上，任何一个年轻而敏感的小伙子只要处在我当时的状态下都会采取一些过激的行动。如果这位女士是独自一人，毫无疑问我会走进她的包厢，不惜一切都要上前和她搭讪。但“幸运”的是，她有两个同伴——一位绅士和一位非常美丽的女士，这位女士从外表上看比她小几岁。","While I was thus wrapped in admiration of this lovely vision, a sudden disturbance among the audience caused her to turn her head partially toward me, so that I beheld the entire profile of the face.Its beauty even exceeded my anticipations—and yet there was something about it which disappointed me without my being able to tell exactly what it was.I said “disappointed,” but this is not altogether the word.My sentiments were at once quieted and exalted.They partook less of transport and more of calm enthusiasm of enthusiastic repose.This state of feeling arose, perhaps, from the Madonna-like and matronly air of the face; and yet I at once understood that it could not have arisen entirely from this.There was something else—some mystery which I could not develop—some expression about the countenance which slightly disturbed me while it greatly heightened my interest.In fact, I was just in that condition of mind which prepares a young and susceptible man for any act of extravagance.Had the lady been alone, I should undoubtedly have entered her box and accosted her at all hazards; but, fortunately, she was attended by two companions—a gentleman, and a strikingly beautiful woman, to all appearance a few years younger than herself."
"我脑子里盘算着上千种方案，关于以后如何把自己介绍给那位年龄稍长的女士，或现在如何想尽一切办法来更加清楚地看到她的美貌。我本想坐得离她更近一些，但这是不可能的，因为剧院里拥挤不堪。即使我有幸随身带了一副观剧望远镜，最新的时尚也是强烈反对使用它的——更何况我根本没带——因此我很绝望。","I revolved in my mind a thousand schemes by which I might obtain, hereafter, an introduction to the elder lady, or, for the present, at all events, a more distinct view of her beauty.I would have removed my position to one nearer her own, but the crowded state of the theatre rendered this impossible; and the stern decrees of Fashion had, of late, imperatively prohibited the use of the opera-glass in a case such as this, even had I been so fortunate as to have one with me—but I had not—and was thus in despair."
"我经过深思熟虑，决定求助于同伴。","At length I bethought me of applying to my companion."
"“塔尔博特，”我说，“你带着观剧望远镜吧。请让我用一下。”","“Talbot,” I said, “you have an opera-glass.Let me have it.”"
"“观剧望远镜？没有！你觉得我带一个观剧望远镜做什么？”然后他不耐烦地把头转向了舞台。","“An opera-glass!—no!—what do you suppose I would be doing with an opera-glass?”Here he turned impatiently toward the stage."
"我扳过他的肩膀，继续说：“塔尔博特，请听我说，好吗？你看到舞台前的包厢了吗？——那儿！——不，是隔壁那个——你看到过这么漂亮的女人吗？”","“But, Talbot,” I continued, pulling him by the shoulder, “listen to me will you?Do you see the stage-box?—there!—no, the next.—did you ever behold as lovely a woman?”"
"“毫无疑问，她非常漂亮。”他说。","“She is very beautiful, no doubt.” he said."
"“我想知道她是谁。”","“I wonder who she can be.”"
"“众天使在上，你竟然不知道她是谁？‘不知道她说明你是无名小卒。’她可是赫赫有名的拉郎德夫人——当今的绝代佳人，整个城里都在讨论她。她还非常富有，是个寡妇，也是个绝佳的配偶，刚从巴黎来。”","“Why, in the name of all that is angelic, don’t you know who she is?‘Not to know her argues yourself unknown.’She is the celebrated Madame Lalande—the beauty of the day par excellence, and the talk of the whole town.Immensely wealthy too—a widow, and a great match—has just arrived from Paris.”"
"“你认识她吗？”","“Do you know her?”"
"“是的，我有此荣幸。”","“Yes; I have the honor.”"
"“可以把我介绍给她吗？”","“Will you introduce me?”"
"“当然，非常乐意，那什么时候呢？”","“Assuredly, with the greatest pleasure; when shall it be?”"
"“明天，一点钟，到时我会去B公寓拜访你。”","“Tomorrow, at one, I will call upon you at B—’s.”"
"“很好。如果可以的话，请你现在别再说话了。”","“Very good; and now do hold your tongue, if you can.”"
"考虑到他所说的后半句话，我不得不接受了塔尔博特的建议。因为在剩下的时间里，他固执地不听我提出的任何问题或意见，一直在全神贯注地欣赏着舞台上的演出。","In this latter respect I was forced to take Talbot’s advice; for he remained obstinately deaf to every further question or suggestion, and occupied himself exclusively for the rest of the evening with what was transacting upon the stage."
"这期间，我一直紧紧盯着拉朗德夫人。最后，我终于有幸正面欣赏了她的整张脸。这是一张精致的脸——当然之前我就是这么想的，尽管塔尔博特没有告诉我这一点——但是仍然有一种莫名其妙的东西让我感到不安。最后我发现自己强烈地感觉到了一种严肃、悲伤的神情，更确切地说，是疲倦的神情。这使得她的容颜没那么有青春活力，而是带着一种天使般的温柔和端庄。当然，对于我热情而浪漫的性情来说，这更具有十倍的吸引力。","In the meantime I kept my eyes riveted on Madame Lalande, and at length had the good fortune to obtain a full front view of her face.It was exquisitely lovely—this, of course, my heart had told me before, even had not Talbot fully satisfied me upon the point—but still the unintelligible something disturbed me.I finally concluded that my senses were impressed by a certain air of gravity, sadness, or, still more properly, of weariness, which took something from the youth and freshness of the countenance, only to endow it with a seraphic tenderness and majesty, and thus, of course, to my enthusiastic and romantic temperment, with an interest tenfold."
"正当我大饱眼福时，让我非常不安的事情终于发生了，我看到她吃了一惊，尽管这并不易察觉，我知道她突然意识到了我灼热的目光。我依旧着迷地看着她，无法收回目光，哪怕一瞬间也不行。她的脸转向一边，我又只能看到她后脑勺那清晰的轮廓。过了几分钟，似乎是出于好奇想看看我是否还在盯着她，她慢慢地转过头来，又一次撞上了我灼热的目光。她乌黑的大眼睛立刻垂了下来，脸颊上涌上一抹深深的红晕。但是我吃惊地看到，她不仅没有再次把头偏过去，而且还从腰间拿出一副眼镜——举起来——调了调——然后刻意地透过它全神贯注地观察了我几分钟。","While I thus feasted my eyes, I perceived, at last, to my great trepidation, by an almost imperceptible start on the part of the lady, that she had become suddenly aware of the intensity of my gaze.Still, I was absolutely fascinated, and could not withdraw it, even for an instant.She turned aside her face, and again I saw only the chiselled contour of the back portion of the head.After some minutes, as if urged by curiosity to see if I was still looking, she gradually brought her face again around and again encountered my burning gaze.Her large dark eyes fell instantly, and a deep blush mantled her cheek.But what was my astonishment at perceiving that she not only did not a second time avert her head, but that she actually took from her girdle a double eyeglass—elevated it—adjusted it—and then regarded me through it, intently and deliberately, for the space of several minutes."
"即使是一个霹雳炸到了我的脚上，我也不会更加吃惊——仅仅是吃惊——丝毫没有厌恶和反感，尽管这么放肆的举动放在其他女人身上可能会让人厌恶和反感。但是她所有的举动都那么冷静——那么自然——那么镇定——明显透露出她极高的修养。总之，丝毫看不到厚颜无耻的影子，我所有的感觉就是钦佩和惊讶。","Had a thunderbolt fallen at my feet I could not have been more thoroughly astounded—astounded only—not offended or disgusted in the slightest degree; although an action so bold in any other woman would have been likely to offend or disgust.But the whole thing was done with so much quietude—so much nonchalance—so much repose—with so evident an air of the highest breeding, in short—that nothing of mere effrontery was perceptible, and my sole sentiments were those of admiration and surprise."
"我注意到，她第一次举起眼镜观察了我一会儿，似乎很满意，就放下了眼镜，然后像是突然又想起了什么，又拿起眼镜，继续目不转睛地观察了我几分钟——我敢肯定至少有五分钟。","I observed that, upon her first elevation of the glass, she had seemed satisfied with a momentary inspection of my person, and was withdrawing the instrument, when, as if struck by a second thought, she resumed it, and so continued to regard me with fixed attention for the space of several minutes—for five minutes, at the very least, I am sure."
"这一举动在一家美国剧院里是如此惹眼，以至于吸引了很多人的目光，引起了一阵微妙的骚动，或是窃窃私语。这让我一时感到不知所措，但拉朗德夫人的面部表情却没有受到丝毫影响。","This action, so remarkable in an American theatre, attracted very general observation, and gave rise to an indefinite movement, or buzz, among the audience, which for a moment filled me with confusion, but produced no visible effect upon the countenance of Madame Lalande."
"满足了她的好奇心之后——如果真的是好奇心的话——她放下眼镜，又静静地把注意力转向舞台，像以前一样只留给我一个侧面。我继续毫不间断地看着她，尽管我已经完全意识到这样做是很鲁莽的。随后，我看到她的头缓缓地稍稍转变了方向。很快我就确信她在假装在看着舞台，其实是在专注地观察我。这么迷人的女士的这种举动对我兴奋的心情带来的影响无需多言。","Having satisfied her curiosity—if such it was—she dropped the glass, and quietly gave her attention again to the stage; her profile now being turned toward myself, as before.I continued to watch her unremittingly, although I was fully conscious of my rudeness in so doing.Presently I saw the head slowly and slightly change its position; and soon I became convinced that the lady, while pretending to look at the stage was, in fact, attentively regarding myself.It is needless to say what effect this conduct, on the part of so fascinating a woman, had upon my excitable mind."
"我深爱的美人如此仔细观察了我大概有一刻钟，然后开始同陪伴她的那位绅士说话。从他们的眼神中我明显看出他们的谈话与我有关。","Having thus scrutinized me for perhaps a quarter of an hour, the fair object of my passion addressed the gentleman who attended her, and while she spoke, I saw distinctly, by the glances of both, that the conversation had reference to myself."
"之后，拉朗德夫人又把头转向了舞台。有那么几分钟，她似乎陶醉在表演之中。但是这几分钟过去之后，我看到她第二次打开挂在腰间的眼镜，带着令我的灵魂又兴奋又迷惑的镇定神情，像上次那样正视着我，从头到脚把我重新打量了一番，完全没有顾及观众中再次的窃窃私语，这让我陷入了极度的兴奋之中。","Upon its conclusion, Madame Lalande again turned toward the stage, and, for a few minutes, seemed absorbed in the performance.At the expiration of this period, however, I was thrown into an extremity of agitation by seeing her unfold, for the second time, the eye-glass which hung at her side, fully confront me as before, and, disregarding the renewed buzz of the audience, survey me, from head to foot, with the same miraculous composure which had previously so delighted and confounded my soul."
"这一不同寻常的举动让我再次陷入极度的兴奋之中——陷入疯狂的迷恋之中——这没有让我不安，反而给予了我勇气。在这种狂热的爱恋之中，我忘记了一切，脑海里只有这位正与我对视的绝色佳人，只有她的存在、她的无比可爱。在我认为观众都完全陶醉于歌剧之中的时候，我终于抓住了机会，捕捉住了拉朗德夫人的双眼，准确无误地向她轻轻鞠了一躬。","This extraordinary behavior, by throwing me into a perfect fever of excitement—into an absolute delirium of love—served rather to embolden than to disconcert me.In the mad intensity of my devotion, I forgot everything but the presence and the majestic loveliness of the vision which confronted my gaze.Watching my opportunity, when I thought the audience were fully engaged with the opera, I at length caught the eyes of Madame Lalande, and, upon the instant, made a slight but unmistakable bow."
"她满脸绯红——然后移开了目光——慢慢地、小心翼翼地向四周看了看，明显是在看我这一鲁莽的举动是否引起了他人的注意——然后转向坐在她旁边的那位绅士。","She blushed very deeply—then averted her eyes—then slowly and cautiously looked around, apparently to see if my rash action had been noticed—then leaned over toward the gentleman who sat by her side."
"我现在强烈地感到自己刚才的举动是多么不得体，觉得那会被人立刻发现。这时，我马上忐忑不安地想到明天会有几把手枪射穿我的脑袋。不过，当我看到这位女士什么也没说，只是给了那位绅士一张节目单时，我立刻如释重负。很快，她又偷偷环顾了一下四周，把明亮的双眼完全定格在了我身上，然后她微微笑了笑，露出了一排珍珠般洁白、闪亮的牙齿，带着一种显然是肯定的神情对着我明确地点了两下头，读者也许已经稍稍感到了我的惊讶——我深深的错愕——我心里的慌乱不安。","I now felt a burning sense of the impropriety I had committed, and expected nothing less than instant exposure; while a vision of pistols upon the morrow floated rapidly and uncomfortably through my brain.I was greatly and immediately relieved, however, when I saw the lady merely hand the gentleman a play-bill, without speaking, but the reader may form some feeble conception of my astonishment—of my profound amazement—my delirious bewilderment of heart and soul—when, instantly afterward, having again glanced furtively around, she allowed her bright eyes to set fully and steadily upon my own, and then, with a faint smile, disclosing a bright line of her pearly teeth, made two distinct, pointed, and unequivocal affirmative inclinations of the head."
"当然，我无需详细描述我的喜悦——我的激动——我心中无限的狂喜。如果有人因过度兴奋而发疯，那就是当时的我。我恋爱了。这是我的初恋——我感觉这就是。这是爱情的最高境界——无法用语言形容。这就是“一见钟情”，而且第一眼就被对方领会，并得到了回应。","It is useless, of course, to dwell upon my joy—upon my transport—upon my illimitable ecstasy of heart.If ever man was mad with excess of happiness, it was myself at that moment.I loved.This was my first love—so I felt it to be.It was love supreme—indescribable.It was “love at first sight;” and at first sight, too, it had been appreciated and returned."
"是的，她回应我了。我为什么、又怎么会对此有片刻的怀疑呢？像拉朗德夫人这样美丽——这样富有——这样优雅——这样高贵——这样显赫——在我看来各方面都值得尊敬的女士做出了这样的举动，我还能有什么其他的解释吗？是的，她爱我——她回应了我炽热的爱，她的这种激情像我一样是盲目的——坚定的——单纯的——大胆的——而且完全无拘无束的！演出落幕了，打断了我甜蜜的幻想和回味。观众们站了起来，剧场里立刻像以往一样混乱了起来。我马上离开塔尔博特，竭尽全力在人群中挤着想靠近拉朗德夫人。实在是太拥挤了，我没能靠近她，最终我还是放弃了，转身踏上了回家的路。因为连她的石榴裙边也没有碰到，我感到很失望，但想到明天塔尔博特会正式把我介绍给她，我感到了些许的安慰。","Yes, returned.How and why should I doubt it for an instant?What other construction could I possibly put upon such conduct, on the part of a lady so beautiful—so wealthy—evidently so accomplished—of so high breeding—of so lofty a position in society—in every regard so entirely respectable as I felt assured was Madame Lalande?Yes, she loved me—she returned the enthusiasm of my love, with an enthusiasm as blind—as uncompromising—as uncalculating—as abandoned—and as utterly unbounded as my own!These delicious fancies and reflections, however, were now interrupted by the falling of the drop-curtain.The audience arose; and the usual tumult immediately supervened.Quitting Talbot abruptly, I made every effort to force my way into closer proximity with Madame Lalande.Having failed in this, on account of the crowd, I at length gave up the chase, and bent my steps homeward; consoling myself for my disappointment in not having been able to touch even the hem of her robe, by the reflection that I should be introduced by Talbot, in due form, upon the morrow."
"明天终于来了，也就是说，经过一夜漫长、煎熬、焦灼的等待之后，新的一天终于降临了。之后直到一点钟的那段时间慢得像蜗牛一般，单调乏味而无休无止。但是人们都说即使斯坦布尔之路也有尽头，这漫长的等待终于结束了。一点钟的钟声敲响了。钟声的回音终于停止了，我走进了B公寓，寻找塔尔博特。","This morrow at last came, that is to say, a day finally dawned upon a long and weary night of impatience; and then the hours until “one” were snail-paced, dreary, and innumerable.But even Stamboul, it is said, shall have an end, and there came an end to this long delay.The clock struck.As the last echo ceased, I stepped into B—’s and inquired for Talbot."
"“出去了。”塔尔博特的一个仆人说。","“Out,” said the footman—Talbot’s own."
"“出去了！”我回应道，踉跄地向后退了几步，“告诉你吧，好伙计，这是绝对不可能的，也是不符合实际情况的。塔尔博特肯定在家。你这样说是什么意思？”","“Out!” I replied, staggering back half a dozen paces—“let me tell you, my fine fellow, that this thing is thoroughly impossible and impracticable; Mr. Talbot is not out.What do you mean?”"
"“没什么，先生，我只是说塔尔博特不在家，仅此而已。他吃完早饭就骑马去了S那里，留下话说一个星期后才回来。”","“Nothing, sir; only Mr. Talbot is not in, that’s all.He rode over to S—, immediately after breakfast, and left word that he would not be in town again for a week.”"
"我傻傻地站在那里，满心憎恶和愤怒。我试图回话，但舌头却不听使唤。最后我转过身，脸色由于愤怒而发青，在内心里把塔尔博特的整个家族都发配到了埃里伯斯最偏远的地区。很明显，我这位体贴周到的朋友，这位音乐迷，已经完全忘了和我之间的约定——一说出口就忘了。他从来都不是个遵守诺言的人。但是没什么办法了，我一边尽可能地平息心中的怒火，一边郁闷地在街上闲逛，向遇到的每一个认识的男子打听拉朗德夫人，但都一无所获。据他们说，我发现所有人都知道她——许多人见过她——但是她来这个城市才几个星期，因此只有很少几个人声称和她有私交。但是就算是这很少的几个人和她的关系也比较生疏，他们不愿意，或者说也不可能冒昧地通过早上拜访的形式把我介绍给她。我就那样绝望地站在那里，和三个朋友谈论着萦绕在我心中的话题，这时话题的主角碰巧从我们身旁经过。","I stood petrified with horror and rage.I endeavored to reply, but my tongue refused its office.At length I turned on my heel, livid with wrath, and inwardly consigning the whole tribe of the Talbots to the innermost regions of Erebus.It was evident that my considerate friend, il fanatico, had quite forgotten his appointment with myself—had forgotten it as soon as it was made.At no time was he a very scrupulous man of his word.There was no help for it; so smothering my vexation as well as I could, I strolled moodily up the street, propounding futile inquiries about Madame Lalande to every male acquaintance I met.By report she was known, I found, to all—to many by sight—but she had been in town only a few weeks, and there were very few, therefore, who claimed her personal acquaintance.These few, being still comparatively strangers, could not, or would not, take the liberty of introducing me through the formality of a morning call.While I stood thus in despair, conversing with a trio of friends upon the all absorbing subject of my heart, it so happened that the subject itself passed by."
"“的确，那就是她！”一个朋友高呼。","“As I live, there she is!” cried one. "
"“美得惊人！”另一个朋友感叹道。　","“Surprisingly beautiful!” exclaimed a second. "
"“简直就是天使下凡！”第三个朋友尖叫道。","“An angel upon earth!” ejaculated a third. "
"我望过去，只见一辆敞篷马车沿着街道缓缓地向我们驶来，马车里坐着歌剧院里那位绝色佳人，还是由包厢里那位比她年轻的女士陪着。","I looked; and in an open carriage which approached us, passing slowly down the street, sat the enchanting vision of the opera, accompanied by the younger lady who had occupied a portion of her box."
"“她同伴的穿着也是如此品位不凡。”三个朋友中刚刚最先开口的那一个说道。","“Her companion also wears remarkably well.” said the one of my trio who had spoken first."
"“太令人惊讶了，”第二个朋友说，“也是光彩照人，艺术真能创造奇迹。要我说，她看起来比五年前在巴黎时更加漂亮了。还是那么美——你觉得不是吗，弗鲁瓦萨尔？——辛普森，我是说你。”","“Astonishingly,” said the second, “still quite a brilliant air, but art will do wonders.Upon my word, she looks better than she did at Paris five years ago.A beautiful woman still,—don’t you think so, Froissart?—Simpson, I mean.”"
"“还是那么美！”我说，“她凭什么会不美呢？但是她和她的朋友在一起就好比灯芯草蜡烛遇到了夜晚的明星——萤火虫遇到了心宿二。”","“Still!” said I, “and why shouldn’t she be?But compared with her friend she is as a rush-light to the evening star—a glow-worm to Antares.”"
"“哈！哈！哈！——好啊，辛普森，你真是才思敏捷、善于发现——我是说这些比喻真新颖。”","“Ha! ha! ha!—why, Simpson, you have an astonishing tact at making discoveries—original ones, I mean.”"
"说到这里，我们就分道扬镳了，有一个朋友开始哼唱一支欢快的轻音乐剧，我只听到了这几句：","And here we separated, while one of the trio began humming a gay vaudeville, of which I caught only the lines—"
"尼农，尼农，尼农倒在地上——","Ninon, Ninon, Ninon a bas—"
"尼农·德兰克劳斯倒在地上！","A bas Ninon De L’Enclos!"
"这一幕上演时，还是有一件事大大安慰了我，尽管它又激起了原先吞噬我的激情。拉朗德夫人的马车匆匆经过我们时，我注意到她认出了我。不仅如此，她还赐予了我所能想见的最纯洁的微笑，明确地表达了对我的认可。","During this little scene, however, one thing had served greatly to console me, although it fed the passion by which I was consumed.As the carriage of Madame Lalande rolled by our group, I had observed that she recognized me; and more than this, she had blessed me, by the most seraphic of all imaginable smiles, with no equivocal mark of the recognition."
"至于引见这件事，在塔尔博特从山村回来之前我不得不放弃了所有的希望。同时，我坚持不懈地频繁光顾那些著名的公共娱乐场所。最终在我第一次见到她的那个剧院里，我又极为荣幸地遇到了她，并再次四目相对。但这已经是两个星期后的事情了。在此期间，我每天都去塔尔博特的寓所问他回来没有，他的男仆的回答永远是“还没回来呢”，这话气得我浑身抽搐。","As for an introduction, I was obliged to abandon all hope of it until such time as Talbot should think proper to return from the country.In the meantime I perseveringly frequented every reputable place of public amusement; and, at length, at the theatre, where I first saw her, I had the supreme bliss of meeting her, and of exchanging glances with her once again.This did not occur, however, until the lapse of a fortnight.Every day, in the interim, I had inquired for Talbot at his hotel, and every day had been thrown into a spasm of wrath by the everlasting “Not come home yet” of his footman."
"到了我刚刚提到的那个晚上，我都快要疯掉了。别人告诉我，拉朗德夫人是巴黎人——最近才从巴黎过来，她会不会突然回去呢？——在塔尔博特回来之前就回去——这样我岂不是要永远失去她了吗？我无法承受这种可怕的想法。因为这关系到我未来的幸福，我做了一个很男人的决定，并决心付诸行动。总之，演出结束之后，我跟踪她到了她的住所，并记下了地址。第二天早上我向她寄去了一封热情洋溢、内容详尽的书信，在信中吐露了我全部的心声。","Upon the evening in question, therefore, I was in a condition little short of madness.Madame Lalande, I had been told, was a Parisian—had lately arrived from Paris—might she not suddenly return?—return before Talbot came back—and might she not be thus lost to me forever?The thought was too terrible to bear.Since my future happiness was at issue, I resolved to act with a manly decision.In a word, upon the breaking up of the play, I traced the lady to her residence, noted the address, and the next morning sent her a full and elaborate letter, in which I poured out my whole heart."
"我大胆地、无所顾忌地倾诉着——总之，我在倾诉时充满了激情。我毫无保留——甚至包括我的缺点。我委婉地提到了我们第一次见面的浪漫情景——甚至提到了我们之间的眉目传情。我甚至还说，我确信她也爱我，同时我对她怀有深深的爱慕之情，这两点算是对我不可原谅的行为的辩解。另外，我提到自己的担忧，怕还没来得及被正式引见给她，她就离开了这座城市。最后，我坦白了我的生活状况——我的富有——并说我愿意全身心地为她付出，并以此结束了这封我所写过的最饱含深情的长信。","I spoke boldly, freely—in a word, I spoke with passion.I concealed nothing—nothing even of my weakness.I alluded to the romantic circumstances of our first meeting—even to the glances which had passed between us.I went so far as to say that I felt assured of her love; while I offered this assurance, and my own intensity of devotion, as two excuses for my otherwise unpardonable conduct.As a third, I spoke of my fear that she might quit the city before I could have the opportunity of a formal introduction.I concluded the most wildly enthusiastic epistle ever penned, with a frank declaration of my worldly circumstances—of my affluence—and with an offer of my heart and of my hand."
"我痛苦地、充满期待地等待着回信。似乎是过了一个世纪之后我才收到回信。","In an agony of expectation I awaited the reply.After what seemed the lapse of a century it came."
"是的，信真的来了。这一切看上去很浪漫，我真的收到了一封来自拉朗德夫人的信——这位漂亮的、富有的、偶像般的拉朗德夫人。她的眼睛——她那流光溢彩的眼睛，并没有掩盖她那颗高贵的心。她确实像一个真正的法国女人，办事理性又率直——天性慷慨而冲动——鄙视世俗的传统礼数。她没有嘲笑我的求爱。她没有以沉默自我保护。她没有原封不动地退回我的信。她甚至给我寄了一封用她纤巧的手指写的信。信是这样写的：","Yes, actually came.Romantic as all this may appear, I really received a letter from Madame Lalande—the beautiful, the wealthy, the idolized Madame Lalande.Her eyes—her magnificent eyes, had not belied her noble heart.Like a true Frenchwoman as she was she had obeyed the frank dictates of her reason—the generous impulses of her nature—despising the conventional pruderies of the world.She had not scorned my proposals.She had not sheltered herself in silence.She had not returned my letter unopened.She had even sent me, in reply, one penned by her own exquisite fingers.It ran thus:"
"“辛普森先生，请原谅我不能用贵国优美的语言写这封信。我最近才来到这里，还没有机会——把它学好。","“Monsieur Simpson vill pardonne me for not compose de butefulle tong of his contree so vell as might.It is only de late dat I am arrive, and not yet ave do opportunite for to—l’etudier."
"“请原谅我以这种方式，我想说的是，唉！——辛普森先生已经猜出了全部实情。我还需要再说什么吗？唉！我是不是已经说得太多了？","“Vid dis apologie for the maniere, I vill now say dat, helas!—Monsieur Simpson ave guess but de too true.Need I say de more?Helas! am I not ready speak de too moshe?"
"“欧仁妮·拉朗德”","“EUGENIE LALAND.”"
"我把这封充满高贵精神的短笺亲吻了上百万次，毫无疑问，由于它，我又做了许多现在已经记不得的疯狂举动。塔尔博特还是没有回来。天啊！他难道丝毫没有想到由于自己的离开，他的朋友承受着多大的痛苦吗？难道他就不能出于同情立刻回来以减轻我的痛苦吗？然而，他还是没有回来。我写信给他。他回复了。他由于紧急事务耽误了，但很快就会回来。他请我耐心些——稳定一下情绪——读一些安慰性的书——不要喝比白葡萄酒更烈的酒——用哲学来安慰自己。这个傻瓜！如果他不能亲自回来，只要他稍微动动头脑，也应该附上一封引见信给我呀！我又给他写了封信，请他立刻给我寄来一封引见信。我的信被那个男仆退了回来，背面用铅笔写着下列文字。这个无赖已经到乡村去找他的主人了。","This noble-spirited note I kissed a million times, and committed, no doubt, on its account, a thousand other extravagances that have now escaped my memory.Still Talbot would not return.Alas! could he have formed even the vaguest idea of the suffering his absence had occasioned his friend, would not his sympathizing nature have flown immediately to my relief?Still, however, he came not.I wrote.He replied.He was detained by urgent business—but would shortly return.He begged me not to be impatient—to moderate my transports—to read soothing books—to drink nothing stronger than Hock—and to bring the consolations of philosophy to my aid.The fool! if he could not come himself, why, in the name of every thing rational, could he not have enclosed me a letter of presentation?I wrote him again, entreating him to forward one forthwith.My letter was returned by that footman, with the following endorsement in pencil.The scoundrel had joined his master in the country:"
"“昨天不知为什么他离开了S——没说去哪里——也没说什么时候回来——因为我认识您的笔迹，知道您一般都很着急，我想最好还是回复您一下。","“Left S—yesterday, for parts unknown—did not say where—or when be back—so thought best to return letter, knowing your handwriting, and as how you is always, more or less, in a hurry."
"您真诚的，","Yours sincerely,"
"斯塔布斯”","STUBBS”"
"看完这封信，毫无疑问我会诅咒主仆二人都下地狱——但是愤怒没什么用，抱怨也根本无济于事。","After this, it is needless to say, that I devoted to the infernal deities both master and valet,—but there was little use in anger, and no consolation at all in complaint."
"但是我还有最后一招，尽管鲁莽却又合乎情理。到目前为止，它都很管用，现在我决定让它继续发挥作用，以达到我的目的。另外，在我们互通信件之后，我能做出的那种不拘礼节而又不越界限的举动还会被拉朗德夫人认为是失礼吗？自从信件往来之后，我便一直习惯于观察她的住宅，因此发现她爱在黄昏时分在她窗口俯瞰的那个公共广场散步，仅由一个穿制服的黑奴陪伴着。在这片繁茂、阴翳的小树林里，在仲夏夜那朦胧的阴影里，我看准时机，上前和她搭讪。","But I had yet a resource left, in my constitutional audacity.Hitherto it had served me well, and I now resolved to make it avail me to the end.Besides, after the correspondence which had passed between us, what act of mere informality could I commit, within bounds, that ought to be regarded as indecorous by Madame Lalande?Since the affair of the letter, I had been in the habit of watching her house, and thus discovered that, about twilight, it was her custom to promenade, attended only by a negro in livery, in a public square overlooked by her windows.Here, amid the luxuriant and shadowing groves, in the gray gloom of a sweet midsummer evening, I observed my opportunity and accosted her."
"我想最好要骗过那个随从的仆人，于是我装出一副老熟人那自信十足的样子。她不愧是个真正的巴黎人，立刻心领神会，伸出了那双纤纤玉手来欢迎我。仆人立刻退到了后面，现在我们的内心激情澎湃，长时间地、毫无保留地谈论着我们之间的爱情。","The better to deceive the servant in attendance, I did this with the assured air of an old and familiar acquaintance.With a presence of mind truly Parisian, she took the cue at once, and, to greet me, held out the most bewitchingly little of hands.The valet at once fell into the rear, and now, with hearts full to overflowing, we discoursed long and unreservedly of our love."
"由于拉朗德夫人的英语说得甚至还没有写得好，所以我们的谈话必须要用法语。在这最适合表达激情的甜美语言中，我任由自己生来冲动的激情自由驰骋，并且以自己能言善辩的口才请求她立刻嫁给我。","As Madame Lalande spoke English even less fluently than she wrote it, our conversation was necessarily in French.In this sweet tongue, so adapted to passion, I gave loose to the impetuous enthusiasm of my nature, and, with all the eloquence I could command, besought her to consent to an immediate marriage."
"对于我的急不可耐，她微微一笑。她力劝我要言行得体——这种老套的话就像一只怪物，剥夺了许多人的幸福，让他们最终错失了获得幸福的良机。她注意到我很鲁莽，让我的所有朋友都知道我想要认识她——却未能如愿以偿——所以根本不可能隐瞒这一次我们初次相识的约会。然后，她又脸红了，转而说这次约会实在太仓促了。立刻结婚是不妥当的——不合礼节的——也有点荒唐。她说这话时带着一种天真的迷人神情，她言之有理的话让我有点痛苦，让我以为言之有理，却又让我心花怒放。她甚至笑着责怪我的鲁莽——我的冲动。她请我不要忘记我其实还不知道她是谁——她有什么打算、她的亲戚关系、她的社会地位。她叹了口气，请求我重新考虑考虑我的求婚，并把我的这种爱称为痴迷——一种心血来潮——一时的想入非非——与其说是发自内心，不如说是出于幻想的一种毫无根据、毫不牢靠的产物。她说这些话的时候，迷人的暮色中的阴影正渐渐暗淡，把我们环抱在中间——然后，她用天仙般的玉手指轻轻推了一下，只一刹那就推翻了她先前在我心中编织的信念。","At this impatience she smiled.She urged the old story of decorum—that bug-bear which deters so many from bliss until the opportunity for bliss has forever gone by.I had most imprudently made it known among my friends, she observed, that I desired her acquaintance—thus that I did not possess it—thus, again, there was no possibility of concealing the date of our first knowledge of each other.And then she adverted, with a blush, to the extreme recency of this date.To wed immediately would be improper—would be indecorous—would be outre.All this she said with a charming air of naivete which enraptured while it grieved and convinced me.She went even so far as to accuse me, laughingly, of rashness—of imprudence.She bade me remember that I really even know not who she was—what were her prospects, her connections, her standing in society.She begged me, but with a sigh, to reconsider my proposal, and termed my love an infatuation—a will o’ the wisp—a fancy or fantasy of the moment—a baseless and unstable creation rather of the imagination than of the heart.These things she uttered as the shadows of the sweet twilight gathered darkly and more darkly around us—and then, with a gentle pressure of her fairy-like hand, overthrew, in a single sweet instant, all the argumentative fabric she had reared."
"我极力为自己辩解——像一个真正的恋人会做的那样。我说了很久，坚持不懈地表达了我的爱，我的激情——她那超凡脱俗的美，和我自己充满激情的爱慕。总之，以我的雄辩口才，我详细讲述了爱情之路上的艰险——真爱之路从来都是不平坦的——因此可以推断，过长的恋爱过程显然充满了危险。","I replied as best I could—as only a true lover can.I spoke at length, and perseveringly of my devotion, of my passion—of her exceeding beauty, and of my own enthusiastic admiration.In conclusion, I dwelt, with a convincing energy, upon the perils that encompass the course of love—that course of true love that never did run smooth—and thus deduced the manifest danger of rendering that course unnecessarily long."
"后来的话似乎终于动摇了她坚定的心。她温和了下来，但是她说还有一个障碍，她确信我对这点没有认真地考虑过。这是一个敏感的话题——对一个女士来说尤其如此。她明白要谈论这个话题就必须牺牲自己的感受。但是，为了我，一切牺牲都是应该的。她委婉地提到了年龄的问题。我意识到了吗——我充分意识到了我们之间的年龄差距了吗？世人都认为丈夫的年龄比妻子大——甚至大上十五或二十岁——都是可以接受的，甚至是合适的，但是她过去一直认为妻子的年龄绝不应该超过丈夫的年龄。天啊！这种不自然的差距总是会带来不幸的生活。","This latter argument seemed finally to soften the rigor of her determination.She relented; but there was yet an obstacle, she said, which she felt assured I had not properly considered.This was a delicate point—for a woman to urge, especially so; in mentioning it, she saw that she must make a sacrifice of her feelings; still, for me, every sacrifice should be made.She alluded to the topic of age.Was I aware—was I fully aware of the discrepancy between us?That the age of the husband, should surpass by a few years—even by fifteen or twenty—the age of the wife, was regarded by the world as admissible, and, indeed, as even proper, but she had always entertained the belief that the years of the wife should never exceed in number those of the husband.A discrepancy of this unnatural kind gave rise, too frequently, alas! to a life of unhappiness. "
"现在她知道我的年龄不超过二十二岁，而我，也许恰恰相反，并不知道我的欧仁妮的年龄远远超过了二十二岁。","Now she was aware that my own age did not exceed two and twenty; and I, on the contrary, perhaps, was not aware that the years of my Eugenie extended very considerably beyond that sum."
"所有这些都透露着一种灵魂的高尚——一种坦率的高贵——这使我高兴——令我心醉神迷——并永远地锁住了我。我几乎无法控制满心的狂喜。","About all this there was a nobility of soul—a dignity of candor—which delighted—which enchanted me—which eternally riveted my chains.I could scarcely restrain the excessive transport which possessed me."
"“我最可爱的欧仁妮，”我大声说道，“你在说些什么呢？在某种程度上，你是比我大。但那又怎么样？世间的风俗有如此多循规蹈矩的荒唐事。对那些像我们一样彼此深爱的人来说，一年和一个小时又有什么差别呢？的确，你可以说我是二十二岁。事实上，很快你就可以说我二十三岁了。那么你自己，我最亲爱的欧仁妮，最多不超过——不超过——不超过——超过——过——过——”","“My sweetest Eugenie,” I cried, “what is all this about which you are discoursing?Your years surpass in some measure my own.But what then?The customs of the world are so many conventional follies.To those who love as ourselves, in what respect differs a year from an hour?I am twenty-two, you say, granted: indeed, you may as well call me, at once, twenty-three.Now you yourself, my dearest Eugenie, can have numbered no more than—can have numbered no more than—no more than—than—than—than—”"
"这里我停顿了一会儿，期望拉朗德夫人会打断我，告诉我她的真实年龄。但是法国女人很少会那么直接了当，而且在回答一个令人尴尬的问题时，她们常常会自己用一些实际行动来作为答复。就目前的情况来说，欧仁妮刚才似乎在她的怀里寻找什么东西。最后，一个袖珍画像掉在了草地上，我立刻捡起来奉还给她。","Here I paused for an instant, in the expectation that Madame Lalande would interrupt me by supplying her true age.But a Frenchwoman is seldom direct, and has always, by way of answering to an embarrassing query, some little practical reply of her own.In the present instance, Eugenie, who for a few moments past had seemed to be searching for something in her bosom, at length let fall upon the grass a miniature, which I immediately picked up and presented to her."
"“收藏着吧！”她带着令人着迷的微笑说道，“为了我——为了被它过度美化的人——收藏着吧。另外，在这小东西的背面你也许会发现你似乎正想知道的信息。当然，现在天色很晚了——你可以早上有时间的时候再仔细看。同时，你今晚要护送我回家。我的朋友们正打算举办一场小小的音乐晚会。我可以向你承诺，到时候会有优美动听的歌曲。我们法国人不像你们美国人那样小心谨慎，我会把你以一个老朋友的身份偷偷带进去，这毫无困难。”","“Keep it!” she said, with one of her most ravishing smiles.“Keep it for my sake—for the sake of her whom it too flatteringly represents.Besides, upon the back of the trinket you may discover, perhaps, the very information you seem to desire.It is now, to be sure, growing rather dark—but you can examine it at your leisure in the morning.In the meantime, you shall be my escort home tonight.My friends are about holding a little musical levee.I can promise you, too, some good singing.We French are not nearly so punctilious as you Americans, and I shall have no difficulty in smuggling you in, in the character of an old acquaintance.”"
"说着，她挽上了我的胳膊，然后我送她到了家。庄园非常漂亮，而且我相信庄园的装饰也很有品位。不过我却没什么资格去评判装饰的好坏，因为我们到达的时候天色已晚。在夏天的热浪中，美国较好的庄园很少在一天里最舒适的时间里灯火通明，很少展现出真实面目。在我到达后的一个小时，主客厅里只亮起了一盏带灯罩的太阳灯，因此我可以看到这间寓所布置得品位不凡，甚至可以称得上是富丽堂皇。但是整个晚上，套房里的其他两个房间却一直笼罩在宜人的阴影中，而人们主要聚集在那里。这是一种精心的设计，使得宴会至少有了光亮和朦胧两种选择，那些来自大洋彼岸的朋友们只会立刻采纳它。","With this, she took my arm, and I attended her home.The mansion was quite a fine one, and, I believe, furnished in good taste.Of this latter point, however, I am scarcely qualified to judge; for it was just dark as we arrived; and in American mansions of the better sort lights seldom, during the heat of summer, make their appearance at this, the most pleasant period of the day.In about an hour after my arrival, to be sure, a single shaded solar lamp was lit in the principal drawing-room; and this apartment, I could thus see, was arranged with unusual good taste and even splendor; but two other rooms of the suite, and in which the company chiefly assembled, remained, during the whole evening, in a very agreeable shadow.This is a well-conceived custom, giving the party at least a choice of light or shade, and one which our friends over the water could not do better than immediately adopt."
"因此，毫无疑问，这个夜晚是我一生中度过的最美好的夜晚。拉朗德夫人没有高估她朋友的音乐才能，我从来没有在维也纳以外的私人圈子里听到过比这更加美妙的音乐。乐器表演者很多，而且个个才华横溢。歌手们主要是女士，每个人演唱得都不是一般的好。最后，传来一声断然的“拉朗德夫人”，她立刻从我身边的躺椅上站了起来，不带任何做作和犹豫，在一两个绅士和一起看歌剧的那位女性朋友的陪同下，到了主客厅的钢琴前。我本打算陪她过去，但又想到我被带进来时的情况，觉得最好还是默默地坐在这里。　　　　因此，我只能享受听的乐趣，却被剥夺了看她唱歌的乐趣。","The evening thus spent was unquestionably the most delicious of my life.Madame Lalande had not overrated the musical abilities of her friends; and the singing I here heard I had never heard excelled in any private circle out of Vienna.The instrumental performers were many and of superior talents.The vocalists were chiefly ladies, and no individual sang less than well.At length, upon a peremptory call for “Madame Lalande,” she arose at once, without affectation or demur, from the chaise longue upon which she had sat by my side, and, accompanied by one or two gentlemen and her female friend of the opera, repaired to the piano in the main drawing-room.I would have escorted her myself, but felt that, under the circumstances of my introduction to the house, I had better remain unobserved where I was.I was thus deprived of the pleasure of seeing, although not of hearing, her sing."
"她的演唱如电流般震惊了人们，但对我来说影响更甚。我不知道该怎样才能充分描述这种感觉。毫无疑问，这种感觉一部分是因为我对她满怀着爱；但主要是因为我深信歌唱者有着极为细腻的感情。她的表演极富激情、气度非凡、咏叹不已。她的表演已经达到了艺术的巅峰。她对《奥赛罗》中浪漫诗句的演绎——演唱《卡普莱特》里“我的墓碑上”这句时的声音——都一直在我的脑海里回荡。她的低音绝对是个奇迹。她的嗓音可以跨越三个八度音阶，从女低音D调到女高音D调，虽然有力地充满了整个圣卡洛斯剧院，却极其精确地唱出了每一个难唱的音符——唱出了所有抑扬顿挫的音阶、韵律和装饰音。在《梦游女》的最后部分，她唱出了下面几句，产生了一种非凡的效果：","The impression she produced upon the company seemed electrical but the effect upon myself was something even more.I know not how adequately to describe it.It arose in part, no doubt, from the sentiment of love with which I was imbued; but chiefly from my conviction of the extreme sensibility of the singer.It is beyond the reach of art to endow either air or recitative with more impassioned expression than was hers.Her utterance of the romance in Otello—the tone with which she gave the words “Sul mio sasso,” in the Capuletti—is ringing in my memory yet.Her lower tones were absolutely miraculous.Her voice embraced three complete octaves, extending from the contralto D to the D upper soprano, and, though sufficiently powerful to have filled the San Carlos, executed, with the minutest precision, every difficulty of vocal composition—ascending and descending scales, cadences, or fiorituri.In the final of the Somnambula, she brought about a most remarkable effect at the words:"
"啊！寻常人怎能揣测","Ah! non guinge uman pensiero"
"我心中充满的喜悦。","Al contento ond ’io son piena."
"这里她模仿了玛丽布兰（注：19世纪西班牙女音乐家），修改了贝利尼（注：19世纪意大利作曲家）的原曲，以便能使她的嗓音降低到次中音G调，然后突然急转，到达超出高音谱的G调，直接跨越了两个八度音阶。","Here, in imitation of Malibran, she modified the original phrase of Bellini, so as to let her voice descend to the tenor G, when, by a rapid transition, she struck the G above the treble stave, springing over an interval of two octaves."
"她的歌声简直就是奇迹。唱完后，她从钢琴边站了起来，回到我身边坐下。我满含热情地向她表达了歌声带给我的愉悦。我没有谈到我的惊讶，尽管我着实非常吃惊，因为我们平时谈话时她的声音有些柔弱，或者可以说是颤颤巍巍的，一点都不坚定，我原以为她唱歌时不会表现出那么非凡的才能。","Upon rising from the piano after these miracles of vocal execution, she resumed her seat by my side; when I expressed to her, in terms of the deepest enthusiasm, my delight at her performance.Of my surprise I said nothing, and yet was I most unfeignedly surprised; for a certain feebleness, or rather a certain tremulous indecision of voice in ordinary conversation, had prepared me to anticipate that, in singing, she would not acquit herself with any remarkable ability."
"我们坦诚地、毫无保留地连续谈了很长时间。她让我讲起了我早期生活的一些片段，并且全神贯注地听着我讲的每一个字。因为她那充满信赖的爱，我毫无隐瞒，觉得有权利告诉她一切。被她在敏感的年龄问题上的坦诚所鼓舞，我非常坦白，不仅详细讲述了我的一些小缺点，还和盘托出了我道德上，乃至身体上的一些缺陷。揭露这些需要很大的勇气，但这更是爱的表现。我提到了上大学时我的鲁莽——我的奢侈——我的玩世不恭——我的债务——我和一些女士的调情史。我甚至还提到了我曾经因为轻微的肺结核性咳嗽而烦恼——提到了慢性风湿病——提到了遗传的痛风。最后还提到了很讨厌、很不便的近视，我至今还在小心地掩盖这个缺点。","Our conversation was now long, earnest, uninterrupted, and totally unreserved.She made me relate many of the earlier passages of my life, and listened with breathless attention to every word of the narrative.I concealed nothing—felt that I had a right to conceal nothing—from her confiding affection.Encouraged by her candor upon the delicate point of her age, I entered, with perfect frankness, not only into a detail of my many minor vices, but made full confession of those moral and even of those physical infirmities, the disclosure of which, in demanding so much higher a degree of courage, is so much surer an evidence of love.I touched upon my college indiscretions—upon my extravagances—upon my carousals—upon my debts—upon my flirtations.I even went so far as to speak of a slightly hectic cough with which, at one time, I had been troubled—of a chronic rheumatism—of a twinge of hereditary gout—and, in conclusion, of the disagreeable and inconvenient, but hitherto carefully concealed, weakness of my eyes."
"“关于后面一点，”拉朗德夫人笑着说，“你坦白这些确实非常不明智，因为如果你不说，我敢讲没有人会揭发你有这种弱点。“顺便说一下，”她继续说道，“你还记不记得——”说到这里，我仿佛透过房间里微弱的灯光看到了一道清晰的绯红涌上她的脸颊。“我亲爱的朋友，你还记得现在挂在我脖子上的这一小只视力辅助器吗？”","“Upon this latter point,” said Madame Lalande, laughingly, “you have been surely injudicious in coming to confession; for, without the confession, I take it for granted that no one would have accused you of the crime.By the by,” she continued, “have you any recollection—” and here I fancied that a blush, even through the gloom of the apartment, became distinctly visible upon her cheek—“have you any recollection, mon cher ami of this little ocular assistant, which now depends from my neck?”"
"她一边说话一边在手指间捏弄着那副有两个相同镜片的眼镜。这副眼镜在歌剧院里曾让我感到非常困惑。","As she spoke she twirled in her fingers the identical double eye-glass which had so overwhelmed me with confusion at the opera."
"“当然记得——哎呀！我记得可清楚了。”我大声说道，同时热情地握住了那只将眼镜递给我看的纤纤玉手。","“Full well—alas! do I remember it,” I exclaimed, pressing passionately the delicate hand which offered the glasses for my inspection."
"它们形成了一个复杂而精美的玩具，带着华丽的镂刻和装饰，上面的宝石闪闪发光。即使在微弱的灯光下，我也禁不住感叹它价值不菲。","They formed a complex and magnificent toy, richly chased and filigreed, and gleaming with jewels, which, even in the deficient light, I could not help perceiving were of high value."
"“好吧！我的朋友，”她继续说道，举止高雅得令我吃惊，“好吧！我的朋友，你曾真诚地要我同意你的请求，还很高兴地将我的认可看作是无价之宝。","“Eh bien! mon ami” she resumed with a certain empressment of manner that rather surprised me—“Eh bien! mon ami, you have earnestly besought of me a favor which you have been pleased to denominate priceless."
"你请求我明天和你结婚。我应该答应你的请求吗——而为了满足我内心的请求，我能多说一句——我有权向你要求一点非常非常小的恩惠作为回报吗？”","You have demanded of me my hand upon the morrow.Should I yield to your entreaties—and, I may add, to the pleadings of my own bosom—would I not be entitled to demand of you a very—a very little boon in return?”"
"“说出来吧！”我用力地大声说道，几乎吸引了周围所有人的目光。因为他们在场，我控制着自己，没有冲动地扑倒在她的石榴裙下。","“Name it!” I exclaimed with an energy that had nearly drawn upon us the observation of the company, and restrained by their presence alone from throwing myself impetuously at her feet."
"“说出来吧，亲爱的，我的欧仁妮，我亲爱的！——说出来吧！——但是，天呀！你还没说出来，我就已经答应了。”","“Name it, my beloved, my Eugenie, my own!—name it!—but, alas! it is already yielded ere named.”"
"“那么，我的朋友，为了你爱的欧仁妮，”她说，“你要战胜，你最后坦诚的缺点——这一缺点更多是道德上的，而不是身体上的——我向你保证，它与你的高贵的真实本质毫不相符——与你坦率的日常性格极不协调——而且，如果放任它进一步发展，你早晚都会陷入某种非常讨厌的困境中。为了我，你要克服这种做作。正如你所说的，它会使你有意无意地拒绝承认自己近视的缺点。你拒绝采用通常的弥补手段。这说明你根本不承认这个缺点。我希望你戴眼镜，你会理解我的——啊，嘘！——为了我，你已经同意戴了。你要接受我手里的小玩具，虽然作为视力的辅助工具而言，它的作用是令人钦佩的，但确实不像钻石那样有巨大的价值。你可以看出，只要稍微调整一下，这样——或者这样——你就可以把它当眼镜戴在眼睛上，或者作为单片眼镜佩戴在马夹口袋里。不过按照习惯，你要用前一种方式佩戴它。为了我，你已经答应要戴了。”","“You shall conquer, then, mon ami,” said she, “for the sake of the Eugenie whom you love, this little weakness which you have at last confessed—this weakness more moral than physical—and which, let me assure you, is so unbecoming the nobility of your real nature—so inconsistent with the candor of your usual character—and which, if permitted further control, will assuredly involve you, sooner or later, in some very disagreeable scrape.You shall conquer, for my sake, this affectation which leads you, as you yourself acknowledge, to the tacit or implied denial of your infirmity of vision.For, this infirmity you virtually deny, in refusing to employ the customary means for its relief.You will understand me to say, then, that I wish you to wear spectacles;—ah, hush!—you have already consented to wear them, for my sake.You shall accept the little toy which I now hold in my hand, and which, though admirable as an aid to vision, is really of no very immense value as a gem.You perceive that, by a trifling modification thus—or thus—it can be adapted to the eyes in the form of spectacles, or worn in the waistcoat pocket as an eye-glass.It is in the former mode, however, and habitually, that you have already consented to wear it for my sake.”"
"这个请求——我是否该承认？——这令我非常困惑。但是它附带的条件使我不可能有半点犹豫。","This request—must I confess it?—confused me in no little degree.But the condition with which it was coupled rendered hesitation, of course, a matter altogether out of the question."
"“好的！”我鼓起了当时所能鼓起的一切激情，大声说道，“好的——我欣然同意。为了你，我愿牺牲一切。今晚我就戴上这只亲爱的眼镜，先作为单片眼镜，戴在我的心口。但在黎明时分请允许我很高兴地称你为妻子，那时我将把它戴在我的——戴在我的鼻子上——从此以后一直戴着它，就像你所希望的那样，虽然不那么浪漫，不那么时尚，却很实用。”","“It is done!” I cried, with all the enthusiasm that I could muster at the moment. “It is done—it is most cheerfully agreed.I sacrifice every feeling for your sake.To-night I wear this dear eye-glass, as an eye-glass, and upon my heart; but with the earliest dawn of that morning which gives me the pleasure of calling you wife, I will place it upon my—upon my nose,—and there wear it ever afterward, in the less romantic, and less fashionable, but certainly in the more serviceable, form which you desire.”"
"现在我们的谈话转向了明天日程的具体安排。我从未婚妻那里了解到，塔尔博特刚刚回到镇上。我要立刻见到他，向他要辆马车。晚会不到两点是不可能结束的，那时马车就会停在门口，因为人群离开时会很混乱，拉朗德夫人可以很轻松地在无人知晓的情况下离开。然后我们会去拜访正在等待的牧师。先在那里结婚，留下塔尔博特，前往东方做短暂的旅行，把花花世界留在家里，任人们评论事情的好坏。","Our conversation now turned upon the details of our arrangements for the morrow.Talbot, I learned from my betrothed, had just arrived in town.I was to see him at once, and procure a carriage.The soiree would scarcely break up before two; and by this hour the vehicle was to be at the door, when, in the confusion occasioned by the departure of the company, Madame L. could easily enter it unobserved.We were then to call at the house of a clergyman who would be in waiting; there be married, drop Talbot, and proceed on a short tour to the East, leaving the fashionable world at home to make whatever comments upon the matter it thought best."
"计划好了一切，我立即离开了，前去寻找塔尔博特。但是在路上，我不由自主地走进了一家旅店，只是为了仔细看看这个袖珍画像，我是用眼镜观察的，它给了我很大的帮助。这真是一张美得无与伦比的脸庞！那双闪闪发光的大眼睛！——那傲然的希腊式鼻子！——那头乌黑浓密的卷发！“啊！”我得意洋洋地自言自语道，“这确实是我爱人，这画面真是栩栩如生！”我翻到背面，发现了这几个字——“欧仁妮·拉朗德——二十七岁零七个月”。","Having planned all this, I immediately took leave, and went in search of Talbot, but, on the way, I could not refrain from stepping into a hotel, for the purpose of inspecting the miniature; and this I did by the powerful aid of the glasses.The countenance was a surpassingly beautiful one!Those large luminous eyes!—that proud Grecian nose!—those dark luxuriant curls!—“Ah!” said I, exultingly to myself, “this is indeed the speaking image of my beloved!”I turned the reverse, and discovered the words—“Eugenie Lalande—aged twenty-seven years and seven months.”"
"我在塔尔博特家找到了他，立刻告诉了他我的好运。他自然显得非常吃惊，却还是由衷地祝福了我，而且愿意尽他所能提供一切帮助。总之，我们的一切都是严格按原计划进行的。凌晨两点，婚礼后的十分钟，我已经和拉朗德夫人——应该说是辛普森夫人——坐上了马车，疾速地驰出了小镇，向东北偏北的方向驶去。","I found Talbot at home, and proceeded at once to acquaint him with my good fortune.He professed excessive astonishment, of course, but congratulated me most cordially, and proffered every assistance in his power.In a word, we carried out our arrangement to the letter, and, at two in the morning, just ten minutes after the ceremony, I found myself in a close carriage with Madame Lalande—with Mrs. Simpson, I should say—and driving at a great rate out of town, in a direction Northeast by North, half-North."
"塔尔博特已经为我们安排好了，因为我们整晚都不会歇着，我们第一站先停在C村，一个离城市二十英里的村庄。我们会在那里吃早饭，稍作休息，然后继续赶路。因此，马车在四点整停在了主客栈的门口。我扶下了我的爱妻，然后立刻点了早餐。同时，我们被带到了一个小客厅里坐了下来。","It had been determined for us by Talbot, that, as we were to be up all night, we should make our first stop at C—, a village about twenty miles from the city, and there get an early breakfast and some repose, before proceeding upon our route.At four precisely, therefore, the carriage drew up at the door of the principal inn.I handed my adored wife out, and ordered breakfast forthwith.In the meantime we were shown into a small parlor, and sat down."
"天就要亮了，却还没有大亮。我着迷地盯着坐在我身边的这个天使，突然产生了一个奇怪的想法：自从我认识著名、美丽的拉朗德夫人以来，这还是我第一次在大白天近距离欣赏她的美貌。","It was now nearly if not altogether daylight; and, as I gazed, enraptured, at the angel by my side, the singular idea came, all at once, into my head, that this was really the very first moment since my acquaintance with the celebrated loveliness of Madame Lalande, that I had enjoyed a near inspection of that loveliness by daylight at all."
"“我的朋友，”她拉着我的手，打断了我的思绪，说道，“好了，我亲爱的朋友，因为我们已经融为一体——因为我已经答应了你强烈的请求，履行了我的诺言——我想你不会忘记你要给我的那一点恩惠——你打算履行的小承诺。啊！让我想想！让我仔细想想！是的，我能很容易地想起你昨晚对欧仁妮作出美丽的承诺时所说的原话。听着！你是这样说的：‘好的！——我欣然同意！为了你，我愿牺牲一切。今晚我就戴上这只亲爱的眼镜，先作为单片眼镜，戴在我的心口。但在黎明时分请允许我很高兴地称你为妻子，那时我将把它戴在我的——戴在我的鼻子上——从此以后一直戴着它，就像你所希望的那样，虽然不那么浪漫，不那么时尚，却很实用。这是你说的原话，我亲爱的丈夫，不是吗？”","“And now, mon ami,” said she, taking my hand, and so interrupting this train of reflection, “and now, mon cher ami, since we are indissolubly one—since I have yielded to your passionate entreaties, and performed my portion of our agreement—I presume you have not forgotten that you also have a little favor to bestow—a little promise which it is your intention to keep.Ah! let me see!Let me remember!Yes; full easily do I call to mind the precise words of the dear promise you made to Eugenie last night.Listen!You spoke thus: ‘It is done!—it is most cheerfully agreed!I sacrifice every feeling for your sake.To-night I wear this dear eye-glass as an eye-glass, and upon my heart; but with the earliest dawn of that morning which gives me the privilege of calling you wife, I will place it upon my—upon my nose,—and there wear it ever afterward, in the less romantic, and less fashionable, but certainly in the more serviceable, form which you desire.’These were the exact words, my beloved husband, were they not?”"
"“是的，”我说，“你记忆力超群。而且我保证，我美丽的欧仁妮，我绝不是不守承诺的人，不会连这点小小的承诺都逃避。看！看啊！它变得——有点——不是吗？”说到这里，我已经把它摆弄成普通眼镜的样子，小心翼翼地戴到了合适的位置上。这时，辛普森夫人整了整帽子，正合拢双臂，笔直地坐在椅子上。她的坐姿有些僵直、呆板，事实上还有些不太雅观。","“They were,” I said; “you have an excellent memory; and assuredly, my beautiful Eugenie, there is no disposition on my part to evade the performance of the trivial promise they imply.See!Behold! they are becoming—rather—are they not?”And here, having arranged the glasses in the ordinary form of spectacles, I applied them gingerly in their proper position; while Madame Simpson, adjusting her cap, and folding her arms, sat bolt upright in her chair, in a somewhat stiff and prim, and indeed, in a somewhat undignified position."
"“我的天哪！”几乎在镜框落在我鼻梁上的一刹那，我就尖叫出来，“天哪！——为什么，这眼镜是怎么了？”我赶紧把它摘下来，拿一块丝绸手帕擦了擦，重新调整了一遍。","“Goodness gracious me!” I exclaimed, almost at the very instant that the rim of the spectacles had settled upon my nose—“My goodness gracious me!—why, what can be the matter with these glasses?” and taking them quickly off, I wiped them carefully with a silk handkerchief, and adjusted them again."
"但是，如果第一次看让我感到吃惊，那么第二次看时，我的吃惊上升到了震惊。这种震惊是如此强烈——无以复加——简直可以说是恐怖。看在一切丑陋事物的份上，这是什么意思？我能相信自己的眼睛吗？——我能吗？——这是个问题。那是——那是——那是胭脂吗？欧仁妮·拉朗德脸上的那些东西是——是——是皱纹吗？天哪！朱庇特，大大小小、男男女女的神啊！她的牙齿那是怎么——怎么——怎么——怎么了？我重重地把眼镜摔到了地上，一跃而起，笔直地站到房子中间，两手叉腰，对辛普森夫人冷笑着，气得勃然大怒。但与此同时，由于惊恐和愤怒，我一个字也说不出来。","But if, in the first instance, there had occurred something which occasioned me surprise, in the second, this surprise became elevated into astonishment; and this astonishment was profound—was extreme—indeed I may say it was horrific.What, in the name of everything hideous, did this mean?Could I believe my eyes?—could I?—that was the question.Was that—was that—was that rouge?And were those—and were those—were those wrinkles, upon the visage of Eugenie Lalande?And oh!Jupiter, and every one of the gods and goddesses, little and big! what—what—what—what had become of her teeth?I dashed the spectacles violently to the ground, and, leaping to my feet, stood erect in the middle of the floor, confronting Mrs. Simpson, with my arms set a-kimbo, and grinning and foaming, but, at the same time, utterly speechless with terror and with rage."
"我之前说过欧仁妮·拉朗德夫人——也就是辛普森夫人——英语说得和写得都不好，也正因如此，她平时总是很得体地不说英语。但是愤怒会让一个女士走极端。在目前的情况下，这愤怒使辛普森夫人做出了极端的事情，她试图用一种她自己都听不懂的语言和我交谈。","Now I have already said that Madame Eugenie Lalande—that is to say, Simpson—spoke the English language but very little better than she wrote it, and for this reason she very properly never attempted to speak it upon ordinary occasions.But rage will carry a lady to any extreme; and in the present care it carried Mrs. Simpson to the very extraordinary extreme of attempting to hold a conversation in a tongue that she did not altogether understand."
"“啊，先生，”她明显很吃惊，打量了我一番后，她说，“啊，先生？——怎么了？——出什么事了？难道你在跳圣人的舞蹈？如果你不喜欢我，为什么要盲目地和我结婚呢？”","“Vell, Monsieur,” said she, after surveying me, in great apparent astonishment, for some moments—“Vell, Monsieur?—and vat den?—vat de matter now?Is it de dance of de Saint itusse dat you ave?If not like me, vat for vy buy de pig in the poke?”"
"“你真卑鄙！”我喘着气说，“你——你——你这恶毒的老巫婆！”","“You wretch!” said I, catching my breath—“you—you—you villainous old hag!”"
"“啊？——老？——我可不老！我才刚到八十二岁。”","“Ag?—ole?—me not so ver ole, after all!Me not one single day more dan de eighty-doo.”"
"“八十二！”我尖叫道，踉踉跄跄地扶住了墙，“你这八千两百岁的老狒狒！那个袖珍画像上说你才二十七岁零七个月啊！”","“Eighty-two!” I ejaculated, staggering to the wall—“eighty-two hundred thousand baboons!The miniature said twenty-seven years and seven months!”"
"“的确！——确实如此！——非常准确！但是那是五十五年前的肖像。当我和我的第二任丈夫拉朗德先生结婚时，我让人画了那张肖像，送给我和第一任丈夫穆瓦萨尔先生所生的女儿。”","“To be sure!—dat is so!—ver true! but den de portraite has been take for dese fifty-five year.Ven I go marry my segonde usbande, Monsieur Lalande, at dat time I had de portraite take for my daughter by my first usbande, Monsieur Moissart!”"
"“穆瓦萨尔！”我说道。","“Moissart!” said I. "
"“是的，穆瓦萨尔，”她说道，模仿我的发音，但是说实话，说得不太好，“怎么了？你知道穆瓦萨尔什么？”","“Yes, Moissart,” said she, mimicking my pronunciation, which, to speak the truth, was none of the best,—“and vat den?Vat you know about de Moissart?”"
"“没什么，你这老怪物！——我对他一无所知，它只是很久以前我一个祖辈的姓氏。”","“Nothing, you old fright!—I know nothing about him at all; only I had an ancestor of that name, once upon a time.”"
"“那个姓氏！你对那个姓氏有什么要说的吗？这是一个很好的姓氏，瓦萨尔也一样——那也是一个很好的姓氏。我的女儿，穆瓦萨尔小姐，嫁给了瓦萨尔先生——两个姓氏都很体面。”","“Dat name! and vat you ave for say to dat name?’Tis ver goot name; and so is Voissart—dat is ver goot name too.My daughter, Mademoiselle Moissart, she marry von Monsieur Voissart,—and de name is bot ver respectaable name.”"
"“穆瓦萨尔？”我惊叫道，“还有瓦萨尔！为什么，你什么意思？”","“Moissart?” I exclaimed, “and Voissart!Why, what is it you mean?”"
"“我什么意思？——我是说穆瓦萨尔和瓦萨尔，如果要把这件事说清楚，我还要说说克鲁瓦萨尔和弗鲁瓦萨尔。我女儿的女儿，瓦萨尔小姐嫁给了克鲁瓦萨尔先生，然后我女儿的外孙女，克鲁瓦萨尔小姐嫁给了弗鲁瓦萨尔先生。我想你会说那个姓氏并不十分体面——”","“Vat I mean?—I mean Moissart and Voissart; and for de matter of dat, I mean Croissart and Froisart, too, if I only tink proper to mean it.My daughter’s daughter, Mademoiselle Voissart, she marry von Monsieur Croissart, and den again, my daughter’s grande daughter, Mademoiselle Croissart, she marry von Monsieur Froissart; and I suppose you say dat dat is not von ver respectaable name.—”"
"“弗鲁瓦萨尔！”我说道，开始感到有些头晕，“为什么，难道你确定是在说穆瓦萨尔、瓦萨尔、克鲁瓦萨尔和弗鲁瓦萨尔吗？”","“Froissart!” said I, beginning to faint, “why, surely you don’t say Moissart, and Voissart, and Croissart, and Froissart?”"
"“是的，”她回答道，完全靠在了椅子上，把两腿伸得老长，“是的，我说的就是穆瓦萨尔、瓦萨尔、克鲁瓦萨尔和弗鲁瓦萨尔。但是弗鲁瓦萨尔先生正是你们称为傻瓜的那一类人——像你一样是个大傻瓜——因为他离开美丽的法国来到了这个愚蠢的美国，之后生了一个非常非常愚蠢的儿子，这都是我听说的，但是我从未有幸和他见面——我的同伴，斯特凡妮·拉朗德夫人也没见过他。他的名字叫拿破仑·波拿巴·弗鲁瓦萨尔，我想你会说这也不是一个非常体面的名字。”","“Yes,” she replied, leaning fully back in her chair, and stretching out her lower limbs at great length; “yes, Moissart, and Voissart, and Croissart, and Froissart.But Monsieur Froissart, he vas von ver big vat you call fool—he vas von ver great big donce like yourself—for he lef la belle France for come to dis stupide Amerique—and ven he get here he went and ave von ver stupide, von ver, ver stupide sonn, so I hear, dough I not yet av ad de plaisir to meet vid him—neither me nor my companion, de Madame Stephanie Lalande.He is name de Napoleon Bonaparte Froissart, and I suppose you say dat dat, too, is not von ver respectable name.”"
"不管是这段话的长度还是其内容都激起了辛普森夫人极大的激情。费力说完这些，她像是中了魔法似的笨重地从椅子上站了起来，站起来时一整块裙撑全掉在了地上。一站起来，她便用力嚼着口香糖，挥舞着她的手臂，卷起了她的袖子，在我面前挥动着她的拳头，最后把帽子从头上扯下来。她大叫了一声，把和帽子一起扯下来的很漂亮、很值钱的乌黑、浓密的假发用力地摔到了地上，然后踩着跳起了方丹戈舞，完全陷入了绝对的狂喜和愤怒的痛苦中。","Either the length or the nature of this speech, had the effect of working up Mrs. Simpson into a very extraordinary passion indeed; and as she made an end of it, with great labor, she lumped up from her chair like somebody bewitched, dropping upon the floor an entire universe of bustle as she lumped.Once upon her feet, she gnashed her gums, brandished her arms, rolled up her sleeves, shook her fist in my face, and concluded the performance by tearing the cap from her head, and with it an immense wig of the most valuable and beautiful black hair, the whole of which she dashed upon the ground with a yell, and there trammpled and danced a fandango upon it, in an absolute ecstasy and agony of rage."
"同时，我一屁股坐在了她腾空的椅子上。“穆瓦萨尔和瓦萨尔！”我沉思地重复道，这时她跳起了舞步，两脚脚跟相互敲击起来。“还有克鲁瓦萨尔和弗鲁瓦萨尔！”这时她又跳了一步——“穆瓦萨尔、瓦萨尔、克鲁瓦萨尔，还有拿破仑·波拿马·弗鲁瓦萨尔！——为什么，你这不可理喻的老妖怪，那是我——是我——你听到了吗？那是我”——说到这里，我扯着嗓子尖叫道：“那是我——我——我！我就是拿破仑·波拿马·弗鲁瓦萨尔！如果我没有娶我的外高祖母，我想我永远都不会明白！”","Meantime I sank aghast into the chair which she had vacated.“Moissart and Voissart!” I repeated, thoughtfully, as she cut one of her pigeon-wings, and “Croissart and Froissart!” as she completed another—“Moissart and Voissart and Croissart and Napoleon Bonaparte Froissart!—why, you ineffable old serpent, that’s me—that’s me—d’ye hear? that’s me”—here I screamed at the top of my voice—“that’s me-e-e! I am Napoleon Bonaparte Froissart! and if I havn’t married my great, great, grandmother, I wish I may be everlastingly confounded!”"
"欧仁妮·拉朗德夫人，也就是辛普森夫人——以前是穆瓦萨尔夫人——其实是我的外高祖母。她年轻的时候很漂亮，即使到了八十二岁，依然保持着少女时候的挺拔的身材、雕塑般轮廓清晰的头部、炯炯有神的大眼睛，和希腊式的鼻子。借助于这些珍珠粉、胭脂、假发、假牙和撑腰垫，再加上巴黎最高超的女裁缝的手艺，作为法国首都昔日的美人之一，她成功地维系了自己的尊名。在这方面她确实可以和著名的尼农·德兰克劳斯相媲美。","Madame Eugenie Lalande, quasi Simpson—formerly Moissart—was, in sober fact, my great, great, grandmother.In her youth she had been beautiful, and even at eighty-two, retained the majestic height, the sculptural contour of head, the fine eyes and the Grecian nose of her girlhood.By the aid of these, of pearl-powder, of rouge, of false hair, false teeth, and false tournure, as well as of the most skilful modistes of Paris, she contrived to hold a respectable footing among the beauties en peu passees of the French metropolis.In this respect, indeed, she might have been regarded as little less than the equal of the celebrated Ninon De L’Enclos."
"她非常富有，第二任丈夫走后她成了寡妇，没有孩子，于是她想到了在美国的我，为了让我成为她的继承人，她来到了美国，陪她一起来的是她第二任丈夫的一个非常漂亮的远房亲戚——斯特凡妮·拉朗德夫人。","She was immensely wealthy, and being left, for the second time, a widow without children, she bethought herself of my existence in America, and for the purpose of making me her heir, paid a visit to the United States, in company with a distant and exceedingly lovely relative of her second husband’s—a Madame Stephanie Lalande."
"在剧院里，我对外高祖母的注视，引起了她的注意。她通过眼镜仔细打量我一番后，惊讶地发现我很像她的家人。这激起了她的兴趣，而她又知道她要找的继承人正是在这座城市里，于是便向周围的人打听了我的情况。陪伴她的那位绅士认识我，告诉了她我是谁。如此获得的信息诱使她重新仔细审视了我一番。而这番审视鼓励我做出了以上详细叙述过的那些荒唐举动。她还礼鞠了一躬，是因为她以为我碰巧发现了她的身份。而我却被自己的近视和她化妆艺术所蒙蔽，对这位陌生女士的年龄和魅力产生了错觉，于是便热情地向塔尔博特询问她是谁。当然，他断定我是指那位年轻的女士，所以他肯定地告诉我说，她是“著名的寡妇，拉朗德夫人”。","At the opera, my great, great, grandmother’s attention was arrested by my notice; and, upon surveying me through her eye-glass, she was struck with a certain family resemblance to herself.Thus interested, and knowing that the heir she sought was actually in the city, she made inquiries of her party respecting me.The gentleman who attended her knew my person, and told her who I was.The information thus obtained induced her to renew her scrutiny; and this scrutiny it was which so emboldened me that I behaved in the absurd manner already detailed.She returned my bow, however, under the impression that, by some odd accident, I had discovered her identity.When, deceived by my weakness of vision, and the arts of the toilet, in respect to the age and charms of the strange lady, I demanded so enthusiastically of Talbot who she was, he concluded that I meant the younger beauty, as a matter of course, and so informed me, with perfect truth, that she was “the celebrated widow, Madame Lalande.”"
"第二天早上，我的外高祖母在大街上遇到塔尔博特。他是她在巴黎的老相识。他们的谈话很自然地提到了我。然后，塔尔博特向她解释了我的近视，虽然这一缺点已是臭名昭著，但我对此却一无所知。我这位好心的、年迈的亲戚很恼怒，因为她误以为我识破了她的身份，不知道我只是在剧院里向一个素不相识的老妇人公然示爱，让自己丑态百出。为了惩罚我轻率的举动，她和塔尔博特策划了这场阴谋。他故意不见我，就是不想帮我引见。我在大街上打听“美丽的寡妇，拉朗德夫人”，人们都以为我是指那位年轻的女士。当然，我在离开塔尔博特的寓所后不久后与遇见的那三位绅士的谈话就很容易解释了，也难怪他们会提到尼农·德兰克劳斯。我没有机会在白天近观拉朗德夫人。而且，在音乐晚会上，我愚蠢地拒绝戴眼镜，也没能看出她的年龄。请“拉朗德夫人”去唱歌的人叫的其实是那位年轻的女士。应声站起来的也正是那位女士。为了进一步欺骗我，我的外高祖母也同时站了起来，陪她走到了主客厅的钢琴旁边。如果当时我决定陪她过去，她就会建议我说坐着不动才为得体。但是当时我很谨慎，她就没有这么说的必要了。她的歌声让我爱慕，让我确信我的爱人很年轻，而这歌曲实际上是斯特凡妮·拉朗德夫人唱的。送我眼镜是为了让骗局更真实——使骗局更有讽刺性。送我眼镜也为她提供了机会来就做作大发感慨，好专门对我进行训导。老妇人戴的那副眼镜已经换成了一副更适合我这个年龄戴的，说这些几乎是多余的。这副眼镜确实非常适合我。","In the street, next morning, my great, great, grandmother encountered Talbot, an old Parisian acquaintance; and the conversation, very naturally turned upon myself.My deficiencies of vision were then explained; for these were notorious, although I was entirely ignorant of their notoriety, and my good old relative discovered, much to her chagrin, that she had been deceived in supposing me aware of her identity, and that I had been merely making a fool of myself in making open love, in a theatre, to an old woman unknown.By way of punishing me for this imprudence, she concocted with Talbot a plot.He purposely kept out of my way to avoid giving me the introduction.My street inquiries about “the lovely widow, Madame Lalande,” were supposed to refer to the younger lady, of course, and thus the conversation with the three gentlemen whom I encountered shortly after leaving Talbot’s hotel will be easily explained, as also their allusion to Ninon De L’Enclos.I had no opportunity of seeing Madame Lalande closely during daylight; and, at her musical soiree, my silly weakness in refusing the aid of glasses effectually prevented me from making a discovery of her age.When “Madame Lalande” was called upon to sing, the younger lady was intended; and it was she who arose to obey the call; my great, great, grandmother, to further the deception, arising at the same moment and accompanying her to the piano in the main drawing-room.Had I decided upon escorting her thither, it had been her design to suggest the propriety of my remaining where I was; but my own prudential views rendered this unnecessary.The songs which I so much admired, and which so confirmed my impression of the youth of my mistress, were executed by Madame Stephanie Lalande.The eyeglass was presented by way of adding a reproof to the hoax—a sting to the epigram of the deception.Its presentation afforded an opportunity for the lecture upon affectation with which I was so especially edified.It is almost superfluous to add that the glasses of the instrument, as worn by the old lady, had been exchanged by her for a pair better adapted to my years.They suited me, in fact, to a T."
"那个假装为我们举行婚礼的牧师，实际上是塔尔博特的一个好朋友，而不是牧师。不过，他是个很优秀的车夫。他脱下教士袍，穿上厚大衣，赶着这辆载着一对“幸福夫妇”的马车出了城。塔尔博特就坐在他旁边。这两个坏蛋就这样看到了事情的结果。他们通过旅馆的后客厅那半开的窗户，一边看着这场闹剧的结果，一边幸灾乐祸地笑着。我想我会被逼得叫他们出来决斗。","The clergyman, who merely pretended to tie the fatal knot, was a boon companion of Talbot’s , and no priest.He was an excellent “whip,” however; and having doffed his cassock to put on a great-coat, he drove the hack which conveyed the “happy couple” out of town.Talbot took a seat at his side.The two scoundrels were thus “in at the death”, and through a half-open window of the back parlor of the inn, amused themselves in grinning at the denouement of the drama.I believe I shall be forced to call them both out."
"不过，我没有成为我的外高祖母的丈夫，这种想法让我轻松了很多——但是我是拉朗德夫人的丈夫——斯特凡妮·拉朗德夫人的丈夫——我好心的、年迈的亲戚除了把我定为她死后唯一的继承人外——如果真有那么一天的话——她还费劲心机地为我做了媒。总之：我从此不再写情书了，而且也决不会不戴眼镜就去见人了。","Nevertheless, I am not the husband of my great, great, grandmother; and this is a reflection which affords me infinite relief,—but I am the husband of Madame Lalande—of Madame Stephanie Lalande—with whom my good old relative, besides making me her sole heir when she dies—if she ever does—has been at the trouble of concocting me a match.In conclusion: I am done forever with billets doux and am never to be met without SPECTACLES."
