"一块牛排","A Piece of Steak"
"作者：杰克·伦敦","by Jack London"
"汤姆·金捏住最后一小片面包，抹净盘子上最后一点儿面糊肉汁，然后把它塞进嘴里，慢慢地、若有所思地嚼着这一小块。他吃完从桌旁起身时，那种明显的饥饿感还是让他很郁闷。可只有他一个人吃了。隔壁房间的两个孩子已早早地被送上床，因为睡梦中他们就不会记得没吃晚饭了。他老婆也什么都没吃，一直静静地坐着，忧心忡忡地看着他。她是一个瘦弱憔悴的女工，可她那张脸上仍不乏一些昔日光鲜美丽的痕迹。做肉汁的小麦粉是她从走廊对面的邻居家借来的。面包是她用最后两个便士买的。","With the last morsel of bread Tom King wiped his plate clean of the last particle of flour gravy and chewed the resulting mouthful in a slow and meditative way.When he arose from the table, he was oppressed by the feeling that he was distinctly hungry.Yet he alone had eaten.The two children in the other room had been sent early to bed in order that in sleep they might forget they had gone supperless.His wife had touched nothing, and had sat silently and watched him with solicitous eyes.She was a thin, worn woman of the working-class, though signs of an earlier prettiness were not wanting in her face.The flour for the gravy she had borrowed from the neighbor across the hall.The last two ha’pennies had gone to buy the bread."
"他坐在窗边一把椅子上，那椅子经不住他的体重，被压得摇摇晃晃，像要散架了似的。他下意识地把烟斗塞进嘴里，将手伸进外套口袋。他没摸到烟草，这才意识到自己的动作；他不由皱起眉头，一边怪自己健忘，一边把烟斗收好。他的动作很迟缓，简直可以说是笨拙，好像他不胜肌肉的重荷似的。他是一个身材健壮、表情木讷的男人，外表也不太讨人喜欢。他的衣服粗糙、破旧又邋遢。他那双鞋的鞋面破得快拖不动厚重的鞋底了，鞋底本身也很久未曾换过了。他的棉衬衣是一件只值两先令的便宜货，衣领已经磨破，上面的漆渍洗也洗不干净。","He sat down by the window on a rickety chair that protested under his weight, and quite mechanically he put his pipe in his mouth and dipped into the side pocket of his coat.The absence of any tobacco made him aware of his action, and, with a scowl for his forgetfulness, he put the pipe away.His movements were slow, almost hulking, as though he were burdened by the heavy weight of his muscles.He was a solid-bodied, stolid-looking man, and his appearance did not suffer from being overprepossessing.His rough clothes were old and slouchy.The uppers of his shoes were too weak to carry the heavy resoling that was itself of no recent date.And his cotton shirt, a cheap, two-shilling affair, showed a frayed collar and ineradicable paint stains."
"不过，只消看一看汤姆·金的那张脸，你就准能猜出他是干什么的。那是一张典型的职业拳击手的脸，只有长年打拼在拳击台上的人才会拥有这样的脸，因此那上面会鲜明地显露出好斗猛兽的一切特征。这显然是张闷闷不乐的脸，而且由于胡子刮得干干净净，什么特征都一目了然。他的两片嘴唇已经变形，合成一张难看的嘴巴，好像脸上一条又长又深的伤疤。他的下巴粗壮，显得好斗而残忍。紧锁的浓眉下面，一双眼睛转动得很慢，眼皮耷拉着，让人几乎看不出任何情绪。他完全像只野兽，而最像野兽的部分就是他的眼睛。那双眼睛看似惺忪，却像狮子一般——一种好斗野兽的眼睛。他前额发际线不高，因为头发剃得很短；一颗丑陋的脑袋上每一处隆起的部分都轮廓鲜明。他那只鼻子被打断过两次，还挨过数不清的拳头，变得怪模怪样；一只耳朵如卷心菜一样蜷曲着，肿得比原来大了一圈，这些都装点着他的面容；而他的胡子虽然刚刚被刮过了，但胡茬又从皮肤里生了出来，让脸呈现出一种蓝黑的颜色。","But it was Tom King’s face that advertised him unmistakably for what he was.It was the face of a typical prize-fighter; of one who had put in long years of service in the squared ring and, by that means, developed and emphasized all the marks of the fighting beast.It was distinctly a lowering countenance, and, that no feature of it might escape notice, it was clean-shaven.The lips were shapeless, and constituted a mouth harsh to excess, that was like a gash in his face.The jaw was aggressive, brutal, heavy.The eyes, slow of movement and heavy-lidded, were almost expressionless under the shaggy, indrawn brows.Sheer animal that he was, the eyes were the most animal-like feature about him.They were sleepy, lion-like—the eyes of a fighting animal.The forehead slanted quickly back to the hair, which, clipped close, showed every bump of a villainous-looking head.A nose, twice broken and moulded variously by countless blows, and a cauliflower ear, permanently swollen and distorted to twice its size, completed his adornment, while the beard, fresh-shaven as it was, sprouted in the skin and gave the face a blue-black stain."
"总之，要是谁在漆黑的小巷或者偏僻的地方看到这张脸，肯定会被吓着。不过，汤姆·金可不是罪犯，也没有做过任何犯法的事。干他这行的都要打斗，但在拳击场之外，他没伤害过任何人。也从没听说他和谁吵过架。他是个职业拳击手，他那股打架的狠劲儿都留着用到了职业比赛上。在拳击场之外，他是个腿脚迟缓、个性温和的人。他年轻时手头非常宽裕，他也出手阔绰，从来不为自己着想。他没有怨恨，也很少树敌。打拳对他来说只是个谋生的活计。在拳击台上，他出拳把人打伤、打残，甚至打死，可并没有什么恶意。那只不过是这个行业里的家常便饭罢了。观众花钱进拳击场，就是来看人们互相把对方打倒在地的。获胜一方可以将这一大笔钱收入囊中。20年前，汤姆·金对垒伍鲁木鲁·高杰的时候，他知道高杰的下巴在纽卡斯尔的那场比赛中受了伤，才好了不到四个月。所以他就专门瞄着那个下巴打，终于在第九轮又把它给打坏了。他这么做倒不是因为对高杰怀有什么敌意，而是因为要想把高杰打倒，赢得那一大笔钱，这法子最保险。高杰也不会因此记仇。比赛就是这么回事，他们两个都明白规则，并且依此行事。","All together, it was the face of a man to be afraid of in a dark alley or lonely place.And yet Tom King was not a criminal, nor had he ever done anything criminal.Outside of brawls, common to his walk in life, he had harmed no one.Nor had he ever been known to pick a quarrel.He was a professional, and all the fighting brutishness of him was reserved for his professional appearances.Outside the ring he was slow-going, easy-natured, and, in his younger days, when money was flush, too open-handed for his own good.He bore no grudges and had few enemies.Fighting was a business with him.In the ring he struck to hurt, struck to maim, struck to destroy; but there was no animus in it.It was a plain business proposition.Audiences assembled and paid for the spectacle of men knocking each other out.The winner took the big end of the purse.When Tom King faced the Woolloomoolloo Gouger, twenty years before, he knew that the Gouger’s jaw was only four months healed after having been broken in a Newcastle bout.And he had played for that jaw and broken it again in the ninth round, not because he bore the Gouger any ill-will, but because that was the surest way to put the Gouger out and win the big end of the purse.Nor had the Gouger borne him any ill-will for it.It was the game, and both knew the game and played it."
"汤姆·金向来不爱讲话，他只是坐在窗边，愁眉苦脸，一言不发地盯着自己的一双手。手背的血管鼓了起来，又粗又肿，指关节饱受击打，已经粉碎变形，一看就知道吃过什么苦头。没人告诉过他，一个人能活多久全看血管能撑多久，可他完全明白这些粗大的、鼓出来的血管意味着什么。他的心脏曾经铆足劲儿往这些血管里输送了太多的血液。如今这些血管已经不中用了。它们已经被撑得失去了弹性，而且随着它们变得越来越肿，他的耐力也越来越差。他现在很容易就会觉得累。原来他可以迅速打完20个回合，一回合接着一回合拼命地打呀，打呀打呀，愈战愈猛，一会儿被对手打倒在围绳上，一会儿又反过来将对手打倒在围绳上。越到最后，拳头越是狠越是快，终于在第20个回合，全场观众都站起来大叫的时候，他会加快速度跑动、出拳、闪躲，把暴雨般的拳头一阵阵挥出去，同时也挨着对手一阵阵的拳头。整场比赛，他的心脏都老老实实地把汹涌的血液送进那些完好的血管。可现在，他再也不行了。那些血管当时鼓得很大，但总会缩回原状，不过也不是完全一样——每次它们都会比以前大上那么一点儿，只是起初几乎看不出来而已。他盯着这些血管和被打伤的指关节，一瞬间仿佛又看到了这双手曾经健康漂亮的样子，不过那都是他在本尼·琼斯（又称“威尔士凶神”）的脑袋上打坏自己的第一个指关节之前的事情了。","Tom King had never been a talker, and he sat by the window, morosely silent, staring at his hands.The veins stood out on the backs of the hands, large and swollen; and the knuckles, smashed and battered and malformed, testified to the use to which they had been put.He had never heard that a man’s life was the life of his arteries, but well he knew the meaning of those big, upstanding veins.His heart had pumped too much blood through them at top pressure.They no longer did the work.He had stretched the elasticity out of them, and with their distention had passed his endurance.He tired easily now.No longer could he do a fast twenty rounds, hammer and tongs, fight, fight, fight, from gong to gong, with fierce rally on top of fierce rally, beaten to the ropes and in turn beating his opponent to the ropes, and rallying fiercest and fastest of all in that last, twentieth round, with the house on its feet and yelling, himself rushing, striking, ducking, raining showers of blows upon showers of blows and receiving showers of blows in return, and all the time the heart faithfully pumping the surging blood through the adequate veins.The veins, swollen at the time, had always shrunk down again, though not quite—each time, imperceptibly at first, remaining just a trifle larger than before.He stared at them and at his battered knuckles, and, for the moment, caught a vision of the youthful excellence of those hands before the first knuckle had been smashed on the head of Benny Jones, otherwise known as the Welsh Terror."
"饥饿感再次向他袭来。","The impression of his hunger came back on him."
"“哎呀，我连块牛排都没的吃吗！”他大声嘟囔着，捏紧自己大大的拳头，闷声骂了一句。","“Blimey, but couldn’t I go a piece of steak!” he muttered aloud, clenching his huge fists and spitting out a smothered oath."
"“伯克和索里两家店我都去过了。”她妻子有些抱歉地说。","“I tried both Burke’s an’ Sawley’s,” his wife said half apologetically."
"“他们不肯？”他问道。","“An’ they wouldn’t?” he demanded."
"“一个子儿也不肯赊。勃克说——”她支支吾吾地没敢说下去。“说！他说什么？”","“Not a ha’penny. Burke said—” She faltered.“G’wan!Wot’d he say?”"
"“他说他觉得今天晚上桑德尔一定会打败你，还有他给你赊的账已经够多了。”","“As how ’e was thinkin’ Sandel ud do ye to-night, an’ as how yer score was comfortable big as it was.”"
"汤姆·金哼了一声，但是没有回话。他正满心想着年轻时他给自己养的那条猎犬喂过多少牛排，数也数不清。那时候，要伯克给他赊一千块牛排也没问题。可惜时过境迁。汤姆·金年纪越来越大，一个在二流俱乐部打拳的老家伙，可不能指望商人们会赊给他多少账。","Tom King grunted, but did not reply.He was busy thinking of the bull terrier he had kept in his younger days to which he had fed steaks without end.Burke would have given him credit for a thousand steaks—then.But times had changed.Tom King was getting old; and old men, fighting before second-rate clubs, couldn’t expect to run bills of any size with the tradesmen."
"今天一早他起床的时候就想吃块牛排，现在这愿望还是一样强烈。他没有为这次比赛好好训练。这一年澳大利亚大旱，日子不好过，想找个打零工的活儿都难。他没有练拳的伙伴，吃不上什么好东西，而且还总吃不饱。有机会他会干上几天苦力。每天一大早，他都会绕着多曼公园跑上几圈，练练腿脚。不过这可难为他了，训练找不到伙伴，还要养活一个婆娘、两个孩子。他被选中和桑德尔比赛的时候，商人们才肯给他稍微多赊一点儿账。快活俱乐部的秘书已经提前付了他三英镑——就是输家的那份钱——除此之外，就不再借给他了。有时候他能想法子从老朋友那儿借到几个先令，他们本来可以多借点儿的，可惜今年大旱，他们自己过得都很艰难。没用的——再怎么掩饰，事实也不会改变——他的训练不达标。他应该吃得好一点儿，心里不该有牵挂。再说，一个人到了40岁，要进入状态可比他20岁的时候难多了。","He had got up in the morning with a longing for a piece of steak, and the longing had not abated.He had not had a fair training for this fight.It was a drought year in Australia, times were hard, and even the most irregular work was difficult to find.He had had no sparring partner, and his food had not been of the best nor always sufficient.He had done a few days’ navvy work when he could get it, and he had run around the Domain in the early mornings to get his legs in shape.But it was hard, training without a partner and with a wife and two kiddies that must be fed.Credit with the tradesmen had undergone very slight expansion when he was matched with Sandel.The secretary of the Gayety Club had advanced him three pounds—the loser’s end of the purse—and beyond that had refused to go.Now and again he had managed to borrow a few shillings from old pals, who would have lent more only that it was a drought year and they were hard put themselves.No—and there was no use in disguising the fact—his training had not been satisfactory.He should have had better food and no worries.Besides, when a man is forty, it is harder to get into condition than when he is twenty."
"“现在几点了，利齐？”他问道。","“What time is it, Lizzie?” he asked."
"他妻子穿过厅堂去看了看时间，回来说道：","His wife went across the hall to inquire, and came back."
"“差一刻八点。”","“Quarter before eight.”"
"“再过几分钟他们就要开始第一轮比赛了，”他说，“只是一场热身赛。然后是迪勒·韦尔斯和格里德利四个回合的比赛，之后是斯塔赖特和一个水手的十个回合。还得过一个多小时才轮到我上场呢。”","“They’ll be startin’ the first bout in a few minutes,” he said.“Only a try-out.Then there’s a four-round spar ’tween Dealer Wells an’ Gridley, an’ a ten-round go ’tween Starlight an’ some sailor bloke. don’t come on for over an hour.”"
"他又静静坐了10分钟，然后站起身来。","At the end of another silent ten minutes, he rose to his feet."
"“老实说，利齐，我还没有好好训练过。”","“Truth is, Lizzie, I ain’t had proper trainin’.”"
"他伸手拿起帽子，向门口走去。他并没有主动去吻她——他出门的时候从不这么做——但这天晚上她却壮着胆去吻了他，两手抱住他，让他不得不弯下腰来和她亲吻。在这男人庞大的身躯旁，她看起来显得十分娇小。","He reached for his hat and started for the door.He did not offer to kiss her—he never did on going out—but on this night she dared to kiss him, throwing her arms around him and compelling him to bend down to her face.She looked quite small against the massive bulk of the man."
"“祝你好运，汤姆，”她说，“你一定得打赢他。”","“Good luck, Tom,” she said.“You gotter do ’im.”"
"“是啊，我一定得打赢他，”他重复着她的话，“只能这么着了。我一定得打赢他。”","“Ay, I gotter do ’im,” he repeated.“That’s all there is to it.I jus’ gotter do ’im.”"
"他大笑起来，故作轻松，而她却将他抱得更紧了。越过她的肩头，他看了看这个空荡荡的房间。这就是他在世上拥有的一切，一间欠着房租的屋子、老婆和孩子们。现在他要离开这儿，趁着夜色去给他的配偶和幼崽觅食——不是像一个现代社会的工人那样去操作机床，而是像野兽一样用古老、原始、隆重而又野蛮的方式去猎食。“我一定得打赢他，”他又说了一遍，这一次，声音里透着一股豁出去的意味。“要是赢了，就有30磅到手——还清欠债，还能剩下不少。要是输了，我就一个子儿也得不到——连坐电车回家的钱都没有。秘书已经把输家的那份钱给我了。我走了，老婆子。要是赢了我会马上回来。“","He laughed with an attempt at heartiness, while she pressed more closely against him.Across her shoulders he looked around the bare room.It was all he had in the world, with the rent overdue, and her and the kiddies.And he was leaving it to go out into the night to get meat for his mate and cubs—not like a modern working-man going to his machine grind, but in the old, primitive, royal, animal way, by fighting for it.“I gotter do ’im,” he repeated, this time a hint of desperation in his voice.“If it’s a win, it’s thirty quid—an’ I can pay all that’s owin’, with a lump o’ money left over.If it’s a lose, I get naught—not even a penny for me to ride home on the tram.The secretary’s give all that’s comin’ from a loser’s end.Good-by, old woman.I’ll come straight home if it’s a win.”"
"“我等着你。”她站在厅堂里对他喊道。","“An’ I’ll be waitin’ up,” she called to him along the hall."
"快活俱乐部离这儿足有两英里，他走在路上，回忆起了自己辉煌的日子——他曾经是新南威尔士的重量级冠军——他会坐着马车去拳击场，还常常会有个给他下大注的人替他付车钱，和他一路同行。汤米·伯恩斯，还有那个美国黑鬼杰克·约翰逊——他们都是坐汽车出行。可他只能步行！谁都知道，比赛开始前，辛苦走上两英里不是什么好的开始。他老了，这个世道对老家伙可不怎么样。除了卖苦力，他什么也不会干，而且就算如此，他骨折了的鼻子和肿起的耳朵也总是让他不好过。他真希望自己当初能学门手艺。长远来讲，境况总会好点儿。可是没人跟他说过这个，而且他心里也清楚，就算有人告诉他，那时的自己也听不进去。一切来得太过容易。大把的票子——刺激、精彩的拳击比赛——中间大把休息闲荡的时间——一群拼命拍他马屁的追随者争相拍他的肩，握他的手，那些纨绔子弟巴不得能替他买酒，好有幸能和他说上五分钟的话——这是多么荣耀的场面，观众大声狂呼，他旋风似的收场，裁判宣布“金赢了！”，第二天他的名字就登上了体育专栏。","It was full two miles to the Gayety, and as he walked along he remembered how in his palmy days—he had once been the heavyweight champion of New South Wales—he would have ridden in a cab to the fight, and how, most likely, some heavy backer would have paid for the cab and ridden with him.There were Tommy Burns and that Yankee nigger, Jack Johnson—they rode about in motor-cars.And he walked!And, as any man knew, a hard two miles was not the best preliminary to a fight.He was an old un, and the world did not wag well with old uns.He was good for nothing now except navvy work, and his broken nose and swollen ear were against him even in that.He found himself wishing that he had learned a trade.It would have been better in the long run.But no one had told him, and he knew, deep down in his heart, that he would not have listened if they had.It had been so easy.Big money—sharp, glorious fights—periods of rest and loafing in between—a following of eager flatterers, the slaps on the back, the shakes of the hand, the toffs glad to buy him a drink for the privilege of five minutes’ talk—and the glory of it, the yelling houses, the whirlwind finish, the referee’s “King wins!” and his name in the sporting columns next day."
"那才是他的黄金时代！可仔细回想，他现在慢慢意识到，他当时打倒的正是一些老家伙。他那时年纪尚轻，正在崛起；而那些人已经老去，正在衰退中。怪不得一切得来如此容易——因为他们打过太多比赛，他们的血管已经肿胀，指节已经打伤，筋骨都已经疲乏。他想起在拉什卡特斯海湾，他在第18个回合打倒了老斯托舍·比尔那次，比赛后老比尔在更衣间哭得像个小孩子的情形。也许老比尔当时也欠着房租。也许他家里也有一个老婆和两个孩子要养。也许比尔在比赛的那天也特别想吃一块牛排。比尔比赛的时候很拼命，也被他打得很惨。如今，在自己也受到了这种折磨后他才明白，20年前的那天晚上，斯托舍·比尔是在为了一份更大的赌注而战，而年轻的汤姆·金不过是奔着荣誉和赚钱容易来的。怪不得斯托舍·比尔比赛后会在更衣室里痛哭。","Those had been times!But he realized now, in his slow, ruminating way, that it was the old uns he had been putting away.He was Youth, rising; and they were Age, sinking.No wonder it had been easy—they with their swollen veins and battered knuckles and weary in the bones of them from the long battles they had already fought.He remembered the time he put out old Stowsher Bill, at Rush-Cutters Bay, in the eighteenth round, and how old Bill had cried afterward in the dressing-room like a baby.Perhaps old Bill’s rent had been overdue.Perhaps he’d had at home a missus an’ a couple of kiddies.And perhaps Bill, that very day of the fight, had had a hungering for a piece of steak.Bill had fought game and taken incredible punishment.He could see now, after he had gone through the mill himself, that Stowsher Bill had fought for a bigger stake, that night twenty years ago, than had young Tom King, who had fought for glory and easy money.No wonder Stowsher Bill had cried afterward in the dressing-room."
"说起来，一个人一辈子能打下来的比赛本来也只有那么多场。这是拳击比赛无可更改的铁律。有的人也许能狠狠打上100场，有些人只能打上20场。每个人根据自己的体格和耐力都有个确切的数字，打完了自己的定数，他也就完了。不错，他比大多数同行打的场次都多，经历的苦战也超出了自己的极限——这些比赛让他的心脏和肺部都快爆裂了，让他的动脉血管失去弹性，让年轻、光滑而有弹性的肌肉变得僵硬打结；它们消磨掉了他的勇气与活力，让他的头脑和筋骨在过度的用力与忍耐中疲惫不堪。不错，他比其他人干得都好。他原先的老搭档一个也没留下。在那些老拳击手里，只有他撑到了最后。他看着他们一个个完蛋，甚至亲手将其中几个人送上了末路。","Well, a man had only so many fights in him, to begin with.It was the iron law of the game.One man might have a hundred hard fights in him, another man only twenty; each, according to the make of him and the quality of his fibre, had a definite number, and, when he had fought them, he was done.Yes, he had had more fights in him than most of them, and he had had far more than his share of the hard, gruelling fights—the kind that worked the heart and lungs to bursting, that took the elastic out of the arteries and made hard knots of muscle out of Youth’s sleek suppleness, that wore out nerve and stamina and made brain and bones weary from excess of effort and endurance overwrought.Yes, he had done better than all of them.There was none of his old fighting partners left.He was the last of the old guard.He had seen them all finished, and he had had a hand in finishing some of them."
"他们曾经拿老家伙来试探他的实力，结过他把这些老家伙一个一个都打倒了——当他们像老斯托舍·比尔一样在更衣室哭泣的时候，他笑得正欢。如今他老了，他们又拿他来试那些年轻人的身手。就拿桑德尔那家伙来说吧。他来自新西兰，战功赫赫。可在澳大利亚，还没人清楚他的能耐，所以他们让他和老汤姆·金打。要是桑德尔打得漂亮，他们会让他跟更好的拳击手打，赢更多的钱。所以，毫无疑问，他一定会发起一场恶战。凭着这场比赛他可以赢得一切——金钱、荣耀和大好前程。汤姆·金不过是个头发灰白的老绊脚石，挡在他名利双收的康庄大道上。而他自己呢，除了30磅什么也赢不到，还要去还清房东和店商的欠账。汤姆·金就这样沉浸在思绪中，迟钝的脑海中显出了青春的形象——在那光辉灿烂的青春时代，他眉飞色舞、不可一世，他有着柔韧的肌肉和光洁的皮肤，不知疲倦，未经伤痛的心肺还嘲笑着力量的极限。不错，青春就像复仇女神。它摧毁老家伙，却不知这样做的同时也摧毁了自己。它让自己的血脉扩张，挥拳猛击，随后又被后来者的青春毁掉。因为青春是不老的。老的只是人的年华。","They had tried him out against the old uns, and one after another he had put them away—laughing when, like old Stowsher Bill, they cried in the dressing-room.And now he was an old un, and they tried out the youngsters on him.There was that bloke, Sandel.He had come over from New Zealand with a record behind him.But nobody in Australia knew anything about him, so they put him up against old Tom King.If Sandel made a showing, he would be given better men to fight, with bigger purses to win; so it was to be depended upon that he would put up a fierce battle.He had everything to win by it—money and glory and career; and Tom King was the grizzled old chopping-block that guarded the highway to fame and fortune.And he had nothing to win except thirty quid, to pay to the landlord and the tradesmen.And, as Tom King thus ruminated, there came to his stolid vision the form of Youth, glorious Youth, rising exultant and invincible, supple of muscle and silken of skin, with heart and lungs that had never been tired and torn and that laughed at limitation of effort.Yes, Youth was the Nemesis.It destroyed the old uns and recked not that, in so doing, it destroyed itself.It enlarged its arteries and smashed its knuckles, and was in turn destroyed by Youth.For Youth was ever youthful.It was only Age that grew old."
"到卡斯尔雷街的时候他向左转弯，然后又走过三个街区才到了快活俱乐部。一群在门外逗留的小混混恭敬地给他让路，他听见其中一个对另一个说：“那就是他！那就是汤姆·金！”","At Castlereagh Street he turned to the left, and three blocks along came to the Gayety.A crowd of young larrikins hanging outside the door made respectful way for him, and he heard one say to another: “That’s ’im! That’s Tom King!”"
"进去后，在去更衣室的路上，他碰到了俱乐部的秘书，一个眼光锐利、满脸精明的年轻人，他们握了握手。","Inside, on the way to his dressing-room, he encountered the secretary, a keen-eyed, shrewd-faced young man, who shook his hand."
"“感觉怎么样，汤姆？”他问。","“How are you feelin’, Tom?” he asked."
"“好得很，”金回答道，虽然他知道这是谎话，要是他有一英镑，他会马上用来换一块上好的牛排。","“Fit as a fiddle,” King answered, though he knew that he lied, and that if he had a quid, he would give it right there for a good piece of steak."
"他从更衣室出来，身后跟着助手。这时，沿着过道走进大厅中央的拳击台时，等待着的人群中立刻爆发出一阵欢呼和掌声。他向左右的人群致意，但没几张脸是他认识的。他在拳击台上赢得第一顶桂冠时，这些人中的大多数都还没出生呢。他轻快地跳到台上，低头钻过围绳，来到场上属于他的场角，然后坐在一张折叠凳子上。裁判杰克·鲍尔过来与他握手。鲍尔是个废掉的职业拳击手，已经十多年没在拳击台上打拳了。金见他来当裁判很高兴。他们都是老家伙了。要是他对桑德尔稍稍犯规，他知道鲍尔准会给他通融一下的。","When he emerged from the dressing-room, his seconds behind him, and came down the aisle to the squared ring in the centre of the hall, a burst of greeting and applause went up from the waiting crowd.He acknowledged salutations right and left, though few of the faces did he know.Most of them were the faces of kiddies unborn when he was winning his first laurels in the squared ring.He leaped lightly to the raised platform and ducked through the ropes to his corner, where he sat down on a folding stool.Jack Ball, the referee, came over and shook his hand.Ball was a broken-down pugilist who for over ten years had not entered the ring as a principal.King was glad that he had him for referee.They were both old uns.If he should rough it with Sandel a bit beyond the rules, he knew Ball could be depended upon to pass it by."
"雄心勃勃的年轻重量级拳手，一个接着一个钻进了拳击护栏，由裁判一一介绍给观众。同时，他也会宣布他们提出的挑战。","Aspiring young heavyweights, one after another, were climbing into the ring and being presented to the audience by the referee.Also, he issued their challenges for them."
"“年轻的普隆托，”鲍尔大声宣布，“来自悉尼北部，愿意另加50磅赌注挑战胜利者。”","“Young Pronto,” Ball announced, “from North Sydney, challenges the winner for fifty pounds side bet.”"
"观众一阵喝彩，等桑德尔钻进围绳，坐到自己的场角时，喝彩声再次响起。汤姆·金好奇地看着对面的桑德尔，因为再过几分钟，他们就要在这场残酷的比赛中扭作一团，两人都会使出全身力气把对方打昏。但他看不到什么，因为桑德尔像他一样，在拳击服外面还套了裤子和套衫。他的相貌十分英俊，顶着一头黄色卷发，从那结实的、肌肉发达的脖子来看，他的身材一定十分强健。","The audience applauded, and applauded again as Sandel himself sprang through the ropes and sat down in his corner.Tom King looked across the ring at him curiously, for in a few minutes they would be locked together in merciless combat, each trying with all the force of him to knock the other into unconsciousness.But little could he see, for Sandel, like himself, had trousers and sweater on over his ring costume.His face was strongly handsome, crowned with a curly mop of yellow hair, while his thick, muscular neck hinted at bodily magnificence."
"扬·普隆托从一个场角走到另一个场角，和台上的拳击手们一一握完手就又下去了。挑战继续进行。总有年轻人钻过围绳——没有名气却野心勃勃——向所有人叫嚣着，要凭借自己的力量和技巧，和胜利者一决高下。几年前，在他战无不胜的全盛时期，这番情景只会让汤姆·金觉得好笑和无聊。但现在，他全神贯注地坐着，没办法甩开眼前那些青春的幻影。拳击赛中总是这些年轻人站出来，跳进围绳，大声宣战，而在他们面前倒下的总是老一辈的人。他们踩在老一辈的身上，爬向成功的巅峰。但总是有人过来，一拨又一拨的年轻人——青春难以抑制，势不可挡——他们总是将前辈打倒，直到自己也老去，走上同样的下坡路，在他们身后推搡着他们的也永远是年轻人——新生的婴孩，变得健壮，把他们的老前辈们打倒，更多的孩子随之而来，无穷无尽——青年一定有着自己的信念，而信念永远不会消亡。","Young Pronto went to one corner and then the other, shaking hands with the principals and dropping down out of the ring.The challenges went on.Ever Youth climbed through the ropes—Youth unknown, but insatiable—crying out to mankind that with strength and skill it would match issues with the winner.A few years before, in his own heyday of invincibleness, Tom King would have been amused and bored by these preliminaries.But now he sat fascinated, unable to shake the vision of Youth from his eyes.Always were these youngsters rising up in the boxing game, springing through the ropes and shouting their defiance; and always were the old uns going down before them.They climbed to success over the bodies of the old uns.And ever they came, more and more youngsters—Youth unquenchable and irresistible—and ever they put the old uns away, themselves becoming old uns and travelling the same downward path, while behind them, ever pressing on them, was Youth eternal—the new babies, grown lusty and dragging their elders down, with behind them more babies to the end of time—Youth that must have its will and that will never die."
"金向记者席看过去，向运动员莫根和裁判科比特点了点头。然后，他伸出手，让桑德尔的一个助手先仔细检查他指节上的绷带，再监视着他的助手锡德·沙利文和查利·贝茨给他套上手套并将其系紧。他自己的一个助手也在桑德尔的场角进行着同样的工作。桑德尔的外裤已经被脱了下来，而且在他站起来的时候，他的套衫也让人从头上摘了下来。汤姆·金望过去，看见的是青春的化身，厚实的胸脯、强壮的筋骨，在他白皙光滑的皮肤下肌肉滑动如同活物。整个身体都充满了活力，汤姆·金知道那是一个从来没有失去过朝气的生命，但在经历了长年的比赛之后，这些朝气会从那酸痛的毛孔中溜走，青春会为此付出代价，等它离开时就远不如登场时那么年轻了。","King glanced over to the press box and nodded to Morgan, of the Sportsman, and Corbett, of the Referee.Then he held out his hands, while Sid Sullivan and Charley Bates, his seconds, slipped on his gloves and laced them tight, closely watched by one of Sandel’s seconds, who first examined critically the tapes on King’s knuckles.A second of his own was in Sandel’s corner, performing a like office.Sandel’s trousers were pulled off, and, as he stood up, his sweater was skinned off over his head.And Tom King, looking, saw Youth incarnate, deep-chested, heavy-thewed, with muscles that slipped and slid like live things under the white satin skin.The whole body was acrawl with life, and Tom King knew that it was a life that had never oozed its freshness out through the aching pores during the long fights wherein Youth paid its toll and departed not quite so young as when it entered."
"这两个人向对方走去，随着一声锣响，助手们也噼噼啪啪折起板凳陆续下场，他们握了握手，马上拿出了比赛的姿态。桑德尔立刻像一个由钢筋和弹簧制成的机械装置，一触即发，一会儿进攻，一会儿退守，又再次进攻，一记左拳击中了汤姆的眼睛，又一记右拳打中了他的肋骨，然后低头闪过汤姆的回击，他轻巧地跳开，再气势汹汹地逼近。他的动作敏捷而狡黠。这是一场让人眼花缭乱的表演。全场观众大声喝彩。不过，金可没有被唬住。他打过太多场比赛，迎战过太多年轻人了。他清楚这些拳头真正的分量——拳出得太快太灵巧反而没什么危险。显然，桑德尔一开始就想速战速决。这是意料之中的。年轻人总是这样，在胡乱冒进和猛烈攻击中，肆意消耗着自身的光辉和优势，想凭着无限辉煌的力量和好胜心来压垮对手。","The two men advanced to meet each other, and, as the gong sounded and the seconds clattered out of the ring with the folding stools, they shook hands and instantly took their fighting attitudes.And instantly, like a mechanism of steel and springs balanced on a hair trigger, Sandel was in and out and in again, landing a left to the eyes, a right to the ribs, ducking a counter, dancing lightly away and dancing menacingly back again.He was swift and clever.It was a dazzling exhibition.The house yelled its approbation.But King was not dazzled.He had fought too many fights and too many youngsters.He knew the blows for what they were—too quick and too deft to be dangerous.Evidently Sandel was going to rush things from the start.It was to be expected.It was the way of Youth, expending its splendor and excellence in wild insurgence and furious onslaught, overwhelming opposition with its own unlimited glory of strength and desire."
"桑德尔有进有退，时而在这儿，时而在那儿，满场跑动；他步伐轻快、心情急切，就像一个用白皙的肌肤和强健的肌肉砌成的活的奇迹；他用自己的身体编织出一张让人眼花缭乱的攻击网，滑过来，跳过去，像飞梭一样把上千个动作一个接着一个地串联起来，千方百计要摧毁挡住他财路的汤姆·金。汤姆·金就耐着性子挨打。他知道自己该干什么。他现在虽然不再年轻，却学会了对付年轻人。他的想法是，在对方耗费掉一些能量之前，他决定什么也不做，而且他还暗笑，故意低下头，用头顶迎接对方那一记重拳。这样做不厚道，但根据拳击比赛的规则来说，又相当公平。拳击手本应该好好保护自己的指关节，可要是他一定要打对手的头顶，那可就自讨苦吃了。金本来可以把头放低点，让这一拳无关痛痒地落空，但他想起了当初自己比赛的时候，他是怎么在威尔士凶神的头上打坏他的第一个指关节的。现在他只是在按规则比赛。这一低头，桑德尔的一个指关节算报了销。桑德尔现在当然不会在乎。他会毫不在意地继续这样打下去，能打多狠就打多狠，一直到比赛结束。。但过后，等他在拳击赛场上打得久了，明白了其中的厉害，他就会为那个指关节感到痛惜，才会回想起他是怎么把它打在汤姆·金头上的。","Sandel was in and out, here, there, and everywhere, light-footed and eager-hearted, a living wonder of white flesh and stinging muscle that wove itself into a dazzling fabric of attack, slipping and leaping like a flying shuttle from action to action through a thousand actions, all of them centred upon the destruction of Tom King, who stood between him and fortune.And Tom King patiently endured.He knew his business, and he knew Youth now that Youth was no longer his.There was nothing to do till the other lost some of his steam, was his thought, and he grinned to himself as he deliberately ducked so as to receive a heavy blow on the top of his head.It was a wicked thing to do, yet eminently fair according to the rules of the boxing game.A man was supposed to take care of his own knuckles, and, if he insisted on hitting an opponent on the top of the head, he did so at his own peril.King could have ducked lower and let the blow whiz harmlessly past, but he remembered his own early fights and how he smashed his first knuckle on the head of the Welsh Terror.He was but playing the game.That duck had accounted for one of Sandel’s knuckles.Not that Sandel would mind it now.He would go on, superbly regardless, hitting as hard as ever throughout the fight.But later on, when the long ring battles had begun to tell, he would regret that knuckle and look back and remember how he smashed it on Tom King’s head."
"第一回合桑德尔抢尽风头，他旋风式的袭击引得全场观众都为之疯狂。他排山倒海般的拳头完全制住了金，金却一次也没还手。他没出过一次拳，只求用掩护、拦截、躲闪和扭住对方的战术来躲避对方的重击。偶尔他会佯攻，被拳头打中时会晃一下脑袋，他步伐迟缓，从不跳来跳去，也不浪费一丝力气。势必等到桑德尔把青年那股锐气用光，他这个谨慎的老家伙才敢还击。金的所有动作都缓慢、有条不紊又谨慎，而且他那双眼睛眼皮厚重，转动得很慢，让他看上去有一种半睡半醒、茫然若失的神态。但就是这双眼睛将一切尽收眼底。在拳击台上打拼了二十多年，他早就练就了一双火眼金睛。拳头打到眼前来了，这双眼睛也能不眨不动，冷静地观测出拳的距离。","The first round was all Sandel’s, and he had the house yelling with the rapidity of his whirlwind rushes.He overwhelmed King with avalanches of punches, and King did nothing.He never struck once, contenting himself with covering up, blocking and ducking and clinching to avoid punishment.He occasionally feinted, shook his head when the weight of a punch landed, and moved stolidly about, never leaping or springing or wasting an ounce of strength.Sandel must foam the froth of Youth away before discreet Age could dare to retaliate.All King’s movements were slow and methodical, and his heavy-lidded, slow-moving eyes gave him the appearance of being half asleep or dazed.Yet they were eyes that saw everything, that had been trained to see everything through all his twenty years and odd in the ring.They were eyes that did not blink or waver before an impending blow, but that coolly saw and measured distance."
"第一个回合结束后有一分钟的休息时间，他坐在自己的那个场角里，伸展双腿靠上后面的柱子，手臂搭在两旁的围绳上，胸腔和腹部深深地起伏，大口呼吸着助手用毛巾扇过来的空气。他闭着眼睛，听到场外的喊声，“汤姆，你为什么不还手？”很多人都在大声问他。“你不会怕他了吧，是不是？”","Seated in his corner for the minute’s rest at the end of the round, he lay back with outstretched legs, his arms resting on the right angle of the ropes, his chest and abdomen heaving frankly and deeply as he gulped down the air driven by the towels of his seconds.He listened with closed eyes to the voices of the house, “Why don’t yeh fight, Tom?” many were crying.“Yeh ain’t afraid of ’im, are yeh?”"
"“肌肉僵硬了吧，”他听到前排一个男人说道，“他动作快不了啦。我赌桑德尔赢，输了我赔双倍，照英镑算。”","“Muscle-bound,” he heard a man on a front seat comment.“He can’t move quicker.Two to one on Sandel, in quids.”"
"一声锣响，两个人离开各自的场角，走上前来。桑德尔急着开打，上前一口气跑到了全场四分之三的位置上，但金巴不得少走几步。这样省力，正和他意。他没有好好训练，也没填饱肚子，每一步都很金贵。何况他来到拳击场就已经走了两英里的路。和第一回合一样，桑德尔快速袭击，观众气愤不平，想知道金为什么不还手。除了佯攻和几次慢吞吞的出拳，他所做的依然只是抵挡、拖延和扭抱对方。桑德尔想速战速决，金凭借智慧偏不让他得逞。他咧嘴一笑，久经拳场的脸上混杂着羡慕与怜悯，继续凭借着只有老家伙才具备的谨慎，小心地保存着他的实力。桑德尔是青年，像所有青年一样慷慨放纵，尽情挥霍着他的力气。金则是个拳击台上的将才，有的是长年在艰辛的比赛中积累起来的智慧。他目光冷静、头脑清醒，盯住对方，慢慢地移动，等待着桑德尔的气势消散。对于旁观的大多数人来说，金似乎是毫无希望地落后了一大截，他们表示要在桑德尔身上押下三比一的赌注，由此可见他们的态度。但也有少数几个聪明人知道金昔日的辉煌，愿意拿出自己轻易得来的钱跟他们赌一把。","The gong struck and the two men advanced from their corners.Sandel came forward fully three-quarters of the distance, eager to begin again; but King was content to advance the shorter distance.It was in line with his policy of economy.He had not been well trained, and he had not had enough to eat, and every step counted.Besides, he had already walked two miles to the ringside.It was a repetition of the first round, with Sandel attacking like a whirlwind and with the audience indignantly demanding why King did not fight.Beyond feinting and several slowly delivered and ineffectual blows he did nothing save block and stall and clinch.Sandel wanted to make the pace fast, while King, out of his wisdom, refused to accommodate him.He grinned with a certain wistful pathos in his ring-battered countenance, and went on cherishing his strength with the jealousy of which only Age is capable.Sandel was Youth, and he threw his strength away with the munificent abandon of Youth.To King belonged the ring generalship, the wisdom bred of long, aching fights.He watched with cool eyes and head, moving slowly and waiting for Sandel’s froth to foam away.To the majority of the onlookers it seemed as though King was hopelessly outclassed, and they voiced their opinion in offers of three to one on Sandel.But there were wise ones, a few, who knew King of old time, and who covered what they considered easy money."
"第三回合开头还是老样子，主动权还在桑德尔一边，一直是他在不停地出拳。半分钟后，桑德尔因为过分自信，露出了一个破绽。瞬间金的眼睛一亮，同时右手迅速出击。这是他第一次真正的进攻——一记勾拳，他的手臂弯成了拱形，使力道增大，并且压上了身体90度旋转的全部重量。这就像一头看起来恹恹欲睡的狮子突然以闪电般的速度伸出一只爪子。桑德尔下巴边上挨了一拳，像头阉牛似的重重倒下。观众们倒抽一口气，顿生敬畏，喃喃地发出了一片喝彩声。这个男人的肌肉原来并没有僵硬，他还能打出像杵锤一样有力的拳头。","The third round began as usual, one-sided, with Sandel doing all the leading and delivering all the punishment.A half-minute had passed when Sandel, overconfident, left an opening.King’s eyes and right arm flashed in the same instant.It was his first real blow—a hook, with the twisted arch of the arm to make it rigid, and with all the weight of the half-pivoted body behind it.It was like a sleepy-seeming lion suddenly thrusting out a lightning paw.Sandel, caught on the side of the jaw, was felled like a bullock.The audience gasped and murmured awe-stricken applause.The man was not muscle-bound, after all, and he could drive a blow like a trip-hammer."
"桑德尔的身子在颤抖。他翻过身，试图站起来，但他的助手厉声喝住他，让他等着计数。他单膝跪着，做好了起身的准备，等待着，裁判站在他身旁，对着他耳边大声计数。数到九的时候他起身摆出拳击的姿态，对面的汤姆·金却不由懊悔，这一拳要是离下巴尖再近一英寸就好了。那样的话，他就可以把对方击倒，就可以拿着30英镑回家去见老婆孩子了。","Sandel was shaken.He rolled over and attempted to rise, but the sharp yells from his seconds to take the count restrained him.He knelt on one knee, ready to rise, and waited, while the referee stood over him, counting the seconds loudly in his ear.At the ninth he rose in fighting attitude, and Tom King, facing him, knew regret that the blow had not been an inch nearer the point of the jaw.That would have been a knockout, and he could have carried the thirty quid home to the missus and the kiddies."
"这一回合继续，桑德尔第一次尊敬起他的对手，金则和之前一样步伐缓慢，一副昏昏欲睡的样子，一直到规定的三分钟时间结束。这一回合收尾的时候，金看到助手们蹲到围绳外面准备钻进来，这提醒了他，于是他把战斗引到自己的场角。这样当锣响的时候，他可以立刻坐到那张等着他的凳子上，而桑德尔不得不沿着场地的对角线穿过大半个拳击台才能回到自己的场角。这是个小细节，但正是这些小细节累积起来决定了成败。桑德尔不得不迈出更多的步子，消耗更多的能量，还要损失一部分宝贵的休息时间。每一回合开始，金总是懒洋洋地从自己的场角起身，逼着他的对手走过更长的距离。每一回合结束，金又总是巧妙地将比赛引到他自己的场角，好让他可以一打完就坐下来。","The round continued to the end of its three minutes, Sandel for the first time respectful of his opponent and King slow of movement and sleepy-eyed as ever.As the round neared its close, King, warned of the fact by sight of the seconds crouching outside ready for the spring in through the ropes, worked the fight around to his own corner.And when the gong struck, he sat down immediately on the waiting stool, while Sandel had to walk all the way across the diagonal of the square to his own corner.It was a little thing, but it was the sum of little things that counted.Sandel was compelled to walk that many more steps, to give up that much energy, and to lose a part of the precious minute of rest.At the beginning of every round King loafed slowly out from his corner, forcing his opponent to advance the greater distance.The end of every round found the fight maneuvred by King into his own corner so that he could immediately sit down."
"接下来的两个回合，金照样吝啬着自己的拳头，桑德尔的出拳则依旧慷慨大方。后者加快步伐的攻势让金不太舒服，因为这一阵阵挥向他的拳头中有相当一部分都正中要害。然而，尽管那些头脑发热的年轻人都在催他上前攻击，金还是顽固地坚持着自己的拖延战术。第六回合桑德尔再次大意，汤姆·金厉害的右勾拳又一次迅速挥出，正中对方的下巴，桑德尔又一次等着裁判数到九。","Two more rounds went by, in which King was parsimonious of effort and Sandel prodigal.The latter’s attempt to force a fast pace made King uncomfortable, for a fair percentage of the multitudinous blows showered upon him went home.Yet King persisted in his dogged slowness, despite the crying of the young hotheads for him to go in and fight.Again, in the sixth round, Sandel was careless, again Tom King’s fearful right flashed out to the jaw, and again Sandel took the nine seconds count."
"到了第七回合，桑德尔的鼎盛状态已经逝去，他这才静下心来，迎战这场他知道将是自己入行以来遇到的最艰苦的一场比赛。汤姆·金是个老家伙，但比他遇到过的那些老家伙厉害得多——他从来不犯糊涂，精于防守，拳头的狠劲儿比得上一根有节的铁棍，而且无论哪只手都能一拳把对手击倒。尽管如此，汤姆·金还是不敢频繁出拳。他从来没忘记他那些打伤的指关节，他明白，要想让这些指关节撑过整场比赛，他每出一拳都需要精打细算。正当他坐在自己的场角，看向对面的对手时，他突然想到，要是有人能集他的聪明才智和桑德尔的年轻力壮于一身，准会成为一个重量级的世界冠军。但问题就在这里。桑德尔永远成不了世界冠军。他缺乏智慧，而对他来说能得到智慧的唯一方式就是用青春去交换；而等他拥有了智慧，青春也已经一去不回了。","By the seventh round Sandel’s pink of condition was gone, and he settled down to what he knew was to be the hardest fight in his experience.Tom King was an old un, but a better old un than he had ever encountered—an old un who never lost his head, who was remarkably able at defence, whose blows had the impact of a knotted club, and who had a knockout in either hand.Nevertheless, Tom King dared not hit often.He never forgot his battered knuckles, and knew that every hit must count if the knuckles were to last out the fight.As he sat in his corner, glancing across at his opponent, the thought came to him that the sum of his wisdom and Sandel’s youth would constitute a world’s champion heavyweight.But that was the trouble.Sandel would never become a world champion.He lacked the wisdom, and the only way for him to get it was to buy it with Youth; and when wisdom was his, Youth would have been spent in buying it."
"金利用上了他知道的每一个有利条件。他从不错失任何扭住对方的机会，而且通常在扭作一团之后他都会用肩膀狠狠撞向对方的肋骨。从理论上说，在拳击台上，肩膀与拳头的杀伤力不相上下，但省力要多得多。而且，扭打的时候金会把自己的重量压在对方身上，不肯松手。这样就逼得裁判过来干涉，把他们分开，桑德尔没学会偷闲，这种时候还总在一旁协助。桑德尔总是忍不住神气地挥动胳膊、显摆肌肉。要是另一方冲过来扭住他，拿肩膀撞他的肋骨，头卡在他的左臂下面，桑德尔几乎总是把右拳从自己背后挥过去，打向那颗伸出来的脑袋。这是个漂亮的打法，观众十分欣赏，但并不危险，因此也只是浪费力气。但桑德尔不知疲倦，也不清楚自己的极限，金只是咧嘴笑着，顽强地坚持着。","King took every advantage he knew.He never missed an opportunity to clinch, and in effecting most of the clinches his shoulder drove stiffly into the other’s ribs.In the philosophy of the ring a shoulder was as good as a punch so far as damage was concerned, and a great deal better so far as concerned expenditure of effort.Also, in the clinches King rested his weight on his opponent, and was loath to let go.This compelled the interference of the referee, who tore them apart, always assisted by Sandel, who had not yet learned to rest.He could not refrain from using those glorious flying arms and writhing muscles of his, and when the other rushed into a clinch, striking shoulder against ribs, and with head resting under Sandel’s left arm, Sandel almost invariably swung his right behind his own back and into the projecting face.It was a clever stroke, much admired by the audience, but it was not dangerous, and was, therefore, just that much wasted strength.But Sandel was tireless and unaware of limitations, and King grinned and doggedly endured."
"桑德尔还使出了一种用右拳猛击对手身体的打法，让金看起来似乎挨了不少打，但其实，在被对方拳头打到之前的一瞬间，金已经将左拳撞上了对方的肱二头肌，这种巧妙的手法只有看拳的老手才懂得欣赏。没错，桑德尔的拳头次次都打中了，但每次都因为肱二头肌上这一撞的缓冲，失去了应有的力道。到第九个回合时，金在一分钟内三次把右臂弯成拱形，用一记勾拳，打中对方的下巴。一连三次，桑德尔的身体都重重倒在了毯子上。每次他都等足了九秒才起身，有些摇摇晃晃、神志不清，但依然强壮。他动作已经没那么快了，可浪费的力气也少了。他打得很艰难，可他的本钱，也就是青春，还在给他源源不断地提供能量。金的本钱则是经验。他的活力渐渐消逝，精力也变得不济了，但他通过长期的比赛得到了精明和智慧，学会了谨慎地驾驭自己的力量。他不仅学会了永远不做一个多余的动作，还学会了怎么诱使对手浪费气力。他反复利用四肢和身体作出攻击的样子，不断地诱骗着桑德尔，让他一会儿跳开，一会儿闪躲，一会儿还击。金要休息，但他决不允许桑德尔休息。这就是老手的策略。","Sandel developed a fierce right to the body, which made it appear that King was taking an enormous amount of punishment, and it was only the old ringsters who appreciated the deft touch of King’s left glove to the other’s biceps just before the impact of the blow.It was true, the blow landed each time; but each time it was robbed of its power by that touch on the biceps.In the ninth round, three times inside a minute, King’s right hooked its twisted arch to the jaw; and three times Sandel’s body, heavy as it was, was levelled to the mat.Each time he took the nine seconds allowed him and rose to his feet, shaken and jarred, but still strong.He had lost much of his speed, and he wasted less effort.He was fighting grimly; but he continued to draw upon his chief asset, which was Youth.King’s chief asset was experience.As his vitality had dimmed and his vigor abated, he had replaced them with cunning, with wisdom born of the long fights and with a careful shepherding of strength.Not alone had he learned never to make a superfluous movement, but he had learned how to seduce an opponent into throwing his strength away.Again and again, by feint of foot and hand and body he continued to inveigle Sandel into leaping back, ducking, or countering.King rested, but he never permitted Sandel to rest.It was the strategy of Age."
"第十回合没打多久，金就开始用左直拳攻打对方的脸部，来阻挡对方的急攻，桑德尔已经谨慎起来，见势立刻收回左拳，低头一闪，同时右手一挥，对着金的头部一侧送出一记结实的勾拳。这一拳打得高了，没有打中要害，但金刚一挨拳，立刻就感觉到一阵熟悉的昏眩，仿佛被一片黑纱蒙住了意识。在那一瞬间，或者不如说，在那短暂得不能再短暂的一瞬间，他的生命停止了。这一刻，他看到他的对手闪出了他的视野，周围那一张张正观看着比赛的白色面孔也不见了；下一刻，他却又再次看到了他的对手和观众席上的面孔。感觉就好像他睡了一觉，刚刚重新睁开眼睛，但失去意识的时间短得几乎难以察觉，他没来得及倒下。观众只看到他晃了一下，膝盖一软，之后又见他恢复过来，用左肩紧紧地护住下巴。","Early in the tenth round King began stopping the other’s rushes with straight lefts to the face, and Sandel, grown wary, responded by drawing the left, then by ducking it and delivering his right in a swinging hook to the side of the head.It was too high up to be vitally effective; but when first it landed, King knew the old, familiar descent of the black veil of unconsciousness across his mind.For the instant, or for the slightest fraction of an instant, rather, he ceased.In the one moment he saw his opponent ducking out of his field of vision and the background of white, watching faces; in the next moment he again saw his opponent and the background of faces.It was as if he had slept for a time and just opened his eyes again, and yet the interval of unconsciousness was so microscopically short that there had been no time for him to fall.The audience saw him totter and his knees give, and then saw him recover and tuck his chin deeper into the shelter of his left shoulder."
"桑德尔这一招用了好几次，想让金一直处于半昏迷状态，然而后者终于想出了一个以攻为守的办法。他左手佯攻，却又后退半步，同时使出右臂全部的力量打出一个上勾拳。他把时间算得真准，使得桑德尔低头闪躲之时，这一拳正好直直迎上他的脸，打得桑德尔腾空飞起，身体后仰，头和肩膀一起撞到了垫子上。金这样得手了两次，接着就放开手脚，用拳头把对手逼到了围绳上。他不给桑德尔机会休息，也不让他有机会振作，只是一拳又一拳地砸过去，直到全场的观众都站起来，不断向他报以雷鸣般的喝彩。但桑德尔的力气和耐力是一流的，他还没倒下。看起来桑德尔铁定要被打晕过去，场子边上的一个警察局副巡官看到这可怕的场面，吓了一跳，连忙站起来要阻止这场比赛。这时一声锣响，本回合结束。桑德尔踉踉跄跄地走回自己的场角，向副巡官解释说他体质好，挨得住。为了证明这一点，他还做了两个后空翻，让那个警官没了意见。","Several times Sandel repeated the blow, keeping King partially dazed, and then the latter worked out his defence, which was also a counter.Feinting with his left he took a half-step backward, at the same time upper cutting with the whole strength of his right.So accurately was it timed that it landed squarely on Sandel’s face in the full, downward sweep of the duck, and Sandel lifted in the air and curled backward, striking the mat on his head and shoulders.Twice King achieved this, then turned loose and hammered his opponent to the ropes.He gave Sandel no chance to rest or to set himself, but smashed blow in upon blow till the house rose to its feet and the air was filled with an unbroken roar of applause.But Sandel’s strength and endurance were superb, and he continued to stay on his feet.A knockout seemed certain, and a captain of police, appalled at the dreadful punishment, arose by the ringside to stop the fight.The gong struck for the end of the round and Sandel staggered to his corner, protesting to the captain that he was sound and strong.To prove it, he threw two back air-springs, and the police captain gave in."
"汤姆·金这时正靠在自己的场角里喘得厉害，看到这一幕，他非常失望。如果比赛终止了，裁判将不得不向他宣布裁定，奖金也就归他了。他跟桑德尔不同，他打拳不是为了荣耀，也不是为了前程，只是为了那30英镑。但现在，只需要休息一分钟桑德尔就会恢复。","Tom King, leaning back in his corner and breathing hard, was disappointed.If the fight had been stopped, the referee, perforce, would have rendered him the decision and the purse would have been his.Unlike Sandel, he was not fighting for glory or career, but for thirty quid.And now Sandel would recuperate in the minute of rest."
"年轻就是本钱——这句话闪现在金德脑海里。他记得第一次听到这句话是在他打倒斯托舍·比尔的那个晚上。那场拳击赛后，给他买酒的阔少拍着他的肩膀就说的这句话。年轻就是本钱！那个人说的没错。很久以前的那个晚上，他就是年轻的那个。今天晚上，年轻的那个却坐到了对面的位置。而他自己，他现在已经打了半个小时，他可是有一把年纪的人了。要是他像桑德尔一样打法，怕是一刻钟也坚持不下来。可最要命的是他没法恢复。因为他那些鼓起的血管，还有那颗疲乏的心脏，靠着回合之间那点儿休息时间，他根本没有办法重新振作。而且一开始他的力气就不够。他双腿沉重，而且已经开始抽筋了。他不该走上两英里路来比赛的。还有那块他早上一起床就想吃的牛排。他心里恨死了那个不肯给他赊账的肉铺老板。一个老人饿着肚子是很难打赢的。区区一块牛排，顶多值几个便士，而对他来说，却意味着30英镑。","Youth will be served—this saying flashed into King’s mind, and he remembered the first time he had heard it, the night when he had put away Stowsher Bill.The toff who had bought him a drink after the fight and patted him on the shoulder had used those words.Youth will be served!The toff was right.And on that night in the long ago he had been Youth.To-night Youth sat in the opposite corner.As for himself, he had been fighting for half an hour now, and he was an old man.Had he fought like Sandel, he would not have lasted fifteen minutes.But the point was that he did not recuperate.Those upstanding arteries and that sorely tried heart would not enable him to gather strength in the intervals between the rounds.And he had not had sufficient strength in him to begin with.His legs were heavy under him and beginning to cramp.He should not have walked those two miles to the fight.And there was the steak which he had got up longing for that morning.A great and terrible hatred rose up in him for the butchers who had refused him credit.It was hard for an old man to go into a fight without enough to eat.And a piece of steak was such a little thing, a few pennies at best; yet it meant thirty quid to him."
"第十一个回合的开场锣声一响，桑德尔就为了显示自己那早就不复存在的活力，发起了一阵猛攻。金很清楚是怎么回事——这不过是虚张声势罢了，是像拳击比赛本身一样古老的把戏。为了保护自己，他扭住对方，然后又松开手，让桑德尔重新摆开阵势。这正是金想要的。他左手佯攻，引得对手低头一躲，同时向上挥出勾拳，再后退半步，一记上勾拳迎上桑德尔的脸，把他撂倒在垫子上。那之后他就不让对方歇着了，自己挨了拳但送出的拳头更多。他把桑德尔逼到绳子上，一边从各个方向用各种拳法揍他，一边挣开他的纠缠，或者干脆用拳头阻止他扭抱的企图，而且每次桑德尔快倒下的时候，他都会用一只手向上撑起他，另一只手随即把他打得贴在围绳上，让他倒不下去。","With the gong that opened the eleventh round, Sandel rushed, making a show of freshness which he did not really possess.King knew it for what it was—a bluff as old as the game itself.He clinched to save himself, then, going free, allowed Sandel to get set.This was what King desired.He feinted with his left, drew the answering duck and swinging upward hook, then made the half-step backward, delivered the upper cut full to the face and crumpled Sandel over to the mat.After that he never let him rest, receiving punishment himself, but inflicting far more, smashing Sandel to the ropes, hooking and driving all manner of blows into him, tearing away from his clinches or punching him out of attempted clinches, and ever when Sandel would have fallen, catching him with one uplifting hand and with the other immediately smashing him into the ropes where he could not fall."
"这时全场观众都疯狂了，这里成了他的天下，几乎每一个声音都在喊：“加油，汤姆！”“打垮他！打垮他！”“你就要赢了，汤姆！你就要赢了！”一个旋风般的收尾马上就要来临，观众花钱到拳击台边上，想看的就是这个。","The house by this time had gone mad, and it was his house, nearly every voice yelling: “Go it, Tom!”“Get ’im! Get ’im!”“You’ve got ’im, Tom!You’ve got ’im!”It was to be a whirlwind finish, and that was what a ringside audience paid to see."
"汤姆·金已经攒了一个半小时的力气，现在则毫不吝惜地把全身力气一下子都拿了出来。这是他唯一的机会——现在不赢就再也赢不了了。他的力气消耗得很快，他只希望在用尽最后一丝力气之前，能把对手打垮。他一面继续卖力攻击，一面冷静地估量自己出拳的轻重和杀伤力，这时他意识到桑德尔是一个很难打倒的对手。他的持久力和忍耐力都是顶尖级的，而且这青春的持久力和忍耐力从没遭到过任何损伤。无疑，桑德尔前途无量。他在这方面极有天赋。只有这样耐打的人才能成为成功的拳击手。","And Tom King, who for half an hour had conserved his strength, now expended it prodigally in the one great effort he knew he had in him.It was his one chance—now or not at all.His strength was waning fast, and his hope was that before the last of it ebbed out of him he would have beaten his opponent down for the count.And as he continued to strike and force, coolly estimating the weight of his blows and the quality of the damage wrought, he realized how hard a man Sandel was to knock out.Stamina and endurance were his to an extreme degree, and they were the virgin stamina and endurance of Youth.Sandel was certainly a coming man.He had it in him.Only out of such rugged fibre were successful fighters fashioned."
"桑德尔已晕晕乎乎站不稳了，可汤姆·金的腿也在抽筋，指关节也支持不住了。但他还是咬着牙打出猛拳，每一拳都把他的手打得疼上加疼。虽然现在他几乎没挨拳头，虚弱下去的速度却和对手没什么两样。他的拳头每次都打中了要害，可是失去了从前的分量，而且每一拳打出来都要付出极大的努力。他的腿像灌了铅，拖沓的步伐显而易见。桑德尔的支持者们看到这个都高兴起来，开始大声给他们下注的人鼓劲儿。","Sandel was reeling and staggering, but Tom King’s legs were cramping and his knuckles going back on him.Yet he steeled himself to strike the fierce blows, every one of which brought anguish to his tortured hands.Though now he was receiving practically no punishment, he was weakening as rapidly as the other.His blows went home, but there was no longer the weight behind them, and each blow was the result of a severe effort of will.His legs were like lead, and they dragged visibly under him; while Sandel’s backers, cheered by this symptom, began calling encouragement to their man."
"金被这情形激发出一股劲儿。他连打了两拳——一记左拳，打向心窝，却打高了一点，另一记右拳横过下巴。拳都不重，但桑德尔已经又软又晕，所以还是被打倒了，躺在地上哆嗦。裁判站到他旁边，在他耳边大声数着那些致命的秒数。如果在喊到十之前他没能站起来，他就输了。全场观众都静静地站着。金腿直打哆嗦，勉强撑着。他感到一阵剧烈的头晕目眩，观众的脸好似一片海洋，在他眼前上下沉浮摇晃，而他耳边，裁判的数秒声仿佛从很远的地方传来。但他认定这场比赛是自己赢了。一个挨了这么多拳头的人不可能还会站得起来。","King was spurred to a burst of effort.He delivered two blows in succession—a left, a trifle too high, to the solar plexus, and a right cross to the jaw.They were not heavy blows, yet so weak and dazed was Sandel that he went down and lay quivering.The referee stood over him, shouting the count of the fatal seconds in his ear.If before the tenth second was called, he did not rise, the fight was lost.The house stood in hushed silence.King rested on trembling legs.A mortal dizziness was upon him, and before his eyes the sea of faces sagged and swayed, while to his ears, as from a remote distance, came the count of the referee.Yet he looked upon the fight as his.It was impossible that a man so punished could rise."
"只有青春可以站起来，而桑德尔站了起来。数到四的时候他翻身脸朝下趴着，胡乱地抓着围绳。数到七的时候他已经跪了起来，就地喘口气，他肩上的脑袋无力地摇晃着。当裁判喊道“九！”时，桑德尔直直地站了起来，摆开一个标准的招架姿势，左臂护着脸，右手护着腹部。这样护住要害之后，他摇晃着向前靠近金，准备扭住对方给自己争取更多的时间。","Only Youth could rise, and Sandel rose.At the fourth second he rolled over on his face and groped blindly for the ropes.By the seventh second he had dragged himself to his knee, where he rested, his head rolling groggily on his shoulders.As the referee cried “Nine!” Sandel stood upright, in proper stalling position, his left arm wrapped about his face, his right wrapped about his stomach.Thus were his vital points guarded, while he lurched forward toward King in the hope of effecting a clinch and gaining more time."
"桑德尔一起来，金就上去揍他，但他送出的两拳都被护在前面的手臂挡住了。接下来，桑德尔就和他扭在了一起，拼命抱住他不放，裁判花了很大的力气才把两人拉开。金也帮着挣脱对方的扭抱。他知道年轻人恢复得有多快，也知道只要不让他恢复，桑德尔就会败给自己。一记狠拳就可以搞定。桑德尔会败给他，绝对会败给他。他无论是在谋略上、拳法上，还是在点数上都胜他一筹。桑德尔从扭抱中挣脱出来，摇摇晃晃，成败得失全在毫发之间。一记好拳就能把他打翻在地，让他失去意识。汤姆·金忽然悲从中来，想起了那块牛排，要是能有那块牛排支撑他打出这必不可少的一拳，那该多好呀。他使出全身力气，打出这一拳，可惜不够重也不够快。桑德尔晃了晃，但没有倒，踉跄着退回围绳，靠在上面。金拖着脚步跟上，忍着身体散架似的剧痛，又打出了一拳。但他的身体已经不听使唤了。仅剩的奋战的智慧也因为筋疲力竭而逐渐消逝。这一拳原本是朝着下巴打过去的，却没有高过肩膀。他本想打得高一些，但疲乏的肌肉已经不受控制了。而且因为这一拳的反作用力，汤姆·金自己往后打了个趔趄，几乎摔倒。他又勉强打出一拳。这次他的拳头完全落空，因为虚弱得厉害，他一头栽在桑德尔身上，和他扭抱在一起，以免自己倒在地上。","At the instant Sandel arose, King was at him, but the two blows he delivered were muffled on the stalled arms.The next moment Sandel was in the clinch and holding on desperately while the referee strove to drag the two men apart.King helped to force himself free.He knew the rapidity with which Youth recovered, and he knew that Sandel was his if he could prevent that recovery.One stiff punch would do it.Sandel was his, indubitably his.He had outgeneralled him, outfought him, outpointed him.Sandel reeled out of the clinch, balanced on the hair line between defeat or survival.One good blow would topple him over and down and out.And Tom King, in a flash of bitterness, remembered the piece of steak and wished that he had it then behind that necessary punch he must deliver.He nerved himself for the blow, but it was not heavy enough nor swift enough.Sandel swayed, but did not fall, staggering back to the ropes and holding on.King staggered after him, and, with a pang like that of dissolution, delivered another blow.But his body had deserted him.All that was left of him was a fighting intelligence that was dimmed and clouded from exhaustion.The blow that was aimed for the jaw struck no higher than the shoulder.He had willed the blow higher, but the tired muscles had not been able to obey.And, from the impact of the blow, Tom King himself reeled back and nearly fell.Once again he strove.This time his punch missed altogether, and, from absolute weakness, he fell against Sandel and clinched, holding on to him to save himself from sinking to the floor."
"金没有挣开的意思。他已经筋疲力尽了。他大势已去。年轻才是本钱。甚至在扭住对方的时候，他仍然能感觉到桑德尔的体力正在变强。等到裁判把他们拉开时，果不其然，他又眼睁睁地看着青春恢复了。每过一刹那，桑德尔都变得更加强壮。他的拳头起初软弱无力，不起作用，现在却变得又狠又准。汤姆·金昏花的眼睛看见那戴着手套的拳头砸向他的下巴，他使劲抬起手臂去挡。他看到了危险，也想努力招架，可他的手臂太沉了。手臂就像是灌了一英担的铅。他拼了命地使劲，可手就是举不起来。然后，那个戴着手套的拳头打中了他。他听到啪的一声，如同电光一闪，同时他眼前一黑，失去了意识。","King did not attempt to free himself.He had shot his bolt.He was gone.And Youth had been served.Even in the clinch he could feel Sandel growing stronger against him.When the referee thrust them apart, there, before his eyes, he saw Youth recuperate.From instant to instant Sandel grew stronger.His punches, weak and futile at first, became stiff and accurate.Tom King’s bleared eyes saw the gloved fist driving at his jaw, and he willed to guard it by interposing his arm.He saw the danger, willed the act; but the arm was too heavy.It seemed burdened with a hundredweight of lead.It would not lift itself, and he strove to lift it with his soul.Then the gloved fist landed home.He experienced a sharp snap that was like an electric spark, and, simultaneously, the veil of blackness enveloped him."
"当他再次睁开眼睛时，他已经置身自己的场角，听到观众的喊声，就像邦迪海滩上海浪的咆哮声。他后脑压在一条湿海绵上，锡德·沙利文正往他脸上和胸口喷冷水，让他苏醒过来。他的手套已经被摘下，而桑德尔正弯下腰来和他握手。他不恨这个打倒他的男人，他真心回握，用力到他的破指节受不了为止。然后，桑德尔走回场地的中央，观众停止了喧嚣，听他讲话。他接受了年轻的普隆托的挑战，还提出把赌注加大到100磅。金无动于衷地看着他们，等待他的助手们揩去他身上的汗，擦干他的脸，为他离开拳击台做好准备。他觉得饿。不是寻常的叫人胃痛的那种饿，而是一种极度的无力昏迷，是胃部的一种悸动，随即传至全身。他回想起比赛中有那么一刻，他把桑德尔打得摇摇欲坠，差一点儿就把他打输了。哎，一块牛排就能顶用了！生死一拳，缺的不过是一块牛排，现在他却输了。这全都是因为一块牛排。","When he opened his eyes again he was in his corner, and he heard the yelling of the audience like the roar of the surf at Bondi Beach.A wet sponge was being pressed against the base of his brain, and Sid Sullivan was blowing cold water in a refreshing spray over his face and chest.His gloves had already been removed, and Sandel, bending over him, was shaking his hand.He bore no ill-will toward the man who had put him out, and he returned the grip with a heartiness that made his battered knuckles protest.Then Sandel stepped to the centre of the ring and the audience hushed its pandemonium to hear him accept young Pronto’s challenge and offer to increase the side bet to one hundred pounds.King looked on apathetically while his seconds mopped the streaming water from him, dried his face, and prepared him to leave the ring.He felt hungry.It was not the ordinary, gnawing kind, but a great faintness, a palpitation at the pit of the stomach that communicated itself to all his body.He remembered back into the fight to the moment when he had Sandel swaying and tottering on the hair-line balance of defeat.Ah, that piece of steak would have done it!He had lacked just that for the decisive blow, and he had lost.It was all because of the piece of steak."
"他的助手们搀扶着他，帮他钻过围绳。他挣开他们，自己穿过围绳，跳下台，重重地落到地面上。助手们在前面拥挤的中心走廊给他开出一条道来，他跟在后面。他离开更衣室到街上的时候，一个站在大厅入口处的小伙子对他说了一句话。","His seconds were half-supporting him as they helped him through the ropes.He tore free from them, ducked through the ropes unaided, and leaped heavily to the floor, following on their heels as they forced a passage for him down the crowded centre aisle.Leaving the dressing-room for the street, in the entrance to the hall, some young fellow spoke to him."
"“你有那个机会的时候，为什么不打垮他？”那个小伙子问。","“W’y didn’t yuh go in an’ get ’im when yuh ’ad ’im?” the young fellow asked."
"“哦，滚开！”汤姆·金一面说，一面走下阶梯，来到人行道上。","“Aw, go to hell!” said Tom King, and passed down the steps to the sidewalk."
"街角酒店的门大敞着，他看见灯光和微笑着的女招待，听到很多人正在讨论这次比赛，还听到吧台上的钱币叮当作响。有人叫他去喝一杯。他显然犹豫了一下，但还是谢绝了，继续赶他的路。","The doors of the public house at the corner were swinging wide, and he saw the lights and the smiling barmaids, heard the many voices discussing the fight and the prosperous chink of money on the bar.Somebody called to him to have a drink.He hesitated perceptibly, then refused and went on his way."
"他包里一个铜子儿也没有，回家的两英里又显得那么长。他实在是老了。穿过多曼公园的时候，他忽然在一张长凳上坐下了，一想到妻子还在家等着他，等着听比赛的结果，他就心烦意乱。那比什么判败击倒都要可怕，几乎让人无法面对。","He had not a copper in his pocket, and the two-mile walk home seemed very long.He was certainly getting old.Crossing the Domain, he sat down suddenly on a bench, unnerved by the thought of the missus sitting up for him, waiting to learn the outcome of the fight.That was harder than any knockout, and it seemed almost impossible to face."
"他觉得很虚弱，身上酸痛，打伤的指关节发出了警告，就算他能找个力气活儿干，也还要等上一个星期才能拿得起镐柄或是铲子。胃部因饥饿产生的悸动让他感到一阵恶心。在不幸面前他终于崩溃了，眼里涌出了平日不轻弹的泪水。他用手蒙着脸，一边哭泣，一边想起斯托舍·比尔，还有很久以前那个拳赛之夜自己与他对战的情景。可怜的老斯托舍·比尔！他现在终于明白为什么比尔会在更衣室里哭泣。","He felt weak and sore, and the pain of his smashed knuckles warned him that, even if he could find a job at navvy work, it would be a week before he could grip a pick handle or a shovel.The hunger palpitation at the pit of the stomach was sickening.His wretchedness overwhelmed him, and into his eyes came an unwonted moisture.He covered his face with his hands, and, as he cried, he remembered Stowsher Bill and how he had served him that night in the long ago.Poor old Stowsher Bill!He could understand now why Bill had cried in the dressing-room."
