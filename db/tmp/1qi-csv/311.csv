"夜阑","Late at Night"
"作者：曼斯菲尔德","by Katherine Mansfield "
"（弗吉尼亚坐在火边。她出门时穿戴的衣物被丢在一把椅子上；她的靴子在壁炉挡板里微微地冒着热气。）","(Virginia is seated by the fire.Her outdoor things are thrown on a chair; her boots are faintly steaming in the fender.)"
"弗吉尼亚（把信放下）：我根本就不喜欢这封信——一点也不。我想知道他这是想成心冷落我——还是这就是他的作风。（读信）。“非常感谢你送我的袜子。因为最近我已经有五双别人送的袜子了，所以我把你送我的给了我公司的一个朋友，我确信你听了这个一定会很高兴的。”不，这不是我的想象。他一定是成心的；这是种可怕的冷落。","Virginia (laying the letter down): I don’t like this letter at all—not at all.I wonder if he means it to be so snubbing—or if it’s just his way.(Reads).“Many thanks for the socks.As I have had five pairs sent me lately, I am sure you will be pleased to hear I gave yours to a friend in my company.”No; it can’t be my fancy.He must have meant it; it is a dreadful snub."
"唉，我真希望没有给他寄去那封信，告诉他要保重。我愿意付出任何代价来拿回那封信。我又是在一个星期天的晚上写的信——真是太欠考虑了。我真不应该在星期天晚上写信——我总是管不住自己。我真想不通为什么星期天晚上总是对我有如此奇怪的影响。我真是渴望可以写信给什么人——或者去爱什么人。是的，就是这样。星期天晚上总是让我感觉既难过又充满爱意。莫名其妙，不是么！","Oh, I wish I hadn’t sent him that letter telling him to take care of himself.I’d give anything to have that letter back.I wrote it on a Sunday evening, too—that was so fatal.I never ought to write letters on Sunday evenings—I always let myself go so.I can’t think why Sunday evenings always have such a funny effect on me.I simply yearn to have someone to write to—or to love.Yes, that’s it; they make me feel sad and full of love.Funny, isn’t it!"
"我必须再去一次教堂不可；坐在火前冥想真是太不应该了。那儿还有赞美诗，可以让人非常安全地沉浸其中。（她低声吟唱）“为了那些我们最亲爱的和最宝贵的人”——（但是她的视线落在了信中的下一句话上）。“能亲手为我织袜子，你真是太好了！”确实！确实，太过分了！男人们傲慢得令人厌恶！他竟然以为是我亲手织的袜子。嗨，我几乎都不认识他；我只和他讲过几次话罢了。我凭什么要给他织袜子呢？他一定是以为我陷得很深，想要那样把自己送上门去。既然他几乎是一个陌生人，那么给他织袜子确实就是把自己送上门了。给他随便买一双就完全是另一回事了。不，我决不会再给他写信了——肯定不会。而且，另外，写信会有什么用呢？我可能真会对他着迷，而他却始终对我无动于衷。男人都这样。","I must start going to church again; it’s fatal sitting in front of the fire and thinking.There are the hymns, too; one can let oneself go so safely in the hymns.(She croons) “And then for those our Dearest and our Best”—(but her eye lights on the next sentence in the letter).“It was most kind of you to have knitted them yourself.”Really!Really, that is too much!Men are abominably arrogant!He actually imagines that I knitted them myself.Why, I hardly know him; I’ve only spoken to him a few times.Why on earth should I knit him socks?He must think I am far gone to throw myself at his head like that.For it certainly is throwing oneself at a man’s head to knit him socks—if he’s almost a stranger.Buying him an odd pair is a different matter altogether.No; I shan’t write to him again—that’s definite.And, besides, what would be the use?I might get really keen on him and he’d never care a straw for me.Men don’t."
"我很疑惑为什么到了某种地步后，我似乎总会让人反感。莫名其妙，不是么！起初他们喜欢我，他们认为我不寻常，或是与众不同；但是紧接着我想对他们表示一下——即便是给他们一个暗示——我喜欢他们，他们就似乎受了惊吓，都消失不见了。我想以后我必将为此事苦恼。或许他们不知怎的就意识到我太多情了。或许就是这个把他们吓住了。唉，我感觉我有无限的、无限的爱给予什么人——我会全心全意、无微不至地照顾他们——保护他们——不让一切讨厌的事靠近他们——让他们觉得我生来就是为了帮他们完成一切他们想做的事。只要我感觉有什么人需要我，我能帮上谁的忙，我就会变成另一个人。是的，对我来说，这就是生命的奥秘——感受被爱，感受被需要，知道有人事事都要完全依赖我——永远。而且我身强体壮，又比大多数女人要富有得多。我确定大多数女人都没有如此强烈的渴望——表现自己。我看就是这样——和含苞待放的花朵差不多。在黑暗中，我整个人都蜷缩起来，与世隔绝，无人怜惜。我猜想这就是我为何对植物、生病的动物和小鸟格外怜惜的原因——这是一种排遣一腔痴情、派遣这份难以承载的爱的方式。还有，当然了，它们是那么无助——这是另一回事了。但是我有一种感觉，如果一个男人真正爱上了你，他也会变得那样无助。是的，我确定，男人都是十分无助的……","I wonder why it is that after a certain point I always seem to repel people.Funny, isn’t it!They like me at first; they think me uncommon, or original; but then immediately I want to show them—even give them a hint—that I like them, they seem to get frightened and begin to disappear.I suppose I shall get embittered about it later on.Perhaps they know somehow that I’ve got so much to give.Perhaps it’s that that frightens them.Oh, I feel I’ve got such boundless, boundless love to give to somebody—I would care for somebody so utterly and so completely—watch over them—keep everything horrible away—and make them feel that if ever they wanted anything done I lived to do it.If only I felt that somebody wanted me, that I was of use to somebody, I should become a different person.Yes; that is the secret of life for me—to feel loved, to feel wanted, to know that somebody leaned on me for everything absolutely—for ever.And I am strong, and far, far richer than most women.I am sure that most women don’t have this tremendous yearning to—express themselves.I suppose that’s it—to come into flower, almost.I’m all folded and shut away in the dark, and nobody cares.I suppose that is why I feel this tremendous tenderness for plants and sick animals and birds—it’s one way of getting rid of this wealth, this burden of love.And then, of course, they are so helpless—that’s another thing.But I have a feeling that if a man were really in love with you he’d be just as helpless, too.Yes, I am sure that men are very helpless..."
"不知为什么，今晚我一直想哭。当然不是因为这封信，它远没那么重要。但是我还是想知道，事情会不会转变，或者是否直到我老去都还要像现在这样——只是盼啊盼啊。如今我已不像曾经那么年轻了。我已经长了皱纹，而且我的皮肤也大不如从前了。按普通的审美标准来说，我从来没有真正漂亮过，但是我曾经的确有细致的皮肤和一头秀发——而且我走路的姿势也很好看。今天我只是瞥了一眼镜子中的自己——弯腰驼背，步伐迟缓……我显得又邋遢又衰老。啊，不；或许还没有那么糟糕，我总是夸张地说自己。但是我现在对待事情挑剔而刁钻——我确定那是上了年纪的标志。就拿风来说——现在我已经不能忍受被风吹，我还讨厌把脚弄湿。我以前从不在乎那些事——我曾经还陶醉于其中——它们使我感觉在某种程度上和大自然融为一体了。但我现在是气急了想哭，真渴望有什么东西能让我忘了这些。我猜想，这就是女人为何要酗酒了。莫名其妙，不是么！","I don’t know why, I feel inclined to cry tonight.Certainly not because of this letter; it isn’t half important enough.But I keep wondering if things will ever change or if I shall go on like this until I am old—just wanting and wanting.I’m not as young as I was even now.I’ve got lines, and my skin isn’t a bit what it used to be.I never was really pretty, not in the ordinary way, but I did have lovely skin and lovely hair—and I walked well.I only caught sight of myself in a glass today—stooping and shuffling along…I looked dowdy and elderly.Well, no; perhaps not quite as bad as that; I always exaggerate about myself.But I’m faddy about things now—that’s a sign of age, I’m sure.The wind—I can’t bear being blown about in the wind now; and I hate having wet feet.I never used to care about those things—I used almost to revel in them—they made me feel so one with Nature in a way.But now I get cross and I want to cry and I yearn for something to make me forget.I suppose that’s why women take to drink.Funny, isn’t it!"
"火就要熄灭了。我要烧掉这封信。对我来说，它算什么？呸！我才不在乎。对我来说，它算什么？另外五个女人可以送袜子给他。而且，我认为他和我所想象的一点也不一样。我就仅能听他说一句：“亲手为我织袜子，你真是太好了。”他的声音真迷人。我想，是他的声音吸引了我——还有他的双手，它们看上去是那么强壮有力——那是一双男子汉的手！唉，好吧，不要再对此感伤了；烧了它吧！……不，现在不行了——火已经熄灭了。我要去睡觉了。我想知道他是不是真的在成心冷落我。唉，我累了。现在，当我睡觉的时候，我常想拿衣服蒙住头——大哭一场。莫名其妙，不是么！","The fire is going out.I’ll burn this letter.What’s it to me?Pooh! I don’t care.What is it to me?The five other women can send him socks!And I don’t suppose he was a bit what I imagined.I can just hear him saying, “It was most kind of you, to have knitted them yourself.”He has a fascinating voice.I think it was his voice that attracted me to him—and his hands; they looked so strong—they were such man’s hands.Oh, well, don’t sentimentalise over it; burn it!...No, I can’t now—the fire’s gone out.I’ll go to bed.I wonder if he really meant to be snubbing.Oh, I am tired.Often when I go to bed now I want to pull the clothes over my head—and just cry.Funny, isn’t it!"
