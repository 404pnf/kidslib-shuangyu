"福尔摩斯谢幕演出","His Last Bow"
"时间是八月二日，晚上九点。这是世界历史上最可怕的一个八月[^1]，周遭的一切凝神敛息，闷热凝滞的空气中弥漫着一种模模糊糊的预感，让人油然想到，上帝的诅咒马上就会降临这个堕落的世界。太阳早已落山，远远的西方却低低地横亘着一抹殷红的残霞，宛如一道未愈的伤口。上方是熠熠生辉的群星，下方则是海湾里来往船只的闪烁灯火。两位著名的德国人伫立在花园小径的石栏旁边，身后是一座又长又矮、山墙林立的房屋。他俩正在俯瞰下方的宽广海滩，所在的地方则是一堵白垩巨崖的顶端，四年之前，冯·博克把自己的家安在了这里，如同一只离群孤栖的老鹰。两个人把脑袋凑在一起，正在窃窃私语。他俩都在吸雪茄，若是你从下方往上看，两个红光闪烁的雪茄烟头就像是一双烟焰缭绕的恶魔之眼，正在透过黑暗俯视着你。","It was nine o’clock at night upon the second of August—the most terrible August in the history of the world. One might have thought already that God’s curse hung heavy over a degenerate world, for there was an awesome hush and a feeling of vague expectation in the sultry and stagnant air. The sun had long set, but one bloodred gash like an open wound lay low in the distant west. Above, the stars were shining brightly, and below, the lights of the shipping glimmered in the bay. The two famous Germans stood beside the stone parapet of the garden walk, with the long, low, heavily gabled house behind them, and they looked down upon the broad sweep of the beach at the foot of the great chalk cliff on which Von Bork, like some wandering eagle, had perched himself four years before. They stood with their heads close together, talking in low, confidential tones. From below the two glowing ends of their cigars might have been the smouldering eyes of some malignant fiend looking down in the darkness."
"这个冯·博克非同小可，堪称是德国皇帝麾下所有忠诚间谍之中最出色的人物。他的才干让他获得了最重要的一项谍报任务，也就是前来英国刺探情报，不但如此，在那些真正了解内情的人看来，自从他接受这项任务之后，他的才干更有了越来越突出的体现。世上只有六个人洞悉内情，其中之一就是他眼下的同伴、德国公使馆首席秘书冯·赫林男爵。此时此刻，男爵那辆形体巨大的一百马力奔驰轿车停在一旁，把那条乡间小路堵了个严严实实，正等着把它的主人送回伦敦。","A remarkable man this Von Bork—a man who could hardly be matched among all the devoted agents of the Kaiser. It was his talents which had first recommended him for the English mission, the most important mission of all, but since he had taken it over those talents had become more and more manifest to the half-dozen people in the world who were really in touch with the truth. One of these was his present companion, Baron Von Herling, the chief secretary of the legation, whose huge 100-horse-power Benz car was blocking the country lane as it waited to waft its owner back to London."
"“根据我对形势的判断，十之八九，你本周就得回柏林去，”秘书说道，“回去之后，亲爱的冯·博克，我看你一定会为他们给你准备的礼遇感到惊奇。最高当局对你在英国的工作有些什么评价，我也是略有所闻的。”秘书是个大块头，又高又壮，主要的政治资本则是他那种慢条斯理、一本正经的说话方式。","“So far as I can judge the trend of events, you will probably be back in Berlin within the week,” the secretary was saying. “When you get there, my dear Von Bork, I think you will be surprised at the welcome you will receive. I happen to know what is thought in the highest quarters of your work in this country.” He was a huge man, the secretary, deep, broad, and tall, with a slow, heavy fashion of speech which had been his main asset in his political career."
"冯·博克笑了起来。","Von Bork laughed."
"“要骗他们并不难，”他如是说道，“比他们还要驯良单纯的民族，你连想都想不出来。”","“They are not very hard to deceive,” he remarked. “A more docile, simple folk could not be imagined.”"
"“我倒不这么觉得，”对方若有所思地说道，“他们有一些古怪的规矩，你必须得学会遵守。外乡人往往会着他们的道，就是因为他们这种表面上的单纯。乍一看，你会觉得他们温和之极。接下来，你却会突然撞上某种十分坚硬的东西，这时你才会恍然大悟，你已经触到了他们的底线，只能设法适应头破血流的现实。举例说吧，他们有一些坐井观天的岛民习俗，不遵守是绝对不行的。”","“I don’t know about that,” said the other thoughtfully. “They have strange limits and one must learn to observe them. It is that surface simplicity of theirs which makes a trap for the stranger. One’s first impression is that they are entirely soft. Then one comes suddenly upon something very hard, and you know that you have reached the limit and must adapt yourself to the fact. They have, for example, their insular conventions which simply *must* be observed.”"
"“您指的是‘举止得体’之类的东西吗？”冯·博克叹了一口气，似乎是在这些方面吃过不少苦头。","“Meaning, ‘good form’ and that sort of thing?” Von Bork sighed as one who had suffered much."
"“我指的是所有那些千奇百怪的英国式偏见。为了说明这一点，我打算拿我自己栽的一个大跟头来做例子——我并不害怕谈论自己栽的跟头，因为你非常了解我的工作，看得到我的成就。事情发生在我刚来英国的时候，一位内阁大臣请我去他的乡间别墅参加周末聚会，聚会期间的谈话随意得叫人吃惊。”","“Meaning British prejudice in all its queer manifestations. As an example I may quote one of my own worst blunders—I can afford to talk of my blunders, for you know my work well enough to be aware of my successes. It was on my first arrival. I was invited to a week-end gathering at the country house of a cabinet minister. The conversation was amazingly indiscreet.”"
"冯·博克点了点头。“我也去过那里，”他干巴巴地说了一句。","Von Bork nodded. “I’ve been there,” said he dryly."
"“没错。呃，聚会结束之后，我自然就把席间搜集到的情报整理成一份摘要，发给了柏林方面。不巧的是，我们那位可敬的总理在这些事情上有点儿毛手毛脚，不小心说漏了嘴，表明他知道聚会期间的谈话内容。当然喽，他的话直接把火引到了我的身上。你根本想象不到，那件事情对我造成了多么大的伤害。我可以跟你打包票，那一次，我们那些英国主人的态度一点儿都不温和。我花了两年的时间才摆脱那件事情的影响。你倒好，端着你这副运动员的姿态——”","“Exactly. Well, I naturally sent a résumé of the information to Berlin. Unfortunately our good chancellor is a little heavy-handed in these matters, and he transmitted a remark which showed that he was aware of what had been said. This, of course, took the trail straight up to me. You’ve no idea the harm that it did me. There was nothing soft about our British hosts on that occasion, I can assure you. I was two years living it down. Now you, with this sporting pose of yours—”"
"“不，不对，您不能把这叫做‘姿态’。姿态是装出来的，我这可是天性的流露。我生来就擅长运动，而且乐在其中。”","“No, no, don’t call it a pose. A pose is an artificial thing. This is quite natural. i am a born sportsman. i enjoy it.”"
"“是啊，这样一来，效果就更好啦。你跟他们赛艇，跟他们一起打猎、打马球，哪一项运动都不落在他们后面，你的四驾马车也在奥林匹亚[^2]夺得了大奖。我甚至听人说过，你居然跟那些年青的军官打起了拳击赛。结果呢？谁也不把你当回事，都觉得你是个‘运动行家’、‘德国人当中的君子’，还是个酗酒成性、夜夜笙歌、满城乱窜、没心没肺的小伙子。与此同时，你这座宁静的乡间别墅一直是英格兰半数破坏活动的中心，而你这个爱好运动的乡绅也一直是全欧洲最精明的秘密特工。天才啊，亲爱的冯·博克——真是天才！”","“Well, that makes it the more effective. You yacht against them, you hunt with them, you play polo, you match them in every game, your four-in-hand takes the prize at olympia. i have even heard that you go the length of boxing with the young officers. What is the result? nobody takes you seriously. You are a ‘good old sport,’ ‘quite a decent fellow for a German,’ a hard-drinking, night-club, knock-about-town, devil-may-care young fellow. And all the time this quiet country house of yours is the centre of half the mischief in England, and the sporting squire the most astute secret-service man in Europe. Genius, my dear Von Bork—genius!”"
"“您过奖了，男爵。不过，我确实可以说一句，我在英国的四年并不是一事无成。我还没领您参观过我那个小小的仓库呢，您愿意进屋待会儿吗？”","“You flatter me, Baron. But certainly i may claim that my four years in this country have not been unproductive. i’ve never shown you my little store. Would you mind stepping in for a moment?”"
"书房的门正对着露台。冯·博克推开房门，率先走进房间，“咔嗒”一声摁亮电灯，把身后的大块头秘书让了进去，然后就关上房门，把格子窗上的厚重帘帷拉得严严实实。他做好了所有这些预防措施，跟着又检查了一遍，这才把他那张鹰隼一般的黝黑脸庞转向了客人。","The door of the study opened straight on to the terrace. Von Bork pushed it back, and, leading the way, he clicked the switch of the electric light. He then closed the door behind the bulky form which followed him and carefully adjusted the heavy curtain over the latticed window. only when all these precautions had been taken and tested did he turn his sunburned aquiline face to his guest."
"“我的一部分文件已经不在这儿了，”他说道，“昨天，我妻子和家里的其他人一起去了弗卢辛[^3]，带走了不太重要的一些文件。当然喽，我必须要求使馆为剩下的这些文件提供保护。”","“Some of my papers have gone,” said he. “When my wife and the household left yesterday for Flushing they took the less important with them. I must, of course, claim the protection of the embassy for the others.”"
"“我们已经把你列入了随员名单，你和你的行李都不会遇上什么麻烦。当然，赶巧了的话，咱们兴许也不是非走不可。英国没准儿会让法国自生自灭，因为我们确切地知道，英法两国并没有签订什么有约束力的条约。”","“Your name has already been filed as one of the personal suite. There will be no difficulties for you or your baggage. of course, it is just possible that we may not have to go. England may leave France to her fate. We are sure that there is no binding treaty between them.”"
"“比利时也是这样吗？”","“And Belgium?”"
"“没错，比利时也是这样。 ”","“Yes, and Belgium, too.”"
"冯·博克摇了摇头。“我觉得这怎么也不可能。有一个明明白白的条约摆在那里，英国要是在这样的羞辱面前忍气吞声，那就永远也抬不起头啦[^4]。”","Von Bork shook his head. “I don’t see how that could be. There is a definite treaty there. She could never from such a humiliation.”"
"“她至少可以得到暂时的太平啊。 ”","“She would at least have peace for the moment.”"
"“可是，她的荣誉该怎么办呢？”","“But her honour?”"
"“得了吧，亲爱的先生，咱们生活在一个功利主义的时代，‘荣誉’却是个中世纪的字眼儿。除此之外，英国并没有做好打仗的准备。说起来都让人不敢相信，咱们收了五千万的战争特别税，谁都会觉得咱们的意图已经昭然若揭，就跟在《泰晤士报》的头版登了广告一样，即便如此，这里的人依然沉睡不醒。时不时地会有人提出问题，我的责任就是给他们一个满意的答复；时不时地还有人感到愤慨，我的责任就是平息他们的怨气。不过，我可以跟你打包票，就那些关键环节而言，什么军需储备啦、防御潜艇攻击的措施啦、制造烈性炸药的计划啦，英国什么准备也没有。既然如此，英国怎么可能参战呢，更何况，咱们还把她的内部搅成了一锅粥，弄出了爱尔兰内战、砸窗子的泼妇[^5]，还有天晓得的其他一些让她自顾不暇的事情。 ”","“Tut, my dear sir, we live in a utilitarian age. Honour is a medieval conception. Besides England is not ready. it is an inconceivable thing, but even our special war tax of fifty million, which one would think made our purpose as clear as if we had advertised it on the front page of the *Times*, has not roused these people from their slumbers. Here and there one hears a question. it is my business to find an answer. Here and there also there is an irritation. it is my business to soothe it. But i can assure you that so far as the essentials go—the storage of munitions, the preparation for submarine attack, the arrangements for making high explosives—nothing is prepared. How, then, can England come in, especially when we have stirred her up such a devil’s brew of irish civil war, window-breaking Furies, and God knows what to keep her thoughts at home.”"
"“她总得为自己的将来着想吧。”","“She must think of her future.”"
"“哦，那就是另一码事了。要我说，关于英国的将来，咱们已经有了非常明确的计划，还有啊，你提供的情报将会在其中发挥至关重要的作用。今天或者明天，早晚会轮到约翰·布尔先生[^6]的。如果他愿意今天打，咱们已经做好了充分的准备。如果他选择明天，咱们的准备还会更加充分。我倒是觉得，他们的上策是跟盟友并肩作战，不要等到必须独力支撑的时候，不过呢，这是他们自个儿的事情，用不着咱们操心。这个星期就是他们的转折关头。对了，刚才你不是在说你的那些文件嘛。”秘书窝在扶手椅上，悠然自得地吞云吐雾，光溜溜的大脑袋在灯光下闪闪发亮。","“Ah, that is another matter. i fancy that in the future we have our own very definite plans about England, and that your information will be very vital to us. it is to-day or to-morrow with Mr. John Bull. if he prefers to-day we are perfectly ready. if it is to-morrow we shall be more ready still. i should think they would be wiser to fight with allies than without them, but that is their own affair. This week is their week of destiny. But you were speaking of your papers.” He sat in the armchair with the light shining upon his broad bald head, while he puffed sedately at his cigar."
"这个宽敞的房间镶着橡木墙板，四壁都是书架，远端的角落里挂着一道帘子。拉开帘子之后，一个包有黄铜的大保险柜露了出来。冯·博克从自己的表链上取下一把小小的钥匙，在保险柜的锁上折腾了好一番工夫，跟着就一把拉开了厚重的柜门。","The large oak-panelled, book-lined room had a curtain hung in the further corner. When this was drawn it disclosed a large, brass-bound safe. Von Bork detached a small key from his watch chain, and after some considerable manipulation of the lock he swung open the heavy door."
"“瞧！”他喊了一声，站到一旁，冲秘书挥了挥手。","“look!” said he, standing clear, with a wave of his hand."
"灯光把保险柜的内部照得清清楚楚，使馆秘书全神贯注地凝视着柜子里的一排排满满当当的文件格子。每个格子都贴着标签，一眼望去，他看到了一长串诸如“浅滩”、“港口防御”、“飞机”、“爱尔兰”、“埃及”、“朴茨茅斯要塞”、“英吉利海峡”、“罗赛斯”[^7]之类的名称，此外还有几十个别的。所有的格子都塞满了文件和图纸。","The light shone vividly into the opened safe, and the secretary of the embassy gazed with an absorbed interest at the rows of stuffed pigeon-holes with which it was furnished. Each pigeon-hole had its label, and his eyes as he glanced along them read a long series of such titles as “Fords,” “Harbour-defences,” “Aeroplanes,” “ireland,” “Egypt,” “Portsmouth forts,” “The Channel,” “Rosythe,” and a score of others. Each compartment was bristling with papers and plans."
"“了不起！”秘书说道，跟着就放下雪茄，用他那双肥硕的手轻轻地鼓起掌来。","“Colossal!” said the secretary. Putting down his cigar he softly clapped his fat hands."
"“所有这些都是在四年的时间里收集来的，男爵。对于一名狂饮无度、成天跑马的乡绅来说，这也算不赖了吧。不过，我最精美的那件藏品还在路上呢，这不，位置我都给它留好啦。”说的这里，他指了指标着“海军密码”的那个格子。","“And all in four years, Baron. not such a bad show for the hard-drinking, hard-riding country squire. But the gem of my collection is coming and there is the setting all ready for it.” He pointed to a space over which “naval Signals” was printed."
"“可是，你那个格子里的档案已经很丰富了啊。 ”","“But you have a good dossier there already.”"
"“全都是些过时的废纸。英国的海军部莫名其妙地产生了警觉，把所有的密码都给换了。这可是一次沉重的打击，男爵，是我整场战役当中最惨的一个败仗。不过，多亏了我的支票簿，还有能干的阿尔塔芒，所有问题都可以在今天晚上得到补救。”","“out of date and waste paper. The Admiralty in some way got the alarm and every code has been changed. it was a blow, Baron—the worst setback in my whole campaign. But thanks to my check-book and the good Altamont all will be well to-night.”"
"男爵看了看表，从喉咙里发出了一声失望的惊呼。","The Baron looked at his watch and gave a guttural exclamation of disappointment."
"“呃，我真的不能再等啦。你应该明白，此时此刻，卡尔顿巷[^8]那边事情很多，我们都得各就各位。我本来还打算把你取得巨大成功的消息带回去呢。阿尔塔芒没说什么时候来吗？”","“Well, i really can wait no longer. You can imagine that things are moving at present in Carlton Terrace and that we have all to be at our posts. i had hoped to be able to bring news of your great coup. Did Altamont name no hour?”"
"冯·博克把一封电报推到了男爵面前。","Von Bork pushed over a telegram."
"> 今晚必携新火花塞前来。","> Will come without fail to-night and bring new sparking plugs."
"> 阿尔塔芒","> ALTAMONT."
"“火花塞，嗯？”","“Sparking plugs, eh?”"
"“您知道吗，他假扮成了一名汽车专家，而我的车库里停满了汽车。按照我俩约定的暗号，有可能到手的所有资料都用汽车配件来命名。如果他说‘水箱’，指的就是战列舰，‘油泵’则是巡洋舰，如此等等。‘火花塞’就是海军密码。”","“You see he poses as a motor expert and i keep a full garage. in our code everything likely to come up is named after some spare part. if he talks of a radiator it is a battleship, of an oil pump a cruiser, and so on. Sparking plugs are naval signals.”"
"“电报是今天中午从朴茨茅斯发来的，”秘书一边察看电报的抬头，一边说道，“对了，你给他的报酬是什么呢？”","“From Portsmouth at midday,” said the secretary, examining the superscription. “By the way, what do you give him?”"
"“这件活计的报酬是五百镑。当然喽，他还有日常的薪水。”","“Five hundred pounds for this particular job. Of course he has a salary as well.”"
"“真是个贪心不足的无赖。他们这样的叛徒确实有用，可我还是不甘心让他们挣这种脏钱。”","“The greedy rogue. They are useful, these traitors, but I grudge them their blood money.”"
"“如果是阿尔塔芒，给多少我都甘心。他是个非常出色的特工。用他自个儿的话来说，我给他的价钱固然高，终归也从他那里拿到了东西。还有啊，他并不是什么叛徒。我敢跟您打包票，说到对英国的态度，跟那些满心仇怨的爱尔兰裔美国人比起来，咱们那些最激烈的大日耳曼主义容克[^9]也不过是温顺的乳鸽而已。”","“I grudge Altamont nothing. He is a wonderful worker. if i pay him well, at least he delivers the goods, to use his own phrase. Besides he is not a traitor. i assure you that our most pan-Germanic Junker is a sucking dove in his feelings towards England as compared with a real bitter irish-American.”"
"“哦，他是个爱尔兰裔美国人吗？”","“Oh, an irish-American?”"
"“听听他的口音，您就不会再有什么疑问。说实在的，有时候我简直听不懂他在说什么。看样子，他不光是跟英国的国王过不去，还跟国王陛下的英语[^10]过不去。您一定要走吗？他随时都会到这里来的。 ”","“If you heard him talk you would not doubt it. Sometimes i assure you I can hardly understand him. He seems to have declared war on the King’s English as well as on the English king. Must you really go? He may be here any moment.”"
"“不行。很抱歉，可我已经耽搁得太久啦。明天你早点儿来吧，一旦你把密码本带进约克公爵台阶旁边的那道小门[^11]，就算是为你在英国的工作画上了一个圆满的句号。什么！你还准备了托考依葡萄酒[^12]！”他指了指立在托盘里的一个积满尘土的酒瓶，瓶子封得严严实实，旁边还放着两只高脚酒杯。","“No. I’m sorry, but i have already overstayed my time. We shall expect you early to-morrow, and when you get that signal book through the little door on the Duke of York’s steps you can put a triumphant finis to your record in England. What! Tokay!” he indicated a heavily sealed dust-covered bottle which stood with two high glasses upon a salver."
"“您愿意喝一杯再走吗？”","“May i offer you a glass before your journey?”"
"“不了，谢谢。看样子，你们两个还打算痛饮一顿哩。”","“No, thanks. But it looks like revelry.”"
"“阿尔塔芒喝酒的口味很刁，而且看上了我的托考依葡萄酒。他这个家伙非常敏感，你必须在小事情上面将就他一下。说真的，研究他可是我的必修课哩。”说话间，他俩已经再次走上露台，正在顺着露台往外走。等在露台远端的司机轻轻一碰，男爵那辆庞大的轿车立刻震颤起来，发出了隆隆的轰鸣声。“依我看，那一定是哈里奇[^13]的灯火，”秘书一边说，一边穿上了风衣。“一切都是多么的平静、多么的安宁啊。本周之内，那里兴许就会有一些其他的火光，英国的海岸也不会再像现在这么宁静啦！如果那个能干的齐柏林[^14]答应我们的事情都能实现的话，英国的天空多半也保不住眼下的太平。对了，那个人是谁？”","“Altamont has a nice taste in wines, and he took a fancy to my Tokay. He is a touchy fellow and needs humouring in small things. i have to study him, i assure you.” They had strolled out on to the terrace again, and along it to the further end where at a touch from the Baron’s chauffeur the great car shivered and chuckled. “Those are the lights of Harwich, I suppose,” said the secretary, pulling on his dust coat. “How still and peaceful it all seems. There may be other lights within the week, and the English coast a less tranquil place! The heavens, too, may not be quite so peaceful if all that the good Zeppelin promises us comes true. By the way, who is that?”"
"他俩的身后只有一扇窗子还透着亮光，窗子里面点着一盏油灯，油灯侧畔的桌子旁边坐着一位可亲可敬、面色红润的老太太，戴着一顶乡村便帽。她正在埋头编织东西，还时不时地停下活计，伸手去抚摸身边小凳上的一只大黑猫。","Only one window showed a light behind them; in it there stood a lamp, and beside it, seated at a table, was a dear old ruddy-faced woman in a country cap. She was bending over her knitting and stopping occasionally to stroke a large black cat upon a stool beside her."
"“那是玛莎，我就留了这么一个仆人。”","“That is Martha, the only servant i have left.”"
"秘书吃吃地笑了起来。","The secretary chuckled."
"“她简直就是不列颠妮亚[^15]的化身哩，”他说道，“满脑子都是自个儿的事情，悠闲自在、昏昏欲睡。好了，再见，冯·博克！”他挥手作别，钻进轿车，转眼之间，轿车头灯射出的两束金光已经穿透了前方的黑暗。秘书仰在豪华座驾的靠垫上，全神贯注地思考着即将到来的欧洲战祸，因此就没有留意到，自己的轿车顺着村中街道曲折行进的时候，差一点儿就撞上了迎面驶来的一辆小小的福特轿车。","“She might almost personify Britannia,” said he, “with her complete self-absorption and general air of comfortable somnolence. Well, *au revoir*, Von Bork!” With a final wave of his hand he sprang into the car, and a moment later the two golden cones from the headlights shot forward through the darkness. The secretary lay back in the cushions of the luxurious limousine, with his thoughts so full of the impending European tragedy that he hardly observed that as his car swung round the village street it nearly passed over a little Ford coming in the opposite direction."
"轿车灯光消失在远方之后，冯·博克慢慢地走回书房。路过老管家那个窗口的时候，他发现她已经灭灯回房。他的家人和仆人为数众多，房子也很大，眼下的寂静和黑暗让他觉得有点儿不适应。不过，他的家人都到了安全的地方，房子里剩下的只有之前在厨房里磨蹭的那个老妇人，想到这些，他又觉得很是欣慰。书房里还有许多东西需要收拾，于是他动起手来，焚烧文件的火焰把他那张机敏的英俊脸庞烘得通红。接下来，他开始有条不紊地把保险柜里的宝贝往桌子旁边的一只皮箱里装。正在这时，他那双灵敏的耳朵听到了一辆轿车从远处驶来的声音，于是他欢呼一声，扣上皮箱，锁好保险柜，急匆匆地走上露台，刚好看到一辆开着车灯的小型轿车在大门旁边停了下来。乘客钻出轿车，快步走了过来，司机已经上了点年纪，身形壮硕、髭须斑白，此时依然气定神闲地坐在车里，看样子是做好了长久等候的准备。","Von Bork walked slowly back to the study when the last gleams of the motor lamps had faded into the distance. As he passed he observed that his old housekeeper had put out her lamp and retired. it was a new experience to him, the silence and darkness of his widespread house for his family and household had been a large one. it was a relief to him, however, to think that they were all in safety and that, but for that one old woman who had lingered in the kitchen, he had the whole place to himself. There was a good deal of tidying up to do inside his study and he set himself to do it until his keen, handsome face was flushed with the heat of the burning papers. A leather valise stood beside his table, and into this he began to pack very neatly and systematically the precious contents of his safe. He had hardly got started with the work, however, when his quick ears caught the sound of a distant car. instantly he gave an exclamation of satisfaction, strapped up the valise, shut the safe, locked it, and hurried out on to the terrace. He was just in time to see the lights of a small car come to a halt at the gate. A passenger sprang out of it and advanced swiftly towards him, while the chauffeur, a heavily built, elderly man with a gray moustache, settled down like one who resigns himself to a long vigil."
"“怎么样？”冯·博克一边跑上去迎接客人，一边急不可耐地问了一声。","“Well?” asked Von Bork eagerly, running forward to meet his visitor."
"来人没有回答，只是把一个小小的牛皮纸包裹举过头顶，得意洋洋地晃了晃。","For answer the man waved a small brown-paper parcel triumphantly above his head."
"“今天晚上，你真应该鼓掌欢迎我才是，先生，”来人高声嚷道。“东西总算是到手啦。”","“You can give me the glad hand to-night, mister,” he cried. “I’m bringing home the bacon at last.”"
"“你说的是密码吗？”","“The signals?”"
"“跟我在电报里说的一样，旗语、灯光信号、无线电密码，一分一毫都不少。我得提醒你一句，我拿来的只是副本，并不是原件，拿原件太危险啦。不过，货是真的，这你只管放心。”他粗鲁地拍了拍德国人的肩膀，德国人一闪身，没有理会他这种亲热的表示。","“Same as i said in my cable. Every last one of them, semaphore, lamp code, Marconi—a copy, mind you, not the original. That was too dangerous. But it’s the real goods, and you can lay to that.” He slapped the German upon the shoulder with a rough familiarity from which the other winced."
"“进来吧，”德国人说道，“屋里只剩我一个人了，等的就是这样东西。当然喽，副本比原件还要好。原件丢了的话，他们肯定会换掉所有的密码。你确定这份副本不会留下后患吗？”","“Come in,” he said. “i’m all alone in the house. i was only waiting for this. of course a copy is better than the original. if an original were missing they would change the whole thing. You think it’s all safe about the copy?”"
"爱尔兰裔美国人已经走进书房，摊开细长的四肢坐在了扶手椅上。他年已六旬，又高又瘦，轮廓分明，蓄着一小撮山羊胡子，整个儿的模样有点儿像漫画里的山姆大叔。一支抽了一半的雪茄耷拉在他的嘴角，已经被唾沫给浸湿了。坐下之后，他划燃一根火柴，重新点上了雪茄。“收拾东西准备走啦？”他一边四处张望，一边问道。“我说，先生，”看到露在帘子外面的保险柜之后，他补了一句，“你该不会告诉我，你就用那个东西来装你的文件吧？”","The irish-American had entered the study and stretched his long limbs from the armchair. He was a tall, gaunt man of sixty, with clear-cut features and a small goatee beard which gave him a general resemblance to the caricatures of uncle Sam. A half-smoked, sodden cigar hung from the corner of his mouth, and as he sat down he struck a match and relit it. “Making ready for a move?” he remarked as he looked round him. “Say, mister,” he added, as his eyes fell upon the safe from which the curtain was now removed, “you don’t tell me you keep your papers in that?”"
"“有什么问题吗？”","“Why not?”"
"“老天爷，文件就装在那么个没遮没挡的破玩意儿里面！亏你还号称是个间谍呢。可不是吗，只需要一把开罐头的小刀，美国的扒手就可以把它撬开。要是早知道你会把我的信大大咧咧地扔进那么一个玩意儿的话，傻子才给你写信呢。”","“Gosh, in a wide-open contraption like that! And they reckon you to be some spy. Why, a Yankee crook would be into that with a can-opener. If I’d known that any letter of mine was goin’ to lie loose in a thing like that i’d have been a mug to write to you at all.”"
"“什么样的扒手也撬不开那个保险柜，”冯 ·博克回答道，“你用什么工具都割不开那种金属。”","“It would puzzle any crook to force that safe,” Von Bork answered. “You won’t cut that metal with any tool.”"
"“锁呢？”","“But the lock?”"
"“开不了，锁的密码是双重的。你知道什么叫‘双重’吗？”","“No, it’s a double combination lock. You know what that is?”"
"“没听说过，”美国人说道。","“Search me,” said the American."
"“呃，意思就是你得知道一个单词加一组数字才能开锁。”他站起身来，指了指锁孔周围的双圈转盘。“外面的一圈儿是用来拨字母的，里面的一圈儿则是数字。”","“Well, you need a word as well as a set of figures before you can get the lock to work.” He rose and showed a double-radiating disc round the keyhole. “This outer one is for the letters, the inner one for the figures.”"
"“好吧，好吧，这么说也还不错。”","“Well, well, that’s fine.”"
"“瞧见了吧，它并不像你想的那么简单。保险柜是我四年前找人做的，我选的密码是哪个单词加哪组数字，你能猜得出来吗？”","“So it’s not quite as simple as you thought. it was four years ago that I had it made, and what do you think i chose for the word and figures?”"
"“这我可猜不出来。”","“it’s beyond me.”"
"“呃，我选的单词是‘ august’（八月），数字是‘ 1914’，合起来刚好就是眼下的这个时间。”","“Well, I chose August for the word, and 1914 for the figures, and here we are.”"
"美国人的脸上露出了既惊且佩的表情。","The American’s face showed his surprise and admiration."
"“我的天，这可真是妙极啦！你选的密码确实挺艺术的。”","“My, but that was smart! You had it down to a fine thing.”"
"“是啊，即便是在四年之前，我们那边的一些人也猜得出动手的日子。日子已经到了，明天早上，我这里也要关门大吉啦。”","“Yes, a few of us even then could have guessed the date. Here it is, and I’m shutting down to-morrow morning.”"
"“呃，要我说，你还得把我的事情安排好才行。我可不打算孤零零地待在这个该死的国家里。照我的估计，最多不过一个星期，约翰·布尔先生就该暴跳如雷啦。我还是隔岸观火比较安全。”","“Well, I guess you’ll have to fix me up also. i’m not staying in this gol-darned country all on my lonesome. in a week or less, from what I see, John Bull will be on his hind legs and fair ramping. I’d rather watch him from over the water.”"
"“你可是美国公民啊，有什么关系呢？”","“But you’re an American citizen?”"
"“咳，杰克·詹姆斯也是美国公民，还不是照样在波特兰[^16]蹲班房。遇上了英国的警察，说你是美国公民也不管用。他会跟你说，‘这里是英国法纪的管辖范围。’对了，先生，说到杰克·詹姆斯，我觉得你可没怎么替你的人打掩护啊。”","“Well, so was Jack James an American citizen, but he’s doing time in Portland all the same. it cuts no ice with a British copper to tell him you’re an American citizen. ‘it’s British law and order over here,’ says he. By the way, mister, talking of Jack James, it seems to me you don’t do much to cover your men.”"
"“这话是什么意思？”冯·博克厉声问道。","“What do you mean?” Von Bork asked sharply."
"“呃，你是他们的东家，对吧？不让他们栽跟头是你的责任。可是，他们确确实实栽了跟头，什么时候见你拉过他们一把呢？栽跟头的有詹姆斯——”","“Well, you are their employer, ain’t you? it’s up to you to see that they don’t fall down. But they do fall down, and when did you ever pick them up? There’s James——”"
"“那只能怪詹姆斯自己，这一点你自个儿也明白。他太爱自作主张，干不了这种活计。”","“It was James’s own fault. You know that yourself. He was too self-willed for the job.”"
"“詹姆斯确实是个笨蛋——这我倒可以打包票。接下来还有霍利斯。”","“James was a bonehead—i give you that. Then there was Hollis.”"
"“那家伙是个疯子。”","“The man was mad.”"
"“呃，快栽跟头的时候，他确实有点儿稀里糊涂。从早到晚都得跟上百个随时可能告发自己的人混在一起，想不发疯也不行啊。可是，还有斯坦纳——”","“Well, he went a bit woozy towards the end. it’s enough to make a man bughouse when he has to play a part from morning to night with a hundred guys all ready to set the coppers wise to him. But now there is Steiner——”"
"冯·博克猛一激灵，红彤彤的脸庞稍稍有点儿发白。","Von Bork started violently, and his ruddy face turned a shade paler."
"“斯坦纳怎么啦？”","“What about Steiner?”"
"“呃，没怎么，他们把他给逮住啦。昨天晚上，他们突袭了他的铺子，把他和他的文件一块儿送进了朴茨茅斯监狱。你倒是一走了之，他这个倒霉蛋却不得不承担后果，能捡条命就算不错啦。所以啊，你走了之后，我也要赶紧跑到海峡对面去。”","“Well, they’ve got him, that’s all. They raided his store last night, and he and his papers are all in Portsmouth jail. You’ll go off and he, poor devil, will have to stand the racket, and lucky if he gets off with his life. That’s why i want to get over the water as soon as you do.”"
"冯·博克是个意志坚强、深沉内敛的人，这个消息却让他受到了显而易见的震撼。","Von Bork was a strong, self-contained man, but it was easy to see that the news had shaken him."
"“他们怎么能查到斯坦纳呢？”他喃喃自语。“这可是迄今为止最大的打击了。”","“How could they have got on to Steiner?” he muttered. “That’s the worst blow yet.”"
"“咳，差一点儿还有更大的呢，按我看，他们就快查到我头上了。 ”","“Well, you nearly had a worse one, for i believe they are not far off me.”"
"“不会吧！”","“You don’t mean that!”"
"“不会才怪。我在弗拉顿[^17]那边的房东太太受到了警察的盘问，听说这件事情之后，我就知道自个儿的动作得快点儿啦。可是，先生，我倒想问一问，警察是怎么知道这些事情的呢？从我开始帮你做事的时候算起，到斯坦纳失手为止，你已经折了五个人，而我也知道，我要不赶紧跑的话，第六个会是谁。这事情你打算怎么解释呢，看着你的人这么纷纷倒下，你不觉得丢脸吗？”","“Sure thing. My landlady down Fratton way had some inquiries, and when I heard of it I guessed it was time for me to hustle. But what I want to know, mister, is how the coppers know these things? Steiner is the fifth man you’ve lost since i signed on with you, and i know the name of the sixth if i don’t get a move on. How do you explain it, and ain’t you ashamed to see your men go down like this?”"
"冯·博克的脸涨得通红。","Von Bork flushed crimson."
"“你哪来的胆子，怎么敢说这种话！”","“How dare you speak in such a way!”"
"“我要是没有胆子，也就不会帮你做事啦。不过，我这就跟你实打实地讲讲心里话吧。我听人家说，一旦一名情报员完成了自己的任务，你们那些德国政客是不怕过河拆桥的。”","“If I didn’t dare things, mister, i wouldn’t be in your service. But I’ll tell you straight what is in my mind. I’ve heard that with you German politicians when an agent has done his work you are not sorry to see him put away.”"
"冯·博克跳了起来。","Von Bork sprang to his feet."
"“你居然敢说我出卖自己的情报员！”","“Do you dare to suggest that i have given away my own agents!”"
"“我倒不是这个意思，先生，不过呢，某个地方肯定有一只囮子，或者是一个骗局，具体是什么地方，得靠你自己去查清楚。不管怎么样，我是不想再玩儿命啦。我打算去那个巴掌大的荷兰[^17]，越快越好。”","“I don’t stand for that, mister, but there’s a stool pigeon or a cross somewhere, and it’s up to you to find out where it is. Anyhow I am taking no more chances. it’s me for little Holland, and the sooner the better.”"
"冯·博克压住了自己的怒火。","Von Bork had mastered his anger."
"“咱们做了这么久的盟友，怎么也不能在这个胜利的时刻伤和气，”他说道，“你干得非常漂亮，冒的风险也不少，这些我是不会忘记的。你当然可以去荷兰，还可以从鹿特丹坐船去纽约。一周之后，其他的航线就都不安全了。把那个本子给我，我好把它跟其他东西一起打包。”","“We have been allies too long to quarrel now at the very hour of victory,” he said. “You’ve done splendid work and taken risks, and I can’t forget it. By all means go to Holland, and you can get a boat from Rotterdam to new York. no other line will be safe a week from now. I’ll take that book and pack it with the rest.”"
"美国人把纸包拿在手里，并没有交出去的意思。","The American held the small parcel in his hand, but made no motion to give it up."
"“银子呢？”他问道。","“What about the dough?” he asked."
"“什么？”","“The what?”"
"“我说的就是油水，就是赏金，就是那五百镑。临到最后关头，那个炮手的态度下流得要命，我额外加了一百块才把他摆平，不然的话，你跟我都得玩儿完。他跟我说什么‘给多少也不成！’而且是来真的，不过，加了一百块之后，事情还是成了。这东西前前后后花了我两百镑，所以呢，我那份儿不到手的话，我是不会把它交出去的。”","“The boodle. The reward. The £500. The gunner turned damned nasty at the last, and i had to square him with an extra hundred dollars or it would have been nitsky for you and me. ‘nothin’ doin’!’ says he, and he meant it, too, but the last hundred did it. it’s cost me two hundred pound from first to last, so it isn’t likely i’d give it up without gettin’ my wad.”"
"冯·博克不无苦涩地笑了笑。“看样子，你对我的信用评价不高啊，”他说道，“非得见到我的钱才肯给本子。”","Von Bork smiled with some bitterness. “You don’t seem to have a very high opinion of my honour,” said he, “you want the money before you give up the book.”"
"“咳，先生，生意就是生意嘛。”","“Well, mister, it is a business proposition.”"
"“好吧，就按你说的办。”他坐到桌边，写好一张支票，把支票从支票簿上扯了下来，但却没有交给美国人。“说来说去，阿尔塔芒先生，咱们用的既然是生意上的规矩，”他说道，“你信任我几分，我也只能信任你几分。听明白了吗？”他补了一句，回头看着美国人。“支票就摆在桌子上。你把钱拿走之前，我要求验一验你的包裹。”","“All right. Have your way.” He sat down at the table and scribbled a check, which he tore from the book, but he refrained from handing it to his companion. “After all, since we are to be on such terms, Mr. Altamont,” said he, “i don’t see why i should trust you any more than you trust me. Do you understand?” he added, looking back over his shoulder at the American. “There’s the check upon the table. i claim the right to examine that parcel before you pick the money up.”"
"美国人二话不说，直接把纸包递了过去。冯·博克解开一圈儿绳子，又拆掉两层包装纸，跟着就看到一本蓝色的小册子，一下子目瞪口呆地愣在了那里。小册子的封皮上印着一行金字：养蜂实用手册。谍报大师直勾勾地盯着这个离题万里的书名，愣神也不过是一瞬间的事情。下一个瞬间，一只铁钳似的手已经抓住了他的后颈，一块浸过氯仿的海绵也已经捂住了他扭曲变形的脸。","The American passed it over without a word. Von Bork undid a winding of string and two wrappers of paper. Then he sat gazing for a moment in silent amazement at a small blue book which lay before him. Across the cover was printed in golden letters *Practical Handbook of Bee Culture*. only for one instant did the master spy glare at this strangely irrelevant inscription. The next he was gripped at the back of his neck by a grasp of iron, and a chloroformed sponge was held in front of his writhing face."
"“再来一杯，华生！”歇洛克·福尔摩斯先生一边说[^19]，一边把那瓶帝国托考依葡萄酒[^20]伸了过去。","“Another glass, Watson!” said Mr. Sherlock Holmes as he extended the bottle of imperial Tokay."
"车里那个身形壮硕的司机已经坐在了桌子旁边，这会儿便迫不及待地递上了自己的杯子。","The thickset chauffeur, who had seated himself by the table, pushed forward his glass with some eagerness."
"“好酒啊，福尔摩斯。”","“it is a good wine, Holmes.”"
"“还不是一般的好酒哩，华生。躺在沙发上的这位朋友信誓旦旦地告诉我，这瓶酒来自弗朗茨·约瑟夫的美泉宫酒窖[^21]。麻烦你把窗子打开，挥发的氯仿可增加不了美酒的风味。 ”","“A remarkable wine, Watson. our friend upon the sofa has assured me that it is from Franz Josef ’s special cellar at the Schoenbrunn Palace. Might i trouble you to open the window, for chloroform vapour does not help the palate.”"
"福尔摩斯站在柜门半开的保险柜跟前，把柜子里的卷宗一个一个地往外拿，先是飞快地检查一遍，再把它们整整齐齐地码进冯·博克的那个皮箱。德国人躺在沙发上，鼾声如雷，一根皮带缚住了他的双臂，另一根缚住了他的双腿。","The safe was ajar, and Holmes standing in front of it was removing dossier after dossier, swiftly examining each, and then packing it neatly in Von Bork’s valise. The German lay upon the sofa sleeping stertorously with a strap round his upper arms and another round his legs."
"“咱们不用着急，华生。没人会来打搅咱们。你摁一下唤人铃，好吗？这屋里没有别人，只有老玛莎，她的表现棒极啦。刚刚接到这项任务，我就把她安插到了这里。噢，玛莎，告诉你一个好消息，一切都很顺利。”","“We need not hurry ourselves, Watson. We are safe from interruption. Would you mind touching the bell? There is no one in the house except old Martha, who has played her part to admiration. i got her the situation here when first i took the matter up. Ah, Martha, you will be glad to hear that all is well.”"
"喜气洋洋的老夫人已经出现在了门口，这会儿便微笑着冲福尔摩斯先生深施一礼，跟着又不无忧虑地瞥了一眼沙发上的人。","The pleasant old lady had appeared in the doorway. She curtseyed with a smile to Mr. Holmes, but glanced with some apprehension at the figure upon the sofa."
"“没事的，玛莎。他一点儿事儿也没有。”","“It is all right, Martha. He has not been hurt at all.”"
"“那就好，福尔摩斯先生。按他自个儿的标准看，他也算是个好东家。昨天他还打算让我跟他妻子一起去德国哩，可是，那样就跟您的计划对不上了，对吧，先生？”","“I’m glad of that, Mr. Holmes. According to his lights he has been a kind master. He wanted me to go with his wife to Germany yesterday, but that would hardly have suited your plans, would it, sir?”"
"“确实对不上，玛莎。你不在这儿，我怎么能放心呢。今天晚上，我们等了好一会儿才等到你的信号。”","“No, indeed, Martha. So long as you were here i was easy in my mind. We waited some time for your signal to-night.”"
"“因为那个秘书在这儿，先生。”","“It was the secretary, sir.”"
"“我知道，路上我们碰见了他的车。”","“I know. His car passed ours.”"
"“我还以为他打算赖着不走呢，而且我知道，他要是在这儿的话，也跟您的计划对不上。”","“I thought he would never go. i knew that it would not suit your plans, sir, to find him here.”"
"“确实对不上。还好，只等了半个钟头，我们就看到你的灯灭了，由此知道障碍已经扫清。你明天再向我汇报吧，玛莎，到伦敦的克拉里奇酒店[^22]去找我。 ”","“No, indeed. Well, it only meant that we waited half an hour or so until I saw your lamp go out and knew that the coast was clear. You can report to me to-morrow in london, Martha, at Claridge’s Hotel.”"
"“好的，先生。”","“Very good, sir.”"
"“你已经收拾好了吧。”","“I suppose you have everything ready to leave.”"
"“是的，先生。今天他发了七封信，我照常把收信人的地址记了下来。”","“Yes, sir. He posted seven letters to-day. i have the addresses as usual.”"
"“好极了，玛莎，明天我再看吧。晚安。这些文件，”老夫人离开之后，他接着说道，“都没有什么特别大的价值，原因嘛，可想而知，他早就已经把文件里的情报交给了德国政府。这些都是情报的原件，往国外送是不安全的。”","“Very good, Martha. i will look into them to-morrow. Good-night. These papers,” he continued as the old lady vanished, “are not of very great importance, for, of course, the information which they represent has been sent off long ago to the German government. These are the originals which could not safely be got out of the country.”"
"“照你这么说，这些文件都只是废纸而已。”","“Then they are of no use.”"
"“我倒不会说得这么绝对，华生。它们至少可以告诉咱们，哪些事情他们知道，哪些又不知道。告诉你吧，很多文件都是我给他的，不用我说，你也知道它们完全靠不住。要是能看到一艘德国巡洋舰按照我提供的雷区海图驶入索伦特海峡[^23]，一定会让我的暮年增辉添彩。还有你，华生”——他停下手头的工作，抓住了老友的双肩——“我还没在灯光之下好好地瞧瞧你呢。这些年你过得怎么样啊？看样子，你还是当初那个轻松快活的小伙计嘛。”","“I should not go so far as to say that, Watson. They will at least show our people what is known and what is not. i may say that a good many of these papers have come through me, and i need not add are thoroughly untrustworthy. it would brighten my declining years to see a German cruiser navigating the Solent according to the mine-field plans which I have furnished. But you, Watson”—he stopped his work and took his old friend by the shoulders—“I’ve hardly seen you in the light yet. How have the years used you? You look the same blithe boy as ever.”"
"“我觉得自己年轻了二十岁，福尔摩斯。你发电报让我开车到哈里奇去找你，我这辈子还很少像收到电报的时候那么高兴。说说你吧，福尔摩斯，你的样子也没怎么变，除了那一撮难看的山羊胡子之外。”","“I feel twenty years younger, Holmes. i have seldom felt so happy as when I got your wire asking me to meet you at Harwich with the car. But you, Holmes- you have changed very little- save for that horrible goatee.”"
"“为了自己的祖国，这样的牺牲在所难免，华生，”福尔摩斯一边说，一边捋了捋自己的小山羊胡子。“等到明天，山羊胡子就只是一种不愉快的回忆啦。只需要理个发，再做一点儿皮面工夫，明天我肯定会焕然一新地出现在克拉里奇酒店，恢复我在这个美国花样——对不起，华生，我的英语辞源似乎已经遭受了永久性的污染——这个美国角色找上门来之前的模样。”","“These are the sacrifices one makes for one’s country, Watson,” said Holmes, pulling at his little tuft. “To-morrow it will be but a dreadful memory. With my hair cut and a few other superficial changes I shall no doubt reappear at Claridge’s to-morrow as i was before this American stunt—i beg your pardon, Watson, my well of English seems to be permanently defiled—before this American job came my way.”"
"“可你已经退休了啊，福尔摩斯。我们都听说你躲进了南部丘陵[^24]的一个小农庄，过起了与蜜蜂和书籍为伴的隐士生活。”","“But you have retired, Holmes. We heard of you as living the life of a hermit among your bees and your books in a small farm upon the South Downs.”"
"“一点儿不错，华生。这就是我悠闲岁月的硕果、我近些年里的力作！”他拿起桌上的那本小册子，念出了完整的书名：养蜂实用手册——兼论隔离蜂王的技巧。“书是我独力完成的。我拿出当初观察伦敦犯罪阶层的劲头，细细地观察那些辛勤劳作的小小族群，度过了一个个忙忙碌碌的白天、一个个苦思冥想的夜晚。瞧瞧吧，这就是我日夜辛劳换来的果实。”","“Exactly, Watson. Here is the fruit of my leisured ease, the *magnum opus* of my latter years!” He picked up the volume from the table and read out the whole title, *Practical Handbook of Bee Culture, with Some Observations upon the Segregation of the Queen*. “Alone i did it. Behold the fruit of pensive nights and laborious days when i watched the little working gangs as once i watched the criminal world of london.”"
"“可你怎么会重操旧业呢？”","“But how did you get to work again?”"
"“这个嘛，我自个儿也经常觉得奇怪哩。单是外交大臣的话，我还可以敷衍过去，可是，首相大人竟然也屈尊踏进了我的陋室——！是这样，华生，沙发上的这位先生是个独一无二的人物，好得让我国人民有点儿受不了。我们的事情出了不少岔子，谁也找不到出岔子的原因。政府盯上了一些间谍，甚至还抓了几个，种种迹象却表明，那些人的背后有一个强有力的隐秘主脑。政府无论如何也得把那个主脑挖出来，于是就强烈敦促我展开调查。调查工作花了我整整两年的时间，华生，过程倒也不能说是平淡乏味。我首先去了芝加哥，又在布法罗混进了爱尔兰人的一个秘密帮会，还给斯基伯林[^25]的警方添了很大的麻烦，这才让冯·博克手下的一名情报员觉得我是个合适的人选、把我推荐给了冯·博克。听了这些，你想必已经明白，这件事情确实是非常复杂。打那以后，冯·博克对我信任有加，令我倍感荣幸，可这并不能阻止他的大多数计划出现不易觉察的问题、不能阻止他那五个最能干的情报员锒铛入狱。我密切地观察着他们的长势，华生，成熟一个我就摘一个。呃，先生，你没事吧！”","“Ah, i have often marvelled at it myself. The Foreign Minister alone I could have withstood, but when the Premier also deigned to visit my humble roof——! The fact is, Watson, that this gentleman upon the sofa was a bit too good for our people. He was in a class by himself. Things were going wrong, and no one could understand why they were going wrong. Agents were suspected or even caught, but there was evidence of some strong and secret central force. it was absolutely necessary to expose it. Strong pressure was brought upon me to look into the matter. It has cost me two years, Watson, but they have not been devoid of excitement. When I say that i started my pilgrimage at Chicago, graduated in an irish secret society at Buffalo, gave serious trouble to the constabulary at Skibbareen, and so eventually caught the eye of a subordinate agent of Von Bork, who recommended me as a likely man, you will realise that the matter was complex. Since then i have been honoured by his confidence, which has not prevented most of his plans going subtly wrong and five of his best agents being in prison. I watched them, Watson, and I picked them as they ripened. Well, sir, I hope that you are none the worse!”"
"最后一句话是冲冯·博克说的，后者又是抽凉气又是眨眼睛地折腾了好一阵，之后就静静地躺在那里倾听福尔摩斯的长篇大论，眼下则突然发作，嘴里迸出一连串恶狠狠的德语谩骂，一张脸也气得变了形。福尔摩斯继续飞快地检查文件，任由他的俘虏在旁边咒骂不停。","The last remark was addressed to Von Bork himself, who after much gasping and blinking had lain quietly  listening to Holmes’s statement. He broke out now into a furious stream of German invective, his face convulsed with passion. Holmes continued his swift investigation of documents while his prisoner cursed and swore."
"“德语虽然没什么音乐性，但却是表达能力最强的一种语言，”冯·博克精疲力竭地住嘴之后，福尔摩斯如是品评。“嘿！嘿！”他补了一句，死死地盯着一张摹印图纸的边角看了一阵，然后才把图纸放进盒子。“这张图纸应该可以把另一只鸟儿送进笼子。虽然我早就盯上了这个主计官，可我真没想到，他竟然下流到这种程度。冯·博克先生，你可真是作恶多端。”","“Though unmusical, German is the most expressive of all languages,” he observed when Von Bork had stopped from pure exhaustion. “Hullo! Hullo!” he added as he looked hard at the corner of a tracing before putting it in the box. “This should put another bird in the cage. i had no idea that the paymaster was such a rascal, though i have long had an eye upon him. Mister Von Bork, you have a great deal to answer for.”"
"俘虏已经挣扎着从沙发上支起了身子，这会儿正直勾勾地盯着福尔摩斯，用的是一种混合着惊愕与仇恨的古怪眼神。","The prisoner had raised himself with some difficulty upon the sofa and was staring with a strange mixture of amazement and hatred at his captor."
"“我会从你身上找回来的，阿尔塔芒，”他一字一顿地说道，“哪怕得花一辈子的时间，我也要从你身上找回来！”","“I shall get level with you, Altamont,” he said, speaking with slow deliberation. “if it takes me all my life i shall get level with you!”"
"“老掉牙的情歌又来了，”福尔摩斯说道，“过去的日子里，我早就听腻了啊。这是不幸去世的莫里亚蒂教授最钟爱的小曲儿，塞巴斯蒂安·莫兰上校也喜欢哼哼两句[^26]，然而，时至今日，我不还是好端端地在南部丘陵养蜜蜂嘛。”","“The old sweet song,” said Holmes. “How often have i heard it in days gone by. it was a favourite ditty of the late lamented Professor Moriarty. Colonel Sebastian Moran has also been known to warble it. And yet i live and keep bees upon the South Downs.”"
"“不得好死，你这个双料叛徒！”德国人嚷道，使劲儿想挣开身上的绑缚，眼睛里燃着杀气腾腾的怒火。","“Curse you, you double traitor!” cried the German, straining against his bonds and glaring murder from his furious eyes."
"“不，不对，我没有你说的那么坏，”福尔摩斯笑着说道，“听了我刚才的话，你肯定已经明白，芝加哥的阿尔塔芒先生实际上是个子虚乌有的人物。我用过他一段时间，眼下他已经消失啦。”","“No, no, it is not so bad as that,” said Holmes, smiling. “As my speech surely shows you, Mr. Altamont of Chicago had no existence in fact. I used him and he is gone.”"
"“那你到底是谁？”","“Then who are you?”"
"“说真的，我是谁都无所谓，不过，冯·博克先生，既然你好像对这个问题有点儿兴趣，那我不妨告诉你，这并不是我第一次跟你们家的人打交道。我在德国经办过不少业务，你多半听说过我的名字。”","“It is really immaterial who i am, but since the matter seems to interest you, Mr. Von Bork, i may say that this is not my first acquaintance with the members of your family. I have done a good deal of business in Germany in the past and my name is probably familiar to you.”"
"“我倒是很想听一听，”普鲁士人恶狠狠地说道。","“I would wish to know it,” said the Prussian grimly."
"“是我让艾琳 ·阿德勒不再纠缠前波希米亚国王[^27]，那时你表兄海因里希正在担任帝国公使，也是我，让你母亲的兄长格拉芬斯坦伯爵逃脱了无政府主义分子克洛普曼的谋杀阴谋，还是我——”","“It was i who brought about the separation between irene Adler and the late King of Bohemia when your cousin Heinrich was the imperial Envoy. it was i also who saved from murder, by the nihilist Klopman, Count Von und Zu Grafenstein, who was your mother’s elder brother. It was I—”"
"冯·博克惊得坐了起来。","Von Bork sat up in amazement."
"“那你只可能是那个人，”他嚷了一声。","“There is only one man,” he cried."
"“没错，”福尔摩斯说道。","“Exactly,” said Holmes."
"冯·博克哀叹一声，倒回了沙发上。“可我的大多数情报都是从你那里来的，”他叫了起来，“那些东西能有什么价值呢？我的工作又算什么呢？我可算是彻底完蛋了！”","Von Bork groaned and sank back on the sofa. “And most of that information came through you,” he cried. “What is it worth? What have I done? it is my ruin forever!”"
"“那些东西确实有点儿靠不住，”福尔摩斯说道，“不核对一下是不行的，可你们已经没有核对的时间啦。你们的海军司令将会发现，跟他的预计相比，我们的新式火炮大了不少，巡洋舰的速度兴许也快了那么一点点。”","“It is certainly a little untrustworthy,” said Holmes. “it will require some checking and you have little time to check it. Your admiral may find the new guns rather larger than he expects, and the cruisers perhaps a trifle faster.”"
"冯·博克绝望地扼住了自己的咽喉。","Von Bork clutched at his own throat in despair."
"“毫无疑问，你们会在适当的时候发现，还有很多细节也不符合事实。不过，冯·博克先生，你拥有一个绝大多数德国人都没有的长处，那就是公平竞技的精神。你让那么多的人上了当，到最后，你自个儿也上了别人的当，认识到这一点，你想必不会对我怀恨在心。说到底，你为你的国家尽了力，我也为我的国家尽了力，这样的事情不是再正常不过了吗？还有啊，”他伸手拍了拍这个颓唐败将的肩膀，好声好气地补了一句，“这样总比栽在某个下作对头的手里要强吧。文件已经收拾好了，华生。麻烦你帮我把俘虏抬出去，咱们这就可以往伦敦进发了。”","“There are a good many other points of detail which will, no doubt, come to light in good time. But you have one quality which is very rare in a German, Mr. Von Bork: you are a sportsman and you will bear me no ill-will when you realise that you, who have outwitted so many other people, have at last been outwitted yourself. After all, you have done your best for your country, and i have done my best for mine, and what could be more natural? Besides,” he added, not unkindly, as he laid his hand upon the shoulder of the prostrate man, “it is better than to fall before some more ignoble foe. These papers are now ready, Watson. If you will help me with our prisoner, I think that we may get started for London at once.”"
"要把冯·博克抬出去可不是那么容易，因为他身强力壮，眼下又被逼到了绝境。到最后，两个朋友一人抓住他一只胳膊，推着他顺着那条花园小径往外走，速度缓慢之极。短短几个钟头之前，他还在同一条小径上豪情万丈地高视阔步、接受那位著名外交家的祝贺呢。经过一场短暂的最后格斗之后，两个朋友把手脚依然绑着皮带的冯·博克放在了那辆小型轿车的空座上，又把他那个宝贝箱子塞在了他的身旁。","It was no easy task to move Von Bork, for he was a strong and a desperate man. Finally, holding either arm, the too friends walked him very slowly down the garden walk which he had trod with such proud confidence when he received the congratulations of the famous diplomatist only a few hours before. After a short, final struggle he was hoisted, still bound hand and foot, into the spare seat of the little car. His precious valise was wedged in beside him."
"“依我看，按眼下的条件来说，这样已经是最舒服的啦，”安排停当之后，福尔摩斯说道，“我要是点支雪茄送到你嘴里的话，你不会觉得我太放肆吧？”","“I trust that you are as comfortable as circumstances permit,” said Holmes when the final arrangements were made. “Should i be guilty of a liberty if i lit a cigar and placed it between your lips?”"
"不过，什么样的照顾也安抚不了那个怒不可遏的德国人。","But all amenities were wasted upon the angry German."
"“我觉得你应该知道，歇洛克·福尔摩斯先生，”他说道，“如果你们的政府支持你这么干的话，那就是一种战争行为。”","“I suppose you realise, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” said he, “that if your government bears you out in this treatment it becomes an act of war.”"
"“你们政府的态度，还有你干的这些事情，又该怎么解释呢？”福尔摩斯说道，敲了敲那个箱子。","“What about your government and all this treatment?” said Holmes, tapping the valise."
"“你只能代表你自己，没有权力逮捕我，整件事情绝对是法理难容、令人发指。”","“You are a private individual. You have no warrant for my arrest. The whole proceeding is absolutely illegal and outrageous.”"
"“绝对是这样。”","“Absolutely,” said Holmes."
"“绑架德国公民。”","“Kidnapping a German subject.”"
"“并且盗窃他的私人文件。”","“And stealing his private papers.”"
"“嗬，你倒也明白你们干了些什么事情，你，还有你这个同伙。从村子里经过的时候，我要是高声呼救的话——”","“Well, you realise your position, you and your accomplice here. If I were to shout for help as we pass through the village—”"
"“亲爱的先生，你要是做出这等蠢事的话，多半就会给我国那些名字缺乏变化的乡村旅馆增添一个新的选择，让它们可以挂出一块招牌，‘吊着的普鲁士人’。英格兰人虽然很有耐性，眼下却有点儿着急上火，所以呢，你最好不要把他们逼得太狠。不行的，冯·博克先生，你还是放明白点儿，老老实实地跟我们去苏格兰场吧。到了那里之后，你可以跟你的朋友冯·赫林男爵联系，看看你是否依然可以得到他为你保留的那个使馆随员席位。至于你，华生，我听说你打算重操军医旧业，跟我们并肩战斗，这样看来，你去伦敦也是顺路。跟我一起在露台上待会儿吧，说不定，咱们再也没机会平平静静地交谈啦。”","“My dear sir, if you did anything so foolish you would probably enlarge the too limited titles of our village inns by giving us ‘The Dangling Prussian’ as a signpost. The Englishman is a patient creature, but at present his temper is a little inflamed, and it would be as well not to try him too far. no, Mr. Von Bork, you will go with us in a quiet, sensible fashion to Scotland Yard, whence you can send for your friend, Baron Von Herling, and see if even now you may not fill that place which he has reserved for you in the ambassadorial suite. As to you, Watson, you are joining us with your old service, as i understand, so London won’t be out of your way. Stand with me here upon the terrace, for it may be the last quiet talk that we shall ever have.”"
"两个朋友亲密地交谈了几分钟，光景宛如昨日，他们的俘虏则在车里扭来扭去，徒劳地想要挣开身上的绑缚。两个朋友转身走向轿车的时候，福尔摩斯回头指了指洒满月光的海面，若有所思地摇了摇头。","The two friends chatted in intimate converse for a few minutes, recalling once again the days of the past, while their prisoner vainly wriggled to undo the bonds that held him. As they turned to the car Holmes pointed back to the moonlit sea and shook a thoughtful head."
"“要刮东风啦，华生。”","“There’s an east wind coming, Watson.”"
"“我觉得不会，福尔摩斯。天气暖和得很啊。”","“I think not, Holmes. it is very warm.”"
"“华生老兄！这年月什么都在变，唯有你屹立依然。不管你觉得会不会，东风终归要来，而且是英格兰从来不曾见过的暴风。这阵风定然寒冷彻骨，华生，我们当中有许多人都会在风中枯萎凋谢。即便如此，这阵风依然是出自上帝的意愿，风暴平息之后，沐浴在阳光之下的将会是一片更加洁净、更加美好、更加坚实的土地。发动汽车吧，华生，咱们该上路了。我这儿有一张五百镑的支票，最好是早点儿兑现为妙，因为开支票的人多半干得出止付的事情，如果他办得到的话。”","“Good old Watson! You are the one fixed point in a changing age. There’s an east wind coming all the same, such a wind as never blew on England yet. it will be cold and bitter, Watson, and a good many of us may wither before its blast. But it’s God’s own wind none the less, and a cleaner, better, stronger land will lie in the sunshine when the storm has cleared. Start her up, Watson, for it’s time that we were on our way. i have a check for five hundred pounds which should be cashed early, for the drawer is quite capable of stopping it if he can.”"
