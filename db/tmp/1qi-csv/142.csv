"爱尔兰的“教派口号”","“Party Cries” In Ireland"
"作者：马克·吐温","by Mark Twain "
"贝尔法斯特地区宗教氛围相当浓厚。可以说整个爱尔兰北部地区都是这样。城中大约一半的居民是新教徒，另一半则是天主教徒。两个教派都竭力宣扬各自的教义，争取无宗教信仰居民的青睐。人们常能听到狂热教徒们的骇人事例。一周前，大批天主教徒聚集到阿尔马，参加一座新教堂的落成典礼，等他们返回时，路边站满了温顺谦卑的新教徒。这些新教徒朝天主教徒扔石头，直到整个地区附近都沾满血迹。但我想这只是天主教徒们的一面之词，事实似乎并非如此。","Belfast is a peculiarly religious community.This may be said of the whole of the North of Ireland.About one-half of the people are Protestants and the other half Catholics.Each party does all it can to make its own doctrines popular and draw the affections of the irreligious toward them.One hears constantly of the most touching instances of this zeal.A week ago a vast concourse of Catholics assembled at Armagh to dedicate a new Cathedral; and when they started home again the roadways were lined with groups of meek and lowly Protestants who stoned them till all the region round about was marked with blood.I thought that only Catholics argued in that way, but it seems to be a mistake."
"可以说，贝尔法斯特中的每个居民都是传教士，拎着砖头准备还以颜色。虽然法律试图改变这种现状，但结果并不理想。法律规定：严禁滥用过激的“教派口号”，违者处以四十先令罚款，并承担相应的诉讼费用。即便这样，在警察局审理的案件中，每天都能看到这类罚款的记录。上周，一个十二岁的小姑娘因在大街上公开宣称自己是“新教徒”而被处以四十先令的罚款，并承担相应的诉讼费用。通常的教派口号有“和教皇一起去死吧！”或“清教徒去死吧！”信奉的救世体系不同，口号也不一样。贝尔法斯特当地流传一个非常有意思的笑话。这则笑话与喊教派口号一律要被处罚四十先令有关——顺便提一句，这么多罚款对手头不宽裕的穷人来说数额不小。据说，有一次警察发现一个醉鬼躺在黑乎乎的巷子里，自娱自乐地吼着：“去死吧！”“去死吧！”警察立即嗅到了罚款的味道——举报人将得到一半罚金。“你在喊什么？”“去死！”“谁去死？和谁去死？”“哎哟，我的老天爷，您自己说完吧——太贵了，我可说不起！”我想，被罚款而限制住的煽动性倾向已经在这里面得到了很好的体现。","Every man in the community is a missionary and carries a brick to admonish the erring with.The law has tried to break this up, but not with perfect success.It has decreed that irritating “party cries” shall not be indulged in, and that persons uttering them shall be fined forty shillings and costs.And so, in the police court reports every day, one sees these fines recorded.Last week a girl of twelve years old was fined the usual forty shillings and costs for proclaiming in the public streets that she was “a Protestant.”The usual cry is, “To hell with the Pope!” or “To hell with the Protestants!” according to the utterer’s system of salvation.One of Belfast’s local jokes was very good.It referred to the uniform and inevitable fine of forty shillings and costs for uttering a party cry—and it is no economical fine for a poor man, either, by the way.They say that a policeman found a drunken man lying on the ground, up a dark alley, entertaining himself with shouting, “To hell with!”“To hell with!”The officer smelt a fine—informers get half.“What’s that you say?”“To hell with!”“To hell with who?To hell with what?”“Ah, bedad, ye can finish it yourself—it’s too expansive for me!”I think the seditious disposition, restrained by the economical instinct, is finely put in that."
