"丛林中的孩子","Babes in the Jungle"
"作者：欧·亨利","by O. Henry"
"蒙塔古·西尔弗是西部最好的街头推销员和赝品贩子。在小石城时，有一次他对我说：“比利，要是你脑子不中用了，老得不能在成年人中间做正经的骗局了，你就去纽约吧。在西部，每分钟产生一个冤大头；但在纽约呢，冤大头就好像鱼卵一般，数不胜数！”","Montague Silver, the finest street man and art grafter in the West, says to me once in Little Rock: “If you ever lose your mind, Billy, and get too old to do honest swindling among grown men, go to New York.In the West a sucker is born every minute; but in New York they appear in chunks of roe—you can’t count ’em!”"
"两年后，我发现我记不住那些俄国海军上将的名字了，并且左鬓已灰白。我知道，是听从西尔弗建议的时候了。","Two years afterward I found that I couldn’t remember the names of the Russian admirals, and I noticed some gray hairs over my left ear; so I knew the time had arrived for me to take Silver’s advice."
"一天，我中午时分抵达了纽约，然后去百老汇走了走。我居然遇见了西尔弗。他衣着华丽，斜靠在一家旅馆前，用一条丝质手帕擦拭着他指甲上的半月痕。","I struck New York about noon one day, and took a walk up Broadway.And I run against Silver himself, all encompassed up in a spacious kind of haberdashery, leaning against a hotel and rubbing the half-moons on his nails with a silk handkerchief."
"“你是得了麻痹性痴呆症，还是退休了？”我问他。","“Paresis or superannuated?” I asked him."
"“你好啊，比利，”西尔弗说，“见到你真高兴。不错，对我而言，西部人似乎逐渐变得有点太精明了。我一直把纽约留着，当作最后的点心。我知道，从纽约人身上揩油有点低能。他们懵懵懂懂，忙忙碌碌，不怎么用脑子。我真不愿意让我母亲知道我在剥这帮头脑简单的人的头皮（“剥头皮”表“骗钱、欺骗”之意——编者注）。她本想把我培养得更有出息的。”","“Hello, Billy,” says Silver; “I’m glad to see you.Yes, it seemed to me that the West was accumulating a little too much wiseness.I’ve been saving New York for dessert.I know it’s a low-down trick to take things from these people.They only know this and that and pass to and fro and think ever and anon.I’d hate for my mother to know I was skinning these weak-minded ones.She raised me better.”"
"“那么说来，做植皮手术的老医生的候诊室里已经人满为患了吧？”我问道。","“Is there a crush already in the waiting rooms of the old doctor that does skin grafting?” I asks."
"“呃，那倒没有，”西尔弗说，“当下还不用寻思剥皮的勾当。我来这里不过一个月。但是，我已经准备好实施大计了。威利曼哈顿主日学校的学生们每人自愿捐了一块皮，撑起了我这身行头。他们完全可以把相片寄到《每日晚报》去留名的。","“Well, no,” says Silver; “you needn’t back Epidermis to win to-day.I’ve only been here a month.But I’m ready to begin; and the members of Willie Manhattan’s Sunday School class, each of whom has volunteered to contribute a portion of cuticle toward this rehabilitation, may as well send their photos to the @Evening Daily@."
"“我一直在研究这座城市，”西尔弗说，“每天我都读报。我了解这座城市，就像市政厅的猫了解爱尔兰籍的警察一样。你从这里的人身上刮钱刮得哪怕慢了一点点，他们都会满地打滚，胡嚷乱叫。去我的房间，我详细和你说说吧。比利，看在往日交情的份上，我们一起来收拾这座城市吧。”","“I’ve been studying the town,” says Silver, “and reading the papers every day, and I know it as well as the cat in the City Hall knows an O’Sullivan.People here lie down on the floor and scream and kick when you are the least bit slow about taking money from them.Come up in my room and I’ll tell you.We’ll work the town together, Billy, for the sake of old times.”"
"西尔弗把我带进一家旅馆。他房间里乱七八糟地放着各种不相干的东西。","Silver takes me up in a hotel.He has a quantity of irrelevant objects lying about."
"“从这群大城市里的乡巴佬手中挣钱的方法，”西尔弗说，“比南卡罗来纳州查尔斯顿煮米饭的方法还要多。不论下什么饵，他们都会上钩。他们中大部分人的脑筋都相差无几。他们的智力越高，洞察力就越低。不信？前不久不是还有个家伙把小洛克菲勒的油画肖像当作安德烈亚·德尔萨尔托画的著名的青年圣约翰像卖给J. P. 摩根嘛！”","“There’s more ways of getting money from these metropolitan hayseeds,” says Silver, “than there is of cooking rice in Charleston, S. C.They’ll bite at anything.The brains of most of ’em commute.The wiser they are in intelligence the less perception of cognizance they have.Why, didn’t a man the other day sell J. P. Morgan an oil portrait of Rockefeller, Jr., for Andrea del Sarto’s celebrated painting of the young Saint John!"
"“你看到角落里那捆印刷品了没，比利？那是金矿股票。有一天我拿着它们出去推销，但不到两个小时我就被迫住手了。为什么？我堵塞了街道，被捕了。人们争相来购买。去警察局的路上，我卖了一些给警察，然后我就不卖了。我不愿意人们轻易地把钱给我。为了不伤及我的自尊，我总是愿意交易时给别人一点好处。他们给我哪怕一分钱之前，我总让他们先猜一猜在芝—哥中间缺了哪个字，或是打牌赌博时让他们先拿到一对九。","“You see that bundle of printed stuff in the corner, Billy?That’s gold mining stock.I started out one day to sell that, but I quit it in two hours.Why?Got arrested for blocking the street.People fought to buy it.I sold the policeman a block of it on the way to the station-house, and then I took it off the market.I don’t want people to give me their money.I want some little consideration connected with the transaction to keep my pride from being hurt.I want ’em to guess the missing letter in Chic—go, or draw to a pair of nines before they pay me a cent of money."
"“现在还有另一个小计谋，同样也太容易得手了，以至于我不得不罢手。你看到桌上那瓶蓝墨水没？我在手背上画了个船锚，假装是刺青，然后去了银行，说我是海军上将杜威的侄子。我开了一千美元的支票，从他名下支取，银行愿意付现。可是我只知道这位叔叔的姓，不知道他名叫什么。虽然最后没有成功，但这足以说明，这座城市多容易搞钱！这儿的窃贼现在都不入室了，除非给他们准备好热气腾腾的晚餐，再有几个大学生在一旁伺候。强盗在市区到处杀人，依我看，走遍全市也只算一桩简单的人身伤害案子。”","“Now there’s another little scheme that worked so easy I had to quit it.You see that bottle of blue ink on the table?I tattooed an anchor on the back of my hand and went to a bank and told ’em I was Admiral Dewey’s nephew.They offered to cash my draft on him for a thousand, but I didn’t know my uncle’s first name.It shows, though, what an easy town it is.As for burglars, they won’t go in a house now unless there’s a hot supper ready and a few college students to wait on ’em.They’re slugging citizens all over the upper part of the city and I guess, taking the town from end to end, it’s a plain case of assault and Battery.”"
"西尔弗歇了下来，我说：“蒙蒂，你的高论或许切中了曼哈顿的要害，但我对此表示怀疑。我才在这城市呆了两个小时，不过我可不认为它会轻易落到我们手里。这里没有适合我的乡下气氛。如果这儿的居民们头发里插着一根或几根稻草、身穿仿天鹅绒背心、戴着夸张的七叶树表坠，那我会满意得多。依我看，他们不容易上钩。”","“Monty,” says I, when Silver had slacked, up, “you may have Manhattan correctly discriminated in your perorative, but I doubt it.I’ve only been in town two hours, but it don’t dawn upon me that it’s ours with a cherry in it.There ain’t enough rus in urbe about it to suit me.I’d be a good deal much better satisfied if the citizens had a straw or more in their hair, and run more to velveteen vests and buckeye watch charms.They don’t look easy to me.”"
"“你说得对，比利，”西尔弗说，“初来乍到的人都有你这样的感觉。纽约比小石城和欧洲大，它让外来人害怕。你会打消恐惧的。我告诉你，这里的人们没有把钱全掏出来，放在洗衣篮里，再喷上消毒剂给我送过来，我真想掴他们耳光。我讨厌去街上搞钱。这城里戴钻石首饰的是谁？哟，是骗子的老婆温妮，是恶棍的新娘贝拉！骗纽约人的钱真是易如反掌。唯一困扰着我的事情是，我知道，当我衣服里塞满了二十美金的钞票时，我背心口袋里的雪茄会被挤断。”","“You’ve got it, Billy,” says Silver.“All emigrants have it.New York’s bigger than Little Rock or Europe, and it frightens a foreigner.You’ll be all right.I tell you I feel like slapping the people here because they don’t send me all their money in laundry baskets, with germicide sprinkled over it.I hate to go down on the street to get it.Who wears the diamonds in this town?Why, Winnie, the Wiretapper’s wife, and Bella, the Buncosteerer’s bride.New Yorkers can be worked easier than a blue rose on a tidy.The only thing that bothers me is I know I’ll break the cigars in my vest pocket when I get my clothes all full of twenties.”"
"“我希望你是对的，蒙蒂，”我说，“但我还是后悔没在小石城安心做点小买卖。与这里不同，那里总有不少农场主，你尽可以找上几个，让他们在新邮局成立申请书上签字，然后拿去乡镇银行，贷出个二百美金。这里的人看上去天生就保守得要命，而且相当吝啬。恐怕凭我们俩的本事，在这里干不了这一行。”","“I hope you are right, Monty,” says I; “but I wish all the same I had been satisfied with a small business in Little Rock.The crop of farmers is never so short out there but what you can get a few of ’em to sign a petition for a new post office that you can discount for $200 at the county bank.The people here appear to possess instincts of self-preservation and illiberality.I fear me that we are not cultured enough to tackle this game.”"
"“别担心，”西尔弗说，“这座涂了柏油的鸟村镇我早就已经看透了，我很确定我的估计没错，就像我很确定北河是哈得孙河而东江压根不是一条江一样。你瞧，住在百老汇四个街区以内的人，一辈子除了摩天大楼就没见过其他建筑！一个优秀能干的西部人来这里两三个月，总该露两手，哪怕是软哄硬骗也好啊。”","“Don’t worry,” says Silver.“I’ve got this Jayville-near-Tarrytown correctly estimated as sure as North River is the Hudson and East River ain’t a river.Why, there are people living in four blocks of Broadway who never saw any kind of a building except a skyscraper in their lives!A good, live hustling Western man ought to get conspicuous enough here inside of three months to incur either Jerome’s clemency or Lawson’s displeasure.”"
"“夸张归夸张，”我说，“除了向救世军求助和站在海伦·古尔德小姐的门阶上装模作样以外，你有没有具体的计划，好立刻从这些人身上弄个一块两块的来花花？”","“Hyperbole aside,” says I, “do you know of any immediate system of buncoing the community out of a dollar or two except by applying to the Salvation Army or having a fit on Miss Helen Gould’s doorsteps?”"
"“一打我都有，”西尔弗说，“你有多少资本，比利？”","“Dozens of ’em,” says Silver.“How much capital have you got, Billy?”"
"“一千块。”我告诉他。","“A thousand,” I told him."
"“我有一千二，”他说，“我们合伙大干一场吧。发大财的路子实在太多啦，我都不知道该如何着手了。”","“I’ve got $1,200,” says he.“We’ll pool and do a big piece of business.There’s so many ways we can make a million that I don’t know how to begin.”"
"第二天一早，西尔弗就来我住的旅馆找我，他容光焕发，好像有着说不出的高兴。","The next morning Silver meets me at the hotel and he is all sonorous and stirred with a kind of silent joy."
"“今天下午，我们去见J. P. 摩根。”他说，“我在旅馆认识了一个人，他要给我们引见。他是摩根先生的朋友。他说，摩根先生喜欢见见西部来的人。”","“We’re to meet J. P. Morgan this afternoon,” says he.“A man I know in the hotel wants to introduce us.He’s a friend of his.He says he likes to meet people from the West.”"
"“这听起来不赖，”我说，“我乐意认识摩根先生。”","“That sounds nice and plausible,” says I.“I’d like to know Mr. Morgan.”"
"“认识几个金融大亨，”西尔弗说，“对我们而言是没有丝毫坏处的。我有点喜欢纽约对待外地人的那种社交方式了。”","“It won’t hurt us a bit,” says Silver, “to get acquainted with a few finance kings.I kind of like the social way New York has with strangers.”"
"西尔弗认识的那个人姓克莱因。下午三点，克莱因带着他那位华尔街的朋友来西尔弗的房间与我们见面。“摩根先生”看起来和他的肖像画里的模样差不多。他左脚上缠着一条土耳其毛巾，走路拄着拐杖。","The man Silver knew was named Klein.At three o’clock Klein brought his Wall Street friend to see us in Silver’s room.“Mr. Morgan” looked some like his pictures, and he had a Turkish towel wrapped around his left foot, and he walked with a cane."
"“西尔弗先生，佩斯柯德先生，”克莱因介绍道，“提这位先生的名字似乎有点多余，这位就是最伟大的金融——”","“Mr. Silver and Mr. Pescud,” says Klein.“It sounds superfluous,” says he, “to mention the name of the greatest financial—” "
"“打住，克莱因，”摩根先生说，“很高兴认识你们二位；我对西部很有兴趣。克莱因告诉我，你们是从小石城来的。我在那边的某个地方应该有一两条铁路。如果你们二位愿意打上一两把梭哈的话，我——”","“Cut it out, Klein,” says Mr. Morgan.“I’m glad to know you gents; I take great interest in the West.Klein tells me you’re from Little Rock.I think I’ve a railroad or two out there somewhere.If either of you guys would like to deal a hand or two of stud poker I—” "
"“唉，皮尔庞特，”克莱因插嘴道，“你忘啦！”","“Now, Pierpont,” cuts in Klein, “you forget!”"
"“对不起，先生们，”摩根说，“自从害了严重的痛风症以来，我有时会在家里玩玩社会上风行的纸牌游戏。在小石城时，你们认不认识独眼彼得斯？他住在新墨西哥州的西雅图市。”","“Excuse me, gents!” says Morgan; “since I’ve had the gout so bad I sometimes play a social game of cards at my house.Neither of you never knew One-eyed Peters, did you, while you was around Little Rock?He lived in Seattle, New Mexico.”"
"我们还未及回答，摩根先生就用他的拐杖敲着地板，开始来回走动，同时嘴里大声咒骂起来。","Before we could answer, Mr. Morgan hammers on the floor with his cane and begins to walk up and down, swearing in a loud tone of voice."
"“今天华尔街有人把你的股票抛售了吗，皮尔庞特？”克莱因笑着问道。","“They have been pounding your stocks to-day on the Street, Pierpont?” asks Klein, smiling."
"“股票！不！”摩根先生吼将起来，“是我派人去欧洲收购的那幅画。我刚想起来。他今天给我发电报说，找遍了全意大利也弄不到那幅画。我明天要花五万美元买那幅画——是的，七万五千美元也成。我让我派去的人相机行事。我真搞不懂，为什么那些美术馆会愿意让一幅达芬奇——”","“Stocks!No!” roars Mr. Morgan.“It’s that picture I sent an agent to Europe to buy.I just thought about it.He cabled me to-day that it ain’t to be found in all Italy.I’d pay $50,000 to-morrow for that picture—yes, $75,000.I give the agent a la carte in purchasing it.I cannot understand why the art galleries will allow a De Vinchy to—” "
"“什么？摩根先生，”克莱因说，“我以为你已经拥有达芬奇全部的画作了哩。”","“Why, Mr. Morgan,” says klein; “I thought you owned all of the De Vinchy paintings.”"
"“那幅画是什么样子的，摩根先生？”西尔弗问道，“想必和熨斗大厦的一面一样大吧。”","“What is the picture like, Mr. Morgan?” asks Silver.“It must be as big as the side of the Flatiron Building.”"
"“恐怕你的艺术修养太差啦，西尔弗先生，”摩根说，“那幅画27英寸高，42英寸宽，名叫《爱的闲暇》。它画的是几个穿着宽大外衣的模特在一条紫色的河的岸上跳两步舞。水线电报说，那幅画可能已经被带到美国来了。没有那幅画，我的收藏永远不能齐全。好吧，先生们，再见吧；我们金融家必须早睡早起。”","“I’m afraid your art education is on the bum, Mr. Silver,” says Morgan.“The picture is 27 inches by 42; and it is called ‘Love’s Idle Hour.’It represents a number of cloak models doing the two-step on the bank of a purple river.The cablegram said it might have been brought to this country.My collection will never be complete without that picture.Well, so long, gents; us financiers must keep early hours.”"
"摩根先生和克莱因一同坐着出租马车离去了。我和西尔弗谈论着大人物可真是头脑简单、对人没有疑心；西尔弗说，试图诈骗像摩根先生这样的人可真是让人蒙羞；我说，我个人也认为这么做很不恰当。晚饭后，克莱因建议去散步，我和他以及西尔弗便去第七大街观光。克莱因看到当铺橱窗内的一对袖扣，十分中意，于是，他去买的时候我们都走了进去。","Mr. Morgan and Klein went away together in a cab.Me and Silver talked about how simple and unsuspecting great people was; and Silver said what a shame it would be to try to rob a man like Mr. Morgan; and I said I thought it would be rather imprudent, myself.Klein proposes a stroll after dinner; and me and him and Silver walks down toward Seventh Avenue to see the sights.Klein sees a pair of cuff links that instigate his admiration in a pawnshop window, and we all go in while he buys ’em."
"我们回到旅馆、克莱因离去以后，西尔弗手舞足蹈地朝我蹦了过来。","After we got back to the hotel and Klein had gone, Silver jumps at me and waves his hands."
"“你看到没有？”他说，“你看到没有，比利？”","“Did you see it?” says he.“Did you see it, Billy?”"
"“看到什么？”我问。","“What?” I asks."
"“什么？摩根想要的那幅画呀。它就挂在那家当铺的写字台后面。当时克莱因在场，所以我绝口不提。千真万确，就是那幅画。那些女孩儿真是画得没法更栩栩如生了，如果穿上裙子，她们一定合乎胸围36、腰围25、臀围42的尺码。她们正在河岸上随着布鲁斯跳着慢四。摩根先生说他愿意为这幅画付多少钱来着？噢，不用我来告诉你吧。当铺里的人绝对不知道他们当铺里存着什么宝贝！”","“Why, that picture that Morgan wants.It’s hanging in that pawnshop, behind the desk.I didn’t say anything because Klein was there.It’s the article sure as you live.The girls are as natural as paint can make them, all measuring 36 and 25 and 42 skirts, if they had any skirts, and they’re doing a buck-and-wing on the bank of a river with the blues.What did Mr. Morgan say he’d give for it?Oh, don’t make me tell you.They can’t know what it is in that pawnshop.”"
"第二天早上，当铺开门时，我和西尔弗正焦急不安地站在门口，像是急于把我们的衣物行头典当了去买酒喝一样。我们走进里面闲逛，开始装模作样地看看表链。","When the pawnshop opened the next morning me and Silver was standing there as anxious as if we wanted to soak our Sunday suit to buy a drink.We sauntered inside, and began to look at watch-chains."
"“你们挂在上面的那幅彩色石印画太粗糙了，”西尔弗随便地对着当铺老板点评道，“不过，我有点喜欢那个露着肩胛、披着红发的女孩。我出两美元二十五美分买它，这样你就能迅速出手了，怎么样？”","“That’s a violent specimen of a chromo you’ve got up there,” remarked Silver, casual, to the pawnbroker.“But I kind of enthuse over the girl with the shoulder-blades and red bunting.Would an offer of $2.25 for it cause you to knock over any fragile articles of your stock in hurrying it off the nail?”"
"当铺老板微笑着，继续拿出镀金表链给我们看。","The pawnbroker smiles and goes on showing us plate watch-chains."
"“那幅画，”他说道，“是一年前一位意大利人典当的。我抵借了500美元给他。那幅画名叫《爱的闲暇》，是莱昂纳多·达芬奇的作品。两天前，法定抵押时间到了头，它也就没法再被赎回去了。这儿有一种表链的样式，现在非常流行。”","“That picture,” says he, “was pledged a year ago by an Italian gentleman.I loaned him $500 on it.It is called ‘Love’s Idle Hour,’ and it is by Leonardo de Vinchy.Two days ago the legal time expired, and it became an unredeemed pledge.Here is a style of chain that is worn a great deal now.”"
"半小时后，我和西尔弗给了当铺老板2000美元，带着那幅画离开了当铺。西尔弗拿着画坐上一辆出租马车，直奔摩根先生的办公室。我回旅馆去等他。两小时后，西尔弗回来了。","At the end of half an hour me and Silver paid the pawnbroker $2,000 and walked out with the picture.Silver got into a cab with it and started for Morgan’s office.I goes to the hotel and waits for him.In two hours Silver comes back."
"“你见着摩根先生了没？”我问道，“他给你多少钱买那幅画？”","“Did you see Mr. Morgan?” I asks.“How much did he pay you for it?”"
"西尔弗坐下来，拨弄着桌布上的流苏。","Silver sits down and fools with a tassel on the table cover."
"“我压根从没见过摩根先生，”他说，“因为摩根先生一个月前就已经去了欧洲。但有一件事我搞不懂，比利，就是，所有的百货公司都在卖那幅画，带框的，每幅三美元四十八美分。可是，光买画框，他们却要价三美元五十美分一个——这真叫我搞不明白了！”","“I never exactly saw Mr. Morgan,” he says, “because Mr. Morgan’s been in Europe for a month.But what’s worrying me, Billy, is this: The department stores have all got that same picture on sale, framed, for $3.48.And they charge $3.50 for the frame alone—that’s what I can’t understand.”"
