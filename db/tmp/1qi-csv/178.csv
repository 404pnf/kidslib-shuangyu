"远在他乡","In a Far Country"
"作者：杰克·伦敦","by Jack London"
"如果一个人动身去一个遥远的国家，那他必须做好准备，忘掉学到的许多东西，然后习得那个新地方的固有习俗；他必须放弃原先的理想和原先信仰的神灵，而且往往要颠覆之前一直遵循的行为准则。对于那些适应能力强的人来说，变化带来的新鲜感或许还会成为乐趣的来源。但是，对于那些恰巧固守老规矩的人来说，一直接触的都是这些规矩，环境变化带来的压力则是难以承受的。在那些他们不能理解的新规矩的约束下，他们的身心都会受到损伤。这种损伤必定会发生作用并产生影响，导致各种各样的灾难，引发各种不幸。如果一个人不能适应新的常规，那最好回到自己的故乡去；如果他拖延的时间过长，肯定是要死的。","When a man journeys into a far country, he must be prepared to forget many of the things he has learned, and to acquire such customs as are inherent with existence in the new land; he must abandon the old ideals and the old gods, and oftentimes he must reverse the very codes by which his conduct has hitherto been shaped.To those who have the protean faculty of adaptability, the novelty of such change may even be a source of pleasure; but to those who happen to be hardened to the ruts in which they were created, the pressure of the altered environment is unbearable, and they chafe in body and in spirit under the new restrictions which they do not understand.This chafing is bound to act and react, producing divers evils and leading to various misfortunes.It were better for the man who cannot fit himself to the new groove to return to his own country; if he delay too long, he will surely die."
"那些抛弃了自己原来所熟悉的文化、去面对北方的野蛮蒙昧和原始朴素的人可能会估计，他的成功和自己那些没有希望改掉的习惯的数量以及质量成反比。他很快就会发现，如果自己是个合适的人选，那么物质上的习惯是没那么重要的。把精致的佳肴换成简单的饭菜，把硬挺的皮鞋换成柔软不成形的软帮鞋，把羽毛褥垫换成雪中的长椅，所有这样的转换毕竟是非常容易的事。最紧要的是，他得正确地塑造自己对待一切事物的态度，尤其是对同伴的态度。对于日常生活中的礼节，他必须用无私、宽容和忍耐代替。这样，而且只有这样，他才能得到那价格不菲的珍珠，也就是真正的同志情谊。他不能说“谢谢”，必须不开口就把这个意思表达出来，必须用同样的方式回应，证明自己的谢意。简单地说，就是他必须用行动代替语言，用精神实质代替字面意义。","The man who turns his back upon the comforts of an elder civilization, to face the savage youth, the primordial simplicity of the North, may estimate success at an inverse ratio to the quantity and quality of his hopelessly fixed habits.He will soon discover, if he be a fit candidate, that the material habits are the less important.The exchange of such things as a dainty menu for rough fare, of the stiff leather shoe for the soft, shapeless moccasin, of the feather bed for a couch in the snow, is after all a very easy matter.But his pinch will come in learning properly to shape his mind’s attitude toward all things, and especially toward his fellow man.For the courtesies of ordinary life, he must substitute unselfishness, forbearance, and tolerance.Thus, and thus only, can he gain that pearl of great price,—true comradeship.He must not say “Thank you;” he must mean it without opening his mouth, and prove it by responding in kind.In short, he must substitute the deed for the word, the spirit for the letter."
"当北极有黄金的传闻在世界上盛传时，北方的诱惑便牵动了人们的心弦。卡特·韦瑟比放弃了舒适的文书工作，把一半的存款移交给了妻子，用剩下的钱买了一套装备。他的性格中没有冒险精神——商务的束缚已经粉碎了所有的浪漫想法，他只是厌倦了无休止的苦差事，考虑到相应的回报，他愿意冒巨大的危险。和其他许多蠢人一样，他鄙视北国拓荒者二十年来一直走的老路线。这年的春天，他便匆忙赶去埃德蒙顿，在那里，他和一群人结成联盟，这对他的心灵健康来说很不幸。","When the world rang with the tale of Arctic gold, and the lure of the North gripped the heartstrings of men, Carter Weatherbee threw up his snug clerkship, turned the half of his savings over to his wife, and with the remainder bought an outfit.There was no romance in his nature,—the bondage of commerce had crushed all that; he was simply tired of the ceaseless grind, and wished to risk great hazards in view of corresponding returns.Like many another fool, disdaining the old trails used by the Northland pioneers for a score of years, he hurried to Edmonton in the spring of the year; and there, unluckily for his soul’s welfare, he allied himself with a party of men."
"这个联盟没有什么特殊之处，除了它的那些计划。即便是它的目的地，也和其它团体一样，是克朗代克。但是他们制定的去往目的地的路线令最强壮的本地人都喘不过气来，那些本地人在西北部的变迁中出生、长大。即使是雅克·巴普蒂斯特——奥吉布瓦女人和叛逆的船夫所生的儿子——也很吃惊。（他在北纬六十五度以北的一个鹿皮小屋里发出第一声呜咽，也是靠着幸福地吮吸生油脂安静了下来。）尽管他向他们出卖劳动，甚至答应去从未开辟过的冰面，但是每次问到他的意见时，他总是有不祥预感似的摇着头。","There was nothing unusual about this party, except its plans.Even its goal, like that of all other parties, was the Klondike.But the route it had mapped out to attain that goal took away the breath of the hardiest native, born and bred to the vicissitudes of the Northwest.Even Jacques Baptiste, born of a Chippewa woman and a renegade voyageur (having raised his first whimpers in a deerskin lodge north of the sixty-fifth parallel, and had the same hushed by blissful sucks of raw tallow), was surprised.Though he sold his services to them and agreed to travel even to the never-opening ice, he shook his head ominously whenever his advice was asked."
"珀西·卡斯费特一定是灾星当头，因为他也加入了这群淘金者。他是一个普通人，他的银行账户和他的文化修养一样深厚，意思是说他的存款很多。他没有理由开始这次冒险，世界上也找不出任何理由，除非他在情感上有些不正常。他错把这次冒险当成是浪漫和探险的真正内涵所在。许多人也做过类似的事，犯下这样致命的错误。","Percy Cuthfert’s evil star must have been in the ascendant, for he, too, joined this company of argonauts.He was an ordinary man, with a bank account as deep as his culture, which is saying a good deal.He had no reason to embark on such a venture,—no reason in the world, save that he suffered from an abnormal development of sentimentality.He mistook this for the true spirit of romance and adventure.Many another man has done the like, and made as fatal a mistake."
"春天第一次解冻时，这群人就沿着埃尔克河的融冰流出发了。　　　　　　这个船队声势浩大，因为人员很多，而且跟他们一起的还有一群名声不好的混血船夫以及他们的老婆孩子。日复一日，他们奋力划着平底船和独木舟，与蚊子及其他同类害虫作斗争，或者在搬东西时，一边卖力干活一边咒骂。像这样辛苦的劳作使人显露出了最真实的自我，在阿萨巴斯卡湖在南面消失之前，这个群体中的每一个成员都露出了真面目。","The first break-up of spring found the party following the ice-run of Elk River.It was an imposing fleet, for the outfit was large, and they were accompanied by a disreputable contingent of half-breed voyageurs with their women and children.Day in and day out, they labored with the bateaux and canoes, fought mosquitoes and other kindred pests, or sweated and swore at the portages.Severe toil like this lays a man naked to the very roots of his soul, and ere Lake Athabasca was lost in the south, each member of the party had hoisted his true colors."
"那两个偷懒并经常发牢骚的人就是卡特·韦瑟比和珀西·卡斯费特。整个队伍对辛劳、痛苦的埋怨都没有他们俩当中的任何一个多。营地里有许许多多的小事，他们没有主动做过一次。比如打一桶水，多劈一抱木头，刷洗、擦干一些盘子，在全套装备中寻找某件突然急需的物品等等，而这两个娇气的城市人一扭到或者一磨出水泡就需要立即护理。晚上，他们俩是最先钻进被窝的，还有一堆事情没有做；早上，他们是最后起来的，而出发的准备工作在早饭开始之前就该做好。吃饭时他们最先开始吃，做饭时最后一个帮忙；他们最先向为数不多的美味佳肴扑过去，最后一个发现别人的那一份已经在自己碗里。如果他们辛苦地划桨，就会狡猾地每划一下就在水里停一下，然后让船的动力使桨叶浮起来。他们以为没人注意到，但同伴们低声咒骂他们，并且开始讨厌他们，而雅克·巴普蒂斯特公开嘲笑他们，还从早到晚地指责他们。但雅克·巴普蒂斯特不是什么绅士。","The two shirks and chronic grumblers were Carter Weatherbee and Percy Cuthfert.The whole party complained less of its aches and pains than did either of them.Not once did they volunteer for the thousand and one petty duties of the camp.A bucket of water to be brought, an extra armful of wood to be chopped, the dishes to be washed and wiped, a search to be made through the outfit for some suddenly indispensable article,—and these two effete scions of civilization discovered sprains or blisters requiring instant attention.They were the first to turn in at night, with a score of tasks yet undone; the last to turn out in the morning, when the start should be in readiness before the breakfast was begun.They were the first to fall to at meal-time, the last to have a hand in the cooking; the first to dive for a slim delicacy, the last to discover they had added to their own another man’s share.If they toiled at the oars, they slyly cut the water at each stroke and allowed the boat’s momentum to float up the blade.They thought nobody noticed; but their comrades swore under their breaths and grew to hate them, while Jacques Baptiste sneered openly and damned them from morning till night.But Jacques Baptiste was no gentleman."
"在大奴湖，他们买了些哈得孙湾狗，船队由于添加了干鱼和干肉饼而沉到了警戒线之下。然后独木舟和平底船遇到了马更些河湍急的水流，它们冲进了大荒地。每一条貌似可能的“支流”都勘察到了，但是那难以捉摸的“可采矿石”总是跳跃着朝北去。在大熊湖，由于对未知大陆通常都有恐惧，他们的船夫受不了便开始纷纷离开。到古德霍普堡时，只剩下最勇敢的一些人，他们向下冲入刚才冒着危险划过的水流中时，全力拉着拖索。雅克·巴普蒂斯特一个人留了下来。他不是发过誓，即使是无人涉足过的冰面他也要去吗？","At the Great Slave, Hudson Bay dogs were purchased, and the fleet sank to the guards with its added burden of dried fish and pemmican.Then canoe and bateau answered to the swift current of the Mackenzie, and they plunged into the Great Barren Ground.Every likely-looking “feeder” was prospected, but the elusive “pay-dirt” danced ever to the north.At the Great Bear, overcome by the common dread of the Unknown Lands, their voyageurs began to desert, and Fort of Good Hope saw the last and bravest bending to the tow-lines as they bucked the current down which they had so treacherously glided.Jacques Baptiste alone remained.Had he not sworn to travel even to the never-opening ice?"
"那骗人的航海图基本上是按照传闻绘制的，可他们现在要不断地查阅它。他们也感觉到需要加快进度了，因为北半球的夏至日已经过去了，太阳正在使冬天的范围再次向南扩展。　　他们沿着海湾的岸边行进，进入了小皮尔河的河口。马更些河从海湾处汇入北冰洋。然后他们开始费力地逆流而上，而那两个无用之人干得比先前更糟了。拖索和桅杆，桨和扎带，急流和搬运工作，这些折磨使其中一些人对巨大的危险深恶痛绝，而使另外一些人铭记了这个关于探险真正传奇性的激烈篇章。　　有一天他们失控了，雅克·巴普蒂斯特用脏话咒骂他们，他们被逼急了，就反抗起来。但是那个混血男人用鞭子抽打这两个人，还让他们带着伤流着血就去干活。　　这是这两个人第一次被粗暴地对待。","The lying charts, compiled in main from hearsay, were now constantly consulted.And they felt the need of hurry, for the sun had already passed its northern solstice and was leading the winter south again.Skirting the shores of the bay, where the Mackenzie disembogues into the Arctic Ocean, they entered the mouth of the Little Peel River.Then began the arduous up-stream toil, and the two Incapables fared worse than ever.Tow-line and pole, paddle and tump-line, rapids and portages,—such tortures served to give the one a deep digust for great hazards, and printed for the other a fiery text on the true romance of adventure.One day they waxed mutinous, and being vilely cursed by Jacques Baptiste, turned, as worms sometimes will.But the half-breed thrashed the twain, and sent them, bruised and bleeding, about their work.It was the first time either had been man-handled."
"在小皮尔河上游，他们丢弃了小河船，夏天剩下的时间，他们都在马更些河流域把大量货物运往西拉特河。这条小河汇入波丘派恩河，而波丘派恩河又汇入育空河。在育空河那儿，那条浩瀚的北方交通要道掉头朝北极圈反方向行进。但是他们在与冬天的赛跑中失败了。有一天，他们把木筏拴在厚厚的漩涡冰上，然后匆忙地把他们的货物运上岸。那天晚上，河流多次冻住又裂开；第二天早晨，那条河永远地冻住了。　","Abandoning their river craft at the head-waters of the Little Peel, they consumed the rest of the summer in the great portage over the Mackenzie watershed to the West Rat.This little stream fed the Porcupine, which in turn joined the Yukon where that mighty highway of the North countermarches on the Arctic Circle.But they had lost in the race with winter, and one day they tied their rafts to the thick eddy-ice and hurried their goods ashore.That night the river jammed and broke several times; the following morning it had fallen asleep for good."
"“我们距离育空河不可能超过四百英里。”斯洛珀推断道，他用两个拇指指甲的长度乘以地图的比例尺。委员会快要解体了，在这个委员会中，那两个无用之人一直抱怨，已经使自己处于非常不利的地位。　　　“哈得孙湾标志杆存在于很长时间以前。现在已经不用了。”雅克·巴普蒂斯特的父亲从前为毛皮公司做事时到过这里，附带着用一对冰冻的脚趾留下了痕迹。　　","“We can’t be more ’n four hundred miles from the Yukon,” concluded Sloper, multiplying his thumb nails by the scale of the map.The council, in which the two Incapables had whined to excellent disadvantage, was drawing to a close.“Hudson Bay Post, long time ago.No use um now.”Jacques Baptiste’s father had made the trip for the Fur Company in the old days, incidentally marking the trail with a couple of frozen toes."
"“受够疯子了！”人群中有人喊道，“没有白人吗？”","“Sufferin’ cracky!” cried another of the party.“No whites?”"
"“没有白人，”斯洛珀很简洁地肯定道，“但是到了育空河，只要再往上走五百英里就能到道森了。距离这里大概是一千英里。”","“Nary white,” Sloper sententiously affirmed; “but it’s only five hundred more up the Yukon to Dawson.Call it a rough thousand from here.”"
"韦瑟比和卡斯费特异口同声地抱怨道：","Weatherbee and Cuthfert groaned in chorus."
"“那要花多长时间啊，巴普蒂斯特？”","“How long’ll that take, Baptiste?”"
"这个混血男人计算了一会儿。“极其辛苦地劳作，没有人倒下，也许十天、二十天、四十天、五十天。嗯，孩子们来”（指这两个无用之人），“没人能知道。或许要等到该死的冰全结上的时候，或许不是那时候。”","The half-breed figured for a moment.“Workum like hell, no man play out, ten—twenty—forty—fifty days.Um babies come” (designating the Incapables), “no can tell.Mebbe when hell freeze over; mebbe not then.”"
"雪地鞋和软帮鞋的生产停止了。有人叫了一个不在场的人的名字，被叫到的这个人从营火边的古老木屋里走出来，加入了他们的行列。　这个小木屋是个谜团，它是北方广阔、隐秘的土地上隐藏着的许多谜团中的一个。没有人知道是谁在什么时候建造了它。野外有两个坟墓，用石头堆得很高，或许这其中包含了那些早期流浪者的秘密。但是谁用手垒起了这些石头呢？","The manufacture of snowshoes and moccasins ceased.Somebody called the name of an absent member, who came out of an ancient cabin at the edge of the camp-fire and joined them.The cabin was one of the many mysteries which lurk in the vast recesses of the North.Built when and by whom, no man could tell.Two graves in the open, piled high with stones, perhaps contained the secret of those early wanderers.But whose hand had piled the stones?"
"这一时刻已经到来了。雅克·巴普蒂斯特停下来，装配好挽具，把奋力挣扎的狗按在雪地里。那个厨师为拖延时间做着无声的抗争，他将几块熏肉扔到一个装着豆子噼啪作响的锅里，然后站起来。斯洛珀站起身来。他的身体和那两个无用之人的健壮体格形成了滑稽可笑的对比。他面黄肌瘦，是从南美一个炽热的地方逃出来的，他不间断地跨越了多个地带，但还能和他们一起辛苦劳作。他的体重可能有九十磅，还得算上沉重的猎刀，那灰白的头发说明他的壮年时期已经过了。韦瑟比和卡斯费特年轻力壮，抵得上他十倍的努力，但是他却能在一天的行程里把他们两个走得累趴下。这一整天，他都在鞭打着比他强壮的两个同伴，让他们冒险去走人类所能想象出的最艰难的一千英里道路。他既有他那个民族的不安分，又有古日耳曼人的倔强，还掺杂着美国北方佬一流的理解力和行动力，这些把他的肉体束缚在了精神里。","The moment had come.Jacques Baptiste paused in the fitting of a harness and pinned the struggling dog in the snow.The cook made mute protest for delay, threw a handful of bacon into a noisy pot of beans, then came to attention.Sloper rose to his feet.His body was a ludicrous contrast to the healthy physiques of the Incapables.Yellow and weak, fleeing from a South American fever-hole, he had not broken his flight across the zones, and was still able to toil with men.His weight was probably ninety pounds, with the heavy hunting-knife thrown in, and his grizzled hair told of a prime which had ceased to be.The fresh young muscles of either Weatherbee or Cuthfert were equal to ten times the endeavor of his; yet he could walk them into the earth in a day’s journey.And all this day he had whipped his stronger comrades into venturing a thousand miles of the stiffest hardship man can conceive.He was the incarnation of the unrest of his race, and the old Teutonic stubbornness, dashed with the quick grasp and action of the Yankee, held the flesh in the bondage of the spirit."
"“赞成一结冰就带着狗继续前进的，说一声‘行’。”","“All those in favor of going on with the dogs as soon as the ice sets, say ay.”"
"“行！”八个人的声音响起，这声音注定串起他们在几百英里充满痛苦的道路上的誓言。","“Ay!” rang out eight voices,—voices destined to string a trail of oaths along many a hundred miles of pain."
"“有相反的意见吗？”","“Contrary minded?”"
"“没有！”这是那两个无用之人第一次在不放弃个人利益的情况下和大家达成一致意见。","“No!”For the first time the Incapables were united without some compromise of personal interests."
"“那你们打算怎么做？”韦瑟比用好斗的口吻加了一句。","“And what are you going to do about it?” Weatherbee added belligerently."
"“少数服从多数！少数服从多数！”其他人大声喊道。","“Majority rule!Majority rule!” clamored the rest of the party."
"“我知道如果你不来，这次探险很可能会成为泡影，”斯洛珀温和地答道，“但是我想，如果我们真正努力尝试，少了你我们也能做到。　　你们说呢，伙计们？”","“I know the expedition is liable to fall through if you don’t come,” Sloper replied sweetly; “but I guess, if we try real hard, we can manage to do without you.What do you say, boys?”"
"大家都为他的观点大声喝彩。","The sentiment was cheered to the echo."
"“但是我说，你知道的，”卡斯费特带着焦虑大胆问道，“像我这样的人能做什么呢？”","“But I say, you know,” Cuthfert ventured apprehensively; “what’s a chap like me to do?”"
"“你不和我们一起吗？”","“Ain’t you coming with us?”"
"“是的。”","“No-o.”"
"“那你就爱干什么干什么吧。我们不会什么都不说。”","“Then do as you damn well please.We won’t have nothing to say.”"
"“我看你可以和你那亲爱的伙伴一起解决这件事情。”一个来自达科他州的、非常难缠的西部人建议道，同时指出了韦瑟比。“到了做饭和捡柴火的时候，他一定会问你打算怎么做的。”","“Kind o’ calkilate yuh might settle it with that canoodlin’ pardner of yourn,” suggested a heavy-going Westerner from the Dakotas, at the same time pointing out Weatherbee.“He’ll be shore to ask yuh what yur a-goin’ to do when it comes to cookin’ an’ gatherin’ the wood.”"
"“那么我们就认为一切都安排好了。”斯洛珀总结道，“如果在五英里以内宿营，我们就明天出发——只是让一切准备就绪，再想想我们有没有落下什么东西。”","“Then we’ll consider it all arranged,” concluded Sloper.“We’ll pull out to-morrow, if we camp within five miles,—just to get everything in running order and remember if we ’ve forgotten anything.”"
"雪橇的钢铁滑板一路上吱嘎作响，狗低着身子用力拉雪橇，它们生来就是要死在挽具里的。雅克·巴普蒂斯特停在斯洛珀的旁边，想看木屋最后一眼。薄薄的烟雾从育空河边的火炉管里袅袅升起。那两个无用之人正在门口看着他们。","The sleds groaned by on their steel-shod runners, and the dogs strained low in the harnesses in which they were born to die.Jacques Baptiste paused by the side of Sloper to get a last glimpse of the cabin.The smoke curled up pathetically from the Yukon stove-pipe.The two Incapables were watching them from the doorway."
"斯洛珀把手放在巴普蒂斯特的肩上。","Sloper laid his hand on the other’s shoulder."
"“雅克·巴普蒂斯特，你听说过基尔肯尼猫吗？”","“Jacques Baptiste, did you ever hear of the Kilkenny cats?”"
"那个混血儿摇了摇头。","The half-breed shook his head."
"“我的朋友，我的好伙伴，基尔肯尼猫打起架来时，直到兽皮、毛发，以及号叫声都没有了，才会住手。你明白吗？直到一无所有。非常好。好吧，这两个人不喜欢工作。他们不会工作的。我们知道这一点。整个冬天——一个非常漫长、黑暗的冬天，他们都会独自呆在那个木屋里。打起架来不顾死活的动物，是吧？”","“Well, my friend and good comrade, the Kilkenny cats fought till neither hide, nor hair, nor yowl, was left.You understand?—till nothing was left.Very good.Now, these two men don’t like work.They won’t work.We know that.They’ll be all alone in that cabin all winter,—a mighty long, dark winter.Kilkenny cats,—well?”"
"巴普蒂斯特身上像法国人的那一面让他耸了耸肩，但是像印第安人的那一面却令他沉默不语。然而，他这次耸肩却是意味深长，预示着什么事情。","The Frenchman in Baptiste shrugged his shoulders, but the Indian in him was silent.Nevertheless, it was an eloquent shrug, pregnant with prophecy."
"一开始，小木屋里一切进展顺利。同伴们刺耳的玩笑话让韦瑟比和卡斯费特意识到了他们共同承担的责任，而且，毕竟没有那么多的活供两个强健的男人做。没有了那个残忍的“鞭子手”，或者换句话说，没有了那个胁迫他们做事的混血儿，他们变得高兴起来。刚开始，他们都努力胜过对方，琐碎的事情也做得津津有味。他们那些现在正长途跋涉、身心俱疲的同伴们若是知道了，一定会瞠目结舌的。","Things prospered in the little cabin at first.The rough badinage of their comrades had made Weatherbee and Cuthfert conscious of the mutual responsibility which had devolved upon them; besides, there was not so much work after all for two healthy men.And the removal of the cruel whip-hand, or in other words the bulldozing half-breed, had brought with it a joyous reaction.At first, each strove to outdo the other, and they performed petty tasks with an unction which would have opened the eyes of their comrades who were now wearing out bodies and souls on the Long Trail."
"所有的忧虑都消除了。森林从三面围绕着他们，那是个用之不竭的堆木场。离他们的门几码远的地方，波丘派恩河静静地流淌着，在它冬天的长袍上钻个洞就能带来一股冒着泡的泉水，那水如水晶般清澈，但带着刺骨的寒意。但他们很快就连那个洞都要埋怨。那个洞会不断结起冰来，这样他们就得痛苦地花很多个小时去凿冰。这个木屋无名的建造者们把旁木延长，以支撑起屋后的储藏室。其中储藏着这群人的大量食物。食物供应没有限制，那些食物的数量是注定要以它为生的人们所需数量的三倍。但是大部分食物是用来积蓄体力和精力的，唤不醒人的味觉。诚然，这里有充足的糖可供两个普通人吃，但是这两个人吃的糖不比孩子少。他们早就发现了热水与糖巧妙融合带来的好处，浪费地把烙饼和面包皮浸泡在白色的浓糖浆里。而咖啡和茶，尤其是果干，则大大增加了糖的消耗。他们之间的第一次口角就是关于糖的问题。一对完全依赖对方的伙伴开始争吵，这真的是一件严重的事。","All care was banished.The forest, which shouldered in upon them from three sides, was an inexhaustible woodyard.A few yards from their door slept the Porcupine, and a hole through its winter robe formed a bubbling spring of water, crystal clear and painfully cold.But they soon grew to find fault with even that.The hole would persist in freezing up, and thus gave them many a miserable hour of ice-chopping.The unknown builders of the cabin had extended the side-logs so as to support a cache at the rear.In this was stored the bulk of the party’s provisions.Food there was, without stint, for three times the men who were fated to live upon it.But the most of it was of the kind which built up brawn and sinew, but did not tickle the palate.True, there was sugar in plenty for two ordinary men; but these two were little else than children.They early discovered the virtues of hot water judiciously saturated with sugar, and they prodigally swam their flapjacks and soaked their crusts in the rich, white syrup.Then coffee and tea, and especially the dried fruits, made disastrous inroads upon it.The first words they had were over the sugar question.And it is a really serious thing when two men, wholly dependent upon each other for company, begin to quarrel."
"韦瑟比喜欢公然讨论政治，而卡斯费特要么忽略这个话题，要么就说些令人吃惊的警句。他常常会剪他的息票，让国家尽量平稳运行下去。但是这个职员太愚钝，无法理解巧妙的思维方式，白白浪费了攻击别人的炮弹，这激怒了卡斯费特。他已经习惯了用他的才智去蒙蔽人们，因此失去了一个听众，这对他来说是一件很艰难的事。他自己感到愤愤不平，而且不自觉地把这些归咎到他那笨蛋同伴身上。","Weatherbee loved to discourse blatantly on politics, while Cuthfert, who had been prone to clip his coupons and let the commonwealth jog on as best it might, either ignored the subject or delivered himself of startling epigrams.But the clerk was too obtuse to appreciate the clever shaping of thought, and this waste of ammunition irritated Cuthfert.He had been used to blinding people by his brilliancy, and it worked him quite a hardship, this loss of an audience.He felt personally aggrieved and unconsciously held his mutton-head companion responsible for it."
"除了都活着，他们没有任何共同点——没有任何一点促使他们交往。韦瑟比是个职员，一生中除了当职员以外什么也不懂；卡斯费特是一个艺术家，一个业余的油画家，而且写过不少东西。一个是把自己当成绅士的下等人，而另一个是知道自己身份的绅士。从这一点来看，我们可以说，一个对真正的友好情谊没有初始直觉的人也能成为绅士。职员易受感官影响，正如另一个具有审美情趣一样。职员详细地讲述他的爱情奇遇，而那大部分都是他想象出来的。这个过度敏感的艺术家感觉这些故事就如同阴沟里袭来的阵阵臭气一样。他认为这个职员是个肮脏、没有教养的笨蛋，该和猪一起呆在粪堆中，他就这样和职员说了；而他得到的回复是，他是个软弱无能、女里女气的无赖。韦瑟比不能把自己的一生定义为“无赖”，但是生命的意义实现了，毕竟那似乎是生活的主旋律。","Save existence, they had nothing in common,—came in touch on no single point.Weatherbee was a clerk who had known naught but clerking all his life; Cuthfert was a master of arts, a dabbler in oils, and had written not a little.The one was a lower-class man who considered himself a gentleman, and the other was a gentleman who knew himself to be such.From this it may be remarked that a man can be a gentleman without possessing the first instinct of true comradeship.The clerk was as sensuous as the other was aesthetic, and his love adventures, told at great length and chiefly coined from his imagination, affected the supersensitive master of arts in the same way as so many whiffs of sewer gas.He deemed the clerk a filthy, uncultured brute, whose place was in the muck with the swine, and told him so; and he was reciprocally informed that he was a milk-and-water sissy and a cad.Weatherbee could not have defined “cad” for his life; but it satisfied its purpose, which after all seems the main point in life."
"韦瑟比每唱两个音就降一个调，他唱的是诸如《波士顿的小偷》和《帅气的木屋男孩》之类的歌曲，一唱就是几个小时，而卡斯费特气得掉泪，直到他再也忍受不了，逃到寒冷的屋外。但是他逃也逃不掉。人在严寒中呆不了多久，而小小的木屋中塞满了东西——床、炉子、桌子等等——一切都挤到了这十乘十二的空间内。一个人的存在成为了对另一个人的冒犯，他们陷入了死气沉沉的沉默中，而且随着日子一天天过去，沉默的长度和强度都在增加。尽管他们尽力在这些沉默的时刻完全忽略对方，但占上风的那个偶尔也会瞥一眼对方或者撇撇嘴。他们两个心里都生出一个很大的疑惑，就是上帝怎么就创造了对方。","Weatherbee flatted every third note and sang such songs as “The Boston Burglar” and “The Handsome Cabin Boy,” for hours at a time, while Cuthfert wept with rage, till he could stand it no longer and fled into the outer cold.But there was no escape.The intense frost could not be endured for long at a time, and the little cabin crowded them—beds, stove, table, and all—into a space of ten by twelve.The very presence of either became a personal affront to the other, and they lapsed into sullen silences which increased in length and strength as the days went by.Occasionally, the flash of an eye or the curl of a lip got the better of them, though they strove to wholly ignore each other during these mute periods.And a great wonder sprang up in the breast of each, as to how God had ever come to create the other."
"由于没有什么事做，时间对他们来说成了难以忍受的负担。这很自然地使他们变得更懒了。他们不可避免地陷入了身体乏力的状态，而这使得他们连最小的事都不愿意做。一天早晨，轮到韦瑟比给两个人做早餐时，他爬出毛毯，和着同伴的呼噜声，先点着那盏粗劣的灯，然后生了火。水壶冻得很结实，而木屋里又没有水可以拿来洗。但是他对此并不介意。在等着它融化的时候，他切了熏肉片，然后开始做面包，这是他非常讨厌干的活。卡斯费特一直半睁着眼睛，偷偷地注视着这些。结果出现了这样的场景，他们热诚地祝福彼此，而且同意从此以后各做各的饭。一周以后，卡斯费特不再洗晨浴，但是他还是很满足地吃着自己做的饭。韦瑟比咧着嘴笑。从那以后，洗浴这个愚蠢的习惯从他们的生活中消失了。","With little to do, time became an intolerable burden to them.This naturally made them still lazier.They sank into a physical lethargy which there was no escaping, and which made them rebel at the performance of the smallest chore.One morning when it was his turn to cook the common breakfast, Weatherbee rolled out of his blankets, and to the snoring of his companion, lighted first the slush-lamp and then the fire.The kettles were frozen hard, and there was no water in the cabin with which to wash.But he did not mind that.Waiting for it to thaw, he sliced the bacon and plunged into the hateful task of bread-making.Cuthfert had been slyly watching through his half-closed lids.Consequently there was a scene, in which they fervently blessed each other, and agreed, thenceforth, that each do his own cooking.A week later, Cuthfert neglected his morning ablutions, but none the less complacently ate the meal which he had cooked.Weatherbee grinned.After that the foolish custom of washing passed out of their lives."
"随着糖和其他为数不多的奢侈品的减少，他们开始担心得不到自己应有的那一份，为了避免东西被抢，他们开始拼命地吃。这些奢侈品在这两个贪食者的争夺战中遭了秧，而这两个人也吃了苦头。在缺少新鲜蔬菜、缺乏锻炼的情况下，他们的血液质量下降，他们的身上生出一种令人厌恶的紫色皮疹。但他们却对这样的警告毫不在意。接下来，他们的肌肉和关节开始肿胀，肉开始变黑，而他们的嘴、牙龈和嘴唇呈现出浓浓的奶油的颜色。他们没有因为遭受痛苦而联合起来，相反，他们幸灾乐祸地看着对方身上坏血病的各种症状。","As the sugar-pile and other little luxuries dwindled, they began to be afraid they were not getting their proper shares, and in order that they might not be robbed, they fell to gorging themselves.The luxuries suffered in this gluttonous contest, as did also the men.In the absence of fresh vegetables and exercise, their blood became impoverished, and a loathsome, purplish rash crept over their bodies.Yet they refused to heed the warning.Next, their muscles and joints began to swell, the flesh turning black, while their mouths, gums, and lips took on the color of rich cream.Instead of being drawn together by their misery, each gloated over the other’s symptoms as the scurvy took its course."
"他们失去了对个人形象的全部关注，而且也没有了基本的体面。木屋变成了猪圈，他们从来没有整理过床铺，也从来没有把新鲜松树枝放到下面去。然而他们却不能如愿以偿一直躺在毛毯里，因为严寒不可阻挡，而火膛要烧很多燃料。他们头上和脸上的毛发长长了，并且蓬乱不堪，身上的衣服连拾荒的人见了都会感到恶心。但是他们不介意。他们病了，但是这里没有人看病；况且，走来走去也很痛苦。","They lost all regard for personal appearance, and for that matter, common decency.The cabin became a pigpen, and never once were the beds made or fresh pine boughs laid underneath.Yet they could not keep to their blankets, as they would have wished; for the frost was inexorable, and the fire box consumed much fuel.The hair of their heads and faces grew long and shaggy, while their garments would have disgusted a ragpicker.But they did not care.They were sick, and there was no one to see; besides, it was very painful to move about."
"除此之外，又有了新的麻烦——对北方的恐惧。这种恐惧是极度的寒冷和极度的沉默共同造成的，它出现在十二月的黑暗中，那时太阳永远地没入了南地平线以下。这种恐惧对本性不同的两个人产生了不同的影响。韦瑟比成为了极端迷信的俘虏，他竭尽全力去复活那些在被遗忘的坟墓里沉睡的灵魂。这是一件吸引人的事，在他的梦中，那些灵魂从寒冷中走到他面前，依偎在他的毛毯里，给他讲述死之前的辛劳和麻烦。当他们越来越靠近他，还把冰冻的四肢缠绕在他的身上时，这样冷而黏湿的触觉让他缩了回来，而当他们在他的耳边低语将要发生的事时，木屋内就充满他惊恐的尖叫声。卡斯费特不理解——因为他们不再说话，而当他被惊醒时，总是会去抓他的左轮手枪。然后他会在床上坐起来，紧张地颤抖着，用枪瞄准那个毫无意识的、做梦的人。卡斯费特认为这个人快疯了，也开始为自己的生命担忧。","To all this was added a new trouble,—the Fear of the North.This Fear was the joint child of the Great Cold and the Great Silence, and was born in the darkness of December, when the sun dipped below the southern horizon for good.It affected them according to their natures.Weatherbee fell prey to the grosser superstitions, and did his best to resurrect the spirits which slept in the forgotten graves.It was a fascinating thing, and in his dreams they came to him from out of the cold, and snuggled into his blankets, and told him of their toils and troubles ere they died.He shrank away from the clammy contact as they drew closer and twined their frozen limbs about him, and when they whispered in his ear of things to come, the cabin rang with his frightened shrieks.Cuthfert did not understand,—for they no longer spoke,—and when thus awakened he invariably grabbed for his revolver.Then he would sit up in bed, shivering nervously, with the weapon trained on the unconscious dreamer.Cuthfert deemed the man going mad, and so came to fear for his life."
"他自己的病以一种不太具体的形式呈现出来。那个用一根根木头搭起了木屋的神秘手艺人，把一个风向标钉到了木屋的脊梁上。卡斯费特注意到它总是指着南方，有一天，他被风向标顽固的意志惹恼了，把它转向了东边。他急切地注视着，但是没有喘一口气去干扰它。然后他使风向标朝北，发誓在风吹动它之前再也不碰它。但是空气出奇地平静，让他害怕，他经常半夜起来看那个风向标是否转向了——哪怕十度的转角就能让他满意了。但是没有，它平稳地立在上方，如命运一般不可改变。他想入非非，直到它成为他的一个物神。有时他沿着它指引的道路穿过那片阴郁的领土，允许自己的灵魂充满了那种恐惧。他总是想着看不到的和未知的东西，直到那永远的负担好像要压垮他。北地的任何东西都有压垮人的作用——没有生命，也没有动静，一片黑暗，压抑的土地上是无尽的静谧，那种恐怖的沉默让每一个心跳的回音成了渎神的行为，那庄重的森林好像守护着一个令人敬畏的、无法形容的东西，这个东西用语言或者思想都无法界定。","His own malady assumed a less concrete form.The mysterious artisan who had laid the cabin, log by log, had pegged a wind-vane to the ridge-pole.Cuthfert noticed it always pointed south, and one day, irritated by its steadfastness of purpose, he turned it toward the east.He watched eagerly, but never a breath came by to disturb it.Then he turned the vane to the north, swearing never again to touch it till the wind did blow.But the air frightened him with its unearthly calm, and he often rose in the middle of the night to see if the vane had veered,—ten degrees would have satisfied him.But no, it poised above him as unchangeable as fate.His imagination ran riot, till it became to him a fetich.Sometimes he followed the path it pointed across the dismal dominions, and allowed his soul to become saturated with the Fear.He dwelt upon the unseen and the unknown till the burden of eternity appeared to be crushing him.Everything in the Northland had that crushing effect,—the absence of life and motion; the darkness; the infinite peace of the brooding land; the ghastly silence, which made the echo of each heart-beat a sacrilege; the solemn forest which seemed to guard an awful, inexpressible something, which neither word nor thought could compass."
"他最近才离开的那个世界，有着忙碌国民和伟大事业的世界，似乎很遥远了。记忆中的往事偶尔会闯进来——回忆起市场、美术馆和拥挤的大街，回忆起晚礼服和社交集会，回忆起他认识的好男人和可爱女人，但是这些只是他以前生活的模糊记忆，那是很多个世纪之前在别的星球上的生活。这种幻觉才是现实。站在风向标下面，他的眼睛紧盯着极地的天空，他不能使自己意识到南方真的存在，也意识不到此时那里充满着生命和活动的喧嚣。这里没有南方，没有女人生出来的男人，也没有婚姻中的付出和索取。在荒凉的天际外延伸着巨大的孤独，而在这些孤独之外是更大的孤独。这里没有阳光照耀的土地，没有弥漫着的浓郁花香。这些东西只是极乐世界的旧梦。西方的阳光之地和东方的香料之地，生机盎然的世外桃源和让人乐而忘忧的极乐岛，哈！哈！他的笑声打破了孤寂，而那异常的声音吓了他一跳。这里没有太阳。这就是世界，死寂、阴冷、黑暗，而他是这个世界上唯一的公民。韦瑟比？这时候韦瑟比已经不算是人了。他是个卑下而凶残的东西，是个可恶的幽灵，纠缠了他无数年，是某种已被遗忘的罪名带来的惩罚。","The world he had so recently left, with its busy nations and great enterprises, seemed very far away.Recollections occasionally obtruded,—recollections of marts and galleries and crowded thoroughfares, of evening dress and social functions, of good men and dear women he had known,—but they were dim memories of a life he had lived long centuries agone, on some other planet.This phantasm was the Reality.Standing beneath the wind-vane, his eyes fixed on the polar skies, he could not bring himself to realize that the Southland really existed, that at that very moment it was a-roar with life and action.There was no Southland, no men being born of women, no giving and taking in marriage.Beyond his bleak sky-line there stretched vast solitudes, and beyond these still vaster solitudes.There were no lands of sunshine, heavy with the perfume of flowers.Such things were only old dreams of paradise.The sunlands of the West and the spicelands of the East, the smiling Arcadias and blissful Islands of the Blest,—ha! ha!His laughter split the void and shocked him with its unwonted sound.There was no sun.This was the Universe, dead and cold and dark, and he its only citizen.Weatherbee?At such moments Weatherbee did not count.He was a Caliban, a monstrous phantom, fettered to him for untold ages, the penalty of some forgotten crime."
"他和死神活在死人中间，因感觉到自己的卑微而变得衰弱，因为被动地掌控这个使人昏睡的时代而被压垮了。所有东西如此庞大，令他惊恐。任何事物都带有被放大的色彩，除了他自己——风和其他运动完全停止，被冰雪覆盖的荒野一望无垠，天空高不可测，寂静深不可知。那个风向标，它能动一动也好啊。雷电来临，或者森林突然起火都行。或是天空像卷轴一样卷起来，世界末日带来巨响——任何东西，任何东西都行！但是没有，什么也没动。孤寂涌来，对北方的恐惧把冰冷的手指放在他的心上。","He lived with Death among the dead, emasculated by the sense of his own insignificance, crushed by the passive mastery of the slumbering ages.The magnitude of all things appalled him.Everything partook of the superlative save himself,—the perfect cessation of wind and motion, the immensity of the snow-covered wilderness, the height of the sky and the depth of the silence.That wind-vane,—if it would only move.If a thunderbolt would fall, or the forest flare up in flame.The rolling up of the heavens as a scroll, the crash of Doom—anything, anything!But no, nothing moved; the Silence crowded in, and the Fear of the North laid icy fingers on his heart."
"有一次，他像另外一个鲁宾逊一样，在河边偶然看到一行足迹，那是一只雪兔留在易碎的积雪表面的模糊花纹。这是一个启示。在北地有生命存在。他跟着它，看着它，为此沾沾自喜。他忘记了自己肿胀的肌肉，走过厚厚的积雪，满怀期望，欣喜不已。森林吞没了他，正午短暂的微明消失了。但是他继续搜索着，直到筋疲力尽的身体让他无助地躺在了雪地里。在那里他抱怨并诅咒自己的愚蠢，他知道那足迹是他大脑的幻觉。那天深夜，他拖着身子爬进木屋，他的脸冻僵了，而且双脚还有一种奇怪的麻木感。韦瑟比恶毒地呲牙笑着，但并没有给卡斯费特提供任何帮助。他把针扎到了脚趾里，在火炉边解冻后把它们拔了出来。一周以后形成了坏疽。","Once, like another Crusoe, by the edge of the river he came upon a track,—the faint tracery of a snowshoe rabbit on the delicate snow-crust.It was a revelation.There was life in the Northland.He would follow it, look upon it, gloat over it.He forgot his swollen muscles, plunging through the deep snow in an ecstasy of anticipation.The forest swallowed him up, and the brief midday twilight vanished; but he pursued his quest till exhausted nature asserted itself and laid him helpless in the snow.There he groaned and cursed his folly, and knew the track to be the fancy of his brain; and late that night he dragged himself into the cabin on hands and knees, his cheeks frozen and a strange numbness about his feet.Weatherbee grinned malevolently, but made no offer to help him.He thrust needles into his toes and thawed them out by the stove.A week later mortification set in."
"但是那个职员有他自己的麻烦。现在那些死人更加频繁地从他们坟墓里出来，而且很少离开他，无论他是醒着还是睡着。他开始等待并害怕他们的到来，路过那一对石冢时就没有一次不打颤的。一天晚上，他们在他睡觉时来到他身边，然后带着他去完成一个指定的任务。　　　　他吓坏了，话都说不出来，醒来时发现自己在石堆中，就疯狂地逃回木屋。但是他已经躺在那里有一段时间了，因为他的双脚和脸颊都冻僵了。","But the clerk had his own troubles.The dead men came out of their graves more frequently now, and rarely left him, waking or sleeping.He grew to wait and dread their coming, never passing the twin cairns without a shudder.One night they came to him in his sleep and led him forth to an appointed task.Frightened into inarticulate horror, he awoke between the heaps of stones and fled wildly to the cabin.But he had lain there for some time, for his feet and cheeks were also frozen."
"有时他因为他们持续不断的到来变得慌乱不安，绕着木屋跳舞，拿着一把斧头在空气中乱砍，打碎所有够得着的东西。遇到这种可怕的情况时，卡斯费特蜷缩到他的毛毯中，然后跟着这个疯子转，手里拿着一把扳起扳机的左轮手枪，准备在他过于靠近自己时开枪。但是，有一次这个职员发作后清醒过来时，注意到枪口对准他。他起了疑心，而从那时起，他也开始为自己的生命担忧。从那以后他们密切注视着彼此，一旦其中一人从另外一人的背后经过，另外那个人就会惊恐万分地转过身。这种焦虑成为一种狂热，即使在他们睡觉时也控制着他们。对彼此的恐惧使他们心照不宣地让油灯亮一晚上，而且在睡觉之前保证有充足的咸猪肉油脂。其中一方再小的动静都足以唤醒另一方，无数次的寂静中，他们眼神相撞，身体在毛毯下颤抖，手指按着扳机。由于对北方的恐惧、精神上的紧张，还有疾病的侵害，他们已经一点也没有人的样子，而是如野兽一般，惊恐而绝望。作为冻伤的后果，他们的脸颊和鼻子已经变成了黑色。他们冻伤的脚趾已经开始在第一和第二个关节处脱落。每一个动作都会带来痛苦，但是火膛却是不知足的，总需要填燃料，像要从他们痛苦的身体里榨取折磨人的赎金。日复一日，火膛需要食物——名副其实的一磅肉，他们拖着身子到森林里跪着砍柴。有一次，他们正这样爬着找干柴枝，不知道对方从相反的方向进入了同一个灌木丛。突然，在毫无防备的情况下，两个差不多的骷髅迎面相遇了。苦难已经改变了他们很多，以至于辨认出对方是不可能的了。他们跳起来，恐惧地尖叫着，然后拖着损伤的残肢飞快逃跑了；在木屋门口他们倒下了，像魔鬼一样狂抓乱挠，直到他们发现这是误会。","Sometimes he became frantic at their insistent presence, and danced about the cabin, cutting the empty air with an axe, and smashing everything within reach.During these ghostly encounters, Cuthfert huddled into his blankets and followed the madman about with a cocked revolver, ready to shoot him if he came too near.But, recovering from one of these spells, the clerk noticed the weapon trained upon him.His suspicions were aroused, and thenceforth he, too, lived in fear of his life.They watched each other closely after that, and faced about in startled fright whenever either passed behind the other’s back.This apprehensiveness became a mania which controlled them even in their sleep.Through mutual fear they tacitly let the slush-lamp burn all night, and saw to a plentiful supply of bacon-grease before retiring.The slightest movement on the part of one was sufficient to arouse the other, and many a still watch their gazes countered as they shook beneath their blankets with fingers on the trigger-guards.What with the Fear of the North, the mental strain, and the ravages of the disease, they lost all semblance of humanity, taking on the appearance of wild beasts, hunted and desperate.Their cheeks and noses, as an aftermath of the freezing, had turned black.Their frozen toes had begun to drop away at the first and second joints.Every movement brought pain, but the fire box was insatiable, wringing a ransom of torture from their miserable bodies.Day in, day out, it demanded its food,—a veritable pound of flesh,—and they dragged themselves into the forest to chop wood on their knees.Once, crawling thus in search of dry sticks, unknown to each other they entered a thicket from opposite sides.Suddenly, without warning, two peering death’s-heads confronted each other.Suffering had so transformed them that recognition was impossible.They sprang to their feet, shrieking with terror, and dashed away on their mangled stumps; and falling at the cabin door, they clawed and scratched like demons till they discovered their mistake."
"偶尔他们情况正常，在一次神志清醒的间隙，他们把糖——争论的主要话题——平均分了。他们看守着各自的麻袋，眼睛里充满嫉妒，麻袋放在储藏室；因为只剩下几杯的量了，他们对彼此完全失去了信任。但是有一天，卡斯费特犯了一个错误。他基本上不怎么能动了，受着病痛，还头昏眼瞎的。他爬进储藏室，把糖罐拿在手里，错把韦瑟比的麻袋当成了自己的。","Occasionally they lapsed normal, and during one of these sane intervals, the chief bone of contention, the sugar, had been divided equally between them.They guarded their separate sacks, stored up in the cache, with jealous eyes; for there were but a few cupfuls left, and they were totally devoid of faith in each other.But one day Cuthfert made a mistake.Hardly able to move, sick with pain, with his head swimming and eyes blinded, he crept into the cache, sugar canister in hand, and mistook Weatherbee’s sack for his own."
"这事发生时，一月份刚过了没几天。自从太阳过了南回归线，有时候就会在正午时将耀眼的黄色光线照射到北地的天空中。他拿错糖袋的第二天，卡斯费特发现自己感觉好些了，无论是身体上还是精神上。随着正午的临近，天亮起来，他拖着身体出去，尽情享受短暂的光辉，这光辉对他来说是太阳未来动向的预兆。韦瑟比也感觉稍微好些了，他缓慢地走出来，站在卡斯费特旁边。在静止不动的风向标下，他们支撑着身体呆在雪地里，等待着。","January had been born but a few days when this occurred.The sun had some time since passed its lowest southern declination, and at meridian now threw flaunting streaks of yellow light upon the northern sky.On the day following his mistake with the sugar-bag, Cuthfert found himself feeling better, both in body and in spirit.As noontime drew near and the day brightened, he dragged himself outside to feast on the evanescent glow, which was to him an earnest of the sun’s future intentions.Weatherbee was also feeling somewhat better, and crawled out beside him.They propped themselves in the snow beneath the moveless wind-vane, and waited."
"死一般的寂静环绕着他们。在其他地方，当大自然陷入这种气氛时，就有一丝被抑制住的期待，等待着某个微弱的声音占据那断断续续的压力。但是在北方却不是。这两个人好像已经在可怕的静寂中生活了千万年。他们记不起过去的歌，也想象不出未来的歌。这种异常的寂静一直持续着，这是一种永恒的平静的沉默。","The stillness of death was about them.In other climes, when nature falls into such moods, there is a subdued air of expectancy, a waiting for some small voice to take up the broken strain.Not so in the North.The two men had lived seeming aeons in this ghostly peace.They could remember no song of the past; they could conjure no song of the future.This unearthly calm had always been,—the tranquil silence of eternity."
"他们的眼睛紧盯着北方。他们看不到，在他们的背后，在向南延伸的高山背后，太阳朝另外一片天的最高点移去，而不是他们的这片天。他们是天上这幅巨型油画仅有的观赏者，他们注视着不真实的曙光缓慢地增强。微弱的光焰开始发出柔和的光，闷燃着。它的光在增强，微红的黄色、紫色和金黄色这几种颜色变换着。它变得如此明亮，以至于卡斯费特以为太阳肯定就在它的后面——这是一个奇迹，太阳从北方升起来了！突然间，没有任何预兆也没有任何衰退的迹象，这幅油画被擦拭干净了。天空中没有了色彩。白天的光线已经消失了。他们喘息着，几乎要抽泣起来。但是看哪！空气闪着光，掺杂着闪耀的霜粒；在北面，风向标的轮廓在雪中模糊不清。一片阴影！一片阴影！这确实是正午。他们急忙把头扭向南面。一道金边从积雪覆盖的山肩上慢慢显露出来，朝他们微笑片刻，然后又落到视线外了。","Their eyes were fixed upon the north.Unseen, behind their backs, behind the towering mountains to the south, the sun swept toward the zenith of another sky than theirs.Sole spectators of the mighty canvas, they watched the false dawn slowly grow.A faint flame began to glow and smoulder.It deepened in intensity, ringing the changes of reddish-yellow, purple, and saffron.So bright did it become that Cuthfert thought the sun must surely be behind it,—a miracle, the sun rising in the north!Suddenly, without warning and without fading, the canvas was swept clean.There was no color in the sky.The light had gone out of the day.They caught their breaths in half-sobs.But lo! the air was a-glint with particles of scintillating frost, and there, to the north, the wind-vane lay in vague outline on the snow.A shadow!A shadow!It was exactly midday.They jerked their heads hurriedly to the south.A golden rim peeped over the mountain’s snowy shoulder, smiled upon them an instant, then dipped from sight again."
"在寻找对方时，他们眼中含着泪水。他们突然有一种奇怪的被软化的感觉。他们感觉无可抗拒地被对方吸引。太阳又回来了。明天，后天，以及接下来的日子里，太阳都会和他们在一起。每次来临它呆的时间都会长一些，终有一天，它将昼夜停留在他们的天空，再也不会落到天际以下。这里将不再有黑夜。冰封的冬天将会结束，风会吹来，而森林会回应，大地将会沐浴在幸福的阳光下，万物复苏。他们将手牵手，抛掉这令人恐惧的噩梦，返回南部。他们盲目地蹒跚前行，他们的手碰到一起——他们的可怜的残手，戴着连指手套，已经肿胀变形了。","There were tears in their eyes as they sought each other.A strange softening came over them.They felt irresistibly drawn toward each other.The sun was coming back again.It would be with them to-morrow, and the next day, and the next.And it would stay longer every visit, and a time would come when it would ride their heaven day and night, never once dropping below the sky-line.There would be no night.The ice-locked winter would be broken; the winds would blow and the forests answer; the land would bathe in the blessed sunshine, and life renew.Hand in hand, they would quit this horrid dream and journey back to the Southland.They lurched blindly forward, and their hands met,—their poor maimed hands, swollen and distorted beneath their mittens."
"然而承诺注定无法实现。北方就是北方，人们被奇怪的规则弄得心力交瘁，这些规则对于其他那些没有远到他乡的人来说，是无法理解的。","But the promise was destined to remain unfulfilled.The Northland is the Northland, and men work out their souls by strange rules, which other men, who have not journeyed into far countries, cannot come to understand."
"一个小时以后，卡斯费特把一盘面包放进了烤箱，然后开始想他回去以后外科医生会怎么治他的脚。现在家似乎离他们不是很远了。韦瑟比正在储藏室到处翻。突然，他说了一连串的骂人的话，而这叫骂声又突然停止了，让人很吃惊。另外一个人抢了他的糖袋。虽然如此，要是那两个死人不从石头底下出来，并且使那些激烈的言辞安静地呆在在嗓子里，发生的事情也许就不同了。他们轻轻地把他从储物室里带出来，他忘记了要把门关上。绝好的时机到了，他们曾在他梦里悄声告诉他的事情就要发生了。他们慢慢地指引着他，非常慢，把他领到了木柴堆旁，他们把斧头放到了他的手里。然后他们帮助他推开木屋的门，他确信他们在后面关上了门，至少他听到门砰的一声，门闩迅速地落下来。他知道他们就在外面等着，等着他完成他的任务。","An hour later, Cuthfert put a pan of bread into the oven, and fell to speculating on what the surgeons could do with his feet when he got back.Home did not seem so very far away now.Weatherbee was rummaging in the cache.Of a sudden, he raised a whirlwind of blasphemy, which in turn ceased with startling abruptness.The other man had robbed his sugar-sack.Still, things might have happened differently, had not the two dead men come out from under the stones and hushed the hot words in his throat.They led him quite gently from the cache, which he forgot to close.That consummation was reached; that something they had whispered to him in his dreams was about to happen.They guided him gently, very gently, to the woodpile, where they put the axe in his hands.Then they helped him shove open the cabin door, and he felt sure they shut it after him,—at least he heard it slam and the latch fall sharply into place.And he knew they were waiting just without, waiting for him to do his task."
"“卡特！我说呀，卡特！”","“Carter!I say, Carter!”"
"珀西·卡斯费特被职员的神情吓了一跳，他匆忙把桌子放在两个人中间。","Percy Cuthfert was frightened at the look on the clerk’s face, and he made haste to put the table between them."
"卡特·韦瑟比追上去，不慌不忙，也毫无热情。他的脸上既没有怜悯也没有激情，而是坚忍的、冷漠的表情，那是有某项工作要做并有条理地去做的人才有的。","Carter Weatherbee followed, without haste and without enthusiasm.There was neither pity nor passion in his face, but rather the patient, stolid look of one who has certain work to do and goes about it methodically."
"“我说呀，这是出什么事啦？”","“I say, what’s the matter?”"
"职员闪回去，阻断他后退到门口的路，但是他没有开口说话。","The clerk dodged back, cutting off his retreat to the door, but never opening his mouth."
"“我说呀，卡特，我说，让我们谈谈。你是个好人。”","“I say, Carter, I say; let’s talk.There’s a good chap.”"
"艺术家正在飞快地思考着，这时候，他灵巧地侧身跳到床上，那儿放着他的《史密斯和韦森》。他的眼睛注视着那个疯子，他在床上向后滚着，同时抓起手枪。","The master of arts was thinking rapidly, now, shaping a skillful flank movement on the bed where his Smith&Wesson lay.Keeping his eyes on the madman, he rolled backward on the bunk, at the same time clutching the pistol."
"“卡特！”","“Carter!”"
"粉末飞了韦瑟比一脸，但是他还摆动着武器向前跃去。斧头深深地砍在了卡斯费特脊柱的底部，珀西·卡斯费特感觉到他下肢的全部意识离开了他。然后那个职员重重地将他扑倒，用虚弱的手指掐着他的脖子。被斧头猛砍了一下后，卡斯费特丢掉了他的手枪，喘气放松的时候，他在毛毯中漫无目的地摸索着找他的枪。然后他想起来一件事。他把一只手移到了职员腰带上的鞘刀上；最后扭抱在一起时，他们两个人挨得很近。","The powder flashed full in Weatherbee’s face, but he swung his weapon and leaped forward.The axe bit deeply at the base of the spine, and Percy Cuthfert felt all consciousness of his lower limbs leave him.Then the clerk fell heavily upon him, clutching him by the throat with feeble fingers.The sharp bite of the axe had caused Cuthfert to drop the pistol, and as his lungs panted for release, he fumbled aimlessly for it among the blankets.Then he remembered.He slid a hand up the clerk’s belt to the sheath-knife; and they drew very close to each other in that last clinch."
"珀西·卡斯费特感觉力量离开了他。他的下半身没有用了。韦瑟比迟钝的身体重重地压着他，就像一只掉进陷阱的熊一样压着他，并把他固定在那里。这个木屋开始充满着一种熟悉的味道，他知道面包要糊了。然而那又有什么关系呢？他再也不需要它了。六杯糖都在储藏室里，要是他能预见这些，那过去的这些天里他就不会那么省了。风向标会动吗？它现在可能正转向呢。为什么不呢？他今天不是没有见到太阳吗？他应该出去看看。不，现在他不可能动了。他没想到职员有这么重。","Percy Cuthfert felt his strength leave him.The lower portion of his body was useless.The inert weight of Weatherbee crushed him,—crushed him and pinned him there like a bear under a trap.The cabin became filled with a familiar odor, and he knew the bread to be burning.Yet what did it matter?He would never need it.And there were all of six cupfuls of sugar in the cache,—if he had foreseen this he would not have been so saving the last several days.Would the wind-vane ever move?It might even be veering now.Why not?Had he not seen the sun to-day?He would go and see.No; it was impossible to move.He had not thought the clerk so heavy a man."
"木屋冷得真快啊！火一定是灭了。寒气逼进来。温度肯定已经零下了，冰正慢慢爬到门里面来。他看不到它，但是凭借过去的经验，他可以根据木屋里的温度来估计它的进程。那个较低的合页在这之前肯定是白色的。这个故事将会传到世界上吗？他的朋友们将会怎么想？他们可能是喝咖啡时读到的，最有可能的是，他们在俱乐部谈论这件事。他可以清楚地看到他们。“可怜的老卡斯费特，”他们小声说道，“毕竟不算是个坏家伙。”听了他们的颂词，他笑了笑，继续往下寻找蒸气浴室。街道上依旧是原来那群人。奇怪，他们没有注意到他的麋鹿皮软帮鞋和那双破旧的德国袜子。他要乘坐出租马车。洗过澡，刮刮胡子应该不错。不，他要先吃饭。牛排，马铃薯，还有些绿色的东西——它们是多么新鲜啊！那是什么？几方格的蜂蜜，就像流动的液体琥珀。但是他们为什么带来这么多呢？哈！哈！他永远也吃不完。闪闪发光！当然是这样。他把脚放在箱子上。擦鞋的人抬头好奇地看着他，他这才记起自己穿着麋鹿皮软帮鞋，于是匆忙离开了。","How quickly the cabin cooled!The fire must be out.The cold was forcing in.It must be below zero already, and the ice creeping up the inside of the door.He could not see it, but his past experience enabled him to gauge its progress by the cabin’s temperature.The lower hinge must be white ere now.Would the tale of this ever reach the world?How would his friends take it?They would read it over their coffee, most likely, and talk it over at the clubs.He could see them very clearly.“Poor Old Cuthfert,” they murmured; “not such a bad sort of a chap, after all.”He smiled at their eulogies, and passed on in search of a Turkish bath.It was the same old crowd upon the streets.Strange, they did not notice his moosehide moccasins and tattered German socks!He would take a cab.And after the bath a shave would not be bad.No; he would eat first.Steak, and potatoes, and green things,—how fresh it all was!And what was that?Squares of honey, streaming liquid amber!But why did they bring so much?Ha! ha! he could never eat it all.Shine!Why certainly.He put his foot on the box.The bootblack looked curiously up at him, and he remembered his moosehide moccasins and went away hastily."
"留神听！风向标一定是在旋转。不，那只不过是他耳中的耳鸣声。就是那样，只是耳鸣。冰现在肯定已经盖过门闩了。很有可能已经盖住了上面的合页。屋顶杆子上的裂缝中长着苔藓，杆子之间开始出现小霜点。它们长得如此之慢。不，不是那么慢。出现一个新的，又有一个。两个，三个，四个，它们来得太快，都数不过来了。有两个正在一起出现。那边，第三个加入了它们。哎呀，已经没有点了。它们聚在一起，形成了一片。","Hark!The wind-vane must be surely spinning.No; a mere singing in his ears.That was all,—a mere singing.The ice must have passed the latch by now.More likely the upper hinge was covered.Between the moss-chinked roof-poles, little points of frost began to appear.How slowly they grew!No; not so slowly.There was a new one, and there another.Two—three—four; they were coming too fast to count.There were two growing together.And there, a third had joined them.Why, there were no more spots.They had run together and formed a sheet."
"是啊，他本该有个同伴的。如果加布里埃尔打破过北方的寂静，他们就会站在一起了，手牵手，站在巨大的白色君主山前。上帝会评判他们的，上帝会评判他们！","Well, he would have company.If Gabriel ever broke the silence of the North, they would stand together, hand in hand, before the great White Throne.And God would judge them, God would judge them!"
"然后珀西·卡斯费特闭上眼睛睡着了。","Then Percy Cuthfert closed his eyes and dropped off to sleep."
