"风险家","The Venturers"
"作者：欧·亨利","by O. Henry"
"如果非得如此，那就让这短篇小说在“毫无逻辑性可言”蜿蜒而去的铁轨上飞驰而失事吧，首先你得在“存在的理由”观景车里呆上那么一会儿。不会很长时间，只要欣赏一篇短文的时间就够了——我们称这篇散文为：《附近所闻》。","Let the story wreck itself on the spreading rails of the Non Sequitur Limited, if it will; first you must take your seat in the observation car “Raison d’être” for one moment.It is for no longer than to consider a brief essay on the subject—let us call it: “What’s Around the Corner.”"
"世界上有两种人：一种是穿着橡胶套鞋支付人头税的人，另一种是发现新大陆的人。然而迄今为止仍没有新的大陆被发现；但是等到套鞋过时、人头税发展成为个人所得税的时候，另外一半人将使火星上的运河与镭铁轨保持平行。","Omne mundus in duas partes divisum est—men who wear rubbers and pay poll-taxes, and men who discover new continents.There are no more continents to discover; but by the time overshoes are out of date and the poll has developed into an income tax, the other half will be paralleling the canals of Mars with radium railways."
"运气、机遇和冒险在字典中是同义词。但对于有学问的人来说，每个词又有着不同的意义。运气是值得夺取的嘉奖。","Fortune, Chance, and Adventure are given as synonymous in the dictionaries.To the knowing each has a different meaning.Fortune is a prize to be won."
"机遇是可能潜藏在路边阴暗处的东西。运气有着光芒四射且诱人的面孔；冒险有着激动不已且英勇的面孔。机遇的面孔是漂亮的——因朦胧和梦幻而显得完美——早餐时，当我们对着牛排和烤面包发牢骚时，我们可以在茶杯里看到它。","Chance is what may lurk in the shadows at the roadside.The face of Fortune is radiant and alluring; that of Adventure is flushed and heroic.The face of Chance is the beautiful countenance—perfect because vague and dream-born—that we see in our tea-cups at breakfast while we growl over our chops and toast."
"所谓的风险家就是在通往运气的大道上一直留心路边的矮树篱、果园和牧场的人。这就是他和冒险家的区别之所在。偷吃禁果是风险家所创的最佳纪录。而试图证明此事确实发生过则是冒险界的最高成就。成为两者任意一种都会搅乱天地万物的宇宙起源论。因此，作为能在地址录上找到姓名的普通老百姓，我们不妨点燃烟斗，训斥孩子和小猫，坐在凉爽的窗下的柳枝摇椅上，在闪烁的煤油灯下仔细审视这篇关于两个现代人寻找机遇的小故事吧。","The Venturer is one who keeps his eye on the hedgerows and wayside groves and meadows while he travels the road to Fortune.That is the difference between him and the Adventurer.Eating the forbidden fruit was the best record ever made by a Venturer.Trying to prove that it happened is the highest work of the Adventuresome.To be either is disturbing to the cosmogony of creation.So, as bracket-sawed and city-directoried citizens, let us light our pipes, chide the children and the cat, arrange ourselves in the willow rocker under the flickering gas jet at the coolest window and scan this little tale of two modern followers of Chance."
"“你听说过那个西部人的故事吗？”当你进入保厄坦俱乐部时，比林格在你左边的深色栎木质的小屋子里问道。","“Did you ever hear that story about the man from the West?” asked Billinger, in the little dark-oak room to your left as you penetrate the interior of the Powhatan Club."
"“那是当然的啦。”约翰·雷金纳德·福斯特说完，便起身准备离开房间。","“Doubtless,” said John Reginald Forster, rising and leaving the room."
"福斯特从衣帽间的服务员手里拿了他的草帽（在这篇小说出版之前，这种草帽可能还很流行，也可能早已过时了），然后就消失了（正如哈姆雷特所说）。比林格已经习惯他的小说备受打击，他不会在意的。福斯特现在心情很好，不愿在任何一个地方呆太长时间。一个人如果想拥有好心情，他的观点必须得到他人的证实，而且别人的心情必须跟他的心情相似。（我本来是想写“某人”，但是有一次，一个男孩发了份电报告诉我，如果我使用复合词的话可以为自己省下一些钱。如果我是在写稿子，那最好是多几个字了。）","Forster got his straw hat (straws will be in and maybe out again long before this is printed) from the checkroom boy, and walked out of the air (as Hamlet says).Billinger was used to having his stories insulted and would not mind.Forster was in his favorite mood and wanted to go away from anywhere.A man, in order to get on good terms with himself, must have his opinions corroborated and his moods matched by some one else.(I had written that “somebody”; but an A. D. T. boy who once took a telegram for me pointed out that I could save money by using the compound word.This is a vice versa case.)"
"福斯特最好的心情就是当他迫切想要成为机遇的追随者。他生性爱冒风险，但是习俗、出身、传统和曼哈顿部落逐渐萎缩的影响力使他不能享有所有的特权。他几乎周游了所有的大街小巷，据说这些街巷可以消除生活的枯燥和单调。但是丝毫不见效。因为他知道在每个街道的尽头都会发现什么。根据多年的经验和逻辑，他几乎清楚地知道脱离惯常生活会是什么后果。他发现他圈子里的音乐嫁接到生活的主旋律后，产生的变调也依旧令人丧气且千篇一律。他不了解，即使地球变成圆的，而现在这个圆又变方了，也只有在《附近所闻》里才能找到真正的趣味。","Forster’s favorite mood was that of greatly desiring to be a follower of Chance.He was a Venturer by nature, but convention, birth, tradition and the narrowing influences of the tribe of Manhattan had denied him full privilege.He had trodden all the main-traveled thoroughfares and many of the side roads that are supposed to relieve the tedium of life.But none had sufficed.The reason was that he knew what was to be found at the end of every street.He knew from experience and logic almost precisely to what end each digression from routine must lead.He found a depressing monotony in all the variations that the music of his sphere had grafted upon the tune of life.He had not learned that, although the world was made round, the circle has been squared, and that it’s true interest is to be in “What’s Around the Corner.”"
"福斯特离开了保厄坦，漫无目的地走着，既不费心判断也不在意自己走在哪条街上。如果可能的话他倒情愿迷路，但是对此他是不抱任何希望了。在大城市里，冒险和运气无处不在，召之即来；而机遇却有着东方意蕴。她是一个坐在轿子里受特殊交通卫队保护的蒙面夫人。不管是在商业区还是在住宅区，你都很少有机会看到她。","Forster walked abroad aimlessly from the Powhatan, trying not to tax either his judgment or his desire as to what streets he traveled.He would have been glad to lose his way if it were possible; but he had no hope of that.Adventure and Fortune move at your beck and call in the Greater City; but Chance is oriental.She is a veiled lady in a sedan chair, protected by a special traffic squad of dragonians.Crosstown, uptown, and downtown you may move without seeing her."
"一小时的闲逛之后，福斯特站在宽阔平坦的大街角落里，闷闷不乐地看着虽不显眼却灯光明亮、别致的老饭店。要在这样一家毫无冒险意义可言的饭店用餐使他极为郁闷，但他又不得不用餐。这是他喜欢的大旅社之一，因为这家饭店的环境相当安静，服务效率相当高，餐点也十分精致可口，用这家“无与伦比”的菜肴裹腹使他感到遗憾。连那里的音乐甚至都是一成不变的。","At the end of an hour’s stroll, Forster stood on a corner of a broad, smooth avenue, looking disconsolately across it at a picturesque old hotel softly but brilliantly lit.Disconsolately, because he knew that he must dine; and dining in that hotel was no venture.It was one of his favorite caravansaries, and so silent and swift would be the service and so delicately choice the food, that he regretted the hunger that must be appeased by the “dead perfection” of the place’s cuisine.Even the music there seemed to be always playing da capo."
"于是他开始幻想自己在城里饭菜便宜但信用度却不高的饭店里用餐，那里有来自世界各地的古怪厨师，他们将本国的烹饪技术带给了什么食物都吃的美国人。那里可能会有非同寻常的事情发生——他可能遇到没有谓语的主语、没有尽头的大路、没有答案的问题、没有结果的起因，以及生活的咸水海洋中的一泓清溪。他没有穿晚礼服，以一身简单的深色商业套装代之，即使是在服务员穿着短袖衬衫的意式餐厅，他的穿着也不会引人质疑。","Fancy came to him that he would dine at some cheap, even dubious, restaurant lower down in the city, where the erratic chefs from all countries of the world spread their national cookery for the omnivorous American.Something might happen there out of the routine—he might come upon a subject without a predicate, a road without an end, a question without an answer, a cause without an effect, a gulf stream in life’s salt ocean.He had not dressed for evening; he wore a dark business suit that would not be questioned even where the waiters served the spaghetti in their shirt sleeves."
"所以约翰·雷金纳德·福斯特开始在口袋里到处找钱；因为越是在便宜的饭店用餐，你越是应当付钱。他仔细地摸遍了商业套装大大小小十三个口袋，可是一分钱都没有找到。他的存折显示他在老艾恩赛德信托公司的存款可是有五位数的，但是——","So John Reginald Forster began to search his clothes for money; because the more cheaply you dine, the more surely must you pay.All of the thirteen pockets, large and small, of his business suit he explored carefully and found not a penny.His bank book showed a balance of five figures to his credit in the Old Ironsides Trust Company, but—"
"福斯特开始注意到他左手边有个人正饶有兴致地看着他。他看起来三十岁左右，像是位商人，穿着整洁，正站在那里等电车。但是那条街是没有电车线路的。因此，他靠得这么近，又不加掩饰他的好奇心，这福斯特觉得他的举止不免带有几分侵犯他私事的性质。但是作为“附近所闻”始终如一的探索者，他没有显示出任何的怒意，而是冲那个对他极为感兴趣的人尴尬地笑了笑。","Forster became aware of a man nearby at his left hand who was really regarding him with some amusement.He looked like any business man of thirty or so, neatly dressed and standing in the attitude of one waiting for a street car.But there was no car line on that avenue.So his proximity and unconcealed curiosity seemed to Forster to partake of the nature of a personal intrusion.But, as he was a consistent seeker after “What’s Around the Corner,” instead of manifesting resentment he only turned a half-embarrassed smile upon the other’s grin of amusement."
"“一分钱都没有吗？”那个爱管闲事的人走近一些问他。","“All in?” asked the intruder, drawing nearer."
"“看样子好像是，”福斯特说，“我原以为我口袋里可能还有一美元呢——”","“Seems so,” said Forster.“Now, I thought there was a dollar in—” "
"“哦，我知道，”那个人笑着说道，“可惜没有。我刚才在拐角也经历了同样的过程。我在背心上面的口袋里正好找到了两便士，我自己都不知道怎么会在那儿的。你知道，两便士什么都买不了！”","“Oh, I know,” said the other man, with a laugh.“But there wasn’t.I’ve just been through the same process myself, as I was coming around the corner.I found in an upper vest pocket—I don’t know how they got there—exactly two pennies.You know what kind of a dinner exactly two pennies will buy!”"
"“你也没有吃饭，对么？”福斯特问道。","“You haven’t dined, then?” asked Forster."
"“我还没吃。但是我想吃。现在，我有个提议。你看起来倒挺乐意接受的。你的穿着整洁而体面。请恕我冒昧。我认为我的着装肯定也能逃过服务员领班的打量。要不我们一起去那家饭店用餐。我们就像百万富翁一样点餐——或者，如果你愿意的话，我们也可以像生活境况一般的绅士一样偶尔奢侈地大吃一顿。吃完之后，用我的两便士抛掷，决定由谁去承受掌柜的不快和报复。我叫艾夫斯。我想我们的社会地位应该差不多——当我们还有钱时。”","“I have not.But I would like to.Now, I’ll make you a proposition.You look like a man who would take up one.Your clothes look neat and respectable.Excuse personalities.I think mine will pass the scrutiny of a head waiter, also.Suppose we go over to that hotel and dine together.We will choose from the menu like millionaires—or, if you prefer, like gentlemen in moderate circumstances dining extravagantly for once.When we have finished we will match with my two pennies to see which of us will stand the brunt of the house’s displeasure and vengeance.My name is Ives.I think we have lived in the same station of life—before our money took wings.”"
"“赌就赌吧。”福斯特快乐地说道。","“You’re on,” said Forster, joyfully."
"在神秘的机遇国度，这至少算得上是一次冒险——不管怎样，它赌的东西比这顿令人不爽的饭要好得多。","Here was a venture at least within the borders of the mysterious country of Chance—anyhow, it promised something better than the stale infestivity of a table d’hôte."
"于是两个人很快在那家餐厅角落的桌旁坐了下来。艾夫斯把他的一个便士从桌子上抛给了福斯特。","The two were soon seated at a corner table in the hotel dining room.Ives chucked one of his pennies across the table to Forster."
"“决定由谁来点餐。”他说。","“Match for which of us gives the order,” he said."
"福斯特输了。","Forster lost."
"艾夫斯大笑起来，然后开始让服务员上菜和酒，那专心致志、冷静斟酌的样子一看就知道他是个点菜的老手。福斯特一边听着一边表示赞赏和同意。","Ives laughed and began to name liquids and viands to the waiter with the absorbed but calm deliberation of one who was to the menu born.Forster, listening, gave his admiring approval of the order."
"“我这个人呀，”在上牡蛎期间，艾夫斯说，“一直对‘欲知后事如何’这方面的问题苦苦寻求。我不像只是垂涎于奖赏的一般冒险家。我也不像那些明知会有输赢还下赌注的赌徒。我想要的是邂逅一次不知结果的冒险。就好像呼吸对我来说是真实存在的，我需要有勇气去面对最盲目的命运。世界的运转越来越机械且有规律，以至于所有的机遇小径上你都能找到告知你会在小径的尽头遇到什么的标识牌。我就好像是啰嗦部门的职员，只要一有人来咨询就会抱怨不已。然后推荐给自己的同事说：‘他想了解的你最清楚了！’反正我不想知道，我也不愿去推断，不想作任何的猜测——我所想的是不看手里的牌就直接下赌注。”","“I am a man,” said Ives, during the oysters, “Who has made a lifetime search after the to-be-continued-in-our-next.I am not like the ordinary adventurer who strikes for a coveted prize.Nor yet am I like a gambler who knows he is either to win or lose a certain set stake.What I want is to encounter an adventure to which I can predict no conclusion.It is the breath of existence to me to dare Fate in its blindest manifestations.The world has come to run so much by rote and gravitation that you can enter upon hardly any footpath of chance in which you do not find signboards informing you of what you may expect at its end.I am like the clerk in the Circumlocution Office who always complained bitterly when any one came in to ask information.‘He wanted to know, you know!’ was the kick he made to his fellow-clerks.Well, I don’t want to know, I don’t want to reason, I don’t want to guess—I want to bet my hand without seeing it.”"
"“我明白了，”福斯特愉快地说，“我常常想把我的想法用言语表达出来。而你却做到了这一点。我想抓住每一次到来的机会。下一道菜时我们来一瓶摩泽尔白葡萄酒如何？”","“I understand,” said Forster delightedly.“I’ve often wanted the way I feel put into words.You’ve done it.I want to take chances on what’s coming.Suppose we have a bottle of Moselle with the next course.”"
"“我赞同，”艾夫斯说，“我很高兴你能理解我的意思。它会让店主对吃霸王餐的人更加憎恨。如果你不厌倦的话，我们将继续探讨这个话题。我很少遇见真正的风险家——也就是那种不向命运索要日程和地图就开始一段旅程的人。但是，由于世人比从前更文明、更明智了，想要开始一段无法预知结果的旅程已经变得越来越困难了。伊丽莎白时期，你可以攻击守门人，拧下门环，如果有时间的话在墙角直接拔出剑来与人大快淋漓地搏击一番，然后安然离开。现今，如果你对一名警察说话不恭敬，你只能够浪漫地幻想一番后，揣测他将把你送到哪家警察局。”","“Agreed,” said Ives.“I’m glad you catch my idea.It will increase the animosity of the house toward the loser.If it does not weary you, we will pursue the theme.Only a few times have I met a true venturer—one who does not ask a schedule and map from Fate when he begins a journey.But, as the world becomes more civilized and wiser, the more difficult it is to come upon an adventure the end of which you cannot foresee.In the Elizabethan days you could assault the watch, wring knockers from doors and have a jolly set-to with the blades in any convenient angle of a wall and ‘get away with it.’Nowadays, if you speak disrespectfully to a policeman, all that is left to the most romantic fancy is to conjecture in what particular police station he will land you.”"
"“我知道——我知道。”福斯特赞许地点点头。","“I know—I know,” said Forster, nodding approval."
"三年的环球旅行之后，我是今天刚回到纽约的，”艾夫斯继续说道，“国外的境况比起国内也好不到哪里去。整个世界似乎都被结局肆意地掌控着。唯一使我感兴趣的就是前提。我在非洲射击过猛兽。我知道高速步枪的射程；当大象或犀牛中弹倒地时，我会像小时候放学之后被留校在黑板上做很长的算术题那样快活。”","“I returned to New York to-day,” continued Ives, “from a three years’ ramble around the globe.Things are not much better abroad than they are at home.The whole world seems to be overrun by conclusions.The only thing that interests me greatly is a premise.I’ve tried shooting big game in Africa.I know what an express rifle will do at so many yards; and when an elephant or a rhinoceros falls to the bullet, I enjoy it about as much as I did when I was kept in after school to do a sum in long division on the blackboard.”"
"“我明白——我明白。”福斯特说。","“I know—I know,” said Forster."
"“飞机里可能会有什么东西，”艾夫斯陷入了沉思，继续说道，“我尝试过操纵气球，但那看起来也只不过是风和压载物预先准备好的事情。”","“There might be something in aeroplanes,” went on Ives, reflectively.“I’ve tried ballooning; but it seems to be merely a cut-and-dried affair of wind and ballast.”"
"“那女人呢。”福斯特笑着问道。","“Women,” suggested Forster, with a smile."
"“三个月前，”艾夫斯说，“我在君士坦丁堡的一个集市闲逛。我看见了一个女士，当然是蒙着面，但露出了一双很美丽的大眼睛。那时她正在一个货摊上看琥珀和珍珠饰品。在她身边是一名身材魁梧、肤色跟煤炭一样黑的努比亚随从。过了一会儿，那个随从慢慢地向我走近，然后把一张纸条悄悄地塞进了我的手中。逮着个机会，我看了一下那张纸条。纸上有几个仓促而潦草的铅笔字：‘今晚九点夜莺公园拱形门见’。福斯特先生，你觉得那是个有趣的前提吗？”","“Three months ago,” said Ives.“I was pottering around in one of the bazaars in Constantinople.I noticed a lady, veiled, of course, but with a pair of especially fine eyes visible, who was examining some amber and pearl ornaments at one of the booths.With her was an attendant—a big Nubian, as black as coal.After a while the attendant drew nearer to me by degrees and slipped a scrap of paper into my hand.I looked at it when I got a chance.On it was scrawled hastily in pencil: ‘The arched gate of the Nightingale Garden at nine to-night.’Does that appear to you to be an interesting premise, Mr. Forster?”"
"“我打听了一下，得知那个夜莺花园归属于一个土耳其老人的——他应该是一个大维齐尔之类的大人物。当然，我自己先去拱形门勘测了一番，九点钟我就到那里了。之前的那个努比亚随从准时为我打开了拱形门，我走了进去，和那位女士一起坐在芬芳扑鼻的喷泉旁的长凳上。我们聊了许久。她叫默特尔·汤普森，是一名女记者，为芝加哥报社撰写关于土耳其人的闺房之事。她说在集市上看到我一身纽约穿着，就猜想我能不能使她的文章得以在大都市报刊上发表。”","“I made inquiries and learned that the Nightingale Garden was the property of an old Turk—a grand vizier, or something of the sort.Of course I prospected for the arched gate and was there at nine.The same Nubian attendant opened the gate promptly on time, and I went inside and sat on a bench by a perfumed fountain with the veiled lady.We had quite an extended chat.She was Myrtle Thompson, a lady journalist, who was writing up the Turkish harems for a Chicago newspaper.She said she noticed the New York cut of my clothes in the bazaar and wondered if I couldn’t work something into the metropolitan papers about it.”"
"“原来是这样啊，”福斯特说，“我明白啦。”","“I see,” said Forster.“I see.”"
"“我曾乘独木舟穿过加拿大的许多湍流和瀑布，”艾夫斯说，“但是我似乎没有得到我想要的。因为我知道只有两种可能的结果——我不是下沉到水底就是漂到海平面上去。我玩过很多纸牌游戏，但数学家算出的概率将游戏的兴致一扫而光。我在火车上结识了一些陌生人，去过一些广告公司面试，按响过陌生人的门铃，我抓住了每个找上门来的机会；但总是以一贯的结局告终——对前提合乎情理的结论。”","“I’ve canoed through Canada,” said Ives, “down many rapids and over many falls.But I didn’t seem to get what I wanted out of it because I knew there were only two possible outcomes—I would either go to the bottom or arrive at the sea level.I’ve played all games at cards; but the mathematicians have spoiled that sport by computing the percentages.I’ve made acquaintances on trains, I’ve answered advertisements, I’ve rung strange door-bells, I’ve taken every chance that presented itself; but there has always been the conventional ending—the logical conclusion to the premise.”"
"“我明白，”福斯特说，“我也有过这种感受。但是机会来临时我却很少有机会抓住我的机会。哪里的生活像这个城市的一样，如此缺乏不可预测的事？我们似乎有无数的机会去验证不确定的事，但是不符合预期结果的机率不到千分之一。我真希望地铁和电车偶尔能让人失望一次。”","“I know,” repeated Forster.“I’ve felt it all.But I’ve had few chances to take my chance at chances.Is there any life so devoid of impossibilities as life in this city?There seems to be a myriad of opportunities for testing the undeterminable; but not one in a thousand fails to land you where you expected it to stop.I wish the subways and street cars disappointed one as seldom.”"
"“那真是晚上出太阳，”艾夫斯说，再也没有哈里发了。渔夫的瓶子变成了真空瓶，使任何一个被煮熟了或者冻僵了的妖怪都能保温四十八个小时。生活总是一成不变。科学使得冒险灭绝。再也没有像哥伦布发现新大陆和第一次吃螃蟹的机会了。我们唯一确定的是，世界上再也没有什么不确定的事了。”","“The sun has risen,” said Ives, “on the Arabian nights.There are no more caliphs.The fisherman’s vase is turned to a vacuum bottle, warranted to keep any genie boiling or frozen for forty-eight hours.Life moves by rote.Science has killed adventure.There are no more opportunities such as Columbus and the man who ate the first oyster had.The only certain thing is that there is nothing uncertain.”"
"“哎，”福斯特说，“我自己毕竟是个城里人，经验有限。我没有你那么见多识广，但是看起来我们却持有相同的观点。但是，我告诉你，我对于这次我们有幸一起在这个偶然的领域冒这个小小的险深感愉快。当晚餐的账单出来时，我们可能会窒息那么一小会儿。毕竟，一个不带临行凭证或钱包就上路的旅行家，比带着随从盔甲，衬衫里放着亚瑟王的保付支票去国外参加协商会议的圆桌骑士要更能体味生活的意味。现在如果你的咖啡已经喝完了，我们是不是要用你仅有的硬币来决定一下，由谁去应付即将到来的命运的挑战。你赌哪面朝上啊？”","“Well,” said Forster, “my experience has been the limited one of a city man.I haven’t seen the world as you have; but it seems that we view it with the same opinion.But, I tell you I am grateful for even this little venture of ours into the borders of the haphazard.There may be at least one breathless moment when the bill for the dinner is presented.Perhaps, after all, the pilgrims who traveled without scrip or purse found a keener taste to life than did the knights of the Round Table who rode abroad with a retinue and King Arthur’s certified checks in the lining of their helmets.And now, if you’ve finished your coffee, suppose we match one of your insufficient coins for the impending blow of Fate.What have I up?”"
"“我赌正面。”艾夫斯喊道。","“Heads,” called Ives."
"“果然是正面朝上，”福斯特举起手说道，“我输了。我们忘了商量如何设法让赢家脱身。我建议当服务员来的时候，你就说要打电话给一个朋友。我会留守要塞并慢慢核实账单，给你足够的时间拿帽子离开。艾夫斯先生，感谢你和我一起度过了一个非同寻常的夜晚，若有机会，我希望我们下次再聚。”","“Heads it is,” said Forster, lifting his hand.“I lose.We forgot to agree upon a plan for the winner to escape.I suggest that when the waiter comes you make a remark about telephoning to a friend.I will hold the fort and the dinner check long enough for you to get your hat and be off.I thank you for an evening out of the ordinary, Mr. Ives, and wish we might have others.”"
"“如果我没记错的话，”艾夫斯笑着说，“离这最近的警局应该是在麦克杜格街吧。说真的，这顿晚餐我也相当愉快。”","“If my memory is not at fault,” said Ives, laughing, “the nearest police station is in MacDougal Street.I have enjoyed the dinner, too, let me assure you.”"
"福斯特弯了弯手指，招呼服务员。维克多迅速滑步到桌旁，把账单扣着放在输了的一方的杯子旁。福斯特把账单拿了起来，特别仔细地算起了总额。而艾夫斯则安逸地躺在椅子上。","Forster crooked his finger for the waiter.Victor, with a locomotive effort that seemed to owe more to pneumatics than to pedestrianism, glided to the table and laid the card, face downward, by the loser’s cup.Forster took it up and added the figures with deliberate care.Ives leaned back comfortably in his chair."
"“对不起，”福斯特说，“我想起来了，你不是要打电话给格兰姆斯商谈关于星期四晚上一起看戏的事吗？你不会忘记了吧？”","“Excuse me,” said Forster; “but I thought you were going to ring Grimes about that theatre party for Thursday night.Had you forgotten about it?”"
"“哦，”艾夫斯舒舒服服地调整了一下坐姿说道，“我可以呆会儿再打啊。服务员，请给我一杯水。”","“Oh,” said Ives, settling himself more comfortably, “I can do that later on.Get me a glass of water, waiter.”"
"“你想看看结果，是吗？”福斯特问。","“Want to be in at the death, do you?” asked Forster."
"“希望你不会反对啊，”艾夫斯苦苦哀求道，“我这一生从来没见过一个绅士因在公共餐馆吃霸王餐而被逮捕。”","“I hope you don’t object,” said Ives, pleadingly.“Never in my life have I seen a gentleman arrested in a public restaurant for swindling it out of a dinner.”"
"“好吧，”福斯特冷静地说，“就当作是咖啡后的小酌吧，你有权看到基督徒死在竞技场上。”","“All right,” said Forster, calmly.“You are entitled to see a Christian die in the arena as your pousse-café.”"
"维克多端来了一杯水，然后像一个不屈不挠的讨债人似的站在桌旁不走。","Victor came with the glass of water and remained, with the disengaged air of an inexorable collector."
"福斯特犹豫了十五秒钟之后，然后从口袋里拿出一支铅笔，在晚餐账单上草草地签下了他的名字。服务员鞠了个躬，把账单拿走了。","Forster hesitated for fifteen seconds, and then took a pencil from his pocket and scribbled his name on the dinner check.The waiter bowed and took it away."
"“事实是这样的，”福斯特尴尬地笑着说，“我不知道我是不是他们所谓的‘大玩家’，也就是那种追名逐利的人。我不得不坦白招认。一年来，我每周都在这家餐厅吃两三顿饭。我总是签下支票。”然后，他带着赞赏的语气说：“你明明知道我口袋里没有钱，你还冒着被送进警察局的危险陪我玩这个游戏，实在佩服。”","“The fact is,” said Forster, with a little embarrassed laugh, “I doubt whether I’m what they call a ‘game sport,’ which means the same as a ‘soldier of Fortune.’I’ll have to make a confession.I’ve been dining at this hotel two or three times a week for more than a year.I always sign my checks.”And then, with a note of appreciation in his voice: “It was first-rate of you to stay to see me through with it when you knew I had no money, and that you might be scooped in, too.”"
"“我想这下我也得招认了，”艾夫斯露齿而笑，“我是这家饭店的老板。当然，我自己没有亲自经营，但是在三楼有一套我专用的客房，供我偶尔来纽约时住。”","“I guess I’ll confess, too,” said Ives, with a grin.“I own the hotel.I don’t run it, of course, but I always keep a suite on the third floor for my use when I happen to stray into town.”"
"他招呼一个服务员问道：“吉尔摩先生在办公室吗？好。你通知他一声，艾夫斯先生来了，让他把我的房间安排好，通通风。”","He called a waiter and said: “Is Mr. Gilmore still behind the desk?All right.Tell him that Mr. Ives is here, and ask him to have my rooms made ready and aired.”"
"“无可避免地又一次风险中断了，”福斯特说，“下次你还有解不开的难题吗？如果你愿意的话，我们可以再花一两分钟谈这个话题。能够理解我找出的这些现实存在的缺陷的人并不多。我下个月就要结婚了。”","“Another venture cut short by the inevitable,” said Forster.“Is there a conundrum without an answer in the next number?But let’s hold to our subject just for a minute or two, if you will.It isn’t often that I meet a man who understands the flaws I pick in existence.I am engaged to be married a month from to-day.”"
"“我保留意见。”艾夫斯说。","“I reserve comment,” said Ives."
"“对了，我还有话要说。我真心喜欢那位女士，但是我不能确定能不能在结婚那天在教堂出现，或者说，我可能要一个人溜达去阿拉斯加。你明白，还是那个话题——考虑所有的可能性，结婚会带给人什么样的变化。谁都知道这个惯例——早餐之后，妻子会给你锡兰茶似的甜蜜亲吻；然后你去上班；下班之后回家，换好衣服外出吃饭——一周看两次电影——各种消费——大多数晚上都无精打采，出去溜达想找找话题——偶尔和妻子争吵一番——有时甚至大吵一番，然后分居——或者最糟的情况就是等风波平息之后勉强一起过日子。”","“Right; I am going to add to the assertion.I am devotedly fond of the lady; but I can’t decide whether to show up at the church or make a sneak for Alaska.It’s the same idea, you know, that we were discussing—it does for a fellow as far as possibilities are concerned.Everybody knows the routine—you get a kiss flavored with Ceylon tea after breakfast; you go to the office; you come back home and dress for dinner—theatre twice a week—bills—moping around most evenings trying to make conversation—a little quarrel occasionally—maybe sometimes a big one, and a separation—or else a settling down into a middle-aged contentment, which is worst of all.”"
"“我知道。”艾夫斯明智地点点头。","“I know,” said Ives, nodding wisely."
"“最令我疑惑不安的是事情的必然性，”福斯特说，“再也没有什么事情不可知了。”","“It’s the dead certainty of the thing,” went on Forster, “that keeps me in doubt.There’ll nevermore be anything around the corner.”"
"“确实婚礼之后的事情不言而喻，”艾夫斯说。“我知道。”","“Nothing after the ‘Little Church,’” said Ives.“I know.”"
"“你知道的，”福斯特说，“我对那个女士的感情是毋庸置疑的。我可以说我真的是深爱着她。但是我的血液里有一股浪潮强烈反对任何能预测的事。我不知道我究竟想要什么；但是我知道我需要它。我像个白痴一样说这些话，但是我很肯定我的意思。”","“Understand,” said Forster, “that I am in no doubt as to my feelings toward the lady.I may say that I love her truly and deeply.But there is something in the current that runs through my veins that cries out against any form of the calculable.I do not know what I want; but I know that I want it.I’m talking like an idiot, I suppose, but I’m sure of what I mean.”"
"“我理解你，”艾夫斯微微笑了笑说，“我想我现在要回房了。如果哪天我还能和你一起共进晚餐，福斯特先生，我将非常高兴。”","“I understand you,” said Ives, with a slow smile.“Well, I think I will be going up to my rooms now.If you would dine with me here one evening soon, Mr.  Forster, I’d be glad.”"
"“星期四如何？”福斯特提议道。","“Thursday?” suggested Forster."
"“如果方便的话，就七点吧。”艾夫斯说道。","“At seven, if it’s convenient,” answered Ives."
"“那就七点。”福斯特同意道。","“Seven goes,” assented Forster."
"八点半时艾夫斯叫了一辆出租车，来到西区七十几街的一户人家。他出示了一下名片便进入了一幢老式的接待室，那里是运气、机遇和冒险从来都不敢进去的地方。墙上挂着惠斯勒的蚀刻版画、不知名的铜板画、葡萄和花园的静态画、桌上的西瓜籽栩栩如生，还有格勒兹的肖像画。那是一个人家的住房。那里还有铁制的黄铜支架。桌上放着一本半摩洛哥革半氧化银的相簿，相簿的各个棱角有银片保护。壁炉架上的大钟八点五十五的时候会大声地敲击一下。艾夫斯好奇地瞅了瞅，回忆起他祖母家也有这么一个钟会发出这样的声音。","At half-past eight Ives got into a cab and was driven to a number in one of the correct West Seventies.His card admitted him to the reception room of an old-fashioned house into which the spirits of Fortune, Chance and Adventure had never dared to enter.On the walls were the Whistler etchings, the steel engravings by Oh-what’s-his-name?, the still-life paintings of the grapes and garden truck with the watermelon seeds spilled on the table as natural as life, and the Greuze head.It was a household.There was even brass andirons.On a table was an album, half-morocco, with oxidized-silver protections on the corners of the lids.A clock on the mantel ticked loudly, with a warning click at five minutes to nine.Ives looked at it curiously, remembering a time-piece in his grandmother’s home that gave such a warning."
"这时，玛丽·马斯登从楼上走了下来，进入了房间。她二十四岁，至于模样由你自己去想象吧。但是我必须说的是：年轻、健康、单纯、勇敢、绿紫色的大眼睛是美丽的象征，而这一切她都完全具备。她带着老朋友的甜蜜和真诚向艾夫斯伸出手来。","And then down the stairs and into the room came Mary Marsden.She was twenty-four, and I leave her to your imagination.But I must say this much—youth and health and simplicity and courage and greenish-violet eyes are beautiful, and she had all these.She gave Ives her hand with the sweet cordiality of an old friendship."
"“每三年左右你才会来一次，”她说，“你难以想象我有多高兴。”","“You can’t think what a pleasure it is,” she said, “to have you drop in once every three years or so.”"
"他们在一起谈了半个小时。我承认我不能够复述他们的谈话。那些话你可以在收费租书的图书馆里看到。谈完后，玛丽说：","For half an hour they talked.I confess that I cannot repeat the conversation.You will find it in books in the circulating library.When that part of it was over, Mary said: "
"“你在国外找到了你想要的东西了吗？”","“And did you find what you wanted while you were abroad?”"
"“我想要的东西？”艾夫斯说。","“What I wanted?” said Ives."
"“是的，你知道你的性格一向怪异。甚至小的时候你不爱玩弹球、棒球或是其他一些有规则的游戏。你喜欢跳进连你自己都不知道是十英寸还是十英尺深的水里。长大以后你还是一样。我们常常在一起谈论你的怪癖。”","“Yes.You know you were always queer.Even as a boy you wouldn’t play marbles or baseball or any game with rules.You wanted to dive in water where you didn’t know whether it was ten inches or ten feet deep.And when you grew up you were just the same.We’ve often talked about your peculiar ways.”"
"“我想我是无可救药了，”艾夫斯说，“我反对命运教条，反对比例的运算守则，反对引力定律，反对征税等诸如此类的事情。生活对我来说就像是连载的小说，只不过每一期都会登出后期的摘要。”","“I suppose I am an incorrigible,” said Ives.“I am opposed to the doctrine of predestination, to the rule of three, gravitation, taxation, and everything of the kind.Life has always seemed to me something like a serial story would be if they printed above each instalment a synopsis of succeeding chapters.”"
"玛丽开心地笑了笑。","Mary laughed merrily."
"“有一次，鲍勃·埃姆斯跟我们讲了一件你做的趣事，”她说，“那时你们俩在南方乘火车，你突然在一个本不打算停留的城镇下车，仅仅是因为司匣员挂出了下一站站名的牌子。”","“Bob Ames told us once,” she said, “of a funny thing you did.It was when you and he were on a train in the South, and you got off at a town where you hadn’t intended to stop just because the brakeman hung up a sign in the end of the car with the name of the next station on it.”"
"“我记起来了，”艾夫斯说，“我总是要逃脱那个‘下一站’。”","“I remember,” said Ives.“That ‘next station’ has been the thing I’ve always tried to get away from.”"
"“我知道，”玛丽说，“你一直很傻。我希望在这三年里你没有碰到你不想找的东西，或者没有在根本不存在的站点下车，也没有遇到你期待发生的事情。”","“I know it,” said Mary.“And you’ve been very foolish.I hope you didn’t find what you wanted not to find, or get off at the station where there wasn’t any, or whatever it was you expected wouldn’t happen to you during the three years you’ve been away.”"
"“在我离开之前我还想要一样东西。”艾夫斯说。","“There was something I wanted before I went away,” said Ives."
"玛丽带着一丝浅浅而甜甜的笑盯着他的眼睛。","Mary looked in his eyes clearly, with a slight, but perfectly sweet smile."
"“那是，”她说，“你想要我。你应当很清楚，你早就可以得到我。”","“There was,” she said.“You wanted me.And you could have had me, as you very well know.”"
"艾夫斯没有回答，只是慢慢地扫视着整个房间。自从他三年前来到这里之后，这里没有任何变化。他清晰地回忆起他当年的想法。整个房间就像不朽的山脉一样亘古不变。除了时间和衰败这两个不可避免的原因造成的变化之外，一切还都是原封不动。银色镶嵌的相簿还放在那个桌角，那些版画依旧挂在墙上，那些椅子在每天早上、中午和晚上只要有人在的时候都会被放到老地方。黄铜的柴架是秩序和稳定的见证。到处都是一百年之前的遗迹，很多年之后都将成为鲜活的纪念物。在那个房子里来来回回的人,无需任何的怀疑和推测。他找到了他曾经留下的东西，并把他发现的东西留了下来。那个蒙着面纱的夫人，也就是机遇女神，永远不会主动叩门。","Without replying, Ives let his gaze wander slowly about the room.There had been no change in it since last he had been in it, three years before.He vividly recalled the thoughts that had been in his mind then.The contents of that room were as fixed, in their way, as the everlasting hills.No change would ever come there except the inevitable ones wrought by time and decay.That silver-mounted album would occupy that corner of that table, those pictures would hang on the walls, those chairs be found in their same places every morn and noon and night while the household hung together.The brass andirons were monuments to order and stability.Here and there were relics of a hundred years ago which were still living mementos and would be for many years to come.One going from and coming back to that house would never need to forecast or doubt.He would find what he left, and leave what he found.The veiled lady, Chance, would never lift her hand to the knocker on the outer door."
"坐在他面前的是这个房子的女主人。她清爽、甜蜜、安定。她一点儿也不会让人觉得惊讶。即使有一天她满头白发、满脸褶皱，和她共度一生的人也不会觉察到她的变化。他们分开三年了，她就像那所房子一样坚贞不渝地等着他。他很确信她曾经在乎过他。正是因为他知道她会如此执著，他才选择了离她而去。这使他的思绪有些凌乱。","And before him sat the lady who belonged in the room.Cool and sweet and unchangeable she was.She offered no surprises.If one should pass his life with her, though she might grow white-haired and wrinkled, he would never perceive the change.Three years he had been away from her, and she was still waiting for him as established and constant as the house itself.He was sure that she had once cared for him.It was the knowledge that she would always do so that had driven him away.Thus his thoughts ran."
"“我快要结婚了。”玛丽说。","“I am going to be married soon,” said Mary."
"星期四下午，福斯特匆忙赶到艾夫斯的饭店。","On the next Thursday afternoon Forster came hurriedly to Ive’s hotel."
"“老兄，”他说，“我不得不把我们的饭局推迟一年左右了；因为我就要出国了。轮船四点钟启航。那一晚愉快的谈话使我下定了决心。我将周游全世界，摆脱你我身上沉重的负担——对于即将要发生的事饱含的恐惧感。我知道我做了一件丧失良心的事；但是我知道这样做对我们都好。我已经写信给了那个和我已经订了婚的女士，并且向她解释了一切——我坦诚地告诉了她我离开的原因——单调的婚姻生活我真的无法接受。你认为我做得对吗？”","“Old man,” said he, “we’ll have to put that dinner off for a year or so; I’m going abroad.The steamer sails at four.That was a great talk we had the other night, and it decided me.I’m going to knock around the world and get rid of that incubus that has been weighing on both you and me—the terrible dread of knowing what’s going to happen.I’ve done one thing that hurts my conscience a little; but I know it’s best for both of us.I’ve written to the lady to whom I was engaged and explained everything—told her plainly why I was leaving—that the monotony of matrimony would never do for me.Don’t you think I was right?”"
"“这个我不好说，”艾夫斯回答，“如果你认为射击大象会给你的生活增添机遇，那就去吧。这些事情应当由我们自己决定。但是，福斯特，我要告诉你，我已经找到办法了。我发现了全世界最冒险的事情——一场永远没有结局的游戏，一个结果可能是九重天亦或是无底深渊的冒险。它会使一个人忐忑不安，直到棺材入土，因为他到死都不知道——甚至死了他也不会知道。这是一次没有船舵和指南针的航海，无论白天还是夜晚，你都必须自己当船长、船员，必须自己放哨，没有任何人会帮你解围。我已经找到值得冒险的事情了。福斯特，别再为离开玛丽·马斯登而烦恼了。我昨天中午就和她结婚了。”","“It is not for me to say,” answered Ives.“Go ahead and shoot elephants if you think it will bring the element of chance into your life.We’ve got to decide these things for ourselves.But I tell you one thing, Forster, I’ve found the way.I’ve found out the biggest hazard in the world—a game of chance that never is concluded, a venture that may end in the highest heaven or the blackest pit.It will keep a man on edge until the clods fall on his coffin, because he will never know—not until his last day, and not then will he know.It is a voyage without a rudder or compass, and you must be captain and crew and keep watch, every day and night, yourself, with no one to relieve you.I have found the Venture.Don’t bother yourself about leaving Mary Marsden, Forster.I married her yesterday at noon.”"
