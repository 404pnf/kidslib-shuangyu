"眼下这个季节和这个时刻，公园里基本没什么游客；那位坐在人行道旁边一条长椅上的年轻女士可能只是心血来潮，想坐一会儿预先享受下即将到来的春天。","It was neither the season nor the hour when the Park had frequenters; and it is likely that the young lady, who was seated on one of the benches at the side of the walk, had merely obeyed a sudden impulse to sit for a while and enjoy a foretaste of coming Spring."
"她沉思着，坐在那里一动不动。她脸上的那一丝忧郁定是近来新添的，因为它尚未改变她青春美丽的面颊，也没柔和她嘴唇上那翘起的坚定的曲线。","She rested there, pensive and still.A certain melancholy that touched her countenance must have been of recent birth, for it had not yet altered the fine and youthful contours of her cheek, nor subdued the arch though resolute curve of her lips."
"她坐着的地方附近有一条小路，一个高大的年轻男子正沿着这小路大步穿过公园。他身后跟着个提手提箱的男孩。看到那姑娘，年轻人的脸一红，又转白了。他边走近边看着她的表情，自己的脸上也交织着希望和焦虑。他在距她几码的地方经过，却没看到任何迹象表明她意识到他来了或他存在。","A tall young man came striding through the park along the path near which she sat.Behind him tagged a boy carrying a suit-case.At sight of the young lady, the man’s face changed to red and back to pale again.He watched her countenance as he drew nearer, with hope and anxiety mingled on his own.He passed within a few yards of her, but he saw no evidence that she was aware of his presence or existence."
"他继续走了五十来码，突然停了下来，坐在了一边的长椅上。小男孩放下手提箱，一双疑惑而机灵的眼睛盯着他。年轻人掏出手帕擦了擦额头。手帕精致，额头轩昂，年轻人也很俊朗。他对男孩说：","Some fifty yards further on he suddenly stopped and sat on a bench at one side.The boy dropped the suit-case and stared at him with wondering, shrewd eyes.The young man took out his handkerchief and wiped his brow.It was a good handkerchief, a good brow, and the young man was good to look at.He said to the boy: "
"“我要你捎个口信给坐在那长椅上的年轻女士。告诉她，我现在就要去车站前往旧金山，然后赶去阿拉斯加参加狩猎队打麋鹿。告诉她，她不让我和她说话，也不让我给她写信，我只得用这种方式对她提出最后的请求，请她看在过去的份上对我公平点。告诉她，责怪并抛弃一个不该受此对待的人，既不说明理由，又不给人解释的机会，这不符合她在我心目中的本性。告诉她，我这样做虽然在某种程度上违背了她的禁令，但只是希望她以后能稍稍对待我公平点。去吧，告诉她这些。”","“I want you to take a message to that young lady on that bench.Tell her I am on my way to the station, to leave for San Francisco, where I shall join that Alaska moose-hunting expedition.Tell her that, since she has commanded me neither to speak nor to write to her, I take this means of making one last appeal to her sense of justice, for the sake of what has been.Tell her that to condemn and discard one who has not deserved such treatment, without giving him her reasons or a chance to explain is contrary to her nature as I believe it to be.Tell her that I have thus, to a certain degree, disobeyed her injunctions, in the hope that she may yet be inclined to see justice done.Go, and tell her that.”"
"年轻人在男孩手里丢了半元银币。男孩脏兮兮的聪明脸蛋上那双明亮机敏的眼睛看了他片刻，然后迈步跑去了。他有点迟疑但并不局促地走近长椅上的女子。他碰了碰扣在后脑勺上的旧格子花呢自行车运动帽的帽檐。女子冷静地看着他，既不反感也不热情。","The young man dropped a half-dollar into the boy’s hand.The boy looked at him for a moment with bright, canny eyes out of a dirty, intelligent face, and then set off at a run.He approached the lady on the bench a little doubtfully, but unembarrassed.He touched the brim of the old plaid bicycle cap perched on the back of his head.The lady looked at him coolly, without prejudice or favour."
"“女士，”他说，“那边长椅上的先生派我给你表演一段歌舞。如果您不认识他，而他别有用心，您说句话，我三分钟之内就叫个警察来。如果您认识他，且他是实诚人，我就把他让我传的那番话说给你听。”","“Lady,” he said, “dat gent on de oder bench sent yer a song and dance by me.If yer don’t know de guy, and he’s tryin’ to do de Johnny act, say de word, and I’ll call a cop in t’ree minutes.If yer does know him, and he’s on de square, w’y I’ll spiel yer de bunch of hot air he sent yer.”"
"年轻女子稍稍表现出了点兴趣。","The young lady betrayed a faint interest."
"“一段歌舞！”她说道，从容而甜美的嗓音似乎给她那难以弄明白的带着讽刺意味的话语裹上了一层若有似无的透明外衣。“这主意倒新鲜——我想他是从行吟诗人那儿学来的吧。我——以前认识派你来的那位先生，所以我想没什么必要找警察。你可以表演你的歌舞，但别唱得太大声。现在演露天歌舞剧早了点儿，会引人注意的。”","“A song and dance!” she said, in a deliberate sweet voice that seemed to clothe her words in a diaphanous garment of impalpable irony.“A new idea—in the troubadour line, I suppose.I—used to know the gentleman who sent you, so I think it will hardly be necessary to call the police.You may execute your song and dance, but do not sing too loudly.It is a little early yet for open-air vaudeville, and we might attract attention.”"
"“好嘞，”男孩耸了耸肩说，“你知道我的意思，女士。我不是要表演什么，而是说几句话。他让我告诉你他把衣服都收拾进手提箱，马上要坐车去旧金山了。然后他要去克朗代克打雪鸟。他说你让他别再给你送情书，也别在你花园门前转悠，他就用这种方式点醒你。他说你把他当过时人物判了出局，也没给他机会对你的决定提出申诉。他说你踹了他，却没说过原因。”","“Awe,” said the boy, with a shrug down the length of him, “yer know what I mean, lady.’Tain’t a turn, it’s wind.He told me to tell yer he’s got his collars and cuffs in dat grip for a scoot clean out to ’Frisco.Den he’s goin’ to shoot snow-birds in de Klondike.He says yer told him not to send ’round no more pink notes nor come hangin’ over de garden gate, and he takes dis means of puttin’ yer wise.He says yer refereed him out like a has-been, and never give him no chance to kick at de decision.He says yer swiped him, and never said why.”"
"年轻女子眼里被唤起的微弱兴致并没有减少。也许是因为捕雪鸟者的创意和大胆吧，竟绕开了她下达的不准常规交流的命令。她定睛看着零乱的公园中的一座孤独站立的雕像，对传话人说：","The slightly awakened interest in the young lady’s eyes did not abate.Perhaps it was caused by either the originality or the audacity of the snow-bird hunter, in thus circumventing her express commands against the ordinary modes of communication.She fixed her eye on a statue standing disconsolate in the dishevelled park, and spoke into the transmitter: "
"“告诉那位先生我不需要再向他重申我的理想配偶类型。他知道我要求的是什么，以前是，现在仍然如此。就这次的情况而言，绝对忠诚和诚实是至高无上的。告诉他，我已经深刻剖析了我自己的心，我了解它的需要也了解它的软弱。所以我才拒绝听他的借口，不管那借口会是什么。我不是凭借道听途说或证据不足就定他罪，因此不需要再明说了。但既然他坚持要听他已清楚知道的事情，你可以这样转达给他。”","“Tell the gentleman that I need not repeat to him a description of my ideals.He knows what they have been and what they still are.So far as they touch on this case, absolute loyalty and truth are the ones paramount.Tell him that I have studied my own heart as well as one can, and I know its weakness as well as I do its needs.That is why I decline to hear his pleas, whatever they may be.I did not condemn him through hearsay or doubtful evidence, and that is why I made no charge.But, since he persists in hearing what he already well knows, you may convey the matter.”"
"“告诉他，那晚我从后面走进温室，去替我母亲剪一支玫瑰。告诉他我看到他和阿什伯顿小姐在那株粉色夹竹桃下。画面很美丽，但依偎在一起的姿势和亲昵太过生动明显，不需要任何解释。我离开了温室，同时也丢下了我的玫瑰和理想。你可以把那场歌舞带给你的经理人。”","“Tell him that I entered the conservatory that evening from the rear, to cut a rose for my mother.Tell him I saw him and Miss Ashburton beneath the pink oleander.The tableau was pretty, but the pose and juxtaposition were too eloquent and evident to require explanation.I left the conservatory, and, at the same time, the rose and my ideal.You may carry that song and dance to your impresario.”"
"“我有个词听不懂，女士。依偎——依偎——您能解释一下吗？”","“I’m shy on one word, lady.Jux—jux—put me wise on dat, will yer?”"
"“依偎——或者如果你喜欢可以称之为亲近，就是靠得太近，没法保持正常的距离。”","“Juxtaposition—or you may call it propinquity—or, if you like, being rather too near for one maintaining the position of an ideal.”"
"男孩踩着砂砾一溜烟跑去了。他站定在另一条长椅边。男子的双眼渴望地询问着他。小男孩的眼里闪现着一个传话人所具有的、不带任何个人情感的热忱。","The gravel spun from beneath the boy’s feet.He stood by the other bench.The man’s eyes interrogated him, hungrily.The boy’s were shining with the impersonal zeal of the translator."
"“那位女士说，当一个男人鬼话连篇想重归于好的时候，女人是很容易上当的，她一直知道这事实，所以才不听任何恭维话。她说你被她撞个正着，你那时在花房里搂着个穿印花布的姑娘。她从边上进去采些花，看见你紧搂着另一个姑娘。她说场面虽然动人，但叫她恶心。她说你最好还是抓紧时间赶火车去吧。”","“De lady says dat she’s on to de fact dat gals is dead easy when a feller comes spielin’ ghost stories and tryin’ to make up, and dat’s why she won’t listen to no soft-soap.She says she caught yer dead to rights, huggin’ a bunch o’ calico in de hot-house.She side-stepped in to pull some posies and yer was squeezin’ de oder gal to beat de band.She says it looked cute, all right all right, but it made her sick.She says yer better git busy, and make a sneak for de train.”"
"年轻人轻轻吹了声口哨，突然想到了什么，眼睛一闪。他把手伸进外套内袋，取出一沓信。他挑出了一封交给男孩，又从马甲口袋里取出一元银币给他。","The young man gave a low whistle and his eyes flashed with a sudden thought.His hand flew to the inside pocket of his coat, and drew out a handful of letters.Selecting one, he handed it to the boy, following it with a silver dollar from his vest-pocket."
"“把那份信给那位女士，”他说，“请她看看。告诉她这封信可以解释整个情况。告诉她，如果她在理想的信念里掺入一点信任，也许就可以避免许多心痛。告诉她，她如此珍视的忠诚从不曾动摇。告诉她，我等她的回复。”","“Give that letter to the lady,” he said, “and ask her to read it.Tell her that it should explain the situation.Tell her that, if she had mingled a little trust with her conception of the ideal, much heartache might have been avoided.Tell her that the loyalty she prizes so much has never wavered.Tell her I am waiting for an answer.”"
"信使又站到女士面前。","The messenger stood before the lady."
"“那位先生说他无缘无故地背了黑锅。他说他不是那种人；女士，你看看这封信，我敢和你打赌他是个正派人，就这样。”","“De gent says he’s had de ski-bunk put on him widout no cause.He says he’s no bum guy; and, lady, yer read dat letter, and I’ll bet yer he’s a white sport, all right.”"
"年轻女子打开信，将信将疑地看了。","The young lady unfolded the letter; somewhat doubtfully, and read it."
"亲爱的阿诺德医生：我想感谢您上周五晚最为好心又及时地对小女施以援手，当时她去沃尔德伦太太家做客，在温室里心脏旧疾突发。要不是您刚好在场，在她跌倒时扶住了她并给予恰当照顾，我们可能已经失去她了。若你能驾临寒舍负责小女的治疗，本人将不胜欣慰。","Dear Dr. Arnold: I want to thank you for your most kind and opportune aid to my daughter last Friday evening, when she was overcome by an attack of her old heart-trouble in the conservatory at Mrs. Waldron’s reception.Had you not been near to catch her as she fell and to render proper attention, we might have lost her.I would be glad if you would call and undertake the treatment of her case."
"感激您的，","Gratefully yours,"
"罗伯特·阿什伯顿","Robert Ashburton."
"年轻女子重新折好信，交给小男孩。","The young lady refolded the letter, and handed it to the boy."
"“那位先生要一个回复，”信使说，“要我说什么？”","“De gent wants an answer,” said the messenger.“Wot’s de word?”"
"女子的眼睛猛地瞥了他一眼，明亮的眼睛里闪动着喜悦的泪光。","The lady’s eyes suddenly flashed on him, bright, smiling and wet."
"“告诉那长椅上的家伙，”她幸福地颤声笑着说道，“他的恋人要他过来。”","“Tell that guy on the other bench,” she said, with a happy, tremulous laugh, “that his girl wants him.”"
