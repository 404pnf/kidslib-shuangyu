"生活对我意味着什么","What Life Means To Me"
"作者：杰克·伦敦","by Jack London"
"我出生在工人阶级的家庭。小时候，我就知道什么是热情、抱负和理想，而实现这些目标成了我孩童时代的难题。我身处于残酷、艰苦而又原始的环境中。我不想朝外看，只想往上看。我处于社会的底层。这里的生活给肉体和精神带来的，只有肮脏和苦难；因为在这里，肉体和精神都在忍饥挨饿、受尽折磨。","I was born in the working-class.Early I discovered enthusiasm, ambition, and ideals; and to satisfy these became the problem of my child-life.My environment was crude and rough and raw.I had no outlook, but an uplook rather.My place in society was at the bottom.Here life offered nothing but sordidness and wretchedness, both of the flesh and the spirit; for here flesh and spirit were alike starved and tormented."
"在我之上矗立着庞大的社会体系，而在我看来，唯一的出路就是往上爬。我很小的时候就下定决心要爬到这个体系中去。上流社会的男人们穿黑色的西服和前胸上浆的白衬衫，女人们都穿漂亮的礼服。那里还有好吃的食物，而且非常丰富。对肉体来说，这些足够了。接下来就是精神方面的需求。我知道，在我之上的阶级中有无私的精神、纯洁高尚的思想和头脑敏锐聪明的人。我知道这一切是因为我读过廉价盗版小说，书里除了反面人物和女投机商之外，所有的男人和女人都思想高尚、谈吐动听、举止优雅。简单地说，就像我承认太阳升起一样，我承认在我之上的一切都是美好、高尚和优雅的，这一切为生活赋予体面和尊严，这一切使人生值得度过，也是对一个人辛勤劳动和悲惨不幸的回报。","Above me towered the colossal edifice of society, and to my mind the only way out was up.Into this edifice I early resolved to climb.Up above, men wore black clothes and boiled shirts, and women dressed in beautiful gowns.Also, there were good things to eat, and there was plenty to eat.This much for the flesh.Then there were the things of the spirit.Up above me, I knew, were unselfishnesses of the spirit, clean and noble thinking, keen intellectual living.I knew all this because I read “Seaside Library” novels, in which, with the exception of the villains and adventuresses, all men and women thought beautiful thoughts, spoke a beautiful tongue, and performed glorious deeds.In short, as I accepted the rising of the sun, I accepted that up above me was all that was fine and noble and gracious, all that gave decency and dignity to life, all that made life worth living and that remunerated one for his travail and misery."
"但是，一个人要想爬出工人阶级跻身上流，可没那么容易——如果他还抱有理想和幻想，那就更难了。我生活在加利福尼亚州的一个大农场上，很难找到能借以攀爬的梯子。早先我曾咨询过股本的利率，还担心我这个智商不高的头脑是否能理解人类杰出发明——复利——的优点和长处。然后我又查明了各个年龄的工人们时下的工资率和生活费用。根据所有这些数据，我总结出，如果我立刻开始工作、攒钱，在我五十岁的时候，我就可以停止工作，加入到享受快乐和幸福的队伍中去，等我进入了较上层的社会，这一部分快乐和幸福就会向我敞开大门。当然，我下定决心不结婚，可是我却完全忘记了工人阶级的大麻烦——疾病。","But it is not particularly easy for one to climb up out of the working-class—especially if he is handicapped by the possession of ideals and illusions.I lived on a ranch in California, and was hard put to find the ladder whereby to climb.I early inquired the rate of interest on invested money, and worried my child’s brain into an understanding of the virtues and excellences of that remarkable invention of man, compound interest.Further, I ascertained the current rates of wages for workers of all ages, and the cost of living.From all this data I concluded that if I began immediately and worked and saved until I was fifty years of age, I could then stop working and enter into participation in a fair portion of the delights and goodnesses that would then be open to me higher up in society.Of course, I resolutely determined not to marry, while I quite forgot to consider at all that great rock of disaster in the working-class world—sickness."
"但是我所想的这种生活不仅仅要求我省吃俭用。而且，在我十岁的时候，我成了城市街头的一个报童，并且发现自己向上爬的观念改变了。我的周围依然是肮脏和苦难，在我之上依然是那个有待我得到的天堂，只是，借以攀爬的梯子不同了。如今的梯子是商业之梯。当我可以用五美分买下两份报纸，然后转手以十美分的价格卖出、让我的资本翻倍时，我为什么要把钱存起来去投资政府债券呢？商业之梯就是我要的梯子，我幻想自己将要变成一个成功的秃头商业王子。","But the life that was in me demanded more than a meagre existence of scraping and scrimping.Also, at ten years of age, I became a newsboy on the streets of a city, and found myself with a changed uplook.All about me were still the same sordidness and wretchedness, and up above me was still the same paradise waiting to be gained; but the ladder whereby to climb was a different one.It was now the ladder of business.Why save my earnings and invest in government bonds, when, by buying two newspapers for five cents, with a turn of the wrist I could sell them for ten cents and double my capital?The business ladder was the ladder for me, and I had a vision of myself becoming a bald-headed and successful merchant prince."
"唉，这只是幻想！在我十六岁的时候，我已经获得了“王子”的称号。但这称号是一群杀手和小偷给我起的，他们叫我“牡蛎海盗王子”。那时候，我已经爬到商业之梯的第一级台阶了。我成了一个资本家。我拥有一艘船和一整套掠夺牡蛎的装备。我开始剥削我的同类。我有一个船员。作为船长和船主，我拿了三分之二的战利品，留给船员三分之一，尽管他和我一样辛苦地工作，和我一样拿自己的生命和自由冒险。","Alas for visions!When I was sixteen I had already earned the title of “prince.”But this title was given me by a gang of cut-throats and thieves, by whom I was called “The Prince of the Oyster Pirates.”And at that time I had climbed the first rung of the business ladder.I was a capitalist.I owned a boat and a complete oyster-pirating outfit.I had begun to exploit my fellow-creatures.I had a crew of one man.As captain and owner I took two-thirds of the spoils, and gave the crew one-third, though the crew worked just as hard as I did and risked just as much his life and liberty."
"这就是我在商业之梯上爬的最高一级。一天晚上，我同一群中国渔夫去抢劫。绳子和渔网都是值钱货。这是抢劫，我承认，可这正是资本主义的精髓。资本家们以克扣的手段，或是背信弃义，或是收买参议员和高级法院的法官来抢夺自己同类的财产。我只是不加掩饰而已。那是唯一的区别。我用了枪。","This one rung was the height I climbed up the business ladder.One night I went on a raid amongst the Chinese fishermen.Ropes and nets were worth dollars and cents.It was robbery, I grant, but it was precisely the spirit of capitalism.The capitalist takes away the possessions of his fellow-creatures by means of a rebate, or of a betrayal of trust, or by the purchase of senators and supreme-court judges.I was merely crude.That was the only difference.I used a gun."
"但是那天晚上，我的船员效率极为低下，资本家多半是会严厉谴责的，因为效率低下的确会增加支出，减少分红。这两点我的船员都做到了。他不小心点着了船的大主帆，把它完全烧毁了。那晚没什么分红可得，而且那些中国渔夫比我们还富裕，因为他们抢了我们没能抢到的绳子和渔网。我破产了，那会儿连买新主帆的65美元都掏不出来。我把我的船抛了锚，和一艘海湾海盗船在萨克拉门托河上游抢劫去了。在我离开去抢劫的时候，另一伙海湾强盗抢劫了我的船。他们偷走了所有的东西，甚至包括锚；后来，我修好了漂浮的船体并把它卖了20美元。我又滑回到原来爬过的那级台阶，之后再也没有尝试过商业之梯。","But my crew that night was one of those inefficients against whom the capitalist is wont to fulminate, because, forsooth, such inefficients increase expenses and reduce dividends.My crew did both.What of his carelessness he set fire to the big mainsail and totally destroyed it.There weren’t any dividends that night, and the Chinese fishermen were richer by the nets and ropes we did not get.I was bankrupt, unable just then to pay sixty-five dollars for a new mainsail.I left my boat at anchor and went off on a bay-pirate boat on a raid up the Sacramento River.While away on this trip, another gang of bay pirates raided my boat.They stole everything, even the anchors; and later on, when I recovered the drifting hulk, I sold it for twenty dollars.I had slipped back the one rung I had climbed, and never again did I attempt the business ladder."
"之后，我被其他资本家们无情地剥削。我有力气，他们利用这点从中挣钱，而我却靠着力气过着非常惨淡的生活。我做过普通水手、码头装卸工人、舱面水手；我在罐头厂、制造厂和洗衣房工作过；我除过草、洗过地毯，还擦过玻璃。但我从未得到过辛苦劳动应有的报酬。我看着罐头厂主的女儿坐在她的四轮马车上，明白我的力气在某种程度上也帮助拉动车子的橡胶轮胎了。我看着制造厂厂主的儿子去上大学了，明白我的力气也在某种程度上支付了他所享有的美酒、换来了良好的人际关系。","From then on I was mercilessly exploited by other capitalists.I had the muscle, and they made money out of it while I made but a very indifferent living out of it.I was a sailor before the mast, a longshoreman, a roustabout; I worked in canneries, and factories, and laundries; I mowed lawns, and cleaned carpets, and washed windows.And I never got the full product of my toil.I looked at the daughter of the cannery owner, in her carriage, and knew that it was my muscle, in part, that helped drag along that carriage on its rubber tyres.I looked at the son of the factory owner, going to college, and knew that it was my muscle that helped, in part, to pay for the wine and good fellowship he enjoyed."
"可是我并不憎恨这一切。游戏就是如此。他们是强势群体。很好，我也很强壮。我会开辟出一条路使自己跻身于他们之中并从别人的力气中挣钱。我不害怕工作。我喜欢努力工作。我会比以前更投入、更努力地工作，最终成为社会的栋梁。","But I did not resent this.It was all in the game.They were the strong.Very well, I was strong.I would carve my way to a place amongst them and make money out of the muscles of other men.I was not afraid of work.I loved hard work.I would pitch in and work harder than ever and eventually become a pillar of society."
"就在这时，我很幸运地找到了一位和我想法一样的雇主。我乐意工作，而他也更乐意我工作。我以为我在学习做生意。实际上，我自己顶替了两个工人。我以为他在训练我成为一名电工；实际上，他每月从我身上榨取50美元。我顶替的那两个工人每人每月的薪水是40美元；我干他们两个人的活儿，每个月却只有30美元。","And just then, as luck would have it, I found an employer that was of the same mind.I was willing to work, and he was more than willing that I should work.I thought I was learning a trade.In reality, I had displaced two men.I thought he was making an electrician out of me; as a matter of fact, he was making fifty dollars per month out of me.The two men I had displaced had received forty dollars each per month; I was doing the work of both for thirty dollars per month."
"这个雇主让我过度工作，几乎把我累死。一个人也许很爱吃牡蛎，但是太多的牡蛎会让他对这种食物失去兴趣。我也一样。过度的工作让我心生厌恶。我再也不想看到工作了。我躲避工作。我成了一名流浪汉，挨家挨户地乞讨，在美利坚到处游走，在贫民窟和监狱中流着血汗。","This employer worked me nearly to death.A man may love oysters, but too many oysters will disincline him toward that particular diet.And so with me.Too much work sickened me.I did not wish ever to see work again.I fled from work.I became a tramp, begging my way from door to door, wandering over the United States and sweating bloody sweats in slums and prisons."
"我出生在工人阶级的家庭当中，而现在的我已经十八岁了，却生活在我的起点之下。我身在社会的地下室，在痛苦的深渊中，去谈论这种处境既不讨人喜欢也不合适。我处在陷阱、深渊、人类的污水池、屠宰场和人类文明的停尸房中。这是社会体系选择去遗忘的那部分。由于篇幅所限，我只能忽略这一点，我只能说在那里的所见给我留下了极大的恐惧。","I had been born in the working-class, and I was now, at the age of eighteen, beneath the point at which I had started.I was down in the cellar of society, down in the subterranean depths of misery about which it is neither nice nor proper to speak.I was in the pit, the abyss, the human cesspool, the shambles and the charnel-house of our civilization.This is the part of the edifice of society that society chooses to ignore.Lack of space compels me here to ignore it, and I shall say only that the things I there saw gave me a terrible scare."
"我不敢回想。我看到，我生活中的复杂文明被赤裸裸地简化了。生活就是关于食物和住所的问题。为了得到食物和住所，人们出卖东西。商人出卖鞋子，政客出卖他的人性，而人民的代表，当然也有例外，出卖别人对他的信任；而几乎所有人都出卖他们的荣誉。同样，女人们，无论是妓女还是受婚姻的神圣的束缚的女人，都很可能会出卖她们的肉体。一切都是商品，人人都在买卖。劳动者拥有的唯一能出卖的商品就是力气。劳动者的荣誉在市场上是没有价值的。劳动者有力气，也只有力气可以出售。","I was scared into thinking.I saw the naked simplicities of the complicated civilization in which I lived.Life was a matter of food and shelter.In order to get food and shelter men sold things.The merchant sold shoes, the politician sold his manhood, and the representative of the people, with exceptions, of course, sold his trust; while nearly all sold their honour.Women, too, whether on the street or in the holy bond of wedlock, were prone to sell their flesh.All things were commodities, all people bought and sold.The one commodity that labour had to sell was muscle.The honour of labour had no price in the marketplace.Labour had muscle, and muscle alone, to sell."
"但是这里有一点区别，很重要的一点区别。鞋子、信任和荣誉都有更新的习惯。他们是不会腐烂的储备物。相反，力气却无法更新。商人在卖鞋的同时，也在不断补充他的库存。可是没有办法去补充劳动者的力气。他的力气卖出得越多，留下的就越少。这是劳动者唯一的商品，而且每一天他的库存量都在减少。最后，如果他还没死去，他也已经卖光了所有的力气关门歇业了。他的力气耗尽了，一无所剩，他只能回到社会的地下室痛苦地死去。","But there was a difference, a vital difference.Shoes and trust and honour had a way of renewing themselves.They were imperishable stocks.Muscle, on the other hand, did not renew.As the shoe merchant sold shoes, he continued to replenish his stock.But there was no way of replenishing the labourer’s stock of muscle.The more he sold of his muscle, the less of it remained to him.It was his one commodity, and each day his stock of it diminished.In the end, if he did not die before, he sold out and put up his shutters.He was a muscle bankrupt, and nothing remained to him but to go down into the cellar of society and perish miserably."
"我还了解到，大脑也是一种商品。它也和力气不一样。脑力劳动者在五六十岁的时候才会达到他的黄金阶段，他的脑力也能卖比以前高很多的价钱。但是一个劳动者在四十五岁或是五十岁的时候就会被耗尽或是垮掉了。我曾经处在社会的地下室，而我不喜欢这个居所。管道和排水沟很不卫生，呼吸的空气也很差。如果我不能生活在社会的大厅里，不管怎么说，我都可以试一试阁楼。的确如此，那里的食物很少，但至少空气还是纯净的。所以我下定决心不再出卖力气而是去出卖脑力。","I learned, further, that brain was likewise a commodity.It, too, was different from muscle.A brain seller was only at his prime when he was fifty or sixty years old, and his wares were fetching higher prices than ever.But a labourer was worked out or broken down at forty-five or fifty.I had been in the cellar of society, and I did not like the place as a habitation.The pipes and drains were unsanitary, and the air was bad to breathe.If I could not live on the parlour floor of society, I could, at any rate, have a try at the attic.It was true, the diet there was slim, but the air at least was pure.So I resolved to sell no more muscle, and to become a vendor of brains."
"接着，我就开始对知识疯狂地追求。我回到加利福尼亚并开始看书。在我把自己训练成一名脑力出售者的时候，我不可避免地要研究社会学。在那特定的一类书中，我发现了系统阐述的一些简单的社会学概念，而这些我自己已经弄明白了。我还未出生时，其他更加伟大的思想家们已经弄懂了我所思考的一切，并且懂得要多得多。我发现自己是一名社会主义者。","Then began a frantic pursuit of knowledge.I returned to California and opened the books.While thus equipping myself to become a brain merchant, it was inevitable that I should delve into sociology.There I found, in a certain class of books, scientifically formulated, the simple sociological concepts I had already worked out for myself.Other and greater minds, before I was born, had worked out all that I had thought and a vast deal more.I discovered that I was a socialist."
"社会主义者是革命家，因为他们努力推翻现有的社会，并用原料建立一个未来的社会。我也是一名社会主义者和革命家。我加入到了工人阶级和睿智的革命家的队伍中，并且第一次加入到知识分子中。在这里我见到了许多机敏的英才和才华横溢的智者；因为在这里我见到了健壮、机警，而且满手硬茧的工人阶级成员，见到了在基督教教义上对任何拜金者聚会过于宽容、解除神职的传道士们，见到了由于反对大学对统治阶级卑躬屈膝而被车裂以及出言不逊的教授们，因为他们努力将自己熟悉的知识应用于人类事业。","The socialists were revolutionists, inasmuch as they struggled to overthrow the society of the present, and out of the material to build the society of the future.I, too, was a socialist and a revolutionist.I joined the groups of working-class and intellectual revolutionists, and for the first time came into intellectual living.Here I found keen-flashing intellects and brilliant wits; for here I met strong and alert-brained, withal horny-handed, members of the working-class; unfrocked preachers too wide in their Christianity for any congregation of Mammon-worshippers; professors broken on the wheel of university subservience to the ruling class and flung out because they were quick with knowledge which they strove to apply to the affairs of mankind."
"在这里我还看到了对人性温暖的信任、炽热的理想主义、美妙的无私精神、放弃和牺牲——所有优秀、尖锐的精神品质。这里的生命是干净、高尚和鲜活的。在这里，生活恢复到原状，变得奇妙而又辉煌，而我为自己活着而感到快乐。我和那些伟大的灵魂交流，他们把肉体和精神高举于金钱之上，对他们来说，饥饿的贫民窟儿童的微弱哭声比商业扩张和世界帝国的环境和辉煌更为重要。我周围都是崇高的目标和英勇的事迹，我的日日夜夜都是阳光灿烂、星光闪烁，充满火焰和雨露，在我的眼前，都和圣杯合基督教自己的圣杯熊熊燃烧、光芒四射，热情的人类，长期以来受尽折磨和虐待，但最终一定能获救。","Here I found, also, warm faith in the human, glowing idealism, sweetnesses of unselfishness, renunciation, and martyrdom—all the splendid, stinging things of the spirit.Here life was clean, noble, and alive.Here life rehabilitated itself, became wonderful and glorious; and I was glad to be alive.I was in touch with great souls who exalted flesh and spirit over dollars and cents, and to whom the thin wail of the starved slum child meant more than all the pomp and circumstance of commercial expansion and world empire.All about me were nobleness of purpose and heroism of effort, and my days and nights were sunshine and starshine, all fire and dew, with before my eyes, ever burning and blazing, the Holy Grail, Christ’s own Grail, the warm human, long-suffering and maltreated, but to be rescued and saved at the last."
"而我，贫穷愚蠢的我，认为这一切不过是我会在我之上的社会阶层中找到的快乐生活的一角。从我在加利福尼亚的大农场上阅读那些廉价小说的那天起，我就失去了很多幻想。我注定会失去更多我仍然保留的幻想。","And I, poor foolish I, deemed all this to be a mere foretaste of the delights of living I should find higher above me in society.I had lost many illusions since the day I read “Seaside Library” novels on the California ranch.I was destined to lose many of the illusions I still retained."
"作为一名脑力出售者，我是成功的。社会向我打开了大门。我刚进入社会的大厅，我的幻想就开始加速破灭。我同社会的统治者们坐下来共进晚餐，还有他们的妻子和女儿。我承认，女人们都穿得很漂亮；但是我太天真了，我惊讶地发现她们和我在社会地下室认识的所有其他女人是用同一种泥土做成的。“上校的妻子和朱迪·奥格雷迪是骨子里是一样的”——相同的还有礼服。","As a brain merchant I was a success.Society opened its portals to me.I entered right in on the parlour floor, and my disillusionment proceeded rapidly.I sat down to dinner with the masters of society, and with the wives and daughters of the masters of society.The women were gowned beautifully, I admit; but to my naive surprise I discovered that they were of the same clay as all the rest of the women I had known down below in the cellar.“The colonel’s lady and Judy O’Grady were sisters under their skins”—and gowns."
"然而，这却没有她们对物质的追求更让我震惊。真的，这些衣着亮丽的漂亮女人们闲聊着甜美的小理想，还有那可爱的小道德；尽管她们闲聊着这些内容，她们生活的主旋律还是追求物质享受。她们故作多情却又自私自利！她们支持各种形式的小规模的慈善事业，可要了解一个事实，她们一直以来吃的食物和穿的漂亮衣服都是用分红买来的，这些分红上沾满了童工、血汗劳工和卖淫行为本身的鲜血。当我提到这些事实时，天真地希望这些朱迪·奥格雷迪的姐妹们能立刻脱下和摘掉沾满鲜血的丝绸和珠宝，然而她们却变得很激动也很生气，对我说教道，是浪费、缺水和固有的剥削造成了社会地下室一切的痛苦。当我提到，我不能完全了解正是浪费、放纵和剥削年仅六岁没吃饱的孩子，使得南方棉花作坊能够每晚运转十二小时的时候，这些朱迪·奥格雷迪的姐妹们就攻击我的私人生活并叫我“鼓吹者”——好像这么做就能真的结束争辩似的。","It was not this, however, so much as their materialism, that shocked me.It is true, these beautifully gowned, beautiful women prattled sweet little ideals and dear little moralities; but in spite of their prattle the dominant key of the life they lived was materialistic.And they were so sentimentally selfish!They assisted in all kinds of sweet little charities, and informed one of the fact, while all the time the food they ate and the beautiful clothes they wore were bought out of dividends stained with the blood of child labour, and sweated labour, and of prostitution itself.When I mentioned such facts, expecting in my innocence that these sisters of Judy O’Grady would at once strip off their blood-dyed silks and jewels, they became excited and angry, and read me preachments about the lack of thrift, the drink, and the innate depravity that caused all the misery in society’s cellar.When I mentioned that I couldn’t quite see that it was the lack of thrift, the intemperance, and the depravity of a half-starved child of six that made it work twelve hours every night in a Southern cotton mill, these sisters of Judy O’Grady attacked my private life and called me an “agitator”—as though that, forsooth, settled the argument."
"我和那些统治者们相处得也不怎么样。我曾希望能找到一些纯洁、高尚和鲜活的人，他们的理想也是纯洁、高尚，和鲜活的。我在那些身处高位的人们中间奔走——传道士、政客、商人、教授和编辑。我同他们一起吃肉、一起喝酒、一起乘车，并研究他们。确实，我发现很多人是干净而高尚的，可很少有人是鲜活的。我十分确信我用十个指头就能数完例外的情况。他们不是生活在腐朽和肮脏中的活人，那里有的不过是没有被埋葬的死人——干净而高尚，就好像保存完好的木乃伊，可是没有生气。关于这一点，我得特别地提一提我遇见过的教授们，他们实践堕落的大学的理想，“对毫无感情的知识冷冰冰的追求”。","Nor did I fare better with the masters themselves.I had expected to find men who were clean, noble, and alive, whose ideals were clean, noble, and alive.I went about amongst the men who sat in the high places—the preachers, the politicians, the business men, the professors, and the editors.I ate meat with them, drank wine with them, automobiled with them, and studied them.It is true, I found many that were clean and noble; but with rare exceptions, they were not alive.I do verily believe I could count the exceptions on the fingers of my two hands.Where they were not alive with rottenness, quick with unclean life, there were merely the unburied dead—clean and noble, like well-preserved mummies, but not alive.In this connection I may especially mention the professors I met, the men who live up to that decadent university ideal, “the passionless pursuit of passionless intelligence.”"
"我认识一些人，他们在谴责战争时援引了和平王子的名字，却又把步枪交到私家侦探的手中，去射杀自己工厂里的罢工者。我看到一些人的行为前后不一，他们会因为奖牌争夺赛的残酷而愤怒，同时却又参与食物掺假，每年毒害的孩子的数量比满手鲜血的希律王杀死的还要多。","I met men who invoked the name of the Prince of Peace in their diatribes against war, and who put rifles in the hands of Pinkertons with which to shoot down strikers in their own factories.I met men incoherent with indignation at the brutality of prize-fighting, and who, at the same time, were parties to the adulteration of food that killed each year more babies than even red-handed Herod had killed."
"我在旅馆、俱乐部、家里、普尔曼卧车以及折叠式躺椅上和工业界的巨头们聊天，他们的学识如此浅薄让我感到非常惊讶。另一方面，我发现他们的商业头脑出奇地发达。我还发现他们完全没有商业道德。","I talked in hotels and clubs and homes and Pullmans, and steamer-chairs with captains of industry, and marvelled at how little travelled they were in the realm of intellect.On the other hand, I discovered that their intellect, in the business sense, was abnormally developed.Also, I discovered that their morality, where business was concerned, was nil."
"这位五官精致、有贵族气质的绅士是一家公司的傀儡董事和工具，那家公司做的是秘密抢劫寡妇和孤儿的勾当。这位绅士平时收集优良的版本，也是文学作品的特别赞助人，却也曾被一个为政府提供设施、长着很大的双下巴和黑眉毛的老板勒索过。这位编辑发行过专利医药广告，却不敢在报纸上说出关于该专利医药的实话，害怕失去这个广告。他称我为卑鄙无耻的煽动者，因为我告诉他他的政治经济观已经落后了，他的生物学观点和普利尼是一个时代的。","This delicate, aristocratic-featured gentleman, was a dummy director and a tool of corporations that secretly robbed widows and orphans.This gentleman, who collected fine editions and was an especial patron of literature, paid blackmail to a heavy-jowled, black-browed boss of a municipal machine.This editor, who published patent medicine advertisements and did not dare print the truth in his paper about said patent medicines for fear of losing the advertising, called me a scoundrelly demagogue because I told him that his political economy was antiquated and that his biology was contemporaneous with Pliny."
"这位参议员是一位肥胖的、未受过教育的、做机器生意的老板的工具、奴隶和小木偶；这位州长和这位高级法院的法官也一样；还有那三个在铁路通道工作的人。这个人冷静而认真地谈论着理想的妙处和上帝的善良，刚刚却在生意中背叛了自己的同事。这个人是教会的中坚力量，并为对外传教的事业做出很大的贡献，却让自己商铺里的姑娘们每天工作十个小时，工资少得可怜，从而直接刺激了卖淫的泛滥。这个人，向大学捐献椅子，却在一件财产纠纷案中作伪证。这位铁轨大亨曾许诺向两位争得你死我活的工业主中的一位提供秘密折扣，但作为一位绅士和基督徒他却没有遵守他的诺言。","This senator was the tool and the slave, the little puppet of a gross, uneducated machine boss; so was this governor and this supreme court judge; and all three rode on railroad passes.This man, talking soberly and earnestly about the beauties of idealism and the goodness of God, had just betrayed his comrades in a business deal.This man, a pillar of the church and heavy contributor to foreign missions, worked his shop girls ten hours a day on a starvation wage and thereby directly encouraged prostitution.This man, who endowed chairs in universities, perjured himself in courts of law over a matter of dollars and cents.And this railroad magnate broke his word as a gentleman and a Christian when he granted a secret rebate to one of two captains of industry locked together in a struggle to the death."
"哪里都是一样，罪恶和背叛，背叛和罪恶——鲜活的人却既不干净也不高尚，而干净高尚的人却没有生气。还有一大群无可救药的人们，既不高尚也没有生气，只是干净而已。他确实既没有主动犯罪也不是故意犯罪；但是他的确是被动而无知地犯了罪，他默认现有的不道德并从中获利。如果他是高尚而鲜活的，他就不会无知，也会拒绝分享背叛和罪恶所获得的利益了。","It was the same everywhere, crime and betrayal, betrayal and crime—men who were alive, but who were neither clean nor noble, men who were clean and noble, but who were not alive.Then there was a great, hopeless mass, neither noble nor alive, but merely clean.It did not sin positively nor deliberately; but it did sin passively and ignorantly by acquiescing in the current immorality and profiting by it.Had it been noble and alive it would not have been ignorant, and it would have refused to share in the profits of betrayal and crime."
"我发现自己并不喜欢呆在社会的大厅。在智力上，我感到同样很乏味。在道德和精神上，我都心生厌恶。我想起我认识的知识分子和理想家们，解除神职的传道者们，被肢解的教授们，心灵纯净、有阶级意识的工人们。我记得我在阳光和星光下的日日夜夜，那里的生活自在、甜蜜而美好，是无私冒险和道德传奇的精神天堂。在我面前，我还看到一直熊熊燃烧、光芒四射的圣杯。","I discovered that I did not like to live on the parlour floor of society.Intellectually I was as bored.Morally and spiritually I was sickened.I remembered my intellectuals and idealists, my unfrocked preachers, broken professors, and clean-minded, class-conscious working-men.I remembered my days and nights of sunshine and starshine, where life was all a wild sweet wonder, a spiritual paradise of unselfish adventure and ethical romance.And I saw before me, ever blazing and burning, the Holy Grail."
"所以，我又回到了工人阶级中去，我出生于这个阶级，归属于这个阶级。我再也不想往上爬了。在我头上雄伟的社会体系对我毫无乐趣可言。我感兴趣的是这个体系的基础。在那里我愉快地劳动，手拿撬棍，同知识分子、理想家和有阶级意识的工人肩并肩，不时地拿一根结实的杠杆去撼动整个社会体系的基石。终有一天，当我们拥有更多的帮手和更多的撬棍时，我们会将其推翻，连同一切腐朽的生活和活死人，可恶的自私自利和浸透的物质主义。那时我们会清理地下室，为人类建设一个新的家园，在那里没有什么大厅，所有的房间都是又明亮又通风的，呼吸的空气是干净、高尚和鲜活的。","So I went back to the working-class, in which I had been born and where I belonged.I care no longer to climb.The imposing edifice of society above my head holds no delights for me.It is the foundation of the edifice that interests me.There I am content to labour, crowbar in hand, shoulder to shoulder with intellectuals, idealists, and class-conscious working-men, getting a solid pry now and again and setting the whole edifice rocking.Some day, when we get a few more hands and crowbars to work, we’ll topple it over, along with all its rotten life and unburied dead, its monstrous selfishness and sodden materialism.Then we’ll cleanse the cellar and build a new habitation for mankind, in which there will be no parlour floor, in which all the rooms will be bright and airy, and where the air that is breathed will be clean, noble, and alive."
"这就是我的想法。我期待这样一个时代，那时人们会在比胃口更有价值、更高尚的事情上取得进步，那时会有一种比现在这种仅仅为了填饱肚子的更好的动力鼓舞人们去工作。我对人类的高尚和优秀保有信心。我相信精神上的愉悦和无私将会战胜今日巨大的贪食欲望。最后，我对工人阶级充满信心。正如某位法国人所说：“时代的楼梯上永远回荡着木鞋上台阶和光亮的靴子下台阶的声音”。","Such is my outlook.I look forward to a time when man shall progress upon something worthier and higher than his stomach, when there will be a finer incentive to impel men to action than the incentive of today, which is the incentive of the stomach.I retain my belief in the nobility and excellence of the human.I believe that spiritual sweetness and unselfishness will conquer the gross gluttony of today.And last of all, my faith is in the working-class.As some Frenchman has said, “The stairway of time is ever echoing with the wooden shoe going up, the polished boot descending.”"
