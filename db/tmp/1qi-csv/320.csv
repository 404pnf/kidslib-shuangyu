"陌生人 ","The Stranger"
"作者：曼斯菲尔德","by Katherine Mansfield"
"在码头上的这一小群人看来，那艘船永远都不会再动了。巨大的她停在泛着波纹的灰色的海面上，纹丝不动。一道烟盘旋在她上空，一大群海鸥高声鸣叫，在船尾俯冲下来追逐着船上厨房倾倒出来的东西。你只能看到船上有三三两两的人在溜达——就像在皱皱巴巴的灰色桌布上的盘子，几只小小的苍蝇在爬来爬去。其他一些则三个一堆、两个一伙地聚在船边。时而有一抹白色在船的下层一闪而过——那可能是厨师的围裙或船上的女服务员。时而有一个小蜘蛛似的黑影快速地从舷梯跑到舰桥上。","It seemed to the little crowd on the wharf that she was never going to move again.There she lay, immense, motionless on the grey crinkled water, a loop of smoke above her, an immense flock of gulls screaming and diving after the galley droppings at the stern.You could just see little couples parading—little flies walking up and down the dish on the grey crinkled tablecloth.Other flies clustered and swarmed at the edge.Now there was a gleam of white on the lower deck—the cook’s apron or the stewardess perhaps.Now a tiny black spider raced up the ladder on to the bridge."
"岸上那一群人的前面有一个看起来很强壮的中年人，他穿着讲究：一件舒适的灰大衣、一条灰色的真丝围巾、厚厚的手套、深色的毡帽。他一边来来回回地走，一边快速转动着一把合着的伞。他看起来像是码头上这一小群人的头儿，同时也是他把他们召集在一起。他是介于牧羊犬与牧羊人之间的那么一个角色。","In the front of the crowd a strong-looking, middle-aged man, dressed very well, very snugly in a grey overcoat, grey silk scarf, thick gloves and dark felt hat, marched up and down, twirling his folded umbrella.He seemed to be the leader of the little crowd on the wharf and at the same time to keep them together.He was something between the sheep-dog and the shepherd."
"但是他多傻呀——傻得竟不知道带副望远镜来。他们这么多人竟连一副望远镜都没带。","But what a fool—what a fool he had been not to bring any glasses!There wasn’t a pair of glasses between the whole lot of them."
"“真怪了，斯科特先生，咱们怎么就没有一个人想起带副望远镜呢。我们原本能让他们更兴奋一点的。我们原本可以设法给他们发发信号。‘不要犹豫，速速登陆。本地居民毫无恶意。’或：‘热烈欢迎各位。我们既往不咎。’如何？嗯？”","“Curious thing, Mr. Scott, that none of us thought of glasses.We might have been able to stir ’em up a bit.We might have managed a little signalling.‘Don’t hesitate to land.Natives harmless.’Or: ‘A welcome awaits you.All is forgiven.’What?Eh?”"
"哈蒙德先生迅速、急切地瞥了一眼，那么紧张却又那么满怀友好和信任。这一眼将码头上的每个人都看在眼里，连倚在舷梯上的那几位老兄都没错过。他们每个人都知道，哈蒙德夫人就在那艘船上，而且也知道哈蒙德先生那么兴奋，他脑子里根本就没有想过，这件对他来说了不得的大事对他们来说是否也一样意义重大。正因为如此，他一想起他们心里就热乎乎的。他决定当他们是一群体面人——舷梯旁边的那些老家伙也是——都是健康结实的好兄弟。他们的胸脯多么——啊！于是他挺了挺自己的胸脯，将戴着厚厚的手套的手插进衣兜里，从脚跟到脚尖前后晃动起来。","Mr. Hammond’s quick, eager glance, so nervous and yet so friendly and confiding, took in everybody on the wharf, roped in even those old chaps lounging against the gangways.They knew, every man-jack of them, that Mrs. Hammond was on that boat, and that he was so tremendously excited it never entered his head not to believe that this marvellous fact meant something to them too.It warmed his heart towards them.They were, he decided, as decent a crowd of people—Those old chaps over by the gangways, too—fine, solid old chaps.What chests—by Jove!And he squared his own, plunged his thick-gloved hands into his pockets, rocked from heel to toe."
"“是啊，过去十个月我太太一直呆在欧洲。她去看我们去年刚嫁过去的大女儿。我大老远亲自把她送到索尔兹伯里。所以我想我最好还是来把她接回去。是的，是的，是的。”那双精明的灰眼睛又眯起来，焦急地、快速地搜寻着那一动不动的客轮。他的大衣扣子又一次被解开。那块薄薄的、黄油色的怀表又一次被掏出来，他第二十次——五十次——甚至一百次计算起时间来。","“Yes, my wife’s been in Europe for the last ten months.On a visit to our eldest girl, who was married last year.I brought her up here, as far as Salisbury, myself.So I thought I’d better come and fetch her back.Yes, yes, yes.”The shrewd grey eyes narrowed again and searched anxiously, quickly, the motionless liner.Again his overcoat was unbuttoned.Out came the thin, butter-yellow watch again, and for the twentieth—fiftieth—hundredth time he made the calculation."
"“现在让我想想。大夫的船离岸出发时是两点十五分。两点十五分。现在正好是四点二十八分。也就是说大夫已经走了两个小时零十三分钟了。两个小时零十三分钟啊！哟——嗬！”他发出了像口哨似的怪声，然后又啪的一声合上怀表。“不过我觉得要是有什么事的话他们早就告诉我们了——你说呢，加文先生？”","“Let me see now.It was two fifteen when the doctor’s launch went off.Two fifteen.It is now exactly twenty-eight minutes past four.That is to say, the doctor’s been gone two hours and thirteen minutes.Two hours and thirteen minutes!Whee—ooh!”He gave a queer little half-whistle and snapped his watch to again.“But I think we should have been told if there was anything up—don’t you, Mr. Gaven?”"
"“哦，是的，哈蒙德先生！我认为没什么事——没什么可担心的。”加文先生一边说一边在他的鞋跟上磕了磕烟斗。“同时——”","“Oh, yes, Mr. Hammond!I don’t think there’s anything to—anything to worry about,” said Mr. Gaven, knocking out his pipe against the heel of his shoe.“At the same time—”"
"“没错！没错！”哈蒙德先生喊道。“烦死了！”他来来回回地快速踱着步，然后又回到斯科特夫妇和加文先生之间他原先站的地方。“天都这么黑了，”他挥舞着他那把合在一起的伞，仿佛黄昏至少应该把夜幕降临的时间再推迟一会儿。然而黄昏还是施施然地到来了，如同一点污渍慢慢地在水中晕染开来。小琼· 斯科特拽着她妈妈的手。","“Quite so!Quite so!” cried Mr. Hammond.“Dashed annoying!”He paced quickly up and down and came back again to his stand between Mr. and Mrs. Scott and Mr. Gaven.“It’s getting quite dark, too,” and he waved his folded umbrella as though the dusk at least might have had the decency to keep off for a bit.But the dusk came slowly, spreading like a slow stain over the water.Little Jean Scott dragged at her mother’s hand."
"“我要吃茶点，妈妈！”她哭喊着。","“I wan’ my tea, mammy!” she wailed."
"“我知道你该吃了。”哈蒙德先生说道。“我知道这儿所有的女士都想吃了。”接着他那仁慈的、兴奋的、又近乎怜悯的目光把他们在场所有的人又扫视一番。他想知道船上的珍妮此时是否正在大厅里喝最后一杯茶。他希望如此，不过他认为不会。呆在甲板上不离开才像是她的风格。那样的话，可能船上的服务员会给她拿一杯茶。如果他在那儿，他会给她拿一杯——不管怎样都会。有那么一刻他好像到了船上，就站在她的身边，注视着她的小手以她特有的方式拿着茶杯，喝着他给她弄到的船上唯一一杯茶……可现在他又回到了岸上，而且只有上帝知道那个倒霉的船长什么时候才能不再在那个小河沟里磨蹭了。他又踱起步来，来来回回，来来回回。他一直走到停出租马车的地方去确定一下司机没有偷偷溜走，突然他又掉头回到那一小群挤在装香蕉的货箱里的人中。小琼·斯科特还在要茶点吃。可怜的小东西！他真希望他身上能有点巧克力。","“I expect you do,” said Mr. Hammond.“I expect all these ladies want their tea.”And his kind, flushed, almost pitiful glance roped them all in again.He wondered whether Janey was having a final cup of tea in the saloon out there.He hoped so; he thought not.It would be just like her not to leave the deck.In that case perhaps the deck steward would bring her up a cup.If he’d been there he’d have got it for her—somehow.And for a moment he was on deck, standing over her, watching her little hand fold round the cup in the way she had, while she drank the only cup of tea to be got on board... But now he was back here, and the Lord only knew when that cursed Captain would stop hanging about in the stream.He took another turn, up and down, up and down.He walked as far as the cab-stand to make sure his driver hadn’t disappeared; back he swerved again to the little flock huddled in the shelter of the banana crates.Little Jean Scott was still wanting her tea.Poor little beggar!He wished he had a bit of chocolate on him."
"“来呀，琼。”他说着，“喜欢举个高高吗？”然后他不费吹灰之力就轻柔地把小姑娘荡到一个更高的木桶上。抱着她、放稳她的动作神奇纾解了他的紧张情绪，令他的心情轻松起来。","“Here, Jean!” he said.“Like a lift up?”And easily, gently, he swung the little girl on to a higher barrel.The movement of holding her, steadying her, relieved him wonderfully, lightened his heart."
"“站稳了。”他边说边用一只胳膊搂着她。","“Hold on,” he said, keeping an arm round her."
"“噢，别为琼担心了，哈蒙德先生”斯科特夫人说。","“Oh, don’t worry about Jean, Mr. Hammond!” said Mrs. Scott."
"“没事，斯科特夫人。不麻烦。挺好玩的。琼是我的小朋友，是不是呀，琼？”","“That’s all right, Mrs. Scott.No trouble.It’s a pleasure.Jean’s a little pal of mine, aren’t you, Jean?”"
"“是的，哈蒙德先生。”琼说着，手指沿着他毡帽上的凹陷处划着。","“Yes, Mr. Hammond,” said Jean, and she ran her finger down the dent of his felt hat."
"可是突然她拽住他的一只耳朵尖叫了一声。“看——看呀，哈蒙德先生！她在动呢！看，她正在往里进！”","But suddenly she caught him by the ear and gave a loud scream.“Lo—ok, Mr. Hammond!She’s moving!Look, she’s coming in!”"
"我的天！她确实在动。终于动了！她正慢慢地、慢慢地掉头。一阵铃声远远地从水面上传过来，一大股蒸汽猛地喷向天空。海鸥飞了起来，它们拍打着翅膀飞走了，像一张张白色的纸片。哈蒙德先生说不清楚到底是船上的发动机，还是他自己的心脏在怦怦地跳。不管是什么，他都必须鼓起勇气来忍住。正在这时，老约翰逊船长，现任的港务长昂首阔步地沿着码头走来，腋下夹着一个皮公文包。","By Jove!So she was.At last!She was slowly, slowly turning round.A bell sounded far over the water and a great spout of steam gushed into the air.The gulls rose; they fluttered away like bits of white paper.And whether that deep throbbing was her engines or his heart Mr. Hammond couldn’t say.He had to nerve himself to bear it, whatever it was.At that moment old Captain Johnson, the harbour-master, came striding down the wharf, a leather portfolio under his arm."
"“琼一会儿就没事了。”斯科特先生说。“我来扶着她吧。”他简直就是及时雨。哈蒙德先生早把琼要茶点的事给忘了。他已跑开去和老约翰逊船长寒暄起来。","“Jean’ll be all right,” said Mr. Scott.“I’ll hold her.”He was just in time.Mr. Hammond had forgotten about Jean.He sprang away to greet old Captain Johnson."
"“哎呀，船长，”他那迫切、紧张的声音又响起来，“您终于对我们大发慈悲了。”","“Well, Captain,” the eager, nervous voice rang out again, “you’ve taken pity on us at last.”"
"“责怪我没用，哈蒙德先生。”老约翰逊船长一边盯着客轮，一边气喘吁吁地说。“你家哈蒙德太太在船上，是吧？”","“It’s no good blaming me, Mr. Hammond,” wheezed old Captain Johnson, staring at the liner.“You got Mrs. Hammond on board, ain’t yer?”"
"“是啊，是啊！”哈蒙德先生说完，就守在这位港务长的旁边。“哈蒙德太太在上面呢。喂——喂！现在我们很快就能见着了！”","“Yes, yes!” said Hammond, and he kept by the harbour-master’s side.“Mrs. Hammond’s there.Hul—lo!We shan’t be long now!”"
"随着船上电话铃声大作，螺旋桨击水声充斥在空气中，大船划开黑沉沉的海水向他们迎面开来，带起巨大的白色浪花向两边翻卷。哈蒙德和港务长一直站在其他人前面。哈蒙德摘下帽子；目光在一层层甲板间扫视着——每层甲板都挤满了旅客；他挥舞着他的帽子，隔着水用奇怪的声音大叫了一声“哈——罗！”然后转过身来向着老约翰逊船长大笑着——不知所云地说着什么。","With her telephone ring-ringing, the thrum of her screw filling the air, the big liner bore down on them, cutting sharp through the dark water so that big white shavings curled to either side.Hammond and the harbour-master kept in front of the rest.Hammond took off his hat; he raked the decks—they were crammed with passengers; he waved his hat and bawled a loud, strange “Hul—lo!” across the water;and then turned round and burst out laughing and said something—nothing—to old Captain Johnson."
"“看到她了？”港务长问道。","“Seen her?” asked the harbour-master."
"“没，还没呢。不着急——等一等！”突然，在两个大笨蛋之间响起——“走开！”他用伞比划了一下——他看见一只手举了起来，那只戴着白手套的手正摇着一条手绢。下一刻，噢——感谢上帝，感谢上帝——她在那儿。珍妮在那儿。是哈蒙德太太，是她，是她，就是她——她正站在栏杆旁边，点着头、微笑着、挥动着手绢。","“No, not yet.Steady—wait a bit!”And suddenly, between two great clumsy idiots—“Get out of the way there!”he signed with his umbrella—he saw a hand raised—a white glove shaking a handkerchief.Another moment, and—thank God, thank God!—there she was.There was Janey.There was Mrs. Hammond, yes, yes, yes—standing by the rail and smiling and nodding and waving her handkerchief."
"“好啦，那是头等舱——头等！好啦，好啦，好啦！”他确定地跺着脚。他闪电般地拿出雪茄烟盒递给老约翰逊船长。“抽支雪茄，船长！味道相当好。来两支！都给你吧”——接着他把烟盒里所有的雪茄都给了港务长——“我在旅馆还有好几盒呢！”","“Well that’s first class—first class!Well, well, well!”He positively stamped.Like lightning he drew out his cigar-case and offered it to old Captain Johnson.“Have a cigar, Captain!They’re pretty good.Have a couple!Here”—and he pressed all the cigars in the case on the harbour-master—“I’ve a couple of boxes up at the hotel.”"
"“谢了，哈蒙德先生！”老约翰逊船长气喘吁吁地说。","“Thenks, Mr. Hammond!” wheezed old Captain Johnson."
"哈蒙德先生把烟盒揣了回去。他双手颤抖着，不过他又控制住了自己。他可以面对面地看到珍妮了。她就在那儿，倚着栏杆和某位女士交谈，一边还注视着他，准备着和他团聚。随着分开他们的鸿沟逐渐弥合，他突然觉得巨轮上的她看起来好小啊。他的心绞了一下，疼得他几乎喊出声来。她看起来是多么小啊，却独自走了那么远的路回来了！然而这样才正像她。正像珍妮。她的勇气如一个——现在水手们走过来把旅客们分开，他们把栏杆放低以便搭舷梯。","Hammond stuffed the cigar-case back.His hands were shaking, but he’d got hold of himself again.He was able to face Janey.There she was, leaning on the rail, talking to some woman and at the same time watching him, ready for him.It struck him, as the gulf of water closed, how small she looked on that huge ship.His heart was wrung with such a spasm that he could have cried out.How little she looked to have come all that long way and back by herself!Just like her, though.Just like Janey.She had the courage of a—And now the crew had come forward and parted the passengers; they had lowered the rails for the gangways."
"岸上和船上互致问候的声音飘向对方。","The voices on shore and the voices on board flew to greet each other."
"“都好吧？”","“All well?”"
"“都好。”","“All well.”"
"“妈妈好吗？”","“How’s mother?”"
"“好多了。”","“Much better.”"
"“你好，琼！”","“Hullo, Jean!”"
"“你好，埃米莉姑姑！”","“Hillo, Aun’ Emily!”"
"“旅途愉快吗？”","“Had a good voyage?”"
"“好极了！”","“Splendid!”"
"“现在快到了！”","“Shan’t be long now!”"
"“快了。”","“Not long now.”"
"发动机停了。船的一侧慢慢靠向码头。","The engines stopped.Slowly she edged to the wharf-side."
"“那边让一下——让让——让让！”码头工人一路跑着把重重的舷梯拉过来。哈蒙德示意珍妮呆在原处别动。老港务长往前走，他紧随其后。至于“女士优先”之类的废话他想都没想。","“Make way there—make way—make way!”And the wharf hands brought the heavy gangways along at a sweeping run.Hammond signed to Janey to stay where she was.The old harbour-master stepped forward; he followed.As to “ladies first,” or any rot like that, it never entered his head."
"“您先请，船长！”他和气地喊着。然后他紧跟在老人的后面，大步走上舷梯，登上甲板，直奔珍妮，接着珍妮就被他紧紧抱在了怀里。","“After you, Captain!” he cried genially.And, treading on the old man’s heels, he strode up the gangway on to the deck in a bee-line to Janey, and Janey was clasped in his arms."
"“好啦，好啦，好啦！是的，是的！我们终于在一起了！”他结结巴巴地说。他就只能说出这些。珍妮从他怀里出来，用她清冷的、细声细气的声音——对他来说却是世上唯一的天籁——说道：","“Well, well, well!Yes, yes!Here we are at last!” he stammered.It was all he could say.And Janey emerged, and her cool little voice—the only voice in the world for him—said,"
"“好啦，亲爱的！让你久等了吧？”","“Well, darling!Have you been waiting long?”"
"没，没多久。或者说，不管怎么样，那都不重要了。现在都已经结束了。但重要的是，他让一辆出租马车在码头那头等着。她准备好下船了吗？她的行李收拾好了吗？那样的话，他们可以立刻带着船舱里的行李离开，其余的东西留在船上明天再说。他向她俯下身，而她则用她惯常的似笑非笑的表情抬头看着他。她还是老样子。她一点都没变。正是他所熟知的模样。她把她的小手放在他的袖子上。","No; not long.Or, at any rate, it didn’t matter.It was over now.But the point was, he had a cab waiting at the end of the wharf.Was she ready to go off.Was her luggage ready?In that case they could cut off sharp with her cabin luggage and let the rest go hang until tomorrow.He bent over her and she looked up with her familiar half-smile.She was just the same.Not a day changed.Just as he’d always known her.She laid her small hand on his sleeve."
"“孩子们好吗，约翰？”她问。","“How are the children, John?” she asked."
"（该死的孩子！）“非常好。他们长这么大从没这么好过。”","(Hang the children!) “Perfectly well.Never better in their lives.”"
"“他们没给我写信吗？”","“Haven’t they sent me letters?”"
"“写了，写了——当然写了！我把它们放在旅馆里等稍后你慢慢读。”","“Yes, yes—of course!I’ve left them at the hotel for you to digest later on.”"
"“我们走不了那么快。”她说，“我还有人要告别呢——还有船长。”当他的脸色沉了下来，她体谅地在他胳膊上轻轻捏了一下。“如果船长从舰桥上下来，我希望你能谢谢他把你太太照顾得这么好。”好吧，他已经接到她了。如果她想再呆十分钟——他一让开，她就被包围了。看起来整个头等舱的人都来和珍妮告别来了。","“We can’t go quite so fast,” said she.“I’ve got people to say good-bye to—and then there’s the Captain.”As his face fell she gave his arm a small understanding squeeze.“If the Captain comes off the bridge I want you to thank him for having looked after your wife so beautifully.”Well, he’d got her.If she wanted another ten minutes—As he gave way she was surrounded.The whole first-class seemed to want to say good-bye to Janey."
"“再见了，亲爱的哈蒙德太太！下一次您到悉尼来，我一定恭候您的大驾。”","“Good-bye, dear Mrs. Hammond!And next time you’re in Sydney I’ll expect you.”"
"“亲爱的哈蒙德太太！你一定不会忘了给我写信的，是吧？”","“Darling Mrs. Hammond!You won’t forget to write to me, will you?”"
"“哎呀，哈蒙德太太，如果没有你，在船上的这些日子会是什么样子啊！”","“Well, Mrs. Hammond, what this boat would have been without you!”"
"显而易见，她是船上最受欢迎的女人。而她和以往一样——对这些照单全收。她极其镇定。正是小小的她——如假包换的珍妮，站在那儿，她的面纱向后扬起。哈蒙德从没注意过自己妻子的穿着。对于他来说，无论她穿什么都一样美。可是今天他的确注意到了，她穿了一件黑色的“服装”——她们不都这么叫它吗？———在领口和袖口镶有白色的荷叶边，他认为那些叫花边。在这整个期间，珍妮一直为他作介绍。","It was as plain as a pikestaff that she was by far the most popular woman on board.And she took it all—just as usual.Absolutely composed.Just her little self—just Janey all over; standing there with her veil thrown back.Hammond never noticed what his wife had on.It was all the same to him whatever she wore.But today he did notice that she wore a black “costume”—didn’t they call it?—with white frills, trimmings he supposed they were, at the neck and sleeves.All this while Janey handed him round."
"“约翰，亲爱的！”然后接下来是：“我想介绍你认识——”","“John, dear!”And then: “I want to introduce you to—”"
"最后，他们终于逃出来，她领他来到她的特等客舱。跟着珍妮走过那条她非常熟悉的过道——他对此却那么陌生；在她后面掀开绿色的帘子，走进一直属于她的客舱，这给了他强烈的幸福感。可是——真扫兴！——船上的女服务员正在地板上捆毯子。","Finally they did escape, and she led the way to her state-room.To follow Janey down the passage that she knew so well—that was so strange to him; to part the green curtains after her and to step into the cabin that had been hers gave him exquisite happiness.But—confound it!—the stewardess was there on the floor, strapping up the rugs."
"“这是最后一件了，哈蒙德太太。”女服务员说着，站起来拉下袖口。","“That’s the last, Mrs. Hammond,” said the stewardess, rising and pulling down her cuffs."
"他又被介绍了一遍，然后珍妮和女服务员就消失在过道里。他听到她们小声说着什么。他想她正在结清小费。他在带条纹的沙发上坐下来，摘下帽子。有几块她随身携带的毯子，它们看起来像新的一样。她所有的行李看起来都是崭新的、完好无缺的。标签上是她用小小的漂亮清晰的字体写的——“约翰·哈蒙德太太。”","He was introduced again, and then Janey and the stewardess disappeared into the passage.He heard whisperings.She was getting the tipping business over, he supposed.He sat down on the striped sofa and took his hat off.There were the rugs she had taken with her; they looked good as new.All her luggage looked fresh, perfect.The labels were written in her beautiful little clear hand—“Mrs. John Hammond.”"
"“约翰·哈蒙德太太！”他心满意足地长吁了一口气，交叉双臂向后倚去。那种紧张感消失了。他觉得他简直可以永远坐在这儿感叹他的解脱——从那种撕心裂肺的可怕的感觉中摆脱出来。危险已然过去。就是这种感觉。他们又在陆地上了。","“Mrs. John Hammond!”He gave a long sigh of content and leaned back, crossing his arms.The strain was over.He felt he could have sat there for ever sighing his relief—the relief at being rid of that horrible tug, pull, grip on his heart.The danger was over.That was the feeling.They were on dry land again."
"但正在这时，珍妮的脑袋从拐角处探出来。","But at that moment Janey’s head came round the corner."
"“亲爱的——你介不介意？我只是想去和医生告个别。”","“Darling—do you mind?I just want to go and say good-bye to the doctor.”"
"哈蒙德先生一跃而起。“我和你一起去。”","Hammond started up.“I’ll come with you.”"
"“不，不用！”她说。“不用麻烦了。我不想让你去。我一分钟都用不了。”","“No, no!” she said.“Don’t bother.I’d rather not.I’ll not be a minute.”"
"他还没来得及回答，她就走了。他有点想去追她，不过他反倒又坐下了。","And before he could answer she was gone.He had half a mind to run after her; but instead he sat down again."
"她真的用不了多长时间吗？现在几点了？他又掏出表，却视若无睹。珍妮的行为非常古怪，不是吗？为什么她不让服务员替她道别呢？为什么她非得追着去和随船医生告别呢？即使有什么紧急的事，她完全可以从旅馆送个便条。紧急的事？那意味着——那可能意味着她在旅途中生过病——她有什么事情瞒着他吗？就是这么回事！他抓起他的帽子。他要去找到那个家伙，不惜任何代价也要把真相从他那里挖出来。他想他已经注意到的只是蛛丝马迹。她就是有点太冷静了——太沉着了。从最初那一刻开始——","Would she really not be long?What was the time now?Out came the watch; he stared at nothing.That was rather queer of Janey, wasn’t it?Why couldn’t she have told the stewardess to say good-bye for her?Why did she have to go chasing after the ship’s doctor?She could have sent a note from the hotel even if the affair had been urgent.Urgent?Did it—could it mean that she had been ill on the voyage—she was keeping something from him?That was it!He seized his hat.He was going off to find that fellow and to wring the truth out of him at all costs.He thought he’d noticed just something.She was just a touch too calm—too steady.From the very first moment—"
"门帘响了一下。珍妮回来了。他跳了起来。","The curtains rang.Janey was back.He jumped to his feet."
"“珍妮，你在旅途中生病了吗？你肯定生病了！”","“Janey, have you been ill on this voyage?You have!”"
"“病了？”她嗓音轻柔地、漫不经心地嘲笑着他。跨过那些毯子，她走上前来，抚摸他的胸脯，抬头看着他。","“Ill?”Her airy little voice mocked him.She stepped over the rugs, and came up close, touched his breast, and looked up at him."
"“亲爱的，”她说，“别吓我了。我当然没生病了！到底是什么让你以为我生病了？我看起来像有病的样子吗？”","“Darling,” she said, “don’t frighten me.Of course I haven’t!Whatever makes you think I have?Do I look ill?”"
"可是哈蒙德不看她。他只是觉得她正看着他，并没必要去担心任何事。她在这儿是为了处理一些事情。没什么事。一切正常。","But Hammond didn’t see her.He only felt that she was looking at him and that there was no need to worry about anything.She was here to look after things.It was all right.Everything was."
"她的手轻轻地压在那儿就让他如此地镇静，以至于他把自己的手放上去，牢牢地让它放在那儿。接着她说：","The gentle pressure of her hand was so calming that he put his over hers to hold it there.And she said:"
"“别动。我想看看你。我还没好好地看看你呢。你的胡子修得很漂亮，而且你看起来——更年轻了，我想，你肯定瘦了一些！单身生活挺适合你的。”","“Stand still.I want to look at you.I haven’t seen you yet.You’ve had your beard beautifully trimmed, and you look—younger, I think, and decidedly thinner!Bachelor life agrees with you.”"
"“适合我！”他满怀柔情地呻吟了一声，又把她抱紧了。然后又一次，和以往一样，那种感觉又来了：他正抱着一件从未完全属于他的东西——只属于他的。这件东西太娇弱、太珍贵了，只要他一撒手它就会飞走。","“Agrees with me!”He groaned for love and caught her close again.And again, as always, he had the feeling that he was holding something that never was quite his—his.Something too delicate, too precious, that would fly away once he let go."
"“看在上帝的份上咱们下船吧，去旅馆，那样我们就可以单独呆在一起了！”于是他使劲拉铃叫人来照看着行李。","“For God’s sake let’s get off to the hotel so that we can be by ourselves!”And he rang the bell hard for some one to look sharp with the luggage."
"她挽着他的胳膊一块往码头上走着。他又能让她挽着他的胳膊了。跟在珍妮后面上了出租马车——把红黄条的毯子展开盖住两人——告诉司机快点开，他们两个都还连一点茶点都没用呢——这一切的一切都令他觉得不同。他不会再无茶可喝，也不会再只倒茶给自己喝了。她回来了。他转向她，紧紧抓着她的手，用只有和她说话时才用的“特别的”声音，温柔地、逗笑道：“又回家了，高兴吗？亲爱的？”她微微一笑，不予作答，但当车子开上光线更好一点的大街上时，她轻轻地把他的手从她的手上拿开。","Walking down the wharf together she took his arm.He had her on his arm again.And the difference it made to get into the cab after Janey—to throw the red-and-yellow striped blanket round them both—to tell the driver to hurry because neither of them had had any tea.No more going without his tea or pouring out his own.She was back.He turned to her, squeezed her hand, and said gently, teasingly, in the “special” voice he had for her: “Glad to be home again, dearie?”She smiled; she didn’t even bother to answer, but gently she drew his hand away as they came to the brighter streets."
"“我们在旅馆里要了最好的房间。”他说。“我是不会要别的什么房间的。而且我怕你觉得冷，还叫旅馆的服务员在房间生个火。她是个友好的、照顾周到的姑娘。而且我想既然我们现在到这儿了，明天就别忙着回家，索性花一天的时间到处看看，然后第二天早上再走。这样安排你满意吗？没什么可着急的，不是么？孩子们很快就会把着你不放……我认为长途跋涉之后观光一天是个不错的休整——是吧，珍妮？”","“We’ve got the best room in the hotel,” he said.“I wouldn’t be put off with another.And I asked the chambermaid to put in a bit of a fire in case you felt chilly.She’s a nice, attentive girl.And I thought now we were here we wouldn’t bother to go home tomorrow, but spend the day looking round and leave the morning after.Does that suit you?There’s no hurry, is there?The children will have you soon enough... I thought a day’s sight-seeing might make a nice break in your journey—eh, Janey?”"
"“后天的票你拿到了吗？”她问了一句。","“Have you taken the tickets for the day after?” she asked."
"“我想应该已经买好了！”他解开大衣扣，掏出了他鼓鼓的小笔记本。“在这儿呢！我订了去库克敦的头等车厢的票。在这儿——‘约翰·哈蒙德先生及夫人。’我想我们不如也让自己舒服一下，况且我们不想让别人来打扰，对吧？但如果你愿意在这儿多呆几天——？”","“I should think I have!”He unbuttoned his overcoat and took out his bulging pocket-book.“Here we are!I reserved a first-class carriage to Cooktown.There it is—‘Mr. and Mrs. John Hammond.’I thought we might as well do ourselves comfortably, and we don’t want other people butting in, do we?But if you’d like to stop here a bit longer—?”"
"“哦，不！”珍妮很快说，“无论如何都不要！那就后天好了。而且孩子们——”","“Oh, no!” said Janey quickly.“Not for the world!The day after tomorrow, then.And the children—”"
"他们已经到旅馆了。经理正站在宽敞的、灯火通明的门廊下。他走下来迎接他们。一个行李搬运工从大堂里跑过来帮他们拿行李。","But they had reached the hotel.The manager was standing in the broad, brilliantly-lighted porch.He came down to greet them.A porter ran from the hall for their boxes."
"“好了，阿诺德先生，这位是哈蒙德太太，终于到了！”","“Well, Mr. Arnold, here’s Mrs. Hammond at last!”"
"经理亲自领他们穿过大厅，并为他们按下电梯铃。哈蒙德知道他有一些生意伙伴正坐在小厅的桌旁，在晚餐前喝上一杯。但他不想冒被人打扰的风险，因此他目不斜视。他们爱想什么就想什么好了。如果他们不理解他，那么他们就更是傻瓜了——他步出电梯，开了他们房间的门，然后把珍妮领进屋。门关好了。现在，他们终于单独在一起了。他打开灯。窗帘已经拉好，炉火也正旺。他把帽子扔到那个巨大的床上，向她走去。","The manager led them through the hall himself and pressed the elevator-bell.Hammond knew there were business pals of his sitting at the little hall tables having a drink before dinner.But he wasn’t going to risk interruption; he looked neither to the right nor the left.They could think what they pleased.If they didn’t understand, the more fools they—and he stepped out of the lift, unlocked the door of their room, and shepherded Janey in.The door shut.Now, at last, they were alone together.He turned up the light.The curtains were drawn; the fire blazed.He flung his hat on to the huge bed and went towards her."
"但是——你相信吗！——他们又被人打扰了。这次是给他们送行李的搬运工。那么点行李他送了两趟，之间大门还敞开着，他不慌不忙，在走廊里还吹着口哨。哈蒙德在房间里来来回回地走着，扯掉手套，拽下围巾。最后他把大衣扔到床边。","But—would you believe it!—again they were interrupted.This time it was the porter with the luggage.He made two journeys of it, leaving the door open in between, taking his time, whistling through his teeth in the corridor.Hammond paced up and down the room, tearing off his gloves, tearing off his scarf.Finally he flung his overcoat on to the bedside."
"那个蠢货终于走了。门咔哒一声关上了。现在只有他们两个人了。哈蒙德说：“我觉得我将永远都无法重新拥有你。这些该死的家伙！珍妮”——接着他炽热、急切的目光胶着在她身上，——“咱们就在房间里吃晚餐好吧。如果我们下去到餐厅就又会被打扰，而且还有那么讨厌的音乐。”（那音乐就在前一天晚上才被他那么高度地赞扬过，他还那么热烈地为之鼓掌。）“我们都不能听到彼此讲话。咱们就叫点东西上来，在火炉前吃。现在喝下午茶太晚了。我叫一点晚餐，好吗？你觉得这个主意怎么样？”","At last the fool was gone.The door clicked.Now they were alone.Said Hammond: “I feel I’ll never have you to myself again.These cursed people!Janey”—and he bent his flushed, eager gaze upon her—“let’s have dinner up here.If we go down to the restaurant we’ll be interrupted, and then there’s the confounded music” (the music he’d praised so highly, applauded so loudly last night!).“We shan’t be able to hear each other speak.Let’s have something up here in front of the fire.It’s too late for tea.I’ll order a little supper, shall I?How does that idea strike you?”"
"“行，亲爱的！”“行，亲爱的！”珍妮说。“那么在你出去的时候——孩子们的信——”","“Do, darling!”“Do, darling!” said Janey.“And while you’re away—the children’s letters—”"
"“哦，一会儿再看！”哈蒙德说。","“Oh, later on will do!” said Hammond."
"“但是那样的话我们可以把信看完了。”珍妮说，“我先抽空儿——”","“But then we’d get it over,” said Janey.“And I’d first have time to—”"
"“哦，我不用下去！”哈蒙德解释道，“我只需按铃吩咐下去……你不会是想把我支开，是吧？”","“Oh, I needn’t go down!” explained Hammond.“I’ll just ring and give the order... you don’t want to send me away, do you?”"
"珍妮摇摇头，微微一笑。","Janey shook her head and smiled."
"“但是你正想别的事。你在为什么事情担心。”哈蒙德说。“是什么事？来，到这儿坐——过来，到火炉前坐在我膝上。”","“But you’re thinking of something else.You’re worrying about something,” said Hammond.“What is it?Come and sit here—come and sit on my knee before the fire.”"
"“我只是要把帽子解开，”珍妮说，接着她走向梳妆台。“啊——呀！”她小声叫了一下。“怎么了？”","“I’ll just unpin my hat,” said Janey, and she went over to the dressing-table.“A—ah!”She gave a little cry.“What is it?”"
"“没事，亲爱的。我刚刚看到孩子们的信了。这就好了。它们先留着。现在不急着看！”她转向他，手里紧紧攥那些信。她把信塞进她饰有荷叶边的衬衫中。她很快又高兴地叫道：“噢，这张梳妆台多么符合你的风格！”","“Nothing, darling.I’ve just found the children’s letters.That’s all right!They will keep.No hurry now!”She turned to him, clasping them.She tucked them into her frilled blouse.She cried quickly, gaily: “Oh, how typical this dressing-table is of you!”"
"“为什么？它怎么了？”哈蒙德问道。","“Why?What’s the matter with it?” said Hammond."
"“如果它活过来，我得叫它‘约翰’。”　珍妮一边大笑，一边盯着那一大瓶护发剂，装在柳条瓶内的一瓶古龙水，两把发刷，还有一打粉色丝带捆着的新衣领。“这就是你全部的行李啰？”","“If it were floating in eternity I should say ‘John!’” laughed Janey, staring at the big bottle of hair tonic, the wicker bottle of eau-de-Cologne, the two hair-brushes, and a dozen new collars tied with pink tape.“Is this all your luggage?”"
"“让我的行李见鬼去吧！”哈蒙德说。但是尽管如此，他喜欢让珍妮嘲笑他。“咱们谈谈。咱们好好谈点事。告诉我”——当珍妮在他的腿上坐下，他往后靠了靠，把她拉到那把又深又丑的椅子里——“对我说你真的高兴回家，珍妮。”","“Hang my luggage!” said Hammond;but all the same he liked being laughed at by Janey.“Let’s talk.Let’s get down to things.Tell me”—and as Janey perched on his knees he leaned back and drew her into the deep, ugly chair—“tell me you’re really glad to be back, Janey.”"
"“是的，亲爱的。我真的高兴回来。”她说。","“Yes, darling, I am glad,” she said."
"但是恰恰就在他抱着她的时候，他觉得她就要离他而去，因此哈蒙德永远都不知道——永远都不会确切地知道她是否和他一样高兴。他如何才能知道？他最终会知道吗？他会不会永远都有这种渴求——这种如饥似渴的痛楚，不知怎地都要让珍妮完完全全地属于他以至于她再也逃无可逃？他想把一切人、一切事统统抹掉。他真希望他现在已经把灯关掉了。那样可能让她离他更近些。而现在孩子们的那些信在她的衬衣里沙沙作响。他真该早点把它们扔进火里去。","But just as when he embraced her he felt she would fly away, so Hammond never knew—never knew for dead certain that she was as glad as he was.How could he know?Would he ever know?Would he always have this craving—this pang like hunger, somehow, to make Janey so much part of him that there wasn’t any of her to escape?He wanted to blot out everybody, everything.He wished now he’d turned off the light.That might have brought her nearer.And now those letters from the children rustled in her blouse.He could have chucked them into the fire."
"“珍妮。”他低低地叫。","“Janey,” he whispered."
"“嗯，亲爱的？”她躺在他的胸前，却那么地轻盈，那么地冷淡。他们呼出的气息交织在一起。","“Yes, dear?”She lay on his breast, but so lightly, so remotely.Their breathing rose and fell together."
"“珍妮！”","“Janey!”"
"“怎么了？”","“What is it?”"
"“转向我。”他低声说。一抹红晕涌上他的额头，慢慢变深。“吻我，珍妮！你吻我！”","“Turn to me,” he whispered.A slow, deep flush flowed into his forehead.“Kiss me, Janey!You kiss me!”"
"在她的双唇稳稳地、轻轻地触到他的之前，他觉得似乎短短地顿了一下——可是在他看来却长得足以令他难以忍受——她像往常一样地亲吻着他，那吻仿佛——他该如何描述它呢？——就像批准了他们所说的，在合同上签字。但是那不是他想要的，那根本就不是他所渴望的东西。他感到一阵突如其来的、可怕的疲惫。","It seemed to him there was a tiny pause—but long enough for him to suffer torture—before her lips touched his, firmly, lightly—kissing them as she always kissed him, as though the kiss—how could he describe it?—confirmed what they were saying, signed the contract.But that wasn’t what he wanted; that wasn’t at all what he thirsted for.He felt suddenly, horrible tired."
"“如果你知道，”他睁开眼睛说，“像今天那样——一直等着是一种什么感觉就好了。我以为那船永远都不会靠岸了。我们就在那儿等着，无所事事。什么事让你们拖了那么长时间？”","“If you knew,” he said, opening his eyes, “what it’s been like—waiting today.I thought the boat never would come in.There we were, hanging about.What kept you so long?”"
"她没有回答。她的视线从他身上移开，看着炉火。火苗快速地——快速地从煤里蹿出来，摇曳着，落下去。","She made no answer.She was looking away from him at the fire.The flames hurried—hurried over the coals, flickered, fell."
"“没睡着，是吧？”哈蒙德说着，一上一下地颠着她。","“Not asleep, are you?” said Hammond, and he jumped her up and down."
"“没有。”她说。然后她又说道：“别颠，亲爱的。别那样，我正思考问题呢。实际上，”她说，“昨天晚上有一位乘客去世了——是一个男的。就是这件事让我们耽搁了。我们把他带回来——我的意思是，他没有海葬。因此，船医和岸上的医生当然——”","“No,” she said.And then: “Don’t do that, dear.No, I was thinking.As a matter of fact,” she said, “one of the passengers died last night—a man.That’s what held us up.We brought him in—I mean, he wasn’t buried at sea.So, of course, the ship’s doctor and the shore doctor—”"
"“怎么了？”哈蒙德不安地问。他讨厌听人谈及死亡。他讨厌发生这样的事。他古怪地认为，这件事就仿佛他和珍妮在回旅馆的路上遇上了葬礼。","“What was it?” asked Hammond uneasily.He hated to hear of death.He hated this to have happened.It was, in some queer way, as though he and Janey had met a funeral on their way to the hotel."
"“噢，它根本就不传染！”珍妮说。她说话轻得几不可闻。“是心脏病。”她停了一会儿。“可怜的孩子！”她说，“非常年轻。”她看着炉火上下摇曳。“他就死在我怀里。”珍妮说。","“Oh, it wasn’t anything in the least infectious!” said Janey.She was speaking scarcely above her breath.“It was heart.”A pause.“Poor fellow!” she said.“Quite young.”And she watched the fire flicker and fall.“He died in my arms,” said Janey."
"打击来得如此突然，哈蒙德觉得自己要昏倒了。他无法移动，也无法呼吸。他觉得他所有的力气都流走了——流进这把黑沉沉的大椅子里，而这把黑沉沉的大椅子牢牢地把着他，紧紧地抓住他，强迫他忍受这一切。","The blow was so sudden that Hammond thought he would faint.He couldn’t move; he couldn’t breathe.He felt all his strength flowing—flowing into the big dark chair, and the big dark chair held him fast, gripped him, forced him to bear it."
"“什么？”他呆呆地说。你那话说的是什么？”","“What?” he said dully.“What’s that you say?”"
"“他死得非常平静。”低低的声音说道，“他只是”——哈蒙德看着她抬起她温柔的手——“在最后一刻呼出一口气结束了生命而已。”她的手放下了。","“The end was quite peaceful,” said the small voice.“He just”—and Hammond saw her lift her gentle hand—“breathed his life away at the end.”And her hand fell."
"“谁——还有谁在那？”哈蒙德勉强问出一句。","“Who—else was there?” Hammond managed to ask."
"“没别人。就我一个人和他在一起。”","“Nobody.I was alone with him.”"
"啊，我的上帝，她在说什么！她正对他做什么呀！这会要了他的命！可是她却一直说着：","Ah, my God, what was she saying!What was she doing to him!This would kill him!And all the while she spoke:"
"“我看着有些不对劲就打发服务员去叫医生，但是医生来得太迟了。他无论如何都无计可施了。”","“I saw the change coming and I sent the steward for the doctor, but the doctor was too late.He couldn’t have done anything, anyway.”"
"“但是——为什么是你，为什么是你呢？”哈蒙德呻吟道。","“But—why you, why you?” moaned Hammond."
"听到这话珍妮迅速地转过身，很快地在他的脸上搜寻。","At that Janey turned quickly, quickly searched his face."
"“你不会介意的，约翰，是吧？”她问。“你不——这和你我毫不相干。”","“You don’t mind, John, do you?” she asked.“You don’t—It’s nothing to do with you and me.”"
"不管怎么样他总算冲她摆出了个笑模样。不管怎么样他总算结结巴巴地说：“不——继——续，继续！我想让你告诉我。”","Somehow or other he managed to shake some sort of smile at her.Somehow or other he stammered: “No—go—on, go on!I want you to tell me.”"
"“但是，约翰亲爱的——”","“But, John darling—”"
"“告诉我，珍妮！”","“Tell me, Janey!”"
"“没什么可告诉的了。”她纳闷地说，“他是头等舱的一名乘客。他上船时我就看出他病得挺重……。但是直到昨天，他看起来好多了。下午他心脏病复发得很厉害——兴奋——紧张，我想是不是快到家了的缘故。而从那以后他就再也没苏醒过来。”","“There’s nothing to tell,” she said, wondering.“He was one of the first-class passengers.I saw he was very ill when he came on board... But he seemed to be so much better until yesterday.He had a severe attack in the afternoon—excitement—nervousness, I think, about arriving.And after that he never recovered.”"
"“可为什么服务员不——”","“But why didn’t the stewardess—”"
"“噢，亲爱的——服务员！”珍妮说。“那他会怎么想？而且……他可能想留个口信……给——”","“Oh, my dear—the stewardess!” said Janey.“What would he have felt?And besides... he might have wanted to leave a message... to—”"
"“他没留吗？”哈蒙德咕哝道。“他什么都没说吗？”","“Didn’t he?” muttered Hammond.“Didn’t he say anything?”"
"“没说，亲爱的，连一个字都没说！”她轻轻地摇摇头。“我和他在一起的那段时间里他一直都太虚弱了……他虚弱得甚至连一根手指都动不了……”","“No, darling, not a word!”She shook her head softly.“All the time I was with him he was too weak... he was too weak even to move a finger... ”"
"珍妮沉默下来。但她的话语，那么轻、那么柔、却又那么冷，好像盘旋在空中，像雪一样落进他的胸中。","Janey was silent.But her words, so light, so soft, so chill, seemed to hover in the air, to rain into his breast like snow."
"炉火刚才变红了。现在随着啪的一声，火势弱了下来，房间里更冷了。寒意慢慢爬上了他的胳膊。这个房间极高、极大、极亮。填满了他的整个世界。还有一张隐约可见的大床，他的大衣就随便地抛在上面像一个无头人正在做祷告。还有那些行李都打好了，准备再次被搬到什么地方，或被扔进火车，或被运上船。","The fire had gone red.Now it fell in with a sharp sound and the room was colder.Cold crept up his arms.The room was huge, immense, glittering. It filled his whole world.There was the great blind bed, with his coat flung across it like some headless man saying his prayers.There was the luggage, ready to be carried away again, anywhere, tossed into trains, carted on to boats."
"……“他太虚弱了。他虚弱得连一根手指都动不了。”然而他却死在了珍妮的怀里。她——从未——这么多年以来连一次都没有——从没有在独自一人的时候——","... “He was too weak.He was too weak to move a finger.”And yet he died in Janey’s arms.She—who’d never—never once in all these years—never on one single solitary occasion—"
"不，他不可以去想了。老想，他会发疯的。不行，他无法面对。他受不了这个。这太让人难以忍受了！","No; he mustn’t think of it.Madness lay in thinking of it.No, he wouldn’t face it.He couldn’t stand it.It was too much to bear!"
"可是现在珍妮用手指触摸着他的领带。她把领带的两边捏在一起。","And now Janey touched his tie with her fingers.She pinched the edges of the tie together."
"“你不会——对不起我告诉你这些，约翰亲爱的？这没让你难过吧？它没毁了我们的夜晚——我们单独呆在一起的时间吧？”","“You’re not—sorry I told you, John darling?It hasn’t made you sad?It hasn’t spoilt our evening—our being alone together?”"
"可是听到这些他不得不藏起他的脸。他把脸埋在她的胸前，用胳膊抱住了她。","But at that he had to hide his face.He put his face into her bosom and his arms enfolded her."
"毁了他们的夜晚！毁了他们单独在一起的时间！他们将永远都不会单独呆在一起了。","Spoilt their evening!Spoilt their being alone together!They would never be alone together again."
