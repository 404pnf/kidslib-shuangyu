"魔鬼和汤姆·沃克","The Devil and Tom Walker"
"作者：华盛顿·欧文　","by Washington Irving"
"在离波士顿几英里外的马萨诸塞州，有一个深深的海湾，从查尔斯湾起，曲折蜿蜒好几里，深入内陆，尽头是一个树木茂密的湿地，或者叫沼泽。海湾的一面是美丽茂密的丛林，对面的水边突兀地耸立着高岗，高岗上疏疏落落地长着几株年代久远的巨大橡树。根据古老的传说，海盗基德曾在其中一株大树下面埋下宝藏。这个海湾是个很方便的地方，只用一只船就能在夜里秘密地把钱运到山脚下。这里地势很高，利于放风，保证附近没有人。同时，这里醒目的大树是很好的地标，日后很容易找到这里。此外，这个古老的传说还讲到，当时是埋葬宝藏的过程是由魔鬼主持的，并且由魔鬼亲自看守这些钱。但这件事众所周知，埋在地下的宝藏，尤其是不义之财，向来都是由魔鬼掌管的。无论如何，基德从未回来取他的财物。因为不久之后他在波士顿被抓，被遣送到英国，在那里以海盗罪被绞死了。","A few miles from Boston, in Massachusetts, there is a deep inlet winding several miles into the interior of the country from Charles Bay, and terminating in a thickly-wooded swamp, or morass.On one side of this inlet is a beautiful dark grove; on the opposite side the land rises abruptly from the water’s edge, into a high ridge on which grow a few scattered oaks of great age and immense size.It was under one of these gigantic trees, according to old stories, that Kidd the pirate buried his treasure.The inlet allowed a facility to bring the money in a boat secretly and at night to the very foot of the hill.The elevation of the place permitted a good look-out to be kept that no one was at hand, while the remarkable trees formed good landmarks by which the place might easily be found again.The old stories add, moreover, that the devil presided at the hiding of the money, and took it under his guardianship; but this, it is well-known, he always does with buried treasure, particularly when it has been ill gotten.Be that as it may, Kidd never returned to recover his wealth; being shortly after seized at Boston, sent out to England, and there hanged for a pirate."
"大约是在公元一七二七年，当时地震席卷整个新英格兰，吓得许多趾高气扬、罪孽深重的人都跪了下来。这附近住着一个削瘦的小气鬼，名叫汤姆·沃克。他有一个和他一样小气的妻子，他们甚至小气到连夫妻间也互相欺瞒。这个女人会藏起所有到手的东西；母鸡还没有咯咯叫，她就等着收它新下的蛋。她丈夫总是不停窥探，寻找她私藏的小金库。为那些本该成为公共财产的东西，两人总是激烈地争吵。他们住的房子看起来很荒凉，孤零零地立在那儿，使人想起饥荒。房子附近零散地长着几棵圆柏，成了贫瘠的标志，烟囱从没冒过烟，也从没有旅客会在门口停下来。一匹可怜的马在田里踱着，它的肋骨像烤肉架上的铁条一样清晰可辨。田里只有一层薄薄的青苔，连那点凹凸不平的石子路也遮不住，只能使这匹马更加饥饿，备受折磨。它有时把头靠在篱笆上，可怜地望着路人，好像请求他们把它从这块闹饥荒的土地上救走似的。","About the year 1727, just at the time when earthquakes were prevalent in New England, and shook many tall sinners down upon their knees, there lived near this place a meagre miserly fellow of the name of Tom Walker.He had a wife as miserly as himself; they were so miserly that they even conspired to cheat each other.Whatever the woman could lay hands on she hid away; a hen could not cackle but she was on the alert to secure the new-laid egg.Her husband was continually prying about to detect her secret hoards, and many and fierce were the conflicts that took place about what ought to have been common property.They lived in a forlorn-looking house, that stood alone and had an air of starvation.A few straggling savin trees, emblems of sterility, grew near it; no smoke ever curled from its chimney; no traveller stopped at its door.A miserable horse, whose ribs were as articulate as the bars of a gridiron, stalked about a field where a thin carpet of moss, scarcely covering the ragged beds of pudding-stone, tantalized and balked his hunger; and sometimes he would lean his head over the fence, looked piteously at the passer-by, and seem to petition deliverance from this land of famine."
"这座房子和它的住户名声都不好。汤姆的老婆是个高大的泼妇，性格凶悍，嗓门很大，胳膊也很结实。经常可以听到她和丈夫打嘴架的声音，有时她丈夫脸上挂了彩，就知道他们的冲突不仅仅是口角。但是，没人敢插手他们之间的事，独行的过路人，对于他们又打又骂的情景只能望而却步，眼睛瞟着这个不和谐的家庭，赶紧赶路。如果是个单身汉，一定会庆幸自己没有老婆。","The house and its inmates had altogether a bad name.Tom’s wife was a tall termagant, fierce of temper, loud of tongue, and strong of arm.Her voice was often heard in wordy warfare with her husband; and his face sometimes showed signs that their conflicts were not confined to words.No one ventured, however, to interfere between them; the lonely wayfarer shrunk within himself at the horrid clamor and clapper-clawing; eyed the den of discord askance, and hurried on his way, rejoicing, if a bachelor, in his celibacy."
"一天，汤姆·沃克去了附近一个较远的地方，回家时，他从沼泽中穿过，自认为找到一条捷径。和很多捷径一样，这条捷径选得很不妙。这个沼泽密密麻麻地长满了巨大阴森的松树和铁杉，其中一些高达九十英尺，即使在正午，树林里也很暗，所以这里成了附近所有猫头鹰的栖息地。这里尽是水坑和泥沼，一部分覆盖着水草和苔藓，绿色的外表常常骗得路人落入一坑漆黑胶粘的污泥中。同时，这儿还有许多阴暗淤塞的池塘，住着蝌蚪，大青蛙和水蛇，其中有很多松树和铁杉的树干，一半浸在水里，一半在腐烂，看上去就像在泥坑中沉睡的鳄鱼。","One day that Tom Walker had been to a distant part of the neighborhood, he took what he considered a short cut homewards through the swamp.Like most short cuts, it was an ill-chosen route.The swamp was thickly grown with great gloomy pines and hemlocks, some of them ninety feet high; which made it dark at noon-day, and a retreat for all the owls of the neighborhood.It was full of pits and quagmires, partly covered with weeds and mosses; where the green surface often betrayed the traveller into a gulf of black smothering mud; there were also dark and stagnant pools, the abodes of the tadpole, the bull-frog, and the water-snake, and where trunks of pines and hemlocks lay half drowned, half rotting, looking like alligators, sleeping in the mire."
"汤姆走了很久才谨慎地穿过这片险恶的丛林，他从一丛丛的灯芯草和树根中跨过去，但这些落脚点在深深的泥沼中也不稳当。他像一只猫一样，沿着倒下来的树干小心地前行。时而鹭鸶尖叫一声，时而野鸭聒噪一声，从僻静的池塘展翅起飞，都会吓他一跳。最后，他终于走上了一块结实的土地，这块地好像是一个延伸到沼泽深处的半岛。这里是印第安人与第一批殖民者进行斗争的据点之一。他们曾在此建造了一个自己认为坚不可摧的堡垒作为他们妻儿的避难所。现在的印第安碉堡，只剩下了断壁残垣，逐渐变得与周围的土地一样平了，一部分已经长满了橡树和其它树木，它们的枝叶与沼泽里阴暗的松树和铁杉形成鲜明的对比。","Tom had long been picking his way cautiously through this treacherous forest; stepping from tuft to tuft of rushes and roots which afforded precarious footholds among deep sloughs; or pacing carefully, like a cat, among the prostrate trunks of trees; startled now and then by the sudden screaming of the bittern, or the quacking of a wild duck, rising on the wing from some solitary pool.At length he arrived at a piece of firm ground, which ran out like a peninsula into the deep bosom of the swamp.It had been one of the strongholds of the Indians during their wars with the first colonists.Here they had thrown up a kind of fort which they had looked upon as almost impregnable, and had used as a place of refuge for their squaws and children.Nothing remained of the Indian fort but a few embankments gradually sinking to the level of the surrounding earth, and already overgrown in part by oaks and other forest trees, the foliage of which formed a contrast to the dark pines and hemlocks of the swamp."
"汤姆来到了一座古堡，这时天色已晚，于是他停下来稍作休息。除了他之外，任何人都不愿在这样荒凉阴郁的地方停留，因为一般人听过印第安战争流传下来的故事后，都对古堡没什么好感。他们深信，那些野蛮人曾在这里施咒念符，为恶鬼献祭品。但是，汤姆·沃克对此类故事并不害怕。","It was late in the dusk of evening that Tom Walker reached the old fort, and he paused there for a while to rest himself.Any one but he would have felt unwilling to linger in this lonely, melancholy place, for the common people had a bad opinion of it from the stories handed down from the time of the Indian wars; when it was asserted that the savages held incantations here and made sacrifices to the evil spirit.Tom Walker, however, was not a man to be troubled with any fears of the kind."
"他在一个倒下的铁杉树干上休息了一会儿，听着雨蛙不吉利的叫声，他把手杖插进脚边的一堆黑土里。在他不经意间把土翻上来的时候，手杖碰到了一个坚硬的东西。他把它从肥沃的土里挖了出来。瞧！一颗裂开的头骨赫然就在眼前，上面还深深地插着一把印第安战斧。从战斧上斑斑的锈迹来看，这致命的一击显然发生在很久以前。这是印第安战士们在最后的据点上浴血奋战的悲惨纪念品。","He reposed himself for some time on the trunk of a fallen hemlock, listening to the boding cry of the tree-toad, and delving with his walking-staff into a mound of black mould at his feet.As he turned up the soil unconsciously, his staff struck against something hard.He raked it out of the vegetable mould, and lo! a cloven skull with an Indian tomahawk buried deep in it, lay before him.The rust on the weapon showed the time that had elapsed since this death blow had been given.It was a dreary memento of the fierce struggle that had taken place in this last foothold of the Indian warriors."
"“哼！”汤姆边说边踢了它一脚，将上面的泥土踢掉。","“Humph!” said Tom Walker, as he gave the skull a kick to shake the dirt from it."
"“别动那个骷髅！”一个粗鲁的声音说道。","“Let that skull alone!” said a gruff voice."
"汤姆抬眼一看，一个高大黝黑的男人坐在他对面的一个树桩上。他很是吃惊，之前没看到或听到有人接近，更让他吃惊的是，在越来越暗的天色里，这个人看起来既不是黑人也不是印第安人。他穿着半印第安的粗布衣服，身上还系着一条红腰带，但他那张脸看起来不是黑人，也不是印第安人，而是黑黝黝的，脏脏的，好像烟熏过，又像涂满了灰尘，好像经常在炉子边工作似的。他那一头又粗又黑头发向各个方向竖着，肩膀上扛着一把斧子。","Tom lifted up his eyes and beheld a great black man, seated directly Opposite him on the stump of a tree.He was exceedingly surprised, having neither seen nor heard any one approach, and he was still more perplexed on observing, as well as the gathering gloom would permit, that the stranger was neither negro nor Indian.It is true, he was dressed in a rude, half Indian garb, and had a red belt or sash swathed round his body, but his face was neither black nor copper color, but swarthy and dingy and begrimed with soot, as if he had been accustomed to toil among fires and forges.He had a shock of coarse black hair, that stood out from his head in all directions; and bore an axe on his shoulder."
"他眼睛又大又圆，愤怒地盯了汤姆一会儿。","He scowled for a moment at Tom with a pair of great red eyes."
"“你在我的地盘上干什么？”这个黑汉用嘶哑的声音咆哮道。","“What are you doing in my grounds?” said the black man, with a hoarse growling voice."
"“你的地盘？”汤姆冷笑道，“这块地既不是我的也不是你的，这块地是教堂执事皮博迪的。”","“Your grounds?” said Tom, with a sneer; “no more your grounds than mine: they belong to Deacon Peabody.”"
"“教堂执事皮博迪该进地狱了，”陌生人说道，“当我是自夸吧，如果他不多想想自己的罪孽，少想想邻居的罪孽，他总会有那一天的。看看那边，看看教堂执事皮博迪的情况吧。”","“Deacon Peabody be d—d,” said the stranger, “as I flatter myself he will be, if he does not look more to his own sins and less to his neighbor’s.Look yonder, and see how Deacon Peabody is faring.”"
"汤姆朝陌生人指的方向望去，看到一棵大树，虽然美丽茂盛，树心却腐烂了，看得出它已经几乎被砍断了，所以一阵大风就能把它吹倒。树皮上刻着教堂执事皮博迪的名字。他又向四周瞧了瞧，发现大多数的大树上都刻着殖民时期一些大人物的名字，而且多多少少都被斧子砍过。他坐的这一棵，明显是刚刚被砍倒的，树上刻着克劳宁希尔德的名字，汤姆想到了一个很有钱有势的人，也叫这个名字，他常常庸俗地炫耀他的财富，人们都说他的财产是海上打劫而来的。","Tom looked in the direction that the stranger pointed, and beheld one of the great trees, fair and flourishing without, but rotten at the core, and saw that it had been nearly hewn through, so that the first high wind was likely to blow it down.On the bark of the tree was scored the name of Deacon Peabody.He now looked round and found most of the tall trees marked with the names of some great men of the colony, and all more or less scored by the axe.The one on which he had been seated, and which had evidently just been hewn down, bore the name of Crowninshield; and he recollected a mighty rich man of that name, who made a vulgar display of wealth, which it was whispered he had acquired by buccaneering."
"“它就要当柴烧了！”这黑汉一边说，一边得意地哼了一声，“你看见了，我今年冬天的柴火会很充足。”","“He’s just ready for burning!” said the black man, with a growl of triumph.“You see I am likely to have a good stock of firewood for winter.”"
"“但是你有什么权利，”汤姆说，“砍掉教堂执事皮博迪的木材？”","“But what right have you,” said Tom, “to cut down Deacon Peabody’s timber?”"
"“优先权，”他说道，“这片树林早在你们这些白人踏上这片土地之前就已经属于我了。”","“The right of prior claim,” said the other.“This woodland belonged to me long before one of your white-faced race put foot upon the soil.”"
"“朋友，我斗胆问问，你是谁啊？”汤姆说。","“And pray, who are you, if I may be so bold?” said Tom."
"“哦，我有很多名字。有些国家叫我野猎人；其他国家则叫我黑矿工。在附近这一带，大家叫我黑樵夫。红种人把这片土地献给了我，不时烤一个白人，献给我当美味的祭品。自从红种人被你们野蛮的白人赶尽杀绝后，我就主持迫害贵格会教徒和再洗礼派教徒的仪式，当作消遣；我是奴隶贩子的重要赞助人和保护者，塞勒姆巫师的大总管。”","“Oh, I go by various names.I am the Wild Huntsman in some countries; the Black Miner in others.In this neighborhood I am known by the name of the Black Woodsman.I am he to whom the red men devoted this spot, and now and then roasted a white man by way of sweet-smelling sacrifice.Since the red men have been exterminated by you white savages, I amuse myself by presiding at the persecutions of quakers and anabaptists; I am the great patron and prompter of slave dealers, and the grand master of the Salem witches.”"
"“总的来说，如果我没弄错，”汤姆坚定地说，“你就是大家所说的魔鬼了。”","“The upshot of all which is, that, if I mistake not,” said Tom, sturdily, “you are he commonly called Old Scratch.”"
"“我随时为您服务！”黑汉一面回答，一面又比较礼貌地点头。","“The same at your service!” replied the black man, with a half civil nod."
"按照古老的传说，这就是他们会面时的开场白。不过，他们的语气太过亲近了，令人难以置信。有人一定会想，在这个荒凉孤寂的野外，遇到这个怪家伙，无论是谁都会吓得魂不附体；但汤姆是个胆大的人，不容易被吓到，因为和泼妇一样的老婆住久了，他连魔鬼都不怕。","Such was the opening of this interview, according to the old story, though it has almost too familiar an air to be credited.One would think that to meet with such a singular personage in this wild, lonely place, would have shaken any man’s nerves; but Tom was a hard-minded fellow, not easily daunted, and he had lived so long with a termagant wife, that he did not even fear the devil."
"据说，这样开了头以后，他们在汤姆回家的路上又严肃地谈了很久。黑汉告诉他海盗基德曾经埋过很多笔财产，就在离沼泽不远的高岗上的橡树下。所有的宝藏都是由他支配，并由他负责保护。所以，除了他偏爱的人，没人能找到。他愿意把这些财物给汤姆·沃克，因为他对汤姆有特别的好感，但是只有在汤姆答应某些条件的情况下才会给他。那些条件是什么是很容易猜出来的，但是汤姆从没公开它们。这些条件一定很苛刻，因为汤姆要求考虑一段时间，汤姆并不是一个在金钱面前为小事犹豫不决的人。他们走到沼泽边缘时，那个陌生人停了下来。","It is said that after this commencement they had a long and earnest Conversation together, as Tom returned homewards.The black man told him of great sums of money which had been buried by Kidd the pirate, under the oak trees on the high ridge not far from the morass.All these were under his command and protected by his power, so that none could find them but such as propitiated his favor.These he offered to place within Tom Walker’s reach, having conceived an especial kindness for him: but they were to be had only on certain conditions.What these conditions were, may easily be surmised, though Tom never disclosed them publicly.They must have been very hard, for he required time to think of them, and he was not a man to stick at trifles where money was in view.When they had reached the edge of the swamp the stranger paused."
"“有什么证据证明你告诉我的都是真的？”汤姆问道。","“What proof have I that all you have been telling me is true?” said Tom."
"“我在这里留个记号。”黑汉边说边用手指在汤姆的额头上按了一下。说着，他一转身就回到了沼泽的树丛中去了。据汤姆说，仿佛向地里一点一点地沉下去，直到只能看到头和肩膀，接着，就完全不见踪影了。","“There is my signature,” said the black man, pressing his finger on Tom’s forehead.So saying, he turned off among the thickets of the swamp, and seemed, as Tom said, to go down, down, down, into the earth, until nothing but his head and shoulders could be seen, and so on until he totally disappeared."
"汤姆到家后发现，那个黑色指印看起来像是烙在额头上似的，无论用什么都擦不掉。","When Tom reached home he found the black print of a finger burnt, as it were, into his forehead, which nothing could obliterate."
"妻子告诉他的第一个消息就是：富有的海盗阿布沙洛姆·克劳宁希尔德突然死了。报纸用惯用的华丽词藻宣布：“上帝的一个伟大选民已经逝去。”","The first news his wife had to tell him was the sudden death of Absalom Crowninshield, the rich buccaneer.It was announced in the papers with the usual flourish, that “a great man had fallen in Israel.”"
"汤姆想起了他的黑朋友刚刚砍倒准备去烧的那棵树。“烧死那个海盗吧，”汤姆说，“谁管他！”他现在深信，自己之前的所见所闻并不是幻觉。","Tom recollected the tree which his black friend had just hewn down, and which was ready for burning.“Let the freebooter roast,” said Tom, “who cares!”He now felt convinced that all he had heard and seen was no illusion."
"他本来不会轻易让妻子知道他的秘密，但这个秘密让他心神不宁，他心甘情愿地告诉了妻子。一听到埋藏的宝藏，他老婆所有的贪欲都被激起来了，她催促丈夫答应黑汉的条件，以确保一辈子都能阔气地生活。汤姆虽然本来愿意把自己出卖给恶魔，但他不愿意为老婆尽力，就为了跟她作对，他下定决心，断然拒绝了。为了这件事，他们吵了很多架，每次都很激烈，但是妻子越是多说，汤姆越坚决，不会为了取悦她而受诅咒。最后，她决定亲自去谈这笔交易，如果成功，她会独吞得来的东西。","He was not prone to let his wife into his confidence; but as this was an uneasy secret, he willingly shared it with her.All her avarice was awakened at the mention of hidden gold, and she urged her husband to comply with the black man’s terms and secure what would make them wealthy for life.However Tom might have felt disposed to sell himself to the devil, he was determined not to do so to oblige his wife; so he flatly refused out of the mere spirit of contradiction.Many and bitter were the quarrels they had on the subject, but the more she talked the more resolute was Tom not to be damned to please her.At length she determined to drive the bargain on her own account, and if she succeeded, to keep all the gain to herself."
"她和丈夫一样，胆子很大，在一个夏天的傍晚，她向印第安古堡出发了。她去了好几个钟头。回来后，她保持沉默，不乐意回答别人的话。她只讲到在黄昏遇到了一个黑汉子，他正在砍着一棵大树的树根。但是，他很生气，不肯商谈；她还要带着礼物再去讨好他，但却不肯说是什么礼物。","Being of the same fearless temper as her husband, she sat off for the old Indian fort towards the close of a summer’s day.She was many hour’s absent.When she came back she was reserved and sullen in her replies.She spoke something of a black man whom she had met about twilight, hewing at the root of a tall tree.He was sulky, however, and would not come to terms; she was to go again with a propitiatory offering, but what it was she forebore to say."
"第二天傍晚，她又向着沼泽出发了，临走时围裙里包着很沉重的东西。汤姆一等再等，但却是徒劳的：半夜了，还没有她的踪影；到第二天早晨，中午，晚上，她还是没回来。汤姆越来越担心她的安全；尤其是发现她用围裙兜走了银茶壶、银调羹和所有轻便的值钱细软后，就更加不安了。又过了一夜，到了早晨，妻子还没回来。总之，再也没有听到她的消息。","The next evening she sat off again for the swamp, with her apron heavily laden.Tom waited and waited for her, but in vain: midnight came, but she did not make her appearance; morning, noon, night returned, but still she did not come.Tom now grew uneasy for her safety; especially as he found she had carried off in her apron the silver tea pot and spoons and every portable article of value.Another night elapsed, another morning came; but no wife.In a word, she was ever heard of more."
"装作知道她情况的人太多了，所以她的真实情况其实无人知晓。这件事到了各种各样的史学家手里变得扑朔迷离。一些人说她是在沼泽错综复杂的迷津里迷了路，陷进水坑或泥沼里了；有些说得更加无情，认为她包裹着家里的细软，逃到别的州了；其他人猜测是魔鬼把她骗到了一个可怕的沼泽里，因为他们发现她的帽子漂在沼泽上面。和这个说法相符的是，据说，当天晚上有一个黑汉，身材巨大，扛着斧子，得意洋洋地拿着一个用格子画布围裙包的包袱，从沼泽里走出来。","What was her real fate nobody knows, in consequence of so many pretending to know.It is one of those facts that have become confounded by a variety of historians.Some asserted that she lost her way among the tangled mazes of the swamp and sunk into some pit or slough; others, more uncharitable, hinted that she had eloped with the household booty, and made off to some other province; while others assert that the tempter had decoyed her into a dismal quagmire, on top of which her hat was found lying.In confirmation of this, it was said a great black man with an axe on his shoulder was seen late that very evening coming out of the swamp, carrying a bundle tied in a check apron, with an air of surly triumph."
"但是，最近最可靠的说法是：汤姆·沃克因为越来越担心妻子的命运和他的财产，最终去印第安古堡寻找妻子和财物了。一个漫长夏日的下午，他搜寻了那个幽暗的地方，但却没找到他妻子。他不停地呼喊老婆的名字，但却没听到她的声音。只有鹭鸶飞过的尖叫声回应着他的呼喊；附近池塘里大青蛙发出悲惨的呱呱声。据说，直到暮色降临，猫头鹰开始鸣叫，蝙蝠飞来飞去时，他的注意力被吃腐肉的乌鸦吸引了，它们正在一株柏树周围盘旋。他抬头看见一个格子花布包袱，正吊在树枝上面，旁边停着一只大秃鹫，好像在看守似的。他高兴得笑了起来，认出这是他老婆的围裙，觉得那里面肯定装着家里的财物。","The most current and probable story, however, observes that Tom Walker grew so anxious about the fate of his wife and his property that he sat out at length to seek them both at the Indian fort.During a long summer’s afternoon he searched about the gloomy place, but no wife was to be seen.He called her name repeatedly, but she was no where to be heard.The bittern alone responded to his voice, as he flew screaming by; or the bull-frog croaked dolefully from a neighboring pool.At length, it is said, just in the brown hour of twilight, when the owls began to hoot and the bats to flit about, his attention was attracted by the clamor of carrion crows that were hovering about a cypress tree.He looked and beheld a bundle tied in a check apron and hanging in the branches of a tree; with a great vulture perched hard by, as if keeping watch upon it.He leaped with joy, for he recognized his wife’s apron, and supposed it to contain the household valuables."
"“先让我把财物拿下来，”他自我安慰道，“没有那个女人我也能应付得来。”","“Let us get hold of the property,” said he consolingly to himself, “and we will endeavor to do without the woman.”"
"他爬上树的时候，秃鹫张开宽大的翅膀，一路尖叫着飞向树林深处。汤姆拿到格子围裙，可是一瞧，简直惨透了！除了一颗心和一个肝什么也没找到。","As he scrambled up the tree the vulture spread its wide wings, and sailed off screaming into the deep shadows of the forest.Tom seized the check apron, but, woful sight! found nothing but a heart and liver tied up in it."
"根据最可靠的传说，这就是汤姆妻子留下的所有东西。她可能尝试用经常对付丈夫的办法来对付那个黑汉；但是，虽然通常人们都把女人的咒骂当作魔鬼一样，但是在这个事件中，她似乎倒霉了。不过，她一定是垂死挣扎过，从遗留的争斗的痕迹可见。确实是这样，据说汤姆注意到树周围有许多很深的偶蹄印，还有几缕头发，好像是从樵夫那又粗又黑的乱发中扯下来的。汤姆知道，这正是他老婆惯用的本领。他望着这种狠抓狠打的战迹，耸了耸肩。“天哪，”他自言自语，“魔鬼肯定被她打得很惨！”","Such, according to the most authentic old story, was all that was to be found of Tom’s wife.She had probably attempted to deal with the black man as she had been accustomed to deal with her husband; but though a female scold is generally considered a match for the devil, yet in this instance she appears to have had the worst of it.She must have died game, however: from the part that remained unconquered.Indeed, it is said Tom noticed many prints of cloven feet deeply stamped about the tree, and several handfuls of hair that looked as if they had been plucked from the coarse black shock of the woodsman.Tom knew his wife’s prowess by experience.He shrugged his shoulders as he looked at the signs of a fierce clapper-clawing.“Egad,” said he to himself, “Old Scratch must have had a tough time of it!”"
"汤姆是个豁达的人，他用失去妻子来安慰自己失去财物的损失。他甚至对黑樵夫心存感激，认为他为自己做了件好事。因此，他继续寻找，想把交情扯得更深一点，但是没有找到。那个老黑怪行事谨慎，不管大家怎样想，他都不是召之即来的人，当有把握的时候，他知道该怎样出牌。","Tom consoled himself for the loss of his property by the loss of his wife; for he was a little of a philosopher.He even felt something like gratitude towards the black woodsman, who he considered had done him a kindness.He sought, therefore, to cultivate a farther acquaintance with him, but for some time without success; the old black legs played shy, for whatever people may think, he is not always to be had for calling for; he knows how to play his cards when pretty sure of his game."
"据说，最后耽搁到让汤姆亟不可待，都准备做任何事情来得到那笔允诺的财宝。于是，一天晚上他遇到那个黑汉，如往常的樵夫装扮，肩上扛着斧子，沿着沼泽边闲逛着，还哼着曲子。他假装漫不经心地接受汤姆的拉拢，简短地回答了他，又继续哼着小调。","At length, it is said, when delay had whetted Tom’s eagerness to the quick, and prepared him to agree to any thing rather than not gain the promised treasure, he met the black man one evening in his usual woodman dress, with his axe on his shoulder, sauntering along the edge of the swamp, and humming a tune.He affected to receive Tom’s advance with great indifference, made brief replies, and went on humming his tune."
"但是汤姆逐渐引他谈起了正事，在转交海盗藏金的条件上，他们开始讨价还价。有个条件是无需说的：大家都明白，凡是恶魔给人好处时都会有这一条。但是还有其他的条件，虽然无关紧要，他却坚决不让步。他坚持，这笔通过他才得到的钱，必须为他服务。因此，他提出汤姆应该把钱用在黑人交易上，也就是说他应该准备一条贩卖奴隶的船只。但是，在这一点上，汤姆坚决拒绝。凭良心说，他虽然已经够道德败坏了，但是魔鬼也没能诱惑他进行奴隶交易。","By degrees, however, Tom brought him to business, and they began to haggle about the terms on which the former was to have the pirate’s treasure.There was one condition which need not be mentioned, being generally understood in all cases where the devil grants favors; but there were others about which, though of less importance, he was inflexibly obstinate.He insisted that the money found through his means should be employed in his service.He proposed, therefore, that Tom should employ it in the black traffic; that is to say, that he should fit out a slave ship.This, however, Tom resolutely refused; he was bad enough, in all conscience; but the devil himself could not tempt him to turn slave dealer."
"他发现汤姆在这一点上很难通融，就不再坚持。但他提出了另一个要求，让他放高利贷，因为魔鬼迫切希望放高利贷的人越多越好，把他们看作自己特有的臣民。","Finding Tom so squeamish on this point, he did not insist upon it, but proposed instead that he should turn usurer; the devil being extremely anxious for the increase of usurers, looking upon them as his peculiar people."
"对于这一点，汤姆没反对，因为这正合他的胃口。","To this no objections were made, for it was just to Tom’s taste."
"“你下个月就在波士顿开一家钱铺。”黑汉说。","“You shall open a broker’s shop in Boston next month,” said the black man."
"“如果你愿意，我明天就开。”汤姆·沃克说道。","“I’ll do it to-morrow, if you wish,” said Tom Walker."
"“你放款利息应该是月息二分。”","“You shall lend money at two per cent a month.”"
"“哎呀，我要收四分！”汤姆·沃克说。","“Egad, I’ll charge four!” replied Tom Walker."
"“你要敲诈证券，取消他们赎回抵押品的权利，逼迫商人破产——”","“You shall extort bonds, foreclose mortgages, drive the merchant to bankruptcy—”"
"“我会逼得他们去死，”汤姆·沃克热切地叫道。","“I’ll drive him to the d—l,” cried Tom Walker, eagerly."
"“你真该为我放高利贷！”老黑怪很高兴地说，“你什么时候要那些钱？”","“You are the usurer for my money!” said the black legs, with delight.“When will you want the rhino?”"
"“就在今晚。”","“This very night.”"
"“成交！”恶魔说。","“Done!” said the devil."
"“一言为定！”汤姆·沃克说道。于是他们握了握手，达成了一笔交易。","“Done!” said Tom Walker.—So they shook hands and struck a bargain."
"几天之后，汤姆·沃克就坐在了波士顿钱铺的办公椅上。他的名气迅速传开，人们都知道他有现款，愿意把钱借给任何肯出大利息的人。人人都记得总督贝尔彻当权的时代，现款极度缺乏。那是一个证券时代。政府债券已经在全国泛滥；知名的土地银行已成立；投机行为肆虐；人们疯狂地谋划新领地，在荒凉的地方建造城市；地皮投机商拿着租地、小镇和埃尔多拉多的地图，到处兜售，但是人们都要把这个谁也不知道在哪儿的地方买下来。总之，在这个国家里，不时爆发的巨大投机热潮已经发展到了令人震惊的地步，人人都想不付出代价就有飞来横财。照例，热潮消退了，美梦破灭了，幻想中的横财也没了，患发财病的人陷入困境。随之而来，全国到处都是“艰难时代”的呼声。","A few days’ time saw Tom Walker seated behind his desk in a counting house in Boston.His reputation for a ready-moneyed man, who would lend money out for a good consideration, soon spread abroad.Every body remembers the days of Governor Belcher, when money was particularly scarce.It was a time of paper credit.The country had been deluged with government bills; the famous Land Bank had been established; there had been a rage for speculating; the people had run mad with schemes for new settlements; for building cities in the wilderness; land jobbers went about with maps of grants, and townships, and Eldorados, lying nobody knew where, but which every body was ready to purchase.In a word, the great speculating fever which breaks out every now and then in the country, had raged to an alarming degree, and body was dreaming of making sudden fortunes from nothing.As usual, the fever had subsided; the dream had gone off, and the imaginary fortunes with it; the patients were left in doleful plight, and the whole country resounded with the consequent cry of “hard times.”"
"就在全社会陷入困境的大好时机下，汤姆·沃克作为一个高利贷者在波士顿开业了。他的店门迅速被蜂拥而至的顾客挤满了。有急需用钱，不惜冒险的人；有孤注一掷的投机商；有做土地梦的地皮投机商；有不知节俭的小商贩；有信用破产的商人。总之，每个人都用尽各种手段，不惜一切代价集资，纷纷涌向汤姆·沃克。","At this propitious time of public distress did Tom Walker set up as a usurer in Boston.His door was soon thronged by customers.The needy and the adventurous; the gambling speculator; the dreaming land jobber; the thriftless tradesman; the merchant with cracked credit; in short, every one driven to raise money by desperate means and desperate sacrifices, hurried to Tom Walker."
"于是，汤姆成了穷人们公认的朋友，他也表现得像一个“患难之交”，也就是说，他一直向他们勒索高息和上好的抵押品。申请人的情况越困难，他的条件就越苛刻。他积累了大量的证券和抵押品，一点一点压榨客户，最后，被压榨成干瘪的海绵一样的客户被他赶出了大门。","Thus Tom was the universal friend of the needy, and he acted like a “friend in need;” that is to say, he always exacted good pay and good security.In proportion to the distress of the applicant was the hardness of his terms.He accumulated bonds and mortgages; gradually squeezed his customers closer and closer; and sent them, at length, dry as a sponge from his door."
"他就是这样一笔一笔地捞了不少钱，变成了有钱有势的人，戴着三角帽在交易所里不可一世。照例,为了炫耀，他给自己建了一所大房子；但由于吝啬，房子的大部分都没有修好，也没有布置，就搁置了。在虚荣心极盛的时候，他甚至还备了一架马车，但他却差点儿把拉车的马饿死；未上油的轮子与轴之间磨得咯吱咯吱响，你会以为听到了被压榨的举债人的阴魂。","In this way he made money hand over hand; became a rich and mighty man, and exalted his cocked hat upon change.He built himself, as usual, a vast house, out of ostentation; but left the greater part of it unfinished and unfurnished out of parsimony.He even set up a carriage in the fullness of his vain-glory, though he nearly starved the horses which drew it; and as the ungreased wheels groaned and screeched on the axle trees, you would have thought you heard the souls of the poor debtors he was squeezing."
"可是，汤姆逐渐老了，心事也逐渐重了。把这个世界的好东西弄到手后，他又开始渴望另一个世界的好东西。他懊恼地想着当初与他的黑朋友约定的交易，开始苦心筹划欺骗他的朋友，不履行那些条件。因此，他突然变成个热衷于去教堂的人。他的祷告声音很大，很有力，好像肺部的力量可以占领天堂一样。事实上，你能从他每个星期日的祷告声中，听出他每周什么时候作孽最重。那些安安静静，一直在虔诚地走向天国的基督徒，惊讶地看到自己被这个半路出家的人超越，都深深陷入自责。汤姆对待宗教事务就像处理财务一样严格。他常常会严厉地监督和斥责邻居，好像每一个记在他们账上的罪过，都会变成他自己账上的功德。他甚至谈论恢复对教友会和再浸礼会教徒迫害的益处。总之，汤姆对宗教的热忱和他的财富一样，臭名昭著。","As Tom waxed old, however, he grew thoughtful.Having secured the good things of this world, he began to feel anxious about those of the next.He thought with regret on the bargain he had made with his black friend, and set his wits to work to cheat him out of the conditions.He became, therefore, all of a sudden, a violent church-goer.He prayed loudly and strenuously as if heaven were to be taken by force of lungs.Indeed, one might always tell when he had sinned most during the week, by the clamor of his Sunday devotion.The quiet Christians who had been modestly and steadfastly travelling Zion-ward, were struck with self-reproach at seeing themselves so suddenly outstripped in their career by this new-made convert.Tom was as rigid in religious, as in money matters; he was a stern supervisor and censurer of his neighbors, and seemed to think every sin entered up to their account became a credit on his own side of the page.He even talked of the expediency of reviving the persecution of quakers and anabaptists.In a word, Tom’s zeal became as notorious as his riches."
"但是，尽管他严格注重宗教形式，心里却总潜伏着一种恐惧，魔鬼最终会回来要账的。为了不至于毫无防备地被抓走，他总在上衣口袋里放一小本圣经。他也在账房的写字台上放一本大的对开圣经，找他做生意的人常常看到他在读经文；这时，他会把绿眼镜放在书上，做个记号，转过头来一如既往地放高利贷。","Still, in spite of all this strenuous attention to forms, Tom had a Lurking dread that the devil, after all, would have his due.That he might not be taken unawares, therefore, it is said he always carried a small Bible in his coat pocket.He had also a great folio Bible on his counting-house desk, and would frequently be found reading it when people called on business; on such occasions he would lay his green spectacles on the book, to mark the place, while he turned round to drive some usurious bargain."
"有人说汤姆上了年纪，有点儿精神错乱，想象自己的末日就要来了，他给马装上新的马蹄铁，配好马鞍，上好笼头，把它四蹄朝上埋了，因为他认为到了末日，这个世界会上下颠倒，这样，他就会发现马已备好，等着他骑上去。他决定在万不得已时，骑马一走了之，逃避他的老朋友。但是，这只是老太婆们的无稽之谈。如果他真的做过这种预先防范，那也完全是多余的，至少古老的传说里是这样讲的。故事结尾如下：","Some say that Tom grew a little crack-brained in his old days, and that fancying his end approaching, he had his horse new shod, saddled and bridled, and buried with his feet uppermost; because he supposed that at the last day the world would be turned upside down; in which case he should find his horse standing ready for mounting, and he was determined at the worst to give his old friend a run for it.This, however, is probably a mere old wives’ fable.If he really did take such a precaution it was totally superfluous; at least so says the authentic old legend, which closes his story in the following manner:"
"一个炎热夏季的午后，黑压压的暴风骤雨就要来了，汤姆正好坐在账房里，戴着白麻纱便帽，穿着印度丝绸晨衣。他正要取消一个倒霉的土地投机商人赎回抵押物的权利，这将使得这位倒霉的投机商完全破产，虽然汤姆声称与之交情深厚。可怜的土地投机商请求给他几个月的宽限。汤姆于是变得愤怒、不耐烦，连推迟一天也不答应。","On one hot afternoon in the dog days, just as a terrible black thunder-gust was coming up, Tom sat in his counting-house in his white linen cap and India silk morning-gown.He was on the point of foreclosing a mortgage, by which he would complete the ruin of an unlucky land speculator for whom he had professed the greatest friendship.The poor land jobber begged him to grant a few months’ indulgence.Tom had grown testy and irritated and refused another day."
"“我将会倾家荡产，一家人只好去救济院。”土地投机商说道。","“My family will be ruined and brought upon the parish,” said the land jobber."
"“仁爱始于家，”汤姆回答，“我在艰难时期首先要照顾自己。”","“Charity begins at home,” replied Tom, “I must take care of myself in these hard times.”"
"“你已经赚了我不少钱了。”投机商人说道。","“You have made so much money out of me,” said the speculator."
"汤姆失去了耐心，也忘了虔诚，说道：“如果我赚了你一丁点儿钱，就让我被魔鬼带走！”","Tom lost his patience and his piety—“The devil take me,” said he, “if I have made a farthing!”"
"这时，街门被人很响地敲了三下。他走出去看看门外是谁。一个黑汉子正在勒住一匹不断嘶鸣，不耐烦地乱蹬乱跳的黑马。","Just then there were three loud knocks at the street door.He stepped out to see who was there.A black man was holding a black horse which neighed and stamped with impatience."
"“汤姆，可找到你了！”黑汉哑着嗓子说。汤姆想缩回去，但是太晚了。他把小本圣经落在了上衣口袋里，大本圣经被桌上正要勾销的抵押凭证盖住了，从没有哪个罪人这么冷不防地被魔鬼捉走。黑汉甩小孩般地把他甩上了马背，用鞭子抽了马一下，驮着汤姆，在暴风雨中飞驰而去。那些职员把笔插在耳朵上，目瞪口呆地透过窗户看着。汤姆·沃克沿着大街，一路飞奔而去，白帽子上下簸动，晨衣在风中飘动，那匹马每跑一步，地面都会冒起火花。等职员再想瞧瞧黑汉时，他已不见踪影了。","“Tom, you’re come for!” said the black fellow, gruffly.Tom shrunk back, but too late.He had left his little Bible at the bottom of his coat pocket, and his big Bible on the desk buried under the mortgage he was about to foreclose: never was sinner taken more unawares.The black man whisked him like a child astride the horse and away he galloped in the midst of a thunder-storm.The clerks stuck their pens behind their ears and stared after him from the windows.Away went Tom Walker, dashing down the street; his white cap bobbing up and down; his morning-gown fluttering in the wind, and his steed striking fire out of the pavement at every bound.When the clerks turned to look for the black man he had disappeared."
"汤姆·沃克再也没回来勾销这张抵押凭证。一个住在沼泽边的乡下人说，在雷雨正急的时候，他听到一路上响亮的马蹄声和呼嚎声。他跑到窗口后，只看到一个影子，就像我所描述的那样，他们骑着疯跑的马，穿过田野，越过山头，一直来到满是黑铁杉的沼泽里，奔向那座印第安古堡。过了一小会儿，一道闪电朝那个方向打过去，整个森林像点着了似的。","Tom Walker never returned to foreclose the mortgage.A countryman who lived on the borders of the swamp, reported that in the height of the thunder-gust he had heard a great clattering of hoofs and a howling along the road, and that when he ran to the window he just caught sight of a figure, such as I have described, on a horse that galloped like mad across the fields, over the hills and down into the black hemlock swamp towards the old Indian fort; and that shortly after a thunder-bolt fell in that direction which seemed to set the whole forest in a blaze."
"波士顿善良的老百姓摇了摇头，耸了耸肩膀。他们从第一次向殖民地移民时起，就已经见惯了巫婆、妖怪和魔鬼的各种把戏，所以他们并没像想象中的那么惊讶。他们委托了几个人保管汤姆的财物。但却没什么好保管的。他们搜查保险箱时，里面所有的债券和抵押凭证都已化为灰烬。装在铁箱子里的金子银子已经变成了木片和刨花了；马厩里躺着两幅枯骨，那两匹饿得半死的马都不见了。第二天，那幢大房子起了火，被夷为平地了。","The good people of Boston shook their heads and shrugged their shoulders, but had been so much accustomed to witches and goblins and tricks of the devil in all kinds of shapes from the first settlement of the colony, that they were not so much horror-struck as might have been expected.Trustees were appointed to take charge of Tom’s effects.There was nothing, however, to administer upon.On searching his coffers all his bonds and mortgages were found reduced to cinders.In place of gold and silver, his iron chest was filled with chips and shavings; two skeletons lay in his stable instead of his half-starved horses, and the very next day his great house took fire and was burnt to the ground."
"这就是汤姆和他的那些不义之财的结局。让所有吝啬的放贷人都把这个故事记在心里吧。这是真实而毋庸置疑的。至今人们还可以看到他从橡树底下掘出基德那笔钱的地洞。每逢狂风暴雨的晚上，附近沼泽和印第安古堡里总会闹鬼，常常会有一个骑在马背上，穿着晨衣，戴着白帽的家伙，那肯定就是放高利贷者的阴魂。事实上，这个故事已经演变成了格言，是新英格兰到处流行的那句名言的起源——魔鬼和汤姆·沃克。","Such was the end of Tom Walker and his ill-gotten wealth.Let all griping money-brokers lay this story to heart.The truth of it is not to be doubted.The very hole under the oak trees, from whence he dug Kidd’s money, is to be seen to this day; and the neighboring swamp and old Indian fort is often haunted in stormy nights by a figure on horseback, in a morning-gown and white cap, which is doubtless the troubled spirit of the usurer.In fact, the story has resolved itself into a proverb, and is the origin of that popular saying prevalent throughout New-England, of “The Devil and Tom Walker.”"
"这些就是我能记起的科德角捕鲸者所讲故事的梗概了。我略掉了一些琐碎的细节，不过当时却让我们很愉快地消磨了一个早晨，直到潮水到来，适合钓鱼的时间过去了，有人提议上岸，在树荫下吃些点心，等待中午炎热退尽。","Such, as nearly as I can recollect, was the tenor of the tale told by the Cape Cod whaler.There were divers trivial particulars which I have omitted, and which wiled away the morning very pleasantly, until the time of tide favorable for fishing being passed, it was proposed that we should go to land, and refresh ourselves under the trees, until the noontide heat should have abated."
"因此，我们就上岸来到了曼哈顿岛的一处阴凉宜人的处所，这里原来归属古老的哈登布鲁克家族。这里我很熟悉，因为我小时候水上探险时常到这来。离我们上岸处不远，有一个古老的荷兰人家的墓穴，就在河边，我和同学很害怕，却也常常拿它编造故事。墓穴里有几副腐烂的棺材，但是我们既害怕又感兴趣，想知道它与位于鬼门关礁石之间的海盗船残骸的关系。有些走私故事也和它有关，尤其是当这个荒僻的地方属于一个绰号为“现款普雷沃斯特”的有名人物的那个时期，大家常悄悄地说他与海外各地都有多次秘密来往。不过，这些事与童年听到的故事混作一团，我们也搞不清楚了。","We accordingly landed on a delectable part of the island of Mannahatta, in that shady and embowered tract formerly under dominion of the ancient family of the Hardenbrooks.It was a spot well known to me in the course of the aquatic expeditions of my boyhood.Not far from where we landed, was an old Dutch family vault, in the side of a bank, which had been an object of great awe and fable among my schoolboy associates.There were several mouldering coffins within; but what gave it a fearful interest with us, was its being connected in our minds with the pirate wreck which lay among the rocks of Hell Gate.There were also stories of smuggling connected with it, particularly during a time that this retired spot was owned by a noted burgher called Ready Money Prevost; a man of whom it was whispered that he had many and mysterious dealings with parts beyond seas.All these things, however, had been jumbled together in our minds in that vague way in which such things are mingled up in the tales of boyhood."
"当我想着这些事的时候，我的伙伴们从装的满满的食篮里拿出了食物铺开。在这炎热的中午，我们在一棵大栗树底下的阴凉处，坐在一直延伸到河边的绿毯子上，享受起来。我懒懒地坐在草地上，回想童年关于这个地方的许多朦胧记忆，像记不清楚的梦的片段一样，重复讲给同伴听，就当作消遣。我讲完后，一位可敬的老先生约翰·乔斯·范德尔莫尔，就是从前给我讲道尔夫·海利格奇遇的老先生，打破了沉默，讲起了他记得的附近发生的一个掘金的故事。我们知道，他是州上讲话最可靠的人之一，就求他把细节讲给我们听，于是，我们便用干净的长烟斗，抽着布拉斯克·摩尔的烟丝，振作精神，可靠的约翰·乔斯·范德尔莫尔便讲起了这样的故事。","While I was musing upon these matters my companions had spread a repast, from the contents of our well-stored pannier, and we solaced ourselves during the warm sunny hours of mid-day under the shade of a broad chestnut, on the cool grassy carpet that swept down to the water’s edge.While lolling on the grass I summoned up the dusky recollections of my boyhood respecting this place, and repeated them like the imperfectly remembered traces of a dream, for the entertainment of my companions.When I had finished, a worthy old burgher, John Josse Vandermoere, the same who once related to me the adventures of Dolph Heyliger, broke silence and observed, that he recollected a story about money-digging which occurred in this very neighborhood.As we knew him to be one of the most authentic narrators of the province we begged him to let us have the particulars, and accordingly, while we refreshed ourselves with a clean long pipe of Blase Moore’s tobacco, the authentic John Josse Vandermoere related the following tale."
