"第一章 波尼族印第安人的狩猎场","CHAPTER I. THE PAWNEE HUNTING-GROUNDS."
"——旅行同伴们——一位专员——一位艺术大师——一个探险家——边境上的吉尔·布拉斯——一个年轻人对快乐的期待","—TRAVELLING COMPANIONS.—A COMMISSIONER.—A VIRTUOSO.—A SEEKER OF ADVENTURES.—A GIL BLAS OF THE FRONTIER.—A YOUNG MAN’S ANTICIPATIONS OF PLEASURE."
"远西区位于密西西比河畔几百英里外，是一个时常受到大家吹捧的地方。这里绵延着一大片无人居住的土地，既看不到白人的大木屋，也瞧不见印第安人的小棚屋。这里有广袤的草原，有大大小小的树丛点缀其间，并有阿肯色河、加拿大的格兰德河、雷德河和它们的支流缓缓流过。在这肥沃而青翠的大荒原上还游荡着麋鹿、野牛和野马。它们都在这自由的国度里驰骋。事实上，这些地区便是远西区各个部落的狩猎场。那边有奥塞奇人、克里克人、特拉华人，以及其他一些被教化了的部落。他们就住在白人定居者的周围。这边也游弋着波尼族人、科曼奇人的部落，和其他一些凶狠且依然保持独立的部落、大草原上的游牧部落或是落基山脉周边的居民。我所提到的这些地区是这些敌对部落的必争之地，他们都不敢在这里划分边界建立一个永久居住区。在狩猎季节，猎手们和“勇士们”大批地奔赴那边，搭建起暂时的狩猎营地——用树皮和兽皮覆盖着的轻巧的遮阴棚。他们大肆屠杀着大草原上不计其数的食草兽群，满载鹿肉和野牛肉而归；同时，他们还得小心提防危险的邻族。这些冒险远征常常需要人们有尚武的品性：猎手们全副武装，随时准备战斗；他们都充满了攻击性和防卫性，而且必须时刻保持警惕。他们一旦在长途跋涉中遇到敌对部落的猎手，残酷的冲突便不可避免了。他们的营地也总是受到四处游荡的战争团伙的偷袭。猎手们在分散开来追击猎物时，还可能会被埋伏的敌人逮捕或屠杀。在某个阴森的深谷中，水流正冲刷着支离破碎的颅骨和骨架；或者在被遗弃的狩猎营地附近，常常有蛛丝马迹表明，这里曾经有过一场血战，提醒路人他正行走在一个危险的地带。接下来的文字将会描述一次在上述狩猎区里为期一个月的远足——穿越一块尚未被白人开发的地区。","In the often vaunted regions of the Far West, several hundred miles beyond the Mississippi, extends a vast tract of uninhabited country, where there is neither to be seen the log-house of the white man, nor the wigwam of the Indian.It consists of great grassy plains, interspersed with forests and groves, and clumps of trees, and watered by the Arkansas, the Grand Canadian, the Red River, and their tributary streams.Over these fertile and verdant wastes still roam the elk, the buffalo, and the wild horse, in all their native freedom.These, in fact, are the hunting grounds of the various tribes of the Far West.Thither repair the Osage, the Creek, the Delaware and other tribes that have linked themselves with civilization, and live within the vicinity of the white settlements.Here resort also, the Pawnees, the Comanches, and other fierce, and as yet independent tribes, the nomads of the prairies, or the inhabitants of the skirts of the Rocky Mountains.The regions I have mentioned form a debatable ground of these warring and vindictive tribes; none of them presume to erect a permanent habitation within its borders.Their hunters and “Braves” repair thither in numerous bodies during the season of game, throw up their transient hunting camps, consisting of light bowers covered with bark and skins, commit sad havoc among the innumerable herds that graze the prairies, and having loaded themselves with venison and buffalo meat, warily retire from the dangerous neighborhood.These expeditions partake, always, of a warlike character: the hunters are all armed for action, offensive and defensive, and are bound to incessant vigilance.Should they, in their excursions, meet the hunters of an adverse tribe, savage conflicts take place.Their encampments, too, are always subject to be surprised by wandering war parties, and their hunters, when scattered in pursuit of game, to be captured or massacred by lurking foes.Mouldering skulls and skeletons, bleaching in some dark ravine, or near the traces of a hunting camp, occasionally mark the scene of a foregone act of blood, and let the wanderer know the dangerous nature of the region he is traversing.It is the purport of the following pages to narrate a month’s excursion to these noted hunting grounds, through a tract of country which had not as yet been explored by white men."
"我是在1832年10月初到达吉布森要塞的。那是远西区的一个边防站，坐落在尼欧肖河或是格兰德河上，河水就在不远处汇入了阿肯色河。我之前已经和一队来自圣路易斯的人沿着密苏里河河岸逆流而上，跋涉了一个月。沿途经过了一些坐落于密苏里州与阿肯色州交界地带上的代理行和教堂。一位由美国政府任命的专员带领着我们这队人行进。他的任务是管理印第安部落从密西西比河以东向西迁移的安居工作。在履行职责的过程中，他走访了各种各样开化了的边远地区。","It was early in October, 1832, that I arrived at Fort Gibson, a frontier post of the Far West, situated on the Neosho, or Grand River, near its confluence with the Arkansas.I had been travelling for a month past, with a small party from St. Louis, up the banks of the Missouri, and along the frontier line of agencies and missions that extends from the Missouri to the Arkansas.Our party was headed by one of the Commissioners appointed by the government of the United States, to superintend the settlement of the Indian tribes migrating from the east to the west of the Mississippi.In the discharge of his duties, he was thus visiting the various outposts of civilization."
"在这里，请容许我对我们这个小团队的可敬领队赞美几句。他是康涅狄格州上一个小镇的居民，一个尽管经历了长期的法律实践与政坛生涯，但仍然保持着与生俱来的淳朴与仁慈之心的人。在康涅狄格河宁静的河畔，他的大部分时间用在了处理家族内部事务及与执事、长老、市政委员的社交上。可在这时，他突然被征召骑上他的战马，挎上步枪，在渺无人烟的远西区荒原上与半裸的猎人、偏远林区的居民及赤裸的野蛮人混在一起。","And here let me bear testimony to the merits of this worthy leader of our little band.He was a native of one of the towns of Connecticut, a man in whom a course of legal practice and political life had not been able to vitiate an innate simplicity and benevolence of heart.The greater part of his days had been passed in the bosom of his family and the society of deacons, elders, and selectmen, on the peaceful banks of the Connecticut; when suddenly he had been called to mount his steed, shoulder his rifle, and mingle among stark hunters, backwoodsmen, and naked savages, on the trackless wilds of the Far West."
"L.先生是我的另一个旅伴。他出生于英国，却是外国人的后裔，有着欧洲大陆人与生俱来的乐观与随和。因为游历过许多国家，所以从某种意义上来说，他已经成为一个具有很强的适应能力的世界公民了。他身兼数职：植物学家、地质学家、甲虫和蝴蝶的捕捉者、业余音乐爱好者、毫不虚饰的素描画家。总之，他是一个彻头彻尾的艺术大师。另外，他还是一个并不总是很成功却不屈不挠的运动员。没有一个人像他那样同时要做很多事情，也因此没有一个人像他一样越忙越快乐。","Another of my fellow-travellers was Mr. L., an Englishman by birth, but descended from a foreign stock; and who had all the buoyancy and accommodating spirit of a native of the Continent.Having rambled over many countries, he had become, to a certain degree, a citizen of the world, easily adapting himself to any change.He was a man of a thousand occupations; a botanist, a geologist, a hunter of beetles and butterflies, a musical amateur, a sketcher of no mean pretensions, in short, a complete virtuoso; added to which, he was a very indefatigable, if not always a very successful, sportsman.Never had a man more irons in the fire, and, consequently, never was man more busy nor more cheerful."
"我的第三个旅伴是陪着L.先生从欧洲来的一位先生，他就像忒勒马科斯一样陪同在他左右，更准确地说，就像他的复制品，总是偶尔给他的“良师益友”带来些困惑和不安。他是一个年轻的瑞士伯爵，不到二十一岁，才华横溢，充满活力，但却兴奋得过了度，总是想去尝试各种疯狂的冒险。","My third fellow-traveller was one who had accompanied the former from Europe, and travelled with him as his Telemachus; being apt, like his prototype, to give occasional perplexity and disquiet to his Mentor.He was a young Swiss Count, scarce twenty-one years of age, full of talent and spirit, but galliard in the extreme, and prone to every kind of wild adventure."
"介绍了我的伙伴们之后，我不得不提及一个不容忽视的人物。他虽然地位低下，却不可或缺、至关重要：护卫、马夫、厨师、支帐篷的人……概括来说，他就是个总管，并且我还想补充一句：他是我们队伍中最爱管闲事和最喜欢捣蛋的人。此人个头不高、又黑又瘦，是法国人与非洲人的混血儿，名叫安托万，但人们亲切地称之为托尼什——一种边境上的吉尔·布拉斯。他过着一种杂乱的生活：有时混迹于白人当中，有时出入于印第安部落，有时受雇于商人、传教士或印第安雇主，有时又加入到奥赛奇人的狩猎队之中。我们在圣路易斯带上了他。在圣路易斯附近，他有一个小农场、一个印第安妻子和一大群同母异父的孩子。然而据他自己所说，他在每个部落都有一个妻子。事实上，如果这个矮小的流浪者所说的关于自己的一切都属实的话，那他就是一个没有道德、没有社会地位、没有原则、没有国家甚至没有自己语言的人，因为他说的是一口夹杂着法语、英语和奥赛奇语的行话。此外，他是个声名狼藉的吹牛者和一流的撒谎者。听他夸夸其谈地讲述他那些令人胆战心惊的英勇行为，以及在战场上、打猎时在千钧一发之际死里逃生的经历是一件很有趣的事。在他口若悬河地讲故事的时候，有时会因一阵阵的大喘气而中断下来，就像他颌上的筋突然出现了错乱；但我更愿意认为这是他被自己脱口而出的谎话噎到了，因为通常我接下来都会马上意识到这是一个弥天大谎。","Having made this mention of my comrades, I must not pass over unnoticed, a personage of inferior rank, but of all-pervading and prevalent importance: the squire, the groom, the cook, the tent man, in a word, the factotum, and, I may add, the universal meddler and marplot of our party.This was a little swarthy, meagre, French creole, named Antoine, but familiarly dubbed Tonish: a kind of Gil Blas of the frontier, who had passed a scrambling life, sometimes among white men, sometimes among Indians; sometimes in the employ of traders, missionaries, and Indian agents; sometimes mingling with the Osage hunters.We picked him up at St. Louis, near which he had a small farm, an Indian wife, and a brood of half-blood children.According to his own account, however, he had a wife in every tribe; in fact, if all this little vagabond said of himself were to be believed, he was without morals, without caste, without creed, without country, and even without language; for he spoke a jargon of mingled French, English, and Osage.He was, withal, a notorious braggart, and a liar of the first water.It was amusing to hear him vapor and gasconade about his terrible exploits and hairbreadth escapes in war and hunting.In the midst of his volubility, he was prone to be seized by a spasmodic gasping, as if the springs of his jaws were suddenly unhinged; but I am apt to think it was caused by some falsehood that stuck in his throat, for I generally remarked that immediately afterward there bolted forth a lie of the first magnitude."
"这是一次愉快的旅行，有时我们会住在印第安传教士们的相隔很远的屋子里，但大多数时候，我们在野外靠近溪流的幽静小树林里搭建营地，睡在帐篷里。在行程的后半段，我们往前赶了赶路，希望能够及时赶到吉布森要塞，跟奥赛奇族进行秋季大草原野牛狩猎的猎手们一道而行。实际上，那位年轻的伯爵已经因对这个事的想象而兴奋不已了。大草原壮丽的风景和桀骜不驯的个性已经使他痴迷不已了，并且小托尼什给他讲的关于印第安勇士和美女、关于猎杀野牛和捕捉野马的故事，都使他想要急切地冲到原始生活中去。他是个勇敢而骑技高超的骑士，渴望逐鹿草原。听他充满青春活力地描述和印第安人混在一起，加入他们艰苦的探险时，他预计将会看到什么、会做什么和享受什么，是件很有意思的事。但更有意思的是听小托尼什吹牛。他自愿在伯爵所有的危险活动中做他忠实的侍从：教他如何捕捉野马、放倒野牛，以及赢得印第安公主的芳心。——“要是我们能看到燃烧的大草原就好了。”年轻的伯爵说。——“到那时，我要亲自点火。”小法国人大叫着说。","Our route had been a pleasant one, quartering ourselves, occasionally, at the widely separated establishments of the Indian missionaries, but in general camping out in the fine groves that border the streams, and sleeping under cover of a tent.During the latter part of our tour we had pressed forward, in hopes of arriving in time at Fort Gibson to accompany the Osage hunters on their autumnal visit to the buffalo prairies.Indeed the imagination of the young Count had become completely excited on the subject.The grand scenery and wild habits of the prairies had set his spirits madding, and the stories that little Tonish told him of Indian braves and Indian beauties, of hunting buffaloes and catching wild horses, had set him all agog for a dash into savage life.He was a bold and hard rider, and longed to be scouring the hunting grounds.It was amusing to hear his youthful anticipations of all that he was to see, and do, and enjoy, when mingling among the Indians and participating in their hardy adventure; and it was still more amusing to listen to the gasconadings of little Tonish, who volunteered to be his faithful squire in all his perilous undertakings; to teach him how to catch the wild horse, bring down the buffalo, and win the smiles of Indian princesses;—“And if we can only get sight of a prairie on fire!” said the young Count—“By Gar, Ill set one on fire myself!” cried the little Frenchman."
"第二章 期望落空","CHAPTER II. ANTICIPATIONS DISAPPOINTED."
"——新的计划——准备加入一支探险队——从吉布森要塞启程——弗迪格里斯河的浅滩——一个印第安骑士","—NEW PLANS.—PREPARATIONS TO JOIN AN EXPLORING PARTY.—DEPARTURE FROM FORT GIBSON.—FORDING OF THE VERDIGRIS.—AN INDIAN CAVALIER."
"年轻人的期待往往以失望告终。在我们的行程结束之前，伯爵想要参加野外狩猎的计划就不幸落空了；我们听说奥塞奇的猎手们已经踏上前往野牛出没地区的征程了。可伯爵依然决定，如果有可能的话，他将循着他们的踪迹行走，赶上他们。为此，他在距离吉布森要塞几英里的奥塞奇事务所作了短暂的停留，以询问相关情况和作些准备工作。和他一起留下来的是他的旅伴L.先生，而那位专员和我则继续前往吉布森要塞。一路跟着我们的还有忠诚而又可靠的托尼什。我暗示他，他曾许下承诺要跟随伯爵参加狩猎，却发现这个小跟班只关注自己的利益。他意识到，专员因为他的工作职责，将会在这个地区停留很长一段时间，并很有可能一直雇佣他，而伯爵则只是短暂地停留。这个小吹牛者也就突然间三缄其口了。他不再对年轻的伯爵说任何关于印第安人、野牛及野马之类的事，转而默默地跟着专员的队伍，一路安静地跟着我们前往要塞。","The anticipations of a young man are prone to meet with disappointment.Unfortunately for the Count’s scheme of wild campaigning, before we reached the end of our journey; we heard that the Osage hunters had set forth upon their expedition to the buffalo grounds.The Count still determined, if possible, to follow on their track and overtake them, and for this purpose stopped short at the Osage Agency, a few miles distant from Fort Gibson, to make inquiries and preparations.His travelling companion, Mr. L., stopped with him; while the Commissioner and myself proceeded to Fort Gibson, followed by the faithful and veracious Tonish.I hinted to him his promises to follow the Count in his campaignings, but I found the little varlet had a keen eye to self-interest.He was aware that the Commissioner, from his official duties, would remain for a long time in the country, and be likely to give him permanent employment, while the sojourn of the Count would be but transient.The gasconading of the little braggart was suddenly therefore at an end.He spake not another word to the young Count about Indians, buffaloes, and wild horses, but putting himself tacitly in the train of the Commissioner, jogged silently after us to the garrison."
"然而，一到达要塞，一个漫游大草原的新机会呈现在我们眼前。我们了解到，一队巡逻骑兵，或者是步枪手在三天前刚出发。他们要进行一次从阿肯色河到雷德河的大范围的野外考察，其中还包括一块白人从未涉足过的波尼族人的狩猎地。也就是说，我们有机会在强大护卫队的保护下穿越这些危险而有趣的地区，因为专员可以借着职务之便要求这队新建的步枪手为他效劳，而且他们将要考察的地区也是他此次任务中一些游牧部落的指定定居点。","On arriving at the fort, however, a new chance presented itself for a cruise on the prairies.We learnt that a company of mounted rangers, or riflemen, had departed but three days previous to make a wide exploring tour from the Arkansas to the Red River, including a part of the Pawnee hunting grounds where no party of white men had as yet penetrated.Here, then, was an opportunity of ranging over those dangerous and interesting regions under the safeguard of a powerful escort; for the Commissioner, in virtue of his office, could claim the service of this newly raised corps of riflemen, and the country they were to explore was destined for the settlement of some of the migrating tribes connected with his mission."
"我们立马制定了计划并即刻付诸实施。吉普森要塞的指挥官派出几个克里克族印第安人去传急令。这几个人要赶上巡逻队并让他们停止行进，直到专员和他的人马与他们会合。由于我们在赶上巡逻队前，还要在野地里行进三到四天，所以指挥官将一支由十四个骑兵步枪手组成的护卫队指派给了我们，并让陆军中尉带队指挥。","Our plan was promptly formed and put into execution.A couple of Creek Indians were sent off express, by the commander of Fort Gibson, to overtake the rangers and bring them to a halt until the Commissioner and his party should be able to join them.As we should have a march of three or four days through a wild country before we could overtake the company of rangers, an escort of fourteen mounted riflemen, under the command of a lieutenant, was assigned us."
"我们给还在奥塞奇事务所的年轻伯爵及L.先生传话过去，向他们说了我们的新计划及其预期，并邀请他们与我们同行。然而，伯爵却忘不掉他对自己的承诺——要过一种充满乐趣的、真正原始的生活。在回复中，他说他愿意与我们同行，直到我们发现奥塞奇族猎手的踪迹，因为他立志要追随奥塞奇族的猎手，与旷野融为一体。而他忠实的“良师益友”，尽管为这个疯狂的计划而感到悲伤，但还是出于朋友的忠诚而没有离弃他。我们初步约定，第二天早上在事务所与护卫队会合。","We sent word to the young Count and Mr. L. at the Osage Agency; of our new plan and prospects, and invited them to accompany us.The Count, however, could not forego the delights he had promised himself in mingling with absolutely savage life.In reply; he agreed to keep with us until we should come upon the trail of the Osage hunters, when it was his fixed resolve to strike off into the wilderness in pursuit of them; and his faithful Mentor, though he grieved at the madness of the scheme, was too stanch a friend to desert him.A general rendezvous of our party and escort was appointed, for the following morning, at the Agency."
"我们现在已经作好了充分准备，可以即刻启程。到目前为止，我们的行李由一辆轻便马车拉着，但是马上就要穿越一块无人涉足的地区，一路上将会遇到溪流、沟壑及灌木丛。在这些地方，像马车这样的交通工具是很难通过的。我们将采取猎人的做法——骑在马背上行进，负担越少越好。因此，我们对行李进行了一次严格的、最大幅度的精简。每个人的马背上都搭着一副塞得满满的鞍囊，但也仅够放下少量衣服和自己的大外套。其他的行李则放在驮马上。每人都有一张睡觉用的熊皮和两条毯子，还有一顶庇护用的帐篷，以防生病或遇到坏天气。我们又留心自带了些面粉、咖啡和糖，以及少量用于紧急情况的咸猪肉，因为我们将主要依靠打猎获取食物。","We now made all arrangements for prompt departure.Our baggage had hitherto been transported on a light wagon, but we were now to break our way through an untravelled country, cut up by rivers, ravines, and thickets, where a vehicle of the kind would be a complete impediment.We were to travel on horseback, in hunter’s style, and with as little encumbrance as possible.Our baggage, therefore, underwent a rigid and most abstemious reduction.A pair of saddle-bags, and those by no means crammed, sufficed for each man’s scanty wardrobe, and, with his great coat, were to be carried upon the steed he rode.The rest of the baggage was placed on pack-horses.Each one had a bear-skin and a couple of blankets for bedding, and there was a tent to shelter us in case of sickness or bad weather.We took care to provide ourselves with flour, coffee, and sugar, together with a small supply of salt pork for emergencies; for our main subsistence we were to depend upon the chase."
"在我们最近的行程中，还没有被累坏的马继续跟着我们，用来当作驮马或备用马匹。但是旅程漫长而又艰辛，其间我们还将不时打猎，而且，万一遇到敌对的野蛮人，骑手的安全往往就取决于他骑的马的好坏，所以我们很小心地分配着马匹。我得到一匹强壮的银灰色的马，它有点儿粗野，但忠实有力，还有那匹先前一直骑着的、吃苦耐劳的矮种马。它有些疲惫了，所以我让它与那些驮马一起慢慢行进，以备不时之需。","Such of our horses as had not been tired out in our recent journey, were taken with us as pack-horses, or supernumeraries; but as we were going on a long and rough tour, where there would be occasional hunting, and where, in case of meeting with hostile savages, the safety of the rider might depend upon the goodness of his steed, we took care to be well mounted.I procured a stout silver-gray, somewhat rough, but stanch and powerful; and reigned a hardy pony which I had hitherto ridden, and which, being somewhat jaded, was suffered to ramble along with the pack-horses, to be mounted only in case of emergency."
"所有这些工作做完后，我们于10月10日早上离开了吉布森要塞，穿过了前面的那条河，出发前往事务所赴约。骑了几英里之后，我们来到了弗迪格里斯河的浅滩，一大片乱石横陈于树林的旁边。我们便从河岸上下来，排成稀稀拉拉的纵队，依次过河。马匹小心翼翼地踩着一块块石头前行，在湍急而喧哗的水流中谨慎地探寻立足点。","All these arrangements being made, we left Fort Gibson, on the morning of the tenth of October, and crossing the river in front of it, set off for the rendezvous at the Agency.A ride of a few miles brought us to the ford of the Verdigris, a wild rocky scene overhung with forest trees.We descended to the bank of the river and crossed in straggling file, the horses stepping cautiously from rock to rock, and in a manner feeling about for a foothold beneath the rushing and brawling stream."
"和驮马一起殿后的是我们的小个子法国人托尼什。他感觉自己得到了某种程度的提拔，因而非常高兴。在我们之前的行程中，他一直在赶马车，这在他看来好像是一项非常低级的差事，而现在他成了马的主人了。","Our little Frenchman, Tonish, brought up the rear with the pack-horses.He was in high glee, having experienced a kind of promotion.In our journey hitherto he had driven the wagon, which he seemed to consider a very inferior employ; now he was master of the horse."
"他像一只栖息在树上的猴子一样坐在一匹马上，边唱边喊，并像印第安人那样高声尖叫。他还不停地用他那夹杂着法语、英语和奥塞奇语的行话咒骂那些什么也听不懂的慵散驮马。","He sat perched like a monkey behind the on one of the horses; he sang, he shouted, he yelped like an Indian, and ever and anon blasphemed the loitering pack-horses in his jargon of mingled French, English, and, Osage, which not one of them could understand."
"穿越浅滩时，我们看到河岸对面有一个骑在马背上的克里克族印第安人。他停在一个岩石壁上观察我们，变成了一道如画般的风景，与他周围的自然风景和谐地融为一体。他身上穿着一件明亮的饰以鲜红色边的蓝色狩猎上衣，头上包着一块色彩明快、有点儿像穆斯林头巾的手帕。这手帕的一端从他的耳边垂下来。他手里拿着一支长步枪，看起来像是一个游荡在野外的阿拉伯人。我们那饶舌又爱管闲事的小个子法国人，用他那粗野的行话对他大喊大叫，但那野蛮人在满足了自己的好奇心之后，摇了摇头，便调转马头，沿着河岸飞奔而去，很快就消失在树林之中。","As we were crossing the ford we saw on the opposite shore a Creek Indian on horseback.He had paused to reconnoitre us from the brow of a rock, and formed a picturesque object, in unison with the wild scenery around him.He wore a bright blue hunting-shirt trimmed with scarlet fringe; a gayly colored handkerchief was bound round his head something like a turban, with one end hanging down beside his ear; he held a long rifle in his hand, and looked like a wild Arab on the prowl.Our loquacious and ever-meddling little Frenchman called out to him in his Babylonish jargon, but the savage having satisfied his curiosity tossed his head in the air, turned the head of his steed, and galloping along the shore soon disappeared among the trees."
"第三章 一个印第安人的事务所","CHAPTER III. AN INDIAN AGENCY."
"——步枪手——奥塞奇人、克里克人、设阱捕兽者、猎狗、马匹、混血儿——猎手贝蒂","—RIFLEMEN.—OSAGES, CREEKS, TRAPPERS, DOGS, HORSES, HALF-BREEDS.—BEATTE, THE HUNTSMAN."
"越过浅滩之后，我们很快便来到了奥塞奇事务所。在这里，肖托上校有他自己的办公室和弹药库，用来处理印第安人事务及分发礼物和供给品。事务所由几间建在河两岸上的木屋组成，呈现出一片光怪陆离的边塞景象。我们的护卫队就在这里等待着我们的到来。他们中有的人骑在马背上，有的站着，有的坐在倒在地上的树的树干上，还有的在瞄准目标。他们是一群杂七杂八的人：一些人穿着绿色毛毯做的礼服大衣；另一些人穿着皮制狩猎装。但大多数人穿的是令人目瞪口呆的、裁剪不当的衣服，简直就没法穿；他们显然是为了这次艰苦的行程才穿上的。","Having crossed the ford, we soon reached the Osage Agency, where Col. Choteau has his offices and magazines, for the despatch of Indian affairs, and the distribution of presents and supplies.It consisted of a few log houses on the banks of the river, and presented a motley frontier scene.Here was our escort awaiting our arrival; some were on horseback, some on foot, some seated on the trunks of fallen trees, some shooting at a mark.They were a heterogeneous crew; some in frock-coats made of green blankets; others in leathern hunting-shirts, but the most part in marvellously ill-cut garments, much the worse for wear, and evidently put on for rugged service."
"在这些人旁边的是一群奥塞奇人：一些庄重的家伙，着装和面容都严厉而朴素。他们没有戴任何的装饰品，他们的装束就只是毯子、绑腿和莫卡辛鞋。他们的头顶光光的，头发剪得非常短，只是在头顶上留了笔直的一撮，就像是头盔上的羽冠一样，还有一绺长长的头发拖在后面。他们有罗马人俊美的面容和宽阔的胸膛；而且他们大多都只把毯子裹到腰部，所以上半身和胳膊便裸露在外面，这使他们看上去就像高贵的青铜像。到目前为止，我在西部看到的最俊美的印第安人便是奥塞奇人。那时，他们还没有完全向近在咫尺的文明势力屈服，也没有丢掉自己作为猎手和武士的天性；并且贫穷也使他们无法放纵于奢华的服饰中。","Near by these was a group of Osages: stately fellows; stern and simple in garb and aspect.They wore no ornaments; their dress consisted merely of blankets, leggings, and moccasons.Their heads were bare; their hair was cropped close, excepting a bristling ridge on the top, like the crest of a helmet, with a long scalp-lock hanging behind.They had fine Roman countenances, and broad deep chests; and, as they generally wore their blankets wrapped round their loins, so as to leave the bust and arms bare, they looked like so many noble bronze figures.The Osages are the finest looking Indians I have ever seen in the West.They have not yielded sufficiently, as yet, to the influence of civilization to lay by their simple Indian garb, or to lose the habits of the hunter and the warrior; and their poverty prevents their indulging in much luxury of apparel."
"一群衣着华丽的克里克人与他们形成了鲜明对比。一眼瞥过去，你会发现这个部落的人外貌有些东方人的特点。他们穿着五光十色的棉布狩猎衬衫，上面装饰着鲜艳的花边；腰间束着宽宽的腰带，上面缀着珠子；他们的绑腿有的是用鹿皮做的，有的是用绿色或红色的布做的，上面饰以膝带和流苏；他们的莫卡辛鞋也做工巧妙，装饰精美；他们头上还高雅地围着华丽的手帕。","In contrast to these was a gayly dressed party of Creeks.There is something, at the first glance, quite oriental in the appearance of this tribe.They dress in calico hunting shirts, of various brilliant colors, decorate with bright fringes, and belted with broad girdles, embroidered with beads; they have leggings of dressed deer skins, or of green or scarlet cloth, with embroidered knee-bands and tassels; their moccasons are fancifully wrought and ornamented, and they wear gaudy handkerchiefs tastefully bound round their heads."
"除了这些人之外，还有几个拥有各种肤色的设阱捕兽者、猎人、混血儿、克里奥尔人、黑人，以及那些游荡在边境上、难以区分的乌合之众。他们出入于文明世界和野蛮生活之间，就像那些犹豫不决的鸟儿和蝙蝠徘徊于光明与黑暗之间一样。","Besides these, there was a sprinkling of trappers, hunters, half-breeds, creoles, negroes of every hue; and all that other rabble rout of nondescript beings that keep about the frontiers, between civilised and savage life, as those equivocal birds, the bats, hover about the confines of light and darkness."
"事务所所在的这个小村庄一片繁忙，特别是准备用具的铁匠铺：一个魁梧的黑人正在给一匹马钉蹄铁，两个混血儿正在制作铁匙，这是用来熔化铅做子弹用的。一个设阱捕兽的老人穿着皮制狩猎装和莫卡辛鞋，把自己的步枪靠工作台放着，一边指挥着操作，一边闲扯着他的狩猎经历。几条大狗或是悠闲地进出店铺，或是在阳光下打盹；一只小野狗歪着脑袋，竖起一只耳朵，带着小狗们惯有的好奇心看着给马钉蹄铁的过程，好像是在研究这门艺术，又或者是在等着轮到铁匠给自己钉蹄铁。","The little hamlet of the Agency was in a complete bustle; the blacksmith’s shed, in particular, was a scene of preparation; a strapping negro was shoeing a horse; two half-breeds were fabricating iron spoons in which to melt lead for bullets.An old trapper, in leathern hunting frock and moccasons, had placed his rifle against a work-bench, while he superintended the operation, and gossiped about his hunting exploits; several large dogs were lounging in and out of the shop, or sleeping in the sunshine, while a little cur, with head cocked on one side, and one ear erect, was watching, with that curiosity common to little dogs, the process of shoeing the horse, as if studying the art, or waiting for his turn to be shod."
"我们找到了伯爵和他的同伴，这个所谓的“艺术大师”已经为这段旅程作好了准备。由于他们想赶上奥塞奇人，花点儿时间和他们一起围猎野牛和野马，所以他们也相应地作好了准备：除了用于旅行的马匹之外，他们还准备了一些上等的好马。这些马在行进时跟着大家，只在追赶野牛、野马时才骑。","We found the Count and his companion, the Virtuoso, ready for the march.As they intended to overtake the Osages, and pass some time in hunting the buffalo and the wild horse, they had provided themselves accordingly; having, in addition to the steeds which they used for travelling, others of prime quality, which were to be led when on the march, and only to be mounted for the chase."
"此外，他们还雇佣了一个叫安托万的年轻人，他是法国人和奥塞奇人的混血儿。他什么活都要干：做饭、打猎、照看马匹，但是他却总想什么也不做。和家里那些没出息的子女一样，他也是在父亲执行任务期间出生并长大成人的。另外，作为一个公认的英俊青年，一个边境上的阿多尼斯，他有点儿被宠坏了，又因为他姐姐是一个阔绰的白种商人的情妇，所以他有些想入非非，继而变得更加过分。","They had, moreover, engaged the services of a young man named Antoine, a half-breed of French and Osage origin.He was to be a kind of Jack-of-all-work; to cook, to hunt, and to take care of the horses; but he had a vehement propensity to do nothing, being one of the worthless brood engendered and brought up among the missions.He was, moreover, a little spoiled by being really a handsome young fellow, an Adonis of the frontier, and still worse by fancying himself highly connected, his sister being concubine to an opulent white trader!"
"从我们这方面来说，专员和我都渴望在出发前能够再找到一个精通森林知识的随从，他或许还可以做我们的猎手。因为我们的小个子法国人已经因搭帐篷、做饭和行进时照看驮马而忙得团团转了。于是就有一个这样的人出现在了我们面前，或者不如说是被推荐给了我们，他就是皮埃尔·贝蒂，一个法国人和奥塞奇人的混血儿。推荐他的人向我们保证说：他对这片土地的每个地方都非常熟悉，在狩猎和作战期间，他走遍了这个地方，所以他既可以是向导，又可以是翻译，而且他还是一个一流的猎手。","For our own parts, the Commissioner and myself were desirous, before setting out, to procure another attendant well versed in woodcraft, who might serve us as a hunter; for our little Frenchman would have his hands full when in camp, in cooking, and on the march, in taking care of the pack-horses.Such an one presented himself, or rather was recommended to us, in Pierre Beatte, a half-breed of French and Osage parentage.We were assured that he was acquainted with all parts of the country, having traversed it in all directions, both in hunting and war parties; that he would be of use both as guide and interpreter, and that he was a first-rate hunter."
"老实说，当他第一次出现在我面前时，我并不喜欢他的样子。他当时穿着一身破旧的狩猎装，系着鹿皮绑腿，正在四处瞎逛。他浑身脏兮兮的，满是油污，整身衣服由于经常穿，像是油漆过一样。他看上去大约三十六岁，胸膛宽阔，身体强壮。他的相貌也还不算太糟，跟拿破仑有几分相似，只不过棱角更加分明，他还有着印第安人特有的高颧骨。","I confess I did not like his looks when he was first presented to me.He was lounging about, in an old hunting frock and metasses or leggings, of deer skin, soiled and greased, and almost japanned by constant use.He was apparently about thirty-six years of age, square and strongly built.His features were not bad, being shaped not unlike those of Napoleon, but sharpened up, with high Indian cheek-bones."
"或许是由于他那暗绿色的皮肤，他看起来跟我之前看到的拿破仑的一座久远的半身青铜像非常相似。然而，他表情阴郁，那歪歪斜斜的羊毛呢帽和耳边蓬乱的头发也使他显得更加与众不同。","Perhaps the dusky greenish hue of his complexion, aided his resemblance to an old bronze bust I had seen of the Emperor.He had, however, a sullen, saturnine expression, set off by a slouched woollen hat, and elf locks that hung about his ears."
"这就是这个人的尊容，而他的行为举止也同样不招人喜欢。他表情冷冷的，说话言简意赅，不作任何承诺或声明，只是说明他及他的马所必需的服务条件。对此，我们感觉要求有些高，但是他却丝毫没有要降低要求的意思，也不急于跟我们确定雇佣关系。总之，在他的血液里有更多的红种人而不是白种人的成分。别人曾经提醒过我：所有的混血儿都不可信，他们是一个靠不住的、不忠诚的种族。所以如果能避免找皮埃尔·贝蒂给我们提供服务，我将会非常高兴。然而，我们没有时间再去找一个适合我们口味的人了，所以我们不得不当场跟他达成协议。然后，他便开始为这次的旅行做准备，还承诺在我们的晚间宿营地与我们会合。","Such was the appearance of the man, and his manners were equally unprepossessing.He was cold and laconic; made no promises or professions; stated the terms he required for the services of himself and his horse, which we thought rather high, but showed no disposition to abate them, nor any anxiety to secure our employ.He had altogether more of the red than the white man in his composition; and, as I had been taught to look upon all half-breeds with distrust, as an uncertain and faithless race, I would gladly have dispensed with the services of Pierre Beatte.We had no time, however, to look out for any one more to our taste, and had to make an arrangement with him on the spot.He then set about making his preparations for the journey, promising to join us at our evening’s encampment."
"要想准备好这次大草原之旅，我还需要一个东西——一匹能完全信得过的坐骑：我还没有找到一匹真正称心如意的坐骑。我之前买的那匹灰马虽然强壮、耐用，但却很粗暴。在最后一刻，我终于成功地得到了一匹出色的马：一匹深栗色、强壮有力、活泼好动、生机勃勃、状态极佳的马。我兴高采烈地骑上它，并把那匹银灰色的马交给托尼什。他为发现自己成为一个十足的骑手而兴奋不已，我则担心他也许会意识到那句古老而闻名的谚语“马背上的乞丐”的含义。","One thing was yet wanting to fit me out for the Prairies—a thoroughly trustworthy steed: I was not yet mounted to my mind.The gray I had bought, though strong and serviceable, was rough.At the last moment I succeeded in getting an excellent animal; a dark bay; powerful, active, generous-spirited, and in capital condition.I mounted him with exultation, and transferred the silver gray to Tonish, who was in such ecstasies at finding himself so completely en Cavalier, that I feared he might realize the ancient and well-known proverb of “a beggar on horseback.”"
"第四章 启程","CHAPTER IV. THE DEPARTURE."
"最终长长的号角声标志着要启程了。巡逻骑兵们排成一队，稀稀拉拉地穿越树林。我们也很快骑上马，跟在他们后边，但却被不听话的驮马给耽搁了。它们不习惯列队前进，所以尽管托尼什不停地咒骂、吆喝，它们还是在灌木丛里四处乱窜。托尼什骑着他那英勇的灰马，肩上扛着一枝长步枪，满脸焦虑地跟着它们，声嘶力竭地喊着、骂着。","The long-drawn notes of a bugle at length gave the signal for departure.The rangers filed off in a straggling line of march through the woods: we were soon on horseback and following on, but were detained by the irregularity of the pack-horses.They were unaccustomed to keep the line, and straggled from side to side among the thickets, in spite of all the pesting and bedeviling of Tonish; who, mounted on his gallant gray, with a long rifle on his shoulder, worried after them, bestowing a superabundance of dry blows and curses."
"所以，我们很快便看不见护卫队了，但还是在尽力跟随他们的踪迹。我们穿过高高的森林和纠缠不清的灌木丛，越过印第安人的棚屋和黑人的小屋，终于在将近日落时分到达了一个边疆农舍。这个农舍的主人是一个移民，名叫贝里希尔。农舍坐落在一个小山上，巡逻骑兵们也已在山脚下的一个环形小树林里的小溪旁安营扎寨了。房主很有礼貌地接待了我们，但是因为他家正流行着传染病，所以他无法给我们提供住处。他本人看上去状况也不太好，尽管他身材高大，但却面如菜色，说话颤颤巍巍，声调忽高忽低。","We soon, therefore, lost sight of our escort, but managed to keep on their track, thridding lofty forests, and entangled thickets, and passing by Indian wigwams and negro huts, until toward dusk we arrived at a frontier farm-house, owned by a settler of the name of Berryhill.It was situated on a hill, below which the rangers had encamped in a circular grove, on the margin of a stream.The master of the house received us civilly, but could offer us no accommodation, for sickness prevailed in his family.He appeared himself to be in no very thriving condition, for though bulky in frame, he had a sallow, unhealthy complexion, and a whiffling double voice, shifting abruptly from a treble to a thorough-bass."
"发现他的木屋几乎成了一个挤满病人的医院之后，我们便下令在农场的空地上安营扎寨。","Finding his log house was a mere hospital, crowded with invalids, we ordered our tent to be pitched in the farm-yard."
"我们的帐篷搭好没过多久，刚雇的随从——贝蒂，那个奥塞奇混血儿便出现了。他是骑着马来的，另外还牵着一匹马，牵的那匹马上似乎驮着为这次远征而精心准备的一些必需品。显然，只要看看他是如何照顾自己和他为紧急情况所做的准备，便可以知道贝蒂是一个“老战士”了。得知自己是被政府雇佣，为专员服务的，他便索取了政府配给的面粉和咸肉，然后把它们放好，以防止风雨。他除了有一匹粗野强壮、用于赶路和提供日常服务的马之外，还有一匹专门用于打猎的马。像他自己一样，这匹马也是一个混血儿，它是家养马和草原上的野马的杂交后代。这是一匹高贵的骏马，有着饱满的精神、矫健的身姿，还有漂亮的臀部。他在事务所时就已经小心翼翼地给它钉上蹄铁了。无论是为了上战场还是为了打猎，他都作好了万全的准备：肩上扛着来复枪，挎着牛角制成的火药筒和子弹袋，腰间别着猎刀，马鞍上放着绳圈——有人告诉我们那是套索，或者叫套马索，是用来捕捉野马的。","We had not been long encamped, when our recently engaged attendant, Beatte, the Osage half-breed, made his appearance.He came mounted on one horse and leading another, which seemed to be well packed with supplies for the expedition.Beatte was evidently an “old soldier,” as to the art of taking care of himself and looking out for emergencies.Finding that he was in government employ, being engaged by the Commissioner, he had drawn rations of flour and bacon, and put them up so as to be weather-proof.In addition to the horse for the road, and for ordinary service, which was a rough, hardy animal, he had another for hunting.This was of a mixed breed like himself, being a cross of the domestic stock with the wild horse of the prairies; and a noble steed it was, of generous spirit, fine action, and admirable bottom.He had taken care to have his horses well shod at the Agency.He came prepared at all points for war or hunting: his rifle on his shoulder, his powder-horn and bullet-pouch at his side, his hunting-knife stuck in his belt, and coils of cordage at his saddle bow, which we were told were lariats, or noosed cords, used in catching the wild horse."
"这样的装备使得大草原上的一个印第安猎手和大海上的一艘巡洋舰并无二致——完全独立于世界之外，能够自我保护，自给自足。他能够使自己不依附任何人，自己决定自己的行为方式，自己照顾好自己的财务。我认为贝蒂好像自我感觉很独立而且高人一等，因为我们正行进在这片旷野之中。他一直是一副志得意满与阴沉郁闷参半的样子，仍旧是沉默寡言。他最关心的就是把东西从马背上卸下来并把马儿们牵到一个安全的地方过夜。他一切的行为举止和我们那位夸夸其谈、喋喋不休、手忙脚乱的小法国人形成了最鲜明的对比。后者也似乎对这位新来的人有些嫉妒。他悄悄告诉我们说，这些混血儿脾气暴躁、反复无常，一点儿都靠不住。那个贝蒂很明显打算只关心自己，在我们行进的过程中，他随时都有可能因为突然觉得厌烦或者受到冒犯，在紧急关头弃我们于不顾：他自己有着各种应变的技巧，能在大草原上游刃有余。","Thus equipped and provided, an Indian hunter on a prairie is like a cruiser on the ocean, perfectly independent of the world, and competent to self-protection and self-maintenance.He can cast himself loose from every one, shape his own course, and take care of his own fortunes.I thought Beatte seemed to feel his independence, and to consider himself superior to us all, now that we were launching into the wilderness.He maintained a half proud, half sullen look, and great taciturnity, and his first care was to unpack his horses and put them in safe quarters for the night.His whole demeanor was in perfect contrast to our vaporing, chattering, bustling little Frenchman.The latter, too, seemed jealous of this new-comer.He whispered to us that these half-breeds were a touchy, capricious people, little to be depended upon.That Beatte had evidently come prepared to take care of himself, and that, at any moment in the course of our tour, he would be liable to take some sudden disgust or affront, and abandon us at a moment’s warning: having the means of shifting for himself, and being perfectly at home on the prairies."
"第五章 边塞风情","CHAPTER V. FRONTIER SCENES."
"——边境上的莱克格斯——林奇的律法——找马遇险——年轻的奥塞奇人","—A LYCURGUS OF THE BORDER.—LYNCH’S LAW.—THE DANGER OF FINDING A HORSE.—THE YOUNG OSAGE."
"第二天早上（10月11日），我们七点半就动身了。我们骑马穿过厚厚的、肥沃的冲积土地。这片土地上杂草丛生、树木成林。我们的行进路线和阿肯色河的西岸平行，希望可以在阿肯色河与雷德福克河的合流点附近赶上巡逻骑兵的大部队。一些克里克人的村庄和农舍零星分布在方圆几英里的土地上。那里的居民看起来已经运用了很多便利条件，初步进入了文明社会，从而繁荣兴旺起来。他们的农场都储备丰富，他们的家看起来舒适而富有。","On the following morning (October 11), we were on the march by half-past seven o’clock, and rode through deep rich bottoms of alluvial soil, overgrown with redundant vegetation, and trees of an enormous size.Our route lay parallel to the west bank of the Arkansas, on the borders of which river, near the confluence of the Red Fork, we expected to overtake the main body of rangers.For some miles the country was sprinkled with Creek villages and farm-houses; the inhabitants of which appeared to have adopted, with considerable facility, the rudiments of civilization, and to have thriven in consequence.Their farms were well stocked, and their houses had a look of comfort and abundance."
"我们碰到了一些人，他们刚刚参加完一场盛大的球类比赛回来，他们的民族因这种球类比赛而闻名于世。他们中有的步行，有的骑在马背上，通常，骑马的人的后面会坐着一个衣着华丽的女人。他们是个体形匀称的种族，肌肉强健而结实，腿优美而颀长。他们像吉普赛人一样，非常喜欢鲜艳的颜色及华美的装饰。从大草原上远远望去，那些醒目而奇特的目标便是他们。一个人的头上围着一条鲜红色的手帕，头顶上戴着一束像鸡尾一样的黑色羽毛。另一个人则头围一条白色的手帕，头顶一束红色的羽毛；还有一个人，也想头顶一束羽毛，但却因为没有羽毛，于是在头巾里插上了一束鲜艳的漆树枝。","We met with numbers of them returning from one of their grand games of ball, for which their nation is celebrated.Some were on foot, some on horseback; the latter, occasionally, with gaily-dressed females behind them.They are a well-made race, muscular and closely knit, with well-turned thighs and legs.They have a gypsy fondness for brilliant colors and gay decorations, and are bright and fanciful objects when seen at a distance on the prairies.One had a scarlet handkerchief bound round his head, surmounted with a tuft of black feathers like a cocktail.Another had a white handkerchief, with red feathers; while a third, for want of a plume, had stuck in his turban a brilliant bunch of sumach."
"在荒野的边缘，我们在一个木屋前停下来问路。这个木屋的主人是一个白人移民，或者叫做无主土地上的合法定居者。他是一个骨瘦如柴的高个儿老头，红头发，细长的脸上双颊深陷，一只眼睛长年习惯性地眨着，就好像他说的一切都有心照不宣的含意。他目前正情绪高涨。他的一匹马丢失了，他确定是被先前驻扎在泥沼旁的零零散散的奥塞奇人在夜间偷走的。但既然他没有丢掉其他东西，也应该知足了。他要给这帮恶棍一个教训。因此，他摘下墙上的来复枪——这可是边境上永恒不变的对与错的强制实施者，给马装上马鞍，打算向沼泽地发起突袭。他的一个同伴手里正拿着来复枪站在那里，准备陪他一起去。","On the verge of the wilderness we paused to inquire our way at a log house, owned by a white settler or squatter, a tall raw-boned old fellow, with red hair, a lank lantern visage, and an inveterate habit of winking with one eye, as if everything he said was of knowing import.He was in a towering passion.One of his horses was missing; he was sure it had been stolen in the night by a straggling party of Osages encamped in a neighboring swamp; but he would have satisfaction!He would make an example of the villains.He had accordingly caught down his rifle from the wall, that invariable enforcer of right or wrong upon the frontiers, and, having saddled his steed, was about to sally forth on a foray into the swamp; while a brother squatter, with rifle in hand, stood ready to accompany him."
"我们尽力使这个草原上的老征人冷静下来，说他的马也许在邻近的森林里迷路了。但是他却有着边境上的人共有的倾向——把一切罪责归咎于印第安人，所以也就没有什么能阻止他带着武器冲入沼泽地了。","We endeavored to calm the old campaigner of the prairies, by suggesting that his horse might have strayed into the neighboring woods; but he had the frontier propensity to charge everything to the Indians, and nothing could dissuade him from carrying fire and sword into the swamp."
"又骑了几英里之后，我们不但失去了巡逻骑兵大部队的踪迹，还被印第安人和移民们留下的各种各样的足迹搞得晕头转向。最后，我们来到了一个木屋前，屋里住着一位白人，这应该是边境上最偏远的一个屋子了。我们发现我们已经偏离了正确的方向。他带我们往回走了一段路，把我们领到了正确的路上。我们沿着这路，终于开始了征程，向着那无边的荒原挺进。","After riding a few miles farther we lost the trail of the main body of rangers, and became perplexed by a variety of tracks made lay the Indians and settlers.At length coming to a log house, inhabited by a white man, the very last on the frontier, we found that we had wandered from our true course.Taking us back for some distance, he again brought us to the right trail; putting ourselves upon which, we took our final departure, and launched into the broad wilderness."
"大部队的踪迹就像一条漫无尽头的小路，翻过小山和低谷，越过灌木和荆棘，又延伸至纠缠不清的树丛和开阔的大草原。当一队人穿越荒原时，按照惯例，应像印第安人那样，人和马都挨个儿排成一列。这样，领头的人便会为后面的人开路以节省他们的体力，保持精神。同时，采用这种方式就使得别人无法得知这支队的人数，因为整支队伍只留下了一条窄窄的、踏得平平的小径标明他们前进的方向。","The trail kept on like a straggling footpath, over hill and dale, through brush and brake, and tangled thicket, and open prairie.In traversing the wilds it is customary for a party either of horse or foot to follow each other in single file like the Indians; so that the leaders break the way for those who follow, and lessen their labor and fatigue.In this way, also, the number of a party is concealed, the whole leaving but one narrow well-trampled track to mark their course."
"不久，我们又重新找到了大部队的踪迹。就在这时，我们见到了那位枯瘦如柴、拼命眨眼、策马狂奔的边境骑侠。他正从树林里钻出来，奔下小山坡，他那全副武装的同伴跟在后面。随着他渐渐向我们靠近，他那憔悴而沮丧的面容使我想起了对堂吉诃德的描述，他也同样为英勇的事业而全力以赴，准备穿越敌人藏身的、危险沼泽地里的丛林。","We had not long regained the trail, when, on emerging from a forest, we beheld our raw-boned, hard-winking, hard-riding knight-errant of the frontier, descending the slope of a hill, followed by his companion in arms.As he drew near to us, the gauntness of his figure and ruefulness of his aspect reminded me of the description of the hero of La Mancha, and he was equally bent on affairs of doughty enterprise, being about to penetrate the thickets of the perilous swamp, within which the enemy lay ensconced."
"我们正在山坡上和他说话，突然看到大约半英里之外有一个奥塞奇人骑着马从一片树林里冒出来，手里还用缰绳牵着另一匹马。我们那拼命眨眼的朋友马上意识到，那人牵着的那匹马正是他在寻找的马。这个奥塞奇人渐渐向我们靠近，他的外貌给我留下了深刻的印象。他大概也就十九或二十岁，但却发育得很好。他有着他部落人所共有的罗马人般的俊美长相。他骑在马上，腰间围着毯子，他那赤裸的上半身简直可以作为雕像的模特。他骑着一匹漂亮的白棕杂色马，是大草原上的野马。马脖子上套着一个宽宽的轭，轭的前面挂着一束被染成鲜红色的马鬃。","While we were holding a parley with him on the slope of the hill, we descried an Osage on horseback issuing out of a skirt of wood about half a mile off, and leading a horse by a halter.The latter was immediately recognized by our hard-winking friend as the steed of which he was in quest.As the Osage drew near, I was struck with his appearance.He was about nineteen or twenty years of age, but well grown, with the fine Roman countenance common to his tribe, and as he rode with his blanket wrapped round his loins, his naked bust would have furnished a model for a statuary.He was mounted on beautiful piebald horse, a mottled white and brown, of the wild breed of the prairies, decorated with a broad collar, from which hung in front a tuft of horsehair dyed of a bright scarlet."
"这个年轻人坦然地向我们慢慢地骑了过来。通过翻译贝蒂，他告诉我们，他牵的那匹马误闯进了他们的营地，他现在正带着它回到主人那里去。","The youth rode slowly up to us with a frank open air, and signified by means of our interpreter Beatte, that the horse he was leading had wandered to their camp, and he was now on his way to conduct him back to his owner."
"我本来期望那位相貌难看的骑士会万分感谢，可出乎意料的是，这个老家伙竟勃然大怒。他声称是那些印第安人在晚上牵走了他的马，打算早上给他送回来，并因找到它而索要报酬。他确定这是印第安人惯用的伎俩。因此，他想把这个年轻的印第安人绑在树上猛抽一顿；而让他感到惊讶的是，对此我们采取了一种新奇的方式：我们十分愤慨地给了这个印第安人应有的报酬，让他跟着我们走。然而，这就是边境上通常采用的管理条例，用术语来说叫“林奇的律法”。根据这个律法，原告往往又是证人、陪审团、法官和执行人；而仅仅根据假设，被告就要被定罪并接受惩罚。我确信正是因为这个原因，印第安人中间才会积蓄那么多不满和怨恨，并导致了报复行为，最终引发与印第安人的战争。当我将这个光明磊落、长相高贵、举止直爽的年轻奥塞奇人与那个满脸险恶、行事专横的边境居民相比较时，对于谁更应该挨这一顿鞭子，我丝毫没有感到疑惑。","I had expected to witness an expression of gratitude on the part of our hard-favored cavalier, but to my surprise the old fellow broke out into a furious passion.He declared that the Indians had carried off his horse in the night, with the intention of bringing him home in the morning, and claiming a reward for finding him; a common practice, as he affirmed, among the Indians.He was, therefore, for tying the young Indian to a tree and giving him a sound lashing; and was quite surprised at the burst of indignation which this novel mode of requiting a service drew from us.Such, however, is too often the administration of law on the frontier, “Lynch’s law,” as it is technically termed, in which the plaintiff is apt to be witness, jury, judge, and executioner, and the defendant to be convicted and punished on mere presumption; and in this way, I am convinced, are occasioned many of those heart-burnings and resentments among the Indians, which lead to retaliation, and end in Indian wars.When I compared the open, noble countenance and frank demeanor of the young Osage, with the sinister visage and high-handed conduct of the frontiersman, I felt little doubt on whose back a lash would be most meritoriously bestowed."
"因此这个边境居民就只得满足于马的失而复得，而不能根据边境上古老的莱克格斯契约，或者更准确说是德拉古法享受鞭打帮他找到马的人的乐趣了。在同伴的跟随下，他抱怨着踏上了返乡的征程。","Being thus obliged to content himself with the recovery of his horse, without the pleasure of flogging the finder, into the bargain the old Lycurgus, or rather Draco, of the frontier, set off growling on his return homeward, followed by his brother squatter."
"至于那个年轻的奥塞奇人，我们都对他有先入为主的好感；尤其是年轻的伯爵，他这个年龄及他特有的个性是很自然地就会生出同情心来的，所以伯爵非常地喜欢他。尽管非常不合适，但他一定要那个年轻的奥塞奇人在他进入荒野探险时，做他的同伴和侍从。年轻人是很容易被打动的，而且伯爵告诉他，他可以在野牛出没的大草原上安全地狩猎，还能得到一条新毯子，他便调转缰绳，离开了沼泽地和他身后朋友们的宿营地，跟随着伯爵开始了寻找奥塞奇猎手的游荡之旅。","As for the youthful Osage, we were all prepossessed in his favor; the young Count especially, with the sympathies proper to his age and incident to his character, had taken quite a fancy to him.Nothing would suit but he must have the young Osage as a companion and squire in his expedition into the wilderness.The youth was easily tempted, and, with the prospect of a safe range over the buffalo prairies and the promise of a new blanket, he turned his bridle, left the swamp and the encampment of his friends behind him, and set off to follow the Count in his wanderings in quest of the Osage hunters."
"这就是在原始国度里人所具有的辉煌独立性。这个年轻人，带着他的来复枪、毯子及马，没有任何预兆地就准备去闯荡世界了。他随身带着自己在世间的所有财物，没有任何浮华的需求，还拥有着个人自由的伟大奥秘。我们这些文明人是奴隶，既是别人的奴隶，更是自己的奴隶；我们的奢侈品就是捆绑我们的枷锁，它阻碍着我们身体的每一个行动，阻止着我们灵魂的每一次冲动。至少这是我当时的想法。虽然我不确定，但是年轻伯爵的满腔热忱告诉我们，他好像比以前更加沉醉于大草原上狂野的骑士精神，他高谈阔论着和奥塞奇人一起时，他可以穿上印第安人的服装并按印第安人的习俗生活。","Such is the glorious independence of man in a savage state.This youth, with his rifle, his blanket, and his horse, was ready at a moment’s warning to rove the world; he carried all his worldly effects with him, and in the absence of artificial wants, possessed the great secret of personal freedom.We of society are slaves, not so much to others as to ourselves; our superfluities are the chains that bind us, impeding every movement of our bodies and thwarting every impulse of our souls.Such, at least, were my speculations at the time, though I am not sure but that they took their tone from the enthusiasm of the young Count, who seemed more enchanted than ever with the wild chivalry of the prairies, and talked of putting on the Indian dress and adopting the Indian habits during the time he hoped to pass with the Osages."

"——伯爵及其人马的离开——一个被遗弃的战营——一只流浪狗——营地","—DEPARTURE OF THE COUNT AND HIS PARTY.—A DESERTED WAR CAMP.—A VAGRANT DOG.—THE ENCAMPMENT."
"在早上追寻大部队踪迹的过程中，我们发现它与另一条踪迹相交叉，这条踪迹穿过树林朝西，径直向阿肯色河方向延伸。混血儿贝蒂在琢磨了一会儿后宣布，这是奥塞奇猎手的足迹，并且一定是通向他们在去狩猎的途中要涉水过河的地方。","In the course of the morning the trail we were pursuing was crossed by another, which struck off through the forest to the west in a direct course for the Arkansas River.Beatte, our half-breed, after considering it for a moment, pronounced it the trail of the Osage hunters; and that it must lead to the place where they had forded the river on their way to the hunting grounds."
"这时，年轻的伯爵和他的同伴停了下来，准备离开我们。队伍当中那些最有经验的边疆居民警告他们：这么做是很危险的。他们将会把自己暴露在荒野中；除了一个年轻无知的混血儿和一个更加年轻的印第安人之外，他们没有任何其他的向导、护卫或随从。他们将要和一匹驮马、两匹向导马一起穿过茂密的森林，越过河流和沼泽，而这些只会为他们带来不便。由于奥塞奇人和波尼族人正在打仗，他们可能落入凶残的敌人波尼族武士手中。另外，他们那么少的人和那么值钱的马，将会对那些游荡在边境上的奥塞奇落队人员构成很大的诱惑。这些奥塞奇人很可能会在晚上抢了他们的马，使他们一无所有地在大草原中徒步前行。","Here then the young Count and his companion came to a halt and prepared to take leave of us.The most experienced frontiersmen in the troop remonstrated on the hazard of the undertaking.They were about to throw themselves loose in the wilderness, with no other guides, guards, or attendants, than a young ignorant half-breed, and a still younger Indian.They were embarrassed by a pack-horse and two led horses, with which they would have to make their way through matted forests, and across rivers and morasses.The Osages and Pawnees were at war, and they might fall in with some warrior party of the latter, who are ferocious foes; besides, their small number, and their valuable horses, would form a great temptation to some of the straggling bands of Osages loitering about the frontier, who might rob them of their horses in the night, and leave them destitute and on foot in the midst of the prairies."
"然而，没有什么能抑制住伯爵要与奥塞奇人一起围猎野牛的浪漫狂热。他有一种游戏精神，似乎总是一想到危险便激动不已。他的同伴到了行事更加谨慎的年龄，个性也更加冷静，他确信这次行动很莽撞，但却不能左右他这位年轻朋友那一时的冲动，而且他又如此忠诚，是不会让他独自去冒险的。因此，我们非常遗憾地看着他们脱离护卫队的保护，踏上他们率性而为的征程。我们队伍中的老猎手们都不住地摇着头，混血儿贝蒂预测着他们会遇到的各种困难。我唯一的希望是：他们将很快就遇到足够多的困惑，以使年轻伯爵冷静下来，并促使他重新加入我们。我们带着这种想法缓慢前进着，中午停留了相当长的一段时间。重新开始征程后，阿肯色河进入了我们的视野。它是一条河面宽阔、水流湍急的河流，边上是沙质细美、长满杨柳和棉白杨的沙滩。越过这条河流，我们的目光便流连在一片美丽的原野上。那里有鲜花盛开的平原，有起伏的山地，其间点缀着一片片的小树林和树丛，还有狭长的森林。整体看上去就像是一片完整的、甚至是精心规划过的耕作地，而不是一片自由生长的原野。河的不远处，在一片空旷的高地上，我们经过了一处刚刚被奥塞奇士兵遗弃的营地。帐篷或者是棚屋的框架还残留着，弯成拱形的杆子两头都插入地面：这些杆子是由粗粗细细的树枝缠绕而成的，上面裹着树皮和兽皮。那些熟知印第安人习性的人，能够凭借棚屋的形状和位置来确定这是哪个部落，以及他们是在狩猎还是在进行战略性远征。贝蒂指给我们看，在营地框架中，哪儿是酋长们围着火堆开会的棚屋，哪儿是被仔细踏平并举行过盛大战斗舞蹈的空地。","Nothing, however, could restrain the romantic ardor of the Count for a campaign of buffalo hunting with the Osages, and he had a game spirit that seemed always stimulated by the idea of danger.His travelling companion, of discreeter age and calmer temperament, was convinced of the rashness of the enterprise; but he could not control the impetuous zeal of his youthful friend, and he was too loyal to leave him to pursue his hazardous scheme alone.To our great regret, therefore, we saw them abandon the protection of our escort, and strike off on their hap-hazard expedition.The old hunters of our party shook their heads, and our half-breed, Beatte, predicted all kinds of trouble to them; my only hope was, that they would soon meet with perplexities enough to cool the impetuosity of the young Count, and induce him to rejoin us.With this idea we travelled slowly, and made a considerable halt at noon.After resuming our march, we came in sight of the Arkansas.It presented a broad and rapid stream, bordered by a beach of fine sand, overgrown with willows and cottonwood-trees.Beyond the river, the eye wandered over a beautiful champaign country, of flowery plains and sloping uplands, diversified by groves and clumps of trees, and long screens of woodland; the whole wearing the aspect of complete, and even ornamental cultivation, instead of native wilfulness.Not far from the river, on an open eminence, we passed through the recently deserted camping place of an Osage war party.The frames of the tents or wigwams remained, consisting of poles bent into an arch, with each end stuck into the ground: these are intertwined with twigs and branches, and covered with bark and skins.Those experienced in Indian lore, can ascertain the tribe, and whether on a hunting or a warlike expedition, by the shape and disposition of the wigwams.Beatte pointed out to us, in the present skeleton camp, the wigwam in which the chiefs had held their consultations around the council-fire; and an open area, well trampled down, on which the grand war-dance had been performed."
"我们的旅程继续着。穿过一个树林时，我们碰到了一只孤苦伶仃、饿得半死的狗。它双眼红肿，神情迷茫地沿着足迹徘徊着。虽然差一点儿就被走在最前面的骑兵踩到，但谁也没能引起它的注意，它依旧在马匹之间随意穿梭着。人们很快就大叫它是“疯狗”，一个骑兵还端起了步枪，但被一贯仁慈的专员阻止了。“它眼睛瞎了！”他说，“它是某个贫穷的印第安人的狗，正在通过气味来追寻它的主人。杀害一个如此忠诚的动物是可耻的。”那个骑兵便扛上了来复枪。狗则踉踉跄跄、毫发无伤地穿过了行进的队伍。它的鼻子一直贴在地上，沿着足迹继续着它的旅程，为我们提供了一个狗对主人忠诚的罕见例子。","Pursuing our journey, as we were passing through a forest, we were met by a forlorn, half-famished dog, who came rambling along the trail, with inflamed eyes, and bewildered look.Though nearly trampled upon by the foremost rangers, he took notice of no one, but rambled heedlessly among the horses.The cry of “mad dog” was immediately raised, and one of the rangers levelled his rifle, but was stayed by the ever-ready humanity of the Commissioner.“He is blind!” said he.“It is the dog of some poor Indian, following his master by the scent.It would be a shame to kill so faithful an animal.”The ranger shouldered his rifle, the dog blundered blindly through the cavalcade unhurt, and keeping his nose to the ground, continued his course along the trail, affording a rare instance of a dog surviving a bad name."
"大约三点钟时，我们来到了骑兵队最近刚刚离开的营地：一个火堆的木头还在冒烟。根据贝蒂的看法，他们离开还不超过一天。由于旁边有很好的水源和大量马吃的豌豆藤，所以我们当夜就在这儿安营扎寨了。","About three o’clock, we came to a recent camping-place of the company of rangers: the brands of one of their fires were still smoking; so that, according to the opinion of Beatte, they could not have passed on above a day previously.As there was a fine stream of water close by, and plenty of pea-vines for the horses, we encamped here for the night."
"我们在这里呆了一会儿，便听到远处传来了招呼声，然后就看到年轻的伯爵和他的人马穿过森林向我们这边靠近。我们带着满心的欢喜迎接他们进入帐篷，因为他们当初离开我们去冒险使我们非常不安。一次短暂的实验使他们确信，像他们这种没有经验、带着这么些马和这么少随从的旅行者，穿越荒原是既艰辛而又困难的。幸运的是，他们决定在天黑前重新加入我们。在野外露宿一夜就很有可能使他们失去马匹。伯爵已经成功地说服他提挈的骑士随从——那个年轻的奥塞奇人——继续跟着他，还计划在他的帮助下，在大草原上野牛围猎时获得大量的战利品。","We had not been here long, when we heard a halloo from a distance, and beheld the young Count and his party advancing through the forest.We welcomed them to the camp with heartfelt satisfaction; for their departure upon so hazardous an expedition had caused us great uneasiness.A short experiment had convinced them of the toil and difficulty of inexperienced travellers like themselves making their way through the wilderness with such a train of horses, and such slender attendance.Fortunately, they determined to rejoin us before night-fall; one night’s camping out might have cost them their horses.The Count had prevailed upon his protege and esquire, the young Osage, to continue with him, and still calculated upon achieving great exploits, with his assistance, on the buffalo prairies."
"第七章 巡逻骑兵的消息","CHAPTER VII. NEWS OF THE RANGERS."
"——伯爵和他的印第安随从——树林中的短暂停留——林中的美景——奥塞奇村庄——我们晚间营地的奥塞奇造访者","—THE COUNT AND HIS INDIAN SQUIRE.—HALT IN THE WOODS.—WOODLAND SCENE.—OSAGE VILLAGE.—OSAGE VISITORS AT OUR EVENING CAMP."
"清晨（10月12日），先前被吉布森要塞的指挥官派出去传达快讯、阻止巡逻骑兵队继续前行的那两个克里克人，在回程途中到达了我们的营地。他们已经让那队人马在大约五十英里以外的地方安营扎寨，等待我们的到达。那是阿肯色境内的一个好地方，猎物充足。这条消息使得我们整队人马都充满了生气。日出时分，我们精神焕发，开始了旅程。","In the morning early (October 12th), the two Creeks who had been sent express by the commander of Fort Gibson, to stop the company of rangers, arrived at our encampment on their return.They had left the company encamped about fifty miles distant, in a fine place on the Arkansas, abounding in game, where they intended to await our arrival.This news spread animation throughout our party, and we set out on our march at sunrise, with renewed spirit."
"在骑上马时，年轻的奥塞奇人试图往他的野马背上扔一块毛毯。这匹敏感的良驹受到了惊吓，抬起前蹄往后退了去。这匹野马和这个几乎全裸的野蛮人的姿势，很值得画家或雕刻家好好研究研究。","In mounting our steeds, the young Osage attempted to throw a blanket upon his wild horse.The fine, sensible animal took fright, reared and recoiled.The attitudes of the wild horse and the almost naked savage, would have formed studies for a painter or a statuary."
"行进过程中，一路上看着年轻的伯爵和他新加入的追随者在我前面骑着马，我常常为此而感到高兴。没有比勇敢的骑士配乡绅更合适的了。伯爵的马术精湛，并且正如我之前所注意到的那样，他是一个大胆而高雅的骑手。他也非常喜欢让他的马作半旋转式跳跃及意气风发地飞驰。他的衣服是一套艳丽的印第安鹿皮猎装，裁剪合适，染成了漂亮的紫色，上面绣着精美的各色丝绸，仿佛是某个印第安美女为装扮她心爱的酋长而完成的杰作。为了搭配好衣服，他穿上了皮制马裤和鹿皮靴，戴上了一顶军便帽，斜背着一杆上面挂有子弹带的双管枪。这样一来，当他优雅地骑上那匹精力充沛的坐骑时，他便俊美如画了。","I often pleased myself in the course of our march, with noticing the appearance of the young Count and his newly enlisted follower, as they rode before me.Never was preux chevalier better suited with an esquire.The Count was well mounted, and, as I have before observed, was a bold and graceful rider.He was fond, too, of caracoling his horse, and dashing about in the buoyancy of youthful spirits.His dress was a gay Indian hunting frock of dressed deer skin, setting well to the shape, dyed of a beautiful purple, and fancifully embroidered with silks of various colors; as if it had been the work of some Indian beauty, to decorate a favorite chief.With this he wore leathern pantaloons and moccasons, a foraging cap, and a double-barrelled gun slung by a bandoleer athwart his back: so that he was quite a picturesque figure as he managed gracefully his spirited steed."
"那个年轻的奥塞奇人总是骑着他那匹粗野但很好看的杂色马紧随其后。这匹马身上还有几簇漂亮的深红色鬃毛。他光着英俊的头和健美的上身骑在马背上；毛毯围在腰间。他一手拿着他的来复枪，另一只手驾着马，似乎时刻准备只要警报一响，他就和他的年轻领袖一起冲出去，疯狂地袭击敌人或策马狂奔。伯爵怀着年轻人乐观的期待，计划着我们到波尼人猎场里的野牛群中后，他将在他年轻“勇士”的陪伴下进行许多刺激的探险，收获大量猎物。","The young Osage would ride close behind him on his wild and beautifully mottled horse, which was decorated with crimson tufts of hair.He rode with his finely shaped head and bust naked; his blanket being girt round his waist.He carried his rifle in one hand, and managed his horse with the other, and seemed ready to dash off at a moment’s warning, with his youthful leader, on any madcap foray or scamper.The Count, with the sanguine anticipations of youth, promised himself many hardy adventures and exploits in company with his youthful “brave,” when we should get among the buffaloes, in the Pawnee hunting grounds."
"骑了一段路后，我们穿过了一条狭窄但很深的溪流，溪流上横跨着一座结实的桥。这座桥是年代久远的海狸坝上的遗存。那群辛勤地建造了这堤坝的海狸们已经被猎杀光了。头顶上，一队野鹅高高地在空中飞过，它们喧闹地啼叫着，提醒我们一年又要过去了。","After riding some distance, we crossed a narrow, deep stream, upon a solid bridge, the remains of an old beaver dam; the industrious community which had constructed it had all been destroyed.Above us, a streaming flight of wild geese, high in the air, and making a vociferous noise, gave note of the waning year."
"大约十点半时，我们在一个长有大量豌豆藤的树林里进行了短暂的停留。在这儿，我们松开缰绳让马吃食。我们生起了一堆火，并从一个邻近的泉眼打了水。不一会儿，法国人小托尼什就给我们准备好了一壶提神用的咖啡。大家正一同分享咖啡的时候，一个老奥塞奇人加入了我们。他是刚刚经过这条路的一小支狩猎队中的一员。他正在寻找他那迷路或者是被偷走的马。当混血儿贝蒂听说奥塞奇猎手们也在这个方向上时，他扮了个苦笑的鬼脸。“在我们超过那些猎手之前，”他说，“我们将不会看到野牛。他们就像草原上的烈火一样，把所有的东西都吓跑。”","About half past ten o’clock we made a halt in a forest, where there was abundance of the pea-vine.Here we turned the horses loose to graze.A fire was made, water procured from an adjacent spring, and in a short time our little Frenchman, Tonish, had a pot of coffee prepared for our refreshment.While partaking of it, we were joined by an old Osage, one of a small hunting party who had recently passed this way.He was in search of his horse, which had wandered away, or been stolen.Our half-breed, Beatte, made a wry face on hearing of Osage hunters in this direction.“Until we pass those hunters,” said he, “we shall see no buffaloes.They frighten away every thing, like a prairie on fire.”"
"早饭结束后，人们用各种各样的方式消遣着。有些人在用他们的来复枪瞄靶射击；有些人头枕着马鞍，身子半埋在厚厚的落叶中睡觉；还有些人围在树下的火堆旁聊天，树枝间不断冒出一圈圈蓝色的烟。马儿们纵情享用着豌豆藤，有的还躺下来在豌豆藤中间打滚。","The morning repast being over, the party amused themselves in various ways.Some shot with their rifles at a mark, others lay asleep half buried in the deep bed of foliage, with their heads resting on their saddles; others gossiped round the fire at the foot of a tree, which sent up wreaths of blue smoke among the branches.The horses banqueted luxuriously on the pea-vines, and some lay down and rolled amongst them."
"我们处在高大树木的树阴里。它们拥有笔直光滑的树干，像坚实的柱子一样。偶尔有阳光穿过透明的叶子，给多彩的秋天再微微染上一笔，这使我想起了阳光闪烁在哥特式大教堂的彩色玻璃和一根根柱子之间时所产生的效果。不错，我们宽广的西部森林有一种庄严隆重之感，这唤起了我之前曾在那些令人崇敬的大型建筑物里所经历过的相同的感受。风呼呼地掠过林间，不时地给深呼吸提供新鲜空气。","We were overshadowed by lofty trees, with straight, smooth trunks, like stately columns; and as the glancing rays of the sun shone through the transparent leaves, tinted with the many-colored hues of autumn, I was reminded of the effect of sunshine among the stained windows and clustering columns of a Gothic cathedral.Indeed there is a grandeur and solemnity in our spacious forests of the West, that awaken in me the same feeling I have experienced in those vast and venerable piles, and the sound of the wind sweeping through them, supplies occasionally the deep breathings of the organ."
"大约中午时，号角将马儿们聚集了起来，我们再一次踏上征程，希望在天黑前到达巡逻骑兵的宿营地。老奥塞奇人向我们保证，我们离那儿不会超过十或十二英里远。当我们穿过一个森林时，经过了一个孤零零的池塘，那上面覆盖着我所见过的最美丽的睡莲，还有几只林鸳鸯在其中游弋。林鸳鸯是水禽中最漂亮的一种,因其优雅和绚丽的羽毛而著称。","About noon the bugle sounded to horse, and we were again on the march, hoping to arrive at the encampment of the rangers before night; as the old Osage had assured us it was not above ten or twelve miles distant.In our course through a forest, we passed by a lonely pool, covered with the most magnificent water-lilies I had ever beheld; among which swam several wood-ducks, one of the most beautiful of water-fowl, remarkable for the gracefulness and brilliancy of its plumage."
"又往前走了一段距离之后，我们来到了阿肯色河的岸边。这儿有大量的马蹄印延伸到水中，表明一队奥塞奇猎手近期刚穿过这条河，前往野牛出没的猎场。让马儿在这条河里喝足水之后，我们继续沿着河岸前进，想找一块空地，接着穿过草原。在草原上，当看到远处的烟时，我们都希望这烟是从巡逻骑兵的帐篷里飘出来的。沿着我们猜测应该是属于他们的足迹，我们来到了一片草地。在那儿，一些马正在吃草，然而它们却不是军队的马。又往前走了一段路之后，我们到达了一个位于阿肯色河河岸上的零散的奥塞奇村落。我们的到来产生了不小的轰动。一些老人走上前来，与我们分别握手，而女人和孩子则挤作一团，一边放肆地盯着我们，一边互相说笑。我们发现村庄里的所有年轻人都离开狩猎去了，只留下妇女、孩子和老人。在这里，专员骑在马背上做了一场演说，告诉他的听众他这次任务的主要目的是促进西部各部落间的共同和平，敦促他们放弃所有尚武和嗜杀的观念，不要肆意向波尼人发动进攻。这场由贝蒂来做翻译的演说，似乎对大多数人有很好的安抚作用。他们信誓旦旦地承诺，在他们的有生之年将不会打破和平。其实，他们的年龄和性别让我们有理由相信他们会信守诺言。","After proceeding some distance farther, we came down upon the banks of the Arkansas, at a place where tracks of numerous horses, all entering the water, showed where a party of Osage hunters had recently crossed the river on their way to the buffalo range.After letting our horses drink in the river, we continued along its bank for a space, and then across prairies, where we saw a distant smoke, which we hoped might proceed from the encampment of the rangers.Following what we supposed to be their trail, we came to a meadow in which were a number of horses grazing: they were not, however, the horses of the troop.A little farther on, we reached a straggling Osage village, on the banks of the Arkansas.Our arrival created quite a sensation.A number of old men came forward and shook hands with us all severally; while the women and children huddled together in groups, staring at us wildly, chattering and laughing among themselves.We found that all the young men of the village had departed on a hunting expedition, leaving the women and children and old men behind.Here the Commissioner made a speech from on horseback; informing his hearers of the purport of his mission, to promote a general peace among the tribes of the West, and urging them to lay aside all warlike and bloodthirsty notions, and not to make any wanton attacks upon the Pawnees.This speech being interpreted by Beatte, seemed to have a most pacifying effect upon the multitude, who promised faithfully that, as far as in them lay, the peace should not be disturbed; and indeed their age and sex gave some reason to trust that they would keep their word."
"因为我们还是希望可以在天黑前到达巡逻骑兵的营地，所以我们不停地赶路，直到黄昏时我们才不得不在溪谷边上停下来。巡逻骑兵们在溪谷尽头的树下露营，我们则在湍急的溪流旁满是岩石的小山上搭起了帐篷。天色慢慢变黑了，乌云在空中翻滚，似乎要下雨了。巡逻骑兵们的篝火在溪谷中烧得正旺，照亮了那些围着火堆做饭、吃饭、喝酒的人们，他们的长相如强盗一般。几个我们经过的村庄里来的奥塞奇印第安访客混杂其中，增添了整个场景的野性之美。他们中的三个人走过了来，在我们的篝火旁坐下。他们看起来像铜质纪念雕像般沉默地观察着周围所发生的一切。我们给了他们食物和他们最喜欢的咖啡。所有的印第安人都很喜欢这种在西部风行的饮料。做好晚饭之后，他们在篝火前肩并肩地舒展开身体，然后开始用鼻子哼起了圣歌，用手敲打着胸膛作为伴奏的鼓点。他们的圣歌好像是由一句句齐整的诗句组成，没有悦耳的调子，而是以突兀的感叹词“哼”结尾，听起来就像打嗝。翻译贝蒂告诉我们,这首圣歌与我们有关：我们的长相、对待他们的方式，以及他们对我们的计划所知道的一切。其中他们还提到了年轻的伯爵，他活泼的个性和对印第安知识的渴望都让他们感到高兴。于是他们诙谐地编造了他和印第安美女的故事，这在我们的混血儿看来很好玩。","Still hoping to reach the camp of the rangers before nightfall, we pushed on until twilight, when we were obliged to halt on the borders of a ravine.The rangers bivouacked under trees, at the bottom of the dell, while we pitched our tent on a rocky knoll near a running stream.The night came on dark and overcast, with flying clouds, and much appearance of rain.The fires of the rangers burnt brightly in the dell, and threw strong masses of light upon the robber-looking groups that were cooking, eating, and drinking around them.To add to the wildness of the scene, several Osage Indians, visitors from the village we had passed, were mingled among the men.Three of them came and seated themselves by our fire.They watched every thing that was going on around them in silence, and looked like figures of monumental bronze.We gave them food, and, what they most relished, coffee; for the Indians partake in the universal fondness for this beverage, which pervades the West.When they had made their supper, they stretched themselves, side by side, before the fire, and began a low nasal chant, drumming with their hands upon their breasts, by way of accompaniment.Their chant seemed to consist of regular staves, every one terminating, not in a melodious cadence, but in the abrupt interjection huh! uttered almost like a hiccup.This chant, we were told by our interpreter, Beatte, related to ourselves, our appearance, our treatment of them, and all that they knew of our plans.In one part they spoke of the young Count, whose animated character and eagerness for Indian enterprise had struck their fancy, and they indulged in some waggery about him and the young Indian beauties, that produced great merriment among our half-breeds."
"这种即兴创作的方式在原始部落是很普遍的，正是以这种方式，配上一些简单的抑扬顿挫的声调，他们唱遍了所有战争和狩猎中的战利品。印第安人比我想象中更频繁地使用幽默和诙谐。","This mode of improvising is common throughout the savage tribes; and in this way, with a few simple inflections of the voice, they chant all their exploits in war and hunting, and occasionally indulge in a vein of comic humor and dry satire, to which the Indians appear to me much more prone than is generally imagined."
"实际上，我有幸在现实生活中所见到的印第安人和诗歌中描绘的很不一样。他们一点儿也不是那种沉默寡言、不懂变通、没有泪水和欢笑的恬淡寡欢之人。和白人一起时，他们确实是沉默寡言的，因为他们不相信对方的好意，也不明白对方的语言，但白人在这种情形下也同样很沉默。然而，当印第安人在他们自己人中间时，就再也没有人比他们更能聊了。他们一半的时间用来讲述自己在打仗和狩猎时的奇遇及古怪可笑的故事。他们是伟大的模仿者和滑稽演员，善于以模仿与他们交往的白人为乐。而那些白人还以为他们是被自己的庄严及尊贵深深折服了呢！他们还是好奇的观察者，默默地打量着一切，目光敏锐而机警。当有什么特别的东西吸引了他们的注意力时，他们会时不时地互相交换目光或嘀咕几句，不过会把所有的评论留到只剩下自己人时再说。到那时，他们就会给出全面的见解：批评、讽刺、模仿，以及欢笑。","In fact, the Indians that I have had an opportunity of seeing in real life are quite different from those described in poetry.They are by no means the stoics that they are represented, taciturn, unbending, without a tear or a smile.Taciturn they are, it is true, when in company with white men, whose goodwill they distrust, and whose language they do not understand; but the white man is equally taciturn under like circumstances.When the Indians are among themselves, however, there cannot be greater gossips.Half their time is taken up in talking over their adventures in war and hunting, and in telling whimsical stories.They are great mimics and buffoons, also, and entertain themselves excessively at the expense of the whites with whom they have associated, and who have supposed them impressed with profound respect for their grandeur and dignity.They are curious observers, noting every thing in silence, but with a keen and watchful eye; occasionally exchanging a glance or a grunt with each other, when any thing particularly strikes them: but reserving all comments until they are alone.Then it is that they give full scope to criticism, satire, mimicry, and mirth."
"在边境上的旅程中，我曾多次感受到他们对自己的狩猎活动的狂热和兴奋，也不时注意到一伙奥塞奇人围在篝火旁，沉浸在最热烈生动的谈话中，直到深夜，他们的笑声还不时地在树林中回荡。至于说泪水，他们有着丰富的储量，有的真诚，有的做作；有时他们也会利用泪水。没有人比他们在亲人或朋友死去时哭得更伤心、更强烈了，他们有固定的时间去墓前悼念哀哭。我曾经在黎明时听到邻近的印第安村落传来的伤心的哭泣声。一些当地居民在那个时刻去墓地为死者凭吊哭泣。我得知，在这种时候，泪水将会像溪流一样沿着他们的脸颊流下。","In the course of my journey along the frontier, I have had repeated opportunities of noticing their excitability and boisterous merriment at their games; and have occasionally noticed a group of Osages sitting round a fire until a late hour of the night, engaged in the most animated and lively conversation; and at times making the woods resound with peals of laughter.As to tears, they have them in abundance, both real and affected; at times they make a merit of them.No one weeps more bitterly or profusely at the death of a relative or friend: and they have stated times when they repair to howl and lament at their graves.I have heard doleful wailings at daybreak, in the neighboring Indian villages, made by some of the inhabitants, who go out at that hour into the fields, to mourn and weep for the dead: at such times, I am told, the tears will stream down their cheeks in torrents."
"在我看来，印第安人之于诗意的故事就如牧羊人之于田园传奇一样，都只是想象力的化身罢了。","As far as I can judge, the Indian of poetical fiction is like the shepherd of pastoral romance, a mere personification of imaginary attributes."
"我们的奥塞奇客人们那带着鼻音的圣歌渐渐停止了，他们用毛毯盖着头，很快便睡着了。不一会儿，除了散落的雨滴拍打帐篷的声音之外，一切都归于寂静。","The nasal chant of our Osage guests gradually died away; they covered their heads with their blankets and fell fast asleep, and in a little while all was silent, except the pattering of scattered rain-drops upon our tent."
"早上，印第安访客们和我们一起吃了早餐，但是那个将成为伯爵的骑士侍从，跟他一起在大草原上行侠仗义的奥塞奇青年却不见了。他的野马也不见了。经过一番猜测之后，我们得出了这样的结论：他在夜里以“印第安方式”离开了我们。我们后来确信，是最近碰到的那些奥塞奇人劝他这样做的。他们向他描绘了他去波尼人的猎场探险时可能会遇到的危险：在那儿，他可能会落入他部落的死对头手中；更不难想到的是，他将会受到白人们反复无常的专横行为的困扰。在我为期不长的旅程中，我就亲眼见过有些白人对待可怜的印第安人比对待野蛮的动物好不了多少。实际上，他自己就已经有过一次这种艰难逃脱的经历：因为找到一匹走失的马这样一桩“罪大恶极”的罪行，他差点儿被那个拼命眨眼的边疆开拓者根据“林奇的律法”对他施以极刑。","In the morning our Indian visitors breakfasted with us, but the young Osage who was to act as esquire to the Count in his knight-errantry on the prairies, was nowhere to be found.His wild horse, too, was missing, and, after many conjectures, we came to the conclusion that he had taken “Indian leave” of us in the night.We afterwards ascertained that he had been persuaded so to do by the Osages we had recently met with; who had represented to him the perils that would attend him in an expedition to the Pawnee hunting grounds, where he might fall into the hands of the implacable enemies of his tribe; and, what was scarcely less to be apprehended, the annoyances to which he would be subjected from the capricious and overbearing conduct of the white men; who, as I have witnessed in my own short experience, are prone to treat the poor Indians as little better than brute animals.Indeed, he had had a specimen of it himself in the narrow escape he made from the infliction of “Lynch’s law,” by the hard-winking worthy of the frontier, for the flagitious crime of finding a stray horse."
"这个年轻人的离开令我们整队的人都感到遗憾，因为我们都很喜欢他英俊、坦率、有男子气概的外表与平和优雅的举止。他实在是个天生的绅士。然而，没有人比年轻的伯爵更伤心的了，他突然发现自己没了侍从。我因那个奥塞奇人的离开为他本人感到可惜，因为我们本应在整个行程中善待他，并且我也相信，从他庇护人的慷慨品德来看，他本可以带着大量的财宝和印第安毛毯回到他的部落的。","The disappearance of the youth was generally regretted by our party, for we had all taken a great fancy to him from his handsome, frank, and manly appearance, and the easy grace of his deportment.He was indeed a native-born gentleman.By none, however, was he so much lamented as by the young Count, who thus suddenly found himself deprived of his esquire.I regretted the departure of the Osage for his own sake, for we should have cherished him throughout the expedition, and I am convinced, from the munificent spirit of his patron, he would have returned to his tribe laden with wealth of beads and trinkets and Indian blankets."

"下了一晚上的雨终于停了。早上七点钟，我们重新开始了征程，满心相信可以很快就会到达巡逻骑兵的营地。我们骑了不到三四英里，就来到了一棵最近刚刚被斧子砍倒的大树旁，因为这树干的洞里有野蜂蜜，还有一些蜂蜜残片。我们现在确定巡逻骑兵的营地就在不远处。又前进了大约两英里后，几个巡逻骑兵喊叫起来,用手指着一群在林木葱郁的谷底吃草的野马。再走几步我们便来到了一道凸起的山脊的顶部，从这里俯瞰，我们看到了营地。它像是一个杂乱的强盗窝，或是罗宾汉式绿林好汉的地盘。在一个美丽而开阔的森林里，一条小溪缓缓流过之处，有一些用树皮和树干搭就的小屋和毛毯做的帐篷，这些都是因最近的雨而搭建的临时避难所，因为巡逻骑兵一般是露营的。不同的巡逻骑兵穿着各式各样的粗糙的衣服。有些人正在树下生的大堆大堆的火上做饭，有些人在铺展整理鹿皮，有些人在对靶射击，还有些人躺在草地上。营地的一侧有一些切成长条、挂在火堆上方用余火烘烤着的鹿肉；另一侧则放着猎人们最近刚刚带回来的猎物尸体。一堆堆的来复枪靠在树干上，马鞍、马笼头和火药筒都挂在树上，而马儿们则在灌木丛中四处吃着草。","The weather, which had been rainy in the night, having held up, we resumed our march at seven o’clock in the morning, in confident hope of soon arriving at the encampment of the rangers.We had not ridden above three or four miles when we came to a large tree which had recently been felled by an axe, for the wild honey contained in the hollow of its trunk, several broken flakes of which still remained.We now felt sure that the camp could not be far distant.About a couple of miles further some of the rangers set up a shout, and pointed to a number of horses grazing in a woody bottom.A few paces brought us to the brow of an elevated ridge, whence we looked down upon the encampment.It was a wild bandit, or Robin Hood, scene.In a beautiful open forest, traversed by a running stream, were booths of bark and branches, and tents of blankets, temporary shelters from the recent rain, for the rangers commonly bivouac in the open air.There were groups of rangers in every kind of uncouth garb.Some were cooking at large fires made at the feet of trees; some were stretching and dressing deer skins; some were shooting at a mark, and some lying about on the grass.Venison jerked, and hung on frames, was drying over the embers in one place; in another lay carcasses recently brought in by the hunters.Stacks of rifles were leaning against the trunks of the trees, and saddles, bridles, and powder-horns hanging above them, while the horses were grazing here and there among the thickets."
"他们热烈欢迎我们的到来。那些巡逻骑兵们围着他们的同伴询问来自要塞的消息，而我们则受到了比恩上校直率简朴的猎人式的接待。他是这支队伍的队长，四十岁上下，充满了活力。他一生中大部分的时光是在边疆上度过的，偶尔参加一些印第安人的战争，所以他是一个完完全全的林中人，是一个一流的猎手。他的穿着很符合自己的性格：皮猎装、皮绑腿，还有一顶皮的军便帽。","Our arrival was greeted with acclamation.The rangers crowded about their comrades to inquire the news from the fort; for our own part, we were received in frank simple hunter’s style by Captain Bean, the commander of the company; a man about forty years of age, vigorous and active.His life had been chiefly passed on the frontier, occasionally in Indian warfare, so that he was a thorough woodsman, and a first-rate hunter.He was equipped in character; in leathern hunting shirt and leggings, and a leathern foraging cap."
"我们正在和队长交谈的时候，一个老练的猎手走了过来，他的模样让我吃了一惊。他中等身材，但是却强壮结实、饱经风霜；头顶有点儿秃，稀稀拉拉地点缀着一绺绺铁灰色的发卷；一只明亮的黑眼睛闪烁着青春的光芒。他的穿着和队长的差不多，看上去显然是经久耐用的鹿皮制猎衣和绑腿；一个火药筒挂在身旁，一把猎刀别在腰带上，手里拿着一只古老但值得信任的来复枪，毫无疑问，这枪就像一个知心朋友那样珍贵。他请求去打猎，并马上就得到了批准。“那人是老赖安，”他走之后队长说，“这个营地里没有比他更好的猎手了，他肯定会带回猎物的。”","While we were conversing with the Captain, a veteran huntsman approached, whose whole appearance struck me.He was of the middle size, but tough and weather-proved; a head partly bald and garnished with loose iron-gray locks, and a fine black eye, beaming with youthful spirit.His dress was similar to that of the Captain, a rifle shirt and leggings of dressed deer skin, that had evidently seen service; a powder-horn was slung by his side, a hunting-knife stuck in his belt, and in his hand was an ancient and trusty rifle, doubtless as dear to him as a bosom friend.He asked permission to go hunting, which was readily granted.“That’s old Ryan,” said the Captain, when he had gone; “there’s not a better hunter in the camp; he’s sure to bring in game.”"
"一会儿的工夫，我们便卸完了驮马背上的东西，放它们在豌豆藤中休息了。我们支起帐篷，生起火，队长那边送来半只鹿，贝蒂也带来两只野火鸡；烤肉叉上插满了肉，露营用的水壶里也塞满了肉；为了使我们的奢侈享受更为圆满，一个巡逻骑兵送来满满一盆美味的大片蜂蜜，那可是从一棵蜜蜂树上掠夺来的。","In a little while our pack-horses were unloaded and turned loose to revel among the pea-vines.Our tent was pitched; our fire made; the half of a deer had been sent to us from the Captain’s lodge; Beatte brought in a couple of wild turkeys; the spits were laden, and the camp-kettle crammed with meat; and to crown our luxuries, a basin filled with great flakes of delicious honey, the spoils of a plundered bee-tree, was given us by one of the rangers."
"我们的小个子法国人托尼什异常兴奋，袖子撸到胳膊肘上，开始施展自己的厨艺。对此他可是很骄傲，就像对自己打猎、骑马和打仗都技艺高超感到骄傲一样。","Our little Frenchman, Tonish, was in an ecstasy, and tucking up his sleeves to the elbows, set to work to make a display of his culinary skill, on which he prided himself almost as much as upon his hunting, his riding, and his warlike prowess."
"第九章 采蜜 ","CHAPTER IX. A BEE HUNT."
"我们宿营的美丽森林里有大量的蜜蜂树,也就是有许多野蜜蜂在腐朽的树干里筑巢的树。令人惊讶的是，不计其数的蜜蜂群仅仅在短短的几年时间里，就遍布了整个远西区。印第安人把它们看成是白人的预兆，并且还说，蜜蜂进多少，印第安人就会退多少。我们通常习惯于把嗡嗡作响的蜂巢和农舍或花园联系起来，把这些勤劳的小动物和繁忙的人类居住地联想在一起。我听说这种野蜜蜂在距离边疆很远的地方是很难碰到的。它们已经成为了文明的预兆。自从文明从大西洋岸边推进以来，它们便始终走在文明之前。在蜜蜂首次越过密西西比河那年，有些西部的老居民就在假装感恩了。印第安人惊讶地发现，他们树林中那些腐朽不堪的树里突然间都注满了芬芳的甜蜜。我还听说，没有任何感觉能超越他们第一次奢侈地享用这种免费野味时所引起的贪婪食欲。","The beautiful forest in which we were encamped abounded in bee-trees; that is to say, trees in the decayed trunks of which wild bees had established their hives.It is surprising in what countless swarms the bees have overspread the Far West, within but a moderate number of years.The Indians consider them the harbinger of the white man; and say that, in proportion as the bee advances, the Indian  retire.We are always accustomed to associate the hum of the bee-hive with the farmhouse and flower-garden, and to consider those industrious little animals as connected with the busy haunts of man, and I am told that the wild bee is seldom to be met with at any great distance from the frontier.They have been the heralds of civilization, steadfastly preceding it as it advanced from the Atlantic borders, and some of the ancient settlers of the West pretend to give the very year when the honey-bee first crossed the Mississippi.The Indians with surprise found the mouldering trees of their forests suddenly teeming with ambrosial sweets, and nothing, I am told, can exceed the greedy relish with which they banquet for the first time upon this unbought luxury of the wilderness."
"目前，不计其数的蜜蜂群穿梭于位于大草原边缘或纵横交错于草原之上、延伸到河流尽头冲击河床上的果树林和森林之中。在我看来，这些美丽的地区恰是应了那句对“希望之地”的描述：“流淌着牛奶和蜂蜜的土地”，因为大草原上富足的牧场足以容纳像沙滩上的沙子一样数不胜数的牧群，而花朵则给草原施上了珐琅釉，把它变成了蜜蜂采撷花蜜的天堂。","At present the honey-bee swarms in myriads, in the noble groves and forests which skirt and intersect the prairies, and extend along the alluvial bottoms of the rivers.It seems to me as if these beautiful regions answer literally to the description of the land of promise, “a land flowing with milk and honey;” for the rich pasturage of the prairies is calculated to sustain herds of cattle as countless as the sands upon the seashore, while the flowers with which they are enamelled render them a very paradise for the nectar-seeking bee."
"我们才在营帐里呆了一小会儿，便有一队人马要出发去找蜜蜂树了。我对这种活动很好奇，很想亲眼目睹一下，于是便欣然答应他们的邀请，同他们一起去。这支队伍由一个采蜜老手和他的搭档带领着：前者是一个有着瘦高身材的家伙，穿着松松垮垮地围在四肢周围的土布衣服，头戴一个与蜂窝像极了的草帽；后者同样穿着粗糙，却没戴帽子，走起路来八字脚，肩上扛着一支长长的来复枪。之后跟着的六七个人，有的带着斧子，有的带着来复枪。为了对付野熊或印第安野人，人们离开营地时都会带上家伙。","We had not been long in the camp when a party set out in quest of a bee-tree; and, being curious to witness the sport, I gladly accepted an invitation to accompany them.The party was headed by a veteran bee-hunter, a tall lank fellow in homespun garb that hung loosely about his limbs, and a straw hat shaped not unlike a bee-hive; a comrade, equally uncouth in garb, and without a hat, straddled along at his heels, with a long rifle on his shoulder.To these succeeded half a dozen others, some with axes and some with rifles, for no one stirs far from the camp without his firearms, so as to be ready either for wild deer or wild Indian."
"走了一段路之后，我们来到了树林边缘一块开阔的沼泽地。在这儿，我们的领头人停了下来，悄悄地赶到了一处低矮的灌木丛下。我发现树丛的上方就是一个蜂巢。我发现的这个蜂巢其实是对野蜜蜂的诱饵。有好几只都在围着它嗡嗡地飞舞，然后冲进小巢。当往自己身上装满蜜之后，它们便飞到空中，然后像出膛的子弹一样，以极快的速度笔直地飞去。猎手们仔细观察着它们所走的路线，然后沿着同样的方向前进，在盘根错节的树根和倒伏的树木之间艰难地蹒跚而行，眼睛还要望着空中。用这种方法，他们跟着带蜜的蜜蜂来到了它们的老巢。这个巢在一棵被蛀空了的橡树树干里，它们在巢的周围嗡嗡地飞了一阵子之后，便钻入了一个离地大约六十英寸的洞里。","After proceeding some distance we came to an open glade on the skirts of the forest.Here our leader halted, and then advanced quietly to a low bush, on the top of which I perceived a piece of honey-comb.This I found was the bait or lure for the wild bees.Several were humming about it, and diving into its cells.When they had laden themselves with honey, they would rise into the air, and dart off in a straight line, almost with the velocity of a bullet.The hunters watched attentively the course they took, and then set off in the same direction, stumbling along over twisted roots and fallen trees, with their eyes turned up to the sky.In this way they traced the honey-laden bees to their hive, in the hollow trunk of a blasted oak, where, after buzzing about for a moment, they entered a hole about sixty feet from the ground."
"此刻，两个采蜜人开始用斧子起劲地砍树的底端，以便把它放倒。同时，所有的旁观者和生手都远远地躲到安全处，以防被倒下的树砸到或遭到里面居民的报复。沉重的砍树声好像并没有惊动或打扰这个最勤劳的群体。它们继续从事着日常工作，有的满载着货物进港，有的匆忙地踏上新的旅程，就好像都市中为钱忙碌的众多商人一样，几乎没有一只蜜蜂意识到即将来临的破产和倒闭。甚至一声宣告树干断裂的巨响，也没能把它们的注意力从那强烈地追求所获得之物的层面上引开。最终大树轰然倒下，从头到尾裂开，把贮藏的所有“公共财宝”展露无遗。","Two of the bee-hunters now plied their axes vigorously at the foot of the tree to level it with the ground.The mere spectators and amateurs, in the meantime, drew off to a cautious distance, to be out of the way of the falling of the tree and the vengeance of its inmates.The jarring blows of the axe seemed to have no effect in alarming or disturbing this most industrious community.They continued to ply at their usual occupations, some arriving full freighted into port, others sallying forth on new expeditions, like so many merchantmen in a money-making metropolis, little suspicious of impending bankruptcy and downfall.Even a loud crack which announced the disrupture of the trunk, failed to divert their attention from the intense pursuit of gain; at length down came the tree with a tremendous crash, bursting open from end to end, and displaying all the hoarded treasures of the commonwealth."
"一个猎手马上手执一束点着的干草跑上前去，以防止蜜蜂的攻击。然而，蜜蜂们却没有采取任何攻击行动，也没有寻求报复；它们似乎震惊于这突如其来的灾难，一点儿也没怀疑它的起因，只是继续在废墟上爬动嗡叫，而没有来侵害我们。此刻，每一个队员都过来用勺子和猎刀来挖取出树洞里储存的片状蜂蜜。其中的一些蜜片时间久远，已经变成了深棕色，其他的则是迷人的白色；而蜂巢孔穴中的蜜则几乎是透明的。那些完整的巢穴，被放在了锅里带回营地；而那些树干倒落时破碎了的蜜片，当场就被狼吞虎咽地吃掉了。每一个健壮的采蜜人手里都有一张厚厚的蜜片，手指间滴着蜜汁；它们很快便消失了，其速度就像是逢年过节时，胃口大开的学童吃掉面前的奶油果馅饼一样。","One of the hunters immediately ran up with a wisp of lighted hay as a defence against the bees.The latter, however, made no attack and sought no revenge; they seemed stupefied by the catastrophe and unsuspicious of its cause, and remained crawling and buzzing about the ruins without offering us any molestation.Every one of the party now fell to, with spoon and hunting-knife, to scoop out the flakes of honey-comb with which the hollow trunk was stored.Some of them were of old date and a deep brown color, others were beautifully white, and the honey in their cells was almost limpid.Such of the combs as were entire were placed in camp kettles to be conveyed to the encampment; those which had been shivered in the fall were devoured upon the spot.Every stark bee-hunter was to be seen with a rich morsel in his hand, dripping about his fingers, and disappearing as rapidly as a cream tart before the holiday appetite of a schoolboy."
"不仅仅是采蜜人从这个倒台的勤劳的群体中受益，蜜蜂们好像也和这些费力获益的人有着相同的习性。我看到许多邻近蜂巢的蜜蜂，急切地扇着翅膀匆匆而来，在邻居的废墟上大捞一把。它们如那些被迫靠岸的印度贸易船上的众多毁船打劫者般，热切、兴奋地忙于抢劫，一头扎入破碎蜂巢的孔穴中，在战利品上贪婪地饱餐一顿，然后挥动着翅膀满载而归。至于那些可怜的废墟主人们，它们似乎没有心情做任何事情，甚至不曾品尝流淌在它们身边的花蜜，而只是前前后后地爬动着，茫然凄凉，就像是我见过的一个可怜的家伙。他站在烧毁的家园旁，双手插在兜里，茫然而沮丧地吹着口哨。","Nor was it the bee-hunters alone that profited by the downfall of this industrious community; as if the bees would carry through the similitude of their habits with those of laborious and gainful man, I beheld numbers from rival hives, arriving on eager wing, to enrich themselves with the ruins of their neighbors.These busied themselves as eagerly and cheerfully as so many wreckers on an Indiaman that has been driven on shore; plunging into the cells of the broken honey-combs, banqueting greedily on the spoil, and then winging their way full-freighted to their homes.As to the poor proprietors of the ruin, they seemed to have no heart to do any thing, not even to taste the nectar that flowed around them; but crawled backward and forward, in vacant desolation, as I have seen a poor fellow with his hands in his pockets, whistling vacantly and despondingly about the ruins of his house that had been burnt."
"那些蜂巢坍塌时不在家的蜜蜂们，现在接二连三地满载着远方的货物回来了，而它们的慌张和迷惑是难以描述的。起初，它们在空中盘旋，愕然地发现这棵倒下的树原本昂着头的地方已经空空如也了。最终，他们似乎是理解了灾难的降临，于是一群群地降落在附近一棵树的干树枝上，好像是在从那里打量这一卧倒的遗址，并嗡嗡地对自己王国的沦陷进行忧伤的悼念。此刻，这倒成了“忧郁的雅克”前来说教的场景。","It is difficult to describe the bewilderment and confusion of the bees of the bankrupt hive who had been absent at the time of the catastrophe, and who arrived from time to time, with full cargoes from abroad.At first they wheeled about in the air, in the place where the fallen tree had once reared its head, astonished at finding it all a vacuum.At length, as if comprehending their disaster, they settled down in clusters on a dry branch of a neighboring tree, whence they seemed to contemplate the prostrate ruin, and to buzz forth doleful lamentations over the downfall of their republic.It was a scene on which the “melancholy Jacques” might have moralized by the hour."
"现在，我们离开了那个地方，树干里还残留着大量的蜂蜜。“它会被害兽收拾干净的。”一个巡逻骑兵说。我问：“什么害兽？”“哦，熊啊，臭鼬啊，浣熊啊，还有负鼠。熊是世界上最会找蜂蜜树的害兽。它们会一起连续几天啃树干，直到啃出一个足够伸进爪子的洞，然后把蜂蜜、蜜蜂，以及所有的一切全部弄出来。”","We now abandoned the place, leaving much honey in the hollow of the tree.“It will all be cleared off by varmint,” said one of the rangers.“What vermin?” asked I.“Oh, bears, and skunks, and racoons, and ’possums.The bears is the knowingest varmint for finding out a bee-tree in the world.They’ll gnaw for days together at the trunk till they make a bole big enough to get in their paws, and then they’ll haul out honey, bees and all.”"
"第十章 营地里的娱乐","CHAPTER X. AMUSEMENTS IN THE CAMP."
"——商议——猎人们的食物与盛宴——夜景——营地上的乐曲——爱好音乐的猫头鹰的命运","—CONSULTATIONS.—HUNTERS’ FARE AND FEASTING.—EVENING SCENES.—CAMP MELODY.—THE FATE OF AN AMATEUR OWL."
"等回到营地，我们发现那里是一片欢乐的景象。有些巡逻骑兵在打靶射击，其余的则在跳跃、摔跤、玩各式各样的游戏。他们大多数是第一次出来远征的年轻人，拥有健康的体魄、充沛的精力和意料之中的活泼。并且，除了野外的丛林生活、壮丽无垠的旷野、数不清的猎物和满载而归的探险，我想不出更能使年轻人热血沸腾的了。我们往往把年轻人送到国外，让他们在欧洲过一种奢华而娇气的生活。这让我想到，一次大草原之旅将更有可能培养人刚毅、朴实和独立的品质，尤其能使他们和我们的政治制度保持一致。","On returning to the camp, we found it a scene of the greatest hilarity.Some of the rangers were shooting at a mark, others were leaping, wrestling, and playing at prison bars.They were mostly young men, on their first expedition, in high health and vigor, and buoyant with anticipations; and I can conceive nothing more likely to set the youthful blood into a flow, than a wild wood life of the kind, and the range of a magnificent wilderness, abounding with game, and fruitful of adventure.We send our youth abroad to grow luxurious and effeminate in Europe; it appears to me, that a previous tour on the prairies would be more likely to produce that manliness, simplicity, and self-dependence, most in unison with our political institutions."
"当年轻人沉浸于这些喧闹的游戏中时，一组由队长、医生、其他德高望重的智者及营地的首领组成的小组，正围着一张边境地图或坐或躺在草地上，商讨着我们的位置及接下来的行程。","While the young men were engaged in these boisterous amusements, a graver set, composed of the Captain, the Doctor, and other sages and leaders of the camp, were seated or stretched out on the grass, round a frontier map, holding a consultation about our position, and the course we were to pursue."
"我们的计划是从雷德福克河汇入阿肯色河处穿过阿肯色河，然后继续向西，直到穿过一处叫“十字木林”的开阔疏林带——它几乎是一直从北面的阿肯色河延伸到南面的雷德河——之后，我们将向南前往雷德河。","Our plan was to cross the Arkansas just above where the Red Fork falls into it, then to keep westerly, until we should pass through a grand belt of open forest, called the Cross Timber, which ranges nearly north and south from the Arkansas to Red River; after which, we were to keep a southerly course toward the latter river."
"我们那经验丰富的奥塞奇猎手，混血儿贝蒂，也被邀请过去参加讨论。“你曾经在这个地方狩过猎吗？”队长问。“是的。”他简洁地回答说。","Our half-breed, Beatte, being an experienced Osage hunter, was called into the consultation.“Have you ever hunted in this direction?” said the Captain.“Yes,” was the laconic reply."
"“那也许，你能够告诉我们雷德福克河在哪个方位？”","“Perhaps, then, you can tell us in which direction lies the Red Fork?”"
"“如果你们沿着大草原的边缘行走，将会到达一座光秃秃的、有一大堆石头的小山。”","“If you keep along yonder, by the edge of the prairie, you will come to a bald hill, with a pile of stones upon it.”"
"“我打猎的时候注意到过那座山。”队长说道。","“I have noticed that hill as I was hunting,” said the Captain."
"“对啊！那些石头是奥塞奇人堆到那儿用来作路标的：从那儿你们就有可能看到雷德福克河了。”","“Well! those stones were set up by the Osages as a landmark: from that spot you may have a sight of the Red Fork.”"
"“那样的话，”队长叫道，“我们明天就能到达雷德福克河，然后穿过它前面的阿肯色河，进入波尼族人的领地，接下来两天之内我们就可以去砸碎野牛的骨头了！”","“In that case,” cried the Captain, “we shall reach the Red Fork to-morrow; then cross the Arkansas above it, into the Pawnee country, and then in two days we shall crack buffalo bones!”"
"一想到马上就要到达波尼族人充满危险的猎场，以及即将出现的野牛的行踪，他们的眼睛里就都闪烁出了兴奋的光芒。我们进一步的谈话被营地不远处一声刺耳的来复枪响给打断了。","The idea of arriving at the adventurous hunting grounds of the Pawnees, and of coming upon the traces of the buffaloes, made every eye sparkle with animation.Our further conversation was interrupted by the sharp report of a rifle at no great distance from the camp."
"“那是老瑞安的来复枪，”队长呼喊道，“我敢担保，一只雄鹿倒下了。”他说得不错，因为没过多久，那个老手就出现了。他叫了一个年轻点儿的巡逻骑兵和他一起回去帮忙抬回猎物。","“That’s old Ryan’s rifle,” exclaimed the Captain; “there’s a buck down, I’ll warrant!”Nor was he mistaken; for, before long, the veteran made his appearance, calling upon one of the younger rangers to return with him, and aid in bringing home the carcass."
"事实上，周围到处都是猎物，所以营地的食物多得吃不完，而且附近至少已经砍倒二十棵蜂蜜树了，所以每个人都陶醉于这奢侈的生活之中。由于猎人式的挥霍浪费，酒宴持续不断地举行着，几乎没有人为明天储备给养。烹饪是以猎人们的方式进行的：将肉穿在尖锐的、笔直地插进土里的山茱萸枝上，使它们能连在一起在火前烤。这样烤肉，肉汁会全部保存在肉里。用这种方式烤出来的肉，即使是尝遍山珍海味的美食家也会垂涎三尺。至于做面包的诸多好方法也无法细说了。不过就是将面粉和水混在一起的面团剁碎了在猪油里炸，也有些人采取了一种更野蛮的方式：把面团绕在棍子的一头，然后在火上烤。我发现，在大草原上用这两种方式做出来的面包都非常美味。一个人只有吃过了猎人们的食物之后，才知道什么是人间真正的美味。","The surrounding country, in fact, abounded with game, so that the camp was overstocked with provisions, and, as no less than twenty bee-trees had been cut down in the vicinity, every one revelled in luxury.With the wasteful prodigality of hunters, there was a continual feasting, and scarce any one put by provision for the morrow.The cooking was conducted in hunter’s style: the meat was stuck upon tapering spits of dogwood, which were thrust perpendicularly into the ground, so as to sustain the joint before the fire, where it was roasted or broiled with all its juices retained in it in a manner that would have tickled the palate of the most experienced gourmand.As much could not be said in favor of the bread.It was little more than a paste made of flour and water, and fried like fritters, in lard; though some adopted a ruder style, twisting it round the ends of sticks, and thus roasting it before the fire.In either way, I have found it extremely palatable on the prairies.No one knows the true relish of food until he has a hunter’s appetite."
"太阳下山前，我们被小托尼什请去参加一个奢华的宴会。毛毯已经围着篝火铺好了，我们在上面坐了下来。我们面前的地上摆着从印第安村庄买来的用枫树根做成的大盘，或者说是大碗，里面装了整整一大锅的东西，有切碎的野火鸡肉、一片片的熏肉及一块块的面团。它旁边还放着另一个相似的碗一样的器皿，里面有很多油炸馅饼。我们聊了一阵火鸡肉之后，小托尼什拿过来两个木制的烤肉叉插在我们面前的地上，上面是在火前烤好的肥美的雄鹿肋排肉，空气里弥漫着令人喜悦的肉香。由于没有盘子，我们不得不像猎人那样，用猎刀把肉成条或成片地切下来，然后蘸上盐和胡椒粉来吃。为了公正地评价托尼什的厨艺和大草原上美味调料，我想说的是，我从没有吃过这么鲜美的鹿肉。我们就着这些食物喝的饮料是在野营用的水壶里煮的咖啡。我们在咖啡里面加了红糖，装在锡杯里喝。只要食物供给充分，只要面粉、咖啡和糖还可以维持供应，这就是我们整个探险过程中典型的宴会。","Before sunset, we were summoned by little Tonish to a sumptuous repast.Blankets had been spread on the ground near to the fire, upon which we took our seats.A large dish, or bowl, made from the root of a maple tree, and which we had purchased at the Indian village, was placed on the ground before us, and into it were emptied the contents of one of the camp kettles, consisting of a wild turkey hashed, together with slices of bacon and lumps of dough.Beside it was placed another bowl of similar ware, containing an ample supply of fritters.After we had discussed the hash, two wooden spits, on which the ribs of a fat buck were broiling before the fire, were removed and planted in the ground before us, with a triumphant air, by little Tonish.Having no dishes, we had to proceed in hunter’s style, cutting off strips and slices with our hunting-knives, and dipping them in salt and pepper.To do justice to Tonish’s cookery, however, and to the keen sauce of the prairies, never have I tasted venison so delicious.With all this, our beverage was coffee, boiled in a camp kettle, sweetened with brown sugar, and drunk out of tin cups: and such was the style of our banqueting throughout this expedition, whenever provisions were plenty, and as long as flour and coffee and sugar held out."
"天色渐渐暗了下来，哨兵们走向营地周围的哨岗。在这个充满印第安人的地方，这种防范是必不可少的。此刻，营地呈现出一幅美丽如画的景象。树林间点点篝火闪耀着，周围围着一群群的巡逻骑兵，有的在地上坐着或躺着，有的或站在闪着红光的火焰边上，或站在火光照不到的阴影里。不少火堆旁充满了欢笑，其间夹杂着响亮的下流笑话和粗俗的呼喊声。显而易见的是，这支部队的成员都是新手，未经训练，他们是从边境上粗野的年轻人中招募来的。他们应征入伍，有的是为了来这里冒冒险，有的是为了了解一下这片土地。他们中许多人都是自己长官的邻居，也已经习惯了把军官当成和自己地位相等的密友和伙伴。他们都不知道军队的纪律和礼貌，也没有人打算为继续自己的军队生涯而去培养这一职业所必需的严谨素质。","As the twilight thickened into night, the sentinels were marched forth to their stations around the camp; an indispensable precaution in a country infested by Indians.The encampment now presented a picturesque appearance.Camp fires were blazing and smouldering here and there among the trees, with groups of rangers round them; some seated or lying on the ground, others standing in the ruddy glare of the flames, or in shadowy relief.At some of the fires there was much boisterous mirth, where peals of laughter were mingled with loud ribald jokes and uncouth exclamations; for the troop was evidently a raw, undisciplined band, levied among the wild youngsters of the frontier, who had enlisted, some for the sake of roving adventure, and some for the purpose of getting a knowledge of the country.Many of them were the neighbors of their officers, and accustomed to regard them with the familiarity of equals and companions.None of them had any idea of the restraint and decorum of a camp, or ambition to acquire a name for exactness in a profession in which they had no intention of continuing."
"一些篝火旁的人们正处在一片喧腾嬉戏之中时，另一堆篝火旁突然发出一阵带着鼻音的哼唱。在那里，唱诗班的“歌手们”一起哼出了一首悲怆至极的圣歌曲调。这是由一个中尉领头哼唱的。他高高瘦瘦的，听说是来自边境的一个村庄，原是一个校长兼音乐教师，偶尔也做做卫理公会派的牧师。这庄严而悲凉的圣歌飘荡在夜空之中，我不禁想起了对国民誓约派成员营地里相似圣歌的描述。实际上，我们这支由形态各异、穿着粗俗的各色人等拼凑起来的部队所唱的，并没有使人感到是对这圣歌的侮辱。","While this boisterous merriment prevailed at some of the fires, there suddenly rose a strain of nasal melody from another, at which a choir of “vocalists” were uniting their voices in a most lugubrious psalm tune.This was led by one of the lieutenants; a tall, spare man, who we were informed had officiated as schoolmaster, singing-master, and occasionally as Methodist preacher, in one of the villages of the frontier.The chant rose solemnly and sadly in the night air, and reminded me of the description of similar canticles in the camps of the Covenanters; and, indeed, the strange medley of figures and faces and uncouth garbs, congregated together in our troop, would not have disgraced the banners of Praise-God Barebones."
"在唱这首带着鼻音的赞美诗的间隙，一只爱好音乐的猫头鹰开始了它那沉闷的叫声，好像是要比赛似的。马上整个营地都在呼喊：“查理的猫头鹰！查理的猫头鹰！”","In one of the intervals of this nasal psalmody, an amateur owl, as if in competition, began his dreary hooting.Immediately there was a cry throughout the camp of “Charley’s owl! Charley’s owl!"""
"这只“无名鸟”似乎每晚都来拜访过营地，并曾经被一个名叫查理的缺根筋的哨兵打了一枪，所以，虽然他辩解说他知道用猫头鹰可以做出不同寻常的好汤来，但只要他值班，就会让人们想起开枪事件。","It seems this “obscure bird” had visited the camp every night, and had been fired at by one of the sentinels, a half-witted lad, named Charley; who, on being called up for firing when on duty, excused himself by saying, that he understood owls made uncommonly good soup."
"其中一个年轻的巡逻骑兵模仿起这种智慧之鸟的叫声。这只鸟径直地盘旋着进入了我们的视线，然后落在了光秃秃的树枝上，映现在火堆的光辉之中。这可不是它的性格啊。年轻的伯爵马上抓起他的猎枪，瞄准之后给了它致命的一枪。转瞬间，那只可怜的预示着凶兆的鸟儿就在地上不断地挣扎了。这时，查理被叫过来做他要喝的猫头鹰汤，但是他拒绝了，理由是这不是他亲手打下来的。","One of the young rangers mimicked the cry of this bird of wisdom, who, with a simplicity little consonant with his character, came hovering within sight, and alighted on the naked branch of a tree, lit up by the blaze of our fire.The young Count immediately seized his fowling-piece, took fatal aim, and in a twinkling the poor bird of ill omen came fluttering to the ground.Charley was now called upon to make and eat his dish of owl-soup, but declined, as he had not shot the bird."
"夜间，我去队长的篝火处拜访了一下。那里烧着一些足够用来烤一整头野牛的巨大树干。在这里有许多一流的猎手和营地的首领。他们有的坐着，有的站着，还有的躺在火堆前的兽皮或毯子上，正讲述着边境上关于狩猎和印第安战争的古老故事。","In the course of the evening, I paid a visit to the Captain’s fire.It was composed of huge trunks of trees, and of sufficient magnitude to roast a buffalo whole.Here were a number of the prime hunters and leaders of the camp, some sitting, some standing, and others lying on skins or blankets before the fire, telling old frontier stories about hunting and Indian warfare."
"夜色更深了，我们注意到，在西边树林的上方，一片火光把天空映成了红色。","As the night advanced, we perceived above the trees to the west, a ruddy glow flushing up the sky."
"“那一定是奥塞奇猎手点燃了大草原。”队长说道。","“That must be a prairie set on fire by the Osage hunters,” said the Captain."
"“那是在雷德福克河边上，”贝蒂看着天空说，“那看起来也就只有三英里远，不过也有可能是二十英里。”","“It is at the Red Fork,” said Beatte, regarding the sky.“It seems but three miles distant, yet it perhaps is twenty.”"
"大约是在八点半之后，一片美丽的白光渐渐从东方涌现，那是月亮升起的征兆。从队长的住处离开后，我准备去休息。我已经决定不再受帐篷的庇护了，从今以后，我要像巡逻骑兵们那样露宿。一张铺在树下的熊皮是我的床，一副马褡裢就是我的枕头。把自己裹在毯子里之后，我舒服地躺在这种猎人的沙发上，很快便进入了香甜的梦乡，直到破晓的军号声响起时，我才醒来。","About half past eight o’clock, a beautiful pale light gradually sprang up in the east, a precursor of the rising moon.Drawing off from the Captain’s lodge, I now prepared for the night’s repose.I had determined to abandon the shelter of the tent, and henceforth to bivouac like the rangers.A bearskin spread at the foot of a tree was my bed, with a pair of saddle-bags for a pillow.Wrapping myself in blankets, I stretched myself on this hunter’s couch, and soon fell into a sound and sweet sleep, from which I did not awake until the bugle sounded at daybreak."
"第十一章 拆帐篷","CHAPTER XI. BREAKING UP OF THE ENCAMPMENT."
"——美丽如画的旅行——猎物——营地景色——一个年轻猎手的胜利——老猎手的失败——对一只臭鼬的残害","—PICTURESQUE MARCH.—GAME.—CAMP SCENES.—TRIUMPH OF A YOUNG HUNTER.—ILL SUCCESS OF OLD HUNTERS.—FOUL MURDER OF A POLECAT."
"40830.0——作为信号的号角声响起，哨兵和巡逻兵们从营地周围的岗位上撤了回来解散了。巡逻骑兵们纷纷从睡梦中醒来，很快，营地便呈现出一派忙碌的景象。有的在砍柴生火准备早饭，有的收拾起挡风遮雨的毛毯为出发作准备，还有的飞快地穿过灌木去寻找马，并把它们牵回或赶回营地。在这段忙乱的时间里，树林里高喊声、欢笑声交织成一片。当所有人吃完早饭，打包好行李和野营装备，并放在驮马背上之后，号角声响起，告诉大家备鞍上马出发。八点钟的时候，整支队伍排成一长溜出发了，吆喝声不绝于耳，其中还夹杂着对磨磨蹭蹭的驮马的咒骂声。不一会儿，这个这几天来被不常见的纷乱和喧闹所充斥的森林，又恢复了原始的孤寂。","OCTOBER 14TH.—At the signal note of the bugle, the sentinels and patrols marched in from their stations around the camp and were dismissed.The rangers were roused from their night’s repose, and soon a bustling scene took place.While some cut wood, made fires, and prepared the morning’s meal, others struck their foul-weather shelters of blankets, and made every preparation for departure; while others dashed about, through brush and brake, catching the horses and leading or driving them into camp.During all this bustle the forest rang with whoops, and shouts, and peals of laughter; when all had breakfasted, packed up their effects and camp equipage, and loaded the pack-horses, the bugle sounded to saddle and mount.By eight o’clock the whole troop set off in a long straggling line, with whoop and halloo, intermingled with many an oath at the loitering pack-horses, and in a little while the forest, which for several days had been the scene of such unwonted bustle and uproar, relapsed into its primeval solitude and silence."
"这是一个阳光明媚的早上，纯净透明的空气使人心情愉悦。我们继续沿着与阿肯色河平行的路线前进，途经了一片富饶而又景色各异的土地。有时我们不得不穿越覆盖着茂密植物的冲击河谷，那里的参天大树上，缠结的葡萄藤像绳索一样从树枝上悬垂下来；有时我们沿着水流缓慢的小溪前进，那涓涓细流连接着一些像镜子般镶嵌在静谧树林深处的清澈水塘，水里倒映着片片秋叶和湛蓝的天空。有时我们要爬上连绵起伏、乱石林立的小山，在视野开阔山顶上，极目远眺，一边是远方点缀着大小树林的大草原，另一边是阿肯色河之外灰蒙蒙的连绵山峦。","It was a bright sunny morning, with a pure transparent atmosphere that seemed to bathe the very heart with gladness.Our march continued parallel to the Arkansas, through a rich and varied country; sometimes we had to break our way through alluvial bottoms matted with redundant vegetation, where the gigantic trees were entangled with grape-vines, hanging like cordage from their branches; sometimes we coasted along sluggish brooks, whose feebly trickling current just served to link together a succession of glassy pools, imbedded like mirrors in the quiet bosom of the forest, reflecting its autumnal foliage, and patches of the clear blue sky.Sometimes we scrambled up broken and rocky hills, from the summits of which we had wide views stretching on one side over distant prairies diversified by groves and forests, and on the other ranging along a line of blue and shadowy hills beyond the waters of the Arkansas."
"我们队伍的整体形象与乡间的景色融为一体，长达半英里的队伍蜿蜒在灌木丛林中，行走于山间隘路上，人们穿着各式粗陋的衣服，肩上扛着长来复枪，骑着颜色各异的马匹。驮马也时不时地从队伍中间溜出去，去吃路边的野草，然后托尼什和他的混血儿同伴把它们打回来，并用混杂的咒骂声连珠炮般地驱赶着。时不时地从队伍前端传来的号角声，在林地中回响，在幽谷中回荡，召唤着落伍者并表明前进的方向。整个场景使我想起了对西印度洋海盗穿越南美荒原，袭击西班牙殖民地的描述。","The appearance of our troop was suited to the country; stretching along in a line of upward of half a mile in length, winding among brakes and bushes, and up and down in the defiles of the hills, the men in every kind of uncouth garb, with long rifles on their shoulders, and mounted on horses of every color.The pack-horses, too, would incessantly wander from the line of march, to crop the surrounding herbage, and were banged and beaten back by Tonish and his half-breed compeers, with volleys of mongrel oaths.Every now and then the notes of the bugle, from the head of the column, would echo through the woodlands and along the hollow glens, summoning up stragglers, and announcing the line of march.The whole scene reminded me of the description given of bands of buccaneers penetrating the wilds of South America, on their plundering expeditions against the Spanish settlements."
"有一段时间，我们行走在一个肥沃的河谷，或者说是一片由灌木林围绕的草地，那里高高的野草被前一个晚上在此栖息的野鹿压出了无数的“鹿床”。一些橡树上也留下了想要摘橡树果的熊所攀爬过的痕迹，树皮上熊爪的印记清晰可辨。","At one time we passed through a luxuriant bottom or meadow bordered by thickets, where the tall grass was pressed down into numerous “deer beds,” where those animals had couched the preceding night.Some oak trees also bore signs of having been clambered by bears, in quest of acorns, the marks of their claws being visible in the bark."
"在这片被包围的草地上开辟道路时，我们看到几只鹿在极度惊慌中蹦蹦跳跳地逃开，直到跑开一段距离之后，它们才停下来，带着这一动物惯有的好奇表情回头观望打破它们孤寂世界的陌生入侵者。四处马上响起了尖锐的枪声，那是队伍中年轻的猎手们打的，但是他们太心急了，没有瞄准，于是野鹿们毫发无伤地窜进了树林深处。","As we opened a glade of this sheltered meadow we beheld several deer bounding away in wild affright, until, having gained some distance, they would stop and gaze back, with the curiosity common to this animal, at the strange intruders into their solitudes.There was immediately a sharp report of rifles in every direction, from the young huntsmen of the troop, but they were too eager to aim surely, and the deer, unharmed, bounded away into the depths of the forest."
"行军途中，我们来到了阿肯色河，但却发现我们仍然位于雷德福克河的下方。由于河拐了一个大弯，所以我们再度离开河岸，继续穿越树林。直到将近八点时，我们才在一处紧挨着一条溪流、由一丛丛高大橡树遮蔽着的美丽盆地上驻扎下来。","In the course of our march we struck the Arkansas, but found ourselves still below the Red Fork, and, as the river made deep bends, we again left its banks and continued through the woods until nearly eight o’clock, when we encamped in a beautiful basin bordered by a fine stream, and shaded by clumps of lofty oaks."
"我们将马匹们捆住，具体地说，将它们的前腿用绳索或皮带捆住，以限制它们的行动，防止它们从营地走失。然后我们把它们放开，让它们吃草去了。一些巡逻队员和第一流的猎手，向不同的方向进发，去寻找猎物。整个营地里没有了早上的那种高喊声和欢笑声，大家要么忙着生火准备做晚饭，要么在草地上休息。不久，枪声从不同的方向传来。一会儿工夫之后，一个猎手骑着马进入了营地，马背上驮着一只硕大的雄鹿的尸体。又过了一小会儿，几个年轻的猎手徒步走了回来，其中一个肩上扛着一只母鹿的尸体。虽然他和他的同伴因为刚刚开始打猎，所以一起前去，因而受到了其余同伴的嘲笑，但很显然他为自己的猎物感到骄傲，也许这是他第一次打到猎物呢！","The horses were now hobbled, that is to say, their fore legs were fettered with cords or leathern straps, so as to impede their movements, and prevent their wandering from the camp.They were then turned loose to graze.A number of rangers, prime hunters, started off in different directions in search of game.There was no whooping nor laughing about the camp as in the morning; all were either busy about the fires preparing the evening’s repast, or reposing upon the grass.Shots were soon heard in various directions.After a time a huntsman rode into the camp with the carcass of a fine buck hanging across his horse.Shortly afterward came in a couple of stripling hunters on foot, one of whom bore on his shoulders the body of a doe.He was evidently proud of his spoil, being probably one of his first achievements, though he and his companion were much bantered by their comrades, as young beginners who hunted in partnership."
"夜幕刚刚降临，营地的一头就响起了一阵高喊声。马上，一帮年轻的巡逻骑兵游走在各个火堆之间，肩上扛着他们一个凯旋的同伴。他生平第一次打死了一头麋鹿，这也是我们这次远足以来第一次打到这种猎物。当晚，这个名叫米莱伦的年轻猎手成了营地的英雄。此外，他还是“晚宴之父”，因为每个火堆上都在烤他的麋鹿。","Just as the night set in, there was a great shouting at one end of the camp, and immediately afterward a body of young rangers came parading round the various fires, bearing one of their comrades in triumph on their shoulders.He had shot an elk for the first time in his life, and it was the first animal of the kind that had been killed on this expedition.The young huntsman, whose name was M’Lellan, was the hero of the camp for the night, and was the “father of the feast” into the bargain; for portions of his elk were seen roasting at every fire."
"其余的猎手们则空手而归。队长发现了肯定是几天前刚刚经过这里的野牛的踪迹。他还循着一头熊的踪迹追了一段距离，直到最终脚印消失为止。他也在阿肯色河的岸边发现了一只麋鹿，它走到了河口沙洲上。可他还没来得及偷偷拔枪射击，它便退回到树林中去了。","The other hunters returned without success.The Captain had observed the tracks of a buffalo, which must have passed within a few days, and had tracked a bear for some distance until the foot-prints had disappeared.He had seen an elk, too, on the banks of the Arkansas, which walked out on a sand-bar of the river, but before he could steal round through the bushes to get a shot, it had re-entered the woods."
"我们自己的猎手贝蒂一言不发、闷闷不乐地回来了，他也一无所获。由于他没有给我们带回任何东西，所以我们只好分享属于队长的那份鹿肉了。很显然，贝蒂觉得很丢人，因为他看不起那些巡逻骑兵，认为他们是乳臭未干、毫无经验的山林人；另一方面，他们也看不起他，认为他来自于一个邪恶的种族，还总管他叫“印第安人”。","Our own hunter, Beatte, returned silent and sulky, from an unsuccessful hunt.As yet he had brought us in nothing, and we had depended for our supplies of venison upon the Captain’s mess.Beatte was evidently mortified, for he looked down with contempt upon the rangers, as raw and inexperienced woodsmen, but little skilled in hunting; they, on the other hand, regarded Beatte with no very complacent eye, as one of an evil breed, and always spoke of him as “the Indian.”"
"我们的小个子法国人托尼什还是喜欢用他那混杂的方言，喋喋不休地自吹自擂，满嘴胡言乱语。队伍里那些爱说笑的人总是拿他寻开心，他们肆无忌惮地奚落和嘲笑他；可是这个小无赖完全被虚荣心和自负所蒙蔽，所以他对所有的讽刺挖苦都不以为意。然而，我必须承认，我们的随从总是在那些边陲强盗们当中出洋相，这使我感到很丢人。甚至连我们的装备也不受欢迎，我听到我们用来打小猎物的双筒枪遭到了很多的讥笑。他们轻蔑地称我们是手持“猎枪”的西部小家伙。松鸡、鹑鸡之类的小东西，甚至是火鸡，他们都瞧不上眼，他们认为步枪是唯一值得猎手装备的武器。","Our little Frenchman, Tonish, also, by his incessant boasting, and chattering, and gasconading, in his balderdashed dialect, had drawn upon himself the ridicule of many of the wags of the troop, who amused themselves at his expense in a kind of raillery by no means remarkable for its delicacy; but the little varlet was so completely fortified by vanity and self-conceit, that he was invulnerable to every joke.I must confess, however, that I felt a little mortified at the sorry figure our retainers were making among these moss-troopers of the frontier.Even our very equipments came in for a share of unpopularity, and I heard many sneers at the double-barrelled guns with which we were provided against smaller game; the lads of the West holding “shot-guns,” as they call them, in great contempt, thinking grouse, partridges, and even wild turkeys as beneath their serious attention, and the rifle the only firearm worthy of a hunter."
"第二天早上破晓之前，我便被一只狼的悲号给惊醒了。它被鹿肉的香味所吸引，偷偷地徘徊在营地的边缘。黎明第一抹光亮刚刚降临，一个远处小屋里的年轻人便醒了过来。他模仿起一只公鸡啼叫，音色清朗明亮、抑扬顿挫，堪与最老练的公鸡相媲美。马上，另一个屋子传来回应，好像是来自于一只相匹敌的雄鸡。叫声在所有的屋子间回荡，随后又响起了母鸡的咯咯声，鸭子的呷呷声，火鸡的嘎嘎声，以及猪的咕噜声——我们恍如置身于一个农家庭院，所有家禽的叫声在我们周围响成一片。","I was awakened before daybreak the next morning, by the mournful howling of a wolf, who was skulking about the purlieus of the camp, attracted by the scent of venison.Scarcely had the first gray streak of dawn appeared, when a youngster at one of the distant lodges, shaking off his sleep, crowed in imitation of a cock, with a loud clear note and prolonged cadence, that would have done credit to the most veteran chanticleer.He was immediately answered from another quarter, as if from a rival rooster.The chant was echoed from lodge to lodge, and followed by the cackling of hens, quacking of ducks, gabbling of turkeys, and grunting of swine, until we seemed to have been transported into the midst of a farmyard, with all its inmates in full concert around us."
"这天早上骑了一小段距离之后，我们来到了一条古老的印第安小径。沿着它我们一路爬上了一座山丘的顶端。那里视野非常开阔，眼前是一望无际的乡村景象：有岩石嶙峋的山脊和高低起伏的丘陵，还有小树林和各种矮树丛点缀其间。朝西面远眺，我们欣喜地发现雷德福克河一路奔腾涌入阿肯色河，而我们正处在两河交汇处的上方。我们费力地下着山，并艰难前行，之后穿过了阿肯色河旁边林木茂盛的冲积河谷。这里，树上都缠绕着葡萄藤，像绳索似的，从这个树干缠到那个树干，从这个树枝绕到那个树枝；这里还有低矮浓密的灌木丛和荆棘，以及大量适于采集的啤酒花草——这一切使我们的马举步维艰。","After riding a short distance this morning, we came upon a well-worn Indian track, and following it, scrambled to the summit of a hill, whence we had a wide prospect over a country diversified by rocky ridges and waving lines of upland, and enriched by groves and clumps of trees of varied tuft and foliage.At a distance to the west, to our great satisfaction, we beheld the Red Fork rolling its ruddy current to the Arkansas, and found that we were above the point of junction We now descended and pushed forward, with much difficulty, through the rich alluvial bottom that borders the Arkansas.Here the trees were interwoven with grape-vines, forming a kind of cordage, from trunk to trunk and limb to limb; there was a thick undergrowth, also, of bush and bramble, and such an abundance of hops, fit for gathering, that it was difficult for our horses to force their way through."
"地面上的许多地方都留下了鹿的脚印，在很多树上我们也发现了熊的掌印。每一个人都警惕起来，希望能惊动某个猎物。突然，队伍的远端响起一阵纷乱的叫嚷声。有人叫喊道：“一头熊！一头熊！”我们都向前拥挤着，想看个究竟。可让我感到苦恼莫名的是，竟是我们的两个宝贝——贝蒂和托尼什，残忍地射杀了一只臭鼬。这只动物之前隐藏在一棵倒在地上的树的树干后面，在那儿它以自己特有的方式拼命保护自己，直到周围的树林里都弥漫着那浓烈的“香味”。","The soil was imprinted in many places with the tracks of deer, and the claws of bears were to be traced on various trees.Every one was on the look-out in the hope of starting some game, when suddenly there was a bustle and a clamor in a distant part of the line.“A bear! a bear! ” was the cry.We all pressed forward to be present at the sport, when to my infinite, though whimsical chagrin, I found it to be our two worthies, Beatte and Tonish, perpetrating a foul murder on a polecat, or skunk!The animal had ensconced itself beneath the trunk of a fallen tree, whence it kept up a vigorous defence in its peculiar style, until the surrounding forest was in a high state of fragrance."
"嘲弄和讥笑立刻从四面八方涌向了这个印第安猎手。人们建议他戴上这只臭鼬的头皮，作为对其赫赫战功的奖励。然而，当发现他和托尼什决意要把这只猎物作为特殊的美味时，他们都摆出一副厌恶的表情，认为他们比食人者强不到哪儿去。","Gibes and jokes now broke out on all sides at the expense of the Indian hunter, and he was advised to wear the scalp of the skunk as the only trophy of his prowess.When they found, however, that he and Tonish were absolutely bent upon bearing off the carcass as a peculiar dainty, there was a universal expression of disgust; and they were regarded as little better than cannibals."
"我们这两位猎手不光彩的登台亮相使我感到很羞愧，所以我坚决要求他们放弃战利品，重新上路。贝蒂固执而又不情愿地答应了，自己嘀嘀咕咕地落到了队伍后面。然而，托尼什带着他惯有的乐观，高声地赞叹着烤臭鼬的肥美，他发誓说这是所有有经验的印第安美食家公认的最可口的佳肴。我蛮横地重复了好几次命令，才好不容易让他那聒噪的嘴安静下来。然而，一个法国人的活泼天性如果以一种方式压制住了，就会以另一种方式爆发出来。现在托尼什把他的恼怒发泄到对驮马的不断咒骂上。我不愿迁就这两个无赖的情绪，可最终我似乎并不是胜利者。因为一段时间后，落在后面的贝蒂骑马跑到了队伍的前面，重新担当起向导的职责，而我气恼地发现，他的战利品已经被剥了皮，像一只肥肥的小乳猪一样，挂在他马鞍的后面。然而，我悄悄地郑重发誓，我们的篝火绝不能因烤这只臭鼬而受到侮辱。","Mortified at this ignominious debut of our two hunters, I insisted upon their abandoning their prize and resuming their march.Beatte complied with a dogged, discontented air, and lagged behind muttering to himself.Tonish, however, with his usual buoyancy, consoled himself by vociferous eulogies on the richness and delicacy of a roasted polecat, which he swore was considered the daintiest of dishes by all experienced Indian gourmands.It was with difficulty I could silence his loquacity by repeated and peremptory commands.A Frenchman’s vivacity, however, if repressed in one way, will break out in another and Tonish now eased off his spleen by bestowing volleys of oaths and dry blows on the pack-horses.I was likely to be no gainer in the end, by my opposition to the humors of these varlets, for after a time, Beatte, who had lagged behind, rode up to the head of the line to resume his station as a guide, and I had the vexation to see the carcass of his prize, stripped of its skin, and looking like a fat sucking pig, dangling behind his saddle.I made a solemn vow, however, in secret, that our fire should not be disgraced by the cooking of that polecat."
"第十二章 跨越阿肯色河","CHAPTER XII. THE CROSSING OF THE ARKANSAS."
"我们在雷德福克河河口之上大约四分之一英里的地方，到达了河边。但是这里的河岸既陡又疏松，并且水流又深又湍急。因此，在这个地方渡河是不可能的。于是我们又重新开始了穿越森林的痛苦旅程，并让贝蒂先去寻找渡河的地点。我们又继续走了大约一英里之后，他和我们汇合了。他告诉我们附近有个地方河流的大部分是沙洲，剩下的水域马也很容易游过去。","We had now arrived at the river, about a quarter of a mile above the junction of the Red Fork; but the banks were steep and crumbling, and the current was deep and rapid.It was impossible, therefore, to cross at this place; and we resumed our painful course through the forest, dispatching Beatte ahead, in search of a fording place.We had proceeded about a mile farther, when he rejoined us, bringing intelligence of a place hard by, where the river, for a great part of its breadth, was rendered fordable by sand-bars, and the remainder might easily be swam by the horses."
"然后，我们就在这儿停了下来。有些巡逻骑兵拿着斧子，开始精神抖擞地劳作了。他们砍倒岸边的树做成筏子，用来运他们的行李和野营装备。还有一些人又对更远处的河岸勘察了一番，希望可以找到一个更适合渡河的地点，而不愿让他们的马在这深深的河道中冒险。","Here, then, we made a halt.Some of the rangers set to work vigorously with their axes, felling trees on the edge of the river, wherewith to form rafts for the transportation of their baggage and camp equipage.Others patrolled the banks of the river farther up, in hopes of finding a better fording place; being unwilling to risk their horses in the deep channel."
"也正是这时，我们的宝贝贝蒂和托尼什，有了一个展示他们印第安人聪明才智的机会。在我们一两天前经过的那个奥塞奇村庄，他们讨得了一张干野牛皮。现在，这个派上了用场；他们在它上面凿上了许多小孔，把绳子从中穿过去，然后，把它吊起来，直到形成一种深槽。接着又将几根棍子从里面横穿过去，以使它保持形状。我们将野营装备和部分行李放到了这一张牛皮里，并把它带下岸放到了水中。贝蒂将绳子的一头系在牛皮的前端，另一头用牙咬着，然后跳到了水里，拖着皮囊小船一路涉水前进，而托尼什则跟在皮囊后面，一边保持它的平衡，一边推着它。有一段路他们有立足点，可以涉水前进，但在主流处，他们不得不游泳。这个过程中，他们一直用印第安人的方式高声叫喊，直到安全抵达对岸。专员和我对这种印第安人的摆渡方式都非常满意，所以我们也决定用这张牛皮过河。我们的同伴——那个伯爵和L.先生，骑着马沿着河岸继续前进，寻找那几个巡逻骑兵在大约一英里半的地方发现的另一个渡河口。等待我们的摆渡人归来的时候，我碰巧瞥见灌木丛下的一堆行李，并看到了那只臭鼬光溜溜的尸体。它被紧紧地捆扎着，将在晚上的篝火前被烤了吃。我无法抵制住将它扔入河里的欲望。不一会儿，我看着它像一块铅块那样沉入了河底。因此我们的小屋将免受这个美味佳肴所带来的刺鼻气味了。","It was now that our worthies, Beatte and Tonish, had an opportunity of displaying their Indian adroitness and resource.At the Osage village which we had passed a day or two before, they had procured a dry buffalo skin.This was now produced; cords were passed through a number of small eyelet-holes with which it was bordered, and it was drawn up, until it formed a kind of deep trough.Sticks were then placed athwart it on the inside, to keep it in shape; our camp equipage and a part of our baggage were placed within, and the singular bark was carried down the bank and set afloat.A cord was attached to the prow, which Beatte took between his teeth, and throwing himself into the water, went ahead, towing the bark after him; while Tonish followed behind, to keep it steady and to propel it.Part of the way they had foothold, and were enabled to wade, but in the main current they were obliged to swim.The whole way, they whooped and yelled in the Indian style, until they landed safely on the opposite shore.The Commissioner and myself were so well pleased with this Indian mode of ferriage, that we determined to trust ourselves in the buffalo hide.Our companions, the Count and Mr. L., had proceeded with the horses, along the river bank, in search of a ford which some of the rangers had discovered, about a mile and a half distant.While we were waiting for the return of our ferryman, I happened to cast my eyes upon a heap of luggage under a bush, and descried the sleek carcass of the polecat, snugly trussed up, and ready for roasting before the evening fire.I could not resist the temptation to plump it into the river, when it sunk to the bottom like a lump of lead; and thus our lodge was relieved from the bad odor which this savory viand had threatened to bring upon it."
"我们的摆渡人再次携着皮囊小船渡河。皮囊被拖上岸，里面马鞍、马褡裢和其他的行李占了一半的空间，得有百十来磅。当皮囊小船再次被放到水里之后，他们邀请我坐上去。这让我觉得自己很像愚人村里坐着碗出海的愚人。但我还是毫不犹豫而又小心翼翼地走上去了，然后坐在了行李上面。皮囊的边缘沉入水中大约一个巴掌的深度。之后，来复枪、猎枪和其他较小的东西都被递了过来，直到我抗议不能再拿任何东西为止。然后，我们便朝着溪流进发了，皮囊还是像从前那样被人牵着。","Our men having recrossed with their cockle-shell bark, it was drawn on shore, half filled with saddles, saddlebags, and other luggage, amounting to a hundred weight; and being again placed in the water, I was invited to take my seat.It appeared to me pretty much like the embarkation of the wise men of Gotham, who went to sea in a bowl: I stepped in, however, without hesitation, though as cautiously as possible, and sat down on the top of the luggage, the margin of the hide sinking to within a hand’s breadth of the water’s edge.Rifles, fowling-pieces, and other articles of small bulk, were then handed in, until I protested against receiving any more freight.We then launched forth upon the stream, the bark being towed as before."
"带着一种半认真、半滑稽的感觉，我发现自己是这样漂着的：坐在一张野牛皮上，处于一条被一片荒原包围着的、奔腾的河流中，被一个活像魔鬼化身的、一路高声吆喝的半野蛮人牵着。为了满足小托尼什的虚荣心，当到河中央时，我拔出双管枪向左右开火。射击声沿着岸边的树林不断回响，一些巡逻骑兵也高叫着作出回应，这让这个小法国人兴奋不已，他自己完全陶醉于这种印第安人渡河方式的自豪之中。","It was with a sensation half serious, half comic, that I found myself thus afloat, on the skin of a buffalo, in the midst of a wild river, surrounded by wilderness, and towed along by a half savage, whooping and yelling like a devil incarnate.To please the vanity of little Tonish, I discharged the double-barrelled gun, to the right and left, when in the centre of the stream.The report echoed along the woody shores, and was answered by shouts from some of the rangers, to the great exultation of the little Frenchman, who took to himself the whole glory of this Indian mode of navigation."
"我们的旅程愉快地完成了。专员也同样成功地过了河。我们所有的财物都是以相同的方式运过来的。任何人都不可能比小托尼什更能自吹自擂了，当他趾高气扬地在河岸周围逛游时，他兴高采烈地向那些巡逻骑兵们吹嘘他的高超技能和知识。然而，贝蒂则保持着他那骄傲阴郁的神色，不苟言笑。我们对巡逻骑兵们的无知极为蔑视，觉得他被他们小瞧了。他的唯一评论就是：“无论如何，他们现在知道印第安人不是平庸之辈了！”","Our voyage was accomplished happily; the Commissioner was ferried across with equal success, and all our effects were brought over in the same manner.Nothing could equal the vain-glorious vaporing of little Tonish, as he strutted about the shore, and exulted in his superior skill and knowledge, to the rangers.Beatte, however, kept his proud, saturnine look, without a smile.We had a vast contempt for the ignorance of the rangers, and felt that he had been undervalued by them.His only observation was, “Dey now see de Indian good for someting, anyhow!”"
"我们所登陆的这个宽阔河岸的沙地上，混杂着麋鹿、鹿、熊、浣熊、火鸡及水鸟的无数足迹。这个地方的景色美丽多姿：广阔的河面波光粼粼，河两边包围着垂柳和三角叶杨，河谷肥沃，树林茂盛，其中还高耸着巨大的悬铃树，远处环绕着被浓绿的植被所覆盖的岬角。树叶都泛着一种秋季的浅黄色，这给阳光明媚的大地抹上了一层克劳德·洛兰的风景画中所特有的金黄色色调。队长和他的主要同伴——医生正在用一条由原木和树枝扎成的筏子，运送物品渡河；大约一英里半远的地方，一长队的巡逻骑兵正沿着几个沙洲斜向策马渡河。这些都给这番景致增添了些许生气。","The broad, sandy shore where we had landed, was intersected by innumerable tracks of elk, deer, bears, racoons, turkeys, and water-fowl.The river scenery at this place was beautifully diversified, presenting long, shining reaches, bordered by willows and cottonwood trees; rich bottoms, with lofty, forests; among which towered enormous plane trees, and the distance was closed in by high embowered promontories.The foliage had a yellow autumnal tint, which gave to the sunny landscape the golden tone of one of the landscapes of Claude Lorraine.There was animation given to the scene, by a raft of logs and branches, on which the Captain and his prime companion, the Doctor, were ferrying their effects across the stream; and by a long line of rangers on horseback, fording the river obliquely, along a series of sand-bars, about a mile and a half distant."
"第十三章 峡谷的宿营","CHAPTER XIII. THE CAMP OF THE GLEN."
"营地谣言——波尼人及其习性——一位猎手的冒险找到马，但弄丢了人","CAMP GOSSIP.—PAWNEES AND THEIR HABITS.—A HUNTER’S ADVENTURE.HORSES FOUND, AND MEN LOST."
"和队长及一些巡逻骑兵汇合后，我们拐进了一个树林，走了大约半英里，然后来到了一个荒凉多石、两旁高耸着石灰石山崖的小山谷。越往里走，道路越狭窄，直到两边山崖交会，几乎形成了一个夹角。在这儿，清澈的泉水从岩石间涌出，并注入一条贯穿整个山谷的银色小溪，滋润着覆盖山谷的草地。","Being joined by the Captain and some of the rangers, we struck into the woods for about half a mile, and then entered a wild, rocky dell, bordered by two lofty ridges of limestone, which narrowed as we advanced, until they met and united; making almost an angle.Here a fine spring of water rose among the rocks, and fed a silver rill that ran the whole length of the dell, freshening the grass with which it was carpeted."
"我们便在这岩石的隐蔽之处、在高树之间安营扎寨。巡逻骑兵们有的独自行进，有的成群结队地穿过树林，都逐渐加入了我们。他们有的骑着马，有的步行，驱赶着身前驮着沉重行李的马匹。有的行李湿漉漉的，因为之前曾掉到了河里。之前那宽阔的河面和又深又急的水流让骑手们费劲周折、筋疲力尽。他们看上去简直就像是携带着赃物回来的强盗，而这个山谷恰似接应他们撤退的地方。夜幕降临之后，火光映照在这群人和马粗糙的脸上，更增强了这种效果。行李杂乱地堆在一起，步枪成堆地倚在树上，马鞍、缰绳、牛角制成的火药桶悬挂在树干上。","In this rocky nook we encamped, among tall trees.The rangers gradually joined us, straggling through the forest singly or in groups; some on horseback, some on foot, driving their horses before them, heavily laden with baggage, some dripping wet, having fallen into the river; for they had experienced much fatigue and trouble from the length of the ford, and the depth and rapidity of the stream.They looked not unlike banditti returning with their plunder, and the wild dell was a retreat worthy to receive them.The effect was heightened after dark, when the light of the fires was cast upon rugged looking groups of men and horses; with baggage tumbled in heaps, rifles piled against the trees, and saddles, bridles, and powder-horns hanging about their trunks."
"在营地里，我们与年轻的伯爵和他的同伴，以及那个年轻的混血儿安托万聚在了一起。他们都成功地渡过了河。然而，让我感到烦恼的是我发现我的两匹马都丢了。我本来是让安托万照看它们的，可是他天生是个粗心大意的人，根本没有好好留神它们。它们有可能在河对岸时就从队伍里走失了。我们安排贝蒂和安托万第二天一早重新渡河，去寻找它们。","At the encampment we were joined by the young Count and his companion, and the young half-breed, Antoine, who had all passed successfully by the ford.To my annoyance, however, I discovered that both of my horses were missing.I had supposed them in the charge of Antoine; but he, with characteristic carelessness, had paid no heed to them, and they had probably wandered from the line on the opposite side of the river.It was arranged that Beatte and Antoine should recross the river at an early hour of the morning, in search of them."
"一只肥硕的雄鹿，还有几只野火鸡被带进了营地，再加上一杯咖啡，我们设法做了一顿可口的晚餐。晚饭后，我又去了队长的屋子，那里是营地里的老猎手们商量事情和闲聊谈天的地方。","A fat buck, and a number of wild turkeys being brought into the camp, we managed, with the addition of a cup of coffee, to make a comfortable supper; after which I repaired to the Captain’s lodge, which was a kind of council fire and gossiping place for the veterans of the camp."
"当我们在一起聊天的时候，我们发现和前几个夜晚一样，一片暗红色的亮光照在林立于西方的悬崖之颠。这应该还是来自于大草原上印第安人的篝火，我们推测他们应该是在阿肯色河的西部。如果是这样的话，那篝火应该是一伙波尼人点的，因为奥塞奇猎手们很少到那个地方去冒险。然而，我们的混血儿却声称它们是奥塞奇人的篝火，他们就在阿肯色河的对岸。","As we were conversing together, we observed, as on former nights, a dusky, red glow in the west, above the summits of the surrounding cliffs.It was again attributed to Indian fires on the prairies; and supposed to be on the western side of the Arkansas.If so, it was thought they must be made by some party of Pawnees, as the Osage hunters seldom ventured in that quarter.Our half-breeds, however, pronounced them Osage fires; and that they were on the opposite side of the Arkansas."
"现在话题转到了波尼人身上，而我们也将进入他们的猎场了。这里总是存在一些野蛮而桀骜不驯的印第安部落。在一段时间内，他们成为边疆的恐怖之源，到处都流传着各种各样关于他们的可怕故事。目前，波尼人就是这样的一个部落。他们游荡在阿肯色河和雷德河之间的区域内，以及德克萨斯州的大草原上。他们被认为是极佳的骑兵，总是骑在大草原上原始种类强悍勇敢的战马背上。他们驰骋于一片片广阔的平原上，平原伸展在阿肯色河、雷德河周围，又穿越德克萨斯州，直到落基山脉脚下。他们有时候猎取鹿和野牛，有时候进行掠夺式的战事远征，因为就像他们的对手——以实玛利的子孙——一样，他们的手要攻打所有人，而所有人的手也要攻打他们。他们中的一些人没有固定居所，而是住在兽皮做的容易打包和运输的帐篷里，所以他们今天在这儿，然后离开，没有人知道他们明天会在哪儿。","The conversation now turned upon the Pawnees, into whose hunting grounds we were about entering.There is always some wild untamed tribe of Indians, who form, for a time, the terror of a frontier, and about whom all kinds of fearful stories are told.Such, at present, was the case with the Pawnees, who rove the regions between the Arkansas and the Red River, and the prairies of Texas.They were represented as admirable horsemen, and always on horseback; mounted on fleet and hardy steeds, the wild race of the prairies.With these they roam the great plains that extend about the Arkansas, the Red River, and through Texas, to the Rocky Mountains; sometimes engaged in hunting the deer and buffalo, sometimes in warlike and predatory expeditions; for, like their counterparts, the sons of Ishmael, their hand is against every one, and every one’s hand against them.Some of them have no fixed habitation, but dwell in tents of skin, easily packed up and transported, so that they are here to-day, and away, no one knows where, to-morrow."
"一个经验丰富的猎手讲述了几件关于他们作战方法的轶事。根据他所说的，在大草原之中，如果一队疲惫的商人或猎手被他们发现了，那将是一件很不幸的事。有时，他们会使用计谋偷偷接近目标：他们把一条腿搭在马鞍上，把身子藏起来。这样，在远处看来他们的队伍就像是一队野马。当他们因此而离敌人足够近时，就会突然在马鞍上直起身子，像一阵暴风似的迅疾地刮向敌人。所有人头上的羽毛都迎风飘扬，他们抖动着身上的披风，挥舞着手中的武器，并发出骇人的叫喊。他们试图以这种方式引起马群的恐慌，让它们仓皇而逃，然后他们再去追赶它们并将它们成功带回。","One of the veteran hunters gave several anecdotes of their mode of fighting.Luckless, according to his account, is the band of weary traders or hunters descried by them, in the midst of a prairie.Sometimes, they will steal upon them by stratagem, hanging with one leg over the saddle, and their bodies concealed; so that their troop at a distance has the appearance of a gang of wild horses.When they have thus gained sufficiently upon the enemy, they will suddenly raise themselves in their saddles, and come like a rushing blast, all fluttering with feathers, shaking their mantles, brandishing their weapons, and making hideous yells.In this way, they seek to strike a panic into the horses, and put them to the scamper, when they will pursue and carry them off in triumph."
"根据这个经验丰富的林中人所说，最好的防御方式是隐蔽到一些树林或灌木林中；如果当时什么也没有的话，就下马，并把马围成一个圈，马头挨马头地拴紧，这样它们便不会四散逃离了，然后撤退到某个峡谷，以此作为屏障，或者就地挖个沙坑。在那儿，他们或许就能躲开波尼人的长矛。波尼人主要用弓和箭，还都是些箭法娴熟的弓箭手。他们喜欢围着敌人不停地转圈，并且在马全速奔跑时开弓放箭。他们在大草原上非常有威慑力，因为在那儿，他们的马可以自由驰骋，也没有树会抵挡他们的箭。他们很少跟随着一个飞奔的敌人进入森林。","The best mode of defence, according to this veteran woodsman, is to get into the covert of some wood, or thicket; or if there be none at hand, to dismount, tie the horses firmly head to head in a circle, so that they cannot break away and scatter, and resort to the shelter of a ravine, or make a hollow in the sand, where they may be screened from the shafts of the Pawnees.The latter chiefly use the bow and arrow, and are dexterous archers; circling round and round their enemy, and launching their arrows when at full speed.They are chiefly formidable on the prairies, where they have free career for their horses, and no trees to turn aside their arrows.They will rarely follow a flying enemy into the forest."
"同时，几件轶事也讲述了他们行事之神秘和谨慎，比如他们会偷偷包围营地，等待劫掠或攻击的最佳时机。","Several anecdotes, also, were given, of the secrecy and caution with which they will follow, and hang about the camp of an enemy, seeking a favorable moment for plunder or attack."
"“我们从现在开始必须时刻保持警惕，”队长说，“我必须发布书面命令：任何人不经允许不得去打猎或者开枪，否则将受到骑马背带有尖刺的木马的惩罚。”我有一群自由散漫的年轻手下，他们还不习惯边疆的生活方式。教会他们提高警惕是很困难的。我们现在处于一个满是沉默、警觉而又诡计多端的人的土地上。在我们没有丝毫怀疑之时，他们也许已经包围了我们，秘密监视我们的一举一动，并准备袭击所有的落伍者。","“We must now begin to keep a sharp look-out,” said the Captain.“I must issue written orders, that no man shall hunt without leave, or fire off a gun, on pain of riding a wooden horse with a sharp back.""I have a wild crew of young fellows, unaccustomed to frontier service.It will be difficult to teach them caution.We are now in the land of a silent, watchful, crafty people, who, when we least suspect it, may be around us, spying out all our movements, and ready to pounce upon all stragglers."
"“那如果你的人在营地周围巡逻时发现了猎物，你将如何禁止他们开枪呢？”一个巡逻骑兵问道。","“How will you be able to keep your men from firing, if they see game while strolling round the camp?” asked one of the rangers."
"“除非是在执勤或者有我的许可，否则他们不可以随身携带枪支。”","“They must not take their guns with them unless they are on duty, or have permission.”"
"“哎呀，队长！”这个巡逻骑兵惊呼道，“这对我可不适用。无论我去哪儿，我的步枪就跟到那儿。我从来没想过要离开它，它就像我自己的一部分一样。没有人能像我一样这么仔细地照看它，也没有什么东西能像我的步枪一样这么认真地照顾我。”","“Ah, Captain!” cried the ranger, “that will never do for me.”Where I go, my rifle goes.I never like to leave it behind; it’s like a part of myself.There’s no one will take such care of it as I, and there’s nothing will take such care of me as my rifle."
"“那确实是事实。”队长说。一个真正猎手的真挚感情深深触动了他。“每晚我的步枪就像我老婆那样一直陪在我身边，它还一直是我忠实的朋友。”","“There’s truth in all that,” said the Captain, touched by a true hunter’s sympathy.“I’ve had my rifle pretty nigh as long as I have had my wife, and a faithful friend it has been to me.”"
"此时，那个和队长一样热衷于打猎的医生插话道：“我的一个邻居说，相比之下，我宁愿把老婆借给你，而不是我的步枪。”","Here the Doctor, who is as keen a hunter as the Captain, joined in the conversation: “A neighbor of mine says, next to my rifle, I’d as leave lend you my wife.”"
"“很少有人，”队长评论道，“对他们步枪的照看能达到它们应该被照看的程度。”","“There’s few,” observed the Captain, “that take care of their rifles as they ought to be taken care of.”"
"“对他们的妻子也是如此。”医生狡黠地眨着眼睛回答道。","“Or of their wives either,” replied the Doctor, with a wink."
"“那是事实。”队长附和道。","“That’s a fact,” rejoined the Captain."
"此时，消息传来：由“老瑞安”带领的四个巡逻骑兵失踪了。他们在河对岸寻找渡河点时和大部队分散了，然后便掉了队，没人知道他们去了哪里。人们对他们进行了诸般猜测，也有人对他们的安全表示担忧。","Word was now brought that a party of four rangers, headed by “Old Ryan,” were missing.They had separated from the main body, on the opposite side of the river, when searching for a ford, and had straggled off, nobody knew whither.Many conjectures were made about them, and some apprehensions expressed for their safety."
"“我应该派人去找他们，”队长说，“不过老瑞安和他们一起，他知道如何照顾自己和其他人。如果不是因为有他，我就不能分心照顾其他那么多人了。他在树林里或者大草原上，就像在自己的农家庭院一样自由自在。无论他在哪儿，他都不会走失的。他们有足够的人手来互相照应：四个人警戒，一个人负责生火。”","“I should send to look after them,” said the Captain, “but old Ryan is with them, and he knows how to take care of himself and of them too.”If it were not for him, I would not give much for the rest; but he is as much at home in the woods or on a prairie as he would be in his own farmyard.He’s never lost, wherever he is.There’s a good gang of them to stand by one another; four to watch and one to take care of the fire."
"“晚上迷失在陌生而又荒凉的乡间是件可悲的事情。”一个年轻的巡逻骑兵说道。","“It’s a dismal thing to get lost at night in a strange and wild country,” said one of the younger rangers."
"“可如果你有一两个人做伴儿的话就没事。”一个年纪大些的说道。“对我而言，如果有一个伙伴可以和我轮流警戒，轮流照看篝火，那么我在这个山谷里就和在家里一样高兴。我可以在这儿躺上几个小时，凝望那颗闪闪发光的星星，而它好像也俯视着营地，似乎是在守卫营地一样。","“Not if you have one or two in company,” said an elder one.“For my part, I could feel as cheerful in this hollow as in my own home, if I had but one comrade to take turns to watch and keep the fire going.”I could lie here for hours, and gaze up to that blazing star there, that seems to look down into the camp as if it were keeping guard over it."
"没错，当你不得不独自警戒时，那些星星们就像是一个伙伴。那颗星星还真有些令人感到愉快，我想它就是昏星，他们称之为金星的那颗。”","“Aye, the stars are a kind of company to one, when you have to keep watch alone.”That’s a cheerful star, too, somehow; that’s the evening star, the planet Venus they call it, I think."
"“如果那颗星星是金星的话，”一个之前一起开会的人说道，“那它对我们来说可不是个好兆头。因为我记得在某本书上读到过，说波尼人崇拜那颗星星，并把他们的俘虏献祭给它。所以我觉得，在这地方还是不要看到那颗星星为妙。”我想，他就是那个唱圣歌的校长。","“If that’s the planet Venus,” said one of the council, who, I believe, was the psalm-singing schoolmaster, “it bodes us no good; for I recollect reading in some book that the Pawnees worship that star, and sacrifice their prisoners to it.”So I should not feel the better for the sight of that star in this part of the country."
"“啊，”那个中士，也是个训练有素的山林人说道，“不管有没有星星，我都在一个比这儿更荒凉的地方独自呆了好几个晚上，并且我向你保证，我都睡得很香。”“可是，有一次我确实过得很不安。我在穿越汤比格比河附近的一片树林时耽搁了，于是我擦着了火柴，生了一堆火。我睡觉时把马给松开了。不久之后，我听到了狼嚎声。我的马非常害怕，一个劲儿地往我身边挤来，以寻求保护。我把它赶走，但它又返了回来，并且靠得越来越近。它站在那儿看着我和火堆，头不时地往下垂，直打瞌睡，并且前蹄一直晃晃悠悠的，因为它实在是累坏了。又过了一会儿，我听到一声奇怪的凄凉的叫声。起初，我以为那可能是一头猫头鹰。接着我又听到一声，然后便知道了那不是猫头鹰，而是一头美洲豹。我感到很棘手，因为除了一把双刃小折刀，我没有其他的武器。然而，我还是尽最大可能做好防御准备：我把烧焦的小木头堆在一起，万一它接近，就向它投掷。此刻，我的马的陪伴似乎给了我很大的安慰，这可怜的畜生趴在我身边，因为太累了，它很快就睡着了。我继续警戒，不停地垂下脑袋打瞌睡，然后又猛然惊醒，并环顾四周，希望看到美洲豹那双闪闪发光的眼睛向我逼近。但是，不知怎地，疲劳还是压倒了我，于是我便沉沉地睡去了。早上，我在不到六十步的地方发现了美洲豹的足迹。它的爪印有我的两个拳头那么大。很明显，它来来回回地走了好几遍，犹豫着是否要攻击我。幸运的是，它没有这个勇气。”","“Well,” said the sergeant, a thorough-bred woodsman, “star or no star, I have passed many a night alone in a wilder place than this, and slept sound too, I’ll warrant you.”Once, however, I had rather an uneasy time of it.I was belated in passing through a tract of wood, near the Tombigbee River; so I struck a light, made a fire, and turned my horse loose, while I stretched myself to sleep.By and by, I heard the wolves howl.My horse came crowding near me for protection, for he was terribly frightened.I drove him off, but he returned, and drew nearer and nearer, and stood looking at me and at the fire, and dozing, and nodding, and tottering on his fore feet, for he was powerful tired.After a while, I heard a strange dismal cry.I thought at first it might be an owl.I heard it again, and then I knew it was not an owl, but must be a panther.I felt rather awkward, for I had no weapon but a double-bladed penknife.I however prepared for defence in the best way I could, and piled up small brands from the fire, to pepper him with, should he come nigh.The company of my horse now seemed a comfort to me; the poor creature laid down beside me and soon fell asleep, being so tired.I kept watch, and nodded and dozed, and started awake, and looked round, expecting to see the glaring eyes of the panther close upon me; but somehow or other, fatigue got the better of me, and I fell asleep outright.In the morning I found the tracks of a panther within sixty paces.They were as large as my two fists.He had evidently been walking backward and forward, trying to make up his mind to attack me; but luckily, he had not courage."
"40832.0——我拂晓前便醒了。月光从轻盈飘逸的云朵间泻入幽谷。篝火几乎燃尽了，人们裹着毯子，躺在它们周围。伴随着天边的第一抹亮光，我们的猎手贝蒂和年轻的混血儿安托万再次动身，渡河去寻找走失的马匹，几个将步枪落在河对岸的巡逻骑兵也和他们同行。由于河水很深，而且他们必须沿着对角线来顶着湍急的水流过河，所以他们不得不骑着最高大最强壮的马。","October 16th.—I awoke before daylight.The moon was shining feebly down into the glen, from among light drifting clouds; the camp fires were nearly burnt out, and the men lying about them, wrapped in blankets.With the first streak of day, our huntsman, Beatte, with Antoine, the young half-breed, set off to recross the river, in search of the stray horses, in company with several rangers who had left their rifles on the opposite shore.As the ford was deep, and they were obliged to cross in a diagonal line, against a rapid current, they had to be mounted on the tallest and strongest horses."
"到八点时，贝蒂回来了。他找到了马儿们，但是却把安托万给弄丢了。他说，安托万就是个孩子，是一个毫无经验、对森林一无所知的人。他走出了他的视线，然后就失踪了。可是，有许多人可以与他作伴，因为还有几个巡逻骑兵也走失了，并且老瑞安和他的那伙人也没有回来。","By eight o’clock, Beatte returned.He had found the horses, but had lost Antoine.The latter, he said, was a boy, a greenhorn, that knew nothing of the woods.He had wandered out of sight of him, and got lost.However, there were plenty more for him to fall in company with, as some of the rangers had gone astray also, and old Ryan and his party had not returned."
"我们一直等到第二天早上，希望落伍者们重新归队，但是他们并没有出现。队长总结说，对岸的印第安人对白人很友好，所以不必过于担心失踪者的安全。最大的危险是，他们的马也许会被掉队的奥塞奇人在夜间偷走了。因此，他决定继续前进，只是在营地留下一些殿后的人，等待他们回来。","We waited until the morning was somewhat advanced, in hopes of being rejoined by the stragglers, but they did not make their appearance.The Captain observed, that the Indians on the opposite side of the river, were all well disposed to the whites; so that no serious apprehensions need be entertained for the safety of the missing.The greatest danger was, that their horses might be stolen in the night by straggling Osages.He determined, therefore, to proceed, leaving a rear guard in the camp, to await their arrival."
"我坐在山谷上部溪水中一块凸起的岩石上，自娱自乐地看着眼前水流变幻的景象。首先，为出发作准备。马儿们从营地周围被赶了回来，巡逻骑兵们策马奔走在岩石和灌木之间，寻找其他失散到远处的马匹。人们匆忙地收拾着野营装备。水壶和平底锅从一群人手里传到另一群人手里时的吆喝声，人们对倔强难驯的马匹的呵斥声，以及对那些已经装上行李，兀自跑到一边嚼草的马匹的高声咒骂声混合成了一片。而在这一片乱哄哄的声音当中，我们的小个子法国人托尼什的声音格外清晰。","I sat on a rock that overhung the spring at the upper part of the dell, and amused myself by watching the changing scene before me.First, the preparations for departure.Horses driven in from the purlieus of the camp; rangers riding about among rocks and bushes in quest of others that had strayed to a distance; the bustle of packing up camp equipage, and the clamor after kettles and frying-pans borrowed by one mess from another, mixed up with oaths and exclamations at restive horses, or others that had wandered away to graze after being packed, among which the voice of our little Frenchman, Tonish, was particularly to be distinguished."
"号声响起，预示着该上马出发了。整个队伍排成不规则的一列沿着山谷向下前进，穿过广阔的森林，一路曲曲折折，渐渐消失在丛林之间，可是人们的叫嚷声和号角声仍不时地从后方传来。殿后者仍待在山谷下半部分的树下。有的骑在马上，肩上扛着步枪；其他的则坐在火堆旁或者躺在地上，用低低的、懒洋洋的声音闲聊着。他们的马没有上鞍，在周围站着打盹。而其中一个充分利用这段休闲时间的巡逻骑兵，正在一个放在树干上的小镜子前刮着胡子。","The bugle sounded the signal to mount and march.The troop filed off in irregular line down the glen, and through the open forest, winding and gradually disappearing among the trees, though the clamor of voices and the notes of the bugle could be heard for some time afterward.The rear-guard remained under the trees in the lower part of the dell, some on horseback, with their rifles on their shoulders; others seated by the fire or lying on the ground, gossiping in a low, lazy tone of voice, their horses unsaddled, standing and dozing around, while one of the rangers, profiting by this interval of leizure, was shaving himself before a pocket mirror stuck against the trunk of a tree."
"远处的喧闹声和号角声渐渐消失了，山谷恢复了往日的寂静，只是偶尔被火堆旁人们的窃窃低语声，或树林间某个人沉重的口哨声，或秋叶的瑟瑟声所划破。最轻微的一阵风都能把秋叶从树枝上刮落，在空中雪花般盘旋飞舞，预示着一年荣耀的结束。","The clamor of voices and the notes of the bugle at length died away, and the glen relapsed into quiet and silence, broken occasionally by the low murmuring tone of the group around the fire, or the pensive whistle of some laggard among the trees; or the rustling of the yellow leaves, which the lightest breath of air brought down in wavering showers, a sign of the departing glories of the year."

"穿过河边林地的外围之后，我们开始爬山，经过一片高低起伏的橡树林间的空地，踏上了一条向西的路。在那儿放眼望去，四周尽是被大大小小的树林和树丛所覆盖的山峦和峡谷。当我们缓慢前进的时候，队伍前边的人发现在大约半英里远的一个绿色山坡上，有四头鹿在吃草。显然，它们没有发现我们的到来，继续非常安静地吃着草。一个年轻的巡逻骑兵从队长那儿得到许可去猎取它们，于是整个队伍长长地排成一排停下，静静地看着他。他缓慢而又小心翼翼地驱动着坐骑，绕了个圈，走到了一片挡在他和鹿之间的树林里。然后他下了马，把马留在树林中，绕着一个土墩爬了过去，从我们的视线里消失了。我们现在紧紧地盯着鹿，它们仍然在吃草，完全没有意识到危险正悄悄临近。很快，传来了一声尖锐的来复枪声。一头硕大的雄鹿猛然跳起，然后倒在了地上；它的同伴们都四散逃跑了。我们整个队伍马上便一哄而散了。队伍中的年轻人急不可待地飞奔出去，渴望能够射杀逃亡的鹿。而追逐的人群中最惹人注目的人物，就是我们那位骑着银灰色马的小个子法国人托尼什。他一看见鹿，就把他的驮马们撇到一边了。号角声响过很长时间之后，我们四散的队伍才重新聚齐，继续我们的旅程。","Having passed through the skirt of woodland bordering the river, we ascended the hills, taking a westerly course through an undulating country of “oak openings,” where the eye stretched over wide tracts of hill and dale, diversified by forests, groves, and clumps of trees.As we were proceeding at a slow pace, those who were at the head of the line descried four deer grazing on a grassy slope about half a mile distant.They apparently had not perceived our approach, and continued to graze in perfect tranquillity.A young ranger obtained permission from the Captain to go in pursuit of them, and the troop halted in lengthened line, watching him in silence.Walking his horse slowly and cautiously, he made a circuit until a screen of wood intervened between him and the deer.Dismounting then, he left his horse among the trees, and creeping round a knoll, was hidden from our view.We now kept our eyes intently fixed on the deer, which continued grazing, unconscious of their danger.Presently there was the sharp report of a rifle; a fine buck made a convulsive bound and fell to the earth; his companions scampered off.Immediately our whole line of march was broken; there was a helter-skelter galloping of the youngsters of the troop, eager to get a shot at the fugitives; and one of the most conspicuous personages in the chase was our little Frenchman Tonish, on his silver-gray; having abandoned his pack-horses at the first sight of the deer.It was some time before our scattered forces could be recalled by the bugle, and our march resumed."
"那天的行程中，我们有两三次被这种匆忙的追逐打断。队伍中的年轻人为进入这片猎物丰富的未开发地区而兴奋不已。他们还都不习惯遵守纪律、约束或秩序。可是，没有一个人比托尼什更难管。由于对自己的狩猎技巧感到强烈自负，并且对自我炫耀有着一种无法抑制的激情，所以一旦有猎物被惊动跑了出来，他就总是会像一只不安分的猎犬那样飞奔过去，然后又常常被狠狠地呵斥住。","Two or three times in the course of the day we were interrupted by hurry-scurry scenes of the kind.The young men of the troop were full of excitement on entering an unexplored country abounding in game, and they were too little accustomed to discipline or restraint to be kept in order.No one, however, was more unmanageable than Tonish.Having an intense conceit of his skill as a hunter, and an irrepressible passion for display, he was continually sallying forth, like an ill-broken hound, whenever any game was started, and had as often to be whipped back."
"最终，他的好奇心得到了有力的抑制。一头肥壮的母鹿连蹦带跳地跑了过来，整支队伍都能看到它。托尼什下了马，端起他的步枪，射了非常棒的一枪。那头母鹿继续跳着。他跳上了马，像个杂技演员那样站在马鞍上，继续紧盯着猎物，好像肯定会看到它倒下。然而，那头母鹿一路高高兴兴地奔了下去。队伍里爆发出一阵哄堂大笑，小个子法国人灰溜溜地坐到马鞍上，开始骂骂咧咧地呵斥那些步履沉重的驮马，似乎它们才是罪魁祸首。于是，一段时间内，我们不再受他那聒噪不休的自吹自擂的折磨了。","At length his curiosity got a salutary check.A fat doe came bounding along in full view of the whole line.Tonish dismounted, levelled his rifle, and had a fair shot.The doe kept on.He sprang upon his horse, stood up on the saddle like a posture-master, and continued gazing after the animal as if certain to see it fall.The doe, however, kept on its way rejoicing; a laugh broke out along the line, the little Frenchman slipped quietly into his saddle, began to belabor and blaspheme the wandering pack-horses, as if they had been to blame, and for some time we were relieved from his vaunting and vaporing."
"行军过程中，我们来到了一个残留的印第安人的旧营地。这个旧营地位于一条美丽溪流的岸边，长满苔藓的地上到处是鹿留下的脚印。由于我们正处在波尼人的领地上，所以我们理所当然地认为这曾是那些可怕的游牧者的营地。但是，仔细观察过这些屋子的形状和分布之后，医生说这可能是一些勇敢的德拉瓦尔人在一次短暂的冒险中进入这片狩猎场时留下的营地。","In one place of our march we came to the remains of an old Indian encampment, on the banks of a fine stream, with the moss-grown sculls of deer lying here and there about it.As we were in the Pawnee country, it was supposed, of course, to have been a camp of those formidable rovers; the Doctor, however, after considering the shape and disposition of the lodges, pronounced it the camp of some bold Delawares, who had probably made a brief and dashing excursion into these dangerous hunting grounds."
"又前进了一段距离之后，我们发现了两英里远的地方有两个骑在马背上的人，他们正沿着一座光秃秃的山丘的边缘和我们平行前进。显然，他们在侦察我们。部队停了下来，盯着他们并不断猜测着。他们是印第安人吗？如果是印第安人，那他们是波尼人吗？在这些充满敌意的平原上行走时，看到远方地平线上巡行的骑手，是一件能激发各种想象和让人躁动不安的事。这就像是战争时，在海上看到一艘帆船，那有可能是一艘私掠船或海盗船。通过一架小型望远镜侦察了那两个骑手之后，我们的猜疑就很快消除了，因为我们发现，原来他们是我们之前留在营地里的两个人。他们是来和我们汇合的，只是走错了路。","Having proceeded some distance farther, we observed a couple of figures on horseback, slowly moving parallel to us along the edge of a naked hill about two miles distant; and apparently reconnoitring us.There was a halt, and much gazing and conjecturing.Were they Indians?If Indians, were they Pawnees?There is something exciting to the imagination and stirring to the feelings, while traversing these hostile plains, in seeing a horseman prowling along the horizon.It is like descrying a sail at sea in time of war, when it may be either a privateer or a pirate.Our conjectures were soon set at rest by reconnoitring the two horsemen through a small spyglass, when they proved to be two of the men we had left at the camp, who had set out to rejoin us, and had wandered from the track."
"我们今天的行军活力无限，令人愉快。我们正处于一个充满危险的地区，正费力地穿越一片到目前为止除了可能有某个设阱捕兽者之外，没有一个白人踏足过的土地。今天天气非常好，温和宜人，令人愉快。湛蓝的天空中飘着几朵羽毛般轻盈的白云；空气几乎完全透明，纯净而又柔和；美丽的大地一望无际，正沐浴在秋日金黄的阳光下。但是，一切都是那么寂静，毫无生气，荒无人烟。显然，没有人住在这里！好像有一道禁令高悬在这片美丽而又命运多舛的地区之上。那些印第安人也不敢住在这里，只是把它当作一个冒险之地，打几天猎，然后离开。","Our march this day was animating and delightful.We were in a region of adventure; breaking our way through a country hitherto untrodden by white men, excepting perchance by some solitary trapper.The weather was in its perfection, temperate, genial and enlivening; a deep blue sky with a few light feathery clouds, an atmosphere of perfect transparency, an air pure and bland, and a glorious country spreading out far and wide in the golden sunshine of an autumnal day; but all silent, lifeless, without a human habitation, and apparently without a human inhabitant!It was as if a ban hung over this fair but fated region.The very Indians dared not abide here, but made it a mere scene of perilous enterprise, to hunt for a few days, and then away."
"大约向西走了十五英里之后，我们在一个美丽的半岛上驻扎下来。这个半岛是由一条蜿蜒的小溪围成的，溪水很深，很清澈，几乎凝滞不动。半岛被一个壮观的小树林所覆盖，里面的树木高耸挺拔。几个猎手马上在营地里的喧闹声把周围的猎物吓跑之前，出去寻找猎物了。我们的贝蒂也拿上来复枪独自出发了，踏上了和其他人不同方向的道路。","After a march of about fifteen miles west we encamped in a beautiful peninsula, made by the windings and doublings of a deep, clear, and almost motionless brook, and covered by an open grove of lofty and magnificent trees.Several hunters immediately started forth in quest of game before the noise of the camp should frighten it from the vicinity.Our man, Beatte, also took his rifle and went forth alone, in a different course from the rest."
"而我则躺在树下的草地上望着云朵遐想，尽情享受着这乡间的宁静。真的，我很难想象还有别的一种生活更能有意识地让身心达到如此健康的状态。上午几个小时的骑马行军中穿插着好几次的临时打猎；下午则在一条小溪边上壮观的小树林里宿营；晚上举行鹿肉会餐，把刚杀的鹿架在火炭上烤着吃；还有刚从灌木丛里打来的火鸡和在树上采集的野蜂蜜，所有这些都是城里的美食家们所无法想象的。而在深夜，或者是美美地睡在旷野之中，或者是凝望着闪烁在树木之间的月亮和星星。","For my own part, I lay on the grass under the trees, and built castles in the clouds, and indulged in the very luxury of rural repose.Indeed I can scarcely conceive a kind of life more calculated to put both mind and body in a healthful tone.A morning’s ride of several hours diversified by hunting incidents; an encampment in the afternoon under some noble grove on the borders of a stream; an evening banquet of venison, fresh killed, roasted, or broiled on the coals; turkeys just from the thickets and wild honey from the trees; and all relished with an appetite unknown to the gourmets of the cities.And at night—such sweet sleeping in the open air, or waking and gazing at the moon and stars, shining between the trees!"
"然而，在目前的情况下，我们没有多少理由夸耀自己的食物。白天只猎杀了一头鹿，而我们这一屋并没有分到鹿肉。因此，我们不得不用从上一个营地带来的些许残留的火鸡，加上一两片咸猪肉来填补我们强烈的食欲。然而，这种食物匮乏的情形并没有持续太长的时间。天黑前，一个年轻的猎手满载着猎物回来了。他射杀了一头鹿，然后以一种颇为艺术的方式把它肢解，接着把肉放到一个兽皮制的袋子里，斜挎在肩上，脚步沉重地把它背回了营地。","On the present occasion, however, we had not much reason to boast of our larder.But one deer had been killed during the day, and none of that had reached our lodge.We were fain, therefore, to stay our keen appetites by some scrape of turkey brought from the last encampment, eked out with a slice or two of salt pork.This scarcity, however, did not continue long.Before dark a young hunter returned well laden with spoil.He had shot a deer, cut it up in an artist-like style, and, putting the meat in a kind of sack made of the hide, had slung it across his shoulder and trudged with it to camp."
"之后不久，贝蒂也出现了，马背上放着一头肥壮的母鹿。这是他带回来的第一个猎物，我很高兴看到他带回来了一个或许可以抹去大家关于臭鼬的记忆的战利品。他一言不发地把猎物放在我们的篝火旁，然后转身去卸马鞍。他简洁地回答了我们关于他打猎的所有问题。然而，如果说贝蒂对他所做过的事遵从着这种印第安人沉默寡言的性情，那么托尼什则通过自吹自擂他想要干什么对此作了补充。既然我们现在在一个很好的猎场里，那他就打算好好利用这块土地。如果我们采纳他的建议，那么从今往后，我们的屋子里将满是猎物。值得庆幸的是，他的夸夸其谈并没有妨碍他工作。这头母鹿被熟练地分割开来，几块肥胖的肋骨被放在火前烤着，咖啡壶也再次被灌满。一小会儿之后，我们便可以奢侈地补偿我们之前匮乏的晚餐了。","Not long after, Beatte made his appearance with a fat doe across his horse.It was the first game he had brought in, and I was glad to see him with a trophy that might efface the memory of the polecat.He laid the carcass down by our fire without saying a word, and then turned to unsaddle his horse; nor could any questions from us about his hunting draw from him more than laconic replies.If Beatte, however, observed this Indian taciturnity about what he had done, Tonish made up for it by boasting of what he meant to do.Now that we were in a good hunting country he meant to take the field, and, if we would take his word for it, our lodge would henceforth be overwhelmed with game.Luckily his talking did not prevent his working, the doe was skilfully dissected, several fat ribs roasted before the fire, the coffee kettle replenished, and in a little while we were enabled to indemnify ourselves luxuriously for our late meagre repast."
"队长到很晚才回来，而且两手空空。当他正在追逐他通常的猎物——鹿时，发现了一处大约有六十头麋鹿的鹿群的脚印。他从未猎杀过这种动物，然而猎杀麋鹿是营地里所有的老猎手所向往的目标。于是，他放弃了对鹿的追逐，而沿着新发现的脚印追踪下去。一段时间之后，他看到了麋鹿，并有好几次开枪射击的机会，但是他却急于打倒跑在前面的一头大雄鹿。最终因发现整个鹿群都有逃脱的危险，他便向一头母鹿开了火。子弹打中了目标，不过那个动物还有足够的力气继续和它的同伴们一起跑一阵子。通过血迹，他断定它受到了致命的一伤，但是夜幕降临，他没法再继续追逐了，于是只能放弃搜索，等待天亮。","The Captain did not return until late, and he returned empty-handed.He had been in pursuit of his usual game, the deer, when he came upon the tracks of a gang of about sixty elk.Having never killed an animal of the kind, and the elk being at this moment an object of ambition among all the veteran hunters of the camp, he abandoned his pursuit of the deer, and followed the newly discovered track.After some time he came in sight of the elk, and had several fair chances of a shot, but was anxious to bring down a large buck which kept in the advance.Finding at length there was danger of the whole gang escaping him, he fired at a doe.The shot took effect, but the animal had sufficient strength to keep on for a time with its companions.From the tracks of blood he felt confident it was mortally wounded, but evening came on, he could not keep the trail, and had to give up the search until morning."
"老瑞安和他的小分队还是没有和我们汇合，我们年轻的混血儿安托万也没有露面。因此，我们决定第二天继续呆在营地里，从而给所有的落伍者充足的时间到达。","Old Ryan and his little band had not yet rejoined us, neither had our young half-breed Antoine made his appearance.It was determined, therefore, to remain at our encampment for the following day, to give time for all stragglers to arrive."
"这天晚上，老猎手们的谈话转向了德拉瓦尔人部落。在我们今天的行进过程中，曾经路过他们的一个营地。猎手们讲述了关于他们强大的战斗力和灵巧的狩猎技能的一些轶事。他们过去是奥塞奇人的死敌。虽然奥塞奇人倾向于把他们的勇猛无畏归结于一种古怪的原因，但却很敬畏他们这一点。“看看那些德拉瓦尔人，”他们会说，“腿那么短，根本跑不起来，他们必须站在那儿格斗。”实际上，德拉瓦尔人的腿确实有些短，而奥塞奇人的特点则是四肢修长。","The conversation this evening, among the old huntsmen, turned upon the Delaware tribe, one of whose encampments we had passed in the course of the day; and anecdotes were given of their prowess in war and dexterity in hunting.They used to be deadly foes of the Osages, who stood in great awe of their desperate valor, though they were apt to attribute it to a whimsical cause.“Look at the Delawares,” would they say, “dey got short leg—no can run—must stand and fight a great heap.”In fact the Delawares are rather short legged, while the Osages are remarkable for length of limb."
"无论是战争还是狩猎，德拉瓦尔人的征程总是范围很广而又无所畏惧。他们一小队人也敢深入到那些危险而又充满敌意的旷野，甚至还把他们的营地扎到落基山脉中。这种勇敢的性情，也许是在一定程度上受到了他们的一条迷信的信条的鼓励。他们相信有一种形如巨鹰的保护神，会在他们视线所不及的高空中盘旋，并俯视着他们。有时，当神灵为他们感到高兴时，他便飞到较低的区域，这时便有可能看见他伸展着巨大的翅膀盘旋于白云之间。此时，这个季节就是吉利的：谷物长势良好，他们打猎时也会取得更大的成功。然而，有时他也会生气，继而把怒气通过他的声音——雷发泄出来，或者眨动眼睛，制造闪电，杀死他不喜欢的事物。","The expeditions of the Delawares, whether of war or hunting, are wide and fearless; a small band of them will penetrate far into these dangerous and hostile wilds, and will push their encampments even to the Rocky Mountains.This daring temper may be in some measure encouraged by one of the superstitions of their creed.They believe that a guardian spirit, in the form of a great eagle, watches over them, hovering in the sky, far out of sight.Sometimes, when well pleased with them, he wheels down into the lower regions, and may be seen circling with widespread wings against the white clouds; at such times the seasons are propitious, the corn grows finely, and they have great success in hunting.Sometimes, however, he is angry, and then he vents his rage in the thunder, which is his voice, and the lightning, which is the flashing of his eye, and strikes dead the object of his displeasure."
"德拉瓦尔人会向这个神灵献祭，而他则会偶尔落下翅膀上的一根羽毛以示满意。这些羽毛能让佩戴者隐身，不受伤害。实际上，印第安人通常认为鹰的羽毛拥有神秘而又至高无上的美德。","The Delawares make sacrifices to this spirit, who occasionally lets drop a feather from his wing in token of satisfaction.These feathers render the wearer invisible, and invulnerable.Indeed, the Indians generally consider the feathers of the eagle possessed of occult and sovereign virtues."
"有一次，一群德拉瓦尔人进入波尼人猎场进行勇敢的远足，却被包围在一块大平原上，几乎全军覆没。残余的人马躲避在一个孤零零的圆锥形小山的顶部，这小山处在大草原的中间，看起来几乎像是人工堆砌起来的。在这儿，为首的战士几乎被逼无望，于是他杀了他的马献祭给保护神。突然，一只巨鹰从天空中俯冲下来，用它的爪子抓起祭品，并又爬升到了空中，然后从它的翅膀上抖落下一根大羽毛。这个首领高兴地抓着它，把它固定在前额上。然后领着手下奔下山丘，从敌人中间杀出一条血路，所有人都毫发无损。","At one time a party of the Delawares, in the course of a bold excursion into the Pawnee hunting grounds, were surrounded on one of the great plains, and nearly destroyed.The remnant took refuge on the summit of one of those isolated and conical hills which rise almost like artificial mounds, from the midst of the prairies.Here the chief warrior, driven almost to despair, sacrificed his horse to the tutelar spirit.Suddenly an enormous eagle, rushing down from the sky, bore off the victim in his talons, and mounting into the air, dropped a quill feather from his wing.The chief caught it up with joy, bound it to his forehead, and, leading his followers down the hill, cut his way through the enemy with great slaughter, and without any one of his party receiving a wound."
"第十五章 搜寻麋鹿","CHAPTER XV. THE SEARCH FOR THE ELK."
"——波尼人的故事","—PAWNEE STORIES."
"黎明时分，营地里的主要猎手们都提起精神，向着不同的方向出发，去寻找这片土地上的猎物。队长的兄弟比恩中士是最先出发的一拨人中的一个，他早饭前便凯旋了。几乎就在营地的边缘，他打死了一头肥壮的母鹿。","With the morning dawn, the prime hunters of the camp were all on the alert, and set off in different directions, to beat up the country for game.The Captain’s brother, Sergeant Bean, was among the first, and returned before breakfast with success, having killed a fat doe, almost within the purlieus of the camp."
"早饭结束后，队长就骑上他的马，去寻找他前一天晚上打伤的那头麋鹿。他相信它一定受了致命的一击。我决定加入他的搜寻行列。于是，我们一起出发了。同行的还有他那个中士兄弟和一个中尉。两个巡逻骑兵徒步跟着，去带回这个中士之前杀死的那头母鹿。我们没骑多远，便来到了母鹿倒下的地方。那是在一座山丘旁边，一片美丽林地的中央。两个巡逻骑兵马上开始俯身干活。运用真正的猎手才具有的熟练技能，他们把它肢解了，以便运回营地，而我们则继续前进。我们沿路经过倾斜的山坡，穿过灌木丛和稀疏的树林，直到来到了一片因无数麋鹿栖息而把高高的野草压成无数“鹿床”的草地。队长最初就是在这儿惊动那群麋鹿的。对周围仔细地探察了一会儿之后，他指出了它们的“踪迹”；那些脚印和带犄角的牛的一样大。于是，他循着踪迹悄悄前进，其余的人则排成印第安人式的列队跟在他后面。最终，他在那头麋鹿被射中的地方停了下来。周围草上的点点血迹表明，那一枪发挥了作用。从脚印边缘灌木和草皮上的点点血迹可以很明显地看出，那只受伤的动物和兽群里其余的成员一起跑出了一段距离。最终，这些血迹突然消失了。“在这周围的某个地方，”队长说，“那头麋鹿一定是离开了群体。”无论何时，当它们发现自己受了致命伤之后，都将走到一边，找一个偏僻的地方独自死去。","When breakfast was over, the Captain mounted his horse, to go in quest of the elk which he had wounded on the preceding evening; and which, he was persuaded, had received its death-wound.I determined to join him in the search, and we accordingly sallied forth together, accompanied also by his brother, the sergeant, and a lieutenant.Two rangers followed on foot, to bring home the carcass of the doe which the sergeant had killed.We had not ridden far, when we came to where it lay, on the side of a hill, in the midst of a beautiful woodland scene.The two rangers immediately fell to work, with true hunters’ skill, to dismember it, and prepare it for transportation to the camp, while we continued on our course.We passed along sloping hillsides, among skirts of thicket and scattered forest trees, until we came to a place where the long herbage was pressed down with numerous elk beds.Here the Captain had first roused the gang of elks, and, after looking about diligently for a little while, he pointed out their “trail,” the foot-prints of which were as large as those of horned cattle.He now put himself upon the track, and went quietly forward, the rest of us following him in Indian file.At length he halted at the place where the elk had been when shot at.Spots of blood on the surrounding herbage showed that the shot had been effective.The wounded animal had evidently kept for some distance with the rest of the herd, as could be seen by sprinklings of blood here and there, on the shrubs and weeds bordering the trail.These at length suddenly disappeared.“Somewhere hereabout,” said the Captain, “the elk must have turned off from the gang.”Whenever they feel themselves mortally wounded, they will turn aside, and seek some out-of-the-way place to die alone."
"在这幅一头受伤的鹿的最后时刻的场景中，有些东西会触动一个尚未对“追逐”这一高雅的娱乐方式麻木不仁的人的同情心。然而，这种同情转瞬即逝。人类天生是掠夺性的动物，无论因文明而改变多少，人们还是会轻易陷入其毁灭的本能。我发现我贪婪、残暴的倾向在大草原上与日俱增。","There was something in this picture of the last moments of a wounded deer, to touch the sympathies of one not hardened to the gentle disports of the chase; such sympathies, however, are but transient.Man is naturally an animal of prey; and, however changed by civilization, will readily relapse into his instinct for destruction.I found my ravenous and sanguinary propensities daily growing stronger upon the prairies."
"在周围探察了一会儿之后，队长便成功地发现了那头受伤的麋鹿单独的足迹，它是沿着和鹿群成直角的方向转身离开的，进入了一片稀疏开阔的树林。血迹变得越来越模糊、稀少，相隔的距离也越来越远，最终便停止了。而地面非常坚硬，野草被晒得很干，都枯萎了，再也看不到那头动物的脚印了。","After looking about for a little while, the Captain succeeded in finding the separate trail of the wounded elk, which turned off almost at right angles from that of the herd, and entered an open forest of scattered trees.The traces of blood became more faint and rare, and occurred at greater distances: at length they ceased altogether, and the ground was so hard, and the herbage so much parched and withered, that the footprints of the animal could no longer be perceived."
"“那头麋鹿一定在这周围的某个地方，”队长说，“你们看空中盘旋着的那些美洲鹫就知道了，因为它们总是在某个动物尸体的上方以这种方式盘旋。”然而，那头死了的麋鹿是不可能逃跑的，所以，让我们先追踪活着的那些麋鹿的脚印吧！它们有可能就停在不远处，我们也许能看到它们正在吃草，这样便可以再偷袭它们一次。","“The elk must lie somewhere in this neighborhood,” said the Captain, “as you may know by those turkey-buzzards wheeling about in the air: for they always hover in that way above some carcass.”However, the dead elk cannot get away, so let us follow the trail of the living ones: they may have halted at no great distance, and we may find them grazing, and get another crack at them."
"于是我们返了回来，重新追踪麋鹿鹿群的脚印，一路上曲曲折折地经过了覆盖着稀疏橡树的山丘和河谷。我们时不时地会瞥见蹦蹦跳跳穿过林间空地的鹿，但是队长的注意力并没有被这种低等的猎物所分散，他想要猎杀的只是麋鹿。也有一大群火鸡被我们的马蹄声所惊动，有的迈着它们长长的腿拼命逃窜，其余的则拍动翅膀飞上枝头，在上面伸长了脖子盯着我们。队长不允许任何人向它们开枪，以防惊动麋鹿。他希望可以在附近找到它们。最后，我们来到了树林尽头陡峭的河岸边上。雷德福克河就蜿蜒流淌在我们脚下那宽阔的沙地之间。我们沿着足迹看过去，发现鹿群朝着河岸一路向下，穿过了平坦的沙地，直到河里，说明这群麋鹿在前一夜过了河。“没有必要再继续追了，”队长说，“麋鹿一定是吓坏了，过河之后，可能还会不停地跑上二十英里。”","We accordingly returned, and resumed the trail of the elks, which led us a straggling course over hill and dale, covered with scattered oaks.Every now and then we would catch a glimpse of a deer bounding away across some glade of the forest, but the Captain was not to be diverted from his elk hunt by such inferior game.A large flock of wild turkeys, too, were roused by the trampling of our horses; some scampered off as fast as their long legs could carry them; others fluttered up into the trees, where they remained with outstretched necks, gazing at us.The Captain would not allow a rifle to be discharged at them, lest it should alarm the elk, which he hoped to find in the vicinity.At length we came to where the forest ended in a steep bank, and the Red Fork wound its way below us, between broad sandy shores.The trail descended the bank, and we could trace it, with our eyes, across the level sands, until it terminated in the river, which, it was evident, the gang had forded on the preceding evening.“It is needless to follow on any farther,” said the Captain.“The elk must have been much frightened, and, after crossing the river, may have kept on for twenty miles without stopping.”"
"我们的小团队便分开了，中尉和中士绕了个圈子去寻找猎物，而队长和我则朝着营地进发。在路上，我们发现了一串一年多前留下的野牛的脚印。这条小径并不比普通的足迹更宽，但脚印却深深地陷在地里，因为这些动物彼此紧挨着排成一列前进。之后不一会儿，我们遇到两个徒步打猎的巡逻骑兵。他们打伤了一头麋鹿，可它却逃跑了。但在追这头麋鹿的时候，他们发现了队长在前一晚击中的那头。他们返身带我们到它那儿去。这是一只高贵的动物，跟一只一岁的小母牛一样大，躺在树林里的一片开阔地里。这儿距离它被打伤的地方大约有一英里半远。我们之前看到的那些美洲鹫正在它上方的空中盘旋着。队长的论断似乎得到了证实。这可怜的动物，显然是在生命消逝之际离弃了没有受伤的同伴，转到一边独自死去。","Our little party now divided, the lieutenant and sergeant making a circuit in quest of game, and the Captain and myself taking the direction of the camp.On our way, we came to a buffalo track, more than a year old.It was not wider than an ordinary footpath, and worn deep into the soil; for these animals follow each other in single file.Shortly afterward, we met two rangers on foot, hunting.They had wounded an elk, but he had escaped; and in pursuing him, had found the one shot by the Captain on the preceding evening.They turned back, and conducted us to it.It was a noble animal, as large as a yearling heifer, and lay in an open part of the forest, about a mile and a half distant from the place where it had been shot.The turkey-buzzards, which we had previously noticed, were wheeling in the air above it.The observation of the Captain seemed verified.The poor animal, as life was ebbing away, had apparently abandoned its unhurt companions, and turned aside to die alone."
"队长和那两个巡逻骑兵立刻开始干活，他们用猎刀给这尸体剥皮并肢解。它里面已经腐烂了，但是还是有足够的肉块从肋骨和腰腿上割下来，堆在了一张展开的兽皮上。他们沿着兽皮的边缘凿出一些洞，把硬皮带穿过去，然后像个口袋一样拎起来，挂在队长的马鞍后面。在此期间，那些美洲鹫一直在头顶上盘旋着，等待着我们离开，然后俯冲下来，在尸体上饱餐一顿。","The Captain and the two rangers forthwith fell to work, with their hunting-knives, to flay and cut up the carcass.It was already tainted on the inside, but ample collops were cut from the ribs and haunches, and laid in a heap on the outstretched hide.Holes were then cut along the border of the hide, raw thongs were passed through them, and the whole drawn up like a sack, which was swung behind the Captain’s saddle.All this while, the turkey-buzzards were soaring overhead, waiting for our departure, to swoop down and banquet on the carcass."
"这头可怜麋鹿的残骸就这样被分解了。队长和我骑上马，慢慢返回营地。而那两个巡逻骑兵则继续去打猎了。抵达营地时，我发现我们的年轻混血儿安托万在营地了。在阿肯色河的另一边寻找失散的马儿们时，他和贝蒂分开了。之后，他走错了路，沿着那条路走了几英里后，他赶上了老安瑞和他的小分队，才发现原来他一直在沿着他们的踪迹前进。","The wreck of the poor elk being thus dismantled, the Captain and myself mounted our horses, and jogged back to the camp, while the two rangers resumed their hunting.On reaching the camp, I found there our young half-breed, Antoine.After separating from Beatte, in the search after the stray horses on the other side of the Arkansas, he had fallen upon a wrong track, which he followed for several miles, when he overtook old Ryan and his party, and found he had been following their traces."
"他们都在我们过河的地方以北大约八英里处涉水过了阿肯色河，并踏上了去我们在山谷中的上一个营地的路。安托万骑术精湛，又有点儿等不及想和我们汇合，于是就独自前进，循着我们的踪迹来到了我们现在的营地，还带来一头他猎杀的小熊。","They all forded the Arkansas about eight miles above our crossing place, and found their way to our late encampment in the glen, where the rear-guard we had left behind was waiting for them.Antoine, being well mounted, and somewhat impatient to rejoin us, had pushed on alone, following our trail, to our present encampment, and bringing the carcass of a young bear which he had killed."
"这一天余下的时间里，我们的营地呈现出一幅忙乱和安静混杂的景象。其中有些人围着篝火，忙着把鹿肉和熊肉切成长条烤干，准备装起来作为以后的干粮。有些人正在把之前猎杀的动物的皮铺开进行加工处理；有些人在小河里洗衣服，然后把衣服挂在灌木丛上晒干；而还有些人正躺在草地上，在树阴里懒洋洋地聊着天。时不时地会有猎手回来，他们或骑着马，或步行，或满载着猎物，或两手空空。那些带回猎物的人，无论猎物是什么，都把猎物卸在队长的篝火旁。然后成队返回各自的屋子，向他们的同伴讲述自己一天的战绩。营地里猎杀的猎物包括六头普通鹿、一头麋鹿、两只熊和六到八只火鸡。","Our camp, during the residue of the day, presented a mingled picture of bustle and repose.Some of the men were busy round the fires, jerking and roasting venison and bear’s meat, to be packed up as a future supply.Some were stretching and dressing the skins of the animals they had killed; others were washing their clothes in the brook, and hanging them on the bushes to dry; while many were lying on the grass, and lazily gossiping in the shade.Every now and then a hunter would return, on horseback or on foot, laden with game, or empty handed.Those who brought home any spoil, deposited it at the Captain’s fire, and then filed off to their respective messes, to relate their day’s exploits to their companions.The game killed at this camp consisted of six deer, one elk, two bears, and six or eight turkeys."
"在过去的两三天里，自从在渡河时我们的随从们显露了一手印第安人的绝活后，他们在巡逻骑兵的中地位便因此而有所提高。现在我发现，托尼什在一些新招募的、没有来过荒原的、毫无经验的新手中俨然是一个神明。他周围总是围着一群人，听他讲述关于波尼人的夸张故事，好像他和他们有过吓人的交锋似的。其实，他的讲述令听众们产生了一种可怕的印象——他们正在闯入这些敌人的领地。根据他的讲述，白人的步枪永远没法和波尼人的弓和箭相匹敌。步枪的子弹一旦射出，重新装弹费时费力，而与此同时敌人可以不断地开弓放箭。而且，根据托尼什所说，波尼人能够在三百码远的地方准确命中目标，并把他的箭利利索索地射入野牛体内。他甚至还知道一支波尼人的箭射穿了一头野牛后又射伤另一头。然后是波尼人躲避敌人射击的方式：他们会把一条腿搭在马鞍上，身子则蜷缩在马的另一侧，并从马脖子底下射箭，而此时马正在全速奔跑。","During the last two or three days, since their wild Indian achievement in navigating the river, our retainers had risen in consequence among the rangers; and now I found Tonish making himself a complete oracle among some of the raw and inexperienced recruits, who had never been in the wilderness.He had continually a knot hanging about him, and listening to his extravagant tales about the Pawnees, with whom he pretended to have had fearful encounters.His representations, in fact, were calculated to inspire his hearers with an awful idea of the foe into whose lands they were intruding.According to his accounts, the rifle of the white man was no match for the bow and arrow of the Pawnee.When the rifle was once discharged, it took time and trouble to load it again, and in the meantime the enemy could keep on launching his shafts as fast as he could draw his bow.Then the Pawnee, according to Tonish, could shoot, with unerring aim, three hundred yards, and send his arrow clean through and through a buffalo; nay, he had known a Pawnee shaft pass through one buffalo and wound another.And then the way the Pawnees sheltered themselves from the shots of their enemy: they would hang with one leg over the saddle, crouching their bodies along the opposite side of their horse, and would shoot their arrows from under his neck, while at full speed!"
"如果托尼什可信的话，那么在印第安部落这块有争议的土地上，每一步都是危险的。看不见的波尼人潜藏在灌木丛和峡谷中。他们将侦察兵和哨兵安排在能俯瞰整个大草原的山的顶部，在那儿，他们匍匐于高高的草丛中，只是偶尔抬起头观察一下山下排成一长溜的作战部队或狩猎队的行动。到晚上，他们会埋伏在营地周围，匍匐穿过草地，并模仿狼的动作，以欺骗岗哨上的卫兵，等爬得足够近之后，他们便迅疾地一箭射穿他的心脏，然后悄无声息地撤退。在讲故事的时候，托尼什总是不时地向贝蒂求证他所说的是事实，而贝蒂唯一的回答便是点点头或者耸耸肩。贝蒂一方面厌恶他的同伴这种不着边际的乱侃，另一方面也瞧不起那些对他所熟悉的东西一无所知的年轻巡逻骑兵们。","If Tonish was to be believed, there was peril at every step in these debatable grounds of the Indian tribes.Pawnees lurked unseen among the thickets and ravines.They had their scouts and sentinels on the summit of the mounds which command a view over the prairies, where they lay crouched in the tall grass; only now and then raising their heads to watch the movements of any war or hunting party that might be passing in lengthened line below, At night, they would lurk round an encampment; crawling through the grass, and imitating the movements of a wolf, so as to deceive the sentinel on the outpost, until, having arrived sufficiently near, they would speed an arrow through his heart, and retreat undiscovered.In telling his stories, Tonish would appeal from time to time to Beatte, for the truth of what he said; the only reply would be a nod or shrug of the shoulders; the latter being divided in mind between a distaste for the gasconading spirit of his comrade, and a sovereign contempt for the inexperience of the young rangers in all that he considered true knowledge."

"——行军——跛脚马——老瑞安和落伍者——变天的征兆和心情的变化","—THE MARCH.—THE DISABLED HORSE.—OLD RYAN AND THE STRAGGLERS.—SYMPTOMS OF CHANGE OF WEATHER, AND CHANGE OF HUMORS."
"40834.0——我们准备在往常那个时间出发，不过有人给队长捎来口信说有三个巡逻骑兵感染了麻疹，不能继续前进了，另外还有一个骑兵失踪了。失踪的是一个边陲上的老居民，名叫索耶。他虽然在边陲居住了好些年，但却还是没有经验。前一天他出去打猎，可能在大草原上迷了路。因此，一支由十个人组成的护卫队留下来照顾病人，等待落伍者。如果这些病号在两三天内恢复得足够好，那么他们将会重新加入大部队，否则就会被护送回驻地。离开病号营地后，我们沿着几条小溪的源头向西前进。这里所有的小溪都穿过山谷，一路蜿蜒奔向雷德福克河。这片土地地势较高，起伏不平，在西部被称为“绵延起伏”。这里土壤贫瘠，还夹杂着在这片地区比较少见的砂岩，一些粗糙的星毛栎和马利兰栎的树林错落其间。","OCTOBER 18TH.—We prepared to march at the usual hour, but word was brought to the Captain that three of the rangers, who had been attacked with the measles, were unable to proceed, and that another one was missing.The last was an old frontiersman, by the name of Sawyer, who had gained years without experience; and having sallied forth to hunt, on the preceding day, had probably lost his way on the prairies.A guard of ten men was, therefore, left to take care of the sick, and wait for the straggler.If the former recovered sufficiently in the course of two or three days, they were to rejoin the main body, otherwise to be escorted back to the garrison.Taking our leave of the sick camp, we shaped our course westward, along the heads of small streams, all wandering, in deep ravines, towards the Red Fork.The land was high and undulating, or “rolling,” as it is termed in the West; with a poor hungry soil mingled with the sandstone, which is unusual in this part of the country, and checkered with harsh forests of post-oak and black-jack."
"上午的行程中，我接受到了一个重要教训，明白了在大草原上一定要小心自己的马匹。我骑的那匹马在行动上超过了队伍中的大多数马匹，它非常勇敢，精神抖擞。在穿越深沟时，它就像一只猫那样蹿上陡峭的堤岸，并且总是从那些狭窄的水流上一跃而过。之前，我并没有意识到放纵它这种费力行为的轻率之处，直到骑着它跨越一条小溪时，我才感到身下突然踉跄起来。它一跛一跛地向前走了一小段距离，但很快就完全跛了，因为它扭伤了肩膀。接下来该做什么呢？它不可能跟上大部队，但又非常宝贵，不能丢在大草原上。唯一的选择便是把它送回去，加入病号营地病弱者的行列，与他们共命运。然而，尽管我提供了丰厚的奖励，似乎没有人愿意把它带回去。也许是托尼什关于波尼人的故事散布了一种对潜伏着的敌人和大草原上正在逼近的危险的忧虑，也许是他们害怕迷路或走失。最终，两个年轻人走上前来，同意结伴前去。这样安排，等到晚上时，他们可以轮流着一个人警戒，而另一个人睡觉。","In the course of the morning, I received a lesson on the importance of being chary of one’s steed on the prairies.The one I rode surpassed in action most horses of the troop, and was of great mettle and a generous spirit.In crossing the deep ravines, he would scramble up the steep banks like a cat, and was always for leaping the narrow runs of water.I was not aware of the imprudence of indulging him in such exertions, until, in leaping him across a small brook, I felt him immediately falter beneath me.He limped forward a short distance, but soon fell stark lame, having sprained his shoulder.What was to be done?He could not keep up with the troop, and was too valuable to be abandoned on the prairie.The only alternative was to send him back to join the invalids in the sick camp, and to share their fortunes.Nobody, however, seemed disposed to lead him back, although I offered a liberal reward.Either the stories of Tonish about the Pawnees had spread an apprehension of lurking foes, and imminent perils on the prairies; or there was a fear of missing the trail and getting, lost.At length two young men stepped forward and agreed to go in company, so that, should they be benighted on the prairies, there might be one to watch while the other slept."
"于是，我把这匹马交托给了他们照顾。当它一瘸一拐地离开时，我满心后悔地目送着它，恨不得把我浑身的力气和敏捷都传递给它。","The horse was accordingly consigned to their care, and I looked after him with a rueful eye, as he limped off, for it seemed as if, with him, all strength and buoyancy had departed from me."
"我环顾四周，想找一匹坐骑来顶替它。我的目光落在了在事务所时转给托尼什的那匹高大的灰马上。然而，我刚一暗示他下马骑一匹后备的小马，这个小无赖就大喊大叫地抗议起来，同时还捶胸顿足，气喘吁吁的，急于要发泄那一肚子的委屈。我意识到让他下马将会削弱他的精神头，极大冲击他的虚荣心。我不忍心伤害这样一个人，或摧毁这个可怜的小无赖那短暂的虚荣心，于是我继续让他骑着他那匹高大的灰马，而心甘情愿地把我的马鞍放到了那匹疲惫的小马上。","I looked round for a steed to supply his place, and fixed my eyes upon the gallant gray which I had transferred at the Agency to Tonish.The moment, however, that I hinted about his dismounting and taking up with the supernumerary pony, the little varlet broke out into vociferous remonstrances and lamentations, gasping and almost strangling, in his eagerness to give vent to them.I saw that to unhorse him would be to prostrate his spirit and cut his vanity to the quick.I had not the heart to inflict such a wound, or to bring down the poor devil from his transient vainglory; so I left him in possession of his gallant gray; and contented myself with shifting my saddle to the jaded pony."
"现在我可以体会到骑手在大草原上所面临的颠覆性转折了。我意识到了一个骑手的坐骑是如何完完全全地影响他的精神的。之前，我一直随心所欲地离开大部队，飞奔着追逐任何我感兴趣或好奇的目标。现在，我沦落到骑跨在这个疲惫的动物上，这也注定我要耐心而又缓慢地跟在队伍首领的后面。最重要的是，我意识到在这种一个人的生命很可能取决于他的马的力量、速度和充沛精力的长途跋涉中，让顺服的动物消耗不必要的力量是很不明智的。","I was now sensible of the complete reverse to which a horseman is exposed on the prairies.I felt how completely the spirit of the rider depended upon his steed.I had hitherto been able to make excursions at will from the line, and to gallop in pursuit of any object of interest or curiosity.I was now reduced to the tone of the jaded animal I bestrode, and doomed to plod on patiently and slowly after my file leader.Above all, I was made conscious how unwise it is, on expeditions of the kind, where a man’s life may depend upon the strength, and speed, and freshness of his horse, to task the generous animal by any unnecessary exertion of his powers."
"我注意到，大草原上谨慎而又有经验的猎手和旅行者，在行进时总是节约用马，除非是在紧急情况下，否则绝不让它奔跑。在长途旅行中，边陲居民和印第安人一天的行程通常很少超过十五英里，一般是十到十二英里。他们从不随意放纵坐骑飞奔。然而，与我一起旅行的人当中，许多年轻人都没有经验，还因为发现自己处在一个猎物丰富的地区而兴奋不已。让他们对长途行军保持清醒的头脑、约束他们保持队形是不可能的事。我们穿越丛林和山谷的途中，不时地会有被惊动的鹿左右逃窜，这时，子弹便会飕飕地跟在它们后面。年轻的猎手们还会纵马追赶过去。有一次，他们猛追一群自认为是熊的动物，直到发现原来是一群黑色的狼结伴偷偷潜行，他们才马上停了下来。","I have observed that the wary and experienced huntsman and traveller of the prairies is always sparing of his horse, when on a journey; never, except in emergency, putting him off of a walk.The regular journeyings of frontiersmen and Indians, when on a long march seldom exceed above fifteen miles a day, and are generally about ten or twelve, and they never indulge in capricious galloping.Many of those, however, with whom I was travelling were young and inexperienced, and full of excitement at finding themselves in a country abounding with game.It was impossible to retain them in the sobriety of a march, or to keep them to the line.As we broke our way through the coverts and ravines, and the deer started up and scampered off to the right and left, the rifle balls would whiz after them, and our young hunters dash off in pursuit.At one time they made a grand burst after what they supposed to be a gang of bears, but soon pulled up on discovering them to be black wolves, prowling in company."
"大约前进了十二英里之后，刚过正午，我们便在一条弯弯曲曲穿越深谷的小溪旁安营扎寨了。下午，营地的内斯特——老瑞安出现了，后面跟着他的一小伙儿落伍者。他受到了热烈的欢迎，这也显示出了他在山林同胞中所享有的声望。这个小队带来了鹿肉，老猎手把一块硕大的腰腿肉作为礼物放在了队长的篝火旁。","After a march of about twelve miles we encamped, a little after mid-day, on the borders of a brook which loitered through a deep ravine.In the course of the afternoon old Ryan, the Nestor of the camp, made his appearance, followed by his little band of stragglers.He was greeted with joyful acclamations, which showed the estimation in which he was held by his brother woodmen.The little band came laden with venison; a fine haunch of which the veteran hunter laid, as a present, by the Captain’s fire."
"我们的贝蒂和托尼什都在下午的早些时候出发打猎去了。傍晚时分，贝蒂骑着马驮着一头壮实的雄鹿回来了。他像往常一样默默地把它卸下来，然后便去卸马鞍，松开马。托尼什两手空空地回来了，但却带上了更多的荣耀。尽管很不幸的是，所有受伤的鹿都从他身边逃跑了，但他确实射出了致命的几枪。","Our men, Beatte and Tonish, both sallied forth, early in the afternoon, to hunt.Towards evening the former returned, with a fine buck across his horse.He laid it down, as usual, in silence, and proceeded to unsaddle and turn his horse loose.Tonish came back without any game, but with much more glory; having made several capital shots, though unluckily the wounded deer had all escaped him."
"营地里有大量的肉，除了其他的猎物外，还有三头被猎杀的麋鹿。谨慎而老练的山林人都在忙着把肉切成条，以备不时之需。而缺乏经验的人则沉迷于当下的丰盛，而不在乎明天会如何。","There was an abundant supply of meat in the camp; for, besides other game, three elk had been killed.The wary and veteran woodmen were all busy jerking meat, against a time of scarcity; the less experienced revelled in present abundance, leaving the morrow to provide for itself."
"第二天早上（10月19日），我成功地用我的那匹小马和一笔数目可观的钱换得了一匹强壮而又活跃的马。发现自己再一次像模像样地骑着马，我感到非常满足。不过，我发现在队伍中挑选一匹好马还是不算困难的，因为巡逻骑兵们都有“交换”的倾向，他们称之为“交易”，这在西方十分盛行。在我们的远足过程中，几乎所有的马儿、步枪、牛角制火药筒或毯子都更换过几次主人。一个狂热的“交易者”吹嘘说，他曾经通过不断讨价还价把一匹劣等马换成了一匹好马，同时还往自己口袋里赚了一百美元。","On the following morning (October 19th), I succeeded in changing my pony and a reasonable sum of money for a strong and active horse.It was a great satisfaction to find myself once more tolerably well mounted.I perceived, however, that there would be little difficulty in making a selection from among the troop, for the rangers had all that propensity for “swapping,” or, as they term it, “trading,” which pervades the West.In the course of our expedition, there was scarcely a horse, rifle, powder-horn, or blanket that did not change owners several times; and one keen “trader” boasted of having, by dint of frequent bargains, changed a bad horse into a good one, and put a hundred dollars in his pocket."
"早上天色阴沉，天气有些闷热，远处还隐隐传来隆隆的雷声。天气的变化影响了队伍的士气。营地异常地庄重、宁静，没有了以前破晓时分熟悉的农家庭院里各种动物咯咯叫的喧哗，也没有了平日整理行装时遍布营地的哄堂大笑和大声的玩笑声。可能会不时地听到几句哼唱的歌谣、一阵低低的笑声，或者一声孤独的口哨。但总体来说，营地的每一个人都非常安静，或专注于自己的各项职责，或做着出发的准备。","The morning was lowering and sultry, with low muttering of distant thunder.The change of weather had its effect upon the spirits of the troop.The camp was unusually sober and quiet; there was none of the accustomed farmyard melody of crowing and cackling at daybreak; none of the bursts of merriment, the loud jokes and banterings, that had commonly prevailed during the bustle of equipment.Now and then might be heard a short strain of a song, a faint laugh, or a solitary whistle; but, in general, every one went silently and doggedly about the duties of the camp, or the preparations for departure."
"该装马鞍上马时，有人报告说有五匹马失踪了。尽管在营地周围一段距离内的树林和灌木丛都搜索了一遍，但还是没能找到它们。几个巡逻骑兵被派出去到这个区域四周更远的地方去寻找它们。同时，雷声隆隆，之后我们便经历了一场阵雨。马儿们，和它们的骑手一样，都受到了天气变化的影响。它们四散地站在营地周围，有些已经上了马鞍和笼头，其余的还什么也没上，但都精神萎靡，睡眼朦胧，低垂着脑袋，一只后腿微微弯曲，把重心放在蹄尖上好休息一下，而且全身都被雨水打湿了，同时还冒着丝丝水汽。人们也都无精打采地等待着那些出去寻找马的同伴们归来，他们不时用焦急的眼光打量天空中飘浮着的、预示暴风雨将要来临的乌云。阴暗的天气让人产生沮丧的想法。有些人害怕我们被某个印第安团伙跟踪了，认为是他们在夜间偷走了那些马。然而，最普遍的忧虑是，它们沿着脚印回到我们上一个营地去了，或者沿着直线前往吉布森要塞了。在这方面，据说马儿们的直觉跟鸽子相似。它们将会穿过自己从未走过的荒原，沿着直线跑回家。","When the time arrived to saddle and mount, five horses were reported as missing; although all the woods and thickets had been beaten up for some distance round the camp.Several rangers were dispatched to “skir” the country round in quest of them.In the meantime, the thunder continued to growl, and we had a passing shower.The horses, like their riders, were affected by the change of weather.They stood here and there about the camp, some saddled and bridled, others loose, but all spiritless and dozing, with stooping head, one hind leg partly drawn up so as to rest on the point of the hoof, and the whole hide reeking with the rain, and sending up wreaths of vapor.The men, too, waited in listless groups the return of their comrades who had gone in quest of the horses; now and then turning up an anxious eye to the drifting clouds, which boded an approaching storm.Gloomy weather inspires gloomy thoughts.Some expressed fears that we were dogged by some party of Indians, who had stolen the horses in the night.The most prevalent apprehension, however, was that they had returned on their traces to our last encampment, or had started off on a direct line for Fort Gibson.In this respect, the instinct of horses is said to resemble that of the pigeon.They will strike for home by a direct course, passing through tracts of wilderness which they have never before traversed."
"我们的行程推迟了。到上午将尽时，一个中尉和卫兵获命等待巡逻骑兵归来，而我们则启程出发，不过我们大大缩短了行程。我想，这在很大程度上是为了安抚队伍中的一些人，他们隐约担忧万一遇到了波尼人，我们的人手可能会不够。","After delaying until the morning was somewhat advanced, a lieutenant with a guard was appointed to await the return of the rangers, and we set off on our day’s journey, considerably reduced in numbers; much, as I thought, to the discomposure of some of the troop, who intimated that we might prove too weak-handed, in case of an encounter with the Pawnees."

"——暴雨中安营扎寨——夜景——印第安故事——一匹受惊的马","—THE STORM ENCAMPMENT.—NIGHT SCENE.—INDIAN STORIES.—A FRIGHTENED HORSE."
"我们这半天的行程是：往西南走了一段距离，穿过先前提到过的被称为“星毛栎”和“马利兰栎”的枝叶蔓生的低矮树林。这些“栎木荒地”土质疏松，有时只比流沙好一点儿。在雨天，马蹄在这种路上总会从一边滑到另一边，不时还会陷入腐烂湿软的草皮之中，一直没到距毛处。由于连绵不断的雷阵雨，我们陷入了目前的困境，默默地拖着步子缓缓前进。几只鹿因我们的到来而受到了惊吓，飞快地穿过林间空地逃开了，不过这时没有人像之前那样离开队伍去追它们了。有一次，我们看到了野牛的尸骨和牛角，还有一次，我们发现了野牛的脚印，最多是三天前留下的。周围大草原上的这些大型猎物的踪迹，大大重振了猎手们的士气，不过那也只是转瞬即逝而已。","Our march for a part of the day; lay a little to the south of west, through straggling forests of the kind of low scrubbed trees already mentioned, called “post-oaks” and “black-jacks.”The soil of these “oak barrens” is loose and unsound; being little better at times than a mere quicksand, in which, in rainy weather, the horse’s hoof slips from side to side, and now and then sinks in a rotten, spongy turf, to the fetlock.Such was the case at present in consequence of successive thunder-showers, through which we draggled along in dogged silence.Several deer were roused by our approach, and scudded across the forest glades; but no one, as formerly, broke the line of march to pursue them.At one time, we passed the bones and horns of a buffalo, and at another time a buffalo track, not above three days old.These signs of the vicinity of this grand game of the prairies, had a reviving effect on the spirits of our huntsmen; but it was of transient duration."
"当横跨一个几乎被最近的阵雨浇成湿滑沼泽地的中等大小的草原时，我们又遭遇了一场狂风暴雨。雨点劈头盖脸地砸下来，地面上腾起片片蒸汽。周围突然被一片阴暗所包围，更衬托出闪电的刺眼夺目。而雷似乎就在我们头顶轰鸣，回荡在草原上星罗棋布的及林立于草原四周的果园和丛林之中。人和动物遭到这突如其来的暴雨的袭击，浑身上下被浇了个透，都完全不知所措了。有些马吓坏了，几乎难以控制。我们散乱的队伍看起来就像是一支在暴风雨中颠簸飘摇的舰队，任凭狂风巨浪的吹打。","In crossing a prairie of moderate extent, rendered little better than a slippery bog by the recent showers, we were overtaken by a violent thunder-gust.The rain came rattling upon us in torrents, and spattered up like steam along the ground; the whole landscape was suddenly wrapped in gloom that gave a vivid effect to the intense sheets of lightning, while the thunder seemed to burst over our very heads, and was reverberated by the groves and forests that checkered and skirted the prairie.Man and beast were so pelted, drenched, and confounded, that the line was thrown in complete confusion; some of the horses were so frightened as to be almost unmanageable, and our scattered cavalcade looked like a tempest-tossed fleet, driven hither and thither, at the mercy of wind and wave."
"最终，两点半时，我们停了下来，聚集起我们的人马，在一片开阔而茂盛的树林中安营扎寨。这儿一边挨着大草原，另一边挨着一条小溪。森林中马上响起了斧子的砍伐声和树木的轰然倒地声。很快，巨大的火堆熊熊燃烧起来。人们把毯子铺在火堆前，做成帐篷的样子，很快又用树皮和兽皮搭起了窝棚。每一堆火周围都紧紧围着一群人烤火取暖或准备可口的晚餐。有些巡逻骑兵在拆卸和擦拭他们被雨淋湿的步枪。而被卸下马鞍和行李的马则在潮湿的草地上踱步。","At length, at half-past two o’clock, we came to a halt, and gathering together our forces, encamped in an open and lofty grove, with a prairie on one side and a stream on the other.The forest immediately rang with the sound of the axe, and the crash of falling trees.Huge fires were soon blazing; blankets were stretched before them, by way of tents; booths were hastily reared of bark and skins; every fire had its group drawn close round it, drying and warming themselves, or preparing a comforting meal.Some of the rangers were discharging and cleaning their rifles, which had been exposed to the rain; while the horses, relieved from their saddles and burdens, rolled in the wet grass."
"直至深夜，阵雨还是时断时续。天黑之前，我们的马儿们都被集中起来，拴在营地的边缘哨岗以内的地方，以免被印第安人偷去。印第安人往往利用风雨交加的夜晚进行掠夺和袭击。随着夜色加深，巨大的火苗变得更加耀眼，映红了大片高高悬挂于枝头的树叶，在火光的映衬下，树林的其余部分变得更加阴森。每一堆火四周都有一群小精灵围着，被拴着的马影影绰绰，看起来像鬼魂一般，其间偶尔有一匹灰色的马在光影下显出明亮的轮廓。","The showers continued from time to time, until late in the evening.Before dark, our horses were gathered in and tethered about the skirts of the camp, within the outposts, through fear of Indian prowlers, who are apt to take advantage of stormy nights for their depredations and assaults.As the night thickened, the huge fires became more and more luminous; lighting up masses of the overhanging foliage, and leaving other parts of the grove in deep gloom.Every fire had its goblin group around it, while the tethered horses were dimly seen, like spectres, among the thickets; excepting that here and there a gray one stood out in bright relief."
"因此，被断断续续的火焰映红的树林就像是一个巨大的、被深不见底的无尽黑暗所包围的、枝叶繁茂的圆顶。但不时会有两三道闪电接二连三地划破天空，冷不防地照亮广袤的山乡原野。在那儿，田野、森林和奔流的溪水突然映入眼帘，然而这一切只能持续短暂的几秒钟，还没等你留神看，就又立即消失在黑暗之中了。","The grove, thus fitfully lighted up by the ruddy glare of the fires, resembled a vast leafy dome, walled in by opaque darkness; but every now and then two or three quivering flashes of lightning in quick succession, would suddenly reveal a vast champaign country, where fields and forests, and running streams, would start, as it were, into existence for a few brief seconds, and, before the eye could ascertain them, vanish again into gloom."
"大草原上的暴风雨，就像海上的暴风雨一样，通过对无尽的荒野咆哮、怒吼而获得一种崇高威严的地位。这些可怕的自然现象成为可怜的野蛮人迷信的对象，这毫不令人惊奇。他们认为雷鸣是大神发怒的声音。我们的混血儿们在火堆旁闲聊时，我了解到了他们的印第安朋友对这个话题持有的一些观念。他们宣称，有时熄灭的雷电会被大草原上的猎手捡到。他们会拿它做箭或长矛的头，任何有这样装备的战士都是不可战胜的。然而，如果在作战期间遇到雷暴雨，那他就很可能会被雷带走，并从此杳无音信。","A thunder-storm on a prairie, as upon the ocean, derives grandeur and sublimity from the wild and boundless waste over which it rages and bellows.It is not surprising that these awful phenomena of nature should be objects of superstitious reverence to the poor savages, and that they should consider the thunder the angry voice of the Great Spirit.As our half-breeds sat gossiping round the fire, I drew from them some of the notions entertained on the subject by their Indian friends.The latter declare that extinguished thunderbolts are sometimes picked up by hunters on the prairies, who use them for the heads of arrows and lances, and that any warrior thus armed is invincible.Should a thunder-storm occur, however, during battle, he is liable to be carried away by the thunder, and never heard of more."
"一个在大草原上打猎的孔扎部落的战士就曾遭遇了暴风雨，他被雷击倒在地，不省人事。醒来后，他看到雷躺在地上，旁边站着一匹马。他抓起雷，然后跳上了马背，但等他发现他跨上的是闪电时，为时已晚。一瞬间，他被抛到草原、森林、溪流和沙漠之外，直到毫无知觉地落在落基山脉脚下。醒来之后，他用了好几个月的时间才回到自己人中间。","A warrior of the Konza tribe, hunting on a prairie, was overtaken by a storm, and struck down senseless by the thunder.On recovering, he beheld the thunderbolt lying on the ground, and a horse standing beside it.Snatching up the bolt, he sprang upon the horse, but found, too late, that he was astride of the lightning.In an instant he was whisked away over prairies and forests, and streams and deserts, until he was flung senseless at the foot of the Rocky Mountains; whence, on recovering, it took him several months to return to his own people."
"这个故事使我想起了一个旅行者讲述的关于一个武士之死的印第安传说：一个武士看到雷躺在地上，它的两旁各有一只缝制精美的莫卡辛鞋。他以为自己找到了奖励品，便穿上了这双莫卡辛鞋，但它们却把他带到了冥界，他再也没有从那里回来。","This story reminded me of an Indian tradition, related by a traveller, of the fate of a warrior who saw the thunder lying upon the ground, with a beautifully wrought moccason on each side of it.Thinking he had found a prize, he put on the moccasons; but they bore him away to the land of spirits, whence he never returned."
"这些原本都是些简单朴素的故事，但从这些半野蛮的叙述者口中讲出来，却带有一种原始而浪漫的情趣，尤其是在风雨交加的夜晚，大家围坐在猎人的篝火旁，一边是森林，而另一边是荒原时，更不用说是在意外事件或是野蛮的敌人可能正潜伏在周围的黑夜。","These are simple and artless tales, but they had a wild and romantic interest heard from the lips of half-savage narrators, round a hunter’s fire, on a stormy night, with a forest on one side, and a howling waste on the other; and where, peradventure, savage foes might be lurking in the outer darkness."
"我们的交谈被一声巨大的响雷打断了，紧接着传来了一匹马受惊后飞奔到旷野的声音。每一个人都安静地听着。一段时间内，马蹄声清晰可辨，然后渐渐微弱下去，直到消失在远方。","Our conversation was interrupted by a loud clap of thunder, followed immediately by the sound of a horse galloping off madly into the waste.Every one listened in mute silence.The hoofs resounded vigorously for a time, but grew fainter and fainter, until they died away in remote distance."
"一切安静下来之后，听众们开始猜测是什么引起了这匹马的突然奔跑。有些人认为是马被雷声吓着了，而其他人认为是潜伏的印第安人骑着它飞奔而去了。这点遭到了质疑，因为印第安人盗马的惯用方式是：先悄悄接近马，解开它的绳索，慢慢骑上它，然后尽可能轻手轻脚地赶它离开它的同伴，而不发出任何会惊动营地的异常声响。","When the sound was no longer to be heard, the listeners turned to conjecture what could have caused this sudden scamper.Some thought the horse had been startled by the thunder; others, that some lurking Indian had galloped off with him.To this it was objected, that the usual mode with the Indians is to steal quietly upon the horse, take off his fetters, mount him gently, and walk him off as silently as possible, leading off others, without any unusual stir or noise to disturb the camp."
"印第安人惯用的另一种方法是：潜伏在夜晚吃草的马群中间，悄悄骑上一匹马，然后突然间全速离去。对马群来说，再没有比惊慌更容易传染的了。有时，一匹马以这种方式突然跑掉，会惊动整个马群，然后它们会跟着这匹带头的马，仓皇而逃。","On the other hand, it was stated as a common practice with the Indians, to creep among a troop of horses when grazing at night, mount one quietly, and then start off suddenly at full speed.Nothing is so contagious among horses as a panic; one sudden break-away of this kind, will sometimes alarm the whole troop, and they will set off, helter-skelter, after the leader."
"每一个将自己的马放在营地边缘吃草的人都紧张不安起来，生怕自己的马会逃跑。但是事实如何要到早上才能确定。那些把马拴住的人就感觉安全多了。然而，马儿们在夜间被这样拴着，限制在一个很小的范围内，会很容易使它们在长途旅行中精力和体力有所下降。而且，队伍中有许多马已经显露出旅途劳顿的疲惫了。","Every one who had a horse grazing on the skirts of the camp was uneasy, lest his should be the fugitive; but it was impossible to ascertain the fact until morning.Those who had tethered their horses felt more secure; though horses thus tied up, and limited to a short range at night, are apt to falloff in flesh and strength during a long march; and many of the horses of the troop already gave signs of being wayworn."
"郁闷杂乱的夜晚过去之后，我们迎来了一个明亮而又晴朗的清晨，灿烂的阳光仿佛是变魔术般，改变了整个景象。之前阴沉的荒原变成了一片明亮美丽的旷野，上面点缀着静穆的树林和巨大的橡树丛，有的橡树则兀立于如茵的草地上，像是特地为装饰和遮阴而栽种的。而我们的马四散在橡树下吃草，使整个地方看起来就像是一个壮观的公园。我们几乎没有意识到自己是在远离人类居所的荒野之中。我们孤零零的营地面目野蛮：简陋的帐篷是用兽皮和毛毯搭成的，蓝色的炊烟不时从树林中袅袅升起。","After a gloomy and unruly night, the morning dawned bright and clear, and a glorious sunrise transformed the whole landscape, as if by magic.The late dreary wilderness brightened into a fine open country, with stately groves, and clumps of oaks of a gigantic size, some of which stood singly, as if planted for ornament and shade, in the midst of rich meadows; while our horses, scattered about, and grazing under them, gave to the whole the air of a noble park.It was difficult to realize the fact that we were so far in the wilds beyond the residence of man.Our encampment, alone, had a savage appearance; with its rude tents of skins and blankets, and its columns of blue smoke rising among the trees."
"早上第一件事就是巡视我们的马儿们。有一些马溜达到了很远的地方，但幸运的是，所有的马都被找到了，甚至连夜里发出哒哒马蹄声、引起大家不安的那匹也找到了。它停在距离营地大约一英里的地方，在一条小溪旁静静地吃着草。大约八点半时，出发的号角响了起来。由于我们越往前走，遭到印第安人骚扰的危险就越大，所以我们的队伍也排得前所未有的紧凑。每一个人都各自的编队位置，除非有特许，否则任何人不准为追逐猎物而离开队伍。驮马被安置在队伍的中间，由一个强壮的卫兵殿后。","The first care in the morning, was to look after our horses.Some of them had wandered to a distance, but all were fortunately found; even the one whose clattering hoofs had caused such uneasiness in the night.He had come to a halt about a mile from the camp, and was found quietly grazing near a brook.The bugle sounded for departure about half past eight.As we were in greater risk of Indian molestation the farther we advanced our line was formed with more precision than heretofore.Every one had his station assigned him, and was forbidden to leave it in pursuit of game, without special permission.The pack-horses were placed in the centre of the line, and a strong guard in the rear."

"——悬崖城堡——野牛的踪迹——被狼追赶的鹿——十字木林","—CLIFF CASTLE.—BUFFALO TRACKS.—DEER HUNTED BY WOLVES.—CROSS TIMBER."
"费力地穿越了一片遍布峡谷、溪流和难缠的灌木丛的山乡之后，我们来到了一片广阔的大草原。呈现在我们眼前的是远西区的一大特色风景。绵延起伏的草原向远处无限延伸，起起伏伏，间或有一些小树林散落其间，远远望去就像是海上的孤舟。广袤而简单的景色中蕴含着一股庄严宏伟之气。西南方向，一个小山的顶端是一大块碎裂的岩石，看上去就像是一个废弃堡垒。它使我想起了矗立在一片孤零零的西班牙高地顶端的某个摩尔人城堡的废墟。对于这座山，我们给它起名叫悬崖城堡。","After a toilsome march of some distance through a country cut up by ravines and brooks, and entangled by thickets, we emerged upon a grand prairie.Here one of the characteristic scenes of the Far West broke upon us.An immense extent of grassy, undulating, or, as it is termed, rolling country, with here and there a clump of trees, dimly seen in the distance like a ship at sea; the landscape deriving sublimity from its vastness and simplicity.To the southwest, on the summit of a hill, was a singular crest of broken rocks, resembling a ruined fortress.It reminded me of the ruin of some Moorish castle, crowning a height in the midst of a lonely Spanish landscape.To this hill we gave the name of Cliff Castle."
"大草原上这些广阔的狩猎区里的植被，和我之前所经过的所有地区的植被都不相同。这里覆盖着的，不是茂密而又高大的有花植物和随风摆动的细长杂草，而是一种被称为野牛草的低矮植物。野牛草虽然有些粗糙，但在适当的季节却能长得非常茂盛，成为优质的牧草。现在这草长得又硬又直，许多地方都长得太干枯了，不适合放牧。","The prairies of these great hunting regions differed in the character of their vegetation from those through which I had hitherto passed.Instead of a profusion of tall flowering plants and long flaunting grasses, they were covered with a shorter growth of herbage called buffalo grass, somewhat coarse, but, at the proper seasons, affording excellent and abundant pasturage.At present it was growing wiry, and in many places was too much parched for grazing."
"天气正变得晴朗而有些干燥，这个季节被叫做小阳春。空气中弥漫着一层如烟的薄雾，这把刺眼的阳光调成了金黄色，柔和了眼前风景的特点，也模糊了远方事物的轮廓。这层烟雾与日俱增，因为印第安狩猎队正在焚烧远处的草原。","The weather was verging into that serene but somewhat arid season called the Indian Summer.There was a smoky haze in the atmosphere that tempered the brightness of the sunshine into a golden tint, softening the features of the landscape, and giving a vagueness to the outlines of distant objects.This haziness was daily increasing, and was attributed to the burning of distant prairies by the Indian hunting parties."
"我们在大草原上没走多远，就来到了一处有很深脚印的地方。这些脚印踏出的小径在草原上横贯而过，有时两三串脚印相互平行，仅仅相隔几步。有人说这是大群的野牛经过后留下的脚印。那些有经验的猎手仔细观察之后，发现还有马的蹄印。它们不可能是野马的蹄印，因为全是成年马的蹄印，却没有小马的。由于这些马明显没有钉马蹄铁，所以我们推测它们一定属于某个波尼人猎队。在上午的行程中，我们发现了一匹钉着马蹄铁的马的蹄印。这可能是一位彻罗基猎手的马，也可能是一匹从边疆白人那儿偷来的马。因此，在穿越这些危险的荒原时，每一个脚印和凹坑都要受到谨慎的审视和理性的猜测。我们的疑问始终如一：这是朋友的还是敌人的脚印？是最近的还是好久之前的？他们是遥不可及了，还是有可能和我们相遇？","We had not gone far upon the prairie before we came to where deeply worn footpaths were seen traversing the country: sometimes two or three would keep on parallel to each other, and but a few paces apart.These were pronounced to be traces of buffaloes, where large droves had passed.There were tracks also of horses, which were observed with some attention by our experienced hunters.They could not be the tracks of wild horses, as there were no prints of the hoofs of colts; all were full-grown.As the horses evidently were not shod, it was concluded they must belong to some hunting party of Pawnees.In the course of the morning, the tracks of a single horse, with shoes, were discovered.This might be the horse of a Cherokee hunter, or perhaps a horse stolen from the whites of the frontier.Thus, in traversing these perilous wastes, every footprint and dint of hoof becomes matter of cautious inspection and shrewd surmise; and the question continually is, whether it be the trace of friend or foe, whether of recent or ancient date, and whether the being that made it be out of reach, or liable to be encountered."
"我们离狩猎场越来越近了。一路走来，我们不断地看到两边有鹿蹦蹦跳跳地逃到隐蔽处。不过，它们的出现再也不能激起人们之前那种追逐的热情了。当沿着大草原上位于两个突起高地之间的一个斜坡前进时，我们看到了一个真正的、原始的狩猎场面。一个由七匹黑色的狼和一匹白色的狼组成的狼群，正在全力追逐一只已经快精疲力尽的雄鹿。它们穿过了我们的队伍，似乎并没有注意到我们。我们看到，在大约一英里的奔跑过程中，它们离雄鹿越来越近，直到鹿跃下一个沟壑时，它们跳到了它的身上。我们队伍中有些人策马飞奔到一个鼓起的高地上，在那儿可以俯视沟壑里的一切。这只可怜的雄鹿被完全包围了。有的扑向它的侧面，有的扑向它的喉咙。它挣扎了两三下，拼命地跳跃，但还是被拖倒在地，束手就擒，撕成了碎片。无比饥饿而又愤怒的黑狼们，根本顾不上远处的那群猎人。而那匹白色的狼，显然要胆小一些。它放弃了猎物，奔向了山丘和峡谷，惊起了各种各样躲藏在洞里的鹿，它们也向着不同的方向蹦蹦跳跳地逃开了。这是一幅完完整整的野外场景，是名副其实的“狩猎场”。","We were getting more and more into the game country: as we proceeded, we repeatedly saw deer to the right and left, bounding off for the coverts; but their appearance no longer excited the same eagerness to pursue.In passing along a slope of the prairie, between two rolling swells of land, we came in sight of a genuine natural hunting match.A pack of seven black wolves and one white one were in full chase of a buck, which they had nearly tired down.They crossed the line of our march without apparently perceiving us; we saw them have a fair run of nearly a mile, gaining upon the buck until they were leaping upon his haunches, when he plunged down a ravine.Some of our party galloped to a rising ground commanding a view of the ravine.The poor buck was completely beset, some on his flanks, some at his throat: he made two or three struggles and desperate bounds, but was dragged down, overpowered, and torn to pieces.The black wolves, in their ravenous hunger and fury, took no notice of the distant group of horsemen; but the white wolf, apparently less game, abandoned the prey, and scampered over hill and dale, rousing various deer that were crouched in the hollows, and which bounded off likewise in different directions.It was altogether a wild scene, worthy of the “hunting grounds.”"
"现在，雷德福克河又一次映入我们的眼帘，滚滚浊流蜿蜒穿行在树林繁茂的山丘和一望无际的壮美旷野之间。靠近河岸的大草原总是因为有林地而别样多姿，它们将大草原点缀得恰到好处，几乎像是人工所为。仅仅需要在林中点缀上村庄的尖顶、城堡的雉堞、或是古老家族宅邸的角楼，这里便可以与欧洲装饰最精心的景观相媲美了。","We now came once more in sight of the Red Fork, winding its turbid course between well-wooded hills, and through a vast and magnificent landscape.The prairies bordering on the rivers are always varied in this way with woodland, so beautifully interspersed as to appear to have been laid out by the hand of taste; and they only want here and there a village spire, the battlements of a castle, or the turrets of an old family mansion rising from among the trees, to rival the most ornamented scenery of Europe."
"我们大约是在中午时抵达了断断续续的、大约四十英里宽的林地边缘。林地贯穿这片土地的南北，从阿肯色河一直延伸到雷德河，把草原上下分隔开，这里通常被称作“十字木林”。在这片林地的外围，也就是大草原的边缘，我们发现了波尼人营地的遗迹：大约有一百多间木屋，这说明他们当时肯定人数众多。营地附近有一个野牛的头骨，上面覆盖的苔藓表明，这个营地至少已经废弃一年之久了。我们在一个距之大约半英里的漂亮小树林里扎了营，其间流有清泉和小溪。我们今天大约前进了14英里。","About midday we reached the edge of that scattered belt of forest land, about forty miles in width, which stretches across the country from north to south, from the Arkansas to the Red River, separating the upper from the lower prairies, and commonly called the “Cross Timber.”On the skirts of this forest land, just on the edge of a prairie, we found traces of a Pawnee encampment of between one and two hundred lodges, showing that the party must have been numerous.The skull of a buffalo lay near the camp, and the moss which had gathered on it proved that the encampment was at least a year old.About half a mile off we encamped in a beautiful grove, watered by a fine spring and rivulet.Our day’s journey had been about fourteen miles."
"在下午的行进途中，金中尉那队人马中的两个巡逻骑兵加入了我们。几天前他们被留在了后面寻找走失的马。尽管有些马游荡到了好几英里外的地方，但全都找到了。中尉和他那十七个同伴继续留在我们昨晚的营地上打猎。他们发现了野牛最近留下的脚印。他们也看到过一匹体型匀称的野马，不过它飞快地逃开了，速度令他们望尘莫及。","In the course of the afternoon we were rejoined by two of Lieutenant King’s party, which we had left behind a few days before, to look after stray horses.All the horses had been found, though some had wandered to the distance of several miles.The lieutenant, with seventeen of his companions, had remained at our last night’s encampment to hunt, having come upon recent traces of buffalo.They had also seen a fine wild horse, which, however, had galloped off with a speed that defied pursuit."
"现在大家都沉浸在充满信心的推测之中：第二天我们就可能遇到野牛，也许还有野马。每一个人都精神抖擞。我们需要这种刺激，因为我们那些年轻人都渐渐厌倦了在约束下行军和宿营，并且口粮也慢慢匮乏了。队长和几个巡逻骑兵出去打猎了，但他们只带回了一只小鹿和几只火鸡。我们的贝蒂和托尼什也出去了。贝蒂用他的马驮着一头鹿回来了。像往常一样，他一言不发地把它卸在我们的屋子旁边。托尼什两手空空地回来了，但却带回了他惯有的、长长的精彩故事。他和鹿都见证了奇迹。进入他的步枪射程内的每头鹿都遭到了致命的一击，但奇怪的是，每一头都毫不畏缩地继续前进。我们都断定，从他射击的准确性上来看，托尼什一定是用带着魔力的子弹射击的，但每头鹿又都具有魔法般生命。然而，他带来的最重要的情报是，他见到了几匹野马的新鲜蹄印。他现在认为自己很快就能建立伟大的战功了，因为他最引以为傲的就是他的捕马技能了。","Confident anticipations were now indulged, that on the following day we should meet with buffalo, and perhaps with wild horses, and every one was in spirits.We needed some excitement of the kind, for our young men were growing weary of marching and encamping under restraint, and provisions this day were scanty.The Captain and several of the rangers went out hunting, but brought home nothing but a small deer and a few turkeys.Our two men, Beatte and Tonish, likewise went out.The former returned with a deer athwart his horse, which, as usual, he laid down by our lodge, and said nothing.Tonish returned with no game, but with his customary budget of wonderful tales.Both he and the deer had done marvels.Not one had come within the lure of his rifle without being hit in a mortal part, yet, strange to say, every one had kept on his way without flinching.We all determined that, from the accuracy of his aim, Tonish must have shot with charmed balls, but that every deer had a charmed life.The most important intelligence brought by him, however, was, that he had seen the fresh tracks of several wild horses.He now considered himself upon the eve of great exploits, for there was nothing upon which he glorified himself more than his skill in horse-catching."
"第十九章 猎手的期盼","CHAPTER XIX. HUNTERS’ ANTICIPATIONS."
"——陡峭的渡河口——一匹野马","—THE RUGGED FORD.—A WILD HORSE."
"40837.0——今天早上一大早，整个营地就忙碌了起来。今天的旅程中可能遇到野牛，这让每个人都很振奋。他们一个个地拆开来复枪，重新装上子弹：双管枪的子弹被取了出来，新的子弹被换了进去。不过，托尼什主要是在为捕猎野马作准备。他在马鞍的前鞍桥上挂了一卷绳索，放了两根有点儿像钓鱼竿似的、长八到十英尺、顶端装着叉子的白色棍棒，然后进入了旷野。这卷绳索是用来套野马的，人们称之为套索，和南美洲的套索一样。然而，这套索不是用西班牙那种优雅灵巧的方式抛出去的。当猎手经过艰难的追逐，成功地靠近野马，几乎和它齐头并进时，用带叉头的棍棒将活绳结套在马头上，然后任它一路狂奔，把绳索拉直，就像折腾鱼那样折腾它，令其窒息，直至屈服。","OCTOBER 21ST.—This morning the camp was in a bustle at an early hour: the expectation of falling in with buffalo in the course of the day roused every one’s spirit.There was a continual cracking of rifles, that they might be reloaded: the shot was drawn off from double-barrelled guns, and balls were substituted.Tonish, however, prepared chiefly for a campaign against wild horses.He took the field, with a coil of cordage hung at his saddle-bow, and a couple of white wands, something like fishing-rods eight or ten feet in length, with forked ends.The coil of cordage thus used in hunting the wild horse, is called a lariat, and answers to the lasso of South America.It is not flung, however, in the graceful and dexterous Spanish style.The hunter after a hard chase, when he succeeds in getting almost head and head with the wild horse, hitches the running noose of the lariat over his head by means of the forked stick; then letting him have the fully length of the cord, plays him like a fish, and chokes him into subjection."
"托尼什答应会把套马的整个过程展示给我们看，保证让我们满意。可我们对他并没有多大信心，我们担心他会像所有的法国克里奥耳人那样，玩命地驱赶一匹好马去追逐一匹劣马。他可是个毫无怜悯之心的骑手。因此，我们决定密切地监视他，好抑制他突然出击的倾向。","All this Tonish promised to exemplify to our full satisfaction; we had not much confidence in his success, and feared he might knock up a good horse in a headlong gallop after a bad one, for, like all the French creoles, he was a merciless hard rider.It was determined, therefore, to keep a sharp eye upon him, and to check his sallying propensities."
"我们上午的行军还没有进行多远，便被一条深深的小河流挡住了去路。这河流流淌在一个林木茂盛的峡谷的谷底。沿着它走了几英里之后，我们来到了一个渡河的地方。但是要下到河面上去是很困难的，因为河岸很陡峭，土质也很疏松，还长满了大树，灌木丛和荆棘，葡萄藤也缠绕其间。最终，领头的骑手在这灌木丛中开出了一条路。而他的马也把蹄子拢在一起，沿着疏松的黑色河岸滑了下去，来到了河流边上狭窄的空白地上，然后挣扎着过河，泥浆和河水都淹到了马肚带那儿。马终于爬上了对岸，到达了安全的平地上。整支队伍匆忙地跟着领头的骑手，排成像印第安人那样紧密的纵队，前后挨着挤着滑下了河岸，进入到河流中。有些骑手没走上浅滩，头和耳朵都浸入了水中。有一个人还从马背上摔了下来，刚巧一头扎到了河中央。我被后面的人挤着往前走着。匆忙地过了河岸之后，却被一株有缆绳那么粗的葡萄藤给挡住了。它像一条花彩似的低低地挂在马鞍的前鞍桥上，把我从马鞍上拖了下来，摔到了正在前行的马群中间。幸运的是，我毫发无损地逃了出来，重新跨上马，然后轻松过了河，加入了由这滑稽的灾难所引发的欢笑之中。","We had not proceeded far on our morning’s march, when we were checked by a deep stream, running along the bottom of a thickly wooded ravine.After coasting it for a couple of miles, we came to a fording place; but to get down to it was the difficulty, for the banks were steep and crumbling, and overgrown with forest trees, mingled with thickets, brambles, and grape-vines.At length the leading horseman broke his way through the thicket, and his horse, putting his feet together, slid down the black crumbling bank, to the narrow margin of the stream; then floundering across, with mud and water up to the saddle-girths, he scrambled up the opposite bank, and arrived safe on level ground.The whole line followed pell-mell after the leader, and pushing forward in close order, Indian file, they crowded each other down the bank and into the stream.Some of the horsemen missed the ford, and were soused over head and ears; one was unhorsed, and plumped head foremost into the middle of the stream: for my own part, while pressed forward, and hurried over the bank by those behind me, I was interrupted by a grape-vine, as thick as a cable, which hung in a festoon as low as the saddle-bow, and dragging me from the saddle, threw me among the feet of the trampling horses.Fortunately, I escaped without injury, regained my steed, crossed the stream without further difficulty, and was enabled to join in the merriment occasioned by the ludicrous disasters."
"在这种情况下，常常会出现印第安战斗中最危险的埋伏和最血腥的突袭。一群精心隐蔽在灌木丛中的野蛮人，也许会在我们陷入峡谷中时，在我们中间引起可悲的混乱。","It is at passes like this that occur the most dangerous ambuscades and sanguinary surprises of Indian warfare.A party of savages well placed among the thickets, might have made sad havoc among our men, while entangled in the ravine."
"我们现在来到了一个广阔而又壮观的大草原上。大草原在秋季金色阳光的沐浴下尽情延伸。野牛那深深而又频繁出现的脚印表明，这片草原是它们最喜欢来食草的一个地区。但是，我们还是一头野牛也没看到。在上午的行进过程中，之前留在后面的中尉和其他十七个人追上了我们。他们满载着野牛肉而来；前一天他们杀死了三头野牛。然而，有一个巡逻骑兵就没有可以炫耀的好运气了。他的马一见到野牛就吓坏了，把他甩了下去，逃进了树林。","We now came out upon a vast and glorious prairie, spreading out beneath the golden beams of an autumnal sun.The deep and frequent traces of buffalo, showed it to be one of their favorite grazing grounds, yet none were to be seen.In the course of the morning; we were overtaken by the lieutenant and seventeen men, who had remained behind, and who came laden with the spoils of buffaloes; having killed three on the preceding day.One of the rangers, however, had little luck to boast of; his horse having taken fright at sight of the buffaloes, thrown his rider, and escaped into the woods."
"现在，我们的猎手们，无论是年轻的还是年老的，兴奋劲儿都几乎达到了狂热的程度。他们中很少有人碰到过这种大草原上声名远扬的猎物。因此，在那天的途中，当队伍的一角传出“野牛！野牛！”的呼喊时，整支队伍都陷入了一阵骚动。那时，我们正在穿越这个大草原上一个美丽的区域，这里有山丘、斜坡、林木茂盛的山谷，还有高大庄严的树林。那些之前发出警报的人，手指向一个巨大的、看起来是黑色的动物。它正沿着距离我们大约两英里远的一个高地边缘缓慢移动。早已准备好的托尼什一跃而起，站在马鞍上，手握带叉头的棍棒，活像马戏团里准备表演马术绝技的杂技演员或小丑。凝视了那个动物片刻之后——其实不用站在马镫上他也完全可以看清楚——他大声告诉我们，那是一匹野马。然后他重新坐到马鞍上，准备冲出去，全力追逐那匹野马。但让他敢怒不敢言的是，他被叫了回来，奉命坚守岗位，紧跟驮马。","The excitement of our hunters, both young and old, now rose almost to fever height; scarce any of them having ever encountered any of this far-famed game of the prairies.Accordingly, when in the course of the day the cry of “buffalo! buffalo!” rose from one part of the line, the whole troop were thrown in agitation.We were just then passing through a beautiful part of the prairie, finely diversified by hills and slopes, and woody dells, and high, stately groves.Those who had given the alarm, pointed out a large black-looking animal, slowly moving along the side of a rising ground, about two miles off.The ever-ready Tonish jumped up, and stood with his feet on the saddle, and his forked sticks in his hands, like a posture-master or scaramouch at a circus, just ready for a feat of horsemanship.After gazing at the animal for a moment, which he could have seen full as well without rising from his stirrups, he pronounced it a wild horse; and dropping again into his saddle, was about to dash off full tilt in pursuit, when, to his inexpressible chagrin, he was called back, and ordered to keep to his post, in rear of the baggage horses."
"现在，队长和他的两个长官出发去侦察这个猎物。作为一个令人羡慕的神枪手，队长的想法是尽力打伤那匹马，也就是说，用一颗步枪子弹打马的脖子边缘。这类伤势会令马瘫痪片刻。受伤后，马会跌倒在地上，在它神智恢复之前可能就被擒住了。然而，这只是个残酷的权宜之计。因为，一旦方向不对，那就可能杀死这一优雅的动物，或者是使之致残。","The Captain and two of his officers now set off to reconnoitre the game.It was the intention of the Captain, who was an admirable marksman, to endeavor to crease the horse; that is to say, to hit him with a rifle ball in the ridge of the neck.A wound of this kind paralyzes a horse for a moment; he falls to the ground, and may be secured before he recovers.It is a cruel expedient, however, for an ill-directed shot may kill or maim the noble animal."
"队长和他的同伴们沿着野马的方向，从侧面缓缓离去，我们则继续前进。不过，我们都紧密观察着猎物的动向。这匹马安静地越过高地的侧面，然后消失在它后面。队长和他的小分队也很快隐没在了一座横亘在草原上的小山后。","As the Captain and his companions moved off laterally and slowly, in the direction of the horse, we continued our course forward; watching intently, however, the movements of the game.The horse moved quietly over the profile of the rising ground, and disappeared behind it.The Captain and his party were likewise soon hidden by an intervening hill."
"一段时间之后，这匹马突然从我们队伍右前方的一个小山谷中冒了出来，轻快地飞奔着，显然是受到了惊吓。它看到我们，马上停了下来，惊讶地凝视了我们一会儿之后，扭过头去，步态优雅地飞奔起来，不时地通过左右两肩扫视我们，它那浓密的鬓毛和尾巴在风中飘动着。穿过一片篱墙般的灌木丛边缘之后，它在一片旷野上停了下来，又一次回头扫了我们一眼，脖子优美地弯曲着，用力地吸着空气。然后再一次扭头，拔腿飞奔而去，躲进了一个树林里。","After a time, the horse suddenly made his appearance to our right, just ahead of the line, emerging out of a small valley, on a brisk trot; having evidently taken the alarm.At sight of us he stopped short, gazed at us for an instant with surprise, then tossing up his head, trotted off in fine style, glancing at us first over one shoulder, then over the other, his ample mane and tail streaming in the wind.Having dashed through a skirt of thicket, that looked like a hedge-row, he paused in the open field beyond, glanced back at us again, with a beautiful bend of the neck, snuffed the air, then tossing his head again, broke into a gallop, and took refuge in a wood."
"这是我第一次看到一匹浑身洋溢着骄傲和自由天性的马驰骋在属于它的自然荒原之中。和我们城市中那些可怜的、被甲胄和缰绳所束缚并致残的、成为人类奢侈、任性和贪婪的牺牲品的马相比，差别是多么大啊！","It was the first time I had ever seen a horse scouring his native wilderness in all the pride and freedom of his nature.How different from the poor, mutilated, harnessed, checked, reined-up victim of luxury, caprice, and avarice, in our cities!"
"大约前进了十五英里之后，我们在一点钟左右决定宿营，以便猎手们可以有时间弄到吃的。我们的营地建在了小溪旁一个长着高大橡树和胡桃树、而且没有林下灌木的、疏朗的小树林中。在卸驮马上的行李时，我们的小法国人高声地抱怨着我们阻止他去追那匹野马的事，说他一定可以抓到它。同时，我看到我们的混血儿贝蒂，安静地给他最好的马（一匹强壮的半野马）装上马鞍，在马鞍的前鞍桥上挂上一个套索后，手拿步枪和一根带叉头的棍棒骑上马，然后一言不发地离开了营地。很显然，他是去追捕那匹野马，但是他却喜欢独自捕猎。","After travelling about fifteen miles, we encamped about one o’clock, that our hunters might have time to procure a supply of provisions.Our encampment was in a spacious grove of lofty oaks and walnuts, free from underwood, on the border of a brook.While unloading the pack-horses, our little Frenchman was loud in his complaints at having been prevented from pursuing the wild horse, which he would certainly have taken.In the meantime, I saw our half-breed, Beatte, quietly saddle his best horse, a powerful steed of half-savage race, hang a lariat at the saddle-bow, take a rifle and forked stick in hand, and, mounting, depart from the camp without saying a word.It was evident he was going off in quest of the wild horse, but was disposed to hunt alone."
"第二十章 野马的营地","CHAPTER XX. THE CAMP OF THE WILD HORSE."
"猎手的故事——野马的习性——混血儿和他的战利品——追逐野马——被驯服的野性灵魂","HUNTERS STORIES.—HABITS OF THE WILD HORSE.—THE HALF-BREED AND HIS PRIZE.—A HORSE CHASE.—A WILD SPIRIT TAMED."
"我们的营地周围很适合打猎，从各个方向传来的枪声很快地便证明了这一点。我们中的一个猎手很快就肩扛一头绑在皮囊里的母鹿回来了。另一个猎手用马驮回了一头肥壮的雄鹿。还有人又带来了两头鹿和一些火鸡。所有的猎物都扔到了队长的篝火前，准备在各组之间进行分配。很快，烤肉叉和野营水壶都用上了，整个晚上猎手们都在大吃大喝。","We had encamped in a good neighborhood for game, as the reports of rifles in various directions speedily gave notice.One of our hunters soon returned with the meat of a doe, tied up in the skin, and slung across his shoulders.Another brought a fat buck across his horse.Two other deer were brought in, and a number of turkeys.All the game was thrown down in front of the Captain’s fire, to be portioned out among the various messes.The spits and camp kettles were soon in full employ, and throughout the evening there was a scene of hunters’ feasting and profusion."
"今天没能遇到期待中的野牛，我们对此失望不已，但看到野马也是一件新奇的事，夜晚营地谈话的话题也因此发生了转变。有人讲述了几则关于一匹有名的灰马的趣闻。这匹灰马在附近的这个大草原上漫游六七年了，猎手们都想捕获它，但每次都徒劳而返。他们说，无论是全速奔跑还是伸长快步跑（即缓行），它都比跑得最快的马还要快。人们还讲述了同样神奇的布拉索斯河上的一匹黑马的故事。这匹黑马生活在德克萨斯州的布拉索斯河旁边的大草原上。几年来，它逃脱了所有的追捕。它的名声传遍四方，有人为它悬赏一千美元。最勇敢、最厉害的猎手不断试图捕获它去领赏，但都徒劳而返了。最终，它被自己的大胆所害。在一棵树下，它被一匹驯养的母马诱骗了过去，然后被躲在树枝间的小男孩用套索套住了脑袋。","We had been disappointed this day in our hopes of meeting with buffalo, but the sight of the wild horse had been a great novelty, and gave a turn to the conversation of the camp for the evening.There were several anecdotes told of a famous gray horse, which has ranged the prairies of this neighborhood for six or seven years, setting at naught every attempt of the hunters to capture him.They say he can pace and rack (or amble) faster than the fleetest horses can run.Equally marvellous accounts were given of a black horse on the Brazos, who grazed the prairies on that river’s banks in Texas.For years he outstripped all pursuit.His fame spread far and wide; offers were made for him to the amount of a thousand dollars; the boldest and most hard-riding hunters tried incessantly to make prize of him, but in vain.At length he fell a victim to his gallantry, being decoyed under a tree by a tame mare, and a noose dropped over his head by a boy perched among the branches."
"捕获一匹野马，是大草原上各部落最得意的一项功绩。实际上，这也是印第安猎手坐骑的主要来源。那些活动在这片从阿肯色河一直延伸到西班牙殖民地的广阔草原上的野马，体型、颜色各异，这些也表明了它们不同的血统。有些很像在英国很常见的马。它们很可能是从我们边境上的殖民地逃跑的马匹的后代。其余的马体型矮小而强壮，应该是西班牙殖民者带来的安达卢西亚品种。","The capture of a wild horse is one of the most favorite achievements of the prairie tribes; and, indeed, it is from this source that the Indian hunters chiefly supply themselves.The wild horses which range those vast grassy plains, extending from the Arkansas to the Spanish settlements, are of various forms and colors, betraying their various descents.Some resemble the common English stock, and are probably descended from horses which have escaped from our border settlements.Others are of a low but strong make, and are supposed to be of the Andalusian breed, brought out by the Spanish discoverers."
"一些异想天开的思考者们，在它们中间看到了从非洲被带到西班牙，然后又从那儿传到这个地区的阿拉伯品种的后裔。他们自以为是地说，这些马的祖先可能是沙漠上的纯种马，曾驮着穆罕默德和他好战的信徒们穿越阿拉伯地区的沙漠。","Some fanciful speculatists have seen in them descendants of the Arab stock, brought into Spain from Africa, and thence transferred to this country; and have pleased themselves with the idea, that their sires may have been of the pure coursers of the desert, that once bore Mahomet and his warlike disciples across the sandy plains of Arabia."
"阿拉伯人的习性似乎与这种骏马有关。在远西区地区无尽大草原上引进了马之后，当地居民的整个生活模式也随之发生了改变。它为人们快速移动、临时改变居所或远距离迁移带来了便利，满足了人们漫游的倾向。和他们那些蛰伏在晦暗森林的深处、耐心地步行穿越复杂的荒野迷宫的北方同胞不同，西部的印第安人是草原上的漫游者。他们过着一种更加明亮、更加阳光明媚的生活。他们几乎总是骑在马背上，驰骋于广阔而绚丽的大草原和晴朗无云的蓝天之间。","The habits of the Arab seem to have come with the steed.The introduction of the horse on the boundless prairies of the Far West, changed the whole mode of living of their inhabitants.It gave them that facility of rapid motion, and of sudden and distant change of place, so dear to the roving propensities of man.Instead of lurking in the depths of gloomy forests, and patiently threading the mazes of a tangled wilderness on foot, like his brethren of the north, the Indian of the West is a rover of the plain; he leads a brighter and more sunshiny life; almost always on horseback, on vast flowery prairies and under cloudless skies."
"深夜，我正躺在队长的篝火旁，聆听关于这些大草原上的骏马的故事，不禁浮想联翩，突然，营地的另一头传来了一阵骚动和高声欢呼声。有消息传来说混血儿贝蒂带回来了一匹野马。","I was lying by the Captain’s fire, late in the evening, listening to stories about those coursers of the prairies, and weaving speculations of my own, when there was a clamor of voices and a loud cheering at the other end of the camp; and word was passed that Beatte, the half-breed, had brought in a wild horse."
"一瞬间，整个营地的人都离开了篝火，拥过去看贝蒂和他的战利品。这是一匹两岁左右的小马，体型匀称，四肢健壮，有着明亮而突出的眼睛，举止温和而又生机勃勃。它用一种既恐惧又惊讶的眼神凝视着贝蒂，凝视着其余所有的人，凝视着其他的马和营地的篝火。贝蒂则双臂交叉着站在它面前，手握套住它的套索的另一端，沉着冷静地凝视着它。就像我之前观察过的那样，贝蒂那橄榄绿的肤色和坚毅镇定的神色像极了拿破仑的青铜塑像。当他双臂交叉、表情木然地站在猎物前时，看上去更像一尊雕塑，而不是一个活人。","In an instant every fire was deserted; the whole camp crowded to see the Indian and his prize.It was a colt about two years old, well grown, finely limbed, with bright prominent eyes, and a spirited yet gentle demeanor.He gazed about him with an air of mingled stupefaction and surprise, at the men, the horses, and the camp-fires; while the Indian stood before him with folded arms, having hold of the other end of the cord which noosed his captive, and gazing on him with a most imperturbable aspect.Beatte, as I have before observed, has a greenish olive complexion, with a strongly marked countenance, not unlike the bronze casts of Napoleon; and as he stood before his captive horse, with folded arms and fixed aspect, he looked more like a statue than a man."
"然而，如果这匹马显示出丝毫的不顺服，贝蒂就会立马用套索制服它：先把它猛拉向一边，然后又拉向另一边，几乎将它拽倒在地。当它因此而重新变得服帖之后，他就会恢复那种雕塑般的姿态，默默地凝视着它。","If the horse, however, manifested the least restiveness, Beatte would immediately worry him with the lariat, jerking him first on one side, then on the other, so as almost to throw him on the ground; when he had thus rendered him passive, he would resume his statue-like attitude and gaze at him in silence."
"整个场面特别野蛮：高大树林的一部分被营地闪烁的篝火照亮，马儿们被拴在林间各处，鹿的尸体挂在了四周。处在这场面最中间的是这个野蛮的猎手和他的野马，他们被一群几乎同样野蛮的、面露艳羡之色的巡逻骑兵们簇拥着。","The whole scene was singularly wild; the tall grove, partially illumined by the flashing fires of the camp, the horses tethered here and there among the trees, the carcasses of deer hanging around, and in the midst of all, the wild huntsman and his wild horse, with an admiring throng of rangers, almost as wild."
"激动之余，几个年轻的巡逻骑兵想买下这匹马，或者是交换，为此甚至提出了慷慨的条件，可是贝蒂全部都拒绝了。“你们现在给出这么好的价钱，”他说，“明天你们就会后悔，并把钱要回去，还会诅咒说：‘这该死的印第安人！’”","In the eagerness of their excitement, several of the young rangers sought to get the horse by purchase or barter, and even offered extravagant terms; but Beatte declined all their offers.“You give great price now;” said he, “to-morrow you be sorry, and take back, and say ‘D—d Indian!’”"
"这些年轻人胡搅蛮缠地问他是怎样捕获这匹野马的，但他的回答都很简洁生硬。他显然是在为之前被他们轻视和嘲笑争一口气，同时他也瞧不起这些对深奥的丛林科学几乎一无所知的新手们。","The young men importuned him with questions about the mode in which be took the horse, but his answers were dry and laconic; he evidently retained some pique at having been undervalued and sneered at by them; and at the same time looked down upon them with contempt as greenhorns, little versed in the noble science of woodcraft."
"然而后来，他坐在我们的篝火旁时，我轻而易举地就让他说出了捕猎经过。因为，尽管他处在陌生人当中时沉默寡言，不喜欢夸耀自己，但是像所有的印第安人一样，他也有松口的时候。","Afterward, however, when he was seated by our fire, I readily drew from him an account of his exploit; for, though taciturn among strangers, and little prone to boast of his actions, yet his taciturnity, like that of all Indians, had its times of relaxation."
"他告诉我说，离开营地之后，他回到了那匹野马从我们眼前消失的地方。很快，他便找到了它的蹄印，并沿着蹄印来到了河岸边。在这儿，蹄印在沙地上显得更加清晰，他发现马的一只蹄子受伤了，有点儿瘸，所以他放弃了追逐。","He informed me, that on leaving the camp, he had returned to the place where we had lost sight of the wild horse.Soon getting upon its track, he followed it to the banks of the river.Here, the prints being more distinct in the sand, he perceived that one of the hoofs was broken and defective, so he gave up the pursuit."
"在返回营地的路上，他碰到了由六匹马组成的马群。一见到他，马群立刻向河流的方向奔去。他跟着它们过了河，把来复枪放在了河岸上，然后全力策马追赶，很快便追上了这些逃亡者。他试图套住其中的一匹，不过，绳索却套到了它的一只耳朵上，被它抖了下来。马儿们冲上了一座小山，而他步步紧跟。突然，他看到马儿们的尾巴都飘在了空中：它们冲下了一个悬崖。但已经来不及停下来了。他紧闭双眼，屏住呼吸，跟着它们铤而走险地冲了下去。下降了大约二十到三十英尺后，他们都安然无恙地落在了一块沙地上。","As he was returning to the camp, he came upon a gang of six horses, which immediately made for the river.He pursued them across the stream, left his rifle on the river bank, and putting his horse to full speed, soon came up with the fugitives.He attempted to noose one of them, but the lariat hitched on one of his ears, and he shook it off.The horses dashed up a hill, he followed hard at their heels, when, of a sudden, he saw their tails whisking in the air, and they plunging down a precipice.It was too late to stop.He shut his eyes, held in his breath, and went over with them—neck or nothing.The descent was between twenty and thirty feet, but they all came down safe upon a sandy bottom."
"此刻，他成功地用套索套在了一匹漂亮的小马身上。当他和这匹小马一起并肩飞驰时，两匹马从一棵小树的两边奔过，于是套索的一头猛地从他手中脱落。他捡起了绳索，不过，一棵横在当中的树又一次迫使他放开它。他后来又抓住了绳索，并来到了一片更开阔的地区。这时他便可以用绳索戏弄一下小马了，直到小马逐渐被他制服，可以带它去自己放步枪的地方。","He now succeeded in throwing his noose round a fine young horse.As he galloped alongside of him, the two horses passed each side of a sapling, and the end of the lariat was jerked out of his hand.He regained it, but an intervening tree obliged him again to let it go.Having once more caught it, and coming to a more open country, he was enabled to play the young horse with the line until he gradually checked and subdued him, so as to lead him to the place where he had left his rifle."
"带着小马过河时，他又碰到了另一个难题：两匹马都一度陷入了泥潭，贝蒂也差点儿由于湍急的水流和小马的挣扎而从马鞍上摔下来。然而，经过一系列辛劳和困苦之后，他成功地过了河，把他的战利品安全地带回了营地。","He had another formidable difficulty in getting him across the river, where both horses stuck for a time in the mire, and Beatte was nearly unseated from his saddle by the force of the current and the struggles of his captive.After much toil and trouble, however, he got across the stream, and brought his prize safe into camp."
"当晚剩下的时间里，整个营地都保持着一种高昂兴奋的状态。大家谈论的唯一话题就是捕捉野马。队伍中的每一个年轻人都向往这种惊险刺激的追逐；每一个人都信誓旦旦地保证，一定要成功地骑着一匹大草原上的野马返回营地。贝蒂突然间升到了一个很重要的地位。他是最杰出的猎手，是当日的英雄。骑着最好的坐骑的巡逻骑兵们，都愿意让他骑着他们的马去狩猎，只要他会让他们分享他的猎物。贝蒂沉默地应对着他的荣誉，并且回绝了所有的提议。然而，我们的那位说话结巴而又喋喋不休，还喜欢吹牛的小个子法国人却弥补了他的沉默寡言，他对此事大肆吹嘘，好像是他抓住了那匹马。实际上，他的喋喋不休让他在这个问题上显得很内行。他还多次吹嘘说自己曾捉住过许多马。而这使他开始被奉为神明，一些年轻人开始怀疑他是不是甚至比贝蒂更厉害。","For the remainder of the evening, the camp remained in a high state of excitement; nothing was talked of but the capture of wild horses; every youngster of the troop was for this harum-scarum kind of chase; every one promised himself to return from the campaign in triumph, bestriding one of these wild coursers of the prairies.Beatte had suddenly risen to great importance; he was the prime hunter, the hero of the day.Offers were made him by the best mounted rangers, to let him ride their horses in the chase, provided he would give them a share of the spoil.Beatte bore his honors in silence, and closed with none of the offers.Our stammering, chattering, gasconading little Frenchman, however, made up for his taciturnity, by vaunting as much upon the subject as if it were he that had caught the horse.Indeed he held forth so learnedly in the matter, and boasted so much of the many horses he had taken, that he began to be considered an oracle; and some of the youngsters were inclined to doubt whether he were not superior even to the taciturn Beatte."
"这兴奋劲儿使营地比通常休息得晚。嗡嗡的交谈声从围着不同篝火的人群中传来，不时还夹杂着阵阵欢笑声。待所有人都进入梦乡时，夜已经很深了。","The excitement kept the camp awake later than usual.The hum of voices, interrupted by occasional peals of laughter, was heard from the groups around the various fires, and the night was considerably advanced before all had sunk to sleep."
"随着黎明的到来，那股兴奋劲儿又涌了上来。贝蒂和他的野马又一次成了营地关注和谈论的对象。这个俘虏整晚都被拴在马群中的一棵树上。它又一次被贝蒂用一根长长的缰绳或套索牵了出来。和之前一样，当它露出一点儿不顺服，就会被狠狠地拽住，因而又变得服服帖帖。它看上去天性平静顺服，眼睛里透出一种动人而温和的神情。在陌生而又孤独的环境下，这个可怜的动物好像是在那匹帮忙抓住它的马身上寻求保护和友情。","With the morning dawn the excitement revived, and Beatte and his wild horse were again the gaze and talk of the camp.The captive had been tied all night to a tree among the other horses.He was again led forth by Beatte, by a long halter or lariat, and, on his manifesting the least restiveness, was, as before, jerked and worried into passive submission.He appeared to be gentle and docile by nature, and had a beautifully mild expression of the eye.In his strange and forlorn situation, the poor animal seemed to seek protection and companionship in the very horse which had aided to capture him."
"我们要出发时，贝蒂看它如此平静温顺，便在它的背上捆了一个轻包裹，以此来给它上服役的第一课。这一侮辱触发了这动物骄傲独立的天性。它抬起前蹄，又猛然落地，尝试着各种方式来摆脱这个不体面的负担。这个印第安人对它来说太强大了。在每一次突然爆发时，他都能有力地扯住缰绳，直到这个可怜的动物被逼无望，委顿在地，面无表情地躺着，好像是承认自己彻底屈服了。一个表现被俘王子绝望之情的舞台演员，也不能演得比这更淋漓尽致。这里绝对有一种精神感染力在里面。","Seeing him thus gentle and tractable, Beatte, just as we were about to march, strapped a light pack upon his back, by way of giving him the first lesson in servitude.The native pride and independence of the animal took fire at this indignity.He reared, and plunged, and kicked, and tried in every way to get rid of the degrading burden.The Indian was too potent for him.At every paroxysm he renewed the discipline of the halter, until the poor animal, driven to despair, threw himself prostrate on the ground, and lay motionless, as if acknowledging himself vanquished.A stage hero, representing the despair of a captive prince, could not have played his part more dramatically.There was absolutely a moral grandeur in it."
"这个沉着冷静的贝蒂双臂交叉，站了片刻，静静地看着他的俘虏。直到看到它完全屈服，他才慢慢点点头，紧闭的嘴角露出一丝胜利者的讪笑，然后猛地一拉缰绳，命令它起来。它服从了，而且从那刻起再也不反抗了。那天，它耐心地驮着行李，但还是被缰绳牵着。两天之后，它自愿在队伍的后备马匹中跟着前进，不再需要缰绳牵着。","The imperturbable Beatte folded his arms, and stood for a time, looking down in silence upon his captive; until seeing him perfectly subdued, he nodded his head slowly, screwed his mouth into a sardonic smile of triumph, and, with a jerk of the halter, ordered him to rise.He obeyed, and from that time forward offered no resistance.During that day he bore his pack patiently, and was led by the halter; but in two days he followed voluntarily at large among the supernumerary horses of the troop."
"我不得不同情地看着这个漂亮的小动物，它的整个生存方式就这样被突然改变了。突然之间，它从一个生活在这些广阔牧场上，自由驰骋于平原之间、草地之上，随意咀嚼每一棵花草，畅饮每一条河流的草原居民，蜕变为一个永久的、背负痛苦的奴役，套着挽具和马嚼子度过其一生，还有可能没落于尘世的喧嚣和悲苦之中。它的命运转变，有时也会发生在人类身上，尤其是在那些杰出人物的人生之中：前一天还是大草原上的一位王子，第二天却成了一匹驮马。","I could not look without compassion upon this fine young animal, whose whole course of existence had been so suddenly reversed.From being a denizen of these vast pastures, ranging at will from plain to plain and mead to mead, cropping of every herb and flower, and drinking of every stream, he was suddenly reduced to perpetual and painful servitude, to pass his life under the harness and the curb, amid, perhaps, the din and dust and drudgery of cities.The transition in his lot was such as sometimes takes place in human affairs, and in the fortunes of towering individuals:—one day, a prince of the prairies—the next day, a pack-horse!"
"第二十一章 渡过雷德福克河","CHAPTER XXI. THE FORDING OF THE RED FORK."
"——“十字木林”之沉闷森林——野牛！","—THE DREARY FORESTS OF THE “CROSS TIMBER.”—BUFFALO!"
"大约在七点四十五时，我们离开了这个野马营地，接下来，大约向南走了三四英里之后，来到了雷德福克河岸边，我们估计是在其河口之北七十五英里的地方。这条河大约有三百码宽，河水穿行于浅滩和沙洲之间。和往常一样，河两岸及延伸到河流中的长长沙滩上印着各种过来渡河或饮水的动物的足迹。","We left the camp of the wild horse about a quarter before eight, and, after steering nearly south for three or four miles, arrived on the banks of the Red Fork, about seventy-five miles, as we supposed, above its mouth.The river was about three hundred yards wide, wandering among sand-bars and shoals.Its shores, and the long sandy banks that stretched out into the stream, were printed, as usual, with the traces of various animals that had come down to cross it, or to drink its waters."
"在这里，我们停了下来，并展开了很多关于如何安全渡河的讨论，因为我们担心会有流沙。我们正在讨论时，有些落在后面的贝蒂赶了上来。他骑着他那匹半野的马，而他的俘虏则套上了马笼头，用缰绳勒着。他把俘虏来的野马交给托尼什看管，自己一言不发地驱赶着坐骑走进河里，安全地渡过了河。这个人总是用类似的方式干每一件事，迅速、果断而又不声张，没有事先的承诺，也没有事后的吹嘘。","Here we came to a halt, and there was much consultation about the possibility of fording the river with safety, as there was an apprehension of quicksands.Beatte, who had been somewhat in the rear, came up while we were debating.He was mounted on his horse of the half-wild breed, and leading his captive by the bridle.He gave the latter in charge to Tonish, and without saying a word, urged his horse into the stream, and crossed it in safety.Every thing was done by this man in a similar way, promptly, resolutely, and silently, without a previous promise or an after vaunt."
"现在，整支队伍都在贝蒂的带领下，安全无恙地到达了对岸，只有一匹驮马走偏了一点儿，差点儿被一股流沙所吞没，但也被费力地拖到了岸上。","The troop now followed the lead of Beatte, and reached the opposite shore without any mishap, though one of the pack horses wandering a little from the track, came near being swallowed up in a quicksand, and was with difficulty dragged to land."
"渡过河之后，我们不得不艰难地穿越一片大约有一英里长的浓密的芦苇丛。乍一看，这是一片密实得无法穿越的芦苇丛与荆棘林。这是一段艰难的挣扎：烂泥和河水经常没到马肚带处，马和骑手们都受到了灌木和荆棘的困扰及折磨。不过，我们沿着一条偶然发现的野牛的足迹，最终将自己从这片沼泽中解脱了出来，登上了一片高地。展现在我们眼前的是一片美丽广阔的土地。在我们右边的是被称作“十字木林”的林地。在目光所及的范围内，它一直向南延伸。我们很快就离开了这片广阔的土地，钻进了林地。队长的意思是继续向西南偏南的方向前进，并沿着对角线穿过十字木林。他认为这样便可以抵达西部大草原的边缘。他相信，只要保持向南的方向，穿越林带的同时，也接近了雷德河。","After crossing the river, we had to force our way, for nearly a mile, through a thick canebrake, which, at first sight, appeared an impervious mass of reeds and brambles.It was a hard struggle; our horses were often to the saddle-girths in mire and water, and both horse and horseman harassed and torn by bush and brier.Falling, however, upon a buffalo track, we at length extricated ourselves from this morass, and ascended a ridge of land, where we beheld a beautiful open country before us; while to our right, the belt of forest land, called “The Cross Timber,” continued stretching away to the southward, as far as the eye could reach.We soon abandoned the open country, and struck into the forest land.It was the intention of the Captain to keep on southwest by south, and traverse the Cross Timber diagonally, so as to come out upon the edge of the great western prairie.By thus maintaining something of a southerly direction, he trusted, while he crossed the belt of the forest, he would at the same time approach the Red River."
"队长的计划是明智的，但他却因不了解这个地区的自然特征而犯了错。如果他下达指示直接向西走，那么几天之后，我们便可以穿过这片林地，然后可能沿着大草原上部边缘的一条好走的路前往雷德河；而沿着对角线走，我们不得不花费了好些天沉闷的时间，费力地穿越一片阴暗茂密的森林。","The plan of the Captain was judicious; but he erred from not being informed of the nature of the country.Had he kept directly west, a couple of days would have carried us through the forest land, and we might then have had an easy course along the skirts of the upper prairies, to Red River; by going diagonally, we were kept for many weary days toiling through a dismal series of rugged forests."
"这个十字木林宽约四十英里，绵延在散布着星毛栎和马里兰栎的起伏山丘之间，其间还有一些山谷。这些山谷在适合的季节是放牧的好地方。十字木林被多条深深的峡谷所隔断。在雨季，这些峡谷变成临时涨成的小河的河床，成为主要河流的分支，被称为“支流”。年初，整片土地呈现出一片令人愉悦的景象：那时草地青翠，树木葱郁，河水在溪谷中欢腾。不幸的是，我们来得太晚了。这个季节，牧草已经干枯了，低矮树林的叶子也都凋零了，目光所及之处，整个树木全是一片毫无生气的褐色。印第安猎手们在大草原上点起的火，不时会窜到这些树林里，轻盈而又倏忽万变的火苗席卷过干燥的草地，烧焦了树木低处大大小小的树枝，使它们都变为了焦木，也吸走了不得不穿越这片林地的人和马的灵魂。我将永远铭记这段艰难的旅程，以及在穿越这片十字木林时偶尔会遭受的那种身心俱疲的苦恼。那就像是挣扎着穿越铜墙铁壁。","The Cross Timber is about forty miles in breadth, and stretches over a rough country of rolling hills, covered with scattered tracts of post-oak and black-jack; with some intervening valleys, which, at proper seasons, would afford good pasturage.It is very much cut up by deep ravines, which, in the rainy seasons, are the beds of temporary streams, tributary to the main rivers, and these are called “branches.”The whole tract may present a pleasant aspect in the fresh time of the year, when the ground is covered with herbage; when the trees are in their green leaf, and the glens are enlivened by running streams.Unfortunately, we entered it too late in the season The herbage was parched; the foliage of the scrubby forests was withered; the whole woodland prospect, as far as the eye could reach, had a brown and arid hue.The fires made on the prairies by the Indian hunters, had frequently penetrated these forests, sweeping in light transient flames along the dry grass, scorching and calcining the lower twigs and branches of the trees, and leaving them black and hard, so as to tear the flesh of man and horse that had to scramble through them.I shall not easily forget the mortal toil, and the vexations of flesh and spirit, that we underwent occasionally, in our wanderings through the Cross Timber.It was like struggling through forests of cast iron."
"沉闷地骑了几英里之后，我们来到了一片布满小山和山谷的开阔地带，其间还点缀着几片林地。在这儿，我们被“野牛！野牛！”的叫声所唤醒。其影响就像是海上来了“一艘船！一艘船！”的呼喊声。这并不是错误的信号。我们看到，三四只体型庞大的动物在远处一个小山的斜坡上吃着草。","After a tedious ride of several miles, we came out upon an open tract of hill and dale, interspersed with woodland.Here we were roused by the cry of “buffalo! buffalo!”The effect was something like that of the cry of “a sail! a sail!” at sea.It was not a false alarm.Three or four of those enormous animals were visible to our sight grazing on the slope of a distant hill."
"整支队伍都蠢蠢欲动，想要去追逐这些动物。我们花费了好大的力气才抑制住队伍中年轻一点儿的人的冲动。队长留下命令让队伍保持队形，然后，他和两个军官悄悄地启程了。同行的还有贝蒂和那个总是鲁莽好动的托尼什，因为这个小个子法国人近乎疯狂地想要展示他捕猎野牛的技巧和能力，我们无论如何也拦不住他了。","There was a general movement to set off in pursuit, and it was with some difficulty that the vivacity of the younger men of the troop could be restrained.Leaving orders that the line of march should be preserved, the Captain and two of his officers departed at quiet a pace, accompanied by Beatte, and by the ever-forward Tonish; for it was impossible any longer to keep the little Frenchman in check, being half crazy to prove his skill and prowess in hunting the buffalo."
"很快，横亘其间的小山就将猎物和猎手们遮住了。我们继续前行，寻找宿营的地方，但是却难以找到，因为溪流所有的沟槽几乎都干涸了，整个地区都找不到水源。","The intervening hills soon hid from us both the game and the huntsmen.We kept on our course in quest of a camping place, which was difficult to be found; almost all the channels of the streams being dry, and the country being destitute of fountain heads."
"前进了一段距离之后，又响起了野牛的喊声。经人一指，我们看到左边的山丘上有两头野牛。由于队长不在，所以要抑制住年轻猎手的热情也就不可能了。几个年轻猎手全速冲了出去，很快便消失在山谷中；而其余的人则继续前进，焦急地寻找一个适合宿营的地方。","After proceeding some distance, there was again a cry of buffalo, and two were pointed out on a hill to the left.The Captain being absent, it was no longer possible to restrain the ardor of the young hunters.Away several of them dashed, full speed, and soon disappeared among the ravines; the rest kept on, anxious to find a proper place for encampment."
"事实上，我们现在便开始体验这个季节的不便之处了。这片大草原上的牧草稀少而干枯，生长在树木茂盛的低洼地上的豌豆藤都枯萎了，大多数“支流”或河流都干涸了。当我们正因这个问题而彷徨之际，队长及其队伍赶了上来，可其中却没有托尼什。他们追了那头野牛一段距离，却始终没有进入射程以内。因为害怕马匹会劳累，以及被引得离营地太远，他们便放弃了追逐。可是，这个小个子法国人却全速追赶那些野牛。他们最后看到他时，他似乎已经接近了一头巨大的野公牛，正从侧面向它开火。“我认为那个小个子是有点儿疯了。”贝蒂干巴巴地评论说。","Indeed we now began to experience the disadvantages of the season.The pasturage of the prairies was scanty and parched; the pea-vines which grew in the woody bottoms were withered, and most of the “branches” or streams were dried up.While wandering in this perplexity, we were overtaken by the Captain and all his party, except Tonish.They had pursued the buffalo for some distance without getting within shot, and had given up the chase, being fearful of fatiguing their horses, or being led off too far from camp.The little Frenchman, however, had galloped after them at headlong speed, and the last they saw of him, he was engaged, as it were, yard-arm and yard-arm, with a great buffalo bull, firing broadsides into him.“I tink dat little man crazy—somehow” observed Beatte, dryly."
"第二十二章 惊恐的营地","CHAPTER XXII. THE ALARM CAMP."
"我们现在停了下来，不得不马马虎虎地扎了一个营地。营地建在了一小片矮栎林里，处于一个很深的峡谷的边缘，谷底有几方小水池。我们正好在一个缓缓倾斜的山丘的脚下，山丘上覆盖着半枯萎的草，几乎不能放牧。我们宿营的地方，草高而干枯。周围的光景被缓缓隆起的小山所环绕，大部分都被阻挡了。","We now came to a halt, and had to content ourselves with an indifferent encampment.It was in a grove of scruboaks, on the borders of a deep ravine, at the bottom of which were a few scanty pools of water.We were just at the foot of a gradually-sloping hill, covered with half-withered grass, that afforded meagre pasturage.In the spot where we had encamped, the grass was high and parched.The view around us was circumscribed and much shut in by gently swelling hills."
"正当我们安营扎寨时，托尼什荣光满面地狩猎回来了。他的白马上挂满了野牛肉。据他自己所说，他放倒了两头体型巨大的公牛。像往常一样，我们从他的吹嘘中扣除了一半假话。但是，既然他有了点儿真正可以炫耀的东西，也就没有人再抑制他自吹自擂的热情了。","Just as we were encamping, Tonish arrived, all glorious, from his hunting match; his white horse hung all round with buffalo meat.According to his own account, he had laid low two mighty bulls.As usual, we deducted one half from his boastings; but, now that he had something real to vaunt about, there was no restraining the valor of his tongue."
"通过吹嘘自己的战功，满足了些许虚荣心之后，他告诉我们，他发现了新鲜的马蹄印。综合各种情况来看，他怀疑这是某个波尼人的游牧团体留下的。这话引起了些许不安。那些离开行进队伍去追赶那两头野牛的年轻人还没有与我们汇合，有人担心他们可能被拦截或遭到攻击了。我们那经验丰富的猎手老瑞安，也在刚刚停下来扎营时，就在一个年轻徒弟的陪同下徒步外出了。“这个老家伙会被那些波尼人打得脑浆迸裂的，”贝蒂说，“他以为自己无所不知，但无论如何，他不了解波尼人。”","After having in some measure appeased his vanity by boasting of his exploit, he informed us that he had observed the fresh track of horses, which, from various circumstances, he suspected to have been made by some roving band of Pawnees.This caused some little uneasiness.The young men who had left the line of march in pursuit of the two buffaloes, had not yet rejoined us; apprehensions were expressed that they might be waylaid and attacked.Our veteran hunter, old Ryan, also, immediately on our halting to encamp, had gone off on foot, in company with a young disciple.“Dat old man will have his brains knocked out by de Pawnees yet,” said Beatte.“He tink he know every ting, but he don’t know Pawnees, anyhow.”"
"队长拿上他的步枪，徒步走到附近一个山丘光秃秃的山顶上，从那儿探视着这片土地。同时，有的人捆上马腿，松开缰绳让它们吃草；有的人砍木头生火，准备晚餐。","Taking his rifle, the Captain repaired on foot to reconnoitre the country from the naked summit of one of the neighboring hills.In the meantime, the horses were hobbled and turned loose to graze; and wood was cut, and fires made, to prepare the evening’s repast."
"突然，营地里报起了火警！一个引火的火苗点着了高高的干草，而此时微风习习，所以整个营地可能很快便会被火焰包围。“看好马匹！”一个人喊道；“把行李拖走！”另一个喊道。“小心步枪和火药桶！”第三个喊道。整个营地陷入了一片忙乱和骚动。马儿们四散狂奔；有些人匆忙地挪走步枪和火药桶，其他人则拖走马鞍和马褡裢。与此同时，却没有一个人想到灭火，也没有人确切地知道该如何灭火。然而，贝蒂和他的同伴用印第安人的方式处理着火势：用毯子及马衣扑打火的边缘，尽力阻止它在草地上蔓延。那些巡逻骑兵们也效仿着他们的做法，不一会儿，火苗便被幸运地扑灭了。","Suddenly there was an alarm of fire in the camp!The flame from one of the kindling fires had caught to the tall dry grass; a breeze was blowing; there was danger that the camp would soon be wrapped in a light blaze.“Look to the horses!” cried one; “Drag away the baggage!” cried another.“Take care of the rifles and powder-horns!” cried a third.All was hurry-scurry and uproar.The horses dashed wildly about; some of the men snatched away rifles and powder-horns, others dragged off saddles and saddle-bags.Meantime, no one thought of quelling the fire, nor indeed knew how to quell it.Beatte, however, and his comrades attacked it in the Indian mode, beating down the edges of the fire with blankets and horse-cloths, and endeavoring to prevent its spreading among the grass; the rangers followed their example, and in a little while the flames were happily quelled."
"现在，火堆在干草已经清除干净的地方被正确地引燃了。马儿们分散在一个小山谷周围及一个斜山坡上，正啃着稀少的草木。托尼什正在用他的野牛肉准备一顿奢华的晚餐，他许诺将给我们呈上浓郁的鲜汤和顶级的烤牛肉。但我们注定要经历另一次更加严重的惊吓。","The fires were now properly kindled on places from which the dry grass had been cleared away.The horses were scattered about a small valley, and on the sloping hill-side, cropping the scanty herbage.Tonish was preparing a sumptuous evening’s meal from his buffalo meat, promising us a rich soup and a prime piece of roast beef: but we were doomed to experience another and more serious alarm."
"山顶上隐约传来某个巡逻骑兵出于本能的叫喊声，我们仅能辨别出的是：“马！马！上马！”","There was an indistinct cry from some rangers on the summit of the hill, of which we could only distinguish the words “The horses! the horses! get in the horses!”"
"这马上引起了一阵喧嚣：喊叫声、询问声、回答声全混在了一起，什么都听不清，每个人都得出了自己的推论。","Immediately a clamor of voices arose; shouts, inquiries, replies, were all mingled together, so that nothing could be clearly understood, and every one drew his own inference."
"“队长惊动了野牛，”一个人喊道，“想用马去追逐。”马上，许多巡逻骑兵抓起步枪，奔向山顶。“山外面的那个大草原着火了，”另一个喊道，“我看到烟了——队长是说我们应该把马匹赶到河的另一侧。”","“The Captain has started buffaloes,” cried one, “and wants horses for the chase.”Immediately a number of rangers seized their rifles, and scampered for the hill-top.“The prairie is on fire beyond the hill,” cried another; “I see the smoke—the Captain means we shall drive the horses beyond the brook.”"
"这时，一个从山上来的巡逻骑兵到达了营地的边缘。他几乎上气不接下气，只是说队长发现远处有印第安人。","By this time a ranger from the hill had reached the skirts of the camp.He was almost breathless, and could only say that the Captain had seen Indians at a distance."
"“是波尼人！是波尼人！”我们那些想入非非的年轻人开始大喊。“把马匹赶进营地！”一个人喊道。“上马鞍！”另一个喊道。“整队！”第三个喊道。此刻一片喧嚣混乱，根本听不清大家在说什么。巡逻骑兵们都跑向附近的旷野，寻找自己的马匹。我们可以看到，有的人用缰绳拖拽着马；有的人骑在光秃秃的马背上，帽子都没戴；还有的人驱赶着面前两腿仍被捆绑着的马，马像袋鼠一样笨拙地跳跃着。","“Pawnees!Pawnees!” was now the cry among our wild-headed youngsters.“Drive the horses into camp!” cried one.“Saddle the horses!” cried another.“Form the line!” cried a third.There was now a scene of clamor and confusion that baffles all description.The rangers were scampering about the adjacent field in pursuit of their horses.One might be seen tugging his steed along by a halter; another without a hat, riding bare-backed; another driving a hobbled horse before him, that made awkward leaps like a kangaroo."
"警报升级了。营地下面的那一头传来消息说，有一群波尼人在附近的一个山谷中。他们已经打穿了老瑞安的脑袋，现在正在追赶他的同伴！“不，不是老瑞安被杀了，而是其中一个追赶那两头野牛的猎手。”“山丘外面有三百个波尼人。”一个声音喊道。“不止，不止！”另一个喊道。","The alarm increased.Word was brought from the lower end of the camp that there was a band of Pawnees in a neighboring valley.They had shot old Ryan through the head, and were chasing his companion!“No, it was not old Ryan that was killed—it was one of the hunters that had been after the two buffaloes.”“There are three hundred Pawnees just beyond the hill,” cried one voice.“More, more!” cried another."
"我们的处境是：山丘切断了一切，因而视线受阻，看不到远处。于是我们成了谣言的牺牲品。残酷的敌人应该就在附近，一场正面冲突看来在所难免。这时，马匹都被赶进了营地，正冲撞在篝火之间，踩踏在包裹之上。每一个人都尽力准备作战，但这儿还是一片混乱。在先前的火警中，马鞍、缰绳、步枪、火药桶及其他的装备都已经被抓离它们原来的位置，在树林中扔得到处都是。","Our situation, shut in among hills, prevented our seeing to any distance, and left us a prey to all these rumors.A cruel enemy was supposed to be at hand, and an immediate attack apprehended.The horses by this time were driven into the camp, and were dashing about among the fires, and trampling upon the baggage.Every one endeavored to prepare for action; but here was the perplexity.During the late alarm of fire, the saddles, bridles, rifles, powder-horns, and other equipments, had been snatched out of their places, and thrown helter-skelter among the trees."
"一个人喊道：“我的马鞍去哪儿了？”另一个人喊道：“有人见过我的步枪吗？”第三个人喊道：“谁能借给我一颗子弹？”他正在给手枪装弹药。“我的子弹盒找不到了。”“上帝啊，帮我给这匹马固定好马鞍吧！”另一个喊道，“它太不老实了，我拿它没办法啊！”在匆忙和担忧之中，他把马鞍给前后放反了。","“Where is my saddle?” cried one.“Has any one seen my rifle?” cried another.“Who will lend me a ball?” cried a third, who was loading his piece.“I have lost my bullet pouch.”“For God’s sake help me to girth this horse!” cried another: “he’s so restive I can do nothing with him.”In his hurry and worry, he had put on the saddle the hind part before!"
"有些人假装无所畏惧，大摇大摆地走动和高声地谈论着；其余的人则沉默不语，不慌不忙地准备着自己的马和武器。就是在后面这些人身上，我得到了最大的依赖感。有些人一想到要遇到印第安人了，很明显地就兴高采烈起来；但没有人比我年轻的瑞士旅行伙伴更兴奋的了。他对野外冒险有着一种狂热。贝蒂则把马牵到营地的后面，把步枪靠在一棵树上，然后一声不吭地坐在篝火旁。与此同时，正忙着做饭的小个子托尼什，在每一次干活停下来的间隙，不是在吹嘘，就是唱歌，或是在咒骂，并假装着不自然的兴高采烈。这使我强烈地怀疑，这些欢欣实际上源于一种发自心底的小小恐惧。","Some affected to swagger and talk bold; others said nothing, but went on steadily, preparing their horses and weapons, and on these I felt the most reliance.Some were evidently excited and elated with the idea of an encounter with Indians; and none more so than my young Swiss fellow-traveller, who had a passion for wild adventure.Our man, Beatte, led his horses in the rear of the camp, placed his rifle against a tree, then seated himself by the fire in perfect silence.On the other hand, little Tonish, who was busy cooking, stopped every moment from his work to play the fanfaron, singing, swearing, and affecting an unusual hilarity, which made me strongly suspect there was some little fright at bottom, to cause all this effervescence."
"大约有十二个巡逻骑兵一给他们的马上好马鞍，便朝着据说是波尼人袭击猎手的方向冲去了。以防营地遭到攻击，我们现在决定把马放到后面的峡谷。在那儿，它们可以免遭弓箭或子弹的威胁。而且我们也决定把守在峡谷的边缘。峡谷可以作为一个战壕，边缘的树木和灌木丛将足以抵挡敌人的任何弓箭。另外，波尼人对攻打这类隐蔽的地方是很谨慎的。正如我之前曾经说过的那样，他们的战斗都发生在开阔的大草原上，在那儿，骑着迅捷的战马，他们能够像老鹰那样飞扑向敌人，或是围着他们开弓放箭。然而，我也禁不住担心，一旦被这些据说就在附近的骑术精湛且能征善战的野蛮人攻击，我们还会面临很大的危险，因为我们新招募的巡逻骑兵大都缺乏经验和纪律，许多年轻一点儿的还都年轻气盛，似乎一心想要冒险和赢得战功。","About a dozen of the rangers, as soon as they could saddle their horses, dashed off in the direction in which the Pawnees were said to have attacked the hunters.It was now determined, in case our camp should be assailed, to put our horses in the ravine in the rear, where they would be out of danger from arrow or rifle-ball, and to take our stand within the edge of the ravine.This would serve as a trench, and the trees and thickets with which it was bordered, would be sufficient to turn aside any shaft of the enemy.The Pawnees, besides, are wary of attacking any covert of the kind; their warfare, as I have already observed, lies in the open prairie, where, mounted upon their fleet horses, they can swoop like hawks upon their enemy, or wheel about him and discharge their arrows.Still I could not but perceive, that, in case of being attacked by such a number of these well-mounted and war-like savages as were said to be at hand, we should be exposed to considerable risk from the inexperience and want of discipline of our newly raised rangers, and from the very courage of many of the younger ones who seemed bent on adventure and exploit."
"到这时，队长回到了营地，每一个人都挤到他周围打听消息。他告诉我们，他在侦察过程中前进了一段距离，然后慢慢返回营地。途经一座光秃秃的山丘的山梁时，他看到在一座平行的山丘的边缘有什么东西，看上去像是一个人。他停下来仔细查看，可是它纹丝不动，于是他猜测那是一丛灌木或是山后某棵树的树梢。他又重新上路，而它也同样开始沿着平行的方向移动。此刻，它旁边的另一个身影站了起来，此人要么是之前一直躺着，要么是刚刚从山的另一面爬上来的。队长停下来注视着他们；而他们也同样停了下来。然后他躺在草地上，他们则开始走动。当他站起来时，他们又停了下来，好像是在观察他。由于知道印第安人喜欢派侦察兵和哨兵驻守在光秃秃的山顶上，以便获得广阔的视野，因此他的疑虑也因这些人的可疑之举而增加了不少。此时，他把自己的军便帽放在步枪的一端，并在空中挥舞。他们并没有在意这个信号。然后，他又继续前进，直到进入了一片林地的边缘把自己隐藏起来，不被他们看见。避开他们的视线一会儿之后，他又探头张望，这时他看到那两个人已经轻快地跑了过去。他们所走的山丘和他站的位置之间隔着一道弧形的山坳，他们似乎是在尽力在他到达营地之前超过他。由于怀疑他们可能属于某个较大的印第安团伙，正准备伏击或正沿着山丘外侧的山谷移动，所以队长加快了返程的脚步。发现在他与营地之间的高地上有一些巡逻骑兵之后，他便向他们高声叫喊，传话说让他们把马匹赶进去，因为马通常是印第安人最先劫掠的目标。","By this time the Captain reached the camp, and every one crowded round him for information.He informed us, that he had proceeded some distance on his reconnoitring expedition, and was slowly returning toward the camp, along the brow of a naked hill, when he saw something on the edge of a parallel hill, that looked like a man.He paused and watched it; but it remained so perfectly motionless, that he supposed it a bush, or the top of some tree beyond the hill.He resumed his course, when it likewise began to move in a parallel direction.Another form now rose beside it, of some one who had either been lying down, or had just ascended the other side of the hill.The Captain stopped and regarded them; they likewise stopped.He then lay down upon the grass, and they began to walk.On his rising, they again stopped, as if watching him.Knowing that the Indians are apt to have their spies and sentinels thus posted on the summit of naked hills, commanding extensive prospects, his doubts were increased by the suspicious movements of these men.He now put his foraging cap on the end of his rifle, and waved it in the air.They took no notice of the signal.He then walked on, until he entered the edge of a wood, which concealed him from their view.Stopping out of sight for a moment, he again looked forth, when he saw the two men passing swiftly forward.As the hill on which they were walking made a curve toward that on which he stood, it seemed as if they were endeavoring to head him before he should reach the camp.Doubting whether they might not belong to some large party of Indians, either in ambush or moving along the valley beyond the hill, the Captain hastened his steps homeward, and, descrying some rangers on an eminence between him and the camp, he called out to them to pass the word to have the horses driven in, as these are generally the first objects of Indian depredation."
"这就是最初使营地陷入骚乱的警报。他们当中一些听过队长描述的人，肯定那些在山上的人就是波尼人的侦察兵，而这些人属于伏击猎人的那个团伙。间或会听到远处传来的枪声，这应该就是那些出发去解救同伴的那些人开的枪。又有几个巡逻骑兵收拾好了装备，朝着开枪的地方策马奔去；另一些人则看起来焦急不安。","Such was the origin of the alarm which had thrown the camp in commotion.Some of those who heard the Captain’s narration, had no doubt that the men on the hill were Pawnee scouts, belonging to the band that had waylaid the hunters.Distant shots were heard at intervals, which were supposed to be fired by those who had sallied out to rescue their comrades.Several more rangers, having completed their equipments, now rode forth in the direction of the firing; others looked anxious and uneasy."
"“如果他们像传言那样人数众多，”一个人说道，“而且骑术还像往常那样精湛，那我们拖着疲惫的马，绝不是他们的对手。”","“If they are as numerous as they are said to be,” said one, “and as well mounted as they generally are, we shall be a bad match for them with our jaded horses.”"
"“但是，”队长回应说，“我们有一个坚固的营地，可以抵挡他们的包围。”","“Well,” replied the Captain, “we have a strong encampment, and can stand a siege.”"
"“嗯，可是他们也许会晚上在大草原上放火，把我们驱赶出营地。”","“Ay, but they may set fire to the prairie in the night, and burn us out of our encampment.”"
"“那么我们就点火反击！”","“We will then set up a counter-fire!”"
"此刻有消息传来说，一个骑在马背上的人接近了营地。","The word was now passed that a man on horseback approached the camp."
"“那是我们的一个猎人！”“是克莱门茨！”“他带回了野牛肉！”当这个骑手跑近时，几个声音同时响了起来。","“It is one of the hunters!It is Clements!He brings buffalo meat!” was announced by several voices as the horseman drew near."
"实际上，他是早上出发去追逐那两头野牛的巡逻骑兵中的一个。他骑进了营地，马背上挂满了追逐到的战利品，后面跟着他的同伴。所有的人都安然无恙，并且都满载而归。他们接着讲述了追逐这两头野牛壮丽征程，以及用了多少发子弹才把其中一头打倒在地。","It was, in fact, one of the rangers who had set off in the morning in pursuit of the two buffaloes.He rode into the camp, with the spoils of the chase hanging round his horse, and followed by his companions, all sound and unharmed, and equally well laden.They proceeded to give an account of a grand gallop they had had after the two buffaloes, and how many shots it had cost them to bring one to the ground."
"“那么，但是波尼人——波尼人——波尼人在哪儿？”","“Well, but the Pawnees—the Pawnees—where are the Pawnees?”"
"“什么波尼人？”","“What Pawnees?”"
"“袭击你们的波尼人。”","“The Pawnees that attacked you.”"
"“没有人袭击我们。”","“No one attacked us.”"
"“但是你们一路上没看到印第安人吗？”","“But have you seen no Indians on your way?”"
"“哦，是啊，我们中的两个来到一个山丘上寻找营地，看到一个人在对面的山上，形迹可疑，他可能是一个印第安人。”","“Oh yes, two of us got to the top of a hill to look out for the camp and saw a fellow on an opposite hill cutting queer antics, who seemed to be an Indian.”"
"“啐！那是我！”队长说。","“Pshaw! that was I!” said the Captain."
"到这儿，一切真相大白了。整个警报是由队长和这两个巡逻骑兵的误解而引发的。至于那三百个波尼人和他们对猎手的袭击，则是有人肆意虚构的。虽然造谣的人应该被追查出来，严加处罚，但谁也没有再进一步提及此事。","Here the bubble burst.The whole alarm had risen from this mutual mistake of the Captain and the two rangers.As to the report of the three hundred Pawnees and their attack on the hunters, it proved to be a wanton fabrication, of which no further notice was taken; though the author deserved to have been sought out, and severely punished."
"看来是没有任何战斗的可能了，每个人现在想到的就是吃饭。这营地里所有人的胃都不约而同地感到饿了。托尼什把他许诺过的美味的牛肉汤和野牛肉端给了我们。这汤里撒了太多的胡椒粉，烤牛肉也表明这头公牛是大草原上的一头老牛；我还从未嚼过这么老的牛肉。不过，这毕竟是我们的第一次牛肉盛宴，所以我们都吃得很开心。而且小个子法国人也不让我们停住嘴，直到逼着我们说他的烹调技术很高超为止，不过喉咙里的胡椒揭穿了我们的谎言。","There being no longer any prospect of fighting, every one now thought of eating; and here the stomachs throughout the camp were in unison.Tonish served up to us his promised regale of buffalo soup and buffalo beef.The soup was peppered most horribly, and the roast beef proved the bull to have been one of the patriarchs of the prairies; never did I have to deal with a tougher morsel.However, it was our first repast on buffalo meat, so we ate it with a lively faith; nor would our little Frenchman allow us any rest, until he had extorted from us an acknowledgment of the excellence of his cookery; though the pepper gave us the lie in our throats."
"夜幕降临了，但老瑞安和他的同伴还没有回来。然而，我们已经习惯了这只林中老公鸡的反常举动了，也没有人再表示对他的担心了。","The night closed in without the return of old Ryan and his companion.We had become accustomed, however, to the aberrations of this old cock of the woods, and no further solicitude was expressed on his account."
"一天的疲劳和兴奋之后，整个营地很快就进入了沉沉的睡梦中。但那些站岗的除外，他们比平时更加警惕了，因为不久前我们发现了波尼人的踪迹，我们肯定是在他们的狩猎场内，这都激发了他们的高度警惕。大约十点半时，我们所有人又被一次新的警报从睡梦中惊醒。一个哨兵开了枪，并跑进营地，高声喊叫说附近有印第安人。","After the fatigues and agitations of the day, the camp soon sunk into a profound sleep, excepting those on guard, who were more than usually on the alert; for the traces recently seen of Pawnees, and the certainty that we were in the midst of their hunting grounds, excited to constant vigilance.About half past ten o’clock we were all startled from sleep by a new alarm.A sentinel had fired off his rifle and run into camp, crying that there were Indians at hand."
"每个人都立刻爬了起来。有些人抓起了步枪，有些人正要给马装上马鞍，有些人急匆匆地跑到队长的屋子里，但是却获令返回各自的篝火旁。那个哨兵受到了询问。他宣称自己看到一个印第安人正趴在地上，慢慢靠近营地；于是，他对他开了一枪，然后跑进了营地。队长的意见是，那个所谓的印第安人是一匹狼；他责备这个哨兵擅离职守，命令他回到岗位上。有些人似乎倾向于相信那个哨兵所说的，因为白天发生的事情已经使他们担心可能有埋伏的敌人，他们可能会趁着夜色发动突袭。很长的一段时间里，他们坐在篝火旁，手持步枪，小声地交谈着，竖耳聆听，等待着某个新的警报。然而，再也没有发生什么事。谈话声渐渐消失了，交谈者都昏昏欲睡，最终又酣然入睡。逐渐地，寂静和酣睡又一次笼罩了整个营地。","Every one was on his legs in an instant.Some seized their rifles; some were about to saddle their horses; some hastened to the Captain’s lodge, but were ordered back to their respective fires.The sentinel was examined.He declared he had seen an Indian approach, crawling along the ground; whereupon he had fired upon him, and run into camp.The Captain gave it as his opinion, that the supposed Indian was a wolf; he reprimanded the sentinel for deserting his post, and obliged him to return to it.Many seemed inclined to give credit to the story of the sentinel; for the events of the day had predisposed them to apprehend lurking foes and sudden assaults during the darkness of the night.For a long time they sat round their fires, with rifle in hand, carrying on low, murmuring conversations, and listening for some new alarm.Nothing further, however, occurred; the voices gradually died away; the gossipers nodded and dozed, and sunk to rest; and, by degrees, silence and sleep once more stole over the camp."

"——野牛和马的踪迹一条波尼人踪迹——野马——年轻的猎手和熊——改变路线","—BUFFALO AND HORSE TRACKS.A PAWNEE TRAIL.—WILD HORSES.—THE YOUNG HUNTER AND THE BEAR.—CHANGE OF ROUTE."
"我们队伍集合的那天（10月23日）早上，老瑞安和他的同伴还没有回来。但是队长完全相信这个经验丰富的林中人的技巧和才智，所以他并不认为需要为他采取任何措施。","On mustering our forces in the morning (October 23d), old Ryan and his comrade were still missing; but the Captain had such perfect reliance on the skill and resources of the veteran woodsman, that he did not think it necessary to take any measures with respect to him."
"我们这一天的行程同样是穿越高低起伏、道路崎岖的山乡，时而经过沉闷的褐色星毛栎林，时而被深深的干涸峡谷所隔断。远处大草原上的火明显烧得更加旺盛了。西北风已经刮了好几天了，空气中开始烟雾弥漫，就像是最典型的小阳春天气，人们很难看清任何远处的物体。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　","Our march this day lay through the same kind of rough rolling country; checkered by brown dreary forests of post-oak, and cut up by deep dry ravines.The distant fires were evidently increasing on the prairies.The wind had been at northwest for several days; and the atmosphere had become so smoky, as in the height of Indian summer, that it was difficult to distinguish objects at any distance."
"在上午的行程中，我们跨过了一条很深的溪流。溪上有一个完整的海狸坝，高出溪面三英尺，围出了一个很大的水塘。虽然没有一只海狸将鼻子露出水面，但那里无疑有着好几个这种勤劳动物的家庭。队长不允许我们打扰这种两栖动物。","In the course of the morning, we crossed a deep stream with a complete beaver dam, above three feet high, making a large pond, and doubtless containing several families of that industrious animal, though not one showed his nose above water.The Captain would not permit this amphibious commonwealth to be disturbed."
"我们现在不断发现野牛和野马的踪迹。我们能够从被踩踏过的草的倒向辨认出，野牛总是方向不变地向南走。很明显，我们正走在这些迁徙的动物群所走过的路上，它们主要都是向南去的。","We were now continually coming upon the tracks of buffaloes and wild horses; those of the former tended invariably to the south, as we could perceive by the direction of the trampled grass.It was evident we were on the great highway of these migratory herds, but that they had chiefly passed to the southward."
"贝蒂通常都会在与我们的队伍相隔几百码的地方，与我们平行前进，以便留意猎物的动静，并用印第安人那锐利的目光留神每一条踪迹。他报告说他发现了一条非常可疑的踪迹。路上有波尼人的莫卡辛鞋踏出的踪迹。他闻到了混合着漆树和烟草的烟味，而这是印第安人常用的。他发现了夹杂着一只狗的脚印的马蹄印，以及绳索拖过地面的痕迹，可能是印第安骑手的长长的马勒，一头拖在了地上。很明显，这不是野马的踪迹。我再次开始担心起老猎手瑞安的安全，因为我非常喜欢这个真正的老猎手。然而，每一个人都表示他们相信，无论瑞安在哪儿，他都是安全的，他知道如何照顾自己。","Beatte, who generally kept a parallel course several hundred yards distant from our line of march, to be on the lookout for game, and who regarded every track with the knowing eye of an Indian, reported that he had come upon a very suspicious trail.There were the tracks of men who wore Pawnee moccasons.He had scented the smoke of mingled sumach and tobacco, such as the Indians use.He had observed tracks of horses, mingled with those of a dog; and a mark in the dust where a cord had been trailed along; probably the long bridle, one end of which the Indian horsemen suffer to trail on the ground.It was evident, they were not the tracks of wild horses.My anxiety began to revive about the safety of our veteran hunter Ryan, for I had taken a great fancy to this real old Leatherstocking; every one expressed a confidence, however, that wherever Ryan was, he was safe, and knew how to take care of himself."
"我们在已经完成了这一天疲劳行程的大部分，正穿越一片橡树林中的空地时，看到了六匹野马。其中我特别注意到有两匹非常漂亮，一匹是灰色的，另一匹是沙色的。它们高昂着头四处奔腾，长长的尾巴在空中飘动着，和我们那些因旅途劳顿而无精打采的可怜坐骑形成了鲜明的对比。观察了我们一会儿之后，它们便飞奔而去了，穿过一个葱郁的小峡谷，不一会儿又出现在我们的视线中，它们正在跑上一个大约一英里外的斜坡。","We had accomplished the greater part of a weary day’s march, and were passing through a glade of the oak openings, when we came in sight of six wild horses, among which I especially noticed two very handsome ones, a gray and a roan.They pranced about, with heads erect, and long flaunting tails, offering a proud contrast to our poor, spiritless, travel-tired steeds.Having reconnoitred us for a moment, they set off at a gallop, passed through a woody dingle, and in a little while emerged once more to view, trotting up a slope about a mile distant."
"看到这些马，对爱吹嘘的托尼什来说又是一次痛苦的折磨。他已准备好套索和带叉头的棍棒，正打算骑着那匹疲惫的马去追逐那些野马，却又一次被命令回到驮马那儿。一天的行程中，我们向西南方向前进了十四英里。之后，我们便在十字木林北部边界上的一条清澈小河边上安营扎寨了，而这条小河处在一直延伸到落基山脚下的广阔大草原的边缘。松开缰绳放马儿们去吃草时，它们的脖铃中都被塞满了草。这是为了防止它们叮当响，而被某个游荡的波尼人部族听见。","The sight of these horses was again a sore trial to the vaporing Tonish, who had his lariat and forked stick ready, and was on the point of launching forth in pursuit on his jaded horse, when he was again ordered back to the pack-horses.After a day’s journey of fourteen miles in a southwest direction, we encamped on the banks of a small clear stream, on the northern border of the Cross Timber; and on the edge of those vast prairies, that extend away to the foot of the Rocky Mountains.In turning loose the horses to graze, their bells were stuffed with grass to prevent their tinkling, lest it might be heard by some wandering horde of Pawnees."
"猎手们此刻都朝着不同的方向出去了，但是却收获寥寥，只带回营地一头鹿。一个年轻的巡逻骑兵，讲了一个关于自己冒险的长长的故事。他绕过一片深谷中的灌木丛时，打伤了一头雄鹿，并清楚听到它倒在了灌木丛中。他停下来修理了一下出了故障的步枪保险栓，并重新装上了子弹，然后跑到了灌木丛的边缘去寻找他的猎物。接着，他听到了一阵低沉的咆哮声。他拨开树枝，偷偷探出头向谷底张望，看到了一头巨大的熊沿着一条小河的干燥河床一边拖动着鹿的尸体，一边向四五匹多管闲事、似乎想和它分享晚餐的狼咆哮着。","Our hunters now went out in different directions, but without much success, as but one deer was brought into the camp.A young ranger had a long story to tell of his adventures.In skirting the thickets of a deep ravine he had wounded a buck, which he plainly heard to fall among the bushes.He stopped to fix the lock of his rifle, which was out of order, and to reload it; then advancing to the edge of the thicket, in quest of his game, he heard a low growling.Putting the branches aside, and stealing silently forward, he looked down into the ravine and beheld a huge bear dragging the carcass of the deer along the dry channel of a brook, and growling and snarling at four or five officious wolves, who seemed to have dropped in to take supper with him."
"这个巡逻骑兵向熊开了一枪，不过没有打中。布鲁因坚守着阵地和和他的战利品，似乎准备投入战斗。那些显然饿坏了的狼，也只是后退了一小段距离。随着夜幕降临，这个年轻的巡逻骑兵对这个荒芜而又黑暗的地方，以及碰到的这些陌生的伙伴感到恐惧。所以他悄悄地撤退了，两手空空地回到了营地。在这儿，讲述了他的故事之后，他被那些更有经验的伙伴们痛快地取笑了一番。","The ranger fired at the bear, but missed him.Bruin maintained his ground and his prize, and seemed disposed to make battle.The wolves, too, who were evidently sharp set, drew off to but a small distance.As night was coming on, the young hunter felt dismayed at the wildness and darkness of the place, and the strange company he had fallen in with; so he quietly withdrew, and returned empty handed to the camp, where, having told his story, he was heartily bantered by his more experienced comrades."
"晚上，老瑞安跋涉回了营地，后面跟着他的徒弟。和往常一样，他受到了亲切的祝贺。他昨天打猎时迷路了，于是整晚露宿在外面。但是，早上发现了我们的踪迹后，就跟了上来。他在海狸坝那儿呆了一会儿，欣赏筑坝的技巧及其坚固的构造。“这些海狸，”他说，“都是些勤劳的小家伙。据我所知，它们是最聪明的淘气鬼，我相信水塘底下还有一大堆呢。”","In the course of the evening, old Ryan came straggling into the camp, followed by his disciple, and as usual was received with hearty gratulations.He had lost himself yesterday, when hunting, and camped out all night, but had found our trail in the morning, and followed it up.He had passed some time at the beaver dam, admiring the skill and solidity with which it had been constructed.“These beavers,” said he, “are industrious little fellows.They are the knowingest varment as I know; and I warrant the pond was stocked with them.”"
"“对，”队长说，“我敢肯定我们经过的大多数小河里都满是海狸。我打算整个冬天都来这些水域下网。”","“Aye,” said the Captain, “I have no doubt most of the small rivers we have passed are full of beaver.I would like to come and trap on these waters all winter.”"
"“但是你不会遭到印第安人的袭击吗？”一个同伴问道。","“But would you not run the chance of being attacked by Indians?” asked one of the company."
"“哦，至于这个嘛，这里冬天是足够安全的。直到春天这里才会有印第安人。我最多只需要两个同伴。逮捕海狸时，三个人比一大群人安全多了。他们可以保持安静，很少需要开枪。”一头熊可以供他们吃两个月，熊身上的每一部分都可以得到充分利用。","“Oh, as to that, it would be safe enough here, in the winter time.There would be no Indians here until spring.I should want no more than two companions.Three persons are safer than a large number for trapping beaver.They can keep quiet, and need seldom fire a gun.”A bear would serve them for food, for two months, taking care to turn every part of it to advantage."
"我们当下又举行了一场商讨会来确定将来的行程。到目前为止，我们一直走的是西边的一条路，并且已经穿过了十字木林，来到了西部大草原的边缘。可是，我们还是在一片非常崎岖的食物稀少的区域。目前已经到了草枯萎的季节了，这个大草原也提供不了牧草。旅程的一段时间里维持我们的坐骑生存、长在灌木丛底下的豌豆藤也几乎消失了。过去几天里，这些可怜的动物们体力和精气神都日渐衰竭。印第安人在大草原上点着的火从北边、南边，以及西边向我们靠近；它们也可能从东边蔓延过来，在我们和边疆之间留下一片焦土，我们的马匹在那儿也许就要挨饿了。","A consultation was now held as to our future progress.We had thus far pursued a western course; and, having traversed the Cross Timber, were on the skirts of the Great Western Prairie.We were still, however, in a very rough country, where food was scarce.The season was so far advanced that the grass was withered, and the prairies yielded no pasturage.The pea-vines of the bottoms, also, which had sustained our horses for some part of the journey, were nearly gone, and for several days past the poor animals had fallen off wofully both in flesh and spirit.The Indian fires on the prairies were approaching us from north, and south, and west; they might spread also from the east, and leave a scorched desert between us and the frontier, in which our horses might be famished."
"因此大家决定不再向西前进了，而是转头更多地向东走，以便尽快到达加拿大人河的北部支流。我们希望在那儿可以找到充足的幼藤。在每年的这个季节里，幼藤是对马匹来说最有营养的牧草了。同时，它也吸引了大量的猎物。然后，我们在这儿限制了一下去远西区的旅程，准备花一天多点儿的时间沿着克萨斯州的边界线走。","It was determined, therefore, to advance no further to the westward, but to shape our course more to the east, so as to strike the north fork of the Canadian, as soon as possible, where we hoped to find abundance of young cane, which, at this season of the year, affords the most nutritious pasturage for the horses; and, at the same time, attracts immense quantities of game.Here then we fixed the limits of our tour to the Far West, being within little more than a day’s march of the boundary line of Texas."
"第二十四章 面包匮乏","CHAPTER XXIV. SCARCITY OF BREAD."
"——邂逅野牛——野火鸡——一头野公牛倒下了","—RENCONTRE WITH BUFFALOES.—WILD TURKEYS.—FALL OF A BUFFALO BULL."
"早上，天空明快而晴朗，但营地里却没有了往常的欢乐。农家庭院的音乐会结束了：没有了公鸡的打鸣声，也没有了狗叫声；更听不到歌声或是笑声了。每个人都安静而严肃地进行着自己的工作。旅行的新奇劲儿都消耗殆尽了。一些年轻人和他们的马儿们一样，由于长途旅行而疲惫不堪。他们中大多数人都不习惯猎手的生活，开始抱怨生活必需品的匮乏。他们最不满的就是面包的匮乏，他们已经好几天没能吃到面食了。那些经常遭受这种匮乏的老猎手们，则对此很不在乎。而贝蒂在印第安人群中时，就已经习惯了几个月没有面食的生活了，仅仅把它当成是一种奢侈品。“面包，”他会轻蔑地说，“只是小孩子喜欢吃的东西。”","The morning broke bright and clear, but the camp had nothing of its usual gayety.The concert of the farmyard was at an end; not a cock crew, nor dog barked; nor was there either singing or laughing; every one pursued his avocations quietly and gravely.The novelty of the expedition was wearing off.Some of the young men were getting as way-worn as their horses; and most of them, unaccustomed to the hunter’s life, began to repine at its privations.What they most felt was the want of bread, their rations of flour having been exhausted for several days.The old hunters, who had often experienced this want, made light of it; and Beatte, accustomed when among the Indians to live for months without it, considered it a mere article of luxury.“Bread,” he would, say scornfully, “is only fit for a child.”"
"大约七点四十五时，我们背离了远西区地区，沿着一个地势平缓的山谷向东南方向前进。骑了几英里之后，一直与我们保持平行、沿着我们右侧一个光秃秃小山的山脊行走的贝蒂，突然叫喊起来并发出信号，似乎是有什么东西在围向这座小山来拦截我们。一些在我附近的人叫喊说那是一伙波尼人。周围的灌木丛使我们看不到假想敌的靠近。我们听到密集的丛林中传来一阵脚步声。我的马朝着那个地方看了看，嘴里喷着鼻息，耳朵竖了起来。这时，我们看到几头被贝蒂惊动的、体型巨大的野牛拥挤着穿过灌木丛，直接朝我们奔来。一看到我们，它们马上调头，然后沿着一条山间的隘路跑去。马上，十来支步枪同时开火。队伍中响起一片欢呼声，有一半的人急忙去追，而我也是其中一员。我们中的大多数人很快便止步了，停止了这场追逐，因为其间要穿过桦树林和荆棘丛，以及一个非常危险的峡谷。几个巡逻骑兵坚持追逐了一会儿，不过最终也还是一个个地慢慢加入了队伍。他们中有一个人是步行回来的。在全速追逐时，他被甩了下来，他的步枪因此而摔坏了，而他的马则保持着骑手的精神，继续追赶野牛去了。他沦落到了一个可悲的境地：身处波尼人的狩猎场，却既没有马，又没有武器。","About a quarter before eight o’clock, we turned our back upon the Far West, and set off in a southeast course, along a gentle valley.After riding a few miles, Beatte, who kept parallel with us, along the ridge of a naked hill to our right, called out and made signals, as if something were coming round the hill to intercept us.Some who were near me cried out that it was a party of Pawnees.A skirt of thickets hid the approach of the supposed enemy from our view.We heard a trampling among the brushwood.My horse looked toward the place, snorted and pricked up his ears, when presently a couple of large buffalo bulls, who had been alarmed by Beatte, came crashing through the brake, and making directly toward us.At sight of us they wheeled round, and scuttled along a narrow defile of the hill.In an instant half a score of rifles cracked off; there was a universal whoop and halloo, and away went half the troop, helter-skelter in pursuit, and myself among the number.The most of us soon pulled up, and gave over a chase which led through birch and brier, and break-neck ravines.Some few of the rangers persisted for a time; but eventually joined the line, slowly lagging one after another.One of them returned on foot; he had been thrown while in full chase; his rifle had been broken in the fall, and his horse, retaining the spirit, of the rider, had kept on after the buffalo.It was a melancholy predicament to be reduced to; without horse or weapon in the midst of the Pawnee hunting grounds."
"就我而言，我最近真够幸运的，通过又一次的交换，我得到了这支队伍中最好的马匹。它是一匹纯种的栗色马，有着极好的耐力、漂亮的形体和最温顺的性格。","For my own part, I had been fortunate enough recently, by a further exchange, to get possession of the best horse in the troop; a full-blooded sorrel of excellent bottom, beautiful form, and most generous qualities."
"在这种情况下，好像是一个人和他的马互换了角色。由于我身下骑有了一个既精神又温顺，异常听话而又行动从容、迅捷、灵活的动物，我感觉自己非常像另一种生物。几天之后，它几乎像一只小狗那样一直粘着我：当我不骑马时，它就跟着我；早上，它会来到我身旁，以引起我的注意，让我抚摸它；当我坐在树下看书时，它会把嘴凑到我和书之间。我对我这位默默无语的大草原伙伴的感觉，使我依稀意识到了阿拉伯人对驮着他们行走于沙漠中的马匹的依恋之情。","In such a situation it almost seems as if a man changes his nature with his horse.I felt quite like another being, now that I had an animal under me, spirited yet gentle, docile to a remarkable degree, and easy, elastic, and rapid in all his movements.In a few days he became almost as much attached to me as a dog; would follow me when I dismounted, would come to me in the morning to be noticed and caressed; and would put his muzzle between me and my book, as I sat reading at the foot of a tree.The feeling I had for this my dumb companion of the prairies, gave me some faint idea of that attachment the Arab is said to entertain for the horse that has borne him about the deserts."
"又骑了几公里之后，我们来到了一片漂亮的草地，一条宽阔清澈的小河蜿蜒而过，河岸上长着优质的牧草。我们立刻在这儿停了下来，停在了一片美丽的榆树林中一个奥赛奇人的旧营地上。我们刚刚下马，便响起了一片射击火鸡的枪声。因为有一大群火鸡散落在这个小树林里，证明这是这儿些单纯的鸟类最喜爱的栖息地。它们飞到树上，栖坐在树枝上，探出长长的脖子，愚蠢而又惊讶地凝视着一切，直到有十八只同胞被打了下来。","After riding a few miles further, we came to a fine meadow with a broad clear stream winding through it, on the banks of which there was excellent pasturage.Here we at once came to a halt, in a beautiful grove of elms, on the site of an old Osage encampment.Scarcely had we dismounted, when a universal firing of rifles took place upon a large flock of turkeys, scattered about the grove, which proved to be a favorite roosting-place for these simple birds.They flew to the trees, and sat perched upon their branches, stretching out their long necks, and gazing in stupid astonishment, until eighteen of them were shot down."
"在屠杀的高峰期，有消息传来说在一个临近的草地上有四头野牛。现在，因为有了更好的猎物，猎手们便放弃了火鸡。那些疲惫的马匹又一次被人骑上，被驱赶着去追逐野牛。不一会儿，我们便看到了野牛，它们看起来像高高的绿色牧草中的褐色小山丘。贝蒂尽力跑到它们前面，迫使它们回头向我们跑来，这样那些没有经验的猎手也许会有机会下手。它们围着一个乱石嶙峋的小山的底部奔跑着，很快就从我们的视线中消失了。我们当中有一些人力图穿越这个小山，但却陷入了一片布满葡萄藤的浓密树林中。我的马在它的上一个骑手的胯下就曾追捕过野牛，现在它就像我一样兴奋，尽力想要穿越这片灌木丛。最终，我们从中解脱了出来，飞奔过了那个小山。我发现，我们的小个子法国人托尼什正高高兴兴地骑在马背上，围着一头被他打成重伤而无法逃跑的、体型巨大的野牛打转。他一直盯着它，直到我们赶上来。看到这个巨大的动物和它奇异的攻击者，感觉就像是壮丽和滑稽混杂在一起。这头野牛一直站立着，把它长满蓬乱长毛的脑袋正对着敌人。它的嘴大大地张着，露出了干燥的舌头，眼睛像是燃烧着的煤块，尾巴愤怒地竖立着。它不时会无力地扑向它那可以轻易避开它的攻击、并在它面前做着各种滑稽动作的敌人。","In the height of the carnage, word was brought that there were four buffaloes in a neighboring meadow.The turkeys were now abandoned for nobler game.The tired horses were again mounted, and urged to the chase.In a little while we came in sight of the buffaloes, looking like brown hillocks among the long green herbage.Beatte endeavored to get ahead of them and turn them towards us, that the inexperienced hunters might have a chance.They ran round the base of a rocky hill, that hid us from the sight.Some of us endeavored to cut across the hill, but became entrapped in a thick wood, matted with grape-vines.My horse, who, under his former rider, had hunted the buffalo, seemed as much excited as myself, and endeavored to force his way through the bushes.At length we extricated ourselves, and galloping over the hill, I found our little Frenchman, Tonish, curvetting on horseback round a great buffalo which he had wounded too severely to fly, and which he was keeping employed until we should come up.There was a mixture of the grand and the comic, in beholding this tremendous animal and his fantastic assailant.The buffalo stood with his shaggy front always presented to his foe; his mouth open, his tongue parched, his eyes like coals of fire, and his tail erect with rage; every now and then he would make a faint rush upon his foe, who easily evaded his attack, capering and cutting all kinds of antics before him."
"我们又朝这头野牛开了几枪，子弹都没有打进它那庞大的身躯，都不足以致命。它缓慢而又庄重地后退到一条浅浅的小河中。只要攻击者们一逼近，它就会回过头来对着他们。当在这片水中时，它在那儿站稳脚跟，似乎准备抵御围攻。然而，一颗更为致命的步枪子弹射进了它的躯体，全身猛烈地颤抖了一下。它掉过头去试图涉过这条小溪，不过踉跄了几步之后，便慢慢地倒向一边，死去了。一个英雄倒下了，我们因屠杀了它而感到有点儿羞愧。但是，打了最初的一两枪之后，我们便照旧争辩说这是在让这个可怜的动物摆脱苦难，以此聊以自慰。","We now made repeated shots at the buffalo, but they glanced into his mountain of flesh without proving mortal.He made a slow and grand retreat into the shallow river, turning upon his assailants whenever they pressed upon him; and when in the water, took his stand there as if prepared to sustain a siege.A rifle-ball, however, more fatally lodged, sent a tremor through his frame.He turned and attempted to wade across the stream, but after tottering a few paces, slowly fell upon his side and expired.It was the fall of a hero, and we felt somewhat ashamed of the butchery that had affected it; but, after the first shot or two, we had reconciled it to our feelings, by the old plea of putting the poor animal out of his misery."
"这天晚上还有两头野牛也被猎杀了，但都是公牛。每年的这个季节，它们的肉又瘦又硬。晚餐中，一头肥壮的雄鹿为我们提供了更加可口的肉食。","Two other buffaloes were killed this evening, but they were all bulls, the flesh of which is meagre and hard, at this season of the year.A fat buck yielded us more savory meat for our evening’s repast."
"第二十五章 包围野马","CHAPTER XXV. RINGING THE WILD HORSE."
"我们大约在八点时，离开了野牛营地，辛苦而又疲惫地前进了两个小时，穿过了一座座小山，小山被参差不齐且稀稀拉拉的矮栎树林覆盖，也被深谷隔断。我发现在这些橡树中，有许多极矮的树，有些都不超过一英尺，却都结满了小小的橡栗。实际上，整个十字木林有许多橡树果实。这里有一种松橡树，它可以结出一种吃起来很甜美的橡栗，在这个季节的早些时候就已经成熟了。","We left the buffalo camp about eight o’clock, and had a toilsome and harassing march of two hours, over ridges of hills, covered with a ragged meagre forest of scrub-oaks, and broken by deep gullies.Among the oaks I observed many of the most diminutive size; some not above a foot high, yet bearing abundance of small acorns.The whole of the Cross Timber, in fact, abounds with mast.There is a pine-oak which produces an acorn pleasant to the taste, and ripening early in the season."
"大约在上午十点左右，我们来到了一条通往山谷的起伏山丘的路上，雷德河的北支流也穿过这个山谷。一片宽约半英里的美丽草地上，点缀着秋天黄灿灿的花朵。这草地沿着山脚一直延伸到两三英里之外，紧挨着河的对岸，河两岸则围着三角叶杨树。厌倦了棕色森林的单调和沉默之后，这些颜色鲜亮的树叶使人眼前一亮，令人愉悦不已。","About ten o’clock in the morning, we came to where this line of rugged hills swept down into a valley, through which flowed the north fork of the Red River.A beautiful meadow about half a mile wide, enamelled with yellow autumnal flowers, stretched for two or three miles along the foot of the hills, bordered on the opposite side by the river, whose banks were fringed with cottonwood trees, the bright foliage of which refreshed and delighted the eye, after being wearied by the contemplation of monotonous wastes of brown forest."
"这个草地上极好地布满了各种小树林和丛林，它们分布得错落有致，好像是人工布置的一样。当我们向这个清爽而又令人愉悦的山谷放眼望去时，看到右侧大约一英里处，有一群野马在一片绿色的草坪上安静地吃着草。而在我们左侧几乎同样远的地方有几头野牛，有的正在吃草，其余的则在一丛三角叶杨的树阴下，躺在又高又密的杂草中歇息、反刍。整个场面看上去就像是一位富裕农场主在其奢华产业中的一个广阔美丽的牧场，而他的牛正在草地上吃着草。","The meadow was finely diversified by groves and clumps of trees, so happily dispersed, that they seemed as if set out by the hand of art.As we cast our eyes over this fresh and delightful valley, we beheld a troop of wild horses, quietly grazing on a green lawn, about a mile distant to our right, while to our left, at nearly the same distance, were several buffaloes; some feeding, others reposing and ruminating among the high rich herbage, under the shade of a clump of cottonwood trees.The whole had the appearance of a broad beautiful tract of pasture land, on the highly ornamented estate of some gentleman farmer, with his cattle grazing about the lawns and meadows."
"一场关于作战的商议马上就展开了，我们决定要在眼前的这个绝佳机会中大捞一把，并试一试狩猎中常用的所谓包围野马的策略。这需要一大批骑术精湛的骑手。他们各自四散到不同方向上去，相互间隔一定的距离，然后慢慢地围成一个周长为两三公里的圈，以便包围猎物。这必须要做得非常小心，因为野马是大草原上最警觉的居住者，如果迎着风，它在很远处就可以闻到猎手的气息。","A council of war was now held, and it was determined to profit by the present favorable opportunity, and try our hand at the grand hunting manoeuvre, which is called ringing the wild horse.This requires a large party of horsemen, well mounted.They extend themselves in each direction, singly, at certain distances apart, and gradually form a ring of two or three miles in circumference, so as to surround the game.This has to be done with extreme care, for the wild horse is the most readily alarmed inhabitant of the prairie, and can scent a hunter at a great distance, if to windward."
"围成一个圈之后，两三个骑手策马奔向这些马，而它们则向反方向逃窜。然而，只要它们一接近包围圈的边界，都有一个猎手挺身而出，迫使它们折返回去。这样，它们在每一个点上都会受到阻拦和驱赶，只能围着这个有魔力的圈子不停地奔跑，直到精疲力尽。而这时，猎手就很容易把马骑到它们身旁，扔出套索套住它们的脑袋了。然而，速度最快、勇气最大、脚力最好的一流马匹还是容易突破包围逃走，所以被抓到的一般都是二流马。","The ring being formed, two or three ride toward the horses, who start off in an opposite direction.Whenever they approach the bounds of the ring, however, a huntsman presents himself and turns them from their course.In this way, they are checked and driven back at every point; and kept galloping round and round this magic circle, until, being completely tired down, it is easy for the hunters to ride up beside them, and throw the lariat over their heads.The prime horses of most speed, courage, and bottom, however, are apt to break through and escape, so that, in general, it is the second-rate horses that are taken."
"我们现在正准备抓这种马。驮马们都被带到了树林里，紧紧地拴在了树上，以防野马们奔跑的时候，它们会跟着一起逃窜。然后，一个中尉命令二十五个人沿着峡谷边缘，在山旁的狭长树林里悄悄前进。他们彼此相距大约五十码，埋伏在树林的边缘，直到马匹朝他们那个方向逃窜时，才前进或现身。二十五个人获令穿过山谷，以类似的方式沿着河对岸埋伏在树丛中。大约相同人数的第三支队伍，沿着山谷的下部一字排开，和两翼形成呼应之势。贝蒂和我们的另一个混血儿安托万，以及总是爱管闲事的托尼什，准备在丛林中绕一个圈，前往山谷的上部，到野马的背后，把它们赶进我们围成的这个口袋中，两翼的人则在后面支援，进而形成一个完整的围圈。","Preparations were now made for a hunt of the kind.The pack-horses were taken into the woods and firmly tied to trees, lest, in a rush of the wild horses, they should break away with them.Twenty-five men were then sent under the command of a lieutenant, to steal along the edge of the valley within the strip of wood that skirted the hills.They were to station themselves about fifty yards apart, within the edge of the woods, and not advance or show themselves until the horses dashed in that direction.Twenty-five men were sent across the valley, to steal in like manner along the river bank that bordered the opposite side, and to station themselves among the trees.A third party, of about the same number, was to form a line, stretching across the lower part of the valley, so as to connect the two wings.Beatte and our other half-breed, Antoine, together with the ever-officious Tonish, were to make a circuit through the woods so as to get to the upper part of the valley, in the rear of the horses, and to drive them forward into the kind of sack that we had formed, while the two wings should join behind them and make a complete circle."
"侧翼的队伍悄悄地分散开，隐藏在山谷的两侧。剩下的人则就地展开，就像一条横贯的锁链。此时，那些野马似乎闻到了敌人的味道，它们使劲吸着气，喷着鼻息四处张望。最后，它们慢慢地向河流跑去，消失在一片绿色的河岸之后。在此，我们便可以看到追逐的规则了——树林中的猎手挺身而出，不声不响地拦住它们，然后驱赶它们调头。然而，不幸的是，我们得先解决那如野火般不受控制的小个子法国人。当看到它们向河边跑去时，他没有安静地呆在山谷的右边等着野马过来，而是从隐蔽的树林中冲了出去，骑着伯爵的一匹备用马，穿过草地拼命地追赶它们。这使整个局面都崩溃了。所有的混血儿和十几个巡逻骑兵也加入了追逐的行列。他们都越过了绿色的河岸。不一会儿，野马们又出现了，它们飞奔下山谷，法国人、混血儿及巡逻骑兵都策马在它们后面高声鬼叫着。原本埋伏在山谷中，准备用来拦阻并把这些逃亡者驱赶回去的防线都毫无用处了。它们被追赶者追得太急了，所以惊慌地冲破防线，顺着草原奔了下去。整支队伍都加入了仓促的追逐之中。一些巡逻骑兵没了帽子，头发在耳边飞舞；另一些则把手帕系在了头上。那些在草地上静静反刍的大型野牛站了起来，惊讶地凝视了片刻草地上的这阵骚乱，然后扭过头，摆动着沉重的身躯开始逃跑。它们很快便被追上了。这两群动物由于山谷两边的收缩而被堵到了一起，它们都在匆忙而慌张地奔跑着。野牛、野马、狂野的猎人，牛蹄声、马蹄声、猎人的呐喊声，在树林中混成了一片。","The flanking parties were quietly extending themselves, out of sight, on each side of the valley, and the residue were stretching themselves, like the links of a chain, across it, when the wild horses gave signs that they scented an enemy; snuffing the air, snorting, and looking about.At length they pranced off slowly toward the river, and disappeared behind a green bank.Here, had the regulations of the chase been observed, they would have been quietly checked and turned back by the advance of a hunter from among the trees, unluckily, however, we had our wild-fire Jack-o’-lantern little Frenchman to deal with.Instead of keeping quietly up the right side of the valley, to get above the horses, the moment he saw them move toward the river, he broke out of the covert of woods, and dashed furiously across the plain in pursuit of them, being mounted on one of the led horses belonging to the Count.This put an end to all system.The half-breeds and half a score of rangers joined in the chase.Away they all went over the green bank; in a moment or two the wild horses reappeared, and came thundering down the valley, with Frenchman, half-breeds, and rangers galloping and yelling like devils behind them.It was in vain that the line drawn across the valley attempted to check and turn back the fugitives.They were too hotly pressed by their pursuers; in their panic they dashed through the line, and clattered down the plain.The whole troop joined in the headlong chase, some of the rangers without hats or caps, their hair flying about their ears, others with handkerchiefs tied round their heads.The buffaloes, who had been calmly ruminating among the herbage, heaved up their huge forms, gazed for a moment with astonishment at the tempest that came scouring down the meadow, then turned and took to heavy-rolling flight.They were soon overtaken; the promiscuous throng were pressed together by the contracting sides of the valley, and away they went, pell-mell, hurry-scurry, wild buffalo, wild horse, wild huntsman, with clang and clatter, and whoop and halloo, that made the forests ring."
"最终，野牛们跑进了一个岸边的灌木丛，而马儿们则冲进了一条山间的狭窄隘路，它们的追赶者紧随其后。贝蒂超过了其中几匹，他把目光锁定在一匹漂亮的波尼人的马上。它的耳朵上有裂口，背上有马鞍的痕迹。他拼命地追着它，却在树林中追丢了。在这些野马中，有一匹漂亮的黑色母马由于怀有小马而相当疲乏了。慌忙奔上隘路时，它被绊了一跤，摔倒在地上。一个年轻的巡逻骑兵从马上跳了下来，抓住了它的鬃毛和嘴巴。另一个巡逻骑兵也下了马，过来帮助他。这匹母马猛烈地挣扎着，又踢又咬，用前蹄防卫，但脑袋上被套上了一条套索后，挣扎也变得无济于事。然而，过了好长一段时间，它才停止了暴跳、猛窜，不再用蹄子四处踢打。于是，这两个巡逻骑兵用两根长长的套索牵着它在山谷中前进。这样，他们就能够在两侧与它保持足够远的距离，以免被它踢到，并且，它一朝着某一个方向冲过去，便会被另一个方向的人狠狠地拉回来。就这样，它的脾气渐渐缓和了。","At length the buffaloes turned into a green brake on the river bank, while the horses dashed up a narrow defile of the hills, with their pursuers close at their heels.Beatte passed several of them, having fixed his eye upon a fine Pawnee horse, that had his ears slit, and saddle-marks upon his back.He pressed him gallantly, but lost him in the woods.Among the wild horses was a fine black mare, far gone with foal.In scrambling up the defile, she tripped and fell.A young ranger sprang from his horse, and seized her by the mane and muzzle.Another ranger dismounted, and came to his assistance.The mare struggled fiercely, kicking and biting, and striking with her fore feet, but a noose was slipped over her head, and her struggles were in vain.It was some time, however, before she gave over rearing and plunging, and lashing out with her feet on every side.The two rangers then led her along the valley by two long lariats, which enabled them to keep at a sufficient distance on each side to be out of the reach of her hoofs, and whenever she struck out in one direction, she was jerked in the other.In this way her spirit was gradually subdued."
"至于爱虚张声势的小个子托尼什，由于他的轻率之举而毁了整个行动，但却得到了意料之外的收获——他抓住了一匹漂亮的乳白色的小马。这匹马大约有七个月大，所以没有力气跟上同伴。这个反复无常的小法国人已经欣喜若狂了。看到他和他的战利品让人感觉很搞笑。那匹小马又跳又踢，挣扎着想要逃跑，而托尼什则抱住它的脖子，和它扭作一团，然后跳上马背做出各种滑稽古怪的动作，就像是一只猴子和一只小猫在一起。然而，最让我感到惊讶的是，看到这些一直享受着大草原上无拘无束的自由的可怜动物们，一旦被抓到，便很快就屈服于人类的控制。接下来那两三天的行程中，那匹母马和小马同备用马一起前进，变得非常地驯服。","As to little Scaramouch Tonish, who had marred the whole scene by his precipitancy, he had been more successful than he deserved, having managed to catch a beautiful cream-colored colt, about seven months old, which had not strength to keep up with its companions, The mercurial little Frenchman was beside himself with exultation.It was amusing to see him with his prize.The colt would rear and kick, and struggle to get free, when Tonish would take him about the neck, wrestle with him, jump on his back, and cut as many antics as a monkey with a kitten.Nothing surprised me more, however, than to witness how soon these poor animals, thus taken from the unbounded freedom of the prairie, yielded to the dominion of man.In the course of two or three days the mare and colt went with the led horses, and became quite docile."

"重返旅程，我们涉过了雷德河的北支流，这是一条湍急的小河流，河水非常清澈，这在大草原上是很难看到的。很明显，它的源头在高地上，有充足的泉水供给。越过这条河之后，我们又开始攀登于山丘之间，在其中一座山上放眼望去，整个十字木林地区尽收眼底，但却是一幅凄凉的景象：山连着山，树林挨着树林，所有的事物都染着悲凉的赤褐色。偶尔，这儿或那儿会有一排绿色的三角叶杨、悬铃木或柳树点缀在山谷的小溪两旁。一队野牛正沿着远处一座小山的侧面慢慢往上爬，在这荒蛮之景中成了一大特色。向左侧望去，越过崎岖的山丘、峡谷和起伏的森林，便会看到大约十英里外有一个大草原，一直延伸到湛蓝的地平线上。就像是在礁石和浪花之间，远眺静谧的大海。不幸的是，我们的路线不是在那个方向上，我们还必须在这个沉闷的十字木林里前进几英里。","Resuming our march, we forded the North Fork, a rapid stream, and of a purity seldom to be found in the rivers of the prairies.It evidently had its sources in high land, well supplied with springs.After crossing the river, we again ascended among hills, from one of which we had an extensive view over this belt of cross timber, and a cheerless prospect it was; hill beyond hill, forest beyond forest, all of one sad russet hue—excepting that here and there a line of green cottonwood trees, sycamores, and willows, marked the course of some streamlet through a valley, A procession of buffaloes, moving slowly up the profile of one of those distant hills, formed a characteristic object in the savage scene.To the left, the eye stretched beyond this rugged wilderness of hills, and ravines, and ragged forests, to a prairie about ten miles off, extending in a clear blue line along the horizon.It was like looking from among rocks and breakers upon a distant tract of tranquil ocean.Unluckily, our route did not lie in that direction; we still had to traverse many a weary mile of the “cross timber.”"
"我们傍晚时在一个山谷中扎了营。这营地紧挨着一个几乎干涸的池塘，头上是一片稀稀拉拉的榆树，树枝上部不可思议地附着一簇簇槲寄生。晚上，那匹小野马不断地轻声嘶叫着。大约在黎明前两个小时，营地边缘突然传来了一阵动物惊跑乱窜的声音，或是马的奔跑声。马蹄声中还掺杂着鼻息声和嘶鸣声，大多数巡逻骑兵都被这声音惊醒了。他们静静地听着，直到这声音像一场刮过去的飓风，消失在远方。像往常一样，这噪声最先被认为是某个专门劫掠的印第安部族发出的，但等到天亮后，人们却发现邻近的一个草地上有几匹野马。人一靠近，它们就撒蹄跑开了。人们现在才知道是一群马在夜间奔过了我们营地。大家大体召集了一下马匹，发现有些分散到了相对较远的地方，还有几匹找不到了。然而，我们却看到它们的蹄印深陷在泥土中，这表明它们全速奔向了荒野。它们的主人沿着蹄印，疲惫不堪地出发去寻找它们。","We encamped toward evening in a valley, beside a scanty pool, under a scattered grove of elms, the upper branches of which wore fringed with tufts of the mystic mistletoe.In the course of the night, the wild colt whinnied repeatedly; and about two hours before day, there was a sudden stampedo, or rush of horses, along the purlieus of the camp, with a snorting and neighing, and clattering of hoofs, that startled most of the rangers from their sleep, who listened in silence, until the sound died away like the rushing of a blast.As usual, the noise was at first attributed to some party of marauding Indians, but as the day dawned, a couple of wild horses were seen in a neighboring meadow, which scoured off on being approached.It was now supposed that a gang of them had dashed through our camp in the night.A general mustering of our horses took place, many were found scattered to a considerable distance, and several were not to be found.The prints of their hoofs, however, appeared deeply dinted in the soil, leading off at full speed into the waste, and their owners, putting themselves on the trail, set off in weary search of them."
"黎明时天气晴朗，可是上午天又变得灰蒙蒙、低沉沉的，预示着一场秋季暴风雨的来临。我们安静而又严肃地重新踏上旅程，穿过一片崎岖而又阴郁的区域。从这里的最高点，我们可以看到无限向西延伸的大草原。行进了大约两三个小时之后，在穿越一片好似巨大的棕色荒原的枯萎草地时，我们看到远处有七个奥塞奇战士迎面而来。在这孤寂的荒野中看到任何人，都是一件有趣的事情，就像是在大海上和另一艘船联络。其中一个印第安人带领着他的同伴们，昂首挺胸、气宇非凡地向我们走来。他是一个英俊的小伙子，穿着猩红色的长外衣，绑着用鹿皮做的、流苏镶边的绑腿。他头上插着一根白色的羽毛，带着某种战士的气质向我们走来，一只手晃动着弓箭。","We had a ruddy daybreak, but the morning gathered up gray and lowering, with indications of an autumnal storm.We resumed our march silently and seriously, through a rough and cheerless country, from the highest points of which we could descry large prairies, stretching indefinitely westward.After travelling for two or three hours, as we were traversing a withered prairie, resembling a great brown heath, we beheld seven Osage warriors approaching at a distance.The sight of any human being in this lonely wilderness was interesting; it was like speaking a ship at sea.One of the Indians took the lead of his companions, and advanced toward us with head erect, chest thrown forward, and a free and noble mien.He was a fine-looking fellow, dressed in scarlet frock and fringed leggings of deer skin.His head was decorated with a white tuft, and he stepped forward with something of a martial air, swaying his bow and arrows in one hand."
"我们通过翻译贝蒂和他进行了一番交谈，得知他和他的同伴们一直在和他们部落的主力一起猎杀野牛，并且非常成功。他还告诉我们，在接下来的一天中，我们将会到达位于加拿大人大河河岸的大草原，还会发现大量的猎物。他又补充说，由于狩猎结束了，猎手们都在回家的路上，所以他和他的同伴们一起组成了一支远征队，去伏击一些波尼人的营地，希望能带回一些动物的头皮或马匹。","We held some conversation with him through our interpreter, Beatte, and found that he and his companions had been with the main part of their tribe hunting the buffalo, and had met with great success; and he informed us, that in the course of another day’s march, we would reach the prairies on the banks of the Grand Canadian, and find plenty of game.He added, that as their hunt was over, and the hunters on their return homeward, he and his comrades had set out on a war party, to waylay and hover about some Pawnee camp, in hopes of carrying off scalps or horses."
"到这时，他那些最初站在远处的同伴也走上前来加入了他。他们中有三个人带着普通的猎枪，其余的则配备着弓箭。当他们站着和我们的翻译交流，被一群巡逻骑兵包围着时，我不得不赞叹这些野蛮人漂亮的脸庞、宽阔的胸膛，以及优雅的态度和高尚的举止。我们试图让他们中的一个人加入我们，因为我们渴望看到他用弓箭捕杀野牛的场景。他最初似乎也想跟我们走，不过他的同伴们却劝他不要这么做。","By this time his companions, who at first stood aloof, joined him.Three of them had indifferent fowling-pieces; the rest were armed with bows and arrows.I could not but admire the finely shaped heads and busts of these savages, and their graceful attitude and expressive gestures, as they stood conversing with our interpreter, and surrounded by a cavalcade of rangers.We endeavored to get one of them to join us, as we were desirous of seeing him hunt the buffalo with his bow and arrow.He seemed at first inclined to do so, but was dissuaded by his companions."
"值得尊敬的专员这时记起了他作为调解员的使命。他进行了一番演说，劝他们放弃所有侵犯波尼人的行动，并告诉他们：他们在华盛顿的“父亲”计划停止他的红种孩子们之间的一切战争。他还向他们保证，他被派到这个边境上来是为了建立全面和平。因此，他让他们安安静静地回家，保证波尼人将不会再骚扰他们，反而很快就会把他们视为兄弟。","The worthy Commissioner now remembered his mission as pacificator, and made a speech, exhorting them to abstain from all offensive acts against the Pawnees; informing them of the plan of their father at Washington, to put an end to all war among his red children; and assuring them that he was sent to the frontier to establish a universal peace.He told them, therefore, to return quietly to their homes, with the certainty that the Pawnees would no longer molest them, but would soon regard them as brothers."
"这些印第安人以其惯有的沉默和庄重听着这场演说，之后，他们几个相互交谈了几句，然后便和我们告别，继续穿越大草原。","The Indians listened to the speech with their customary silence and decorum; after which, exchanging a few words among themselves, they bade us farewell, and pursued their way across the prairie."
"翻译贝蒂脸上隐隐的一丝笑容使我感到很好奇。于是，我私下里问他那些印第安人听了这场演说后，彼此说了些什么。他说，那个首领向他的同伴评论说，既然他们伟大的“父亲”想要这么快地停止一切战争，那么他们有必要充分利用留给他们的这一点儿时间。所以，他们以加倍的热情出发，去实施他们的盗马计划了！","Fancying that I saw a lurking smile in the countenance of our interpreter, Beatte, I privately inquired what the Indians had said to each other after hearing the speech.The leader, he said, had observed to his companions, that, as their great father intended so soon to put an end to all warfare, it behooved them to make the most of the little time that was left them.So they had departed, with redoubled zeal, to pursue their project of horse-stealing!"
"和那些印第安人分开后不久，我们便发现，在我们左侧的一个湿软山谷的灌木丛中有三头野牛。我和队长，以及几个巡逻骑兵一起去追赶它们。悄悄穿过一片难缠的小树林之后，带头的队长进到了射程以内，并从侧面打伤了其中的一头。它们三个都在惊慌之下拼命逃窜。穿过灌木丛、草丛、沼泽和泥潭，凭着它们巨大的体重，压倒了一切障碍物。很快，队长和巡逻骑兵便放弃了追逐，因为这有可能累垮他们的坐骑。然而，我却沿着受伤公牛的足迹追了下去，希望能够尽量靠近它，以便用上提供给我的唯一武器——手枪。但我还没来得及用，野牛就到了一个山石嶙峋、覆盖着星毛栎和刺藤的山丘脚下，并冲向前去，满含着愤怒一路冲撞了过去。在那儿，而只有疯子才会继续追下去。","We had not long parted from the Indians before we discovered three buffaloes among the thickets of a marshy valley to our left.I set off with the Captain and several rangers, in pursuit of them.Stealing through a straggling grove, the Captain, who took the lead, got within rifle-shot, and wounded one of them in the flank.They all three made of in headlong panic, through thickets and brushwood, and swamp and mire, bearing down every obstacle by their immense weight.The Captain and rangers soon gave up a chase which threatened to knock up their horses; I had got upon the traces of the wounded bull, however, and was in hopes of getting near enough to use my pistols, the only weapons with which I was provided; but before I could effect it, he reached the foot of a rocky hill, covered with post-oak and brambles, and plunged forward, dashing and crashing along, with neck or nothing fury, where it would have been madness to have followed him."
"这场追逐使我向一侧跑得非常远，我花了好长时间才重新找到队伍的踪迹。当我慢慢地攀爬一个小山的时候，一匹漂亮的黑色母马正绕着山顶腾跃，直到我离它非常近时，它才发现我。一看到我，它便立即开始后退，然后调头，全速跑进了山谷，然后跑上了对面的山丘。它的鬃毛和尾巴飞扬起来，如空气般行动自如。我一直凝视着它，直到它跑出了我的视野。我默默祈祷这样生机勃勃的动物永远不要成为鞭子和马勒下卑微的奴役，而是永远在大草原上自由地驰骋。","The chase had led me so far on one side, that it was some time before I regained the trail of our troop.As I was slowly ascending a hill, a fine black mare came prancing round the summit, and was close to me before she was aware.At sight of me she started back, then turning, swept at full speed down into the valley, and up the opposite hill, with flowing mane and tail, and action free as air.I gazed after her as long as she was in sight, and breathed a wish that so glorious an animal might never come under the degrading thraldom of whip and curb, but remain a free rover of the prairies."

"在追赶队伍时，我发现他们正在一个茂密的林地深处扎营，有一条小溪从中横穿而过，流淌于严重坍塌的河堤之间。在各个方向上不时传来步枪发出的清脆枪声，惊起了许多火鸡。它们或是在灌木丛中四散奔逃，或是飞到树上。我们才停留了一小会儿，蒙蒙的细雨便引来了那场酝酿已久的秋季暴风雨。我们立刻采取措施挡风遮雨：我们支起帐篷，将马鞍、马褡裢、装着咖啡、糖和盐的包裹，以及其他任何可能被雨水淋坏的东西堆放在帐篷下面。贝蒂、托尼什和安托万把带枝杈的木桩插到土里，把杆子横架在它们上面作为椽子，并覆以树皮和动物皮，以此搭起了一个棚屋，或者一个遮棚。倾斜的一面对着风，而敞开的一面对着火。那些巡逻骑兵用树皮和动物皮搭起了类似的棚屋，或者是把毯子撑开放在用带枝杈的木桩支撑的杆子上，并在前面生一大堆火。","On overtaking the troop, I found it encamping in a rich bottom of woodland, traversed by a small stream, running between deep crumbling banks.A sharp cracking off of rifles was kept up for some time in various directions, upon a numerous flock of turkeys, scampering among the thickets, or perched upon the trees.We had not been long at a halt, when a drizzling rain ushered in the autumnal storm that had been brewing.Preparations were immediately made to weather it; our tent was pitched, and our saddles, saddlebags, packages of coffee, sugar, salt, and every thing else that could be damaged by the rain, were gathered under its shelter.Our men, Beatte, Tonish, and Antoine, drove stakes with forked ends into the ground, laid poles across them for rafters, and thus made a shed or pent-house, covered with bark and skins, sloping toward the wind, and open toward the fire.The rangers formed similar shelters of bark and skins, or of blankets stretched on poles, supported by forked stakes, with great fires in front."
"这些预防措施非常及时。这场连绵的阴雨，时断时续地下了两天。我们刚刚到达时平静流淌的溪水，现在涨成了混沌翻滚的急流，而森林也差不多快变成沼泽地了。人们或是聚集在他们用动物皮和毯子搭建的棚屋下，或是蜷缩着围坐在篝火旁。几柱浓烟盘旋在树林间，在空气中慢慢散开，给这个林地笼上了一层蓝色的烟薄。我们那些可怜的、困顿的马儿们，因旅途劳顿及牧草短缺而被折磨坏了，无精打采地站在雨中，低着脑袋，耷拉着耳朵，喷着鼻息，眼睛半睁半闭地打着瞌睡。每一阵微风掠过树枝时，都会刮落一些枯黄的秋叶，飘散在它们周围。","These precautions were well timed.The rain set in sullenly and steadily, and kept on, with slight intermissions, for two days.The brook which flowed peacefully on our arrival, swelled into a turbid and boiling torrent, and the forest became little better than a mere swamp.The men gathered under their shelters of skins and blankets, or sat cowering round their fires; while columns of smoke curling up among the trees, and diffusing themselves in the air, spread a blue haze through the woodland.Our poor, way-worn horses, reduced by weary travel and scanty pasturage, lost all remaining spirit, and stood, with drooping heads, flagging ears, and half-closed eyes, dozing and steaming in the rain, while the yellow autumnal leaves, at every shaking of the breeze, came wavering down around them."
"然而，尽管天气很糟糕，我们的猎手们却没有闲着。在雨停的间歇，他们会骑马出去巡游整个林地。远方不时的尖锐枪声，预示着某一头鹿的死亡。大量的鹿肉被带了回来。一些人忙着在棚屋下给猎物剥皮，把肉切开，或是在篝火周围摆上烤肉叉和野营水壶，之后在整个营地里举行一种粗陋的宴会，更准确地说，是狼吞虎咽。一些人仍继续在挥动着斧子工作，单调的伐木声在林间回响。轰隆！某棵大树轰然倒下。几分钟之后，它的枝杈就会在营地巨大的篝火里熊熊燃烧，发出噼里啪啦声。而某个曾经在它的树阴下蹦跳的不幸的鹿，现在正在它上面烤着。","Notwithstanding the bad weather, however, our hunters were not idle, but during the intervals of the rain, sallied forth on horseback to prowl through the woodland.Every now and then the sharp report of a distant rifle boded the death of a deer.Venison in abundance was brought in.Some busied themselves under the sheds, flaying and cutting up the carcasses, or round the fires with spits and camp kettles, and a rude kind of feasting, or rather gormandizing, prevailed throughout the camp.The axe was continual at work, and wearied the forest with its echoes.Crash! some mighty tree would come down; in a few minutes its limbs would be blazing and crackling on the huge camp fires, with some luckless deer roasting before it, that had once sported beneath its shade."
"天气的变化可害苦了我们的小个子法国人。他那除了骨头就是筋的瘦弱身躯，此刻正遭受着风湿病痛的折磨。他牙疼、耳朵疼——他的脸紧绷着——几乎浑身上下哪儿都刺疼；可所有这些好像只会让他更加不安分，他在篝火旁坐立不安，他不停地烤肉、炖肉、呻吟、谩骂并诅咒。","The change of weather had taken sharp hold of our little Frenchman.His meagre frame, composed of bones and whip-cord, was racked with rheumatic pains and twinges.He had the toothache—the earache—his face was tied up—he had shooting pains in every limb; yet all seemed but to increase his restless activity, and he was in an incessant fidget about the fire, roasting, and stewing, and groaning, and scolding, and swearing."
"我们的贝蒂神情冷峻而又羞愧地打猎回来了。他碰到了一头体积庞大的熊，用步枪子弹打伤了它。这头熊奔向了那条水流满涨而又湍急的小溪。贝蒂随后就追了上去，用猎刀砍向它的臀部。每一次攻击时，这头熊都会狂怒地扑向他，并露出可怕的、白森森的牙齿。贝蒂在小溪中找到一个立足点之后，得以用步枪将它赶跑。当他连游带淌地跟着过了河，试图击倒它时，那头熊却成功地爬过一片灌木丛逃走了，于是贝蒂沮丧地放弃了追逐。","Our man Beatte returned grim and mortified, from hunting.He had come upon a bear of formidable dimensions, and wounded him with a rifle-shot.The bear took to the brook, which was swollen and rapid.Beatte dashed in after him and assailed him in the rear with his hunting-knife.At every blow the bear turned furiously upon him, with a terrific display of white teeth.Beatte, having a foothold in the brook, was enabled to push him off with his rifle, and, when he turned to swim, would flounder after, and attempt to hamstring him,the bear, however, succeeded in scrambling off among the thickets, and Beatte had to give up the chase."
"这次冒险虽没带回任何猎物，但至少在夜晚的火堆周围引发人们谈论了几件关于猎熊的轶事，而其中灰熊显然成了主角。无论是在印第安人还是在白种人中间，这种强悍凶猛的动物都是猎人的故事中最受欢迎的主题。它那巨大的爪子常被作为一种奖励戴在印第安勇士的脖子上，这可比人的头皮更加荣耀。现在除了在高地草原和落基山脉周围，人们几乎看不到灰熊。其他的熊在被打伤和激怒时，也会非常可怕，但在可以逃走的情况下，它们很少作战。在我们西部荒原的所有动物中，独有灰熊很容易就无缘无故产生敌意。它那庞大的体积和惊人的力气使它成为了一个令人恐惧的对手。尽管身中数枪并被猎刀砍伤多处，但它顽强的生命力仍让那些老练的猎手也束手无策。","This adventure, if it produced no game, brought up at least several anecdotes, round the evening fire, relative to bear hunting, in which the grizzly bear figured conspicuously.This powerful and ferocious animal is a favorite theme of hunter’s story, both among red and white men; and his enormous claws are worn round the neck of an Indian brave as a trophy more honorable than a human scalp.He is now scarcely seen below the upper prairies and the skirts of the Rocky Mountains.Other bears are formidable when wounded and provoked, but seldom make battle when allowed to escape.The grizzly bear alone, of all the animals of our Western wilds, is prone to unprovoked hostility.His prodigious size and strength make him a formidable opponent; and his great tenacity of life often baffles the skill of the hunter, notwithstanding repeated shots of the rifle, and wounds of the hunting-knife."
"一件有关这种情形的轶事，向我们展现了边疆猎手们司空见惯的险情和死里逃生的场景。一个猎手在追逐一头鹿时，掉进了其中一个漏斗形的深坑中。这是大草原上暴雨后的积水沉降形成的，被称作落水洞。让他感到无比惊恐的是：他在洞底碰到了一头巨大的灰熊。这个猛兽向他扑来，一场殊死搏斗由此展开。在搏斗中，这个可怜的猎手被严重撕伤、咬伤，一条腿和一只胳膊也被折断了。但他最终却成功地杀死了他凶残的对手。因为伤得太严重了，他根本不能移动，所以他一连数日都呆在洞底，靠着生的熊肉维持生命。在那段时间里，他任由伤口就那么敞着，让其慢慢地完全愈合。最终，他爬到了洞口，来到了广阔的大草原上。他费力地爬向一个由几乎干涸的小溪形成的沟壑。在那儿，他美美地喝了一顿水，这给他注入了新的活力。然后，他从一个水塘爬到另一个水塘，靠吃一些小鱼和小蛙维持生命。","One of the anecdotes related on this occasion, gave a picture of the accidents and hard shifts to which our frontier rovers are inured.A hunter, while in pursuit of a deer, fell into one of those deep funnel-shaped pits, formed on the prairies by the settling of the waters after heavy rains, and known by the name of sink-holes.To his great horror, he came in contact, at the bottom, with a huge grizzly bear.The monster grappled him; a deadly contest ensued, in which the poor hunter was severely torn and bitten, and had a leg and an arm broken, but succeeded in killing his rugged foe.For several days he remained at the bottom of the pit, too much crippled to move, and subsisting on the raw flesh of the bear, during which time he kept his wounds open, that they might heal gradually and effectually.He was at length enabled to scramble to the top of the pit, and so out upon the open prairie.With great difficulty he crawled to a ravine, formed by a stream, then nearly dry.Here he took a delicious draught of water, which infused new life into him; then dragging himself along from pool to pool, he supported himself by small fish and frogs."
"一天，他看到一匹狼在附近的大草原上捕杀了一头鹿。他马上从沟壑里爬了过去，赶走了那匹狼，躺在鹿的尸体旁，直到饱餐了好几顿，体力大大恢复了之后，他才离开。","One day he saw a wolf hunt down and kill a deer in the neighboring prairie.He immediately crawled forth from the ravine, drove off the wolf, and, lying down beside the carcass of the deer, remained there until he made several hearty meals, by which his strength was much recruited."
"回到那条沟壑后，他沿着小溪一路前进，直到它变成了一条小河。他顺着这条河漂流而下，直到来到它汇入密西西比河的地方。他刚好在河口处发现了一棵带杈的树，他费力地把它弄到水中，骑在上面，让自己漂荡在这条大河的滚滚水流之中。他用这种方法一路漂着，直到到达康瑟尔布拉夫斯要塞的对面。幸好他是白天到达的，否则他很可能漂过这个孤零零的要塞而不为人所知，消失在滚滚水流中。要塞里面的人发现了他之后，便派出一艘独木舟去解救他，他被带上岸时已经奄奄一息了。在那儿，他的伤很快便好了，但却留下了终生的残疾。","Returning to the ravine, he pursued the course of the brook, until it grew to be a considerable stream.Down this he floated, until he came to where it emptied into the Mississippi.Just at the mouth of the stream, he found a forked tree, which he launched with some difficulty, and, getting astride of it, committed himself to the current of the mighty river.In this way he floated along, until he arrived opposite the fort at Council Bluffs.Fortunately he arrived there in the daytime, otherwise he might have floated, unnoticed, past this solitary post, and perished in the idle waste of waters.Being descried from the fort, a canoe was sent to his relief, and he was brought to shore more dead than alive, where he soon recovered from his wounds, but remained maimed for life."
"贝蒂经历了一场和熊的搏斗之后，显得筋疲力尽、狼狈不堪。他在那条溪水中搞得浑身都湿透了，再加上最近天气的变化，他四肢风湿痛的老毛病又犯了。尽管他通常是个勇敢无畏、吃苦耐劳的家伙，这时他坐在篝火旁也难免垂头丧气，甚至抱怨一顿。尽管正处于人生的黄金时期，拥有强壮的身躯和看起来钢铁般结实的体格，他却自称自己仅有一副残躯。实际上，他是一个活生生的边陲野外生活之艰辛的纪念碑。他露出左胳膊，向我们展示了以前风湿发作后留下的扭曲和收缩了的肌肉。这是一种经常折磨印第安人的疾病。因为裸露于变化无常的天气中，他们并没有像许多人想象的那样，铸就了一副对季节的变化无动于衷的完美身躯。他浑身满是各种伤痕，有些是打猎时留下的，还有些是在印第安战场上留下的。有一次他从马上摔下来，摔断了右胳膊；还有一次他的坐骑和他一起摔倒，压断了他的左腿。","Our man Beatte had come out of his contest with the bear very much worsted and discomfited.His drenching in the brook, together with the recent change of weather, had brought on rheumatic pains in his limbs, to which he is subject.Though ordinarily a fellow of undaunted spirit, and above all hardship, yet he now sat down by the fire, gloomy and dejected, and for once gave way to repining.Though in the prime of life, and of a robust frame, and apparently iron constitution, yet, by his own account, he was little better than a mere wreck.He was, in fact, a living monument of the hardships of wild frontier life.Baring his left arm, he showed it warped and contracted by a former attack of rheumatism; a malady with which the Indians are often afflicted; for their exposure to the vicissitudes of the elements does not produce that perfect hardihood and insensibility to the changes of the seasons that many are apt to imagine.He bore the scars of various maims and bruises; some received in hunting, some in Indian warfare.His right arm had been broken by a fall from his horse; at another time his steed had fallen with him, and crushed his left leg."
"“我几乎所有骨头都断过，都找不到一块完好的地方了，”他说，“无论现在发生什么，我都毫不在乎了。”“但是，”停了一会儿之后他补充道，“尽管如此，无论如何也只有很强壮的家伙才能放倒我。”","“I am all broke to pieces and good for nothing,” said he; “I no care now what happen to me any more.”“However,” added he, after a moment’s pause, “for all that, it would take a pretty strong man to put me down, anyhow.”"
"了解了他所讲述的关于自己的各种细节后，我感觉到有必要对他进行一番评价。他居住在尼欧肖河畔的一个奥塞奇小村庄，或者是在奥塞奇部落附近。那里是由一个来自哈得孙河岸名叫雷夸的可敬传教士监管的。他努力教授这些野蛮人农耕的技术，把他们变成农夫和牧人。在边疆之旅的最近一次行程中，我拜访了雷夸管辖的那块农耕教区，觉得比起那些仅仅沿着边疆传教、布道的使团，他这样做更能给那些贫穷的印第安人带来实实在在的好处。","I drew from him various particulars concerning himself, which served to raise him in my estimation.His residence was on the Neosho, in an Osage hamlet or neighborhood, under the superintendence of a worthy missionary from the banks of the Hudson, by the name of Requa, who was endeavoring to instruct the savages in the art of agriculture, and to make husbandmen and herdsmen of them.I had visited this agricultural mission of Requa in the course of my recent tour along the frontier, and had considered it more likely to produce solid advantages to the poor Indians than any of the mere praying and preaching missions along the border."
"在那附近，皮埃尔·贝蒂有他自己的小农场、印第安妻子和混血儿孩子。他还帮助雷夸先生努力教化当地人，改善奥塞奇部落的居住条件。贝蒂从小就是一个天主教徒，对他信奉的宗教非常虔诚。他说，他不能和雷夸先生一起祷告，但却可以和他一起工作。他对有益于他的野蛮朋友和邻居的事情常常表现出极大的热情。实际上，尽管他父亲曾经是法国人，他自己也是在白人中长大的，但显然他有着更多印第安人的特点，内心也更向往他母亲的民族。当他向我谈及可怜的印第安人在与边疆粗暴的殖民者打交道时所遭受到的不公正待遇和侵犯时，当他讲述奥塞奇部落每况愈下、岌岌可危的处境，说人数锐减、士气瓦解、几乎忍气吞声地活在他们曾经像英雄般出入的土地上时，我看到他血脉贲张、鼻翼翕动，显得义愤填膺；但他会用一种强烈的印第安人自控方式努力将这种感情抑制住，并把它憋回到自己心中。","In this neighborhood, Pierre Beatte had his little farm, his Indian wife, and his half-breed children; and aided Mr. Requa in his endeavors to civilize the habits, and meliorate the condition of the Osage tribe.Beatte had been brought up a Catholic, and was inflexible in his religious faith; he could not pray with Mr. Requa, he said, but he could work with him, and he evinced a zeal for the good of his savage relations and neighbors.Indeed, though his father had been French, and he himself had been brought up in communion with the whites, he evidently was more of an Indian in his tastes, and his heart yearned toward his mother’s nation.When he talked to me of the wrongs and insults that the poor Indians suffered in their intercourse with the rough settlers on the frontiers; when he described the precarious and degraded state of the Osage tribe, diminished in numbers, broken in spirit, and almost living on sufferance in the land where they once figured so heroically, I could see his veins swell, and his nostrils distend with indignation; but he would check the feeling with a strong exertion of Indian self-command, and, in a manner, drive it back into his bosom."
"他毫不犹豫地讲述了一个他和他的奥塞奇族人，追逐、报复对他们犯下滔天罪行的一伙白人的故事。我发现在这场对决中，贝蒂表现得完全像个印第安人。","He did not hesitate to relate an instance wherein he had joined his kindred Osages, in pursuing and avenging themselves on a party of white men who had committed a flagrant outrage upon them; and I found, in the encounter that took place, Beatte had shown himself the complete Indian."
"他曾多次跟随奥塞奇亲戚和波尼人打仗。他还讲述了一场就发生在这片狩猎场边界上的小冲突，其中有好几个波尼人被杀死了。他说，在我们的旅程途中，应该会经过那儿附近，还可以看到被杀者未被掩埋的尸骨和头颅。队伍里的外科医生也参与了我们的谈话。当听到这个消息时，他马上竖起了耳朵。他带着几分颅相学家的味道，承诺如果贝蒂可以帮他弄来其中的一副头骨的话，他愿意给他丰厚的报酬。","He had more than once accompanied his Osage relations in their wars with the Pawnees, and related a skirmish which took place on the borders of these very hunting grounds, in which several Pawnees were killed.We should pass near the place, he said, in the course of our tour, and the unburied bones and skulls of the slain were still to be seen there.The surgeon of the troop, who was present at our conversation, pricked up his ears at this intelligence.He was something of a phrenologist, and offered Beatte a handsome reward if he would procure him one of the skulls."
"贝蒂目瞪口呆而又一脸严肃地看了他一会儿。","Beatte regarded him for a moment with a look of stern surprise."
"“不，”他最终说道，“这太不好了！”我足够勇敢——我不怕杀人。但还是让死者独自安息吧！","“No!” said he at length, “dat too bad!”I have heart strong enough—I no care kill, but let the dead alone!"
"他补充说道，有一次在和一群白人一起旅行时，他和一个医生睡在同一个帐篷里，发现在他的包裹里有一副波尼人的头骨。他马上离开了那个医生的帐篷，和他们分道扬镳了。“他试图哄骗我，”贝蒂说，“但我说不，我们必须分开——我不和这种人为伍。”","He added, that once in travelling with a party of white men, he had slept in the same tent with a doctor, and found that he had a Pawnee skull among his baggage: he at once renounced the doctor’s tent, and his fellowship.“He try to coax me,” said Beatte, “but I say no, we must part—I no keep such company.”"
"在他精神沮丧的片刻，他玩起了印第安人常玩的预测未来的迷信把戏。他用手撑着下巴，凝视着火堆，坐了好长一会儿。我发现，他的思绪漂荡回了他那坐落在尼欧肖河岸上的简陋的家。他说他确信当他回去时会发现某个家人病了或是死了：他的左眼在过去两天里总是跳个不停，这是一种预示着某种不幸的征兆。","In the temporary depression of his spirits, Beatte gave way to those superstitious forebodings to which Indians are prone.He had sat for some time, with his cheek upon his hand, gazing into the fire.I found his thoughts were wandering back to his humble home, on the banks of the Neosho; he was sure, he said, that he should find some one of his family ill, or dead, on his return: his left eye had twitched and twinkled for two days past; an omen which always boded some misfortune of the kind."
"就是这些琐碎的小事，被放大成征兆后，就可以动摇这些具有钢铁般意志的男人的灵魂。最最细微的神秘而凶险的征兆，就足以让一个猎手或是一个战士无心于自己的事业，或者使他满脑子都是对即将到来的不幸的忧虑。正是这种荒野中孤独而又野蛮的流浪者所惯有的迷信倾向，使得那些预言家和梦想家有了强大的影响力。","Such are the trivial circumstances which, when magnified into omens, will shake the souls of these men of iron.The least sign of mystic and sinister portent is sufficient to turn a hunter or a warrior from his course, or to fill his mind with apprehensions of impending evil.It is this superstitious propensity, common to the solitary and savage rovers of the wilderness, that gives such powerful influence to the prophet and the dreamer."
"贝蒂的大半辈子都与奥赛奇人生活在一起，而奥赛奇人仍在很大程度上保留着原始的迷信幻想和迷信仪式。他们都相信灵魂和身体分离后仍然会继续存在，并且会带有在世时所有的爱好和习惯。在贝蒂他家附近的一个奥塞奇村庄里，为首的一位战士失去了他唯一的孩子。那是一个漂亮的女孩，年龄还很小很小。她所有的玩物都和她葬在了一起。她最喜欢的小马也被杀了，埋在她旁边的墓穴里，这样她就有可能在幽冥之地骑着它了。","The Osages, with whom Beatte had passed much of his life, retain these superstitious fancies and rites in much of their original force.They all believe in the existence of the soul after its separation from the body, and that it carries with it all its mortal tastes and habitudes.At an Osage village in the neighborhood of Beatte, one of the chief warriors lost an only child, a beautiful girl, of a very tender age.All her playthings were buried with her.Her favorite little horse, also, was killed, and laid in the grave beside her, that she might have it to ride in the land of spirits."
"在这儿，我补充一个小故事，这是我在旅程中穿过贝蒂所在的村庄时听说的，它可以说明奥塞奇族人的迷信。一个奥塞奇的大部族，在一条名叫尼卡南萨的美丽的河流旁驻扎了一段时间。在他们中间有个年轻的猎手，他是这个部落最勇敢、最优雅的一名战士。他原本是要和一个奥塞奇女孩结婚的，这个女孩因为长得非常漂亮，被称作“草原之花”。这个年轻的猎手让她和她的亲戚在营地上住一段时间，自己前往圣路易斯，去处理猎物，并为新娘买回一些首饰。离开了几星期之后，他回到了尼卡南萨河岸。但却发现营地已经不见了，只有光秃秃的帐篷架子和熄灭了的篝火的痕迹，表明这是营地原本所在的地方。他看到，在远处有个女人坐在河边，似乎是在哭泣。那是他订了婚的新娘。他跑过去抱住她，但她却悲伤地闪开了。他担心至少是某种不幸降临到了这个营地。","I will here add a little story, which I picked up in the course of my tour through Beatte’s country, and which illustrates the superstitions of his Osage kindred.A large party of Osages had been encamped for some time on the borders of a fine stream, called the Nickanansa.Among them was a young hunter, one of the bravest and most graceful of the tribe, who was to be married to an Osage girl, who, for her beauty, was called the Flower of the Prairies.The young hunter left her for a time among her relatives in the encampment, and went to St. Louis, to dispose of the products of his hunting, and purchase ornaments for his bride.After an absence of some weeks, he returned to the banks of the Nickanansa, but the camp was no longer there; and the bare frames of the lodges and the brands of extinguished fires alone marked the place.At a distance he beheld a female seated, as if weeping, by the side of the stream.It was his affianced bride.He ran to embrace her, but she turned mournfully away.He dreaded lest some evil had befallen the camp."
"“我们的人去哪儿了？”他喊道。","“Where are our people?” cried he."
"“他们都去了瓦格拉什卡河岸。”","“They are gone to the banks of the Wagrushka.”"
"“那你一个人在这儿干什么？”","“And what art thou doing here alone?”"
"“等你。”","“Waiting for thee.”"
"“那让我们赶快去与我们在瓦格拉什卡河岸的族人会合吧。”","“Then let us hasten to join our people on the banks of the Wagrushka.”"
"他把包裹交给她让她拿着，并按照印第安人的风俗走在了前面。","He gave her his pack to carry, and walked ahead, according to the Indian custom."
"他们来到了一处地方，可以看到远处营地的炊烟从河边的林地中袅袅升起。这个女孩坐在了一棵树的脚下。“我们一起回去不合适，”她说，“我在这儿等着。”","They came to where the smoke of the distant camp was seen rising from the woody margin of the stream.The girl seated herself at the foot of a tree.“It is not proper for us to return together,” said she; “I will wait here.”"
"这个年轻的猎手独自前往营地，而迎接他的却是族人们阴郁的脸色。","The young hunter proceeded to the camp alone, and was received by his relations with gloomy countenances."
"“发生什么不幸的事情？”他说，“你们为什么全都这么难过呢？”","“What evil has happened,” said he, “that ye are all so sad?”"
"没有人回答他。","No one replied."
"他去找他最喜欢的姐姐，求她前去寻找他的新娘，把她带到营地里来。","He turned to his favorite sister, and bade her go forth, seek his bride, and conduct her to the camp."
"“哎呀！”她喊叫道。“我怎么去找她啊？”她死了好几天了。","“Alas!” cried she, “how shall I seek her?”She died a few days since."
"此刻，那个年轻女孩的亲戚们都围着他，痛哭流涕。但他却拒绝相信这个不幸的消息。“就在刚刚，”他喊道，“我还把她独自留下，她还好端端的。跟我来，我带你们去见她。”","The relations of the young girl now surrounded him, weeping and wailing; but he refused to believe the dismal tidings.“But a few moments since,” cried he, “I left her alone and in health; come with me, and I will conduct you to her,”"
"他把他们带到她坐的那棵树那儿，但她却不见了，而他的包裹则躺在地上。未婚妻死亡的事实给他的内心带来沉重的打击，他倒在地上死去了。","He led the way to the tree where she had seated herself, but she was no longer there, and his pack lay on the ground.The fatal truth struck him to the heart; he fell to the ground dead."
"我几乎是一字不差地将别人讲述给我的这个简单的故事讲述出来的。我听这个故事时，正躺在晚间营地的篝火旁，据说营地就驻扎在这个故事发生的鬼魅之河的河岸。","I give, this simple story almost in the words in which it was related to me, as I lay by the fire in an evening encampment on the banks of the haunted stream where it is said to have happened."

"——鹿的叫声——施了魔法的子弹","—DEER BLEATING.—MAGIC BALLS."
"第二天早上，那些留在上一个营地寻找失散的马匹的巡逻骑兵们和我们会合了。他们一路追踪，穿过灌木丛和其他障碍物，越过溪流，跑了很远，直到最终发现它们在一片大草原的边缘啃着牧草。它们一直头朝着要塞的方向，很明显它们在沿着回家的路吃着草，丝毫没有注意到突然降临到自己身上的大草原上那无限的自由。","On the following morning we were rejoined by the rangers who had remained at the last encampment, to seek for the stray horses.They had tracked them for a considerable distance through bush and brake, and across streams, until they found them cropping the herbage on the edge of a prairie.Their heads were in the direction of the fort, and they were evidently grazing their way homeward, heedless of the unbounded freedom of the prairie so suddenly laid open to them."
"中午时，天气依然晴朗。我发现混血儿和托尼什正在偷偷地商议着什么。结果是请求我们让托尼什离开几个小时，允许他加入他的同伴们的一场大规模突袭。我们反对说，托尼什受疼痛折磨得太厉害，不能参加这种活动。但他极度渴望参加这次秘密行动，所以当允许他去时，他似乎立刻忘记了周身的病痛。","About noon the weather held up, and I observed a mysterious consultation going on between our half-breeds and Tonish; it ended in a request that we would dispense with the services of the latter for a few hours, and permit him to join his comrades in a grand foray.We objected that Tonish was too much disabled by aches and pains for such an undertaking; but he was wild with eagerness for the mysterious enterprise, and, when permission was give him, seemed to forget all his ailments in an instant."
"他们三个很快便全副武装地骑到马背上了；肩上扛着步枪，头上扎着头巾，显然是准备策马狂奔。当他们经过营地不同的帐篷时，尽管骑在前面、沉默寡言的贝蒂不时地勒住马，回过头以一种责备的目光狠狠地瞪着小个子法国人，但虚荣的他仍忍不住向周围的人吹嘘他即将要去完成的使命。然而，让这个喋喋不休的托尼什表现得像个“印第安人”是很难的。","In a short time the trio were equipped and on horseback; with rifles on their shoulders and handkerchiefs twisted round their heads, evidently bound for a grand scamper.As they passed by the different lodges of the camp, the vainglorious little Frenchman could not help boasting to the right and left of the great things he was about to achieve; though the taciturn Beatte, who rode in advance would every now and then check his horse, and look back at him with an air of stern rebuke.It was hard, however, to make the loquacious Tonish play “Indian.”"
"有几个猎手同样也动身出去了。第一流的老林中人瑞安，下午很早便满载着猎物回来了。他猎杀了一头雄鹿和两头肥壮的雌鹿。当他站在战利品旁边时，一群巡逻骑兵把他团团围住，而我也凑上前去，发现他们正在讨论一种有时用于猎鹿的技巧的好处。这个技巧包括一种叫做“咩咩叫”的乐器，用来模仿幼鹿的叫声，以便引诱雌鹿跑进步枪的射程内。“咩咩叫”也有各种各样的，适用于无风或是有风的天气，可以模仿不同年龄的小鹿的叫声。被它们欺骗的可怜动物，由于担心自己的孩子，有时会跑到离猎人很近的地方。“我曾用‘咩咩叫’引诱一头雌鹿，”一个年轻的猎手说道，“直到它跑到与我只隔二十码的地方，几乎成了我的囊中之物。“我三次举起步枪，但却不忍心射击，因为这头可怜的雌鹿看起来如此地忧愁，使我有点儿心软了。我想到了我自己的妈妈，以及当我还是一个孩子的时候，她是如何整天为我担心的。所以，最终我高呼一声，把这头雌鹿吓得立刻跑出了步枪的射程。”","Several of the hunters, likewise, sallied forth, and the prime old woodman, Ryan, came back early in the afternoon, with ample spoil, having killed a buck and two fat does.I drew near to a group of rangers that had gathered round him as he stood by the spoil, and found they were discussing the merits of a stratagem sometimes used in deer hunting.This consists in imitating, with a small instrument called a bleat, the cry of the fawn, so as to lure the doe within reach of the rifle.There are bleats of various kinds, suited to calm or windy weather, and to the age of the fawn.The poor animal, deluded by them, in its anxiety about its young, will sometimes advance close up to the hunter.“I once bleated a doe,” said a young hunter, “until it came within twenty yards of me, and presented a sure mark.I levelled my rifle three times, but had not the heart to shoot, for the poor doe looked so wistfully, that it in a manner made my heart yearn.I thought of my own mother, and how anxious she used to be about me when I was a child; so to put an end to the matter, I gave a halloo, and started the doe out of rifle-shot in a moment.”"
"“你做的是正确的，”忠厚的老瑞安喊道，“就我而言，我从不用‘咩咩叫’引诱鹿。我曾和带着‘咩咩叫’的猎手们一起打猎，我让他们把‘咩咩叫’扔掉了。利用母亲对孩子的爱，是一种很卑鄙的手段。”","“And you did right,” cried honest old Ryan.“For my part, I never could bring myself to bleating deer.I’ve been with hunters who had bleats, and have made them throw them away.It is a rascally trick to take advantage of a mother’s love for her young.”"
"傍晚时，我们的三位“勇士”结束了秘密的偷袭，回来了。还没看到他们，托尼什的声音就已经使大家注意到他们回来了，因为他在扯着嗓门高喊，把整个营地的注意力都吸引了过去。他们马匹那迟缓的步态和大汗淋漓的腹部，表明它们经历了一场艰苦的奔驰。走到跟前时，我们发现它们浑身都挂满了肉，就像是一个屠夫的屠宰场。实际上，他们搜寻了延伸到森林之外的一整片大草原，而那里布满了成群的野牛。贝蒂在几天前和奥塞奇人的交谈中，就了解到了关于这个大草原及草原上的动物的信息。但他却一直保守着这个秘密，不让巡逻骑兵知道，这样他和他的同伴们便可以捷足先登了。如果托尼什不是在吹牛的话，他们本可以杀死几十头野牛，但他们猎杀了四头，就已经感到心满意足了。","Toward evening our three worthies returned from their mysterious foray.The tongue of Tonish gave notice of their approach long before they came in sight; for he was vociferating at the top of his lungs, and rousing the attention of the whole camp.The lagging gait and reeking flanks of their horses, gave evidence of hard riding; and, on nearer approach, we found them hung round with meat like a butcher’s shambles.In fact, they had been scouring an immense prairie that extended beyond the forest, and which was covered with herds of buffalo.Of this prairie, and the animals upon it, Beatte had received intelligence a few days before, in his conversation with the Osages, but had kept the information a secret from the rangers, that he and his comrades might have the first dash at the game.They had contented themselves with killing four; though, if Tonish might be believed, they might have slain them by scores."
"这些消息，以及他们带回来的野牛肉，使整个营地都欢喜雀跃起来。每个人都兴奋地期待着去那个大草原上猎杀野牛。托尼什再一次成了营地的圣人，他口若悬河地对围坐在篝火旁竖耳倾听的听众讲了足足一个小时。他现在比之前更能吹嘘自己作为射击能手的高超枪法了。他把自己在前半部分旅程中没有什么战绩，统统归咎于“运气不好”，或是“中邪了”。发现听众竟然轻易地相信了自己，于是，他又讲述了一个类似的故事，宣称是自己的遭遇，但显然是从他的奥塞奇亲戚那来听来的一个故事。","These tidings, and the buffalo meat brought home in evidence, spread exultation through the camp, and every one looked forward with joy to a buffalo hunt on the prairies.Tonish was again the oracle of the camp, and held forth by the hour to a knot of listeners, crouched round the fire, with their shoulders up to their ears.He was now more boastful than ever of his skill as a marksman.All his want of success in the early part of our march he attributed to being “out of luck,” if not “spell-bound;” and finding himself listened to with apparent credulity, gave an instance of the kind, which he declared had happened to himself, but which was evidently a tale picked up among his relations, the Osages."
"据他所说，有一天在打猎时，他看到从峡谷中跑出来一头白鹿，那时他大约十四岁。他爬过去准备射击，但却发现一头接一头的鹿跑了出来，直到一共来了七头，全部都是雪白雪白的。爬到足够近之后，他挑出其中一头，朝它开了枪，但却没起作用。那头鹿依旧平静地立在那儿。他装上弹药并再次射击，但又没打中。于是，他持续地射击目标，却不断地射失目标，直到所有的弹药都被用光了，鹿却依然毫发无伤。他怀着对自己原本高超的枪法十分绝望的心情回到了家，却得到了一位老奥塞奇猎人的安慰。他说这些白鹿都拥有魔法保护的生命，也只能被一种特殊的子弹杀死。","According to this account, when about fourteen years of age, as he was one day hunting, he saw a white deer come out from a ravine.Crawling near to get a shot, he beheld another and another come forth, until there were seven, all as white as snow.Having crept sufficiently near, he singled one out and fired, but without effect; the deer remained unfrightened.He loaded and fired again and missed.Thus he continued firing and missing until all his ammunition was expended, and the deer remained without a wound.He returned home despairing of his skill as a marksman, but was consoled by an old Osage hunter.These white deer, said he, have a charmed life, and can only be killed by bullets of a particular kind."
"这个老印第安人给托尼什铸了几颗子弹，但铸子弹时却不让他看，也不告诉他所需的原料及需要经过的神秘仪式。","The old Indian cast several balls for Tonish, but would not suffer him to be present on the occasion, nor inform him of the ingredients and mystic ceremonials."
"得到了这些子弹之后，托尼什再次出发去寻找白鹿，并成功地找到了它们。他先尝试着用普通的子弹，但却像以前一样没打中。然而，一颗施过魔法的子弹马上便把一头漂亮的雄鹿打倒在地了。于是，鹿群中其余的鹿便马上逃得无影无踪了，并且再也没有出现过。","Provided with these balls, Tonish again set out in quest of the white deer, and succeeded in finding them.He tried at first with ordinary balls, but missed as before.A magic ball, however, immediately brought a fine buck to the ground.Whereupon the rest of the herd immediately disappeared and were never seen again."
"40845.0——早上天气昏暗低沉，快到八点时，太阳挣扎着出来了，照亮了整片树林。行军号发出了准备出发的信号。现在营地陷入了一片忙乱、喧闹和欢乐的景象。有些人正在骂骂咧咧地追逐着自己的马匹，有些人正骑在光溜溜的马背上，驱赶着同伴的马匹。有些人正在拆除用来支撑湿漉漉的毛毯作避难所的杆子；还有些人正在打包所有能够带走的东西，并放在走过来的驮马的背上；而其余的人则在拆卸他们受潮的步枪，重新装上弹药，以为下一场狩猎做准备。","October 29th.—The morning opened gloomy and lowering; but toward eight o’clock the sun struggled forth and lighted up the forest, and the notes of the bugle gave signal to prepare for marching.Now began a scene of bustle, and clamor, and gayety.Some were scampering and brawling after their horses, some were riding in bare-backed, and driving in the horses of their comrades.Some were stripping the poles of the wet blankets that had served for shelters; others packing up with all possible dispatch, and loading the baggage horses as they arrived, while others were cracking off their damp rifles and charging them afresh, to be ready for the sport."
"大约十点钟时，我们开始了行程。我慢吞吞地跟在队伍的尾部，跟着大部队涉过浑浊的小溪，并列队穿过迷宫般的树林。我总是被落在后面，直到最后一名落伍者消失在树林中，远处的号角声也从耳际散去。于是，我得以看到荒原再次变得寂静、孤独。此时，我们上一个喧闹的营地呈现出一片被遗弃的、荒凉的景象。周围树林中的许多地方被践踏得一片泥泞。许多树都被放倒了，有些被砍得支离破碎，一些巨大的碎片散落在地上；帐篷杆子都被掀去了覆盖物；篝火的余烬旁，还残留着一些穿在木叉上的烤鹿肉和烤牛肉，上面有饥饿的猎手用刀子砍切过的痕迹；四周还散落着兽皮、羊角、鹿角、野牛和鹿的骨头、生的大块腿肉，以及未拔毛的火鸡——在猎物丰富的地方，年轻的猎手就是很容易犯这种胡乱挥霍浪费的毛病。同时，二十来只甚至是四十来只红头美洲鹫早就在空中挥动着翅膀，准备一旦营地被抛弃就马上俯冲到营地来。","About ten o’clock, we began our march.I loitered in the rear of the troop as it forded the turbid brook, and defiled through the labyrinths of the forest.I always felt disposed to linger until the last straggler disappeared among the trees and the distant note of the bugle died upon the ear, that I might behold the wilderness relapsing into silence and solitude.In the present instance, the deserted scene of our late bustling encampment had a forlorn and desolate appearance.The surrounding forest had been in many places trampled into a quagmire.Trees felled and partly hewn in pieces, and scattered in huge fragments; tent-poles stripped of their covering; smouldering fires, with great morsels of roasted venison and buffalo meat, standing in wooden spits before them, hacked and slashed by the knives of hungry hunters; while around were strewed the hides, the horns, the antlers, and bones of buffaloes and deer, with uncooked joints, and unplucked turkeys, left behind with that reckless improvidence and wastefulness which young hunters are apt to indulge when in a neighborhood where game abounds.In the meantime a score or two of turkey-buzzards, or vultures, were already on the wing, wheeling their magnificent flight high in the air, and preparing for a descent upon the camp as soon as it should be abandoned."
"第二十九章 广阔的大草原","CHAPTER XXIX. THE GRAND PRAIRIE."
"——捕猎野牛","—A BUFFALO HUNT."
"向南前进了大约两个小时之后，我们终于在接近正午时走出了沉闷的十字木林。让我们感到无比高兴的是，我们看到“广阔的大草原”向我们的左右两边延伸出去。我们可以根据河岸上的绿色森林带明显地辨别出蜿蜒而辽阔的加拿大人河，以及许多较小的河流。整幅风景既广阔又美丽。看到这无边无际的富饶原野，人总会感到心境开阔，而对我这个刚从“密林之牢”逃离的人来说，这种感觉更加强烈。","After proceeding about two hours in a southerly direction, we emerged toward mid-day from the dreary belt of the Cross Timber, and to our infinite delight beheld “the great Prairie” stretching to the right and left before us.We could distinctly trace the meandering course of the main Canadian, and various smaller streams, by the strips of green forest that bordered them.The landscape was vast and beautiful.There is always an expansion of feeling in looking upon these boundless and fertile wastes; but I was doubly conscious of it after emerging from our “close dungeon of innumerous boughs.”"
"从一个高地上，贝蒂指出了他和他的同伴猎杀野牛的地方。我们还发现远处有几个黑色的物体在移动，他说那是牛群的一部分。队长决定改变行程，前往距此大约一英里的一个林木茂盛的低洼地，在那儿驻扎一两天，进行一次常规的野牛捕杀行动，以补给食物。当整支队伍排成一队沿着山坡向驻扎地前进时，贝蒂向我和我的伙伴们提议，让我们跟着他走，并承诺把我们带到可以好好消遣的地方。因此，我们离开了大部队，沿着另一个方向前往大草原。我们穿过一个小峡谷，爬上一个坡度平缓的高地。到达山顶时，我们看到大约一英里外有一群野马。贝蒂马上注意到了它们，将猎杀野牛的事抛到了九霄云外。他骑着那匹强壮的半野的马，马鞍的前鞍桥上挂着一个套索，拍马去追了；而我们则继续待在一个高地上，非常关切地注视着他的行动。借助着一条狭长的林地，他偷偷地前进，希望在被发现之前靠近它们。它们发现他后，便马上四散逃开了。我们看到他沿着地平线飞奔着，就像是一艘全速追逐商船的私掠船。最终，他越过了一个山脊，进入一个浅浅的山谷。一会儿之后，他出现在对面的山上，迫近了马群中的一匹。他很快便与它齐头并进，似乎在努力想套住猎物。但他们又一同消失在山下，我们再也看不到他们了。原来，他套住了一匹强壮的马，却没法控制它，在试图控制它时还弄掉了套索。","From a rising ground Beatte pointed out the place where he and his comrades had killed the buffaloes; and we beheld several black objects moving in the distance, which he said were part of the herd.The Captain determined to shape his course to a woody bottom about a mile distant, and to encamp there for a day or two, by way of having a regular buffalo hunt, and getting a supply of provisions.As the troop defiled along the slope of the hill toward the camping ground, Beatte proposed to my messmates and myself, that we should put ourselves under his guidance, promising to take us where we should have plenty of sport.Leaving the line of march, therefore, we diverged toward the prairie; traversing a small valley, and ascending a gentle swell of land.As we reached the summit, we beheld a gang of wild horses about a mile off.Beatte was immediately on the alert, and no longer thought of Buffalo hunting.He was mounted on his powerful half-wild horse, with a lariat coiled at the saddle-bow, and set off in pursuit; while we remained on a rising ground watching his manoeuvres with great solicitude.Taking advantage of a strip of woodland, he stole quietly along, so as to get close to them before he was perceived.The moment they caught sight of him a grand scamper took place.We watched him skirting along the horizon like a privateer in full chase of a merchantman; at length he passed over the brow of a ridge, and down into a shallow valley; in a few moments he was on the opposite hill, and close upon one of the horses.He was soon head and head, and appeared to be trying to noose his prey; but they both disappeared again below the hill, and we saw no more of them.It turned out afterward that he had noosed a powerful horse, but could not hold him, and had lost his lariat in the attempt."
"等他回来期间，我们看到两头野牛跑下一个山坡，奔向一条河流。这条河流曲折穿过了一个树木葱郁的溪谷。我和年轻的伯爵试图在树木的掩护下靠近它们。当距离它们尚有三四百码远时，它们便发现了我们，于是调头退回了高地。我们策马穿过溪谷，去追逐它们。那沉重的头和肩膀，使野牛跑上山时很费力，但这也加快了它们下山时的速度。因此，我们便具有了优势。尽管因为这些逃亡者身上特殊的气息使我们的马匹不敢接近，但我们还是很快逼近了它们。伯爵带着一支装满弹药的双管枪，他开了枪，却没有打中。那些公牛此刻改变了方向：狂奔下山。由于它们向着不同的方向逃窜，我们便也单个儿分头行动。我带着的是一对在吉布森要塞借的老式铜管手枪，可以明显地看出它们已经身经数战了。如果猎手可以骑马接近野牛，并在全速前进中向它开枪射击，手枪对于捕杀野牛是非常有效的。然而，常用于边陲地区的、又长又重的步枪则不容易操纵，也不易在马背上瞄准射击。因此，我的目标便是让野牛进入手枪的射程内。这并不是一件非常容易的事。我稳稳地骑在一匹有着出色速度和健美臀部的马上，它似乎也对这场追逐非常兴奋。我们很快赶上了猎物。但每当马上就要和它们平行时，它便会匆忙避向一旁，两只耳朵呈叉状向前竖起，露出厌恶和警觉的神色。这并不奇怪。在所有的动物中，野牛在猎手的紧追之下，会露出最最凶暴的神色。它那布满蓬乱毛发的庞大躯体上，拱着两只弯曲的黑色短牛角；眼睛像煤一样闪着幽光；嘴巴张着，露出干燥的半月形舌头；它那一簇直立的尾巴在空中飞舞着——它简直就是一幅愤怒和恐惧交织的完美景象。","While we were waiting for his return, we perceived two buffalo bulls descending a slope, toward a stream, which wound through a ravine fringed with trees.The young Count and myself endeavored to get near them under covert of the trees.They discovered us while we were yet three or four hundred yards off, and turning about, retreated up the rising ground.We urged our horses across the ravine, and gave chase.The immense weight of head and shoulders causes the buffalo to labor heavily up hill; but it accelerates his descent.We had the advantage, therefore, and gained rapidly upon the fugitives, though it was difficult to get our horses to approach them, their very scent inspiring them with terror.The Count, who had a double-barrelled gun loaded with ball, fired, but it missed.The bulls now altered their course, and galloped down hill with headlong rapidity.As they ran in different directions, we each singled out one and separated.I was provided with a brace of veteran brass-barrelled pistols, which I had borrowed at Fort Gibson, and which had evidently seen some service.Pistols are very effective in buffalo hunting, as the hunter can ride up close to the animal, and fire at it while at full speed; whereas the long heavy rifles used on the frontier, cannot be easily managed, nor discharged with accurate aim from horseback.My object, therefore, was to get within pistol shot of the buffalo.This was no very easy matter.I was well mounted on a horse of excellent speed and bottom, that seemed eager for the chase, and soon overtook the game; but the moment he came nearly parallel, he would keep sheering off, with ears forked and pricked forward, and every symptom of aversion and alarm.It was no wonder.Of all animals, a buffalo, when close pressed by the hunter, has an aspect the most diabolical.His two short black horns, curve out of a huge frontier of shaggy hair; his eyes glow like coals; his mouth is open, his tongue parched and drawn up into a half crescent; his tail is erect, and tufted and whisking about in the air, he is a perfect picture of mingled rage and terror."
"我好不容易驱马来到足够近的地方，然后瞄准射击，可让我懊恼的是，两把枪都没打中目标。不幸的是，这些老爷枪的保险栓都磨损过度了，所以在飞奔过程中，火药从火药池中被摇晃了出来。打完最后一枪后，我已经逼近野牛了。这时，在绝望之下，它突然掉头，喷着鼻息向我猛扑过来。我的马被惊得扬起前踢，在原地旋转了半圈，猛地跳开了。由于我双手举着枪，身体重心侧在马的一边，险些被抛到野牛的脚蹄之下。","It was with difficulty I urged my horse sufficiently near, when, taking aim, to my chagrin, both pistols missed fire.Unfortunately the locks of these veteran weapons were so much worn, that in the gallop, the priming had been shaken out of the pans.At the snapping of the last pistol I was close upon the buffalo, when, in his despair, he turned round with a sudden snort and rushed upon me.My horse wheeled about as if on a pivot, made a convulsive spring, and, as I had been leaning on one side with pistol extended, I came near being thrown at the feet of the buffalo."
"马跳跃了三四下，使我们摆脱了敌人的威胁。而仅仅是为了自卫而不顾一切扑过来的野牛，又马上开始逃跑了。拢住我那惊魂未定的坐骑，给手枪重新填上弹药之后，我立刻又策马追赶那头野牛，而它也放慢了速度好喘口气。当我靠近时，它又开始全力狂奔，沉重的身体一起一伏，全速冲过了灌木丛和溪谷。它那沉重的脚步声，惊动了几只躲藏在隐蔽处的鹿和狼，吓得它们慌忙穿过荒野，四散逃跑。","Three or four bounds of the horse carried us out of the reach of the enemy; who, having merely turned in desperate self-defence, quickly resumed his flight.As soon as I could gather in my panic-stricken horse, and prime the pistols afresh, I again spurred in pursuit of the buffalo, who had slackened his speed to take breath.On my approach he again set off full tilt, heaving himself forward with a heavy rolling gallop, dashing with headlong precipitation through brakes and ravines, while several deer and wolves, startled from their coverts by his thundering career, ran helter-skelter to right and left across the waste."
"穿过大草原全速追逐猎物，绝不像人们想象的那样是一件容易的事。人们只会想到广阔而又平坦的草原。确实，高草原上的狩猎场，不会像低草原那样，有那么多难缠的开花植物及长长的牧草，而主要覆盖着较短的野牛草。但其上也有着不少山丘和溪谷，到处都可能被雨后洪流冲成的较深的裂隙和沟壑所隔断；这些平坦表面下的裂隙几乎成了猎人行进中的陷阱，在他们全速奔驰时，突然挡住他们，或者是给他们带来肢体或生命的危害。平原上也有着许多小动物挖的洞，马蹄很容易深陷进去，把自己和骑手都摔倒。上一场雨覆盖了这个大草原的许多地区，原本坚硬的地面上积起了一层薄薄的水，马跑过时会溅起一路水花。其他的地方还会有无数的浅坑，直径大约八到十英尺，这是那些野牛像猪那样在沙地和泥地里打滚造成的。这些坑都注满了水，像镜子一样闪烁着，所以马要不断地越过它们或是从旁边绕行。我们也来到了大草原中难走的地区，到处都被裂缝和沟壑所隔断。野牛为了逃生，丝毫不注意脚下的路。它无暇沿着沟壑的边缘寻找一条更安全的路，而是直接就顺着极陡的坡道俯冲了下去。最终，我们来到了一条横跨整个大草原的很深的裂隙旁。这裂隙是由一条冬河冲刷而成的，嶙峋的岩石裸露在外面，形成了一条长长的峡谷，两旁是岩石和泥土混杂的、正掉着碎屑的陡峭悬崖。野牛从其中的一个悬崖，连跳带摔地俯冲了下去，然后沿着谷底一路疾奔。我看到没有继续追的必要，便停了下来，在悬崖边上静静地凝视着它，直到它消失在蜿蜒曲折的沟壑之间。","A gallop across the prairies in pursuit of game is by no means so smooth a career as those may imagine, who have only the idea of an open level plain.It is true, the prairies of the hunting ground are not so much entangled with flowering plants and long herbage as the lower prairies, and are principally covered with short buffalo grass; but they are diversified by hill and dale, and whore most level, are apt to be cut up by deep rifts and ravines, made by torrents after rains; and which yawning from an even surface are almost like pitfalls in the way of the hunger, checking him suddenly, when in full career, or subjecting him to the risk of limb and life.The plains, too, are beset by burrowing holes of small animals, in which the horse is apt to sink to the fetlock, and throw both himself and his rider.The late rain had covered some parts of the prairie, where the ground was hard, with a thin sheet of water, through which the horse had to splash his way.In other parts there were innumerable shallow hollows, eight or ten feet in diameter, made by the buffaloes, who wallow in sand and mud like swine.These being filled with water, shone like mirrors, so that the horse was continually leaping over them or springing on one side.We had reached, too, a rough part of the prairie, very much broken and cut up; the buffalo, who was running for life, took no heed to his course, plunging down break-neck ravines, where it was necessary to skirt the borders in search of a safer descent.At length we came to where a winter stream had torn a deep chasm across the whole prairie, leaving open jagged rocks, and forming a long glen bordered by steep crumbling cliffs of mingled stone and clay.Down one of these the buffalo flung himself, half tumbling, half leaping, and then scuttled along the bottom; while I, seeing all further pursuit useless, pulled up, and gazed quietly after him from the border of the cliff, until he disappeared amidst the windings of the ravine."
"现在没有什么可留恋的了，于是我调转马头，去和同伴们汇合。开始时，这有点儿困难。追逐野牛的热情，让我不辨东西地飞奔了很长一段距离。现在，我发现自己处在一片孤零零的荒野之中，四周是此起彼伏的清一色光秃秃的大地。由于没有路标和明显的特征，一个没有经验的人或许会不知所措，很容易像在茫茫大海中那样迷了路。今天又是一个阴天，无法靠太阳辨别方向。唯一的方法便是沿着我的马来时的脚印往回走，但是在那些草皮被烘干的地方，我经常找不到马蹄印。","Nothing now remained but to turn my steed and rejoin my companions.Here at first was some little difficulty.The ardor of the chase had betrayed me into a long, heedless gallop.I now found myself in the midst of a lonely waste, in which the prospect was bounded by undulating swells of land, naked and uniform, where, from the deficiency of landmarks and distinct features, an inexperienced man may become bewildered, and lose his way as readily as in the wastes of the ocean.The day, too, was overcast, so that I could not guide myself by the sun; my only mode was to retrace the track my horse had made in coming, though this I would often lose sight of, where the ground was covered with parched herbage."
"对一个不熟悉大草原的人来说，独自在大草原上会有一种难以言喻的孤独感。与之相比，森林里的孤独感便算不了什么了。在那儿，视野被树木遮挡住了，只留下自由的想象力去勾勒外面更加生气勃勃的场景。但在这儿，放眼望去，茫茫无际的景色里没有一个人影。在这儿会有一种远远超越人类居住界限的感觉，感到自己好像是在一个荒芜的世界中行进。当马儿沿着之前奔驰过的地方慢慢往回走，追逐的兴奋劲消逝之后，我对这些情形的感觉特别强烈。荒野上的寂静不时被远方一群塘鹅的叫声打破，它们像幽灵一般沿着一个浅浅的水塘走动着。有时还会听到空中乌鸦不祥的叫声，偶尔还会有一匹恶狼从我的眼前急促奔过，等达到了安全的距离之后，它便会坐下来仰天哀嚎，这凄厉的叫声给周围孤寂的荒野更增添了几分悲凉。","To one unaccustomed to it, there is something inexpressibly lonely in the solitude of a prairie.The loneliness of a forest seems noting to it.There the view is shut in by trees, and the imagination is left free to picture some livelier scene beyond.But here we have an immense extent of landscape without a sign of human existence.We have the consciousness of being far, far beyond the bounds of human habitation; we feel as if moving in the midst of a desert world.As my horse lagged slowly back over the scenes of our late scamper, and the delirium of the chase had passed away, I was peculiarly sensible to these circumstances.The silence of the waste was now and then broken by the cry of a distant flock of pelicans, stalking like spectres about a shallow pool; sometimes by the sinister croaking of a raven in the air, while occasionally a scoundrel wolf would scour off from before me: and, having attained a safe distance, would sit down and howl and whine with tones that gave a dreariness to the surrounding solitude."
"前进了一段时间之后，我看到远处一座小山的边缘有一个骑手，很快认出那人就是伯爵。他也和我一样一无所获。我们很快便和我们那知名的伙伴——那个艺术大师汇合了。他鼻梁上架着一副眼镜，在马背上射了两三枪，但什么也没打中。","After pursuing my way for some time, I descried a horseman on the edge of a distant hill, and soon recognized him to be the Count.He had been equally unsuccessful with myself; we were shortly after rejoined by our worthy comrade, the Virtuoso, who, with spectacles on nose, had made two or three ineffectual shots from horseback."
"我们决定再努力一次之后，才去寻找营地。放眼环顾周围的荒野，我们看到大约两英里处有一群散落的野牛，它们安静地在一片小树林和灌木丛旁边吃着草。人们很容易就会把它们想象成一群在公用牧地边上吃草的家养牛，这些树林可能还遮蔽了某个低矮的农舍。","We determined not to seek the camp until we had made one more effort.Casting our eyes about the surrounding waste, we descried a herd of buffalo about two miles distant, scattered apart, and quietly grazing near a small strip of trees and bushes.It required but little stretch of fancy to picture them so many cattle grazing on the edge of a common, and that the grove might shelter some lowly farmhouse."
"我们现在计划包围这群野牛。我们决定绕到它们的另一侧，把它们朝我们所知的营地驻扎的方向赶。否则，这场追逐有可能把我们带得非常远，让我们没法在黄昏前返回营地。因此，我们小心翼翼地蹑足缓行。偶尔看到牛群中任何一头停止吃草，便马上止住脚步。幸运的是，风从它们那个方向吹来，否则，它们可能早已嗅到我们的气息，警觉起来了。就这样，我们成功地包围了这群野牛，而没有惊动它们。这群野牛大约共有四十头；公牛、母牛和小牛都有。分散开一定距离之后，我们便开始平行地慢慢向它们靠近，希望可以在不被发现的情况下，偷偷靠近些。然而，它们开始慢慢离开，每走一两步就停下来吃口草。这时，一头之前没被我们发现、躺在我们左侧的树丛下午睡的公牛突然从它的隐藏处站了起来，飞奔着加入了它的同伴。我们还离得相当远，但猎物已经被惊动了。我们加快了脚步，它们也猛然狂奔起来，于是开始了一场全速的追逐。","We now formed our plan to circumvent the herd, and by getting on the other side of them, to hunt them in the direction where we knew our camp to be situated: otherwise the pursuit might take us to such a distance as to render it impossible to find our way back before nightfall.Taking a wide circuit, therefore, we moved slowly and cautiously, pausing occasionally, when we saw any of the herd desist from grazing.The wind fortunately set from them, otherwise they might have scented us and have taken the alarm.In this way we succeeded in getting round the herd without disturbing it.It consisted of about forty head, bulls, cows, and calves.Separating to some distance from each other, we now approached slowly in a parallel line, hoping by degrees to steal near without exciting attention.They began, however, to move off quietly, stopping at every step or two to graze, when suddenly a bull that, unobserved by us, had been taking his siesta under a clump of trees to our left, roused himself from his lair, and hastened to join his companions.We were still at a considerable distance, but the game had taken the alarm.We quickened our pace, they broke into a gallop, and now commenced a full chase."
"由于地势平坦，它们跑起来非常快，彼此摩肩接踵地跑成了一列。殿后的是两三头公牛，而其中的最后一头，从它那庞大的体积、端庄的前额和黝黑的皮毛看来，俨然是这群牛中的族长，它似乎已经作为君王，统治了这大草原很长时间了。","As the ground was level, they shouldered along with great speed, following each other in a line; two or three bulls bringing up the rear, the last of whom, from his enormous size and venerable frontlet, and beard of sunburnt hair, looked like the patriarch of the herd; and as if he might long have reigned the monarch of the prairie."
"这些庞大的动物看上去既可怕又滑稽：它们拖着巨大的身躯跑着，笨重的头和肩膀起伏不定；它们的尾巴竖着，就像是哑剧中的一排丑角，末端猛烈而又古怪地舞动着；而眼睛则恶狠狠地瞪着，流露出惊骇和愤怒的神色。","There is a mixture of the awful and the comic in the look of these huge animals, as they bear their great bulk forward, with an up and down motion of the unwieldy head and shoulders; their tail cocked up like the queue of Pantaloon in a pantomime, the end whisking about in a fierce yet whimsical style, and their eyes glaring venomously with an expression of fright and fury."
"有时，我会和它们平行前进，但却不能使马跑进手枪的射程中。因为在前一次追逐时，它被那头野牛的攻击吓坏了。最终，我成功了。但希望还是落空了，我的手枪又一次没能射中目标。我的同伴们，则因他们的马脚力稍逊，行路过多而更加疲惫，而不能赶上这群牛。最终，跟在牛群后面的L.先生放弃了追赶，他举起双管枪，瞄准目标长距离地扫射。子弹正好打中了一头野牛的腰部上方，打断了它的脊梁骨，使它倒在了地上。他停下来下马杀猎物，而我则借了他那还有一发子弹的枪，策马全速奔跑，又一次赶上了伯爵正在追逐的、一路逃窜发出巨响的牛群。手持现在的武器，我便没有必要驱动坐骑跑到那么近的地方了。因此，我一边和它们并行奔跑，一边瞄准了一头野牛，幸运地打中它之后，它便立刻倒在了地上。那颗子弹打中了野牛身上一个致命的部位。它没法从跌倒的地方移动半步，只好躺在那儿痛苦地挣扎着，而其他野牛则继续在大草原上拼命逃窜。","For some time I kept parallel with the line, without being able to force my horse within pistol shot, so much had he been alarmed by the assault of the buffalo in the preceding chase.At length I succeeded, but was again balked by my pistols missing fire.My companions, whose horses were less fleet, and more way-worn, could not overtake the herd; at length Mr. L., who was in the rear of the line, and losing ground, levelled his double-barrelled gun, and fired a long raking shot.It struck a buffalo just above the loins, broke its back-bone, and brought it to the ground.He stopped and alighted to dispatch his prey, when borrowing his gun, which had yet a charge remaining in it, I put my horse to his speed, again overtook the herd which was thundering along, pursued by the Count.With my present weapon there was no need of urging my horse to such close quarters; galloping along parallel, therefore, I singled out a buffalo, and by a fortunate shot brought it down on the spot.The ball had struck a vital part; it could not move from the place where it fell, but lay there struggling in mortal agony, while the rest of the herd kept on their headlong career across the prairie."
"我下了马，把它拴住，以防止其走失，然后走上前去观察猎物。我不是一个爱好运动的人，是猎物庞大的体积和冒险追逐的兴奋劲儿，驱使我获得了这一不同寻常的功绩。现在，兴奋劲儿已经过去，看着这躺在我脚边挣扎、流血的可怜动物，一股同情怜悯之情油然而生。而它那曾经激发了我巨大热情的庞大身躯和重要意义，现在却增加了我的负疚感。似乎我给自己的牺牲品所施加的痛苦，是和它的体积成正比的。好像和毁灭体积较小的动物相比，现在所浪费的生命是其一百倍。","Dismounting, I now fettered my horse to prevent his straying, and advanced to contemplate my victim.I am nothing of a sportsman; I had been prompted to this unwonted exploit by the magnitude of the game, and the excitement of an adventurous chase.Now that the excitement was over, I could not but look with commiseration upon the poor animal that lay struggling and bleeding at my feet.His very size and importance, which had before inspired me with eagerness, now increased my compunction.It seemed as if I had inflicted pain in proportion to the bulk of my victim, and as if it were a hundred-fold greater waste of life than there would have been in the destruction of an animal of inferior size."
"这可怜的动物仍在痛苦地垂死挣扎着，这更增加了我事后良心的不安。显然，它受到了致命的一击，但可能还要好长时间才能死去。不能把它留在这儿，让它活生生地被那些老早就闻到它的血腥味、躲在远处嚎叫着、等着我离去的狼撕成碎片；也不能让那些在空中盘旋着、发出不祥的嘎嘎叫声的乌鸦蚕食它。现在，让它死去，使它脱离痛苦倒成了仁慈之举。因此，我给其中的一把手枪装上弹药，并向这头野牛靠近了些。我发现，这样冷静地给一个受伤的动物补上一枪和热血追逐中的射击是完全不同的。于是，瞄准它前肩后面的位置，我的手枪总算有一次打中了目标。这颗子弹一定是打穿了心脏，因为它剧烈地抽搐了一下，然后便一动不动了。","To add to these after-qualms of conscience, the poor animal lingered in his agony.He had evidently received a mortal wound, but death might be long in coming.It would not do to leave him here to be torn piecemeal, while yet alive, by the wolves that had already snuffed his blood, and were skulking and howling at a distance, and waiting for my departure; and by the ravens that were flapping about, croaking dismally in the air.It became now an act of mercy to give him his quietus, and put him out of his misery.I primed one of the pistols, therefore, and advanced close up to the buffalo.To inflict a wound thus in cold blood, I found a totally different thing from firing in the heat of the chase.Taking aim, however, just behind the fore-shoulder, my pistol for once proved true; the ball must have passed through the heart, for the animal gave one convulsive throe and expired."
"我站在自己鲁莽之下杀死的牺牲品面前默然沉思，暗暗自责，我的马则在旁边吃着草。这时，我的同伴——好动的艺术大师走了过来。他个身手敏捷的人，在“狩猎”这项高雅的艺术中更加有经验，更加无情。他很快便割下了野牛的舌头，交给我作为带回营地的战利品。","While I stood meditating and moralizing over the wreck I had so wantonly produced, with my horse grazing near me, I was rejoined by my fellow-sportsman, the Virtuoso; who, being a man of universal adroitness, and withal, more experienced and hardened in the gentle art of “venerie,” soon managed to carve out the tongue of the buffalo, and delivered it to me to bear back to the camp as a trophy."

"——寻找营地——专员、野马和野牛——狼的小夜曲","—A SEARCH FOR THE CAMP.—THE COMMISSIONER, THE WILD HORSE, AND THE BUFFALO.—A WOLF SERENADE."
"我们现在开始关心起年轻的伯爵来。按他平日急躁的性子，他坚持驱赶着那疲惫不堪的马追牛群，直到同样杀死一头野牛后，他才愿意回来。就这样，他一直到处追着它们，偶尔徒劳地开上一枪，直到他和野牛群都在远处变得模糊起来，最终隆起的山岗、成片的树林和灌木丛将他们彻底淹没了。","Our solicitude was now awakened for the young Count.With his usual eagerness and impetuosity he had persisted in urging his jaded horse in pursuit of the herd, unwilling to return without having likewise killed a buffalo.In this way he had kept on following them, hither and thither, and occasionally firing an ineffectual shot, until by degrees horseman and herd became indistinct in the distance, and at length swelling ground and strips of trees and thickets hid them entirely from sight."
"等到我与我那位爱狩猎的朋友会合时，年轻的伯爵早已不见踪影了。我们就这个问题商量了一番。夜晚将要来临。如果去追他，虽然在昏暗的天色下我们不会完全失去他的踪迹，但追上他以前，天就一定已经黑了。那我们就更难找到回营地的路了——即使是现在，我们要回去也很难。因此，我们决定快马加鞭尽快回到营地，派我们的混血儿及一些习惯于在大草原上游弋的老练猎手去寻找我们的伙伴。","By the time my friend, the amateur, joined me, the young Count had been long lost to view.We held a consultation on the matter.Evening was drawing on.Were we to pursue him, it would be dark before we should overtake him, granting we did not entirely lose trace of him in the gloom.We should then be too much bewildered to find our way back to the encampment; even now, our return would be difficult.We determined, therefore, to hasten to the camp as speedily as possible, and send out our half-breeds, and some of the veteran hunters, skilled in cruising about the prairies, to search for our companion."
"因此，我们开始向着我们认为是营地的方向进发。疲劳的马匹已经跑不动了，只能慢行。渐渐浓重的暮色压向我们，景色也变得越来越模糊了。我们试图辨别出早上注意到的各种路标，但却无济于事。大草原上的景色都如此相似，除了印第安人或是老练的林中人之外，其他任何人都会被迷惑了双眼。最终，夜晚降临了。我们期待可以看到远处营地的火光，听到吃草的马脖子上悬挂的铃铛的声响。有一两次，我们以为找到他们了，但我们错了。除了昆虫单调的鸣叫声，偶尔伴着习习晚风传来的野狼凄凉的嚎叫声，别的我们什么也听不到。我们开始考虑是否要在夜间停止前进，找个灌木丛的背风处露营。我们带着点火的工具，手边也有大量的木柴，野牛的舌头可以让我们充饥。","We accordingly set forward in what we supposed to be the direction of the camp.Our weary horses could hardly be urged beyond a walk.The twilight thickened upon us; the landscape grew gradually indistinct; we tried in vain to recognize various landmarks which we had noted in the morning.The features of the prairies are so similar as to baffle the eye of any but an Indian, or a practised woodman.At length night closed in.We hoped to see the distant glare of campfires; we listened to catch the sound of the bells about the necks of the grazing horses.Once or twice we thought we distinguished them; we were mistaken.Nothing was to be heard but a monotonous concert of insects, with now and then the dismal howl of wolves mingling with the night breeze.We began to think of halting for the night, and bivouacking under the lee of some thicket.We had implements to strike a light; there was plenty of firewood at hand, and the tongues of our buffaloes would furnish us with a repast."
"正准备下马时，我们听到了一声步枪的枪声，很快又听到了召集守夜的号声。我们沿着那个方向一直前进，很快便看到了营地的篝火闪烁在远处一个冲击山谷的茂密树林中。","Just as we were preparing to dismount, we heard the report of a rifle, and shortly after, the notes of the bugle, calling up the night guard.Pushing forward in that direction, the camp fires soon broke on our sight, gleaming at a distance from among the thick groves of an alluvial bottom."
"进入营地后，我们见到了一幅粗野的猎手狂吃痛饮的场景。今天战果累累，所有人都参加了狩猎。大家猎杀了八头野牛，雷鸣般的枪声还在从四周响起。所有人都尽情享受着烤腿肉、烤髓骨和多汁的隆肉等大草原上美食家中威名远扬的美食。我们兴高采烈地下马，加入了他们的欢宴，因为我们从早上开始便一直骑在疲劳的马背上，什么东西也没吃。","As we entered the camp, we found it a scene of rude hunters’ revelry and wassail.There had been a grand day’s sport, in which all had taken a part.Eight buffaloes had been killed; roaring fires were blazing on every side; all hands were feasting upon roasted joints, broiled marrow-bones, and the juicy hump, far-famed among the epicures of the prairies.Right glad were we to dismount and partake of the sturdy cheer, for we had been on our weary horses since morning without tasting food."
"至于那位我们在这个多事之日的一大早便与之分开的、可敬的专员朋友，现在正躺在一个帐篷的角落里。在这场成功的狩猎活动中，他已被折腾得精疲力尽了。","As to our worthy friend, the Commissioner, with whom we had parted company at the outset of this eventful day, we found him lying in a corner of the tent, much the worse for wear, in the course of a successful hunting match."
"我们的贝蒂似乎非常热衷于给专员提供一个超群出从、满足他打猎愿望的机会。他把专员扶上自己的那匹半野的马，驱赶它去追逐一头早已被猎手吓坏的、体型庞大的野牛。这匹马像它的主人一样无所畏惧，还像他一样秉性中有一股凶狠的邪恶之气。另外，它已被训练得对猎物非常熟悉了。因此一旦看到野牛或闻到其气味，它便带着并不情愿的猎手四处狂奔，并且无论去哪儿——上山下坡、趟河越溪、跨沟穿谷——直到它追上猎物才停止。它径直朝着野牛凑了上去，而不是避开它。专员几乎是出于自卫，把双管枪中的两发子弹都射向了敌人。这一猛烈攻击起了作用，不过却不是致命的。野牛愤怒地转向它的追逐者，而这匹被主人训练过的马马上转身避开了。这头野牛跟着又扑了过来。这位可敬的专员，在千钧一发之际，从枪套中拔出了他专用的手枪，向尾追的野牛开了枪。子弹正好射中了野牛的胸部，使得野牛向前轰然倒地。","It seems that our man, Beatte, in his zeal to give the Commissioner an opportunity of distinguishing himself, and gratifying his hunting propensities, had mounted him upon his half-wild horse, and started him in pursuit of a huge buffalo bull, that had already been frightened by the hunters.The horse, which was fearless as his owner, and, like him, had a considerable spice of devil in his composition, and who, besides, had been made familiar with the game, no sooner came in sight and scent of the buffalo, than he set off full speed, bearing the involuntary hunter hither and thither, and whither he would not—up hill and down hill—leaping pools and brooks—dashing through glens and gullies, until he came up with the game.Instead of sheering off, he crowded upon the buffalo.The Commissioner, almost in self-defence, discharged both barrels of a double-barrelled gun into the enemy.The broadside took effect, but was not mortal.The buffalo turned furiously upon his pursuer; the horse, as he had been taught by his owner, wheeled off.The buffalo plunged after him.The worthy Commissioner, in great extremity, drew his sole pistol from his holster, fired it off as a stern-chaser, shot the buffalo full in the breast, and brought him lumbering forward to the earth."
"专员回到营地后，所有人都称赞他的非凡战绩。但他却受到了重创，疲惫不堪。除了他自己，所有人都认为他要捕杀野牛时必然是一个强壮的骑手，一个胜利者。他对所有的赞美和祝贺都置若罔闻，只是对摆在他面前的留给猎手的食物还有一点胃口，然后很快便回到帐篷里摊开四肢躺下了。他宣称什么也不能吸引他再骑上那匹该死的半印第安马了，他这辈子再也不想捕猎野牛了。","The Commissioner returned to camp, lauded on all sides for his signal exploit; but grievously battered and way-worn.He had been a hard rider perforce, and a victor in spite of himself.He turned a deaf ear to all compliments and congratulations; had but little stomach for the hunter’s fare placed before him, and soon retreated to stretch his limbs in the tent, declaring that nothing should tempt him again to mount that half devil Indian horse, and that he had had enough of buffalo hunting for the rest of his life."
"由于现在天色太黑，所以无法派人去寻找年轻的伯爵。但是，人们却不断地放枪、吹号，以便指引他回到营地——或许迷路的他碰巧能听到。但是随着夜晚的到来，他一直没有现身。天空中看不到一颗能为他指路的星星，于是我们判断，无论他在哪儿，他已经放弃在黑夜中穿行并就地露营等待这黎明的到来。","It was too dark now to send any one in search of the young Count.Guns, however, were fired, and the bugles sounded from time to time, to guide him to the camp, if by chance he should straggle within hearing; but the night advanced without his making his appearance.There was not a star visible to guide him, and we concluded that wherever he was, he would give up wandering in the dark, and bivouac until daybreak."
"这是一个阴冷多云的夜晚。营地附近被杀野牛的尸体吸引了大量的狼。这些狼围着它们，非常绝望地哀嚎个不停。忧伤的声音拖成了长长的音符，听起来抑扬顿错，给周围的荒野平添了几分荒凉之气。在大草原上，没有什么比狼半夜的哀嚎更让人感到忧郁的了。这夜晚阴郁而又狂野，周围荒野上充斥着狼那凶残的叫声，更让我们感到郁闷的是，我们年轻且无经验的同伴此时正孤身一人，身处险境。但是，我们相信当黎明再度到来时，他将会找到回营地的路。然后，今晚所发生的所有事情将会仅仅被回忆成满足他冒险口味的佳肴。","It was a raw, overcast night.The carcasses of the buffaloes killed in the vicinity of the camp had drawn about it an unusual number of wolves, who kept up the most forlorn concert of whining yells, prolonged into dismal cadences and inflexions, literally converting the surrounding waste into a howling wilderness.Nothing is more melancholy than the midnight howl of a wolf on a prairie.What rendered the gloom and wildness of the night and the savage concert of the neighboring waste the more dreary to us, was the idea of the lonely and exposed situation of our young and inexperienced comrade.We trusted, however, that on the return of daylight, he would find his way back to the camp, and then all the events of the night would be remembered only as so many savory gratifications of his passion for adventure."
"第三十一章 寻找迷路的伙伴","CHAPTER XXXI. A HUNT FOR A LOST COMRADE,"
"早上来临了，可一两个小时过去之后，还是没有一点儿伯爵的消息。我们因此开始不安起来，没有指南针的帮助，他可能迷路，向着某个相反的方向走去了。因此，落伍者常常会迷失好几天。让我们更加感到焦虑的是：他没有带足干粮，而且对野外生存一窍不通，很容易落到某个潜伏在暗处或是散落在各处的野蛮人群手中。","The morning dawned, and an hour or two passed without any tidings of the Count.We began to feel uneasiness lest, having no compass to aid him, he might perplex himself and wander in some opposite direction.Stragglers are thus often lost for days; what made us the more anxious about him was, that he had no provisions with him, was totally unversed in “woodcraft,” and liable to fall into the hands of some lurking or straggling party of savages."
"因此，一吃完早饭，我们便开始召集志愿者到处去搜寻伯爵。十几个巡逻骑兵骑上一些脚力最佳、精力最充沛的马匹，背上步枪，很快便准备好出发了。混血儿贝蒂、安托万，以及小个子法国混血儿，也热情地加入到这场搜寻行动中。于是我和L.先生带领着搜寻队前往我们进行那场小小的狩猎活动时和伯爵分开的地方。我们一并开始穿越大草原了。骑了几英里之后，我们来到了被我们猎杀的两头野牛的尸首旁。一大批饿极了的狼早就在那儿拼命大啃了。当我们靠近时，它们不情愿地撤退了，躲到几百码的地方怯生生地看着我们，等着我们离去，它们好回来继续享用它们的美餐。","As soon as our people, therefore, had made their breakfast, we beat up for volunteers for a cruise in search of the Count.A dozen of the rangers, mounted on some of the best and freshest horses, and armed with rifles, were soon ready to start; our half-breeds Beatte and Antoine also, with our little mongrel Frenchman, were zealous in the cause; so Mr. L. and myself taking the lead, to show the way to the scene of our little hunt where we had parted company with the Count, we all set out across the prairie.A ride of a couple of miles brought us to the carcasses of the two buffaloes we had killed.A legion of ravenous wolves were already gorging upon them.At our approach they reluctantly drew off, skulking with a caitiff look to the distance of a few hundred yards, and there awaiting our departure, that they might return to their banquet."
"我带贝蒂和安托万来到了年轻的伯爵独自继续追逐野牛的地方。这就像是让猎狗闻闻气味一样。他们立刻就从野牛的足迹中分辨出了他的马的脚印，并迅速地出发，眼睛盯着路面，沿着一条几乎笔直的路线，一直向上走了一英里。这时，来到了兽群分散开、到处跑的一片草地上。在这儿，马蹄印变得曲折迂回、重复并且常常相互交叉。我们的混血儿们就像是失去嗅迹的猎狗一样。当我们停下来等着他们解开谜团时，贝蒂突然发出了一声印第安人惯有的高喊声，或者说是尖声急叫了一声，并指向远处的一座小山。专心地看了一会儿之后，我们发现山顶上有一个骑手。“那是伯爵！”贝蒂高喊道，并飞奔了出去，整个队伍也跟在他后面。一会儿之后，他勒住了马。另一个身影骑着马出现在了山脊上。这完全改变了事态。伯爵是独自走失的，营地里没有其他的人失踪。如果这两个骑手中的其中一个果真是伯爵，那另一个一定是个印第安人。如果是个印第安人，那极有可能是个波尼人。也许他们两个都是印第安人，是某个隐藏在附近的部落的侦察兵。当我们就此进行仓促的讨论时，那两个骑手从山的侧面溜了下去，不见了踪影。其中一个巡逻骑兵认为，也许山丘的后面有一队落伍的波尼人，伯爵很可能已经落入他们手中了。这种看法在这个小小的队伍里引起一片震惊。在混血儿们的带领下，所有的马立刻飞奔起来。那些年轻的巡逻骑兵们一想到要和印第安人展开一场小规模的战斗，便都兴奋地在马上狂喊不止。这场要么危险，要么一无所获的疾驰把我们带到了山丘的边缘，并揭开了我们的误解。在一个峡谷中，我们发现那两个骑手正站在他们所猎杀的一头野牛旁边。原来他们是两个巡逻骑兵，在无人察觉的情况下，比我们早一点儿离开了营地。他们沿着直线一路来到这里，而我们则在大草原上绕了一个大圈。","I conducted Beatte and Antoine to the spot whence the young Count had continued the chase alone.It was like putting hounds upon the scent.They immediately distinguished the track of his horse amidst the trampings of the buffaloes, and set off at a round pace, following with the eye in nearly a straight course, for upward of a mile, when they came to where the herd had divided, and run hither and thither about a meadow.Here the track of the horse’s hoofs wandered and doubled and often crossed each other; our half-breeds were like hounds at fault.While we were at a halt, waiting until they should unravel the maze, Beatte suddenly gave a short Indian whoop, or rather yelp, and pointed to a distant hill.On regarding it attentively, we perceived a horseman on the summit.“It is the Count!” cried Beatte, and set off at full gallop, followed by the whole company.In a few moments he checked his horse.Another figure on horseback had appeared on the brow of the hill.This completely altered the case.The Count had wandered off alone; no other person had been missing from the camp.If one of these horsemen were indeed the Count, the other must be an Indian.If an Indian, in all probability a Pawnee.Perhaps they were both Indians; scouts of some party lurking in the vicinity.While these and other suggestions were hastily discussed, the two horsemen glided down from the profile of the hill, and we lost sight of them.One of the rangers suggested that there might be a straggling party of Pawnees behind the hill, and that the Count might have fallen into their hands.The idea had an electric effect upon the little troop.In an instant every horse was at full speed, the half-breeds leading the way; the young rangers as they rode set up wild yelps of exultation at the thoughts of having a brush with the Indians.A neck or nothing gallop brought us to the skirts of the hill, and revealed our mistake.In a ravine we found the two horsemen standing by the carcass of a buffalo which they had killed.They proved to be two rangers, who, unperceived, had left the camp a little before us, and had come here in a direct line, while we had made a wide circuit about the prairie."
"这个小插曲到此结束了，突如其来的兴奋也告一段落。我们又再次慢慢地、冷静地折回那片草地，但过了好长一段时间，混血儿们才重新找到了伯爵的踪迹。在最终找到伯爵的踪迹之后，他们继续跟着野牛和马交错重叠的脚印前进，直到来到马蹄印不再和野牛的脚印混杂，而开始单独在大草原上蜿蜒伸展的地方，但这脚印却一直朝着和营地相反的方向。伯爵显然是在这儿放弃了追逐牛群，转而努力寻找回营地的路。但由于夜幕降临，他迷失了方向，也完全辨不清指南针上的方向了。","This episode being at an end, and the sudden excitement being over, we slowly and coolly retraced our steps to the meadow; but it was some time before our half-breeds could again get on the track of the Count.Having at length found it, they succeeded in following it through all its doublings, until they came to where it was no longer mingled with the tramp of buffaloes, but became single and separate, wandering here and there about the prairies, but always tending in a direction opposite to that of the camp.Here the Count had evidently given up the pursuit of the herd, and had endeavored to find his way to the encampment, but had become bewildered as the evening shades thickened around him, and had completely mistaken the points of the compass."
"在这整场搜寻过程中，混血儿们在追踪足迹上显示了敏锐的眼力，而印第安人也因此而闻名于世。尤其是贝蒂，他像一只老练的猎狗那样锲而不舍。有时，他会策马轻快地小跑一阵，眼睛紧盯着他坐骑前方的地面，并清晰地辨别出草皮上的踏痕。而这痕迹对我来说除非是凑近细看，否则便什么也看不到。有时，他会缓辔徐行，聚精会神地盯着对我来说一无所有的地面。然后，他会下马，抓着马笼头一步步小心翼翼地前进，头低着查看四周的地面，寻找着指示他前进的蛛丝马迹。在有些地方，土壤很硬并且草皮凋零，他会完全找不到足迹。这时，他会前后左右地反复徘徊，寻找线索；有时会回到他失去线索的地方，换一个方向重新前进。如果这也不行，那他就会去检查附近河流的河岸，或是峡谷底部的沙地，希望可以找到伯爵路过的痕迹。当他再次找到足迹后，他便会重新上马，继续前行。最终，穿过一条被侵蚀的河岸上留着深深的马蹄印的小溪之后，我们来到了一片干燥的高草原。在这儿，我们的混血儿们被彻底难倒了。尽管他们搜索了每一个方向，但却看不到任何一个脚印。最终，贝蒂停了下来，沮丧地直摇头。","In all this quest our half-breeds displayed that quickness of eye, in following up a track, for which Indians are so noted.Beatte, especially, was as staunch as a veteran hound.Sometimes he would keep forward on an easy trot; his eyes fixed on the ground a little ahead of his horse, clearly distinguishing prints in the herbage which to me were invisible, excepting on the closest inspection.Sometimes he would pull up and walk his horse slowly, regarding the ground intensely, where to my eye nothing was apparent.Then he would dismount, lead his horse by the bridle, and advance cautiously step by step, with his face bent towards the earth, just catching, here and there, a casual indication of the vaguest kind to guide him onward.In some places where the soil was hard and the grass withered, he would lose the track entirely, and wander backward and forward, and right and left, in search of it; returning occasionally to the place where he had lost sight of it, to take a new departure.If this failed he would examine the banks of the neighboring streams, or the sandy bottoms of the ravines, in hopes of finding tracks where the Count had crossed.When he again came upon the track, he would remount his horse, and resume his onward course.At length, after crossing a stream, in the crumbling banks of which the hoofs of the horse were deeply dented, we came upon a high dry prairie, where our half-breeds were completely baffled.Not a foot-print was to be discerned, though they searched in every direction; and Beatte, at length coming to a pause, shook his head despondingly."
"这时，一小群鹿从附近的一个山谷中跑了出来，跳跃着从我们面前经过。贝蒂从他的马背上挺身而起，举起步枪射击，并轻微地打伤了其中的一头，但却没有把它打倒。枪声还没有落下，我们便听到远处传来一声长长的呼喊。我们环顾四周，却什么也没看到。接着，我们又听到一声长长的呼喊，最终看到从森林的边缘冒出一个骑手。一眼看去我们便知道了那是年轻的伯爵，大家都不约而同地高呼雀跃起来，并飞奔过去迎接他。这对双方来说都是一次愉快的会面，因为我们一直因他年轻又没有经验而焦虑不安；而对他来说，满足了冒险欲望的他，能再一次回到朋友当中是非常值得欣喜的。","Just then a small herd of deer, roused from a neighboring ravine, came bounding by us.Beatte sprang from his horse, levelled his rifle, and wounded one slightly, but without bringing it to the ground.The report of the rifle was almost immediately followed by a long halloo from a distance.We looked around, but could see nothing.Another long halloo was heard, and at length a horseman was descried, emerging out of a skirt of forest.A single glance showed him to be the young Count; there was a universal shout and scamper, every one setting off full gallop to greet him.It was a joyful meeting to both parties; for, much anxiety had been felt by us all on account of his youth and inexperience, and for his part, with all his love of adventure, he seemed right glad to be once more among his friends."
"就像我们所猜测的那样，在前一天晚上，他完全搞错了方向，而且一直游荡到天黑才想到了露宿。晚上很冷，但他却不敢生火，以防那些潜伏中的印第安人部落因此而发现他。他用小毛巾把马腿缚住，留它在草原的空阔处吃草。而他自己则爬到一棵树上，把马鞍固定在一个树杈上，让自己安全地背靠树干坐下，准备度过一个偶尔被狼的嚎叫声所打断的沉闷且不安的夜晚。他非常高兴自己失望了。白天的劳累让他很快便熟睡过去；他高兴地梦到了他那在瑞士的家，直到天光大亮时，他才醒来。","As we supposed, he had completely mistaken his course on the preceding evening, and had wandered about until dark, when he thought of bivouacking.The night was cold, yet he feared to make a fire, lest it might betray him to some lurking party of Indians.Hobbling his horse with his pocket handkerchief, and leaving him to graze on the margin of the prairie, he clambered into a tree, fixed his saddle in the fork of the branches, and placing himself securely with his back against the trunk, prepared to pass a dreary and anxious night, regaled occasionally with the howlings of the wolves.He was agreeably disappointed.The fatigue of the day soon brought on a sound sleep; he had delightful dreams about his home in Switzerland, nor did he wake until it was broad daylight."
"然后，他从歇息的树上爬了下来，骑上马，来到了一个山丘光秃秃的顶部。从那里，他看到自己周围是一片杳无人迹的荒原，但不远处逶迤的加拿大人大河穿越在林地边界之间。见到这条河给了他安慰，他想，如果自己找不到回营地的路，或者自己的同伴找不到他，那他可以沿着这条河走，这河一定可以把他带到某个边防站或是印第安人村落的。所以我们这次偶然的捕猎野牛事件就这样结束了。","He then descended from his roosting-place, mounted his horse, and rode to the naked summit of a hill, whence he beheld a trackless wilderness around him, but, at no great distance, the Grand Canadian winding its way between borders of forest land.The sight of this river consoled him with the idea that, should he fail in finding his way back to the camp, or in being found by some party of his comrades, he might follow the course of the stream, which could not fail to conduct him to some frontier post, or Indian hamlet.So closed the events of our hap-hazard buffalo hunt."
"第三十二章 草原犬鼠的王国","CHAPTER XXXII. REPUBLIC OF PRAIRIE DOGS."
"当我们从寻找年轻伯爵的征途归来时，我得知猎手们在距离营地大约一英里的山丘的平顶上发现了一洞或是被称为一村的草原犬鼠。之前我听说过一些关于这些小动物的习性和特征，于是我决定去看看这个团体。实际上，草原犬鼠是远西区地区的珍奇动物之一。旅行者们喜欢讲述关于它们的精彩故事，并不时赋予它们一种理性生物所拥有的精明特征及社交习性，还说它们拥有自己的民主政府和内部系统，几乎类似于人们通常给予海狸的评价那样。","On returning from our expedition in quest of the young Count, I learned that a burrow, or village, as it is termed, of prairie dogs had been discovered on the level summit of a hill, about a mile from the camp.Having heard much of the habits and peculiarities of these little animals, I determined to pay a visit to the community.The prairie dog is, in fact, one of the curiosities of the Far West, about which travellers delight to tell marvellous tales, endowing him at times with something of the politic and social habits of a rational being, and giving him systems of civil government and domestic economy, almost equal to what they used to bestow upon the beaver."
"草原犬鼠是一种鼠兔类动物，体积和兔子差不多大。它们生性活泼好动，反应机智，行动迅速，敏感且有点儿任性。草原犬鼠是群居动物，非常喜欢与别的犬鼠一起住在一个大的群体中，有时会绵延好几英亩的地方。在那儿，无数的小土堆标识着这些居民地下洞穴的入口。那些被踩踏出来的、像街道和小巷一样的小径，则显示出它们的好动和不安分。根据别人对它们的描述，它们总是在不停地运动、做事，以及处理公共事务。它们东奔西跑，似乎是在相互串门互道家长里短，或是在凉爽的夜晚聚集在一起开会，又或是一场阵雨之后，在旷野中互相打闹嬉戏。有时，尤其是在月光明亮的时候，它们会狂欢到半夜，像小狗那样用一种短促微弱的声调叫喊着。然而，就算是它们正处在嬉闹狂欢的高潮，只要有一点儿的警报，它们也会立马消失在自己的洞穴中，整个村落变得空荡荡的，一片死寂。如果被追捕者死死按住，没有任何逃脱的希望，它们便会显示出一副好斗的姿态，露出想要愤怒反抗而又无能为力的古怪神情。","The prairie dog is an animal of the coney kind, and about the size of a rabbit.He is of a sprightly mercurial nature; quick, sensitive, and somewhat petulant.He is very gregarious, living in large communities, sometimes of several acres in extent, where innumerable little heaps of earth show the entrances to the subterranean cells of the inhabitants, and the well beaten tracks, like lanes and streets, show their mobility and restlessness.According to the accounts given of them, they would seem to be continually full of sport, business, and public affairs; whisking about hither and thither, as if on gossiping visits to each other’s houses, or congregating in the cool of the evening, or after a shower, and gambolling together in the open air.Sometimes, especially when the moon shines, they pass half the night in revelry, barking or yelping with short, quick, yet weak tones, like those of very young puppies.While in the height of their playfulness and clamor, however, should there be the least alarm, they all vanish into their cells in an instant, and the village remains blank and silent.In case they are hard pressed by their pursuers, without any hope of escape, they will assume a pugnacious air, and a most whimsical look of impotent wrath and defiance."
"草原犬鼠无法在自己的家中过一种独立而又不被打扰的生活。听说猫头鹰和响尾蛇会和它们同住，不过它们是作为受邀的贵客还是不受欢迎的侵入者，则是一个有争议的问题。这些猫头鹰是一个奇特的种类，似乎具有鹰的特征。但它们要比普通的猫头鹰个头更高，站得更直，看上去更加警觉，也飞得更高。它们不仅会在夜间远足，在大白天也会出发远行。","The prairie dogs are not permitted to remain sole and undisturbed inhabitants of their own homes.Owls and rattlesnakes are said to take up their abodes with them; but whether as invited guests or unwelcome intruders, is a matter of controversy.The owls are of a peculiar kind, and would seem to partake of the character of the hawk; for they are taller and more erect on their legs, more alert in their looks and rapid in their flight than ordinary owls, and do not confine their excursions to the night, but sally forth in broad day."
"有些人说猫头鹰只住在草原犬鼠因某个亲属死去而丢弃的、将要毁坏的洞穴中，因为他们认为这种小动物非常敏感，它们不愿继续住在亲眼看到一个亲友死去的地方。其他一些有想象力的推测者则认为猫头鹰有些像是草原犬鼠的管家；还有一种类似的说法是，在某种程度上，它们是指导老师，教小犬鼠们如何叫喊。","Some say that they only inhabit cells which the prairie dogs have deserted, and suffered to go to ruin, in consequence of the death in them of some relative; for they would make out this little animal to be endowed with keen sensibilities, that will not permit it to remain in the dwelling where it has witnessed the death of a friend.Other fanciful speculators represent the owl as a kind of housekeeper to the prairie dog; and, from having a note very similar, insinuate that it acts, in a manner, as family preceptor, and teaches the young litter to bark."
"至于响尾蛇，尽管人们认为它比马屁精或骗子好不了多少，并以此取巧获得了这些诚实、轻信的小犬鼠的关心，让它们怀着万分沉重的心情接待了它，但在这个非常有趣的家庭里它到底扮演什么角色，到目前为止还没有得到任何令人满意的结论。确定的是，如果它扮演的是马屁精的角色，那它有时会用超出正常应得报酬的东西来安慰自己，因为在它的胃里，不时会发现这个家庭的年幼成员。","As to the rattlesnake, nothing satisfactory has been ascertained of the part he plays in this most interesting household; though he is considered as little better than a sycophant and sharper, that winds himself into the concerns of the honest, credulous little dog, and takes him in most sadly.Certain it is, if he acts as toad-eater, he occasionally solaces himself with more than the usual perquisites of his order; as he is now and then detected with one of the younger members of the family in his maw."
"这些就是我所能够搜集到的关于这种大草原上的小居民的一些内部系统特征。它们和它们的小人国似乎在远西区地区的猎手们中间引起了一些离奇古怪的猜测和滑稽可笑的评论。","Such are a few of the particulars that I could gather about the domestic economy of this little inhabitant of the prairies, who, with his pigmy republic, appears to be a subject of much whimsical speculation and burlesque remarks among the hunters of the Far West."
"接近傍晚时，我和一个伙伴才出发去拜访这个新奇的穴群。不幸的是，在白天的行程中有些巡逻骑兵已经侵袭了这个穴群。他们射杀了两三个居民，使整个敏感的集体陷入一片混乱。当我们靠近时，可以看到许许多多的居民坐在各自的洞口处，而哨兵则似乎是站在外面保持警戒。一看到我们，哨兵们马上跑进洞里去发警报；于是，所有居民都发出一声短促的叫喊，并潜入洞中，脚后跟在空中轻快地舞动着，好像是在翻筋斗。","It was toward evening that I set out with a companion, to visit the village in question.Unluckily, it had been invaded in the course of the day by some of the rangers, who had shot two or three of its inhabitants, and thrown the whole sensitive community in confusion.As we approached, we could perceive numbers of the inhabitants seated at the entrances of their cells, while sentinels seemed to have been posted on the outskirts, to keep a look-out.At sight of us, the picket guards scampered in and gave the alarm; whereupon every inhabitant gave a short yelp, or bark, and dived into his hole, his heels twinkling in the air as if he had thrown a somersault."
"我们穿过了这覆盖了大约三十英亩土地的整个穴群或王国，但却连一个居民的痕迹也看不到。我们尽力把步枪的通条伸进洞穴来探测它们，但却触不到任何犬鼠、猫头鹰或是响尾蛇。悄悄地移动了一小段距离之后，我们一动不动地趴在地上，静静地观察了好久。不久之后，一个小心谨慎的老年犬鼠慢慢地探出了鼻子，但立刻又缩回去了。更远处，另一只犬鼠完全探出了身子。但一瞥到我们，它便翻了个筋斗，重新跳进洞中。最终，一些住在穴群另一端的犬鼠见到一直没有什么动静，便鼓起勇气偷偷溜了出来，匆忙跑到远处的一个洞穴里，那里可能是与它家亲戚或是平日闲聊的朋友的住处。它们为亲戚朋友的安全担心，也希望可以与之就刚刚发生的事件交换意见。","We traversed the whole village, or republic, which covered an area of about thirty acres; but not a whisker of an inhabitant was to be seen.We probed their cells as far as the ram-rods of our rifles would reach, but could unearth neither dog, nor owl, nor rattlesnake.Moving quietly to a little distance, we lay down upon the ground, and watched for a long time, silent and motionless.By and by, a cautious old burgher would slowly put forth the end of his nose, but instantly draw it in again.Another, at a greater distance, would emerge entirely; but, catching a glance of us, would throw a somersault, and plunge back again into his hole.At length, some who resided on the opposite side of the village, taking courage from the continued stillness, would steal forth, and hurry off to a distant hole, the residence possibly of some family connection, or gossiping friend, about whose safety they were solicitous, or with whom they wished to compare notes about the late occurrences."
"还有一些更加大胆的犬鼠三五成群地聚集在街道和公共场所，似乎是要讨论刚刚发生在全体国民身上的暴行，以及对它们同伴的残忍谋杀。","Others, still more bold, assembled in little knots, in the streets and public places, as if to discuss the recent outrages offered to the commonwealth, and the atrocious murders of their fellow-burghers."
"我们从地上站起来向前走去，想要更清楚地观察它们的公共活动。这时，犬鼠群中响起一声接一声的尖叫，会议立刻解散，犬鼠的脚在空中朝各个方向飞快地舞动，刹那间它们全部消失在地下了。","We rose from the ground and moved forward, to take a nearer view of these public proceedings, when yelp! yelp! yelp!—there was a shrill alarm passed from mouth to mouth; the meetings suddenly dispersed; feet twinkled in the air in every direction; and in an instant all had vanished into the earth."
"黄昏迫使我们结束了观察，但我所听到的关于这些精明小动物的道德品质，却在我的脑海中产生了一连串的奇特比较。回到营地后，这种比较还在进行。深夜，当所有人都入睡后，我依旧醒着，躺在那儿好静静听着外面的声响，依稀可以听到远处穴群传来的喧闹尖锐的叫声。我情不自禁地想象着这些居民闹哄哄地聚在一起，夸夸其谈地争辩着，制定着公共安全计划，并为王国的权利和尊严遭到侵犯和损坏而进行辩护。","The dusk of the evening put an end to our observations, but the train of whimsical comparisons produced in my brain by the moral attributes which I had heard given to these little politic animals, still continued after my return to camp; and late in the night, as I lay awake after all the camp was asleep, and heard in the stillness of the hour, a faint clamor of shrill voices from the distant village, I could not help picturing to myself the inhabitants gathered together in noisy assemblage and windy debate, to devise plans for the public safety, and to vindicate the invaded rights and insulted dignity of the republic."
"第三十三章 营地里的会议　","CHAPTER XXXIII. A COUNCIL IN THE CAMP."
"——归家的理由——丢失马——分队离开回家——沼泽——野马——营地的夜景——猫头鹰，黎明的先兆","—REASONS FOR FACING HOMEWARD.—HORSES LOST.—DEPARTURE WITH A DETACHMENT ON THE HOMEWARD ROUTE.—SWAMP.—WILD HORSE.—CAMP SCENES BY NIGHT.—THE OWL, HARBINGER OF DAWN."
"准备早饭期间，我们举行了一场关于接下来的动向的会议。在过去的一两天里，巡逻骑兵中已经流露出了不满的征兆。他们大多不习惯大草原上的生活，对它的贫瘠及军营的种种限制感到不安。面包严重短缺，并且他们对不断的旅行也感到疲倦了。实际上，远足的新鲜感和兴奋劲儿已经荡然无存了。他们已经捕猎过鹿、熊、麋鹿、野牛和野马，也再已没有能引起他们兴趣的猎物了。因此，人们普遍开始想调头回家。","While breakfast was preparing, a council was held as to our future movements.Symptoms of discontent had appeared for a day or two past among the rangers, most of whom, unaccustomed to the life of the prairies, had become impatient of its privations, as well as the restraints of the camp.The want of bread had been felt severely, and they were wearied with constant travel.In fact, the novelty and excitement of the expedition were at an end.They had hunted the deer, the bear, the elk, the buffalo, and the wild horse, and had no further object of leading interest to look forward to.A general inclination prevailed, therefore, to turn homeward."
"还有一些重要的原因使得队长和指挥官们采纳了这个建议。我们的马匹大多都因长时间旅行和狩猎而累坏了。由于缺乏优质牧草，并且晚上为防止它们被印第安人劫掠，我们还总是把它们拴起来，所以它们也日渐消瘦了。上一场雨也似乎把稀疏的草皮上所残留的那一点点儿营养给冲刷掉了。自从在暴风雨中扎营后，我们的马匹就很快没有精神头儿，没有力气了。受到精心照料的马匹，早已经习惯了饲料，以及马厩和农场里有规律且充足的营养供给。所以它们已丧失在大草原上旅行的勇气和精神了。在我们所进行的所有这种远足中，我们最偏爱的是强壮耐劳的印第安马。它们一般是一种北美野马或其的杂交品种。它们可以承受所有艰辛劳顿，也不怕牧草匮乏，依靠大草原上的野草即可茁壮成长。","Grave reasons disposed the Captain and his officers to adopt this resolution.Our horses were generally much jaded by the fatigues of travelling and hunting, and had fallen away sadly for want of good pasturage, and from being tethered at night, to protect them from Indian depredations.The late rains, too, seemed to have washed away the nourishment from the scanty herbage that remained; and since our encampment during the storm, our horses had lost flesh and strength rapidly.With every possible care, horses, accustomed to grain, and to the regular and plentiful nourishment of the stable and the farm, lose heart and condition in travelling on the prairies.In all expeditions of the kind we were engaged in, the hardy Indian horses, which are generally mustangs, or a cross of the wild breed, are to be preferred.They can stand all fatigues, hardships, and privations, and thrive on the grasses and the wild herbage of the plains."
"而我们人呢，在行动中表现也得缺乏深谋远虑。在旅途中，无论我们何时碰到猎物，都会抓住一切机会飞奔着去追赶猎物。他们没有注意保持马的体力和精力，马匹都耗尽了力气，疲惫不堪。在这样的旅程中，要尽最大可能地让马可以安静地行走，每天平均的行程不应超过十英里。","Our men, too, had acted with little forethought; galloping off whenever they had a chance, after the game that we encountered while on the march.In this way they had strained and wearied their horses, instead of husbanding their strength and spirits.On a tour of the kind, horses should as seldom as possible be put off of a quiet walk; and the average day’s journey should not exceed ten miles."
"我们希望可以尽快前进到达雷德河边上的低洼地，那儿有大量的幼藤——每年的这个季节对牲畜最有营养的草料。现在，我们还需要几天时间才能回去，但在这期间，许多马匹可能会精疲力竭。这也正是印第安人狩猎部族放火烧大草原的时候。这片土地上所有的牧草都已经干枯了，很容易点燃。我们和要塞之间的大草原很可能被某个返程的奥塞奇部族点燃，这种危险与日俱增，我们可能就只能在一片焦土上穿行了。总之，我们在这个季节出发得太晚，或是在旅程的开始阶段闲荡得太多了，所以就没法按照原定的计划结束旅程了。况且，如果我们继续前进，就会面临另一个危险：我们将损失大部分的马匹，除了要遭受其他各种不便外，还不得不步行回去。于是，我们决定放弃继续前行，转而向东南方向前进，以便尽快回到吉布森要塞。","We had hoped, by pushing forward, to reach the bottoms of the Red River, which abound with young cane, a most nourishing forage for cattle at this season of the year.It would now take us several days to arrive there, and in the meantime many of our horses would probably give out.It was the time, too, when the hunting parties of Indians set fire to the prairies; the herbage, throughout this part of the country, was in that parched state, favorable to combustion, and there was daily more and more risk that the prairies between us and the fort would be set on fire by some of the return parties of Osages, and a scorched desert left for us to traverse.In a word, we had started too late in the season, or loitered too much in the early part of our march, to accomplish our originally intended tour; and there was imminent hazard, if we continued on, that we should lose the greater part of our horses; and, besides suffering various other inconveniences, be obliged to return on foot.It was determined, therefore, to give up all further progress, and, turning our faces to the southeast, to make the best of our way back to Fort Gibson."
"决议一经采纳，大家立刻就迫不及待地行动起来。但是，有几匹马失踪了，其中包括队长和外科医生的马。有人去寻找它们了，可直到早上还是没有任何消息。同时，我们的队伍已经整装待发了。专员决定带着他原先那由一个中尉和十四个巡逻骑兵组成的护卫队先走，留下队长和大部队在方便的时候出发。于是，十点钟时，我们在贝蒂的指引下启程了。他曾在这片土地上打过猎，知道返回要塞的直行路线。","This resolution being taken, there was an immediate eagerness to put it into operation.Several horses, however, were missing, and among others those of the Captain and the Surgeon.Persons had gone in search of them, but the morning advanced without any tidings of them.Our party, in the meantime, being all ready for a march, the Commissioner determined to set off in the advance, with his original escort of a lieutenant and fourteen rangers, leaving the Captain to come on at his convenience, with the main body.At ten o’clock we accordingly started, under the guidance of Beatte, who had hunted over this part of the country, and knew the direct route to the garrison."
"我们沿着大草原的边缘，朝东南方向前进了一段距离。一路上，我们看到了各种各样的野生动物：鹿、白狼、黑狼，还有野牛和野马。对于野马，我们的混血儿们和托尼什都徒劳地追赶过，但也只能让他们本来就劳累不堪的坐骑更加疲惫罢了。实际上，在这种艰难的追逐中，被捕获的野马也仅仅是马群中体质较弱、最没有脚力的马匹。而猎人的马则常常会因此跑得精疲力尽。实际上，猎人是在冒着牺牲一匹好马的危险去捕捉一匹劣马。在这种情况下，马背上的托尼什是一个十足的小魔鬼。他以累垮自己骑过的所有坐骑而出名。他成功地将我在旅程之初让他骑的那匹强壮的灰色马累得跛了脚，几乎残废。","For some distance we skirted the prairie, keeping a southeast direction; and in the course of our ride we saw a variety of wild animals, deer, white and black wolves, buffaloes, and wild horses.To the latter, our half-breeds and Tonish gave ineffectual chase, only serving to add to the weariness of their already jaded steeds.Indeed it is rarely that any but the weaker and least fleet of the wild horses are taken in these hard racings; while the horse of the huntsman is prone to be knocked up.The latter, in fact, risks a good horse to catch a bad one.On this occasion, Tonish, who was a perfect imp on horseback, and noted for ruining every animal he bestrode, succeeded in laming and almost disabling the powerful gray on which we had mounted him at the outset of our tour."
"前进了几英里之后，我们离开了大草原，并折向东行，走上了贝蒂所说的一条奥塞奇人之前的战道。这条路引导我们穿过了一条崎岖的乡间小道，这儿满是低矮的树林和藤蔓缠绞的灌木丛，有的地方还被各种很深的沟壑、溪流所隔断。溪流中欢快地奔流着利特尔河源头的水。走了大约十四英里之后，三点钟左右时，我们在一个小山谷的几片水塘边扎了营。我们从上一个营地带来了一些食物，于是便津津有味地吃起了炖牛肉、烤鹿肉、带馅煎饼、熊油炸的带馅面团，以及一种黄花泡成的茶——我们发现整个旅程中它成了像咖啡一样受欢迎的饮料。实际上，根据西方人的习俗，自从咖啡出现以来，它就成了每餐必备、没必要夸耀的饮品了。先将咖啡豆放在一个煎锅里随便烘烤一下，然后倒入一个皮袋，用一块圆石碾碎，之后放在我们主要的、也几乎是唯一的厨具野营水壶里，加上河水或溪水煮。在大草原上这些水因为泥土的关系颜色比较深，因此使水里有很多颗粒物悬浮在其中。实际上，在旅行过程中，我们尝过了每一种土壤的味道。我们汲取的水的味道不同，颜色也是五花八门，可以和药剂师店铺里的各种药水的颜色相媲美。至少在每年的这个季节，纯净清澈的水在大草原上是罕见的奢侈品。晚饭结束后，我们派出哨兵在我们简陋狭小的营地周围巡逻，并把兽皮和毯子铺在现在几乎没有任何树叶的树底下，然后酣然入睡，直到天亮。","After proceeding a few miles, we left the prairie, and struck to the east, taking what Beatte pronounced an old Osage war track.This led us through a rugged tract of country, overgrown with scrubbed forests and entangled thickets, and intersected by deep ravines, and brisk-running streams, the sources of Little River.About three o’clock, we encamped by some pools of water in a small valley, having come about fourteen miles.We had brought on a supply of provisions from our last camp, and supped heartily upon stewed buffalo meat, roasted venison, beignets, or fritters of flour fried in bear’s lard, and tea, made of a species of the golden-rod, which we had found, throughout our whole route, almost as grateful a beverage as coffee.Indeed our coffee, which, as long as it held out, had been served up with every meal, according to the custom of the West, was by no means a beverage to boast of.It was roasted in a frying-pan. without much care, pounded in a leathern bag, with a round stone, and boiled in our prime and almost only kitchen utensil, the camp kettle, in “branch” or brook water; which, on the prairies, is deeply colored by the soil, of which it always holds abundant particles in a state of solution and suspension.In fact, in the course of our tour, we had tasted the quality of every variety of soil, and the draughts of water we had taken might vie in diversity of color, if not of flavor, with the tinctures of an apothecary’s shop.Pure, limpid water is a rare luxury on the prairies, at least at this season of the year.Supper over, we placed sentinels about our scanty and diminished camp, spread our skins and blankets under the trees, now nearly destitute of foliage, and slept soundly until morning."
"黎明时天气非常好。营地里再次充满欢声笑语，一想到很快便可以抵达要塞，开怀大嚼面包和蔬菜，每个人都高兴不已。甚至是我们那位沉默稳重的贝蒂，也受到了这种场景的鼓舞。当他策马上路时，我听到他用鼻子哼唱着一首几乎已经失传的印第安人小调。然而，所有这些短暂的快乐很快便随着旅程的劳累而渐渐消失了，因为我们又开始穿越和昨天一样崎岖、多山且布满灌木的乡间了。在上午的行程中，我们到达了利特尔河河谷，这是一片宽阔的冲击河谷。当下，河水已经溢出了河岸，并淹没了河谷的一大片区域。棘手的问题是，我们要把河流本身和它所淹没的宽阔水域区分开来，并找到可以涉水而过的地方；但河水到处都很深，十分泥泞，被侵蚀的河岸也很陡峭。因此，我们在贝蒂的带领下，在这条弯曲的小河流的几个转弯处徘徊了好久，感觉自己陷入了一个由沼泽、灌木丛和死水塘组成的、没路可走的迷宫。有时候，我们疲倦的马匹得费九牛二虎之力拖着四肢往前走很长一段距离，水花不时溅到马镫上，马蹄则不时磕磕绊绊地陷入草根和倒伏的植物中。有时候，我们不得不艰难地穿越长着刺藤和葡萄藤的密集灌木丛。这些藤蔓植物几乎快把我们从马鞍上拽下去。在一个地方，一匹驮马陷入了泥潭，倒向了一边，我们只得费力地解救它。无论走到哪儿，只要是泥土裸露在外或是有沙洲的地方，我们便会看到无数的熊、狼、野马、火鸡和水禽的足迹。这说明这个河谷可以给猎人提供丰富的猎物。然而，由于大家都已经厌倦了打猎，又加上过于疲劳，所以大家不再对这些足迹感到兴奋了。但在旅行刚开始时，这可是会引发他们狂热的期盼的。现在，他们唯一的愿望便是坚持走到要塞。","We had a beautiful daybreak.The camp again resounded with cheerful voices; every one was animated with the thoughts of soon being at the fort, and revelling on bread and vegetables.Even our saturnine man, Beatte, seemed inspired on this occasion; and as he drove up the horses for the march, I heard him singing, in nasal tones, a most forlorn Indian ditty.All this transient gayety, however, soon died away amidst the fatigues of our march, which lay through the same kind of rough, hilly, thicketed country as that of yesterday.In the course of the morning we arrived at the valley of the Little River, where it wound through a broad bottom of alluvial soil.At present it had overflowed its banks, and inundated a great part of the valley.The difficulty was to distinguish the stream from the broad sheets of water it had formed, and to find a place where it might be forded; for it was in general deep and miry, with abrupt crumbling banks.Under the pilotage of Beatte, therefore, we wandered for some time among the links made by this winding stream, in what appeared to us a trackless labyrinth of swamps, thickets, and standing pools.Sometimes our jaded horses dragged their limbs forward with the utmost difficulty, having to toil for a great distance, with the water up to the stirrups, and beset at the bottom with roots and creeping plants.Sometimes we had to force our way through dense thickets of brambles and grapevines, which almost pulled us out of our saddles.In one place, one of the pack-horses sunk in the mire and fell on his side, so as to be extricated with great difficulty.Wherever the soil was bare, or there was a sand-bank, we beheld innumerable tracks of bears, wolves, wild horses, turkeys, and water-fowl; showing the abundant sport this valley might afford to the huntsman.Our men, however, were sated with hunting, and too weary to be excited by these signs, which in the outset of our tour would have put them in a fever of anticipation.Their only desire, at present, was to push on doggedly for the fortress."
"最终，我们成功找到了一个可以涉水过河的地方，从那儿渡过了利特尔河，渡河时水和泥都漫到了马肚带上。然后我们停留了一个半小时，以检查一下湿漉漉的包裹，也让马匹休息一下。","At length we succeeded in finding a fording place, where we all crossed Little River, with the water and mire to the saddle-girths, and then halted for an hour and a half, to overhaul the wet baggage, and give the horses time to rest."
"我们重新踏上征程，来到了一块宜人的小草地，周围环绕着一片榆树和三叶杨树组成的小树林，而在草地中央，一匹漂亮的黑马正在吃草。走在前面的贝蒂示意我们停下，而骑着一匹母马的他一步步地慢慢靠上前去，同时逼真地模仿着马嘶鸣的声音。这匹大草原上高贵的骏马凝视了一会儿，鼻子深吸着空气，一边竖起耳朵嘶叫着，一边殷勤地围着母马轻盈地跳跃。但距离贝蒂还是太远了，让他无法向它扔出套索。这是一个庄严高贵的生灵，浑身透着与生俱来的骄傲和荣耀。令人羡慕的是，它的头高傲而又漫不经心地昂着，一举一动都透着自由，马蹄踏草地时也充满了弹力。贝蒂发现无法让马进入可以使用套索的距离内，而且它已开始后退，警觉性也有所提高之后，便从马鞍上溜了下来，举起步枪，视线越过他那匹母马的背部瞄准目标，显然是想要擦伤这匹马。我心头一紧，不禁为这一高贵生灵的安全而担忧，于是大叫了一声，想让贝蒂住手。但已经来不及了；就在我脱口而出的瞬间，他扣动了扳机。幸运的是，他射得没有像往常那么准，我心满意足地看到那匹黝黑的骏马安然无恙地冲入了树林。","On resuming our march, we came to a pleasant little meadow, surrounded by groves of elms and cottonwood trees, in the midst of which was a fine black horse grazing.Beatte, who was in the advance, beckoned us to halt, and, being mounted on a mare, approached the horse gently, step by step, imitating the whinny of the animal with admirable exactness.The noble courser of the prairie gazed for a time, snuffed the air, neighed, pricked up his ears, and pranced round and round the mare in gallant style; but kept at too great a distance for Beatte to throw the lariat.He was a magnificent object, in all the pride and glory of his nature.It was admirable to see the lofty and airy carriage of his head; the freedom of every movement; the elasticity with which he trod the meadow.Finding it impossible to get within noosing distance, and seeing that the horse was receding and growing alarmed, Beatte slid down from his saddle, levelled his rifle, across the back of his mare, and took aim, with the evident intention of creasing him.I felt a, throb of anxiety for the safety of the noble animal, and called out to Beatte to desist.It was too late; he pulled the trigger as I spoke; luckily he did not shoot with his usual accuracy, and I had the satisfaction to see the coal-black steed dash off unharmed into the forest."
"离开这个山谷的时候，我们沿着起伏的山丘和崎岖的树林上行，这给马匹及骑手都带来了不少麻烦。峡谷里也是红色的土壤，通常还非常陡峭，在下行时，马儿们要四蹄并拢，简直就是滑下去的，然后又要像猫一样蹿上对面。在山谷的灌木丛中，黑刺李和柿子到处可见。我们一行人都急不可待地离开队伍，跑去采摘这些蹩脚的野果——这么长时间以来，大家一直只能吃到动物肉，他们是多么渴望能吃到某些蔬菜类的东西啊！","On leaving this valley, we ascended among broken hills and rugged, ragged forests, equally harassing to horse and rider.The ravines, too, were of red clay, and often so steep that, in descending, the horses would put their feet together and fairly slide down, and then scramble up the opposite side like cats.Here and there, among the thickets in the valleys, we met with sloes and persimmon, and the eagerness with which our men broke from the line of march, and ran to gather these poor fruits, showed how much they craved some vegetable condiment, after living so long exclusively on animal food."
"大约三点半时，我们在草地上的一条小溪边安营扎寨，在那儿我们那些饿得半死的马匹可以吃点儿稀稀拉拉的牧草。由于贝蒂在行程途中猎杀了一头肥硕的母鹿，我们的一个同伴还猎杀了一只硕大的火鸡，因此我们并不缺食物。","About half past three we encamped near a brook in a meadow, where there was some scanty herbage for our half-famished horses.As Beatte had killed a fat doe in the course of the day, and one of our company a fine turkey, we did not lack for provisions."
"那是一个极美的秋夜。太阳落山之后，地平线上抹着一层纯净的苹果绿，这绿色到了一片柔美的湖水那里却渐变渐深，最终转成了青紫色。一抹四周镶着琥珀色和金色的狭长的红褐色云彩飘浮在西方。云彩下面是如钻石般闪烁着纯净光芒的星星。与这番景象相呼应的是各种昆虫的夜曲。所有的叫声混杂在一起，和谐地组成了一段阴沉而又忧伤的乐章。我发现这种音调总是能对我的大脑起到一种舒缓镇静的作用，让它进入安静的冥想状态。","It was a splendid autumnal evening.The horizon, after sunset, was of a clear apple green, rising into a delicate lake which gradually lost itself in a deep purple blue.One narrow streak of cloud, of a mahogany color, edged with amber and gold, floated in the west, and just beneath it was the evening star, shining with the pure brilliancy of a diamond.In unison with this scene, there was an evening concert of insects of various kinds, all blended and harmonized into one sober and somewhat melancholy note, which I have always found to have a soothing effect upon the mind, disposing it to quiet musings."
"接下来的夜晚静谧而美丽。一弯秋季的新月发出暗淡的光芒，月落之后，天边又划过一颗漂亮的流星。那些疲惫的巡逻骑兵围着篝火低声交谈了一阵之后，便早早地躺下休息了，于是整个夜景似乎只属于我一个人。就这样在大草原上露宿，躺着凝视繁星是一件十分惬意的事情；就像是在海上，站在航船的甲板上仰望繁星一样，感觉就像是自己拥有了整个苍穹。在这种孤独的景象中，一个人便会明白，东方的牧羊者是怎样在夜晚看守他们的羊群时和这些美丽的星星相伴，进而成为天文学家的了。无数个夜晚，当凝视它们温柔的光芒时，我脑海中不禁会浮现出约伯优雅的语句：“你能系住昴星的结，或是解开参星的带吗？”不知是什么缘故，我感觉今晚特别能感受到天空的庄严肃穆。当这样躺在空旷的苍穹之下时，我似乎是在吸入纯净无污染的空气，精神倍感愉快，甚至有些陶醉。我时睡时醒，当我睡着时，梦中也会带着醒着时那种想入非非的喜悦。天快亮时，一个哨兵过来坐在我身旁，他是队伍中年龄最大的一个。他又累又困，迫不及待地想要换岗。我发现他之前也凝视过天空，但感受却不一样。","The night that succeeded was calm and beautiful.There was a faint light from the moon, now in its second quarter, and after it had set, a fine starlight, with shooting meteors.The wearied rangers, after a little murmuring conversation round their fires, sank to rest at an early hour, and I seemed to have the whole scene to myself.It is delightful, in thus bivouacking on the prairies, to lie awake and gaze at the stars; it is like watching them from the deck of a ship at sea when at one view we have the whole cope of heaven.One realizes, in such lonely scenes, that companionship with these beautiful luminaries which made astronomers of the eastern shepherds, as they watched their flocks by night.How often, while contemplating their mild and benignant radiance, I have called to mind the exquisite text of Job: “Canst thou bind the secret influences of the Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?”I do not know why it was, but I felt this night unusually affected by the solemn magnificence of the firmament; and seemed, as I lay thus under the open vault of heaven, to inhale with the pure untainted air, an exhilarating buoyancy of spirit, and, as it were, an ecstasy of mind.I slept and waked alternately; and when I slept, my dreams partook of the happy tone of my waking reveries.Toward morning, one of the sentinels, the oldest man in the troop, came and took a seat near me; he was weary and sleepy, and impatient to be relieved.I found he had been gazing at the heavens also, but with different feelings."
"“如果星星没有欺骗我的话，”他说，“那天快亮了。”","“If the stars don’t deceive me,” said he, “it is near day-break.”"
"“这毫无疑问，”躺在旁边的贝蒂说，“我刚刚听到一只猫头鹰叫了。”","“There can be no doubt of that,” said Beatte, who lay close by.“I heard an owl just now.”"
"“那么，猫头鹰是在黎明时叫吗？”我问道。","“Does the owl, then, hoot toward daybreak?” asked I."
"“是的，先生，就像公鸡打鸣一样。”","“Aye, sir, just as the cock crows.”"
"这是我之前没有意识到的关于鸟类习惯的有用知识。星星和猫头鹰都没有欺骗相信它们的追随者。不久之后，东方就出现了一道微弱的亮光。","This was a useful habitude of the bird of wisdom, of which I was not aware.Neither the stars nor owl deceived their votaries.In a short time there was a faint streak of light in the east."

"——食物短缺——坏天气——疲惫的行军——一座猎手的桥","—SCARCITY OF PROVISIONS.—BAD WEATHER.—WEARY MARCHING.—A HUNTER’S BRIDGE."
"今天（11月2日）上午经过的区域不再那么崎岖了，景色也比我们之前走过的地方更加宜人。十一点时，我们抵达了一片广阔的大草原，看到在左侧大约六英里处有一条绿色的林带——那是阿肯色河北支流的标志。在这片大草原边缘，一个用参天大树隐藏着一条小溪的宽敞树林里，有着一处废弃的克里克人狩猎营地的痕迹。这些树的树皮上，有用木炭胡乱画的猎人和印第安女子的图像，还有各种记号和象形文字。我们的混血儿们解释说，这表示猎人们是从这个营地回家的。","The country through which we passed this morning (November 2d), was less rugged, and of more agreeable aspect than that we had lately traversed.At eleven o’clock, we came out upon an extensive prairie, and about six miles to our left beheld a long line of green forest, marking the course of the north fork of the Arkansas.On the edge of the prairie, and in a spacious grove of noble trees which overshadowed a small brook, were the traces of an old Creek hunting camp.On the bark of the trees were rude delineations of hunters and squaws, scrawled with charcoal; together with various signs and hieroglyphics, which our half-breeds interpreted as indicating that from this encampment the hunters had returned home."
"就在这片美丽的宿营地，我们午休了一下。在树下休息时，我们听到不远处传来叫喊声。很快，前两天被我们留在后面的队长和大部分骑手出现了在灌木丛中。他们跨过小溪，被我们兴高采烈地接入营地。队长和医生并没有找到他们的马匹，所以不得不在大部分时间里步行；不过他们还是以比平时更快的速度赶了上来。","In this beautiful camping ground we made our mid-day halt.While reposing under the trees, we heard a shouting at no great distance, and presently the Captain and the main body of rangers, whom we had left behind two days since, emerged from the thickets, and crossing the brook, were joyfully welcomed into the camp.The Captain and the Doctor had been unsuccessful in the search after their horses, and were obliged to march for the greater part of the time on foot; yet they had come on with more than ordinary speed."
"我们在大约一点时重新踏上了征程，继续向东走，逐渐斜着靠近北支流。当我们找到一个比较好的宿营地时，天色已经很晚了。这里的河床都干涸了，这个大草原上也有许多地方被印第安狩猎队放火烧过了。最终，我们在一个小冲积河谷里找到了水，那里好歹也有些牧草。","We resumed our march about one o’clock, keeping easterly, and approaching the north fork obliquely; it was late before we found a good camping place; the beds of the streams were dry, the prairies, too, had been burnt in various places, by Indian hunting parties.At length we found water in a small alluvial bottom, where there was tolerable pasturage."
"第二天早上，东方的天空中出现了闪电，响起了低沉沉的隆隆雷声，乌云开始在地平线周围聚集。贝蒂预言说要下雨了，风向将转北。在行进过程中，一群黑雁从北方飞来，掠过我们的头顶。“风来了！”贝蒂说。风确实几乎立刻开始从那个方向吹来，不时夹杂着阵阵雨点。大约九点半时，我们涉水过了加拿大人河的北支流，一点左右就安营扎寨了，以便猎手有时间到周围地区搜寻猎物，因为整个营地开始严重缺乏食物了。大多数的巡逻骑兵都年轻、冒失、没有经验。在食物还充足时，我们就劝他们把肉切成长条晒干，驮些在各自的马背上，以备将来不时之需，但他们却不听。每次离开一个营地时，他们便会把大量的肉扔得到处都是，相信上帝和步枪会在将来为自己提供食物。结果便是，任何暂时性的猎物匮乏或是狩猎时运气不好，几乎都会在营地里引发一场饥荒。例如这次，他们把许多野牛肉留在大草原上的营地里，又由于一直急于行军，没有时间打猎，所以现在食物短缺，只能忍饥挨饿。有些人从前一天早上开始便没吃过一丁点儿东西了。在野牛营地里狂吃大嚼的时候，他们才不会相信这么快就会遭受这种饥饿之苦。","On the following morning there were flashes of lightning in the east, with low, rumbling thunder, and clouds began to gather about the horizon.Beatte prognosticated rain, and that the wind would veer to the north.In the course of our march, a flock of brant were seen overhead, flying from the north.“There comes the wind!” said Beatte; and, in fact, it began to blow from that quarter almost immediately, with occasional flurries of rain.About half past nine o’clock, we forded the north fork of the Canadian, and encamped about one, that our hunters might have time to beat up the neighborhood for game; for a serious scarcity began to prevail in the camp.Most of the rangers were young, heedless, and inexperienced, and could not be prevailed upon, while provisions abounded, to provide for the future, by jerking meat, or carry away any on their horses.On leaving an encampment, they would leave quantities of meat lying about, trusting to Providence and their rifles for a future supply.The consequence was, that any temporary scarcity of game, or ill-luck in hunting, produced almost a famine in the camp.In the present instance, they had left loads of buffalo meat at the camp on the great prairie; and, having ever since been on a forced march, leaving no time for hunting, they were now destitute of supplies, and pinched with hunger.Some had not eaten anything since the morning of the preceding day.Nothing would have persuaded them, when revelling in the abundance of the buffalo encampment, that they would so soon be in such famishing plight."
"猎手们回来了，结果很不理想。猎物早已被比我们早到的印第安人狩猎队吓得跑出这片区域了。十几只野火鸡被带了回来，但一头鹿也没看见。巡逻骑兵们开始留意火鸡，甚至草原松鸡。一直以来，他们都认为这种猎物是不值得开枪的。","The hunters returned with indifferent success.The game had been frightened away from this part of the country by Indian hunting parties, which had preceded us.Ten or a dozen wild turkeys were brought in, but not a deer had been seen.The rangers began to think turkeys and even prairie-hens deserving of attention; game which they had hitherto considered unworthy of their rifles."
"晚上很冷，风很大，不时也会有零星的雨点落下。但是，我们生起了熊熊的篝火，所以还算舒适。晚上，一群大雁飞过营地，在空中呱呱地高声叫着，预示着冬天将要来临了。","The night was cold and windy, with occasional sprinklings of rain; but we had roaring fires to keep us comfortable.In the night, a flight of wild geese passed over the camp, making a great cackling in the air; symptoms of approaching winter."
"第二天早上我们很早便出发了，朝东北方向沿着一伙克里克印第安人的足迹前进，这样便可以使我们可怜的马儿们走起来轻松一点儿。我们踏进了一片漂亮的原野。在一块隆起的高地上，我们看到了一幅壮观的景象：广阔的大草原上匀称地点缀着各种树林，远方环绕着连绵的小山，所有的一切都抹着一层多姿多彩而又柔和的秋色。猎物也更多了。我们右侧的草丛中跃出一头漂亮的雄鹿，并全速飞奔而去。一个叫奇尔德斯的年轻巡逻骑兵站在地上，端起步枪朝它开了一枪，子弹打断了这头跳跃的鹿的脖子，使它脑袋前倾扑倒在地上。在停下来休息之前，人们又猎杀了一头雄鹿和一头母鹿，还有几只火鸡。于是，饥饿的队伍又获得食物了。","We set forward at an early hour the next morning, in a northeast course, and came upon the trace of a party of Creek Indians, which enabled our poor horses to travel with more ease.We entered upon a fine champaign country.From a rising ground we had a noble prospect, over extensive prairies, finely diversified by groves and tracts of woodland, and bounded by long lines of distant hills, all clothed with the rich mellow tints of autumn.Game, too, was more plenty.A fine buck sprang up from among the herbage on our right, and dashed off at full speed; but a young ranger by the name of Childers, who was on foot, levelled his rifle, discharged a ball that broke the neck of the bounding deer, and sent him tumbling head over heels forward.Another buck and a doe, besides several turkeys, were killed before we came to a halt, so that the hungry mouths of the troop were once more supplied."
"急行了二十五英里后，大约三点时，我们在一个小树林里扎起了营。之前的这段路对马匹来说确实是个严峻的考验。队伍的领头半部分扎营完毕后很久，后面部分的人才不时三三两两地进入营地。我们的一匹驮马大约在九英里前就精疲力竭了，不久之后，贝蒂的一匹矮种马也累得不行了。许多其余的马看起来也很憔悴、虚弱，我们开始怀疑它们能否撑到要塞。晚上下起了大雨，黎明时天气也是乌云密布。但是，营地里还是又洋溢起了以前的那种快乐。巡逻骑兵们昨晚吃得很好，精神也恢复了，都期待着尽快抵达要塞。我们启程前，贝蒂艰难地带着他那匹矮种马回到了营地。然而，那匹驮马彻底累垮了，我们不得不将它抛弃。那匹野母马生下了小马，加上一路奔走的疲劳，也没法继续前进了。因此，它和那匹矮种马被留在了这个营地里。这儿有水及很好的牧草，它们有可能会恢复体力，我们以后或许还能再找到它们，把它们带回要塞。","About three o’clock we encamped in a grove after a forced march of twenty-five miles, that had proved a hard trial to the horses.For a long time after the head of the line had encamped, the rest kept straggling in, two and three at a time; one of our pack-horses had given out, about nine miles back, and a pony belonging to Beatte, shortly after.Many of the other horses looked so gaunt and feeble, that doubts were entertained of their being able to reach the fort.In the night there was heavy rain, and the morning dawned cloudy and dismal.The camp resounded, however, with something of its former gayety.The rangers had supped well, and were renovated in spirits, anticipating a speedy arrival at the garrison.Before we set forward on our march, Beatte returned, and brought his pony to the camp with great difficulty.The pack-horse, however, was completely knocked up and had to be abandoned.The wild mare, too, had cast her foal, through exhaustion, and was not in a state to go forward.She and the pony, therefore, were left at this encampment, where there was water and good pasturage; and where there would be a chance of their reviving, and being afterward sought out and brought to the garrison."
"我们在八点左右启程，劳神费力地走了一天。有时要翻过崎岖的山丘，有时要穿越起伏的大草原。雨水使得土地变得又滑又湿，所以我们的坐骑总是立足不稳。一些巡逻骑兵下了马，他们的马匹已经没有力气驮他们了。我们在上午的行程中停顿了一下，马儿们却累得连吃草的力气都没有了。其中几匹躺了下来，很难让它们重新站起来。我们的队伍呈现出一片愁苦不堪的面貌，艰难地缓缓前进。整个队伍稀稀拉拉地行走在长达三英里的山丘和河谷之间，拉成了长长的一溜。人们三四个一组，各组之间隔得很远；有的骑在马背上，有的步行，还有几个落伍者远远地落在后面。四点钟左右，我们在一片宽阔的树林里停了下来，准备过夜。树林旁有一条很深很窄的河流，名叫利特尔北支流或是“深深的克里克”。大部队好不容易进入营地时，天色已经很晚了，许多马匹已经精疲力竭了。由于溪水太深，我们涉不过去，所以只好等到第二天早上再想办法过去。但几个混血儿却在晚上牵着马匹游到了对岸，以让它们吃到更好的牧草，河水也显然在上涨。夜晚很冷，天气十分恶劣。寒风呼啸着穿过树林，卷起了干燥的树叶，在空中打着转儿。我们用巨大的树干生起了很旺的火，这虽然没能让大家高兴起来，至少也给我们带来了些许安慰。","We set off about eight o’clock, and had a day of weary and harassing travel; part of the time over rough hills, and part over rolling prairies.The rain had rendered the soil slippery and plashy, so as to afford unsteady foothold.Some of the rangers dismounted, their horses having no longer strength to bear them.We made a halt in the course of the morning, but the horses were too tired to graze.Several of them lay down, and there was some difficulty in getting them on their feet again.Our troop presented a forlorn appearance, straggling slowly along, in a broken and scattered line, that extended over hill and dale, for three miles and upward, in groups of three and four, widely apart; some on horseback, some on foot, with a few laggards far in the rear.About four o’clock, we halted for the night in a spacious forest, beside a deep narrow river, called the Little North Fork, or Deep Creek.It was late before the main part of the troop straggled into the encampment, many of the horses having given out.As this stream was too deep to be forded, we waited until the next day to devise means to cross it; but our half-breeds swam the horses of our party to the other side in the evening, as they would have better pasturage, and the stream was evidently swelling.The night was cold and unruly; the wind sounding hoarsely through the forest and whirling about the dry leaves.We made long fires of great trunks of trees, which diffused something of consolation if not cheerfulness around."
"第二天上午，队长允许大家出去打猎，十二点前回来就行，因为营地的食物又不够了。我们安营扎寨的林木茂密的低洼地有大量的野火鸡，大家猎杀了许多。同时，我们也在为过河做准备，而河水一夜之间涨了好几英尺；我们决定砍倒一些树当桥梁用。","The next morning there was general permission given to hunt until twelve o’clock; the camp being destitute of provisions.The rich woody bottom in which we were encamped abounded with wild turkeys, of which a considerable number were killed.In the meantime, preparations were made for crossing the river, which had risen several feet during the night; and it was determined to fell trees for the purpose, to serve as bridges."
"队长、医生及营地其他的一两个首领都很精通木活，他们用专业眼光检查长在河岸边的树，最终挑出了几棵最大、倾斜角度也最合适的树。然后，斧头便有力地砍在了树根上，以确保树倒下后可以直接横跨河面。由于它们长度不够，到不了对岸，所以需要一些人游过去砍倒对面的树，使它们接起来。他们最终踩着河底，摇摇晃晃地穿过了这又深又急的河水，顺便把一些可以带走的包裹带了过去。可我们却仍需小心翼翼、一步一步地沿着树干和主枝前进。一部分树干完全没入了水中，水一直淹到我们的腰部。然后，大多数的马都游了过去，但也有一些太虚弱了，不敢下到水流中去，显然是精疲力竭，不能再前进了。因此，队长命令十二个人留下来看护这些马，直到它们通过休息和放牧恢复足够的体力来走完全程。队长答应，我们一到达要塞，他便会派人给他们送来面粉和其他必需品。","The Captain and Doctor, and one or two other leaders of the camp, versed in woodcraft, examined, with learned eye, the trees growing on the river bank, until they singled out a couple of the largest size, and most suitable inclinations.The axe was then vigorously applied to their roots, in such a way as to insure their falling directly across the stream.As they did not reach to the opposite bank, it was necessary for some of the men to swim across and fell trees on the other side, to meet them.They at length succeeded in making a precarious footway across the deep and rapid current, by which the baggage could be carried over; but it was necessary to grope our way, step by step, along the trunks and main branches of the trees, which for a part of the distance were completely submerged, so that we were to our waists in water.Most of the horses were then swam across, but some of them were too weak to brave the current, and evidently too much knocked up to bear any further travel.Twelve men, therefore, were left at the encampment to guard these horses, until, by repose and good pasturage, they should be sufficiently recovered to complete their journey; and the Captain engaged to send the men a supply of flour and other necessaries, as soon as we should arrive at the fort."

"——艰苦的旅行及饥饿的停顿——一个边疆农舍——到达要塞","—HARD TRAVELLING AND HUNGRY HALTING.—A FRONTIER FARMHOUSE.—ARRIVAL AT THE GARRISON."
"一点多一点儿时，我们再次开始了疲惫的行程。那天余下的时间及接下来的一整天，我们都在进行辛苦的旅行。我们在路上翻过了一些乱世嶙峋的山岗，穿过几个被刚下的一场雨弄得湿软而又泥泞的、广阔的大草原。在大草原上，我们还不时被涨成洪流的小河阻断了去路。我们那些可怜的马匹非常虚弱，我们费了好大劲儿才带它们穿过了很深的峡谷及湍急的水流。在穿行泥泞的草原上时，它们每走一步都蹄底打滑，踉踉跄跄。所以，我们大多数人不得不下马，步行完成大部分的行程。整个队伍都非常饥饿，每个人看起来都开始变得焦虑、憔悴，觉得每多走一英里，路就会变得更长。有一次，在翻越一座山丘时，贝蒂爬到一棵很高的树上放眼远眺，就像海上爬上桅顶的水手一样。他下来后，带来了令人振奋的消息。他看到在左侧绵延着一条林带，他知道那就是阿肯色河边缘的林带。他还认出了远处一些界标。由此，他总结说，我们距离要塞不超过四十英里。大家发出了像在海上颠簸飘摇的水手看到陆地一样的叫喊声。","It was a little after one o’clock when we again resumed our weary wayfaring.The residue of that day and the whole of the next were spent in toilsome travel.Part of the way was over stony hills, part across wide prairies, rendered spongy and miry by the recent rain, and cut up by brooks swollen into torrents.Our poor horses were so feeble, that it was with difficulty we could get them across the deep ravines and turbulent streams.In traversing the miry plains, they slipped and staggered at every step, and most of us were obliged to dismount and walk for the greater part of the way.Hunger prevailed throughout the troop; every one began to look anxious and haggard, and to feel the growing length of each additional mile.At one time, in crossing a hill, Beatte climbed a high tree, commanding a wide prospect, and took a look-out, like a mariner from the mast-head at sea.He came down with cheering tidings.To the left he had beheld a line of forest stretching across the country, which he knew to be the woody border of the Arkansas; and at a distance he had recognized certain landmarks, from which he concluded that we could not be above forty miles distant from the fort.It was like the welcome cry of land to tempest-tossed mariners."
"实际上，我们很快便看到远处葱茏的山谷中有烟飘起。那应该是要塞附近一支克里克人或是奥塞奇印第安人的狩猎队生的火。大家都欢呼起来，因为我们终于看到人的踪迹了。我们现在信心满满地认为，很快便可以到达散落在这片无人居住的荒原边缘的克里克印第安人的边疆村落了。而饥饿而步履沉重的巡逻骑兵们也精神大振，热切地期盼着农家的美味佳肴。他们细数着每一样可口诱人的佳肴，直到对这顿想象中的盛宴垂涎欲滴。","In fact we soon after saw smoke rising from a woody glen at a distance.It was supposed to be made by a hunting-party of Creek or Osage Indians from the neighborhood of the fort, and was joyfully hailed as a harbinger of man.It was now confidently hoped that we would soon arrive among the frontier hamlets of Creek Indians, which are scattered along the skirts of the uninhabited wilderness; and our hungry rangers trudged forward with reviving spirit, regaling themselves with savory anticipations of farmhouse luxuries, and enumerating every article of good cheer, until their mouths fairly watered at the shadowy feasts thus conjured up."
"然而，在结束了鞍马劳顿的一天之后，等待我们的却是一个饥饿的夜晚。我们在阿肯色河的一条支流的河岸上扎了营。营地建在了一个已被飓风摧残、颇具规模的小树林的残迹之上。一小股疾风从树林中强行穿过，一路上令许多树瑟瑟发抖，折断了许多树枝，甚至将一些树连根拔起，只留下树根在空中飞舞；所有的树都倒向同一个方向，就像是那些被猎人踏倒的、易碎易折的芦苇一样。","A hungry night, however, closed in upon a toilsome day.We encamped on the border of one of the tributary streams of the Arkansas, amidst the ruins of a stately grove that had been riven by a hurricane.The blast had torn its way through the forest in a narrow column, and its course was marked by enormous trees shivered and splintered, and upturned, with their roots in the air; all lay in one direction, like so many brittle reeds broken and trodden down by the hunter."
"在这儿，我们不必费力用斧子砍伐树木便有足够的燃料。很快篝火便在这寒冷的空气中熊熊燃烧起来，照亮了整个树林。但是，唉！我们没有肉可以烤。营地里食物短缺几乎要发展成饥荒了。除了那些带着少量风干肉条，或者甚至是带着上一顿中啃了一半的骨头的人之外，其余人都很不开心。至于我们，我们比隔壁那些人幸运多了，我们中有一个人打到了一只火鸡。我们既没有面包就着吃，也没有盐当作料。我们只是把它放到水中简单地煮一煮，然后把水当成汤来喝，而拿着每一小块鸡肉在空荡荡的盐袋里刮来刮去，希望可以刮上某个盐粒，给这清淡无味的鸡肉添些滋味。","Here was fuel in abundance, without the labor of the axe; we had soon immense fires blazing and sparkling in the frosty air, and lighting up the whole forest; but, alas! we had no meat to cook at them.The scarcity in the camp almost amounted to famine.Happy was he who had a morsel of jerked meat, or even the half-picked bones of a former repast.For our part, we were more lucky at our mess than our neighbors; one of our men having shot a turkey.We had no bread to eat with it, nor salt to season it withal.It was simply boiled in water; the latter was served up as soup, and we were fain to rub each morsel of the turkey on the empty salt-bag, in hopes some saline particle might remain to relieve its insipidity."
"当晚非常寒冷，我们周围的所有物体都覆盖上了一层冰晶，皎洁的月光洒在上面，闪闪发光。我们所躺的毛皮周围的水也结冰了。第二天早上，我发现裹着自己的毯子上覆盖着一层白色的冰霜；但我却从未睡得这么舒适过。","The night was biting cold; the brilliant moonlight sparkled on the frosty crystals which covered every object around us.The water froze beside the skins on which we bivouacked, and in the morning I found the blanket in which I was wrapped covered with a hoar frost; yet I had never slept more comfortably."
"吃完了一顿由几块鸡骨头和一杯没有糖的咖啡组成的简单早餐之后，我们便早早地撤营上路了，因为饥饿是旅行灵敏的加速器。包括那些高高的野草在内，整个大草原都披着一层霜，在阳光下闪闪发光。我们看到大群大群的草原鸡或盘旋在林木间，或成排地蹲在光秃秃的树枝上，等着太阳融化野草及牧草上的冰霜。我们的巡逻骑兵们再也不会对这种低等猎物不屑一顾了，而是跑出队伍，像以前追逐鹿一样急切地追着这些松鸡。","After a shadow of a breakfast, consisting of turkey bones and a cup of coffee without sugar, we decamped at an early hour; for hunger is a sharp quickener on a journey.The prairies were all gemmed with frost, that covered the tall weeds and glistened in the sun.We saw great flights of prairie-hens, or grouse, that hovered from tree to tree, or sat in rows along the naked branches, waiting until the sun should melt the frost from the weeds and herbage.Our rangers no longer despised such humble game, but turned from the ranks in pursuit of a prairie-hen as eagerly as they formerly would go in pursuit of a deer."
"现在，每一个人都急切地前进着，焦急地盼望着可以在天黑前抵达某个人类居住的地方。这些可怜的马匹们虽然已经没有多少力气了，骑手们还是一个劲儿地催促着它们前进，因为他们认为很快就能通过休息和足够的草料来补偿它们现在的劳累了。但距离似乎比之前想象的更远了，我们用来作为路标的地平线上的青山也随着我们的前进而后退着。我们的每一步都变得很艰辛，不时还会有可怜的马匹筋疲力尽地累倒在地。它的主人几乎费尽力气才能把它扶起来，并把它强行牵到河岸上可能会有稀疏牧草的某条河的河边，然后留它在那里听天由命。在这些被这样留在路上的坐骑中就有伯爵的一匹备用马。作为主要的猎手，伯爵在追逐野马时总是一马当先。然而，我们打算一抵达要塞便马上派出一队人带着谷物，把可以存活下来的马匹带回去。","Every one now pushed forward, anxious to arrive at some human habitation before night.The poor horses were urged beyond their strength, in the thought of soon being able to indemnify them for present toil, by rest and ample provender.Still the distances seemed to stretch out more than ever, and the blue hills, pointed out as landmarks on the horizon, to recede as we advanced.Every step became a labor; every now and then a miserable horse would give out and lie down.His owner would raise him by main strength, force him forward to the margin of some stream, where there might be a scanty border of herbage, and then abandon him to his fate.Among those that were thus left on the way, was one of the led horses of the Count; a prime hunter, that had taken the lead of every thing in the chase of the wild horses.It was intended, however as soon as we should arrive at the fort, to send out a party provided with corn, to bring in such of the horses as should survive."
"上午的行程中，我们发现了印第安人的足迹，在不同的方向上相互交叉，这证明我们一定是已经处在人类居住区的边缘了。最终，在穿越一个树林的边缘时，我们看到了两三间木屋掩映在大草原边界上的高大树木下。这些木屋是克里克印第安人的住房，旁边紧挨着一些小农田。即使是那些到处都是奢侈品这一现代文明产物的奢华别墅，也得不到我们此时此刻所给予这些小木屋的热烈欢呼。","In the course of the morning, we came upon Indian tracks, crossing each other in various directions, a proof that we must be in the neighborhood of human habitations.At length, on passing through a skirt of wood, we beheld two or three log houses, sheltered under lofty trees on the border of a prairie, the habitations of Creek Indians, who had small farms adjacent.Had they been sumptuous villas, abounding with the luxuries of civilization, they could not have been hailed with greater delight."
"一些巡逻骑兵骑上前去向他们讨要食物；而大部分人则继续前进，寻找白人居住的地方。有人告诉我们白人居住的地方离这儿也不远。队伍很快便消失在树林中，我则沿着他们的踪迹缓慢前进，因为我那匹原本敏捷宽厚的坐骑此时已经步履蹒跚，每一步都走得很艰难。而我也已疲惫不堪，没有力气下马步行了。","Some of the rangers rode up to them in quest of food; the greater part, however, pushed forward in search of the habitation of a white settler, which we were told was at no great distance.The troop soon disappeared among the trees, and I followed slowly in their track; for my once fleet and generous steed faltered under me, and was just able to drag one foot after the other, yet I was too weary and exhausted to spare him."
"我们就以这种方式缓慢前进着，直到转过一片茂密的树丛时，一间边疆农舍突然映入我们的眼帘。那是一间被几棵参天大树所遮蔽的低矮木屋，但它的周围却似乎是一片富足与安逸之地。这儿有一个马厩和牲口棚，还有几个装满稻谷的粮仓，而哼哼叫唤的猪群、咯咯叫着的火鸡和母鸡，以及趾高气扬的公鸡在这个农家庭院里成群结队地闲逛着。","In this way we crept on, until, on turning a thick clump of trees, a frontier farmhouse suddenly presented itself to view.It was a low tenement of logs, overshadowed by great forest trees, but it seemed as if a very region of Cocaigne prevailed around it.Here was a stable and barn, and granaries teeming with abundance, while legions of grunting swine, gobbling turkeys, cackling hens and strutting roosters, swarmed about the farmyard."
"我的那匹疲惫不堪、饿得半死的马，听到这熟悉的声音后，不禁抬起头，竖起了耳朵。它喉咙里发出一声咕噜声，像是一声干笑，然后迅速地摆动着尾巴，朝一个装满金黄玉米穗的仓库凑了过去。我费了好大力气才阻止住它，把它驱赶到木屋的门口。仅仅往里面一瞥，便足以勾起我全部的食欲。巡逻骑兵的队长和他手下的军官们正围坐在一个三条腿的桌子旁，桌上摆着满满的一盘热气腾腾的煮牛肉和芜菁。我立刻翻身下马，把它松开任由它跑向装满玉米的仓库，自己则走进了这座食物丰盛的“宫殿”。一个脾气很好的、胖胖的黑女人在门口迎接了我。她是这间房子的女主人，她的丈夫是个白人，现在不在家。我称赞她是这个荒野中的一个黑精灵，可以突然在荒漠中变出一桌丰盛的美食，而这美食又确确实实摆在我们面前。转瞬间，她从火堆里拽出一个大铁锅，这个铁锅能与埃及著名的烧肉锅，或是《麦克白》中女巫的大锅相媲美。把一只陶制的棕色盘子放在地上之后，她又把那只硕大的锅的一侧斜了过来，从里面倒出各式各样的大块牛肉，紧接着是一大堆芜菁，然后是满满的一盘肉汤。她咧着嘴笑着把这个端给我，并为这简单的食物及盛食物的粗陋餐具而感到抱歉。简单的食物！粗陋的餐具！煮牛肉和芜菁，还有盛它们的陶制盘子！向一个来自大草原的饿得半死的人送上这样的美味佳肴，还有那些美妙的面包和黄油，难道还需要感到抱歉吗？老天啊，这简直是盛宴啊！","My poor jaded and half-famished horse raised his head and pricked up his ears at the well-known sights and sounds.He gave a chuckling inward sound, something like a dry laugh; whisked his tail, and made great leeway toward a corn-crib, filled with golden ears of maize, and it was with some difficulty that I could control his course, and steer him up to the door of the cabin.A single glance within was sufficient to raise every gastronomic faculty.There sat the Captain of the rangers and his officers, round a three-legged table, crowned by a broad and smoking dish of boiled beef and turnips.I sprang off my horse in an instant, cast him loose to make his way to the corn-crib, and entered this palace of plenty.A fat good-humored negress received me at the door.She was the mistress of the house, the spouse of the white man, who was absent.I hailed her as some swart fairy of the wild, that had suddenly conjured up a banquet in the desert; and a banquet was it in good sooth.In a twinkling, she lugged from the fire a huge iron pot, that might have rivalled one of the famous flesh-pots of Egypt, or the witches’ caldron in Macbeth.Placing a brown earthen dish on the floor, she inclined the corpulent caldron on one side, and out leaped sundry great morsels of beef, with a regiment of turnips tumbling after them, and a rich cascade of broth overflowing the whole.This she handed me with an ivory smile that extended from ear to ear; apologizing for our humble fare, and the humble style in which it was served up.Humble fare! humble style!Boiled beef and turnips, and an earthen dish to eat them from!To think of apologizing for such a treat to a half-starved man from the prairies; and then such magnificent slices of bread and butter!Head of Apicius, what a banquet!"
"“饥饿之火”被平息之后，我才想起了我的马。然而，它就像一个老兵一样，把自己照顾得很好。我发现它专注地围着盛放印第安玉米的仓库，灵巧地从栅栏间将突出来的玉米穗挑出来嚼着吃。我很抱歉地打断了它享用美餐，而它只得长叹一口气，确切地说是叽里咕噜地抱怨了一阵，便不情愿地离开了。然而，我急切地想要和我的旅行同伴们会合。他们经过这个农舍时并没有停留，而是继续向阿肯色河河岸前进，希望可以在天黑前抵达奥塞奇事务所。因此，我离开了决定在这个食物丰盛的农家过夜的队长及他的部队，向我们的黑皮肤女主人告别，然后继续策马前进。","“The rage of hunger” being appeased, I began to think of my horse.He, however, like an old campaigner, had taken good care of himself.I found him paying assiduous attention to the crib of Indian corn, and dexterously drawing forth and munching the ears that protruded between the bars.It was with great regret that I interrupted his repast, which he abandoned with a heavy sigh, or rather a rumbling groan.I was anxious, however, to rejoin my travelling companions, who had passed by the farmhouse without stopping, and proceeded to the banks of the Arkansas; being in hopes of arriving before night at the Osage Agency.Leaving the Captain and his troop, therefore, amidst the abundance of the farm, where they had determined to quarter themselves for the night, I bade adieu to our sable hostess, and again pushed forward."
"骑了大约一英里后，我来到了穿过一片片美丽森林的阿肯色河的河畔，我的同伴们正在河边等着。一伙衣着鲜艳、看起来像是快活的热带鸟的克里克印第安人，正忙着用一个小舟帮我们的人将包裹运过河去。与此同时，我们的马匹享用了另一场盛宴——河边有两个很大的仓库里堆满了印第安玉米。我们不得不时刻关注着这些饿得半死的可怜牲畜，以防它们因贪吃而伤了身体。","A ride of about a mile brought me to where my comrades were waiting on the banks of the Arkansas, which here poured along between beautiful forests.A number of Creek Indians, in their brightly colored dresses, looking like so many gay tropical birds, were busy aiding our men to transport the baggage across the river in a canoe.While this was doing, our horses had another regale from two great cribs heaped up with ears of Indian corn, which stood near the edge of the river.We had to keep a check upon the poor half-famished animals, lest they should injure themselves by their voracity."
"所有的包裹都被运到对岸后，我们也上了这条小舟，并牵着我们的马，让它们游过河。我很担心，怕这些身体虚弱的马儿们，会顶不住水流的冲击。但是，它们吃的那顿印第安玉米大餐，又使它们充满了力气和精神头。它们看上去很兴奋，似乎本能地意识到马上就要到家了，很快便可以得到休息，吃到丰盛的食物了。所以，我们一上岸恢复行程，它们便开始轻快地飞奔了起来，一直跑了长达七英里的路程，即使在穿越森林时我们也没有下马。","The baggage being all carried to the opposite bank, we embarked in the canoe, and swam our horses across the river.I was fearful, lest in their enfeebled state, they should not be able to stem the current; but their banquet of Indian corn had already infused fresh life and spirit into them, and it would appear as if they were cheered by the instinctive consciousness of their approach to home, where they would soon be at rest, and in plentiful quarters; for no sooner had we landed and resumed our route, than they set off on a hand-gallop, and continued so for a great part of seven miles, that we had to ride through the woods."
"我们傍晚时分便抵达了位于弗迪格里斯河岸的事务所，大约一个月前我们就是在这儿出发的。我们在这儿度过了一个舒适的夜晚，但是习惯了露天宿营之后，房屋的封闭性在某种程度上竟有些令人讨厌。环境似乎是封闭的，也缺乏新鲜空气；当我晚上醒来凝望着四周的一片漆黑时，我不禁怀念起星星那美妙的陪伴来。","It was an early hour in the evening when we arrived at the Agency on the banks of the Verdigris River, whence we had set off about a month before.Here we passed the night comfortably quartered; yet, after having been accustomed to sleep in the open air, the confinement of a chamber was, in some respects, irksome.The atmosphere seemed close, and destitute of freshness; and when I woke in the night and gazed about me upon complete darkness, I missed the glorious companionship of the stars."
"第二天早上，吃完早饭后，我再次出发，陪着可敬的专员前往吉布森要塞。到那儿时，我们全都衣衫褴褛，风尘仆仆，皮肤黝黑，但个个儿都身体健壮，精神抖擞。我的波尼人狩猎场之旅就这样结束了。","The next morning, after breakfast, I again set forward, in company with the worthy Commissioner, for Fort Gibson, where we arrived much tattered, travel-stained, and weather-beaten, but in high health and spirits;—and thus ended my foray into the Pawnee Hunting Grounds."
