"一个离奇的故事","A Strange Story"
"作者：欧•亨利","by O. Henry"
"在奥斯汀市北部曾经居住着诚实的斯马瑟斯一家。约翰·斯马瑟斯一家的家庭成员包括：约翰·斯马瑟斯、他的妻子、他自己、他们五岁的小女儿和女儿的父母；在进行一种特殊的人口记载时，他家一共登记了城市人口六人，但实际上他们家只有三口人。","In the northern part of Austin there once dwelt an honest family by the name of Smothers.The family consisted of John Smothers, his wife, himself, their little daughter, five years of age, and her parents, making six people toward the population of the city when counted for a special write-up, but only three by actual count."
"一天晚饭后，小女孩感觉肚子痛得很厉害，于是约翰·斯马瑟斯急忙赶去城里给女儿买药。","One night after supper the little girl was seized with a severe colic, and John Smothers hurried down town to get some medicine."
"可他再也没有回来。","He never came back."
"小女孩身体逐渐恢复，后来长大成人了。","The little girl recovered and in time grew up to womanhood."
"小女孩的母亲对于丈夫的失踪痛心不已，差不多三个月后才再婚，并搬到了圣安东尼奥市。","The mother grieved very much over her husband’s disappearance, and it was nearly three months before she married again, and moved to San Antonio."
"小女孩终于也结了婚，几年过去了，她也成为了一个五岁女孩的母亲。","The little girl also married in time, and after a few years had rolled around, she also had a little girl five years of age."
"她仍然住在原来的那栋房子里，就是在那里，她的父亲离家后再也没有回来。","She still lived in the same house where they dwelt when her father had left and never returned."
"一天晚上，惊人的巧合在她女儿身上发生了。她的小女儿也感觉腹痛，而那天也恰恰是她的父亲约翰·斯马瑟斯多年前失踪的日子。如果他还活着，有一份稳定的工作，他现在已经是孩子的外公了。","One night by a remarkable coincidence her little girl was taken with cramp colic on the anniversary of the disappearance of John Smothers, who would now have been her grandfather if he had been alive and had a steady job."
"“我要去城里给女儿买药。”约翰·史密斯说（他就是斯马瑟斯女儿的丈夫）。","“I will go downtown and get some medicine for her,” said John Smith (for it was none other than he whom she had married)."
"“不，不行，亲爱的约翰，”他的妻子喊道，“你也可能会永远消失，然后忘了回来。”","“No, no, dear John,” cried his wife.“You, too, might disappear forever, and then forget to come back.”"
"所以约翰·史密斯没有出去，两人一起守坐在小潘西的身边（潘西是小女儿的名字）。","So John Smith did not go, and together they sat by the bedside of little Pansy (for that was Pansy’s name)."
"后来，小潘西的情况似乎越来越糟，约翰·史密斯又要出去买药，但是他的妻子还是没有让他去。","After a little Pansy seemed to grow worse, and John Smith again attempted to go for medicine, but his wife would not let him."
"突然，门开了，一个弯腰驼背、白发苍苍的长发老人走了进来。","Suddenly the door opened, and an old man, stooped and bent, with long white hair, entered the room."
"“您好，是外公。”潘西说。潘西先于他们认出了他。","“Hello, here is grandpa,” said Pansy.She had recognized him before any of the others."
"老人从自己的衣袋里掏出一瓶药，然后给潘西喂了一小勺。","The old man drew a bottle of medicine from his pocket and gave Pansy a spoonful."
"吃了药，她很快就没事了。","She got well immediately."
"“我回来得有些晚了，”约翰·斯马瑟斯说，“我一直在等有轨电车。”","“I was a little late,” said John Smothers, “as I waited for a street car.”"
