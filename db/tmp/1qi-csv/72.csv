"带家具出租的房间","The Furnished Room"
"作者：欧·亨利","by O. Henry"
"住在纽约下西区南边红砖房地区的人中，绝大部分人都像光阴一般不停地流转、居无定所、来去匆匆。虽说他们无家可归，但也可以说他们有上百个家。他们从一间带家具出租的房间搬到另一间带家具出租的房间，永远都是过客——不仅身体上居无定所，心灵和思想上亦然。他们唱着散拍乐的“家，甜美的家”；他们抬着个硬纸箱，里面是他们的全部家当；他们的藤蔓就缠绕在阔边花式帽上，橡胶树就是他们的无花果树。（注：英语中，“居住在藤蔓和无花果树下”表示“生活安定”。）","Restless, shifting, fugacious as time itself is a certain vast bulk of the population of the red brick district of the lower West Side.Homeless, they have a hundred homes.They flit from furnished room to furnished room, transients forever—transients in abode, transients in heart and mind.They sing “Home, Sweet Home” in ragtime; they carry their lares et penates in a bandbox; their vine is entwined about a picture hat; a rubber plant is their fig tree."
"这个地区的房子曾经有上千个房客住过，因此，要讲的故事也应该有上千个，但毫无疑问，其中的大部分都很乏味。可如果说在这些漂泊不定的房客身后找不到一两个魂灵，那才奇怪呢。","Hence the houses of this district, having had a thousand dwellers, should have a thousand tales to tell, mostly dull ones, no doubt; but it would be strange if there could not be found a ghost or two in the wake of all these vagrant guests."
"一天傍晚天黑之后，一位男青年徘徊在这些破烂不堪的红色宅第之间，一家家地按着门铃。按到第十二家门铃的时候，他把少得可怜的手提行李放在门阶上，擦去帽边缎带和前额上的灰尘。门铃的响声微弱而幽远，仿佛是从某些遥远而空荡的深渊中发出来的。","One evening after dark a young man prowled among these crumbling red mansions, ringing their bells.At the twelfth he rested his lean hand-baggage upon the step and wiped the dust from his hatband and forehead.The bell sounded faint and far away in some remote, hollow depths."
"他在这第十二家门口按响门铃后，女房东应声而出。这个女房东让他想起了令人厌恶的、吃多了的蠕虫。它已经吃空了坚果仁，只剩个空壳，现在正寻觅可以充饥的住客来填补空间。","To the door of this, the twelfth house whose bell he had rung, came a housekeeper who made him think of an unwholesome, surfeited worm that had eaten its nut to a hollow shell and now sought to fill the vacancy with edible lodgers."
"他问有没有可以出租的房间。","He asked if there was a room to let."
"“进来吧。”女房东说。她的声音是从喉咙里发出的，喉咙里好像衬着一层毛皮似的。","“Come in,” said the housekeeper.Her voice came from her throat; her throat seemed lined with fur."
"“三楼后面有间房，空了一周了。你想看看吗？”","“I have the third floor back, vacant since a week back.Should you wish to look at it?”"
"那位男青年跟着她上了楼。不知道从哪里进来的一丝微光缓和了走廊里的阴暗。他们一声不响地走在楼梯的地毯上，而地毯破旧得连编织它的织布机也会坚决否认是自己织出来的。地毯仿佛已变成了蔬菜，并已在那种臭烘烘的、阴暗的空气中腐化成茂盛的地衣或铺展开来的苔藓，一片一片地长在楼梯上，人踩在脚下感觉粘得像踩在有机物上似的。楼梯每一个转角处的墙上都有空着的壁龛。也许里面曾放过植物。如果真是如此，那些植物也早已在又脏又臭的空气中死去了。立在壁龛里的也可能是圣人像，但是不难想象，形形色色的魔鬼早就在黑暗中把它们拖了出来，并一直拖到下面某间带家具出租的客房那邪恶的深渊中去了。","The young man followed her up the stairs.A faint light from no particular source mitigated the shadows of the halls.They trod noiselessly upon a stair carpet that its own loom would have forsworn.It seemed to have become vegetable; to have degenerated in that rank, sunless air to lush lichen or spreading moss that grew in patches to the staircase and was viscid under the foot like organic matter.At each turn of the stairs were vacant niches in the wall.Perhaps plants had once been set within them.If so they had died in that foul and tainted air.It may be that statues of the saints had stood there, but it was not difficult to conceive that imps and devils had dragged them forth in the darkness and down to the unholy depths of some furnished pit below."
"“就是这间房，”女房东用她那沙哑的毛皮嗓子说道，“这房间不错。很少空着。去年夏天，入住这间房的都是些特别体面的人——从来没有麻烦事，还提前付房租，特别准时。水在走廊尽头。斯普罗尔斯和穆尼连租了三个月。他们演过杂耍短剧。布雷塔·斯普罗尔斯小姐——可能你听说过她——哦，那只是她的艺名——她那镶了框的结婚证就曾挂在梳妆台上面的这个位置。煤气在这儿，你看壁橱也很宽敞。大家都喜欢住这个房间。这房间从来不会空很久。”","“This is the room,” said the housekeeper, from her furry throat.“It’s a nice room.It ain’t often vacant.I had some most elegant people in it last summer—no trouble at all, and paid in advance to the minute.The water’s at the end of the hall.Sprowls and Mooney kept it three months.They done a vaudeville sketch.Miss B’retta Sprowls—you may have heard of her—Oh, that was just the stage names—right there over the dresser is where the marriage certificate hung, framed.The gas is here, and you see there is plenty of closet room.It’s a room everybody likes.It never stays idle long.”"
"“你这儿住着很多演戏剧的人吗？”那位青年问道。","“Do you have many theatrical people rooming here?” asked the young man."
"“他们总是来了又走了。我的房客中有很大一部分人都从事和戏剧有关的事情。是的，先生，这里是剧院区。演戏的人从来不在任何一个地方长住。我总有我的房客。是的，他们总是来了又走了。”","“They comes and goes.A good proportion of my lodgers is connected with the theatres.Yes, sir, this is the theatrical district.Actor people never stays long anywhere.I get my share.Yes, they comes and they goes.”"
"他租下那间房，先付了一周的租金。他说很累，想马上入住。他点好了钱。她说房间已准备好了，连毛巾和水都准备好了。女房东刚要走开，他提出了那个挂在嘴边的问题，这个问题他问了有一千遍了。","He engaged the room, paying for a week in advance.He was tired, he said, and would take possession at once.He counted out the money.The room had been made ready, she said, even to towels and water.As the housekeeper moved away he put, for the thousandth time, the question that he carried at the end of his tongue."
"“有个年轻姑娘——瓦西纳小姐——艾卢瓦丝·瓦西纳小姐——你记得有过这个房客吗？她很可能是在舞台上唱歌的。这个女孩子皮肤白皙、身材颀长、个头中等，头发金黄泛红，左眉毛边上有一颗黑痣。”","“A young girl—Miss Vashner—Miss Eloise Vashner—do you remember such a one among your lodgers?She would be singing on the stage, most likely.A fair girl, of medium height and slender, with reddish, gold hair and a dark mole near her left eyebrow.”"
"“不，我不记得这个名字。他们演出的人换名字就像换房间一样，太频繁了。他们来了又走了的。不，我不记得这个名字。”","“No, I don’t remember the name.Them stage people has names they change as often as their rooms.They comes and they goes.No, I don’t call that one to mind.”"
"没有。总是没有。五个月来不断地询问，得到的答复总是否定的。已经耗费了这么多时间，白天去找经理、经纪人、学校和合唱团询问，而晚上则夹在剧院的观众群中寻觅，从明星剧团到低俗的杂耍戏院都找遍了，尽管他害怕在那种地方找到他最想找的人。他一心要找到这个他最爱的人。他确信，自打她离家失踪以来，这座四面环水的大城市一定把她藏在了某个地方。但这座城市就像可恶的流沙，沙粒不停地流动，毫无根基，今天还在上层的沙粒明天就被埋在淤泥和黏土里了。","No. Always no.Five months of ceaseless interrogation and the inevitable negative.So much time spent by day in questioning managers, agents, schools and choruses; by night among the audiences of theatres from all-star casts down to music halls so low that he dreaded to find what he most hoped for.He who had loved her best had tried to find her.He was sure that since her disappearance from home this great, water-girt city held her somewhere, but it was like a monstrous quicksand, shifting its particles constantly, with no foundation, its upper granules of to-day buried to-morrow in ooze and slime."
"这间带家具出租的客房虚情假意地迎接着新客，如同满脸假笑的娼妓，兴奋慌乱、面容憔悴、敷衍了事。朽了的家具、长沙发和两把椅子上破烂不堪的锦缎垫子，两扇窗户间一脚宽的廉价劣质的穿衣镜，还有一两个镀金画框和角落里的一个铜床架，所有这一切反射出的微光都带给人一种似是而非的舒适感。","The furnished room received its latest guest with a first glow of pseudo-hospitality, a hectic, haggard, perfunctory welcome like the specious smile of a demirep.The sophistical comfort came in reflected gleams from the decayed furniture, the ragged brocade upholstery of a couch and two chairs, a footwide cheap pier glass between the two windows, from one or two gilt picture frames and a brass bedstead in a corner."
"这位房客慵懒地斜靠在一把椅子上。房间就仿佛是巴别通天塔上的一个套间，里面的人语言混乱，却仍然竭力给他讲述不同房客的故事。","The guest reclined, inert, upon a chair, while the room, confused in speech as though it were an apartment in Babel, tried to discourse to him of its divers tenantry."
"一小块杂色地毯就像某个鲜花盛开的长方形热带岛屿，周围是脏兮兮的垫子组成的波涛汹涌的大海。用颜色鲜艳的壁纸裱过的墙上贴着的那些图画追随着无家可归的人从一间房搬到另一间房——《胡格诺情人》、《第一次争吵》、《婚礼早餐》、《泉边塞姬》。壁炉台的轮廓庄重规整，却被遮羞般地遮掩在无礼的帷帐后面；帷帐被轻佻地撩起，歪歪斜斜的，就像亚马逊芭蕾舞剧里女人用的饰带。壁炉台上有一些废弃物品，都是原先在这里潦倒度日的房客被幸运的船帆载到新港湾时弃置不要的东西——一两个不值钱的花瓶、女演员的肖像画、一个药瓶，还有一些凌乱不全的纸牌。","A polychromatic rug like some brilliant-flowered rectangular, tropical islet lay surrounded by a billowy sea of soiled matting.Upon the gay-papered wall were those pictures that pursue the homeless one from house to house—The Huguenot Lovers, The First Quarrel, The Wedding Breakfast, Psyche at the Fountain.The mantel’s chastely severe outline was ingloriously veiled behind some pert drapery drawn rakishly askew like the sashes of the Amazonian ballet.Upon it was some desolate flotsam cast aside by the room’s marooned when a lucky sail had borne them to a fresh port—a trifling vase or two, pictures of actresses, a medicine bottle, some stray cards out of a deck."
"就像密码字符变得明晰起来一样，在客房里住过的一拨又一拨的房客留下的细小痕迹也变得意义重大。梳妆台前面的小地毯上那块被磨光露白的地方表明有成群的漂亮女人曾经在上面走过。墙上留下的小指纹显示出小囚犯们在努力摸索着通向阳光和空气的道路。一片四溅的污迹，就像炸弹爆炸的影子一般，见证了一个玻璃杯或瓶子连同里面所盛的东西被狠狠地摔碎在墙上的过程。穿衣镜上用金刚石割刀胡乱地刻着几个歪歪扭扭的字母，写着“玛丽”的名字。仿佛客房前前后后的住客们都曾经在暴怒中翻腾——或许是客房那俗不可耐的冷漠气氛让他们忍无可忍——最终将他们的狂怒发泄在客房上。家具破损，伤痕累累；长沙发因弹簧突出而扭曲变形，仿佛是一头在某种怪异的痉挛的压迫下被屠杀的恐怖的怪物。另有一次更有威力的骚动把大理石做的壁炉台劈掉了一大块。地板上的每一块木板都以不同的形态倾斜着，因各自独有的痛苦而发出尖叫声。令人难以置信的是，所有这一切恶意局面和伤害都是一度称这里为家的房客施加给房间的；但是也可能正是那种被蒙骗却盲目坚持的爱家本能，以及对虚伪的家庭守护神灵的怨恨点燃了他们的满腔怒火。一间小屋只要是属于自己的，我们都会去打扫、装饰和珍惜。","One by one, as the characters of a cryptograph become explicit, the little signs left by the furnished room’s procession of guests developed a significance.The threadbare space in the rug in front of the dresser told that lovely woman had marched in the throng.Tiny finger prints on the wall spoke of little prisoners trying to feel their way to sun and air.A splattered stain, raying like the shadow of a bursting bomb, witnessed where a hurled glass or bottle had splintered with its contents against the wall.Across the pier glass had been scrawled with a diamond in staggering letters the name “Marie.”It seemed that the succession of dwellers in the furnished room had turned in fury—perhaps tempted beyond forbearance by its garish coldness—and wreaked upon it their passions.The furniture was chipped and bruised; the couch, distorted by bursting springs, seemed a horrible monster that had been slain during the stress of some grotesque convulsion.Some more potent upheaval had cloven a great slice from the marble mantel.Each plank in the floor owned its particular cant and shriek as from a separate and individual agony.It seemed incredible that all this malice and injury had been wrought upon the room by those who had called it for a time their home; and yet it may have been the cheated home instinct surviving blindly, the resentful rage at false household gods that had kindled their wrath.A hut that is our own we can sweep and adorn and cherish."
"椅子上的这位青年房客任由这些思绪排成纵列，犹如穿软底鞋跳踢跶舞一般飘过脑海，而同时飘进屋里的是这种带家具出租房间特有的声音和气味。他听到一个房间里传来一阵偷笑和一阵无节制的、呆滞的大笑；又从别的房间里传来滔滔不绝的责骂声、掷骰子的呼啦声、摇篮曲的声音和一个人呜呜的哭泣声；在他上头还有人情绪高昂地弹奏班卓琴。不知哪里传来砰砰的关门声；高架电车不时地隆隆驶过；后面的围墙上一只猫凄惨地哀叫着。他呼吸着房子里的气息——这不是什么臭味，而是一种潮湿味——就仿佛是从地下室里发出的那种冰冷的霉臭味，还混杂着油地毡和霉烂的木制品散发的恶臭。","The young tenant in the chair allowed these thoughts to file, soft-shod, through his mind, while there drifted into the room furnished sounds and furnished scents.He heard in one room a tittering and incontinent, slack laughter; in others the monologue of a scold, the rattling of dice, a lullaby, and one crying dully; above him a banjo tinkled with spirit.Doors banged somewhere; the elevated trains roared intermittently; a cat yowled miserably upon a back fence.And he breathed the breath of the house—a dank savour rather than a smell—a cold, musty effluvium as from underground vaults mingled with the reeking exhalations of linoleum and mildewed and rotten woodwork."
"正当他在那里歇息的时候，突然房间里弥漫着木樨草浓烈的芳香。它随一阵风袭来，千真万确，是那样芬芳浓郁，俨然一个生动逼真的座上客。那个青年仿佛有人叫他似的，大叫道：“怎么了，亲爱的？”然后跳起来，四处张望。这股浓香紧紧依附着他，把他围绕在中央。他伸出双臂拥抱香气；他的全部感觉顿时迷乱地交织在了一起。一个人怎么会被一阵香气紧急召唤去了呢？召唤他的肯定是一种声音。可是，这难道不是曾打动过他、安抚过他的声音吗？","Then, suddenly, as he rested there, the room was filled with the strong, sweet odour of mignonette.It came as upon a single buffet of wind with such sureness and fragrance and emphasis that it almost seemed a living visitant.And the man cried aloud: “What, dear?” as if he had been called, and sprang up and faced about.The rich odour clung to him and wrapped him around.He reached out his arms for it, all his senses for the time confused and commingled.How could one be peremptorily called by an odour?Surely it must have been a sound.But, was it not the sound that had touched, that had caressed him?"
"“她在这个房间里住过。”他大喊着，然后跳起来，硬是想搜出一个证据来。因为他知道只要是属于她的或是她触碰过的，哪怕是蛛丝马迹他都一定能辨认出来。木樨草这种沁人心脾的芳香是她曾经喜爱过的，也是她独有的——到底从哪里来的呢？","“She has been in this room,” he cried, and he sprang to wrest from it a token, for he knew he would recognize the smallest thing that had belonged to her or that she had touched.This enveloping scent of mignonette, the odour that she had loved and made her own—whence came it?"
"这个房间只是随便地收拾了一下。薄薄的梳妆台罩上散落着六个发卡——那都是些不引人注目，也无从判断是属于谁的女性朋友用过的东西，虽带有女性特征，但心境不得而知，时间也无法明了。这些东西他都不理不睬，知道它们显然不足以识别身份。他搜遍梳妆台的抽屉，就找到了一条弃之不用的破手帕。他把手帕贴近脸。天芥菜花刺鼻的怪味扑面而来；他使劲把它扔到了地上。他在另一个抽屉里发现了几颗零散的纽扣、一份剧场节目单，一张当铺老板的名片、两颗吃剩的软糖和一本解梦的书。最后一个抽屉里有一个女子用的黑绸缎蝴蝶结发带。这个发带让他愣住了，让他悬在冰与火之间。但是这个黑绸缎蝴蝶结发带也只是表现女性端庄娴静的普通饰品，并不具备个人特征，说明不了什么。","The room had been but carelessly set in order.Scattered upon the flimsy dresser scarf were half a dozen hairpins—those discreet, indistinguishable friends of womankind, feminine of gender, infinite of mood and uncommunicative of tense.These he ignored, conscious of their triumphant lack of identity.Ransacking the drawers of the dresser he came upon a discarded, tiny, ragged handkerchief.He pressed it to his face.It was racy and insolent with heliotrope; he hurled it to the floor.In another drawer he found odd buttons, a theatre programme, a pawnbroker’s card, two lost marshmallows, a book on the divination of dreams.In the last was a woman’s black satin hair bow, which halted him, poised between ice and fire.But the black satin hairbow also is femininity’s demure, impersonal, common ornament, and tells no tales."
"然后他像一条追寻气味的猎犬，在房间里四处搜寻，环视四壁，趴在地上仔细察看拱起垫子的每个角落，搜遍了壁炉台和桌子、帘子和幔帐，以及角落里东倒西歪的橱柜；他想找到一个清晰可见的痕迹，但没有迹象表明她就在他身旁、四周、对面、心中、上方，或是紧紧地缠着他、追求着他，并通过细密的感官向他发出强烈的呼唤，即使他的感官再愚钝也能知晓是她发出的呼唤声。他又一次朗声答到：“是，亲爱的！”然后转过身子瞪大眼睛，却眼神恍惚、一片茫然，因为在木樨草的芳香里，他不能辨明形状、色彩、爱情和张开的双臂。哦，天啊！这芳香来自何方啊？从什么时候起香气也能发出呼唤了？他就这样四处摸索着。","And then he traversed the room like a hound on the scent, skimming the walls, considering the corners of the bulging matting on his hands and knees, rummaging mantel and tables, the curtains and hangings, the drunken cabinet in the corner, for a visible sign, unable to perceive that she was there beside, around, against, within, above him, clinging to him, wooing him, calling him so poignantly through the finer senses that even his grosser ones became cognisant of the call.Once again he answered loudly: “Yes, dear!” and turned, wild-eyed, to gaze on vacancy, for he could not yet discern form and colour and love and outstretched arms in the odour of mnignonette.Oh, God! whence that odour, and since when have odours had a voice to call?Thus he groped."
"他搜遍了每个缝隙和角落，找到了些软木塞和香烟。他对这些都漠不关心、嗤之以鼻。但是，有一次他在垫子的折缝里发现了一支抽了半截的雪茄，他一边用脚后跟把这雪茄给碾碎了，一边狠狠地、尖刻地诅咒了一句。他把房间从头到尾又筛查了一遍。他就找到些微不足道、乏味又不光彩的记录，都是许多来来往往的过客留下的。但是苦苦寻觅的她也可能在这里住宿过，她的灵魂好像还在这里徘徊，而他却找不到任何踪迹。","He burrowed in crevices and corners, and found corks and cigarettes.These he passed in passive contempt.But once he found in a fold of the matting a half-smoked cigar, and this he ground beneath his heel with a green and trenchant oath.He sifted the room from end to end.He found dreary and ignoble small records of many a peripatetic tenant; but of her whom he sought, and who may have lodged there, and whose spirit seemed to hover there, he found no trace."
"这时他想到了女房东。","And then he thought of the housekeeper."
"他从那魂灵萦绕的房间跑到楼下，来到一个透出一线光亮的门口。听到敲门声，她出来了。他竭力克制住自己的激动情绪。","He ran from the haunted room downstairs and to a door that showed a crack of light.She came out to his knock.He smothered his excitement as best he could."
"“ 请告诉我，太太，”他央求她说，“我来之前，谁还住过这个房间？”","“Will you tell me, madam,” he besought her, “who occupied the room I have before I came?”"
"“好吧，先生。 我可以再给你讲一遍。之前住的是斯普罗尔斯和穆尼，我已经说过了。布雷塔·斯普罗尔斯小姐是演戏的，但她正是穆尼夫人。我的房子有着很好的声誉。他们的结婚证还镶了框，挂在钉子上——”","“Yes, sir.I can tell you again.’Twas Sprowls and Mooney, as I said.Miss B’retta Sprowls it was in the theatres, but Missis Mooney she was.My house is well known for respectability.The marriage certificate hung, framed, on a nail over—”"
"“斯普罗尔斯小姐是什么样的女人——我是指在相貌方面？”","“What kind of a lady was Miss Sprowls—in looks, I mean?”"
"哦，先生，她黑头发、矮个子、胖身材，还有一张滑稽好笑的脸。他们是一周前的礼拜二搬走的。”","Why, black-haired, sir, short, and stout, with a comical face.They left a week ago Tuesday.”"
"“那么在他们住这个房间之前呢？”","“And before they occupied it?”"
"“哦，是一位单身的先生，是做赶车运货行当的。他离开时还欠我一周的租金呢。在他之前是克劳德夫人和她的两个孩子，住了四个月；再之前是多伊尔老先生，房租是他的儿子们付的。他连住了六个月。这都追溯到一年之前了，先生，更早的我就记不起来了。”","“Why, there was a single gentleman connected with the draying business.He left owing me a week.Before him was Missis Crowder and her two children, that stayed four months; and back of them was old Mr. Doyle, whose sons paid for him.He kept the room six months.That goes back a year, sir, and further I do not remember.”"
"他谢过了她，然后就慢腾腾地回房去了。房间里死气沉沉的。为它注入活力的香气散去了。 木樨草的芬芳也消散了。取而代之的是发霉的家具散发出的陈腐的臭味，以及储藏室里的霉味。","He thanked her and crept back to his room.The room was dead.The essence that had vivified it was gone.The perfume of mignonette had departed.In its place was the old, stale odour of mouldy house furniture, of atmosphere in storage."
"希望破灭了，他心灰意冷。他坐了下来，盯着咝咝作响的煤气灯发出的黄光。不一会儿，他走到床边，开始把床单撕成一条一条的。然后他用刀刃把这些布条紧紧地塞进门窗周围的每一个缝隙里。当他把所有的缝隙都塞紧以后，他关掉灯，又开足了煤气，最后心存感激地躺在了床上。","The ebbing of his hope drained his faith.He sat staring at the yellow, singing gaslight.Soon he walked to the bed and began to tear the sheets into strips.With the blade of his knife he drove them tightly into every crevice around windows and door.When all was snug and taut he turned out the light, turned the gas full on again and laid himself gratefully upon the bed."
"今晚该麦库尔夫人带着罐子去买啤酒了。她买来啤酒，和珀迪夫人坐在一个隐蔽的地下休息间，这是房东们聚集和蛆虫肆虐的地方。","It was Mrs. McCool’s night to go with the can for beer.So she fetched it and sat with Mrs. Purdy in one of those subterranean retreats where house-keepers foregather and the worm dieth seldom."
" “今晚，我把三楼后面的那间房租出去了。”珀迪夫人说，面前是满满一圈啤酒泡，“一个年轻人租的。两个小时前他就上床睡觉了。”","“I rented out my third floor, back, this evening,” said Mrs. Purdy, across a fine circle of foam.“A young man took it.He went up to bed two hours ago.”"
"“哟，真的吗，珀迪夫人？”麦库尔夫人说，一脸钦佩的神情。“你连那种房子都能租出去，真是厉害啊。那你有没有和他说那件事？”她最后神神秘秘、声音嘶哑地悄声问道。","“Now, did ye, Mrs. Purdy, ma’am?” said Mrs. McCool, with intense admiration.“You do be a wonder for rentin’ rooms of that kind.And did ye tell him, then?” she concluded in a husky whisper, laden with mystery."
"“房间配了家具，”珀迪夫人用她那极为沙哑的毛皮嗓子说道，“就是为了出租的。我没有给他讲，麦库尔夫人。”","“Rooms,” said Mrs. Purdy, in her furriest tones, “are furnished for to rent.I did not tell him, Mrs. McCool.”"
"“太太，你做得对；我们就是靠出租房屋为生的嘛。太太，你真有生意头脑。如果给他们讲房子里有人自杀过，人就死在这个房间的床上，很多人都会拒租的。”","“’Tis right ye are, ma’am; ’tis by renting rooms we kape alive.Ye have the rale sense for business, ma’am.There be many people will rayjict the rentin’ of a room if they be tould a suicide has been after dyin’ in the bed of it.”"
"“就像你说的，我们总得过活吧，”珀迪夫人说。","“As you say, we has our living to be making,” remarked Mrs. Purdy."
"“就是，太太，说得没错。就在一周前的今天我才帮你把三楼后面的那间房收拾出来。太太，一个小小的疏漏，这个姑娘就用煤气把自己给弄死了——她那小脸蛋长得多甜啊，珀迪夫人。”","“Yis, ma’am; ’tis true.’Tis just one wake ago this day I helped ye lay out the third floor, back.A pretty slip of a colleen she was to be killin’ herself wid the gas—a swate little face she had, Mrs. Purdy, ma’am.”"
"“就像你说的，都说她长得俊，”珀迪夫人说，表示赞同但又有些挑剔，“只是她左眉毛边上长了颗痣不大好看。来，再给你满上一杯，麦库尔夫人。”","“She’d a-been called handsome, as you say,” said Mrs. Purdy, assenting but critical, “but for that mole she had a-growin’ by her left eyebrow.Do fill up your glass again, Mrs. McCool.”"
