"第一章 木屋","Chapter I The Chalet"
"一八二九年十月初的一天，公证人西蒙·巴比拉·拉图奈尔先生挽着儿子的手臂，并在夫人的陪同下，从勒阿弗尔步行到安古维尔去。像侍从一样走在他夫人旁边的，是他律师事务所的首席文书。他个子小小的，驼着背，名叫让·比查。他们四人（其中两人每天晚上都会走这条路）来到了路的一个肘弯处，意大利语称之为“檐口”，路到了就反方向折回。他们走到这里时，公证人四下观望了一下，看是否有人能够从上方的阶梯或者下方的小道听到他讲话。为进一步谨慎起见，他说话时嗓门压得很低。","At the beginning of October, 1829, Monsieur Simon Babylas Latournelle, notary, was walking up from Havre to Ingouville, arm in arm with his son and accompanied by his wife, at whose side the head clerk of the lawyer’s office, a little hunchback named Jean Butscha, trotted along like a page.When these four personages (two of whom came the same way every evening) reached the elbow of the road where it turns back upon itself like those called in Italy “cornice,” the notary looked about to see if any one could overhear him either from the terrace above or the path beneath, and when he spoke he lowered his voice as a further precaution."
"“埃克絮佩，”他对儿子说，“我这就告诉你要做什么，你一定要机智地按计划行事，但不要问意图何在。如果你猜到了我的意图，也给我把它抛到冥河里去。每一名律师，每一个想参与本国政府事务的人，心底都应该有这样一条冥河，把别人的秘密深藏其中。一会儿，你先向米尼翁夫人、米尼翁小姐、迪迈先生和迪迈夫人请安。如果哥本海姆先生也在别墅的话，你也要问候他。之后，等大家一安静下来，迪迈先生就会把你带到一边，在他与你说话的过程中，你要一直聚精会神地打量莫黛斯特小姐（是的，我允许你这样做）。之后，我那可敬的朋友会叫你出去散散步。一个小时之后，也就是大约九点钟，你要慌慌张张地跑回来，装作上气不接下气的样子，朝迪迈先生耳语：‘那小伙子来了。’声音要轻，但要确保让莫黛斯特小姐听到。”","“Exupere,” he said to his son, “you must try to carry out intelligently a little manoeuvre which I shall explain to you, but you are not to ask the meaning of it; and if you guess the meaning I command you to toss it into that Styx which every lawyer and every man who expects to have a hand in the government of his country is bound to keep within him for the secrets of others.After you have paid your respects and compliments to Madame and Mademoiselle Mignon, to Monsieur and Madame Dumay, and to Monsieur Gobenheim if he is at the Chalet, and as soon as quiet is restored, Monsieur Dumay will take you aside; you are then to look attentively at Mademoiselle Modeste (yes, I am willing to allow it) during the whole time he is speaking to you.My worthy friend will ask you to go out and take a walk; at the end of an hour, that is, about nine o’clock, you are to come back in a great hurry; try to puff as if you were out of breath, and whisper in Monsieur Dumay’s ear, quite low, but so that Mademoiselle Modeste is sure to overhear you, these words: ‘The young man has come.’”"
"埃克絮佩第二天早晨便要动身去巴黎攻读法律了。正因他即将出行，拉图奈尔才决定把他的儿子推荐给他的朋友迪迈，让他在一桩重大的阴谋里充当帮凶。从他给出的上述指示，已经能看出这是个阴谋了。","Exupere was to start the next morning for Paris to begin the study of law.This impending departure had induced Latournelle to propose him to his friend Dumay as an accomplice in the important conspiracy which these directions indicate."
"“是有人怀疑莫黛斯特小姐有情人吗？”比查胆怯地问拉图奈尔夫人。","“Is Mademoiselle Modeste suspected of having a lover?” asked Butscha in a timid voice of Madame Latournelle."
"“嘘，比查。”她回答道，然后又挽起了丈夫的胳膊。","“Hush, Butscha,” she replied, taking her husband’s arm."
"拉图奈尔夫人是最高法院一名书记员的女儿。她觉得自己出身高贵，足以和国会世家的人分庭抗礼。这种自命不凡正好解释了为什么这个脸上长了不少斑的女人总要极力摆出上法庭般的严肃姿态。那些法庭判决都是由她父亲亲笔记录的呢。她吸鼻烟，腰板挺得像枪的通条一样笔直，一副故作深沉的姿态，活像一具被电击后暂时复活的木乃伊。她嗓音刺耳，极力想用高贵的语调说话，却总是失败，掩盖不了自己总体上缺乏教养的事实。然而，我们只要看看她头上缀满花朵的帽子、前额弯曲的假刘海以及她所挑选的裙袍，就会发现她的社会价值不容置疑。要是没有拉图奈尔夫人这样的人，商人要怎么处理掉这些商品呢？这位可敬的女士，的确是位信仰虔诚、心肠慈悲之人。她的愚蠢滑稽本可以不被人发觉的，然而大自然往往喜欢自娱自乐，造出这种可笑的人物不说，还要赋予她鼓乐队指挥般的身段。这样，她那粗野本性中的滑稽之处就显而易见了。　她从未离开过勒阿弗尔，她认为勒阿弗尔完美无缺，她自称是个百分之百的诺曼人，她崇敬她的父亲，并热爱自己的丈夫。","Madame Latournelle, the daughter of a clerk of the supreme court, feels that her birth authorizes her to claim issue from a parliamentary family.This conviction explains why the lady, who is somewhat blotched as to complexion, endeavors to assume in her own person the majesty of a court whose decrees are recorded in her father’s pothooks.She takes snuff, holds herself as stiff as a ramrod, poses for a person of consideration, and resembles nothing so much as a mummy brought momentarily to life by galvanism.She tries to give high-bred tones to her sharp voice, and succeeds no better in doing that than in hiding her general lack of breeding.Her social usefulness seems, however, incontestable when we glance at the flower-bedecked cap she wears, at the false front frizzling around her forehead, at the gowns of her choice; for how could shopkeepers dispose of those products if there were no Madame Latournelle?All these absurdities of the worthy woman, who is truly pious and charitable, might have passed unnoticed, if nature, amusing herself as she often does by turning out these ludicrous creations, had not endowed her with the height of a drum-major, and thus held up to view the comicalities of her provincial nature.She has never been out of Havre; she believes in the infallibility of Havre; she proclaims herself Norman to the very tips of her fingers; she venerates her father, and adores her husband."
"小拉图奈尔娶她的时候，她已经三十三岁，过了适婚年龄。他真有胆量，不但娶了她，还让她给自己生了个儿子。由于她那六万法郎的嫁妆他通过其他方式也可以获得，所以大家普遍认为他的弥天大勇是为了避免弥诺陶洛斯的入侵，因为如果他轻率地拿自己的命运做赌注，娶一位年轻貌美的女子为妻，那仅凭他的个人条件是很难抵挡住弥诺陶洛斯的。然而，事实是公证人看到了阿涅丝小姐（拉图奈尔夫人的闺名）真正的美好品质，而且他明白，一个女人的美貌对于她的丈夫来说是转瞬即逝的。说到她年轻的儿子——本书一个无足轻重的角色，在他接受洗礼时，他那位在法院当书记员的外祖父给他取了这个诺曼味十足的名字“埃克絮佩”。能在三十五岁零七个月的年纪生下这个孩子，拉图奈尔夫人至今还觉得十分惊奇，而且如果有必要的话，她现在还能给他喂奶——这说法有点夸张了，但仅这一点就足以充分表明她那热烈的母爱。“看我那儿子，长得多帅气啊！”每当她和她年轻的好友莫黛斯特去做礼拜，她那仪表堂堂的埃克絮佩走在她们前面时，她就会这样说道。“他长得像你。”莫黛斯特·米尼翁答道。她说这话的语气跟她说“天气真糟糕！”一类的话时没太大差别，完全是出于礼貌。由于近三年来，拉图奈尔夫人经常陪伴在少女莫黛斯特左右，而公证人和他的朋友迪迈正在为莫黛斯特设计一个“婚姻生理学”中称作“捕鼠器”的圈套，所以拉图奈尔夫人就成了一名重要的帮凶。","Little Latournelle was bold enough to marry this lady after she had attained the anti-matrimonial age of thirty-three, and what is more, he had a son by her.As he could have got the sixty thousand francs of her “dot” in several other ways, the public assigned his uncommon intrepidity to a desire to escape an invasion of the Minotaur, against whom his personal qualifications would have insufficiently protected him had he rashly dared his fate by bringing home a young and pretty wife.The fact was, however, that the notary recognized the really fine qualities of Mademoiselle Agnes (she was called Agnes) and reflected to himself that a woman’s beauty is soon past and gone to a husband.As to the insignificant youth on whom the clerk of the court bestowed in baptism his Norman name of “Exupere,” Madame Latournelle is still so surprised at becoming his mother, at the age of thirty-five years and seven months, that she would still provide him, if it were necessary, with her breast and her milk,—an hyperbole which alone can fully express her impassioned maternity.“How handsome he is, that son of mine!” she says to her little friend Modeste, as they walk to church, with the beautiful Exupere in front of them.“He is like you,” Modeste Mignon answers, very much as she might have said, “What horrid weather!”This silhouette of Madame Latournelle is quite important as an accessory, inasmuch as for three years she has been the chaperone of the young girl against whom the notary and his friend Dumay are now plotting to set up what we have called, in the “Physiologie du Mariage,” a “mouse-trap.”"
"至于拉图奈尔，大家可以想象一个值得尊敬的小个子男子，既诚实正直，又十分狡猾——任何一个陌生人见了他，都会因为他那奇怪的相貌而把他当成坏人，而勒阿弗尔人早已对他的外表习以为常了。据说他视力不好，眼睛总是红肿，为了保护眼睛，这位可敬的人物不得不戴上绿色的护目镜。他那毛发稀疏的眉弓围着褐色的玳瑁镜框，看上去像是两对直径不同的同心圆。每一侧的同心圆都是大圈套小圈，两圈之间隔着一条凹陷的皮肤，如果你从未在一张人脸上见过这样的景象，那你很难想象看到它你会有多诧异，何况这张脸还是面色苍白、两颊干瘪，下巴尖得活像画家们按照猫脸画的魔鬼靡菲斯特。巴比拉·拉图奈尔的脸就是这样，看上去既像猫，又像魔鬼。在那吓人的绿色眼镜上面是光秃秃的脑壳，白色的假发在前额分开一条歪歪扭扭的发线，四面散开，看上去好像会动似的。这一切使他脸上的表情更显狡猾。这位杰出的诺曼人一袭黑衣，迈动双腿的样子就像一只被钉在大头针上的甲虫。如果一个人了解他正直可信的品格，又看到他这副样貌，一定想知道为什么他的外表与内心如此不符，虽然答案是找不到的。","As for Latournelle, imagine a worthy little fellow as sly as the purest honor and uprightness would allow him to be,—a man whom any stranger would take for a rascal at sight of his queer physiognomy, to which, however, the inhabitants of Havre were well accustomed.His eyesight, said to be weak, obliged the worthy man to wear green goggles for the protection of his eyes, which were constantly inflamed.The arch of each eyebrow, defined by a thin down of hair, surrounded the tortoise-shell rim of the glasses and made a couple of circles as it were, slightly apart.If you have never observed on the human face the effect produced by these circumferences placed one within the other, and separated by a hollow space or line, you can hardly imagine how perplexing such a face will be to you, especially if pale, hollow-cheeked, and terminating in a pointed chin like that of Mephistopheles,—a type which painters give to cats.This double resemblance was observable on the face of Babylas Latournelle.Above the atrocious green spectacles rose a bald crown, all the more crafty in expression because a wig, seemingly endowed with motion, let the white hairs show on all sides of it as it meandered crookedly across the forehead.An observer taking note of this excellent Norman, clothed in black and mounted on his two legs like a beetle on a couple of pins, and knowing him to be one of the most trustworthy of men, would have sought, without finding it, for the reason of such physical misrepresentation."
"让·比查是个被遗弃的私生子，由法院书记员和他女儿抚养成人。现在，他全凭刻苦工作，成了公证人的首席文书，在他老板那里吃住，每个月还能领到九百法郎的薪水。他几乎是个侏儒，没有一点年轻人的样子，却视莫黛斯特为偶像，为她赔上自己的性命也在所不惜。他那厚厚的眼皮底下，眼珠像火炮的点火孔一样凹陷下去，脑袋大得不合身体比例，显得头重脚轻，长着一头卷发，满脸麻子。这个可怜的小伙子，从七岁开始就生活在别人怜悯的目光下。难道这些还不足以解释他的整个性格吗？他沉默寡言，信仰虔诚，做事中规中矩。他独自游荡在爱情地图上被称为“无望爱情”的国度里，那是一片寸草不生而又令人赞叹的“欲望草原”。莫黛斯特把这位奇丑无比的文书叫做她的“黑侏儒”。听到这个绰号，他便去读瓦尔特·司各特的小说。后来有一天，他对莫黛斯特说道：“您能接受您神秘的侏儒献上的一朵玫瑰吗？它能为您消灾解难。”莫黛斯特狠狠地瞪了他一眼，这马上把她这位崇拜者打回了他那污秽的小泥屋里。少女们总会对那些无法取悦他们的男子投以这种目光。比查的自我观念很卑微，而且跟他老板的夫人一样，他也从未离开过勒阿弗尔。","Jean Butscha, a natural son abandoned by his parents and taken care of by the clerk of the court and his daughter, and now, through sheer hard work, head-clerk to the notary, fed and lodged by his master, who gave him a salary of nine hundred francs, almost a dwarf, and with no semblance of youth,—Jean Butscha made Modeste his idol, and would willingly have given his life for hers.The poor fellow, whose eyes were hollowed beneath their heavy lids like the touch-holes of a cannon, whose head overweighted his body, with its shock of crisp hair, and whose face was pock-marked, had lived under pitying eyes from the time he was seven years of age.Is not that enough to explain his whole being?Silent, self-contained, pious, exemplary in conduct, he went his way over that vast tract of country named on the map of the heart Love-without-Hope, the sublime and arid steppes of Desire.Modeste had christened this grotesque little being her “Black Dwarf.”The nickname sent him to the pages of Walter Scott’s novel, and he one day said to Modeste: “Will you accept a rose against the evil day from your mysterious dwarf?”Modeste instantly sent the soul of her adorer to its humble mud-cabin with a terrible glance, such as young girls bestow on the men who cannot please them.Butscha’s conception of himself was lowly, and, like the wife of his master, he had never been out of Havre."
"也许，为了那些从没去过勒阿弗尔的读者起见，这里有必要解释一下拉图奈尔一家以及首席文书现在要去往哪里。安古维尔之于勒阿弗尔，类似于蒙马特尔之于巴黎——都是高高的山丘，城市就坐落在它们脚下。而不同之处在于，巴黎是被塞纳河环绕的，而勒阿弗尔的山丘和城市则是四面环海，还被封闭的防御工事所包围。简而言之，在勒阿弗尔，河流入海处、港口、码头所呈现的景象，与巴黎那五万幢房屋的景象是完全不同的。在蒙马特尔脚下，石板瓦屋顶组成的汪洋就像是静止的蓝色波涛,而在安古维尔，大海就像是被风吹动的石板瓦屋顶。这座山丘，或者说这座绵延的山脉，沿着塞纳河从鲁昂一直延伸到大海，山谷与河流之间形成了窄窄的狭长谷地，这里的城市、山涧、溪谷和草地都是风景如画。自一八一六年勒阿弗尔开始繁荣以来，这些美景便成了安古维尔一带的宝贵财富。从那时开始，这个小镇就变成了类似洛特依、达弗赖城和蒙莫朗西的地方，简言之，就是勒阿弗尔商人的城郊住宅区。在这里，商人们在山坡的梯田上建起了一幢幢房子，他们呼吸着海洋的气息，那气息中还弥漫着他们的豪华花园散发的芳香。由于勒阿弗尔的人口不断增加，加上那些无法更改的防御工事和不断扩大的码头，使得投机商们原来的房子都成了建筑垃圾，房屋紧挨在一起，很少有空地，甚至往往连院子都没有。而在安古维尔，这些大胆的投机商们可以抛下账房的重担，忘掉市区房子的压抑氛围，释放压力。结果就是，这些人在勒阿弗尔时身心疲惫，在安古维尔则轻松快活。社会发展的法则使得格拉维尔郊区的建筑像雨后春笋般多了起来。如今，格拉维尔城比勒阿弗尔还要大，像一条巨蟒盘在山脚下。","Perhaps it will be well, for the sake of those who have never seen that city, to say a few words as to the present destination of the Latournelle family,—the head clerk being included in the latter term.Ingouville is to Havre what Montmartre is to Paris,—a high hill at the foot of which the city lies; with this difference, that the hill and the city are surrounded by the sea and the Seine, that Havre is helplessly circumscribed by enclosing fortifications, and, in short, that the mouth of the river, the harbor, and the docks present a very different aspect from the fifty thousand houses of Paris.At the foot of Montmartre an ocean of slate roofs lies in motionless blue billows; at Ingouville the sea is like the same roofs stirred by the wind.This eminence, or line of hills, which coasts the Seine from Rouen to the seashore, leaving a margin of valley land more or less narrow between itself and the river, and containing in its cities, its ravines, its vales, its meadows, veritable treasures of the picturesque, became of enormous value in and about Ingouville, after the year 1816, the period at which the prosperity of Havre began.This township has become since that time the Auteuil, the Ville-d’Avray, the Montmorency, in short, the suburban residence of the merchants of Havre.Here they build their houses on terraces around its amphitheatre of hills, and breathe the sea air laden with the fragrance of their splendid gardens.Here these bold speculators cast off the burden of their counting-rooms and the atmosphere of their city houses, which are built closely together without open spaces, often without court-yards,—a vice of construction with the increasing population of Havre, the inflexible line of the fortifications, and the enlargement of the docks has forced upon them.The result is, weariness of heart in Havre, cheerfulness and joy at Ingouville.The law of social development has forced up the suburb of Graville like a mushroom.It is today more extensive than Havre itself, which lies at the foot of its slopes like a serpent."
"安古维尔山的山顶上只有一条街，而且（正如所有这种情况下那样），面朝塞纳河的房屋同马路另一边那些视线受阻的房屋相比，有着相当的优势。从这一边踮起脚尖，就能看见对面房屋的屋顶。然而，这里也像其他地方一样，存在着一些地役权的限制。一些建在山顶的房屋有着更好的地理位置，或者说拥有合法的俯瞰风景的权利，这迫使它们对面的邻居只能将房屋保持在某一规定的高度以内。此外，嶙峋的山石被开凿成山路，山路沿着斜坡走势而建，以使这里更适宜居住，一些房屋也能通过山石的缺口俯瞰城市、河流或者大海的远景。这座小山没有一个真正的顶峰，而是形成了一座唐突而陡峭的悬崖。沿着山顶走到街道的尽头，便能看到峡谷，那里坐落着几个村落（其中一个叫圣阿德雷斯，还有另外两三个也叫“圣”什么的），还有几条随着海潮静静流淌的小溪。安古维尔山这一侧荒芜的峭壁，同另一侧盖满了能够眺望塞纳河山谷的别墅的丘陵，形成了强烈的对比。是这面的风太大，草木不能生长？还是开发这里需要巨额投资，所以商人们都退缩了呢？不论什么原因，那些乘坐轮船来到勒阿弗尔的游客，都会对安古维尔西侧贫瘠的海岸和错综复杂的峡谷感到惊讶。打个比方，就像是看到一个衣衫褴褛的乞丐站在一个满身香气、衣冠楚楚的阔佬旁边一样。","At the crest of the hill Ingouville has but one street, and (as in all such situations) the houses which overlook the river have an immense advantage over those on the other side of the road, whose view they obstruct, and which present the effect of standing on tip-toe to look over the opposing roofs.However, there exist here, as elsewhere, certain servitudes.Some houses standing at the summit have a finer position or possess legal rights of view which compel their opposite neighbors to keep their buildings down to a required height.Moreover, the openings cut in the capricious rock by roads which follow its declensions and make the amphitheatre habitable, give vistas through which some estates can see the city, or the river, or the sea.Instead of rising to an actual peak, the hill ends abruptly in a cliff.At the end of the street which follows the line of the summit, ravines appear in which a few villages are clustered (Sainte–Adresse and two or three other Saint-somethings) together with several creeks which murmur and flow with the tides of the sea.These half-deserted slopes of Ingouville form a striking contrast to the terraces of fine villas which overlook the valley of the Seine.Is the wind on this side too strong for vegetation?Do the merchants shrink from the cost of terracing it?However this may be, the traveller approaching Havre on a steamer is surprised to find a barren coast and tangled gorges to the west of Ingouville, like a beggar in rags beside a perfumed and sumptuously apparelled rich man."
"一八二九年，最后一批靠海的房子建起来了，其中有一座——今天它很可能已经是安古维尔的中心了——被称作“木屋”。现在，说不定人们还是这样叫它。起初，那只是一间看门人住的小屋，前面是一座修剪整齐的小花园。木屋后面的别墅是一座带有庭院、花园、鸟房、温室以及草坪的宅邸。别墅主人想让这栋小木屋与自己的豪宅风格更加一致，便按照农舍式小别墅的样子对其进行了重建。他用一道矮墙将这座小农舍同别墅的草坪分开，又沿墙种上树篱将墙遮住。农舍边围绕着花床，算是别墅的露台区。这座农舍式小别墅（尽管主人费劲心思，人们还是叫它“木屋”）的后面便是果园和菜园。木屋不养奶牛，也不产乳制品。它与道路之间隔着一道木栅栏，栅栏的木桩被茂盛的树篱盖住了。道路另一边与之相对的房屋也遵从地役权的规定，建造了相似高度的栅栏和围篱，这样从木屋别墅便能将勒阿弗尔的景色一览无遗。","In 1829 one of the last houses looking toward the sea, and which in all probability stands about the centre of the Ingouville today, was called, and perhaps is still called, “the Chalet.”Originally it was a porter’s lodge with a trim little garden in front of it.The owner of the villa to which it belonged,—a mansion with park, gardens, aviaries, hot-houses, and lawns—took a fancy to put the little dwelling more in keeping with the splendor of his own abode, and he reconstructed it on the model of an ornamental cottage.He divided this cottage from his own lawn, which was bordered and set with flower-beds and formed the terrace of his villa, by a low wall along which he planted a concealing hedge.Behind the cottage (called, in spite of all his efforts to prevent it, the Chalet) were the orchards and kitchen gardens of the villa.The Chalet, without cows or dairy, is separated from the roadway by a wooden fence whose palings are hidden under a luxuriant hedge.On the other side of the road the opposite house, subject to a legal privilege, has a similar hedge and paling, so as to leave an unobstructed view of Havre to the Chalet."
"这所小木屋令别墅的现任主人维尔坎先生头疼不已，原因说来话长。这座别墅里每个奢华的角落仿佛都高喊着：“看我们的万贯家财！”别墅的最初建造者把庭院延伸到远处的原野，用他的话说，就是为了不让园丁们在他眼皮底下工作。因此，木屋建成以后，也只有别墅主人的朋友才能来住。别墅的第二位主人米尼翁先生非常喜欢他的账房总管迪迈先生，而接下来的故事也将证明这种喜欢是相互的。于是，他让迪迈先生住到这间小木屋来。迪迈是一个严格按法律程序办事的人，他坚持要和东家签一个为期十二年、每年租金三百法郎的租约，米尼翁先生很乐意地签了，并说道：","This little dwelling was the torment of the present proprietor of the villa, Monsieur Vilquin; and here is the why and the wherefore.The original creator of the villa, whose sumptuous details cry aloud, “Behold our millions!” extended his park far into the country for the purpose, as he averred, of getting his gardeners out of his pockets; and so, when the Chalet was finished, none but a friend could be allowed to inhabit it.Monsieur Mignon, the next owner of the property, was very much attached to his cashier, Dumay, and the following history will prove that the attachment was mutual; to him therefore he offered the little dwelling.Dumay, a stickler for legal methods, insisted on signing a lease for three hundred francs for twelve years, and Monsieur Mignon willingly agreed, remarking,—"
"“亲爱的迪迈，记住，从现在开始，你要同我在这里住上十二年。”","“My dear Dumay, remember, you have now bound yourself to live with me for twelve years.”"
"后来，由于发生了一些变故——我们不久就会讲到这些变故——这位曾是勒阿弗尔首富的米尼翁先生将房产卖给了他在生意场上的一个对手，维尔坎。能够得到远近闻名的米尼翁别墅，维尔坎自然是高兴得不得了，兴头之下，忘记了和迪迈解除租约。迪迈没有急于阻止这笔交易，维尔坎让他签什么合约他就签什么合约，可买卖成交之后，他却死守着那份租约不放。而且，他一直留在维尔坎眼皮底下，深入维尔坎家庭生活的内部，观察维尔坎，刺激维尔坎，总之，对维尔坎一家来说，他就像是一只牛虻。每天早晨，维尔坎从窗前向外眺望，都会看到外面那座耗资六万法郎、在阳光下像块红宝石般闪闪发光的小木屋——整座别墅的精华所在。每当这时，一股怒火便会从他心头升起。将木屋比作红宝石真是太贴切了。建筑师建造这座农舍式小别墅时，用的是最鲜亮耀眼的红砖，砖缝则填涂了白色的水泥。窗框漆成鲜绿色，木家具则刷成接近于黄色的浅棕色。屋檐向外伸出几英尺远。底楼上方有一条漂亮的回廊，栏杆是透雕细工的，在房子正面的中间形成一个镶着玻璃的凉台。一楼有一间漂亮的客厅和一间餐厅，两厅由一个木制的楼梯平台隔开，楼梯的设计和装饰朴素而典雅。餐厅后面是厨房，客厅后面原来是间书房，现在改成了迪迈先生和迪迈夫人的卧室。建筑师在二楼建了两间大卧室，每间都配有梳妆室，凉台可以当作客厅。三层的房顶像是两张抵在一起的扑克牌，这一层有两间仆人卧室，每一间的屋顶都是复折式的，开着圆形的天窗，倒也敞亮。","In consequence of certain events which will presently be related, the estates of Monsieur Mignon, formerly the richest merchant in Havre, were sold to Vilquin, one of his business competitors.In his joy at getting possession of the celebrated villa Mignon, the latter forgot to demand the cancelling of the lease.Dumay, anxious not to hinder the sale, would have signed anything Vilquin required, but the sale once made, he held to his lease like a vengeance.And there he remained, in Vilquin’s pocket as it were; at the heart of Vilquin’s family life, observing Vilquin, irritating Vilquin,—in short, the gadfly of all the Vilquins.Every morning, when he looked out of his window, Vilquin felt a violent shock of annoyance as his eye lighted on the little gem of a building, the Chalet, which had cost sixty thousand francs and sparkled like a ruby in the sun.That comparison is very nearly exact.The architect has constructed the cottage of brilliant red brick pointed with white.The window-frames are painted of a lively green, the woodwork is brown verging on yellow.The roof overhangs by several feet.A pretty gallery, with open-worked balustrade, surmounts the lower floor and projects at the centre of the facade into a veranda with glass sides.The ground-floor has a charming salon and a dining-room, separated from each other by the landing of a staircase built of wood, designed and decorated with elegant simplicity.The kitchen is behind the dining-room, and the corresponding room back of the salon, formerly a study, is now the bedroom of Monsieur and Madame Dumay.On the upper floor the architect has managed to get two large bedrooms, each with a dressing-room, to which the veranda serves as a salon; and above this floor, under the eaves, which are tipped together like a couple of cards, are two servants’ rooms with mansard roofs, each lighted by a circular window and tolerably spacious."
"维尔坎十分小气，他在果园和菜园的一侧修起了一堵高墙，而这一恶意行为的结果就是，租约中归木屋所属的那一小块地看上去就像一个巴黎花园了。木屋外围建筑的油漆与木屋保持一致，背靠着邻家的墙。","Vilquin has been petty enough to build a high wall on the side toward the orchard and kitchen garden; and in consequence of this piece of spite, the few square feet which the lease secured to the Chalet resembled a Parisian garden.The out-buildings, painted in keeping with the cottage, stood with their backs to the wall of the adjoining property."
"这间漂亮的小屋，其内部风格也与其外观十分协调。客厅的整个地板都是实木的，油漆的风格让人联想到精美的中国漆器。黑底金边的木板上镶着的颜色各异的鸟儿、鲜绿异常的叶子和奇特的东方图样，绚丽夺目、闪闪发光。整个餐厅都铺着北方木材，用的是透雕细工的工艺，像是漂亮的俄罗斯小木屋。楼梯与楼梯平台之间形成的小小前厅被漆成了古橡木色，呈现出哥特式的装饰风格。卧室里挂着印花纱帐，风格简单，却价格不菲，散发着独特的魅力。账房总管和他夫人现在住的书房，墙和天花板上上下下都镶着装饰木板，就像一艘轮船的船舱。别墅前任主人留下的奢华装饰让维尔坎感到十分恼火。他本想让他的女儿女婿住到这座农舍式别墅来。迪迈对他的这种想法心知肚明，可他有着布列塔尼人典型的固执脾气，就是不肯搬走。","The interior of this charming dwelling harmonized with its exterior.The salon, floored entirely with iron-wood, was painted in a style that suggested the beauties of Chinese lacquer.On black panels edged with gold, birds of every color, foliage of impossible greens, and fantastic oriental designs glowed and shimmered.The dining-room was entirely sheathed in Northern woods carved and cut in open-work like the beautiful Russian chalets.The little antechamber formed by the landing and the well of the staircase was painted in old oak to represent Gothic ornament.The bedrooms, hung with chintz, were charming in their costly simplicity.The study, where the cashier and his wife now slept, was panelled from top to bottom, on the walls and ceiling, like the cabin of a steamboat.These luxuries of his predecessor excited Vilquin’s wrath.He would fain have lodged his daughter and her husband in the cottage.This desire, well known to Dumay, will presently serve to illustrate the Breton obstinacy of the latter."
"木屋的进门处是一扇小小的格子状铁门，铁栏上的金属刺要比栅栏和树篱高出几英寸。小花园几乎和那片迷人的草坪一样开阔，里面正开着各种各样的花，如玫瑰花、精选品种的大丽花，以及其他许多稀有的温室品种，因为（这也是让维尔坎痛苦不已的一个原因）那座小而华贵的温室，创意奇特的温室，代表着高贵和气派的温室，正是属木屋管辖的。温室在木屋和维尔坎的别墅之间，把二者分隔开来，或者你也可以说是把二者连在一起。迪迈精心照料着这座温室，以此缓解做生意的疲劳，那温室里的异国珍宝也是莫黛斯特的一大乐趣。维尔坎别墅的弹子房像一条长廊，曾经通过一座巨大的鸟舍与这间温室相连。但是，维尔坎修起高墙后，自己便看不到果园了，自那之后，迪迈便将这扇门用砖堵死了。“以墙还墙！”他说。","The entrance to the Chalet is by a little trellised iron door, the uprights of which, ending in lance-heads, show for a few inches above the fence and its hedge.The little garden, about as wide as the more pretentious lawn, was just now filled with flowers, roses, and dahlias of the choicest kind, and many rare products of the hot-houses, for (another Vilquinard grievance) the elegant little hot-house, a very whim of a hot-house, a hot-house representing dignity and style, belonged to the Chalet, and separated, or if you prefer, united it to the villa Vilquin.Dumay consoled himself for the toils of business in taking care of this hot-house, whose exotic treasures were one of Modeste’s joys.The billiard-room of the villa Vilquin, a species of gallery, formerly communicated through an immense aviary with this hot-house.But after the building of the wall which deprived him of a view into the orchards, Dumay bricked up the door of communication.“Wall for wall!” he said."
"一八二七年，维尔坎提出如果迪迈愿意放弃租约，他将给迪迈每年六千法郎的薪水，外加一万法郎作为赔偿。尽管当时这位账房总管只能从他原东家的文员哥本海姆那里得到三千法郎，但他还是拒绝了维尔坎的提议。迪迈本是一位布列塔尼人，由于命运的安排，移居到了诺曼底。因此，大家可以想象一下，对于身价达到三百万的诺曼人维尔坎而言，木屋的房客令他何等痛恨！让这样一个富有的人感到金钱的无能，这位账房总管可真是犯了亵渎万贯金钱罪啊！在这件事上，维尔坎表现得孤注一掷，这已成了勒阿弗尔人的笑柄。最近他又提出把自己的一栋漂亮房子给迪迈，但又被拒绝了。勒阿弗尔人开始为这位先生的固执感到不安，许多人用这样一句话来解释：“迪迈是布列塔尼人。”对于这位账房总管来说，他认为米尼翁夫人和小姐住到其他地方去肯定会觉得不适。他所崇拜的两位偶像现在正住在与她们相称的神庙里，这座奢华的小农舍式别墅能给她们一个家，让这些被罢黜的贵族保持外在的尊严，而许多曾经风光的人是得不到这种尊严的。","In 1827 Vilquin offered Dumay a salary of six thousand francs, and ten thousand more as indemnity, if he would give up the lease.The cashier refused; though he had but three thousand francs from Gobenheim, a former clerk of his master.Dumay was a Breton transplanted by fate into Normandy.Imagine therefore the hatred conceived for the tenants of the Chalet by the Norman Vilquin, a man worth three millions!What criminal leze-million on the part of a cashier, to hold up to the eyes of such a man the impotence of his wealth!Vilquin, whose desperation in the matter made him the talk of Havre, had just proposed to give Dumay a pretty house of his own, and had again been refused.Havre itself began to grow uneasy at the man’s obstinacy, and a good many persons explained it by the phrase, “Dumay is a Breton.”As for the cashier, he thought Madame and Mademoiselle Mignon would be ill-lodged elsewhere.His two idols now inhabited a temple worthy of them; the sumptuous little cottage gave them a home, where these dethroned royalties could keep the semblance of majesty about them,—a species of dignity usually denied to those who have seen better days."
"在继续这个故事之前，先了解一下莫黛斯特·米尼翁住在哪里，平常都和哪些人来往，读者们应该不会感到后悔的。因为在莫黛斯特·米尼翁这个年龄段，周围的人和事物对她未来人生的影响毫不亚于她个人性格造成的影响。事实上，周围的环境往往会给一个人的性格带来不可磨灭的烙印。","Perhaps as the story goes on, the reader will not regret having learned in advance a few particulars as to the home and the habitual companions of Modeste Mignon, for, at her age, people and things have as much influence upon the future life as a person’s own character,—indeed, character often receives ineffaceable impressions from its surroundings."
"第二章 一幅生活图","Chapter II A Portrait from Life "
"从拉图奈尔一家人走进木屋的样子，一个陌生人很容易就可以猜到他们每晚都会去那里。","From the manner with which the Latournelles entered the Chalet a stranger would readily have guessed that they came there every evening."
"“啊，你已经到了。”公证人看到那位年轻的银行家哥本海姆时这样说道。哥本海姆是巴黎大银行董事长哥本海姆-凯勒的亲戚。","“Ah, you are here already,” said the notary, perceiving the young banker Gobenheim, a connection of Gobenheim-Keller, the head of the great banking house in Paris."
"这个年轻人脸色灰白，金发黑眼，坚定的目光中带有一种说不出的魅力，言行举止都很冷静。他一身黑衣，瘦得像个肺病患者，但看体格还算有活力。他时常去拜访前东家一家和账房总管，但与其说是出于感情，还不如说是打着自己的小算盘。他们在这里玩惠斯特纸牌，两苏一个筹码。这种场合不需要穿礼服，除了几杯糖水，他也不吃其他茶点，因此也不用拘泥任何礼节。这种对米尼翁一家表面上的忠心让人们觉得哥本海姆很有良心，同时，他也就不必到勒阿弗尔去进行社交，花那些冤枉钱，影响他的生活支出平衡。这位金钱的信徒每天十点半睡觉，五点钟起床。此外，他深信拉图奈尔和比查会守口如瓶，这样他就可以跟他们讨论棘手的生意问题，得到公证人的免费建议，并一窥街头巷尾那些传言的真相。这个冷漠无情的恋金癖（比查语），本性就像化学中被称为“吸附剂”的那类物质。凯勒银行起初是派他到米尼翁家去学习海上贸易的经验。自从米尼翁家破产后，木屋里任何人都没让他做过一点点小事情，任何事情都没有，因为大家都知道他的回答会是什么。这个年轻小伙子仔细端详莫黛斯特时，就像是在看一幅廉价的平版印刷品。","This young man with a livid face—a blonde of the type with black eyes, whose immovable glance has an indescribable fascination, sober in speech as in conduct, dressed in black, lean as a consumptive, but nevertheless vigorously framed—visited the family of his former master and the house of his cashier less from affection than from self-interest.Here they played whist at two sous a point; a dress-coat was not required; he accepted no refreshment except “eau sucree,” and consequently had no civilities to return.This apparent devotion to the Mignon family allowed it to be supposed that Gobenheim had a heart; it also released him from the necessity of going into the society of Havre and incurring useless expenses, thus upsetting the orderly economy of his domestic life.This disciple of the golden calf went to bed at half-past ten o’clock and got up at five in the morning.Moreover, being perfectly sure of Latournelle’s and Butscha’s discretion, he could talk over difficult business matters, obtain the advice of the notary gratis, and get an inkling of the real truth of the gossip of the street.This stolid gold-glutton (the epithet is Butscha’s) belonged by nature to the class of substances which chemistry terms absorbents.Ever since the catastrophe of the house of Mignon, where the Kellers had placed him to learn the principles of maritime commerce, no one at the Chalet had ever asked him to do the smallest thing, no matter what; his reply was too well known.The young fellow looked at Modeste precisely as he would have looked at a cheap lithograph."
"“他就像‘贸易’这部庞大机器中的一个活塞。”可怜的比查这样说道。比查有时候会胆怯地冒出几句这样的话，让人觉得他还挺聪明。","“He’s one of the pistons of the big engine called ‘Commerce,’” said poor Butscha, whose clever mind made itself felt occasionally by such little sayings timidly jerked out."
"拉图奈尔一家四口以最恭敬的方式向一位身穿黑丝绒长裙的老妇人鞠躬致敬。老妇人坐在扶手椅里，并未起身，因为她患有白内障，双眼已经被黄色的薄膜遮住了。她便是米尼翁夫人，可以用一句话来形容她。作为一名家庭主妇，她那令人敬畏的面容会立刻引起你的注意，她一生无可指摘，勇于反抗命运的打击，然而，她却偏偏成了无数尼俄柏人当中的一员，被命运选作放矢之的。她头上的金色假发有着细致的小卷，戴得熨熨贴贴，衬着她冰冷、白皙的脸庞，就像画家哈尔斯或米尔威特笔下的德国市长夫人。她的穿着极其整洁，丝绒靴、蕾丝衣领、平整的披肩，这一切都证明了莫黛斯特对她母亲无微不至的关爱。","The four Latournelles bowed with the most respectful deference to an old lady dressed in black velvet, who did not rise from the armchair in which she was seated, for the reason that both eyes were covered with the yellow film produced by cataract.Madame Mignon may be sketched in one sentence.Her august countenance of the mother of a family attracted instant notice as that of one whose irreproachable life defies the assaults of destiny, which nevertheless makes her the target of its arrows and a member of the unnumbered tribe of Niobes.Her blonde wig, carefully curled and well arranged upon her head, became the cold white face which resembled that of some burgomaster’s wife painted by Hals or Mirevelt.The extreme neatness of her dress, the velvet boots, the lace collar, the shawl evenly folded and put on, all bore testimony to the solicitous care which Modeste bestowed upon her mother."
"正如公证人所料，华丽的客厅安静了下来，莫黛斯特坐在她母亲旁边，为她绣一块方巾。这位少女立即成为了众人关注的中心。来访的客人用俗套的寒暄来掩饰他们的好奇，就算是一个毫不相干的人，看到这场景也能发觉这一家人正在为莫黛斯特设计某个陷阱。但哥本海姆还不如一个毫不相干的人，他什么都没有察觉到，只是点亮了牌桌的蜡烛。迪迈的行为让比查、拉图奈尔一家，尤其是迪迈夫人，感到形势严峻，迪迈夫人知道，她的丈夫会像一只疯狗那样不顾一切地朝莫黛斯特的情人开枪。","When silence was, as the notary had predicted, restored in the pretty salon, Modeste, sitting beside her mother, for whom she was embroidering a kerchief, became for an instant the centre of observation.This curiosity, barely veiled by the commonplace salutations and inquiries of the visitors, would have revealed even to an indifferent person the existence of the domestic plot to which Modeste was expected to fall a victim; but Gobenheim, more than indifferent, noticed nothing, and proceeded to light the candles on the card-table.The behavior of Dumay made the whole scene terrifying to Butscha, to the Latournelles, and above all to Madame Dumay, who knew her husband to be capable of firing a pistol at Modeste’s lover as coolly as though he were a mad dog."
"那天晚餐过后，账房总管带着两只名贵的比利牛斯猎犬出去散步。他怀疑那两条狗会出卖他，于是便将它们交给了一个曾经做过米尼翁先生佃户的农夫看管。回来后，就在拉图奈尔一家到达之前，他从床头取出几支手枪，背着莫黛斯特将它们放到壁炉架上。这位年轻姑娘竟然一点也没注意到这些奇怪的准备工作。","After dinner that day the cashier had gone to walk followed by two magnificent Pyrenees hounds, whom he suspected of betraying him, and therefore left in charge of a farmer, a former tenant of Monsieur Mignon.On his return, just before the arrival of the Latournelles, he had taken his pistols from his bed’s head and placed them on the chimney-piece, concealing this action from Modeste.The young girl took no notice whatever of these preparations, singular as they were."
"这位布列塔尼人曾做过近卫军中尉，别看他长得矮小粗壮、满脸麻子，说话时声调很低，像是在自言自语一样，他的表情却十分坚毅，一脸冷酷，以至于他的一生中，就连在部队里，也没有人敢跟他开玩笑。他那小小的碧蓝色眼睛就像两块钢片，透着一丝沉着。他的办事方式、面部表情、言行举止，无不与他那简短的名字“迪迈”相称。他体格健壮，这一点无人不知，使得他不会面临任何被攻击的危险。他可以一拳打死一个人，在包岑他就有过这样的战绩。当时是他落在同伴的后面，手无寸铁地面对一个撒克逊人。现在，他那通常坚定而又温和的表情已经升华到一种悲剧美的崇高境界。他的脸和嘴唇都很苍白，说明他正在以布列塔尼人的毅力来控制着内心的烦乱。他的额头微微冒汗，眉毛都弄湿了，大家都注意到了，并认为他是在冒冷汗。这些迹象可能会导致一出足以上刑事法庭的悲剧，公证人对此再清楚不过了。事实上，这位账房总管是在为莫黛斯特·米尼翁下一盘棋，其中牵扯到在他看来比社会法则重要得多的荣誉感和忠诚感，而他现在的行为起因于一份契约，如果发生了什么不幸，恐怕也只有由上帝来裁决了。大多数戏剧之所以成为戏剧，正是由于我们自身对事物的看法。那些我们看来戏剧化的事情，其实只是因为我们根据个人的性格，用自己的心灵将它们转化成了悲剧或喜剧。","Though short, thick-set, pockmarked, and speaking always in a low voice as if listening to himself, this Breton, a former lieutenant in the Guard, showed the evidence of such resolution, such sang-froid on his face that throughout life, even in the army, no one had ever ventured to trifle with him.His little eyes, of a calm blue, were like bits of steel.His ways, the look on his face, his speech, his carriage, were all in keeping with the short name of Dumay.His physical strength, well-known to every one, put him above all danger of attack.He was able to kill a man with a blow of his fist, and had performed that feat at Bautzen, where he found himself, unarmed, face to face with a Saxon at the rear of his company.At the present moment the usually firm yet gentle expression of the man’s face had risen to a sort of tragic sublimity; his lips were pale as the rest of his face, indicating a tumult within him mastered by his Breton will; a slight sweat, which every one noticed and guessed to be cold, moistened his brow.The notary knew but too well that these signs might result in a drama before the criminal courts.In fact the cashier was playing a part in connection with Modeste Mignon, which involved to his mind sentiments of honor and loyalty of far greater importance than mere social laws; and his present conduct proceeded from one of those compacts which, in case disaster came of it, could be judged only in a higher court than one of earth.The majority of dramas lie really in the ideas which we make to ourselves about things.Events which seem to us dramatic are nothing more than subjects which our souls convert into tragedy or comedy according to the bent of our characters."
"拉图奈尔夫人和迪迈夫人被安排监视莫黛斯特，她们举止很不自然，声音也有些颤抖。但那位被怀疑的少女却并没有察觉到这些，而是一心专注于她的刺绣。莫黛斯特把每一针都绣得恰到好处，这恐怕是普通的刺绣女工望尘莫及的。从她的表情可以看出，她正沉浸在绣花瓣的喜悦当中。矮子比查坐在他的女主人和哥本海姆中间，克制着自己的情绪，想着用什么办法靠近莫黛斯特，并在她耳边提醒一下她。","Madame Latournelle and Madame Dumay, who were appointed to watch Modeste, had a certain assumed stiffness of demeanor and a quiver in their voices, which the suspected party did not notice, so absorbed was she in her embroidery.Modeste laid each thread of cotton with a precision that would have made an ordinary workwoman desperate.Her face expressed the pleasure she took in the smooth petals of the flower she was working.The dwarf, seated between his mistress and Gobenheim, restrained his emotion, trying to find means to approach Modeste and whisper a word of warning in her ear."
"拉图奈尔夫人使出她那虔诚教徒的鬼心眼儿，坐在米尼翁夫人前面的位子上，这样就将莫黛斯特与其他人隔离开了。米尼翁夫人双眼失明，因此总是保持沉默。她的脸色比平时更加苍白，这很清楚地说明她意识到了她女儿将要经受的考验。或许，她会在最后时刻起来反抗这一计谋，因为这对她来说似乎是有必要的。于是，她保持着沉默，心里却在流泪。埃克絮佩是整个计谋的扳机，但他对这个自己将在其中扮演一个角色的剧本全然不知。由于性格的原因，哥本海姆同莫黛斯特一样，仍保持着一种漠不关心的状态。一些人毫无察觉，另一些人却心跳加速、紧张兮兮，对于一个了解内情的旁观者来说，这种对比看上去真的很有意思。如今，浪漫主义作家总是会安排这样的效果，而且他们也确实有权利这样做，因为自古以来大自然编故事的本领总比他们高明。因此，你将会看到，这里的自然，即社会自然（它是大自然中的一种第二自然），将事实编造得比小说更有意思，以此来自娱自乐。正如山泉的蜿蜒曲折是画家无法描摹的，而泉水打磨石块的鬼斧神工，也令建筑师和雕刻家们叹为观止。","By taking a position in front of Madame Mignon, Madame Latournelle, with the diabolical intelligence of conscientious duty, had isolated Modeste.Madame Mignon, whose blindness always made her silent, was even paler than usual, showing plainly that she was aware of the test to which her daughter was about to be subjected.Perhaps at the last moment she revolted from the stratagem, necessary as it might seem to her.Hence her silence; she was weeping inwardly.Exupere, the spring of the trap, was wholly ignorant of the piece in which he was to play a part.Gobenheim, by reason of his character, remained in a state of indifference equal to that displayed by Modeste.To a spectator who understood the situation, this contrast between the ignorance of some and the palpitating interest of others would have seemed quite poetic.Nowadays romance-writers arrange such effects; and it is quite within their province to do so, for nature in all ages takes the liberty to be stronger than they.In this instance, as you will see, nature, social nature, which is a second nature within nature, amused herself by making truth more interesting than fiction; just as mountain torrents describe curves which are beyond the skill of painters to convey, and accomplish giant deeds in displacing or smoothing stones which are the wonder of architects and sculptors."
"已经是晚上八点了。在那个季节，黄昏的最后一丝余晖仍未散去，天空万里无云，柔和的空气抚摸着大地，鲜花散发出芳香，归家的行人走在碎石路上，脚下沙沙作响，波光鳞鳞的大海像一面镜子。尽管窗户是敞开的，但风很小，牌桌上的烛火安静地燃烧着。这间客厅，这个夜晚，这套住宅——这一切就像一只美丽的画框，烘托着画中少女的美貌！此刻，人们都全神贯注地审视着这位少女，就像画家审视皮蒂画院的名画之一《玛德莱娜·多尼》一样。莫黛斯特就像诗人卡图卢斯笔下含苞待放的鲜花，这样的一位少女竟需要人们如此百般防范吗？","It was eight o’clock.At that season twilight was still shedding its last gleams; there was not a cloud in the sky; the balmy air caressed the earth, the flowers gave forth their fragrance, the steps of pedestrians turning homeward sounded along the gravelly road, the sea shone like a mirror, and there was so little wind that the wax candles upon the card-tables sent up a steady flame, although the windows were wide open.This salon, this evening, this dwelling—what a frame for the portrait of the young girl whom these persons were now studying with the profound attention of a painter in presence of the Margharita Doni, one of the glories of the Pitti palace.Modeste,—blossom enclosed, like that of Catullus,—was she worth all these precautions?"
"看完了鸟笼，下面来看看这只小鸟吧！莫黛斯特年方二十，窈窕纤弱，就像英国素描家们为《美女图》所创作的美女。她同她母亲年轻时一样，是优雅迷人的化身，但这种魅力大多数法国人无法理解，只是把它称作“多愁善感”。而对德国女人而言，这种魅力则是内心诗意在外表的体现——愚蠢的女子表现为矫揉造作，活泼聪明的女子则表现为非凡的迷人姿态。莫黛斯特那淡淡的金发十分引人注目，属于那种被称为“金发仙子”（这种说法大概是为了纪念夏娃）的女人；她那光滑的肌肤就像是贴在皮肉上的绢纸，会因冷峻的眼神而瑟瑟发抖，而在充满爱意的目光下，又会像受到阳光照射般舒展开来——真让人看着就想用手摸一下。她的头发柔软轻盈，打着许多波浪卷。头发下的额头就像是用圆规画出来的，线条完美无瑕，透出一股镇定和安详，又带着一丝思考的灵动：世上怎么可能有另外一个如此洁白无瑕、精致平滑的额头呢？它就像一颗珍珠，光彩夺目。她的双眸蓝中透灰，如孩童的眼睛那样清澈，还保留着儿童时代的全部淘气与单纯，与她那像是在一张中国脸谱上用毛笔轻轻勾勒出的眉弓浑然一体。她的眼周、眼角以及鬓角，都泛着蓝色的、珍珠般的光辉，这是只有皮肤娇嫩的人才有的特质，更加体现出她心灵的纯真。她长着一张鹅蛋脸，如同拉斐尔笔下的圣母玛利亚，那冷静、纯洁的面颊格外引人注目，柔嫩得像一朵孟加拉玫瑰。透明的眼睑上方，长长的睫毛投射出一抹半明半暗的阴影。她刺着绣，象牙白的脖子低垂着，轮廓精致纤美，让人想起列奥纳多·达芬奇爱用的那种若隐若现的线条。她的脸上有几颗雀斑，犹如十八世纪妇女用来装扮的美人斑，这证明了莫黛斯特确实是大地的女儿，而不是意大利天使学派幻想出来的尤物。她的双唇精致而饱满，带有一丝嘲弄的味道，颇具吸引力。她的腰柔软灵活，却并不柔弱，因此生小孩时不会有任何困难，不像有些少女为了追求美丽，被紧身衣勒出致命伤。她那优雅的身段浑然天成，裙撑、麻纱和饰带更凸显出她那蛇一般的曲线，使她看上去像一株风中摇曳的小白杨那样优美。","You have seen the cage; behold the bird!Just twenty years of age, slender and delicate as the sirens which English designers invent for their “Books of Beauty,” Modeste was, like her mother before her, the captivating embodiment of a grace too little understood in France, where we choose to call it sentimentality, but which among German women is the poetry of the heart coming to the surface of the being and spending itself—in affectations if the owner is silly, in divine charms of manner if she is “spirituelle” and intelligent.Remarkable for her pale golden hair, Modeste belonged to the type of woman called, perhaps in memory of Eve, the celestial blonde; whose satiny skin is like a silk paper applied to the flesh, shuddering at the winter of a cold look, expanding in the sunshine of a loving glance,—teaching the hand to be jealous of the eye.Beneath her hair, which was soft and feathery and worn in many curls, the brow, which might have been traced by a compass so pure was its modelling, shone forth discreet, calm to placidity, and yet luminous with thought: when and where could another be found so transparently clear or more exquisitely smooth?It seemed, like a pearl, to have its orient.The eyes, of a blue verging on gray and limpid as the eyes of a child, had all the mischief, all the innocence of childhood, and they harmonized well with the arch of the eyebrows, faintly indicated by lines like those made with a brush on Chinese faces.This candor of the soul was still further evidenced around the eyes, in their corners, and about the temples, by pearly tints threaded with blue, the special privilege of these delicate complexions.The face, whose oval Raphael so often gave to his Madonnas, was remarkable for the sober and virginal tone of the cheeks, soft as a Bengal rose, upon which the long lashes of the diaphanous eyelids cast shadows that were mingled with light.The throat, bending as she worked, too delicate perhaps, and of milky whiteness, recalled those vanishing lines that Leonardo loved.A few little blemishes here and there, like the patches of the eighteenth century, proved that Modeste was indeed a child of earth, and not a creation dreamed of in Italy by the angelic school.Her lips, delicate yet full, were slightly mocking and somewhat sensuous; the waist, which was supple and yet not fragile, had no terrors for maternity, like those of girls who seek beauty by the fatal pressure of a corset.Steel and dimity and lacings defined but did not create the serpentine lines of the elegant figure, graceful as that of a young poplar swaying in the wind."
"她穿着一件珠灰色的连衣裙，镶着深红色的饰边，腰身很长，很好地勾勒出她上半身的轮廓，内穿一件紧身胸衣，掩盖住还有点消瘦的肩膀，人们只能看到脖子与肩膀相接处最上方的曲线。再来看看这位少女的脸庞吧：希腊式的鼻子精致细腻，鼻孔呈玫红色，轮廓分明的面颊透出几分自信、笃定，整张脸散发出一种优雅、聪慧的气息。近乎神秘的额头所呈现的诗意美有时候会被嘴角边嬉笑的表情所掩盖。深邃而又变幻莫测的双眼时而透出一股直率，时而又充满了后天训练与教育带来的嘲讽精神。从这张脸庞的方方面面，一位善于观察的人会感觉到，这位少女敏锐机灵的耳朵会被任何一个声音唤醒，她的鼻子随时可以捕捉到理想之花的芳香，她命中注定要在黎明时的诗情画意与白天的劳作之间、理想与现实之间，以及精神与生活之间，进行艰难的抉择。莫黛斯特是一位纯洁的少女，求知欲强，深知命理，贞洁自爱——与其说她是拉斐尔的圣母玛利亚，还不如说她是西班牙的圣女。","A pearl-gray dress with crimson trimmings, made with a long waist, modestly outlined the bust and covered the shoulders, still rather thin, with a chemisette which left nothing to view but the first curves of the throat where it joined the shoulders.From the aspect of the young girl’s face, at once ethereal and intelligent, where the delicacy of a Greek nose with its rosy nostrils and firm modelling marked something positive and defined; where the poetry enthroned upon an almost mystic brow seemed belied at times by the pleasure-loving expression of the mouth; where candor claimed the depths profound and varied of the eye, and disputed them with a spirit of irony that was trained and educated,—from all these signs an observer would have felt that this young girl, with the keen, alert ear that waked at every sound, with a nostril open to catch the fragrance of the celestial flower of the Ideal, was destined to be the battle-ground of a struggle between the poesies of the dawn and the labors of the day; between fancy and reality, the spirit and the life.Modeste was a pure young girl, inquisitive after knowledge, understanding her destiny, and filled with chastity,—the Virgin of Spain rather than the Madonna of Raphael."
"她听到迪迈对埃克絮佩说“到这来，小伙子”，便抬起头来。她看到他们在客厅的一角，还以为他们是在谈巴黎的某桩差事。接着，她看看周围的朋友们，似乎很奇怪他们为什么这么安静。她自然地问道：“你们怎么不打牌呢？”并看了一眼被高大壮硕的拉图奈尔夫人称作“祭坛”的牌桌。","She raised her head when she heard Dumay say to Exupere, “Come here, young man.”Seeing them together in the corner of the salon she supposed they were talking of some commission in Paris.Then she looked at the friends who surrounded her, as if surprised by their silence, and exclaimed in her natural manner, “Why are you not playing?”—with a glance at the green table which the imposing Madame Latournelle called the “altar.”"
"“对对，来打牌。”迪迈先生说道。他刚刚打发走了埃克絮佩。","“Yes, let us play,” said Dumay, having sent off Exupere."
"“比查，你坐那儿。”拉图奈尔夫人说道。这样她就用这张大桌子将首席文书同米尼翁夫人及其女儿分了开来。","“Sit there, Butscha,” said Madame Latournelle, separating the head-clerk from the group around Madame Mignon and her daughter by the whole width of the table."
"“你，到这儿来。”迪迈先生对他妻子说，让她坐在自己旁边。","“And you, come over here,” said Dumay to his wife, making her sit close by him."
"迪迈夫人是一位个子小小的美国人，大约三十六岁。她悄悄地抹了抹眼睛，她十分喜欢莫黛斯特，生怕出什么事。","Madame Dumay, a little American about thirty-six years of age, wiped her eyes furtively; she adored Modeste, and feared a catastrophe."
"“你们今天晚上不怎么活跃啊。”莫黛斯特说道。","“You are not very lively this evening,” remarked Modeste."
"“我们不是在玩牌么。”哥本海姆一面说道，一面排好手里的牌。","“We are playing,” said Gobenheim, sorting his cards."
"不管此时的情形看上去多么有趣，如果我再解释一下迪迈先生在莫黛斯特问题上所处的立场，事情就会变得更加有趣了。如果我简短的解释显得有些干巴巴的，那还请读者谅解，因为我们希望尽快带过这些铺垫工作，并有必要将统筹整个故事的主要情况联系起来。","No matter how interesting this situation may appear, it can be made still more so by explaining Dumay’s position towards Modeste.If the brevity of this explanation makes it seem rather dry, the reader must pardon its dryness in view of our desire to get through with these preliminaries as speedily as possible, and the necessity of relating the main circumstances which govern all dramas."

"让·弗朗索瓦·贝尔纳·迪迈，出生于瓦讷，一七九九年加入远征意大利的大军。迪迈的父亲曾是当地革命法庭的主席，任职时十分嚣张，于是，当这位狡诈的律师父亲于热月九日被送上断头台之后，那里再也没有迪迈的容身之处了。他母亲因这一突发的灾祸抑郁而终。母亲死后，让便变卖了所有家产，跑到了意大利，当时他二十二岁。也正是在那时，我们的军队开始向敌人屈服了。路上，他在瓦尔省遇到了一个年轻人，也跟他出于同样的原因，想去追求战功，感觉战场还不如自己的家乡普罗旺斯危险。这个人叫夏尔·米尼翁，巴黎有一条街是以他的家族命名的，还有一所公馆是由米尼翁红衣主教建造的。他是这个古老家族的最后子嗣，他父亲很是精明，善于算计，企图将他在孔塔的拉巴斯蒂伯爵封地从大革命的魔爪下拯救出来。于是这位拉巴斯蒂公爵也跟当时所有胆小怕事的人一样，给自己冠上了“公民”的称号，成了“米尼翁公民”。他明白，与其让别人砍自己的头，还不如去砍别人的头来得有益。这位假冒的恐怖分子在热月九日之后便消失了，接着便被列入了流亡者的名单。拉巴斯蒂封地被拍卖了，古老城堡的塔楼和堡垒被夷为平地。这位米尼翁公民很快就在奥尔良被发现，并同他的妻子和孩子们一起被处死。只有夏尔幸免于难，他当时被父亲派到上阿尔卑斯省，为家人找一个避难之所。","Jean Francois Bernard Dumay, born at Vannes, started as a soldier for the army of Italy in 1799.His father, president of the revolutionary tribunal of that town, had displayed so much energy in his office that the place had become too hot to hold the son when the parent, a pettifogging lawyer, perished on the scaffold after the ninth Thermidor.On the death of his mother, who died of the grief this catastrophe occasioned, Jean sold all that he possessed and rushed to Italy at the age of twenty-two, at the very moment when our armies were beginning to yield.On the way he met a young man in the department of Var, who for reasons analogous to his own was in search of glory, believing a battle-field less perilous than his own Provence.Charles Mignon, the last scion of an ancient family, which gave its name to a street in Paris and to a mansion built by Cardinal Mignon, had a shrewd and calculating father, whose one idea was to save his feudal estate of La Bastie in the Comtat from the claws of the Revolution.Like all timid folk of that day, the Comte de La Bastie, now citizen Mignon, found it more wholesome to cut off other people’s heads than to let his own be cut off.The sham terrorist disappeared after the 9th Thermidor, and was then inscribed on the list of emigres.The estate of La Bastie was sold; the towers and bastions of the old castle were pulled down, and citizen Mignon was soon after discovered at Orleans and put to death with his wife and all his children except Charles, whom he had sent to find a refuge for the family in the Upper Alps."
"听到这个消息，夏尔惊恐万分，便躲在热内弗尔山谷中避风头。他在那里一直呆到一七九九年，靠临行前父亲给他的几个路易勉强度日。到夏尔二十三岁的时候，他除了自己的堂堂外表之外，已经一无所有。他有着典型的南方人美貌，当这种美达到极致时，可以说是无与伦比（罗马皇帝亚德里安最宠爱的安提弩斯就是这一类型）。夏尔决定拿他普罗旺斯人的胆量赌一把，和许多其他年轻人一样，他把这看作是一种天意，要去战场上大干一番。在去军队驻地尼斯的路上，他碰到了布列塔尼人迪迈。或许由于性格互补，两人成了亲密的伙伴，他们从路边的激流中同饮一杯水，分享一块饼干，马伦戈战役停战后，两个人又都成了中士。","Horrorstruck at the news, Charles waited for better times in a valley of Mont Genevra; and there he remained till 1799, subsisting on a few louis which his father had put into his hand at starting.Finally, when twenty-three years of age, and without other fortune than his fine presence and that southern beauty which, when it reaches perfection, may be called sublime (of which Antinous, the favorite of Adrian, is the type), Charles resolved to wager his Provencal audacity—taking it, like many another youth, for a vocation—on the red cloth of war.On his way to the base of the army at Nice he met the Breton.The pair became intimate, partly from the contrasts in their characters; they drank from the same cup at the wayside torrents, broke the same biscuit, and were both made sergeants at the peace which followed the battle of Marengo."
"后来战事又开始了，夏尔·米尼翁被调入了骑兵团，并与他的战友失去了联系。到一八一二年，这位米尼翁·德拉巴斯蒂家族的末代子孙已经成了荣誉军团的军官和骑兵团的少校。后来，他被俄国人俘虏，并同其他许多人一样，被送往西伯利亚。途中，他与另外一个同是俘虏的可怜的陆军中尉结伴，他发现那人正是自己的老朋友让·迪迈。迪迈同其他上百万戴着羊毛肩章的普通士兵一样，没被授勋，他很勇敢，却默默无闻，穿着简朴，过得并不开心。拿破仑正是在这样一幅由无数士兵组成的油画上描绘了他的帝国蓝图。在西伯利亚的时候，中校为了打发时间，便教这个布列塔尼人写字和算术。对赛沃拉教长而言，对迪迈进行早期教育简直是浪费时间。在过去一起行军的日子里，夏尔发现这位老战友有着少有的好心肠，自己可以跟他吐露辛酸，也可以与之分享快乐。","When the war recommenced, Charles Mignon was promoted into the cavalry and lost sight of his comrade.In 1812 the last of the Mignon de La Bastie was an officer of the Legion of honor and major of a regiment of cavalry.Taken prisoner by the Russians he was sent, like so many others, to Siberia.He made the journey in company with another prisoner, a poor lieutenant, in whom he recognized his old friend Jean Dumay, brave, neglected, undecorated, unhappy, like a million of other woollen epaulets, rank and file—that canvas of men on which Napoleon painted the picture of the Empire.While in Siberia, the lieutenant-colonel, to kill time, taught writing and arithmetic to the Breton, whose early education had seemed a useless waste of time to Pere Scevola.Charles found in the old comrade of his marching days one of those rare hearts into which a man can pour his griefs while telling his joys."
"这位普罗旺斯年轻人的人生际遇与所有英俊的单身汉相同。一八零四年，在美因河畔的法兰克福，一位银行家的独生女贝蒂娜·瓦朗罗德爱上了他。他满怀热情地跟她结了婚，因为她家境富裕、姿色过人，而他当时只是一个没有任何希望的中尉、小兵痞，前途十分渺茫。老瓦朗罗德是一个失势的德国男爵（德国的银行总由一个男爵掌管），当他得知这位英俊的陆军中尉便是米尼翁·德拉巴斯蒂家族的唯一后裔时，感到很高兴，同意了金发少女贝蒂娜的婚事。有一位画家（当时在法兰克福的确有这么一位）曾依照贝蒂娜美丽的脸庞画了一幅理想的德国美女头像。瓦朗罗德在法国国库里存了足够的钱，这样她的女儿每年可以拿到三万法郎。他还提前将这些钱赠与他未来的外孙们，给他们取名为拉巴斯蒂－瓦朗罗德伯爵。由于当时钱不值钱，因此这笔“嫁妆”只给他的钱匣子造成了一个小小的缺口。但当时的法兰西帝国效仿许多其他债务国，实行了一项政策，很少能把利息付清，因此夏尔很担心这笔存款。他对帝国雄鹰的信念远不如他的岳父那么大。信念，或者说是仰慕，这种现象只是一种短暂的信仰，当你同你的崇拜对象近距离接触时，这种崇拜往往就很难维持了。旅行者迷信机器，机修工却对机器不以为然。即使军队的军官们不是拿破仑这台机车的燃料，至少也是它的烧炉工人。","The young Provencal had met the fate which attends all handsome bachelors.In 1804, at Frankfort on the Main, he was adored by Bettina Wallenrod, only daughter of a banker, and he married her with all the more enthusiasm because she was rich and a noted beauty, while he was only a lieutenant with no prospects but the extremely problematical future of a soldier of fortune of that day.Old Wallenrod, a decayed German baron (there is always a baron in a German bank) delighted to know that the handsome lieutenant was the sole representative of the Mignon de La Bastie, approved the love of the blonde Bettina, whose beauty an artist (at that time there really was one in Frankfort) had lately painted as an ideal head of Germany.Wallenrod invested enough money in the French funds to give his daughter thirty thousand francs a year, and settled it on his anticipated grandsons, naming them counts of La Bastie–Wallenrod.This “dot” made only a small hole in his cash-box, the value of money being then very low.But the Empire, pursuing a policy often attempted by other debtors, rarely paid its dividends; and Charles was rather alarmed at this investment, having less faith than his father-inlaw in the imperial eagle.The phenomenon of belief, or of admiration which is ephemeral belief, is not so easily maintained when in close quarters with the idol.The mechanic distrusts the machine which the traveller admires; and the officers of the army might be called the stokers of the Napoleonic engine,—if, indeed, they were not its fuel."
"然而，瓦朗罗德-图斯塔尔-巴登斯梯德男爵答应在必要的时候帮助这个家庭。夏尔和贝蒂娜·瓦朗罗都深爱着对方，并且程度相当，这样说可能有点儿理想化，但当一个普罗旺斯人充满激情的时候，他的一切感觉和情感都是真实而自然的。再说，他怎能不爱上这位仿佛从杜勒画中走下来的、生来便具有天使般的气质并拥有法兰克福财富的金发美女呢？这对夫妇生了四个孩子，到他向这位布列塔尼人吐露辛酸的时候，只剩下两个女儿还活着。迪迈尽管没看到这两个小家伙，但仅仅通过夏尔对她们深深的怜爱，他便爱上了她们。对女儿的怜爱使夏尔充满柔情，恨不得把每个小孩都当成自己的孩子。夏尔的大女儿叫贝蒂娜·卡罗琳，生于一八零五年，另外一个女儿叫玛丽·莫黛斯特，生于一八零八年。一八一四年，停战合约签订后，这位可怜的中校在中尉的陪同下，奉命徒步穿过俄罗斯和普鲁士。他很久都没有自己两个心爱的宝贝的消息了。对这一对朋友而言，军衔的差异已经不算什么了。他们到达法兰克福的时候，拿破仑正好在戛纳登陆。","However, the Baron Wallenrod-Tustall-Bartenstild promised to come if necessary to the help of the household.Charles loved Bettina Wallenrod as much as she loved him, and that is saying a good deal; but when a Provencal is moved to enthusiasm all his feelings and attachments are genuine and natural.And how could he fail to adore that blonde beauty, escaping, as it were, from the canvas of Durer, gifted with an angelic nature and endowed with Frankfort wealth?The pair had four children, of whom only two daughters survived at the time when he poured his griefs into the Breton’s heart.Dumay loved these little ones without having seen them, solely through the sympathy so well described by Charlet, which makes a soldier the father of every child.The eldest, named Bettina Caroline, was born in 1805; the other, Marie Modeste, in 1808.The unfortunate lieutenant-colonel, long without tidings of these cherished darlings, was sent, at the peace of 1814, across Russia and Prussia on foot, accompanied by the lieutenant.No difference of epaulets could count between the two friends, who reached Frankfort just as Napoleon was disembarking at Cannes."
"夏尔在法兰克福找到了他的妻子，她正在为父亲服丧。她父亲一直都很宠爱她，总是尽量逗她开心，甚至连临终前也是这样。老瓦朗罗德没能幸免于帝国的灾难。七十岁的时候，他开始投机棉花，对拿破仑的天才深信不疑，殊不知就是天才也往往对变幻无常的世事束手无策。这位老人买了许多捆棉花，其数量几乎与在拿破仑宏大的法兰西战役中牺牲的士兵数相当。“我洗（死）也要洗（死）在棉发（花）堆里。”这位父亲对女儿说道。他是一位高老头式的父亲，极力抚慰女儿的悲伤，也让自己好过些。“我对鞋（谁）都没有任何的亏欠——”他咽了气，临死前还尽量用他女儿所喜爱的语言跟她说话。","Charles found his wife in Frankfort, in mourning for her father, who had always idolized her and tried to keep a smile upon her lips, even by his dying bed.Old Wallenrod was unable to survive the disasters of the Empire.At seventy years of age he speculated in cottons, relying on the genius of Napoleon without comprehending that genius is quite as often beyond as at the bottom of current events.The old man had purchased nearly as many bales of cotton as the Emperor had lost men during his magnificent campaign in France.“I tie in goddon,” said the father to the daughter, a father of the Goriot type, striving to quiet a grief which distressed him.“I owe no mann anything—” and he died, still trying to speak to his daughter in the language that she loved."
"幸好，夏尔·米尼翁把妻子和女儿从这场大灾难中救了出来。之后他回到了巴黎，皇帝任命他为禁卫军胸甲骑兵中校，并担任荣誉军团的指挥官。中校还梦想着打完第一次胜仗后被提升为伯爵和将军。唉！这个希望随着血流成河的滑铁卢战役灰飞烟灭了。中校受了点轻伤，撤退到卢瓦尔河畔，并在军队解散之前离开了图尔。","Thankful to have saved his wife and daughters from the general wreck, Charles Mignon returned to Paris, where the Emperor made him lieutenant-colonel in the cuirassiers of the Guard and commander of the Legion of honor.The colonel dreamed of being count and general after the first victory.Alas! that hope was quenched in the blood of Waterloo.The colonel, slightly wounded, retired to the Loire, and left Tours before the disbandment of the army."
"一八一六年春天，夏尔以将近四十万法郎的价钱卖掉了她妻子在国库里的财产，准备离开自己的国家，去美洲碰碰运气，因为当时国内已经开始对拿破仑的旧部大加迫害。滑铁卢之战后，在撤退的混乱中，他把迪迈带在自己坐骑后面，救了他一命。夏尔在迪迈的陪伴下去了勒阿弗尔。迪迈跟中校意见一致，也有着同样的焦虑。这个可怜的家伙像崇拜偶像一样地爱着夏尔的两个小女儿，并像一只西班牙猎犬一样跟着夏尔。夏尔自信这个生性驯良、惯于服从、为人正直且对自己很有感情的中尉完全可以成为一个既有用又忠诚的仆人，于是他提议让迪迈以平民身份跟着他。迪迈十分高兴能被这个家庭所收留，他决心依附这个家庭，就像槲寄生依附于橡树那样。","In the spring of 1816 Charles sold his wife’s property out of the funds to the amount of nearly four hundred thousand francs, intending to seek his fortune in America, and abandon his own country where persecution was beginning to lay a heavy hand on the soldiers of Napoleon.He went to Havre accompanied by Dumay, whose life he had saved at Waterloo by taking him on the crupper of his saddle in the hurly-burly of the retreat.Dumay shared the opinions and the anxieties of his colonel; the poor fellow idolized the two little girls and followed Charles like a spaniel.The latter, confidence that the habit of obedience, the discipline of subordination, and the honesty and affection of the lieutenant would make him a useful as well as a faithful retainer, proposed to take him with him in a civil capacity.Dumay was only too happy to be adopted into the family, to which he resolved to cling like the mistletoe to an oak."
"中校一边待机登船，一边挑选船只，并思考那些船只所要去的各种港口能给他带来的机会。在这个过程中，他听到许多人说和平将给勒阿弗尔带来光明的前景。他听着商人们的谈话，预料到了发财的路子。于是他分秒必争，开始着手让自己成为地产主、银行家和运输商。他在镇上买了地和房子，并派了一艘商船到纽约，上面装着从里昂以折扣价买来的丝绸。他派迪迈做他的经纪人，随船出行。迪迈回来的时候发了两笔财，一是卖了丝绸，二是以低价格买回了棉花。这时，他发现他的中校一家已经搬进了王政街最漂亮的房子，以普罗旺斯人惊人的活力和聪明才智，学习着银行业务。","While waiting for an opportunity to embark, at the same time making choice of a ship and reflecting on the chances offered by the various ports for which they sailed, the colonel heard much talk about the brilliant future which the peace seemed to promise to Havre.As he listened to these conversations among the merchants, he foresaw the means of fortune, and without loss of time he set about making himself the owner of landed property, a banker, and a shipping-merchant.He bought land and houses in the town, and despatched a vessel to New York freighted with silks purchased in Lyons at reduced prices.He sent Dumay on the ship as his agent; and when the latter returned, after making a double profit by the sale of the silks and the purchase of cottons at a low valuation, he found the colonel installed with his family in the handsomest house in the rue Royale, and studying the principles of banking with the prodigious activity and intelligence of a native of Provence."
"迪迈做的这两笔生意对米尼翁家族来说是一笔很大的财富。中校买下了安古维尔的别墅，还奖给他的经纪人一所位于王政街的简朴小屋。这位可怜而卖力的仆人从纽约带回来的，除了棉花之外，还有一位娇小美丽的妻子，她似乎是被他那法国人的天性所吸引了。格吕梅尔小姐大约有四千美元的财产（合两万法郎）。迪迈将这些钱投资到中校那里，现在，他已经是中校的至交了。他用很短的时间学会了替东家管账，用他的话来说，做这一行的可以称得上是商业中的军士长。这位天真纯朴的士兵，二十年来都没有受到过幸运之神的眷顾。而此时，他拥有了一所小房子，东家还慷慨地为他添置了家具，每年能得到一千二百法郎的分红以及三千六百法郎的薪水，他觉得自己是世界上最幸福的人了。迪迈中尉做梦都没想过会有这么好的境遇，而更让他感到满足的是，他觉得自己凭好运经营起来的产业已经成了勒阿弗尔最富有的商行的财富枢纽。","This double operation of Dumay’s was worth a fortune to the house of Mignon.The colonel purchased the villa at Ingouville and rewarded his agent with the gift of a modest little house in the rue Royale.The poor toiler had brought back from New York, together with his cottons, a pretty little wife, attracted it would seem by his French nature.Miss Grummer was worth about four thousand dollars (twenty thousand francs), which sum Dumay placed with his colonel, to whom he now became an alter ego.In a short time he learned to keep his patron’s books, a science which, to use his own expression, pertains to the sergeant-majors of commerce.The simple-hearted soldier, whom fortune had forgotten for twenty years, thought himself the happiest man in the world as the owner of the little house (which his master’s liberality had furnished), with twelve hundred francs a year from money in the funds, and a salary of three thousand six hundred.Never in his dreams had Lieutenant Dumay hoped for a situation so good as this; but greater still was the satisfaction he derived from the knowledge that his lucky enterprise had been the pivot of good fortune to the richest commercial house in Havre."
"迪迈夫人是一位漂亮小巧的美国女人，不幸的是，她生了好几胎，每次都是孩子一生下来就死掉了。她的最后一次分娩更是死里逃生，彻底打碎了她再生孩子的希望。因此，她对两位米尼翁小姐十分喜爱，迪迈也很爱她们。说不定即使他们自己有孩子，迪迈还是会更喜欢这两位小姐。迪迈太太的父母都是勤俭节约的农民。现在自己和全家能有两千四百法郎作为家庭开支，她便已十分满足。于是，迪迈每年又将两千几百法郎投到米尼翁商行中去。每年年终清算账务的时候，中校都会为了感谢这位账务总管的勤劳工作而多给他一些奖金。这样，他的存款就越来越多了。到一八二四年，这位账务总管的存款已经达到了五万八千法郎。那时，再没有人称夏尔·米尼翁为德拉巴斯蒂伯爵了。米尼翁做了一件让其账务总管最为开心的事，就是让他住到木屋来。这个故事开始的时候，米尼翁夫人和她的女儿正隐居在那里。","Madame Dumay, a rather pretty little American, had the misfortune to lose all her children at their birth; and her last confinement was so disastrous as to deprive her of the hope of any other.She therefore attached herself to the two little Mignons, whom Dumay himself loved, or would have loved, even better than his own children had they lived.Madame Dumay, whose parents were farmers accustomed to a life of economy, was quite satisfied to receive only two thousand four hundred francs of her own and her household expenses; so that every year Dumay laid by two thousand and some extra hundreds with the house of Mignon.When the yearly accounts were made up the colonel always added something to this little store by way of acknowledging the cashier’s services, until in 1824 the latter had a credit of fifty-eight thousand francs.In was then that Charles Mignon, Comte de La Bastie, a title he never used, crowned his cashier with the final happiness of residing at the Chalet, where at the time when this story begins Madame Mignon and her daughter were living in obscurity."
"米尼翁夫人这种糟糕的身体状况在某种程度上是出于一场灾祸，也正是这场灾祸，让她的丈夫离开了她。三年来，这位温和的德国女人被悲伤彻底击垮了。那种悲伤侵蚀着她的内心，就像一只蠕虫在啃食一只好果子的果心一样。她悲伤的原因显而易见，总结起来也很容易。两个孩子还在襁褓中就夭折了，这给她留下了刻骨铭心的痛。丈夫被流放到西伯利亚，对这个女人来说，每天都是生不如死。瓦朗罗德家族破产，父亲与世长辞，留下空空的金库，当时自己的丈夫又前途未卜，这对贝蒂娜来说又是一个沉重的打击。夏尔的归来让她兴奋不已，过度的欢乐差点摧毁了这朵脆弱的德国花朵。随着帝国的再度崩溃，他们准备流浪国外，这让她觉得像寒热复发一样难受。然而，最后终于有了长达十年的家族兴旺，她的家成了勒阿弗尔最豪华舒适的富商住宅，举办了各种晚宴、舞会、游乐会。米尼翁别墅金碧辉煌，丈夫受人尊敬、声望极高，又对她一往情深，用无与伦比的爱来报答她忠贞的爱——这一切，又让这个女人获得了重生。就在她的疑虑和担忧终于消除之后，在她展望历经风雨后幸福的晚年时，一场深埋在家族内部的灾难爆发了，带来一连串新的考验。我们下面很快就要讲到。","The deplorable state of Madame Mignon’s health was caused in part by the catastrophe to which the absence of her husband was due.Grief had taken three years to break down the docile German woman; but it was a grief that gnawed at her heart like a worm at the core of a sound fruit.It is easy to reckon up its obvious causes.Two children, dying in infancy, had a double grave in a soul that could never forget.The exile of her husband to Siberia was to such a woman a daily death.The failure of the rich house of Wallenrod, and the death of her father, leaving his coffers empty, was to Bettina, then uncertain about the fate of her husband, a terrible blow.The joy of Charles’s return came near killing the tender German flower.After that the second fall of the Empire and the proposed expatriation acted on her feelings like a renewed attack of the same fever.At last, however, after ten years of continual prosperity, the comforts of her house, which was the finest in Havre, the dinners, balls, and fetes of a prosperous merchant, the splendors of the villa Mignon, the unbounded respect and consideration enjoyed by her husband, his absolute affection, giving her an unrivalled love in return for her single-minded love for him,—all these things brought the woman back to life.At the moment when her doubts and fears at last left her, when she could look forward to the bright evening of her stormy life, a hidden catastrophe, buried in the heart of the family, and of which we shall presently make mention, came as the precursor of renewed trials."
"一八二六年一月，就在勒阿弗尔全体人民一致推选夏尔·米尼翁为他们的国会议员代表的那天，从纽约、巴黎和伦敦寄来了三封信，像一记重锤毁灭了他辉煌的水晶宫。这毁灭就在一瞬间，像一只秃鹫扑向他们的幸福，又好似一八一二年伤寒突然袭击驻扎在俄罗斯的法国大军一样。夏尔·米尼翁只用了一个晚上，就考虑清楚了接下来该怎么办。他一整晚都在和迪迈一起算账。他所有的家产，包括家具在内，全部卖掉，正好能够还清债务。","In January, 1826, on the day when Havre had unanimously chosen Charles Mignon as its deputy, three letters, arriving from New York, Paris, and London, fell with the destruction of a hammer upon the crystal palace of his prosperity.In an instant ruin like a vulture swooped down upon their happiness, just as the cold fell in 1812 upon the grand army in Russia.One night sufficed Charles Mignon to decide upon his course, and he spent it in settling his accounts with Dumay.All he owned, not excepting his furniture, would just suffice to pay his creditors."
"“勒阿弗尔人民永远都不会看到我无所作为，”中校对中尉说道，“迪迈，我把你的六万法郎带走，利息按六分计算。”","“Havre shall never see me doing nothing,” said the colonel to the lieutenant.“Dumay, I take your sixty thousand francs at six per cent.”"
"“三分好了，中校。”","“Three, my colonel.”"
"“那干脆别算了，”米尼翁果断地说道，“我现在新开张的生意，赚的钱都有一份。‘莫黛斯特’号已经不是我的了，它明天出航，我也乘它而去。我把妻子和女儿交给你照顾了。我不会给你们写信。没有消息就是好消息。”","“At nothing, then,” cried Mignon, peremptorily; “you shall have your share in the profits of what I now undertake.The ‘Modeste,’ which is no longer mine, sails tomorrow, and I sail in her.I commit to you my wife and daughter.I shall not write.No news must be taken as good news.”"
"迪迈对他的中校从来都是言听计从，没有问任何问题。“我想，”他心照不宣地看了拉图奈尔看了一眼，说道，“我的中校已经有计划了。”","Dumay, always subordinate, asked no questions of his colonel.“I think,” he said to Latournelle with a knowing little glance, “that my colonel has a plan laid out.”"
"第二天清晨，他陪着主人，把他送上了开往君士坦丁堡的“莫黛斯特”号。就在那里，在船尾，这个布列塔尼人对这个普罗旺斯人说道：","The following day at dawn he accompanied his master on board the “Modeste” bound for Constantinople.There, on the poop of the vessel, the Breton said to the Provencal,—"
"“中校，你还有什么最后的吩咐吗？”","“What are your last commands, my colonel?”"
"“不要让任何人进入木屋，”这位父亲情绪激动地喊道，“迪迈，你要像一只斗牛犬那样保护我最后一个孩子。谁再敢勾引我女儿，就要他的命！什么都别怕，哪怕是上断头台——我会跟你一起的。”","“That no man shall enter the Chalet,” cried the father with strong emotion.“Dumay, guard my last child as though you were a bull-dog.Death to the man who seduces another daughter!Fear nothing, not even the scaffold—I will be with you.”"
"“中校，你安心地去吧。我明白了。你回来的时候，会看到莫黛斯特小姐和你走时一样好好的，不然你就要我的命好了。你知道我的，也知道你的比利牛斯猎犬。没有人能靠近你的女儿。原谅我，对你啰嗦了这么多。”","“My colonel, go in peace.I understand you.You shall find Mademoiselle Mignon on your return such as you now give her to me, or I shall be dead.You know me, and you know your Pyrenees hounds.No man shall reach your daughter.Forgive me for troubling you with words.”"
"这两名士兵互相拥抱，他们在荒凉的西伯利亚学会了惺惺相惜。","The two soldiers clasped arms like men who had learned to understand each other in the solitudes of Siberia."
"就在同一天，《勒阿弗尔邮报》登出了这样一条惊心动魄、简洁有力而又不失体面的消息：","On the same day the Havre “Courier” published the following terrible, simple, energetic, and honorable notice:—"
"“夏尔·米尼翁商号宣告破产。但这处房产的署名人、代理人承担了偿清所有债务的责任。即日起，支票持有者可以贴现到期票据。通过出售不动产，完全可以偿还目前所有的债务。","“The house of Charles Mignon suspends payment.But the undersigned, assignees of the estate, undertake to pay all liabilities.On and after this date, holders of notes may obtain the usual discount.The sale of the landed estates will fully cover all current indebtedness."
"“为了保证商号的信誉，并防止本市金融市场出现紊乱，特此通告。","“This notice is issued for the honor of the house, and to prevent any disturbance in the money-market of this town."
"“夏尔·米尼翁先生已于今晨乘“莫黛斯特”号前往小亚细亚，全权委托我们变卖他所有的家产，包括不动产和个人财产。","“Monsieur Charles Mignon sailed this morning on the ‘Modeste’ for Asia Minor, leaving full powers with the undersigned to sell his whole property, both landed and personal."
"银行账户代理人迪迈，城乡财产公证人、代理人拉图奈尔，商业资产代理人哥本　　　　　　　海姆。”","DUMAY, assignee of the Bank accounts, LATOURNELLE, notary, assignee of the city and villa property, GOBENHEIM, assignee of the commercial property.”"
"拉图奈尔之所以有今天的成就，全靠米尼翁先生对他的好心帮助。一八一七年，米尼翁先生借给他十万法郎买下了勒阿弗尔最好的律师事务所。这个可怜的人，差不多四十岁的时候还身无分文，除了当个首席文书，他的余生看不到任何前途。在勒阿弗尔，只有他的忠心能与迪迈相提并论。至于哥本海姆，他在清算的时候捞了便宜，把米尼翁先生的一部分生意接了过去，从而让他自己那个小银行有了点名气。","Latournelle owed his prosperity to the kindness of Monsieur Mignon, who lent him one hundred thousand francs in 1817 to buy the finest law practice in Havre.The poor man, who had no pecuniary means, was nearly forty years of age and saw no prospect of being other than head-clerk for the rest of his days.He was the only man in Havre whose devotion could be compared with Dumay’s.As for Gobenheim, he profited by the liquidation to get a part of Monsieur Mignon’s business, which lifted his own little bank into prominence."
"交易所、港口、私人商号，所有的人都对这一灾难表示惋惜，他们交口称赞这位无可指责、受人敬重且乐善好施的先生。而拉图奈尔和迪迈则像蚂蚁一样默默地四处奔波，变卖地产，把财产兑成现钱，还债，打点一切事务。维尔坎摆出十分慷慨的样子，买下了别墅、市内的房子，还有一处农场。拉图奈尔也利用这一点，尽量让他出了个好价钱。社交场上的人想去看望米尼翁夫人和小姐，但她们听从了夏尔最后的叮嘱，暂避到木屋里。她们就是在夏尔动身的那天早上搬到木屋去的，他向她们隐瞒了他出发的具体时间。这位勇敢的男人，为了不让离别的悲伤动摇他的决心，在他的妻子和女儿还在熟睡时便同她们告别了。三百张名片留在了他们家门口。半个月过后，正如夏尔所预料的那样，人们已经将木屋忘得一干二净了。这也向她们证实了米尼翁先生的这个命令多么英明、伟大。","While unanimous regrets for the disaster were expressed in counting-rooms, on the wharves, and in private houses, where praises of a man so irreproachable, honorable, and beneficent filled every mouth, Latournelle and Dumay, silent and active as ants, sold land, turned property into money, paid the debts, and settled up everything.Vilquin showed a good deal of generosity in purchasing the villa, the town-house, and a farm; and Latournelle made the most of his liberality by getting a good price out of him.Society wished to show civilities to Madame and Mademoiselle Mignon; but they had already obeyed the father’s last wishes and taken refuge in the Chalet, where they went on the very morning of his departure, the exact hour of which had been concealed from them.Not to be shaken in his resolution by his grief at parting, the brave man said farewell to his wife and daughter while they slept.Three hundred visiting cards were left at the house.A fortnight later, just as Charles had predicted, complete forgetfulness settled down upon the Chalet, and proved to these women the wisdom and dignity of his command."
"迪迈派了代理人代表他的东家到纽约、巴黎和伦敦去，跟踪这三家银行的账务清算，勒阿弗尔商号的破产就是由这三家银行引起的。最后，一八二六年到一八二八年间，夏尔的财产共剩余五十万法郎，相当于他全部财产的八分之一。然后，根据夏尔离开前那天晚上的指示，他把这些钱通过蒙日诺银行汇到夏尔·米尼翁先生在纽约的账户上。这一切就像在部队那样规规矩矩地执行了。但有一件事迪迈没有照办，就是中校叮嘱他说要从中拿出三万法郎来作为米尼翁夫人和小姐的个人费用。这位布列塔尼人以两万法郎的价格卖掉了他自己的小房子，并全部交给了米尼翁夫人。他相信，给上校汇去的资金越多，他回来得就越快。","Dumay sent agents to represent his master in New York, Paris, and London, and followed up the assignments of the three banking-houses whose failure had caused the ruin of the Havre house, thus realizing five hundred thousand francs between 1826 and 1828, an eighth of Charles’s whole fortune; then, according to the latter’s directions given on the night of his departure, he sent that sum to New York through the house of Mongenod to the credit of Monsieur Charles Mignon.All this was done with military obedience, except in a matter of withholding thirty thousand francs for the personal expenses of Madame and Mademoiselle Mignon as the colonel had ordered him to do, but which Dumay did not do.The Breton sold his own little house for twenty thousand francs, which sum he gave to Madame Mignon, believing that the more capital he sent to his colonel the sooner the latter would return."
"“或许，就是缺这三万法郎让他完蛋了。”迪迈对拉图奈尔说道。拉图奈尔按照它所值的价钱全额买下了这间小屋，并一直为木屋里的人留着一套客房。","“He might perish for the want of thirty thousand francs,” Dumay remarked to Latournelle, who bought the little house at its full value, where an apartment was always kept ready for the inhabitants of the Chalet."
"第四章 一个简短的故事","Chapter IV A Simple Story"
"这便是勒阿弗尔著名的米尼翁商号在一八二五到一八二六年间这场危机中的结局。这场危机给欧洲许多其他重要的商业中心带来了巨大震动，并导致巴黎好几位银行家破产，其中还有一位商会会长（对那场危机有印象的人应该都能想起来）。","Such was the result to the celebrated house of Mignon at Havre of the crisis of 1825–26, which convulsed many of the principal business centres in Europe and caused the ruin of several Parisian bankers, among them (as those who remember that crisis will recall) the president of the chamber of commerce."
"现在，我们可以明白，在历经了十年的家庭幸福后，这场突如其来的灾难对贝蒂娜·米尼翁是个多么致命的打击。她再次与丈夫分离，对他的命运全然不知，对她来说，这同丈夫被流放西伯利亚时一样危险、前途未卜。但真正把她引向坟墓的，远不是这些看得见的悲伤。那慢慢侵蚀着她内心的痛苦，藏在安古维尔小墓地里的一块墓碑下，墓碑上写的是：","We can now understand how this great disaster, coming suddenly at the close of ten years of domestic happiness, might well have been the death of Bettina Mignon, again separated from her husband and ignorant of his fate,—to her as adventurous and perilous as the exile to Siberia.But the grief which was dragging her to the grave was far other than these visible sorrows.The caustic that was slowly eating into her heart lay beneath a stone in the little graveyard of Ingouville, on which was inscribed:—"
"贝蒂娜·卡罗琳·米尼翁","BETTINA CAROLINE MIGNON"
"卒年二十二岁","Died aged twenty-two."
"为她祈祷吧。","Pray for her."
"墓碑上给这位少女的献词，跟其他许多死者的墓志铭一样，是一本不为人知的书的目录。就是这本书，极其简练的一本书，将解释上校和中尉告别时互相立下的誓言。","This inscription is to the young girl whom it covered what many another epitaph has been for the dead lying beneath them,—a table of contents to a hidden book.Here is the book, in its dreadful brevity; and it will explain the oath exacted and taken when the colonel and the lieutenant bade each other farewell."
"一个外表俊朗的年轻人，名叫夏尔·德埃斯图尼，跟其他人一样为了亲近大海，来到了勒阿弗尔，并在那里看到了贝蒂娜·米尼翁。一位自命时髦的巴黎人是从不愁无人引见的。他应米尼翁家的一个朋友之邀，参加一场在安古维尔举办的游乐会。他爱上了贝蒂娜和她的财产，花了三个月的时间引诱她，并把她给拐走了。一位有女儿的父亲不能将他没读过的书和报纸随便乱放，同样也不能让一个他不了解的年轻人到他家里去。一个年轻姑娘的单纯就如同牛奶一样，一声惊雷、一股有害的气味、一个大热天，甚至只是一阵微风，都会使之变酸。","A young man of charming appearance, named Charles d’Estourny, came to Havre for the commonplace purpose of being near the sea, and there he saw Bettina Mignon.A “soi-disant” fashionable Parisian is never without introductions, and he was invited at the instance of a friend of the Mignons to a fete given at Ingouville.He fell in love with Bettina and with her fortune, and in three months he had done the work of seduction and enticed her away.The father of a family of daughters should no more allow a young man whom he does not know to enter his home than he should leave books and papers lying about which he has not read.A young girl’s innocence is like milk, which a small matter turns sour,—a clap of thunder, an evil odor, a hot day, a mere breath."
"夏尔·米尼翁读到女儿的诀别信时，马上派了迪迈夫人到巴黎去。家里人对外放出话，说家庭医生突然建议卡罗琳作一次旅行，换换气候。医生自己也一直坚持这个借口。尽管这样，还是不能阻止勒阿弗尔人的流言蜚语。“这么精力充沛的年轻姑娘！脸色跟西班牙女郎一样，而且长着一头黑发！——她竟然会得肺病！”“是啊，听说她是不小心得上的。”“啊，啊！”一个维尔坎家的人叫道，“我听说她骑马回来后大汗淋漓，浑身都湿透了，还喝了冰水，至少特鲁斯纳尔医生是这样说的。”","When Charles Mignon read his daughter’s letter of farewell he instantly despatched Madame Dumay to Paris.The family gave out that a journey to another climate had suddenly been advised for Caroline by their physician; and the physician himself sustained the excuse, though unable to prevent some gossip in the society of Havre.“Such a vigorous young girl! with the complexion of a Spaniard, and that black hair!—she consumptive!”“Yes, they say she committed some imprudence.”“Ah, ah!” cried a Vilquin.“I am told she came back bathed in perspiration after riding on horseback, and drank iced water; at least, that is what Dr. Troussenard says.”"
"迪迈夫人回到勒阿弗尔时，破产之灾已经降临，社会上的人也没再注意贝蒂娜的消失，以及账房总管夫人的归来。一八二七年初，报纸上充斥着审判夏尔·德埃斯图尼的消息，他被判赌博诈骗罪。这个年轻的盗贼丢下米尼翁小姐不管，跑到国外去了。自从她家银行破产之后，她对他而言就没有什么价值了。贝蒂娜几乎是在同一时间得知她已被那个无耻之徒抛弃，而她父亲也已经破产。她回到家时已是气息奄奄，没过多久就在木屋去世了。她的死亡至少保住了她的声誉。对于米尼翁先生称贝蒂娜离家是因为生病，还有家庭医生让贝蒂娜去尼斯养病的这些事，人们现在基本上信以为真了。直到最后一刻，母亲还是希望能挽救她女儿的生命。贝蒂娜是她的心头肉，而莫黛斯特则是父亲的心头肉。他们两人的偏爱都有其令人动容之处。贝蒂娜长得像夏尔，正如莫黛斯特跟她妈妈就像一个模子刻出来的一样。这对父母在他们的孩子身上继续爱着彼此。贝蒂娜——普罗旺斯的女儿，从他父亲那里继承了一头南方女子特有的鸦翅般黑亮的秀发，杏仁般的棕色眼睛像星星一样闪闪发亮，还有橄榄色的面容，犹如金果般的柔滑肌肤，拱形的脚背，以及像要撑破巴斯克式紧身衣的西班牙女子般的腰身。姐妹俩迥然不同、各具魅力，这令父母十分自豪。“一个魔鬼，一个天使！”他们笑着对彼此说道，却没想到竟然一语成谶。","By the time Madame Dumay returned to Havre the catastrophe of the failure had taken place, and society paid no further attention to the absence of Bettina or the return of the cashier’s wife.At the beginning of 1827 the newspapers rang with the trial of Charles d’Estourny, who was found guilty of cheating at cards.The young corsair escaped into foreign parts without taking thought of Mademoiselle Mignon, who was of little value to him since the failure of the bank.Bettina heard of his infamous desertion and of her father’s ruin almost at the same time.She returned home struck by death, and wasted away in a short time at the Chalet.Her death at least protected her reputation.The illness that Monsieur Mignon alleged to be the cause of her absence, and the doctor’s order which sent her to Nice were now generally believed.Up to the last moment the mother hoped to save her daughter’s life.Bettina was her darling and Modeste was the father’s.There was something touching in the two preferences.Bettina was the image of Charles, just as Modeste was the reproduction of her mother.Both parents continued their love for each other in their children.Bettina, a daughter of Provence, inherited from her father the beautiful hair, black as a raven’s wing, which distinguishes the women of the South, the brown eye, almond-shaped and brilliant as a star, the olive tint, the velvet skin as of some golden fruit, the arched instep, and the Spanish waist from which the short basque skirt fell crisply.Both mother and father were proud of the charming contrast between the sisters.“A devil and an angel!” they said to each other, laughing, little thinking it prophetic."
"整整一个月，这位母亲独自呆在房间里，每天以泪洗面，不让任何人进去，最后，重新在大家面前出现时，她已经患上了眼疾。在完全失明之前，她不顾朋友们的劝告，执意去了女儿的墓地，久久凝视着女儿的坟墓，陷入了沉思。那一幕一直清晰地留在如今她那黑暗的世界里，就像我们在大太阳底下闭上眼睛，仍能感觉到物体发出的红光。这可怕的双重打击丝毫没有减少迪迈的忠诚，而是使他更加担心莫黛斯特，因为她现在是她父亲唯一的女儿了，而她的父亲还不知道。迪迈夫人十分疼爱莫黛斯特，跟其他没有孩子的女人一样，她把她的慈母之爱都给了这个女孩。但她并没有忽视她丈夫的命令，他并不信任女性之间的那种亲密关系。这些命令简洁明了。“如果有任何男人，不管年纪多大，也不管身份地位，”迪迈说道，“敢跟莫黛斯特说话、向她抛媚眼，或向她示爱的话，那他就死定了。我会一枪打烂他的头，然后把自己交由法官处置。也许我的死就能救她。如果你不想看到我被砍头，就一定要在我外出办事时代我看着她。”","After weeping for a month in the solitude of her chamber, where she admitted no one, the mother came forth at last with injured eyes.Before losing her sight altogether she persisted, against the wishes of her friends, in visiting her daughter’s grave, on which she riveted her gaze in contemplation.That image remained vivid in the darkness which now fell upon her, just as the red spectrum of an object shines in our eyes when we close them in full daylight.This terrible and double misfortune made Dumay, not less devoted, but more anxious about Modeste, now the only daughter of the father who was unaware of his loss.Madame Dumay, idolizing Modeste, like other women deprived of their children, cast her motherliness about the girl,—yet without disregarding the commands of her husband, who distrusted female intimacies.Those commands were brief.“If any man, of any age, or any rank,” Dumay said, “speaks to Modeste, ogles her, makes love to her, he is a dead man.I’ll blow his brains out and give myself to the authorities; my death may save her.If you don’t wish to see my head cut off, do you take my place in watching her when I am obliged to go out.”"
"在过去的三年里，迪迈每天晚上都要检查他的手枪。他似乎还把他誓言的一半负担压到了那两只异常聪敏的比利牛斯猎犬身上。这两只猎犬一只睡在木屋里面，另一只驻扎在一间狗窝里，从不离开，也从不吠叫，但要是这两只狗在哪个不速之客身上咬一口，那这个家伙就惨了。","For the last three years Dumay had examined his pistols every night.He seemed to have put half the burden of his oath upon the Pyrenean hounds, two animals of uncommon sagacity.One slept inside the Chalet, the other was stationed in a kennel which he never left, and where he never barked; but terrible would have been the moment had the pair made their teeth meet in some unknown adventurer."
"现在，我们可以想象住在木屋里的这对母女过着怎样的生活了。拉图奈尔先生和夫人几乎每天晚上都到这里来拜访，和迪迈玩惠斯特牌，常常还有哥本海姆陪着。谈话总是围绕勒阿弗尔当地的一些传言，还有市区生活的一些琐事。这小小的聚会大约会在晚上九、十点钟散场。然后，莫黛斯特就服侍母亲上床睡觉，她们一起祷告，互相鼓励，并聊聊她们牵挂的那位旅人——米尼翁夫人的丈夫，莫黛斯特的父亲。莫黛斯特亲吻母亲、道过晚安后，在大约十点钟的时候回到自己的房间去。第二天早晨，她同样细心地帮母亲梳妆打扮，和她一起做同样的祷告，闲聊着同样的话题。说句夸奖的话，从那可怕的疾病夺去了她母亲视觉的那一天起，莫黛斯特就像她的仆人一样，始终如一地关心她，从不对所做的事感到疲倦，也从不觉得单调乏味。这种始终如一的孝顺，以及少女身上少有的温柔体贴，令所有的人赞不绝口。对于拉图奈尔一家，以及迪迈先生和迪迈夫人来说，莫黛斯特在道德品质方面就是一颗无价的珍珠。","We can now imagine the sort of life led by mother and daughter at the Chalet.Monsieur and Madame Latournelle, often accompanied by Gobenheim, came to call and play whist with Dumay nearly every evening.The conversation turned on the gossip of Havre and the petty events of provincial life.The little company separated between nine and ten o’clock.Modeste put her mother to bed, and together they said their prayers, kept up each other’s courage, and talked of the dear absent one, the husband and father.After kissing her mother for good-night, the girl went to her own room about ten o’clock.The next morning she prepared her mother for the day with the same care, the same prayers, the same prattle.To her praise be it said that from the day when the terrible infirmity deprived her mother of a sense, Modeste had been like a servant to her, displaying at all times the same solicitude; never wearying of the duty, never thinking it monotonous.Such constant devotion, combined with a tenderness rare among young girls, was thoroughly appreciated by those who witnessed it.To the Latournelle family, and to Monsieur and Madame Dumay, Modeste was, in soul, the pearl of price."
"天气晴朗的时候，在早餐和晚餐之间，米尼翁夫人和迪迈夫人会往海边散散步。莫黛斯特陪着她们一起，因为她失明的母亲两边都需要人搀扶。大约一个月前，有一天，迪迈夫人带着莫黛斯特到其他地方去散了很长时间的步，这期间，米尼翁夫人向她的朋友们——拉图奈尔夫人、公证人以及迪迈征求了意见。","On sunny days, between breakfast and dinner, Madame Mignon and Madame Dumay took a little walk toward the sea.Modeste accompanied them, for two arms were needed to support the blind mother.About a month before the scene to which this explanation is a parenthesis, Madame Mignon had taken counsel with her friends, Madame Latournelle, the notary, and Dumay, while Madame Dumay carried Modeste in another direction for a longer walk."
"“请听我说，”这位失明的女人说道，“我的女儿有喜欢的人了。我感觉到了，我看到了。她的内心已经发生了巨大的变化，我不明白，你们中怎么没有人发现这一点。”","“Listen to what I have to say,” said the blind woman.“My daughter is in love.I feel it; I see it.A singular change has taken place within her, and I do not see how it is that none of you have perceived it.”"
"“我的天哪——”中尉叫道。","“In the name of all that’s honorable—” cried the lieutenant."
"“迪迈，别打断我。在过去的两个月里，莫黛斯特十分注意个人打扮，就像要去跟情人约会似的。她变得对鞋子十分挑剔，想向人展现她那双漂亮的小脚，还责怪鞋店老板戈贝太太。她对给她做帽子的裁缝也是同样挑剔。有些日子，我那可怜的宝贝会陷入沉思，很明显是有所期待，像是在等什么人。我问她话，她总是三言两语地回答我，好像她的沉思和神秘的期盼被打断了一样。那么，如果她所等待的情人来了——”","“Don’t interrupt me, Dumay.For the last two months Modeste has taken as much care of her personal appearance as if she expected to meet a lover.She has grown extremely fastidious about her shoes; she wants to set off her pretty feet; she scolds Madame Gobet, the shoemaker.It is the same thing with her milliner.Some days my poor darling is absorbed in thought, evidently expectant, as if waiting for some one.Her voice has curt tones when she answers a question, as though she were interrupted in the current of her thoughts and secret expectations.Then, if this awaited lover has come—”"
"“天哪！”","“Good heavens!”"
"“迪迈，坐下。”这位失明的女人说道，“唉，莫黛斯特正心花怒放呢。噢！在你们眼里，她不是那么快乐，你们看不到她这些变化，对于只能看到大自然外在表象的眼睛，这些变化过于微妙了。她说话的语气，还有某些只有我能捕捉和理解的声调，使我感觉到了她的心花怒放。莫黛斯特不再端坐在那里沉思默想了，她内心充满了狂热，做事很冲动——总之，她很快乐。她表达的那些想法中透露着一种优雅与魅力。啊，朋友们，我虽然历尽悲伤，但我也同样了解幸福的滋味，我知道它的征兆。从我的莫黛斯特给我的亲吻中，我能猜测得到她心里在想什么。我知道她是否得到了她所期盼的，我知道她是惴惴不安，还是期盼着什么。一个亲吻当中是有许多细微差别的，就连一位天真无邪的少女也是如此，而莫黛斯特就是天真无邪的化身。但她的天真无邪不是无知的单纯，而是懂事的单纯。我虽然瞎了，但我那颗慈母之心是看得清的，我要你们监视我的女儿。”","“Sit down, Dumay,” said the blind woman.“Well, then Modeste is gay.Oh! she is not gay to your sight; you cannot catch these gradations; they are too delicate for eyes that see only the outside of nature.Her gaiety is betrayed to me by the tones of her voice, by certain accents which I alone can catch and understand.Modeste then, instead of sitting still and thoughtful, gives vent to a wild, inward activity by impulsive movements,—in short, she is happy.There is a grace, a charm in the very ideas she utters.Ah, my friends, I know happiness as well as I know sorrow; I know its signs.By the kiss my Modeste gives me I can guess what is passing within her.I know whether she has received what she was looking for, or whether she is uneasy or expectant.There are many gradations in a kiss, even in that of an innocent young girl, and Modeste is innocence itself; but hers is the innocence of knowledge, not of ignorance.I may be blind, but my tenderness is all-seeing, and I charge you to watch over my daughter.”"
"事实上，迪迈现在出奇愤怒，公证人一心要揭开谜底，女监护人拉图奈尔夫人感觉被欺骗了，而迪迈夫人则为她丈夫的安危感到担心。这些人马上组成了一个监视小团体，从那天开始，时刻不离莫黛斯特左右。每天晚上，迪迈都像个满腹狐疑的西班牙人一样，裹着大衣，蹲在莫黛斯特的窗下过夜，但即便凭借着他那军人的洞察力，他也没能查出任何蛛丝马迹。除非她爱上了别墅花园里的夜莺，或者是什么精灵王子，因为莫黛斯特不可能和任何人见过面，也没有发出或者收到任何信号。迪迈夫人每天都是等莫黛斯特睡着了之后才上床睡觉的，她像她丈夫一样警惕地从木屋别墅上面的窗户监视着马路上的情况。在这八只阿耳戈斯般的眼睛的注视下，这个清白的孩子的一举一动都被研究和分析过，最后，她终于经受住了考验，因并无私通之嫌而被无罪开释。这样一来，四位朋友私底下都认为是米尼翁夫人紧张过度了，实在有些可笑。一直以来，都是拉图奈尔夫人陪着莫黛斯特去教堂，再带她回来。于是大家派她去跟这位母亲说，是她误会了自己的女儿。","Dumay, now actually ferocious, the notary, in the character of a man bound to ferret out a mystery, Madame Latournelle, the deceived chaperone, and Madame Dumay, alarmed for her husband’s safety, became at once a set of spies, and Modeste from this day forth was never left alone for an instant.Dumay passed nights under her window wrapped in his cloak like a jealous Spaniard; but with all his military sagacity he was unable to detect the least suspicious sign.Unless she loved the nightingales in the villa park, or some fairy prince, Modeste could have seen no one, and had neither given nor received a signal.Madame Dumay, who never went to bed till she knew Modeste was asleep, watched the road from the upper windows of the Chalet with a vigilance equal to her husband’s.Under these eight Argus eyes the blameless child, whose every motion was studied and analyzed, came out of the ordeal so fully acquitted of all criminal conversation that the four friends declared to each other privately that Madame Mignon was foolishly over-anxious.Madame Latournelle, who always took Modeste to church and brought her back again, was commissioned to tell the mother that she was mistaken about her daughter."
"“莫黛斯特是一个道德高尚的年轻姑娘，”她说道，“她有时热衷于某位作家的诗歌，有时又沉醉于另外一个作家的散文。只要通过那首‘断头台交响乐’（比查语，他总是慷慨地把好点子提供给他的女恩人）《一个囚犯的末日》对她的影响，就能看出她对那位雨果先生的崇拜已经到了痴迷的地步。我真不晓得这些家伙（作为中产阶级的拉图奈尔夫人，自然会把维克多·雨果、拉马丁、拜伦这类人称作“这些家伙”）是从哪儿得到他们的灵感的。莫黛斯特总是跟我谈起恰尔德·哈罗尔德，而我为了能跟她好好探讨探讨，竟然傻到尝试去读这些东西。也许是译者的错吧，但它真的让我反胃，我读得头昏脑胀，根本不可能读完。为什么这个人要谈那些吼叫的对比，会晕过去的石头，还有战争的浪涛！然而，鉴于他只是个英国游子，作品中难免会有荒谬之处——不过他的那些东西实在是太不可理喻了。他把你带到西班牙，又把你裹入阿尔卑斯山顶的云雾之中，还让激流开口，让星星说话，他还说这世上贞女太多了！您听过这样的话吗？拿破仑打了胜仗之后，他的作品一页一页、字里行间满是响亮的军乐和燃烧的炮弹。莫黛斯特告诉我，那些矫揉造作之辞全是译者加进去的，而我应该读英文原版的。　但是，我都没学英语来教埃克絮佩，当然也不会学英语去读拜伦爵士的作品。比起所有这些英国传奇故事，我更喜欢迪克雷-迪梅尼的小说。我是一个太纯正的诺曼人，不喜欢外国的东西，尤其是英国的。”","“Modeste,” she said, “is a young girl of very exalted ideas; she works herself into enthusiasm for the poetry of one writer or the prose of another.You have only to judge by the impression made upon her by that scaffold symphony, ‘The Last Hours of a Convict’” (the saying was Butscha’s, who supplied wit to his benefactress with a lavish hand); “she seemed to me all but crazy with admiration for that Monsieur Hugo.I’m sure I don’t know where such people” (Victor Hugo, Lamartine, Byron being such people to the Madame Latournelles of the bourgeoisie) “get their ideas.Modeste kept talking to me of Childe Harold, and as I did not wish to get the worst of the argument I was silly enough to try to read the thing.Perhaps it was the fault of the translator, but it actually turned my stomach; I was dazed; I couldn’t possibly finish it.Why, the man talks about comparisons that howl, rocks that faint, and waves of war!However, he is only a travelling Englishman, and we must expect absurdities,—though his are really inexcusable.He takes you to Spain, and sets you in the clouds above the Alps, and makes the torrents talk, and the stars; and he says there are too many virgins!Did you ever hear the like?Then, after Napoleon’s campaigns, the lines are full of sonorous brass and flaming cannon-balls, rolling along from page to page.Modeste tells me that all that bathos is put in by the translator, and that I ought to read the book in English.But I certainly sha’n’t learn English to read Lord Byron when I didn’t learn it to teach Exupere.I much prefer the novels of Ducray-Dumenil to all these English romances.I’m too good a Norman to fall in love with foreign things,—above all when they come from England.”"
"虽然米尼翁夫人总是忧郁的，但想到拉图奈尔夫人读《恰尔德·哈罗尔德游记》的情景，也忍不住微笑了一下。而拉图奈尔夫人，这位严肃的国会人家的孩子，还以为这微笑是对她的信条的肯定呢。","Madame Mignon, notwithstanding her melancholy, could not help smiling at the idea of Madame Latournelle reading Childe Harold.The stern scion of a parliamentary house accepted the smile as an approval of her doctrine."
"“所以，亲爱的米尼翁夫人，”她接着说道，“莫黛斯特的迷恋只是由读书造成的，没有别的，您却以为她是恋爱了。记住，她才二十岁。女孩子在这个年龄段都是自恋的，她们爱打扮，是为了让自己看着舒服。我还记得我以前常让我那已过世的妹妹戴一顶男人的帽子，然后和我假扮先生和太太。您看，您在法兰克福度过了十分幸福的青年时代，但公平点儿说，莫黛斯特在这里的生活一点儿乐趣都没有。尽管她的每个愿望都的确得到了满足，但她仍知道自己被关起来了，还被看管着，除了读书之外，她的生活根本不能给她任何快乐。好了，别担心了，她谁都不爱，只爱您。您应该很高兴地看到她钟情于拜伦笔下的海盗、瓦尔特·司各特笔下的英雄，还有你们德国的一些男人，如埃格蒙特伯爵、歌德、维特、席勒等等。”","“And, therefore, my dear Madame Mignon,” she went on, “you have taken Modeste’s fancies, which are nothing but the results of her reading, for a love-affair.Remember, she is just twenty.Girls fall in love with themselves at that age; they dress to see themselves well-dressed.I remember I used to make my little sister, now dead, put on a man’s hat and pretend we were monsieur and madame.You see, you had a very happy youth in Frankfort; but let us be just,—Modeste is living here without the slightest amusement.Although, to be sure, her every wish is attended to, still she knows she is shut up and watched, and the life she leads would give her no pleasure at all if it were not for the amusement she gets out of her books.Come, don’t worry yourself; she loves nobody but you.You ought to be very glad that she goes into these enthusiasms for the corsairs of Byron and the heroes of Walter Scott and your own Germans, Egmont, Goethe, Werther, Schiller, and all the other ‘ers.’”"
"“咳，夫人，您怎么看呢？”看到米尼翁夫人一言不发，迪迈有些惊慌，于是恭敬地问道。","“Well, madame, what do you say to that?” asked Dumay, respectfully, alarmed at Madame Mignon’s silence."
"“莫黛斯特并不仅仅是想要恋爱，而是已经爱上了某个男人。”这位母亲固执地说道。","“Modeste is not only inclined to love, but she loves some man,” answered the mother, obstinately."
"“夫人，这对我来说是性命攸关的事情，您一定要允许我——不是为了我自己，而是为了我的妻子，我的中校，为了我们所有人——将这个问题追根到底，看看究竟是母亲被欺骗了，还是监视人被欺骗了。”","“Madame, my life is at stake, and you must allow me—not for my sake, but for my wife, my colonel, for all of us—to probe this matter to the bottom, and find out whether it is the mother or the watch-dog who is deceived.”"
"“迪迈，是你被欺骗了啊！唉！要是我能看见我女儿就好了！”这个可怜的女人喊道。","“It is you who are deceived, Dumay.Ah! if I could but see my daughter!” cried the poor woman."
"“但她的意中人会是谁呢？”公证人问道，“肯定不是埃克絮佩。”","“But whom is it possible for her to love?” asked the notary.“I’ll answer for my Exupere.”"
"“也不会是哥本海姆，”迪迈说，“因为自从中校走后，他每周在这座房子里呆的时间连九个小时到不了。况且，那个只认得钱的家伙甚至都没怎么注意过莫黛斯特！他的叔叔哥本海姆-凯勒总是给他写信说：‘先赚足了钱，再来娶我们凯勒家的姑娘。’他脑子里净想着这件事了，估计连莫黛斯特是男是女都不晓得。除此之外，再没有其他男人来过这里了——当然我没把比查这个可怜的小家伙算进来，我很喜欢他！夫人，他就是你的迪迈，”账房总管对拉图奈尔夫人说道，“比查很清楚，哪怕是看莫黛斯特一眼，都会让他遭受布列塔尼式浸刑。再没有别人跟我们打交道了。夫人，自从你们——你们遭难以来，拉图奈尔夫人就一直陪莫黛斯特去教堂，在路上还有整个礼拜过程中都细心地观察她，并没发现什么可疑之处。总之，如果我还有什么需要坦白的话，那就是我上个月每天晚上都会把房子周围的所有小路耙一遍，但到了早上也没发现过任何足迹。”","“It can’t be Gobenheim,” said Dumay, “for since the colonel’s departure he has not spent nine hours a week in this house.Besides, he doesn’t even notice Modeste—that five-franc piece of a man!His uncle Gobenheim–Keller is all the time writing him, ‘Get rich enough to marry a Keller.’With that idea in his mind you may be sure he doesn’t know which sex Modeste belongs to.No other men ever come here,—for of course I don’t count Butscha, poor little fellow; I love him!He is your Dumay, madame,” said the cashier to Madame Latournelle.“Butscha knows very well that a mere glance at Modeste would cost him a Breton ducking.Not a soul has any communication with this house.Madame Latournelle who takes Modeste to church ever since your—your misfortune, madame, has carefully watched her on the way and all through the service, and has seen nothing suspicious.In short, if I must confess the truth, I have myself raked all the paths about the house every evening for the last month, and found no trace of footsteps in the morning.”"
"“耙子既不贵，用起来也不难。”这位德国人的女儿说道。","“Rakes are neither costly nor difficult to handle,” remarked the daughter of Germany."
"“但是还有狗呢？”迪迈叫道。","“But the dogs?” cried Dumay."
"“情郎们甚至会给狗吃迷药。”米尼翁夫人答道。","“Lovers have philters even for dogs,” answered Madame Mignon."
"“如果被您说中了，那我真是无地自容了！我还是拿枪打烂自己的脑袋吧。”迪迈喊道。","“If you are right, my honor is lost!I may as well blow my brains out,” exclaimed Dumay."
"“为什么要这样呢，迪迈？”这位失明的女人说道。","“Why so, Dumay?” said the blind woman."
"“唉，夫人，中校临走时在船上跟我说：‘迪迈，如果莫黛斯特的名声受到了威胁，那你就是冒着上断头台的危险，也不能袖手旁观。’要是中校不能看到他的女儿——现在是他唯一的女儿——还像过去那样纯洁高尚，那我永远都不敢正视他的眼睛了。”","“Ah, madame, I could never meet my colonel’s eye if he did not find his daughter—now his only daughter—as pure and virtuous as she was when he said to me on the vessel, ‘Let no fear of the scaffold hinder you, Dumay, if the honor of my Modeste is at stake.’”"
"“唉！我仿佛又看到了你俩的身影。”米尼翁夫人动情地说道。","“Ah! I recognize you both,” said Madame Mignon in a voice of strong emotion."
"“我以神对我灵魂的拯救打赌，莫黛斯特还是像在摇篮里时那样纯洁。”迪迈夫人喊道。","“I’ll wager my salvation that Modeste is as pure as she was in her cradle,” exclaimed Madame Dumay."
"“好吧，如果伯爵夫人同意我采用某些手段试一试，”迪迈答道，“我会把事情弄得水落石出，因为姜还是老的辣。”","“Well, I shall make certain of it,” replied her husband, “if Madame la Comtesse will allow me to employ certain means; for old troopers understand strategy.”"
"“只要不伤害我这最后一个孩子，我允许你做任何事情，来让我们搞清楚这个问题。”","“I will allow you to do anything that shall enlighten us, provided it does no injury to my last child.”"
"“让，你要做什么？”迪迈夫人问道，“要是一个女孩子想藏住一个秘密，你怎么能发现呢？”","“What are you going to do, Jean?” asked Madame Dumay; “how can you discover a young girl’s secret if she means to hide it?”"
"“所有人，都听我的！”中尉叫道，“我需要你们每个人帮忙。”","“Obey me, all!” cried the lieutenant, “I shall need every one of you.”"
"如果以上这段简洁的描述得以被清晰地拓展，那将会是一幅完整的社会风俗画，许多家庭都可以从中看到他们家族史上发生的种种事件。但在这里，我们只要对这个难忘的夜晚中的一些人和事略加解释就够了。那天晚上，这位老兵已经为这个年轻姑娘设计好了一个局，旨在把藏在莫黛斯特内心深处的秘密发掘出来。这个秘密关乎她的爱情，关乎她爱的人，目前只有她失明的母亲发现了。","If this rapid sketch were clearly developed it would give a whole picture of manners and customs in which many a family could recognize the events of their own history; but it must suffice as it is to explain the importance of the few details heretofore given about persons and things on the memorable evening when the old soldier had made ready his plot against the young girl, intending to wrench from the recesses of her heart the secret of a love and a lover seen only by a blind mother."
"第五章 未解之谜","Chapter V The Problem Still Unsolved"
"一个小时的时间就在这种严肃、沉寂的气氛中过去了，只有玩惠斯特牌的人那些奇怪的词句会不时地打破这宁静：“黑桃！”“王牌！”“切牌！”“比分多少？”“二比四。”“该谁发牌了？”——在如今这个时代，这些词句代表了欧洲贵族阶层昂扬的激情。莫黛斯特继续着手里的活儿，好像没有对她母亲的沉默感到奇怪。米尼翁夫人的手帕从膝头滑落到了地上，比查马上跑过去把它捡了起来。就在他把手帕放回米尼翁夫人膝头的时候，他在莫黛斯特的耳边低声说道：“小心！”莫黛斯特抬起眼睛，目光里满是惊讶，她那疑惑的眼光使这个可怜的跛子心中充满了无以言表的喜悦。“她没恋爱！”他一边自言自语，一边搓着手，手上的皮都快被搓掉了。就在这时，埃克絮佩飞奔着穿过花园和屋子，猛地冲进客厅，以大家都能听见的音量冲迪迈耳语道：“那个年轻人来了！”迪迈一跃而起，拿起手枪冲了出去。","An hour went by in solemn stillness broken only by the cabalistic phrases of the whist-players: “Spades!”“Trumped!”“Cut!”“How are honors?”“Two to four.”“Whose deal?”—phrases which represent in these days the higher emotions of the European aristocracy.Modeste continued to work, without seeming to be surprised at her mother’s silence.Madame Mignon’s handkerchief slipped from her lap to the floor; Butscha precipitated himself upon it, picked it up, and as he returned it whispered in Modeste’s ear, “Take care!”Modeste raised a pair of wondering eyes, whose puzzled glance filled the poor cripple with joy unspeakable.“She is not in love!” he whispered to himself, rubbing his hands till the skin was nearly peeled off.At this moment Exupere tore through the garden and the house, plunged into the salon like an avalanche, and said to Dumay in an audible whisper, “The young man is here!”Dumay sprang for his pistols and rushed out."
"“我的天哪！要是他把那个人杀了怎么办！”迪迈夫人哭喊道。","“Good God! suppose he kills him!” cried Madame Dumay, bursting into tears. "
"“出什么事了？”莫黛斯特天真地看着她的朋友们，没有表现出一丝恐惧。","“What is the matter?” asked Modeste, looking innocently at her friends and not betraying the slightest fear."
"“就是有个年轻人，老在房子周围晃来晃去。”拉图奈尔夫人叫道。","“It is all about a young man who is hanging round the house,” cried Madame Latournelle."
"“那么，”莫黛斯特说，“迪迈为什么要杀他呢？”","“Well!” said Modeste, “why should Dumay kill him?”"
"“天真的圣女啊！”比查突然叫道。他自豪地看着自己的东家，就像勒布伦的名画里亚历山大凝视着巴比伦那样。","“Sancta simplicita!” ejaculated Butscha, looking at his master as proudly as Alexander is made to contemplate Babylon in Lebrun’s great picture."
"“莫黛斯特，你要去哪儿？”当她的女儿起身要离开房间时，这位母亲问道。","“Where are you going, Modeste?” asked the mother as her daughter rose to leave the room."
"“准备服侍您就寝，妈妈。”莫黛斯特答道，声音就像乐器的音调一样纯净。","“To get ready for your bedtime, mamma,” answered Modeste, in a voice as pure as the tones of an instrument."
"“您亏本了吧。”迪迈回来的时候，矮子对他说道。","“You haven’t paid your expenses,” said the dwarf to Dumay when he returned."
"“莫黛斯特就像我们神坛上的圣女一样纯洁。”拉图奈尔夫人大声说道。","“Modeste is as pure as the Virgin on our altar,” cried Madame Latournelle."
"“我的天哪！这种惊心动魄的事令我精疲力竭，”迪迈说，“不过还好我体格健壮。”","“Good God! such excitements wear me out,” said Dumay; “and yet I’m a strong man.”"
"“要是我对你们要做的事有那么一点儿头绪的话，我情愿输掉二十五个苏。”哥本海姆说道。“我看你们都疯了。”","“May I lose that twenty-five sous if I have the slightest idea what you are about,” remarked Gobenheim.“You seem to me to be crazy.”"
"“可这一切都与一笔财富有关。”比查踮起脚尖，在哥本海姆的耳边轻声说道。","“And yet it is all about a treasure,” said Butscha, standing on tiptoe to whisper in Gobenheim’s ear."
"“迪迈，很抱歉地告诉你，对于我跟你说过的事情，我几乎还是肯定的。”米尼翁夫人还是坚持她的看法。","“Dumay, I am sorry to say that I am still almost certain of what I told you,” persisted Madame Mignon."
"“夫人，举证的责任现在就在您身上了，”迪迈镇定地说，“该由您来证明我们都是错的了。”","“The burden of proof is now on you, madame,” said Dumay, calmly; “it is for you to prove that we are mistaken.”"
"哥本海姆发现这一切无非是有关莫黛斯特的声誉的事，很明显要再分出个胜负是不可能的了。于是他便拿起帽子，鞠了一躬，带着他的十个苏走了。","Discovering that the matter in question was only Modeste’s honor, Gobenheim took his hat, made his bow, and walked off, carrying his ten sous with him,—there being evidently no hope of another rubber."
"“埃克絮佩，还有你，比查，你们可以走了，”拉图奈尔夫人说道。“回勒阿弗尔去，你们还可以赶上剧院的最后一出戏。票钱我来出。”","“Exupere, and you too, Butscha, may leave us,” said Madame Latournelle.“Go back to Havre; you will get there in time for the last piece at the theatre.I’ll pay for your tickets.”"
"等到只剩这四个朋友跟米尼翁夫人单独相处的时候，拉图奈尔夫人看了看迪迈，他是布列塔尼人，能够理解这位母亲的固执。她又看了看正拨弄着纸牌的丈夫，感觉自己有责任说点什么了。","When the four friends were alone with Madame Mignon, Madame Latournelle, after looking at Dumay, who being a Breton understood the mother’s obstinacy, and at her husband who was fingering the cards, felt herself authorized to speak up."
"“来吧，米尼翁夫人，告诉我们是什么决定性的事情让您有了这种想法。”","“Madame Mignon, come now, tell us what decisive thing has struck your mind.”"
"“啊，我的好朋友，如果你是一位音乐家，你就会像我一样，听到莫黛斯特说话时充满爱意的语言了。”","“Ah, my good friend, if you were a musician you would have heard, as I have, the language of love that Modeste speaks.”"
"从城区房子搬到木屋的几件家具中，就有两位米尼翁小姐的那架钢琴。莫黛斯特常常通过自己练习钢琴来消除烦恼，不用老师教。她是个天生的音乐家，通过弹钢琴来让她母亲高兴。她还有一副天生的好歌喉，很喜爱她母亲教给她的那些德国小曲。有了母亲的传授，再加上努力自学，莫黛斯特便能作一些温柔的抒情小曲了——虽然她不懂和声学，还谈不上严格意义上的作曲。对于她这样天生富有音乐才能的人来说，也不算什么奇事。旋律之于音乐，正如意象和情感之于诗歌，是一朵自然绽放的鲜花。于是，在有和声学之前，各个国家就有了自己的音乐旋律，植物学也是在有花草之后才诞生的。同样，莫黛斯特除了看过姐姐画水彩画之外，对画画这门艺术一无所知。但站在拉斐尔、提香、鲁本斯、牟利罗、伦勃朗、阿尔贝·丢勒以及霍尔拜因的画作跟前——也就是说，在世界各国美的典范面前——她会被那些画面所征服，并陶醉其中。近来，至少有一个月了，莫黛斯特总是用柔和的颤声哼唱着夜曲和优美的狂想曲，曲调中的诗情和深意已经引起了她母亲的注意。女儿突发的创作热情，还有对给诗歌谱曲的迷恋，让她十分惊讶。","The piano of the demoiselles Mignon was among the few articles of furniture which had been moved from the town-house to the Chalet.Modeste often conjured away her troubles by practising, without a master.Born a musician, she played to enliven her mother.She sang by nature, and loved the German airs which her mother taught her.From these lessons and these attempts at self-instruction came a phenomenon not uncommon to natures with a musical vocation; Modeste composed, as far as a person ignorant of the laws of harmony can be said to compose, tender little lyric melodies.Melody is to music what imagery and sentiment are to poetry, a flower that blossoms spontaneously.Consequently, nations have had melodies before harmony,—botany comes later than the flower.In like manner, Modeste, who knew nothing of the painter’s art except what she had seen her sister do in the way of water-color, would have stood subdued and fascinated before the pictures of Raphael, Titian, Rubens, Murillo, Rembrandt, Albert Durer, Holbein,—in other words, before the great ideals of many lands.Lately, for at least a month, Modeste had warbled the songs of nightingales, musical rhapsodies whose poetry and meaning had roused the attention of her mother, already surprised by her sudden eagerness for composition and her fancy for putting airs into certain verses."
"“如果您的怀疑没有其他依据的话，”拉图奈尔对米尼翁夫人说道，“我对您的敏感脆弱深表同情。”","“If your suspicions have no other foundation,” said Latournelle to Madame Mignon, “I pity your susceptibilities.”"
"“当一个布列塔尼女孩唱歌时，”迪迈郁郁地说，“她的情人就在不远处。”","“When a Breton girl sings,” said Dumay gloomily, “the lover is not far off.”"
"“莫黛斯特即兴创作时，我会让你们去听听的，”这位母亲说，“那样你们就可以自己去判断——”","“I will let you hear Modeste when she is improvising,” said the mother, “and you shall judge for yourselves—”"
"“可怜的女孩！”迪迈夫人说道，“如果她知道了我们的担忧，她会十分痛苦的，她会告诉我们真相，特别是如果她认为那样能救迪迈。”","“Poor girl!” said Madame Dumay, “If she only knew our anxiety she would be deeply distressed; she would tell us the truth,—especially if she thought it would save Dumay.”"
"“朋友们，明天我会问问我女儿。”米尼翁夫人说道，“也许我通过温柔的手段打探到的，会比你们用计谋发现的更多。”","“My friends, I will question my daughter tomorrow,” said Madame Mignon; “perhaps I shall obtain more by tenderness than you have discovered by trickery.”"
"这些忠诚的密探，这些正直的霸尔多洛，这些比利牛斯猎犬，他们刺探不出、察觉不到、甚至猜测不出意中人是谁、私情在哪里，连一点儿证据都抓不到。然而，是否就在他们的鼻子底下，正上演着那出无时无处不在上演的喜剧《关不住的少女》呢？但无论如何，这绝不是囚犯与看守争斗的结果，也不是地牢的专制同一名受害者的自由争斗的结果。这只是《创世纪》开幕时人类上演的第一幕戏的无休止重演——《夏娃在天堂》。","Was the comedy of the “Fille mal Gardee” being played here,—as it is everywhere and forever,—under the noses of these faithful spies, these honest Bartholos, these Pyrenean hounds, without their being able to ferret out, detect, nor even surmise the lover, the love-affair, or the smoke of the fire?At any rate it was certainly not the result of a struggle between the jailers and the prisoner, between the despotism of a dungeon and the liberty of a victim,—it was simply the never-ending repetition of the first scene played by man when the curtain of the Creation rose; it was Eve in Paradise."
"而现在，母亲和监视人，究竟哪一方是正确的呢？","And now, which of the two, the mother or the watch-dog, had the right of it?"
"莫黛斯特身边没有一个人能理解她那颗少女之心——因为她的心灵与我们已经描述过的她的面容是和谐一致的。这个姑娘已经将自己的存在移植到另外一个世界里去了。直至今天，这个世界还像十六世纪时克里斯托弗·哥伦布发现的新世界一样，被人们怀疑和否认。幸好她总是把想法藏在心里，不然人们会认为她疯了。但首先我们必须解释一下往事对她性格的影响。","None of the persons who were about Modeste could understand that maiden heart—for the soul and the face we have described were in harmony.The girl had transported her existence into another world, as much denied and disbelieved in in these days of ours as the new world of Christopher Columbus in the sixteenth century.Happily, she kept her own counsel, or they would have thought her crazy.But first we must explain the influence of the past upon her nature."
"有两件大事磨炼了这位少女的心灵，开发了她的才智。贝蒂娜遭受的厄运警醒了米尼翁先生和米尼翁夫人，就在家族破产之前，他们决定把莫黛斯特嫁出去。他们选择了一位富有的银行家的儿子，这位银行家以前是汉堡人，但从一八一五年起就在勒阿弗尔定居了。此外，这个人还受过他们的恩惠。年轻人名叫弗朗索瓦·阿尔图，是勒阿弗尔的花花公子，生来带有讨中产阶级喜欢的低俗美。他身材匀称，肌肉丰满，而且气色很好。他在莫黛斯特父亲破产的当天，便抛弃了他的未婚妻，从此，无论是莫黛斯特和她的母亲，还是迪迈一家，都没有再见过他。拉图奈尔曾就此事冒昧地问过他的父亲雅各布·阿尔图一个问题，但他只是耸耸肩膀，回答道：“我真的不明白你是什么意思。”","Two events had formed the soul and developed the mind of this young girl.Monsieur and Madame Mignon, warned by the fate that overtook Bettina, had resolved, just before the failure, to marry Modeste.They chose the son of a rich banker, formerly of Hamburg, but established in Havre since 1815,—a man, moreover, who was under obligations to them.The young man, whose name was Francois Althor, the dandy of Havre, blessed with a certain vulgar beauty in which the middle classes delight, well-made, well-fleshed, and with a fine complexion, abandoned his betrothed so hastily on the day of her father’s failure that neither Modeste nor her mother nor either of the Dumays had seen him since.Latournelle ventured a question on the subject to Jacob Althor, the father; but he only shrugged his shoulders and replied, “I really don’t know what you mean.”"
"为了给莫黛斯特增加一些生活经验，这个答复被转告给了她。再加上拉图奈尔和迪迈对这种懦弱地抛弃行为长篇大论地批判了很多次，莫黛斯特更加深刻地吸取了这个教训。夏尔·米尼翁的两个女儿像所有娇生惯养的孩子一样，所有的愿望都能得到满足。她们骑马外出，有自己专门的马匹和马夫，而且在其他方面也享有大胆冒险的自由。眼见自己有了一个正式的恋人，莫黛斯特便任由弗朗西斯克吻她的手，搂着她的腰扶她上马。她接受了他送的鲜花，还有所有那些表达柔情的小玩意，这些小东西多得足以把我们这位小姐围起来。她对两人之间的关系深信不疑，甚至还为他做了一只钱包。的确，这种关系对于高贵的心灵来说是坚不可摧的，但对于哥本海姆、维尔坎还有阿尔图之辈，却脆弱得如同蜘蛛网。","This answer, told to Modeste to give her some experience of life, was a lesson which she learned all the more readily because Latournelle and Dumay made many and long comments on the cowardly desertion.The daughters of Charles Mignon, like spoiled children, had all their wishes gratified; they rode on horseback, kept their own horses and grooms, and otherwise enjoyed a perilous liberty.Seeing herself in possession of an official lover, Modeste had allowed Francisque to kiss her hand, and take her by the waist to mount her.She accepted his flowers and all the little proofs of tenderness with which it is proper to surround the lady of our choice; she even worked him a purse, believing in such ties,—strong indeed to noble souls, but cobwebs for the Gobenheims, the Vilquins, and the Althors."
"米尼翁夫人和她的女儿搬到木屋后的第二年春天，弗朗西斯克·阿尔图曾到维尔坎家赴宴。越过草坪尽头的墙，他碰巧看到了莫黛斯特，竟然把头转了过去。一个半月后，他便同维尔坎家的大小姐完婚了。这样一来，年轻貌美且出身高贵的莫黛斯特便明白了，在恋爱的那整整三个月里，她对他而言只不过是一位“百万小姐”。她的贫穷已是众人皆知，这也同拉图奈尔一家人的小心谨慎，以及迪迈的警惕一样，成了完全阻止别人接近木屋的哨兵。有一段时间，米尼翁小姐的身份曾经是镇上人们的谈资，但他们只是为了侮辱她。","Some time during the spring which followed the removal of Madame Mignon and her daughter to the Chalet, Francisque Althor came to dine with the Vilquins.Happening to see Modeste over the wall at the foot of the lawn, he turned away his head.Six weeks later he married the eldest Mademoiselle Vilquin.In this way Modeste, young, beautiful, and of high birth, learned the lesson that for three whole months of her engagement she had been nothing more than Mademoiselle Million.Her poverty, well known to all, became a sentinel defending the approaches to the Chalet fully as well as the prudence of the Latournelles or the vigilance of Dumay.The talk of the town ran for a time on Mademoiselle Mignon’s position only to insult her."
"“可怜的女孩！她会怎么样？——当然会变成一个老姑娘。”","“Poor girl! what will become of her?—an old maid, of course.”"
"“真是苦命啊！原来整个世界都在她的脚下，她曾有机会嫁给弗朗西斯克·阿尔图，可现在没有谁愿意要她了！”","“What a fate! to have had the world at her feet; to have had the chance to marry Francisque Althor,—and now, nobody willing to take her!”"
"“享受过奢华的生活之后，她竟沦落到如此穷困的境地——”","“After a life of luxury, to come down to such poverty—”"
"而且，这些侮辱性的话不是背地里说的，也不是莫黛斯特想象出来的。她不止一次听前往安古维尔的勒阿弗尔的年轻男女们说过这些话，他们明明知道米尼翁夫人和她的女儿住在木屋里，在经过房子的时候却还是谈论着她们。这对母女竟然还愿意继续在她们曾显赫一时的地方生活，维尔坎的朋友们表示很诧异。透过关着的百叶窗后面那扇敞开的窗户，莫黛斯特有时能听到这样的侮辱之词：","And these insults were not uttered in secret or left to Modeste’s imagination; she heard them spoken more than once by the young men and the young women of Havre as they walked to Ingouville, and, knowing that Madame Mignon and her daughter lived at the Chalet, talked of them as they passed the house.Friends of the Vilquins expressed surprise that the mother and daughter were willing to live on among the scenes of their former splendor.From her open window behind the closed blinds Modeste sometimes heard such insolence as this:—"
"“我真的难以想象，她们怎么能够在那里生活。”有的人会在走过别墅草坪时这样说——也许是为了帮助维尔坎赶走他的房客。","“I am sure I can’t think how they can live there,” some one would say as he paced the villa lawn,—perhaps to assist Vilquin in getting rid of his tenant."
"“你觉得她们靠什么生活呢？她们没有任何挣钱的方式。”","“What do you suppose they live on? they haven’t any means of earning money.”"
"“我听说老太太已经瞎了。”","“I am told the old woman has gone blind.”"
"“米尼翁小姐还是那么漂亮吗？哎呀，她过去多么神气啊！咳，她现在可没马骑了。”","“Is Mademoiselle Mignon still pretty?Dear me, how dashing she used to be!Well, she hasn’t any horses now.”"
"这些充满恶意的胡言乱语纯粹是出于忌妒，要对过去进行报复。大多数年轻女孩听到这些话，火气都会窜到头顶，还有的会哭起来，更有甚者会气得抽筋。但莫黛斯特却一笑置之，就像我们在剧院看演员表演时那样微笑。她不会降低自己的尊严，去计较这些言论。","Most young girls on hearing these spiteful and silly speeches, born of an envy that now rushed, peevish and drivelling, to avenge the past, would have felt the blood mount to their foreheads; others would have wept; some would have undergone spasms of anger; but Modeste smiled, as we smile at the theatre while watching the actors.Her pride could not descend so low as the level of such speeches."
"另一件事比这些唯利是图的卑鄙言行更为严重。贝蒂娜·卡罗琳是在她妹妹的怀里死去的。在此之前，莫黛斯特始终怀着少女的忠诚，以及纯洁无暇的好奇心照顾着姐姐。在那些寂静的长夜里，姐妹俩曾互诉过许多心里话。在天真无邪的莫黛斯特眼中，可怜的贝蒂娜的命运是多么戏剧化呢？贝蒂娜只是通过悲伤才了解了爱，而她也是因爱而死的。在少女们心里，就算那个男人是个恶棍，他也仍是自己的恋人。激情是世间万物中绝对真实的东西，而且它从来都是至高无上的。尽管夏尔·德埃斯图尼是个赌徒、罪犯、浪荡子，但在这对姐妹的记忆里，他仍是勒阿弗尔游乐会上风度翩翩的巴黎公子，是女人们爱慕的对象。贝蒂娜相信她从卖弄风情的维尔坎夫人那里夺来了夏尔·德埃斯图尼，而对于莫黛斯特，他是她姐姐的幸福恋人。这种少女的爱慕要比所有的社会谴责都强烈。贝蒂娜觉得是法院弄错了，不然怎么会给一个爱了她六个月的男人判刑呢？他把她带到隐居处，在那里狂热地爱着她——我们可以补充说，他本可以自行其事的。于是，这位即将离世的姑娘给她的妹妹打了一剂爱情预防针。她们一起谈论着伟大的戏剧，这些戏剧又因她们的想象变得更加伟大。贝蒂娜将她妹妹的天真无邪带进了坟墓，给妹妹留下了知识，至少是获得知识的渴望。","The other event was more serious than these mercenary meannesses.Bettina Caroline died in the arms of her younger sister, who had nursed her with the devotion of girlhood, and the curiosity of an untainted imagination.In the silence of long nights the sisters exchanged many a confidence.With what dramatic interest was poor Bettina invested in the eyes of the innocent Modeste?Bettina knew love through sorrow only, and she was dying of it.Among young girls every man, scoundrel though he be, is still a lover.Passion is the one thing absolutely real in the things of life, and it insists on its supremacy.Charles d’Estourny, gambler, criminal, and debauchee, remained in the memory of the sisters, the elegant Parisian of the fetes of Havre, the admired of the womenkind.Bettina believed she had carried him off from the coquettish Madame Vilquin, and to Modeste he was her sister’s happy lover.Such adoration in young girls is stronger than all social condemnations.To Bettina’s thinking, justice had been deceived; if not, how could it have sentenced a man who had loved her for six months?—loved her to distraction in the hidden retreat to which he had taken her,—that he might, we may add, be at liberty to go his own way.Thus the dying girl inoculated her sister with love.Together they talked of the great drama which imagination enhances; and Bettina carried with her to the grave her sister’s ignorance, leaving her, if not informed, at least thirsting for information."
"然而，悔恨已经将毒牙深深刺入了贝蒂娜的心脏，使得她不得不对妹妹加以告诫。在她的忏悔中，她劝诫莫黛斯特要恪守本分，绝对服从。去世的那天晚上，她恳求妹妹记住这浸湿了枕头的泪水，不要重蹈覆辙，因为如果那样的话，就算受苦也无法获得救赎。贝蒂娜责怪自己给家庭带来了灾祸，并且因为无法得到父亲的原谅，在绝望中死去了。尽管她的悔恨感动了牧师，给了她无尽的安慰，她还是用尽最后一口气撕心裂肺地喊道：“噢，父亲！父亲！”“婚事未成之前，千万不要以心相许，”她在临死前一个小时对莫黛斯特说道，“最重要的是，在没有告诉爸爸妈妈所有情况之前，不要接受任何男子的好意。”","Nevertheless, remorse had set its fangs too sharply in Bettina’s heart not to force her to warn her sister.In the midst of her own confessions she had preached duty and implicit obedience to Modeste.On the evening of her death she implored her to remember the tears that soaked her pillow, and not to imitate a conduct which even suffering could not expiate.Bettina accused herself of bringing a curse upon the family, and died in despair at being unable to obtain her father’s pardon.Notwithstanding the consolations which the ministers of religion, touched by her repentance, freely gave her, she cried in heartrending tones with her latest breath: “Oh father! father!”“Never give your heart without your hand,” she said to Modeste an hour before she died; “and above all, accept no attentions from any man without telling everything to papa and mamma.”"
"这些话从现实意义来讲是如此的字真句切，在临死之际说出来，对莫黛斯特的影响，要比贝蒂娜要求她发下重誓大得多。这位即将离开人世的姑娘，像预言家那样有远见。她从枕头下面拿出一枚戒指，她早已让她忠诚的的女仆弗朗索瓦丝·科歇到勒阿弗尔请人在戒指上刻下“想想贝蒂娜，1827”这几个字。她把它戴到妹妹的手指上，请求她一直戴到结婚的时候。这样，这两个年轻女孩之间便出现了一种奇怪的复杂情绪，一方面是心酸的悔恨，另一方面则是被凛冽、无情的北风过早摧残了的、对短暂春光的天真幻想。然而她们所有的泪水、悔恨和回忆，都不及她们对邪恶的恐惧强烈。","These words, so earnest in their practical meaning, uttered in the hour of death, had more effect upon Modeste than if Bettina had exacted a solemn oath.The dying girl, farseeing as prophet, drew from beneath her pillow a ring which she had sent by her faithful maid, Francoise Cochet, to be engraved in Havre with these words, “Think of Bettina, 1827,” and placed it on her sister’s finger, begging her to keep it there until she married.Thus there had been between these two young girls a strange commingling of bitter remorse and the artless visions of a fleeting spring-time too early blighted by the keen north wind of desertion; yet all their tears, regrets and memories were always subordinate to their horror of evil."
"然而，可怜的姐姐受人引诱、又回来死在贫穷的屋檐下，这场惨剧，加上父亲的破产，未婚夫的卑贱，母亲因悲伤致瞎，这一切只是触及了莫黛斯特生活的表面。迪迈一家和拉图奈尔一家也只能从表面现象来对她作出判断，因为任何朋友的忠诚都不能代替母亲的眼睛。精致的小木屋四周都是迪迈培育的上等鲜花，屋内的生活却十分单调。这对母女如时钟一般规律的生活习惯，乡下人的端庄得体，母亲织毛线、女儿做缝纫时的惠斯特牌局，只有春秋分时海上风暴的咆哮声才能打破的寂静——这一派修道院般的宁静之下，其实掩盖着一种内心的躁动，一种思维的躁动，一种精神层面的躁动。有时候我们会想，年轻的女孩们怎么可能犯错。但这正是因为没有一个失明的母亲在自己尚为处女的心中那潜藏的幻想深处给出直觉的准绳。迪迈一家人都睡着的时候，莫黛斯特会打开她的窗户，像是等一位男子经过——一位她梦寐以求的男子，她期待中的、将她放到自己身后、在迪迈枪火下骑马离去的骑士。","Nevertheless, this drama of a poor seduced sister returning to die under a roof of elegant poverty, the failure of her father, the baseness of her betrothed, the blindness of her mother caused by grief, had touched the surface only of Modeste’s life, by which alone the Dumays and the Latournelles judged her; for no devotion of friends can take the place of a mother’s eye.The monotonous life in the dainty little Chalet, surrounded by the choice flowers which Dumay cultivated; the family customs, as regular as clock-work, the provincial decorum, the games at whist while the mother knitted and the daughter sewed, the silence, broken only by the roar of the sea in the equinoctial storms,—all this monastic tranquillity did in fact hide an inner and tumultuous life, the life of ideas, the life of the spiritual being.We sometimes wonder how it is possible for young girls to do wrong; but such as do so have no blind mother to send her plummet line of intuition to the depths of the subterranean fancies of a virgin heart.The Dumays slept when Modeste opened her window, as it were to watch for the passing of a man,—the man of her dreams, the expected knight who was to mount her behind him and ride away under the fire of Dumay’s pistols."
"姐姐的去世让她情绪十分低落，那段时间里，莫黛斯特埋头读书、心无旁骛。出生在一个双语家庭里，她的德语阅读和表达能力同法语一样好，她还同姐姐一起跟迪迈夫人学习了英语。她周围的人没有什么文化知识，也就很少在读书方面监督她。莫黛斯特便把英语、法语和德语的现代文学名著当作她的精神食粮。拜伦爵士、歌德、席勒、瓦尔特·司各特、雨果、拉马丁、克雷布、穆尔，十七、十八世纪的伟大作品，从历史、戏剧到小说，从阿斯脱利亚女神到曼侬·莱斯戈，从蒙田的《随笔集》到狄德罗，从法国中世纪的世俗故事到《新埃洛伊兹》——总之，三个国家的思想以混杂的意象充塞着少女的头脑。她的单纯、冷静，她天生的贞洁，都散发着高贵的气息，而通过阅读这些作品，她的头脑中又迸发出一种对天才的绝对崇拜，这种崇拜之情牢不可破、光芒四射、真挚而又强烈。对莫黛斯特而言，一本新书就是一个重大事件，一部让拉图奈尔夫人感到震惊的大作会使她高兴不已——同样，如果一部伟大的作品没能拨动她的心弦，那她就会不高兴。一种抒情的天性在她那颗充满青春美丽幻想的少女之心里汹涌着。但这燃烧的激情没有在日常生活的表象发出一丝光亮，它逃过了迪迈、他的妻子以及拉图奈尔一家人的眼睛，只有失明的母亲的耳朵听到了激情之火燃烧的劈啪声。","During the depression caused by her sister’s death Modeste flung herself into the practice of reading, until her mind became sodden in it.Born to the use of two languages, she could speak and read German quite as well as French; she had also, together with her sister, learned English from Madame Dumay.Being very little overlooked in the matter of reading by the people about her, who had no literary knowledge, Modeste fed her soul on the modern masterpieces of three literatures, English, French, and German.Lord Byron, Goethe, Schiller, Walter Scott, Hugo, Lamartine, Crabbe, Moore, the great works of the 17th and 18th centuries, history, drama, and fiction, from Astraea to Manon Lescaut, from Montaigne’s Essays to Diderot, from the Fabliaux to the Nouvelle Heloise,—in short, the thought of three lands crowded with confused images that girlish head, august in its cold guilelessness, its native chastity, but from which there sprang full-armed, brilliant, sincere, and strong, an overwhelming admiration for genius.To Modeste a new book was an event; a masterpiece that would have horrified Madame Latournelle made her happy,—equally unhappy if the great work did not play havoc with her heart.A lyric instinct bubbled in that girlish soul, so full of the beautiful illusions of its youth.But of this radiant existence not a gleam reached the surface of daily life; it escaped the ken of Dumay and his wife and the Latournelles; the ears of the blind mother alone caught the crackling of its flame."
"此时，莫黛斯特对一切寻常男子的深度鄙视，给她的脸上烙上了一种傲慢的神情，一种难以形容的、桀骜不驯的羞怯，这调和了她那日耳曼式的单纯，与她独特的思想十分契合。思考在她眉宇间犁出了一条浅浅的垄沟，而她额头上有一处头发看上去就像是这垄沟的延续，这就使得她那桀骜不驯的表情更加明显。她父亲很喜欢她的机灵，习惯称她为自己的“所罗门小寓言家”。这个可爱的孩子通过练习三种语言，嗓音变得非常圆润婉转。除此之外，她说话的音调也是甜美清新，如清脆的铃声般悦耳动听。如果说，这位母亲再也不能从她女儿的眉宇间看到贵族命运的标志，她还是能够从充满爱意之音的声调中观察出她心灵的发展变化。","The profound disdain which Modeste now conceived for ordinary men gave to her face a look of pride, an inexpressible untamed shyness, which tempered her Teutonic simplicity, and accorded well with a peculiarity of her head.The hair growing in a point above the forehead seemed the continuation of a slight line which thought had already furrowed between the eyebrows, and made the expression of untameability perhaps a shade too strong.The voice of this charming child, whom her father, delighting in her wit, was wont to call his “little proverb of Solomon,” had acquired a precious flexibility of organ through the practice of three languages.This advantage was still further enhanced by a natural bell-like tone both sweet and fresh, which touched the heart as delightfully as it did the ear.If the mother could no longer see the signs of a noble destiny upon her daughter’s brow, she could study the transitions of her soul’s development in the accents of that voice attuned to love."
"第六章 一位少女的初恋","Chapter VI A Maiden’s First Romance"
"莫黛斯特奋发读书一段时间之后，她那丰富的想象力又激发出一种神奇的能力，就是使自己成为梦境中的演员，在脑海中想象自己渴望的那些东西。那些想象已经生动到了近乎真实的地步。简言之，就是通过幻想来获得快乐——将她的年华在脑海中上演，结婚、变老、像查理五世那样参加自己的葬礼，在自己的内心上演生活的喜剧，如果需要的话，也上演死亡。莫黛斯特的确在表演，只不过是孤身一人，表演着这爱情喜剧。她想象自己在社会生活的许多阶段，如愿以偿地被人爱慕。有时候，作为一个黑色传奇故事的女主角，她爱上了一个侩子手，或是一个在绞刑台上结束性命的可怜虫，或者，像她姐姐那样，爱上一个在阁楼里辛苦度日、身无分文的巴黎小伙子。有时候，她把自己想象成尼农，流连于各种游乐会，对男人们嗤之以鼻。有时，她又会把自己想象成某个博得满堂彩的女演员，或者是无忧无虑的女冒险家。她乐此不疲地亲身体验吉尔·布拉斯的幸运，或是帕斯塔、马利布朗以及弗洛丽纳的伟大成就。后来，当她厌倦了那些恐惧和兴奋之后，便又回到了现实生活当中。她想象自己跟一个公证人结了婚，每天吃着靠正当收入挣来的淡然无味的黑面包。她想象自己成了拉图奈尔夫人那样的人，接受了一种艰苦的生活，忍受着所有发财致富所必经的考验。然后，她又回到浪漫之中去，一个法国贵族的儿子，一个性格古怪、富有艺术气息的年轻人因为她的美貌而爱上了她。这位年轻人猜透了她的心思，认出了像斯塔尔夫人般的天才在她眉宇间点上的福星。后来，她的父亲回来了，腰缠万贯。经过父亲的允许，她让她的不同追求者经受某些考验（她总是小心地保持着自己的独立性）。她拥有一座华丽的庄园，还有城堡、仆人、马匹、马车，凡是奢华生活中最上等的东西，都应有尽有。而且她还要让她的追求者一直捉摸不透，直到四十岁的时候才作出决定。","To this period of Modeste’s eager rage for reading succeeded the exercise of a strange faculty given to vigorous imaginations,—the power, namely, of making herself an actor in a dream-existence; of representing to her own mind the things desired, with so vivid a conception that they seemed actually to attain reality; in short, to enjoy by thought,—to live out her years within her mind; to marry; to grow old; to attend her own funeral like Charles V.; to play within herself the comedy of life and, if need be, that of death.Modeste was indeed playing, but all alone, the comedy of Love.She fancied herself adored to the summit of her wishes in many an imagined phase of social life.Sometimes as the heroine of a dark romance, she loved the executioner, or the wretch who ended her days upon the scaffold, or, like her sister, some Parisian youth without a penny, whose struggles were all beneath a garret-roof.Sometimes she was Ninon, scorning men amid continual fetes; or some applauded actress, or gay adventuress, exhausting in her own behalf the luck of Gil Blas, or the triumphs of Pasta, Malibran, and Florine.Then, weary of the horrors and excitements, she returned to actual life.She married a notary, she ate the plain brown bread of honest everyday life, she saw herself a Madame Latournelle; she accepted a painful existence, she bore all the trials of a struggle with fortune.After that she went back to the romances: she was loved for her beauty; a son of a peer of France, an eccentric, artistic young man, divined her heart, recognized the star which the genius of a De Stael had planted on her brow.Her father returned, possessing millions.With his permission, she put her various lovers to certain tests (always carefully guarding her own independence); she owned a magnificent estate and castle, servants, horses, carriages, the choicest of everything that luxury could bestow, and kept her suitors uncertain until she was forty years old, at which age she made her choice."
"这独一无二的《一千零一夜》般的故事差不多持续了一年，教会了莫黛斯特从幻想中得到满足。她将自己的生活排演了太多次，太多次，她像个严肃的哲人般，满怀辛酸地问自己：“唉，生活到底是什么呢？”。所有的天才在通过大量从事他们所致力于的工作来结束那工作时，都会有这样的感觉。要不是莫黛斯特青春年少，又生性高贵，这时恐怕早已想着进修道院了。但这种满足感，让深谙天主教精神的她一头扑进了上帝的怀抱，扎进了广大无边的爱的天堂。她设想将慈善事业、为人服务作为她生活的真正事业。可她又像花萼底部的一条虫子，在忧郁沮丧中蜷缩成一团，无法为隐藏在内心的幻想找到食粮。此时，她静静地坐在那里，为穷人家的孩子缝制衣服，心不在焉地听着拉图奈尔先生喃喃地抱怨迪迈抓到了“第十三张牌”，或者抽走了他最后的王牌。","This edition of the Arabian Nights in a single copy lasted nearly a year, and taught Modeste the sense of satiety through thought.She held her life too often in her hand, she said to herself philosophically and with too real a bitterness, too seriously, and too often, “Well, what is it, after all?” not to have plunged to her waist in the deep disgust which all men of genius feel when they try to complete by intense toil the work to which they have devoted themselves.Her youth and her rich nature alone kept Modeste at this period of her life from seeking to enter a cloister.But this sense of satiety cast her, saturated as she still was with Catholic spirituality, into the love of Good, the infinite of heaven.She conceived of charity, service to others, as the true occupation of life; but she cowered in the gloomy dreariness of finding in it no food for the fancy that lay crouching in her heart like an insect at the bottom of a calyx.Meanwhile she sat tranquilly sewing garments for the children of the poor, and listening abstractedly to the grumblings of Monsieur Latournelle when Dumay held the thirteenth card or drew out his last trump."
"莫黛斯特的宗教信仰曾一度带给她一种与众不同的思考方式。她想象自己如果是无罪的（从教规上来讲），便能达到一种神圣的境界，上帝便会倾听她的心声，实现她的愿望。“信仰可以移山，”她想，“耶稣是这样说过的。救世主将他的信徒带到了太巴列湖上，而我，只请求主赐予我一个爱我的丈夫，那要比在海上行走容易得多。”她在下一个四旬斋节期间严守斋戒，没犯任何过错。于是她对自己说道，有一天当她走出教堂的时候，她会碰到一位与她般配的帅小伙，她的母亲会接受他，而他会疯狂地爱上她。就在她期望主给她派来一位天使的那天，她却被一个恶心的乞丐穷追不舍，而且那天还大雨滂沱，街上一个年轻男子都没有。还有一次，她到码头去散步，看到一群英国游客上岸来。但每个英国男人都带着一个英国女人，几乎跟莫黛斯特一样漂亮，她根本找不到任何一个恰尔德·哈罗德那样的浪子。她像马略那样坐在自己幻想的废墟上，泪流满面。但是，当她第三次召唤上帝的那一天，她深信自己的梦中情人就在教堂里，或许他是由于矜持，藏在某根柱子的后面。于是她拽着拉图奈尔夫人，绕着每根柱子都查了一遍。这次失败之后，她便不再相信神的无限威力了。她常常跟那位想象中的情人对话，为他编造出问题和答案，赋予他许多才能和智慧。","Her religious faith drove Modeste for a time into a singular track of thought.She imagined that if she became sinless (speaking ecclesiastically) she would attain to such a condition of sanctity that God would hear her and accomplish her desires.“Faith,” she thought, “can move mountains; Christ has said so.The Saviour led his apostle upon the waters of the lake Tiberias; and I, all I ask of God is a husband to love me; that is easier than walking upon the sea.”She fasted through the next Lent, and did not commit a single sin; then she said to herself that on a certain day coming out of church she should meet a handsome young man who was worthy of her, whom her mother would accept, and who would fall madly in love with her.When the day came on which she had, as it were, summoned God to send her an angel, she was persistently followed by a rather disgusting beggar; moreover, it rained heavily, and not a single young man was in the streets.On another occasion she went to walk on the jetty to see the English travellers land; but each Englishman had an Englishwoman, nearly as handsome as Modeste herself, who saw no one at all resembling a wandering Childe Harold.Tears overcame her, as she sat down like Marius on the ruins of her imagination.But on the day when she subpoenaed God for the third time she firmly believed that the Elect of her dreams was within the church, hiding, perhaps out of delicacy, behind one of the pillars, round all of which she dragged Madame Latournelle on a tour of inspection.After this failure, she deposed the Deity from omnipotence.Many were her conversations with the imaginary lover, for whom she invented questions and answers, bestowing upon him a great deal of wit and intelligence."
"这些浪漫故事的背后，藏着她那颗志向远大的心。正因为如此，她才规规矩矩的，让那些监视她的善良人赞叹不已。他们大可以介绍一些阿尔图家族或维尔坎家族的年轻小伙给她认识，而她绝不会屈尊于这些小丑。一言以蔽之，她就是想要一个天才的男人——一般的才华她是看不上的，就像对一个想要嫁给大使的女孩来说，一个律师就算不上什么了。她对财富的唯一欲望，就是把它扔到自己偶像的脚下。的确，这些可见事物的金色背景，远不如她那细腻的女性内心所蕴藏的珍宝那样丰富，因为那颗心的主要愿望是要让一位像塔索、弥尔顿、让-雅克·卢梭、缪拉、或克里斯托弗·哥伦布那样的天才快乐。","The high ambitions of her heart hidden within these romances were the real explanation of the prudent conduct which the good people who watched over Modeste so much admired; they might have brought her any number of young Althors or Vilquins, and she would never have stooped to such clowns.She wanted, purely and simply, a man of genius,—talent she cared little for; just as a lawyer is of no account to a girl who aims for an ambassador.Her only desire for wealth was to cast it at the feet of her idol.Indeed, the golden background of these visions was far less rich than the treasury of her own heart, filled with womanly delicacy; for its dominant desire was to make some Tasso, some Milton, a Jean–Jacques Rousseau, a Murat, a Christopher Columbus happy."
"平常的不幸是无法深深打动这颗年轻的心灵的，她期待着扑灭那些生前被人们忽视和否定的殉难者身上的烈火。有时候，她想象着用麦加香膏和柔和的曲调，或许能安抚卢梭愤世嫉俗的心灵。或者，她会把自己想象成拜伦爵士的妻子，凭直觉猜到他对现实的鄙视。她让自己像曼弗雷德的诗一样出色，并通过让他成为一名天主教徒来对付他的怀疑论。莫黛斯特还把莫里哀的忧郁归咎于十七世纪的女人。“每个才华横溢的男人身旁，”她问自己，“为什么就没有一个多情、美丽、富有的女子，心甘情愿地做他的奴隶，就像神秘的侍从莱拉那样？”读者们可以看到，她已完全理解了这位英国诗人（即拜伦）通过他的古勒奈尔之口所吟颂的“il pianto”（意大利语：眼泪）。莫黛斯特十分欣赏那位主动向小克雷比永求爱、并嫁给他的英国少女的行为。斯特恩和伊莱扎·德雷珀的故事曾在几个月里成为她的生活和快乐。她将自己想象成一个类似的爱情故事中的女主角，多次在脑海中扮演着伊莱扎这一伟大角色。那封令人欣喜的信中所表现出的敏感多情是如此迷人，令她热泪盈眶。据说，那些最机智的英国作家是不会为此流泪的。","Commonplace miseries did not seriously touch this youthful soul, who longed to extinguish the fires of the martyrs ignored and rejected in their own day.Sometimes she imagined balms of Gilead, soothing melodies which might have allayed the savage misanthropy of Rousseau.Or she fancied herself the wife of Lord Byron; guessing intuitively his contempt for the real, she made herself as fantastic as the poetry of Manfred, and provided for his scepticism by making him a Catholic.Modeste attributed Moliere’s melancholy to the women of the seventeenth century.“Why is there not some one woman,” she asked herself, “loving, beautiful, and rich, ready to stand beside each man of genius and be his slave, like Lara, the mysterious page?”She had, as the reader perceives, fully understood “il pianto,” which the English poet chanted by the mouth of his Gulmare.Modeste greatly admired the behavior of the young Englishwoman who offered herself to Crebillon, the son, who married her.The story of Sterne and Eliza Draper was her life and her happiness for several months.She made herself ideally the heroine of a like romance, and many a time she rehearsed in imagination the sublime role of Eliza.The sensibility so charmingly expressed in that delightful correspondence filled her eyes with tears which, it is said, were lacking in those of the wittiest of English writers."
"有一段时间，莫黛斯特不仅用心揣摩文学作品，还用心揣摩她喜爱的作家的性格——哥尔德斯密斯，也就是《奥伯曼》的作者，还有夏尔·诺迪埃和马图林。这成了她生活的全部。其中那些最可怜、受苦最深的作家就如同她的神灵，她猜测着他们经受的磨难，想象自己投身到那种孕育着天才思想的贫穷中去，并把自己心爱的宝物倾囊拿出。这些为自身才华殉道的伟大男人们，她想象着能给他们物质上的安慰。这种高贵的怜悯，这种对辛苦工作者拼搏的直觉感知，这种对天才的崇拜，是萦绕于女人心灵中最高尚的想法。首先，它们是这个女人同上帝之间的秘密，因为它们是隐藏着的，它们本身没有任何引人注目之处，也不能满足任何虚荣——而虚荣正是法国人一切行为的巨大动力。","Modeste existed for some time on a comprehension, not only of the works, but of the characters of her favorite authors,—Goldsmith, the author of Obermann, Charles Nodier, Maturin.The poorest and the most suffering among them were her deities; she guessed their trials, initiated herself into a destitution where the thoughts of genius brooded, and poured upon it the treasures of her heart; she fancied herself the giver of material comfort to these great men, martyrs to their own faculty.This noble compassion, this intuition of the struggles of toilers, this worship of genius, are among the choicest perceptions that flutter through the souls of women.They are, in the first place, a secret between the woman and God, for they are hidden; in them there is nothing striking, nothing that gratifies the vanity,—that powerful auxiliary to all action among the French."
"在她思想发展的第三个阶段，莫黛斯特有了一种强烈的欲望，她想要进入这些非凡之人中的一位的内心，去了解他的思想运作和天才的隐痛，不仅要弄明白他需要什么，还要弄明白他是什么。就在我们开始讲这个故事的时候，莫黛斯特的所有奇思妙想，她心灵的虚空之旅，对未知未来的探索，对生活的高贵态度，宁可在高雅环境中受苦、也不愿像她母亲那样在乡野生活的泥沼中挣扎的决心，还有她永不言败的誓言，捍卫父亲的家族荣誉、给全家带来欢乐——她内心世界的全部情感终于到达了顶点，找到了依托。莫黛斯特希望与这样一位男子为伴：他得是一位诗人，一位艺术家，在某个方面要超出常人。但她想自己选择这个人，并下定决心，只有在她细心考察、深入了解他之后，才能将自己的心、自己的生命、自己从情感束缚中迸发出来的无限柔情交给他。","Out of this third period of the development of her ideas, there came to Modeste a passionate desire to penetrate to the heart of one of these abnormal beings; to understand the working of the thoughts and the hidden griefs of genius,—to know not only what it wanted but what it was.At the period when this story begins, these vagaries of fancy, these excursions of her soul into the void, these feelers put forth into the darkness of the future, the impatience of an ungiven love to find its goal, the nobility of all her thoughts of life, the decision of her mind to suffer in a sphere of higher things rather than flounder in the marshes of provincial life like her mother, the pledge she had made to herself never to fail in conduct, but to respect her father’s hearth and bring it happiness,—all this world of feeling and sentiment had lately come to a climax and taken shape.Modeste wished to be the friend and companion of a poet, an artist, a man in some way superior to the crowd of men.But she intended to choose him,—not to give him her heart, her life, her infinite tenderness freed from the trammels of passion, until she had carefully and deeply studied him."
"这美妙的浪漫故事，她从一开始便乐在其中。她的心灵被深深的静谧笼罩了。她的脸颊呈现出柔和的粉嫩，她变成了一位美丽而高贵的德国女人，就像诸位近来看到的那样。她是木屋的荣耀，是拉图奈尔夫人和迪迈一家的骄傲。莫黛斯特正过着一种双重生活。她谦卑恭顺、一心一意地打理着木屋里的一切生活琐事，以它们为缰绳，来引导她那充满诗意的理想生活。就像加尔都西会的隐修修士，他们有条不紊地为物质生活而辛勤劳动，从而让心灵在祈祷中自由驰骋。所有伟大的思想者，都会将自己束缚于某种机械的艰苦劳动，以更好地驾驭思想。斯宾诺莎曾磨过玻璃镜片，贝尔曾数过房顶上的瓦片，孟德斯鸠曾从事园艺。这样，身体被束缚住了，心灵就能安全地展翅翱翔了。","She began this pretty romance by simply enjoying it.Profound tranquillity settled down upon her soul.Her cheeks took on a soft color; and she became the beautiful and noble image of Germany, such as we have lately seen her, the glory of the Chalet, the pride of Madame Latournelle and the Dumays.Modeste was living a double existence.She performed with humble, loving care all the minute duties of the homely life at the Chalet, using them as a rein to guide the poetry of her ideal life, like the Carthusian monks who labor methodically on material things to leave their souls the freer to develop in prayer.All great minds have bound themselves to some form of mechanical toil to obtain greater mastery of thought.Spinosa ground glasses for spectacles; Bayle counted the tiles on the roof; Montesquieu gardened.The body being thus subdued, the soul could spread its wings in all security."
"因此，米尼翁夫人是正确的，她读懂了女儿的心思。莫黛斯特恋爱了，她的爱是那种罕见的、很少被人理解的柏拉图式的爱情，这是一位少女最初的幻想，是所有情感中最为微妙的，是她内心的珍宝。她用未知的、模糊的、梦幻的圣杯开怀畅饮。她赞美那远在少女天堂里歌唱的青鸟的羽毛，那鸟儿可望而不可即，它掠过人们的视野，却没有枪能够打到。她喜爱那些魔幻般的色彩，那色彩仿佛闪闪发光的宝石，令人眼花缭乱，年轻人可以看到这一切，而当现实——那可怕的女巫，在市长和证人的陪同下出现时，他们就再也看不到了。生活在充满诗意的爱恋中，而又不见其情人——啊，多么甜美的陶醉！这是怎样的充满幻想的狂喜！一个关于飞翔的男子和展开的翅膀的幻想！","Madame Mignon, reading her daughter’s soul, was therefore right.Modeste loved; she loved with that rare platonic love, so little understood, the first illusion of a young girl, the most delicate of all sentiments, a very dainty of the heart.She drank deep draughts from the chalice of the unknown, the vague, the visionary.She admired the blue plumage of the bird that sings afar in the paradise of young girls, which no hand can touch, no gun can cover, as it flits across the sight; she loved those magic colors, like sparkling jewels dazzling to the eye, which youth can see, and never sees again when Reality, the hideous hag, appears with witnesses accompanied by the mayor.To live the very poetry of love and not to see the lover—ah, what sweet intoxication! what visionary rapture! a chimera with flowing man and outspread wings!"
"下面就是一件幼稚甚至是愚蠢的事情，它将决定这位年轻姑娘的未来生活。","The following is the puerile and even silly event which decided the future life of this young girl."
"在一家书店的陈列窗前，莫黛斯特碰巧看到了一幅她喜爱的卡那利的石印肖像。大家都知道这些画像多么不真实——它们是利用那些名人个性来做卑劣的投机生意的产物，仿佛那些名人的面孔是公共财产。","Modeste happened to see in a bookseller’s window a lithographic portrait of one of her favorites, Canalis.We all know what lies such pictures tell,—being as they are the result of a shameless speculation, which seizes upon the personality of celebrated individuals as if their faces were public property."
"在这幅素描画里，卡那利摆出一副拜伦式的姿态，让公众欣赏他那风中飘扬的黑发、裸露的脖颈，还有那每位吟游诗人都应有的深不可测的额头。维克多·雨果的额头让多少效仿者剃光了头，其数量比为拿破仑的荣誉战死沙场的早期元帅还要多。这幅卡那利画像（出于商业需要而显得富有诗意）吸引了莫黛斯特的目光。就在这一天，她注意到阿尔泰兹的一本最好的书也碰巧出版了。尽管这样说可能有损莫黛斯特的形象，我们还是不得不承认她在这位著名诗人和这位著名散文家之间犹豫了很久。这两位名人谁还是单身呢？——这正是问题所在。","In this instance Canalis, sketched in a Byronic pose, was offering to public admiration his dark locks floating in the breeze, a bare throat, and the unfathomable brow which every bard ought to possess.Victor Hugo’s forehead will make more persons shave their heads than the number of incipient marshals ever killed by the glory of Napoleon.This portrait of Canalis (poetic through mercantile necessity) caught Modeste’s eye.The day on which it caught her eye one of Arthez’s best books happened to be published.We are compelled to admit, though it may be to Modeste’s injury, that she hesitated long between the illustrious poet and the illustrious prose-writer.Which of these celebrated men was free?—that was the question."
"莫黛斯特开始同弗朗索瓦丝·科歇进行合作。她是可怜的贝蒂娜从勒阿弗尔带走、又带回来的一个仆人，现在，她受雇于米尼翁夫人和迪迈夫人，按天领工钱，就住在勒阿弗尔。莫黛斯特把她带到自己的房间里，向她保证自己永远都不会给父母带来任何伤痛，永远都不会越过一位少女行为规范的底线，而弗朗索瓦丝本人也将在米尼翁先生回来后过上优越的生活——条件是弗朗索瓦丝要为她做一件事，并严格保守秘密。到底是什么事呢？嗨，是一件小事——绝对无害于他人的小事。莫黛斯特要她的同伙做的事情，就是把一些信件投到勒阿弗尔的邮筒里，然后再拿回一些寄到弗朗索瓦丝·科歇名下的信件。协议达成了，莫黛斯特便给卡那利诗歌的出版商多里亚写了一封客气而简短的信，她抱着对那位伟大诗人的兴趣，向他询问了一些有关卡那利的细节，其中就包括他是否已经结婚。她请求出版商将答案以“留局待取”的形式寄给勒阿弗尔的弗朗索瓦丝小姐。","Modeste began by securing the co-operation of Francoise Cochet, a maid taken from Havre and brought back again by poor Bettina, whom Madame Mignon and Madame Dumay now employed by the day, and who lived in Havre.Modeste took her to her own room and assured her that she would never cause her parents any grief, never pass the bounds of a young girl’s propriety, and that as to Francoise herself she would be well provided for after the return of Monsieur Mignon, on condition that she would do a certain service and keep it an inviolable secret.What was it?Why, a nothing—perfectly innocent.All that Modeste wanted of her accomplice was to put certain letters into the post at Havre and to bring some back which would be directed to herself, Francoise Cochet.The treaty concluded, Modeste wrote a polite note to Dauriat, publisher of the poems of Canalis, asking, in the interest of that great poet, for some particulars about him, among others if he were married.She requested the publisher to address his answer to Mademoiselle Francoise, “poste restante,” Havre."
"多里亚哪里会认真对待这封信，他和当时碰巧在办公室的四五个记者一起写了封回信，每个人都加上了一句自己的俏皮话。","Dauriat, incapable of taking the epistle seriously, wrote a reply in presence of four or five journalists who happened to be in his office at the time, each of whom added his particular stroke of wit to the production."
"小姐：康斯坦·西尔·梅尔基奥尔·德卡那利男爵，法兰西学院成员，一八零零年出生于科雷兹的卡那利，身高五尺四寸、声望良好、接种过牛痘、出身清白、服过兵役、身体十分健康，在科雷兹有一小块祖传的地产，想结婚，但女方必须富有。","Mademoiselle,—Canalis (Baron of), Constant Cys Melchior, member of the French Academy, born in 1800, at Canalis (Correze), five feet four inches in height, of good standing, vaccinated, spotless birth, has given a substitute to the conscription, enjoys perfect health, owns a small patrimonial estate in the Correze, and wishes to marry, but the lady must be rich."
"他的盾形族徽由一条直线一分为二，一边为直纹红色，上有一把金色战斧，一边为黑色，上有三个银色贝壳，顶部是男爵花环，底部是两株绿色的落叶松。他家族的铭言是“金和铁”（不过和俄斐或其他黄金产地没什么关联）。","He beareth per pale, gules an axe or, sable three escallops argent, surmounted by a baron’s coronet; supporters, two larches, vert.Motto: “Or et fer” (no allusion to Ophir or auriferous)."
"第一位卡那利族人跟随第一批十字军去了圣地，这在奥弗涅编年史中有记载，由于家境贫穷，当时他身上只有一把斧头。而时至今日，贫穷的命运仍重重地压在这个家族身上。这位贵族男爵因打败了大量的异教徒而出名，最后，在当时还没有救护车的情况下，死于耶路撒冷附近的阿什凯隆平原。他死时身上没有金也没有铁，就像一只蠕虫那样一文不名。","The original Canalis, who went to the Holy Land with the First Crusade, is cited in the chronicles of Auvergne as being armed with an axe on account of the family indigence, which to this day weighs heavily on the race.This noble baron, famous for discomfiting a vast number of infidels, died, without “or” or “fer,” as naked as a worm, near Jerusalem, on the plains of Ascalon, ambulances not being then invented."
"卡那利古堡（周围的地区生长着一些栗树）由两座废塔组成，一段长满了常春藤的围墙将这两座塔连接了起来。古堡每年要交二十二法郎的税款。","The chateau of Canalis (the domain yields a few chestnuts) consists of two dismantled towers, united by a piece of wall covered by a fine ivy, and is taxed at twenty-two francs."
"信末署名者（出版商）还强调，德卡那利先生的每一卷诗集都是自己花一万法郎买来的，卡那利不会把他的贝壳或坚果白送给别人。","The undersigned (publisher) calls attention to the fact that he pays ten thousand francs for every volume of poetry written by Monsieur de Canalis, who does not give his shells, or his nuts either, for nothing."
"这位科雷兹的抒情诗人现住在天堂-鱼贩子街二十九号，这对于一位天使派诗人来说，是一个十分合适的地方。他的信件的邮资都是已付的。","The chanticler of the Correze lives in the rue de Paradis-Poissoniere, number 29, which is a highly suitable location for a poet of the angelic school.Letters must be post-paid."
"据说，圣日耳曼郊区的贵妇们经常走到天堂街去保护她们心中的神。国王查理十世对这位伟大的诗人评价很高，以至于相信他能够治理国家；最近，国王任命他为荣誉军团的长官，还有外交部行政法院主席（这一职位收入更多）。这些职位都没有妨碍这位伟大的天才从鼓励艺术和文学的基金中得到一份津贴。","Noble dames of the faubourg Saint-Germain are said to take the path to Paradise and protect its god.The king, Charles X., thinks so highly of this great poet as to believe him capable of governing the country; he has lately made him officer of the Legion of honor, and (what pays him better) president of the court of Claims at the foreign office.These functions do not hinder this great genius from drawing an annuity out of the fund for the encouragement of the arts and belles letters."
"卡那利作品的最新版由迪多出版社用精致的羊皮纸印刷，规格为253mm×158mm，书中有比西欧、约瑟夫·布里多、西奈尔、索麦维尔等人绘制的插图，一共五卷，定价九法郎，包括邮资。","The last edition of the works of Canalis, printed on vellum, royal 8vo, from the press of Didot, with illustrations by Bixiou, Joseph Bridau, Schinner, Sommervieux, etc., is in five volumes, price, nine francs post-paid."
"这封信就像一块砸在郁金香上的鹅卵石。一位诗人、行政法院主席，领着公职的薪水，还有津贴，戴着勋章，受到圣日耳曼郊区女人的爱慕——可游吟诗人不应该是带着满身泥泞徘徊于码头，心里充斥着悲伤和幻想，被工作压得喘不过气、而又装着满脑子的诗歌回到自己的阁楼上吗？然而，莫黛斯特看出来了那位满怀嫉妒的出版商的冷嘲热讽，他竟敢说：“我造就了卡那利，我造就了拿单！”另外，她重温了她偶像的诗歌——那些诗篇是那么地富有魅力、虚幻而伪善，就算只是为了解释莫黛斯特的这种迷恋，我们也有必要对这些诗篇稍作分析。","This letter fell like a cobble-stone on a tulip.A poet, secretary of claims, getting a stipend in a public office, drawing an annuity, seeking a decoration, adored by the women of the faubourg Saint–Germain—was that the muddy minstrel lingering along the quays, sad, dreamy, worn with toil, and re-entering his garret fraught with poetry?However, Modeste perceived the irony of the envious bookseller, who dared to say, “I invented Canalis; I made Nathan!”Besides, she re-read her hero’s poems,—verses extremely seductive, insincere, and hypocritical, which require a word of analysis, were it only to explain her infatuation."
"卡那利与天使派领袖拉马丁的不同在于，前者有一种甜言蜜语的强调，如同照顾病人的护士一般，有一种靠不住的温情，一种讨喜的精妙措辞。如果说这位大声呐喊的领袖是一只鹰的话，那卡那利就是一只红白相间的火烈鸟。他是女人们寻求的那种朋友，一个能够理解她们、向她们解释她们自己的阐释者，一个可靠的知己。莫黛斯特用铅笔在最新版中迪多留出的宽大页边空白处写满了自己的感想，表达着她与这颗充满柔情和幻想的心灵的共鸣。卡那利没有得到生命的馈赠，他无法赋予他的作品生命，但他知道怎样慰藉人们的隐痛，比如莫黛斯特的隐痛。他用少女们自己的语言同她们交谈，他能够减轻鲜血淋漓的伤口的剧痛，抚慰悲哀的呻吟，甚至是痛哭流涕。他的天赋不在于激昂的词句，也不在于抚慰那些沉重的情感创伤，他只是满足于用一种和谐悦耳的、令人信赖的语调说道：“你们的痛苦我感同身受，我能理解你们，跟我来吧，让我们到小溪边、到柳树下一起哭一场。”于是她们就随他而去了！她们倾听着他空洞而响亮的诗句，就像婴儿倾听着奶妈的摇篮曲一样。卡那利同诺迪埃一样，通过他的机智、他的微笑、他那凋落的玫瑰花瓣——简言之，就是通过他那婴儿般的哲学，令读者陶醉不已。只不过这种天真烂漫在散文家诺迪埃笔下十分真实，在诗人卡那利笔下却有些矫揉造作。他很善于模仿我们青春年少时的语言，将我们带回幻想中的大草原。我们可以无情地对待鹰，要求它们有钻石般的品质和不朽的完美，但对于卡那利，我们却能接受他本来的面目，至于其他的就随它去吧。他像是个乖小伙子，天使派的装腔作势已经解释了他的目的。他就像一个聪明的女人，装作天真无邪，装作无辜，装作大吃一惊，简言之，就是装作受伤的天使，而且伪装得非常成功。","Canalis may be distinguished from Lamartine, chief of the angelic school, by a wheedling tone like that of a sick-nurse, a treacherous sweetness, and a delightful correctness of diction.If the chief with his strident cry is an eagle, Canalis, rose and white, is a flamingo.In him women find the friend they seek, their interpreter, a being who understands them, who explains them to themselves, and a safe confidant.The wide margins given by Didot to the last edition were crowded with Modeste’s pencilled sentiments, expressing her sympathy with this tender and dreamy spirit.Canalis does not possess the gift of life; he cannot breathe existence into his creations; but he knows how to calm vague sufferings like those which assailed Modeste.He speaks to young girls in their own language; he can allay the anguish of a bleeding wound and lull the moans, even the sobs of woe.His gift lies not in stirring words, nor in the remedy of strong emotions, he contents himself with saying in harmonious tones which compel belief, “I suffer with you; I understand you; come with me; let us weep together beside the brook, beneath the willows.”And they follow him!They listen to his empty and sonorous poetry like infants to a nurse’s lullaby.Canalis, like Nodier, enchants the reader by an artlessness which is genuine in the prose writer and artificial in the poet, by his tact, his smile, the shedding of his rose-leaves, in short by his infantile philosophy.He imitates so well the language of our early youth that he leads us back to the prairie-land of our illusions.We can be pitiless to the eagles, requiring from them the quality of the diamond, incorruptible perfection; but as for Canalis, we take him for what he is and let the rest go.He seems a good fellow; the affectations of the angelic school have answered his purpose and succeeded, just as a woman succeeds when she plays the ingenue cleverly, and simulates surprise, youth, innocence betrayed, in short, the wounded angel."
"莫黛斯特找回了她的第一印象，重获了对那颗心灵、对那张像贝尔纳丹·德圣皮埃尔一样使人着迷的面孔的信任。她没有再理出版商了。于是，大约在八月初的时候，她给这颗现代七星诗社里的明星、圣器室里的多拉写了下面这封信。","Modeste, recovering her first impression, renewed her confidence in that soul, in that countenance as ravishing as the face of Bernardin de Saint-Pierre.She paid no further attention to the publisher.And so, about the beginning of the month of August she wrote the following letter to this Dorat of the sacristy, who still ranks as a star of the modern Pleiades."
"致德卡那利先生——先生，我曾多次想给您写信，为什么呢？您一定猜得到的——是为了告诉您我多么地崇拜您的才华。是的，我觉得我必须向您表达一位可怜的乡村女孩对您的倾慕，她独居一隅，唯一的快乐就是阅读您的作品。我读过勒内的作品，现在在读您的。忧伤让人沉湎于幻想。还有多少女人在向您传递她们内心神秘的敬仰之情呢？在这么多人当中，我被注意到的几率又有多大呢？这封信满载着我的热情，与那些已经给您造成困扰的香喷喷的信件相比，希望我的信对您更有意义些。对您而言，我没有其他人那样优雅大方，因为我不想透露姓名，但我仍希望能得到您的完全信任，仿佛您与我相识已久。","To Monsieur de Canalis,—Many a time, monsieur, I have wished to write to you; and why?Surely you guess why,—to tell you how much I admire your genius.Yes, I feel the need of expressing to you the admiration of a poor country girl, lonely in her little corner, whose only happiness is to read your thoughts.I have read Rene, and I come to you.Sadness leads to reverie.How many other women are sending you the homage of their secret thoughts?What chance have I for notice among so many?This paper, filled with my soul,—can it be more to you than the perfumed letters which already beset you.I come to you with less grace than others, for I wish to remain unknown and yet to receive your entire confidence—as though you had long known me."
"请给我回信，并善待我吧。我不能许诺会让您知道我的姓名，尽管我并没有确切地说有一天我不会这样做。","Answer my letter and be friendly with me.I cannot promise to make myself known to you, though I do not positively say I will not some day do so."
"还有什么要补充的呢？先生，请从这封信的字里行间读出我所作出的巨大努力吧，请答应我，向我伸出您的手——一位朋友的手，啊！一位真正的朋友。","What shall I add?Read between the lines of this letter, monsieur, the great effort which I am making: permit me to offer you my hand,—that of a friend, ah! a true friend."
"您的仆人，欧·德埃斯特·莫","Your servant, O. d’Este M."
"附言——如果您愿意给我回信的话，请您将信以“留局待取”的形式寄给勒阿弗尔的弗·科歇小姐。","P.S.—If you do me the favor to answer this letter address your reply, if you please, to Mademoiselle F. Cochet, “poste restante,” Havre."
"第七章 一位天使派诗人","Chapter VII A Poet of the Angelic School"
"所有的少女，无论浪漫与否，都能想象到莫黛斯特在接下来几天里的焦躁不安。空气中充满了火热的语言。树木仿佛羽毛一般。她感觉不到自己的身体，她在空中漂浮着，脚下的土地渐渐融化。怀着对邮局的热爱，她一路追随她那张小小的信笺，她感到很幸福，就像二十岁的我们第一次按自己的意愿行事时那样幸福。她着魔了，就像中世纪传说里的少女那样。她在脑海里勾勒出这位诗人的住所，他的书房，她看到他打开了自己写的信，然后便是她的种种假设。","All young girls, romantic or otherwise, can imagine the impatience in which Modeste lived for the next few days.The air was full of tongues of fire.The trees were like a plumage.She was not conscious of a body; she hovered in space, the earth melted away under her feet.Full of admiration for the post-office, she followed her little sheet of paper on its way; she was happy, as we all are happy at twenty years of age, in the first exercise of our will.She was possessed, as in the middle ages.She made pictures in her mind of the poet’s abode, of his study; she saw him unsealing her letter; and then followed myriads of suppositions."
"一番诗情画意之后，我们有必要对这位诗人稍作介绍。卡那利矮小清瘦，颇具贵族气质，面如满月，脸色较黑，头很小，就像那些虚荣多于骄傲的人一样。他喜欢奢华、地位和排场。跟大部分人相比，钱对他来说更为重要。他对自己出身的自豪感甚至超过了对其才华的自豪感。如今，由于他过分夸耀他的祖先们，他们的价值已遭到了破坏——毕竟，卡那利家族不是纳瓦兰家族，不是卡迪央家族，也不是葛朗利厄家族。然而，他的自命不凡是天性使然。他拥有一双颇具东方气息、炯炯有神的眼睛，这是诗人所应具备的，他的举止也很文雅，声音洪亮。然而，他那招摇撞骗的天性几乎毁了所有这些优点，他天生就是个喜剧演员。如果他露出他的匀称的双脚，那是因为这一姿势已经成了他的习惯；如果他使用感叹词，那是因为那已成了他的一部分；如果他举止夸张、引人注目，那是因为他已经将这种行为变成了他的第二天性。这些缺点与他总体的仁慈作风及游侠精神相得益彰，而正是这种纯粹的、理想化的精神，将游侠骑士与普通骑士区分开来。卡那利没有足够的热情成为堂吉诃德，但他的思想过于崇高，在碰到一些问题和事情时，总是表现得比别人更高尚。他抓住一切有利可图的机会，让他的诗歌像暴风雨般地席卷全镇，这确实有损于他的诗人形象，因为他并不是没有头脑，而是他的才华阻碍了他发挥其智慧。他过分重视自己的名声，总想让自己看上去比实际更伟大。于是，正如我们常见的那样，他本人与他的思想产物完全不一致。这些天真纯朴、抚慰人心、充满柔情的抒情诗，这些犹如湖面一样纯净、平和、宁静的田园诗，这些如此具有女性特点的诗歌，它们的作者却是一个小小的野心家。他身穿一身纽扣紧扣的礼服，浑身散发出一种寻求政治权势的外交官气度，极具贵族气质，自命不凡，渴望金钱，沉溺于两方面的成就之中，戴着爱神木和月桂树的双重花环。政府职务的八千法郎薪俸，文学基金的三千法郎津贴，法兰西学院的两千法郎，还有祖传地产的三千法郎（扣除税款以及管理费之前）——他每年共有一万五千法郎的固定收入，再加上他的诗作，不管年头好坏，总有一万法郎的收入，总计两万五千法郎。然而，这笔收入对莫黛斯特心目中的英雄来说，却太不稳定、太不够花了，他每年一般要多花出五六千法郎。不过迄今为止，国王的个人金库和外交部的秘密基金已经补足了这些亏空。他为国王的加冕礼作了一首赞美诗，为此他得到了一整套银器，因为他拒绝拿赏钱，理由是卡那利家族成员有义务为国王效力。","After sketching the poetry we cannot do less than give the profile of the poet.Canalis is a short, spare man, with an air of good-breeding, a dark-complexioned, moon-shaped face, and a rather mean head like that of a man who has more vanity than pride.He loves luxury, rank, and splendor.Money is of more importance to him than to most men.Proud of his birth, even more than of his talent, he destroys the value of his ancestors by making too much of them in the present day,—after all, the Canalis are not Navarreins, nor Cadignans, nor Grandlieus.Nature, however, helps him out in his pretensions.He has those eyes of Eastern effulgence which we demand in a poet, a delicate charm of manner, and a vibrant voice; yet a taint of natural charlatanism destroys the effect of nearly all these advantages; he is a born comedian.If he puts forward his well-shaped foot, it is because the attitude has become a habit; if he uses exclamatory terms they are part of himself; if he poses with high dramatic action he has made that deportment his second nature.Such defects as these are not incompatible with a general benevolence and a certain quality of errant and purely ideal chivalry, which distinguishes the paladin from the knight.Canalis has not devotion enough for a Don Quixote, but he has too much elevation of thought not to put himself on the nobler side of questions and things.His poetry, which takes the town by storm on all profitable occasions, really injures the man as a poet; for he is not without mind, but his talent prevents him from developing it; he is overweighted by his reputation, and is always aiming to make himself appear greater than he has the credit of being.Thus, as often happens, the man is entirely out of keeping with the products of his thought.The author of these naive, caressing, tender little lyrics, these calm idylls pure and cold as the surface of a lake, these verses so essentially feminine, is an ambitious little creature in a tightly buttoned frock-coat, with the air of a diplomat seeking political influence, smelling of the musk of aristocracy, full of pretension, thirsting for money, already spoiled by success in two directions, and wearing the double wreath of myrtle and of laurel.A government situation worth eight thousand francs, three thousand francs’ annuity from the literary fund, two thousand from the Academy, three thousand more from the paternal estate (less the taxes and the cost of keeping it in order),—a total fixed income of fifteen thousand francs, plus the ten thousand bought in, one year with another, by his poetry; in all twenty-five thousand francs,—this for Modeste’s hero was so precarious and insufficient an income that he usually spent five or six thousand francs more every year; but the king’s privy purse and the secret funds of the foreign office had hitherto supplied the deficit.He wrote a hymn for the king’s coronation which earned him a whole silver service,—having refused a sum of money on the ground that a Canalis owed his duty to his sovereign."
"但此时，按照记者们的说法，卡那利已经江郎才尽了。他感觉自己不能创作出任何新形式的诗歌，他的七弦竖琴没有七根弦，只有一根，而且用那一根弹得太久了，听众不允许他有其他的选择，他要么就把自己吊在这根弦上，要么就闭上他的嘴巴。德马尔赛不喜欢卡那利，他对卡那利的评价如有毒的箭头，刺中了这位诗人虚荣的要害。“卡那利总是让我想起一位勇士，”他说道，“在一次战役之后，弗雷德里克大帝召唤并夸奖了他，因为他的军号从不间断地嘀嘀哒哒吹着同一个曲调。”卡那利的理想是从政，并把他的马德里之行作为开端。当时德肖利厄公爵正任大使，而他是大使秘书，可巴黎人都传言说他其实是为了追随公爵夫人。有多少次，一句讽刺或是一次谈话就能决定一个人的一生。前内高卢共和国总统、皮埃蒙特最好的律师科拉，在他四十岁时，一位朋友说他对植物学一窍不通。他的自尊心受了伤害，当起了朱西厄第二，种植花草，并花十年的时间编辑出版了拉丁文著作《皮埃蒙特植物志》。“总有一天我要让德马尔赛拜我为师！”这位挫败的诗人想道，“毕竟，坎宁和夏多布里昂都是从政的。”","But about this time Canalis had, as the journalists say, exhausted his budget.He felt himself unable to invent any new form of poetry; his lyre did not have seven strings, it had one; and having played on that one string so long, the public allowed him no other alternative but to hang himself with it, or to hold his tongue.De Marsay, who did not like Canalis, made a remark whose poisoned shaft touched the poet to the quick of his vanity.“Canalis,” he said, “always reminds me of that brave man whom Frederic the Great called up and commended after a battle because his trumpet had never ceased tooting its one little tune.”Canalis’s ambition was to enter political life, and he made capital of a journey he had taken to Madrid as secretary to the embassy of the Duc de Chaulieu, though it was really made, according to Parisian gossip, in the capacity of “attache to the duchess.”How many times a sarcasm or a single speech has decided the whole course of a man’s life.Colla, the late president of the Cisalpine republic, and the best lawyer in Piedmont, was told by a friend when he was forty years of age that he knew nothing of botany.He was piqued, became a second Jussieu, cultivated flowers, and compiled and published “The Flora of Piedmont,” in Latin, a labor of ten years.“I’ll master De Marsay some of these days!” thought the crushed poet; “after all, Canning and Chateaubriand are both in politics.”"
"卡那利本想写一部伟大的政治诗作，但他还是害怕法国的出版社，它们对任何一位用四行亚历山大诗表达思想的作家，都会予以严厉批评。当今的所有诗人当中，只有雨果、泰奥菲勒·戈蒂埃和德维尼三个人赢得了诗人和散文家的双重荣誉，就像拉辛、伏尔泰、莫里哀和拉伯雷一样——这在法国文学中是一种罕见的盛名，获得它的人有权利享有诗人的最高头衔。","Canalis would gladly have brought forth some great political poem, but he was afraid of the French press, whose criticisms are savage upon any writer who takes four alexandrines to express one idea.Of all the poets of our day only three, Hugo, Theophile Gautier, and De Vigny, have been able to win the double glory of poet and prose-writer, like Racine and Voltaire, Moliere, and Rabelais,—a rare distinction in the literature of France, which ought to give a man a right to the crowning title of poet."
"所以，这位圣日耳曼郊区的诗人努力将自己的小马车置于当今政府的保护伞下，此乃明智之举。当他成为外交部行政法院主席后，需要一位秘书——一位能够在很多情况下代替他、替他从出版商那里谋取利益、维护他在报纸上的名声、必要的时候在政治上帮助他的朋友——简言之，就是一个任他使唤的跟班。在巴黎，许多在艺术、科学和文学方面享有盛名的人都有一个或多个追捧者——也可以说是警卫队队长或管家。他们生活在名人的光辉下，这些担负着微妙使命的副官，在必要的情况下会拿自己的名誉拼一场。这些围着偶像做事的人不完全是他的仆人，然而也不能和他平起平坐，这些人英勇地保护着他，冲锋时在前，撤退时殿后，为他的事业忙碌着，而且只要他们的幻想尚存，或者尚未得到他们想要的一切，就会一直为他效忠。这些追随者当中，有些觉察出了他们的偶像的忘恩负义，另一些人感觉他们只是被利用的工具，还有许多人厌倦了这种生活。只有少数人仍满足于那种感觉和情感上的愉悦的对等，这是在与上级交往时所应追求的唯一回报——就像穆罕默德将阿里提升到与自己同等重要的位置时，阿里会收获一种满足感。","So then, the bard of the faubourg Saint–Germain was doing a wise thing in trying to house his little chariot under the protecting roof of the present government.When he became president of the court of Claims at the foreign office, he stood in need of a secretary,—a friend who could take his place in various ways; cook up his interests with publishers, see to his glory in the newspapers, help him if need be in politics,—in short, a cat’s paw and satellite.In Paris many men of celebrity in art, science, and literature have one or more train-bearers, captains of the guard, chamberlains as it were, who live in the sunshine of their presence,—aides-decamp entrusted with delicate missions, allowing themselves to be compromised if necessary; workers round the pedestal of the idol; not exactly his servants, nor yet his equals; bold in his defence, first in the breach, covering all retreats, busy with his business, and devoted to him just so long as their illusions last, or until the moment when they have got all they wanted.Some of these satellites perceive the ingratitude of their great man; others feel that they are simply made tools of; many weary of the life; very few remain contented with that sweet equality of feeling and sentiment which is the only reward that should be looked for in an intimacy with a superior man,—a reward that contented Ali when Mohammed raised him to himself."
"他们当中的许多人都被虚荣所误导，觉得自己跟主人一样有能耐。莫黛斯特所构想的那种不求金钱、千金难买的单纯的忠诚是极少见的。然而，确实也有麦讷瓦尔那样的人，这样的人在巴黎比在其他地方可能还要多些。他们珍视在幕后默默操劳的生活，他们就像社交界这座隐修院中的本笃会修士。这些勇敢、温顺的心灵，通过他们的行动，在他们隐修的一生中，过着诗人们所说的诗意生活。从心灵上来讲，从温情上来讲，从他们的独立坚守、冥思苦想上来讲，他们自己就是诗人——跟那些名字写在书上、在满是韵文的文学沃土中成长的人一样，是真正的诗人。他们就像拜伦勋爵，像那些，唉，由于没有更好的生路而靠墨水——当今世上的灵泉之水——谋生的人。","Many of these men, misled by vanity, think themselves quite as capable as their patron.Pure devotion, such as Modeste conceived it, without money and without price, and more especially without hope, is rare.Nevertheless there are Mennevals to be found, more perhaps in Paris than elsewhere, men who value a life in the background with its peaceful toil; these are the wandering Benedictines of our social world, which offers them no other monastery.These brave, meek hearts live, by their actions and in their hidden lives, the poetry that poets utter.They are poets themselves in soul, in tenderness, in their lonely vigils and meditations,—as truly poets as others of the name on paper, who fatten in the fields of literature at so much a verse; like Lord Byron, like all who live, alas, by ink, the Hippocrene water of today, for want of a better."
"一位行政法院的年轻律师，被卡那利的名气及政治前景所吸引，听从了按德肖利厄公爵夫人指示办事的德埃斯巴夫人的建议，成了这位诗人的秘书兼密友。诗人很乐意地接受了他，十分宠爱他，就像投机商爱抚他的第一个入股者一样。这种伙伴关系一开始很像友情。这个年轻人之前还跟一位内阁大臣有过同样的关系。那位大臣于一八二七年下台了，下台之前还细心地给他这位年轻秘书安排了外交部的一个职务。埃内斯特·德拉布里埃当时二十七岁，已经被授予荣誉军团勋章，但除了薪俸外没有其他收入。他很会办事，而且在首相内阁的四年当中学到了很多东西。他为人友善、和蔼、十分谦虚，内心淳朴，满怀美好的情感，不喜欢抛头露面。他热爱自己的国家，希望报效祖国，但恶名却令他困窘不堪。比起做内阁大臣的秘书，他更渴望做一位拿破仑式人物的秘书。他一成为卡那利的朋友兼秘书，便为卡那利做了很多事。但十八个月后，他便开始意识到，这个只在文学表达上富有诗意的人，其内心是极其荒芜的。俗话说得好：“穿上修道士服不一定能成修道士。”这一现象在文学界尤为突出。在文人中，天性跟才华完美结合的人是极其少见的。才华并不代表一个人本身。这种断裂现象令人惊异，其原因是一个未解的、甚至可能是无解的谜。大脑和大脑的各种产物（因为在艺术中，人的手就是其大脑的延续）相去甚远。各种产物在脑壳下开花结果，却完全独立于情感、感觉、公民美德、传统美德以及私人生活。此话固然不假，但也并非绝对。对一个人来说，没有什么是绝对正确的。可以肯定的是，浪荡子会磨灭自己的才华，酒鬼会浪费自己的才华。可反过来说，却没有人能够通过健康的生活方式来赋予自己才华。不过，我们差不多可以证明，爱情绘画大师维吉尔从没爱过狄东那样的女子，而模范公民卢梭，如果能过得像贵族一样，就会感到很自豪的。不过话又说回来，拉斐尔和米开朗琪罗就展示了天才和人格的完美结合。因此，从道义上来讲，才能之于男人，恰如美貌之于女人——不过是一种希冀罢了。所以，让我们加倍崇拜那些心灵和人格同其才能一样完美的人吧。","Attracted by the fame of Canalis, also by the prospect of political interest, and advised thereto by Madame d’Espard, who acted in the matter for the Duchesse de Chaulieu, a young lawyer of the court of Claims became secretary and confidential friend of the poet, who welcomed and petted him very much as a broker caresses his first dabbler in the funds.The beginning of this companionship bore a very fair resemblance to friendship.The young man had already held the same relation to a minister, who went out of office in 1827, taking care before he did so to appoint his young secretary to a place in the foreign office.Ernest de La Briere, then about twenty-seven years of age, was decorated with the Legion of honor but was without other means than his salary; he was accustomed to the management of business and had learned a good deal of life during his four years in a minister’s cabinet.Kindly, amiable, and over-modest, with a heart full of pure and sound feelings, he was averse to putting himself in the foreground.He loved his country, and wished to serve her, but notoriety abashed him.To him the place of secretary to a Napoleon was far more desirable than that of the minister himself.As soon as he became the friend and secretary of Canalis he did a great amount of labor for him, but by the end of eighteen months he had learned to understand the barrenness of a nature that was poetic through literary expression only.The truth of the old proverb, “The cowl doesn’t make the monk,” is eminently shown in literature.It is extremely rare to find among literary men a nature and a talent that are in perfect accord.The faculties are not the man himself.This disconnection, whose phenomena are amazing, proceeds from an unexplored, possibly an unexplorable mystery.The brain and its products of all kinds (for in art the hand of man is a continuation of his brain) are a world apart, which flourishes beneath the cranium in absolute independence of sentiments, feelings, and all that is called virtue, the virtue of citizens, fathers, and private life.This, however true, is not absolutely so; nothing is absolutely true of man.It is certain that a debauched man will dissipate his talent, that a drunkard will waste it in libations; while, on the other hand, no man can give himself talent by wholesome living: nevertheless, it is all but proved that Virgil, the painter of love, never loved a Dido, and that Rousseau, the model citizen, had enough pride to had furnished forth an aristocracy.On the other hand Raphael and Michael Angelo do present the glorious conjunction of genius with the lines of character.Talent in men is therefore, in all moral points, very much what beauty is in women,—simply a promise.Let us, therefore, doubly admire the man in whom both heart and character equal the perfection of his genius."
"当埃内斯特发现他的诗人有一种野心勃勃的利己主义、一种最坏的利己主义时（因为某些形式的利己主义还是挺讨人喜欢的），他便想要离开卡那利，却又有些踌躇不决。天性诚实的人很难挣脱束缚，特别是当他们自愿地被束缚时。于是，莫黛斯特的信寄来时，这位秘书还是跟这位诗人在同一个屋檐下和睦相处。一般说来，在这种关系里，秘书总要不断压抑自己的情感，不断自我牺牲。拉布里埃承认卡那利在他面前很坦诚，从不掩饰什么。再加上卡那利一生都被人们看作是一位伟大的诗人，像马蒙泰尔一样受人赞美，他的缺点只是他光辉品质的反面而已。如果他不爱慕虚荣、狂妄自大，那么他可能永远都无法练就那声如洪钟的雄辩术，而这种雄辩术在政治生活中非常有用，甚至是必不可少的工具。他的冷酷无情在某些方面近乎正直和忠诚，他的虚荣卖弄之中也带有一丝慷慨大方。我们必须记住，结果是要有益社会的，而出于什么动机，则只有上帝才管得着。","When Ernest discovered within his poet an ambitious egoist, the worst species of egoist (for there are some amiable forms of the vice), he felt a delicacy in leaving him.Honest natures cannot easily break the ties that bind them, especially if they have tied them voluntarily.The secretary was therefore still living in domestic relations with the poet when Modeste’s letter arrived,—in such relations, be it said, as involved a perpetual sacrifice of his feelings.La Briere admitted the frankness with which Canalis had laid himself bare before him.Moreover, the defects of the man, who will always be considered a great poet during his lifetime and flattered as Martmontel was flattered, were only the wrong side of his brilliant qualities.Without his vanity and his magniloquence it is possible that he might never have acquired the sonorous elocution which is so useful and even necessary an instrument in political life.His cold-bloodedness touched at certain points on rectitude and loyalty; his ostentation had a lining of generosity.Results, we must remember, are to the profit of society; motives concern God."
"但莫黛斯特的信寄到之后，埃内斯特再也无法为卡那利而欺骗自己了。两个人刚吃完早餐，正在诗人的书房里聊天。书房在庭院尽头的住宅底层，面向花园。","But after the arrival of Modeste’s letter Ernest deceived himself no longer as to Canalis.The pair had just finished breakfast and were talking together in the poet’s study, which was on the ground-floor of a house standing back in a court-yard, and looked into a garden."
"“你瞧！”卡那利说道，“我前几天跟德肖利厄夫人说我应该创作一首新诗，我知道人们对我的崇拜之情正在减少，因为我已经很长时间没收到匿名信了。”","“There!” exclaimed Canalis, “I was telling Madame de Chaulieu the other day that I ought to bring out another poem; I knew admiration was running short, for I have had no anonymous letters for a long time.”"
"“这是一位无名女子写的吗？”","“Is it from an unknown woman?”"
"“无名？是的！——勒阿弗尔一位名叫德埃斯特的姑娘，明显是个假名。”","“Unknown? yes!—a D’Este, in Havre; evidently a feigned name.”"
"卡那利把信递给拉布里埃。这首小诗，包含了所有隐藏的激情，简单地说，包含了可怜的莫黛斯特的心，而这颗心却被卡那利轻蔑地递了出去，那动作俨然一个被宠坏了的花花公子。","Canalis passed the letter to La Briere.The little poem, with all its hidden enthusiasms, in short, poor Modeste’s heart, was disdainfully handed over, with the gesture of a spoiled dandy."
"“这样真好，”律师说道，“拥有吸引这种情感的能力，使得一个可怜的女子摆脱天性、教育，以及世人给她划定的习俗，打破惯例。天才能赢得怎样的特权啊！像这样一封信，出自一位少女之手——一位真正的少女——没有隐藏的意义，只有真挚的热情——”","“It is a fine thing,” said the lawyer, “to have the power to attract such feelings; to force a poor woman to step out of the habits which nature, education, and the world dictate to her, to break through conventions.What privileges genius wins!A letter such as this, written by a young girl—a genuine young girl—without hidden meanings, with real enthusiasm—”"
"“好吧，那又怎样呢？”卡那利说。","“Well, what?” said Canalis."
"“哎呀，一个男人就算是像塔索那样饱受折磨，也会感觉得到了补偿。”拉布里埃喊道。","“Why, a man might suffer as much as Tasso and yet feel recompensed,” cried La Briere."
"“我亲爱的朋友，收到第一封、甚至第二封这样的信时，他会有这种感觉，但收到第三十封时他会怎样？还有，假设你发现这些年轻的狂热追随者是些小荡妇呢？或者，想象一位诗人沿着光明大道奔跑着去寻找她，在路的尽头却发现一位年迈的英国女人，坐在地界石上向你伸出手！再或者，如果这位邮局天使其实是一个极其丑陋的、急需一位如意郎君的女孩呢？啊，我的朋友！那样你的心就欢腾不起来了。”","“So he might, my dear fellow, by a first letter of that kind, and even a second; but how about the thirtieth?And suppose you find out that these young enthusiasts are little jades?Or imagine a poet rushing along the brilliant path in search of her, and finding at the end of it an old Englishwoman sitting on a mile-stone and offering you her hand!Or suppose this post-office angel should really be a rather ugly girl in quest of a husband?Ah, my boy! the effervescence then goes down.”"
"“我开始感觉到，”拉布里埃笑着说道，“荣誉里面有某种有毒的东西，就像一些艳丽的花儿有毒一样。”","“I begin to perceive,” said La Briere, smiling, “that there is something poisonous in glory, as there is in certain dazzling flowers.”"
"“还有，”卡那利接着说，“所有这些女人，即使她们头脑简单，也会有理想，而你是满足不了她们的。她们从来都不会对自己说诗人是爱慕虚荣的，就像我被指责爱慕虚荣那样。她们想象不出来，一个作家被她们那种狂热的兴奋摆布久了，脾气会变得多么坏、多么变幻莫测。她们希望他总是伟大的、高尚的，她们从来不会想到天才会是个病羔子，拿单会跟弗洛丽纳同居，德阿尔泰兹太胖，约瑟夫·勃里杜太瘦，贝朗热是瘸子，还有她们的爱神也会流鼻涕！像吕西安·德吕邦泼雷那样既是诗人又是美男子的人真是凤毛麟角。而我为什么要被这些溢美之词牵着鼻子走，最后被某个幻想破灭的女人用目光狠狠地泼一桶冷水呢？","“And then,” resumed Canalis, “all these women, even when they are simple-minded, have ideals, and you can’t satisfy them.They never say to themselves that a poet is a vain man, as I am accused of being; they can’t conceive what it is for an author to be at the mercy of a feverish excitement, which makes him disagreeable and capricious; they want him always grand, noble; it never occurs to them that genius is a disease, or that Nathan lives with Florine; that D’Arthez is too fat, and Joseph Bridau is too thin; that Beranger limps, and that their own particular deity may have the snuffles!A Lucien de Rubempre, poet and cupid, is a phoenix.And why should I go in search of compliments only to pull the string of a shower-bath of horrid looks from some disillusioned female?”"
"“那么，真正的诗人，”拉布里埃说道，“就应该像上帝那样，隐藏在自己世界的中心，只能在他的创作中被人看到。”","“Then the true poet,” said La Briere, “ought to remain hidden, like God, in the centre of his worlds, and be only seen in his own creations.”"
"“那样的话，名誉的代价也太高了，”卡那利回答说。“生活中有美好的事物。至于那封信，”他一边端起一杯茶，一边补充道，“我可以肯定地告诉你，当一个美貌的贵族女子爱上一位诗人时，她不会像一位爱上了名演员的公爵夫人那样，躲在角落的包厢里，她会觉得她的美貌、她的财富、她的名声足以保护她，她敢于像英雄史诗里那样公开地说：‘我是仙女卡吕普索，我爱忒勒马科斯。’故作神秘和编造假名是小聪明的伎俩。而我已经很久不理会那些戴面具的人了——”","“Glory would cost too dear in that case,” answered Canalis.“There is some good in life.As for that letter,” he added, taking a cup of tea, “I assure you that when a noble and beautiful woman loves a poet she does not hide in the corner boxes, like a duchess in love with an actor; she feels that her beauty, her fortune, her name are protection enough, and she dares to say openly, like an epic poem: ‘I am the nymph Calypso, enamored of Telemachus.’Mystery and feigned names are the resources of little minds.For my part I no longer answer masks—”"
"“我会爱上一个来追寻我的女子。”拉布里埃喊道，“亲爱的卡那利，对于你所说的一切，我的回答是：一个追求卓越人物的女孩肯定不会是平凡之辈，那样的女孩会过于谨慎，过于爱面子，过于胆怯。只有一位明星，一位——”","“I should love a woman who came to seek me,” cried La Briere.“To all you say I reply, my dear Canalis, that it cannot be an ordinary girl who aspires to a distinguished man; such a girl has too little trust, too much vanity; she is too faint-hearted.Only a star, a—”"
"“——公主！”卡那利大笑起来，喊道，“只有公主才会屈尊于他。亲爱的朋友，那种事是百年不遇啊。那样的爱情就像是一百年才开一次的花朵。让我告诉你吧，那些年轻貌美而又富有的公主有其他事情要考虑，她们像奇花异草一样，被枯老灌木一般空虚而有教养的傻子团团围着。我的梦想，唉！我那水晶般的梦想，从此时起便成了镶着玫瑰花环的科雷兹河——哎！我不能谈起它——它早已在我脚下成为碎片了。不，不，所有的匿名信都是有所乞求的，而那是一种怎样的乞求呢？如果你认为她年轻漂亮，那你来给她写信吧，你会自己发现她有什么乞求。没有什么比得上经验。对我而言，从理智上讲，我不可能爱上每一个女人，就连阿波罗，至少是贝尔维迪宫的阿波罗，也是一个必须保重身体的柔弱的肺病患者。”","“—princess!” cried Canalis, bursting into a shout of laughter; “only a princess can descend to him.My dear fellow, that doesn’t happen once in a hundred years.Such a love is like that flower that blossoms every century.Princesses, let me tell you, if they are young, rich, and beautiful, have something else to think of; they are surrounded like rare plants by a hedge of fools, well-bred idiots as hollow as elder-bushes!My dream, alas! the crystal of my dream, garlanded from hence to the Correze with roses—ah!I cannot speak of it—it is in fragments at my feet, and has long been so.No, no, all anonymous letters are begging letters; and what sort of begging?Write yourself to that young woman, if you suppose her young and pretty, and you’ll find out.There is nothing like experience.As for me, I can’t reasonably be expected to love every woman; Apollo, at any rate he of Belvedere, is a delicate consumptive who must take care of his health.”"
"“但是，当一个女人以这样一种方式给你写信的时候，在她的意识里，肯定有理由认为她能在温柔和美貌方面令其他任何一个女人黯然失色，”埃内斯特说道，“而且，我觉得你总会有点好奇吧——”","“But when a woman writes to you in this way her excuse must certainly be in her consciousness that she is able to eclipse in tenderness and beauty every other woman,” said Ernest, “and I should think you might feel some curiosity—”"
"“啊，”卡那利说，“我年少无知的朋友，请允许我履行对美丽的公爵夫人的誓言吧，她是我全部的快乐。”","“Ah,” said Canalis, “permit me, my juvenile friend, to abide by the beautiful duchess who is all my joy.”"
"“你说得对，你说得对！”埃内斯特喊道。然而，这位年轻的秘书把莫黛斯特的信读了又读，努力猜测这位匿名写信人的想法。","“You are right, you are right!” cried Ernest.However, the young secretary read and re-read Modeste’s letter, striving to guess the mind of its hidden writer."
"“这封信里没有一丁点溢美之词，”他说，“她甚至都没有谈到你的天赋，她是在跟你用心交流。如果是我的话，我会被这种谦逊的芳香——这种主动的呼应所打动的——”","“There is not the least fine-writing here,” he said, “she does not even talk of your genius; she speaks to your heart.In your place I should feel tempted by this fragrance of modesty,—this proposed agreement—”"
"“那么，成交！”卡那利笑着喊道，“回信吧，你自己将这次奇遇进行到底吧。三个月后告诉我结果——如果能持续那么久的话。”","“Then, sign it!” cried Canalis, laughing; “answer the letter and go to the end of the adventure yourself.You shall tell me the results three months hence—if the affair lasts so long.”"
"四天后，莫黛斯特收到了下面这封信。信纸很漂亮，外面套了两层信封，封口盖着卡那利的盾形徽章。","Four days later Modeste received the following letter, written on extremely fine paper, protected by two envelopes, and sealed with the arms of Canalis."
"小姐，对优秀作品的赞美（姑且说我的作品是优秀的吧）含有某种高尚和真挚的意味，因此您不会被任何人嘲笑，而且，就是在最为严厉的法官面前，也可以证明您给我写信这一举动是正当合理的。","Mademoiselle,—The admiration for fine works (allowing that my books are such) implies something so lofty and sincere as to protect you from all light jesting, and to justify before the sternest judge the step you have taken in writing to me."
"但首先，即使是受之有愧，我也要感谢您的盛情之举给我带来的快乐，因为蹩脚的诗人和真正的诗人都确信自己作品的内在价值，一旦受到称赞，自尊心会立刻感到满足。一位素不相识的女士对我的信任，能够减轻他人对我的指责带来的剧痛，而我的报答就是给她以友情。这友情的最好证明，就是同她分享我个人经验的果实，哪怕这样有可能会让她最鲜明生动的幻想化为泡影。","But first I must thank you for the pleasure which such proofs of sympathy afford, even though we may not merit them,—for the maker of verses and the true poet are equally certain of the intrinsic worth of their writings,—so readily does self-esteem lend itself to praise.The best proof of friendship that I can give to an unknown lady in exchange for a faith which allays the sting of criticism, is to share with her the harvest of my own experience, even at the risk of dispelling her most vivid illusions."
"小姐，一位少女最高贵的装饰便是纯净、圣洁、无可指责的生活之花。您在这个世界上是孤身一人吗？如果是，那就没什么可说的了。但如果您有一个家庭，有一位父亲或是母亲，想想看，您写信给一位素不相识的诗人，这封信将会给您的父母带来怎样的忧伤。并不是所有的作家都是天使，他们是有许多缺点的。有些人轻佻，有些人鲁莽，有些人浮夸，有些人野心勃勃，有些人沉迷酒色。相信我，不管您多么天真无邪，一个诗人多么具有骑士风度，您还是会在巴黎碰到许多堕落的行吟诗人，他们时刻准备唤起您的柔情，只为了有朝一日欺骗你的感情。那样的诗人不会像我这样，而是会以另外一种方式来解读您的信。他会曲解您的想法，而天真无邪的您对此是不会有所觉察的。有多少作家，就有多少种品格。您认为我能够理解您，这令我感到万分荣幸。但万一您落到一个伪君子、一个狂妄之徒的手里，他写的书可能是忧郁的，但他的生活却是一个永久的狂欢节，您会发现，由于您草率之举，竟撞见了一个思想邪恶的人，一个剧院后台的常客，或是某个同性恋胜地的英雄。您在长满铁线莲的凉亭下幻想诗人时，能闻到使手稿失去所有诗意的烟草味么？","Mademoiselle, the noblest adornment of a young girl is the flower of a pure and saintly and irreproachable life.Are you alone in the world?If you are, there is no need to say more.But if you have a family, a father or a mother, think of all the sorrow that might come to them from such a letter as yours addressed to a poet of whom you know nothing personally.All writers are not angels; they have many defects.Some are frivolous, heedless, foppish, ambitious, dissipated; and, believe me, no matter how imposing innocence may be, how chivalrous a poet is, you will meet with many a degenerate troubadour in Paris ready to cultivate your affection only to betray it.By such a man your letter would be interpreted otherwise than it is by me.He would see a thought that is not in it, which you, in your innocence, have not suspected.There are as many natures as there are writers.I am deeply flattered that you have judged me capable of understanding you; but had you, perchance, fallen upon a hypocrite, a scoffer, one whose books may be melancholy but whose life is a perpetual carnival, you would have found as the result of your generous imprudence an evil-minded man, the frequenter of green-rooms, perhaps a hero of some gay resort.In the bower of clematis where you dream of poets, can you smell the odor of the cigar which drives all poetry from the manuscript?"
"让我们进一步说吧。您肯定生活在海边吧？那么您过的那种充满幻想而又孤独的生活怎么会使一位诗人感兴趣呢？他的使命就是去想象一切并描绘一切。有什么现实能比得上想象呢？诗人们心中的年轻女孩们是如此完美，没有哪位夏娃的女儿能同她们媲美。那么，像您这样一位接受良好教育、注定成为一名贤妻良母的少女，请您告诉我，如果您理解了生活在这个可怕都市里的诗人的那些焦躁不安，您将会得到什么？用一句话来定义这座都市就够了——这是一座爱情的地狱。","But let us look still further.How could the dreamy, solitary life you lead, doubtless by the sea-shore, interest a poet, whose mission it is to imagine all, and to paint all?What reality can equal imagination?The young girls of the poets are so ideal that no living daughter of Eve can compete with them.And now tell me, what will you gain,—you, a young girl, brought up to be the virtuous mother of a family,—if you learn to comprehend the terrible agitations of a poet’s life in this dreadful capital, which may be defined by one sentence,—the hell in which men love."
"如果作为一位渴望知识的少女，想要活跃一下枯燥的生活，所以您才拿起笔给我写了这封信，那这一举动本身不就是堕落的表现吗？我该赋予您这封信怎样的意义呢？您是被排挤的某个社会团体的一分子吗？您想要寻找一位远方的朋友吗？或者，您是被自己外表的丑陋所折磨，但觉得自己仍有一颗能够给予并接受信任的高贵心灵？唉，唉，只能做一个令人心酸的结论了。您要么说得太多了，要么说得太少了；要么走得太远了，要么还不够远。要么我们就此结束通信，要么，如果您再继续写的话，告诉我比这封信里更多的内容。","If the desire to brighten the monotonous existence of a young girl thirsting for knowledge has led you to take your pen in hand and write to me, has not the step itself the appearance of degradation?What meaning am I to give to your letter?Are you one of a rejected caste, and do you seek a friend far away from you?Or, are you afflicted with personal ugliness, yet feeling within you a noble soul which can give and receive a confidence?Alas, alas, the conclusion to be drawn is grievous.You have said too much, or too little; you have gone too far, or not far enough.Either let us drop this correspondence, or, if you continue it, tell me more than in the letter you have now written me."
"但是，小姐，如果您还年轻，如果您很漂亮，如果您有个家，有一个家庭，如果要把心中宝贵的香膏和甘松香油倾注出来，就像抹大拉的马利亚将其涂在耶稣脚上一样，那就让您自己被一位与您般配的男子所赢得吧，成为每一位纯洁的年轻姑娘都应该成为的人——一位好女人，一个家庭的贤妻良母。一位诗人，是一位姑娘能收获的最糟糕的战利品。他爱慕虚荣，锋芒毕露，会深深刺伤一个女人合情合理的自尊心，而且会抹杀毫无生活经验之人的的一片柔情。诗人的妻子应该在爱他很久之后再跟他结婚，她必须要训练自己拥有天使的仁慈，拥有容忍之心，拥有母性的所有美德。小姐，这些品质在一位年轻姑娘身上还只是萌芽。","But, mademoiselle, if you are young, if you are beautiful, if you have a home, a family, if in your heart you have the precious ointment, the spikenard, to pour out, as did Magdalene on the feet of Jesus, let yourself be won by a man worthy of you; become what every pure young girl should be,—a good woman, the virtuous mother of a family.A poet is the saddest conquest that a girl can make; he is full of vanity, full of angles that will sharply wound a woman’s proper pride, and kill a tenderness which has no experience of life.The wife of a poet should love him long before she marries him; she must train herself to the charity of angels, to their forbearance, to all the virtues of motherhood.Such qualities, mademoiselle, are but germs in a young girl."
"这就是全部的事实——难道我不应该以此来回报您那令人醉心的恭维吗？如果嫁给伟大的名人是一件美好的事情，那也要记住，你很快就会发现，从一个人的各个方面来讲，伟人和常人没什么两样。因此，尽管人们对他寄予厚望，他却远远做不到那么完美。如果某个女人的美貌被过度夸大了，我们会这样评论她：“我还以为她比这漂亮得多呢。”对于他，也是一样。她没有为精灵给她画的肖像授权，我收到您的来信也是归功于这位精灵——它的名字叫做想象力。","Hear the whole truth,—do I not owe it to you in return for your intoxicating flattery?If it is a glorious thing to marry a great renown, remember also that you must soon discover a superior man to be, in all that makes a man, like other men.He therefore poorly realizes the hopes that attach to him as a phoenix.He becomes like a woman whose beauty is over-praised, and of whom we say: “I thought her far more lovely.”She has not warranted the portrait painted by the fairy to whom I owe your letter,—the fairy whose name is Imagination."
"相信我，精神方面的品质只在看不见的地方生存、成长，而不是在日常生活中。诗人的妻子要忍受重负，她看到珠宝制造出来，却从来不戴它们。如果是地位的光辉吸引了您，那现在听我说，它带来的快乐是转瞬即逝的。当您发现有些东西远看很完美，事实上却有许多粗糙之处，当您到达光辉的顶峰，却觉得高处不胜寒，您就会很痛苦。此外，对于涉世未深、从未经历过真正苦难的女子来说，一旦她们看到她们曾崇拜的东西的内部构造，便会马上终止对它的赏识。","Believe me, the qualities of the mind live and thrive only in a sphere invisible, not in daily life; the wife of a poet bears the burden; she sees the jewels manufactured, but she never wears them.If the glory of the position fascinates you, hear me now when I tell you that its pleasures are soon at an end.You will suffer when you find so many asperities in a nature which, from a distance, you thought equable, and such coldness at the shining summit.Moreover, as women never set their feet within the world of real difficulties, they cease to appreciate what they once admired as soon as they think they see the inner mechanism of it."
"我再谈谈我的最后一个看法，这并不是变相的请求，而是一位朋友的忠告。心灵的交流只能在彼此没有任何隐瞒的人之间才能发生。您能向一位素不相识的人袒露真正的自己吗？我不敢对此作出结论。","I close with a last thought, in which there is no disguised entreaty; it is the counsel of a friend.The exchange of souls can take place only between persons who are resolved to hide nothing from each other.Would you show yourself for such as you are to an unknown man?I dare not follow out the consequences of that idea."
"小姐，请您屈尊接受我们对所有女性的敬意，哪怕是那些不知姓名且戴着面具的女性。","Deign to accept, mademoiselle, the homage which we owe to all women, even those who are disguised and masked."
"这就是那封信，她一整天都把它贴身放在胸衣里，让它紧贴着怦怦跳动的心！她一直等到午夜才读这封信，思潮起伏、热切不安地等所有人睡着，等那庄严的寂静降临。为此，她还事先为诗人祈祷，在打开信之前已经（在想象中）把它读了上千遍。她想象过各种情形，唯独没想到的是这样一瓢冷水竟浇在了她那缥缈的幻想之上，并像氢氰酸腐蚀生命那样。将其溶解了。她除了吹熄蜡烛、缩进被子、把脸埋在床单里痛哭流泪，还能干什么呢？","So this was the letter she had worn between her flesh and her corset above her palpitating heart throughout one whole day!For this she had postponed the reading until the midnight hour when the household slept, waiting for the solemn silence with the eager anxiety of an imagination on fire!For this she had blessed the poet by anticipation, reading a thousand letters ere she opened one,—fancying all things, except this drop of cold water falling upon the vaporous forms of her illusion, and dissolving them as prussic acid dissolves life.What could she do but hide herself in her bed, blow out her candle, bury her face in the sheets and weep?"
"这一切都发生在七月初。但莫黛斯特一会儿就站了起来，她走过房间，并打开了窗户。她想透透气。鲜花的芳香，伴着夜晚的各种清新气息扑鼻而来。被月光点亮的大海如明镜一样闪闪发光。一只夜莺正在树上歌唱。“啊，那就是诗人！”莫黛斯特想，她的怒气立刻平息下来了。心酸的思虑在她的脑海里互相追逐着。她被伤到痛处了，她想把信再读一遍，便点亮了蜡烛。她研究了那些经过深思熟虑写下的字句，直到听到外面世界的呼吸声。","All this happened during the first days of July.But Modeste presently got up, walked across the room and opened the window.She wanted air.The fragrance of the flowers came to her with the peculiar freshness of the odors of the night.The sea, lighted by the moon, sparkled like a mirror.A nightingale was singing in a tree.“Ah, there is the poet!” thought Modeste, whose anger subsided at once.Bitter reflections chased each other through her mind.She was cut to the quick; she wished to re-read the letter, and lit a candle; she studied the sentences so carefully studied when written; and ended by hearing the wheezing voice of the outer world."
"“他是对的，而我错了。”她自言自语道，“但谁又会相信，在那位诗人光鲜的外表之下，我竟看到了莫里哀笔下的一位老者呢？”","“He is right, and I am wrong,” she said to herself.“But who could ever believe that under the starry mantle of a poet I should find nothing but one of Moliere’s old men?”"
"当一个女人或少女在犯罪时“当场被捕”，她会对目击者、肇事者或受害者恨之入骨。于是在真实的、率直的、桀骜不驯的莫黛斯特内心，产生了一种难以抑制的欲望，她想要战胜那位正直的人，将他置于某种致命的矛盾之中，这样便可以牙还牙。这位女孩，这个孩子——我们可以这样叫她，本是如此纯洁，她的大脑被误导了，一部分是由于她的阅读，一部分是由于她姐姐的苦难，而或许更多地是由于她在枯燥无味的生活中那危险的沉思——突然，一缕阳光掠过她的脸庞。她已经在这广阔的“怀疑”之海的岸边站了三个小时。这样的夜晚是终身难忘的。莫黛斯特径直走向她那张小小的中式桌子，那是她父亲送她的礼物。在那颗怦怦跳动的少女复仇之心的驱使下，写了一封信。","When a woman or young girl is taken in the act, “flagrante delicto,” she conceives a deadly hatred to the witness, the author, or the object of her fault.And so the true, the single-minded, the untamed and untamable Modeste conceived within her soul an unquenchable desire to get the better of that righteous spirit, to drive him into some fatal inconsistency, and so return him blow for blow.This girl, this child, as we may call her, so pure, whose head alone had been misguided,—partly by her reading, partly by her sister’s sorrows, and more perhaps by the dangerous meditations of her solitary life,—was suddenly caught by a ray of sunshine flickering across her face.She had been standing for three hours on the shores of the vast sea of Doubt.Nights like these are never forgotten.Modeste walked straight to her little Chinese table, a gift from her father, and wrote a letter dictated by the infernal spirit of vengeance which palpitates in the hearts of young girls."
"第八章 针锋相对","Chapter VIII Blade to Blade"
"致德卡那利先生：","To Monsieur de Canalis:"
"先生，您自然是一位伟大的诗人，而且还是一位正直之士。您对一位差点踏入深渊的少女表现得如此真诚直率，那您是否也能毫不虚伪、开诚布公地回答下面这个问题呢？","Monsieur,—You are certainly a great poet, and you are something more,—an honest man.After showing such loyal frankness to a young girl who was stepping to the verge of an abyss, have you enough left to answer without hypocrisy or evasion the following question?"
"假设有人在您的耳边说过（这可能是真的），欧·德埃斯特·莫小姐有六百万法郎，而且她还想找个蠢材做丈夫，您还会写下我手里拿着的这封回信么？您的想法、您的语言还会是一样的么？","Would you have written the letter I now hold in answer to mine,—would your ideas, your language have been the same,—had some one whispered in your ear (what may prove true), Mademoiselle O. d’Este M. has six millions and does intend to have a dunce for a master?"
"暂且认为这一假设成立吧。请您像对自己一样对我吧，什么都不要怕。我只有二十岁，但心智却不止二十，任何坦率之举都不会损害您在我心里的形象。当我从您的回信中读出您对我的信任时——如果您肯屈尊这样做——您会得到我对您第一封信的答复。","Admit the supposition for a moment.Be with me what you are with yourself; fear nothing.I am wiser than my twenty years; nothing that is frank can hurt you in my mind.When I have read your confidence, if you deign to make it, you shall receive from me an answer to your first letter."
"我一直敬仰您的才华，它总是如此地令人赞叹。请允许我向您的细心和真诚致敬，这让我一直都是，","Having admired your talent, often so sublime, permit me to do homage to your delicacy and your integrity, which force me to remain always,"
"您卑微的仆人，欧·德埃斯特·莫","Your humble servant, O. d’Este M."
"埃内斯特·德拉布里埃把信拿在手里，过了一会儿，便沿着林阴道散步去了。当风从四面吹来，他心乱如麻，仿佛一叶扁舟在暴风雨中摇曳。大部分年轻人，特别是真正的巴黎人，会用一句话解决这件事：“这个女孩有点轻佻。”但对于一个心灵高贵且真诚的年轻人来说，这种努力可以说是一种对真理的呼唤，唤醒了藏在每个人的良心深处的三位法官，让他忍不住立下誓言。荣誉、真理和正义站了起来，以他们的各种方式积极地呼喊。","When Ernest de La Briere had held this letter in his hands for some little time he went to walk along the boulevards, tossed in mind like a tiny vessel by a tempest when the wind is blowing from all points of the compass.Most young men, specially true Parisians, would have settled the matter in a single phrase, “The girl is a little hussy.”But for a youth whose soul was noble and true, this attempt to put him, as it were, upon his oath, this appeal to truth, had the power to awaken the three judges hidden in the conscience of every man.Honor, Truth, and Justice, getting on their feet, cried out in their several ways energetically."
"“啊，亲爱的埃内斯特，”真理说道，“你真不该那样教训一位富有的女继承人。不，我的孩子，你应该火速赶往勒阿弗尔，去弄明白这个女孩漂不漂亮，你应该为她对天才的偏爱而感到十分伤心。不过，如果你对你的朋友使点坏，把她对他的爱夺过来，德埃斯特小姐早就是你的女神了。”","“Ah, my dear Ernest,” said Truth, “you never would have read that lesson to a rich heiress.No, my boy; you would have gone in hot haste to Havre to find out if the girl were handsome, and you would have been very unhappy indeed at her preference for genius; and if you could have tripped up your friend and supplanted him in her affections, Mademoiselle d’Este would have been a divinity.”"
"“什么？”正义叫道，“你们这些有才又有能力却身无分文的人，不也总是哀叹，说女孩们嫁给了连给你们做奴仆都不配的人吗？你们斥责这个时代的物质主义，它总是催促着有钱人和有钱人联姻，却从来不会让那些有才却没钱的优秀青年娶一个有钱的姑娘。对此，你们公然痛骂、大声疾呼，然而现在有一位年轻女子反叛了那种时代精神，可是，看呀，诗人却对她的心灵回以重击！”","“What?” cried Justice, “are you not always bemoaning yourselves, you penniless men of wit and capacity, that rich girls marry beings whom you wouldn’t take as your servants?You rail against the materialism of the century which hastens to join wealth to wealth, and never marries some fine young man with brains and no money to a rich girl.What an outcry you make about it; and yet here is a young woman who revolts against that very spirit of the age, and behold! the poet replies with a blow at her heart!”"
"“富也好、穷也好，年轻也好、老也好，丑也好、漂亮也好，这个女孩是对的，她有自己的思维和判断力，她把你拖进自私自利的罪恶泥沼中，并让你了解它。”荣誉喊道，“她理应得到回复，一个诚挚、忠诚且直率的回复，最重要的是，这个回复必须是你思想的真实表达。检讨自己吧！倾听你的心声并清除它里面的卑鄙龌龊吧。莫里哀笔下的阿尔塞斯特会说什么呢？”","“Rich or poor, young or old, ugly or handsome, the girl is right; she has sense and judgment, she has tripped you over into the slough of self-interest and lets you know it,” cried Honor.“She deserves an answer, a sincere and loyal and frank answer, and, above all, the honest expression of your thought.Examine yourself! sound your heart and purge it of its meannesses.What would Moliere’s Alceste say?”"
"拉布里埃从鱼贩子街出发，步履缓慢，沉浸在这些思绪之中，花了一个多小时才走到修女大街。然后他沿着码头，走到了当时坐落在圣堂附近的行政法院。他并没有开始做那些他本该做的账目工作，而是任由自己思绪纷飞，心乱如麻。","And La Briere, having started from the boulevard Poissoniere, walked so slowly, absorbed in these reflections, that he was more than an hour in reaching the boulevard des Capucines.Then he followed the quays, which led him to the Cour des Comptes, situated in that time close to the Saint-Chapelle.Instead of beginning on the accounts as he should have done, he remained at the mercy of his perplexities."
"“有一件事是很明显的，”他对自己说道，“她没有六百万，但那不是重点——”","“One thing is evident,” he said to himself; “she hasn’t six millions; but that’s not the point—”"
"六天后，莫黛斯特收到了下面这封来信：","Six days later, Modeste received the following letter:"
"小姐：您不叫德埃斯特。这是一个用以掩盖您真实姓名的假名。对于一个对自己都不诚实的人，我需要吐露您所请求的实情么？我用一个问题来回答您的问题吧：您是出身名门，还是贵族家庭，还是中产阶级家庭？毫无疑问，伦理和道德是无法改变的，它们是一体的，但义务却会随着生活状态的不同而不同。就像是阳光从不同角度照射着同一地方，会产生让我们赞叹的变化，同样，道德也使社会义务同阶层和地位相一致。一名士兵的小小过错放在一名将军身上就是一个重大罪行，反之亦然。惯例并不是在所有的情况下都一样。对于一个在地里拾稻穗的女孩，对于一个每天靠缝纫赚十五个苏的姑娘，对于一个小零售商的女儿，对于一个富商的孩子，对于一个贵族的嗣女，对于一个埃斯特家族的女儿，要遵守的规矩都是不一样的。虽然国王和劳动者都要遵守经济法则，但国王是不能弯腰去捡一枚金币的，而劳动者却要沿原路去找丢掉的十个苏。身价六百万的埃斯特家族的女儿，有权利戴着羽毛装饰的宽沿帽，挥着手中的鞭子，两腿一夹马腹，像身披金边蕾丝的女战士一样骑着马，后面跟着一位男仆，来到诗人面前，说：“我喜欢诗歌，我乐意为莉奥诺拉对塔索的残酷之行赎罪！”但是，如果一位平民的女儿模仿她的行为，就会成为众人的笑柄。您属于哪一个阶层呢？请诚实地回答我，而我将会回答您给我提出的问题。","Mademoiselle,—You are not a D’Este.The name is a feigned one to conceal your own.Do I owe the revelations which you solicit to a person who is untruthful about herself?Question for question:Are you of an illustrious family? or a noble family? or a middle-class family?Undoubtedly ethics and morality cannot change; they are one: but obligations vary in the different states of life.Just as the sun lights up a scene diversely and produces differences which we admire, so morality conforms social duty to rank, to position.The peccadillo of a soldier is a crime in a general, and vice-versa.Observances are not alike in all cases.They are not the same for the gleaner in the field, for the girl who sews at fifteen sous a day, for the daughter of a petty shopkeeper, for the young bourgoise, for the child of a rich merchant, for the heiress of a noble family, for a daughter of the house of Este.A king must not stoop to pick up a piece of gold, but a laborer ought to retrace his steps to find ten sous; though both are equally bound to obey the laws of economy.A daughter of Este, who is worth six millions, has the right to wear a broad-brimmed hat and plume, to flourish her whip, press the flanks of her barb, and ride like an amazon decked in gold lace, with a lackey behind her, into the presence of a poet and say: “I love poetry; and I would fain expiate Leonora’s cruelty to Tasso!” but a daughter of the people would cover herself with ridicule by imitating her.To what class do you belong?Answer sincerely, and I will answer the question you have put to me."
"虽然我不能有幸当面结识您，但你我在诗歌方面的交流却将我们部分地连结了起来，因此，我不想对您讲任何庸俗的恭维话。也许，令上一位作家难堪已经使您品尝到了蓄意报复所带来的胜利喜悦。","As I have not the honor of knowing you personally, and yet am bound to you, in a measure, by the ties of poetic communion, I am unwilling to offer any commonplace compliments.Perhaps you have already won a malicious victory by thus embarrassing a maker of books."
"这位年轻人当然不缺少一位有名望之人可拥有的那种精明。邮递员给他带来了一封回信：","The young man was certainly not wanting in the sort of shrewdness which is permissible to a man of honor.By return courier he received an answer:—"
"致德卡那利先生：您变得越来越通情达理了，我亲爱的诗人。我的父亲是一位伯爵。我们家族的主要名人是一位红衣主教，在那个时代，红衣主教可与国王平起平坐。我是家里最后的后裔，在我之后，我的家族就要绝嗣了。但我仍可以凭着家徽进入欧洲的任何宫廷和宗教场所。我们跟卡那利家族是门当户对的。如果您能原谅我没有给您送去家徽，那您真是太宽容了。","To Monsieur de Canalis,—You grow more and more sensible, my dear poet.My father is a count.The chief glory of our house was a cardinal, in the days when cardinals walked the earth by the side of kings.I am the last of our family, which ends in me; but I have the necessary quarterings to make my entry into any court or chapter-house in Europe.We are quite the equals of the Canalis.You will be so kind as to excuse me from sending you our arms."
"请尽量坦率地回复我，就像我现在回复您一样。我期待您的回音，以便明确我还能否像现在这样自称，","Endeavor to answer me as truthfully as I have now answered you.I await your response to know if I can then sign myself as I do now,"
"您的仆人，欧·德埃斯特·莫","Your servant, O. d’Este M."
"“这个小淘气鬼！真是滥用特权。”拉布里埃喊道，“不过她确实够坦率！”","“The little mischief! how she abuses her privileges,” cried La Briere; “but isn’t she frank!”"
"给内阁大臣做过四年私人秘书，而且生活在巴黎，亲眼目睹了许多阴谋诡计的上演，有过这种经历的任何一个年轻人都无法保持完美无缺。事实上，最纯洁的心灵也或多或少会被这座帝王之都纸醉金迷的气息沾染。我们这位年轻的文书很高兴自己不是卡那利，他回了一封信，表示过几天一定给她想要的回复，理由是他所要坦白的事情很重要，另外部里的工作给了他很大的压力。这之后，他便坐上邮车前往勒阿弗尔了。","No young man can be four years private secretary to a cabinet minister, and live in Paris and observe the carrying on of many intrigues, with perfect impunity; in fact, the purest soul is more or less intoxicated by the heady atmosphere of the imperial city.Happy in the thought that he was not Canalis, our young secretary engaged a place in the mail-coach for Havre, after writing a letter in which he announced that the promised answer would be sent a few days later,—excusing the delay on the ground of the importance of the confession and the pressure of his duties at the ministry."
"他还细心地让邮政总局局长给勒阿弗尔的邮政局长写了封便函，让他替自己保密，并多加关照。这样，弗朗索瓦丝·科歇来取信时，埃内斯特便可以见到她，并悄悄地跟着她。他跟着弗朗索瓦丝来到了安古维尔，并看到了在木屋别墅窗户边的莫黛斯特·米尼翁。","He took care to get from the director-general of the post-office a note to the postmaster at Havre, requesting secrecy and attention to his wishes.Ernest was thus enabled to see Francoise Cochet when she came for the letters, and to follow her without exciting observation.Guided by her, he reached Ingouville and saw Modeste Mignon at the window of the Chalet."
"“怎么样，弗朗索瓦丝？”他听那位年轻的姑娘说道。她的仆人回答说：","“Well, Francoise?” he heard the young girl say, to which the maid responded,—"
"“是的，小姐，有一封信。”","“Yes, mademoiselle, I have one.”"
"埃内斯特被这位姑娘的绝世美貌镇住了。他沿原路返回，并向街上的一位行人打听那座华丽庄园的主人叫什么。","Struck by the girl’s great beauty, Ernest retraced his steps and asked a man on the street the name of the owner of that magnificent estate."
"“那座？”那个人朝着别墅点头问道。","“That?” said the man, nodding to the villa."
"“是的，朋友。”","“Yes, my friend.”"
"“哦，它是属于维尔坎先生的，他是勒阿弗尔最富有的船运商，腰缠万贯，连他自己都不知道自己到底有多少钱。”","“Oh, that belongs to Monsieur Vilquin, the richest shipping merchant in Havre, so rich he doesn’t know what he is worth.”"
"“据我所知，历史上没有维尔坎红衣教主啊。”埃内斯特一边往勒阿弗尔走，去赶回巴黎的夜班邮车，一边暗自思忖。他自然向邮政局长问起了维尔坎家族，并得知这个家族确实家财万贯。维尔坎先生有一儿二女，其中一个女儿嫁给了小阿尔图先生。拉布里埃很谨慎，并没表现出对维尔坎家族有所图的样子，但邮政局长已经在狡猾地看着他了。","“There is no Cardinal Vilquin that I know of in history,” thought Ernest, as he walked back to Havre for the night mail to Paris.Naturally he questioned the postmaster about the Vilquin family, and learned that it possessed an enormous fortune.Monsieur Vilquin had a son and two daughters, one of whom was married to Monsieur Althor, junior.Prudence kept La Briere from seeming anxious about the Vilquins; the postmaster was already looking at him slyly."
"“除了家人之外，现在还有其他人跟他们住在一起吗？”他问道。","“Is there there any one staying with them at the present moment,” he asked, “besides the family?”"
"“德埃鲁维尔一家现在在那儿。他们在谈论年轻的公爵同维尔坎二小姐的婚事。”","“The d’Herouville family is there just now.They do talk of a marriage between the young duke and the remaining Mademoiselle Vilquin.”"
"“啊！”埃内斯特想道，“瓦罗亚时代有一位大名鼎鼎的的红衣主教德埃鲁维尔，还有一位令人生畏的元帅，这位元帅在亨利四世时成了公爵。”","“Ha!” thought Ernest; “there was a celebrated Cardinal d’Herouville under the Valois, and a terrible marshal whom they made a duke in the time of Henri IV.”"
"埃内斯特回到了巴黎。光是看莫黛斯特那一眼，就足以让他魂牵梦萦了。他想，无论她富有还是贫穷，只要她有一颗高贵的心灵，他就愿意让她成为德拉布里埃夫人。想到这里，他便决定继续和她通信。","Ernest returned to Paris having seen enough of Modeste to dream of her, and to think that, whether she were rich or whether she were poor, if she had a noble soul he would like to make her Madame de La Briere; and so thinking, he resolved to continue the correspondence."
"啊！你们这些可怜的法国女人，竭尽所能地去隐姓埋名吧，试着在一个文明社会里编织生活的小浪漫吧。然而，在这个文明社会里，邮车往返的时间是要在大街上公布的，所有的信件都要被清点数目，并两次盖上邮戳，第一次是放进邮筒时，第二次是送达时；每座房子都要编号，每家住户的税款经核实后，会被印在门前的金属登记薄上。在不久的将来，还会把每一寸领地划成最小块的土地，连同最细微的特征在内，制成一本硕大的登记薄——一个巨人下令创作的巨作。轻率鲁莽的年轻女士们，不仅要试图逃脱警察的眼睛，还得逃离那些喋喋不休的街谈巷议。在乡下小镇，任何鸡毛蒜皮的琐事都会引发人们的兴趣，比如长官家饭后吃几种甜点啦，一户小康人家门口有几片吃剩的甜瓜啦，人们会竖起耳朵，捕捉勤俭节约的人存金币时发出的叮当声，还会整晚整晚估算村里、镇里，以及省里的收入。莫黛斯特算是侥幸逃脱了埃内斯特的此次侦探之旅。他已经为此感到悔恨了，但哪个巴黎人情愿让自己被一个乡下小姑娘欺骗呢？千万别上当！那句可怕的名言是一个男人心中所有高贵情感的溶解剂。","Ah! you poor women of France, try to remain hidden if you can; try to weave the least little romance about your lives in the midst of a civilization which posts in the public streets the hours when the coaches arrive and depart; which counts all letters and stamps them twice over, first with the hour when they are thrown into the boxes, and next with that of their delivery; which numbers the houses, prints the tax of every tenant on a metal register at the doors (after verifying its particulars), and will soon possess one vast register of every inch of its territory down to the smallest parcel of land, and the most insignificant features of it,—a giant work ordained by a giant.Try, imprudent young ladies, to escape not only the eye of the police, but the incessant chatter which takes place in a country town about the veriest trifles,—how many dishes the prefect has at his dessert, how many slices of melon are left at the door of some small householder,—which strains its ear to catch the chink of the gold a thrifty man lays by, and spends its evenings in calculating the incomes of the village and the town and the department.It was mere chance that enabled Modeste to escape discovery through Ernest’s reconnoitring expedition,—a step which he already regretted; but what Parisian can allow himself to be the dupe of a little country girl?Incapable of being duped! that horrid maxim is the dissolvent of all noble sentiments in man."
"下面这封信，我们能从字里行间读出埃内斯特良心上的每一次自责。读了这封信，我们也就可以猜得到这位正直的年轻小伙子在情感上所经历的煎熬了。","We can readily guess the struggle of feeling to which this honest young fellow fell a prey when we read the letter that he now indited, in which every stroke of the flail which scourged his conscience will be found to have left its trace."
"这就是几天之后一个晴朗的夏日，莫黛斯特坐在窗户旁边读的那封信：","This is what Modeste read a few days later, as she sat by her window on a fine summer’s day:—"
"小姐：坦白讲，没错，如果我确定您家财万贯的话，我的表现必定有所不同。为什么呢？我找了找原因，是这样的。在我们的内心有一种与生俱来的情感，这种情感因社交生活而过度膨胀，促使我们去追求和占有幸福。大部分人将幸福和获得幸福的方法混为一谈，在他们眼里，金钱是幸福的首要因素。因此，我受到那种在所有时代都把财富当作信仰的社会情感所驱使，便会不遗余力地想要赢得您的芳心。至少我认为我会那样做。您不能指望一个年轻男人拥有如此的智慧，为了良知放弃感官的快乐。相反，看到猎物时，人内心隐藏的野性会驱使着他前进。如果我知道您很富有，我就不会那样教训您，而是会说一些恭维和奉承的话。我那样做还能赢得尊重吗？我表示怀疑。小姐，在那种情况下，成功可以免除罪过，但幸福呢？那就是另外一回事了。如果我以那样的方式赢得了妻子，我还能信任她吗？几乎可以肯定地说，我会再信任她了。您之于我的优势迟早会离间我们。您的丈夫，不管您把他想象得多么伟大，最后都会责备您让他蒙羞了。您自己迟早也会瞧不起他的。坚强的人会宽恕，但诗人会哀嚎。小姐，这就是我出于真诚而不得不对您作出的答复。","Mademoiselle,—Without hypocrisy or evasion, yes, if I had been certain that you possessed an immense fortune I should have acted differently.Why? I have searched for the reason; here it is.We have within us an inborn feeling, inordinately developed by social life, which drives us to the pursuit and to the possession of happiness.Most men confound happiness with the means that lead to it; money in their eyes is the chief element of happiness.I should, therefore, have endeavored to win you, prompted by that social sentiment which has in all ages made wealth a religion.At least, I think I should.It is not to be expected of a man still young that he can have the wisdom to substitute sound sense for the pleasure of the senses; within sight of a prey the brutal instincts hidden in the heart of man drive him on.Instead of that lesson, I should have sent you compliments and flatteries.Should I have kept my own esteem in so doing?I doubt it.Mademoiselle, in such a case success brings absolution; but happiness?That is another thing.Should I have distrusted my wife had I won her in that way?Most assuredly I should.Your advance on me would sooner or later have come between us.Your husband, however grand your fancy may make him, would have ended by reproaching you for having abased him.You, yourself, might have come, sooner or later, to despise him.The strong man forgives, but the poet whines.Such, mademoiselle, is the answer which my honesty compels me to make to you."
"现在，请听我说。您已经成功地迫使我深刻反省了——首先是对还不够熟悉的您，其次是对我自己也了解甚少的自己。您搅动了我内心许多隐藏的、人人都有的邪恶思想，但它们又生发出一些美好、善良的想法。所以，我向您致以我最热烈的赞美，就像在海上我们赞美灯塔一样，因为它为我们指明礁石，让我们免于遇险。这就是我要坦白的事情，因为就算拿世界上所有的财富交换，我都不会放弃您对我的尊敬，也不会放弃我对您的尊敬。","And now, listen to me.You have the triumph of forcing me to reflect deeply,—first on you, whom I do not sufficiently know; next, on myself, of whom I knew too little.You have had the power to stir up many of the evil thoughts which crouched in my heart, as in all hearts; but from them something good and generous has come forth, and I salute you with my most fervent benedictions, just as at sea we salute the lighthouse which shows the rocks on which we were about to perish.Here is my confession, for I would not lose your esteem nor my own for all the treasures of earth."
"我期待着知道您的真实身份。我刚从勒阿弗尔回来，在那儿，我看到了弗朗索瓦丝·科歇，并跟着她到了安古维尔。您跟诗人所梦想的女人一样漂亮，但我不知道您是隐身于德埃鲁维尔小姐之后的维尔坎小姐，还是隐身于维尔坎小姐之后的德埃鲁维尔小姐。尽管在战场上采取任何手段都不为过，我还是为这样的窥探行为感到脸红，所以马上就停止了打听。您激起了我的好奇心。原谅我有点儿女人气，我相信，那是诗人的特权。","I wished to know who you are.I have just returned from Havre, where I saw Francoise Cochet, and followed her to Ingouville.You are as beautiful as the woman of a poet’s dream; but I do not know if you are Mademoiselle Vilquin concealed under Mademoiselle d’Herouville, or Mademoiselle d’Herouville hidden under Mademoiselle Vilquin.Though all is fair in war, I blushed at such spying and stopped short in my inquiries.You have roused my curiosity; forgive me for being somewhat of a woman; it is, I believe, the privilege of a poet."
"既然我已经敞开了我的心扉，让您解读，那么您会相信，我下面要补充的话也是真诚的。尽管我对您只有匆匆一瞥，但这已足以改变我对您的行为的看法。您不仅仅是一位女子，您更像一个诗人，像一首诗。是的，您身上有着比美貌更宝贵的东西，您是艺术的理想美，是梦幻的理想美。一位甘于接受平庸命运的平凡少女作出您这样的举动，是要受到指责的。但如果她有我在您身上发现的那种天性，那就另说了。在那些被命运抛入这个星球的一代芸芸众生之中，总有一些独特的灵魂。如果您不甘于习俗对妇女命运的束缚，把您漫长的、富有诗意的幻想写在了这封信中；如果您被您高贵而聪明的头脑里的冲动驱使着，想要了解一个被您称作天才的男人的生活，并最终同一颗与您心灵相交的心灵建立起一种非比寻常的友谊，全然不顾世俗对您性别的束缚，那么，您肯定就是一个例外了。那么，限制着大众行为的合理法则对您来说也太狭隘了。但如果是这样，就更有力地印证了我第一封信里的话——您要不是做得太过了，要不就是做得还不够。","Now that I have laid bare my heart and allowed you to read it, you will believe in the sincerity of what I am about to add.Though the glimpse I had of you was all too rapid, it has sufficed to modify my opinion of your conduct.You are a poet and a poem, even more than you are a woman.Yes, there is in you something more precious than beauty; you are the beautiful Ideal of art, of fancy.The step you took, blamable as it would be in an ordinary young girl, allotted to an every-day destiny, has another aspect if endowed with the nature which I now attribute to you.Among the crowd of beings flung by fate into the social life of this planet to make up a generation there are exceptional souls.If your letter is the outcome of long poetic reveries on the fate which conventions bring to women, if, constrained by the impulse of a lofty and intelligent mind, you have wished to understand the life of a man to whom you attribute the gift of genius, to the end that you may create a friendship withdrawn from the ordinary relations of life, with a soul in communion with your own, disregarding thus the ordinary trammels of your sex,—then, assuredly, you are an exception.The law which rightly limits the actions of the crowd is too limited for you.But in that case, the remark in my first letter returns in greater force,—you have done too much or not enough."
"您给了我帮助，迫使我去聆听自己的心声，请再次接受我对您的谢意。在法国有一个很普遍的谬论——婚姻应该是获得财富的一种方式，而您却纠正了我心中的这一错误观点。当我同良知进行斗争时，我听到一个神圣的声音呼唤着我。我庄重地发誓，要自己创造财富，在选择人生伴侣时不为种种贪婪的动机所左右。我还为您在我心里唤起的那该死的好奇心而自责。您没有六百万。在勒阿弗尔，拥有这样一笔财富的少女是不可能藏得住的；您立刻就会被成群结队的家世显赫的追求者发现，我看到他们在巴黎四处追求女继承人，而且已经派了一位显赫的王室侍从——一位年轻的公爵，到维尔坎府上去了。因此，相信我，我现在所表达的情感是抛开了所有浪漫或者现实的影响、在我脑海中形成的一个固定的生活准则。因此，请您像对待我第一封信那样，来理解并领会这封信的精神，以此向我证明，您有一颗即使违背了常规准则也值得被原谅的心灵。如果您注定是要过一种中产阶级的生活，就请遵守那将社会凝聚在一起的铁律吧。如果您的思想高于其他女性，那我赞赏您；但如果您屈从了您本应该压抑的冲动，那我同情您！伟大的家庭史诗《克拉丽莎·哈洛》里那绝妙的道德教训就是：正是那合情合理而又让人敬佩的爱情，让那可怜的受害者走向灭亡，因为那爱情是在家庭束缚的界限之外被构建、发展和追寻的。不管克拉丽莎的家庭多么残酷，甚至是愚蠢，它反对洛夫莱斯那样的浪子都是有道理的。家庭就是社会。请相信我，一位少女的荣誉，一位妇女的荣誉，必定在于总是将她最热烈的激情抑制在惯例允许的狭小限度内。如果我有一个女儿会成为德斯塔埃尔夫人那样的人，那我情愿她十五岁就死掉。假如您的女儿在名利场上百般炫耀，通过显露自己来博得众人的喝彩，一想到这里，难道您不会觉得痛苦吗？不管一个女人灵魂深处的诗意能够让她达到怎样的高度，她都必须在家庭的圣餐台上牺牲掉外在的优越。她的激情，她的天才，她对善的向往，一个女孩的全部诗情，都应该属于她所接受的男人，以及她带到这个世界上来的孩子。我想我在您身上看到了一种隐秘的欲望，您想要拓宽那束缚了所有女人的狭小的生活圈，并把爱情和激情注入到婚姻当中。啊！那是一个多么美丽的梦想啊！它不是没有可能的，只是会比较困难，但即使它实现了，在那些平庸之辈的眼里，它不也是——请原谅我用这个陈腐的字眼——“不可理喻”的吗？","Accept once more my thanks for the service you have rendered me, that of compelling me to sound my heart.You have corrected in me the false idea, only too common in France, that marriage should be a means of fortune.While I struggled with my conscience a sacred voice spoke to me.I swore solemnly to make my fortune myself, and not be led by motives of cupidity in choosing the companion of my life.I have also reproached myself for the blamable curiosity you have excited in me.You have not six millions.There is no concealment possible in Havre for a young lady who possesses such a fortune; you would be discovered at once by the pack of hounds of great families whom I see in Paris on the hunt after heiresses, and who have already sent one, the grand equerry, the young duke, among the Vilquins.Therefore, believe me, the sentiments I have now expressed are fixed in my mind as a rule of life, from which I have abstracted all influences of romance or of actual fact.Prove to me, therefore, that you have one of those souls which may be forgiven for its disobedience to the common law, by perceiving and comprehending the spirit of this letter as you did that of my first letter.If you are destined to a middle-class life, obey the iron law which holds society together.Lifted in mind above other women, I admire you; but if you seek to obey an impulse which you ought to repress, I pity you.The all-wise moral of that great domestic epic “Clarissa Harlowe” is that legitimate and honorable love led the poor victim to her ruin because it was conceived, developed, and pursued beyond the boundaries of family restraint.The family, however cruel and even foolish it may be, is in the right against the Lovelaces.The family is Society.Believe me, the glory of a young girl, of a woman, must always be that of repressing her most ardent impulses within the narrow sphere of conventions.If I had a daughter able to become a Madame de Stael I should wish her dead at fifteen.Can you imagine a daughter of yours flaunting on the stage of fame, exhibiting herself to win the plaudits of a crowd, and not suffer anguish at the thought?No matter to what heights a woman can rise by the inward poetry of her soul, she must sacrifice the outer signs of superiority on the altar of her home.Her impulse, her genius, her aspirations toward Good, the whole poem of a young girl’s being, should belong to the man she accepts and the children whom she brings into the world.I think I perceive in you a secret desire to widen the narrow circle of the life to which all women are condemned, and to put love and passion into marriage.Ah! it is a lovely dream! it is not impossible; it is difficult, but if realized, may it not be to the despair of souls—forgive me the hackneyed word—“incompris”?"
"如果您试图寻找一种柏拉图式的友谊，那以后它将会成为您的遗憾。如果您的信只是一个玩笑，请不要再写了。也许这个小小的浪漫故事会就此结束——是吗？它也还是有些成果的。我的责任感已被唤起了，而从您那方面讲，您已经学到了一些社交界的经验。把您的思想转回到真实生活中去吧，把您从文学中提取的激情注入到您女性的美德当中去吧。","If you seek a platonic friendship it will be to your sorrow in after years.If your letter was a jest, discontinue it.Perhaps this little romance is to end here—is it?It has not been without fruit.My sense of duty is aroused, and you, on your side, will have learned something of Society.Turn your thoughts to real life; throw the enthusiasms you have culled from literature into the virtues of your sex."
"别了，小姐。请您尊重我吧，这是我的荣幸。见过了您——或者说见过了一个我自认为是您的人，我已经知道了您的来信是浑然天成的；一朵如此美丽的花朵转向了太阳——诗歌的太阳。是的，像爱鲜花、爱音乐、爱大海的壮阔、爱大自然的美丽那样去热爱诗歌吧，把它们当作心灵的饰品去爱吧，但是，请记住我有幸跟您讲过的诗人的品性。请当心，像您所说的那样，不要嫁给一个蠢材，要去试图寻找上帝为您创造的伴侣。请相信我，总会有人懂得欣赏您，并让您幸福。如果我很富有，如果您很贫穷，我愿意将我的心和我的财富都放到您的脚下，因为我相信您的心灵充满了宝藏和忠诚，我可以绝对放心地把我的生命和荣誉都交给您。","Adieu, mademoiselle.Do me the honor to grant me your esteem.Having seen you, or one whom I believe to be you, I have known that your letter was simply natural; a flower so lovely turns to the sun—of poetry.Yes, love poetry as you love flowers, music, the grandeur of the sea, the beauties of nature; love them as an adornment of the soul, but remember what I have had the honor of telling you as to the nature of poets.Be cautious not to marry, as you say, a dunce, but seek the partner whom God has made for you.There are souls, believe me, who are fit to appreciate you, and to make you happy.If I were rich, if you were poor, I would lay my heart and my fortunes at your feet; for I believe your soul to be full of riches and of loyalty; to you I could confide my life and my honor in absolute security."
"再一次，再会了，再会了，金发夏娃最美丽的女儿。","Once more, adieu, adieu, fairest daughter of Eve the fair."
"读了这封信，就像是在沙漠中饮下一滴甘泉，压在莫黛斯特心头的沉重的大山被举了起来：接着，她便看到了制定计划时所犯的错误，于是便改变了计划。她给了弗朗索瓦丝一些信封，地址是她自己的，这位仆人可以把从巴黎寄来的信放到信封里，然后再放到邮箱里。莫黛斯特决定收到来信时，亲自到木屋门口去迎接邮递员。","The reading of this letter, swallowed like a drop of water in the desert, lifted the mountain which weighed heavily on Modeste’s heart: then she saw the mistake she had made in arranging her plan, and repaired it by giving Francoise some envelopes directed to herself, in which the maid could put the letters which came from Paris and drop them again into the box.Modeste resolved to receive the postman herself on the steps of the Chalet at the hour when he made his delivery."
"这封回信中，在卡那利光彩照人的幻象背后是可怜的拉布里埃的高贵心灵在跳动，它在莫黛斯特内心激起了五味杂陈、莫可名状的情感，如岸边更迭消涨的海浪。此刻，莫黛斯特凝望着广阔的大海，她在巴黎这片大海洋中捕获了一颗天使般的心灵，她发现高贵的心灵仍然可以与天才和谐共存，还有，最重要的是，她跟随了直觉的魔力之音，这一切大概都让她沉浸在喜悦之中。","As to the feelings that this reply, in which the noble heart of poor La Briere beat beneath the brilliant phantom of Canalis, excited in Modeste, they were as multifarious and confused as the waves which rushed to die along the shore while with her eyes fixed on the wide ocean she gave herself up to the joy of having (if we dare say so) harpooned an angelic soul in the Parisian Gulf, of having divined that hearts of price might still be found in harmony with genius, and, above all, for having followed the magic voice of intuition."
"一股强大的动力即将赋予她的生命以生气。她牢笼的铁栅栏被打破了：这座漂亮木屋的门闩和插销——它们哪儿去了？她的思想插上了翅膀。","A vast interest was now about to animate her life.The wires of her cage were broken: the bolts and bars of the pretty Chalet—where were they?Her thoughts took wings."
"“啊，父亲！”她向外面的地平线望去，大声喊道，“回来吧，让我们富有，让我们幸福吧。”","“Oh, father!” she cried, looking out to the horizon.“Come back and make us rich and happy.”"
"埃内斯特·德拉布里埃五天后收到的回信将会让读者了解到比任何详尽的专题论文还要多的东西。","The answer which Ernest de La Briere received some five days later will tell the reader more than any elaborate disquisition of ours."
"第九章 隐形的力量","Chapter IX The Power of the Unseen"
"致德卡纳利先生：","To Monsieur de Canalis:"
"我的朋友——请允许我这样称呼您——您让我欣喜不已；我真希望您正是这封信里所描绘的那样一个人，这是我第一次如此欣喜——哦，希望它不是最后一次！除了一位诗人，还会有谁能够如此细心周到地原谅并理解一位少女呢？","My friend,—Suffer me to give you that name,—you have delighted me; I would not have you other than you are in this letter, the first—oh, may it not be the last!Who but a poet could have excused and understood a young girl so delicately?"
"您来信的开头几行写得那么真诚，我愿意以同样的真诚与您交谈。首先，我要说，最幸运的是您并不认识我。我可以很高兴地向您保证，我既不是那个奇丑无比的维尔坎小姐，也不是那个极其高贵却形容枯槁的德埃鲁维尔小姐，她的年龄介于二十和四十之间，尚不能决定一次令人满意的约会。德埃鲁维尔红衣主教在教会历史上的辉煌，至少要比我们引以为唯一家族荣誉的红衣主教早上一个世纪——我说他是唯一的荣誉，是因为没有把中将，以及写了些中看不中用的小本杂诗集的修道院院长这类人算进去。","I wish to speak with the sincerity that dictated the first lines of your letter.And first, let me say that most fortunately you do not know me.I can joyfully assure you than I am neither that hideous Mademoiselle Vilquin nor the very noble and withered Mademoiselle d’Herouville who floats between twenty and forty years of age, unable to decide on a satisfactory date.The Cardinal d’Herouville flourished in the history of the Church at least a century before the cardinal of whom we boast as our only family glory,—for I take no account of lieutenant-generals, and abbes who write trumpery little verses."
"还有，我不是住在华丽的维尔坎别墅里，感谢上帝，在我的血管里，连千万分之一滴那流淌在柜台背后冰冷的血液也没有。我有一半德国血统，一半法国南部血统，我的头脑同日耳曼人一样爱幻想，血液里又有着普罗旺斯人的活泼。从我父母两方面来看，我都有贵族血统。从母亲那一边来看，我与《欧洲王族家谱年鉴》的每一页都有关系。简言之，我的防范措施做得很好。以任何人的能力，甚至以法律的力量，都无法揭开我隐姓埋名的神秘面纱。我将继续隐姓埋名、不为人知。","Moreover, I do not live in the magnificent villa Vilquin; there is not in my veins, thank God, the ten-millionth of a drop of that chilly blood which flows behind a counter.I come on one side from Germany, on the other from the south of France; my mind has a Teutonic love of reverie, my blood the vivacity of Provence.I am noble on my father’s and on my mother’s side.On my mother’s I derive from every page of the Almanach de Gotha.In short, my precautions are well taken.It is not in any man’s power, nor even in the power of the law, to unmask my incognito.I shall remain veiled, unknown."
"至于我的人格，还有诺曼人所讲的“个人财产”，请您放心好了。我至少同您那次拜访勒阿弗尔途中偶然看到的小姑娘（天真烂漫的她感到很幸福）一样漂亮；而且，虽然我散步时没有十个贵族之子伴我左右，我也不会认为自己是贫困潦倒之辈。我看过那些人为我上演的为人不齿的滑稽剧，不过是为了追求女继承人的百万家产。简言之，不要试图接近我，哪怕是同别人打赌。唉！尽管我像空气一样自由，但还是被监视和保护着——首先是被我自己，其次是被那些神经过敏且勇气十足的人们，如果您试图进入我的隐居处，他们会毫不犹豫地把刀刺进您的心脏。我说这些，不是为了激起您的勇气，或者激发您的好奇心。我相信，我不需要用这种刺激使您对我产生兴趣，让您爱上我。","As to my person and as to my “belongings,” as the Normans say, make yourself easy.I am at least as handsome as the little girl (ignorantly happy) on whom your eyes chanced to light during your visit to Havre; and I do not call myself poverty-stricken, although ten sons of peers may not accompany me on my walks.I have seen the humiliating comedy of the heiress sought for her millions played on my account.In short, make no attempt, even on a wager, to reach me.Alas! though free as air, I am watched and guarded,—by myself, in the first place, and secondly, by people of nerve and courage who would not hesitate to put a knife in your heart if you tried to penetrate my retreat.I do not say this to excite your courage or stimulate your curiosity; I believe I have no need of such incentives to interest you and attach you to me."
"您的第一场说教在您的第二个版本中又大大地扩展了，我现在便就此作出回复。","I will now reply to the second edition, considerably enlarged, of your first sermon."
"您希望我坦白吗？我看到您如此不信任我，并错把我当作科琳娜式的人物（其实我觉得她的那些即兴创作相当无聊），我便对自己说，很有可能是一群缪斯把轻率好奇的您带到了她们的圣谷之中，并请求您品尝她们的宿地帕那塞斯山的水果。啊，我的朋友！您跟我在一起是绝对安全的，我是热爱诗歌，但我的袖珍笔记本里没有短篇诗歌，而且我的长袜现在是、将来也永远是洁白无暇的。您将不会为一卷或者更多卷的《我心中的鲜花》而烦恼。最后，假若我哪天对您说了句“过来吧！”您现在知道了，您将不会看到一个老姑娘，不会的，也不会是一个又穷又丑的姑娘。","Will you have a confession?I said to myself when I saw you so distrustful, and mistaking me for Corinne (whose improvisations bore me dreadfully), that in all probability dozes of Muses had already led you, rashly curious, into their valleys, and begged you to taste the fruits of their boarding-school Parnassus.Oh! you are perfectly safe with me, my friend; I may love poetry, but I have no little verses in my pocket-book, and my stockings are, and will remain, immaculately white.You shall not be pestered with the “Flowers of my Heart” in one or more volumes.And, finally, should it ever happen that I say to you the word “Come!” you will not find—you know it now—an old maid, no, nor a poor and ugly one."
"啊！我的朋友，您不知道，我对您跑到勒阿弗尔来感到多么遗憾！您已减少了您口中我的浪漫故事的魅力了。一个足够高贵、足够令人信任，且足够敏锐的男人——信赖我的信件，一步一步地走进我的心灵深处——怀着孩童般的单纯来赴我们的第一次约会，只有上帝才知道我为这样的男人所预留的财富，因为那样才符合我梦想中天才男人的天真纯朴。而现在，您已经损坏了我的财富！但我原谅您，您住在巴黎，而且，如您所说，诗人的内心也和普通男人一样。","Ah! my friend, if you only knew how I regret that you came to Havre!You have lowered the charm of what you call my romance.God alone knew the treasure I was reserving for the man noble enough, and trusting enough, and perspicacious enough to come—having faith in my letters, having penetrated step by step into the depths of my heart—to come to our first meeting with the simplicity of a child: for that was what I dreamed to be the innocence of a man of genius.And now you have spoiled my treasure!But I forgive you; you live in Paris and, as you say, there is always a man within a poet."
"我告诉您这些，您会不会因此把我当作一个小女孩，在自己的花园里种满幻想呢？您，机智聪明的您，难道没有猜到，当德埃斯特小姐收到您那封迂腐的说教信时，她对自己说：“不，亲爱的诗人，我的第一封信不是一个游手好闲的小孩扔出去用来吓唬附近果树主人的小石子，而是一位坐在海中之石上的渔夫小心谨慎撒下的渔网，期望并等待着一次奇迹的收获。”","Because I tell you this will you think me some little girl who cultivates a garden-full of illusions?You, who are witty and wise, have you not guessed that when Mademoiselle d’Este received your pedantic lesson she said to herself: “No, dear poet, my first letter was not the pebble which a vagabond child flings about the highway to frighten the owner of the adjacent fruit-trees, but a net carefully and prudently thrown by a fisherman seated on a rock above the sea, hoping and expecting a miraculous draught.”"
"您所有有关家庭的美好说法，我都赞同。能够取悦我，而我又认为配得上我的男子，定会得到我的真心、我的生命。当然，这也需要我的父母同意才行，因为我既不会让他们伤心，也不会让他们毫不知情，幸运的是，我确信我能够左右他们，况且他们没有丝毫的偏见。的确，我觉得自己在各方面被保护得很好，我的梦想不含任何错觉。我已经用自己的双手建起了堡垒，而且还让那些视我如珍宝、无比忠诚地守护着我的人们把这座堡垒加固了。这倒不是说我在必要的时候不能公开保护自己，因为——这样说吧，境遇已经给我提供了一身防卫的盔甲，上面刻上了“蔑视”这个词。我对于一切精于算计的人和事——一切不纯洁、不公正，以及不是绝对高贵的人和事，都有着最深的痛恨。我崇拜美好的、理想的事物，却绝不空想，尽管在我内心深处，在我的梦中，我曾很爱空想。但我认清了很多事情的真相，甚至包括您给我讲过的那些社会及社交生活中的丑事。","All that you say so beautifully about the family has my approval.The man who is able to please me, and of whom I believe myself worthy, will have my heart and my life,—with the consent of my parents, for I will neither grieve them, nor take them unawares: happily, I am certain of reigning over them; and, besides, they are wholly without prejudice.Indeed, in every way, I feel myself protected against any delusions in my dream.I have built the fortress with my own hands, and I have let it be fortified by the boundless devotion of those who watch over me as if I were a treasure,—not that I am unable to defend myself in the open, if need be; for, let me say, circumstances have furnished me with armor of proof on which is engraved the word “Disdain.”I have the deepest horror of all that is calculating,—of all that is not pure, disinterested, and wholly noble.I worship the beautiful, the ideal, without being romantic; though I HAVE been, in my heart of hearts, in my dreams.But I recognize the truth of the various things, just even to vulgarity, which you have written me about Society and social life."
"目前，我们还是，也只能是朋友。为什么要找一个看不见的朋友呢？您会问。我可能不认识您本人，但您的思想，您的心灵，我是知道的，它们让我感到快乐，而且我内心深处涌出了无穷无尽的想法，需要一个天才的男子做它们的知己。我不希望我内心的诗情被浪费掉，我会让它被您所知，就像它被上帝所知一样。一个真正的密友是多么珍贵啊，我们可以向他吐露一切！当一位少女思绪中从未公开过的片段飘向您，就像美丽的虫子拍打着翅膀飞向太阳，您肯定不会拒绝吧？我可以肯定，您之前从未碰到过这样美好的心灵财富——一位诚实女孩的诚实的知心话。请您倾听她天真无邪的絮语吧，请您接受她内心为您吟唱的歌曲吧。日后，如果我们的心灵结成了伴侣，如果我们的性情许可了我们的尝试，一位白发老仆将会在路边等您，并带您到一座别墅，一座真正的别墅，一座城堡，一座宫殿——我现在还不知道它会是什么样式、什么颜色，甚至不知道这一结论是否可能，但您会承认那一幕是富有诗意的，德埃斯特小姐也有着顺从的天性，对吗？她不是把自由留给了您吗？她猜疑过您，到巴黎的沙龙里去观察过您吗？她有没有将古时候游侠们自愿去探寻的那种高风险任务强加给您呢？没有，她想要的是一种精神上的、神秘的完美结合。当您不高兴了、受伤了、疲惫了，请到我这儿来吧。告诉我一切吧，什么都不要隐瞒，对于您所有的病痛，我都有镇痛香膏。亲爱的朋友，我年方二十，但我感觉自己有五十岁，而且，不幸的是，通过另一个人的经历，我已经领悟到了爱情所有的恐怖和快乐。我知道人心能藏匿怎样的卑鄙和丑恶，然而我自己是个坦诚的女孩。不，我没有任何幻想；但我有一些更好的东西，一些真实的东西——我有一些信念和一种信仰。您看！我已经开始与您倾心交谈了。","For the time being we are, and we can only be, two friends.Why seek an unseen friend? you ask.Your person may be unknown to me, but your mind, your heart I know; they please me, and I feel an infinitude of thoughts within my soul which need a man of genius for their confidant.I do not wish the poem of my heart to be wasted; I would have it known to you as it is to God.What a precious thing is a true comrade, one to whom we can tell all!You will surely not reject the unpublished leaflets of a young girl’s thoughts when they fly to you like the pretty insects fluttering to the sun?I am sure you have never before met with this good fortune of the soul,—the honest confidences of an honest girl.Listen to her prattle; accept the music that she sings to you in her own heart.Later, if our souls are sisters, if our characters warrant the attempt, a white-haired old serving-man shall await you by the wayside and lead you to the cottage, the villa, the castle, the palace—I don’t know yet what sort of bower it will be, nor what its color, nor whether this conclusion will ever be possible; but you will admit, will you not? that it is poetic, and that Mademoiselle d’Este has a complying disposition.Has she not left you free?Has she gone with jealous feet to watch you in the salons of Paris?Has she imposed upon you the labors of some high emprise, such as paladins sought voluntarily in the olden time?No, she asks a perfectly spiritual and mystic alliance.Come to me when you are unhappy, wounded, weary.Tell me all, hide nothing; I have balms for all your ills.I am twenty years of age, dear friend, but I have the sense of fifty, and unfortunately I have known through the experience of another all the horrors and the delights of love.I know what baseness the human heart can contain, what infamy; yet I myself am an honest girl.No, I have no illusions; but I have something better, something real,—I have beliefs and a religion.See! I open the ball of our confidences."
"不管我嫁给谁——前提是我自己选择了他——他都可以安心睡大觉，或者到东印度去玩，回来的时候，他会看到我还在编织他临行前我开始编织的挂毯，而且从每一针每一线中他都可以读到以他为主人公谱写的诗篇。是的，我内心已经决定，永远都不会跟着我的丈夫去他不希望我去的地方。我将是他家里的女神。这就是我的人生信仰。但是，既然我之于这个男人，就如同生命之于身体，那我为什么不考验和挑选一下呢？一个男人会被生活束缚吗？一个会阻碍她所爱的男人的女人，会是什么样的呢？那会是一种疾病，一种病魔，而不是生活。说到生活，我指的是那种能将每时每刻都变成快乐的令人喜悦的健康状态。","Whoever I marry—provided I choose him for myself—may sleep in peace or go to the East Indies sure that he will find me on his return working at the tapestry which I began before he left me; and in every stitch he shall read a verse of the poem of which he has been the hero.Yes, I have resolved within my heart never to follow my husband where he does not wish me to go.I will be the divinity of his hearth.That is my religion of humanity.But why should I not test and choose the man to whom I am to be like the life to the body?Is a man ever impeded by life?What can that woman be who thwarts the man she loves?—an illness, a disease, not life.By life, I mean that joyous health which makes each hour a pleasure."
"不过话说回来，您的信将永远是我的财富。好了，言归正传，您的信包含着我所渴望的东西，它表达了一种平淡的情感，这种情感之于家庭生活，就像是空气之于肺，是必不可少的，没有了这种情感，就没有什么幸福可言了。像诚实的男人那样行事，像诗人那样思考，像女人恋爱那样去爱，这就是我对朋友的期待，现在，这期待从幻想变成现实了。","But to return to your letter, which will always be precious to me.Yes, jesting apart, it contains that which I desired, an expression of prosaic sentiments which are as necessary to family life as air to the lungs; and without which no happiness is possible.To act as an honest man, to think as a poet, to love as women love, that is what I longed for in my friend, and it is now no longer a chimera."
"再会了，我的朋友。我现在还很穷。这也是我要坚持隐姓埋名、不肯摘下面具、不肯走出坚不可摧的堡垒的原因之一。我在《讽刺剧》上读到了您最新的诗作——啊！真令人心花怒放，因为我对您灵魂深处的朴实与崇高已经略知一二。","Adieu, my friend.I am poor at this moment.That is one of the reasons why I cling to my concealment, my mask, my impregnable fortress.I have read your last verses in the “Revue,”—ah! with what delight, now that I am initiated in the austere loftiness of your secret soul."
"知道了一个少女为您祈祷，知道了您是她唯一的思想——除了她的父母，没有任何人能与您相比，这会让您感到不悦吗？这些为您而写、只有您的双眼才能看到、每页说的都是您的信纸，会有任何理由让您拒绝吗？也给我写这样的信吧！我太缺乏女人气了，但您的知心话——只要是毫无保留并且真实的——将足以构成我的幸福。","Will it make you unhappy to know that a young girl prays for you; that you are her solitary thought,—without a rival except in her father and mother?Can there be any reason why you should reject these pages full of you, written for you, seen by no eye but yours?Send me their counterpart.I am so little of a woman yet that your confidences—provided they are full and true—will suffice for your happiness."
"您的欧·德埃斯特·莫。","O. d’Este M."
"“天哪！我已坠入爱河了吗？”这位年轻文书发现自己读完信后，竟把它拿在手里呆了一个多小时，便大声喊道，“我该怎么做？她还以为自己是在给伟大的诗人写信呢！我还能继续欺骗下去吗？她是四十岁的女人，还是二十岁的女孩呢？”","“Good heavens! can I be in love already?” cried the young secretary, when he perceived that he had held the above letter in his hands more than an hour after reading it.“What shall I do?She thinks she is writing to the great poet!Can I continue the deception?Is she a woman of forty, or a girl of twenty?”"
"埃内斯特现在已经被这无形的巨大深渊深深吸引了。看不见的东西是无穷无尽的朦胧，没有什么比这更吸引人了。在那昏暗的广漠中，火光闪现，深渊中的明沟暗壑显现出画家马丁笔下的绚烂色彩。对于一个卡那利那样的大忙人来说，这样的艳遇就像是一朵被山泉冲走的风信子，但这位年轻文书生活更为清闲，在他脑海中，这位迷人女孩始终与窗边那位金发美女有着千丝万缕的联系，她牢牢地攫住了他的心，就像是狐狸闯进家禽饲养场似的，在他规律的生活中引起了许多不安。拉布里埃任由自己被这位神秘的通信者所占有，并又给她的上一封信回了一封信，一封自命不凡且精心揣摩过的信，然而，激情开始通过一种愠怒在信中流露出来。","Ernest was now fascinated by the great gulf of the unseen.The unseen is the obscurity of infinitude, and nothing is more alluring.In that sombre vastness fires flash, and furrow and color the abyss with fancies like those of Martin.For a busy man like Canalis, an adventure of this kind is swept away like a harebell by a mountain torrent, but in the more unoccupied life of the young secretary, this charming girl, whom his imagination persistently connected with the blonde beauty at the window, fastened upon his heart, and did as much mischief in his regulated life as a fox in a poultry-yard.La Briere allowed himself to be preoccupied by this mysterious correspondent; and he answered her last letter with another, a pretentious and carefully studied epistle, in which, however, passion begins to reveal itself through pique."
"小姐：您让自己占据了一位可怜诗人的心，潜意识里打算着如果他不是您所希望的那样，便离他而去，让他追悔莫及。可您却给他留下了短暂的完美印象（即使这只是他臆想出来的），还至少给了他幸福的预示，这样做难道是忠诚的吗？您在这封信里已经开始展现您高贵的内心，我当初还求您写信解释，实在是目光短浅。一个神秘女子，集这般过人的勇敢与创造力于一身，集如此丰富的想象与情感于一身，男人便很容易为之倾心。读了您的第一番知心话，有谁会不想认识您呢？就我而言，一想到您，就需要极力控制自己才能保持理性，因为您身上集中了所有能扰乱男人头脑或内心的一切。因此，我要充分利用您留给我的那一点点冷静，向您提出谦逊的劝告。","Mademoiselle,—Is it quite loyal in you to enthrone yourself in the heart of a poor poet with a latent intention of abandoning him if he is not exactly what you wish, leaving him to endless regrets,—showing him for a moment an image of perfection, were it only assumed, and at any rate giving him a foretaste of happiness?I was very short-sighted in soliciting this letter, in which you have begun to unfold the elegant fabric of your thoughts.A man can easily become enamored with a mysterious unknown who combines such fearlessness with such originality, so much imagination with so much feeling.Who would not wish to know you after reading your first confidence?It requires a strong effort on my part to retain my senses in thinking of you, for you combine all that can trouble the head or the heart of man.I therefore make the most of the little self-possession you have left me to offer you my humble remonstrances."
"小姐，书信或多或少与写信人生活有联系，却也有或多或少的不真实。那些我们互相写的信只是我们在写信那一刻的情感表达，而不是我们生活的主旋律。虽然它们可能很美好，但我想问，难道您真的相信它们能代替我们在日常交流中对彼此表现出来的一面吗？人是双重的。有一种生活是看不见的，那就是心灵生活，书信能满足心灵生活。还有一种物质生活，人们更加注重它，唉，您这个年龄还意识不到。然而，这两种生活在您所追求的理想状态中必须要达到和谐统一，而我要顺带说一句，这是非常少见的。","Do you really believe, mademoiselle, that letters, more or less true in relation to the life of the writers, more or less insincere,—for those which we write to each other are the expressions of the moment at which we pen them, and not of the general tenor of our lives,—do you believe, I say, that beautiful as they may be, they can at all replace the representation that we could make of ourselves to each other by the revelations of daily intercourse?Man is dual.There is a life invisible, that of the heart, to which letters may suffice; and there is a life material, to which more importance is, alas, attached than you are aware of at your age.These two existences must, however, be made to harmonize in the ideal which you cherish; and this, I may remark in passing, is very rare."
"一个既有教养又纯真的隐士，内心充满纯洁、自然、无私的敬意，仿佛来自天国的花朵，其色彩和芬芳能抚慰每一份悲痛、每一道伤口、每一次背叛（这在文人的生活里是司空见惯的），而我要用与您同样的强烈情感来感谢您。我用我的悲伤来交换您慷慨施舍的珍珠，但有了这诗意的交换又如何？下面您期望的是什么？我既没有拜伦爵士的天才，也没有他显赫的地位。而最重要的是，我没有他捏造的罪孽的光环，也没有他社交生活中虚情假意的悲哀。但在类似的情况下，您对他能有什么期待呢？他的友情？唉，像他那种只会骄傲自负的人，已经被每一种虚荣——只会阻碍友情的病态的、急躁的虚荣——所吞噬了。我比他还渺小上千倍呢，难道我就不会有乖戾的性格，让友情成为难以承受的重负吗？您献出了您的幻想，会得到什么回报呢？无非是对一种不完全属于您的生活的不满。您同我的约定真是愚蠢。让我告诉您为什么。首先，您设想的诗篇只是一个剽窃物。一个年轻的德国女孩——她不像您只有一半的德国血统，而是百分之百的德国人——怀着少女的狂热爱慕着歌德。她把歌德当成自己的朋友，自己的信仰，自己的上帝，同时，她也知道歌德结婚了。歌德夫人是一位可敬的德国女人，她用心照不宣的和善容忍着这位崇拜者，但这并没有治愈贝蒂娜。但事情最终是怎样的呢？这位年轻的迷恋者嫁给了一位比歌德更年轻、更帅气的男子。现在，我们俩私下说，假设有个少女自愿做一位天才的侍女，做与他心灵相交的另一半，而且到死都虔诚地崇拜他，就像大师们在神秘圣地的百叶窗上勾画出的圣人那样。他（歌德）去世后，她便开始离群索居的生活，就像博林布鲁克爵士的朋友那样——我是说，我们就会承认这位少女会得到永生，与诗人的荣誉融为一体，就像抹大拉的马利亚与我们主的十字架和成就融为一体那样。如果那样做是伟大的，那对于相反的情形，您会怎么看呢？歌德和拜伦爵士是诗情和自我主义的两尊巨像。由于我既不是歌德，也不是拜伦爵士，而只是几首得到好评的诗歌的创作者，我不能期望有幸被人顶礼膜拜。我也无意成为一位殉道者。我有抱负，也有雄心，我还年轻，还要去开创我的事业。让您看看我是怎样的人吧。国王的赏金以及他的大臣们的保护，给了我足够的生活财富。我的外表和举止非常普通。我跟任何一个没头脑的纨绔子弟一样，参加巴黎的各种社交晚会。如果我乘马车的话，我的车轮也不是滚动在坚实的地面上，而是由近期投放在国家基金里的不动产支撑着的。但如果我不富裕，我也无法坦然去过阁楼上的生活，辛苦劳作却默默无闻，不被人所理解。这种生活属于比我更有价值的人——比如德阿尔泰兹。","The pure, spontaneous, disinterested homage of a solitary soul which is both educated and chaste, is one of those celestial flowers whose color and fragrance console for every grief, for every wound, for every betrayal which makes up the life of a literary man; and I thank you with an impulse equal to your own.But after this poetical exchange of my griefs for the pearls of your charity, what next? what do you expect?I have neither the genius nor the splendid position of Lord Byron; above all, I have not the halo of his fictitious damnation and his false social woes.But what could you have hoped from him in like circumstances?His friendship?Well, he who ought to have felt only pride was eaten up by vanity of every kind,—sickly, irritable vanity which discouraged friendship.I, a thousand-fold more insignificant than he, may I not have discordances of character, and make friendship a burden heavy indeed to bear?In exchange for your reveries, what will you gain?The dissatisfaction of a life which will not be wholly yours.The compact is madness.Let me tell you why.In the first place, your projected poem is a plagiarism.A young German girl, who was not, like you, semi-German, but altogether so, adored Goethe with the rash intoxication of girlhood.She made him her friend, her religion, her god, knowing at the same time that he was married.Madame Goethe, a worthy German woman, lent herself to this worship with a sly good-nature which did not cure Bettina.But what was the end of it all?The young ecstatic married a man who was younger and handsomer than Goethe.Now, between ourselves, let us admit that a young girl who should make herself the handmaid of a man of genius, his equal through comprehension, and should piously worship him till death, like one of those divine figures sketched by the masters on the shutters of their mystic shrines, and who, when Germany lost him, should have retired to some solitude away from men, like the friend of Lord Bolingbroke,—let us admit, I say, that the young girl would have lived forever, inlaid in the glory of the poet as Mary Magdalene in the cross and triumph of our Lord.If that is sublime, what say you to the reverse of the picture?As I am neither Goethe nor Lord Byron, the colossi of poetry and egotism, but simply the author of a few esteemed verses, I cannot expect the honors of a cult.Neither am I disposed to be a martyr.I have ambition, and I have a heart; I am still young and I have my career to make.See me for what I am.The bounty of the king and the protection of his ministers give me sufficient means of living.I have the outward bearing of a very ordinary man.I go to the soirees in Paris like any other empty-headed fop; and if I drive, the wheels of my carriage do not roll on the solid ground, absolutely indispensable in these days, of property invested in the funds.But if I am not rich, neither do I have the reliefs and consolations of life in a garret, the toil uncomprehended, the fame in penury, which belong to men who are worth far more than I,—D’Arthez, for instance."
"啊！您满怀青春的热情，幻想出种种迷人的场景，最后却发现是如此乏味的结局！我们就此停止来往吧。如果我有幸被您看做一位凡世的完人，那您对我来说就是一个光亮的尤物，一座灯塔，就像那些一闪而过的星星。希望没有任何东西会玷污我们生命的这段插曲。如果我们继续的话，我会爱上您，我会孕育一种疯狂的热情，它能摧毁一切障碍，能在一颗激情多于耐力的心上点燃火焰。然后，假设我成功地取悦了您呢？我们会以平常的、庸俗的方式结束我们的故事——结婚、组建家庭、生儿育女，贝莉丝和亨丽埃特·克里萨尔在一起了！——那可能吗？所以，还是再见吧。","Ah! what prosaic conclusions will your young enthusiasm find to these enchanting visions.Let us stop here.If I have had the happiness of seeming to you a terrestrial paragon, you have been to me a thing of light and a beacon, like those stars that shine for a moment and disappear.May nothing ever tarnish this episode of our lives.Were we to continue it I might love you; I might conceive one of those mad passions which rend all obstacles, which light fires in the heart whose violence is greater than their duration.And suppose I succeeded in pleasing you? we should end our tale in the common vulgar way,—marriage, a household, children, Belise and Henriette Chrysale together!—could it be?Therefore, adieu."
"第十章 心灵的婚姻","Chapter X The Marriage of Souls"
"致德卡那利先生：","To Monsieur de Canalis:"
"我的朋友：您的来信既给了我快乐，也给了我忧伤。但也许有一天，我们通信时将只会感到快乐。请充分地理解我的意思。心灵同上帝交流，并请求他赐予很多东西，可上帝默不作声。我试图在您身上找到上帝没有给我的答案。难道德古尔奈小姐和蒙田之间的友情就不能在我们之间再现吗？难道您不记得日内瓦的西斯蒙戴·德西斯蒙第一家了吗？听说那是人们所知道的最美好的家庭，与德佩斯凯尔侯爵同他的妻子有些相似，幸福地白头到老。啊！朋友，在一首交响乐中，两颗心，两张竖琴，遥相呼应，共同弹奏美妙的乐曲，这难道是不可能的吗？万物之中唯有人，能独自扮演竖琴、音乐家和观众三个角色。您看我像寻常女子那样，惴惴不安且好猜忌吗？我知道您出入交际场，遇到过巴黎最漂亮、最聪明的女人。难道我猜不到吗？一定是其中一条美人鱼垂青于您，用她那冰冷带鳞的双手拥抱您，在您心中激起那些乏味的想法，所以您的回答才如此让我伤心。生活中总有一些东西，要比巴黎女人卖弄风情的花环更漂亮。远在那些被称作“阿尔卑斯山之巅”的天才心中，生长着一种花朵，它是人类的光荣，天才们用他们高贵的头颅从天空汲取露水，给它以养分。我试图种植出那种花，并让它绽放，因为它那狂烈而又温和的芳香永远都不会消逝，它是永恒的。","My Friend,—Your letter gives me as much pain as pleasure.But perhaps some day we shall find nothing but pleasure in writing to each other.Understand me thoroughly.The soul speaks to God and asks him for many things; he is mute.I seek to obtain in you the answers that God does not make to me.Cannot the friendship of Mademoiselle de Gournay and Montaigne be revived in us?Do you not remember the household of Sismonde de Sismondi in Geneva?The most lovely home ever known, as I have been told; something like that of the Marquis de Pescaire and his wife,—happy to old age.Ah! friend, is it impossible that two hearts, two harps, should exist as in a symphony, answering each other from a distance, vibrating with delicious melody in unison?Man alone of all creation is in himself the harp, the musician, and the listener.Do you think to find me uneasy and jealous like ordinary women?I know that you go into the world and meet the handsomest and the wittiest women in Paris.May I not suppose that some one of those mermaids has deigned to clasp you in her cold and scaly arms, and that she has inspired the answer whose prosaic opinions sadden me?There is something in life more beautiful than the garlands of Parisian coquetry; there grows a flower far up those Alpine peaks called men of genius, the glory of humanity, which they fertilize with the dews their lofty heads draw from the skies.I seek to cultivate that flower and make it bloom; for its wild yet gentle fragrance can never fail,—it is eternal."
"请您给我点面子，相信我没有任何低贱或庸俗之处。我知道您说的贝蒂娜指的是谁，如果我是她，我就永远都不会做冯阿尔尼姆夫人；如果我是拜伦爵士众多的爱慕者之一，我此刻就会在一座修道院里。您触及了我的伤心处。您还不了解我，但您以后会了解的。我敢不带任何虚荣地说，我觉得自己内心深处有一种崇高的东西。上帝已将我所说的生长在阿尔卑斯山巅的花朵植根在我的心灵里，而我不能将它种在我窗台上的陶土花盆里，眼看着它死去。不，那绚丽的花蕾，它的美是独一无二的，它的芳香是令人陶醉的，它不会堕入生活的庸俗之中！它是属于您的——您的，在任何人的目光使它凋零之前，永远都是您的！是的，我的诗人，我的思想是属于您的——所有那些秘密的、欢快的思想都属于您；我的心是您的，充满无限爱恋，没有任何保留。如果您本人不能让我满意，我绝不结婚。我可以活在心灵的生活中，存在于您的思想里、您的情感里。它们让我快乐，而我会一直保持现在的状态，做您的朋友。您的思想与情感是一种高贵的道德天性，我已经认识并体会到了，这对我就已足够了。这就是我全部的未来。一位年轻漂亮的侍女，有一天会成为一位诗人的老伴——又有点像他的母亲，或是女管家，指引他的判断，成为他财富的来源。想到这些，她都不会退缩，所以请不要嘲笑她。这个女孩——她是如此忠诚，对您这样的人是如此难能可贵——就是友情的化身，纯洁、无私的友情的化身。您可以告诉她所有事情，她会聆听着，时不时地点点头；她会在灯下边做编织活边等待，这样，被大雨淋湿或是内心烦扰的诗人回到家时，就能看到她。如果我不能成为一个永远依附于丈夫的幸福妻子，那我的命运将会是这样，想到这两种命运，我都会微笑。您觉得，如果德埃斯特小姐没给法国生下两三个孩子，而且永远都没有成为维尔坎夫人那样的人，法国会因此变得更糟糕吗？就我而言，我永远都不会成为一位老姑娘。我会通过照顾他人，通过秘密进入一个伟大男人的生活——我也会将自己的全部思想及人世间的努力展现给他，让自己成为一位母亲。","Do me the honor to believe that there is nothing low or commonplace in me.Were I Bettina, for I know to whom you allude, I should never have become Madame von Arnim; and had I been one of Lord Byron’s many loves, I should be at this moment in a cloister.You have touched me to the quick.You do not know me, but you shall know me.I feel within me something that is sublime, of which I dare speak without vanity.God has put into my soul the roots of that Alpine flower born on the summits of which I speak, and I cannot plant it in an earthen pot upon my window-sill and see it die.No, that glorious flower-cup, single in its beauty, intoxicating in its fragrance, shall not be dragged through the vulgarities of life! it is yours—yours, before any eye has blighted it, yours forever!Yes, my poet, to you belong my thoughts,—all, those that are secret, those that are gayest; my heart is yours without reserve and with its infinite affection.If you should personally not please me, I shall never marry.I can live in the life of the heart, I can exist on your mind, your sentiments; they please me, and I will always be what I am, your friend.Yours is a noble moral nature; I have recognized it, I have appreciated it, and that suffices me.In that is all my future.Do not laugh at a young and pretty handmaiden who shrinks not from the thought of being some day the old companion of a poet,—a sort of mother perhaps, or a housekeeper; the guide of his judgment and a source of his wealth.This handmaiden—so devoted, so precious to the lives of such as you—is Friendship, pure, disinterested friendship, to whom you will tell all, who listens and sometimes shakes her head; who knits by the light of the lamp and waits to be present when the poet returns home soaked with rain, or vexed in mind.Such shall be my destiny if I do not find that of a happy wife attached forever to her husband; I smile alike at the thought of either fate.Do you believe France will be any the worse if Mademoiselle d’Este does not give it two or three sons, and never becomes a Madame Vilquin-something-or-other?As for me, I shall never be an old maid.I shall make myself a mother, by taking care of others and by my secret co-operation in the existence of a great man, to whom also I shall carry all my thoughts and all my earthly efforts."
"我对庸俗有着最深的痛恨。如果我享有自由，如果我很富有（我知道自己年轻漂亮），我绝不会委身于某个傻子，仅仅因为他是某法国贵族的儿子，也不会嫁给一个能在一夜之间把我和他自己都毁掉的商人。当然，我也不会嫁给那种在家里像个女人样的俊男，或是那种结婚后会让我一天脸红二十次的男人。在这一点上，请您放心好了。我父亲尊重我的愿望，他永远都不会反对我。如果我让我的诗人快乐，而且他也让我快乐，我们爱情的壮丽大厦将会被建造得无比高大，任何不幸都不可企及。我是一只小鹰，您将会从我的双眸中看出这一点。","I have the deepest horror of commonplaceness.If I am free, if I am rich (and I know that I am young and pretty), I will never belong to any ninny just because he is the son of a peer of France, nor to a merchant who could ruin himself and me in a day, nor to a handsome creature who would be a sort of woman in the household, nor to a man of any kind who would make me blush twenty times a day for being his.Make yourself easy on that point.My father adores my wishes; he will never oppose them.If I please my poet, and he pleases me, the glorious structure of our love shall be built so high as to be inaccessible to any kind of misfortune.I am an eaglet; and you will see it in my eyes."
"我不会重复已经说过的话，但我会尽量用最少的字词来表达要旨，并向您坦言，如果我被爱情监禁起来，就像我现在出于父亲的意愿和嘱咐被监禁起来一样，那我会是最幸福的女人。啊！我的朋友，这是我第一次把愿望付诸实践，我们给我们之间的浪漫故事一个真实的结局好吗？请您听听我的理由：","I shall not repeat what I have already said, but I will put its substance in the least possible number of words, and confess to you that I should be the happiest of women if I were imprisoned by love as I am now imprisoned by the wish and will of a father.Ah! my friend, may we bring to a real end the romance that has come to us through the first exercise of my will: listen to its argument:—"
"一位想象力丰富的少女，被锁在塔楼里，只能用目光环顾面前的花园，可她却渴望着能够在花园里自由自在地奔跑，这渴望令她疲倦。她想出了一个拆开栅栏的方法，她从窗台上跳下，爬过花园的围墙，在邻居的草地上嬉戏——这是一出永恒的喜剧。是的，那个少女就是我的心灵，邻居的花园就是您的天才。难道这一切不是很自然吗？邻居的栅栏不知被谁的脚踩坏了，他不会因此而抱怨吗？我把这个问题留给我的诗人去回答。","A young girl with a lively imagination, locked up in a tower, is weary with longing to run loose in the park where her eyes only are allowed to rove.She invents a way to loosen her bars; she jumps from the casement; she scales the park wall; she frolics along the neighbor’s sward—it is the Everlasting comedy.Well, that young girl is my soul, the neighbor’s park is your genius.Is it not all very natural?Was there ever a neighbor that did not complain that unknown feet broke down his trellises?I leave it to my poet to answer."
"但这位模仿莫里哀的傲慢的说理者是不是还需要更好的理由呢？好吧，理由来了。我亲爱的皆隆特，婚姻的建立往往是违背常理的。父母打听一位年轻小伙子的情况。这位由某朋友介绍或在舞厅里碰上的赖昂德，如果他不是一个小偷，名声方面也没什么明显的缺陷，如果他拥有必要的财富，如果他毕业于一所大学或法律学校，符合人们对于受教育的普遍看法，如果他衣着很有绅士风度，那他就会被允许见一见这位年轻姑娘。姑娘的母亲命令她要管住自己的舌头，不要让情感或内心的迹象显现在脸上，要保持着一位芭蕾舞演员完成一次竖趾旋转时的微笑。除了这些命令，父母还教导她关于袒露真性情的危险，并建议她不要摆出一副教养过好的样子，把人吓跑。如果一切问题都谈妥了，双方父母就会很和善地让这对新人相处一会儿。他们可以一起交谈或散步，但总是没有一点点自由，他们知道，他们已经被死板的规约绑在一起了。男子将心灵和身体好好打扮起来，年轻的姑娘也是这样。这部可悲的喜剧，混合着鲜花、首饰还有剧院派对，名字就叫做“献出您的殷勤。”它让我感到厌恶。我渴望的真正的婚姻要以长久的心灵结合为前提。在一位少女、一个女人的一生中，只有这一刻，深思、先见之明和经验对她来说才是必要的。她用她的自由和幸福做赌注，但她却不可以掷骰子，她冒了所有的险，却被迫做一个纯粹的旁观者。我有权利、有愿望、有能力去创造自己的不幸，我像我母亲那样行使这些权利。她被美所征服，遵从直觉的指引，嫁给了最善良大方、最心胸宽阔、最一往情深的男子。我知道您尚未结婚，是一个诗人，而且外表高贵。可以肯定地说，您的任何一位同行，哪怕他长得像阿波罗，但已经结婚了，我也不会选择他。如果说我的母亲被美所征服，而美也许是外形的内在流露，那我为什么不会被形与神的结合所吸引呢？通过您的书信来考察您，比起通过“接受您的殷勤”这一庸俗的体验，不是能更好地了解您吗？正如哈姆雷特所说，这是问题所在。","But does the lofty reasoner after the fashion of Moliere want still better reasons?Well, here they are.My dear Geronte, marriages are usually made in defiance of common-sense.Parents make inquiries about a young man.If the Leander—who is supplied by some friend, or caught in a ball-room—is not a thief, and has no visible rent in his reputation, if he has the necessary fortune, if he comes from a college or a law-school and so fulfils the popular ideas of education, and if he wears his clothes with a gentlemanly air, he is allowed to meet the young lady, whose mother has ordered her to guard her tongue, to let no sign of her heart or soul appear on her face, which must wear the smile of a danseuse finishing a pirouette.These commands are coupled with instructions as to the danger of revealing her real character, and the additional advice of not seeming alarmingly well educated.If the settlements have all been agreed upon, the parents are good-natured enough to let the pair see each other for a few moments; they are allowed to talk or walk together, but always without the slightest freedom, and knowing that they are bound by rigid rules.The man is as much dressed up in soul as he is in body, and so is the young girl.This pitiable comedy, mixed with bouquets, jewels, and theatre-parties is called “paying your addresses.”It revolts me: I desire that actual marriage shall be the result of a previous and long marriage of souls.A young girl, a woman, has throughout her life only this one moment when reflection, second sight, and experience are necessary to her.She plays her liberty, her happiness, and she is not allowed to throw the dice; she risks her all, and is forced to be a mere spectator.I have the right, the will, the power to make my own unhappiness, and I use them, as did my mother, who, won by beauty and led by instinct, married the most generous, the most liberal, the most loving of men.I know that you are free, a poet, and noble-looking.Be sure that I should not have chosen one of your brothers in Apollo who was already married.If my mother was won by beauty, which is perhaps the spirit of form, why should I not be attracted by the spirit and the form united?Shall I not know you better by studying you in this correspondence than I could through the vulgar experience of “receiving your addresses”?This is the question, as Hamlet says."
"但是，亲爱的克里萨尔，我的做法至少有一个长处，那就是不会把我们本人束缚在一起。我知道爱情含有幻想的成分，而所有幻想都会有尽头。这就是为什么那些发誓相伴终生的情人当中，会有那么多人分手。爱情的考验在于两方面——痛苦和幸福。当两个人经过这些生活的双重考验，向彼此表现出了各自的缺点和优点，当他们真正了解了彼此的性格，那么，他们就可以携手一直走到坟墓了。我亲爱的阿尔冈特，谁告诉您我们之间刚刚开演的小戏剧是没有未来的？不管怎样，难道我们没有享受到通信的快乐吗？","But my proceedings, dear Chrysale, have at least the merit of not binding us personally.I know that love has its illusions, and every illusion its tomorrow.That is why there are so many partings among lovers vowed to each other for life.The proof of love lies in two things,—suffering and happiness.When, after passing through these double trials of life two beings have shown each other their defects as well as their good qualities, when they have really observed each other’s character, then they may go to their grave hand in hand.My dear Argante, who told you that our little drama thus begun was to have no future?In any case shall we not have enjoyed the pleasures of our correspondence?"
"我等着您的吩咐，殿下，我会用我全部的真心，","I await your orders, monseigneur, and I am with all my heart,"
"您的仆人，","Your handmaiden,"
"欧·德埃斯特·莫","O. d’Este M."
"致欧·德埃斯特·莫小姐：您是一位巫师，一个精灵，我爱您！那就是您对我的希望，您这个最古灵精怪的女孩？或许，您仅仅是想让一位诗人作出什么蠢事，给您闲适的外省生活带来些消遣。如果是这样，您可就做了一件坏事。您的两封信里有足够的捣蛋意味，才使得我这个巴黎人的头脑里产生这样的怀疑。但我已经不是自己的主人了，我的人生、我的未来，都取决于您将给我的答复。请告诉我，如果您肯定能得到一种不顾一切社会习俗的无限柔情，您会不会动心——您是否会接受我追求您。我本人能否令您满意，对于这个问题，我相当焦虑和不确定。如果您的回复是肯定的，我会改变我的生活，我会告别所有那些我们愚蠢地称之为幸福的、令人厌倦的快乐。我亲爱的、美丽的匿名姑娘，幸福正是您所梦想的那样——一种情感的融合，一种心灵间的完美契合，一种高贵理想（比如上帝允许我们在俗世所拥有的理想）在我们必须循规蹈矩的日常生活琐事上打下的烙印，一种心灵的忠贞不渝，比我们所说的忠诚还要宝贵得多。我们可以这样说吗？当我们最终的目的是永恒的幸福、诗人的梦想、少女的梦想，还有诗情，我们就要作出牺牲。每一个高尚的智者，从他迈进生活的门槛时起，从他展开思想的翅膀时起，他就深思并爱护着内心的诗情，结果却眼看着这些诗情碰到低俗坚硬的绊脚石，摔得粉碎——对于大部分人来说，现实的脚马上会践踏到这如此少见的神秘之蛋。","To Mademoiselle O. d’Este M.,—You are a witch, a spirit, and I love you!Is that what you desire of me, most original of girls?Perhaps you are only seeking to amuse your provincial leisure with the follies which are you able to make a poet commit.If so, you have done a bad deed.Your two letters have enough of the spirit of mischief in them to force this doubt into the mind of a Parisian.But I am no longer master of myself; my life, my future depend on the answer you will make me.Tell me if the certainty of an unbounded affection, oblivious of all social conventions, will touch you,—if you will suffer me to seek you.There is anxiety enough and uncertainty enough in the question as to whether I can personally please you.If your reply is favorable I change my life, I bid adieu to all the irksome pleasures which we have the folly to call happiness.Happiness, my dear and beautiful unknown, is what you dream it to be,—a fusion of feelings, a perfect accordance of souls, the imprint of a noble ideal (such as God does permit us to form in this low world) upon the trivial round of daily life whose habits we must needs obey, a constancy of heart more precious far than what we call fidelity.Can we say that we make sacrifices when the end in view is our eternal good, the dream of poets, the dream of maidens, the poem which, at the entrance of life when thought essays its wings, each noble intellect has pondered and caressed only to see it shivered to fragments on some stone of stumbling as hard as it is vulgar?—for to the great majority of men, the foot of reality steps instantly on that mysterious egg so seldom hatched."
"我不能跟您说更多关于我的事，不能说我过去的生活，也不能说我的性格。还有另一个人和我之间近乎父子之情的情感，也不能告诉您。但您已经大大地改变了这一情感——它对我生活的影响可以解释我为什么用“牺牲”这个词。您已经让我变得即使不是忘恩负义、也是心不在焉了，这样您满意了吗？唉，您说吧！只要您说一句话，我就会爱您，直到闭上双眼死去，就像德佩斯凯尔爱他的妻子那样，像罗密欧爱朱丽叶那样，忠贞不渝地爱您。我们的生活，至少对我而言，将会是但丁所说的“无忧无虑的天伦之乐”，在《天堂篇》——一首比他的《地狱篇》优秀得多的诗歌——里，但丁认为这种快乐是天堂的基本元素。像您一样，我在久久的冥想中跟一个梦中人绕着圈子，奇怪的是，在这冥想中，我怀疑的不是自己，而是您。是的，亲爱的，我觉得我的内心有力量去爱，无止尽地爱——从容漫步，笑容满面，挽着我心上人的手，一直走到坟墓，不会有一片乌云遮住我们心灵的阳光。是的，我敢于面对我们彼此的晚年，看到我们像那位德高望重的意大利历史学家一样白发苍苍，还总是怀着同样的柔情，只是随着生命的不同阶段有着不同的心灵体验。听我说，我不能再只做您的朋友了。尽管您说克里萨尔、皆隆特和阿尔冈特在我身上复活，但我还没那么老气横秋，一位蒙着面纱的女子用她可爱的双手将酒杯举到我的嘴边，喝着酒杯里的酒，我怎能没有一种强烈的愿望，想要脱掉她化妆舞会的外衣，摘掉她的面具，看看她的脸。您要不就别再给我写信了，要不就给我希望。要不让我见见您，要不就让我走。我一定要跟您说再见了吗？您会允许我在信尾署名，","I cannot speak to you any more of myself; not of my past life, nor of my character, nor of an affection almost maternal on one side, filial on mine, which you have already seriously changed—an effect upon my life which must explain my use of the word “sacrifice.”You have already rendered me forgetful, if not ungrateful; does that satisfy you?Oh, speak!Say to me one word, and I will love you till my eyes close in death, as the Marquis de Pescaire loved his wife, as Romeo loved Juliet, and faithfully.Our life will be, for me at least, that “felicity untroubled” which Dante made the very element of his Paradiso,—a poem far superior to his Inferno.Strange, it is not myself that I doubt in the long reverie through which, like you, I follow the windings of a dreamed existence; it is you.Yes, dear, I feel within me the power to love, and to love endlessly,—to march to the grave with gentle slowness and a smiling eye, with my beloved on my arm, and with never a cloud upon the sunshine of our souls.Yes, I dare to face our mutual old age, to see ourselves with whitening heads, like the venerable historian of Italy, inspired always with the same affection but transformed in soul by our life’s seasons.Hear me, I can no longer be your friend only.Though Chrysale, Geronte, and Argante relive, you say, in me, I am not yet old enough to drink from the cup held to my lips by the sweet hands of a veiled woman without a passionate desire to tear off the domino and the mask and see the face.Either write me no more, or give me hope.Let me see you, or let me go.Must I bid you adieu?Will you permit me to sign myself,"
"您的朋友吗？","Your Friend?"
"致德卡那利先生：您多会奉承人啊！严肃的安塞尔姆这么快就变成帅气的赖昂德了！我应该把这一变化归于什么原因呢？归于我的白纸黑字吗？归于那些想法吗？那些想法之于我绽放的内心，就像炭笔画的玫瑰之于花园里真正的玫瑰。抑或是因为您想起了以为是我的那位少女？她的外表和我相比，就像是侍女之于女主人了。我们的角色互换了？我变得理智，您变得异想天开？但是好了，不开玩笑了。","To Monsieur de Canalis,—What flattery! with what rapidity is the grave Anselme transformed into a handsome Leander!To what must I attribute such a change? to this black which I put upon this white? to these ideas which are to the flowers of my soul what a rose drawn in charcoal is to the roses in the garden?Or is it to a recollection of the young girl whom you took for me, and who is personally as like me as a waiting-woman is like her mistress?Have we changed roles?Have I the sense? have you the fancy?But a truce with jesting."
"您的来信让我尝到了心灵的欣喜若狂，这是我第一次了解到除了家庭情感之外的快乐。一位诗人说过，比起那些神秘的感应在我们内心锻造出的神赐般的关系，这些常人心中如此强烈的血缘关系又算什么呢？让我感谢您吧——不，我们不能为这些事情而感谢彼此——但是，上帝会为您给我的幸福而保佑您的，您也为您带给我心灵的快乐而高兴吧。您向我解释了社会生活中一些明显的不公之处。有一种东西，我叫不上名字，它闪闪发光，刚健有力，是只属于男人的荣耀。上帝禁止我们女人戴上它的光环，但他让爱成为我们的命运，给了我们柔情来抚慰被他的光芒炙烤着的额头。我感觉到了我的使命，而您现在已确定了这使命。","Your letter has made me know the elating pleasures of the soul; the first that I have known outside of my family affections.What, says a poet, are the ties of blood which are so strong in ordinary minds, compared to those divinely forged within us by mysterious sympathies?Let me thank you—no, we must not thank each other for such things—but God bless you for the happiness you have given me; be happy in the joy you have shed into my soul.You explain to me some of the apparent injustices in social life.There is something, I know not what, so dazzling, so virile in glory, that it belongs only to man; God forbids us women to wear its halo, but he makes love our portion, giving us the tenderness which soothes the brow scorched by his lightnings.I have felt my mission, and you have now confirmed it."
"有时候，我的朋友，清晨时分我会怀着一种无以言表的甜蜜起床，一种温柔而神圣的宁静，让我仿佛置身天堂。我的第一个想法就像是祝福。我称这些早晨为我小小的德国式梦醒，与我那充满了英勇行动、战斗、罗马游乐会和热情诗歌的南方式日落形成了对照。好啦，读了您这封充满躁动不安的急切的来信，我觉得内心精神饱满，和每次置身天堂般的梦醒一模一样。每次那样醒来时，我都热爱着身边的空气和大自然，并幻想着我注定会为我心爱的人死去。您有一首诗——《少女之歌》，描绘了种种甜蜜的时刻，比如温柔的欢乐，迫切的愿望，这是我最喜欢的一首诗。您想要我把全部的恭维用一句话表达吗？——那好吧，我觉得您配得上我！","Sometimes, my friend, I rise in the morning in a state of inexpressible sweetness; a sort of peace, tender and divine, gives me an idea of heaven.My first thought is then like a benediction.I call these mornings my little German wakings, in opposition to my Southern sunsets, full of heroic deeds, battles, Roman fetes and ardent poems.Well, after reading your letter, so full of feverish impatience, I felt in my heart all the freshness of my celestial wakings, when I love the air about me and all nature, and fancy that I am destined to die for one I love.One of your poems, “The Maiden’s Song,” paints these delicious moments, when gaiety is tender, when aspiration is a need; it is one of my favorites.Do you want me to put all my flatteries into one?—well then, I think you worthy to be me!"
"您的信尽管很短，但能让我读到您的内心。是的，我已经猜到了您狂乱的挣扎，您被激起的好奇心，您的各种打算，但我对您还不够了解，也就不能满足您的愿望。听我说，亲爱的——正因为我身处神秘之中，才可以使用这个词，让您看到我的内心深处。听我说：一旦我们见面，我们彼此的了解就要结束了！您愿意与我立下一个约定吗？上次的约定让您吃亏了吗？但请您记住，它让您赢得了我的尊敬，而且，我的朋友，在赢得尊敬的同时您还赢得了钦佩，这是一个伟大的协议。以下是我们新的约定：用几句话跟我说说您的生活，然后告诉我您每天在巴黎做什么，不要有任何保留，就像是在跟某个老朋友聊天一样。好啦，您那样做了之后，我自己也会向前迈一步——我答应您，我会跟您见面。这是一个很好的协议。","Your letter, though short, enables me to read within you.Yes, I have guessed your tumultuous struggles, your piqued curiosity, your projects; but I do not yet know you well enough to satisfy your wishes.Hear me, dear; the mystery in which I am shrouded allows me to use that word, which lets you see to the bottom of my heart.Hear me: if we once meet, adieu to our mutual comprehension!Will you make a compact with me?Was the first disadvantageous to you?But remember it won you my esteem, and it is a great deal, my friend, to gain an admiration lined throughout with esteem.Here is the compact: write me your life in a few words; then tell me what you do in Paris, day by day, with no reservations, and as if you were talking to some old friend.Well, having done that, I will take a step myself—I will see you, I promise you that.And it is a great deal."
"亲爱的，这不是什么阴谋诡计，没有任何风险。而且，我要直白地警告您，不会有你们男人所说的风流韵事发生。它关系到我的一生，而且还不止如此——想到我的思绪成群地飞向您，我就感到有些自责——它还关系到我父亲和我母亲的一生。我深爱着他们，而且我的选择必须让他们高兴，他们应该在您身上找到儿子的感觉。","This, dear, is no intrigue, no adventure; no gallantry, as you men say, can come of it, I warn you frankly.It involves my life, and more than that,—something that causes me remorse for the many thoughts that fly to you in flocks—it involves my father’s and my mother’s life.I adore them, and my choice must please them; they must find a son in you."
"请告诉我，您那非凡的思想，上帝赋予了它天使的翅膀，却没能让它总是平易近人——它能在多大程度上屈从家庭的枷锁，忍受家庭生活中琐碎的烦心事呢？那是我已经思考过的一个主题。啊！尽管在走向您之前，我对自己的内心说：去吧！向前走吧！但我真正走向您的时候，我内心的颤抖和悸动并没有减少一分一毫；还有，我并没有回避必须面对的路途坎坷，还有攀登高山的艰难。我在长久长久的冥想中思考着所有的事情。像您这样的名人，一旦感受到爱情，便也深知您在对方心里激起的爱有多深。你们的生活中经历过许多次艳遇——尤其是您，您把心灵的柔情梦幻结集出版，让女人们争相购买。难道这一切我都不知道吗？然而，我还是对自己喊道：“前进吧！”因为我对人类伟大巅峰的地理研究，远远超过了您所料想的程度。您跟我说过，那巅峰是高处不胜寒的。您不是说过，歌德和拜伦是自我主义和诗情的两座巨像吗？啊，我的朋友，您也犯了一个思想肤浅的人们易犯的错误。但在您身上，这个错误也许是由于您的慷慨大度、故作谦虚，或者是想避开我的愿望吧。头脑庸俗的人可能会错把辛勤劳作的结果当作人格发展的产物，但您一定不能这样想。无论是拜伦爵士、歌德、瓦尔特·司各特、居维叶，还是任何的发明家，他们都不属于自己，而是其思想的奴隶。而且这种神秘的力量要比女人的嫉妒还厉害，它吮吸着他们的血液，它让他们继续存活，却让我们因它而死。这种隐秘的存在方式，其结果从形式上看很像自我主义。但若一个人放弃了自我，给他那个时代的人带来快乐、指引或者辉煌，有谁敢说他是一个自我主义者呢？当一位母亲把所有的东西都贡献给她的孩子时，她是自私的吗？好吧，只是那些贬低天才的人没有看到天才多产的母性罢了。诗人的生活就是要不断牺牲，以至于他需要一个强健的体魄来享有哪怕是生活中平凡的快乐。因此，当他像莫里哀那样，在生活中最为辛酸的危急关头想要过上感情生活的时候，他会陷入怎样的悲伤之中。对我来说，一想起莫里哀的私人生活，就感到他的喜剧多么可怕。","Tell me, to what extent can the superb spirits of your kind, to whom God has given the wings of his angels, without always adding their amiability,—how far can they bend under a family yoke, and put up with its little miseries?That is a text I have meditated upon.Ah! though I said to my heart before I came to you, Forward! Onward! it did not tremble and palpitate any the less on the way; and I did not conceal from myself the stoniness of the path nor the Alpine difficulties I had to encounter.I thought of all in my long, long meditations.Do I not know that eminent men like you have known the love they have inspired quite as well as that which they themselves have felt; that they have had many romances in their lives,—you particularly, who send forth those airy visions of your soul that women rush to buy?Yet still I cried to myself, “Onward!” because I have studied, more than you give me credit for, the geography of the great summits of humanity, which you tell me are so cold.Did you not say that Goethe and Byron were the colossi of egoism and poetry?Ah, my friend, there you shared a mistake into which superficial minds are apt to fall; but in you perhaps it came from generosity, false modesty, or the desire to escape from me.Vulgar minds may mistake the effect of toil for the development of personal character, but you must not.Neither Lord Byron, nor Goethe, nor Walter Scott, nor Cuvier, nor any inventor, belongs to himself, he is the slave of his idea.And this mysterious power is more jealous than a woman; it sucks their blood, it makes them live, it makes them die for its sake.The visible developments of their hidden existence do seem, in their results, like egotism; but who shall dare to say that the man who has abnegated self to give pleasure, instruction, or grandeur to his epoch, is an egoist?Is a mother selfish when she immolates all things to her child?Well, the detractors of genius do not perceive its fecund maternity, that is all.The life of a poet is so perpetual a sacrifice that he needs a gigantic organization to bear even the ordinary pleasures of life.Therefore, into what sorrows may he not fall when, like Moliere, he wishes to live the life of feeling in its most poignant crises; to me, remembering his personal life, Moliere’s comedy is horrible."
"天才的慷慨大方对我来说看上去近乎神圣，而我将您列入这所谓的自我主义者的高贵家族之中。啊！如果我发现我现在最爱的心灵之花，原来是一个自私自利、野心勃勃、冷酷无情之人，您不知道我将会忍受何等漫长的痛苦啊。我在十六岁之前就碰到过失望的事情。如果我在二十岁的时候领悟到名誉无非是谎言，发现一个人用他的作品表达出隐藏在我内心的情感、却不能自己感受这些情感，那我会怎么样呢？噢！我的朋友，您知道我会变成什么样吗？我带您进入到我心灵的幽深之处好吗？我本该去我父亲那儿，对他说：“给我找一个您中意的女婿吧，我放弃我的个人意愿——把我嫁给您中意的人吧。”而那个人可能会是一个公证人、银行家、守财奴、傻子、蠢蛋，像雨天一样令人讨厌，像经院的门房一样平庸，或是一个工厂主，一个有勇无谋的士兵——他会发现我是一个多么温顺体贴的仆人。但那是一场多么可怕的自杀啊！我的心灵就永远不会在心爱的阳光那让人生机勃勃的光芒下绽放。我不会向我的父亲、母亲或孩子透露这个女子的自杀。而此刻，她正抖落脚镣，从双眼中射出电光，拍着她那渴望的翅膀向您飞去。您看，她就在那儿，在您的书桌角上，像颂歌女神波吕许谟尼亚一样，呼吸着您周围的气息，用好奇的眼光打量着她身边的事物。有时候，我的丈夫会带我到田野里去散步，在那里，看到那辉煌壮丽的清晨，我会独自一人悄悄地抹眼泪。而且，在我的心底，或某个隐秘的抽屉里，我会保留一些珍宝，用来抚慰被爱情、悲伤、诗意的心灵所伤害的女孩——但是，啊！我有您，我相信您，我的朋友。那信任纠正了我所有的思绪和幻想，甚至是最不切实际的幻想，有时候——您看，我多坦率——我真希望我已经身处我们刚刚开始谱写的这本书之中了。我感觉自己的情感是如此坚定，我的内心充满了爱的力量，理智又让我如此忠贞不渝，我还有如此的英勇精神，去完成我出生之时就被赋予的义务——如果爱最终真的会变成义务。","The generosity of genius seems to me half divine; and I place you in this noble family of alleged egoists.Ah! if I had found self-interest, ambition, a seared nature where I now can see my best loved flowers of the soul, you know not what long anguish I should have had to bear.I met with disappointment before I was sixteen.What would have become of me had I learned at twenty that fame is a lie, that he whose books express the feelings hidden in my heart was incapable of feeling them himself?Oh! my friend, do you know what would have become of me?Shall I take you into the recesses of my soul?I should have gone to my father and said, “Bring me the son-inlaw whom you desire; my will abdicates,—marry me to whom you please.”And the man might have been a notary, banker, miser, fool, dullard, wearisome as a rainy day, common as the usher of a school, a manufacturer, or some brave soldier without two ideas,—he would have had a resigned and attentive servant in me.But what an awful suicide! never could my soul have expanded in the life-giving rays of a beloved sun.No murmur should have revealed to my father, or my mother, or my children the suicide of the creature who at this instant is shaking her fetters, casting lightnings from her eyes, and flying towards you with eager wing.See, she is there, at the angle of your desk, like Polyhymnia, breathing the air of your presence, and glancing about her with a curious eye.Sometimes in the fields where my husband would have taken me to walk, I should have wept, apart and secretly, at sight of a glorious morning; and in my heart, or hidden in a bureau-drawer, I might have kept some treasure, the comfort of poor girls ill-used by love, sad, poetic souls,—but ah!I have you, I believe in you, my friend.That belief straightens all my thoughts and fancies, even the most fantastic, and sometimes—see how far my frankness leads me—I wish I were in the middle of the book we are just beginning; such persistency do I feel in my sentiments, such strength in my heart to love, such constancy sustained by reason, such heroism for the duties for which I was created,—if indeed love can ever be transmuted into duty."
"如果您能跟我来到这华丽的隐居地——我幻想我们在这里是幸福的，如果您了解我的计划和打算，您会脱口说出“荒唐”这个可怕的词语，而我也会因给一个诗人写诗而受到残酷的惩罚。是的，过去二十年中，大自然让我生长在一片沃土之上，让我光彩照人，我希望成为一股泉水，像那片沃土那样取之不尽。我想用魅力来驱走厌腻。我愿意为我的朋友勇敢无畏，就像大部分女人为这个世界而勇敢无畏一样。我想把幸福变得多种多样。我想将智慧注入柔情之中，将情趣注入忠诚之中。我满怀雄心，要将过去的情敌都消灭掉，要用一个妻子的温柔，用她引以为豪的忘我精神来驱走所有外界的悲伤，终生照料我们的窝——就像鸟儿只能花上几个星期的时间去照料它们的窝一样。","If you were able to follow me to the exquisite retreat where I fancy ourselves happy, if you knew my plans and projects, the dreadful word “folly!” might escape you, and I should be cruelly punished for sending poetry to a poet.Yes, I wish to be a spring of waters inexhaustible as a fertile land for the twenty years that nature allows me to shine.I want to drive away satiety by charm.I mean to be courageous for my friend as most women are for the world.I wish to vary happiness.I wish to put intelligence into tenderness, and to give piquancy to fidelity.I am filled with ambition to kill the rivals of the past, to conjure away all outside griefs by a wife’s gentleness, by her proud abnegation, to take a lifelong care of the nest,—such as birds can only take for a few weeks."
"请告诉我，您现在还觉得我的第一封信该受责备吗？神秘的希望之风将我吹向了您，就像暴风雨将幼小的玫瑰树带到木窗户前一样。我将您的信捧在胸口，在您的信中，您像您的祖先参加十字军东征时那样呼喊道：“这是上帝的意愿。”","Tell me, do you now think me to blame for my first letter?The mysterious wind of will drove me to you, as the tempest brings the little rose-tree to the pollard window.In your letter, which I hold here upon my heart, you cried out, like your ancestor when he departed for the Crusades, “God wills it.”"
"啊！但您会喊道：“真是个话匣子！”可相反，我身边所有的人都说：“小姐真是沉默寡言。”","Ah! but you will cry out, “What a chatterbox!”All the people round me say, on the contrary, “Mademoiselle is very taciturn.”"
"欧·德埃斯特·莫。","O. d’Este M."
"第十一章 通信带来了什么","Chapter XI In What Comes of Correspondence"
"《人间喜剧》的作者从别人那里得到的上述信件，在那些人看来都是原创的，但是，他们对这种角逐、这种两人头脑之间的笔战的兴趣，可能不会被他人所认同。每一百个读者里面，可能有八十个都会对这种唇枪舌剑感到厌倦。在每一个立宪制的国家，都应该少数遵从多数，因此，我们不再透露埃内斯特和莫黛斯特在九月份写的另外十一封信了。如果以后，这大多数人当中有哪一位殷勤讨好，想看这些信，希望那时我们能想办法将它们安插到合适的地方去。","The foregoing letters seemed very original to the persons from whom the author of the “Comedy of Human Life” obtained them; but their interest in this duel, this crossing of pens between two minds, may not be shared.For every hundred readers, eighty might weary of the battle.The respect due to the majority in every nation under a constitutional government, leads us, therefore, to suppress eleven other letters exchanged between Ernest and Modeste during the month of September.If, later on, some flattering majority should arise to claim them, let us hope that we can then find means to insert them in their proper place."
"这个姑娘的心地很讨人喜欢，思想却很有锋芒。在这一思想的鼓舞下，这位可怜文书具有真正骑士风度的情感在这些隐匿的书信中得到了自由的表达。也许，这些信看上去要比实际更美好，因为人的想象会沉醉在两颗心灵自由交流的那种感觉之中。埃内斯特的整个生活现在都包裹在这些甜蜜的纸片之中，它们之于他，就像钞票之于守财奴。同时，在莫黛斯特心里，一种深深的爱代替了她扰乱一个名人生活的那种快乐，这种爱虽是远距离的，却仍成了她生活的重心。埃内斯特的心灵正好与卡那利的名气互补。唉！往往两个男人加起来才能成就一个完美的情人，就像在文学作品中，我们通过集合几个相似人物的特性来塑造一种典型人物。多少次，我们听到一个女人在自己的沙龙里进行亲密的交谈后说道：","Urged by a mind that seemed as aggressive as the heart was lovable, the truly chivalrous feelings of the poor secretary gave themselves free play in these suppressed letters, which seem, perhaps, more beautiful than they really are, because the imagination is charmed by a sense of the communion of two free souls.Ernest’s whole life was now wrapped up in these sweet scraps of paper; they were to him what banknotes are to a miser; while in Modeste’s soul a deep love took the place of her delight in agitating a glorious life, and being, in spite of distance, its mainspring.Ernest’s heart was the complement of Canalis’s glory.Alas! it often takes two men to make a perfect lover, just as in literature we compose a type by collecting the peculiarities of several similar characters.How many a time a woman has been heard to say in her own salon after close and intimate conversations:—"
"“这个人是我心灵的理想伴侣，而单从感官上讲，另一个人则是我的梦中情人。”","“Such a one is my ideal as to soul, and I love the other who is only a dream of the senses.”"
"下面是莫黛斯特写的最后一封信，它让我们一窥两位有情人通过这段曲折的通信之路到达的魔力之岛。","The last letter written by Modeste, which here follows, gives us a glimpse of the enchanted isle to which the meanderings of this correspondence had led the two lovers."
"致德卡那利先生：您下个星期天到勒阿弗尔来吧，去教堂。早礼拜之后，您就围着教堂中殿转上一两圈，然后走出去，不要跟任何人讲话，但请您在扣眼里别上一朵白玫瑰。之后就回巴黎去吧，您将在那里得到我的答复。我先跟您说好，我的答复不一定是您所期望的那样，因为，正如我跟你说过的，我对未来还没有把握。但如果还没有见过您，我就答应了您，那我岂不是真的疯了、傻了？在我见过您之后，我可以拒绝您而不伤害您，我可以肯定您不会看到我。","To Monsieur de Canalis,—Be at Havre next Sunday; go to church; after the morning service, walk once or twice round the nave, and go out without speaking to any one; but wear a white rose in your button-hole.Then return to Paris, where you shall receive an answer.I warn you that this answer will not be what you wish; for, as I told you, the future is not yet mine.But should I not indeed be mad and foolish to say yes without having seen you?When I have seen you I can say no without wounding you; I can make sure that you shall not see me."
"这封信是在迪迈和莫黛斯特之间那场无果的较量的前一天晚上送出去的。这位幸福的姑娘正焦急不安地等待着星期天，那天，她的双眼将对她的心灵和行为进行辩护，或者判罪——那是任何一个女人一生中的庄重时刻，三个月的心灵密切交流此刻变得如此浪漫，只有最有想象力的少女才能想象得到。每个人，除了她的母亲，都把这种因期待而表现出的迟钝麻木当作了天真无邪的平静。无论家规和宗教戒律有多么强有力的束缚，总会有克拉丽莎和朱莉那样的女孩，她们的心灵就像斟满的酒杯，在某种精神压力下酒便会溢出杯外。莫黛斯特出色地用她那原始的力量抑制着热情洋溢的青春活力，并保持着端庄的娴静。坦白说，对她而言，她姐姐的记忆比任何社会传统都有力得多。她有钢铁般的意志，决心不给她的父亲母亲带来任何悲伤。可她的内心却是怎样地跌宕起伏啊！怪不得一位母亲能揣测到这些。","This letter had been sent off the evening before the day when the abortive struggle between Dumay and Modeste had taken place.The happy girl was impatiently awaiting Sunday, when her eyes were to vindicate or condemn her heart and her actions,—a solemn moment in the life of any woman, and which three months of close communion of souls now rendered as romantic as the most imaginative maiden could have wished.Every one, except the mother, had taken this torpor of expectation for the calm of innocence.No matter how firmly family laws and religious precepts may bind, there will always be the Clarissas and the Julies, whose souls like flowing cups overlap the brim under some spiritual pressure.Modeste was glorious in the savage energy with which she repressed her exuberant youthful happiness and remained demurely quiet.Let us say frankly that the memory of her sister was more potent upon her than any social conventions; her will was iron in the resolve to bring no grief upon her father and her mother.But what tumultuous heavings were within her breast! no wonder that a mother guessed them."
"第二天，大约中午的时候，莫黛斯特和迪迈夫人带着米尼翁夫人，坐在花丛中的一条凳子上晒太阳。这位失明的女人将她苍白憔悴的脸转向大海，她呼吸着大海的气息，抓住她身边的女儿的手。盘问女儿之前，母亲在原谅和规劝之间犹豫不决，因为她理解少女的爱情，而且跟那位冒牌的卡那利一样，她也觉得莫黛斯特的天性与众不同。","On the following day Modeste and Madame Dumay took Madame Mignon about mid-day to a seat in the sun among the flowers.The blind woman turned her wan and blighted face toward the ocean; she inhaled the odors of the sea and took the hand of her daughter who remained beside her.The mother hesitated between forgiveness and remonstrance ere she put the important question; for she comprehended the girl’s love and recognized, as the pretended Canalis had done, that Modeste was exceptional in nature."
"“上帝保佑你父亲能及时回来！如果他耽搁太久，就只剩下你一个人爱他了。莫黛斯特，再一次答应我，永远都不要离开他。”她用一个母亲宠爱的口吻说道。","“God grant that your father return in time!If he delays much longer he will find none but you to love him.Modeste, promise me once more never to leave him,” she said in a fond maternal tone."
"莫黛斯特把母亲的双手托到自己唇边，轻轻亲吻它们，并回答道：“需要我再说一遍吗？”","Modeste lifted her mother’s hands to her lips and kissed them gently, replying: “Need I say it again?”"
"“啊，我的孩子！是我自己要求你这样做的。我离开了我的父亲，跟随我的丈夫，而我的父亲却孤身一人，我是她唯一的孩子。因为这一点，上帝才如此惩罚我吗？我对你的要求就是按照你父亲的心愿嫁人，从内心里珍爱他，不要为了你自己的幸福牺牲他，要把他当作你家庭的中心。在我失明前，我把我的全部遗嘱写给了他，我知道他会实现它们的。我嘱咐他把财产完整地保留在自己手里，不是说我不信任你，等等，我的莫黛斯特，但是谁能信任一位女婿呢？啊！我的女儿，看着我，我说得有道理吗？一瞥青睐便定我终身。美貌总是骗人的东西，对我而言这是实话，但在你身上甚至也是同样。我可怜的孩子，向我发誓，你会让你的父亲打探清楚你所爱的人——如果碰巧真有这样一个男人的话，看看他的品性、习惯、内心，以及他以往的生活。”","“Ah, my child!I did this thing myself.I left my father to follow my husband; and yet my father was all alone; I was all the child he had.Is that why God has so punished me?What I ask of you is to marry as your father wishes, to cherish him in your heart, not to sacrifice him to your own happiness, but to make him the centre of your home.Before losing my sight, I wrote him all my wishes, and I know he will execute them.I enjoined him to keep his property intact and in his own hands; not that I distrust you, my Modeste, for a moment, but who can be sure of a son-inlaw?Ah! my daughter, look at me; was I reasonable?One glance of the eye decided my life.Beauty, so often deceitful, in my case spoke true; but even were it the same with you, my poor child, swear to me that you will let your father inquire into the character, the habits, the heart, and the previous life of the man you distinguish with your love—if, by chance, there is such a man.”"
"“没有父亲的同意，我永远都不会结婚。”莫黛斯特回答道。","“I will never marry without the consent of my father,” answered Modeste."
"“你明白吧，我的宝贝儿，”沉默良久之后，米尼翁夫人说，“如果说是贝蒂娜的过错让我慢慢死去，那么你要是再犯错的话，你的父亲将无法再活下去，不会的，一刻都不会。我了解他，他会朝自己的脑袋开一枪——对他来说，人间将不会再有生趣和幸福了。”","“You see, my darling,” said Madame Mignon after a long pause, “that if I am dying by inches through Bettina’s wrong-doing, your father would not survive yours, no, not for a moment.I know him; he would put a pistol to his head,—there could be no life, no happiness on earth for him.”"
"莫黛斯特从母亲身边走开，但走了几步又马上回来了。","Modeste walked a few steps away from her mother, but immediately came back."
"“你刚刚为什么走开呢？”米尼翁夫人问道。","“Why did you leave me?” demanded Madame Mignon."
"“妈妈，您把我弄哭了。”莫黛斯特回答说。","“You made me cry, mamma,” answered Modeste."
"“啊，我的小宝贝儿，亲我一下。你在这儿没有爱上谁吧？你没有情人的，对吧？”她贴心地问道，并让莫黛斯特坐在她的膝上。","“Ah, my little darling, kiss me.You love no one here? you have no lover, have you?” she asked, holding Modeste on her lap, heart to heart."
"“没有，我亲爱的妈妈，”这个小精怪说。","“No, my dear mamma,” said the little Jesuit."
"“你能发誓吗？”","“Can you swear it?”"
"“哎呀，能啊！”莫黛斯特叫道。","“Oh, yes!” cried Modeste."
"米尼翁夫人不再说什么了，但她还是怀疑。","Madame Mignon said no more; but she still doubted."
"“如果你要选择丈夫，你至少会告诉你父亲的吧？”她又说道。","“At least, if you do choose your husband, you will tell your father?” she resumed."
"“我答应了姐姐，也答应了你，母亲。我手上戴的戒指刻有‘想想贝蒂娜’这几个字，你认为我还会犯下什么错呢？可怜的姐姐！”","“I promised that to my sister, and to you, mother.What evil do you think I could commit while I wear that ring upon my finger and read those words: ‘Think of Bettina?’Poor sister!”"
"说完这些话，这对母女都沉默了。母亲失明的双眼噙着泪水，莫黛斯特也不能让这泪水止住，尽管她已跪在母亲身边，哭道：“原谅我吧！唉，原谅我吧，母亲！”","At these words a truce of silence came between the pair; the mother’s blighted eyes rained tears which Modeste could not check, though she threw herself upon her knees, and cried: “Forgive me! oh, forgive me, mother!”"
"此时此刻，能干的迪迈正快步朝安古维尔山上走来——这在这位账房总管的日常生活中实属反常之举。","At this instant the excellent Dumay was coming up the hill of Ingouville on the double-quick,—a fact quite abnormal in the present life of the cashier."
"从前，三封来信给米尼翁家族带来了破产之灾，如今，一封来信又带回了他们的好运。迪迈刚刚收到一封从中国海域回来的航海船长带来的信，第一次得到了他的东家和朋友夏尔·米尼翁的消息：","Three letters had brought ruin to the Mignons; a single letter now restored their fortunes.Dumay had received from a sea-captain just arrived from the China Seas the following letter containing the first news of his patron and friend, Charles Mignon:—"
"致让·迪迈先生：","To Monsieur Jean Dumay:"
"我亲爱的迪迈——继给你带去这封信的那艘船之后，我也将很快回来，除非航行中有什么变故。事实上，我本应该坐上这艘船，但我不想离开自己的船，我已经习惯了自己的船。","My Dear Dumay,—I shall quickly follow, barring the chances of the voyage, the vessel which carries this letter.In fact, I should have taken it, but I did not wish to leave my own ship to which I am accustomed."
"我跟你说过，没有消息就是好消息。但这封信开头的话应该能令你高兴。我至少赚了七百万。我将这些财产带回，大部分是靛蓝染料，三分之一是可靠的伦敦有价证券，还有三分之一是十足的纯金子。在你汇款的帮助下，我很快赚到了我头脑里预定的金额，比我预想中快得多。我想挣到两百万，给我女儿，也保证自己生活舒适。","I told you that no new was to be good news.But the first words of this letter ought to make you a happy man.I have made seven millions at the least.I am bringing back a large part of it in indigo, one third in safe London securities, and another third in good solid gold.Your remittances helped me to make the sum I had settled in my own mind much sooner than I expected.I wanted two millions for my daughters and a competence for myself."
"我跟广州最大的那些商号做鸦片买卖，所有这些商号都要比我富上十倍。你在欧洲没法想象这些富有的东印度商人是什么样。我去了小亚细亚，低价购得鸦片，然后就去了广州，把货转卖给操纵这一行的公司。我最后一次远航是去菲律宾群岛，在那儿，我用鸦片换取了上等的靛蓝染料。事实上，我可能比我说的还多赚了五十万，因为我在给靛蓝染料估价时，只算了成本。我身体一直都很好，一点儿小病都没有。这是因为，我在为自己的孩子们工作。第二年起，我就有了一艘载重七百吨的漂亮的小双桅船，船名就叫“米尼翁号”。船是橡木制成的，双层板，由铜钉固定，所有的内部设施也根据我的需要进行了改造。其实，她也是一笔额外的财产。","I have been engaged in the opium trade with the largest houses in Canton, all ten times richer than ever I was.You have no idea, in Europe, what these rich East India merchants are.I went to Asia Minor and purchased opium at low prices, and from thence to Canton where I delivered my cargoes to the companies who control the trade.My last expedition was to the Philippine Islands where I exchanged opium for indigo of the first quality.In fact, I may have half a million more than I stated, for I reckoned the indigo at what it cost me.I have always been well in health; not the slightest illness.That is the result of working for one’s children.Since the second year I have owned a pretty little brig of seven hundred tons, called the “Mignon.”She is built of oak, double-planked, and copper-fastened; and all the interior fittings were done to suit me.She is, in fact, an additional piece of property."
"海上生活，加上生意需要养成的勤劳习惯，让我保持了健康的体魄。告诉你这一切，跟告诉我的两个女儿和亲爱的妻子是一样的。我想，那个拐走我的贝蒂娜的可恶家伙肯定在得知我破产后便抛弃了她，而我将在木屋见到我那可怜的迷途羔羊。我三个亲爱的女人和我的迪迈！在过去的三年里，我无时无刻不想着你们四个人。现在，你是一个富人了，迪迈。除去我自己的财产，你的股份总计达五十六万法郎，因此我随信给你汇了一张支票，请你亲自带着它去蒙日诺银号兑现，我在纽约就跟他们充分交待过了。","A sea-life and the active habits required by my business have kept me in good health.To tell you all this is the same as telling it to my two daughters and my dear wife.I trust that the wretched man who took away my Bettina deserted her when he heard of my ruin; and that I shall find the poor lost lamb at the Chalet.My three dear women and my Dumay!All four of you have been ever present in my thoughts for the last three years.You are a rich man, now, Dumay.Your share, outside of my own fortune, amounts to five hundred and sixty thousand francs, for which I send you herewith a check, which can only be paid to you in person by the Mongenods, who have been duly advised from New York."
"短短的几个月之后，我就会再次见到你们所有人，所有人都会好好的，我相信。我亲爱的迪迈，我给你写这封信，是因为我希望暂时将我的财产保密。因此，我相信你会乐意为我亲爱的天使们做好准备，迎接我的归来。我已经厌倦了经商，而且决定离开勒阿弗尔。我想赎回拉巴斯蒂庄园，并限定其继承权，这样便有了一份每年至少收入一万法郎的不动产。然后，我会去请求国王，准许我的一位女婿继承我的姓氏和头衔。你知道的，我可怜的迪迈，家财万贯的致命名声给我们带来了多么可怕的不幸——我一个女儿的声誉因此失去了。所以，我决心不让别人知道我现在拥有的财产。我不会在勒阿弗尔登岸，而是在马赛。我会通过在巴黎的蒙日诺商号将靛蓝卖掉，并商量赎回拉巴斯蒂庄园。我会把钱存到法兰西银行，然后回到木屋，对外只说我有大笔钱压在货物上。人们会以为我的女儿们只有二十到三十万法郎的财产。现在，我生活的目标就是选择值得继承我的头衔和地产、并同我们一起生活的女婿。但是，两个女婿都得像你我一样，正直、忠诚、可靠，而且要绝对地值得尊敬。","A few short months, and I shall see you all again, and all well, I trust.My dear Dumay, if I write this letter to you it is because I am anxious to keep my fortune a secret for the present.I therefore leave to you the happiness of preparing my dear angels for my return.I have had enough of commerce; and I am resolved to leave Havre.My intention is to buy back the estate of La Bastie, and to entail it, so as to establish an estate yielding at least a hundred thousand francs a year, and then to ask the king to grant that one of my sons-inlaw may succeed to my name and title.You know, my poor Dumay, what a terrible misfortune overtook us through the fatal reputation of a large fortune,—my daughter’s honor was lost.I have therefore resolved that the amount of my present fortune shall not be known.I shall not disembark at Havre, but at Marseilles.I shall sell my indigo, and negotiate for the purchase of La Bastie through the house of Mongenod in Paris.I shall put my funds in the Bank of France and return to the Chalet giving out that I have a considerable fortune in merchandise.My daughters will be supposed to have two or three hundred thousand francs.To choose which of my sons-inlaw is worthy to succeed to my title and estates and to live with us, is now the object of my life; but both of them must be, like you and me, honest, loyal, and firm men, and absolutely honorable."
"我亲爱的老朋友，我一刻都没有怀疑过你。我们一起打过仗，也一起经过商，而现在，我们将一起务农，你就是我的管家。你会乐意那样做，对吗？所以，老朋友，我想由你自行决定，对我的妻子和女儿而言什么是最好的，我信赖你的审慎。四年了，她们的性格可能已发生了很大的变化。","My dear old fellow, I have never doubted you for a moment.We have gone through wars and commerce together and now we will undertake agriculture; you shall be my bailiff.You will like that, will you not?And so, old friend, I leave it to your discretion to tell what you think best to my wife and daughters; I rely upon your prudence.In four years great changes may have taken place in their characters."
"再见吧，我的老朋友迪迈。转告我的妻子和女儿们，从我离开她们起，我从未忘记每天早晚在我的脑海里亲吻她们。随信所寄的第二张四十万法郎的支票是给我的妻子和孩子们的。","Adieu, my old Dumay.Say to my daughters and to my wife that I have never failed to kiss them in my thoughts morning and evening since I left them.The second check for forty thousand francs herewith enclosed is for my wife and children."
"等着我们见面吧——","Till we meet.—"
"你的中校和朋友，","Your colonel and friend,"
"夏尔·米尼翁。","Charles Mignon."
"“你的父亲要回来了。”米尼翁夫人对她的女儿说道。","“Your father is coming,” said Madame Mignon to her daughter."
"“您为什么这么认为呢，妈妈？”莫黛斯特问。","“What makes you think so, mamma?” asked Modeste."
"“没有其他事情能让迪迈这么匆忙。”","“Nothing else could make Dumay hurry himself.”"
"“胜利了！胜利了！”中尉一到花园门口就喊道，“夫人，中校一刻都没生过病，他要回来了——乘着‘米尼翁号’，那是一艘他自己的船，很漂亮，他跟我说，加上船上的货物，一共价值八、九十万法郎。但他要我们所有人保密，他的心仍在为我们死去的亲爱女孩那不幸的遭遇而绞痛。”","“Victory! victory!” cried the lieutenant as soon as he reached the garden gate.“Madame, the colonel has not been ill a moment; he is coming back—coming back on the ‘Mignon,’ a fine ship of his own, which together with its cargo is worth, he tells me, eight or nine hundred thousand francs.But he requires secrecy from all of us; his heart is still wrung by the misfortunes of our dear departed girl.”"
"“他还不知道她已经去世了呢。”米尼翁夫人说道。","“He has still to learn her death,” said Madame Mignon."
"“他把小姐的不幸归为年轻人对于大笔财富的贪婪，我想他是对的。我可怜的中校还希望能在这儿找回那迷失的羔羊呢。我们只要自己高兴就好了，不要跟任何人说，如果可能的话，甚至连拉图奈尔也不要说。小姐，”他在莫黛斯特的耳边小声说道，“给你父亲写信，告诉他你姐姐过世的消息，以及此事给你母亲的健康和视力带来的可怕后果，让他为不得不面对的打击做好准备。在他回到勒阿弗尔之前，我将负责把信送到他手里，因为他路上会经过巴黎。给他写一封长信，你有足够的时间。我会在星期一来拿信，星期一我很可能会去巴黎。”","“He attributes her disaster, and I think he is right, to the rapacity of young men after great fortunes.My poor colonel expects to find the lost sheep here.Let us be happy among ourselves but say nothing to any one, not even to Latournelle, if that is possible.Mademoiselle,” he whispered in Modeste’s ear, “write to your father and tell him of his loss and also the terrible results on your mother’s health and eyesight; prepare him for the shock he has to meet.I will engage to get the letter into his hands before he reaches Havre, for he will have to pass through Paris on his way.Write him a long letter; you have plenty of time.I will take the letter on Monday; Monday I shall probably go to Paris.”"
"莫黛斯特很担心卡那利会和迪迈碰上，便急忙往屋里走，想给她的诗人写信推迟约会。","Modeste was so afraid that Canalis and Dumay would meet that she started hastily for the house to write to her poet and put off the rendezvous."
"“小姐，”迪迈挡住了莫黛斯特的去路，以一种十分谦卑的态度说道，“希望你的父亲能看到，他女儿的内心除了在他被迫离开之前对他和母亲的那些情感，再没有其他情感了。”","“Mademoiselle,” said Dumay, in a very humble manner and barring Modeste’s way, “may your father find his daughter with no other feelings in her heart than those she had for him and for her mother before he was obliged to leave her.”"
"“我已经对自己、对我的姐姐、对我的母亲发誓，要成为我父亲的快乐、安慰和光荣，我会信守诺言的！”莫黛斯特傲慢而轻蔑地看了迪迈一眼，回答道，“请不要用侮辱性的怀疑破坏我想到父亲要回来的快乐。您不能阻止一个少女的心脏跳动——您不想让我成为一具僵尸，对吧？”她说道，“我的手属于我的家庭，但我的心是我自己的。如果我爱上了某个人，我的父亲母亲会知道的。这样您满意了吗，先生？”","“I have sworn to myself, to my sister, and to my mother to be the joy, the consolation, and the glory of my father, and I shall keep my oath!” replied Modeste with a haughty and disdainful glance at Dumay.“Do not trouble my delight in the thought of my father’s return with insulting suspicions.You cannot prevent a girl’s heart from beating—you don’t want me to be a mummy, do you?” she said.“My hand belongs to my family, but my heart is my own.If I love any one, my father and my mother will know it.Does that satisfy you, monsieur?”"
"“谢谢您，小姐，您算是让我捡回了这条命，”迪迈说，“但就算您扇我耳光，您还是可以叫我迪迈。”","“Thank you, mademoiselle; you restore me to life,” said Dumay, “but you might still call me Dumay, even when you box my ears!”"
"“向我发誓，”她母亲说，“你没有跟任何一个年轻男子说过一句话，或交换过一个眼神。”","“Swear to me,” said her mother, “that you have not engaged a word or a look with any young man.”"
"“我可以发誓，我亲爱的妈妈，”莫黛斯特看着迪迈，笑着说道。迪迈正看着她，像个调皮的女孩那样会意一笑。","“I can swear that, my dear mother,” said Modeste, laughing, and looking at Dumay who was watching her and smiling to himself like a mischievous girl."
"“如果您真的说对了，那她肯定在伪装。”莫黛斯特离开他们走进屋子后，迪迈大声说道。","“She must be false indeed if you are right,” cried Dumay, when Modeste had left them and gone into the house."
"“我的女儿莫黛斯特可能会有缺点，”她母亲说，“但说谎不会是她的缺点之一，她不会说假话。”","“My daughter Modeste may have faults,” said her mother, “but falsehood is not one of them; she is incapable of saying what is not true.”"
"“好吧！那就让我们放轻松些吧，”迪迈接着说，“相信厄运已经同我们结账了吧。”","“Well! then let us feel easy,” continued Dumay, “and believe that misfortune has closed his account with us.”"
"“上帝也是这样认为的！”米尼翁夫人回答道，“迪迈，你将见到他，但我将只能听到他说话了。我的快乐里有许多伤感。”","“God grant it!” answered Madame Mignon.“You will see him, Dumay; but I shall only hear him.There is much of sadness in my joy.”"
"第十二章 爱之宣言——音乐响起","Chapter XII A Declaration of Love, —Set to Music"
"此刻，虽然莫黛斯特为她父亲的归来感到高兴，但她却在房间里忧郁地踱着步，就像佩雷特看到她的鸡蛋被打碎了一样。她本希望她的父亲能带回比迪迈所说的多得多的财产。在她的第二封信里，她说自己身价六百万，所以，至少得有个三百万，才能满足她为了她的诗人重新燃气的雄心。她的双重快乐，加上相对困窘的境况所导致的悲伤，令她焦灼不已。她坐到钢琴边，那是许多少女的知己，她们在琴键上倾诉自己的愿望和愤怒，通过音符和曲调来表达它们。迪迈正在窗下的花园里跟他妻子谈话，把他们自己财产的秘密告诉她，并问她有什么愿望和打算。迪迈夫人跟她丈夫一样，除了米尼翁一家之外，没有其他亲人了。于是，夫妻俩达成一致，如果德拉巴斯蒂伯爵真的打算到普罗旺斯去住，那他们也搬到那里去，并且把他们的财产留给莫黛斯特的孩子当中最需要这笔钱的那一个。","At this moment Modeste, happy as she was in the return of her father, was, nevertheless, pacing her room disconsolate as Perrette on seeing her eggs broken.She had hoped her father would bring back a much larger fortune than Dumay had mentioned.Nothing could satisfy her new-found ambition on behalf of her poet less than at least half the six millions she had talked of in her second letter.Trebly agitated by her two joys and the grief caused by her comparative poverty, she seated herself at the piano, that confidant of so many young girls, who tell out their wishes and provocations on the keys, expressing them by the notes and tones of their music.Dumay was talking with his wife in the garden under the windows, telling her the secret of their own wealth, and questioning her as to her desires and her intentions.Madame Dumay had, like her husband, no other family than the Mignons.Husband and wife agreed, therefore, to go and live in Provence, if the Comte de La Bastie really meant to live in Provence, and to leave their money to whichever of Modeste’s children might need it most."
"“听莫黛斯特的琴声，”米尼翁夫人对他们说道，“除了恋爱中的女孩，再没有哪个没学过音乐的人能谱出这样的旋律。”","“Listen to Modeste,” said Madame Mignon, addressing them.“None but a girl in love can compose such airs without having studied music.”"
"房屋可以烧毁，财产可以被吞没，父亲可以从远方归来，帝国可以衰落，霍乱可以毁灭城市，但是，一位少女的爱情可以继续飞翔，就像大自然循环往复，或者就像化学家近来发现的那种可怕的酸性物质，如果没有什么阻止它的话，它不久就会把地球蚀穿。","Houses may burn, fortunes be engulfed, fathers return from distant lands, empires may crumble away, the cholera may ravage cities, but a maiden’s love wings its way as nature pursues hers, or that alarming acid which chemistry has lately discovered, and which will presently eat through the globe, if nothing stops it."
"在当前处境带给她的灵感之下，莫黛斯特给她的音乐加入了一些诗节，我们这里不得不提到它们——尽管它们已被收录到多里亚提到的卡那利诗集第二卷里——因为，为了使这些诗节能配合她的音乐，那如同伟大歌手的歌声一样、充满无以言表的感情魅力的音乐，莫黛斯特信手修改了它们，这种随意的修改方式可能会让卡那利的崇拜者们大吃一惊，因为他们的诗人是以精于修饰著称的，有时甚至精细得有点过头。","Modeste, under the inspiration of her present situation, was putting to music certain stanzas which we are compelled to quote here—albeit they are printed in the second volume of the edition Dauriat had mentioned—because, in order to adapt them to her music, which had the inexpressible charm of sentiment so admired in great singers, Modeste had taken liberties with the lines in a manner that may astonish the admirers of a poet so famous for the correctness, sometimes too precise, of his measures."
"少女之歌","THE MAIDEN’S SONG"
"起来吧，你听！云雀正拍动着洒满阳光的翅膀，朝天堂飞去，不要再沉睡了，紫罗兰醒了，她的芬芳飘向空中。花儿复苏了，它们睁开双眼，看到点点露珠，休憩在每一盏银杯般的花萼中，那是一天中它们的明镜。玫瑰花神，乘着天上的微风，在夜晚降临，保佑花儿盛开。你看！每颗花蕾都为他而绽放，流光溢彩，散发出浓郁的芳香。","Hear, arise! the lark is shakingSunlit wings that heavenward rise; Sleep no more; the violet, waking, Wafts her incense to the skies.Flowers revived, their eyes unclosing, See themselves in drops of dewIn each calyx-cup reposing, Pearls of a day their mirror true.Breeze divine, the god of roses, Passed by night to bless their bloom;See! for him each bud uncloses,Glows, and yields its rich perfume."
"那么，醒来吧！云雀正拍着洒满阳光的翅膀飞向天堂，不再沉睡了——我的心，醒来吧，把你的芬芳抛向天堂吧。","Then arise! the lark is shakingSunlit wings that heavenward rise; Nought is sleeping—Heart, awaking,Lift thine incense to the skies."
"“太美了，”迪迈夫人说，“莫黛斯特是个音乐家，这首歌就是全部证明。”","“It is very pretty,” said Madame Dumay.“Modeste is a musician, and that’s the whole of it.”"
"“她着魔了！”账房总管喊道。那位母亲的怀疑钻进了他心里，令他不寒而栗。","“The devil is in her!” cried the cashier, into whose heart the suspicion of the mother forced its way and made him shiver."
"“她恋爱了。”米尼翁夫人坚持道。","“She loves,” persisted Madame Mignon."
"通过这不可否认的歌曲的证据，米尼翁夫人成功地让这位账房总管接受了她自己的想法，那就是莫黛斯特恋爱了。对迪迈来说，这破坏了他主人的归来以及生意兴隆带给他的快乐。这位可怜的布列塔尼人走下山，回到勒阿弗尔，带着一颗沉重的心坐到哥本海姆账房里他的桌子旁。然后，在回家吃晚饭之前，他去找了拉图奈尔，告诉他自己的担忧，并再一次请求这位公证人的建议和帮助。","By succeeding, through the undeniable testimony of the song, in making the cashier a sharer in her belief as to the state of Modeste’s heart, Madame Mignon destroyed the happiness the return and the prosperity of his master had brought him.The poor Breton went down the hill to Havre and to his desk in Gobenheim’s counting-room with a heavy heart; then, before returning to dinner, he went to see Latournelle, to tell his fears, and beg once more for the notary’s advice and assistance."
"“是的，我亲爱的朋友，”在公证人家门口的台阶上分别时，迪迈说道，“我现在同意夫人的看法了，莫黛斯特恋爱了——是的，我确定，而其他情况只有鬼晓得。我真是蒙羞了。”","“Yes, my dear friend,” said Dumay, when they parted on the steps of the notary’s door, “I now agree with madame; she loves,—yes, I am sure of it; and the devil knows the rest.I am dishonored.”"
"“别让自己不高兴，迪迈，”小个子公证人回答说，“我们所有人加在一起，肯定能胜过一个小姑娘。每一个恋爱的姑娘迟早都会暴露自己——这一点你可以肯定。不过我们今天晚上还是商量一下此事吧。”","“Don’t make yourself unhappy, Dumay,” answered the little notary.“Among us all we can surely get the better of the little puss; sooner or later, every girl in love betrays herself,—you may be sure of that.But we will talk about it this evening.”"
"于是，所有对米尼翁家族忠心耿耿的人，又完全回到了老兵迪迈尝试那个他本以为会有决定性效果的实验之前的状态，变得惴惴不安、毫无把握了。上次努力的失败大大刺激了迪迈的责任心，以至于他决定先猜透莫黛斯特心中的谜，再按主人的吩咐到巴黎去料理他的财产。对这些朋友来说，感情要比利益宝贵得多，他们很清楚地知道，除非中校的女儿还是纯洁清白的，不然这位父亲回来时知道贝蒂娜死了、妻子瞎了，会伤心而死的。可怜的迪迈的苦恼不堪，而这也给拉图奈尔一家人带来了影响，以至于他们都忘了离别之痛——埃克絮佩当天上午刚刚出发前往巴黎。晚饭期间，拉图奈尔夫妇和比查单独在一起时，他们把这个问题在脑子里反复琢磨了好多遍，并就其中的每一方面进行了探讨。","Thus it happened that all those devoted to the Mignon family were fully as disquieted and uncertain as they were before the old soldier tried the experiment which he expected would be so decisive.The ill-success of his past efforts so stimulated Dumay’s sense of duty, that he determined not to go to Paris to see after his own fortune as announced by his patron, until he had guessed the riddle of Modeste’s heart.These friends, to whom feelings were more precious than interests, well knew that unless the daughter were pure and innocent, the father would die of grief when he came to know the death of Bettina and the blindness of his wife.The distress of poor Dumay made such an impression on the Latournelles that they even forgot their parting with Exupere, whom they had sent off that morning to Paris.During dinner, while the three were alone, Monsieur and Madame Latournelle and Butscha turned the problem over and over in their minds, and discussed every aspect of it."
"“如果莫黛斯特爱上的是勒阿弗尔的一个人，那她昨天就该表现出一些害怕了，”拉图奈尔夫人说，“因此，她的情人住在其他地方。”","“If Modeste loved any one in Havre she would have shown some fear yesterday,” said Madame Latournelle; “her lover, therefore, lives somewhere else.”"
"“她今天早晨对她母亲发誓了，”公证人说，“当着迪迈的面，说她没有跟任何一个活人交换过一个眼神，或是说过一句话。”","“She swore to her mother this morning,” said the notary, “in presence of Dumay, that she had not exchanged a look or a word with any living soul.”"
"“那她跟我的恋爱方式一样了！”比查喊道。","“Then she loves after my fashion!” exclaimed Butscha."
"“那是什么样的恋爱方式呀，我可怜的小伙子？”拉图奈尔夫人问道。","“And how is that, my poor lad?” asked Madame Latournelle."
"“夫人，”小瘸子说，“我是远距离单相思——唉！差不多有从这里到星空那么遥远。”","“Madame,” said the little cripple, “I love alone and afar—oh! as far as from here to the stars.”"
"“你是怎么做到的，你这个傻小子？”拉图奈尔夫人笑着说。","“How do you manage it, you silly fellow?” said Madame Latournelle, laughing."
"“啊，夫人！”比查说，“我背上被你们称为鼓包的东西，其实是我翅膀的插孔。”","“Ah, madame!” said Butscha, “what you call my hump is the socket of my wings.”"
"“这就解释了你的印章，对吗？”公证人叫道。","“So that is the explanation of your seal, is it?” cried the notary."
"比查的印章是一颗星星，下面有这么一行字：“闪闪发光的人啊——我跟随你。”——这是沙蒂约内家族的座右铭。","Butscha’s seal was a star, and under it the words “Fulgens, sequar,”—“Shining One, I follow thee,”—the motto of the house of Chastillonest."
"“一个漂亮女人可能跟最丑的女人一样，不信任任何人，”比查自言自语般地说道，“莫黛斯特相当聪明，她害怕别人仅仅因为她的美貌才爱上她。”","“A beautiful woman may feel as distrustful as the ugliest,” said Butscha, as if speaking to himself; “Modeste is clever enough to fear she may be loved only for her beauty.”"
"驼子都是了不起的人，这完全是社会造成的，因为根据大自然的设计，弱者或是发育不全的人就应该毁灭。脊柱的弯曲或扭曲，使这些外表残疾的人像一枚枚蓄电池，积累了比正常人更丰富的神经流——他们因此逐步成长，并且可以说是迸发光芒，给内心带来能量。由此产生的力量，有时会通过磁力被人们发现，而更多的情况下，它们只是消失在精神世界的模糊空间里。畸形人往往具有某种特殊的才能——有可能是某种古灵精怪或机智活泼的欢乐精神，有可能是一种十足的恶毒，也有可能是一种近乎崇高的善良。这些生命，就像永远无法被艺术之手完全唤醒的乐器，具有得天独厚的优势，尽管他们自己并不知道这一点。正如比查那样，为了活下去，他们必须跟各种巨大的障碍作斗争。假如他们身上如此集中的自然力量没有在斗争中耗尽，那他们就会生活在自己的内心世界里。这解释了许多迷信、土地神的民间传说、吓人的小矮人、丑陋的精灵——正如拉伯雷所说，它们都是从盛有万灵药和珍贵香膏的瓶子里出来的异族。","Hunchbacks are extraordinary creations, due entirely to society for, according to Nature’s plan, feeble or aborted beings ought to perish.The curvature or distortion of the spinal column creates in these outwardly deformed subjects as it were a storage-battery, where the nerve currents accumulate more abundantly than under normal conditions,—where they develop, and whence they are emitted, so to say, in lightning flashes, to energize the interior being.From this, forces result which are sometimes brought to light by magnetism, though they are far more frequently lost in the vague spaces of the spiritual world.It is rare to find a deformed person who is not gifted with some special faculty,—a whimsical or sparkling gaiety perhaps, an utter malignity, or an almost sublime goodness.Like instruments which the hand of art can never fully waken, these beings, highly privileged though they know it not, live within themselves, as Butscha lived, provided their natural forces so magnificently concentrated have not been spent in the struggle they have been forced to maintain, against tremendous odds, to keep alive.This explains many superstitions, the popular legends of gnomes, frightful dwarfs, deformed fairies,—all that race of bottles, as Rabelais called them, containing elixirs and precious balms."
"因此，比查几乎已经找到了谜团的钥匙。他是一个无望的情人，一个时刻准备牺牲的仆人——就像独自被抛弃在俄国雪地中的士兵仍高呼“帝国万岁”一样——他忧心忡忡，琢磨着怎样凭自己的学识去探清莫黛斯特的秘密。那天晚上，他心中怀着这些想法，跟着他的两位主人去了木屋别墅，眉宇间心事重重的样子。因为他要设下陷阱探清他的小姐的秘密，但无论是怎样的陷阱，他知道最重要的是要避开这些警惕的眼睛和耳朵。他想，关键应该是截取某个眼神，抓到某种突然的举动或轻微的颤抖，就像外科医生用手指捕捉一个看不见的痛处一样。那天晚上哥本海姆没来，比查和迪迈是一对搭档，拉图奈尔夫妇是另一对搭档。大约九点钟的时候，莫黛斯特去为她母亲就寝做准备，她走开的那一会儿，米尼翁夫人和她的朋友们可以敞开来说话了。而可怜的文书也跟其他人一样确定莫黛斯特恋爱了，他为此而感到难过不已，于是看上去就跟前一天晚上的哥本海姆一样，对这场讨论十分漠然。","Butscha, therefore, had very nearly found the key to the puzzle.With all the anxious solicitude of a hopeless lover, a vassal ever ready to die,—like the soldiers alone and abandoned in the snows of Russia, who still cried out, “Long live the Emperor,”—he meditated how to capture Modeste’s secret for his own private knowledge.So thinking, he followed his patrons to the Chalet that evening, with a cloud of care upon his brow: for he knew it was most important to hide from all these watchful eyes and ears the net, whatever it might be, in which he should entrap his lady.It would have to be, he thought, by some intercepted glance, some sudden start or quiver, as when a surgeon lays his finger on a hidden sore.That evening Gobenheim did not appear, and Butscha was Dumay’s partner against Monsieur and Madame Latournelle.During the few moment’s of Modeste’s absence, about nine o’clock, to prepare for her mother’s bedtime, Madame Mignon and her friends spoke openly to one another; but the poor clerk, depressed by the conviction of Modeste’s love, which had now seized upon him as upon the rest, seemed as remote from the discussion as Gobenheim had been the night before."
"“喂，比查，你怎么了？”拉图奈尔夫人大声说道，“人们真的会认为你在这世上没有一个朋友。”","“Well, what’s the matter with you, Butscha?” cried Madame Latournelle; “one would really think you hadn’t a friend in the world.”"
"这个可怜的孩子眼睛里闪烁着泪光，他的父亲是个瑞典水手，母亲已经过世。","Tears shone in the eyes of the poor fellow, who was the son of a Swedish sailor, and whose mother was dead."
"“在这个世界上，只有你们是我的亲人，”他哽咽着回答说，“而你们的怜悯是如此真诚，我永远都不会失去它——我永远都没有资格失去它。”","“I have no one in the world but you,” he answered with a troubled voice; “and your compassion is so much a part of your religion that I can never lose it—and I will never deserve to lose it.”"
"这一回答触动了在场所有人真正纤弱敏感的心弦。","This answer struck the sensitive chord of true delicacy in the minds of all present."
"“我们都很喜欢你，比查先生，”米尼翁夫人动情地说道。","“We love you, Monsieur Butscha,” said Madame Mignon, with much feeling in her voice."
"“我如今有了六十万法郎的私人财产，”迪迈大声说，“你以后会是个公证人，接拉图奈尔的班。”","“I’ve six hundred thousand francs of my own, this day,” cried Dumay, “and you shall be a notary and the successor of Latournelle.”"
"迪迈的美国妻子抓住这个可怜的驼子的手，紧紧地握了一下。","The American wife took the hand of the poor hunchback and pressed it."
"“什么！你有了六十万法郎！”拉图奈尔听到迪迈说出这些话，耳朵都竖起来了，惊呼道，“而你还让这些女人这样过日子！莫黛斯特应该拥有一匹好马，还有，她为什么不继续上音乐课、绘画课，还有——”","“What! you have six hundred thousand francs!” exclaimed Latournelle, pricking up his ears as Dumay let fall the words; “and you allow these ladies to live as they do!Modeste ought to have a fine horse; and why doesn’t she continue to take lessons in music, and painting, and—”"
"“哎呀，他有这些钱才几个小时呢！”小个子迪迈夫人喊道。","“Why, he has only had the money a few hours!” cried the little wife."
"“嘘！”米尼翁夫人小声说道。","“Hush!” murmured Madame Mignon."
"说这些话时，比查那庄严的女东家转向他，准备发表一番言论——","While these words were exchanged, Butscha’s august mistress turned towards him, preparing to make a speech:—"
"“孩子，”她说，“你周围的人都是真心地对你疼爱有加，以至于我从未想过该如何解释我那句轻率的话。但你应该感谢我犯的小小错误，因为它让你看到了你的高贵品质赢得了怎样的朋友。”","“My son,” she said, “you are so surrounded by true affection that I never thought how my thoughtless use of that familiar phrase might be construed; but you must thank me for my little blunder, because it has served to show you what friends your noble qualities have won.”"
"“这么说，你一定有米尼翁先生的消息了。”公证人接着说。","“Then you must have news from Monsieur Mignon,” resumed the notary."
"“他正在回来的路上，”米尼翁夫人说，“但我们还是保密吧。要是我丈夫知道了在别人都轻视我们的时候，比查对我们有多么真心，对我们表达了最热忱、最无私的友情，那我的丈夫是不会只让你一个人资助他的，迪迈。所以，我的朋友，”她将失明的脸庞转向比查，补充道，“你可以马上开始同拉图奈尔商量了。”","“He is on his way home,” said Madame Mignon; “but let us keep the secret to ourselves.When my husband learns how faithful Butscha has been to us, how he has shown us the warmest and the most disinterested friendship when others have given us the cold shoulder, he will not let you alone provide for him, Dumay.And so, my friend,” she added, turning her blind face toward Butscha; “you can begin at once to negotiate with Latournelle.”"
"“他到了法定年龄，二十五岁半了。孩子，我也会资助你买下事务所，这对我来说也算是还了一笔债。”公证人说道。","“He’s of legal age, twenty-five and a half years.As for me, it will be paying a debt, my boy, to make the purchase easy for you,” said the notary."
"就在莫黛斯特打开客厅的门时，比查正在亲吻米尼翁夫人的手，他的脸已被泪水浸湿。","Butscha was kissing Madame Mignon’s hand, and his face was wet with tears as Modeste opened the door of the salon."
"“你们对我的黑侏儒做什么了？”她问道，“谁惹他不高兴了？”","“What are you doing to my Black Dwarf?” she demanded.“Who is making him unhappy?”"
"“啊！米尼翁小姐，我们这些在不幸的摇篮中长大的不幸之人，哪里为悲伤哭过？我把他们当作真正的亲人来爱，而他们刚刚对我也表现出了同样的疼爱。我要成为一名公证人了，我会富起来。哈！哈！贫穷的比查可能变成富有的比查。您不知道我这个早产儿有多大胆。”他哭道。","“Ah! Mademoiselle Mignon, do we luckless fellows, cradled in misfortune, ever weep for grief?They have just shown me as much affection as I could feel for them if they were indeed my own relations.I’m to be a notary; I shall be rich.Ha! ha! the poor Butscha may become the rich Butscha.You don’t know what audacity there is in this abortion,” he cried."
"说着，他使劲地拍了一下胸脯，又瞄了一眼莫黛斯特，便站到了壁炉前面去。他那匆匆一瞥，就像从那半闭的厚眼皮间溜出的一道光。在这个突如其来的小插曲中，他发现了一个询问他的女王心思的机会。迪迈有一会儿以为这位文书敢追求莫黛斯特，他很快同其他人交换了眼色，大家都明白他的意思，开始以一种担心又好奇的心情看着这个小个子。","With that he gave himself a resounding blow on the cavity of his chest and took up a position before the fireplace, after casting a glance at Modeste, which slipped like a ray of light between his heavy half-closed eyelids.He perceived, in this unexpected incident, a chance of interrogating the heart of his sovereign.Dumay thought for a moment that the clerk dared to aspire to Modeste, and he exchanged a rapid glance with the others, who understood him, and began to eye the little man with a species of terror mingled with curiosity."
"“我，也有，我的梦想。”比查说，他的目光一直没离开莫黛斯特。","“I, too, have my dreams,” said Butscha, not taking his eyes from Modeste."
"这位少女眼睑低垂，这一动作对那位年轻人来说，已是某种暗示了。","The young girl lowered her eyelids with a movement that was a revelation to the young man."
"“您喜欢浪漫故事，”他对她说，“在这个快乐的时刻，请让我告诉您我的故事，然后您要告诉我，我为我的生活设想的这个故事结局是否可能。跟其他人相比，钱财将给我带来更大的幸福，因为我能想象到的最高幸福就是让我所爱的人富有。小姐，您懂得那么多事情，请告诉我，一个男人，不管他的外表是帅气还是丑陋，仅凭他的心灵就能叫别人爱上他，这有可能吗？”","“You love romance,” he said, addressing her.“Let me, in this moment of happiness, tell you mine; and you shall tell me in return whether the conclusion of the tale I have invented for my life is possible.To me wealth would bring greater happiness than to other men; for the highest happiness I can imagine would be to enrich the one I loved.You, mademoiselle, who know so many things, tell me if it is possible for a man to make himself beloved independently of his person, be it handsome or ugly, and for his spirit only?”"
"莫黛斯特抬起眼睛看着比查。她尖锐的目光里充满质问，因为她跟迪迈一样，怀疑比查的动机。","Modeste raised her eyes and looked at Butscha.It was a piercing and questioning glance; for she shared Dumay’s suspicion of Butscha’s motive."
"“如果我富有了，我会找一个漂亮而贫穷的女孩，一个像我一样被抛弃过、受过苦、了解什么是痛苦的女孩。我会给她写信，安慰她，还要做她的守护神。她会读懂我的心，我的灵魂，她会拥有双份财富，我的两份财富——我温柔地奉献出的金钱，还有我光彩照人的思想，因为出生时，命运给了我丑陋的身体，没有给我外在的光彩。但我会继续隐藏自己，就像被科学家苦苦探寻的一个原因那样。上帝自己说不定也不起眼。那么，这位少女自然会十分好奇，她将希望见到我，但我会告诉她我是一个丑陋的魔鬼，我会把自己形容得极其可怕。”","“Let me be rich, and I will seek some beautiful poor girl, abandoned like myself, who has suffered, who knows what misery is.I will write to her and console her, and be her guardian spirit; she shall read my heart, my soul; she shall possess by double wealth, my two wealths,—my gold, delicately offered, and my thought robed in all the splendor which the accident of birth has denied to my grotesque body.But I myself shall remain hidden like the cause that science seeks.God himself may not be glorious to the eye.Well, naturally, the maiden will be curious; she will wish to see me; but I shall tell her that I am a monster of ugliness; I shall picture myself hideous.”"
"听了这些话，莫黛斯特把目光瞥向比查，专注地打量他。如果她大声问：“你知道我恋情的哪些事？”那她的事就再清楚不过了。","At these words Modeste gave Butscha a glance that looked him through and through.If she had said aloud, “What do you know of my love?” she could not have been more explicit."
"“如果我有幸因内心的诗情得到爱慕，如果有一天，这样的爱情能让一个女子认为我只是有一点儿畸形而已，我问您，小姐，难道我不会比最英俊的男人还要幸福吗？——就像一个天才的男人被某个您这样的天使爱着那样幸福。”","“If I have the honor of being loved for the poem of my heart, if some day such love may make a woman think me only slightly deformed, I ask you, mademoiselle, shall I not be happier than the handsomest of men,—as happy as a man of genius beloved by some celestial being like yourself.”"
"少女羞红的脸颊几乎告诉了驼子所有他想知道的事情。","The color which suffused the young girl’s face told the cripple nearly all he sought to know."
"“那么，如果那样，”他接着说，“如果我们让所爱的人变得富有，如果我们让他们从精神上感到快乐，而不考虑长相，难道这不是争取爱慕的方式吗？不管怎样，这是您可怜的侏儒的梦想——昨天的梦想，因为今天，您的母亲答应资助我盘下一家事务所，这给了我通向未来财富的钥匙。但在我成为另一个哥本海姆之前，我很想知道这一梦想能否真正实现。小姐，您，怎么说呢？”","“Well, if that be so,” he went on, “if we enrich the one we love, if we please the spirit and withdraw the body, is not that the way to make one’s self beloved?At any rate it is the dream of your poor dwarf,—a dream of yesterday; for today your mother gives me the key to future wealth by promising me the means of buying a practice.But before I become another Gobenheim, I seek to know whether this dream could be really carried out.What do you say, mademoiselle, you?”"
"莫黛斯特太震惊了，以至于她都没有注意到这个问题。这位爱慕者的圈套设计得要比老兵迪迈那个好得多，因为这位可怜的姑娘已经无言以对了。","Modeste was so astonished that she did not notice the question.The trap of the lover was much better baited than that of the soldier, for the poor girl was rendered speechless."
"“可怜的比查！”拉图奈尔夫人对她的丈夫耳语道，“你觉得他是不是要疯了？”","“Poor Butscha!” whispered Madame Latournelle to her husband.“Do you think he is going mad?”"
"“你是想把美女与野兽的故事变成现实，”莫黛斯特终于说话了，“但你忘了野兽最后变成了白马王子。”","“You want to realize the story of Beauty and the Beast,” said Modeste at length; “but you forget that the Beast turned into Prince Charming.”"
"“您是这样认为的？”矮个子说道，“可我一直认为，那种变化说明了一种现象，就是心灵变得可见了，精神的光辉彻底遮盖了外表。如果我没被爱上，那我就继续隐姓埋名，就那样。您和您的全家，夫人，”他接着对他的女东家说道，“到那时，有的不再是一个为你们服务的矮个子，而是一个活人、一笔财富。”","“Do you think so?” said the dwarf.“Now I have always thought that that transformation meant the phenomenon of the soul made visible, obliterating the form under the light of the spirit.If I were not loved I should stay hidden, that is all.You and yours, madame,” he continued, addressing his mistress, “instead of having a dwarf at your service, will now have a life and a fortune.”"
"说完这些，比查又坐回到他的位子上，假装镇定地跟另外三个玩惠斯特牌的人说：“该谁出牌了？”但是，他在心里忧愁地对自己嘀咕道：“她想凭自己的人格赢得爱慕，她在跟某个冒充大人物的人通信，这一切进展到什么程度了呢？”","So saying, Butscha resumed his seat, remarking to the three whist-players with an assumption of calmness, “Whose deal is it?” but within his soul he whispered sadly to himself: “She wants to be loved for herself; she corresponds with some pretended great man; how far has it gone?”"
"“亲爱的妈妈，差不多十点钟了。”莫黛斯特说。","“Dear mamma, it is nearly ten o’clock,” said Modeste."
"米尼翁夫人跟她的朋友们说了晚安，便去睡了。","Madame Mignon said good-night to her friends, and went to bed."
"想偷偷恋爱的人，他们可以在比利牛斯犬、母亲、迪迈一家以及拉图奈尔一家的侦察之下平安无事，但是，当一个爱慕者来侦察时！——啊！那就是宝石切宝石，火对火，智斗智，是一个两边对等的方程式了。","They who wish to love in secret may have Pyrenean hounds, mothers, Dumays, and Latournelles to spy upon them, and yet not be in any danger; but when it comes to a lover!—ah! that is diamond cut diamond, flame against flame, mind to mind, an equation whose terms are mutual."
"星期天早晨，比查先于总是来带莫黛斯特去教堂的拉图奈尔夫人到达木屋，并开始封锁房子，等着邮差到来。","On Sunday morning Butscha arrived at the Chalet before Madame Latournelle, who always came to take Modeste to church, and he proceeded to blockade the house in expectation of the postman."
"“您有米尼翁小姐的信吗？”那个身份卑微的公职人员到达时，比查这样问他。","“Have you a letter for Mademoiselle Mignon?” he said to that humble functionary when he appeared."
"“没有，先生，一封都没有。”","“No, monsieur, none.”"
"“这个家最近是邮局的常客啊。”文书说道。","“This house has been a good customer to the post of late,” remarked the clerk."
"“那倒是。”邮差回答道。","“You may well say that,” replied the man."
"莫黛斯特每天这个时候都在百叶窗后面守着邮差，于是她看到了比查和邮差说话，还听到了这次小小谈话的内容。她跑下楼，走进小花园里，用命令的口吻喊道——","Modeste both heard and saw the little colloquy from her chamber window, where she always posted herself behind the blinds at this particular hour to watch for the postman.She ran downstairs, went into the little garden, and called in an imperative voice:—"
"“比查先生！”","“Monsieur Butscha!”"
"“我在这儿，小姐。”小瘸子说道。他走到花园门口时，莫黛斯特正好打开门。","“Here am I, mademoiselle,” said the cripple, reaching the gate as Modeste herself opened it."
"“您能不能告诉我，在您博得女人青睐的种种方式中，您现在所做的这无耻的暗中监视是不是也算在其中呢？”这位姑娘问道，试图以她王后般的目光和姿态来镇压她的奴隶。","“Will you be good enough to tell me whether among your various titles to a woman’s affection you count that of the shameless spying in which you are now engaged?” demanded the girl, endeavoring to crush her slave with the glance and gesture of a queen."
"“是的，小姐，”他自豪地回答道，“啊！我从来都没期望过，”他接着低声说道，“小小的蛴螬还能为一个明星服务——但事实就是这样。您宁可让您的母亲、迪迈先生还有拉图奈尔夫人猜到您的秘密，也不愿我这样一个人，一个被生活遗弃的人知道？可我却想成为您身上的一朵鲜花，虽然您摘下我之后只戴一会儿。他们都知道您恋爱了，但是我，只有我，知道您是怎样恋爱的。像使唤一只警觉的看门狗那样使唤我吧，我会服从您、保护您，而且永远都不会吠叫，也不会责备您。我只要求为您效劳。您的父亲已经让迪迈做了鸡窝的看管人，您就让比查看管外面吧——可怜的比查，他不要求任何东西，连一根骨头都不要。”","“Yes, mademoiselle,” he answered proudly.“Ah! I never expected,” he continued in a low tone, “that the grub could be of service to a star,—but so it is.Would you rather that your mother and Monsieur Dumay and Madame Latournelle had guessed your secret than one, excluded as it were from life, who seeks to be to you one of those flowers that you cut and wear for a moment?They all know you love; but I, I alone, know how.Use me as you would a vigilant watch-dog; I will obey you, protect you, and never bark; neither will I condemn you.I ask only to be of service to you.Your father has made Dumay keeper of the hen-roost, take Butscha to watch outside,—poor Butscha, who doesn’t ask for anything, not so much as a bone.”"
"“好吧，我马上就试用你，”莫黛斯特说，她最强烈的愿望就是摆脱掉这个如此精明的看守，“请马上到格拉维尔和勒阿弗尔的所有旅馆去，看看是否有一个叫亚瑟先生的男子从英国来了——”","“Well, I’ve give you a trial,” said Modeste, whose strongest desire was to get rid of so clever a watcher.“Please go at once to all the hotels in Graville and in Havre, and ask if a gentleman has arrived from England named Monsieur Arthur—”"
"“请听我说，小姐，”比查恭敬地打断了莫黛斯特，说道，“我会到海边去散步，因为您今天不想让我到教堂去，仅此而已。”","“Listen to me, mademoiselle,” said Butscha, interrupting Modeste respectfully.“I will go and take a walk on the seashore, for you don’t want me to go to church today; that’s what it is.”"
"莫黛斯特看着她的小矮人，完全愣住了。","Modeste looked at her dwarf with a perfectly stupid astonishment."
"“小姐，您已经用药棉和丝巾裹住了脸，但您没什么毛病，您还在帽子上盖上厚厚的面纱，那样别人就看不到您的脸，您却可以看到别人。”","“Mademoiselle, you have wrapped your face in cotton-wool and a silk handkerchief, but there’s nothing the matter with you; and you have put that thick veil on your bonnet to see some one yourself without being seen.”"
"“你是从哪儿得到这些洞察力的呢？”莫黛斯特满脸通红地喊道。","“Where did you acquire all that perspicacity?” cried Modeste, blushing."
"“还有，小姐，您没穿胸衣，而且，就是着凉了您也没必要穿好几件衬裙来丑化您的身材啊，没必要戴着旧手套来掩藏您的手啊，没必要穿丑靴子来掩盖您漂亮的双脚啊，没必要把您自己打扮得像个女乞丐一样啊，也没必要——”","“Moreover, mademoiselle, you have not put on your corset; a cold in the head wouldn’t oblige you to disfigure your waist and wear half a dozen petticoats, nor hide your hands in these old gloves, and your pretty feet in those hideous shoes, nor dress yourself like a beggar-woman, nor—”"
"“够了，”她说，“我怎样才能确定你会服从我呢？”","“That’s enough,” she said.“How am I to be certain that you will obey me?”"
"“我的东家要去圣阿德雷斯。他不想去，但他真的很善良，不愿剥夺我的星期天。我会主动替他去。”","“My master is obliged to go to Sainte-Adresse.He does not like it, but he is so truly good he won’t deprive me of my Sunday; I will offer to go for him.”"
"“去吧，那样我就会信任你。”","“Go, and I will trust you.”"
"“您确定我在勒阿弗尔不能为您做任何事吗？”","“You are sure I can do nothing for you in Havre?”"
"“是的。听我说，神秘的小矮人——你看，”她指着万里无云的天空继续说道，“你能看到刚刚飞过的那只鸟儿留下的一丝轨迹么？不能。那好，我的行动像天空一样纯净，而且不会留下任何痕迹。你可以消除迪迈、拉图奈尔一家以及我母亲的疑虑。这只手，”说着，她举起一只漂亮纤细的手，阳光透过那玫瑰色手指的指尖照射下来，她稍稍转过身说，“在我父亲回来之前，它永远都不会被交给别人，甚至永远都不会被人们所谓的情人亲吻。”","“Nothing.Hear me, mysterious dwarf,—look,” she continued, pointing to the cloudless sky; “can you see a single trace of that bird that flew by just now?No; well then, my actions are pure as the air is pure, and leave no stain behind them.You may reassure Dumay and the Latournelles, and my mother.That hand,” she said, holding up a pretty delicate hand, with the points of the rosy fingers, through which the light shone, slightly turning back, “will never be given, it will never even be kissed by what people call a lover until my father has returned.”"
"“您今天为什么不让我去教堂？”","“Why don’t you want me in the church today?”"
"“我跟你说了那些话，又让你为我做事，已经是给足了你面子，你还敢来盘问我？”","“Do you venture to question me after all I have done you the honor to say, and to ask of you?”"
"比查没有再说话，鞠了一躬便起身去找他的东家了。他沉浸在能为他的天使效劳的极度欢喜之中。","Butscha bowed without another word, and departed to find his master, in all the rapture of being taken into the service of his goddess."
"半个小时后，拉图奈尔先生和夫人来接莫黛斯特了，莫黛斯特说牙疼得厉害。","Half an hour later, Monsieur and Madame Latournelle came to fetch Modeste, who complained of a horrible toothache."
"“我真的连给自己穿衣服的力气都没了。”她说。","“I really have not had the courage to dress myself,” she said."
"“那好吧，”这位可敬的女伴回答说，“那就呆在家里吧。”","“Well then,” replied the worthy chaperone, “stay at home.”"
"“哎呀，不！”莫黛斯特说，“我不想呆在家里。我已经把自己裹得严严实实的了，我想出门对我不会有什么坏处。”","“Oh, no!” said Modeste.“I would rather not.I have bundled myself up, and I don’t think it will do me any harm to go out.”"
"一想到终于要见到她伟大的诗人了，莫黛斯特就激动不已，浑身发抖。米尼翁小姐走在拉图奈尔身边，却不肯挽着他的手臂，免得被问到为什么发抖。一瞥，第一瞥——不就即将决定她的命运吗？","And Mademoiselle Mignon marched off beside Latournelle, refusing to take his arm lest she should be questioned about the outward trembling which betrayed her inward agitation at the thought of at last seeing her great poet.One look, the first,—was it not about to decide her fate?"
"第十三章 一幅德拉布里埃先生的全身像","Chapter XIII A Full-Length Portrait of Monsieur De La Briere"
"在男人的一生中，还有比第一次约会更令人高兴的时刻吗？隐藏在心底的情感第一次迸发出来，这种情感还能重新来过吗？像埃内斯特·德拉布里埃一样，当我们寻找最锋利的剃须刀、最漂亮的衬衫、洁白无暇的领结以及最好的衣服时，所感受到的那种无名的快乐，能够重温吗？由于这些衣着与那一至高无上的时刻息息相关，我们便将它们奉若神明。与女人一样，我们内心也摇曳着诗意的幻想。等到男女双方都猜透这一切的那一天，这些幻想就自己张开翅膀飞走了。这些事情，不正如生长在森林腹地的野果之花，苦涩而甜美吗？不正如沐浴在宝贵阳光中的快乐吗？不正如卡那利在《少女之歌》中说到的，那株紫罗兰睁开眼睛看到内心的自我时的快乐吗？","Is there in the life of man a more delightful moment than that of a first rendezvous?Are the sensations then hidden at the bottom of our hearts and finding their first expression ever renewed?Can we feel again the nameless pleasures that we felt when, like Ernest de La Briere, we looked up our sharpest razors, our finest shirt, an irreproachable collar, and our best clothes?We deify the garments associated with that all-supreme moment.We weave within us poetic fancies quite equal to those of the woman; and the day when either party guesses them they take wings to themselves and fly away.Are not such things like the flower of wild fruits, bitter-sweet, grown in the heart of a forest, the joy of the scant sun-rays, the joy, as Canalis says in the “Maiden’s Song,” of the plant itself whose eyes unclosing see its own image within its breast?"
"这样的情感正发生在拉布里埃身上。从中我们大概能看出，跟其他生来艰辛操劳的人一样，他还从来没被爱过。他前一天晚上到达勒阿弗尔之后，就真像个风情万种的女子一样，马上上床睡觉，以便消除所有疲劳的痕迹。而现在，洗过澡之后，他穿上了精心设计的服饰，从而展现他最突出的一面。也许，这正是展示一幅他的全身像的最佳时刻，即使只是为了证明莫黛斯特将要给他写的最后一封信言之有理。","Such emotions, now taking place in La Briere, tend to show that, like other poor fellows for whom life begins in toil and care, he had never yet been loved.Arriving at Havre overnight, he had gone to bed at once, like a true coquette, to obliterate all traces of fatigue; and now, after taking his bath, he had put himself into a costume carefully adapted to show him off to the best advantage.This is, perhaps, the right moment to exhibit a full-length portrait of him, if only to justify the last letter that Modeste was still to write to him."
"埃内斯特出生于图卢兹一个良好的家庭，跟先前保护过他的那位大臣沾点亲。他举止颇有教养，这来自于婴儿时期便开始的良好教育。处理公务养成的习惯让他显得沉稳镇静，却并非书生气——尽管过早沉稳的人自然会带些书生气。他中等个头，细腻甜美的脸庞征服了所有见过他的人，肤色尽管不够红润，但至少是暖色调的。他还留着小胡子和马萨林式的帝髯。若不是有这一男性的证据，他简直就像个男扮女装的年轻姑娘了。他的脸部轮廓和嘴唇线条是那么精致，两排牙齿整齐得像是假的，透明的象牙白色是那么女性化。除这些类似女性的特征之外，他的说话方式也跟面部表情一样柔和，跟土耳其式眼睑下的蓝色双眸一样温柔。这样你就很容易明白为什么那位大臣有时候称这位年轻秘书为“德拉布里埃小姐”了。他饱满干净的额头，恰到好处地镶嵌在浓密的黑发之中，如梦幻一般，与那张整体充满忧郁的脸庞浑然一体。他的上眼皮有着突起的棱角，虽然轮廓十分漂亮，但还是遮住了目光，并在眼皮下垂的时候，平添了几分忧伤的表现——如果我们可以这样说的话。他全身上下都散发着这种内在的疑虑或黯然——用一个词表达就是谦虚。按照绘画的逻辑，他那鹅蛋型的脸还应该更长些，在他收得太快的下巴和因头发太长而显得不够高的额头之间，应该有更大的空间，这样一说，也许大家就能对他的相貌有更直观的了解。简言之，他的脸长得太紧凑了。辛劳的工作已经在他的眉宇间刻上了皱纹，他的眉毛有点太粗了，而且像那些生性好嫉妒的人似的，眉毛离得过近。虽然拉布里埃当时比较瘦，但他还是属于三十岁后会突然长一身肉的那种人。","Born of a good family in Toulouse, and allied by marriage to the minister who first took him under his protection, Ernest had that air of good-breeding which comes of an education begun in the cradle; and the habit of managing business affairs gave him a certain sedateness which was not pedantic,—though pedantry is the natural outgrowth of premature gravity.He was of ordinary height; his face, which won upon all who saw him by its delicacy and sweetness, was warm in the flesh-tints, though without color, and relieved by a small moustache and imperial a la Mazarin.Without this evidence of virility he might have resembled a young woman in disguise, so refined was the shape of his face and the cut of his lips, so feminine the transparent ivory of a set of teeth, regular enough to have seemed artificial.Add to these womanly points a habit of speech as gentle as the expression of the face; as gentle, too, as the blue eyes with their Turkish eyelids, and you will readily understand how it was that the minister occasionally called his young secretary Mademoiselle de La Briere.The full, clear forehead, well framed by abundant black hair, was dreamy, and did not contradict the character of the face, which was altogether melancholy.The prominent arch of the upper eyelid, though very beautifully cut, overshadowed the glance of the eye, and added a physical sadness,—if we may so call it,—produced by the droop of the lid over the eyeball.This inward doubt or eclipse—which is put into language by the word modesty—was expressed in his whole person.Perhaps we shall be able to make his appearance better understood if we say that the logic of design required greater length in the oval of his head, more space between the chin, which ended abruptly, and the forehead, which was reduced in height by the way in which the hair grew.The face had, in short, a rather compressed appearance.Hard work had already drawn furrows between the eyebrows, which were somewhat too thick and too near together, like those of a jealous nature.Though La Briere was then slight, he belonged to the class of temperaments which begin, after they are thirty, to take on an unexpected amount of flesh."
"在学习法国历史的学生看来，这位年轻人颇有点像气度高贵、深不可测的路易十三——那位历史人物有着莫名的忧郁与谦逊，皇冠下的脸苍白无血色；爱好战争的风险和狩猎的劳累，但讨厌工作；害怕他的夫人，到了对她敬而远之的程度；对什么都漠不关心，以至于任由他的朋友被砍头——他的脸就像一个难解之谜，唯一的解释就是他因替父亲报复母亲而感到懊悔。他是一个信天主教的哈姆雷特呢，还是仅仅只是一个患了不治之症的病人呢？不过，啃食着国王生命要害的不死之虫在埃内斯特身上，只是表现为缺乏自信心——一个没听女人说过“啊，我多么爱你啊！”的男人的胆怯，还有最重要的一点，就是毫无目的的自我奉献精神。随着他主人所在的内阁的倒台，这个可怜的小伙子听到了王朝的丧钟。此后，他便倒在了一块被美丽的青苔所覆盖的顽石上，那顽石的名字就叫卡那利。因此，他仍在寻找爱的能力，这种宠臣寻找主人的精神，却赋予了他国王发现宠臣时的那种外在表现。这种感情的游戏，再加上这个年轻人脸上一种总体的忧伤气质，使他的脸庞漂亮得超出了自己的想象，因为他总是不高兴女人们把他归类为“抑郁的美男子”——一个已过时的类型，因为在当今这个时代，每个男人都努力自吹自擂，让自己高人一等。","The young man would have seemed to a student of French history a very fair representative of the royal and almost inconceivable figure of Louis XIII.,—that historical figure of melancholy modesty without known cause; pallid beneath the crown; loving the dangers of war and the fatigues of hunting, but hating work; timid with his mistress to the extent of keeping away from her; so indifferent as to allow the head of his friend to be cut off,—a figure that nothing can explain but his remorse for having avenged his father on his mother.Was he a Catholic Hamlet, or merely the victim of incurable disease?But the undying worm which gnawed at the king’s vitals was in Ernest’s case simply distrust of himself,—the timidity of a man to whom no woman had ever said, “Ah, how I love thee!” and, above all, the spirit of self-devotion without an object.After hearing the knell of the monarchy in the fall of his patron’s ministry, the poor fellow had next fallen upon a rock covered with exquisite mosses, named Canalis; he was, therefore, still seeking a power to love, and this spaniel-like search for a master gave him outwardly the air of a king who has met with his.This play of feeling, and a general tone of suffering in the young man’s face made it more really beautiful than he was himself aware of; for he had always been annoyed to find himself classed by women among the “handsome disconsolate,”—a class which has passed out of fashion in these days, when every man seeks to blow his own trumpet and put himself in the advance."
"缺乏自信的埃内斯特，把他目前的希望寄托在他穿的时髦衣服上了。为了这次一切都取决于第一印象的神圣会面，他穿了一条黑裤子，一双擦得锃亮的靴子，一件黄绿色的背心，露出做工精细、钉有乳白色纽扣的衬衣，打着一条黑色领带，身穿一件蓝色小礼服，背部和肩膀处十分贴身，像是用某种新式方法粘到身上去的。他的扣眼里系着荣誉军团的饰带。他戴着一双佛罗伦萨青铜色的小山羊皮手套，大小非常合适，左手拿着手杖和帽子，摆出一副“伟大的君主”（指路易十四）般的姿态和风度。按照这一神圣地点的要求，他露出了光亮的额头，让阳光照在他精心梳理过的头发上。弥撒开始前，他站在教堂门廊上，从那里可以端详整个教堂和所有基督徒——特别是女基督徒——看着她们把手指浸在圣水里。","The self-distrustful Ernest now rested his immediate hopes on the fashionable clothes he intended to wear.He put on, for this sacred interview, where everything depended on a first impression, a pair of black trousers and carefully polished boots, a sulphur-colored waistcoat, which left to sight an exquisitely fine shirt with opal buttons, a black cravat, and a small blue surtout coat which seemed glued to his back and shoulders by some newly-invented process.The ribbon of the Legion of honor was in his buttonhole.He wore a well-fitting pair of kid gloves of the Florentine bronze color, and carried his cane and hat in the left hand with a gesture and air that was worthy of the Grand Monarch, and enabled him to show, as the sacred precincts required, his bare head with the light falling on his carefully arranged hair.He stationed himself before the service began in the church porch, from whence he could examine the church, and the Christians—more particularly the female Christians—who dipped their fingers in the holy water."
"莫黛斯特走进教堂时，内心的一个声音冲她喊道：“就是他！”那礼服，以及这位年轻人的整个气质，的确体现出巴黎人的本质，那饰带、那手套、那手杖，还有他发间的香气，都不是勒阿弗尔的。于是，当拉布里埃转过身来审视高大威严的拉图奈尔夫人、公证人以及裹得严严实实的（这个表达是专用于女人的）莫黛斯特时，这个可怜的孩子虽然已有充分的思想准备，但当她看到敞开的门里透进来的大片日光照亮这个富有诗意的人儿时，心头还是感到猛的一击。她肯定没搞错。一朵白玫瑰几乎遮住了他的荣誉军团饰带。他还能认出他那戴了一顶旧帽子、蒙着双重面纱的匿名女王吗？莫黛斯特很害怕爱情异常敏锐的洞察力，于是她开始像个老妇人一样弯着腰走路。","An inward voice cried to Modeste as she entered, “It is he!”That surtout, and indeed the whole bearing of the young man were essentially Parisian; the ribbon, the gloves, the cane, the very perfume of his hair were not of Havre.So when La Briere turned about to examine the tall and imposing Madame Latournelle, the notary, and the bundled-up (expression sacred to women) figure of Modeste, the poor child, though she had carefully tutored herself for the event, received a violent blow on her heart when her eyes rested on this poetic figure, illuminated by the full light of day as it streamed through the open door.She could not be mistaken; a small white rose nearly hid the ribbon of the Legion.Would he recognize his unknown mistress muffled in an old bonnet with a double veil?Modeste was so in fear of love’s clairvoyance that she began to stoop in her walk like an old woman."
"“老伴，”小个子拉图奈尔一边坐下来一边说，“那位绅士不是勒阿弗尔人。”","“Wife,” said little Latournelle as they took their seats, “that gentleman does not belong to Havre.”"
"“好多陌生人来这儿的。”他的妻子回答道。","“So many strangers come here,” answered his wife."
"“但是，”公证人说，“陌生人从来都不会来参观我们这样的教堂啊，它的历史还不到两百年。”","“But,” said the notary, “strangers never come to look at a church like ours, which is less than two centuries old.”"
"整个弥撒过程中，埃内斯特一直都站在门廊里，却没看到一个能实现他梦想的女子。而莫黛斯特则不能自已地浑身发抖，一直到弥撒差不多结束。她领略到的快乐，除了她自己没有人能够描述。终于，她听到了走廊地面上一个男子的脚步声。此时弥撒已经结束了，拉布里埃正在教堂里绕着圈子。教堂里只剩下那些一丝不苟的虔诚教徒，他开始对他们进行细致透彻的分析。埃内斯特从一个女人身边走过时，注意到这个戴着面纱的女人手里的祈祷书在剧烈地颤抖。由于只有她一个人是蒙着脸的，埃内斯特便起了疑心。接着，这位情人的眼睛又扫到了莫黛斯特的衣服，这衣着引起了他的注意，证实了他的怀疑。他跟着拉图奈尔夫妇离开了教堂，并远远地跟着他们到了王政街，看到莫黛斯特陪着他们一起进了一所房子。按照惯例，莫黛斯特要跟她的朋友一直呆到做晚祷的时候。埃内斯特打量了一下这座门口饰有盾形标志的小房子，接着又打听了房主的名字。别人告诉他，房子的主人是拉图奈尔先生，勒阿弗尔的首席公证人。埃内斯特沿着王政街溜达着，想往房子里瞅上一眼。这时，莫黛斯特看到了他，于是她说自己病得厉害，不能去做晚祷了。这样，可怜的埃内斯特的辛苦就白费了。他不敢到安古维尔去转悠，而且，他也把服从命令当作维护自己颜面所必须做的事，于是便回到了巴黎。在回巴黎之前，他还写了一封信。弗朗索瓦丝·科歇第二天准时把这封信交给了莫黛斯特，信封上盖的是勒阿弗尔的邮戳。","Ernest remained in the porch throughout the service without seeing any woman who realized his hopes.Modeste, on her part, could not control the trembling of her limbs until Mass was nearly over.She was in the grasp of a joy that none but she herself could depict.At last she heard the foot-fall of a gentleman on the pavement of the aisle.The service over, La Briere was making a circuit of the church, where no one now remained but the punctiliously pious, whom he proceeded to subject to a shrewd and keen analysis.Ernest noticed that a prayer-book shook violently in the hands of a veiled woman as he passed her; as she alone kept her face hidden his suspicions were aroused, and then confirmed by Modeste’s dress, which the lover’s eye now scanned and noted.He left the church with the Latournelles and followed them at a distance to the rue Royale, where he saw them enter a house accompanied by Modeste, whose custom it was to stay with her friends till the hour of vespers.After examining the little house, which was ornamented with scutcheons, he asked the name of the owner, and was told that he was Monsieur Latournelle, the chief notary in Havre.As Ernest lounged along the rue Royale hoping for a glimpse into the house, Modeste caught sight of him, and thereupon declared herself too ill to go to vespers.Poor Ernest thus had his trouble for his pains.He dared not wander about Ingouville; moreover, he made it a point of honor to obey orders, and he therefore went back to Paris, previously writing a letter which Francoise Cochet duly delivered on the morrow with the Havre postmark."
"按照惯例，每个星期天，拉图奈尔先生和夫人在晚祷结束后都会把莫黛斯特带回来，然后在木屋用餐。所以，一等这位病人感觉好些了，他们便在比查的陪同下动身回安古维尔。一到家，兴高采烈的莫黛斯特便忘记了她装病和乔装打扮的事，把自己打扮得漂漂亮亮的，下楼吃饭时嘴里还哼着歌——","It was the custom of Monsieur and Madame Latournelle to dine at the Chalet every Sunday when they brought back Modeste after vespers.So, as soon as the invalid felt a little better, they started for Ingouville, accompanied by Butscha.Once at home, the happy Modeste forgot her pretended illness and her disguise, and dressed herself charmingly, humming as she came down to dinner,—"
"“不再沉睡了——我的心！醒来吧，把你的芬芳抛向天堂吧。”","“Nought is sleeping—Heart! awaking,Lift thine incense to the skies.”"
"比查看到她的时候，稍稍哆嗦了一下，对他来讲，莫黛斯特变化太大了。她的肩头插上了爱情的翅膀，她散发着仙女的气息，普赛克的气息，脸颊泛着幸福的红光。","Butscha shuddered slightly when he caught sight of her, so changed did she seem to him.The wings of love were fastened to her shoulders; she had the air of a nymph, a Psyche; her cheeks glowed with the divine color of happiness."
"“你唱的那首美妙的曲子，是谁写的歌词啊？”她的母亲问道。","“Who wrote the words to which you have put that pretty music?” asked her mother."
"“是卡那利，妈妈。”她回答道，从脖子到额头顿时羞成了玫瑰红。","“Canalis, mamma,” she answered, flushing rosy red from her throat to her forehead."
"“卡那利！”小矮人叫道。莫黛斯特嗓音的变化以及羞红的脸颊告诉了比查他唯一不知道的事情。“他，那个伟大的诗人，他也写歌词吗？”","“Canalis!” cried the dwarf, to whom the inflections of the girl’s voice and her blush told the only thing of which he was still ignorant.“He, that great poet, does he write songs?”"
"“本来只是几句诗，”她说，“我大着胆子配上了德国的小调。”","“They are only simple verses,” she said, “which I have ventured to set to German airs.”"
"“不，不，”米尼翁夫人打断她，“这曲子是你自己创作的，我的女儿。”","“No, no,” interrupted Madame Mignon, “the music is your own, my daughter.”"
"莫黛斯特感觉她的脸越来越红了，就叫比查跟着她去花园里。","Modeste, feeling that she grew more and more crimson, went off into the garden, calling Butscha after her."
"“你可以帮我一个大忙。”她说，“对于我父亲带回来的财产，迪迈对我母亲和我保了密，而我想知道那个秘密。爸爸刚出门的时候，迪迈不是给他寄了五十多万法郎吗？没错。那么，我爸爸可不是那种离家四年却只将本钱翻了一番的人。好像他正乘自己的船回来，而光迪迈的那一份财产就有差不多六十万法郎。”","“You can do me a great service,” she said.“Dumay is keeping a secret from my mother and me as to the fortune which my father is bringing back with him; and I want to know what it is.Did not Dumay send papa when he first went away over five hundred thousand francs?Yes.Well, papa is not the kind of man to stay away four years and only double his capital.It seems he is coming back on a ship of his own, and Dumay’s share amounts to almost six hundred thousand francs.”"
"“没必要问迪迈，”比查说，“你知道的，你父亲走的时候亏损四百万，毫无疑问，他已经赚回这个数目了。他自然会把赚来的十分之一给迪迈，这位可敬的人前几天承认他拿到了多少，这样算来，我和我东家觉得上校的财产肯定有六七百万——”","“There is no need to question Dumay,” said Butscha.“Your father lost, as you know, about four millions when he went away, and he has doubtless recovered them.He would of course give Dumay ten per cent of his profits; the worthy man admitted the other day how much it was, and my master and I think that in that case the colonel’s fortune must amount to six or seven millions—”"
"“啊，爸爸！”莫黛斯特双手交叉在胸前，仰望天空，大声喊道，“你这是给了我两次生命啊！”","“Oh, papa!” cried Modeste, crossing her hands on her breast and looking up to heaven, “twice you have given me life!”"
"“啊，小姐！”比查说，“您爱上了一位诗人。那种人可跟那喀索斯似的，多多少少都有点自恋啊。他知道该怎么爱您吗？一个擅长吟诗颂词、总是忙于遣词造句的人，一定是个乏味的人。小姐，一位诗人并不等于一首诗篇，就像一粒种子并不等于一朵花。”","“Ah, mademoiselle!” said Butscha, “you love a poet.That kind of man is more or less of a Narcissus.Will he know how to love you?A phrase-maker, always busy in fitting words together, must be a bore.Mademoiselle, a poet is no more poetry than a seed is a flower.”"
"“比查，我从来都没见过那么英俊的男子。”","“Butscha, I never saw so handsome a man.”"
"“美貌是一种面纱，通常是用来掩藏瑕疵的。”","“Beauty is a veil which often serves to hide imperfections.”"
"“他的心灵最像天堂里的天使了——”","“He has the most angelic heart of heaven—”"
"“我向上帝祈祷，但愿您是对的，”小矮人双掌合十说，“——还有，但愿您会幸福！那个人会跟您一样，拥有一个叫让·比查的仆人。我不会当公证人了，我放弃，我要研究科学。”","“I pray God you may be right,” said the dwarf, clasping his hands, “—and happy!That man shall have, as you have, a servant in Jean Butscha.I will not be notary; I shall give that up; I shall study the sciences.”"
"“为什么？”","“Why?”"
"“啊，小姐，为了培养您的孩子呀，如果您肯屈尊让我做他们的家庭教师。但是，唉！但愿您肯听我几句建议。让我接手这件事吧，让我深入调查这个人的生活和习惯——弄清他是否善良，是否脾气好，是否温柔，是否拥有好丈夫的品格、值得尊重，是否能真心实意地爱您，把您置于一切之上，甚至是他自己的才华之上——”","“Ah, mademoiselle, to train up your children, if you will deign to make me their tutor.But, oh! if you would only listen to some advice.Let me take up this matter; let me look into the life and habits of this man,—find out if he is kind, or bad-tempered, or gentle, if he commands the respect which you merit in a husband, if he is able to love utterly, preferring you to everything, even his own talent—”"
"“如果我已经爱上他了，这样做还有什么意义呢？”","“What does that signify if I love him?”"
"“啊，也对！”小矮人喊道。","“Ah, true!” cried the dwarf."
"此刻，米尼翁夫人正对她的朋友们说道——","At that instant Madame Mignon was saying to her friends,—"
"“我女儿今天早晨看到了她爱的人。”","“My daughter saw the man she loves this morning.”"
"“那么，肯定就是那个穿着黄绿色背心、让你好生疑惑的人了，拉图奈尔，”他的妻子说。“那个年轻人在他的扣眼里插了一支漂亮的白玫瑰。”","“Then it must have been that sulphur waistcoat which puzzled you so, Latournelle,” said his wife.“The young man had a pretty white rose in his buttonhole.”"
"“啊！”这位母亲叹息道，“那是他们相认的标志。”","“Ah!” sighed the mother, “the sign of recognition.”"
"“而且他还戴着荣誉军团军官的徽章。是个有魅力的年轻人。但我们都在自欺欺人啊，莫黛斯特从没掀起过她的面纱，而且她的衣服臃肿得像个乞丐女——”","“And he also wore the ribbon of an officer of the Legion of honor.He is a charming young man.But we are all deceiving ourselves; Modeste never raised her veil, and her clothes were huddled on like a beggar-woman’s—”"
"“还有，她说她生病了，”公证人大声说，“但现在她把那些包头的东西都摘掉了，看上去跟往常一样健康啊。”","“And she said she was ill,” cried the notary; “but she has taken off her mufflings and is just as well as she ever was.”"
"“真是令人费解！”迪迈说。","“It is incomprehensible!” said Dumay."
"“一点儿也不费解，”公证人说，“事情现在已经一清二楚了。”","“Not at all,” said the notary; “it is now as clear as day.”"
"“孩子，”莫黛斯特回到客厅里，后面跟着比查，她一进来米尼翁夫人就问道，“今天早晨你在教堂有没有看见一个穿着入时、扣眼里插着一支白玫瑰的年轻人？”","“My child,” said Madame Mignon to Modeste, as she came into the room, followed by Butscha, “did you see a well-dressed young man at church this morning, with a white rose in his button-hole?”"
"“我看到他了，”比查看到大家神情都有些紧张，觉得莫黛斯特很可能会中圈套，就赶紧说道，“他叫葛兰杜，著名的建筑师，镇上正跟他商量修复教堂的事。他刚从巴黎过来，早晨我在去圣阿德雷斯的路上，看到他正在考察教堂的外部情况。”","“I saw him,” said Butscha quickly, perceiving by everybody’s strained attention that Modeste was likely to fall into a trap.“It was Grindot, the famous architect, with whom the town is in treaty for the restoration of the church.He has just come from Paris, and I met him this morning examining the exterior as I was on my way to Sainte-Adresse.”"
"“噢，他是个建筑师吗？让我好生奇怪。”莫黛斯特说道，比查已经为她赢得了镇定下来的时间。","“Oh, an architect, was he? he puzzled me,” said Modeste, for whom Butscha had thus gained time to recover herself."
"迪迈斜着眼看着比查。莫黛斯特已经完全警醒，恢复了她那高深莫测的镇定。迪迈的怀疑现在已经完全被激发了，他决定第二天早晨就到镇长办公室去确认一下那位建筑师今天是不是真来勒阿弗尔了。另一方面，比查也同样坚决地要去巴黎调查有关卡那利的事。","Dumay looked askance at Butscha.Modeste, fully warned, recovered her impenetrable composure.Dumay’s distrust was now thoroughly aroused, and he resolved to go the mayor’s office early in the morning and ascertain if the architect had really been in Havre the previous day.Butscha, on the other hand, was equally determined to go to Paris and find out something about Canalis."
"哥本海姆来玩牌了，他的出现减轻并压制了所有人的燥动情绪。莫黛斯特焦躁不安地等着母亲就寝时间的到来。她想写信，但只有夜里才能写。全世界都入睡后，她的爱指引她写下了这封信——","Gobenheim came to play whist, and by his presence subdued and compressed all this fermentation of feelings.Modeste awaited her mother’s bedtime with impatience.She intended to write, but never did so except at night.Here is the letter which love dictated to her while all the world was sleeping:—"
"致德卡那利先生：啊！我的朋友，我心爱的人儿！那些摆在橱窗里的画像真是虚假透顶啊！而我，竟然把那幅可怕的石版画当作我的快乐！——一想到爱上了一个如此英俊的人，我就自卑。不，那些巴黎女人不可能笨到这种程度，看不到您能实现他们的美梦。什么您受到冷落！什么您没人爱！您告诉我的您孤独而又暗淡的生活，还有您渴望找到一位偶像——到如今都没有找到的偶像——我一个字都不相信了。先生，您是被爱腻了，您那如木兰叶一样洁白光亮的额头就说明了这一点，而我才是真正被忽略的——我算什么呢？啊！您为什么要唤醒我的生命呢？有一刻，我感觉肉体的重负仿佛正在离开我，我的灵魂已经打破了俘虏它的水晶罩，遍及了我整个身心，有形之物的冷漠已经不复存在，大自然中的所有东西都发出声音与我交谈。古老的教堂在闪闪发光。教堂的拱形顶，就像一座意大利大教堂那样发出金色和天蓝色的光芒，在我的头顶闪耀。天使为殉道者们唱的美妙歌曲从管风琴中流淌而出，平息了他们的痛苦。勒阿弗尔那粗糙不平的路面对我的脚来说，就像是一片华丽的草地，大海用怜悯的嗓音与我交谈，就像一位我从未真正理解的老朋友。我清楚地看到，自己花园里的玫瑰长久以来是如何崇拜我、向我示爱，我从教堂回来时，它们就抬起头，朝我微笑。我听到着您的名字“梅尔基奥尔”在钟状的花朵中回响，我看到了它被写在云朵上。是的，是的，我活了，我正活着，谢谢您——我的诗人，您比那个冷酷、传统的拜伦爵士英俊多了，他的脸就像英国的天气一样阴沉。您的一瞥，您那东方眼神的一瞥，便刺穿了我的双层面纱，将您的血液注入到了我的心脏，又流入我的头和双脚。啊！那不是母亲给予我们的那种生命。在您疼痛的那一刻，我也会感到疼痛——我的生命只通过您的思想而存在。我现在明白了音乐那神奇的力量有什么作用，是天使创造了音乐来表达爱情。啊，我的梅尔基奥尔，同时拥有天才和美貌也太过分了，应该让每个人出生时只能选择其一。","To Monsieur de Canalis,—Ah! my friend, my well-beloved!What atrocious falsehoods those portraits in the shop-windows are!And I, who made that horrible lithograph my joy!—I am humbled at the thought of loving one so handsome.No; it is impossible that those Parisian women are so stupid as not to have seen their dreams fulfilled in you.You neglected! you unloved!I do not believe a word of all that you have written me about your lonely and obscure life, your hunger for an idol,—sought in vain until now.You have been too well loved, monsieur; your brow, white and smooth as a magnolia leaf, reveals it; and it is I who must be neglected,—for who am I?Ah! why have you called me to life?I felt for a moment as though the heavy burden of the flesh was leaving me; my soul had broken the crystal which held it captive; it pervaded my whole being; the cold silence of material things had ceased; all things in nature had a voice and spoke to me.The old church was luminous.It’s arched roof, brilliant with gold and azure like those of an Italian cathedral, sparkled above my head.Melodies such as the angels sang to martyrs, quieting their pains, sounded from the organ.The rough pavements of Havre seemed to my feet a flowery mead; the sea spoke to me with a voice of sympathy, like an old friend whom I had never truly understood.I saw clearly how the roses in my garden had long adored me and bidden me love; they lifted their heads and smiled as I came back from church.I heard your name, “Melchior,” chiming in the flower-bells; I saw it written on the clouds.Yes, yes, I live, I am living, thanks to thee,—my poet, more beautiful than that cold, conventional Lord Byron, with a face as dull as the English climate.One glance of thine, thine Orient glance, pierced through my double veil and sent thy blood to my heart, and from thence to my head and feet.Ah! that is not the life our mother gave us.A hurt to thee would hurt me too at the very instant it was given,—my life exists by thy thought only.I know now the purpose of the divine faculty of music; the angels invented it to utter love.Ah, my Melchior, to have genius and to have beauty is too much; a man should be made to choose between them at his birth."
"您给了我宝贵的温柔和热情，特别是上个月，想到这些，我就会问自己是不是在做梦。不，我不是在做梦，但您隐藏了某些秘密，什么样的女人能把您交出来给我？除非是她死了。啊！嫉妒已经随着爱情——我不敢相信的爱情——步入了我的内心。我当初怎能想象到这熊熊爱火？而现在——真奇怪，真莫名，真讨厌！——我情愿您长得丑些。","When I think of the treasures of tenderness and affection which you have given me, and more especially for the last month, I ask myself if I dream.No, but you hide some mystery; what woman can yield you up to me and not die?Ah! jealousy has entered my heart with love,—love in which I could not have believed.How could I have imagined so mighty a conflagration?And now—strange and inconceivable revulsion!—I would rather you were ugly."
"回家之后，我干了哪些蠢事啊！黄色的大丽花让我想起了您的背心，白色的玫瑰都是我亲爱的朋友。我用属于您的目光向它们致意，好像整个我都属于您一样。那紧裹着一位绅士双手的手套的颜色，您沿着教堂中殿留下的脚步——一切、一切都印在了我的记忆里，以至于再过六十年，这寻常日子里最精确的细节，都还会历历在目——包括空气中的颜色，闪烁在某根石柱上的光线。我会听到被您的脚步打断的祷告；我会呼吸到圣坛上的焚香；我永远都会感觉到我们头顶那双神父般的手，您在结尾祈福时经过我的身边，那双手就是在为我们祝福。这样看来，善良的马塞兰神父已经为我们证婚了！这个新世界充满了出人意料的激情，在这里我感觉到了超乎俗世的快乐，我把它告诉您，把它奉还给那如阳光般慷慨、把快乐注入我内心的人儿，也只有这种快乐，才能与您给我的快乐相提并论。亲爱的，我不再需要面纱了，不再需要伪装了。回到我这儿来吧，唉，快点来吧。我现在就高高兴兴地摘掉面具。","What follies I committed after I came home!The yellow dahlias reminded me of your waistcoat, the white roses were my loving friends; I bowed to them with a look that belonged to you, like all that is of me.The very color of the gloves, moulded to hands of a gentleman, your step along the nave,—all, all, is so printed on my memory that sixty years hence I shall see the veriest trifles of this day of days,—the color of the atmosphere, the ray of sunshine that flickered on a certain pillar; I shall hear the prayer your step interrupted; I shall inhale the incense of the altar; forever I shall feel above our heads the priestly hands that blessed us both as you passed by me at the closing benediction.The good Abbe Marcelin married us then!The happiness, above that of earth, which I feel in this new world of unexpected emotions can only be equalled by the joy of telling it to you, of sending it back to him who poured it into my heart with the lavishness of the sun itself.No more veils, no more disguises, my beloved.Come back to me, oh, come back soon.With joy I now unmask."
"您一定听说过勒阿弗尔的米尼翁家族吧？唉，经过一次不可弥补的不幸，我成了家族的唯一女嗣。但是，奥弗涅骑士的后裔，您可不要瞧不起我们，米尼翁·德拉巴斯蒂的家徽是不会让卡那利的家徽蒙羞的。我们的家徽是红色直纹加上一道黑色对角斜纹，斜纹上有四个金环纹章；盾形徽章分为四等块，每一块有一个表示主教的金十字；徽章的上部的饰章是一顶红衣主教帽子，两旁由领结状的图案支撑。亲爱的，我会信守我们家族的铭言：“Una fides, unus Dominus!”——真正的信仰，唯一的主人。","You have no doubt heard of the house of Mignon in Havre?Well, I am, through an irreparable misfortune, its sole heiress.But you are not to look down upon us, descendant of an Auvergne knight; the arms of the Mignon de La Bastie will do no dishonor to those of Canalis.We bear gules, on a bend sable four bezants or; quarterly four crosses patriarchal or; a cardinal’s hat as crest, and the fiocchi for supports.Dear, I will be faithful to our motto: “Una fides, unus Dominus!”—the true faith, and one only Master."
"我的朋友，我做了这么多，又在此说了这么多，您或许会觉得我的假名有点讽刺。我叫莫黛斯特。所以，我署名“欧·德埃斯特·莫”，是没有欺骗您的。至于我们的财产，我也没有骗您，我相信，我们的财产数目足以让您变得高贵。我知道，钱对您来说只是一个无关紧要的因素，因此，说起钱财，我是毫无保留的。让我告诉您，我是多么高兴，我们的财产能让我给我们的幸福带来行动的自由——当我们想旅游时，我能说：“来吧，让我们乘一辆舒适的马车，肩并肩坐着，不用担心钱的问题”——简言之，我多么高兴能跟国王说：“您要求贵族拥有的财产，我有。”这样，莫黛斯特·米尼翁就能为您效劳，她的金钱将会有最高贵的用途。","Perhaps, my friend, you will find some irony in my name, after all that I have done, and all that I herein avow.I am named Modeste.Therefore I have not deceived you by signing “O. d’Este M.”Neither have I misled you about our fortune; it will amount, I believe, to the sum which rendered you so virtuous.I know that to you money is a consideration of small importance; therefore I speak of it without reserve.Let me tell you how happy it makes me to give freedom of action to our happiness,—to be able to say, when the fancy for travel takes us, “Come, let us go in a comfortable carriage, sitting side by side, without a thought of money”—happy, in short, to tell the king, “I have the fortune which you require in your peers.”Thus Modeste Mignon can be of service to you, and her gold will have the noblest of uses."
"至于您的仆人她本人——您确实已见过她一次，就在她的窗户旁。是的，“金发夏娃最美丽的女儿”正是您不知名的少女，但今天的莫黛斯特，与许久以前的她，是多么不一样啊！以前的莫黛斯特是在她的寿衣里的，而如今的莫黛斯特——我跟您说明白了吗？——已经从您那得到了生命的精髓。我们的爱情是纯洁的，而且会得到认可，我的父亲正带着财富与成功回来，他会批准这一爱情。正是这份爱，用它有力而又稚嫩的手将我从沉睡的坟墓里唤起。您已将我唤醒，就像太阳唤醒花朵那样。您所爱之人的双眼，不再属于那个因无知而胆大包天的小莫黛斯特了——不，幸福太耀眼了，我把眼帘闭上了。今天，我倒担心自己永远都配不上这命运了。国王满载荣誉而归，我的君主现在有了一个臣女，她请求他原谅自己的冒昧，就像欺骗了德格拉蒙先生的赌徒带着作弊的骰子一样。","As to your servant herself,—you did see her once, at her window.Yes, “the fairest daughter of Eve the fair” was indeed your unknown damozel; but how little the Modeste of today resembles her of that long past era!That one was in her shroud, this one—have I made you know it?—has received from you the life of life.Love, pure, and sanctioned, the love my father, now returning rich and prosperous, will authorize, has raised me with its powerful yet childlike hand from the grave in which I slept.You have wakened me as the sun wakens the flowers.The eyes of your beloved are no longer those of the little Modeste so daring in her ignorance,—no, they are dimmed with the sight of happiness, and the lids close over them.Today I tremble lest I can never deserve my fate.The king has come in his glory; my lord has now a subject who asks pardon for the liberties she has taken, like the gambler with loaded dice after cheating Monsieur de Grammont."
"我珍爱的诗人！我将是您的米尼翁——我远比歌德的米尼翁幸福，因为您将把我留在我自己的领土——您的心上。就在我写下这篇我们婚约的誓词时，维尔坎花园里的一只夜莺替您作了回答。啊，它的歌喉是如此纯净，如此清晰，如此饱满，像一份天使传报书，让我的心里充满了快乐和爱意。快告诉我，它的歌声没有对我撒谎。","My cherished poet!I will be thy Mignon—happier far than the Mignon of Goethe, for thou wilt leave me in mine own land,—in thy heart.Just as I write this pledge of our betrothal a nightingale in the Vilquin park answers for thee.Ah, tell me quick that his note, so pure, so clear, so full, which fills my heart with joy and love like an Annunciation, does not lie to me."
"我的父亲从马赛途经巴黎而归，他同蒙日诺商号保持着联系，他们知道他的地址。去见他吧，我的梅尔基奥尔，告诉他您爱我，但是别告诉他我多么爱您——让这一点永远成为我们和上帝之间的秘密吧。而我，亲爱的人儿，我将把一切都告诉我的母亲。她的心将证明我的的行为是对的，她将为我们如此浪漫、集人间与天堂于一身的秘密诗篇而感到欣喜。","My father will pass through Paris on his way from Marseilles; the house of Mongenod, with whom he corresponds, will know his address.Go to him, my Melchior, tell him that you love me; but do not try to tell him how I love you,—let that be forever between ourselves and God.I, my dear one, am about to tell everything to my mother.Her heart will justify my conduct; she will rejoice in our secret poem, so romantic, human and divine in one."
"您已经有了他们女儿的告白，现在，您必须取得您的莫黛斯特的父亲——德拉巴斯蒂伯爵的同意。","You have the confession of the daughter; you must now obtain the consent of the Comte de La Bastie, father of your Modeste."
"附言——最重要的是，在没有得到我父亲的同意之前，千万别到勒阿弗尔来。如果您爱我，您一定能在他途经巴黎的路上找到他。","P.S.—Above all, do not come to Havre without having first obtained my father’s consent.If you love me you will not fail to find him on his way through Paris."
"“莫黛斯特小姐，都这个时候了，您还醒着干吗？”迪迈在她门口说道。","“What are you doing, up at this hour, Mademoiselle Modeste?” said the voice of Dumay at her door."
"“给我父亲写信，”她答道，“你不是告诉我明天早晨出发吗？”","“Writing to my father,” she answered; “did you not tell me you should start in the morning?”"
"对此，迪迈无话可说，就回去睡觉了。莫黛斯特便又写了一封长长的信，这次是写给她父亲的。","Dumay had nothing to say to that, and he went to bed, while Modeste wrote another long letter, this time to her father."
"第二天早晨，弗朗索瓦丝·科歇收到了埃内斯特前一天晚上寄给她的信，见上面盖的是勒阿弗尔的邮戳，她吓了一跳，便把下面这封信交给了她的女主人，并带走了莫黛斯特写的那封信：","On the morrow, Francois Cochet, terrified at seeing the Havre postmark on the envelope which Ernest had mailed the night before, brought her young mistress the following letter and took away the one which Modeste had written:—"
"致欧·德埃斯特·莫小姐：我的心告诉我，您就是那位坐在拉图奈尔先生和夫人之间、小心翼翼戴着面纱，并精心乔装打扮过的女子。拉图奈尔夫妇只有一个孩子，还是个儿子。啊，我的爱，如果您身份普通、没有家族名望、没有重要地位，甚至没有钱，您不知道那会让我多高兴啊。您此时应该理解我的心情了，您为什么不告诉我实情呢？我不是一位诗人——除了在心里，在爱情面前，在您面前，我才是诗人。唉！在我的内心，有着怎样的情感力量，才能让我呆在这个旅馆里，而不是登上从我的窗户便可以看得到的安古维尔山上去。您会像我爱您一样爱我吗？我是怀着多么忐忑不安的心情离开勒阿弗尔的！难道我不是像犯了罪一样，因为爱您而受到惩罚吗？但我还是盲目地服从了您。请尽快给我写封信吧，因为如果您说您是故弄玄虚的话，那我就是以故弄玄虚对故弄玄虚，而我最后必须扔掉我的面具，告诉您我是哪种诗人，并放弃我借来的光荣。","To Mademoiselle O. d’Este M.,—My heart tells me that you were the woman so carefully veiled and disguised, and seated between Monsieur and Madame Latournelle, who have but one child, a son.Ah, my love, if you have only a modest station, without distinction, without importance, without money even, you do not know how happy that would make me.You ought to understand me by this time; why will you not tell me the truth?I am no poet,—except in heart, through love, through you.Oh! what power of affection there is in me to keep me here in this hotel, instead of mounting to Ingouville which I can see from my windows.Will you ever love me as I love you?To leave Havre in such uncertainty!Am I not punished for loving you as if I had committed a crime?But I obey you blindly.Let me have a letter quickly, for if you have been mysterious, I have returned you mystery for mystery, and I must at last throw off my disguise, show you the poet that I am, and abdicate my borrowed glory."
"这封信让莫黛斯特极其不安。她反复读着最后几行字，想弄明白其中的含义。而在这之前她让弗朗索瓦丝带走的信，是拿不回来了。但她回到自己的房间，回了一封信，要求马上得到一个解释。","This letter made Modeste terribly uneasy.She could not get back the one which Francoise had carried away before she came to the last words, whose meaning she now sought by reading them again and again; but she went to her own room and wrote an answer in which she demanded an immediate explanation."
"第十四章 事情复杂了","Chapter XIV Maters Grown Complicated"
"就在这些小事发生的同时，另一些小事也正在勒阿弗尔上演着，这些事让莫黛斯特忘记了眼前的不安。迪迈一早就到勒阿弗尔去了，并且很快就发现，前一天并没有什么建筑师到过镇上。他对比查的谎言感到很生气，因为这泄露了一个阴谋。他决定弄明白到底是怎么回事，便从镇长办公室跑到他的朋友拉图奈尔那里。","During these little events other little events were going on in Havre, which caused Modeste to forget her present uneasiness.Dumay went down to Havre early in the morning, and soon discovered that no architect had been in town the day before.Furious at Butscha’s lie, which revealed a conspiracy of which he was resolved to know the meaning, he rushed from the mayor’s office to his friend Latournelle."
"“你的比查先生在哪儿？”他见文书没在事务所，便向公证人问道。","“Where’s your Master Butscha?” he demanded of the notary, when he saw that the clerk was not in his place."
"“我亲爱的朋友比查去巴黎了。他今天早晨在码头上从一个瑞士水手那儿听到了一些他父亲的消息。好像是他父亲去过印度群岛，服侍过一位王子什么的，现在在巴黎。”","“Butscha, my dear fellow, has gone to Paris.He heard some news of his father this morning on the quays, from a Swedish sailor.It seems the father went to the Indies and served a prince, or something, and he is now in Paris.”"
"“瞎扯！都是骗人的！无耻！如果我坐快车去巴黎找他，一定会找到那该死的矮子的！”迪迈大叫道，“比查骗我们，他知道一些莫黛斯特的事情，却没有告诉我们。如果他参与了这件事，那他永远都别想当公证人了。我要让他回到他出生时的烂泥巴里去，我要——”","“Lies! it’s all a trick! infamous!I’ll find that damned cripple if I’ve got to go express to Paris for him,” cried Dumay.“Butscha is deceiving us; he knows something about Modeste, and hasn’t told us.If he meddles in this thing he shall never be a notary.I’ll roll him in the mud from which he came, I’ll—”"
"“好了，好了，我的朋友，永远不要在审判一个人之前就把他绞死了。”拉图奈尔被迪迈的怒火吓到了，说道。","“Come, come, my friend; never hang a man before you try him,” said Latournelle, frightened at Dumay’s rage."
"迪迈将他怀疑的根据都列出来之后，请求拉图奈尔夫人在他外出期间到木屋去呆着。","After stating the facts on which his suspicions were founded, Dumay begged Madame Latournelle to go and stay at the Chalet during his absence."
"“你在巴黎会找到中校的，”公证人说，“今天早晨的《商业日报》上，在‘航海新闻’那一栏里，我看到马赛港——这儿，你自己看吧，”他拿出报纸说道，“‘贝蒂娜·米尼翁号，船长米尼翁，十月六号入港’，今天十七号了，那么上校现在肯定在巴黎。”","“You will find the colonel in Paris,” said the notary.“In the shipping news quoted this morning in the Journal of Commerce, I found under the head of Marseilles—here, see for yourself,” he said, offering the paper.“‘The Bettina Mignon, Captain Mignon, arrived October 6’; it is now the 17th, and the colonel is sure to be in Paris.”"
"迪迈向哥本海姆请求辞去银号的工作，然后就返回木屋。他到的时候，莫黛斯特正把给她父亲和卡那利的两封信封起来。除了地址之外，两封信的外表和重量都完全一样。莫黛斯特以为她把给父亲的信放在了给她的梅尔基奥的信上面，但实际上恰恰相反。这种生活琐事中常常发生的小差错，恰好让迪迈和她的母亲发现了她的秘密。迪迈当时正在客厅里，情绪激动地跟米尼翁夫人谈话，向她诉说莫黛斯特的表里不一以及比查的纵容默许给他造成的新的恐慌。","Dumay requested Gobenheim to do without him in future, and then went back to the Chalet, which he reached just as Modeste was sealing her two letters, to her father and Canalis.Except for the address the letters were precisely alike both in weight and appearance.Modeste thought she had laid that to her father over that to her Melchior, but had, in fact, done exactly the reverse.This mistake, so often made in the little things of life, occasioned the discovery of her secret by Dumay and her mother.The former was talking vehemently to Madame Mignon in the salon, and revealing to her his fresh fears caused by Modeste’s duplicity and Butscha’s connivance."
"“夫人，”他喊道，“他是一条毒蛇，我们还把他放在胸口暖和过，可他那扭曲的小身板里，连颗良心都容不下！”","“Madame,” he cried, “he is a serpent whom we have warmed in our bosoms; there’s no place in his contorted little body for a soul!”"
"莫黛斯特把给她父亲的信装在她围裙的口袋里，以为那是给卡那利的，然后手里拿着写给她情人的信下楼来，在迪迈动身去巴黎之前见见他。","Modeste put the letter for her father into the pocket of her apron, supposing it to be that for Canalis, and came downstairs with the letter for her lover in her hand, to see Dumay before he started for Paris."
"“我的黑侏儒怎么了？你为什么要在这儿大喊大叫啊！”她站在门口说道。","“What has happened to my Black Dwarf? why are you talking so loud!” she said, appearing at the door."
"“小姐，比查去了巴黎，而您毫无疑问，知道为什么——他接着跟那个穿黄背心的小建筑师搞鬼去了。那小驼子撒了谎，也该他倒霉，那个建筑师根本就没来过这里。”","“Mademoiselle, Butscha has gone to Paris, and you, no doubt, know why,—to carry on that affair of the little architect with the sulphur waistcoat, who, unluckily for the hunchback’s lies, has never been here.”"
"莫黛斯特吓呆了，脸色变得苍白，跌坐下去。她感觉小矮子肯定是去调查她诗人的品行了。","Modeste was struck dumb; feeling sure that the dwarf had departed on a mission of inquiry as to her poet’s morals, she turned pale, and sat down."
"“我要去追他，我会找到他的。”迪迈接着说，“那是给您父亲的信吗，小姐？”他伸出手，补充道，“我会把它带去蒙日诺。上帝保佑中校和我不要在路上走岔了。”","“I’m going after him; I shall find him,” continued Dumay.“Is that the letter for your father, mademoiselle?” he added, holding out his hand.“I will take it to the Mongenods.God grant the colonel and I may not pass each other on the road.”"
"莫黛斯特把信交给了他。迪迈下意识地看了着地址。","Modeste gave him the letter.Dumay looked mechanically at the address."
"“‘天堂-鱼贩子街二十九号，德卡那利男爵先生’！”他大叫道，“这是什么意思？”","“‘Monsieur le Baron de Canalis, rue de Paradis-Poissoniere, No. 29’!” he cried out; “what does that mean?”"
"“啊，我的女儿！他就是你爱的人，”米尼翁夫人惊呼道，“你配乐的诗句是他写的——”","“Ah, my daughter! that is the man you love,” exclaimed Madame Mignon; “the stanzas you set to music were his—”"
"“还有，你楼上相框里就是他的画像。”迪迈补充道。","“And that’s his portrait that you have in a frame upstairs,” added Dumay."
"“把信还给我，迪迈先生。”莫黛斯特像一只保护幼崽的母狮一样站了起来，说道。","“Give me back that letter, Monsieur Dumay,” said Modeste, erecting herself like a lioness defending her cubs."
"“给你，小姐。”他答道。","“There it is, mademoiselle,” he replied."
"莫黛斯特把它放到胸衣里，又把那封给她父亲的信给了迪迈。","Modeste put it into the bosom of her dress, and gave Dumay the one intended for her father."
"“我知道你能干出什么事来，迪迈，”她说，“如果你靠近德卡那利先生一步，我就会走出这座房子一步，永远都不会回来。”","“I know what you are capable of, Dumay,” she said; “and if you take one step against Monsieur de Canalis, I shall take another out of this house, to which I will never return.”"
"“您会要了您母亲的命的，小姐。”迪迈答道，随后便走出客厅去叫他的妻子。","“You will kill your mother, mademoiselle,” replied Dumay, who left the room and called his wife."
"这位可怜的母亲真的快晕过去了——莫黛斯特的话对她的心是一记重击。","The poor mother was indeed half-fainting,—struck to the heart by Modeste’s words."
"“再见了，老伴，”布列塔尼人亲吻了他的美国妻子，说道，“照顾好她母亲，我去救这个女儿。”","“Good-bye, wife,” said the Breton, kissing the American.“Take care of the mother; I go to save the daughter.”"
"他几分钟就为旅途做好了准备，并启程去勒阿弗尔。一个小时后，他就坐在去巴黎的邮车上了。只有激情，或是投机生意，才能让车轮转得这么匆忙。","He made his preparations for the journey in a few minutes, and started for Havre.An hour later he was travelling post to Paris, with the haste that nothing but passion or speculation can get out of wheels."
"米尼翁夫人在莫黛斯特的悉心照料下恢复过来了，并由女儿搀扶着回到了卧房。等她们单独在一起的时候，她对女儿说了唯一一句责怪的话：","Recovering herself under Modeste’s tender care, Madame Mignon went up to her bedroom leaning on the arm of her daughter, to whom she said, as her sole reproach, when they were alone:—"
"“我不幸的孩子，看看你做了什么啊！你为什么什么事都瞒着我呢？我就那么严厉吗？”","“My unfortunate child, see what you have done!Why did you conceal anything from me?Am I so harsh?”"
"“唉！我正准备轻轻松松地告诉您呢。”莫黛斯特呜咽道。","“Oh! I was just going to tell it to you comfortably,” sobbed Modeste."
"于是她把所有的事情都告诉了她母亲，给她读自己写的信和对方的回信，并把自己诗篇的玫瑰一片一片摘下来，撒在这位善良的德国女人心头上。这一番知心话花了半天时间，结束时，莫黛斯特看到这位过于宽容的母亲唇边几乎浮现出了一丝微笑。她痛哭流涕地扑到母亲胸前。","She thereupon related everything to her mother, read her the letters and their answers, and shed the rose of her poem petal by petal into the heart of the kind German woman.When this confidence, which took half the day, was over, when she saw something that was almost a smile on the lips of the too indulgent mother, Modeste fell upon her breast in tears."
"“啊，母亲！”她啜泣着说道，“您的心多么高贵，多么富有诗情，它是上帝精心挑选的用来盛放神圣爱情的瓷瓶，它盛放着独一无二、终生不渝的天堂之爱。我希望效仿您，只爱我丈夫一个人——您一定明白我现在流的是多么辛酸的泪水。这只蝴蝶，我思想的灵魂，这颗我已用母性的关心、我的爱、我神圣的爱来哺育的双重心灵，这个绝对的秘密——就要落入世俗的手中了。他们会撕破它透明的翅膀，撕破它的面纱，他们有一个可悲的借口，说是要为我弄清天才是否同银行家一样谨慎精明，我的梅尔基奥是否有存款，或者是否有什么私情要了断。他们想要弄清楚，他是否有着中产阶级眼中那些年轻人的轻率之举——这一切对于我们爱情的太阳来说，就像是黎明的乌云。爱！我们的爱会怎样呢？他们会做什么呢？您看！摸摸我的手，它正在发烧。啊！我再也活不下去了。”","“Oh, mother!” she said amid her sobs, “you, whose heart, all gold and poetry, is a chosen vessel, chosen of God to hold a sacred love, a single and celestial love that endures for life; you, whom I wish to imitate by loving no one but my husband,—you will surely understand what bitter tears I am now shedding.This butterfly, this Psyche of my thoughts, this dual soul which I have nurtured with maternal care, my love, my sacred love, this living mystery of mysteries—it is about to fall into vulgar hands, and they will tear its diaphanous wings and rend its veil under the miserable pretext of enlightening me, of discovering whether genius is as prudent as a banker, whether my Melchior has saved his money, or whether he has some entanglement to shake off; they want to find out if he is guilty to bourgeois eyes of youthful indiscretions,—which to the sun of our love are like the clouds of the dawn.Oh! what will come of it? what will they do?See! feel my hand, it burns with fever.Ah! I shall never survive it.”"
"莫黛斯特真的在打寒颤，只好去床上躺着，这让她母亲、拉图奈尔夫人和迪迈夫人十分不安，她们在中尉去巴黎期间精心照料着莫黛斯特——出于事情发展的逻辑，我们要暂时把剧情转向巴黎。","And Modeste, really taken with a chill, was forced to go to bed, causing serious uneasiness to her mother, Madame Latournelle, and Madame Dumay, who took good care of her during the journey of the lieutenant to Paris,—to which city the logic of events compels us to transport our drama for a moment."
"像埃内斯特·德拉布里埃这样真正谦逊的人，特别是那些知道自己的价值、也知道自己既没人爱也没人欣赏的人，一定能理解这位年轻文书阅读莫黛斯特的来信时，沉浸在何等无边的快乐中。他那年轻、纯真、爱捣蛋的情人，先是觉得他心灵高尚、有才智，现在又觉得他长得英俊，这难道是真的吗？这种夸奖是至高无上的夸奖。为什么呢？毫无疑问，美，是大师在倾注了其心血的作品上的签名，是天意的显露。而在不美的地方看到美，用一种内在的洞察力来创造美——这难道不是爱情的最高境界吗？于是，这可怜的年轻人就像一个受到嘉许的作家一样欣喜若狂，大声喊道：“我终于有人爱了！”一个女人，不管她是少女、妻子还是寡妇，当她说出“你很英俊”这令人陶醉的几个字时，就算是虚情假意，男人也会朝着这剂隐秘的毒药打开他们厚厚的脑壳。从此，他就被一条永久的绳索系在这位可爱的奉承者身上，系在这位或真心或假意的法官身上，她成了他独特的世界，而他，则渴望她不断的证词，而且，即使他是一个戴着皇冠的王子，也永远不会感到厌倦。埃内斯特自豪地在他的房间里走来走去，在镜子前半侧面、正面、侧面来回照，试着给自己挑毛病，但是，一个恶魔般令人信服的声音对他低声说：“莫黛斯特是对的。”他拿起她写的信，又读了一遍，他看到了那金发夏娃最漂亮的女儿，他跟她说着话。然而，就在狂喜之中，一个可怕的念头涌了上来：","Truly modest minds, like that of Ernest de La Briere, but especially those who, knowing their own value, also know that they are neither loved nor appreciated, can understand the infinite joy to which the young secretary abandoned himself on reading Modeste’s letter.Could it be that after thinking him lofty and witty in soul, his young, his artless, his tricksome mistress now thought him handsome?This flattery is the flattery supreme.And why?Beauty is, undoubtedly, the signature of the master to the work into which he has put his soul; it is the divine spirit manifested.And to see it where it is not, to create it by the power of an inward look,—is not that the highest reach of love?And so the poor youth cried aloud with all the rapture of an applauded author, “At last I am beloved!”When a woman, be she maid, wife, or widow, lets the charming words escape her, “Thou art handsome,” the words may be false, but the man opens his thick skull to their subtle poison, and thenceforth he is attached by an everlasting tie to the pretty flatterer, the true or the deceived judge; she becomes his particular world, he thirsts for her continual testimony, and he never wearies of it, even if he is a crowned prince.Ernest walked proudly up and down his room; he struck a three-quarter, full-face, and profile attitude before the glass; he tried to criticise himself; but a voice, diabolically persuasive, whispered to him, “Modeste is right.”He took up her letter and re-read it; he saw his fairest of the fair; he talked with her; then, in the midst of his ecstacy, a dreadful thought came to him:—"
"“她以为我是卡那利，而且她拥有上百万财产！”","“She thinks me Canalis, and she has a million of money!”"
"他的幸福顿时垮掉了，就像一个梦游症患者走到屋顶上，听到一个声音，醒来了，然后摔到地上，粉身碎骨。","Down went his happiness, just as a somnambulist, having attained the peak of a roof, hears a voice, awakes, and falls crushed upon the pavement."
"“没有了荣誉的光环，我在她的眼中就会是丑陋无比的，”他大叫道，“我这是把自己置于一个多么疯狂的境地啊！”","“Without the halo of fame I shall be hideous in her eyes,” he cried; “what a maddening situation I have put myself in!”"
"拉布里埃确实如我们读到的信中那样，他的心太高贵、太纯洁，事关荣誉的事情，他会毫不犹豫。他立刻决定，如果莫黛斯特的父亲在巴黎的话，就去找他，并向他坦白一切，还要让卡那利知道他们巴黎式的玩笑所带来的严重后果。对于他这样生性敏感的人来说，莫黛斯特的大笔财富本身就是一个决定性因素。他甚至不允许别人怀疑他热情洋溢的信件是想骗取一笔“嫁妆”，那些信对他而言是如此真诚。在去尚特雷纳街找银行主蒙日诺的路上，他的眼里噙满了泪水。这位银行主的财产和生意关系网，有一部分也是那位帮埃内斯特事业起步的大臣帮忙的结果。","La Briere was too much the man of his letters which we have read, his heart was too noble and pure to allow him to hesitate at the call of honor.He at once resolved to find Modeste’s father, if he were in Paris, and confess all to him, and to let Canalis know the serious results of their Parisian jest.To a sensitive nature like his, Modeste’s large fortune was in itself a determining reason.He could not allow it to be even suspected that the ardor of the correspondence, so sincere on his part, had in view the capture of a “dot.”Tears were in his eyes as he made his way to the rue Chantereine to find the banker Mongenod, whose fortune and business connections were partly the work of the minister to whom Ernest owed his start in life."
"就在拉布里埃向蒙日诺商号老板询问他深爱之人父亲的情况、获取对身处尴尬境地的他有所帮助的信息时，卡那利的书房里发生了戏剧性的一幕。这一幕，读者从那位前中尉匆忙离开勒阿弗尔就可以预见得到了。","At the hour when La Briere was inquiring about the father of his beloved from the head of the house of Mongenod, and getting information that might be useful to him in his strange position, a scene was taking place in Canalis’s study which the ex-lieutenant’s hasty departure from Havre may have led the reader to foresee."
"迪迈就像一位真正的帝国军校的士兵，去巴黎的一路上，他那布列塔尼人的血液一直在沸腾。他觉得诗人应该是一个干瘦、可怜、无足轻重的家伙——是一个醉心于遣词造句的小丑，住在阁楼里，穿着每条衣缝都已发白的黑衣服，脚上的靴子有时连鞋跟都没有，身上的亚麻布衣不堪入目，手指上沾过的墨水比肥皂多得多。简单地说，就是一个除了偶尔像比查那样坐在桌前奋笔疾书之外，怎么看都像从月球滚来的人。但是，当这位布列塔尼人走进诗人那漂亮宅第的院子，他看见一个马夫正在洗马车，还透过一间富丽堂皇的餐厅的窗户里，看到一个穿得像银行家的贴身男仆。马夫朝男仆指了指迪迈，而男仆则把这个陌生人上下打量了一番，回答说男爵先生不能见客。这一切都给他心头和脑海沸腾的思绪重重泼了一瓢冷水。“男爵先生今天要出席国务院的一个会议。”那仆人补充道。","Like a true soldier of the imperial school, Dumay, whose Breton blood had boiled all the way to Paris, considered a poet to be a poor stick of a fellow, of no consequence whatever,—a buffoon addicted to choruses, living in a garret, dressed in black clothes that were white at every seam, wearing boots that were occasionally without soles, and linen that was unmentionable, and whose fingers knew more about ink than soap; in short, one who looked always as if he had tumbled from the moon, except when scribbling at a desk, like Butscha.But the seething of the Breton’s heart and brain received a violent application of cold water when he entered the courtyard of the pretty house occupied by the poet and saw a groom washing a carriage, and also, through the windows of a handsome dining-room, a valet dressed like a banker, to whom the groom referred him, and who answered, looking the stranger over from head to foot, that Monsieur le baron was not visible.“There is,” added the man, “a meeting of the council of state today, at which Monsieur le baron is obliged to be present.”"
"“这真的是诗人卡那利先生的宅邸吗？”迪迈说。","“Is this really the house of Monsieur Canalis,” said Dumay, “a writer of poetry?”"
"“德卡那利男爵先生，”仆人回答道，“就是你所说的伟大诗人，但他也是外交部行政法院的主席。”","“Monsieur le baron de Canalis,” replied the valet, “is the great poet of whom you speak; but he is also the president of the court of Claims attached to the ministry of foreign affairs.”"
"迪迈本是来扇那个无足轻重的小文人耳光的，却发现面对的是一个高级政府官员。仆人请他去客厅里等候，这间客厅又引起了他的无限遐思。客厅里有一件仆人忘在椅子上的黑色外套，上面的荣誉军团勋章闪闪发光。这时候，他的目光被一只漂亮而又光彩夺目的镀银杯所吸引，杯子上刻着“夫人赠”几个字。然后，他又看到面前的一只塞夫尔花瓶的底座上刻着“王太子妃赠”。","Dumay, who had come to box the ears of a scribbling nobody, found himself confronted by a high functionary of the state.The salon where he was told to wait offered, as a topic for his meditations, the insignia of the Legion of honor glittering on a black coat which the valet had left upon a chair.Presently his eyes were attracted by the beauty and brilliancy of a silver-gilt cup bearing the words “Given by Madame.”Then he beheld before him, on a pedestal, a Sevres vase on which was engraved, “The gift of Madame la Dauphine.”"
"这些无言的告诫让迪迈恢复了理智。与此同时，那位仆人去问他的主人是否愿意接见一个专程从勒阿弗尔赶来见他的人——一个叫迪迈的陌生人。","These mute admonitions brought Dumay to his senses while the valet went to ask his master if he would receive a person who had come from Havre expressly to see him,—a stranger named Dumay."
"“什么样的人？”卡那利问。","“What sort of a man?” asked Canalis."
"“穿着体面，戴着荣誉军团勋章。”","“He is well-dressed, and wears the ribbon of the Legion of honor.”"
"卡那利做了一个同意的手势，仆人便退下了，然后回去通报道：“迪迈先生到。”","Canalis made a sign of assent, and the valet retreated, and then returned and announced, “Monsieur Dumay.”"
"当迪迈听到自己的名字，当他走进一件华丽而又雅致的书房，站在卡那利面前，脚下的地毯比米尼翁家任何一条都气派得多，当他看到正摆弄着华丽晨衣上的流苏的卡那利投来打量的眼神时，迪迈完全惊呆了，竟让这位伟大的诗人抢先说话了。","When he heard himself announced, when he was actually in presence of Canalis, in a study as gorgeous as it was elegant, with his feet on a carpet far handsomer than any in the house of Mignon, and when he met the studied glance of the poet who was playing with the tassels of a sumptuous dressing-gown, Dumay was so completely taken aback that he allowed the great poet to have the first word."
"“我怎么有幸得到您的拜访呢，先生？”","“To what do I owe the honor of your visit, monsieur?”"
"“先生。”迪迈还站着，就开了口。","“Monsieur,” began Dumay, who remained standing."
"“如果您有好多话要说，”卡那利打断他，说道，“那就请坐吧。”","“If you have a good deal to say,” interrupted Canalis, “I must ask you to be seated.”"
"接着，卡那利自己一屁股坐到一张伏尔泰式手扶椅上，翘起二郎腿，上面那条腿抬到眼睛那么高，目不转睛地看着迪迈。按照迪迈军队里的俗话，他像是“被捅了一刺刀”。","And Canalis himself plunged into an armchair a la Voltaire, crossed his legs, raised the upper one to the level of his eye and looked fixedly at Dumay, who became, to use his own martial slang, “bayonetted.”"
"“我听着呢，先生，”诗人说，“我的时间很宝贵——大臣们正在等我。”","“I am listening, monsieur,” said the poet; “my time is precious,—the ministers are expecting me.”"
"“先生，”迪迈说，“我会长话短说的。您引诱了——以什么方式，我不知道——一位勒阿弗尔的年轻小姐，她年轻、漂亮，而且很富有，是两个贵族家庭最后的、也是唯一的希望，而我是来问您这样做的意图何在。”","“Monsieur,” said Dumay, “I shall be brief.You have seduced—how, I do not know—a young lady in Havre, young, beautiful, and rich; the last and only hope of two noble families; and I have come to ask your intentions.”"
"在过去的三个月里，卡那利一直忙着他自己的要紧事，努力成为一位荣誉军团的指挥官，并被派到德国某个宫廷去当大使。他已经完全忘记了莫黛斯特写的信。","Canalis, who had been busy during the last three months with serious matters of his own, and was trying to get himself made commander of the Legion of honor and minister to a German court, had completely forgotten Modeste’s letter.”"
"“我！”他大叫一声。","“I!” he exclaimed."
"“是您！”迪迈重复道。","“You!” repeated Dumay."
"“先生，”卡那利笑着回答说，“我根本不知道您在讲什么，就好像您在讲希伯来语一样。我引诱了一位少女！我，一位——”一丝高傲的微笑从他脸上掠过，“算了吧，算了吧，先生，我拥有自己的果园和花园，里面有最好的熟桃子，我不会幼稚到去偷篱笆外的果子的。所有的巴黎人都知道我的心思在哪儿。很有可能，在勒阿弗尔会有某位少女对我的诗歌充满了热情——其实那些诗根本不配，那我倒一点儿也不会奇怪，这再正常不过了。您瞧！那个漂亮的乌木小匣子，装饰着珠母，边上镶着蕾丝一样精致的铁边。它原来是教皇利奥十世的，后来德肖利厄公爵夫人从西班牙国王得到它，又转送给了我。我用它来装生活在欧洲每个角落的夫人和少女们写给我的信。唉！我可以肯定地对您说，我对这些心灵的花朵有着最崇高的敬意，它们都是在充满激情的时刻被采摘下来送给我的，值得拥有所有的敬意。是的，对我来说，内心的冲动是最高贵、最令人赞叹的东西！其他人——嘲笑者——用这些信点烟，或者给他们的老婆当卷发纸，但我，我是单身，先生，我很仔细地把这些朴实的礼品——它们是如此纯洁、如此无私——保存在它们的神龛里。事实上，我是怀着一种崇敬之情将它们保护起来，而且，到我临死的时候，会叫人当着我的面把它们烧掉。人们可能会认为这很可笑，但我不在乎。我懂得感恩，这些热爱的证据使我能够承受文学生活的种种批评和烦恼。当我受到藏身于某家日报下的敌人的背后攻击时，我就看看那个匣子，心想——在这个广阔的世界上，到处都有一些心灵，它们的伤口被我治愈、抚慰，或者包扎起来！”","“Monsieur,” answered Canalis, smiling; “I know no more of what you are talking about than if you had said it in Hebrew.I seduce a young girl!I, who—” and a superb smile crossed his features.“Come, come, monsieur, I’m not such a child as to steal fruit over the hedges when I have orchards and gardens of my own where the finest peaches ripen.All Paris knows where my affections are set.Very likely there may be some young girl in Havre full of enthusiasm for my verses,—of which they are not worthy; that would not surprise me at all; nothing is more common.See! look at that lovely coffer of ebony inlaid with mother-of-pearl, and edged with that iron-work as fine as lace.That coffer belonged to Pope Leo X., and was given to me by the Duchesse de Chaulieu, who received it from the king of Spain.I use it to hold the letters I receive from ladies and young girls living in every quarter of Europe.Oh!I assure you I feel the utmost respect for these flowers of the soul, cut and sent in moments of enthusiasm that are worthy of all reverence.Yes, to me the impulse of a heart is a noble and sublime thing!Others—scoffers—light their cigars with such letters, or give them to their wives for curl-papers; but I, who am a bachelor, monsieur, I have too much delicacy not to preserve these artless offerings—so fresh, so disinterested—in a tabernacle of their own.In fact, I guard them with a species of veneration, and at my death they will be burned before my eyes.People may call that ridiculous, but I do not care.I am grateful; these proofs of devotion enable me to bear the criticisms and annoyances of a literary life.When I receive a shot in the back from some enemy lurking under cover of a daily paper, I look at that casket and think,—here and there in this wide world there are hearts whose wounds have been healed, or soothed, or dressed by me!”"
"中尉被这位伟大演员慷慨激昂、富有诗意的陈述惊呆了，眼睛睁得大大的。他惊讶的表情可逗坏了诗人。","This bit of poetry, declaimed with all the talent of a great actor, petrified the lieutenant, whose eyes opened to their utmost extent, and whose astonishment delighted the poet."
"“出于我对您身份的完全尊重，”这只开屏的孔雀接着说道，“我允许您打开那个匣子，找一找您那位年轻小姐的信。但我知道我是对的，那些名字我都记得，我敢肯定是您搞错了——”","“I will permit you,” continued the peacock, spreading his tail, “out of respect for your position, which I fully appreciate, to open that coffer and look for the letter of your young lady.Though I know I am right, I remember names, and I assure you you are mistaken in thinking—”"
"“一个可怜的孩子卷进了这个巴黎的漩涡，就变成这样了！”迪迈大声说道，“她是父母的宝贝，是朋友们的开心果，是所有人的希望，被所有人宠爱，是一个家族的骄傲！为了她，六个忠心耿耿的人情愿用他们的生命和财产，在她和悲伤之间筑起一座堡垒。先生，”迪迈停了一下说道，“您是一位伟大的诗人，而我只是一个可怜的军人。我为国家在部队服役十五年，许多颗子弹曾在我面前呼啸而过，我都成功躲过了，我到过西伯利亚，在那儿做过俘虏，俄国佬把我扔到篷车里，上帝知道我受过什么罪。我看见成千上万的战友死去——但您，您让我凉到了骨髓里，这是我之前从未尝过的滋味。”","“And this is what a poor child comes to in this gulf of Paris!” cried Dumay,—“the darling of her parents, the joy of her friends, the hope of all, petted by all, the pride of a family, who has six persons so devoted to her that they would willingly make a rampart of their lives and fortunes between her and sorrow.Monsieur,” Dumay remarked after a pause, “you are a great poet, and I am only a poor soldier.For fifteen years I served my country in the ranks; I have had the wind of many a bullet in my face; I have crossed Siberia and been a prisoner there; the Russians flung me on a kibitka, and God knows what I suffered.I have seen thousands of my comrades die,—but you, you have given me a chill to the marrow of my bones, such as I never felt before.”"
"迪迈以为他的话感动了诗人，但事实上，那些话只是奉承了他——在他生活的这个阶段，要打动他几乎是一件不可能的事了，因为他野心太大，早已忘记了赞扬在他头顶打碎的第一支香水瓶了。","Dumay fancied that his words moved the poet, but in fact they only flattered him,—a thing which at this period of his life had become almost an impossibility; for his ambitious mind had long forgotten the first perfumed phial that praise had broken over his head."
"“啊，我的军人！”他把手放在迪迈的肩头，一边严肃地说着，一边心想能让一个帝国的大兵发抖真是有意思，“这位少女对您来说，可能是全部的全部，但对于一个大社会来说，她算什么呢？什么都不算。此刻，中国一位最伟大的满清官吏可能正要断气，并让半个世界处于悲痛之中，而这对您来说算什么呢？英国正在印度杀戮成千上万比我们可敬的人，就在我跟您说话的这一刻，某个迷人的妇女正在被活活烧死——这让您今天早餐时少喝了一点儿咖啡了吗？在巴黎，每天都有穿着破烂的母亲把她的婴儿扔掉，让随便哪个看到的人捡去，然而，您看！这价值五个路易的杯子里，盛着美味的茶，而我写着诗歌，那些巴黎女人争相购买，呼喊道：‘天才啊！怡人哪！令人陶醉啊！精神的食粮啊！’社会这个大自然，也跟大自然本身一样，是十分健忘的。十年后，您会为今天的行为感到非常奇怪。您现在所在的城市，有人死去，有人结婚，有人约会时互相倾慕，少女们压抑着自己，天才同他那充满仁慈的思想一起沉没——所有这些人肩并着肩，有时候甚至在同一屋檐下，却互不相识、漠不关心。而您来到我们这儿，要求我们为这么一件寻常小事大呼痛苦。”","“Ah, my soldier!” he said solemnly, laying his hand on Dumay’s shoulder, and thinking to himself how droll it was to make a soldier of the empire tremble, “this young girl may be all in all to you, but to society at large what is she? nothing.At this moment the greatest mandarin in China may be yielding up the ghost and putting half the universe in mourning, and what is that to you?The English are killing thousands of people in India more worthy than we are; why, at this very moment while I am speaking to you some ravishing woman is being burned alive,—did that make you care less for your cup of coffee this morning at breakfast?Not a day passes in Paris that some mother in rags does not cast her infant on the world to be picked up by whoever finds it; and yet see! here is this delicious tea in a cup that cost five louis, and I write verses which Parisian women rush to buy, exclaiming, ‘Divine! delicious! charming! food for the soul!’Social nature, like Nature herself, is a great forgetter.You will be quite surprised ten years hence at what you have done today.You are here in a city where people die, where they marry, where they adore each other at an assignation, where young girls suffocate themselves, where the man of genius with his cargo of thoughts teeming with humane beneficence goes to the bottom,—all side by side, sometimes under the same roof, and yet ignorant of each other, ignorant and indifferent.And here you come among us and ask us to expire with grief at this commonplace affair.”"
"“您自称是个诗人！”迪迈喊道，“难道您感受不到您所写的东西？”","“You call yourself a poet!” cried Dumay, “but don’t you feel what you write?”"
"“天哪！如果我们对自己所吟颂的快乐或悲伤感同身受的话，我们不出三个月就要像一双破靴子一样精疲力尽了。”诗人笑着说，“不过，等等，您从勒阿弗尔来到巴黎找卡那利，不能空手而归啊。勇士！”（卡那利摆出荷马史诗中英雄的形体和动作）“请您从诗人这里学学这个道理吧：一个人身上的每一种高贵情感都是一首诗，它是专属于个人的，以至于他最亲密的朋友，他的另一个自我，对此都毫不在乎。那是一笔只属于他自己的财富，那是——”","“Good heavens! if we endured the joys or the woes we sing we should be as worn out in three months as a pair of old boots,” said the poet, smiling.“But stay, you shall not come from Havre to Paris to see Canalis without carrying something back with you.Warrior!” (Canalis had the form and action of an Homeric hero) “learn this from the poet:Every noble sentiment in man is a poem so exclusively individual that his nearest friend, his other self, cares nothing for it.It is a treasure which is his alone, it is—”"
"“请原谅我打断您，”迪迈憎恶地凝视着诗人说，“您去过勒阿弗尔吗？”","“Forgive me for interrupting you,” said Dumay, who was gazing at the poet with horror, “but did you ever come to Havre?”"
"“一八二四年的春天，在去伦敦的路上，我在那儿呆过一天一夜。”","“I was there for a day and a night in the spring of 1824 on my way to London.”"
"“您是个讲信义的人，”迪迈接着说，“您能向我保证您不认识莫黛斯特·米尼翁小姐吗？”","“You are a man of honor,” continued Dumay; “will you give me your word that you do not know Mademoiselle Modeste Mignon?”"
"“这是我第一次听到这个名字。”卡那利答道。","“This is the first time that name ever struck my ear,” replied Canalis."
"“啊，先生！”迪迈说，“我这是陷进了怎样的鬼圈套里啊？我能请求您协助我调查吗？——因为我确定有人盗用了您的名字。您昨天应该收到了一封勒阿弗尔寄来的信。”","“Ah, monsieur!” said Dumay, “into what dark intrigue am I about to plunge?Can I count upon you to help me in my inquiries?—for I am certain that some one has been using your name.You ought to have had a letter yesterday from Havre.”"
"“我什么也没收到啊。不过先生，”卡那利说，“只要有机会帮上忙，我一定帮。”","“I received none.Be sure, monsieur, that I will help you,” said Canalis, “so far as I have the opportunity of doing so.”"
"迪迈告辞了，内心焦灼万分，他以为是那该死的比查冒充诗人欺骗莫黛斯特。而与此同时，比查则正在四处打探卡那利的生活和行为，他像一个想要复仇的王子那样机智敏锐，而且比任何花钱请来的间谍还要聪明，由于不引人注目，所以能像一只钻进树液里的小虫那样避开人们的注意。","Dumay withdrew, his heart torn with anxiety, believing that the wretched Butscha had worn the skin of the poet to deceive Modeste; whereas Butscha himself, keen-witted as a prince seeking revenge, and far cleverer than any paid spy, was ferretting out the life and actions of Canalis, escaping notice by his insignificance, like an insect that bores its way into the sap of a tree."
"布列塔尼人刚刚离开诗人的家，拉布里埃就走进了他朋友的书房里。很自然地，卡那利告诉了他那个勒阿弗尔人的来访。","The Breton had scarcely left the poet’s house when La Briere entered his friend’s study.Naturally, Canalis told him of the visit of the man from Havre."
"“哈！”埃内斯特说，“莫黛斯特·米尼翁，我来正是为了跟你说这个。”","“Ha!” said Ernest, “Modeste Mignon; that is just what I have come to speak of.”"
"“啊，呸！”卡那利叫道，“让你代理，我赢了吗？”","“Ah, bah!” cried Canalis; “have I had a triumph by proxy?”"
"“赢了，而且现在正是关键时刻。我的朋友，世上最甜美的女孩爱上我了——她漂亮得就是站在巴黎最好看的美人儿旁边，也光彩夺目，她的心灵和思想崇高得就像克拉丽莎。她见过我了，我也合她心意，她认为我就是伟大的卡那利。但还不止这些。莫黛斯特·米尼翁出身高贵，蒙日诺刚刚告诉我，她父亲德拉巴斯蒂伯爵好像有六百万财产。她父亲现在就在巴黎，我已经通过蒙日诺，请求两点钟和他见个面。蒙日诺会暗示他，就一句话，说这关系到他女儿的幸福。但在见她父亲之前，我觉得应该把事情一清二楚地告诉你，你懂吧。”","“Yes; and here is the key to it.My friend, I am loved by the sweetest girl in all the world,—beautiful enough to shine beside the greatest beauties in Paris, with a heart and mind worthy of Clarissa.She has seen me; I have pleased her, and she thinks me the great Canalis.But that is not all.Modeste Mignon is of high birth, and Mongenod has just told me that her father, the Comte de La Bastie, has something like six millions.The father is here now, and I have asked him through Mongenod for an interview at two o’clock.Mongenod is to give him a hint, just a word, that it concerns the happiness of his daughter.But you will readily understand that before seeing the father I feel I ought to make a clean breast of it to you.”"
"“在那些靠名声的阳光而开花的植物当中，”卡那利动情地说，“有一株，而且是最华丽的一株，像橘树一样结着金黄的果子，那果子混合着美貌和才智的芳香，一株美丽动人的小树，一种真正的柔情，一份完美的幸福，然而——它竟然从我身边溜走了。”卡那利看着地毯，不让埃内斯特从他眼中读出他的心思。“我能不能，”他停顿了一下，冷静下来，接着说，“我怎样才能从一张漂亮的香纸猜测出那朵花、那颗真心，猜出那位以奉承话表达爱情的少女或少妇，是因为我们自己而爱上我们，而且能给我们幸福呢？那得一位天使或者一个恶魔，才能看透她，但我只是一个野心勃勃的行政法院主席啊！啊，我的朋友，声望使得我们成为了众矢之的。我们有一个同行，就因为写了一首与水有关的诗，就结了一门有钱的婚事，而我比他更有魅力，更讨女人喜欢，却错失了我自己的这门好亲事——因为，你爱她吗，那个可怜的女孩？”他抬起头看着拉布里埃说。","“Among the plants whose flowers bloom in the sunshine of fame,” said Canalis, impressively, “there is one, and the most magnificent, which bears like the orange-tree a golden fruit amid the mingled perfumes of beauty and of mind; a lovely plant, a true tenderness, a perfect bliss, and—it eludes me.”Canalis looked at the carpet that Ernest might not read his eyes.“Could I,” he continued after a pause to regain his self-possession, “how could I have divined that flower from a pretty sheet of perfumed paper, that true heart, that young girl, that woman in whom love wears the livery of flattery, who loves us for ourselves, who offers us felicity?It needed but an angel or a demon to perceive her; and what am I but the ambitious head of a Court of Claims!Ah, my friend, fame makes us the target of a thousand arrows.One of us owes his rich marriage to an hydraulic piece of poetry, while I, more seductive, more a woman’s man than he, have missed mine,—for, do you love her, poor girl?” he said, looking up at La Briere."
"“唉！当然！”这个年轻人喊道。","“Oh!” ejaculated the young man."
"“那好吧，”诗人抓住他秘书的手臂，紧紧地靠在上面，说，“祝你幸福，埃内斯特。出于机缘巧合，我对你还没有忘恩负义。因为你的忠心，你得到了重重的报酬，而我会慷慨地让你的幸福更进一步。”","“Well then,” said the poet, taking his secretary’s arm and leaning heavily upon it, “be happy, Ernest.By a mere accident I have been not ungrateful to you.You are richly rewarded for your devotion, and I will generously further your happiness.”"
"卡那利很气愤，但他只能表现得大方些，而他也打算将这事当作垫脚石，充分利用他的失望去捞一把。","Canalis was furious; but he could not behave otherwise than with propriety, and he made the best of his disappointment by mounting it as a pedestal."
"“啊，卡那利，直到此刻，我才真正了解了你。”","“Ah, Canalis, I have never really known you till this moment.”"
"“你原来想过吗？周游世界是要花一些时间的。”诗人用他那夸张的讽刺回答道。","“Did you expect to?It takes some time to go round the world,” replied the poet with his pompous irony."
"“但是，”拉布里埃说，“想想这一大笔财富吧。”","“But think,” said La Briere, “of this enormous fortune.”"
"“啊，我的朋友，把它投资在你身上不是很好吗？”卡那利大声说着，同时还做了一个充满魅力的手势。","“Ah, my friend, is it not well invested in you?” cried Canalis, accompanying the words with a charming gesture."
"“梅尔基奥尔，”拉布里埃说，“我是生是死全看你了。”","“Melchior,” said La Briere, “I am yours for life and death.”"
"他紧握诗人的手，然后马上离开了，因为他急着去见米尼翁先生。","He wrung the poet’s hand and left him abruptly, for he was in haste to meet Monsieur Mignon."
"第十五章 父亲的介入","Chapter XV A Father Steps In"
"德拉巴斯蒂伯爵此刻正沉浸在悲痛之中，这些悲痛一直等着他来当猎物。从她女儿的信中，他得知贝蒂娜已经过世，妻子也失明了，而且迪迈见到他后，又告诉了他莫黛斯特那极其复杂的恋情。","The Comte de La Bastie was at this moment overwhelmed with the sorrows which lay in wait for him as their prey.He had learned from his daughter’s letter of Bettina’s death and of his wife’s infirmity, and Dumay related to him, when they met, his terrible perplexity as to Modeste’s love affairs."
"“让我一个人呆会儿吧。”他对自己忠诚的朋友说。","“Leave me to myself,” he said to his faithful friend."
"中尉关上门后，这位伤心的父亲瘫坐在沙发上，掩面而泣。这个六十岁的男人眼泪流得很慢，也很少，泪水溢满眼眶，却没有掉下来——眼泪很快干了，又马上开始流——这是人生暮年的最后几滴露水。","As the lieutenant closed the door, the unhappy father threw himself on a sofa, with his head in his hands, weeping those slow, scanty tears which suffuse the eyes of a man of sixty, but do not fall,—tears soon dried, yet quick to start again,—the last dews of the human autumn."
"“有了孩子，有了妻子，去爱护她们——难道这仅仅意味着有了很多颗心、并把它们暴露在匕首面前？”他喊道，随即猛虎一跃般地跳起来，在房间里踱来踱去，“作父亲，就等于放弃自我，绑住手脚，听任悲痛摆布。要是我碰到那个德埃斯图尼，非杀了他不可。叫你生女儿吧！——一个被恶棍骗去了生命，另一个，我的莫黛斯特，又成了谁的牺牲品呢？一个懦夫，用诗人的镀金纸欺骗了她。如果是卡那利本人，那还没这么糟糕，但那个跟司卡班一样狡猾的情人！——我要用双手掐死他。”他大叫道，愤怒中不自觉地做了一个动作，以表明自己的决心。“可然后呢？如果我的莫黛斯特伤心而死怎么办？”","“To have children, to have a wife, to adore them—what is it but to have many hearts and bare them to a dagger?” he cried, springing up with the bound of a tiger and walking up and down the room.“To be a father is to give one’s self over, bound hand and foot to sorrow.If I meet that D’Estourny I will kill him.To have daughters!—one gives her life to a scoundrel, the other, my Modeste, falls a victim to whom? a coward, who deceives her with the gilded paper of a poet.If it were Canalis himself it might not be so bad; but that Scapin of a lover!—I will strangle him with my two hands,” he cried, making an involuntary gesture of furious determination.“And what then? suppose my Modeste were to die of grief?”"
"他呆呆地望着王子饭店的窗外，然后又回到沙发上，一动不动地坐在那里。六次出海印度的疲劳，做投机买卖带来的焦虑，在各种危险面前九死一生，再加上许多伤痛，这一切已让夏尔·米尼翁满头银发。他那轮廓分明的英俊的军人脸庞，如今已被中国和南部海域的烈日晒成了古铜色，有了一种威严的风度，而此刻的悲伤，又让这张脸显得近乎庄严。","He gazed mechanically out of the windows of the hotel des Princes, and then returned to the sofa, where he sat motionless.The fatigues of six voyages to India, the anxieties of speculation, the dangers he had encountered and evaded, and his many griefs, had silvered Charles Mignon’s head.His handsome soldierly face, so pure in outline and now bronzed by the suns of China and the southern seas, had acquired an air of dignity which his present grief rendered almost sublime."
"“蒙日诺告诉我，他对那个要来向我提亲的年轻人十分放心。”最后，他这样想到。就在此时，过去四年中拉巴斯蒂先生一直带在身边的仆人之一通报说，埃内斯特·德拉布里埃来了。","“Mongenod told me he felt confidence in the young man who is coming to ask me for my daughter,” he thought at last; and at this moment Ernest de La Briere was announced by one of the servants whom Monsieur de La Bastie had attached to himself during the last four years."
"“先生，您是从我的朋友蒙日诺那儿来的？”他说。","“You have come, monsieur, from my friend Mongenod?” he said."
"“是的，”埃内斯特答道。当他看到面前这张奥赛罗一般阴沉的面孔时，变得有点胆怯了。“我叫埃内斯特·德拉布里埃，是上一届内阁大臣的亲戚，也是他在任期间的私人秘书。大人被免职时，把我安排到了行政法院，在那儿做法律顾问，以后还有可能继任首席——”","“Yes,” replied Ernest, growing timid when he saw before him a face as sombre as Othello’s.“My name is Ernest de La Briere, related to the family of the late cabinet minister, and his private secretary during his term of office.On his dismissal, his Excellency put me in the Court of Claims, to which I am legal counsel, and where I may possibly succeed as chief—”"
"“但这一切跟德拉巴斯蒂小姐有什么关系呢？”伯爵问道。","“And how does all this concern Mademoiselle de La Bastie?” asked the count."
"“先生，我爱她，而且，我没想到有这福气，她竟然也爱着我。请听我说，先生，”埃内斯特发现这位生气的父亲做了一个暴怒的手势，赶紧说道，“我要向您做一次最为奇特的忏悔，对于一个重视荣誉的人来说，这是一件可耻的事情。我的行为自然要受到惩罚，但最坏的惩罚还不是告诉您这件事。不，我对女儿的害怕甚于对父亲的害怕。”","“Monsieur, I love her; and I have the unhoped-for happiness of being loved by her.Hear me, monsieur,” cried Ernest, checking a violent movement on the part of the angry father.“I have the strangest confession to make to you, a shameful one for a man of honor; but the worst punishment of my conduct, natural enough in itself, is not the telling of it to you; no, I fear the daughter even more than the father.”"
"然后，埃内斯特带着真诚的高贵之心，简单地讲述了他这出小剧的一切情况，没有省掉他带在身上的那二十多封信，也没有省掉他刚刚同卡那利的面谈。米尼翁先生读完这些信的时候，这不幸的情人面色苍白，一脸哀求，在那位普罗旺斯人狂怒的目光下浑身颤抖。","Ernest then related simply, and with the nobleness that comes of sincerity, all the facts of his little drama, not omitting the twenty or more letters, which he had brought with him, nor the interview which he had just had with Canalis.When Monsieur Mignon had finished reading the letters, the unfortunate lover, pale and suppliant, actually trembled under the fiery glance of the Provencal."
"“先生，”普罗旺斯人说，“在整件事情当中，只有一个错误，但那是至关重要的。我的女儿不会拥有六百万财产，她最多只能有二十万法郎的嫁妆，加上很没指望的遗产。”","“Monsieur,” said the latter, “in this whole matter there is but one error, but that is cardinal.My daughter will not have six millions; at the utmost, she will have a marriage portion of two hundred thousand francs, and very doubtful expectations.”"
"“啊，先生！”埃内斯特站起来抓住米尼翁先生的手，大声说，“您真是拿掉了我心上的一块大石头。现在没有什么可以阻碍我的幸福了。我有朋友，有影响力，我一定会当上行政法院院长的。就算米尼翁小姐只有不到一万法郎的财产，就算要我倒贴她嫁妆，她也还是我的妻子。我会让她幸福，就像先生您让您的夫人幸福一样，我还要做您真正的儿子，因为我父亲已经去世了，这是我内心最强烈的愿望。”","“Ah, monsieur!” cried Ernest, rising and grasping Monsieur Mignon’s hand; “you take a load from my breast.Nothing can now hinder my happiness.I have friends, influence; I shall certainly be chief of the Court of Claims.Had Mademoiselle Mignon no more than ten thousand francs, if I had even to make a settlement on her, she should still be my wife; and to make her happy as you, monsieur, have made your wife happy, to be to you a real son (for I have no father), are the deepest desires of my heart.”"
"夏尔·米尼翁向后退了三步，紧紧地盯着拉布里埃的双眼，那目光就像匕首入鞘一般犀利。他默默地站了一会儿，感觉到了这个年轻人毫无遮掩、炯炯有神的目光中流露出十足的坦率和绝对的真诚。“命运终于厌倦了追赶我吗？”他问自己，“这个年轻人会是个好女婿吗？”他焦虑不安地在房间里踱来踱去。","Charles Mignon stepped back three paces and fixed upon La Briere a look which entered the eyes of the young man as a dagger enters its sheath; he stood silent a moment, recognizing the absolute candor, the pure truthfulness of that open nature in the light of the young man’s inspired eyes.“Is fate at last weary of pursuing me?” he asked himself.“Am I to find in this young man the pearl of sons-inlaw?”He walked up and down the room in strong agitation."
"“先生，”他最后说道，“您来这里，就是要寻求判决，那您就必须完全服从判决，要不然，您就是胡闹了。”","“Monsieur,” he said at last, “you are bound to submit wholly to the judgment which you have come here to seek, otherwise you are now playing a farce.”"
"“噢，先生！”","“Oh, monsieur!”"
"“请听我说，”这位父亲说，同时看了拉布里埃一眼，那眼光让他动弹不得，“我既不会严厉无情，也不会不通情理，或是不公正。您假借别人的身份，那您就既要享受这一身份的优势，又要承担这一身份的劣势。我女儿认为她爱上的是当今的一位伟大诗人，而他的名气才是真正吸引她的地方。他的名声就是她的灯塔，而命运的嘲弄却把她抛进了这可怜的现实。好吧，作为她的父亲，我准备给她机会，让她在名声和现实之间做选择。难道她不应该在卡那利和您之间做选择吗？我刚刚跟您所说的我的经营情况，我希望您以荣誉担保，不要告诉他人。你们两个，我是说您和您的朋友德卡那利男爵，可以到勒阿弗尔来度过十月份的下半月。我的家门会向你们二位敞开，而我的女儿需要有机会去深入了解你们。您必须亲自带来您的竞争对手，至于他听到的有关德拉巴斯蒂伯爵的财产的荒唐谣言，请您不要予以纠正，随他去好了。我明天就回勒阿弗尔去，希望三天之后就能见到你们。再见了，先生。”","“Listen to me,” said the father, nailing La Briere where he stood with a glance.“I shall be neither harsh, nor hard, nor unjust.You shall have the advantages and the disadvantages of the false position in which you have placed yourself.My daughter believes that she loves one of the great poets of the day, whose fame is really that which has attracted her.Well, I, her father, intend to give her the opportunity to choose between the celebrity which has been a beacon to her, and the poor reality which the irony of fate has flung at her feet.Ought she not to choose between Canalis and yourself?I rely upon your honor not to repeat what I have told you as to the state of my affairs.You may each come, I mean you and your friend the Baron de Canalis, to Havre for the last two weeks of October.My house will be open to both of you, and my daughter must have an opportunity to study you.You must yourself bring your rival, and not disabuse him as to the foolish tales he will hear about the wealth of the Comte de La Bastie.I go to Havre tomorrow, and I shall expect you three days later.Adieu, monsieur.”"
"可怜的拉布里埃拖着沉重的脚步回到了卡那利家里。此刻，诗人一个人呆在家中，在德塔列朗先生大肆宣扬的第二种冲动的驱使下，任由自己思绪翻涌。第一种冲动是自然的声音，第二种是社会的声音。","Poor La Briere went back to Canalis with a dragging step.The poet, meantime, left to himself, had given way to a current of thought out of which had come that secondary impulse which Monsieur de Talleyrand valued so much.The first impulse is the voice of nature, the second that of society."
"“一个身价六百万的女孩，”他暗自思忖，“而我的双眼竟没能看见那黑暗中闪闪发光的金子！有了这样一笔财富，我就可能当上法国贵族议员、伯爵、侯爵、大使了。以前那些中产阶级女人、愚蠢的女人、狡猾的女人，想要我的手迹，我都给她们回信了，可就在上帝给我送来身价如此之高的金翅膀的天使这一刻，我却厌倦了这些假面舞会的鬼把戏！呸！我要就此作首诗，也许，机会会再次光临我。天哪！那个小拉布里埃倒走运了——借着我的名气招摇撞骗——这是剽窃！我是模型，而他倒要成为塑像了，是这样吗？这真应了贝特朗和拉顿的古老寓言。六百万，一位美女，一位米尼翁·德拉巴斯蒂家的小姐，一位热爱诗歌和诗人的贵族天使！而我，在身体力量首屈一指的人、那位善良的老兵、这位少女的朋友面前，以精神的力量展示了一个上流社会男人的魄力，并做了一番阿尔喀德斯式的演习，让他目瞪口呆。他现在要去告诉这位少女我是一个铁石心肠的人！——本该扮演天使的时候，我却扮演了拿破仑！天哪！是的，我会得到朋友。友情是美好的东西。我已经交上他这个朋友了，但这让我付出了多大的代价啊！六百万，那就是友情的代价，用这种价钱交朋友，可不能多交。”","“A girl worth six millions,” he thought to himself, “and my eyes were not able to see that gold shining in the darkness!With such a fortune I could be peer of France, count, marquis, ambassador.I’ve replied to middle-class women and silly women, and crafty creatures who wanted autographs; I’ve tired myself to death with masked-ball intrigues,—at the very moment when God was sending me a soul of price, an angel with golden wings!Bah! I’ll make a poem on it, and perhaps the chance will come again.Heavens! the luck of that little La Briere,—strutting about in my lustre—plagiarism!I’m the cast and he’s to be the statue, is he?It is the old fable of Bertrand and Raton.Six millions, a beauty, a Mignon de La Bastie, an aristocratic divinity loving poetry and the poet!And I, who showed my muscle as man of the world, who did those Alcide exercises to silence by moral force the champion of physical force, that old soldier with a heart, that friend of this very young girl, whom he’ll now go and tell that I have a heart of iron!—I, to play Napoleon when I ought to have been seraphic!Good heavens!True, I shall have my friend.Friendship is a beautiful thing.I have kept him, but at what a price!Six millions, that’s the cost of it; we can’t have many friends if we pay all that for them.”"
"卡那利正想到这里，拉布里埃走进了他的房间。他一脸沮丧的样子。","La Briere entered the room as Canalis reached this point in his meditations.He was gloom personified."
"“喂，怎么了？”卡那利说。","“Well, what’s the matter?” said Canalis."
"“那位父亲要求让他女儿在两个卡那利之间做选择——”","“The father exacts that his daughter shall choose between the two Canalis—”"
"“可怜的孩子！”诗人笑着叫道，“那位父亲真是个聪明的家伙。”","“Poor boy!” cried the poet, laughing, “he’s a clever fellow, that father.”"
"“我已经用荣誉担保，我会带你去勒阿弗尔。”拉布里埃可怜兮兮地说。","“I have pledged my honor that I will take you to Havre,” said La Briere, piteously."
"“我的朋友，”卡那利说，“如果事关你的荣誉，那你放心吧，我一定去。我会去请一个月的假。”","“My dear fellow,” said Canalis, “if it is a question of your honor you may count on me.I’ll ask for leave of absence for a month.”"
"“莫黛斯特真是太漂亮了！”拉布里埃用绝望的口吻惊呼道，“你会把我挤没影的。一路上，我都在想命运怎么会对我这么好，我知道这一切肯定是搞错了。”","“Modeste is so beautiful!” exclaimed La Briere, in a despairing tone.“You will crush me out of sight.I wondered all along that fate should be so kind to me; I knew it was all a mistake.”"
"“呸！那就走着瞧吧。”卡那利欣喜若狂地说。","“Bah! we will see about that,” said Canalis with inhuman gaiety."
"当天晚上吃过晚饭后，夏尔·米尼翁和迪迈付给每个左马驭者三法郎，从巴黎飞奔回勒阿弗尔。关于莫黛斯特以及她的恋情，这位父亲已经让他忠心耿耿的管家的思想平静下来了。警戒解除了，而比查也清白了。","That evening, after dinner, Charles Mignon and Dumay, were flying, by virtue of three francs to each postilion, from Paris to Havre.The father had eased the watch-dog’s mind as to Modeste and her love affairs; the guard was relieved, and Butscha’s innocence established."
"“一切都很顺利，我的老迪迈。”伯爵说。他已经向蒙日诺打听了卡那利和拉布里埃的有关情况。“我们就要有两位演员来扮演一个角色了！”他高兴地大声说道。","“It is all for the best, my old Dumay,” said the count, who had been making certain inquiries of Mongenod respecting Canalis and La Briere.“We are going to have two actors for one part!” he cried gaily."
"尽管如此，他还是让他的老战友对即将在木屋上演的喜剧绝对保密——这可能是出喜剧，但同时也是父亲对女儿的一个小小惩罚，或者教训——如果你更喜欢这种说法。","Nevertheless, he requested his old comrade to be absolutely silent about the comedy which was now to be played at the Chalet,—a comedy it might be, but also a gentle punishment, or, if you prefer it, a lesson given by the father to the daughter."
"两位朋友一路从巴黎长谈到勒阿弗尔，这让中校了解了过去四年里他家的情况。他还告诉迪迈，著名的外科专家德普兰这个月底会到勒阿弗尔来检查米尼翁夫人的白内障，看看有没有可能让她重见光明。","The two friends kept up a long conversation all the way from Paris to Havre, which put the colonel in possession of the facts relating to his family during the past four years, and informing Dumay that Desplein, the great surgeon, was coming to Havre at the end of the present month to examine the cataract on Madame Mignon’s eyes, and decide if it were possible to restore her sight."
"木屋的人正准备吃早餐，这时，车夫噼啪作响的长鞭声告诉一家人两位军人回来了。也只有父亲久别归家的欢乐，才能带来如此热闹，并让所有的女人都跑到花园门口迎接。多少父亲，多少子女，都能理解这归来的喜悦——或许父亲比子女理解得更深刻，而那种幸福的场景，文学作品是无需加以描述的。也许，所有温柔细腻的情感都是文学无法表达的吧。","A few moments before the breakfast-hour at the Chalet, the clacking of a postilion’s whip apprised the family that the two soldiers were arriving; only a father’s joy at returning after long absence could be heralded with such clatter, and it brought all the women to the garden gate.There is many a father and many a child—perhaps more fathers than children—who will understand the delights of such an arrival, and that happy fact shows that literature has no need to depict it.Perhaps all gentle and tender emotions are beyond the range of literature."
"在欢乐的日子里，没有谁会去说破坏家庭和睦的话。莫黛斯特那所谓的神秘恋情让她脸色苍白——因为这是迪迈去巴黎后她第一次下床。在神秘恋情这个问题上，父亲、母亲和孩子心照不宣地休战了。中校拥有一名真正的军人那令人赞叹的细腻情感，他一步都没有离开过妻子身边，也一刻都没有松开过她的手。他高兴地看着莫黛斯特，不厌其烦地观察者她那高雅的举止，以及端庄高贵、富有诗意的美貌。不正是从这些小事上，才能看出一个男人情感丰富吗？莫黛斯特生怕打扰了这对夫妻那不可多得的欢乐，便站在稍远处，时不时地过来亲吻她父亲的额头。她亲吻的次数多了，就好像是在代表两个人亲吻他——贝蒂娜和她自己。","Not a word that could trouble the peace of the family was uttered on this joyful day.Truce was tacitly established between father, mother, and child as to the so-called mysterious love which had paled Modeste’s cheeks,—for this was the first day she had left her bed since Dumay’s departure for Paris.The colonel, with the charming delicacy of a true soldier, never left his wife’s side nor released her hand; but he watched Modeste with delight, and was never weary of noting her refined, elegant, and poetic beauty.Is it not by such seeming trifles that we recognize a man of feeling?Modeste, who feared to interrupt the subdued joy of the husband and wife kept at a little distance, coming from time to time to kiss her father’s forehead, and when she kissed it overmuch she seemed to mean that she was kissing it for two,—for Bettina and herself."
"“唉，我的宝贝，我明白你的意思。”莫黛斯特热烈地亲吻中校时，他抓住她的手说道。","“Oh, my darling, I understand you,” said the colonel, pressing her hand as she assailed him with kisses."
"“嘘！”这位少女看着她的母亲，轻声说道。","“Hush!” whispered the young girl, glancing at her mother."
"迪迈故意意味深长地保持着沉默，这让莫黛斯特对他巴黎之行的结果感到有些不安。她时不时偷偷地看看他，但没能看出他的心思。中校像一位小心谨慎的父亲那样，在召开一个决定整个家庭幸福的会议之前，想先了解一下他唯一的女儿的性格，还有，最重要的是，跟他夫人商量一下。","Dumay’s rather sly and pregnant silence made Modeste somewhat uneasy as to the upshot of his journey to Paris.She looked at him furtively every now and then, without being able to get beneath his epidermis.The colonel, like a prudent father, wanted to study the character of his only daughter, and above all consult his wife, before entering on a conference upon which the happiness of the whole family depended."
"“明天，我的宝贝，”晚上各自就寝时他说，“你起早一点儿，我们到海边去散散步。我们得谈谈你的诗作，德拉巴斯蒂小姐。”","“Tomorrow, my precious child,” he said as they parted for the night, “get up early, and we will go and take a walk on the seashore.We have to talk about your poems, Mademoiselle de La Bastie.”"
"他的最后几句话是笑着说的，那微笑像是回声一样重现在迪迈嘴唇上。对于将要发生的事情，莫黛斯特得到的提示也就这么多了，但这足以让她的不安平静下来，也让她直到深夜仍无法入睡，满脑子都是各种假设。不过，这并没妨碍她第二天早晨早早地赶在中校之前梳妆打扮，准备妥当。","His last words, accompanied by a smile, which reappeared like an echo on Dumay’s lips, were all that gave Modeste any clew to what was coming; but it was enough to calm her uneasiness and keep her awake far into the night with her head full of suppositions; this, however, did not prevent her from being dressed and ready in the morning long before the colonel."
"“你都知道了，我的好爸爸？”他们一走上去海边的路，她就问道。","“You know all, my kind papa?” she said as soon as they were on the road to the beach."
"“我都知道了，而且比你知道的还要多很多。”他回答说。","“I know all, and a good deal more than you do,” he replied."
"说完那句话，父女俩默不作声地走了一小段路。","After that remark father and daughter went some little way in silence."
"“孩子，跟我解释解释，一个被母亲极端宠爱的女孩子，怎么会在没征求母亲意见的情况下，就迈出了这么重要的一步——给一个陌生人写信呢？”","“Explain to me, my child, how it happens that a girl whom her mother idolizes could have taken such an important step as to write to a stranger without consulting her.”"
"“哎呀，爸爸！因为妈妈永远都不会允许我那样做的。”","“Oh, papa! because mamma would never have allowed it.”"
"“那么，我的女儿，你认为那样做合理吗？虽然说这个致命危险的做法是你自己想出来的，但是，就算没有廉耻之心，你的理性和才智怎么没有告诉你，这样做就等于向男人主动投怀送抱呢？想想我的女儿，我剩下的唯一的孩子，就这么缺乏自尊和矜持吗！唉，莫黛斯特，你让你父亲在听到这件事之后，度过了地狱般的两个小时，因为不管怎样，你的行为跟贝蒂娜是一样的，而且没有别人的引诱作为借口。你是一个卖弄风情的冷血女子，而且，这种头脑发热的卖弄风情，是法国女人最不道德的行为。”","“And do you think, my daughter, that that was proper?Though you have been educating your mind in this fatal way, how is it that your good sense and your intellect did not, in default of modesty, step in and show you that by acting as you did you were throwing yourself at a man’s head.To think that my daughter, my only remaining child, should lack pride and delicacy!Oh, Modeste, you made your father pass two hours in hell when he heard of it; for, after all, your conduct has been the same as Bettina’s without the excuse of a heart’s seduction; you were a coquette in cold blood, and that sort of coquetry is head-love, the worst vice of French women.”"
"“我没有自尊！”莫黛斯特哭着说，“可他都还没见过我呢。”","“I, without pride!” said Modeste, weeping; “but he has not yet seen me.”"
"“他知道你的名字。”","“He knows your name.”"
"“我是直到亲眼证实了信中所说的情况，才告诉他我的名字的。我们写了三个月的信，那期间，我们的心灵进行了交流。”","“I did not tell it to him till my eyes had vindicated the correspondence, lasting three months, during which our souls had spoken to each other.”"
"“唉，我亲爱的迷途天使，你是把某种理智的东西同荒唐之举混淆在一起了，而这荒唐之举危害到了你和家人的幸福。”","“Oh, my dear misguided angel, you have mixed up a species of reason with a folly that has compromised your own happiness and that of your family.”"
"“可是爸爸，毕竟幸福是对我鲁莽之举的补偿嘛。”她撅着嘴说。","“But, after all, papa, happiness is the absolution of my temerity,” she said, pouting."
"“噢！你的行为是鲁莽的，对吗？”","“Oh! your conduct is temerity, is it?”"
"“一种我母亲以前也有过的鲁莽。”她很快反驳道。","“A temerity that my mother practised before me,” she retorted quickly."
"“真是个倔强的孩子！你的母亲在一次舞会上看到我之后，就告诉很爱她的爸爸，她认为跟我在一起会幸福。老实说吧，莫黛斯特，我承认我跟你母亲的爱情来得很快，但毕竟还是在她父亲的眼皮底下进行的，这与你写信给一个陌生人的疯狂之举有任何相似之处吗？”","“Rebellious child! your mother after seeing me at a ball told her father, who adored her, that she thought she could be happy with me.Be honest, Modeste; is there any likeness between a love hastily conceived, I admit, but under the eyes of a father, and your mad action of writing to a stranger?”"
"“陌生人，爸爸？你应该说他是我们最伟大的诗人之一，他的品格和生活都暴露在众目睽睽之下，任人诽谤和中伤——他是一个享有盛誉的人，对他而言，我亲爱的父亲，我只是一个文学作品和戏剧里的人物，一个莎士比亚笔下的女子，直到我决定看看他本人是否也跟他的心灵一样美好。”","“A stranger, papa? say rather one of our greatest poets, whose character and whose life are exposed to the strongest light of day, to detraction, to calumny,—a man robed in fame, and to whom, my dear father, I was a mere literary and dramatic personage, one of Shakespeare’s women, until the moment when I wished to know if the man himself were as beautiful as his soul.”"
"“天哪！我可怜的孩子，你是在把婚姻变成诗歌。但是，自远古以来，女孩子们就一直呆在家里、深居简出，如果上帝和社会准则将她们置于父母的严格约束之下，记住我的话，那是为了让她们免遭这些诗歌给她们带来的不幸。这些诗歌让你迷恋、晕眩，让你无法对其进行判断。诗歌确实是生活的乐趣之一，但却并不是生活本身。”","“Good God! my poor child, you are turning marriage into poetry.But if, from time immemorial, girls have been cloistered in the bosom of their families, if God, if social laws put them under the stern yoke of parental sanction, it is, mark my words, to spare them the misfortunes that this very poetry which charms and dazzles you, and which you are therefore unable to judge of, would entail upon them.Poetry is indeed one of the pleasures of life, but it is not life itself.”"
"“爸爸，在事实的法庭面前，这还是一件悬而未决的案子。心灵与父母之命之间的斗争，会永远继续下去的。”","“Papa, that is a suit still pending before the Court of Facts; the struggle is forever going on between our hearts and the claims of family.”"
"“我真为以反抗家庭为幸福的孩子感到遗憾。”中校严肃地说，“一八一三年，我亲眼看着我的一个战友——德哀格勒蒙侯爵，不顾他父亲的反对，娶了他的表妹。那位少女把固执当作爱情，而这一对新人从那时起，就为他们的固执付出了沉重代价。家庭必须是婚姻的最高统治者。”","“Alas for the child that finds her happiness in resisting them,” said the colonel, gravely.“In 1813 I saw one of my comrades, the Marquis d’Aiglemont, marry his cousin against the wishes of her father, and the pair have since paid dear for the obstinacy which the young girl took for love.The family must be sovereign in marriage.”"
"“这一切我的诗人已经告诉过我了。”她回答说，“有段时间他扮演奥尔恭的角色，而且他还敢于贬低诗人的个人生活。”","“My poet has told me all that,” she answered.“He played Orgon for some time; and he was brave enough to disparage the personal lives of poets.”"
"“我读过你的信了，”夏尔·米尼翁说，嘴角闪过一丝嘲弄的微笑，这让莫黛斯特感觉很不自在，“而且，我得说，你的最后一封信对任何女人，甚至是朱莉·德埃棠芝来说，都几乎是不能被允许的。天哪！小说真是害人不浅啊！”","“I have read your letters,” said Charles Mignon, with the flicker of a malicious smile on his lips that made Modeste very uneasy, “and I ought to remark that your last epistle was scarcely permissible in any woman, even a Julie d’Etanges.Good God! what harm novels do!”"
"“我亲爱的父亲，不管人们写不写小说，我们都在扮演着小说中的角色，我觉得读一读小说会更好。如今已不像路易十四和路易十五那个年代，有那么多探险了，所以小说出版得也少了。另外，如果您读了那些信，您就应该知道，我是选择了最善良、最正直的人做您的女婿，而且您一定看出来了，我们彼此相爱，至少是像您跟妈妈那样彼此相爱的。好吧，我承认这种做法并不绝对符合习俗。我做错了——如果您真要我这样说的话——”","“We should live them, my dear father, whether people wrote them or not; I think it is better to read them.There are not so many adventures in these days as there were under Louis XIV. and Louis XV., and so they publish fewer novels.Besides, if you have read those letters, you must know that I have chosen the most angelic soul, the most sternly upright man for your son-inlaw, and you must have seen that we love one another at least as much as you and mamma love each other.Well, I admit that it was not all exactly conventional; I did, if you will have me say so, wrong—”"
"“我读过你的信了，”她父亲打断她，“而且我确切地知道，你的情人怎样在你面前，把一个深谙世事并被激情牵着走的女人可以做、但一个二十岁姑娘做了就是大错特错的事，说得头头是道。”","“I have read your letters,” said her father, interrupting her, “and I know exactly how far your lover justified you in your own eyes for a proceeding which might be permissible in some woman who understood life, and who was led away by strong passion, but which in a young girl of twenty was a monstrous piece of wrong-doing.”"
"“是的，对于普通人，对于思想狭隘的哥本海姆式的人，对于那些用角尺来衡量生活的人来说，这当然是过错。请让我们坚持艺术的、诗意的生活吧，爸爸。我们这些少女只有两种行为方式：要么通过矫揉造作和媚笑来让一个男人知道我们爱他，要么坦率地走向他。难道后一种方式不伟大、不高贵么？我们法国女孩子就像商品一样，被我们的家庭在两个月内出售，有时候一个月内就卖出去了，就像维尔坎小姐那样。但是，在英国，在瑞士，在德国，女孩子们都和我采取的方式差不多。那么您对此作何感想呢？难道我不是半个德国人吗？”","“Yes, wrong-doing for commonplace people, for the narrow-minded Gobenheims, who measure life with a square rule.Please let us keep to the artistic and poetic life, papa.We young girls have only two ways to act; we must let a man know we love him by mincing and simpering, or we must go to him frankly.Isn’t the last way grand and noble?We French girls are delivered over by our families like so much merchandise, at sixty days’ sight, sometimes thirty, like Mademoiselle Vilquin; but in England, and Switzerland, and Germany, they follow very much the plan I have adopted.Now what have you got to say to that?Am I not half German?”"
"“孩子！”中校看着她喊道，“法国的至高无上正是来自其明智的判断力，来自她高贵的语言赋予其思想的逻辑能力。法兰西是整个世界的理性所在。英国和德国在婚姻习俗方面属于浪漫派——但即使在那些国家，贵族家庭也遵循我们的习俗。你的父母，他们了解生活，他们要为你的心灵和你的幸福负责，你肯定不想剥夺你父母保护你不受绊脚石的伤害的权利吧？天哪！”他一半对女儿、一半对自己说道，“这是孩子们的错，还是我们的错啊？我们应该将子女置于镣铐枷锁之下吗？我们受慈爱的驱使，心里知道怎么做才能让他们快乐，难道我们要因这种慈爱受到惩罚吗？”","“Child!” cried the colonel, looking at her; “the supremacy of France comes from her sound common-sense, from the logic to which her noble language constrains her mind.France is the reason of the whole world.England and Germany are romantic in their marriage customs,—though even there noble families follow our customs.You certainly do not mean to deny that your parents, who know life, who are responsible for your soul and for your happiness, have no right to guard you from the stumbling-blocks that are in your way?Good heavens!” he continued, speaking half to himself, “is it their fault, or is it ours?Ought we to hold our children under an iron yoke?Must we be punished for the tenderness that leads us to make them happy, and teaches our hearts how to do so?”"
"莫黛斯特一边听父亲用哽咽的声音说出这番近乎祈祷的话，一边用眼角的余光观察着父亲。","Modeste watched her father out of the corner of her eye as she listened to this species of invocation, uttered in a broken voice."
"“一个尚未婚配的姑娘，挑选了一个不仅长相英俊，而且出身高贵的杰出天才，一位跟我这样的淑女相匹配的绅士，来做自己的丈夫，难道有错吗？”她说。","“Was it wrong,” she said, “in a girl whose heart was free, to choose for her husband not only a charming companion, but a man of noble genius, born to an honorable position, a gentleman; the equal of myself, a gentlewoman?”"
"“你爱他吗？”她父亲问道。","“You love him?” asked her father."
"“父亲！”她把头靠在他的怀里，说，“你会眼睁睁看着我死去吗？”","“Father!” she said, laying her head upon his breast, “would you see me die?”"
"“够了！”这位老兵说道，“我看得出，你的爱是不可扑灭的。”","“Enough!” said the old soldier.“I see your love is inextinguishable.”"
"“是的，不可扑灭。”","“Yes, inextinguishable.”"
"“什么都不能改变你的爱了？”","“Can nothing change it?”"
"“什么都不能。”","“Nothing.”"
"“任何变故、任何欺骗、任何背叛都不能？你是说，就因为他的外在魅力，你就会不顾一切地爱他？就算他是个德埃斯图尼式的人，你也爱他？”","“No circumstances, no treachery, no betrayal?You mean that you will love him in spite of everything, because of his personal attractions?Even though he proved a D’Estourny, would you love him still?”"
"“哎呀，父亲！您不了解您的女儿。我会爱上一个懦夫，一个不知廉耻、不讲信义的人吗？”","“Oh, my father! you do not know your daughter.Could I love a coward, a man without honor, without faith?”"
"“但假如他欺骗了你呢？”","“But suppose he had deceived you?”"
"“他？那个诚实、耿直的灵魂，略带忧郁的小伙子？您在开玩笑吧，父亲，要不就是您根本没见过他。”","“He? that honest, candid soul, half melancholy?You are joking, father, or else you have never met him.”"
"“但现在你看出来了吧，你的爱并不是——用你的说法——不可扑灭的。我已经让你承认，变故是可以改变你的诗作的，难道你现在还没看出，父亲在某些方面还是很有用的？”","“But you see now that your love is not inextinguishable, as you chose to call it.I have already made you admit that circumstances could alter your poem; don’t you now see that fathers are good for something?”"
"“您想教训教训我，爸爸，您肯定又想当“儿童之友”了。”","“You want to give me a lecture, papa; it is positively l’Ami des Enfants over again.”"
"“可怜的上了当的姑娘，”她的父亲严肃地说，“不是我要教训你，这与我毫不相干，事实上，我只是想尽量缓和你即将受到的打击。”","“Poor deceived girl,” said her father, sternly; “it is no lecture of mine, I count for nothing in it; indeed, I am only trying to soften the blow.”"
"“父亲，别拿我的生命开玩笑了。”莫黛斯特脸色苍白地惊呼道。","“Father, don’t play tricks with my life,” exclaimed Modeste, turning pale."
"“那么，我的女儿，拿出你的全部勇气来。拿你生命开玩笑的是你自己，现在生活反过来拿你开玩笑了。”","“Then, my daughter, summon all your courage.It is you who have been playing tricks with your life, and life is now tricking you.”"
"莫黛斯特十分惊诧，呆呆地望着她的父亲。","Modeste looked at her father in stupid amazement."
"“如果四天前你在勒阿弗尔教堂看到的那个你爱的年轻人是个骗子呢？”","“Suppose that young man whom you love, whom you saw four days ago at church in Havre, was a deceiver?”"
"“不可能！”她叫道，“那高贵的额头，那富有诗意的苍白脸庞——”","“Never!” she cried; “that noble head, that pale face full of poetry—”"
"“——是骗人的，”中校打断她说道，“他不是卡那利先生，就像我不是出海的船员一样。”","“—was a lie,” said the colonel interrupting her.“He was no more Monsieur de Canalis than I am that sailor over there putting out to sea.”"
"“您知道您这是抹杀了我心里的什么东西吗？”她低声说道。","“Do you know what you are killing in me?” she said in a low voice."
"“放宽心吧，我的孩子，虽然命运已经把对你错误的惩罚变成了错误，但损失并不是不可弥补的。你见到的那个年轻人，那个通过写信和你交心的人，是个诚实且值得尊敬的小伙子，他来找我，并把一切都告诉了我。他爱你，而我也不反对他做我的女婿。”","“Comfort yourself, my child; though accident has put the punishment of your fault into the fault itself, the harm done is not irreparable.The young man whom you have seen, and with whom you exchanged hearts by correspondence, is a loyal and honorable fellow; he came to me and confided everything.He loves you, and I have no objection to him as a son-inlaw.”"
"“如果他不是卡那利，那他是谁？”莫黛斯特问道，声音有所改变。","“If he is not Canalis, who is he then?” said Modeste in a changed voice."
"“是他的秘书，名叫埃内斯特·德拉布里埃。他不是贵族，但他是那些有原则、重道德、让父母满意的普通人中的一个。不过这不是关键，关键的是你已经见过他了，而且没有什么能改变你的心意了。你已经选择了他，了解了他的心灵，他的心灵跟他本人一样美好。”","“The secretary; his name is Ernest de La Briere.He is not a nobleman; but he is one of those plain men with fixed principles and sound morality who satisfy parents.However, that is not the point; you have seen him and nothing can change your heart; you have chosen him, comprehend his soul, it is as beautiful as he himself.”"
"伯爵被莫黛斯特一声沉重的叹息打断了。这个可怜的姑娘坐在那里，双眼盯着大海，像死人一样苍白僵硬。这些致命的话，就像手枪发射出的子弹，打中了她——一个普通人，有原则、重道德的普通人。","The count was interrupted by a heavy sigh from Modeste.The poor girl sat with her eyes fixed on the sea, pale and rigid as death, as if a pistol shot had struck her in those fatal words, a plain man, with fixed principles and sound morality."
"“被骗了！”她最后说道。","“Deceived!” she said at last."
"“跟你可怜的姐姐一样，但没那么严重。”","“Like your poor sister, but less fatally.”"
"“我们回去吧，父亲，”她从两个人坐着的小土墩上站起来说道，“爸爸，听我说，我在上帝面前发誓，在我的婚姻这件事上，不论你的意愿如何，我都会遵从。”","“Let us go home, father,” she said, rising from the hillock on which they were sitting.“Papa, hear me, I swear before God to obey your wishes, whatever they may be, in the affair of my marriage.”"
"“那你不再爱他了？”他的父亲问道。","“Then you don’t love him any longer?” asked her father."
"“我爱诚实的人，不会弄虚作假的人，像您一样正直，不会像演员一样伪装自己，把别人的荣誉画在自己脸上的人。”","“I loved an honest man, with no falsehood on his face, upright as yourself, incapable of disguising himself like an actor, with the paint of another man’s glory on his cheeks.”"
"“你说过，没有什么能改变你的。”中校讽刺地说道。","“You said nothing could change you”; remarked the colonel, ironically."
"“啊，别笑话我了！”她双手紧握，痛苦、焦急地看着她的父亲，大声说道，“您不明白吗？您这是用玩笑来绞我的心、毁灭我的信仰啊？”","“Ah, do not trifle with me!” she exclaimed, clasping her hands and looking at her father in distressful anxiety; “don’t you see that you are wringing my heart and destroying my beliefs with your jokes.”"
"“上帝不会容许我那么做的！我告诉你的是确凿的事实。”","“God forbid! I have told you the exact truth.”"
"“父亲，您真好。”她停顿了一会儿，一本正经地说道。","“You are very kind, father,” she said after a pause, and with a sort of solemnity."
"“你的信他都留着呢，”中校又说道，“现在试想一下，你那些发自内心的轻率情话如果是落到了那种诗人手里呢？据迪迈所说，他们用这些信来点雪茄。”","“He has kept your letters,” resumed the colonel; “now suppose the rash caresses of your soul had fallen into the hands of one of those poets who, as Dumay says, light their cigars with them?”"
"“哎呀！——您说得太离谱了吧。”","“Oh!—you are going too far.”"
"“是卡那利告诉他的。”","“Canalis told him so.”"
"“迪迈见到了卡那利？”","“Has Dumay seen Canalis?”"
"“是的。”她父亲答道。","“Yes,” answered her father."
"两个人静静地走着。","The two walked along in silence."
"“所以，”莫黛斯特又说道，“这就是为什么那位先生告诉我诗人和诗歌有那么多害人之处，难怪那个小秘书说——哎呀，”她打断了自己，补充道，“他信中表现出的美德、高贵品质和细腻情感都只是一种盗窃！盗取荣誉和姓名的人很可能会——”","“So that is why that gentleman,” resumed Modeste, “told me so much harm of poets and poetry; no wonder the little secretary said—Why,” she added, interrupting herself, “his virtues, his noble qualities, his fine sentiments are nothing but an epistolary theft!The man who steals glory and a name may very likely—”"
"“——溜门撬锁、偷人钱财、拦路杀人。”中校大声说道，“啊，你们这些小姑娘，你们就是这样——固执己见，又对生活一无所知。欺骗过女人的男人生来就该上断头台。”","“—break locks, steal purses, and cut people’s throats on the highway,” cried the colonel.“Ah, you young girls, that’s just like you,—with your peremptory opinions and your ignorance of life.A man who once deceives a woman was born under the scaffold on which he ought to die.”"
"这段奚落让莫黛斯特兴高采烈的心情暂时平复了下来，两个人又默不作声了。","This ridicule stopped Modeste’s effervescence for a moment and least, and again there was silence."
"“我的孩子，”没过多久中校又说道，“社会中的男人，就跟大自然中的所有雄性一样，生来就要赢得女性的心，而女人必须要保护自己。你却选择了颠倒角色。那明智吗？任何东西，处在错误的位置上，就是错的。首先做错的是你。不，男人想办法讨女人欢心，但他并不因此而成为一个恶魔。我们有权利不计后果地主动进攻，来赢得女人，不过违法犯罪和懦弱无能除外。纵使男人确实欺骗了女人，他也可能有许多优点。如果他欺骗了她，那是因为他发现对方缺少某些他试图寻求的财富。只有女王、演员，或是一个地位比男人高得多、以至于被男人当作女王的的女人，才能自己走向男人而不招致谴责——但一个少女不能这样做！为什么呢？那是因为不论她犯的错是多么的善意，多么富有诗意，或者多么小心谨慎——她都违背了上帝赋予她的神圣、美好而又高贵的一切。”","“My child,” said the colonel, presently, “men in society, as in nature everywhere, are made to win the hearts of women, and women must defend themselves.You have chosen to invert the parts.Was that wise?Everything is false in a false position.The first wrong-doing was yours.No, a man is not a monster because he seeks to please a woman; it is our right to win her by aggression with all its consequences, short of crime and cowardice.A man may have many virtues even if he does deceive a woman; if he deceives her, it is because he finds her wanting in some of the treasures that he sought in her.None but a queen, an actress, or a woman placed so far above a man that she seems to him a queen, can go to him of herself without incurring blame—and for a young girl to do it!Why, she is false to all that God has given her that is sacred and lovely and noble,—no matter with what grace or what poetry or what precautions she surrounds her fault.”"
"“本想找个主人，却得到了个仆人！”她心酸地说道，“唉！我永远都不能好起来了！”","“To seek the master and find the servant!” she said bitterly, “oh! I can never recover from it!”"
"“胡说！在我看来，埃内斯特·德拉布里埃先生完全比得上德卡那利男爵。他曾做过一位内阁大臣的私人秘书，现在是行政法院的法律顾问，他有良心，而且他爱你，只是——他不写诗。对，我承认，他不是诗人，但尽管如此，他仍可能拥有一颗充满诗意的心。无论如何，我亲爱的姑娘，”看到莫黛斯特做了一个厌恶的手势，她的父亲又补充道，“你要见见他们俩，那个冒牌货和真正的卡那利——”","“Nonsense!Monsieur Ernest de La Briere is, to my thinking, fully the equal of the Baron de Canalis.He was private secretary of a cabinet minister, and he is now counsel for the Court of Claims; he has a heart, and he adores you, but—he does not write verses.No, I admit, he is not a poet; but for all that he may have a heart full of poetry.At any rate, my dear girl,” added her father, as Modeste made a gesture of disgust, “you are to see both of them, the sham and the true Canalis—”"
"“哎呀，爸爸！——”","“Oh, papa!—”"
"“你刚刚不是发誓说要遵从我吗，哪怕是在婚姻这件事上？那么，我允许你从他们两个中间选一个你更喜欢的做你的丈夫。你从一首诗开始，那就要以一首田园诗结尾，试试看在这里，在这相间，你能否从打猎、钓鱼这类短途旅游中，发现两位绅士的真正性格。","“Did you not swear just now to obey me in everything, even in the affair of your marriage?Well, I allow you to choose which of the two you like best for a husband.You have begun by a poem, you shall finish with a bucolic, and try if you can discover the real character of these gentlemen here, in the country, on a few hunting or fishing excursions.”"
"莫黛斯特低着头，跟着父亲走回家。她听着父亲说的话，但只以只言片语作答。","Modeste bowed her head and walked home with her father, listening to what he said but replying only in monosyllables."
"第十六章 如梦初醒","Chapter XVI Disenchanted"
"这个可怜的女孩儿攀上高山去寻找她雄鹰的巢穴，却丢脸地摔到了下面泥泞的沼泽中，用当今一位作家诗意的语言形容，就是“在感受过脚下柔软的鞋底后，就不能再踏上现实的碎玻璃了。”想象力在那脆弱的胸怀里汇集了全部的女子气质，从纯真少女暗藏的紫罗兰色的幻想，到对肉欲的热望——这想象力把她引到了魔法花园，那里，唉，有一番辛酸的景象！现在，她从地上跳起来，看到的不是幻想中无比壮丽的鲜花，而是黑色曼陀罗那毛茸茸的、扭曲缠绕的根茎。”莫黛斯特突然发现，她被人从爱情的神秘高峰拉到了一条笔直平坦、两边都是沟渠的路上——简单地说，就是平常生活中的平常路。怎样充满热情、意气风发的心灵，这样摔一跤后不会伤痕累累、破碎不堪呢？她都把自己的思想撒到了什么人的脚下啊？重新回到木屋的莫黛斯特已不再是两个小时前离开的那个莫黛斯特了，就如同走在街上的女演员不再是舞台上的女演员一样。她陷入了一种麻木的沮丧状态，看起来很可怜。阳光暗了下来，大自然也戴上了面纱，就连花儿也不再跟她说话了。跟所有具有极端倾向的少女一样，她端着幻灭的酒杯，酩酊大醉。她同现实搏斗，不愿把头伸进家庭和习俗的枷锁里，她感觉那枷锁太重、太硬、太压抑了。她不愿倾听父母的安慰，她让自己的心经受最痛苦的折磨，从中尝到了一种残忍的快乐。","The poor girl had fallen humiliated from the alp she had scaled in search of her eagle’s nest, into the mud of the swamp below, where (to use the poetic language of an author of our day) “after feeling the soles of her feet too tender to tread the broken glass of reality,Imagination—which in that delicate bosom united the whole of womanhood, from the violet-hidden reveries of a chaste young girl to the passionate desires of the sex—had led her into enchanted gardens where, oh, bitter sight!she now saw, springing from the ground, not the sublime flower of her fancy, but the hairy, twisted limbs of the black mandragora.”Modeste suddenly found herself brought down from the mystic heights of her love to a straight, flat road bordered with ditches,—in short the work-day path of common life.What ardent, aspiring soul would not have been bruised and broken by such a fall?Whose feet were these at which she had shed her thoughts?The Modeste who re-entered the Chalet was no more the Modeste who had left it two hours earlier than an actress in the street is like an actress on the boards.She fell into a state of numb depression that was pitiful to see.The sun was darkened, nature veiled itself, even the flowers no longer spoke to her.Like all young girls with a tendency to extremes, she drank too deeply of the cup of disillusion.She fought against reality, and would not bend her neck to the yoke of family and conventions; it was, she felt, too heavy, too hard, too crushing.She would not listen to the consolations of her father and mother, and tasted a sort of savage pleasure in letting her soul suffer to the utmost."
"“可怜的比查说对了。”有天晚上她说道。","“Poor Butscha was right,” she said one evening."
"这句话说明了悲伤忧愁的她在短短的时间里，从现实的贫瘠草原上跋涉了多少路程。由过度奢望引起的悲伤是一种疾病——有时这种悲伤是致命的。从生理学上讲，没有什么有效的方法能弄清思想是通过什么途径、以什么方式创造出同毒药一般的内在紊乱，也无法弄清绝望怎样影响食欲、破坏幽门、改变最顽强的生命的所有生理状况。这就是莫黛斯特所处的状况。短短三天里，她就表现出了忧郁的病态模样，她不唱歌，也没有谁能让她微笑。那两位朋友迟迟不来，夏尔·米尼翁有点不安了，便想去接他们。这时，到了第五天晚上，他从拉图奈尔那里得到消息说他们动身了。","The words indicate the distance she travelled in a short space of time and in gloomy sadness across the barren plain of reality.Sadness, when caused by the overgrowth of hope, is a disease,—sometimes a fatal one.It would be no mean object for physiology to search out in what ways and by what means Thought produces the same internal disorganization as poison; and how it is that despair affects the appetite, destroys the pylorus, and changes all the physical conditions of the strongest life.Such was the case with Modeste.In three short days she became the image of morbid melancholy; she did not sing, she could not be made to smile.Charles Mignon, becoming uneasy at the non-arrival of the two friends, thought of going to fetch them, when, on the evening of the fifth day, he received news of their movements through Latournelle."
"卡那利想到这门有钱的婚事就万分欣喜，他决心不放过任何可以帮他击败拉布里埃的机会，然而也会不给拉布里埃机会责备他违反了友谊的原则。诗人觉得，要让一位少女瞧不起一个情人，最好的办法就是让他以低微的身份出现在她面前。于是，他表现出很自然的样子，以呼吸海边空气为由，建议和拉布里埃一起在安古维尔租一幢乡间小别墅，住上一个月。拉布里埃开始并没觉得这个建议有什么不妥，就答应了。卡那利立刻声称自己会支付所有费用，并派他的贴身男仆去勒阿弗尔，让他去见拉图奈尔先生，请他帮忙找房子——他很清楚这位公证人会把所有的细节都告诉米尼翁一家。正如我们所料想的，埃内斯特和卡那利曾就这场艳遇的各个方面交谈过，而且唠叨的埃内斯特已经给了他的情敌许多有用的提示。男仆很清楚他主人的意愿，一丝不苟地执行了它们。他大肆宣扬这位伟大诗人的到来，说他的身体被文学和政治上的双重辛劳给压垮了，医生建议他通过呼吸海边空气来恢复健康。这位大人物想租一套房子，说至少要有多少多少个房间，因为除了他自己——贴身男仆热尔曼·博内，卡那利还会带上一个秘书、一个厨师、两个仆人。卡那利挑选了一辆漂亮的马车，打算租用一个月，而热尔曼要找两匹好马，除了能拉马车，还得骑着舒服——因为据他所说，男爵先生和他的秘书还从事骑马运动。小个子拉图奈尔陪他去看了各种各样的房子，热尔曼当着他的面说了很多有关秘书的事。有两三处房子没看中，正是因为没有合适的房间给德拉布里埃先生。","Canalis, excessively delighted at the idea of a rich marriage, was determined to neglect nothing that might help him to cut out La Briere, without, however, giving La Briere a chance to reproach him for having violated the laws of friendship.The poet felt that nothing would lower a lover so much in the eyes of a young girl as to exhibit him in a subordinate position; and he therefore proposed to La Briere, in the most natural manner, to take a little country-house at Ingouville for a month, and live there together on pretence of requiring sea-air.As soon as La Briere, who at first saw nothing amiss in the proposal, had consented, Canalis declared that he should pay all expenses, and he sent his valet to Havre, telling him to see Monsieur Latournelle and get his assistance in choosing the house,—well aware that the notary would repeat all particulars to the Mignons.Ernest and Canalis had, as may well be supposed, talked over all the aspects of the affair, and the rather prolix Ernest had given a good many useful hints to his rival.The valet, understanding his master’s wishes, fulfilled them to the letter; he trumpeted the arrival of the great poet, for whom the doctors advised sea-air to restore his health, injured as it was by the double toils of literature and politics.This important personage wanted a house, which must have at least such and such a number of rooms, as he would bring with him a secretary, cook, two servants, and a coachman, not counting himself, Germain Bonnet, the valet.The carriage, selected and hired for a month by Canalis, was a pretty one; and Germain set about finding a pair of fine horses which would also answer as saddle-horses,—for, as he said, monsieur le baron and his secretary took horseback exercise.Under the eyes of little Latournelle, who went with him to various houses, Germain made a good deal of talk about the secretary, rejecting two or three because there was no suitable room for Monsieur de La Briere."
"“男爵先生，”他对公证人说，“把他的秘书当作他最好的朋友。啊！如果德拉布里埃先生没有得到像男爵先生本人那样周到的服侍，我会被狠狠地责备的。毕竟你也知道，德拉布里埃先生是我主人法院的一名律师。”","“Monsieur le baron,” he said to the notary, “makes his secretary quite his best friend.Ah! I should be well scolded if Monsieur de La Briere was not as well treated as monsieur le baron himself; and after all, you know, Monsieur de La Briere is a lawyer in my master’s court.”"
"热尔曼每次出现在公众场合，都是一丝不苟地全身着黑，戴着干干净净的手套，穿着擦得油亮的靴子，或者打扮成一副律师模样。想想看，他这样做在勒阿弗尔会产生什么影响，而人们会从这个小细节中对这位伟大诗人产生什么样的看法！一个机智聪明的主人，他的仆人最终也会从他身上蹭到点机智聪明。热尔曼没有把自己的角色表演过火，他按照卡那利的指示，表现得自然而又平易近人。可怜的拉布里埃沉浸在幸福中，完全没料到热尔曼对他的前途所造成的危害，也没想到经他同意的事竟贬低了他的身份。然而，一些有关事态发展的只言片语，的确从山脚下的勒阿弗尔传到了莫黛斯特耳朵里。","Germain never appeared in public unless punctiliously dressed in black, with spotless gloves, well-polished boots, and otherwise as well apparelled as a lawyer.Imagine the effect he produced in Havre, and the idea people took of the great poet from this sample of him!The valet of a man of wit and intellect ends by getting a little wit and intellect himself which has rubbed off from his master.Germain did not overplay his part; he was simple and good-humored, as Canalis had instructed him to be.Poor La Briere was in blissful ignorance of the harm Germain was doing to his prospects, and the depreciation his consent to the arrangement had brought upon him; it is, however, true that some inkling of the state of things rose to Modeste’s ears from these lower regions."
"卡那利安排他的秘书坐在自己的马车里，而埃内斯特不好猜忌的天性，使他没有意识到自己正渐渐陷入不利的处境。而等他发现时，想要弥补已经晚了。这两个人的姗姗来迟令夏尔·米尼翁颇为烦恼。其实他们之所以来晚，是因为卡那利把家徽漆在了马车的护板上，又在裁缝店做了衣服。那些数不清的细节，诗人没有漏掉一个，哪怕是最微不足道的一个，都可能影响一位少女的看法。","Canalis had arranged to bring his secretary in his own carriage, and Ernest’s unsuspicious nature did not perceive that he was putting himself in a false position until too late to remedy it.The delay in the arrival of the pair which had troubled Charles Mignon was caused by the painting of the Canalis arms on the panels of the carriage, and by certain orders given to a tailor; for the poet neglected none of the innumerable details which might, even the smallest of them, influence a young girl."
"“放心吧，”拉图奈尔在第六天对米尼翁说道，“男爵的贴身男仆已经花了七百法郎租下了阿莫里夫人在桑维克的别墅，里面配有全套家具。男仆已经给他的主人写信说可以出发了，等他到的时候一切就都准备好了。所以，这两位先生星期天就会到这儿了。我还收到了一封比查的来信，信不长，内容如下：‘我亲爱的主人——我要到星期天才能回去。在这段时间里，我有些非常重要的事要调查，它们关系到您所关心之人的幸福。’”","“It is all right,” said Latournelle to Mignon on the sixth day.“The baron’s valet has hired Madame Amaury’s villa at Sanvic, all furnished, for seven hundred francs; he has written to his master that he may start, and that all will be ready on his arrival.So the two gentlemen will be here Sunday.I have also had a letter from Butscha; here it is; it’s not long: ‘My dear master,—I cannot get back till Sunday.Between now and then I have some very important inquiries to make which concern the happiness of a person in whom you take an interest.’”"
"两人即将到来的消息并没有让莫黛斯特走出忧郁，她的挫败感和内心的困惑还是很严重。她并不像她父亲所认为的那样爱卖弄风情。其实，有一种可爱的卖弄风情是可以被允许的，那就是心灵上的卖弄风情，可以被看作是爱情上的彬彬有礼。夏尔·米尼翁在责备他女儿的时候，没能区分开想取悦他人的单纯愿望和精神层面的爱情——对爱情的渴望，对博得他人赞美的渴望。跟法兰西帝国每一位真正的中校一样，他在这些匆匆读过的信件里，看到的只是一个自己扑到诗人怀里的姑娘。但在那些我们为了节省笔墨而不得不略去的信件里，一个更好的法官会赞赏莫黛斯特用高贵、亲切的矜持代替了她最开始的几封信中那盛气凌人、漫不经心的语气。然而，这位父亲只有一点是非常正确的。我们读过的莫黛斯特那最后一封信，话说得确实就像婚事已成定局的样子。所以，一想起那封信，她就羞愧不已。父亲逼着她去面对一个她曾经坦诚相交、现在却配不上她的人，她觉得父亲太过严厉，太过残忍了。她问过迪迈同诗人的面谈，哄骗着他说出了每一个细节。她认为卡那利并不像中尉所说的那样粗野、残忍。一想到这位文坛唐璜那装着一千零一封女人来信的漂亮小匣子，她就微笑起来。她真的很想跟她父亲说：“我不是唯一一个给他写信的人，那些女精英们也给这位诗人的桂冠送去了她们的叶片。”","The announcement of this arrival did not rouse Modeste from her gloom; the sense of her fall and the bewilderment of her mind were still too great, and she was not nearly as much of a coquette as her father thought her to be.There is, in truth, a charming and permissible coquetry, that of the soul, which may claim to be love’s politeness.Charles Mignon, when scolding his daughter, failed to distinguish between the mere desire of pleasing and the love of the mind,—the thirst for love, and the thirst for admiration.Like every true colonel of the Empire he saw in this correspondence, rapidly read, only the young girl who had thrown herself at the head of a poet; but in the letters which we were forced to lack of space to suppress, a better judge would have admired the dignified and gracious reserve which Modeste had substituted for the rather aggressive and light-minded tone of her first letters.The father, however, was only too cruelly right on one point.Modeste’s last letter, which we have read, had indeed spoken as though the marriage were a settled fact, and the remembrance of that letter filled her with shame; she thought her father very harsh and cruel to force her to receive a man unworthy of her, yet to whom her soul had flown, as it were, bare.She questioned Dumay about his interview with the poet, she inveigled him into relating its every detail, and she did not think Canalis as barbarous as the lieutenant had declared him.The thought of the beautiful casket which held the letters of the thousand and one women of this literary Don Juan made her smile, and she was strongly tempted to say to her father: “I am not the only one to write to him; the elite of my sex send their leaves for the laurel wreath of the poet.”"
"这一个星期里，莫黛斯特的性格经历了一次蜕变。这场灾难——而且对她那诗意的天性来说是一场很大的灾难——唤起了潜伏在她少女之心里的洞察力和敌意。她的追求者们即将遇上一位十分可怕的对手。事实是，当一个女人心寒之后，她的头脑就变清晰了。她会以极其敏锐的判断力进行观察，还带着些玩世不恭。莎士比亚《无事生非》中的比阿特丽斯就是这种玩世不恭的风度的绝好体现。既然最卓越的男人都让莫黛斯特的希望破灭了，她便对男人产生了一种深深的厌恶。当一个女人恋爱时，她厌恶的恰恰是她能够看透的东西；但在感情的问题上，特别是对少女而言，她们从来就无法看透。如果她不能爱慕，她就会鄙视。所以，在经过心灵的激烈挣扎之后，莫黛斯特必然穿上了盔甲，正如她曾经说过的，那上面刻着“鄙视”这个词。从这时起，在她津津乐道的那出“求婚者的闹剧”中，她将能以事不关己的旁观者身份参与其中，并亲自扮演女主角。她特别打定主意，要羞辱德拉布里埃先生，以此来获得满足感。","During this week Modeste’s character underwent a transformation.The catastrophe—and it was a great one to her poetic nature—roused a faculty of discernment and also the malice latent in her girlish heart, in which her suitors were about to encounter a formidable adversary.It is a fact that when a young woman’s heart is chilled her head becomes clear; she observes with great rapidity of judgment, and with a tinge of pleasantry which Shakespeare’s Beatrice so admirably represents in “Much Ado about Nothing.”Modeste was seized with a deep disgust for men, now that the most distinguished among them had betrayed her hopes.When a woman loves, what she takes for disgust is simply the ability to see clearly; but in matters of sentiment she is never, especially if she is a young girl, in a condition to see clearly.If she cannot admire, she despises.And so, after passing through terrible struggles of the soul, Modeste necessarily put on the armor on which, as she had once declared, the word “Disdain” was engraved.After reaching that point she was able, in the character of uninterested spectator, to take part in what she was pleased to call the “farce of the suitors,” a performance in which she herself was about to play the role of heroine.She particularly set before her mind the satisfaction of humiliating Monsieur de La Briere."
"“莫黛斯特得救了，”米尼翁夫人对她的丈夫说，“她想通过爱上真正的卡那利来报复假卡那利。”","“Modeste is saved,” said Madame Mignon to her husband; “she wants to revenge herself on the false Canalis by trying to love the real one.”"
"这确实是莫黛斯特的计划。这种做法庸俗至极。于是，在她向母亲吐露了自己的伤痛后，母亲反而劝她绝对要彬彬有礼地对待德拉布里埃先生。","Such in truth was Modeste’s plan.It was so utterly commonplace that her mother, to whom she confided her griefs, advised her on the contrary to treat Monsieur de La Briere with extreme politeness."
"第十七章 第三位追求者","Chapter XVII A Third Suitor"
"“那两位年轻人，”星期六晚上，拉图奈尔夫人说道，“他们还不知道有多少个间谍跟着他们呢。我们一共有八个人，都在看着他们呢。”","“Those two young men,” said Madame Latournelle, on the Saturday evening, “have no idea how many spies they have on their tracks.We are eight in all, on the watch.”"
"“老伴，别说两个年轻人，是三个！”小个子拉图奈尔看看四周，大声说道，“哥本海姆不在这儿，所以我可以说出来。”","“Don’t say two young men, wife; say three!” cried little Latournelle, looking round him.“Gobenheim is not here, so I can speak out.”"
"莫黛斯特抬起了头，其他人也都跟她一样，抬起头来看着公证人。","Modeste raised her head, and everybody, imitating Modeste, raised theirs and looked at the notary."
"“是的，第三个对小姐钟情的人——还是个了不起的情人——也来毛遂自荐了。”","“Yes, a third lover—and he is something like a lover—offers himself as a candidate.”"
"“啊！”中校惊呼道。","“Bah!” exclaimed the colonel."
"“我说的不是别人，”拉图奈尔自豪地说，“正是埃鲁维尔公爵先生，他也是圣瑟韦侯爵、尼沃隆公爵、巴约伯爵、埃西尼子爵，法国马厩大总管和贵族议员，马刺教派和金羊毛教派的骑士，西班牙大公，诺曼底前任省长之子。他在维尔坎家小住的时候，看到过莫黛斯特小姐。他的公证人昨天从巴约来告诉我说，他当时就为莫黛斯特不够富有、达不到他的要求而感到遗憾，因为他父亲回到法国时，手中只剩下了埃鲁维尔庄园，这里面还有他姐姐的一份。这位年轻的公爵现年三十三岁。我实在是受人之托向你们讲出这些的，伯爵先生。”公证人毕恭毕敬地转向中校，补充道。","“I speak of no less a person,” said Latournelle, pompously, “than Monsieur le Duc d’Herouville, Marquis de Saint-Sever, Duc de Nivron, Comte de Bayeux, Vicomte d’Essigny, grand equerry and peer of France, knight of the Spur and the Golden Fleece, grandee of Spain, and son of the last governor of Normandy.He saw Mademoiselle Modeste at the time when he was staying with the Vilquins, and he regretted then—as his notary, who came from Bayeux yesterday, tells me—that she was not rich enough for him; for his father recovered nothing but the estate of Herouville on his return to France, and that is saddled with a sister.The young duke is thirty-three years old.I am definitively charged to lay these proposals before you, Monsieur le comte,” added the notary, turning respectfully to the colonel."
"“你可以问问莫黛斯特，愿不愿意往她的笼子里再加一只鸟，”伯爵回答道，“就我而言，我倒情愿这位马厩大总管阁下来关注一下她。”","“Ask Modeste if she wants another bird in her cage,” replied the count; “as far as I am concerned, I am willing that my lord the grand equerry shall pay her attention.”"
"尽管夏尔·米尼翁小心翼翼地避免见外人，而且总呆在木屋，出门时也总是跟莫黛斯特一起，但哥本海姆还是将迪迈发财的事传了出去，因为迪迈在辞掉出纳员职务时跟他说：“我要做中校的管家，而且我所有的财产，除了我夫人所需要的那部分，都将给我们的小莫黛斯特的子女。”于是，勒阿弗尔的每个人都提出了公证人对自己提的那个问题：“如果迪迈那份收益是六十万法郎，他还要做米尼翁先生的管家，那么米尼翁先生一定有一笔巨大的财产。他驾着自己装满了靛蓝染料的船在马赛靠岸，而且交易所的人说，不算船的价值，光是那些货物的价值都比他对外宣称的总家产要多。”","Notwithstanding the care with which Charles Mignon avoided seeing people, and though he stayed in the Chalet and never went out without Modeste, Gobenheim had reported Dumay’s wealth; for Dumay had said to him when giving up his position as cashier: “I am to be bailiff for my colonel, and all my fortune, except what my wife needs, is to go to the children of our little Modeste.”Every one in Havre had therefore propounded the same question that the notary had already put to himself: “If Dumay’s share in the profits is six hundred thousand francs, and he is going to be Monsieur Mignon’s bailiff, then Monsieur Mignon must certainly have a colossal fortune.He arrived at Marseilles on a ship of his own, loaded with indigo; and they say at the Bourse that the cargo, not counting the ship, is worth more than he gives out as his whole fortune.”"
"中校不想辞退他带回来的那些仆人，他们都是他在旅途中精心挑选出来的。因此，他在安古维尔山坡为他们租了一套房子，安置他的贴身男仆、厨师和马夫，他们都是黑人，其中三个是黑白混血的，个个都值得信赖。马夫接到吩咐，去为小姐和他的主人物色骑用马匹，并为中校和中尉回勒阿弗尔时坐的轻便马车物色驾车马匹。那驾马车是从巴黎买的，是最新款式，漆着拉巴斯蒂家徽，上面还有伯爵宝冠。这些东西，对一个四年来见惯了印度群岛以及广州的英国商人那种极尽奢华的生活的人来说，是微不足道的，但对于勒阿弗尔的商人以及安古维尔和格拉维尔的居民，却是诸多评论的主题。还不到五天，传闻就像是一串点了火的火药，从诺曼底的这一头传到了另一头。","The colonel was unwilling to dismiss the servants he had brought back with him, whom he had chosen with care during his travels; and he therefore hired a house for them in the lower part of Ingouville, where he installed his valet, cook, and coachman, all Negroes, and three mulattos on whose fidelity he could rely.The coachman was told to search for saddle-horses for Mademoiselle and for his master, and for carriage-horses for the caleche in which the colonel and the lieutenant had returned to Havre.That carriage, bought in Paris, was of the latest fashion, and bore the arms of La Bastie, surmounted by a count’s coronet.These things, insignificant in the eyes of a man who for four years had been accustomed to the unbridled luxury of the Indies and of the English merchants at Canton, were the subject of much comment among the business men of Havre and the inhabitants of Ingouville and Graville.Before five days had elapsed the rumor of them ran from one end of Normandy to the other like a train of gunpowder touched by fire."
"“米尼翁先生从中国赚了几百万回来了，”一个鲁昂人说道，“而且好像他在海上就成了伯爵。”","“Monsieur Mignon has come back from China with millions,” some one said in Rouen; “and it seems he was made a count in mid-ocean.”"
"“可大革命之前他就是拉巴斯蒂伯爵啊。”另一个人回应道。","“But he was the Comte de La Bastie before the Revolution,” answered another."
"“所以他们称他为自由党人，因为他二十五年来都直呼自己夏尔·米尼翁！我们会得到什么啊？”第三个人说道。","“So they call him a liberal just because he was plain Charles Mignon for twenty-five years!What are we coming to?” said a third."
"因此，尽管莫黛斯特的父母和朋友都保持沉默，她还是被认为是诺曼底最富有的女嗣，所有的眼睛又开始看到她的价值了。埃鲁维尔公爵的姑姑和姐姐在巴约的贵族沙龙上肯定地说，夏尔·米尼翁先生有权继承源自米尼翁红衣主教的伯爵头衔和家徽。家徽上的红衣主教帽子和流苏就是为了纪念这位主教而加上去的。他们在维尔坎家小住的时候，见过德拉巴斯蒂小姐，现在，他们倒关心起这个家道中落的家族的家长来了。","Modeste was considered, therefore, notwithstanding the silence of her parents and friends, as the richest heiress in Normandy, and all eyes began once more to see her merits.The aunt and sister of the Duc d’Herouville confirmed in the aristocratic salons of Bayeux Monsieur Charles Mignon’s right to the title and arms of count, derived from Cardinal Mignon, for whom the Cardinal’s hat and tassels were added as a crest.They had seen Mademoiselle de La Bastie when they were staying at the Vilquins, and their solicitude for the impoverished head of their house now became active."
"“如果德拉巴斯蒂小姐真的既漂亮又富有，”这位年轻公爵的姑姑说，“那她就是全省男子的最佳选择。她至少是位贵族。”","“If Mademoiselle de La Bastie is really as rich as she is beautiful,” said the aunt of the young duke, “she is the best match in the province.She at least is noble.”"
"这最后一句话是针对维尔坎家族说的，因为埃鲁维尔公爵曾经住在这个中产阶级家庭里，却没和他家的女儿谈成婚事，真是奇耻大辱。","The last words were aimed at the Vilquins, with whom they had not been able to come to terms, after incurring the humiliation of staying in that bourgeois household."
"在介绍我们故事中的一个新角色之前，讲讲这些琐事是有必要的，当然，这有悖亚里士多德和贺拉斯文学准则。但是，考虑到这个姗姗来迟的人物身材极为矮小，他的肖像和传记也不会太长。这位马厩大总管在这里所占的篇幅，不会比他在历史上所占的长。埃鲁维尔公爵先生，是前任诺曼底省长流亡国外期间的老来子，一七九九年生于维也纳。公爵的父亲是位老元帅，一八一四年同国王一起回国，一八一九年去世，死前没能给他儿子完婚。他只给儿子留下了埃鲁维尔大城堡、猎园、一些附属建筑，以及一座好不容易才赎回的田庄，所有这些地产的年租金收入约一万五千法郎。路易十八授予这位儿子马厩大总管之职，到了查理十世时期，他又享受到给法国破落贵族的一万二千法郎日常津贴。但对于这样一个家族来说，这两万七千法郎的年收入加上马厩大总管的薪俸，又算什么呢？当然，在巴黎，这位年轻的公爵用的是国王的马车，而且在卢浮宫圣托马斯街的王室马厩附近有一座公馆，他的薪俸可供他在巴黎城内过冬之用，而那两万七千法郎则是夏天在诺曼底的费用。这位贵族人物至今还是单身，这不能怪他自己，而要怪他那位不精通拉封丹寓言故事的姑姑。德埃鲁维尔小姐极度的矫揉造作完全是为了追赶当今的时代精神，因为再显赫的家族如果没有钱来支撑，也很难赢得法国高等贵族的女嗣的芳心。而那些高等贵族自己也窘迫不已，因为根据新法律中平均分配财产的规定，他们的儿子也得由他们供养。要让年轻的埃鲁维尔公爵娶到老婆，就必须要讨好那些大银行家家族，但这位傲慢自大的德埃鲁维尔家小姐说话尖酸刻薄，把这些人都给得罪了。王政复辟的头几年里，从一八一七年到一八二五年，德埃鲁维尔小姐虽然在寻求百万人家，却也拒绝了许多人家。其中就有银行家蒙日诺的女儿，后来，德方丹先生很满意地娶了她。","Such were the little events which, contrary to the rules of Aristotle and of Horace, precede the introduction of another person into our story; but the portrait and the biography of this personage, this late arrival, shall not be long, taking into consideration his own diminutiveness.The grand equerry shall not take more space here than he will take in history.Monsieur le Duc d’Herouville, offspring of the matrimonial autumn of the last governor of Normandy, was born during the emigration in 1799, at Vienna.The old marechal, father of the present duke, returned with the king in 1814, and died in 1819, before he was able to marry his son.He could only leave him the vast chateau of Herouville, the park, a few dependencies, and a farm which he had bought back with some difficulty; all of which returned a rental of about fifteen thousand francs a year.Louis XVIII. gave the post of grand equerry to the son, who, under Charles X., received the usual pension of twelve thousand francs which was granted to the pauper peers of France.But what were these twenty-seven thousand francs a year and the salary of grand equerry to such a family?In Paris, of course, the young duke used the king’s coaches, and had a mansion provided for him in the rue Saint-Thomas-du-Louvre, near the royal stables; his salary paid for his winters in the city, and his twenty-seven thousand francs for the summers in Normandy.If this noble personage was still a bachelor he was less to blame than his aunt, who was not versed in La Fontaine’s fables.Mademoiselle d’Herouville made enormous pretensions wholly out of keeping with the spirit of the times; for great names, without the money to keep them up, can seldom win rich heiresses among the higher French nobility, who are themselves embarrassed to provide for their sons under the new law of the equal division of property.To marry the young Duc d’Herouville, it was necessary to conciliate the great banking-houses; but the haughty pride of the daughter of the house alienated these people by cutting speeches.During the first years of the Restoration, from 1817 to 1825, Mademoiselle d’Herouville, though in quest of millions, refused, among others, the daughter of Mongenod the banker, with whom Monsieur de Fontaine afterwards contented himself."
"最后，完全由于她自己的过失，错过了许多替她侄子完婚的好机会。可她还在考虑纽沁根家族的财产是不是来路不正，她要不要成全德纽沁根夫人想让自己女儿成为公爵夫人的野心。国王急于让德埃鲁维尔家族恢复昔日的光彩，差一点儿就成全了这门亲事，而当事情搞砸后，他公开批评了德埃鲁维尔小姐的愚蠢做法。就这样，这位姑姑将她的侄子置于了可笑的境地中，而这位侄子自己也确实挺荒谬。当伟大事物消逝时，它们会留下碎片，拉伯雷称之为“掉下来的渣渣”。而这个世纪的法国贵族给我们留下了太多这样的碎片。无论是牧师还是贵族，在这段悠长的风俗史中都没有什么好抱怨的。那些伟大而辉煌的社会必需品已经被很好地呈现出来了，但如果我们不公正地在这里描述一下贵族们如今的没落，尽管我们已经在其他地方这样做过了——如莫尔索伯爵的形象（见《幽谷百合》）、“朗热女公爵”，还有极具贵族气质的德埃斯巴侯爵——那我们当然应该宣布放弃历史学家这一高尚头衔。那么，那个孕育了英雄和勇士的、光荣的埃鲁维尔家族，给国家输送了著名的元帅，给教会输送了几个红衣主教，给瓦罗亚王朝输送了许多伟大领袖，给路易十四输送了好多骑士，最后会没落成到只剩一个孱弱的、比比查还矮小的男嗣呢？在巴黎的不止一个沙龙里，当我们听到法兰西最伟大家族的名字被通报，却看到进来的是一个瘦弱干瘪、身材矮小、几乎只剩最后一口气的年轻人，或一个未老先衰的人，或一个很难从他身上看到昔日荣光的稀奇古怪的人，我们都会问自己这样的问题。路易十五王朝的荒淫无度，那个宿命而自我的时代的纵酒狂欢，造就了软弱无能的一代。在他们身上，高贵的品质都已消失，只剩下那套举止——表面形式，那也是我们的贵族保留下来的唯一遗产。蓬巴杜夫人统治期间留下的后遗症，多多少少也能解释路易十六及其王朝的覆灭。","At last, having lost several good opportunities to establish her nephew, entirely through her own fault, she was just considering whether the property of the Nucingens was not too basely acquired, or whether she should lend herself to the ambition of Madame de Nucingen, who wished to make her daughter a duchess.The king, anxious to restore the d’Herouvilles to their former splendor, had almost brought about this marriage, and when it failed he openly accused Mademoiselle d’Herouville of folly.In this way the aunt made the nephew ridiculous, and the nephew, in his own way, was not less absurd.When great things disappear they leave crumbs, “frusteaux,” Rabelais would say, behind them; and the French nobility of this century has left us too many such fragments.Neither the clergy nor the nobility have anything to complain of in this long history of manners and customs.Those great and magnificent social necessities have been well represented; but we ought surely to renounce the noble title of historian if we are not impartial, if we do not here depict the present degeneracy of the race of nobles, although we have already done so elsewhere,—in the character of the Comte de Mortsauf (in “The Lily of the Valley”), in the “Duchesse de Langeais,” and the very nobleness of the nobility in the “Marquis d’Espard.”How then could it be that the race of heroes and valiant men belonging to the proud house of Herouville, who gave the famous marshal to the nation, cardinals to the church, great leaders to the Valois, knights to Louis XIV., was reduced to a little fragile being smaller than Butscha?That is a question which we ask ourselves in more than one salon in Paris when we hear the greatest names of France announced, and see the entrance of a thin, pinched, undersized young man, scarcely possessing the breath of life, or a premature old one, or some whimsical creature in whom an observer can with great difficulty trace the signs of a past grandeur.The dissipations of the reign of Louis XV., the orgies of that fatal and egotistic period, have produced an effete generation, in which manners alone survive the nobler vanished qualities,—forms, which are the sole heritage our nobles have preserved.The abandonment in which Louis XVI. was allowed to perish may thus be explained, with some slight reservations, as a wretched result of the reign of Madame de Pompadour."
"这位马厩大总管是个不错的年轻人，蓝眼睛，面色苍白，倒也不是没有一些高贵的思想，但他那纤瘦矮小的身材，加上他姑姑带他到维尔坎家还有其他地方去求婚的愚蠢之举，使他极度缺乏自信。由于一个畸形之人的所作所为，埃鲁维尔家族已经受到过绝嗣的威胁了（见“哲理研究”部分《被诅咒的孩子》）。那位大元帅——家族中对被路易十三封为公爵的成员的专门称呼——八十岁的时候才结婚。这位年轻的公爵喜欢女人，但把她们放到了太高的位置上，过于尊重她们。事实上，他崇拜她们，而只有跟他不尊重的人在一起，他才感觉自在。这种性格导致他过着一种双重生活。他在圣日耳曼近郊的沙龙里——你也可以说是女人们的会客室里——对那些女人顶礼膜拜，但又到水性杨花的女人那里寻求补偿。这些习惯，加上他弱小的身材，一副苦脸，还有心醉神迷地向上翻的蓝眼睛，更增加了他身上已有的可笑之处——上帝赋予他这些可笑之处，真是不公平，因为他充满才智、心思细腻，但他的才智从来不发光，只有在他感觉自在的时候才会表现出来。据说，女演员范妮·博普雷是他花了大钱结交的最亲密的朋友，她称他为“一瓶瓶塞塞得太紧、会弄坏你所有开瓶器的好酒。”这位马厩大总管对美丽的摩弗里纽斯公爵夫人就只有爱慕的份儿了。她说过一句让大总管彻底崩溃的话，不幸的是，这句话还像所有这类精辟的恶毒话一样，被人们口口相传。","The grand equerry, a fair young man with blue eyes and a pallid face, was not without a certain dignity of thought; but his thin, undersized figure, and the follies of his aunt who had taken him to the Vilquins and elsewhere to pay his court, rendered him extremely diffident.The house of Herouville had already been threatened with extinction by the deed of a deformed being (see the “Enfant Maudit” in “Philosophical Studies”).The grand marshal, that being the family term for the member who was made duke by Louis XIII., married at the age of eighty.The young duke admired women, but he placed them too high and respected them too much; in fact, he adored them, and was only at his ease with those whom he could not respect.This characteristic caused him to lead a double life.He found compensation with women of easy virtue for the worship to which he surrendered himself in the salons, or, if you like, the boudoirs, of the faubourg Saint-Germain.Such habits and his puny figure, his suffering face with its blue eyes turning upward in ecstasy, increased the ridicule already bestowed upon him,—very unjustly bestowed, as it happened, for he was full of wit and delicacy; but his wit, which never sparkled, only showed itself when he felt at ease.Fanny Beaupre, an actress who was supposed to be his nearest friend (at a price), called him “a sound wine so carefully corked that you break all your corkscrews.”The beautiful Duchesse de Maufrigneuse, whom the grand equerry could only worship, annihilated him with a speech which, unfortunately, was repeated from mouth to mouth, like all such pretty and malicious sayings."
"“对我来说，”她说，“他总像是一件做工精良的珠宝饰物，我们展示它，却从来不佩戴，只是把它存放在棉花团里。”","“He always seems to me,” she said, “like one of those jewels of fine workmanship which we exhibit but never wear, and keep in cotton-wool.”"
"有关他的一切，甚至是他那有些荒谬、与本人形成鲜明对比的马厩大总管头衔，都让和蔼可亲的国王查理十世乐得发笑——尽管埃鲁维尔公爵已证明了他能胜任自己的工作——做一位优秀的驯马师。人就像书，通常是太晚才被理解和赏识。公爵去维尔坎家进行那次无果的拜访期间，莫黛斯特见过他。她看着他来到又离开，脑海中闪过许多诸如此类的印象。但以她目前的处境来看，她清楚地知道埃鲁维尔公爵的追求将使她免受任何一个卡那利的摆布。","Everything about him, even to his absurdly contrasting title of grand equerry, amused the good-natured king, Charles X., and made him laugh,—although the Duc d’Herouville justified his appointment in the matter of being a fine horseman.Men are like books, often understood and appreciated too late.Modeste had seen the duke during his fruitless visit to the Vilquins, and many of these reflections passed through her mind as she watched him come and go.But under the circumstances in which she now found herself, she saw plainly that the courtship of the Duc d’Herouville would save her from being at the mercy of either Canalis."
"“我找不到任何理由，”她跟拉图奈尔说，“为什么埃鲁维尔公爵不能被接纳。虽然我们家境贫寒，”她淘气地看着父亲，继续说道，“但我已经是女继承人了。难道你们没有注意到哥本海姆的眼神吗？他的眼神在一个星期里已经有了很大的变化。他不能通过来这儿玩牌来表达对我魅力的无言爱慕了，正对此失望不已呢。”","“I see no reason,” she said to Latournelle, “why the Duc d’Herouville should not be received.I have passed, in spite of our indigence,” she continued, with a mischievous look at her father, “to the condition of heiress.Haven’t you observed Gobenheim’s glances?They have quite changed their character within a week.He is in despair at not being able to make his games of whist count for mute adoration of my charms.”"
"“嘘，我的宝贝！”拉图奈尔夫人大声说，“他来了。”","“Hush, my darling!” cried Madame Latournelle, “here he comes.”"
"“老阿尔图正伤心绝望呢。”哥本海姆一进门就对米尼翁先生说道。","“Old Althor is in despair,” said Gobenheim to Monsieur Mignon as he entered."
"“为什么？”伯爵问道。","“Why?” asked the count."
"“维尔坎就要破产了，而交易所认为你有几百万的身家。他儿子真是不幸哪！”","“Vilquin is going to fail; and the Bourse thinks you are worth several millions.What ill-luck for his son!”"
"“没有人知道我在印度负了多少债，”夏尔·米尼翁冷冷地说道，“而我也不打算向公众透露我的私人事务。迪迈，”他对他的朋友轻声说道，“如果维尔坎手头拮据，我们就能按他原来给出的价钱买回别墅了。”","“No one knows,” said Charles Mignon, coldly, “what my liabilities in India are; and I do not intend to take the public into my confidence as to my private affairs.Dumay,” he whispered to his friend, “if Vilquin is embarrassed we could get back the villa by paying him what he gave for it.”"
"这就是机缘安排下事态的大致状况。此刻，卡那利和拉布里埃由一名信使打前锋，于星期天早晨到了阿莫里夫人的公馆。据说埃鲁维尔公爵、他的姐姐，还有他的姑姑下个星期二也要以身体欠佳为由过来，住进在格拉维尔租的一幢房子。交易所里爱开玩笑的人看到求婚者云集而来，说多亏了米尼翁小姐，安古维尔的房租要涨了。“再这样继续下去，她要在这儿开一家旅客招待所了。”苦于不能成为公爵夫人的维尔坎二小姐说道。","Such was the general state of things, due chiefly to accident, when on Sunday morning Canalis and La Briere arrived, with a courier in advance, at the villa of Madame Amaury.It was known that the Duc d’Herouville, his sister, and his aunt were coming the following Tuesday to occupy, also under pretext of ill-health, a hired house at Graville.This assemblage of suitors made the wits of the Bourse remark that, thanks to Mademoiselle Mignon, rents would rise at Ingouville.“If this goes on, she will have a hospital here,” said the younger Mademoiselle Vilquin, vexed at not becoming a duchess."
"《女继承人》这出永不休止的喜剧即将在木屋上演，而以莫黛斯特此刻的心境来看，这出剧也可以被称为《一位少女的远大计划》，因为自从她的幻想破灭后，她就下定决心，不向任何一个品格不能完全让她满意的男人伸出她的手。","The everlasting comedy of “The Heiress,” about to be played at the Chalet, might very well be called, in view of Modeste’s frame of mind, “The Designs of a Young Girl”; for since the overthrow of her illusions she had fully made up her mind to give her hand to no man whose qualifications did not fully satisfy her."
"这两位仍是挚友的情敌，准备在他们到达的第二天晚上首次拜访木屋。他们花了星期天一整天和星期一的部分时间拆行李、布置阿莫里夫人的公馆，以便在那里呆上一个月。诗人总在算计。他的到来会在勒阿弗尔造成一定的轰动，当然也会影响到米尼翁家，他希望最大限度地利用这一点。因此，他假装自己需要休息，没有出门。拉布里埃两次散步经过木屋，但总是带着一种绝望的心情，因为他害怕让莫黛斯特不高兴，而且未来对他而言似乎是阴云密布。两位朋友星期一下楼用餐时，都已为这次重要的拜访穿戴完毕。拉布里埃的穿着跟他为那个美好的星期天精心挑选的衣服一样。但他此刻却觉得自己像某个星球的卫星，任凭当前状况下的不确定因素摆布。另一方面，卡那利精心打理了他的黑色外套和勋章，复习了会客室中所有体现高雅风度的小细节。他与德肖利厄公爵夫人以及圣日耳曼近郊上流社会的密切关系，使得这些优雅的小细节臻于完美。他潜心研究花花公子所讲究的细枝末节，而可怜的拉布里埃则打算以一个无望之人不修边幅的形象出现。热尔曼在伺候两位进餐时，看到这鲜明的对比，忍不住暗自发笑。然而，上完第二道菜，这位贴身男仆颇具外交官风范地——也就是颇为不安地走了进来。","The two rivals, still intimate friends, intended to pay their first visit at the Chalet on the evening of the day succeeding their arrival.They had spent Sunday and part of Monday in unpacking and arranging Madame Amaury’s house for a month’s stay.The poet, always calculating effects, wished to make the most of the probable excitement which his arrival would cause in Havre, and which would of course echo up to the Mignons.Therefore, in his role of a man needing rest, he did not leave the house.La Briere went twice to walk past the Chalet, though always with a sense of despair, for he feared to displease Modeste, and the future seemed to him dark with clouds.The two friends came down to dinner on Monday dressed for the momentous visit.La Briere wore the same clothes he had so carefully selected for the famous Sunday; but he now felt like the satellite of planet, and resigned himself to the uncertainties of his situation.Canalis, on the other hand, had carefully attended to his black coat, his orders, and all those little drawing-room elegancies, which his intimacy with the Duchesse de Chaulieu and the fashionable world of the faubourg had brought to perfection.He had gone into the minutiae of dandyism, while poor La Briere was about to present himself with the negligence of a man without hope.Germain, as he waited at dinner could not help smiling to himself at the contrast.After the second course, however, the valet came in with a diplomatic, that is to say, uneasy air."
"“男爵先生知不知道，”他低声对卡那利说道，“马厩大总管先生要到格拉维尔来，也是为了医治让德拉布里埃先生和男爵先生来到海边的那一种病？”","“Does Monsieur le baron know,” he said to Canalis in a low voice, “that Monsieur the grand equerry is coming to Graville to get cured of the same illness which has brought Monsieur de La Briere and Monsieur le baron to the sea-shore?”"
"“什么？那个小个子埃鲁维尔公爵？”","“What, the little Duc d’Herouville?”"
"“是的，先生。”","“Yes, monsieur.”"
"“他是为德拉巴斯蒂小姐而来吗？”拉布里埃涨红了脸问道。","“Is he coming for Mademoiselle de La Bastie?” asked La Briere, coloring."
"“看来是这样的，先生。”","“So it appears, monsieur.”"
"“我们被骗了！”卡那利看着拉布里埃，大叫道。","“We are cheated!” cried Canalis looking at La Briere."
"“啊！”埃内斯特迅速反驳道，“这是你从离开巴黎到现在第一次说‘我们’，之前你一路上都是说‘我’的。”","“Ah!” retorted Ernest quickly, “that is the first time you have said, ‘we’ since we left Paris: it has been ‘I’ all along.”"
"“你真了解我。”卡那利突然放声大笑，“但我们斗不过公爵的宝冠，斗不过公爵的头衔，也斗不过国务院根据我的呈文刚刚批给埃鲁维尔家族的空地。”","“You understood me,” cried Canalis, with a burst of laughter.“But we are not in a position to struggle against a ducal coronet, nor the duke’s title, nor against the waste lands which the Council of State have just granted, on my report, to the house of Herouville.”"
"“这位大人，”拉布里埃以一种讽刺而又严肃的口吻说道，“可以把他的姐姐许配给你当作补偿嘛。”","“His grace,” said La Briere, with a spice of malice that was nevertheless serious, “will furnish you with compensation in the person of his sister.”"
"这时候，仆人通报说德拉巴斯蒂伯爵来了，两位年轻人立刻站了起来，拉布里埃赶快上前去为卡那利引见。","At this instant, the Comte de La Bastie was announced; the two young men rose at once, and La Briere hastened forward to present Canalis."
"“在巴黎您去看过我，我这是回访，”伯爵对这位年轻的律师说，“而且我知道，我来这里还能问候我们当代的一位伟大诗人，真是令我加倍高兴。”","“I wished to return the visit that you paid me in Paris,” said the count to the young lawyer, “and I knew that by coming here I should have the double pleasure of greeting one of our great living poets.”"
"“伟大！——先生，”诗人笑着回答，“在一个以拿破仑的统治为序幕的世纪里，没有谁能称得上伟大。我们是想成为伟大诗人的一群人，另外，二流才子如今也模仿天才，已经不可能将这二者区分开来了。”","“Great!—Monsieur,” replied the poet, smiling, “no one can be great in a century prefaced by the reign of a Napoleon.We are a tribe of would-be great poets; besides, second-rate talent imitates genius nowadays, and renders real distinction impossible.”"
"“这就是您从政的原因吗？”伯爵问道。","“Is that the reason why you have thrown yourself into politics?” asked the count."
"“那个领域也一样，”诗人说，“当今也没什么政治家了，只有一些多多少少处理政务的人。您看，先生，宪章把赋税变得比徽章还重要，这样的宪章衍生出的政体之下，除了您到中国去寻找的东西——财富，没有什么是绝对实在的。”","“It is the same thing in that sphere,” said the poet; “there are no statesmen in these days, only men who handle events more or less.Look at it, monsieur; under the system of government that we derive from the Charter, which makes a tax-list of more importance than a coat-of-arms, there is absolutely nothing solid except that which you went to seek in China,—wealth.”"
"卡那利自我感觉良好，也对他给未来岳父大人留下的印象感到满意，便转向热尔曼。","Satisfied with himself and with the impression he was making on the prospective father-inlaw, Canalis turned to Germain."
"“在客厅里上咖啡。”一面说着，一面请德拉巴斯蒂先生离开餐厅。","“Serve the coffee in the salon,” he said, inviting Monsieur de La Bastie to leave the dining-room."
"“感谢您大驾光临，伯爵先生，”拉布里埃说，“我正为怎样把我的朋友带到您家里见您而为难呢，您正好给我解了围。您心地善良，而且机智敏捷。”","“I thank you for this visit, monsieur le comte,” said La Briere; “it saves me from the embarrassment of presenting my friend to you in your own house.You have a heart, and you have also a quick mind.”"
"“呵！这只是普罗旺斯人的小聪明罢了。”夏尔·米尼翁说。","“Bah! the ready wit of Provence, that is all,” said Charles Mignon."
"“啊，您是普罗旺斯人？”卡那利大叫道。","“Ah, do you come from Provence?” cried Canalis."
"“请您一定原谅我的朋友，”拉布里埃说，“他还没像我这样研究过拉巴斯蒂家族的历史。”","“You must pardon my friend,” said La Briere; “he has not studied, as I have, the history of La Bastie.”"
"听到“朋友”这个词，卡那利向埃内斯特投去了探询的目光。","At the word friend Canalis threw a searching glance at Ernest."
"“如果您的健康状况允许的话，”伯爵对诗人说道，“我想请您今晚光临寒舍，这将是值得铭记的一天，正如古老的作家所说：‘albo notanda lapillo’。虽然在我们那小房子里接待一位如此大名鼎鼎的人物有点不合适，但您的光临将会让我的女儿兴高采烈。她非常热爱您的诗歌，甚至还给它们谱了曲。”","“If your health will allow,” said the count to the poet, “I shall hope to receive you this evening under my roof; it will be a day to mark, as the old writer said ‘albo notanda lapillo.’Though we cannot duly receive so great a fame in our little house, yet your visit will gratify my daughter, whose admiration for your poems has even led her to set them to music.”"
"“您家中有比名誉更好的东西，”卡那利说，“如果埃内斯特说的是实话，那您就是金屋藏娇了。”","“You have something better than fame in your house,” said Canalis; “you have beauty, if I am to believe Ernest.”"
"“是的，一位好女儿，但您会觉得她十分土气的。”夏尔·米尼翁说。","“Yes, a good daughter; but you will find her rather countrified,” said Charles Mignon."
"“这位乡下姑娘，连埃鲁维尔公爵都紧追不舍呢。”卡那利冷冰冰地说。","“A country girl sought by the Duc d’Herouville,” remarked Canalis, dryly."
"“咳！”米尼翁先生带着南方人狡猾的好脾气回应道，“我让女儿自己做主。公爵也好，亲王也好，普通人也好——对我来说都一样，甚至是天才也是如此。我不会做任何承诺，莫黛斯特选中的人就是我的女婿，或者更确切地说，是我的儿子。”他补充道，同时看了一眼拉布里埃，“有什么办法呢。德拉巴斯蒂夫人是德国人。她从来都不适应我们的礼节，而我也让我家的两个女人牵着鼻子走。我一直都是情愿坐马车，而不愿坐椅子。我目前可以拿这件事开开玩笑，是因为我们还没见到埃鲁维尔公爵，而且我既不相信代办的婚姻，也不相信自己为女儿选丈夫。”","“Oh!” replied Monsieur Mignon, with the perfidious good-humor of a Southerner, “I leave my daughter free.Dukes, princes, commoners,—they are all the same to me, even men of genius.I shall make no pledges, and whoever my Modeste chooses will be my son-inlaw, or rather my son,” he added, looking at La Briere.“It could not be otherwise.Madame de La Bastie is German.She has never adopted our etiquette, and I let my two women lead me their own way.I have always preferred to sit in the carriage rather than on the box.I can make a joke of all this at present, for we have not yet seen the Duc d’Herouville, and I do not believe in marriages arranged by proxy, any more than I believe in choosing my daughter’s husband.”"
"“对于两个正在寻求婚姻幸福的点金石的年轻人来说，您这番声明真是既令人鼓舞又让人沮丧。”卡那利说。","“That declaration is equally encouraging and discouraging to two young men who are searching for the philosopher’s stone of happiness in marriage,” said Canalis."
"“事先说清楚父母、女儿以及求婚者完全行动自由，难道您不觉得这很有用、很有必要，甚至很周全么？”夏尔·米尼翁问道。","“Don’t you consider it useful, necessary, and even politic to stipulate for perfect freedom of action for parents, daughters, and suitors?” asked Charles Mignon."
"卡那利看到拉布里埃的手势，便默不作声了。谈话顿时变得琐碎起来，绕着花园走了几圈后，伯爵便告辞了，并催促两位朋友造访。","Canalis, at a sign from La Briere, kept silence.The conversation presently became unimportant, and after a few turns round the garden the count retired, urging the visit of the two friends."
"“那是要打发我们走，”卡那利叫道，“你跟我一样看得很清楚。也是，尽管我们很有魅力，但如果我处于他的立场，在马厩大总管和我们两人之间我也会毫不犹豫。”","“That’s our dismissal,” cried Canalis; “you saw it as plainly as I did.Well, in his place, I should not hesitate between the grand equerry and either of us, charming as we are.”"
"“我不这么认为，”拉布里埃说。“我相信这位直率的军人前来造访，就是要满足见见你的愿望，还有向我们声明，在他家里接待我们的时候，他会保持中立态度。莫黛斯特爱着你的声誉，又被我的外表所误导，正好处于现实与理想、诗歌与散文之间。不幸的是，我就是那散文。”","“I don’t think so,” said La Briere.“I believe that frank soldier came here to satisfy his desire to see you, and to warn us of his neutrality while receiving us in his house.Modeste, in love with your fame, and misled by my person, stands, as it were, between the real and the ideal, between poetry and prose.I am, unfortunately, the prose.”"
"“热尔曼，”贴身男仆过来撤走咖啡，卡那利对他说道，“半个小时内吩咐好马车。我们要在去木屋之前先溜达溜达。”","“Germain,” said Canalis to the valet, who came to take away the coffee, “order the carriage in half an hour.We will take a drive before we go to the Chalet.”"
"第十八章 闪亮登场","Chapter XVIII A Splendid First Appearance"
"两位年轻人都迫不及待地想见莫黛斯特，但拉布里埃是害怕见面，而卡那利则是带着自命不凡的信心去的。拉布里埃跟莫黛斯特父亲见面时很热情，又炫耀了自己多么注重这位从前的商人的家族自豪感，这让卡那利显得很笨拙。于是，他决定扮演一个特别的角色。这位伟大的诗人决定，一方面装出满不在乎的样子，一方面又一如既往地施展他的迷人魅力，通过表现得对这位少女不屑一顾，来刺激她的自尊心。在美貌的肖利厄公爵夫人的教导下，他向来以对女人了如指掌而闻名，但事实上，他一点儿都不了解女人——尤其是那些对他情有独钟、甘愿为他牺牲的女人。可怜的埃内斯特闷闷不乐地坐在马车角落里，沉浸在真爱造成的恐惧中，并直觉地预见到一位受了伤、被触怒的少女的怒火、蔑视和不屑一顾。与此同时，卡那利像演员为新戏里的重要角色做功课一样，也在默默地准备着，当然，两个男人看上去都不怎么开心。对卡那利而言，这事关重大。过去十年里，他与肖利厄伯爵夫人一直关系密切，可一旦他流露出要结婚的意思，这关系就要破裂了。尽管他用需要休息这个庸俗的借口掩盖了他此行的目的——顺便说一下，女人从来都不相信这样的借口，哪怕是真的——他良心上还是有点过不去。但当诗人说起他良心的不安时，拉布里埃只是耸了耸肩，他觉得“良心”这个词太虚伪了。","The two young men were equally impatient to see Modeste, but La Briere dreaded the interview, while Canalis approached it with the confidence of self-conceit.The eagerness with which La Briere had met the father, and the flattery of his attention to the family pride of the ex-merchant, showed Canalis his own maladroitness, and determined him to select a special role.The great poet resolved to pretend indifference, though all the while displaying his seductive powers; to appear to disdain the young lady, and thus pique her self-love.Trained by the handsome Duchesse de Chaulieu, he was bound to be worthy of his reputation as a man who knew women, when, in fact, he did not know them at all,—which is often the case with those who are the happy victims of an exclusive passion.While poor Ernest, gloomily ensconced in his corner of the caleche, gave way to the terrors of genuine love, and foresaw instinctively the anger, contempt, and disdain of an injured and offended young girl, Canalis was preparing himself, not less silently, like an actor making ready for an important part in a new play; certainly neither of them presented the appearance of a happy man.Important interests were involved for Canalis.The mere suggestion of his desire to marry would bring about a rupture of the tie which had bound him for the last ten years to the Duchesse de Chaulieu.Though he had covered the purpose of his journey with the vulgar pretext of needing rest,—in which, by the bye, women never believe, even when it is true,—his conscience troubled him somewhat; but the word “conscience” seemed so Jesuitical to La Briere that he shrugged his shoulders when the poet mentioned his scruples."
"“你的良心，我的朋友，在我看来无非是害怕失宠于肖利厄夫人之后，会失去虚荣带来的快乐，以及一些实实在在的好处和习惯。如果你确定能成功得到莫黛斯特的话，你会毫不在乎地丢弃那过去八年里在已经割过一次又一次的‘激情之草’里长出来的枯萎了的再生草。如果你只是想说，怕你的保护人知道了你呆在这儿的动机而让她不高兴，那我相信你。要是放弃公爵夫人，而在木屋这边又没成功，这险冒得就太大了吧。你现在忧虑，省得将来后悔。”","“Your conscience, my friend, strikes me as nothing more nor less than a dread of losing the pleasures of vanity, and some very real advantages and habits by sacrificing the affections of Madame de Chaulieu; for, if you were sure of succeeding with Modeste, you would renounce without the slightest compunction the wilted aftermath of a passion that has been mown and well-raked for the last eight years.If you simply mean that you are afraid of displeasing your protectress, should she find out the object of your stay here, I believe you.To renounce the duchess and yet not succeed at the Chalet is too heavy a risk.You take the anxiety of this alternative for remorse.”"
"“你真不懂感情。”诗人烦躁不安地说，就像一个想听恭维的人，得到的却是大实话。","“You have no comprehension of feelings,” said the poet, irritably, like a man who hears truth when he expects a compliment."
"“这应该是一个重婚者跟陪审团说的。”拉布里埃笑着反驳道。","“That is what a bigamist should tell the jury,” retorted La Briere, laughing."
"这句俏皮话又给了卡那利一个不好的印象。他开始觉得拉布里埃太机智也太放肆了，不适合作秘书。","This epigram made another disagreeable impression on Canalis.He began to think La Briere too witty and too free for a secretary."
"车夫穿着卡那利仆人的号衣，驾着一辆华丽的马车到来了。这让木屋的人愈发兴奋，因为大家都在等这两位求婚者。这篇故事中的人物，除了公爵和比查之外，全都聚集在这儿迎接他们。","The arrival of an elegant caleche, driven by a coachman in the Canalis livery, made the more excitement at the Chalet because the two suitors were expected, and all the personages of this history were assembled to receive them, except the duke and Butscha."
"“哪一个是诗人？”拉图奈尔夫人一听到马车声，就站到窗口向迪迈问道。","“Which is the poet?” asked Madame Latournelle of Dumay in the embrasure of a window, where she stationed herself as soon as she heard the wheels."
"“走路像军乐队队长的那个。”中尉答道。","“The one who walks like a drum-major,” answered the lieutenant."
"“啊！”公证人的夫人说道，她端详着卡那利，只见他摇头摆尾，好像知道有人在看着他一样。所有比自己的爱慕者年纪大的女人，都会一直溺爱、奉承他们——那位贵妇人也一样，她不断地奉承、娇惯卡那利，这一错误之举使他在精神上成了一个那喀索斯。当一个女人到了一定年龄，想永远依附于一个男人时，便会开始把他的缺点都奉若神明，以排除所有竞争的可能，因为对手刚开始时都意识不到这种对男人来说已经习以为常的精妙奉承。那些纨绔子弟，如果不是天生如此，那就是这种女性计谋的产物。卡那利年纪轻轻就被漂亮的公爵夫人抓住了，他告诉自己，那位贵妇人的口味就是法律，既然自己的矫揉造作能讨她喜欢，就肯定有其道理。虽然这种性格上的细节极其微妙，但历史学家还是有必要将其指出的。例如，梅尔基奥尔有朗诵的天赋，被世人极力称赞，可过多不明智的溢美之词给了他一种夸张的习惯。不管是诗人还是演员，都不愿抑制这种习惯。因此人们说梅尔基奥尔（通常是借德马尔赛之口）不是在朗诵诗歌，而是在吼叫诗歌，他把音拖得特别长，好让自己听见。用后台的行话来说，卡那利是在“拖腔”。他喜欢跟听众交换眼神，摆出一种自鸣得意的姿势，并使出被演员们称为“荡秋千”的手段——这是对一个搞艺术之人的生动描写。卡那利有自己的模仿者，而事实上，他也成了这一流派的首领。这种吟诵的习惯也稍稍影响了他的谈吐，正如我们在他和迪迈的那次会谈中所见的那样。一个人思想上变得过分做作时，行为也会跟着做作。这位伟大的诗人最后甚至会研究自己的举止，发明不同的姿态，偷偷在镜子里观察自己，让自己的谈吐同随意摆出来的姿势保持一致。他十分注重他想要产生的效果，以至于专门喜欢嘲弄人的布隆代曾有一两次跟人打赌，说他可以随时通过仅仅盯着这位诗人的头发、靴子，或礼服的燕尾，来让他窘迫不堪，结果还真赌赢了。","“Ah!” said the notary’s wife, examining Canalis, who was swinging his body like a man who knows he is being looked at.The fault lay with the great lady who flattered him incessantly and spoiled him,—as all women older than their adorers invariably spoil and flatter them; Canalis in his moral being was a sort of Narcissus.When a woman of a certain age wishes to attach a man forever, she begins by deifying his defects, so as to cut off all possibility of rivalry; for a rival is never, at the first approach, aware of the super-fine flattery to which the man is accustomed.Coxcombs are the product of this feminine manoeuvre, when they are not fops by nature.Canalis, taken young by the handsome duchess, vindicated his affectations to his own mind by telling himself that they pleased that “grande dame,” whose taste was law.Such shades of character may be excessively faint, but it is improper for the historian not to point them out.For instance, Melchior possessed a talent for reading which was greatly admired, and much injudicious praise had given him a habit of exaggeration, which neither poets nor actors are willing to check, and which made people say of him (always through De Marsay) that he no longer declaimed, he bellowed his verses; lengthening the sounds that he might listen to himself.In the slang of the green-room, Canalis “dragged the time.”He was fond of exchanging glances with his hearers, throwing himself into postures of self-complacency and practising those tricks of demeanor which actors call “balancoires,”—the picturesque phrase of an artistic people.Canalis had his imitators, and was in fact the head of a school of his kind.This habit of declamatory chanting slightly affected his conversation, as we have seen in his interview with Dumay.The moment the mind becomes finical the manners follow suit, and the great poet ended by studying his demeanor, inventing attitudes, looking furtively at himself in mirrors, and suiting his discourse to the particular pose which he happened to have taken up.He was so preoccupied with the effect he wished to produce, that a practical joke, Blondet, had bet once or twice, and won the wager, that he could nonplus him at any moment by merely looking fixedly at his hair, or his boots, or the tails of his coats."
"这些姿态和风度开始时对风华正茂的年轻人来说是一种通行证，但现在，由于梅尔基奥尔自己渐渐疲惫了，这一切似乎也就变得陈旧无味了。对于男人和女人来说，上流社会的生活都是令人疲惫的。说不定公爵夫人比她的情人大二十岁这一点，对卡那利的压力要比对她自己的还大，因为在社交界的人们看来，她总是那么漂亮——不施脂粉、没有皱纹，而且冷漠无情。唉！当朴素的芬芳变得淡然无味，当亲切的目光成了演戏般的随声附和，当面部表情从柔情变成多愁善感，当诡计多端的头脑终于无计可施，这些时候，无论是男人或女人，都得不到朋友善意的提醒。只有天才才会像蛇一样自己更新自己，而魅力这个问题和其他问题没什么两样，没有变老的只有心灵而已。有善心的人在各方面都是纯朴的。而现在的卡那利，我们知道，他的心已经枯萎了。他滥用自己动人的眼神，无缘无故地表现出沉思默想时目光凝然的样子。简言之，喝彩对他来说是一桩生意，而他总想从中赚到一笔。他恭维人的方式对肤浅的人来说很迷人，但对其他心思更细腻的人来说，那种俗套的奉承所表现出来的庸俗和厚颜无耻，却是带点侮辱性的。事实上，梅尔基奥尔就像一个弄臣一样满口谎言。德肖利厄公爵作为外交大臣，不得不在议院进行讲话，他的讲话明明平淡无奇，可梅尔基奥尔竟毫不脸红地对他说：“您的才华真是令人赞叹啊！”许多卡那利这样的人，由于碰了一些小钉子，就不再矫揉造作了。","These airs and graces, which started in life with a passport of flowery youth, now seemed all the more stale and old because Melchior himself was waning.Life in the world of fashion is quite as exhausting to men as it is to women, and perhaps the twenty years by which the duchess exceeded her lover’s age, weighed more heavily upon him than upon her; for to the eyes of the world she was always handsome,—without rouge, without wrinkles, and without heart.Alas! neither men nor women have friends who are friendly enough to warn them of the moment when the fragrance of their modesty grows stale, when the caressing glance is but an echo of the stage, when the expression of the face changes from sentiment to sentimentality, and the artifices of the mind show their rusty edges.Genius alone renews its skin like a snake; and in the matter of charm, as in everything else, it is only the heart that never grows old.People who have hearts are simple in all their ways.Now Canalis, as we know, had a shrivelled heart.He misused the beauty of his glance by giving it, without adequate reason, the fixity that comes to the eyes in meditation.In short, applause was to him a business, in which he was perpetually on the lookout for gain.His style of paying compliments, charming to superficial people, seemed insulting to others of more delicacy, by its triteness and the cool assurance of its cut-and-dried flattery.As a matter of fact, Melchior lied like a courtier.He remarked without blushing to the Duc de Chaulieu, who made no impression whatever when he was obliged to address the Chamber as minister of foreign affairs, “Your excellency was truly sublime!”Many men like Canalis are purged of their affectations by the administration of non-success in little doses."
"在圣日耳曼近郊金碧辉煌的沙龙里，每个人都会表现出自己的那一份荒谬，各种夸张的言语和做作的措词——如果你愿意的话，可以称之为夸夸其谈——被极度奢华和富丽堂皇所包围着，从某种程度上来说，周围的环境成了他们的借口，这些缺点也往往被忽视。而在外省，那里的人们有着全然不同的荒谬之处，这些缺点就显得十分明显了。卡那利生来夸夸其谈、矫揉造作，已经无法改变自己的形象了，事实上，公爵夫人将他投进了一个模具里，随着时间的流逝，他已定了型。更何况他还是个十足的巴黎人——或者你也可以说是真正的法国人。巴黎人看到并不是所有地方的所有事物都跟巴黎一样，便感到惊奇；法国人看到并不是所有地方的所有事物都跟法国一样，也感到惊奇。相反，高雅的品味要求我们既能入乡随俗，又不能丢失太多自己的特质——就像绅士典范亚西比德那样。真正的风度是灵活的，它能适应各种不同的境况，它能与所有的社会阶层和谐相处，它在街上穿着简单布料制成的袍子，只在剪裁上引人注意，却比中产阶级那些粗俗的羽毛和荷叶边更显优越。现在，卡那利受到一个爱自己比爱他更多的女人的教唆，到哪里都想制定法律，表现出他认为合适的样子。他以为无论到哪里，他都带着自己的一票观众——这是巴黎某些大人物的通病。","These defects, slight in the gilded salons of the faubourg Saint-Germain, where every one contributes his or her quota of absurdity, and where these particular forms of exaggerated speech and affected diction—magniloquence, if you please to call it so—are surrounded by excessive luxury and sumptuous toilettes, which are to some extent their excuse, were certain to be far more noticed in the provinces, whose own absurdities are of a totally different type.Canalis, by nature over-strained and artificial, could not change his form; in fact, he had had time to grow stiff in the mould into which the duchess had poured him; moreover, he was thoroughly Parisian, or, if you prefer it, truly French.The Parisian is amazed that everything everywhere is not as it in Paris; the Frenchman, as it is in France.Good taste, on the contrary, demands that we adapt ourselves to the customs of foreigners without losing too much of our own character,—as did Alcibiades, that model of a gentleman.True grace is elastic; it lends itself to circumstances; it is in harmony with all social centres; it wears a robe of simple material in the streets, noticeable only by its cut, in preference to the feathers and flounces of middle-class vulgarity.Now Canalis, instigated by a woman who loved herself much more than she loved him, wished to lay down the law and be, everywhere, such as he himself might see fit to be.He believed he carried his own public with him wherever he went,—an error shared by several of the great men of Paris."
"这位诗人按照自己精心设计的模样走进木屋的客厅，成功地给众人留下了深刻的印象，而拉布里埃则像个无足轻重的人，跟在他后面溜了进去。","While the poet made a studied and effective entrance into the salon of the Chalet, La Briere slipped in behind him like a person of no account."
"“哈！这不是我的老兵吗？”卡那利向米尼翁夫人问候了一声，又向其他女士致意，最后看到了迪迈，便这样说道，“您现在不再担心了，对吗？”他热情地伸出手来说，“见了小姐之后，我完全理解了您的担心。我那次跟您说的只是人间的女子，而不是天使。”","“Ha! do I see my soldier?” said Canalis, perceiving Dumay, after addressing a compliment to Madame Mignon, and bowing to the other women.“Your anxieties are relieved, are they not?” he said, offering his hand effusively; “I comprehend them to their fullest extent after seeing mademoiselle.I spoke to you of terrestrial creatures, not of angels.”"
"从所有人的态度上来看，大家都想知道这句话的意思。","All present seemed by their attitudes to ask the meaning of this speech."
"诗人看到每个人都想听他解释解释，就接着说道：“我每次激动地提到那些钢铁般的人时，我都认为这是一次巨大的胜利，独具慧眼的拿破仑发现了这些人，并让他们成了建设其帝国的中流砥柱，可这个帝国太过庞大了，因而没能长久：对于这类建筑物，时间才是水泥。但是，这种胜利——我为什么要引以为豪呢？——我一文不值。这是思想对事实的胜利。我亲爱的迪迈先生，您参加过的那些战斗，伯爵先生，您那些英雄的头衔，不，战争本身就是拿破仑的思想所借助的形式。所有这些事情，还剩下什么呢？掩盖了战争的野草一无所知；庄稼被种下又被收割，却没有说出昔日战场的所在；如果没有历史学家和作家，后世之人就可能对那英雄的时代一无所知。因此，你们十五年的战争现在就只是一些思想而已。使帝国屹立不倒的，是诗人们所作的诗篇。一个能够赢得这些战役的国家，必须知道怎样歌颂它们。”","“I shall always consider it a triumph,” resumed the poet, observing that everybody wished for an explanation, “to have stirred to mention one of those men of iron whom Napoleon had the eye to find and make the supporting piles on which he tried to build an empire, too colossal to be lasting: for such structures time alone is the cement.But this triumph—why should I be proud of it?—I count for nothing.It was the triumph of ideas over facts.Your battles, my dear Monsieur Dumay, your heroic charges, Monsieur le comte, nay, war itself was the form in which Napoleon’s idea clothed itself.Of all of these things, what remains?The sod that covers them knows nothing; harvests come and go without revealing their resting-place; were it not for the historian, the writer, futurity would have no knowledge of those heroic days.Therefore your fifteen years of war are now ideas and nothing more; that which preserves the Empire forever is the poem that the poets make of them.A nation that can win such battles must know how to sing them.”"
"卡那利停了下来，目光扫了一圈，准备接受他所期待的外省人对他的赞叹。","Canalis paused, to gather by a glance that ran round the circle the tribute of amazement which he expected of provincials."
"“您一定感觉到了，先生，我为看不见您而感到遗憾，”米尼翁夫人说，“但您给了我听您讲话的快乐，来弥补我的遗憾。”","“You must be aware, monsieur, of the regret I feel at not seeing you,” said Madame Mignon, “since you compensate me with the pleasure of hearing you.”"
"莫黛斯特决定把卡那利看得很伟大，她一动不动地呆坐着；刺绣从她指尖滑落，只有一根线还留在手指上。","Modeste, determined to think Canalis sublime, sat motionless with amazement; the embroidery slipped from her fingers, which held it only by the needleful of thread."
"“莫黛斯特，这位是埃内斯特·德拉布里埃先生。埃内斯特先生，这是我的女儿。”伯爵觉得这位秘书坐的地方太不显眼了，便说道。","“Modeste, this is Monsieur Ernest de La Briere.Monsieur Ernest, my daughter,” said the count, thinking the secretary too much in the background."
"这位少女冷冷地鞠了一躬，看了埃内斯特一眼，那目光是要向所有在场的人证明，她是第一次见到他。","The young girl bowed coldly, giving Ernest a glance that was meant to prove to every one present that she saw him for the first time."
"“很抱歉，先生，”她的脸并没有红，说道，“我对我们最伟大的诗人的万分钦佩已被我的朋友们看在眼里，这足以作为我只看到了他的理由。”","“Pardon me, monsieur,” she said without blushing; “the great admiration I feel for the greatest of our poets is, in the eyes of my friends, a sufficient excuse for seeing only him.”"
"莫黛斯特的美貌已经使这位秘书深深着迷，而她那纯净清新的嗓音，马尔斯小姐式的腔调，更令这位可怜的秘书眼前一亮。他顿时惊住了，回答了一句话，如果这句话是真的，那便是十分伟大的一句话。","The pure, fresh voice, with accents like that of Mademoiselle Mars, charmed the poor secretary, already dazzled by Modeste’s beauty, and in his sudden surprise he answered by a phrase that would have been sublime, had it been true."
"“他是我的朋友。”他说。","“He is my friend,” he said."
"“啊，那么您是原谅我了。”她回答说。","“Ah, then you do pardon me,” she replied."
"“他不仅仅是我的朋友，”卡那利抓住埃内斯特的肩膀，靠在上面，就像亚历山大靠在俄菲斯提翁肩膀上那样，大声说道，“我们就像亲兄弟一样相亲相爱——”","“He is more than a friend,” cried Canalis taking Ernest by the shoulder and leaning upon it like Alexander on Hephaestion, “we love each other as though we were brothers—”"
"拉图奈尔夫人打断了诗人的话，指着埃内斯特对她丈夫大声说道：“他肯定就是我们在教堂看到的那位绅士。”","Madame Latournelle cut short the poet’s speech by pointing to Ernest and saying aloud to her husband,“Surely that is the gentleman we saw at church.”"
"“可不是吗？”夏尔·米尼翁看到埃内斯特的脸涨红了，赶快说道。","“Why not?” said Charles Mignon, quickly, observing that Ernest reddened."
"莫黛斯特冷冷地拿起她的刺绣。","Modeste coldly took up her embroidery."
"“夫人大概说得没错，我最近到过勒阿弗尔两次。”拉布里埃回答道，说着便坐到迪迈边上。","“Madame may be right; I have been twice in Havre lately,” replied La Briere, sitting down by Dumay."
"卡那利被莫黛斯特的美貌迷住了，误解了她所表达的钦佩之意，并自以为已经成功地达到了他想要的效果。","Canalis, charmed with Modeste’s beauty, mistook the admiration she expressed, and flattered himself he had succeeded in producing his desired effects."
"“如果一个人身边没有忠诚的朋友，那我认为他是个没良心的人。”莫黛斯特接着被拉图奈尔夫人笨拙地打断的话，说道。","“I should think a man without heart, if he had no devoted friend near him,” said Modeste, to pick up the conversation interrupted by Madame Latournelle’s awkwardness."
"“小姐，埃内斯特的忠诚让我几乎可以相信，我还是有价值的，”卡那利说，“因为我这位亲爱的皮拉得斯才华横溢，他曾是和平时期以来我们最伟大的大臣的得力助手。尽管他的地位很高，但还是乐意给我当政治方面的家庭教师。他教我处理政务，用他的经验哺育我，而他本来完全可以追求更好的前程。唉！他比我要强多了。”看到莫黛斯特做了个手势，他便风度翩翩地接着说道：“是的，我所表达的诗意，他都藏在心里，而我之所以在他面前这样开诚布公，那是因为他有着修女般的谦虚。”","“Mademoiselle, Ernest’s devotion makes me almost think myself worth something,” said Canalis; “for my dear Pylades is full of talent; he was the right hand of the greatest minister we have had since the peace.Though he holds a fine position, he is good enough to be my tutor in the science of politics; he teaches me to conduct affairs and feeds me with his experience, when all the while he might aspire to a much better situation.Oh! he is worth far more than I.”At a gesture from Modeste he continued gracefully: “Yes, the poetry that I express he carries in his heart; and if I speak thus openly before him it is because he has the modesty of a nun.”"
"“好了，哎呀，好了！”拉布里埃都不晓得往哪里看好，便大声说道，“我亲爱的卡那利，你让我联想到一个想把自己女儿嫁出去的母亲。”","“Enough, oh, enough!” cried La Briere, who hardly knew which way to look.“My dear Canalis, you remind me of a mother who is seeking to marry off her daughter.”"
"“先生，”夏尔·米尼翁对卡那利说道，“您怎么会想到要成为一位政治家呢？”","“How is it, monsieur,” said Charles Mignon, addressing Canalis, “that you can even think of becoming a political character?”"
"“对于诗人来说，这等于是弃权，”莫黛斯特说，“政治是那些据实之人的出路。”","“It is abdication,” said Modeste, “for a poet; politics are the resource of matter-of-fact men.”"
"“啊，小姐，政治讲坛是当今世界最大的剧场，它已经替代了骑士的比武大会，成为了所有才子的聚集之所，就像军队是勇敢之人的集合地一样。”","“Ah, mademoiselle, the rostrum is today the greatest theatre of the world; it has succeeded the tournaments of chivalry, it is now the meeting-place for all intellects, just as the army has been the rallying-point of courage.”"
"卡那利跨上他的军马策鞭驰骋起来，大谈其政治生活，足足说了十分钟：“诗歌只不过是政治家的开场白。”“如今，演说家已经成了伟大的说理者，思想的牧羊人。”“诗人或许能为国家和个人指路，但他能不做自己吗？”他举了夏多布里昂的例子，并声称此人有一天在政治方面会比在文学方面更加伟大。“法兰西的政治讲坛将成为人类的灯塔。”“口头的战争取代了真正的战场：议院的会议要比任何一场奥斯特利茨战役都有价值，而在众人看来，演说家们跟将军一样崇高，他们像奔赴沙场的战士一样，慷慨地付出生命，付出勇气，付出力量。”“演说当然是一种将人类生命活力发挥到淋漓尽致的途径。”诸如此类的话还有好多好多。","Canalis stuck spurs into his charger and talked for ten minutes on political life:“Poetry was but a preface to the statesman.”“Today the orator has become a sublime reasoner, the shepherd of ideas.”“A poet may point the way to nations or individuals, but can he ever cease to be himself?”He quoted Chateaubriand and declared that he would one day be greater on the political side than on the literary.“The forum of France was to be the pharos of humanity.”“Oral battles supplanted fields of battle: there were sessions of the Chamber finer than any Austerlitz, and orators were seen to be as lofty as generals; they spent their lives, their courage, their strength, as freely as those who went to war.”“Speech was surely one of the most prodigal outlets of the vital fluid that man had ever known,” etc."
"这段即兴演讲无非是关于当下老生常谈的话题，披着堂皇辞藻和新鲜词汇的外衣，其目的是要向人们证明，卡那利男爵有朝一日会成为法国政坛极富盛名的人物。这段演说给公证人、哥本海姆、拉图奈尔夫人和米尼翁夫人留下了很深的印象。莫黛斯特看上去像是在剧院里一样，怀着对演员的热情态度——这跟埃内斯特对她的态度十分相似。尽管所有夸夸其谈的词句这位秘书早已烂熟于胸，但他还是仿佛通过这位少女的双眼倾听着，对她的爱变得越来越疯狂了。对这位真心的爱慕者来说，眼前的莫黛斯特的光芒已经超过了他在读信和回信时想象出来的各种莫黛斯特的形象。","This improvisation of modern commonplaces, clothed in sonorous phrases and newly invented words, and intended to prove that the Comte de Canalis was becoming one of the glories of the French government, made a deep impression upon the notary and Gobenheim, and upon Madame Latournelle and Madame Mignon.Modeste looked as though she were at the theatre, in an attitude of enthusiasm for an actor,—very much like that of Ernest toward herself; for though the secretary knew all these high-sounding phrases by heart, he listened through the eyes, as it were, of the young girl, and grew more and more madly in love with her.To this true lover, Modeste was eclipsing all the Modestes he had created as he read her letters and answered them."
"卡那利已经事先定好了这次拜访的时间长短，他精打细算，不给他的爱慕们任何腻烦的可能。拜访结束时，他们被邀请下个星期一来进晚餐。","This visit, the length of which was predetermined by Canalis, careful not to allow his admirers a chance to get surfeited, ended by an invitation to dinner on the following Monday."
"“到时候我们就不会在木屋了，”德拉巴斯蒂伯爵说，“这里将会是迪迈的个人住所了。我要搬回公馆去。今天，我已经同维尔坎先生签订了为期六个月的赎回合同。”","“We shall not be at the Chalet,” said the Comte de La Bastie.“Dumay will have sole possession of it.I return to the villa, having bought it back under a deed of redemption within six months, which I have today signed with Monsieur Vilquin.”"
"“我希望，”迪迈说，“维尔坎不能偿还你刚刚借给他的钱，那样公馆就一直是你的了。”","“I hope,” said Dumay, “that Vilquin will not be able to return to you the sum you have just lent him, and that the villa will remain yours.”"
"“那所住宅才能与您的财富相称。”卡那利说。","“It is an abode in keeping with your fortune,” said Canalis."
"“您指的是别人口中我的财富吧。”夏尔·米尼翁马上说道。","“You mean the fortune that I am supposed to have,” replied Charles Mignon, hastily."
"“这位圣母玛利亚，”卡那利转向莫黛斯特，充满魅力地微微鞠躬，说道，“如果没有一个与她天仙般的完美相称的环境，那真是太可惜了。”","“It would be too sad,” said Canalis, turning to Modeste with a charming little bow, “if this Madonna were not framed in a manner worthy of her divine perfections.”"
"卡那利对莫黛斯特只说了这一句话。他假装不看她，表现得像一个根本不想结婚的人。","That was the only thing Canalis said to Modeste.He affected not to look at her, and behaved like a man to whom all idea of marriage was interdicted."
"“啊！我亲爱的米尼翁夫人，”等到这两位巴黎人将小径上的沙砾踩得沙沙作响时，公证人的老婆就大声说道，“他真是个才子！”","“Ah! my dear Madame Mignon,” cried the notary’s wife, as soon as the gravel was heard to grit under the feet of the Parisians, “what an intellect!”"
"“他有钱吗？——这才是问题的关键。”哥本海姆说。","“Is he rich?—that is the question,” said Gobenheim."
"莫黛斯特站在窗边，不放过伟大诗人的每一个动作，对他的同伴却视若无睹。等米尼翁先生回到客厅，马车转弯时，两位朋友向莫黛斯特鞠了最后一躬。莫黛斯特随后回到她的座位上，这时，一场重大的讨论便开始了，外省人第一次见到某个巴黎人之后，总要进行一番这样的讨论。哥本海姆反复说着那句“他有钱吗？”，以此来附和拉图奈尔夫人、莫黛斯特和她母亲所唱的赞歌。","Modeste was at the window, not losing a single movement of the great poet, and paying no attention to his companion.When Monsieur Mignon returned to the salon, and Modeste, having received a last bow from the two friends as the carriage turned, went back to her seat, a weighty discussion took place, such as provincials invariably hold over Parisians after a first interview.Gobenheim repeated his phrase, “Is he rich?” as a chorus to the songs of praise sung by Madame Latournelle, Modeste, and her mother."
"“有钱！”莫黛斯特大声说，“有钱算什么！难道你没看出来吗？德卡那利先生注定要担任国家的重要职位。他有的不仅仅是财富，他还有获得财富的手段。”","“Rich!” exclaimed Modeste; “what can that signify!Do you not see that Monsieur de Canalis is one of those men who are destined for the highest places in the State.He has more than fortune; he possesses that which gives fortune.”"
"“他将来会成为内阁大臣或大使。”米尼翁先生说。","“He will be minister or ambassador,” said Monsieur Mignon."
"“可他葬礼的费用还是得由纳税人来出。”公证人评论道。","“That won’t hinder tax-payers from having to pay the costs of his funeral,” remarked the notary."
"“此话怎讲？”夏尔·米尼翁问道。","“How so?” asked Charles Mignon."
"“我感觉他是一个会挥霍掉所有财富的人，连同莫黛斯特小姐如此大方地赠与他的天才一起挥霍掉。”拉图奈尔回答说。","“He strikes me as a man who will waste all the fortunes with whose gifts Mademoiselle Modeste so liberally endows him,” answered Latournelle."
"“对于一位管她叫圣母玛利亚的诗人，莫黛斯特不能不大方呀。”迪迈嘲笑道，他仍保留着起初对卡那利的反感。","“Modeste can’t avoid being liberal to a poet who called her a Madonna,” said Dumay, sneering, and faithful to the repulsion with which Canalis had originally inspired him."
"哥本海姆以前所未有的坚持精神摆好了惠斯特牌桌，因为自从米尼翁先生回来之后，拉图奈尔和迪迈就开始大手大脚地每次下十个苏的赌注。","Gobenheim arranged the whist-table with all the more persistency because, since the return of Monsieur Mignon, Latournelle and Dumay had allowed themselves to play for ten sous points."
"“喂，我的小宝贝，”父亲对呆在窗户边的女儿说道，“承认爸爸考虑周到了吧。如果你今天晚上就给你从前的巴黎裁缝还有其他首饰商下订单，一个星期后就会以女继承人光彩夺目的姿态出现了。在此期间，我们会到公馆里安顿下来。你已经有了一匹漂亮的马，现在再去订一套骑装吧，这是对马厩大总管应有的礼貌。”","“Well, my little darling,” said the father to the daughter in the embrasure of a window.“Admit that papa thinks of everything.If you send your orders this evening to your former dressmaker in Paris, and all your other furnishing people, you shall show yourself eight days hence in all the splendor of an heiress.Meantime we will install ourselves in the villa.You already have a pretty horse, now order a habit; you owe that amount of civility to the grand equerry.”"
"“还因为我们有许多人要去骑马。”莫黛斯特说道，她已经恢复了健康的气色。","“All the more because there will be a number of us to ride,” said Modeste, who was recovering the colors of health."
"“那个秘书话不多。”米尼翁夫人评论说。","“The secretary did not say much,” remarked Madame Mignon."
"“一个小笨蛋，”拉图奈尔夫人说，“诗人在谈话时则照顾到了每个人。他感谢拉图奈尔先生帮他租房子，还说，拉图奈尔一定是咨询了一位很有品位的女人。可另外一个呢，看上去像西班牙人那样闷闷不乐，而且双眼紧盯着莫黛斯特，像是要把她整个儿吞下去似的。要是他那样看我，我非害怕不可。”","“A little fool,” said Madame Latournelle; “the poet has an attentive word for everybody.He thanked Monsieur Latournelle for his help in choosing the house; and said he must have taken counsel with a woman of good taste.But the other looked as gloomy as a Spaniard, and kept his eyes fixed on Modeste as though he would like to swallow her whole.If he had even looked at me I should have been afraid of him.”"
"“他的声音挺好听。”米尼翁夫人说。","“He had a pleasant voice,” said Madame Mignon."
"“毫无疑问，他之前来勒阿弗尔是为他的诗人朋友打听米尼翁家族的情况。”莫黛斯特边说边悄悄看着她父亲，“他肯定是我们在教堂里见过的那个人。”","“No doubt he came to Havre to inquire about the Mignons in the interests of his friend the poet,” said Modeste, looking furtively at her father.“It was certainly he whom we saw in church.”"
"迪迈夫人、迪迈先生，以及拉图奈尔夫人，都同意对埃内斯特之行的这一自然解释。","Madame Dumay and Monsieur and Madame Latournelle, accepted this as the natural explanation of Ernest’s journey."
"第十九章 一笔好交易","Chapter XIX Of Which the Author Thinks a Good Deal"
"“你知道吗，埃内斯特，”两人离开木屋一小段距离后，卡那利就大叫道，“我在巴黎的上流社会里见到的适婚女子，没有一个能同那位可爱的少女相比。”","“Do you know, Ernest,” cried Canalis, when they had driven a short distance from the house, “I don’t see any marriageable woman in society in Paris who compares with that adorable girl.”"
"“啊，那完了！”埃内斯特回答说，“她爱你，或者说，如果你想的话，她将会爱上你。在这场战争中，你的名气就打赢了一半。好吧，你现在就可以按你自己的方式来打胜仗了。你以后可以一个人去那儿了。莫黛斯特看不起我，她这样做是对的，而我找不到任何理由让自己遭罪，去观望、赞美、向往、爱慕我永远都不能拥有的东西。”","“Ah, that ends it!” replied Ernest.“She loves you, or she will love you if you desire it.Your fame won half the battle.Well, you may now have it all your own way.You shall go there alone in future.Modeste despises me; she is right to do so; and I don’t see any reason why I should condemn myself to see, to love, desire, and adore that which I can never possess.”"
"卡那利说了几句安慰的话，话里掺杂着借用凯撒大帝名言带来的自我满足感，之后便透露他想跟德肖利厄公爵夫人断绝关系。拉布里埃完全无法将谈话继续下去，以欣赏美丽的夜景为借口下了车，像着了魔似的跑去了海边，在那里一直呆到十点多。他半疯半癫地快步走来走去，前言不搭后语地大声说话，有时候又傻站着或呆坐着，都没有注意到值班的两名海关人员的不安。他之前爱的是莫黛斯特的机智、才华，以及她那咄咄逼人的率直，现在，又在十天前将他带到勒阿弗尔教堂的全部理由之上，加上了对莫黛斯特美貌的爱慕——也就是毫无理由、无法解释的爱。","After a few consoling remarks, dashed with his own satisfaction at having made a new version of Caesar’s phrase, Canalis divulged a desire to break with the Duchesse de Chaulieu.La Briere, totally unable to keep up the conversation, made the beauty of the night an excuse to be set down, and then rushed like one possessed to the seashore, where he stayed till past ten, in a half-demented state, walking hurriedly up and down, talking aloud in broken sentences, sometimes standing still or sitting down, without noticing the uneasiness of two custom-house officers who were on the watch.After loving Modeste’s wit and intellect and her aggressive frankness, he now joined adoration of her beauty—that is to say, love without reason, love inexplicable—to all the other reasons which had drawn him ten days earlier, to the church in Havre."
"他回到了木屋，两条比利牛斯狗朝他狂吠，他不得不放弃了凝望莫黛斯特窗户的快乐。在爱情上，这类事情之于一个情人，并不比作品的最后一层色彩之于一位画家的意义更大。然而，正是这些举动构成了爱情的全部，就像看不见的艰辛构成了艺术的全部。正是从这些艰辛之中，产生了伟大的画家和真正的情人，女人和公众最终会爱慕他们，但有时候为时已晚。","He returned to the Chalet, where the Pyrenees hounds barked at him till he was forced to relinquish the pleasure of gazing at Modeste’s windows.In love, such things are of no more account to the lover than the work which is covered by the last layer of color is to an artist; yet they make up the whole of love, just as the hidden toil is the whole of art.Out of them arise the great painter and the true lover whom the woman and the public end, sometimes too late, by adoring."
"“好吧！”他大声叫道，“我要留下，我要忍受折磨，我要只为自己而爱她，默默地爱着她。莫黛斯特将会是我的太阳，我的生命，我会借她的气息而呼吸，以她的快乐为快乐，以她的痛苦为痛苦，哪怕她成了那个自我主义者卡那利的妻子。”","“Well then!” he cried aloud, “I will stay, I will suffer, I will love her for myself only, in solitude.Modeste shall be my sun, my life; I will breathe with her breath, rejoice in her joys and bear her griefs, be she even the wife of that egoist, Canalis.”"
"“这才是我所说的一往情深，先生，”路边的灌木丛里发出了一个声音，“哈哈，怎么全世界的人都爱上了德拉巴斯蒂小姐呢？”","“That’s what I call loving, monsieur,” said a voice which came from a shrub by the side of the road.“Ha, ha, so all the world is in love with Mademoiselle de La Bastie?”"
"接着，比查突然出现了，看着拉布里埃。借着月光，拉布里埃看到了这个小矮子，他遏制住自己的怒火，向前走了几步，没有回答。","And Butscha suddenly appeared and looked at La Briere.La Briere checked his anger when, by the light of the moon, he saw the dwarf, and he made a few steps without replying."
"“在一个连队作战的士兵，应该成为好战友，”比查说道，“您不喜欢卡那利，我也不喜欢他。”","“Soldiers who serve in the same company ought to be good comrades,” remarked Butscha.“You don’t love Canalis; neither do I.”"
"“他是我的朋友。”埃内斯特回答说。","“He is my friend,” replied Ernest."
"“哈，您就是那个小秘书？”","“Ha, you are the little secretary?”"
"“您要明白，先生，我不是任何人的秘书。我很荣幸在国家最高法院做法律顾问。”","“You are to know, monsieur, that I am no man’s secretary.I have the honor to be of counsel to a supreme court of this kingdom.”"
"“我很荣幸向德拉布里埃先生致意，”比查说，“我本人很荣幸成为勒阿弗尔首席顾问拉图奈尔的首席文书，而我的地位要比您有优势。是的，我很高兴在过去四年里，几乎每天晚上都能见到德拉巴斯蒂小姐，而且我将来还会像国王的奴仆住在杜伊勒利宫一样，住在她的附近。即使有人将俄国的王位送给我，我也会这样回答：‘我太爱阳光了。’先生，难道这不是在告诉您，我对她的关切超过了对我自己的关切吗？我正带着最光荣的目的关注着她的幸福。德肖利厄公爵夫人的侍女爱上了热尔曼先生，她不高兴那位迷人的贴身男仆外出呆在勒阿弗尔，如果她在给女主人梳头的时候说起这些，您认为那傲慢的公爵夫人会向德卡那利夫人的幸福投来友好的目光吗——”","“I have the honor to salute Monsieur de La Briere,” said Butscha.“I myself have the honor to be head clerk to Latournelle, chief councillor of Havre, and my position is a better one than yours.Yes, I have had the happiness of seeing Mademoiselle Modeste de La Bastie nearly every evening for the last four years, and I expect to live near her, as a king’s servant lives in the Tuileries.If they offered me the throne of Russia I should answer, ‘I love the sun too well.’Isn’t that telling you, monsieur, that I care more for her than for myself?I am looking after her interests with the most honorable intentions.Do you believe that the proud Duchesse de Chaulieu would cast a favorable eye on the happiness of Madame de Canalis if her waiting-woman, who is in love with Monsieur Germain, not liking that charming valet’s absence in Havre, were to say to her mistress while brushing her hair—”"
"“您是从谁那儿知道这一切的？”拉布里埃打断比查，说道。","“Who do you know about all this?” said La Briere, interrupting Butscha."
"“我本来只是公证人的文书，”比查答道，“但是，难道您没看见我的驼背吗？它里面满是才智，先生。我成了菲洛塞娜·雅克曼小姐的表哥，这位小姐出生于翁弗勒尔，而我母亲也出生在那儿，也姓雅克曼——在翁弗勒尔，雅克曼家族有八个分支。于是，我的表妹就在一笔极为不可信的财富的诱惑下，告诉了我许多事情。”","“In the first place, I am clerk to a notary,” answered Butscha.“But haven’t you seen my hump?It is full of resources, monsieur.I have made myself cousin to Mademoiselle Philoxene Jacmin, born at Honfleur, where my mother was born, a Jacmin,—there are eight branches of the Jacmins at Honfleur.So my cousin Philoxene, enticed by the bait of a highly improbable fortune, has told me a good many things.”"
"“公爵夫人有报复心？”拉布里埃说。","“The duchess is vindictive?” said La Briere."
"“菲洛塞娜跟我说，她的报复心像皇后一样强。公爵只是她名义上的丈夫而已，对此，她从来都没原谅过公爵。”比查回答说，“她敢爱敢恨。她的性格、她的口味、她的穿着、她的信仰、还有她的行为习惯，所有这些我都了解，因为菲洛塞娜把她的内心和外表都剖析给我看了。我还专程去剧院看了她，而且一点儿都不后悔花了十法郎——我不是说那戏剧好看。要不是我那所谓的表妹告诉我公爵夫人已经五十岁了，我还真以为她顶多三十岁。那位公爵夫人，她可一点儿不显老！”","“Vindictive as a queen, Philoxene says; she has never yet forgiven the duke for being nothing more than her husband,” replied Butscha.“She hates as she loves.I know all about her character, her tastes, her toilette, her religion, and her manners; for Philoxene stripped her for me, soul and corset.I went to the opera expressly to see her, and I didn’t grudge the ten francs it cost me—I don’t mean the play.If my imaginary cousin had not told me the duchess had seen her fifty summers, I should have thought I was over-generous in giving her thirty; she has never known a winter, that duchess!”"
"“是的，”拉布里埃说，“她是一块浮雕宝石——因为是石头，所以保存完好。要是公爵夫人发现卡那利在这儿做什么，那卡那利就惨了。而且先生，我希望您这番侦查工作就此打住，这不是一个诚实的人应该做的。”","“Yes,” said La Briere, “she is a cameo—preserved because it is stone.Canalis would be in a bad way if the duchess were to find out what he is doing here; and I hope, monsieur, that you will go no further in this business of spying, which is unworthy of an honest man.”"
"“先生，”比查自豪地说，“对我而言，莫黛斯特就是我的国家。我没有侦查，我只是预见，我是在做预防措施。公爵夫人会在适当的时候出现在这里，要不然她就会安静地呆在她现在的地方，这都要根据我的判断。”","“Monsieur,” said Butscha, proudly; “for me Modeste is my country.I do not spy; I foresee, I take precautions.The duchess will come here if it is desirable, or she will stay tranquilly where she is, according to what I judge best.”"
"“您？”","“You?”"
"“我。”","“I.”"
"“那怎么做呢，请问？”","“And how, pray?”"
"“哈，就是这样！”这个小驼子拔起一根草，说道，“看这里！这株草以为人们建造了宫殿给它住，它挤在间隔最窄的大理石块中间生长，并把石块掀翻，就像大量民众拥进封建的大厦里将其掀翻一样。微小生命的力量可以潜入任何地方，这种力量要比大炮背后的强大势力厉害得多。我是发誓要让莫黛斯特幸福、并为她而出卖自己荣誉的三个仆人之一。再见，先生。如果您真的爱德拉巴斯蒂小姐，请忘掉这次谈话，并同我握握手，因为我觉得您是有良心的。我迫不及待地要来木屋看看，我到这里时，她刚好熄灯。我看见狗对您吼叫，又听到了您说的话，这就是为什么我冒昧地说我们是在同一团队里作战——忠诚之团。”","“Ha, that’s it!” said the little hunchback, plucking a blade of grass.“See here! this herb believes that men build palaces for it to grow in; it wedges its way between the closest blocks of marble, and brings them down, just as the masses forced into the edifice of feudality have brought it to the ground.The power of the feeble life that can creep everywhere is greater than that of the mighty behind their cannons.I am one of three who have sworn that Modeste shall be happy, and we would sell our honor for her.Adieu, monsieur.If you truly love Mademoiselle de La Bastie, forget this conversation and shake hands with me, for I think you’ve got a heart.I longed to see the Chalet, and I got here just as SHE was putting out her light.I saw the dogs rush at you, and I overheard your words, and that is why I take the liberty of saying we serve in the same regiment—that of loyal devotion.”"
"“先生，”拉布里埃握着驼子的手说，“您能不能行行好，告诉我莫黛斯特小姐在写信给卡那利之前，有没有真心爱过什么人？”","“Monsieur,” said La Briere, wringing the hunchback’s hand, “would you have the friendliness to tell me if Mademoiselle Modeste ever loved any one WITH LOVE before she wrote to Canalis?”"
"“哎呀！”比查的声音变了，惊呼道，“这种想法是一种侮辱。就算是现在，又有谁知道她是否真的爱谁呢？她了解自己吗？她迷恋天才，迷恋那个贩卖诗歌的商人，迷恋那个文学江湖骗子的心灵和才智。不过，她会考察他的，我们都会考察他，而且我知道怎样让一个人的真正性格从堂皇的行为举止的龟壳下显露出来——我们很快就会看到他那野心勃勃、自大虚荣的小脑袋了！”比查搓着手，大声说道，“所以，除非是小姐对他迷恋得要死——”","“Oh!” exclaimed Butscha in an altered voice; “that thought is an insult.And even now, who knows if she really loves? does she know herself?She is enamored of genius, of the soul and intellect of that seller of verses, that literary quack; but she will study him, we shall all study him; and I know how to make the man’s real character peep out from under that turtle-shell of fine manners,—we’ll soon see the petty little head of his ambition and his vanity!” cried Butscha, rubbing his hands.“So, unless mademoiselle is desperately taken with him—”"
"“唉！小姐看见他时，就满心爱慕，好像他是什么不可思议的东西似的。”拉布里埃叫道，流露出他内心的嫉妒。","“Oh! she was seized with admiration when she saw him, as if he were something marvellous,” exclaimed La Briere, letting the secret of his jealousy escape him."
"“如果他是一个忠诚、正直的小伙子，而且爱小姐，如果他真配得上小姐，如果他宣布放弃他的公爵夫人，”比查说——“那我会想办法对付公爵夫人！嘿，我亲爱的先生，沿这条路走，您十分钟就能到家。”","“If he is a loyal, honest fellow, and loves her; if he is worthy of her; if he renounces his duchess,” said Butscha,—“then I’ll manage the duchess!Here, my dear sir, take this road, and you will get home in ten minutes.”"
"但是，他们一分开，比查就又转过身叫住了可怜的埃内斯特。埃内斯特是个真正的钟情之人，就是让他呆在那儿一整晚谈论莫黛斯特，他也很乐意。","But as they parted, Butscha turned back and hailed poor Ernest, who, as a true lover, would gladly have stayed there all night talking of Modeste."
"“先生，”比查说，“我还未曾有幸见到我们伟大的诗人。我很好奇，想观察一下那个了不起的家伙大显身手时的样子。帮我个忙，明天晚上带他来木屋，并尽可能呆得久一点儿，因为要让一个人露出本来面目，一个多小时可不够。我会第一个看出他是不是爱莫黛斯特小姐，能不能爱莫黛斯特小姐，或者究竟会不会爱莫黛斯特小姐。”","“Monsieur,” said Butscha, “I have not yet had the honor of seeing our great poet.I am very curious to observe that magnificent phenomenon in the exercise of his functions.Do me the favor to bring him to the Chalet tomorrow evening, and stay as long as possible; for it takes more than an hour for a man to show himself for what he is.I shall be the first to see if he loves, if he can love, or if he ever will love Mademoiselle Modeste.”"
"“您太年轻了，不能——”","“You are very young to—”"
"“——当专家，”比查直接打断拉布里埃，“哈，先生，畸形儿生下来就有一百岁。另外，一个长期生病的病人，知道的东西比医生都要多，他了解疾病，而就连最好的医生也未必懂得。那么，当一个男人从内心珍爱着一个女人，而女人却因为他的丑陋或畸形而看不起他，情况也会如此。他最后会十分懂得爱情，变得魅力非凡，就像病人恢复健康一样。只有蠢才才无可救药。我从六岁开始就无父无母，现在已经二十五岁了。公共慈善机构是我的母亲，国王代理官就是我的父亲。唉哟！别担心，”看到埃内斯特的手势，他补充道，“尽管处境尴尬，可我还是活得风生水起。唔，自从六年前一个女人的眼神第一次告诉我，说我没权利去爱，我就爱上了女人，并且研究女人。我从长相丑陋的开始，因为解决问题要从关键入手嘛。于是我研究了主人的妻子，当然，对于我的第一次研究来说，她简直是个天使。也许我不该这样做，但我是情不自禁的。我让她经过我的蒸馏器，你猜我发现了什么？那是一个埋藏在她心底的想法：‘我并没有他们想象得那么丑陋’。虽然她很虔诚，但如果一个男人利用这个想法，也有可能将她带到深渊边上。”","“—to be a professor,” said Butscha, cutting short La Briere.“Ha, monsieur, deformed folks are born a hundred years old.And besides, a sick man who has long been sick, knows more than his doctor; he knows the disease, and that is more than can be said for the best of doctors.Well, so it is with a man who cherishes a woman in his heart when the woman is forced to disdain him for his ugliness or his deformity; he ends by knowing so much of love that he becomes seductive, just as the sick man recovers his health; stupidity alone is incurable.I have had neither father nor mother since I was six years old; I am now twenty-five.Public charity has been my mother, the procureur du roi my father.Oh! don’t be troubled,” he added, seeing Ernest’s gesture; “I am much more lively than my situation.Well, for the last six years, ever since a woman’s eye first told me I had no right to love, I do love, and I study women.I began with the ugly ones, for it is best to take the bull by the horns.So I took my master’s wife, who has certainly been an angel to me, for my first study.Perhaps I did wrong; but I couldn’t help it.I passed her through my alembic and what did I find? this thought, crouching at the bottom of her heart, ‘I am not so ugly as they think me’; and if a man were to work upon that thought he could bring her to the edge of the abyss, pious as she is.”"
"“那你研究过莫黛斯特吗？”","“And have you studied Modeste?”"
"“我想我已经告诉过你了，”比查回答说，“我的生命属于她，就像法兰西属于国王一样。您现在明白了您所谓的我在巴黎的侦查吗？除了我，没有人能真正了解在这个可爱人儿的内心和灵魂深处，有着怎样的高贵，怎样的骄傲，怎样的忠诚，怎样的神秘魅力，怎样亘古不变的善良，怎样真实的信仰、欢乐、才智、细腻、学识以及谦恭有礼！”","“I thought I told you,” replied Butscha, “that my life belongs to her, just as France belongs to the king.Do you now understand what you called my spying in Paris?No one but me really knows what nobility, what pride, what devotion, what mysterious grace, what unwearying kindness, what true religion, gaiety, wit, delicacy, knowledge, and courtesy there are in the soul and in the heart of that adorable creature!”"
"比查掏出手帕擦了擦眼睛，而拉布里埃则久久地握住他的手。","Butscha drew out his handkerchief and wiped his eyes, and La Briere pressed his hand for a long time."
"“我活在她生命的阳光下，那阳光来自她身上，被我吸收，我们就这样被联系在一起——就像大自然通过光和语言，与上帝连在一起一样。再见了，先生，我有生以来从未这样说过话，但看到您站在她的窗下，我从心底感觉到您就像我一样爱着她。”","“I live in the sunbeam of her existence; it comes from her, it is absorbed in me; that is how we are united,—as nature is to God, by the Light and by the Word.Adieu, monsieur; never in my life have I talked in this way; but seeing you beneath her windows, I felt in my heart that you loved her as I love her.”"
"没等这位可怜的情人回答，比查就离开了他。比查的话在他的心头贴上了一剂难以言喻的止痛膏。埃内斯特决定同他交个朋友，并未怀疑这位文书跟自己费口舌的主要目的，是不是为了跟某个与卡那利有关的人通通气。埃内斯特当天晚上思潮汹涌，为以后的行动下着决心，做着计划，翻来覆去好不容易才睡着。而卡那利则睡着征服者的安稳觉，那是除了正直之人的安稳觉之外最甜美的睡眠。","Without waiting for an answer Butscha quitted the poor lover, into whose heart his words had put an inexpressible balm.Ernest resolved to make a friend of him, not suspecting that the chief object of the clerk’s loquacity was to gain communication with some one connected with Canalis.Ernest was rocked to sleep that night by the ebb and flow of thoughts and resolutions and plans for his future conduct, whereas Canalis slept the sleep of the conqueror, which is the sweetest of slumbers after that of the just."
"第二天早餐时，两个朋友达成协议第二天晚上去木屋，并决定尝尝玩外省惠斯特牌的乐趣。为了打发白天的时间，他们吩咐备好热尔曼花高价买来的马，开始环游这片对他们来说就像中国那样陌生的乡村，以期有所发现，因为对法兰西的法国人来说，最陌生的恰恰是法兰西本身。","At breakfast next morning, the friends agreed to spend the evening of the following day at the Chalet and initiate themselves into the delights of provincial whist.To get rid of the day they ordered their horses, purchased by Germain at a large price, and started on a voyage of discovery round the country, which was quite as unknown to them as China; for the most foreign thing to Frenchmen in France is France itself."
"考虑到自己现在是个倒霉的、遭人鄙视的情人，埃内斯特进行了一些思考，跟莫黛斯特的第一封信给他带来的思考过程有些类似。尽管说伤痛会助长美德，但这也只能在有美德的人身上发生。那种良心的大扫除，只有天性纯洁的人才会去做。拉布里埃发誓要以斯巴达人的沉默来忍受他的痛苦，要行为正当，不做卑鄙之事；而卡那利则为那笔丰厚的嫁妆所着迷，他告诉自己，要利用一切手段将那位女嗣给迷住。自私自利和正直忠诚，正是这两种性格各自的主基调。因此，在效果往往十分奇特的道德法则的作用下，两人分别采取了与他们各自本性相反的手段。自私自利的人披上了自我克制的外衣；总是替他人着想的人反而到傲慢的阿文丁山上避难去了。这种现象在政治生活中经常见到。人们总是表里不一，而公众有时则不能辨别哪面是真、哪面是假。","By dint of reflecting on his position as an unfortunate and despised lover, Ernest went through something of the same process as Modeste’s first letter had forced upon him.Though sorrow is said to develop virtue, it only develops it in virtuous persons; that cleaning-out of the conscience takes place only in persons who are by nature clean.La Briere vowed to endure his sufferings in Spartan silence, to act worthily, and give way to no baseness; while Canalis, fascinated by the enormous “dot,” was telling himself to take every means of captivating the heiress.Selfishness and devotion, the key-notes of the two characters, therefore took, by the action of a moral law which is often very odd in its effects, certain measures that were contrary to their respective natures.The selfish man put on self-abnegation; the man who thought chiefly of others took refuge on the Aventinus of pride.That phenomenon is often seen in political life.Men frequently turn their characters wrong side out, and it sometimes happens that the public is unable to tell which is the right side."
"晚饭后，两个朋友听到了马厩大总管到达的消息。当天晚上，他便由拉图奈尔引见到木屋。有一次，德埃鲁维尔小姐故意派一个男仆去请公证人见她，而不直接派她的侄子去，这件事伤到了可敬的公证人。这次特别的造访本来会让公证人在有生之年念念不忘，可这么一来，他就根本没去。所以，当马厩大总管提出驾马车带他去木屋时，拉图奈尔简慢地说，他要先去接他夫人。看到这个小个子愠怒的样子，公爵猜到是有某个错误需要自己弥补，便彬彬有礼地说道：","After dinner the two friends heard of the arrival of the grand equerry, who was presented at the Chalet the same evening by Latournelle.Mademoiselle d’Herouville had contrived to wound that worthy man by sending a footmen to tell him to come to her, instead of sending her nephew in person; thus depriving the notary of a distinguished visit he would certainly have talked about for the rest of his natural life.So Latournelle curtly informed the grand equerry, when he proposed to drive him to the Chalet, that he was engaged to take Madame Latournelle.Guessing from the little man’s sulky manner that there was some blunder to repair, the duke said graciously:—"
"“如果您允许，我会很高兴和您一起去接拉图奈尔夫人。”","“Then I shall have the pleasure, if you will allow me, of taking Madame Latournelle also.”"
"德埃鲁维尔小姐傲慢地耸了耸肩，但公爵没管她，跟着公证人离开了房间。拉图奈尔夫人看到这辆华丽的马车停在家门口，看到男仆穿着皇室的号衣，放下踏板，高兴得都快疯了。听说马厩大总管是来接她的，她激动得连自己的手套和阳伞都找不到了，平日里滑稽的言行、神奇的派头，也都消失不见了。然而，一上马车，她一面有些疑惑地向小个子公爵表示谢意和寒暄，一面又突然从她善良的内心里闪出了一个念头，说道：","Disregarding Mademoiselle d’Herouville’s haughty shrug, the duke left the room with the notary.Madame Latournelle, half-crazed with joy at seeing the gorgeous carriage at her door, with footmen in royal livery letting down the steps, was too agitated on hearing that the grand equerry had called for her, to find her gloves, her parasol, her absurdity, or her usual air of pompous dignity.Once in the carriage, however, and while expressing confused thanks and civilities to the little duke, she suddenly exclaimed, from a thought in her kind heart,—"
"“咦，比查呢，他在哪儿？”","“But Butscha, where is he?”"
"“我们也带上比查吧。”公爵笑着说。","“Let us take Butscha,” said the duke, smiling."
"码头上的人被这华丽的贵族马车吸引，成群结队地围了过来。他们看到三个小个子男人同一个干瘦、高大的女人坐在一起这滑稽的场面，便你看我我看你，大笑起来。","When the people on the quays, attracted in groups by the splendor of the royal equipage, saw the funny spectacle, the three little men with the spare gigantic woman, they looked at one another and laughed."
"“把那三个焊在一起，就能组成一个同那条大鳕鱼相配的男人了。”一个波尔多水手说。","“If you melt all three together, they might make one man fit to mate with that big cod-fish,” said a sailor from Bordeaux."
"“您还有什么东西要带的吗，夫人？”公爵半开玩笑地问道。这时，男仆正在等待出发的命令。","“Is there any other thing you would like to take with you, madame?” asked the duke, jestingly, while the footman awaited his orders."
"“没有了，大人。”她满脸通红地回答。她望了望丈夫，好像是在问：“我做错什么了？”","“No, monseigneur,” she replied, turning scarlet and looking at her husband as much as to say, “What did I do wrong?”"
"“公爵先生把我当成了东西，这已经是我的荣幸了，”比查说，“一个穷文书通常连东西都算不上。”","“Monsieur le duc honors me by considering that I am a thing,” said Butscha; “a poor clerk is usually thought to be a nonentity.”"
"虽然文书是笑着说这话的，但公爵还是涨红了脸，没有回答。大人物跟比他们社会地位低的人开玩笑是要受指责的。玩笑是一种游戏，而游戏就预设了平等。为了防止这种短暂平等引起的不便，游戏者在游戏结束之后，有权装作互不相识。","Though this was said with a laugh, the duke colored and did not answer.Great people are to blame for joking with their social inferiors.Jesting is a game, and games presuppose equality; it is to obviate any inconvenient results of this temporary equality that players have the right, after the game is over, not to recognize each other."
"马厩大总管这次造访的借口是他要来谈一件大事，也就是如何开发利用两条河的河口同海岸之间的一大块空地，这块空地国务院刚刚批给埃鲁维尔家族的。事情有点麻烦，涉及到筑防洪堤，在堤上建双电桥，还要排干三四百英亩的泥沙，挖渠沟，铺车道。公爵解释完这块地的状况后，夏尔·米尼翁指出，一定要等还在活动的泥土在自然条件下变稳定、变结实之后，才能动手。","The visit of the grand equerry had the ostensible excuse of an important piece of business; namely, the retrieval of an immense tract of waste land left by the sea between the mouths of the two rivers, which tract had just been adjudged by the Council of State to the house of Herouville.The matter was nothing less than putting flood-gates with double bridges, draining three or four hundred acres, cutting canals, and laying out roadways.When the duke had explained the condition of the land, Charles Mignon remarked that time must be allowed for the soil, which was still moving, to settle and grow solid in a natural way."
"“时间让您的家族富了起来，这是天意。公爵先生，仅靠时间就可以完成这一工程，”他总结道，“最好等五十年后再来开拓这块地。”","“Time, which has providentially enriched your house, Monsieur le duc, can alone complete the work,” he said, in conclusion.“It would be prudent to let fifty years elapse before you reclaim the land.”"
"“别把话说死了吧，伯爵先生，”公爵说，“请到埃鲁维尔来亲自看看情况吧。”","“Do not let that be your final word, Monsieur le comte,” said the duke.“Come to Herouville and see things for yourself.”"
"夏尔·米尼翁回答说，每个资本家都要花时间冷静地调查这类事情。这也就给了公爵常到木屋来的借口。第一次见面，莫黛斯特就给这位年轻人留下了深刻的印象。他说他的姐姐和姑姑早就听说过许多有关莫黛斯特的事情，想和她认识，并希望她能赏脸跟她父亲一起去他家里做客。听了这话，伯爵便提议邀请德埃鲁维尔全家在他搬回公馆的那天过来共进晚餐，亲自向两位女士介绍他的女儿。公爵接受了邀请。蓝色腰带，贵族头衔，特别是贵族绅士那心醉神迷的眼神，对莫黛斯特起到了一定的作用，但她在马车装备、高贵气质和谈吐方面表现得更有优势。公爵很不情愿地告辞了，得到了每晚都到木屋来的邀请——邀请的理由是，大家认为查理十世的朝臣一天晚上不玩牌就会受不了。","Charles Mignon replied that every capitalist should take time to examine into such matters with a cool head, thus giving the duke a pretext for his visits to the Chalet.The sight of Modeste made a lively impression on the young man, and he asked the favor of receiving her at Herouville with her father, saying that his sister and his aunt had heard much of her, and wished to make her acquaintance.On this the count proposed to present his daughter to those ladies himself, and invited the whole party to dinner on the day of his return to the villa.The duke accepted the invitation.The blue ribbon, the title, and above all, the ecstatic glances of the noble gentleman had an effect upon Modeste; but she appeared to great advantage in carriage, dignity, and conversation.The duke withdrew reluctantly, carrying with him an invitation to visit the Chalet every evening,—an invitation based on the impossibility of a courtier of Charles X. existing for a single evening without his rubber."
"因此，莫黛斯特第二天晚上要见到她那三位追求者齐聚一堂了。尽管少女们想法各异，尽管情感的逻辑会引导她们为自己的选择牺牲一切，但看到身边围着好几个相互竞争的追求者——要么是杰出的人物，要么是著名的人物，要么名门之后——都争相表现自己，讨好她们，这对于她们的小小自恋来说终归是极大的满足。单独来看，三个人当中的每一个都能满足最挑剔的家庭。看着这三个想法各异的人展开斗争，真是一种乐趣。虽然总地来说，这样的情形让莫黛斯特很头疼，但她事后也承认，在这样的乐趣面前，就连她之前在信中所表达的情感也没那么重要了。然而，她遭受的那次可怕的伤痛——尽管此时，她已经开始学着把这次伤痛看成一次小小的失望——给她带来了厌世情绪，让她没精神享受奢侈的自恋。所以，当她的父亲笑着对她说：“怎么样，莫黛斯特，你想做公爵夫人吗？”她嘲讽地鞠了一躬，回答道：","The following evening, therefore, Modeste was to see all three of her lovers.No matter what young girls may say, and though the logic of the heart may lead them to sacrifice everything to preference, it is extremely flattering to their self-love to see a number of rival adorers around them,—distinguished or celebrated men, or men of ancient lineage,—all endeavoring to shine and to please.Suffer as Modeste may in general estimation, it must be told she subsequently admitted that the sentiments expressed in her letters paled before the pleasure of seeing three such different minds at war with one another,—three men who, taken separately, would each have done honor to the most exacting family.Yet this luxury of self-love was checked by a misanthropical spitefulness, resulting from the terrible wound she had received,—although by this time she was beginning to think of that wound as a disappointment only.So when her father said to her, laughing, “Well, Modeste, do you want to be a duchess?” she answered, with a mocking curtsey,—"
"“悲伤已经让我冷静下来了。”","“Sorrows have made me philosophical.”"
"“你的意思是只做男爵夫人？”比查问道。","“Do you mean to be only a baroness?” asked Butscha."
"“还是做一个子爵夫人？”她的父亲说。","“Or a viscountess?” said her father."
"“怎么可能？”她很快反问道。","“How could that be?” she asked quickly."
"“如果你接受德拉布里埃先生，那他就有足够的声望和影响力来得到国王的准许，继承我的头衔和徽章。”","“If you accept Monsieur de La Briere, he has enough merit and influence to obtain permission from the king to bear my titles and arms.”"
"“噢，凡是遇到需要伪装自己的事，他都能轻而易举地做到。”莫黛斯特轻蔑地说。","“Oh, if it comes to disguising himself, he will not make any difficulty,” said Modeste, scornfully."
"比查没听懂这句讽刺，其深意也只有米尼翁先生、米尼翁夫人和迪迈才猜得出。","Butscha did not understand this epigram, whose meaning could only be guessed by Monsieur and Madame Mignon and Dumay."
"“事关婚姻的时候，所有男人都会伪装自己的，”拉图奈尔评论说，“而女人则给他们做表率。从我来到这个世上，就常听人们说‘此先生或彼小姐结了一门好亲事’——意思是说另一方结了一门坏亲事。”","“When it is a question of marriage, all men disguise themselves,” remarked Latournelle, “and women set them the example.I’ve heard it said ever since I came into the world that ‘Monsieur this or Mademoiselle that has made a good marriage,’—meaning that the other side had made a bad one.”"
"“婚姻，就像一桩诉讼案，”比查说，“总有一方不满意。如果总是一方欺骗另一方，世界上当然就会有一半丈夫是以另一半的利益为代价来出演喜剧。”","“Marriage,” said Butscha, “is like a lawsuit; there’s always one side discontented.If one dupes the other, certainly half the husbands in the world are playing a comedy at the expense of the other half.”"
"“那你的结论是什么呢，比查阁下？”莫黛斯特问道。","“From which you conclude, Sieur Butscha?” inquired Modeste."
"“密切关注敌人的动向。”文书回答说。","“To pay the utmost attention to the manoeuvres of the enemy,” answered the clerk."
"“我跟你说什么来着，我的宝贝？”夏尔·米尼翁说道，暗指他们在海边的那次谈话。","“What did I tell you, my darling?” said Charles Mignon, alluding to their conversation on the seashore."
"“母亲为了让女儿嫁出去，教她们扮演了多少种角色，男人们也就扮演了多少种角色。”拉图奈尔说。","“Men play as many parts to get married as mothers make their daughters play to get rid of them,” said Latournelle."
"“那你是同意使计了？”莫黛斯特说。","“Then you approve of stratagems?” said Modeste."
"“两边都使，”哥本海姆大声说，“这也就公平了。”","“On both sides,” cried Gobenheim, “and that brings it even.”"
"据他们说，这场谈话是在发牌和出牌的间隙中断断续续进行的。话题很快主要转向了德埃鲁维尔公爵的优点，小个子拉图奈尔、小个子迪迈和小个子比查都觉得他长得很好看。要不是先前我们已经讨论过在婚姻大事上使计是否合法，读者很可能会觉得，后面对比查焦心等待着的那个夜晚的描述，有些过于冗长了。","This conversation was carried on by fits and starts, as they say, in the intervals of cutting and dealing the cards; and it soon turned chiefly on the merits of the Duc d’Herouville, who was thought very good-looking by little Latournelle, little Dumay, and little Butscha.Without the foregoing discussion on the lawfulness of matrimonial tricks, the reader might possibly find the forthcoming account of the evening so impatiently awaited by Butscha, somewhat too long."
"著名的外科医生德普兰第二天上午到了，他只呆了一个小时左右，跟派人去勒阿弗尔要马和套车的工夫差不多。检查完米尼翁夫人的眼睛之后，他便判断夫人可以恢复视力，并决定一个月后找个合适的时间做手术。这一重要的诊断是当着木屋所有成员的面进行的，他们胆战心惊地站在那儿，等着听这位科学泰斗的判决。这位著名的科学院院士一面借着窗户透进来的明亮光线检查她的眼睛，一面问了这位失明的太太十几个简单的问题。令莫黛斯特惊讶的是，这么一个大名人竟会如此珍惜时间。她看到旅行马车里装满了这位伟大的外科医生打算在旅途中读的书，因为他是前一天晚上离开巴黎的，晚上的时间都用来睡觉和赶路了。对于米尼翁夫人的回答，德普兰作出了迅速、清晰的判断，加上他简洁的语调、果断的举止，让莫黛斯特第一次真正意识到天才该是什么样。她察觉到了卡那利那样的二流人物跟人中之杰德普兰之间的巨大差别。一个天才，在意识到自己的才能、巩固了自己的声望之后，会找到自己的一片舞台，在那里，他能够施展、发挥他那理所当然的骄傲，而不妨碍其他人。而且，他会一直忙于处理周围的人和事，没时间搞时髦天才的花样。那些时髦天才，他们迫不及待地将转瞬即逝的一季庄稼收割起来，他们虚荣、自私、小气、苛刻，就像一座海关，对经手的所有东西都要征税。","Desplein, the famous surgeon, arrived the next morning, and stayed only long enough to send to Havre for fresh horses and have them put-to, which took about an hour.After examining Madame Mignon’s eyes, he decided that she could recover her sight, and fixed a suitable time, a month later, to perform the operation.This important consultation took place before the assembled members of the Chalet, who stood trembling and expectant to hear the verdict of the prince of science.That illustrious member of the Academy of Sciences put about a dozen brief questions to the blind woman as he examined her eyes in the strong light from a window.Modeste was amazed at the value which a man so celebrated attached to time, when she saw the travelling-carriage piled with books which the great surgeon proposed to read during the journey; for he had left Paris the evening before, and had spent the night in sleeping and travelling.The rapidity and clearness of Desplein’s judgment on each answer made by Madame Mignon, his succinct tone, his decisive manner, gave Modeste her first real idea of a man of genius.She perceived the enormous difference between a second-rate man, like Canalis, and Desplein, who was even more than a superior man.A man of genius finds in the consciousness of his talent and in the solidity of his fame an arena of his own, where his legitimate pride can expand and exercise itself without interfering with others.Moreover, his perpetual struggle with men and things leave them no time for the coxcombry of fashionable genius, which makes haste to gather in the harvests of a fugitive season, and whose vanity and self-love are as petty and exacting as a custom-house which levies tithes on all that comes in its way."
"而这位伟大而务实的天才，有多少女人从他的手经过，可他长期以来都是用放大镜和外科手术刀来检查她们——不过，他显然也被莫黛斯特的惊人美貌吸引了，这就使莫黛斯特更加醉心于他。","Modeste was the more enchanted by this great practical genius, because he was evidently charmed with the exquisite beauty of Modeste,—he, through whose hands so many women had passed, and who had long since examined the sex, as it were, with magnifier and scalpel."
"“这么漂亮的女儿，母亲如果看不到她，”他以殷勤的语气说道，“真是太可惜了。”这种殷勤在他身上太少见了，与他一向的矜持态度形成了鲜明对比。","“It would be a sad pity,” he said, with an air of gallantry which he occasionally put on, and which contrasted with his assumed brusqueness, “if a mother were deprived of the sight of so charming a daughter.”"
"莫黛斯特坚持招待他一顿简单的早餐，这是所有伟大的外科医生都会接受的。她陪着父亲和迪迈走到停在花园门口的马车旁。分别时，她双眼闪着希望的光芒，对德普兰说道：","Modeste insisted on serving the simple breakfast which was all the great surgeon would accept.She accompanied her father and Dumay to the carriage stationed at the garden-gate, and said to Desplein at parting, her eyes shining with hope,—"
"“我亲爱的妈妈真的会看见吗？”","“And will my dear mamma really see me?”"
"“是的，我的小精怪，我向你保证，”他笑着回答，“再说我也不能欺骗你啊，因为我也有一个女儿。”","“Yes, my little sprite, I’ll promise you that,” he answered, smiling; “and I am incapable of deceiving you, for I, too, have a daughter.”"
"他最后这句话充满了出人意料的善意和温情。话音刚落，马车移动起来，载着他离开了。天才身上总有独一无二的出人意料之处，没有什么比这更迷人了。","The horses started and carried him off as he uttered the last words with unexpected grace and feeling.Nothing is more charming than the peculiar unexpectedness of persons of talent."

"这位著名外科医生的来访是当天的一件大事，在莫黛斯特的心灵深处留下了闪光的痕迹。这种男人，他的生命是属于他人的，由于他习惯了研究别人身上的痛苦，自己身上自我主义的表现已经荡然无存。年轻热情的莫黛斯特热烈地钦佩着这样的人。那天晚上，哥本海姆、拉图奈尔夫妇、比查、卡那利、埃内斯特，以及德埃鲁维尔公爵聚集在客厅里，都祝贺德普兰给米尼翁一家带来了希望。谈话自然就转向了德普兰，莫黛斯特又成了信件中那个仰慕天才的少女。不幸的是，德普兰的天才只有科学界的人，或者具有科学才能的人才看得出来。哥本海姆说了一句话，按照当今经济学家和银行家们的理解，这句话简直是给天才涂圣油——","This visit of the great surgeon was the event of the day, and it left a luminous trace in Modeste’s soul.The young enthusiast ardently admired the man whose life belonged to others, and in whom the habit of studying physical suffering had destroyed the manifestations of egoism.That evening, when Gobenheim, the Latournelles, and Butscha, Canalis, Ernest, and the Duc d’Herouville were gathered in the salon, they all congratulated the Mignon family on the hopes which Desplein encouraged.The conversation, in which the Modeste of her letters was once more in the ascendant, turned naturally on the man whose genius, unfortunately for his fame, was appreciable only by the faculty and men of science.Gobenheim contributed a phrase which is the sacred chrism of genius as interpreted in these days by public economists and bankers,—"
"“他赚的钱可多了。”","“He makes a mint of money.”"
"“大家说他很贪婪。”卡那利补充道。","“They say he is very grasping,” added Canalis."
"莫黛斯特对德普兰的盛赞惹得诗人不高兴了。虚荣心的行事方式跟女人心一样——都认为当别人受到热爱或赞扬时，她们就被欺骗了。一个浪荡子被巴黎人赞扬了两天，伏尔泰就嫉妒他的风趣；就连公爵夫人也会因为有人看了她的侍女一眼而感觉受了冒犯。这两种情感太贪婪了，向可怜人施舍一点点，就感觉自己被打劫了似的。","The praises which Modeste showered on Desplein had annoyed the poet.Vanity acts like a woman,—they both think they are defrauded when love or praise is bestowed on others.Voltaire was jealous of the wit of a roue whom Paris admired for two days; and even a duchess takes offence at a look bestowed upon her maid.The avarice excited by these two sentiments is such that a fraction of them given to the poor is thought robbery."
"“先生，”莫黛斯特笑着说，“您觉得我们应该以常规的标准来判断天才吗？”","“Do you think, monsieur,” said Modeste, smiling, “that we should judge genius by ordinary standards?”"
"“也许我们应该首先定义什么是天才。”卡那利回答说，“天才的条件之一就是要发明创造——发明某种形式、某种系统、某种原动力。撇开天才其他的必备条件不谈，拿破仑就是一个发明家。他发明了自己的作战方法。瓦尔特·司各特是发明家，林奈是发明家，杰弗里·圣希莱尔和居维叶都是发明家。这些人是一流的天才人物。他们更新、提高，或改进科学和艺术。但德普兰的巨大才能仅仅在于将已知的规律加以合理运用，通过他的天赋，去观察每一种体质的生理特征，以及大自然给手术设定的时间。他没有像希波克拉底那样，为科学本身奠定基础。他没有像盖仑、布鲁赛，以及拉卓理那样，发明某种系统。他仅仅是一个执行天才，就像弹钢琴的莫舍莱斯、拉小提琴的帕格尼尼、或者歌唱家的法里奈利那样——那些人施展了极大的才能，但却没有创造过音乐。请你们务必允许我将贝多芬和卡塔拉尼区别开来：其中一个拥有天才和殉道者的不朽桂冠，另一个则拥有无数的五法郎硬币；一个我们能用硬币来给他报酬，但对另一个人来说，世界自始至终都亏欠他。我们欠莫里哀的债每天都在增加，但对于巴龙的喜剧，我们付的钱已经太多了。”","“Perhaps we ought first of all to define the man of genius,” replied Canalis.“One of the conditions of genius is invention,—invention of a form, a system, a force.Napoleon was an inventor, apart from his other conditions of genius.He invented his method of making war.Walter Scott is an inventor, Linnaeus is an inventor, Geoffrey Saint-Hilaire and Cuvier are inventors.Such men are men of genius of the first rank.They renew, increase, or modify both science and art.But Desplein is merely a man whose vast talent consists in properly applying laws already known; in observing, by means of a natural gift, the limits laid down for each temperament, and the time appointed by Nature for an operation.He has not founded, like Hippocrates, the science itself.He has invented no system, as did Galen, Broussais, and Rasori.He is merely an executive genius, like Moscheles on the piano, Paganini on the violin, or Farinelli on his own larynx,—men who have developed enormous faculties, but who have not created music.You must permit me to discriminate between Beethoven and la Catalani: to one belongs the immortal crown of genius and of martyrdom, to the other innumerable five-franc pieces; one we can pay in coin, but the world remains throughout all time a debtor to the other.Each day increases our debt to Moliere, but Baron’s comedies have been overpaid.”"
"“我觉得你的观点太过专断了，”拉布里埃说道。他的声音柔和悦耳，顿时与诗人那专横的腔调形成了鲜明对比。诗人原本柔韧的喉咙已经把亲切的语气抛弃了，代之以讲坛上刺耳专断的嗓音。“天才必须要根据其实用性来进行判定。帕尔芒捷让土豆得以普遍食用，雅卡尔发明了丝织机，帕潘首先发现了蒸汽的膨胀性，他们都是天才人物，他们的雕像总有一天会竖起来的。从某种意义上来讲，他们已经改变，或者将会改变国家的面貌。正是从这个意义上来说，德普兰将一直是思想家们眼中的天才人物，他们看见他亲手治愈了一代病人的痛苦。”","“I think you make the prerogative of ideas too exclusive,” said Ernest de La Briere, in a quiet and melodious voice, which formed a sudden contrast to the peremptory tones of the poet, whose flexible organ had abandoned its caressing notes for the strident and magisterial voice of the rostrum.“Genius must be estimated according to its utility; and Parmentier, who brought potatoes into general use, Jacquart, the inventor of silk looms; Papin, who first discovered the elastic quality of steam, are men of genius, to whom statues will some day be erected.They have changed, or they will change in a certain sense, the face of the State.It is in that sense that Desplein will always be considered a man of genius by thinkers; they see him attended by a generation of sufferers whose pains are stifled by his hand.”"
"这个观点是埃内斯特发表的，仅凭这一点，莫黛斯特就要对它进行反驳。","That Ernest should give utterance to this opinion was enough to make Modeste oppose it."
"“按这个道理，先生，”她说，“如果一个人用一台可以干十个人的活儿的机器，发现了一种不损伤麦秆的割麦方法，他也算是天才人物喽。”","“If that be so, monsieur,” she said, “then the man who could discover a way to mow wheat without injuring the straw, by a machine that could do the work of ten men, would be a man of genius.”"
"“当然，我的女儿，”米尼翁夫人说道，“而且穷人会为他祝福，因为他让面包变得便宜——受到穷苦人民祝福的人，也会得到上帝的赐福。”","“Yes, my daughter,” said Madame Mignon; “and the poor would bless him for cheaper bread,—he that is blessed by the poor is blessed of God.”"
"“那是把实用性置于艺术之上了。”莫黛斯特摇摇头说说。","“That is putting utility above art,” said Modeste, shaking her head."
"“没了实用性，哪儿来艺术呢？”夏尔·米尼翁说，“艺术又以何为基础？以何为生呢？你又到哪儿去住，怎样给诗人以报偿呢？”","“Without utility what would become of art?” said Charles Mignon.“What would it rest on? what would it live on?Where would you lodge, and how would you pay the poet?”"
"“唉呀！我亲爱的爸爸，这些观点真是太单调了，老掉牙了！哥本海姆和德拉布里埃先生关心的是如何解决社会问题，他们这样想，我并不感到奇怪。但您的人生本来就是本世纪最不实用的一首诗歌——因为您的鲜血洒遍了欧洲，一个超级大国让您饱受可怕的痛苦，而您的鲜血与痛苦却没能阻止法兰西丢掉大革命时代赢得的十个省——您怎么能屈从于理想主义者们这种超级顽固的观点呢？看来您真是刚从中国回来的。”","“Oh! my dear papa, such opinions are fearfully flat and antediluvian!I am not surprised that Gobenheim and Monsieur de La Briere, who are interested in the solution of social problems should think so; but you, whose life has been the most useless poetry of the century,—useless because the blood you shed all over Europe, and the horrible sufferings exacted by your colossus, did not prevent France from losing ten departments acquired under the Revolution,—how can you give in to such excessively pig-tail notions, as the idealists say?It is plain you’ve just come from China.”"
"莫黛斯特出言不逊，加上她故意采用轻蔑不屑的语气，就更显出这番话的无礼。米尼翁夫人、拉图奈尔夫人和迪迈听了都大吃一惊。拉图奈尔夫人眼睛睁得大大的，不明白怎么回事。比查的专注和警惕可以比得上一个间谍，他看着米尼翁先生，料想他会脸色大变，暴跳如雷。","The impertinence of Modeste’s speech was heightened by a little air of contemptuous disdain which she purposely put on, and which fairly astounded Madame Mignon, Madame Latournelle, and Dumay.As for Madame Latournelle, she opened her eyes so wide she no longer saw anything.Butscha, whose alert attention was comparable to that of a spy, looked at Monsieur Mignon, expecting to see him flush with sudden and violent indignation."
"“小姑娘，再多说几句，你就是对父亲不敬了。”看到比查的眼神，中校笑着说道，“看，这就是娇惯自己的孩子的后果啊！”","“A little more, young lady, and you will be wanting in respect for your father,” said the colonel, smiling, and noticing Butscha’s look.“See what it is to spoil one’s children!”"
"“我是您唯一的孩子嘛。”她调皮地说道。","“I am your only child,” she said saucily."
"“的确还是孩子。”公证人意味深长地评论道。","“Child, indeed,” remarked the notary, significantly."
"“先生，”莫黛斯特转向他说，“我父亲很高兴让我做他的女家庭教师。他给了我生命，而我给了他知识，很快，他就会欠我的了呢。”","“Monsieur,” said Modeste, turning upon him, “my father is delighted to have me for his governess; he gave me life and I give him knowledge; he will soon owe me something.”"
"“说话要注意场合。”米尼翁夫人说。","“There seems occasion for it,” said Madame Mignon."
"“但小姐说得对啊，”卡那利站了起来，在壁炉前摆出他的风姿宝库中最漂亮的姿势，说道，“上帝很有远见，他给了人类食物和衣服，但却没有直接给人类艺术。他对人类说：‘为了生存，你要向大地弯腰；为了思考，你要向我攀升。’我们对心灵生命的需要，同对肉体生命的需要一样多——因此，就有了两种实用性。当然，我们不能把书当鞋穿，或者把诗当衣服穿。如果从实用性的角度来看，一首史诗还抵不上慈善厨房的一碗肉汤。最高贵的思想也代替不了船帆，让船起航。的确，轧花机使每码棉布的价格降低了三十苏，但这种机器，以及其他所有完美的工业产品，都不能给人以生命的气息，也不能告诉未来的人曾经的文明是什么样子。相反，艺术，埃及艺术、墨西哥艺术、希腊艺术、罗马艺术，连同它们被你们称作没用的伟大作品，却证明了在悠远的过去，确实有人类文明的存在，尽管中间那些伟大民族的天才已经死去，没有留下一点儿痕迹！天才的作品都是文明的顶峰，含有预设的实用性。一双靴子当然没有剧院的一出优秀戏剧那样养眼，而且比起圣望教堂，你也不会更喜欢一座风车，对吧？那好，民族也同个人一样，充满着同样的情感，而一个人内心珍藏的愿望就是在精神上得到永生，正如他希望在肉体上传宗接代一样。一个民族的生存是其天才人物的作用。此时的法兰西就能有力地证明这一理论的正确性。毫无疑问，在贸易、工业和航海方面，英国要胜过法国，但我相信，由于艺术家、天才人物，以及艺术作品的良好品味，法国才是世界的领头者。没有一个艺术家，也没有一个优秀的人才，不到巴黎来寻求资格证明。目前只有法国才有绘画学校。我们用书籍去统治人民，要比用剑去统治更长久，或许也更稳固。而另一方面，在拉布里埃的体系里，所有辉煌美好的东西都要被压制——女人的美貌、音乐、绘画、诗歌。不错，社会是不会被推翻，但我问你，谁会愿意过这样的生活？所有有用的东西都既丑陋又可怕。厨房是必不可少的，但您不会在那儿起居，您生活在客厅里，用奢侈的东西来装点它，就像这间客厅一样。我请问您，这些迷人的壁画，这件精雕细琢的木器，有什么用呢？只有在我们看来没用的东西，才是美的。我们称十六世纪为文艺复兴时期，这个说法准确到了精妙的地步。十六世纪是一个新时代的开端。当之前那些世纪的记忆都被抹去，人们仍会继续谈论这个世纪——之前那些世纪，它们唯一的价值在于它们曾经存在过，就像一代当人中像垃圾般微不足道的芸芸众生一样。”","“But mademoiselle is right,” said Canalis, rising and standing before the fireplace in one of the finest attitudes of his collection.“God, in his providence, has given food and clothing to man, but he has not directly given him art.He says to man: ‘To live, thou must bow thyself to earth; to think, thou shalt lift thyself to Me.’We have as much need of the life of the soul as of the life of the body,—hence, there are two utilities.It is true we cannot be shod by books or clothed by poems.An epic song is not, if you take the utilitarian view, as useful as the broth of a charity kitchen.The noblest ideas will not sail a vessel in place of canvas.It is quite true that the cotton-gin gives us calicoes for thirty sous a yard less than we ever paid before; but that machine and all other industrial perfections will not breathe the breath of life into a people, will not tell futurity of a civilization that once existed.Art, on the contrary, Egyptian, Mexican, Grecian, Roman art, with their masterpieces—now called useless!—reveal the existence of races back in the vague immense of time, beyond where the great intermediary nations, denuded of men of genius, have disappeared, leaving not a line nor a trace behind them!The works of genius are the ‘summum’ of civilization, and presuppose utility.Surely a pair of boots are not as agreeable to your eyes as a fine play at the theatre; and you don’t prefer a windmill to the church of Saint-Ouen, do you?Well then, nations are imbued with the same feelings as the individual man, and the man’s cherished desire is to survive himself morally just as he propagates himself physically.The survival of a people is the work of its men of genius.At this very moment France is proving, energetically, the truth of that theory.She is, undoubtedly, excelled by England in commerce, industry, and navigation, and yet she is, I believe, at the head of the world,—by reason of her artists, her men of talent, and the good taste of her products.There is no artist and no superior intellect that does not come to Paris for a diploma.There is no school of painting at this moment but that of France; and we shall reign far longer and perhaps more securely by our books than by our swords.In La Briere’s system, on the other hand, all that is glorious and lovely must be suppressed,—woman’s beauty, music, painting, poetry.Society will not be overthrown, that is true, but, I ask you, who would willingly accept such a life?All useful things are ugly and forbidding.A kitchen is indispensable, but you take care not to sit there; you live in the salon, which you adorn, like this, with superfluous things.Of what use, let me ask you, are these charming wall-paintings, this carved wood-work?There is nothing beautiful but that which seems to us useless.We called the sixteenth century the Renascence with admirable truth of language.That century was the dawn of a new era.Men will continue to speak of it when all remembrance of anterior centuries had passed away,—their only merit being that they once existed, like the million beings who count as the rubbish of a generation.”"
"“垃圾！对，也许是那样，但我的垃圾对我来说也是宝贵的。”埃鲁维尔公爵趁诗人浮夸的演说结束后大家沉默之际，笑着说道。","“Rubbish! yes, that may be, but my rubbish is dear to me,” said the Duc d’Herouville, laughing, during the silent pause which followed the poet’s pompous oration."
"“我请问您，”比查抨击卡那利，“根据您的说法，天才要在艺术领域自我进化，可这种艺术真的存在吗？这难道不是人类社会的一个堂皇的谎言,不是一种错觉吗？当我透过卧室窗户能看到一幅更美的、上帝自己创造的风景画时，还会想要一幅诺曼底风景画吗？我们的梦想有着比《伊利亚特》更为壮丽的诗篇。只需一点点钱，我就可以在瓦洛涅、卡朗丹、普罗旺斯和阿尔勒找到许多跟提香笔下的维纳斯一样漂亮的美人儿。《司法公报》上刊登的故事，写作手法与瓦尔特·司各特的小说略有不同，但悲惨的结局却是以鲜血、而非墨水写就的。幸福和美德存在于艺术和天才之上，高于艺术和天才。”","“Let me ask,” said Butscha, attacking Canalis, “does art, the sphere in which, according to you, genius is required to evolve itself, exist at all?Is it not a splendid lie, a delusion, of the social man?Do I want a landscape scene of Normandy in my bedroom when I can look out and see a better one done by God himself?Our dreams make poems more glorious than Iliads.For an insignificant sum of money I can find at Valogne, at Carentan, in Provence, at Arles, many a Venus as beautiful as those of Titian.The police gazette publishes tales, differing somewhat from those of Walter Scott, but ending tragically with blood, not ink.Happiness and virtue exist above and beyond both art and genius.”"
"“说得好，比查！”拉图奈尔夫人大声说道。","“Bravo, Butscha!” cried Madame Latournelle."
"“他说什么了？”卡那利没能从米尼翁小姐的眼神和态度中找到平日里那种不加掩饰的赞赏，便向拉布里埃问道。","“What did he say?” asked Canalis of La Briere, failing to gather from the eyes and attitude of Mademoiselle Mignon the usual signs of artless admiration."
"莫黛斯特对拉布里埃表现出的蔑视和冷漠，还有最重要的，她对父亲的出言不逊，让这位年轻人很是沮丧。因此，他没有回答卡那利的问题，而是悲伤地注视着莫黛斯特，陷入了沉思。埃鲁维尔公爵接着比查的论点，将其重述了一遍，话语间充满了智慧。他最后说，圣女泰蕾丝的狂喜要比拜伦爵士的创作高明得多。","The contemptuous indifference which Modeste had exhibited toward La Briere, and above all, her disrespectful speeches to her father, so depressed the young man that he made no answer to Canalis; his eyes, fixed sorrowfully on Modeste, were full of deep meditation.The Duc d’Herouville took up Butscha’s argument and reproduced it with much intelligence, saying finally that the ecstasies of Saint-Theresa were far superior to the creations of Lord Byron."
"“哎呀，公爵先生，”莫黛斯特惊呼道，“圣女泰蕾丝仅仅是个人的诗篇，而拜伦爵士和莫里哀的天才则让全世界受益啊。”","“Oh, Monsieur le duc,” exclaimed Modeste, “hers was a purely personal poetry, whereas the genius of Lord Byron and Moliere benefit the world.”"
"“你的观点怎么又跟男爵先生的一致了？”夏尔·米尼翁马上大声说道，“现在，你坚持说天才要有用，而且要像棉花那样，让全世界受益——但也许你把逻辑看得跟你可怜的老父亲一样老土过时了。”","“How do you square that opinion with those of Monsieur le baron?” cried Charles Mignon, quickly.“Now you are insisting that genius must be useful, and benefit the world as though it were cotton,—but perhaps you think logic as antediluvian as your poor old father.”"
"比查、拉布里埃和拉图奈尔夫人互相交换了眼神，嘲讽之情溢于言表，这使莫黛斯特气恼到了极点，好一会儿都沉默不语。","Butscha, La Briere, and Madame Latournelle exchanged glances that were more than half derisive, and drove Modeste to a pitch of irritation that kept her silent for a moment."
"“小姐，您别介意，”卡那利对她笑着说道，“我们既没被打倒，也没陷入矛盾之中。每一件艺术作品，不管是文学、音乐、绘画、雕塑，或者建筑，都同其他所有的商业产品一样，包含着一种积极的社会功用。艺术是卓越的商业，简言之，艺术预示着商业。一位作家靠他的一本书，就把一万法郎收入囊中，而出书还需要造纸厂、铸造厂、印刷厂、销售商——换句话说，就需要雇用成千上万个人。演奏一部贝多芬的交响乐，或罗西尼的歌剧，也需要人的臂膀、器械，以及制造商。耗资巨大的纪念碑就是一个几近残酷的例子。总之，我可以说天才的作品是以极其高昂的代价为基础的，因而必然是对劳动者有用的。”","“Mademoiselle, do not mind them,” said Canalis, smiling upon her, “we are neither beaten, nor caught in a contradiction.Every work of art, let it be in literature, music, painting, sculpture, or architecture, implies a positive social utility, equal to that of all other commercial products.Art is pre-eminently commerce; presupposes it, in short.An author pockets ten thousand francs for his book; the making of books means the manufactory of paper, a foundry, a printing-office, a bookseller,—in other words, the employment of thousands of men.The execution of a symphony of Beethoven or an opera by Rossini requires human arms and machinery and manufactures.The cost of a monument is an almost brutal case in point.In short, I may say that the works of genius have an extremely costly basis and are, necessarily, useful to the workingman.”"
"卡那利用连篇累牍的比喻和让自己洋洋得意的华丽词藻，就这一话题演说了好几分钟，但同其他许多演说家一样，他最后发现自己兜了一圈又回到了原地，而且跟拉布里埃的观点完全一致，只是自己还浑然不知。","Astride of that theme, Canalis spoke for some minutes with a fine luxury of metaphor, and much inward complacency as to his phrases; but it happened with him, as with many another great speaker, that he found himself at last at the point from which the conversation started, and in full agreement with La Briere without perceiving it."
"“我非常高兴，我亲爱的男爵，”小个子公爵狡黠地说道，“您将会成为一名出色的立宪大臣。”","“I see with much pleasure, my dear baron,” said the little duke, slyly, “that you will make an admirable constitutional minister.”"
"“咳！”卡那利摆出一副大人物的姿态，说，“所有这些讨论有何用处呢？它们能证明什么呢？——无非是一个永恒的真理：一切都是真的，一切又都是假的。人类，还有道义上的真理，都会根据周围环境的改变而改变立场，最终面目全非。”","“Oh!” said Canalis, with the gesture of a great man, “what is the use of all these discussions?What do they prove?—the eternal verity of one axiom:All things are true, all things are false.Moral truths as well as human beings change their aspect according to their surroundings, to the point of being actually unrecognizable.”"
"“社会是依赖固有的观念而存在的。”德埃鲁维尔公爵说道。","“Society exists through settled opinions,” said the Duc d’Herouville."
"“多轻浮啊！”拉图奈尔夫人对她的丈夫说道。","“What laxity!” whispered Madame Latournelle to her husband."
"“他是诗人嘛。”哥本海姆刚好听到了她的话，便说道。","“He is a poet,” said Gobenheim, who overheard her."
"在这群听众面前，卡那利高高在上，而他最后说的那句富有哲理的话也许是对的。他见周围人的脸上都是冷漠的表情，还以为那是外省人无知的征兆，但看到莫黛斯特明白他的意思，也就满足了。他完全没有意识到，他那番长篇大论让这些乡下人很不高兴，因为他们的主要愿望是向巴黎人展示外省的生活方式、风趣，以及智慧。","Canalis, who was ten leagues above the heads of his audience, and who may have been right in his last philosophical remark, took the sort of coldness which now overspread the surrounding faces of a symptom of provincial ignorance; but seeing that Modeste understood him, he was content, being wholly unaware that monologue is particularly disagreeable to country-folk, whose principal desire it is to exhibit the manner of life and the wit and wisdom of the provinces to Parisians."
"“您已经好久没见到肖利厄公爵夫人了吧？”公爵问卡那利，像是要转换话题。","“It is long since you have seen the Duchesse de Chaulieu?” asked the duke, addressing Canalis, as if to change the conversation."
"“我六天前离开她的。”","“I left her about six days ago.”"
"“她好吗？”公爵穷追不舍。","“Is she well?” persisted the duke."
"“非常好。”","“Perfectly well.”"
"“您给她写信的时候，麻烦您代我向她问好。”","“Have the kindness to remember me to her when you write.”"
"“人家说她很迷人。”莫黛斯特对公爵说道。","“They say she is charming,” remarked Modeste, addressing the duke."
"“对此男爵先生比我更有发言权。”大总管回答说。","“Monsieur le baron can speak more confidently than I,” replied the grand equerry."
"“岂止是迷人，”卡那利充分利用了公爵对他的出卖，说道，“不过我这么说有点偏心，小姐。我们已经有十年的交情了，我所拥有的一切美好的东西，都是她给的，她保护我远离上流社会的各种危险。还有，是肖利厄公爵先生帮助我开创了如今的事业。没有他们一家的影响力，国王和王后可能早就忘记了我这么一个可怜的诗人。因此，我对公爵夫人必须永远充满感激之情。”","“More than charming,” said Canalis, making the best of the duke’s perfidy; “but I am partial, mademoiselle; she has been a friend to me for the last ten years; I owe all that is good in me to her; she has saved me from the dangers of the world.Moreover, Monsieur le Duc de Chaulieu launched me in my present career.Without the influence of that family the king and the princesses would have forgotten a poor poet like me; therefore my affection for the duchess must always be full of gratitude.”"
"他的声音颤抖了。","His voice quivered."
"“对于这位引导您写出那些伟大诗作，并赋予您如此高贵情感的夫人，我们应该热爱她。”莫黛斯特感动不已，说道，“诗人要是没了缪斯陪伴，会是什么样子！”","“We ought to love the woman who has led you to write those sublime poems, and who inspires you with such noble feelings,” said Modeste, quite affected.“Who can think of a poet without a muse!”"
"“他的心灵会迷失，”卡那利回答说，“他会像从来不爱别人、只爱自己的伏尔泰那样，写出空洞的诗文。”","“He would be without a heart,” replied Canalis.“He would write barren verses like Voltaire, who never loved any one but Voltaire.”"
"“我记得我在巴黎时有幸听您说过，”迪迈打断了他的话，“您从未感受到过您所表达的情感。”","“I thought you did me the honor to say, in Paris,” interrupted Dumay, “that you never felt the sentiments you expressed.”"
"“脚正不怕鞋歪，我的军人，”诗人笑着回答说，“但让我告诉您，在精神生活和现实生活中都拥有很多情感，是很有可能的。我这位好朋友拉布里埃，他疯狂地陷入了爱情之中。”卡那利看着莫黛斯特，摆出一副慷慨的姿态，继续说道，“我呢，当然也和他一样爱得强烈——至少我觉得是这样，除非我是在欺骗自己——不过，我能赋予我的爱情一种文学形式，与这份爱和谐统一。但我不敢说，小姐，”他摆出一种过分做作的风度，转向莫黛斯特，补充道，“我明天是不会没有灵感的。”","“The shoe fits, my soldier,” replied the poet, smiling; “but let me tell you that it is quite possible to have a great deal of feeling both in the intellectual life and in real life.My good friend here, La Briere, is madly in love,” continued Canalis, with a fine show of generosity, looking at Modeste.“I, who certainly love as much as he,—that is, I think so unless I delude myself,—well, I can give to my love a literary form in harmony with its character.But I dare not say, mademoiselle,” he added, turning to Modeste with too studied a grace, “that tomorrow I may not be without inspiration.”"
"这样，诗人便克服了所有的困难。为了爱情，他对挡在路上的障碍奋力回击，他那慷慨激昂的演说中焕发出的巴黎人的机智令莫黛斯特赞叹不已，但她对那种机智还了解甚少，或者说是一无所知。","Thus the poet triumphed over all obstacles.In honor of his love he rode atilt at the hindrances that were thrown in his way, and Modeste remained wonder-struck at the Parisian wit that scintillated in his declamatory discourse, of which she had hitherto known little or nothing."
"米尼翁夫人说了句什么话，卡那利便就天主教信仰和拥有一位虔诚妻子的幸福发表了一番慷慨激昂的演说。比查听了，便对拉图奈尔小声说道：“真是个见风使舵的家伙！”","“What an acrobat!” whispered Butscha to Latournelle, after listening to a magnificent tirade on the Catholic religion and the happiness of having a pious wife,—served up in response to a remark by Madame Mignon."
"莫黛斯特的眼睛好像被蒙住了。卡那利的演说艺术，加上她事先便打定主意要密切关注卡那利，使她看不到比查正在细致地观察卡那利的演说。比查注意到卡那利的演讲中缺乏纯真质朴，真情实感被强调语气所取代，还有许多奇怪的不连贯，便在心里严厉地批判了他一番。卡那利说话过程中，有好几次让米尼翁先生、迪迈、比查和拉图奈尔觉得他的话彻底缺乏逻辑。而莫黛斯特却很是崇拜他的机灵，并一面把他拽进幻想的迷宫，一面对自己说：“他爱我！”比查和这出舞台剧的其他观众一样，对于所有自我主义者共同的显著缺点吃惊不已。而卡那利也和许多习惯于长篇大论的人一样，将自己的缺点暴露无遗。也许他事先就明白了对方的意思，也许他根本就没在听，也许他有着一边听别人讲话一边思考其他问题的本事，但可以肯定的是，梅尔基奥尔在谈话时总是一副心不在焉的样子，这打乱了别人的想法，也伤了别人的自尊。不听别人讲话不仅仅是一种不礼貌，也是不尊重他人的一种体现。卡那利把这个习惯表现得太过分了，因为他常常忘了回答需要回答的话，并且不经过平常的礼貌过渡，便一意孤行地转移到他自己想说的任何话题上去。尽管一个声名显赫的人的鲁莽之举，能被他人平静接受，但它却在许多人的心里种下了仇恨和报复的种子，而在那些同等地位的人心里，它甚至会毁掉友情。如果梅尔基奥尔碰巧被迫听了别人的话，他又会犯另一个错误：他只是听听，但从来不发表意见。虽然这可能不会那么令人难堪，但它会表现为一种半妥协的样子，同样会令听者不满、不高兴。在社交中，没有什么能比给予一点点专注带来更多的好处了。“谁听话，就让谁听见”，这不仅仅是一句福音箴言，还是一桩极好的投机买卖。如果你遵循这句话，人们就会原谅你做的一切，甚至是恶行。卡那利费尽心机，急于讨好莫黛斯特，可虽然他对莫黛斯特万分顺从，却还是在其他人面前现出了真面目。","Modeste’s eyes were blindfolded as it were; Canalis’s elocution and the close attention which she was predetermined to pay to him prevented her from seeing that Butscha was carefully noting the declamation, the want of simplicity, the emphasis that took the place of feeling, and the curious incoherencies in the poet’s speech which led the dwarf to make his rather cruel comment.At certain points of Canalis’s discourse, when Monsieur Mignon, Dumay, Butscha, and Latournelle wondered at the man’s utter want of logic, Modeste admired his suppleness, and said to herself, as she dragged him after her through the labyrinth of fancy, “He loves me!”Butscha, in common with the other spectators of what we must call a stage scene, was struck with the radiant defect of all egoists, which Canalis, like many men accustomed to perorate, allowed to be too plainly seen.Whether he understood beforehand what the person he was speaking to meant to say, whether he was not listening, or whether he had the faculty of listening when he was thinking of something else, it is certain that Melchior’s face wore an absent-minded look in conversation, which disconcerted the ideas of others and wounded their vanity.Not to listen is not merely a want of politeness, it is a mark of disrespect.Canalis pushed this habit too far; for he often forgot to answer a speech which required an answer, and passed, without the ordinary transitions of courtesy, to the subject, whatever it was, that preoccupied him.Though such impertinence is accepted without protest from a man of marked distinction, it stirs a leaven of hatred and vengeance in many hearts; in those of equals it even goes so far as to destroy a friendship.If by chance Melchior was forced to listen, he fell into another fault; he merely lent his attention, and never gave it.Though this may not be so mortifying, it shows a kind of semi-concession which is almost as unsatisfactory to the hearer and leaves him dissatisfied.Nothing brings more profit in the commerce of society than the small change of attention.He that heareth let him hear, is not only a gospel precept, it is an excellent speculation; follow it, and all will be forgiven you, even vice.Canalis took a great deal of trouble in his anxiety to please Modeste; but though he was compliant enough with her, he fell back into his natural self with the others."
"莫黛斯特对因她而受苦的十位殉道者毫不留情，请求卡那利朗读他的一些诗作。她说她听太多人谈起过卡那利的朗读才华，想见识见识。卡那利拿起莫黛斯特递给他的诗卷，有气无力地（这个词再合适不过了）朗诵了一首大家公认的他最好的诗歌——诗歌模仿莫尔的《天使之爱》，名字叫做“维塔利斯”。迪迈夫妇、拉图奈尔夫人，以及哥本海姆打着呵欠欢迎诗人朗诵。","Modeste, pitiless for the ten martyrs she was making, begged Canalis to read some of his poems; she wanted, she said, a specimen of his gift for reading, of which she had heard so much.Canalis took the volume which she gave him, and cooed (for that is the proper word) a poem which is generally considered his finest,—an imitation of Moore’s “Loves of the Angels,” entitled “Vitalis,” which Monsieur and Madame Dumay, Madame Latournelle, and Gobenheim welcomed with a few yawns."
"“如果您惠斯特牌也玩得不错，先生，”哥本海姆挥着手中小扇子似的五张牌，说道，“那我必须得说，我从来都没碰到过像您这样有才艺的人。”","“If you are a good whist-player, monsieur,” said Gobenheim, flourishing five cards held like a fan, “I must say I have never met a man as accomplished as you.”"
"这句话引起了一阵笑声，因为它正好表达了每个人的想法。","The remark raised a laugh, for it was the translation of everybody’s thought."
"“我玩得还可以，足够打发我在外省剩下的日子。”卡那利回答说，“我觉得，对于玩惠斯特牌的人来说，我的文学天赋和谈吐已经足够了，甚至有些过剩。”他颇不耐烦地将诗卷扔到桌子上，补充道。","“I play it sufficiently well to live in the provinces for the rest of my days,” replied Canalis.“That, I think, is enough, and more than enough literature and conversation for whist-players,” he added, throwing the volume impatiently on a table."
"这个小插曲表明，像卡那利这样的沙龙英雄一旦走出自己的领地，会被怎样的危险包围。他就像二流观众最喜爱的演员，当他离开自己的舞台、踏上一座高级剧院的舞台时，他就黔驴技穷了。","This little incident serves to show what dangers environ a drawing-room hero when he steps, like Canalis, out of his sphere; he is like the favorite actor of a second-rate audience, whose talent is lost when he leaves his own boards and steps upon those of an upper-class theatre."
"第二十一章 莫黛斯特行使职权","Chapter XXI Modeste Plays Her Part"
"男爵和公爵做搭档，哥本海姆和拉图奈尔做搭档，四人开始玩牌。莫黛斯特坐在诗人旁边，这使埃内斯特十分失落。他看着这位任性女孩的脸庞，注意到卡那利对她的吸引力越来越大。拉布里埃是没有梅尔基奥尔那种诱人的天赋的。自然往往不会将这种天赋赐予那些真心实意的人，因为他们通常是腼腆胆怯的。而这种天赋要求脸皮厚、手段灵活，甚至说是见风使舵，还伴随着小小的伪装。事实上，从道德上来讲，诗人身上总有一些喜剧演员的味道。将那些我们可以想象其千变万化、却感受不到的情感表达出来，和为了在个人生活的舞台上争取成功而假装能感受到这些情感，这两者之间是有很大区别的。然而，尽管诗人可能已经被社交场合人人必备的虚伪毒害了，他最终还是能用他的才能来表达任何需要的情感，就好像一位注定孤独的伟人最后将他的心灵注入到理性当中一样。","The game opened with the baron and the duke, Gobenheim and Latournelle as partners.Modeste took a seat near the poet, to Ernest’s deep disappointment; he watched the face of the wayward girl, and marked the progress of the fascination which Canalis exerted over her.La Briere had not the gift of seduction which Melchior possessed.Nature frequently denies it to true hearts, who are, as a rule, timid.This gift demands fearlessness, an alacrity of ways and means that might be called the trapeze of the mind; a little mimicry goes with it; in fact there is always, morally speaking, something of the comedian in a poet.There is a vast difference between expressing sentiments we do not feel, though we may imagine all their variations, and feigning to feel them when bidding for success on the theatre of private life.And yet, though the necessary hypocrisy of a man of the world may have gangrened a poet, he ends by carrying the faculties of his talent into the expression of any required sentiment, just as a great man doomed to solitude ends by infusing his heart into his mind."
"“他的目标是拥有几百万，”拉布里埃伤心地想道，“而他能装作有情，装得如此逼真，莫黛斯特会相信他的。”","“He is after the millions,” thought La Briere, sadly; “and he can play passion so well that Modeste will believe him.”"
"埃内斯特没有试图表现得比他的情敌更讨喜、更聪明，反而学了德埃鲁维尔公爵，总是面色沮丧、焦急不安、谨慎小心。在情报员研究年轻女嗣出格的言行时，埃内斯特却只能被满心隐匿的忌妒所折磨。到目前为止，他的偶像都还没看过他一眼。过了一会儿，他同比查出去了。","Instead of endeavoring to appear more amiable and wittier than his rival, Ernest imitated the Duc d’Herouville, and was gloomy, anxious, and watchful; but whereas the courier studied the freaks of the young heiress, Ernest simply fell a prey to the pains of dark and concentrated jealousy.He had not yet been able to obtain a glance from his idol.After a while he left the room with Butscha."
"“一切都结束了！”他说，“她已经被卡那利征服了，她更加讨厌我了。更何况，她是对的。卡那利魅力四射，他的沉默之中蕴含着才智，双眼之中带着热情，夸夸其谈中也富有诗意。”","“It is all over!” he said; “she is caught by him; I am more disagreeable to her, and moreover, she is right.Canalis is charming; there’s intellect in his silence, passion in his eyes, poetry in his rhodomontades.”"
"“他正直诚实吗？”比查问道。","“Is he an honest man?” asked Butscha."
"“噢，是的，”拉布里埃回答说，“他忠诚，有骑士风度，而且在莫黛斯特的影响下，能够丢掉德肖利厄夫人教给他的那些矫揉造作。”","“Oh, yes,” replied La Briere.“He is loyal and chivalrous, and capable of getting rid, under Modeste’s influence, of those affectations which Madame de Chaulieu has taught him.”"
"“您真是个好小伙子，”驼子说，“但他有能力爱她吗——他以后会爱她吗？”","“You are a fine fellow,” said the hunchback; “but is he capable of loving,—will he love her?”"
"“我不知道。”拉布里埃回答说，“她说过我什么吗？”他沉默了一会儿，问道。","“I don’t know,” answered La Briere.“Has she said anything about me?” he asked after a moment’s silence."
"“说过。”比查说，接着便把莫黛斯特说的关于欺世盗名的话重复了一遍。","“Yes,” said Butscha, and he repeated Modeste’s speech about disguises."
"可怜的埃内斯特一屁股坐到凳子上，双手抱着头。他忍不住流泪，又不想让比查看到他哭，但这个小矮人正是能猜透他感情的人。","Poor Ernest flung himself upon a bench and held his head in his hands.He could not keep back his tears, and he did not wish Butscha to see them; but the dwarf was the very man to guess his emotion."
"“您怎么了？”他问道。","“What troubles you?” he asked."
"“她说得对！”埃内斯特突然站起来，哭喊道，“我是个无耻之徒。”","“She is right!” cried Ernest, springing up; “I am a wretch.”"
"于是他将收到莫黛斯特的第一封信后，卡那利如何指使他干了那件欺世盗名之事的经过说了一遍，并向比查强调，他本想在这位少女自己摘下面纱之前说明真相，与此同时，他还极其幼稚地顿呼自己命运不济。比查同情埃内斯特，他从对方那言简意赅的语言和激动的情绪中，从他那深沉而真切的焦虑中，明白了他的爱。","And he related the deception into which Canalis had led him when Modeste’s first letter was received, carefully pointing out to Butscha that he had wished to undeceive the young girl before she herself took off the mask, and apostrophizing, in rather juvenile fashion, his luckless destiny.Butscha sympathetically understood the love in the flavor and vigor of his simple language, and in his deep and genuine anxiety."
"“可您为什么不向莫黛斯特小姐展现真正的自我呢？”他说，“您为什么让您的情敌大显神通呢？”","“But why don’t you show yourself to Mademoiselle Modeste for what you are?” he said; “why do you let your rival do his exercises?”"
"“难道您没感觉到，一想跟她说话，喉咙就发紧吗？”拉布里埃大声说道，“当她看着您的时候——哪怕她正在想着其他事情，难道在您的发根和皮肤表面，就没有一种奇怪的感觉吗？”","“Have you never felt your throat tighten when you wished to speak to her?” cried La Briere; “is there never a strange feeling in the roots of your hair and on the surface of your skin when she looks at you,—even if she is thinking of something else?”"
"“但是，当她对她出色的父亲说他是个笨蛋的时候，您颇具判断力地表现出了不悦之色。”","“But you had sufficient judgment to show displeasure when she as good as told her excellent father that he was a dolt.”"
"“先生，我太爱她了，当我听到她用话语破坏自身的完美时，就像有一把匕首刺进我的胸膛。”","“Monsieur, I love her too well not to have felt a knife in my heart when I heard her contradicting her own perfections.”"
"“可卡那利却支持她。”","“Canalis supported her.”"
"“如果她的自私要比良心更多，那一个男人失去了她，也没什么好后悔的。”拉布里埃回答说。","“If she had more self-love than heart there would be nothing for a man to regret in losing her,” answered La Briere."
"这时候，莫黛斯特跟着输了牌的卡那利、她的父亲，还有迪迈夫人一起走了出来，呼吸这满天繁星之夜的新鲜空气。夏尔·米尼翁趁女儿陪卡那利散步的时候离开了她，来到拉布里埃这边。","At this moment, Modeste, followed by Canalis, who had lost the rubber, came out with her father and Madame Dumay to breathe the fresh air of the starry night.While his daughter walked about with the poet, Charles Mignon left her and came up to La Briere."
"“先生，您的朋友本应该当律师的。”他微笑地注视着这位年轻人，说道。","“Your friend, monsieur, ought to have been a lawyer,” he said, smiling and looking attentively at the young man."
"“伯爵先生，您不该像评判一个普通人——比如说我——那样来评判一位诗人。”拉布里埃说，“诗人有他的使命。他受天性驱使，会看到问题诗意的一面，就像他表达事物的诗意一样。当您认为他没有坚持自我时，其实他是在忠于他的使命。他就像一位画家，把圣母玛利亚和交际花画得同样真实。莫里哀塑造的老年人和年轻人一样逼真，而且莫里哀的判断力确实是合理、健全的。这些诙谐的诡辩对二流的人可能是危险的，但对伟人的品格却没有真正影响。”","“You must not judge a poet as you would an ordinary man,—as you would me, for example, Monsieur le comte,” said La Briere.“A poet has a mission.He is obliged by his nature to see the poetry of questions, just as he expresses that of things.When you think him inconsistent with himself he is really faithful to his vocation.He is a painter copying with equal truth a Madonna and a courtesan.Moliere is as true to nature in his old men as in his young ones, and Moliere’s judgment was assuredly a sound and healthy one.These witty paradoxes might be dangerous for second-rate minds, but they have no real influence on the character of great men.”"
"夏尔·米尼翁握紧了拉布里埃的手。","Charles Mignon pressed La Briere’s hand."
"“不过，这种灵活性会使一个人原谅自己自相矛盾的行为，尤其是在政治上。”","“That adaptability, however, leads a man to excuse himself in his own eyes for actions that are diametrically opposed to each other; above all, in politics.”"
"“啊，小姐，”此刻，卡那利正在用爱抚的语调回答莫黛斯特的一句揶揄，“请不要认为情绪多变会在任何程度上削弱情感的力量。诗人甚至要比其他人更需要坚定、忠诚的爱情。您一定不要忌妒那些被称作缪斯的女人。一个终日忙碌的男人，他的妻子是幸福的。如果您听到女人们抱怨自己那身无一官半职或因过于富有而无所事事的丈夫给她们带来了沉重的负担，那您就会明白，一位巴黎女人最大的幸福就是自由——即掌管自己家庭的权利。如今，我们作家以及身兼公职的人会把权利留给自己的妻子。我们不会沦落到实行小人物的那种暴政，我们有更有意义的事要做。如果我结婚了——我向您保证，就目前来说，这还是一个遥远的大灾难——我会希望的我妻子享受一位主妇所享受的精神自由，也许那才是她魅力的真正来源。”","“Ah, mademoiselle,” Canalis was at this moment saying, in a caressing voice, replying to a roguish remark of Modeste, “do not think that a multiplicity of emotions can in any way lessen the strength of feelings.Poets, even more than other men, must needs love with constancy and faith.You must not be jealous of what is called the Muse.Happy is the wife of a man whose days are occupied.If you heard the complaints of women who have to endure the burden of an idle husband, either a man without duties, or one so rich as to have nothing to do, you would know that the highest happiness of a Parisian wife is freedom,—the right to rule in her own home.Now we writers and men of functions and occupations, we leave the sceptre to our wives; we cannot descend to the tyranny of little minds; we have something better to do.If I ever marry,—which I assure you is a catastrophe very remote at the present moment,—I should wish my wife to enjoy the same moral freedom that a mistress enjoys, and which is perhaps the real source of her attraction.”"
"卡那利继续高谈阔论着，展示出他柔情的幻想和全部的风度，从莫黛斯特的利益出发，谈论着爱情、婚姻，以及对女人的崇拜，直到米尼翁先生重新回到他们这边，抓住一个小小停顿的机会，挽起女儿的手，把她带到了埃内斯特·德拉布里埃跟前。米尼翁先生刚才一直在建议拉布里埃试着向莫黛斯特开诚布公地解释一番。","Canalis talked on, displaying the warmth of his fancy and all his graces, for Modeste’s benefit, as he spoke of love, marriage, and the adoration of women, until Monsieur Mignon, who had rejoined them, seized the opportunity of a slight pause to take his daughter’s arm and lead her up to Ernest de La Briere, whom he had been advising to seek an open explanation with her."
"“小姐，”埃内斯特用一种几乎不是他自己的声音说道，“我再也无法承受您的不满给我带来的巨大压力了。我不想为自己辩解，也不会尝试证明自己的行为是对的。在您写给我的让我欣喜若狂的那封信中——也就是您的最后一封信，您已经不再是和诗人说话，而是在和您的意中人本人说话。我只想让您明白，在读到那封信之前，我就希望——而且我也曾在勒阿弗尔写给您的短笺中告诉过您——希望纠正我那个把您引向歧路的错误。我有幸对您表达的所有情感，都是真诚的。在巴黎，令尊大人告诉我他其实没那么富有时，一道希望之光降临到了我身上——但现在，一切都没了，现在，除了无尽的悔恨，我已经一无所有，我为什么还要呆在这尽是痛苦与折磨的地方呢？请让我带走一个微笑，让它永远活在我的心中吧。”","“Mademoiselle,” said Ernest, in a voice that was scarcely his own, “it is impossible for me to remain any longer under the weight of your displeasure.I do not defend myself; I do not seek to justify my conduct; I desire only to make you see that before reading your most flattering letter, addressed to the individual and no longer to the poet,—the last which you sent to me,—I wished, and I told you in my note written at Havre that I wished, to correct the error under which you were acting.All the feelings that I have had the happiness to express to you are sincere.A hope dawned on me in Paris when your father told me he was comparatively poor,—but now that all is lost, now that nothing is left for me but endless regrets, why should I stay here where all is torture?Let me carry away with me one smile to live forever in my heart.”"
"“先生，”莫黛斯特一副冷淡而又心不在焉的样子，回答道，“我不是这里的女主人，但强留一个在这里既找不到快乐也感受不到幸福的人，我当然也会深感遗憾。”","“Monsieur,” answered Modeste, who seemed cold and absent-minded, “I am not the mistress of this house; but I certainly should deeply regret to retain any one where he finds neither pleasure nor happiness.”"
"她离开了拉布里埃，挽着迪迈夫人的手，回到屋里去了。过了一会儿，这场家庭剧中所有的演员又都聚集在客厅里，而且，令人万分惊讶的是，莫黛斯特竟坐到了德埃鲁维尔公爵的旁边，并像一个颇善社交的巴黎女人一样向他卖弄风情。她看着他打牌，给他出他想要的建议，并不失时机地说一些奉承的话，将出身贵族的好处提到了同天才和美貌相当的高度。卡那利以为他知道此番变化的原因。他将婚姻称作大灾难，对结婚这件事表现得很冷淡，以此来刺激莫黛斯特，但是，跟其他玩火的人一样，他已经烧到自己的手指了。莫黛斯特的傲慢以及她现在的蔑视让他感到惊恐。他试图收复自己的阵地，于是表现出一副忌妒的模样，可因为这忌妒是装出来的，也就更显得引人注意。莫黛斯特像一位天使一样毫不留情，品尝着威力带来的乐趣，并且十分自然地滥用着威力。德埃鲁维尔公爵从未有过如此幸福的夜晚，一个女人朝他微笑了！十一点时，三位追求者起身告辞，还从未有客人在木屋呆到这么晚——公爵觉得莫黛斯特很迷人，卡那利觉得她过于卖弄风情，而拉布里埃则被她的残忍伤透了心。","She left La Briere and took Madame Dumay’s arm to re-enter the house.A few moments later all the actors in this domestic scene reassembled in the salon, and were a good deal surprised to see Modeste sitting beside the Duc d’Herouville and coquetting with him like an accomplished Parisian woman.She watched his play, gave him the advice he wanted, and found occasion to say flattering things by ranking the merits of noble birth with those of genius and beauty.Canalis thought he knew the reason of this change; he had tried to pique Modeste by calling marriage a catastrophe, and showing that he was aloof from it; but like others who play with fire, he had burned his fingers.Modeste’s pride and her present disdain frightened him, and he endeavored to recover his ground, exhibiting a jealousy which was all the more visible because it was artificial.Modeste, implacable as an angel, tasted the sweets of power, and, naturally enough, abused it.The Duc d’Herouville had never known such a happy evening; a woman smiled on him!At eleven o’clock, an unheard-of hour at the Chalet, the three suitors took their leave,—the duke thinking Modeste charming, Canalis believing her excessively coquettish, and La Briere heart-broken by her cruelty."
"连续八天，这位女嗣对她三位追求者的态度仍跟那天晚上一样，于是，尽管莫黛斯特的反常和善变时不时地给了德埃鲁维尔公爵一丝希望，但诗人看上去还是占了上风。莫黛斯特对父亲毫不恭敬，在他面前任性妄为，对失明的母亲也没了耐心，从前她以尽孝为乐，现在却好像不愿意服侍母亲似的——这似乎是任性的天性和从小被娇惯的结果。莫黛斯特做得太过分时，便又回过头来坦然地自责，将自己的鲁莽无礼和轻率归因于自主独立的性情。她告诉公爵和卡那利，说她不喜欢事事顺从，而且声称顺从是她婚姻的障碍，以此来探查她的追求者们的天性，就像那些挖洞找金属、煤矿、凝灰岩，或者水的人一样。","For eight days the heiress continued to be to her three lovers very much what she had been during that evening; so that the poet appeared to carry the day against his rivals, in spite of certain freaks and caprices which from time to time gave the Duc d’Herouville a little hope.The disrespect she showed to her father, and the great liberties she took with him; her impatience with her blind mother, to whom she seemed to grudge the little services which had once been the delight of her filial piety,—seemed the result of a capricious nature and a heedless gaiety indulged from childhood.When Modeste went too far, she turned round and openly took herself to task, ascribing her impertinence and levity to a spirit of independence.She acknowledged to the duke and Canalis her distaste for obedience, and professed to regard it as an obstacle to her marriage; thus investigating the nature of her suitors, after the manner of those who dig into the earth in search of metals, coal, tufa, or water."
"在莫黛斯特一家搬入公馆的前一天晚上，她说道：“我永远也找不到一个能像我父亲那样容忍我的任性的丈夫。父亲的慈爱是历久弥新的。我也确信没有一个人会像我心爱的母亲那样宽容我。“","“I shall never,” she said, the evening before the day on which the family were to move into the villa, “find a husband who will put up with my caprices as my father does; his kindness never flags.I am sure no one will ever be as indulgent to me as my precious mother.”"
"“他们知道您爱他们，小姐。”拉布里埃说。","“They know that you love them, mademoiselle,” said La Briere."
"“小姐，您可以放心，您的丈夫会懂得他这笔财富的全部价值。”公爵补充道。","“You may be very sure, mademoiselle, that your husband will know the full value of his treasure,” added the duke."
"“您的精神和决心足以让一个丈夫俯首听命。”卡那利笑着大声说道。","“You have spirit and resolution enough to discipline a husband,” cried Canalis, laughing."
"莫黛斯特微微一笑。因为一位外国使节的缘故，亨利四世曾借助一个狡猾问题的三种答案揭示其三位重臣的性格，之后他肯定也露出过这样的笑容。","Modeste smiled as Henri IV. must have smiled after drawing out the characters of his three principal ministers, for the benefit of a foreign ambassador, by means of three answers to an insidious question."
"晚宴的那一天，莫黛斯特受自己对卡那利的偏爱的驱使，同他单独在房屋和满是花床的草坪之间的沙石路上散步。从诗人的姿势和这位年轻女嗣的表情和动作上，很容易就能看出她正热情地听着卡那利的话。两位德埃鲁维尔小姐便马上去打断这令人反感的两人私谈，而且凭着这种处境下女人天生的聪明，将话题转移到了宫廷，以及王权下官衔的区别之上——指出国王内廷官衔和宫廷官衔的不同。她们试图通过迎合莫黛斯特的高傲，描绘一个女人能够追求的最高地位，来让她飘飘然。","On the day of the dinner, Modeste, led away by the preference she bestowed on Canalis, walked alone with him up and down the gravelled space which lay between the house and the lawn with its flower-beds.From the gestures of the poet, and the air and manner of the young heiress, it was easy to see that she was listening favorably to him.The two demoiselles d’Herouville hastened to interrupt the scandalous tete-a-tete; and with the natural cleverness of women under such circumstances, they turned the conversation on the court, and the distinction of an appointment under the crown,—pointing out the difference that existed between appointments in the household of the king and those of the crown.They tried to intoxicate Modeste’s mind by appealing to her pride, and describing one of the highest stations to which a woman could aspire."
"“有一个当公爵的儿子，”老德埃鲁维尔小姐说道，“是一个真正的优势。这个头衔就是我们能给孩子们的一笔万无一失的财富。”","“To have a duke for a son,” said the elder lady, “is an actual advantage.The title is a fortune that we secure to our children without the possibility of loss.”"
"“那么，”卡那利为他的二人私聊就这样被打断了而颇不高兴，便说道，“既然公爵先生的头衔看上去会对他有特殊帮助，为什么他在这件事上却没能取得重大成就呢？”","“How is it, then,” said Canalis, displeased at his tete-a-tete being thus broken in upon, “that Monsieur le duc has had so little success in a matter where his title would seem to be of special service to him?”"
"两位小姐瞪了卡那利一眼，那眼神就像毒蛇的牙齿一样满是毒液。看到莫黛斯特被逗笑了，两位小姐又变得慌张不已、无言以对了。","The two ladies cast a look at Canalis as full of venom as the tooth of a snake, and they were so disconcerted by Modeste’s amused smile that they were actually unable to reply."
"“公爵先生从未因为您有名气而又谦卑而指责您，”莫黛斯特对卡那利说，“您又为什么要抨击他的谦逊呢？”","“Monsieur le duc has never blamed you,” she said to Canalis, “for the humility with which you bear your fame; why should you attack him for his modesty?”"
"“再说，我们还从未碰到过一个能与我侄子的地位相配的女子，”德埃鲁维尔小姐说，“有的女子只是财富与这个地位相称，有的女子才智过人、出身高贵，却没有财富。我们一直等着上帝赐予我们机会，碰到一位血统高贵、有思想又有财富的德埃鲁维尔公爵夫人，我必须承认我们算是等对了。”","“Besides, we have never yet met a woman worthy of my nephew’s rank,” said Mademoiselle d’Herouville.“Some had only the wealth of the position; others, without fortune, had the wit and birth.I must admit that we have done well to wait till God granted us an opportunity to meet one in whom we find the noble blood, the mind, and fortune of a Duchesse d’Herouville.”"
"“我亲爱的莫黛斯特，”埃莱娜·德埃鲁维尔将她的新朋友带到一边，说，“法兰西王国有上千个男爵，正如巴黎有上百个能与他相提并论的诗人。他才不算什么大人物呢，就连我这个因为没有嫁妆而被迫去当修女的可怜姑娘，都不会看上他。您是不知道，一个被德肖利厄公爵夫人控制了十年的年轻人会是个什么样子。除了一个六十岁老太太，恐怕没有别人受得了这位伟大诗人的那些小毛病，据说他还总是对此抱怨不休——他的习惯在路易十四看来已经变得令人难以忍受了。真的，他的妻子遭的罪会比公爵夫人还多，因为他会一直呆在妻子身边。”","“My dear Modeste,” said Helene d’Herouville, leading her new friend apart, “there are a thousand barons in the kingdom, just as there are a hundred poets in Paris, who are worth as much as he; he is so little of a great man that even I, a poor girl forced to take the veil for want of a ‘dot,’ I would not take him.You don’t know what a young man is who has been for ten years in the hands of a Duchesse de Chaulieu.None but an old woman of sixty could put up with the little ailments of which, they say, the great poet is always complaining,—a habit in Louis XIV. that became a perfectly insupportable annoyance.It is true the duchess does not suffer from it as much as a wife, who would have him always about her.”"
"接着，埃莱娜·德埃鲁维尔便施展了一种众所周知的女人特有的花招，将对德肖利厄公爵夫人心怀嫉妒的女人们常常散布的、关于诗人的所有诽谤都低声说了一遍。这个小插曲在女人间的谈话中是很常见的，它将告诉我们，追求者们是怎样激烈地争夺莫黛斯特的财产的。","Then, practising a well-known manoeuvre peculiar to her sex, Helene d’Herouville repeated in a low voice all the calumnies which women jealous of the Duchesse de Chaulieu were in the habit of spreading about the poet.This little incident, common as it is in the intercourse of women, will serve to show with what fury the hounds were after Modeste’s wealth."
"十天之中，对于德拉巴斯蒂小姐的三位追求者，木屋的人们的看法也大有变化。这种变化对卡那利十分不利，它出自对人的本性的思考，任何名人都应该为此停下来反思。如果我们记得人们追求签名的热情，那就没人能否认，公众的好奇心是被名声大大地激发起来的。很明显，在大多数外省人的头脑里，对于巴黎名人怎样打领带、怎样走在林荫大道上、怎样目中无人地站在那里，或者怎样吃肉排，从来都没有形成一个确切的认识，因为他们一旦看到一个穿着时髦，或者名噪一时（尽管总是令人羡慕的）的人物，他们就会叫道：“快看啊！”“真古怪！”继而发出一连串蔑视的惊呼声。总之，任何一种名气，哪怕是适得其所的名气，它所带来的神秘魅力都不会持久。尤其是对那些好忌妒或者好挖苦人的肤浅之人来说，这只是一种闪电般转瞬即逝、永不再来的感觉。这样看来，名声就像太阳一样，从远处看是火热光亮的，而当你靠近它时，却发现它像山巅一样冰冷。也许，一个人只有对他的同类人来说才是真正伟大的，也许，他身上固有的缺陷在同类人的眼中，会比在那些庸俗的崇拜者眼中消失得更快。一位诗人如果想在平常生活中讨人喜欢，就要摆出各种虚假的风度，就像那些善于用彬彬有礼的举止和讨人喜欢的言语掩盖自己卑劣品质的人一样。这位圣日耳曼近郊的诗人，没有选择在这条社会公理面前低头，不久，他便感觉到一种外省人的无礼冷漠已经代替了前几个晚上那种盲目的迷恋。过度卖弄才华和智慧，对这些可敬的心灵产生的影响，就和满店的玻璃制品对眼睛产生的效果差不多。换句话说，卡那利热情机智的能言善辩很快就让人们感到厌倦，用他们自己的话来说，他们“更关注实实在在的东西。”","Ten days saw a great change in the opinions at the Chalet as to the three suitors for Mademoiselle de La Bastie’s hand.This change, which was much to the disadvantage of Canalis, came about through considerations of a nature which ought to make the holders of any kind of fame pause, and reflect.No one can deny, if we remember the passion with which people seek for autographs, that public curiosity is greatly excited by celebrity.Evidently most provincials never form an exact idea in their own minds of how illustrious Parisians put on their cravats, walk on the boulevards, stand gaping at nothing, or eat a cutlet; because, no sooner do they perceive a man clothed in the sunbeams of fashion or resplendent with some dignity that is more or less fugitive (though always envied), than they cry out, “Look at that!” “How queer!” and other depreciatory exclamations.In a word, the mysterious charm that attaches to every kind of fame, even that which is most justly due, never lasts.It is, and especially with superficial people who are envious or sarcastic, a sensation which passes off with the rapidity of lightning, and never returns.It would seem as though fame, like the sun, hot and luminous at a distance, is cold as the summit of an alp when you approach it.Perhaps man is only really great to his peers; perhaps the defects inherent in his constitution disappear sooner to the eyes of his equals than to those of vulgar admirers.A poet, if he would please in ordinary life, must put on the fictitious graces of those who are able to make their insignificances forgotten by charming manners and complying speeches.The poet of the faubourg Saint-Germain, who did not choose to bow before this social dictum, was made before long to feel that an insulting provincial indifference had succeeded to the dazed fascination of the earlier evenings.The prodigality of his wit and wisdom had produced upon these worthy souls somewhat the effect which a shopful of glass-ware produces on the eye; in other words, the fire and brilliancy of Canalis’s eloquence soon wearied people who, to use their own words, “cared more for the solid.”"
"诗人很快就被迫表现得跟常人一样，碰到了意想不到的绊脚石。而拉布里埃在同一块地盘上，则已经赢得了那些开始认为他很沉闷的可敬之人的选票。他们觉得需要通过偏爱名人的朋友，来对自己进行补偿。心地最善良的人们会被这样的想法所影响。这位淳朴、率直的年轻人没有伤害过任何人的自尊。他们更深入地了解他之后，便发现他心地善良、谦恭礼让、沉默安静、处事谨慎，而且很有教养。德埃鲁维尔公爵从政治角度考虑，认为拉布里埃远在卡那利之上。诗人性情多变、野心勃勃，像塔索一样焦躁不安，他喜欢奢侈、豪华，还欠了债；而年轻的律师则性情温和、生活节制，乐于助人且不张扬，期待回报却不乞求回报，而且还存有积蓄。","Forced after a while to behave like an ordinary man, the poet found an unexpected stumbling-block on ground where La Briere had already won the suffrage of the worthy people who at first had thought him sulky.They felt the need of compensating themselves for Canalis’s reputation by preferring his friend.The best of men are influenced by such feelings as these.The simple and straightforward young fellow jarred no one’s self-love; coming to know him better they discovered his heart, his modesty, his silent and sure discretion, and his excellent bearing.The Duc d’Herouville considered him, as a political element, far above Canalis.The poet, ill-balanced, ambitious, and restless as Tasso, loved luxury, grandeur, and ran into debt; while the young lawyer, whose character was equable and well-balanced, lived soberly, was useful without proclaiming it, awaited rewards without begging for them, and laid by his money."
"而且，卡那利还以一种特殊的方式向那些观察着他的中产阶级们展示自己。这两三天来，他已经表现出不耐烦的样子，流露出沮丧的神情，陷入了看上去毫无理由的忧郁状态，以及诗人们的神经质自然而然导致的那些情绪波动。这些怪里怪气（我们用的是外省字眼）是他的不安造成的，他感觉随着时间的流逝，越来越无法向德肖利厄夫人解释他的所作所为了。他知道应该给她写封信，但就是下不了决心。所有的这些情绪波动，都被温和的美国女子和高尚的拉图奈尔夫人细心地观察和评论着，她们不止一次地同米尼翁夫人谈论过这个话题。卡那利感觉到了这些谈论的影响，但却无法对其进行解释。大家对他的态度变了，周围人的脸上也不再有前几天那种着迷的表情了，而与此同时，埃内斯特显然正在被人们所接受。","Canalis had moreover laid himself open in a special way to the bourgeois eyes that were watching him.For two or three days he had shown signs of impatience; he had given way to depression, to states of melancholy without apparent reason, to those capricious changes of temper which are the natural results of the nervous temperament of poets.These originalities (we use the provincial word) came from the uneasiness that his conduct toward the Duchesse de Chaulieu which grew daily less explainable, caused him.He knew he ought to write to her, but could not resolve on doing so.All these fluctuations were carefully remarked and commented on by the gentle American, and the excellent Madame Latournelle, and they formed the topic of many a discussion between these two ladies and Madame Mignon.Canalis felt the effects of these discussions without being able to explain them.The attention paid to him was not the same, the faces surrounding him no longer wore the entranced look of the earlier days; while at the same time Ernest was evidently gaining ground."
"在过去两天里，诗人只极力引诱莫黛斯特一个人，并且利用每一个跟她独处的时刻，在他心爱的人周围用热烈的情话编织罗网。莫黛斯特满面娇羞地听着这些不着边际的甜言蜜语，喜悦之情在两位德埃鲁维尔小姐一展无遗。两位小姐看到这种情形，极其不安，便马上使出女人在这种情况下常用的“ultima ratio”，也即污蔑诽谤，这种污蔑诽谤往往是很有成效的。因此，大家都入席就餐时，诗人看到他的偶像眉宇间乌云密布。他知道德埃鲁维尔小姐的狠毒不容许他浪费任何时间，便决定一找到机会同莫黛斯特单独在一起，便马上自荐做她的丈夫。","For the last two days the poet had endeavored to fascinate Modeste only, and he took advantage of every moment when he found himself alone with her, to weave the web of passionate language around his love.Modeste’s blush, as she listened to him on the occasion we have just mentioned, showed the demoiselles d’Herouville the pleasure with which she was listening to sweet conceits that were sweetly said; and they, horribly uneasy at the sight, had immediate recourse to the “ultima ratio” of women in such cases, namely, those calumnies which seldom miss their object.Accordingly, when the party met at the dinner-table the poet saw a cloud on the brow of his idol; he knew that Mademoiselle d’Herouville’s malignity allowed him to lose no time, and he resolved to offer himself as a husband at the first moment when he could find himself alone with Modeste."
"哥本海姆无意中听到了几句诗人同这两位贵族小姐之间看似礼貌、实则刻薄的谈话，便用胳膊肘轻轻推了推比查，指着诗人和马厩大总管，颇有深意地说道——","Overhearing a few acid though polite remarks exchanged between the poet and the two noble ladies, Gobenheim nudged Butscha with his elbow, and said in an undertone, motioning towards the poet and the grand equerry,—"
"“他们要互相拆台了！”","“They’ll demolish one another!”"
"“卡那利才华过人，足以亲手拆自己的台。”小矮人回答说。","“Canalis has genius enough to demolish himself all alone,” answered the dwarf."
"第二十二章 谜底揭晓","Chapter XXII A Riddle Guessed"
"晚宴十分丰盛，招待得极为周到。席间，公爵又明显较卡那利占了上风。莫黛斯特前一天晚上刚刚收到她的骑装和其他骑马装备，便说到骑马外出郊游。说着说着，就提到了她想看看围猎，这是她到目前为止还没享受过的乐趣。公爵立刻提议为她在离勒阿弗尔几里格远的皇家森林里准备一次围猎。他想靠着他同猎队长德卡迪央亲王的亲密关系，借机向莫黛斯特展现一个皇家般的盛大排场，让她一窥宫廷生活的诱人之处，引诱她通过和他结婚来得到这一切。公爵和他的两位德埃鲁维尔小姐互相交换了眼神，明摆着是在说：“女嗣是我们的了！”诗人觉察到了他们的眼神，便更加笃定他必须马上得到某种情感上的保证，因为他只剩下个人的名声可依靠了。另一方面，莫黛斯特见德埃鲁维尔一家的决定超出了她的打算，几乎被吓到了。饭后，大家一起到花园里散步，她很明显地跟梅尔基奥尔保持着距离。出于完全可以理解的少女的好奇心，她故意让卡那利怀疑埃莱娜是不是在她面前说了什么毁谤的话。但看到卡那利发怒了，她便请求他只字不提那些话，他也答应了。","During the dinner, which was magnificent and admirably well served, the duke obtained a signal advantage over Canalis.Modeste, who had received her habit and other equestrian equipments the night before, spoke of taking rides about the country.A turn of the conversation led her to express the wish to see a hunt with hounds, a pleasure she had never yet enjoyed.The duke at once proposed to arrange a hunt in one of the crown forests, which lay a few leagues from Havre.Thanks to his intimacy with the Prince de Cadignan, Master of the Hunt, he saw his chance of displaying an almost regal pomp before Modeste’s eyes, and alluring her with a glimpse of court fascinations, to which she could be introduced by marriage.Glances were exchanged between the duke and the two demoiselles d’Herouville, which plainly said, “The heiress is ours!” and the poet, who detected them, and who had nothing but his personal splendors to depend on, determined all the more firmly to obtain some pledge of affection at once.Modeste, on the other hand, half-frightened at being thus pushed beyond her intentions by the d’Herouvilles, walked rather markedly apart with Melchior, when the company adjourned to the park after dinner.With the pardonable curiosity of a young girl, she let him suspect the calumnies which Helene had poured into her ears; but on Canalis’s exclamation of anger, she begged him to keep silence about them, which he promised."
"“这些恶语中伤，”他说，“在上流社会被认为是公平的。您生性正直，因而为它们感到惊讶，可我却对它们嗤之以鼻，甚至感到高兴。这两位小姐肯定是觉得公爵的利益面临极大的威胁，才会出此下策。”","“These stabs of the tongue,” he said, “are considered fair in the great world.They shock your upright nature; but as for me, I laugh at them; I am even pleased.These ladies must feel that the duke’s interests are in great peril, when they have recourse to such warfare.”"
"卡那利最大限度地利用了莫黛斯特给他的优势，一面感谢莫黛斯特给了他信任，让他贸然从中窥到了爱情的曙光，一面用热情、殷切以及巧妙地表露出的激情来为自己辩护。这样一来，莫黛斯特发现自己突然向诗人妥协了，正如她害怕自己会向马厩大总管妥协那样。卡那利感觉有必要立即行动，便直接表白了。他吐出各种山盟海誓，言语中透着应景的诗意，像一轮明月般光芒四射。他用了大量典故，盛赞心上人的美貌，以及她晚礼服的亮丽。这位急切的情人无所不用其极，借用了夜色、树叶、天空、大地，乃至大自然本身，来粉饰这伪装的激情。他大谈特谈自己的公正无私，还用自己优美的风格，将狄德罗著名的感叹“索菲和一千五百法郎！”以及说烂了的“草屋里的爱情”翻新了一遍。这是每一个对岳父的财产了如指掌的情人都会的一套。","Making the most of the advantage Modeste had thus given him, Canalis entered upon his defence with such warmth, such eagerness, and with a passion so exquisitely expressed, as he thanked her for a confidence in which he could venture to see the dawn of love, that she found herself suddenly as much compromised with the poet as she feared to be with the grand equerry.Canalis, feeling the necessity of prompt action, declared himself plainly.He uttered vows and protestations in which his poetry shone like a moon, invoked for the occasion, and illuminating his allusions to the beauty of his mistress and the charms of her evening dress.This counterfeit enthusiasm, in which the night, the foliage, the heavens and the earth, and Nature herself played a part, carried the eager lover beyond all bounds; for he dwelt on his disinterestedness, and revamped in his own charming style, Diderot’s famous apostrophe to “Sophie and fifteen hundred francs!” and the well-worn “love in a cottage” of every lover who knows perfectly well the length of the father-inlaw’s purse."
"“先生，”莫黛斯特高兴地听完这部旋律优美的协奏曲后，说道，“我父母赋予我自由，使我能够倾听您的心声，但这件事您必须得跟他们谈。”","“Monsieur,” said Modeste, after listening with delight to the melody of this concerto; “the freedom granted to me by my parents has allowed me to listen to you; but it is to them that you must address yourself.”"
"“不过，”卡那利大叫道，“请告诉我，如果我得到他们的认同，您就会乖乖地听从他们的话。”","“But,” exclaimed Canalis, “tell me that if I obtain their consent, you will ask nothing better than to obey them.”"
"“我之前就知道，”她回答说，“我的父亲有些古怪想法，可能会伤到您这样一个古老家族应有的自豪感。他希望由他的外孙们继承他的头衔和姓氏。”","“I know beforehand,” she replied, “that my father has certain fancies which may wound the proper pride of an old family like yours.He wishes to have his own title and name borne by his grandsons.”"
"“啊！亲爱的莫黛斯特，为了将我的生命交给像您这样的天使去守护，我还有什么不能牺牲的呢。”","“Ah! dear Modeste, what sacrifices would I not make to commit my life to the guardian care of an angel like you.”"
"“请您原谅我，不能在顷刻间就对自己一生的命运作出决定。”她说着，便走回两位德埃鲁维尔小姐那边去了。","“You will permit me not to decide in a moment the fate of my whole life,” she said, turning to rejoin the demoiselles d’Herouville."
"那两位贵族小姐正在拍小个子拉图奈尔的马屁，企图赢得他的支持，以保护她们的利益。为了将老德埃鲁维尔小姐同她的侄女埃莱娜区别开来，我们以后就用姓氏来称呼她了。她暗示公证人，查理十世说不定会在她的请求下将勒阿弗尔高级法院的法官一职赏给他，而他的法律才能和众所周知的正直使他完全配得上这一职位。此时，一直走在拉布里埃身边的比查对于卡那利取得的显著进展感到十分惊慌。当所有人又回到屋里，去忍受那必不可少的惠斯特牌的折磨时，他在门廊的台阶下拦住了莫黛斯特。","Those noble ladies were just then engaged in flattering the vanity of little Latournelle, intending to win him over to their interests.Mademoiselle d’Herouville, to whom we shall in future confine the family name, to distinguish her from her niece Helene, was giving the notary to understand that the post of judge of the Supreme Court in Havre, which Charles X. would bestow as she desired, was an office worthy of his legal talent and his well-known probity.Butscha, meanwhile, who had been walking about with La Briere, was greatly alarmed at the progress Canalis was evidently making, and he waylaid Modeste at the lower step of the portico when the whole party returned to the house to endure the torments of their inevitable whist."
"“小姐，”他低声说道，“我真希望您没有称呼他为梅尔基奥尔。”","“Mademoiselle,” he said, in a low whisper, “I do hope you don’t call him Melchior.”"
"“很接近了，我的黑侏儒。”她微笑着说道，那微笑都能使一个天使骂人。","“I’m very near it, my Black Dwarf,” she said, with a smile that might have made an angel swear."
"“天哪！”比查大叫一声，双手垂下，砸在了大理石台阶上。","“Good God!” exclaimed Butscha, letting fall his hands, which struck the marble steps."
"“怎么！难道他还比不上那个居心不良、面色阴沉的秘书吗？你对那秘书倒挺感兴趣。”她反驳道。一想到埃内斯特，她便摆出一副高傲的姿态，其中奥妙只有少女们才懂——好像她们的贞洁给了她们飞向天堂的翅膀。“请问，你的小拉布里埃会接受我，而不要任何财产吗？”她停顿了一会儿，说道。","“Well! and isn’t he worth more than that spiteful and gloomy secretary in whom you take such an interest?” she retorted, assuming, at the mere thought of Ernest, the haughty manner whose secret belongs exclusively to young girls,—as if their virginity lent them wings to fly to heaven.“Pray, would your little La Briere accept me without a fortune?” she said, after a pause."
"“您问您父亲吧。”比查回答说，他走了几步，将莫黛斯特带到离窗户远些的地方，防止别人听到，“请听我说，小姐。您知道，现在跟您说话的这个人，他一直都准备着随时将他的生命、还有他的荣誉都献给您。因此，您可以信任他，有些话您可能不愿意跟您父亲讲，但可以跟他讲。请告诉我，那个伟大的卡那利是不是跟您说了不在乎财产的话，所以您现在用这话来责备可怜的埃内斯特？”","“Ask your father,” replied Butscha, who walked a few steps from the house, to get Modeste at a safe distance from the windows.“Listen to me, mademoiselle.You know that he who speaks to you is ready to give not only his life but his honor for you, at any moment, and at all times.Therefore you may believe in him; you can confide to him that which you may not, perhaps, be willing to say to your father.Tell me, has that sublime Canalis been making you the disinterested offer that you now fling as a reproach at poor Ernest?”"
"“是的。”","“Yes.”"
"“您相信他说的吗？”","“Do you believe it?”"
"“我的小矮人，”她从给他起的一二十个外号中拣了一个称呼他，回答说，“你这么问，让我觉得你是低估了我自尊心的强度。”","“That question, my manikin,” she replied, giving him one of the ten or a dozen nicknames she had invented for him, “strikes me as undervaluing the strength of my self-love.”"
"“啊，您笑了，我亲爱的莫黛斯特小姐。那就没什么危险了，我希望您只是在耍他。”","“Ah, you are laughing, my dear Mademoiselle Modeste; then there’s no danger: I hope you are only making a fool of him.”"
"“比查先生，如果我任由自己玩弄那些赏脸想娶我为妻的人，请告诉我，你又会怎样看待我呢？让老爷，你应该知道，即使一个女孩子装作看不起那些最卑劣的殷勤，她还是会为之感到高兴。”","“Pray what would you think of me, Monsieur Butscha, if I allowed myself to make fun of those who do me the honor to wish to marry me?You ought to know, master Jean, that even if a girl affects to despise the most despicable attentions, she is flattered by them.”"
"“那么，我让您高兴了？”这位年轻人说道。他抬头看着她，脸庞像是一座欢庆节日的城市那样光彩四溢。","“Then I flatter you?” said the young man, looking up at her with a face that was illuminated like a city for a festival."
"“你？”她说，“你给我的是最宝贵的友谊——是一种像母亲对孩子那样的无私情感。不要把你跟任何人相比，因为就连我的父亲对我的奉献，也是出于义务啊。”她停了停。“从男人们赋予‘爱’这个词的意义来说，我不能说我爱你，但我对你的感情是永恒的，而且永远都不会改变。”","“You?” she said; “you give me the most precious of all friendships,—a feeling as disinterested as that of a mother for her child.Compare yourself to no one; for even my father is obliged to be devoted to me.”She paused.“I cannot say that I love you, in the sense which men give to that word, but what I do give you is eternal and can know no change.”"
"“那么，”比查弯下腰去捡一块卵石，以便亲吻她的衣角，“请允许我像一条龙守卫宝藏那样照看您吧。诗人刚才正在用花边般矫揉造作的语言和华而不实的承诺蒙蔽您，他拨弄七弦琴最动听的琴弦，来歌颂自己的爱情，我知道他是这么做的。这位高贵的情人，一旦他知道您的财富多么地少，便会突然翻脸，变得冷淡而窘迫，如果是这样，您还会嫁给他吗？您还会敬重他吗？”","“Then,” said Butscha, stooping to pick up a pebble that he might kiss the hem of her garment, “suffer me to watch over you as a dragon guards a treasure.The poet was covering you just now with the lace-work of his precious phrases, the tinsel of his promises; he chanted his love on the best strings of his lyre, I know he did.If, as soon as this noble lover finds out how small your fortune is, he makes a sudden change in his behavior, and is cold and embarrassed, will you still marry him? shall you still esteem him?”"
"“那他就是另一个弗朗西斯克·阿尔图。”她做了一个恶心厌恶的手势，说道。","“He would be another Francisque Althor,” she said, with a gesture of bitter disgust."
"“请让我来找找乐，安排这出斗转星移的戏吧。”比查说，“这出戏会来得很突然，而且我相信，我还能让它倒流，让您的诗人像以前那样爱您——不但如此，我还能让他轮番往您的心头送热气和泼冷水，就像他整个晚上都在温文尔雅地谈论一个论点的两面、却无法看穿问题那样。”","“Let me have the pleasure of producing that change of scene,” said Butscha.“Not only shall it be sudden, but I believe I can change it back and make your poet as loving as before,—nay, it is possible to make him blow alternately hot and cold upon your heart, just as gracefully as he has talked on both sides of an argument in one evening without ever finding it out.”"
"“如果你是对的，”她说，“那我该相信谁？”","“If you are right,” she said, “who can be trusted?”"
"“相信真正爱您的人。”","“One who truly loves you.”"
"“小公爵？”","“The little duke?”"
"比查看了莫黛斯特一眼。两个人默不作声地走了一段路。没有人能猜透这位少女的心思，她连睫毛都不眨一下。","Butscha looked at Modeste.The pair walked some distance in silence; the girl was impenetrable and not an eyelash quivered."
"“小姐，请允许我说明您内心深处的想法吧，它们如同波涛下的海藻，而您没有选择将它们收拾收拾。”","“Mademoiselle, permit me to be the exponent of the thoughts that are lying at the bottom of your heart like sea-mosses under the waves, and which you do not choose to gather up.”"
"“呃？”莫黛斯特说，“这么说，我的密友兼顾问认为自己是一面镜子，对吗？”","“Eh!” said Modeste, “so my intimate friend and counsellor thinks himself a mirror, does he?”"
"“不，是回声。”他打了一个极为谦卑的手势，说道，“公爵爱您，但爱得太过了。把您像一位圣女似的放在神龛里供着，会让您反感的——如果我这个小矮人猜对了您细如发丝的心思的话。您是一位非凡的女子，您既不想找一个可以永远对他放心、一生伏在您脚下的男人，也不想找一个像卡那利那样，总是爱自己甚于爱您的自私自利之人。为什么呢？啊，我不知道。但我会让自己变成一个女人，一个老女人，找出我从您眼中看出的这个计划的意图，也许这个计划蕴藏在每个少女心中。尽管如此，在您伟大的心灵深处，您觉得自己需要崇拜别人。当一个男人向您下跪时，您就不能向他下跪了。正如伏尔泰所言，那样的话您就无法前行。小个子公爵在精神方面卑躬屈膝的地方太多，而诗人却又太少——事实上，可以说是一点儿都没有。哈，我已经猜到了您跟马厩大总管说话、以及回答他的问话时，微笑当中的淘气意味。您跟公爵在一起，永远都不会不高兴，而且如果您真的选择了他，每个人都会赞同您的选择。但您永远都不会爱他。自我主义的冷漠和欣喜若狂的热情，会激起每个女人心中的不屑。在我看来，很明显这种永恒的崇拜不会给您带来您所期待的婚姻中的无限乐趣——在您的婚姻里，您会以顺从为骄傲，会偷偷作出一点一滴高贵的牺牲。您的内心会无缘无故充满焦虑，在热切的期望中等待成功的到来。每一次宽宏大量对您而言都是快乐的，男女双方能够理解彼此内心深处的想法，男人保护女人，女人也用爱保护男人。”","“No, an echo,” he answered, with a gesture of sublime humility.“The duke loves you, but he loves you too much.If I, a dwarf, have understood the infinite delicacy of your heart, it would be repugnant to you to be worshipped like a saint in her shrine.You are eminently a woman; you neither want a man perpetually at your feet of whom you are eternally sure, nor a selfish egoist like Canalis, who will always prefer himself to you.Why? ah, that I don’t know.But I will make myself a woman, an old woman, and find out the meaning of the plan which I have read in your eyes, and which perhaps is in the heart of every girl.Nevertheless, in your great soul you feel the need of worshipping.When a man is at your knees, you cannot put yourself at his.You can’t advance in that way, as Voltaire might say.The little duke has too many genuflections in his moral being and the poet has too few,—indeed, I might say, none at all.Ha, I have guessed the mischief in your smiles when you talk to the grand equerry, and when he talks to you and you answer him.You would never be unhappy with the duke, and everybody will approve your choice, if you do choose him; but you will never love him.The ice of egotism, and the burning heat of ecstasy both produce indifference in the heart of every woman.It is evident to my mind that no such perpetual worship will give you the infinite delights which you are dreaming of in marriage,—in some marriage where obedience will be your pride, where noble little sacrifices can be made and hidden, where the heart is full of anxieties without a cause, and successes are awaited with eager hope, where each new chance for magnanimity is hailed with joy, where souls are comprehended to their inmost recesses, and where the woman protects with her love the man who protects her.”"
"“你真是个巫师啊！”莫黛斯特惊呼道。","“You are a sorcerer!” exclaimed Modeste."
"“那种情感上的甜蜜平等，那种对彼此生命的不断分享，那种足以维系婚姻的肯定的快乐，您在卡那利身上都不会找到。他是一个只会考虑自己的人，‘自我’是他诗琴的唯一琴弦，他的注意力都集中在自己身上，到目前为止，都不曾关心过您的父亲或公爵。他是一个有着二流野心的人，您的尊严和奉献，对他来说都无关紧要，他只会把您当作家里的一件附属品，而且他对您行为的漠视已经侮辱了您。是的，即使您斗胆打您母亲耳光，卡那利也会视而不见，甚至会在心中暗暗否认您的罪行，因为他渴望得到您的财产。所以，小姐，当我说到真正爱您的人时，我想的不是那位伟大的诗人，他只是一个小小的滑稽演员罢了，也不是那位公爵，您嫁给他，可能会是一桩好婚事，但他绝不是个好丈夫——”","“Neither will you find that sweet equality of feeling, that continual sharing of each other’s life, that certainty of pleasing which makes marriage tolerable, if you take Canalis,—a man who thinks of himself only, whose ‘I’ is the one string to his lute, whose mind is so fixed on himself that he has hitherto taken no notice of your father or the duke,—a man of second-rate ambitions, to whom your dignity and your devotion will matter nothing, who will make you a mere appendage to his household, and who already insults you by his indifference to your behavior; yes, if you permitted yourself to go so far as to box your mother’s ears Canalis would shut his eyes to it, and deny your crime even to himself, because he thirsts for your money.And so, mademoiselle, when I spoke of the man who truly loves you I was not thinking of the great poet who is nothing but a little comedian, nor of the duke, who might be a good marriage for you, but never a husband—”"
"“比查，我的心是一张白纸，你正在上面亲手写下刚刚这一切，”莫黛斯特打断了他，喊道，“你被外省人的仇恨主宰了，一切你不得不抬头仰望的事物，你都憎恶。一个诗人当政治家，拥有演讲的天赋，还有一番光明的前程，这些你都不能饶恕——而且你还污蔑他的意图。”","“Butscha, my heart is a blank page on which you are yourself writing all that you read there,” cried Modeste, interrupting him.“You are carried away by your provincial hatred for everything that obliges you to look higher than your own head.You can’t forgive a poet for being a statesman, for possessing the gift of speech, for having a noble future before him,—and you calumniate his intentions.”"
"“他的意图！——小姐，他很快就会用阿尔图式的卑鄙对您不理不睬的。”","“His!—mademoiselle, he will turn his back upon you with the baseness of an Althor.”"
"“那就让他上演那出精彩的小喜剧吧，还有——”","“Make him play that pretty little comedy, and—”"
"“我会的！三天后，他一定会将它一幕幕上演的——星期三——请记住，星期三！在那之前，小姐，您就听着七弦琴的小调调自娱自乐吧，让那些刺耳的和弦和错误的音符展露无遗吧。”","“That I will! he shall play it through and through within three days,—on Wednesday,—recollect, Wednesday!Until then, mademoiselle, amuse yourself by listening to the little tunes of the lyre, so that the discords and the false notes may come out all the more distinctly.”"
"莫黛斯特高高兴兴地跑回到客厅里。拉布里埃正坐在窗户边，毫无疑问一直在注视着他的偶像。看到她进来，他立刻站了起来，好像王室侍从突然报告“王后驾到”一样。那是一种无意识的尊敬之举，行动之间充满了鲜活的说服力，甚至比语言更令人信服。口头的爱情是无法与爱情的行动相比的，而且每个二十岁的少女在运用这条公理时，都有着五十岁人的智慧。它里面包含着吸引力的巨大秘密。这位被忽略的情人没有像卡那利那样，当众向莫黛斯特表达爱意。他没有注视她的脸庞，而是眼帘低垂，偷偷用目光追随着她，那目光跟比查的一样，谦卑而近乎胆怯。这位年轻的女嗣坐到卡那利旁边，开始看他打牌。这时，她注意到了拉布里埃的目光。在接下来的谈话中，拉布里埃听到莫黛斯特对她父亲说下个星期三她要第一次骑马出去，她还提醒父亲，她缺少一条马鞭来配她的新装备。这位年轻人快速地朝小矮人看了一眼，几分钟后，他们俩便在露台上踱起了步。","Modeste ran gaily back to the salon, where La Briere, who was sitting by the window, where he had doubtless been watching his idol, rose to his feet as if a groom of the chambers had suddenly announced, “The Queen.”It was a movement of spontaneous respect, full of that living eloquence that lies in gesture even more than in speech.Spoken love cannot compare with acts of love; and every young girl of twenty has the wisdom of fifty in applying the axiom.In it lies the great secret of attraction.Instead of looking Modeste in the face, as Canalis who paid her public homage would have done, the neglected lover followed her with a furtive look between his eyelids, humble after the manner of Butscha, and almost timid.The young heiress observed it, as she took her place by Canalis, to whose game she proceeded to pay attention.During a conversation which ensued, La Briere heard Modeste say to her father that she should ride out for the first time on the following Wednesday; and she also reminded him that she had no whip in keeping with her new equipments.The young man flung a lightning glance at the dwarf, and a few minutes later the two were pacing the terrace."
"“现在九点，”埃内斯特激动地说，“我立刻快马加鞭去巴黎，明天上午十点就能到那儿。我亲爱的比查，她很喜欢你，你送她什么她都会接受的。让我以你的名义送她一条马鞭吧。如果你愿意帮我这个大忙，那你将不仅拥有我的友情，还会拥有我的忠诚。”","“It is nine o’clock,” cried Ernest.“I shall start for Paris at full gallop; I can get there tomorrow morning by ten.My dear Butscha, from you she will accept anything, for she is attached to you; let me give her a riding-whip in your name.If you will do me this immense kindness, you shall have not only my friendship but my devotion.”"
"“啊，你真够幸福的，”比查悲伤地说道，“你有钱！”","“Ah, you are very happy,” said Butscha, ruefully; “you have money, you!”"
"“请告诉卡那利不要等我，并让他为我的离开找个托词。”","“Tell Canalis not to expect me, and that he must find some pretext to account for my absence.”"
"一小时后，埃内斯特已经乘车离开了勒阿弗尔。十二个小时后他便到了巴黎，到达后的第一件事便是在第二天晚上去勒阿弗尔的邮车上预定一个座位。然后他便去了巴黎三家主要的珠宝店，将他们所能提供的所有马鞭握柄加以比较。他要找到那种王室宝藏般精良的艺术品。他最后找到了一把马鞭握柄，是斯蒂曼为一个俄国女人做的，但做好后她却付不起钱——上面有一只黄金雕刻的狐狸头，镶着一颗价值不菲的红宝石。他把所有的积蓄都用来买这把价值七千法郎的马鞭握柄了。埃内斯特还把拉巴斯蒂家徽的图样给了店家，让他们在二十小时内刻在握柄上。这只握柄算是一件做工精良的杰作了，它被安到橡胶马鞭上，装进一个用天鹅绒做衬里的摩洛哥山羊皮包装盒里，盒子上还用烫金字印着两个交错在一起的M。","An hour later Ernest had ridden out of Havre.He reached Paris in twelve hours, where his first act was to secure a place in the mail-coach for Havre on the following evening.Then he went to three of the chief jewellers in Paris and compared all the whip-handles that they could offer; he was in search of some artistic treasure that was regally superb.He found one at last, made by Stidmann for a Russian, who was unable to pay for it when finished,—a fox-head in gold, with a ruby of exorbitant value; all his savings went into the purchase, the cost of which was seven thousand francs.Ernest gave a drawing of the arms of La Bastie, and allowed the shop-people twenty hours to engrave them.The handle, a masterpiece of delicate workmanship, was fitted to an india-rubber whip and put into a morocco case lined with velvet, on which two M.’s interlaced were stamped in gold."
"星期三早晨，拉布里埃乘邮车返回到勒阿弗尔，刚好赶上跟卡那利吃早餐。诗人隐瞒了他秘书不在的事情，说他正忙于巴黎派过来的一些工作。邮车一到，比查就跟拉布里埃见了面，他把这个装着艺术珍品的盒子拿到了弗朗索瓦丝·科歇那里，并指示她将其放到莫黛斯特的梳妆台上。","La Briere got back to Havre by the mail-coach Wednesday morning in time to breakfast with Canalis.The poet had concealed his secretary’s absence by declaring that he was busy with some work sent from Paris.Butscha, who met La Briere at the coach-door, took the box containing the precious work of art to Francoise Cochet, with instructions to place it on Modeste’s dressing-table."
"“你们今天一定会陪莫黛斯特小姐去骑马吧？”比查问道。他到了卡那利家里，向拉布里埃使了个眼色，意思是马鞭已经送达目的地。","“Of course you will accompany Mademoiselle Modeste on her ride today?” said Butscha, who went to Canalis’s house to let La Briere know by a wink that the whip had gone to its destination."
"“我吗？”埃内斯特回答说，“不，我要睡觉。”","“I?” answered Ernest; “no, I am going to bed.”"
"“什么！”卡那利看着他，大叫道，“真不晓得你搞什么鬼。”","“Bah!” exclaimed Canalis, looking at him.“I don’t know what to make of you.”"
"这时早餐做好了，诗人自然地邀请他们的访客留下来吃早餐。比查答应了，他从贴身男仆的表情中已经看出他的计谋成功了。我们将会看到他对莫黛斯特许诺过的最初成果。","Breakfast was then served, and the poet naturally invited their visitor to stay and take it.Butscha complied, having seen in the expression of the valet’s face the success of a trick in which we shall see the first fruits of his promise to Modeste."
"“先生将拉图奈尔先生的文书留下来，是非常正确的。”热尔曼在他主人的耳边低声说道。","“Monsieur is very right to detain the clerk of Monsieur Latournelle,” whispered Germain in his master’s ear."
"卡那利和热尔曼之间交换了个暗号，两人便去了客厅。","Canalis and Germain went into the salon on a sign that passed between them."
"“先生，我今天早晨去看人打渔了，”贴身男仆说——“是一位小帆船船主叫我去的，我跟他是朋友。”","“I went out this morning to see the men fish, monsieur,” said the valet,—“an excursion proposed to me by the captain of a smack, whose acquaintance I have made.”"
"热尔曼没有承认他到一家咖啡馆打台球这一低级趣味——比查利用了这件事，在他周围安排了一些自己的朋友，并随心所欲地操纵他。","Germain did not acknowledge that he had the bad taste to play billiards in a cafe,—a fact of which Butscha had taken advantage to surround him with friends of his own and manage him as he pleased."
"“然后呢？”卡那利说，“说重点，快点儿！”","“Well?” said Canalis, “to the point,—quick!”"
"“男爵先生，我听到有人谈论米尼翁先生的事，便尽量怂恿他们多说点儿，因为当然没有人知道我是您的下人。啊！先生，从码头上的谈话来看，您中圈套了。德拉巴斯蒂小姐的财产就跟她的名字一样，非常微不足道。她父亲开回来的船不是他的，而是中国富商的，他要向那些富商交账的。他们还说了一些有损米尼翁先生名声的事情。我听说您在同公爵先生争夺德拉巴斯蒂小姐，所以冒昧地提醒您，你们两个里头，让那位大老爷得到她，不是更好吗？在回来的路上，我在码头上转了转，进了那个商人们集会的剧院大厅，我壮着胆子在他们中间钻进钻出。那些好心人看到一个衣冠楚楚的陌生人，便开始跟我谈勒阿弗尔的事情，而我就一点点地引导他们说起了米尼翁上校。他们所说的证实了渔民们的话，所以我觉得要是再不吱声的话，就有点失职了。这就是为什么我今天早晨没能及时回来给先生着装。”","“Monsieur le baron, I heard a conversation about Monsieur Mignon, which I encouraged as far as I could; for no one, of course, knew that I belong to you.Ah! monsieur, judging by the talk of the quays, you are running your head into a noose.The fortune of Mademoiselle de La Bastie is, like her name, modest.The vessel on which the father returned does not belong to him, but to rich China merchants to whom he renders an account.They even say things that are not at all flattering to Monsieur Mignon’s honor.Having heard that you and Monsieur le duc were rivals for Mademoiselle de La Bastie’s hand, I have taken the liberty to warn you; of the two, wouldn’t it be better that his lordship should gobble her?As I came home I walked round the quays, and into that theatre-hall where the merchants meet; I slipped boldly in and out among them.Seeing a well-dressed stranger, those worthy fellows began to talk to me of Havre, and I got them, little by little, to speak of Colonel Mignon.What they said only confirms the stories the fishermen told me; and I feel that I should fail in my duty if I keep silence.That is why I did not get home in time to dress monsieur this morning.”"
"“我该怎么办？”卡那利喊道。他想到前一天晚上跟莫黛斯特表的态，不知道该怎么脱身了。","“What am I to do?” cried Canalis, who remembered his proposals to Modeste the night before, and did not see how he could get out of them."
"“先生知道我对您的衷心，”热尔曼见诗人完全不知所措的样子，便说道，“如果我给您出个主意，您是不会惊讶的吧。那文书就在这儿，设法让他说出实情来。也许，喝了一两瓶、或者至多三瓶香槟之后，他就会说出来的。就像菲罗塞娜多次听公爵夫人说过的，先生有一天是要当大使的，如果您连一个小小的公证人文书都搞不定，那还真是怪了。”","“Monsieur knows my attachment to him,” said Germain, perceiving that the poet was quite thrown off his balance; “he will not be surprised if I give him a word of advice.There is that clerk; try to get the truth out of him.Perhaps he’ll unbutton after a bottle or two of champagne, or at any rate a third.It would be strange indeed if monsieur, who will one day be ambassador, as Philoxene has heard Madame la duchesse say time and time again, couldn’t turn a little notary’s clerk inside out.”"
"第二十三章 比查大显身手","Chapter XXIII Butscha Distinguishes Himself"
"此时，这场试探的幕后策划者比查，正在叮嘱秘书对去巴黎的事守口如瓶，并且不要以任何方式介入他——比查可能要做的事情。米尼翁先生行事低调，并决心绝口不提自己财产的数量，这种做法近来已在勒阿弗尔引起了一些不良反响，而小矮人刚好利用了这一点。那些最为刻薄的人甚至诽谤说，他将一大笔财产转给了迪迈，以此逃避他在中国的合伙人的正当要求。比查就是利用了这种看法。渔民们受过比查许多恩惠，因此比查要求他们为此事保密，并让他们也去散布流言。他们做得非常好。渔船主告诉热尔曼说，他有一个表弟是水手，刚从马赛回来，在那里，米尼翁先生在他开回法国的双桅帆船上付清了这位水手的工钱。帆船是以别人而非米尼翁先生的名义卖掉的，而且船上的货物最多也只值三四十万法郎。","At this instant Butscha, the hidden prompter of the fishing part, was requesting the secretary to say nothing about his trip to Paris, and not to interfere in any way with what he, Butscha, might do.The dwarf had already made use of an unfavorable feeling lately roused against Monsieur Mignon in Havre in consequence of his reserve and his determination to keep silence as to the amount of his fortune.The persons who were most bitter against him even declared calumniously that he had made over a large amount of property to Dumay to save it from the just demands of his associates in China.Butscha took advantage of this state of feeling.He asked the fishermen, who owed him many a good turn, to keep the secret and lend him their tongues.They served him well.The captain of the fishing-smack told Germain that one of his cousins, a sailor, had just returned from Marseilles, where he had been paid off from the brig in which Monsieur Mignon returned to France.The brig had been sold to the account of some other person than Monsieur Mignon, and the cargo was only worth three or four hundred thousand francs at the utmost."
"“热尔曼，”贴身男仆走出客厅时，卡那利说道，“上香槟和红葡萄酒。这位勒阿弗尔律师会成员一定会对我这个诗人的热情好客留下好印象。再说，他有着费加罗一样的才智，”卡那利将手放到小矮人的肩膀上，补充道，“我们要让这才智随着香槟迸发出来，泡沫四溅。埃内斯特，我俩也要陪着喝。说实话，我已经两年多没醉过了。”他看着拉布里埃，补充说。","“Germain,” said Canalis, as the valet was leaving the room, “serve champagne and claret.A member of the legal fraternity of Havre must carry away with him proper ideas of a poet’s hospitality.Besides, he has got a wit that is equal to Figaro’s,” added Canalis, laying his hand on the dwarf’s shoulder, “and we must make it foam and sparkle with champagne; you and I, Ernest, will not spare the bottle either.Faith, it is over two years since I’ve been drunk,” he added, looking at La Briere."
"“您是指没喝酒喝醉过吧，”比查热切地看着他，说，“对，我相信是这样。您每天都自我陶醉，沉醉在那些溢美之词中。哈，您长得一表人才，是位诗人，一生都很出名，天资出众，又颇具演讲才能，而且您还讨所有女人的欢喜——甚至是我主人的夫人。我一生中见过的最美的苏丹王妃（而且我只见过她这么一位）都崇拜您，如果您愿意的话，您可以娶德拉巴斯蒂小姐为妻。天哪！光是细数一下您现在的优势，还不说以后的（贵族头衔、贵族地位、大使馆！），就已经足以让我陶醉了——就像那些喝别人酒的人一样。”","“Not drunk with wine, you mean,” said Butscha, looking keenly at him, “yes, I can believe that.You get drunk every day on yourself, you drink in so much praise.Ha, you are handsome, you are a poet, you are famous in your lifetime, you have the gift of an eloquence that is equal to your genius, and you please all women,—even my master’s wife.Admired by the finest sultana-valide that I ever saw in my life (and I never saw but her) you can, if you choose, marry Mademoiselle de La Bastie.Goodness! the mere inventory of your present advantages, not to speak of the future (a noble title, peerage, embassy!), is enough to make me drunk already,—like the men who bottle other men’s wine.”"
"“所有这些社会上的荣誉，”卡那利说，“如果少了一样赋予它们价值的东西——财富，那它们就没什么用了。咱们现在的谈话是男人之间的谈话，细腻的情感只有在诗中才用得上。”","“All such social distinctions,” said Canalis, “are of little use without the one thing that gives them value,—wealth.Here we can talk as men with men; fine sentiments only do in verse.”"
"“那要看情况了。”小矮人做了一个会意的手势，说道。","“That depends on circumstances,” said the dwarf, with a knowing gesture."
"“啊！起草转让书的先生，”诗人截住话头，微微一笑，说道，“您我都知道‘草屋’和‘草汁’是同韵词——但有谁愿意余生靠此而活呢？”","“Ah! you writer of conveyances,” said the poet, smiling at the interruption, “you know as well as I do that ‘cottage’ rhymes with ‘pottage,’—and who would like to live on that for the rest of his days?”"
"席间，比查扮演了《彩票公司》中特里戈丹的角色，让埃内斯特大为吃惊。埃内斯特从没领略过律师事务所职员的滑稽，那滑稽简直可以跟戏班子的人相媲美。比查滔滔不绝地讲着勒阿弗尔的各种丑闻丑事、发家史和闺房史，还有在诺曼底被人们称为“金蝉脱壳”的知法犯法案。他一个故事都没漏掉，而且，随着酒水像雨水流进排水管一样淌进他的喉咙，他的兴致也越来越高。","At table Butscha played the part of Trigaudin, in the “Maison en loterie,” in a way that alarmed Ernest, who did not know the waggery of a lawyer’s office, which is quite equal to that of an atelier.Butscha poured forth the scandalous gossip of Havre, the private history of fortune and boudoirs, and the crimes committed code in hand, which are called in Normandy, “getting out of a thing as best you can.”He spared no one; and his liveliness increased with the torrents of wine which poured down his throat like rain through a gutter."
"“你知道吗？拉布里埃，”卡那利一面给比查斟酒，一面说，“这小伙子能让一位首席秘书当上大使！”","“Do you know, La Briere,” said Canalis, filling Butscha’s glass, “that this fellow would make a capital secretary to the embassy?”"
"“而且挤掉他的东家！”小矮人向卡那利瞥了一眼，大声说道。卡那利的傲慢都在这碳酸水的咕噜声中湮没了。“我很少会知恩图报，而且很会耍手段，我会骑到您头上去的。哈哈，一位诗人背着一个驼子！那种情形我见到过，经常见到——在书架上。好了，别那样看着我，好像我在表演吞剑似的。我亲爱的伟大天才，您是个上等人，您知道感恩是傻子们才用的词，人们将它收到词典里，但它并不存在于人们心中。只有在某座山上——既不是品都斯山，也不是帕纳赛斯山——誓言才有价值。我的女东家一手把我带大，您认为我欠她很多。上帝保佑，全城的人已经用赞美、尊敬和倾慕偿还她了——那些可是最值钱的东西啊。而我是不会认同任何只能助长自恋的善行的。人们用他们的善行做交易，让借方感激——如此而已。至于阴谋诡计嘛，那可是我的神祗。怎么？”他见卡那利做了一个手势，便惊呼道，“难道您不崇拜那种让一个诡计多端的人战胜天才的能力吗？它能最细致地观察对方的癖好、弱点，并机智地抓住快乐的时刻。您去问问，外交手腕的最大成就是不是诡计战胜武力的结果？如果我是您的秘书，男爵先生，您很快就会当上首相，因为那样对我有利啊。您想不想让我示范一下我在那方面的才能？那好，您听着，您疯狂地爱着莫黛斯特小姐，而且您这样做无可非议。这位少女拥有我最崇高的敬意，她是一个真正的巴黎人。有时候，我们外省也有些真正的巴黎人降生。唔，莫黛斯特正是一个有助于男人事业的女人。她有这个，”他把手腕在空中一转，大声说道，“但您有一个危险的竞争对手，就是公爵。如果我在三天内让他滚出勒阿弗尔，您给我什么报酬？”","“And oust his chief!” cried the dwarf flinging a look at Canalis whose insolence was lost in the gurgling of carbonic acid gas.“I’ve little enough gratitude and quite enough scheming to get astride of your shoulders.Ha, ha, a poet carrying a hunchback! that’s been seen, often seen—on book-shelves.Come, don’t look at me as if I were swallowing swords.My dear great genius, you’re a superior man; you know that gratitude is the word of fools; they stick it in the dictionary, but it isn’t in the human heart; pledges are worth nothing, except on a certain mount that is neither Pindus nor Parnassus.You think I owe a great deal to my master’s wife, who brought me up.Bless you, the whole town has paid her for that in praises, respect, and admiration,—the very best of coin.I don’t recognize any service that is only the capital of self-love.Men make a commerce of their services, and gratitude goes down on the debit side,—that’s all.As to schemes, they are my divinity.What?” he exclaimed, at a gesture of Canalis, “don’t you admire the faculty which enables a wily man to get the better of a man of genius? it takes the closest observation of his vices, and his weaknesses, and the wit to seize the happy moment.Ask diplomacy if its greatest triumphs are not those of craft over force?If I were your secretary, Monsieur le baron, you’d soon be prime-minister, because it would be my interest to have you so.Do you want a specimen of my talents in that line?Well then, listen; you love Mademoiselle Modeste distractedly, and you’ve good reason to do so.The girl has my fullest esteem; she is a true Parisian.Sometimes we get a few real Parisians born down here in the provinces.Well, Modeste is just the woman to help a man’s career.She’s got that in her,” he cried, with a turn of his wrist in the air.“But you’ve a dangerous competitor in the duke; what will you give me to get him out of Havre within three days?”"
"“来喝完这瓶。”诗人边给比查倒酒边说。","“Finish this bottle,” said the poet, refilling Butscha’s glass."
"“您会把我灌醉的。”小矮人举起第九杯酒，一饮而尽，对诗人说道，“您有床让我睡上一觉吗？我的东家简直像只骆驼，滴酒不沾，拉图奈尔夫人也一样。他们两个人都会毫不留情地责骂我，而且他们骂得对——我还要起草契约呢！”然后，他摆出一副喝醉的样子，突然又回到了先前的话题，大声嚷嚷道，“瞧我这记性，真跟我的感恩之心一样。”","“You’ll make me drunk,” said the dwarf, tossing off his ninth glass of champagne.“Have you a bed where I could sleep it off?My master is as sober as the camel that he is, and Madame Latournelle too.They are brutal enough, both of them, to scold me; and they’d have the rights of it too—there are those deeds I ought to be drawing!—” Then, suddenly returning to his previous ideas, after the fashion of a drunken man, he exclaimed, “and I’ve such a memory; it is on a par with my gratitude.”"
"“比查！”诗人大声说，“你刚才说你谁都不感激，你可是自相矛盾了。”","“Butscha!” cried the poet, “you said just now you had no gratitude; you contradict yourself.”"
"“一点儿都不矛盾，”他回答说，“忘记一件事，就意味着几乎总是想起那件事。好了，好了，您想不想我把公爵给解决了？我天生就是个秘书。”","“Not at all,” he replied.“To forget a thing means almost always recollecting it.Come, come, do you want me to get rid of the duke?I’m cut out for a secretary.”"
"“你怎么能办到？”卡那利问道，很高兴谈话自动转移到这个话题上来。","“How could you manage it?” said Canalis, delighted to find the conversation taking this turn of its own accord."
"“这您就不用管了。”小矮人故意打了个嗝，说道。","“That’s none of your business,” said the dwarf, with a portentous hiccough."
"比查的头左摇右晃，眼睛从热尔曼转到拉布里埃，又从拉布里埃转到卡那利，那样子就像那些知道有点自己醉了、又想知道别人是怎么看自己的人似的。在醉酒的海难中，很明显，自尊总是最后沉没的。","Butscha’s head rolled between his shoulders, and his eyes turned from Germain to La Briere, and from La Briere to Canalis, after the manner of men who, knowing they are tipsy, wish to see what other men are thinking of them; for in the shipwreck of drunkenness it is noticeable that self-love is the last thing that goes to the bottom."
"“哈！我伟大的诗人，您自己就是个大阴谋家，可您的道行还不够深。您把我当作您的一位读者，是什么意思？——您派您的朋友快马加鞭到巴黎，就是去打听米尼翁家族的财产吧。哈，哈！我耍把戏，您也耍把戏，我们都耍把戏——好！但请您给我点面子，相信我道行够高，能保守住我业务的秘密。作为公证人的首席文书，我的心就是个上了锁的盒子，严禁入内！我从未张口泄露过主顾的任何情况。我什么都知道，也什么都不知道。另外，我的热情也是众所周知的。我喜爱莫黛斯特，她是我的学生，而且她应该结门好亲事。如果有必要的话，我会愚弄一下公爵，而您就可以娶——”","“Ha! my great poet, you’re a pretty good trickster yourself; but you are not deep enough.What do you mean by taking me for one of your own readers,—you who sent your friend to Paris, full gallop, to inquire into the property of the Mignon family?Ha, ha! I hoax, thou hoaxest, we hoax—Good!But do me the honor to believe that I’m deep enough to keep the secrets of my own business.As the head-clerk of a notary, my heart is a locked box, padlocked!My mouth never opens to let out anything about a client.I know all, and I know nothing.Besides, my passion is well known.I love Modeste; she is my pupil, and she must make a good marriage.I’ll fool the duke, if need be; and you shall marry—”"
"“热尔曼，上咖啡和利口酒。”卡那利说。","“Germain, coffee and liqueurs,” said Canalis."
"“利口酒！”比查像个冒牌处女拒绝引诱那样一挥手，重复道，“啊，那些可怜的契约！其中有一份婚约，我那个文书副手真是蠢得跟——跟一首祝婚诗一样，还真能在新娘的私人财产问题上捅一刀。他身高五尺六寸，就以为自己是个美男子了——真是个白痴！”","“Liqueurs!” repeated Butscha with a wave of his hand, and the air of a sham virgin repelling seduction; “Ah, those poor deeds! one of ’em was a marriage contract; and that second clerk of mine is as stupid as—as—an epithalamium, and he’s capable of digging his penknife right through the bride’s paraphernalia; he thinks he’s a handsome man because he’s five feet six,—idiot!”"
"“这是一种甜酒，是西印度群岛的一种利口酒。”卡那利说，“莫黛斯特小姐请教你——”","“Here is some creme de the, a liqueur of the West Indies,” said Canalis.“You, whom Mademoiselle Modeste consults—”"
"“对，她请教我。”","“Yes, she consults me.”"
"“那，你觉得她爱我吗？”诗人问道。","“Well, do you think she loves me?” asked the poet."
"“爱您？对，比爱公爵多。”小矮人假装从迷迷糊糊中清醒过来，回答道，那样子装得真是太好了，“她爱您，因为您不在乎财产。她告诉我说，她已经准备好了为您作出最大的牺牲。她会放弃穿着打扮，在自己身上尽量少花钱，并用她的一生来证明，娶了她，就是您为自己做过的最（打嗝）好的事情。她非常健康——对，而且还受过良好教育。她什么都懂，那个姑娘。”","“Loves you? yes, more than she loves the duke,” answered the dwarf, rousing himself from a stupor which was admirably played.“She loves you for your disinterestedness.She told me she was ready to make the greatest sacrifices for your sake; to give up dress and spend as little as possible on herself, and devote her life to showing you that in marrying her you hadn’t done so” (hiccough) “bad a thing for yourself.She’s as right as a trivet,—yes, and well informed.She knows everything, that girl.”"
"“她还有三十万法郎的财产？”","“And she has three hundred thousand francs?”"
"“可能有您说的那么多。”小矮人兴致勃勃地大声说道，“米尼翁老爹——他的天性就像他的名字一样亲切可爱，这就是我为什么尊敬他——他为了嫁女儿，情愿放弃一切。你们这个复辟时代（打嗝），教会了他怎样靠半薪生活。只要他拼命攒钱，攒到了足够的钱，就会把三十万法郎都给小莫黛斯特。就算他跟迪迈过着几乎身无分文的日子，也会很满足的。但是，别忘了迪迈还要把自己所有的财产留给莫黛斯特呢。您知道，迪迈是个布列塔尼人，这点很关键，他不会食言的，他的财产赶得上中校。但我不赞同米尼翁先生赎回公馆，我也是这样跟他们说的，因为他们经常问我的意见。‘你们在房子上花的钱太多了，’我说，‘如果维尔坎不把它买回去，那二十万法郎就一点儿都不能生利了，剩下的就只有十万法郎，那是不够的。’现在中校和迪迈正在商量这件事。但不管怎样，跟您说实话，莫黛斯特肯定会很有钱。我听说码头上的人对此有所非议，但那都是无稽之谈，他们那是嫉妒。哎呀，在勒阿弗尔哪里有这么多的嫁妆，”比查大声说，一面开始掰手指，数道，“二三十万的现钱，”他用右手的食指将左手的大拇指往下一按，“这是其一；米尼翁别墅的继承权，这是其二；其三，迪迈的财产！”说着两次掰下他的中指，“哈！这两个老兵一旦归天，小莫黛斯特马上就可以拥有六十万法郎了。”","“There may be quite as much as that,” cried the dwarf, enthusiastically.“Papa Mignon,—mignon by name, mignon by nature, and that’s why I respect him,—well, he would rob himself of everything to marry his daughter.Your Restoration” (hiccough) “has taught him how to live on half-pay; he’d be quite content to live with Dumay on next to nothing, if he could rake and scrape enough together to give the little one three hundred thousand francs.But don’t let’s forget that Dumay is going to leave all his money to Modeste.Dumay, you know, is a Breton, and that fact clinches the matter; he won’t go back from his word, and his fortune is equal to the colonel’s.But I don’t approve of Monsieur Mignon’s taking back that villa, and, as they often ask my advice, I told them so.‘You sink too much in it,’ I said; ‘if Vilquin does not buy it back there’s two hundred thousand francs which won’t bring you a penny; it only leaves you a hundred thousand to get along with, and it isn’t enough.’The colonel and Dumay are consulting about it now.But nevertheless, between you and me, Modeste is sure to be rich.I hear talk on the quays against it; but that’s all nonsense; people are jealous.Why, there’s no such ‘dot’ in Havre,” cried Butscha, beginning to count on his fingers.“Two to three hundred thousand in ready money,” bending back the thumb of his left hand with the forefinger of his right, “that’s one item; the reversion of the villa Mignon, that’s another; ‘tertio,’ Dumay’s property!” doubling down his middle finger.“Ha! little Modeste may count upon her six hundred thousand francs as soon as the two old soldiers have got their marching orders for eternity.”"
"这番粗俗直白的陈述，混杂着各种各样的烈酒，让比查看上去陶醉其中，却让卡那利清醒了过来。对于比查这样一个年轻的乡下人来说，这自然是一笔巨额财产。他用右手掌托着头，大模大样地把胳膊肘支在桌子上，眨巴眨巴眼睛，继续自言自语道：","This coarse and candid statement, intermingled with a variety of liqueurs, sobered Canalis as much as it appeared to befuddle Butscha.To the latter, a young provincial, such a fortune must of course seem colossal.He let his head fall into the palm of his right hand, and putting his elbows majestically on the table, blinked his eyes and continued talking to himself:—"
"“民法在所谓的‘继承权’下，将财产都给夺去了，不出二十年，一位身价百万的女嗣就会跟放债人的慷慨一样罕见了。要是莫黛斯特想花光她财产的所有利息呢——唉，她是如此漂亮，如此甜美可爱，哎呀，她就像——你们诗人总是要用比喻——她就像一只跟猴子一样机灵的鼬鼠。”","“In twenty years, thanks to that Code, which pillages fortunes under what they call ‘Successions,’ an heiress worth a million will be as rare as generosity in a money-lender.Suppose Modeste does want to spend all the interest of her own money,—well, she is so pretty, so sweet and pretty; why she’s—you poets are always after metaphors—she’s a weasel as tricky as a monkey.”"
"“你为什么要跟我说她有六百万呢？”卡那利低声问拉布里埃。","“How came you to tell me she had six millions?” said Canalis to La Briere, in a low voice."
"“我的朋友啊，”埃内斯特说，“我肯定地对你说过，我受誓言约束，要守口如瓶。也许就连现在，我也不能说什么。”","“My friend,” said Ernest, “I do assure you that I was bound to silence by an oath; perhaps, even now, I ought not to say as much as that.”"
"“约束！受谁约束？”","“Bound! to whom?”"
"“受米尼翁先生。”","“To Monsieur Mignon.”"
"“埃内斯特！你知道财产对我有多重要——”","“Ernest! you who know how essential fortune is to me—”"
"比查打起鼾来了。","Butscha snored."
"“你知道我的处境，你也知道如果我胆敢结婚，就会失去德肖利厄公爵夫人的照顾，你，会无情地让我陷入这样的圈套吗？”卡那利惊呼道，脸色变得苍白，“这是个关系到友情的问题，而我们的友情，可是早在你见到那个狡猾的米尼翁之前就立下了契约的啊。”","“—who know my situation, and all that I shall lose in the Duchesse de Chaulieu, by this attempt at marrying, YOU could coldly let me plunge into such a thing as this?” exclaimed Canalis, turning pale.“It was a question of friendship; and ours was a compact entered into long before you ever saw that crafty Mignon.”"
"“我亲爱的朋友，”埃内斯特说，“我太爱莫黛斯特了，不能——”","“My dear fellow,” said Ernest, “I love Modeste too well to—”"
"“傻子！那我把她让给你好了，”诗人叫道，“别管那誓言了。”","“Fool! then take her,” cried the poet, “and break your oath.”"
"“你能否以荣誉向我担保，无论发生什么事情，你都要忘记我现在告诉你的一切，在我面前也要表现得我从来都没跟你说过这秘密一样？”","“Will you promise me on your word of honor to forget what I now tell you, and to behave to me as though this confidence had never been made, whatever happens?”"
"“我以我母亲身后的名誉发誓。”","“I’ll swear that, by my mother’s memory.”"
"“那好，”拉布里埃说，“在巴黎，米尼翁先生跟我说，他的财产远没有蒙日诺商行告诉我的、也就是我告诉你的那么多。中校准备给他女儿二十万法郎。现在，梅尔基奥尔，我问你，这位父亲真的如你所想的那样，不信任我们吗？还是他是真心诚意的？这些问题不用我去作答了。就算莫黛斯特身无分文，只要她肯屈尊选择我，我也会娶她。”","“Well then,” said La Briere, “Monsieur Mignon told me in Paris that he was very far from having the colossal fortune which the Mongenods told me about and which I mentioned to you.The colonel intends to give two hundred thousand francs to his daughter.And now, Melchior, I ask you, was the father really distrustful of us, as you thought; or was he sincere?It is not for me to answer those questions.If Modeste without a fortune deigns to choose me, she will be my wife.”"
"“一位才女！受的教育吓死人！什么书都读过，什么事都知道——理论上讲，”卡那利看到拉布里埃的手势，便马上大声说道，“她是一个娇生惯养的孩子，从小在奢华中长大，中间间断了五年。","“A blue-stocking! educated till she is a terror! a girl who has read everything, who knows everything,—in theory,” cried Canalis, hastily, noticing La Briere’s gesture, “a spoiled child, brought up in luxury in her childhood, and weaned of it for five years."
"啊！我可怜的朋友，仔细想想你要做的吧。”","Ah! my poor friend, take care what you are about.”"
"“颂歌和法典，”比查醒了过来，说道，“您搞颂歌，我搞法典，你我之间只有一个Ｃ的区别。好，‘code'这个词是由‘coda'演变而来的，是尾巴的意思——请记住这个词！你们看看！一个好建议，抵得上你们的葡萄酒和利口酒。米尼翁老爹——他也是利口酒，是最正直的人——他正要跟他的女儿去骑马，您可以直接去跟他谈嫁妆的事。他会很直白地告诉您，您会知道真相的，就跟我是真醉了一样，您是位伟大的诗人——但不管这件事如何，我们要一起离开勒阿弗尔，说定了，对吗？我要当您的秘书，代替那个坐在那儿朝着我咧嘴笑、以为我喝醉了的小子。来吧，我们走，让他去娶那个姑娘吧。”","“Ode and Code,” said Butscha, waking up, “you do the ode and I the code; there’s only a C’s difference between us.Well, now, code comes from ‘coda,’ a tail,—mark that word!See here! a bit of good advice is worth your wine and your cream of tea.Father Mignon—he’s cream, too; the cream of honest men—he is going with his daughter on this riding party; do you go up frankly and talk ‘dot’ to him.He’ll answer plainly, and you’ll get at the truth, just as surely as I’m drunk, and you’re a great poet,—but no matter for that; we are to leave Havre together, that’s settled, isn’t it?I’m to be your secretary in place of that little fellow who sits there grinning at me and thinking I’m drunk.Come, let’s go, and leave him to marry the girl.”"
"卡那利起身离开客厅，去换外出的衣服。","Canalis rose to leave the room to dress for the excursion."
"“嘘，什么都别说——他是去自寻死路。”比查清醒得像个法官一样，对拉布里埃低声说道，一面又朝卡那利的背面做了一个市井顽童的动作，“再见了，我的东道主！”他亮开嗓子喊道，“您能允许我去花园的凉亭里小睡一会儿吗？”","“Hush, not a word,—he is going to commit suicide,” whispered Butscha, sober as a judge, to La Briere as he made the gesture of a street boy at Canalis’s back.“Adieu, my chief!” he shouted, in stentorian tones, “will you allow me to take a snooze in that kiosk down in the garden?”"
"“请自便吧。”诗人回答说。","“Make yourself at home,” answered the poet."
"比查在宅子三个仆人的笑声中，穿过花坛，绕过花盆，走到凉亭。那可笑的姿态，就像一只飞虫试图飞出一扇关着的窗户，不停地打转转。等他爬到凉亭里，仆人也都退下后，他便坐到一条木凳子上，沉浸在胜利的喜悦之中。他完全愚弄了一位伟大的人物，不仅撕下了他的面纱，还让他自己解开了绳索。他像一位剧作家一样，看着自己的作品大笑——也就是说，他真正感觉到了他的“vis comica”的巨大价值。","Butscha, pursued by the laughter of the three servants of the establishment, gained the kiosk by walking over the flower-beds and round the vases with the perverse grace of an insect describing its interminable zig-zags as it tries to get out of a closed window.When he had clambered into the kiosk, and the servants had retired, he sat down on a wooden bench and wallowed in the delights of his triumph.He had completely fooled a great man; he had not only torn off his mask, but he had made him untie the strings himself; and he laughed like an author over his own play,—that is to say, with a true sense of the immense value of his “vis comica.”"
"“人人都是陀螺！”他高声叫道，“你只要找到抽动它的那根绳子就好了。不过我也跟别人一样，”他马上补充道，“如果有人过来跟我说‘莫黛斯特小姐刚刚掉下马来，摔断了腿’，那我会晕过去的。”","“Men are tops!” he cried, “you’ve only to find the twine to wind ’em up with.But I’m like my fellows,” he added, presently.“I should faint away if any one came and said to me ‘Mademoiselle Modeste has been thrown from her horse, and has broken her leg.’”"
"第二十四章 诗人过分自恋","Chapter XXIV The Poet Feels That He Is Loved Too Well"
"一小时后，莫黛斯特身着迷人的深绿色开司米细毛呢骑装，头顶小帽，戴着绿色面纱和鹿皮手套，脚登一双与她衬裤的蕾丝边齐高的丝绒靴子，骑在一匹披挂着华丽装饰的小马上，正在向他父亲和德埃鲁维尔公爵展示她刚刚收到的漂亮礼物。很明显，她对这种尤其讨女人欢心的细心感到很高兴。","An hour later, Modeste, charmingly equipped in a bottle-green cassimere habit, a small hat with a green veil, buckskin gloves, and velvet boots which met the lace frills of her drawers, and mounted on an elegantly caparisoned little horse, was exhibiting to her father and the Duc d’Herouville the beautiful present she had just received; she was evidently delighted with an attention of a kind that particularly flatters women."
"“这是您送给我的吗，公爵先生？”她将那金光闪闪的握柄伸到他面前，说道，“它附着一张卡片，写着‘猜猜看’，然后是一些星号。弗朗索瓦丝和迪迈认为是比查给了我这个了不起的惊喜，但我亲爱的比查买不起这种红宝石。至于爸爸嘛（我记得星期天晚上我对他说过我没马鞭），他派人去鲁昂买了这个。”——莫黛斯特指着她父亲手里的一条马鞭说道。那条马鞭的握柄像一个绿松石圆锥体，当时很流行，后来就变得很普通了。","“Did it come from you, Monsieur le duc?” she said, holding the sparkling handle toward him.“There was a card with it, saying, ‘Guess if you can,’ and some asterisks.Francoise and Dumay credit Butscha with this charming surprise; but my dear Butscha is not rich enough to buy such rubies.And as for papa (to whom I said, as I remember, on Sunday evening, that I had no whip), he sent to Rouen for this one,”—pointing to a whip in her father’s hand, with a top like a cone of turquoise, a fashion then in vogue which has since become vulgar."
"“小姐，为了拥有向您赠送那么漂亮的宝石的权利，我就是减寿十年也愿意啊。”公爵谦恭有礼地说道。","“I would give ten years of my old age, mademoiselle, to have the right to offer you that beautiful jewel,” said the duke, courteously."
"“啊，是这个胆大包天的家伙送的！”卡那利骑马过来时，莫黛斯特大叫道，“只有诗人才知道去哪儿找这样精美的东西。先生，”她对梅尔基奥尔说，“我父亲会责备您的，他会说，您算是让那些指责您挥金如土的人说准了。”","“Ah, here comes the audacious giver!” cried Modeste, as Canalis rode up.“It is only a poet who knows where to find such choice things.Monsieur,” she said to Melchior, “my father will scold you, and say that you justify those who accuse you of extravagance.”"
"“噢！”卡那利故作天真地惊呼道，“这就是为什么拉布里埃要快马加鞭地从勒阿弗尔跑到巴黎去？”","“Oh!” exclaimed Canalis, with apparent simplicity, “so that is why La Briere rode at full gallop from Havre to Paris?”"
"“您的秘书会如此放肆？”莫黛斯特说道，脸色马上变得苍白，并不屑地将马鞭猛地扔给了弗朗索瓦丝，“爸爸，把您的马鞭给我。”","“Does your secretary take such liberties?” said Modeste, turning pale, and throwing the whip to Francoise with an impetuosity that expressed scorn.“Give me your whip, papa.”"
"“可怜的埃内斯特，正累得半死地躺在床上呢！”卡那利赶上已经快马奔驰的少女，说道，“小姐，您真无情。那可怜的小伙子跟我说，‘我只有这么一次机会让她记住我。’”","“Poor Ernest, who lies there on his bed half-dead with fatigue!” said Canalis, overtaking the girl, who had already started at a gallop.“You are pitiless, mademoiselle.‘I have’ (the poor fellow said to me) ‘only this one chance to remain in her memory.’”"
"“那么，您会看得起一个能从半个教区收到礼物的女人吗？”莫黛斯特说。","“And should you think well of a woman who could take presents from half the parish?” said Modeste."
"诗人没回答这个问题，莫黛斯特为此感到很奇怪，她把诗人的漫不经心归因于马蹄声的嘈杂。","She was surprised to receive no answer to this inquiry, and attributed the poet’s inattention to the noise of the horse’s feet."
"“您真喜欢折磨那些爱您的人，”公爵说，“您高贵的心灵，还有您的自尊，跟您的缺点如此不协调，我都开始怀疑您是在毁谤自己，故意做那些任性的事。”","“How you delight in tormenting those who love you,” said the duke.“Your nobility of soul and your pride are so inconsistent with your faults that I begin to suspect you calumniate yourself, and do those naughty things on purpose.”"
"“啊！您现在才发现吗，公爵先生？”她笑着大声说道，“您真有当丈夫的精明啊。”","“Ah! have you only just found that out, Monsieur le duc?” she exclaimed, laughing.“You have the sagacity of a husband.”"
"几个人沉默不语地骑了半英里路。令莫黛斯特万分诧异的是，她竟没能从诗人的眼中看到那爱的火花。前一天晚上，当她把落日余晖照在水面上的动人景象指给他看时，注意到他心不在焉，便说道：“怎么，难道您没看见吗？”——他的回答是：“我只看见了您的手。”可现在，他对自然之美的热爱看上去有点太过强烈了，有些不自然。","They rode half a mile in silence.Modeste was a good deal astonished not to receive the fire of the poet’s eyes.The evening before, as she was pointing out to him an admirable effect of setting sunlight across the water, she had said, remarking his inattention, “Well, don’t you see it?”—to which he replied, “I can see only your hand”; but now his admiration for the beauties of nature seemed a little too intense to be natural."
"“德拉布里埃先生会骑马吗？”她为了和他逗乐，便问道。","“Does Monsieur de La Briere know how to ride?” she asked, for the purpose of teasing him."
"“不太会，但还凑合。”诗人像哥本海姆对于中校的归来那样冷冷地回答道。","“Not very well, but he gets along,” answered the poet, cold as Gobenheim before the colonel’s return."
"在一个交叉路口，米尼翁先生让他们穿过一座美丽的山谷，到高地上去俯瞰塞纳河。这时，卡那利让莫黛斯特和公爵走在前面，然后放慢了速度，跟中校并肩而行。","At a cross-road, which Monsieur Mignon made them take through a lovely valley to reach a height overlooking the Seine, Canalis let Modeste and the duke pass him, and then reined up to join the colonel."
"“伯爵先生，”他说，“您是一位坦率的军人，我想您会把我的直率当作对您尊敬的表现。当求婚，以及与此有关的所有粗野的——或者如果您愿意的话，也可以说是过于礼貌的——讨论，通过第三者说出，会伤害到所有人。我们都是绅士，也都很谨慎，而且您和我一样，已经过了大惊小怪的年纪。因此，就让咱们像密友一样交谈吧。我先开个头儿。我现年二十九，没有地产，却雄心勃勃。您也一定看出来了，我非常喜欢莫黛斯特小姐。现在，虽然您的爱女随意给自己安上了那些小缺点——”","“Monsieur le comte,” he said, “you are an open-hearted soldier, and I know you will regard my frankness as a title to your esteem.When proposals of marriage, with all their brutal,—or, if you please, too civilized—discussions, are carried on by third parties, it is an injury to all.We are both gentlemen, and both discreet; and you, like myself, have passed beyond the age of surprises.Let us therefore speak as intimates.I will set you the example.I am twenty-nine years old, without landed estates, and full of ambition.Mademoiselle Modeste, as you must have perceived, pleases me extremely.Now, in spite of the little defects which your dear girl likes to assume—”"
"“——还没算上她那些真正的缺点呢。”中校笑着说——","“—not counting those she really possesses,” said the colonel, smiling,—"
"“——我还是很乐意娶她为妻，而且我相信，我能带给她幸福。我至今前程未卜，财产问题对我的前程来说是至关重要的。所有的少女都希望能够被爱——不管有没有财产。但您不会一点儿嫁妆都不给就把您心爱的莫黛斯特嫁出去，您不是那种人。而我的处境也不允许我为所谓的爱情而结婚，对方起码要是一位财产跟我相当的女子。我的薪水、各种闲职的津贴、学院的补贴，再加上作品的收入，我每年大约能挣三万法郎，这对一个单身汉来说，已是一笔较大的收入了。如果我的妻子跟我的收入差不多，那我就能大致维持现在的状况。您会给小姐一百万吗？”","“—I should gladly make her my wife, and I believe I could render her happy.The question of money is of the utmost importance to my future, which hangs today in the balance.All young girls expect to be loved whether or no—fortune or no fortune.But you are not the man to marry your dear Modeste without a ‘dot,’ and my situation does not allow me to make a marriage of what is called love unless with a woman who has a fortune at least equal to mine.I have, from my emoluments and sinecures, from the Academy and from my works, about thirty thousand francs a year, a large income for a bachelor.If my wife brought me as much more, I should still be in about the same condition that I am now.Shall you give Mademoiselle a million?”"
"“啊，先生，我们还没到讨论这个的时候呢。”中校狡猾地说道。","“Ah, monsieur, we have not reached that point as yet,” said the colonel, Jesuitically."
"“那么，”卡那利赶快说，“如果我们不说这个呢，先把这个问题放一边。伯爵先生，您没理由埋怨我。全世界都会认为我是您那迷人的女儿的不幸追求者之一。请以您的名誉向我保证，您不会跟任何人说起这件事，哪怕是莫黛斯特小姐也不行，因为，”他作为安慰筹码，补充说，“我的处境也可能发生变化，那样我会不要嫁妆就请您把她嫁给我的。”","“Then suppose,” said Canalis, quickly, “that we go no further; we will let the matter drop.You shall have no cause to complain of me, Monsieur le comte; the world shall consider me among the unfortunate suitors of your charming daughter.Give me your word of honor to say nothing on the subject to any one, not even to Mademoiselle Modeste, because,” he added, throwing a word of promise to the ear, “my circumstances may so change that I can ask you for her without ‘dot.’”"
"“我答应您。”中校说，“先生，您知道在巴黎和外省，众人是怎样谈论发财的人和破落的人。人们把幸运和倒霉都夸张了；我们从来都没像人们所说的那样幸运，也从来没像人们所说的那样不幸。做生意，只有把钱转成了地产，才算是稳妥了。我正万分焦急地等着我的代理人发来报告呢。我的货物和船只销售，以及在中国的账务结算事宜，都还没办完，我至少要过六个月才能知道我的全部财产有多少。不过，我的确在巴黎跟德拉布里埃先生说过，我保证会有二十万法郎的现钱给女儿作嫁妆。我想限嗣继承我的财产，并让我的外孙继承我的家徽和头衔。”","“I promise you that,” said the colonel.“You know, monsieur, with what assurance the public, both in Paris and the provinces, talk of fortunes that they make and unmake.People exaggerate both happiness and unhappiness; we are never so fortunate nor so unfortunate as people say we are.There is nothing sure and certain in business except investments in land.I am awaiting the accounts of my agents with very great impatience.The sale of my merchandise and my ship, and the settlement of my affairs in China, are not yet concluded; and I cannot know the full amount of my fortune for at least six months.I did, however, say to Monsieur de La Briere in Paris that I would guarantee a ‘dot’ of two hundred thousand francs in ready money.I wish to entail my estates, and enable my grandchildren to inherit my arms and title.”"
"卡那利听完第一句，就没再把这番话听下去。四个骑手来到了一条较宽的路上，便并排前行，很快就到了一块高地上，从那里他们可以将通往鲁昂的富饶的塞纳河山谷尽收眼底，从另一边又可以饱览海天一色的美景。","Canalis did not listen to this statement after the opening sentence.The four riders, having now reached a wider road, went abreast and soon reached a stretch of table-land, from which the eye took in on one side the rich valley of the Seine toward Rouen, and on the other an horizon bounded only by the sea."
"“比查说对了，上帝是最伟大的风景画家。”卡那利凝望着眼前的美景，说道。在众多让塞纳河畔盛名远播的美景当中，这里算是独一无二的了。","“Butscha was right, God is the greatest of all landscape painters,” said Canalis, contemplating the view, which is unique among the many fine scenes that have made the shores of the Seine so justly celebrated."
"“尤其是在打猎的日子里，我亲爱的男爵，”公爵说，“这时大自然苏醒了，欢快的喧闹声会打破这静谧，这时，我们快马从美景中间穿过，它瞬息万变，看上去真是令人赞叹。”","“Above all do we feel that, my dear baron,” said the duke, “on hunting-days, when nature has a voice, and a lively tumult breaks the silence; at such times the landscape, changing rapidly as we ride through it, seems really sublime.”"
"“太阳就是取之不尽用之不竭的调色板。”莫黛斯特以一种疑惑的眼神看着诗人，说道。","“The sun is the inexhaustible palette,” said Modeste, looking at the poet in a species of bewilderment."
"过了一会儿，她说诗人心不在焉，他便借此说刚刚是沉浸在自己的思绪之中了——比起其他人，作家们更有理由使用这个借口。","A remark that she presently made on his absence of mind gave him an opportunity of saying that he was just then absorbed in his own thoughts,—an excuse that authors have more reason for giving than other men."
"“我们过着上流社会的日子，用各种虚幻的欲望和过分的虚荣来填满我们的生活，这样真的幸福吗？”莫黛斯特说道。她被这富饶的、绵延起伏的乡村景象所吸引，渴望得到一种达观而宁静的生活。","“Are we really made happy by carrying our lives into the midst of the world, and swelling them with all sorts of fictitious wants and over-excited vanities?” said Modeste, moved by the aspect of the fertile and billowy country to long for a philosophically tranquil life."
"“那种田园牧歌，小姐，只能被写在黄金做成的竹简上。”诗人说道。","“That is a bucolic, mademoiselle, which is only written on tablets of gold,” said the poet."
"“有时候也在阁楼里写。”中校评论说。","“And sometimes under garret-roofs,” remarked the colonel."
"莫黛斯特目光锐利地瞥了卡那利一眼，那一眼简直令他难以承受。她感到耳中一阵轰鸣，眼前似乎一片漆黑，然后，她突然用冰冷的语调叫道：","Modeste threw a piercing glance at Canalis, which he was unable to sustain; she was conscious of a ringing in her ears, darkness seemed to spread before her, and then she suddenly exclaimed in icy tones:—"
"“啊！今天星期三了！”","“Ah! it is Wednesday!”"
"“小姐，我这样说并不是要迎合您刚刚的异想天开，”公爵说道，这在莫黛斯特看来如此伤感的景象却给了他思考的时间，“但我要声明，我对上流社会、宫廷，还有巴黎是深恶痛绝的，如果我有幸得到像小姐这样有才智又有风韵的德埃鲁维尔公爵夫人，那我会欢喜地像一位贤哲一样隐居在我的城堡里，对周围人行善，将沼泽地的水抽干，教育子女——”","“I do not say this to flatter your passing caprice, mademoiselle,” said the duke, to whom the little scene, so tragical for Modeste, had left time for thought; “but I declare I am so profoundly disgusted with the world and the Court and Paris that had I a Duchesse d’Herouville, gifted with the wit and graces of mademoiselle, I would gladly bind myself to live like a philosopher at my chateau, doing good around me, draining my marshes, educating my children—”"
"“公爵先生，您伟大的善心会让这一愿望实现的。”莫黛斯特说道，眼神一刻都没有离开这位高贵的绅士，“我很高兴，您不认为我轻浮，而且相信我有足够的内在力量，能够在孤独中生活。也许这就是我的命运。”她以一种遗憾的神情朝卡那利看了一眼，补充道。","“That, Monsieur le duc, will be set to the account of your great goodness,” said Modeste, letting her eyes rest steadily on the noble gentleman.“You flatter me in not thinking me frivolous, and in believing that I have enough resources within myself to be able to live in solitude.It is perhaps my lot,” she added, glancing at Canalis, with an expression of pity."
"“所有财产平平的人，都是这样的命运。”诗人说，“巴黎要求巴比伦般的奢华。有时候，我都问自己是怎么混过来的。”","“It is the lot of all insignificant fortunes,” said the poet.“Paris demands Babylonian splendor.Sometimes I ask myself how I have ever managed to keep it up.”"
"“是国王让咱俩混过来的，”公爵直率地说道，“我们是靠陛下的恩赐而活的。自从人称散-马尔斯的伟人先生去世后，要不是陛下允许我们家为他效命，恐怕我们都要被逼把埃鲁维尔卖给黑帮了。啊，小姐，请相信我，将金钱和婚姻混在一起，对我来说真是一种难以忍受的羞辱。”","“The king does that for both of us,” said the duke, candidly; “we live on his Majesty’s bounty.If my family had not been allowed, after the death of Monsieur le Grand, as they call Cinq-Mars, to keep his office among us, we should have been obliged to sell Herouville to the Black Brethren.Ah, believe me, mademoiselle, it is a bitter humiliation to me to have to think of money in marrying.”"
"这番发自内心的诚恳表白，以及如此真诚的叹惜，让莫黛斯特为之感动。","The simple honesty of this confession came from his heart, and the regret was so sincere that it touched Modeste."
"“公爵先生，”诗人说，“如今在法国，没有一个人能那么有钱，仅凭一个女人本身，凭她的人格价值、风韵，或者美貌，就娶了她——”","“In these days,” said the poet, “no man in France, Monsieur le duc, is rich enough to marry a woman for herself, her personal worth, her grace, or her beauty—”"
"中校先是看了看莫黛斯特，她的脸上已找不到哪怕一丝的惊愕了，然后，又向卡那利投去不解的目光。","The colonel looked at Canalis with a curious eye, after first watching Modeste, whose face no longer expressed the slightest astonishment."
"“对于有着高贵荣誉的人来说，”他慢慢地说道，“用财富来补救时间和命运的摧残，复兴古老的名门望族，是一种对财富的高贵使用。”","“For persons of high honor,” he said slowly, “it is a noble employment of wealth to repair the ravages of time and destiny, and restore the old historic families.”"
"“是的，爸爸。”莫黛斯特严肃地说道。","“Yes, papa,” said Modeste, gravely."
"中校和蔼可亲地邀请公爵和卡那利穿着马服跟他共进晚餐，他答应他们自己也不更衣。莫黛斯特回到房里梳妆打扮时，看了看早晨被她鄙视了一番的那根宝石马鞭。","The colonel invited the duke and Canalis to dine with him sociably in their riding-dress, promising them to make no change himself.When Modeste went to her room to make her toilette, she looked at the jewelled whip she had disdained in the morning."
"“如今做这样的东西，要多么地精雕细琢啊！”她对已经成为她的贴身女仆的弗朗索瓦丝·科歇说道。","“What workmanship they put into such things nowadays!” she said to Francoise Cochet, who had become her waiting-maid."
"“小姐，那个可怜的的年轻人，都发烧了——”","“That poor young man, mademoiselle, who has got a fever—”"
"“谁告诉你的？”","“Who told you that?”"
"“比查先生。他今天下午过来，让我跟您说，他希望您注意到他已经兑现了那天对您许下的诺言。”","“Monsieur Butscha.He came here this afternoon and asked me to say to you that he hoped you would notice he had kept his word on the appointed day.”"
"穿着高贵而朴素的莫黛斯特下楼来到了客厅里。","Modeste came down into the salon dressed with royal simplicity."
"“我亲爱的父亲，”她挽着中校的胳膊，大声说道，“请去慰问一下德拉布里埃先生的健康状况，并把他的礼物带回去。您可以说，我那点微薄的财产和淳朴的品味，不容许我佩戴这些只适合王后或者交际花们的饰品。再说，我只能接受我的新郎的礼物。请求他保管好这条马鞭，直到您知道自己是不是有足够的钱把它买回来。”","“My dear father,” she said aloud, taking the colonel by the arm, “please go and ask after Monsieur de La Briere’s health, and take him back his present.You can say that my small means, as well as my natural tastes, forbid my wearing ornaments which are only fit for queens or courtesans.Besides, I can only accept gifts from a bridegroom.Beg him to keep the whip until you know whether you are rich enough to buy it back.”"
"“我的小姑娘变理智了。”中校轻吻他女儿的额头，说道。","“My little girl has plenty of good sense,” said the colonel, kissing his daughter on the forehead."
"卡那利趁公爵和米尼翁夫人谈话之际，跑到了平台上，莫黛斯特出于好奇，也跟着去了。诗人还以为她是因为想做德卡那利夫人才跟去的呢。他深刻意识到刚刚那种士兵们称之为“向后转”的行为很无礼，可根据野心勃勃之人的法则，每个处于他这种境地的人都会如此无情地变卦的。于是现在，当不幸的莫黛斯特走近他时，他便试图为他的行为找一些貌似可信的理由。","Canalis took advantage of a conversation which began between the duke and Madame Mignon to escape to the terrace, where Modeste joined him, influenced by curiosity, though the poet believed her desire to become Madame de Canalis had brought her there.Rather alarmed at the indecency with which he had just executed what soldiers call a “volte-face,” and which, according to the laws of ambition, every man in his position would have executed quite as brutally, he now endeavored, as the unfortunate Modeste approached him, to find plausible excuses for his conduct."
"“亲爱的莫黛斯特，”他用一种哄骗的语气开了口，“我不知道这样说会不会令您不高兴，站在我们彼此的立场上想一想，您对德埃鲁维尔公爵的答复，对一个爱着您的人来说，是多么让人痛苦——对一个心灵脆弱、敏感，并对真正的情感艳羡不已的诗人尤其如此。您最初的卖弄风情，您预先策划好的种种反复无常，就是为了研究我们的性格，如果我连这都看不出来，我就真是个差劲的外交官了——”","“Dear Modeste,” he began, in a coaxing tone, “considering the terms on which we stand to each other, shall I displease you if I say that your replies to the Duc d’Herouville were very painful to a man in love,—above all, to a poet whose soul is feminine, nervous, full of the jealousies of true passion.I should make a poor diplomatist indeed if I had not perceived that your first coquetries, your little premeditated inconsistencies, were only assumed for the purpose of studying our characters—”"
"莫黛斯特像一只野生动物一样，快速、机灵，而又有些娇媚地抬起头来，这种动物般的本能竟产生了如此神奇的风度。","Modeste raised her head with the rapid, intelligent, half-coquettish motion of a wild animal, in whom instinct produces such miracles of grace."
"“——因此，我回到家，将它们思考一遍之后，就再没被它们所误导了。我只是惊讶，您的聪明跟您的性格和面容是如此和谐一致。您别紧张，我从未怀疑过您假装的表里不一会掩盖那天使般的坦率。不，您的思想，您所受的教育，丝毫都没有减少我们对一个妻子所要求的宝贵的天真无邪。您确实适合做一位诗人、一位外交官、一位思想家、一个注定要历尽生活沉浮之人的妻子，而我对您的钦佩，恰恰和我对您的依恋是同样多。我现在恳求您——如果您昨天接受了一位男子对您的爱，而不是耍他，他的虚荣会变成自豪，他的缺点会在您神圣的影响下变成优点——我恳求您，不要激起他身上那种会发展成恶习的激情。嫉妒在我的心灵里是一种有毒元素，而您已经向我显示出它的力量。它是可怕的，它会毁坏一切——哦！我不是说奥赛罗式的嫉妒。”他注意到了莫黛斯特的手势，便接着说道，“不，不，我的思想是我自己的，我对此一直深信不疑。您知道我对您的爱，以及这份爱带给我的幸福——尽管这幸福只有一点点。”（他伤心地摇了摇头。）“在所有的国度里，人们都把爱情比作孩子，因为它幻想着这个世界是属于自己的，并只能这样幻想。然而，大自然却亲自给这种情感设定了限制。它是个死婴。一个温柔、母性的心灵猜透并抚慰了我内心压抑的痛苦——因为一位感觉到并知道自己已经经历过爱情之欢的女人，在为他人疗伤时，会变得如天使一般。公爵夫人从未让我在感情方面遭受过痛苦。十年来，没有一个字，没有一个眼神，让我受伤！跟一般人相比，我更看重言语、思想和眼神。如果一个眼神对我来说是一笔无价之宝，那么最细微的怀疑都是致命的毒药，它会立即发作，我的爱也就死了。与大部分人相反，我不认为爱情的欢乐在于忐忑、期望和等待——我觉得爱情只能存在于完美的、婴孩般的、无穷的安全之中。女人乐于用她们的风情万种让我们经历一番痛苦的历练，那是一种我不会屈从的卑微的幸福：对我来说，爱情要么是天堂，要么是地狱。如果它是地狱的话，我丝毫都不会接受。对天堂那蔚蓝的天空，我内心感觉到深深的眷恋。在未来的生活里，我能够毫无保留地献身，没有秘密，也没有怀疑或者欺骗，而我要求对方也如此。也许，我的这些疑虑冒犯了您。但是，请记住，我只是在谈论我自己——”","“—and therefore when I returned home and thought them over, they never misled me.I only marvelled at a cleverness so in harmony with your character and your countenance.Do not be uneasy, I never doubted that your assumed duplicity covered an angelic candor.No, your mind, your education, have in no way lessened the precious innocence which we demand in a wife.You are indeed a wife for a poet, a diplomatist, a thinker, a man destined to endure the chances and changes of life; and my admiration is equalled only by the attachment I feel to you.I now entreat you—if yesterday you were not playing a little comedy when you accepted the love of a man whose vanity will change to pride if you accept him, one whose defects will become virtues under your divine influence—I entreat you do not excite a passion which, in him, amounts to vice.Jealousy is a noxious element in my soul, and you have revealed to me its strength; it is awful, it destroys everything—Oh! I do not mean the jealousy of an Othello,” he continued, noticing Modeste’s gesture.“No, no; my thoughts were of myself: I have been so indulged on that point.You know the affection to which I owe all the happiness I have ever enjoyed,—very little at the best” (he sadly shook his head).“Love is symbolized among all nations as a child, because it fancies the world belongs to it, and it cannot conceive otherwise.Well, Nature herself set the limit to that sentiment.It was still-born.A tender, maternal soul guessed and calmed the painful constriction of my heart,—for a woman who feels, who knows, that she is past the joys of love becomes angelic in her treatment of others.The duchess has never made me suffer in my sensibilities.For ten years not a word, not a look, that could wound me!I attach more value to words, to thoughts, to looks, than ordinary men.If a look is to me a treasure beyond all price, the slightest doubt is deadly poison; it acts instantaneously, my love dies.I believe—contrary to the mass of men, who delight in trembling, hoping, expecting—that love can only exist in perfect, infantile, and infinite security.The exquisite purgatory, where women delight to send us by their coquetry, is a base happiness to which I will not submit: to me, love is either heaven or hell.If it is hell, I will have none of it.I feel an affinity with the azure skies of Paradise within my soul.I can give myself without reserve, without secrets, doubts or deceptions, in the life to come; and I demand reciprocity.Perhaps I offend you by these doubts.Remember, however, that I am only talking of myself—”"
"“——冒犯得不轻，但不算太过。”莫黛斯特说道。这番话以德肖利厄公爵夫人为匕首，冒犯了她自尊的每一个角落。“我已经习惯于佩服您了，我亲爱的诗人。”","“—a good deal, but never too much,” said Modeste, offended in every hole and corner of her pride by this discourse, in which the Duchesse de Chaulieu served as a dagger.“I am so accustomed to admire you, my dear poet.”"
"“那好，我给了您狗一样的忠诚，您也能答应给我么？难道这不是很美的事吗？难道这不正是您所渴望的吗？”","“Well, then, can you promise me the same canine fidelity which I offer to you?Is it not beautiful?Is it not just what you have longed for?”"
"“但是，我亲爱的的诗人，您为什么不娶一个又聋又哑，而且还有点傻的女人呢？我别无他求，只希望能让我的丈夫高兴。但您威胁要从一位少女身上夺走您如此善良地为她安排的那种幸福；您是在强拉硬拽地带走每一个手势、每一个词语、每一个眼神；您剪掉鸟儿的翅膀，然后又希望它围着您盘旋。我知道人们指责诗人们反复无常——唉！这非常不公正，”看到卡那利做了一个否认的动作，她便补充道，“这个所谓的缺点，正是由于诗人非凡的头脑考虑到了凡人想不到的东西。然而，我不认为一个天才能编造出这种自相矛盾的境况，还称之为创造生活。您要求这种不可能的事，无非是为了将我置于不义之地而取乐——就像神话故事中的巫师一样，让受迫害的少女干活，直到善良的精灵来解救她。”","“But why, dear poet, do you not marry a deaf-mute, and one who is also something of an idiot?I ask nothing better than to please my husband.But you threaten to take away from a girl the very happiness you so kindly arrange for her; you are tearing away every gesture, every word, every look; you cut the wings of your bird, and then expect it to hover about you.I know poets are accused of inconsistency—oh! very unjustly,” she added, as Canalis made a gesture of denial; “that alleged defect which comes from the brilliant activity of their minds which commonplace people cannot take into account.I do not believe, however, that a man of genius can invent such irreconcilable conditions and call his invention life.You are requiring the impossible solely for the pleasure of putting me in the wrong,—like the enchanters in fairy-tales, who set tasks to persecuted young girls whom the good fairies come and deliver.”"
"“在这种情况下，善良的精灵就是真正的爱情，”卡那利简慢地说道。他意识到了他精心策划的作为决裂的借口，已经被这个由比查一手栽培的敏锐而精明的姑娘看透了。","“In this case the good fairy would be true love,” said Canalis in a curt tone, aware that his elaborate excuse for a rupture was seen through by the keen and delicate mind which Butscha had piloted so well."
"“我亲爱的诗人，您让我想起了那些还不愿意说出自己儿子的娶亲礼金，就去调查一个姑娘的嫁妆的父亲。您还不知道是否有那么一点点权利对我挑剔，您就这样做了。爱情不是通过像您这样干巴巴的讨价还价得来的。相反，可怜的公爵像我的托比大叔一样任我摆布，唯一的不同就是我还不是瓦德曼寡妇——虽然此刻我许多诗意的幻想已经破灭了。啊，是的，我们这样的少女是不会相信任何扰乱我们幻想世界的事物的！之前就有人提醒过我这一切了。我亲爱的诗人，您是在试图激起一场有失您身份的争吵。我再也认不出昨日的梅尔基奥尔了。”","“My dear poet, you remind me of those fathers who inquire into a girl’s ‘dot’ before they are willing to name that of their son.You are quarrelling with me without knowing whether you have the slightest right to do so.Love is not gained by such dry arguments as yours.The poor duke on the contrary abandons himself to it like my Uncle Toby; with this difference, that I am not the Widow Wadman,—though widow indeed of many illusions as to poetry at the present moment.Ah, yes, we young girls will not believe in anything that disturbs our world of fancy!I was warned of all this beforehand.My dear poet, you are attempting to get up a quarrel which is unworthy of you.I no longer recognize the Melchior of yesterday.”"
"“因为梅尔基奥尔已经在您的身上发现了一种野心勃勃的情绪，它——”","“Because Melchior has discovered a spirit of ambition in you which—”"
"莫黛斯特用一种盛气凌人的眼神将他从头到脚打量了一遍。","Modeste looked at him from head to foot with an imperial eye."
"“但我还是会和昨日的梅尔基奥尔一样，当上法兰西的贵族和大使。”卡那利补充道。","“But I shall be peer of France and ambassador as well as he,” added Canalis."
"“您是把我当成了市井女子了，”她边说边开始登上门廊的台阶，但她马上又转过身，补充道，“这种想法就跟把我当成傻子一样无礼。您翻脸不认人，是因为您听了勒阿弗尔人散布的那些可笑的流言，那些话我的女仆弗朗索瓦丝都已经告诉我了。”","“Do you take me for a bourgeois,” she said, beginning to mount the steps of the portico; but she instantly turned back and added,“That is less impertinent than to take me for a fool.The change in your conduct comes from certain silly rumors which you have heard in Havre, and which my maid Francoise has repeated to me.”"
"“啊，莫黛斯特，您怎么能这样想呢？”卡那利摆出一副演戏的姿态，说道，“您认为我只是为了您的财产而娶您的吗？”","“Ah, Modeste, how can you think it?” said Canalis, striking a dramatic attitude.“Do you think me capable of marrying you only for your money?”"
"“您在塞纳河边对我说过那番富有教育意义的话之后，我要是还能错解您的意思，那我也太好骗了。”她说道，用她的蔑视彻底击败了他。","“If I do you that wrong after your edifying remarks on the banks of the Seine can you easily undeceive me,” she said, annihilating him with her scorn."
"“啊！”诗人一边跟着她走进屋里，一边暗自思忖，“我的小姑娘，如果你认为我就要落入那个圈套了，那你就是小看我的老道了。天哪，天哪，这个狡猾的小东西还真是小题大做，我对她的敬重可是跟对婆罗洲国王的一样。但她批评我这种卑劣的情感，也给了我一个决裂的好理由。难道她不狡猾吗？拉布里埃要受罪喽——那个傻瓜！五年之后，看到他们在一起，那可是一个很好的笑话。”","“Ah!” thought the poet, as he followed her into the house, “if you think, my little girl, that I’m to be caught in that net, you take me to be younger than I am.Dear, dear, what a fuss about an artful little thing whose esteem I value about as much as that of the king of Borneo.But she has given me a good reason for the rupture by accusing me of such unworthy sentiments.Isn’t she sly?La Briere will get a burden on his back—idiot that he is!And five years hence it will be a good joke to see them together.”"
"这次争吵让莫黛斯特和卡那利之间冷淡了下来，那天晚上在场的所有人都看出来了。诗人借口说拉布里埃生病了，早早就离开了，把地盘留给了马厩大总管。大约十一点的时候，比查来接拉图奈尔夫人回家，他在莫黛斯特的耳边小声说道，“我说对了吧？”","The coldness which this altercation produced between Modeste and Canalis was visible to all eyes that evening.The poet went off early, on the ground of La Briere’s illness, leaving the field to the grand equerry.About eleven o’clock Butscha, who had come to walk home with Madame Latournelle, whispered in Modeste’s ear, “Was I right?”"
"“唉，说对了。”她说。","“Alas, yes,” she said."
"“但我希望您把门半开着，以便他能回头，您知道我们这样约定过的。”","“But I hope you have left the door half open, so that he can come back; we agreed upon that, you know.”"
"“我已完全被愤怒所左右，”莫黛斯特说，“这种卑鄙的行为让我怒火中烧，而且我已经告诉了他我对他的看法。”","“Anger got the better of me,” said Modeste.“Such meanness sent the blood to my head and I told him what I thought of him.”"
"“哦，那再好不过了。当你们两个都很气愤，不能彼此客气地讲话时，我再让他疯狂地爱上您，而且是十分诚恳的，这样，您自己就会被搞糊涂了。”","“Well, so much the better.When you are both so angry that you can’t speak civilly to each other I engage to make him desperately in love and so pressing that you will be deceived yourself.”"
"“好了，好了，比查，他是一位伟大的诗人，他是一位贵族，他是一个聪明人。”","“Come, come, Butscha; he is a great poet; he is a gentleman; he is a man of intellect.”"
"“您父亲的八百万对他来说，要比那些都重要。”","“Your father’s eight millions are more to him than all that.”"
"“八百万！”莫黛斯特惊呼道。","“Eight millions!” exclaimed Modeste."
"“我的东家卖掉了他的事务所，正要去普罗旺斯处理您父亲的经纪人建议的那桩土地买卖。买下拉巴斯蒂地产的总价是四百万，您的父亲已经同意了。您会有两百万的嫁妆，另外还有一百万用于在巴黎安家，买公馆和置办家具。现在，您算算吧。”","“My master, who has sold his practice, is going to Provence to attend to the purchase of lands which your father’s agent has suggested to him.The sum that is to be paid for the estate of La Bastie is four millions; your father has agreed to it.You are to have a ‘dot’ of two millions and another million for an establishment in Paris, a hotel and furniture.Now, count up.”"
"“啊！那样我就能做德埃鲁维尔公爵夫人了！”莫黛斯特看了比查一眼，叫道。","“Ah! then I can be Duchesse d’Herouville!” cried Modeste, glancing at Butscha."
"“要不是那个小丑卡那利，您就已经收下那个人的马鞭，认为是我送的了。”小矮人说道，间接为拉布里埃辩解。","“If it hadn’t been for that comedian of a Canalis you would have kept HIS whip, thinking it came from me,” said the dwarf, indirectly pleading La Briere’s cause."
"“比查先生，我想问，我嫁人是不是为了让你高兴啊？”莫黛斯特笑着说。","“Monsieur Butscha, may I ask if I am to marry to please you?” said Modeste, laughing."
"“那个优秀的小伙子跟我一样爱您——您也爱过他八天啊，”比查反驳道，“而且他很有良心。”","“That fine fellow loves you as well as I do,—and you loved him for eight days,” retorted Butscha; “and HE has got a heart.”"
"“请问，他能与一位在国王手下任职的人相比吗？国王手下的官职只有六种：国王神甫、首相、御前侍从长、太傅、王室总管、海军总司令——而且他们不再任命王室总管了。”","“Can he compete, pray, with an office under the Crown?There are but six, grand almoner, chancellor, grand chamberlain, grand master, high constable, grand admiral,—but they don’t appoint high constables any longer.”"
"“小姐，再过六个月，由许多狡黠的比查组成的大量民众，就会让所有的那些尊贵头衔灰飞烟灭。再说，如今什么是贵族的标志呢？在法兰西，真正的贵族都不到一千个了。德埃鲁维尔家族是诺曼底罗贝尔时期一个法警的后裔。跟那个愁眉苦脸的老姑姑在一起，您要忍受很多烦恼的。您看——您如此渴望得到公爵夫人的头衔——您已经有伯爵头衔了，而教皇肯定会像看重那些商人一样看重您的，他会赐给您一块名字以‘ia’或者‘agno’结尾的公爵领地。不要为了一个国王手下的官职而丢掉了您的幸福。”","“In six months, mademoiselle, the masses—who are made up of wicked Butschas—could send all those grand dignities to the winds.Besides, what signifies nobility in these days?There are not a thousand real noblemen in France.The d’Herouvilles are descended from a tipstaff in the time of Robert of Normandy.You will have to put up with many a vexation from the old aunt with the furrowed face.Look here,—as you are so anxious for the title of duchess,—you belong to the Comtat, and the Pope will certainly think as much of you as he does of all those merchants down there; he’ll sell you a duchy with some name ending in ‘ia’ or ‘agno.’Don’t play away your happiness for an office under the Crown.”"
"第二十五章 一封老练的来信","CHAPTER XXV A DIPLOMATIC LETTER"
"诗人那天晚上思来想去，考虑的完全是实际问题。他打心眼儿里觉得，没有什么比结了婚而没钱这种境况更糟糕的了。他的虚荣，他想胜过公爵的欲望，以及他相信米尼翁有数百万财产，这一切让他身处险境，想到这里，他还在浑身发抖。更糟糕的是，他已经两个星期没给公爵夫人写信了，而在巴黎，他们一周就要写上四五封信。他开始问自己，公爵夫人会对他呆在勒阿弗尔作何感想。","The poet’s reflections during the night were thoroughly matter of fact.He sincerely saw nothing worse in life than the situation of a married man without money.Still trembling at the danger he had been led into by his vanity, his desire to get the better of the duke, and his belief in the Mignon millions, he began to ask himself what the duchess must be thinking of his stay in Havre, aggravated by the fact that he had not written to her for fourteen days, whereas in Paris they exchanged four or five letters a week."
"“那个可怜的女人还在努力让我被任命为荣誉军团指挥官和巴登宫廷的大使呢！”他叫道。","“And that poor woman is working hard to get me appointed commander of the Legion and ambassador to the Court of Baden!” he cried."
"因此，对未来的一种清楚的直觉，使得诗人像个投机倒把者一样，立即作出了决定，坐下来写了下面这封信：","Thereupon, with that promptitude of decision which results—in poets as well as in speculators—from a lively intuition of the future, he sat down and composed the following letter:—"
"致德肖利厄公爵夫人：","To Madame la Duchesse de Chaulieu:"
"我亲爱的埃莱奥诺尔——没有收到我的来信，你一定颇感意外吧。不过，我呆在这个地方，不完全是由于我的健康的缘故。我一直在帮我们年轻的朋友拉布里埃的忙。这个可怜的小伙子，他爱上了一个叫莫黛斯特·德拉巴斯蒂的小姐，她是一个面色苍白、地位低微、身材单薄的小姑娘。顺便说一下，她有喜爱文学的癖好，还称自己为诗人，以此来为她种种无聊的任性妄为和想入非非申辩。你是知道埃内斯特的——他太容易上钩了，所以我也就不放心丢下他一个人。德拉巴斯蒂小姐想对你的梅尔基奥尔卖弄风情，而且一心要成为你的情敌。但她双臂干瘦，而且跟大部分少女一样，胸部不丰满；还有，她的头发就跟德罗什菲德夫人的一样，暗淡无光泽；她的眼睛很小、阴暗无神，还很多疑。我制止了——可能过于粗暴地——这位不知自重的小姐的卖弄风情。不过，正是爱情，我对你的爱情，要求我那样做。世上所有的女人，跟我有什么关系呢——跟你相比，她们算得上什么呢？","My dear Eleonore,—You have doubtless been surprised at not hearing from me; but the stay I am making in this place is not altogether on account of my health.I have been trying to do a good turn to our little friend La Briere.The poor fellow has fallen in love with a certain Mademoiselle Modeste de La Bastie, a rather pale, insignificant, and thread-papery little thing, who, by the way, has the vice of liking literature, and calls herself a poet to excuse the caprices and humors of a rather sullen nature.You know Ernest,—he is so easy to catch that I have been afraid to leave him to himself.Mademoiselle de La Bastie was inclined to coquet with your Melchior, and was only too ready to become your rival, though her arms are thin, and she has no more bust than most girls; moreover, her hair is as dead and colorless as that of Madame de Rochefide, and her eyes small, gray, and very suspicious.I put a stop—perhaps rather brutally—to the attentions of Mademoiselle Immodeste; but love, such as mine for you, demanded it.What care I for all the women on earth,—compared to you, what are they?"
"和我呆在一起打发时光，也就是围在这位女嗣身边的那些人，都是十足的小市民样，几乎让我作呕。可怜可怜我吧，想想看！我晚上都跟公证人、公证人夫人、账房管家和外省的放债人呆在一起——啊！这跟我在格勒内勒街的夜晚真是天壤之别。她的父亲刚从中国回来，他所谓的财产，把那个不知疲倦的追求者马厩大总管引到勒阿弗尔来了。大总管垂涎她那几百万财产，据说是为了排干他的沼泽地。国王还不知道，他给公爵的那些荒地是个多么要命的礼物。公爵阁下还没有发现这位小姐只有一笔小小的财产，还嫉妒我，而拉布里埃在我这个瞎子般的朋友的掩护下，正悄悄向他的偶像逼近。","The people with whom I pass my time, and who form the circle round the heiress, are so thoroughly bourgeois that they almost turn my stomach.Pity me; imagine!I pass my evenings with notaries, notaresses, cashiers, provincial money-lenders—ah! what a change from my evenings in the rue de Grenelle.The alleged fortune of the father, lately returned from China, has brought to Havre that indefatigable suitor, the grand equerry, hungry after the millions, which he wants, they say, to drain his marshes.The king does not know what a fatal present he made the duke in those waste lands.His Grace, who has not yet found out that the lady had only a small fortune, is jealous of me; for La Briere is quietly making progress with his idol under cover of his friend, who serves as a blind."
"尽管浪漫多情的埃内斯特已为她神魂颠倒，但我这个诗人却主要考虑实质的东西，而且我已经在做一些打探，结果证明我们的朋友前途暗淡。如果我的天使愿意赦免我们一些的小罪过，她就会把银行家蒙日诺请来，用她特有的巧妙手段去盘问他，看莫黛斯特的父亲到底有多少财产。米尼翁先生原来是皇家卫队的骑兵中校，他在过去七年里都是蒙日诺银号的客户。据说，他会给他女儿二十万法郎做嫁妆，但在代表埃内斯特出价之前，我迫切地想了解事情的真相。这件事一办好，我马上就回巴黎去。我知道一个办法，能让事情都有利于我们年轻的情人——只要过继他岳父的头衔即可，而且，我想，由于埃内斯特的竭诚服务，还有你、我，以及公爵给他的帮助，没有谁能比他更顺理成章地得到这一恩赐。凭埃内斯特的兴趣爱好，他自然会在我去巴登之后接替我的职位，领一年两万五千法郎的薪俸。一个终身职衔和一个老婆——这个倒霉的家伙会在巴黎生活得很开心的！","Notwithstanding Ernest’s romantic ecstasies, I myself, a poet, think chiefly of the essential thing, and I have been making some inquiries which darken the prospects of our friend.If my angel would like absolution for some of our little sins, she will try to find out the facts of the case by sending for Mongenod, the banker, and questioning him, with the dexterity that characterizes her, as to the father’s fortune?Monsieur Mignon, formerly colonel of cavalry in the Imperial guard, has been for the last seven years a correspondent of the Mongenods.It is said that he gives his daughter a “dot” of two hundred thousand francs, and before I make the offer on Ernest’s behalf I am anxious to get the rights of the story.As soon as the affair is arranged I shall return to Paris.I know a way to settle everything to the advantage of our young lover,—simply by the transmission of the father-inlaw’s title, and no one, I think, can more readily obtain that favor than Ernest, both on account of his own services and the influence which you and I and the duke can exert for him.With his tastes, Ernest, who of course will step into my office when I go to Baden, will be perfectly happy in Paris with twenty-five thousand francs a year, a permanent place, and a wife—luckless fellow!"
"啊，最最亲爱的，我多么想念格勒内勒大街啊！我离开半个月了！分离没有扼杀我的爱，而是带回了初恋时的全部热情，而且你也许比我更清楚，让我的爱情永不停止的原因是什么——就是进了坟墓，我的骨头还是会爱你的！啊！我无法忍受这种分别。要是我被迫再在这儿呆十天，那我就会回巴黎一次，呆上短短的几个小时。","Ah, dearest, how I long for the rue de Grenelle!Fifteen days of absence! when they do not kill love, they revive all the ardor of its earlier days, and you know, better than I, perhaps, the reasons that make my love eternal,—my bones will love thee in the grave!Ah! I cannot bear this separation.If I am forced to stay here another ten days, I shall make a flying visit of a few hours to Paris."
"公爵为我谋到我们想要的东西了吗？而你，我最最亲爱的人儿，你明年会喝到巴登的山泉水吗？这位“忧郁美男子”的喁喁私语，跟我们爱情的欢声笑语——如此真实，十年不变！——相比，让我对婚姻产生了一种极大的蔑视。我从来都没有如此近距离接触过这类事情。啊，最最亲爱的！世人称之为“失足”的东西，会比法律更紧密地将两个人连在一起——不是吗？","Has the duke obtained for me the thing we wanted; and shall you, my dearest life, be ordered to drink the Baden waters next year?The billing and cooing of the “handsome disconsolate,” compared with the accents of our happy love—so true and changeless for now ten years!—have given me a great contempt for marriage.I had never seen the thing so near.Ah, dearest! what the world calls a “false step” brings two beings nearer together than the law—does it not?"
"后面两页的中心思想是对往事的追忆和强烈的愿望，有点过于亲密，就不好公开了。","The concluding idea served as a text for two pages of reminiscences and aspirations a little too confidential for publication."
"就在卡那利将这封信投进邮筒的前一天晚上，比查，也就是假冒的让·雅克曼，收到了他的假表妹菲罗塞娜的信。这样，他的回信就比诗人的信早了十二个小时寄出。公爵夫人半个月来极为不安，又被梅尔基奥尔的杳无音信伤透了心，于是她命菲罗塞娜写一封信给她表哥，信的内容由她亲自口述。而比查的回信过于直白，伤到了她五十岁人的自尊心。她一读完信，就派人请来银行家蒙日诺，并细致询问了米尼翁先生的确切财产。爱莱奥诺尔发现自己因为几百万而被人背叛、抛弃，气愤、仇恨，以及冷酷的报复情绪突然发作。菲罗塞娜敲了敲那间奢华卧房的门，走进去时发现她的女主人泪眼婆娑——这是她服侍女主人十五年来从未有过的情况。她站在那里，目瞪口呆。","The evening before the day on which Canalis put the above epistle into the post, Butscha, under the name of Jean Jacmin, had received a letter from his fictitious cousin, Philoxene, and had mailed his answer, which thus preceded the letter of the poet by about twelve hours.Terribly anxious for the last two weeks, and wounded by Melchior’s silence, the duchess herself dictated Philoxene’s letter to her cousin, and the moment she had read the answer, rather too explicit for her quinquagenary vanity, she sent for the banker and made close inquiries as to the exact fortune of Monsieur Mignon.Finding herself betrayed and abandoned for the millions, Eleonore gave way to a paroxysm of anger, hatred, and cold vindictiveness.Philoxene knocked at the door of the sumptuous room, and entering found her mistress with her eyes full of tears,—so unprecedented a phenomenon in the fifteen years she had waited upon her that the woman stopped short stupefied."
"“十分钟就把十年的幸福给毁了。”她听公爵夫人说道。","“We expiate the happiness of ten years in ten minutes,” she heard the duchess say."
"“夫人，一封勒阿弗尔来的信。”","“A letter from Havre, madame.”"
"埃莱奥诺尔读着诗人的信，都没有注意到菲罗塞娜在场。菲罗塞娜见公爵夫人读着读着，脸上又恢复了平静，便感到更为惊讶了。递一根手杖粗细的棍子给一个将要被淹死的人，他就会将其视为一条平安大道。埃莱奥诺尔读过那四页爱情与交易、谎言与真相相互交织的信之后，幸福的她相信卡那利是真心诚意的。就在早些时候，她还让丈夫去阻止对梅尔基奥尔的任命，趁时间还来得及。现在，她又被一种近乎伟大的宽宏大量精神左右了。","Eleonore read the poet’s prose without noticing the presence of Philoxene, whose amazement became still greater when she saw the dawn of fresh serenity on the duchess’s face as she read further and further into the letter.Hold out a pole no thicker than a walking-stick to a drowning man, and he will think it a high-road of safety.The happy Eleonore believed in Canalis’s good faith when she had read through the four pages in which love and business, falsehood and truth, jostled each other.She who, a few moments earlier, had sent for her husband to prevent Melchior’s appointment while there was still time, was now seized with a spirit of generosity that amounted almost to the sublime."
"“可怜的小伙子！”她心想，“他一点儿不老实的想法都没有，他还是跟第一天那样爱我，他告诉了我全部情况——菲罗塞娜！”她注意到女仆正站在她附近假装收拾梳妆台，便叫道。","“Poor fellow!” she thought; “he has not had one faithless thought; he loves me as he did on the first day; he tells me all—Philoxene!” she cried, noticing her maid, who was standing near and pretending to arrange the toilet-table."
"“公爵夫人有何吩咐？”","“Madame la duchesse?”"
"“把镜子给我，孩子！”","“A mirror, child!”"
"埃莱奥诺尔揽镜自照，看见额头上延伸着一道道刀割般的皱纹。她叹了口气，在那叹惜声中，她感觉自己要向爱情告别了。她抛开所有女人的小心眼儿，想到了一个颇具男子气概的大胆主意——这个想法让她自我陶醉了好一会儿，或许也可以解释俄国的塞米勒米斯为什么宽宏大量地将她年轻漂亮的情敌嫁给了马莫诺夫。","Eleonore looked at herself, saw the fine razor-like lines traced on her brow, which disappeared at a little distance; she sighed, and in that sigh she felt she bade adieu to love.A brave thought came into her mind, a manly thought, outside of all the pettiness of women,—a thought which intoxicates for a moment, and which explains, perhaps, the clemency of the Semiramis of Russia when she married her young and beautiful rival to Momonoff."
"“既然他没有对我不忠，他倒可以把那个姑娘和她的几百万弄到手，”她想道，——“前提是米尼翁小姐的确像他所说的那样丑。”","“Since he has not been faithless, he shall have the girl and her millions,” she thought,—“provided Mademoiselle Mignon is as ugly as he says she is.”"
"有人在门上轻轻地敲了三下，这是公爵到了，妻子便自己过去给他开门。","Three raps, circumspectly given, announced the duke, and his wife went herself to the door to let him in."
"“啊！你好些了，我亲爱的。”他假装欢喜地叫道，凡是拍马屁的人都会这一套，而傻瓜见了就要上当了。","“Ah! I see you are better, my dear,” he cried, with the counterfeit joy that courtiers assume so readily, and by which fools are so readily taken in."
"“我亲爱的亨利，”她回答说，“你为什么还没有把梅尔基奥尔的任命弄好呢？——你已经在内阁里为国王效力了那么多，而你也知道，这内阁是只能呆一年的。”","“My dear Henri,” she answered, “why is it you have not yet obtained that appointment for Melchior,—you who sacrificed so much to the king in taking a ministry which you knew could only last one year.”"
"公爵瞥了一眼菲罗塞娜，她用一个别人几乎察觉不到的手势，示意梳妆台上有封勒阿弗尔的来信。","The duke glanced at Philoxene, who showed him by an almost imperceptible sign the letter from Havre on the dressing-table."
"“你到巴登去会烦死的，而且回来会跟梅尔基奥尔闹翻的。”公爵说。","“You would be terribly bored at Baden and come back at daggers drawn with Melchior,” said the duke."
"“请问为什么呀？”","“Pray why?”"
"“哎呀，你们会总在一起的。”这位前任外交官高兴地说道，那副好脾气的样子让人看了好笑。","“Why, you would always be together,” said the former diplomat, with comic good-humor."
"“唉，不，”她说，“我就要让他结婚了。”","“Oh, no,” she said; “I am going to marry him.”"
"“如果德埃鲁维尔的话可信，那我们亲爱的卡那利在这方面就不需要你的帮助了。”公爵笑着说道，“昨天，葛朗利厄把马厩大总管给他写的信给我念了几页。毫无疑问，这些话是大总管的姑妈指使他针对你而写的，因为德埃鲁维尔小姐总是在为她的侄子谋嫁妆，她又知道葛朗利厄几乎每天晚上都要和我玩惠斯特牌。善良的小德埃鲁维尔想让德卡迪央亲王去诺曼底组织一次皇家围猎，而且让他尽量说服国王到场。这样，这位小姐看到如此盛大的活动是为她举办的，就会飘飘然起来。总之，查理十世说两句话，这件事就成了。德埃鲁维尔说这个女孩子漂亮得无人能比——”","“If we can believe d’Herouville, our dear Canalis stands in no need of your help in that direction,” said the duke, smiling.“Yesterday Grandlieu read me some passages from a letter the grand equerry had written him.No doubt they were dictated by the aunt for the express purpose of their reaching you, for Mademoiselle d’Herouville, always on the scent of a ‘dot,’ knows that Grandlieu and I play whist nearly every evening.That good little d’Herouville wants the Prince de Cadignan to go down and give a royal hunt in Normandy, and endeavor to persuade the king to be present, so as to turn the head of the damozel when she sees herself the object of such a grand affair.In short, two words from Charles X. would settle the matter.D’Herouville says the girl has incomparable beauty—”"
"“亨利，我们去勒阿弗尔吧！”公爵夫人打断他，叫道。","“Henri, let us go to Havre!” cried the duchess, interrupting him."
"“以什么借口去呢？”她丈夫严肃地说。他是路易十八的心腹之一。","“Under what pretext?” said her husband, gravely; he was one of the confidants of Louis XVIII."
"“我从未看过围猎。”","“I never saw a hunt.”"
"“要是国王去的话，那倒很好。可路太远了，实在是太麻烦了，他是不会去的，我刚刚就一直在跟他说这件事。”","“It would be all very well if the king went; but it is a terrible bore to go so far, and he will not do it; I have just been speaking with him about it.”"
"“夫人可能会去吧？”","“Perhaps Madame would go?”"
"“那样更好了，”公爵回答说，“我敢保证摩弗里纽斯公爵夫人会帮你说服她从罗斯尼城堡过去的。如果她去的话，那国王就不会不高兴别人用他围猎的随从和装备了。别去勒阿弗尔了，亲爱的，”公爵慈父般地补充道，“那样你会露馅的。听我说，我觉得有个更好的计划。加斯帕尔的罗桑布赖城堡就在布罗托纳森林对面，为什么不暗示他邀请那帮人呢？”","“That would be better,” returned the duke, “I dare say the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse would help you to persuade her from Rosny.If she goes the king will not be displeased at the use of his hunting equipage.Don’t go to Havre, my dear,” added the duke, paternally, “that would be giving yourself away.Come, here’s a better plan, I think.Gaspard’s chateau of Rosembray is on the other side of the forest of Brotonne; why not give him a hint to invite the whole party?”"
"“让他邀请他们？”爱莱奥诺尔说。","“He invite them?” said Eleonore."
"“当然，我的意思是说让公爵夫人邀请他们。她一直和德埃鲁维尔小姐一起从事慈善工作，给那个老小姐一点暗示，让她去跟加斯帕尔说。”","“I mean, of course, the duchess; she is always engaged in pious works with Mademoiselle d’Herouville; give that old maid a hint, and get her to speak to Gaspard.”"
"“你真是一个招人爱的男人，”埃莱奥诺尔叫道，“我马上就给这位老小姐和迪亚娜写信，因为我们还要准备好行头——戴一顶骑帽会很好看的。你昨晚在英国大使那边赢了吗？”","“You are a love of a man,” cried Eleonore; “I’ll write to the old maid and to Diane at once, for we must get hunting things made,—a riding hat is so becoming.Did you win last night at the English embassy?”"
"“赢了，”公爵说，“我把欠的债都还清了。”","“Yes,” said the duke; “I cleared myself.”"
"“亨利，最重要的是，暂停对梅尔基奥尔的两项任命的相关事宜。”","“Henri, above all things, stop proceedings about Melchior’s two appointments.”"
"埃莱奥诺尔给漂亮的迪亚娜·德摩弗里纽斯写了一封五六行字的短笺，又给德埃鲁维尔小姐写了一封短信暗示她，然后就写了下面这封回信，像马鞭一样抽在了诗人的谎言上。","After writing half a dozen lines to the beautiful Diane de Maufrigneuse, and a short hint to Mademoiselle d’Herouville, Eleonore sent the following answer like the lash of a whip through the poet’s lies."
"致德卡那利男爵先生：","To Monsieur le Baron de Canalis:—"
"我亲爱的诗人——德拉巴斯蒂小姐十分漂亮；蒙日诺已经向我证实，她的父亲有几百万。我确实曾想过让您同她结婚，因此，您对我的不信任让我很不高兴。要是您在去勒阿弗尔的时候就打算让拉布里埃跟她结婚，那就奇怪了，您在走之前竟然什么都没跟我说过。还有，像我这么一个爱着急的朋友，您为什么会忘记给她写信呢？您的信晚来了一小会儿，我之前已经见过银行家了。您只是个孩子，梅尔基奥尔，而您还跟我们玩花样。这样不对。公爵自己也对您的行为十分恼火，他觉得您的行为有损绅士风度，这也有损您母亲的名誉。","My dear poet,—Mademoiselle de La Bastie is very beautiful; Mongenod has proved to me that her father has millions.I did think of marrying you to her; I am therefore much displeased at your want of confidence.If you had any intention of marrying La Briere when you went to Havre it is surprising that you said nothing to me about it before you started.And why have you omitted writing to a friend who is so easily made anxious as I?Your letter arrived a trifle late; I had already seen the banker.You are a child, Melchior, and you are playing tricks with us.It is not right.The duke himself is quite indignant at your proceedings; he thinks you less than a gentleman, which casts some reflections on your mother’s honor."
"现在，我准备亲眼去看看到底是怎么回事。我相信，我会有幸陪夫人去参加由德埃鲁维尔公爵提议、为德拉巴斯蒂小姐举办的围猎。我会想办法让您被邀去罗桑布赖，因为聚会很可能会在德韦纳伊公爵的庄园里举行。","Now, I intend to see things for myself.I shall, I believe, have the honor of accompanying Madame to the hunt which the Duc d’Herouville proposes to give for Mademoiselle de La Bastie.I will manage to have you invited to Rosembray, for the meet will probably take place in Duc de Verneuil’s park."
"请相信，我亲爱的诗人，我终身仍是，","Pray believe, my dear poet, that I am none the less, for life,"
"您的朋友，埃莱奥诺尔·德莫","Your friend, Eleonore de M."
"“得了，埃内斯特，你看看！”卡那利大叫道，将这封信扔过餐桌，让它飞到埃内斯特的鼻子下，“这是那个女人写给我的第两千封情书，可里面连个‘你’字都没有。大名鼎鼎的埃莱奥诺尔从来都没这样客气过。结婚吧，试试你的运气！世界上最坏的婚姻也比这种束缚要强。啊，我是从月亮上掉下来的最伟大的尼柯代默！莫黛斯特有几百万，可我已经失去了她，因为我们如今是在极地，不能在回到三天前的热带了！唔，我更迫切地希望你能战胜马厩大总管了，因为我告诉公爵夫人我来这里只是为了你，因此，我会尽力帮助你的。”","“There, Ernest, just look at that!” cried Canalis, tossing the letter at Ernest’s nose across the breakfast-table; “that’s the two thousandth love-letter I have had from that woman, and there isn’t even a ‘thou’ in it.The illustrious Eleonore has never compromised herself more than she does there.Marry, and try your luck!The worst marriage in the world is better than this sort of halter.Ah, I am the greatest Nicodemus that ever tumbled out of the moon!Modeste has millions, and I’ve lost her; for we can’t get back from the poles, where we are today, to the tropics, where we were three days ago!Well, I am all the more anxious for your triumph over the grand equerry, because I told the duchess I came here only for your sake; and so I shall do my best for you.”"
"“哎，梅尔基奥尔，莫黛斯特得有多么高贵、多么伟大、多么成熟的品格，才能抵挡住宫廷的荣誉、以及公爵为她精心安排的气派场面的诱惑啊，我不敢相信有那么完美的人——不过，如果她还是她信中的那个莫黛斯特的话，也许还有希望！”","“Alas, Melchior, Modeste must needs have so noble, so grand, so well-balanced a nature to resist the glories of the Court, and all these splendors cleverly displayed for her honor and glory by the duke, that I cannot believe in the existence of such perfection,—and yet, if she is still the Modeste of her letters, there might be hope!”"
"“好了，好了，你这个年轻的卜尼法斯，你是个幸福的小伙子，能用你那青涩稚嫩的眼神看待这个世界和你的情人！”卡那利一边叫着，一边到花园里踱步去了。","“Well, well, you are a happy fellow, you young Boniface, to see the world and your mistress through green spectacles!” cried Canalis, marching off to pace up and down the garden."
"两边撒的谎都被拆穿了，这位诗人不知所措了。","Caught between two lies, the poet was at a loss what to do."
"“按规矩出牌，你就输了！”没过多久，他坐在亭子里大叫道，“每个有理智的人都会像我四天前那样做的，发现自己陷入圈套了，就要逃出来。这种时候，人们是不会去解网结的，只会破网而出！好了，镇定、冷静，表现出高贵的、被冒犯的样子。荣誉要求我这样做；英国式的强硬态度才是赢回她的唯一办法。毕竟，就算我最终不得不退出，我也总能回到原来的幸福，十年的忠诚是不可能没有任何回报的。埃莱奥诺尔会给我安排一门好亲事的。”","“Play by rule, and you lose!” he cried presently, sitting down in the kiosk.“Every man of sense would have acted as I did four days ago, and got himself out of the net in which I saw myself.At such times people don’t disentangle nets, they break through them!Come, let us be calm, cold, dignified, affronted.Honor requires it; English stiffness is the only way to win her back.After all, if I have to retire finally, I can always fall back on my old happiness; a fidelity of ten years can’t go unrewarded.Eleonore will arrange me some good marriage.”"
"第二十六章 真正的爱情","Chapter XXVI True Love"
"这次围猎注定不仅仅是一场猎犬的聚会，而是一次由中校的几百万财产和莫黛斯特的美貌所激起的感情大会战。而在等待围猎的过程中，情敌们也休战了。在为这场林中盛会做必要准备的这几天里，米尼翁公馆的客厅里呈现出了一幅和睦家庭的平静画面。卡那利不再扮演那个被莫黛斯特敏锐的洞察力所伤害的情人角色了，而是希望表现得彬彬有礼。他放下了自命不凡的姿态，也不再表现他的能言善辩，而是变成了所有聪明人放弃了装腔作势后的样子，十分有魅力。他同哥本海姆谈论金融，同中校谈论战争，同米尼翁夫人谈论德国，还同拉图奈尔夫人谈论家务——试图让他们所有人的偏爱都转移到拉布里埃身上。德埃鲁维尔公爵把地盘让给了他的两个情敌，因为他要去罗桑布赖和韦纳伊公爵商量，确保皇家猎队队长卡迪央亲王的命令得以执行。然而，整个事态的发展仍不乏喜剧元素。卡那利对马厩大总管的殷勤流露出鄙视态度，而两位德埃鲁维尔小姐每晚都在公馆度过，不停地夸夸其谈，莫黛斯特就被夹在了这两股火力之间。卡那利让莫黛斯特意识到，她不但不会在猎场上成为女主角，而且几乎不会被注意到。夫人将会在卡迪央亲王的儿媳德摩弗里纽斯公爵夫人、德肖利厄公爵夫人，以及其他宫廷贵妇的陪同下参加围猎，在这些人当中，莫黛斯特是不会引起任何轰动的；毫无疑问，驻扎在鲁昂的部队军官们也会被邀请，等等。而另一边，埃莱娜已经把她当作自己的弟媳妇了，她不停地告诉她的新朋友，会把她介绍给夫人；毫无疑问，德韦纳伊公爵会邀请她和她的父亲在罗桑布赖小住；如果中校想得到国王的恩赐——比如说，一个贵族头衔——这可是千载难逢的机会，因为国王有可能会在第三天出现；漂亮的宫廷贵妇德肖利厄公爵夫人、德莫弗里纽斯公爵夫人、德勒农库-肖利厄公爵夫人，以及其她女士都想见见她，她们的热情接待会让她十分高兴的。事实上，这场小小战事的发展、反复，以及各种计谋，的确非常有趣——这一切把迪迈一家、拉图奈尔一家、哥本海姆和比查给乐坏了，他们私下里聚在一起，说着有关这些贵族的坏话，对他们的一切卑鄙行为进行仔细研究和挖苦评论。","The hunt was destined to be not only a meet of the hounds, but a meeting of all the passions excited by the colonel’s millions and Modeste’s beauty; and while it was in prospect there was truce between the adversaries.During the days required for the arrangement of this forestrial solemnity, the salon of the villa Mignon presented the tranquil picture of a united family.Canalis, cut short in his role of injured love by Modeste’s quick perceptions, wished to appear courteous; he laid aside his pretensions, gave no further specimens of his oratory, and became, what all men of intellect can be when they renounce affectation, perfectly charming.He talked finances with Gobenheim, and war with the colonel, Germany with Madame Mignon, and housekeeping with Madame Latournelle,—endeavoring to bias them all in favor of La Briere.The Duc d’Herouville left the field to his rivals, for he was obliged to go to Rosembray to consult with the Duc de Verneuil, and see that the orders of the Royal Huntsman, the Prince de Cadignan, were carried out.And yet the comic element was not altogether wanting.Modeste found herself between the depreciatory hints of Canalis as to the gallantry of the grand equerry, and the exaggerations of the two Mesdemoiselles d’Herouville, who passed every evening at the villa.Canalis made Modeste take notice that, instead of being the heroine of the hunt, she would be scarcely noticed.Madame would be attended by the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse, daughter-inlaw of the Prince de Cadignan, by the Duchesse de Chaulieu, and other great ladies of the Court, among whom she could produce no sensation; no doubt the officers in garrison at Rouen would be invited, etc.Helene, on the other hand, was incessantly telling her new friend, whom she already looked upon as a sister-inlaw, that she was to be presented to Madame; undoubtedly the Duc de Verneuil would invite her father and herself to stay at Rosembray; if the colonel wished to obtain a favor of the king,—a peerage, for instance,—the opportunity was unique, for there was hope of the king himself being present on the third day; she would be delighted with the charming welcome with which the beauties of the Court, the Duchesses de Chaulieu, de Maufrigneuse, de Lenoncourt-Chaulieu, and other ladies, were prepared to meet her.It was in fact an excessively amusing little warfare, with its marches and countermarches and stratagems,—all of which were keenly enjoyed by the Dumays, the Latournelles, Gobenheim, and Butscha, who, in conclave assembled, said horrible things of these noble personages, cruelly noting and intelligently studying all their little meannesses."
"不过，德埃鲁维尔一方所作的承诺由一份充满溢美之辞的请帖的到来得到了证实。请帖是德韦纳伊公爵和猎队队长给德拉巴斯蒂伯爵先生和他的女儿发来的，邀请他们去罗桑布赖小住，并于十一月十七、十八、十九和二十号这几天参加一场大型狩猎活动。","The promises on the d’Herouville side were, however, confirmed by the arrival of an invitation, couched in flattering terms, from the Duc de Verneuil and the Master of the Hunt to Monsieur le Comte de La Bastie and his daughter, to stay at Rosembray and be present at a grand hunt on the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth, of November following."
"拉布里埃心里充满了不祥的预感，热切渴望着和莫黛斯特呆在一起。这种辛酸的快乐，只有那些感到要与所爱之人分离、而且是命中注定要分离的情人，才能了解。快乐的火花，混杂着对“我失去了她”这个主题的忧思，让那些观察他的人更觉得有趣了，因为他的脸、他的整个人，都沉浸在那深沉的情感中。一首活生生的哀歌，被一双眼睛赋予了生命，它在人群中自由漫步，发出无韵的叹息，再没有什么比这更有诗意了。","La Briere, full of dark presentiments, craved the presence of Modeste with an eagerness whose bitter joys are known only to lovers who feel that they are parted, and parted fatally from those they love.Flashes of joy came to him intermingled with melancholy meditations on the one theme, “I have lost her,” and made him all the more interesting to those who watched him, because his face and his whole person were in keeping with his profound feeling.There is nothing more poetic than a living elegy, animated by a pair of eyes, walking about, and sighing without rhymes."
"终于，德埃鲁维尔公爵来安排莫黛斯特起程了。过了塞纳河之后，她要坐上公爵的四轮马车，由两位德埃鲁维尔小姐陪同前往。公爵十分客气，他也邀请卡那利和拉布里埃参加聚会，同时，正如向中校保证过的那样，他也向他们保证，已经特别关照过为他们准备狩猎用马。中校邀请这三位追求者在出发的那天早晨共进早餐。于是，卡那利便开始实施他过去几天在脑子里思考成熟的一项计划，也就是悄悄地夺回莫黛斯特，背弃公爵夫人、拉布里埃和公爵。一个外交毕业生，眼看自己形势不利，是不会坐以待毙的。另一方面，拉布里埃已经下定决心跟莫黛斯特永别了。因此，每个追求者都像被告在审判宣布之前作最后陈词一样，等着说出最后一句话，因为他们都感觉到三个星期来的争斗已经接近尾声了。出发的前一天晚上，晚饭过后，中校挽住他女儿的手臂，让她感觉到有必要作出决定了。","The Duc d’Herouville arrived at last to arrange for Modeste’s departure; after crossing the Seine she was to be conveyed in the duke’s caleche, accompanied by the Demoiselles d’Herouville.The duke was charmingly courteous, he begged Canalis and La Briere to be of the party, assuring them, as he did the colonel, that he had taken particular care that hunters should be provided for them.The colonel invited the three lovers to breakfast on the morning of the start.Canalis then began to put into execution a plan that he had been maturing in his own mind for the last few days; namely, to quietly reconquer Modeste, and throw over the duchess, La Briere, and the duke.A graduate of diplomacy could hardly remain stuck in the position in which he found himself.On the other hand La Briere had come to the resolution of bidding Modeste an eternal farewell.Each suitor was therefore on the watch to slip in a last word, like the defendant’s counsel to the court before judgment is pronounced; for all felt that the three weeks’ struggle was approaching its conclusion.After dinner on the evening before the start was to be made, the colonel had taken his daughter by the arm and made her feel the necessity of deciding."
"“到了罗桑布赖，我们同德埃鲁维尔家的关系就很难办了。”他对她说，“你愿意当公爵夫人吗？”","“Our position with the d’Herouville family will be quite intolerable at Rosembray,” he said to her.“Do you mean to be a duchess?”"
"“不愿意，父亲。”她答道。","“No, father,” she answered."
"“那你爱卡那利吗？”","“Then do you love Canalis?”"
"“不，爸爸，绝不！”她像个小孩子一样不耐烦地喊道。","“No, papa, a thousand times no!” she exclaimed with the impatience of a child."
"中校带着几分喜悦的神情看着她。","The colonel looked at her with a sort of joy."
"“啊，我可没影响过你哟，”这位实在的父亲大声说道，“现在我可以承认了，在巴黎时，我让一个小伙子相信我只有一点点财产，他就抓住我的手，跟我说我是拿掉了他思想上的一个重担——那时，我就选中了他做我的女婿。”","“Ah, I have not influenced you,” cried the true father, “and I will now confess that I chose my son-inlaw in Paris when, having made him believe that I had but little fortune, he grasped my hand and told me I took a weight from his mind—”"
"“您说的是谁？”莫黛斯特满脸绯红地问道。","“Who is it you mean?” asked Modeste, coloring."
"“那个讲原则、道德高尚的人啊。”她父亲打趣地重复着他回家后打破莫黛斯特幻梦的那句话。","“The man of fixed principles and sound moralities,” said her father, slyly, repeating the words which had dissolved poor Modeste’s dream on the day after his return."
"“我甚至都没考虑过他，爸爸。请让我自己做主，亲自回绝公爵；我了解他，知道怎么安慰他。”","“I was not even thinking of him, papa.Please leave me at liberty to refuse the duke myself; I understand him, and I know how to soothe him.”"
"“那么，你还没作出决定喽？”","“Then your choice is not made?”"
"“还没，在我命运的字谜里，还有一两个音节要去猜。但在罗桑布赖看上一眼宫廷生活后，我会告诉您我的秘密。”","“Not yet; there is another syllable or two in the charade of my destiny still to be guessed; but after I have had a glimpse of court life at Rosembray I will tell you my secret.”"
"“啊！拉布里埃先生，”中校见这位年轻人正沿他们散步的花园小径朝他们走来，便大声说道，“我想您会去参加这次狩猎吧？”","“Ah! Monsieur de La Briere,” cried the colonel, as the young man approached them along the garden path in which they were walking, “I hope you are going to this hunt?”"
"“不，中校，”埃内斯特回答说，“我是过来向您和小姐辞行的，我要回巴黎了——”","“No, colonel,” answered Ernest.“I have come to take leave of you and of mademoiselle; I return to Paris—”"
"“您真是没有好奇心。”莫黛斯特打断他，看着他说道。","“You have no curiosity,” said Modeste, interrupting, and looking at him."
"“只要你们有这个愿望，就足够让我留下，但我不敢指望。”他回答说。","“A wish—that I cannot expect—would suffice to keep me,” he replied."
"“如果这么简单的话，您就一定要留下，那样我会高兴的，我希望您留下。”中校说道，然后就去见卡那利了，让女儿和拉布里埃单独呆一会儿。","“If that is all, you must stay to please me; I wish it,” said the colonel, going forward to meet Canalis, and leaving his daughter and La Briere together for a moment."
"“小姐，”这位年轻人以一个无望之人的勇敢，抬眼看着她，说道，“我对您有个请求。”","“Mademoiselle,” said the young man, raising his eyes to hers with the boldness of a man without hope, “I have an entreaty to make to you.”"
"“对我？”","“To me?”"
"“请让我带着您的原谅离开吧。我永远都不会幸福了，因为失去了幸福，我的人生一定会充满悔恨——这无疑是我自己的过错；但是，至少——”","“Let me carry away with me your forgiveness.My life can never be happy; it must be full of remorse for having lost my happiness—no doubt by my own fault; but, at least,—”"
"“在我们永别之前，”莫黛斯特像以卡那利式的风格打断他的话，有些动情地说道，“我想问您一件事。尽管您曾经偷名换姓，但我想您不会这么卑鄙，现在还欺骗我。”","“Before we part forever,” said Modeste, interrupting a la Canalis, and speaking in a voice of some emotion, “I wish to ask you one thing; and though you once disguised yourself, I think you cannot be so base as to deceive me now.”"
"这句嘲讽让他顿时脸色苍白，他大叫道：“唉，您还真是无情啊！”","The taunt made him turn pale, and he cried out, “Oh, you are pitiless!”"
"“您会坦白地说吗？”","“Will you be frank?”"
"“您有权问我那个丢脸的问题。”他说道，声音由于剧烈的心跳都变弱了。","“You have the right to ask me that degrading question,” he said, in a voice weakened by the violent palpitation of his heart."
"“那好，您有没有将我的信读给卡那利先生听？”","“Well, then, did you read my letters to Monsieur de Canalis?”"
"“没有，小姐；而且我让您父亲看那些信，是为了告诉他我的爱情是怎样产生的，我又是怎样真诚努力去治愈您的幻想之症，以此来为我的爱情辩护。”","“No, mademoiselle; and I allowed your father to read them it was to justify my love by showing him how it was born, and how sincere my efforts were to cure you of your fancy.”"
"“但那个卑鄙的冒名顶替的主意，又是怎么来的呢？”她有点不耐烦地说道。","“But how came the idea of that unworthy masquerade ever to arise?” she said, with a sort of impatience."
"拉布里埃一五一十地讲述了莫黛斯特的第一封信到来时发生在诗人书房的那一幕，还有他如何赞许这样一位被诗人的名声所吸引的少女，说她像一株寻找阳光的植物，结果卡那利就怂恿他接受了这个挑战。","La Briere related truthfully the scene in the poet’s study which Modeste’s first letter had occasioned, and the sort of challenge that resulted from his expressing a favorable opinion of a young girl thus led toward a poet’s fame, as a plant seeks its share of the sun."
"“够了，”莫黛斯特抑制住激动的情绪，说道，“虽然您没得到我的心，先生，但您至少得到了我的敬重。”","“You have said enough,” said Modeste, restraining some emotion.“If you have not my heart, monsieur, you have at least my esteem.”"
"这些简单的话语给了这位年轻人沉重一击，他感觉浑身晃悠，像个暂时失去知觉的人一样靠在了一棵树上。莫黛斯特本来已经离他而去，又转过头来，急匆匆地跑回他身边。","These simple words gave the young man a violent shock; feeling himself stagger, he leaned against a tree, like a man deprived for a moment of reason.Modest, who had left him, turned her head and came hastily back."
"“您怎么了？”她一边问道，一边抓住他的手，防止他倒下去。","“What is the matter?” she asked, taking his hand to prevent him from falling."
"“对不起——我本以为您瞧不起我。”","“Forgive me—I thought you despised me.”"
"“但是，”她以一种疏远高傲的态度回答说，“我也没说我爱您啊。”","“But,” she answered, with a distant and disdainful manner, “I did not say that I loved you.”"
"然后，她又离他而去了。但这一次，尽管她说的话很无情，拉布里埃还是感觉像是在云中漫步，脚下的大地变软了，树木开满了鲜花，天空是玫瑰色的，空气是蔚蓝色的，就像置身结局圆满的那些精灵童话剧中的婚姻神殿。在这种情况下，每个女人都是一位两面神杰纳斯，不用转过身去就可以看到身后的事情。因此，莫黛斯特在她情人的脸上看到了像比查那样的不容置疑的爱情症候——这在一个女子的希望中当然是“ne plus ultra”的事情。另外，拉布里埃把她的评价看得极重，这让莫黛斯特内心充满了无限的甜蜜。","And she left him again.But this time, in spite of her harshness, La Briere thought he walked on air; the earth softened under his feet, the trees bore flowers; the skies were rosy, the air cerulean, as they are in the temples of Hymen in those fairy pantomimes which finish happily.In such situations every woman is a Janus, and sees behind her without turning round; and thus Modeste perceived on the face of her lover the indubitable symptoms of a love like Butscha’s,—surely the “ne plus ultra” of a woman’s hope.Moreover, the great value which La Briere attached to her opinion filled Modeste with an emotion that was inestimably sweet."
"“小姐，”卡那利离开中校，拦住莫黛斯特说道，“尽管您对我的感情不屑一顾，但我要将一个我已经忍受很久的污点抹去，为我的荣誉正名。这是我到勒阿弗尔五天后，德肖利厄公爵夫人给我写的一封信。”","“Mademoiselle,” said Canalis, leaving the colonel and waylaying Modeste, “in spite of the little value you attach to my sentiments, my honor is concerned in effacing a stain under which I have suffered too long.Here is a letter which I received from the Duchesse de Chaulieu five days after my arrival in Havre.”"
"他让莫黛斯特看了我们已经看过的那封信的头几行，公爵夫人在信的开头说她已经见过了蒙日诺，并希望让她的诗人同莫黛斯特结婚。然后，他把那一段话撕了下来，把纸片放到了她的手里。","He let Modeste read the first lines of the letter we have seen, which the duchess began by saying that she had seen Mongenod, and now wished to marry her poet to Modeste; then he tore that passage from the body of the letter, and placed the fragment in her hand."
"“其余的部分我不能让您看，”他一边说着，一边将信纸放到口袋里，“但我把这几行交给您自行处理，以便您核实笔迹。一个可以指责我情感卑鄙的少女，也完全有可能怀疑这是某种串通，某种诡计。啊，莫黛斯特，”他带着哭腔说道，“您的诗人，德肖利厄夫人的诗人，他内心的诗意并不比他思想中的少。您就要见到公爵夫人了，请到那时再对我作出判断吧。”","“I cannot let you read the rest,” he said, putting the paper in his pocket; “but I confide these few lines to your discretion, so that you may verify the writing.A young girl who could accuse me of ignoble sentiments is quite capable of suspecting some collusion, some trickery.Ah, Modeste,” he said, with tears in his voice, “your poet, the poet of Madame de Chaulieu, has no less poetry in his heart than in his mind.You are about to see the duchess; suspend your judgment of me till then.”"
"他丢下有些迷惑不解的莫黛斯特，走了。","He left Modeste half bewildered."
"“唉，天哪！”她自言自语道，“他们看上去都是天使——却嫁不得，只有公爵还算是人类。”","“Oh, dear!” she said to herself; “it seems they are all angels—and not marriageable; the duke is the only one that belongs to humanity.”"
"“莫黛斯特小姐，”比查胳膊夹着一个包裹出现，说道，“这次的狩猎让我很是心神不安。我梦见您的马把您带走了，便到鲁昂去看能不能买到一只西班牙马嚼子，他们告诉我，马戴上这个就不能咬断缰绳。请您用上它吧。我已经把它给中校看过了，他还感谢我，其实这不算什么的。”","“Mademoiselle Modeste,” said Butscha, appearing with a parcel under his arm, “this hunt makes me very uneasy.I dreamed your horse ran away with you, and I have been to Rouen to see if I could get a Spanish bit which, they tell me, a horse can’t take between his teeth.I entreat you to use it.I have shown it to the colonel, and he has thanked me more than there is any occasion for.”"
"“可怜的亲爱的比查！”莫黛斯特叫道，她被这种母性般的关怀感动得流泪了。","“Poor, dear Butscha!” cried Modeste, moved to tears by this maternal care."
"比查活蹦乱跳地走了，就像刚刚听说他一位有钱的叔叔过世了似的。","Butscha went skipping off like a man who has just heard of the death of a rich uncle."
"“我亲爱的爸爸，”莫黛斯特回到客厅里说道，“我想要那只漂亮的马鞭——您看能不能请求拉布里埃先生用您那幅凡奥斯塔德的油画来交换。”","“My dear father,” said Modeste, returning to the salon; “I should like to have that beautiful whip,—suppose you were to ask Monsieur de La Briere to exchange it for your picture by Van Ostade.”"
"这幅画是中校从雷根斯堡一位市民那里买来的，是他征战生涯的唯一纪念品。他站在画前，向埃内斯特提出这个建议，而莫黛斯特一直暗暗地注视着埃内斯特。他匆忙离开房间时，她对自己说道：“他会参加狩猎的。”","Modeste looked furtively at Ernest, while the colonel made him this proposition, standing before the picture which was the sole thing he possessed in memory of his campaigns, having bought it of a burgher at Rabiston; and she said to herself as La Briere left the room precipitately, “He will be at the hunt.”"
"真是一件稀奇的事。莫黛斯特的三位情人都去了罗桑布赖，每个人心中都充满了希望，并为她的许多完美之处心醉神迷。","A curious thing happened.Modeste’s three lovers each and all went to Rosembray with their hearts full of hope, and captivated by her many perfections."
"议会投票决定拨十亿法郎，用以补偿流亡贵族地产的出售。德韦纳伊公爵最近用他得到的这一份钱买下了罗桑布赖这份地产，它的城堡远近闻名，壮丽程度只有麦斯尼埃或巴勒鲁瓦的城堡才能与之媲美。经过一条植有四排古老榆树的宽阔林荫道，就到了这座气势宏伟、高贵壮丽的建筑，接着，来访者们便进入了一个与凡尔赛宫庭院相似的上坡大庭院，华贵的铁栅栏，两栋门房小屋，装点着几排种在大盆中的大橘树。城堡面向庭院，主建筑的两边各有一座凹进去的入口。城堡的凸出部分有两排大窗户，每排十九扇，装饰着雕花拱顶和镶钻窗格，窗与窗之间由一根根凹槽壁柱分开，柱顶上带有楣构，意大利式的屋顶隐于其中。屋顶上竖立着几根石烟囱，上面雕饰着武器图案。罗桑布赖是路易十四时代一位叫作科坦的农庄主建造的。面向花园的一面与面向庭院的一面不同，中间的凸起部分较窄，五扇窗户中间间隔着壁柱，窗户上竖立着一面壮丽的山墙。农庄主科坦的唯一女嗣科坦小姐结婚后，这座庄园便归马里尼家族所有了。马里尼家族又让夸瑟沃在山墙上雕刻了一幅日出图。下面是两个天使，正在展开一幅卷轴，卷轴上刻着歌颂伟大君王的铭言，“Sol nobis benignus.”","Rosembray,—an estate lately purchased by the Duc de Verneuil, with the money which fell to him as his share of the thousand millions voted as indemnity for the sale of the lands of the emigres,—is remarkable for its chateau, whose magnificence compares only with that of Mesniere or of Balleroy.This imposing and noble edifice is approached by a wide avenue of four rows of venerable elms, from which the visitor enters an immense rising court-yard, like that at Versailles, with magnificent iron railings and two lodges, and adorned with rows of large orange-trees in their tubs.Facing this court-yard, the chateau presents, between two fronts of the main building which retreat on either side of this projection, a double row of nineteen tall windows, with carved arches and diamond panes, divided from each other by a series of fluted pilasters surmounted by an entablature which hides an Italian roof, from which rise several stone chimneys masked by carved trophies of arms.Rosembray was built, under Louis XIV., by a “fermier-general” named Cottin.The facade toward the park differs from that on the court-yard by having a narrower projection in the centre, with columns between five windows, above which rises a magnificent pediment.The family of Marigny, to whom the estates of this Cottin were brought in marriage by Mademoiselle Cottin, her father’s sole heiress, ordered a sunrise to be carved on this pediment by Coysevox.Beneath it are two angels unwinding a scroll, on which is cut this motto in honor of the Grand Monarch, “Sol nobis benignus.”"
"沿着大回旋梯和扶手梯，就到了平台上，从上面可以看到一座巨大的鱼塘，其长度和宽度可以与凡尔赛的大运河相媲美。池塘的源头是一片草地，足以比得上最好的英国草坪。池塘边摆满了花坛和花篮，此时正开满秋季的各种鲜艳花朵。水塘两侧各有一座法式花园，铺展着方方正正的花坛和长长的笔直小径，就像是用勒诺特尔密码写出的美妙篇章。整座花园的后沿与大约三十英亩的林地接壤。站在平台上，视野尽头是一片属于罗桑布赖的森林，毗邻的两片森林一片属于王室，另一片属于国家。恐怕很难再找到一片比这更为壮观的景色了。","From the portico, reached by two grand circular and balustraded flights of steps, the view extends over an immense fish-pond, as long and wide as the grand canal at Versailles, beginning at the foot of a grass-plot which compares well with the finest English lawns, and bordered with beds and baskets now filled with the brilliant flowers of autumn.On either side of the piece of water two gardens, laid out in the French style, display their squares and long straight paths, like brilliant pages written in the ciphers of Lenotre.These gardens are backed to their whole length by a border of nearly thirty acres of woodland.From the terrace the view is bounded by a forest belonging to Rosembray and contiguous to two other forests, one of which belongs to the Crown, the other to the State.It would be difficult to find a nobler landscape."
"第二十七章 少女的复仇","Chapter XXVII A Girl’s Revenge"
"莫黛斯特的到来在林阴道上引起了一定的轰动。只见一辆有法国国王侍从跟随的马车，由马厩大总管、中校、卡那利和拉布里埃骑马陪同，在身穿礼服的骑马侍从的引导下，出现在了人们的视线中，后面跟着六个仆人——其中有黑人和黑白混血儿——还有中校的敞篷四轮马车，载着两名贴身女仆和行李。马车是由四匹马拉的，还依照马厩大总管的特别命令，换上了穿着十分雅致的左马驭者。人们服侍大总管常常要比服侍国王更周到。至于莫黛斯特，她进去后看着这座小型的凡尔赛宫，那些大贵族的华丽服饰让她眼花缭乱。她突然想起马上要跟那些大名鼎鼎的公爵夫人们见面，便开始担心会表现得笨拙、土气，或者像个女暴发户。事实上，她已经无法镇定下来，并对要求这次狩猎后悔不已。","Modeste’s arrival at Rosembray made a certain sensation in the avenue when the carriage with the liveries of France came in sight, accompanied by the grand equerry, the colonel, Canalis, and La Briere on horseback, preceded by an outrider in full dress, and followed by six servants,—among whom were the Negroes and the mulatto,—and the britzka of the colonel for the two waiting-women and the luggage.The carriage was drawn by four horses, ridden by postilions dressed with an elegance specially commanded by the grand equerry, who was often better served than the king himself.As Modeste, dazzled by the magnificence of the great lords, entered and beheld this lesser Versailles, she suddenly remembered her approaching interview with the celebrated duchesses, and began to fear that she might seem awkward, or provincial, or parvenue; in fact, she lost her self-possession, and heartily repented having wished for a hunt."
"不过，幸好在马车停下的时候，莫黛斯特看到的是一位戴着卷成小卷的金黄色假发的老人。他那安详、丰满、平滑的脸上带着慈父般的微笑和修道士般的快活，半遮半掩的目光显得近乎高贵。这便是罗桑布赖的主人德韦纳伊公爵。公爵夫人是一位极其虔诚的女人，她是一位富有的、已故法院院长的独生女。她身材消瘦、腰板笔直，是四个孩子的母亲，与拉图奈尔夫人颇有几分相似——如果我们能在想象之中将公证人妻子用真正的修道院长般的风度气质修饰一下。","Fortunately, however, as the carriage drew up, Modeste saw an old man, in a blond wig frizzed into little curls, whose calm, plump, smooth face wore a fatherly smile and an expression of monastic cheerfulness which the half-veiled glance of the eye rendered almost noble.This was the Duc de Verneuil, master of Rosembray.The duchess, a woman of extreme piety, the only daughter of a rich and deceased chief-justice, spare and erect, and the mother of four children, resembled Madame Latournelle,—if the imagination can go so far as to adorn the notary’s wife with the graces of a bearing that was truly abbatial."
"“啊，上午好，亲爱的奥尔唐斯！”两个因生性高傲而颇有共鸣的女人一见面，德埃鲁维尔小姐便热情地亲吻了公爵夫人，说道，“让我来向您和亲爱的公爵介绍我们的小天使，德拉巴斯蒂小姐。”","“Ah, good morning, dear Hortense!” said Mademoiselle d’Herouville, kissing the duchess with the sympathy that united their haughty natures; “let me present to you and to the dear duke our little angel, Mademoiselle de La Bastie.”"
"“久仰大名，小姐，”公爵夫人说道，“我们都迫不及待地要接待您了。”","“We have heard so much of you, mademoiselle,” said the duchess, “that we were in haste to receive you.”"
"“今天才认识您，真是遗憾。”德韦纳伊公爵彬彬有礼地赞美道。","“And regret the time lost,” added the Duc de Verneuil, with courteous admiration."
"“这是德拉巴斯蒂伯爵先生。”马厩大总管拉着中校的手臂，将他介绍给公爵和公爵夫人，语气和动作里都带着尊敬的意味。","“Monsieur le Comte de La Bastie,” said the grand equerry, taking the colonel by the arm and presenting him to the duke and duchess, with an air of respect in his tone and gesture."
"“欢迎您，伯爵先生！”德韦纳伊先生说，“您可拥有不少珍宝啊。”他看着莫黛斯特，补充道。","“I am glad to welcome you, Monsieur le comte!” said Monsieur de Verneuil.“You possess more than one treasure,” he added, looking at Modeste."
"公爵夫人挽着莫黛斯特的胳膊，带她走进了一间大客厅，十几个女人正聚在壁炉前。聚会的所有男客都跟公爵呆在平台上，只有卡那利除外，他毕恭毕敬地走到风姿绰约的埃莱奥诺尔身边。德肖利厄公爵夫人坐在绣花绷旁，正在教德韦纳伊小姐怎么给花绣上颜色。","The duchess took Modeste under her arm and led her into an immense salon, where a dozen or more women were grouped about the fireplace.The men of the party remained with the duke on the terrace, except Canalis, who respectfully made his way to the superb Eleonore.The Duchesse de Chaulieu, seated at an embroidery-frame, was showing Mademoiselle de Verneuil how to shade a flower."
"德肖利厄夫人看了莫黛斯特一眼，那目光冰冷、高傲、轻蔑，莫黛斯特就是在弄针插时被针刺穿手指，也不会感觉到比这更尖锐的刺痛。一时间，她眼里只看见了那个女人，而且看穿了她。这些迷人的女人们，我们出于激情，将她们奉若神明，可要想知道她们有多残忍，就必须要看她们彼此的相处了。莫黛斯特脸上情不自禁流露出的那种傻乎乎的崇拜之情，可以消除除埃莱奥诺尔之外任何人对她的戒备。要不是她知道公爵夫人的年龄，她会以为她只有三十六呢。不过，还有其他更让她惊讶的事情等着她呢。","If Modeste had run a needle through her finger when handling a pin-cushion she could not have felt a sharper prick than she received from the cold and haughty and contemptuous stare with which Madame de Chaulieu favored her.For an instant she saw nothing but that one woman, and she saw through her.To understand the depths of cruelty to which these charming creatures, whom our passions deify, can go, we must see women with each other.Modeste would have disarmed almost any other than Eleonore by the perfectly stupid and involuntary admiration which her face betrayed.Had she not known the duchess’s age she would have thought her a woman of thirty-six; but other and greater astonishments awaited her."
"诗人是撞上了一位贵妇人的怒火了。这种怒火就像最凶恶的狮身人面像，脸上是喜气洋洋的，其余部分都是凶神恶煞的。一位情妇表面彬彬有礼、实则冷若冰霜的怒火，在钢铁盔甲的保护下，就连国王本人也奈何不得。卡那利竭力想抓住这钢铁盔甲，但他的手指却在那光滑的表面上打了滑，就像他的话在公爵夫人心上打了滑一样。而公爵夫人优雅的面容、优雅的话语、优雅的风度，隐藏着她盛怒的钢铁，尽管温度已经降到了零下二十五度，所有的观察者却都发现不了。莫黛斯特美得让人叹为观止，穿得跟迪亚娜·德摩弗里纽斯一样漂亮，她的外表已经将埃莱奥诺尔思考时所积累的一连串火药点燃了。","The poet had run plump against a great lady’s anger.Such anger is the worst of sphinxes; the face is radiant, all the rest menacing.Kings themselves cannot make the exquisite politeness of a mistress’s cold anger capitulate when she guards it with steel armor.Canalis tried to cling to the steel, but his fingers slipped on the polished surface, like his words on the heart; and the gracious face, the gracious words, the gracious bearing of the duchess hid the steel of her wrath, now fallen to twenty-five below zero, from all observers.The appearance of Modeste in her sublime beauty, and dressed as well as Diane de Maufrigneuse herself, had fired the train of gunpowder which reflection had been laying in Eleonore’s mind."
"所有的女人都走到了窗户边，看着这个在三位追求者的陪同下从王室马车里走出来的新奇人物。","All the women had gone to the windows to see the new wonder get out of the royal carriage, attended by her three suitors."
"“咱们别显得那么好奇吧。”德肖利厄夫人说。迪亚娜的惊呼在她的心上捅了一刀——“她真是天仙啊！她是从哪里冒出来的？”说完之后，这群女人便回到了她们的座位，恢复了镇定，但埃莱奥诺尔心里充满了饥饿的毒蛇，各个都在叫食。","“Do not let us seem so curious,” Madame de Chaulieu had said, cut to the heart by Diane’s exclamation,—“She is divine! where in the world does she come from?”—and with that the bevy flew back to their seats, resuming their composure, though Eleonore’s heart was full of hungry vipers all clamorous for a meal."
"德埃鲁维尔小姐小声地却意味深长地对德韦纳伊公爵夫人低声说道：“埃莱奥诺尔很不友善地接待了梅尔基奥尔。”","Mademoiselle d’Herouville said in a low voice and with much meaning to the Duchesse de Verneuil, “Eleonore receives her Melchior very ungraciously.”"
"“德摩弗里纽斯公爵夫人觉得他们之间关系冷淡了。”洛尔·德韦纳伊简单地说。","“The Duchesse de Maufrigneuse thinks there is a coolness between them,” said Laure de Verneuil, with simplicity."
"多精彩的说法啊！这在上流社会里经常会用到——北风刮得多么凛冽啊。","Charming phrase! so often used in the world of society,—how the north wind blows through it."
"“为什么会这样？”莫黛斯特问这位刚刚从圣心修道院出来的漂亮小姑娘。","“Why so?” asked Modeste of the pretty young girl who had lately left the Sacre-Coeur."
"“这位伟大的诗人，”虔诚的公爵夫人说道——同时做了个手势，让她女儿不要多嘴——“他离开德肖利厄夫人去了勒阿弗尔，跟她说是健康的原因，之后，半个多月都没给她写过一封信——”","“The great poet,” said the pious duchess—making a sign to her daughter to be silent—“left Madame de Chaulieu without a letter for more than two weeks after he went to Havre, having told her that he went there for his health—”"
"莫黛斯特突然一怔，这引起了洛尔、埃莱娜和德埃鲁维尔小姐的注意。","Modeste made a hasty movement, which caught the attention of Laure, Helene, and Mademoiselle d’Herouville."
"“——而那段时间里，”虔诚的公爵夫人继续说道，“她还在想方设法让他被任命为荣誉军团指挥官和驻巴登大使。”","“—and during that time,” continued the devout duchess, “she was endeavoring to have him appointed commander of the Legion of honor, and minister at Baden.”"
"“哎，卡那利太可耻了，他所有的东西都是公爵夫人给的。”德埃鲁维尔小姐大声说道。","“Oh, that was shameful in Canalis; he owes everything to her,” exclaimed Mademoiselle d’Herouville."
"“德肖利厄夫人为什么没来勒阿弗尔呢？”莫黛斯特天真地问埃莱娜。","“Why did not Madame de Chaulieu come to Havre?” asked Modeste of Helene, innocently."
"“亲爱的，”德韦纳伊公爵夫人说，“她就是被人粉身碎骨，也不会说一句话的。你看她——一副女王的架势，她的头就算被砍掉，也还会像玛丽·斯图亚特那样微笑的，事实上，她的血脉中就有一些王室的成分。”","“My dear,” said the Duchesse de Verneuil, “she would let herself be cut in little pieces without saying a word.Look at her,—she is regal; her head would smile, like Mary Stuart’s, after it was cut off; in fact, she has some of that blood in her veins.”"
"“她也没给他写信吗？”莫黛斯特问道。","“Did she not write to him?” asked Modeste."
"“迪亚娜告诉我，”公爵夫人被德埃鲁维尔小姐用手肘捅了一下，受到了鼓动，便回答说，“她前些天，给了卡那利的第一封信一个刻薄的回复。”","“Diane tells me,” answered the duchess, prompted by a nudge from Mademoiselle d’Herouville, “that in answer to Canalis’s first letter she made a cutting reply a few days ago.”"
"这番解释让莫黛斯特为她眼前的这个男人感到羞愧，脸红了起来。她渴望的倒不是将他在脚下踩得粉碎，而是用一种比匕首的刺杀还要狠毒的恶意行为来报复他。她高傲地看着德肖利厄公爵夫人——","This explanation made Modeste blush with shame for the man before her; she longed, not to crush him under her feet, but to revenge herself by one of those malicious acts that are sharper than a dagger’s thrust.She looked haughtily at the Duchesse de Chaulieu—"
"“梅尔基奥尔先生！”她说。","“Monsieur Melchior!” she said."
"所有的女人都屏住呼吸，轮流看着公爵夫人。公爵夫人正在绣花绷旁同卡那利低声说话，而此时，这位没有教养的少女竟然打断了一对恋人的私会——这种想法在任何社交场合都是不被允许的。然而，迪亚娜·德摩弗里纽斯却点点头，好像是要说：“这个孩子有权这么做。”最后，所有的女人都朝彼此微笑起来，她们都不满一位五十六岁的女人还能那么漂亮，能够把手指伸进宝库中偷取本该属于年轻人的财富。梅尔基奥尔焦灼不安地看着莫黛斯特，做了一个主人对贴身男仆做的手势，而公爵夫人则像一头正在吃食的母狮子受到打扰一样，低下了头。她的眼睛盯着十字布，朝诗人放射出深红的火焰，像讽刺短诗一样具有杀伤力，因为这诗的字字句句都是对她加倍的侮辱。","All the women snuffed the air and looked alternately at the duchess, who was talking in an undertone to Canalis over the embroidery-frame, and then at the young girl so ill brought up as to disturb a lovers’ meeting,—a think not permissible in any society.Diane de Maufrigneuse nodded, however, as much as to say, “The child is in the right of it.”All the women ended by smiling at each other; they were enraged with a woman who was fifty-six years old and still handsome enough to put her fingers into the treasury and steal the dues of youth.Melchior looked at Modeste with feverish impatience, and made the gesture of a master to a valet, while the duchess lowered her head with the movement of a lioness disturbed at a meal; her eyes, fastened on the canvas, emitted red flames in the direction of the poet, which stabbed like epigrams, for each word revealed to her a triple insult."
"“梅尔基奥尔先生！”莫黛斯特又喊了一句，声音听起来理直气壮。","“Monsieur Melchior!” said Modeste again in a voice that asserted its right to be heard."
"“什么事，小姐？”诗人问道。","“What, mademoiselle?” demanded the poet."
"他不得不站起来，一边是绣花绷，靠近窗户，而另一边是壁炉，莫黛斯特和德韦纳伊公爵夫人坐在沙发上。他站在绣花绷和壁炉中间，一动不动。这个野心勃勃的家伙瞥了埃莱奥诺尔一眼，痛苦的念头顿时涌上心头。要是听从了莫黛斯特的使唤，他跟他的保护人之间的一切就结束了，而且是永远结束。要是不听她的使唤，就等于公开声明他的仆人身份，也就要错过他二十五天来那些卑鄙勾当所换来的时机，而且有违最简单的礼节和客套。事情越是愚蠢，公爵夫人越是急切地催促着他去干。莫黛斯特的美貌和财富同埃莱奥诺尔的权势和影响力相互抗争，使得卡那利在人性和荣誉之间犹豫不决，这就跟斗牛士在竞技场上面临的危险一样可怕。卡那利心跳不止，简直要得动脉瘤了。一个人也许只有在赌桌前，眼看就要决定自己是发财还是破产时，才会有这种感觉。","Forced to rise, he remained standing half-way between the embroidery frame, which was near a window, and the fireplace where Modeste was seated with the Duchesse de Verneuil on a sofa.What bitter reflections came into his ambitious mind, as he caught a glance from Eleonore.If he obeyed Modeste all was over, and forever, between himself and his protectress.Not to obey her was to avow his slavery, to lose the chances of his twenty-five days of base manoeuvring, and to disregard the plainest laws of decency and civility.The greater the folly, the more imperatively the duchess exacted it.Modeste’s beauty and money thus pitted against Eleonore’s rights and influence made this hesitation between the man and his honor as terrible to witness as the peril of a matador in the arena.A man seldom feels such palpitations as those which now came near causing Canalis an aneurism, except, perhaps, before the green table, where his fortune or his ruin is about to be decided."
"“德埃鲁维尔小姐刚刚催促我下车，我把手绢落下了——”莫黛斯特对卡那利说。","“Mademoiselle d’Herouville hurried me from the carriage, and I left behind me,” said Modeste to Canalis, “my handkerchief—”"
"卡那利别有用心地耸了耸肩。","Canalis shrugged his shoulders significantly."
"“而且，”莫黛斯特没有理会他的动作，继续说道，“手绢里裹着一张书桌的钥匙，那书桌里有一封重要信件的片段。请帮个忙，梅尔基奥尔先生，帮我去取下手绢。”","“And,” continued Modeste, taking no notice of his gesture, “I had tied into one corner of it the key of a desk which contains the fragment of an important letter; have the kindness, Monsieur Melchior, to get it for me.”"
"卡那利夹在都已发怒的天使和猛虎之间，脸色发青，没有再犹豫——两者之中，猛虎对他来说似乎危险性小些。就在他准备破釜沉舟，按莫黛斯特的要求去做时，拉布里埃出现在客厅门口，这对他极度痛苦的头脑来说，就像是加百利大天使从天而降。","Between an angel and a tiger equally enraged Canalis, who had turned livid, no longer hesitated,—the tiger seemed to him the least dangerous of the two; and he was about to do as he was told, and commit himself irretrievably, when La Briere appeared at the door of the salon, seeming to his anguished mind like the archangel Gabriel tumbling from heaven."
"“喂，埃内斯特，德拉巴斯蒂小姐叫你呢。”诗人说道，赶快回到绣花绷旁边自己的椅子上去了。","“Ernest, here, Mademoiselle de La Bastie wants you,” said the poet, hastily returning to his chair by the embroidery frame."
"埃内斯特没跟任何人施礼，匆忙跑到了莫黛斯特那里。他的眼里只有她，他带着无法掩饰的欢心领了任务，从客厅里飞奔出去，每一位在场的女士都默默地赞许他。","Ernest rushed to Modeste without bowing to any one; he saw only her, took his commission with undisguised joy, and darted from the room, with the secret approbation of every woman present."
"“诗人也做这个！”莫黛斯特一边对埃莱娜·德埃鲁维尔说道，一边朝公爵夫人呆的绣花绷望去。公爵夫人正在那里气冲冲地做着刺绣。","“What an occupation for a poet!” said Modeste to Helene d’Herouville, glancing toward the embroidery at which the duchess was now working savagely."
"“你要是跟她讲话，你要是看她一眼，我们就一刀两断，”公爵夫人低声对诗人说道，埃内斯特的到来给这一幕带来的可疑结局令她很是不满，“记住，就是我不在这儿，我也会留下耳目看着你的。”","“If you speak to her, if you ever look at her, all is over between us,” said the duchess to the poet in a low voice, not at all satisfied with the very doubtful termination which Ernest’s arrival had put to the scene; “and remember, if I am not present, I leave behind me eyes that will watch you.”"
"说完这句话，公爵夫人便优雅地迈开她那鹿脚般纤细矫健的小脚，站了起来，朝迪亚娜·德摩弗里纽斯的周围的人群走去。公爵夫人身材中等，像所有年过五十却仍然美丽动人的女人一样，身材有点发胖。在她丰满的体态下，可以看出极度的灵巧。这类女人的灵巧，正是由于她们神经系统的活力控制着肌肉的运动，并赋予其生命力。没有其他原因能解释她那轻盈的步伐和举手投足间无与伦比的高贵。只有祖上从挪亚时代起便是贵族的妇女，才能像埃莱奥诺尔这样，尽管日渐发胖，却还是知道怎样摆出庄重威严的样子。她着一身晨装，雍容典雅有如王后，怡然自得有如少女，一位哲学家在称赞她上身的优美曲线和细心打扮的同时，恐怕要可怜菲罗塞娜了。她一头浓密的、没有染色的秀发，简简单单编成辫子盘在了头上。她骄傲地露出雪白的脖颈、线条精致的双肩，以及久负盛名的双手和手臂，这份骄傲倒也情有可原。莫黛斯特同公爵夫人的其他所有对手一样，都不得不承认她是那种“让我们黯然失色”的女人。事实上，埃莱奥诺尔是如今已寥寥无几的贵妇人之一。她头部的仪态多么威严有气势，她颈部的曲线多么精致优美，她的动作多么协调，举止多么高贵，每一个细节与整体之间配合得多么完美，呈现出多么惊人的艺术美——艺术就像她的第二天性，让她变得崇高，甚至神圣——要试图解释这一切，就好比要分析那些至高无上的东西一样困难。人们像享受帕格尼尼的诗意一样，享受着她的诗意。他们不去自问要通过什么来享受，他们知道原因存在于不可见的心灵之中。","So saying, the duchess, a woman of medium height, but a little too stout, like all women over fifty who retain their beauty, rose and walked toward the group which surrounded Diane de Maufrigneuse, stepping daintily on little feet that were as slender and nervous as a deer’s.Beneath her plumpness could be seen the exquisite delicacy of such women, which comes from the vigor of their nervous systems controlling and vitalizing the development of flesh.There is no other way to explain the lightness of her step, and the incomparable nobility of her bearing.None but the women whose quarterings begin with Noah know, as Eleonore did, how to be majestic in spite of a buxom tendency.A philosopher might have pitied Philoxene, while admiring the graceful lines of the bust and the minute care bestowed upon a morning dress, which was worn with the elegance of a queen and the easy grace of a young girl.Her abundant hair, still undyed, was simply wound about her head in plaits; she bared her snowy throat and shoulders, exquisitely modelled, and her celebrated hand and arm, with pardonable pride.Modeste, together with all other antagonists of the duchess, recognized in her a woman of whom they were forced to say, “She eclipses us.”In fact, Eleonore was one of the “grandes dames” now so rare.To endeavor to explain what august quality there was in the carriage of the head, what refinement and delicacy in the curve of the throat, what harmony in her movements, and nobility in her bearing, what grandeur in the perfect accord of details with the whole being, and in the arts, now a second nature, which render a woman grand and even sacred,—to explain all these things would simply be to attempt to analyze the sublime.People enjoy such poetry as they enjoy that of Paganini; they do not explain to themselves the medium, they know the cause is in the spirit that remains invisible."
"德肖利厄夫人低头向埃莱娜和她的姑姑施礼，然后，她用平静的语气对迪亚娜说道：“公爵夫人，更衣的时间到了吧？”说完便在她的儿媳和德埃鲁维尔小姐的陪同下走了出去。走出客厅时，她低声跟老姑娘说这话。老姑娘压了压她的胳膊，说：“你真是个可人儿，”——其实意思是，“我万分感谢你刚才给我们帮的忙。”之后，德埃鲁维尔小姐便回到客厅去扮演她的间谍角色了。她的第一个眼神就告诉卡那利，公爵夫人刚刚可不是做样子吓唬人的。这位初出茅庐的外交官明白了，他的伎俩还不足以进行这样的斗争，而他的才智让他选择了一种即使不是更加光彩、至少也是更加老实的姿态。埃内斯特带着莫黛斯特的手帕回来时，诗人抓住他的手臂，把他带到了平台上。","Madame de Chaulieu bowed her head in salutation of Helene and her aunt; then, saying to Diane, in a pure and equable tone of voice, without a trace of emotion, “Is it not time to dress, duchess?” she made her exit, accompanied by her daughter-in-law and Mademoiselle d’Herouville.As she left the room she spoke in an undertone to the old maid, who pressed her arm, saying, “You are charming,”—which meant, “I am all gratitude for the service you have just done us.”After that, Mademoiselle d’Herouville returned to the salon to play her part of spy, and her first glance apprised Canalis that the duchess had made him no empty threat.That apprentice in diplomacy became aware that his science was not sufficient for a struggle of this kind, and his wit served him to take a more honest position, if not a worthier one.When Ernest returned, bringing Modeste’s handkerchief, the poet seized his arm and took him out on the terrace."
"“我亲爱的朋友，”他说，“我不仅是世界上最不幸的人，还是最滑稽的人。我来找你，是求你把我从我自己捅的马蜂窝里解救出来。莫黛斯特是个恶魔，她看到了我的窘境，还嘲笑我。她刚刚跟我说到德肖利厄夫人写的信的片段，我当时真是愚蠢，竟把它给了她。要是她把那段信拿出来，我就永远也不能和埃莱奥诺尔和好了。所以，你能不能马上去让莫黛斯特把那张纸还给我，并告诉她，我对她没有任何企图？说我仰赖她作为一个少女的体贴和礼貌，让她把我当陌生人对待吧。我请求她不要跟我说话，恳求她对我冷淡些——当然，我不太敢要求她装出满腔妒火的样子，尽管那样将对我的切身利益大有帮助。去吧，我在这等你的回复。”","“My dear friend,” he said, “I am not only the most unfortunate man in the world, but I am also the most ridiculous; and I come to you to get me out of the hornet’s nest into which I have run myself.Modeste is a demon; she sees my difficulty and she laughs at it; she has just spoken to me of a fragment of a letter of Madame de Chaulieu, which I had the folly to give her; if she shows it I can never make my peace with Eleonore.Therefore, will you at once ask Modeste to send me back that paper, and tell her, from me, that I make no pretensions to her hand.Say I count upon her delicacy, upon her propriety as a young girl, to behave to me as if we had never known each other.I beg her not to speak to me; I implore her to treat me harshly,—though I hardly dare ask her to feign a jealous anger, which would help my interests amazingly.Go, I will wait here for an answer.”"
"第二十八章 彰显尊贵","Chapter XXVIII Modeste Behaves with Dignity"
"拉布里埃再次回到客厅时，看到一位年轻的勒阿弗尔近卫军长官德赛里齐子爵，他刚刚从罗斯尼城堡过来，宣布说夫人要参加议会立宪开幕式。大家都知道这次隆重的立宪会议在当时有多重要，查理十世要在王室成员的拥簇下发表演说——太子妃和夫人都要坐在旁听席上。挑选这个军官作为使者来传达王妃的惋惜之情，就是对迪亚娜的关切。迪亚娜当时正是这位俊美的年轻人的爱恋对象，他是一位国家大臣的儿子，一名普通的内阁侍从，但他是独生子，会继承一大笔财产。德摩弗里纽斯公爵夫人接受了他的殷勤，目的无非是让人们注意他母亲德赛里齐夫人的年龄。据那些扇子背后的窃窃私语称，德赛里齐夫人曾从德摩弗里纽斯公爵夫人那夺走了俊美的吕西安·德吕邦泼雷的心。","On re-entering the salon Ernest de La Briere found a young officer of the company of the guard d’Havre, the Vicomte de Serizy, who had just arrived from Rosny to announce that Madame was obliged to be present at the opening of the Chambers.We know the importance then attached to this constitutional solemnity, at which Charles X. delivered his speech, surrounded by the royal family,—Madame la Dauphine and Madame being present in their gallery.The choice of the emissary charged with the duty of expressing the princess’s regrets was an attention to Diane, who was then an object of adoration to this charming young man, son of a minister of state, gentleman in ordinary of the chamber, only son and heir to an immense fortune.The Duchesse de Maufrigneuse permitted his attentions solely for the purpose of attracting notice to the age of his mother, Madame de Serizy, who was said, in those chronicles that are whispered behind the fans, to have deprived her of the heart of the handsome Lucien de Rubempre."
"“我希望您能赏脸留在罗桑布赖。”严肃的公爵夫人对这位年轻的军官说道。","“You will do us the pleasure, I hope, to remain at Rosembray,” said the severe duchess to the young officer."
"这位虔诚的夫人，她一边听着每一句流言蜚语，一边对公爵为她精心挑选的客人的那些轻浮行为视而不见。的确，这些杰出的女性，以将迷途羔羊带回羊圈为借口，要宽宏大量地忍受多少事情，真是令人称奇。","While giving ear to every scandal, the devout lady shut her eyes to the derelictions of her guests who had been carefully selected by the duke; indeed, it is surprising how much these excellent women will tolerate under pretence of bringing the lost sheep back to the fold by their indulgence."
"“我们没有考虑到我们的立宪政府，”马厩大总管说道，“公爵夫人，罗桑布赖要大失光彩了。”","“We reckoned without our constitutional government,” said the grand equerry; “and Rosembray, Madame la duchesse, will lose a great honor.”"
"“这样我们会更自在些。”一位高高瘦瘦的老者说，他七十五岁上下，穿一件蓝色衣服，并得到了女士们的允许，戴着一顶狩猎帽。这位酷似德波旁公爵的老者，不是别人，正是猎队队长德卡迪央亲王，是法国最后的大贵族之一。就在拉布里埃试图溜到沙发后面跟莫黛斯特交谈一会儿时，一位三十八岁、矮矮胖胖、长相十分普通的男人来到了客厅里。","“We shall be more at our ease,” said a tall thin old man, about seventy-five years of age, dressed in blue cloth, and wearing his hunting-cap by permission of the ladies.This personage, who closely resembled the Duc de Bourbon, was no less than the Prince de Cadignan, Master of the Hunt, and one of the last of the great French lords.Just as La Briere was endeavoring to slip behind the sofa and obtain a moment’s intercourse with Modeste, a man of thirty-eight, short, fat, and very common in appearance, entered the room."
"“这是我儿子，德卢东亲王。”德韦纳伊公爵夫人对莫黛斯特说道。昔日旺代省的英雄因他的勇敢和殉难使这个姓氏名扬天下，可看到继承这一历史姓氏的人，莫黛斯特那年轻的脸庞上不禁露出了惊讶的神情。","“My son, the Prince de Loudon,” said the Duchesse de Verneuil to Modeste, who could not restrain the expression of amazement that overspread her young face on seeing the man who bore the historical name that the hero of La Vendee had rendered famous by his bravery and the martyrdom of his death."
"“加斯帕尔。”公爵夫人将儿子叫到身边。这位年轻的亲王马上就过来了，他的母亲便指着莫黛斯特接着说道：“这是德拉巴斯蒂小姐，我的朋友。”","“Gaspard,” said the duchess, calling her son to her.The young prince came at once, and his mother continued, motioning to Modeste, “Mademoiselle de La Bastie, my friend.”"
"这位假定继承人，他同德普兰的独生女的婚事最近刚定下来。他向莫黛斯特鞠躬施礼，却没有像他父亲那样，被她的美貌所震惊。这样以来，莫黛斯特便能将如今的年轻一代同往日的老一代进行比较了。德卡迪央老亲王说过的几句话已经让她感觉到他对女性和王族有着同样真诚的敬意。德肖利厄公爵夫人的长子是德肖利厄公爵，他最引人注意的特点当属同样粗鲁无礼、无拘无束、懒懒散散的行为态度，他傲慢地向莫黛斯特鞠躬施礼。这种父辈与子辈之间的鲜明对比，原因也许就在于年轻人不再感觉像他们的父辈那样感觉自己是伟大人物，他们十分清楚自己现在只不过是伟大人物的投影，因此便摒弃了伟大人物的义务。父辈们还保持着从前显赫时期骨子里的那种文雅礼貌，就像整个山谷已迎来黄昏时，山顶仍镀着一层金光，熠熠生辉。","The heir presumptive, whose marriage with Desplein’s only daughter had lately been arranged, bowed to the young girl without seeming struck, as his father had been, with her beauty.Modeste was thus enabled to compare the youth of today with the old age of a past epoch; for the old Prince de Cadignan had already said a few words which made her feel that he rendered as true a homage to womanhood as to royalty.The Duc de Rhetore, the eldest son of the Duchesse de Chaulieu, chiefly remarkable for manners that were equally impertinent and free and easy, bowed to Modeste rather cavalierly.The reason of this contrast between the fathers and the sons is to be found, probably, in the fact that young men no longer feel themselves great beings, as their forefathers did, and they dispense with the duties of greatness, knowing well that they are now but the shadow of it.The fathers retain the inherent politeness of their vanished grandeur, like the mountain-tops still gilded by the sun when all is twilight in the valley."
"最后，埃内斯特总算是能对莫黛斯特悄悄说了句话，她便马上站了起来。","Ernest was at last able to slip a word into Modeste’s ear, and she rose immediately."
"“我亲爱的，”公爵夫人以为她要去更衣，便拉了铃，说道，“有人会带你去你的住处。”","“My dear,” said the duchesse, thinking she was going to dress, and pulling a bell-rope, “they shall show you your apartment.”"
"埃内斯特一边陪着莫黛斯特走到大楼梯下，一边跟她讲述那个倒霉诗人的请求，并试图通过描述梅尔基奥尔的极度痛苦来打动她。","Ernest accompanied Modeste to the foot of the grand staircase, presenting the request of the luckless poet, and endeavoring to touch her feelings by describing Melchior’s agony."
"“您看，他是爱您的——他是一个自认为能够挣脱枷锁的俘虏。”","“You see, he loves—he is a captive who thought he could break his chain.”"
"“这样一个急功近利的人也配有爱情！”莫黛斯特反驳道。","“Love in such a rapid seeker after fortune!” retorted Modeste."
"“小姐，您才刚刚步入生活，您还不知道它的肮脏。一个被比自己大很多的女人控制的男人，他的反复无常是应该得到谅解的，因为这真的不是他的责任。想想看，卡那利为她作出了多少牺牲。他种下了太多那样的种子，想不收获都不行，公爵夫人对他来讲，代表着十年的忠诚和幸福。您让他忘记了所有这一切，而不幸的是，他的虚荣心要比自尊心强，他直到今天在这里见到了肖利厄夫人，才开始反思他正在失去的东西。如果您真的了解他，就应该帮帮他。他是个孩子，总把自己的生活搞得一团糟。您说他是个急功近利之人，但他的追求非常盲目。跟所有的诗人一样，他是感觉的牺牲者。他很孩子气，像个小孩子一样，很容易被那些闪闪发亮的东西弄得眼花缭乱，追逐它们的光亮。他曾经爱过马匹和绘画，并渴望名声——唉，后来他又将他的藏画卖掉，去买甲胄以及文艺复兴和路易十五时期的旧家具。而现在，他又在追求政治权势。您也承认他的爱好都是比较高雅的吧。”","“Mademoiselle, you are at the entrance of life; you do not know its defiles.The inconsistencies of a man who falls under the dominion of a woman much older than himself should be forgiven, for he is really not accountable.Think how many sacrifices Canalis has made to her.He has sown too much seed of that kind to resign the harvest; the duchess represents to him ten years of devotion and happiness.You made him forget all that, and unfortunately, he has more vanity than pride; he did not reflect on what he was losing until he met Madame Chaulieu here today.If you really understood him, you would help him.He is a child, always mismanaging his life.You call him a seeker after fortune, but he seeks very badly; like all poets, he is a victim of sensations; he is childish, easily dazzled like a child by anything that shines, and pursuing its glitter.He used to love horses and pictures, and he craved fame,—well, he sold his pictures to buy armor and old furniture of the Renaissance and Louis XV.; just now he is seeking political power.Admit that his hobbies are noble things.”"
"“够了够了，”莫黛斯特答道，“过来，”她看到她的父亲，便点头示意他过来挽着自己的胳膊，并接着说道，“跟我来，我把那张信纸给您，您可以把它给那位伟人，并让他放心，我会迁就他的意愿，但有一个条件——您必须替我谢谢他，我很高兴看他为我上演了一出最好的德国戏剧。这让我明白了歌德的杰作既不是《浮士德》，也不是《哀格蒙特》——”然后，就在埃内斯特疑惑不解地看着这个居心不良的姑娘时，她补充道，“而是《托夸托·塔索》！请告诉卡那利先生，让他把它重读一遍，”她笑着补充说，“我特别要求您一字不漏地将我所说的重复给您的朋友听，因为我的话并不是什么讽刺短诗，而是对他行为的辩护——这两者之间的细微差别就在于，我相信由于他的埃莱奥诺尔的愚蠢行为，他会变得越来越理性的。”","“You have said enough,” replied Modeste; “come,” she added, seeing her father, whom she called with a motion of her head to give her his arm; “come with me, and I will give you that scrap of paper; you shall carry it to the great man and assure him of my condescension to his wishes, but on one condition,—you must thank him in my name for the pleasure I have taken in seeing one of the finest of the German plays performed in my honor.I have learned that Goethe’s masterpiece is neither Faust nor Egmont—” and then, as Ernest looked at the malicious girl with a puzzled air, she added: “It is Torquato Tasso!Tell Monsieur de Canalis to re-read it,” she added smiling; “I particularly desire that you will repeat to your friend word for word what I say; for it is not an epigram, it is the justification of his conduct,—with this trifling difference, that he will, I trust, become more and more reasonable, thanks to the folly of his Eleonore.”"
"公爵夫人的头号女仆将莫黛斯特和她的父亲领到他们的住处，弗朗索瓦丝·科歇已经把一切都安排妥当了，而住处的高级、典雅让中校惊讶不已，特别是当他听弗朗索瓦丝说城堡里还有三十套同样格调的住房。","The duchess’s head-woman conducted Modeste and her father to their apartment, where Francoise Cochet had already put everything in order, and the choice elegance of which astounded the colonel, more especially after he heard from Francoise that there were thirty other apartments in the chateau decorated with the same taste."
"“这就是我眼中真正意义上的乡村住宅。”莫黛斯特说。","“This is what I call a proper country-house,” said Modeste."
"“德拉巴斯蒂伯爵一定会为你建一座这样的城堡。”她的父亲回答道。","“The Comte de La Bastie must build you one like it,” replied her father."
"“给您，先生，”莫黛斯特把那张信纸给了埃内斯特，说道，“把它给咱们的朋友吧，让他从痛苦中解脱出来。”","“Here, monsieur,” said Modeste, giving the bit of paper to Ernest; “carry it to our friend and put him out of his misery.”"
"“咱们的朋友”这个词让这位年轻人心里一震。他注视着莫黛斯特，想看看她表面承认的共同兴趣是不是真的，而她也完全明白他的眼神是什么意思，便补充说：“好了，赶快去吧，您的朋友还在等着呢。”","The word our friend struck the young man’s heart.He looked at Modeste to see if there was anything real in the community of interests which she seemed to admit, and she, understanding perfectly what his look meant, added, “Come, go at once, your friend is waiting.”"
"拉布里埃满脸通红，离开了房间，他心中的疑惑和不安比绝望还要难以忍受。对于真正的恋人来说，通往幸福的道路就像是天主教诗歌中所谓的天堂入口处那条狭窄的道路——它代表的是一条黑暗、压抑的通道，回响着对人间疾苦的最后呐喊。","La Briere colored excessively, and left the room in a state of doubt and anxiety less endurable than despair.The path that approaches happiness is, to the true lover, like the narrow way which Catholic poetry has called the entrance to Paradise,—expressing thus a dark and gloomy passage, echoing with the last cries of earthly anguish."
"一个小时后，光彩夺目的这一行人齐聚在客厅里，有的在玩惠斯特牌，还有的在聊天，女人们手里做着刺绣，所有的人都在等待晚宴的开始。德卡迪央亲王让米尼翁先生讲讲中国和他在帝国参加过的战役，还让他谈谈波唐杜埃、莱斯托拉德，以及莫孔伯等普罗旺斯的家族。他埋怨米尼翁先生没有谋个什么职位，而且他保证说，要恢复他近卫军中校的头衔是再容易不过的事情。","An hour later this illustrious company were all assembled in the salon; some were playing whist, others conversing; the women had their embroideries in hand, and all were waiting the announcement of dinner.The Prince de Cadignan was drawing Monsieur Mignon out upon China, and his campaigns under the empire, and making him talk about the Portendueres, the L’Estorades, and the Maucombes, Provencal families; he blamed him for not seeking service, and assured him that nothing would be easier than to restore him to his rank as colonel of the Guard."
"“拥有您这样的出身和财富的人，不应该属于当今的反对派的。”亲王笑着说。","“A man of your birth and your fortune ought not to belong to the present Opposition,” said the prince, smiling."
"这群英荟萃的上流社会不仅让莫黛斯特高兴不已，还让她在逗留期间养成了一套完美无缺的行为举止，如果没有这次机会，她可能一辈子也学不到这些。给一位还在学徒期的技师看一座钟，把整个机械系统展示给他看，这样，他自身潜在的才能的芽孢便会萌发。同样，莫黛斯特的天性让她学会了德摩弗里纽斯夫人和德肖利厄夫人的独特品质。对她来说，看着这些女人，就像是受教育，而一个市井女子如果笨拙模仿的话，只会成为众人的笑柄，贻笑大方。像莫黛斯特这样出身高贵、受过良好教育，而且思想端正的年轻女子，很自然地就跟这些人玩熟了，而且马上就看出了贵族社会与中产阶级社会、外省与圣日耳曼地区的区别所在，她把那些几乎是难以捉摸的细微差别都抓住了。简言之，她看出了这些贵妇人的风度所在，并坚信自己也能拥有那种风度。她还发现，在这座群英荟萃的奥林匹斯山上，她父亲和拉布里埃的表现要比卡那利好得多。这位伟大的诗人，放弃了自己真正的无可置疑的才智、即思想的才智后，就变成变成了区区一个图谋一官半职的马屁精，他想用阴谋诡计获取一枚勋章，还被迫取悦整个贵族社会。埃内斯特·德拉布里埃没有那些野心，因而能够保持本色，而梅尔基奥尔，用一个低俗一点的词来形容，如今已成了一个小伙计，竭力讨好德卢东亲王、德雷托雷公爵、德赛里齐子爵和德摩弗里纽斯公爵，不像米尼翁中校那样能够坚持自己的意见。中校因参加过多次战役、又被拿破仑帝王所信任而倍感自豪，这也合情合理。莫黛斯特注意到，这个有着真实才华的人竭尽所能地寻找一些可以逗大家一笑的俏皮话，发表一段精妙的演说，或说点恭维话，出于自己的私利去讨好那些大人物。一言以蔽之，在莫黛斯特眼里，他就是一只拔光了尾羽的孔雀。","This society of distinguished persons not only pleased Modeste, but it enabled her to acquire, during her stay, a perfection of manners which without this revelation she would have lacked all her life.Show a clock to an embryo mechanic, and you reveal to him the whole mechanism; he thus develops the germs of his faculty which lie dormant within him.In like manner Modeste had the instinct to appropriate the distinctive qualities of Madame de Maufrigneuse and Madame de Chaulieu.For her, the sight of these women was an education; whereas a bourgeois would merely have ridiculed their ways or made them absurd by clumsy imitation.A well-born, well-educated, and right-minded young woman like Modeste fell naturally into connection with these people, and saw at once the differences that separate the aristocratic world from the bourgeois world, the provinces from the faubourg Saint-Germain; she caught the almost imperceptible shadings; in short, she perceived the grace of the “grande dame” without doubting that she could herself acquire it.She noticed also that her father and La Briere appeared infinitely better in this Olympus than Canalis.The great poet, abdicating his real and incontestable power, that of the mind, became nothing more than a courtier seeking a ministry, intriguing for an order, and forced to please the whole galaxy.Ernest de La Briere, without ambitions, was able to be himself; while Melchior became, to use a vulgar expression, a mere toady, and courted the Prince de Loudon, the Duc de Rhetore, the Vicomte de Serizy, or the Duc de Maufrigneuse, like a man not free to assert himself, as did Colonel Mignon, who was justly proud of his campaigns, and of the confidence of the Emperor Napoleon.Modeste took note of the strained efforts of the man of real talent, seeking some witticism that should raise a laugh, some clever speech, some compliment with which to flatter these grand personages, whom it was his interest to please.In a word, to Modeste’s eyes the peacock plucked out his tail-feathers."
"到了晚上，少女同马厩大总管坐到了客厅的一角。她把他带到那里，目的是要结束他的追求，要是她想保持自己的自尊，就不能再鼓励他的追求了。","Toward the middle of the evening the young girl sat down with the grand equerry in a corner of the salon.She led him there purposely to end a suit which she could no longer encourage if she wished to retain her self-respect."
"“公爵先生，如果您真的了解我，”她说，“您就会明白，您的关怀给了我多深的触动。正是出于我对您人格的极大尊重，以及您这样的高贵人儿在我内心激起的那份友情，我不能继续伤害您的自尊心了。在您到达勒阿弗尔之前，我就真诚地、深深地，而且矢志不移地爱着一个人，一个值得被爱的人，我对他的感情还是个秘密，但我希望让您知道——说这些话，我要比大多数少女都更真诚——要不是我已经有了这种心甘情愿的依恋，我会选择您的，因为我在您身上发现了高贵且美好的品质。您姑姑和姐姐跟我说了一些您的打算，这促使我做了这次坦白的声明。如果您愿意，明天上午围猎开始之前我母亲就会来信，借口说她生病了，将我召回她身边。没有您的同意，我是不会参加您好心为我准备的这次盛会的，而且，要是我的秘密在盛会上泄露出来，那您会感觉受到了打击和欺骗。您会问我究竟为什么要来这里。但我无法拒绝这次邀请。请您宽宏大量，不要因为一种几乎是必须的好奇心而责备我。但这不是最重要的，不是我要对您说的最难表达的话。我和我的父亲都是您坚定的朋友——也许比您想象得还要坚定。至于让您来找我的第一个原因是我的财产，我想说的是——不过我不是想把这个当作止痛膏，来宽慰您出于礼貌将要表达出来的悲伤——我的父亲已经仔细考虑过沼泽地的事情，他的朋友迪迈觉得您的计划可行，而且他们已经开始组建一家公司。哥本海姆、迪迈和我的父亲已经筹集了一千五百万法郎，并着手从有兴趣接手这个业务的富商们那筹集其余的资金。虽然我没能有幸成为德埃鲁维尔公爵夫人的荣幸，但我却很有把握，让您不受任何束缚地在比我更高的一个阶层中挑选到她。唉！请让我把话说完。”她看到公爵做了个手势，便大声说道。","“Monsieur le duc, if you really knew me,” she said, “you would understand how deeply I am touched by your attentions.It is because of the profound respect I feel for your character, and the friendship which a soul like yours inspires in mine, that I cannot endure to wound your self-love.Before your arrival in Havre I loved sincerely, deeply, and forever, one who is worthy of being loved, and my affection for whom is still a secret; but I wish you to know—and in saying this I am more sincere than most young girls—that had I not already formed this voluntary attachment, you would have been my choice, for I recognize your noble and beautiful qualities.A few words which your aunt and sister have said to me as to your intentions lead me to make this frank avowal.If you think it desirable, a letter from my mother shall recall me, on pretence of her illness, tomorrow morning before the hunt begins.Without your consent I do not choose to be present at a fete which I owe to your kindness, and where, if my secret should escape me, you might feel hurt and defrauded.You will ask me why I have come here at all.I could not withstand the invitation.Be generous enough not to reproach me for what was almost a necessary curiosity.But this is not the chief, not the most delicate thing I have to say to you.You have firm friends in my father and myself,—more so than perhaps you realize; and as my fortune was the first cause that brought you to me, I wish to say—but without intending to use it as a sedative to calm the grief which gallantry requires you to testify—that my father has thought over the affair of the marshes, his friend Dumay thinks your project feasible, and they have already taken steps to form a company.Gobenheim, Dumay, and my father have subscribed fifteen hundred thousand francs, and undertake to get the rest from capitalists, who will feel it in their interest to take up the matter.If I have not the honor of becoming the Duchesse d’Herouville, I have almost the certainty of enabling you to choose her, free from all trammels in your choice, and in a higher sphere than mine.Oh! let me finish,” she cried, at a gesture from the duke."
"“从我侄子的情绪来判断，”德埃鲁维尔小姐对她的侄女低声说道，“很容易就看得出你有弟媳妇了。”","“Judging by my nephew’s emotion,” whispered Mademoiselle d’Herouville to her niece, “it is easy to see you have a sister.”"
"“公爵先生，从我们第一天一起骑马、听到您悲叹自己的处境时，我就决定了这一切。这就是我想对您说的。那一天决定了我的未来。虽然您没有征服一个女人，但您至少在安古维尔得到了一群忠实的朋友——如果您愿意屈尊把我们当成朋友。”","“Monsieur le duc, all this was settled in my mind the day of our first ride, when I heard you deplore your situation.This is what I have wished to say to you.That day determined my future life.Though you did not make the conquest of a woman, you have at least gained faithful friends at Ingouville—if you will deign to accord us that title.”"
"这一席简短的谈话，莫黛斯特已经反复斟酌过，它以如此动人的肺腑之言道出，马厩大总管听得热泪盈眶。他抓住她的手，亲吻了一下。","This little discourse, which Modeste had carefully thought over, was said with so much charm of soul that the tears came to the grand equerry’s eyes; he seized her hand and kissed it."
"“狩猎期间留在这儿吧，”他说，“我没有什么长处，对这些拒绝已经习以为常了，但在接受您和中校的友情的同时，也请让我得到专业的技术人员的判断，证明将那些沼泽地的水排干不会带给您所说的公司任何风险，这样我才能放心地接受您的朋友们的好意。您是一位高贵的姑娘，尽管想到只能做您的朋友，我的心会痛，但我会以朋友身份为荣，并在任何时候、任何场合向您证明这一点。”","“Stay during the hunt,” he said; “my want of merit has accustomed me to these refusals; but while accepting your friendship and that of the colonel, you must let me satisfy myself by the judgment of competent scientific men, that the draining of those marshes will be no risk to the company you speak of, before I agree to the generous offer of your friends.You are a noble girl, and though my heart aches to think I can only be your friend, I will glory in that title, and prove it to you at all times and in all seasons.”"
"“这样的话，公爵先生，就让我们保守这个秘密吧。我不会让别人知道我的选择，至少我觉得要到我母亲完全康复为止。我希望我和未来夫婿得到的第一个祝福来自她的双眼。”","“In that case, Monsieur le duc, let us keep our secret.My choice will not be known, at least I think not, until after my mother’s complete recovery.I should like our first blessing to come from her eyes.”"
"第二十九章 大结局","Chapter XXIX Conclusion"
"“女士们，”客人们正要各自就寝时，卡迪央亲王说道，“我知道你们当中有好几位提议明天和我们一起去围猎，而我有义务提醒你们，如果你们想做狩猎女神狄安娜，那你们就必须像狄安娜一样，天亮就起来。八点半集合。我这辈子，见过许多女人表现得比男人更有勇气，但却坚持不了多久.你们要有坚定的决心，才能一整天都呆在马背上，中间只能像真正的男女猎手一样，停下来匆匆吃顿早饭。你们还是决定要一展女骑手的风采吗？”","“Ladies,” said the Prince de Cadignan, as the guests were about to separate for the night, “I know that several of you propose to follow the hounds with us tomorrow, and it becomes my duty to tell you that if you will be Dianas you must rise, like Diana, with the dawn.The meet is for half-past eight o’clock.I have in the course of my life seen many women display greater courage than men, but for a few seconds only; and you will need a strong dose of resolution to keep you on horseback the whole day, barring a halt for breakfast, which we shall take, like true hunters and huntresses, on the nail.Are you still determined to show yourselves trained horse-women?”"
"“亲王，我非去不可。”莫黛斯特机敏地说道。","“Prince, it is necessary for me to do so,” said Modeste, adroitly."
"“我为自己作担保。”德肖利厄公爵夫人说。","“I answer for myself,” said the Duchesse de Chaulieu."
"“那我为我的儿媳迪亚娜作担保，她是名副其实的。”亲王补充道,“那么，你们都坚持要去？不过，为夫人、德韦纳伊小姐,以及其他呆在家里的人着想，我会安排把鹿赶到池塘尽头来。”","“And I for my daughter Diane; she is worthy of her name,” added the prince.“So, then, you all persist in your intentions?However, I shall arrange, for the sake of Madame and Mademoiselle de Verneuil and others of the party who stay at home, to drive the stag to the further end of the pond.”"
"“尽管放心吧，女士们，”待皇家猎队队长离开客厅后，德卢东亲王说道，“我们会把所谓的‘匆匆吃顿早饭’安排在一个舒适的帐篷下。”","“Make yourself quite easy, mesdames,” said the Prince de Loudon, when the Royal Huntsman had left the room; “that breakfast ‘on the nail’ will take place under a comfortable tent.”"
"第二天拂晓时分，所有的迹象都预示了一个好天气。天空蒙着一层灰蒙蒙的薄雾，块块亮处透出最纯净的蓝色，西北风已经开始吹动着棉絮般的小云朵，中午之前，肯定就能把天空拂净。猎队离开城堡时，猎队队长、德雷托雷公爵和德卢东亲王因为没有女士要护卫，便骑在了前面。他们被诺曼底的晚秋美景吸引了，树上仍有鲜艳的红棕色树叶，映衬着城堡的白色建筑群以及高耸的烟囱。","The next day, at dawn, all signs gave promise of a glorious day.The skies, veiled by a slight gray vapor, showed spaces of purest blue, and would surely be swept clear before mid-day by the northwest wind, which was already playing with the fleecy cloudlets.As the hunting party left the chateau, the Master of the Hunt, the Duc de Rhetore, and the Prince de Loudon, who had no ladies to escort, rode in the advance, noticing the white masses of the chateau, with its rising chimneys relieved against the brilliant red-brown foliage which the trees in Normandy put on at the close of a fine autumn."
"“这些女士真走运，碰上这么好的天气。”德雷托雷公爵说道。","“The ladies are fortunate in their weather,” remarked the Duc de Rhetore."
"“咳，虽然她们自吹自擂，”德卡迪央亲王回答道，“但我觉得她们会让我们自己打猎的！”","“Oh, in spite of all their boasting,” replied the Prince de Cadignan, “I think they will let us hunt without them!”"
"“要不是每个人都有个献殷勤的护卫，倒有可能会那样。”公爵说。","“So they might, if each had not a squire,” said the duke."
"就在这时，这些意志坚定的猎手们——德卢东亲王和德雷托雷公爵是宁录的后人，是圣日耳曼近郊最好的射手——被一阵嘈杂的争吵声吸引住了，他们策马赶到罗桑布赖森林入口处的一块空地上，那里因覆满苔藓的草皮而出名，是集会的指定地点。争吵的原因很快就明了了。德卢东亲王十分崇拜英国习俗，便组建了一只自己的完全英式的猎队，由猎队队长调遣。此时，他的一个队员，一个小个子的英国人——金发白肤、傲慢无礼、十分冷漠，几乎说不了几句法语，穿着干净整洁，这是所有的英国人，甚至是下等阶层的特点——已经站在这块空地的一边。约翰·巴里穿着一件短双排扣常礼服，扣子紧紧地扣在腰部，布料鲜红，扣子上刻着德韦纳伊家徽，还穿着一条白色皮马裤，一双长筒靴，一件带条纹的马甲，戴着黑丝绒领子和披肩。他手里拿着一条小猎鞭，手腕上用丝绳系着一把铜号。这个人是首席猎犬管理员，身后跟着两条纯种猎狗——是猎狐狗，白毛上缀着红褐色斑点，腿很长，鼻子灵敏，头部细长，头顶上长着两只小耳朵。这位猎犬管理员——在英格兰郡颇有名气，德卢东亲王花大价钱才把他弄到手——管理着十五匹马和六十只英国猎犬，这要花费德韦纳伊公爵很大一笔开销。德韦纳伊公爵并不擅长狩猎，却纵容他的儿子沉醉于这一王族不可或缺的嗜好。","At this moment the attention of these determined huntsmen—for the Prince de Loudon and the Duc de Rhetore are of the race of Nimrod, and the best shots of the faubourg Saint-Germain—was attracted by a loud altercation; and they spurred their horses to an open space at the entrance to the forest of Rosembray, famous for its mossy turf, which was appointed for the meet.The cause of the quarrel was soon apparent.The Prince de Loudon, afflicted with anglomania, had brought out his own hunting establishment, which was exclusively Britannic, and placed it under orders of the Master of the Hunt.Now, one of his men, a little Englishman,—fair, pale, insolent, and phlegmatic, scarcely able to speak a word of French, and dressed with a neatness which distinguishes all Britons, even those of the lower classes,—had posted himself on one side of this open space.John Barry wore a short frock-coat, buttoned tightly at the waist, made of scarlet cloth, with buttons bearing the De Verneuil arms, white leather breeches, top-boots, a striped waistcoat, and a collar and cape of black velvet.He held in his hand a small hunting-whip, and hanging to his wrist by a silken cord was a brass horn.This man, the first whipper-in, was accompanied by two thorough-bred dogs,—fox-hounds, white, with liver spots, long in the leg, fine in the muzzle, with slender heads, and little ears at their crests.The huntsman—famous in the English county from which the Prince de Loudon had obtained him at great cost—was in charge of an establishment of fifteen horses and sixty English hounds, which cost the Duc de Verneuil, who was nothing of a huntsman, but chose to indulge his son in this essentially royal taste, an enormous sum of money to keep up."
"好，约翰到时，发现另外三个管理两队皇家猎犬的猎犬管理员，已经用马车载着猎犬抢先到了。他们是德卡迪央亲王三个最得力的猎犬管理员，而且在性格和典型的法国服饰上，都跟傲慢无礼的阿尔比恩的代表形成了鲜明对比。这些亲王的亲信们，个个都戴着扁平、宽大的大沿三角帽，帽子下面露出黝黑且布满皱纹的脸庞，三双眼睛神采奕奕。和所有在运动中享受激情的人一样，他们瘦而健壮，精力充沛。三个人都挎着当比埃尔大铜号，铜号上缠着绿色毛绒丝带，只露出黄铜的喇叭管。不过，他们其实是用眼神和嗓音看管狗的。那些高贵的动物，远比此刻正在倾听国王演说的臣子们更忠诚、更温顺。它们身上都有白色、黑色，或者红褐色的斑点做标记，每一只的表情都跟拿破仑的士兵一样与众不同，稍有动静，它们的眼睛就像宝石一样闪闪发光。其中有一条狗来自普瓦图，腰身很短，肩部很宽，膝盖较矮，双耳下垂；另外一只来自英格兰，浑身雪白，像灵缇一样没有肚子，耳朵小小的，天生适宜奔跑。两只狗都很年轻，焦躁不安、迫不及待地嗥叫着，相反，那些伤痕累累的老猎犬则静静地趴在那里，头搁在前爪上，像野人一样把耳朵贴在地上。","Now, when John arrived on the ground, he found himself forestalled by three other whippers-in, in charge of two of the royal packs of hounds which had been brought there in carts.They were the three best huntsmen of the Prince de Cadignan, and presented, both in character and in their distinctively French costume, a marked contrast to the representative of insolent Albion.These favorites of the Prince, each wearing full-brimmed, three-cornered hats, very flat and very wide-spreading, beneath which grinned their swarthy, tanned, and wrinkled faces, lighted by three pairs of twinkling eyes, were noticeably lean, sinewy, and vigorous, like men in whom sport had become a passion.All three were supplied with immense horns of Dampierre, wound with green worsted cords, leaving only the brass tubes visible; but they controlled their dogs by the eye and voice.Those noble animals were far more faithful and submissive subjects than the human lieges whom the king was at that moment addressing; all were marked with white, black, or liver spots, each having as distinctive a countenance as the soldiers of Napoleon, their eyes flashing like diamonds at the slightest noise.One of them, brought from Poitou, was short in the back, deep in the shoulder, low-jointed, and lop-eared; the other, from England, white, fine as a greyhound with no belly, small ears, and built for running.Both were young, impatient, and yelping eagerly, while the old hounds, on the contrary, covered with scars, lay quietly with their heads on their forepaws, and their ears to the earth like savages."
"一看英国人过来了，这些皇家猎犬和猎犬管理员们彼此看了看，好像在说：“要是我们不能单独打猎，那就有辱我们作为国王侍从的身份了。”","As the Englishman came up, the royal dogs and huntsmen looked at each other as though they said, “If we cannot hunt by ourselves his Majesty’s service is insulted.”"
"法国老猎犬管理员雅坎·拉鲁利先生和年轻的英国人约翰·巴里，开始只是开开玩笑，却很快吵了起来，愈演愈烈。两位亲王从远处就猜到了争吵的内容是什么，猎队队长快马过去，以命令的语气说了句话，便结束了争吵：","Beginning with jests, the quarrel presently grew fiercer between Monsieur Jacquin La Roulie, the old French whipper-in, and John Barry, the young islander.The two princes guessed from afar the subject of the altercation, and the Master of the Hunt, setting spurs to his horse, brought it to an end by saying, in a voice of authority:—"
"“谁去森林里赶猎物来着？”","“Who drew the wood?”"
"“我，老爷。”英国人说道。","“I, monseigneur,” said the Englishman."
"“很好。”德卡迪央亲王说道，开始听巴里的报告。","“Very good,” said the Prince de Cadignan, proceeding to take Barry’s report."
"无论狗还是人，在猎队队长面前都变得安静有礼，好像都意识到了他至高的尊贵。亲王布置了一天的工作，因为一次狩猎就像是一次战役，而查理十世的猎队队长就是森林里的拿破仑。多亏他为法国狩猎界引入了良好的体制，他才能专门思考狩猎的技巧和战略。现在，他从容地给德卢东亲王的团队安排了一项特殊任务。他料到王室猎犬会把鹿赶到位于城堡正前方的皇家森林里，而他们的任务就是在那之后把鹿赶到水边。亲王把最艰辛的活儿交给了他的老猎手们，然后又利用了英国人巴里用以在猎队立足的特长，给他机会去展示他的马和猎犬在野外的速度，这样，就很好地照顾到了两边人的自尊心。这样，两国的两种狩猎体系便可以并行不悖地发挥出最佳水平。","Dogs and men became silent and respectful before the Royal Huntsman, as though each recognized his dignity as supreme.The prince laid out the day’s work; for it is with a hunt as it is with a battle, and the Master of Charles X.‘s hounds was the Napoleon of forests.Thanks to the admirable system which he has introduced into French venery, he was able to turn his thoughts exclusively to the science and strategy of it.He now quietly assigned a special duty to the Prince de Loudon’s establishment, that of driving the stag to water, when, as he expected, the royal hounds had sent it into the Crown forest which outlined the horizon directly in front of the chateau.The prince knew well how to soothe the self-love of his old huntsmen by giving them the most arduous part of the work, and also that of the Englishman, whom he employed at his own speciality, affording him a chance to show the fleetness of his horses and dogs in the open.The two national systems were thus face to face and allowed to do their best under each other’s eyes."
"“老爷想让我们继续等吗？”拉鲁利恭敬地说道。","“Does monseigneur wish us to wait any longer?” said La Roulie, respectfully."
"“我知道你是什么意思，老朋友。”亲王说，“时候不早了，但——”","“I know what you mean, old friend,” said the prince.“It is late, but—”"
"“女士们来了。”第二个猎犬管理员说。","“Here come the ladies,” said the second whipper-in."
"就在这时，只见十六个骑手组成的队伍越来越近，领头的是四位戴着绿色面纱的女士。莫黛斯特由她的父亲、马厩大总管和拉布里埃陪同，走在最前头，旁边是由德赛里齐子爵护卫的德摩弗里纽斯公爵夫人。骑在她们后面的是德肖利厄公爵夫人，她正冲着身旁的卡那利微笑着，没有一丝怨恨的痕迹。他们来到空地，在那里，那些身穿红衣、佩带号角的猎手们被猎犬簇拥着，组成了一幅足以让凡德莫兰动笔的画面。德肖利厄公爵夫人虽然体态丰腴，但还是很有风度地骑在马背上，来到莫黛斯特跟前。头天晚上她一句话都没跟这个年轻女子说，现在她却觉得不去避开莫黛斯特，才符合自己的尊贵身份。","At that moment the cavalcade of sixteen riders was seen to approach at the head of which were the green veils of the four ladies.Modeste, accompanied by her father, the grand equerry, and La Briere, was in the advance, beside the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse whom the Vicomte de Serizy escorted.Behind them rode the Duchesse de Chaulieu, flanked by Canalis, on whom she was smiling without a trace of rancor.When they had reached the open space where the huntsmen with their red coats and brass bugles, surrounded by the hounds, made a picture worthy of Van der Meulen, the Duchesse de Chaulieu, who, in spite of her embonpoint, sat her horse admirably, rode up to Modeste, finding it more for her dignity not to avoid that young person, to whom the evening before she had not said a single word."
"猎队队长刚表扬完这些女士能够准时赶来，让人赞叹，埃莱奥诺尔就屈尊去观察莫黛斯特小手里那根闪闪发亮的精美马鞭，并礼貌地请莫黛斯特给她看看。","When the Master of the Hunt finished his compliments to the ladies on their amazing punctuality, Eleonore deigned to observe the magnificent whip which sparked in Modeste’s little hand, and graciously asked leave to look at it."
"“我从没见过比这更漂亮的马鞭，”她一边将马鞭给迪亚娜·德摩弗里纽斯看，一边说道，“它跟它的主人真配。”她把马鞭还给莫黛斯特，补充道。","“I have never seen anything of the kind more beautiful,” she said, showing it to Diane de Maufrigneuse.“It is in keeping with its possessor,” she added, returning it to Modeste."
"“公爵夫人，”德拉巴斯蒂小姐向拉布里埃投去温柔而又狡黠的一瞥，回答道，“您也必须承认，这件礼物来自未婚夫之手，有点儿奇怪吧。”","“You must admit, Madame la duchesse,” answered Mademoiselle de La Bastie, with a tender and malicious glance at La Briere, “that it is a rather strange gift from the hand of a future husband.”"
"“要是我的话，”德摩弗里纽斯夫人说，“我会把它当作一件纪念路易十四、彰显我权利的东西。”","“I should take it,” said Madame de Maufrigneuse, “as a declaration of my rights, in remembrance of Louis XIV.”"
"拉布里埃泪眼模糊，有一会儿都把缰绳给松了。不过，莫黛斯特又看了他一眼，让他不要表露出他的幸福之情。现在，围猎开始了。","La Briere’s eyes were suffused, and for a moment he dropped his reins; but a second glance from Modeste ordered him not to betray his happiness.The hunt now began."
"德埃鲁维尔公爵乘机低声对他幸运的情敌说道：“先生，我希望您会让您的妻子幸福，要是有任何用得着我的地方，请尽管吩咐。能为如此可爱的一对人儿的幸福尽些力，会让我感到十分高兴的。”","The Duc d’Herouville took occasion to say in a low voice to his fortunate rival; “Monsieur, I hope that you will make your wife happy; if I can be useful to you in any way, command my services; I should be only too glad to contribute to the happiness of so charming a pair.”"
"在这重大的日子里，事关爱情和财产的重大利益问题都敲定了。这天只给猎队队长带来了一个担忧，那就是鹿会不会跑过池塘，并在城堡前的草坪上被射杀。因为他这样水平的猎手就像象棋大师，在某些情况下能够预测将死王棋的阵势。这位幸福的老人如愿以偿，追猎十分精彩。而第三天的围猎下雨了，各位女士也就不再出场，让他松了口气。","This great day, in which such vast interests of heart and fortune were decided, caused but one anxiety to the Master of the Hunt,—namely, whether or not the stag would cross the pond and be killed on the lawn before the house; for huntsmen of his calibre are like great chess-players who can predict a checkmate under certain circumstances.The happy old man succeeded to the height of his wishes; the run was magnificent, and the ladies released him from his attendance upon them for the hunt of the next day but one,—which, however, turned out to be rainy."
"德韦纳伊公爵的客人们在罗桑布赖呆了五天。最后一天，《法兰西公报》宣布，德卡那利男爵被授予荣誉军团指挥官军衔，并被任命为驻卡尔斯鲁赫大使。","The Duc de Verneuil’s guests stayed five days at Rosembray.On the last day the Gazette de France announced the appointment of Monsieur le Baron de Canalis to the rank of commander of the Legion of honor, and to the post of minister at Carlsruhe."
"十二月初，德普兰为德拉巴斯蒂夫人动了手术。当她恢复视力后第一次看见埃内斯特·德拉布里埃时，她抓住莫黛斯特的手，在她耳边轻声说：“要是我，也会挑他的。”","When, early in the month of December, Madame de La Bastie, operated upon by Desplein, recovered her sight and saw Ernest de La Briere for the first time, she pressed Modeste’s hand and whispered in her ear, “I should have chosen him myself.”"
"第二年二月底，拉图奈尔已经签好所有普罗旺斯的地产契约。大约也是那个时候，拉巴斯蒂家族得到了国王给予的莫大荣誉，国王为两个年轻人签署了婚约，并批准将拉巴斯蒂家族的头衔和家徽传给拉布里埃，从此，这个头衔就变成了拉布里埃-拉巴斯蒂。大约四月底的时候，拉巴斯蒂的地产由宫廷特许定为限嗣继承。拉布里埃结婚的时候，证婚人是卡那利，还有那位他曾为其担任过五年秘书的内阁大臣。新娘的证婚人是德埃鲁维尔公爵和德普兰。米尼翁一家给了德普兰一份大礼，以表心意，并一直对他念念不忘、感激不尽。","Toward the last of February all the deeds for the estates in Provence were signed by Latournelle, and about that time the family of La Bastie obtained the marked honor of the king’s signature to the marriage contract and to the ordinance transmitting their title and arms to La Briere, who henceforth took the name of La Briere-La Bastie.The estate of La Bastie was entailed by letters-patent issued about the end of April.La Briere’s witnesses on the occasion of his marriage were Canalis and the minister whom he had served for five years as secretary.Those of the bride were the Duc d’Herouville and Desplein, whom the Mignons long held in grateful remembrance, after giving him magnificent and substantial proofs of their regard."
"今后，在这部关于我们礼仪和习俗的长篇故事里，我们可能还会再见到德拉布里埃-拉巴斯蒂先生和夫人。明眼人会注意到，跟一位受过教育且聪明伶俐的女子结为连理，是多么甜蜜、多么舒心的事情，因为莫黛斯特头脑聪明，不会去作卖弄文采的蠢事，她是她丈夫的骄傲和幸福，也是她的家人、以及她周围所有人的骄傲和幸福。","Later, in the course of this long history of our manners and customs, we may again meet Monsieur and Madame de La Briere-La Bastie; and those who have the eyes to see, will then behold how sweet, how easy, is the marriage yoke with an educated and intelligent woman; for Modeste, who had the wit to avoid the follies of pedantry, is the pride and happiness of her husband, as she is of her family and of all those who surround her."
