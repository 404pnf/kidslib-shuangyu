"第一章 引言","CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION"
"圣约翰说:""上帝就是爱。""我最初想写这本书时，曾经以为可以依托这句格言而十分顺利地完成全部的写作计划。我曾以为我能说，人类的各种爱只要与上帝代表的爱是相似的，就能称之为爱。因此，首先我要把我所说的赠予之爱和需求之爱区分开来。最典型的赠予之爱能促使人们努力工作，制定计划，积累钱财，只为家人未来的幸福，虽然到那时自己既无法目睹也分享不到那种幸福。而最典型的需求之爱是将孤独或受到惊吓的孩子送回到母亲的怀抱的那种爱。","""God is love，""says st.John. When I first tried to write this book I thought that his maxim would provide me with a very plain highroad through the whole subject. I thought I should be able to say that human loves deserved to be called loves at all just in so far as they resembled that Love which is God. The first distinction I made was therefore between what I called Gift-love and Need-love. The typical example of Gift-love would be that love which moves a man to work and plan and Save for the future well-being of his family which he will die without sharing or seeing; of the second，that which sends a lonely or frightened child to its mother's arms."
"哪一种更像上帝之爱是毫无疑问的。上帝之爱是赠予之爱。圣父把其全部和其所有统统都给予了圣子。圣子把自己交还给圣父，把自己交还给世界，而且他是为了世界，把自己交还给圣父，因此把(自身之中的)世界也交还给了圣父。","There was no doubt which was more like Love Himself. Divine Love is Gift-love. The Father gives all He is and has to the Son. The Son gives Himself back to the Father，and gives Himself to the world，and for the world to the Father，and thus gives the world (in Himself) back to the Father too."
"而从另一方面讲，我们认为上帝的生活中最不该有的东西就是需求之爱了吧?上帝什么东西都不缺，但我们的需求之爱却像柏拉图所说的""贫穷之子""。这是我们的真实本性在意识上的切实反映。我们生来是无助的。一旦我们充分意识到这一点，孤独感就会随之而来。我们在肉体、情感和思想上都需要他人，若我们想有所认识，哪怕是认识我们自己，都需要与他人交流。","And what，on the other hand，can be less like anything we believe of God's life than Need-love? He lacks nothing，but our Need-love，as Plato saw，is ""the son of Poverty."" It is the accurate reflection in consciousness of our actual nature. We are born helpless. As soon as we are fully conscious we discover loneliness. We need others physically，emotionally，intellectually; we need them if we are to know anything，even ourselves."
"我曾经期待着这本书可以简单地歌颂第一种爱，贬损第二种爱。现在看来，许多当时我想要写的似乎仍然是正确的。我依然认为，如果我们所说的爱仅仅代表着一种对被爱的渴望，那我们就落入了一种很可悲的境地。但是，(与我的导师麦克唐纳不同)现在我并不认为，如果仅把爱理解为渴望被爱，就是把绝非是爱的东西错当成了爱。我不能否认*爱*这个词也指需求之爱。每次我试图沿着这样的思路作深入的思考时，最终得到的都是迷惑和矛盾。现实比我想象的复杂多了。","I was looking forward to writing some fairly easy panegyrics on the first sort of love and disparagements of the second. And much of what I was going to say still seems to me to be true.I still think that if all we mean by our love is a craving to be loved，we are in a very deplorable state. But I would not now say (with my master，MacDonald that if we mean only this craving we are mistaking for love something that is not love at all. I cannot now deny the name *love* to Need-love. Every time I have tried to think the thing out along those lines I have ended in puzzles and contradictions. The reality is more complicated than I supposed."
"首先，如果我们不把需求之爱称为""爱""，那么我们就篡改了包括母语在内的太多数语育.当然，语言不是绝对可靠的指导准则，不过，它虽有缺点，但也积淀了大量的真知灼见和经验.要是你一开始就不尊重语言，语言自有办法让你今后尝到苦头。我们最好不要像汉普蒂·邓普蒂那样任意胡乱地使用词语。","First of all，we do violence to most languages，including our own，if we do not call Need-love ""love."" Of course language is not an infallible guide，but it contains，with all its defects，a good deal of stored insight and experience. If you begin by flouting it，it has a way of avenging itself later on. We had better not follow Humpty Dumpty in making words mean whatever we please."
"其次，如果把需求之爱称为""纯粹的自私""。我们就得小心自己的用词了。*纯粹*，一贯是个危险的字眼。毫无疑问，正如我们所有的冲动一样，需求之爱也可以被自私地放纵。专横而贪婪地寻求爱是可怕的，但是在日常生活中，没人会认为孩子跑到母亲那里寻求安慰是自私的举动，也不会认为大人从同伴中""找个伴儿""是自私的的行为。无论大人还是小孩，那些很少这样做的人并不一定就是最无私的。但凡感受到了需求之量，我们就有了拒绝或是彻底克制它的理由，而感受不到这种爱通常是冷酷的自我主义的标志。既然在现实中我们都需要彼此(""人独居不好，那么这种需求未能在意识上表现为需求之爱一一换句话说，也就是那种认为独居*是*好事的虚幻感觉一一就是一种不健康的精神症状，就像食欲不振是医学上的不健康症状一样，因为人确实是需要食物的。","Secondly，we must be cautious about calling Need-love ""mere selfishness."" *Mere* is always a dangerous word.  No doubt Need-love，like all our impulses， can be selfishly indulged. A tyrannous and gluttonous demand for affection can be a horrible thing. But in ordinary life no one calls a child selfish because it turns for comfort to its mother; nor an adult who tums to his fellow ""for company."" Those，whether children or adults，who do so least are not usually the most selfless. Where Need-love is felt there may be reasons for denying or totally mortifying it; but not to feel it is in general the mark of the cold egoist. Since we do in reality need one another(""it is not good for man to be alone"")，then the failure of this need to appear as Need-love in consciousness — in other words，the illusory feeling that it *is* good for us to be alone — is a bad spuritual symptom; just as lack of appetite is a bad medical symptom because men do really need food."
"第三，我们来谈一些更为重要的东西。所有基督徒都同意，人的精神健康状况与其对上帝的爱是完全成正比的。但是，从其本质上讲，人对上帝的爱必定在很大程度上总是一种需求之爱，并且常常完全就是一种需求之爱。这在祈求宽恕我们犯下的罪过或者从苦难中寻求援助时尤为明显。但是从长远看，随着我们逐渐认识到一一认识必定是不断提高的一一我们全部的存在实质上是一种巨大的需求，这种认识可能会更加明显，这是对上帝发出的不完整的、试探性的、空虚却又混乱的呼求，因为上帝能够将纠缠在一起的东西解开来，也能将零散的东西串联起来。我并不是说人除了纯粹的需求之爱以外，就不可能再带给上帝任何其他的东西。崇高的灵魂或许会告诉我们超出需求之爱的境界。但我认为这些灵魂也会第一个告诉我们，一旦人们胆敢认为自己可以生活在那种撞界中，并从此以后抛弃了需求的成分，那么那种境界便不再会是真正的恩典，而将变成新柏拉回主义的幻想，甚至最终论为邪恶的幻想。《效法基督》指出，""没有最低者也就无所谓最高者气只有狂妄和愚蠢的受造之物才会在造物主面前自夸""我决不向你讨要什么，我无私地爱着你气人们要是对上帝表现出近乎赠予之爱的爱，那么他们必将很快，甚至当时.就会与那个税吏一起捶胸，向唯一真正的给予者诉说他们的贫乏。上帝也会这样安排的.对于我们的需求之爱，上帝这样说t""凡劳苦担重的人，可以到我这里来。""或者如《旧约如中所说，""你要大大张口，我就给你充满""。","But thirdly，we come to something far more important. Every Christian would agree that a man's spiritual health is exactly proportional to his love for God. But man's love for God ，from the very nature of the case，must always be very largely，and must often be entirely，a Need-love. This is obvious when we implore forgiveness for our sins or support in our tribulations. But in the long run it is perhaps even more apparent in our growing — for it ought to be growing — awareness that our whole being by its very nature is one vast need; incomplete，preparatory， empty yet cluttered, crying out for Him who can untie things that are now knotted together and tie up things that are still dangling loose. I do not say that man can never bring to God anything at all but sheer Need-love. Exalted souls may tell us of a reach beyond that. But they would also，I think，be the first to tell us that those heights would cease to be true Graces，would become Neo-Platonic or finally diabolical illusions，the moment a man dared to think that he could live on them and henceforth drop out the element of need. ""The highest，""says the *Imitation*，""does not stand without the lowest."" It would be a bold and silly creature that came before its Creator with the boast ""I'm no beggar. I love you disinterestedly."" Those who come nearest to a Gift-love for God will next moment，even at the very same moment，be beating their breasts with the publican and laying their indigence before the only real Giver. And God will have it so. He addresses our Need-love: ""Come unto me all ye that travail and are heavy-laden，""or，in the Old Testament, ""Open your mouth wide and I will fill it."""
"因此，最伟大的需求之爱要么是与人最高尚、最健康以及最现实的精神状态相吻合，要么至少是其主要组成部分。这就出现了一种非常奇怪的推论：人从某种意义上看最不像上帝的时候就是最接近上帝的时候。还有什么会比富足与贫乏、君权与谦卑、正义与悔过、无限的力量与求助的呼喊更互不相像呢?第一次想到这个悖论时，我大为震惊，也因此打消了想要写书讨论爱的所有念头.我们面对这个悖论，似乎就只能产生这样的结果.","Thus one Need-love，the greatest of all，either coincides with or at least makes a main ingredient in man's highest，healthiest，and most realistic spritual condition. A very strange corollary follows. Man approaches God most nearly when he is in one sense least like God. For what can be more unlike than fullness and need，sovereignty and humility; righteousness and penitence，limitless power and a cry for help? This paradox staggered me when I first ran into it; it also wrecked all my previous attempts to write about love. When we face it，something like this seems to result."
"我们必须区分两种可能被称为""接近上帝""的情况。第一种是与上帝的相似性.我认为上帝早已在其创造的万物中体现了与其自身的某种相似性。空间和时间以各自的形式印证了上帝的伟大，所有生命证明了上帝的多产，动物的生命反映了上帝的活力。人类由于有了理性而具有比上述种种更重要的相似性。我们认为天使具有人类所没有的相似性：永生不死和直觉知识.从这个角度讲，所有人(不论好人坏人)、所有的天使(包括那些堕落天使)都要比动物更像上帝，从这个意义上讲，他们的本性更""接近""神性。而第二种我们可以称为趋向的接近。如果这是我们想要表达的一个人""最接近""上帝的状态，就是当他最为确定且最快速地使自己与上帝融合、接近上帝的视野和沐搭上帝荣光的状态。我们一旦把相似之接近和趋向之接近区分开来，就会明白二者未必吻合，可能是一致的，也可能是不一致的。","We must distinguish two things which might both possibly be called ""nearness to God."" One is likeness to God. God has impressed some sort of likeness to Himself，I suppose，in all that He has made. Space and time，in their own fashion，mirror His greatness; all life，His fecundity; animal life，His activity. Man has a more important likeness than these by being rational. Angels，we believe，have likenesses which Man lacks: immortality and intuitive knowledge. In that way all men， whether good or bad，all angels including those that fell，are more like God than the animals are. Their natures are in this sense ""nearer"" to the Divine Nature. But，secondly，there is what we may call nearness of approach. If this is what we mean，the states in which a man is ""nearest"" to God are those in which he is most surely and swiftly approaching his final union with God，vision of God and enjoyment of God. And as soon as we distinguish nearness-by-likeness and nearness-of-approach，we see that they do not necessarily coincide. They may or may not."
"或许打个比方会有助于理解吧。假设我们走在山路上，山那边的村庄是我们的家园.中午我们到了一个悬崖顶上，从空间上讲，我们离村子非常近，因为村子就在悬崖下面。我们可以随手丢块石头下去，但是我们不能像攀岩高手那样顺岩而下，只能绕路，或许有五英里吧。从静态的角度讲，我们在所绕的路上的许多个地方都比在悬崖上坐着时离村子更远，但这仅仅是就静态而言的。用发展的眼光看，我们离家越来越""近""了，就快要能泡澡、喝到茶水了。","Perhaps an analogy may help. Let us suppose that we are doing a mountain walk to the village which is our home. At mid-day we come to the top of a cliff where we are，in space，very near it because it is just below us. We could drop a stone into it. But as we are no cragsmen we can't get down. We must go a long way round; five miles，maybe. At many points during that *détour* we shall，statically，be farther from the village than we were when we sat above the cliff. But only statically. In terms of progress we shall be far ""nearer"" our baths and teas."
"因为上帝是神圣的、全能的、有统治力和创造力的，因此很明显从某种意义上说，无论幸福、力量、自由和能产性(思想上的或身体上的)出现在人生的何处，都构成了与上帝的相似性，并且以这种方式建立起了与上帝的接近。但没有人认为自己所拥有的这些禀赋与我们的神圣化有必然关联。没有一种财富是通往天堂的通行证。","Since God is blessed，omnipotent，sovereign and creative，there is obviously a sense in which happiness，strength，freedom and fertility (whether of mind or body)，wherever they appear in human life，constitute likenesses，and in that way proximities，to God. But no one supposes that the possession of these gifts has any necessary connection with our sanctification. No kind of riches is a passport to the  Kingdom of Heaven."
"在悬崖顶上时，我们离村子很近，但不管在那里坐多久，我们都不会商淋踏和茶水更近一些。这里的道理也是一样的，与上帝的相似性以及从某种意义上讲的与上帝的接近，是上帝赋予特定生灵及其特定状态的，而且这个过程早己结束，并已经根植于万物之中了。由相似带来的与上帝的接近永远不会仅仅因为相似性本身而变得再近一些。但是由趋向性带来的与上帝的接近，根据其定义，是可以更加接近上帝的。相似性是赐给我们的一一无论我们是否心怀感激，无论它是否得到了恰当的利用。而趋向性，不管上帝的恩典开始如何引导，如何支撑，都需要我们做点什么。所有生物通过不同方式被创造出来，反映了上帝的各种样子。这个过程无需他们的参与，甚至也不管他们是否乐意。他们并非因此而成为上帝之子。他们通过成为上帝之子而挟得的相似性，不是形象或长相上的相似性.从某个方面讲，这远超出了相似性，因为这是与上帝意志的融合或统一，然而这与我们一直思考的所有差异是一致的。因此，正如一位优秀作家所说，现世中我们对上帝的效法必然是对上帝化身的效法。这出自我们的自愿，并且不同于上帝加诸我们本性或各个阶段的任何相似性。我们的榜样是耶稣，不仅是旬在十字架上受难的耶稣，也是工作中的、大街上的、人群中的耶稣，还有面对喧嚷的召唤和粗暴的反对的耶稣、失去了安宁和隐私的耶稣、忙于应对各种阻挠和干扰的耶稣。以上种种是如此奇异，完全不像与上帝本身有什么联系，而它已经很明显不仅像，而且就是人类生活条件下的上帝的生活。","At the cliffs top we are near the village，but however long we sit there we shall never be any nearer to our bath and our tea. So here; the likeness，and in that sense nearness，to Himself which God has conferred upon certain creatures and certain states of those creatures is something finished，built in. What is near Him by likeness is never，by that fact alone，going to be any nearer. But nearness of approach is，by definition，increasing nearness. And whereas the likeness is given to us-and can be received with or without thanks，can be used or abused-the approach，however initiated and supported by Grace，is something we must do. Creatures are made in their varying ways images of God without their own collaboration or even consent. It is not so that they become sons of God. And the likeness they receive by sonship is not that of images or portraits. It is in one way more than likeness，for it is union or unity with God in will; but this is consistent with all the differences we have been considering. Hence，as a better writer has said，our imitation of God in this life-that is，our willed imitation as distinct from any of the likenesses which He has impressed upon our natures or states-must be an imitation of God incarnate: our model is the Jesus，not only of Calvary，but of the workshop，the roads，the crowds，the clamorous demands and surly oppositions，the lack of all peace and privacy，the interruptions. For this，so strangely unlike anything we can attribute to the Divine life in itself，is apparently not only like，but is，the Divine life operating under human conditions."
"我现在必须解释一下，为什么我认为这个区别对于所要讨论的爱是必要的.我脑海里一直在比较圣约翰所说的""上帝就是爱""和一位现代作家 (M.丹尼斯·德·鲁日蒙)所说的""只有爱不会变成神时，爱才不会论为魔鬼""后一种观点当然也可以换个说法产爱一旦成了神，就会沦为魔鬼.""对于我来说，这种比较起到了不可或缺的预防作用。要是忽略了这种比较，""上帝就是爱""这一真理可能会被我们偷偷地倒过来，变成了""爱就是上帝"".","1 must now explain why I have found this distinction necessary to any treatment of our loves. St.John's saying that God is love has long been balanced in my mind against the remark of a modern author (M. Denis de Rougemon) ""love ceases to be a demon only when he ceases to be a god""; which of course can be re-stated in the form ""begins to be a demon the moment he begins to be a god."" This balance seems to me an indispensable safeguard. If we ignore it the truth that God is love may slyly come to mean for us the converse，that love is God."
"我认为，所有想过这个问题的人都明自M.德·鲁日蒙的意思。每种人类之爱在处于最佳境界时往往都会有一种趋向，宣称其具有某种神的权威。它的声音听起来像是上帝本身的意愿。它告诉我们不要计较得失，耍全心地投入。它还试图凌驾于其他一切主张之上，并且暗指任何""以爱之名""而做出的虔诚行为都因此是合法的，甚至是值得称赞的。情爱和对国家的爱会因此试图""神化自身份""大家对此都是很清楚的。不过，亲人之爱也会神化自身，朋友之爱可能也会如此，只是方式不同罢了。此处先不赞述，因为我会在下面的章节中反复谈到这一问题。","I suppose that everyone who has thought about the matter will see what M. de Rougemont meant. Every human love，at its height, has a tendency to claim for itself a divine authority. Its voice tends to sound as if it were the will of God Himself.It tells us not to count the cost，it demands of us a total commitment，it attempts to over-ride all other claims and insinuates that any action which is sincerely done ""for love's sake"" is thereby lawful and even meritorious. That erotic love and love of one's country may thus attempt to ""become gods"" is generally recognised. But family affection may do the same. So，in a different way, may friendship. I shall not here elaborate the point，for it will meet us again and again in later chapters."
"现在必须注意的是，自然之爱提出这些亵渎神灵的主张时，并非是扯于最差的自然状态，而是处在最崇高的自然状态，她于我们的父辈将其形容为""纯洁'或者""高贵""之时。这在情爱方面尤其明显，真诚的、真正具有自我牺牲精神的激情，会以一种似乎是上帝的声音向我们诉说，而纯粹的兽欲或轻锐的性欲却不会如此。这种性欲会用各种方式来腐蚀那些沉溺其中的人，但不会以借用上帝的方式，人们会对这斟青感作出反应，但不会敬重这些情感，即日同挠痒的人不会敬重痒这种感觉一样。愚蠢的女人对娇惯的孩子的一时放纵实际上是一种自我放纵。当这种放纵一直持续时，孩子就变成了一个活生生的玩偶，这与(很大程度上) ""为子而活""的妇女那种深厚而狭隘的奉献相比，这种放纵更不可能""神化""。我也倾向于认为，那种由啤酒和军乐队所激发出来的爱国之情是不会让人们为了祖国做出太大的坏事(也不会做出太大的好事)的。多喝一杯酒，与乐队齐鸣，这种爱国之情很可能就会消失得无影无踪了。","Now it must be noticed that the natural loves make this blasphemous claim not when they are in their worst，but when they are in their best，natural condition; when they are what our grandfathers called ""pure"" or ""noble."" This is especially obvious in the erotic sphere. A faithful and genuinely self-sacriflcing passion will speak to us with what seems the voice of God. Merely animal or frivolous lust will not. It will corrupt its addict in a dozen ways，but not in that way; a man may act upon such feelings but he can not revere them any more than a man who scratches reveres the itch. A silly woman's temporary indulgence，which is really self-indulgence，to a spoiled child-her living doll while the fit lasts — is much less likely to ""become a god"" than the deep，narrow devotion of a woman who (quite really)""lives for her son."" And I am inclined to think that the sort of love for a man's country which is worked up by beer and brass bands will not lead him to do much harm (or much good) for her sake. It will probably be fully discharged by ordering another drink and joining in the chorus."
"当然，这应该在我们预料之中。我们所有的爱都不会宣称自己是神圣的，直到其宣称变得貌似有理。而在这些爱本身与上帝、与上帝之爱具有一种真正的相似性这种宣称是不会貌似有理的之前。大家这里可别误会了。我们所说的赠予之爱的确是与上帝相似的，并且在所有赠予之爱中，那些最无限的和不知瘟倦的赠予是与上帝最相似的。诗人对赠予之爱的一切咏叹是千真万确的。赠予之爱所表现出的欢乐、活力、耐心、乐于宽恕、为其所爱谋求利益的渴望，所有这一切都是一种真正的和几乎迷人的上帝生命的形象。在这个形象面前，我们应当感谢""赐予人类这些力量""的上帝。实际上，说明白点，我们可以说那些爱得伟大的人是""接近""上帝的，但这当然是""相似之接近""，它本身不会产生""趋向之接近飞这种相似是早已赋予我们的，它与那种缓慢而痛苦的趋近之路是没有必然联系的，因为趋向是需要我们自己去完成的任务(虽然不会毫无援助)。然而，同时，相似性又那么光芒四射，我们才会把相似误认为相同。我们可能把只献给上帝的无条件的忠贞也赋予人类之爱中。这样一来，这些爱就变成了神，也沦为魔鬼。然后这些爱将会把我们毁灭，同时也毁灭自己，因为那些自然之爱在成为神之后便不再是爱了。它们仍然会被称为爱，但事实上却变成了恨的各种复杂形式。","And this of course is what we ought to expect. Our loves do not make their claim to divinity until the claim becomes plausible. It does not become plausible until there is in them a real resemblance to God ，to Love Himself. Let us here make no mistake. Our Gift-loves are really God-like; and among our Gift-loves those are most God-like which are most boundless and unwearied in giving. All the things the poets say about them are true. Their joy，their patience， their patience，their readiness to forgive，their desire for the good of the beloved all this is a real and all but adorable image of the Divine life. In its presence we are right to thank God ""who has given such power to men."" We may say，quite truly and in an intelligible sense，that those who love greatly are ""near"" to God. But of course it is ""nearness by likeness."" It will not of itself produce ""nearness of approach."" The likeness has been given us. It has no necessary connection with that slow and painful approach which must be our own (though by no means our unaided) task. Meanwhile，however，the likeness is a splendour. That is why we may mistake Like for Same. We may give our human loves the unconditional allegiance which we owe only to God.Then they become gods:then they become demons. Then they will destroy us，and also destroy themselves. For natural loves that are allowed to become gods do not remain loves. They are still called so，but can become in fact complicated forms of hatred."
"我们所说的需求之爱或许是贪婪而苛刻的，但这些爱不会以神灵自居。这些爱(从相似性上讲)不够接近上帝，也就不会有此奢求。","Our Need-loves may be greedy and exacting but they do not set up to be gods. They are not near enough (by likeness) to God to attempt that."
"由上可见，对于人类之爱，我们要避免成为盲目崇拜者，也要避免成为""批判者'。对情欲之爱以及""夫妇之爱""的盲目崇拜是十九世纪文学的一个通病。罗伯特·勃朗宁、查尔斯·金斯利以及考文垂·帕特莫尔的作品有时把坠入爱何等同于神圣化。这些作家习惯性地用家庭而非天国作为""尘世""的对照面。而我们的看法恰恰相反。那些批判者把父辈对爱的赞美之词都指责为无病呻吟和多愁善感。他们总是拔起自然之爱沾满泥巴的根茎，将其曝光于众。但我认为，我们不应该听信""聪明绝顶的人，也不应听信愚蠢至极的人。没有最低者也就无所谓最高者。植物不仅需要上面的阳光，还需要下面的根茎，而根茎必定是沾满泥土的。只要把它留在花园中而不是撒在书桌上，那些泥土大都是干净的。人类之爱能够成为上帝之爱的光辉形象，不会达不到这一点，但也决不会有所超越。相似之接近有时会促进趋向之接近，有时也会阻碍趋向之接近。有时或许既不促进它也 不阻碍它。","It follows from what has been said that we must join neither the idolaters nor the ""debunkers"" of human love. Idolatry both of erotic love and of ""the domestic affections"" was the great error of nineteenth-century literature. Browning Kingsley，and Patmore sometimes talk as if they thought that falling in love was the same thing as sanctification; the novelists habitually oppose to ""the World"" not the Kingdom of Heaven but the home. We live in the reaction against this. The debunkers stigmatise as slush and sentimentality a very great deal of what their fathers said in praise of love. They are always pulling up and exposing the grubby roots of our natural loves. But I take it we must listen neither ""to the over-wise nor to the over-follish giant."" The highest does not stand without the lowest. A plant must have roots below as well as sunlight above and roots must be grubby. Much of the grubbiness is clean dirt if only you will leave it in the garden and not keep on sprinkling it over the library table. The human loves can be glorious images of Divine love. No less than that: but also no more — proximities of likeness which in one instance may help，and in another may hinder，proximity of approach. Sometimes perhaps they have not very much to do with it either way."
"第六章 仁爱","CHAPTER SIX CHARITY"
"威廉·莫里斯曾写过一首诗，叫作《爱已足够》。据说有人曾简要地对它作出评论""还不够""。这就是这本书的任务。自然之景不是自给自足的。有一种东西，一开始被粗略地描述为""礼貌和常识""，随后表现为善良，最后在特定的关系中表现为基督徒的全部生活，这种东西，最终要对纯粹的感觉有所帮助，如果那种感觉想要保持甜蜜的话。","William Morris wrote a poem called ""Love Is Enough"" and someone is said to have reviewed it briefly in the words ""It isn't."" Such has been the burden of this book. The natural loves are not self-sufficient. Something else，at first vaguely described as ""decency and common sense，""but later revealed as goodness，and finally as the whole Christian life in one particular relation，must come to the help of the mere feeling if the feeling is to be kept sweet."
"这样说并非要贬低自然之爱，而是要表明其真正的光芒所在。说一个花园不会自己围篱笆和锄萃，不会修剪自己的果树，不会自己修剪草坪，这绝不是对花园的轻蔑。花园是好东西但这不是它所拥有的那种美德。只有人对它做所有上面提到的那些事情，它才能保持花园的样子，与荒野有所区别。它真正的光辉是与众不同的。它需要不断除草和修剪，这个事实就见证了那种光芒。它充满了生命力。它光芒灿烂，带着天堂的气味，每个小时都会散发出夏日的美丽，这是人决不可能创造的，甚至是不能在他们自身心智的基础上，想象出来的。如果你想要看清花园和园丁的贡献之间的区别，就把花园里最普通的草放在锄头、靶子、剪刀、除草剂旁边也就相当于你已经把美丽、活力、和丰饶放到了没有生命的、呆板的东西旁边了。正是如此，我们的""礼貌和常识""在爱的温柔旁边显得灰暗和毫无生机。这个花园正值繁盛时，园丁对此的贡献与自然所做的贡献相比，从某种意义上讲仍然是微不足道的。没有从土地上长出的生命，没有从天而降的雨水、光和热，园丁无能为力。他做所有这些事情，仅仅是在这里促进了某种力量和美丽的发展，在那里却阻拦了某种力量和美丽的发展，这些力量和美丽是不同性质的。但是他的那部分努力，虽然很小，却是不可或缺的并且是艰苦的。当上帝创造出一个花园，他派人去管理，并且让那个人服从于他。当上帝在我们的天性花园中播种，并使能够开花结果的爱在那里成长，他派我们的意志力去""装扮""它们。与这些爱相比，我们的意志既枯燥又冷漠，除非上帝的美德像雨水和阳光一样降临，否则意志就达不到目的。但是它勤勉的一一很大程度上负面的一一服务是不可或缺的。如果花园仍像天堂时，还需要这些服务，那么现在当土壤已经变酸而且最坏的杂草看似要在那里茂盛生长时，又得需多少额外的努力啊?但是天堂禁止我们以道学先生和禁欲者的态度来工作。我们修修剪剪时，十分清楚我们正在修剪的东西充满光辉和活力，这是我们的理性意志本身永远不能提供的。释放那种光辉，让它充分变成它想变成的样子，让花园长满参天大树而不是盘根错节的矮藤，让它结满美味的苹果而不是渺果，是我们目的的一部分。","To say this is not to belittle the natural loves but to indicate where their real glory lies. It is no disparagement to a garden to say that it will not fence and weed itself，nor prune its own fruit trees，nor roll and cut its own lawns. A garden is a good thing but that is not the sort of goodness it has. It will remain a garden，as distinct from a wilderness，only if someone does all these things to it. Its real glory is of quite a different kind. The very fact that it needs constant weeding and pruning bears witness to that glory. It teems with life. It glows with colour and smells like heaven and puts forward at every hour of a summer day beauties which man could never have created and could not even，on his own resources，have imagined. If you want to see the difference between its contribution and the gardener's， put the commonest weed it grows side by side with his hoes，rakes，shears， and packet of weed killer; you have put beauty，energy and fecundity beside dead，sterile things. Just so，our ""decency and common sense"" show grey and deathlike beside the geniality of love. And when the garden is in its full glory the gardener's contributions to that glory will still have been in a sense paltry compared with those of nature. Without life springing from the earth, without rain，light and heat descending from the sky，he could do nothing. When he has done all，he has merely encouraged here and discouraged there，powers and beauties that have a different source. But his share，though small，is indispensable and laborious. When God planted a garden He set a man over it and set the man under Himself. When He planted the garden of our nature and caused the f1owering, fruiting loves to grow there，He set our will to ""dress"" them. Compared with them it is dry and cold. And unless His grace comes down，like the rain and the sunshine，we shall use this tool to little purpose. But its laborious-and largely negative — services are indispensable. If they were needed when the garden was still Paradisal，how much more now when the soil has gone sour and the worst weeds seem to thrive on it best? But heaven forbid we should work in the spirit of prigs and Stoics. While we hack and prune we know very well that what we are hacking and pruning is big with a splendour and vitality which our rational will could never of itself have supplied. To liberate that splendour，to let it become fully what it is trying to be，to have tall trees instead of scrubby tangles，and sweet apples instead of crabs，is part of our purpose."
"但是仅仅是一部分而已。因为现在我们必须面对一个我一直推迟讨论的话题。到目前为止，在这本书里几乎没有把我们的自然之爱当作上帝之爱的对手来谈。现在这个问题不能再避而不谈了。我把它推迟到现在有两个原因。","But only part. For now we must face a topic that I have long postponed. Hitherto hardly anything has been said in this book about our natural loves as rivals to the love of God. Now the question can no longer be avoided.There were two reasons for my delay."
"一个原因是一一我已经暗示出来了一一我们大多数人不需要从这个问题入手。一开始，它就很少""切合我们的处境""。对于我们大多数人而言，真正的对手存在于自我和他者之间，而不是存在于他者和上帝之间。当一个人真正的困难在于其尘世之爱尚且不够，把题越尘世之爱的责任强加到他身上，是很危险的。较少地爱我们的同类还幻想这是因为我们正学着去更多地爱上帝，毫无疑问这是非常容易的，但真正的原因可能完全不是这样。我们或许仅仅把""人类本性的衰退错当成了美德的增加""。许多人并不觉得憎恨他们自己的妻子或母亲真的那么难。在一幕杰出的或剧场景中，莫里亚克描绘了其他门徒对上帝这个奇怪的诫命感到惊讶和迷惑，但犹大没有。他欣然接受了。","One — already hinted — is that this question is not the place at which most of us need begin. It is seldom，at the outset，""addressed to our condition."" For most of us the true rivalry lies between the self and the human Other，not yet between the human Other and God. It is dangerous to press upon a man the duty of getting beyond earthly love when his real difficulty lies in getting so far. And it is no doubt easy enough to love the fellow-creature less and to imagine that this is happening because we are learning to love God more，when the real reason may be quite different. We may be only ""mistaking the decays of nature for the increase of Grace."" Many people do not find it really difficult to hate their wives or mothers. M. Mauriac，in a fine scene，pictures the other disciples stunned and bewildered by this strange command，but not Judas. He laps it up easily."
"但是从另一个方面讲，如果这本书较早地强调这种敌对关系也将会是草率的。轻率地宣称我们的爱具备神性，这种说法无需我们如此深刻地讨论也会被驳倒。这些爱证明它们是不配去取代上帝的，因为事实是，没有上帝的帮助，它们甚至不能保持自身，或完成它们所承诺的事情。一个没有了皇帝的支持，甚至无法保全自己较低一等的王位，连小省半年的和平都维持不了的小王子，我们有何必要去证明他不是合法的皇帝呢?即使为了它们自己的缘故，如果想要继续保持它们想要保持的特性，这些爱必须屈从于次耍的地位。它们真实的自由存在于这种束缚中，它们""鞠躬时会更高大""。因为当上帝在人的心里占统治地位时，尽管有时不得不完全去除一些他本有的权威，但是他经常继续在这些地方保持他其他的权威，而且，通过让它们的权威屈服于自己的权威，上帝第一次赋予它一个坚实的基础。爱默生说过：""半神半人消失了以后，神灵就到了。""这是一个非常令人怀疑的格言。更好的说法是""当上帝来临(而且只有那时)，半神半人才能够继续存在气让他们自己决定，他们要么消失，要么变成魔鬼。只有以上帝之名，他们才能够带着美好和安全 ""挥舞他们小小的三叉输""。反叛性的标语""一切为了蛋""事实上却是爱的死亡令(只是处死的日期暂时还未确定)。","But to have stressed the rivalry earlier in this book would have been premature in another way also. The claim to divinity which our loves so easily make can be refuted without going so far as that. The loves prove that they are unworthy to take the place of God by the fact that they cannot even remain themselves and do what they promise to do without God's help. Why prove that some petty princeling is not the lawful Emperor when without the Emperor's support he cannot even keep his subordinate throne and make peace in his little province for half a year? Even for their own sakes the loves must submit to be second things if they are to remain the things they want to be. In this yoke lies their true freedom; they""are taller when they bow."" For when God rules in a human heart，though He may sometimes have to remove certain of its native authorities altogether，He often continues others in their offices and，by subjecting their authority to His，gives it for the first time a firm basis. Emerson has said，""When half-gods go，the gods arrive."" That is a very doubtful maxim. Better say，""When God arrives (and only then) the half-gods can remain."" Left to themselves they either vanish or become demons. Only in His name can they with beauty and security ""wield their little tridents."" The rebellious slogan ""All for love"" is really love's death warrant (date of execution，for the moment，left blank)."
"竞争的问题，由于以上原因而拖延了这么久，现在必须加以探讨。在以往任何时期，除了十九世纪，关于爱的书自始至终都突出竞争这一主题。如果维多利亚时代的人需要有人提醒说爱是不够的，那么更老的神学家总是太声地说(自然的)曼可能太多了。对我们同伴的爱太少了这一危险相比于像崇拜偶像一样爱他们的危险，他们考虑更多的是后者。在每个妻子、母亲、孩子和朋友身上，他们看到了上帝的可能的对手。当然我们的上帝也看到了:（《路加福音》，10：26）","But the question of the rivalry，for these reasons long postponed，must now be treated. In any earlier period，except the nineteenth century，it would have loomed large throughout a book on this subject. If the Victorians needed the reminder that love is not enough，older theologians were always saying very loudly that (natural) love is likely to be a great deal too much. The danger of loving our fellow-creatures too little was less present to their minds than that of loving them idolatrously. In every wife，mother，child and friend they saw a possible rival to God. So of course does Our Lord (Luke XIV，26)."
"有一种方法来阻止我们对同伴过度的爱，但我发现自己不得不一开始就拒绝它。我这样做时有些不安，因为我是在一个伟大的圣人和思想家的著作中看到这种方法的，从他的著作中我受益良多。","There is one method of dissuading us from inordinate love of the fellow-creature which I find myself forced to reject at the very outset. I do so with trembling，for it met me in the pages of a great saint and a great thinker to whom my own glad debts are incalculable."
"圣奥古斯丁描述他的朋友内布利提乌斯的死带给他的那种忧伤时，所用的语言至今仍会令人泪下。(《忏悔录》，4: 10)。接着，他总结出了一个寓意。他说，这是由于把自己的心献给上帝以外的任何东西所带来的后果。所有人都会死。不要让你的幸福建立在你可能会失去的东西之上。如果爱要成为一种祝福，而不是一种痛苦，那么它必须献给唯一永远都不会死去的上帝。","In words which can still bring tears to the eyes，St. Augustine describes the desolation in which the death of his friend Nebridius plunged him (Confessions Ⅳ，10). Then he draws a moral. This is what comes，he says，of giving one's heart to anything but God. All human beings pass away. Do not let your happiness depend on something you may lose. If love is to be a blessing，not a misery，it must be for the only Beloved who will never pass away."
"当然，这非常明智。不要把你的货物放在漏水的船里。不要为你可能会被撵出去的房子花费过多。活着的人中，没有谁比我对这种谨慎的格言反应更自然了。我是信奉安全第一的人。在所有反对爱的论调中，没有比""当心!这会使你受罪""更能吸引我的本性。","Of course this is excellent sense. Don't put your goods in a leaky vessel. Don't spend too much on a house you may be turned out of. And there is no man alive who responds more naturally than 1 to such canny maxims. 1 am a safety-first creature. Of all arguments against love none makes so strong an appeal to my nature as ""Careful! This might lead you to suffering."""
"对于我的本性、脾气来说，是这样的。但对我的良知来说，不是这样的。我对那种吸引力做出反应时，似乎在自己看来离基督有万里之遥。如果我可以肯定什么事情的话，我敢肯定基督的教导决不会肯定我对安全的投入和有限的束缚天生的偏爱。我怀疑在我身上是否存在一种更让他不高兴的东西。有谁能够出于谨慎一一因为安全性(可以这样说)更高一一令人信服地开始去爱上帝呢?谁能够把它包含在爱的缘由里呢？你会以这样的态度选择妻子或朋友(乃至一条狗)吗?在这样估量之前，这个人一定要在爱的世界之外，一切爱的世界之外。情爱，无约束的情爱，比起幸福来说更加偏爱所爱的人，它要比这个更像上帝之爱本身。","To my nature，my temperament，yes. Not to my conscience. When I respond to that appeal 1 seem to myself to be a thousand miles away from Christ. If I am sure of anything 1 am sure that His teaching was never meant to confirm my congenital preference for safe investments and limited liabilities. I doubt whether there is anything in me that pleases Him less. And who could conceivably begin to love God on such a prudential ground-because the security (so to speak is better? Who could even include it among the grounds for loving? Would you choose a wife or a Friend-if it comes to that，would you choose a dog-in this spirit? One must be outside the world of love，of all loves， before one thus calculates. Eros，lawless Eros，preferring the Beloved to happiness，is more like Love himself than this. "
"我认为《忏悔录》中的这一段与其说是圣奥古斯丁的基督教世界，还不如说是他成长时周围高尚的异教哲学氛围的战留物。相对于仁爱来说，它更接近斯多葛学派的""冷漠""或者新柏拉图派的神秘论。我们追随上帝，他为耶路撒冷哭泣，在拉撒路的坟墓前哭泣，他爱众生，不过只从某种特别的意义上他""爱过'一个门徒。对我们来说，圣保罗要比圣奥古斯丁更有权威一一如果巴弗提死去的话，圣保罗没有表示出任何迹象他不应像常人一样感到痛苦，也未流露出任何他不应这样痛苦的感情(《排利门书》，2:27).","I think that this passage in the Confessions is less a part of St. Augustine's Christendom than a hangover from the high-minded Pagan philosophies in which he grew up. It is closer to Stoic ""apathy"" or neo-Platonic mysticism than to charity. We follow One who wept over Jerusalem and at the grave of Lazarus，and，loving all，yet had one disciple whom，in a special sense，he ""loved."" St. Paul has a higher authority with us than St. Augustine-St. Paul who shows no sign that he would not have suffered like a man，and no feeling that he ought not so to have suffered，if Epaphroditus had died(Philem II，27)."
"即使同意预防悲伤是我们最高的智慧，上帝是否会提供这些措施呢?很明显没有。基督最后说道:""为什么离弃我?""","Even if it were granted that insurances against heartbreak were our highest wisdom，does God Himself offer them? Apparently not. Christ comes at last to say ""Why hast thou forsaken me?"""
"圣奥古斯丁所暗示的路线不存在出路。其他路线也不存在。不存在安全的投资。去量，从根本上就是去变得易受伤害。爱一样东西，你的心肯定会受折磨，或许会心碎。如果想要确保心的完整，你不得把自己的心给任何人，甚至是动物。小心地用自己的兴趣和小奢侈把它裹起来；避免所有的纠缠；把它安全地锁在自私的骨灰盒或者棺材里。但是在那个安全的、黑暗的、静止的、也没有空气的一一盒子里它也会发生变化。它不会被破坏，它会变得牢不可破，不可穿透，无可救药。悲剧的替代物，或者至少是对悲剧这一风险的替代物，是被罚下地狱。在天堂外你能够完全脱离爱的所有危险和烦恼的唯一地方就是地狱。","There is no escape along the lines St. Augustine suggests. Nor along any other lines. There is no safe investment. To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything，and your heart will certainly be wrung and possibly be broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact ，you must give your heart to no one，not even to an animal.Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements; lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket safe，dark，motionless，airless-it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable，impenetrable，irredeemable. The alternative to tragedy，or at least to the risk of tragedy，is damnation. The only place outside Heaven where you can be perfectly safe from all the dangers and perturbations of love is Hell. "
"我相信最没有约束的，最放纵的爱耍比自己引起的、自我保护的无爱状态更少地与上帝的意志相对抗。这就像是埋没才能，而且大体上是出于相同的原因。""我知道你是狠心的人。""基督没有教导也不允许我们变得一一即使是在自然爱中一一对自己的幸福更加重视。如果一个人无法对他见过的尘世的爱人毫无算计，那么他更不可能这样对待他没有见过的上帝.我们将拉近与上帝的距离，不是通过试图避免所有爱中固有的苦难，而是通过接受它们并把它们献给上帝;丢弃所有防御的盔甲。如果需要街我们的心，并且如果上帝选择这样作为使我们伤心的方式，那么就这样吧。","I believe that the most lawless and inordinate loves are less contrary to God's will than a self-invited and self-protective lovelessness. It is like hiding the talent in a napkin and for much the same reason. ""I knew thee that thou wert a hard man."" Christ did not teach and suffer that we might become，even in the natural loves，more careful of our own happiness.If a man is not uncalculating towards the earthly beloveds whom he has seen，he is none the more likely to be so towards God whom he has not. We shall draw nearer to God，not by trying to avoid the sufferings inherent in all loves，but by accepting them and offering them to Him; throwing away all defensive armour. If our hearts need to be broken，and if He chooses this as the way in which they should break，so be it."
"肯定正确的是，所有自然的爱都可能是*过度的*。*过度的*不是指""不够小心""，也不是指""太大。""它不是数量词。爱任何人或许都不可能""太多了。""与我们对上帝的爱*相比*我们或许爱他太多了，但正是我们对上帝的爱的渺小，而不是我们对人的爱的伟大，才构成了这种过度的特性。但是即使这样，我们还需要进一步解释。否则我们会给已经在正确的道路上而又对此有所怀疑的人带来麻烦，因为他们无法感觉到对上帝像对尘世的爱人那样的一种明显热烈的感情。人们十分期待一一至少我这样认为一一我们所有人，一直以来能够对上帝怀有热烈的情感。我们必须祈祷，祈求上帝的恩赐。但是我们是爱上帝更多还是爱尘世的爱人更多，就我们基督徒的责任而盲，这个问题不是一个比较两种情感强度的问题.真正的问题是你为哪个(当替换的选择出现时)服务，或者选择哪个，或者把谁放在第一位?你的意愿归根结底会屈服于哪个命令呢?","It remains certainly true that all natural loves can be inordinate. *Inordinate* does not mean ""insufficiently cautious."" Nor does it mean ""too big."" It is not a quantitative term. It is probably impossible to love any human being simply ""too much."" We may love him too much *in proportion* to our love for God; but it is the smallness of our love for God，not the greatness of our love for man，that constitutes the inordinacy. But even this must be refined upon. Otherwise we shall trouble some who are very much on the right road but alarmed because they cannot feel towards God so warm a sensible emotion as they feel for the earthly Beloved. It is much to be wished — at least I think so-that we all，at all times，could. We must pray that this gift should be given us. But the question whether we are loving God or the earthly Beloved ""more""is not，so far as concerns our Christian duty，a question about the comparative intensity of two feelings. The real question is，which (when the alternative comes) do you serve，or choose，or put first? To which claim does your will，in the last resort，yield?"
"正如经常发生的情形，基督自己的话语要比神学家的话更加尖锐但却更加可以忍受。他没有说任何关于提防尘世之爱的话，以免我们可能受到伤害，当世俗的爱阻止我们跟随他时，他说了一些把他们全部踩在脚底下的话，这些话掷地有声.""人到我这里来，若不爱我胜过爱自己的父母、妻子……和自己生命，就不能成为我的门徒。""(《路加福音》，14: 26)","As so often，Our Lord's own words are both far fiercer and far more tolerable than those of the theologians. He says nothing about guarding against earthly loves for fear we might be hurt; He says something that cracks like a whip about trampling them all under foot the moment they hold us back from following Him. ""If any man come to me and hate not his father and mother and wife... and his own life also，he cannot be my disciple"" (Luke XIV，26)."
"但是我们该如何理解*恨*这个词呢？上帝之爱竟然命令我们做通常用恨来表达的事一一命令我们珍爱憎恨的感情，嘲笑其他人的苦难，为伤害他而感到高兴一一这几乎是一种明确的矛盾。我认为基督说""退到我后边去吧""时，从这里所暗含的意义上讲，他""恨""圣彼特。恨一个人就是当所爱的人，不管多么甜蜜、多么可怜地说出恶魔般的建议时，要拒绝，要坚决反对，不做任何让步。耶稣说，一个人要想服务于两个主人，将会""恨""其中一个而""爱""另一个。可以肯定地说，这垦谈论的不仅是憎恨和喜欢的情感。他会忠于、赞成、效力于其中一个而不顾另一个。再考虑一下这句话，""我爱雅各布，我*恨*以扫""(《玛拉基书》，1:2-3)。被称为上帝对以扫的*恨*是如何表现在真实的故事中的呢?一点儿都不像我们可能预料的那样。当然没有任何理由假定以扫没有好的结局，并且成了一个迷失的灵魂；《圣经·旧约》关于这一点和其他地方一样，对于这些事情都没有解释。而且就我们所知，以扫的尘世生活，从每一个普通意义上讲，都远远比雅各布的生活受到更多的祝福。正是雅各布有着一切的失望、羞耻、恐惧和丧亲之痛.但他也拥有以扫所没有的一些东西。他是元老。他将希伯来人的传统延续下来，传递上帝的使命和祝福，成为基督的先辈。对雅各布的""爱""似乎意味着为了更高的使命而接受雅各布，对以扫的""恨""，是对他的拒绝。他被""拒绝""，没有""达到需要的标准""，他在达到目的上被认为是无用的。所以最终我们必须拒绝我们最亲近的人或者取消他们的资格，一旦他们夹在我们和我们对上帝的顺从之间时。天知道，这在他们看来完全就像是恨。我们不能按照我们感觉到的怜悯行事，我们必须对眼泪视而不见，对恳求充耳不闻。","But how are we to understand the word *hate*? That Love Himself should be commanding what we ordinarily mean by hatred-commanding us to cherish resentmen, to gloat over another's misery, to delight in injuring him — is almost a contradiction in terms. I think Our Lord，in the sense here intended，""hated"" St. Peter when he said，""Get thee behind me."" To hate is to reject，to set one's face against，to make no concession to, the Beloved when the Beloved utters，however sweetly and however pitiably，the suggestions of the Devil. A man，said Jesus，who tries to serve two masters，will ""hate"" the one and ""love"" the other. It is not，surely，mere feelings of aversion and liking that are here in question. He will adhere to，consent to，work for，the one and not for the other. Consider again，""I loved Jacob and I *hated* Esau""(Malachi I，2-3). How is the thing called God's ""hatred"" of Esau displayed in the actual story? Not at all as we might expect. There is of course no ground for assuming that Esau made a bad end and was a lost soul; the Old Testament，here as elsewhere，has nothing to say about such matters. And，from all we are told，Esau's earthly life was，in every ordinary sense，a good deal more blessed than Jacob's. It is Jacob who has all the disappointments，humiliations，terrors，and bereavements. But he has something which Esau has not. He is a patriarch. He hands on the Hebraic tradition，transmits the vocation and the blessing，becomes an ancestor of Our Lord. The ""loving"" of Jacob seems to mean the acceptance of Jacob for a high (and painful) vocation; the ""hating"" of Esau，his rejection. He is ""turned down""，fails to ""make the grade，""is found useless for the purpose. So，in the last resort, we must turn down or disqualify our nearest and dearest when they come between us and our obedience to God. Heaven knows，it will seem to them sufficiently like hatred. We must not act on the pity we feel;we must be blind to tears and deaf to pleadings."
"我不会说做到以上这点很难，有些人感觉太简单了，有些人却感觉难得几乎超出了他们的承受力。对所有人都难的事情是要知道什么时候是这种""恨'的时机，出现了。我们的性情会欺骗我们。谦恭和温柔的人一一宠爱妻子的丈夫、顺从的妻子、宠爱孩子的父母、孝顺父母的孩子一一将不会轻易相信恨的时刻到了。独断专行的人带着一种强势人的锐气，会过快酣脯它。这就是为什么将我们的爱置于一个恰当的位置，使恨根本不会出现，是极其重要的。","I will not say that this duty is hard; some find it too easy; some，hard almost beyond endurance. What is hard for all is to know when the occasion for such ""hating"" has arisen. Our temperaments deceive us. The meek and tender-uxorious husbands，submissive wives，doting parents，dutiful children-will not easily believe that it has ever arrived. Self-assertive people，with a dash of the bully in them，will believe it too soon. That is why it is of such extreme importance so to order our loves that it is unlikely to arrive at all. "
"在一个更低的层次上我们可以看到这是怎么发生的，保王党诗人即将参战时对他的情妇说：","How this could come about we may see on a far lower level when the Cavalier poet，going to the wars，says to his mistress: "
"亲爱的，倘若我不更爱荣誉 ","I could not love thee，dear，so much"
"我便不会如此爱你。","Loved I not honour more."
"有一些女人，这种辩解对她们来说毫无意义。*荣誉*可能仅仅是那些男人所谈论的愚蠢的事情之一罢了；是对违背""爱的法则""(这正是诗人要去做的)找到的一种口头上的借口，因而加重了他的错误。洛夫莱斯可以自倍地使用它，因为他的女人是一个保王党人，她已经像他一样认可了对荣誉的主张。他不需要""恨'她，不需要坚决反对她，因为他和她承认共同的法则。他们在这个问题上早已达成共识、互相理解。把她改变为荣誉的信徒这项工作不是现在一现在，他们面临抉择的时候一一要着手做的。当危及到一千比对荣誉的主张更加伟大的主张时，这种先前共识就更加必要了。危机来临时再告诉妻子或丈夫，母亲或朋友，你的爱一直有隐蔽的保留一一这种保留是""在上帝庇护下""或者""在更高的爱允许的范围内""，到那时就太晚了。他们早就应该受到警告，可以肯定的是，不是明确地而是通过千言万语中的暗示、通过对小事情的千百个决定中体现出来的原则而实现。的确，在这个问题上的真正的不一致应该尽早地让对方知道从而避免婚姻或友情的开始。不管哪一种最好的爱都不是盲目的。奥利弗·艾尔顿，在谈到卡莱尔和穆勒时，说他们对正义有不同的理解，还说这样一个分歧对""任何对得起友谊这个称呼的友谊""当然都是致命的。如果""一切""一一名副其实的一切一一""都是为了爱""而在被爱者的态度中是隐含的，那么他或她的爱就不值得拥有。它不是以一种正确的方式与上帝之爱联系起来的。","There are women to whom the plea would be meaningless. *Honour* would be just one of those silly things that Men talk about; a verbal excuse for， therefore an aggravation of，the offence against ""love's law"" which the poet is about to commit. Lovelace can use it with confidence because his lady is a Cavalier lady who already admits，as he does，the claims of Honour. He does not need to ""hate"" her, to set his face against her，for he and she acknowledge the same law. They have agreed and understood each other on this matter long before. The task of converting her to a belief in Honour is not now-now，when the decision is upon them-to be undertaken. It is this prior agreement which is so necessarγ when a far greater claim than that of Honour is at atake. It is too late，when the crisis comes，to begin telling a wife or husband or mother or friend，that your love all along had a secret reservation — ""under God"" or ""so far as a higher Love permits."" They ought to have been warned; not，to be sure，explicitly，but by the implication of a thousand talks，by the principle revealed in a hundred decisions upon small matters. Indeed，a real disagreement on this issue should make itself felt early enough to prevent a marriage or a Friendship from existing at all. The best love of either sort is not blind. Oliver Elton， speaking of Carlyle and Mill, said that they differed about justice，and that such a difference was naturally fatal ""to any friendship worthy of the name."" If""All"" — quite seriously all-""for love"" is implicit in the Beloved's attitude，his or her love is not worth having. It is not related in the right way to Love Himself."
"这把我带到了这本书必须要努力攀爬的最后一个陡峭的山坡的脚下。我们必须试着把被称为""爱""的人类活动与上帝的爱联系起来，而且要比我们以前做过的稍许更加准确。这种准确度，当然，只能是一种模式，或一个象征，从长久看肯定会使我们失望，即使我们使用它，也需要其他模式来修正它。我们中最谦逊的人，处于恩典之中，能够具有对上帝之爱的某种""由熟悉而得的认识""(相知)，某种""感悟""，但是即使人在最庄严、最聪明时，他也没有直接的、关于最终存在的""有关的知识"" (知道)一一知道的仅仅是类比而已。我们无法看到光，尽管通过光我们能看见东西。关于上帝的观点是从我们对其他事物的认识中推断的结果，对其他事物的认识是通过神的启发才得到的。我之所以详尽地阐释贬低对上帝的认识是因为，在接下来的部分里，我想要表达清楚的努力(而且不是令人无法忍受的冗长)，或许会暗示出一种我绝不会觉察到的信心。我应该是疯了，如果我有这种自信的话。你就把它当成是一个人的幻想，几乎是一个人的神话。如果其中的任何东西是对你们有用的，那就利用它吧，如果没有任何东西有用，那就决不要再考虑它了。","And this brings me to the foot of the last steep ascent this book must try to make. We must try to relate the human activities called ""loves"" to that Love which is God a little more precisely than we have yet done. The precision can，of course，be only that of a model or a symbol， certain to fail us in the long run and，even while we use it，requiring correction from other models. The humblest of us，in a state of Grace， can have some ""knowledge-by-acquaintance"" (conmaître)，some ""tasting""， of Love Himself; but man even at his highest sanctity and intelligence has no direct ""knowledge about"" (savoir) the ultimate Being-only analogies. We cannot see light ，though by light we can see things. Statements about God are extrapolations from the knowledge of other things which the divine illumination enables us to know. I labour these deprecations because，in what follows，my efforts to be clear (and not intolerably lengthy) may suggest a confidence which I by no means feel. I should be mad if I did. Take it as one man's reverie，almost one man's myth. If anything in it is useful to you，use it; if anything is not，never give it a second thought."
"上帝是爱。再者，""不是我们爱神，乃是神爱我们，这就是爱了""(《约翰一书》4:10)。我们决不能以神秘论开始，不能以万物对上帝的爱开始，也不能以有些人在他们的俗世生活中对上帝赐予的果实的美妙预尝开始。我们以爱作为神圣的力量来开始，这是真正的开端。这种原始的爱是赠予之爱。在上帝身上，没有饥饿需要填补，有的仅仅是渴望给予的丰饶。上帝没有必费创造教条，但它不仅仅是枯燥的学究的推测。它是必不可少的。没有它，我们就几乎不可能避开我只能称之为""管理的""上帝的概念，他的功能或本质是要""管理""宇宙，他对于宇宙，就像校长对于学校或者旅馆经营者对于旅馆一样。但是统治字窗对上帝来说不是什么大事。在上帝那里，在""三位一体的领地上""的家中，他是一个更大的领地的君主。我们必须永远在我们的眼前保持朱利安女士的幻象，在那幻境里，上帝手中拿着一个像是坚果的小东西，而那个坚果就是""被创造的一切""。上帝什么也不需要，却希望全部多余的东西存在，以便他可以爱并且完善它们。上帝创造了字窗，已经预见到一一或者我们应该说""看到""呢?在主帝那里没有时态一一在十字架周围的苍蝇发出嗡嗡的响声，剥去皮的背部紧贴在不平的木桩上，钉子穿过中枢神经，身体下垂时反复出现的初始的窒息，背上和手臂上的痛苦一再重复，因为为了呼吸要不停起身。如果我可以用生物学的形象打比方，我想说，上帝是故意创造出他自己的寄生虫的""主人""；他让我们成为这样的：我们可以利用他并""从他处获利""。这就是爱。这就是上帝之爱的图解，他是所有爱的创造者。","God is love. Again，""Herein is love，not that we loved God but that He loved us"" (I *John* IV，10) . We must not begin with mysticism，with the creature's love for  God，or with the wonderful foretastes of the fruition of God vouchsafed to some in their earthly life. We begin at the real beginning，with love as the Divine energy. This primal love is Gift-love. In God there is no hunger that needs to be filled，only plenteousness that desires to give. The doctrine that God was under no necessity to create is not a piece of dry scholastic speculation. It is essential. Without it we can hardly avoid the conception of what I can only call a ""managerial""God; a Being whose function or nature is to ""run"" the universe，who stands to it as a head-master to a school or a hotelier to a hotel. But to be sovereign of the universe is no great matter to God. In Himself，at home in ""the land of the Trinity""，he is Sovereign of a far greater realm. We must keep  always before our eyes that vision of Lady Julian's in which God carried in His hand a little object like a nut，and that nut was ""all that is made."" God，who needs nothing，loves into existence wholly superfluous creatures in order that He may love and perfect them. He creatures the universe，already foreseeing — or should we say ""seeing""? there are no tenses in God-the buzzing cloud of flies about the cross, the flayed back pressed against the uneven stake，the nails driven through the mesial nerves，the repeated incipient suffocation as the body droops，the repeated torture of back and arms as it is time after time，for breath's sake，hitched up. If I may dare the biological image，God is a ""host"" who deliberately creates His own parasites; causes us to be that we may exploit and ""take advantage of"" Him. Herein is love. This is the diagram of Love Himself，the inventor of all loves."
"上帝，作为我们天性的创造者，在我们身上灌输了赠予之爱和需求之爱。赠予之爱是上帝自身天生的形象；是通过相似性而获得向上帝的接近，这些相似性不一定必然在所有人中都是趋向上帝的接近。全心付出的母亲，仁蓝的统治者或者老师，可以不断地给予，不断地展示出与上帝的相似性，然而却没有在趋向上接近上帝。需求之爱，就我能够看到的，与上帝所代表的爱没有一点相似之处。他们是相互关联、相互对立的；当然，不是像邪恶是善良的对立物那样，而是像牛奶冻的形状是模具渺陡的对立物一样。","God，as Creator of nature，implants in us both Gift-loves and Need­-loves. The Gift-loves are natural images of Himse1f; proximities to Him by resemblance which are not necessarily and in all men proximities of approach. A devoted mother，a beneficent ruler or teacher，may give and give，continually exhibiting the likeness，without making the approach. The Need-loves ，so far as 1 have been able to see，have no resemblance to the Love which God is. They are rather correlatives，opposites; not as evil is the opposite of good，of course，but as the form of the blancmange is an opposite to the form of the mould."
"但是除了这些自然的爱之外，上帝能够赠予一份更好的礼物；确切地说，由于我们的思想必须要分开和归类，那么就可以说是两个礼物。","But in addition to these natural loves God can bestow a far better gift; or rather，since our minds must divide and pigeon-hole，two gifts. "
"上帝给人一份自己的赠予之爱。这与上帝早已根植于人的本性中的赠予之爱是不同的。这些本性中的赠予之爱绝不会仅仅为了对象自身的利益而为被量对象谋求好处。他们倾向于他们自己能够给予的好处，或者是那些他们自己最想要的好处，或者偏爱那些其生活符合他们的预先规划的被爱对象。但神圣的赠予之爱一一在人身上起作用的上帝之爱一一对这些完全不感兴趣，它只渴望那些对所爱之物最有用的东西。再者，自然的赠予之爱永远是关注一些物体，喜欢的人觉得这些物体从某种方式上讲本身就非常可爱一一那些物体吸引他的地方是慈爱、情爱或一个共同的看法，或者如果这些地方不吸引他，就会吸引感恩的人和应受奖赏的人，或许还会吸引到那些无助的人，他们引人注意，赢得同情。但是在人身上的上帝的赠予之爱可以让他爱本来不可爱的人:麻风病人、罪犯、敌人、蠢人、坏脾气的人、自命不凡的人、嘲笑别人的人。最后，通过复杂的自相矛盾，上帝使得人拥有一种对上帝的赠予之爱。当然，认为没有人可以给上帝任何不是主帝已经有了的东西是有一定道理的，而如果它早已是上帝的，那么你给了他什么呢?但是既然我们已经很明显能够从上帝那里保留我们自己，保留我们的意志和心灵，从那种意义上讲，我们也能够献出这些。原本属于上帝的东西，如果不再属于他，就不会再存在(就像歌曲是属于歌唱家的)。虽然如此，上帝也已经通过这样一个方式创造了我们的东西，以至于我们能够自由地把它献回给上帝。""为了使他们成为你的，我们的意志是我们的。""正如所有的基督徒都知道的，仍有另一种献给上帝的方式F我们给饭吃或者给衣服穿的每个陌生人都是基督。很明显的，无论我们知道与否，这就是对上帝的赠予之爱.上帝之爱能够在那些对上帝一无所知的人们身上起作用。在寓言中的""绵羊""，对隐藏在那些他们曾访问过的囚犯中的上帝或者对他们访问时隐藏在他们自身当中的上帝都一无所知。(我把整个寓言当作是对异教徒的审判。因为在希腊语中它开始说的是，上帝将会召集""万民""来到他的面前一一大概是那些异邦人，即那些*外邦人*。)","He communicates to men a share of His own Gift-love. This is different from the Gift-loves He has built into their nature. These never quite seek simply the good of the loved object for the object's own sake. They are biased in favour of those goods they can themselves bestow， or those which they would like best themselves，or those which fit in with a pre-conceived picture of the life they want the object to lead. But Divine Gift-love-Love Himself working in a man-is wholly disinterested and desires what is simply best for the beloved. Again， natural Gift-love is always directed to objects which the lover finds in some way intrinsically lovable-objects to which Affection or Eros or a shared point of view attracts him，or，failing that，to the grateful and the deserving，or perhaps to those whose helplessness is of a winning and appealing kind. But Divine Gift-love in the man enables him to love what is not naturally lovable; lepers，criminals，enemies，morons， the sulky，the superior and the sneering. Finally，by a high paradox，God enables men to have a Gift-love towards Himself. There is of course a sense in which no one can give to God anything which is not already His; and if it is already His what have you given? But since it is only too obvious that we can withhold ourselves，our wills and hearts，from God，we can，in that sense，also give them. What is His by right and would not exist for a moment if it ceased to be His (as the song is the singer's)，He has nevertheless made ours in such a way that we can freely offer it back to Him. ""Our wills are ours to make them Thine."" And as all Christians know there is another way of giving to God; every stranger whom we feed or clothe is Christ. And this apparently is Gift-love to God whether we know it or not. Love Himself can work in those who know nothing of Him. The ""sheep"" in the parable had no idea either of the God hidden in the prisoner whom they visited or of the God hidden in themselves when they made the visit. (I take the whole parable to be about the judgment of the heathen. For it begins by saying，in the Greek，that the Lord will summon all ""the nations"" before Him-presumably，the Gentiles，the *Goyim*.)"
"每个人都会同意，这种来自上帝恩典的赠予之爱应该被称作仁爱。但是我不得不加些东西，这些东西或许不会如此简单地得到认可。在我看来上帝给予了两份其他的礼物，一种是对上帝的超自然的需求之爱，另一种是对彼此的超自然的需求之爱。谈到第一种需求之爱，我不是指对上帝的欣赏之爱，即崇拜的礼物。对那个更高级的(实际上是最高级的)话题，我要说的非常少，将会在后面展开。我指的是这样一种爱，它不会梦想公正无私，那不过是无尽的贫穷.就像一条小河自己开凿了河道，就像一杯魔幻的酒，当被倒出来时，它同时创造了那个要盛洒的玻璃杯，上帝把我们对他的需要转化成了对他的需求之爱。更加奇怪的是上帝赋予我们一种超乎自然的对来自同伴的仁爱的接纳能力。需求是如此的接近贪婪而且我们已经如此贪婪以至于贪婪似乎是一种奇怪的美德。但是我不能从我脑海里去除这种想法:这就是所发生的事情。","That such a Gift-love comes by Grace and should be called Charity，everyone will agree. But I have to add something which will not perhaps be so easily admitted. God，as it seems to me，bestows two other gifts; a supernatural Need-love of Himself and a supernatural Need-love of one another. By the first I do not mean the Appreciative love of Himself，the gift of adoration. What little I have to say on that higher-that highest-subject will come later. I mean a love which does not dream of disinterestedness，a bottomless indigence. Like a river making its own channel，like a magic wine which in being poured out should simultaneously create the glass that was to hold it，God turns our need of Him into Need-love of Him. What is stranger still is that He creates in us a more than natural receptivity of Charity from our fellow-men. Need is so near greed and we are so greedy already that it seems a strange grace. But I cannot get it out of my head that this is what happens."
"让我们首先考虑这种上帝恩典赐予的这种超自然的需求之爱。当然恩典本身不会创造需求。需求已经在那里了；这由于我们是受造物的这一现实而成为""已知"" (正如数学家所言)的，也因为我们是堕落的受造物而无限地增加。恩典所给予的，是对这种需求的完全的承认、理智的认识、彻底的接受一一即使，带着某种保留，也是高兴的接受。因为没有了恩典，我们的愿望和需要是冲突的。","Let us consider first this supernatural Need-love of Himself，bestowed by Grace. Of course the Grace does not create the need. That is there already; ""given""(as the mathematicians say) in the mere fact of our being creatures，and incalculably increased by our being fallen creatures. What the Grace gives is the full recognition，the sensible awareness，the complete acceptance-even，with certain reservations， the glad acceptance-of this Need. For，without Grace，our wishes and our necessities are in conflict."
"基督徒在实践中所说一切表示自己不配的话，在外界看来就像一个馅媚者在暴君面前堕落的、虚假的卑躬屈膝一样，或者至多可以这么说，就像一个中国绅士在说自己""在下孤陋寡闻""时的自我贬低一样。然而事实上，他们表达出了持续更新的努力，因为持续是有必要的，他们试图打消对我们自己和对我们和上帝的关系的误解，即使当我们析祷时，本性也一直向我们灌输这些误解。一旦我们相信上帝爱我们，我们就会有一种冲动认为他是爱我们的，不是因为他是爱而是因为我们本来就是可爱的。异教徒不加掩饰地服从这种冲动，""众神很青睐'一个好人是因为他是好人。受过较好教育的我们，就会寻求托词。我们决不会认为我们拥有美德，而它们是上帝爱我们的原因。但是这样的话，我们是多么彻底地忏悔啊!正如班扬描绘他第一次假意阪依时所说：""我曾以为在英格兰没有人比我更能让上帝开心。""搞清这种看法，为了得到上帝的欣赏，我们下一步会献上自己的谦卑。上帝一定会喜欢*那样*吗?或者如果喜欢的不是那样，就是我们聪明而且谦逊地承认我们仍然缺少谦卑。因此，一层更比一层深，微妙、中带着微妙，那里保留着一些对我们自己的、真正我们自己的经久不消的吸引力的想法。很容易承认，但几乎不可能长久地意识到的是，我们只是镜子，如果我们是明亮的，那我们的亮度则完全来自映照着我们的太阳。我们必定拥有很少一一尽管很少一一与生俱来的光辉吧?恐怕我们肯定不能*完全*的是那种受造物吧?","All those expressions of unworthiness which Christian practice puts into the believer's mouth seem to the outer world like the degraded and insincere grovellings of a sycophant before a tyrant，or at best a *façon de parler* like the self-depreciation of a Chinese gentleman when he calls himself ""this coarse and illiterate person.""In reality，however, they express the continually renewed，because continually renewed, because continually necessary, attempt to negate that misconception of ourselves and of our relation to God which nature，even while we pray，is always recommending to us. No sooner do we believe that God loves us than there is an impulse to believe that He does so，not because He is Love，but because we are intrinsically lovable. The Pagans obeyed this impulse unabashed; a good man was ""dear to the gods"" because he was good. We，being better taught，resort to subterfuge. Far be it from us to think that we have virtues for which God could love us. But then，how magnificently we have repented! As Bunyan says，describing his first and illusory conversion，""I thought there was no man in England that pleased God better than I."" Beaten out of this，we next offer our own humility to God's admiration. Surely He'll like *that*? Or if not that，our clear-sighted and humble recognition that we still lack humility. Thus，depth beneath depth and subtlety within subtlety，there remains some lingering idea of our own，our very own，attractiveness. It is easy to acknowledge，but almost impossible to realise for long，that we are mirrors whose brightness，if we are bright，is wholly derived from the sun that shines upon us. Surely we must have a little-however little--native luminosity? Surely we can't be *quite* creatures?"
"上帝的恩典使我们像孩童一般，愉悦地接受了自己的需求，为自己完全依靠上帝而欣喜，从而摆脱了那种混乱的、荒谬的、从不彻底承认自己匮乏的需求，甚至是需求之爱。我们变成了""快乐的乞丐气好人对使他的需求增加的罪恶感到愧疚。他对罪恶所产生的新的需求并不完全感到愧疚。而且他对受造物的条件下所固有的那种无窑的需求没有一点的愧疚。因为一直以来，这种自然依附于其上并将其作为最后的财富的幻觉，这种我们有属于我们自己的任何东西或者用我们自己的力量一时地保留上帝可能灌输到我们身上的任何善良的伪装，已经使我们不快乐。我们像是游泳的人，他们需要把两只脚一一或者一只一一或者一个脚趾头一一放在底部，如果失去了那个支撑点，就意味着他们不得不在海浪中糟糕地跌倒。与我们最后的对本来的自由、力量或价值的主张决裂所带来的结果是真正的自由、力量和价值，真正属于我们的，因为上帝将它们赐予了我们，并且因为我们知道它们不是(在另一种意义上)""我们的""。阿诺道斯已经摆脱了他的影子。","For this tangled absurdity of a Need，even a Need-love，which never fully acknowledges its own neediness，Grace substitutes a full，childlike and delighted acceptance of our Need，a joy in total dependence. We become ""jolly beggars."" The good man is sorry for the sins which have increased his Need. He is not entirely sorry for the fresh Need they have produced. And he is not sorry at all for the innocent Need that is inherent in his creaturely condition. For all the time this illusion to which nature clings as her last treasure，this pretence that we have anything of our own or could for one hour retain by our own strength any goodness that God may pour into us，has kept us from being happy. We have been like bathers who want to keep their feet-or one foot-or one toe-on the bottom，when to lose that foothold would be to surrender themselves to a glorious tumble in the surf. The consequences of parting with our last claim to intrinsic freedom，power，or worth，are real freedom，power and worth，really ours just because God gives them and because we know them to be (in another sense) not ""ours."" Anodos has got rid of his shadow."
"但是上帝也会改变我们相互的需求之爱，这需要平等的转变。事实上，我们所有人有时都需要，而有些人大多数时间内都需要来自他人的仁爱，这种仁爱是他们身上的上帝之爱，让他们去爱那些不可爱的人。但是，这虽然是我们需要的一种爱，却不是我们想要的那种爱。我们希望因为我们的聪明、美丽、慷慨、公正、有用而被爱。一旦意识到有人正在给我们最高的爱，这将是一个巨大的震撼。这已得到充分认可，以至于恶意的人会假装带着仁爱来爱我们，就是因为他们知道这会伤害到我们。对一个期待慈爱、友爱或情爱能够恢复的人说""作为一个基督徒，我原谅你了""，这仅仅是一个继续争吵的方式。那些这样说的人当然是在说谎。但是事情不会为了要伤害别人而被虚假地说出来，除非，如果这是真的，这种事也会伤害别人。","But God also transforms our Need-love for one another，and it requires equal transformation. In reality we all need at times ，some of us at most times，that Charity from others which，being Love Himself in them，loves the unlovable. But this，though a sort of love we need，is not the sort we want. We want to be loved for our cleverness，beauty，generosity，fairness，usefulness. The first hint that anyone is offering us the highest love of all is a terrible shock. This is so well recognised that spiteful people will pretend to be loving us with Charity precisely because they know that it will wound us. To say to one who expects a renewal of Affection，Friendship，or Eros，""I forgive you as a Christian"" is merely a way of continuing the quarrel.Those who say it are of course lying. But the thing would not be falsely said in order to wound unless，if it were true，it would be wounding."
"收到并且不断收到他人所给的那种不取决于我们自身吸引力的爱是多么的困难，这可以从一个极端的例子上看出来。假设你自己是一个新婚不久就染上了一种不愈之症的人，得了这种病又不会几年内就死去，你什么也干不了，身体虚弱，样子吓人，令人厌恶；你依靠妻子的收入生活，使你本希望去改善的地方变得贫穷；甚至智力上受到了损害，而且一阵阵不可控制地发脾气，总有不可避免的要求。假设你的妻子的关怀和怜悯是无穷无尽的。那个能够惬意地接受这些的男人，他能够没有任何怨恨地接受一切而不付出任何东西，他甚至能够回避那些令人讨厌的其实是要求爱抚和安慰的自我贬低，那么这个男人所做的事情是需求之爱仅在自然的条件下也不会获得的。(毫无疑问这样的妻子也将会做超出自然的赠予之爱的范围的事情，但是目前那还不是重点。)在这种情况下，接受比给予更困难，而且或许是比施予更受祝福的。但是这个极端的例子所说明的却是普遍的。我们都在接受仁爱。在我们每个人身上都有某种无法自然地被爱的东西。这绝不是谁的错，如果人们不那么爱宫的话。只有可爱的东西才能自然而然地被量。这倒不如让人们去喜欢变质面包的味道或者机械钻孔的声音，尽管这样，有了仁爱，我们就能被原谅、被怜悯、被爱，除此之外，别无他法。所有拥有好父母、好妻子、好丈夫或好儿女的人们，可以肯定的是，有时一一或许在某种独有的特性或习惯方面一直是一→也们正在接受仁爱，他们被爱，不是因为他们可爱，而是因为上帝之爱就在那些爱他们的人的身上。","How difficult it is to receive，and to go on receiving，from others a love that does not depend on our own attraction can be seen from an extreme case. Suppose yourself a man struck down shortly after marriage by an incurable disease which may not kill you for many years; useless，impotent，hideous，disgusting; dependent on your wife's earnings; impoverishing where you hoped to enrich; impaired even in intellect and shaken by gusts of uncontrollable temper，full of unavoidable demands. And suppose your wife's care and pity to be inexhaustible. The man who can take this sweetly，who can receive all and give nothing without resentment，who can abstain even from those tiresome self-depreciations which are really only a demand for petting and reassurance，is doing something which Need-love in its merely natural condition could not attain. (No doubt such a wife will also be doing something beyond the reach of a natural Gift-love，but that is not the point at present.) In such a case to receive is harder and perhaps more blessed than to give. But what the extreme example illustrates is universal. We are all receiving Charity. There is something in each of us that can not be naturally loved. It is no one's fault if they do not so love it. Only the lovable can be naturally loved. You might as well ask people to like the taste of rotten bread or the sound of a mechanical drill. We can be forgiven，and pitied，and loved in spite of it，with Charity; no other way. All who have good parents，wives，husbands，or children，may be sure that at some times-and perhaps at all times in respect of some one particular trait or habit-they are receiving Charity，are loved not because they are lovable but because Love Himself is in those who love them. "
"因此，被人类心灵所接纳的上帝，不仅改变赠予之爱，还改变需求之爱，不仅改变我们对上帝的需求之爱，还改变我们对彼此的需求之爱。这当然不是唯一可能发生的事情。上帝会降临，带着在我们看来是一个更加可怕的使命，而且要求自然之爱必须被完全放弃。一个崇高的但是可怕的使命，就像亚伯拉罕的使命一样，可能强迫一个人去抛弃他自己的人民和他父亲的家庭。情爱，当被指向了一个被禁止的对象时，可能也不得不牺牲。在这些情况下，这个过程虽然很难去忍受，却很容易理解。我们现在更容易忽视的是，即便当自然之爱被允许持续时，改变也 是必要的。","Thus God，admitted to the human heart，transforms not only Gift-love but Need-love; not only our Need-love of Him，but our Need-love of one another. This is of course not the only thing that can happen. He may come on what seems to us a more dreadful mission and demand that a natural love be totally renounced. A high and terrible vocation，like Abraham's，may constrain a man to turn his back on his own people and his father's house. Eros ，directed to a forbidden object，may have to be sacrificed. In such instances，the process，though hard to endure，is easy to understand. What we are more likely to overlook is the necessity for a transformation even when the natural love is allowed to continue."
"在这样的情况下，上帝的爱没有用自己采*取代*自然之爱一一就像是我们不得不丢掉银器为金器腾出空间一样。自然之爱被召唤起来变成仁爱的模式，同时仍然保持他们原本的自然之爱。","In such a case the Divine Love does not substitute itself for the natural­ as if we had to throw away our silver to make room for the gold. The natural loves are summoned to become modes of Charity while also remaining the natural loves they were."
"人们可以在这里立刻看到一种对化身本身的模仿，或者和韵，或者推论。这无需使我们吃惊，因为二者的开创者是相同的。正因为基督是完美的上帝和完美的人，自然之爱被呼唤变成完美的仁爱和完美的自然之爱。正如上帝变成人""不是把神性转化到人身上，而是把人性放到上帝身上""，这里的情况也一样，仁爱没有仅仅缩小成自然之爱，而是自然之爱融入到了上帝之爱中，被改造成为上帝之爱和谐的、顺从的工具。","One sees here at once a sort of echo or rhyme or corollary to the Incarnation itself. And this need not surprise us，for the Author of both is the same. As Christ is perfect God and perfect Man，the natural loves are called to become perfect Charity and also perfect natural loves. As God becomes Man ""Not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh，but by taking of the Manhood into God，""so here; Charity does not dwindle into merely natural love but natural love is taken up into，made the tuned and obedient instrument of，Love Himself."
"大多数基督徒都知道这如何能发生。自然之爱的所有的活动(除了罪恶之外)能够在一个有利的时刻变成高兴的、无羞耻的、感激的需求之爱的行为，或者是无私的、不唐突的赠予之爱的行为，这两者都是仁爱。没有什么东西太渺小或者太具兽性以至于不会被改变。一场游戏、一个笑话、一起唱杯酒、闲谈、一次散步、性行为一一所有这一切都能够成为我们在其中原谅或者接受原谅的模式，在那里我们安慰别人或者和别人和解，在那里我们""寻求的不是我们自己的气因此，在我们那些最本能、自然的欲望和娱乐中，爱已经为上帝本身准备了""一个肉身""。","How this can happen，most Christians know. All the activities (sins only excepted) of the natural loves can in a favoured hour become works of the glad and shameless and grateful Need-love or of the selfless，unofficious Gift-love，which are both Charity. Nothing is either too trivial or too animal to be thus transformed. A game，a joke，a drink together，idle chat，a walk，the act of Venus-all these can be modes in which we forgive or accept forgiveness，in which we console or are reconciled，in which we ""seek not our own."" Thus in our very instincts，appetites and recreations，Love has prepared for Himself ""a body."""
"但是我说的是""在一个有利的时刻内气时间转瞬即逝。从自然之爱到仁爱的完全的稳固的转变是一件如此困难的事情，以至于或许没有任何堕落的人类曾看见过这种完美的转变。不过，我认为爱必须这样改变的规律 是必然的。","But I said ""in a favoured hour."" Hours soon pass. The total and secure transformation of a natural love into a mode of Charity is a work so difficult that perhaps no fallen man has ever come within sight of doing it perfectly. Yet the law that loves must be so transformed is，I suppose，inexorable."
"这里的一个难题是，我们会像往常一样转错方向。一个基督徒一一一个过于在口头上表达的基督徒一一的圈子或家庭，抓住了这个原则，就可能用他们过分的举止，尤其用他们的语言显示自己已经实现了这点一一这个显示却是煞费苦心、繁琐、令人为难且无法忍受的。这样的人在公开场合和对待彼此时，把每一件琐事变成了明显具有精神上的重要性的事情(在一扇关闭的门后面，跪着对上帝说出来是另一回事)。他们总是多事地寻求别人的原谅或者令人无法忍受地去原谅别人。谁不愿意与那些普通人住在一起呢?这些普通人默默地克服他们的脾气(还有我们的)。吃一顿饭、睡一觉、或者一个玩笑就让一切和好如初了。我们所有的工作中，真正的原谅一定是最隐秘的。甚至连我们自己都不能发觉。我们的右手一定不能知道左手在干什么。我们还没有做得很隐秘，如果我们与孩子一起打扑克，""纯粹""是为了逗乐他们或者表明他们已经被原谅了。如果这是我们所能做的最好的，我们就应该这样做。但可能会更好的是，如果一个更深的、较无意的仁爱把我们投入一种心理框架中，在这种心理下与孩子们在一起的小小快乐便应该是我们在那一时刻最喜欢的事情。","One difficulty is that here，as usual，we can take a wrong turn. A Christian-a somewhat too vocally Christian-circle or family，having grasped this principle，can make a show，in their overt behaviour and especially in their words，of having achieved the thing itself-an elaborate，fussy，embarrassing and intolerable show. Such people make every trifle a matter of explicitly spiritual importance-out loud and to one another (to God，on their knees，behind a closed door, would be another matter). They are always unnecessarily asking，or insufferably offering，forgiveness. Who would not rather live with those ordinary people who get over their tantrums (and ours) unemphatically，letting a meal，a night's sleep，or a joke mend all? The real work must be，of all our works，the most secret. Even as far as possible secret from ourselves. Our right hand must not know what our left is doing. We have not got far enough if we play a game of cards with the children ""merely"" to amuse them or to show that they are forgiven. If this is the best we can do we are right to do it. But it would be better if a deeper，less conscious，Charity threw us into a frame of mind in which a little fun with the children was the thing we should at that moment like best."
"然而，在将自然之爱转化为仁爱这项必要的工作中，我们最抱怨的事制台给了我们极大的帮助。永远都不缺少这种引导使我们把自己的自然之爱转变成仁爱。这是由那些在所有的自然之爱中我们遇到的摩擦和挫折提供的自清楚的证据一一证明(自然的)爱不会是""足够的""一一是不会弄错的，除非我们被唯我主义蒙蔽了眼睛。当我们真的被蒙蔽了双眼，我们就会荒唐地使用这些摩擦和挫折。""要是我的孩子更出息一些(那个男孩一天天地越来越像他的父亲)就好了，那么我对他们的爱就完美无瑕了。""但是每个小孩子有时都容易惹人生气s大多数孩子并非偶尔令人讨厌。""要是我的丈夫能更加体贴、别这么懒惰、别这么浪费就好了""……""要是我的妻子少闹些情绪、更加理智些，并且不那么浪费就好了。""……""要是我的父亲不是如此讨厌、乏味、吝啬就好了。""但是在每个人身上，当然也在我们自己身上，都存在那种需要容忍、宽容和原谅的方面。实现这些美德的必要性首先会促使我们，迫使我们试图把我们的爱变成一一更严格地说，让上帝来转变成一一仁爱。这些苦恼和困难是有益的，甚至可能是在苦恼和因难最少的地方，自然之爱的转化是最困难的。它们充足的时候，超越自然之爱的必要性是明显的。当自然之爱被尘世条件完全满足且被它设置尽可能小的阻碍时，去超越它一一当一切看起来早已如此顺利时，去看清我们必须升华，这需要一种微妙的转化和一种更加细致的洞察力。就这点来讲，""有钱人""要进入天国可能同样会很困难。","We are，however，much helped in this necessary work by that very feature of our experience at which we most repine. The invitation to tum our natural loves into Charity is never lacking. It is provided by those frictions and frustrations that meet us in all of them; unmistakable, evidence that (natural) love is not going to be ""enough""-unmistakable，unless we are blinded by egotism. When we are，we use them absurdly. ""If only I had been more fortunate in my children (that boy gets more like his father every day) I could have loved them perfectly."" But every child is sometimes infuriating; most children are not infrequently odious. ""If only my husband were more considerate，less lazy，less extravagant"" ... ""If only my wife had fewer moods and more sense，and were less extravagant"" ... ""If my father wasn't so infernally prosy and close-fisted."" But in everyone ，and of course in ourselves，there is that which requires forbearance，tolerance，forgiveness. The necessity of practising these virtues first sets us，forces us，upon the attempt to turn-more strictly，to let God turn-our love into Charity. These frets and rubs are beneficial. It may even be that where there are fewest of them the conversion of natural love is most difficult. When they are plentiful the necessity of rising above it is obvious. To rise above it when it is as fully satisfied and as little impeded as earthly conditions allow-to see that we must rise when all seems so well already-this may require a subtler conversion and a more delicate insight. In this way also it may be hard for ""the rich"" to enter the Kingdom."
"不过，我相信，这种转化的必要性是不可改变的。至少，如果我们的自然之爱要进入天堂的生活中，就会是这样，它们能够进入天堂，事实上我们大多数人都相信这一点。我们或许希望肉体的复活也意味着我们所说的""更伟大肉体""的复活，即我们一般尘世生命构造的复活，连带着它的情感和关系。但是仅仅在一个条件下，不是上帝随意规定的一个条件，而必须是在天堂的特征中所固有的一个条件：不能成为神圣的东西都不会进入天堂。""血肉之躯""，纯粹的自然，不能继承那个王国。人能够升入天堂，仅仅是因为已经死去并升入天堂的基督是""在他身上形成的。""难道我们不能设想人的爱也是同样的吗?只有那些被上帝之爱渗入的爱才会升华为上帝之爱。只有当他们从某种程度和形式上与基督共担死亡，当他们身上的自然因素已经年复一年地被消磨殆尽了，或者经过某种突然的创伤而变化了，这些才能够和基督一起被升华。这个世界的方式才会消失。自然这个名字意味着暂时性。自然之爱希望永恒，仅仅当它们已经允许自己被带到仁爱的永恒之中时才行，至少是已经允许这个过程在尘世这里开始，在没有人能工作的黑夜来临之前。这个过程将永远含有一种死亡。无一例外。在我对妻子或朋友的爱中，唯一永恒的元素是向上帝之爱转化的存在。通过这种存在，其他的元素如果有什么希望的话，它们或许希望，就像我们的肉体所希望的，是从死亡中复活.因为只这一点在他们身上是神圣的，只这一点是上帝。","And yet，I believe，the necessity for the conversion is inexorable; at least，if our natural loves are to enter the heavenly life. That they can enter it most of us in fact believe. We may hope that the resurrection of the body means also the resurrection of what may be called our ""greater body""; the general fabric of our earthly life with its affections and relationships. But only on a condition; not a condition arbitrarily laid down by God，but one necessarily inherent in the character of Heaven: nothing can enter there which cannot become heavenly. ""Flesh and blood，""mere nature，cannot inherit that Kingdom. Man can ascend to Heaven only because the Christ，who died and ascended to Heaven，is ""formed in him."" Must we not suppose that the same is true of a man's loves? Only those into which Love Himself has entered will ascend to Love Himself (And these can be raised with Him only if they have，in some degree and fashion，shared His death;if the natural element in them has submitted-year after year, or in some sudden agony-to transmutation. The fashion of this world passes away.The very name of nature implies the transitory. Natural loves can hope for eternity only in so far as they have allowed themselves to be taken into the eternity of Charity; have at least allowed the process to begin here on earth，before the night comes when no man can work. And the process will always involve a kind of death. There is no escape. In my love for wife or friend the only eternal element is the transforming presence of Love Himself. By that presence，if at all，the other elements may hope，as our physical bodies hope，to be raised from the dead. For this only is holy in them, this only is the Lord."
"神学家有时间我们是否会在天堂里""认识彼此""，以及在尘世中存在的独特的爱的关系到那里是否会继续具有意义。这样回答似乎是合理的""这或许取决于它在尘世曾变成，或者将会变成何种爱。""因为，可以肯定的是，在永恒的世界里碰见那个人，而你在这里对他的爱，无论多么强烈，都仅仅是自然之爱，因此这甚至都称不上是一件令人感兴趣的事情。你在成年的时候，遇到小学时由于共同的兴趣或业余活动，而似乎成为你好朋友的人，这难道不像是那种情形吗?如果没有更多的东西，如果他和你是不同血缘，那么他现在就将成为一个完全陌生的人。你们两个人现在谁都不玩康克戏。你不再想要他用法语练习作业来换取你的帮助，用你的算术作业来换取他的帮助。在天堂里，我怀疑，那种从未体现上帝之爱的爱将同样是无关紧要的。因为自然已经消失了。所有非永恒的东西都己经永远过时了。","Theologians have sometimes asked whether we shall ""know one another"" in Heaven，and whether the particular love-relations worked out on earth would then continue to have any significance. It seems reasonable to reply: ""It may depend what kind of love it had become， or was becoming，on earth."" For，surely，to meet in the eternal world someone for whom your love in this，however strong，had been merely natural，would not be (on that ground) even interesting. Would it not be like meeting in adult life someone who had seemed to be a great friend at your preparatory school solely because of common interests and occupations? If there was nothing more，if he was not a kindred soul，he will now be a total stranger. Neither of you now plays conkers. You no longer want to swop your help with his French exercise for his help with your arithmetic. In Heaven I suspect，a love that had never embodied Love Himself would be equally irrelevant. For Nature has passed away. All that is not eternal is eternally out of date."
"但是我不能以这种语调来结束这本书，我不敢一一至少是因为我自己的渴望和恐惧促使我这样做的一一使任何丧失亲人和孤独的读者同意这普遍的幻想，即与已经过世的爱人重聚是基督徒生活的目标。否定这个或许在那些心碎的人听起来很刺耳且不真实，但是这必须要否定。","But I must not end on this note，I dare not-and all the less because longings and terrors of my own prompt me to do so--leave any bereaved and desolate reader confirmed in the widespread illusion that reunion with the loved dead is the goal of the Christian life. The denial of this may sound harsh and unreal in the ears of the broken hearted，but it must be denied."
"""你为了你自己创造了我们'，圣奥古斯丁说，""而我们的心却没有停息，直到它走向你。""在圣坛前面，或者在四月的小树林里半祈祷、半沉思的时候，这还容易使人相信一会儿，但在一个临终的人旁边听起来就像是嘲弄。但是我们会更加真实地被嘲弄，如果我们放弃这种方式，把安慰寄托于将来某天，再次与尘世所爱的人一起享受快乐，永不分离，除此之外，不再想别的一一甚至可能借助于降神会和召魂术。很难让人不去想象这样一种无限延长的尘世幸福将会使人完全地满足。","""Thou hast made us for thyself，""said St. Augustine，""and our heart has no rest till it comes to Thee."" This，so easy to believe for a brief moment before the altar or，perhaps，half-praying，half-meditating in an April wood，sounds like mockery beside a deathbed. But we shall be far more truly mocked if，casting this way，we pin our comfort on the hope-perhaps even with the aid of *séance* and necromancy-of some day，this time forever，enjoying the earthly Beloved again，and no more. It is hard not to imagine that such an endless prolongation of earthly happiness would be completely satisfying."
"但是，如果我可以相信自己的经验，我们会立刻得到一个严厉的警告说某些方面是错的。我们试图为了这个目的在另一个世界里使用我们的信仰的时候，那种信仰就会变弱。在我生命里信仰的确很强烈的那些时刻都正是上帝在我的思想中占核心地位的时候。相信上帝，那么我就能够把天堂当作一个必然的结果来相信。但是反过来一一首先相信与爱人的重聚，接着为了重聚而相信有天堂，最后，因为天堂而相信上帝一一这是行不通的。一个人当然能胡思乱想，但是一个自我批判的人不久就会不断意识到是他自己的幻想正在起作用，他知道他只是在编织一个幻想。思维较简单的灵魂会发现，他们所依赖的幻象缺少安慰和营养，只能通过可怜的自我催眠，或者卑劣的图画、诗歌、(更糟的是)巫术，才能激发出来些微真实。","But，if I may trust my own experience，we get at once a sharp warning that there is something wrong. The moment we attempt to use our faith in the other world for this purpose，that faith weakens. The moments in my life when it was really strong have all been moments when God Himself was central in my thoughts. Believing in Him，I could then believe in Heaven as a corollary. But the reverse process-believing first in reunion with the Beloved，and then，for the sake of that reunion，believing in Heaven，and finally，for the sake of Heaven，believing in God-this will not work. One can of course imagine things. But a self-critical person will soon be increasingly aware that the imagination at work is his own; he knows he is only weaving a fantasy. And simpler souls will find the phantoms they try to feed on void of all comfort and nourishment，only to be stimulated into some semblance of reality by pitiful effort of self-hypnotism，and perhaps by the aid of ignoble pictures and hymns and (what is worse) witches."
"因此我们通过经验发现，将尘世的安慰应用到天堂是没有好处的。天堂能够给予天堂的安慰，不能给其他的安慰。然而尘世也并不能给予尘世的安慰，不存在长久的尘世的安慰。","We find thus by experience that there is no good applying to Heaven for earthly comfort. Heaven can give heavenly comfort; no other kind. And earth cannot give earthly comfort either. There is no earthly comfort in the long run."
"因为，在一个纯粹由人类的爱组成的天堂里找到我们被创造出来的目的的梦想不可能成真，除非我们整个信仰都是错误的。我们为上帝而被创造。仅仅通过从某些方面像上帝，仅仅通过成为上帝美丽、慈爱、智醺或美德的表现形式，任何尘世的爱人才激发了我们的爱。不是我们太爱他们了，而是我们不太明白我们所爱的是什么。不是上帝要求我们离开这样熟悉的爱人，而转向一个陌生人。当我们看到了上帝的面孔，我们就会知道我们一直是认识他的。他一直是我们在尘世中经历的纯真之爱的一部分，一直创造，保持这些经验并且不停地在里面活动。他们里面所有真实的爱，即便在尘世也是上帝的而不是我们的，之所以是我们的也仅仅因为是他的。在天堂里，将不会有背弃我们尘世垦的爱人所要受的痛苦和承担的责任。首先，因为我们早已离开了，从画像转到本人，从模流转到泉眼，从他创造的可爱的生物转到上帝本身。第二，因为我们会发现他们都存在于上帝本身之中。通过爱上帝多于爱他们，我们将比现在更爱他们。","For the dream of finding our end，the thing we were made for，in a Heaven of purely human love could not be true unless our whole Faith were wrong. We were made for God. Only by being in some respect like Him，only by being a manifestation of His beauty，loving kindness，wisdom or goodness，has any earthly Beloved excited our love. It is not that we have loved them too much ，but that we did not quite understand what we were loving. It is not that we shall be asked to turn from them，80 dearly familiar，to a Stranger. When we see the face of God we shall know that we have always known it. He has been a party to，has made，sustained and moved moment by moment within，all our earthly experiences of innocent love. All that was true love in them was，even on earth，far more His than ours，and ours only because His. In Heaven there will be no anguish and no duty of turning away from our earthly Beloveds. First ，because we shall have turned already; from the portraits to the Original，from the rivulets to the Fountain，from the creatures He made lovable to Love Himself. But secondly，because we shall find them all in Him. By loving Him more than them we shall love them more than we now do."
"但是，所有那些都远在""=位一体的领地里""，而不在这里，不在哭泣的山谷里，不在被放逐的途中。在这尘世里，全都是丧亲和抛弃。丧亲的目的(它至今也影响着我们)可能已经强加于我们身上了。然后我们被迫努力去相信我们尚无法感觉到的东西，即相信上帝是我们真正所爱的人。这就是为何丧亲从某些方面对非信徒要比对我们更容易接受。非信徒能够咆哮、大发脾气、对宇窗挥拳，而且(如果他是个天才)会写出像豪斯曼和晗代一样的诗歌。但是我们，在最低潮的时候，当最少的努力对我们来说看起来都是太多的时候，我们必须开始去尝试那些看上去不可能的东西。","But all that is far away in ""the land of the Trinity，""not here in exile，in the weeping valley. Down here it is all loss and renunciation. The very purpose of the bereavement (so far as it affects ourselves) may have been to force this upon us. We are then compelled to try to believe ，what we cannot yet feel，that God is our true Beloved. That is why bereavement is in some ways easier for the unbeliever than for us. He can storm and rage and shake his fist at the universe，and (if he is a genius) write poems like Housman's or Hardy's. But we ，at our lowest ebb，when the least effort seems too much for us，must begin to attempt what seem impossibilities."
"""爱上帝容易吗？""一位老作家问道。""是很简单的，""他回答说，""对于那些爱上帝的人。""我使用的仁爱这个词(包含上帝的两个恩典。但是上帝能够给出第三个。他能唤醒人对他的一种超自然的欣赏之爱。这是人类在所有礼物中最渴望得到的。这种欣赏之爱，不是在我们的自然之爱里，甚至也不是在道德规范里，而是存在于所有人和天使生活的真正中心。有了这个，一切皆有可能。一本更好的书会从这里开始，而我的书必须在这里结束。我不敢再继续写下去了。上帝知道，而我不知道，我是否已经品尝过了这种爱。或许我仅仅是想象曾经晶尝过吧。那些像我一样拥有的想象力远远超过他们的顺从的人们，会易于受到公正的惩罚，我们能够轻易地想象远远离于我们能够真正达到的境界。如果把想象过的东西描绘出来，我们或许会使其他人，还有我们自己相信，我们真的曾经到过那里。如果我仅仅想象过这个，这是不是一个错觉呢?那种想象甚至曾在某些时候使得所有其他的欲望一一是的，甚至是和平、甚至是不再恐惧一一看起来像是破碎的玩具和凋零的花朵。或许吧。或许，对我们中的很多人来说，所有的体验不过是解释了(可以这么说)我们对上帝的爱是何等的欠缺。这是不够的。但这种体验有它的意义。如果我们不能""体验到上帝的存在""，那么体验上帝的不存在也是有意义的，我们逐渐意识到自己的无意识，直到我们感觉到自己像是站在一个巨大的瀑布旁边，却听不到任何声音，或者像一个故事里的人，朝镜子里看却看不到脸，或者像一个梦中的人，伸手去抓能看到的东西却没有触摸的感觉。知道一个人在做梦，就不再完全是沉睡。但是要想知道完全清醒的世界的消息，你必须向比我更好的人请教。","""Is it easy to love God?"" asks an old author. ""It is easy，""he replies，""to those who do it."" I have included two Graces under the word Charity. But God can give a third. He can awake in man ，towards Himself，a supernatural Appreciative love. This is of all gifts the most to be desired. Here，not in our natural loves，nor even in ethics，lies the true centre of all human and angelic life. With this all things are possible. And with this，where a better book would begin，mine must end. I dare not proceed. God knows，not I，whether I have ever tasted this love. Perhaps I have only imagined the tasting. Those like myself whose imagination far exceeds their obedience are subject to a just penalty; we easily imagine conditions far higher than any we have really reached. If we describe what we have imagined we may make others， and make ourselves，believe that we have really been there. And if I have only imagined it，is it a further delusion that even the imagining has at some moments made all other objects of desire-yes，even peace，even to have no more fears-look like broken toys and faded flowers? Perhaps. Perhaps，for many of us，all experience merely defines，so to speak，the shape of that gap where our love of God ought to be. It is not enough. It is something. If we cannot ""practice the presence of God，"" it is something to practice the absence of God，to become increasingly aware of our unawareness till we feel like men who should stand beside a great cataract and hear no noise，or like a man in a story who looks in a mirror and finds no face there，or a man in a dream who stretches out his hand to visible objects and gets no sensation of touch. To know that one is dreaming is to be no longer perfectly asleep. But for news of the fully waking world you must go to my betters."
