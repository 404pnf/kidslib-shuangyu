"讲故事的艺术","How to Tell a Story"
"作者：马克·吐温","by Mark Twain"
"幽默故事由美国人发明——它跟喜剧故事和诙谐故事不一样","The Humorous Story an American Development.—Its Difference from Comic and Witty Stories"
"我并不是宣称我讲起故事来很像样。我只是想说，我知道故事应该怎么讲，因为我曾经几乎每天都跟讲故事的行家里手呆在一起，并且一呆就是很多年。","I do not claim that I can tell a story as it ought to be told.I only claim to know how a story ought to be told, for I have been almost daily in the company of the most expert story-tellers for many years."
"故事有很多种，但只有一种难于驾驭——幽默故事。我主要就是谈这一类故事。幽默故事是美式的，喜剧故事是英式的，诙谐故事是法式的。幽默故事效果的产生取决于讲述的方式，而喜剧故事和诙谐故事的则依赖于故事本身。","There are several kinds of stories, but only one difficult kind—the humorous.I will talk mainly about that one.The humorous story is American, the comic story is English, the witty story is French.The humorous story depends for its effect upon the MANNER of the telling; the comic story and the witty story upon the MATTER."
"幽默故事可以扯得很远，想讲什么就讲什么，而且不一定要在最后得出什么要点；但喜剧故事和诙谐故事必须简短，并且结尾一定要有个笑点。讲幽默故事时是从头到尾都兴致勃勃，而其他两类则是突然大爆发。","The humorous story may be spun out to great length, and may wander around as much as it pleases, and arrive nowhere in particular; but the comic and witty stories must be brief and end with a point.The humorous story bubbles gently along, the others burst."
"严格说来，幽默故事是一个艺术品——高雅精湛的艺术——只有艺术家才能讲出味道来；但讲喜剧故事和诙谐故事则不需要什么艺术，任何人都可以讲。讲幽默故事的艺术——你明白的，我是指口头讲述，而不是书面阅读——是由美国人创造的，也一直保留在美国。","The humorous story is strictly a work of art—high and delicate art—and only an artist can tell it; but no art is necessary in telling the comic and the witty story; anybody can do it.The art of telling a humorous story—understand, I mean by word of mouth, not print— was created in America, and has remained at home."
"讲幽默故事时要严肃，演讲者要尽量掩盖他自己都隐隐怀疑不好笑的地方；但喜剧故事的演讲者会事先告诉你，那故事是他听到的最好笑的，然后兴高采烈地开讲，往往他自己是讲完后第一个发笑的人。有时候，如果他成功地让大家笑了，他会非常高兴，然后就会把故事的“笑点”重复一遍，并逐一扫视听众，博取掌声，之后还会再讲一遍好笑的地方。这看起来挺可悲的。","The humorous story is told gravely; the teller does his best to conceal the fact that he even dimly suspects that there is anything funny about it; but the teller of the comic story tells you beforehand that it is one of the funniest things he has ever heard, then tells it with eager delight, and is the first person to laugh when he gets through.And sometimes, if he has had good success, he is so glad and happy that he will repeat the “nub” of it and glance around from face to face, collecting applause, and then repeat it again.It is a pathetic thing to see."
"当然，通常情况下，那些看似杂乱无章、不连贯的幽默故事往往最后有一个笑点、核心点、爆料点，或者随你怎么称呼它。听故事的人必须机警，因为在很多时候讲故事的人会转移听众的注意力，特意以一种漫不经心的方式，不经意地说出笑点，并且还会装作不知道他抛出的正是笑点。","Very often, of course, the rambling and disjointed humorous story finishes with a nub, point, snapper, or whatever you like to call it.Then the listener must be alert, for in many cases the teller will divert attention from that nub by dropping it in a carefully casual and indifferent way, with the pretense that he does not know it is a nub."
"阿蒂默斯·沃德常常使用这个技巧。当听众过后才明白那个笑话、恍然大悟时，他会用无辜的眼神望着大家，一脸的惊奇，好像是在纳闷他们到底在笑什么。在他之前，丹·塞切尔就用过这种技巧；当今，奈、赖利和其他一些人也都在用。","Artemus Ward used that trick a good deal; then when the belated audience presently caught the joke he would look up with innocent surprise, as if wondering what they had found to laugh at.Dan Setchell used it before him, Nye and Riley and others use it today."
"但是，喜剧故事的演讲者不会对笑点一带而过；他会当着你的面大声喊出来——每次都是。当他把喜剧故事在英格兰、法国、德国和意大利印刷出来时，他会用斜体字来呈现笑点，并在后面加上大大的感叹号，有时还会用括号加以解释。所有这些真是让人沮丧，使人想与笑话一刀两断，再去过更好些的生活。","But the teller of the comic story does not slur the nub; he shouts it at you—every time.And when he prints it, in England, France, Germany, and Italy, he italicizes it, puts some whopping exclamation-points after it, and sometimes explains it in a parenthesis.All of which is very depressing, and makes one want to renounce joking and lead a better life."
"我来举个例子，看看喜剧故事是怎么讲的。故事的内容已经在世界上流传有一千二百年或一千五百年了。演讲者是这样讲的：","Let me set down an instance of the comic method, using an anecdote which has been popular all over the world for twelve or fifteen hundred years.The teller tells it in this way:"
"受伤的士兵","THE WOUNDED SOLDIER"
"在某一场战斗中，有个士兵被打断了腿，他哀求从身边匆匆跑过的另一个士兵把他背到后方去，同时告诉那个士兵自己失去了一条腿；于是战神马尔斯善良的儿子扛起了这个不幸的人，向后方跑去。子弹和炮弹四下纷飞，不久，一颗炮弹炸掉了受伤士兵的头颅——然而，救助他的士兵并没有发现。不一会儿，一个军官喝住他，说：","In the course of a certain battle a soldier whose leg had been shot off appealed to another soldier who was hurrying by to carry him to the rear, informing him at the same time of the loss which he had sustained; whereupon the generous son of Mars, shouldering the unfortunate, proceeded to carry out his desire.The bullets and cannon-balls were flying in all directions, and presently one of the latter took the wounded man’s head off—without, however, his deliverer being aware of it.In no long time he was hailed by an officer, who said:"
"“你准备带着尸体去哪儿？”","“Where are you going with that carcass?”"
"“去后方，长官——他失去了一条腿！”","“To the rear, sir—he’s lost his leg!”"
"“一条腿，确定吗？”军官一脸诧异地说，“你是指他的头吧，傻瓜。”","“His leg, forsooth?” responded the astonished officer; “you mean his head, you booby.”"
"于是士兵把背着的战友放下，低头看看，表情十分困惑。最后他说：","Whereupon the soldier dispossessed himself of his burden, and stood looking down upon it in great perplexity.At length he said:"
"“是的，长官，您说的对。”他停顿了一下，补充道，","“It is true, sir, just as you have said.”Then after a pause he added,"
"“但是，他告诉我他只是丢了一条腿啊！！！！！”","“BUT HE TOLD ME IT WAS HIS LEG!!!!!”"
"此刻，说故事的人爆发出一阵又一阵雷鸣般的狂笑；在喘息或狂笑的间隙，或在笑得快憋过气的时候，他又一次次地重复笑点。","Here the narrator bursts into explosion after explosion of thunderous horse-laughter, repeating that nub from time to time through his gasping and shriekings and suffocatings."
"用讲喜剧故事的方法来讲这则故事只要一分半钟，毕竟，这故事其实根本不值得讲。如果用讲幽默故事的方法，这故事则要讲上十分钟，而且这大概是我听过的最有趣的故事——就像詹姆斯·惠特科姆·赖利讲的那样。","It takes only a minute and a half to tell that in its comic-story form; and isn’t worth the telling, after all.Put into the humorous-story form it takes ten minutes, and is about the funniest thing I have ever listened to—as James Whitcomb Riley tells it."
"他讲故事的时候扮作一个反应迟钝的老农夫。老农夫头一回听到这个故事，感觉它是说不出的滑稽，现在正要把它复述给邻居听。但他记不清了，所以他把所有情节都混在一起，无助地绕过来绕过去，添了很多乏味的细节，而这些细节根本与故事无关，只能使故事变得冗长；他有意识地把这些细节从故事中剔除出去，同时又添进了同样没用的新细节；他时不时地犯些小错误，又停下来纠正，还要解释怎么会犯这样的错；他想起刚才忘记讲的内容，又退回去讲；他讲着讲着停了好长一会儿，来回想那个受伤士兵的名字，最后他记起来伤兵的名字根本没人提起过，于是平静地说这个名字并不是真的重要，不管怎样——当然，如果有人知道的话就更好，但不知道也没什么，毕竟——等等，等等，等等。","He tells it in the character of a dull-witted old farmer who has just heard it for the first time, thinks it is unspeakably funny, and is trying to repeat it to a neighbor.But he can’t remember it; so he gets all mixed up and wanders helplessly round and round, putting in tedious details that don’t belong in the tale and only retard it; taking them out conscientiously and putting in others that are just as useless; making minor mistakes now and then and stopping to correct them and explain how he came to make them; remembering things which he forgot to put in in their proper place and going back to put them in there; stopping his narrative a good while in order to try to recall the name of the soldier that was hurt, and finally remembering that the soldier’s name was not mentioned, and remarking placidly that the name is of no real importance, anyway—better, of course, if one knew it, but not essential, after all—and so on, and so on, and so on."
"演讲者很高兴，满脸的无辜，对自己很是满意，每过一会儿就不得不停一停，以免自己肆无忌惮地笑出来；他确实憋住了，但心里在笑，身体像果冻一样抖得厉害；最后十分钟，他要讲完的时候，听众已经笑得精疲力竭，泪流满面了。","The teller is innocent and happy and pleased with himself, and has to stop every little while to hold himself in and keep from laughing outright; and does hold in, but his body quakes in a jelly-like way with interior chuckles; and at the end of the ten minutes the audience have laughed until they are exhausted, and the tears are running down their faces."
"老农夫那种朴实、天真、诚挚和粗心的感觉被模仿得惟妙惟肖，整场演出极其精彩，让人沉醉。这是一种艺术——精美、动人，只有大师才能驾驭；而机器讲的却是另一种故事。","The simplicity and innocence and sincerity and unconsciousness of the old farmer are perfectly simulated, and the result is a performance which is thoroughly charming and delicious.This is art—and fine and beautiful, and only a master can compass it; but a machine could tell the other story."
"把一些不合时宜、荒唐的东西漫不经心地拼凑在一起，有时可能根本没什么特别用意，而且表现得好像根本没意识到它们的荒唐之处，这就是美国艺术的基础，如果我没理解错的话。另一个特征是要模糊笑点。第三则是要不经意间讲出事先精心准备好的故事，就好像不小心把心里想的说出来了。第四，也是最后一个要点，就是停顿。","To string incongruities and absurdities together in a wandering and sometimes purposeless way, and seem innocently unaware that they are absurdities, is the basis of the American art, if my position is correct.Another feature is the slurring of the point.A third is the dropping of a studied remark apparently without knowing it, as if one where thinking aloud.The fourth and last is the pause."
"阿蒂默斯·沃德经常使用第三和第四种技巧。开始讲故事的时候，他表现得兴致盎然，好像认为它很精彩；然后慢慢地没了信心，明显心不在焉地停顿了一会儿后，像是自言自语一样添了句不搭调的评论；这句评论才是意在引发观众爆笑的导火索——而它确实达到了这个效果。","Artemus Ward dealt in numbers three and four a good deal.He would begin to tell with great animation something which he seemed to think was wonderful; then lose confidence, and after an apparently absent-minded pause add an incongruous remark in a soliloquizing way; and that was the remark intended to explode the mine—and it did."
"例如，他会热切而兴奋地讲：“我以前认识一个新西兰人，他嘴巴里一颗牙齿都没有”——讲到这儿，他的激情突然没了；接着在一阵深思熟虑的安静停顿后，他又梦呓似地自言自语道：“但他打鼓打得比我见过的任何人都棒。”","For instance, he would say eagerly, excitedly, “I once knew a man in New Zealand who hadn’t a tooth in his head”—here his animation would die out; a silent, reflective pause would follow, then he would say dreamily, and as if to himself, “and yet that man could beat a drum better than any man I ever saw.”"
"无论讲哪种故事，适当的停顿都非常重要，也是一个常常反复使用的要素。停顿是很有讲究的，需要精心设计，没有固定的模式，带有一定的欺骗性。因为停顿的长短必须恰到好处——不能太长，也不能太短——不然，不仅达不到预期效果，还会引起麻烦。如果停顿太短，激起听众情绪的点一下子过去了，听众就会有时间想到一个惊喜已经设计好了——当然，如果那样的话，你就不能给他们带来惊喜了。","The pause is an exceedingly important feature in any kind of story, and a frequently recurring feature, too.It is a dainty thing, and delicate, and also uncertain and treacherous; for it must be exactly the right length—no more and no less—or it fails of its purpose and makes trouble.If the pause is too short the impressive point is passed, and the audience have had time to divine that a surprise is intended—and then you can’t surprise them, of course."
"我曾在舞台上讲过一个黑人的鬼故事，在结尾的笑点的前面，需要有个停顿，而这个停顿在整个故事中是最为重要的部分。如果能精准地控制好停顿长度，我就能达到快结束时那种爆发性的惊人效果，让某个敏感的女孩惊叫着从座位上跳起来——这正是我追求的效果。这则名叫《金手臂》的故事就是用这种方式讲述的。你自己可以练着讲讲——注意停顿，要恰到好处。","On the platform I used to tell a negro ghost story that had a pause in front of the snapper on the end, and that pause was the most important thing in the whole story.If I got it the right length precisely, I could spring the finishing ejaculation with effect enough to make some impressible girl deliver a startled little yelp and jump out of her seat—and that was what I was after.This story was called “The Golden Arm,” and was told in this fashion.You can practice with it yourself—and mind you look out for the pause and get it right."
"金手臂","THE GOLDEN ARM"
"从前，有个非常抠门的人，他住在很远的大草原上，本来他有老婆的。但是不久他老婆就死了，他就把她的尸体拖到大草原上埋了。要知道，她有条金手臂——从肩膀往下都是纯金的。他抠门得很——抠得厉害；那天晚上他怎么也睡不着，因为他太想要那条金手臂了。","Once ’pon a time dey wuz a momsus mean man, en he live ’way out in de prairie all ’lone by hisself, ’cep’n he had a wife.En bimeby she died, en he tuck en toted her way out dah in de prairie en buried her.Well, she had a golden arm—all solid gold, fum de shoulder down.He wuz pow’ful mean—pow’ful; en dat night he couldn’t sleep, caze he want dat golden arm so bad."
"夜深了，他实在忍不住，就起了床，提着灯，迎着暴风雨去挖尸体，好取回那只金手臂；他顶着风，埋着头，在雪地里不停地挖。这时，他突然停了下来（这里要停顿一段时间，表现出惊恐的样子，装作在听什么）说：“我的天，那是什么？”","When it come midnight he couldn’t stan’ it no mo’; so he git up, he did, en tuck his lantern en shoved out thoo de storm en dug her up en got de golden arm; en he bent his head down ’gin de ’win, en plowed en plowed en plowed thoo de snow.Den all on a sudden he stop (make a considerable pause here, and look startled, and take a listening attitude) en say: “My LAN’, what’s dat?”"
"他竖着耳朵——听——听到风的声音（咬住牙，模仿风的哀泣，还有呜呜奏着悲乐的声音），“呼吱吱吱吱”——他又跑去坟墓那里，他听到有人在说话！人的声音混在风声里——几乎分辨不出来——“呼吱吱吱——吱吱吱——谁——拿——走——了——我——的——金——手臂？”（此刻，你一定开始剧烈的颤抖。）","En he listen—en listen—en de win’ say (set your teeth together and imitate the wailing and wheezing singsong of the wind), “Bzzz-z-zzz”—en den, way back yonder whah de grave is, he hear a VOICE!—he hear a voice all mix’ up in de win’—can’t hardly tell ’em ’part—“Bzzz—zzz—W-h-o—g-o-t—m-y—g-o-l-d-e-n ARM?”(You must begin to shiver violently now.)"
"他开始发抖，颤颤地说：“哦，天哪！哦，我的天！”然后灯被风吹灭了，雪夹杂着水向他扑面而来，几乎快让他窒息，他拼命往家爬，差点丧命，他呻吟着——很快，他又听到了那个声音，（停顿）就跟在他身后！“呼吱吱吱——吱吱吱——谁——拿——走——了——我——的——金——手臂？”","En he begin to shiver en shake, en say, “Oh, my!OH, my lan’!” en de win’ blow de lantern out, en de snow en sleet blow in his face en mos’ choke him, en he start a-plowin’ knee-deep toward home mos’ dead, he so sk’yerd—en pooty soon he hear de voice agin, en (pause) it ’us comin AFTER him!“Bzzz—zzz—zzz W-h-o—g-o-t—m-y—g-o-l-d-e-n—ARM?”"
"当他回到草原上时，他又听到了那个声音——而且更近了，一直跟着——混杂在黑夜的暴风雨中——（重复模仿风的声音和那个人的声音）到家后，他马上冲上楼，跳到床上，把自己的头和耳朵都蒙了起来，躺在那里直发抖——他又听到了那个声音——又跟来了！慢慢地，他听到（停顿一下，表现出紧张的样子，装作在听）——啪——啪——啪上楼的声音！之后他听到开门的声音，他意识到此刻有东西进了屋！","When he git to de pasture he hear it agin—closter now, en A-COMIN’!—a-comin’ back dah in de dark en de storm—(repeat the wind and the voice).When he git to de house he rush upstairs en jump in de bed en kiver up, head and years, en lay da shiverin’ en shakin’—en den way out dah he hear it AGIN!—en a-COMIN’!En bimeby he hear (pause—awed, listening attitude)—pat—pat—pat HIT’S A-COMIN’ UPSTAIRS!Den he hear de latch, en he KNOW it’s in de room!"
"然后很快他就感觉到，那东西就站在床边！（停顿）接着——他感觉到有东西向自己身上压了过来——他快不能呼吸了！这时——这时——他好像感觉到了个冰冷的东西，正贴近自己的脑袋。（停顿）","Den pooty soon he know it’s a-STANNIN’ BY DE BED!(Pause.) Den—he know it’s a-BENDIN’ DOWN OVER HIM—en he cain’t skasely git his breath!Den—den—he seem to feel someth’n’ C-O-L-D, right down ’most agin his head!(Pause.)"
"然后那个声音说，就在他耳边——“谁——拿走——了——我——的——金——手臂？”（你一定要非常悲哀地，又带着责备地哭喊出来；然后，你直勾勾地盯住远处的观众——最好是个女孩——让恐怖的效果在凝重的寂静中自己慢慢累积。当停顿时间长短刚好合适时，突然对着那个女孩跳起来，并大喊道：“就是你！”","Den de voice say, RIGHT AT HIS YEAR—“W-h-o—g-o-t—m-y g-o-l-d-e-n ARM?”(You must wail it out very plaintively and accusingly; then you stare steadily and impressively into the face of the farthest-gone auditor—a girl, preferably—and let that awe-inspiring pause begin to build itself in the deep hush.When it has reached exactly the right length, jump suddenly at that girl and yell, “YOU’VE got it!”"
"如果你把停顿控制得恰到好处，她会尖叫着跳起来，没准鞋子都可能被甩掉。但一定要控制好停顿，然后你会发现，这是你做过的最复杂、最让人烦心、最没把握的事情。）","If you’ve got the PAUSE right, she’ll fetch a dear little yelp and spring right out of her shoes.But you MUST get the pause right; and you will find it the most troublesome and aggravating and uncertain thing you ever undertook.)"
