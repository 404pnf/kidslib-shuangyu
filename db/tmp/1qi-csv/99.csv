"复活日那天","The Day Resurgent"
"作者：欧·亨利","by O. Henry"
"我能看到画家着手要画复活节欢乐图时咬着铅笔的尾端，皱着眉头；因为对于适合复活节欢乐图的人物形象，他只有四种构想。","I can see the artist bite the end of his pencil and frown when it comes to drawing his Easter picture; for his legitimate pictorial conceptions of figures pertinent to the festival are but four in number."
"首先是异教的伊丝特尔——春之女神。在这里，画家的想象力可以得到自由发挥。一位面容美丽、头发飘逸、脚趾健全的少女就能符合要求。著名的模特克拉丽斯·圣瓦瓦苏小姐将在“春卷图”或特里彼所称的不管叫什么的图画里扮成伊斯特尔。","First comes Easter, pagan goddess of spring.Here his fancy may have free play.A beautiful maiden with decorative hair and the proper number of toes will fill the bill.Miss Clarice St. Vavasour, the well-known model, will pose for it in the “Lethergogallagher,” or whatever it was that Trilby called it."
"第二个人——眼睛向上看的、四周有百合花作陪衬的、表情忧郁的淑女。这虽然有点儿杂志封面女郎的味道，但是可靠。","Second—the melancholy lady with upturned eyes in a framework of lilies.This is magazine-covery, but reliable."
"第三个人——参加第五大道复活节游行的曼哈顿小姐。","Third—Miss Manhattan in the Fifth Avenue Easter Sunday parade."
"第四个人——玛吉·墨菲，她头戴一顶旧草帽，草帽上插着一根赞新的红色羽毛，高兴而忸怩不自然地站在格兰街岔路口。","Fourth—Maggie Murphy with a new red feather in her old straw hat, happy and self-conscious, in the Grand Street turnout."
"当然，复活兔不值一提。彩蛋同样不值一提，因为高等考证已经把这些彩蛋都煮得太老了。","Of course, the rabbits do not count.Nor the Easter eggs, since the higher criticism has hard-boiled them."
"复活节绘画有限的题材范围证明，在所有节日当中，我们认为复活节是最模糊、转变最大的一个节日。尽管它是由异教徒创立的，但它却属于所有的宗教。追溯到第一个春季，我们会看到夏娃骄傲地从无花果树上摘下一片新生绿叶来遮掩自己的下体。","The limited field of its pictorial possibilities proves that Easter, of all our festival days, is the most vague and shifting in our conception.It belongs to all religions, although the pagans invented it.Going back still further to the first spring, we can see Eve choosing with pride a new green leaf from the tree ficus carica."
"现在，这段具有批评性的、有见地的开场白的目标在于阐明一个定理：复活节既不是一个日期、一个季节、一个喜庆日、一个节假日，也不是一个场合。跟随丹尼·麦克里的脚步，你将会发现复活节到底是什么。","Now, the object of this critical and learned preamble is to set forth the theorem that Easter is neither a date, a season, a festival, a holiday nor an occasion.What it is you shall find out if you follow in the footsteps of Danny McCree."
"复活节一大早就如期而至，它在日历上的位置就在周六与周一之间。五点二十四分时，太阳升起了；十点三十分时，丹尼以太阳为榜样也起床了。他走进厨房，到水池边洗脸。他的妈妈正在煎熏肉。当看到儿子把弄圆形肥皂时那种认真、平和、机敏的神态时，她想起了孩子的父亲。就在二十二年前，她第一次见他打棒球，那是在哈莱姆的一块空地上，也就是如今帕洛马公寓坐落的地方，他站在二垒和三垒之间，接一个棘手的滚地球。此时在公寓前屋，丹尼的父亲坐在一扇打开的窗户旁边吸烟斗，他原本就蓬乱的灰白色头发被微风吹得更加凌乱。尽管两年前一次巨型炸药的提前爆炸炸瞎了他的眼睛，但他还是好抽烟斗。很少有盲人喜欢抽烟，因为他们自己看不到抽烟时的袅袅烟雾。你若看不到标题的颜色，那你还能喜欢别人给你读晚报新闻听么？","Easter Sunday dawned as it should, bright and early, in its place on the calendar between Saturday and Monday.At 5.24 the sun rose, and at 10.30 Danny followed its example.He went into the kitchen and washed his face at the sink.His mother was frying bacon.She looked at his hard, smooth, knowing countenance as he juggled with the round cake of soap, and thought of his father when she first saw him stopping a hot grounder between second and third twenty-two years before on a vacant lot in Harlem, where the La Paloma apartment house now stands.In the front room of the flat Danny’s father sat by an open window smoking his pipe, with his loriaes gray hair tossed about by the breeze.He still clung to his pipe, although his sight had been taken from him two years before by a precocious blast of giant powder that went off without permission.Very few blind men care for smoking, for the reason that they cannot see the smoke.Now, could you enjoy having the news read to you from an evening newspaper unless you could see the colors of the headlines?"
"“今天是复活节。”麦克里太太说。","“’Tis Easter Day,” said Mrs. McCree."
"“我想吃煎蛋，不吃煮的。”丹尼说。","“Scramble mine,” said Danny."
"早饭后，他穿上了盛装，那是安息日早上运河街进口商店的货车车夫去教堂做礼拜才穿的衣服：一件礼服大衣、一条条纹裤子、一双黑漆皮鞋和悬挂在胸前的镀金表链、硬翻领衬衫、卷边圆形常礼帽和从舍恩斯坦销售店（在第十四街和托尼水果摊之间）周六晚上搞促销时买来的蝴蝶领结。","After breakfast he dressed himself in the Sabbath morning costume of the Canal Street importing house dray chauffeur—frock coat, striped trousers, patent leathers, gilded trace chain across front of vest, and wing collar, rolled-brim derby and butterfly bow from Schonstein’s (between Fourteenth Street and Tony’s fruit stand) Saturday night sale."
"“你今天要出去，那是当然的了，丹尼，”老麦克里略带伤感地说，“他们说这算是一种节日。呵，这春天的天气就是好。我从空气中就能感觉到。”","“You’ll be goin’ out this day, of course, Danny,” said old man McCree, a little wistfully.“’Tis a kind of holiday, they say.Well, it’s fine spring weather.I can feel it in the air.”"
"“我为什么不该出去呢？”丹尼以胸音暴躁地问道，“我就应该呆在家里是吗？难道我还没有一匹马的待遇好吗？我们拉车队的马每周还休息一天呢。我想知道是谁挣钱交房租还让你刚才有早饭吃的？说啊，说来听听！”","“Why should I not be going out?” demanded Danny in his grumpiest chest tones.“Should I stay in?Am I as good as a horse?One day of rest my team has a week.Who earns the money for the rent and the breakfast you’ve just eat, I’d like to know?Answer me that!”"
"“好吧，孩子，”老人说，“我不是在抱怨。我的眼睛没出事的时候，我觉得什么也比不上周日出去玩。风中夹杂着草地和烧树枝的气味。我有烟可以抽。孩子，你好好玩，好好放松放松吧。有时我真希望你妈会读书，这样我就能听到那个关于希伯伯托马斯的故事剩下的部分了——不过算了，不提了。”","“All right, lad,” said the old man.“I’m not complainin’.While me two eyes was good there was loria’ better to my mind than a Sunday out.There’s a smell of turf and burnin’ brush comin’ in the windy.I have me tobaccy.A good fine day and rist to ye, lad.Times I wish your mother had larned to read, so I might hear the rest about the hippopotamus—but let that be.”"
"“他现在说的关于河马的蠢话是怎么回事？”丹尼穿过厨房时问他的妈妈，“你带他去动物园了？去那儿做什么？”","“Now, what is this foolishness he talks of hippopotamuses?” asked Danny of his mother, as he passed through the kitchen.“Have you been taking him to the Zoo?And for what?”"
"“我没有带他去，”麦克里太太说，“他整日在窗口享受微风。这种娱乐消遣是穷人家的盲人所仅有的。我想盲人有时会沉浸在他们的想象之中。有一天他谈起了油脂，大概说了有一个小时，都没停过。我还以为是煎锅里的油烧得着火了。结果不是。他说我不懂。丹尼，对于一个盲人来说，所有的星期日和节日都很无聊。他眼睛好好的时候，身强体壮，谁都没法和他比。今天天气不错，儿子。好好享受这个上午吧。我们晚上六点吃冷餐。”","“I have not,” said Mrs. McCree.“He sets by the windy all day.’Tis little recreation a blind man among the poor gets at all.I’m loriae’ they wander in their minds at times.One day he talks of grease without loriae’ for the most of an hour.It looks to see if there’s lard burnin’ in the fryin’ pan.There is not.He says I do not understand.’Tis weary days, Sundays, and holidays and all, for a blind man, Danny.There was no better nor stronger than him when he had his two eyes.’Tis a fine day, son.Injoy yeself ag’inst the morning.There will be cold supper at six.”"
"“你曾听到有人谈起过河马吗？”丹尼下楼出门时，问看门人迈克。","“Have you heard any talk of a hippopotamus?” asked Danny of Mike, the janitor, as he went out the door downstairs."
"“我从没听说过，”迈克边说边把衬衣袖子卷起老高，“不过这两天，他们向我申诉的各种关于动物、大自然和非法恶行的清单中就唯独没有你说的这项。你去找房东。要不然，如果你喜欢的话，可以搬走。你们家租的房子里有河马吗？没有，说它干嘛！”","“I have not,” said Mike, pulling his shirtsleeves higher.“But ’tis the only subject in the animal, natural and illegal lists of outrages that I’ve not been complained to about these two days.See the landlord.Or else move out if ye like.Have ye hippopotamuses in the lease?No, then?”"
"“是那个老头说的，”丹尼说，“可能没什么意思。”","“It was the old man who spoke of it,” said Danny.“Likely there’s nothing in it.”"
"丹尼走向大街，然后向北走到这一区的中心地带，在那里，伊斯特尔——时髦的伊斯特尔穿着崭新的、耀眼的服饰——率领着复活节的游行队伍。高耸的褐色教堂里传来合唱队轻快的圣歌。宽阔的人行道就像移动着的、充满活力的鲜花——当你看到那些楚楚动人、如花似玉的姑娘们时也会有这种感觉。","Danny walked up the street to the Avenue and then struck northward into the heart of the district where Easter—modern Easter, in new, bright raiment—leads the pascal march.Out of towering brown churches came the blithe music of anthems from the choirs.The broad sidewalks were moving parterres of living flowers—so it seemed when your eye looked upon the Easter girl."
"绅士们穿着礼服大衣，头戴丝绸礼帽，胸带栀子花，保持着这项传统的背景。孩子们手里拿着百合花。有钱人家富丽堂皇的大宅第的窗户上摆满了百合仙子的妹妹弗洛拉最华丽的创作。","Gentlemen, frock-coated, silk-hatted, gardeniaed, sustained the background of the tradition.Children carried lilies in their hands.The windows of the brownstone mansions were packed with the most opulent creations of Flora, the sister of the Lady of the Lilies."
"那个在街头拐角处走来走去、戴着白色手套、脸色红润、衣服前面的纽扣排列整齐的巡警是科里根。丹尼认识他。","Around a corner, white-gloved, pink-gilled and tightly buttoned, walked Corrigan, the cop, shield to the curb.Danny knew him."
"“嘿，科里根，”他问，“为什么过复活节呢？我知道复活节是三月十七号后的第一个满月后的星期日——但为什么呢？它是一个特有的、宗教的仪式，还是政府出于政治考虑规定的节日呢？”","“Why, Corrigan,” he asked, “is Easter?I know it comes the first time you’re full after the moon rises on the seventeenth of March—but why?Is it a proper and religious ceremony, or does the Governor appoint it out of politics?”"
"“这是一年一度的庆祝活动，”科里根带着第三任副警察局局长评判的口吻说道，“尤其对纽约来说。“它后来发展到了哈莱姆黑人住宅区。有时他们会派后备队到第一百二十五街。不过我并不觉得这是出于政治的考虑。”","“’Tis an annual celebration,” said Corrigan, with the judicial air of the Third Deputy Police Commissioner, “peculiar to New York.It extends up to Harlem.Sometimes they has the reserves out at One Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street.In my opinion ’tis not political.”"
"“谢谢，”丹尼说，“还有就是——你有没有听人抱怨过河马？我的意思是，尤其在他没有喝醉的情况下。”","“Thanks,” said Danny.“And say—did you ever hear a man complain of hippopotamuses?When not specially in drink, I mean.”"
"“那东西比海龟大，”科里根沉思着说道，“而且它的体内还含有甲醇。”","“Nothing larger than sea turtles,” said Corrigan, reflecting, “and there was wood alcohol in that.”"
"丹尼迷惘了。在享受礼拜日的同时又要过好复活节成了他这一天的双重重任。","Danny wandered.The double, heavy incumbency of enjoying simultaneously a Sunday and a festival day was his."
"辛勤劳作的工人的悲伤很适合他现在的心情。他们如此疲倦，以至于最好的量身定做的衣服的别致线条也掩饰不住。这就是为什么那些富足的的铅笔和钢画家总把普通人们作为他们作品中引人注目的忧伤原型。但当这个腓力斯人自娱自乐时，悲剧女神墨尔波墨的冷酷神情，总出现在他的画布上。所以，丹尼表情僵硬地对着伊斯特尔，并苦恼地寻找着快乐。","The sorrows of the hand-toiler fit him easily.They are worn so often that they hang with the picturesque lines of the best tailor-made garments.That is why well-fed artists of pencil and pen find in the griefs of the common people their most striking models.But when the Philistine would disport himself, the grimness of Melpomene, herself, attends upon his capers.Therefore, Danny set his jaw hard at Easter, and took his pleasure sadly."
"很多家庭都可以到杜根小餐馆就餐；一杯黑啤酒下肚后，丹尼也沉浸在这春天的气氛中。坐在黑暗、铺有漆布、潮湿的里屋，他的思绪还在探寻这个春季狂欢节的神秘意义。","The family entrance of Dugan’s café was feasible; so Danny yielded to the vernal season as far as a glass of bock.Seated in a dark, linoleumed, humid back room, his heart and mind still groped after the mysterious meaning of the springtime jubilee."
"“嘿，蒂姆，”他对服务员说，“他们为什么要过复活节啊？”","“Say, Tim,” he said to the waiter, “why do they have Easter?”"
"“得了吧！”蒂姆老于世故地闭上了一只眼睛说道，“复活节有什么新鲜的？好了。我猜托尼牧师昨晚给你答案了。我放弃了。答案是什么——是两个苹果，还是一码半？”","“Skiddoo!” said Tim, closing a sophisticated eye.“Is that a new one?All right.Tony Pastor’s for you last night, I guess.I give it up.What’s the answer—two apples or a yard and a half?”"
"从杜根餐馆出来，丹尼朝东往回走。四月的太阳使他有一种朦胧的、连自己都解释不清的感觉。他作了一个错误的判断，觉得凯蒂·康伦知道答案。","From Dugan’s Danny turned back eastward.The April sun seemed to stir in him a vague feeling that he could not construe.He made a wrong diagnosis and decided that it was Katy Conlon."
"他在大街上离凯蒂家仅隔一个街区的地方碰见了她，她正要去教堂。他们在拐角处握手问好。","A block from her house on Avenue A he met her going to church.They pumped hands on the corner."
"“哎呀！你看起来闷闷不乐的，打扮倒挺正式，”凯蒂说，“怎么了？跟我一块儿去教堂吧，开心点儿。”","“Gee! But you look dumpish and dressed up,” said Katy.“What’s wrong?Come away with me to church and be cheerful.”"
"“去教堂干什么啊？”丹尼问。","“What’s doing at church?” asked Danny."
"“干什么？今天是复活节啊。傻瓜！我一直等到十一点，还以为你会从这儿路过和我一块儿去呢。”","“Why, it’s Easter Sunday.Silly!I waited till after eleven expectin’ you might come around to go.”"
"“这个复活节代表什么，凯蒂？”丹尼一筹莫展地问，“好像没人知道。”","“What does this Easter stand for, Katy,” asked Danny gloomily.“Nobody seems to know.”"
"“没有人和你一样不长眼睛，”凯蒂兴致高昂地说，“你都不看看我的新帽子，还有裙子。复活节是什么节日，是所有女孩都穿上崭新春装的日子。傻瓜！你要跟我一块儿去教堂吗？”","“Nobody as blind as you,” said Katy with spirit.“You haven’t even looked at my new hat.And skirt.Why, it’s when all the girls put on new spring clothes.Silly!Are you coming to church with me?”"
"“我去。”丹尼说，“如果复活节是从那儿开始的话，他们应该给点儿理由。帽子的确很漂亮。绿玫瑰也美极了。”","“I will,” said Danny.“If this Easter is pulled off there, they ought to be able to give some excuse for it.Not that the hat ain’t a beauty.The green roses are great.”"
"在教堂里，牧师非常流利地对复活节进行着详细说明。他讲话的速度很快，因为他急着回家享受安息日的大餐；但他知道得先完成自己的工作。他的主题围绕一个词——复活。不是新造出来的生命，而是一个新生命从旧的生命中诞生。教堂会众以前就经常听到这个故事。在距离布道台第六排的座位上有一顶极美的帽子，是用香豌豆花和薰衣草编制而成的。它引起了许多人的注意。","At church the preacher did some expounding with no pounding.He spoke rapidly, for he was in a hurry to get home to his early Sabbath dinner; but he knew his business.There was one word that controlled his theme—resurrection.Not a new creation; but a new life arising out of the old.The congregation had heard it often before.But there was a wonderful hat, a combination of sweet peas and lavender, in the sixth pew from the pulpit.It attracted much attention."
"做完礼拜后，丹尼在拐角处徘徊，这时凯蒂在一旁等他，天蓝色的眼睛里透着不悦。","After church Danny lingered on a corner while Katy waited, with pique in her sky-blue eyes."
"“你跟我一起回家么？”她问，“倒不用担心我，我自己也会安全到家的。你看起来好像特别担心什么。好吧。我还能在那个特殊的时间见到你吗，麦克里先生？”","“Are you coming along to the house?” she asked.“But don’t mind me.I’ll get there all right.You seem to be loriae’ a lot about something.All right.Will I see you at any time specially, Mr. McCree?”"
"“我会跟往常一样在周三晚上过去的。”丹尼说着转身穿过马路。","“I’ll be around Wednesday night as usual,” said Danny, turning and crossing the street."
"凯蒂扭头就走，帽子上的绿玫瑰愤怒地颤动着。丹尼走了两个街区后停了下来。他一动不动地站在人行道旁的拐角处，两手揣在兜里。他面无表情，跟石头雕像一样。在他的灵魂深处似乎有什么东西在搅动，如此微小、如此精细、如此纤巧，在发酵，而他那僵硬的神经都感觉不到。那比四月的阳光更柔和，比感官的呼叫更微妙，比那个女人的爱更纯洁、更根深蒂固——因为他不是已经避开了绿玫瑰和那双牢牢迷了他一年的眼睛了吗？丹尼不知道那是什么。其实那个急于回家享受大餐的牧师已经告诉他了。可是牧师讲的像催眠曲一样，让人昏昏欲睡，丹尼也没有类似剧本歌词的东西让他一直跟着认真听。但牧师说出了真相。","Katy walked away with the green roses dangling indignantly.Danny stopped two blocks away.He stood still with his hands in his pockets, at the curb on the corner.His face was that of a graven image.Deep in his soul something stirred so small, so fine, so keen and leavening that his hard fibres did not recognize it.It was something more tender than the April day, more subtle than the call of the senses, purer and deeper-rooted than the love of woman—for had he not turned away from green roses and eyes that had kept him chained for a year?And Danny did not know what it was.The preacher, who was in a hurry to go to his dinner, had told him, but Danny had had no libretto with which to follow the drowsy intonation.But the preacher spoke the truth."
"突然，丹尼拍了一下自己的大腿，用沙哑的嗓子高兴地叫了一声。","Suddenly Danny slapped his leg and gave forth a hoarse yell of delight."
"“希伯伯托马斯！”他冲着高架路的支柱喊，“哎呀，无用地猜想有什么意义呢？真该死！我现在知道他的意思了。","“Hippopotamus!” he shouted to an elevated road pillar.“Well, how is that for a bum guess?Why, blast my skylights!I know what he was driving at now."
"“希伯伯托马斯！那不是很可笑嘛！他一年前听说的；不过好长时间没读了，他竟然还有印象。我们读到公元前469年就停下来了，再没往下读过。哎呀，一个木头人是猜不到他想说什么的。”","“Hippopotamus!Wouldn’t that send you to the Bronx!It’s been a year since he heard it; and he didn’t miss it so very far.We quit at 469 B. C., and this comes next.Well, a wooden man wouldn’t have guessed what he was trying to get out of him.”"
"丹尼坐上跨城汽车，回到了自己挣钱付房租的公寓。","Danny caught a crosstown car and went up to the rear flat that his labor supported."
"老麦克里还在窗户旁边坐着。他那熄灭的烟斗放在窗台上。","Old man McCree was still sitting by the window.His extinct pipe lay on the sill."
"“是你吗，孩子？”他问。","“Will that be you, lad?” he asked."
"丹尼刚想做件好事，但像是被人发现了，他突然很生气。","Danny flared into the rage of a strong man who is surprised at the outset of committing a good deed."
"“这个家谁付房租，谁买吃的？”他恶狠狠地说，“难道我没有权利进来吗？”","“Who pays the rent and buys the food that is eaten in this house?” he snapped, viciously.“Have I no right to come in?”"
"“你是一个忠诚的孩子，”老麦克里叹息说，“已经是晚上了吗？”","“Ye’re a faithful lad,” said old man McCree, with a sigh.“Is it evening yet?”"
"丹尼伸手从书架上拿下一本烫金字体标记的厚书——《希腊历史》。上面的灰尘有半英寸厚。他把书放在桌上，找到那个书签标记的地方。然后他以最大的声音急促地叫道：","Danny reached up on a shelf and took down a thick book labeled in gilt letters, “The History of Greece.”Dust was on it half an inch thick.He laid it on the table and found a place in it marked by a strip of paper.And then he gave a short roar at the top of his voice, and said: "
"“你是想让别人给你读有关希伯伯托马斯的故事，对吗？”","“Was it the hippopotamus you wanted to be read to about then?”"
"“我没听到你打开书本啊？”老麦克里说，“孩子啊，你给我读了这本书上的故事之后，好几个月过去了，我一直感到厌烦。不知道为什么，我倒是特别喜欢希腊人了。但上次你没读完就停下来了。外面天气不错，孩子。出去走走，工作累了休息休息。我已经习惯坐在窗口抽烟斗了。”","“Did I hear ye open the book?” said old man McCree.“Many and weary be the months since my lad has read it to me.I dinno; but I took a great likings to them Greeks.Ye left off at a place.’Tis a fine day outside, lad.Be out and take rest from your work.I have gotten used to me chair by the windy and me pipe.”"
"“伯——伯罗奔尼撒半岛是我们停下来的地方，不是希伯伯托马斯，”丹尼说，“战争在那里开始。大概持续了三十年。标题说一个来自马其顿王国，名为菲利普的人，在公元前338年时的谢——谢隆纳战争中成为希腊的首领。我读给你听。”","“Pel-Peloponnesus was the place where we left off, and not hippopotamus,” said Danny.“The war began there.It kept something doing for thirty years.The headlines says that a guy named Philip of Macedon, in 338 B. C., got to be boss of Greece by getting the decision at the battle of Cher-Cheronoea.I’ll read it.”"
"老麦克里用手拢着耳朵支着头，坐在那里，聚精会神地听了一个小时的伯罗奔尼撒战争。","With his hand to his ear, rapt in the Peloponnesian War, old man McCree sat for an hour, listening."
"然后他站起来，摸索着走到厨房门前。麦克里太太正在切冻肉。她抬起头，看到眼泪正从老麦克里的眼睛里淌出。","Then he got up and felt his way to the door of the kitchen.Mrs. McCree was slicing cold meat.She looked up.Tears were running from old man McCree’s eyes."
"“你听到我们的儿子给我读书了吗？”他说，“在这世上没有比他更好的人了。我的两只眼睛又回来了。”","“Do you hear our lad loria’ to me?” he said.“There is none finer in the land.My two eyes have come back to me again.”"
"晚饭后，他对丹尼说：“今年的复活节过得真开心。晚上你出去见凯蒂吧。今天过得够好了。”","After supper he said to Danny: “’Tis a happy day, this Easter.And now ye will be off to see Katy in the evening.Well enough.”"
"“这个家谁付房租，谁买吃的？”丹尼生气地说，“难道我没有权利呆在家里吗？晚饭后还要读公元前146年的科林斯战争，就是书上所说的，希腊王国完——完全成为罗马帝国一部分的时候。难道我在家里什么都不是吗？”","“Who pays the rent and buys the food that is eaten in this house?” said Danny, angrily.“Have I no right to stay in it?After supper there is yet to come the reading of the battle of Corinth, 146 B. C., when the kingdom, as they say, became an in-integral portion of the Roman Empire.Am I nothing in this house?”"
