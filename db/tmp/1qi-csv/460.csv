"咖啡馆里的世界公民","A Cosmopolite in a Cafe"
"作者：欧·亨利","by O. Henry"
"午夜时分，咖啡馆挤满了人。不知何故，我所坐的桌子不为人关注，还有两把空着的椅子张开双臂，以诱人的殷勤迎接着涌入的客流。","At midnight the cafe was crowded.By some chance the little table at which I sat had escaped the eye of incomers, and two vacant chairs at it extended their arms with venal hospitality to the influx of patrons."
"当时，有一位世界公民坐上了其中一把椅子，我很开心，因为我以前有这样一个观念，觉得自亚当以来就没有存在过什么真正的世界公民。我们听说过世界公民，还在许多行李上见过异国的标签，但我们只是碰到了旅行者，而非世界公民。","And then a cosmopolite sat in one of them, and I was glad, for I held a theory that since Adam no true citizen of the world has existed.We hear of them, and we see foreign labels on much luggage, but we find travellers instead of cosmopolites."
"我想请你对下面这种场景加以思索——大理石面的桌子，几排倚墙而立的皮饰座椅，愉悦的同伴，身着半正式礼服的女士们正异口同声，高谈阔论着品味、经济、财富或艺术，服务周到且爱慕赏赐的侍者；乐曲很机智地满足着每个人的口味，却让作曲家们手忙脚乱，交谈声和欢笑声混为一片——如果你愿意，盛满维尔茨堡酒的锥形酒杯将在你的唇前鞠躬，如同那枝头熟透的樱桃摇摆到强盗般的松鸦口中一样。有一位来自英奇·丘恩克的雕塑家曾经告诉我，这种场景的确具有巴黎风格。","I invoke your consideration of the scene—the marble-topped tables, the range of leather-upholstered wall seats, the gay company, the ladies dressed in demi-state toilets, speaking in an exquisite visible chorus of taste, economy, opulence or art; the sedulous and largess-loving garcons, the music wisely catering to all with its raids upon the composers; the melange of talk and laughter—and, if you will, the Wurzburger in the tall glass cones that bend to your lips as a ripe cherry sways on its branch to the beak of a robber jay.I was told by a sculptor from Mauch Chunk that the scene was truly Parisian."
"我身旁的这位世界公民名叫E. 拉什莫尔·科格兰，他明年夏季将从科尼岛来信。他告诉我，他打算在那里建造一个新的“娱乐胜地”，提供国王级别的娱乐享受。接着，他的谈话就沿着经纬线的平行圈展开了。可以这样说，他把整个巨大的、圆圆的地球放进他的手心，了如指掌却不屑一顾。世界就仿佛和配有葡萄柚的套餐中的黑樱桃果核一般大小。他带着不敬的口吻谈到了赤道，话题又从一块大陆跳到了另一块大陆，他讥笑着那些气候带，在用餐巾抹嘴间，又把公海描述得不值一提。他挥了下手，提到了位于印度海得拉巴的某一个集市。呼！他会让你在拉普兰滑雪。嗖！现在你在凯阿莱卡希基海滩和当地的夏威夷人一起冲浪。顷刻！他拽着你穿过阿肯色州生长着星毛栎的湿润沼泽，又让你在爱达荷州那碱性土壤的牧场上晾干一会，旋即绕进维也纳大公们的上流社会。之后，他会给你讲他在芝加哥湖畔吹凉风感冒的一次经历，以及一位年长的埃斯卡米拉人又是怎样在布宜诺斯艾利斯用丘丘拉草药熬的热汤剂把他治好的。你若将一封信的地址写为“宇宙太阳系地球E. 拉什莫尔·科格兰先生收”，你大可放心信会抵达他的手中。","My cosmopolite was named E. Rushmore Coglan, and he will be heard from next summer at Coney Island.He is to establish a new “attraction” there, he informed me, offering kingly diversion.And then his conversation rang along parallels of latitude and longitude.He took the great, round world in his hand, so to speak, familiarly, contemptuously, and it seemed no larger than the seed of a Maraschino cherry in a table d’hote grape fruit.He spoke disrespectfully of the equator, he skipped from continent to continent, he derided the zones, he mopped up the high seas with his napkin.With a wave of his hand he would speak of a certain bazaar in Hyderabad.Whiff!He would have you on skis in Lapland.Zip!Now you rode the breakers with the Kanakas at Kealaikahiki.Presto!He dragged you through an Arkansas post-oak swamp, let you dry for a moment on the alkali plains of his Idaho ranch, then whirled you into the society of Viennese archdukes.Anon he would be telling you of a cold he acquired in a Chicago lake breeze and how old Escamila cured it in Buenos Ayres with a hot infusion of the chuchula weed.You would have addressed a letter to “E. Rushmore Coglan, Esq., the Earth, Solar System, the Universe,” and have mailed it, feeling confident that it would be delivered to him."
"当时，我对自己发现了人类自亚当以来第一个真正的世界公民确定不疑，我聆听着他关于整个世界的高谈阔论，生怕自己会发现他只是带有环球旅行者的地方口音。但是他的见解从来没飘忽不定或令人失望，他对不同城市、不同国家和不同大洲，就像风或像万有引力那般公正自然。就在E. 拉什莫尔·科格兰对这个小小星球阔谈不止之时，我兴奋地记起了一位伟大的准世界公民，他为全世界写作，并把自己奉献给了孟买。在一首诗中，他不得不写出地球上各城市间存在的傲慢与对抗，“城市孕育的这些人，他们熙熙攘攘地穿梭，却只能依附于各自城市的边缘，犹如孩子偎依在母亲的长袍中一样。”每当他们走过“ 喧嚣又陌生的街道”，他们就会记得故乡城市有“多么忠诚、多么愚蠢、多么可人”，这使故土的名字与他们的名字紧紧联系在一起。我一下兴奋了起来，因为我已抓住了吉卜林的小辫子。就在这里，我已找到了一位不是泥土造就的凡人，他不会狭隘地吹嘘自己的故乡或国家，如果他真是在吹捧，那也是在赞颂他的整个地球，反对那些火星人和月球居民。","I was sure that I had found at last the one true cosmopolite since Adam, and I listened to his worldwide discourse fearful lest I should discover in it the local note of the mere globe-trotter.But his opinions never fluttered or drooped; he was as impartial to cities, countries and continents as the winds or gravitation.And as E. Rushmore Coglan prattled of this little planet I thought with glee of a great almost-cosmopolite who wrote for the whole world and dedicated himself to Bombay.In a poem he has to say that there is pride and rivalry between the cities of the earth, and that “the men that breed from them, they traffic up and down, but cling to their cities’ hem as a child to the mother’s gown.”And whenever they walk “by roaring streets unknown” they remember their native city “most faithful, foolish, fond; making her mere-breathed name their bond upon their bond.”And my glee was roused because I had caught Mr. Kipling napping.Here I had found a man not made from dust; one who had no narrow boasts of birthplace or country, one who, if he bragged at all, would brag of his whole round globe against the Martians and the inhabitants of the Moon."
"在这些问题上的见解是那位坐在我桌旁第三个拐角处的E. 拉什莫尔·科格兰陡然抛出来的。正当科格兰给我描述西伯利亚铁路沿线的地形时，管弦乐队转到了集成曲的演奏。演出的结束曲目是《迪克西》，随着令人振奋的乐浪的加强，音乐几乎淹没在每张桌旁人们的掌声中。","Expression on these subjects was precipitated from E. Rushmore Coglan by the third corner to our table.While Coglan was describing to me the topography along the Siberian Railway the orchestra glided into a medley.The concluding air was “Dixie,” and as the exhilarating notes tumbled forth they were almost overpowered by a great clapping of hands from almost every table."
"每个夜幕下，在纽约城中无数的咖啡馆里，如此引人注目的场面随处可见，花一个段落的笔墨来书写是值得的。用不着种种理论，一吨吨被喝掉的酒就是对此最好的解释。有些人曾轻率地认为，一旦夜幕降临，城里所有的南方人都会匆匆赶往咖啡馆。身处北方城市来赞颂这种“反叛”格调的确有些让人费解，不过这倒并非解释不通。与西班牙的战事，多年来薄荷和西瓜等作物的丰收，新奥尔良跑道上侥幸获胜的参赛者，以及由印第安纳州居民和堪萨斯州居民组成的“北卡罗来纳州社团”举办的盛宴，这一切都使得南方在曼哈顿成为一种“时尚”。美甲师会口齿不清地柔声说道，你的左手食指让她想起一位来自弗吉尼亚州里士满市的绅士。","It is worth a paragraph to say that this remarkable scene can be witnessed every evening in numerous cafes in the City of New York.Tons of brew have been consumed over theories to account for it.Some have conjectured hastily that all Southerners in town hie themselves to cafes at nightfall.This applause of the “rebel” air in a Northern city does puzzle a little; but it is not insolvable.The war with Spain, many years’ generous mint and watermelon crops, a few long-shot winners at the New Orleans race-track, and the brilliant banquets given by the Indiana and Kansas citizens who compose the North Carolina Society have made the South rather a “fad” in Manhattan.Your manicure will lisp softly that your left forefinger reminds her so much of a gentleman’s in Richmond, Va.Oh, certainly; but many a lady has to work now—the war, you know."
"正当演奏着《迪克西》的时候，有一位黑发青年不知从什么地方跳了出来，发出莫斯比游击队队员似的吼叫声，疯狂地挥动着他那顶软沿帽。然后他绕过了烟雾，坐进我们桌旁的空位上，掏出烟来。","When “Dixie” was being played a dark-haired young man sprang up from somewhere with a Mosby guerrilla yell and waved frantically his soft-brimmed hat.Then he strayed through the smoke, dropped into the vacant chair at our table and pulled out cigarettes."
"这夜晚到了打破缄默的时候了。我们中的一位跟侍者点了三杯维尔茨堡酒，那位黑发青年笑了笑，点点头，意会到那三杯中有他一杯。我赶紧问了他一个问题，因为我想证实我的一个理论。","The evening was at the period when reserve is thawed.One of us mentioned three Wurzburgers to the waiter; the dark-haired young man acknowledged his inclusion in the order by a smile and a nod.I hastened to ask him a question because I wanted to try out a theory I had."
"“您介不介意告诉我，您是来自……”我开口问道。","“Would you mind telling me,” I began, “whether you are from—”"
"E. 拉什莫尔·科格兰的拳头砰的一声砸到了桌上，我不安地陷入了沉默。","The fist of E. Rushmore Coglan banged the table and I was jarred into silence."
"“对不起，”他说，“不过我从来不喜欢听到有人问这个问题。一个人从哪里来重要吗？以通讯地址来评判一个人合理吗？嗯，我见过厌恶威士忌的肯塔基人，见过不是波卡洪塔斯后裔的弗吉尼亚人，见过没写过一部小说的印第安人，见过不穿裤缝钉有银元的丝绒裤的墨西哥人，见过有趣的英国人，见过挥金如土的北方人，见过冷若冰霜的南方人，也见过心胸狭窄的西部人，还见过忙忙碌碌的纽约人，忙碌到不会驻足街上，花一个小时观看独臂杂货店店员用纸袋包装越橘。人就是人，不必给人贴上任何地域的标签来制造障碍。”","“Excuse me,” said he, “but that’s a question I never like to hear asked.What does it matter where a man is from?Is it fair to judge a man by his post-office address?Why, I’ve seen Kentuckians who hated whiskey, Virginians who weren’t descended from Pocahontas, Indianians who hadn’t written a novel, Mexicans who didn’t wear velvet trousers with silver dollars sewed along the seams, funny Englishmen, spendthrift Yankees, cold-blooded Southerners, narrow-minded Westerners, and New Yorkers who were too busy to stop for an hour on the street to watch a one-armed grocer’s clerk do up cranberries in paper bags.Let a man be a man and don’t handicap him with the label of any section.”"
"“请原谅，”我说，“不过我的好奇并非完全出自无聊。我熟悉南方地区，当乐队一演奏起《迪克西》时，我就喜欢观察。我认定那位故作忠于南方又特别卖劲地给这支乐曲喝彩的人，一定是来自新泽西州的塞考卡，要么就是来自本市默里山大剧院与哈莱姆河之间的某地。我正打算询问这位绅士以检验我的理论，突然被你的理论打断了——我得承认，你的理论比我的更有远见。”","“Pardon me,” I said, “but my curiosity was not altogether an idle one.I know the South, and when the band plays ‘Dixie’ I like to observe.I have formed the belief that the man who applauds that air with special violence and ostensible sectional loyalty is invariably a native of either Secaucus, N.J., or the district between Murray Hill Lyceum and the Harlem River, this city.I was about to put my opinion to the test by inquiring of this gentleman when you interrupted with your own—larger theory, I must confess.”"
"此时，那位黑头发的年轻人和我攀谈了起来，很显然，他也是按照自己那老一套的习惯来思考的。","And now the dark-haired young man spoke to me, and it became evident that his mind also moved along its own set of grooves."
"“我倒想变成一朵长春花，”他神秘地说，“高高地站立在山谷之巅，吟唱陶拉鲁——拉鲁的曲调。”","“I should like to be a periwinkle,” said he, mysteriously, “on the top of a valley, and sing tooralloo-ralloo.”"
"这显然太过于让人费解，于是我又一次转向了科格兰。","This was clearly too obscure, so I turned again to Coglan."
"“我周游世界都十二次了。”他说。“我知道有一位乌佩纳维克的爱斯基摩人派人去辛辛那提买领带，我还看到过一位乌拉圭的牧羊人在巴特尔克里克举行的早餐食品猜谜游戏上获了奖。在埃及开罗和日本横滨，我全年都各租有一间房。上海的一家茶楼已为我预备好了拖鞋，随时恭候我的到来，我也不必告诉里约热内卢和西雅图的人如何帮我煮蛋。这是一个伟大而渺小的旧世界。吹嘘自己来自北方，或来自南方，或来自山谷的老别墅，或来自克利夫兰市的欧几里德大街，或来自派克斯峰，或来自弗吉尼亚州费尔法克斯郡，或来自恶少公寓，或来自任何其他地方又有什么用呢？只有当我们仅仅因为恰巧降生在那里而摒弃了对污浊的城市、十英亩大小的沼泽的那些愚蠢的观念，这个世界才会更美好。","“I’ve been around the world twelve times,” said he.“I know an Esquimau in Upernavik who sends to Cincinnati for his neckties, and I saw a goatherder in Uruguay who won a prize in a Battle Creek breakfast food puzzle competition.I pay rent on a room in Cairo, Egypt, and another in Yokohama all the year around.I’ve got slippers waiting for me in a tea-house in Shanghai, and I don’t have to tell ‘em how to cook my eggs in Rio de Janeiro or Seattle.It’s a mighty little old world.What’s the use of bragging about being from the North, or the South, or the old manor house in the dale, or Euclid avenue, Cleveland, or Pike’s Peak, or Fairfax County, Va., or Hooligan’s Flats or any place?It’ll be a better world when we quit being fools about some mildewed town or ten acres of swampland just because we happened to be born there.”"
"“看来你是个真正的世界公民。”我钦慕地说道。“但你似乎也诋毁了爱国精神。”","“You seem to be a genuine cosmopolite,” I said admiringly.“But it also seems that you would decry patriotism.”"
"“爱国精神是石器时代的遗俗。”科格兰温和地说。“我们都是同胞——不管是中国人、英国人、祖鲁人、巴塔哥尼亚人，还是在考河湾居住的人。总有一天，所有因自己所处的城市、州、地区或国家而滋生的狭隘的自豪感将消失殆尽，那时我们都将成为世界公民，而且理应如此。”","“A relic of the stone age,” declared Coglan, warmly.“We are all brothers—Chinamen, Englishmen, Zulus, Patagonians and the people in the bend of the Kaw River.Some day all this petty pride in one’s city or State or section or country will be wiped out, and we’ll all be citizens of the world, as we ought to be.”"
"“不过，当你游走在异国他乡的时候，”我坚持说，“难道你的思想不会回到某地——某个热爱的和——”","“But while you are wandering in foreign lands,” I persisted, “do not your thoughts revert to some spo—some dear and—”"
"“从来没有这样一个地方。”E. 拉什莫尔·科格兰轻蔑地打断了我的话。“这个被称为地球的、有着陆地且两极略扁的球状大行星体，就是我的住所。在国外，我遇到过许许多多被各种东西束缚住的地球公民。月夜之下，我见过一些芝加哥人坐在威尼斯的凤尾船上，大赞自己的排水渠道。我还见过一位南方人，在他被引荐给英格兰国王时，曾不假思索地把他母亲方的一位姑婆与查尔斯顿的珀金斯家联姻的消息报告给了国王。我知道有一个纽约人，曾遭到几名想索取赎金的阿富汗绑匪的劫持。在他的人把赎金送过去之后，他才与中间人一道返回喀布尔。‘阿富汗？’当地人通过翻译向他说道。‘哦，不是很慢，你觉得呢？’‘嗨，我哪里知道。’他说，然后他就开始给他们讲述起第六大道和百老汇的一位出租车司机的事情来。我对这些毫无兴趣。我不会把自己局限在任何直径不足八千英里的地方。只需记下我的名字，E. 拉什莫尔·科格兰，一个世界公民。”","“Nary a spot,” interrupted E. R. Coglan, flippantly.“The terrestrial, globular, planetary hunk of matter, slightly flattened at the poles, and known as the Earth, is my abode.I’ve met a good many object-bound citizens of this country abroad.I’ve seen men from Chicago sit in a gondola in Venice on a moonlight night and brag about their drainage canal.I’ve seen a Southerner on being introduced to the King of England hand that monarch, without batting his eyes, the information that his grandaunt on his mother’s side was related by marriage to the Perkinses, of Charleston.I knew a New Yorker who was kidnapped for ransom by some Afghanistan bandits.His people sent over the money and he came back to Kabul with the agent.‘Afghanistan?’ the natives said to him through an interpreter.‘Well, not so slow, do you think?’‘Oh, I don’t know,’ says he, and he begins to tell them about a cab driver at Sixth avenue and Broadway.Those ideas don’t suit me.I’m not tied down to anything that isn’t 8,000 miles in diameter.Just put me down as E. Rushmore Coglan, citizen of the terrestrial sphere.”"
"说完，他向我郑重道别，然后离去，原因是他认为透过闲谈声，他在烟雾中看到了什么熟人。于是，就剩下我和那位渴望成为长春花的人了，不过他已俯首于维尔茨堡酒樽前，再也无力放言他在谷顶吟唱曲调的豪情壮志了。","My cosmopolite made a large adieu and left me, for he thought he saw some one through the chatter and smoke whom he knew.So I was left with the would-be periwinkle, who was reduced to Wurzburger without further ability to voice his aspirations to perch, melodious, upon the summit of a valley."
"我静坐着，回想着这位真真切切的世界公民，疑惑着那位诗人为何就把他给遗漏了。他是我发现的，我相信他。这是什么缘故呢？“城市孕育的这些人，他们熙熙攘攘地穿梭，却只能依附于各自城市的边缘，犹如孩子偎依在母亲的长袍上一样。”","I sat reflecting upon my evident cosmopolite and wondering how the poet had managed to miss him.He was my discovery and I believed in him.How was it?“The men that breed from them they traffic up and down, but cling to their cities’ hem as a child to the mother’s gown.”"
"但Ｅ. 拉什莫尔·科格兰并非如此。整个世界都是他的——","Not so E. Rushmore Coglan.With the whole world for his—"
"咖啡馆的另一边起了争执，传来巨大的喧闹声，切断了我的思绪。我从就座的客人们的头顶望去，远远看到E. 拉什莫尔·科格兰和一个陌生人激烈地扭打在一起。他们就像泰坦一样在桌子之间来回打斗，酒杯纷纷被砸碎，其他人刚抓起他们的帽子便又被撞倒在地，一位黑发女郎惊声尖叫，而另一位金发女郎开始哼唱起《取笑》。","My meditations were interrupted by a tremendous noise and conflict in another part of the cafe.I saw above the heads of the seated patrons E. Rushmore Coglan and a stranger to me engaged in terrific battle.They fought between the tables like Titans, and glasses crashed, and men caught their hats up and were knocked down, and a brunette screamed, and a blonde began to sing “Teasing.”"
"我认识的这位世界公民依然保持着地球带给他的荣耀和名誉，就在此时，侍者们摆开了有名的楔形推进队形，插入他们二人之间，并将其推出了咖啡馆，尽管他俩仍在反抗。","My cosmopolite was sustaining the pride and reputation of the Earth when the waiters closed in on both combatants with their famous flying wedge formation and bore them outside, still resisting."
"我叫住一位名叫麦卡锡的法国侍者，询问冲突的缘由。","I called McCarthy, one of the French garcons, and asked him the cause of the conflict."
"“那位打着红色领带的人”(就是我认识的那位世界公民)，他说，“他恼怒的原因是另一个人说到了他家乡那糟糕的人行道和供水状况。”","“The man with the red tie” (that was my cosmopolite), said he, “got hot on account of things said about the bum sidewalks and water supply of the place he come from by the other guy.”"
"“可是，”我诧异地问，“他是一位四海为家的人——一位世界公民。他——”","“Why,” said I, bewildered, “that man is a citizen of the world—a cosmopolite.He—”"
"“他说他本是缅因州马特沃姆凯格人，”麦卡锡继续解释道，“而他不能忍受不去说这个地方的坏话。”","“Originally from Mattawamkeag, Maine, he said,” continued McCarthy, “and he wouldn’t stand for no knockin’ the place.”"
