"序","Preface"
"这本书是我近四十年前开始写的，因为事务冗忙，时作时辍。原来计划，除现在的五章外，还有三章是有关中国与外国佛教关系史的，因佛教协会已有这方面资料的编辑和著作，所以不重复了。","I began to write this book almost forty years ago. Owing to the heavy load of work, I could only write intermittently. In addition to the five chapters as they appear now, I intended to write three more chapters dealing with the history of relations between China and other countries in the Buddhist sphere. Since the Buddhist Association of China has undertaken to compile materials and write on this topic, there is no need to duplicate their work here."
"我写成第一章后，曾以楞严经“如人饮水，冷暖自知”这句话用“饮水”的笔名陆续在《现代佛学》杂志上发表。有一位朋友问我：“你为什么用这样一个小题目？”我说：“我喜欢‘小题大做’,而不愿‘大题小做’，更害怕‘有题空做’。”这本书名很合我的心意。","When I finished writing the first chapter, it was published in installments in the *Journal of Modern Buddhism*. I used the pseudonym, “Yin Shui” (drink water), derived from the text *Śūram gama Sūtra* that reads “One perceives whether the water is cold or warm only when one drinks it.” A friend of mine asked why I chose such an insignificant title. I replied, “I prefer to make a fuss about trifles rather than underplaying a big issue, not to mention completely ignoring significant subjects.” The title of this book is in conformity with my wish."
"几年前，一位青年僧人用日文翻译这本书，我应他的要求写序时，曾记下与本书有关的一件事：1957年我陪一位柬埔寨僧人见毛泽东主席，客人未到之前，我先到了，毛主席便和我漫谈。他问：“佛教有这么一个公式——赵朴初，即非赵朴初，是名赵朴初，有没有这个公式呀？”我说：“有。”主席再问：“为什么？先肯定，后否定？”我说：“不是先肯定，后否定，而是同时肯定，同时否定。”谈到这里，客人到了，没有能谈下去。后来，我在写这本书的第二章时，想起这一次未谈完的问答，我想，书中谈到缘起性空的思想，可能补充了当时我在毛主席面前所想讲的话。","A few years ago a young monk translated my book into Japanese. In the preface, which I wrote at his request, I referred to a story connected with the subject of this book. In 1957, I accompanied a Cambodian monk on a visit to Chairman Mao Zedong. Before the guest arrived I had the opportunity to chat with the Chairman. He told me, “There is a formula in Buddhism: Zhao Puchu is not Zhao Puchu (in the sense of Paramattha), but Zhao Puchu by name. Is this true?” “Yes.” I replied. He added, “Why, then, do you affirm it before negating it?” “It is not affirmation before negation,” I said, “but simultaneous affirmation and negation.” Then the guest arrived and the conversation was interrupted. Later when I worked on Chapter II of this book, I recalled that unfinished talk. I think the idea of the voidness of nature because of Dependent Origination (Paticcasamuppāda) in the book might constitute what I would have said to the Chairman at that time. "
"我曾看到一本毛主席的勤务员李银桥写的书。有一天，毛主席在延安出门散步，毛主席对李银桥说：“我们去看看佛教寺庙，好不好？”李银桥说：“那有什么看头？都是一些迷信。”毛主席说：“片面片面，那是文化。”我因而想起“文化大革命”结束后，周建人先生写信给我说：“文革”初期范文澜先生向他说，自己正在补课，读佛书。范老说，佛教在中国将近两千年，对中国文化有那么深厚的关系，不懂佛教，就不能懂得中国文化史。1987年，我到四川一个佛教名胜地方看到被人贴迷信标语的事实，回来写了一份报告，钱学森博士看见了，写信给我说：“宗教是文化。”","I have read a book written by Li Yinqiao, one of Chairman Mao’sbodyguards. According to this book, when Chairman Mao was taking a walk with Li in Yan’an one day, Mao said to him, “Let’s go see a Buddhist temple, shall we?” Li said, “What’s the point? It is nothing but a symbol of superstition.” “One-sided, one-sided your thinking is. It is culture.” This also reminds me of a letter to me from Mr. Zhou Jianren after “the Cultural Revolution”, in which he told me that in the early period of the turmoil, Mr. Fan Wenlan had sent word to him that he was making up for a missed lesson by reading Buddhist books. Fan said that Buddhism in China has lasted about twenty centuries, and that it had such a profound influence on Chinese culture that one can hardly understand the cultural history of China without some knowledge of Buddhism. Finally, in 1987, I visited a Buddhist historical site in Sichuan Province and found that anti-superstition slogans were visible everywhere. Therefore, on my return, I wrote a report. After reading the report Dr. Qian Xuesen wrote to me, “Religion is a part of culture”."
"这三个人，一是伟大的革命家，一是著名的历史学家，一是当代的大科学家，所见相同，都承认佛教是文化，而今天还有不少人的认识水平和当年李银桥的一样。","It is noteworthy that all three of these men, the first, a great revolutionary, the second, a famous historian, and the third, a great contemporary scientist, shared the same view that Buddhism is a part of culture. Yet there are still many people today whose perception remains like that of Li Yinqiao at that time."
"我最初写这本书的动机只是为了和外国朋友谈话时，翻译人员因缺乏佛教知识而感到困难，想为他们提供一些方便。但这许多年来，得到国内不少人的关怀、鼓励，也得到一些外国朋友的注意。事实说明，这一本小书对于增进人们对佛教的了解，增进国际朋友对中国佛教的了解，不无少许贡献。","At the very beginning, I was impelled to write this book by the desire to help those interpreters who had difficulty in performing their work due to a lack of knowledge in Buddhism. In recent years, however, I have received kindly consideration and encouragement from many people at home as well as friends from abroad. This indicates that this pamphlet has made more than a negligible contribution towards enhancing the public comprehension of Buddhism and helping foreigners understand Chinese Buddhism."
"我感谢译者为此书所付出的宝贵的心力。我虔诚期待国际朋友对于此书内容给予指教。","I am indebted to the translator for her arduous endeavors in accomplishing this task. I sincerely look forward to forthcoming comments on the book from friends all over the world."

"佛陀和佛教的创立","THE BUDDHA AND THE ORIGIN OF BUDDHISM"
"**问**：什么是佛教？","**Q:** What is Buddhism?"
"**答**：佛教，广义地说，它是一种宗教，包括它的经典、仪式、习惯、教团的组织等等；狭义地说，它就是佛所说的言教；如果用佛教固有的术语来说，应当叫做佛法（Buddha Dhamma）。","**A:** Buddhism, in a general sense, is a religion with its canonical literature, rites, customs, Sangha Order (congregational organization) etc.; more specifically, it is the Buddha’s teachings, and with this specific meaning it should be termed the Buddha Dhamma."
"**问**：“法”是什么意思？","**Q:** What is “Dhamma”?"
"**答**：“法”字的梵语是达磨（Dharma）。佛教对这个字的解释是：“任持自性、轨生物解。”这就是说，每一事物必然保持它自己特有的性质和相状，有它一定轨则，使人看到便可以了解是何物。例如水，它保持着它的湿性，它有水的一定轨则，使人一见便生起水的了解；反过来说，如果一件东西没有湿性，它的轨则不同于水的轨则，便不能生起水的了解。所以佛教把一切事物都叫做“法”。佛经中常见到的“一切法”、“诸法”字样，就是“一切事物”或“宇宙万有”的意思。照佛教的解释，佛根据自己对一切法如实的了解而宣示出来的言教，它本身也同样具有“任持自性、轨生物解”的作用，所以也叫做法。","**A:** “Dharma” in Sanskrit (“Dhamma” in Pāli) means “retaining one’s own nature, so that it can be recognized”. That is to say, everything has its own attributes and appearance (S. prakrti and laksana, P. pakati and lakkhana) and maintains its own properties, by which people can perceive it as what it is. For instance, water maintains its property of wetness and acts according to its fixed track, so people recognize it as water when they see it. Conversely, when something is devoid of wetness and obey different rules from water, there then can be no conception of water. Therefore, Buddhism views everything as “dhamma”. The terms “all dhammas”, “each dhamma” appearing in Buddhist canons indicate “all things” or “universal existence”. According to this interpretation, the discourses delivered by the Buddha based on his own empirical comprehension of dhammas are also “Dhamma” since they hold true to the principle of “retaining its own nature, so that it can be recognized.”"
"**问**：佛是神吗？","**Q:** Is the Buddha a deity?"
"**答**：不，佛不是神。他是公元前六世纪时代的人，有名有姓，他的名字是悉达多（S. Siddhārtha, P. Siddhattha），他的姓是乔达摩（ S. Gautama, P. Gotama）。因为他属于释迦（Sākya）族，人们又称他为释迦牟尼，意思是释迦族的圣人。","**A:** No, the Buddha is not a deity. He was a man who lived in the 6th century BC. He had his own given and family names, his given name being Siddhattha (S. Siddhārtha) and his family name Gotama (S. Gautama). As he belonged to the Sākya clan, people also called him Sākyamuni, meaning a sage of the Sākyas."
"**问**：为什么称他为佛呢？佛的意义是什么？","**Q:** Why is the Buddha called “Fo” in Chinese? What does it mean?"
"**答**：“佛”字是“佛陀”的简称，是Buddha的音译（如果用今天的汉语音译，应当是“布达”），佛陀的意义是“觉者”或“智者”。“佛陀”是印度早就有了的字，但佛教给它加了三种涵义：（1）正觉（对一切法的性质相状，无增无减地、如实地觉了）；（2）等觉或遍觉（不仅自觉，即自己觉悟，而且能平等普遍地觉他，即使别人觉悟）；（3）圆觉或无上觉（自觉觉他的智慧和功行都已达到最高的、最圆满的境地）。","**A:** “Fo” is the abbreviation for “Fotuo” which was used to translate the word “Buddha”. (The characters used for “Fotuo” were pronounced “buda” at the time of translation.) Buddha means “an enlightened one” or “an awakened one”. The term “Buddha” existed in India from the earliest times, but Buddhism has attributed three additional connotations to the term. They are as follows: (1) enlightenment (Sambodhi, which means thoroughly realizing the properties and appearance of all dhammas as they are); (2) perfect enlightenment (Sammā-sambodhi, which means not only enlightening oneself but also equally and universally enlightening others); (3) supreme or paramount enlightenment (Anuttara sammāsambodhi, which means one’s wisdom and achievement have reached the highest and the most perfect sphere in enlightening both oneself and others)."
"**问**：除释迦牟尼外，有没有另外的佛？","**Q:** Are there any other Buddhas besides Sākyamuni?"
"**答**：佛教认为过去有人成佛，未来也会有人成佛，一切人都有得到觉悟的可能性，所以说：“一切众生，皆有佛性，有佛性者，皆得成佛。”","**A:** Buddhism claims that there were people who attained Buddhahood in the past, and there will be people to become Buddhas in the future. It is possible for everybody to achieve enlightenment. Therefore, “All living beings have the Buddha-nature, everyone with the Buddha-nature may attain Buddhahood.”"
"**问**：如来佛是不是释迦牟尼？还是另一人？","**Q:** Is the Chinese term “Rulai Fo” identical to Sākyamuni or is he somebody else?"
"**答**：“如来”这个名词是从梵语Tathāgata译出来的。“如”字就是“真如”（tathatā），即一切法（事物）的真实状况，它又包含“如实”（Yathābhūtam）的意义。佛经对“如来”的解释是：“乘真如之道而来”，又说“如实而来”。“如来”是一个通用名词，它是“佛陀”的异名。如释迦牟尼佛，可以称释迦牟尼如来；阿弥陀佛，可以称阿弥陀如来。","**A:** “Rulai” was translated from the Sanskrit word “Tathāgata”. “Ru” means “suchness” (tathatā), or “according to the reality” (Yathābhūtam), i.e. the ultimate reality of all dhammas, while “lai” means “come”. “Rulai” (Tathāgata) is interpreted in the Buddhist scriptures as “coming by the path of Tathāgata” or “coming according to the reality”. Tathāgata is a general term and another name for “the Buddha”. Thus Gotama Buddha can be called Gotama Tathāgata, and Amita Buddha can be called Amita Tathāgata."
"**问**：阿弥陀佛和释迦牟尼佛不是一个人吗？","**Q:** Are Amita Buddha and Gotama Buddha not one and the same?"
"**答**：不是。阿弥陀佛是另外一个世界上的佛。阿弥陀佛是梵语Amitābha的音译，意义是“无量的光明”。","**A:** No, Amita Buddha or Amitābha is the Buddha of another world. The Chinese term “Amituofo” is the transliteration from Sanskrit of “Amitābha”, meaning “boundless light”."
"**问**：“南无佛”是什么意思？为什么读起来是“那摩佛”？","**Q:** What is the meaning of “Nanmo Fo” (南无佛)? Why is it pronounced as “Namo Fo” (那摩佛)?"
"**答**：“南无”是梵语Namo的音译，念成“那摩”，是保持原来古代的读音。现代广东、福建一部分地区，仍保持这个古音。它的意义是“敬礼”。今天印度人相见，互道“那摩悉对”，就是说：“敬礼了”。","**A:** “Nanmo” is the transliteration of the Sanskrit “Namo”. The Chinese characters “南无” were used since their pronunciation was similar with “namo” in ancient times when this term was introduced into China. Such a pronunciation is still preserved now in parts of China’s Guangdong and Fujian provinces. “Namo” means salutation or homage. Even today, when Indians meet, they say “Namaste” to each other, that is “Homage to you”."
"**问**：释迦牟尼的一生可以简略介绍一下么？","**Q:** What is known about the life of Sākyamuni?"
"**答**：可以。释迦牟尼的时代，约当公元前六世纪中叶，正是我国春秋时代，与孔子同时。他是当时迦毗罗国（Kapilavatthu）国王的长子。父亲名净饭（Suddhodana），母亲名摩耶（Māyā）。摩耶夫人生产前，根据当时习俗，回到母家去，路过蓝毗尼花园（Lumbinī），在树下休息的时候，生下了悉达多王子。","**A:** Well, Sākyamuni lived around the 6th century BC, equivalent to the Spring and Autumn Period in China, and was a contemporary of Confucius. He was the eldest son of the King of Kapilavatthu. His father was named Suddhodana; his mother, Māyā. Queen Māyā gave birth to Prince Siddhattha on the way to her parents’ home while taking a rest under a tree in Lumbinī Grove, since, according to the custom prevailing in India at that time, women should go back to their parents’ home for child bearing."
"**问**：蓝毗尼花园现在还有遗址留存下来吗？","**Q:** Are there any vestiges of Lumbinī Grove remaining today?"
"**答**：公元七世纪时，我国玄奘法师曾到过蓝毗尼。根据他的记载，他曾经看到在他之前八百多年阿育王（Aśoka）在那里建立的石柱，标志着佛陀诞生之处，但当时石柱已被雷击破，柱头倒在地下，已经是衰落的情景了。后来由于没有人能够识得柱上的文字，因此佛陀诞生的地址久已湮没无闻。直到1897年才被人发现了阿育王的石柱，考古家认识出上面的文字，这才发掘出蓝毗尼园的遗址，在附近并且发掘出古代的市镇，其中有些可以相信是属于当时的迦毗罗城的。今天尼泊尔政府已经把这个地方作为圣地加以建设和保护。","**A:** During the 7th century AD, Tipitakācariya Xuan Zang (Hsuan Tsang) of China visited Lumbinī Grove. According to his account, he saw the stone pillar erected there by King Aśoka about 800 years before, marking the birthplace of the Buddha. The site at that time, however, was in a state of desolation, the pillar having been struck by lightning and the top having fallen down onto the ground. Subsequently, the birthplace of the Buddha sank into oblivion because nobody could read the letters on the pillar. It was not until 1897 when the Aśoka pillar was re-discovered, archeologists deciphered the inscriptions and the ravaged ruins of Lumbinī Grove were excavated. Some ancient settlements were also excavated in the vicinity of that site, part of which may have belonged to the old city of Kapilavatthu. Today, the government of Nepal has proclaimed it as Holy Land and undertaken necessary reconstruction and protection."
"**问**：释迦牟尼幼年教养情况是怎样？","**Q:** How was Sākyamuni educated in his childhood?"
"**答**：摩耶夫人产后不久就死了。幼年时代的释迦牟尼是由他的姨母波波提夫人（Prajāpati）养育的。他自小从婆罗门学者们学习文学、哲学、算学等等，知识很广博。又从武士们学习武术，是一个骑射击剑的能手。他父亲净饭王因为他天资聪慧，相貌奇伟，对他期望很大，希望他继承王位后，建功立业，成为一个“转轮王”（统一天下的君主）。","**A:** Queen Māyā died soon after giving birth. Young Sākyamuni was brought up by his aunt (his mother’s sister) Princess Prajāpati. As a child he began to learn literature, philosophy, arithmetic and so on from Brahmin scholars and gained a broad and profound knowledge. He also learned martial arts from warriors and became a master atriding, shooting and fencing. Because of his great intelligence and striking features, his father, king Suddhodana, hoped that he would become a universal ruler (Rāja Cakkavattin, a king who could unify the whole world) and perform meritorious services after he succeeded to the throne."
"**问**：那么，他后来为什么不继承王位呢？","**Q:** Why didn’t he succeed to the throne later on?"
"**答**：悉达多王子在幼年的时候，就有沉思的习惯，世间许多现象，给他看到，都容易引起他的感触和深思：饥渴困乏、在烈日下耕田的农人，绳索鞭打、口喘汗流拖着犁头耕地的牛，蛇虫鸟兽弱肉强食的情景，衰丑龙钟的老人，辗转呻吟的病人，亲朋哭泣送葬中的死人，这些都促使他思索着一个问题——如何解脱世界的苦痛。他读过的吠陀书（Veda，婆罗门经典）不能解决他的问题。他学到的知识和他未来的王位、权力也都不能解决他的问题。于是他很早就有了出家的念头，后来终于舍弃了王位。","**A:** Prince Siddhattha in his childhood developed the habit of meditating. Many phenomena he observed touched him strongly and made him think hard: e.g. the hungry, thirsty and exhausted peasants working under the scorching sun, panting and sweating cattle being flogged as they plough, the struggle among snakes, insects, birds and beasts under the law of the jungle, weak and ugly old people, the moaning and suffering sick, the dead in funeral processions with their families and friends weeping behind. All these presented him with a problem: how to deliver the world from suffering. Neither the Veda he had read nor the knowledge he had acquired, nor his future throne and power could solve this problem. Therefore, he harbored the idea of renouncing the world in his early days, and finally he relinquished his throne."
"**问**：他父亲怎么会让他出家呢？","**Q:** How could his father agree to his renunciation?"
"**答**：净饭王发觉了他儿子的心思后，曾经想过各种办法防止他，特别是企图从生活的享受上羁縻他。悉达多王子十六岁时，净饭王便为他娶了邻国的王女耶输陀罗（Yasodharā）为妃，生了一个儿子叫罗怙罗（Rāhula）。但是这一切都没有能够阻止他，终于在一天夜深人静的时候，他偷偷地出了国城，进入一个森林中，换去王子的衣服，剃去须发，成为一个修道者。关于他出家时的年龄，有两种不同记载，一说是十九岁，一说是二十九岁。","**A:** Having found out what his son had in mind, King Suddhodana tried many ways to detain him, especially by surrounding him with worldly pleasures. When Siddhattha was only 16 years old, King Suddhodana arranged for him to marry Princess Yasodharā from a neighboring state. Yasodharā bore him a son named Rāhula. But all this was in vain. He finally slipped out of the capital city in the still of a night. He entered a forest, took off his princely clothes and, having shaven his head and beard, became a wandering mendicant. Regarding his age at the time of renunciation, there are two different accounts—one says nineteen, and the other twenty-nine."
"**问**：出家以后的情形怎样？","**Q:** What about his life after he renounced the world?"
"**答**：他父亲曾尽力劝他回去无效，只好在亲族中选派五个人随从他一起，这五个人的名字是：陈如（ Kaund inya, P. Kond añña），跋堤（ Bhadrika, P. Bhaddiya），跋波（Vāspa, P. Vappa），摩诃男（ Mahānāma, P. Mahānāma），阿说示（AŚvajit, P. Assaji）。悉达多王子和他的侍者们先后寻访当时三个有名的学者，从他们学道，但都不能满足他的要求。于是他知道当时哲学思想中没有真正解脱之法，便离开了他们，走到尼连禅河（Nairañjanā，P：Nerañjarā，现在叫做Lilaian）岸边的树林中，和那里的苦行人（极端刻苦修行的人）在一起。为了寻求解脱，他尝够了艰苦辛酸，坚持不懈，经历六年之久。但是结果徒劳无功，方才悟到苦行是无益的。他于是走到尼连禅河里去沐浴，洗去了六年的积垢，随后受了一个牧女供养的牛奶，恢复了气力。当时随从他的五个人见到他的情景，以为他放弃了信心和努力，便离开了他，前往波罗奈城（Benares）去继续他们的苦行。王子于是一个人走到一棵毕钵罗（Pippala）树下，铺上了吉祥草，向着东方盘腿坐着，发誓说：“我今如不证到无上大觉，宁可让此身粉碎，终不起此座。”他便这样在树下思维解脱之道，终于在一个夜里，战胜了最后的烦恼魔障，获得了彻底觉悟而成了佛陀。","**A:** Having tried in vain to persuade him to return, his father chose five men from his clan to accompany him. They were Kaundinya, Bhadrika, Vāspa, Mahānāma, and AŚvajit (P. Kondañña, Bhaddiya, Vappa, Mahānāma, Assaji). Prince Siddhattha and his followers successively paid visits to three famous scholars and learned from them, but none of them could satisfy his quest. When he realized that no real path of deliverance (or absolution) was to be found in the philosophical thought of that time, he left for a forest on the banks of the Nerañjarā river, now the Lilaian, and lived there with other ascetics. In his search for emancipation, he went through suffering and pain for six years. However, since it proved fruitless, he began to understand that austerities were to no avail. So he went to take a bath in the Nerañjarā River, cleaning off all the dirt of six years. Then, after accepting the milk gruel offered by a herdswoman, his strength was restored afresh. When his five followers saw this, they thought he had abandoned his faith and spiritual efforts, so they left him for Benares City (P. Bārānasī) to continue their ascetic practices. The Prince then went alone to a Pippala tree and made a seat with auspicious grass (kuśa) under the tree. Sitting down with his legs crossed and facing the east he vowed, “Now should I fail to attain supreme enlightenment, I would rather have my body decompose than rise from this seat.” In such a manner, he commenced meditating on absolution, and finally one night defeated the moral affliction and Māra’s temptations (kilesa and Māra), achieved complete enlightenment, thereby becoming a Buddha."
"**问**：释迦牟尼成佛处，现有遗迹留存吗？","**Q:** Are there any vestiges remaining of the site where Sākyamuni became a Buddha?"
"**答**：释迦牟尼成佛处，自古称为菩提场或菩提伽耶（Buddhagayā），那里的毕钵罗树，因为佛坐在树下成道的缘故，得到了菩提树之名。从此，所有毕钵罗树都叫做菩提树。“菩提”就是“觉”的意思。菩提伽耶在今天印度比哈尔省伽耶城（Gayā）的南郊。那棵菩提树在二千数百年中曾两次遭到斫伐，一次遭风拔，但都重生了新芽，现在的菩提树是原来那棵树的曾孙。树下释迦牟尼坐处有石刻的金刚座。树的东面有一座宏伟庄严的塔寺，名叫大菩提寺，至今约有一千八百多年的历史，附近还有许多佛的遗迹和古代石刻与建筑。1956年印度比哈尔省政府为了这个圣地的建设和管理，设立了一个国际性的咨询委员会。中国佛教协会接受了邀请，指派了两名代表参加该会。","**A:** The site where Sākyamuni attained Buddhahood has been known as the Place of Enlightenment or Buddhagayā ever since. The Pippala tree there, as well as that kind of tree in general later became known as Bodhi tree. Bodhi means enlightenment. Buddhagayā is situated in the southern suburbs of Gayā City in Bihar Pradesh of India today. In the course of more than twenty centuries, the Bodhi tree was twice chopped down and once blown over, but always sprouted again. The present Bodhi tree is a great grandson of the original one. At the plot where the Buddha sat under the tree is a stone-carved diamond pedestal (Vajrāsana). To the east of the tree is a majestic thūpa (S. stūpa) temple known as Mahābodhi Ārāma with a history of over 18 centuries, and nearby are a number of traces of the Buddha and ancient carved stones and constructions. In 1956, the government of Bihar Pradesh appointed an international advisory committee to supervise the construction and administration of the Holy Land. At its invitation the Buddhist Association of China, sent two delegates to that committee."
"**问**：释迦牟尼成佛后的事迹，可以简略地谈一谈吗？","**Q:** Would you please give a brief account regarding his life after Sākyamuni attained Buddhahood?"
"**答**：释迦牟尼成佛的年龄，也有不同的记载，有的说三十岁，有的说三十五岁。此后五十年（或四十五年）中，直到他八十岁逝世前，他没有间断过他的说法工作。他到处游行，向大众宣示他自己证悟的真理。他最初到波罗奈城去找离开了他的五个侍者，为他们说法。佛教把佛陀第一次说法，叫做“初转法轮”。","**A:** There are different versions regarding the age at which Sākyamuni attained enlightenment, some quote it as thirty and some as thirty-five. For fifty (or forty-five) years after that, until the end of his life at the age of 80, he never stopped preaching his doctrine. He traveled widely, preaching to the public the truth he had perceived. At the outset, he went to Benares (P. Bārānasī) to look for his five departed followers and preached the truth to them. The first sermon of the Buddha is called “the initial turning of the wheel of Dhamma” (S. Dharmacakra pravartana, P. Dhammacakkappavattana) in Buddhism."
"**问**：“转法轮”是什么意思？","**Q:** What does “turning the wheel of Dhamma” (Dhammacakkappavattana) mean?"
"**答**：“轮”（cakka），是印度古代战争中用的一种武器，它的形状像个轮子。印度古代有一种传说，征服四方的大王叫做转轮王，他出生的时候，空中自然出现此轮，预示他的前途无敌。这里以轮来比喻佛所说的法。佛的法轮出现于世，一切不正确的见解、不善的法都破碎无余，所以把说法叫做转法轮。佛初转法轮处是鹿野苑（Sārnāth），在今天波罗奈城（Benares）。经过近代的发掘，鹿野苑发现了不少有价值的文物。有阿育王的石柱，有公元四世纪石刻的佛初转法轮像等等，并且发掘到古代塔寺的遗址。鹿野苑现有佛寺、博物馆和图书馆，都是近几十年来陆续兴建起来的。佛初转法轮处的鹿野苑，和佛诞生处的蓝毗尼园、佛成道处的菩提伽耶、佛逝世处的拘尸那伽（S. Kuśinagara, P. Kusināra），是佛教四大圣迹。值得指出的是：近代学者们对这些圣迹以及其他一些古迹的发掘和修复，主要都是根据我国古代高僧法显、玄奘等的记载。","**A:** Cakka (wheel) was a wheel-like weapon used in wars in ancient India. There was an old legend in India that the rāja (king) that conquered the world would be the Rajacakkavattin, i.e. “The wheel-turning king”. At the time of his birth, a wheel appeared in the sky, prophesying that he would be unconquerable in the future. In Buddhism the wheel is used as a metaphor of the Dhamma preached by the Buddha. Once the Buddha’s Dhammacakka emerged, all the wrong thinking and evil things would be smashed and vanish. Hence the preaching of Dhamma is called Dhammacakkappavattana (turning the wheel of Dhamma). The Buddha’s initial turning of the wheel of Dhamma took place at Sārnāth Mrgadāva (Deer Park) in present-day Benares. Through the recent excavations, quite a few valuable relics have been discovered at Sārnāth, including the King Aśoka stone pillar, stone-engraved images of the Buddha’s first turning of the wheel of Dhamma dating from the 4th century AD etc. Even the ruins of the ancient thūpa temple were unearthed. Buddhist temples, museums and a library now standing there were built over the last few decades. There are four places regarded as the holy places of Buddhism: (1) Sārnāth, where the Buddha initially turned the wheel of Dhamma, (2) Lumbinī Grove, where the Buddha was born, (3) Buddhagayā, where the Buddha attained enlightenment, and (4) Kusināra, where the Buddha passed away. It is worthy of note that modern scholars excavated and repaired the holy places and other historical sites mainly on the basis of the records of the ancient Chinese pilgrims like Fa Xian (Fa Hsien) and Xuan Zang (Hsuan Tsang)."
"**问**：佛初次说法的地方为什么要比其他说法的地方看得重要呢？","**Q:** Why is the site of the Buddha’s first sermon looked upon as more important than other sermon sites?"
"**答**：佛在鹿野苑初转法轮这件事是佛教的一件大事。从那时起，开始建立了佛教；从那时起，开始具足了三宝。","**A:** The Buddha’s initial turning of the wheel of Dhamma at Sārnāth was a great event in Buddhism. At that time, Buddhism was established; and after that, the Three Gems (Tiratana) came into existence."
"**问**：“三宝”是什么？","**Q:** What are the Three Gems (Tiratana)?"
"**答**：佛陀是佛宝。佛所说的法是法宝。佛的出家弟子的团体——僧伽（Sangha）是僧宝。称之为宝，是因为它能够令大众止恶行善、离苦得乐，是极可尊贵的意思。佛初转法轮，陈如等五人都归依佛，出家为弟子，于是形成了僧伽。所以说，从那时起开始具足了三宝。","**A:** The Three Gems are the Gem of the Buddha, the enlightened one, the Gem of Dhamma, the teachings given by the Buddha, and the Gem of Sangha, the Order of the Buddha’s monastic disciples. These three are called gems (ratana) because they can lead people to stop doing evil and to perform kindness, to free themselves from suffering and to gain happiness. The title of “The Three Gems” also shows the great value placed on them. When the Buddha initially turned the wheel of Dhamma, Kond añña and others, five of them in all, followed the Buddha, renounced lay life and became the Buddha’s disciples, thus forming the San^4^gha Order. Therefore, the Three Gems have been cherished since that time."
"**问**：什么叫做归依？","**Q:** What is the meaning of “abiding by the Three Gems” (“Ti-saranam gacchāmi”)?"
"**答**：归依的意思是：身心归向它、依靠它。归依三宝的人是佛教徒。“归依”也可以写成“皈依”，“皈”与“归”的读音和意义相同。","**A:** Ti-saran am gacchāmi means that one abides by the Three Gems with one’s heart and soul. Those who have gone to and relied on the Three Gems are Buddhists."
"**问**：佛在世的时候，归依的人多吗？","**Q:** Were there many people who came and followed the Buddha during his lifetime?"
"**答**：是的，佛初转法轮后从鹿野苑到摩揭陀国（Magadha）去的一路上，受到他的教化而归依的人就很多。其中有拜火教的婆罗门姓迦叶的三兄弟，都改变了原来的信仰，率领他们的弟子一千多人归依了佛教。佛到了摩揭陀国首都王舍城（Rājagaha）后，归依的人更多。其中最有名的出家弟子有舍利弗（Sāriputta）、摩诃目犍连（Mahāmoggallāna）、摩诃迦叶（Mahākassapa）等人。后来佛回到故乡去，他的异母弟难陀（Nanda）、堂兄弟阿难陀（Ānanda）、提婆达多（Devadatta）和他儿子罗怙罗等都随他出了家。还有宫廷中一个剃发工奴优波离（Upāli）也出家加入了僧团，后来成为有名的佛教戒律学大师。佛的姨母波波提也归依了佛，是第一个出家女弟子。至于不出家而归依三宝的弟子则为数更多。佛的出家弟子，男的叫比丘（bhikkhu），女的叫做比丘尼（bhikkhunī）；在家弟子，男的叫做邬波索迦（upāsaka），女的叫做邬波斯迦（ upāsikā），合称为四众弟子。","**A:** Yes. On the way from Sārnāth to Magadha State after the Buddha’s first sermon, many people were converted to follow his teachings. Among them were three brothers, Brahmins, by the name of Kassapa. They had been Zoroastrians, but were now converted and brought along with them more than one thousand of their followers to be converted to Buddhism. After the Buddha arrived in Rājagaha, the capital of Magadha, many more people were converted, including some who were to become prominent disciples, like Sāriputta, Mahāmoggallāna and Mahākassapa. Afterwards, when the Buddha returned to his native land, a number of his relatives: his younger half brother Nanda, his cousins Ānanda and Devadatta, his son Rāhula became monastic disciples. Among them, there was a barber named Upãli, who had served the royal family, and later became a famous master of Buddhist disciplines (Vinaya bhānaka). The Buddha’s aunt Prajāpati also followed to become the first female monastic disciple of the Buddha. Besides, even more devotees were converted to the faith without renouncing the home life. Therefore, the Buddha’s disciples consist of Bhikkhu (monks) and Bhikkhunī (nuns), who form the Buddhist monastic order; and Upāsaka and Upāsikā, who are the male and female lay followers; together they are known as the four groups of disciples."
