"第一章","Chapter 1"
"我父亲姓皮利普，我的教名是菲利普。然而在我年幼时，对于这两个名字的音，我却只能发出“皮普”，再长或是再清晰一点，我都无法做到。因此，我就叫我自己皮普，最后人们也就都叫我皮普了。","My father’s family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name Philip, my infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit than Pip.So, I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip."
"我说我父亲姓皮利普是有根据的，一来父亲的墓碑上是这么刻的，二来我的姐姐——乔·格雷戈里太太也是这么说的。我姐姐她嫁给了铁匠乔·格雷戈里。因为我没有见过我的父母亲，也没有看到过他们任何一位的相片（因为他们那个时代距照相发明的时代还远着呢），所以我最初对他们长相的想象还是毫无根据地基于他们墓碑上字体的形状而来的。我父亲墓碑上字母的形状让我对他产生一个奇怪的想法——他是个方方正正、强壮结实、皮肤黝黑的男人，还有一头黑色的卷发。而根据碑文那几个字——“及上述者之妻乔治亚娜”的笔体和写法,我得出了一个很幼稚的结论：我的母亲脸上有雀斑，而且体弱多病。在我父母亲的坟墓旁，整整齐齐地排列着五座小小的菱形墓碑。每一座都大概有一英尺半那么高，这是用来纪念我五位小兄长的墓碑。他们五位早早地便放弃了世人为了生存而进行的奋斗——怀着一种宗教般的信念，我坚信他们出生时都是面朝天，两手插在裤袋里，而且永远没有拿出来过，就像现在一样。","I give Pirrip as my father’s family name, on the authority of his tombstone and my sister—Mrs. Joe Gregory, who married the blacksmith.As I never saw my father or my mother, and never saw any likeness of either of them (for their days were long before the days of photographs), my first fancies regarding what they were like, were unreasonably derived from their tombstones.The shape of the letters on my father’s, gave me an odd idea that he was a square, stout, dark man, with curly black hair.From the character and turn of the inscription, ‘ALSO GEORGIANA WIFE OF THE ABOVE,’ I drew a childish conclusion that my mother was freckled and sickly.To five little stone lozenges, each about a foot and a half long, which were arranged in a neat row beside their grave, and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of mine—who gave up trying to get a living, exceedingly early in that universal struggle—I am indebted for a belief I religiously entertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands in their trousers-pockets, and had never taken them out in this state of existence."
"我们家住在河边，位于一片乡村沼泽地区。小河蜿蜒而下，在距此不到二十英里处注入大海。似乎是在一个难忘的、阴冷的傍晚，我才第一次对周遭事物的特征有了生动而全面的印象。那时我才确切地发现，这个荨麻丛生的惨淡之地正是教堂墓地；已故的本教区居民菲利普·皮利普及其亡妻乔治亚娜都埋葬在此处；而他们年幼的孩子们，亚历山大、巴塞洛缪、亚伯拉罕、托拜厄斯和罗杰，也都已经故去并埋葬于此。我才明白，在墓地之外的那片幽暗而平坦的荒芜之地是沼泽。那里交错分布着沟渠、土堤和闸门，还有零星的牛群在四处觅食；远处那条低洼的、深灰色的线正是那条河流；更远处那荒芜的洞穴就是大海，风从那里不断地吹来；而那个因为惧怕这一切而浑身发抖，并哇哇大哭起来的小孩子正是我，皮普。","Ours was the marsh country, down by the river, within, as the river wound, twenty miles of the sea.My first most vivid and broad impression of the identity of things seems to me to have been gained on a memorable raw afternoon towards evening.At such a time I found out for certain, that this bleak place overgrown with nettles was the churchyard; and that Philip Pirrip, late of this parish, and also Georgiana wife of the above, were dead and buried; and that Alexander, Bartholomew, Abraham, Tobias, and Roger, infant children of the aforesaid, were also dead and buried;and that the dark flat wilderness beyond the churchyard, intersected with dykes and mounds and gates, with scattered cattle feeding on it, was the marshes; and that the low leaden line beyond, was the river; and that the distant savage lair from which the wind was rushing, was the sea; and that the small bundle of shivers growing afraid of it all and beginning to cry, was Pip."
"“别吵了！”一个恐怖的声音吼道，这时一个男人从教堂门廊旁边的坟墓堆中蹿了出来。“消停点，你这个小鬼！不然我就割破你的喉咙！”","“Hold your noise!” cried a terrible voice, as a man started up from among the graves at the side of the church porch.“Keep still, you little devil, or I’ll cut your throat!”"
"这是个让人不寒而栗的男人。他全身上下穿着粗糙的灰布衣服，腿上绑着一条大铁镣。他没有戴帽子，只是在头上裹了一圈破布，脚上穿着一双破旧的鞋。他曾在水中浸泡过，在泥潭中挣扎过。他的腿被石头弄伤，成了跛子，身上也被火石割破，被荨麻刺到，被荆棘划伤。他一瘸一拐地走着，全身发抖，瞪大眼睛怒吼着。当他一把抓住我的下巴时，他的牙齿还在打战。","A fearful man, all in coarse grey, with a great iron on his leg.A man with no hat, and with broken shoes, and with an old rag tied round his head.A man who had been soaked in water, and smothered in mud, and lamed by stones, and cut by flints, and stung by nettles, and torn by briars; who limped, and shivered, and glared and growled; and whose teeth chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin."
"“噢！请不要割破我的喉咙，先生。”我哀求着，声音里充满了恐惧。“先生，求求您不要这么做。”","“O!Don’t cut my throat, sir,” I pleaded in terror.“Pray don’t do it, sir.”"
"“告诉我们你的名字。”那个男人说，","“Tell us your name!”said the man."
"“快说！”","“Quick!”"
"“皮普，先生。”","“Pip, sir.”"
"“再说一遍。”那人两眼盯着我说道，“张开嘴，说清楚一点！”","“Once more,” said the man, staring at me.“Give it mouth!”"
"“皮普。是皮普，先生。”","“Pip.Pip, sir.”"
"“告诉我们你住在哪里。”那个人说，“把那个地方指给我看！”","“Show us where you live,” said the man.“Pint out the place!”"
"我把我们村子的位置指给他看。就是那片海岸旁的平地，周围是一片赤杨树和修剪过的树丛，离教堂大概有一英里多远。","I pointed to where our village lay, on the flat in-shore among the alder-trees and pollards, a mile or more from the church."
"那个人打量了我一会儿，然后把我头朝下倒拎了起来，把我口袋里的东西都倒空了。然而，我口袋里除了一片面包外，就什么都没有了。当教堂在我眼前恢复原态时——因为他刚才的动作太猛、太突然，把我头朝下调了个个，我看到塔尖到了我的脚底下——总之，就像我说的那样，当教堂在我的眼前恢复原态时，我正坐在一块高高的墓碑上，全身哆嗦着，而他却在大口大口地嚼着面包。","The man, after looking at me for a moment, turned me upside down, and emptied my pockets.There was nothing in them but a piece of bread.When the church came to itself—for he was so sudden and strong that he made it go head over heels before me, and I saw the steeple under my feet—when the church came to itself, I say, I was seated on a high tombstone, trembling, while he ate the bread ravenously."
"“你这只小狗。”他边舔着嘴唇边说，“你看看你的脸蛋多胖啊。”","“You young dog,” said the man, licking his lips, “what fat cheeks you have got.”"
"我也觉得我的脸蛋是挺胖的，虽然对于我这个年龄来说，我的个头有点矮小，身体也算不上强壮。","I believe they were fat, though I was at that time undersized for my years, and not strong."
"“我要吃不了它们才怪呢，妈的。”他又说，脑袋还威胁似的一晃,“我真想吃了它们！”","“Darn me if I couldn’t eat ’em,” said the man, with a threatening shake of his head, “and if I haven’t half a mind to’t!”"
"我急忙诚恳地希望他千万不要那么做，同时将他把我按上去的那块墓碑抓得更紧了，一方面是想坐得更稳一些，另一方面是为了让自己不哭出来。","I earnestly expressed my hope that he wouldn’t, and held tighter to the tombstone on which he had put me; partly, to keep myself upon it; partly, to keep myself from crying."
"“现在听我说！”他说，“你母亲在哪里？”","“Now looked here!” said the man.“Where’s your mother?”"
"“在那里，先生！”我回答。","“There, sir!” said I."
"他吃了一惊，然后拔腿就跑，跑了几步又停了下来，回头看了看。","He started, made a short run, and stopped and looked over his shoulder."
"“在那里，先生！”我小心地解释道，“也就是乔治亚娜。那就是我母亲。”","“There, sir!” I timidly explained.“Also Georgiana.That’s my mother.”"
"“噢！”他说着又走了回来，“那么，和你母亲葬在一起的是你的父亲？”","“Oh!” said he, coming back.“And is that your father a longer your mother?”"
"“是的，先生。”我回答，“他也葬在这里，是位已故的本教区居民。”","“Yes, sir,” said I; “him too; late of this parish.”"
"“哈！”他若有所思地嘟囔着说道，“你和谁一起生活——如果我很仁慈地让你活下去的话。当然，这件事目前我还没有做决定。”","“Ha!” he muttered then, considering.“Who dye live with—supposing you is kindly let to live, which I hadn’t made up my mind about?”"
"“我的姐姐，先生——乔·格雷戈里太太——也就是铁匠乔·格雷戈里的妻子，先生。”","“My sister, sir—Mrs. Joe Gregory—wife of Joe Gregory, the blacksmith, sir.”"
"“铁匠，哦。”他说着。他同时低下头去看他的腿。","“Blacksmith, eh?” said he.And looked down at his leg."
"他阴郁地看看他的腿，又看看我。这样看了几次之后，他向我所在的墓碑凑近，抓住我的双臂，尽量把我的身体向后按。这样他就可以用他那咄咄逼人的目光盯着我的眼睛，而我却只能很无助地抬头看着他。","After darkly looking at his leg and me several times, he came closer to my tombstone, took me by both arms, and tilted me back as far as he could hold me; so that his eyes looked most powerfully down into mine, and mine looked most helplessly up into his."
"“现在，听我说。”他说，“问题就是我究竟让不让你活下去。你知道什么是锉刀吗？”","“Now looked here,” he said, ‘the question being whether you’re to be let to live.You know what a file is?’"
"“我知道，先生。”","“Yes, sir.”"
"“你知道什么是食物吗？”","“And you know what wittles is?”"
"“我知道，先生。”","“Yes, sir.”"
"每问一个问题，他就把我再往后按一点，好让我感到更加的无助和危险。","After each question he titled me over a little more, so as to give me a greater sense of helplessness and danger."
"“你给我弄一把锉刀来。”他又把我往后按了一下。","“You get me a file.”He tilted me again."
"“再给我弄点食物来。”他又把我往后按。“这两样东西你都要给我弄来。”他又把我往后按。“否则我就把你的心肝都挖出来。”他再一次把我往后按。","“And you get me witless.”He tilted me again.“You bring ’em both to me.”He tilted me again.“Or I’ll have your heart and liver out.”He tilted me again."
"我害怕极了，感到头晕目眩。于是我两手紧紧地抓住他，说：“请您发发慈悲，让我的身体直起来吧，先生，这样我可能就不会吐出来了，或许我就能更专心地听您说话了。”","I was dreadfully frightened, and so giddy that I clung to him with both hands, and said, “If you would kindly please to let me keep upright, sir, perhaps I shouldn’t be sick, and perhaps I could attend more.”"
"他把我使劲一推，让我滚到了地上。这样一来教堂也跳了起来，跳得比屋顶的定风针还要高。之后，他抓着我的双臂，让我直直地坐在墓碑上面，继续他那些令人恐惧的话语：“明天一早，你要给我带来锉刀和吃的。你把这些东西给我带到那边的老炮台去。你帮我办好这些事，但是不能透漏半点风声，不能留下任何痕迹，不能让人知道你曾经见到过我这个人，或见到到任何人。这样的话，我就会让你活命。如果你事情没有办成，或是有哪点和我说的不一样的话，不管是多小的差别，我都会把你的心肝挖出来，烤烤吃了。要知道，我并不是像你想的那样孤身一人。和我一起躲着的还有一个年轻人。跟他比起来，我可就是个天使了。他正在听着我说话呢。他抓小男孩，挖出他们的心肝可有一套独特的秘密法子。任何小男孩都不可能躲开这个年轻人。一个小男孩可以锁上家门，睡在暖和的床上，用被子把自己裹得严严实实的，再用衣服盖在头上。这样他或许觉得自己既舒服又安全，但是那个年轻人会轻轻地爬啊，爬啊，一直爬到小男孩的身边，然后把他撕裂。现在，我费了很大劲，不让那个年轻人来伤害你。不过我发现，很难让他一直远离你。现在，你决定怎么办？”","He gave me a most tremendous dip and roll, so that the church jumped over its own weather-cock.Then, he held me by the arms, in an upright position on the top of the stone, and went on in these fearful terms: “You bring me, tomorrow morning early, that file and them witless.You bring the lot to me, at that old Battery over yonder.You do it, and you never dare to say a word or dare to make a sign concerning your having seen such a person as me, or any person sum ever, and you shall be let to live.You fail, or you go from my words in any par tickler, no matter how small it is, and your heart and your liver shall be tore out, roasted and ate.Now, I am not alone, as you may think I am.There’s a young man hid with me, in comparison with which young man I am a Angel.That young man hears the words I speak.That young man has a secret way peculiar to himself, of getting at a boy, and at his heart, and at his liver.It is in wan for a boy to attempt to hide himself from that young man.A boy may lock his door, may be warm in bed, may tuck himself up, may draw the clothes over his head, may think he comfortable and safe, but that young man will softly creep and creep his way to him and tear him open.I am a keeping that young man from harming of you at the present moment, with great difficulty.I find it wary hard to hold that young man off of your inside.Now, what do you say?”"
"我说我会给他弄到锉刀，并且尽量给他找些吃的，哪怕是残羹剩食。第二天一早我会把东西给他送到炮台那里。","I said that I would get him the file, and I would get him what broken bits of food I could, and I would come to him at the Battery, early in the morning."
"“那么你就发誓，要是你不来，就天打雷劈。”那人说。","“Say Lord strikes you dead if you don’t!” said the man."
"我照他说的发了誓，然后他就把我从墓碑上放了下来。","I said so, and he took me down."
"“听着，”他继续说，“你要记得你答应我的事，记得那个年轻人！回家去吧！”","“Now,” he pursued, “you remember what you’ve undertook, and you remember that young man, and you get home!”"
"“晚——晚安，先生。”我支支吾吾地说。","“Goo-good night, sir,” I faltered."
"“不要再说了！”他说道，同时用目光扫视着他周边阴冷、潮湿的沼泽平地。“真希望我是只青蛙，或是一条泥鳅！”","“Much of that!” said he, glancing about him over the cold wet flat.“I wish I was a frog.Or a eel!”"
"说着，他用双臂环抱住自己抖动的身体——紧紧地抱着，仿佛要防止自己散架似的——一瘸一拐地向低矮的教堂围墙走去。我看着他离开，看着他在青青的坟堆中小心翼翼地穿过那一片片荨麻和荆棘。在我年幼的眼中，他仿佛是在躲避那些悄悄从坟墓里伸出来的手，防止它们扭住他的脚踝，把他拖进坟墓里去。","At the same time, he hugged his shuddering body in both his arms—clasping himself, as if to hold himself together—and limped towards the low church wall.As I saw him go, picking his way among the nettles, and among the brambles that bound the green mounds, he looked in my young eyes as if he were eluding the hands of the dead people, stretching up cautiously out of their graves, to get a twist upon his ankle and pull him in."
"他走到教堂低矮的围墙下，翻了过去。他的两条腿仿佛麻木了一般，僵硬无比。之后他回过头来看了看我。看到他转过了头，我立刻面向回家的方向，以最快的速度朝着家里奔去。但是，过了一会儿，我回过头，看到他又朝着河那边走去，仍旧用两臂紧抱着自己的身体，拖着疼痛的双脚，踏着放在沼泽地里的大石头上前行。那些大石头星罗棋布，是用来在下大雨或涨潮的时候当垫脚石的。","When he came to the low church wall, he got over it, like a man whose legs were numbed and stiff, and then turned round to look for me.When I saw him turning, I set my face towards home, and made the best use of my legs.But presently I looked over my shoulder, and saw him going on again towards the river, still hugging him in both arms, and picking his way with his sore feet among the great stones dropped into the marshes here and there, for stepping-places when the rains were heavy, or the tide was in."
"当我又一次停下来找寻他的身影时，沼泽地仿佛已经变成了一条又黑又长的水平线。而那条河成为了另一条水平线，虽然没有那么宽，也没有那么黑。天空则成了一排由暗红色线条和浓黑色线条交织在一起的长带子。在整个背景中，我只能依稀地分辨出在河流边上两个竖直站立的黑色的东西。一个是水手们用来掌舵的灯塔——仿佛一只脱了钩的桶被挂在杆子上——离得越近越觉得难看。另一个是绞刑架，上面悬着一些铁链，那里曾经绞死过一个海盗。那个人现在正朝着绞刑架一跛一跛地走去，仿佛他就是那个海盗，死而复生，从绞架上下来，又要重新把自己吊上去。这个想法让我觉得非常恐怖。当我看到他身后的牲畜也抬起头凝视着他时，我怀疑它们是不是也是这样想的。我又环视周围，想找到那个恐怖的年轻人，但一点迹象都没有发现。于是，我又吓得要死，一刻不停地跑回了家。","The marshes were just a long black horizontal line then, as I stopped to look after him; and the river were just another horizontal line, not nearly so broad not yet so black; and the sky was just a row of long angry red lines and dense black lines intermixed.On the edge of the river I could faintly make out the only two black things in all the prospect that seemed to be standing upright; one of these was the beacon by which the sailors steered—like an unhooked cask upon a pole—an ugly thing when you were near it; the other a gibbet, with some chains hanging to it which had once held a pirate.The man was limping on towards this latter, as if he were the pirate come to life, and come down, and going back to hook himself up again.It gave me a terrible turn when I thought so; and as I saw the cattle lifting their heads to gaze after him, I wondered whether they thought so too.I looked all round for the horrible young man, and could see no signs of him.But, now I was frightened again, and ran home without stopping."
"第二章","Chapter 2"
"我的姐姐乔·格雷戈里太太比我年长二十几岁。在邻居中，她以将我“一手”抚养大而享有盛誉。那时我就知道“一手”这个词是什么意思了。我知道她的手结实又笨重，她总是习惯把手打在她丈夫和我身上，我想我和乔·格雷戈里就是这样由她“一手”抚养大的吧。","My sister, Mrs. Joe Gregory, was more than twenty years older than I, and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbors because she had brought me up ‘by hand’.Having at that time to find out for myself what the expression meant, and knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand, and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as upon me, I supposed that Joe Gregory and I were both brought up by hand."
"我姐姐长得不怎么好看。我总有个印象，那就是一定是她“一手”策划好，让乔·格雷戈里娶她的。乔皮肤很白，光滑的脸颊两边留着淡黄色的卷发。他的双眼透着淡淡的蓝色，淡得几乎和眼白都混在一起，无法分辨。他性情温和、心地善良、脾气很好、十分随和。他虽然有些傻，却很讨人喜欢——他力大无比，却十分怕老婆，和赫尔克里士像极了。","She was not a good-looking woman, my sister; and I had a general impression that she must have made Joe Gregory marry her by hand.Joe was a fair man, with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his smooth face, and with eyes of such a much undecided blue that they seemed to have somehow got mixed with their own whites.He was a mild, good-natured, sweet-tempered, easy-going, foolish, dear fellow—a sort of Hercules in strength, and also in weakness."
"我的姐姐乔太太长着一头黑发，一双黑眼睛，可全身的皮肤却是红色的。我过去常常想，她可能不是用肥皂，而是用肉豆蔻擦子擦洗身体的。她身材高挑、瘦骨嶙峋的，总是系着一条粗布围裙，在她的背后打了两个节。她的胸前围了一条方方正正的围兜，上面别满了大头针和缝衣针。她每天都围着围裙，一方面把这当作自己的一大优良品质，另一方面还借此对乔大加责难。不过，我真的不明白她为什么要围着那个围裙。即使要围，我也不明白她为什么成天都围着，从不脱下来。","My sister, Mrs. Joe, with black hair and eyes, had such a prevailing redness of skin that I sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible she washed herself with a nutmeg-grater instead of soap.She was tall and bony, and almost always wore a coarse apron, fastened over her figure behind with two loops, and having a square impregnable bib in front, that was stuck full of pins and needles.She made it a powerful merit in herself, and a strong reproach against Joe, that she wore this apron so much.Though I really see no reason why she should have worn it at all: or why, if she did wear it at all, she should not have taken it off, every day of her life."
"乔的铁匠铺紧挨着我们住的房子。和那时我们村里大多数人家住的房子一样，我们家的房子也是木制结构的。当我从教堂墓地跑回家时，铁匠铺已经关门了，乔正一个人坐在厨房里。乔和我是难兄难弟，同病相怜。我们彼此坦诚相待，所以当我刚一抬起门闩，把头探进门里，看到乔坐在对面的火炉旁边时，他就告诉了我一个秘密。","Joe’s forge adjoined our house, which was a wooden house, as many of the dwellings in our country were—most of them, at that time.When I ran home from the churchyard, the forge was shut up, and Joe was sitting alone in the kitchen.Joe and I being fellow-sufferers, and having confidences as such, Joe imparted a confidence to me, the moment I raised the latch of the door and peeped in at him opposite to it, sitting in the chimney corner."
"“乔太太出去找过你十二次了，皮普。现在她又出去了，总共是十三次了。”","“Mrs. Joe has been out a dozen times, looking for you, Pip.And she’s out now, making it a baker’s dozen.”"
"“她是去找我了吗？”","“Is she?”"
"“是啊，皮普。”乔说，“更糟的是，她还带着那根胳肢棒呢。”","“Yes, Pip,” said Joe; “and what’s worse, she’s got Tickler with her.”"
"听到这个令人沮丧的情报，我不停地扭动着我背心上唯一的纽扣，极度抑郁地看着炉火。胳肢棒是一根一头涂着蜡的棒子。这根棒子经常在我身上搔痒，早就被磨得很光滑了。","At this dismal intelligence, I twisted the only button on my waistcoat round and round, and looked in great depression at the fire.Tickler was a wax-ended piece of cane, worn smooth by collision with my tickled frame."
"“她一会儿坐下，”乔说,“一会儿又站起来，之后她就抓起胳肢棒，发疯了似的冲了出去。就是这样。”乔一边说，一边用火钳慢慢地拨着火炉底层的木棒。他看着炉火说：“她就像发疯了一样地冲出去了，皮普。”","“She sat down,” said Joe, “and she got up, and she made a grab at Tickler, and she Rampaged out.That’s what she did,” said Joe, slowly clearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker, and looking at it: “she Rampaged out, Pip.”"
"“她出去很久了吗，乔？”我一贯把他看成是个身材高大一些的孩子，和我也没什么两样。","“Has she been gone long, Joe?”I always treated him as a larger species of child, and as no more than my equal."
"“是啊。”乔瞥了一眼那座荷兰大钟，说道，“她发疯了一样地冲出去了，这最后一次已经有五分钟了，皮普。她回来了！老弟，躲到门后去，用那条长毛巾盖住你自己。”","“Well,” said Joe, glancing up at the Dutch clock, “she’s been on the Rampage, this last spell, about five minutes, Pip.She’s a coming!Get behind the door, old chap, and have the jack-towel betwixt you.”"
"我按他说的做了。我的姐姐乔太太狠狠地把门推开，发现门背后有什么东西阻挡她开门，立刻就猜到了是什么，于是把胳肢棒伸了出去，想试探一下。结果便是她把我投向了乔——我总是这样被当作他们夫妻间的飞箭——而乔不论怎样都会很高兴地接住我，把我放在了火炉旁，默默地用他那健壮的腿保护着我。","I took the advice.My sister, Mrs. Joe, throwing the door wide open, and finding an obstruction behind it, immediately divined the cause, and applied Tickler to its further investigation.She concluded by throwing me—I often served as a connubial missile—at Joe, who, glad to get hold of me on any terms, passed me on into the chimney and quietly fenced me up there with his great leg."
"“你这只小野猴子，刚刚去哪里了？”乔太太边跺脚边说，“老实说你干什么去了，害得我又急又怕又担心。你要是不老实说，就算有五十个皮普，有五百个格雷戈里，我也要把你从那个角落里给拽出来。”","“Where have you been, you young monkey?” said Mrs. Joe, stamping her foot.“Tell me directly what you’ve been doing to wear me away with fret and fright and worry, or I’d have you out of that corner if you was fifty Pips, and he was five hundred Gorgers.”"
"“我只是去了教堂墓地。”我坐在凳子上说，边哭边揉着身上疼痛的地方。","“I have only been to the churchyard,” said I, from my stool, crying and rubbing myself."
"“教堂墓地！”我姐姐重复道，“要不是我，你早就去了那里啦，而且永远呆在那里回不来了啦。是谁一手把你拉扯大的？”","“Churchyard!” repeated my sister.“If it wasn’t for me you’d have been to the churchyard long ago, and stayed there.Who brought you up by hand?”"
"“是你。”我说。","“You did,” said I."
"“我想问问你，我为什么要这么做？”我姐姐喊道。","“And why did I do it, I should like to know?” exclaimed my sister."
"我呜咽着说：“我不知道。”","I whimpered, “I don’t know.”"
"“不知道！”我姐姐说，“我再也不会这么做了！我可知道。我还真要告诉你，打你一出生，我的围裙就没脱下来过。当一个铁匠的老婆（还是他，格雷戈里铁匠）已经够倒霉的了，还得当你的妈。”","“I don’t! ” said my sister.“I’d never do it again!I know that.I may truly say I’ve never had this apron of mine off, since born you were.It’s bad enough to be a blacksmith’s wife (and him a Gregory) without being your mother.”"
"我悲伤地望着炉火，思绪却早已离开了她提的那个问题。因为，沼泽地里遇到的那个腿上绑着铁链的逃犯、那个神秘的年轻人、锉刀、食物、还有我许下的那个可怕的誓言——为此我得去我寄宿的人家偷窃，所有这些都从那充满复仇之意的炉火中跳到我的面前。","My thoughts strayed from that question as I looked disconsolately at the fire.For, the fugitive out on the marshes with the ironed leg, the mysterious young man, the file, the food, and the dreadful pledge I was under to commit a larceny on those sheltering premises, rose before me in the avenging coals."
"“哈！”乔夫人说着把胳肢棒放回了原处，“教堂墓地！好啊！你们两个就好好地说教堂墓地吧。”其实，我们中有一个人根本就没有说过。“活在你们中间，你们就快要把我赶到教堂墓地了。等到那一天，噢，没有我，看你们这对，胆，胆小鬼怎么活！”","“Hah!” said Mrs. Joe, restoring Tickler to his station.“Churchyard, indeed!You may well say churchyard, you two.”One of us, by-the-bye, had not said it at all.“You’ll drive me to the churchyard betwixt you, one of these days, and oh, a pr-r-recoils pair you’d be without me!”"
"当她离开去布置茶点了之后，乔从他大腿上面偷偷地向下瞥我，好像他心里在设想着我和他自己，推测着如果她预言的悲惨情况真会发生的话，我们会变成怎样的一对。之后，他坐在那里，拨弄着自己右侧的淡黄色卷发和络腮胡，蓝色的眼睛跟随着乔太太的身影转动。每次起了风波，他总是这副模样。","As she applied herself to set the tea-things, Joe peeped down at me over his leg, as if he were mentally casting me and himself up, and calculating what kind of pair we practically should make, under the grievous circumstances foreshadowed.After that, he sat feeling his right-side flaxen curls and whisker, and following Mrs. Joe about with his blue eyes, as his manner always was at squally times."
"我姐姐给我们切黄油面包时的动作总是很麻利，而且总是一个样子。 首先，她用左手把一块面包牢牢地压在她的围兜上——有时那上面的大头针或缝衣针会扎进面包里，之后我们就会连针一起吃进嘴里。然后她在刀上涂一些黄油（不是很多），再涂到面包上。就像药剂师制做膏药一样——使用起刀子来极其敏捷，两面都不在话下。之后她根据面包壳的形状，修去多余的黄油。然后，她用刀子在“膏药”的边缘处进行最后的细致修整。最后，从整块面包上锯下很厚的一片，在这片和整块面包分离之前，将其一劈两半，乔一半，我一半。","My sister had a trenchant way of cutting our bread-and-butter for us that never varied.First, with her left hand she jammed the loaf hard and fast against her bib—where it sometimes got a pin into it, and sometimes a needle, which we afterwards got into our mouths.Then she took some butter (not too much) on a knife and spread it on the loaf, in an apothecary kind of way, as if she were making a plaster—using both sides of the knife with a slapping dexterity, and trimming and molding the butter off round the crust.Then, she gave the knife a final smart wipe on the edge of the plaster, and then sawed a very thick round off the loaf: which she finally, before separating from the loaf, hewed into two halves, of which Joe got one, and I the other."
"在目前的情况下，虽然我很饿，却不敢吃我的那一片。我觉得我必须留一些给我那个恐怖的朋友吃，还有他的同伴——那个更恐怖的年轻人。我知道乔太太的持家风格是最严谨的。我若是想从食柜里偷到些什么，是不可能的。于是我决定把我那一大片黄油面包片放在我的裤腿里。","On the present occasion, though I was hungry, I dared not eat my slice.I felt that I must have something in reserve for my dreadful acquaintance, and his ally the still more dreadful young man.I knew Mrs. Joe’s housekeeping to be of the strictest kind, and that my larcenous researches might find nothing available in the safe.Therefore I resolved to put my hunk of bread-and-butter down the leg of my trousers."
"我发现很难下足够的决心来完成这一想法。这就仿佛是我要下定决心从一个很高的屋顶上往下跳，或是跳进很深的水中一样。而更难的是乔对此事毫无察觉。前面我提到过我们是一对同病相怜的难兄难弟，他也总是很友好地和我相处。晚上我们有个习惯，那就是比较一下我们吃面包的速度。我们会时不时地悄悄举起各自的面包，并相互赞许——这样就会鼓励我们继续地啃下去。今晚，乔曾几次向我展示他那快速吃剩下的小块面包，对我发出邀请，进行我们例行的友好比赛。但他却每次都发现我一只膝盖上放着那个黄色的茶杯，另一只膝盖上放着我没动过的黄油面包。最后，我痛下决心，认为我考虑的事情必须得完成，而且要完成得神不知鬼不觉才好。我抓住了乔刚刚把视线从我身上移开的那一刻，把黄油面包扔进了裤腿。","The effort of resolution necessary to the achievement of this purpose, I found to be quite awful.It was as if I had to make up my mind to leap from the top of a high house, or plunge into a great depth of water.And it was made the more difficult by the unconscious Joe.In our already-mentioned freemasonry as fellow-sufferers, and in his good-natured companionship with me, it was our evening habit to compare the way we bit through out slices, by silently holding them up to each other’s admiration now and then—which stimulated us to new exertions.Tonight, Joe several times invited me, by the display of his fast-diminishing slice, to enter upon our usual friendly competition; but he found me, each time, with my yellow mug of tea on one knee, and my untouched bread-and-butter on the other.At last, I desperately considered that the thing I contemplated must be done, and that it had best be done in the least improbable manner consistent with the circumstances.I took advantage of a moment when Joe had just looked at me, and got my bread-and-butter down my leg."
"乔显得不太自在，因为他以为我食欲不振。他若有所思地咬了一小口面包，却并不怎么起劲。他咬下的这口面包在嘴里咀嚼的时间比平常都要久。他一边嚼一边想心事，最后像吞药丸一样一口吞了下去。当他正要咬第二口，而且把头歪向一边，找准了下口的位置时，他的目光落在了我的身上，发现我的黄油面包不翼而飞了。","Joe was evidently made uncomfortable by what he supposed to be my loss of appetite, and took a thoughtful bite out of his slice, which he didn’t seem to enjoy.He turned it about in his mouth much longer than usual, pondering over it a good deal, and after all gulped it down like a pill.He was about to take another bite, and had just got his head on one side for a good purchase on it, when his eye fell on me, and he saw that my bread-and-butter was gone."
"乔刚一咬就停住了，瞪着我，满脸的惊异和惶恐。这表情太明显了，怎能逃过我姐姐的观察。","The wonder and consternation with which Joe stopped on the threshold of his bite and stared at me, was too evident to escape my sister’s observation."
"“出什么事了？”她机敏地说道，同时放下了手中的茶杯。","“What’s the matter now?” said she, smartly, as she put down her cup."
"“我说，你可是知道的！”乔低声说，他冲我摇着脑袋，很严肃地抗议着，“皮普，老弟！你这样会让自己难受的。会卡住的。你不能直接吞下去的，皮普。”","“I say, you know!” muttered Joe, shaking his head at me in very serious remonstrance.“Pip, old chap!You’ll do yourself a mischief.It’ll stick somewhere.You can’t have chewed it, Pip.”"
"“到底发生什么事了？”我姐姐用更尖锐的声音重新问了一遍。","“What’s the matter now?” repeated my sister, more sharply than before."
"“如果你能咳一点出来的话，皮普，我劝你还是试试。”乔不知所措地说道，“礼仪固然是礼仪，可身体是你自己的啊。”","“If you can cough any trifle on it up, Pip, I’d recommend you to do it,” said Joe, all aghast.“Manners are manners, but still your elth’s your elth.”"
"这时我姐姐已经气急败坏了，她扑向乔，抓住他两边的络腮胡，把他的脑袋往他身后的墙上撞了好一阵子。我则坐在角落里，心中满是歉疚。 ","By this time, my sister was quite desperate, so she pounced on Joe, and, taking him by the two whiskers, knocked his head for a little while against the wall behind him: while I sat in the corner, looking guiltily on."
"“现在，或许你可以说说发生什么事了。”我姐姐上气不接下气地说，“你这头挨千刀的大呆猪。”","“Now, perhaps you’ll mention what’s the matter,” said my sister, out of breath, “you staring great stuck pig.”"
"乔无助地望着她，又无助地咬了一口面包，然后又看看我。","Joe looked at her in a helpless way; then took a helpless bite, and looked at me again."
"“你知道，皮普，”乔严肃地说，把最后一口面包放进嘴里，用秘密的语调跟我说，仿佛只有我们两个人一样，“你我永远都是朋友，无论任何时候，我都不会告发你的。不过像你那样——”他挪动了一下椅子，在我们两个中间的地上找了找，又继续对我说，“像你那样一口吞下去，太不正常了！”","“You know, Pip,” said Joe, solemnly, with his last bite in his cheek and speaking in a confidential voice, as if we two were quite alone, “you and me is always friends, and I’d be the last to tell upon you, any time.But such a—” he moved his chair and looked about the floor between us, and then again at me—“such a most on common Bolt as that!”"
"“他把面包一口吞下去了，是不是？”我姐姐嚷道。","“Been bolting his food, has he?” cried my sister."
"“你知道，老弟，”乔看着我而不是乔太太，说道，他嘴里还含着那最后一口面包，“我在你这个年纪时，也那样吞过——总是那么做——那时我就已经是个吞食高手了。但是我还没见过像你那么吞的，皮普。吞那么一大块都没被噎死，真是上帝仁慈啊。”","“You know, old chap,” said Joe, looking at me, and not at Mrs. Joe, with his bite still in his cheek, “I Bolted, myself, when I was your age—frequent—and as a boy I’ve been among a many Bolters; but I never see your Bolting equal yet, Pip, and it’s a mercy you aren’t Bolted dead.”"
"我姐姐冲到我面前，抓住我的头发像钓鱼一样把我拎起来，仅仅说了这样几个恐怖的字：“你给我过来，吃一剂药。”","My sister made a dive at me, and fished me up by the hair: saying nothing more than the awful words, “You come along and are dosed.”"
"在当时，某些江湖医生使柏油水作为一种良药流行起来。于是，乔太太的食柜里常常备有柏油水。柏油水又脏又恶心，而正因如此，乔太太相信其有很强的药效。哪怕是在情况最好的时候，我也喝下了不少这种被当成绝佳补品的灵丹妙药。这使得我四处走的时候，总觉得身上在散发出一股新筑成的篱笆的味道。在今晚这个特殊的时刻，我的情况非常紧急，需要喝上一品脱这种混合液。为了让我喝得舒服点，乔太太把我的头夹在她的胳肢窝下，用一种脱靴器拔靴子的姿势，将药水灌进了我的喉咙。乔只喝了半品脱，但却是被迫吞下这柏油水的（这让他很是烦心，他本坐在火炉前慢慢地咀嚼着面包，悠闲地思考着），“因为他刚刚受到了惊吓。”而在我看来，我得说如果刚才那次他没被吓到的话，这次他是着实受到了惊吓。","Some medical beast had revived Tar-water in those days as a fine medicine, and Mrs. Joe always kept a supply of it in the cupboard; having a belief in its virtues correspondent to its nastiness.At the best of times, so much of this elixir was administered to me as a choice restorative that I was conscious of going about, smelling like a new fence.On this particular evening the urgency of my case demanded a pint of this mixture, which was poured down my throat, for my greater comfort, while Mrs. Joe held my head under her arm, as a boot would be held in a boot-jack.Joe got off with half a pint; but was made to swallow that (much to his disturbance, as he sat slowly munching and meditating before the fire), “because he had a turn.”Judging from myself, I should say he certainly had a turn afterwards, if he had had none before."
"当男人或男孩受到良心谴责时，感觉会很糟糕。对一个男孩来说，这种秘密的包袱和另外一种他裤腿里的秘密的包袱叠加起来（我可以保证），绝对是个大大的惩罚。一来，我不得不去偷乔太太的东西——我从来没认为是乔的东西，因为我从不认为这家里的任何一件财产是他的——这让我产生负罪感；二来，无论我坐着还是被叫到厨房做事情，都不得不用一只手按住裤腿里的黄油面包，这两点让我快要疯了。那时，沼泽地吹来的风使得炉火烧得旺了起来，闪着刺眼的光，我觉得我听到外面传来了那个腿上绑着铁链的男人的声音，他曾让我发誓保守秘密。那个声音宣称他现在就要吃东西，他无法也不愿挨饿等到明天了。有时，我又会想到那个年轻人。那个男人花了好大力气才阻止他把侵犯的手伸向我，但要是他等得没有耐性了，或是弄错了时间，认为他应该在今晚而不是明天就来取我的心肝的话，我该怎么办！如果有谁曾经被吓得头发倒竖，那我当时一定也是这样了。但是，或许以前根本没有人被吓成这副样子。","Conscience is a dreadful thing when it accuses man or boy; but when, in the case of a boy, that secret burden cooperates with another secret burden down the leg of his trousers, it is (as I can testify) a great punishment.The guilty knowledge that I was going to rob Mrs. Joe—I never thought I was going to rob Joe, for I never thought of any of the housekeeping property as his—united to the necessity of always keeping one hand on my bread-and-butter as I sat, or when I was ordered about the kitchen on any small errand, almost drove me out of my mind.Then, as the marsh winds made the fire glow and flare, I thought I heard the voice outside, of the man with the iron on his leg who had sworn me to secrecy, declaring that he couldn’t and wouldn’t starve until tomorrow, but must be fed now.At other times, I thought, what if the young man who was with so much difficulty restrained from imbruing his hands in me, should yield to a constitutional impatience, or should mistake the time, and should think himself accredited to my heart and liver tonight, instead of tomorrow! If ever anybody’s hair stood on end with terror, mine must have done so then.But, perhaps, nobody’s ever done?"
"今天是圣诞前夜，我必须坐在荷兰大钟旁边，拿一根铜棒搅拌明天吃的布丁，从七点一直搅到八点。我手里干着活，同时感到腿上负担的重量（这又让我想到那个腿上绑着重物的男人）。我感觉手部的搅动快要把黄油面包从脚踝处震出来了，太难控制了。让人高兴的是，我终于可以脱身了，我的大半个心都已经跑到我的阁楼卧室了。","It was Christmas Eve, and I had to stir the pudding for next day, with a copper-stick, from seven to eight by the Dutch clock.I tried it with the load upon my leg (and that made me think afresh of the man with the load on his leg), and found the tendency of exercise to bring the bread-and-butter out at my ankle, quite unmanageable.Happily, I slipped away, and deposited that part of my conscience in my garret bedroom."
"“听！”我说，我搅拌好后，趁着还没被叫去睡觉，来到火炉旁再取个暖，“那是大炮的声音吗，乔？”","“Hark!” said I, when I had done my stirring, and was taking a final warm in the chimney corner before being sent up to bed; “was that great guns, Joe?”"
"“啊！”乔说，“又有犯人逃跑了。”","“Ah!” said Joe.“There’s another convict off.”"
"“那是什么意思，乔？”我说。","“What does that mean, Joe?” said I."
"乔太太总是喜欢主动解释说明，于是暴躁地说：“逃跑了。有人逃跑了。”她像灌柏油水一样向我灌输这种解释。","Mrs. Joe, who always took explanations upon herself, said, snappishly, “Escaped.Escaped.”Administering the definition like Tar-water."
"当乔太太低头做针线活的时候，我对着乔，做出口型：“什么是犯人？”乔也用嘴型给出了一个相当复杂的答案，我除了辨别出一个词“皮普”以外，什么都不明白。","While Mrs. Joe sat with her head bending over her needlework, I put my mouth into the forms of saying to Joe, “What’s a convict?”Joe put his mouth into the forms of returning such a highly elaborate answer, that I could make out nothing of it but the single word “Pip”."
"“昨晚有犯人逃跑了，”乔大声说，“在日落之后。“他们放炮警告大家有逃犯。现在似乎是放炮通告又有一个犯人逃走了。”","“There was a convict off last night,” said Joe, aloud, “after sun-set-gun.And they fired warning of him.And now, it appears they’re firing warning of another.”"
"“是谁在放炮？”我问。","“Who’s firing?” said I."
"“你这个小鬼真烦，”我姐姐一边干着针线活，一边对我皱着眉，插嘴说道，“真是个问题篓子。不要总问问题，问多了难免要受骗。”","“Drat that boy,” interposed my sister, frowning at me over her work, “what a questioner he is.Ask no questions, and you’ll be told no lies.”"
"我想我姐姐真是有些无理，即使我确实问了些问题，也不该暗示说我就应该因此被她骗啊。但是只要没有客人在，她总是这样无礼。","It was not very polite to herself, I thought, to imply that I should be told lies by her, even if I did ask questions.But she never was polite, unless there was company."
"这时，乔尽最大的努力把他的嘴张大，这更增强了我的好奇心。他做的口型在我看来像“生气”这个词。于是，我很自然地指指乔太太，然后做出口型说“她吗”？但是乔根本不理我，又一次把口型张得很大，非常用力地做出那个词语的口型。但我还是一点也不明白。","At this point, Joe greatly augmented my curiosity by taking the utmost pains to open his mouth very wide, and to put it into the form of a word that looked to me like “sulks.”Therefore, I naturally pointed to Mrs. Joe, and put my mouth into the form of saying “her?”But Joe wouldn’t hear of that, at all, and again opened his mouth very wide, and shook the form of a most emphatic word out of it.But I could make nothing of the word."
"“乔太太，”我决定最后试一次，问道，“我想知道——如果你不那么介意的话——是什么地方在放炮？”","“Mrs. Joe,” said I, as a last resource, “I should like to know—if you wouldn’t much mind—where the firing comes from?”"
"“愿主保佑这个孩子！”我姐姐大声叫道，仿佛她并不是真正想表达这个意思，而是正好相反。","“Lord blesses the boy!” exclaimed my sister, as if she didn’t quite mean that, but rather the contrary."
"“是监狱船！”","“From the Hulks!”"
"“哦！”我说，同时看着乔，“监狱船！”","“Oh-h!” said I, looking at Joe.“Hulks!”"
"乔责备似的咳嗽了一声，就像是在说：“我跟你说了嘛。”","Joe gave a reproachful cough, as much as to say, “Well, I told you so.”"
"“那请问什么是监狱船呢？”我说。","“And please what’s Hulks?” said I."
"“这孩子就是这样！”我姐姐叫道，用她的针线指着我，冲我摇着头，“回答他一个问题，他马上就再问你十几个。监狱船就是关押犯人的船，就在‘沼’的对面。”在我们村子里，人们总是用‘沼’这个词形容沼泽地。","“That’s the way with this boy!” exclaimed my sister, pointing me out with her needle and thread, and shaking her head at me.“Answer him one question, and he’ll ask you a dozen directly.Hulks are prison-ships, right ’cross th’ meshes.”We always used that name for marshes, in our country."
"“我想问是谁被关进监狱船，为什么把他们关在那里？”我问道，像往常一样表面平静，内心却急切地想知道。","“I wonder who’s put into prison-ships, and why they’re put there.” said I, in a general way, and with quiet desperation."
"这真是惹怒了乔太太，她猛地站了起来。“我告诉你，小家伙，”她说，“我一手把你拉扯大，可不是为了让你缠着人问问题的。如果我把你养成那样的话，别人都会骂我，而不是表扬我的。有人被关进监狱船，是因为他们杀人，因为他们抢劫、造假，做许许多多的坏事。而他们最开始学坏都是从爱问问题开始的。现在，你快去睡觉吧！”","It was too much for Mrs. Joe, who immediately rose.“I tell you what, young fellow,” said she, “I didn’t bring you up by hand to badger people’s lives out.It would be blame to me, and not praise, if I had.People are put in the Hulks because they murder, and because they rob, and forge, and do all sorts of bad; and they always begin by asking questions.Now, you get along to bed!”"
"我上楼睡觉时，姐姐从不允许我点蜡烛。当我在黑暗中上楼的时候，头感觉到阵阵刺痛——这是因为乔太太和我说最后那几句话时，用顶针敲我的头，仿佛敲小手鼓一样——她说的那几句话让我非常害怕，因为我很清楚监狱船离我近在咫尺。很明显，我已经在去那里的路上了。我已经开始喜欢问问题了，而且我又打算偷乔太太的东西。","I was never allowed a candle to light me to bed, and, as I went upstairs in the dark, with my head tingling—from Mrs. Joe’s thimble having played the tambourine upon it, to accompany her last words—I felt fearfully sensible of the great convenience that the Hulks were handy for me.I was clearly on my way there.I had begun by asking questions, and I was going to rob Mrs. Joe."
"虽然已经过去很久了，但从那时起，我就经常想，很少有人知道孩子在恐惧之下，心里藏着怎样的秘密。不论这恐惧多么不近乎情理，对孩子来说却是真正的恐惧。我很害怕那个想取我心肝的年轻人。我很害怕和我交谈的那个腿上绑着铁链的人。我很害怕我自己，因为我许下了一个可怕的誓言。我不指望我无所不能的姐姐来解救我，她每次总是把我拒之门外。现在每当我想起当年在心里秘密的恐惧之下，自己可能会做出怎样的事情时，仍会觉得很不安。","Since that time, which is far enough away now, I have often thought that few people know what secrecy there is in the young, under terror.No matter how unreasonable the terror, so that it be terror.I was in mortal terror of the young man who wanted my heart and liver; I was in mortal terror of my interlocutor with the ironed leg; I was in mortal terror of myself, from whom an awful promise had been extracted;I had no hope of deliverance through my all-powerful sister, who repulsed me at every turn; I am afraid to think of what I might have done, on requirement, in the secrecy of my terror."
"那天晚上，只要我一合眼，就会想象自己随着澎湃的浪潮顺流而下，向监狱船漂去。当我经过绞刑架时，一个幽灵般的海盗用喇叭向我呼喊着，让我最好靠岸，立刻接受绞刑，不要浪费时间。我非常害怕，即使我努力地想睡，却不敢睡着，因为我知道清晨第一道微微的曙光照亮时，我就必须去食品间偷东西了。夜里不能偷，因为那时还没有什么东西只要一擦，就能轻易地取到火。要想点着火，我就必须用火刀火石，制造出如同那个海盗身上的铁链般咔嗒咔嗒的噪音。","If I slept at all that night, it was only to imagine myself drifting down the river on a strong spring-tide, to the Hulks; a ghostly pirate calling out to me through a speaking-trumpet, as I passed the gibbet-station, that I had better come ashore and be hanged there at once, and not put it off.I was afraid to sleep, even if I had been inclined, for I knew that at the first faint dawn of morning I must rob the pantry.There was no doing it in the night, for there was no getting a light by easy friction then; to have got one, I must have struck it out of flint and steel, and have made a noise like the very pirate himself rattling his chains."
"当我窗外那黑丝绒一般的罩子透出一点灰光时，我就起床下楼了。沿路的每一块楼梯板，楼梯板上的每一处裂缝，都在我身后高喊：“站住，小偷！“乔太太，快起来！”在食品间，我发现因为季节的原因，食物比平时要丰富得多。我半转过身子时，突然被一只倒悬着的野兔吓了一跳，而且我确实觉得那只野兔在向我眨眼。我没时间证实，也没时间选择，什么事都来不及了，因为我实在是没有时间耽搁了。我偷了一些面包、一些干酪皮、半罐子碎肉（把这些和昨晚的那块面包一起包进一块手帕里），还从石酒坛里倒出一些白兰地（我把白兰地倒进一个小玻璃瓶里，这小瓶是我偷偷用来在楼上卧室制造能散发芳香的西班牙甘草水的。然后从厨房的食品柜里拿出水壶，把水灌进石酒坛里），还拿了一块没什么肉的骨头，和一块又圆又漂亮的猪肉馅饼。我本打算不拿馅饼就走的，但我还是试着爬上了架子，看看那只角落里盖得很严实的陶瓷碟子里倒底装了什么。结果我发现是一个馅饼，于是就拿了。我希望这不是马上就要用的，那样一时半会儿都没人会想起它。","As soon as the great black velvet pall outside my little window was shot with grey, I got up and went down stairs; every board upon the way, and every crack in every board, calling after me, “stop thief!”And “Get up, Mrs. Joe!”In the pantry, which was far more abundantly supplied than usual, owing to the season, I was very much alarmed, by a hare hanging up by the heels, whom I rather thought I caught, when my back was half turned, winking.I had no time for verification, no time for selection, no time for anything, for I had no time to spare.I stole some bread, some rind of cheese, about half a jar of mincemeat (which I tied up in my pocket-handkerchief with my last night’s slice), some brandy from a stone bottle (which I decanted into a glass bottle I had secretly used for making that intoxicating fluid, Spanish-liquorices-water, up in my room: diluting the stone bottle from a jug in the kitchen cupboard), a meat bone with very little on it, and a beautiful round compact pork pie.I was nearly going away without the pie, but I was tempted to mount upon a shelf, to look what it was that was put away so carefully in a covered earthen ware dish in a corner, and I found it was the pie, and I took it, in the hope that it was not intended for early use, and would not be missed for some time."
"厨房里有一个门和铁匠铺相连。我打开锁，拉开门闩，从乔的工具中拿出一把锉刀。然后，我把其他器具放回原处，打开昨晚我回家时走的那扇门，再关好，然后跑向那充满雾气的沼泽地。","There was a door in the kitchen, communicating with the forge; I unlocked and unbolted that door, and got a file from among Joe’s tools.Then, I put the fastenings as I had found them, opened the door at which I had entered when I ran home last night, shut it, and ran for the misty marshes."
"第三章","Chapter 3"
"那个清晨一片白霜,空气非常潮湿。早上起来时，我就看到小窗户的外侧覆盖着一层湿气，仿佛有个小妖精在那里哭了一整夜，把窗户当作了擦泪的手帕。此刻，我看到湿气凝结在光秃秃的树篱和稀疏的草地上，就像粗糙的蜘蛛网，挂在树枝之间和草叶之间。每家的栅栏和大门上都有一层湿冷的水汽。沼雾太浓，所以只有走到近前，我才看清柱子上那根指向我们村庄的木制手指——其实人们从来没有按手指的指向走过，因为人们从来不会来这里。然后，我抬头看着这根木制手指，它正在往下滴水珠。对我受压抑的良知来说，它好似一个幽灵，一心要把我奉献给监狱船。","It was a rimy morning, and very damp.I had seen the damp lying on the outside of my little window, as if some goblin had been crying there all night, and using the window for a pocket-handkerchief.Now, I saw the damp lying on the bare hedges and spare grass, like a coarser sort of spiders’ webs; hanging itself from twig to twig and blade to blade.On every rail and gate, wet lay clammy; and the marsh-mist was so thick, that the wooden finger on the post directing people to our village—a direction which they never accepted, for they never came there—was invisible to me until I was quite close under it.Then, as I looked up at it, while it dripped, it seemed to my oppressed conscience like a phantom devoting me to the Hulks."
"当我来到沼泽地时，雾气就更浓了。置身其中，仿佛眼前的一切向我迎面扑来而不是我向前走去。这对心怀负罪感的我来说是非常讨厌的。闸门、堤坝、河岸都突然冲破迷雾，向我逼近。它们仿佛极其清楚地喊道：“偷拿别人猪肉馅饼的小子！捉住他！”仿佛突然之间，牛群出现在我面前。每头牛都双目圆睁、鼻孔喷气，似乎在说：“嘿，小贼！”有一头黑色公牛，脖子上长了一圈白毛，就像戴着一条白色围巾。对于我被唤醒的良知来说，它有一种牧师的气场。这头牛的两眼死死地盯住我，我每动一下，它那愚钝的脑袋就随我动一下，一举一动之中满是指责。我只能朝它大声哭喊道：“先生，我是身不由己啊！我偷猪肉馅饼并不是为了我自己啊！”听到这些话，它低下头，从鼻孔里喷出一团雾气，踢了踢后腿，甩了甩尾巴，然后就消失不见了。","The mist was heavier yet when I got out upon the marshes, so that instead of my running at everything, everything seemed to run at me.This was very disagreeable to a guilty mind.The gates and dykes and banks came bursting at me through the mist, as if they cried as plainly as could be, “A boy with Somebody-else’s pork pie!Stop his!”The cattle came upon me with like suddenness, staring out of their eyes, and steaming out of their nostrils, “Hollow, young thief!”One black ox, with a white cravat on—who even had to my awakened conscience something of a clerical air—fixed me so obstinately with his eyes, and moved his blunt head round in such an accusatory manner as I moved round, that I blubbered out to him, “I couldn’t help it, sir!It wasn’t for myself I took it!”Upon which he put down his head, blew a cloud of smoke out of his nose, and vanished with a kick-up of his hind-legs and a flourish of his tail."
"自始至终我都在朝河边赶去，但无论我跑得有多快，我的双脚仍然冰冷。湿气紧紧地裹住我的脚，就像铁镣死死地铐住我飞奔过去要见的那个人的腿一样。我认识去炮台的路，一直走下去就是，因为之前的某个星期日，我曾和乔去过那里。当时乔坐在一尊老古炮上对我说，如果我签下长期合约成为他的固定学徒，那我们该有多高兴啊！然而，浓雾之中，我迷失了方向，最终发现自己已经偏右走了很远，结果不得不沿着河岸、踩着岸边的湿泥上那松动的石块和防汛木桩往回走。我全速沿河向前赶路。我跨过了一条小沟——我知道炮台离这里很近了——接着迅速爬上小沟那边的土丘，一上土丘，就看到那个人坐在我的前方。他背对着我，双臂交叉置于胸前。他正在熟睡当中，头部不时微微向前点动。","All this time, I was getting on towards the river; but however fast I went, I couldn’t warm my feet, to which the damp cold seemed riveted, as the iron was riveted to the leg of the man I was running to meet.I knew my way to the Battery, pretty straight, for I had been down there on a Sunday with Joe, and Joe, sitting on an old gun, had told me that when I was prentice to him regularly bound, we would have such Larks there!However, in the confusion of the mist, I found myself at last too far to the right, and consequently had to try back along the river-side, on the bank of loose stones above the mud and the stakes that staked the tide out.Making my way along here with all dispatch, I had just crossed a ditch which I knew to be very near the Battery, and had just scrambled up the mound beyond the ditch, when I saw the man sitting before me.His back was towards me, and he had his arms folded, and was nodding forward, heavy with sleep."
"我想，如果我出其不意地带着早餐出现在他面前的话，他一定会更高兴的。于是我轻轻地走上前去，拍了一下他的肩膀。他马上跳了起来，但结果竟不是我以为的那个人，而是另一个人！","I thought he would be gladder if I came upon him with his breakfast, in that unexpected manner, so I went forward softly and touched him on the shoulder.He instantly jumped up, and it was not the same man, but another man!"
"但是同样地，这个人也穿着灰色的粗线布衣，腿上铐着巨大的铁镣，走路一瘸一拐，嗓音粗哑、浑身冰冷。除了一张不同的面孔以及戴在头上的一只低顶宽边毡帽以外，他和我要见的那个人一模一样。所有这些都是我在片刻之间观察到的，因为我也只有这片刻的时间。随即他就对我破口大骂，挥拳攻击。所幸这一拳是弯着胳膊打来的，力量不大，不但没有击中我，反而差点把他自己带倒。然后他跌跌撞撞地冲进大雾之中，绊倒了两次，之后就消失了。","And yet this man was dressed in coarse grey, too, and had a great iron on his leg, and was lame, and hoarse, and cold, and was everything that the other man was; except that he had not the same face, and had a flat broad-brimmed low-crowned felt that on.All this, I saw in a moment, for I had only a moment to see it in: he swore an oath at me, made a hit at me—it was a round weak blow that missed me and almost knocked himself down, for it made him stumble—and then he ran the mist, stumbling twice as he went, and I lost him."
"“他就是那个年轻人！”我这样想着，同时由于认出了他，我感到心脏一阵剧痛。我敢说，要是我知道肝脏是长在哪里的话，我肯定也会感到那里疼的。","“It’s the young man!” I thought, feeling my heart shoot as I identified him.I dare say I should have felt a pain in my liver, too, if I had known where it was."
"很快我就来到了炮台。一到那里就看到我要见的那个人在那等我。他紧抱着自己的身体，一瘸一拐地走来走去，仿佛已经这样持续了一整夜而丝毫没有合眼——一直这样等着我。他一定是太冷了。我几乎预感到他会由于严寒在我面前倒地而死。同时，他的眼神中也流露出极度饥饿的神情。看到他把我递过去的锉刀随手丢在草地上，我突然觉得要不是看到我手中的食品包，他一定连锉刀也吃。这次他没有把我倒立起来搜个底朝天，然后拿走我所有的东西，而是让我自己打开食品包，掏空口袋。","I was soon at the Battery, after that, and there was the right man-hugging himself and limping to and fro, as if he had never all night left off hugging and limping—waiting for me.He was awfully cold, to be sure.I half expected to see him drop down before my face and die of deadly cold.His eyes looked so awfully hungry, too, that when I handed him the file and he laid it down on the grass, it occurred to me he would have tried to eat it, if he had not seen my bundle.He did not turn me upside down, this time, to get at what I had, but left me right side upwards while I opened the bundle and emptied my pockets."
"“小子，瓶子里装的是什么？”他问道。","“What’s in the bottle, boy?” said he."
"“白兰地。”我答道。","“Brandy,” said I."
"此时他已经在往嘴里猛塞碎肉了，那种奇怪的吃法让他看起来不像是在吃东西而是在匆忙而粗暴地将碎肉囤积在某个地方。但得知有白兰地之后，他丢开碎肉，开始喝酒。他一直都在颤抖，由于颤抖得非常厉害，所以他能把瓶颈咬在牙齿之间而没有把它咬断就已经很不容易了。","He was already handing mincemeat down his throat in the most curious manner—more like a man who was putting it away somewhere in a violent hurry, than a man who was eating it—but he left off to take some of the liquor.He shivered all the while, so violently, that it was quite as much as he could do to keep the neck of the bottle between his teeth, without biting it off."
"“我想你是染上了疟疾。”我说道。","“I think you have got the ague,” said I."
"“小子，我觉得多半是被你说中了。”他答道。","“I’m much of your opinion, boy,” said he."
"“这儿条件太差了。”我对他说，“你一直都躺在沼泽地上，很容易染上疟疾的。还有风湿病。”","“It’s bad about here,” I told him.“You’ve been lying out on the meshes, and they’re dreadful aguish.Rheumatic too.”"
"“就算他们会要了我的命也得等我把早餐吃完再说。”他说道，“即使眼下我马上要被送上绞刑架绞死，我还是要先吃完早餐。我敢和你打赌，我会战胜这些颤抖。”","“I’ll eat my breakfast afore they’re the death of me,” said he.“I’d do that, if I was going to be strung up to that there gallows as there is over there, directly afterwards.I’ll beat the shivers so far, I’ll bet you.”"
"他狼吞虎咽，把碎肉、肉骨、面包、奶酪以及猪肉馅饼一起往嘴里塞。同时还疑神疑鬼地环视我们四周的迷雾，常常停下来，甚至停止咀嚼，侧耳静听。也许是某种真实的声音或是他幻想中的声音，也许是河面上的叮当声或沼地里野兽的喘息声让他下了一跳，他突然问道：","He was gobbling mincemeat, meat bone, bread, cheese, and pork pie, all at once: staring distrustfully while he did so at the mist all round us, and often stopping—even stopping his jaws—to listen.Some real or fancied sound, some clink upon the river or breathing of beast upon the marsh, now gave him a start, and he said, suddenly: "
"“你不会是个招摇撞骗的小鬼吧？你没带其他人来吧？”","“You’re not a deceiving imp?You brought no one with you?”"
"“没有，先生！绝对没有！”","“No, sir!No!”"
"“也没有给任何人留下线索来跟踪你吧？”","“Nor give no one the office to follow you?”"
"“没有！”","“No!”"
"“好吧，”他说道，“我相信你。如果你小小年纪就帮着别人追捕一个落魄的可怜鬼，尤其是像我这样离死期不远、就快腐烂发臭的穷鬼，那你无疑就成了一条凶狠的小猎狗了！”","“Well,” said he, “I believe you.You’d be but a fierce young hound indeed; if at your time of life you could help to hunt a wretched war mint, hunted as near death and dunghill as this poor wretched war mint is!”"
"他喉咙里有什么东西咔嗒响了一下，仿佛他身体里有座钟，马上就要敲响一样。接着他用破烂的粗布衣袖擦了擦眼睛。","Something clicked in his throat, as if has works in him like a clock, and was going to strike.And he smeared his ragged rough sleeve over his eyes."
"看到他这般凄凉，我很是同情。看着他又开始吃猪肉馅饼，我鼓足了勇气对他说:“我很高兴你喜欢吃这个馅饼。”","Pitying his desolation, and watching him as he gradually settled down upon the pie, I made bold to say, “I am glad you enjoy it.”"
"“你说什么？”","“Did you speak?”"
"“我说我很高兴你喜欢吃这个馅饼。”","“I said I was glad you enjoyed it.”"
"“谢谢你，我的孩子。我的确喜欢吃这个馅饼。”我以前时常看着我们家的一只大狗吃东西。现在我发现，这个人的吃法与那只狗的吃法简直是太相像了。这个人猛地用力咬上几口,就像狗一样。每一口食物他都是吞下去的，不，分明是抢着往里塞，吃得太快太急了。吃的时候，他看看这边，瞅瞅那边，仿佛认定四面八方都隐藏着危险，随时会有人跳出来抢走他的馅饼一样。我想他如此心神不宁，肯定无法好好享受这个馅饼。要是有人和他一起进食，他非咬掉来者一块肉不可。所有这些细节都让他和那只狗更加相像了。","“Thanked, my boy.I do.”I had often watched a large dog of ours eating his food; and I now noticed a decided similarity between the dog’s way of eating, and the man’s.The man took strong sharp sudden bites, just like the dog.He swallowed, or rather snapped up, every mouthful, too soon and too fast; and he looked sideways here and there while he ate, as if he thought there was danger in every direction, of somebody’s coming to take the pie away.He was altogether too unsettled in his mind over it, to appreciate it comfortably, I thought, or to have anybody to dine with him, without making a chop with his jaws at the visitor.In all of which particulars he was very like the dog."
"“恐怕你不会给他留一点了。”我小心翼翼地说。说前我迟疑了很久，不知道这样说有没有礼貌。“我只能弄到这么多食物了。”这是千真万确的，所以我才不得不跟他说。","“I am afraid you won’t leave any of it for him,” said I, timidly; after a silence during which I had hesitated as to the politeness of making the remark.“There’s no more to be got where that came from.”It was the certainty of this fact that impelled me to offer the hint."
"“给他留点？他是谁？”我的朋友正在咀嚼馅饼皮，听到我的话，停了下来反问我。","“Leave any for him?Who’s him?” said my friend, stopping in his crunching of pie-crust."
"“那个年轻人。你说起过的那个。他和你躲藏在一起。”","“The young man.That you spoke of.That was hid with you.”"
"“噢！”他发出一声粗鲁的笑声，回答道，“他？　对，对！他不吃东西的。”","“Oh ah!” he returned, with something like a gruff laugh.“Him?Yes, yes!He don’t want no witless.”"
"“我觉得他看起来还是要吃东西的。”我说道。","“I thought he looked as if he did,” said I."
"这个人停下了咀嚼，用最尖锐、最诧异的目光审视着我。","The man stopped eating, and regarded me with the keenest scrutiny and the greatest surprise."
"“看起来？什么时候？”","“Looked?When?”"
"“刚刚。”","“Just now.”"
"“在哪里？”","“Where?”"
"“那边，”我用手指着回答道，“就在那边，我看到他坐在那里打瞌睡，我还以为是你。”","“Yonder,” said I, pointing; “over there, where I found him nodding asleep, and thought it was you.”"
"他一把抓住我的衣领，死死地盯着我。我开始觉得他又有了起初那个割断我喉咙的打算。","He held me by the collar and stared at me so, that I began to think his first idea about cutting my throat had revived."
"“穿得很想你，只不过多戴了顶帽子。”我颤抖着向他解释道，“而且——而且”——我急切地想说得委婉一些——“而且你们俩借来锉刀都是为了相同的目的。难道昨天夜里你没有听见炮声吗？”","“Dressed like you, you know, only with a hat,” I explained, trembling; “and—and”—I was very anxious to put this delicately—“and with—the same reason for wanting to borrow a file.Didn’t you hear the cannon last night?”"
"“哦，那的确是炮声！”他自言自语道。","“Then, there was firing!” he said to himself."
"“我很奇怪你怎么就不确定那是炮声呢。”我回答说，“我们住得更远一些，关在屋里都可以听到。”","“I wonder you shouldn’t have been sure of that,” I returned, “for we heard it up at home, and that’s further away, and we were shut in besides.”"
"“唉，听我说！”他说道，“当一个人独自在这沼地，脑袋昏昏沉沉，胃里空无一物，缺衣少食、饥寒难耐的时候，整晚听到的都是枪声和喊声。只是听见么？他还看到士兵向他团团包围过来。士兵手中的火把，照亮了他们身上的红色军服。他听见自己的编号被叫到，听见自己被质问，听见火枪咔咔的响声，听见军令声‘弟兄们，各就各位！举枪！瞄准他！’接着他就被捉住了——他们也消失了！哎呀，我昨天夜里看见一个搜捕队。他们整齐有序地行进，他妈的，发出沉重的脚步声，我看见有一百人呢。至于炮声嘛！哎，大炮把雾气都震得发颤，那时候天已经亮了——但这个人，”他滔滔不绝，仿佛已经忘记了我的存在，“你察觉到他有什么异常吗？”","“Why, see now!” said he.“When a man’s alone on these flats, with a light head and a light stomach, perishing of cold and want, he hears nothing all night, but guns firing, and voices calling.Hears?He sees the soldiers, with their red coats lighted up by the torches carried afore, closing in round him.Hears his number called, hears himself challenged, hears the rattle of the muskets, hears the orders ‘Make ready!Present!Cover him steady, men!’And is laid hands on—and there’s nothing!Why, if I see one pursuing party last night—coming up in order, Damn ’em, with their tramp, tramp—I see a hundred.And as to firing!Why, I see the mist shake with the cannon, arter it was broad day—But this man,” he had said all the rest, as if he had forgotten my being there; “did you notice anything in him?”"
"“他的脸上有严重的擦伤。”我说道，想起了这一个我自己都几乎不知道我曾注意到的细节。","“He had a badly bruised face,” said I, recalling what I hardly knew I knew."
"“不是在这里吗？”这个人用手掌狠狠地扇了自己的左脸颊，高声喊道。","“Not here?” exclaimed the man, striking his left cheek mercilessly, with the flat of his hand."
"“对，就是那里！”","“Yes, there!”"
"“他现在在哪里？”他将仅剩的一点食物包好，塞进他灰色夹克的胸口处。“给我指一下他往哪个方向去了。我要像一只猎犬一样追上他。这该死的铁镣，让我的腿痛得不行！小子，把锉刀拿来。”","“Where is he?”He crammed what little food was left, into the breast of his grey jacket.“Show me the way he went.I’ll pull him down, like a bloodhound.Curse this iron on my sore leg!Give us hold of the file, boy.”"
"我给他指出了那个人消失在大雾之中的方向，他抬起头望了片刻。然后他就坐在茂盛、潮湿的草地上，发疯般地锉他的铁镣，毫不在意一旁的我或是他自己的腿。他腿上有一处旧伤，现在已经是血淋淋的，但他对此毫不在意，仿佛那条腿和锉刀一样没有知觉。我再一次对他感到非常害怕。现在他已经变得心急火燎了，而且我也担心自己离家的时间太久了。我告诉他我必须走了，但他根本没有听见。所以我想我最好还是悄悄地溜走。我看他最后一眼的时候，他正低着头，冲着膝盖，拼命地锉铁镣，嘴里不耐烦地咒骂着铁镣和他的腿。我最后听见他的声音时，我在迷雾之中停下了脚步，仔细聆听，那还是他锉脚镣的声音。","I indicated in what direction the mist had shrouded the other man, and he looked up at it for an instant.But he was down on the rank wet grass, filing at his iron like a madman, and not minding me or minding his own leg, which has an old chafe upon it and was bloody, but which he handled as roughly as if it had no more feeling in it than the file.I was very much afraid of him again, now that he had worked himself into this fierce hurry, and I was likewise very much afraid of keeping away from home any longer.I told him I must go, but he took no notice, so I thought the best thing I could do was to slip off.The last I saw of him, his head was bent over his knee and he was working hard at his fetter, muttering impatient imprecations at it and at his leg.The last I heard of him, I stopped in the mist to listen, and the file was still going."
"第四章","Chapter 4"
"我满以为厨房里会有一个警察，在那里等着逮捕我。然而不仅没有警察，而且没有人发现我偷拿了东西。乔太太正在为过节布置房屋，忙得不可开交。乔被支到了厨房门阶上，从而让他离簸箕远一点。不过像往常一样，他早晚还是会跑到簸箕那边添乱。此时我姐姐正在起劲地扫地。","I fully expected to find a Constable in the kitchen, waiting to take me up.But not only was there no Constable there, but no discovery had yet been made of the robbery.Mrs. Joe was prodigiously busy in getting the house ready for the festivities of the day, and Joe had been put upon the kitchen door-step to keep him out of the dust-pan—an article into which his destiny always led him sooner or later, when my sister was vigorously reaping the floors of her establishment."
"“你刚刚究竟跑到哪里去了？”当我满心愧疚地回到家时，乔太太给我的圣诞问候就是这句话。","“And where the deuce have you been?” was Mrs. Joe’s Christmas salutation, when I and my conscience showed ourselves?"
"我说我跑去听圣诞颂歌了。“哦！那就好！”乔太太说道，“我以为你又跑去闯祸了。”我寻思着，真被她说中了。","I said I had been down to hear the Carols.“Ah! well!” observed Mrs. Joe.“You might ha’ done worse.”Not a doubt of that, I thought."
"“要不是我嫁给了铁匠，整天像个奴隶一样戴着围裙忙来忙去的话，我也早就去听圣诞颂歌了。”乔太太说道，“我特别喜欢独自听颂歌，这正是我从没有去听过颂歌的最佳理由。”","“Perhaps if I wasn’t a blacksmith’s wife, and (what’s the same thing) a slave with her apron never off, I should have been to hear the Carols,” said Mrs. Joe.“I’m rather partial to Carols, myself, and that’s the best of reasons for my never hearing any.”"
"乔壮着胆子尾随我进了厨房，簸箕在我们进来之前就被拿走了。乔太太瞪了乔一眼，乔就用手背擦了擦鼻子，做出想和解的姿态。当乔太太的目光转移到别处时，乔就偷偷地朝我做了个两根食指交叉的手势。这是我们的暗号，表示乔太太心情很差。她总是心情很差，我和乔时常一连几个星期都十指交叉，就像伟大的十字军战士们交叉的双腿一样。","Joe, who had ventured into the kitchen after me as the dust-pan had retired before us, drew the back of his hand across his nose with a conciliatory air when Mrs. Joe darted a look at him, and, when her eyes were withdrawn, secretly crossed his two forefingers, and exhibited them to me, as our token that Mrs. Joe was in a cross temper.This was so much her normal state that Joe and I would often, for weeks together, be, as to our fingers, like monumental Crusaders as to their legs."
"我们的午餐将会非常丰盛，有青菜烧腌猪腿和一对八宝烤鸡。昨天早上已经做好了一个很大的肉末馅饼，所以我偷拿碎肉的事还没有被发现。布丁也已经开始蒸了。这些大量的准备工作蛮横地挤掉了我们的早餐。“我可没有时间，”乔太太说，“眼下我要忙的事情够多的了，我可没有时间另外给你们准备好吃的、好喝的，替你们洗洗涮涮了。别指望了！”","We were to have a superb dinner, consisting of a leg of pickled pork and greens, and a pair of roast stuffed fowls.A handsome mince-pie had been made yesterday morning (which accounted for the mincemeat not being missed), and the pudding was already on the boil.These extensive arrangements occasioned us to be cut off unceremoniously in respect of breakfast; “for I ain’t,” said Mrs. Joe, “I ain’t a-going to have no formal cramming and busting and washing up now, with what I’ve got before me, I promise you!”"
"所以，我们只能吃几片面包来充饥。我们看起来不是呆在家里的大人和孩子，而是正被迫行军中的两千名士兵。同时我们一脸歉意地拿起橱柜上的罐子，大口大口地喝着牛奶和水。此时，乔太太挂起了洁白的窗帘，在宽大的壁炉四周钉上新的花边，换下了旧花边。她同时还打开了走廊上的小客厅。这个比较正式的小客厅平时从不打开，常年笼罩在锡箔纸蒙胧的寒光之中。这寒光甚至一直照到壁炉台上四只小巧玲珑的白色瓷制鬈毛狗身上。每只鬈毛狗都顶着个黑鼻头，嘴里叼着花篮，四只一模一样。乔太太是个非常爱干净的家庭主妇，但她却有本事让她的干净比灰尘本身更让人不自在，让人受不了。干净往往与虔诚联系在一起，有些人出于信仰而非常爱干净。","So, we had our slices served out, as if we were two thousand troops on a forced march instead of a man and boy at home; and we took gulps of milk and water, with apologetic countenances, from a jug on the dresser.In the meantime, Mrs. Joe put clean white curtains up, and tacked a new flowered-flounce across the wide chimney to replace the old one, and uncovered the little state parlor across the passage, which was never uncovered at any other time, but passed the rest of the year in a cool haze of silver paper, which even extended to the four little white crockery poodles on the mantelshelf, each with a black nose and a basket of flowers in his mouth, and each the counterpart of the other.Mrs. Joe was a very clean housekeeper, but had an exquisite art of making her cleanliness more uncomfortable and unacceptable than dirt itself.Cleanliness is next to Godliness, and some people do the same by their religion."
"我姐姐总是有很多事要做，所以只能“间接”去教堂，也就是说，由我和乔替她去。穿着工作服，乔就是一个身膀结实、很有个性的铁匠；而穿上节日服装，他更像一个装扮一新的稻草人。那时他身上穿的所有衣服都不适合他，看起来根本不是他的衣服，他穿的每一件衣服都会把他擦伤。在这个充满节日气氛的时刻，随着欢快的钟声响起，他带着痛苦的表情走出房间，就像一个要去教堂做忏悔的人。至于我，我觉得我姐姐基本上认为我天生就是个小罪犯，就好像一生下来就被警察逮捕，然后交给了她，要她根据我触犯的法律来惩治我。一直以来我都被看作是一个违背理性、宗教、道德的指示，且不顾好友劝阻，执意要来到这个世界上的人。就连带我去做一身新衣服，都要让裁缝做出一套类似少年犯管教所里的行头，绝对不让我自由活动四肢。","My sister having so much to do was going to church vicariously; that is to say, Joe and I were going.In his working clothes, Joe was a well-knit characteristic-looking blacksmith; in his holiday clothes, he was more like a scarecrow in good circumstances, than anything else.Nothing that he wore then, fitted him or seemed to belong to him; and everything that he wore then, grazed him.On the present festive occasion he emerged from his room, when the blithe bells were going, the picture of misery, in a full suit of Sunday penitential.As to me, I think my sister must have had some general idea that I was a young offender whom an Accouter Policemen had taken up (on my birthday) and delivered over to her, to be dealt with according to the outraged majesty of the law.I was always treated as if I had insisted on being born, in opposition to the dictates of reason, religion, and morality, and against the dissuading arguments of my best friends.Even when I was taken to have a new suit of clothes, the tailor had orders to make them like a kind of Reformatory, and on no account to let me have the free use of my limbs."
"因此，我和乔去教堂这件事在那些充满怜悯之心的人看来，一定是令人大为感动的景象。然而，这些来自外部的痛苦与我内心的折磨相比简直是微不足道。每当乔太太走近食品间或走出房间时，我都极度恐惧。与这种恐惧一样折磨着我的是，一想起自己做过的事我就非常懊悔。这个不可告人的秘密重重地压在我的心头。我思忖着，要是我去忏悔，教堂能不能有足够的力量保护我免遭那个可怕的年轻人的报复。我打算，在结婚预告宣读完毕，牧师宣布“如有异议可陈述己见”的时候，我就要站起来要求与牧师到祈祷室去密谈。只不过这天是圣诞节而不是礼拜日，否则我说不定真会采取这种极端的做法，让为数不多的全体教堂会众大吃一惊。","Joe and I going to church, therefore, must have been a moving spectacle for compassionate minds.Yet, what I suffered outside was nothing to what I underwent within.The terrors that had assailed me whenever Mrs. Joe had gone near the pantry, or out of the room, were only to be equaled by the remorse with which my mind dwelt on what my hands had done.Under the weight of my wicked secret, I pondered whether the Church would be powerful enough to shield me from the vengeance of the terrible young man, if I divulged to that establishment.I conceived the idea that the time when the banns were read and when the clergyman said, “Ye are now to declare it!” would be the time for me to rise and propose a private conference in the vestry.I am far from being sure that I might not have astonished our small congregation by resorting to this extreme measure, but for its being Christmas Day and no Sunday."
"教堂执事沃甫赛先生要来我们家吃饭，另外还有车匠哈布尔先生和他的太太还有彭波契克舅舅。彭波契克舅舅理应是乔的舅舅，但乔太太却也喊他是舅舅。他是邻镇上一个有钱的粮商，拥有一辆轻便马车。吃饭时间是下午一点半。当我和乔回到家时，我们发现餐桌已经布置妥当，乔夫人打扮好了，菜肴已经开始准备了，正门开着迎接客人的到来，要知道，平时这扇门是从不打开的。一切看上去都好极了。到目前为止，还没有任何关于失窃的消息。","Mr. Wopsle, the clerk at church, was to dine with us; and Mr. Hubble the wheelwright and Mrs. Hubble; and Uncle Pumblechook (Joe’s uncle, but Mrs. Joe appropriated him), who was a well-to-do corn-chandler in the nearest town, and drove his own chaise-cart.The dinner hour was half-past one.When Joe and I got home, we found the table lay, and Mrs. Joe dressed, and the dinner dressing, and the front door unlocked (it never was at any other time) for the company to enter by, and everything most splendid.And still, not a word of the robbery."
"午饭时间到了，但这并没有让我感到如释重负。客人们也都来了。沃甫赛先生长了个鹰钩鼻和一个硕大的、闪闪发光的秃脑门。他的嗓音低沉，对此他特别骄傲。的确，认识他的人都知道，如果任其发挥，他读经文比牧师读得都好。他自己也认为，如果教会举行公开竞选的话，他一定会成功当选。然而教会并不举行公开竞选，所以正如我之前所说的，他只是个执事。但是他很不喜欢大家总是附和“阿门”；当他诵读赞美诗时——总是一下子读一整节——他先要环视一下教堂里的会众，仿佛是在说：“你们已经听到我天上的朋友的声音，请对我这种风格提出你们的意见！”","The time came, without bringing with it any relief to my feelings, and the company came.Mr. Wopsle, united to a Roman nose and a large shining bald forehead, had a deep voice which he was uncommonly proud of; indeed it was understood among his acquaintance that if you could only give him his head, he would read the clergyman into fits; he himself confessed that if the Church was “thrown open,” meaning to competition, he would not despair of making his mark in it.The Church not being “thrown open,” he was, as I have said, our clerk.But he punished the Amens tremendously; and when he gave out the psalm—always giving the whole verse—he looked all round the congregation first, as much as to say, “You have heard my friend overhead; oblige me with your opinion of this style!”"
"我为来客们开门，以使他们相信我们平时也总开着这扇大门。我开门迎接的第一个人是沃甫赛先生，接着是哈布尔先生和他的太太，最后是彭波契克舅舅。注意，我是不能喊他舅舅的，否则会受到严厉的惩罚。","I opened the door to the company—making believe that it was a habit of ours to open that door—and I opened it first to Mr. Wopsle, next to Mr. and Mrs. Hubble, and last of all to Uncle Pumblechook.N.B., I was not allowed to call him uncle, under the severest penalties."
"彭波契克舅舅是个魁梧的中年人，行动迟缓、呼吸急促，嘴巴长得像鱼嘴，双目圆睁却目光呆滞，头上立着沙褐色的头发，这些让他看起来就好像是刚刚被噎到了，才缓过来一样。“乔太太，”他说道，作为节日的问候，太太，我给您带来一瓶雪莉酒。太太，我还给您带来一瓶波尔图葡萄酒。”","“Mrs. Joe,” said Uncle Pumblechook: a large hard-breathing middle-aged slow man, with a mouth like a fish, dull staring eyes, and sandy hair standing upright on his head, so that he looked as if he had just been all but choked, and had that moment come to; “I have brought you, as the compliments of the season—I have brought you, Mum, a bottle of sherry wine—and I have brought you, Mum, a bottle of port wine.”"
"每年圣诞节他都会出现，讲同样的话，带来两个哑铃一样的酒瓶，而他却认为这很有创意。每年圣诞节，乔太太就像眼下这样回答他：“噢，彭——波——契克舅舅！您太客气了！”每年圣诞节，他都像眼下这样回敬道：“比起您来还是差远了。你们现在都身体安好吗？那个小东西怎么样了？”“小东西”指的是我。","Every Christmas Day he presented himself, as a profound novelty, with exactly the same words, and carrying the two bottles like dumb-bells.Every Christmas Day, Mrs. Joe replied, as she now replied, “Oh, Un—cle Pum—ble—chook!This is kind!”Every Christmas Day, he retorted, as he now retorted, “It’s no more than your merits.And now are you all bobbish, and how’s Sixpennorth of halfpence?”Meaning me."
"每年过节我们都在厨房吃饭，吃完后换到客厅去吃坚果、桔子、苹果。从厨房换到客厅给人的感觉就像看到乔把工作服换成节日礼服一样。我姐姐眼下非常愉快。的确，她与哈布尔太太在一起比和其他人在一起的时候更加和蔼可亲。我记得哈布尔太太身材娇小，头发卷曲，面部轮廓清晰，穿着天蓝色的衣服。她看起来仍是个传统的少女模样，因为她嫁给了比自己大得多的哈布尔先生。但我不知道他们是多久之前结的婚。我记得哈布尔先生是个身体健壮、肩膀高高、有点驼背的老头，身上散发出锯屑的香气，走路时两腿叉开得很大。所以在我个头还很矮的时候，如果路上见他迎面走来，我能从他叉开的两腿之间看到几英里以外的乡间旷野。","We dined on these occasions in the kitchen, and adjourned, for the nuts and oranges and apples, to the parlor; which was a change very like Joe’s change from his working clothes to his Sunday dress.My sister was uncommonly lively on the present occasion, and indeed was generally more gracious in the society of Mrs. Hubble than in other company.I remember Mrs. Hubble as a little curly sharp-edged person in sky-blue, who held a conventionally juvenile position, because she had married Mr. Hubble—I don’t know at what remote period—when she was much younger than he.I remember Mr. Hubble as a tough high-shouldered stooping old man, of a saw dusty fragrance, with his legs extraordinarily wide apart: so that in my short days I always saw some miles of open country between them when I met him coming up the lane."
"身处这些宾客之中，我感到即使我没有从食品间里偷东西，自己还是与他们格格不入。不是因为我被挤到了桌角，桌子高过我的胸口，而且彭波契克的胳膊肘总是碰到我的眼睛；不是因为他们不许我说话，其实我本来就不想说话；也不是因为他们用来招待我的都是些带着鳞皮的鸡爪尖，以及那些不知取自猪身上哪个部位，连猪生前都觉得不值得夸耀的肉。不，都不是因为这些，如果他们能让我自己呆着，我根本就不在乎这些。可他们就是不让我自己好好呆着。他们似乎认为，如果不时时地把对话引向我，拿我当话柄的话，就再也没有这个机会了。我就像西班牙斗牛场上的一头不幸的小公牛，被这些看似道德的刺棒打得遍体鳞伤。","Among this good company I should have felt myself, even if I hadn’t robbed the pantry, in a false position.Not because I was squeezed in at an acute angle of the table-cloth, with the table in my chest, and the Pumblechookian elbow in my eye, nor because I was not allowed to speak (I didn’t want to speak), nor because I was regaled with the scaly tips of the drumsticks of the fowls, and with those obscure corners of pork of which the pig, when living, had had the least reason to be vain.No; I should not have minded that, if they would only have left me alone.But they wouldn’t leave me alone.They seemed to think the opportunity lost, if they failed to point the conversation at me, every now and then, and stick the point into me.I might have been an unfortunate little bull in a Spanish arena, I got so startlingly touched up by these moral goads."
"这种折磨从我们一坐下来吃饭就开始了。沃甫赛先生像念剧本台词似的大声做饭前祷告，我现在回想起来觉得那就像是《哈姆雷特》和《理查三世》中的幽灵结合成了一个教徒。最后沃甫赛先生希望大家能诚心感恩，祷告结束。这时我姐姐就紧盯着着我，用责备的口吻低声说道：“听到了吗？要感恩。”","It began the moment we sat down to dinner.Mr. Wopsle said grace with theatrical declamation—as it now appears to me, something like a religious cross of the Ghost in Hamlet with Richard the Third—and ended with the very proper aspiration that we might be truly grateful.Upon which my sister fixed me with her eye, and said, in a low reproachful voice, “Do you hear that?Be grateful.”"
"“孩子，”彭波契克先生说道，“特别是要感谢那些亲手把你养大的人啊。”","“Especially,” said Mr. Pumblechook, “be grateful, boy, to them which brought you up by hand.”"
"哈布尔太太摇了摇头，问道：“为什么现在的年轻人都不知道感恩呢？”同时她看着我，好像已经悲哀地预感到，我将来也好不到哪里去。这个道德谜团似乎难住了所有人，直到最后哈布尔先生简短的一句话解决了这个难题：“他们天生如此败坏。”所有人随即小声说道：“的确如此！”同时用极其不悦并极具攻击性的眼神看着我。","Mrs. Hubble shook her head, and contemplating me with a mournful presentiment that I should come to no good, asked, “Why is it that the young are never grateful?”This moral mystery seemed too much for the company until Mr. Hubble tersely solved it by saying, “Naturally vicious.”Everybody then murnured “True!” and looked at me in a particularly unpleasant and personal manner."
"有客人在的时候，乔即使有地位和影响力，也比没有外人的时候小得多。但他总是以他自己的方式尽可能地帮助我、安慰我。吃饭的时候，如果有肉汁，他就不停地给我肉汁，作为对我的安慰。今天饭桌上有很多肉汁，此刻乔用勺子往我盘子里舀了差不多半品脱。","Joe’s station and influence were something feebler (if possible) when there was company, than when there was none.But he always aided and comforted me when he could, in some way of his own, and he always did so at dinner-time by giving me gravy, if there were any.There being plenty of gravy today, Joe spooned into my plate, at this point, about half a pint."
"吃了一会儿，沃甫赛先生开始严厉地批评牧师的布道词，同时一如既往地表示，如果教会进行公开竞选的话，他会给予会众多么好的布道词。吹嘘了一番之后，他又评论说今天讲道的主题选得太差了。他说，好的主题很多，这种糟糕的选择实在是不可原谅的。","A little later on in the dinner, Mr. Wopsle reviewed the sermon with some severity, and intimated—in the usual hypothetical case of the Church being “thrown open”—what kind of sermon he would have given them.After favoring them with some heads of that discourse, he remarked that he considered the subject of the day’s homily, ill-chosen; which was the less excusable, he added, when there were so many subjects “going about.”"
"“千真万确。”彭波契克舅舅说道，“您真是一语中的，先生！是有很多主题，对他们来说是要懂得如何抓住这些主题。这才是最重要的。如果诱饵准备妥当，一个人根本不用走太远就能找到猎物。”　彭波契克先生想了一会儿接着说道：“就看这猪肉，这就是个主题！　如果你要找个布道主题，猪肉就是一个！”","“True again,” said Uncle Pumblechook.“You’ve hit it, sir!Plenty of subjects going about, for them that know how to put salt upon their tails.That’s what’s wanted.A man needn’t go far to find a subject, if he’s ready with his salt-box.”Mr. Pumblechook added, after a short interval of reflection, “Look at Pork alone.There’s a subject!If you want a subject, look at Pork!”"
"“确实是这样的，先生。对年轻人来说太有寓意了。”沃甫赛先生答道，他没有说完我就知道他又要把话题转移到我身上了，“他们能从中得到很多教训。”","“True, sir.Many a moral for the young,” returned Mr. Wopsle; and I knew he was going to lug me in, before he said it; “might be deduced from that text.”"
"“你好好听着。”我姐姐十分严厉地对我说。乔又给我舀了些肉汁。","(“You listen to this,” said my sister to me, in a severe parenthesis.) Joe gave me some more gravy."
"“猪，”沃甫赛先生用他深沉的嗓音继续说道，同时拿叉子指着我已经羞得通红的脸，仿佛他正在喊我的教名，“猪是挥霍浪费者的同伴。猪贪吃的下场已经摆在了我们面前，年轻人应该引以为戒。”（我觉得有趣的是，他刚刚还夸这猪肉肥厚多汁呢。）“猪身上令人厌恶的毛病放在一个男孩子身上就更加让人讨厌了。”","“Swine,” pursued Mr. Wopsle, in his deepest voice, and pointing his fork at my blushes, as if he were mentioning my Christian name; “Swine were the companions of the prodigal.The gluttony of Swine is put before us, as an example to the young.”(I thought this pretty well in him who had been praising up the pork for being so plump and juicy.) “What is detestable in a pig, is more detestable in a boy.”"
"“女孩也一样。”哈布尔先生提示说。","“Or girl,” suggested Mr. Hubble."
"“当然，女孩也一样，哈布尔先生。”沃甫赛先生表示同意，但一脸怒气，“但这里没有女孩子。”","“Of course, or girl, Mr. Hubble,” assented Mr. Wopsle, rather irritably, “but there is no girl present.”"
"“另外，”彭波契克先生迅速转向我说道，“想想你所拥有的值得感恩的一切。如果你生来就是个爱哭鬼——”","“Besides,” said Mr. Pumblechook, turning sharp on me, “think what you’ve got to be grateful for.If you’d been born a Squeaker—” "
"“他就是个爱哭鬼，世间少有这样的孩子。”我姐姐断然答道。","“He was, if ever a child was,” said my sister, most emphatically."
"乔又给我舀了些肉汁。","Joe gave me some more gravy."
"“好吧，不过我说的是四只脚的爱哭鬼。”彭波契克先生说，“如果你生来是那样的话，你现在还能坐在这里吗？　你不会的——”","“Well, but I mean a four-footed Squeaker,” said Mr. Pumblechook.“If you had been born such, would you have been here now?Not you—” "
"“除非以那种形式。”沃甫赛先生说着朝盘子中的猪肉点了点头。","“Unless in that form,” said Mr. Wopsle, nodding towards the dish."
"“但我不是那个意思，先生。”彭波契克先生回答道，他很反感自己说话时被打断，“我的意思是，和大人长辈一起快乐地生活，在大人长辈的教导中进步，生活优裕、养尊处优。他能拥有这些吗？　不，他不能。那么你的命运会是怎样的呢？”他又转向我。“根据市场物价，你会被出售，换回很多先令。屠夫邓恩斯·泰布会朝你躺着的稻草堆走过来，他会把你夹在左胳膊下，用右手撩起衣服，从背心口袋里掏出一把小刀，然后放你的血，要你的命。那时就没有人亲手把你养大了。一个人也没有！”","“But I don’t mean in that form, sir,” returned Mr. Pumblechook, who had an objection to being interrupted; “I mean, enjoying himself with his elders and betters, and improving himself with their conversation, and rolling in the lap of luxury.Would he have been doing that?No, he wouldn’t.And what would have been your destination?”Turning on me again.“You would have been disposed of for so many shillings according to the market price of the article, and Duns table the butcher would have come up to you as you lay in your straw, and he would have whipped you under his left arm, and with his right he would have tucked up his frock to get a penknife from out of his waistcoat-pocket, and he would have shed your blood and had your life.No bringing up by hand then.Not a bit of it!”"
"乔给我舀了更多的肉汁，我却不敢吃。","Joe offered me more gravy, which I was afraid to take."
"“太太，他一定给你惹来不少麻烦。”哈布尔太太对我姐姐同情地说道。","“He was a world of trouble to you, ma’am,” said Mrs. Hubble, commiserating my sister."
"“麻烦？”我姐姐附和道，“只有麻烦而已吗？”然后就开始了那令人厌烦的长篇大论，细数我染上的种种疾病，醒着的时候干下的种种坏事，曾经从哪些高处摔了下来，又跌进哪些低洼的地方，自作自受受了多少伤，以及一直以来她都希望我干脆死了算了，但我就是不让她如愿。","“Trouble?” echoed my sister; “trouble?” and then entered on a fearful catalogue of all the illnesses I had been guilty of, and all the acts of sleeplessness I had committed, and all the high places I had tumbled from, and all the low places I had tumbled into, and all the injuries I had done myself, and all the times she had wished me in my grave, and I had contumaciously refused to go there."
"我想罗马人一定是因为他们的鼻子而激怒了彼此。也许正是因此，他们最后成了一个不安分的民族。不管怎样，在我姐姐数落我的种种罪行时，沃甫赛先生的鼻子让我万分恼怒。我真想一把扯住他的鼻子，直到他大声嚎叫为止。我姐姐数落完之后出现了片刻的沉默。沉默当中我痛苦地感觉到，所有人都用满是愤怒和厌恶的眼神看着我。但到目前为止，我所承受的一切与沉默打破之后我糟糕的心情相比简直是微不足道。","I think the Romans must have aggravated one another very much, with their noses.Perhaps, they became the restless people they were, in consequence.Anyhow, Mr. Wopsle’s Roman nose so aggravated me, during the recital of my misdemeanors that I should have liked to pull it until he howled.But, all I had endured up to this time, was nothing in comparison with the awful feelings that took possession of me when the pause was broken which ensued upon my sister’s recital, and in which pause everybody had looked at me (as I felt painfully conscious) with indignation and abhorrence."
"“但是，”彭波契克先生轻声地将大家带回之前背离的主题，“烹煮过的猪肉也是很有滋味的，不是吗？”","“Yet,” said Mr. Pumblechook, leading the company gently back to the theme from which they had strayed, “Pork—regarded as billed—is rich, too; isn’t it?”"
"“喝点白兰地吧，舅舅。”我姐姐说道。","“Have a little brandy, uncle,” said my sister."
"天哪，这下大祸临头了！他会发现白兰地太淡了，他会说这酒怎么这么淡，那样我就完了。我两只手紧紧地抓住桌布下的桌腿，等待着厄运的到来。","O Heavens, it had come at last!He would find it was weak, he would say it was weak, and I was lost!I held tight to the leg of the table under the cloth, with both hands, and awaited my fate."
"我姐姐去取石酒坛。取回酒坛，给他满上白兰地，其他人一点也没喝。这个可恶的家伙摆弄着他的酒杯，举起来，对着光看看，再放下，这些都延长了我痛苦的时间。同时，乔太太和乔迅速地清理了饭桌，准备端上馅饼和布丁。","My sister went for the stone bottle, came back with the stone bottle, and poured his brandy out: no one else taking any.The wretched man trifled with his glass—took it up, looked at it through the light, put it down—prolonged my misery.All this time, Mrs. Joe and Joe were briskly clearing the table for the pie and pudding."
"我没法把目光从他身上移开。我的手脚一齐紧紧地抱住桌腿。我看着那可恶的家伙用手指打趣地划过酒杯，举起来，笑了笑，一仰头，将白兰地喝了下去。随后即刻之间，客人们就陷入了不可名状的惊愕当中，因为他跳了起来，转了几圈，身体抽搐，又喊又咳，手舞足蹈，让人大为震惊。接着他冲出门去，透过窗户可以看见他猛地俯下身去大口地往外咳着什么，面部表情扭曲难看，完全疯掉了一样。","I couldn’t keep my eyes off him.Always holding tight by the leg of the table with my hands and feet, I saw the miserable creature finger his glass playfully, take it up, smile, throw his head back, and drink the brandy off.Instantly afterwards, the company were seized with unspeakable consternation, owing to his springing to his feet, turning round several times in an appalling spasmodic whooping-cough dance, and rushing out at the door; he then became visible through the window, violently plunging and expectorating, making the most hideous faces, and apparently out of his mind."
"我紧紧地抱着桌腿，乔太太和乔跑了过去。我不知道自己是怎么做到的，但不管怎样，我确信是我谋害了他。","I held on tight, while Mrs. Joe and Joe ran to him.I didn’t know how I had done it, but I had no doubt I had murdered him somehow."
"我惊恐万分，之后他被带了回来，我松了一口气。他审视着周围的客人，仿佛是他们跟他过不去，接着倒在椅子上，重重地喘了一口气，说：“柏油水！”","In my dreadful situation, it was a relief when he was brought back, and, surveying the company all round as if they had disagreed with him, sank down into his chair with the one significant gasp, “Tar!”"
"我往酒坛里倒的是柏油水。我知道他之后会觉得越来越难受。由于抓得太紧，我挪动了一下桌子，就像如今的巫师，用看不见的力量挪动一个物体。","I had filled up the bottle from the tar-water jug.I knew he would be worse by-and-by.I moved the table, like a Medium of the present day, by the vigor of my unseen hold upon it."
"“柏油水！”我姐姐惊讶地喊道，“什么，柏油水怎么跑到酒坛里去了？”","“Tar!” cried my sister, in amazement.“Why, how ever could Tar come there?”"
"然而，彭波契克舅舅此时就是这间厨房里万能的主。他不想再听见这个词，不想再提起这个话题，蛮横地一挥手，表示不要再说了，并要热的杜松子酒水。","But, Uncle Pumblechook, who was omnipotent in that kitchen, wouldn’t hear the word, wouldn’t hear of the subject, imperiously waved it all away with his hand, and asked for hot gin-and-water."
"我姐姐从惊慌和思考中回过神来，赶紧去取来杜松子酒、热水、糖和柠檬皮，并把它们混合在一起。至少眼下我是得救了。我仍然抱着桌腿，但这次是心怀感激地抱着它。","My sister, who had begun to be alarmingly meditative, had to employ herself actively in getting the gin, the hot water, the sugar, and the lemon-peel, and mixing them.For the time being at least, I was saved.I still held on to the leg of the table, but clutched it now with the fervor of gratitude."
"逐渐地，我镇静下来，松开了手，开始吃布丁。彭波契克先生吃起了布丁。大家都开始吃布丁。","By degrees, I became calm enough to release my grasp and partake of pudding.Mr. Pumblechook partook of pudding.All partook of pudding."
"甜食吃完了，彭波契克先生在杜松子酒水的帮助下，脸上开始泛起了红光。我开始觉得我能熬过今天了。突然我姐姐对乔说：“去拿干净的盘子来，冷盘子。”","The course terminated, and Mr. Pumblechook had begun to beam under the genial influence of gin-and-water.I began to think I should get over the day, when my sister said to Joe, “Clean plates—cold.”"
"我马上又抓住了桌腿，把它紧紧地贴在胸前，仿佛它是我儿时的伙伴、灵魂的密友一样。我能预见即将发生的事情，我感觉这次真的完了。","I clutched the leg of the table again immediately, and pressed it to my bosom as if it had been the companion of my youth and friend of my soul.I foresaw what was coming, and I felt that this time I really was gone."
"“你们一定要尝尝，”我姐姐和颜悦色地对客人说道，“在宴会结束之前，你们一定要尝尝彭波契克舅舅带来的令人愉悦的美味礼品！”","“You must taste,” said my sister, addressing the guests with her best grace, “You must taste, to finish with, such a delightful and delicious present of Uncle Pumblechook’s!”"
"必须要他们尝尝吗！还是不要让他们尝吧！","Must they!Let them not hope to taste it!"
"“你们得知道，”我姐姐站起来说道，“是一个馅饼，一个美味的猪肉馅饼。”","“You must know,” said my sister, rising, “it’s a pie; a savory pork pie.”"
"客人们小声地恭维着。彭波契克舅舅觉得，考虑到之前发生的事情，自己是客人当中最该享用馅饼的人，所以异常活跃地说道：“好吧，乔太太，我们会好好享用的，让我们共享一个馅饼吧。”","The company murmured their compliments.Uncle Pumblechook, sensible of having deserved well of his fellow-creatures, said—quite vivaciously, all things considered—“Well, Mrs. Joe, we’ll do our best endeavors; let us have a cut at this same pie.”"
"我姐姐出去取馅饼了。我听见她走向食品间的脚步声。我看到彭波契克先生摆弄着餐刀。我从沃甫赛先生的鹰勾鼻鼻孔中看出他重新燃起的食欲。我听见哈布尔先生评论道：“一点猪肉馅饼是你所能提及的最好的东西了，而且没有害处。”我还听见乔说：“你也吃点，皮普。”我从来都不十分确定我只是从内心发出了惊恐的一声尖叫，还是真的发出了所有人都听得见的尖叫。我感觉我再也受不了了，我必须逃跑。我松开了桌腿，没命似的逃走了。","My sister went out to get it.I heard her steps proceed to the pantry.I saw Mr. Pumblechook balance his knife.I saw re-awakening appetite in the Roman nostrils of Mr. Wopsle.I heard Mr. Hubble remark that “a bit of savory pork pie would lay atop of anything you could mention, and do no harm,” and I heard Joe say, “You shall have some, Pip.”I have never been absolutely certain whether I uttered a shrill yell of terror, merely in spirit, or in the bodily hearing of the company.I felt that I could bear no more, and that I must run away.I released the leg of the table, and ran for my life."
"但我刚刚跑到大门口就一头扎进一队士兵当中。他们都扛着火枪。一个士兵递给我一副手铐，说道：“在这里啊，看起来挺机灵的，快来！”","But, I ran no further than the house door, for there I ran head foremost into a party of soldiers with their muskets: one of whom held out a pair of handcuffs to me, saying, “Here you are, look sharp, come on!”"
"第五章","Chapter 5"
"这队士兵幽灵般地出现在我们家门口，哗啦啦地放下他们装满子弹的火枪，枪托搁在地上。这使客人们惊慌地从饭桌旁站了起来。乔太太空手回到了厨房，本来在疑惑地惋惜道：“天哪，馅饼——哪里——去了！”一看到这种场面，就立刻停了下来，变得目瞪口呆。","The apparition of a file of soldiers ringing down the butt-ends of their loaded muskets on our door-step, caused the dinner-party to rise from table in confusion, and caused Mrs. Joe re-entering the kitchen empty-handed, to stop short and stare, in her wondering lament of “Gracious goodness gracious me, what’s gone—with the—pie!”"
"当乔太太还呆若木鸡时，我和中士已经在厨房了。在这样一个危急时刻，我反而冷静了一些。刚刚跟我说话的就是这个中士，现在他正巡视客人。他左手搭在我的肩膀上，右手拿着手铐向他们扬了扬。","The sergeant and I were in the kitchen when Mrs. Joe stood staring; at which crisis I partially recovered the use of my senses.It was the sergeant who had spoken to me, and he was now looking round at the company, with his handcuffs invitingly extended towards them in his right hand, and his left on my shoulder."
"“打扰了，女士们，先生们，”中士说道，“但是就像我刚刚在门口对这个机灵的小伙子说过的一样（其实他根本没说什么），我接受国王的命令进行追捕，我想找铁匠。”","“Excuse me, ladies and gentleman,” said the sergeant, “but as I have mentioned at the door to this smart young shaver” (which he hadn’t), “I am on a chase in the name of the king, and I want the blacksmith.”"
"“您找他有什么事啊？”我姐姐听说要找铁匠，立刻愤愤不平地反问道。","“And pray what might you want with him?” retorted my sister, quick to resent his being wanted at all."
"“太太，”中士殷勤地说道，“对我自己来说，今天能认识铁匠的太太乃是我的荣幸。对国王来说，他需要找铁匠做点事情。”","“Missis,” returned the gallant sergeant, “speaking for myself, I should reply, the honor and pleasure of his fine wife’s acquaintance; speaking for the king, I answer, a little job done.”"
"中士回答得简洁明了，连彭波契克先生都大声说道：“说得好！”","This was received as rather neat in the sergeant; insomuch that Mr. Pumblechook cried audibly, “Good again!”"
"“你看，铁匠师傅，”中士说道，这时他已经一眼认出了乔，“这些出了点故障。我发现其中一个环的锁坏了，而且两个环之间的连接部也不好使了。因为我们马上要用，你能帮我们看一下吗？”","“You see, blacksmith,” said the sergeant, who had by this time picked out Joe with his eye, “we have had an accident with these, and I find the lock of one of ’em goes wrong, and the coupling don’t act pretty.As they are wanted for immediate service, will you throw your eye over them?”"
"乔看了一眼，然后说道，要修理必须先生起风炉，要花上一个多小时将近两个小时的时间。","Joe threw his eye over them, and pronounced that the job would necessitate the lighting of his forge fire, and would take nearer two hours than one."
"“真的吗？那你能马上开始修吗，铁匠师傅？”中士不假思索地说道，“毕竟这是为国王效劳。如果我的部下能帮上任何忙的话，他们可供使唤。”说完这话，他叫来了他的部下。士兵一个接一个地列队进入厨房，把兵器堆放在一个角落里。然后他们就闲站在那里——士兵都会这样，一会儿把手松散地放在身前，一会儿放松了膝盖或肩膀，一会儿松了松腰带和子弹袋，一会儿打开门朝院子里吐口痰，虽然他们的衣领又高又硬。","“Will it? Then will you set about it at once, blacksmith?” said the off-hand sergeant, “as it’s on his Majesty’s service.And if my men can beat a hand anywhere, they’ll make themselves useful.”With that, he called to his men, who came trooping into the kitchen one after another, and piled their arms in a corner.And then they stood about, as soldiers do; now, with their hands loosely clasped before them; now, resting a knee or a shoulder; now, easing a belt or a pouch; now, opening the door to spit stiffly over their high stocks, out into the yard."
"所有这些我都看在眼里，但当时我无心顾及这些，因为那时我极度忧虑。但我开始渐渐意识到，手铐并不是用来逮捕我的，而且军队的出现占了上风，馅饼的事已经被丢到了一边，我也更理智一些了。","All these things I saw without then knowing that I saw them, for I was in an agony of apprehension.But, beginning to perceive that the handcuffs were not for me, and that the military had so far got the better of the pie as to put it in the background, I collected a little more of my scattered wits."
"“你能告诉我现在几点吗？”中士对彭波契克先生说道。中士是个有鉴别力的人，这种能力让他断定，彭波契克先生肯定知道时间。“刚刚两点半。”","“Would you give me the time?” said the sergeant, addressing himself to Mr. Pumblechook, as to a man whose appreciative powers justified the inference that he was equal to the time.“It’s just gone half-past two.”"
"“不算太晚，”中士想了想说，“即使我还得在这里耽搁两个小时也没关系。你们知道从沼泽地到这里还有多远？我想不超过一英里吧？”","“That’s not so bad,” said the sergeant, reflecting; “even if I was forced to halt here nigh two hours, that’ll do.How far might you call yourselves from the marshes, hereabouts?Not above a mile, I reckon?”"
"“刚好一英里。”乔太太说。","“Just a mile,” said Mrs. Joe."
"“来得及。","“That’ll do."
"我们大约在黄昏时分开始朝那里进发。我接到的命令是在黄昏之前出发。这也来得及。”“是追捕逃犯么，中士？”沃甫赛先生例行公事般地问道。","We begin to close in upon ’em about dusk.A little before dusk, my orders are.That’ll do.”“Convicts, sergeant?” asked Mr. Wopsle, in a matter-of-course way."
"“嗯！”中士回答道，“两名逃犯。我们非常确定，他们还在沼泽地那里。而且黄昏之前他们不会从那里逃走。这里有谁见过他们吗？”","“Ay!” returned the sergeant, “two.They’re pretty well known to be out on the marshes still, and they won’t try to get clear of ’em before dusk.Anybody here saw anything of any such game?”"
"除了我之外，每个人都肯定地说没有见过。没人想到我会见过逃犯。","Everybody, myself excepted, said no, with confidence.Nobody thought of me."
"“那就好！”中士说道，“我预料他们不久就会被包围，比他们自己预想的还要早。好了，铁匠师傅！如果你准备好了，国王陛下的军队在此任你调遣。”","“Well!” said the sergeant, “they’ll find themselves trapped in a circle, I expect, sooner than they count on.Now, blacksmith!If you’re ready, his Majesty the King is.”"
"乔已经脱下了外套和背心，解下了围巾，穿上了他的皮围裙，走进了铁匠铺。一名士兵打开木窗，一名士兵生起火，另外一名士兵拉起了风箱，其余的站在火炉四周。不一会儿，炉火就熊熊燃烧起来。然后乔开始叮叮当当地敲打，我们都在一旁看着。","Joe had got his coat and waistcoat and cravat off, and his leather apron on, and passed into the forge.One of the soldiers opened its wooden windows, another lighted the fire, another turned to at the bellows, the rest stood round the blaze, which was soon roaring.Then Joe began to hammer and clink, hammer and clink, and we all looked on."
"即将进行的追捕激起了大家的兴趣，这不仅吸引了大家的注意力，甚至让我姐姐也大方起来了。她从酒桶中舀出一罐啤酒给士兵们喝，然后邀请中士喝一杯白兰地。但是彭波契克先生厉声说道：“给他喝葡萄酒吧，太太。我想葡萄酒里不会有柏油水吧。”于是，中士对他表示了感谢，并说他希望自己的酒里不会有柏油水，要是方便的话，他就喝葡萄酒。拿到葡萄酒后，他祝愿国王身体健康，祝愿大家节日愉快，然后一口喝了下去，使劲咂了咂嘴。","The interest of the impending pursuit not only absorbed the general attention, but even made my sister liberal.She drew a pitcher of beer from the cask, for the soldiers, and invited the sergeant to take a glass of brandy.But Mr. Pumblechook said, sharply, “Give him wine, Mum.I’ll engage there’s no Tar in that:” so, the sergeant thanked him and said that as he preferred his drink without tar, he would take wine, if it was equally convenient.When it was given him, he drank his Majesty’s health and Compliments of the Season, and took it all at a mouthful and smacked his lips."
"“是好酒吧，嗯，中士？”彭波契克先生说道。","“Good stuff, eh, sergeant?” said Mr. Pumblechook. "
"“我告诉你，”中士回答说，“我猜想这是你带来的吧。”","“I’ll tell you something,” returned the sergeant; “I suspect that stuff’s of your providing.”"
"彭波契克先生大笑了一声，说道：“噢，噢，你怎么知道？”","Mr. Pumblechook, with a fat sort of laugh, said, “Ay, ay?Why?”"
"“因为，”中士拍着他的肩膀说，“你是个识货的人。”","“Because,” returned the sergeant, clapping him on the shoulder, “you’re a man that knows what’s what.”"
"“你这样觉得吗？”彭波契克先生说道，同时发出之前那样的笑声。“再喝一杯！”","“Dye think so?” said Mr. Pumblechook, with his former laugh.“Have another glass!”"
"“和你一起喝。干杯。”中士回答说，“杯底碰杯头，杯头碰杯底，碰一次，碰两次，碰杯的声音最好听！祝你健康。愿你活到一千岁，愿你永远像现在一样有明智的判断力！”","“With you.Hob and knob,” returned the sergeant.“The top of mine to the foot of yours—the foot of yours to the top of mine—Ring once, ring twice—the best tune on the Musical Glasses!Your health.May you live a thousand years, and never be a worse judge of the right sort than you are at the present moment of your life!”"
"中士一仰头又喝了一杯，而且看上去还想再喝一杯。我注意到，热情好客的彭波契克先生似乎忘了这瓶葡萄酒是他送给别人的礼物，反而从乔太太手里接过酒瓶，愉快地给所有人斟酒，抢走了所有的风头。连我都喝到了一点葡萄酒。他非常慷慨地拿出葡萄酒，第一瓶喝完之后，又要来一瓶，同样很大方地给大家斟酒。","The sergeant tossed off his glass again and seemed quite ready for another glass.I noticed that Mr. Pumblechook in his hospitality appeared to forget that he had made a present of the wine, but took the bottle from Mrs. Joe and had all the credit of handing it about in a gush of joviality.Even I got some.And he was so very free of the wine that he even called for the other bottle, and handed that about with the same liberality, when the first was gone."
"当我看着他们所有人站在铁匠铺中，兴高采烈地聚集一团时，我就想起沼泽地里那个逃亡的朋友，他成了这次宴会极好的调味料。要是没有他带来的刺激，他们压根不会像现在这样兴致勃勃。此时此刻，他们都热切地期盼捕获这两名逃犯。风箱似乎为追捕逃犯而怒吼，火苗似乎为追捕逃犯而熊熊燃烧，浓烟似乎已匆忙去追赶他们了。乔在为追捕逃犯而叮当敲打，墙面上阴暗的黑影在朝他们舞动，发出恐吓，火光起起伏伏，炽热的火星跌落下来化为灰烬。在我满是同情与幼稚幻想的心看来，因为他们这两个可怜人，外面的下午都变得惨淡起来。","As I watched them while they all stood clustering about the forge, enjoying themselves so much, I thought what terrible good sauce for a dinner my fugitive friend on the marshes was.They had not enjoyed themselves a quarter so much, before the entertainment was brightened with the excitement he furnished.And now, when they were all in lively anticipation of “the two villains” being taken, and when the bellows seemed to roar for the fugitives, the fire to flare for them, the smoke to hurry away in pursuit of them, Joe to hammer and clink for them, and all the murky shadows on the wall to shake at them in menace as the blaze rose and sank and the red-hot sparks dropped and died, the pale afternoon outside, almost seemed in my pitying young fancy to have turned pale on their account, poor wretches."
"最终，乔的工作完成了，一切叮当声、怒吼声都停止了。乔穿上大衣后，鼓足勇气提议说，我们中的几个人应跟随士兵一起出发，看看追捕的结果。彭波契克先生和哈布尔先生以自己要抽烟并要参加妇女活动为借口拒绝前往。但沃甫赛先生说只要乔去，他就去。乔说他很乐意去，而且如果乔太太允许的话，他可以带我去。要不是乔太太出于好奇想知道详细过程和结果的话，我肯定她一定不会让我们去的。尽管如此，她还是规定：“如果你把这孩子带回来时，他的脑袋已经被火枪打开了花，那时候别指望我再把它补好。”","At last, Joe’s job was done, and the ringing and roaring stopped.As Joe got on his coat, he mustered courage to propose that some of us should go down with the soldiers and see what came of the hunt.Mr. Pumblechook and Mr. Hubble declined, on the plea of a pipe and ladies’ society; but Mr. Wopsle said he would go, if Joe would.Joe said he was agreeable, and would take me, if Mrs. Joe approved.We never should have got leave to go, I am sure, but for Mrs. Joe’s curiosity to know all about it and how it ended.As it was, she merely stipulated, “If you bring the boy back with his head blown to bits by a musket, don’t look to me to put it together again.”"
"中士礼貌地与女士们道别，并且就像一位志同道合的同志一样与彭波契克先生道别，尽管我很怀疑如果在不喝酒的情况下，中士是否还会像现在一样看到彭波契克先生的优点。他的部下重新拾起火枪，列队站好。我和乔还有沃甫赛先生都接到了严格的命令，我们只能跟在队尾，而且到了沼泽地之后不能说话。我们在阴冷的空气当中稳步朝目的地行进。这时我有点邪恶地小声对乔说：“乔，我希望我们找不到他们。”乔小声回答我说：“皮普，要是他们砍断脚镣逃跑了的话，我就输一个先令。”","The sergeant took a polite leave of the ladies, and parted from Mr. Pumblechook as from a comrade; though I doubt if he were quite as fully sensible of that gentleman’s merits under arid conditions, as when something moist was going.His men resumed their muskets and fell in.Mr. Wopsle, Joe, and I, received strict charge to keep in the rear, and to speak no word after we reached the marshes.When we were all out in the raw air and were steadily moving towards our business, I treasonably whispered to Joe, “I hope, Joe, we shan’t find them.”And Joe whispered to me, “I’d give a shilling if they had cut and run, Pip.”"
"村子里没有流浪汉跑来加入我们，因为天气寒冷、险恶，路途枯燥无味，脚下的路不好走。黑夜马上就来临了，人们都在屋内生着火欢度这个节日。几张面孔匆匆地贴在光亮的窗户上望着我们，但没人走出屋来。我们走过了指路牌，朝教堂墓地一直走去。在那里，中士做了个手势，示意我们停下几分钟。两三个士兵散布到墓穴间巡查，同时也巡查了门廊。他们毫无发现地归队。然后我们穿过教堂墓地旁边的大门，向广阔的沼泽地挺进。这时，乘东风之势，猛烈的雨夹雪向我们打来。乔把我背了起来。","We were joined by no stragglers from the village, for the weather was cold and threatening, the way dreary, the footing bad, darkness coming on, and the people had good fires in-doors and were keeping the day.A few faces hurried to glowing windows and looked after us, but none came out.We passed the finger-post, and held straight on to the churchyard.There, we were stopped a few minutes by a signal from the sergeant’s hand, while two or three of his men dispersed themselves among the graves, and also examined the porch.They came in again without finding anything, and then we struck out on the open marshes, through the gate at the side of the churchyard.A bitter sleet came rattling against us here on the east wind, and Joe took me on his back."
"现在我们到了这荒凉的野外。他们绝对想不到，我八九个小时之前来过这里，而且看到了两个藏身在此的人。这时我才第一次无比恐惧地意识到，如果我们看到逃犯，那个我接触过的逃犯会不会认为是我把士兵带来的？他之前问过我是不是个招摇撞骗的小鬼，而且他还说过，要是我参与到对他的追捕当中，我就是一条凶狠的小猎狗。","Now that we were out upon the dismal wilderness where they little thought I had been within eight or nine hours and had seen both men hiding, I considered for the first time, with great dread, if we should come upon them, would my particular convict suppose that it was I who had brought the soldiers there?He had asked me if I was a deceiving imp, and he had said I should be a fierce young hound if I joined the hunt against him."
"他会不会认为我既是个骗子又是一条极度奸诈的猎狗，最终背叛了他？现在问自己这个问题已经没用了。眼下我趴在乔的背上，乔背着我像猎人一样跨过路上的沟渠，同时激励沃甫赛先生跟上我们，不要摔坏他的鹰钩鼻。士兵走在我们前面，拉开一条很宽的阵势，人与人之间保持一定的间隔。我们现在走的正是我早上走的那条路，当时我在大雾之中偏离了方向。现在，要么大雾还没有再次弥漫开来，要么风已经把雾吹散了。在落日低低的红色光芒之中，灯塔、绞刑架、炮台的土丘以及河对岸都清晰可见，尽管它们都笼罩在一层淡淡的铅灰色之下。","Would he believe that I was both imp and hound in treacherous earnest, and had betrayed him?It was of no use asking myself this question now.There I was, on Joe’s back, and there was Joe beneath me, charging at the ditches like a hunter, and stimulating Mr. Wopsle not to tumble on his Roman nose, and to keep up with us.The soldiers were in front of us, extending into a pretty wide line with an interval between man and man.We were taking the course I had begun with, and from which I had diverged in the mist.Either the mist was not out again yet, or the wind had dispelled it.Under the low red glare of sunset, the beacon, and the gibbet, and the mound of the Battery, and the opposite shore of the river, were plain, though all of a watery lead color."
"我的心贴在乔宽大的肩膀上，就像铁匠打铁般咚咚地跳。我四下望去，寻找着逃犯的踪迹。我一点踪迹也没看到，什么声音也没听到。沃甫赛先生的喘息声和重重的呼吸声不止一次地让我非常恐慌。但现在我知道那是他的声音，能够把他们与所追捕的逃犯的声音区分开来。突然，我好像听见锉铁镣的声音，我非常震惊，但仔细一听，发现那只不过是羊身上的铃铛在响。羊群停止吃草，胆怯地看着我们。寒风雨雪之中，牛群扭过头来愤怒地瞪着我们，仿佛认为这令人厌恶的寒风雪雨都是我们带来的。但除了这些以及残阳之中每片草叶的颤动声之外，没有什么打破沼泽地上荒凉的寂静。","With my heart thumping like a blacksmith at Joe’s broad shoulder, I looked all about for any sign of the convicts.I could see none, I could hear none.Mr. Wopsle had greatly alarmed me more than once, by his blowing and hard breathing; but I knew the sounds by this time, and could dissociate them from the object of pursuit.I got a dreadful start, when I thought I heard the file still going; but it was only a sheep bell.The sheep stopped in their eating and looked timidly at us; and the cattle, their heads turned from the wind and sleet, stared angrily as if they held us responsible for both annoyances; but, except these things, and the shudder of the dying day in every blade of grass, there was no break in the bleak stillness of the marshes."
"士兵在朝古炮台的方向挺进，我们跟在他们后面不远。突然，我们所有人都停了下来。因为，风雨之中，传来一声长长的喊声。接着又一声喊声。喊声从东边远远地传来，但拖得很长，声音很大。不仅如此，根据声音的混乱判断，似乎是两个甚至更多的人在一起喊。","The soldiers were moving on in the direction of the old Battery, and we were moving on a little way behind them, when, all of a sudden, we all stopped.For, there had reached us on the wings of the wind and rain, a long shout.It was repeated.It was at a distance towards the east, but it was long and loud.Nay, there seemed to be two or more shouts raised together—if one might judge from a confusion in the sound."
"听到这种喊声，我和乔赶到队伍前面。这时中士正和他身边的士兵低声讨论着。又仔细听了一会儿之后，判断力很好的乔赞同了不止有一个人在喊的说法。判断力很差的沃甫赛先生也赞同了这种说法。中士很果断，他命令不许回应这一喊声，而应改变行进路线，命令士兵以双倍的速度向喊声发出的地方行进。于是我们斜向右跑去（也就是往东跑）。乔跑得飞快，我必须抓紧才不会从他背上摔下来。","To this effect the sergeant and the nearest men were speaking under their breath, when Joe and I came up.After another moment’s listening, Joe (who was a good judge) agreed, and Mr. Wopsle (who was a bad judge) agreed.The sergeant, a decisive man, ordered that the sound should not be answered, but that the course should be changed, and that his men should make towards it “at the double.”So we slanted to the right (where the East was), and Joe pounded away so wonderfully, that I had to hold on tight to keep my seat."
"眼下我们真的是在飞奔。乔一直只念叨着两个字来形容，“快跑”。我们跑上河岸又跑下河岸，通过闸门，趟过水渠，击起一片水花，越过杂乱的灯芯草丛，没有人在意脚下的路。随着我们离喊声越来越近，我们也越来越清楚地知道，那不只是一个人的声音。有时候，喊声全部消失了，然后士兵们也停下了。当喊声再次响起来时，士兵们就以更快的速度朝那边奔过去，我们紧跟在后面。一会儿过后，我们已经离喊声很近了，我们能听到一个声音喊道：“杀人啦！”另一个声音喊道：“罪犯在这儿！逃犯！警卫！罪犯往这边跑啦！”然后两个人的声音似乎在扭打之中戛然而止，一会儿过后又响了起来。此时，士兵和乔都像鹿一样飞奔过去。","It was a run indeed now, and what Joe called, in the only two words he spoke all the time, “a Winder.”Down banks and up banks, and over gates, and splashing into dykes, and breaking among coarse rushes: no man cared where he went.As we came nearer to the shouting, it became more and more apparent that it was made by more than one voice.Sometimes, it seemed to stop altogether, and then the soldiers stopped.When it broke out again, the soldiers made for it at a greater rate than ever, and we after them.After a while, we had so run it down, that we could hear one voice calling “Murder!” and another voice, “Convicts!Runaways!Guard!This way for the runaway convicts!”Then both voices would seem to be stifled in a struggle, and then would break out again.And when it had come to this, the soldiers ran like deer and Joe too."
"我们离喊声越来越近，中士跑在最前面，他身后紧跟着两名士兵。当我们都跑到的时候，他们已经举起枪，扣上扳机，准备射击了。","The sergeant ran in first, when we had run the noise quite down, and two of his men ran in close upon him.Their pieces were cocked and leveled when we all ran in."
"“他们两个都在这里！”中士一边在沟底费力前进，一边气喘吁吁地说道，“投降吧，你们两个！你们这两头野兽！过来受死吧！”","“Here are both men!”Panted the sergeant, struggling at the bottom of a ditch.“Surrender, you two! and confound you for two wild beasts!Come asunder!”"
"水花四溅，污泥乱飞，同时传来一通叫骂声，还有一片拳打脚踢的声音。更多士兵跳下沟渠给中士帮忙。接着他们相继拽出我接触过的那个逃犯以及另外一个逃犯。两个人身上都血迹斑斑，他们气喘吁吁，破口大骂，奋力挣扎，但我还是一眼就认出了他们。","Water was splashing, and mud was flying, and oaths were being sworn, and blows were being struck, when some more men went down into the ditch to help the sergeant, and dragged out, separately, my convict and the other one.Both were bleeding and panting and execrating and struggling; but of course I knew them both directly."
"“记住了！”我认识的逃犯一边说一边用他破旧的衣袖拭去脸上的血迹，抖掉手指上扯下的头发，“我抓住了他！是我把他交给你们的！记住这个！”","“Mind!” said my convict, wiping blood from his face with his ragged sleeves, and shaking torn hair from his fingers: “I took him!I give him up to you!Mind that!”"
"“这没什么值得一提的。”中士说道，“这帮不了你什么忙，伙计，你和他的处境一样。铐上手铐！”","“It’s not much to be particular about,” said the sergeant; “it’ll do you small good, my man, being in the same plight yourself.Handcuffs there!”"
"“我没指望这能帮上我什么忙。我也不想这能改善我目前的状况。”我认识的逃犯贪婪地笑着说道，“我抓住了他。他知道。这对我来说就足够了。”","“I don’t expect it to do me any good.I don’t want it to do me better than it does now,” said my convict, with a greedy laugh.“I took him.He knows it.That’s enough for me.”"
"另一个逃犯看上去满身乌青。除了他左脸上的旧瘀伤之外，似乎他全身上下都被打伤，满是青瘀。直到两人分别被铐起来，他还气喘吁吁说不出话来，而只能倚靠着一个士兵才不至于摔倒。","The other convict was livid to look at, and, in addition to the old bruised left side of his face, seemed to be bruised and torn all over.He could not so much as get his breath to speak, until they were both separately handcuffed, but leaned upon a soldier to keep himself from falling."
"“注意了，警卫，他想杀了我。”这是他说的第一句话。","“Take notice, guard—he tried to murder me,” were his first words."
"“想杀了他？”我认识的逃犯鄙视地说道，“想杀了他，却没有这么做？我抓住了他，把他交给你们，这就是我所做的。我不仅阻止了他逃出沼泽地，而且把他拽到这里来——从很远的地方一直拽到这里。","“Tried to murder him?” said my convict, disdainfully.“Try, and not do it?I took him, and give him up; that’s what I done.I not only prevented him getting off the marshes, but I dragged him here—dragged him this far on his way back."
"这个恶棍还伪装成绅士，真是岂有此理。现在，多亏了我，监狱船又得到了它的绅士。杀了他？杀他根本不值，我完全可以杀他，可还是把他拽了回来！”另一个逃犯仍气喘吁吁地说：“他想——他想——杀了我。你们可以——可以作证。”","He’s a gentleman, if you please, this villain.Now, the Hulks has got its gentleman again, through me.Murder him?Worth my while, too, to murder him, when I could do worse and drag him back!”The other one still gasped, “He tried—he tried—to—murder me.Bear—bear witness.”"
"“听着！”我认识的逃犯对中士说，“我单枪匹马地逃出了监狱船。我一路狂奔，最后成功逃脱。要不是我发现他在这里的话，我同样早就逃出这冻死人的沼泽地了，不信看看我的腿，你已经看不见铁镣了。让他逃走？让他从我想出的办法中得到好处？让他再利用我一次？　再利用一次？不，不，绝不。即使我死在沟底这里，”他朝沟渠用力挥动了一下他被铐住的双手，“我也要紧紧地抓住他，让你们从我手中平平安安地把他带走。”","“Looked here!” said my convict to the sergeant.“Single-handed I got clear of the prison-ship; I made a dash and I done it.I could ha’ got clear of these death-cold flats likewise—look at my leg: you won’t find much iron on it—if I hadn’t made the discovery that he was here.Let him go free?Let him profit by the means as I found out?Let him make a tool of me afresh and again?Once more?No, no, no.If I had died at the bottom there;” and he made an emphatic swing at the ditch with his manacled hands; “I’d have held to him with that grip, that you should have been safe to find him in my hold.”"
"另一个逃犯显然对他这个同伴极度恐惧，不断重复着：“他想杀了我。要是你们没来的话，我早就死了。”","The other fugitive, who was evidently in extreme horror of his companion, repeated, “He tried to murder me.I should have been a dead man if you had not come up.”"
"“他撒谎！”我认识的犯人恶狠狠地说道，“他生来就是个撒谎精，到死还是个撒谎精。看看他的脸，那不是明摆着的吗？让他用眼睛看着我。我不信他敢看着我。”","“He lies!” said my convict, with fierce energy.“He’s a liar born, and he’ll die a liar.Look at his face; aren’t it written there?Let him turn those eyes of his on me.I defy him to do it.”"
"另一个逃犯尽力想挤出一丝轻蔑的笑容，嘴巴却神经质地颤动而没能做出任何表情。他看了看士兵，望了望沼泽地和天空，但可以肯定的是，他没有看正在说话的那个人。","The other, with an effort at a scornful smile—which could not, however, collect the nervous working of his mouth into any set expression—looked at the soldiers, and looked about at the marshes and at the sky, but certainly did not look at the speaker."
"“你们看到他了吗？”我认识的逃犯寸步不让，“你们看到他有多混帐了吗？你们看到他那双低声下气，飘忽不定的眼睛了吗？我们一起受审的时候他就是这样。他从来不敢看我。”","“Do you see him?” pursued my convict.“Do you see what a villain he is?Do you see those groveling and wandering eyes?That’s how he looked when we were tried together.He never looked at me.”"
"另一个逃犯一直在颤动，颤动着他干裂的嘴唇。他的眼神在他周围或远或近地游移不定，最后终于在对方身上停留了片刻，他说道：“你没有什么可看的。”同时他用半嘲笑的眼神瞥了一眼对方被铐住的双手。这时，我认识的逃犯变得恼怒至极，要不是士兵的阻拦，他早就冲过去扑倒在他身上了。“我告诉过你们了，”另一个逃犯说，“要是可以的话，他会杀了我的。”任何人都看得出来，他因为害怕而浑身发抖，而且嘴唇上出现了奇怪的、薄雪片似的白色唾沫。","The other, always working and working his dry lips and turning his eyes restlessly about him far and near, did at last turn them for a moment on the speaker, with the words, “You are not much to look at,” and with a half-taunting glance at the bound hands.At that point, my convict became so frantically exasperated, that he would have rushed upon him but for the interposition of the soldiers.“Didn’t I tell you,” said the other convict then, “that he would murder me, if he could?”And any one could see that he shook with fear, and that there broke out upon his lips, curious white flakes, like thin snow."
"“够了，别再说了。”中士说道，“把火把点亮。”","“Enough of this parley,” said the sergeant.“Light those torches.”"
"一个没有扛枪而是提着篮子的士兵蹲下身来打开篮子。这时我认识的逃犯第一次看了看他四周，并且看到了我。我们紧跟着士兵们来到沟边之后，我就从乔的背上下来了，之后就没有动过。在他看着我的同时，我也急切地看着他，我轻轻地挥了挥手，摇了摇头。我一直在等他看到我，这样我就能够设法向他保证我是无辜的。但我一点也没有弄清楚他是否理解了我的意图，因为他向我做出了一个我根本不明白的表情，而且那个表情转瞬即逝。但是即使他看了我整整一个小时甚至是整整一天，我也只能记住那一瞬间他的表情，因为那一刻我最为留心。","As one of the soldiers, who carried a basket in lieu of a gun, went down on his knee to open it, my convict looked round him for the first time, and saw me.I had alighted from Joe’s back on the brink of the ditch when we came up, and had not moved since.I looked at him eagerly when he looked at me, and slightly moved my hands and shook my head.I had been waiting for him to see me that I might try to assure him of my innocence.It was not at all expressed to me that he even comprehended my intention, for he gave me a look that I did not understand, and it all passed in a moment.But if he had looked at me for an hour or for a day, I could not have remembered his face ever afterwards, as having been more attentive."
"那个提篮子的士兵很快就打着了火，点亮了三四个火把。他自己拿着一个，将剩下的分给其他人。之前天就几乎黑了，但现在似乎更黑了，不久就彻底黑了下来。在我们离开事发地之前，四个士兵围成一圈，向空中开了两枪。这时，我们看到在我们身后不远处以及河对面有其他火把也点亮了。“准备好了，”中士说道，“出发。”","The soldier with the basket soon got a light, and lighted three or four torches, and took one himself and distributed the others.It had been almost dark before, but now it seemed quite dark, and soon afterwards very dark.Before we departed from that spot, four soldiers standing in a ring, fired twice into the air.Presently we saw other torches kindled at some distance behind us, and others on the marshes on the opposite bank of the river.“All right,” said the sergeant.“March.”"
"我们没有走多远就听见前方传来三声炮响，巨大的响声似乎震破了我的耳膜。“他们正等着你们上船呢。”中士对我认识的逃犯说，“他们知道你们回来了。别掉队，伙计。跟上来。”","We had not gone far when three cannon were fired ahead of us with a sound that seemed to burst something inside my ear.“You are expected on board,” said the sergeant to my convict; “they know you are coming.Don’t straggle, my man.Close up here.”"
"两个逃犯被分开了，行进过程中，每人身边都包围着一圈警卫。此时，我抓着乔的一只手，乔的另一只手则举着一个火把。沃甫赛先生很早就想回去了，但乔决心要看个究竟，所以我们继续随队行进。眼下脚下的路已是相当好走了。我们大部分时间都是沿河前进，不时也要绕道而行，因为途中会遇上带小风车的堤坝以及满是污泥的闸门。我朝四下望了望，看见身后有其他火把跟上来了。一路上我们举着的火把掉落下大堆的灰烬，我还能看到地上那些灰烬冒着烟，闪着火光。此外便是一片漆黑，我什么也看不见。我们的火把用它们仅有的火光温暖了我们周围的空气。两个被火枪包围的逃犯一瘸一拐地走着，他们似乎很喜欢这种温暖。他们不仅走路一瘸一拐，而且还相当疲惫。有两三次我们不得不停下来让他们休息，所以我们根本走不快。","The two were kept apart, and each walked surrounded by a separate guard.I had hold of Joe’s hand now, and Joe carried one of the torches.Mr. Wopsle had been for going back, but Joe was resolved to see it out, so we went on with the party.There was a reasonably good path now, mostly on the edge of the river, with a divergence here and there where a dyke came, with a miniature windmill on it and a muddy sluice-gate.When I looked round, I could see the other lights coming in after us.The torches we carried, dropped great blotches of fire upon the track, and I could see those, too, lying smoking and flaring.I could see nothing else but black darkness.Our lights warmed the air about us with their pitchy blaze, and the two prisoners seemed rather to like that, as they limped along in the midst of the muskets.We could not go fast, because of their lameness; and they were so spent, that two or three times we had to halt while they rested."
"这样走了一个小时左右，我们来到一个简陋的小木屋，这里有一个渡口。木屋里有一队警卫，他们向我们发问，中士回答了他们。然后我们进了小木屋，屋里满是一股烟味和石灰水的味道。屋里有个烧得正旺的火堆、一盏灯、一个火枪架、一面鼓和一张低矮的木板通铺。这张床就像一台没安装零件的、硕大无朋的轧布机，可以同时容纳十来个士兵。床上躺着三四个穿着大衣的士兵，他们对我们不是很感兴趣，只是抬起头，睡眼惺忪地看了我们一眼，然后又躺下了。中士报告了一下，做了些书面记录，然后我不认识的那个逃犯就被警卫先押送上了船。","After an hour or so of this traveling, we came to a rough wooden hut and a landing-place.There was a guard in the hut, and they challenged, and the sergeant answered.Then, we went into the hut where there was a smell of tobacco and whitewash, and a bright fire, and a lamp, and a stand of muskets, and a drum, and a low wooden bedstead, like an overgrown mangle without the machinery, capable of holding about a dozen soldiers all at once.Three or four soldiers who lay upon it in their great-coats, were not much interested in us, but just lifted their heads and took a sleepy stare, and then lay down again.The sergeant made some kind of report, and some entry in a book, and then the convict whom I call the other convict was drafted off with his guard, to go on board first."
"我认识的那个逃犯自从看过我一眼后就再也没有看过我。我们站在小木屋里的时候，他站在火炉前，有时若有所思地看着火堆，有时把脚轮流搁在火炉搁架上，若有所思地看着双脚，仿佛在同情它们刚才参与的冒险。突然，他转向中士说道：","My convict never looked at me, except that once.While we stood in the hut, he stood before the fire looking thoughtfully at it, or putting up his feet by turns upon the hob, and looking thoughtfully at them as if he pitied them for their recent adventures.Suddenly, he turned to the sergeant, and remarked: "
"“关于这次逃跑我有话要说。以免有些人因为我而受到牵连。”","“I wish to say something respecting this escape.It may prevent some persons laying under suspicion a longer me.”"
"“有话尽管说。”中士双臂交叉地站在那里，冷冷地看着他回答道，“但你没有必要在这里说。你知道，在结案之前，你有足够的机会说，或者听别人说。”","“You can say what you like,” returned the sergeant, standing coolly looking at him with his arms folded, “but you have no call to say it here.You’ll have opportunity enough to say about it, and hear about it, before it’s done with, you know.”"
"“我知道，但这是另外一回事，与此无关的事。人是不能挨饿的，至少我不能。我拿了一些吃的，从那边的村子里拿的，就是沼泽地过去有教堂的那个村子。”","“I know, but this is another pint, a separate matter.A man can’t starve; at least I can’t.I took some witless, up at the willage over yonder—where the church stands a’most out on the marshes.”"
"“你是说偷的吧。”中士说道。","“You mean stole,” said the sergeant."
"“我告诉你是从哪家拿的。是从铁匠家拿的。”","“And I’ll tell you where from.From the blacksmith’s.”"
"“啊！”中士说道，同时盯着乔。","“Halloa!” said the sergeant, staring at Joe."
"“啊，皮普！”乔说道，同时盯着我。","“Halloa, Pip!” said Joe, staring at me."
"“是些剩菜剩饭——本来就是——一点酒还有一个馅饼。“","“It was some broken witless—that’s what it was—and a dram of liquor, and a pie.”"
"“铁匠，你们有没有丢馅饼这类的东西？”中士私下问道。","“Have you happened to miss such an article as a pie, blacksmith?” asked the sergeant, confidentially. "
"“我妻子发现馅饼丢了，就在你来我们家的时候。你知道这事吗，皮普？”","“My wife did, at the very moment when you came in.Don’t you know, Pip?”"
"“那么，”我认识的逃犯闷闷不乐地看着乔却一眼也没有看我，“那么你就是那个铁匠了，是吗？　很抱歉我吃了你的馅饼。”","“So,” said my convict, turning his eyes on Joe in a moody manner, and without the least glance at me; “so you’re the blacksmith, are you?Then I’m sorry to say, I’ve eat your pie.”"
"“上帝知道只要馅饼是我的，你可以随便吃。”乔回答说，此时他又想起了乔太太，“我们不知道你都干了什么，但我们不会因此而饿死你的，可怜的同胞。是不是，皮普？”","“God knows you’re welcome to it—so far as it was ever mine,” returned Joe, with a saving remembrance of Mrs. Joe.“We don’t know what you have done, but we wouldn’t have you starved to death for it, poor miserable fellow-creator.—Would us, Pip?”"
"我之前注意到的声音又在那个人的喉咙里咔嗒响了一声，他转过身去了。小船回来了，他的警卫准备就绪，于是我们跟随他来到由粗木桩和石头搭建的渡口，看着他被押到船上。划船的是跟他一样的一组罪犯。见到他，似乎没有人感到惊奇，感到有趣，感到高兴或是感到遗憾，也没有人说话，除了船上一个人像使唤狗一样咆哮道：“你们出发！”这是开桨启程的信号。借着火把的火光，我们看到黑色的监狱船停在离河岸污泥的不远处，就像一艘邪恶的诺亚方舟。船身被大量锈迹斑斑的铁链捆绑着、束缚着。在我幼小的眼睛里，这艘关押罪犯的船就像罪犯一样被铁镣铐着。我们看着渡船驶到监狱船旁边，看着他被押上大船，然后消失了。然后，烧剩下的火把被扔进了水里，咝咝响过之后就熄灭了，仿佛一切都随他而去了。","The something that I had noticed before, clicked in the man’s throat again, and he turned his back.The boat had returned, and his guard was ready, so we followed him to the landing-place made of rough stakes and stones, and saw him put into the boat, which was rowed by a crew of convicts like himself.No one seemed surprised to see him, or interested in seeing him, or glad to see him, or sorry to see him, or spoke a word, except that somebody in the boat growled as if to dogs, “Give way, you!” which was the signal for the dip of the oars.By the light of the torches, we saw the black Hulk lying out a little way from the mud of the shore, like a wicked Noah’s ark.Cribbed and barred and moored by massive rusty chains, the prison-ship seemed in my young eyes to be ironed like the prisoners.We saw the boat go alongside, and we saw him taken up the side and disappear.Then, the ends of the torches were flung hissing into the water, and went out, as if it were all over with him."
"第六章","Chapter 6"
"我出乎意料地从偷盗给我带来的精神负担中解脱出来。但这种精神负担并没有促使我坦白交代，毕竟，归根结底我的本意是好的。","My state of mind regarding the pilfering, from which I had been so unexpectedly exonerated, did not impel me to frank disclosure; but hope it had some dregs of good at the bottom of it."
"当担心被发现的恐惧消失之后，我也记不得我对乔太太在良心上有任何歉意。但我喜欢乔——也许仅仅因为那时年龄小，觉得这个亲爱的伙计允许我喜欢他，除此之外没有更好的理由了——因此，一想到他，我的内心就很难平静下来。我一直在想（尤其是当我第一次看到他到处找他的锉刀时），我应该告诉乔全部的实情。但是我没有这样做，因为我担心如果我这样做了，他就会把我看得比实际上更坏。我害怕失去乔的信任，害怕从此以后只能每晚坐在火炉旁失落地看着我永远失去的同伴和朋友。这种恐惧堵住了我的嘴。我病态地告诉自已，一旦乔知道了真相，从此以后，我每次看到他坐在火炉边摸着连鬓胡子时，他肯定是在想这件事。一旦乔知道了真相，从此以后，每当前一天的肉或布丁出现在当天的餐桌上时，不管乔多么随意地看它们一眼，他都会在思索我是不是进过食品间。一旦乔知道了真相，那么在我们今后的共同生活当中，每一次他评论所喝的啤酒是浓是淡时，都肯定是在怀疑酒里是不是加了柏油水，这会把我羞得满脸通红的。总之，尽管我知道什么是对的，但我却没有胆量去做，就像尽管我知道什么是错的，但我却没有胆量拒绝不做一样。那时候我与外部的世界并没有往来。很多人都是以这种方式处世的，但我没有模仿任何人。我完全是自学成才，独自一人发掘出我的行为准则。","I do not recall that I felt any tenderness of conscience in reference to Mrs. Joe, when the fear of being found out was lifted off me.But I loved Joe—perhaps for no better reason in those early days than because the dear fellow let me love him—and, as to him, my inner self was not so easily composed.It was much upon my mind (particularly when I first saw him looking about for his file) that I ought to tell Joe the whole truth.Yet I did not, and for the reason that I mistrusted that if I did, he would think me worse than I was.The fear of losing Joe’s confidence, and of thenceforth sitting in the chimney-corner at night staring drearily at my for ever lost companion and friend, tied up my tongue.I morbidly represented to myself that if Joe knew it, I never afterwards could see him at the fireside feeling his fair whisker, without thinking that he was meditating on it.That, if Joe knew it, I never afterwards could see him glance, however casually, at yesterday’s meat or pudding when it came on today’s table, without thinking that he was debating whether I had been in the pantry. That, if Joe knew it, and at any subsequent period of our joint domestic life remarked that his beer was flat or thick, the conviction that he suspected Tar in it, would bring a rush of blood to my face.In a word, I was too cowardly to do what I knew to be right, as I had been too cowardly to avoid doing what I knew to be wrong.I had had no intercourse with the world at that time, and imitated none of its many inhabitants who act in this manner.Quite an untaught genius, I made the discovery of the line of action for myself."
"离开监狱船之后没走多远，我就感到困倦了。于是乔又把我背了起来，一直把我背回家。沃甫赛先生一路上肯定也非常疲惫。虽然他很困却又不能睡觉，这让他火气非常大。如果教堂已经实行了公开竞选，他可能会把追捕队伍中的所有人都开除教籍，首先就是我和乔。然而仅仅凭借他平信徒的能力，即使火气大到发疯的地步，他也只是坚持坐在潮湿的沼泽地上而已。如果他犯了死罪的话，当他脱下外套拿到厨房的炉火上去烘干时，他裤子上留下的间接证据足以把他送上绞刑架。","As I was sleepy before we were far away from the prison-ship, Joe took me on his back again and carried me home.He must have had a tiresome journey of it, for Mr. Wopsle, being knocked up, was in such a very bad temper that if the Church had been thrown open, he would probably have excommunicated the whole expedition, beginning with Joe and myself.In his lay capacity, he persisted in sitting down in the damp to such an insane extent, that when his coat was taken off to be dried at the kitchen fire, the circumstantial evidence on his trousers would have hanged him if it had been a capital offence."
"那时候，由于我之前在乔的背上睡得很熟，一被放下来，就在厨房里热气和嘈杂声中走着，像个小酒鬼一样跌跌撞撞地走着。当我清醒过来时（多亏了我姐姐在我两个肩膀之间重重地打了一拳并且震耳欲聋地喊了一句：“哎呀！哪里还有像这样的孩子！”）我发现乔正给他们讲那个逃犯的招供。所有的客人都在猜测他是通过怎样的方式进入食品间的，大家看法不一。在仔细考察了房屋及周围的场地之后，彭波契克先生认为，他先是爬上铁匠铺的屋顶，然后爬上房顶，借着用床单布条结成的绳索爬下厨房的烟囱。由于彭波契克先生非常肯定而且拥有一辆轻便马车——比所有人都高一等——所以大家都同意一定是这样的。然而，沃甫赛先生却拼命喊道：“不是这样的！”他很疲惫，声音微弱却充满怨恨。但由于他缺乏理论，而且又没穿大衣，大家都没拿他当回事——更不用说他此时正背对着厨房炉火，站着烘干身上的湿气，背后还冒出蒸发出来的热气。这自然无法赢得人们对他的信任。","By that time, I was staggering on the kitchen floor like a little drunkard, through having been newly set upon my feet, and through having been fast asleep, and through waking in the heat and light sand noise of tongues.As I came to myself (with the aid of a heavy thump between the shoulders, and the restorative exclamation “Yah! Was there ever such a boy as this!” from my sister), I found Joe telling them about the convict’s confession, and all the visitors suggesting different ways by which he had got into the pantry.Mr. Pumblechook made out, after carefully surveying the premises, that he had first got upon the roof of the forge, and had then got upon the roof of the house, and had then let himself down the kitchen chimney by a rope made of his bedding cut into strips; and as Mr. Pumblechook was very positive and drove his own chaise-cart—over everybody—it was agreed that it must be so.Mr. Wopsle, indeed, wildly cried out “No!” with the feeble malice of a tired man; but, as he had no theory, and no coat on, he was unanimously set at ought—not to mention his smoking hard behind, as he stood with his back to the kitchen fire to draw the damp out: which was not calculated to inspire confidence."
"这就是那天晚上我所听到的一切。之后我姐姐觉得我在那里迷迷糊糊的，碍客人的眼，就抓起我，用力地拖我上楼睡觉。而我就像脚上穿了五十双靴子一样迈不开步，上楼的时候两脚一直在楼梯边上悬摆着。正如我所描述的那样，我的精神负担在我早上起床之前就出现了，一直持续到这件事被遗忘之后的很长一段时间。最终除了个别场合之外，也不再被记起了。","This was all I heard that night before my sister clutched me, as a slumberous offence to the company’s eyesight, and assisted me up toed with such a strong hand that I seemed to have fifty boots on, and to be dangling them all against the edges of the stairs.My state of mind, as I have described it, began before I was up in the morning, and lasted long after the subject had died out, and had ceased to be mentioned saving on exceptional occasions."
"第七章","Chapter 7"
"当我站在墓地里读家人墓碑上的字时，我才刚刚学会如何拼写那些字。我甚至对于它们最简单意思的理解也不是非常正确。比如当我读到“上述者之妻”时，我以为那是对我父亲上升到一个更好世界的赞美之词。而且如果我已故亲人当中有任何一个人被指为“之下”的话，我一定会对这位家庭成员产生最坏的看法。通过《教理问答》我形成了这两个方位在神学上的概念，而我对这两个方位的都是一点也不准确的。因为我清楚地记得，当我宣读“一生之中，坚守常道”时，我以为自己有义务在出门之后，总是按照一个特定的方向穿过村子，从不改变，既不会拐到车匠铺那边，也不会拐到磨坊这边。","At the time when I stood in the churchyard, reading the family tombstones, I had just enough learning to be able to spell them out.My construction even of their simple meaning was not very correct, for I read “wife of the Above” as a complimentary reference to my father’s exaltation to a better world; and if anyone of my deceased relations had been referred to as “Below,” I have no doubt I should have formed the worst opinions of that member of the family.Neither, were my notions of the theological positions to which my Catechism bound me, at all accurate; for, I have a lively remembrance that I supposed my declaration that I was to “walk in the same all the days of my life,” laid me under an obligation always to go through the village from our house in one particular direction, and never to vary it by turning down by the wheelwright’s or up by the mill."
"当我年龄够大之后，我就会给乔当学徒。在我得到那份尊严之前，我不能成为乔太太所称的“大派头”的孩子，我对这个词的理解就是饮食过量的孩子。因此，我不仅仅是铁匠铺里干杂活的小子，要是哪个邻居正好要另外找个孩子去赶鸟、捡石子或者干其他类似的活，他们都喜欢差我去做。然而，为了不损害我们高贵的地位，厨房的壁炉架上就摆放了一个钱盒子，好让大家都知道，我赚的钱都放在这个盒子里了。我觉得这些钱最终会为国家债务的清算做出贡献，因为我知道我是没有希望分得这份财富的。","When I was old enough, I was to be apprenticed to Joe, and until I could assume that dignity I was not to be what Mrs. Joe called “Pomp eyed,” or (as I render it) pampered.Therefore, I was not only odd-boy about the forge, but if any neighbor happened to want an extra boy to frighten birds, or pick up stones, or do any such job, I was favored with the employment.In order, however, that our superior position might not be compromised thereby, a money-box was kept on the kitchen mantel-shelf, in to which it was publicly made known that all my earnings were dropped.I have an impression that they were to be contributed eventually towards the liquidation of the National Debt, but I know I had no hope of any personal participation in the treasure."
"沃甫赛先生的姑婆是个荒唐的老太婆。这个姑婆在村子里开办了一所夜校。她钱财有限却病痛无数，每天晚上会从六点开始睡到七点。也就是说，一群年轻人每人每周付两便士就是为了有机会亲眼看她在那个时候睡觉。她租了一个小村舍。村舍楼上的房间是属于沃甫赛先生的。我们这些学生在那里经常可以听见他用极庄重、极大声的方式大声朗读，偶尔还有撞击楼板的声音。有传言说沃甫赛先生会“检查”学生，每季度一次。每逢这时，他就会挽起衣袖，竖起头发，给我们朗诵马克·安东尼(注：莎士比亚剧本《裘里斯·凯撒》中的角色)在凯撒大帝遗体旁的演说。接着他还总是会朗诵柯林斯的《激情颂》。其中我尤其敬佩沃甫赛先生对复仇之神的演绎。他将手中沾满鲜血的利剑一挥，立即划出一道霹雳，面容枯槁地吹响宣战的号角。在我之后的生活当中，随着我跌进感情世界并将这些情感与柯林斯及沃甫赛先生作对比，我才发现这两个人其实并没有那么出色，但在当时我是体会不到这些的。","Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt kept an evening school in the village; that is to say, she was a ridiculous old woman of limited means and unlimited infirmity, who used to go to sleep from six to seven every evening, in the society of youth who paid two pence per week each, for the improving opportunity of seeing her do it.She rented a small cottage, and Mr. Wopsle had the room up-stairs, where we students used to overhear him reading aloud in a most dignified and terrific manner, and occasionally bumping on the ceiling.There was a fiction that Mr. Wopsle “examined” the scholars, once a quarter. What he did on those occasions was to turn up his cuffs, stick up his hair, and give us Mark Antony’s oration over the body of Caesar.This was always followed by Collins’s @Ode on the Passions@, wherein I particularly venerated Mr. Wopsle as Revenge, throwing his blood-stained sword in thunder down, and taking the War-denouncing trumpet with a withering look.It was not with me then, as it was in later life, when I fell into the society of the Passions, and compared them with Collins and Wopsle, rather to the disadvantage of both gentlemen."
"除了经营这个教育机构之外，沃甫赛先生的姑婆还在同一间屋子里开了一家小杂货店。她不知道她有哪些存货，也不知道任何一种货物的价格。但是抽屉里有一本油乎乎的小备忘簿，用来作为价格目录。正是靠着这部宝典，比迪安排了商店的所有交易。比迪是沃甫赛先生姑婆的孙女。坦白地讲，我自己也搞不清楚她跟沃甫赛先生是什么关系。她和我一样是个孤儿，而且和我一样，是被别人“一手”养大的。我觉得由于她粗大的四肢，她总是非常引人注目。因为她的头发总是乱的，需要梳理；她的手总是脏的，需要清洗；她总是趿拉着鞋。但这种描述只适用于工作日内。星期天的时候，她会精心打扮一番，然后去教堂。","Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt, besides keeping this Educational Institution, kept—in the same room—a little general shop.She had no idea what stock she had, or what the price of anything in it was; but there was a little greasy memorandum-book kept in a drawer, which served as a Catalogue of Prices, and by this oracle Biddy arranged all the shop transaction.Biddy was Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt’s granddaughter; I confess myself quiet unequal to the working out of the problem, what relation she was to Mr. Wopsle.She was an orphan like myself; like me, too, had been brought up by hand.She was most noticeable, I thought, in respect of her extremities; for, her hair always wanted brushing, her hands always wanted washing, and her shoes always wanted mending and pulling up at heel.This description must be received with a week-day limitation.On Sundays, she went to church elaborated."
"主要依靠我自身的努力，加上比迪的帮助，我总算费力地学会了字母表。而沃甫赛先生的姑婆对我的帮助还不及比迪。学习字母表时我就像行走在黑莓灌木丛当中，每一个字母都让我非常苦恼、伤痕累累。之后，我又跌进九个数字这个贼窝里。它们似乎每晚都搞出一点新把戏来伪装自己，让我分辨不出来。但是，犹如在黑暗中摸索，最终我开始进行最基础的读、写和计算。","Much of my unassisted self, and more by the help of Biddy than of Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt, I struggled through the alphabet as if it had been a bramble-bush; getting considerably worried and scratched by every letter.After that, I fell among those thieves, the nine figures, who seemed every evening to do something new to disguise them and baffle recognition.But, at last I began, in a purblind groping way, to read, write, and cipher, on the very smallest scale."
"一天晚上，我坐在壁炉旁，手里拿着石板，绞尽脑汁地想要给乔写封信。我寻思着，此时离我们到沼泽地追捕逃犯那天肯定已经整整有一年的时间了，因为眼下又到了冬天，到了严霜季节。我把字母表放在脚边的壁炉前做参考，然后花了一两个小时又写又涂，最后终于完成了这封信。","One night, I was sitting in the chimney-corner with my slate, expending great efforts on the production of a letter to Joe.I think it must have been a fully year after our hunt upon the marshes, for it was a long time after, and it was winter and a hard frost.With an alphabet on the hearth at my feet for reference, I contrived in an hour or two to print and smear this epistle:"
"“我青爱的乔，我息望你生体见康，我息望不酒能交你写，乔，那会有多高心啊，等我当了你的土弟，我会有多高心啊，乔，请相辛我。皮普。”","“MI DEER JO I OPE U R KR WITE WELL I OPE I SHAL SON B HABELL 4 2TEEDGE U JO AN THEN WE SHORL B SO GLODD A WEN I M PRENGTD 2 U JOWOT LARX A BLEVE ME INF XN PIP.”"
"我根本就没有必要通过写信来和乔交流，因为他就坐在我旁边，而且只有我们两个人。但我还是把这封写在石板上的交流信双手交给了乔，乔就像接受一个学术奇迹一样接过了它。","There was no indispensable necessity for my communicating with Joe by letter, inasmuch as he sat beside me and we were alone.But, I delivered this written communication (slate and all) with my own hand, and Joe received it as a miracle of erudition."
"“我说，皮普，老弟！”乔把他那蓝色的眼睛睁得大大地喊道，“你真成了个大学问家了！是不是？”","“I say, Pip, old chap!” cried Joe, opening his blue eyes wide, “what a scholar you are!Can’t you?”"
"“我也想当个大学问家。”我说道，同时看了一眼乔手中拿着的石板，担心我写的字太不整齐了。","“I should like to be,” said I, glancing at the slate as he held it: with a misgiving that the writing was rather hilly."
"“这是个J，”乔说道，“这是个O，写得真好！一个J和一个O，皮普，就是J-O，即乔。”","“Why, here’s a J,” said Joe, “and a O equal to any think!Here’s a J and an O, Pip, and a J-O, Joe.”"
"除了这个单音节词之外，我从没有听到乔更大声地朗读过。上个星期日在教堂的时候，我不小心把祈祷书拿倒了，但我发现那丝毫没有给乔带来任何麻烦，仿佛那本来就是对的。我想利用这个机会弄清楚，我是否要从最基础开始教乔读写，所以我说道：“哦！把剩下的都读完，乔。”","I had never heard Joe read aloud to any greater extent than this monosyllable, and I had observed at church last Sunday when I accidentally held our Prayer-Book upside down, that it seemed to suit his convenience quite as well as if it had been all right. Wishing to embrace the present occasion of finding out whether in teaching Joe, I should have to begin quite at the beginning, I said, “Ah!But read the rest, Jo.”"
"“剩下的，嗯，皮普？”乔用慢慢搜寻的目光看着它说道，“一，二，三。喏，这里有三个J，三个O，三个J-O，三个乔，皮普！”","“The rest, eh, Pip?” said Joe, looking at it with a slowly searching eye, “One, two, three.Why, here’s three Js, and three Os, and three J-O, Joes in it, Pip!”"
"我斜靠在乔身上，用食指指着，把整封信念给他听。","I leaned over Joe, and, with the aid of my forefinger, read him the whole letter."
"“太了不起了！”我读完之后，乔说道，“你真是个大学问家。”","“Astonishing!” said Joe, when I had finished.“You are a scholar.”"
"“你是怎么拼写‘格雷戈里’的，乔？”我带着些许施恩的口气问道。","“How do you spell Gregory, Joe?”I asked him, with a modest patronage."
"“我根本就不会拼。”乔说道。","“I don’t spell it at all,” said Joe."
"“但是假设你会呢？”","“But supposing you did?”"
"“这可不能假设。”乔说，“尽管我也跟其他人一样喜欢读书。”","“It can’t be supposed,” said Joe.“Though I’m on common fond of reading, too.”"
"“你喜欢读书，乔？”","“Are you, Joe?”"
"“一般来讲，是的。”乔说道，“能让我捧着一本好书，或拿着一张好报，坐在烧得正旺的炉火前，我就别无所求了。天啊！”他挠了几下膝盖接着说道，“当你看到一个J和一个O，你就会说‘看，J和O连起来就是乔’，读书多有意思啊！”","“On-common.Give me,” said Joe, “a good book, or a good newspaper, and sit me down afore a good fire, and I ask no better.Lord!” he continued, after rubbing his knees a little, “when you do come to a J and a O, and says you, “Here, at last, is a J-O, Joe,” how interesting reading is!”"
"从乔的话当中，我得出的结论是，乔受到的教育跟蒸汽动力一样还处在初级阶段。","I derived from this last, that Joe’s education, like Steam, was yet in its infancy. "
"顺着这个话题，我问道：“乔，你像我这么大的时候没有上过学吗？”","Pursuing the subject, I inquired:“Didn’t you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as me?”"
"“没有，皮普。”","“No, Pip.”"
"“你像我这么大的时候为什么不去上学呢，乔？”","“Why didn’t you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as me?”"
"“这个嘛，皮普，”乔拿起拨火棍，像他平常沉思时一样慢慢地拨弄着靠下边的炉条之间的火，“我告诉你吧。我父亲，皮普，他经常喝酒。一旦喝醉了，他就把拳头挥向我最仁慈的母亲。除了捶打我之外，他就只捶打我母亲一个人了。他用我们打铁时的力气捶打我，而他从不把这力气用在他的铁砧上——你在听我讲吗，听明白了吗，皮普？”","“Well, Pip,” said Joe, taking up the poker, and settling himself to his usual occupation when he was thoughtful, of slowly raking the fire between the lower bars: “I’ll tell you.My father, Pip, he were given to drink, and when he were overtook with drink, he hammered away at my mother, most on merciful.It were a’ most the only hammering he did, indeed, ’xcepting at myself.And he hammered at me with a wigor only to be equaled by the wigor with which he didn’t hammer at his anvil.—You’re a-listening and understanding, Pip?”"
"“是的，乔。”","“Yes, Joe.”"
"“结果，我和我母亲有几次从我父亲身边逃走了，然后我母亲就得出去工作。‘乔，’她总是说，‘现在，上帝保佑，你应该去上学，孩子。’然后她就把我送去上学。可是我父亲又那么好心，没有我们就受不了。于是，他就找来一大群人，聚集在我们借住的房子门前。这样房主只得必须和我们划清界线，把我们交给了父亲。然后父亲把我们带回家，把我们捶打了一顿。这样的话，你知道，皮普，”此时正若有所思地拨弄炉火的乔停了下来说道，“就成了我学习上的不利条件。”","“Consequence, my mother and me we ran away from my father, several times; and then my mother she’d go out to work, and she’d say, ‘Joe,’ she’d say, ‘now, please God, you shall have some schooling, child,’ and she’d put me to school.But my father was that good in his hart that he couldn’t a bear to be without us.So, he’d come with a most tremendous crowd and make such a row at the doors of the houses where we was, that they used to be obligated to have no more to do with us and to give us up to him.And then he took us home and hammered us.Which, you see, Pip,” said Joe, pausing in his meditative raking of the fire, and looking at me, “were a drawback on my learning.”"
"“那是肯定的，可怜的乔！”","“Certainly, poor Joe!”"
"“但是我要提醒你，皮普，”乔用拨火棍拨弄了两下上层的炉条，带着审判的口气说道，“评价人要看他们的所有言行，并且要一视同仁。这样的话，我父亲内心也有好的一面，你觉得呢？”","“Though mind you, Pip,” said Joe, with a judicial touch or two of the poker on the top bar, “rendering unto all their do, and maintaining equal justice betwixt man and man, my father were that good in his hart, don’t you see?”"
"我不这么觉得，但我没有说出口。","I didn’t see; but I didn’t say so."
"“哎！”乔继续说道，“必须要有人给锅烧火，皮普，否则食物是煮不熟的，你知道吗？”","“Well!”Joe pursued, “somebody must keep the pot a billing, Pip, or the pot won’t bile, don’t you know?”"
"我明白这个道理，也这样告诉了他。","I saw that, and said so."
"“后来，我父亲不反对我出去干活。于是我就开始干我现在这个营生。这也是他之前干的营生，不过他没坚持做下去。我干得还是很努力的，我保证，皮普。在那之后不久，我就能够养活他了，一直养活到他中风去世。而且我打算在他墓碑上这样写：不管他身上有什么缺点，请记住他内心善良的一面。”","“Consequence, my father didn’t make objections to my going to work; so I went to work to work at my present calling, which were his too, if he would have followed it, and I worked tolerable hard, I assure you, Pip.In time I was able to keep him, and I kept him till he went off in a purple leptic fit.And it were my intentions to have had put upon his tombstone that Whatsoever the failings on his part, Remember reader he were that good in his hart.”"
"乔带着满脸自豪的神情，仔细清晰地背诵这两句诗，所以我问他这是不是他自己写的。","Joe recited this couplet with such manifest pride and careful perspicuity, that I asked him if he had made it himself."
"“我写的，”乔说道，“我自己写的。我一下子就写出来了。就像一锤子挥下去，一块马蹄铁就完全打好了一样。我一辈子都没有这样惊讶过——不相信是我自己写的——实话告诉你，我几乎不相信这是我自己写的。就像我说的那样，皮普，我本来打算把它刻在他的墓碑上。但不管你想怎么刻，刻大字还是刻小字，都是要花钱的，所以最后没有刻成。更不用说还要付钱给抬棺木的人，所有能省下来的钱都要留给我母亲。她身体很差而且受了很大的打击。她没能坚持多久，可怜的人，最终也平静地去世了。”","“I made it,” said Joe, “my own self.I made it in a moment.It was like striking out a horseshoe complete, in a single blow.I never was so much surprised in all my life—couldn’t credit my own ed—to tell you the truth, hardly believed it were my own ed.As I was saying, Pip, it were my intentions to have had it cut over him; but poetry costs money, cut it how you will, small or large, and it were not done.Not to mention bearers, all the money that could be spared was wanted for my mother.She was in poor elth, and quite broke.She weren’t long of following, poor soul, and her share of peace comes round at last.”"
"乔的蓝眼睛有点湿润了，他用拨火棍顶部的圆把手揉了揉一只眼，又揉了揉另一只眼，这种方式让人觉得很不愉快，很不舒服。","Joe’s blue eyes turned a little watery; he rubbed, first one of them, and then the other, in a most uncongenial and uncomfortable manner, with the round knob on the top of the poker."
"乔说：“那时候我一个人住在这里很孤独，然后我就认识了你姐姐。嘿，皮普，”乔坚定地看着我说，仿佛他知道我一定会不同意他的说法，“你姐姐是个漂亮的女人。”","“It were but lonesome then,” said Joe, “living here alone, and I got acquainted with your sister.Now, Pip;” Joe looked firmly at me, as if he knew I was not going to agree with him; “your sister is a fine figure of a woman.”"
"我情不自禁地盯着炉火，露出明显怀疑的表情。","I could not help looking at the fire, in an obvious state of doubt."
"“在这个问题上，不管家人怎么看，不管世人怎么看，皮普，你姐姐就是，”乔用拨火棍敲打着上层的炉条，一字一顿地说道，“一个——漂亮——的——女人！”","“Whatever family opinions, or whatever the world’s opinions, on that subject may be, Pip, your sister is,” Joe tapped the top bar with the poker after every word following, “a—fine—figure—of—a—woman!”"
"我只能说：“乔，你能这么想我很高兴。”除此之外，我想不出其他更好的话来。","I could think of nothing better to say than “I am glad you think so, Joe.”"
"“我也是。”乔接着我的话回答道，“我能这么想我也很高兴，皮普。这里红一点，那里骨架突出一点，这对我来说有什么意义呢？”","“So am I,” returned Joe, catching me up.“I am glad I think so, Pip.A little redness or a little matter of Bone, here or there, what does it signify to Me?”"
"我机灵地说道，要是这对他来说没有意义，那么对谁有意义呢？","I sagaciously observed, if it didn’t signify to him, to whom did it signify?"
"“确实！”乔表示赞同，“的确是。你说得对，老弟！当我认识你姐姐的时候，人们都在谈论她是如何一手把你带大的。所有人都觉得她很善良，和大家一样，我也这么认为。至于你，”乔接着说道，脸上露出一副看到什么极其肮脏的东西的表情，“你要是看到自己那时候有多瘦小、体弱，长得有多难看的话，天啊，你也一定会非常鄙视自己的！”","“Certainly!” assented Joe.“That’s it.You’re right, old chap!When I got acquainted with your sister, it was the talk how she was bringing you up by hand.Very kind of her too, all the folks said, and I said, along with all the folks.As to you,” Joe pursued with a countenance expressive of seeing something very nasty indeed: “if you could have been aware how small and flabby and mean you was, dear me, you’d have formed the most contemptible opinion of yourself!”"
"我不太喜欢听这些话，于是我说：“乔，你不用惦记着我。”","Not exactly relishing this, I said, “Never mind me, Joe.”"
"“但我总是惦记着你，皮普，”乔温柔、淳朴地答道，“我向你姐姐提出要和她结为伴侣并到教堂举行仪式，她也愿意而且准备好搬到铁匠铺里来。那时我对她说：‘把那个可怜的小孩带来吧。上帝保佑那个可怜的小孩。铁匠铺里有他住的地方！’”","“But I did mind you, Pip,” he returned with tender simplicity. “When I offered to your sister to keep company, and to be asked in church at such times as she was willing and ready to come to the forge, I said to her, ‘And bring the poor little child.God bless the poor little child,’ I said to your sister, ‘there’s room for him at the forge!’”"
"听到这些，我不禁大哭起来。我一边请求他原谅我，一边双手抱住他的脖子。乔也放下了拨火棍抱住了我，他说：“我们永远都是最好的朋友，是不是，皮普？别哭了，老弟！”","I broke out crying and begging pardon, and hugged Joe round the neck: who dropped the poker to hug me, and to say, “Ever the best of friends; can’t us, Pip?Don’t cry, old chap!”"
"当这段小插曲结束之后，乔又接着说道：","When this little interruption was over, Joe resumed:"
"“噢，你看，皮普，我们俩就这样走到了一起！那就是值得我们庆幸的地方，我们俩走到了一起！现在，你要手把手地教我读书了，而且我得提前告诉你，我很笨的，非常笨。你教我读书这件事一定不能让乔太太知道。所以我说，我们必须暗地里干。为什么要暗地里干呢？我来告诉你为什么，皮普。”","“Well, you see, Pip, and here we are!That’s about where it lights; here we are!Now, when you take me in hand in my learning, Pip (and I tell you beforehand I am awful dull, most awful dull), Mrs. Joe mustn’t see too much of what we’re up to.It must be done, as I may say, on the sly.And why on the sly?I’ll tell you why, Pip.”"
"他又拿起了拨火棍，我怀疑要是没有这根拨火棍，他还能不能继续说下去。","He had taken up the poker again; without which, I doubt if he could have proceeded in his demonstration."
"“你姐姐喜欢官。”","“Your sister is given to government.”"
"“喜欢官，乔？”我吃了一惊，因为我隐约中产生了一种想法（而且不得不说的是，我其实希望这种想法实现），那就是乔已经因为她喜欢上了海军大臣或财政大臣而跟她离了婚。","“Given to government, Joe?”I was startled, for I had some shadowy idea (and I am afraid I must add, hope) that Joe had divorced her in a favor of the Lords of the Admiralty, or Treasury."
"“喜欢官。”乔说道，“我的意思是她喜欢管你和我。”","“Given to government,” said Joe.“Which I meander say the government of you and myself.”"
"“哦！”","“Oh!”"
"“而且她不喜欢家里有个学问家。”乔继续说道，“尤其是不喜欢我成为一个学问家，因为她害怕我会反抗。就像那种造反的人，你明白吗？”","“And she can’t over partial to having scholars on the premises,” Joe continued, “and in par tickler would not be over partial to my being a scholar, for fear as I might rise.Like a sort or rebel, don’t you see?”"
"我本来打算用一个问题来反驳他，可我刚说出个“为什么——”乔就打断了我。","I was going to retort with an inquiry, and had got as far as “Why—” when Joe stopped me."
"“等一下。我知道你要说什么，皮普，等一下！我不否认你姐姐总是骑在我们头上。我不否认她不仅把我们打倒在地，而且还会狠狠地再踹我们几脚。当你姐姐大发雷霆的时候，皮普，”乔压低声音小声说道，同时瞟了一眼门口，“我都不得不承认她是一个怪物。”","“Stay a bit.I know what you’re a-going to say, Pip; stay a bit!I don’t deny that your sister comes the Mogull over us, now and again.I don’t deny that she do throw us back-falls, and that she do drop down upon us heavy.At such times as when your sister is on the Ram-page, Pip,” Joe sank his voice to a whisper and glanced at the door, “can dour compel fur to admit that she is a Buster.”"
"乔念着这个词，仿佛它的开头至少有十二个重重的“怪”字。","Joe pronounced this word, as if it began with at least twelve capitals Bs."
"“我为什么不反抗呢？我打断你说话时你就正想问这个吧，皮普？”","“Why don’t I rise?That was your observation when I broke it off, Pip?”"
"“是的，乔。”","“Yes, Joe.”"
"“哎，”乔说着将拨火棍换到了左手，这样他就能用右手捋他的连鬓胡子了，每次他一摆出这种温顺的姿态，我就对他不抱希望了。“你姐姐是个决策者。一个决策者。”","“Well,” said Joe, passing the poker into his left hand, that he might feel his whisker; and I had no hope of him whenever he took to that placid occupation; “your sister’s a master-mind.A master-mind.”"
"“什么叫决策者？”我问道，希望借此为难他一下。但是出乎我的意料，乔在这个词的定义上做了更充分的准备。他直勾勾地看着我回答说：“决策者就是她。”他的循环论证让我完全无话可说。","“What’s that?”I asked, in some hope of bringing him to a stand. But, Joe was readier with his definition than I had expected, and completely stopped me by arguing circularly, and answering with affixed looks, “Her.”"
"“我不能成为决策者。”乔接着说道。他将目光从我身上移走，又开始捋他的连鬓胡子。“最后，皮普——我很认真地跟你说，老弟——我在我可怜的母亲身上看得太多了。她受苦受累，当牛做马，一颗诚实的心不断地被蹂躏，一辈子没有得到过一丝的平静。所以我最怕做错事亏待了女人，我宁愿亏待我自己也不能亏待她。我希望我一个人为这事费心就行了，皮普。我希望你不用挨挠痒棍的打，老弟。要挨打我也希望都由我来挨，但事情就是这样曲曲折折的、不顺利，我希望你能忽略这些缺点。”","“And I can’t a master-mind,” Joe resumed, when he had unfixed his look, and got back to his whisker.“And last of all, Pip—and this I want to say very serious to you, old chap—I see so much in my poor mother, of a woman drudging and slaving and breaking her honest hart and never getting no peace in her mortal days, that I’m dead faired of going wrong in the way of not doing what’s right by a woman, and I’d fur rather of the two go wrong the totter way, and be a little ill-convenience myself.I wish it was only me that got put out, Pip; I wish there wasn’t no Tickler for you, old chap; I wish I could take it all on myself; but this is the up-and-down-and-straight on it, Pip, and I hope you’ll overlook shortcomings.”"
"尽管那时我还小，但我相信，从那天晚上开始，我对乔又增添了一份崇敬之情。在那之后，我们仍像之前一样平等地对待彼此。但是，在那之后，每当我静静地坐着，看着乔，想着乔，一种新的感觉就会油然而生。这种感觉让我意识到，我从心眼里敬佩乔。","Young as I was, I believe that I dated a new admiration of Joe from that night.We were equals afterwards, as we had been before; but, afterwards at quiet times when I sat looking at Joe and thinking about him, I had a new sensation of feeling conscious that I was looking up to Joe in my heart."
"“可是，”乔说着起身又添满了火，“这座荷兰钟都快要敲八点了，她还没有回来！但愿彭波契克舅舅的那匹母马没有前蹄踩到冰面而摔倒。”","“However,” said Joe, rising to replenish the fire; “here’s the Dutch-clock a working himself up to being equal to strike Eight of ’em, and she’s not come home yet!I hope Uncle Pumblechook’s merman’s have set a fore-foot on a piece o’ ice, and gone down.”"
"乔太太有时和彭波契克舅舅一起去赶集，帮他买些需要参考女人意见的家居用品和生活用品。彭波契克舅舅是个单身汉，而且一点都不信任他家的仆人。今天是个赶集日，乔太太又陪他去赶集了。","Mrs. Joe made occasional trips with Uncle Pumblechook on market-days, to assist him in buying such household stuffs and goods as required a woman’s judgment; Uncle Pumblechook being a bachelor and reposing no confidences in his domestic servant.This was market-day, and Mrs. Joe was out on one of these expeditions."
"乔生好火，把火炉周围打扫干净。然后我们走到门口，听听有没有轻便马车的声音。那天晚上又干又冷，大风猛吹，地上的寒霜又白又厚。我寻思着，要是今晚有人躺在沼泽地里的话，一定会被冻死。然后我看着星星，不禁想到，一个人在快被冻死的时候仰望星空，他该有多难过啊。群星闪耀，他却看不到一丝帮助，一丝同情。","Joe made the fire and swept the hearth, and then we went to the door to listen for the chaise-cart.It was a dry cold night, and the wind blew keenly, and the frost was white and hard.A man would die to-night of lying out on the marshes, I thought.And then I looked at the stars, and considered how awful if would be for a man to turn his face up to them as he froze to death, and see no help or pity in all the glittering multitude."
"“那匹母马回来了，”乔说道，“声音就像铃铛响！”","“Here comes the mare,” said Joe, “ringing like a peal of bells!”"
"母马的马蹄铁敲打着坚实的路面，声音非常有乐感。她一路轻快地跑来，速度比平时快得多。我们搬出一张椅子，好让乔太太踩着它下马车。我们拨旺了炉火，这样他们就能看到明亮的窗户。我们又最后一次检查了厨房，保证一切都整整齐齐的。我们刚完成了这些准备工作，他们就到了，身上的衣服裹得严严实实的，只露出眼睛。很快乔太太下了车，随后彭波契克舅舅也下了车。他给母马盖上一块布之后，我们就很快地来到了厨房。我们带进来的寒气太多，仿佛一下子就把炉火的热气都赶跑了。","The sound of her iron shoes upon the hard road was quite musical, as she came along at a much brisker trot than usual.We got a chair out, ready for Mrs. Joe’s alighting, and stirred up the fire that they might see a bright window, and took a final survey of the kitchen that nothing might be out of its place.When we had completed these preparations, they drove up, wrapped to the eyes. Mrs. Joe was soon landed, and Uncle Pumblechook was soon down too, covering the mare with a cloth, and we were soon all in the kitchen, carrying so much cold air in with us that it seemed to drive all the heat out of the fire."
"“听着，”乔太太一边说着，一边匆忙而兴奋地解开外套，把帽子推到肩后，帽绳还系在脖子上，“要是这小子今晚还不知道感恩的话，那他永远都不会了！”","“Now,” said Mrs. Joe, unwrapping herself with haste and excitement, and throwing her bonnet back on her shoulders where it hung by the strings: “if this boy can’t grateful this night, he never will be!”"
"我尽可能地做出一副感恩的样子，但却全然不知我为什么要做出这样的表情。","I looked as grateful as any boy possibly could, who was wholly uninformed why he ought to assume that expression."
"“我仅仅是希望，”我姐姐说，“他不会被宠坏了。但我还是担心。”","“It’s only to be hoped,” said my sister, “that he won’t be Pomp-eyed.But I have my fears.”"
"“她不会那样做的，夫人。”彭波契克舅舅说道，“她知道该怎么做。”","“She can’t in that line, Mum,” said Mr. Pumblechook.“She knows better.”"
"她？我看着乔，朝他努了努嘴，挤了挤眉，“她？”乔也看着我，朝我努了努嘴，挤了挤眉，“她？”他的这个动作被我姐姐看到了，他马上抬起手背揉了揉鼻子，做出在类似情况下他那种一贯的妥协姿态，看着她。","She?I looked at Joe, making the motion with my lips and eyebrows, “She?”Joe looked at me, making the motion with his lips and eyebrows, “She?”My sister catching him in the act, he drew the back of his hand across his nose with his usual conciliatory air on such occasions, and looked at her."
"“怎么了？”我姐姐恶狠狠地说，“你瞪什么？房子着火了？”","“Well?” said my sister, in her snappish way. “What are you staring at?Is the house a-fire?”"
"“——是一个人，”乔礼貌地暗示道，“刚刚提到的——她。”","“—Which some individual,” Joe politely hinted, “mentioned—she.”"
"“我看,她就是她啊。”我姐姐说，“难道你要把郝维仙小姐称为‘他’吗？我想你不会糊涂到那种地步吧。”","“And she is a she, I suppose?” said my sister. “Unless you call Miss Havisham a he.And I doubt if even you’ll go so far as that.”"
"“住在镇上的那个郝维仙小姐吗？”乔说道。","“Miss Havisham, up town?” said Joe. "
"“乡下还有哪个郝维仙小姐吗？”我姐姐回答道，","“Is there any Miss Havisham down town?” returned my sister. "
"“她想要这个小子过去玩。当然，他会去的。而且他最好去那里玩，”我姐姐说着对我摇了摇头，以此来鼓励我要表现得非常活泼好动，“否则我会修理他的。”","“She wants this boy to go and play there.And of course he’s going. And he had better play there,” said my sister, shaking her head at me as an encouragement to be extremely light and sportive, “or I’ll work him.”"
"我之前听说过这位住在镇上的郝维仙小姐——方圆几英里之内的每一个人都听说过镇上的郝维仙小姐——她非常有钱，为人冷酷、威严，在一所阴森的大房子里过着离群索居的生活。整个房子为了防范窃贼设置了重重障碍。","I had heard of Miss Havisham up town—everybody for miles round, had heard of Miss Havisham up town—as an immensely rich and grim lady who lived in a large and dismal house barricaded against robbers, and who led a life of seclusion."
"“哦，真没想到！”乔吃惊地说，“我纳闷的是,她怎么知道皮普的！”","“Well to be sure!” said Joe, astounded. “I wonder how she come to know Pip!”"
"“一根筋！”我姐姐喊道，“谁说她知道皮普？”","“Noodle!” cried my sister. “Who said she knew him?”"
"“——有人，”乔又礼貌地暗示道，“刚提到说，她想让他去那里玩。”","“—Which some individual,” Joe again politely hinted, “mentioned that she wanted him to go and play there.”"
"“难道她不能问问彭波契克舅舅，是不是知道哪个男孩能过去玩吗？难道没有一点点可能是因为彭波契克舅舅是她的房客，他有时候——我们不会告诉你是三个月一次还是半年一次，说了你也搞不清楚——但就是有些时候——要去那里向她付房租吗？难道她就不能问问彭波契克舅舅，他知不知道哪个男孩能过去玩吗？难道一向对我们细心周到的彭波契克舅舅——尽管你可能不这么认为，约瑟夫，”我姐姐用最严厉的谴责口吻说道，仿佛他是天底下最无情的外甥，“就不能提到这个神气活现地站在这里的小子”——关于这一点我郑重声明，当时我并没有神气活现——“这个我一直都给他当牛做马的小子吗？”","“And couldn’t she ask Uncle Pumblechook if he knew of a boy to go and play there?Isn’t it just barely possible that Uncle Pumblechook may be a tenant of hers, and that he may sometimes—we won’t say quarterly or half-yearly, for that would be requiring too much of you—but sometimes—go there to pay his rent?And couldn’t she then asks Uncle Pumblechook if he knew of a boy to go and play there?And couldn’t Uncle Pumblechook, being always considerate and thoughtful for us—though you may not think it, Joseph,” in a tone of the deepest reproach, as if he were the most callous of nephews, “then mention this boy, standing Prancing here”—which I solemnly declare I was not doing—“that I have for ever been a willing slave to?”"
"“说得好！”彭波契克舅舅喊道，“说得好！一语中的！实在是好啊！约瑟夫，这下你明白了吧。”","“Good again!” cried Uncle Pumblechook. “Well put!Prettily pointed! Good indeed!Now Joseph, you know the case.”"
"“不，约瑟夫，”我姐姐仍然用责备的口气说道，而乔则满怀歉意地用手背揉搓着他的鼻子，“你还没有明白，尽管你可能还没有意识到这一点。你可能觉得你懂了，但你还没懂，约瑟夫。因为你不知道彭波契克舅舅多么通情达理。他知道这小子可能因为到郝维仙小姐那里而从此交上了好运，所以他主动提出，今晚用他自己的轻便马车把这孩子带到镇里，晚上留他住一夜，明天早上亲自把他送到郝维仙小姐那里。上帝饶恕我！”我姐姐喊道，并且猛地一把扯下她的帽子，“我净顾站着和傻瓜说话了，让彭波契克舅舅等了这么久，门口的母马也要被冻感冒了。而且这小子从发梢到脚跟都是泥土灰尘，看起来糟透了！”","“No, Joseph,” said my sister, still in a reproachful manner, while Joe apologetically drew the back of his hand across and across his nose, “you do not yet—though you may not think it—know the case.You may consider that you do, but you do not, Joseph.For you do not know that Uncle Pumblechook, being sensible that for anything we can tell, this boy’s fortune may be made by his going to Miss Havisham’s, has offered to take him into town to-night in his own chaise-cart, and to keep him to-night, and to take him with his own hands to Miss Havisham’s tomorrow morning.And Lor-a-mussy me!” cried my sister, casting off her bonnet in sudden desperation, “here I stand talking to mere Mooncalves, with Uncle Pumblechook waiting, and the mare catching cold at the door, and the boy grimed with crock and dirt from the hair of his head to the sole of his foot!”"
"说完这些，她一下子过来抓住了我，就像老鹰扑向一只小羊羔一样。接着我的脸就被摁进水池里的木盆当中，我的头被放在大水桶的龙头下面。然后给我打肥皂，揉啊，搓啊，擦啊，拍啊，挠啊，刮啊，一直到我都快受不了了。（这里我要说明的是，与当今任何一位权威相比，我觉得我更了解用一枚结婚戒指在人的脸上划来划去会产生什么样的效果，结果就是留下一道道隆起的痕迹。）","With that, she pounced upon me, like an eagle on a lamb, and my face was squeezed into wooden bowls in sinks, and my head was put under taps of water-butts, and I was soaped, and kneaded, and toweled, and thumped, and harrowed, and rasped, until I really was quite beside myself.(I may here remark that I suppose myself to be better acquainted than any living authority, with the ridge effect of a wedding-ring, passing unsympathetically over the human countenance.)"
"当我的洗浴结束之后，她给我穿上干净却非常僵硬、直挺的亚麻布衣服，就像给少年犯穿上麻袋布衣服一样。然后又给我捆绑了一件非常紧的外套，勒得我非常难受。然后我就被交给了彭波契克舅舅。他犹如郡长一般正式地接纳了我，而且对我发表了他的演讲。我知道这些话他早就想对我说了：“孩子，要永远感谢所有的朋友，尤其要感谢那些亲手把你带大的人！”","When my ablutions were completed, I was put into clean linen of the stiffest character, like a young penitent into sackcloth, and was trussed up in my tightest and fear fullest suit.I was then delivered over to Mr. Pumblechook, who formally received me as if he were the Sheriff, and who let off upon me the speech that I knew he had been dying to make all along: “Boy, be for ever grateful to all friends, but especially unto them which brought you up by hand!”"
"“再见，乔！”","“Good-bye, Joe!”"
"“上帝保佑你，皮普，我的老弟！”","“God bless you, Pip, old chap!”"
"在这之前我从来没有和乔分开过。怀着复杂的心情，眼睛里还留着肥皂水，我坐在了轻便马车里。刚坐下的时候我看不到星星。随后它们又一颗一颗地闪现出来，但却无法回答我的问题：我究竟为什么要到郝维仙小姐家去玩？它们究竟要让我玩什么呢？","I had never parted from him before, and what with my feelings and what with soap-suds, I could at first see no stars from the chaise-cart.But they twinkled out one by one, without throwing any light on the questions why on earth I was going to play at Miss Havisham’s, and what on earth I was expected to play at."
"第八章","Chapter 8"
"彭波契克先生的房屋坐落在集镇的大街上，有一种干胡椒和鼠尾草的风格，而这种房屋正是每一个经营粮食和种子的商人所应该有的房屋。在我看来，他一定是一个非常幸福的人，因为在他商店里有那么多小抽屉。我朝下层的一两个抽屉里偷看了几眼，看到里面有扎紧口的棕色纸包。我想知道，里面的花种和花茎是否想找个好天，冲破这纸做的牢狱，开花结果。","Mr. Pumblechook’s premises in the High-street of the market town were of a pepper corny and farinaceous character, as the premises of a corn-chandler and seeds man should be.It appeared to me that he must be a very happy man indeed, to have so many little drawers in his shop; and I wondered when I peeped into one or two on the lower tiers, and saw the tied-up brown paper packets inside, whether the flower-seeds and bulbs ever wanted of a fine day to break out of those jails, and bloom."
"我是在来这里之后的第二天清晨产生了这种思考。前一天晚上，我被径直送进一个斜屋顶的小阁楼去睡觉。床放在角落里，那里的屋顶非常低，我躺在床上估算了一下，觉得瓦片与我眉毛之间的距离不超过一英尺。也就是在那个清晨，我发现种子和灯芯绒之间有一种奇特的密切关系。彭波契克先生穿着灯芯绒料的衣服，他的店员也穿着灯芯绒料的衣服。而且不知为何，灯芯绒的气味非常像种子的气味，而种子的气味又非常像灯芯绒的气味，弄得我都分辨不出来哪个是哪个。同时我还注意到，彭波契克先生似乎靠盯着街对面的马具商来经营他的生意；马具商靠盯着马车修理匠来打理他的生意；马车修理匠靠两手插在口袋里，凝视着面包师傅来谋生；面包师傅则双臂交叉在胸前，盯着杂货商；而杂货商则站在门口，对着药剂师打哈欠。修表匠总是眼上戴个放大镜，伏在一张小桌子上仔细研究着。而且在他的商店窗户外，总有一群穿着肥大连衣裙的女人窥视着他。修表匠似乎是整条大街上唯一一个把注意力放在自己生意上的人。","It was in the early morning after my arrival that I entertained this speculation.On the previous night, I had been sent straight to bed in an attic with a sloping roof, which was so low in the corner where the bedstead was, that I calculated the tiles as being within a foot of my eyebrows.In the same early morning, I discovered a singular affinity between seeds and corduroys.Mr. Pumblechook wore corduroys, and so did his shop man; and somehow, there was a general air and flavor about the corduroys, so much in the nature of seeds, and a general air and flavor about the seeds, so much in the nature of corduroys, that I hardly knew which was which.The same opportunity served me for noticing that Mr. Pumblechook appeared to conduct his business by looking across the street at the saddler, who appeared to transact his business by keeping his eye on the coach-maker, who appeared to get on in life by putting his hands in his pockets and contemplating the baker, who in his turn folded his arms and stared at the grocer, who stood at his door and yawned at the chemist. The watch-maker, always poring over a little desk with a magnifying glass at his eye, and always inspected by a group of smock-frocks poring over him through the glass of his shop-window, seemed to be about the only person in the High-street whose trade engaged his attention."
"八点钟的时候我和彭波契克先生在店铺后面的客厅吃早餐。此时店员坐在前堂的一袋豆子上，拿着一大杯茶，吃着黄油面包。我觉得，彭波契克先生是个让人无法忍受的同伴。他满脑子都是我姐姐的那套理论，那就是在我吃饭的时候也要让我难为情，让我悔悟。他给我的都是面包屑外加一点点的黄油，在我的牛奶中加了大量温水，其实还不如更直接地把牛奶都一起省掉算了。除此之外，他的谈话内容没有别的，只有算术题。在我礼貌地跟他说了“早上好”之后，他趾高气扬地说道：“七乘九等于多少，小子？”我身处一个陌生的地方，腹中空空，又想尽量逃避这种问题，在这种情况之下，叫我怎么回答得出来呢！我很饿，但我还没来得及吞下一点食物，他就开始问一长串的算术题，整整持续了整个早餐时间。“七乘七？”“七乘四？”“七乘八？”“七乘六？”“七乘二？”","Mr. Pumblechook and I breakfasted at eight o’clock in the parlor behind the shop, while the shop man took his mug of tea and hunch of bread-and-butter on a sack of peas in the front premises.I considered Mr. Pumblechook wretched company.Besides being possessed by my sister’s idea that a mortifying and penitential character ought to be imparted to my diet—besides giving me as much crumb as possible in combination with as little butter, and putting such a quantity of warm water into my milk that it would have been more candid to have left the milk out altogether—his conversation consisted of nothing but arithmetic.On my politely bidding him Good morning, he said, pompously, “Seven times nine, boy?”And how should I be able to answer, dodged in that way, in a strange place, on an empty stomach!I was hungry, but before I had swallowed a morsel, he began a running sum that lasted all through the breakfast.“Seven?”“And four?”“And eight?”“And six?”“And two?”"
"“七乘十？”诸如此类。每次一个数字算完之后，我刚刚咬上一口或喝上一口，下一道题就来了。而他却舒舒服服地坐在那里，毫不费脑地大吃培根和热面包圈。（如果我可以用下面这些形容词的话）他简直就是在狼吞虎咽。","“And ten?”And so on.And after each figure was disposed of, it was as much as I could do to get a bite or a sup, before the next came; while he sat at his ease guessing nothing, and eating bacon and hot roll, in (if I may be allowed the expression) a gorging and gormandizing manner."
"因此我非常高兴终于到了十点钟，我们要出发去郝维仙小姐家了。不过，我一想起在那位小姐家应该如何表现，心里就不自在。不到一刻钟，我们就到了郝维仙小姐家门口。房屋的砖瓦看起来很古老，整个房屋阴沉沉的，周围有很多铁栅栏。有些窗户已经被封死了，剩下的窗户当中，低矮的那些都装着锈迹斑斑的铁栏。房前有个庭院，也被铁栏围住了。所以按了门铃之后，我们就得一直等，直到有人来开门。当我们在门口等的时候，我朝里面窥视了几眼（即使在这个时候，彭波契克先生还在问：“七乘十四等于多少？”但我装作没听见），看到房子的一侧有一个大酿酒作坊。此时作坊没有酿酒，而且似乎已经很长时间不酿酒了。","For such reasons I was very glad when ten o’clock came and we started for Miss Havisham’s; though I was not at all at my ease regarding the manner in which I should acquit myself under that lady’s roof.Within a quarter of an hour we came to Miss Havisham’s house, which was of old brick, and dismal, and had a great many iron bars to it.Some of the windows had been walled up; of those that remained, all the lower were rustily barred.There was a court-yard in front, and that was barred; so, we had to wait, after ringing the bell, until some one should come to open it.While we waited at the gate, I peeped in (even then Mr. Pumblechook said, “And fourteen?” but I pretended not to hear him), and saw that at the side of the house there was a large brewery. No brewing was going on in it, and none seemed to have gone on for a long time."
"一扇窗户被打开了，一个清脆的声音问道：“是谁呀？”带我来的人回答道：“彭波契克。”那个声音回道：“知道了。”然后窗户又被关上了。随后一个年轻的小姐手拿着院门钥匙，穿过庭院走了过来。","A window was raised, and a clear voice demanded “What name?”To which my conductor replied, “Pumble chook.”The voice returned, “Quite right,” and the window was shut again, and a young lady came across the court-yard, with keys in her hand."
"“这个，”彭波契克说，“是皮普。”","“This,” said Mr. Pumblechook, “is Pip.”"
"“这是皮普，是吗？”这位年轻的小姐回答说，她很漂亮而且看起来很骄傲，“进来吧，皮普。”","“This is Pip, is it?” returned the young lady, who was very pretty and seemed very proud; “come in, Pip.”"
"彭波契克先生也想跟着进来，但她关上了门，把他堵在了门外。","Mr. Pumblechook was coming in also, when she stopped him with the gate."
"“噢！”她说道，“你想见郝维仙小姐吗？”","“Oh!” She said. “Did you wish to see Miss Havisham?”"
"“如果郝维仙小姐想见我的话。”彭波契克先生尴尬地回答道。","“If Miss Havisham wished to see me,” returned Mr. Pumblechook, discomfited."
"“哦！”这个女孩说，“但跟你说吧，她不想见你。”","“Ah!” said the girl; “but you see she don’t.”"
"她说得非常坚决，毫无商量的余地。彭波契克先生虽然尊严扫地，却无法反抗。但是他恶狠狠地盯着我——仿佛是我对他做了什么！——离开之前还留下几句责备的话：“小子！要让你在这里的表现给那些亲手把你带大的人争光！”我仍然担心他会返回来，隔着大门对我提问：“七乘十六等于多少？”但是他没有。","She said it so finally, and in such a undiscussible way, that Mr. Pumblechook, though in a condition of ruffled dignity, could not protest.But he eyed me severely—as if I had done anything to him!—and departed with the words reproachfully delivered: “Boy!Let your behavior here be a credit unto them which brought you up by hand!”I was not free from apprehension that he would come back to propound through the gate, “And sixteen?”But he didn’t."
"给我引路的年轻小姐锁上了门，然后我们穿过庭院走进去。道路铺着石板，路面很干净，但每个石板夹缝中都长着草。酿酒作坊通过一条小径与房屋相连。小径上的木门都敞开着，酿酒作坊也敞开着，不远处就是高高的围墙。作坊里空荡荡的，已经不再使用了。那里吹的冷风似乎比门外的冷风更加寒冷。而且冷风在酿酒作坊敞开的门窗里吹进吹出时发出尖利、刺耳的噪音，这种噪音就像是海上航船绳索之间的风声。","My young conductress locked the gate, and we went across the court-yard.It was paved and clean, but grass was growing in every crevice.The brewery buildings had a little lane of communication with it, and the wooden gates of that lane stood open, and all the brewery beyond, stood open, away to the high enclosing wall; and all was empty and disused.The cold wind seemed to blow colder there, than outside the gate; and it made a shrill noise in howling in and out at the open sides of the brewery, like the noise of wind in the rigging of a ship at sea."
"她见我在看着酿酒作坊就说：“孩子，现在你哪怕喝光那里现在酿制的烈啤酒也不会挨打。”","She saw me looking at it, and she said, “You could drink without hurt all the strong beer that’s brewed there now, boy.”"
"“我想是的，小姐。”我羞涩地说。","“I should think I could, miss,” said I, in a shy way."
"“现在最好不要在那里酿酒，否则酒会很酸的，孩子，你说对吗？”","“Better not try to brew beer there now, or it would turn out sour, boy; don’t you think so?”"
"“看上去是的，小姐。”","“It looks like it, miss.”"
"“没有人想用它来酿酒。”她接着说道，“因为酒已经酿过了，这个地方就继续像现在这样闲置着，一直到它倒塌为止。至于烈啤酒，酒窖里已经有足够多的烈酒了，可以淹没这座庄园宅邸。”","“Not that anybody means to try,” she added, “for that’s all done with, and the place will stand as idle as it is, till it falls.As to strong beer, there’s enough of it in the cellars already, to drown the Manor House.”"
"“那是这座房子的名字吗，小姐？”","“Is that the name of this house, miss?”"
"“其中的一个名字，孩子。”","“One of its names, boy.”"
"“那它的名字不止一个了，小姐？”","“It has more than one, then, missed?”"
"“还有一个。它另一个名字是沙提斯，可能是希腊语，或拉丁语，或希伯来语，或三种都是——对我来说都是一个意思——就是‘足够’的意思。”","“One more.Its other name was Satis; which is Greek, or Latin, or Hebrew, or all three—or all one to me—for enough.”"
"“足够宅邸，”我说道，“那是个挺奇怪的名字，小姐。”","“Enough House,” said I; “that’s a curious name, miss.”"
"“是的，”她回答说，“但是它隐含的意义比它的字面意思要大得多。它意味着不管是谁，一旦拥有了这座房子就别无所求了。我想，那个时候的人们一定非常容易满足。不过，别磨蹭了，孩子。”","“Yes,” she replied; “but it meant more than it said.It meant, when it was given, that whoever had this house, could want nothing else. They must have been easily satisfied in those days, I should think. But don’t loiter, boy.”"
"尽管她口口声声叫我“孩子”，漫不经心而又毫无赞美之意，但其实她的年龄与我相当。当然，她看起来比我大多了。作为一个女孩子，她很漂亮也很得体。她看不起我，仿佛自己已经是个二十一岁的女王了。","Though she called me “boy” so often, and with a carelessness that was far from complimentary, she was of about my own age.She seemed much older than I, of course, being a girl, and beautiful and self-possessed; and she was as scornful of me as if she had been one-and-twenty, and a queen."
"我们从一扇侧门进入房屋——大前门的外边拴着两条铁链——我最先注意到的是，走廊里漆黑一片，她之前在那里留下一根点亮的蜡烛。她拿起蜡烛，我们又往前走过几个过道，走上楼梯，一路上仍然是一片漆黑，只有那根蜡烛给我们照亮。","We went into the house by a side door—the great front entrance had two chains across it outside—and the first thing I noticed was, that the passages were all dark, and that she had left a candle burning there.She took it up, and we went through more passages and up a staircase, and still it was all dark, and only the candle lighted us."
"最后，我们来到一个房门口，她说：“进去。”","At last we came to the door of a room, and she said, “Go in.”"
"我更多的是出于羞涩而不是出于礼貌地回答说：“您先请，小姐。”","I answered, more in shyness than politeness, “After you, miss.”"
"听到我的话，她回道：“别犯傻了，孩子，我不进去。”然后她鄙视地走开了，而且——更糟的是——把蜡烛一起带走了。","To this, she returned: “Don’t be ridiculous, boy; I am not going in.”And scornfully walked away, and—what was worse—took the candle with her."
"这让我很不自在，而且多半还有些害怕。然而，唯一能做的事情就是敲门，于是我敲了门，里面传来一个声音叫我进去。因此我进了门，发现自己置身于一个很大的房间之中，很多蜡烛将房间照得很明亮。房间里看不到一丝日光。我从家具上推断，这是个更衣室，尽管当时有很多家具我还不认识。但是屋里最突出的是一张罩着台布的桌子，桌上带了一张镀金的梳妆镜。我一眼就看出，这是一位贵妇人的梳妆台。","This was very uncomfortable, and I was half afraid.However, the only thing to be done being to knock at the door, I knocked, and was told from within to enter.I entered, therefore, and found myself in a pretty large room, well lighted with wax candles.No glimpse of daylight was to be seen in it.It was a dressing-room, as I supposed from the furniture, though much of it was of forms and uses then quite unknown to me.But prominent in it was a draped table with a gilded looking-glass, and that I made out at first sight to be a fine lady’s dressing-table."
"如果不是当时有位贵妇人坐在那里，很难说我还会不会这么快就得出结论。她坐在一张扶手椅上，把一只胳膊肘放在梳妆台上，头斜靠着这只手。她是我到那时为止所见过的最奇怪的妇人，甚至是我这辈子见过的最奇怪的妇人。","Whether I should have made out this object so soon, if there had been no fine lady sitting at it, I cannot say.In an arm-chair, with an elbow resting on the table and her head leaning on that hand, sat the strangest lady I have ever seen, or shall ever see."
"她穿的衣服都是名贵料子——缎子、蕾丝、丝绸——全都是白色的。她的鞋也是白色的。一条长长的白色面纱从她头发上垂下来，她头上戴着新娘花饰，但她的头发却白了。她脖子上和手上有些亮晶晶的珠宝首饰在闪闪发光，梳妆台上散落着另外一些闪闪发亮的珠宝首饰。比她身上穿着的那件差一点的衣服以及一些没收拾好的箱子散落得到处都是。她还没有打扮好，因为她只穿了一只鞋——另一只鞋放在梳妆台上，靠近她手边——面纱只整理好一半，手表和手链还没有戴上，一些胸花和那些小首饰玩意、手帕、手套、几朵花以及一本祈祷书都胡乱地堆在梳妆镜的周围。","She was dressed in rich materials—satins, and lace, and silks—all of white.Her shoes were white.And she had a long white veil dependent from her hair, and she had bridal flowers in her hair, but her hair was white.Some bright jewels sparkled on her neck and on her hands, and some other jewels lay sparkling on the table. Dresses, less splendid than the dress she wore, and half-packed trunks, were scattered about.She had not quite finished dressing, for she had but one shoe on—the other was on the table near her hand—her veil was but half arranged, her watch and chain were not put on, and some lace for her bosom lay with those trinkets, and with her handkerchief, and gloves, and some flowers, and a prayer-book, all confusedly heaped about the looking-glass."
"我并不是从一开始就看到了所有这些东西，尽管我在一开始看到的东西比预想的要多。但是我看到，我视线之内的所有应该是白色的东西都因为时间太长而失去了光泽。它们的颜色褪去，变得发黄。我看到，这个穿着新娘礼服的新娘已经像这身礼服和那些花一样枯萎了，除了她深陷下去的眼睛里还有光彩之外，再没留下其他一丝光彩了。我看到，这身礼服以前是穿在一个年轻女子丰满的体形之上的，而如今，穿礼服的身体已经是骨瘦如柴了，套在外面的礼服显得空荡荡的。有一次，我被带到集市上去看一个令人毛骨悚然的蜡像，我不知道它代表的是哪一位正躺着供人瞻仰的、了不起的名流。还有一次，我被带到一座位于我们那边沼泽地上的老教堂。在那里我看到一具从教堂人行路下的地下墓室中挖出来的骷髅，骷髅身上穿的华丽的衣服已经成灰。如今，蜡像和骷髅似乎在转动着他们的黑眼睛，看着我。如果我能叫的话，我一定早就叫出来了。","It was not in the first few moments that I saw all these things, though I saw more of them in the first moments than might be supposed.But, I saw that everything within my view which ought to be white, had been white long ago, and had lost its luster, and was faded and yellow.I saw that the bride within the bridal dress had withered like the dress, and like the flowers, and had no brightness left but the brightness of her sunken eyes.I saw that the dress had been put upon the rounded figure of a young woman, and that the figure upon which it now hung loose, had shrunk to skin and bone.Once, I had been taken to see some ghastly waxwork at the Fair, representing I know not what impossible personage lying in state.Once, I had been taken to one of our old marsh churches to see a skeleton in the ashes of a rich dress, that had been dug out of a vault under the church pavement.Now, waxwork and skeleton seemed to have dark eyes that moved and looked at me.I should have cried out, if I could."
"“是谁？”坐在梳妆台旁的夫人说道。","“Who is it?” said the lady at the table."
"“我是皮普，夫人。”","“Pip, ma’am.”"
"“皮普？”","“Pip?”"
"“彭波契克先生带来的那个孩子，夫人。来这里——来这里玩的。”","“Mr. Pumblechook’s boy, ma’am.Come—to play.”"
"“走近一点，让我看看你。靠近一点。”","“Come nearer; let me look at you.Come close.”"
"当我站在她面前，躲避着她的目光时，我才仔细注意到周围的东西，发现她的表停在八点四十，屋里的一座钟也停在八点四十。","It was when I stood before her, avoiding her eyes, that I took note of the surrounding objects in detail, and saw that her watch had stopped at twenty minutes to nine, and that a clock in the room had stopped at twenty minutes to nine."
"“看着我。”郝维仙小姐说道，“你不害怕一个自从你出生以来就从没见过太阳的女人吗？”","“Look at me,” said Miss Havisham.“You are not afraid of a woman who has never seen the sun since you were born?”"
"遗憾地说，我一点都不害怕地在我的回答当中撒了一个天大的谎：“不害怕。”","I regret to state that I was not afraid of telling the enormous lie comprehended in the answer “No.”"
"“你知道我触摸的地方是什么？”她说着把两只手叠放在她的左胸口上。","“Do you know what I touch here?” she said, laying her hands, one upon the other, on her left side."
"“我知道，夫人。”（这让我想起那个年轻人。）","“Yes, ma’am.”(It made me think of the young man.)"
"“我触摸的地方是什么？”","“What do I touch?”"
"“是您的心。”","“Your heart.”"
"“碎了！”","“Broken!”"
"她说出这个词的时候脸上一副迫切的神情，语气特别重，而且带着一种奇怪的笑容，似乎有几分自豪的意味。之后，她把手放在那里一会儿，然后慢慢移开，仿佛双手很沉重似的。","She uttered the word with an eager look, and with strong emphasis, and with a weird smile that had a kind of boast in it.Afterwards, she kept her hands there for a little while, and slowly took them away as if they were heavy."
"“我厌烦了。”郝维仙小姐说道，“我想换个花样，我也玩腻了男男女女的事情。玩吧。”","“I am tired,” said Miss Havisham.“I want diversion, and I have done with men and women.Play.”"
"我想，我最好争论的读者也会承认，几乎没有什么事情会比她让我这个不幸的孩子在这种情况下所做的事情更难了。","I think it will be conceded by my most disputatious reader, that she could hardly have directed an unfortunate boy to do anything in the wide world more difficult to be done under the circumstances."
"“我有时候会有一些古怪的幻想。”她继续说道，“我产生这种古怪幻想时就想看着别人玩。在那儿，在那儿！”她用右手手指做了个不耐烦地手势，“玩啊，玩啊，玩！”","“I sometimes have sick fancies,” she went on, “and I have a sick fancy that I want to see some play.There there!” with an impatient movement of the fingers of her right hand; “play, play, play!”"
"在那一刹那，我眼前出现了我姐姐正修理我的画面。绝望之下，我萌生了一个念头，就是扮作彭波契克先生的轻便马车在屋子里开始转圈。但是我觉得自己完全胜任不了这种表演，所以放弃了这个想法。我站在那里看着郝维仙小姐，我猜想她认为我那副表情很顽固，因为当我们都仔细观察了对方之后，她说道：","For a moment, with the fear of my sister’s working me before my eyes, I had a desperate idea of starting round the room in the assumed character of Mr. Pumblechook’s chaise-cart.But, I felt myself so unequal to the performance that I gave it up, and stood looking at Miss Havisham in what I suppose she took for a dogged manner, inasmuch as she said, when we had taken a good look at each other:"
"“你很不高兴，很执拗吗？”","“Are you sullen and obstinate?”"
"“不是的，夫人，我很抱歉，很抱歉我现在不能玩。如果你抱怨我的话，我姐姐就会找我麻烦。所以只要我能做的我一定会做，但这里那么新奇，那么陌生，那么美好——而且那么让人悲伤——”我停了下来，害怕自己会说得太多了，或者已经说得太多了。我们又彼此看了对方一眼。","“No, ma’am, I am very sorry for you, and very sorry I can’t play just now.If you complain of me I shall get into trouble with my sister, so I would do it if I could; but it’s so new here, and so strange, and so fine—and melancholy—.”I stopped, fearing I might say too much, or had already said it, and we took another look at each other."
"在她再次开口说话之前，她把目光从我身上移开，看了看她穿的衣服，看了看梳妆台，最后看着梳妆镜中的自己。","Before she spoke again, she turned her eyes from me, and looked at the dress she wore, and at the dressing-table, and finally at herself in the looking-glass."
"“对他来说那么新奇，”她低语道，“对我来说那么陈旧；对他来说那么陌生，对我来说那么熟悉；对我们两个人来说都那么让人悲伤！叫埃斯特拉来。”","“So new to him,” she muttered, “so old to me; so strange to him, so familiar to me; so melancholy to both of us!Call Estella.”"
"由于她还在看着镜子中的自己，我以为她还在自言自语，所以就保持了沉默。","As she was still looking at the reflection of herself, I thought she was still talking to herself, and kept quiet."
"“叫埃斯特拉来。”她重复了一遍，同时扫了我一眼。“这你可以做到。叫埃斯特拉来。到门口去叫。”","“Call Estella,” she repeated, flashing a look at me.“You can do that.Call Estella.At the door.”"
"黑暗之中，我站在一座陌生房子神秘的走廊上，对一个不见踪影、毫无回应、看不起人的年轻小姐大喊‘埃斯特拉’。同时我觉得大声喊出她的名字是一种极大的冒犯。这个命令跟让我玩一样糟糕。但是，最终她回应了。她顺着黑暗的过道走来，手中的光亮像星星一样。","To stand in the dark in a mysterious passage of an unknown house, bawling Estella to a scornful young lady neither visible nor responsive, and feeling it a dreadful liberty so to roar out her name, was almost as bad as playing to order.But, she answered at last, and her light came along the dark passage like a star."
"郝维仙小姐把她叫到跟前，从梳妆台上拿起一件宝石饰物，先放在她年轻姣好的胸脯前，然后放在她美丽的棕色头发上，来看这件宝石饰物佩戴起来的效果。“总有一天这会是你的，亲爱的。你会很好地利用它的。我要看你和这个孩子玩牌。”","Miss Havisham beckoned her to come close, and took up a jewel from the table, and tried its effect upon her fair young bosom and against her pretty brown hair.“Your own, one day, my dear, and you will use it well.Let me see you play cards with this boy.”"
"“和这个孩子？哎呀，他就是一个普通的、当苦力的孩子！”","“With this boy?Why, he is a common laboring-boy!”"
"我觉得，我听到了郝维仙小姐的回答——只是听起来非常不可思议——“那么，你可以让他心碎。”","I thought I overheard Miss Havisham answer—only it seemed so unlikely—“Well?You can break his heart.”"
"“你玩什么样的，孩子？”埃斯特拉非常轻蔑地问我。","“What do you play, boy?” asked Estella of myself, with the greatest disdain."
"“只会夺牌戏，其他的都不会，小姐。”","“Nothing but beggar my neighbor, miss.”"
"“夺他的牌。”郝维仙小姐对埃斯特拉说道。于是我们坐下来玩牌。","“Beggar him,” said Miss Havisham to Estella.So we sat down to cards."
"就在那个时候，我开始明白，屋子里的一切事物就像那只表和那座钟一样，在很久之前就已经停止了。我注意到，郝维仙小姐把那件宝石饰物放回到她拿起来的位置。在埃斯特拉发牌的时候，我又瞥了一眼梳妆台。我看见桌上那双曾经是白的而如今已经变黄的鞋子从来没有被穿过。我向下瞥去，看到那只没有穿鞋的脚。脚上的丝袜曾经是白色的，现在已经变黄了，而且已经被踩破了。要不是因为一切事物都停止了，所有苍白、腐朽的物体都一动不动的话，那身穿在已经走形的躯体之上的新娘礼服也不会看起来像殡服一样，长长的面纱也不会看起来像裹尸布一样。","It was then I began to understand that everything in the room had stopped, like the watch and the clock, a long time ago.I noticed that Miss Havisham put down the jewel exactly on the spot from which she had taken it up.As Estella dealt the cards, I glanced at the dressing-table again, and saw that the shoe upon it, once white, now yellow, had never been worn.I glanced down at the foot from which the shoe was absent, and saw that the silk stocking on it, once white, now yellow, had been trodden ragged.Without this arrest of everything, this standing still of all the pale decayed objects, not even the withered bridal dress on the collapsed from could have looked so like grave-clothes, or the long veil so like a shroud."
"当我们玩牌的时候，她就坐在那里，就像一具死尸，她新娘礼服上的褶边和饰物看起来就像土黄色的纸张。远古时代埋下去的尸体偶尔被发现后，在人们刚刚能清楚地看见它们的那一刻就化成了粉末。虽然那时我对此一无所知，但我经常想，她看起来绝对就像是只要白天有阳光射进来，就会被击成尘土一样。","So she sat, corpse-like, as we played at cards; the frillings and trimmings on her bridal dress, looking like earthy paper.I knew nothing then, of the discoveries that are occasionally made of bodies buried in ancient times, which fall to powder in the moment of being distinctly seen; but, I have often thought since, that she must have looked as if the admission of the natural light of day would have struck her to dust."
"“他把‘奈夫’叫做‘杰克’（注：‘奈夫’和‘杰克’是对纸牌中J的两种不同叫法），这个孩子！”埃斯特拉在我们第一局牌结束之前鄙夷地说道，“而且他的手多粗糙啊！还有，他的靴子多笨重啊！”","“He calls the knaves, Jacks, this boy!” said Estella with disdain, before our first game was out.“And what coarse hands he has!And what thick boots!”"
"我之前从来没有想过会因为我的手而感到羞耻，但现在我开始觉得这双手很难看。她对我的鄙视极其强烈，以至于开始传染起来，而我就被传染了。","I had never thought of being ashamed of my hands before; but I began to consider them a very indifferent pair.Her contempt for me was so strong, that it became infectious, and I caught it."
"她赢了这局牌，我得发牌。我发错牌了，这是很自然的，因为我知道她一直在暗中等着我出错，然后就来斥责我，说我是个愚蠢、笨拙、只能干苦力的小子。","She won the game, and I dealt.I misdealt, as was only natural, when I knew she was lying in wait for me to do wrong; and she denounced me for a stupid, clumsy laboring-boy."
"“你一句无礼的话都不对她说。”郝维仙小姐看着这一切，对我说道，“她对你说了很多难听的话，但你一句无礼的话也不对她说。你觉得她这个人怎么样？”","“You say nothing of her,” remarked Miss Havisham to me, as she looked on.“She says many hard things of you, but you say nothing of her.What do you think of her?”"
"“我不想说。”我结结巴巴地说。","“I don’t like to say,” I stammered."
"“在我耳边小声告诉我。”说着，郝维仙小姐弯下了腰。","“Tell me in my ear,” said Miss Havisham, bending down."
"“我觉得她特别高傲。”我小声回答道。","“I think she is very proud,” I replied, in a whisper."
"“其他的呢？”","“Anything else?”"
"“我觉得她很漂亮。”　","“I think she is very pretty.”"
"“还有吗？”","“Anything else?”"
"“我觉得她很无礼。”（这时埃斯特拉正带着一副非常厌恶的表情看着我。）","“I think she is very insulting.”(She was looking at me then with a look of supreme aversion.)"
"“别的呢？”","“Anything else?”"
"“我觉得我想回家了。”","“I think I should like to go home.”"
"“尽管她这么漂亮，也永远不想再看到她了？”","“And never see her again, though she is so pretty?”"
"“我不知道还想不想再看见她，但我现在想回家了。”","“I am not sure that I shouldn’t like to see her again, but I should like to go home now.”"
"“你很快就会回家了。”郝维仙小姐大声地说，“把这一局打完。”","“You shall go soon,” said Miss Havisham, aloud.“Play the game out.”"
"除了一开始那个古怪的笑容之外，我几乎可以肯定，郝维仙小姐的脸不会笑。她的脸已经深深地陷入了一种警惕、幽怨的神情——很可能是从她周围一切事物都停止的时候开始的——而且看起来仿佛没有什么能再让她高兴起来。她的胸脯陷下去了，所以她只能弓着背；她的声音衰弱了，所以她只能低声说话。由于全身上下笼罩着死一般的寂静，她看起来就像经受了一次惨重的打击，身体、灵魂、里里外外——整个人都陷了下去。","Saving for the one weird smile at first, I should have felt almost sure that Miss Havisham’s face could not smile.It had dropped into a watchful and brooding expression—most likely when all the things about her had become transfixed—and it looked as if nothing could ever lift it up again.Her chest had dropped, so that she stooped; and her voice had dropped, so that she spoke low, and with a dead lull upon her; altogether, she had the appearance of having dropped, body and soul, within and without, under the weight of a crushing blow."
"我和埃斯特拉打完了这局牌，她夺走了我所有的牌。她赢走了所有的牌，然后就把它们往桌子上一扔，仿佛因为是从我手里赢走的就很鄙视它们。","I played the game to an end with Estella, and she beggared me.She threw the cards down on the table when she had won them all, as if she despised them for having been won of me."
"“你什么时候会再来？”郝维仙小姐说道。“让我想一想。”","“When shall I have you here again?” said Miss Havisham.“Let me think.”"
"我正要提醒她今天是星期三，她就用右手手指做出之前那个不耐烦的手势打断了我。","I was beginning to remind her that today was Wednesday, when she checked me with her former impatient movement of the fingers of her right hand."
"“好了，好了！我不知道一个星期有哪几天，也不知道一年有哪几个星期。六天后再来。听到没有？”","“There, there! I know nothing of days of the week; I know nothing of weeks of the year.Come again after six days.You hear?”"
"“好的，夫人。”","“Yes, ma’am.”"
"“埃斯特拉，把他带下去吧。让他吃点东西，吃东西的时候让他四处逛一逛，看一看。走吧，皮普。”","“Estella, take him down.Let him have something to eat, and let him roam and look about him while he eats.Go, Pip.”"
"就像来时跟着烛光上楼一样，我跟着烛光下了楼。然后她把蜡烛放在我们拿起它的地方。在她打开侧门之前，我没有仔细思考就想当然地认为现在一定已经是晚上了。猛地射来的阳光一下子让我既困惑又惊讶，我感觉已经在那个点着蜡烛的陌生房间里呆了很多个小时了。","I followed the candle down, as I had followed the candle up, and she stood it in the place where we had found it.Until she opened the side entrance, I had fancied, without thinking about it, that it must necessarily be night-time.The rush of the daylight quite confounded me, and made me feel as if I had been in the candlelight of the strange room many hours."
"“你在这里等着，你这小子。”埃斯特拉说完，关上门就消失了。","“You are to wait here, you boy,” said Estella; and disappeared and closed the door."
"我利用一个人在院子里的时机，看了看我粗糙的双手和那双粗俗的靴子。我现在看那些衣物也不顺眼了。它们之前从来没有烦过我，但现在它们就像粗俗的附加物一样让我很反感。我决定问问乔，他为什么一直教我把那些图画卡片叫做“杰克”，而实际上它们应该叫“奈夫”。我多么希望乔当初得到的是更高雅的教养，那样的话我也会受到更高雅的教养。","I took the opportunity of being alone in the court-yard, to look at my coarse hands and my common boots.My opinion of those accessories was not favorable.They had never troubled me before, but they troubled me now, as vulgar appendages.I determined to ask Joe why he had ever taught me to call those picture-cards, Jacks, which ought to be called knaves.I wished Joe had been rather more genteelly brought up, and then I should have been so too."
"埃斯特拉回来了，手里拿了点面包和肉，一小杯啤酒。她把杯子放在院子里的石板上，把面包和肉塞给我，看都不看我一眼，态度蛮横无礼，就好像我是一条让人丢脸的狗一样。我感到特别难堪，特别受伤，感到如此地被冷遇，被冒犯，既生气又伤心——我找不出合适的词来描绘我的心情——天知道合适的词是什么——眼泪开始往上涌。就在眼泪要涌出来的那一刻，那个女孩看着我，眼里带着一丝快感，因为她知道是她把我弄哭的。这让我有力量把眼泪咽回去，并且回看着她。于是她很轻视地甩了一下头——但我觉得，她感觉到自己太过肯定地认为我很伤心——然后从我身边走开了。","She came back, with some bread and meat and a little mug of beer. She put the mug down on the stones of the yard, and gave me the bread and meat without looking at me, as insolently as if I were a dog in disgrace.I was so humiliated, hurt, spurned, offended, angry, sorry—I cannot hit upon the right name for the smart—God knows what its name was—that tears started to my eyes.The moment they sprang there, the girl looked at me with a quick delight in having been the cause of them.This gave me power to keep them back and to look at her: so, she gave a contemptuous toss—but with a sense, I thought, of having made too sure that I was so wounded -and left me."
"但是，当她离开之后，我四处找地方把我的脸藏起来。我躲到酿酒坊小路上的一个门后边，把手臂倚在墙上，把头靠在手臂上，大哭起来。我一边哭，一边踢墙，同时用力揪我的头发。我心里太难过了，那种莫名的痛苦太强烈了，我需要发泄出来。","But, when she was gone, I looked about me for a place to hide my face in, and got behind one of the gates in the brewery-lane, and leaned my sleeve against the wall there, and leaned my forehead on it and cried.As I cried, I kicked the wall, and took a hard twist at my hair; so bitter were my feelings, and so sharp was the smart without a name, that needed counteraction."
"我姐姐的教养让我变得很敏感。在孩子们生存的小世界里，不管是谁把他们带大的，孩子领悟最深、感受最大的就是不公正的待遇。这个孩子可能仅仅会受到一点不公正的待遇，但孩子很小，他的世界也很小，以他的衡量标准来看，他的木马和大骨架的爱尔兰猎马一样高大。在我内心当中，从儿时开始我就在与不公正的待遇做着永恒的斗争。从我会说话时起，我就知道，我姐姐那反复无常的暴力威胁对我来说是不公正的待遇。我一直抱有一个坚定的信念，那就是我姐姐虽然把我带大，但没有权利对我打打骂骂。在经受羞辱、禁食、守夜以及其他的苦行赎罪的惩罚过程中，我产生了这种坚定的信念。我孤身一人，毫无保护地与这种信念融为一体，而这在很大程度上让我变得性格胆怯、多愁善感。","My sister’s bringing up had made me sensitive.In the little world in which children have their existence whosoever brings them up, there is nothing so finely perceived and so finely felt, as injustice.It may be only small injustice that the child cans be exposed to; but the child is small, and its world is small, and its rocking-horse stands as many hands high, according to scale, as a big-boned Irish hunter.Within myself, I had sustained, from my babyhood, a perpetual conflict with injustice.I had known, from the time when I could speak, that my sister, in her capricious and violent coercion, was unjust to me.I had cherished a profound conviction that her bringing me up by hand, gave her no right to bring me up by jerks.Through all my punishments, disgraces, fasts and vigils, and other penitential performances, I had nursed this assurance; and to my communing so much with it, in a solitary and unprotected way, I in great part refer the fact that I was morally timid and very sensitive."
"我踢酿酒作坊的墙，猛揪自己的头发，这样暂时摆脱了受伤的情感。然后我用衣袖擦干脸，从门后走了出来。面包和肉的味道还可以，啤酒给我带来一阵暖意和舌头上的刺痛感。我很快就来了精神，开始四处观望。","I got rid of my injured feelings for the time, by kicking them into the brewery wall, and twisting them out of my hair, and then I smoothed my face with my sleeve, and came from behind the gate.The bread and meat were acceptable, and the beer was warming and tingling, and I was soon in spirits to look about me."
"可以肯定的是，从这里一直到酿酒作坊大院里的鸽舍都是个荒凉的地方。挂在柱子上的鸽舍已经被哪阵大风吹歪了，如果上面有鸽子的话，它们摇摇晃晃的，一定以为自己是在大海上。但是，鸽舍里没有鸽子，马厩里没有马，猪圈里没有猪，仓库里没有麦芽，大锅和大桶里没有谷物和啤酒的香气。酿酒作坊所有的用途和香气可能都已经随着它最后一股浓烟蒸发掉了。在一个侧院里，胡乱地摆放着一些空酒桶。它们散发出一股酸气，让人们想起它们过去的好时光。但是这种气味太酸了，不能被当成过去那种啤酒的样本——在这一点上，我想起那些隐士，他们和大多数人没什么两样。","To be sure, it was a deserted place, down to the pigeon-house in the brewery-yard, which had been blown crooked on its pole by some high wind, and would have made the pigeons think themselves at sea, if there had been any pigeons there to be rocked by it.But, there were no pigeons in the dove-cot, no horses in the stable, no pigs in the sty, no malt in the store-house, no smells of grains and beer in the copper or the vat.All the uses and scents of the brewery might have evaporated with its last reek of smoke.In a by-yard, there was a wilderness of empty casks, which had a certain sour remembrance of better days lingering about them; but it was too sour to be accepted as a sample of the beer that was gone—and in this respect I remember those recluses as being like most others."
"在酿酒作坊最远处的后面有一个杂草丛生的花园，周围有一道旧围墙。墙不是很高，所以我努力踮起脚，抓住墙头，仔细看了看花园。我发现这个花园就是这所房子的花园。里面杂草丛生、藤茎缠绕，但是在黄绿相间的小径上有一行足迹，似乎有人有时会从那里走过。在那时，埃斯特拉似乎已经离我越来越远了。然而她似乎是无处不在。因为，当我经不住酒桶的诱惑，开始在上面走时，我看到埃斯特拉正在院子另一头的酒桶上走着。她背对着我，两手托住她披散下来的棕色秀发，目不斜视地往前走，径直地从我视线里消失了。于是，我走进酿酒作坊——我是指那个又高又大、铺着地板的地方。人们曾经在这里酿啤酒，现在这里仍然有酿酒器皿。当我刚进去的时候，里面的黑暗让我感到相当压抑。我站在门口，向周围看了看。我看到她经过几个熄灭的火炉，走上几个轻便铁阶梯，然后从位于我头顶高处的一条长廊走了出去，仿佛她要上天似的。","Behind the furthest end of the brewery, was a rank garden with an old wall: not so high but that I could struggle up and hold on long enough to look over it, and see that the rank garden was the garden of the house, and that it was overgrown with tangled weeds, but that there was a track upon the green and yellow paths, as if someone sometimes walked there, and that Estella was walking away from me even then.But she seemed to be everywhere.For, when I yielded to the temptation presented by the casks, and began to walk on them.I saw her walking on them at the end of the yard of casks. She had her back towards me, and held her pretty brown hair spread out in her two hands, and never looked round, and passed out of my view directly.So, in the brewery itself—by which I mean the large paved lofty place in which they used to make the beer, and where the brewing utensils still were.When I first went into it, and, rather oppressed by its gloom, stood near the door looking about me, I saw her pass among the extinguished fires, and ascend some light iron stairs, and go out by a gallery high overhead, as if she were going out into the sky."
"就在那里，就在那一刻，一件奇怪的事发生了，让我大为震惊。这件事我当时觉得奇怪，很久之后想起来觉得更奇怪了。我抬头向上看，刺眼的光让我的视线有点模糊。我把目光投向靠近我右手边的那个低矮的房屋角落，看到那儿有个大的木头横梁。横梁上吊着一个人，绳索系在脖子上。这个人穿着一身发黄的白衣服，脚上只穿了一只鞋。她吊在那里，我可以看到她衣服上褪色的花饰就像土黄色的纸一样。那张面孔是郝维仙小姐的模样，整张脸动了一下，仿佛她想要叫我一样。看到这个人，我十分恐惧，而我确定片刻之前她并不在那里，这也让我恐惧。所以我刚开始是扭头从她那边跑开，然后又掉头朝她那边跑去。然而当我发现那里根本没有人时，我内心的恐惧前所未有地强烈。","It was in this place, and at this moment, that a strange thing happened to my fancy.I thought it a strange thing then, and I thought it a stranger thing long afterwards.I turned my eyes—a little dimmed by looking up at the frosty light—towards a great wooden beam in a low nook of the building near me on my right hand, and I saw a figure hanging there by the neck.A figure all in yellow white, with but one shoe to the feet; and it hung so, that I could see that the faded trimmings of the dress were like earthy paper, and that the face was Miss Havisham’s, with a movement going over the whole countenance as if she were trying to call to me.In the terror of seeing the figure and in the terror of being certain that it had not been there a moment before, I at first ran from it, and then ran towards it.And my terror was greatest of all, when I found no figure there."
"随后，我看到晴空刺眼的阳光，看到人们从院落大门的铁栏外经过。余下的面包，肉和啤酒也让我清醒些了，没有什么能比这些更快地让我恢复过来了。但是如果不是我看到埃斯特拉拿着钥匙走过来、放我出去的话，即使有那些的东西的帮助，我可能也不能这么快就恢复过来。我寻思着，要是她看见我受到惊吓的样子，她就有足够的理由鄙视我了，而我是不会让她有足够理由的。","Nothing less than the frosty light of the cheerful sky, the sight of people passing beyond the bars of the court-yard gate, and the reviving influence of the rest of the bread and meat and beer, would have brought me round.Even with those aids, I might not have come to myself as soon as I did, but that I saw Estella approaching with the keys, to let me out.She would have some fair reason for looking down upon me, I thought, if she saw me frightened; and she would have no fair reason."
"她经过我的时候，耀武扬威地瞥了我一眼，仿佛她特别欣喜地看到我的双手如此粗糙，我的靴子如此笨重。她打开大门，手把着门站在那里。我走了出去，一眼也没有看她。这时她用手嘲弄地碰了我一下。","She gave me a triumphant glance in passing me, as if she rejoiced that my hands were so coarse and my boots were so thick, and she opened the gate, and stood holding it.I was passing out without looking at her, when she touched me with a taunting hand."
"“你为什么不哭？”","“Why don’t you cry?”"
"“因为我不想哭。”","“Because I don’t want to.”"
"“你想哭。”她说道，“你刚刚一直在哭，眼睛都快哭瞎了，现在你又快要哭了。”","“You do,” said she.“You have been crying till you are half blind, and you are near crying again now.”"
"她轻蔑地大笑起来，把我推出去，锁上了大门。我径直去了彭波契克先生家里，发现他不在家后，我感到如释重负。于是，我让店员告知彭波契克先生，郝维仙小姐要我哪一天再到她家里去。之后我就开始往我们的铁匠铺走去，这段路有四英里长。我一边走一边思考我所看到的一切，同时深切地意识到，我只是个干苦力活的小子；我的双手粗糙，靴子笨重；我养成了一个把“奈夫”叫做“杰克”的粗鄙的习惯；我比昨天晚上所了解的自己更加无知；总体来讲，我是以一种糟糕的方式卑下地活着。","She laughed contemptuously, pushed me out, and locked the gate upon me.I went straight to Mr. Pumblechook’s, and was immensely relieved to find him not at home.So, leaving word with the shop man on what day I was wanted at Miss Havisham’s again, I set off on the four-mile walk to our forge; pondering, as I went along, on all I had seen, and deeply revolving that I was a common laboring-boy; that my hands were coarse; that my boots were thick; that I had fallen into a despicable habit of calling knaves Jacks; that I was much more ignorant than I had considered myself last night, and generally that I was in a low-lived bad way."
"第九章","Chapter 9"
"当我到家之后，我姐姐对郝维仙小姐家的一切都非常好奇，她问了我很多问题。很快，我的后脖颈和后腰上就挨了重重的拳头，脸也很不光彩地被按在厨房的墙上，这都是因为我没能仔细地回答问题。","When I reached home, my sister was very curious to know all about Miss Havisham’s, and asked a number of questions.And I soon found myself getting heavily bumped from behind in the nape of the neck and the small of the back, and having my face ignominiously shoved against the kitchen wall, because I did not answer those questions at sufficient length."
"如果任何一个年轻人和我一样在心里担心自己说出的话不会被别人所理解的话——我认为这是可能的，因为我没有什么特别的理由怀疑自己是个怪物——很多事情就会因此被留在心里。我很确定，如果我像亲眼所见的那样描述郝维仙小姐家的话，他们一定不会理解我。不仅如此，我还确信，郝维仙小姐也不会被理解，尽管我对她也是一点也不了解。我寻思着，要是我把她的真实情况一一摆出来（根本不提埃斯特拉）让乔太太去思考的话，那样就有些卑鄙和阴险了。于是我尽可能地少说，所以我的脸就被按在了厨房的墙壁上。","If a dread of not being understood be hidden in the breasts of other young people to anything like the extent to which it used to be hidden in mine—which I consider probable, as I have no particular reason to suspect myself of having been a monstrosity—it is the key to many reservations.I felt convinced that if I described Miss Havisham’s as my eyes had seen it, I should not be understood.Not only that, but I felt convinced that Miss Havisham too would not be understood; and although she was perfectly incomprehensible to me, I entertained an impression that there would be something coarse and treacherous in my dragging her as she really was (to say nothing of Miss Estella) before the contemplation of Mrs. Joe.Consequently, I said as little as I could, and had my face shoved against the kitchen wall."
"最糟糕的是，那个欺负人的老彭波契克，在强烈的好奇心驱使之下，想要知道我一切的所见所闻。他在喝下午茶的时候坐着他的轻便马车气喘吁吁地赶来，要我把所有的细节都透露给他。他滑溜溜的眼睛睁得老大，嘴巴张开，浅棕色的头发好问地竖起来，他的背心被枯燥的算数题装得鼓鼓的。一看到他这副受折磨的样子，我就故意沉默不语。","The worst of it was that that bullying old Pumblechook, preyed upon by a devouring curiosity to be informed of all I had seen and heard, came gaping over in his chaise-cart at tea-time, to have the details divulged to him.And the mere sight of the torment, with his fishy eyes and mouth open, his sandy hair inquisitively on end, and his waistcoat heaving with windy arithmetic, made me vicious in my reticence."
"“好了，小子。”彭波契克舅舅在火炉旁的贵宾椅上刚一坐定就开始发问，“你在镇上过得怎么样啊？”","“Well, boy,” Uncle Pumblechook began, as soon as he was seated in the chair of honor by the fire.“How did you get on up town?”"
"我回答道：“挺好的，先生。”这时我姐姐朝我挥了挥拳头。","I answered, “Pretty well, sir,” and my sister shook her fist at me."
"“挺好的？”彭波契克先生重复道，“‘挺好的’根本就是没有回答。告诉我们‘挺好的’是什么意思，小子？”","“Pretty well?” Mr. Pumblechook repeated.“Pretty well is no answer.Tell us what you mean by pretty well, boy?”"
"可能脑门上粘的石灰粉会让脑袋僵硬，进入顽固的状态。不管怎样，我的脑门粘上墙上的石灰粉，我也就变得非常顽固。我想了一会儿，然后就像发现了什么新鲜事一样地回答道：“我的意思是挺好的。”","Whitewash on the forehead hardens the brain into a state of obstinacy perhaps.Anyhow, with whitewash from the wall on my forehead, my obstinacy was adamantine.I reflected for some time, and then answered as if I had discovered a new idea, “I mean pretty well.”"
"我姐姐不耐烦地喊了一声，正准备朝我扑过来——我没有任何防御措施，因为乔此时正在铁匠铺里忙活着。而这时，彭波契克舅舅插了进来，他说：“别！别发火。让我来对付这小子，太太，让我来对付这小子。”彭波契克先生把我转过来面对着他，就像他要给我理发一样。他说：","My sister with an exclamation of impatience was going to fly at me—I had no shadow of defence, for Joe was busy in the forge when Mr. Pumblechook interposed with “No!Don’t lose your temper.Leave this lad to me, ma’am; leave this lad to me.”Mr. Pumblechook then turned me towards him, as if he were going to cut my hair, and said:"
"“首先我们整理一下思绪：四十三便士是多少？”","“First to get our thoughts in order: Forty-three pence?”"
"我寻思着，要是我回答“四百镑”会有什么后果，结果发现这种后果对我不利，于是我就尽可能地算得准确些，结果回答得比正确答案大约少了八便士。然后彭波契克先生让我复习一遍便士换算，从“十二便士等于一先令”到“四十便士等于三先令四便士”。接着他就像已经替我算好了一样，得意洋洋地问道：“现在可以了！四十三便士是多少？”我思考了很长时间之后回答道：“我不知道。”我当时特别恼火，我甚至怀疑自己是不是真的知道。","I calculated the consequences of replying “Four Hundred Pound,” and finding them against me, went as near the answer as I could—which was somewhere about eightpence off.Mr. Pumblechook then put me through my pence-table from “twelve pence make one shilling,” up to “forty pence make three and fourpence,” and then triumphantly demanded, as if he had done for me, “Now!How much is forty-three pence?”To which I replied, after a long interval of reflection, “I don’t know.”And I was so aggravated that I almost doubt if I did know."
"彭波契克先生的脑袋就像螺丝钉一样开动起来，要从我身上钻出答案：“比如，四十三便士是不是七先令六便士三法寻呢？”","Mr. Pumblechook worked his head like a screw to screw it out of me, and said, “Is forty-three pence seven and sixpence three fardens, for instance?”"
"“对！”我说道。尽管我姐姐立马打了我几个耳光，但我还是很满足地看到我的回答搞砸了他的玩笑，把他逼到了死胡同。","“Yes!” said I. And although my sister instantly boxed my ears, it was highly gratifying to me to see that the answer spoilt his joke, and brought him to a dead stop."
"“小子！郝维仙小姐长什么样子？”彭波契克先生恢复过来之后又开始发问，他把胳膊紧紧地抱在胸前，同时拧螺丝般地转动着脑袋。","“Boy!What like is Miss Havisham?”Mr. Pumblechook began again when he had recovered; folding his arms tight on his chest and applying the screw."
"“很高很黑。”我告诉他。","“Very tall and dark,” I told him."
"“她真是这样的吗，舅舅？”我姐姐问道。","“Is she, uncle?” asked my sister."
"彭波契克先生眨了眨眼睛表示同意，我马上从这一点上推断出，他从没见过郝维仙小姐，因为她根本就不是那样的。","Mr. Pumblechook winked assent; from which I at once inferred that he had never seen Miss Havisham, for she was nothing of the kind."
"“好！”彭波契克先生自负地说道，（“这就是对付他的方法！我觉得我们开始能顶住他的反抗了，太太。”）","“Good!” said Mr. Pumblechook conceitedly.(“This is the way to have him!We are beginning to hold our own, I think, Mum?”)"
"“那是肯定的，舅舅。”乔太太回答说，“我希望你一直能管教着他，你特别清楚怎么样对付他。”","“I am sure, uncle,” returned Mrs. Joe, “I wish you had him always: you know so well how to deal with him.”"
"“好了，小子！你今天去的时候她正在干什么？”彭波契克先生问道。","“Now, boy!What was she a-doing of, when you went in today?” asked Mr. Pumblechook."
"“她正坐着。”我回答说，“坐在一辆黑天鹅绒的马车里。”","“She was sitting,” I answered, “in a black velvet coach.”"
"彭波契克先生和乔太太面面相觑——这是理所当然的——他们两人同时重复道：“坐在一辆黑色天鹅绒的马车里？”","Mr. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe stared at one another—as they well might—and both repeated,“In a black velvet coach?”"
"“是的。”我说道，“埃斯特拉小姐——我想是她的侄女——用金盘子盛着蛋糕和酒，从马车窗户递给她。而且我们都拿到了放在金盘子上的蛋糕和酒。我上了马车，坐在后面吃我的那份，因为她叫我上去的。”","“Yes,” said I.“And Miss Estella—that’s her niece, I think—handed her in cake and wine at the coach-window, on a gold plate.And we all had cake and wine on gold plates.And I got up behind the coach to eat mine, because she told me to.”"
"“那里还有其他人吗？”彭波契克先生问道。","“Was anybody else there?” asked Mr. Pumblechook."
"“有四条狗。”我说道。","“Four dogs,” said I."
"“大狗还是小狗？”","“Large or small?”"
"“特别大。”我说道，“他们争抢着放在银筐子里的小牛排。”","“Immense,” said I.“And they fought for veal cutlets out of a silver basket.”"
"彭波契克先生和乔太太又面面相觑，惊奇得不得了。我完全发狂了——就像一个在酷刑之下不顾后果的证人——我什么话都能对他们说出来。","Mr. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe stared at one another again, in utter amazement.I was perfectly frantic—a reckless witness under the torture—and would have told them anything."
"“天哪，这辆马车在哪里？”我姐姐问道。","“Where was this coach, in the name of gracious?” asked my sister."
"“在郝维仙小姐的房间里。”他们又面面相觑。“但是车前一匹马也没有。”我本来大胆地想象了一下，想说有四匹配有华丽马具的马匹，但最后一刻我否决了这个想法，改成了这个保守的说法。","“In Miss Havisham’s room.”They stared again.“But there weren’t any horses to it.”I added this saving clause, in the moment of rejecting four richly caparisoned coursers which I had had wild thoughts of harnessing."
"“这可能吗，舅舅？”乔太太问道，“这小子是什么意思？”","“Can this be possible, uncle?” asked Mrs. Joe.“What can the boy mean?”"
"“我来告诉你，太太。”彭波契克先生说，“我看，那是台轿子。她反复无常，你知道——非常反复无常——反复无常到在轿子里过日子。”","“I’ll tell you, Mum,” said Mr. Pumblechook.“My opinion is, it’s a sedan-chair.She’s flighty, you know—very flighty—quite flighty enough to pass her days in a sedan-chair.”"
"“你有见过她坐在轿子里吗，舅舅？”乔太太问。","“Did you ever see her in it, uncle?” asked Mrs. Joe."
"“我哪能见过。”他不得不承认地回答道，“我一辈子都没见过她。从没亲眼见过她！”","“How could I,” he returned, forced to the admission, “when I never see her in my life?Never clapped eyes upon her!”"
"“天哪，舅舅！那你过去是怎么和她说话的？”","“Goodness, uncle!And yet you have spoken to her?”"
"“哎呀，你不知道。”彭波契克先生不耐烦地说道，“我去那里的时候都被带到她的门外，门稍微开了一点，她就那样跟我说话。别说你不知道这事，太太。不管怎样，这个小子进去玩了。你玩了什么，小子？”","“Why, don’t you know,” said Mr. Pumblechook, testily, “that when I have been there, I have been took up to the outside of her door, and the door has stood ajar, and she has spoke to me that way.Don’t say you don’t know that, Mum.Howsever, the boy went there to play.What did you play at, boy?”"
"“我们玩旗。”我说道。（我不得不说，当我回想起当时我撒的谎时，我都对我自己感到吃惊。）","“We played with flags,” I said.(I beg to observe that I think of myself with amazement, when I recall the lies I told on this occasion.)"
"“旗！”我姐姐重复道。","“Flags!” echoed my sister."
"“是啊。”我说，“埃斯特拉朝马车窗外挥舞着蓝旗，我挥舞着红旗，郝维仙小姐挥舞着一面洒满小金星的旗。然后我们都挥剑欢呼。”","“Yes,” said I.“Estella waved a blue flag, and I waved a red one, and Miss Havisham waved one sprinkled all over with little gold stars, out at the coach-window.And then we all waved our swords and hurrahed.”"
"“剑！”我姐姐重复道，“你们哪里来的剑？”","“Swords!” repeated my sister.“Where did you get swords from?”"
"“从碗橱里拿的。”我说，“而且我看见里面有枪——果酱——药丸。房间里没有阳光，但用蜡烛点亮了。”","“Out of a cupboard,” said I.“And I saw pistols in it—and jam—and pills.And there was no daylight in the room, but it was all lighted up with candles.”"
"“那是真的，夫人。”彭波契克先生说着严肃地点了一下头。“事情就是这样的，我看到的就是这些。”然后他们两个都盯着我，而我则做出一副明显的、老老实实的样子，看着他们，同时用右手拧着右裤腿。","“That’s true, Mum,” said Mr. Pumblechook, with a grave nod.“That’s the state of the case, for that much I’ve seen myself.”And then they both stared at me, and I, with an obtrusive show of artlessness on my countenance, stared at them, and plaited the right leg of my trousers with my right hand."
"要是他们再多问我一个问题，我肯定就会露馅。因为当时我正准备说院子里有个气球，这种说法一定会让我整个陈述遭到被怀疑的危险。我之所以没说是因为我不确定是凭空捏造出个气球好，还是瞎编说酿酒作坊里有只熊好。但是他们俩全神贯注地讨论我给他们讲述的奇事，所以我才得以逃脱。当乔从铁匠铺回来喝杯茶的时候，他们还在讨论这个话题。我姐姐把我瞎编的经历告诉了乔，她这么做更多的是为了减轻她自己的精神负担，而不是为了让乔高兴。","If they had asked me any more questions I should undoubtedly have betrayed myself, for I was even then on the point of mentioning that there was a balloon in the yard, and should have hazarded the statement but for my invention being divided between that phenomenon and a bear in the brewery.They were so much occupied, however, in discussing the marvels I had already presented for their consideration, that I escaped.The subject still held them when Joe came in from his work to have a cup of tea.To whom my sister, more for the relief of her own mind than for the gratification of his, related my pretended experiences."
"现在，当我看见乔睁着蓝色的大眼睛，满厨房地观望，一脸极为惊讶的表情。我心里立刻充满了懊悔。但这种懊悔仅仅是对乔一个人的懊悔——对另外两个人一点也没有悔意。对于乔，也仅仅是对于乔来说，我认为自己是个小魔头。而这时他们正坐在那里争论着，我结识了郝维仙小姐并且得到她的恩惠之后会有什么结果。他们毫无疑问地认为郝维仙小姐会“为我做些什么事”，他们有疑问的是这些事会以什么方式来做成。我姐姐坚持要“财产”。彭波契克先生希望是一笔数目可观的费用，使我能够进入某种上等的行业当学徒——比如说，谷物和种子买卖行业。乔提出了一个很好的建议说，我可能只会得到一只争抢过小牛排的狗。但乔因此被他们两个人狠狠地羞辱了一番。“要是你那个傻瓜脑袋想不出比这更好的建议，”我姐姐说道，“或者你还有活要干的话，你最好滚开干活去。”于是乔就离开了。","Now, when I saw Joe open his blue eyes and roll them all round the kitchen in helpless amazement, I was overtaken by penitence; but only as regarded him—not in the least as regarded the other two.Towards Joe, and Joe only, I considered myself a young monster, while they sat debating what results would come to me from Miss Havisham’s acquaintance and favor.They had no doubt that Miss Havisham would “do something” for me; their doubts related to the form that something would take.My sister stood out for “property.”Mr. Pumblechook was in favor of a handsome premium for binding me apprentice to some genteel trade—say, the corn and seed trade, for instance.Joe fell into the deepest disgrace with both, for offering the bright suggestion that I might only be presented with one of the dogs who had fought for the veal-cutlets.“If a fool’s head can’t express better opinions than that,” said my sister, “and you have got any work to do, you had better go and do it.”So he went."
"彭波契克先生驱车离开之后，趁我姐姐正在洗洗涮涮，我溜到铁匠铺去找乔。我在那里一直等到他把晚上的活干完。然后我说：“在炉火熄灭之前，乔，我想告诉你一点事情。”","After Mr. Pumblechook had driven off, and when my sister was washing up, I stole into the forge to Joe, and remained by him until he had done for the night.Then I said, “Before the fire goes out, Joe, I should like to tell you something.”"
"“你想告诉我一点事情，皮普？”乔说着把他的钉蹄凳拖到熔炉旁边。“那就说吧。什么事，皮普？”","“Should you, Pip?” said Joe, drawing his shoeing-stool near the forge.“Then tell us.What is it, Pip?”"
"“乔,”我一边说着，一边抓起他卷起的衣袖，在拇指和食指间不停地揉搓着，“你还记得我说的关于郝维仙小姐的事吗？”","“Joe,” said I, taking hold of his rolled-up shirt sleeve, and twisting it between my finger and thumb, “you remember all that about Miss Havisham’s?”"
"“记得？”乔说,“我相信你！太妙了！”","“Remember?” said Joe.“I believe you!Wonderful!”"
"“太糟糕了，乔，那是假的。”","“It’s a terrible thing, Joe; it ain’t true.”"
"“你在说什么，皮普？”乔喊道，他大吃一惊，向后倒退了一步。“你不会是说刚刚的话是——”","“What are you telling of, Pip?” cried Joe, falling back in the greatest amazement.“You don’t mean to say it’s—”"
"“是的，是些谎话，乔。”","“Yes I do; it’s lies, Joe.”"
"“但不会都是谎话吧？只是没有黑天鹅绒马车，是吧，皮普？”我站在那里摇了摇头。“但至少有狗吧，皮普？拜托，皮普，”乔用说服的口气说道，“即使没有小牛排，至少有狗吧？”","“But not all of it?Why sure you don’t mean to say, Pip, that there was no black welwet coach?”For, I stood shaking my head.“But at least there was dogs, Pip?Come, Pip,” said Joe, persuasively, “if there warn’t no weal-cutlets, at least there was dogs?”"
"“没有，乔。”","“No, Joe.”"
"“一只也没有？”乔说道，“一只小狗仔都没有？拜托？”","“A dog?” said Joe. “A puppy?Come?”"
"“没有，乔，什么狗也没有。”","“No, Joe, there was nothing at all of the kind.”"
"当我无望地盯着乔时，乔也失望地注视着我。“皮普，老弟！这可不行啊，老弟！我说！你想今后变成什么样的人啊？”","As I fixed my eyes hopelessly on Joe, Joe contemplated me in dismay.“Pip, old chap!This won’t do, old fellow!I say!Where do you expect to go to?”"
"“很糟糕，乔，是不是？”","“It’s terrible, Joe; an’t it?”"
"“很糟糕？”乔喊道，“太糟糕了！你中什么邪了？”","“Terrible?” cried Joe. “Awful!What possessed you?”"
"“我不知道自己中了什么邪，乔。”我放开他的衣袖，坐在他脚边的煤灰里，耷拉着头回答道，“但我真希望你没教过我把卡片上的奈夫叫做杰克，我真希望我的靴子不是这么笨重，我的手不是这么粗糙。","“I don’t know what possessed me, Joe,” I replied, letting his shirt sleeve go, and sitting down in the ashes at his feet, hanging my head; “but I wish you hadn’t taught me to call Knaves at cards, Jacks; and I wish my boots weren’t so thick nor my hands so coarse.”"
"然后我告诉乔，我心里很难过，我不能跟乔太太和彭波契克先生解释清楚我的意思，他们对我太粗暴了。我告诉他，在郝维仙家里有个漂亮的年轻小姐，她极其高傲。这个小姐说我很普通，我知道我很普通，我希望自己不是这样普普通通，所以不知怎么的就说了谎，尽管我不知道谎话是如何说出口的。","And then I told Joe that I felt very miserable, and that I hadn’t been able to explain myself to Mrs. Joe and Pumblechook who were so rude to me, and that there had been a beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham’s who was dreadfully proud, and that she had said I was common, and that I knew I was common, and that I wished I was not common, and that the lies had come of it somehow, though I didn’t know how."
"这是个形而上学的问题，至少对乔和我来说都很难解决。但是乔把这个问题一股脑地剥离了形而上学的领域，这样一来，反而解决了这个问题。","This was a case of metaphysics, at least as difficult for Joe to deal with, as for me.But Joe took the case altogether out of the region of metaphysics, and by that means vanquished it."
"“有一件事你可能很确定，皮普。”乔沉思了一会说道，“那就是，谎话就是谎话。不管是怎么说出来的，都不应该说出来，它们来自于谎话，也会接着产生其他的谎话。别再说谎了，皮普。说谎不是让你摆脱普通的方法，老弟。而且，至于‘很普通’，我不是很明白。你在有些方面是不普通的。你个头很小，这点不普通。而且你是个学问家，这点也不普通。”","“There’s one thing you may be sure of, Pip,” said Joe, after some rumination, “namely, that lies is lies.Howsever they come, they didn’t ought to come, and they come from the father of lies, and work round to the same.Don’t you tell no more of ’em, Pip.That ain’t the way to get out of being common, old chap.And as to being common, I don’t make it out at all clear.You are oncommon in some things.You’re oncommon small.Likewise you’re a oncommon scholar.”"
"“不，我很无知，很迟钝，乔。”","“No, I am ignorant and backward, Joe.”"
"“怎么这么说呢，看看你昨晚上写得那封信！甚至用印刷体写的！我见过很多信——哈！还是那些上流人士写的信！——我发誓，它们都不是用印刷体写的。”乔说道。","“Why, see what a letter you wrote last night!Wrote in print even!I’ve seen letters—Ah! and from gentlefolks!—that I’ll swear weren’t wrote in print,” said Joe."
"“我几乎什么都没学到，乔。你把我想得太好了。只是这样而已。”","“I have learnt next to nothing, Joe.You think much of me.It’s only that.”"
"“好吧，皮普，”乔说道，“不管是不是这样，在你成为一个不寻常的学者之前，你必须成为一个普通的学者，我就希望这样！国王要是在他还是个没有继位的王子时期，没有从学习字母表开始的话，他就不能头戴王冠，坐在宝座上，用印刷体书写他的国会法令——哈！”乔意味深长地甩了一下头，补充道：“而且字母表要从A学起来，一直学到Z。尽管我不能说我就是这么做的，但我知道应该怎么做。”","“Well, Pip,” said Joe, “be it so or be it son’t, you must be a common scholar afore you can be a oncommon one, I should hope!The king upon his throne, with his crown upon his ’ed, can’t sit and write his acts of Parliament in print, without having begun, when he were a unpromoted Prince, with the alphabet—Ah!” added Joe, with a shake of the head that was full of meaning, “and begun at A too, and worked his way to Z.And I know what that is to do, though I can’t say I’ve exactly done it.”"
"这番睿智的话中透出的一线希望让我大受鼓舞。","There was some hope in this piece of wisdom, and it rather encouraged me."
"“至于那些干活、赚钱的普通人，”乔若有所思地继续说道，“最好还是继续与普通人交往，不要与不寻常的人打交道——这倒让我想起来了，我希望真有旗子游戏吧，是吧？”","“Whether common ones as to callings and earnings,” pursued Joe, reflectively, “mightn’t be the better of continuing for a keep company with common ones, instead of going out to play with oncommon ones—which reminds me to hope that there were a flag, perhaps?”"
"“没有，乔。”","“No, Joe.”"
"“我很遗憾没有旗子游戏，皮普。不管有没有，现在都不能再追究了，因为你姐姐一定会大发雷霆的。别再想这件事了，你也不是有意这样做的。听着，皮普，听着你这个真心朋友对你说的话。对你来说，这也是一个真心朋友应该说的话。要是你不能通过正途变得不寻常的话，你就永远不能通过歪门邪道变得不寻常。所以别再说谎了，皮普，好好活着，死了也高兴。”","“I’m sorry there weren’t a flag, Pip.Whether that might be, or mightn’t be, is a thing as can’t be looked into now, without putting your sister on the Rampage; and that’s a thing not to be thought of, as being done intentional.Lookee here, Pip, at what is said to you by a true friend.Which this to you the true friend say.If you can’t get to be oncommon through going straight, you’ll never get to do it through going crooked.So don’t tell no more on ’em, Pip, and live well and die happy.”"
"“你不生我的气吗，乔？”","“You are not angry with me, Joe?”"
"“不生气，老弟。但是记住，我认为你说的那些谎话太过分，太让人震惊了——比如小牛排以及一群狗打架的谎话——只有真心对你好的人才会劝告你。皮普，你上楼睡觉的时候要好好想想。就这些了，老弟，再也别说谎了。”","“No, old chap.But bearing in mind that them were which I meantersay of a stunning and outdacious sort—alluding to them which bordered on weal-cutlets and dog-fighting—a sincere wellwisher would adwise, Pip, their being dropped into your meditations, when you go up-stairs to bed.That’s all, old chap, and don’t never do it no more.”"
"在我上楼进了我的小房间并做完祷告之后，我没有忘记乔的劝导。但我年幼的思维一片混乱，很不愉快。我躺下之后久久不能入睡，我寻思着，埃斯特拉一定会认为乔仅仅是个铁匠，多么普通啊，会觉得他的靴子多么笨重，他的双手多么粗糙啊。我寻思着，乔和我姐姐那时还坐在厨房里，我也是从厨房出来后到床上去睡觉的。但郝维仙小姐和埃斯特拉从来不坐在厨房里，她们的行为比这些普通的行为上等多了。我睡着了，睡梦之中又忆起我在郝维仙小姐家的所作所为，仿佛我在那里呆了几个星期甚至是几个月，而不是几个小时，也仿佛那已经是一件陈年往事了，而不是当天发生的事。","When I got up to my little room and said my prayers, I did not forget Joe’s recommendation, and yet my young mind was in that disturbed and unthankful state, that I thought long after I laid me down, how common Estella would consider Joe, a mere blacksmith: how thick his boots, and how coarse his hands.I thought how Joe and my sister were then sitting in the kitchen, and how I had come up to bed from the kitchen, and how Miss Havisham and Estella never sat in a kitchen, but were far above the level of such common doings.I fell asleep recalling what I “used to do” when I was at Miss Havisham’s; as though I had been there weeks or months, instead of hours; and as though it were quite an old subject of remembrance, instead of one that had arisen only that day."
"那天对我来说是值得纪念的一天，因为这一天让我发生了很大的改变。但是，任何生命轨迹都是这样的。想象某个特定的日子突然变得与众不同，然后就会寻思，整个生命过程原来可以和现在的如此不同。读者您不妨停下来思考一下，生活就是一条长长的链条。不论是铁链、金链、荆棘环还是花环，如果没有这值得纪念的一天做成的第一环，你就永远不能经历这样的生活。","That was a memorable day to me, for it made great changes in me.But, it is the same with any life.Imagine one selected day struck out of it, and think how different its course would have been.Pause you who read this, and think for a moment of the long chain of iron or gold, of thorns or flowers, that would never have bound you, but for the formation of the first link on one memorable day."
"第十章","Chapter 10"
"一两天之后的一个清晨，我醒来时产生了一个绝妙的念头，那就是要让自己走向不寻常，最好的一步就是学会比迪所知道的一切。为了实现这一光辉的设想，我晚上来到沃甫赛先生姑婆的家里对比迪说，我心怀着一种特别的理由，想在自己的一生当中有所成就，如果她能将其所有的学识传授给我，我一定会对她感激不尽。比迪是个非常热情的女孩子，她当即表示愿意，并且事实上，她在五分钟之后就开始履行她的承诺了。","The felicitous idea occurred to me a morning or two later when I woke, that the best step I could take towards making myself uncommon was to get out of Biddy everything she knew.In pursuance of this luminous conception I mentioned to Biddy when I went to Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt’s at night, that I had a particular reason for wishing to get on in life, and that I should feel very much obliged to her if she would impart all her learning to me.Biddy, who was the most obliging of girls, immediately said she would, and indeed began to carry out her promise within five minutes."
"由沃甫赛先生的姑婆制定出来的教育计划或者叫做课程计划可以分解成以下概要。学生们吃着苹果，往彼此的后背上扔稻草，直到沃甫赛先生的姑婆恢复了精力，手拿一根桦木棍，胡乱地挥动着，蹒跚地向他们走来。面对她来势汹汹的进攻，学生们先是轻蔑地做着鬼脸，然后站成一排，叽叽喳喳地把一本破烂的书从一个人的手里传到另一个人的手里。书里有张字母表、一些数字和表格以及一些单词拼写——更确切地说，这些是书里以前有的东西，现在已经弄丢了。这本书一开始传递，沃甫赛先生的姑婆就陷入了一种昏迷的状态，这要么是因为想睡觉了，要么是因为风湿病突然发作。学生们这时就自发地开始了一场对靴子的考查比赛，看看谁的靴子踩在别人的脚趾上最痛。这个心理练习一直持续到比迪朝他们冲过来才停止。比迪把三本破旧的圣经分发下去（形状看上去就像是从什么东西的屁股上乱砍下来的），印刷的字迹比我曾见过的任何文学珍品都难以辨认，上面满是墨水迹斑点，而且页面之间夹着各种各样被压扁的昆虫标本。这部分的教育课程通常由于比迪和执拗的学生之间的几次单打独斗而精彩起来。当打斗结束之后，比迪宣布页码，然后我们都大声读出我们会读的——或者我们不会读的——声音合起来令人惊恐。比迪用刺耳、单调的声音高声领读，我们没有人知道自己正在读什么，对我们所读的也毫无敬畏之情。这种可怕的嘈杂声持续了一段时间，不知不觉中吵醒了沃甫赛先生的姑婆。她摇摇晃晃地随便走到一个男孩子面前，揪起他的耳朵。这一举动在我们看来就意味着晚上的学习课程结束了，我们带着学术上的胜利，尖叫着跑到户外。公平地说，如果任何学生想要从石板或者甚至是墨水（如果有的话）中寻找乐趣的话，是不会被禁止的，但是在冬季里进行这样的学习是不容易的。因为上课的那个小杂货铺——这也是沃甫赛先生姑婆的起居室和卧室——只是由一根烛光暗淡的蜡烛在微微照明，而且没有剪烛火的剪刀。","The Educational scheme or Course established by Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt may be resolved into the following synopsis.The pupils ate apples and put straws down one another’s backs, until Mr Wopsle’s great-aunt collected her energies, and made an indiscriminate totter at them with a birch-rod.After receiving the charge with every mark of derision, the pupils formed in line and buzzingly passed a ragged book from hand to hand.The book had an alphabet in it, some figures and tables, and a little spelling—that is to say, it had had once.As soon as this volume began to circulate, Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt fell into a state of coma; arising either from sleep or a rheumatic paroxysm.The pupils then entered among themselves upon a competitive examination on the subject of Boots, with the view of ascertaining who could tread the hardest upon whose toes.This mental exercise lasted until Biddy made a rush at them and distributed three defaced Bibles (shaped as if they had been unskillfully cut off the chump-end of something), more illegibly printed at the best than any curiosities of literature I have since met with, speckled all over with ironmould, and having various specimens of the insect world smashed between their leaves.This part of the Course was usually lightened by several single combats between Biddy and refractory students.When the fights were over, Biddy gave out the number of a page, and then we all read aloud what we could—or what we couldn’t—in a frightful chorus; Biddy leading with a high shrill monotonous voice, and none of us having the least notion of, or reverence for, what we were reading about.When this horrible din had lasted a certain time, it mechanically awoke Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt, who staggered at a boy fortuitously, and pulled his ears.This was understood to terminate the Course for the evening, and we emerged into the air with shrieks of intellectual victory.It is fair to remark that there was no prohibition against any pupil’s entertaining himself with a slate or even with the ink (when there was any), but that it was not easy to pursue that branch of study in the winter season, on account of the little general shop in which the classes were holden—and which was also Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt’s sitting-room and bed-chamber—being but faintly illuminated through the agency of one low-spirited dip-candle and no snuffers."
"我觉得，在这种情况下，要变得不寻常是要花费时间的。尽管如此，我还是决心要尝试一下。那天晚上，比迪就开始履行我们的特殊约定。她把她那本小价格目录中绵糖一栏下的信息教给我。她还借给我一个大大的古体英文字母D让我回家临摹，这是她从某张报纸的标题上印下来的。在她告诉我这是个什么之前，我一直以为它是个钮扣的设计图案。","It appeared to me that it would take time, to become uncommon under these circumstances: nevertheless, I resolved to try it, and that very evening Biddy entered on our special agreement, by imparting some information from her little catalogue of Prices, under the head of moist sugar, and lending me, to copy at home, a large old English D which she had imitated from the heading of some newspaper, and which I supposed, until she told me what it was, to be a design for a buckle."
"当然，村子里也有个酒馆，乔自然也喜欢有时去那里抽烟斗。那天晚上我接到我姐姐的严格命令，要我在放学回家的路上到“三个快活船员”酒馆里叫上乔，把他带回家，否则一切后果由我自己承担。因此，我大步流星地朝“三个快活船员”酒馆奔去。","Of course there was a public-house in the village, and of course Joe liked sometimes to smoke his pipe there.I had received strict orders from my sister to call for him at the Three Jolly Bargemen, that evening, on my way from school, and bring him home at my peril.To the Three Jolly Bargemen, therefore, I directed my steps."
"“三个快活船员”酒馆里有个吧台，靠门一边的墙上用白垩记下一长串的赊账记录。在我看来，这些帐永远都还不清。自我记事起，它们就在这里了，而且比我的个头长得还快。但是，在我们村子周围有大量的白垩，也许人们不会放过任何用它来记账的机会。","There was a bar at the Jolly Bargemen, with some alarmingly long chalk scores in it on the wall at the side of the door, which seemed to me to be never paid off.They had been there ever since I could remember, and had grown more than I had.But there was a quantity of chalk about our country, and perhaps the people neglected no opportunity of turning it to account."
"这是个星期六的晚上，我看到老板表情非常严肃地看着这些账单。但由于我是来找乔而不是找他的，所以我只是跟他说了声“晚上好”，然后就径直走进走廊尽头的休息室。室内生着一大团明亮的炉火，乔正在抽烟斗，旁边是沃甫赛先生和一个陌生人。乔像往常一样跟我打招呼：“嗨，皮普，老弟！”他说这话的时候，那个陌生人转过头来看着我。","It being Saturday night, I found the landlord looking rather grimly at these records, but as my business was with Joe and not with him, I merely wished him good evening, and passed into the common room at the end of the passage, where there was a bright large kitchen fire, and where Joe was smoking his pipe in company with Mr. Wopsle and a stranger.Joe greeted me as usual with “Halloa, Pip, old chap!” and the moment he said that, the stranger turned his head and looked at me. "
"他是个表情神秘的人，我之前从来没有见过这个人。他的脑袋歪向一边，一只眼睛半睁半闭，仿佛他正拿着一把隐形手枪瞄准什么东西。他嘴里叼着根烟斗，然后他取下烟斗，慢慢吐出所有的烟雾，自始至终都死死地盯着我，然后点了点头。于是，我点了点头，然后他又点了点头，而且在他旁边的长椅上让出一块地方，示意我可以坐在那里。","He was a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before.His head was all on one side, and one of his eyes was half shut up, as if he were taking aim at something with an invisible gun.He had a pipe in his mouth, and he took it out, and, after slowly blowing all his smoke away and looking hard at me all the time, nodded.So, I nodded, and then he nodded again, and made room on the settle beside him that I might sit down there."
"但是由于不管什么时候进入这种场合，我都习惯坐在乔的旁边，所以我说：“不用了，谢谢您，先生。”然后我坐在乔在对面那个长椅上给我腾出来的位置上。在我坐下之后，这个陌生人先是看了乔一眼，发现乔的注意力在别的地方之后，他又朝我点了点头，然后搓了搓他的腿——在我看来，他搓腿的方式非常奇怪。","But, as I was used to sit beside Joe whenever I entered that place of resort, I said “No, thank you, sir,” and fell into the space Joe made for me on the opposite settle.The strange man, after glancing at Joe, and seeing that his attention was otherwise engaged, nodded to me again when I had taken my seat, and then rubbed his leg—in a very odd way, as it struck me."
"“你刚刚说，”这个陌生人转过来对乔说，“你是个铁匠。”","“You was saying,” said the strange man, turning to Joe, “that you was a blacksmith.”"
"“对。我说我是个铁匠。”乔说道。","“Yes.I said it, you know,” said Joe."
"“你喝点什么，先生？顺便问一下，你还没有说你的名字。”","“What’ll you drink, Mr.—?You didn’t mention your name, by-the-bye.”"
"乔说了自己的名字，这个陌生人就喊乔的名字。“你喝点什么，格雷戈里先生？我请客。以酒结束今晚。”","Joe mentioned it now, and the strange man called him by it.“What’ll you drink, Mr. Gargery?At my expense?To top up with?”"
"“嗯，”乔说道，“老实说，我不太习惯让别人请客喝酒，我就自己买酒喝。”","“Well,” said Joe, “to tell you the truth, I ain’t much in the habit of drinking at anybody’s expense but my own.”"
"“习惯？不行，”陌生人回答说，“仅此一次，何况还是在星期六的晚上。来吧！点一种酒吧，格雷戈里先生。”","“Habit?No,” returned the stranger, “but once and away, and on a Saturday night too.Come!Put a name to it, Mr. Gargery.”"
"“我也不想太拘谨。”乔说道，“朗姆酒吧。”","“I wouldn’t wish to be stiff company,” said Joe.“Rum.”"
"“朗姆酒。”陌生人重复道，“那这位先生想点什么酒？”","“Rum,” repeated the stranger.“And will the other gentleman originate a sentiment.”"
"“朗姆酒。”沃甫赛先生说。","“Rum,” said Mr. Wopsle."
"“三杯朗姆酒！”陌生人对酒馆老板喊道，“三大杯！”","“Three Rums!” cried the stranger, calling to the landlord.“Glasses round!”"
"“这位先生，”乔向他介绍沃甫赛先生，“一定是个你乐意认识的人。他是教堂里的执事。”","“This other gentleman,” observed Joe, by way of introducing Mr. Wopsle, “is a gentleman that you would like to hear give it out.Our clerk at church.”"
"“啊哈！”陌生人说道，同时迅速地瞄了我一眼，“那座孤零零的教堂，就在沼泽地里，周围都是墓地！”","“Aha!” said the stranger, quickly, and cocking his eye at me.“The lonely church, right out on the marshes, with graves round it!”"
"“就是那座教堂。”乔说道。","“That’s it,” said Joe."
"这个陌生人抬起腿，放在他自己独占的长椅上，叼着烟斗的嘴里发出舒服的呼噜声。他戴着一顶耷拉着帽檐的宽边旅行帽，帽子下面用一块手帕当作头巾包在头上，所以看不见他的头发。当他看着炉火的时候，我发现他脸上先是露出狡黠的表情，接着又摆出一副似笑非笑的神情。","The stranger, with a comfortable kind of grunt over his pipe, put his legs up on the settle that he had to himself.He wore a flapping broad-brimmed traveler’s hat, and under it a handkerchief tied over his head in the manner of a cap: so that he showed no hair.As he looked at the fire, I thought I saw a cunning expression, followed by a half-laugh, come into his face."
"“我不太熟悉这个村子，先生们，但它看起来是个坐落在河边的、人迹罕至的村子。”","“I am not acquainted with this country, gentlemen, but it seems a solitary country towards the river.”"
"“大部分都是沼泽地，所以就人迹罕至。”乔说道。","“Most marshes is solitary,” said Joe."
"“确实，确实。你们在那里看见过任何吉普赛人、流浪汉或者是任何无业游民吗？”","“No doubt, no doubt.Do you find any gipsies, now, or tramps, or vagrants of any sort, out there?”"
"“没有，”乔说，“一个也没有，只不过偶尔有一两个逃犯。我们要找到他们也不容易。是不是，沃甫赛先生？”","“No,” said Joe; “none but a runaway convict now and then.And we don’t find them, easy.Eh, Mr. Wopsle?”"
"沃甫赛先生对之前的狼狈记忆深刻，他同意了乔的说法，但并不热情。","Mr. Wopsle, with a majestic remembrance of old discomfiture, assented; but not warmly."
"“看来你们都曾出去追捕过逃犯？”陌生人问道。","“Seems you have been out after such?” asked the stranger."
"“去过一次。”乔回答道，“你要知道，我们并不是想去抓他们，我们只是去旁观的，我，沃甫赛先生，还有皮普。是不是，皮普？”","“Once,” returned Joe.“Not that we wanted to take them, you understand; we went out as lookers on; me, and Mr. Wopsle, and Pip.Didn’t us, Pip?”"
"“对，乔。”","“Yes, Joe.”"
"这个陌生人再次看着我——仍然斜着眼睛，仿佛他正特意拿着他的隐形手枪瞄准我——同时说道：“他看起来很年轻。你叫他什么来着？”","The stranger looked at me again—still cocking his eye, as if he were expressly taking aim at me with his invisible gun—and said, “He’s a likely young parcel of bones that.What is it you call him?”"
"“皮普。”乔说道。","“Pip,” said Joe."
"“皮普是教名吗？”","“Christened Pip?”"
"“不是，皮普不是教名。”","“No, not christened Pip.”"
"“皮普是姓？”","“Surname Pip?”"
"“不是，”乔说，“算是一个他自己给自己起的姓。那时他还是个婴儿，后来也就这么叫了。”","“No,” said Joe, “it’s a kind of family name what he gave himself when a infant, and is called by.”"
"“是你的儿子？”","“Son of yours?”"
"“嗯，”乔沉思了一会儿说道——当然并不是因为这个问题有任何必要来思考，而是因为在“三个快活船员”酒馆里，抽着烟斗讨论事情看起来就像是在思考，“嗯，不是。不是的，他不是我的儿子。”","“Well,” said Joe, meditatively—not, of course, that it could be in anywise necessary to consider about it, but because it was the way at the Jolly Bargemen to seem to consider deeply about everything that was discussed over pipes; “well—no.No, he ain’t.”"
"“是侄子？”陌生人说道。","“Nevvy?” said the strange man."
"“嗯，”乔露出同样沉思的表情说道，“他不是——不骗你，他不是——我的侄子。”","“Well,” said Joe, with the same appearance of profound cogitation, “he is not—no, not to deceive you, he is not—my nevvy.”"
"“见鬼了，那他到底是谁？”陌生人问道。在我看来，他没有必要用这种语气来询问。","“What the Blue Blazes is he?” asked the stranger.It appeared to me to be an inquiry of unnecessary strength."
"沃甫赛先生这时插了进来，他对各种亲戚关系无所不知。他的职业习惯就是记清哪位女士和哪位男士因为有亲戚关系而不能结婚。所以他解释了我和乔之间的关系。插进来之后，沃甫赛先生最后结束时从《理查三世》中引用了一段台词。他声嘶力竭的朗诵让人惊悚万分。他似乎觉得自己的所作所为已经足以解释清楚了，最后他又补充道：“就像诗人说的那样。”","Mr. Wopsle struck in upon that; as one who knew all about relationships, having professional occasion to bear in mind what female relations a man might not marry; and expounded the ties between me and Joe.Having his hand in, Mr. Wopsle finished off with a most terrifically snarling passage from @Richard the Third@, and seemed to think he had done quite enough to account for it when he added,—“as the poet says.”"
"在这里，我要说到的一点是，当沃甫赛先生提到我的时候，他觉得既然提及我了，就有必要揪揪我的头发，让头发戳进我的眼睛里。我想不明白，为什么每一个身份地位跟他差不多的人来到我们家，总是要在相似的情形之下，让我经历同样的、让人愤怒的痛苦过程。虽然我不太记得自己年幼的时候曾是家庭社交圈里谈论的主题，但我记得的是，某些大手掌的人总是对我摆出长辈的派头，像这样摸摸我的头，弄疼我的眼睛。","And here I may remark that when Mr. Wopsle referred to me, he considered it a necessary part of such reference to rumple my hair and poke it into my eyes.I cannot conceive why everybody of his standing who visited at our house should always have put me through the same inflammatory process under similar circumstances.Yet I do not call to mind that I was ever in my earlier youth the subject of remark in our social family circle, but some large-handed person took some such ophthalmic steps to patronize me."
"在这一整段时间里，陌生人谁也不看，只看着我。他看着我的样子仿佛是已经决定最后要朝我开枪，把我击毙。但是他说了那句“见鬼”之后，就什么也没说了。直到兑过水的朗姆酒端上来之后，他才有所回应，这一回应可不得了。","All this while, the strange man looked at nobody but me, and looked at me as if he were determined to have a shot at me at last, and bring me down.But he said nothing after offering his Blue Blazes observation, until the glasses of rum-and-water were brought; and then he made his shot, and a most extraordinary shot it was."
"这一回应并不是言语上的评论，而是一幕直接针对我的哑剧。他直接对着我搅了搅他那兑了水的朗姆酒，然后直接对着我尝了尝他那兑了水的朗姆酒。他搅动、品尝着酒水，不是用给他拿来的汤匙，而是用一把锉刀。","It was not a verbal remark, but a proceeding in dump show, and was pointedly addressed to me.He stirred his rum-and-water pointedly at me, and he tasted his rum-and-water pointedly at me.And he stirred it and he tasted it: not with a spoon that was brought to him, but with a file."
"他这么做使得只有我一个人看见了这把锉刀。搅完了之后，他擦干净这把锉刀，然后把它放进胸前的口袋里。我一看见那个工具，就知道那是乔的锉刀，就知道他认识我遇见的那个逃犯。我坐在那里出神地凝视着他。然而此时他倚靠在长椅上，不太理睬我，说的主要是有关萝卜的事情。","He did this so that nobody but I saw the file; and when he had done it he wiped the file and put it in a breast-pocket.I knew it to be Joe’s file, and I knew that he knew my convict, the moment I saw the instrument.I sat gazing at him, spell-bound.But he now reclined on his settle, taking very little notice of me, and talking principally about turnips."
"星期六的晚上，我们村子里弥散着一种愉快的气氛。人们打扫干净，静静地休息，等待下一星期的新生活，这就让乔有勇气敢在星期六的时候比平时多在外面呆半个小时。这半个小时过去了，兑了水的朗姆酒也喝完了，乔起身离开，拉着我的手往外走。","There was a delicious sense of cleaning-up and making a quiet pause before going on in life afresh, in our village on Saturday nights, which stimulated Joe to dare to stay out half an hour longer on Saturdays than at other times.The half hour and the rum-and-water running out together, Joe got up to go, and took me by the hand."
"“等一下，格雷戈里先生。”陌生人说道，“我想我的口袋里有一枚崭新发亮的先令，要是我能找到的话就给这个孩子吧。”","“Stop half a moment, Mr. Gargery,” said the strange man.“I think I’ve got a bright new shilling somewhere in my pocket, and if I have, the boy shall have it.”"
"他在一把小零钱里找到这枚先令，用一张皱巴巴的纸包好了，然后递给我。“给你！”他说，“记住！这是你自己的。”","He looked it out from a handful of small change, folded it in some crumpled paper, and gave it to me.“Yours!” said he.“Mind!Your own.”"
"我谢过他，眼睛紧紧盯着他——这一举动已经超出了礼貌的范围——同时我紧紧地抓住乔。他跟乔说晚安，跟沃甫赛先生说晚安（沃甫赛先生和我们一起离开），而他只用他那瞄准的眼睛看了我一眼——不，不是看了一眼，因为他把眼睛闭上了，但是闭上一只眼睛也可以产生奇迹的。","I thanked him, staring at him far beyond the bounds of good manners, and holding tight to Joe.He gave Joe good-night, and he gave Mr. Wopsle good-night (who went out with us), and he gave me only a look with his aiming eye—no, not a look, for he shut it up, but wonders may be done with an eye by hiding it."
"在回家的路上，即使我有兴致讲话，我也只能一个人讲。因为沃甫赛先生在“三个快活船员”酒馆门口就和我们告别了，而乔一路上都张大嘴巴，尽可能让空气带走他嘴里的朗姆酒味。但是想起我之前的罪行和那个老相识，我脑子里就一片混乱，其他的什么也想不起来了。","On the way home, if I had been in a humor for talking, the talk must have been all on my side, for Mr. Wopsle parted from us at the door of the Jolly Bargemen, and Joe went all the way home with his mouth wide open, to rinse the rum out with as much air as possible.But I was in a manner stupefied by this turning up of my old misdeed and old acquaintance, and could think of nothing else."
"当我们来到厨房时，我姐姐并没有大发脾气。这种不常见的情形让乔有胆量把那枚闪亮的先令的事情告诉了她。“是个假的，我打赌。”乔太太很有把握地说道，“否则他也不会把它给这个小子！拿来让我们看看。”","My sister was not in a very bad temper when we presented ourselves in the kitchen, and Joe was encouraged by that unusual circumstance to tell her about the bright shilling.“A bad un, I’ll be bound,” said Mrs. Joe triumphantly, “or he wouldn’t have given it to the boy!Let’s look at it.”"
"我把先令从纸里拿出来，结果证实它是真的。“这是什么？”乔太太说着扔掉先令，抓起那张纸，“两张一英镑的钞票？”","I took it out of the paper, and it proved to be a good one.“But what’s this?” said Mrs. Joe, throwing down the shilling and catching up the paper.“Two One-Pound notes?”"
"的确是两张油乎乎、散发着体温的一英镑钞票，看起来似乎与乡下所有的牲畜市场都有过最亲密的接触。乔又抓起他的帽子，拿上钞票跑回“三个快活船员”酒馆，要把它们还给它们的主人。乔离开之后，我坐在自己平常坐的那个凳子上，两眼无神地看着我姐姐。我很肯定地觉得，那个人已经不在那里了。","Nothing less than two fat sweltering one-pound notes that seemed to have been on terms of the warmest intimacy with all the cattle markets in the county.Joe caught up his hat again, and ran with them to the Jolly Bargemen to restore them to their owner.While he was gone, I sat down on my usual stool and looked vacantly at my sister, feeling pretty sure that the man would not be there."
"不久乔回来了，他说那个人已经走了，但是乔在“三个快活船员”酒馆里给他留了言，讲了关于钞票的事。然后我姐姐用一张纸把它们密封包好，放进一个装饰茶壶里。钞票上面盖一些干玫瑰花瓣，然后把茶壶放在客厅里的一个柜子上。它们就在那里，成了我的噩梦，日日夜夜折磨着我。","Presently, Joe came back, saying that the man was gone, but that he, Joe, had left word at the Three Jolly Bargemen concerning the notes.Then my sister sealed them up in a piece of paper, and put them under some dried rose-leaves in an ornamental tea-pot on the top of a press in the state parlor.There they remained, a nightmare to me, many and many a night and day."
"可悲的是，我睡觉都睡不安稳，我会想起那个陌生人用他的隐形手枪瞄准我，想起我私下跟逃犯往来的事，这是多么罪恶、粗俗而且下贱的行为——而更显卑劣的是，我之前已经忘记了这件事。那把锉刀也像鬼魂一样缠着我。一种恐惧感侵袭了我，因为在我最意想不到的时候，那把锉刀出现在了我眼前。我想着下个星期三要去郝维仙小姐家的事，这才把自己哄睡。睡梦之中，我看见那把锉刀透过门朝我伸了过来，但却看不见拿着锉刀的人，我大叫着醒来。","I had sadly broken sleep when I got to bed, through thinking of the strange man taking aim at me with his invisible gun, and of the guiltily coarse and common thing it was, to be on secret terms of conspiracy with convicts—a feature in my low career that I had previously forgotten.I was haunted by the file too.A dread possessed me that when I least expected it, the file would reappear.I coaxed myself to sleep by thinking of Miss Havisham’s, next Wednesday; and in my sleep I saw the file coming at me out of a door, without seeing who held it, and I screamed myself awake."
"第十一章","Chapter 11"
"到了约定的时间，我回到了郝维仙小姐家。我在门口迟疑了很久才按了铃，这时埃斯特拉出来了。她把我接进去后锁了门，就像她以前做的那样。她再一次带我走进那条黑暗的通道，那里放着她的蜡烛。刚开始，她没有理我。拿起蜡烛后，她才转过头来，傲慢地对我说：“今天走这条路。”然后，便带我向房子的另一个地方走去。","At the appointed time I returned to Miss Havisham’s, and my hesitating ring at the gate brought out Estella.She locked it after admitting me, as she had done before, and again preceded me into the dark passage where her candle stood.She took no notice of me until she had the candle in her hand, when she looked over her shoulder, superciliously saying, “You are to come this way today,” and took me to quite another part of the house."
"路很长，似乎遍布了整个庄园的方形地下室。当我们穿过方形地下室的一边，来到尽头时，她停了下来，放下蜡烛，打开了一扇门。这里，阳光又出现了。我发现自己正位于一个小小的、铺好的院子里面。院子对面立着一栋独立的寓所，看起来好像曾经是现已停产的酿酒作坊的经理或主管的房子。房子外面的墙上挂着一个钟。这个钟和郝维仙小姐房里的钟以及她手上戴的表一样，停在了八点四十分。","The passage was a long one, and seemed to pervade the whole square basement of the Manor House.We traversed but one side of the square, however, and at the end of it she stopped, and put her candle down and opened a door.Here, the daylight reappeared, and I found myself in a small paved court-yard, the opposite side of which was formed by a detached dwelling-house, that looked as if it had once belonged to the manager or head clerk of the extinct brewery.There was a clock in the outer wall of this house.Like the clock in Miss Havisham’s room, and like Miss Havisham’s watch, it had stopped at twenty minutes to nine."
"走进敞开的门，我们来到了一个阴暗的房间。房间位于一楼的后部，天花板很低。房间里有几个人，埃斯特拉向他们走过去时对我说：“你走到那里去，站在那里，孩子，有人叫你时再过来。”“那里”指的是窗户。我走过去，站在“那里”望着外面，心里很不舒服。","We went in at the door, which stood open, and into a gloomy room with a low ceiling, on the ground floor at the back.There was some company in the room, and Estella said to me as she joined it,“You are to go and stand there, boy, till you are wanted.”“There”, being the window, I crossed to it, and stood “there,” in a very uncomfortable state of mind, looking out."
"窗户是落地式的，从上到下都敞开着，面对着这个荒废的花园中最为凄凉的一角：地上满是腐烂的菜梗子，一棵黄杨树立在那里，好久都没有被修剪过了，活像一个布丁。树顶新长了一团叶子，形状怪异，颜色和原来树的颜色不一样，好像是布丁的一部分粘在锅底上，被烧焦了一样。我观察黄杨树时就有了这种朴实的想法。昨晚下了一场小雪，就我所知，现在其他任何地方都看不到雪的痕迹了。但是，在这个花园阴冷的角落里，有一些雪还没有完全融化。风卷起残雪，形成小小的漩涡，敲打着窗户，仿佛在质问我，为什么要来这里。","It opened to the ground, and looked into a most miserable corner of the neglected garden, upon a rank ruin of cabbage-stalks, and one box tree that had been clipped round long ago, like a pudding, and had a new growth at the top of it, out of shape and of a different color, as if that part of the pudding had stuck to the saucepan and got burnt.This was my homely thought, as I contemplated the box-tree.There had been some light snow, overnight, and it lay nowhere else to my knowledge; but, it had not quite melted from the cold shadow of this bit of garden, and the wind caught it up in little eddies and threw it at the window, as if it pelted me for coming there."
"我推测，我的到来让屋子里的人停止了谈话，打量起我来。除了映在玻璃窗户上的熊熊炉火，我没有看到屋子里的其他事物。但我知道，此时自己正处于人们的密切观察之中，我全身的关节都僵硬极了。","I divined that my coming had stopped conversation in the room, and that its other occupants were looking at me.I could see nothing of the room except the shining of the fire in the window glass, but I stiffened in all my joints with the consciousness that I was under close inspection."
"屋子里有三位女士和一位先生。我站在窗户边还没有五分钟，他们就向我传递了一个信息，即他们都是讨厌的家伙和骗子，但他们每个人都假装不知道其他人是讨厌的家伙和骗子。因为他或她一旦承认自己知道，就相当于承认了自己也是讨厌的家伙和骗子。","There were three ladies in the room and one gentleman.Before I had been standing at the window five minutes, they somehow conveyed to me that they were all toadies and humbugs, but that each of them pretended not to know that the others were toadies and humbugs: because the admission that he or she did know it, would have made him or her out to be a toady and humbug."
"他们都在等待某个人的光荣接见，一个个无精打采、沉闷至极。连最健谈的女士都不得不勉强找些话讲，以免困得打哈欠。这位女士名叫卡米拉。她让我想起我的姐姐，不同的是，她更年长一些，而且（我一看到她就发现了）长着一副更愚钝的面孔。事实上，当我进一步了解她后，我开始觉得，她有任何特点的话都是她的万幸了，因为她的脸就像是一堵死墙，那样的空白，那样的高不可攀。","They all had a listless and dreary air of waiting somebody’s pleasure, and the most talkative of the ladies had to speak quite rigidly to repress a yawn.This lady, whose name was Camilla, very much reminded me of my sister, with the difference that she was older, and (as I found when I caught sight of her) of a blunter cast of features.Indeed, when I knew her better I began to think it was a Mercy she had any features at all, so very blank and high was the dead wall of her face."
"“可怜的、亲爱的人啊！”这位女士说，那粗鲁的态度和我姐姐简直如出一辙，","“Poor dear soul!” said this lady, with an abruptness of manner quite my sister's."
"“他不与任何人为敌，却偏偏和自己过不去！”","“Nobody’s enemy but his own!”"
"“和其他人作对还更好一些，”那位先生说，“这样才更自然一些。”","“It would be much more commendable to be somebody else’s enemy,” said the gentleman; “far more natural.”"
"“雷蒙德表弟，”另一个女士说，“我们应该爱我们的邻里。”","“Cousin Raymond,” observed another lady, “we are to love our neighbor.”"
"“萨拉·鄱凯特，”雷蒙德表弟回答，“要是一个人连他自己也不爱，谁会爱他呢？”","“Sarah Pocket,” returned Cousin Raymond, “if a man is not his own neighbor, who is?”"
"鄱凯特小姐笑了，卡米拉也笑了，她说（尽量抑制住打哈欠的欲望）：“糊涂！”但我想，他们似乎都觉得这也是一个高见。另一个还未开口说过话的女士严肃而又强调地说：“确实如此！”","Miss Pocket laughed, and Camilla laughed and said (checking a yawn), “The idea!”But I thought they seemed to think it rather a good idea too.The other lady, who had not spoken yet, said gravely and emphatically, “Very true!”"
"“可怜的人！”卡米拉立即接着说（我知道，他们在这段时间内都在看着我），“他这么古怪！","“Poor soul!” Camilla presently went on (I knew they had all been looking at me in the mean time), “he is so very strange!”"
"汤姆的妻子死时，他竟听不进别人的劝告，意识不到让孩子们在服孝期间穿上重孝服的重要性，这说起来有人会相信么？‘天啊！’他还说，‘卡米拉，这些可怜的小家伙已经失去了亲人，穿上黑衣服又有什么意义呢？’马修就是这样！真糊涂！”","Would anyone believe that when Tom’s wife died, he actually could not be induced to see the importance of the children’s having the deepest of trimmings to their mourning?‘Good Lord!’ says he, ‘Camilla, what can it signify so long as the poor bereaved little things are in black?’So like Matthew!The idea!”"
"“他有他自己的优点，他有他自己的优点。”雷蒙德表弟说，“如果我否认他有他自己的优点，上天不会同意的。但是，他从来没有，而且永远也不会有任何合乎时宜的观点。”","“Good points in him, good points in him,” said Cousin Raymond; “Heaven forbid I should deny good points in him; but he never had, and he never will have, any sense of the proprieties.”"
"“你知道我有义务，”卡米拉说，“我有义务要坚持我们的传统。我说,为了家族的声誉，这样不行。我告诉他，不穿重孝服家族就会蒙羞。我从早餐一直吵到晚餐。我都不能正常消化了。最后，他怒冲冲地拂袖而去，生气地说：‘那么你想怎么做就怎么做吧。’我立刻冒着大雨，跑出去买重孝服。感谢上帝，这对我来说，也算是一个安慰吧。”","“You know I was obliged,” said Camilla, “I was obliged to be firm.I said, ‘It WILL NOT DO, for the credit of the family.’I told him that, without deep trimmings, the family was disgraced.I cried about it from breakfast till dinner.I injured my digestion.And at last he flung out in his violent way, and said, with a D, ‘Then do as you like.’Thank Goodness it will always be a consolation to me to know that I instantly went out in a pouring rain and bought the things.”"
"“他付钱，是吗？”埃斯特拉问。","“He paid for them, did he not?” asked Estella."
"“我亲爱的孩子，谁付钱并不是重点。”卡米拉回答，“是我买的。每当我夜里醒来时，我总是会内心很平静地想起这件事。”","“It’s not the question, my dear child, who paid for them,” returned Camilla.“I bought them.And I shall often think of that with peace, when I wake up in the night.”"
"突然响起一阵铃声，夹杂着某声叫喊或呼唤的回响。那叫声是顺着我来时的那条走廊传来的。谈话被打断了，埃斯特拉跟我说：“孩子，现在你可以过去了。”我转过身时，他们都用最轻蔑的眼神看着我。我走出去后，听到萨拉·鄱凯特说：“我敢说！接下来还有什么！”卡米拉义愤填膺地补充说：“还有比这更奇怪的事么！糊——涂——啊！”","The ringing of a distant bell, combined with the echoing of some cry or call along the passage by which I had come, interrupted the conversation and caused Estella to say to me, “Now, boy!”On my turning round, they all looked at me with the utmost contempt, and, as I went out, I heard Sarah Pocket say, “Well I am sure!What next!” and Camilla add, with indignation, “Was there ever such a fancy!The i-de-a!”"
"当我们借着烛光，沿着那条黑暗的走廊前行时，埃斯特拉突然停下来，转过来把脸挨近我，用她那种讥讽的语气说：","As we were going with our candle along the dark passage, Estella stopped all of a sudden, and, facing round, said in her taunting manner with her face quite close to mine:"
"“那么？”","“Well?”"
"“什么，小姐？”我回答道，差点就撞到她身上，赶紧停了下来。","“Well, miss?” I answered, almost falling over her and checking myself. "
"她站着盯着我看，我当然也站着盯着她看。","She stood looking at me, and, of course, I stood looking at her."
"“我漂亮吗？”","“Am I pretty?”"
"“是的，我觉得你很漂亮。”","“Yes; I think you are very pretty.”"
"“我傲慢吗？”","“Am I insulting?”"
"“不像上次那么傲慢了。”我说。","“Not so much so as you were last time,” said I."
"“不像上次那样？”","“Not so much so?”"
"“是的。”","“No.”"
"在她问最后一个问题时，已经发火了。当我回答了之后，她用尽全身力气，狠狠地搧了我一耳光。","She fired when she asked the last question, and she slapped my face with such force as she had, when I answered it."
"“那现在呢？”她说，","“Now?” said she."
"“你这个粗鲁的小怪物，现在你觉得我怎么样？”","“You little coarse monster, what do you think of me now?”"
"“我不告诉你。”","“I shall not tell you.”"
"“因为你要上楼去说。是不是？”","“Because you are going to tell, up-stairs.Is that it?”"
"“不，”我说，“不是那样的。”","“No,” said I, “that’s not it.”"
"“为什么不哭了呢，你这个可怜的小家伙？”","“Why don’t you cry again, you little wretch?”"
"“因为我不会再为你哭了。”我说。我想，和过去的话一样，这肯定又是一个谎言。因为那时在我内心深处，正在为她哭泣，而且我知道后来她将给我带来多大的痛苦。","“Because I’ll never cry for you again,” said I.It was, I suppose, as false a declaration as ever was made; for I was inwardly crying for her then, and I know what I know of the pain she cost me afterwards."
"经过这段插曲后，我们继续爬楼梯。当我们上楼时，遇到了一位正摸索着下楼的先生。","We went on our way up-stairs after this episode; and, as we were going up, we met a gentleman groping his way down."
"“这个人是谁？”这位先生问道，他停了下来，看着我。","“Whom have we here?” asked the gentleman, stopping and looking at me."
"“一个男孩。”埃斯特拉说。","“A boy,” said Estella."
"这位先生身体很结实，皮肤非常黝黑，头特别大，配有一双庞大的手。他用大手捏住我的下巴，在烛光的照耀下，把我的脸抬起来细细观察。他年纪不是很大，头顶却已经秃了，浓黑的眉毛像灌木丛一样茂密，竖立而不弯曲。他脸上的双眼深深地陷了进去，目光犀利而又多疑，令人反感。他戴着一串大表链，满脸又黑又硬的胡子茬，如果他留起来的话，肯定会长满络腮胡子。他和我没有什么关系，而且当时我也预想不到将来他会和我有什么关系。不过今天既然遇到了，我就趁机好好地端详一下他。","He was a burly man of an exceedingly dark complexion, with an exceedingly large head and a corresponding large hand.He took my chin in his large hand and turned up my face to have a look at me by the light of the candle.He was prematurely bald on the top of his head, and had bushy black eyebrows that wouldn’t lie down but stood up bristling.His eyes were set very deep in his head, and were disagreeably sharp and suspicious.He had a large watchchain, and strong black dots where his beard and whiskers would have been if he had let them.He was nothing to me, and I could have had no foresight then, that he ever would be anything to me, but it happened that I had this opportunity of observing him well."
"“你是附近的小孩吗？喂？”他问。","“Boy of the neighborhood? Hey? ”said he."
"“是的，先生。”我回答道。","“Yes, sir,” said I."
"“你怎么到这里来了？”","“How do you come here?”"
"“郝维仙小姐派人叫我来的，先生。”我解释道。","“Miss Havisham sent for me, sir,” I explained."
"“那么！举止要端正。我和小男孩相处得可多了，你们都是一帮坏小子。现在注意点！”他说道，冲我皱着眉，咬了咬他那只粗大的食指，“你可要举止端正！”","“Well!Behave yourself.I have a pretty large experience of boys, and you’re a bad set of fellows.Now mind!” said he, biting the side of his great forefinger as he frowned at me, “you behave yourself!”"
"说完这些话之后，他终于放过我了——我很开心，因为他的手有一股肥皂的味道——然后，他就走下楼去了。我猜，他会不会是一个医生。但又一想，不，他不会是一个医生的，否则他不会这么粗鲁，这么没有说服力。没有太多的时间来考虑这个问题了，因为我们很快就进入郝维仙小姐的房间。郝维仙小姐和屋子里的一切跟我上一次离开的时候一模一样。埃斯特拉离开了，留下我一个人站在门口。我一直站在那里，最后郝维仙小姐才把视线从化妆台转到我身上来。","With those words, he released me—which I was glad of, for his hand smelt of scented soap—and went his way down-stairs.I wondered whether he could be a doctor; but no, I thought; he couldn’t be a doctor, or he would have a quieter and more persuasive manner.There was not much time to consider the subject, for we were soon in Miss Havisham’s room, where she and everything else were just as I had left them.Estella left me standing near the door, and I stood there until Miss Havisham cast her eyes upon me from the dressing-table."
"“那么！”她说，一点也不震惊或惊讶，“那些日子已经过去了，是吗？”","“So!” she said, without being startled or surprised; “the days have worn away, have they?”"
"“是的，夫人。今天是——”","“Yes, ma’am.Today is—”"
"“停，停，停！”她不耐烦地挥动着手指，","“There, there, there!” with the impatient movement of her fingers."
"“我不想知道。你准备好玩耍了吗？”","“I don’t want to know.Are you ready to play?”"
"我不得不疑惑地回答：“我想不行，夫人。”","I was obliged to answer in some confusion, “I don’t think I am, ma’am.”"
"“不再玩牌了吗？”她用探寻的神情看着我，用命令的口吻说。","“Not at cards again?” she demanded, with a searching look."
"“好的，夫人，如果您要我玩牌，我就玩牌。”","“Yes, ma’am; I could do that, if I was wanted.”"
"“既然这个房间对你来说又旧又恐怖，孩子，”郝维仙小姐不耐烦地说，“你不愿意玩耍，那你愿意干活吗？”","“Since this house strikes you old and grave, boy,” said Miss Havisham, impatiently, “and you are unwilling to play, are you willing to work?”"
"比起其他问题，这个问题让我的心情顿时好了许多，我回答说，我非常愿意干活。","I could answer this inquiry with a better heart than I had been able to find for the other question, and I said I was quite willing."
"“那就去对面的房间。”她说，用干枯的手指着我后面的门，“在那里等我过去。”","“Then go into that opposite room,” said she, pointing at the door behind me with her withered hand, “and wait there till I come.”"
"我穿过楼梯平台，走进她指的那个房间。这个房间也是一点阳光也没有，而且散发出一股令人窒息和压抑的味道。潮湿的老式火炉刚刚被点燃，但火苗一点也不像是要烧旺起来，而更像是快要熄灭了的样子。屋里飘着的烟让人很不舒服，似乎比外面干净的空气还要寒冷——就像我们自己沼泽地里的雾气一样。在高高的烛台上放着几根蜡烛，散发出冬日里的寒气，微弱地照着屋里的一切，或者，说得清楚一点——微弱地扰乱了屋里的黑暗。房间很宽敞，我敢说，从前这里肯定很漂亮。但现在，目光所及的每一件东西都覆盖着灰尘和霉菌，而且正在腐化成碎片。最显眼的东西是一张长桌子，上面铺着一条桌布。仿佛一场盛宴已经准备好了，但整间房子和所有的钟表却一起停住了。桌布中间摆着分隔饰盘和中央摆设之类的东西，上面结满了厚厚的蜘蛛网，所以很难辨别出它的形状。当我沿着那块黄色的桌布看过去时，我觉得它像一棵生长着的黑木耳。我看到长着斑点腿的蜘蛛，满身污秽地在木耳里跑进跑出，好像这个蜘蛛王国里发生了什么极其重要的事情一样。","I crossed the staircase landing, and entered the room she indicated.From that room, too, the daylight was completely excluded, and it had an airless smell that was oppressive.A fire had been lately kindled in the damp old-fashioned grate, and it was more disposed to go out than to burn up, and the reluctant smoke which hung in the room seemed colder than the clearer air—like our own marsh mist.Certain wintry branches of candles on the high chimneypiece faintly lighted the chamber: or, it would be more expressive to say, faintly troubled its darkness.It was spacious, and I dare say had once been handsome, but every discernible thing in it was covered with dust and mould, and dropping to pieces.The most prominent object was a long table with a tablecloth spread on it, as if a feast had been in preparation when the house and the clocks all stopped together.An epergne or centerpiece of some kind was in the middle of this cloth; it was so heavily overhung with cobwebs that its form was quite undistinguishable; and, as I looked along the yellow expanse out of which I remember its seeming to grow, like a black fungus, I saw speckled-legged spiders with blotchy bodies running home to it, and running out from it, as if some circumstances of the greatest public importance had just transpired in the spider community."
"我还听到了老鼠的声音，在嵌板后面咯咯地响，似乎蜘蛛王国发生的事严重影响了它们的利益。但是，黑甲壳虫却对这些骚动毫不在意，它们拖着年迈的步伐在火炉边摸索着、思考着，好像它们又近视又耳聋，跟其他人不相往来。","I heard the mice too, rattling behind the panels, as if the same occurrence were important to their interests.But, the black beetles took no notice of the agitation, and groped about the hearth in a ponderous elderly way, as if they were short-sighted and hard of hearing, and not on terms with one another."
"这些爬行动物深深地吸引了我的注意。我正在远处观察它们，突然，郝维仙小姐把一只手放在我肩膀上。她的另一只手里握着一根手杖，杖头是弯曲的。她倚在这根手杖上，活像这个地方的女巫。","These crawling things had fascinated my attention and I was watching them from a distance, when Miss Havisham laid a hand upon my shoulder.In her other hand she had a crutch-headed stick on which she leaned, and she looked like the Witch of the place."
"“这里，”她说，用手杖指着长桌子，“就是我死后放置尸体的地方。他们会来这里看我。”","“This,” said she, pointing to the long table with her stick, “is where I will be laid when I am dead.They shall come and look at me here.”"
"听完后，我隐约有些担心，怕她会躺在桌子上立刻死去。这令我一下子记起了在集市上见到的那个恐怖蜡像，我吓得缩成一团，而她的手还放在我的肩上。","With some vague misgiving that she might get upon the table then and there and die at once, the complete realization of the ghastly waxwork at the Fair, I shrank under her touch."
"“你觉得那是什么？”她问我，再一次用那根手杖指着，“那个结满蜘蛛网的东西？”","“What do you think that is?” she asked me, again pointing with her stick; “that, where those cobwebs are?”"
"“我猜不出来那是什么，夫人。”","“I can’t guess what it is, ma’am.”"
"“那是一个大蛋糕。一个结婚蛋糕。我的结婚蛋糕！”","“It’s a great cake.A bride-cake.Mine!”"
"她用愤怒的目光扫视着这个房间，然后突然抓住我的肩膀，靠在我身上说：“来，来，来！扶我走，扶我走！”","She looked all round the room in a glaring manner, and then said, leaning on me while her hand twitched my shoulder, “Come, come, come!Walk me, walk me!”"
"我这才领悟到，我要干的活就是扶着郝维仙小姐在这个房间里一圈一圈地走着。因此，我立刻开始干了起来。我让她靠在我肩上，模仿彭波契克先生轻便马车的步伐走着（我一走进这座房子就有这样模仿的冲动）。","I made out from this, that the work I had to do, was to walk Miss Havisham round and round the room.Accordingly, I started at once, and she leaned upon my shoulder, and we went away at a pace that might have been an imitation (founded on my first impulse under that roof) of Mr. Pumblechook’s chaise-cart."
"她身体很弱，过了一会儿，她说：“慢一点！”但是，走着走着，我们还是不耐烦地加快了脚步。我们走路的时候，她一边用手紧紧地抓住我的肩膀，一边开口说话，这让我相信，我们之所以走得这么快，是因为她的脑子转得很快。走了一会儿后，她说：“叫埃斯特拉过来！”于是我跑了出去，站在楼梯平台上，像上次一样大喊那个名字。看到埃斯特拉的烛光出现后，我回到郝维仙小姐身边，我们又开始绕着那个房间走。","She was not physically strong, and after a little time said, “Slower!”Still, we went at an impatient fitful speed, and as we went, she twitched the hand upon my shoulder, and worked her mouth, and led me to believe that we were going fast because her thoughts went fast.After a while she said, “Call Estella!”So I went out on the landing and roared that name as I had done on the previous occasion.When her light appeared, I returned to Miss Havisham, and we started away again round and round the room."
"要是只有埃斯特拉一个人来看我们绕屋子转，我就已经感到很不舒服了。况且，这次她竟带来了我在楼下见过的那三位女士和一位先生，我不知道该怎么办。按礼节来说，我应该停下来。但郝维仙小姐在我的肩膀上抓了一下，我们继续走着——我的表情很尴尬，我自己觉得，他们会认为这完全是我的把戏。","If only Estella had come to be a spectator of our proceedings, I should have felt sufficiently discontented; but, as she brought with her the three ladies and the gentleman whom I had seen below, I didn’t know what to do.In my politeness, I would have stopped; but, Miss Havisham twitched my shoulder, and we posted on—with a shame-faced consciousness on my part that they would think it was all my doing."
"“亲爱的郝维仙小姐，”萨拉·鄱凯特小姐说，“您看起来气色真好啊！”","“Dear Miss Havisham,” said Miss Sarah Pocket.“How well you look!”"
"“我不好。”郝维仙小姐回答说，“我皮肤发黄、骨瘦如柴。”","“I do not,” returned Miss Havisham.“I am yellow skin and bone.”"
"看到鄱凯特小姐遭到粗鲁的回应，卡米拉高兴极了。她悲伤地注视着郝维仙小姐，喃喃地说：“可怜的人啊！当然不能指望她气色好了，可怜的人啊。你就会胡说！”","Camilla brightened when Miss Pocket met with this rebuff; and she murmured, as she plaintively contemplated Miss Havisham, “Poor dear soul!Certainly not to be expected to look well, poor thing.The idea!”"
"“你怎么样？”郝维仙小姐对卡米拉说。","“And how are you?” said Miss Havisham to Camilla."
"当时，我们正走到离卡米拉很近的地方，我当然是应该停下来的，可是郝维仙小姐却没有停。于是，我们继续走着，我觉得卡米拉肯定非常恨我。","As we were close to Camilla then, I would have stopped as a matter of course, only Miss Havisham wouldn’t stop.We swept on, and I felt that I was highly obnoxious to Camilla."
"“谢谢您的关心，郝维仙小姐。”卡米拉回答，“想多好我就有多好。”","“Thank you, Miss Havisham,” she returned, “I am as well as can be expected.”"
"“怎么，你怎么了？”郝维仙小姐问道，声音极其尖锐。","“Why, what’s the matter with you?” asked Miss Havisham, with exceeding sharping."
"“没有什么值得提的。”卡米拉回答道，“我不想表白我的感情，但夜里思念您已经成为了我的习惯，连我自己都被丢在一边了。”","“Nothing worth mentioning,” replied Camilla.“I don’t wish to make a display of my feelings, but I have habitually thought of you more in the night than I am quite equal to.”"
"“那就不要想我。”郝维仙小姐反驳道。","“Then don’t think of me,” retorted Miss Havisham."
"“说得容易！”卡米拉亲切地回答道，她努力不让自己抽泣，可是她上唇一紧，眼泪就流了出来，","“Very easily said!” remarked Camilla, amiably repressing a sob, while a hitch came into her upper lip, and her tears overflowed."
"“雷蒙德可以作证，到了晚上我就不得不喝姜酒、服用提神药。雷蒙德可以作证，我两条腿上的神经抽搐得多么厉害。我一想到我爱的人，心里就会担忧，还会噎住、神经抽搐，这一切对我来说已不是什么新鲜事了。要是我不那么重感情，不那么多愁善感的话，我的消化就会好一点，神经也能跟铁一样坚硬了。我敢说我希望能够如此。但要让我不能在夜里思念您的话——简直就是胡说！”讲到这里，她已是泪流满面了。","“Raymond is a witness what ginger and sal volatile I am obliged to take in the night.Raymond is a witness what nervous jerkings I have in my legs.Chokings and nervous jerkings, however, are nothing new to me when I think with anxiety of those I love.If I could be less affectionate and sensitive, I should have a better digestion and an iron set of nerves.I am sure I wish it could be so.But as to not thinking of you in the night—The idea!”Here, a burst of tears."
"她所提到的雷蒙德，我想应该就是这里的这位先生，而且我想这位先生应该就是卡米拉先生。在这个时刻，卡米拉先生来救场了。他用安慰和称赞的语气说：“卡米拉，亲爱的，大家都知道你很看重亲情，这渐渐伤害了你的健康，使你的一条腿比另一条短了。”","The Raymond referred to, I understood to be the gentleman present, and him I understood to be Mr. Camilla.He came to the rescue at this point, and said in a consolatory and complimentary voice, “Camilla, my dear, it is well known that your family feelings are gradually undermining you to the extent of making one of your legs shorter than the other.”"
"“我可没想过，”那位严肃的夫人——我只听过一次她的声音——说道：“思念某个人就要从那个人身上得到一大笔好处，亲爱的。”","“I am not aware,” observed the grave lady whose voice I had heard but once, “that to think of any person is to make a great claim upon that person, my dear.”"
"现在我看到，萨拉·鄱凯特小姐是一个身材矮小、脸色干枯、皮肤泛黄、满脸皱纹的老女人。她那张小小的脸好像是用胡桃壳做成的，一张大大的嘴如同没有胡须的猫嘴。她表示赞同地说：“当然不是想得到什么好处，亲爱的。哼！”","Miss Sarah Pocket, whom I now saw to be a little dry brown corrugated old woman, with a small face that might have been made of walnut shells, and a large mouth like a cat’s without the whiskers, supported this position by saying, “No, indeed, my dear. Hem!”"
"“想念是再容易不过的了。”那位严肃的夫人说。","“Thinking is easy enough,” said the grave lady."
"“还有什么比想念更容易，你说呢？”萨拉·鄱凯特表示同意。","“What is easier, you know?” assented Miss Sarah Pocket."
"“噢，是的，是的！”卡米拉大叫道，她百感交集，激动的感情似乎从她的腿里直涌进胸里，","“Oh, yes, yes!” cried Camilla, whose fermenting feeling appeared to rise from her legs to her bosom."
"“这是完全正确的！太重感情是一种弱点，但我实在是情不自禁。要是我能不那么重感情的话，我的健康无疑会好点。但就是能改变，我也不会改。虽然这给我带来了许多痛苦，但当我夜里醒来，知道我是一个重感情的人时，倒给了我不少安慰。”讲到这里，她又泪流满面了。","“It’s all very true!It’s a weakness to be so affectionate, but I can’t help it.No doubt my health would be much better if it was otherwise, still I wouldn’t change my disposition if I could.It’s the cause of much suffering, but it’s a consolation to know I posses it, when I wake up in the night.”Here another burst of feeling."
"这段期间，郝维仙小姐和我没有停下一步，一直绕着房间转圈，有时擦过来访者的裙角，有时走到这个沉闷房间的另一边，离他们远远的。","Miss Havisham and I had never stopped all this time, but kept going round and round the room: now, brushing against the skirts of the visitors: now, giving them the whole length of the dismal chamber."
"“只有马修！”卡米拉说，","“There’s Matthew!” said Camilla."
"“从不看重任何血缘关系，从不来这里探望郝维仙小姐！而我经常解开紧身褡的带子，在沙发上躺好几个小时，毫无知觉，偏着头，头发全垂着，我的脚不知道放在哪里——”","“Never mixing with any natural ties, never coming here to see how Miss Havisham is!I have taken to the sofa with my staylace cut, and have lain there hours, insensible, with my head over the side, and my hair all down, and my feet I don’t know where—”"
"（“比你的头还要高许多，亲爱的。”卡米拉先生说。）","(“Much higher than your head, my love,” said Mr. Camilla.)"
"“我就是在那里躺好几个小时，思考着马修奇怪而又令人费解的行为，却没有人感谢我。”","“I have gone off into that state, hours and hours, on account of Matthew’s strange and inexplicable conduct, and nobody has thanked me.”"
"“老实说，我觉得没有人会感谢你。”那位严肃的夫人插嘴说道。","“Really I must say I should think not!” interposed the grave lady."
"“你知道的，亲爱的。”萨拉·鄱凯特小姐（一个外表温和、内心恶毒的人）补充说，“你该问问自己，你希望谁感谢你呢，亲爱的？”","“You see, my dear,” added Miss Sarah Pocket (a blandly vicious personage), “the question to put to yourself is, who did you expect to thank you, my love?”"
"“我不指望谁来感谢我还是怎么样。”卡米拉继续说，“我连续好几个小时保持那样的状态，雷蒙德看到我噎得有多厉害，连姜汁也完全不起作用了。街道对面那家弹钢琴的人都听到我抽噎的声音，可怜的孩子还以为是远处鸽子的叫声。现在，我却在这里被人说三道四——”讲到这里，卡米拉把手放在喉咙上，开始产生化学反应，想在那里形成新的化合物。","“Without expecting any thanks, or anything of the sort,” resumed Camilla, “I have remained in that state, hours and hours, and Raymond is a witness of the extent to which I have choked, and what the total inefficacy of ginger has been, and I have been heard at the pianoforte-tuner’s across the street, where the poor mistaken children have even supposed it to be pigeons cooing at a distance—and now to be told—.”Here Camilla put her hand to her throat, and began to be quite chemical as to the formation of new combinations there."
"马修的名字再次被提及时，郝维仙小姐让我停了下来，她也不走了，站在那里盯着说话的人。这个变化产生了一个很大的作用，让卡米拉的化学反应突然停止了。","When this same Matthew was mentioned, Miss Havisham stopped me and herself, and stood looking at the speaker.This change had a great influence in bringing Camilla’s chemistry to a sudden end."
"“马修最终会来看我的。”郝维仙小姐厉声说，“那时我就会躺在那张桌子上。而他就站在——那里，”郝维仙小姐用手杖敲打桌子，“在我头的旁边！而你站在那里！你的丈夫站在那里！萨拉·鄱凯特在那里！乔治亚娜在那里！现在你们都知道了，当你们来分食我的时候，自己应该站在哪里了。那么你们该走了！”","“Matthew will come and see me at last,” said Miss Havisham, sternly, “when I am laid on that table.That will be his place—there,” striking the table with her stick, “at my head!And yours will be there!And your husband’s there!And Sarah Pocket’s there!And Georgiana’s there!Now you all know where to take your stations when you come to feast upon me.And now go!”"
"每提到一个名字，她就用手杖在桌子上敲打一个新的地方。然后，她说道：“扶我走，扶我走！”于是，我们又开始走路了。","At the mention of each name, she had struck the table with her stick in a new place.She now said, “Walk me, walk me!” and we went on again."
"“我想没有其他的办法了。”卡米拉大声说，“只有遵从意思，就此离开了。能够看到心中所爱，尽一点义务，即使时间短暂，也算是一种慰藉。夜里醒来，想到此事，伤心虽不能免，却已足矣。我多么希望马修也能得到那种慰藉，但他却反其道而行之。我已下定决心不表露我的感情，但听到一个人想要把自己的亲人分而食之——就好像他或她是一个巨人——还要赶走他们，这真是太难过了。真是一派胡言！”","“I suppose there’s nothing to be done,” exclaimed Camilla, “but comply and depart.It’s something to have seen the object of one’s love and duty, for even so short a time.I shall think of it with a melancholy satisfaction when I wake up in the night.I wish Matthew could have that comfort, but he sets it at defiance.I am determined not to make a display of my feelings, but it’s very hard to be told one wants to feast on one’s relations—as if one was a Giant—and to be told to go.The bare idea!”"
"卡米拉先生过来将她护送出去。只见卡米拉夫人把手压在起伏的胸前，强装出一副不自然的、坚韧的表情，还对郝维仙小姐飞吻。可是我从她那神情看出她一走到我们看不见的地方就会马上把手拿开、哽咽不已。萨拉·鄱凯特和乔治亚娜较着劲，看谁能最后一个离开。但萨拉狡猾至极，结果略胜一筹。她巧妙、机警地在乔治亚娜旁边慢慢地走来走去，使得乔治亚娜不得不先行一步。萨拉·鄱凯特离开时说，愿上帝保佑您，亲爱的郝维仙小姐！而她那胡桃壳的脸上露出笑容，对别人的弱势表示饶恕和怜悯。","Mr. Camilla interposing, as Mrs. Camilla laid her hand upon her heaving bosom, that lady assumed an unnatural fortitude of manner which I supposed to be expressive of an intention to drop and choke when out of view, and kissing her hand to Miss Havisham, was escorted forth.Sarah Pocket and Georgiana contended who should remain last; but, Sarah was too knowing to be outdone, and ambled round Georgiana with that artful slipperiness, that the latter was obliged to take precedence.Sarah Pocket then made her separate effect of departing with “Bless you, Miss Havisham dear!” and with a smile of forgiving pity on her walnut-shell countenance for the weakness of the rest."
"埃斯特拉拿着蜡烛把他们引下楼，郝维仙小姐继续把手放在我的肩上走着，但脚步越来越慢了。最后，她在火炉前停住，看着炉火喃喃自语了几秒钟，说：“今天是我的生日，皮普。”","While Estella was away lighting them down, Miss Havisham still walked with her hand on my shoulder, but more and more slowly.At last she stopped before the fire, and said, after muttering and looking at it some seconds:“This is my birthday, Pip.”"
"我正要祝她寿比南山，她却举起了手杖。","I was going to wish her many happy returns, when she lifted her stick."
"“我受不了提起这件事。我受不了刚在这里的那些人，或任何人，提起这件事。每到这一天他们都到这里来，但他们不敢说出来。”","“I don’t suffer it to be spoken of.I don’t suffer those who were here just now, or any one, to speak of it.They come here on the day, but they dare not refer to it.”"
"当然，我也就不再设法说这件事了。","Of course I made no further effort to refer to it."
"“有一年的今天，那是在你出生之前很久的一年，这堆垃圾，”她用那根弯曲的手杖指着桌上的那堆蜘蛛网，但并不去碰它，“被送到了这里。我和它一起渐渐衰老。老鼠咬着它，而比老鼠的牙齿更锋利的牙齿咬着我。”","“On this day of the year, long before you were born, this heap of decay,” stabbing with her crutched stick at the pile of cobwebs on the table but not touching it, “was brought here.It and I have worn away together.The mice have gnawed at it, and sharper teeth than teeth of mice have gnawed at me.”"
"她用手杖头抵着自己的胸口，站在那里，盯着桌上的东西。她穿着的那件曾经雪白的礼服，现在已经泛黄、皱缩了，曾经雪白的桌布也都泛黄、皱缩了。周围所有的一切，只要一碰，立即就会碎掉。","She held the head of her stick against her heart as she stood looking at the table; she in her once white dress, all yellow and withered; the once white cloth all yellow and withered; everything around, in a state to crumble under a touch."
"“当我死去的时候，”她露出恐怖的神情说，“当他们把穿着新娘礼服的我放在桌上时——一切都会这样办，一切都会是对他最后的诅咒——最好就在今天！”","“When the ruin is complete,” said she, with a ghastly look, “and when they lay me dead, in my bride’s dress on the bride’s table—which shall be done, and which will be the finished curse upon him—so much the better if it is done on this day!”"
"她站在那里，盯着桌子，就好像站在那里，盯着自己的尸体躺在那里一样。我保持沉默。埃斯特拉回来了，她也保持沉默。我觉得，我们就那样站了好长一段时间。房间里空气污浊不堪，远处的角落里沉淀着浓重的黑暗。我甚至觉得，埃斯特拉和我似乎也开始腐烂了。","She stood looking at the table as if she stood looking at her own figure lying there.I remained quiet.Estella returned, and she too remained quiet.It seemed to me that we continued thus for a long time.In the heavy air of the room, and the heavy darkness that brooded in its remoter corners, I even had an alarming fancy that Estella and I might presently begin to decay."
"最后，郝维仙小姐一下子从这种烦扰的状态恢复了过来，而不是慢慢得到解脱。她说：“让我看看你们两个打牌，为什么你们还不开始呢？”于是，我们回到她的房间，像上次那样坐了下来；像上次一样，我把牌都输光了；像上次一样，郝维仙小姐一直看着我们，设法引起我对埃斯特拉美貌的注意，她把珠宝挂在埃斯特拉的胸前和头发上，让我更加关注埃斯特拉。","At length, not coming out of her distraught state by degrees, but in an instant, Miss Havisham said, “Let me see you two play cards; why have you not begun?”With that, we returned to her room, and sat down as before; I was beggared, as before; and again, as before, Miss Havisham watched us all the time, directed my attention to Estella’s beauty, and made me notice it the more by trying her jewels on Estella’s breast and hair."
"至于埃斯特拉，她也像上次一样对我，但这次她不愿意降低身份跟我说话。我们玩了六局后，我被告知下一次来的时间，然后像上一次一样，像狗一样被带到院子喂食。我又被留在那里随心所欲地游荡。","Estella, for her part, likewise treated me as before; except that she did not condescend to speak.When we had played some halfdozen games, a day was appointed for my return, and I was taken down into the yard to be fed in the former dog-like manner.There, too, I was again left to wander about as I liked."
"上次我曾爬上一面院墙窥探，墙上有一扇门，我并没有太在意那门是开着还是关着的。那时我并没有看到什么门，但这次我看到了一个。门开着，我知道埃斯特拉把客人送走了——因为，她回来时，手里拿着钥匙——我溜进花园，四处晃荡。园子里很荒凉，有一些破旧的香瓜棚架子和黄瓜棚架子，也是极其衰败。几根自然生长出来的藤蔓爬在旧帽子和旧靴子上，不时会有干枯的枝干把一只扁锅当成栖身之地。","It is not much to the purpose whether a gate in that garden wall which I had scrambled up to peep over on the last occasion was, on that last occasion, open or shut.Enough that I saw no gate then, and that I saw one now.As it stood open, and as I knew that Estella had let the visitors out—for, she had returned with the keys in her hand—I strolled into the garden and strolled all over it.It was quite a wilderness, and there were old melon-frames and cucumber-frames in it, which seemed in their decline to have produced a spontaneous growth of weak attempts at pieces of old hats and boots, with now and then a weedy offshoot into the likeness of a battered saucepan."
"逛完花园后，我还看到了一间温室花房，里面什么也没有，只有一棵倒下的葡萄藤和几个瓶子。之后我便发现自己来到了一个阴暗的角落里，也就是刚才我从窗户里向外看时看到的阴暗的角落。我一时间坚定地认为这个花房是空的。我从另外一个窗户望进去时，我吃惊地发现，自己正和一个脸色苍白、眼睑发红、发色偏淡的年轻绅士对视着。","When I had exhausted the garden, and a greenhouse with nothing in it but a fallen-down grape-vine and some bottles, I found myself in the dismal corner upon which I had looked out of the window.Never questioning for a moment that the house was now empty, I looked in at another window, and found myself, to my great surprise, exchanging a broad stare with a pale young gentleman with red eyelids and light hair."
"这位脸色苍白的年轻绅士很快就消失了，一转眼就站在了我旁边。刚才我盯着他看时，他正在看书。现在我看到他满手都是墨迹。","This pale young gentleman quickly disappeared, and re-appeared beside me.He had been at his books when I had found myself staring at him, and I now saw that he was inky."
"“你好啊！”他说，“小家伙！”","“Halloa!” said he, “young fellow!”"
"“你好啊”是一个普通的称呼，据我平时的观察，最好还是依样回答，于是我说：“你好啊！”出于礼貌，我没有说“小家伙”。","Halloa being a general observation which I had usually observed to be best answered by itself, I said, “Halloa!” politely omitting young fellow."
"“谁让你进来的？”他问。","“Who let you in?” said he."
"“埃斯特拉小姐。”","“Miss Estella.”"
"“谁让你四处游荡的？”","“Who gave you leave to prowl about?”"
"“埃斯特拉小姐。”","“Miss Estella.”"
"“来，我们打一架。”这位苍白的年轻绅士说。","“Come and fight,” said the pale young gentleman."
"除了跟他走，我还能怎么办呢？从那以后，我就经常问我自己这个问题：但是，我还能怎么办呢？他的态度很坚决，我吃了一惊。他在前面领路，我在后面跟着，好像自己被施了什么魔法一样。","What could I do but follow him?I have often asked myself the question since: but, what else could I do?His manner was so final and I was so astonished, that I followed where he led, as if I had been under a spell."
"“停一下。”他说，还没走出多少步，他就在旁边转起圈来，“我也应该给你一个打架的理由。这就是！”他立即拍了拍手，表现出很愤怒的样子，优雅地做了个后脚踢，上前拉住我的头发，又拍了拍手，低着头，朝我的胃部冲了过来。","“Stop a minute, though,” he said, wheeling round before we had gone many paces.“I ought to give you a reason for fighting, too.There it is!”In a most irritating manner he instantly slapped his hands against one another, daintily flung one of his legs up behind him, pulled my hair, slapped his hands again, dipped his head, and butted it into my stomach."
"他这种公牛式的行为终于激怒了我，不仅因为这无疑是一种没有礼貌的行为，而且，我刚吃过面包和肉，被他一撞，很不舒服。于是，我打了他一下，正要再打一下时，他说：“哎呀！你敢打我？”然后，他开始前后摇晃起来，我的见识有限，从没见过这类的打架方式。","The bull-like proceeding last mentioned, besides that it was unquestionably to be regarded in the light of a liberty, was particularly disagreeable just after bread and meat.I therefore hit out at him and was going to hit out again, when he said, “Aha!Would you?” and began dancing backwards and forwards in a manner quite unparalleled within my limited experience."
"“打架有打架的规则！”他说道。","“Laws of the game!” said he. "
"讲到这里，他放下左腿，抬起右腿。“规则不能变！”这时，他又放下右腿，抬起左腿。“到场地上来，做些准备活动！”然后，他前后跳来跳去，做着各种奇怪的动作，而我则无助地看着他。","Here, he skipped from his left leg on to his right.“Regular rules!”Here, he skipped from his right leg on to his left.“Come to the ground, and go through the preliminaries!”Here, he dodged backwards and forwards, and did all sorts of things while I looked helplessly at him."
"看到他如此灵活，我暗暗地惧他几分。但是我相信，从道义上和体力上看，我的胃完全可以不被他那一头浅发撞凹下去，我也有权利这么认为，因为他满头的浅发干扰了我的注意力。因此，我一声不吭地跟着他，来到了花园里一个废弃的角落。这里位于两面墙的连接处，一些垃圾把它与外界隔离开来。他问我是否满意这个场地，我回答“是的”。然后他请求离开一会儿，很快就回来了，带着一瓶水和一块泡在醋里的海绵。“我们两个人都可以用。”他说着把东西放在墙边。然后，他开始脱衣服，不仅脱了夹克和外套，连里面的衬衫都脱了。他看起来轻松快乐、有条不紊，却暗藏着杀机。","I was secretly afraid of him when I saw him so dexterous; but, I felt morally and physically convinced that his light head of hair could have had no business in the pit of my stomach, and that I had a right to consider it irrelevant when so obtruded on my attention.Therefore, I followed him without a word, to a retired nook of the garden, formed by the junction of two walls and screened by some rubbish.On his asking me if I was satisfied with the ground, and on my replying Yes, he begged my leave to absent himself for a moment, and quickly returned with a bottle of water and a sponge dipped in vinegar.“Available for both,” he said, placing these against the wall.And then fell to pulling off, not only his jacket and waistcoat, but his shirt too, in a manner at once light-hearted, businesslike, and bloodthirsty."
"尽管他看起来不是很健康——他脸上有青春痘，嘴上还有火疮——但这些可怕的准备活动把我吓呆了。我推测他大概和我年纪相仿，但是比我高多了，而且他有办法让自己旋转起来的时候令人目不暇接。其他方面，他是一位年轻绅士，穿着一套灰色套装（还没有脱衣服打架之前），胳膊肘、膝盖、手腕和脚后跟比他身体的其他部位都要发达。","Although he did not look very healthy—having pimples on his face, and a breaking out at his mouth—these dreadful preparations quite appalled me.I judged him to be about my own age, but he was much taller, and he had a way of spinning himself about that was full of appearance.For the rest, he was a young gentleman in a grey suit (when not denuded for battle), with his elbows, knees, wrists, and heels, considerably in advance of the rest of him as to development."
"我看到他对我展开攻势，每一招都近乎完美。他的眼睛仔细端详我的身体，似乎在精心挑选骨头，我顿时跌入低谷。我的人生中从来没有这样惊讶过，只有这一次：当我打出第一拳时，他立即摔倒在地上，四脚朝天，仰视着我，鼻子流了血，脸急速缩小。","My heart failed me when I saw him squaring at me with every demonstration of mechanical nicety, and eyeing my anatomy as if he were minutely choosing his bone.I never have been so surprised in my life, as I was when I let out the first blow, and saw him lying on his back, looking up at me with a bloody nose and his face exceedingly fore-shortened."
"但他一下子又站了起来，非常熟练地用海绵擦完血后，又开始发起了进攻。这是我人生中遇到的第二大惊奇：他再次仰面躺在地上，用带着黑圆圈的眼睛直直地盯着我。","But, he was on his feet directly, and after sponging himself with a great show of dexterity began squaring again.The second greatest surprise I have ever had in my life was seeing him on his back again, looking up at me out of a black eye."
"他的精神让我很佩服。他似乎没有什么力气，他从来没有用力地打中我一次，而且他经常被打倒。但是，他很快又会站起来，用海绵擦血或喝口瓶子里的水，对依照规则给自己补充体力很是满意，然后又摆起架势朝我打来，让我觉得，最终他肯定会打败我的。他被打得伤痕累累，我很抱歉，因为我打他越多，我就打得越重。可是他一次又一次地站起来，直到最后，他重重地摔倒在地，头撞在了墙上。在我们的战斗中，即使遇到了这种危急情况，他还是站了起来，晕眩地转了几圈，摸不清我在哪里。但最后他终于跪倒在地，一边拿起海绵擦拭，一边喘着气说：“你赢了。”","His spirit inspired me with great respect.He seemed to have no strength, and he never once hit me hard, and he was always knocked down; but, he would be up again in a moment, sponging himself or drinking out of the water-bottle, with the greatest satisfaction in seconding himself according to form, and then came at me with an air and a show that made me believe he really was going to do for me at last.He got heavily bruised, for I am sorry to record that the more I hit him, the harder I hit him; but, he came up again and again and again, until at last he got a bad fall with the back of his head against the wall.Even after that crisis in our affairs, he got up and turned round and round confusedly a few times, not knowing where I was; but finally went on his knees to his sponge and threw it up: at the same time panting out, “That means you have won.”"
"他看起来勇敢又天真，尽管并不是我挑起的这场战斗，但我对自己的胜利毫无满足之感，反而心情很沮丧。实际上，我的心情沮丧到希望我在穿衣服的时候，把自己当成一种年幼的野狼，或着其他野兽。无论如何，我穿好了衣服，不时地擦拭脸上的血渍，说：“我能帮上什么忙吗？”他说：“不用了，谢谢。”我说：“再见。”然后，他说：“再见。”","He seemed so brave and innocent, that although I had not proposed the contest I felt but a gloomy satisfaction in my victory.Indeed, I go so far as to hope that I regarded myself while dressing, as a species of savage young wolf, or other wild beast.However, I got dressed, darkly wiping my sanguinary face at intervals, and I said, “Can I help you?” and he said “No thankee,” and I said “Good afternoon,” and he said “Same to you.”"
"当我走进院子里，我看到埃斯特拉拿着钥匙在等着。可是，她既没有问我去哪里了，也没有问我为什么让她等。她的脸上闪过一丝亮光，似乎发生了什么让她很高兴的事。她没有径直朝门走去，而是走回小道，叫我过去。","When I got into the court-yard, I found Estella waiting with the keys.But, she neither asked me where I had been, nor why I had kept her waiting; and there was a bright flush upon her face, as though something had happened to delight her.Instead of going straight to the gate, too, she stepped back into the passage, and beckoned me."
"“到这里来！如果你愿意的话，可以吻我一下。”","“Come here!You may kiss me, if you like.”"
"她转过脸时，我吻了一下她的脸颊。我想，只要能吻一下她的脸颊，我可以赴汤蹈火，在所不辞。但是，现在我却觉得，这个吻就像是给粗鄙的普通男孩的一个小钱，一文不值。","I kissed her cheek as she turned it to me.I think I would have gone through a great deal to kiss her cheek.But, I felt that the kiss was given to the coarse common boy as a piece of money might have been, and that it was worth nothing."
"这一天，我遇到了来祝贺生日的客人，和埃斯特拉打了牌，和年轻绅士打了架，在那里呆了很长时间。因此，当我快到家时，沼泽边延伸出的沙滩上矗立着的那座灯塔已经在黑暗的夜空中发光了，而乔打铁溅出的火星，也在路上形成了一道火花。","What with the birthday visitors, and what with the cards, and what with the fight, my stay had lasted so long, that when I neared home the light on the spit of sand off the point on the marshes was gleaming against a black night-sky, and Joe’s furnace was flinging a path of fire across the road."
"第十二章","Chapter 12"
"和那位脸色苍白的年轻绅士打架的事情一直让我心神不宁。我越是想到这次打架，回忆起那位脸色苍白的年轻绅士被屡次摔得四脚朝天、鼻青脸肿的样子，我就越是感到自己似乎会受到某种惩罚。我能感到，那位脸色苍白的年轻绅士的血洒在了我头上，而法律会惩罚我的。我不知道自己具体犯了什么罪，但是我很清楚地知道，乡下孩子不能在外面晃荡，不能蹂躏贵族的宅邸，不能冒犯好学的英国少年，否则，他面临的就是严厉的惩罚。一连几天，我都呆在家里。有事出门时，我都要从厨房的门向外仔细探查一番，心里非常害怕，担心一出门就会被郡监狱的官差抓去。那位脸色苍白的年轻绅士的鼻血染红了我的裤子。我在深夜里费劲把这个罪证洗掉了。那位脸色苍白的年轻绅士用牙齿咬破了我的手指，我绞尽脑汁，想出了一千种解释。这样，万一我被抓到了法官面前，我就能巧言诡辩，把这件该死的事掩饰过去。","My mind grew very uneasy on the subject of the pale young gentleman.The more I thought of the fight, and recalled the pale young gentleman on his back in various stages of puffy and incrimsoned countenance, the more certain it appeared that something would be done to me.I felt that the pale young gentleman’s blood was on my head, and that the Law would avenge it.Without having any definite idea of the penalties I had incurred, it was clear to me that village boys could not go stalking about the country, ravaging the houses of gentlefolks and pitching into the studious youth of England, without laying themselves open to severe punishment.For some days, I even kept close at home, and looked out at the kitchen door with the greatest caution and trepidation before going on an errand, lest the officers of the County Jail should pounce upon me.The pale young gentleman’s nose had stained my trousers, and I tried to wash out that evidence of my guilt in the dead of night.I had cut my knuckles against the pale young gentleman’s teeth, and I twisted my imagination into a thousand tangles, as I devised incredible ways of accounting for that damnatory circumstance when I should be haled before the Judges."
"在我又回到暴力施行现场的那一天，我的恐惧达到了最高点。伦敦特派的法院人员会不会埋伏在门后面呢？郝维仙小姐会不会因为我在她家打人，就要亲手报复呢？她会+B18不会穿着寿衣突然站起来，抽出手枪打死我呢？她会不会雇一帮孩子——一群杀人恶魔——躲在酿酒作坊里，突然跳出来，把我打死呢？我相信那位脸色苍白的年轻绅士是高尚的，他不会叫人报复的。但是我总是担心他那些不明事理+B21的亲戚，看到他的脸伤得那么重，他们会觉得家庭的声誉受损，肯定会非常气愤。","When the day came round for my return to the scene of the deed of violence, my terrors reached their height.Whether myrmidons of Justice, specially sent down from London, would be lying in ambush behind the gate?Whether Miss Havisham, preferring to take personal vengeance for an outrage done to her house, might rise in those grave-clothes of hers, draw a pistol, and shoot me dead?Whether suborned boys—a numerous band of mercenaries—might be engaged to fall upon me in the brewery, and cuff me until I was no more?It was high testimony to my confidence in the spirit of the pale young gentleman, that I never imagined him accessory to these retaliations; they always came into my mind as the acts of injudicious relatives of his, goaded on by the state of his visage and an indignant sympathy with the family features."
"然而，我必须到郝维仙小姐家里去，而我也真的去了。瞧！上次的打架并没有引起什么骚动。没有人提到那件事。我找遍整座宅邸，也没有找到那位脸色苍白的年轻绅士。我发现那扇门还开着，就走进去探查。我甚至还从这座独立的花房的窗户向里望去，却只看到里面的百叶窗都关着，死气沉沉的。只有上次我们打架的那个地方还有一些痕迹，证明真的有那么一位年轻的绅士。他在那里留下了一些血迹，我从花园里挖了一些泥土，铺在上面，以防被别人发现。","However, go to Miss Havisham’s I must, and go I did.And behold!Nothing came of the late struggle.It was not alluded to in any way, and no pale young gentleman was to be discovered on the premises.I found the same gate open, and I explored the garden, and even looked in at the windows of the detached house; but, my view was suddenly stopped by the closed shutters within, and all was lifeless.Only in the corner where the combat had taken place, could I detect any evidence of the young gentleman’s existence.There were traces of his gore in that spot, and I covered them with garden-mould from the eye of man."
"在郝维仙小姐的屋子和那间放着长桌子的屋子之间，我看到一个宽敞的平台，上面有一张庭院椅——椅子下面有轮子，可以从后面往前推，很轻便。上次我来时，这椅子就放在那里。那天我在进行日常工作的时候进过那个房间。所谓日常工作就是当郝维仙小姐感到疲惫，不想用手扶着我的肩膀走路的时候，就会坐到那个庭院椅上，让我推着她在自己房间里绕圈，然后穿过平台，又在另一个屋子里绕圈。我们绕了一圈又一圈，有时候一次就要绕上三个小时。渐渐地，我也数不清绕了多少圈。因为从那天起，我就要每隔一天去给她推一次椅子，时间是在中午。现在数数，我至少干了八或十个月。","On the broad landing between Miss Havisham’s own room and that other room in which the long table was laid out, I saw a garden-chair—a light chair on wheels, that you pushed from behind.It had been placed there since my last visit, and I entered, that same day, on a regular occupation of pushing Miss Havisham in this chair (when she was tired of walking with her hand upon my shoulder) round her own room, and across the landing, and round the other room.Over and over and over again, we would make these journeys, and sometimes they would last as long as three hours at a stretch.I insensibly fall into a general mention of these journeys as numerous, because it was at once settled that I should return every alternate day at noon for these purposes, and because I am now going to sum up a period of at least eight or ten months."
"随着我们开始越来越习惯彼此，郝维仙小姐和我交谈得也就更多了。她会问我学到了什么，将来要做什么，以及诸如此类的问题。我告诉她，我相信自己会成为乔的学徒，而且我什么也不懂，可什么都想知道，我希望她能给我提供一些帮助，达成我的愿望。但她没有，她看起来反而更希望我无知。她既没有给过我钱——除了每天那顿饭之外，也没有给过我任何东西——更没有保证说，要为我提供的服务支付报酬。","As we began to be more used to one another, Miss Havisham talked more to me, and asked me such questions as what had I learnt and what was I going to be?I told her I was going to be apprenticed to Joe, I believed; and I enlarged upon my knowing nothing and wanting to know everything, in the hope that she might offer some help towards that desirable end.But, she did not; on the contrary, she seemed to prefer my being ignorant.Neither did she ever give me any money—or anything but my daily dinner—nor ever stipulate that I should be paid for my services."
"埃斯特拉总是在周围，总是带着我进进出出，却再也没有叫我吻她了。有时，她会冷冷地宽容我；有时，她会降低身份迁就我；有时，她表现得和我很亲近；有时，她会愤怒地跟我说，她恨我。郝维仙小姐常常轻声问我，或者趁只有我们两个人的时候说：“她是不是越长越漂亮了呢，皮普？”要是我回答“是的”（因为她真的越长越漂亮了），郝维仙小姐会很高兴。还有，我们打牌时，郝维仙小姐会打量埃斯特拉，贪婪地品味着她所有的情绪变化。有时，埃斯特拉情绪复杂、反复无常，我不知道该说什么或做什么，郝维仙小姐就会非常高兴地把她抱进怀里，在她耳边喃喃低语，听起来好像是在说：“让他们心碎，我的骄傲和希望，让他们心碎，别可怜他们！”","Estella was always about, and always let me in and out, but never told me I might kiss her again.Sometimes, she would coldly tolerate me; sometimes, she would condescend to me; sometimes, she would be quite familiar with me; sometimes, she would tell me energetically that she hated me.Miss Havisham would often ask me in a whisper, or when we were alone, “Does she grow prettier and prettier, Pip?”And when I said yes (for indeed she did), would seem to enjoy it greedily.Also, when we played at cards Miss Havisham would look on, with a miserly relish of Estella’s moods, whatever they were.And sometimes, when her moods were so many and so contradictory of one another that I was puzzled what to say or do, Miss Havisham would embrace her with lavish fondness, murmuring something in her ear that sounded like “Break their hearts my pride and hope, break their hearts and have no mercy!”"
"乔在铁匠铺里的时候，喜欢断断续续地反复哼唱一首歌，歌名叫作《老克莱门之歌》。用这种方式来表达对守护圣徒的尊重，是不够庄重的。但是，我相信，这首歌确切地表现了老克莱门和铁匠们的关系。这首歌模仿铁匠打铁的方法，充满感情地唱出了老克莱门那受人尊敬的名字。例如：“孩子们一起来打铁啊，老克莱门！打一下啊，敲一声，老克莱门！使劲敲啊，使劲敲啊，老克莱门！用力拉风箱啊，老克莱门！旺旺地把火烧啊，老克莱门！风箱的声音吼啊，火苗窜得高啊，老克莱门！”有一天，我刚开始用椅子推郝维仙小姐的时候，她突然不耐烦地挥动着手指说道：“行了，行了，行了！唱首歌吧！”我很惊讶，但还是一边推着她，一边低声地哼唱起小曲来。她被我的小曲吸引住了，也跟着我轻轻地哼唱起来，就好像在梦中哼唱一样。从此以后，一边在屋子里绕圈，一边哼歌成了我们的习惯。埃斯特拉也经常加入我们的行列。我们把声音压得很低，所以即便是三个人的时候，我们在这座阴暗的老房子里发出的声音也比微风更轻、更低。","There was a song Joe used to hum fragments of at the forge, of which the burden was Old Clem.This was not a very ceremonious way of rendering homage to a patron saint; but, I believe Old Clem stood in that relation towards smiths.It was a song that imitated the measure of beating upon iron, and was a mere lyrical excuse for the introduction of Old Clem’s respected name.Thus, you were to hammer boys round—Old Clem!With a thump and a sound—Old Clem!Beat it out, beat it out—Old Clem!With a clink for the stout—Old Clem!Blow the fire, blow the fire—Old Clem!Roaring dryer, soaring higher—Old Clem!One day soon after the appearance of the chair, Miss Havisham suddenly saying to me, with the impatient movement of her fingers, “There, there, there!Sing!”I was surprised into crooning this ditty as I pushed her over the floor.It happened so to catch her fancy, that she took it up in a low brooding voice as if she were singing in her sleep.After that, it became customary with us to have it as we moved about, and Estella would often join in; though the whole strain was so subdued, even when there were three of us, that it made less noise in the grim old house than the lightest breath of wind."
"在这样的环境中，我将成为一个什么样的人呢？我的性格怎能不受她们的影响呢？当我从那些阴暗、昏黄的房间里走出来，进入到大自然的光芒之中的时候，我怎能不晕眩、迷茫呢？","What could I become with these surroundings?How could my character fail to be influenced by them?Is it to be wondered at if my thoughts were dazed, as my eyes were, when I came out into the natural light from the misty yellow rooms?"
"如果当初我没有违背事实来编造出离谱的谎言的话，我或许会告诉乔有关那个脸色苍白的年轻绅士的事。可是如果现在说了，我觉得乔肯定会以为，这位脸色苍白的年轻绅士不过是黑色天鹅绒马车里的一个乘客而已。因此，我什么都没有对他说。况且，刚开始我就很害怕谈起郝维仙小姐和埃斯特拉，而随着时间的流逝，我的这种害怕越来越强烈。除了比迪之外，我谁也不能完全相信，所以我把所有的事情都告诉了可怜的比迪。当时我并不知道，为什么我能够很自然地相信比迪，为什么比迪对我的每一件事都很关心。但我想，我现在明白了。","Perhaps, I might have told Joe about the pale young gentleman, if I had not previously been betrayed into those enormous inventions to which I had confessed.Under the circumstances, I felt that Joe could hardly fail to discern in the pale young gentleman, an appropriate passenger to be put into the black velvet coach; therefore, I said nothing of him.Besides: that shrinking from having Miss Havisham and Estella discussed, which had come upon me in the beginning, grew much more potent as time went on.I reposed complete confidence in no one but Biddy; but, I told poor Biddy everything.Why it came natural to me to do so, and why Biddy had a deep concern in everything I told her, I did not know then, though I think I know now."
"此时，家中的厨房里正在召开家庭会议。我非常恼火，几乎到达了无法控制的地步。晚上，彭波契克那个坏蛋常来跟我姐姐讨论我的前途。我真的确信（至今想起来，仍然不会后悔），如果我的手有足够的力气，我一定会把他轻便马车上的轮辖拔出来。那个令人讨厌的人迟钝而又固执，他讨论我前途的时候，总是要我在他跟前，似乎要在我身上做实验一样。我原本是安静地坐在角落里，他把我从椅子上拽起来（通常用手拽衣领），放在炉火前，仿佛要把我烤熟，然后开始说：“瞧，夫人，就是这个孩子。这就是你一手带大的孩子。抬起头来，孩子，你可一辈子都要感激把你养大的人啊。那么，夫人，来谈谈这个孩子吧！”然后，他会弄乱我的头发——我在前面已经说过了，从我记事起他就会这样，而我认为谁也没有权利弄乱我的头发——接着，他还会扯着我的袖子，把我拉到他面前，让我出洋相，显得很愚钝，就像他自己那样。","Meanwhile, councils went on in the kitchen at home, fraught with almost insupportable aggravation to my exasperated spirit.That ass, Pumblechook, used often to come over of a night for the purpose of discussing my prospects with my sister; and I really do believe (to this hour with less penitence than I ought to feel), that if these hands could have taken a linchpin out of his chaise-cart, they would have done it.The miserable man was a man of that confined stolidity of mind, that he could not discuss my prospects without having me before him—as it were, to operate upon—and he would drag me up from my stool (usually by the collar) where I was quiet in a corner, and, putting me before the fire as if I were going to be cooked, would begin by saying, “Now, Mum, here is this boy!Here is this boy which you brought up by hand.Hold up your head, boy, and be for ever grateful unto them which so did do.Now, Mum, with respections to this boy!”And then he would rumple my hair the wrong way—which from my earliest remembrance, as already hinted, I have in my soul denied the right of any fellow-creature to do—and would hold me before him by the sleeve: a spectacle of imbecility only to be equaled by himself."
"然后，他和我姐姐就会一唱一和，谈论和郝维仙小姐有关的事，以及郝维仙小姐应该为我做什么、想什么。一听到这里，我就非常痛苦，想流出痛恨的眼泪，想冲到彭波契克跟前，把他全身上下狠狠地揍一顿。在这些对话当中，我姐姐和我说话的样子就像每提起我一次就要拔我一颗牙齿一样。而彭波契克则自封为我的恩惠者，洋洋得意地坐在那里，不屑地监督着我的举动，仿佛是我好运的缔造者。他觉得为我做了那么多的事，自己却什么好处都没有得到，这不公平。","Then, he and my sister would pair off in such nonsensical speculations about Miss Havisham, and about what she would do with me and for me, that I used to want—quite painfully—to burst into spiteful tears, fly at Pumblechook, and pummel him all over.In these dialogues, my sister spoke to me as if she were morally wrenching one of my teeth out at every reference; while Pumblechook himself, self-constituted my patron, would sit supervising me with a depreciatory eye, like the architect of my fortunes who thought himself engaged on a very unremunerative job."
"乔从来不参与他们的讨论。不过，他们倒是常常和他谈，因为乔太太已经察觉到，乔不赞成我离开铁匠铺。我现在长大了，已经可以给乔做学徒了。当乔把火钳放在膝盖上坐着，若有所思地拨弄着火炉下层的煤灰时，我姐姐便会把这种无辜的行为直接当作是反抗的表现，扑向他，从他手里夺下火钳，使劲地摇晃他的身体，然后把火钳扔掉。每回谈起这类问题，都会落个不愉快的下场。一时没有新的话题了，我姐姐便会停住，打个哈欠，然后突然不经意地看到我似的，朝我扑过来：“够了！没你的事了！你去睡觉吧。你这一晚上可真让人心烦的了！”这就好像是我请求他们来烦扰我的生活似的。","In these discussions, Joe bore no part.But he was often talked at, while they were in progress, by reason of Mrs. Joe’s perceiving that he was not favorable to my being taken from the forge.I was fully old enough now, to be apprenticed to Joe; and when Joe sat with the poker on his knees thoughtfully raking out the ashes between the lower bars, my sister would so distinctly construe that innocent action into opposition on his part, that she would dive at him, take the poker out of his hands, shake him, and put it away.There was a most irritating end to every one of these debates.All in a moment, with nothing to lead up to it, my sister would stop herself in a yawn, and catching sight of me as it were incidentally, would swoop upon me with, “Come! there’s enough of you!You get along to bed; you’ve given trouble enough for one night, I hope!”As if I had besought them as a favor to bother my life out."
"我们就这样过了很长一段时间，而且看起来，我们还得接着这样过很长一段时间。有一天，郝维仙小姐正用手扶着我的肩膀走路时，她停了下来，不太愉快地跟我说：“你长高了，皮普！”","We went on in this way for a long time, and it seemed likely that we should continue to go on in this way for a long time, when, one day, Miss Havisham stopped short as she and I were walking, she leaning on my shoulder; and said with some displeasure:“You are growing tall, Pip!”"
"我满脸深思地看了她一眼，认为用这种方式来传递信息是最好的方法，让她明白这是自然的规律，我无法操纵。","I thought it best to hint, through the medium of a meditative look, that this might be occasioned by circumstances over which I had no control."
"当时，她并没有多说什么。但过了一会儿，她又停了下来打量着我，再过一会儿又看着我，愁容满面，心情抑郁。下次我去服侍她时，跟平常一样做完运动后，我扶着她来到化妆台前，她不耐烦地晃了晃手指，说：“再告诉我一次，你那个铁匠叫什么名字？”","She said no more at the time; but, she presently stopped and looked at me again; and presently again; and after that, looked frowning and moody.On the next day of my attendance when our usual exercise was over, and I had landed her at her dressing table, she stayed me with a movement of her impatient fingers:“Tell me the name again of that blacksmith of yours.”"
"“乔·格雷戈里，夫人。”","“Joe Gargery, ma’am.”"
"“你就是要给这个师父当学徒吗？”","“Meaning the master you were to be apprenticed to?”"
"“是的，郝维仙小姐。”","“Yes, Miss Havisham.”"
"“你最好立刻就去当学徒。你觉得，格雷戈里会带着你们的师徒契约跟你一起到这里来吗？”","“You had better be apprenticed at once.Would Gargery come here with you, and bring your indentures, do you think?”"
"我表示，要是他受到邀请的话，他肯定会觉得非常荣幸的。","I signified that I had no doubt he would take it as an honor to be asked."
"“那就让他来吧”","“Then let him come.”"
"“什么时候来呢，郝维仙小姐？”","“At any particular time, Miss Havisham?”"
"“行啦，行啦！我对时间一无所知。让他尽快和你一道来吧。”","“There, there!I know nothing about times.Let him come soon, and come along with you.”"
"当晚我回家后，跟乔说了这件事，我姐姐却大发雷霆，比先前任何一次都要生气。她质问我和乔，是不是把她当成了门口的蹭脚垫，可以随意践踏；我们怎么敢如此对待她；我们把她看成了什么人？当她一连串地抛出一大堆问题后，拿过烛台朝乔扔了过去，接着便放声大哭起来。她还把簸箕拿了出来——这一向不是一个好的预兆——+B125围上粗布围裙，开始发疯地打扫起来。单是打扫还不够，她还提来一桶水，拿来一个拖把，把我们扫出了屋子，我们只好在院子里浑身颤抖地站着。直到晚上十点，我们才冒险溜进去，然后，我姐姐就问乔为什么不干脆立刻娶一个女黑奴。乔没有回答，可怜巴巴地站在那里，用手抓着自己的胡子，沮丧地看着我，好像在想，说不定娶个女黑奴倒是个不错的想法。","When I got home at night, and delivered this message for Joe, my sister “went on the Rampage,” in a more alarming degree than at any previous period.She asked me and Joe whether we supposed she was door-mats under our feet, and how we dared to use her so, and what company we graciously thought she was fit for?When she had exhausted a torrent of such inquiries, she threw a candlestick at Joe, burst into a loud sobbing, got out the dustpan—which was always a very bad sign—put on her coarse apron, and began cleaning up to a terrible extent.Not satisfied with a dry cleaning, she took to a pail and scrubbing-brush, and cleaned us out of house and home, so that we stood shivering in the back-yard.It was ten o’clock at night before we ventured to creep in again, and then she asked Joe why he hadn’t married a Negress Slave at once?Joe offered no answer, poor fellow, but stood feeling his whisker and looking dejectedly at me, as if he thought it really might have been a better speculation."
"第十三章","Chapter 13"
"第三天，乔穿着那套节日礼服，仔细打扮了一番，准备和我一起去拜访郝维仙小姐。我看着他的衣服，心里很不舒服。但他觉得，必要的时候是一定要穿上这套衣服的。我没有告诉他，他平时穿着工作服的样子比现在好看多了。因为我知道，他把自己弄得如此糟糕完全是为了我。为了我，他把衬衫后面的领子竖得很高，让头发像一撮羽毛一样站得直直的。","It was a trial to my feelings, on the next day but one, to see Joe arraying himself in his Sunday clothes to accompany me to Miss Havisham’s.However, as he thought his court-suit necessary to the occasion, it was not for me tell him that he looked far better in his working dress; the rather, because I knew he made himself so dreadfully uncomfortable, entirely on my account, and that it was for me he pulled up his shirt-collar so very high behind, that it made the hair on the crown of his head stand up like a tuft of feathers."
"吃早餐的时候，姐姐宣布要和我们一起去镇里，然后留在彭波契克叔叔家里，等我们和那位贵夫人完事之后，再到那里去找她。她说话的样子，好像乔就要倒大霉了一样。今天铁匠铺不开工，乔用粉笔在门上（他很少不工作，但一旦停工，他总要这么做）写了一个单音节的字“出”，还画了一支箭，仿佛正朝着他离开的方向飞去。","At breakfast time my sister declared her intention of going to town with us, and being left at Uncle Pumblechook’s and called for “when we had done with our fine ladies”—a way of putting the case, from which Joe appeared inclined to augur the worst.The forge was shut up for the day, and Joe inscribed in chalk upon the door (as it was his custom to do on the very rare occasions when he was not at work) the monosyllable HOUT, accompanied by a sketch of an arrow supposed to be flying in the direction he had taken."
"我们走着去镇里，姐姐在前面带路。她戴着一顶海狸皮大帽子，挎着一只看起来像英国国玺的草编篮子，穿着一双套鞋，围着一条罕见的披肩，还拿着一把伞，尽管天气很晴朗。我不知道她带这么多东西是为了修苦行，还是为了炫耀。但是，我想应该是为了展现财富——就像埃及艳后克丽奥佩特拉或者任意一位掌权的女士一样，总喜欢在游行的时候展示自己的财富。","We walked to town, my sister leading the way in a very large beaver bonnet, and carrying a basket like the Great Seal of England in plaited straw, a pair of pattens, a spare shawl, and an umbrella, though it was a fine bright day.I am not quite clear whether these articles were carried penitentially or ostentatiously; but, I rather think they were displayed as articles of property—much as Cleopatra or any other sovereign lady on the Rampage might exhibit her wealth in a pageant or procession."
"到达彭波契克家门口后，姐姐就丢下我们，蹦蹦跳跳地走了进去。此时已经快到中午了，乔和我径直往郝维仙小姐的家里走去。埃斯特拉像平常一样开了门，乔一看到她，就脱下帽子，双手抓住帽檐，掂量着。仿佛他心里正焦急地想，一定要锱铢必较。","When we came to Pumblechook’s, my sister bounced in and left us.As it was almost noon, Joe and I held straight on to Miss Havisham’s house.Estella opened the gate as usual, and, the moment she appeared, Joe took his hat off and stood weighing it by the brim in both his hands: as if he had some urgent reason in his mind for being particular to half a quarter of an ounce."
"埃斯特拉理都没理我们，只是带着我们走着那条我极为熟悉的路。我紧紧地跟在她后面，乔走在最后。当我在长长的过道里回头看乔时，他还在小心翼翼地掂量着那顶帽子，踮起脚尖大步走在我们后面。","Estella took no notice of either of us, but led us the way that I knew so well.I followed next to her, and Joe came last.When I looked back at Joe in the long passage, he was still weighing his hat with the greatest care, and was coming after us in long strides on the tips of his toes."
"埃斯特拉叫我们两个进去，于是我拉着乔的袖子走了进去，把他引到郝维仙小姐面前。郝维仙小姐坐在梳妆台旁，立刻转过头来盯着我们看。","Estella told me we were both to go in, so I took Joe by the coat-cuff and conducted him into Miss Havisham’s presence.She was seated at her dressing-table, and looked round at us immediately."
"“噢！”她对乔说，“你就是这个孩子的姐夫吗？”","“Oh!” said she to Joe.“You are the husband of the sister of this boy?”"
"我难以想象，亲爱的老家伙乔看起来简直不像他自己了，或者说就像一只奇怪的鸟，站在那里一句话也不说，头顶上的羽毛直直地站着，嘴巴大张着，似乎要吃虫。","I could hardly have imagined dear old Joe looking so unlike himself or so like some extraordinary bird; standing, as he did, speechless, with his tuft of feathers ruffled, and his mouth open, as if he wanted a worm."
"“你是，”郝维仙小姐重复了一遍，“这个孩子的姐夫吗？”","“You are the husband,” repeated Miss Havisham, “of the sister of this boy?”"
"多令人生气啊！但是，在整个拜访过程中，乔坚持要对着我说话，而不是直接跟郝维仙小姐说话。","It was very aggravating; but, throughout the interview Joe persisted in addressing Me instead of Miss Havisham."
"“我的意思是，皮普，”现在乔表现得非常有说服力，信心十足，也很有礼貌，“当我娶你姐姐的时候，被人们叫做（如果你想这么叫的话）一个单身男人。”","“Which I meantersay, Pip,” Joe now observed in a manner that was at once expressive of forcible argumentation, strict confidence, and great politeness, “as I hup and married your sister, and I were at the time what you might call (if you was anyways inclined) a single man.”"
"“好吧！”郝维仙小姐说，“你抚养了这个孩子，想让他成为你的学徒，是不是，格雷戈里先生？”","“Well!” said Miss Havisham.“And you have reared the boy, with the intention of taking him for your apprentice; is that so, Mr. Gargery?”"
"“你知道，皮普，”乔回答说，“因为你和我永远都是朋友，我们俩都盼望着那一天，希望那一天能给我们带来好运。但是，皮普，如果你对干这一行有任何反对意见——比如说它会把人弄得满身黑尘之类的——并不是没有人理会你的反对意见，你明白吗？”","“You know, Pip,” replied Joe, “as you and me were ever friends, and it were looked for’ard to betwixt us, as being calc’lated to lead to larks.Not but what, Pip, if you had ever made objections to the business—such as its being open to black and sut, or such-like—not but what they would have been attended to, don’t you see?”"
"“这个孩子，”郝维仙小姐说，“有没有提出过任何反对意见？　他喜欢干这一行吗？”","“Has the boy,” said Miss Havisham, “ever made any objection?Does he like the trade?”"
"“你自己最清楚这一点了，皮普，”乔回答道，他的神态比之前更加有说服力，更加信心十足，也更加有礼貌了，“你知道，这是你自己心底的愿望。”（我发现，在他继续说下去之前，他突然意识到可以把自己写的墓志铭用到这个场合中来。）“你没有提出过任何反对意见，皮普，这是你心里最大的愿望！”","“Which it is well beknown to yourself, Pip,” returned Joe, strengthening his former mixture of argumentation, confidence, and politeness, “that it were the wish of your own hart.”(I saw the idea suddenly break upon him that he would adapt his epitaph to the occasion, before he went on to say) “And there weren’t no objection on your part, and Pip it were the great wish of your heart!”"
"我努力想让他明白，他应该直接对着郝维仙小姐讲话，但我的一切努力都白费了。我越是用表情和手势对他示意，他就越是坚持以更加有信心，更加有说服力，更加有礼貌的方式对着我说。","It was quite in vain for me to endeavour to make him sensible that he ought to speak to Miss Havisham.The more I made faces and gestures to him to do it, the more confidential, argumentative, and polite, he persisted in being to Me."
"“你把他的师徒契约带来了吗？”郝维仙小姐问道。","“Have you brought his indentures with you?” asked Miss Havisham. "
"“哦，皮普，你知道，”乔回答道，仿佛觉得这个问题有点荒唐，“你亲眼看见我把它们放进我的帽子里了，所以你知道，它们就在这里了。”说着，他把它们拿了出来，没有递给郝维仙小姐，而是递给了我。我恐怕自己为这位亲爱的老朋友感到丢脸——我知道，我的确为他感到丢脸——当时，我看到埃斯特拉站在郝维仙小姐的椅子后面，她的眼睛里流露出恶意的笑容。我从他手中接过师徒契约，把它们递给了郝维仙小姐。","“Well, Pip, you know,” replied Joe, as if that were a little unreasonable, “you yourself see me put ’em in my ’at, and therefore you know as they are here.”With which he took them out, and gave them, not to Miss Havisham, but to me.I am afraid I was ashamed of the dear good fellow—I know I was ashamed of him—when I saw that Estella stood at the back of Miss Havisham’s chair, and that her eyes laughed mischievously.I took the indentures out of his hand and gave them to Miss Havisham."
"“你打算，”郝维仙小姐看完契约后说道，“不要这个孩子的谢师礼？”","“You expected,” said Miss Havisham, as she looked them over, “no premium with the boy?”"
"“乔！”我对乔表示抗议，因为他根本就不回话，“你为什么不回答——”","“Joe!” I remonstrated; for he made no reply at all.“Why don’t you answer—”"
"“皮普，”乔回答道，他打断了我的话，仿佛刚刚的话让他很伤心，“我的意思是，对我们俩来说，那根本就是一个不需要回答的问题。你知道，答案肯定是不要。你知道，答案肯定是不要，皮普，那我为何还要说什么呢？”","“Pip,” returned Joe, cutting me short as if he were hurt, “which I meantersay that were not a question requiring a answer betwixt yourself and me, and which you know the answer to be full well No.You know it to be No, Pip, and wherefore should I say it?”"
"郝维仙小姐迅速地看了他一眼，仿佛她已经明白了他到底是怎样的一个人，看清了他的本质，也许了解得比我之前所想的更清楚。然后她从身旁的桌子上拿起一个小袋子。","Miss Havisham glanced at him as if she understood what he really was, better than I had thought possible, seeing what he was there; and took up a little bag from the table beside her."
"“皮普在这里赚了一笔谢师礼，”她说，“这就是。这个袋子里有二十五个几尼。把它给你师父，皮普。”","“Pip has earned a premium here,” she said, “and here it is.There are five-and-twenty guineas in this bag.Give it to your master, Pip.”"
"乔仿佛是被她奇怪的体态和这个陌生的房间给彻底惊呆了，他神智不清，即使在这个时候，还是坚持对着我说。","As if he were absolutely out of his mind with the wonder awakened in him by her strange figure and the strange room, Joe, even at this pass, persisted in addressing me."
"“你太慷慨了，皮普，”乔说，“那我就非常感激、非常高兴地收下了，尽管我从来没有期望过要收到这笔钱，从来没有。好了，老弟，”乔说道，他的这句话让我产生了一种强烈的感觉，先是火烧般的灼热感，然后又全身发冷，因为我感觉他仿佛是在用这个亲密的称呼喊郝维仙小姐，“好了，老弟，希望我们能尽到我们的职责！希望你和我能尽到我们的职责，为了我们两个，也为了你慷慨的礼金所要表达的——为了精神上的满足——它们从未——”说到这里，乔感到自己遇到了极大的困难，直到他用这最后一句话成功地解救了自己，“而且我从来就没有想过要这笔礼金！”这句话在他听来如此的字正腔圆，令人信服，所以他说了两遍。","“This is wery liberal on your part, Pip,” said Joe, “and it is as such received and grateful welcome, though never looked for, far nor near nor nowheres.And now, old chap,” said Joe, conveying to me a sensation, first of burning and then of freezing, for I felt as if that familiar expression were applied to Miss Havisham; “and now, old chap, may we do our duty!May you and me do our duty, both on us by one and another, and by them which your liberal present—have—conweyed—to be—for the satisfaction of mind—of—them as never—” here Joe showed that he felt he had fallen into frightful difficulties, until he triumphantly rescued himself with the words, “and from myself far be it!”These words had such a round and convincing sound for him that he said them twice."
"“再见，皮普！”郝维仙小姐说，“带他们出去，埃斯特拉。”","“Good-bye, Pip!” said Miss Havisham. “Let them out, Estella.”"
"“我还要再来吗，郝维仙小姐？”我问道。","“Am I to come again, Miss Havisham?” I asked."
"“不用了。现在格雷戈里是你的师父了。格雷戈里！我要和你说一句话！”","“No.Gargery is your master now.Gargery!One word!”"
"于是当我走出房门的时候，他被叫了回去。我听到她用清晰、着重的语气对乔说：“这个孩子在这里一直表现很好，那是给他的奖赏。当然，作为一个诚实的人，你不会再要别的，也不会再要得更多了。”","Thus calling him back as I went out of the door, I heard her say to Joe, in a distinct emphatic voice, “The boy has been a good boy here, and that is his reward.Of course, as an honest man, you will expect no other and no more.”"
"我一直都无法确定乔是如何走出那个房间的。但是，我知道的是，当他走出那个房间之后，他稳步地朝楼上走去，而不是往楼下走，而且完全听不见我喊他，直到最后我追上去，抓住了他。不一会儿我们就来到了大门外，埃斯特拉锁上大门之后便离开了。","How Joe got out of the room, I have never been able to determine; but, I know that when he did get out he was steadily proceeding up-stairs instead of coming down, and was deaf to all remonstrances until I went after him and laid hold of him.In another minute we were outside the gate, and it was locked, and Estella was gone."
"当我们两个人再一次站在阳光下时，乔背靠在一面墙上，对我说：“太令人吃惊了！”他就这样在那里倚靠了很长一段时间，不时地说一句“太令人吃惊了！”。他不停地说，让我开始觉得他的神智再也清醒不过来了。最后，他延长了自己的这句评论，变成了：“皮普，我向你保证，这真是太令人吃惊了！”就这样，逐渐地，他开始能说话了，也能够走路了。","When we stood in the daylight alone again, Joe backed up against a wall, and said to me, “Astonishing!”And there he remained so long, saying “Astonishing” at intervals, so often, that I began to think his senses were never coming back.At length he prolonged his remark into “Pip, I do assure you this is astonishing!” and so, by degrees, became conversational and able to walk away."
"我有理由相信，经过刚刚的那次经历，乔的智力得到了增长。在我们去彭波契克家的路上，他想出了一个精明巧妙、意义深远的主意。彭波契克先生家的客厅里所发生的事情说明这个主意是多么合乎情理。当我们出现在那里的时候，我姐姐正和那个令人厌恶的种子商人坐着聊天。","I have reason to think that Joe’s intellects were brightened by the encounter they had passed through, and that on our way to Pumblechook’s he invented a subtle and deep design.My reason is to be found in what took place in Mr. Pumblechook’s parlour: where, on our presenting ourselves, my sister sat in conference with that detested seedsman."
"“怎么样？”我姐姐马上对我们两个人喊道，“你们两个怎么样了？我没想到你们会降低身份回到这样穷酸的地方，我真没想到！”","“Well?” cried my sister, addressing us both at once.“And what’s happened to you?I wonder you condescend to come back to such poor society as this, I am sure I do!”"
"“郝维仙小姐，”乔一面说，一面盯着我，好像想努力记起什么似的，“特意嘱咐我们代她向你——是问好还是致意，皮普？”","“Miss Havisham,” said Joe, with a fixed look at me, like an effort of remembrance, “made it wery partick’ler that we should give her—were it compliments or respects, Pip?”"
"“问好。”我说道。","“Compliments,” I said."
"“我自己也是这么认为的。”乔回答说，“代她向J. 格雷戈里太太问好——”","“Which that were my own belief,” answered Joe—“her compliments to Mrs. J. Gargery—”"
"“就像问好能给我带来多大的好处一样！”我姐姐虽然这么说，却也是非常高兴。","“Much good they’ll do me!” observed my sister; but rather gratified too."
"“而且郝维仙小姐希望，”乔继续说道，同时又盯着我，仿佛又想努力记起什么，“如果她的身体状况允许的话，是不是，皮普？”","“And wishing,” pursued Joe, with another fixed look at me, like another effort of remembrance, “that the state of Miss Havisham’s elth were sitch as would have—allowed, were it, Pip?”"
"“她会很荣幸。”我补充道。","“Of her having the pleasure,” I added."
"“她会很荣幸能请你过去。”乔说道。然后他长长地喘了一口气。","“Of ladies’ company,” said Joe.And drew a long breath."
"“噢！”我姐姐喊道，同时用得到了柔和的眼神瞥了彭波契克先生一眼，“她本应该懂礼数，一开始就捎来这个口信的。不过晚到总比没有好。她给了这个野孩子什么？”","“Well!” cried my sister, with a mollified glance at Mr. Pumblechook.“She might have had the politeness to send that message at first, but it’s better late than never.And what did she give young Rantipole here?”"
"乔说：“她什么也没有给他。”","“She giv’ him,” said Joe, “nothing.”"
"乔太太正要发脾气，乔却继续往下说。","Mrs. Joe was going to break out, but Joe went on."
"“她给的东西，”乔说道，“是送给他的朋友的。根据她的解释，‘送给他的朋友’就是‘交到他的姐姐J. 格雷戈里太太手中’。这是她的原话，‘J. 格雷戈里太太’。她可能不知道，”乔带着一副沉思的表情补充道，“到底是乔还是乔治。”","“What she giv’,” said Joe, “she giv’ to his friends.‘And by his friends,’ were her explanation, ‘I mean into the hands of his sister Mrs. J. Gargery.’Them were her words; ‘Mrs. J. Gargery.’She mayn’t have know’d,” added Joe, with an appearance of reflection, “whether it were Joe, or Jorge.”"
"我姐姐看着彭波契克，他正一面抚摸着他那木制躺椅的扶手，一面对她点点头，又对着炉火点点头，仿佛他已经提前知道了这一切。","My sister looked at Pumblechook: who smoothed the elbows of his wooden armchair, and nodded at her and at the fire, as if he had known all about it beforehand."
"“你们拿到了多少钱？”我姐姐笑着问道。千真万确，她在笑！","“And how much have you got?” asked my sister, laughing.Positively, laughing!"
"“在座的各位觉得十镑怎么样？”乔问道。","“What would present company say to ten pound?” demanded Joe."
"“我们觉得，”我姐姐简短地回道，“很不错。不是很多，但很不错了。”","“They’d say,” returned my sister, curtly, “pretty well.Not too much, but pretty well.”"
"“那么，不止十镑。”乔说。","“It’s more than that, then,” said Joe."
"彭波契克那个可恶的骗子马上点了点头，一边抚摸着椅子的扶手，一边说道：“不止十镑，夫人。”","That fearful Impostor, Pumblechook, immediately nodded, and said, as he rubbed the arms of his chair: “It’s more than that, Mum.”"
"“那么，你的意思是说——”我姐姐开口说道。","“Why, you don’t mean to say—” began my sister."
"“是的，夫人，”彭波契克说，“稍安勿躁。继续说，约瑟夫（注：“乔”是“约瑟夫”的昵称）。说得好！继续！”","“Yes I do, Mum,” said Pumblechook; “but wait a bit.Go on, Joseph.Good in you!Go on!”"
"“在座的各位觉得，”乔继续说道，“二十镑怎么样？”","“What would present company say,” proceeded Joe, “to twenty pound?”"
"“可以说数目可观。”我姐姐回答说。","“Handsome would be the word,” returned my sister."
"“哦，那么，”乔说，“不止二十镑。”","“Well, then,” said Joe, “It’s more than twenty pound.”"
"彭波契克那个可鄙的伪君子，又点了点头，带着施恩于人的笑容说道：“不止那些，夫人。说得同样很好！告诉她吧，约瑟夫！”","That abject hypocrite, Pumblechook, nodded again, and said, with a patronizing laugh, “It’s more than that, Mum.Good again!Follow her up, Joseph!”"
"“那么，最后就告诉你吧，”乔高兴地把袋子递给我姐姐，说道，“一共二十五镑。”","“Then to make an end of it,” said Joe, delightedly handing the bag to my sister; “it’s five-and-twenty pound.”"
"“一共是二十五镑，夫人，”彭波契克那个卑鄙的大骗子一面重复，一面起身跟她握手，“这是以您的功劳所应得的（正如过去别人问及我的意见时，我所说的那样），我希望您好好享受这笔钱！”","“It’s five-and-twenty pound, Mum,” echoed that basest of swindlers, Pumblechook, rising to shake hands with her; “and it’s no more than your merits (as I said when my opinion was asked), and I wish you joy of the money!”"
"如果这个恶棍到此为止的话，他的罪恶就已经够大的了。可是他却继续增加自己的罪行，以一副恩人的姿态抓着我不放，这远远地超过了他之前的罪行。","If the villain had stopped here, his case would have been sufficiently awful, but he blackened his guilt by proceeding to take me into custody, with a right of patronage that left all his former criminality far behind."
"“现在，事情是这样的，约瑟夫，约瑟夫太太，”彭波契克说着抓起我的上臂，“我是那种一旦开始做某件事情就会坚持到底的人。这个孩子必须正式成为学徒。这就是我的方式。必须正式成为学徒。”","“Now you see, Joseph and wife,” said Pumblechook, as he took me by the arm above the elbow, “I am one of them that always go right through with what they’ve begun.This boy must be bound, out of hand.That’s my way.Bound out of hand.”"
"“上帝知道，彭波契克舅舅，”我姐姐紧紧地抓着袋子说道，“我们真是太感谢你了。”","“Goodness knows, Uncle Pumblechook,” said my sister (grasping the money), “we’re deeply beholden to you.”"
"“别谢我了，夫人，”那个罪大恶极的粮商回答道，“普天之下，助人为乐。但是这个孩子，你知道，我们必须让他正式成为学徒。我说过我会负责这件事情的——这是实话。”","“Never mind me, Mum, returned that diabolical corn-chandler.“A pleasure’s a pleasure, all the world over.But this boy, you know; we must have him bound.I said I’d see to it—to tell you the truth.”"
"法院坐落在附近的镇政厅里。我们立刻赶过去，要在地方法官面前让我正式成为乔的学徒。虽然我说的是“我们赶过去”，但实际上我是被彭波契克推着过去的，就像当时他正好抓到我在偷钱包或放火烧草堆一样。事实上，法院的人们都普遍认为，我是做坏事被当场抓住的，因为当彭波契克挤过人群，把我推到地方法官面前时，我听到有人说道：“他犯了什么罪？”还有人说道：“他也是年纪轻轻的，不过看起来挺坏的，不是吗？”一个面相温和、慈善的人甚至给了我一本小册子，封面上装饰着一幅木刻画，画上那个邪恶的年轻人身上捆绑的镣铐就像香肠店里的香肠一样多，小册子的题目是《牢中训诫》。","The Justices were sitting in the Town Hall near at hand, and we at once went over to have me bound apprentice to Joe in the Magisterial presence.I say, we went over, but I was pushed over by Pumblechook, exactly as if I had that moment picked a pocket or fired a rick; indeed, it was the general impression in Court that I had been taken red-handed, for, as Pumblechook shoved me before him through the crowd, I heard some people say, “What’s he done?” and others, “He’s a young ’un, too, but looks bad, don’t he?”One person of mild and benevolent aspect even gave me a tract ornamented with a woodcut of a malevolent young man fitted up with a perfect sausage-shop of fetters, and entitled, TO BE READ IN MY CELL."
"我觉得，镇政厅是一个奇怪的地方，里面的靠背长凳比教堂里的要高——人们就像挂在上面一样四处观望——几个大法官（其中一个头上抹了粉）向后靠在椅子上，有的双臂交叉，有的嗅着鼻烟，有的昏昏欲睡，有的奋笔疾书，还有的在看报纸——墙上有几幅黑亮的肖像画，在没有艺术修养的我看来，那就像是杏仁糖和橡皮膏的拼盘。就在这里的一个角落里，我的师徒契约正式签订了，并得到了公证，于是我正式成为了学徒。自始至终，彭波契克先生都抓着我，仿佛我们最终是要走向断头台的，而现在只是来这里办一些小的准备手续似的。","The Hall was a queer place, I thought, with higher pews in it than a church—and with people hanging over the pews looking on—and with mighty Justices (one with a powdered head) leaning back in chairs, with folded arms, or taking snuff, or going to sleep, or writing, or reading the newspapers—and with some shining black portraits on the walls, which my unartistic eye regarded as a composition of hardbake and sticking-plaister.Here, in a corner, my indentures were duly signed and attested, and I was “bound;” Mr. Pumblechook holding me all the while as if we had looked in on our way to the scaffold, to have those little preliminaries disposed of."
"之后我们又走出了镇政厅，摆脱了那些因为看着我被公开折磨而极其兴奋的小男孩，当他们发现我的朋友们只是围在我周围而已，便大失所望。然后我们回到了彭波契克家里。我姐姐因为这二十五个几尼而异常兴奋。她执意要用这笔横财中的一部分来请我们去“蓝野猪”饭店吃饭，要求彭波契克驾着他的轻便马车过去，还要带上哈布尔夫妇和沃甫赛先生。","When we had come out again, and had got rid of the boys who had been put into great spirits by the expectation of seeing me publicly tortured, and who were much disappointed to find that my friends were merely rallying round me, we went back to Pumblechook’s.And there my sister became so excited by the twenty-five guineas, that nothing would serve her but we must have a dinner out of that windfall, at the Blue Boar, and that Pumblechook must go over in his chaise-cart, and bring the Hubbles and Mr. Wopsle."
"这件事得到了大家的赞同，而这一天成为我度过的最痛苦的一天。因为，莫名其妙的是，似乎所有人都理所应当地认为，在这整个欢快场合当中，我就是一个多余的人。而且更糟糕的是，他们所有人都时不时地——简言之，每当在他们没有别的事可做的时候——就问我，我为什么不开心一点。当时我确实不开心，可除了说“我很开心”之外，我还能做什么的呢？　","It was agreed to be done; and a most melancholy day I passed.For, it inscrutably appeared to stand to reason, in the minds of the whole company, that I was an excrescence on the entertainment.And to make it worse, they all asked me from time to time—in short, whenever they had nothing else to do—why I didn’t enjoy myself.And what could I possibly do then, but say I was enjoying myself—when I wasn’t?"
"可是他们都是成年人了，有权利决定自己的所作所为了，而且他们充分利用了这种权利。彭波契克那个骗子，自认为自己善意地促成了这整件事情，所以洋洋自得。事实上，他占据了桌子的首席上座。他向大家讲述了我成为学徒的事情，而且恶魔般地祝贺他们说，如果我打牌、喝烈酒、夜里晚归、交上坏朋友或者沉迷于其他违背师徒契约规定的恶习的话，我就会被抓进监狱。他一边说，一边让我站在他身旁的椅子上，来演出他说的内容。","However, they were grown up and had their own way, and they made the most of it.That swindling Pumblechook, exalted into the beneficent contriver of the whole occasion, actually took the top of the table; and, when he addressed them on the subject of my being bound, and had fiendishly congratulated them on my being liable to imprisonment if I played at cards, drank strong liquors, kept late hours or bad company, or indulged in other vagaries which the form of my indentures appeared to contemplate as next to inevitable, he placed me standing on a chair beside him, to illustrate his remarks."
"我对这次盛大活动仅存的其他记忆是，他们不准我睡觉。每当他们看见我在打瞌睡时，他们就叫醒我，告诉我玩得开心点。那天晚上很晚的时候，沃甫赛先生给我们唱柯林斯的颂歌。他将血染的宝剑猛地劈下来，发出雷鸣般的响声，生动逼真，结果引来一个侍者。这个侍者说：“楼下的客人向你们问好，但说这里不是摔跤的地方。”在回家的路上，他们都兴致高昂，唱起了《哦，丽人儿！》沃甫赛先生唱男低音。为了回应那些好打听的、讨厌的人们——这些人用非常无礼的方式唱这首歌，想要知道所有人的私人事务——他用强硬的声音声明，他已是白发飘飘的人了，他是所有朝圣者队伍中最弱的一个。","My only other remembrances of the great festival are, That they wouldn’t let me go to sleep, but whenever they saw me dropping off, woke me up and told me to enjoy myself.That, rather late in the evening Mr. Wopsle gave us Collins’ ode, and threw his bloodstain’d sword in thunder down, with such effect, that a waiter came in and said, “The Commercials underneath sent up their compliments, and it wasn’t the Tumblers’ Arms.”That, they were all in excellent spirits on the road home, and sang O Lady Fair!Mr. Wopsle taking the bass, and asserting with a tremendously strong voice (in reply to the inquisitive bore who leads that piece of music in a most impertinent manner, by wanting to know all about everybody’s private affairs) that he was the man with his white locks flowing, and that he was upon the whole the weakest pilgrim going."
"最后，我记得当我回到我的小卧室时，我真的非常不愉快，而且我心中坚信，我永远都不会喜欢乔的这个行当。我曾经喜欢过这个行当，但现在已经不是那个时候了。","Finally, I remember that when I got into my little bedroom I was truly wretched, and had a strong conviction on me that I should never like Joe’s trade.I had liked it once, but once was not now."
"第十四章","Chapter 14"
"对自己的家感到羞愧是一件极为痛苦的事。这件事情本身可能是忘恩负义的表现，对此的惩罚也许是罪有应得、理所应当的，但是，那是一件痛苦的事，对此我可以作证。","It is a most miserable thing to feel ashamed of home.There may be black ingratitude in the thing, and the punishment may be retributive and well deserved; but, that it is a miserable thing, I can testify."
"由于我姐姐脾气暴躁，家对我来说从来都不是一个非常令人愉快的地方。但是，乔使这个家神圣起来，我也曾经对它深信不疑。我曾坚信那间最好的客厅是一个非常雅致的起坐间；我曾坚信前门是一扇通往国庙的神秘大门，大门庄严打开的时候要奉上烤禽作为祭品；我曾坚信厨房是一个虽不华丽却很朴实的地方；我曾坚信铁匠铺是通往成熟与独立的光明之路。在仅仅一年的时间当中，所有的这些都变了。如今，一切都粗糙而平庸，无论如何，我都不会让郝维仙小姐和埃斯特拉看到它。","Home had never been a very pleasant place to me, because of my sister’s temper.But, Joe had sanctified it, and I had believed in it.I had believed in the best parlour as a most elegant saloon; I had believed in the front door, as a mysterious portal of the Temple of State whose solemn opening was attended with a sacrifice of roast fowls; I had believed in the kitchen as a chaste though not magnificent apartment; I had believed in the forge as the glowing road to manhood and independence.Within a single year, all this was changed.Now, it was all coarse and common, and I would not have had Miss Havisham and Estella see it on any account."
"我这种不合人意的心态有多大一部分是由我自己的过错造成的，有多大一部分是由郝维仙小姐造成的，又有多大一部分是由我姐姐造成的，如今这些对我或对其他任何人来说都已经无关紧要了。我已经变了，事已至此，无法挽回了。无论是好是坏，可饶恕还是不可饶恕，总之，事已至此，无法挽回了。","How much of my ungracious condition of mind may have been my own fault, how much Miss Havisham’s, how much my sister’s, is now of no moment to me or to any one.The change was made in me; the thing was done.Well or ill done, excusably or inexcusably, it was done."
"曾经在我看来，当我最终能够卷起衣袖，作为乔的学徒走进铁匠铺的时候，我会多么神气、多么幸福。如今，我的愿望变成了现实，而我唯一的感受就是自己满身覆盖着煤屑的尘土，每天回忆起往事，心头就沉重不已，相比之下，铁砧都轻如羽毛。在我之后的生活当中，有时候（我想大部分人都是如此）我会觉得仿佛有一层厚厚的幕布落下来，把我与所有的生活乐趣以及浪漫永远地隔开，只留下沉闷和忍耐。但是当我刚刚成为乔的学徒，我的生活道路在我面前铺开的时候，落下的那块幕布显得最为沉重和空白。","Once, it had seemed to me that when I should at last roll up my shirt-sleeves and go into the forge, Joe’s prentice, I should be distinguished and happy.Now the reality was in my hold, I only felt that I was dusty with the dust of small coal, and that I had a weight upon my daily remembrance to which the anvil was a feather.There have been occasions in my later life (I suppose as in most lives) when I have felt for a time as if a thick curtain had fallen on all its interest and romance, to shut me out from anything save dull endurance any more.Never has that curtain dropped so heavy and blank, as when my way in life lay stretched out straight before me through the newly-entered road of apprenticeship to Joe."
"记得在属于我自己自由支配的最后那段日子里，我时常在星期日晚上夜幕降临的时候，站在教堂墓地附近，把我自己的前途和风中的沼泽地的景象做比较，找出两者的相似之处。我觉得两者都如此平庸、如此卑微，两个都前路未卜、迷雾重重，最终通向一片汪洋。在我成为学徒之后的第一个工作日里，我就像最后那段日子里一样沮丧。但是我很高兴的是，在我的师徒契约规定的那段时间里，我从来没有对乔抱怨过。这是整个学徒期间我唯一对自己感到高兴的事情。","I remember that at a later period of my “time,” I used to stand about the churchyard on Sunday evenings when night was falling, comparing my own perspective with the windy marsh view, and making out some likeness between them by thinking how flat and low both were, and how on both there came an unknown way and a dark mist and then the sea.I was quite as dejected on the first working-day of my apprenticeship as in that after-time; but I am glad to know that I never breathed a murmur to Joe while my indentures lasted.It is about the only thing I am glad to know of myself in that connection."
"因为，尽管学徒期间我还学到了一些手艺，但我学到这些手艺的功劳都是乔的。不是因为我忠诚，而是因为乔忠诚，所以我从来没有逃跑去当兵或者做一名水手。不是因为我有一种强烈的以勤劳为美德的观念，而是因为乔有一种强烈的以勤劳为美德的观念，所以我勉强提起了工作的热情，没有任性。我们不可能知道任何一位和善、诚实、有责任心的人对这个世界有多大的影响，但我们能够了解，与这样的人相处时自己所受到的感染。我很清楚地知道，在我学徒期间所发生的任何一件值得称道的事，都应该归功于朴实、知足的乔，而不是不安分、不知满足、野心勃勃的我。","For, though it includes what I proceed to add, all the merit of what I proceed to add was Joe’s.It was not because I was faithful, but because Joe was faithful, that I never ran away and went for a soldier or a sailor.It was not because I had a strong sense of the virtue of industry, but because Joe had a strong sense of the virtue of industry, that I worked with tolerable zeal against the grain.It is not possible to know how far the influence of any amiable honest-hearted duty-doing man flies out into the world; but it is very possible to know how it has touched one’s self in going by, and I know right well, that any good that intermixed itself with my apprenticeship came of plain contented Joe, and not of restlessly aspiring discontented me."
"我想要什么，谁能说出来？连我自己从来都不知道，我又能怎么说？我害怕的是在某个不幸的时刻，也就是我最肮脏、最平庸的时刻，我抬起眼，发现埃斯特拉正透过铁匠铺的一扇木窗向里张望。我一直害怕她早晚会发现我，看到我灰头土脸、两手污黑地干着最粗糙的活，她一定会幸灾乐祸地鄙视我。通常天黑之后，当我给乔拉着风箱，我们唱起《老克莱门之歌》时，我就会想起在郝维仙小姐家唱这首歌的情景。这时埃斯特拉的脸就会浮现在炉火之中，她漂亮的头发在风中舞动，两眼轻蔑地看着我——通常在这个时候，我会望着墙上木窗里呈现出来的夜幕，幻想我看到她刚刚把头转过去了，并且相信她最终还是会出现。","What I wanted, who can say?How can I say, when I never knew?What I dreaded was, that in some unlucky hour I, being at my grimiest and commonest, should lift up my eyes and see Estella looking in at one of the wooden windows of the forge.I was haunted by the fear that she would, sooner or later, find me out, with a black face and hands, doing the coarsest part of my work, and would exult over me and despise me.Often after dark, when I was pulling the bellows for Joe, and we were singing Old Clem, and when the thought how we used to sing it at Miss Havisham’s would seem to show me Estella’s face in the fire, with her pretty hair fluttering in the wind and her eyes scorning me,—often at such a time I would look towards those panels of black night in the wall which the wooden windows then were, and would fancy that I saw her just drawing her face away, and would believe that she had come at last."
"在那之后，我们就进屋吃晚饭。这时整个屋子以及饭菜看起来都前所未有地庸俗，而在我郁闷的心里，我对这个家也感到前所未有的羞愧。","After that, when we went in to supper, the place and the meal would have a more homely look than ever, and I would feel more ashamed of home than ever, in my own ungracious breast."
"第十五章","Chapter 15"
"随着年龄的增长，我不能再去沃甫赛先生的姑婆开办的学校里读书了，于是我在那个荒唐的老妇人手下的学习生涯结束了。然而，我的学业要等比迪把她所知道的一切都教给我才算真正结束。这一切包括从她那本小账单到她之前花半个便士买来的一首滑稽歌曲的所有内容。不过，这首滑稽歌曲当中唯一通顺的部分就只有开头的几句。","As I was getting too big for Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt’s room, my education under that preposterous female terminated.Not, however, until Biddy had imparted to me everything she knew, from the little catalogue of prices, to a comic song she had once bought for a halfpenny.Although the only coherent part of the latter piece of literature were the opening lines."
"我去伦敦的时候，嘟—噜—嘟—噜—嘟—噜—嘟—噜，难道我不是被人狠狠地骗了吗？嘟—噜—嘟—噜—嘟—噜—嘟—噜——不过，为了变得更有学问，我怀着极大的诚意把这首歌记了下来。我记得我没有怀疑过它的价值，仅有一点是，我觉得（现在仍然这么觉得）“嘟噜”的数量有点超出诗歌需要的数量。怀着对知识的渴求，我请求沃甫赛先生赐予我一些精神食粮，他很乐意地答应了。然而结果是，他只想把我当做舞台上的木制人体模型，当成他打骂、拥抱、哭诉、欺负、拧掐、捅戳以及以各种方式随意击打的对象。不久，我就拒绝了这种教导方式，尽管这时沃甫赛先生诗兴大发时的暴怒已经让我遍体鳞伤了。","When I went to Lunnon town sirs, Too rul loo rul Too rul loo rul Wasn’t I done very brown sirs? Too rul loo rul Too rul loo rul—still, in my desire to be wiser, I got this composition by heart with the utmost gravity; nor do I recollect that I questioned its merit, except that I thought (as I still do) the amount of Too rul somewhat in excess of the poetry.In my hunger for information, I made proposals to Mr. Wopsle to bestow some intellectual crumbs upon me; with which he kindly complied.As it turned out, however, that he only wanted me for a dramatic lay-figure, to be contradicted and embraced and wept over and bullied and clutched and stabbed and knocked about in a variety of ways, I soon declined that course of instruction; though not until Mr. Wopsle in his poetic fury had severely mauled me."
"不管我学到了什么，我都尽力教给乔。这句话听起来很无私，但凭良心说，我不能不解释一下这句话。我想让乔变得不那么无知、庸俗，那样的话，他就可能更配得上我的社交圈子，也能少受埃斯特拉的羞辱。","Whatever I acquired, I tried to impart to Joe.This statement sounds so well, that I cannot in my conscience let it pass unexplained.I wanted to make Joe less ignorant and common, that he might be worthier of my society and less open to Estella’s reproach."
"沼泽地里的那座古炮台就是我们学习的地方，一块破石板和一支半截的石笔就是我们的教学工具。此外乔还总是拿着一管烟袋。我从不记得乔对任何事情的记忆力会超过一个星期，也不记得在我的教导之下，他学会了任何东西。但是，他在炮台上抽烟时看起来比他在其他任何地方都更加睿智聪明——甚至是一副博学多识的样子——好像他觉得自己正在飞速进步。亲爱的朋友，我也希望他真的如此啊。","The old Battery out on the marshes was our place of study, and a broken slate and a short piece of slate pencil were our educational implements: to which Joe always added a pipe of tobacco.I never knew Joe to remember anything from one Sunday to another, or to acquire, under my tuition, any piece of information whatever.Yet he would smoke his pipe at the Battery with a far more sagacious air than anywhere else—even with a learned air—as if he considered himself to be advancing immensely.Dear fellow, I hope he did."
"周围的环境宜人而又静谧。不远处船在河上扬帆驶过，风帆高过土垒。有时，正值落潮时分，那些风帆宛如挂在仍在水底航行的乘船之上。每当我看到扬起白帆的船只驶向大海时，我就会想起郝维仙小姐和埃斯特拉；每当远处夕阳西斜，映照在云朵、船帆、青山或者船只的吃水线上时，我同样会想起她们——郝维仙小姐，埃斯特拉，那奇怪的房子和奇怪的生活似乎和一切如画的风景都有关联。","It was pleasant and quiet, out there with the sails on the river passing beyond the earthwork, and sometimes, when the tide was low, looking as if they belonged to sunken ships that were still sailing on at the bottom of the water.Whenever I watched the vessels standing out to sea with their white sails spread, I somehow thought of Miss Havisham and Estella; and whenever the light struck aslant, afar off, upon a cloud or sail or green hill-side or water-line, it was just the same.—Miss Havisham and Estella and the strange house and the strange life appeared to have something to do with everything that was picturesque."
"有一个星期天，乔一边尽情地享受着他的烟袋，一边因为自己“愚笨至极”而大肆夸耀。这样我只能让他停学一天。我用手托着下巴在土垒上躺了一会儿，眼前所有的景色都让我看出郝维仙小姐和埃斯特拉的身影，不论是天空中还是河面上。最后我决心说出那个一直藏在我脑海里有关她们的念头。","One Sunday when Joe, greatly enjoying his pipe, had so plumed himself on being “most awful dull,” that I had given him up for the day, I lay on the earthwork for some time with my chin on my hand, descrying traces of Miss Havisham and Estella all over the prospect, in the sky and in the water, until at last I resolved to mention a thought concerning them that had been much in my head."
"“乔，”我说，“你不觉得我应该去拜访一下郝维仙小姐吗？”","“Joe,” said I; “don’t you think I ought to make Miss Havisham a visit?”"
"“嗯，皮普，”乔慢慢地思忖着回答，“目的是什么呢？”","“Well, Pip,” returned Joe, slowly considering. “What for?”"
"“目的，乔？拜访怎么会有什么目的呢？”","“What for, Joe?What is any visit made for?”"
"“也许，有些拜访，”乔说道，“是不用考虑目的，皮普。但是至于拜访郝维仙小姐，她可能会认为你想要什么东西——想从她那里得到什么东西。”","“There is some wisits, p’r’aps,” said Joe, “as for ever remains open to the question, Pip.But in regard to wisiting Miss Havisham.She might think you wanted something—expected something of her.”"
"“难道你不知道，我会说我并不想要任何东西吗，乔？”","“Don’t you think I might say that I did not, Joe?”"
"“你会这样说的，老弟。”乔说道，“她可能会相信你，同样的，她也可能不信你。”“她可能会相信你。同样的，她也可能不信你。”","“You might, old chap,” said Joe,“And she might credit it.Similarly she mightn’t.”"
"乔觉得自己说得有道理，我也这么觉得。他用力地抽着烟袋，以免不断重复会使自己话语的力度有削弱的危险。","Joe felt, as I did, that he had made a point there, and he pulled hard at his pipe to keep himself from weakening it by repetition."
"“你知道，皮普，”乔一过了那个使自己话语的力度被削弱的危险期就马上接着说道，“郝维仙小姐已经给了你一大笔钱了。郝维仙小姐给了你一大笔钱之后，她把我叫回去，对我说，就这么多了。”","“You see, Pip,” Joe pursued, as soon as he was past that danger, “Miss Havisham done the handsome thing by you.When Miss Havisham done the handsome thing by you, she called me back to say to me as that were all.”"
"“我知道，乔。我听见她说了。”","“Yes, Joe.I heard her.”"
"“就这么多了。”乔非常着重地重复道。","“ALL,” Joe repeated, very emphatically."
"“知道了，乔。我告诉过你，我听到她的话了。”","“Yes, Joe.I tell you, I heard her.”"
"“我是想说，皮普，她的意思可能是——做个了结吧！——就像之前那样！——你走你的阳关道，我过我的独木桥！——两不相干！”","“Which I meantersay, Pip, it might be that her meaning were—Make a end on it!—As you was!—Me to the North, and you to the South!—Keep in sunders!”"
"我之前也想到了这一点，而发现他也是这么想的让我更不安了，因为这让事情看起来很可能是这样的。","I had thought of that too, and it was very far from comforting to me to find that he had thought of it; for it seemed to render it more probable."
"“但是，乔。”","“But, Joe.”"
"“怎么了，老弟？”","“Yes, old chap.”"
"“现在是我自成为学徒那天之后的第一年，我从来没有对郝维仙小姐表示过感谢、问候，或是表示我对她的怀念。”","“Here am I, getting on in the first year of my time, and, since the day of my being bound, I have never thanked Miss Havisham, or asked after her, or shown that I remember her.”"
"“的确是，皮普。除非你想为她打一副马蹄铁——这只是我的意思，因为即使是一副马蹄铁也不能算得上是礼物，毕竟，她根本没有马——”","“That’s true, Pip; and unless you was to turn her out a set of shoes all four round—and which I meantersay as even a set of shoes all four round might not be acceptable as a present, in a total wacancy of hoofs—”"
"“我并不是说那种纪念，乔，我不是想送一个礼物。”","“I don’t mean that sort of remembrance, Joe; I don’t mean a present.”"
"但是乔脑子里已经有了送礼物的主意，他就一定要唠叨个不停。“或者，”他说道，“我可以帮你为她打一条新铁链用来锁大门——或者一两罗鲨鱼头的螺钉，她平时可以用——或者一些小巧好玩的玩意，比如她做松饼时可以用的烤叉——或者她烤鲱鱼或其他鱼时可以用的烤架——”","But Joe had got the idea of a present in his head and must harp upon it.“Or even,” said he, “if you was helped to knocking her up a new chain for the front door—or say a gross or two of shark-headed screws for general use—or some light fancy article, such as a toasting-fork when she took her muffins—or a gridiron when she took a sprat or such like—”"
"“我什么礼物都不想送，乔。”我打断他。","“I don’t mean any present at all, Joe,” I interposed."
"“哦，”乔仍然唠叨个没完，就像我特意逼他讲一样，“如果我是你的话，皮普，我不会送礼的。不，我肯定不会送礼的。因为她已经有一条总是挂在门上的铁链了，何必再给她打一条呢？　而鲨鱼头形状的螺钉可能会造成误解。如果要打一个烤叉，你就得用黄铜锻造，这个活你干不好。而且最好的铁匠也无法通过打个烤架来展示自己的好手艺——因为烤架就只是个烤架而已。”乔说道，他决心要让我意识到其中的重要性，仿佛努力把我从一个固执的谬误中唤醒，“你可以随心所欲地打，但打出来的就是一个烤架，不管你愿意还是不愿意，你都做不了主——”","“Well,” said Joe, still harping on it as though I had particularly pressed it, “if I was yourself, Pip, I wouldn’t.No, I would not.For what’s a door-chain when she’s got one always up?And shark-headers is open to misrepresentations.And if it was a toasting-fork, you’d go into brass and do yourself no credit.And the oncommonest workman can’t show himself oncommon in a gridiron—for a gridiron IS a gridiron,” said Joe, steadfastly impressing it upon me, as if he were endeavouring to rouse me from a fixed delusion, “and you may haim at what you like, but a gridiron it will come out, either by your leave or again your leave, and you can’t help yourself—”"
"“我亲爱的乔，”我抓住他的大衣，绝望地喊道，“别再说下去了。我从来都没有想过给郝维仙小姐做任何礼物。”","“My dear Joe,” I cried, in desperation, taking hold of his coat, “don’t go on in that way.I never thought of making Miss Havisham any present.”"
"“不送礼物，皮普，”乔赞成地说道，仿佛他一直都在坚持这一点，“我想告诉你的是，你这么做是对的，皮普。”","“No, Pip,” Joe assented, as if he had been contending for that, all along; “and what I say to you is, you are right, Pip.”"
"“是啊，乔。但我的意思是，既然现在铁匠铺里的生意很冷清，你能不能明天给我半天假，我想去镇上拜访一下埃斯——郝维仙小姐。”","“Yes, Joe; but what I wanted to say, was, that as we are rather slack just now, if you would give me a half-holiday to-morrow, I think I would go up-town and make a call on Miss Est—Havisham.”"
"“她的名字，”乔郑重地说道，“可不是埃斯特维仙，皮普，除非她改了名字。”","“Which her name,” said Joe, gravely, “ain’t Estavisham, Pip, unless she have been rechris’ened.”"
"“我知道，乔，我知道。刚刚是我的口误。你觉得我的想法怎么样，乔？”","“I know, Joe, I know.It was a slip of mine.What do you think of it, Joe?”"
"简单地说，乔觉得如果我认为这想法不错的话，他也认为这想法不错。但是，他特别要求，尽管我的拜访没有其他的目的，只是对我收到的恩惠表示感激而已，如果她们没有热情地招待我，或者她们不希望我再去拜访，那这种实验性的拜访就不能有第二次。我保证答应这些条件。","In brief, Joe thought that if I thought well of it, he thought well of it.But, he was particular in stipulating that if I were not received with cordiality, or if I were not encouraged to repeat my visit as a visit which had no ulterior object but was simply one of gratitude for a favor received, then this experimental trip should have no successor.By these conditions I promised to abide."
"那时，乔雇了一名已经出徒的工匠，名字叫奥立克，每周给他结一次工资。他佯称自己的教名是陶尔基——这显然是不可能的——但是他生性执拗，我相信他在名字这方面绝不是妄想，而是故意把这个名字强加给村民，利用其含义作为对他们的侮辱。他是个肩膀宽大、四肢懒散、皮肤黝黑、力大如牛的壮汉，从来都不着急，而且总是拖拖拉拉。他甚至从来都不像是特地来工作的，而是无精打采地走进来，仿佛只是偶然撞进来而已。不论是去“快活船员”酒馆吃饭还是晚上离开的时候，他都是慢悠悠地走出去，就像该隐或流浪的犹太人一样，仿佛他根本不知道自己要去哪里，也不打算再回来。他租住在沼泽地那边的一个水闸管理工家里。上工日就从他的隐居所里慢悠悠地走出来，手插在口袋里，干粮松松垮垮地包好套在脖子上，晃晃悠悠地挂在后背上。每到星期天，他大部分时间都躺在水闸堤上，或者倚靠着草堆或堆草房站在那里。他走路的时候总是无精打采，两眼盯着地面。当有人跟他搭讪或者必须要抬起眼的时候，他就会一半愤恨一半迷茫地抬起头，仿佛他仅有的一个想法就是自己从来都不能好好思考，这真是件古怪又委屈的事情。","Now, Joe kept a journeyman at weekly wages whose name was Orlick.He pretended that his Christian name was Dolge—a clear impossibility—but he was a fellow of that obstinate disposition that I believe him to have been the prey of no delusion in this particular, but wilfully to have imposed that name upon the village as an affront to its understanding.He was a broad-shouldered loose-limbed swarthy fellow of great strength, never in a hurry, and always slouching.He never even seemed to come to his work on purpose, but would slouch in as if by mere accident; and when he went to the Jolly Bargemen to eat his dinner, or went away at night, he would slouch out, like Cain or the Wandering Jew, as if he had no idea where he was going and no intention of ever coming back.He lodged at a sluice-keeper’s out on the marshes, and on working days would come slouching from his hermitage, with his hands in his pockets and his dinner loosely tied in a bundle round his neck and dangling on his back.On Sundays he mostly lay all day on the sluice-gates, or stood against ricks and barns. He always slouched, locomotively, with his eyes on the ground; and, when accosted or otherwise required to raise them, he looked up in a half resentful, half puzzled way, as though the only thought he ever had, was, that it was rather an odd and injurious fact that he should never be thinking."
"这个怪脾气的工匠一点都不喜欢我。在我年幼胆小的时候，他告诉我魔鬼就住在铁匠铺的一个黑角落里，他很了解这个魔鬼。他还说必须每七年就要用一个活生生的小男孩来生火，所以我也可能被当成燃料。在我成了乔的学徒之后，奥立克也许就确认了他之前的某种怀疑，那就是我会取代他的位置，因此，他就更不喜欢我了。不过他从来没有说过什么或做过什么来公开表示对我的敌意。我只是注意到，他总是把打铁的火星溅到我的方向，而且每次我唱起《老克莱门之歌》的时候，他都插进来捣乱。","This morose journeyman had no liking for me.When I was very small and timid, he gave me to understand that the Devil lived in a black corner of the forge, and that he knew the fiend very well: also that it was necessary to make up the fire, once in seven years, with a live boy, and that I might consider myself fuel.When I became Joe’s ’prentice, Orlick was perhaps confirmed in some suspicion that I should displace him; howbeit, he liked me still less.Not that he ever said anything, or did anything, openly importing hostility; I only noticed that he always beat his sparks in my direction, and that whenever I sang Old Clem, he came in out of time."
"第二天当我提醒乔准我半天假的时候，陶尔基·奥立克也在场，他正在干活。当时他没有说什么，因为他正和乔面对面打一块热铁，我在拉风箱。但慢慢地，他倚在他的铁锤上开始说道：","Dolge Orlick was at work and present, next day, when I reminded Joe of my half-holiday.He said nothing at the moment, for he and Joe had just got a piece of hot iron between them, and I was at the bellows; but by-and-by he said, leaning on his hammer:"
"“这样啊，老板！你肯定不能只偏爱我们当中的一个人。如果小皮普有半天假的话，老奥立克也得有半天假。”我猜想他大概25岁，但他总是把自己说得像是个年纪很老的人。","“Now, master!Sure you’re not a-going to favor only one of us.If Young Pip has a half-holiday, do as much for Old Orlick.” I suppose he was about five-and-twenty, but he usually spoke of himself as an ancient person."
"“为什么，你要半天假干什么？”乔说道。","“Why, what’ll you do with a half-holiday, if you get it?” said Joe."
"“我要半天假干什么！他要半天假干什么？我就干他要干的事。”奥立克说道。","“What’ll I do with it!What’ll he do with it?I’ll do as much with it as him,” said Orlick."
"“至于皮普，他要去镇上。”乔说。","“As to Pip, he’s going up-town,” said Joe."
"“那好，老奥立克也一样，他也去镇上。”这个大人物反驳道，“两个人也能去镇上。不能只有一个人能去镇上。”","“Well then, as to Old Orlick, he’s a-going up-town,” retorted that worthy.“Two can go up-town.Tan’t only one wot can go up-town."
"“别发火。”乔说道。","“Don’t lose your temper,” said Joe."
"“我想发火就发火。”奥立克吼道，“只准某些人去镇上，就像镇上是他们的！行啦，老板！行啦．这个铺子里不能搞特殊照顾。得做个光明正大的男子汉！”","“Shall if I like,” growled Orlick.“Some and their up-towning!Now, master!Come.No favoring in this shop.Be a man!”"
"在工匠的脾气好点之前，老板拒绝理会这码事。奥立克猛地冲向熔炉那边，钳出一块火红的铁条朝我这边冲过来，仿佛他要把它插进我的身体似的。他将铁条迅速绕过我的头顶，然后放在铁砧上开始捶打——我觉得仿佛那块铁条就是我，火星就是我四溅的鲜血——最后当他自己捶打得浑身发热，而铁条已经冷却的时候，他又倚着铁锤说道：","The master refusing to entertain the subject until the journeyman was in a better temper, Orlick plunged at the furnace, drew out a red-hot bar, made at me with it as if he were going to run it through my body, whisked it round my head, laid it on the anvil, hammered it out—as if it were I, I thought, and the sparks were my spirting blood—and finally said, when he had hammered himself hot and the iron cold, and he again leaned on his hammer:"
"“哎，老板！”","“Now, master!”"
"“你现在气消了？”乔问道。","“Are you all right now?” demanded Joe."
"“啊！我气消了。”老奥立克口气生硬地说道。","“Ah! I am all right,” said gruff Old Orlick."
"“那么，由于你基本上跟大多数人一样按时上工，”乔说道，“就给你们都放半天假吧。”","“Then, as in general you stick to your work as well as most men,” said Joe, “let it be a half-holiday for all.”"
"我姐姐一直都在院子里能听得见我们说话的范围内静静地站着——她是个非常没有道德的探子和偷听者——她随即透过一扇窗户朝里张望。","My sister had been standing silent in the yard, within hearing—she was a most unscrupulous spy and listener—and she instantly looked in at one of the windows."
"“就像你这种傻瓜，”我姐姐对乔说道，“才会给那种游手好闲的大块头放假！就像你很有钱，能这样挥霍工资一样！我真希望我是他老板！”","“Like you, you fool!” said she to Joe, “giving holidays to great idle hulkers like that.You are a rich man, upon my life, to waste wages in that way.I wish I was his master!”"
"“你要是敢的话，你可以成为所有人的老板。”奥立克不怀好意地笑着反驳道。","“You’d be everybody’s master, if you durst,” retorted Orlick, with an ill-favored grin."
"（“别惹她。”乔说道。）","(“Let her alone,” said Joe.)"
"“我治得了所有的傻瓜和无赖。”我姐姐回敬道，她已经开始发怒了，“我治得了其他的傻瓜就治得了你老板，他可是傻瓜里的笨蛋之王。我治得了所有的无赖流氓就治得了你，你算是从这里到法国最难看、最坏的无赖了。哼！”","“I’d be a match for all noodles and all rogues,” returned my sister, beginning to work herself into a mighty rage.“And I couldn’t be a match for the noodles, without being a match for your master, who’s the dunder-headed king of the noodles.And I couldn’t be a match for the rogues, without being a match for you, who are the blackest-looking and the worst rogue between this and France.Now!”"
"“你这个恶毒的泼妇，格雷戈里老太婆！”工匠吼道，“要是这算是无赖的话，你可是算是个大无赖。”","“You’re a foul shrew, Mother Gargery, growled the journeyman.“If that makes a judge of rogues, you ought to be a good’un.”"
"（“别惹她，行不行？”乔说道。）","(“Let her alone, will you?” said Joe.)"
"“你刚说什么？”我姐姐喊道，她已经开始尖叫起来了，“你刚刚说什么？奥立克那家伙刚刚跟我说什么，皮普？他刚刚在我丈夫面前骂我什么来着？啊！啊！啊！”每一声感叹都是一声尖叫，我必须说的是，跟我见过的所有性情暴烈的女人一样，激愤并不能成为她的借口。因为不可否认的是，她并不是被激怒的，而是有意识地、故意地、花大力气逼着自己发怒的，按照几个固定的步骤胡乱地发一通脾气。“他刚刚在那个发誓要保护我的男人面前骂我什么来着？啊！扶着我！啊！”","“What did you say?” cried my sister, beginning to scream.“What did you say?What did that fellow Orlick say to me, Pip?What did he call me, with my husband standing by?O!O!O!”Each of these exclamations was a shriek; and I must remark of my sister, what is equally true of all the violent women I have ever seen, that passion was no excuse for her, because it is undeniable that instead of lapsing into passion, she consciously and deliberately took extraordinary pains to force herself into it, and became blindly furious by regular stages; “what was the name he gave me before the base man who swore to defend me?O!Hold me!O!”"
"“啊——！”工匠咬牙切齿地吼道，“你要是我老婆的话，我就抓住你。","“Ah-h-h!” growled the journeyman, between his teeth, “I’d hold you, if you was my wife."
"我把你抓到水泵下面，把你呛死。”","I’d hold you under the pump, and choke it out of you.”"
"（“我告诉你，别惹她。”乔说。）","(“I tell you, let her alone,” said Joe.)"
"“啊！听听他都说了些什么！”我姐姐喊道，她一边拍手一边尖叫——这是她的第二步，“听听他都怎么骂我！那奥立克！在我自己家里！骂我，骂我一个结了婚的女人！在我丈夫面前！啊！啊！”这时，在一顿拍手尖叫之后，我姐姐开始捶胸拍膝，扔掉帽子，披头散发——这是她发疯的最后一步了。此时她已经成功地变成了一个十足的疯子，猛地冲向大门，幸运的是，我已经把门给锁了。","“Oh!To hear him!” cried my sister, with a clap of her hands and a scream together—which was her next stage.“To hear the names he’s giving me!That Orlick!In my own house!Me, a married woman!With my husband standing by!O!O!”Here my sister, after a fit of clappings and screamings, beat her hands upon her bosom and upon her knees, and threw her cap off, and pulled her hair down—which were the last stages on her road to frenzy.Being by this time a perfect Fury and a complete success, she made a dash at the door, which I had fortunately locked."
"插了几句没人理会的话之后，可怜的乔又能怎么办呢？他只能勇敢地面对他的工匠，质问他为什么要插进来干涉自己与乔太太之间的事，问他够不够胆量来和他对决。老奥立克觉得眼下的局势也只能对决了，所以马上就摆出了防守的架势。于是两人连烤焦烧坏的围裙都没有脱，就像两个巨人一样厮打起来。但是，我从来没有见过附近有谁能打得过乔。奥立克似乎比那个脸色苍白的绅士强不到哪里去，很快他就被打倒在煤灰堆里了，爬也爬不起来。然后乔打开门，扶起我姐姐。她已经昏倒在窗户那边了（但我想，她是看完对决才昏倒的）。我姐姐被扶进房里躺下，在大家的劝慰之下苏醒过来，之后她就只是挣扎着用两手紧紧揪住乔的头发。接着，一片喧闹之后是一种怪异的寂静和沉默。这种沉寂总是让我产生一种模糊的感觉——那就是，这是个星期天，有人死掉了——带着这种感觉我上楼去换衣服。","What could the wretched Joe do now, after his disregarded parenthetical interruptions, but stand up to his journeyman, and ask him what he meant by interfering betwixt himself and Mrs. Joe; and further whether he was man enough to come on?Old Orlick felt that the situation admitted of nothing less than coming on, and was on his defense straightway; so, without so much as pulling off their singed and burnt aprons, they went at one another, like two giants.But, if any man in that neighborhood could stand up long against Joe, I never saw the man.Orlick, as if he had been of no more account than the pale young gentleman, was very soon among the coal-dust, and in no hurry to come out of it.Then, Joe unlocked the door and picked up my sister, who had dropped insensible at the window (but who had seen the fight first, I think), and who was carried into the house and laid down, and who was recommended to revive, and would do nothing but struggle and clench her hands in Joe’s hair.Then, came that singular calm and silence which succeed all uproars; and then, with the vague sensation which I have always connected with such a lull—namely, that it was Sunday, and somebody was dead—I went up-stairs to dress myself."
"当我再次来到楼下时，发现乔和奥立克正在打扫。刚刚的骚乱没有留下一丝痕迹，除了奥立克一只鼻孔上的一个裂口，而这个裂口既不明显，也没有装饰性。楼下有一罐从“快活船员”酒馆那里买来的啤酒，他们俩平静地分享，轮流把盏。这份沉寂对乔有镇静的作用，也让他泰然起来。他跟着我走出来，在路上跟我说了一句可能会让我受益的临别赠言：“一下暴跳如雷，皮普，一下风平浪静，皮普——这就是生活！”","When I came down again, I found Joe and Orlick sweeping up, without any other traces of discomposure than a slit in one of Orlick’s nostrils, which was neither expressive nor ornamental.A pot of beer had appeared from the Jolly Bargemen, and they were sharing it by turns in a peaceable manner.The lull had a sedative and philosophical influence on Joe, who followed me out into the road to say, as a parting observation that might do me good, “On the Rampage, Pip, and off the Rampage, Pip—such is Life!”"
"我又一次走向郝维仙小姐的家。我内心的感觉荒唐可笑（因为一个成年人认为很严肃的感觉在一个孩子看来却很滑稽），不过这些都无关紧要了。我是如何在门口徘徊多次才决心按响门铃的，这也不重要了。我是如何挣扎着是否应该不按门铃直接离开，如何说服自己说，要是能够自由支配时间的话，我一定早就回来这里了。","With what absurd emotions (for, we think the feelings that are very serious in a man quite comical in a boy) I found myself again going to Miss Havisham’s, matters little here.Nor, how I passed and repassed the gate many times before I could make up my mind to ring.Nor, how I debated whether I should go away without ringing; nor, how I should undoubtedly have gone, if my time had been my own, to come back."
"萨拉·鄱凯特小姐出来开门。不是埃斯特拉。","Miss Sarah Pocket came to the gate.No Estella."
"“怎么了？你又来了？”鄱凯特小姐说道，“你想干什么？”","“How, then? You here again?” said Miss Pocket.“What do you want?”"
"当我说我只是来看看郝维仙小姐之后，萨拉显然就思忖着她是不是应该直接把我打发走。但是，由于不想承担后果，她还是让我进门了，而且随后就带来简短的口信说，我可以“上去”了。","When I said that I only came to see how Miss Havisham was, Sarah evidently deliberated whether or no she should send me about my business.But, unwilling to hazard the responsibility, she let me in, and presently brought the sharp message that I was to “come up.”"
"一切都没有改变，郝维仙小姐还是一个人。","Everything was unchanged, and Miss Havisham was alone."
"“怎么了？”她盯着我说道，“我希望你不是来要什么东西的吧？你什么也得不到。”","“Well?” said she, fixing her eyes upon me.“I hope you want nothing?You'll get nothing.”"
"“不是，真的不是，郝维仙小姐。我只是想让您知道，我做学徒表现非常好，我一直都非常感激您。”","“No, indeed, Miss Havisham.I only wanted you to know that I am doing very well in my apprenticeship, and am always much obliged to you.”"
"“好啦，好啦！”她还是那样不耐烦地晃动着手指，“时常过来吧，你生日那天过来吧——哎！”她突然叫了一声，挪动着椅子把身体转向我这边，“你四下张望是在找埃斯特拉吧？嗯？”","“There, there!” with the old restless fingers.“Come now and then; come on your birthday.—Ay!” she cried suddenly, turning herself and her chair towards me, “You are looking round for Estella?Hey?”"
"我是在四下张望——事实上的确在找埃斯特拉——我结结巴巴地说，我希望她一切都好。","I had been looking round—in fact, for Estella—and I stammered that I hoped she was well."
"“到国外去了，”郝维仙小姐说，“去接受贵族小姐式的教育了，很远很远，她比以前更漂亮了，所有见过她的人都很仰慕她。你是不是觉得失去了她？”","“Abroad,” said Miss Havisham; “educating for a lady; far out of reach; prettier than ever; admired by all who see her.Do you feel that you have lost her?”"
"她说最后一句话的时候非常幸灾乐祸，发出令人生厌的笑声，而我却六神无主，不知道说什么。还好她打发我离开，也省得我费神考虑说什么。我出去之后，萨拉关上了大门，她脸上的表情就跟胡桃壳一样僵硬。我对我的家、我的行业以及我的一切都感到前所未有的不满意，这是我这次拜访给我留下的所有感受。","There was such a malignant enjoyment in her utterance of the last words, and she broke into such a disagreeable laugh, that I was at a loss what to say.She spared me the trouble of considering, by dismissing me.When the gate was closed upon me by Sarah of the walnut-shell countenance, I felt more than ever dissatisfied with my home and with my trade and with everything; and that was all I took by that motion."
"当我沿着大街闲逛，愁闷地看着商店的橱窗，思忖着要是我是个有钱的绅士我会买什么的时候，一个人从书店里走出来，那个人竟然是沃甫赛先生。沃甫赛先生手里握着一本书，描写乔治·巴恩韦尔那让人为之动容的悲惨历程。他花了六便士买来这本书，因为他马上要和彭波契克先生一起喝茶，到时候他要把书中的每一个字都输进彭波契克的脑子里。他一看见我就立刻觉得是上天给他派来一个学徒让他解读。他抓住我，坚持要我陪他一起到彭波契克家的客厅去。由于我知道回到家里也会很痛苦，晚上天又黑，路上又枯燥，随便有个人路上与自己作伴也比没有好，所以我没有拒绝。于是我们就来到彭波契克家，而此时街道和商店都开始上灯了。","As I was loitering along the High-street, looking in disconsolately at the shop windows, and thinking what I would buy if I were a gentleman, who should come out of the bookshop but Mr. Wopsle.Mr Wopsle had in his hand the affecting tragedy of George Barnwell, in which he had that moment invested sixpence, with the view of heaping every word of it on the head of Pumblechook, with whom he was going to drink tea.No sooner did he see me, than he appeared to consider that a special Providence had put a ’prentice in his way to be read at; and he laid hold of me, and insisted on my accompanying him to the Pumblechookian parlor.As I knew it would be miserable at home, and as the nights were dark and the way was dreary, and almost any companionship on the road was better than none, I made no great resistance; consequently, we turned into Pumblechook’s just as the street and the shops were lighting up."
"因为我之前从来没有参加过任何阅读乔治·巴恩韦尔的活动，我不知道它通常会持续多长时间。但我记得很清楚的是，那天晚上一直到九点半才结束。当沃甫赛先生讲到巴恩韦尔进入纽盖特监狱时，我觉得他永远也讲不到巴恩韦尔上断头台那里，因为对这部分他讲述得比讲述巴恩韦尔之前的、不光彩的人生旅途更慢了。我觉得有点过分的是，他竟抱怨说自己在鼎盛时期却被摧残了，仿佛他的生命一开始就马上走向枯叶的衰败，根本就没有结出果实。然而这仅仅是一个又长又无聊的问题。刺痛我的是，无辜的我被拿来与这整件事情作类比。当巴恩韦尔开始步入歧途时，我就得宣布我感到非常愧悔，因为彭波契克愤怒地注视着我，让我不得不这么做。沃甫赛先生也费尽心思把我描述得很恶劣。书中的我有一次兽性大发，情感崩溃，谋杀了我的伯父，这在任何情况下都是不可饶恕的；密尔伍德在每次争论当中都会把我驳倒；我老板的女儿对我体贴入微，简直到了偏执的程度；在那个致命的早晨，对于我气喘吁吁、迟疑不决的行为，我只能说，那都是由于我性格当中存在一种普遍的软弱性。即使我庆幸自己终于被绞死了，而沃甫赛也合上了书之后，彭波契克还是坐在那里注视着我，一面摇头一面说道：“引以为戒，小子，引以为戒！”仿佛众所周知的是，我在策划谋杀我的一个近亲，前提只是我能引诱上一个容易上当的人成为我的捐助者。","As I never assisted at any other representation of George Barnwell, I don’t know how long it may usually take; but I know very well that it took until half-past nine o’clock that night, and that when Mr. Wopsle got into Newgate, I thought he never would go to the scaffold, he became so much slower than at any former period of his disgraceful career.I thought it a little too much that he should complain of being cut short in his flower after all, as if he had not been running to seed, leaf after leaf, ever since his course began.This, however, was a mere question of length and wearisomeness.What stung me, was the identification of the whole affair with my unoffending self.When Barnwell began to go wrong, I declare that I felt positively apologetic, Pumblechook’s indignant stare so taxed me with it.Wopsle, too, took pains to present me in the worst light.At once ferocious and maudlin, I was made to murder my uncle with no extenuating circumstances whatever; Millwood put me down in argument, on every occasion; it became sheer monomania in my master’s daughter to care a button for me; and all I can say for my gasping and procrastinating conduct on the fatal morning, is, that it was worthy of the general feebleness of my character.Even after I was happily hanged and Wopsle had closed the book, Pumblechook sat staring at me, and shaking his head, and saying, “Take warning, boy, take warning!” as if it were a well-known fact that I contemplated murdering a near relation, provided I could only induce one to have the weakness to become my benefactor."
"当一切都结束了，我和沃甫赛先生踏上回家的路时，天已经非常黑了。一出镇，我们就发现浓雾弥漫，雾气又湿又厚。路灯灯光昏暗，显然远比不上平时的亮度，光束在雾中看起来成了一种固体物。我们注意到这一切，讨论着大雾是如何随着我们那边沼泽地上某一处风向的改变而弥漫开来的。这时我们遇见一个人，那人正无精打采地躲在公路收费处的背风面。","It was a very dark night when it was all over, and when I set out with Mr. Wopsle on the walk home.Beyond town, we found a heavy mist out, and it fell wet and thick.The turnpike lamp was a blur, quite out of the lamp’s usual place apparently, and its rays looked solid substance on the fog.We were noticing this, and saying how that the mist rose with a change of wind from a certain quarter of our marshes, when we came upon a man, slouching under the lee of the turnpike house."
"“嗨！”我们停下来说道，“是奥立克在那里吗？”","“Halloa!” we said, stopping.“Orlick, there?”"
"“哎！”他回答道，慢悠悠地走出来，“我刚路过，在这里站一会儿，看能不能找个同伴。”","“Ah!” he answered, slouching out.“I was standing by, a minute, on the chance of company.”"
"“你回去得太晚了。”我说道。","“You are late,” I remarked."
"奥立克很自然地回答说：“怎么了？你也晚了。”","Orlick not unnaturally answered, “Well?And you're late.”"
"“我们刚刚，”沃甫赛先生说道，他为自己今晚的表演得意洋洋，“奥立克先生，我们刚刚整晚都沉浸在学术活动当中。”","“We have been,” said Mr. Wopsle, exalted with his late performance, “we have been indulging, Mr. Orlick, in an intellectual evening.”"
"老奥立克低声嘟哝了一声，似乎对此无言以对。然后我们一起上路了。我随后问他，是不是这半天假都用在去镇上的这一来一回里了。","Old Orlick growled, as if he had nothing to say about that, and we all went on together.I asked him presently whether he had been spending his half-holiday up and down town?"
"“对啊，”他说，“都花在这上面了。我就跟在你后面。我没有看到你，但我一定是离你很近。顺便说一句，又在放炮了。”","“Yes,” said he, “all of it.I come in behind yourself.I didn’t see you, but I must have been pretty close behind you.By-the-bye, the guns is going again.”"
"“监狱船上？”我说。","“At the Hulks?” said I."
"“嗯！哪只鸟从笼子里逃出来了。天一黑，炮声就断断续续地开始响。过一会儿你就能听到一声炮响。”","“Ay!There’s some of the birds flown from the cages.The guns have been going since dark, about.You’ll hear one presently.”"
"果然，我们没走出几码远就迎面传来一声熟悉的炮声。声音被浓雾减弱，低沉地沿着河边的低地扩散开来，仿佛在追赶并威慑着那些逃犯。","In effect, we had not walked many yards further, when the well remembered boom came towards us, deadened by the mist, and heavily rolled away along the low grounds by the river, as if it were pursuing and threatening the fugitives."
"“今晚就适合把他们处置了。”奥立克说，“我们不知道今晚怎么把那只逃走的笼中之鸟给射死。”","“A good night for cutting off in,” said Orlick.“We’d be puzzled how to bring down a jail-bird on the wing, to-night.”"
"这个问题让我产生了联想，我默默地思考着。沃甫赛先生就像今晚那场悲剧里面那个得不偿失的伯父一样，陷入了他自己在坎布威尔花园中大声地冥想。奥立克两手插在口袋里，无精打采、脚步沉重地走在我旁边。周围漆黑、潮湿、泥泞，所以我们脚下水花四溅。偶尔又有信号炮声迎面而来，并再次低沉地沿河扩散开来。我就自顾自地走着，想着心事。沃甫赛先生安详地死于坎布威尔，非常奋勇地死于博斯沃思田野，极其痛苦地死于格拉斯顿伯里。奥立克有时会低声吼道：“使劲敲啊，使劲敲啊——老克莱门！臂膀结实，叮当作响——老克莱门！”我觉得他喝过酒了，但他没有喝醉。","The subject was a suggestive one to me, and I thought about it in silence.Mr. Wopsle, as the ill-requited uncle of the evening’s tragedy, fell to meditating aloud in his garden at Camberwell.Orlick, with his hands in his pockets, slouched heavily at my side.It was very dark, very wet, very muddy, and so we splashed along.Now and then, the sound of the signal cannon broke upon us again, and again rolled sulkily along the course of the river.I kept myself to myself and my thoughts.Mr. Wopsle died amiably at Camberwell, and exceedingly game on Bosworth Field, and in the greatest agonies at Glastonbury.Orlick sometimes growled, “Beat it out, beat it out—Old Clem!With a clink for the stout—Old Clem!”I thought he had been drinking, but he was not drunk."
"就这样，我们回到了村里。回村的路上我们经过“三个快活船员”酒馆。我们惊奇地发现，虽然已经是十一点钟了，酒馆却是一片骚乱，大门敞开，有些奇怪的蜡烛之前被匆忙地拿起又放下，现在散落在四处。沃甫赛先生进去探个究竟（他猜测可能是刚在那里抓住一个逃犯），但随后他非常慌忙地从里面跑出来。","Thus, we came to the village.The way by which we approached it, took us past the Three Jolly Bargemen, which we were surprised to find—it being eleven o’clock—in a state of commotion, with the door wide open, and unwonted lights that had been hastily caught up and put down, scattered about.Mr. Wopsle dropped in to ask what was the matter (surmising that a convict had been taken), but came running out in a great hurry."
"“出事了，”他不停脚地说道，“你家里出事了，皮普。快跑回家去！”","“There’s something wrong,” said he, without stopping, “up at your place, Pip.Run all!”"
"“出什么事了？”我紧跟上他问道。奥立克也跟在我旁边赶了上来。","“What is it?”I asked, keeping up with him.So did Orlick, at my side."
"“我不是很清楚。好像是在乔·格雷戈里不在家的时候，有人粗暴地闯了进去。应该是逃犯干的。有人被打伤了。”","“I can’t quite understand.The house seems to have been violently entered when Joe Gargery was out.Supposed by convicts.Somebody has been attacked and hurt.”"
"我们跑得太快，连话都说不出来了，我们就这样一口气跑到我家厨房。厨房里都是人，整个村子里的人都来了。有的人站在院子里，一名外科医生和乔还有一群妇女都站在厨房中央。那些纯粹的旁观者看到我之后向后退了几步，这样我才看到我姐姐——她毫无意识、一动不动地躺在光光的地板上。在她面朝着炉火的时候，不知是谁在她脑后狠狠地打了一下，把她打昏过去了——我意识到，作为乔的妻子，她注定再也不能大发脾气了。","We were running too fast to admit of more being said, and we made no stop until we got into our kitchen.It was full of people; the whole village was there, or in the yard; and there was a surgeon, and there was Joe, and there was a group of women, all on the floor in the midst of the kitchen.The unemployed bystanders drew back when they saw me, and so I became aware of my sister—lying without sense or movement on the bare boards where she had been knocked down by a tremendous blow on the back of the head, dealt by some unknown hand when her face was turned towards the fire—destined never to be on the Rampage again, while she was the wife of Joe."
"第十六章","Chapter 16"
"我满脑子都是乔治·巴恩韦尔，所以我一开始就很自然地相信，我一定跟我姐姐被打这件事有关，或者无论如何，作为她的近亲，大家都知道我是由她来抚养的，与其他任何人相比，我都是一个更加合情合理的怀疑对象。但是第二天早上，当光线更明朗的时候，我开始重新考虑这件事，听周围的人讨论这件事，所以我就对这个案件有了另一种更加合理的看法。","With my head full of George Barnwell, I was at first disposed to believe that I must have had some hand in the attack upon my sister, or at all events that as her near relation, popularly known to be under obligations to her, I was a more legitimate object of suspicion than any one else.But when, in the clearer light of next morning, I began to reconsider the matter and to hear it discussed around me on all sides, I took another view of the case, which was more reasonable."
"乔昨天晚上从八时一刻到九时三刻一直都在“三个快活船员”酒馆里抽烟。当乔在那里的时候，有人看到我姐姐站在厨房门口，与一个回家途中经过的农场工人互道晚安。这个人只能确定他是在九点之前见到她的，无法提供更加确切的时间了（他愈想确切就愈加糊涂）。当乔在差五分十点回到家的时候，发现她被打倒在地，他马上找人来帮忙。当时炉火还在像平常一样燃烧着，蜡烛的烛花也不是很长，但是蜡烛都被吹灭了。","Joe had been at the Three Jolly Bargemen, smoking his pipe, from a quarter after eight o’clock to a quarter before ten.While he was there, my sister had been seen standing at the kitchen door, and had exchanged Good Night with a farm-laborer going home.The man could not be more particular as to the time at which he saw her (he got into dense confusion when he tried to be), than that it must have been before nine.When Joe went home at five minutes before ten, he found her struck down on the floor, and promptly called in assistance.The fire had not then burnt unusually low, nor was the snuff of the candle very long; the candle, however, had been blown out."
"房子里没有任何东西被拿走。蜡烛是摆放在位于我姐姐和门之间的一张桌子上，我姐姐被袭击的时候+B17背对着这张桌子，面朝着火炉。除了蜡烛被吹灭了之外，厨房里没有任何被动过的迹象，即使有也是我姐姐自己倒下流血造成的。但是，现场有一件非常重要的证据。她是被一种很重的钝器所袭击的，凶器打在她的头部和脊骨。这一下打过之后，在她面朝下地倒在地板上的时候，凶手又极其凶狠地朝她扔了一种很重的东西。当乔把她抱起来之后，在她身旁的地板上发现一副逃犯戴的铁镣铐，这副铁镣铐是被锉开的。","Nothing had been taken away from any part of the house.Neither, beyond the blowing out of the candle—which stood on a table between the door and my sister, and was behind her when she stood facing the fire and was struck—was there any disarrangement of the kitchen, excepting such as she herself had made, in falling and bleeding.But, there was one remarkable piece of evidence on the spot.She had been struck with something blunt and heavy, on the head and spine; after the blows were dealt, something heavy had been thrown down at her with considerable violence, as she lay on her face.And on the ground beside her, when Joe picked her up, was a convict’s leg-iron which had been filed asunder."
"如今，乔用铁匠的眼光检查了这副铁镣铐之后断定，它已经被锉开有一段时间了。监狱船受到强烈的指责，那里的人前来检查这副铁镣铐，乔的观点得到了证实。虽然这副铁镣铐之前无疑是属于监狱船的，但他们不敢保证说它是什么时候被戴着离开船的。不过他们声称，这副铁镣铐肯定不是昨天晚上逃跑的那两名犯人的。而且，其中一个已经被抓回来了，他并没有自己打开铁镣铐。","Now, Joe, examining this iron with a smith’s eye, declared it to have been filed asunder some time ago.The hue and cry going off to the Hulks, and people coming thence to examine the iron, Joe’s opinion was corroborated.They did not undertake to say when it had left the prison-ships to which it undoubtedly had once belonged; but they claimed to know for certain that that particular manacle had not been worn by either of the two convicts who had escaped last night.Further, one of those two was already re-taken, and had not freed himself of his iron."
"根据我所知道的情况，我在这里讲一下我自己的推断。我认为，这副铁镣铐是我认识的那个逃犯的——我之前在沼泽地上见过这副铁镣铐，也听到他锉铁镣铐的声音——但我不认为是他用这副铁镣铐行凶的。因为，我相信是另外两个人中的某一个拿到了这副铁镣铐，把它变成了这种残忍凶器。这个人不是奥立克就是那个朝我挥舞锉子的人。","Knowing what I knew, I set up an inference of my own here.I believed the iron to be my convict’s iron—the iron I had seen and heard him filing at, on the marshes—but my mind did not accuse him of having put it to its latest use.For, I believed one of two other persons to have become possessed of it, and to have turned it to this cruel account.Either Orlick, or the strange man who had shown me the file."
"现在先说奥立克，就像我们在公路上遇见他时他告诉我们的那样，他到镇上去了，整个晚上他都在镇上闲逛，去了几个酒馆和酒鬼们混在一起，然后他和我还有沃甫赛先生一起回来了。除了和我姐姐吵架了之外，没有什么对他是不利的。而且我姐姐和他以及她身边的其他人都吵过成千上万次架了。至于那个陌生人，要是他回来索要他那两张钞票的话，根本不会有什么争端，因为我姐姐已经做好准备要还给他了。而且本来就没有什么争吵，那个行凶者进来地太安静、太突然，她没来得及回头就被打倒了。","Now, as to Orlick; he had gone to town exactly as he told us when we picked him up at the turnpike, he had been seen about town all the evening, he had been in divers companies in several public-houses, and he had come back with myself and Mr. Wopsle.There was nothing against him, save the quarrel; and my sister had quarreled with him, and with everybody else about her, ten thousand times.As to the strange man; if he had come back for his two bank-notes there could have been no dispute about them, because my sister was fully prepared to restore them.Besides, there had been no altercation; the assailant had come in so silently and suddenly, that she had been felled before she could look round."
"只要一想到是我提供了凶器，虽然不是有意的，我还是感到心惊肉跳的，但又不能不这么想。我忍受着不可名状的痛苦，思前想后，考虑我是否应该最终驱散我童年时的魔咒，把事情全部告诉乔。在接下来的几个月当中，我每天都会最后给这个问题以否定答案，然后第二天早上又重新考虑，重新挣扎。然而最终我的结论是——这个秘密时间太久了，它已经融入我的身体，成为我的一部分了，所以我无法把它撕走。我害怕的是，由于我已经给乔带来了很大的伤害，要是乔相信了我的话，他很可能自此疏远我。另外我不敢说出来是因为我更害怕他不相信，而是把它当成和那些大狗及小牛排一样骇人的谎话。但是，我最后打定主意不这么快就做决定——因为，既然事已至此，我为什么还要在是非之间徘徊呢？——我决定，只要我有新的机遇能帮忙找到那个袭击者的话，到时候我一定会全盘托出。","It was horrible to think that I had provided the weapon, however undesignedly, but I could hardly think otherwise.I suffered unspeakable trouble while I considered and reconsidered whether I should at last dissolve that spell of my childhood, and tell Joe all the story.For months afterwards, I every day settled the question finally in the negative, and reopened and reargued it next morning.The contention came, after all, to this;—the secret was such an old one now, had so grown into me and become a part of myself, that I could not tear it away.In addition to the dread that, having led up to so much mischief, it would be now more likely than ever to alienate Joe from me if he believed it, I had a further restraining dread that he would not believe it, but would assort it with the fabulous dogs and veal-cutlets as a monstrous invention.However, I temporized with myself, of course—for, was I not wavering between right and wrong, when the thing is always done?—and resolved to make a full disclosure if I should see any such new occasion as a new chance of helping in the discovery of the assailant."
"地方巡警和来自伦敦鲍街的警察——因为在那个年头里，穿红背心的警察在伦敦之外的地方已经绝迹了——在房子周围调查了一两个星期。他们的所作所为就跟我之前听到的或读到的有关当局在处理其他类似案件时所做的一样。他们抓来几个明显错误的怀疑对象，然后绞尽脑汁地推翻错误的结论。他们坚持非要让实际情况符合结论，而不是尽力从实际情况中得出结论。他们还在“三个快活船员”酒馆门口站岗。他们脸上世故又冷漠的表情让整个村子都赞叹不已。他们喝酒的方式几乎跟他们抓罪犯的手法一样神秘。但又不完全相像，因为他们从来没有抓到过罪犯。","The Constables, and the Bow Street men from London—for, this happened in the days of the extinct red-waistcoated police—were about the house for a week or two, and did pretty much what I have heard and read of like authorities doing in other such cases.They took up several obviously wrong people, and they ran their heads very hard against wrong ideas, and persisted in trying to fit the circumstances to the ideas, instead of trying to extract ideas from the circumstances.Also, they stood about the door of the Jolly Bargemen, with knowing and reserved looks that filled the whole neighborhood with admiration; and they had a mysterious manner of taking their drink, that was almost as good as taking the culprit.But not quite, for they never did it."
"在这些政府派来的警察撤走之后很长一段时间里，我姐姐都重病卧床。她的视力受到了影响，所以她看东西都会有幻影，伸手去抓的是茶杯和酒杯的影像而不是真实的东西。她的听力受到严重损伤，记忆力也是，她说的话让人听不懂。最后她终于恢复到在别人的帮助下能够下楼了。但这时仍然要让她随身带着我的石板，这样她就能把她说不出来的话写下来。由于她（除了字迹很差之外）的拼写很差，而乔的阅读能力也很差，所以他们之间就会出现很复杂的问题，我经常被叫过去解决问题。她要药，拿来的却是羊肉；她找乔，端来的却是茶；她要腊肉，找来的却是面包师傅，这些都只是我最小的错误而已。","Long after these constitutional powers had dispersed, my sister lay very ill in bed.Her sight was disturbed, so that she saw objects multiplied, and grasped at visionary teacups and wine-glasses instead of the realities; her hearing was greatly impaired; her memory also; and her speech was unintelligible.When, at last, she came round so far as to be helped down-stairs, it was still necessary to keep my slate always by her, that she might indicate in writing what she could not indicate in speech.As she was (very bad handwriting apart) a more than indifferent speller, and as Joe was a more than indifferent reader, extraordinary complications arose between them, which I was always called in to solve.The administration of mutton instead of medicine, the substitution of Tea for Joe, and the baker for bacon, were among the mildest of my own mistakes."
"但是，她的脾气有很大的好转，变得耐心了。她的四肢在行动时会打颤，这不久就成为她的一种常态。之后每隔两三个月，她就会经常把手放在头上，情绪异常低落，而这种状态每次大概持续一个星期。我们不知道到哪里为她找一个合适的护理人员，恰巧这时发生了一件事情，解决了我们的难题。沃甫赛先生的姑婆战胜了她养成的顽固的生活习惯，同意让比迪来到我们家照顾我姐姐。","However, her temper was greatly improved, and she was patient.A tremulous uncertainty of the action of all her limbs soon became a part of her regular state, and afterwards, at intervals of two or three months, she would often put her hands to her head, and would then remain for about a week at a time in some gloomy aberration of mind.We were at a loss to find a suitable attendant for her, until a circumstance happened conveniently to relieve us.Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt conquered a confirmed habit of living into which she had fallen, and Biddy became a part of our establishment."
"大概在我姐姐再次出现在厨房里的一个月之后，比迪来到我们家，带着一个满是斑点的小箱子，装着她所有的家当，她成了我们家的福音。最重要的是，她是乔的福音，因为这位亲爱的老兄时常一想起他妻子病恹恹的样子就悲痛不已。每当晚上服侍在她左右的时候，乔已经习惯不时找到我，睁着泪汪汪的蓝色眼睛对我说：“她曾经是多么美丽的女人啊，皮普！”比迪立刻熟练地接过照顾我姐姐的工作，仿佛她从我姐姐还是个婴儿的时候就很了解她似的。乔因此能够享受更宁静的生活，不时地到“三个快活船员”酒馆那里去放松身心。警察们特有的敏感性让他们或多或少地怀疑可怜的乔（尽管他从来都不知道这一点），他们一致认为乔是他们所遇到过的最捉摸不定的人物之一。","It may have been about a month after my sister’s reappearance in the kitchen, when Biddy came to us with a small speckled box containing the whole of her worldly effects, and became a blessing to the household.Above all, she was a blessing to Joe, for the dear old fellow was sadly cut up by the constant contemplation of the wreck of his wife, and had been accustomed, while attending on her of an evening, to turn to me every now and then and say, with his blue eyes moistened, “Such a fine figure of a woman as she once were, Pip!”Biddy instantly taking the cleverest charge of her as though she had studied her from infancy, Joe became able in some sort to appreciate the greater quiet of his life, and to get down to the Jolly Bargemen now and then for a change that did him good.It was characteristic of the police people that they had all more or less suspected poor Joe (though he never knew it), and that they had to a man concurred in regarding him as one of the deepest spirits they had ever encountered."
"比迪上任以来的第一次大捷就是解决了一个把我彻底击败了的难题。我曾使出浑身解数来解决这个难题，但一点成效也没有。事情是这样的：","Biddy’s first triumph in her new office, was to solve a difficulty that had completely vanquished me.I had tried hard at it, but had made nothing of it.Thus it was:"
"我姐姐一次又一次地在石板上画出一个有点像T的奇怪的字母，然后她非常急切地拿给我们看，好像她特别想要什么东西。我已经找来所有以T开头的东西，从柏油到吐司再到桶，但全都不对。最后我想到，这个符号看起来像把锤子。当我使劲地在她耳边喊起这个词的时候，她开始捶打桌子，以表示对我的同意。于是我马上把我们所有的锤子一只接一只地拿过来，但都不是她想要的。然后我想起拐杖的形状也很接近这个符号。于是我从村子里借来一只拐杖，信心十足地拿给我姐姐看。但是她一看到拐杖就拼命地摇头，我们都害怕她在这么虚弱、这么崩溃的状态下，如此猛烈的摇头会让她的脖子错位。","Again and again and again, my sister had traced upon the slate, a character that looked like a curious T, and then with the utmost eagerness had called our attention to it as something she particularly wanted.I had in vain tried everything producible that began with a T, from tar to toast and tub.At length it had come into my head that the sign looked like a hammer, and on my lustily calling that word in my sister’s ear, she had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a qualified assent.Thereupon, I had brought in all our hammers, one after another, but without avail.Then I bethought me of a crutch, the shape being much the same, and I borrowed one in the village, and displayed it to my sister with considerable confidence.But she shook her head to that extent when she was shown it, that we were terrified lest in her weak and shattered state she should dislocate her neck."
"当我姐姐发现比迪能很快就明白她的意思时，她又在石板上画出这个神秘的符号。比迪若有所思地看着它，听了我的解释，然后若有所思地看看我姐姐，又若有所思地看看乔（乔在石板上总是用自己名字的首字母来表示自己），然后跑进铁匠铺，我和乔跟了过去。","When my sister found that Biddy was very quick to understand her, this mysterious sign reappeared on the slate.Biddy looked thoughtfully at it, heard my explanation, looked thoughtfully at my sister, looked thoughtfully at Joe (who was always represented on the slate by his initial letter), and ran into the forge, followed by Joe and me."
"“对，一定是这样！”比迪满脸喜悦地喊道，“你们没看出来吗？是他！”","“Why, of course!” cried Biddy, with an exultant face.“Don’t you see?It’s him!”"
"奥立克，毫无疑问！我姐姐已经忘记了他的名字，只能用他的锤子来代表他。我们告诉他我们要他到厨房里去的原因，他慢慢地放下他的锤子，拿胳膊擦了一下额头，又用他的围裙擦了一下额头，然后慢悠悠地走过来。他的膝盖奇怪、懒散地打着弯，这是他最大的特色。","Orlick, without a doubt!She had lost his name, and could only signify him by his hammer.We told him why we wanted him to come into the kitchen, and he slowly laid down his hammer, wiped his brow with his arm, took another wipe at it with his apron, and came slouching out, with a curious loose vagabond bend in the knees that strongly distinguished him."
"我承认，我以为我姐姐会当面揭发他。而让我大失所望的是，结果与我想的完全不同。她表现出急于要与他和好的强烈欲望，显然非常高兴终于把他找来了，而且示意想让他喝点什么。她观察着他的脸色，仿佛她特别希望要确保他友好地接受对他的款待。她表现出强烈的欲望要与他和解，一举一动之中都显示出谦卑的赎罪之情，就像我见过的小孩子站在一位严师的面前认错一样。那天之后，几乎没有哪一天我姐姐不在石板上画出这把锤子，没有哪一天奥立克不慢悠悠地走进来，固执地站在她面前，仿佛他和我一样，不知道如何是好。","I confess that I expected to see my sister denounce him, and that I was disappointed by the different result.She manifested the greatest anxiety to be on good terms with him, was evidently much pleased by his being at length produced, and motioned that she would have him given something to drink.She watched his countenance as if she were particularly wishful to be assured that he took kindly to his reception, she showed every possible desire to conciliate him, and there was an air of humble propitiation in all she did, such as I have seen pervade the bearing of a child towards a hard master.After that day, a day rarely passed without her drawing the hammer on her slate, and without Orlick’s slouching in and standing doggedly before her, as if he knew no more than I did what to make of it."

"我现在陷入了一种一成不变的、程式化的学徒生活，没有什么富于变化的情况能让我超出村庄和沼泽的界限，除了在我生日来临那天我重新拜访了郝维仙小姐。我发现萨拉·鄱凯特小姐仍然在门口当差。我发现郝维仙小姐就跟我上次离开她的时候一样，她以同样的方式说起埃斯特拉，即使用词并不是跟上次完全一样。这次见面只持续了几分钟而已，我临走的时候她给了我一个几尼，告诉我明年生日的时候再来。我现在要提及的是，此后这就成为每年的一种惯例。第一次的时候我竭力拒绝收下这个几尼，但除了让她生气地质问我是不是想要更多之外，没达到什么好的效果。于是，那一次以及以后的每一次我都收下了她给我的几尼。","I now fell into a regular routine of apprenticeship life, which was varied, beyond the limits of the village and the marshes, by no more remarkable circumstance than the arrival of my birthday and my paying another visit to Miss Havisham.I found Miss Sarah Pocket still on duty at the gate, I found Miss Havisham just as I had left her, and she spoke of Estella in the very same way, if not in the very same words.The interview lasted but a few minutes, and she gave me a guinea when I was going, and told me to come again on my next birthday.I may mention at once that this became an annual custom.I tried to decline taking the guinea on the first occasion, but with no better effect than causing her to ask me very angrily, if I expected more?Then, and after that, I took it."
"沉闷的旧宅邸，黑房间里昏黄的灯光，坐在梳妆镜旁椅子上那形销骨立的幽灵，这一切都那么一成不变，让我感觉仿佛钟表的停止已经冻结了这个神秘场所里的时间，这个地方之外的一切事物和我都在变老，而它却静止不动。阳光从来没有射进这座宅邸，也没有射进我对它的所有的看法和记忆里。它迷惑了我，在它的影响之下，我继续从心底里憎恶我的行当，为我的家而感到羞耻。","So unchanging was the dull old house, the yellow light in the darkened room, the faded specter in the chair by the dressing-table glass, that I felt as if the stopping of the clocks had stopped Time in that mysterious place, and, while I and everything else outside it grew older, it stood still.Daylight never entered the house as to my thoughts and remembrances of it, any more than as to the actual fact.It bewildered me, and under its influence I continued at heart to hate my trade and to be ashamed of home."
"然而，我开始察觉到比迪身上非常细微的变化。她穿上了高跟鞋，头发变得整齐而有光泽，她的手也总是很干净。她并不漂亮——她相貌平平，不像埃斯特拉那样——但她友好可亲、心地善良、秉性温和。她来我们家只有差不多一年的时间（我记得她刚刚换下丧服的时候我被震惊了），一天晚上我发现她有一双异常深邃而专注的眼睛，一双非常漂亮、非常好看的眼睛。","Imperceptibly I became conscious of a change in Biddy, however.Her shoes came up at the heel, her hair grew bright and neat, her hands were always clean.She was not beautiful—she was common, and could not be like Estella—but she was pleasant and wholesome and sweet-tempered.She had not been with us more than a year (I remember her being newly out of mourning at the time it struck me), when I observed to myself one evening that she had curiously thoughtful and attentive eyes; eyes that were very pretty and very good."
"这个发现是在我放下手中正在仔细完成的任务，抬起眼的时候观察到的——我当时正在抄写一本书上的某些段落，这是一种能够同时提高我两方面能力的策略——我看到比迪注意到我正在做的事情。我放下笔，比迪停下了手中的针线活但并没有放下来。","It came of my lifting up my own eyes from a task I was poring at—writing some passages from a book, to improve myself in two ways at once by a sort of stratagem—and seeing Biddy observant of what I was about.I laid down my pen, and Biddy stopped in her needlework without laying it down."
"“比迪，”我说，“你是怎么办到的？　要么是我太笨了，要么是你太聪明了。”","“Biddy,” said I, “how do you manage it?Either I am very stupid, or you are very clever.”"
"“我办到什么了？我怎么不知道。”比迪笑着回答说。","“What is it that I manage?I don’t know,” returned Biddy, smiling."
"她打理我们所有的家务活，而且料理得非常好，但我并不是指这一方面，尽管很奇怪的是，这一方面更能凸显我的本意。","She managed our whole domestic life, and wonderfully too; but I did not mean that, though that made what I did mean, more surprising."
"“你是怎么办到的，比迪，”我说，“学会我所学的一切，并且总是能跟上我？”那时我正开始因自己掌握的知识而样样自得，因为我把生日得来的几尼都花在了学习上，而且把我大部分的零花钱省下来用做类似的投资。但是我现在毫不怀疑地相信，我为所知道的那点知识付出了极其高的代价。","“How do you manage, Biddy,” said I, “to learn everything that I learn, and always to keep up with me?”I was beginning to be rather vain of my knowledge, for I spent my birthday guineas on it, and set aside the greater part of my pocket-money for similar investment; though I have no doubt, now, that the little I knew was extremely dear at the price."
"“我还想问你呢，”比迪说，“你是怎么办到的？”","“I might as well ask you,” said Biddy, “how you manage?”"
"“这不一样，因为每天晚上我从铁匠铺回来之后，任何人都会看到我开始学习。但你从来就没有特意学习过，比迪。”","“No; because when I come in from the forge of a night, any one can see me turning to at it.But you never turn to at it, Biddy.”"
"“我想我一定是被感染了——就像感冒咳嗽一样。”比迪轻轻地说道，然后继续做她的针线活。","“I suppose I must catch it—like a cough,” said Biddy, quietly; and went on with her sewing."
"我一边继续想着心事，一边向后倚靠在我的木椅上，同时看着比迪把头歪向一边做着针线活，我开始觉得比迪是个非常了不起的女孩。因为，我现在想起来她同样熟知我们这个行当的术语，知晓我们不同工作种类的名称以及各式各样工具的名字。总之，凡是我知道的，比迪都知道。理论上，她已经是一个和我一样棒的铁匠了，甚至比我还要出色。","Pursuing my idea as I leaned back in my wooden chair and looked at Biddy sewing away with her head on one side, I began to think her rather an extraordinary girl.For, I called to mind now, that she was equally accomplished in the terms of our trade, and the names of our different sorts of work, and our various tools.In short, whatever I knew, Biddy knew.Theoretically, she was already as good a blacksmith as I, or better."
"“你是那种人，比迪，”我说，“那种充分利用每一个机会的人。你来这里之前从来没有任何机会，但看看你现在进步多大！”","“You are one of those, Biddy,” said I, “who make the most of every chance.You never had a chance before you came here, and see how improved you are!”"
"比迪看了我一眼，然后继续做她的针线活。“但是，我曾经是你的第一个老师，是不是？”比迪一边做针线活一边说。","Biddy looked at me for an instant, and went on with her sewing.“I was your first teacher though; wasn’t I?” said she, as she sewed. "
"“比迪！”我惊讶地喊道，“怎么了，你哭啦！”","“Biddy!” I exclaimed, in amazement.“Why, you are crying!”"
"“没有，我没哭，”比迪抬起头笑着说道，“你怎么会这么说呢？”","“No I am not,” said Biddy, looking up and laughing.“What put that in your head?”"
"除了那滴落在她针线活上的晶莹泪珠之外，什么会让我这么说呢？我默默地坐着，想到她在沃甫赛先生的姑婆成功地克服了糟糕的生活习惯之前是个多么劳累的苦工，别人都多么想摆脱那个老太婆。我想到她之前身处的那种无助的境地，不仅要打理那个简陋的小商店和那个条件恶劣、吵吵闹闹的小夜校，还要照顾那个令人厌烦的老太婆——这老太婆的生活不能自理，总是要别人搀扶着。我想到即使是在那种不幸的环境当中，比迪身上也隐藏着那些如今正在发挥出来的美好潜质。所以，在我最初感到忧虑与不满的时候，我就去找她帮忙，这是理所当然的。比迪静静地坐在那里干针线活，没有再掉眼泪。当我看着她、想着这一切的时候，我突然觉得，也许自己没有向比迪充分表达我的感激之情。我可能太内向了，我应该充满自信地把我的秘密更多地赐予她（尽管我想的时候并不是用赐予这个词）。","What could have put it in my head, but the glistening of a tear as it dropped on her work?I sat silent, recalling what a drudge she had been until Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt successfully overcame that bad habit of living, so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people.I recalled the hopeless circumstances by which she had been surrounded in the miserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school, with that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged and shouldered.I reflected that even in those untoward times there must have been latent in Biddy what was now developing, for, in my first uneasiness and discontent I had turned to her for help, as a matter of course.Biddy sat quietly sewing, shedding no more tears, and while I looked at her and thought about it all, it occurred to me that perhaps I had not been sufficiently grateful to Biddy.I might have been too reserved, and should have patronized her more (though I did not use that precise word in my meditations), with my confidence."
"“是啊，比迪，”我仔细想了想之后说道，“你曾经是我的第一个老师，那时候我们没想到会像这样一起坐在厨房里。”","“Yes, Biddy,” I observed, when I had done turning it over, “you were my first teacher, and that at a time when we little thought of ever being together like this, in this kitchen.”"
"“唉，可怜的人啊！”比迪回答说。她就像把自己给忘了一样，将话题转向我姐姐，站起身来在她周围忙来忙去，让她更舒服一些。“真是不幸啊！”","“Ah, poor thing!” replied Biddy.It was like her self-forgetfulness, to transfer the remark to my sister, and to get up and be busy about her, making her more comfortable; “that’s sadly true!”"
"“唉！”我说，“我们必须像以前那样一起多说说话。而且我必须像以前那样多请教你。我们下个星期日一起去沼泽地那边安静地散散步吧，比迪，好好地聊一聊。”","“Well!” said I, “we must talk together a little more, as we used to do.And I must consult you a little more, as I used to do.Let us have a quiet walk on the marshes next Sunday, Biddy, and a long chat.”"
"我姐姐如今不能被独自留下，但那个星期日下午，乔非常乐意地留下照顾她，于是我和比迪就一起出去了。那是个天气很好的夏日。我们走过了村庄、教堂以及墓地，来到了沼泽地。当我看到驶过的船只上扬起白帆的时候，我开始将郝维仙小姐和埃斯特拉与景色结合起来，就像往常那样。我们来到河边，坐在河堤上，河水在我们脚下潺潺地流过，这声音让周围的一切更显安静。这时我决定，此时此地正是让比迪知道我内心秘密的好机会。","My sister was never left alone now; but Joe more than readily undertook the care of her on that Sunday afternoon, and Biddy and I went out together.It was summer-time, and lovely weather.When we had passed the village and the church and the churchyard, and were out on the marshes and began to see the sails of the ships as they sailed on, I began to combine Miss Havisham and Estella with the prospect, in my usual way.When we came to the river-side and sat down on the bank, with the water rippling at our feet, making it all more quiet than it would have been without that sound, I resolved that it was a good time and place for the admission of Biddy into my inner confidence."
"“比迪，”在我叫她保守秘密之后我说道，“我想要成为上流社会的绅士。”","“Biddy,” said I, after binding her to secrecy, “I want to be a gentleman.”"
"“噢，如果我是你的话，我才不想呢！”她回答说，“我觉得那不适合你。”","“Oh, I wouldn’t, if I was you!” she returned.“I don’t think it would answer.”"
"“比迪，”我严肃地说，“我想成为绅士是有特别的理由的。”","“Biddy,” said I, with some severity, “I have particular reasons for wanting to be a gentleman.”"
"“你明白事理，皮普，但你不觉得，就像你现在这样，你会更快乐吗？”","“You know best, Pip; but don’t you think you are happier as you are?”"
"“比迪，”我不耐烦地喊道，“像我现在这样，我一点都不快乐。我厌恶我的行当和我的生活。自从我当了学徒以来，我就从来没有喜欢过任何一样。别荒唐了。”","“Biddy,” I exclaimed, impatiently, “I am not at all happy as I am.I am disgusted with my calling and with my life.I have never taken to either, since I was bound.Don’t be absurd.”"
"“我很荒唐吗？”比迪轻轻地扬起眉毛说道，“对不起，我并不是这个意思。我只想你过得好，过得舒服。”","“Was I absurd?” said Biddy, quietly raising her eyebrows; “I am sorry for that; I didn’t mean to be.I only want you to do well, and to be comfortable.”"
"“那么，好吧，干脆就直说吧，我在那里永远不会、也不能舒服——除了痛苦没有别的，比迪！——除非我能过上一种与我眼下所过的完全不同的生活。”","“Well then, understand once for all that I never shall or can be comfortable—or anything but miserable—there, Biddy!—unless I can lead a very different sort of life from the life I lead now.”"
"“这太遗憾了！”比迪说着悲伤地摇了摇头。","“That’s a pity!” said Biddy, shaking her head with a sorrowful air."
"那时，我一直在进行自我思想斗争之中，也经常觉得很遗憾，所以当比迪说出她的感想，也是我的感想的时候，我都差不多要留下悲伤、痛哭的眼泪了。我告诉她她说得对，我知道这非常令人遗憾，但我无能为力。","Now, I too had so often thought it a pity, that, in the singular kind of quarrel with myself which I was always carrying on, I was half inclined to shed tears of vexation and distress when Biddy gave utterance to her sentiment and my own.I told her she was right, and I knew it was much to be regretted, but still it was not to be helped."
"“如果我能安定下来的话，”我对比迪说道，同时拔起我手边的矮草，就像我曾经揪着我的头发，猛踢酿酒作坊的墙壁来发泄情绪一样，“如果我能安定下来，对铁匠铺的喜爱有我小时候的一半那么多，我想情况对我来说也会好多了。那样你，我还有乔就会别无所求了，在我出徒之后乔和我也许就会合伙，我甚至可能长大成人之后成为你的伴侣，我们可能会在某个晴朗的星期天坐在同样的河堤上，虽然已经变得与以往的自己大不相同了。我本应该配得上你的，是不是，比迪？”","“If I could have settled down,” I said to Biddy, plucking up the short grass within reach, much as I had once upon a time pulled my feelings out of my hair and kicked them into the brewery wall: “if I could have settled down and been but half as fond of the forge as I was when I was little, I know it would have been much better for me.You and I and Joe would have wanted nothing then, and Joe and I would perhaps have gone partners when I was out of my time, and I might even have grown up to keep company with you, and we might have sat on this very bank on a fine Sunday, quite different people.I should have been good enough for you; shouldn’t I, Biddy?”"
"比迪看着船只驶过，叹了口气，回答说：“是啊，我不会太挑剔。”这听起来不是什么赞扬的话，但我知道她的本意是好的。","Biddy sighed as she looked at the ships sailing on, and returned for answer, “Yes; I am not over-particular.”It scarcely sounded flattering, but I knew she meant well."
"“但相反的是，”我说着又拔起一颗草，嚼了一两片叶子，“看看我现在成了什么样子。不满足、不如意，而且——要是没人告诉我的话，我怎么能知道自己是这么粗俗、平庸！”","“Instead of that,” said I, plucking up more grass and chewing a blade or two, “see how I am going on.Dissatisfied, and uncomfortable, and—what would it signify to me, being coarse and common, if nobody had told me so!”"
"比迪突然把脸转向我，用比她刚刚盯着航船时更为专注的眼神看着我。","Biddy turned her face suddenly towards mine, and looked far more attentively at me than she had looked at the sailing ships."
"“这些话不是真的，而且很不礼貌。”她说着又把目光转向了船只，“是谁这样说过？”","“It was neither a very true nor a very polite thing to say,” she remarked, directing her eyes to the ships again.“Who said it?”"
"我一下子手足无措，因为我虽然开了头，却不知道接下来该怎么说。但是眼下又不能逃脱，于是我回答道：“郝维仙小姐家那位漂亮小姐说的，她比任何人都要漂亮，我非常仰慕她，因为她，我想要成为一位绅士。”做了这番疯狂的坦白之后，我开始把我撕碎的草扔进河里，就像我也想随它而去一样。","I was disconcerted, for I had broken away without quite seeing where I was going to.It was not to be shuffled off now, however, and I answered, “The beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham’s, and she’s more beautiful than anybody ever was, and I admire her dreadfully, and I want to be a gentleman on her account.”Having made this lunatic confession, I began to throw my torn-up grass into the river, as if I had some thoughts of following it."
"“你想要成为一个绅士，是为了气她呢还是讨她欢心？”比迪停顿了一会儿之后轻轻地问我。","“Do you want to be a gentleman, to spite her or to gain her over?” Biddy quietly asked me, after a pause."
"“我不知道。”我闷闷不乐地回答道。","“I don’t know,” I moodily answered."
"“因为，如果是为了气她的话，”比迪继续说道，“我觉得——但你也明白事理——不理睬她的话也许能更好、更独立地达到这个效果。如果是为了讨她欢心的话，我觉得——但你也明白事理——她不值得你讨她欢心。”","“Because, if it is to spite her,” Biddy pursued, “I should think—but you know best—that might be better and more independently done by caring nothing for her words.And if it is to gain her over, I should think—but you know best—she was not worth gaining over.”"
"这正是我自己之前多次想过的。这正是眼下清清楚楚展现在我面前的事实。但是面对这个错综复杂的矛盾，连最聪慧、最明智的人每天都会身陷其中，我一个可怜而迷茫的乡村小伙子又怎能避免得了呢？","Exactly what I myself had thought, many times.Exactly what was perfectly manifest to me at the moment.But how could I, a poor dazed village lad, avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and wisest of men fall every day?"
"“这也许都很对，”我对比迪说，“但我非常仰慕她。”","“It may be all quite true,” said I to Biddy, “but I admire her dreadfully.”"
"总之，说这话的时候我转过去俯卧着，抓起我脑袋两边的头发，狠狠地揪。一直以来，我知道自己内心的狂热如此强烈而错位，我很清楚，即使我抓着头发把脸拎起来砸向鹅卵石，以惩罚它长在这样一个白痴身上，这对我的脸来说也是罪有应得。","In short, I turned over on my face when I came to that, and got a good grasp on the hair on each side of my head, and wrenched it well.All the while knowing the madness of my heart to be so very mad and misplaced, that I was quite conscious it would have served my face right, if I had lifted it up by my hair, and knocked it against the pebbles as a punishment for belonging to such an idiot."
"比迪是最聪明的女孩，她没有再努力给我讲道理。她把她的手放在我的手上，她的手尽管由于干活而变得粗糙却让人感到舒适。她温和地将我的手一只一只地从我的头发上拿下来。然后她轻轻地、抚慰式地拍着我的肩膀，我把脸掩在衣袖里哭了一会儿——就跟我在酿酒作坊的院子里所做的一样——我隐隐约约地确信，我被某个人或被每个人都狠狠地利用了，我说不清是哪种情况。","Biddy was the wisest of girls, and she tried to reason no more with me.She put her hand, which was a comfortable hand though roughened by work, upon my hands, one after another, and gently took them out of my hair.Then she softly patted my shoulder in a soothing way, while with my face upon my sleeve I cried a little—exactly as I had done in the brewery yard—and felt vaguely convinced that I was very much ill-used by somebody, or by everybody; I can’t say which."
"“有一件事情我很高兴，”比迪说，“那就是，你觉得你可以把你的秘密告诉我，皮普。另一件让我高兴的事就是，你知道你可以信任我保守秘密，并且永远能保守秘密。如果你的第一位老师（天哪！多么可怜的老师，她自己还有那么多需要学习！）眼下是你的老师，她想她知道该设置什么样的课程了。但是这堂课会很难学，而且你已经懂得比她多了，现在这已经没用了。”就这样，比迪轻轻地为我叹了口气，从河堤上站起来，改用一种轻松愉快的口气说道：“我们再往前走一会儿还是回家？”","“I am glad of one thing,” said Biddy, “and that is, that you have felt you could give me your confidence, Pip.And I am glad of another thing, and that is, that of course you know you may depend upon my keeping it and always so far deserving it.If your first teacher (dear! such a poor one, and so much in need of being taught herself!) had been your teacher at the present time, she thinks she knows what lesson she would set.But It would be a hard one to learn, and you have got beyond her, and it’s of no use now.”So, with a quiet sigh for me, Biddy rose from the bank, and said, with a fresh and pleasant change of voice, “Shall we walk a little further, or go home?”"
"“比迪，”我一边喊道，一边站起来，用胳膊搂住她的脖子，吻了她一下，“我会一直把所有事情都告诉你的。”","“Biddy,” I cried, getting up, putting my arm round her neck, and giving her a kiss, “I shall always tell you everything.”"
"“直到你成为一个绅士。”比迪说道。","“Till you’re a gentleman,” said Biddy."
"“你知道，我永远都不会成为绅士的，所以一直都会告诉你的。并不是我必须要告诉你什么，因为你知道我所知道的一切——就像前一天晚上我在家跟你说的一样。”","“You know I never shall be, so that’s always.Not that I have any occasion to tell you anything, for you know everything I know—as I told you at home the other night.”"
"“噢！”比迪低声轻轻地说道，同时转过去看着航船。然后她改用之前那种愉快的声音重复道：“我们是继续往前走一会儿呢还是回家？”","“Ah!” said Biddy, quite in a whisper, as she looked away at the ships.And then repeated, with her former pleasant change; “shall we walk a little further, or go home?”"
"我对比迪说我们再散一会儿步吧，于是我们就继续散步。夏日的午后渐渐柔和，变成了夏日的晚上，景色非常美。我开始思忖，我是否会更自然、更有益身心地融入这种环境当中，而不是在一个时钟停摆的房间里点着蜡烛玩牌，忍受着埃斯特拉的鄙视。我想，要是我能把她连同剩下的那些回忆以及幻想从我脑海中赶走的话，我的情况就会好多了，我会接受这份既定的工作，享受我该做的事情，坚持不懈，做到最好。我问我自己，我是不是肯定知道，如果眼下在我身边的人是埃斯特拉而不是比迪，她会不会让我很痛苦？　我必须承认，我有把握确定她会的。我对我自己说：“皮普，你这个大笨蛋！”","I said to Biddy we would walk a little further, and we did so, and the summer afternoon toned down into the summer evening, and it was very beautiful.I began to consider whether I was not more naturally and wholesomely situated, after all, in these circumstances, than playing beggar my neighbor by candlelight in the room with the stopped clocks, and being despised by Estella.I thought it would be very good for me if I could get her out of my head, with all the rest of those remembrances and fancies, and could go to work determined to relish what I had to do, and stick to it, and make the best of it.I asked myself the question whether I did not surely know that if Estella were beside me at that moment instead of Biddy, she would make me miserable?I was obliged to admit that I did know it for a certainty, and I said to myself, “Pip, what a fool you are!”"
"我们散步的时候谈了很多，比迪所说的话似乎都是对的。比迪从来不会出言不逊，或是反复无常，或今天是比迪，明天又变成另外一个人。她仅仅分担痛苦，而不会剥夺快乐，她不会给我带来痛苦，她宁愿伤她自己的心也不会让我伤心。为什么，在两个人当中我更喜欢的不是她呢？","We talked a good deal as we walked, and all that Biddy said seemed right.Biddy was never insulting, or capricious, or Biddy today and somebody else tomorrow; she would have derived only pain, and no pleasure, from giving me pain; she would far rather have wounded her own breast than mine.How could it be, then, that I did not like her much the better of the two?"
"“比迪，”当我们往家走的时候我说，“我希望你能让我走上正路。”","“Biddy,” said I, when we were walking homeward, “I wish you could put me right.”"
"“但愿我可以！”比迪说。","“I wish I could!” said Biddy."
"“要是我能让自己爱上你该多好啊——你不会介意我这么直接地跟老朋友说话吧？”","“If I could only get myself to fall in love with you—you don’t mind my speaking so openly to such an old acquaintance?”"
"“哦，亲爱的，一点也不介意！”比迪说，“不用在意我。”","“Oh dear, not at all!” said Biddy.“Don’t mind me.”"
"“要是我能让自己做到的话，那就是我的一大幸事了。”","“If I could only get myself to do it, that would be the thing for me.”"
"“但你永远都办不到的，你知道。”比迪说。","“But you never will, you see,” said Biddy."
"要是那天晚上我们提前几个小时讨论这个话题的话，我觉得它就不会看起来像现在这样不可能发生。所以我说我对此并不是很有把握。但比迪说她有把握，而且她说得很肯定。我心里相信她是对的，然而看到她在这一点上如此肯定，我还是很难受。","It did not appear quite so unlikely to me that evening, as it would have done if we had discussed it a few hours before.I therefore observed I was not quite sure of that.But Biddy said she was, and she said it decisively.In my heart I believed her to be right; and yet I took it rather ill, too, that she should be so positive on the point."
"走近墓地的时候，我们得穿过一道堤坝，跨过闸门附近的一道栅栏。就在这时，不知是从闸门还是草丛或是淤泥（淤泥就像他一样呆滞、污浊）里跳出一个人，是老奥立克。","When we came near the churchyard, we had to cross an embankment, and get over a stile near a sluice gate.There started up, from the gate, or from the rushes, or from the ooze (which was quite in his stagnant way), Old Orlick."
"“嗨！”他吼道，“你们两个去哪里？”","“Halloa!” he growled, “where are you two going?”"
"“除了回家，我们俩还能去哪里？”","“Where should we be going, but home?”"
"“那好吧，”他说，“要是我不把你们送回家的话，我就会被千刀万剐的！”","“Well then,” said he, “I’m jiggered if I don’t see you home!”"
"被千刀万剐的刑罚是他最喜欢的一种假定情况。我知道，他说这个词没有特定的含义，而是像用他瞎编的教名一样用这个词来冒犯别人，表示某件东西被残忍地破坏了。在我小一点的时候，我相信要是他亲自对我施行千刀万剐，他会用一把锋利、扭曲的铁钩。","This penalty of being jiggered was a favorite supposititious case of his.He attached no definite meaning to the word that I am aware of, but used it, like his own pretended Christian name, to affront mankind, and convey an idea of something savagely damaging.When I was younger, I had had a general belief that if he had jiggered me personally, he would have done it with a sharp and twisted hook."
"比迪极其反对他和我们一道回去，她小声对我说：“别让他跟来，我不喜欢他。”由于我也不喜欢他，所以我毫不客气地说我们很感谢他，但我们不想他送我们回家。他听了之后大笑了一声，退了回去，但是却慢悠悠地跟在我们身后不远处。","Biddy was much against his going with us, and said to me in a whisper, “Don’t let him come; I don’t like him.”As I did not like him either, I took the liberty of saying that we thanked him, but we didn’t want seeing home.He received that piece of information with a yell of laughter, and dropped back, but came slouching after us at a little distance."
"我很好奇地想知道，是不是比迪怀疑他跟那次谋杀性的袭击有关——我姐姐永远都无法解释清楚那次袭击案——所以我问她，为什么她不喜欢他。","Curious to know whether Biddy suspected him of having had a hand in that murderous attack of which my sister had never been able to give any account, I asked her why she did not like him."
"“哦！”她转头看了一眼慢悠悠地跟在我们后面的奥立克，回答道，“因为我——我想他喜欢上我了。”","“Oh!” she replied, glancing over her shoulder as he slouched after us, “because I—I am afraid he likes me.”"
"“他有告诉过你说他喜欢你吗？”我愤愤不平地问。","“Did he ever tell you he liked you?” I asked indignantly."
"“没有，”比迪又转头看了一眼，说道，“他从来没有这样说过，但他只要看到我就对我手舞足蹈。”","“No,” said Biddy, glancing over her shoulder again, “he never told me so; but he dances at me, whenever he can catch my eye.”"
"不管这番被爱慕的证词多么新奇、多么奇特，我并不怀疑对其解释的准确性。老奥立克竟敢对她表示爱慕，对此我真是特别气愤，就像这是对我的一种暴行一样气愤。","However novel and peculiar this testimony of attachment, I did not doubt the accuracy of the interpretation.I was very hot indeed upon Old Orlick’s daring to admire her; as hot as if it were an outrage on myself."
"“不过这事与你无关，你知道的。”比迪平静地说道。","“But it makes no difference to you, you know,” said Biddy, calmly."
"“是的，比迪，这事跟我无关，但是我不喜欢这样，我不同意。”","“No, Biddy, it makes no difference to me; only I don’t like it; I don’t approve of it.”"
"“我也不同意。”比迪说，“不过还是和你无关。”","“Nor I neither,” said Biddy.“Though that makes no difference to you.”"
"“的确，”我说，“但我必须要告诉你，如果你允许他在你面前手舞足蹈的话，我就会对你有意见的。”","“Exactly,” said I; “but I must tell you I should have no opinion of you, Biddy, if he danced at you with your own consent.”"
"那天晚上之后，我就密切注意着奥立克。不管什么时候，只要他一有机会在比迪面前手舞足蹈，我就挡在他前面，遮住他的表演。由于我姐姐突然开始喜欢他，所以他在乔的铁匠铺里地位牢固，否则我早就设法开除他了。他非常了解这一点，也回报了我的好意，这是我之后才知道的。","I kept an eye on Orlick after that night, and, whenever circumstances were favorable to his dancing at Biddy, got before him, to obscure that demonstration.He had struck root in Joe’s establishment, by reason of my sister’s sudden fancy for him, or I should have tried to get him dismissed.He quite understood and reciprocated my good intentions, as I had reason to know thereafter."
"而眼下，由于我之前的心绪还不够杂乱，我又让它复杂了五十倍。在有些时候和状态之下，我清楚地知道，比迪远比埃斯特拉要好，我生来就注定要过的这种平淡、诚实的铁匠生活没有什么让人羞愧的，这种生活让我有足够的理由感到自豪与幸福。在这种时候，我总是最终决定我对亲爱的老兄乔以及铁匠铺的不满都消失了，我会自然地成长为乔的合伙人，并且陪伴着比迪——突然之间，一些关于在郝维仙小姐家时的混乱记忆涌上我的心头，就像极具破坏性的飞弹一样，把我的理智弄得粉碎。粉碎的理智要花费很长的时间才能恢复，而常常在我把它们重新整理到一起之前，一走神一个念头又将其朝四面八方驱散开来。这个念头就是，也许最后在我出徒之后，郝维仙小姐会让我大有前途。","And now, because my mind was not confused enough before, I complicated its confusion fifty thousand-fold, by having states and seasons when I was clear that Biddy was immeasurably better than Estella, and that the plain honest working life to which I was born, had nothing in it to be ashamed of, but offered me sufficient means of self-respect and happiness.At those times, I would decide conclusively that my disaffection to dear old Joe and the forge, was gone, and that I was growing up in a fair way to be partners with Joe and to keep company with Biddy—when all in a moment some confounding remembrance of the Havisham days would fall upon me, like a destructive missile, and scatter my wits again.Scattered wits take a long time picking up; and often, before I had got them well together, they would be dispersed in all directions by one stray thought, that perhaps after all Miss Havisham was going to make my fortune when my time was out."
"我敢说，即使我已经学成出徒了，我仍然会深陷在极度困惑的状态之中。但是学徒期从来没有期满结束，而是像之前我提到的那样被提前中止了。","If my time had run out, it would have left me still at the height of my perplexities, I dare say.It never did run out, however, but was brought to a premature end, as I proceed to relate."
"第十八章","Chapter 18"
"那是我成为乔的学徒之后的第四年，在一个星期六的晚上。一群人聚集在“三个快活船员”酒馆里，他们围坐在火炉旁边，聚精会神地听沃甫赛先生大声地读报纸。我是这一群人当中的一个。","It was in the fourth year of my apprenticeship to Joe, and it was a Saturday night.There was a group assembled round the fire at the Three Jolly Bargemen, attentive to Mr. Wopsle as he read the newspaper aloud.Of that group I was one."
"新闻报道了一起非常轰动的谋杀案，沃甫赛先生读的时候似乎满脸都沾了鲜血。他幸灾乐祸地读着案件描述当中的每一个令人憎恶的形容词，而且把自己当成审理过程中的每一个证人。他会装作受害者，虚弱地呻吟道：“我完了。”他也会扮成谋杀犯，残暴地吼道：“我会找你报仇的。”他刻意模仿我们当地的医生，给出了医学上的证词。他扮成一个上了年纪的公路收费员，这个收费员听到了凶杀案的击打声。他尖叫和颤抖得非常厉害，几乎到了瘫痪的程度，让人怀疑这个证人的精神是否正常。经过沃甫赛先生的演绎，验尸官成了雅典的泰门，差役变成了科里奥兰勒斯。他完全沉浸其中，我们都听得津津有味、无比惬意。我们怀着自在、惬意的心情听取了判决——蓄意谋杀。","A highly popular murder had been committed, and Mr. Wopsle was imbrued in blood to the eyebrows.He gloated over every abhorrent adjective in the description, and identified himself with every witness at the Inquest.He faintly moaned, “I am done for,” as the victim, and he barbarously bellowed, “I’ll serve you out,” as the murderer.He gave the medical testimony, in pointed imitation of our local practitioner; and he piped and shook, as the aged turnpike-keeper who had heard blows, to an extent so very paralytic as to suggest a doubt regarding the mental competency of that witness.The coroner, in Mr. Wopsle’s hands, became Timon of Athens; the beadle, Coriolanus.He enjoyed himself thoroughly, and we all enjoyed ourselves, and were delightfully comfortable.In this cozy state of mind we came to the verdict Willful Murder."
"就在这时，我才注意到一个陌生的绅士斜靠在我对面那张长椅的后面，看着这一切。他脸上带着一副鄙视的神情，一面咬着他粗大食指的一边，一面观察着这群人的面孔，","Then, and not sooner, I became aware of a strange gentleman leaning over the back of the settle opposite me, looking on.There was an expression of contempt on his face, and he bit the side of a great forefinger as he watched the group of faces."
"“好啦！”当沃甫赛先生读完了之后，这个陌生人对他说，“我相信，你已经心满意足地处理好这个案子了吧？”","“Well!” said the stranger to Mr. Wopsle, when the reading was done, “you have settled it all to your own satisfaction, I have no doubt?”"
"所有人都大吃一惊地抬起了头，仿佛他就是凶手一样。他冷冷地、讥讽地看着所有人。","Everybody started and looked up, as if it were the murderer.He looked at everybody coldly and sarcastically."
"“有罪，是吗？”他说，“说出来吧。说啊！”","“Guilty, of course?” said he. “Out with it. Come!”"
"“先生，”沃甫赛先生回答说，“虽然我没能有幸认识您，但我确实认为罪名成立。”听到这句话，我们都鼓起勇气，一致地小声应和着。","“Sir,” returned Mr. Wopsle, “without having the honor of your acquaintance, I do say Guilty.”Upon this, we all took courage to unite in a confirmatory murmur."
"“我知道你认为他有罪。”这个陌生人说道，“我早就知道你会这么认为。我早就跟你说过了。不过现在我要问你一个问题。你到底知不知道，英国法律认为每一个人都是无辜的，除非他被证明——证明——有罪？”","“I know you do,” said the stranger; “I knew you would.I told you so.But now I’ll ask you a question.Do you know, or do you not know, that the law of England supposes every man to be innocent, until he is proved—proved—to be guilty?”"
"“先生，”沃甫赛先生开始回答，“身为一个英国人，我——”","“Sir,” Mr. Wopsle began to reply, “as an Englishman myself, I—”"
"“行啦！”这个陌生人一边朝他咬着自己的食指，一边说，“别回避问题。要么知道，要么不知道。到底知不知道？”","“Come!” said the stranger, biting his forefinger at him.“Don’t evade the question.Either you know it, or you don’t know it.Which is it to be?”"
"他站在那里，把头偏向一边，身体偏向另一边，一副威胁审问的架势。他用食指指向沃甫赛先生——就像指认他一样——之后又开始咬他的食指。","He stood with his head on one side and himself on one side, in a bullying interrogative manner, and he threw his forefinger at Mr. Wopsle—as it were to mark him out—before biting it again."
"“快说！”他说道，“你知道还是不知道？”","“Now!” said he.“Do you know it, or don’t you know it?”"
"“我当然知道。”沃甫赛先生回答说。","“Certainly I know it,” replied Mr. Wopsle."
"“你当然知道。那为什么一开始你不这么说？现在，我再问你一个问题。”他抓着沃甫赛先生不放，仿佛他有权力这么对他似的。“你知不知道，还没有一个证人在法庭上被盘问过？”","“Certainly you know it.Then why didn’t you say so at first?Now, I’ll ask you another question;” taking possession of Mr. Wopsle, as if he had a right to him.“Do you know that none of these witnesses have yet been cross-examined?”"
"沃甫赛先生刚一开口：“我只能说——”这个陌生人就打断了他，","Mr. Wopsle was beginning, “I can only say—” when the stranger stopped him."
"“什么？你没有回答我的问题，是还是不是？”现在，我再问你一遍。”他又用手指指着他，“听清楚我的话。你是知道还是不知道，这些证人中还没有一个人在法庭上被盘问过？　快点，我只要你说一个词。是，还是不是？”","“What?You won’t answer the question, yes or no?Now, I’ll try you again.”Throwing his finger at him again.“Attend to me.Are you aware, or are you not aware, that none of these witnesses have yet been cross-examined?Come, I only want one word from you.Yes, or no?”"
"沃甫赛先生犹豫了，我们都开始对他有意见了。","Mr. Wopsle hesitated, and we all began to conceive rather a poor opinion of him."
"“快说！”这个陌生人说，“我会帮你的。你不值得帮，但我会帮你的。看着你手里拿的报纸。这是什么？”","“Come!” said the stranger, “I’ll help you.You don’t deserve help, but I’ll help you.Look at that paper you hold in your hand.What is it?”"
"“这是什么？”沃甫赛先生看着它重复道，他非常迷惑。","“What is it?” repeated Mr. Wopsle, eyeing it, much at a loss."
"“这是不是，”这个陌生人用最讥讽、最不信任的口吻继续说道，“你刚刚读的那一版印制的报纸？”","“Is it,” pursued the stranger in his most sarcastic and suspicious manner, “the printed paper you have just been reading from?”"
"“毫无疑问。”","“Undoubtedly.”"
"“毫无疑问。现在，看着这张报纸，告诉我是不是报纸上清清楚楚地写着，犯人明确表示他所有的法律顾问都让他保留辩护权？”","“Undoubtedly.Now, turn to that paper, and tell me whether it distinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that his legal advisers instructed him altogether to reserve his defense?”"
"“我刚刚读到这一点了。”沃甫赛先生辩解道。","“I read that just now,” Mr. Wopsle pleaded."
"“别管你刚刚读到了什么，先生，我没问你刚刚读到了什么。你可以倒着读主持文，要是你喜欢的话——而且，也许在今天之前你已经这么干了。看着这张报纸。不，不，不，我的朋友，不是专栏的开头，你应该知道的，看下面，看下面。”（我们都开始觉得沃甫赛先生诡计多端。）“怎么样？你找到了吗？”","“Never mind what you read just now, sir; I don’t ask you what you read just now.You may read the Lord’s Prayer backwards, if you like—and, perhaps, have done it before to-day.Turn to the paper.No, no, no my friend; not to the top of the column; you know better than that; to the bottom, to the bottom.”(We all began to think Mr. Wopsle full of subterfuge.) “Well?Have you found it?”"
"“找到了。”沃甫赛先生说。","“Here it is,” said Mr. Wopsle."
"“现在，逐行往下看这一段，然后告诉我，文章是否清清楚楚地写着，罪犯明确表示他所有的法律顾问都让他保留辩护权？快啊！你领会到这层意思了吗？”","“Now, follow that passage with your eye, and tell me whether it distinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that he was instructed by his legal advisers wholly to reserve his defense?Come!Do you make that of it?”"
"沃甫赛先生回答说：“原话不是这么说的。”","Mr. Wopsle answered, “Those are not the exact words.”"
"“措词不一样！”这个绅士愤怒地重复道，“意思是一样的吗？”","“Not the exact words!” repeated the gentleman, bitterly.“Is that the exact substance?”"
"“是的。”沃甫赛先生说。","“Yes,” said Mr. Wopsle."
"“是的。”这个陌生人重复道，同时环视着余下的人，右手指着证人沃甫赛先生，“现在我问你，一个人眼前摆着这段文章，却仍然宣布自己没有经过审判的同胞有罪，事后还能睡得安安稳稳的，你对这个人的良心怎么看？”","“Yes,” repeated the stranger, looking round at the rest of the company with his right hand extended towards the witness, Wopsle.“And now I ask you what you say to the conscience of that man who, with that passage before his eyes, can lay his head upon his pillow after having pronounced a fellow-creature guilty, unheard?”"
"我们都开始怀疑沃甫赛先生并不是我们之前认为的那种人，而且他马上就要原形毕露了。","We all began to suspect that Mr. Wopsle was not the man we had thought him, and that he was beginning to be found out."
"“而且，不要忘了，就是这个人，”这个绅士将手指用力地指向沃甫赛先生并继续说道，“就是这个人可能被召去做陪审员来审理这个案件，而他就这样犯了这样大的罪恶，然后回到家里，安安稳稳地睡大觉。而在此之前，他还从容地宣誓，说他会公正地审理这起事关我们高贵的国王陛下和在押犯人的案子，会根据证据作出公平的判决，求上帝保佑他吧！”","“And that same man, remember,” pursued the gentleman, throwing his finger at Mr. Wopsle heavily; “that same man might be summoned as a juryman upon this very trial, and, having thus deeply committed himself, might return to the bosom of his family and lay his head upon his pillow, after deliberately swearing that he would well and truly try the issue joined between Our Sovereign Lord the King and the prisoner at the bar, and would a true verdict give according to the evidence, so help him God!”"
"我们都深信不幸的沃甫赛先生做得太过分了，他最好趁现在还有时间，赶快停止这种鲁莽的行为。","We were all deeply persuaded that the unfortunate Wopsle had gone too far, and had better stop in his reckless career while there was yet time."
"这个陌生的绅士透出一种不容置疑的权威气势，他的样子看起来就像知道我们所有人的秘密，如果他揭露出来，我们每一个人都会完蛋那样。他从长椅的后面走出来，走到火炉前面两张长椅的中间。他站在那里，左手插在口袋里，嘴里咬着右手食指。","The strange gentleman, with an air of authority not to be disputed, and with a manner expressive of knowing something secret about every one of us that would effectually do for each individual if he chose to disclose it, left the back of the settle, and came into the space between the two settles, in front of the fire, where he remained standing: his left hand in his pocket, and he biting the forefinger of his right."
"“根据我得到的信息，”我们都胆怯地蜷缩在他面前，他环视着我们说道，“我有理由相信，你们当中有一个铁匠，名字叫约瑟夫——或者是乔——格雷戈里。哪一个是他？”","“From information I have received,” said he, looking round at us as we all quailed before him, “I have reason to believe there is a blacksmith among you, by name Joseph—or Joe—Gargery.Which is the man?”"
"“我就是。”乔说道。","“Here is the man,” said Joe."
"这个陌生的绅士招手示意乔出来，于是乔走了过去。","The strange gentleman beckoned him out of his place, and Joe went."
"“你有个学徒，”陌生人继续说道，“大家都叫他皮普？他在这里吗？”","“You have an apprentice,” pursued the stranger, “commonly known as Pip?Is he here?”"
"“我在！”我喊道。","“I am here!” I cried. "
"这个陌生人没有认出我来，但我认出了他，他就是我第二次去拜访郝维仙小姐时在楼梯上见到的那位绅士。我见他从长椅那边看过来的那一刻就认出了他。现在我站在他面前，他的手搭在我的肩膀上。我又核实了他的细节——他的大头、黝黑的肤色、深陷下去的眼睛、浓密乌黑的眉毛、粗大的表链、又硬又黑的胡须，甚至还有他那双大手上散发出来的肥皂香气。","The stranger did not recognize me, but I recognized him as the gentleman I had met on the stairs, on the occasion of my second visit to Miss Havisham.I had known him the moment I saw him looking over the settle, and now that I stood confronting him with his hand upon my shoulder, I checked off again in detail, his large head, his dark complexion, his deep-set eyes, his bushy black eyebrows, his large watch-chain, his strong black dots of beard and whisker, and even the smell of scented soap on his great hand."
"“我希望能和你们两个私下谈谈。”他从容地审视了我一番后说道，“时间会有点长。也许我们最好去你们家吧。我不想现在就透露我要讲的内容，以后你们可以告诉你们的朋友，或多或少由你们自己决定，那就和我没有关系了。”","“I wish to have a private conference with you two,” said he, when he had surveyed me at his leisure.“It will take a little time.Perhaps we had better go to your place of residence.I prefer not to anticipate my communication here; you will impart as much or as little of it as you please to your friends afterwards; I have nothing to do with that.”"
"在一片疑惑的沉默当中，我们三个人走出了“三个快活船员”酒馆，带着疑惑，沉默地走回了家。一路上，这个陌生的绅士不时地看看我，不时地咬几下他的手指边。当我们靠近家门的时候，乔隐约意识到，这是一个非同一般的庄重场合，于是快走几步，上前把大门打开。我们的谈话在大客厅里进行，那里只有一根蜡烛，光线微弱。","Amidst a wondering silence, we three walked out of the Jolly Bargemen, and in a wondering silence walked home.While going along, the strange gentleman occasionally looked at me, and occasionally bit the side of his finger.As we neared home, Joe vaguely acknowledging the occasion as an impressive and ceremonious one, went on ahead to open the front door.Our conference was held in the state parlor, which was feebly lighted by one candle."
"首先，这个陌生的绅士在桌旁坐下来，把蜡烛移向自己这边，浏览了一下他笔记本上的一些事项。在借着烛光盯着黑暗中的乔和我，努力辨清谁是谁之后，他收起笔记本，把蜡烛移开了一点点。","It began with the strange gentleman’s sitting down at the table, drawing the candle to him, and looking over some entries in his pocket-book.He then put up the pocket-book and set the candle a little aside: after peering round it into the darkness at Joe and me, to ascertain which was which."
"“我的名字，”他说，“叫贾格尔斯，我是伦敦的一名律师。我很有名气。我有特别的事情要和你们处理，在最开始我要解释的是，这并不是我的本意。要是有人征求我的意见的话，我现在就不会在这里了。但是没人问我的意见，所以你们现在就在这里看到我了。我是作为另一个人的秘密代理人来这里的。情况就是这样。”","“My name,” he said, “is Jaggers, and I am a lawyer in London.I am pretty well known.I have unusual business to transact with you, and I commence by explaining that it is not of my originating.If my advice had been asked, I should not have been here.It was not asked, and you see me here.What I have to do as the confidential agent of another, I do.No less, no more.”"
"他发现，从他现在坐的地方不能清楚地看到我们俩，所以他站起来，一条腿跨过椅背，身体斜靠在椅子上，于是现在就是一只脚踩在椅座上，另一只脚踩在地板上。","Finding that he could not see us very well from where he sat, he got up, and threw one leg over the back of a chair and leaned upon it; thus having one foot on the seat of the chair, and one foot on the ground."
"“是这样的，约瑟夫·格雷戈里，我受人委托来解除你和你这个年轻学徒之间的师徒关系。在他的请求之下，同时也是为了他好，你不会反对解除他的师徒契约吧？你不会有什么条件吧？”","“Now, Joseph Gargery, I am the bearer of an offer to relieve you of this young fellow your apprentice.You would not object to cancel his indentures, at his request and for his good?You would want nothing for so doing?”"
"“上帝是不允许我开出任何条件来阻碍皮普的前程的。”乔瞪大眼睛说道。","“Lord forbid that I should want anything for not standing in Pip’s way,” said Joe, staring."
"“上帝不允许说明你很虔诚，但这不是问题的答案。”贾格尔斯先生回答说，“问题是，你有没有什么条件？你想开出什么条件吗？”","“Lord forbidding is pious, but not to the purpose,” returned Mr Jaggers.“The question is, Would you want anything?Do you want anything?”"
"“答案是，”乔板着脸说，“没有。”","“The answer is,” returned Joe, sternly, “No.”"
"我觉得贾格尔斯先生瞥了乔一眼，仿佛他认为乔这么无私，肯定是个大傻瓜。但我并不确定，因为由于好奇与惊讶，我已经呼吸急促、困惑不解了。","I thought Mr. Jaggers glanced at Joe, as if he considered him a fool for his disinterestedness.But I was too much bewildered between breathless curiosity and surprise, to be sure of it."
"“很好。”贾格尔斯先生说，“记住你刚刚做出的应允，一会儿不要想着改主意。”","“Very well,” said Mr. Jaggers.“Recollect the admission you have made, and don’t try to go from it presently.”"
"“谁一会儿想要改主意？”乔反驳道。","“Who’s a-going to try?” retorted Joe."
"“我没说任何人。你养狗了吗？”","“I don’t say anybody is.Do you keep a dog?”"
"“对，我是养了一只狗。”","“Yes, I do keep a dog.”"
"“记住，自夸就像一条好狗，但牢靠才是狗中极品。记住这句话，行吗？”贾格尔斯先生一边重复道，一边闭上眼睛对乔点着头，仿佛他正对乔做得某些事情表示原谅。“好了，我回到正题，说说这个年轻人吧。我想说的是，他有着远大的前程。”","“Bear in mind then, that Brag is a good dog, but Holdfast is a better.Bear that in mind, will you?” repeated Mr. Jaggers, shutting his eyes and nodding his head at Joe, as if he were forgiving him something.“Now, I return to this young fellow.And the communication I have got to make is, that he has great expectations.”"
"我和乔大喘了几口气，面面相觑。","Joe and I gasped, and looked at one another."
"“我受托来通知他，”贾格尔斯先生用手指斜指着我说道，“他将会继承一大笔财产。而且，这笔财产现在的所有人希望他能马上离开他目前的生活环境和居所，成长为一个上流社会的绅士——简而言之，就是一个前程远大的年轻人。”","“I am instructed to communicate to him,” said Mr. Jaggers, throwing his finger at me sideways, “that he will come into a handsome property.Further, that it is the desire of the present possessor of that property, that he be immediately removed from his present sphere of life and from this place, and be brought up as a gentleman—in a word, as a young fellow of great expectations.”"
"我的梦想实现了，我最荒唐的幻想成为了实实在在的现实，郝维仙小姐将彻底改变我的命运。","My dream was out; my wild fancy was surpassed by sober reality; Miss Havisham was going to make my fortune on a grand scale."
"“现在，皮普先生，”这位律师接着说，“以下我必须说的话都是针对你的。你要明白，首先，委托我的人要求你要一直使用皮普这个名字。我敢说，对于继承这么一大笔财产来说，你是不会反对这样一个简单的条件的。但是如果你有任何反对意见，现在可以提出来。”","“Now, Mr. Pip,” pursued the lawyer, “I address the rest of what I have to say, to you.You are to understand, first, that it is the request of the person from whom I take my instructions, that you always bear the name of Pip.You will have no objection, I dare say, to your great expectations being encumbered with that easy condition.But if you have any objection, this is the time to mention it.”"
"我心跳得飞快，耳朵里嗡嗡作响，我好不容易才结结巴巴地说了句“不反对”。","My heart was beating so fast, and there was such a singing in my ears, that I could scarcely stammer I had no objection."
"“我就知道你不反对！现在，你要知道的是，第二，皮普先生，你这位慷慨恩主的名字要严格保密，直到这个人决定公开为止。我有权告诉你的是，这个人打算在合适的时候亲口告诉你。至于什么时候、在哪里告诉你，这个我也说不准，没有人说得准。可能是很多年以后。现在，你要明确地知道，在你和我的所有交谈当中，严格禁止你问及此人，或者在任何程度上暗示或影射此人可能是某某人。如果你心里有某种猜疑，就把那个猜疑埋在你自己心里吧。这一禁令的理由并非毫无道理，理由可能是最充分、最严肃的，也可能仅仅是一时兴起而生出的念头。这不是你应该问的。条件已经摆出来了。你要接受并遵守这些条件，这就是我受委托人的指示，对你提出的最后一个条件，除此之外，我对委托人不负有任何责任。你所得到的遗产就是来自这个人，而秘密只有这个人和我知道。同样的，对于继承这么一大笔财富来说，这并不是一个很苛刻的条件。但是如果你对此有任何反对意见，现在可以提出来。说吧。”","“I should think not!Now you are to understand, secondly, Mr. Pip, that the name of the person who is your liberal benefactor remains a profound secret, until the person chooses to reveal it.I am empowered to mention that it is the intention of the person to reveal it at first hand by word of mouth to yourself.When or where that intention may be carried out, I cannot say; no one can say.It may be years hence.Now, you are distinctly to understand that you are most positively prohibited from making any inquiry on this head, or any allusion or reference, however distant, to any individual whomsoever as the individual, in all the communications you may have with me.If you have a suspicion in your own breast, keep that suspicion in your own breast.It is not the least to the purpose what the reasons of this prohibition are; they may be the strongest and gravest reasons, or they may be mere whim.This is not for you to inquire into.The condition is laid down.Your acceptance of it, and your observance of it as binding, is the only remaining condition that I am charged with, by the person from whom I take my instructions, and for whom I am not otherwise responsible.That person is the person from whom you derive your expectations, and the secret is solely held by that person and by me.Again, not a very difficult condition with which to encumber such a rise in fortune; but if you have any objection to it, this is the time to mention it.Speak out.”"
"我再一次费力结巴地说了一句“我没有反对意见”。","Once more, I stammered with difficulty that I had no objection."
"“我就知道没有！好了，皮普先生，我已经把规定都说完了。”尽管他叫我皮普先生，并开始奉承我，但他仍然面带某种威胁、猜疑的神情。甚至到现在为止，他还在说话的时候不时地闭上眼睛，用手指猛地指向我，那架势就好像在表明，他知道我所有的秘密，只要他想泄露出去，我就会颜面扫地。“我们接下来就只谈谈安排的具体细节。你必须明白的是，尽管我多次使用‘遗产’这个词，但是你继承的将不仅仅是遗产。有一笔钱已经寄放在我手里了，这笔钱足够让你享受到良好的教育以及丰裕的生活。请你把我看作你的监护人。噢！”我正要感谢他，他又说道，“同时我要告诉你，我是向他收取服务费的，否则我是不会提供服务的。我们认为，根据你身份地位的改变，你必须受到更好的教育，而且你必须意识到马上抓住这一有利条件的重要性和必要性。”","“I should think not!Now, Mr. Pip, I have done with stipulations.”Though he called me Mr. Pip, and began rather to make up to me, he still could not get rid of a certain air of bullying suspicion; and even now he occasionally shut his eyes and threw his finger at me while he spoke, as much as to express that he knew all kinds of things to my disparagement, if he only chose to mention them.“We come next, to mere details of arrangement.You must know that, although I have used the term “expectations” more than once, you are not endowed with expectations only.There is already lodged in my hands, a sum of money amply sufficient for your suitable education and maintenance.You will please consider me your guardian.Oh!” for I was going to thank him, “I tell you at once, I am paid for my services, or I shouldn’t render them.It is considered that you must be better educated, in accordance with your altered position, and that you will be alive to the importance and necessity of at once entering on that advantage.”"
"我说我一直以来都渴望有这样的机会。","I said I had always longed for it."
"“不用管你之前一直都渴望什么，皮普先生，”他反驳道，“都留在过去吧。只要你现在渴望这个机会，那就足够了。我想你已经准备好马上接受一位合适导师的教育了，是吗？是不是？”","“Never mind what you have always longed for, Mr. Pip,” he retorted; “keep to the record.If you long for it now, that’s enough.Am I answered that you are ready to be placed at once, under some proper tutor?Is that it?”"
"我结结巴巴地说了句‘是，是的’。","I stammered yes, that was it."
"“那就好。现在我想听听你的意见。我觉得这是不明智的，你得清楚这一点，但是这是我的责任。你有没有听说哪位让你比较喜欢的导师？”","“Good.Now, your inclinations are to be consulted.I don’t think that wise, mind, but it’s my trust.Have you ever heard of any tutor whom you would prefer to another?”"
"除了比迪和沃甫赛先生的姑婆之外，我没有听说过任何导师，所以我回答说没有。　","I had never heard of any tutor but Biddy and Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt; so, I replied in the negative."
"“我知道一位导师，我觉得他可能适合这项工作。”贾格尔斯先生说，“但你要知道，我并不是推荐他，因为我从不推荐任何人。我说的这位绅士是马修·鄱凯特先生。”","“There is a certain tutor, of whom I have some knowledge, who I think might suit the purpose,” said Mr. Jaggers.“I don’t recommend him, observe; because I never recommend anybody.The gentleman I speak of, is one Mr. Matthew Pocket.”"
"啊！我立刻就知道这个人是谁了。他是郝维仙小姐的亲戚。卡米拉先生和卡米拉夫人之前说起过这个马修。当郝维仙小姐去世后身穿新娘礼服躺在新娘的桌子上时，正是这个马修要站在她的头那边。","Ah! I caught at the name directly.Miss Havisham’s relation.The Matthew whom Mr. and Mrs. Camilla had spoken of.The Matthew whose place was to be at Miss Havisham’s head, when she lay dead, in her bride’s dress on the bride’s table."
"“你认识这个人？”贾格尔斯先生敏锐地看着我说道，然后闭上眼睛等我回答。","“You know the name?” said Mr. Jaggers, looking shrewdly at me, and then shutting up his eyes while he waited for my answer."
"我回答说我之前听说过这个名字。","My answer was, that I had heard of the name."
"“哦！”他说，“你已经听说过这个名字了。但问题是，你觉得怎么样？”","“Oh！”said he.“You have heard of the name.But the question is, what do you say of it?”"
"我说了一句，或者想说，我非常感谢他的推荐——","I said, or tried to say, that I was much obliged to him for his recommendation—"
"“不，我年轻的朋友！”他慢慢地晃动着他的大脑袋，插了一句，“你自己要好好想想！”","“No, my young friend!” he interrupted, shaking his great head very slowly.“Recollect yourself!”"
"我没怎么想，就又开始说，我非常感谢他的推荐——","Not recollecting myself, I began again that I was much obliged to him for his recommendation—"
"“不，我年轻的朋友，”他晃着脑袋，一边皱眉一边微笑地插了进来，“不，不，不，这句话说得很好，但用在这里是不行的，你还太年轻，轮不到你拿它来纠正我。不能用‘推荐’这个词，皮普先生。换个别的词。”","“No, my young friend,” he interrupted, shaking his head and frowning and smiling both at once; “no, no, no; it’s very well done, but it won’t do; you are too young to fix me with it.Recommendation is not the word, Mr. Pip.Try another.”"
"我改正了自己的说法，我说非常感谢他提到马修·鄱凯特先生——","Correcting myself, I said that I was much obliged to him for his mention of Mr. Matthew Pocket—"
"“这就好多了！”贾格尔斯先生喊道。","“That’s more like it!” cried Mr. Jaggers."
"——而且（我补充说），我很乐意试试这位绅士。","—And (I added), I would gladly try that gentleman."
"“很好。你最好去他家里试试他。路线会替你准备好的，你可以先见见他的儿子，他儿子在伦敦。你什么时候来伦敦？”","“Good.You had better try him in his own house.The way shall be prepared for you, and you can see his son first, who is in London.When will you come to London?”"
"我说（同时瞥了乔一眼，他一动也不动地站在那里看着这一切），我想我很快就可以动身。","I said (glancing at Joe, who stood looking on, motionless), that I supposed I could come directly."
"“首先，”贾格尔斯先生说，“你得弄几件新衣服，这新衣服可不能是工作服。就定在下星期的今天吧。你会需用钱的。我给你留下二十个几尼怎么样？”","“First,” said Mr. Jaggers, “you should have some new clothes to come in, and they should not be working clothes.Say this day week.You’ll want some money.Shall I leave you twenty guineas?”"
"他极其冷静地拿出一个长长的钱袋子，在桌子上数好之后，把二十个几尼推到我面前。这是他第一次把腿从椅子上放下来。他把钱推过来之后就跨坐在椅子上，一边晃着他的钱袋子，一边看着乔。","He produced a long purse, with the greatest coolness, and counted them out on the table and pushed them over to me.This was the first time he had taken his leg from the chair.He sat astride of the chair when he had pushed the money over, and sat swinging his purse and eyeing Joe."
"“怎么了，约瑟夫·格雷戈里？你看起来被惊呆了？”","“Well, Joseph Gargery?You look dumb-foundered?”"
"“是啊！”乔用十分坚定的口气说道。","“I am!” said Joe, in a very decided manner."
"“你之前已经表示过，自己什么都不想要，记得吗？”","“It was understood that you wanted nothing for yourself, remember?”"
"“我之前是这个意思。”乔说，“现在也是这个意思。而且永远都会是这个意思。”","“It were understood,” said Joe.“And it are understood.And it ever will be similar according.”"
"“但是如果，”贾格尔斯先生晃着他的钱袋子说，“如果我受委托要送你一点礼物作为补偿呢？”","“But what,” said Mr. Jaggers, swinging his purse, “what if it was in my instructions to make you a present, as compensation?”"
"“补偿什么？”乔问道。","“As compensation what for?” Joe demanded."
"“补偿你无法再让他为你工作的损失。”","“For the loss of his services.”"
"乔像女人那样把手放在我的肩膀上。在那之后，我常常觉得，他就像一把汽锤子，刚柔并济，既能摧毁一个人又能轻轻拍碎蛋壳。乔说：“皮普能够摆脱这里的工作，过上尊贵富裕的生活，我非常乐意，都不知道该怎样跟他说。但是如果你认为，用钱就能够补偿我失去这个小孩子——相对铁匠铺里的工作而言，他还是个小孩子——也是我永远最好的朋友的话，那你就错啦！”","Joe laid his hand upon my shoulder with the touch of a woman.I have often thought him since, like the steam-hammer, that can crush a man or pat an egg-shell, in his combination of strength with gentleness.“Pip is that hearty welcome,” said Joe, “to go free with his services, to honor and fortun’, as no words can tell him.But if you think as Money can make compensation to me for the loss of the little child—what come to the forge—and ever the best of friends!—”"
"噢，亲爱的、善良的乔，我当时那么急着要离开你，那么忘恩负义地对你，如今我仿佛又看到了你，看到你用铁匠那结实的手臂擦拭你的泪眼，看到你宽大的胸脯上下起伏，听到你的声音渐渐消失。噢，亲爱的、善良的乔，忠实的、温柔的乔，我仍然感觉得到你的手在我的臂膀上满是爱怜地颤抖，如今它就像天使羽翼那样庄重严肃地抖动。","O dear good Joe, whom I was so ready to leave and so unthankful to, I see you again, with your muscular blacksmith’s arm before your eyes, and your broad chest heaving, and your voice dying away.O dear good faithful tender Joe, I feel the loving tremble of your hand upon my arm, as solemnly this day as if it had been the rustle of an angel’s wing!"
"然而，那时候我还鼓动乔。我迷失在我未来财富的迷宫之中，无法找到我们曾经一起走过的小路。我请求乔不要难过，因为（就像他所说的那样）我们一直以来都是最好的朋友，而且（就像我所说的那样）我们永远都会是最好的朋友。乔用另一只手的手腕使劲地擦了擦眼睛，就好像要把自己眼珠子挖出来一样，但没有再说一个字。","But I encouraged Joe at the time.I was lost in the mazes of my future fortunes, and could not retrace the by-paths we had trodden together.I begged Joe to be comforted, for (as he said) we had ever been the best of friends, and (as I said) we ever would be so.Joe scooped his eyes with his disengaged wrist, as if he were bent on gouging himself, but said not another word."
"贾格尔斯先生看着这一切，他认为乔是个愚蠢的乡巴佬，而我就是他被监护的人。结束的时候，他已经不再摇晃钱袋子了，而是用手掂量着说道：","Mr. Jaggers had looked on at this, as one who recognized in Joe the village idiot, and in me his keeper.When it was over, he said, weighing in his hand the purse he had ceased to swing:"
"“现在，约瑟夫·格雷戈里，我提醒你，这可是你最后的机会了。别跟我遮遮掩掩的。如果你想要得到这份我受委托交给你的礼物，你就说出来，这礼物就是你的了。如果相反，你想说——”这时，让他非常吃惊的是，乔突然像个要击倒对手的拳击手一样在他面前比划起来，打断了他的话。","“Now, Joseph Gargery, I warn you this is your last chance.No half measures with me.If you mean to take a present that I have it in charge to make you, speak out, and you shall have it.If on the contrary you mean to say—” Here, to his great amazement, he was stopped by Joe’s suddenly working round him with every demonstration of a fell pugilistic purpose."
"“我想说的是，”乔喊道，“要是你是来我家戏弄我、耍我的话，你就站出来啊！我要说的是，你要是个男子汉的话就来啊！我想说的是，我说话算话，要么打赢你，要么被你打趴下！”","“Which I meantersay,” cried Joe, “that if you come into my place bull-baiting and badgering me, come out!Which I meantersay as sech if you’re a man, come on!Which I meantersay that what I say, I meantersay and stand or fall by!”"
"我把乔拉到一边，他马上平静了下来，仅仅是非常主动地告诉我，也是礼貌地告诫所有可能的相关人士说，他决不会在自己家里被欺负、被戏弄。贾格尔斯先生已经在乔比划的时候站起身来，退到门口附近。他没有显示出任何想要再进来的意思，就站在那里发表了他的告别辞。内容是这样的：","I drew Joe away, and he immediately became placable; merely stating to me, in an obliging manner and as a polite expostulatory notice to any one whom it might happen to concern, that he were not a going to be bull-baited and badgered in his own place.Mr. Jaggers had risen when Joe demonstrated, and had backed near the door.Without evincing any inclination to come in again, he there delivered his valedictory remarks.They were these:"
"“好了，皮普先生，我觉得既然你就要成为上层社会的绅士了，你还是越早离开这里越好。时间就定在下星期的今天，到时候你会收到我印有地址的卡片。你可以在伦敦的驿站坐上一辆出租马车，直接来找我。你要明白，我对我接受的这份委托没有任何这样或那样的意见。别人花钱雇我，我就这么办事。好了，最终你要明白这一点。明白这一点！”","“Well, Mr. Pip, I think the sooner you leave here—as you are to be a gentleman—the better.Let it stand for this day week, and you shall receive my printed address in the meantime.You can take a hackney-coach at the stage-coach office in London, and come straight to me.Understand, that I express no opinion, one way or other, on the trust I undertake.I am paid for undertaking it, and I do so.Now, understand that, finally.Understand that!”"
"他用手指指着我们两个，我想，要不是他觉得乔是个危险人物，他得赶快离开的话，他会继续说下去的。","He was throwing his finger at both of us, and I think would have gone on, but for his seeming to think Joe dangerous, and going off."
"他朝“三个快活船员”酒馆的方向去了，因为他把一辆租来的马车停在那里了。这时我突然想起一件事，于是在他后面追了过去。","Something came into my head which induced me to run after him, as he was going down to the Jolly Bargemen where he had left a hired carriage."
"“打扰一下，贾格尔斯先生。”","“I beg your pardon, Mr. Jaggers.”"
"“噢！”他转过头说，“怎么了？”","“Halloa!” said he, facing round, “what’s the matter?”"
"“我希望不会出现任何差错，贾格尔斯先生，一切都能按照您的指示去办，所以我觉得我最好问一下。我可不可以在离开之前跟我在这里认识的人告别呢？”","“I wish to be quite right, Mr. Jaggers, and to keep to your directions; so I thought I had better ask.Would there be any objection to my taking leave of any one I know, about here, before I go away?”"
"“可以。”他说道，样子看起来就像是不太明白我的意思。","“No,” said he, looking as if he hardly understood me."
"“我不仅仅是说村子里的熟人，如果是镇上的人呢？”","“I don’t mean in the village only, but up-town?”"
"“可以。”他说，“不反对。”","“No,” said he.“No objection.”"
"我谢过他之后又跑回了家。回到家里，我发现乔已经锁上了大门，走出了客厅，两手放在膝盖上，坐在厨房的火炉旁，两眼出神地盯着烧红的煤球。我也在火炉前坐了下来，看着煤球，久久没人开口说话。","I thanked him and ran home again, and there I found that Joe had already locked the front door and vacated the state parlor, and was seated by the kitchen fire with a hand on each knee, gazing intently at the burning coals.I too sat down before the fire and gazed at the coals, and nothing was said for a long time."
"我姐姐坐在她那张有靠垫的椅子上，被安置在火炉的一角。比迪坐在火炉前做针线活，乔坐在比迪旁边，我坐在乔旁边，并且正对着我姐姐。我越是看着火红的煤球，我就越是无法抬头看乔，沉默越久，我就越是说不出话来。","My sister was in her cushioned chair in her corner, and Biddy sat at her needlework before the fire, and Joe sat next Biddy, and I sat next Joe in the corner opposite my sister.The more I looked into the glowing coals, the more incapable I became of looking at Joe; the longer the silence lasted, the more unable I felt to speak."
"最后我开口了：“乔，你告诉比迪了吗？”","At length I got out, “Joe, have you told Biddy?”"
"“没有，皮普。”乔回答道，他仍然看着炉火，两手紧紧地抓住膝盖，仿佛他接到密报说这两只膝盖要逃跑了似的，“我想让你自己来说，皮普。”","“No, Pip,” returned Joe, still looking at the fire, and holding his knees tight, as if he had private information that they intended to make off somewhere, “which I left it to yourself, Pip.”"
"“我宁愿你来告诉她，乔。”","“I would rather you told, Joe.”"
"“皮普现在是个有钱的上流绅士了，”乔说道，“上帝保佑他吧！”","“Pip’s a gentleman of fortun’ then,” said Joe, “and God bless him in it!”"
"比迪放下针线活，看着我。乔抓着他的膝盖，看着我。我看着他们两个人。停顿了一会儿之后，他们两个衷心地祝贺我。但是他们的祝贺当中带着一些伤心，这让我很不喜欢。","Biddy dropped her work, and looked at me.Joe held his knees and looked at me.I looked at both of them.After a pause, they both heartily congratulated me; but there was a certain touch of sadness in their congratulations, that I rather resented."
"我主动告知比迪（也是通过比迪告知乔），我认为，作为我的朋友，他们要担负起重大的义务，不能打探也不能谈论我的恩主。我告诉他们，实情会在合适的时候揭晓，而在那之前，除了说我从一位神秘的恩主那里继承了一大笔财产之外，其他的什么都不要说。比迪对着炉火若有所思地点了点头，同时又拾起她的针线活。她说她会很谨慎的。乔仍然抓着膝盖说道：“哎，哎，我会特别谨慎的，皮普。”然后他们又祝贺了我，而且接着说我成了上流绅士，他们有多么惊讶，对此我一点也不喜欢听。","I took it upon myself to impress Biddy (and through Biddy, Joe) with the grave obligation I considered my friends under, to know nothing and say nothing about the maker of my fortune.It would all come out in good time, I observed, and in the meanwhile nothing was to be said, save that I had come into great expectations from a mysterious patron.Biddy nodded her head thoughtfully at the fire as she took up her work again, and said she would be very particular; and Joe, still detaining his knees, said, “Ay, ay, I’ll be ekervally partickler, Pip;” and then they congratulated me again, and went on to express so much wonder at the notion of my being a gentleman, that I didn’t half like it."
"之后，比迪费了很大的劲去跟我姐姐讲发生的事情。我十分坚定地相信，她的那些努力都白费了。她只是笑着，不停地点头，甚至还重复毕迪刚刚说过的话，“皮普”，“财产”。但我怀疑，这些词在她听来就跟竞选口号一样没什么意义。我觉得，她现在的心智水平已经糟糕得不能再糟糕了。","Infinite pains were then taken by Biddy to convey to my sister some idea of what had happened.To the best of my belief, those efforts entirely failed.She laughed and nodded her head a great many times, and even repeated after Biddy, the words “Pip” and “Property.”But I doubt if they had more meaning in them than an election cry, and I cannot suggest a darker picture of her state of mind."
"要不是亲身经历的话，我也不会相信的。但当乔和比迪又恢复了往日的轻松愉快时，我却非常低落。对我得到的财产不满意吗？当然不是。但很可能是我一直都对我自己不满意，我也不知道为什么。","I never could have believed it without experience, but as Joe and Biddy became more at their cheerful ease again, I became quite gloomy.Dissatisfied with my fortune, of course I could not be; but it is possible that I may have been, without quite knowing it, dissatisfied with myself."
"总之，当他们两个谈论着我的离去，谈论着没有我他们该怎么办等等的时候，我把胳膊肘放在膝盖上，用手托着头，凝视着炉火。不管什么时候，只要我发现他们两个有谁在看着我，尽管从来没有这么友好地看着我（而且他们不时地看看我，尤其是比迪），我就觉得被冒犯了：就像他们不信任我似的。不过上天知道，他们不管是在言语上还是行动上都从来没有这个意思。","Anyhow, I sat with my elbow on my knee and my face upon my hand, looking into the fire, as those two talked about my going away, and about what they should do without me, and all that.And whenever I caught one of them looking at me, though never so pleasantly (and they often looked at me—particularly Biddy), I felt offended: as if they were expressing some mistrust of me.Though Heaven knows they never did by word or sign."
"在那时，我就站起身来，在门口向外望去，因为我们厨房的门打开后就能看到夜景，门在夏日的晚上都是开着的，以便给室内通通风。当时我抬头仰望星空，那些星星在我看来却又可怜、又卑微，因为它们照耀着我一直以来生活其中的穷乡僻壤。","At those times I would get up and look out at the door; for, our kitchen door opened at once upon the night, and stood open on summer evenings to air the room.The very stars to which I then raised my eyes, I am afraid I took to be but poor and humble stars for glittering on the rustic objects among which I had passed my life."
"“星期六晚上，”当我们坐在奶酪面包和啤酒前开始吃晚饭的时候，我说道，“还有五天，然后就是动身的前一天了！这几天很快就过去了。”","“Saturday night,” said I, when we sat at our supper of bread-and-cheese and beer.“Five more days, and then the day before the day!They’ll soon go.”"
"“是的，皮普，”乔说道，他的声音在他嘴边的大啤酒杯里听起来很空洞，“这几天很快就过去了。”","“Yes, Pip,” observed Joe, whose voice sounded hollow in his beer mug.“They’ll soon go.”"
"“很快，很快就过去了。”比迪说。","“Soon, soon go,” said Biddy."
"“我一直在想，乔，周一我去镇上订做新衣服的时候，我是要告诉裁缝说我会去他店里直接穿上，还让他送到彭波契克先生家去。在这里会被所有人盯着看，那会让我很烦的。”","“I have been thinking, Joe, that when I go down town on Monday, and order my new clothes, I shall tell the tailor that I’ll come and put them on there, or that I’ll have them sent to Mr. Pumblechook’s.It would be very disagreeable to be stared at by all the people here.”"
"“哈布尔先生和哈布尔太太可能也想看看你穿上新的上流绅士的行头，皮普。”乔一边说着，一边起劲地切着他左手掌中涂了奶酪的面包，同时还看了看我没有动过的晚餐，仿佛他又想起了我们以前比赛谁吃得快的情景。“沃甫赛可能也这样想。而且，“三个快活船员”酒馆说不定会把这件事当成一种荣幸。”","“Mr. and Mrs. Hubble might like to see you in your new genteel figure too, Pip,” said Joe, industriously cutting his bread, with his cheese on it, in the palm of his left hand, and glancing at my untasted supper as if he thought of the time when we used to compare slices.“So might Wopsle.And the Jolly Bargemen might take it as a compliment.”"
"“那正是我不想要的，乔。他们一定会小题大做——把事情弄得粗俗、平庸——我可受不了。”","“That’s just what I don’t want, Joe.They would make such a business of it—such a coarse and common business—that I couldn’t bear myself.”"
"“哦，的确是这样，皮普！”乔说道，“要是你受不了的话——”","“Ah, that indeed, Pip!” said Joe.“If you couldn’t abear yourself—”"
"这时比迪正坐在那里拿着我姐姐的盘子，她问我：“你有没有想过什么时候穿来给格雷戈里先生、你姐姐还有我看看？你会穿来给我们看的，是不是？”","Biddy asked me here, as she sat holding my sister’s plate, “Have you thought about when you’ll show yourself to Mr. Gargery, and your sister, and me?You will show yourself to us; won’t you?”"
"“比迪，”我有点生气地回答说，“你也太快言快语了，我很难跟上你。”","“Biddy,” I returned with some resentment, “you are so exceedingly quick that it’s difficult to keep up with you.”"
"（“她总是快言快语。”乔说道。）","(“She always were quick,” observed Joe.)"
"“要是你刚刚耐心等一会儿，你就会听到我说我会在某天晚上把衣服包好拿到这里来——很可能是在我走之前的那个晚上。”","“If you had waited another moment, Biddy, you would have heard me say that I shall bring my clothes here in a bundle one evening—most likely on the evening before I go away.”"
"比迪没有再说话。我很大度地原谅了她，之后不久我就亲切地跟她还有乔道了晚安，然后上楼去睡觉。当我来到我的小屋，我坐下来好好地打量了一番这个房间。我不久就要离开这个简陋的小屋，进入上流社会，永远地离开这里，但这个小屋同样装满鲜活、生动的回忆。甚至就在那时，我又陷入了与之前相同的思想挣扎，挣扎在这个小屋和我即将住进去的大屋子之间，正如我过去常常挣扎在铁匠铺和郝维仙小姐家之间，挣扎在比迪和埃斯特拉小姐之间一样。","Biddy said no more.Handsomely forgiving her, I soon exchanged an affectionate good-night with her and Joe, and went up to bed.When I got into my little room, I sat down and took a long look at it, as a mean little room that I should soon be parted from and raised above, for ever, It was furnished with fresh young remembrances too, and even at the same moment I fell into much the same confused division of mind between it and the better rooms to which I was going, as I had been in so often between the forge and Miss Havisham’s, and Biddy and Estella."
"阳光一整天都明亮地照耀在我阁楼的屋顶上，小屋里很暖和。当我推开窗户，站在那里向外望去，我看到乔从下面黑黑的门洞里慢慢地走出来，在外面转了一两圈，然后我看见比迪走出来，给他拿来烟袋，帮他点上了。他从来不在这么晚的时候抽烟，在我看来，这似乎暗示着他由于某种原因需要安慰。","The sun had been shining brightly all day on the roof of my attic, and the room was warm.As I put the window open and stood looking out, I saw Joe come slowly forth at the dark door below, and take a turn or two in the air; and then I saw Biddy come, and bring him a pipe and light it for him.He never smoked so late, and it seemed to hint to me that he wanted comforting, for some reason or other."
"他现在就站在我正下方的门口，抽着烟袋。比迪也站在那里，轻轻地跟他说话。我知道他们在说我，因为我听见他们两个不止一次用怜爱的口吻提及我的名字。即使我能听见更多的谈话，我也不想再听了，所以我从窗边走开，在床边的一张椅子上坐下来。让我感到非常伤感和奇怪的是，在光明的命运降临的第一天晚上，我却感到前所未有的孤独。","He presently stood at the door immediately beneath me, smoking his pipe, and Biddy stood there too, quietly talking to him, and I knew that they talked of me, for I heard my name mentioned in an endearing tone by both of them more than once.I would not have listened for more, if I could have heard more: so, I drew away from the window, and sat down in my one chair by the bedside, feeling it very sorrowful and strange that this first night of my bright fortunes should be the loneliest I had ever known."
"我朝打开的窗户那边望去，看到从乔烟袋中升起的轻烟在那里飘浮着，我想到它就像乔对我的祝福——并不是强加给我，也不是在我面前炫耀，而是弥散在我们共同呼吸的空气当中。我熄灭蜡烛，爬上了床。这张床现在让我很不舒服，我在这里永远都无法像以前那样酣睡了。","Looking towards the open window, I saw light wreaths from Joe’s pipe floating there, and I fancied it was like a blessing from Joe—not obtruded on me or paraded before me, but pervading the air we shared together.I put my light out, and crept into bed; and it was an uneasy bed now, and I never slept the old sound sleep in it any more."
"第十九章","Chapter 19"
"第二天清晨的到来给我的人生前景带来相当大的改变，我的前途如此光明，跟以往截然不同。让我最担心的就是想到离我出发的那天还有六天，我不能不担忧。因为在这六天当中，伦敦那边说不定会发生变故，而等我赶到那里，所有美好的事情都大打折扣，甚至是化为乌有。","Morning made a considerable difference in my general prospect of Life, and brightened it so much that it scarcely seemed the same.What lay heaviest on my mind, was, the consideration that six days intervened between me and the day of departure; for, I could not divest myself of a misgiving that something might happen to London in the meanwhile, and that, when I got there, it would be either greatly deteriorated or clean gone."
"当我说起我们分别在即的时候，乔和比迪都非常支持并为我感到高兴，但是他们只是在我提到的时候才会谈及此事。早饭过后，乔从那间最好的客厅里的橱柜中取出我的师徒契约。我们把契约扔进了火堆，我感到自己重获自由。带着获得解放之后满心的新奇感，我和乔去了教堂。我想要是那个牧师知道了这一切的话，他也就不会读那些关于富人以及天国的故事了。","Joe and Biddy were very sympathetic and pleasant when I spoke of our approaching separation; but they only referred to it when I did.After breakfast, Joe brought out my indentures from the press in the best parlor, and we put them in the fire, and I felt that I was free.With all the novelty of my emancipation on me, I went to church with Joe, and thought, perhaps the clergyman wouldn’t have read that about the rich man and the kingdom of Heaven, if he had known all."
"早早地结束了晚饭之后，我独自出去散步。我想彻底与沼泽地做个了断，以后就再也不去那里了。当我经过教堂时，我对那些终其一生每个星期日都去教堂，而死后也只能默默无闻地躺在这低矮的青草堆中的可怜人表示极大的同情（我在早上做礼拜时就这么觉得）。我跟自己保证，有一天我会为他们做点事情，而且大体想好了一个计划，那就是为全村所有人举办一次盛宴，请他们吃烤牛肉、葡萄干布丁、每人一品脱麦酒，再加上一加仑的居尊俯就。","After our early dinner I strolled out alone, purposing to finish off the marshes at once, and get them done with.As I passed the church, I felt (as I had felt during service in the morning) a sublime compassion for the poor creatures who were destined to go there, Sunday after Sunday, all their lives through, and to lie obscurely at last among the low green mounds.I promised myself that I would do something for them one of these days, and formed a plan in outline for bestowing a dinner of roast-beef and plum-pudding, a pint of ale, and a gallon of condescension, upon everybody in the village."
"在此之前，每当我想到自己与我看到的那个一瘸一拐地走在墓地里的逃犯有来往时，我就觉得羞愧。而在今天这样一个星期日，这个地方又让我想起那个衣衫褴褛、浑身颤抖、戴着脚镣和罪犯标记的歹徒，我内心有何感受，可想而知！让我感到安慰的是，这已经是很久以前的事了，毫无疑问，他已经被押送到很远的地方了，对我来说他已经死了，而且说不定他真的死了。","If I had often thought before, with something allied to shame, of my companionship with the fugitive whom I had once seen limping among those graves, what were my thoughts on this Sunday, when the place recalled the wretch, ragged and shivering, with his felon iron and badge!My comfort was, that it happened a long time ago, and that he had doubtless been transported a long way off, and that he was dead to me, and might be veritably dead into the bargain."
"不会再看到低洼的湿地，不会再看到堤坝水闸，也不会再看到这些啃食牧草的牛群——不过这些闷不作声的牛现在看起来似乎恭敬多了，它们还转过头来面对着我，这样它们就能尽可能久地盯着我这个拥有一大笔财产的人——再见了，我儿时的这些单调而又熟悉的人，此后我就要奔赴伦敦，进入上流社会：不再以打铁为生，也不再与你们为伴！我一路欣喜地来到古炮台，躺在那里思索郝维仙小姐会不会把埃斯特拉嫁给我，想着想着就睡着了。","No more low wet grounds, no more dykes and sluices, no more of these grazing cattle—though they seemed, in their dull manner, to wear a more respectful air now, and to face round, in order that they might stare as long as possible at the possessor of such great expectations—farewell, monotonous acquaintances of my childhood, henceforth I was for London and greatness: not for smith’s work in general and for you!I made my exultant way to the old Battery, and, lying down there to consider the question whether Miss Havisham intended me for Estella, fell asleep."
"当我醒来时，我非常惊奇地发现，乔正坐在我旁边，抽着烟袋。见我睁开眼睛，乔很高兴地朝我笑了笑，然后说道：","When I awoke, I was much surprised to find Joe sitting beside me, smoking his pipe.He greeted me with a cheerful smile on my opening my eyes, and said:"
"“因为这是最后一次了，皮普，所以我觉得我要跟过来。”","“As being the last time, Pip, I thought I’d foller.”"
"“乔，我很高兴你跟过来了。”","“And Joe, I am very glad you did so.”"
"“谢谢你，皮普。”","“Thankee, Pip.”"
"“你可以肯定的是，亲爱的乔，”我们握过手之后我接着说道，“我永远都不会忘了你的。”","“You may be sure, dear Joe,” I went on, after we had shaken hands, “that I shall never forget you.”"
"“对啊，对啊，皮普！”乔用欣慰的口吻说，“我肯定你不会忘了我的。哎，哎，老弟！上帝保佑你啊，只需把心放宽就能做到这一点。不过我花了一点时间来让自己放宽心，因为这变化来得太突然了，不是吗？”","“No, no, Pip!” said Joe, in a comfortable tone, “I’m sure of that.Ay, ay, old chap!Bless you, it were only necessary to get it well round in a man’s mind, to be certain on it.But it took a bit of time to get it well round, the change come so oncommon plump; didn’t it?”"
"不知为什么，乔对我这么放心，我反而不是很高兴。我本希望他能流露出感情，或者说“这给你增光了，皮普”，或者其他类似的话。因此，对于乔的第一点我什么也没说，仅仅针对他的第二点说道，消息确实来得突然，但我一直以来都想成为一个上流社会的绅士，而且时常猜想如果我是个上流绅士，我会做些什么。","Somehow, I was not best pleased with Joe’s being so mightily secure of me.I should have liked him to have betrayed emotion, or to have said, “It does you credit, Pip,” or something of that sort.Therefore, I made no remark on Joe’s first head: merely saying as to his second, that the tidings had indeed come suddenly, but that I had always wanted to be a gentleman, and had often and often speculated on what I would do, if I were one."
"“你有这么想过？”乔说，“太不可思议了！”","“Have you though?” said Joe.“Astonishing!”"
"“现在想想真可惜，乔，”我说，“我们之前在这里上课的时候，你没有多学点东西，是不是？”","“It’s a pity now, Joe,” said I, “that you did not get on a little more, when we had our lessons here; isn’t it?”"
"“这个嘛，我也说不准。”乔回答说，“我太笨了。我就只懂我自己的行当。一直都觉得很遗憾，我是个很笨的人。虽然十二个月前的今天是遗憾的，可如今已经不再是遗憾的事情了，不是吗？”","“Well, I don’t know,” returned Joe.“I’m so awful dull.I’m only master of my own trade.It were always a pity as I was so awful dull; but it’s no more of a pity now, than it was—this day twelvemonth—don’t you see?”"
"我的本意是，当我继承了财产，有能力为乔做点事的时候，如果他能更有资格接受身份地位的提高，那就更好了。他完全不懂我的意思，不过我想还是跟比迪讲会更好。","What I had meant was, that when I came into my property and was able to do something for Joe, it would have been much more agreeable if he had been better qualified for a rise in station.He was so perfectly innocent of my meaning, however, that I thought I would mention it to Biddy in preference."
"所以，我们走回家喝完茶之后，我把比迪带到巷边的小花园里。我先告诉她我永远都不会忘了她，以此来振奋她的精神，然后说我想请她帮我个忙。","So, when we had walked home and had had tea, I took Biddy into our little garden by the side of the lane, and, after throwing out in a general way for the elevation of her spirits, that I should never forget her, said I had a favor to ask of her."
"“是这样的，比迪，”我说，“我希望你不会错过任何一个机会来帮助乔进步，哪怕是一点点的进步。”","“And it is, Biddy,” said I, “that you will not omit any opportunity of helping Joe on, a little.”"
"“怎么帮助他进步？”比迪沉着地看了我一眼问道。","“How helping him on?” asked Biddy, with a steady sort of glance. "
"“唉！乔是个很好的朋友——事实上，我觉得他是有史以来最好的朋友了——但是他在有些事情上非常迟钝。比如，比迪，在他的学问以及他的言谈举止上。”","“Well! Joe is a dear good fellow—in fact, I think he is the dearest fellow that ever lived—but he is rather backward in some things.For instance, Biddy, in his learning and his manners.”"
"尽管我说话的时候一直看着比迪，而且我说完之后比迪把眼睛睁得老大，但她没有看我。","Although I was looking at Biddy as I spoke, and although she opened her eyes very wide when I had spoken, she did not look at me."
"“噢，他的言谈举止！那么，他的言谈举止不好吗？”比迪一边问道，一边摘下了一片黑醋栗树叶。","“Oh, his manners! Won’t his manners do, then?” asked Biddy, plucking a black-currant leaf. "
"“我亲爱的比迪，他的言谈举止在这里是很好——”","“My dear Biddy, they do very well here—”"
"“哦！在这里很好？”比迪插话进来说，同时仔细地看着她手里的树叶。","“Oh! they do very well here?” interrupted Biddy, looking closely at the leaf in her hand."
"“听我说完——但是我希望，在我完全继承财产之后让乔进入更上层的社会，到那时候，他的这种言谈举止就对他没有什么好处。”","“Hear me out—but if I were to remove Joe into a higher sphere, as I shall hope to remove him when I fully come into my property, they would hardly do him justice.”"
"“你不觉得他懂这一点吗？”比迪问道。","“And don’t you think he knows that?” asked Biddy."
"这个提问很刺激人（因为我一点都没有想到她会问这个问题），我恶狠狠地说：“比迪，你什么意思？”","It was such a very provoking question (for it had never in the most distant manner occurred to me), that I said, snappishly, “Biddy, what do you mean?”"
"比迪用两手把树叶揉碎——自那以后，每当闻到黑醋栗树丛的味道，我就会想起在巷边小花园里的那个晚上——她说：“你从来都没有想过，也许他也有自尊心吗？”","Biddy having rubbed the leaf to pieces between her hands—and the smell of a black-currant bush has ever since recalled to me that evening in the little garden by the side of the lane—said, “Have you never considered that he may be proud?”"
"“自尊心？”我用轻蔑的强调语气重复道。","“Proud?” I repeated, with disdainful emphasis."
"“噢！自尊心有很多种。”比迪说着正视着我，摇了摇头，“自尊心不仅仅只有一种——”","“Oh! there are many kinds of pride,” said Biddy, looking full at me and shaking her head; “pride is not all of one kind—”"
"“怎么了？为什么停下来了？”我说。","“Well? What are you stopping for?” said I."
"“不仅仅只有一种，”比迪续说道，“他可能自尊心太强，所以不想让任何人带他离开这个地方。他有能力适应这里，而且适应地非常好，过得有尊严。实话告诉你，我觉得他就是这样的人：尽管我这样说听起来很鲁莽，毕竟你比我更了解他。”","“Not all of one kind,” resumed Biddy.“He may be too proud to let any one take him out of a place that he is competent to fill, and fills well and with respect.To tell you the truth, I think he is: though it sounds bold in me to say so, for you must know him far better than I do.”"
"“唉，比迪，”我说，“我很遗憾看到你是这样的人。我没想到你是这样的人。你又嫉妒、又不情愿，比迪。你对我交了好运十分不满，而且情不自禁地表现出来。”","“Now, Biddy,” said I, “I am very sorry to see this in you.I did not expect to see this in you.You are envious, Biddy, and grudging.You are dissatisfied on account of my rise in fortune, and you can’t help showing it.”"
"“如果你执意这么认为的话，”比迪回答说，“那你就这么说吧。你就一直这么说下去吧，要是你执意这么认为的话。”","“If you have the heart to think so,” returned Biddy, “say so.Say so over and over again, if you have the heart to think so.”"
"“你的意思是你要执意这么做吧，比迪，”我用高傲、自负的口吻说道，“别把它算在我的头上。我很遗憾看到这一点，这是——这是人性的丑恶面。我的确打算请你在我离开之后，利用你所能抓住的任何一点机会帮助乔进步。但是现在，我什么也不用你帮忙了。我非常遗憾看到你是这样的人，比迪。”我重复道，“这是——这是人性的丑恶面。”","“If you have the heart to be so, you mean, Biddy,” said I, in a virtuous and superior tone; “don’t put it off upon me.I am very sorry to see it, and it’s a—it’s a bad side of human nature.I did intend to ask you to use any little opportunities you might have after I was gone, of improving dear Joe.But after this, I ask you nothing.I am extremely sorry to see this in you, Biddy,” I repeated.“It’s a—it’s a bad side of human nature.”"
"“不管你是责备我还是赞扬我，”可怜的比迪回答说，“你都可以放心，我会在这里尽力做好我力所能及的所有事情，一直都会的。不管你怎么看待我，都不会改变我对你的看法。不过一个上流绅士也不应该不公正。”比迪说着把头转到一边。","“Whether you scold me or approve of me,” returned poor Biddy, “you may equally depend upon my trying to do all that lies in my power, here, at all times.And whatever opinion you take away of me, shall make no difference in my remembrance of you.Yet a gentleman should not be unjust neither,” said Biddy, turning away her head."
"我又情绪激动地重复说，这是人性的丑恶面（不管用在这里对不对，关于这种观点本身，自那之后我所目睹的世事都让我有理由相信我是对的），然后就沿着小路从比迪身边走开了。比迪进了屋，我走出花园大门，沮丧地踱着步，一直踱到晚饭时间。再一次让我感到悲伤和奇怪的是，我交上好运的第二个晚上竟和第一个晚上一样的孤独，一样的令人不满意。","I again warmly repeated that it was a bad side of human nature (in which sentiment, waiving its application, I have since seen reason to think I was right), and I walked down the little path away from Biddy, and Biddy went into the house, and I went out at the garden gate and took a dejected stroll until supper-time; again feeling it very sorrowful and strange that this, the second night of my bright fortunes, should be as lonely and unsatisfactory as the first."
"但是，次日清晨的到来再一次让我心情大好，我仁慈地原谅了比迪，我们不再谈论那个话题。穿上我现有的最好的衣服之后，我早早地就来到镇上，希望商店一开门我就进去。当我来到特拉布先生的裁缝铺时，他正在店铺后面的客厅里吃早餐。他觉得不值得出来招待我，于是就把我叫进去见他。","But, morning once more brightened my view, and I extended my clemency to Biddy, and we dropped the subject.Putting on the best clothes I had, I went into town as early as I could hope to find the shops open, and presented myself before Mr. Trabb, the tailor: who was having his breakfast in the parlor behind his shop, and who did not think it worth his while to come out to me, but called me in to him."
"“嗨！”特拉布先生用一副跟我很熟的样子说道，“你好吗，我能为你做点什么？”","“Well!” said Mr. Trabb, in a hail-fellow-well-met kind of way.“How are you, and what can I do for you?”"
"特拉布先生已经把他的热面包圈切成三片，现在正往面包片上涂黄油，然后拿另一片面包盖上。他是个有钱的老光棍，他那扇打开的窗户外面是一个茂盛的小果园，在他火炉旁边的那面墙上有一个气派的铁保险柜，我毫不怀疑地相信，他那成堆的财富都分袋装好，放在这个保险柜里。","Mr. Trabb had sliced his hot roll into three feather beds, and was slipping butter in between the blankets, and covering it up.He was a prosperous old bachelor, and his open window looked into a prosperous little garden and orchard, and there was a prosperous iron safe let into the wall at the side of his fireplace, and I did not doubt that heaps of his prosperity were put away in it in bags."
"“特拉布先生，”我说，“我很不乐意提起这件事，因为听起来很像是在炫耀，但我不得不说的是，我已经得到了一大笔财产。”","“Mr. Trabb,” said I, “it’s an unpleasant thing to have to mention, because it looks like boasting; but I have come into a handsome property.”"
"特拉布先生的行为立刻发生了变化。他已经顾不得往面包片上涂黄油了，从床边跳起来，在桌布上擦了擦手指，喊道：“天哪！”","A change passed over Mr. Trabb.He forgot the butter in bed, got up from the bedside, and wiped his fingers on the table-cloth, exclaiming, “Lord bless my soul!”"
"“我不久就要去伦敦找我的监护人了。”我一边说着，一边随意地从口袋里掏出几个几尼，看着这些钱又接着说道，“我想做套时髦的衣服，去的时候穿。我希望现在就付给你现金。”我补充了一句——否则我想他可能只是假装会给我做。","“I am going up to my guardian in London,” said I, casually drawing some guineas out of my pocket and looking at them; “and I want a fashionable suit of clothes to go in.I wish to pay for them,” I added—otherwise I thought he might only pretend to make them—“with ready money.”"
"“我亲爱的先生，”特拉布先生说着恭敬地弯下了腰，张开双臂，主动地放在我两个胳膊肘的外侧，“别说这些伤和气的话。我能跟您道贺吗？您能给我个面子到店里去吗？”","“My dear sir,” said Mr. Trabb, as he respectfully bent his body, opened his arms, and took the liberty of touching me on the outside of each elbow, “don’t hurt me by mentioning that.May I venture to congratulate you?Would you do me the favor of stepping into the shop?”"
"特拉布先生的伙计是乡下这一带最大胆的伙计。我之前走进店铺的时候，他正在扫地。他干得很卖力，都把灰尘扫到我身上来了。当我和特拉布先生从里面出来进入店铺的时候，他还在打扫。他拿着扫帚用力地清扫所有的角落和物体，以此来显示（我是这么理解的）他和所有在世或去世的铁匠一样平等。","Mr. Trabb’s boy was the most audacious boy in all that countryside.When I had entered he was sweeping the shop, and he had sweetened his labors by sweeping over me.He was still sweeping when I came out into the shop with Mr. Trabb, and he knocked the broom against all possible corners and obstacles, to express (as I understood it) equality with any blacksmith, alive or dead."
"“小点声，”特拉布先生及其严厉地说道，“否则我拧掉你的头！请您赏脸坐下吧，先生。来，看这个，”特拉布先生说着取下一卷布匹，把它像潮水一般在柜台上铺开，用手托起布料向我展示它的光泽，“这可是上等的好料子。我建议您用它来做衣服，因为这真的是特别好的布料。不过您也可以看看其他的布料。你，去把四号布料给我拿来！”（他对那个伙计说道，同时还恶狠狠地瞪了他一眼，警告那个小混蛋拿布料来时别碰到我或是做出其他不恭敬的事情。）","“Hold that noise,” said Mr. Trabb, with the greatest sternness, “or I’ll knock your head off!Do me the favor to be seated, sir.Now, this,” said Mr. Trabb, taking down a roll of cloth, and tiding it out in a flowing manner over the counter, preparatory to getting his hand under it to show the gloss, “is a very sweet article.I can recommend it for your purpose, sir, because it really is extra super.But you shall see some others.Give me Number Four, you!”(To the boy, and with a dreadfully severe stare: foreseeing the danger of that miscreant’s brushing me with it, or making some other sign of familiarity.)"
"直到那个伙计把四号布料平铺在柜台上，并再次与我们保持了安全的距离之后，特拉布先生才把严厉的目光从他身上移开。然后，他命令他取来五号布料和八号布料。“你可别在这里跟我耍花招，”特拉布先生说，“否则你会后悔的，你这个小混帐，后悔一辈子。”","Mr. Trabb never removed his stern eye from the boy until he had deposited number four on the counter and was at a safe distance again.Then, he commanded him to bring number five, and number eight.“And let me have none of your tricks here,” said Mr. Trabb, “or you shall repent it, you young scoundrel, the longest day you have to live.”"
"然后特拉布先生弯下身来展示四号布料，用一种毕恭毕敬而又很有把握的口吻向我推荐说，这款布料很轻盈，适合夏天穿，在贵族和中上层人士当中很流行，以后他会一直很荣幸地记得有这样一位高贵的同乡（如果他能有幸把我视为他的同乡的话）曾经穿过这种布料做成的衣服。“你还不把五号布料和八号布料取来，你这个混帐。”特拉布先生跟我说完后对那个伙计说道，“你是想让我把你赶出店铺，然后我自己去取是吗？”","Mr. Trabb then bent over number four, and in a sort of deferential confidence recommended it to me as a light article for summer wear, an article much in vogue among the nobility and gentry, an article that it would ever be an honour to him to reflect upon a distinguished fellow-townsman’s (if he might claim me for a fellow-townsman) having worn.“Are you bringing numbers five and eight, you vagabond,” said Mr. Trabb to the boy after that, “or shall I kick you out of the shop and bring them myself?”"
"在特拉布先生眼力的帮助下，我选好一种布料来做衣服，然后又来到客厅量尺寸。因为，尽管特拉布先生已经知道了我的尺寸，而且在此之前一直对这一尺寸非常满意，现在他却很抱歉地说：“那个尺寸在如今的形势下已经不能用了，先生——根本就不能用了。”所以，特拉布先生在客厅里测量并计算了我的尺寸，仿佛我就是一片土地，而他是最好的土地勘测员。整个过程让他大费周章，这让我觉得根本没有哪件衣服能补偿他付出的辛劳。最后，他终于量好了尺寸，我让他星期四晚上把衣服送到彭波契克先生家里。这时，他把手放在客厅的门锁上说道：“我知道，先生，伦敦的绅士通常是不会光顾当地的小店的，但是如果您能看在同乡的份上时常来我这里光顾的话，我一定会感激不尽的。再见了，先生，非常感谢。门！”","I selected the materials for a suit, with the assistance of Mr. Trabb’s judgment, and re-entered the parlor to be measured.For, although Mr. Trabb had my measure already, and had previously been quite contented with it, he said apologetically that it “wouldn’t do under existing circumstances, sir—wouldn’t do at all.”So, Mr. Trabb measured and calculated me, in the parlor, as if I were an estate and he the finest species of surveyor, and gave himself such a world of trouble that I felt that no suit of clothes could possibly remunerate him for his pains.When he had at last done and had appointed to send the articles to Mr. Pumblechook’s on the Thursday evening, he said, with his hand upon the parlor lock, “I know, sir, that London gentlemen cannot be expected to patronize local work, as a rule; but if you would give me a turn now and then in the quality of a townsman, I should greatly esteem it.Good morning, sir, much obliged.—Door!”"
"最后一个字是冲那个伙计喊的，可他却根本不明白这是什么意思。但是当他的主人摩挲着手把我送出门的时候，我看到他一屁股瘫坐在地。这是我第一次明确地体会到金钱的巨大力量，它从精神上击垮了特拉布的伙计。","The last word was flung at the boy, who had not the least notion what it meant.But I saw him collapse as his master rubbed me out with his hands, and my first decided experience of the stupendous power of money, was, that it had morally laid upon his back, Trabb’s boy."
"在这个难忘的事件之后，我去了帽店、靴子店以及袜店。我感觉自己就像哈伯德妈妈的狗一样，全身一套装备需要那么多行业来提供。我还去了驿站，预定了星期六早上七点的马车。我不必每到一处都解释说我刚刚得到一大笔财产，但只要我一提及此事，接下来，正在接待我的店主就马上把注意力从窗外的大街上收回来，一门心思地招呼我。我订好我需要的所有东西之后就朝彭波契克先生家走去。当我走近这位绅士的商铺时，我看见他正站在门口。","After this memorable event, I went to the hatter’s, and the bootmaker’s, and the hosier’s, and felt rather like Mother Hubbard’s dog whose outfit required the services of so many trades.I also went to the coach-office and took my place for seven o’clock on Saturday morning.It was not necessary to explain everywhere that I had come into a handsome property; but whenever I said anything to that effect, it followed that the officiating tradesman ceased to have his attention diverted through the window by the High-street, and concentrated his mind upon me.When I had ordered everything I wanted, I directed my steps towards Pumblechook’s, and, as I approached that gentleman’s place of business, I saw him standing at his door."
"他正非常焦急地等着我。他一早就坐着轻便马车去了铁匠铺，听说了这个消息。他已经在那个上演过巴恩韦尔的客厅里为我备好了点心，他还命令他的店员说，当我这个高贵的客人经过的时候，不许在过道那里挡路。","He was waiting for me with great impatience.He had been out early in the chaise-cart, and had called at the forge and heard the news.He had prepared a collation for me in the Barnwell parlor, and he too ordered his shopman to “come out of the gangway” as my sacred person passed."
"“我亲爱的朋友，”当客厅里只剩下我和他以及点心时，他抓着我的双手说道，“我祝贺您交上了好运。应得的，应得的！”","“My dear friend,” said Mr. Pumblechook, taking me by both hands, when he and I and the collation were alone, “I give you joy of your good fortune.Well deserved, well deserved!”"
"这话马上就要说到那一点上了，我觉得他用很明智的方式表达了自己的看法。","This was coming to the point, and I thought it a sensible way of expressing himself."
"“只要一想到，”彭波契克先生哼着鼻子赞美了我一会儿之后说道，“我为促成这件事还尽了微薄之力，我就感到万分荣幸啊。”","“To think,” said Mr. Pumblechook, after snorting admiration at me for some moments, “that I should have been the humble instrument of leading up to this, is a proud reward.”"
"我请求彭波契克先生记住，永远都不要提及或暗示那一点。","I begged Mr. Pumblechook to remember that nothing was to be ever said or hinted, on that point."
"“我亲爱的年轻朋友，”彭波契克先生说，“如果您允许我这样称呼您的话——”","“My dear young friend,” said Mr. Pumblechook, “if you will allow me to call you so—”"
"我小声说了句“当然可以”，于是彭波契克先生又抓住我的双手，一并牵动了他的背心，看起来像是动了真情，尽管非常虚伪做作，“我亲爱的年轻朋友，请相信我，您不在的时候，我一定会尽我的微薄之力来提醒约瑟夫记住这件事的。约瑟夫！”彭波契克先生用同情的命令口气说道，“约瑟夫！约瑟夫！”然后他摇了摇头，又拍了拍脑袋，以示他了解乔的缺点。","I murmured “Certainly,” and Mr. Pumblechook took me by both hands again, and communicated a movement to his waistcoat, which had an emotional appearance, though it was rather low down, “My dear young friend, rely upon my doing my little all in your absence, by keeping the fact before the mind of Joseph.—Joseph!” said Mr. Pumblechook, in the way of a compassionate adjuration. “Joseph! Joseph!!!”Thereupon he shook his head and tapped it, expressing his sense of deficiency in Joseph."
"“不过，我亲爱的年轻朋友，”彭波契克先生说，“您一定饿了，一定累了。快请坐。这是从“蓝野猪”饭店买来的鸡肉，这是从“蓝野猪”饭店买来的舌头，还有这是从“蓝野猪”饭店买来的一两样小吃，我希望您不会嫌弃。但是，”彭波契克先生刚坐下又站起来说道，“我眼前看到的这个人，还是不是我曾经逗他玩，让他度过童年快乐时光的那个人呢？　我可不可以——可不可以——？”","“But my dear young friend,” said Mr. Pumblechook, “you must be hungry, you must be exhausted.Be seated.Here is a chicken had round from the Boar, here is a tongue had round from the Boar, here’s one or two little things had round from the Boar, that I hope you may not despise.But do I,” said Mr. Pumblechook, getting up again the moment after he had sat down, “see afore me, him as I ever sported with in his times of happy infancy?And may I—may I—?”"
"这个“我可不可以”的意思是他可不可以和我握手。我同意了，于是他热情地握了我的手，然后又坐了下来。","This May I, meant might he shake hands?I consented, and he was fervent, and then sat down again."
"“这有葡萄酒。”彭波契克先生说，“让我们举杯，感谢命运女神，但愿她能永远以同样的识别力来选出她的宠儿！但是我不能，”彭波契克先生又站了起来说道，“看着我眼前的这位宠儿——或者向这位宠儿敬酒——除非我再问一遍——我可不可以——我可不可以——？”","“Here is wine,” said Mr. Pumblechook.“Let us drink, Thanks to Fortune, and may she ever pick out her favorites with equal judgment!And yet I cannot,” said Mr. Pumblechook, getting up again, “see afore me One—and likewise drink to One—without again expressing—May I—may I—?”"
"我说他可以，于是他又和我握了手，然后一口气喝光酒杯里的酒，再把酒杯倒了过来。我也同样这么做了。如果在喝酒之前，我也把自己给倒过来的话，那这酒就不会这么直接地上头了。","I said he might, and he shook hands with me again, and emptied his glass and turned it upside down.I did the same; and if I had turned myself upside down before drinking, the wine could not have gone more direct to my head."
"彭波契克先生给我夹肝尖，夹最好的舌头肉（现在可没有那些没人要的边边角角的猪肉了），而且，相对来说，他根本就不顾及自己。“哈！鸡啊，鸡啊！你万万没想到，”彭波契克先生对着盘中的鸡肉朗诵道，“当你还是个刚会拍打翅膀的小鸡时，你万万没想到以后的命运是怎样的。你万万没想到会成为这卑微屋檐下的一道菜，呈献给这样一位——如果您愿意的话，您可以把这看作是一种迷恋，”彭波契克先生又站起来说道，“不过我可不可以？我可不可以——？”","Mr. Pumblechook helped me to the liver wing, and to the best slice of tongue (none of those out-of-the-way No Thoroughfares of Pork now), and took, comparatively speaking, no care of himself at all.“Ah! poultry, poultry!You little thought,” said Mr. Pumblechook, apostrophizing the fowl in the dish, “when you was a young fledgling, what was in store for you.You little thought you was to be refreshment beneath this humble roof for one as—Call it a weakness, if you will,” said Mr. Pumblechook, getting up again, “but may I? may I—？”"
"现在已经没有必要例行公事般地重复说他可以了，所以他马上和我握了手。我不知道，他是如何做到频繁地握我的手，却没有被我的餐刀伤到自己的。","It began to be unnecessary to repeat the form of saying he might, so he did it at once.How he ever did it so often without wounding himself with my knife, I don’t know."
"“你姐姐，”他稳坐下来吃了点东西之后继续说道，“她真荣幸能把你亲手带大！想想真让人悲伤，她再也无法完全意识到这份荣幸了。我可不可以——”","“And your sister,” he resumed, after a little steady eating, “which had the honour of bringing you up by hand!It’s a sad picter, to reflect that she’s no longer equal to fully understanding the honour. May—”"
"我看到他又要过来跟我握手，于是我制止了他。","I saw he was about to come at me again, and I stopped him."
"“让我们为她的健康干杯。”我说道。","“We’ll drink her health,” said I."
"“啊！”彭波契克先生喊道，同时向后倚靠在椅子上，刚刚的那番赞美已经让他精疲力尽了，“这才是有情有义的人，先生！”（我不知道“先生”指的是谁，但肯定不是指我，不过又没有第三个人在场）“这才是高尚的人，先生！总是那么宽容，那么友善。”恭恭敬敬的彭波契克赶忙放下他那还没有送到嘴边上的酒杯，再次站起来说道：“也许我们这样的普通人都喜欢重复——不过，我可不可以——？”","“Ah!”cried Mr. Pumblechook, leaning back in his chair, quite flaccid with admiration, “that’s the way you know ’em, sir!”(I don’t know who Sir was, but he certainly was not I, and there was no third person present); “that’s the way you know the nobleminded, sir!Ever forgiving and ever affable.”“It might,” said the servile Pumblechook, putting down his untasted glass in a hurry and getting up again, “to a common person, have the appearance of repeating—but may I—?”"
"握过我的手之后，他又坐了下来，为我姐姐的健康而干杯。“我们一直都看到了，”彭波契克先生说，“她脾气暴躁的缺点，不过但愿她的用意是好的。”","When he had done it, he resumed his seat and drank to my sister.“Let us never be blind,” said Mr. Pumblechook, “to her faults of temper, but it is to be hoped she meant well.”"
"就在这时，我开始注意到他的脸上逐渐泛起了红晕，至于我自己，我感觉整张脸都泡在酒里一样，生疼生疼的。","At about this time, I began to observe that he was getting flushed in the face; as to myself, I felt all face, steeped in wine and smarting."
"我告诉彭波契克先生说，我想把做好的新衣服送到他家里来，看到我如此地器重他，他简直是欣喜若狂。我说，我这么做的理由是想避免村里人的注意，他又因此把我夸上了天。他暗示说，除了他自己，没有人值得我信赖，还有——直截了当的就是，他可不可以和我握手？然后他亲切地问我，还记不记得我们顽皮的算术游戏，还记不记得我们是如何一起去订立我的师徒契约的，实际上，也就是问我还记不记得他一直都是我最中意、最喜欢的朋友？即使我喝下的酒是实际上的十倍，我也知道他和我从来都不是这种关系，我打心眼里否认他这种说法。然而，尽管如此，我记得我觉得肯定的是，过去我对他的看法有很大的偏见，他其实是位理智、实际、好心、优秀的老兄。","I mentioned to Mr. Pumblechook that I wished to have my new clothes sent to his house, and he was ecstatic on my so distinguishing him.I mentioned my reason for desiring to avoid observation in the village, and he lauded it to the skies.There was nobody but himself, he intimated, worthy of my confidence, and—in short, might he?Then he asked me tenderly if I remembered our boyish games at sums, and how we had gone together to have me bound apprentice, and, in effect, how he had ever been my favorite fancy and my chosen friend?If I had taken ten times as many glasses of wine as I had, I should have known that he never had stood in that relation towards me, and should in my heart of hearts have repudiated the idea.Yet for all that, I remember feeling convinced that I had been much mistaken in him, and that he was a sensible practical good-hearted prime fellow."
"逐渐地，他对我非常信任，甚至关于他的个人事务也要征求我的意见。他说眼下有个机会，可以在那些经营场所将粮食买卖和种子买卖大规模地合并起来从而实现垄断。一旦生意做大，这将会是这一带或者是周边地区绝无仅有的。他觉得实现这一巨大财富的唯一条件就是拥有更多的资金。就是这两个词：更多资金。如今在他（彭波契克）看来，如果有人为这笔生意投资，此人就可以成为隐名合伙人，先生——隐名合伙人不用做任何事情，而且可以随时亲自或者派代表来查看帐簿——而且可以一年两次前来取走总额高达百分之五十的利润——在他看来，这对有激情、有资产的年轻绅士来说也许是个创业的起点，值得考虑考虑。","By degrees he fell to reposing such great confidence in me, as to ask my advice in reference to his own affairs.He mentioned that there was an opportunity for a great amalgamation and monopoly of the corn and seed trade on those premises, if enlarged, such as had never occurred before in that, or any other neighborhood.What alone was wanting to the realization of a vast fortune, he considered to be More Capital.Those were the two little words, more capital.Now it appeared to him (Pumblechook) that if that capital were got into the business, through a sleeping partner, sir—which sleeping partner would have nothing to do but walk in, by self or deputy, whenever he pleased, and examine the books—and walk in twice a year and take his profits away in his pocket, to the tune of fifty per cent—it appeared to him that that might be an opening for a young gentleman of spirit combined with property, which would be worthy of his attention."
"不过我是怎么想的呢？　他对我的看法很有信心，想听听我是怎么想的。我说出了我的看法。“等一下！”我既深邃又有特色的观点深深地震撼了他，所以他都不再问一下是否可以握我的手，而是说他真的必须要握——于是他又握了我的手。","But what did I think?He had great confidence in my opinion, and what did I think?I gave it as my opinion.“Wait a bit!”The united vastness and distinctness of this view so struck him, that he no longer asked if he might shake hands with me, but said he really must—and did."
"我们喝光了所有的酒，彭波契克先生一再地保证，会让约瑟夫达到标准（我不知道是什么标准），还保证为我提供有效持久的服务（我不知道是什么服务）。他还让我有生以来第一次知道，他一直以来提起我都会这样说——当然，在此之前他一直把这个秘密隐藏地很好——“那个孩子可不是一般的孩子，相信我，他将来的财产可不是一般的财产”。他泪汪汪地微笑着说，现在想想那真是一件奇特的事，我也这样附和道。最终，我来到了户外，隐约感觉到阳光有些异常，而且我发现自己不知怎地就昏昏沉沉地到了公路关卡处。","We drank all the wine, and Mr. Pumblechook pledged himself over and over again to keep Joseph up to the mark (I don’t know what mark), and to render me efficient and constant service (I don’t know what service).He also made known to me for the first time in my life, and certainly after having kept his secret wonderfully well, that he had always said of me, “That boy is no common boy, and mark me, his fortun’ will be no common fortun’.”He said with a tearful smile that it was a singular thing to think of now, and I said so too.Finally, I went out into the air, with a dim perception that there was something unwonted in the conduct of the sunshine, and found that I had slumberously got to the turn-pike without having taken any account of the road."
"在那里，我被彭波契克先生的喊声惊醒。他正沿着阳光明媚的大街一路赶来，同时朝我做着各种手势让我停下来。我停下脚步，他上气不接下气地赶了上来。","There, I was roused by Mr. Pumblechook’s hailing me.He was a long way down the sunny street, and was making expressive gestures for me to stop.I stopped, and he came up breathless."
"“不行，我亲爱的朋友，”当他喘过气来，可以说话时就说道，“我可受不了这样。没有得到您亲切、友善的表示，今天这个场合就不能完整地结束。——作为您的老朋友和您的祝福者，我可不可以？可不可以？”","“No, my dear friend,” said he, when he had recovered wind for speech.“Not if I can help it.This occasion shall not entirely pass without that affability on your part.—May I, as an old friend and well-wisher?May I?”"
"这至少是我们第一百次握手了，之后他极其愤怒地命令一个年轻的车夫给我让路。然后，他祝福了我，而且站在那里向我挥手告别，直到我在路口转弯为止。之后我走进一片地里，在一道树篱下睡了许久，然后才继续上路回家。","We shook hands for the hundredth time at least, and he ordered a young carter out of my way with the greatest indignation.Then, he blessed me and stood waving his hand to me until I had passed the crook in the road; and then I turned into a field and had a long nap under a hedge before I pursued my way home."
"我去伦敦随身带的行李很少，因为我本来东西就少，而其中能配得上我新地位的就更少了。但是，我还是在当天下午就开始打点行装，忙乱地把我知道明天早上要用到的东西收拾好，因为我想，到时候一刻也不能耽搁。","I had scant luggage to take with me to London, for little of the little I possessed was adapted to my new station.But, I began packing that same afternoon, and wildly packed up things that I knew I should want next morning, in a fiction that there was not a moment to be lost."
"就这样，星期二、星期三、星期四终于过去了。星期五一早，我就去彭波契克家穿上我的新衣服，然后去拜访郝维仙小姐。彭波契克先生把他自己的房间贡献出来给我换衣服，而且还特意为此在房间里放上干净的毛巾。当然，我的衣服很让人失望。很可能自从有了衣服以来，每当人们穿上一件盼望已久的新衣服时，都会感到一点点失望。我穿上新衣服之后，站在彭波契克先生那面小小的穿衣镜前摆出各种各样的姿势，却还是看不到我的腿。就这样折腾了半个小时左右，才觉得更合身了一点。这天上午，在距此地大概十英里左右的邻镇上有个集市，所以彭波契克先生不在家。我没有确切地告诉他我打算什么时候离开，所以在离开之前不太可能再跟他握手了。事情本来就应该如此，所以我就穿着新衣服离开了。我感到非常难为情，却还是不得不从店里的伙计面前经过。我总是觉得，自己被束缚了手脚，浑身不自在，就像乔穿着他的节日礼服一样。","So, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, passed; and on Friday morning I went to Mr. Pumblechook’s, to put on my new clothes and pay my visit to Miss Havisham.Mr. Pumblechook’s own room was given up to me to dress in, and was decorated with clean towels expressly for the event.My clothes were rather a disappointment, of course.Probably every new and eagerly expected garment ever put on since clothes came in, fell a trifle short of the wearer’s expectation.But after I had had my new suit on, some half an hour, and had gone through an immensity of posturing with Mr. Pumblechook’s very limited dressing-glass, in the futile endeavor to see my legs, it seemed to fit me better.It being market morning at a neighboring town some ten miles off, Mr. Pumblechook was not at home.I had not told him exactly when I meant to leave, and was not likely to shake hands with him again before departing.This was all as it should be, and I went out in my new array: fearfully ashamed of having to pass the shopman, and suspicious after all that I was at a personal disadvantage, something like Joe’s in his Sunday suit."
"我从小路绕到郝维仙小姐家，费力地按响了门铃，因为我手套的指头又硬又长。萨拉·鄱凯特来到大门口，当她见我变化这么大时，着实吃了一惊，她那胡桃壳般的面容也从棕色变成了青黄色。","I went circuitously to Miss Havisham’s by all the back ways, and rang at the bell constrainedly, on account of the stiff long fingers of my gloves.Sarah Pocket came to the gate, and positively reeled back when she saw me so changed; her walnut-shell countenance likewise, turned from brown to green and yellow."
"“是你？”她说道，“真的是你，天哪！你想干什么？”","“You?” said she.“You, good gracious!What do you want?”"
"“我就要去伦敦了，鄱凯特小姐，”我说，“我想跟郝维仙小姐道个别。”","“I am going to London, Miss Pocket,” said I, “and want to say good-bye to Miss Havisham.”"
"我来得太突然，所以她锁上大门后把我留在院子里，她进去问一下我是否可以进来。很快她就回来了，把我带上去。一路上她都在盯着我看。","I was not expected, for she left me locked in the yard, while she went to ask if I were to be admitted.After a very short delay, she returned and took me up, staring at me all the way."
"郝维仙小姐正拄着拐杖，在那个摆放着长宴会桌的房间里锻炼。这个房间像往常一样点着蜡烛，听到我们进来，她停了下来，转过身。当时她正好就站在那个发霉的结婚蛋糕旁边。","Miss Havisham was taking exercise in the room with the long spread table, leaning on her crutch stick.The room was lighted as of yore, and at the sound of our entrance, she stopped and turned.She was then just abreast of the rotted bride-cake."
"“你别走，萨拉。”她说道，“什么事，皮普？”","“Don’t go, Sarah,” she said.“Well, Pip?”"
"“我要去伦敦了，郝维仙小姐，明天就走。”我说每一个字都非常小心，“我想您这么友善，应该不会介意我离开您吧。”","“I start for London, Miss Havisham, tomorrow,” I was exceedingly careful what I said, “and I thought you would kindly not mind my taking leave of you.”"
"“这身衣服很好看，皮普。”她说着拿起拐杖在我周围指指点点，仿佛她就是那个改变了我的教母，现在正在施展魔法，完成对我的恩赐一样。","“This is a gay figure, Pip,” said she, making her crutch stick play round me, as if she, the fairy godmother who had changed me, were bestowing the finishing gift."
"“上次见过您之后，我就交上了这样的好运，郝维仙小姐。”我小声说道，“对此，我感激不尽，郝维仙小姐！”","“I have come into such good fortune since I saw you last, Miss Havisham,” I murmured.“And I am so grateful for it, Miss Havisham!”"
"“哎，哎！”她一边看着既困窘又嫉妒的萨拉，一边高兴地说，“我已经见过贾格尔斯先生了。","“Ay, ay!” said she, looking at the discomfited and envious Sarah, with delight.“I have seen Mr. Jaggers."
"我都听说了，皮普。那么，你明天就出发了？”","I have heard about it, Pip.So you go tomorrow?”"
"“是的，郝维仙小姐。”","“Yes, Miss Havisham.”"
"“你是被一个有钱人收养了吗？”","“And you are adopted by a rich person?”"
"“是的，郝维仙小姐。”","“Yes, Miss Havisham.”"
"“不知道姓名？”","“Not named?”"
"“不知道，郝维仙小姐。”","“No, Miss Havisham.”"
"“贾格尔斯先生成为你的监护人，是吗？”","“And Mr. Jaggers is made your guardian?”"
"“是的，郝维仙小姐。”","“Yes, Miss Havisham.”"
"她对这些问题以及回答都非常满意，而萨拉·鄱凯特嫉妒、哀伤的神情更加让她高兴不已。“好吧！”她继续说道，“你前途无量啊。好好表现——别辜负这个机会——而且要听从贾格尔斯先生的教导。”她看了看我，又看了看萨拉，萨拉的表情让她警觉的脸上露出一丝残酷的笑容。“再见了，皮普！——你知道，你要一直用‘皮普’这个名字。”","She quite gloated on these questions and answers, so keen was her enjoyment of Sarah Pocket’s jealous dismay.“Well!” she went on; “you have a promising career before you.Be good—deserve it—and abide by Mr. Jaggers’ instructions.”She looked at me, and looked at Sarah, and Sarah’s countenance wrung out of her watchful face a cruel smile.“Good-bye, Pip!—you will always keep the name of Pip, you know.”"
"“是的，郝维仙小姐。”","“Yes, Miss Havisham.”"
"“再见，皮普！”","“Good-bye, Pip!”"
"她伸出一只手，我单膝跪下，将她的手放在嘴唇上吻了一下。我之前并没有想过我应该如何跟她告别，当时，我自然而然地就这么做了。她看着萨拉·鄱凯特，怪异的眼神中带着胜利的喜悦。于是我离开了我的教母，她双手拄着拐杖站在烛光昏暗的房间里，身边是那个结满蜘蛛网、发了霉的结婚蛋糕。","She stretched out her hand, and I went down on my knee and put it to my lips.I had not considered how I should take leave of her; it came naturally to me at the moment, to do this.She looked at Sarah Pocket with triumph in her weird eyes, and so I left my fairy godmother, with both her hands on her crutch stick, standing in the midst of the dimly lighted room beside the rotten bride-cake that was hidden in cobwebs."
"萨拉·鄱凯特把我领了出去，就好像我是个鬼魂，必须看着我出去才行。她还是适应不了我的打扮，而且非常困惑。我说“再见，鄱凯特小姐”，但她只是盯着我，似乎精力不太集中，根本不知道我说过什么。一走出那座房子，我就飞快地赶回彭波契克家里，换下我的新衣服，把它们包起来，然后穿着我的旧衣服回家——说实话，尽管我得提着一个包赶路，但提着它让我感觉自在多了。","Sarah Pocket conducted me down, as if I were a ghost who must be seen out.She could not get over my appearance, and was in the last degree confounded.I said “Good-bye, Miss Pocket;” but she merely stared, and did not seem collected enough to know that I had spoken.Clear of the house, I made the best of my way back to Pumblechook’s, took off my new clothes, made them into a bundle, and went back home in my older dress, carrying it—to speak the truth—much more at my ease too, though I had the bundle to carry."
"如今，那本以为会过得很慢的六天已经飞快地过去了，明天就在我的眼前，而我却不敢正视它。随着这六个晚上逐渐减少成五个、四个、三个、两个，我也就更加珍惜和乔还有比迪在一起的时间。在最后这一个晚上，为了让他们高兴，我穿上我的新衣服，华丽地坐在那里，直到就寝时间。作为庆祝，我们吃了一顿热气腾腾的晚餐，照例必有的烤鸡让晚餐增色不少，最后我们还喝了点甜啤酒。我们都心情低落，也没有人假装兴高采烈的样子。","And now, those six days which were to have run out so slowly, had run out fast and were gone, and to-morrow looked me in the face more steadily than I could look at it.As the six evenings had dwindled away, to five, to four, to three, to two, I had become more and more appreciative of the society of Joe and Biddy.On this last evening, I dressed my self out in my new clothes, for their delight, and sat in my splendor until bedtime.We had a hot supper on the occasion, graced by the inevitable roast fowl, and we had some flip to finish with.We were all very low, and none the higher for pretending to be in spirits."
"明天一早五点，我就要提着小旅行箱离开村庄了。我已经告诉过乔，我想一个人离开。我很愧疚——非常愧疚——因为我这么做的目的是担心，如果乔和我一起走到驿站的话，我们之间会形成鲜明的对比。我一直跟自己假装说这样的安排没有什么错，可是最后一晚当我走进我的小屋，我觉得必须承认这样也许是不对的，于是有一股冲动想要再冲到楼下，恳求乔明天早上和我一起走到驿站去。我最终没有这样做。","I was to leave our village at five in the morning, carrying my little hand-portmanteau, and I had told Joe that I wished to walk away all alone.I am afraid—sore afraid—that this purpose originated in my sense of the contrast there would be between me and Joe, if we went to the coach together.I had pretended with myself that there was nothing of this taint in the arrangement; but when I went up to my little room on this last night, I felt compelled to admit that it might be so, and had an impulse upon me to go down again and entreat Joe to walk with me in the morning.I did not."
"一整夜，我时睡时醒，梦里坐着马车去的不是伦敦，而是其他的地方，拉车的一会儿是狗，一会儿是猫，一会儿是猪，一会儿又是人——就是没有马。这些离奇的、失败的旅行一直占据着我的大脑，直到黎明到来，小鸟开始唱歌为止。然后我起身穿了几件衣服，坐在窗边，最后看看外面的风景，看着看着竟又睡着了。","All night there were coaches in my broken sleep, going to wrong places instead of to London, and having in the traces, now dogs, now cats, now pigs, now men—never horses.Fantastic failures of journeys occupied me until the day dawned and the birds were singing.Then, I got up and partly dressed, and sat at the window to take a last look out, and in taking it fell asleep."
"比迪很早就起来为我准备早餐，尽管我在窗边睡着了，但没过一个小时，我就闻到厨房里的烟火味了，我想现在一定是傍晚了，这个可怕的念头让我一下子跳了起来。但是在那之后许久，在我听到茶杯叮当声之后的许久，在我已经准备好了之后许久，我还是没有决心下楼去。最终，我就呆在楼上，反复地打开小旅行箱的锁，解开箱子的皮带，再锁上，系好皮带，直到比迪喊道说，我快迟到了。","Biddy was astir so early to get my breakfast, that, although I did not sleep at the window an hour, I smelt the smoke of the kitchen fire when I started up with a terrible idea that it must be late in the afternoon.But long after that, and long after I had heard the clinking of the teacups and was quite ready, I wanted the resolution to go down stairs.After all, I remained up there, repeatedly unlocking and unstrapping my small portmanteau and locking and strapping it up again, until Biddy called to me that I was late."
"我匆忙地吃了早饭，甚至都没有吃出味道来。我从餐桌旁站起来，用一种轻快的口吻说道，仿佛我也是刚刚才想起来似的：“好了！我觉得我得走了！”然后，我吻了吻我姐姐，她还是坐在往日那张椅子上，笑着、点着头、颤抖着。我吻了吻比迪，接着用胳膊搂住乔的脖子。之后，我拿起我的小旅行箱，走了出去。我最后看到他们的情景是，当时我听到身后传来一阵嘈杂声时，我回头看去，发现乔正朝我扔来一只旧鞋，比迪朝我扔来另一只旧鞋。我停下了脚步，挥动着我的帽子。我亲爱的老兄乔挥舞着举过头顶的粗壮的右臂，嘶哑地喊道：“呼嘿！”比迪拿围裙擦了擦眼泪。","It was a hurried breakfast with no taste in it.I got up from the meal, saying with a sort of briskness, as if it had only just occurred to me, “Well! I suppose I must be off!” and then I kissed my sister who was laughing and nodding and shaking in her usual chair, and kissed Biddy, and threw my arms around Joe’s neck.Then I took up my little portmanteau and walked out.The last I saw of them was, when I presently heard a scuffle behind me, and looking back, saw Joe throwing an old shoe after me and Biddy throwing another old shoe.I stopped then, to wave my hat, and dear old Joe waved his strong right arm above his head, crying huskily “Hooroar!” and Biddy put her apron to her face."
"我脚步轻快地往前走，感觉离开比我想象中要容易的多。我还想到，要是在众目睽睽的大街上，可不能在马车后面扔旧鞋子。我吹起了口哨，步伐轻快。但是村庄非常安宁、静谧，薄雾肃穆地升起，仿佛要向我展示这个世界。在这个村子里，我一直以来都是那么无知、那么渺小，而外面的世界是那么神秘、那么广阔，突然一股强烈的感情涌来，我流下了眼泪。此时，我已走到村口的木手指路牌处了，我用手抚摸着路牌说道：“再见了，我亲爱的，亲爱的朋友！”","I walked away at a good pace, thinking it was easier to go than I had supposed it would be, and reflecting that it would never have done to have had an old shoe thrown after the coach, in sight of all the High-street.I whistled and made nothing of going.But the village was very peaceful and quiet, and the light mists were solemnly rising, as if to show me the world, and I had been so innocent and little there, and all beyond was so unknown and great, that in a moment with a strong heave and sob I broke into tears.It was by the finger-post at the end of the village, and I laid my hand upon it, and said,“Good-bye O my dear, dear friend!”"
"上天知道我们从来不必为我们的眼泪而感到羞愧，因为他们就是雨滴，能够冲刷掉覆盖在我们心底、蒙蔽我们思想的灰尘。哭过之后，我感觉比之前好多了——更加难过，更加意识到自己的忘恩负义，更加平静了。要是我之前哭过的话，我就会让乔来送我了。","Heaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears, for they are rain upon the blinding dust of earth, overlying our hard hearts.I was better after I had cried, than before—more sorry, more aware of my own ingratitude, more gentle.If I had cried before, I should have had Joe with me then."
"刚刚流过的眼泪以及我独自赶路时再次迸发出来的眼泪极大地缓和了我的情绪。当我坐在马车上，出了镇之后，我在心里痛苦地思忖着，等到前面换马的时候，我是不是应该跳下马车，往回走，再在家里过一晚，然后更好地告别。我们换了马，但我还没有下定决心，我仍然安慰自己说，等到下一次换马时再下车往回走也行。在我满脑子都想着这些的同时，只要看到路上有人迎面向我们走来，我就会觉得那个人和乔极为相像，我的心跳也就开始加快——要是他真能在这里该多好啊！","So subdued I was by those tears, and by their breaking out again in the course of the quiet walk, that when I was on the coach, and it was clear of the town, I deliberated with an aching heart whether I would not get down when we changed horses and walk back, and have another evening at home, and a better parting.We changed, and I had not made up my mind, and still reflected for my comfort that it would be quite practicable to get down and walk back, when we changed again.And while I was occupied with these deliberations, I would fancy an exact resemblance to Joe in some man coming along the road towards us, and my heart would beat high.—As if he could possibly be there!"
"我们第二次换马、第三次换马，眼下天色已晚，而且我们已经走出很远，所以无法回头了，于是我继续前行。现在大雾已经弥漫开来，世界在我眼前展开。","We changed again, and yet again, and it was now too late and too far to go back, and I went on.And the mists had all solemnly risen now, and the world lay spread before me."
"第二十章","Chapter 20"
"从我们镇乘马车到伦敦大约需要五个小时。正午刚过一会儿，我乘坐的这辆四匹马拉的驿站马车就驶进了伦敦市区繁杂拥挤的车流，然后在齐普塞德伍德大街上“十字钥匙”驿站边停了下来。","The journey from our town to the metropolis, was a journey of about five hours.It was a little past mid-day when the fourhorse stage-coach by which I was a passenger, got into the ravel of traffic frayed out about the Cross Keys, Wood-street, Cheapside, London."
"在那时，我们不列颠人都一致认为，我们这个民族以及我们所拥有的一切都是最优秀的，如果对此表示怀疑，那就是叛国。然而，在我被伦敦的庞大惊呆的同时，我觉得自己可能隐约还有些怀疑，怀疑它其实是非常丑陋、卑鄙、狭隘而肮脏的。","We Britons had at that time particularly settled that it was treasonable to doubt our having and our being the best of everything: otherwise, while I was scared by the immensity of London, I think I might have had some faint doubts whether it was not rather ugly, crooked, narrow, and dirty."
"贾格尔斯先生已经按时将他的地址给我送来了，地点是小不列颠街。他还在卡片上地点的下方写着“史密斯菲尔德广场外缘，靠近驿站”。尽管如此，我还是找来一辆出租马车，驾车的车夫在他油腻腻的外套上披着很多披肩，披肩的数量似乎和他的年纪一样多。他把我安置在马车里，然后用一把叮当作响的折叠式阶梯隔栅把我围起来，就好像他要带我走出五十英里似的。他费了很大功夫才爬上他的座位。我记得那个座位上围挂着一张破旧的豆绿色篷布，经过风吹雨打、虫蛾蛀蚀之后已经破烂不堪了。马车的装备很奇妙，外部有六顶大华盖，后面有些参差不齐的装置，我不知道这可以容许多少男仆随车攀在上面，不过装置的下面还有个耙子，用来防止那些经不住诱惑而企图爬上来的业余男仆。","Mr. Jaggers had duly sent me his address; it was, Little Britain, and he had written after it on his card, “just out of Smithfield, and close by the coach-office.”Nevertheless, a hackney-coachman, who seemed to have as many capes to his greasy great-coat as he was years old, packed me up in his coach and hemmed me in with a folding and jingling barrier of steps, as if he were going to take me fifty miles.His getting on his box, which I remember to have been decorated with an old weather-stained pea-green hammercloth moth-eaten into rags, was quite a work of time.It was a wonderful equipage, with six great coronets outside, and ragged things behind for I don’t know how many footmen to hold on by, and a harrow below them, to prevent amateur footmen from yielding to the temptation."
"我就刚刚有时间欣赏完马车，正寻思着它真像个放置稻草堆的院子，又像个垃圾站，纳闷为什么马的饲料袋要放在车里，这时我注意到车夫要准备下车了，好像我们马上就要停下来了。果然，我们随即在一条阴暗的大街上的一家律师事务所门前停了下来，那家事务所开着门，门上写着“贾格尔斯先生”几个字。","I had scarcely had time to enjoy the coach and to think how like a straw-yard it was, and yet how like a rag-shop, and to wonder why the horses’ nose-bags were kept inside, when I observed the coachman beginning to get down, as if we were going to stop presently.And stop we presently did, in a gloomy street, at certain offices with an open door, whereon was painted MR. JAGGERS."
"“多少钱？”我问那个车夫。","“How much?” I asked the coachman."
"车夫回答说：“一个先令——除非你想多付一点。”","The coachman answered, “A shilling—unless you wish to make it more.”"
"我自然说我不想多付。","I naturally said I had no wish to make it more."
"“那就必须得一个先令。”马车夫说道，“我可不想惹上麻烦。我知道他！”他凶恶地朝贾格尔斯先生的名字闭上一只眼睛，摇了摇头。","“Then it must be a shilling,” observed the coachman.“I don’t want to get into trouble.I know him!”He darkly closed an eye at Mr Jaggers’ name, and shook his head."
"他拿到一个先令之后，又费了很大功夫爬上他的座位，然后就离开了（一副如释重负的样子）。我手里提着小旅行箱走进这家律师事务所，问道：“贾格尔斯先生在不在？”","When he had got his shilling, and had in course of time completed the ascent to his box, and had got away (which appeared to relieve his mind), I went into the front office with my little portmanteau in my hand and asked, Was Mr. Jaggers at home?"
"“他不在。”一个职员回答说，“他正在法院出庭。您是皮普先生吗？”","“He is not,” returned the clerk.“He is in Court at present.Am I addressing Mr. Pip?”"
"我告诉他我就是皮普先生。","I signified that he was addressing Mr. Pip."
"“贾格尔斯先生留下话说，让您在他的房间里等他。他说，他也说不准手上的案子什么时候能结束。但是当然，他的时间是非常宝贵的，所以他不会在外面耽搁太长时间的。”","“Mr. Jaggers left word would you wait in his room.He couldn’t say how long he might be, having a case on.But it stands to reason, his time being valuable, that he won’t be longer than he can help.”"
"说完这些话，这个职员打开一扇门，把我带进后面的一间内室里。在那里，我们看到一位独眼的先生，穿了一件棉绒外套和一条及膝的马裤。他本来正在翻阅报纸，被我们打断之后，就拿袖口擦了擦鼻子。","With those words, the clerk opened a door, and ushered me into an inner chamber at the back.Here, we found a gentleman with one eye, in a velveteen suit and knee-breeches, who wiped his nose with his sleeve on being interrupted in the perusal of the newspaper."
"“出去在外面等着，迈克。”这个职员说道。","“Go and wait outside, Mike,” said the clerk."
"我正要说，我希望自己没有打扰到这位先生——此时那个职员却以我从未见识过的粗鲁方式把他推出房间，还随后把他的皮帽子扔了出去，然后把我一个人留在房间里。","I began to say that I hoped I was not interrupting—when the clerk shoved this gentleman out with as little ceremony as I ever saw used, and tossing his fur cap out after him, left me alone."
"贾格尔斯先生的房间仅靠一个天窗照明，非常阴暗。那个天窗形状古怪，就像一个被打破的脑袋，周围那些变了形的房屋仿佛扭在一起，正透过这个天窗窥视着我。这里没有我预料中那么多的文件，不过这里有一些我没有预料到的古怪东西——比如一支锈迹斑斑的老式手枪，一把带鞘的剑，几个长相奇怪的箱子和包裹，架子上还摆着两个可怕的头像，这两张脸都异常浮肿，鼻子像在抽搐一样。贾格尔斯先生自己的那张高背椅是用纯黑的马毛制成的，四周有几排铜钉，就像一具棺材。我想象得出他倚靠在这张椅子上，对着客户咬食指的样子。这个房间很小，客户们似乎都有向后背靠着墙壁的习惯，尤其是正对着贾格尔斯先生椅子的那面墙，已经被肩膀磨得油光可鉴。我还记得，刚刚在我无辜地成为了独眼先生被赶出去的原因之后，他也是蹭着这面墙壁，拖着脚步出去的。","Mr. Jaggers’ room was lighted by a skylight only, and was a most dismal place; the skylight, eccentrically pitched like a broken head, and the distorted adjoining houses looking as if they had twisted themselves to peep down at me through it.There were not so many papers about, as I should have expected to see; and there were some odd objects about, that I should not have expected to see—such as an old rusty pistol, a sword in a scabbard, several strange-looking boxes and packages, and two dreadful casts on a shelf, of faces peculiarly swollen, and twitchy about the nose.Mr. Jaggers’ own high-backed chair was of deadly black horse-hair, with rows of brass nails round it, like a coffin; and I fancied I could see how he leaned back in it, and bit his forefinger at the clients.The room was but small, and the clients seemed to have had a habit of backing up against the wall: the wall, especially opposite to Mr. Jaggers’ chair, being greasy with shoulders.I recalled, too, that the one-eyed gentleman had shuffled forth against the wall when I was the innocent cause of his being turned out."
"我在贾格尔斯先生椅子对面的那张客户椅子上坐了下来，这里阴沉的气氛强烈地吸引住了我。我想起来，那个职员和他的雇主一样，一副掌握了其他所有人把柄的架势。我想知道楼上还有多少个职员，他们是不是都阴险地掌控着他们的同胞。我想知道屋里所有这些古怪杂物的来历，它们都是怎么出现在这里的。我想知道那两张肿胀的脸是不是贾格尔斯先生的家人。如果他那么不幸，拥有两个如此难看的亲戚，他为什么要把他们摆在那个满是灰尘的地方，任由污垢和苍蝇散落其上，而不把他们放在家里呢？　当然，我之前没有体验过伦敦的夏天，也许我的精神是被这炎热而让人精疲力竭的空气，以及覆盖在所有物品上厚厚的灰沙所压抑了。但是，我就这样坐在贾格尔斯先生封闭的房间里，琢磨着，等待着，直到后来我真的无法忍受那摆放在贾格尔斯先生椅子上方架子上的两个头像了，于是我起身走了出去。","I sat down in the cliental chair placed over against Mr. Jaggers’ chair, and became fascinated by the dismal atmosphere of the place.I called to mind that the clerk had the same air of knowing something to everybody else’s disadvantage, as his master had.I wondered how many other clerks there were up-stairs, and whether they all claimed to have the same detrimental mastery of their fellow-creatures.I wondered what was the history of all the odd litter about the room, and how it came there.I wondered whether the two swollen faces were of Mr. Jaggers’ family, and, if he were so unfortunate as to have had a pair of such ill-looking relations, why he stuck them on that dusty perch for the blacks and flies to settle on, instead of giving them a place at home.Of course I had no experience of a London summer day, and my spirits may have been oppressed by the hot exhausted air, and by the dust and grit that lay thick on everything.But I sat wondering and waiting in Mr. Jaggers’ close room, until I really could not bear the two casts on the shelf above Mr. Jaggers’ chair, and got up and went out."
"我告诉那个职员说，我想在等的同时到外面转一圈，他建议我到路口拐角处转一转，而且说我应该到史密斯菲尔德广场走走。于是，我来到史密斯菲尔德广场。这个可耻的地方满是污垢、油脂、血迹和泡沫，似乎都粘附在我身上。所以为了摆脱这里，我以最快的速度拐进了另一条大街。在这条街上，我看到圣保罗大教堂的黑色大圆顶从一座阴森森的石头建筑后面凸出来，正对着我。一位旁人说，那座石头建筑是纽盖特监狱。沿着监狱的外墙往前走，我发现路面铺着稻草，以此来消除过往车辆的噪音。从这一点上以及周围站着的那些浑身散发出强烈酒气的人的数量上，我推断出里面正在开庭。","When I told the clerk that I would take a turn in the air while I waited, he advised me to go round the corner and I should come into Smithfield.So, I came into Smithfield; and the shameful place, being all asmear with filth and fat and blood and foam, seemed to stick to me.So, I rubbed it off with all possible speed by turning into a street where I saw the great black dome of Saint Paul’s bulging at me from behind a grim stone building which a bystander said was Newgate Prison.Following the wall of the jail, I found the roadway covered with straw to deaden the noise of passing vehicles; and from this, and from the quantity of people standing about, smelling strongly of spirits and beer, I inferred that the trials were on."
"就在我环顾左右的时候，一个非常肮脏、有些醉意的法务大臣问我想不想进去听一场审判。他告诉我，只要给他半克朗，他就能让我坐在前排，这样我就能清楚地看到戴着假发、穿着长袍的首席大法官——他说那个了不得的大人物就像一尊蜡像一样，而且过了一会儿就把他的价格降到了十八个便士。尽管我以有约在身为由拒绝了他的提议，他还是很友好地把我带进院子里，给我看放置绞刑架的地方，还给我看公开鞭打犯人的地方。然后他还带我看死囚大门，罪犯就是从这扇门走出来，走向绞刑架的。为了进一步激起我对那扇恐怖大门的兴趣，他还告诉我说，有四个犯人将在后天早上八点钟走出这扇门，然后一个一个地被绞死。这太恐怖了，让我对伦敦产生了厌恶，更让我厌恶的是这个拿首席大法官来发财的业主身上的穿着（从他的帽子到他的靴子，再到他口袋里的手帕），一切都散发着霉味，这些衣服明显原来不是他的，我心想一定是他从刽子手那里以便宜的价格买来的。在这种情况下，我觉得最好给他一个先令，赶快摆脱他。","While I looked about me here, an exceedingly dirty and partially drunk minister of justice asked me if I would like to step in and hear a trial or so: informing me that he could give me a front place for half-a-crown, whence I should command a full view of the Lord Chief Justice in his wig and robes—mentioning that awful personage like waxwork, and presently offering him at the reduced price of eighteenpence.As I declined the proposal on the plea of an appointment, he was so good as to take me into a yard and show me where the gallows was kept, and also where people were publicly whipped, and then he showed me the Debtors’ Door, out of which culprits came to be hanged: heightening the interest of that dreadful portal by giving me to understand that “four on ’em” would come out at that door the day after to-morrow at eight in the morning, to be killed in a row.This was horrible, and gave me a sickening idea of London: the more so as the Lord Chief Justice’s proprietor wore (from his hat down to his boots and up again to his pocket-handkerchief inclusive) mildewed clothes, which had evidently not belonged to him originally, and which, I took it into my head, he had bought cheap of the executioner.Under these circumstances I thought myself well rid of him for a shilling."
"我回到律师事务所询问贾格尔斯先生有没有回来，在得知他还没有回来后，我就又走了出去。这次，我在小不列颠街转了转，然后进入巴索罗米街。这时我意识到，其他人和我一样，也在等贾格尔斯先生。有两个表情神秘的男子在巴索罗米围场闲逛着，他们一面谈话，一面拿脚踩路面上的裂缝。当他们第一次从我身边经过的时候，我听见其中一个人对另一个人说：“这件事要想办成，就得贾格尔斯来办。”拐角处有三个男的和两个女的凑在一起站在那里，其中一个女的正拿着她那很脏的披肩掩面哭泣，另一个女的把自己的披肩围在肩上，安慰她说道：“贾格尔斯会为他辩护的，阿梅丽亚，你还想要求什么呢？”我正在闲逛的时候，一个矮小的红眼睛犹太人走进了这围场，他把陪他一起来的另一个矮小的犹太人派出去办事情去了。这个跑腿的人一走，我就注意到这个性情容易激动的犹太人就在一个灯柱下面着急地跳来跳去，同时激动地说道：“噢，贾格尔斯，贾格尔斯，贾格尔斯！所有其他的格尔斯，什么克格尔斯、马格尔斯，我都不要，我要贾格尔斯！”这些话证明我的监护人真是大受欢迎，因此给我留下很深的印象，我对他更加敬佩、更加叹服了。","I dropped into the office to ask if Mr. Jaggers had come in yet, and I found he had not, and I strolled out again.This time, I made the tour of Little Britain, and turned into Bartholomew Close; and now I became aware that other people were waiting about for Mr. Jaggers, as well as I.There were two men of secret appearance lounging in Bartholomew Close, and thoughtfully fitting their feet into the cracks of the pavement as they talked together, one of whom said to the other when they first passed me, that “Jaggers would do it if it was to be done.”There was a knot of three men and two women standing at a corner, and one of the women was crying on her dirty shawl, and the other comforted her by saying, as she pulled her own shawl over her shoulders, “Jaggers is for him, ’Melia, and what more could you have?”There was a red-eyed little Jew who came into the Close while I was loitering there, in company with a second little Jew whom he sent upon an errand; and while the messenger was gone, I remarked this Jew, who was of a highly excitable temperament, performing a jig of anxiety under a lamp-post and accompanying himself, in a kind of frenzy, with the words, “Oh Jaggerth, Jaggerth, Jaggerth!All otherth ith Cag-Maggerth, give me Jaggerth!”These testimonies to the popularity of my guardian made a deep impression on me, and I admired and wondered more than ever."
"最后，当我透过巴索罗米围场的铁门看着外面的小不列颠街时，我看见贾格尔斯先生正穿过马路，向我走来。所有其他正在等候他的人也在同一时间看到了他，大家都朝他飞奔过去。贾格尔斯先生一只手搭在我的肩膀上，把我拉在他旁边一起向前走。他什么也没有对我说，只是对跟着他的那些人说话。","At length, as I was looking out at the iron gate of Bartholomew Close into Little Britain, I saw Mr. Jaggers coming across the road towards me.All the others who were waiting, saw him at the same time, and there was quite a rush at him.Mr. Jaggers, putting a hand on my shoulder and walking me on at his side without saying anything to me, addressed himself to his followers."
"首先，他转向那两个神秘男子。","First, he took the two secret men."
"“现在，我对你们无话可说。”贾格尔斯先生用手指指着他们说道，“我不想再知道其他的了。至于结果，都有可能。我一开始就告诉你们，都有可能。你们给温米克付过钱了吗？”","“Now, I have nothing to say to you,” said Mr. Jaggers, throwing his finger at them.“I want to know no more than I know.As to the result, it’s a toss-up.I told you from the first it was a toss-up.Have you paid Wemmick?”"
"“我们今天早上把钱凑齐了，先生。”其中一个人顺从地说道，另一个人则观察着贾格尔斯先生的脸色。","“We made the money up this morning, sir,” said one of the men, submissively, while the other perused Mr. Jaggers’ face."
"“我没问你们什么时候凑齐了，在哪里凑齐的或者有没有凑齐。温米克拿到这笔钱没有？”","“I don’t ask you when you made it up, or where, or whether you made it up at all.Has Wemmick got it?”"
"“拿到了，先生。”两个人一起说道。","“Yes, sir,” said both the men together."
"“很好，那么你们可以走了。现在，我不想再听了！”贾格尔斯先生说着，朝他们一挥手，把他们挡在了身后。“要是你们再跟我说一个字，我就不管这个案子了。”","“Very well; then you may go.Now, I won’t have it!” said Mr Jaggers, waving his hand at them to put them behind him.“If you say a word to me, I’ll throw up the case.”"
"“我们想，贾格尔斯先生——”其中一个人摘下帽子正要说道。","“We thought, Mr. Jaggers—” one of the men began, pulling off his hat."
"“那就是我叫你们不要干的事情。”贾格尔斯先生说，“你们想！我来替你们想，这就够了。如果我想见你们，我知道到哪里去找你们，我不希望你们来找我。现在我不想再听了。我一个字也不想听。”","“That’s what I told you not to do,” said Mr. Jaggers.“You thought! I think for you; that’s enough for you.If I want you, I know where to find you; I don’t want you to find me.Now I won’t have it.I won’t hear a word.”"
"当贾格尔斯先生再次挥手把他们挡在后面时，这两个人看了看彼此，就恭恭敬敬地退到后面，没有再说话。","The two men looked at one another as Mr. Jaggers waved them behind again, and humbly fell back and were heard no more."
"“好了，到你们了！”贾格尔斯先生说着突然停下了脚步，转向那两个围着披肩的女人，那三个男的已经温顺地从她们身边走开了。“哦！阿梅丽亚，是不是？”","“And now you!” said Mr. Jaggers, suddenly stopping, and turning on the two women with the shawls, from whom the three men had meekly separated.—“Oh!Amelia, is it?”"
"“是的，贾格尔斯先生。”","“Yes, Mr. Jaggers.”"
"“你还记不记得，”贾格尔斯先生反问道，“要不是我，你不会在这里，也不可能在这里？”","“And do you remember,” retorted Mr. Jaggers, “that but for me you wouldn’t be here and couldn’t be here?”"
"“噢，是的，先生！”两个女人一齐喊道，“上帝保佑您，先生，我们永远都记得！”","“Oh yes, sir!” exclaimed both women together.“Lord bless you, sir, well we knows that!”"
"“那为什么，”贾格尔斯先生说道，“你们为什么到这里来？”","“Then why,” said Mr. Jaggers, “do you come here?”"
"“为了我的比尔啊，先生！”那个痛哭的女人恳求道。","“My Bill, sir!” the crying woman pleaded."
"“现在，我来告诉你吧！”贾格尔斯先生说道，“一次把话都说清楚了。如果你不知道你的比尔已经找到了好律师的话，我可是知道的。要是你还到这里来为你的比尔唠唠叨叨的话，我就惩治你和比尔两个人，来警告其他人，比尔我就撒手不管了。你给温米克付过钱了吗？”","“Now, I tell you what!” said Mr. Jaggers.“Once for all.If you don’t know that your Bill’s in good hands, I know it.And if you come here, bothering about your Bill, I’ll make an example of both your Bill and you, and let him slip through my fingers.Have you paid Wemmick?”"
"“噢，付过了，先生！一点也不少。”","“Oh yes, sir!Every farden.”"
"“很好。那么你们要做的都已经做完了。再说一个字的话——就一个字——温米克就把钱退给你们。”","“Very well.Then you have done all you have got to do.Say another word—one single word—and Wemmick shall give you your money back.”"
"这个可怕的威胁让这两个女人马上退到后面。现在除了那个容易激动的犹太人之外，没有别人了。这个犹太人已经抓起贾格尔斯先生的大衣衣角送到嘴边吻了好几次。","This terrible threat caused the two women to fall off immediately.No one remained now but the excitable Jew, who had already raised the skirts of Mr. Jaggers’ coat to his lips several times."
"“我不认识这个人！”贾格尔斯先生用同样尖酸刻薄的语气说道，“这个人想要干什么？”","“I don’t know this man!” said Mr. Jaggers, in the same devastating strain: “What does this fellow want?”"
"“我亲爱的贾格尔斯先生。您还记得亚伯拉罕·拉扎鲁斯的弟弟吗？”","“Ma thear Mithter Jaggerth.Hown brother to Habraham Latharuth?”"
"“他是谁？”贾格尔斯先生说道，“放开我的大衣。”","“Who’s he?” said Mr Jaggers.“Let go of my coat.”"
"这个恳求者在松开衣角之前又吻了一次，回答道：“亚伯拉罕·拉扎鲁斯，金银盗窃案的嫌疑犯。”","The suitor, kissing the hem of the garment again before relinquishing it, replied, “Habraham Latharuth, on thuthpithion of plate.”"
"“你来得太迟了，”贾格尔斯先生说道，“我现在站在对方那边。”","“You’re too late,” said Mr. Jaggers.“I am over the way.”"
"“天哪，贾格尔斯先生！”这个容易激动的犹太人脸色变得惨白，大声喊道，“您怎么能反过来对付亚伯拉罕·拉扎鲁斯呢！”","“Holy father, Mithter Jaggerth!” cried my excitable acquaintance, turning white, “don’t thay you’re again Habraham Latharuth!”"
"“的确是这样的，”贾格尔斯先生说，“我们的谈话结束了。让开，别挡路。”","“I am,” said Mr. Jaggers, “and there’s an end of it.Get out of the way.”"
"“贾格尔斯先生！等一下！我表弟已经到温米克先生那里去了，任何条件都答应他。贾格尔斯先生！再等一会儿！要是能把您从对方那里买过来——多少钱都行！——钱不是问题！贾格尔斯先生——先生——！”","“Mithter Jaggerth!Half a moment!My hown cuthen’th gone to Mithter Wemmick at thith prethent minute, to hoffer him hany termth.Mithter Jaggerth!Half a quarter of a moment!If you’d have the condethenthun to be bought off from the t’other thide—at hany thuperior prithe!—money no object!—Mithter Jaggerth—Mithter—!”"
"我的监护人极其冷淡地把他的哀求者赶走，扔下他一个人在马路上又蹦又跳，仿佛踩在烧红的铁块上一样。之后没有人再来阻拦，我们就回到了律师事务所。在那里，我们看到那个职员和那个穿着棉绒大衣、戴着皮帽的人。","My guardian threw his supplicant off with supreme indifference, and left him dancing on the pavement as if it were red-hot.Without further interruption, we reached the front office, where we found the clerk and the man in velveteen with the fur cap."
"“这是迈克。”那个职员从凳子上下来，走近贾格尔斯先生，对他私下说道。","“Here’s Mike,” said the clerk, getting down from his stool, and approaching Mr. Jaggers confidentially."
"“哦！”贾格尔斯先生说着转向那个人，那人此时正拉着自己额头中央的一缕头发，就像《是谁杀了知更鸟》中那头拉着钟绳的公牛一样，“你们的人今天下午过来。是吗？”","“Oh!” said Mr. Jaggers, turning to the man, who was pulling a lock of hair in the middle of his forehead, like the Bull in Cock Robin pulling at the bell-rope; “your man comes on this afternoon. Well?”"
"“是的，贾格尔斯先生，”迈克回答道，他的声音听起来就像自出生时起就患上了感冒一样，“费了好大的劲，总算找到一个，先生，也许能行。”","“Well, Mas’r Jaggers,” returned Mike, in the voice of a sufferer from a constitutional cold; “arter a deal o’ trouble, I’ve found one, sir, as might do.”"
"“他准备如何作证？”","“What is he prepared to swear?”"
"“这个嘛，贾格尔斯先生，”迈克这次用他的皮帽子擦了擦鼻子，说道，“概括地说一下，想到什么就说什么。”","“Well, Mas’r Jaggers,” said Mike, wiping his nose on his fur cap this time; “in a general way, anythink.”"
"贾格尔斯先生突然愤怒起来。“听着，我已经警告过你了，”他用食指指着那个被吓坏了的委托人说道，“要是你胆敢在这里这样说话的话，我一定会好好教训你的。你这个可恶的混蛋，你怎么敢跟我讲这些话？”","Mr. Jaggers suddenly became most irate.“Now, I warned you before,” said he, throwing his forefinger at the terrified client, “that if you ever presumed to talk in that way here, I’d make an example of you.You infernal scoundrel, how dare you tell ME that?”"
"这个委托人看起来很恐慌，也很困惑，好像他根本不知道自己做错了什么。","The client looked scared, but bewildered too, as if he were unconscious what he had done."
"“蠢货！”那个职员拿胳膊肘碰了碰他，低声说道，“死脑筋！这些还用当面说吗？”","“Spooney!” said the clerk, in a low voice, giving him a stir with his elbow.“Soft Head!Need you say it face to face?”"
"“听着，我问你，你这个愚蠢的傻瓜，”我的监护人非常严厉地说道，“再问一次，也是最后一次，你带来的那个人准备如何作证？”","“Now, I ask you, you blundering booby,” said my guardian, very sternly, “once more and for the last time, what the man you have brought here is prepared to swear?”"
"迈克使劲地看着我的监护人，仿佛想尽力从他脸上得到一点启示似的，他慢吞吞地回答说：“说不认识这个人，或者说整晚都和他在一起，没有离开过他，也就没有什么可怀疑的了。”","Mike looked hard at my guardian, as if he were trying to learn a lesson from his face, and slowly replied, “Ayther to character, or to having been in his company and never left him all the night in question.”"
"“听着，要谨慎一点。这个人是什么来历？”","“Now, be careful.In what station of life is this man?”"
"迈克看了看他的帽子，看了看地板，看了看天花板，又看了看那个职员，甚至还看了看我，然后才紧张兮兮地开口回答：“我们把他打扮成了——”突然我的监护人咆哮道：","Mike looked at his cap, and looked at the floor, and looked at the ceiling, and looked at the clerk, and even looked at me, before beginning to reply in a nervous manner, “We’ve dressed him up like—” when my guardian blustered out:"
"“什么？　你们把他打扮？”","“What?You WILL, will you?”"
"（“蠢货！”那个职员又接了一句，同时拿胳膊肘碰了他一下。）","(“Spooney!” added the clerk again, with another stir.)"
"迈克无助地四处看了看，然后明白了几分，又接着说道：","After some helpless casting about, Mike brightened and began again:"
"“他的穿着打扮像是一个体面的馅饼师傅。一种做糕点的厨师。”","“He is dressed like a ’spectable pieman.A sort of a pastry-cook.”"
"“他在这里吗？”我的监护人问道。","“Is he here?” asked my guardian."
"“我让他，”迈克说，“在拐角处一户人家的石阶上等着。”","“I left him,” said Mike, “a settin on some doorsteps round the corner.”"
"“你带着他走过那扇窗户，让我看看他。”","“Take him past that window, and let me see him.”"
"“那扇窗户”指的就是律师事务所的窗户。我们三个走到窗口，站在金属丝制成的百叶窗后面，随后就看见那个委托人假装漫不经心地带着一个凶神恶煞的高个子走了过去。那个高个子穿着一套白色亚麻布制成的短小套装，头戴一顶纸帽子。这个厚道的糕点师傅脑袋肯定不清醒，一只之前被打青了的眼睛正在恢复当中，周围已经变成了绿色，为了盖住这绿色，他还化了妆。","The window indicated, was the office window.We all three went to it, behind the wire blind, and presently saw the client go by in an accidental manner, with a murderous-looking tall individual, in a short suit of white linen and a paper cap.This guileless confectioner was not by any means sober, and had a black eye in the green stage of recovery, which was painted over."
"“告诉他把他的证人直接带走。”我的监护人用极其厌恶的口气对那个职员说道，“问问他带这样一个家伙来是什么意思。”","“Tell him to take his witness away directly,” said my guardian to the clerk, in extreme disgust, “and ask him what he means by bringing such a fellow as that.”"
"然后我的监护人把我带进他自己的房间，他一边站在那里吃午餐，吃的是装在盒子里的三明治，还有一小瓶雪利酒（他吃饭的样子就像是在欺凌那个三明治一样），同时告诉我他都为我做了哪些安排。我要到“巴纳德旅馆”去，住进小鄱凯特先生的房间里，一张给我睡的床已经送到那里去了。星期一之前我要一直和小鄱凯特先生呆在一起，星期一我要和小鄱凯特先生一起去他父亲家里拜访一下，我可以试试自己喜不喜欢那位老师。而且，他还告诉我会有多少零用钱——是一笔数目可观的零用钱——然后他打开一个抽屉，取出钱来给我，还有某些商人的名片，我要从这些商人那里订做所有的衣服，以及其他类似我需要的东西。“你的信誉很好，皮普先生，”我的监护人一面匆忙地补充能量，一面跟我说话，他那一小瓶雪利酒的味道就跟满满一桶酒的味道一样浓烈，“但是我能通过各种方式查看你的账单，要是我发现你在警察那里犯了事的话，我会把你弄出来的。当然你会犯错误，不过那可不是我的错。”","My guardian then took me into his own room, and while he lunched, standing, from a sandwich-box and a pocket flask of sherry (he seemed to bully his very sandwich as he ate it), informed me what arrangements he had made for me.I was to go to “Barnard’s Inn,” to young Mr. Pocket’s rooms, where a bed had been sent in for my accommodation; I was to remain with young Mr. Pocket until Monday; on Monday I was to go with him to his father’s house on a visit, that I might try how I liked it.Also, I was told what my allowance was to be—it was a very liberal one—and had handed to me from one of my guardian’s drawers, the cards of certain tradesmen with whom I was to deal for all kinds of clothes, and such other things as I could in reason want.“You will find your credit good, Mr. Pip,” said my guardian, whose flask of sherry smelt like a whole cask-full, as he hastily refreshed himself, “but I shall by this means be able to check your bills, and to pull you up if I find you outrunning the constable.Of course you’ll go wrong somehow, but that’s no fault of mine.”"
"听了这番鼓励的言辞，我沉思了一会儿，然后我问贾格尔斯先生我能否雇一辆马车。他说雇一辆马车很不值，这里离我要去的地方很近，如果我愿意的话，温米克可以和我一起走过去。","After I had pondered a little over this encouraging sentiment, I asked Mr. Jaggers if I could send for a coach?He said it was not worth while, I was so near my destination; Wemmick should walk round with me, if I pleased."
"这时我才知道，温米克就是在隔壁房间里的那个职员。在温米克外出的时候，有另外一个职员从楼上跑下来接替他的位置。我和我的监护人握过手之后，就和温米克一起走上大街。我们发现另外一群人在外面徘徊，但是温米克从他们中间挤出一条路来，冷淡而又坚决地说道：“我告诉你们，没有用的，他不会跟你们任何人说一个字的。”一会儿我们就摆脱了他们，继续并肩赶路。","I then found that Wemmick was the clerk in the next room.Another clerk was rung down from up-stairs to take his place while he was out, and I accompanied him into the street, after shaking hands with my guardian.We found a new set of people lingering outside, but Wemmick made a way among them by saying coolly yet decisively, “I tell you it’s no use; he won’t have a word to say to one of you;” and we soon got clear of them, and went on side by side."
"第二十一章","Chapter 21"
"一边走着，我一边观察着温米克先生，看看他在白天是什么样子。我发现他是一个喜怒不形于色的人，身材比较矮小，长了一张像方块木头似的脸，脸上的表情就像用一把不锋利的凿子刻出来的那样，而且刻得并不完美。要是材料再柔软一点，工具再顺手一点的话，那张脸上本来是可以有酒窝的，但是事实上，有的只是凹痕。那把凿子在他的鼻子上划了三四下，本来是打算试着修饰一下鼻子的，可是还没有把它们磨平就放弃了努力。从他亚麻布衫的破损程度上来看，我断定他是一个单身汉。而且他似乎还承受了失去很多亲人的痛苦，因为他戴了至少四枚服丧戒指，除此之外还有一个胸针，上面画了一名妇女和一座墓碑。墓碑上插着一枝垂柳，还放着一只骨灰瓮。我也注意到，在他的表链上挂着几个戒指和图章，似乎他非常怀念那些已经离去的朋友。他的眼睛闪闪发亮——黑色的眼睛小而锐利——还有又薄又宽、带有斑驳杂色的嘴唇。依我看来，他大约在四十到五十岁之间。","Casting my eyes on Mr. Wemmick as we went along, to see what he was like in the light of day, I found him to be a dry man, rather short in stature, with a square wooden face, whose expression seemed to have been imperfectly chipped out with a dull-edged chisel.There were some marks in it that might have been dimples, if the material had been softer and the instrument finer, but which, as it was, were only dints.The chisel had made three or four of these attempts at embellishment over his nose, but had given them up without an effort to smooth them off.I judged him to be a bachelor from the frayed condition of his linen, and he appeared to have sustained a good many bereavements; for, he wore at least four mourning rings, besides a brooch representing a lady and a weeping willow at a tomb with an urn on it.I noticed, too, that several rings and seals hung at his watch chain, as if he were quite laden with remembrances of departed friends.He had glittering eyes—small, keen, and black—and thin wide mottled lips.He had had them, to the best of my belief, from forty to fifty years."
"“那么，你从没来过伦敦？”温米克先生对我说。","“So you were never in London before?” said Mr. Wemmick to me."
"“没有。”我说。","“No,” said I."
"“我曾经也对这里感到新奇。”温米克先生说，“现在想起来真奇怪！”","“I was new here once,” said Mr. Wemmick.“Rum to think of now!”"
"“那么,你现在对这里已经很熟悉了吗？”","“You are well acquainted with it now?”"
"“哦，当然了，”温米克先生说，“我了解它的一举一动。”","“Why, yes,” said Mr. Wemmick.“I know the moves of it.”"
"“这儿是个很邪恶的地方吗？”我问道。我只是为了说一些话而已，并不是为了打探任何消息。","“Is it a very wicked place?” I asked, more for the sake of saying something than for information."
"“在伦敦，你可能会被骗、被抢或者被谋杀。但是在任何地方都有很多人会对你干出这种事的。”","“You may get cheated, robbed, and murdered, in London.But there are plenty of people anywhere, who’ll do that for you.”"
"“要是你和他们之间有仇的话。”为了缓和一下气氛，我说道。","“If there is bad blood between you and them,” said I, to soften it off a little."
"“哦！我不知道有什么仇恨。”温米克先生回答道，“并没有那么多的仇恨存在。他们干这些事，是因为他们能从中获利。”","“Oh! I don’t know about bad blood,” returned Mr. Wemmick; “there’s not much bad blood about.They’ll do it, if there’s anything to be got by it.”"
"“那样会让情况更糟糕了。”","“That makes it worse.”"
"“你是这样认为的吗？”温米克先生回答道，“我觉得，这些事情其实都差不多。”","“You think so?” returned Mr. Wemmick.“Much about the same, I should say.”"
"他把帽子戴在后脑勺，眼睛正视前方。他沉默寡言地走着，仿佛大街上没有什么事能吸引他的注意力。他的嘴就像邮箱的投递口，露出一副机械的笑容。直到我们到了霍尔本山山顶，我才发现那种笑容只是一副机械的表情而已，他根本没有在笑。","He wore his hat on the back of his head, and looked straight before him: walking in a self-contained way as if there were nothing in the streets to claim his attention.His mouth was such a postoffice of a mouth that he had a mechanical appearance of smiling.We had got to the top of Holborn Hill before I knew that it was merely a mechanical appearance, and that he was not smiling at all."
"“你知道马修·鄱凯特先生住在哪里吗？”我问温米克先生。","“Do you know where Mr. Matthew Pocket lives?” I asked Mr. Wemmick."
"“知道。”他说着，朝那个方向点了点头，“在哈默史密斯，伦敦西区。”","“Yes,” said he, nodding in the direction.“At Hammersmith, west of London.”"
"“远吗？”","“Is that far?”"
"“嗯！大概五英里。”","“Well!Say five miles.”"
"“你认识他吗？”","“Do you know him?”"
"“啊，你真是一个十足的审问官啊！”温米克先生说着，以赞许的神态看着我，“是的，我认识他。我认识他！”","“Why, you’re a regular cross-examiner!” said Mr. Wemmick, looking at me with an approving air.“Yes, I know him.I know him!”"
"他说这些话的时候带着一种容忍和轻视的意味，那样会让我很沮丧。之后我一直从侧面看着他的脸，努力寻找一丝鼓励的讯息，突然他说：“到了，我们到巴纳德旅馆了。”我的沮丧情绪并没有因为他的这句话而减轻，因为我本以为，这是由巴纳德先生所拥有的一个旅馆，与之相比我们镇上的“蓝野猪”饭店就只不过是一个小酒馆罢了。然而，我现在发现，巴纳德只是一个没有实体的灵魂，或者说是虚构出来的作品，他的旅馆只不过是将挤在肮脏角落里的几幢破旧楼房邋遢地拼凑在一起，就像单身汉的俱乐部那样。","There was an air of toleration or depreciation about his utterance of these words, that rather depressed me; and I was still looking sideways at his block of a face in search of any encouraging note to the text, when he said here we were at Barnard’s Inn.My depression was not alleviated by the announcement, for, I had supposed that establishment to be an hotel kept by Mr. Barnard, to which the Blue Boar in our town was a mere public-house.Whereas I now found Barnard to be a disembodied spirit, or a fiction, and his inn the dingiest collection of shabby buildings ever squeezed together in a rank corner as a club for Tom-cats."
"我们从便门走进了这个避难所，然后一条走廊将我们带入一个压抑而狭小的四方形广场，那儿在我看起来就像一个平坦的墓地。我觉得，这里有我所见过的最阴沉的树、最阴沉的麻雀、最阴沉的猫、和最阴沉的房子了（差不多有六间左右）。我觉得，那些将房子分隔成套间的窗户都快坏了，还有破旧的窗帘、残废的花盆、打碎的玻璃，满眼看到的都是布满灰尘的衰败景象，充斥着得过且过的悲凉气氛。空房间的招租广告对我怒目而视，仿佛从来没有新来的可怜人到过这里。而现有的住客正在实施慢性自杀，他们被埋在砂砾之下的可怕景象让巴纳德灵魂中的复仇之心慢慢得到平复。肮脏、哀恸的煤灰和烟幕装饰着这部被遗弃的巴纳德的作品。它顶上还散落着灰烬，就像一个垃圾坑一样正经历着苦行和羞辱。目前这里就是我的目光所及之处，不管是干枯还是湿腐，或是那些被遗忘的屋顶和地窖中沉寂的腐朽——腐烂的老鼠、耗子、小虫和旁边的赛马棚——这些都在以模糊的讯息与我的嗅觉交流，呻吟着说：“试一下巴纳德的混合大餐。”","We entered this haven through a wicket-gate, and were disgorged by an introductory passage into a melancholy little square that looked to me like a flat burying-ground.I thought it had the most dismal trees in it, and the most dismal sparrows, and the most dismal cats, and the most dismal houses (in number half a dozen or so), that I had ever seen.I thought the windows of the sets of chambers into which those houses were divided, were in every stage of dilapidated blind and curtain, crippled flower-pot, cracked glass, dusty decay, and miserable makeshift; while To Let To Let To Let, glared at me from empty rooms, as if no new wretches ever came there, and the vengeance of the soul of Barnard were being slowly appeased by the gradual suicide of the present occupants and their unholy interment under the gravel.A frouzy mourning of soot and smoke attired this forlorn creation of Barnard, and it had strewn ashes on its head, and was undergoing penance and humiliation as a mere dust-hole.Thus far my sense of sight; while dry rot and wet rot and all the silent rots that rot in neglected roof and cellar—rot of rat and mouse and bug and coaching-stables near at hand besides—addressed themselves faintly to my sense of smell, and moaned, “Try Barnard’s Mixture.”"
"实现我远大前程的第一步竟然如此不尽如人意，于是我沮丧地看着温米克先生。“啊！”他理解错了我的意思，说道，“这种遁世生活让你想起你的家乡了吧。我也是。”","So imperfect was this realization of the first of my great expectations, that I looked in dismay at Mr. Wemmick.“Ah!” said he, mistaking me; “the retirement reminds you of the country.So it does me.”"
"他把我带到一个角落，领着我上了一段楼梯——在我看来，这个楼梯会慢慢断裂成锯屑，所以到了那个时候的某一天，楼上的住客要是向门外望去，就会发现他们没办法下楼了——我们到了顶楼的一个套间。门上漆着“小鄱凯特先生”几个字，信箱上面贴着一张标签，上面写着“片刻即回”。","He led me into a corner and conducted me up a flight of stairs—which appeared to me to be slowly collapsing into sawdust, so that one of those days the upper lodgers would look out at their doors and find themselves without the means of coming down—to a set of chambers on the top floor.MR. POCKET, JUN., was painted on the door, and there was a label on the letter-box, “Return shortly.”"
"“他肯定没想到你会这么快就到了。”温米克先生解释道，“你不再需要我了吧？”","“He hardly thought you’d come so soon,” Mr. Wemmick explained.“You don’t want me any more?”"
"“不需要了，谢谢。”我说。","“No, thank you,” said I."
"“由于我保管着现金，”温米克先生说，“我们会经常见面的。再见。”","“As I keep the cash,” Mr. Wemmick observed, “we shall most likely meet pretty often.Good day.”"
"“再见。”","“Good day.”"
"我伸出手去，温米克先生一开始看着我的手，还以为我想要什么东西。之后他看看我，纠正了自己，说道：","I put out my hand, and Mr. Wemmick at first looked at it as if he thought I wanted something.Then he looked at me, and said, correcting himself,"
"“那是一定的！是的。你有握手的习惯吗？”","“To be sure!Yes.You’re in the habit of shaking hands?”"
"我感到非常疑惑，想着这种习惯在伦敦一定已经过时了，但是还是作出了肯定的回答。","I was rather confused, thinking it must be out of the London fashion, but said yes."
"“我不太习惯这个！”温米克先生说：“除非是在最后一次道别的时候。很高兴能认识你。再见！”","“I have got so out of it!” said Mr. Wemmick—“except at last.Very glad, I’m sure, to make your acquaintance.Good day!”"
"我们握了手之后他就走了。我打开了楼梯的窗户，但差一点砍掉自己的脑袋，因为绳索已经腐烂了，窗户就像铡刀一样落了下来。幸好它落得太快，我还没来得及把我的头伸出窗外。经过这次死里逃生之后，我就满足于透过结满污垢的窗户模糊地看一眼这个旅馆的全貌了。我寂寞地站在那里，看着窗外，对我自己说，伦敦有些名过其实了。","When we had shaken hands and he was gone, I opened the staircase window and had nearly beheaded myself, for, the lines had rotted away, and it came down like the guillotine.Happily it was so quick that I had not put my head out.After this escape, I was content to take a foggy view of the Inn through the window’s encrusting dirt, and to stand dolefully looking out, saying to myself that London was decidedly overrated."
"小鄱凯特先生所说的“片刻”和我所想的有些不太一样，我看着窗外看了有半个小时，还用手指在窗格的灰尘上写了好多个自己的名字。就在我几乎要发狂的时候，我才听到楼梯上传来了脚步声。我的眼前渐渐出现了帽子、头、围巾、马甲、裤子还有靴子，之后一个和我社会地位差不多的人站在了我的面前。他的两只手臂下各夹了一个纸袋，一只手里拿着一篮子草莓，累得上气不接下气。","Mr. Pocket, Junior’s, idea of Shortly was not mine, for I had nearly maddened myself with looking out for half an hour, and had written my name with my finger several times in the dirt of every pane in the window, before I heard footsteps on the stairs.Gradually there arose before me the hat, head, neckcloth, waistcoat, trousers, boots, of a member of society of about my own standing.He had a paper-bag under each arm and a pottle of strawberries in one hand, and was out of breath."
"“皮普先生？”他说。","“Mr. Pip?” said he. "
"“鄱凯特先生？”我说。","“Mr. Pocket?” said I."
"“我的天！”他喊道，“我感到非常抱歉。但是我知道，中午的时候从你的老家会发出一班长途马车，我还以为你会坐那趟车来呢。事实上，我也是为了你才外出的——倒不是我找来的借口——因为我想，你既然从乡下过来，可能会想在饭后吃一点水果，所以我去了科芬园市场买了一些新鲜的回来。”","“Dear me!” he exclaimed.“I am extremely sorry; but I knew there was a coach from your part of the country at midday, and I thought you would come by that one.The fact is, I have been out on your account—not that that is any excuse—for I thought, coming from the country, you might like a little fruit after dinner, and I went to Covent Garden Market to get it good.”"
"出于某种原因，我觉得自己的眼睛都快掉出来了。我结结巴巴地感谢了他的关心，开始觉得这一切都是一场梦。","For a reason that I had, I felt as if my eyes would start out of my head.I acknowledged his attention incoherently, and began to think this was a dream."
"“我的天！”小鄱凯特先生说，“门真紧！”","“Dear me!” said Mr. Pocket, Junior. “This door sticks so!”"
"他将纸袋夹在胳膊下面，同时和门较着劲，那些水果很快就会变成果酱的，所以我请求他允许我拿着那些水果。他愉快地笑了一笑，放开了水果，之后又和门展开了一场战斗，就好像那扇门是头野兽一样。最后那扇门突然放弃了战斗，他就摇摇晃晃向后面退过来，于是站在后面的我就向对面的门退了几步，然后我们都笑了。但是我仍旧感到很吃惊，好像眼珠都要掉下来似的，感觉自己肯定是在做梦。","As he was fast making jam of his fruit by wrestling with the door while the paper-bags were under his arms, I begged him to allow me to hold them.He relinquished them with an agreeable smile, and combated with the door as if it were a wild beast.It yielded so suddenly at last, that he staggered back upon me, and I staggered back upon the opposite door, and we both laughed.But still I felt as if my eyes must start out of my head, and as if this must be a dream."
"“请进，”小鄱凯特特先生说，“请允许我来带路。我这里空荡荡的，但是我希望你能将就一下，忍到星期一。我父亲觉得你明天和我呆在一起会比和他呆在一起要舒服一点，你也许想在伦敦到处走走。我肯定会很高兴带你游览伦敦的。至于我们的饭菜，我希望你不会觉得很差，因为饭菜都是由我们这里的咖啡厅供应的，还有（我需要补充的是）根据贾格尔斯先生的指示，这些是要你出钱的。至于我们的旅馆，绝对称不上是富丽堂皇，因为我还要维持自己的生计，我父亲也没有给我留下任何东西，而且即使他留下了，我也不愿意接受的。这是我们的起居室——只有这些椅子、桌子、地毯之类的，你看，这些都能从家里省出来一些。这些桌布、勺子和调味瓶也不能算在我的头上，因为这些都是从咖啡馆里为你拿来的。这是我的小卧室，有股霉味，但是巴纳德旅馆里就是这种发霉的味道。这是你的卧室，家具是临时租来的，但是我相信这些已经能应付了。如果你还需要什么，我会去拿给你的。这些房间都很僻静，我们会独自住在这里，但是我敢说，我们不会打架的。但是，天啊，不好意思，让你一直拿着水果。请让我接过这些袋子。我真是很惭愧。”","“Pray come in,” said Mr. Pocket, Junior.“Allow me to lead the way.I am rather bare here, but I hope you’ll be able to make out tolerably well till Monday.My father thought you would get on more agreeably through tomorrow with me than with him, and might like to take a walk about London.I am sure I shall be very happy to show London to you.As to our table, you won’t find that bad, I hope, for it will be supplied from our coffee-house here, and (it is only right I should add) at your expense, such being Mr. Jaggers’ directions.As to our lodging, it’s not by any means splendid, because I have my own bread to earn, and my father hasn’t anything to give me, and I shouldn’t be willing to take it, if he had.This is our sitting-room—just such chairs and tables and carpet and so forth, you see, as they could spare from home.You mustn’t give me credit for the tablecloth and spoons and castors, because they come for you from the coffee-house.This is my little bedroom; rather musty, but Barnard’s is musty.This is your bed-room; the furniture’s hired for the occasion, but I trust it will answer the purpose; if you should want anything, I’ll go and fetch it.The chambers are retired, and we shall be alone together, but we shan’t fight, I dare say.But, dear me, I beg your pardon, you’re holding the fruit all this time.Pray let me take these bags from you.I am quite ashamed.”"
"就在我站在小鄱凯特先生对面给他一只接一只地递袋子的时候，我看见他眼里发出吃惊的神情，我知道我的眼神里也有同样的神情，他退了一步，说：","As I stood opposite to Mr. Pocket, Junior, delivering him the bags, One, Two, I saw the startling appearance come into his own eyes that I knew to be in mine, and he said, falling back:"
"“上帝保佑，你是那个到处乱走的小男孩吗？”","“Lord bless me, you’re the prowling boy!”"
"“你是，”我说，“那个脸色苍白的年轻绅士！”","“And you,” said I, “are the pale young gentleman!”"
"第二十二章","Chapter 22"
"这个脸色苍白的年轻绅士和我站在巴纳德旅馆里，互相凝视着对方，直到我们俩都大笑了起来。“居然是你！”他说。“居然是你！”我说。之后我们又重新看着对方，又一次笑了起来。“很好！”这位脸色苍白的年轻绅士说着，愉快地伸出了手，“我希望现在一切都结束了，要是你原谅我曾经那样打你的话，那么你真是太宽宏大量了。”","The pale young gentleman and I stood contemplating one another in Barnard’s Inn, until we both burst out laughing.“The idea of its being you!” said he.“The idea of its being you!” said I. And then we contemplated one another afresh, and laughed again.“Well!” said the pale young gentleman, reaching out his hand good-humoredly, “it’s all over now, I hope, and it will be magnanimous in you if you’ll forgive me for having knocked you about so.”"
"从他的讲话中可以得知，赫伯特·鄱凯特先生（赫伯特就是这个脸色苍白的年轻绅士的名字）还是没有分清楚他的打架动机和打架结果。但是我作出了谦和的回答，然后我们热情地握了手。","I derived from this speech that Mr. Herbert Pocket (for Herbert was the pale young gentleman’s name) still rather confounded his intention with his execution.But I made a modest reply, and we shook hands warmly."
"“你那个时候还没有发大财吧？”赫伯特·鄱凯特说。","“You hadn’t come into your good fortune at that time?” said Herbert Pocket. "
"“没有。”我说。","“No,” said I."
"“嗯。”他默许道，“我听说这是最近才发生的事。我那时也希望自己能发大财呢。”","“No,” he acquiesced: “I heard it had happened very lately.I was rather on the look-out for good-fortune then.”"
"“是吗？”","“Indeed?”"
"“是的。郝维仙小姐也派人叫我去了，看看她是否能看上我。但是她没要我——无论如何，她都没有要我。”","“Yes.Miss Havisham had sent for me, to see if she could take a fancy to me.But she couldn’t—at all events, she didn’t.”"
"我想，我应该礼貌性地表示我对此感到很惊讶。","I thought it polite to remark that I was surprised to hear that."
"“没有品位，”赫伯特笑着说，“但这是事实。是的，她派人叫我去试一下。要是那次尝试成功了的话，我想我就是那个幸运儿，多半都和埃斯特拉那个什么了。”","“Bad taste,” said Herbert, laughing, “but a fact.Yes, she had sent for me on a trial visit, and if I had come out of it successfully, I suppose I should have been provided for; perhaps I should have been what-you-may-called it to Estella.”"
"“‘那个什么’是什么？”我突然严肃起来，问他。","“What’s that?” I asked, with sudden gravity."
"我们说话的时候他正把水果摆上果盘，这个动作分散了他的注意力，让他没用对词。“订婚，”他解释道，手里还在忙着摆水果。“定下婚约，确定联姻。差不多是这个意思。就是这一类的说法吧。”","He was arranging his fruit in plates while we talked, which divided his attention, and was the cause of his having made this lapse of a word.“Affianced,” he explained, still busy with the fruit.“Betrothed.Engaged.What’s-his-named.Any word of that sort.”"
"“你怎么能忍受得了这种失望之情呢？”我问道。","“How did you bear your disappointment?” I asked. "
"“唉！”他说，“我才不在乎呢。她是个凶悍的人。”","“Pooh!” said he, “I didn’t care much for it.She’s a Tartar.”"
"“郝维仙小姐？”","“Miss Havisham?”"
"“我不能说她不是，但是我指的是埃斯特拉。那个女孩子极度刻薄、傲慢、喜怒无常，而且还是郝维仙小姐带大的。郝维仙小姐就是要让她向所有男人复仇。”","“I don’t say no to that, but I meant Estella.That girl’s hard and haughty and capricious to the last degree, and has been brought up by Miss Havisham to wreak revenge on all the male sex.”"
"“她和郝维仙小姐是什么关系呢？”","“What relation is she to Miss Havisham?”"
"“没关系，”他说，“只是收养的孩子。”","“None,” said he.“Only adopted.”"
"“那么为什么她要向所有男人复仇呢？有什么仇恨呢？”","“Why should she wreak revenge on all the male sex?What revenge?”"
"“天啊，皮普先生！”他说，“你还不知道吗？”","“Lord, Mr. Pip!” said he.“Don’t you know?”"
"“不知道。”我说。","“No,” said I."
"“我的天啊！这话说起来就长了，我们留到晚饭时间再说吧。现在请允许我问你一个问题。你那天是怎么到那里去的？”","“Dear me!It’s quite a story, and shall be saved till dinner-time.And now let me take the liberty of asking you a question.How did you come there, that day?”"
"我告诉了他事情的经过，而他一直都认真地听着，之后又哈哈大笑起来，还问我后来痛不痛。我并没有问他痛不痛，因为我确信答案绝对是肯定的。","I told him, and he was attentive until I had finished, and then burst out laughing again, and asked me if I was sore afterwards?I didn’t ask him if he was, for my conviction on that point was perfectly established."
"“据我了解，贾格尔斯先生是你的监护人？”他继续说道。","“Mr. Jaggers is your guardian, I understand?” he went on. "
"“是的。”","“Yes.”"
"“你知道他是郝维仙小姐生意上的伙伴兼法律顾问，没人比他更能得到她的信任吗？”","“You know he is Miss Havisham’s man of business and solicitor, and has her confidence when nobody else has?”"
"（我感觉）这个问题把我置于一种很危险的处境。在回答他的问题的时候我显得局促不安，但我并没有掩饰这种不安。我告诉他说，就在我们打架的那一天，我在郝维仙小姐家见过贾格尔斯先生，之外就从未在那里见过他，而且我相信他绝没有想起来他曾经在那里见过我。","This was bringing me (I felt) towards dangerous ground.I answered with a constraint I made no attempt to disguise, that I had seen Mr. Jaggers in Miss Havisham’s house on the very day of our combat, but never at any other time, and that I believed he had no recollection of having ever seen me there."
"“他非常愿意帮忙，建议我的父亲去做你的导师，而且他还来拜访过我的父亲，提议此事呢。他肯定是从郝维仙小姐那里听说我父亲的。我父亲和郝维仙小姐是表亲，但这种关系并不意味着他们之间有亲近的往来，因为他不懂得溜须拍马、不会故意讨好她。”","“He was so obliging as to suggest my father for your tutor, and he called on my father to propose it.Of course he knew about my father from his connexion with Miss Havisham.My father is Miss Havisham’s cousin; not that that implies familiar intercourse between them, for he is a bad courtier and will not propitiate her.”"
"赫伯特·鄱凯特是一个率直、好相处的人,非常有魅力。在那之前以及打那以后，我都没有见过像他这样的人，每幅表情、每句言语都那么强烈地表达出他是个天生光明磊落的人。他整体上带有一种乐观向上的特质，但是同时，有一个声音在我耳边说，他绝不会非常成功或者发大财的。我不知道自己为什么会有这样的感觉。在我第一眼见到他，还没有一起坐下来吃饭之前，我就沉浸于这种想法之中了，然而我却不知道这样的想法是怎么得来的。","Herbert Pocket had a frank and easy way with him that was very taking.I had never seen any one then, and I have never seen any one since, who more strongly expressed to me, in every look and tone, a natural incapacity to do anything secret and mean.There was something wonderfully hopeful about his general air, and something that at the same time whispered to me he would never be very successful or rich.I don’t know how this was.I became imbued with the notion on that first occasion before we sat down to dinner, but I cannot define by what means."
"那时，他还是一个脸色苍白的年轻绅士，在他热情活泼的外表之下，有着某种被击败的衰弱无力，那看起来可不是在说明他天生强健。他长得并不帅气，但是却非常和蔼可亲、神采飞扬，这种特质要比长得帅气好多了。他的身形显得有些笨拙，就像我的拳头毫无顾忌地打了他的那些日子一样，但是他的身段看起来好像会永远轻盈而且年轻。特拉布先生裁剪的作品穿在我身上更高雅还是穿在他身上更高雅，这是个问题。但是我意识到，他穿着他那件相当破旧的衣服比我穿着我的新衣服要好看多了。","He was still a pale young gentleman, and had a certain conquered languor about him in the midst of his spirits and briskness, that did not seem indicative of natural strength.He had not a handsome face, but it was better than handsome: being extremely amiable and cheerful.His figure was a little ungainly, as in the days when my knuckles had taken such liberties with it, but it looked as if it would always be light and young.Whether Mr. Trabb’s local work would have sat more gracefully on him than on me, may be a question; but I am conscious that he carried off his rather old clothes, much better than I carried off my new suit."
"由于他非常健谈，我感觉要是我这边过于保守的话会非常不礼貌，而且和我们的年龄也极不相称。于是我把我的小故事告诉了他，还强调说我被禁止询问谁是我的赞助人。我进一步提到我是在乡下长大，本来要当一名铁匠的，所以对于礼数方面所知甚少，要是他能在我不知所措或者捅出娄子的时候指点一下的话，我将不胜感激。","As he was so communicative, I felt that reserve on my part would be a bad return unsuited to our years.I therefore told him my small story, and laid stress on my being forbidden to inquire who my benefactor was.I further mentioned that as I had been brought up a blacksmith in a country place, and knew very little of the ways of politeness, I would take it as a great kindness in him if he would give me a hint whenever he saw me at a loss or going wrong."
"“我很荣幸，”他说，“但我敢说，你需要我指点的机会非常少。我敢说，我们会经常在一起，我会消除我们之间一切不必要的约束。那么，你能否从现在开始就喊我的教名‘赫伯特’呢？”","“With pleasure,” said he, “though I venture to prophesy that you’ll want very few hints.I dare say we shall be often together, and I should like to banish any needless restraint between us.Will you do me the favor to begin at once to call me by my Christian name, Herbert?”"
"我向他表示了感谢，并且答应了他的要求。作为交换，我告诉他我的教名是菲利普。","I thanked him, and said I would.I informed him in exchange that my Christian name was Philip."
"“我不喜欢‘菲利普’这个名字，”他笑着说，“因为它听起来就像单词拼写课本上的寓言小子一样，他因为太懒惰而掉进了池塘，或者太胖而睁不开眼睛，或者是太贪婪而把蛋糕锁起来，直到都喂了老鼠，又或者是下定决心去捅鸟窝，结果被住在附近的熊吃掉了。我告诉你我喜欢什么。我们俩太和谐了，而且你曾经是个铁匠——你不介意吧？”","“I don’t take to Philip,” said he, smiling, “for it sounds like a moral boy out of the spelling-book, who was so lazy that he fell into a pond, or so fat that he couldn’t see out of his eyes, or so avaricious that he locked up his cake till the mice ate it, or so determined to go a bird’s-nesting that he got himself eaten by bears who lived handy in the neighborhood.I tell you what I should like.We are so harmonious, and you have been a blacksmith—would you mind it?”"
"“你说的任何话我都不会介意的，”我回答道，“但是我没明白你的意思。”","“I shouldn’t mind anything that you propose,” I answered, “but I don’t understand you.”"
"“你介意我叫你汉德尔吗？汉德尔写过一首迷人的曲子，叫做《和谐的铁匠》。”","“Would you mind Handel for a familiar name?There’s a charming piece of music by Handel, called the Harmonious Blacksmith.”"
"“我非常喜欢这个名字。”","“I should like it very much.”"
"“那么，我亲爱的汉德尔，”他说着，身后的门被打开了，他转过身去，“这是晚餐，我必须请你坐在上座，因为这顿晚餐是为你准备的。”","“Then, my dear Handel,” said he, turning round as the door opened, “here is the dinner, and I must beg of you to take the top of the table, because the dinner is of your providing.”"
"这次我没有听他的，所以他坐了上座，而我就坐在他对面。这是美味的小型晚餐——对于我来说简直是市长阁下的盛宴——而且这顿在不受约束的情况下享用的晚餐又有了另一种意味，就是身边没有长辈，而且身处伦敦。同时激起我的兴趣的还有这宴会所带有的吉普赛风格，而用彭波契克先生的话来说，这晚餐简直是太奢侈了——全部由咖啡厅供应——起居室周围区域的条件就相对较差，而且其用途多变。这种环境让服务生不得不漫不经心地把桌布铺在地上（而他却因此绊倒），把融化了的黄油放在扶手椅上，把面包放在书架上，把奶酪放在煤桶里，还把煮熟了的鸡肉放在我旁边屋子的床上——我在晚上睡觉的时候发现很多欧芹和黄油都结在我的床上了。所有这一切令我的晚餐吃得非常愉快，尤其是在那个服务生没有在那里盯着我的时候，我真是开心到了极点。","This I would not hear of, so he took the top, and I faced him.It was a nice little dinner—seemed to me then, a very Lord Mayor’s Feast—and it acquired additional relish from being eaten under those independent circumstances, with no old people by, and with London all around us.This again was heightened by a certain gipsy character that set the banquet off; for, while the table was, as Mr. Pumblechook might have said, the lap of luxury—being entirely furnished forth from the coffee-house—the circumjacent region of sitting-room was of a comparatively pastureless and shifty character: imposing on the waiter the wandering habits of putting the covers on the floor (where he fell over them), the melted butter in the armchair, the bread on the bookshelves, the cheese in the coalscuttle, and the boiled fowl into my bed in the next room—where I found much of its parsley and butter in a state of congelation when I retired for the night.All this made the feast delightful, and when the waiter was not there to watch me, my pleasure was without alloy."
"我们吃了一会儿之后，我就提醒赫伯特说，他答应给我讲郝维仙小姐的故事。","We had made some progress in the dinner, when I reminded Herbert of his promise to tell me about Miss Havisham."
"“是的，”他回答道，“我立刻就开始说。让我先引入话题，汉德尔，提到伦敦，人们通常不会将刀直接放入嘴里——以免意外发生——因此叉子就派上了用场，但如非必要，也不用太深入口中。这一点其实不值一提，只是别人都这样做，那么我们最好也这样做。还有，勺子一般不能过肩，要拿得低一点。这样有两个好处。一来你能更方便地够到嘴巴（说到底就是要送到嘴里的），二来你的右肘就不必举得像开口的牡蛎一样了。”","“True,” he replied.“I’ll redeem it at once.Let me introduce the topic, Handel, by mentioning that in London it is not the custom to put the knife in the mouth—for fear of accidents—and that while the fork is reserved for that use, it is not put further in than necessary.It is scarcely worth mentioning, only it’s as well to do as other people do.Also, the spoon is not generally used over-hand, but under.This has two advantages.You get at your mouth better (which after all is the object), and you save a good deal of the attitude of opening oysters, on the part of the right elbow.”"
"他以如此生动的形式向我提出了这些友好的建议，我们俩都笑了，而且我都没有脸红。","He offered these friendly suggestions in such a lively way, that we both laughed and I scarcely blushed."
"“现在，”他继续说，“说到郝维仙小姐。你一定知道，郝维仙小姐是一个被宠坏了的孩子。她还在襁褓中的时候母亲就去世了，她父亲对她则是有求必应。她的父亲是你们那里的一个乡绅，是个啤酒酿造商。我不知道做啤酒酿造商有什么好的，但是毋庸置疑的是，你要是个烤面包的就不太可能进入上流社会，而你要是酿啤酒的，就能进入你从未踏入的上流社会。这种事天天都在发生。”","“Now,” he pursued, “concerning Miss Havisham.Miss Havisham, you must know, was a spoilt child.Her mother died when she was a baby, and her father denied her nothing.Her father was a country gentleman down in your part of the world, and was a brewer.I don’t know why it should be a crack thing to be a brewer; but it is indisputable that while you cannot possibly be genteel and bake, you may be as genteel as never was and brew.You see it every day.”"
"“然而，一位绅士是不会开酒吧的，不是吗？”我说。","“Yet a gentleman may not keep a public-house; may he?” said I. "
"“任何情况下都不能，”赫伯特回答说，“但是一间酒吧却能造就一位绅士。嗯！郝维仙先生非常富有，而且很骄傲。他的女儿也是如此。”","“Not on any account,” returned Herbert; “but a public-house may keep a gentleman.Well! Mr. Havisham was very rich and very proud.So was his daughter.”"
"“郝维仙小姐是他的独生女吗？”我冒昧问道。","“Miss Havisham was an only child?” I hazarded."
"“先停一下，我就要说到那里了。不是，她不是独生女，她有一个同父异母的弟弟。她的父亲又偷偷地结了婚——我想就是与他的厨师。”","“Stop a moment, I am coming to that.No, she was not an only child; she had a half-brother.Her father privately married again—his cook, I rather think.”"
"“我还以为他很骄傲呢。”我说。","“I thought he was proud,” said I."
"“我亲爱的汉德尔，他的确很骄傲。他偷偷地娶了他的第二位夫人，就是因为他很骄傲。不久之后，她就去世了。在她去世之后，我想他首先把他做的事告诉了他的女儿，之后这儿子才成为家庭的一员，住进了你熟悉的那座房子里。当这个儿子成年之后，他变得非常放纵、奢侈、而且不孝——完全就是一个恶棍。最后他的父亲剥夺了他的继承权，但是在临死之时心又软了下来，给他留了丰厚的财产，尽管远不能和郝维仙小姐的相比——再喝一杯吧，同时原谅我多说一句，在社交场合，不用太死板、太刻意地为了喝光杯子里的酒，就把杯子倒过来，将杯沿贴着鼻子。”","“My good Handel, so he was.He married his second wife privately, because he was proud, and in course of time she died.When she was dead, I apprehend he first told his daughter what he had done, and then the son became a part of the family, residing in the house you are acquainted with.As the son grew a young man, he turned out riotous, extravagant, undutiful—altogether bad.At last his father disinherited him; but he softened when he was dying, and left him well off, though not nearly so well off as Miss Havisham.—Take another glass of wine, and excuse my mentioning that society as a body does not expect one to be so strictly conscientious in emptying one’s glass, as to turn it bottom upwards with the rim on one’s nose.”"
"我听他叙述时太过认真了，就犯了这样的错误。我向他表示感谢，也道了歉。他说：“没关系”，然后又继续说下去，","I had been doing this, in an excess of attention to his recital.I thanked him, and apologized.He said, “Not at all,” and resumed."
"“郝维仙小姐现在是位女继承人了，你可以想象她就被当成是一个很好的结婚对象了。她同父异母的弟弟如今也有钱了，但是他因为欠债和新的疯狂行为，又把钱挥霍光了。他们两人之间的矛盾比他和他父亲之间的矛盾还要激烈。他对她存有很深而且致命的仇恨，他觉得是因为她的影响才让父亲对他如此恼火的。现在，我要说到故事最悲惨的一段了——只是打断一下，我亲爱的汉德尔，餐巾是不能伸进玻璃杯的。”","“Miss Havisham was now an heiress, and you may suppose was looked after as a great match.Her half-brother had now ample means again, but what with debts and what with new madness wasted them most fearfully again.There were stronger differences between him and her, than there had been between him and his father, and it is suspected that he cherished a deep and mortal grudge against her, as having influenced the father’s anger.Now, I come to the cruel part of the story—merely breaking off, my dear Handel, to remark that a dinner-napkin will not go into a tumbler.”"
"我为什么要把我的餐巾塞到玻璃杯里呢，我完全不知道。我只知道，我发现自己毫无理由却锲而不舍地使劲把餐巾往杯子里塞。我又一次向他道谢和致歉，而他也又一次愉快地说：“没有关系，真的！”之后又继续讲了起来，","Why I was trying to pack mine into my tumbler, I am wholly unable to say.I only know that I found myself, with a perseverance worthy of a much better cause, making the most strenuous exertions to compress it within those limits.Again I thanked him and apologized, and again he said in the cheerfullest manner, “Not at all, I am sure!” and resumed."
"“于是出现了一种场景——比如说在赛马场，或者是公共舞会，又或者是随便什么地方——有一个男人开始向郝维仙小姐示爱。我从来没有见过他，因为这件事发生在二十五年前（那时你和我都没有出世呢，汉德尔），但是我听我父亲提起过，他是一个流于表面的人，而且做事都带有强烈的目的性。然而，我父亲一口咬定，要不是由于无知与偏见，他就不会被错当成一位绅士，因为他笃信的原则之一就是，从世界存在以来+B185，一个人要是没有真正绅士之内涵，则不会表现出真正绅士的举止风度。他说，没有清漆是能盖得住木头的纹路的，清漆涂得越多，纹路则越显清晰。唉！那个人对郝维仙小姐紧追不舍，而且声称他会忠诚于她。我相信在那之前她都没有表露过她的情感。但是到了那时，她所有的情感肯定都释放了出来，她对他的爱充满了激情。毋庸置疑的是，她已经完全被他征服了。他以一整套的手段欺骗了她的感情，从她那里得到了一大笔钱，而且他还劝她以极高的价格买下了她弟弟在酿酒厂的股份（他父亲给他留下的也没有多少了），而说服她的理由就是，在他成为她的丈夫之后，他必须全权掌管这个厂子。你的监护人在那时候还没有成为郝维仙小姐的法律顾问，而且她也太傲慢、太沉浸于恋爱之中了，不愿接受任何人的建议。她的亲戚都是既穷困又诡计多端的人，除了我的父亲，他很穷，但是既不趋炎附势，也不妒忌他人。作为他们中间唯一一个有独立思想的人，他告诫她，她为这个男人做的事太多了，而且还毫无保留地将她自己置于他的掌控之中。当着那个男人的面，她第一时间就恼火地将我父亲从家里赶了出去，自那之后，我父亲就再也没见过她。”","“There appeared upon the scene—say at the races, or the public balls, or anywhere else you like—a certain man, who made love to Miss Havisham.I never saw him, for this happened five-and-twenty years ago (before you and I were, Handel), but I have heard my father mention that he was a showy-man, and the kind of man for the purpose.But that he was not to be, without ignorance or prejudice, mistaken for a gentleman, my father most strongly asseverates; because it is a principle of his that no man who was not a true gentleman at heart, ever was, since the world began, a true gentleman in manner.He says, no varnish can hide the grain of the wood; and that the more varnish you put on, the more the grain will express itself.Well!This man pursued Miss Havisham closely, and professed to be devoted to her.I believe she had not shown much susceptibility up to that time; but all the susceptibility she possessed, certainly came out then, and she passionately loved him.There is no doubt that she perfectly idolized him.He practiced on her affection in that systematic way, that he got great sums of money from her, and he induced her to buy her brother out of a share in the brewery (which had been weakly left him by his father) at an immense price, on the plea that when he was her husband he must hold and manage it all.Your guardian was not at that time in Miss Havisham’s councils, and she was too haughty and too much in love, to be advised by any one.Her relations were poor and scheming, with the exception of my father; he was poor enough, but not time-serving or jealous.The only independent one among them, he warned her that she was doing too much for this man, and was placing herself too unreservedly in his power.She took the first opportunity of angrily ordering my father out of the house, in his presence, and my father has never seen her since.”"
"我想起来她曾经说过：“当我死后躺在那张桌子上时，马修最终还是会来看我的。”于是我问赫伯特，他的父亲对她的厌恶情绪是不是如此的根深蒂固？","I thought of her having said, “Matthew will come and see me at last when I am laid dead upon that table;” and I asked Herbert whether his father was so inveterate against her?"
"“并不是的，”他说，“但是她当着她未婚夫的面指责了他，说他希望通过讨好她为自己谋利，可是却失败了，所以就恼羞成怒、口出狂言。要是他现在去拜访她，那么在她眼里——甚至在他自己看来——那指责就是真的了。回到这个男人身上，把话说完。结婚日期都定好了，结婚礼服也买了，蜜月旅行也计划好了，婚宴客人也邀请了。这一天终于到来了，但是新郎却不见了。他给她留下了一封信——”","“It’s not that,” said he, “but she charged him, in the presence of her intended husband, with being disappointed in the hope of fawning upon her for his own advancement, and, if he were to go to her now, it would look true—even to him—and even to her.To return to the man and make an end of him.The marriage day was fixed, the wedding dresses were bought, the wedding tour was planned out, the wedding guests were invited.The day came, but not the bridegroom.He wrote her a letter—”"
"“这封信，”我插了一句，“就是在她穿结婚礼服的时候收到的吗？在八点四十五分的时候？”","“Which she received,” I struck in, “when she was dressing for her marriage?At twenty minutes to nine?”"
"“就是那时候。”赫伯特点头说，“之后她就把所有的钟都停了。信里到底说了什么，以至于能无情地毁掉那场婚礼，这件事我无法告诉你，因为我也不知道。在她从一场大病中康复过来之后，她就把那一整片地产都弃置了，就像你已经看到的那样，而且自那以后，她就没有出来见过天日。”","“At the hour and minute,” said Herbert, nodding, “at which she afterwards stopped all the clocks.What was in it, further than that it most heartlessly broke the marriage off, I can’t tell you, because I don’t know.When she recovered from a bad illness that she had, she laid the whole place waste, as you have seen it, and she has never since looked upon the light of day.”"
"“这些就是故事的全部了？”我思考了一阵，问道。","“Is that all the story?” I asked, after considering it."
"“这些是我所知道的一切了，我也确实只知道这么多了，而且还是我自己串起来的。因为我父亲总是避免谈到这个，即使是当郝维仙小姐邀请我过去的时候，除了我必须明白的事情之外，他也没有多说任何事。但我忘记提一件事。据说，她错信了的那个男人一直都是和她同父异母的弟弟串谋的，那是他们两个的阴谋，之后他们瓜分了骗来的钱。”","“All I know of it; and indeed I only know so much, through piecing it out for myself; for my father always avoids it, and, even when Miss Havisham invited me to go there, told me no more of it than it was absolutely requisite I should understand.But I have forgotten one thing.It has been supposed that the man to whom she gave her misplaced confidence, acted throughout in concert with her half-brother; that it was a conspiracy between them; and that they shared the profits.”"
"“我不明白，为什么他不先和她结婚，然后占有她全部的财产呢？”我说。","“I wonder he didn’t marry her and get all the property,” said I."
"“他可能已经结过婚了，让她忍受着残忍的屈辱也许是她同父异母的弟弟计划中的一部分。”赫伯特说，","“He may have been married already, and her cruel mortification may have been a part of her half-brother’s scheme,” said Herbert."
"“注意！这件事我不清楚。”","“Mind! I don’t know that.”"
"“那两个男的之后怎么样了呢？”我又想了一下，问道。","“What became of the two men?” I asked, after again considering the subject."
"“他们陷入了更深的无耻和堕落之中——如果还能比这些更恶劣的话——最后毁了自己。”","“They fell into deeper shame and degradation—if there can be deeper—and ruin.”"
"“他们现在还在世吗？”","“Are they alive now?”"
"“我不知道。”","“I don’t know.”"
"“你刚才说埃斯特拉和郝维仙小姐没有血缘关系，只是收养关系而已。那么，她是什么时候被收养的呢？”","“You said just now, that Estella was not related to Miss Havisham, but adopted.When adopted?”"
"赫伯特耸了耸肩。“自从我听说郝维仙小姐以来，埃斯特拉就一直在。其他的我就不知道了。现在呢，汉德尔，”他终于讲完了整个故事，说，“我们两个人之间已经没有秘密了。我所知道的一切关于郝维仙小姐的事，你都知道了。”","Herbert shrugged his shoulders.“There has always been an Estella, since I have heard of a Miss Havisham.I know no more.And now, Handel,” said he, finally throwing off the story as it were, “there is a perfectly open understanding between us.All that I know about Miss Havisham, you know.”"
"“我所知道的一切，”我回答说，“你也知道了。”","“And all that I know,” I retorted, “you know.”"
"“这一点我完全相信。所以我们之间就不会存在竞争和困惑了。现如今你处在生命中的上升期——也就是说，你不必去询问或讨论你到底欠谁的——你要明白，我或者是我的人永远都不可能侵占甚至靠近你所拥有的东西。”","“I fully believe it.So there can be no competition or perplexity between you and me.And as to the condition on which you hold your advancement in life—namely, that you are not to inquire or discuss to whom you owe it—you may be very sure that it will never be encroached upon, or even approached, by me, or by any one belonging to me.”"
"实际上，他的这些话说得实在非常微妙，我感觉，即便我在随后的许多年都住在他父亲的房子里，也不会有人再说起这个话题了。然而，他的这些话也带有很多含义，我感觉，他已经非常清楚郝维仙小姐就是我的恩主了，而这一点我自己也知道。","In truth, he said this with so much delicacy, that I felt the subject done with, even though I should be under his father’s roof for years and years to come.Yet he said it with so much meaning, too, that I felt he as perfectly understood Miss Havisham to be my benefactress, as I understood the fact myself."
"我从没想过他说起这个话题是为了把它从我们之间清除出去。但是说开之后，我们感觉那么放松、从容，我现在才明白事情原来是这样的。我们之间的相处愉快而友善，在谈话期间，我就问他是做什么的。他回答说：“一个资本家——船运保险商。”我猜他看到我环视屋内想找寻和船运或资本有关的标志，他补充道：“都在伦敦金融城里。”","It had not occurred to me before, that he had led up to the theme for the purpose of clearing it out of our way; but we were so much the lighter and easier for having broached it, that I now perceived this to be the case.We were very gay and sociable, and I asked him, in the course of conversation, what he was?He replied, “A capitalist—an Insurer of Ships.”I suppose he saw me glancing about the room in search of some tokens of Shipping, or capital, for he added, “In the City.”"
"我对伦敦金融城里的船运保险商的财富和重要性有很深的认识，所以我开始以敬畏之心想着，我曾经把一个年轻的保险商摔倒在地，打青他那双目光远大的眼睛，打破他那只担当重任的脑袋。但是我脑袋里又出现了那个赫伯特·鄱凯特永远也不会非常成功和富有的奇怪印象。","I had grand ideas of the wealth and importance of Insurers of Ships in the City, and I began to think with awe, of having laid a young Insurer on his back, blackened his enterprising eye, and cut his responsible head open.But, again, there came upon me, for my relief, that odd impression that Herbert Pocket would never be very successful or rich."
"“我不会仅仅满足于将我的资金投资到船运保险上的。我会买下一些有前景的人寿保险股票，向该部门进军。我还想涉足采矿业。而且这些生意也不会阻碍我租几千吨位的航船，为自己谋点利益。我想我会做贸易，”他靠在椅背上说，“把生意做到东印度群岛去，经营丝绸、披肩、香料、染料、药品和珍贵木材的生意。这些可是利益丰厚的生意。”","“I shall not rest satisfied with merely employing my capital in insuring ships.I shall buy up some good Life Assurance shares, and cut into the Direction.I shall also do a little in the mining way.None of these things will interfere with my chartering a few thousand tons on my own account.I think I shall trade,” said he, leaning back in his chair, “to the East Indies, for silks, shawls, spices, dyes, drugs, and precious woods.It’s an interesting trade.”"
"“利润那么大吗？”我说。","“And the profits are large?” said I. "
"“非常可观！”他说。","“Tremendous!” said he. "
"我又犹豫了一下，开始觉得这个人有着比我自己更远大的前程。","I wavered again, and began to think here were greater expectations than my own."
"“我想我也应该，”他说着，将拇指插入背心的口袋里，“进军西印度群岛，做食糖、烟草和朗姆酒的生意。还要去锡兰，特别是做象牙交易。”","“I think I shall trade, also,” said he, putting his thumbs in his waistcoat pockets, “to the West Indies, for sugar, tobacco, and rum.Also to Ceylon, specially for elephants’ tusks.”"
"“那么你需要很多航船。”我说。","“You will want a good many ships,” said I."
"“要一整个船队。”他说。","“A perfect fleet,” said he."
"我着实被他庞大的生意震撼了，我问他目前他承保的航船大部分是去哪里做生意的。","Quite overpowered by the magnificence of these transactions, I asked him where the ships he insured mostly traded to at present?"
"“我还没有开始我的保险生意呢。”他回答说，“我还在观望阶段。”","“I haven’t begun insuring yet,” he replied.“I am looking about me.”"
"不知何故，这种追求和这个巴纳德旅馆很相称。我说（以一种信以为真的语气）：“哦！”","Somehow, that pursuit seemed more in keeping with Barnard’s Inn.I said (in a tone of conviction), “Ah-h!”"
"“是的。我现在在一家会计所里工作，而且在密切留意此事。”","“Yes.I am in a counting-house, and looking about me.”"
"“会计工作的利润大吗？”我问。","“Is a counting-house profitable?” I asked."
"“你是指——你是指在里面工作的年轻人吗？”他反问道。","“To—do you mean to the young fellow who’s in it?” he asked, in reply."
"“是的，对于你来说。”","“Yes; to you.”"
"“啊，不，我拿不到多少利润。”他说这句话的语气就好像在仔细估算着什么，尽量做到平衡处理。“没有直接的利润。就是说，他们不付给我任何薪水，所以我必须——养活我自己。”","“Why, n-no: not to me.”He said this with the air of one carefully reckoning up and striking a balance.“Not directly profitable.That is, it doesn’t pay me anything, and I have to—keep myself.”"
"那么，这份工作看来的确没有什么利润。我摇了摇头，好像在暗示，以如此薪水的工作是很难积累很多资本的。","This certainly had not a profitable appearance, and I shook my head as if I would imply that it would be difficult to lay by much accumulative capital from such a source of income."
"“但是关键在于，”赫伯特·鄱凯特说，“你在观望之中。这点意义重大。你看，你在会计所里工作，而且在观望其他生意。”","“But the thing is,” said Herbert Pocket, “that you look about you.That’s the grand thing.You are in a counting-house, you know, and you look about you.”"
"这句话在我理解有这样的含义，就是离开会计所你就没法再观望了。但是我没有出声，以对他的经历表示尊重。","It struck me as a singular implication that you couldn’t be out of a counting-house, you know, and look about you; but I silently deferred to his experience."
"“然后在时机到来的时候，”他说，“你就会看见在你面前敞开一扇门。然后你走进去，猛扑上去，得到你的资本，那么你就成功了！你一旦有了自己的资本，你就可以好好利用它了。”","“Then the time comes,” said Herbert, “when you see your opening.And you go in, and you swoop upon it and you make your capital, and then there you are!When you have once made your capital, you have nothing to do but employ it.”"
"这些和我们在花园相遇时他的举止很相似，非常相似。他忍受贫穷的方式也正好符合了他忍受我击打时的样子。在我看来，他就像当初忍受我对他的拳脚相向一样忍受命运的所有打击。很明显，除了最简单的生活必需品之外，他一无所有，因为我注意到的一切东西好像都是为了我而从咖啡馆或其他地方搬过来的。","This was very like his way of conducting that encounter in the garden; very like.His manner of bearing his poverty, too, exactly corresponded to his manner of bearing that defeat.It seemed to me that he took all blows and buffets now, with just the same air as he had taken mine then.It was evident that he had nothing around him but the simplest necessaries, for everything that I remarked upon turned out to have been sent in on my account from the coffee-house or somewhere else."
"然而，在他的意识里他已经积累了很多的财富，但是他还是对此那么谦逊，所以我非常感激他能保持这样的态度。这些使他原本就很轻松的性格更让人感到愉快，我们相处得非常好。晚上我们去街上散步，去了戏院看半价票的戏。第二天，我们去了威斯敏斯特教堂，下午去公园走了走，我想知道是谁为那里所有的马上的马掌，我希望是乔做的。","Yet, having already made his fortune in his own mind, he was so unassuming with it that I felt quite grateful to him for not being puffed up.It was a pleasant addition to his naturally pleasant ways, and we got on famously.In the evening we went out for a walk in the streets, and went half-price to the Theatre; and next day we went to church at Westminster Abbey, and in the afternoon we walked in the Parks; and I wondered who shod all the horses there, and wished Joe did."
"保守估计，自从那个星期天我和乔还有比迪告别以来，已经过去了好几个月了。自己和他们之间产生了距离，而且在慢慢扩大，我们的沼泽地已经离我非常遥远了。就在上个星期天，我本可以穿着以前的节日礼服站在我们古老的教堂里。现在，无论是从地理上、地位上、阳历上还是阴历上来看，这些都成了完全不可能的事。然而在伦敦的街上，人潮拥挤，明亮的灯光在夜幕下闪烁，我的心中有些压抑的暗示，好像在责备自己把贫穷、陈旧的厨房推得离自己那么远。在夜深人静的时候，一个无能的人充当着看门人，在巴纳德旅馆里闲逛，装作在看守这个旅馆的样子，他的脚步声在我的心里回荡。","On a moderate computation, it was many months, that Sunday, since I had left Joe and Biddy.The space interposed between myself and them, partook of that expansion, and our marshes were any distance off.That I could have been at our old church in my old church-going clothes, on the very last Sunday that ever was, seemed a combination of impossibilities, geographical and social, solar and lunar.Yet in the London streets, so crowded with people and so brilliantly lighted in the dusk of evening, there were depressing hints of reproaches for that I had put the poor old kitchen at home so far away; and in the dead of night, the footsteps of some incapable impostor of a porter mooning about Barnard’s Inn, under pretence of watching it, fell hollow on my heart."
"星期一早晨的八点四十五，赫伯特去了会计所报到——我猜也是去观望——我就陪他一起去了。他会在一两个小时内离开，去哈默史密斯和我会合，所以我要在周围等着他。在我眼里，从初露头角的巨鳄们在星期一早上涌去的地方来看，那些能孵出年轻保险商的蛋，都是在尘土和闷热中孵化的，就像鸵鸟蛋一样。赫伯特帮忙的那个会计所在我看来也不是一个好的观望台。它在后面院子的二楼上，看起来污秽、肮脏，面对着的不是外面，而是另一个后院的二楼。","On the Monday morning at a quarter before nine, Herbert went to the counting-house to report himself—to look about him, too, I suppose—and I bore him company.He was to come away in an hour or two to attend me to Hammersmith, and I was to wait about for him.It appeared to me that the eggs from which young Insurers were hatched, were incubated in dust and heat, like the eggs of ostriches, judging from the places to which those incipient giants repaired on a Monday morning.Nor did the counting-house where Herbert assisted, show in my eyes as at all a good Observatory; being a back second floor up a yard, of a grimy presence in all particulars, and with a look into another back second floor, rather than a look out."
"我一直等到中午，进了证券交易所，看到头发蓬松的男人们坐在运输单据下面，我把那些人当做是了不起的商人，尽管我不明白为什么他们都那么没精打采。赫伯特过来了，我们去了一个有名的餐厅吃了午餐，那时候我对那里非常有好感，而现在我觉得那里是欧洲最可怜的迷信，就在那时，我也不禁注意到桌布上、刀上和服务员衣服上的汤汁比牛排上的还多。我们吃的套餐价钱公道（考虑到不收钱的油脂）。之后我们回到巴纳德旅馆，拿了我的小旅行皮箱，然后坐上长途马车，去了哈默史密斯。我们在下午两三点的时候到了那里，那里离鄱凯特先生的家非常近，没几步路就到了。我们拔起门上的插销，直接走进了可以俯瞰河流的小花园，鄱凯特先生的孩子正在在河边玩耍。除非我特别喜欢自欺欺人，到了说我不关心自身利益和财产的程度，我才能否认我的发现——鄱凯特先生和太太的孩子们还是没有长大，或者说不是养大的，而是摔大的。","I waited about until it was noon, and I went upon ’Change, and I saw fluey men sitting there under the bills about shipping, whom I took to be great merchants, though I couldn’t understand why they should all be out of spirits.When Herbert came, we went and had lunch at a celebrated house which I then quite venerated, but now believe to have been the most abject superstition in Europe, and where I could not help noticing, even then, that there was much more gravy on the tablecloths and knives and waiters’ clothes, than in the steaks.This collation disposed of at a moderate price (considering the grease: which was not charged for), we went back to Barnard’s Inn and got my little portmanteau, and then took coach for Hammersmith.We arrived there at two or three o’clock in the afternoon, and had very little way to walk to Mr. Pocket’s house.Lifting the latch of a gate, we passed direct into a little garden overlooking the river, where Mr. Pocket’s children were playing about.And unless I deceive myself on a point where my interests or prepossessions are certainly not concerned, I saw that Mr. and Mrs. Pocket’s children were not growing up or being brought up, but were tumbling up."
"鄱凯特太太正坐在树下的花园椅上读书，她的脚搭在另一张花园椅上。鄱凯特太太的两个女佣则看着孩子们玩耍。“孩子他妈，”赫伯特说，“这位是小皮普先生。”听到这些，鄱凯特太太以亲切而高贵的举止接待了我。","Mrs. Pocket was sitting on a garden chair under a tree, reading, with her legs upon another garden chair; and Mrs. Pocket’s two nursemaids were looking about them while the children played.“Mamma,” said Herbert, “this is young Mr. Pip.”Upon which Mrs. Pocket received me with an appearance of amiable dignity."
"“阿利克少爷和简小姐，”一个保姆对两个孩子说，“你们要是在灌木丛中跳来跳去的话，你们会掉进河里淹死的，之后你们的爸爸会说些什么？”","“Master Alick and Miss Jane,” cried one of the nurses to two of the children, “if you go a-bouncing up against them bushes you’ll fall over into the river and be drownded, and what’ll your pa say then?”"
"同时，这个保姆捡起鄱凯特太太的手帕，说：“要是您能不把手帕掉第六次的话就好了，太太！”听着那些话，鄱凯特太太笑着说：“谢谢，弗洛普森。”然后将自己蜷在一张椅子里，继续看书。她立即假装皱起眉头，显出一副专心致志的表情，就好像她已经读了一个星期的书一样，但是她还没读几行，就盯着我，说道：“你妈妈身体可好？”这突然的问询让我陷入了困难的境地，我开始荒谬地说着，如果我有妈妈的话，我肯定她身体会很好，她也会非常感激，并转达她的问候，这时保姆过来将我解救了。","At the same time this nurse picked up Mrs. Pocket’s handkerchief, and said, “If that don’t make six times you’ve dropped it, Mum!”Upon which Mrs. Pocket laughed and said, “Thank you, Flopson,” and settling herself in one chair only, resumed her book.Her countenance immediately assumed a knitted and intent expression as if she had been reading for a week, but before she could have read half a dozen lines, she fixed her eyes upon me, and said, “I hope your mamma is quite well?”This unexpected inquiry put me into such a difficulty that I began saying in the absurdest way that if there had been any such person I had no doubt she would have been quite well and would have been very much obliged and would have sent her compliments, when the nurse came to my rescue."
"“啊！”她捡起了小小的手帕，叫道，“但愿没有第七次！您今天下午怎么了，太太！”鄱凯特太太收起了她的东西，起先满脸带着难以形容的诧异，就好像她从没见过这个东西一样，之后才认出了它，笑了一下，说道：“谢谢你，弗洛普森。”然后就忘了我，继续看起书来。","“Well!” she cried, picking up the pocket handkerchief, “if that don’t make seven times!What are you a-doing of this afternoon, Mum!”Mrs. Pocket received her property, at first with a look of unutterable surprise as if she had never seen it before, and then with a laugh of recognition, and said, “Thank you, Flopson,” and forgot me, and went on reading."
"现在我有空数了一下，发现那里至少有六个小鄱凯特，年龄不一，都是摔大的。直到我听见远处传来第七个哀号的声音，才算把他们数全了。","I found, now I had leisure to count them, that there were no fewer than six little Pockets present, in various stages of tumbling up.I had scarcely arrived at the total when a seventh was heard, as in the region of air, wailing dolefully."
"“是宝宝在哭！”弗洛普森看起来非常惊讶地说道，“快一点，米勒斯。”","“If there ain’t baby!” said Flopson, appearing to think it most surprising.“Make haste up, Millers.”"
"另一个保姆米勒斯进了房子，孩子的哀号便慢慢地安静下来，最后停了下来，就好像嘴里含着东西的年轻的口技表演者一样。鄱凯特太太一直在读书，我很好奇她读的到底是什么书。","Millers, who was the other nurse, retired into the house, and by degrees the child’s wailing was hushed and stopped, as if it were a young ventriloquist with something in its mouth.Mrs. Pocket read all the time, and I was curious to know what the book could be."
"我猜想，我们是在等鄱凯特先生出来。无论如何我们都要在这里等着，于是我有机会观察了这一值得注意的家庭现象。任何一个孩子只要在鄱凯特太太身边玩耍，他们总会把自己绊倒，倒在她的身上——那一瞬间总是让她非常惊讶，而他们自己则伤心地哭起来。我不知道如何解释这一令人惊讶的情况，也不禁暗自思忖起来。最后，米勒斯带着宝宝下来，将宝宝交给了弗洛普森，弗洛普森再交给鄱凯特太太，而她自己也向鄱凯特太太扑了过去，最后她和宝宝都是被赫伯特和我抓住的。","We were waiting, I supposed, for Mr. Pocket to come out to us; at any rate we waited there, and so I had an opportunity of observing the remarkable family phenomenon that whenever any of the children strayed near Mrs. Pocket in their play, they always tripped themselves up and tumbled over her—always very much to her momentary astonishment, and their own more enduring lamentation.I was at a loss to account for this surprising circumstance, and could not help giving my mind to speculations about it, until by-and-by Millers came down with the baby, which baby was handed to Flopson, which Flopson was handing it to Mrs. Pocket, when she too went fairly head foremost over Mrs. Pocket, baby and all, and was caught by Herbert and myself."
"“我的天啊。弗洛普森！”鄱凯特太太说道，眼睛离开了书本一会儿，“所有人都在摔跤！”","“Gracious me, Flopson!” said Mrs. Pocket, looking off her book for a moment, “everybody’s tumbling!”"
"“真的是啊，太太！”弗洛普森脸红着回答说，“您那里有什么东西？”","“Gracious you, indeed, Mum!” returned Flopson, very red in the face; “what have you got there?”"
"“有什么东西，弗洛普森？”鄱凯特太太说。","“I got here, Flopson?” asked Mrs. Pocket. "
"“哦，这个不是您的搭脚蹬吗！”弗洛普森喊道，“要是您把它像那样放在您的裙子下面，谁能不摔跤呢？嘿！抱好宝宝，太太，把您的书给我。”","“Why, if it ain’t your footstool!” cried Flopson. “And if you keep it under your skirts like that, who’s to help tumbling?Here!Take the baby, Mum, and give me your book.”"
"鄱凯特太太照着她的话做了，不熟练地把宝宝放在大腿上轻轻摇着，其他的孩子都过来逗着宝宝玩。这样仅仅维持了很短的时间，鄱凯特太太下了简短的命令，他们都要回房里去睡午觉。我抓住机会便有了第二个发现，小鄱凯特们的成长就是摔大和躺下二者所构成的。","Mrs. Pocket acted on the advice, and inexpertly danced the infant a little in her lap, while the other children played about it.This had lasted but a very short time, when Mrs. Pocket issued summary orders that they were all to be taken into the house for a nap.Thus I made the second discovery on that first occasion, that the nurture of the little Pockets consisted of alternately tumbling up and lying down."
"在这种情况下，当弗洛普森和米勒斯像赶着一小群羊似的带着孩子门进屋的时候，鄱凯特先生走出来见我。发现鄱凯特先生相当困惑的表情，我一点也不惊讶。只见他灰白的头发乱糟糟地顶在头上，就好像他不太懂得如何将所有事都打理得有条不紊似的。","Under these circumstances, when Flopson and Millers had got the children into the house, like a little flock of sheep, and Mr. Pocket came out of it to make my acquaintance, I was not much surprised to find that Mr. Pocket was a gentleman with a rather perplexed expression of face, and with his very grey hair disordered on his head, as if he didn’t quite see his way to putting anything straight."
"第二十三章","Chapter 23"
"鄱凯特先生说他很高兴见到我，他希望我见到他不会感到失望。“因为，我可真的不是，”他脸上挂着和他儿子一样的笑容，说道，“什么大人物。”即便他表情充满困惑，头发也已花白，但看起来却很年轻，而且举止似乎非常自然。我用“自然”这个字眼，是取其不造作之意。在他心神分散的举止之中又带有一丝滑稽，似乎他也意识到自己也有些滑稽，不然他就是真的极其愚蠢了。在他和我交谈了片刻之后，他担心地皱起了他又黑又漂亮的眉头，对鄱凯特太太说：“贝琳达，你问候皮普先生了吗？”她从书中抬起头说：“问候过了。”之后她漫不经心地对我笑了笑，问我喜不喜欢橘子花水的味道。这个问题和先前或后来的事情基本上没有一点关联，我认为她说出这句话，就像她刚才的态度一样，只是一句客套话而已。","Mr. Pocket said he was glad to see me, and he hoped I was not sorry to see him.“For, I really am not,” he added, with his son’s smile, “an alarming personage.”He was a young-looking man, in spite of his perplexities and his very grey hair, and his manner seemed quite natural.I use the word natural, in the sense of its being unaffected; there was something comic in his distraught way, as though it would have been downright ludicrous but for his own perception that it was very near being so.When he had talked with me a little, he said to Mrs. Pocket, with a rather anxious contraction of his eyebrows, which were black and handsome, “Belinda, I hope you have welcomed Mr. Pip?”And she looked up from her book, and said, “Yes.”She then smiled upon me in an absent state of mind, and asked me if I liked the taste of orange-flower water?As the question had no bearing, near or remote, on any foregone or subsequent transaction, I consider it to have been thrown out, like her previous approaches, in general conversational condescension."
"没过几个小时我就发现，而且马上就可以指出，鄱凯特太太是某位意外故去的骑士的独女。那位骑士自认为他已逝的父亲本应是位准男爵，但是有人完全因为个人目的而坚决反对——我忘记那个人是谁了，即便我当时知道——国王、首相、大法官、坎特伯雷大主教，或者是任何人——于是基于这个假想的事实，他将自己划入贵族的行列。我相信他自封为骑士，是因为他在某座建筑的奠基仪式上为誊写在牛皮纸上糟糕的演讲做了英语语法的修改，还有，因为他为某一位皇室名流递了泥铲或灰泥。不管怎么样，他从鄱凯特太太在摇篮里时就开始引导她长成一位理所应当嫁给王公贵族的小姐，而且防止她接触到平民的家务琐事。","I found out within a few hours, and may mention at once, that Mrs. Pocket was the only daughter of a certain quite accidental deceased Knight, who had invented for himself a conviction that his deceased father would have been made a Baronet but for somebody’s determined opposition arising out of entirely personal motives—I forget whose, if I ever knew—the Sovereign’s, the Prime Minister’s, the Lord Chancellor’s, the Archbishop of Canterbury’s, anybody’s—and had tacked himself on to the nobles of the earth in right of this quite supposititious fact.I believe he had been knighted himself for storming the English grammar at the point of the pen, in a desperate address engrossed on vellum, on the occasion of the laying of the first stone of some building or other, and for handing some Royal Personage either the trowel or the mortar.Be that as it may, he had directed Mrs. Pocket to be brought up from her cradle as one who in the nature of things must marry a title, and who was to be guarded from the acquisition of plebeian domestic knowledge."
"年轻的女士在父亲成功的时刻戒备之中出落得非常标致，但是却完全无助和无用。因此她的性格被塑造得恰到好处。当她正值花季之时，遇上了鄱凯特先生：他也正是风华正茂，还没有决定是要爬上上院议长的高位，还是要为自己戴上主教冠。不管他选任何一样都只是时间问题，他和鄱凯特太太便抓紧时机，共结连理，而他们当时的额发倒是有些偏长，需要剪剪了（注：原文中“时机”和“额发”都是forelock，为一词双关的用法）。而且他们是在那个明智的父亲不知情的情况下结的婚。这位明智的父亲不想赠予他们任何东西，却也不能什么也不给，结果就只能送上祝福，而这份嫁妆则是他经过一小段挣扎之后慷慨送出的，而且还告诉鄱凯特先生说他的妻子本是“献给王子的珍宝”。从那时开始，鄱凯特先生就教导这位“王子的珍宝”学习一些人情世故，而这些却只为他带来一些无关紧要的好处。大体而言，鄱凯特太太还是一位奇怪而值得尊敬的同情对象，因为她没有嫁给王公贵族。而鄱凯特先生则是一位奇怪而慈悲的受指责对象，因为他没有得到任何职位。","So successful a watch and ward had been established over the young lady by this judicious parent, that she had grown up highly ornamental, but perfectly helpless and useless.With her character thus happily formed, in the first bloom of her youth she had encountered Mr. Pocket: who was also in the first bloom of youth, and not quite decided whether to mount to the Woolsack, or to roof himself in with a miter.As his doing the one or the other was a mere question of time, he and Mrs. Pocket had taken Time by the forelock (when, to judge from its length, it would seem to have wanted cutting), and had married without the knowledge of the judicious parent.The judicious parent, having nothing to bestow or withhold but his blessing, had handsomely settled that dower upon them after a short struggle, and had informed Mr. Pocket that his wife was “a treasure for a Prince.”Mr. Pocket had invested the Prince’s treasure in the ways of the world ever since, and it was supposed to have brought him in but indifferent interest.Still, Mrs. Pocket was in general the object of a queer sort of respectful pity, because she had not married a title; while Mr. Pocket was the object of a queer sort of forgiving reproach, because he had never got one."
"鄱凯特先生带着我进了屋子，并向我展示了我的房间：这个房间非常舒适，布置很得体，我都能方便地将其用作我的私人起居室了。之后他敲了两个类似房间的门，把我介绍给了房间的居住者，他们分别叫德鲁莫尔和斯塔特普。德鲁莫尔是一位面相很老的年轻人，体格强壮，他正吹着口哨。斯塔特普无论在样貌上还是年龄上都要年轻一些，他正撑着头阅读，好像他觉得自己正处于危险之中，因为脑袋里装了太多知识而就要爆炸了一样。","Mr. Pocket took me into the house and showed me my room: which was a pleasant one, and so furnished as that I could use it with comfort for my own private sitting-room.He then knocked at the doors of two other similar rooms, and introduced me to their occupants, by name Drummle and Startop.Drummle, an old-looking young man of a heavy order of architecture, was whistling.Startop, younger in years and appearance, was reading and holding his head, as if he thought himself in danger of exploding it with too strong a charge of knowledge."
"鄱凯特先生和太太都带着一种显而易见的气质，让人觉得他们都被别人控制着。我想知道是谁真正拥有这座房子，还让他们住在这里，最后我发现，这种未知的力量竟掌握在仆人的手中。考虑到这样安排可以减少麻烦，事情还算是顺利的。但是看上去这样花销却非常大，因为仆人们都认为他们理所应当要吃得喝得很丰盛，还应当招待楼下的一群同伴。他们为鄱凯特夫妇准备的饭菜都很丰盛，但在我看来，到目前为止，厨房才是最好的住处，因为在那里能吃得最好——而且住在这里的人都有很强的自卫心理，因为我来这里还没到一个星期，一位和这一家人没有私交的、住在隔壁的女士写来一封信，说她见到米勒斯打过宝宝。这让鄱凯特太太非常伤心，她看到这封信之后就哭了起来，还说这事非常奇怪，邻居们为什么要来管她家的事情。","Both Mr. and Mrs. Pocket had such a noticeable air of being in somebody else’s hands, that I wondered who really was in possession of the house and let them live there, until I found this unknown power to be the servants.It was a smooth way of going on, perhaps, in respect of saving trouble; but it had the appearance of being expensive, for the servants felt it a duty they owed to themselves to be nice in their eating and drinking, and to keep a deal of company down stairs.They allowed a very liberal table to Mr. and Mrs. Pocket, yet it always appeared to me that by far the best part of the house to have boarded in, would have been the kitchen—always supposing the boarder capable of self-defense, for, before I had been there a week, a neighboring lady with whom the family were personally unacquainted, wrote in to say that she had seen Millers slapping the baby.This greatly distressed Mrs. Pocket, who burst into tears on receiving the note, and said that it was an extraordinary thing that the neighbors couldn’t mind their own business."
"我渐渐地从赫伯特那里了解到，鄱凯特先生曾就读于哈罗和剑桥，在那里他非常出名。但是在他早年就享受到和鄱凯特太太的婚姻幸福的同时，他的前途也就变得暗淡了，最终做起了补习老师，负责磨快学生的脑子。在“磨”了很多头脑如钝刀的学生后——那些学生的父亲在有权势时总是说要提携他一把，但是一旦学生从他那里“磨”了出来，他们就会把这事望到脑后——他厌倦了这份乏味的工作，来到了伦敦。在这里，当他高尚点的愿望都一一破灭之后，他又和各种人物一起“读书”，那些人要不就缺少机遇，要不就忽略了机会。他为了一些特别场合将各种人物来“磨”锋利，将他自己的习得用于文学上的编辑和校对，借此谋得一些微薄的私人收入，好维持我看到的这所房子。","By degrees I learnt, and chiefly from Herbert, that Mr. Pocket had been educated at Harrow and at Cambridge, where he had distinguished himself; but that when he had had the happiness of marrying Mrs. Pocket very early in life, he had impaired his prospects and taken up the calling of a Grinder.After grinding a number of dull blades—of whom it was remarkable that their fathers, when influential, were always going to help him to preferment, but always forgot to do it when the blades had left the Grindstone—he had wearied of that poor work and had come to London.Here, after gradually failing in loftier hopes, he had “read” with divers who had lacked opportunities or neglected them, and had refurbished divers others for special occasions, and had turned his acquirements to the account of literary compilation and correction, and on such means, added to some very moderate private resources, still maintained the house I saw."
"鄱凯特夫妇有一位爱拍马屁的邻居；一位极具同情心的寡妇，她同意每一个人的看法，祝福每一个人，而且根据情况对每一个人都致以笑容和泪水。这位女士名叫考埃勒太太，我有幸能在我入住的那一天和她一起用餐。在下楼的时候，她就让我明白了，鄱凯特先生不得不教绅士们读书这件事对于鄱凯特太太来说是个打击。但是她满怀爱意并充满信心（那时候，我认识她还不到五分钟）地告诉我说，这些并不包括我，要是所有的学生都能像我一样，那样事情就大不一样了。","Mr. and Mrs. Pocket had a toady neighbor; a widow lady of that highly sympathetic nature that she agreed with everybody, blessed everybody, and shed smiles and tears on everybody, according to circumstances.This lady’s name was Mrs. Coiler, and I had the honor of taking her down to dinner on the day of my installation.She gave me to understand on the stairs, that it was a blow to dear Mrs. Pocket that dear Mr. Pocket should be under the necessity of receiving gentlemen to read with him.That did not extend to me, she told me in a gush of love and confidence (at that time, I had known her something less than five minutes); if they were all like Me, it would be quite another thing."
"“但是亲爱的鄱凯特太太，”考埃勒太太说，“在她起初的失望情绪之后（因为亲爱的鄱凯特先生在这件事上无可指责），她要求那么多奢华和优雅的生活——”","“But dear Mrs. Pocket,” said Mrs. Coiler, “after her early disappointment (not that dear Mr. Pocket was to blame in that), requires so much luxury and elegance—”"
"“是的，太太。”我为了阻止她继续说下去，连忙插话，因为我害怕她说着会哭起来。","“Yes, ma’am,” I said, to stop her, for I was afraid she was going to cry."
"“而且她有着如此贵族化的性情——”","“And she is of so aristocratic a disposition—”"
"“是的，太太。”我又说道，还是为了刚才那个目的。","“Yes, ma’am,” I said again, with the same object as before."
"“——还有一件很困难的事，”考埃勒太太说，“就是将鄱凯特先生的时间和注意力从亲爱的鄱凯特太太的身上转移开来。”","“—that it is hard,” said Mrs. Coiler, “to have dear Mr. Pocket’s time and attention diverted from dear Mrs. Pocket.”"
"我不禁想到，要是让一个屠夫将其时间和注意力从亲爱的鄱凯特太太身上转移开来，可能还要困难一些。但是我什么都没说，这样的确是为了尽力维持自己与他人在一起时的礼节。","I could not help thinking that it might be harder if the butcher’s time and attention were diverted from dear Mrs. Pocket; but I said nothing, and indeed had enough to do in keeping a bashful watch upon my company-manners."
"正在我专注于我的刀叉、汤匙、玻璃杯和其他自杀工具的同时，我从鄱凯特太太和德鲁莫尔之间的交流中了解到，教名为本特利的德鲁莫尔实际上是一位准男爵的第二继承人。我进一步发现，我在花园里看到鄱凯特太太在读的那本书是有关爵位的，只要她祖父真的是个准男爵的话，她就会知道他列入此书的具体日期。德鲁莫尔话不多，但从他有限的话语中（他留给我的印象是个阴沉的家伙），我发现他的语气像一个高贵的人，而且把鄱凯特太太当成姐妹一样对待。只有他们自己和谄媚的邻居考埃勒太太对这部分谈话感兴趣，而且在我看来，赫伯特感到很痛苦。但是这样可能要持续很久，幸亏一个男侍从走进来宣布了一个让家里人苦恼的消息。这件事就是厨师找不到牛肉了。让我十分惊愕的是，现在我第一次看到鄱凯特先生松了一口气，他的动作让我感到万分诧异，但是其他人都没有在意，于是很快我就像其他人一样不以为奇了。他放下了他的餐刀和叉子——那时他还在专心切肉——把双手插进了蓬乱的头发里，好像费了很大力气要把自己揪起来。他做完了这些也没有把自己揪起来，又安静地继续切肉。","It came to my knowledge, through what passed between Mrs. Pocket and Drummle while I was attentive to my knife and fork, spoon, glasses, and other instruments of self-destruction, that Drummle, whose Christian name was Bentley, was actually the next heir but one to a baronetcy.It further appeared that the book I had seen Mrs. Pocket reading in the garden, was all about titles, and that she knew the exact date at which her grandpapa would have come into the book, if he ever had come at all.Drummle didn’t say much, but in his limited way (he struck me as a sulky kind of fellow) he spoke as one of the elect, and recognized Mrs. Pocket as a woman and a sister.No one but themselves and Mrs. Coiler the toady neighbor showed any interest in this part of the conversation, and it appeared to me that it was painful to Herbert; but it promised to last a long time, when the page came in with the announcement of a domestic affliction.It was, in effect, that the cook had mislaid the beef.To my unutterable amazement, I now, for the first time, saw Mr. Pocket relieve his mind by going through a performance that struck me as very extraordinary, but which made no impression on anybody else, and with which I soon became as familiar as the rest.He laid down the carving-knife and fork—being engaged in carving, at the moment—put his two hands into his disturbed hair, and appeared to make an extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it.When he had done this, and had not lifted himself up at all, he quietly went on with what he was about."
"之后考埃勒太太换了一个话题，开始恭维我。我有一段时间很喜欢听，但是她的赞美过分夸张，让这种愉悦情绪很快就消失了。她以一种婉转的方式接近我，假装对我的朋友和家乡非常感兴趣，总体而言就是非常阴险，舌头像尖叉一样。当她偶然提到斯塔德普的时候（他跟她聊得非常少），又或者说道德鲁莫尔的时候（他跟她说得更少），我几乎嫉妒他们坐到了桌子的另一边。","Mrs. Coiler then changed the subject, and began to flatter me.I liked it for a few moments, but she flattered me so very grossly that the pleasure was soon over.She had a serpentine way of coming close at me when she pretended to be vitally interested in the friends and localities I had left, which was altogether snaky and fork-tongued; and when she made an occasional bounce upon Startop (who said very little to her), or upon Drummle (who said less), I rather envied them for being on the opposite side of the table."
"晚餐之后，孩子们被一一介绍给我们，考埃勒太太则对他们的眼睛、鼻子、腿作了赞赏的评价——这样倒是提高他们心智的精明之道。那里有四个小女孩，两个小男孩，此外还有一个我不知道性别的宝宝，以及同样无法分辨性别的下一个宝宝。他们是由弗洛普森和米勒斯带进来的，这些孩子就好像是这两位未经委任的长官从某处招募而来的一样：在鄱凯特太太看着这些本应是年轻贵族的孩子们时，她好像认为她应该提前检查一下他们，而现在又不知道该拿他们怎么办好一样。","After dinner the children were introduced, and Mrs. Coiler made admiring comments on their eyes, noses, and legs—a sagacious way of improving their minds.There were four little girls, and two little boys, besides the baby who might have been either, and the baby’s next successor who was as yet neither.They were brought in by Flopson and Millers, much as though those two noncommissioned officers had been recruiting somewhere for children and had enlisted these: while Mrs. Pocket looked at the young Nobles that ought to have been, as if she rather thought she had had the pleasure of inspecting them before, but didn’t quite know what to make of them."
"“看这里！把您的叉子给我，妈妈，抱着宝宝。”弗洛普森说，“不要那样抱宝宝，否则他的头就在桌子下面了。”","“Here!Give me your fork, Mum, and take the baby,” said Flopson.“Don’t take it that way, or you’ll get its head under the table.”"
"这样建议了之后，鄱凯特太太便换了一种姿势抱宝宝，将头置于桌面之上，在场众人却听到一声巨大的撞击声。","Thus advised, Mrs. Pocket took it the other way, and got its head upon the table; which was announced to all present by a prodigious concussion."
"“天啊，天啊！还是给我抱吧，妈妈。”弗洛普森说，“简小姐，来给孩子跳舞，快！”","“Dear, dear!Give it me back, Mum,” said Flopson; “and Miss Jane, come and dance to baby, do!”"
"一个似乎过早地将自己置于照顾他人的责任之中的小女孩从我身边的位置站了出来，在宝宝面前来来去去地跳舞，直到宝宝破涕为笑为止。之后，所有的孩子都笑了起来，鄱凯特先生（期间他两次用力试图抓着头发把自己揪起来）也笑了，我们都开心地笑了起来。","One of the little girls, a mere mite who seemed to have prematurely taken upon herself some charge of the others, stepped out of her place by me, and danced to and from the baby until it left off crying, and laughed.Then, all the children laughed, and Mr. Pocket (who in the meantime had twice endeavoured to lift himself up by the hair) laughed, and we all laughed and were glad."
"弗洛普森把宝宝的双腿重叠起来，就像只荷兰洋娃娃那样，之后将其安全地放在鄱凯特太太的大腿上，还给他一个胡桃钳让他玩弄。同时告诫鄱凯特太太说留心不要让那工具的手柄戳进孩子的眼睛，而且严厉地责令简小姐注意着。然后，两个保姆离开了房间，在楼梯上和那个侍候用餐的、放荡的男仆互相厮打起来，很清楚，他在赌桌上输得不太清醒了。","Flopson, by dint of doubling the baby at the joints like a Dutch doll, then got it safely into Mrs. Pocket’s lap, and gave it the nutcrackers to play with: at the same time recommending Mrs. Pocket to take notice that the handles of that instrument were not likely to agree with its eyes, and sharply charging Miss Jane to look after the same.Then, the two nurses left the room, and had a lively scuffle on the staircase with a dissipated page who had waited at dinner, and who had clearly lost half his buttons at the gamingtable."
"当鄱凯特太太和德鲁莫尔谈起关于两位准男爵的话题时，我感到非常不自在。她吃了一片浸在糖和葡萄酒里的橙子，就全然忘记了在她腿上的孩子：他拿着胡桃钳做着极度危险的事。最后，小简发现他那只幼小的脑袋正处于危险之中，便轻轻地离开了她的位置，耐心地使出各种方法哄着孩子交出武器。大约在同一时间鄱凯特太太也吃完了橙子，她对简的行为不是很满意，说道：","I was made very uneasy in my mind by Mrs. Pocket’s falling into a discussion with Drummle respecting two baronetcies, while she ate a sliced orange steeped in sugar and wine, and forgetting all about the baby on her lap: who did most appalling things with the nutcrackers.At length, little Jane perceiving its young brains to be imperilled, softly left her place, and with many small artifices coaxed the dangerous weapon away.Mrs. Pocket finishing her orange at about the same time, and not approving of this, said to Jane:"
"“你这个淘气的孩子，怎么这么大胆？赶快坐回你的位子！”","“You naughty child, how dare you?Go and sit down this instant!”"
"“亲爱的妈妈，”小女孩儿口齿不清地说，“宝宝会把自己的眼珠挖出来的。”","“Mamma dear,” lisped the little girl, “baby ood have put hith eyeth out.”"
"“你怎么敢这样跟我说话？”鄱凯特太太反问道，“立马回到你的座位上去！”","“How dare you tell me so?” retorted Mrs. Pocket. “Go and sit down in your chair this moment!”"
"鄱凯特太太的尊严如此不容侵犯，让我感到相当窘迫，好像是我做了什么事而引起的一样。","Mrs. Pocket’s dignity was so crushing, that I felt quite abashed: as if I myself had done something to rouse it."
"“贝琳达，”坐在桌子另一边的鄱凯特先生抗议道，“你怎么能那样蛮不讲理呢？简插手只是为了保护宝宝。”","“Belinda,” remonstrated Mr. Pocket, from the other end of the table, “how can you be so unreasonable?Jane only interfered for the protection of baby.”"
"“我不允许任何人插手。”鄱凯特太太说，“我非常惊讶，马修，你竟然让我遭到这样的冒犯和羞辱。”","“I will not allow anybody to interfere,” said Mrs. Pocket.“I am surprised, Matthew, that you should expose me to the affront of interference.”"
"“我的天啊！”鄱凯特先生感到一种苍凉的绝望，他喊道，“宝宝应该玩胡桃钳而丢了性命，却没有人去解救他们吗？”","“Good God!” cried Mr. Pocket, in an outbreak of desolate desperation.“Are infants to be nutcrackered into their tombs, and is nobody to save them?”"
"“我不会让简干涉我的。”鄱凯特太太以女王般的目光瞥了一眼无辜的小冒犯者，说道，“我希望我知道我可怜的祖父的地位。简，确实如此！”","“I will not be interfered with by Jane,” said Mrs. Pocket, with a majestic glance at that innocent little offender.“I hope I know my poor grandpapa’s position.Jane, indeed!”"
"鄱凯特先生又把手插进头发里，这次，他真的将自己揪得离开椅子几英寸了。“听着！”他无助地大声对大家说，“宝宝就要因为玩弄胡桃钳而死了，就是因为大家可怜的祖父的地位。”之后他又坐了下来，开始沉默。","Mr. Pocket got his hands in his hair again, and this time really did lift himself some inches out of his chair.“Hear this!” he helplessly exclaimed to the elements.“Babies are to be nutcrackered dead, for people’s poor grandpapa’s positions!”Then he let himself down again, and became silent."
"在这个过程中，我们都尴尬地看着桌布。停顿了一下之后，这个诚实而管不住的宝宝又对着小简又跳又笑，在我看着来那是他在这个家里唯一认识的成员（不考虑仆人的话）。","We all looked awkwardly at the table-cloth while this was going on.A pause succeeded, during which the honest and irrepressible baby made a series of leaps and crows at little Jane, who appeared to me to be the only member of the family (irrespective of servants) with whom it had any decided acquaintance."
"“德鲁莫尔先生，”鄱凯特太太说，“你能按铃叫一下弗洛普森吗？简，你这个不听话的小家伙，去睡觉去。现在，亲爱的宝宝，和妈妈一起走！”","“Mr. Drummle,” said Mrs. Pocket, “will you ring for Flopson?Jane, you undutiful little thing, go and lie down.Now, baby darling, come with ma!”"
"这个天真无邪的宝宝却用尽浑身力气在抵抗着。他在鄱凯特太太的怀里错误地扭曲着，露出一双缝制的鞋子和带着凹陷的脚踝，而柔软的脸却不见了，B134他正处于最激烈的抵抗之中。毕竟他的抵抗还是有了些成果，因为我在几分钟之后从窗子看到小家伙正由简照顾着。","The baby was the soul of honor, and protested with all its might.It doubled itself up the wrong way over Mrs. Pocket’s arm, exhibited a pair of knitted shoes and dimpled ankles to the company in lieu of its soft face, and was carried out in the highest state of mutiny.And it gained its point after all, for I saw it through the window within a few minutes, being nursed by little Jane."
"于是五个孩子被留在了餐桌上，因为弗洛普森正忙于自己的事情，而其他任何人也不管他们。于是我开始了解到他们和鄱凯特先生之间的关系，下述的行为可以作为例证。鄱凯特先生带着一脸固有的茫然站了起来，头发散乱，看了他们几分钟，就好像他还没弄明白，他们都是怎么来到这所房子里住下来的，为什么上天没有将他们安排在别的家里。之后，他以传教士的口吻问了他们一些问题，语气非常疏远——诸如为什么小乔的衣服上有个洞：小乔说，爸爸，弗洛普森有空的时候就会给我补了——还有为什么小范妮会有甲沟炎：她说，爸爸，米勒斯记起来的时候就会给我敷药了。之后，他又融入了父母般的温柔之中，给他们每人一先令，还让他们去玩。当他们出去之后，他最后用力揪着头发试图将自己提起来，然后他便不再考虑那个毫无希望的话题了。","It happened that the other five children were left behind at the dinner-table, through Flopson’s having some private engagement, and their not being anybody else’s business.I thus became aware of the mutual relations between them and Mr. Pocket, which were exemplified in the following manner.Mr. Pocket, with the normal perplexity of his face heightened and his hair rumpled, looked at them for some minutes, as if he couldn’t make out how they came to be boarding and lodging in that establishment, and why they hadn’t been billeted by Nature on somebody else.Then, in a distant, Missionary way he asked them certain questions—as why little Joe had that hole in his frill: who said, Pa, Flopson was going to mend it when she had time—and how little Fanny came by that whitlow: who said, Pa, Millers was going to poultice it when she didn’t forget.Then, he melted into parental tenderness, and gave them a shilling apiece and told them to go and play; and then as they went out, with one very strong effort to lift himself up by the hair he dismissed the hopeless subject."
"晚上，有人在河里划船。德鲁莫尔和斯塔特普各有一只小船，于是我下定决心也要拥有一只，而且要把他们俩都赶走。对于乡下孩子们熟悉的那些运动我都非常在行，但是我知道，在泰晤士河上划船需要优雅的风度——即使不说是在其他的河上——我立即便拜在了一位曾赢得奖品的人的门下，他在我们的楼梯那里辛勤工作，我在我的新同盟的介绍下认识了他。这位实践权威让我感到大为困惑，他说我有着铁匠一样的臂膀。要是他知道这句恭维的话差点让他失去了我这个学生的话，我怀疑他还会不会愿意这样恭维。","In the evening there was rowing on the river.As Drummle and Startop had each a boat, I resolved to set up mine, and to cut them both out.I was pretty good at most exercises in which countryboys are adepts, but, as I was conscious of wanting elegance of style for the Thames—not to say for other waters—I at once engaged to place myself under the tuition of the winner of a prizewherry who plied at our stairs, and to whom I was introduced by my new allies.This practical authority confused me very much, by saying I had the arm of a blacksmith.If he could have known how nearly the compliment lost him his pupil, I doubt if he would have paid it."
"晚上在我们回到家之后，一盘晚餐已经准备好了，我觉得要是没有发生相当不愉快的家庭事件的话，我们都会吃得很开心的。鄱凯特先生的心情很好，一位女佣进来说：“要是您愿意的话，先生，我希望能和您说些话。”“和你的主人说话？”自尊心再次燃起的鄱凯特太太说道，“你怎么能想出这种事情？去和弗洛普森说。或者找个其他时间跟我说。”","There was a supper-tray after we got home at night, and I think we should all have enjoyed ourselves, but for a rather disagreeable domestic occurrence.Mr. Pocket was in good spirits, when a housemaid came in, and said,“If you please, sir, I should wish to speak to you.”“Speak to your master?” said Mrs. Pocket, whose dignity was roused again.“How can you think of such a thing?Go and speak to Flopson.Or speak to me—at some other time.”"
"“请您原谅，太太。”女佣回答道，“我希望能立即就说，和我的主人说话。”","“Begging your pardon, ma’am,” returned the housemaid, “I should wish to speak at once, and to speak to master.”"
"因此，鄱凯特先生走出了房间，在他回来之前，我们尽情地享用了食物。","Hereupon, Mr. Pocket went out of the room, and we made the best of ourselves until he came back."
"“真是件美妙的事，贝琳达！”鄱凯特脸上挂着悲痛和绝望，回到屋子里说，“喝醉的厨子毫无知觉地躺在厨房的地板上，橱柜里还有一大包新鲜黄油，等着卖掉换点油脂！”","“This is a pretty thing, Belinda!” said Mr. Pocket, returning with a countenance expressive of grief and despair.“Here’s the cook lying insensibly drunk on the kitchen floor, with a large bundle of fresh butter made up in the cupboard ready to sell for grease!”"
"鄱凯特太太立即露出亲切的表情，说道：“都是可恶的索菲娅干的好事！”","Mrs. Pocket instantly showed much amiable emotion, and said, “This is that odious Sophia’s doing!”"
"“你是什么意思，贝琳达？”鄱凯特先生问道。","“What do you mean, Belinda?” demanded Mr. Pocket. "
"“索菲娅已经告诉你了。”鄱凯特太太说，“难道我没有亲眼见到她刚才进了你的房间，亲耳听到她想跟你聊聊吗？”","“Sophia has told you,” said Mrs. Pocket.“Did I not see her with my own eyes and hear her with my own ears, come into the room just now and ask to speak to you?”"
"“但是，难道贝琳达她不是已经把我带下楼，”鄱凯特先生回答说，“让我看到了那个女人和那一包黄油了吗？”","“But has she not taken me down stairs, Belinda,” returned Mr. Pocket, “and shown me the woman, and the bundle too?”"
"“你是在维护她，马修，”鄱凯特太太说，“为她的过失辩护吗？”","“And do you defend her, Matthew,” said Mrs. Pocket, “for making mischief?”"
"鄱凯特先生发出了一声凄凉的叹息。","Mr. Pocket uttered a dismal groan."
"“难道我身为祖父的孙女，在这个家里就毫无地位吗？”鄱凯特太太说，“而且，这个厨师一直是一位和蔼而有礼貌的人，当她来到这里打点家务的时候，她的谈吐非常自然，还说我天生就是公爵夫人的命。”","“Am I, grandpapa’s granddaughter, to be nothing in the house?” said Mrs. Pocket. “Besides, the cook has always been a very nice respectful woman, and said in the most natural manner when she came to look after the situation, that she felt I was born to be a Duchess.”"
"鄱凯特先生站着的地方有一张沙发，他如同一位垂死的角斗士一样瘫倒在这个沙发里。他连姿势都没有改变，以空洞的声音说道：“晚安，皮普先生。”这时我正觉得该离开他上床睡觉了。","There was a sofa where Mr. Pocket stood, and he dropped upon it in the attitude of the Dying Gladiator.Still in that attitude he said, with a hollow voice, “Good night, Mr. Pip,” when I deemed it advisable to go to bed and leave him."
"第二十四章","Chapter 24"
"两三天后，在我已经将房间收拾妥当，往返了伦敦几次，和我的交易商订下我需要的东西之后，鄱凯特先生和我进行了一次长谈。对于我有意发展的方向，他知道的比我自己知道的更多，因为贾格尔斯先生已经告诉他我对我的职业还没有任何打算，如果我能和一般的家境不错的年轻人不相上下的话，我应该接受良好的教育以和我的命运相称。当然，我默许了，也不知道相反的情况会是如何。","After two or three days, when I had established myself in my room and had gone backwards and forwards to London several times, and had ordered all I wanted of my tradesmen, Mr. Pocket and I had a long talk together.He knew more of my intended career than I knew myself, for he referred to his having been told by Mr. Jaggers that I was not designed for any profession, and that I should be well enough educated for my destiny if I could “hold my own” with the average of young men in prosperous circumstances.I acquiesced, of course, knowing nothing to the contrary."
"他建议我去伦敦的一些地方，以获取一些我所需的、起码的知识。同时，他也提议由他自己担任我整个学习过程的讲解人和指导人。他希望在他明智的帮助下，我能够一帆风顺，而且能很快就无需除他以外的任何帮助。因为他说这番话的方式，更因为我们的目的一致，他很好地和我保持了秘密的关系。可以说他在履行和我的契约时，总是表现得热心而可敬，也使得我在履行和他的契约的过程中变得热心而可敬。如果他作为导师表现出冷漠，那么我作为学生，也照样冷漠地回敬他；他没有给我这样的借口，我们各自对对方都是公平的。在他作为导师和我交流的过程中，我也从不认为他身上有可笑的地方——抑或是除去严肃、诚实和善良以外的特点。","He advised my attending certain places in London, for the acquisition of such mere rudiments as I wanted, and my investing him with the functions of explainer and director of all my studies.He hoped that with intelligent assistance I should meet with little to discourage me, and should soon be able to dispense with any aid but his.Through his way of saying this, and much more to similar purpose, he placed himself on confidential terms with me in an admirable manner; and I may state at once that he was always so zealous and honorable in fulfilling his compact with me, that he made me zealous and honorable in fulfilling mine with him.If he had shown indifference as a master, I have no doubt I should have returned the compliment as a pupil; he gave me no such excuse, and each of us did the other justice.Nor, did I ever regard him as having anything ludicrous about him—or anything but what was serious, honest, and good—in his tutor communication with me."
"这几点一经确定，并已得到落实，我就开始认真工作了。我想，我应该保留我在巴纳德旅馆的那间房子，我的生活将变得丰富多彩，而我的行为并不会因受到赫伯特的交际圈的影响而变得更差。鄱凯特先生没有反对这样的安排，但是他敦促我在将任何打算付诸实践之前，都必须先请示我的监护人。我觉得这一考虑体现了他的细心，那个计划会为赫伯特省下一些开销，因此我去了小不列颠街，将我的意愿讲给贾格尔斯先生听。","When these points were settled, and so far carried out as that I had begun to work in earnest, it occurred to me that if I could retain my bedroom in Barnard’s Inn, my life would be agreeably varied, while my manners would be none the worse for Herbert’s society.Mr. Pocket did not object to this arrangement, but urged that before any step could possibly be taken in it, it must be submitted to my guardian.I felt that this delicacy arose out of the consideration that the plan would save Herbert some expense, so I went off to Little Britain and imparted my wish to Mr. Jaggers."
"“要是我能买下现在给我租的那些家具，”我说，“还有一两件小物件，我在那里就会住得很舒服了。”","“If I could buy the furniture now hired for me,” said I, “and one or two other little things, I should be quite at home there.”"
"“去吧！”贾格尔斯先生笑了一下，说道，“我告诉过你开销会变大的。那么，你要多少钱？”","“Go it!” said Mr. Jaggers, with a short laugh.“I told you you’d get on.Well!How much do you want?”"
"我说我不知道要多少钱。","I said I didn’t know how much."
"“嗨！”贾格尔斯先生反驳道，“多少钱？五十镑？”","“Come!” retorted Mr. Jaggers. “How much?Fifty pounds?”"
"“哦，不用那么多。”","“Oh, not nearly so much.”"
"“五镑？”贾格尔斯先生说。","“Five pounds?” said Mr. Jaggers."
"落差也太大了，我尴尬地说：“哦！再多一点。”","This was such a great fall, that I said in discomfiture, “Oh! more than that.”"
"“多一点，哼！”贾格尔斯先生反驳道，“多多少？”他两手插在口袋里，头歪在一边，眼睛盯着我后面的墙，等着我说话。","“More than that, eh!” retorted Mr. Jaggers, lying in wait for me, with his hands in his pockets, his head on one side, and his eyes on the wall behind me; “how much more?”"
"“很难说个确定的数字。”我犹豫地说。","“It is so difficult to fix a sum,” said I, hesitating."
"“哦！”贾格尔斯先生说，“我们来算一算。两个五镑，够不够？三个五镑，够不够？四个五镑，够不够？”","“Come!” said Mr. Jaggers. “Let’s get at it.Twice five; will that do?Three times five; will that do?Four times five; will that do?”"
"我说我想已经很充裕了。","I said I thought that would do handsomely."
"“四个五镑足够了，是不是？”贾格尔斯先生皱着眉头说，“那么，你说四个五镑是多少？”","“Four times five will do handsomely, will it?” said Mr. Jaggers, knitting his brows. “Now, what do you make of four times five?”"
"“是多少？”","“What do I make of it?”"
"“啊！”贾格尔斯先生说，“是多少？”","“Ah!” said Mr. Jaggers; “how much?”"
"“我想你说的是二十镑。”我笑着说。","“I suppose you make it twenty pounds,” said I, smiling."
"“别管我说的是多少，我的朋友。”贾格尔斯先生说——他在故意摇头使诈，“我想知道你说的是多少。”","“Never mind what I make it, my friend,” observed Mr. Jaggers, with a knowing and contradictory toss of his head.“I want to know what you make it.”"
"“当然是二十镑。”","“Twenty pounds, of course.”"
"“温米克！”贾格尔斯先生说着，打开了他办公室的门，“让皮普先生写一张收据，然后付给他二十镑。”","“Wemmick!” said Mr. Jaggers, opening his office door.“Take Mr. Pip’s written order, and pay him twenty pounds.”"
"这种非常特别的做事方式给我留下了深刻的印象，而且是令人不快的印象。贾格尔斯先生从来不笑，但是他穿着巨大、锃亮且吱吱作响的靴子，他镇静地踩着这双靴子，硕大的脑袋耷拉下来，眉毛纠在了一起，等待着答复，他有时会让靴子发出响声，像是带着怀疑的干笑。现在他正好要出门，温米克则活泼而健谈。我对温米克说，我根本摸不清楚贾格尔斯先生的行为风格。","This strongly marked way of doing business made a strongly marked impression on me, and that not of an agreeable kind.Mr. Jaggers never laughed; but he wore great bright creaking boots, and, in poising himself on these boots, with his large head bent down and his eyebrows joined together, awaiting an answer, he sometimes caused the boots to creak, as if they laughed in a dry and suspicious way.As he happened to go out now, and as Wemmick was brisk and talkative, I said to Wemmick that I hardly knew what to make of Mr. Jaggers’ manner."
"“你说给他听啊，他还会觉得这是赞扬他的话呢。”温米克回答说，“他不是一定要你算出来是多少。”“哦！”因为我看上去非常惊讶，他接着说：“并非个人原因，这是职业要求，只是职业要求而已。”","“Tell him that, and he’ll take it as a compliment,” answered Wemmick; “he don’t mean that you should know what to make of it.”“—Oh!” for I looked surprised, “it’s not personal; it’s professional: only professional.”"
"温米克坐在他的桌子旁边，吃着午饭，嚼着一块又干又硬的饼干。他把饼干一片一片地扔进他又细又长的嘴里，就好像把信扔进邮筒一样。","Wemmick was at his desk, lunching—and crunching—on a dry hard biscuit; pieces of which he threw from time to time into his slit of a mouth, as if he were posting them."
"“在我看来，”温米克说，“他好像设了一个陷阱，然后一直在旁边监视着。突然——咔嚓——你就陷进去了！”","“Always seems to me,” said Wemmick, “as if he had set a mantrap and was watching it.Suddenly—click—you’re caught!”"
"我没有说这个陷阱令我很不愉快，我说我想他是个很精明的人了？","Without remarking that mantraps were not among the amenities of life, I said I supposed he was very skilful?"
"“城府真深，”温米克说，“就像澳大利亚一样深。”为了比喻的目的，他用笔尖指着地板，表明澳大利亚在地理位置上来说，正好是在地球的另一端。“要是还有谁城府比比澳大利亚更深的话，”温米克把笔放回纸上，又说道，“就非他莫属。”","“Deep,” said Wemmick, “as Australia.”Pointing with his pen at the office floor, to express that Australia was understood, for the purposes of the figure, to be symmetrically on the opposite spot of the globe.“If there was anything deeper,” added Wemmick, bringing his pen to paper, “he’d be it.”"
"之后，我说我猜他的生意一定很好，温米克说：“非——常——棒！”之后我问这里的职员多不多。他回答说：","Then, I said I supposed he had a fine business, and Wemmick said, “Ca-pi-tal!”Then I asked if there were many clerks? to which he replied:"
"“我们没有很多职员，因为只有一个贾格尔斯，而人们又不愿意通过中间人联系他。我们只有四个人。你想见见他们吗？我应该这样说，你也是我们的一员。”","“We don’t run much into clerks, because there’s only one Jaggers, and people won’t have him at second-hand.There are only four of us.Would you like to see ’em?You are one of us, as I may say.”"
"我接受了他的邀请。温米克先生把所有的饼干都投进他的邮筒口嘴巴之后，他从保险箱的钱库中取了钱给我。他把保险箱钥匙放在自己背上的某处，它从大衣领中伸出来就像个铁尾巴一样，然后我们上了楼。房子又暗又旧，从贾格尔斯先生房间里留下的那些沾满油污的肩膀印来看，这些人已经在楼梯上上下下好多年了。在二楼靠前的地方，有一位看上去介于酒店老板和捕鼠者之间的人——脸色苍白、身体臃肿——在专心接待三四个衣衫褴褛的人。他像接待其他人一样态度随便，而这些人都为贾格尔斯先生的保险箱做过贡献。我们出来时，温米克先生说道，“那些是在为中央刑事法庭收集证据。”","I accepted the offer.When Mr. Wemmick had put all the biscuit into the post, and had paid me my money from a cash-box in a safe, the key of which safe he kept somewhere down his back and produced from his coat-collar like an iron pigtail, we went up-stairs.The house was dark and shabby, and the greasy shoulders that had left their mark in Mr. Jaggers’ room, seemed to have been shuffling up and down the staircase for years.In the front first floor, a clerk who looked something between a publican and a rat-catcher—a large pale puffed swollen man—was attentively engaged with three or four people of shabby appearance, whom he treated as unceremoniously as everybody seemed to be treated who contributed to Mr. Jaggers’ coffers.“Getting evidence together,” said Mr. Wemmick, as we came out, “for the Bailey.”"
"那边过去那个房间里有一只一位职员养的猎狐狗，它软弱无力、毛发悬垂着（就像是它还是幼犬的时候就没剪过毛发），也在接待一个弱视的人。温米克先生向我介绍说他是一个熔炼工，而且整天开着他的熔炉，他可以为我熔化任何我想要熔化东西——而且他汗腺旺盛，就像要把他自己也献给他的熔炉艺术似的。在后边的屋子里，有一位耸着肩膀的男士，他因为面部神经痛而绑着一块脏兮兮的法兰绒布。他穿了一身旧的黑色衣服，衣服好像上了一层蜡似的。此时他正弯着腰为贾格尔斯先生复印另外两位先生的记录。","In the room over that, a little flabby terrier of a clerk with dangling hair (his cropping seemed to have been forgotten when he was a puppy) was similarly engaged with a man with weak eyes, whom Mr. Wemmick presented to me as a smelter who kept his pot always boiling, and who would melt me anything I pleased—and who was in an excessive white-perspiration, as if he had been trying his art on himself.In a back room, a high-shouldered man with a face-ache tied up in dirty flannel, who was dressed in old black clothes that bore the appearance of having been waxed, was stooping over his work of making fair copies of the notes of the other two gentlemen, for Mr. Jaggers’ own use."
"这些就是这个机构的全部。我们又下了楼，温米克让我进了我的监护人的房间，说：“这间屋子你已经见过了。”","This was all the establishment.When we went down-stairs again, Wemmick led me into my guardian’s room, and said, “This you’ve seen already.”"
"“请问，”当我的视线落在两件目露凶光、面目可憎的头像铸件上时，我问，“那边两位是谁？”","“Pray,” said I, as the two odious casts with the twitchy leer upon them caught my sight again, “whose likenesses are those?”"
"“这边两位？”温米克说着，站在一个椅子上，吹了吹两个恐怖头像上的灰尘，将它们拿了下来。“这些是两位著名的人物。这位是我们著名的客户，为我们带来了极大的声誉。这个家伙（你肯定是在半夜偷偷跑下来，把头探进墨水瓶里，弄脏了你的眉毛，你这个老流氓！）谋杀了他的主人。鉴于他没有留下什么证据，他干得不错。”","“These?” said Wemmick, getting upon a chair, and blowing the dust off the horrible heads before bringing them down.“These are two celebrated ones.Famous clients of ours that got us a world of credit.This chap (why you must have come down in the night and been peeping into the inkstand, to get this blot upon your eyebrow, you old rascal!) murdered his master, and, considering that he wasn’t brought up to evidence, didn’t plan it badly.”"
"“这个东西像他吗？”我望着这个残忍的家伙向后退去，同时问道，而温米克却向它的眉毛吐了口吐沫，用袖子擦了擦。","“Is it like him?” I asked, recoiling from the brute, as Wemmick spat upon his eyebrow and gave it a rub with his sleeve."
"“像他？你要知道这个就是他。这个模子就是在纽盖特监狱取的，就在他被处决之后。你对我有特殊的好感，不是吗，你这个狡猾的老东西？”温米克说道。之后他解释了这个亲昵的称呼，他摸了摸他的胸针，上面有一位女士的像，还有坟墓旁的垂柳和上面的骨灰盒，说道：“这个胸针是给我做的，是不是！”","“Like him?It’s himself, you know.The cast was made in Newgate, directly after he was taken down.You had a particular fancy for me, hadn’t you, Old Artful?” said Wemmick. He then explained this affectionate apostrophe, by touching his brooch representing the lady and the weeping willow at the tomb with the urn upon it, and saying, “Had it made for me, express!”"
"“这位女士是你的什么人吗？”我说。","“Is the lady anybody?” said I."
"“不是的，”温米克回答道，“这个只是他的把戏。（你也喜欢你的小把戏，不是吗？）不，一点都不关这个女人的事，皮普先生，除了一个人——而且她也不是那么苗条，那么雍容尔雅的，你也不会看到她看管这个骨灰盒——除非里面装的是饮料。”温米克的注意力由此转移到他的胸针上了。他放下了那个头像，拿出他的手帕擦拭着那枚胸针。","“No,” returned Wemmick.“Only his game.(You liked your bit of game, didn’t you?) No; deuce a bit of a lady in the case, Mr. Pip, except one—and she wasn’t of this slender ladylike sort, and you wouldn’t have caught her looking after this urn—unless there was something to drink in it.”Wemmick’s attention being thus directed to his brooch, he put down the cast, and polished the brooch with his pocket-handkerchief."
"“另一个人也是同样的下场吗？”我问道，“他有着同样的外表。”","“Did that other creature come to the same end?” I asked. “He has the same look.”"
"“你说对了。”温米克说，“这个就是他真正的样子。看起来一个鼻孔里像是粘上了一根马毛和一个小鱼钩。是的，他也是同样的下场。这种下场在这里很平常，我敢肯定。他伪造遗嘱，恐怕还用这个刀片让那位立遗嘱的人从此一睡不醒呢。不过你是个有绅士派头的小子。”（温米克先生又一次用了此类称呼）“你说你能用希腊文写作。哼，没一句真话！你真是个大骗子！我还从没见过你这样的大骗子呢！”在温米克将他第二位朋友放回架子之前，他摸了摸那枚最大的悼念戒指，说：“就在他死的前一天，我还叫他出去给我买这枚戒指呢。”","“You’re right,” said Wemmick; “it’s the genuine look.Much as if one nostril was caught up with a horsehair and a little fish-hook.Yes, he came to the same end; quite the natural end here, I assure you.He forged wills, this blade did, if he didn’t also put the supposed testators to sleep too.You were a gentlemanly Cove, though” (Mr. Wemmick was again apostrophizing), “and you said you could write Greek.Yah, Bounceable!What a liar you were!I never met such a liar as you!”Before putting his late friend on his shelf again, Wemmick touched the largest of his mourning rings and said, “Sent out to buy it for me, only the day before.”"
"在他放回另外一个头像，从椅子上下来的时候，我思忖着他所有的私人珠宝是否都是这样得来的。关于这个话题他没有表现出一点羞怯，我冒昧地问了他这个问题，当时他正站在我面前，拍打着手上的灰尘。","While he was putting up the other cast and coming down from the chair, the thought crossed my mind that all his personal jewellery was derived from like sources.As he had shown no diffidence on the subject, I ventured on the liberty of asking him the question, when he stood before me, dusting his hands."
"“哦，是的。”他回答说，“这些都是诸如此类的礼物。一个接一个，你看见了，事情就是这样。我都会欣然接受。它们都是古玩。它们也都是我的财产。它们可能不值几个钱，但是，它们毕竟都是财产，而且轻便易携带。它们对于你的远大前程来说可能一文不值，但是对于我自己来说，我的座右铭就是‘紧紧抓住可携带的财产’。”","“Oh yes,” he returned, “these are all gifts of that kind.One brings another, you see; that’s the way of it.I always take ’em.They’re curiosities.And they’re property.They may not be worth much, but, after all, they’re property and portable.It don’t signify to you with your brilliant look-out, but as to myself, my guiding-star always is, ‘Get hold of portable property’.”"
"我对他的这番启示表现出敬意，他继续以友好的态度说：","When I had rendered homage to this light, he went on to say, in a friendly manner:"
"“要是你什么时候有空，你若是不介意的话，可以来沃尔沃思看看我，我能给你提供一张床，我也会将此视为我的荣幸的。我没有太多东西给你看，但是像这样的两三件古玩还是有的，你会对它们感兴趣的。我还有一个我非常喜欢的小花园和一座避暑山庄。”","“If at any odd time when you have nothing better to do, you wouldn’t mind coming over to see me at Walworth, I could offer you a bed, and I should consider it an honor.I have not much to show you; but such two or three curiosities as I have got, you might like to look over; and I am fond of a bit of garden and a summer-house.”"
"我说我很乐意接受他的邀请。","I said I should be delighted to accept his hospitality."
"“谢谢。”他说，“我们就这样说定了，你什么时候方便就过来吧。你和贾格尔斯先生吃过饭了吗？”","“Thankee,” said he; “then we’ll consider that it’s to come off, when convenient to you.Have you dined with Mr. Jaggers yet?”"
"“还没有呢。”","“Not yet.”"
"“那么，”温米克说，“他会请你喝葡萄酒的，上等的葡萄酒。我会请你喝宾治酒，不错的宾治酒。现在我要告诉你一些事。在你和贾格尔斯先生吃饭的时候，留心他的女管家。”","“Well,” said Wemmick, “he’ll give you wine, and good wine.I’ll give you punch, and not bad punch.And now I’ll tell you something.When you go to dine with Mr. Jaggers, look at his housekeeper.”"
"“我该留意什么特别的事吗？”","“Shall I see something very uncommon?”"
"“嗯，”温米克说，“你会见到一头被驯服的野兽。你会说也不是特别的不寻常。我会回答，需要看原来这野兽的兽性如何，以及被驯服的程度。这些会让你对贾格尔斯先生的能力另眼相看的。留心观察吧。”","“Well,” said Wemmick, “you’ll see a wild beast tamed.Not so very uncommon, you’ll tell me.I reply, that depends on the original wildness of the beast, and the amount of taming.It won’t lower your opinion of Mr. Jaggers’ powers.Keep your eye on it.”"
"我告诉他我知道了。对于他的忠告，我的内心充满了兴趣和好奇。在我就要离开的时候，他问我是否愿意拿出五分钟一睹贾格尔斯先生工作时的“风采”。","I told him I would do so, with all the interest and curiosity that his preparation awakened.As I was taking my departure, he asked me if I would like to devote five minutes to seeing Mr. Jaggers “at it?”"
"出于多种原因，至少是因为我不太清楚贾格尔斯先生从事的事务，我做出了肯定的回答。我们赶进伦敦金融城，来到了一个拥挤的治安法院。一位生前对胸针有特殊品味的死者的血亲（意指和死者的谋杀有关的人）正站在被告席上，不自在地嚼着什么东西。而我的监护人正在盘问或交叉盘问（我不确定是哪一个）一位妇女，使她、法官和在座的每一位都深感震惊，敬畏之心油然而起。只要那些人说了一句他不赞成的话，不管大小，他都立即要求“记下来”。要是有人否认某事的陈述，他就会说：“我会把你的供词逼出来的！”要是有人承认了，他则说：“我已经逼出了你的供词了！”他只要咬一下手指，地方法官们就浑身抖一下。小偷和捉小偷的人都全神贯注地听着他说的每一个词，而且当他的眉毛尖转向他们的时候，他们都会回避他的目光。我搞不清楚他到底站在哪一边，因为他似乎要把整个地方都磨成碎末。我只知道踮着脚走出去的时候，他正和法官对着干，因为他谴责他的行为不能够代表大英帝国的法律和坐在主审席所维护的公正，把这位主持审判的老先生吓得双腿在桌下直抖。","For several reasons, and not least because I didn’t clearly know what Mr. Jaggers would be found to be “at,” I replied in the affirmative.We dived into the City, and came up in a crowded police-court, where a blood-relation (in the murderous sense) of the deceased with the fanciful taste in brooches, was standing at the bar, uncomfortably chewing something; while my guardian had a woman under examination or cross-examination—I don’t know which—and was striking her, and the bench, and everybody present, with awe.If anybody, of whatsoever degree, said a word that he didn’t approve of, he instantly required to have it “taken down.”If anybody wouldn’t make an admission, he said, “I’ll have it out of you!”And if anybody made an admission, he said, “Now I have got you!”The magistrates shivered under a single bite of his finger.Thieves and thief-takers hung in dread rapture on his words, and shrank when a hair of his eyebrows turned in their direction.Which side he was on, I couldn’t make out, for he seemed to me to be grinding the whole place in a mill; I only know that when I stole out on tiptoe, he was not on the side of the bench; for, he was making the legs of the old gentleman who presided, quite convulsive under the table, by his denunciations of his conduct as the representative of British law and justice in that chair that day."
"第二十五章","Chapter 25"
"本特利·德鲁莫尔是个满脸阴沉的人，就算他拿起一本书，都好像那个作者伤害了他似的。他对认识的人从来都没有一副更愉快一点的脸色。他身形笨重、行动缓慢，思维也很迟钝——这些从他反应迟缓的神情和不灵光的舌头就能看出来。舌头懒洋洋地在他嘴里打转，就像他自己在房间里打转一样——他懒散、骄傲、吝啬、寡言少语却疑心颇重。他来自萨默塞特郡的有钱人家，这样的环境造就了他这样的性格，直到他成年之后，家人才发现他是个傻子。因此，本特利·德鲁莫尔来到了矮他一个头的鄱凯特先生家，而脑筋却转得不及大部分的绅士快。","Bentley Drummle, who was so sulky a fellow that he even took up a book as if its writer had done him an injury, did not take up an acquaintance in a more agreeable spirit.Heavy in figure, movement, and comprehension—in the sluggish complexion of his face, and in the large awkward tongue that seemed to loll about in his mouth as he himself lolled about in a room—he was idle, proud, niggardly, reserved, and suspicious.He came of rich people down in Somersetshire, who had nursed this combination of qualities until they made the discovery that it was just of age and a blockhead.Thus, Bentley Drummle had come to Mr. Pocket when he was a head taller than that gentleman, and half a dozen heads thicker than most gentlemen."
"斯塔特普被他软弱的母亲宠坏了，在他应该上学的年龄，他被留在了家里。但是他非常依恋她，而且极度崇拜她。他有着女人一般精致的五官，而且——根据赫伯特对我所说的，“尽管你从未见到她，但是她就是这个样子”——跟他母亲极其相似。我自然对他比对德鲁莫尔更友善，即便是我们一起划船的最初几晚，我都会和他两船相对，并肩划回去。而本特利·德鲁莫尔独自跟在我们的后面，在高耸的河岸之下、灯芯草丛之中划行。即便潮汐会很快将他送上岸，但他都会像不安的两栖动物一样爬上来。当我们的两只船在河流之中冲破夕阳或月光时，我总是想到他在黑暗中跟着我们，或者是逆流而行。","Startop had been spoilt by a weak mother and kept at home when he ought to have been at school, but he was devotedly attached to her, and admired her beyond measure.He had a woman’s delicacy of feature, and was—“as you may see, though you never saw her,” said Herbert to me—exactly like his mother.It was but natural that I should take to him much more kindly than to Drummle, and that, even in the earliest evenings of our boating, he and I should pull homeward abreast of one another, conversing from boat to boat, while Bentley Drummle came up in our wake alone, under the overhanging banks and among the rushes.He would always creep in-shore like some uncomfortable amphibious creature, even when the tide would have sent him fast upon his way; and I always think of him as coming after us in the dark or by the back-water, when our own two boats were breaking the sunset or the moonlight in mid-stream."
"赫伯特是我的亲密伙伴兼朋友。他经常来哈默史密斯，他过来的时候，我就和他共享我的小船。他也和我共享他的房间，这些让我也经常去伦敦。我们常常在两地之间行走。我对这条路有一种感情（尽管那条路并不像它后来那么舒适），这种感情存在于我涉世未深的青春与希望之中。","Herbert was my intimate companion and friend.I presented him with a half-share in my boat, which was the occasion of his often coming down to Hammersmith; and my possession of a half-share in his chambers often took me up to London.We used to walk between the two places at all hours.I have an affection for the road yet (though it is not so pleasant a road as it was then), formed in the impressibility of untried youth and hope."
"我在鄱凯特先生家住了一两个月之后，卡米拉先生和太太出现了。卡米拉是鄱凯特先生的妹妹。乔治亚娜也来了，我在郝维仙小姐家的同样场合见过她一次。她是一位表妹——消化系统有些问题的单身女人。她把自己的固执称为宗教信仰，把自己的肝脏称为爱人。这些人出于对贪婪的憎恶和失望，对我很是厌恶。当然，他们自然会以最卑贱的方式奉承我的飞黄腾达。他们对鄱凯特先生这位长大成人却对自己的利益毫无概念的婴儿，表现出了超强忍耐力，这点我已经听他们夸耀过了。他们非常轻视鄱凯特太太，但是他们承认这个可怜的人对生活非常失望，因为这也微微映射出他们自己的生活状态。","When I had been in Mr. Pocket’s family a month or two, Mr. and Mrs. Camilla turned up.Camilla was Mr. Pocket’s sister.Georgiana, whom I had seen at Miss Havisham’s on the same occasion, also turned up.She was a cousin—an indigestive single woman, who called her rigidity religion, and her liver love.These people hated me with the hatred of cupidity and disappointment.As a matter of course, they fawned upon me in my prosperity with the basest meanness.Towards Mr. Pocket, as a grown-up infant with no notion of his own interests, they showed the complacent forbearance I had heard them express.Mrs. Pocket they held in contempt; but they allowed the poor soul to have been heavily disappointed in life, because that shed a feeble reflected light upon themselves."
"以上就是我居住的环境，我在这里接受着教育。很快我就养成了一些昂贵的习惯，短短几个月里，我花了一大笔钱，在我之前看来就是一笔天文数字。但是不管其他好坏，我还是坚持读书了。除了让我意识到自己知识欠缺之外，读书也没有其他好处了。由于鄱凯特先生和赫伯特的帮助，我进步得很快。每当我想着手做一件事的时候，他们两个中总会有一个人来帮我一把，为我清除道路上的障碍，要是这样我都没看出来的话，我就成了德鲁莫尔那样的傻子了。","These were the surroundings among which I settled down, and applied myself to my education.I soon contracted expensive habits, and began to spend an amount of money that within a few short months I should have thought almost fabulous; but through good and evil I stuck to my books.There was no other merit in this, than my having sense enough to feel my deficiencies.Between Mr. Pocket and Herbert I got on fast; and, with one or the other always at my elbow to give me the start I wanted, and clear obstructions out of my road, I must have been as great a dolt as Drummle if I had done less."
"我几个星期都没有见到温米克先生了，我想我应该给他写一张纸条，提议在某个晚和他一起回家。他回复说很乐意这样做，并且说他六点在律师事务所等我。我去了那里，也看到了他，就在钟表敲响六下的时候，当时他正把他的保险柜钥匙放回他的背上。","I had not seen Mr. Wemmick for some weeks, when I thought I would write him a note and propose to go home with him on a certain evening.He replied that it would give him much pleasure, and that he would expect me at the office at six o’clock.Thither I went, and there I found him, putting the key of his safe down his back as the clock struck."
"“你想走回沃尔沃思吗？”他说。","“Did you think of walking down to Walworth?” said he. "
"“当然，”我说，“要是你同意的话。”","“Certainly,” said I, “if you approve.”"
"“非常愿意。”温米克回答道，“我已经坐在这里一整天了，应该伸展伸展我的腿了。现在，我要告诉你我们晚饭吃什么，皮普先生。首先是焖牛排——是自己家里做的——然后还有冷烤鸡——这个是在饭店里买的。我觉得它很嫩，因为那家店的大厨是前几天我们一些案件的陪审员，我们让他舒舒服服地过了那几天。在我买鸡的时候，我提醒他说：‘给我们挑一个好一点的，老伙计，要是我们想选你在陪审席上多留几天的话，我们早就可以轻轻松松地办到了。’他回答说：‘我来给你挑一个我们店里最好的鸡。’当然，我让他挑了。就目前来说，这个就是财富，而且易于携带。我希望你不会抗拒一位年迈的父亲吧？”","“Very much,” was Wemmick’s reply, “for I have had my legs under the desk all day, and shall be glad to stretch them.Now, I’ll tell you what I have got for supper, Mr. Pip.I have got a stewed steak—which is of home preparation—and a cold roast fowl—which is from the cook’s-shop.I think it’s tender, because the master of the shop was a Juryman in some cases of ours the other day, and we let him down easy.I reminded him of it when I bought the fowl, and I said, “Pick us out a good one, old Briton, because if we had chosen to keep you in the box another day or two, we could easily have done it.”He said to that, “Let me make you a present of the best fowl in the shop.”I let him, of course.As far as it goes, it’s property and portable.You don’t object to an aged parent, I hope?”"
"我真的以为他还在说那只鸡，直到他又说道：“因为我家里有一位年迈的父亲。”然后我问我需要遵守什么样的礼节。","I really thought he was still speaking of the fowl, until he added, “Because I have got an aged parent at my place.”I then said what politeness required."
"“那么，你还没有和贾格尔斯先生吃过饭了？”我们往前走的时候，他追问道。","“So, you haven’t dined with Mr. Jaggers yet?” he pursued, as we walked along."
"“还没有。”","“Not yet.”"
"“下午他听说你要来的时候已经告诉我了。我想你明天就会接到他的邀请的。他也会邀请你的伙伴的。有三个人，是不是？”","“He told me so this afternoon when he heard you were coming.I expect you’ll have an invitation tomorrow.He’s going to ask your pals, too.Three of ’em; ain’t there?”"
"尽管我还不习惯将德鲁莫尔当成我的一个密友，但我依然回答说：“是的。”","Although I was not in the habit of counting Drummle as one of my intimate associates, I answered, “Yes.”"
"“那么，他会邀请你们全部这伙人的。”这话让我感到不甚合适，“而且不论他拿什么招待你们，那一定是好东西。别指望种类会太多，但一定是好东西。还有，在他家里有另一件奇特的事，”温米克停了一下，我想好像他接下来的话要提及那个管家，之后他继续说道，“他晚上从来不锁门或窗户。”","“Well, he’s going to ask the whole gang;” I hardly felt complimented by the word; “and whatever he gives you, he’ll give you good.Don’t look forward to variety, but you’ll have excellence.And there’sa nother rum thing in his house,” proceeded Wemmick, after a moment’s pause, as if the remark followed on the housekeeper understood; “he never lets a door or window be fastened at night.”"
"“他家没有被盗过吗？”","“Is he never robbed?”"
"“关键就在这里！”温米克回答说，“他说过，而且是在大庭广众之下说：‘我想见识一下敢偷我东西的家伙。’我的主啊，我听他说过，而且听他说过上百次，他在我们前面的办公室对那些惯偷们说：‘你们知道我住在哪里，我家也从来不上插销，你们为什么不跟我做一次买卖呢？来吧，我还诱惑不了你们吗？’先生，无论如何，他们之中没有一个人敢去试一下。”","“That’s it!” returned Wemmick. “He says, and gives it out publicly, “I want to see the man who’ll rob me.”Lord bless you, I have heard him, a hundred times if I have heard him once, say to regular cracksmen in our front office, “You know where I live; now, no bolt is ever drawn there; why don’t you do a stroke of business with me?Come; can’t I tempt you?”Not a man of them, sir, would be bold enough to try it on, for love or money.”"
"“他们就那么害怕他？”我说。","“They dread him so much?” said I."
"“害怕他，”温米克说，“我相信你，他们是害怕他。这个只是他的诡计，他蔑视他们。他家没有银器，先生。每个勺子都是大不列颠合金的。”","“Dread him,” said Wemmick.“I believe you they dread him.Not but what he’s artful, even in his defiance of them.No silver, sir.Britannia metal, every spoon.”"
"“所以那些东西也值不了几个钱，”我说道，“就算他们敢——”","“So they wouldn’t have much,” I observed, “even if they—”"
"“啊！但是他赚的就大了，”温米克打断我说，“而且他们知道这一点。他们的命就握在他的手里了，而且是他们几十条人命。他则能得到所有他想要的东西。而且要是他上了心了，没有什么东西是他得不到的。”","“Ah!But he would have much,” said Wemmick, cutting me short, “and they know it.He’d have their lives, and the lives of scores of ’em.He’d have all he could get.And it’s impossible to say what he couldn’t get, if he gave his mind to it.”"
"我正沉浸在对我监护人之伟大的思考之中，这时温米克说：","I was falling into meditation on my guardian’s greatness, when Wemmick remarked:"
"“至于他家没有金银餐具，这个只是他与生俱来的高深，你知道的。一条河天然就有其深度，他也有天生的高深。看看他的表链。那个可是货真价实的东西。”","“As to the absence of plate, that’s only his natural depth, you know.A river’s its natural depth, and he’s his natural depth.Look at his watch-chain.That’s real enough.”"
"“那条链子确实很粗。”我说。","“It’s very massive,” said I."
"“很粗？”温米克重复道，“我也是这样觉得。而且他的表也是纯金的，要说那条链子值一便士的话，那表就值一百镑。皮普先生，这个城里大概有七百个小偷知道这块表。每一个男人、女人甚至小孩子都能认出这表链上最小的链环，要是谁被骗着碰了它一下，他都会像摸到烧红的金属一样立马扔掉。”","“Massive?” repeated Wemmick. “I think so.And his watch is a gold repeater, and worth a hundred pound if it’s worth a penny.Mr. Pip, there are about seven hundred thieves in this town who know all about that watch; there’s not a man, a woman, or a child, among them, who wouldn’t identify the smallest link in that chain, and drop it as if it was red-hot, if inveigled into touching it.”"
"一开始我们就谈论了这些，之后我们对话所涉及的话题就更普遍一些了。我和温米克先生在路上就这样消磨时间，直到他告诉我，我们已经到了沃尔沃思区。","At first with such discourse, and afterwards with conversation of a more general nature, did Mr. Wemmick and I beguile the time and the road, until he gave me to understand that we had arrived in the district of Walworth."
"这个区似乎聚集着很多背路的小巷、沟渠和小花园，以此来展现其相当晦暗、隐蔽的一面。温米克的房子是一座木制的小别墅，坐落在一片花园的中间。房子的顶部被打平，漆成好像放着枪炮的炮台一样。","It appeared to be a collection of back lanes, ditches, and little gardens, and to present the aspect of a rather dull retirement.Wemmick’s house was a little wooden cottage in the midst of plots of garden, and the top of it was cut out and painted like a battery mounted with guns."
"“我自己的杰作。”温米克说，“看上去很漂亮，不是吗？”","“My own doing,” said Wemmick.“Looks pretty; don’t it?”"
"我高度称赞了他的杰作，我想这里是我见到过的最小的房子了。还有奇怪的哥特式的窗户（目前它们中很大一部分都是虚饰），还有一扇哥特式的门，小得几乎让人进不去。","I highly commended it, I think it was the smallest house I ever saw; with the queerest gothic windows (by far the greater part of them sham), and a gothic door, almost too small to get in at."
"“这个是真的旗杆，你看，”温米克说，“每到星期日的时候我都会升起一面真正的旗帜。然后再看看这座桥。在我过了桥之后，我就把它吊起来——所以——就可以与外界断绝联系。”","“That’s a real flagstaff, you see,” said Wemmick, “and on Sundays I run up a real flag.Then look here.After I have crossed this bridge, I hoist it up—so—and cut off the communication.”"
"这座桥就是一块厚木板，它架在一个四英尺宽、两英尺厚的深坑上。看到他骄傲地把桥升起来，再将其栓紧，倒是一件愉快的事。他一边笑一边干着，看起来干得津津有味的，而不只是机械地干活。","The bridge was a plank, and it crossed a chasm about four feet wide and two deep.But it was very pleasant to see the pride with which he hoisted it up and made it fast; smiling as he did so, with a relish and not merely mechanically."
"“在格林尼治时间每晚九点，”温米克说，“炮声就会响起。就在那里，你看！当你听到炮响的时候，我想你会说那个真是烈性子的家伙。”","“At nine o’clock every night, Greenwich time,” said Wemmick, “the gun fires.There he is, you see!And when you hear him go, I think you’ll say he’s a Stinger.”"
"他所指的那件兵器，就安在一个单独的堡垒上面，那堡垒是用栅格砌成的。上面很巧妙地搭着一小块防水油布，作为这门炮的雨伞，保护其免遭风吹雨淋。","The piece of ordnance referred to, was mounted in a separate fortress, constructed of lattice-work.It was protected from the weather by an ingenious little tarpaulin contrivance in the nature of an umbrella."
"“然后，在后面，”温米克说，“在看不见的地方，以免妨碍我筑城术的理念——因为这个就是我的原则，要是你有想法，就要付诸实践，并坚持下去——我不知道你是否认同——”","“Then, at the back,” said Wemmick, “out of sight, so as not to impede the idea of fortifications—for it’s a principle with me, if you have an idea, carry it out and keep it up—I don’t know whether that’s your opinion—”"
"我说我十分同意。","I said, decidedly."
"“——在那里的后面，有一头猪，还有家禽和兔子。然后，我自己搭建了一个小菜棚，你看，种了一点黄瓜。你在晚餐的时候就能试一下我用我种出来的东西做成的沙拉了。那么，先生，”温米克说，他摇着头，又严肃地笑了笑，“设想一下，要是这一小块地方被包围了，就供给而言，我们也可以熬上相当长的一段时间。”","“—At the back, there’s a pig, and there are fowls and rabbits; then, I knock together my own little frame, you see, and grow cucumbers; and you’ll judge at supper what sort of a salad I can raise.So, sir,” said Wemmick, smiling again, but seriously too, as he shook his head, “if you can suppose the little place besieged, it would hold out a devil of a time in point of provisions.”"
"之后，他带我去了大约十二码之外的一个凉亭，但通往凉亭的小径却设计得弯弯曲曲，我们花了相当长的时间才到了那里。而在这个隐蔽的地方，我们的酒杯已经摆好了。我们的宾治酒在一个装饰性的湖中冷却，凉亭就建在湖边。这一片水域（中间有一个小岛，可能是为晚饭准备的沙拉）呈圆形，他还在上面建了一个喷泉。当你转动水磨，打开水管上的木塞时，那眼喷泉能喷射到很大的范围，以至于能把你的手背弄湿。","Then, he conducted me to a bower about a dozen yards off, but which was approached by such ingenious twists of path that it took quite a long time to get at; and in this retreat our glasses were already set forth.Our punch was cooling in an ornamental lake, on whose margin the bower was raised.This piece of water (with an island in the middle which might have been the salad for supper) was of a circular form, and he had constructed a fountain in it, which, when you set a little mill going and took a cork out of a pipe, played to that powerful extent that it made the back of your hand quite wet."
"“我就是我自己的工程师、木匠、水管工、园丁，以及干一切活计的工人。”温米克说道，以答谢我对他的称赞。“嗯，这事情是一件好事，你知道。它可以扫去纽盖特监狱的蜘蛛网，也可以取悦老人家。你不介意我现在向你介绍我家的老人吧，介意吗？这点不会惹你厌烦吧？”","“I am my own engineer, and my own carpenter, and my own plumber, and my own gardener, and my own Jack of all Trades,” said Wemmick, in acknowledging my compliments.“Well; it’s a good thing, you know.It brushes the Newgate cobwebs away, and pleases the Aged.You wouldn’t mind being at once introduced to the Aged, would you?It wouldn’t put you out?”"
"我向他表明，我已经准备好见老人家了，然后我们就进了城堡。在那里，我们见到一位年龄很大的老人。他穿着法兰绒外套，坐在壁炉旁边：他看上去干净、愉快、舒服，而且得到了很好的照顾，不过却非常耳背。","I expressed the readiness I felt, and we went into the castle.There, we found, sitting by a fire, a very old man in a flannel coat: clean, cheerful, comfortable, and well cared for, but intensely deaf."
"“我年迈的父亲，”温米克说着，和他热情而又诙谐地握了握手，“您怎么样？”","“Well aged parent,” said Wemmick, shaking hands with him in a cordial and jocose way, “how am you?”"
"“很好，约翰，很好！”老人回答道。","“All right, John; all right!” replied the old man. "
"“这位是皮普先生，老父亲。”温米克说，“我希望您能听见他的名字。和他点点头，皮普先生，他喜欢这样。要是你愿意的话，就和他点点头，就像眨眼一样！”","“Here’s Mr. Pip, aged parent,” said Wemmick, “and I wish you could hear his name.Nod away at him, Mr. Pip; that’s what he likes.Nod away at him, if you please, like winking!”"
"“这里是我儿子的一块好地方，先生。”老人喊道，我也用力向他点头。“这里是一个很好的游乐场，先生。在我儿子走了之后，这片地方和这些美妙的作品都应该让国家好好保护，以供人们游玩。”","“This is a fine place of my son’s, sir,” cried the old man, while I nodded as hard as I possibly could.“This is a pretty pleasure-ground, sir.This spot and these beautiful works upon it ought to be kept together by the Nation, after my son’s time, for the people’s enjoyment.”"
"“您对这块地方感到非常骄傲，是不是，老父亲？”温米克说，他凝视着这位老人，僵硬的脸真正地放松了下来，“我来给你点点头，”于是向他用力点了一下头，“再给你点一下头，”说着又向他用力点了点头，“你很喜欢这样点头，是不是？要是你不累的话，皮普先生——尽管我知道这样对陌生人来说是很累的——你能不能再向他点点头？你无法想象这样会让他有多高兴。”","“You’re as proud of it as Punch; ain’t you, Aged?” said Wemmick, contemplating the old man, with his hard face really softened; “there’s a nod for you;” giving him a tremendous one; “there’s another for you;” giving him a still more tremendous one; “you like that, don’t you?If you’re not tired, Mr. Pip—though I know it’s tiring to strangers—will you tip him one more?You can’t think how it pleases him.”"
"我又向他点了好几下头，他则显得很高兴。我们让他在那里忙着喂家禽，而我们则在凉亭坐下，喝我们的宾治酒。温米克一边吸着烟斗，一边告诉我他花了好几年时间将这片产业打理得接近完美。","I tipped him several more, and he was in great spirits.We left him bestirring himself to feed the fowls, and we sat down to our punch in the arbor; where Wemmick told me as he smoked a pipe that it had taken him a good many years to bring the property up to its present pitch of perfection."
"“这里是你自己的吗，温米克先生？”","“Is it your own, Mr. Wemmick?”"
"“哦，是的。”温米克说，“我拥有这片地方，是一次一点慢慢得来的。这些是以乔治的名义拥有的不动产！”","“O yes,” said Wemmick, “I have got hold of it, a bit at a time.It’s a freehold, by George!”"
"“真的吗？我想贾格尔斯先生也很羡慕这片土地吧？”","“Is it, indeed?I hope Mr. Jaggers admires it?”"
"“他从来没有见过。”温米克说，“也从来没有听说过。他没有见过我的老父亲。也从来没有听说过他。不，律师事务所是一回事，私人生活是另外一回事。当我在律师事务所的时候，我就会将这座城堡置之脑后，但当我回到这里的时候，我就将律师事务所置之脑后。要是这样没有令你不愉快的话，请你也这样做。我不希望谈及任何公事。”","“Never seen it,” said Wemmick.“Never heard of it.Never seen the Aged.Never heard of him.No; the office is one thing, and private life is another.When I go into the office, I leave the Castle behind me, and when I come into the Castle, I leave the office behind me.If it’s not in any way disagreeable to you, you’ll oblige me by doing the same.I don’t wish it professionally spoken about.”"
"我当然会真诚地遵守他的要求。宾治酒非常好喝，我们就坐在那里，一边喝酒，一边聊天，一直到将近九点。“快到炮响时间了。”温米克放下烟斗，说，“这是老人宴请客人的方式。”","Of course I felt my good faith involved in the observance of his request.The punch being very nice, we sat there drinking it and talking, until it was almost nine o’clock.“Getting near gun-fire,” said Wemmick then, as he laid down his pipe; “it’s the Aged’s treat.”"
"我们又回到了城堡，发现老人家正在加热拔火棍，眼神里充满了期待，就像在为一次伟大的晚间盛典表演做准备一样。温米克拿着表站在一边，直到那一刻到来的时候，他从老人手里拿过烧红的拔火棍，向炮台走去。他拿着拔火棍走了出去，不久之后就听见大炮发出一声巨大的“嘣”声，响声把原本就不怎么安全的小村舍震得摇摇欲坠，每一扇玻璃和每一个茶杯都在震颤。听到炮响，老人——我想他要不是用肘撑着，早已被震得弹出他的扶手椅了——他兴高采烈地喊着：“炮响了！我听见了！”我一个劲地向这位老先生点头，直到他确定我肯定是听见他的话了。","Proceeding into the Castle again, we found the Aged heating the poker, with expectant eyes, as a preliminary to the performance of this great nightly ceremony.Wemmick stood with his watch in his hand, until the moment was come for him to take the red-hot poker from the Aged, and repair to the battery.He took it, and went out, and presently the Stinger went off with a Bang that shook the crazy little box of a cottage as if it must fall to pieces, and made every glass and teacup in it ring.Upon this, the Aged—who I believe would have been blown out of his arm-chair but for holding on by the elbows—cried out exultingly, “He’s fired!I heerd him!”And I nodded at the old gentleman until it is no figure of speech to declare that I absolutely could not see him."
"在炮声过后和晚饭之前的这段时间里，温米克则专心地向我展示他收藏的珍稀古玩。他大部分的收藏看起来都带着邪恶的特点。其中包括一支曾经写下过著名的伪造文件的笔，一两个有名的剃刀，几撮头发，还有几份在行刑之前写下的认罪的手稿——温米克先生特别珍惜这些手稿，用他的话来说，“其中的每一份手稿都在撒谎，先生。”这些东西恰到好处地散落在一些瓷器和玻璃的标本中间，这些各式各样的小东西被这博物馆的拥有者收拾得井井有条，其中还有一些老人雕刻的烟塞。这些东西都陈列在城堡的这个房间里，这就是一开始接待我的那个房间，不仅作为一般的起居室，而且当厨房用，因为我看到了铁架上的炖锅，还有壁炉上方用来挂烤叉转动器的小东西。","The interval between that time and supper, Wemmick devoted to showing me his collection of curiosities.They were mostly of a felonious character; comprising the pen with which a celebrated forgery had been committed, a distinguished razor or two, some locks of hair, and several manuscript confessions written under condemnation—upon which Mr. Wemmick set particular value as being, to use his own words, “every one of ’em Lies, sir.”These were agreeably dispersed among small specimens of china and glass, various neat trifles made by the proprietor of the museum, and some tobacco-stoppers carved by the Aged.They were all displayed in that chamber of the Castle into which I had been first inducted, and which served, not only as the general sitting-room but as the kitchen too, if I might judge from a saucepan on the hob, and a brazen bijou over the fireplace designed for the suspension of a roasting-jack."
"这里由一个穿戴得整整齐齐的小姑娘打理着，她负责在白天照顾老人。在她把桌布铺好之后，吊桥就放了下来，好让她出去，她在晚上就回去了。晚餐非常丰盛。尽管城堡里有一股干枯的味道，闻起来就像是坏了的干果，而且不远处可能还喂养着一头猪，但我对这样的盛情款待感到由衷的欣喜。我的塔楼卧室里也几乎没有任何缺点。唯一的缺点就是我和旗杆之间只隔着非常薄的天花板，当我平躺在床上的时候，天花板看起来就像我整晚都要平衡那根我前额上的杆子一样。","There was a neat little girl in attendance, who looked after the Aged in the day.When she had laid the supper-cloth, the bridge was lowered to give her means of egress, and she withdrew for the night.The supper was excellent; and though the Castle was rather subject to dry-rot insomuch that it tasted like a bad nut, and though the pig might have been farther off, I was heartily pleased with my whole entertainment.Nor was there any drawback on my little turret bedroom, beyond there being such a very thin ceiling between me and the flagstaff, that when I lay down on my back in bed, it seemed as if I had to balance that pole on my forehead all night."
"温米克早上起得很早，恐怕我都听到他清洗我靴子的声音了。之后，他就到花园里干活去了，透过我哥特式的窗户，我看到他一面假装要老人来帮忙，一面向他连连点头。我们的早餐和晚餐一样丰盛，八点半整的时候，我们动身去小不列颠街。渐渐地，随着我们一路走来，温米克变得越来越冷淡、僵硬，他的嘴最终又绷成了邮筒口。最后，当我们到了他的办公室的时候，他从衣领中掏出了他的钥匙。他看起来对他在沃尔沃思的产业毫无意识，就好像那座城堡、那个吊桥、凉亭、湖和喷泉，还有老人，都随着最后那声炮响而被吹散在空气之中了。","Wemmick was up early in the morning, and I am afraid I heard him cleaning my boots.After that, he fell to gardening, and I saw him from my gothic window pretending to employ the Aged, and nodding at him in a most devoted manner.Our breakfast was as good as the supper, and at half-past eight precisely we started for Little Britain.By degrees, Wemmick got dryer and harder as we went along, and his mouth tightened into a post-office again.At last, when we got to his place of business and he pulled out his key from his coat-collar, he looked as unconscious of his Walworth property as if the Castle and the drawbridge and the arbor and the lake and the fountain and the Aged, had all been blown into space together by the last discharge of the Stinger."
"第二十六章","Chapter 26"
"事情的发展正如温米克告诉我的一样，我一大早就有了一个机会，能让我将我的监护人的房子和他出纳兼办事员的房子做一下比较。当我从沃尔沃思走进我的监护人的办公室时，他正在用香皂洗手。他让我走近他，并且向我和我的朋友发出邀请，这份邀请和温米克所说的一模一样。“不要太隆重，”他规定说，“也不要穿礼服，我们就定在明天吧。”我问他我们应该去哪里（因为我不知道他住在哪里），而且我认为他的一大缺点就是把什么事都当做是在招供，他回答说：“过来这里，我带你回家。”我要抓住这个机会评论一下，每当他打发走一个客人，他都要洗手，就好像他是一位外科医生或者牙科医生一样。在他房间里有一个壁橱，就是为此原因而设，那块香皂闻起来就像是走进了一间香水店一样。挂在门上的是一条放在滚筒上的、又长又大的毛巾，每次他洗完手，就会在这条毛巾上擦干，不管是从治安法院出来或是把一个客户打发出去，他都要洗手。第二天六点，在我和我的朋友到他那里去的时候，他正忙于一件官司，表情比平时更加阴沉，因为我们看见他把头都伸进壁橱里，他不仅是洗了手，还洗了脸，漱了口。在他洗完脸之后，他甚至抽出了整条毛巾来擦干，他拿出了小刀，将指甲里的因为案子而粘上的污垢全部刮掉，然后穿上了他的大衣。","It fell out as Wemmick had told me it would, that I had an early opportunity of comparing my guardian’s establishment with that of his cashier and clerk.My guardian was in his room, washing his hands with his scented soap, when I went into the office from Walworth; and he called me to him, and gave me the invitation for myself and friends which Wemmick had prepared me to receive.“No ceremony,” he stipulated, “and no dinner dress, and say tomorrow.”I asked him where we should come to (for I had no idea where he lived), and I believe it was in his general objection to make anything like an admission, that he replied, “Come here, and I’ll take you home with me.”I embrace this opportunity of remarking that he washed his clients off, as if he were a surgeon or a dentist.He had a closet in his room, fitted up for the purpose, which smelt of the scented soap like a perfumer’s shop.It had an unusually large jack-towel on a roller inside the door, and he would wash his hands, and wipe them and dry them all over this towel, whenever he came in from a police-court or dismissed a client from his room.When I and my friends repaired to him at six o’clock next day, he seemed to have been engaged on a case of a darker complexion than usual, for, we found him with his head butted into this closet, not only washing his hands, but laving his face and gargling his throat.And even when he had done all that, and had gone all round the jack-towel, he took out his penknife and scraped the case out of his nails before he put his coat on."
"在我们走上大街的时候，照样还是有人偷偷摸摸地游荡在附近，明显是希望要和他说话。但是他香皂所形成的香气形成了如此有决定性作用的光圈，围绕在他周围，使得那些人放弃了一天的希望。在我们一直向西行的时候，他又一次被街头人群中的人们认出来了，不管事情怎样，他都高声跟我说话。而相反，他从未认出任何人，也没有注意那些认出他的人。","There were some people slinking about as usual when we passed out into the street, who were evidently anxious to speak with him; but there was something so conclusive in the halo of scented soap which encircled his presence, that they gave it up for that day.As we walked along westward, he was recognized ever and again by some face in the crowd of the streets, and whenever that happened he talked louder to me; but he never otherwise recognized anybody, or took notice that anybody recognized him."
"他带着我们来到苏豪区杰勒德街，来到了街南头的一座房子。那幢房子看起来相当庄严，但急需重新刷一遍墙，而且窗子也很脏。他拿出钥匙，开了房门，我们进入了一间石制的大厅，里面空荡荡，又阴气沉沉，看来很少使用。因而，沿着深棕色的楼梯上去，在二楼有一排深棕色的房间。四周的墙裙上雕刻着花环，他就站在中间，向我们表示欢迎，我知道这些花环形成的圈圈看起来像什么。","He conducted us to Gerrard-street, Soho, to a house on the south side of that street.Rather a stately house of its kind, but dolefully in want of painting, and with dirty windows.He took out his key and opened the door, and we all went into a stone hall, bare, gloomy, and little used.So, up a dark brown staircase into a series of three dark brown rooms on the first floor.There were carved garlands on the paneled walls, and as he stood among them giving us welcome, I know what kind of loops I thought they looked like."
"晚饭设在最好的一间房内；第二好的房间是他的更衣室；接下来就是他的卧室了。他告诉我们他拥有整座房产，但是除了我们见到的这几间，其他的房间几乎不怎么使用。饭桌摆设得很得体——当然餐具都不是银的——在他座位的一边有一个巨大的旋转餐台，上面放着各式各样的杯子和玻璃瓶，还有四盘用来当甜点的水果。在整个过程当中，我发现他将每一件东西都掌握在他自己的手中，而且亲自分配食物。","Dinner was laid in the best of these rooms; the second was his dressing-room; the third, his bedroom.He told us that he held the whole house, but rarely used more of it than we saw.The table was comfortably laid—no silver in the service, of course—and at the side of his chair was a capacious dumb-waiter, with a variety of bottles and decanters on it, and four dishes of fruit for dessert.I noticed throughout, that he kept everything under his own hand, and distributed everything himself."
"房间里有一个书架。从书脊上，我发现那些全都是有关案件证据的，都是犯罪法、罪犯传记、庭审、国会法案之类的东西。那些家具都非常坚固、质量上乘，就像他的表链一样。然而，这个房间看起来就像个办公室，没有看见一件装饰用的东西。在角落里，有一张堆满了纸的桌子，灯光昏黄：所以从这一点来看，他也是将办公室搬回家了，以便在晚上把桌子推出来，继续办公。","There was a bookcase in the room; I saw, from the backs of the books, that they were about evidence, criminal law, criminal biography, trials, acts of parliament, and such things.The furniture was all very solid and good, like his watch-chain.It had an official look, however, and there was nothing merely ornamental to be seen.In a corner, was a little table of papers with a shaded lamp: so that he seemed to bring the office home with him in that respect too, and to wheel it out of an evening and fall to work."
"直到现在，他还没怎么见过我的三个伙伴——因为他是和我走在一起的——现在他按过铃之后，站在壁炉前的地毯上，仔细地审视着他们。让我吃惊的是，他似乎马上就对德鲁莫尔产生了兴趣，就算不是只对他的话，也是主要对他有了兴趣。","As he had scarcely seen my three companions until now—for, he and I had walked together—he stood on the hearth-rug, after ringing the bell, and took a searching look at them.To my surprise, he seemed at once to be principally if not solely interested in Drummle."
"“皮普，”他将他的大手搭在我的肩膀上，把我带向窗户那边，说，“他们三个我一个都不认识。哪一个是蜘蛛？”","“Pip,” said he, putting his large hand on my shoulder and moving me to the window, “I don’t know one from the other.Who’s the Spider?”"
"“蜘蛛？”我说。","“The spider?” said I. "
"“就是那个身上脏兮兮、四仰八叉、死气沉沉的家伙。”","“The blotchy, sprawly, sulky fellow.”"
"“那个是本特利·德鲁莫尔。”我回答说，“长着精致面孔的是斯塔特普。”","“That’s Bentley Drummle,” I replied; “the one with the delicate face is Startop.”"
"他一点都没在意那个“长着精致面孔的人”，又说道：“本特利·德鲁莫尔是他的名字，是不是？我喜欢这个家伙的长相。”","Not making the least account of “the one with the delicate face,” he returned, “Bentley Drummle is his name, is it?I like the look of that fellow.”"
"他立马就跟德鲁莫尔攀谈起来：他的兴致并没有因为他又慢又迟钝的答话而减弱，相反，他就像拧螺丝一样把他的话挤出来。正当我看着他们俩的时候，女管家出现在我和他们之间，摆上第一道菜。","He immediately began to talk to Drummle: not at all deterred by his replying in his heavy reticent way, but apparently led on by it to screw discourse out of him.I was looking at the two, when there came between me and them, the housekeeper, with the first dish for the table."
"我想她是一个大约四十岁的妇女——但是我觉得，她生得更年轻一些。她的身材相当高挑，而且身体柔软敏捷，脸色非常苍白，眼睛大却暗淡无光，头发是披下来的。我不知道是不是什么心脏疾病使得她双唇微张，好像在喘气，而且她的脸上也显出突兀且烦躁的奇特表情。不过我一两天前晚上去剧院看过《麦克白》，她的这张脸看上去像是被炽热的空气所扰，就像从女巫的汽锅中升起的那张脸一样。","She was a woman of about forty, I supposed—but I may have thought her younger than she was.Rather tall, of a lithe nimble figure, extremely pale, with large faded eyes, and a quantity of streaming hair.I cannot say whether any diseased affection of the heart caused her lips to be parted as if she were panting, and her face to bear a curious expression of suddenness and flutter; but I know that I had been to see Macbeth at the theatre, a night or two before, and that her face looked to me as if it were all disturbed by fiery air, like the faces I had seen rise out of the Witches’ caldron."
"她把菜放好，轻轻用手指碰了一下我的监护人的胳膊，示意他晚饭已准备好了，之后就不见了。我们围着圆桌做好，我的监护人将德鲁莫尔安排在他的旁边，斯塔特普则坐在另一边。女管家放在桌子上这道菜是味道鲜美的鱼，之后我们吃了同样好吃的羊肉，然后是毫不逊色的野禽。酱油、酒和我们需要的所有调味料全是上乘东西，都在主人的旋转餐台上，并由他分发。在我们将这些东西绕着桌子传过一圈之后，他就把它们放回原处。同样地，每上一道菜，他都要给我们分发干净的盘子和刀叉，在用完之后将它们都放在他座位旁边地上的篮子里。除了这位女管家，也没有其他佣人出现过。每一道菜都是她上的，而且我总是看到她那张汽锅里升起的脸。多年之后，在一间黑暗的房间里，我让一位面相和她一点都不像，只是也长着长发的女人隔着一碗燃烧的烈酒走过，就看到了这个女人同样可怕的面孔。","She set the dish on, touched my guardian quietly on the arm with a finger to notify that dinner was ready, and vanished.We took our seats at the round table, and my guardian kept Drummle on one side of him, while Startop sat on the other.It was a noble dish of fish that the housekeeper had put on table, and we had a joint of equally choice mutton afterwards, and then an equally choice bird.Sauces, wines, all the accessories we wanted, and all of the best, were given out by our host from his dumb-waiter; and when they had made the circuit of the table, he always put them back again.Similarly, he dealt us clean plates and knives and forks, for each course, and dropped those just disused into two baskets on the ground by his chair.No other attendant than the housekeeper appeared.She set on every dish; and I always saw in her face, a face rising out of the caldron.Years afterwards, I made a dreadful likeness of that woman, by causing a face that had no other natural resemblance to it than it derived from flowing hair, to pass behind a bowl of flaming spirits in a dark room."
"这个女管家尤其吸引我的注意力，一是因为她吓人的样子，二是因为温米克之前的话。我发现无论什么时候，她都全神贯注地注视着我的监护人，而且在她把菜放在他面前之后，她会犹豫地缩回手，唯恐他再把她叫回来似的，而且如果他有话要说，就希望他趁她在的时候快说。我想象着我能从他的行为中察觉到，他知道这种情况，但却想让她一直心神不宁。","Induced to take particular notice of the housekeeper, both by her own striking appearance and by Wemmick’s preparation, I observed that whenever she was in the room, she kept her eyes attentively on my guardian, and that she would remove her hands from any dish she put before him, hesitatingly, as if she dreaded his calling her back, and wanted him to speak when she was nigh, if he had anything to say.I fancied that I could detect in his manner a consciousness of this, and a purpose of always holding her in suspense."
"整个晚餐进行得非常愉快，尽管我的监护人从不提起新的话题，但是我知道他已经攥住了我们每一个人性格中最弱的地方。对于我来说，我发现在我还没张开嘴说话之前，就表现出我奢靡的消费倾向，既要资助赫伯特，又要吹嘘自己的远大前程。我们全部人都是这样，但都比不上德鲁莫尔：在鱼还没有端走的时候，他对其他人的吝啬及疑心就被看出来了。","Dinner went off gaily, and, although my guardian seemed to follow rather than originate subjects, I knew that he wrenched the weakest part of our dispositions out of us.For myself, I found that I was expressing my tendency to lavish expenditure, and to patronize Herbert, and to boast of my great prospects, before I quite knew that I had opened my lips.It was so with all of us, but with no one more than Drummle: the development of whose inclination to gird in a grudging and suspicious way at the rest, was screwed out of him before the fish was taken off."
"之后不久，在我们开始吃奶酪的时候，我们的谈话就提及了我们的划船技艺，德鲁莫尔便被我们攻击，说他有一晚以他那种两栖动物的方式跟在我们后面。德鲁莫尔听到这些，则对我们的主人说，他很喜欢和我们保持一段距离，在技巧方面他甚至强于我们的师傅，在力量方面他可以把我们像谷糠一样驱散开来。我的监护人用一种无形的力量伤害了他，以至于他几乎要因为这点小事露出他凶残的面目了。他甚至将他的手臂亮出来，向我们展示他的肌肉，而我们也可笑地露出手臂。","It was not then, but when we had got to the cheese, that our conversation turned upon our rowing feats, and that Drummle was rallied for coming up behind of a night in that slow amphibious way of his.Drummle upon this, informed our host that he much preferred our room to our company, and that as to skill he was more than our master, and that as to strength he could scatter us like chaff.By some invisible agency, my guardian wound him up to a pitch little short of ferocity about this trifle; and he fell to baring and spanning his arm to show how muscular it was, and we all fell to baring and spanning our arms in a ridiculous manner."
"现在，管家就在这时来清理桌面了。我的监护人并没有留意她，而是把脸从她那边转过来，靠着椅背，咬着他的食指，流露出对德鲁莫尔的兴趣。对我来说，这一切非常难以理解。突然，就在管家将手伸向桌子另一头的时候，他用他的大手拍了拍管家的手，就像设下的一个陷阱似的。他的动作突然而潇洒，我们全部都停止了愚蠢的争论。","Now, the housekeeper was at that time clearing the table; my guardian, taking no heed of her, but with the side of his face turned from her, was leaning back in his chair biting the side of his forefinger and showing an interest in Drummle, that, to me, was quite inexplicable.Suddenly, he clapped his large hand on the housekeeper’s, like a trap, as she stretched it across the table.So suddenly and smartly did he do this, that we all stopped in our foolish contention."
"“要是说到力量，”贾格尔斯先生说，“我给你看看这个手腕。莫利，让他们看看你的手腕。”","“If you talk of strength,” said Mr. Jaggers, “I’ll show you a wrist.Molly, let them see your wrist.”"
"她落入陷阱的手就在桌子上，但是她已经将另一只手背到腰后去了。“主人，”她用低沉的声音说道，同时用乞求的目光死死地盯着他，“不要。”","Her entrapped hand was on the table, but she had already put her other hand behind her waist.“Master,” she said, in a low voice, with her eyes attentively and entreatingly fixed upon him.“Don’t.”"
"“我给你们看这个手腕。”贾格尔斯先生重复道，他并没有动摇这决心，“莫利，让他们看看你的手腕。”","“I’ll show you a wrist,” repeated Mr. Jaggers, with an immovable determination to show it.“Molly, let them see your wrist.”"
"“主人。”她又嘟哝着说，“不要！”","“Master,” she again murmured.“Please!”"
"“莫利，”贾格尔斯先生并没有看她，而是倔强地看着房间的另一面，说，“让他们看看你的两个手腕。给他们看。快！”","“Molly,” said Mr. Jaggers, not looking at her, but obstinately looking at the opposite side of the room, “let them see both your wrists.Show them.Come!”"
"他把手从她手上拿开，将她的手腕翻转过来，放在桌面上。她从身后伸出另一只手，将两只手并排放着。第二只手腕非常丑陋——上面有很深的伤疤，而且一道道都重叠在一起。当她伸出手时，她将目光从贾格尔斯先生身上转移开，进而警惕地挨个看着我们其他人。","He took his hand from hers, and turned that wrist up on the table.She brought her other hand from behind her, and held the two out side by side.The last wrist was much disfigured—deeply scarred and scarred across and across.When she held her hands out, she took her eyes from Mr. Jaggers, and turned them watchfully on every one of the rest of us in succession."
"“这里都是力量。”贾格尔斯先生说，他沉着地用食指指出了那些肌肉，“很少有男人的手腕像这个女人的那样有力。仅仅是这双手的握力就非常惊人。我有机会见到很多双手，但是在这方面还从未见过比这个更强有力的手了，不管是男人的手还是女人的手。”","“There’s power here,” said Mr. Jaggers, coolly tracing out the sinews with his forefinger.“Very few men have the power of wrist that this woman has.It’s remarkable what mere force of grip there is in these hands.I have had occasion to notice many hands; but I never saw stronger in that respect, man’s or woman’s, than these.”"
"他以从容不迫的评论风格说出了这番话，同时她依旧按我们座位的顺序挨个看着我们。当他停下的那一刻，她又看着他。“行了，莫利。”贾格尔斯先生说着，向她微微点头，“大家都很钦佩你的手，你可以走了。”她把手缩回去，走出房间，贾格尔斯先生从他的旋转餐台上拿来玻璃瓶，斟满他的酒杯，再将酒传了一圈。","While he said these words in a leisurely critical style, she continued to look at every one of us in regular succession as we sat.The moment he ceased, she looked at him again.“That’ll do, Molly,” said Mr. Jaggers, giving her a slight nod; “you have been admired, and can go.”She withdrew her hands and went out of the room, and Mr. Jaggers, putting the decanters on from his dumb-waiter, filled his glass and passed round the wine."
"“在九点半的时候，先生们，”他说，“我们必须结束。请大家一定珍惜你们的时间。我很高兴见到你们。德鲁莫尔先生，我敬你一杯。”","“At half-past nine, gentlemen,” said he, “we must break up.Pray make the best use of your time.I am glad to see you all.Mr. Drummle, I drink to you.”"
"如果他特别选出德鲁莫尔是为了让他暴露出更多的性格弱点，那么他完全成功了。带着阴沉的胜利感，德鲁莫尔闷闷不乐地对我们其他人表现出蔑视的神情，而且变得越来越无理，直到他的行为已完全让人不可忍受。在这个过程中的每一阶段，贾格尔斯先生都以奇怪的兴趣密切地注视着他。实际上，他似乎成了贾格尔斯先生的佐酒料。","If his object in singling out Drummle were to bring him out still more, it perfectly succeeded.In a sulky triumph, Drummle showed his morose depreciation of the rest of us, in a more and more offensive degree until he became downright intolerable.Through all his stages, Mr. Jaggers followed him with the same strange interest.He actually seemed to serve as a zest to Mr. Jaggers’ wine."
"由于我们尚未成熟，缺乏判断力，我敢说我们都喝多了，而且我知道我们说得也太多了。对于德鲁莫尔的一些粗鄙的讥笑，我们变得非常激动，因为他说我们花钱太大手大脚。这一点让我失去了判断力，因而满腔怒火地说，他这样说非常无理，并且大约一个星期之前，他还在当着我的面向斯塔特普借钱了呢。","In our boyish want of discretion I dare say we took too much to drink, and I know we talked too much.We became particularly hot upon some boorish sneer of Drummle’s, to the effect that we were too free with our money.It led to my remarking, with more zeal than discretion, that it came with a bad grace from him, to whom Startop had lent money in my presence but a week or so before."
"“很好，”德鲁莫尔反驳道，“我会还给他的。”","“Well,” retorted Drummle; “he’ll be paid.”"
"“我不是想说你不会还钱，”我说，“我是希望，你在我们和我们的钱这方面保持沉默。”","“I don’t mean to imply that he won’t,” said I, “but it might make you hold your tongue about us and our money, I should think.”"
"“你倒想！”德鲁莫尔反驳道，“哦，我的天啊！”","“You should think!” retorted Drummle. “Oh Lord!”"
"“我敢说，”我语气十分严肃地说道，“要是我们有需要的话，你不会借钱给我们任何一个人。”","“I dare say,” I went on, meaning to be very severe, “that you wouldn’t lend money to any of us, if we wanted it.”"
"“你说对了。”德鲁莫尔说，“我一分钱都不会借给你们的。我一分钱都不会借给任何人。”","“You are right,” said Drummle.“I wouldn’t lend one of you a sixpence.I wouldn’t lend anybody a sixpence.”"
"“我想，在这样的环境下借钱可是相当低劣的行径。”","“Rather mean to borrow under those circumstances, I should say.”"
"“你想。”德鲁莫尔重复道，“哦，我的天啊！”","“You should say,” repeated Drummle.“Oh Lord!”"
"这种情况非常恼人——尤其是我发觉我根本无法阻止他又粗暴又愚蠢的行为——我没有理会赫伯特的制止，说道：","This was so very aggravating—the more especially as I found myself making no way against his surly obtuseness—that I said, disregarding Herbert’s efforts to check me:"
"“少来了，德鲁莫尔先生，既然我们说到这个话题了，我就要跟你说说你借钱的时候我和赫伯特都说了些什么。”","“Come, Mr. Drummle, since we are on the subject, I’ll tell you what passed between Herbert here and me, when you borrowed that money.”"
"“我可不想知道你和赫伯特都说了些什么。”德鲁莫尔咆哮道。而且我觉得他压低声音还说了什么，也许是我们俩都应该下地狱、去我们的之类的话。","“I don’t want to know what passed between Herbert there and you,” growled Drummle.And I think he added in a lower growl, that we might both go to the devil and shake ourselves."
"“但是，我要告诉你，”我说，“不管你想不想知道。在你得意地把钱装进口袋的时候，我们说看到他如此软弱地就把钱借给你，你似乎感到非常好笑。”","“I’ll tell you, however,” said I, “whether you want to know or not.We said that as you put it in your pocket very glad to get it, you seemed to be immensely amused at his being so weak as to lend it.”"
"德鲁莫尔立马笑了出来，而且坐在那里对着我们大笑，两手插在口袋里，耸着圆滚滚的肩膀：这样分明意味着我们说的都是真的，他把我们都当成了笨驴。","Drummle laughed outright, and sat laughing in our faces, with his hands in his pockets and his round shoulders raised: plainly signifying that it was quite true, and that he despised us, as asses all."
"这时斯塔特普将他抓了起来，即便他比我表现得优雅很多，他也劝告他要客气一点。斯塔特普是一位活泼愉快的年轻人，而德鲁莫尔正好相反，后者总是倾向于将他当做一个最直接的死对头。他用粗鄙而迟钝的语言进行反击，而斯塔特普却试图将话题岔开，他讲了一小段笑话，我们全部人都笑了起来。德鲁莫尔对这一小小的胜利产生了深深的怨恨，在没有发出任何威胁或警告的情况下，他将手从口袋里伸出来，放下他肥滚滚的肩膀，大声咒骂着拿起一个玻璃杯，想向他的对手的头部砸去，但是就在他做出这一动作之时，我们的主人立即灵活地抓住了杯子。","Hereupon Startop took him in hand, though with a much better grace than I had shown, and exhorted him to be a little more agreeable.Startop, being a lively bright young fellow, and Drummle being the exact opposite, the latter was always disposed to resent him as a direct personal affront.He now retorted in a coarse lumpish way, and Startop tried to turn the discussion aside with some small pleasantry that made us all laugh.Resenting this little success more than anything, Drummle, without any threat or warning, pulled his hands out of his pockets, dropped his round shoulders, swore, took up a large glass, and would have flung it at his adversary’s head, but for our entertainer’s dexterously seizing it at the instant when it was raised for that purpose."
"“先生，”贾格尔斯先生慢慢地放下杯子，然后拿出那块挂着一根粗链子的金怀表，说道，“我非常抱歉地告诉大家，现在已经是九点半了。”","“Gentlemen,” said Mr. Jaggers, deliberately putting down the glass, and hauling out his gold repeater by its massive chain, “I am exceedingly sorry to announce that it’s half-past nine.”"
"听到这条暗示，我们都起身准备离开。在我们走到通向街道的大门之前，斯塔特普已经高兴地称呼德鲁莫尔为“兄弟”了，好像什么事都没有发生似的。但是这位兄弟非但没有回应，甚至在回哈默史密斯的时候都不愿和他同路。所以，留在城里的我和赫伯特就看到他们两人走在路的两边，斯塔特普走在前面，德鲁莫尔则跟在后面，走在房屋的影子里，和他习惯于跟在他船后面的情形非常相像。","On this hint we all rose to depart.Before we got to the street door, Startop was cheerily calling Drummle “old boy,” as if nothing had happened.But the old boy was so far from responding, that he would not even walk to Hammersmith on the same side of the way; so, Herbert and I, who remained in town, saw them going down the street on opposite sides; Startop leading, and Drummle lagging behind in the shadow of the houses, much as he was wont to follow in his boat."
"由于大门还没有关，我想我应该让赫伯特先等一会儿，让我再上楼去和我的监护人说两句话。我看到他在更衣室，四周都是他库存的靴子，他已经在用力地洗手了，想洗净我们留下的气味。","As the door was not yet shut, I thought I would leave Herbert there for a moment, and run up-stairs again to say a word to my guardian.I found him in his dressing-room surrounded by his stock of boots, already hard at it, washing his hands of us."
"我告诉他，对于刚才发生的不愉快的事我感到非常抱歉，我希望他不要过多地指责我。","I told him I had come up again to say how sorry I was that anything disagreeable should have occurred, and that I hoped he would not blame me much."
"“扑！”他正在冲脸，在水流中说道，“没关系，皮普。但是我喜欢那个蜘蛛。”","“Pooh!” said he, sluicing his face, and speaking through the water-drops; “it’s nothing, Pip.I like that Spider though.”"
"现在他转向了我，他摇着头、喘着气，还用毛巾擦着脸。","He had turned towards me now, and was shaking his head, and blowing, and toweling himself."
"“你喜欢他，我感到很高兴，”我说：“但是，我不喜欢他。”","“I am glad you like him, sir,” said I—“but I don’t.”"
"“没错，没错，”我的监护人同意我的观点，“别跟他走得太近。尽你所能离他远点。但是我喜欢那个家伙，皮普，他是那种真性情的人。唉，要是我是个算命的——”","“No, no,” my guardian assented; “don’t have too much to do with him.Keep as clear of him as you can.But I like the fellow, Pip; he is one of the true sort.Why, if I was a fortune-teller—”"
"他的眼睛从毛巾里露出来，正好和我的目光相遇。","Looking out of the towel, he caught my eye."
"“但是我不是个算命的，”他说着，又将头埋在了他的大花彩毛巾里，擦着他的耳朵，“你知道我是干什么的，不是吗？晚安，皮普。”","“But I am not a fortune-teller,” he said, letting his head drop into a festoon of towel, and toweling away at his two ears.“You know what I am, don’t you?Good-night, Pip.”"
"“晚安，先生。”","“Good-night, sir.”"
"大概在一个月之后，这位蜘蛛和鄱凯特先生的租约就到期了。他回他家的蜘蛛洞去了，而除了鄱凯特夫人，我们大家都觉得如释重负。","In about a month after that, the Spider’s time with Mr. Pocket was up for good, and, to the great relief of all the house but Mrs. Pocket, he went home to the family hole."
"第二十七章","Chapter 27"
"“我亲爱的皮普先生,","“MY DEAR MR PIP,"
"应格雷戈里先生的要求，我写这封信给你，通知你他即将在沃甫赛先生的陪同下前往伦敦，要是你愿意见他，他会非常高兴的。在星期二早上九点，他会到巴纳德旅馆，要是这个时间不合适的话，请留一张字条。你可怜的姐姐基本上和你离开时所见到的一样，没有什么起色。我们每天晚上都会在厨房里谈起你，想着你在说些什么，做些什么。若是你认为这样做有些过分的话，念在我们旧时的情谊，你就原谅我们吧。不多说了，亲爱的皮普先生，写自你永远忠诚且挚爱的仆人，比迪。”“附注：他希望我特别写上‘多么开心啊’。他说你会明白其中的意思的。我希望并且毫不怀疑，即便你是一个绅士，你也会同意见他的，因为你有一颗如此善良的心，而他也是一位非常非常值得尊敬的人。我已经给他读了所有的话，除了最后这个短句子，他希望我再次特别写上‘多么开心啊’。”","“I write this by request of Mr. Gargery, for to let you know that he is going to London in company with Mr. Wopsle and would be glad if agreeable to be allowed to see you.He would call at Barnard’s Hotel Tuesday morning 9 o’clock, when if not agreeable please leave word.Your poor sister is much the same as when you left.We talk of you in the kitchen every night, and wonder what you are saying and doing.If now considered in the light of a liberty, excuse it for the love of poor old days.No more, dear Mr. Pip, from your ever obliged, and affectionate servant,“BIDDY.”“P.S. He wishes me most particular to write what larks.He says you will understand.I hope and do not doubt it will be agreeable to see him even though a gentleman, for you had ever a good heart, and he is a worthy worthy man.I have read him all excepting only the last little sentence, and he wishes me most particular to write again what larks.”"
"星期一早上我收到了这封寄来的信，因此这个约会也就是在第二天了。让我坦白说出我是以什么样的心情来迎接乔的到来的吧。","I received this letter by the post on Monday morning, and therefore its appointment was for next day.Let me confess exactly, with what feelings I looked forward to Joe’s coming."
"这种心情并不是喜悦，即便我和他有着千丝万缕的联系，不，我觉得这是相当大的困扰，夹杂着某种羞辱感，而且感到非常不合时宜。要是我能用钱将他据之于千里之外的话，我肯定会这样做了。而让我觉得放心的是他要来巴纳德旅馆，而不是哈默史密斯，因此就不会撞见本特利·德鲁莫尔了。我绝不会反对他见赫伯特或者是他的父亲，因为我对他们两个都很尊重。但是要是他见到德鲁莫尔的话，我就会有强烈的神经过敏，因为我轻视德鲁莫尔。所以在人的一生当中，我们往往为了自己最鄙视的人而犯下最糟糕、最卑鄙的罪行。","Not with pleasure, though I was bound to him by so many ties; no; with considerable disturbance, some mortification, and a keen sense of incongruity.If I could have kept him away by paying money, I certainly would have paid money.My greatest reassurance was, that he was coming to Barnard’s Inn, not to Hammersmith, and consequently would not fall in Bentley Drummle’s way.I had little objection to his being seen by Herbert or his father, for both of whom I had a respect; but I had the sharpest sensitiveness as to his being seen by Drummle, whom I held in contempt.So, throughout life, our worst weaknesses and meannesses are usually committed for the sake of the people whom we most despise."
"我一直在着手装饰我的房间，而且是以不必要且不恰当的方式，并且花销非常昂贵，目的就是想改变巴纳德旅馆的那种风格。到了现在，这套房间已经和我最初看见的大不相同了，而且我还享受到一种荣誉，就是在附近一位家具商的账本上拥有几页可观的赊账记录。最近的进展速度非常快，我甚至雇了一个穿靴子——长筒靴——的男仆，我也许应该说，在雇佣他的那些日子里，其实是我受了他的束缚和奴役。因为，在我雇佣了这个小怪物之后（他只是我的洗衣妇家里的废物），我给他穿上蓝色的大衣，淡黄色的马甲，白色领结和乳白色的马裤，靴子我已经提到了，但是我没什么事要他做，而他却吃得很多，光凭吃穿这两样就足够折磨我的生活了。","I had begun to be always decorating the chambers in some quite unnecessary and inappropriate way or other, and very expensive those wrestles with Barnard proved to be.By this time, the rooms were vastly different from what I had found them, and I enjoyed the honor of occupying a few prominent pages in the books of a neighboring upholsterer.I had got on so fast of late, that I had even started a boy in boots—top boots—in bondage and slavery to whom I might have been said to pass my days.For, after I had made the monster (out of the refuse of my washerwoman’s family) and had clothed him with a blue coat, canary waistcoat, white cravat, creamy breeches, and the boots already mentioned, I had to find him a little to do and a great deal to eat; and with both of those horrible requirements he haunted my existence."
"我命令这个来复仇的幽灵在星期二的早晨去大厅里值班（这是一个两英尺的方形大厅，那块铺地板的布也是赊来的），赫伯特提议早餐吃哪几样食物，因为他觉得乔会喜欢那些食物的。对于他的兴趣和体贴，我感到由衷的感谢。但我自己却有一种奇怪的、半愤怒的猜疑，想着如果乔是来看望他的话，他就不会为此忙前忙后了。","This avenging phantom was ordered to be on duty at eight on Tuesday morning in the hall (it was two feet square, as charged for floor-cloth), and Herbert suggested certain things for breakfast that he thought Joe would like.While I felt sincerely obliged to him for being so interested and considerate, I had an odd half-provoked sense of suspicion upon me, that if Joe had been coming to see him, he wouldn’t have been quite so brisk about it."
"然而，我在星期一晚上来到市区，准备好见乔了。早上我起得很早，将起居室和餐桌布置得极为富丽堂皇。不幸的是，早上下起了毛毛雨，就算天使也掩盖不了巴纳德旅馆窗外流下的灰黑的眼泪，泪水就像是一个软弱的、扫烟囱的巨人流下的。","However, I came into town on the Monday night to be ready for Joe, and I got up early in the morning, and caused the sitting-room and breakfast-table to assume their most splendid appearance.Unfortunately the morning was drizzly, and an angel could not have concealed the fact that Barnard was shedding sooty tears outside the window, like some weak giant of a Sweep."
"随着时间慢慢地逼近，我很想逃走，但是那个复仇鬼就依照命令站在大厅里，不久我就听见乔上楼梯的声音了。从他笨拙的上楼声判断，我知道那是乔——他那双正式场合穿的靴子对他来说总是太大——上楼的时候，他每到一层都要读门牌上的名字。最终他在我们的门外停下了，我能听见他的手指在摸着我的名字，之后我清楚地听到他从钥匙孔呼气的声音。最后他轻轻地敲了一下门，之后佩珀——那个复仇鬼男仆暂时的名字——通报道：“格雷戈里先生到！”我想他永远都蹭不完他的鞋了，我必须得出去把他从垫子上提起来，但是他最终还是进来了。","As the time approached I should have liked to run away, but the Avenger pursuant to orders was in the hall, and presently I heard Joe on the staircase.I knew it was Joe, by his clumsy manner of coming up-stairs—his state boots being always too big for him—and by the time it took him to read the names on the other floors in the course of his ascent.When at last he stopped outside our door, I could hear his finger tracing over the painted letters of my name, and I afterwards distinctly heard him breathing in at the keyhole.Finally he gave a faint single rap, and Pepper—such was the compromising name of the avenging boy—announced “Mr. Gargery!”I thought he never would have done wiping his feet, and that I must have gone out to lift him off the mat, but at last he came in."
"“乔，你好吗，乔？”","“Joe, how are you, Joe?”"
"“皮普，里好吗，皮普？”","“Pip, how AIR you, Pip?”"
"他善良而诚实的脸上放着光芒，他摘下帽子，放在了我们中间，抓住我两只手上下摇着，就好像我是最新获得专利的抽水机一样。","With his good honest face all glowing and shining, and his hat put down on the floor between us, he caught both my hands and worked them straight up and down, as if I had been the last-patented Pump."
"“我很高兴见到你，乔。把你的帽子给我吧。”","“I am glad to see you, Joe.Give me your hat.”"
"但是乔却双手小心翼翼地握着帽子，就像它是个装着鸟蛋的鸟巢一样。他不会和他任何一件财产分离，坚持要站着，捧着帽子，以最不舒服的方式进行我们的谈话。","But Joe, taking it up carefully with both hands, like a bird’s-nest with eggs in it, wouldn’t hear of parting with that piece of property, and persisted in standing talking over it in a most uncomfortable way."
"“你长大了，”乔说，“也胖了，变得有绅士风度了。”乔想了一会儿之后说道，“我敢说你一定是国王和国家的荣耀。”","“Which you have that growed,” said Joe, “and that swelled, and that gentle-folked;” Joe considered a little before he discovered this word; “as to be sure you are a honor to your king and country.”"
"“乔，你看上去也很不错。”","“And you, Joe, look wonderfully well.”"
"“谢谢上帝，”乔说，“我还不错。还有你的姐姐，她也还是老样子。还有比迪，她总是那么健康，做事风风火火。所有的朋友们即便没有进步，但是也没有退步。除了沃甫赛，他的生活有所下降。”","“Thank God,” said Joe, “I’m ekerval to most.And your sister, she’s no worse than she were.And Biddy, she’s ever right and ready.And all friends is no backerder, if not no forarder.’Ceptin Wopsle; he’s had a drop.”"
"自始至终（他还是双手小心地捧着那个鸟巢），乔的眼睛都在房间里转来转去，还上下打量着我的绣花睡袍。","All this time (still with both hands taking great care of the bird’s-nest), Joe was rolling his eyes round and round the room, and round and round the flowered pattern of my dressing-gown."
"“有所下降，乔？”","“Had a drop, Joe?”"
"“啊，是的。”乔压低了声音说道，“他离开了教堂，成为了一个演员。而演员这份工作将他带到了伦敦，所以他和我一起来了。他的愿望就是，”这时他将那个鸟巢放在左腋下，用右手在里面摸索着鸟蛋，说道，“我没有任何冒犯之意，但是我想给你看一下这个。”","“Why yes,” said Joe, lowering his voice, “he’s left the Church, and went into the playacting.Which the playacting have likeways brought him to London along with me.And his wish were,” said Joe, getting the bird’s-nest under his left arm for the moment and groping in it for an egg with his right; “if no offence, as I would ‘and you that.”"
"我接过了乔给我的东西，发现那是一家小型城市剧院的节目单，第一页上就写着，在那个星期，“与罗西乌斯齐名的著名业余演员将登台献艺，其演出的我国国民诗人的伟大悲剧作品曾经在地方戏剧界引起了轰动。”","I took what Joe gave me, and found it to be the crumpled playbill of a small metropolitan theatre, announcing the first appearance, in that very week, of “the celebrated Provincial Amateur of Roscian renown, whose unique performance in the highest tragic walk of our National Bard has lately occasioned so great a sensation in local dramatic circles.”"
"“你看过他的演出吗，乔？”我问道。","“Were you at his performance, Joe?” I inquired. "
"“我看过。”乔一本正经地强调。","“I were,” said Joe, with emphasis and solemnity."
"“它引起巨大轰动了吗？”","“Was there a great sensation?”"
"“唉，”乔说，“是的，那里当然是有很多桔子皮的。特别是他见到鬼的那一场。我想你可以设身处地地想一想，先生，要是有人不停地喊着‘阿门’，打断他和那个鬼魂的谈话，那么他怎能安心做好他的工作呢！一个人可能会因为不幸而去了教堂工作，”乔说着，压低了声音，用争辩且动情的语气说道，“但是在这样的时候你没有理由将他拒之门外。我想说的是，如果连自己父亲的灵魂都不注意，那么还有什么值得注意的呢，先生？还有呢，他的那顶丧帽做得太小了，插上黑羽毛之后帽子就会掉下来，你是无论如何都戴不住的啊。”","“Why,” said Joe, “yes, there certainly were a peck of orange-peel.Partickler, when he see the ghost.Though I put it to yourself, sir, whether it were calc’lated to keep a man up to his work with a good hart, to be continiwally cutting in betwixt him and the Ghost with “Amen!”A man may have had a misfortun’ and been in the Church,” said Joe, lowering his voice to an argumentative and feeling tone, “but that is no reason why you should put him out at such a time.Which I meantersay, if the ghost of a man’s own father cannot be allowed to claim his attention, what can, Sir?Still more, when his mourning ’at is unfortunately made so small as that the weight of the black feathers brings it off, try to keep it on how you may.”"
"乔脸上流露出好像见到了鬼似的神情，我知道是赫伯特进了房间。于是我将乔介绍给了赫伯特，赫伯特伸出了手，但是乔却缩回手去，握住了他的鸟巢。","A ghost-seeing effect in Joe’s own countenance informed me that Herbert had entered the room.So, I presented Joe to Herbert, who held out his hand; but Joe backed from it, and held on by the bird’s-nest."
"“你好，先生，”乔说，“我希望你和皮普”——此时他的目光落在了那个复仇鬼的身上，他正在将烤面包摆在桌子上，乔很自然地把这个年轻人当做家里的一员，我向他皱了皱眉，这点让他更困惑了——“我想说，你们两位先生——我希望你们两位在这狭窄的空间里都身体健康吧？依照伦敦人的观点，现在这个旅馆可能是非常好。”乔推心置腹地说，“而且我相信它的特点是会保留下去的。但是我自己就不会在这里养猪——要是我希望猪能养得又肥又健康，吃起来味道又好的话。”","“Your servant, Sir,” said Joe, “which I hope as you and Pip”—here his eye fell on the Avenger, who was putting some toast on table, and so plainly denoted an intention to make that young gentleman one of the family, that I frowned it down and confused him more—“I meantersay, you two gentlemen—which I hope as you get your elths in this close spot?For the present may be a werry good inn, according to London opinions,” said Joe, confidentially, “and I believe its character do stand i; but I wouldn’t keep a pig in it myself—not in the case that I wished him to fatten wholesome and to eat with a meller flavor on him.”"
"乔说了他对我们这个居所的溢美之词，而且附带着显出他对我的尊称——“先生”。然后我们就请他入座，他环顾整个房间，像是要找一个合适的地方来放置他的帽子——就好像它是什么非常稀罕的东西，不能在这里找到落脚的地方一样——最终，他将帽子放在壁炉架的尖角上，而之后它就一直不时地掉下来。","Having borne this flattering testimony to the merits of our dwelling-place, and having incidentally shown this tendency to call me “sir,” Joe, being invited to sit down to table, looked all round the room for a suitable spot on which to deposit his hat—as if it were only on some very few rare substances in nature that it could find a resting place—and ultimately stood it on an extreme corner of the chimney-piece, from which it ever afterwards fell off at intervals."
"“你要喝茶还是喝咖啡，格雷戈里先生？”赫伯特问道，他总是在早上主管这些事物。","“Do you take tea, or coffee, Mr. Gargery?” asked Herbert, who always presided of a morning. "
"“谢谢了，先生。”乔说道，他从头到脚都是僵硬的，“我喝什么都行，只要您方便就好。”","“Thankee, Sir,” said Joe, stiff from head to foot, “I’ll take whichever is most agreeable to yourself.”"
"“咖啡好吗？”","“What do you say to coffee?”"
"“谢谢，先生，”乔回答道，很明显他对这个提议有些沮丧，“既然您选了咖啡，我自然不会提出反对意见。但是您是否觉得那样会有一点热？”","“Thankee, Sir,” returned Joe, evidently dispirited by the proposal, “since you are so kind as make chice of coffee, I will not run contrairy to your own opinions.But don’t you never find it a little ’eating?”"
"“那么就喝茶吧。”赫伯特说着，把咖啡倒掉了。","“Say tea then,” said Herbert, pouring it out."
"这时乔的帽子从壁炉架上掉了下来，他立马从椅子上站起身来，把帽子捡起来，然后又把它放在原来的地方。就好像那里是一个安置他帽子的绝佳地方一样，即使很快它又会掉下来的。","Here Joe’s hat tumbled off the mantel-piece, and he started out of his chair and picked it up, and fitted it to the same exact spot.As if it were an absolute point of good breeding that it should tumble off again soon."
"“你什么时候来到城里的，格雷戈里先生？”","“When did you come to town, Mr. Gargery?”"
"“是昨天下午吗？”乔说着用手遮住嘴咳嗽了几声，就好像自从进城，他已经有足够的时间染上百日咳了一样，“不，不是昨天下午。哦，是的。没错。是昨天下午。”（他表情中夹杂着智慧、放松、还有严格的公平）。","“Were it yesterday afternoon?” said Joe, after coughing behind his hand, as if he had had time to catch the whooping-cough since he came.“No it were not.Yes it were.Yes.It were yesterday afternoon” (with an appearance of mingled wisdom, relief, and strict impartiality)."
"“你游览过伦敦了吗？”","“Have you seen anything of London, yet?”"
"“哦，是的，先生，”乔说，“我和沃甫赛直接去看了鞋油厂。但是我们觉得那里和门上大红的宣传单相比还有些差距。我是想说，”乔解释道，“宣传单上画得真是太壮——观——了。”","“Why, yes, Sir,” said Joe, “me and Wopsle went off straight to look at the Blacking Ware’us.But we didn’t find that it come up to its likeness in the red bills at the shop doors; which I meantersay,” added Joe, in an explanatory manner, “as it is there drawd too architectooralooral.”"
"我真的以为乔会将这个词拖长成为一曲圣曲（而那个词非常具有表现力，使我想起了一些我所知道的建筑），但是幸亏神意降临，他的注意力又被他倾斜的帽子吸引住了。的确，那里需要他一直留意着，还要眼疾手快，要履行类似一个守门员的职责。他表现得很出色，而且这样还展示了他出众的技艺。有时，就在帽子快要掉下来的时候，他就冲过去抓住；有时，就在帽子下落的时候一把抓住，拿起帽子胡闹一气，在房间的各个角落嬉戏，擦到了墙上的壁纸，直到他觉得安全了才停止他的步伐。最后，帽子掉进了污水盆，溅起了水花，这时我才冒昧地拿起了帽子。","I really believe Joe would have prolonged this word (mightily expressive to my mind of some architecture that I know) into a perfect Chorus, but for his attention being providentially attracted by his hat, which was toppling.Indeed, it demanded from him a constant attention, and a quickness of eye and hand, very like that exacted by wicket-keeping.He made extraordinary play with it, and showed the greatest skill; now, rushing at it and catching it neatly as it dropped; now, merely stopping it midway, beating it up, and humoring it in various parts of the room and against a good deal of the pattern of the paper on the wall, before he felt it safe to close with it; finally, splashing it into the slop-basin, where I took the liberty of laying hands upon it.Finally, splashing it into the slop-basin, where I took the liberty of laying hands upon it."
"至于他的衬衣领和大衣领，它们非常令人费解——这两样东西都是不能解决的迷。为什么一个人能觉得自己衣冠整齐，但领口能如此擦来擦去的呢？为什么他会觉得在假日穿上一件如此折磨人的衣服能保持圣洁呢？之后，他陷入了一种无法解释的沉思之中，叉子还在他的嘴和盘子之间架着。他的眼睛被奇怪的方向所吸引着，他也正忍受着剧烈咳嗽的折磨，他坐得离餐桌非常远，掉下去的食物比吃进嘴里的还要多。而当赫伯特离开我们进城的时候，我感到由衷的喜悦。","As to his shirt-collar, and his coat-collar, they were perplexing to reflect upon—insoluble mysteries both.Why should a man scrape himself to that extent, before he could consider himself full dressed?Why should he suppose it necessary to be purified by suffering for his holiday clothes?Then he fell into such unaccountable fits of meditation, with his fork midway between his plate and his mouth; had his eyes attracted in such strange directions; was afflicted with such remarkable coughs; sat so far from the table, and dropped so much more than he ate, and pretended that he hadn’t dropped it; that I was heartily glad when Herbert left us for the city."
"我既判断不出也感觉不到这一切是不是都是我的错，也不知道如果我对他平易一点，他会不会对我也轻松一些。我开始对他不耐烦，还对他发脾气，而在这种情况下他以德报怨却令我感到惭愧。","I had neither the good sense nor the good feeling to know that this was all my fault, and that if I had been easier with Joe, Joe would have been easier with me.I felt impatient of him and out of temper with him; in which condition he heaped coals of fire on my head."
"“我们两个单独在一起了，先生。”——乔开始说道。","“Us two being now alone, Sir,”—began Joe."
"“乔，”我没好气地打断他说，“你怎么能叫我先生呢？”","“Joe,” I interrupted, pettishly, “how can you call me, Sir?”"
"乔立即看了我一眼，眼神里带着些许的责备。尽管他的领结戴得十分荒谬，衣领也很别扭，但是我在他的神情里察觉到了尊严。","Joe looked at me for a single instant with something faintly like reproach.Utterly preposterous as his cravat was, and as his collars were, I was conscious of a sort of dignity in the look."
"“我们俩现在单独在一起了，”乔又继续说道，“我不能再呆很长时间了，现在我必须做一下总结——至少是首先——我要说能来到这里，我感到万分荣幸。要不是，”乔带着他古旧而清晰的语调说道，“我唯一的希望就是我能帮到你，不然我就不应该有此荣幸来到绅士们的住所了。”","“Us two being now alone,” resumed Joe, “and me having the intentions and abilities to stay not many minutes more, I will now conclude—leastways begin—to mention what have led to my having had the present honor.For was it not,” said Joe, with his old air of lucid exposition, “that my only wish were to be useful to you, I should not have had the honor of breaking wittles in the company and abode of gentlemen.”"
"我又一次非常不情愿地看着这样的表情，以至于我对这种语气没有提出任何抗议。","I was so unwilling to see the look again, that I made no remonstrance against this tone."
"“那么，先生，”乔继续说道，“事情是这样的。那天晚上我在‘三个快活船员’酒馆里，皮普。”只要他动了情感，他就会叫我皮普，但什么时候他想到礼数，就会叫我先生，“这时彭波契克驾着他的轻便马车来了。这位先生就是那位，”乔又沿着一个新的思路说道，“有时搞得我摸不着头脑的那位，太可怕了，他来来回回在城里走，就好像他是你儿时的伙伴一样，甚至连你都认为他是你的玩伴似的。”","“Well, Sir,” pursued Joe, “this is how it were.I were at the Bargemen t’other night, Pip;” whenever he subsided into affection, he called me Pip, and whenever he relapsed into politeness he called me Sir; “when there come up in his shay-cart, Pumblechook.Which that same identical,” said Joe, going down a new track, “do comb my ’air the wrong way sometimes, awful, by giving out up and down town as it were him which ever had your infant companionation and were looked upon as a playfellow by yourself.”"
"“真是瞎扯。那样的人就是你啊，乔。”","“Nonsense.It was you, Joe.”"
"“我完全相信，皮普，”他轻轻地摇了一下头，说道，“但是现在也没什么意义了，先生。对了，皮普，还是这个人，他行为嚣张地来到‘三个快活船员’酒馆找我（你知道一斗烟和一品脱啤酒就能让我们这些工人们解解乏，而且也不会过量），他的原话是，‘约瑟夫，郝维仙小姐希望能跟你谈一谈。’”","“Which I fully believed it were, Pip,” said Joe, slightly tossing his head, “though it signify little now, Sir.Well, Pip; this same identical, which his manners is given to blusterous, come to me at the Bargemen (wot a pipe and a pint of beer do give refreshment to the working-man, Sir, and do not over stimilate), and his word were, ‘Joseph, Miss Havisham she wish to speak to you.’”"
"“郝维仙小姐，乔？”","“Miss Havisham, Joe?”"
"“彭波契克的原话是‘她希望跟你谈一谈。’”乔坐下，眼睛望着天花板打转。","“‘She wish,’ were Pumblechook’s word, ‘to speak to you.’” Joe sat and rolled his eyes at the ceiling."
"“是的，然后呢，乔？请继续说吧。”","“Yes, Joe?Go on, please.”"
"“第二天，先生，”乔看着我，好像我和他相距甚远，说道，“我自己梳洗整洁之后，去见了爱小姐。”","“Next day, Sir,” said Joe, looking at me as if I were a long way off, “having cleaned myself, I go and I see Miss A.”"
"“爱小姐，乔？是郝维仙小姐吗？”","“Miss A., Joe?Miss Havisham?”"
"“先生，我说的是，”乔回答道，他语气中有着法律上的礼节，就好像在立遗嘱一样，“爱小姐，或者是郝维仙小姐。她用这样的强调语气对我说：‘格雷戈里先生。你和皮普先生通信了吗？’因为我那时已经收到了你的一封信，所以我说‘我有过。’（在我和你姐姐结婚的时候，先生，我说‘我愿意’；在我回答你朋友的问题时，皮普，我说‘我有过’。）‘那么你能不能告诉他，’她说道，‘埃斯特拉已经回家了，她很希望见到他。’”","“Which I say, Sir,” replied Joe, with an air of legal formality, as if he were making his will, “Miss A., or otherways Havisham.Her expression air then as follering: ‘Mr. Gargery.You air in correspondence with Mr. Pip?’Having had a letter from you, I were able to say ‘I am.’(When I married your sister, Sir, I said ‘I will;’ and when I answered your friend, Pip, I said ‘I am.’) ‘Would you tell him, then,’ said she, ‘that which Estella has come home and would be glad to see him.’”"
"当我看着乔的时候，我感到自己的脸变红了。我希望我脸红的一个间接原因就是我意识到，要是我知道他的使命的话，我应该给予他更多的鼓励。","I felt my face fire up as I looked at Joe.I hope one remote cause of its firing, may have been my consciousness that if I had known his errand, I should have given him more encouragement."
"“比迪，”乔继续说道，“当我回到家里，叫她拿羽毛笔，我好留字条给你的时候，却遭到了阻止。比迪说，‘我知道他要是能亲耳听到这个消息会很高兴的，现在是假期，你也想见见他，去吧！’我现在可以说，先生，”乔从他的座位上站起来，“皮普，我希望你永远平安、事业兴隆、步步高升。”","“Biddy,” pursued Joe, “when I got home and asked her fur to write the message to you, a little hung back.Biddy says, “I know he will be very glad to have it by word of mouth, it is holiday-time, you want to see him, go!”I have now concluded, Sir,” said Joe, rising from his chair, “and, Pip, I wish you ever well and ever prospering to a greater and a greater heighth.”"
"“但是，现在你要走了是吗，乔？”","“But you are not going now, Joe?”"
"“是的，我要走了。”乔说。","“Yes I am,” said Joe."
"“但是你会回来吃晚饭的是吗，乔？”","“But you are coming back to dinner, Joe?”"
"“不，我不回来了。”乔说。","“No I am not,” said Joe."
"我们的目光相遇，在他向我伸出手来的时候，所有的敬称都在这个有男子气概的心中消融了。","Our eyes met, and all the “Sir” melted out of that manly heart as he gave me his hand."
"“皮普，我的老弟，生命就是由这么多的部分焊接而成的，就像有人是铁匠，有人是锡铁匠，有人是金匠，有人是铜匠一样。像这样的分离肯定是会到来的，而相聚的时刻也是会有的。要是今天发生了什么不愉快的事，错都在我。在伦敦，你和我是走不到一起的。在其他任何地方都不行，除非在自己的家里，我们才会熟知，才被朋友理解。我不是骄傲，但是我想做正确的事，你绝不会再看到我穿这几件衣服了。这几件衣服显得不合时宜。一走出那个铁匠铺，那个厨房或者那片沼泽地，我就到处犯错。要是我穿着铁匠衣服，拿着我的锤子，甚至是叼着烟斗的时候，我连一半的错误都不会犯。假如你愿意来看我，把下巴搭在铁匠铺的窗户上，看乔系着焦黄的旧围裙，做着古老的工作，在那片旧铁砧上打铁的时候，你就不会在我的身上找出那么多错误了。我是一个又糟糕又迟钝的人，但是我希望我最终能一点一点接近正确的事。还有，愿上帝保佑你，亲爱的皮普，老弟，上帝保佑你！”","“Pip, dear old chap, life is made of ever so many partings welded together, as I may say, and one man’s a blacksmith, and one’s a whitesmith, and one’s a goldsmith, and one’s a coppersmith.Diwisions among such must come, and must be met as they come.If there’s been any fault at all today, it’s mine.You and me is not two figures to be together in London; nor yet anywheres else but what is private, and beknown, and understood among friends.It ain’t that I am proud, but that I want to be right, as you shall never see me no more in these clothes.I’m wrong in these clothes.I’m wrong out of the forge, the kitchen, or off th’ meshes.You won’t find half so much fault in me if you think of me in my forge dress, with my hammer in my hand, or even my pipe.You won’t find half so much fault in me if, supposing as you should ever wish to see me, you come and put your head in at the forge window and see Joe the blacksmith, there, at the old anvil, in the old burnt apron, sticking to the old work.I’m awful dull, but I hope I’ve beat out something nigh the rights of this at last.And so GOD bless you, dear old Pip, old chap, GOD bless you!”"
"在我的意识中他身上有一种简单的尊严，这一点我没有错。在他说出这些话的时候，他过时的衣服看起来不再碍眼，反而看上去是一套承载着一个高尚灵魂的衣服。他轻轻地摸了摸我的前额，然后离开了。我一完全恢复意识，就冲了出去，在附近的街上找他，但是他早已经走远了。","I had not been mistaken in my fancy that there was a simple dignity in him.The fashion of his dress could no more come in its way when he spoke these words, than it could come in its way in Heaven.He touched me gently on the forehead, and went out.As soon as I could recover myself sufficiently, I hurried out after him and looked for him in the neighboring streets; but he was gone."
"第二十八章","Chapter 28"
"显然，我第二天必须回到我们的小镇。开始反悔了一会儿之后，我心里很清楚自己必须呆在乔家里。但是，在我预订好明天马车的厢位，并且去过鄱凯特先生家之后，在最后那一刻我却没有被自己的念头打动，我开始编造各种理由作为借口，说服自己应该住在“蓝野猪”饭店。如果住在乔的家里，那样会给他带来不便；或者由于我事先没有打招呼，所以我的床铺可能没有准备好；再或者我可能离郝维仙小姐太远了，而她如此严厉，也许不喜欢这样。所有的骗子相比于欺骗自我的人来说都无足轻重，而我就是这样披着伪装的外衣欺骗自己。这是多么奇怪的事啊。如果我无知地收下了其他人制造出来的二先令六便士的假币，这样还绝对合情合理，但是我却竟然明明知道自己造的是假币，还骗自己说那个是真的！或许会有一个乐于助人的陌生人假装为了安全起见而收起我的钞票，偷偷地抽出那些钞票，给我换成了坚果壳；但是和我的手段比起来，他的这点小把戏又算得了什么呢！因为我是自己收起自己的坚果壳，然后把它们当钞票递给自己！","It was clear that I must repair to our town next day, and in the first flow of my repentance it was equally clear that I must stay at Joe’s.But, when I had secured my box-place by tomorrow’s coach and had been down to Mr. Pocket’s and back, I was not by any means convinced on the last point, and began to invent reasons and make excuses for putting up at the Blue Boar.I should be an inconvenience at Joe’s; I was not expected, and my bed would not be ready; I should be too far from Miss Havisham’s, and she was exacting and mightn’t like it.All other swindlers upon earth are nothing to the self-swindlers, and with such pretences did I cheat myself.Surely a curious thing.That I should innocently take a bad half-crown of somebody else’s manufacture, is reasonable enough; but that I should knowingly reckon the spurious coin of my own make, as good money!An obliging stranger, under pretence of compactly folding up my bank-notes for security’s sake, abstracts the notes and gives me nutshells; but what is his sleight of hand to mine, when I fold up my own nutshells and pass them on myself as notes!"
"在我决定了必须要住到“蓝野猪”饭店之后，关于带不带那个复仇鬼过去的问题却又让我犹豫不决、心神不安。想到能在“蓝野猪”饭店的马房拱道里听到他那双名贵靴子的踩踏声，我就很得意而想带上他。而且想象着他出奇不意地出现在裁缝店里，一定会将特拉布那个不懂礼貌的伙计弄得摸不着头脑时，我几乎都对他肃然起敬了。但另一方面，特拉布的伙计也可能会和他套近乎，和他侃侃而谈。或者就像我认为的那样，这个不计后果、不顾一切的恶棍可能会大喊大叫地把复仇鬼轰到大街上去，这样的话我的女恩主可能会听说这件事，而且会不赞同。所以，最后我决定不带这个复仇鬼去了。","Having settled that I must go to the Blue Boar, my mind was much disturbed by indecision whether or not to take the Avenger.It was tempting to think of that expensive Mercenary publicly airing his boots in the archway of the Blue Boar’s posting-yard; it was almost solemn to imagine him casually produced in the tailor’s shop and confounding the disrespectful senses of Trabb’s boy.On the other hand, Trabb’s boy might worm himself into his intimacy and tell him things; or, reckless and desperate wretch as I knew he could be, might hoot him in the High-street, My patroness, too, might hear of him, and not approve.On the whole, I resolved to leave the Avenger behind."
"我坐的是下午的马车，由于冬季来临，天黑之后的两三个小时我才能到达目的地。我们从“十字钥匙”驿站出发的时间是两点。我由复仇鬼陪伴着，提前一刻钟到了那里——虽然我用了“陪伴”这一表达，但是他要是能选择的话是绝对不会陪伴我的。","It was the afternoon coach by which I had taken my place, and, as winter had now come round, I should not arrive at my destination until two or three hours after dark.Our time of starting from the Cross Keys was two o’clock.I arrived on the ground with a quarter of an hour to spare, attended by the Avenger—if I may connect that expression with one who never attended on me if he could possibly help it."
"在那时，用公共马车载几个罪犯到监狱船那里去是一种惯用的方式。我经常听说这些人能够坐在车厢外，而且不止一次看到他们在大路上坐在车厢顶，摇晃着他们铁一样坚硬的双腿，所以当赫伯特在院子里见到我，跟我说有两个罪犯与我同行的时候，我没有理由感到惊讶。但是出于一个如今已经陈旧的理由，一听到罪犯这个词，我都会不自觉地感到有些畏缩。","At that time it was customary to carry Convicts down to the dockyards by stage-coach.As I had often heard of them in the capacity of outside passengers, and had more than once seen them on the high road dangling their ironed legs over the coach roof, I had no cause to be surprised when Herbert, meeting me in the yard, came up and told me there were two convicts going down with me.But I had a reason that was an old reason now, for constitutionally faltering whenever I heard the word convict."
"“你不介意吧，汉德尔？”赫伯特说。","“You don’t mind them, Handel?” said Herbert. "
"“哦，我不介意！”","“Oh no!”"
"“我觉得你看起来好像不喜欢他们？”","“I thought you seemed as if you didn’t like them?”"
"“我不能假装喜欢他们，而且我想你也不怎么喜欢吧。但是我也不介意。”","“I can’t pretend that I do like them, and I suppose you don’t particularly.But I don’t mind them.”"
"“看！他们就在那里。”赫伯特说，“从小酒吧出来了。这是多么堕落而卑鄙的场景啊！”","“See!There they are,” said Herbert, “coming out of the Tap.What a degraded and vile sight it is!”"
"我想他们一定是请看守喝酒了，因为有一个监狱看守跟着他们，三个人出来的时候都在用手抹着嘴。两名罪犯被拷在了一起，腿上也锁着铁镣铐——这种铁具的样式我可是非常熟悉。他们的着装我也同样熟悉。他们的看守人带着手枪，胳膊下面还夹着一根粗壮的大头棒。但是他们之间却相互理解，保持着良好的关系，两个罪犯在他旁边站着，在一边看着别人套马，那个样子就好像那两个罪犯是一件有趣的展品，但此时还没有正式开放，而他就是馆长。有一个罪犯长得高一些，壮实一些，而且不用说，根据这个世界对于罪犯和自由人的神秘安排，他分配到了一件小号的囚服。他的手脚就像那些巨大的针垫，他的衣服就愚蠢地遮在他的身上，但是我一眼就认出了他那双半闭的眼睛。站在这里的这个人，就是我那个星期六晚上在“三个快活船员”酒馆里看到的那个人，当时他用他那把无形的枪把我击倒了！","They had been treating their guard, I suppose, for they had a gaoler with them, and all three came out wiping their mouths on their hands.The two convicts were handcuffed together, and had irons on their legs—irons of a pattern that I knew well.They wore the dress that I likewise knew well.Their keeper had a brace of pistols, and carried a thick-knobbed bludgeon under his arm; but he was on terms of good understanding with them, and stood, with them beside him, looking on at the putting-to of the horses, rather with an air as if the convicts were an interesting Exhibition not formally open at the moment, and he the Curator.One was a taller and stouter man than the other, and appeared as a matter of course, according to the mysterious ways of the world both convict and free, to have had allotted to him the smaller suit of clothes.His arms and legs were like great pincushions of those shapes, and his attire disguised him absurdly; but I knew his half-closed eye at one glance.There stood the man whom I had seen on the settle at the Three Jolly Bargemen on a Saturday night, and who had brought me down with his invisible gun!"
"很明显，他还没有认出我来，就好像他一生中从没见过我一样。他的目光向我看过来，眼睛打量着我的表链，然后顺带吐了口吐沫，和另外一个罪犯说了几句话，之后两人大笑起来，转过身去，身上的镣铐叮当作响，接着又去看其他东西去了。他们的后背上写着大大的号码，就好像街上的门牌一样；他们外表粗鄙、污秽而笨拙，就好像低等动物一样；他们带着铁镣铐的双腿，可怜地用手帕缠着；而所有在场的人看着他们和躲着他们的样子，让他们（就如赫伯特所说）成了最令人讨厌、最堕落的展览品。","It was easy to make sure that as yet he knew me no more than if he had never seen me in his life.He looked across at me, and his eye appraised my watch-chain, and then he incidentally spat and said something to the other convict, and they laughed and slued themselves round with a clink of their coupling manacle, and looked at something else.The great numbers on their backs, as if they were street doors; their coarse mangy ungainly outer surface, as if they were lower animals; their ironed legs, apologetically garlanded with pocket-handkerchiefs; and the way in which all present looked at them and kept from them; made them (as Herbert had said) a most disagreeable and degraded spectacle."
"但这些还不是最糟糕的事。整个马车的后部都被从伦敦搬来的一家人占据了，所以两个罪犯没有地方坐，只好坐在了前面马车夫后面的位子上。因此，坐在第四个位子上的一位性情暴躁的先生便大发脾气，说让自己与这样的恶棍同行，是违反合约的行为，还说这样非常恶毒、损人、下流而且不体面，除此之外，我也不知道还有什么词可以形容了。这时，马车已经准备就绪，车夫也等得不耐烦了，我们都准备上车，罪犯和他们的看守也过来了——他们带着奇怪的面包肉汤味，还有厚羊毛毯，制绳线和炉底石，这些都是罪犯们带的东西。","But this was not the worst of it.It came out that the whole of the back of the coach had been taken by a family removing from London, and that there were no places for the two prisoners but on the seat in front, behind the coachman.Hereupon, a choleric gentleman, who had taken the fourth place on that seat, flew into a most violent passion, and said that it was a breach of contract to mix him up with such villainous company, and that it was poisonous and pernicious and infamous and shameful, and I don’t know what else.At this time the coach was ready and the coachman impatient, and we were all preparing to get up, and the prisoners had come over with their keeper—bringing with them that curious flavor of bread-poultice, baize, rope-yarn, and hearthstone, which attends the convict presence."
"“不要太在意了。先生，”看守恳求着对这位生气的先生说，“我自己会坐在您旁边的。我不会让他们坐在这一排的。他们不会打扰到您的，先生。你不需要理会他们两个。”","“Don’t take it so much amiss. sir,” pleaded the keeper to the angry passenger; “I’ll sit next you myself.I’ll put ’em on the outside of the row.They won’t interfere with you, sir.You needn’t know they’re there.”"
"“别怪我，”我认出来的那个罪犯抱怨着说，“我可不想去。我可是想留下来的。依我所见，谁来坐我的位子我都欢迎。”","“And don’t blame me,” growled the convict I had recognized.“I don’t want to go.I am quite ready to stay behind.As fur as I am concerned any one’s welcome to my place.”"
"“我也是。”另一个罪犯粗声说，“要是依我的方式的话，我就不会妨碍到你们任何一位了。”然后，他们两个都笑了起来，然后开始磕坚果，把果壳吐得到处都是。要是我站在他们的角度，被别人如此鄙视，我真的觉得我也会这样做的。","“Or mine,” said the other, gruffly.“I wouldn’t have incommoded none of you, if I’d had my way.”Then, they both laughed, and began cracking nuts, and spitting the shells about.—As I really think I should have liked to do myself, if I had been in their place and so despised."
"最后，大家都觉得那位生气的先生没有其他办法了，他要不自认倒霉，和他们坐在一起，要不就留下来。所以，他坐在了他的位子上，嘴里依旧嘟囔着，看守则坐在他旁边的位子，罪犯们费力地把自己的身子拖上了车。我认识的那个罪犯就坐在我的后面，他呼出的气都吹在我的头发上。","At length, it was voted that there was no help for the angry gentleman, and that he must either go in his chance company or remain behind.So, he got into his place, still making complaints, and the keeper got into the place next him, and the convicts hauled themselves up as well as they could, and the convict I had recognized sat behind me with his breath on the hair of my head."
"“再见了，汉德尔！”我们出发时，赫伯特喊道。我想他没有叫我皮普，而给我起了另外一个名字，这是多么幸运啊。","“Good-bye, Handel!” Herbert called out as we started.I thought what a blessed fortune it was, that he had found another name for me than Pip."
"我说不出来我是多么敏锐地感觉到了那个罪犯呼出来的气，那不止是吹到我的后脑勺，而且还渗入到了我整个脊椎。这种感觉就好像辛辣而透彻的酸碰到了我的骨髓，痛得让我牙关打颤。他的呼吸频率似乎比其他人都要高，而且还发出更大的声响。我努力地蜷缩着、抵挡着他，因此感觉到自己一边的肩膀都耸了起来。","It is impossible to express with what acuteness I felt the convict’s breathing, not only on the back of my head, but all along my spine.The sensation was like being touched in the marrow with some pungent and searching acid, it set my very teeth on edge.He seemed to have more breathing business to do than another man, and to make more noise in doing it; and I was conscious of growing high-shouldered on one side, in my shrinking endeavors to fend him off."
"天气非常阴冷，两个罪犯诅咒着寒冷的天气。我们还没有走出很远，就开始瞌睡了，当我们将中途驿站落在身后时，我们习惯性地打着瞌睡，浑身发抖，一声不吭。我则在考虑在我和他分开之前，我是否应该将那两个英镑还给这个罪犯，我思考着怎么做才是最合适的，想着想着，也睡着了。突然，我的身子俯冲了一下，好像我就要在马群中洗澡一样，我就猛地惊醒，又想起了这个问题。","The weather was miserably raw, and the two cursed the cold.It made us all lethargic before we had gone far, and when we had left the Half-way House behind, we habitually dozed and shivered and were silent.I dozed off, myself, in considering the question whether I ought to restore a couple of pounds sterling to this creature before losing sight of him, and how it could best be done.In the act of dipping forward as if I were going to bathe among the horses, I woke in a fright and took the question up again."
"但是我肯定比我想象的睡了更久，因为尽管外面漆黑一片，什么也看不到，但是从断断续续的灯光和我们的灯影里，我认出了满是沼泽地的村庄，它就矗立在扑面而来的湿冷的寒风中。两个罪犯为了取暖，身子前倾，把我当做了御风的屏障，所以我和他们靠得更近了。在我清醒了以后，他们俩说的第一句话就是我脑子里的那几个词，“两张一英镑的钞票”。","But I must have lost it longer than I had thought, since, although I could recognize nothing in the darkness and the fitful lights and shadows of our lamps, I traced marsh country in the cold damp wind that blew at us.Cowering forward for warmth and to make me a screen against the wind, the convicts were closer to me than before.They very first words I heard them interchange as I became conscious were the words of my own thought, “Two One Pound notes.”"
"“他是怎么得到的？”我从没见过的那个逃犯说。","“How did he get ‘em?” said the convict I had never seen."
"“我怎么知道？”另一个回答说，“他不知为何就收起来了。我想是朋友给他的吧。”","“How should I know?” returned the other. “He had ’em stowed away somehows.Giv him by friends, I expect.”"
"“要是，”另一个又狠狠地咒骂了一声天气，说道，“我能拥有那些该多好。”","“I wish,” said the other, with a bitter curse upon the cold, “that I had ’em here.”"
"“是指两张一英镑钞票，还是朋友？”","“Two one pound notes, or friends?”"
"“两张一英镑钞票。我能为了一张一英镑钞票把我所有的朋友都出卖了，我觉得这是一笔很划算的买卖。那么？那么他是说——？”","“Two one pound notes.I’d sell all the friends I ever had, for one, and think it a blessed good bargain.Well?So he says—?”"
"“那么他是说，”我认识的那个罪犯继续说道——“一切都是在半分钟内决定并实行的，就在海盗船的一堆木材后面——‘你就要被释放了？’是的，没错。我能不能找到那个给他饭吃又帮他保守秘密的男孩，给他两张一英镑的钞票？是的，我愿意。所以我就那么做了。”","“So he says,” resumed the convict I had recognized—“it was all said and done in half a minute, behind a pile of timber in the Dockyard—‘You’re a-going to be discharged?’Yes, I was.Would I find out that boy that had fed him and kep his secret, and give him them two one pound notes?Yes, I would.And I did.”"
"“你这个大蠢蛋。”另一个犯人咆哮道，“要是我的话，我就会像个男人一样把它们都花掉，用来大吃大喝。他肯定是个新手。你是说他对你一无所知吗？”","“More fool you,” growled the other.“I’d have spent ’em on a Man, in wittles and drink.He must have been a green one.Mean to say he knowed nothing of you?”"
"“一点都不认识。我们在不同的帮派，关在不同的船上。他又尝试了一次越狱，所以被判无期徒刑。”","“Not a ha’porth.Different gangs and different ships.He was tried again for prison breaking, and got made a Lifer.”"
"“那样可是一种荣耀啊！——在这一带你只做过一次？”","“And was that—Honor!—the only time you worked out, in this part of the country?”"
"“只有一次。”","“The only time.”"
"“你觉得这个地方怎么样？”","“What might have been your opinion of the place?”"
"“一个非常糟糕的地方。泥滩、迷雾、湿地、工作；工作、湿地、迷雾、泥滩。”","“A most beastly place.Mudbank, mist, swamp, and work; work, swamp, mist, and mudbank.”"
"他们都用最恶劣的词语咒骂着这个地方，慢慢地咆哮起来，最后他们自己都没词可骂了。","They both execrated the place in very strong language, and gradually growled themselves out, and had nothing left to say."
"在偷听了这段对话之后，要不是确信那个人没有怀疑我的身份，我就会毫不犹豫地下车，独自留在这漆黑的公路上。的确，我非但在外表上变化很大，而且在衣着上变化也很大，加之环境不同，如果没有意外，他根本就不可能认出我。然而，我们同坐一辆马车的巧合仍然非常蹊跷，以至于让我心中充满一种恐怖的感觉，让我觉得其他的巧合也会发生在我的身上，也许他会听见有人叫我的名字。正因为如此，我下定决心我们一到镇上，我就下车，让自己远离他。我成功地执行了这一策略。我的小旅行皮箱就放在我的脚边，我只需打开铰链就能把它取出来：我把它扔到我的前方，跟着就下了车，于是我就被留在了镇公路的第一块石板的第一盏路灯下。至于那些罪犯，他们跟着马车走了，我在那一刻就知道他们会被押送到河边。在我的想象中，浮现出那条载着罪犯船员的船，停靠在满是污泥的码头上等着他们——耳边又一次听到那粗暴的声音：“你们快划！”就好像是给狗下的命令一样——眼前又看到了邪恶的诺亚方舟，停靠在黑水之上。","After overhearing this dialogue, I should assuredly have got down and been left in the solitude and darkness of the highway, but for feeling certain that the man had no suspicion of my identity.Indeed, I was not only so changed in the course of nature, but so differently dressed and so differently circumstanced, that it was not at all likely he could have known me without accidental help.Still, the coincidence of our being together on the coach, was sufficiently strange to fill me with a dread that some other coincidence might at any moment connect me, in his hearing, with my name.For this reason, I resolved to alight as soon as we touched the town, and put myself out of his hearing.This device I executed successfully.My little portmanteau was in the boot under my feet; I had but to turn a hinge to get it out: I threw it down before me, got down after it, and was left at the first lamp on the first stones of the town pavement.As to the convicts, they went their way with the coach, and I knew at what point they would be spirited off to the river.In my fancy, I saw the boat with its convict crew waiting for them at the slime-washed stairs,—again heard the gruff “Give way, you!” like and order to dogs—again saw the wicked Noah’ Ark lying out on the black water."
"我说不出我在害怕什么，因为我的恐惧大体来说是不明确而模糊的，但是却压在我的心头。就在我走向旅馆的时候，我感到了恐惧，不仅仅是感觉到痛苦或者是害怕被认出来，这种恐惧让我瑟瑟发抖。我现在确信，那种恐惧没有确定的形状，它是童年恐惧的一种短暂的复苏而已。","I could not have said what I was afraid of, for my fear was altogether undefined and vague, but there was great fear upon me.As I walked on to the hotel, I felt that a dread, much exceeding the mere apprehension of a painful or disagreeable recognition, made me tremble.I am confident that it took no distinctness of shape, and that it was the revival for a few minutes of the terror of childhood."
"“蓝野猪”饭店的咖啡厅里空荡荡的，我在那里点了饭菜，坐下来开始吃，直到那时，服务员才认出我来。在他为自己糟糕的记性而道歉了之后，他问我是不是应该叫仆役去给彭波契克先生送个信。","The coffee-room at the Blue Boar was empty, and I had not only ordered my dinner there, but had sat down to it, before the waiter knew me.As soon as he had apologized for the remissness of his memory, he asked me if he should send Boots for Mr. Pumblechook?"
"“不用了，”我说，“当然不要。”","“No,” said I, “certainly not.”"
"这个服务员（就是他在我正式成为学徒的那天传达商人的严重抗议的）表现得非常吃惊，他第一时间给我递过来一张破旧的当地报纸，我拿起报纸，就读到了下面这一段：","The waiter (it was he who had brought up the Great Remonstrance from the Commercials, on the day when I was bound) appeared surprised, and took the earliest opportunity of putting a dirty old copy of a local newspaper so directly in my way, that I took it up and read this paragraph:"
"也许我们的读者不会都对此感兴趣，但是我们要知道本地的一位年轻铁匠神奇般地飞黄腾达了（顺便说一句，这对于我们那位还未街知巷闻却有着魔法之笔的专栏诗人托比而言，是个多么好的话题啊！），而这位青年早期的资助人、同伴和朋友是一位备受尊敬的人物。他与粮食和种子交易有些联系，其非常方便且宽敞的事务所距主街则不超过一百英里。我们称之为我们年轻的忒勒玛科斯的导师。这件事与我们的个人感受不无关联，因为我们知道了，我们的城镇孕育出那位年轻铁匠财富的奠基者，这也是一件很好的事。是不是本地贤人思考的皱眉或淑女有光泽的眼神使某人财运亨通？我们相信昆廷·莫赛斯就是安特卫普的铁匠，此外无需多言。","Our readers will learn, not altogether without interest, in reference to the recent romantic rise in fortune of a young artificer in iron of this neighborhood (what a theme, by the way, for the magic pen of our as yet not universally acknowledged townsman TOOBY, the poet of our columns!) that the youth’s earliest patron, companion, and friend, was a highly-respected individual not entirely unconnected with the corn and seed trade, and whose eminently convenient and commodious business premises are situate within a hundred miles of the High-street.It is not wholly irrespective of our personal feelings that we record HIM as the Mentor of our young Telemachus, for it is good to know that our town produced the founder of the latter’s fortunes.Does the thought-contracted brow of the local Sage or the lustrous eye of local Beauty inquire whose fortunes?We believe that Quintin Matsys was the BLACKSMITH of Antwerp. VERB. SAP. "
"根据丰富的经验，我敢肯定的是，要是到我飞黄腾达的那一日，即便到了北极，我都能在那里见到某些人，无论是爱斯基摩人还是文明人，他们都会告诉我彭波契克是我早期的资助人，是我财富的奠基人。","I entertain a conviction, based upon large experience, that if in the days of my prosperity I had gone to the North Pole, I should have met somebody there, wandering Esquimaux or civilized man, who would have told me that Pumblechook was my earliest patron and the founder of my fortunes."
"第二十九章","Chapter 29"
"我一大早就起床出门了。由于时间太早，所以我还不能到郝维仙小姐家去，于是我就在通往郝维仙小姐家那个方向的区域闲逛——而不是通往乔那里的方向，我可以明天再到乔那里去——我边走边想着我的这位女恩主，想着她为我规划的美好前景。","Be times in the morning I was up and out.It was too early yet to go to Miss Havisham’s, so I loitered into the country on Miss Havisham’s side of town—which was not Joe’s side; I could go there to-morrow—thinking about my patroness, and painting brilliant pictures of her plans for me."
"她已经收养了埃斯特拉，同样也已经收养了我，她一定是打算把我们两个人撮合在一起。她专等我来重建这片荒芜的家园，吸纳阳光照亮黑暗的房间，让停摆的钟重新开始工作，让冰冷的壁炉再次熊熊燃烧，扯下蜘蛛网，清除害虫——总之，就像传说当中的年轻骑士一样，做出一番光辉的事业，然后与公主成婚。经过这片宅邸时，我停下脚步端详着它。它那段由烙红的砖块砌成的围墙，堵塞起来的窗户，还有那些仿佛长着一双精壮、成熟的臂膀、枝条藤蔓甚至爬满烟囱的深绿色常春藤，这一切构成了一个丰富、动人的神秘故事，而我就是这个故事中的英雄。当然，埃斯特拉是这里的灵魂，是这里的核心。但是，尽管她已经完全占据了我的心，尽管我的迷恋与希望都寄托在她的身上，尽管她对我孩童时代的生活和个性的影响是无比强大的，但是除了她自己本身拥有的优秀品质之外，我没有强加给她任何其他的品质，即使在这样一个浪漫的早晨也是一样。我在此提到这一点是有确切目的的，因为这是一条线索，顺着这条线索，你们可以跟随我进入我那不幸的情感迷宫。据我的经验来看，对情人的传统观念并不总是正确的。绝对真实的是，当我以一个男人的情感爱着埃斯特拉的时候，我爱她仅仅是因为我觉得她让人无法抗拒。总之，我时常，甚至是一直都悲痛地意识到，我对她的爱是不理智、不可能、没有安宁、没有希望、没有幸福的，而有的只是无尽的障碍。一旦爱上便无法自拔。假如我真心诚意地相信她是个完美无瑕的人，我会非常爱她。但当我了解了她的缺点之后，我还是会一样地爱她，这丝毫无法克制我对她的爱。","She had adopted Estella, she had as good as adopted me, and it could not fail to be her intention to bring us together.She reserved it for me to restore the desolate house, admit the sunshine into the dark rooms, set the clocks a-going and the cold hearths a-blazing, tear down the cobwebs, destroy the vermin—in short, do all the shining deeds of the young Knight of romance, and marry the Princess.I had stopped to look at the house as I passed; and its seared red brick walls, blocked windows, and strong green ivy clasping even the stacks of chimneys with its twigs and tendons, as if with sinewy old arms, had made up a rich attractive mystery, of which I was the hero.Estella was the inspiration of it, and the heart of it, of course.But, though she had taken such strong possession of me, though my fancy and my hope were so set upon her, though her influence on my boyish life and character had been all-powerful, I did not, even that romantic morning, invest her with any attributes save those she possessed.I mention this in this place, of a fixed purpose, because it is the clue by which I am to be followed into my poor labyrinth.According to my experience, the conventional notion of a lover cannot be always true.The unqualified truth is, that when I loved Estella with the love of a man, I loved her simply because I found her irresistible.Once for all; I knew to my sorrow, often and often, if not always, that I loved her against reason, against promise, against peace, against hope, against happiness, against all discouragement that could be.Once for all; I loved her none the less because I knew it, and it had no more influence in restraining me, than if I had devoutly believed her to be human perfection."
"我调整了步伐，在跟往常一样的时刻来到了大门口。在我用颤抖的手按响了门铃之后，我就转过身去背对着大门，同时好好地喘了几口气，努力让心跳平稳下来。我听见侧门打开的声音，然后是脚步穿过庭院的声音，但是我假装没有听见，即使是铰链转动、大门打开时，我还是假装没听见。","I so shaped out my walk as to arrive at the gate at my old time.When I had rung at the bell with an unsteady hand, I turned my back upon the gate, while I tried to get my breath and keep the beating of my heart moderately quiet.I heard the side door open, and steps come across the court-yard; but I pretended not to hear, even when the gate swung on its rusty hinges."
"最后，有人拍了一下我的肩膀，我吃了一惊，转过身来。然后，我很自然地感到非常吃惊，因为我发现站在我面前的是一个穿着暗灰色衣服的男人。这个人是我最想不到会在郝维仙小姐家门口见到的一个人。","Being at last touched on the shoulder, I started and turned.I started much more naturally then, to find myself confronted by a man in a sober grey dress.The last man I should have expected to see in that place of porter at Miss Havisham’s door."
"“奥立克！”","“Orlick!”"
"“噢，少主人，变化的不光是你啊。请进，请进。主人有令，不能开着大门。”","“Ah, young master, there’s more changes than yours.But come in, come in.It’s opposed to my orders to hold the gate open.”"
"我进去之后，他关上门，锁好并拔出钥匙。“好了！”他自顾自地带我往房子里走了几步之后，转过脸来说道，“我来这里了！”","I entered and he swung it, and locked it, and took the key out.“Yes!” said he, facing round, after doggedly preceding me a few steps towards the house.“Here I am!”"
"“你是怎么到这里来的？”","“How did you come here?”"
"他立即回答道：“我走过来的。我的箱子是用独轮车一起带过来的。”","“I come her,” he retorted, “on my legs.I had my box brought alongside me in a barrow.”"
"“你以后就一直呆在这里吗？”","“Are you here for good?”"
"“我觉得在这里没有什么不好，少主人，是不是？”","“I ain’t her for harm, young master, I suppose?”"
"对这一点我可没有把握。我细细地在脑子里回味他的回答，同时他慢慢地将他沉重的目光从路面移到我的腿上、胳膊上、最后到我的脸上。","I was not so sure of that.I had leisure to entertain the retort in my mind, while he slowly lifted his heavy glance from the pavement, up my legs and arms, to my face."
"“那么，你已经离开铁匠铺了？”我说道。","“Then you have left the forge?” I said."
"“这里看起来像铁匠铺吗？”奥立克回答道，同时带着受伤的神情四下看了看，“说啊，看起来像吗？”","“Do this look like a forge?” replied Orlick, sending his glance all round him with an air of injury.“Now, do it look like it?”"
"我问他离开格雷戈里的铁匠铺有多久了。","I asked him how long he had left Gargery’s forge?"
"“在这里每天都过得差不多。”他回答说，“要是不算一下的话，我也不知道。不过，你离开之后不久，我就到这里来了。”","“One day is so like another here,” he replied, “that I don’t know without casting it up.However, I come her some time since you left.”"
"“这我知道，奥立克。”","“I could have told you that, Orlick.”"
"“噢！”他冷冷地说道，“不过那样的话，你可得是个学问家。”","“Ah!” said he, drily.“But then you’ve got to be a scholar.”"
"这时，我们已经来到房子里。在这里，我发现他的房间就在侧门里面，上面有一个小窗户，对着庭院。房间面积不大，而且看起来跟巴黎看门人通常居住的地方没什么两样。墙上挂着几把钥匙，现在他又把大门钥匙挂了上去。在一个小角落里，或者说是墙壁的凹处摆放着他那满是补丁的床铺。整个屋子看起来杂乱、狭窄、死气沉沉的，就像是一个人形睡鼠的笼子。而他，皮肤黝黑、身材笨重，赫然站在窗边角落的阴影处，看起来就像只人形睡鼠，这个屋子正适合他——因为他确实是只睡鼠。","By this time we had come to the house, where I found his room to be one just within the side door, with a little window in it looking on the court-yard.In its small proportions, it was not unlike the kind of place usually assigned to a gate-porter in Paris.Certain keys were hanging on the wall, to which he now added the gate-key; and his patchwork-covered bed was in a little inner division or recess.The whole had a slovenly confined and sleepy look, like a cage for a human dormouse: while he, looming dark and heavy in the shadow of a corner by the window, looked like the human dormouse for whom it was fitted up—as indeed he was."
"“我以前从没见过这个屋子，”我说道，“但这里以前没有看门人。”","“I never saw this room before,” I remarked; “but there used to be no Porter here.”"
"“以前是没有，”他说，“后来人们都议论说这片房产没人保护会很危险，因为附近会有罪犯、盗贼、流氓等三教九流的人出没。然后我被推荐到这里来，因为我能让那些心怀不轨的人得到应有的教训，所以我就接受了这份工作。这比拉风箱和打铁容易多了——那个可是装了子弹的，那个。”","“No,” said he; “not till it got about that there was no protection on the premises, and it come to be considered dangerous, with convicts and Tag and Rag and Bobtail going up and down.And then I was recommended to the place as a man who could give another man as good as he brought, and I took it.It’s easier than bellowsing and hammering.—That’s loaded, that is.”"
"我的眼睛被挂在壁炉上方的那杆铜皮枪托的长枪吸引住了，而他的眼睛则看着我。","My eye had been caught by a gun with a brass bound stock over the chimney-piece, and his eye had followed mine."
"“哦。”我不想再跟他谈话了，所以我说道，“我能上楼去见郝维仙小姐吗？”","“Well,” said I, not desirous of more conversation, “shall I go up to Miss Havisham?”"
"“要是我知道的话，就烧死我！”他反驳道，同时先是伸展了一下腿脚，又自己晃动了几下，“我的任务就到此为止了，少主人。我用这把锤子敲一下这个铃铛，你就沿着走廊一直走，直到你看见一个人为止。”","“Burn me, if I know!” he retorted, first stretching himself and then shaking himself; “my orders ends here, young master.I give this here bell a rap with this here hammer, and you go on along the passage till you meet somebody.”"
"“我猜她正在等我，是吗？”","“I am expected, I believe?”"
"“要是我能说得准的话，就烧死我两次吧！”他说道。","“Burn me twice over, if I can say!” said he."
"听到这句话，我转身走进那条长长的走廊，我之前第一次走过这条长廊时穿的是我那双厚重的靴子。同时他敲响了铃铛。当钟声还在回响时，我已经来到走廊尽头，在那里我看到了萨拉·鄱凯特，也许是因为我的原因，她整个人看起来青黄相间的。","Upon that, I turned down the long passage which I had first trodden in my thick boots, and he made his bell sound.At the end of the passage, while the bell was still reverberating, I found Sarah Pocket: who appeared to have now become constitutionally green and yellow by reason of me."
"“噢！”她说道，“是你吗，皮普先生？”","“Oh!” said she.“You, is it, Mr. Pip?”"
"“是我，鄱凯特小姐。我很高兴地告诉您，鄱凯特先生和您的家人身体都很好。”","“It is, Miss Pocket.I am glad to tell you that Mr. Pocket and family are all well.”"
"“他们有没有更明白事理一些？”萨拉阴郁地摇了摇头说道，“比起身体好，他们最好更应该明白事理些。唉，马修啊，马修啊！您认识路吧，先生？”","“Are they any wiser?” said Sarah, with a dismal shake of the head; “they had better be wiser, than well.Ah, Matthew, Matthew!You know your way, sir?”"
"这应该没问题，因为我已经很多次在黑暗中爬上这个楼梯了。于是，我穿着比以前轻便得多的靴子爬上了楼，像往常一样敲了敲郝维仙小姐的房门。“皮普的敲门声，”我马上就听见她说话了，“进来，皮普。”","Tolerably, for I had gone up the staircase in the dark, many a time.I ascended it now, in lighter boots than of yore, and tapped in my old way at the door of Miss Havisham’s room.“Pip’s rap,” I heard her say, immediately; “come in, Pip.”"
"她在那张旧桌子旁的椅子上坐着，依旧穿着以前那套礼服，两手交叉着拄在她的拐杖上，下巴放在手上，眼睛看着炉火。坐在她旁边的是一位我从来没有见过的优雅的女士，她手里捧着那只从未穿过的白鞋子，正低头看着它。","She was in her chair near the old table, in the old dress, with her two hands crossed on her stick, her chin resting on them, and her eyes on the fire.Sitting near her, with the white shoe that had never been worn, in her hand, and her head bent as she looked at it, was an elegant lady whom I had never seen."
"“进来，皮普。”郝维仙小姐没有回头，也没有抬头，继续轻声说道，“进来，皮普。你还好吗，皮普？像对待女王那样吻一下我的手吧，好吗——好吗？”","“Come in, Pip,” Miss Havisham continued to mutter, without looking round or up; “come in, Pip, how do you do, Pip?So you kiss my hand as if I were a queen, eh?—Well?”"
"她突然抬眼看着我，而且只是眼睛在动，然后用阴森、戏谑的口气说道：“好吗？”","She looked up at me suddenly, only moving her eyes, and repeated in a grimly playful manner,“Well?”"
"“我收到口信了，郝维仙小姐，”我非常不知所措地说道，“您非常友善地希望我过来看看您，所以我马上就来了。”","“I heard, Miss Havisham,” said I, rather at a loss, “that you were so kind as to wish me to come and see you, and I came directly.”"
"“怎么样？”","“Well?”"
"那位我之前从未见过的女士抬起眼，调皮地看着我，这时我才发现那是埃斯特拉的眼睛。但是她变化太大了，变得更漂亮、更有女人味了，与她这些让人赞叹的惊人进步相比，我的变化根本不值一提。我看着她，觉得自己又无望地变回了那个粗鲁、庸俗的小子。我感到自己与她的距离遥远、差距悬殊，感到她是那样无法企及！","The lady whom I had never seen before, lifted up her eyes and looked archly at me, and then I saw that the eyes were Estella’s eyes.But she was so much changed, was so much more beautiful, so much more womanly, in all things winning admiration had made such wonderful advance, that I seemed to have made none.I fancied, as I looked at her, that I slipped hopelessly back into the coarse and common boy again.O the sense of distance and disparity that came upon me, and the inaccessibility that came about her!"
"她把手向我伸过来。我结结巴巴地说了些“很高兴再次见到你”，“我一直都盼望着这一天”之类的话。","She gave me her hand.I stammered something about the pleasure I felt in seeing her again, and about my having looked forward to it for a long, long time."
"“你发现她变化很大吗，皮普？”郝维仙小姐带着一副贪婪的神情问道，同时用拐杖敲了敲摆放在她们两人之间的一张椅子，示意我在那里坐下来。","“Do you find her much changed, Pip?” asked Miss Havisham, with her greedy look, and striking her stick upon a chair that stood between them, as a sign to me to sit down there."
"“我刚进来的时候，郝维仙小姐，从面容和身材上，我都一点也没有认出来那是埃斯特拉。但是现在，一切都奇妙地变回到从前的——”","“When I came in, Miss Havisham, I thought there was nothing of Estella in the face or figure; but now it all settles down so curiously into the old—”"
"“什么？　你该不会是要说变回了从前的埃斯特拉吧？”郝维仙小姐打断了我的话说道，“她以前很傲慢、无礼，你总是想躲开她。你不记得了吗？”","“What?You are not going to say into the old Estella?” Miss Havisham interrupted.“She was proud and insulting, and you wanted to go away from her.Don’t you remember?”"
"我窘迫地说，那都是很久以前的事了，那时候我根本不懂事，等等。埃斯特拉非常镇静地笑了笑，她说她相信我之前的看法是对的，她以前的确很不友善。","I said confusedly that that was long ago, and that I knew no better then, and the like.Estella smiled with perfect composure, and said she had no doubt of my having been quite right, and of her having been very disagreeable."
"“他变了吗？”郝维仙小姐问她。","“Is he changed?” Miss Havishan asked her."
"“变化很大。”埃斯特拉看着我说道。","“Very much,” said Estella, looking at me."
"“不那么粗鲁，不那么庸俗了？”郝维仙小姐一边说，一边摆弄着埃斯特拉的头发。","“Less coarse and common?” said Miss Havisham, playing with Estella’s hair."
"埃斯特拉笑了一声，接着看着她手里的那只鞋子又笑了一声，然后她看了看我，把鞋子放下了。她仍然把我当成一个小男孩来对待，但她还是那样地吸引着我。","Estella laughed, and looked at the shoe in her hand, and laughed again, and looked at me, and put the shoe down.She treated me as a boy still, but she lured me on."
"我们坐在这间漂亮的屋子里，置身于这个曾经对我影响极大的神秘环境之中。我得知，她刚刚从法国回来，而且即将到伦敦去。她仍然保留着昔日的那份傲慢和任性，但现在她却用这些个性来衬托她的美丽，把它们与她的美丽分离开来是不可能也是不自然的——至少我是这么认为的。一点不错，她的出现让我不能不想起我少年时代心怀的那些对金钱和地位的不幸渴望，这些渴望曾深深地困扰着我。它们带给我无法控制的渴望，让我第一次对家和乔感到羞耻。它们使我产生各种幻觉，我在熊熊燃烧的火焰中看见她的面容，在铁砧的铁板上敲打出她的面容，在夜晚的黑暗当中分辨出她的面容，而她也透过窗户，看着铁匠铺，随即便消失不见了。总之，无论是过去还是现在，我都无法将她与我生命中内心深处的情感分割开来。","We sat in the dreamy room among the old strange influences which had so wrought upon me, and I learnt that she had but just come home from France, and that she was going to London.Proud and willful as of old, she had brought those qualities into such subjection to her beauty that it was impossible and out of nature—or I thought so—to separate them from her beauty.Truly it was impossible to dissociate her presence from all those wretched hankerings after money and gentility that had disturbed my boyhood—from all those ill-regulated aspirations that had first made me ashamed of home and Joe—from all those visions that had raised her face in the glowing fire, struck it out of the iron on the anvil, extracted it from the darkness of night to look in at the wooden window of the forge and flit away.In a word, it was impossible for me to separate her, in the past or in the present, from the innermost life of my life."
"我们约好白天余下的时间我都呆在那里，晚上回旅馆，明天去伦敦。我们交谈了一会儿之后，郝维仙小姐让我们两个人到那个无人打理的花园里去散散步。她说，一会儿回来之后我要像以前那样，推着她转一转。","It was settled that I should stay there all the rest of the day, and return to the hotel at night, and to London tomorrow.When we had conversed for a while, Miss Havisham sent us two out to walk in the neglected garden: on our coming in by-and-by, she said, I should wheel her about a little as in times of yore."
"于是，埃斯特拉和我经过一扇大门进入花园。之前我就是经过这扇大门偶然撞见了那个脸色苍白的年轻绅士，也就是现在的赫伯特。我由于激动而不停地颤抖，完全被她所迷倒了，而她却非常镇静，明显并没有为我而倾倒。当我们走近当时交手的地方，她停下脚步说道：","So, Estella and I went out into the garden by the gate through which I had strayed to my encounter with the pale young gentleman, now Herbert; I, trembling in spirit and worshipping the very hem of her dress; she, quite composed and most decidedly not worshipping the hem of mine.As we drew near to the place of encounter, she stopped and said:"
"“我那时一定得是非常矮小，才能躲起来看到那天的打斗，不过我真的看到了，而且看得很高兴。”","“I must have been a singular little creature to hide and see that fight that day: but I did, and I enjoyed it very much.”"
"“你那天给了我很多奖赏。”","“You rewarded me very much.”"
"“是吗？”她漫不经心地回答道，“我记得当时我非常讨厌你的对手，因为他被带到这里来之后缠着我、叨扰我，让我很是不满。”","“Did I?” she replied, in an incidental and forgetful way.“I remember I entertained a great objection to your adversary, because I took it ill that he should be brought here to pester me with his company.”"
"“他和我现在是非常好的朋友。”","“He and I are great friends now.”"
"“是吗？不过我想起来了，你正在跟着他父亲读书，是吗？”","“Are you? I think I recollect though, that you read with his father?”"
"“是的。”","“Yes.”"
"我不情愿地承认了，因为这让我看起来有些孩子气，而她已经把我当个孩子对待了。","I made the admission with reluctance, for it seemed to have a boyish look, and she already treated me more than enough like a boy."
"“自从你的身份地位改变了之后，你的同伴也改变了。”埃斯特拉说道。","“Since your change of fortune and prospects, you have changed your companions,” said Estella."
"“这是自然的。”我说道。","“Naturally,” said I."
"“而且是必须的，”她用傲慢的口气补充道，“曾经适合你的同伴，如今已经非常不适合了。”","“And necessarily,” she added, in a haughty tone; “what was fit company for you once, would be quite unfit company for you now.”"
"凭良心说，我一点也不确定我心里是否还存留着去见乔的打算，但是即使我有这个打算，也已经被这番话驱散得无影无踪了。","In my conscience, I doubt very much whether I had any lingering intention left, of going to see Joe; but if I had, this observation put it to flight."
"“那时候你一点都不知道自己要交上好运了吧？”埃斯特拉说着轻轻地挥了挥手，示意“那时候”指的是打架的时候。","“You had no idea of your impending good fortune, in those times?” said Estella, with a slight wave of her hand, signifying in the fighting times."
"“一点也不知道。”","“Not the least.”"
"她完美、高傲地走在我的身旁，而我幼稚、顺从地走在她的身旁，我强烈地体会到我们两人之间形成的对比。要不是我知道自己是被选定指派给她的话，这种对比一定会让我非常痛苦。","The air of completeness and superiority with which she walked at my side, and the air of youthfulness and submission with which I walked at hers, made a contrast that I strongly felt.It would have rankled in me more than it did, if I had not regarded myself as eliciting it by being so set apart for her and assigned to her."
"花园里枝叶过于繁茂，遍地杂草丛生，让人无法舒适地散步。我们转了两三圈之后就走了出来，进了那个酿酒作坊的院子。我指着一处对她说，在我来到这里的第一天，我看到她在那里的酒桶上走，她冷冷地随意朝那个方向看了看，说道：“是吗？”我指着另一处，想让她记起当时她从房子里出来后，就是在那里把肉和酒递给了我。而她说：“我不记得了。”“你不记得你把我惹哭了吗？”我说。“不记得了。”她说着摇了摇头，四下看了看。我真的相信，她不记得这一切，而且不在乎这一切。这些让我再一次哭泣，在内心里哭泣——是最撕心裂肺的哭泣。","The garden was too overgrown and rank for walking in with ease, and after we had made the round of it twice or thrice, we came out again into the brewery yard.I showed her to a nicety where I had seen her walking on the casks, that first old day, and she said, with a cold and careless look in that direction, “Did I?”I reminded her where she had come out of the house and given me my meat and drink, and she said, “I don’t remember.”“Not remember that you made me cry?” said I.“No,” said she, and shook her head and looked about her.I verily believe that her not remembering and not minding in the least, made me cry again, inwardly—and that is the sharpest crying of all."
"“你必须知道，”埃斯特拉像任何一个聪慧、美丽的女人一样，高傲地对我说，“我是无心的——所以我记性不好。”","“You must know,” said Estella, condescending to me as a brilliant and beautiful woman might, “that I have no heart—if that has anything to do with my memory.”"
"我好不容易蹦出几个词，意思是说我冒昧地对她说的话表示怀疑。我明白事理。这样美貌的人是不会无心的。","I got through some jargon to the effect that I took the liberty of doubting that.That I knew better.That there could be no such beauty without it."
"“噢！我有一颗可以被刀刺或被枪击的心，这一点我毫不怀疑。”埃斯特拉说，“而且，要是这颗心停止跳动了，我的生命也就停止了。不过你知道我是什么意思。我心里没有柔弱，没有同情，没有伤感，没有那些无聊的东西。”","“Oh! I have a heart to be stabbed in or shot in, I have no doubt,” said Estella, “and, of course, if it ceased to beat I should cease to be.But you know what I mean.I have no softness there, no—sympathy—sentiment—nonsense.”"
"当她静静地站在那里，专注地看着我的时候，我脑中想起了什么？我看到她有什么地方像郝维仙小姐吗？没有。她的某些表情和手势有一点点像郝维仙小姐，就像那些与世隔绝的孩子们会从与之朝夕相处的大人身上学来的那样。当童年过后，两张完全不同的容貌会偶尔产生惊人的相似表情。但是，我却无法将她的表情追溯到郝维仙小姐那里。我又看了看她，尽管她仍然在看着我，但那种表情已经不见了。","What was it that was borne in upon my mind when she stood still and looked attentively at me?Anything that I had seen in Miss Havisham?No.In some of her looks and gestures there was that tinge of resemblance to Miss Havisham which may often be noticed to have been acquired by children, from grown person with whom they have been much associated and secluded, and which, when childhood is passed, will produce a remarkable occasional likeness of expression between faces that are otherwise quite different.And yet I could not trace this to Miss Havisham.I looked again, and though she was still looking at me, the suggestion was gone."
"我看到的是什么呢？","What was it?"
"“我是认真的，”埃斯特拉说道，她并没有皱眉（因为她的额头很平坦），只是脸色阴沉了下来，“如果我们要被凑在一起，你最好马上相信。别说了！”我刚要张嘴说话，她就专横地打断了我，“我没有在任何地方显露过温情。我也没有这样的情感。”","“I am serious,” said Estella, not so much with a frown (for her brow was smooth) as with a darkening of her face; “if we are to be thrown much together, you had better believe it at once.No!” imperiously stopping me as I opened my lips.“I have not bestowed my tenderness anywhere.I have never had any such thing.”"
"随后，我们走进那个荒废已久的酿酒作坊，她指向那个高高的长廊，在我来的第一天，我看见她就是从这个长廊走出去的，她告诉我她从那里走过时看见我惊恐地站在下面。当我的眼睛随着她白嫩的手望去时，那个我无法掌控的、隐隐约约的念头再一次在我脑海中闪现。我不由自主地惊颤了一下，于是她用手扶住了我的胳膊。那个鬼魂立刻又过去了，消失得无影无踪。","In another moment we were in the brewery so long disused, and she pointed to the high gallery where I had seen her going out on that same first day, and told me she remembered to have been up there, and to have seen me standing scared below.As my eyes followed her white hand, again the same dim suggestion that I could not possibly grasp, crossed me.My involuntary start occasioned her to lay her hand upon my arm.Instantly the ghost passed once more, and was gone."
"到底是什么呢？","What was it?"
"“怎么了？”埃斯特拉问道，“你又被吓到了吗？”","“What is the matter?” asked Estella.“Are you scared again?”"
"“如果我相信你刚才说的话，我就应该被吓到。”我回答道，把话题给引开了。","“I should be, if I believed what you said just now,” I replied, to turn it off."
"“那你就是不相信了？很好。不管怎样，我都已经说了。郝维仙小姐不久就会期待你回到老位置上的，不过我觉得你那个老位置和其他陈旧的东西如今都应该搁置一边了。我们再在花园里转一圈，然后就进屋吧。走！你今天可不许因为我的苛刻而掉眼泪了，你是我的仆人，把你的肩膀给我。”","“Then you don’t?Very well.It is said, at any rate.Miss Havisham will soon be expecting you at your old post, though I think that might be laid aside now, with other old belongings.Let us make one more round of the garden, and then go in.Come!You shall not shed tears for my cruelty to-day; you shall be my Page, and give me your shoulder.”"
"她那漂亮的连衣裙一直拖到地上。现在我们走路的时候，她一手提着裙摆，另一只手则轻轻地放在我的肩膀上。我们在杂乱的花园里又转了两三圈，在我看来，花园里却是一片百花盛开的景象。即使是从老墙缝中长出来的青黄杂草，也成为我所见过的最珍贵的花朵，也成为我最珍爱的回忆。","Her handsome dress had trailed upon the ground.She held it in one hand now, and with the other lightly touched my shoulder as we walked.We walked round the ruined garden twice or thrice more, and it was all in bloom for me.If the green and yellow growth of weed in the chinks of the old wall had been the most precious flowers that ever blew, it could not have been more cherished in my remembrance."
"我们之间没有年龄的差异，所以我们不会产生隔阂。我们俩几乎同岁，不过她当然看起来比我年长一些。就在我欣喜不已，同时又信心十足地认为我们的女恩主是特意为我们挑选了彼此的时候，她的美丽以及言谈举止却让她如此难以企及，我因此又痛苦万分。可怜的孩子！","There was no discrepancy of years between us, to remove her far from me; we were of nearly the same age, though of course the age told for more in her case than in mine; but the air of inaccessibility which her beauty and her manner gave her, tormented me in the midst of my delight, and at the height of the assurance I felt that our patroness had chosen us for one another.Wretched boy!"
"最终我们回到了屋子里，这时我非常惊讶地得知，我的监护人刚刚来拜访过郝维仙小姐，处理一点公事，而且还会回到这里来吃饭。我们出去的时候，在那张朽坏了的宴会桌所在的房间里，一盏陈旧且散发着寒光的枝形吊灯已经被点亮了，郝维仙小姐正坐在椅子上等着我。","At last we went back into the house, and there I heard, with surprise, that my guardian had come down to see Miss Havisham on business, and would come back to dinner.The old wintry branches of chandeliers in the room where the mouldering table was spread, had been lighted while we were out, and Miss Havisham was in her chair and waiting for me."
"当我们像以前那样慢慢地绕着新婚宴席的残渣走过的时候，那种感觉就像是正在把椅子推回到过去一样。但是，在这个阴森、凄凉的屋子里，坐在椅子上的那个僵尸般的人用眼睛死死地盯着埃斯特拉，而埃斯特拉看起来却是前所未有的亮丽，让我更加痴迷。","It was like pushing the chair itself back into the past, when we began the old slow circuit round about the ashes of the bridal feast.But, in the funereal room, with that figure of the grave fallen back in the chair fixing its eyes upon her, Estella looked more bright and beautiful than before, and I was under stronger enchantment."
"时间过得飞快，转眼就快到我们用餐的时间了，于是埃斯特拉离开我们去梳洗打扮一下。我们在长桌的中部停了下来，郝维仙小姐从椅子中伸出一只干枯的手臂，将握紧的手放在发黄的桌布上。当埃斯特拉走到门口回头看的时候，郝维仙小姐朝着她吻了一下那只手，脸上是一副可怕的、极度饥饿的神情。","The time so melted away, that our early dinner-hour drew close at hand, and Estella left us to prepare herself.We had stopped near the centre of the long table, and Miss Havisham, with one of her withered arms stretched out of the chair, rested that clenched hand upon the yellow cloth.As Estella looked back over her shoulder before going out at the door, Miss Havisham kissed that hand to her, with a ravenous intensity that was of its kind quite dreadful."
"埃斯特拉离开之后，屋子里只剩下我们两个人，她转过头来小声地对我说：","Then, Estella being gone and we two left alone, she turned to me, and said in a whisper:"
"“她是不是很美、很优雅、身材很窈窕？你喜欢她吗？”","“Is she beautiful, graceful, well-grown?Do you admire her?”"
"“所有人见了她都会喜欢的，郝维仙小姐。”","“Everybody must who sees her, Miss Havisham.”"
"她坐在椅子上，伸出一只胳膊搂住我的脖子，把我的脸拉近她的脸。“爱她，爱她，爱她！她是怎么利用你的？”","She drew an arm round my neck, and drew my head close down to hers as she sat in the chair.“Love her, love her, love her!How does she use you?”"
"在我能够回答之前（其实我根本回答不了这个如此难的问题），她又重复道：“爱她，爱她，爱她！如果她喜欢你，爱她。如果她伤害你，爱她。如果她把你的心撕得粉碎——而随着这份感情越来越久，越来越强烈，伤口也就会越来越深——爱她，爱她，爱她！”","Before I could answer (if I could have answered so difficult a question at all), she repeated, “Love her, love her, love her!If she favors you, love her.If she wounds you, love her.If she tears your heart to pieces—and as it gets older and stronger, it will tear deeper—love her, love her, love her!”"
"我从来没有听她说过这些话，也从没见过她如此地激动、热切。我可以感觉到，搂在我脖子上的那只干瘦的手臂，由于她激动的情绪而肌肉颤动。","Never had I seen such passionate eagerness as was joined to her utterance of these words.I could feel the muscles of the thin arm round my neck, swell with the vehemence that possessed her."
"“听我说，皮普！我收养她是为了让人来爱她。我培养她，教育她，是为了让人来爱她。我把她教养成如今的样子，也是为了让人来爱她。爱她！”","“Hear me, Pip! I adopted her to be loved.I bred her and educated her, to be loved.I developed her into what she is, that she might be loved.Love her!”"
"她一遍一遍地重复这个词，毫无疑问这是她的真心话。但是如果她反复重复的那个词是憎恨而不是爱，而是——绝望——报复——惨死——那么这个词从她嘴里说出来就等于是个诅咒。","She said the word often enough, and there could be no doubt that she meant to say it; but if the often repeated word had been hate instead of love—despair—revenge—dire death—it could not have sounded from her lips more like a curse."
"“我会告诉你，”她用同样急切、激动的口吻小声说，“什么是真正的爱。爱是盲目的忠实，绝对的自辱，彻底的服从、为了依赖和信任而抛弃自我、抛弃全世界，把你整个心、整个灵魂都交给你的爱人——就像我这样！”","“I’ll tell you,” said she, in the same hurried passionate whisper, “what real love is.It is blind devotion, unquestioning self-humiliation, utter submission, trust and belief against yourself and against the whole world, giving up your whole heart and soul to the smiter—as I did!”"
"说到这里，她紧接着发疯似的大喊了一声，我赶紧抱住她的腰。因为她已经从椅子上站了起来，穿着裹尸布般的长裙凭空乱撞，仿佛她马上就要一头撞到墙上，倒地而死一样。","When she came to that, and to a wild cry that followed that, I caught her round the waist.For she rose up in the chair, in her shroud of a dress, and struck at the air as if she would as soon have struck herself against the wall and fallen dead."
"几秒钟之后，这一切都过去了。当我正把她拉回到椅子上时，我闻到一股熟悉的气味。我转过头来，发现我的监护人已走进屋里。","All this passed in a few seconds.As I drew her down into her chair, I was conscious of a scent that I knew, and turning, saw my guardian in the room."
"他总是带着（我想我还没有提过这一点）一块尺寸很大的名贵丝绸手帕，这块手帕在他的职业生涯当中占据着重要地位。我已经见识过他是如何利用这块手帕吓唬客户或者是证人的：先是礼数周全地打开这块手帕，就像是他马上要擤鼻涕了，接着却停住了，仿佛他知道他没有时间擤鼻涕了，因为这个客户或证人马上就要交代实情了，当然，这招过后，他们接着就主动坦白了。当我看到他站在屋子里的时候，他正两手抓着这块富有表现力的手帕，看着我们。一触到我的目光，他那往常的姿态中出现了短暂、无声的停顿，就像显然是在说：“哦？奇怪！”于是这块手帕完美地派上了用场。","He always carried (I have not yet mentioned it, I think) a pocket-handkerchief of rich silk and of imposing proportions, which was of great value to him in his profession.I have seen him so terrify a client or a witness by ceremoniously unfolding this pocket-handkerchief as if he were immediately going to blow his nose, and then pausing, as if he knew he should not have time to do it before such client or witness committed himself, that the self-committal has followed directly, quite as a matter of course.When I saw him in the room, he had this expressive pocket-handkerchief in both hands, and was looking at us.On meeting my eye, he said plainly, by a momentary and silent pause in that attitude, “Indeed?Singular!” and then put the handkerchief to its right use with wonderful effect."
"郝维仙小姐和我同时看到了他，而且（跟所有其他人一样）害怕他。她努力让自己平静下来，然后结结巴巴地说，他跟往常一样总是很准时。","Miss Havisham had seen him as soon as I, and was (like everybody else) afraid of him.She made a strong attempt to compose herself, and stammered that he was as punctual as ever."
"“总是很准时。”他重复着这句话，向我们走了过来，“（你好吗，皮普？我来推你怎么样，郝维仙小姐？再走一圈？）你怎么会在这里，皮普？”","“As punctual as ever,” he repeated, coming up to us.“(How do you do, Pip?Shall I give you a ride, Miss Havisham?Once round?)And so you are here, Pip?”"
"我告诉他我是什么时候到这里的，告诉他郝维仙小姐希望我来看看埃斯特拉。听了我的话，他回答道：“噢！非常漂亮的年轻女士！”然后他用一只大手把郝维仙小姐坐着的椅子推在身前，把另一只手插在裤兜里，仿佛那个裤兜里装满了秘密。","I told him when I had arrived, and how Miss Havisham had wished me to come and see Estella.To which he replied, “Ah!Very fine young lady!”Then he pushed Miss Havisham in her chair before him, with one of his large hands, and put the other in his trousers-pocket as if the pocket were full of secrets."
"“哎，皮普！之前你多长时间见埃斯特拉小姐一次？”他停下脚步说道，","“Well, Pip!How often have you seen Miss Estella before?” said he, when he came to a stop."
"“多长时间见一次？”","“How often?”"
"“嗯！见过几次了？一万次？”","“Ah!How many times?Ten thousand times?”"
"“噢！当然没有那么多次。”","“Oh!Certainly not so many.”"
"“两次？”","“Twice?”"
"“贾格尔斯，”让我大松了一口气的是，郝维仙小姐插进来说道，“别叨扰我的皮普了，和他一起去吃饭吧。”","“Jaggers,” interposed Miss Havisham, much to my relief; “leave my Pip alone, and go with him to your dinner.”"
"他顺从了，于是我们一起摸索着走下了黑暗的楼梯。我们要穿过那个铺了路面的后院，走到那些独立的房屋。在路上的时候，他问我看见过几次郝维仙小姐吃喝，跟以往一样，还是给了我一个选择范围，一百次到一次之间。","He complied, and we groped our way down the dark stairs together.While we were still on our way to those detached apartments across the paved yard at the back, he asked me how often I had seen Miss Havisham eat and drink; offering me a breadth of choice, as usual, between a hundred times and once."
"我想了想，说道：“一次也没有。”","I considered, and said, “Never.”"
"“而且一次也不会看到，皮普。”他皱着眉头笑了笑，回答道，“自从她过上她现在的这种生活以来，她从不允许任何人看见她吃喝。她在夜里游荡，然后看见食物，拿起来就吃。”","“And never will, Pip,” he retorted, with a frowning smile.“She has never allowed herself to be seen doing either, since she lived this present life of hers.She wanders about in the night, and then lays hands on such food as she takes.”"
"“对不起，先生，”我说，“我能问您一个问题吗？”","“Pray, sir,” said I, “may I ask you a question?”"
"“你可以问，”他说，“我可以拒绝回答。说你的问题吧。”","“You may,” said he, “and I may decline to answer it.Put your question.”"
"“埃斯特拉的姓，是郝维仙还是——”我不知道该怎么说下去了。","“Estella’s name.Is it Havisham or—?”I had nothing to add."
"“还是什么？”他说。","“Or what?” said he. "
"“是郝维仙吗？”","“Is it Havisham?”"
"“是郝维仙。”","“It is Havisham.”"
"这时我们来到了饭桌旁，她和萨拉·鄱凯特正在那里等着我们。贾格尔斯先生坐在主位上，埃斯特拉坐在他对面，而我则面对着那位脸色青黄的朋友。我们吃得非常好，侍候我们的是一个女仆，我在这里进进出出这么多次却从来没有见过她。不过我敢肯定的是，她一直以来都呆在这座神秘的房子里。吃过饭后，我的监护人面前摆上了一瓶上等的陈年波尔图葡萄酒（他显然很懂葡萄酒），两位女士起身离席。","This brought us to the dinner-table, where she and Sarah Pocket awaited us.Mr. Jaggers presided, Estella sat opposite to him, I faced my green and yellow friend.We dined very well, and were waited on by a maid-servant whom I had never seen in all my comings and goings, but who, for anything I know, had been in that mysterious house the whole time.After dinner, a bottle of choice old port was placed before my guardian (he was evidently well acquainted with the vintage), and the two ladies left us."
"这座房子里有某种力量使贾格尔斯先生坚决保持沉默，我从没有见过其他任何地方拥有这种力量，即使在他自己身上也不存在。他只关注自己，在整个用餐的过程中，几乎没有看过埃斯特拉一眼。她对他讲话时，他就听着，在适当的时候做出回答，但是从来都不看她，这些我都看在眼里。相反，她却时常用关注和好奇的眼神看着他，神情中没有丝毫的怀疑，但是他的脸上却没有任何察觉到这一点的迹象。在整个用餐过程中，他时常在与我的谈话当中提到我所继承的大笔遗产，这让萨拉·鄱凯特的面色更加青黄，他却冷酷地以此为乐，不过，对于这些，他还是一副毫无察觉的样子，甚至让这些有关遗产话听起来像是他从我幼稚的嘴里套出来的一样——不过他真的套出话来了，尽管我不知道他是如何做到的。","Anything to equal the determined reticence of Mr. Jaggers under that roof, I never saw elsewhere, even in him.He kept his very looks to himself, and scarcely directed his eyes to Estella’s face once during dinner.When she spoke to him, he listened, and in due course answered, but never looked at her, that I could see.On the other hand, she often looked at him, with interest and curiosity, if not distrust, but his face never, showed the least consciousness.Throughout dinner he took a dry delight in making Sarah Pocket greener and yellower, by often referring in conversation with me to my expectations; but here, again, he showed no consciousness, and even made it appear that he extorted—and even did extort, though I don’t know how—those references out of my innocent self."
"当只剩下我们两个人的时候，他坐在那里，一副手中掌握着重大信息的神情，而这种神情却让我承受不了。当他手边没有其他东西可以盘问的时候，他就把玩他的葡萄酒。他对着蜡烛举起酒杯，抿上一口葡萄酒，在嘴里打了一个转，咽了下去，然后又看了看他的酒杯，闻了闻葡萄酒，尝了尝，接着一饮而尽，然后再续满，再盘问般地把玩酒杯，此时我已经非常紧张，仿佛我知道他手里的葡萄酒正在向他透露对我不利的信息。有三四次，我犹犹豫豫地感到自己应该主动和他讲话，但是他一见我要问他问题，就手持酒杯看着我，嘴里含着葡萄酒打转，仿佛是要我意识到这是没用的，因为他不会回答的。","And when he and I were left alone together, he sat with an air upon him of general lying by in consequence of information he possessed, that really was too much for me.He cross-examined his very wine when he had nothing else in hand.He held it between himself and the candle, tasted the port, rolled it in his mouth, swallowed it, looked at his glass again, smelt the port, tried it, drank it, filled again, and cross-examined the glass again, until I was as nervous as if I had known the wine to be telling him something to my disadvantage.Three or four times I feebly thought I would start conversation; but whenever he saw me going to ask him anything, he looked at me with his glass in his hand, and rolling his wine about in his mouth, as if requesting me to take notice that it was of no use, for he couldn’t answer."
"我想鄱凯特小姐已经意识到，看到我会让她有被逼疯的危险，而且可能会撕烂她的帽子——一顶非常丑陋的帽子，就像一只细布拖把——然后在地上撒满她的头发——这些头发肯定从来没有在她头上长长过。所以当我们随后上楼来到郝维仙小姐房间里的时候，她没有出现。于是我们四个人玩起了惠斯特。游戏间歇当中，郝维仙小姐突发奇想，从她梳妆台上拿起一些非常漂亮的饰品戴在埃斯特拉的头上、胸前以及胳膊上，我发现甚至我的监护人也抬起浓密眉毛下的眼睛看了看她，当她的可爱在珠宝亮丽色彩的衬托之下完全展现在他面前的时候，他不禁又抬高了眼睛。","I think Miss Pocket was conscious that the sight of me involved her in the danger of being goaded to madness, and perhaps tearing off her cap—which was a very hideous one, in the nature of a muslin mop—and strewing the ground with her hair—which assuredly had never grown on her head.She did not appear when we afterwards went up to Miss Havisham’s room, and we four played at whist.In the interval, Miss Havisham, in a fantastic way, had put some of the most beautiful jewels from her dressing-table into Estella’s hair, and about her bosom and arms; and I saw even my guardian look at her from under his thick eyebrows, and raise them a little, when her loveliness was before him, with those rich flushes of glitter and color in it."
"我对他打牌的方式和手段简直无话可说，他先吃掉我们的王牌，然后挥手使出不起眼的小牌，在这些小牌面前，我们国王和王后的威风被彻底抹杀了。他把我们三个人看成三个简单、可怜的谜语，而他早就把我们都猜透了，对此我心中的感受也是难以名状的。让我痛苦的是，他冰冷的存在与我对埃斯特拉的感觉格格不入。这种格格不入的感觉并不是因为我知道我永远都受不了和他谈及埃斯特拉，知道我永远都受不了他在她面前把靴子踩得嘎吱嘎吱响，知道我永远都受不了看着他对她撒手不管。而是因为，我的爱慕之情竟然与他近在咫尺，我的真情实意竟然与他共处一地，这才是让人痛苦的情形。","Of the manner and extent to which he took our trumps into custody, and came out with mean little cards at the ends of hands, before which the glory of our Kings and Queens was utterly abased, I say nothing; nor, of the feeling that I had, respecting his looking upon us personally in the light of three very obvious and poor riddles that he had found out long ago.What I suffered from, was the incompatibility between his cold presence and my feelings towards Estella.It was not that I knew I could never bear to speak to him about her, that I knew I could never bear to hear him creak his boots at her, that I knew I could never bear to see him wash his hands of her; it was, that my admiration should be within a foot or two of him—it was, that my feelings should be in the same place with him—that, was the agonizing circumstance."
"我们一直玩到九点，然后做好以下的安排：当埃斯特拉来伦敦的时候，我会事先得到通知，然后到驿站去接她。之后我就跟她握了手，和她道别。","We played until nine o’clock, and then it was arranged that when Estella came to London I should be forewarned of her coming and should meet her at the coach; and then I took leave of her, and touched her and left her."
"我的监护人住在“蓝野猪”饭店中位于我隔壁的那个房间里。深夜，郝维仙小姐所说的“爱她，爱她，爱她！”在我耳中不断回响。我把它们改编成我自己的话，反复地对着枕头说道：“我爱她，我爱她，我爱她！”说了成百上千遍。这时，我心底涌起一股感激之情，因为她竟然会注定和我这个曾经是个铁匠学徒的小子在一起。然后我又在想，她会不会像我所担忧的那样，对这种命运安排根本一点都不高兴、不感激，她何时才会开始对我感兴趣呢？我何时才能唤醒她那颗现在仍然静默而沉睡着的心呢？","My guardian lay at the Boar in the next room to mine.Far into the night, Miss Havisham’s words, “Love her, love her, love her!” sounded in my ears.I adapted them for my own repetition, and said to my pillow, “I love her, I love her, I love her!” hundreds of times.Then, a burst of gratitude came upon me, that she should be destined for me, once the blacksmith’s boy.Then, I thought if she were, as I feared, by no means rapturously grateful for that destiny yet, when would she begin to be interested in me?When should I awaken the heart within her, that was mute and sleeping now?"
"啊，天啊！我自认那些都是高尚而伟大的情感。但是我从来没有觉得我离开乔的行为有任何卑劣和渺小的地方，因为我知道她会鄙视他。仅仅是在一天之前，想起乔我还流下了眼泪，然而眼泪这么快就干了，上帝饶恕我吧！","Ah me! I thought those were high and great emotions.But I never thought there was anything low and small in my keeping away from Joe, because I knew she would be contemptuous of him.It was but a day gone, and Joe had brought the tears into my eyes; they had soon dried, God forgive me!"
"第三十章","Chapter 30"
"早上在“蓝野猪”饭店里，我一边穿衣服，一边认真思考了一番，我决定告诉我的监护人，我认为奥立克并不是一个适合在郝维仙小姐家中担任如此重任的人选。“噢，他当然不是个合适的人选，皮普，”我的监护人对自己早就有的先见之明感到惬意而满足，“因为被委以重任的人从来都不是合适的人选。”看上去他非常兴奋地得知，被委以此项重任的人同样不是一个合适的人选，他洋洋自得地听我跟他讲述我对奥立克的了解。“很好，皮普，”我说完之后，他说道，“我马上过去，给他点钱打发他离开。”这个简短、快速的回应让我非常吃惊，我反而有点犹豫不决，甚至暗示他说，我们这个朋友可是很难对付的。“噢，他不会的。”我的监护人摆弄着他的那块手帕，非常自信地说道，“我倒想看看他如何跟我争辩。”","After well considering the matter while I was dressing at the Blue Boar in the morning, I resolved to tell my guardian that I doubted Orlick’s being the right sort of man to fill a post of trust at Miss Havisham’s.“Why, of course he is not the right sort of man, Pip,” said my guardian, comfortably satisfied beforehand on the general head, “because the man who fills the post of trust never is the right sort of man.”It seemed quite to put him into spirits, to find that this particular post was not exceptionally held by the right sort of man, and he listened in a satisfied manner while I told him what knowledge I had of Orlick.“Very good, Pip,” he observed, when I had concluded, “I’ll go round presently, and pay our friend off.”Rather alarmed by this summary action, I was for a little delay, and even hinted that our friend himself might be difficult to deal with.“Oh no he won’t,” said my guardian, making his pocket-handkerchief-point, with perfect confidence; “I should like to see him argue the question with me.”"
"由于我们中午就会一起乘马车回伦敦，而且整个早餐时间，我都笼罩在彭波契克带来的恐惧当中，以致于我连杯子都拿不起来了，所以我抓住这个机会对他说我想散散步，在贾格尔斯先生处理事情的时候，我就沿着去伦敦的大路走走，请他告诉马车夫一声，赶上我的时候载上我。因此，一吃完早饭我就立刻飞奔出了“蓝野猪”饭店。我绕了一个大约两英里路的大圈子之后，来到彭波契克宅邸后面的旷野上，然后我又绕到大街上，稍稍远离了那个是非之地，这时才感到相对安全了一些。","As we were going back together to London by the mid-day coach, and as I breakfasted under such terrors of Pumblechook that I could scarcely hold my cup, this gave me an opportunity of saying that I wanted a walk, and that I would go on along the London-road while Mr. Jaggers was occupied, if he would let the coachman know that I would get into my place when overtaken.I was thus enabled to fly from the Blue Boar immediately after breakfast.By then making a loop of about a couple of miles into the open country at the back of Pumblechook’s premises, I got round into the High-street again, a little beyond that pitfall, and felt myself in comparative security."
"再一次来到这个宁静、古老的镇上也是饶有趣味的，不时地会突然有人认出我来，盯着我看，但这并没有让我感到厌恶。有一两个商人甚至冲出店铺，在我前面沿街向前走一小段路，接着掉头往回走，就像他们忘记了什么事似的，然后面对面和我擦肩而过——在这种场合下，我不知道是他们还是我的演技更差一些，他们假装什么都没做，而我假装什么也没看见。不过我的地位尊贵，我对此没有任何的不满意，直到命运非让我遇上那个极其卑鄙的家伙，特拉布的伙计。","It was interesting to be in the quiet old town once more, and it was not disagreeable to be here and there suddenly recognized and stared after.One or two of the tradespeople even darted out of their shops and went a little way down the street before me, that they might turn, as if they had forgotten something, and pass me face to face—on which occasions I don’t know whether they or I made the worse pretence; they of not doing it, or I of not seeing it.Still my position was a distinguished one, and I was not at all dissatisfied with it, until Fate threw me in the way of that unlimited miscreant, Trabb’s boy."
"在我前行过程中的某一刻，当我沿街望去的时候，我看到特拉布的伙计正迎面走来，他身上拴着一个蓝色的空袋子。我认为平静而又若无其事地看着他是我最好的办法，也最有可能消除他的邪恶念头的方法。我带着那样的神情往前走着，就在我为自己的成功感到非常庆幸的时候，突然特拉布伙计的两只膝盖一齐打颤，头发直立起来，帽子跌落，四肢剧烈颤抖，他跌跌撞撞地跑到大路上，对着行人喊道：“扶着我！我很害怕！”他假装是因为我高贵地在此出现，从而突然陷入恐慌，悔恨莫及。当我从他身旁经过的时候，他上下牙齿打颤，咯吱作响，他还让自己毫无颜面地拜倒在地。","Casting my eyes along the street at a certain point of my progress, I beheld Trabb’s boy approaching, lashing himself with an empty blue bag.Deeming that a serene and unconscious contemplation of him would best beseem me, and would be most likely to quell his evil mind, I advanced with that expression of countenance, and was rather congratulating myself on my success, when suddenly the knees of Trabb’s boy smote together, his hair uprose, his cap fell off, he trembled violently in every limb, staggered out into the road, and crying to the populace, “Hold me! I’m so frightened!” feigned to be in a paroxysm of terror and contrition, occasioned by the dignity of my appearance.As I passed him, his teeth loudly chattered in his head, and with every mark of extreme humiliation, he prostrated himself in the dust."
"这是一件让人很难忍受的事情，但这还算不上什么。接着，我还没有走出两百码，这时，让我陷入难以名状的恐惧、惊讶及愤怒当中的是，我又看见特拉布的那个伙计迎面走来。他绕过了一个狭窄的拐角。他的蓝色袋子挂在肩上，眼神中闪烁着诚实、勤劳的光芒，步伐轻快、坚定地走向特拉布裁缝店。他发现我之后大吃了一惊，然后就像之前一样发作起来，不过这次他的动作是旋转式的，他跌跌撞撞地绕着我转来转去，两只膝盖弯曲得更厉害了，双手举起好像在祈求怜悯一样。他的痛苦成为一群路人莫大的乐趣，而我却是完全惊慌失措了。","This was a hard thing to bear, but this was nothing.I had not advanced another two hundred yards, when, to my inexpressible terror, amazement, and indignation, I again beheld Trabb’s boy approaching.He was coming round a narrow corner.His blue bag was slung over his shoulder, honest industry beamed in his eyes, a determination to proceed to Trabb’s with cheerful briskness was indicated in his gait.With a shock he became aware of me, and was severely visited as before; but this time his motion was rotatory, and he staggered round and round me with knees more afflicted, and with uplifted hands as if beseeching for mercy.His sufferings were hailed with the greatest joy by a knot of spectators, and I felt utterly confounded."
"我继续沿街前行，还没走到邮局，我又看见特拉布的那个伙计从后面的一条路绕了过来。这一次，他完全变了一副模样。他像我穿大衣那样把蓝袋子披在身上，沿着我对面的人行道，昂首阔步地朝我走过来，身旁是一群兴高采烈的年轻人，他不时地挥手对他们喊道：“我不认识你们！”特拉布的伙计给我带来的恼怒与伤害是无法用言语来表达的，从我身旁经过的时候，他竖起衣领，一手捋着鬓发，一手叉腰，装模作样地笑了笑，扭动着胳膊肘和身体，对他身旁的人拖长腔调慢吞吞地说：“我不认识你们，不认识你们，真的不认识你们！”他随后呱呱叫地追在我身后，给我带来莫大的耻辱，他就这样啼叫着一直把我追过了桥，就像一只非常沮丧的公鸡，而这只公鸡从我还是个铁匠的时候就认识我了。这种耻辱最终一直伴随着我离开这个小镇为止，可以说，我就是被它驱逐到了旷野之中。","I had not got as much further down the street as the post-office, when I again beheld Trabb’s boy shooting round by a back way.This time, he was entirely changed.He wore the blue bag in the manner of my great-coat, and was strutting along the pavement towards me on the opposite side of the street, attended by a company of delighted young friends to whom he from time to time exclaimed, with a wave of his hand, “Don’t know yah!”Words cannot state the amount of aggravation and injury wreaked upon me by Trabb’s boy, when, passing abreast of me, he pulled up his shirt-collar, twined his side-hair, stuck an arm akimbo, and smirked extravagantly by, wriggling his elbows and body, and drawling to his attendants, “Don’t know yah, don’t know yah, pon my soul don’t know yah!”The disgrace attendant on his immediately afterwards taking to crowing and pursuing me across the bridge with crows, as from an exceedingly dejected fowl who had known me when I was a blacksmith, culminated the disgrace with which I left the town, and was, so to speak, ejected by it into the open country."
"然而在这种场合下，除非我能结束特拉布伙计的生命，我真不知道除了忍受我还能做什么。即使是在大街上和他厮打，向他索取任何比他的生命分量轻一点的补偿都是无济于事、有辱我的人格的。而且，他是个没人可以伤害的小子，是一条刀枪不入、躲躲闪闪的大毒蛇，当这条毒蛇被逼到墙角的时候，又会从捕蛇者的两腿间逃走，同时还发出轻蔑的叫声。不过第二天我还是给特拉布先生写了一封信，信中说，皮普先生必须拒绝与他进一步的往来，因为他竟然如此违背自己为社会公益所背负的责任，雇佣了这样一个让每一位体面人士都厌恶的伙计。","But unless I had taken the life of Trabb’s boy on that occasion, I really do not even now see what I could have done save endure.To have struggled with him in the street, or to have exacted any lower recompense from him than his heart’s best blood, would have been futile and degrading.Moreover, he was a boy whom no man could hurt; an invulnerable and dodging serpent who, when chased into a corner, flew out again between his captor’s legs, scornfully yelping.I wrote, however, to Mr. Trabb by next day’s post, to say that Mr. Pip must decline to deal further with one who could so far forget what he owed to the best interests of society, as to employ a boy who excited Loathing in every respectable mind."
"载着贾格尔斯先生的马车如期而至，我又坐上了我的包厢座位，安全地抵达了伦敦——却不是健全地，因为我的心已经不在这里了。我一抵达，为了表示忏悔，就给乔送去一条鳕鱼和一桶牡蛎（作为我自己没有亲自去的补偿），然后就去了巴纳德旅馆。","The coach, with Mr. Jaggers inside, came up in due time, and I took my box-seat again, and arrived in London safe—but not sound, for my heart was gone.As soon as I arrived, I sent a penitential codfish and barrel of oysters to Joe (as reparation for not having gone myself), and then went on to Barnard’s Inn."
"我看到赫伯特正在吃冻肉，他非常高兴地欢迎我回来。派复仇鬼到咖啡屋再去买一份晚餐之后，我觉得我必须在当晚对我的朋友敞开心扉。让复仇鬼呆在大厅里就不可能说知心话了，所谓的大厅只是个仅有一门之隔的前厅，他可以从钥匙孔中听到我们的谈话，所以我让他去看戏去了。我常常要被迫给他找活干，要想证明我其实是被这个工头苛刻地奴役的话，几乎再也拿不出比这种让我丢脸的身份转换更好的证据了。有时我实在无计可施了，就派他去海德公园角去看看当时是几点了。","I found Herbert dining on cold meat, and delighted to welcome me back.Having despatched The Avenger to the coffee-house for an addition to the dinner, I felt that I must open my breast that very evening to my friend and chum.As confidence was out of the question with The Avenger in the hall, which could merely be regarded in the light of an ante-chamber to the keyhole, I sent him to the Play.A better proof of the severity of my bondage to that taskmaster could scarcely be afforded, than the degrading shifts to which I was constantly driven to find him employment.So mean is extremity, that I sometimes sent him to Hyde Park Corner to see what o’clock it was."
"吃过晚饭，我们坐着，把脚放在壁炉挡泥板上，我对赫伯特说：“我亲爱的赫伯特，我有些特别的事情想告诉你。”","Dinner done and we sitting with our feet upon the fender, I said to Herbert, “My dear Herbert, I have something very particular to tell you.”"
"“我亲爱的汉德尔，”他回答说，“我会尊重你的秘密的。”","“My dear Handel,” he returned, “I shall esteem and respect your confidence.”"
"“这涉及到我自己，赫伯特，”我说，“还有另外一个人。”","“It concerns myself, Herbert,” said I, “and one other person.”"
"赫伯特双脚交叉，把头歪向一边看着炉火，茫然地看了一会儿之后又看了看我，因为我没有继续说下去。","Herbert crossed his feet, looked at the fire with his head on one side, and having looked at it in vain for some time, looked at me because I didn’t go on."
"“赫伯特，”我说着把手放在他的膝盖上，“我爱——我爱慕——埃斯特拉小姐。”","“Herbert,” said I, laying my hand upon his knee, “I love—I adore—Estella.”"
"赫伯特没有大吃一惊，反而用一种理所当然的轻松口气说道：“确实如此。怎么了？”","Instead of being transfixed, Herbert replied in an easy matter-of-course way, “Exactly.Well?”"
"“怎么了，赫伯特？你要说的就这些吗？怎么了？”","“Well, Herbert?Is that all you say?Well?”"
"“我的意思是接下来是什么？”赫伯特说，“我当然知道这件事。”","“What next, I mean?” said Herbert. “Of course I know that.”"
"“你怎么知道的？”我说。","“How do you know it?” said I. "
"“我怎么知道的，汉德尔？哎呀，从你那里知道的。”","“How do I know it, Handel?Why, from you.”"
"“我从来没有告诉过你。”","“I never told you.”"
"“告诉过我！你从来没有告诉过我你理过发了，但是我有感觉，能看出来。自从我认识你以来，你就一直爱慕着她。你把你的爱慕和你的旅行箱一起带到这里来了。告诉过我！哎，你一天到晚都一直在告诉我。当你告诉我你自己的故事时，你就明白地告诉我，从你第一次见到她，你就开始爱慕她，那时你还非常年轻。”","“Told me!You have never told me when you have got your hair cut, but I have had senses to perceive it.You have always adored her, ever since I have known you.You brought your adoration and your portmanteau here, together.Told me!Why, you have always told me all day long.When you told me your own story, you told me plainly that you began adoring her the first time you saw her, when you were very young indeed.”"
"“那么，很好，”我说，对我来说，这一点很出乎意料但并不让我讨厌，“我对她的爱慕从来没有停止。她已经回来了，非常漂亮、非常优雅。我昨天看到她了。如果我之前只是爱慕她的话，我现在则是双倍地爱慕她。”","“Very well, then,” said I, to whom this was a new and not unwelcome light, “I have never left off adoring her.And she has come back, a most beautiful and most elegant creature.And I saw her yesterday.And if I adored her before, I now doubly adore her.”"
"“那么，你很幸运，汉德尔，”赫伯特说，“你被挑出来指派给她。不用触犯那些必须避免的问题，我们可以大胆地说，毫无疑问这已是我们俩之间不争的事实了。你知道埃斯特拉小姐对你爱慕她这件事有什么看法吗？”","“Lucky for you then, Handel,” said Herbert, “that you are picked out for her and allotted to her.Without encroaching on forbidden ground, we may venture to say that there can be no doubt between ourselves of that fact.Have you any idea yet, of Estella’s views on the adoration question?”"
"我沮丧地摇了摇头。“哦！她离我上千英里远呢。”我说。","I shook my head gloomily.“Oh!She is thousands of miles away, from me,” said I."
"“耐心一点，我亲爱的汉德尔，时间足够，时间足够。不过你还有话要说是吗？”","“Patience, my dear Handel: time enough, time enough.But you have something more to say?”"
"“我都不好意思说了，”我回答道，“不过说出来比心里想着也糟糕不到哪里去。你把我叫做幸运儿。当然，我是。就在昨天我还是个铁匠的学徒，而今天我就是——我该怎么称呼自己呢？”","“I am ashamed to say it,” I returned, “and yet it’s no worse to say it than to think it.You call me a lucky fellow.Of course, I am.I was a blacksmith’s boy but yesterday; I am—what shall I say I am—today?”"
"“如果你想找个词的话，就说，是个好人吧，”赫伯特笑着用手拍打着我的后背回答道，“一个好人，既急躁又犹豫，既大胆又缺乏自信，既实际又爱幻想，这一切都奇特地融合在你身上。”","“Say, a good fellow, if you want a phrase,” returned Herbert, smiling, and clapping his hand on the back of mine, “a good fellow, with impetuosity and hesitation, boldness and diffidence, action and dreaming, curiously mixed in him.”"
"我沉默了一会儿，思忖着我的性格中是否真的存在这种混合。大体上，我根本不承认这种分析，但又觉得这种分析不值得争辩。","I stopped for a moment to consider whether there really was this mixture in my character.On the whole, I by no means recognized the analysis, but thought it not worth disputing."
"“当我问我如何称呼今天的自己，赫伯特，”我继续说道，“我是想说我自己的想法。你说我很幸运。我知道自己没做任何提升自己社会地位的事情，仅仅凭运气提升了自己，这的确是非常幸运。不过，当我想起埃斯特拉小姐的时候——”","“When I ask what I am to call myself to-day, Herbert,” I went on, “I suggest what I have in my thoughts.You say I am lucky.I know I have done nothing to raise myself in life, and that Fortune alone has raised me; that is being very lucky.And yet, when I think of Estella—”"
"（“你知道，你什么时候能不想呢？”赫伯特插进来说道，他两眼盯着炉火，我认为他的话是善意且充满同情的。）","(“And when don’t you, you know?”Herbert threw in, with his eyes on the fire; which I thought kind and sympathetic of him.)"
"“——那么，我亲爱的赫伯特，我没法告诉你我感到多么着迷，多么茫然，面对着成千上百的机会却抓不住一个。就像你刚刚说的那样，要避开那些忌讳的问题，我仍然要说我所有的前程都依赖一个人（不说这个人的名字）。而且就算从最好的方面来看，仅仅是如此模糊地了解我的前程，这是多么让人不安与不满啊！”说完这些话，我或多或少地消除了一直积压在心头的心事，尽管毫无疑问的是，大部分的心事是从昨天开始积攒起来的。","“—Then, my dear Herbert, I cannot tell you how dependent and uncertain I feel, and how exposed to hundreds of chances.Avoiding forbidden ground, as you did just now, I may still say that on the constancy of one person (naming no person) all my expectations depend.And at the best, how indefinite and unsatisfactory, only to know so vaguely what they are!”In saying this, I relieved my mind of what had always been there, more or less, though no doubt most since yesterday."
"“哎，汉德尔，”赫伯特用他那欢快又充满希望的方式回答道，“在我看来，在对爱情失望时，我们都会拿着放大镜对我们收到的礼物吹毛求疵。同样地，我认为，如果把我们的注意力集中在检查上面，我们就都会忽视其最大的优点。你不是告诉过我说，你的监护人贾格尔斯先生一开始就告诉你说，你得到的不仅仅是遗产吗？而且即使他没有这样告诉过你——不过我承认，这是个很大胆的猜想——你能相信，在伦敦所有人当中，要是贾格尔斯先生对他的依据没有把握的话，他能与你保持目前的这种关系吗？”","“Now, Handel,” Herbert replied, in his gay hopeful way, “it seems to me that in the despondency of the tender passion, we are looking into our gift-horse’s mouth with a magnifying-glass.Likewise, it seems to me that, concentrating our attention on the examination, we altogether overlook one of the best points of the animal.Didn’t you tell me that your guardian, Mr. Jaggers, told you in the beginning, that you were not endowed with expectations only?And even if he had not told you so—though that is a very large If, I grant—could you believe that of all men in London, Mr. Jaggers is the man to hold his present relations towards you unless he were sure of his ground?”"
"我说我无法否认这是个很有力的理由。我说这话的语气（在这种情况下人们常常都这样做）就像是极其不情愿地屈服于事实与真理——就好像我想要否定它似的！","I said I could not deny that this was a strong point.I said it (people often do so, in such cases) like a rather reluctant concession to truth and justice;—as if I wanted to deny it!"
"“我就知道这是个很有力的理由，”赫伯特说，“而且我还知道你很难想出一个更有力的理由来，至于余下的事，你必须等待你监护人的时机，而他则必须等待他委托人的时机。到你二十一岁的时候，你会清楚自己身处何处，而且到那时也许你会得到一些进一步的启发。无论如何，你都会离真相越来越近，因为最终总会真相大白的。”","“I should think it was a strong point,” said Herbert, “and I should think you would be puzzled to imagine a stronger; as to the rest, you must bide your guardian’s time, and he must bide his client’s time.You’ll be one-and-twenty before you know where you are, and then perhaps you’ll get some further enlightenment.At all events, you’ll be nearer getting it, for it must come at last.”"
"“你的性格真是乐观啊！”我说道，同时由衷地钦佩他乐观的处事方式。","“What a hopeful disposition you have!” said I, gratefully admiring his cheery ways."
"“我就应该有乐观的天性，”赫伯特说，“因为我没有太多其他的东西了。顺便说一下，我必须承认，我刚刚所说的话中蕴含的道理不是我自己想到的，而是我父亲的。我曾经听到他关于你的事情所给的唯一一句评论就是这最后一句：‘这件事已经定下来了，否则贾格尔斯先生是不会介入的。’现在，在我更多地谈及我的父亲或我自己，与你坦诚相待之前，我想暂时使自己变得让你非常讨厌——非常厌恶。”","“I ought to have,” said Herbert, “for I have not much else.I must acknowledge, by-the-bye, that the good sense of what I have just said is not my own, but my father’s.The only remark I ever heard him make on your story, was the final one: “The thing is settled and done, or Mr. Jaggers would not be in it.”And now before I say anything more about my father, or my father’s son, and repay confidence with confidence, I want to make myself seriously disagreeable to you for a moment—positively repulsive.”"
"“你不会成功的。”我说道。","“You won’t succeed,” said I."
"“噢，会的，我会成功的！”他说道，　“一，二，三，现在我开始了。汉德尔，我的好兄弟，”尽管他说话语调轻柔，但却非常诚恳，“从我们把脚搭在壁炉挡板上开始说话时起，我就一直在想，如果你的监护人从来没有提及过埃斯特拉小姐的话，那她肯定不是你继承遗产的一个条件。从你所告诉过我的一切当中，根据我理解，他从来没有以任何方式，直接或间接地提过她，是不是？甚至从来都没有什么暗示，比如暗示说你的恩主对你最终的婚姻大事有什么看法，是不是？”","“Oh yes I shall!” said he. “One, two, three, and now I am in for it.Handel, my good fellow;” though he spoke in this light tone, he was very much in earnest: “I have been thinking since we have been talking with our feet on this fender, that Estella surely cannot be a condition of your inheritance, if she was never referred to by your guardian.Am I right in so understanding what you have told me, as that he never referred to her, directly or indirectly, in any way?Never even hinted, for instance, that your patron might have views as to your marriage ultimately?”"
"“从来没有。”","“Never.”"
"“哎，汉德尔，我以我的灵魂和荣誉发誓，我绝不是因为吃不到葡萄就说葡萄酸！既然与她没有固定的关系，你难道不能离开她吗？我告诉过你我会让你讨厌我的。”","“Now, Handel, I am quite free from the flavor of sour grapes, upon my soul and honor!Not being bound to her, can you not detach yourself from her?—I told you I should be disagreeable.”"
"我把头转向一边，因为随着一阵心潮涌动，就像海风吹过古老的沼泽地一样，一种似曾相识的感情再次袭上心头，这种感情正如在我离开铁匠铺的那天早晨，当浓雾升起，我把手放在村口的手指路标上时，心头压抑着的那种感情。我们两人沉默了一会儿。","I turned my head aside, for, with a rush and a sweep, like the old marsh winds coming up from the sea, a feeling like that which had subdued me on the morning when I left the forge, when the mists were solemnly rising, and when I laid my hand upon the village finger-post, smote upon my heart again.There was silence between us for a little while."
"“是的，不过我亲爱的汉德尔，”赫伯特继续说道，仿佛我们没有沉默而是一直在谈话，“这种感情已经如此深地植根于一个男孩心中，这个男孩的天性和境遇让这种感情变得那么浪漫，也让这个问题变得非常严重。想想她受到的教育，再想想郝维仙小姐。想想她是怎样一个人（现在我很可恶，你一定很痛恨我）。这会带来痛苦的结果。”","“Yes; but my dear Handel,” Herbert went on, as if we had been talking instead of silent, “its having been so strongly rooted in the breast of a boy whom nature and circumstances made so romantic, renders it very serious.Think of her bringing-up, and think of Miss Havisham.Think of what she is herself (now I am repulsive and you abominate me).This may lead to miserable things.”"
"“我知道，赫伯特，”我说道，头仍然转向一边，“但我情不自禁。”","“I know it, Herbert,” said I, with my head still turned away, “but I can’t help it.”"
"“你不能让自己离开她？”","“You can’t detach yourself?”"
"“不能。根本不可能！”","“No.Impossible!”"
"“你不能试一试吗，汉德尔？”","“You can’t try, Handel?”"
"“不能。根本不可能！”","“No.Impossible!”"
"“那好吧！”赫伯特说着轻快地摇晃了一下，站了起来，仿佛他之前一直在睡觉一样，他拨了拨炉火，“现在我会尽力让自己再次变得讨人喜欢！”","“Well!” said Herbert, getting up with a lively shake as if he had been asleep, and stirring the fire; “now I’ll endeavor to make myself agreeable again!”"
"于是他在屋子里转了转，拉开窗帘，把椅子各归各位，将胡乱堆放在四处的书摆放整齐，看了看大厅，朝信箱里瞥了几眼，关上了门，然后回到炉火旁边的座位上，坐下之后，两手抱着左腿。","So he went round the room and shook the curtains out, put the chairs in their places, tidied the books and so forth that were lying about, looked into the hall, peeped into the letter-box, shut the door, and came back to his chair by the fire: where he sat down, nursing his left leg in both arms."
"“汉德尔，我要说说我父亲和我自己的事了。恐怕作为我父亲的儿子，我完全没有必要来评论我父亲的成就，但他确实不太会持家。”","“I was going to say a word or two, Handel, concerning my father and my father’s son.I am afraid it is scarcely necessary for my father’s son to remark that my father’s establishment is not particularly brilliant in its housekeeping.”"
"“你家一直很丰裕，赫伯特。”我这么说是想鼓励他。","“There is always plenty, Herbert,” said I: to say something encouraging."
"“哦，是啊！我相信清洁工也会极其赞成地这样说，而且后街那家船具店的老板也会这么认为。严肃点，汉德尔，因为这件事很严肃，你和我一样了解事情的真相。我猜想曾经有段时间，我父亲没有自暴自弃，但即使有这样一段时间，也已经成为过去了。我能不能问问你，在你们村里，你从来有没有机会注意到，婚姻不如意的家庭里的孩子却总是特别急着要成婚？”","“Oh yes! and so the dustman says, I believe, with the strongest approval, and so does the marine-store shop in the back street.Gravely, Handel, for the subject is grave enough, you know how it is, as well as I do.I suppose there was a time once when my father had not given matters up; but if ever there was, the time is gone.May I ask you if you have ever had an opportunity of remarking, down in your part of the country, that the children of not exactly suitable marriages, are always most particularly anxious to be married?”"
"这是个非常奇怪的问题，所以我也只能反过来问他：“是这样吗？”","This was such a singular question, that I asked him in return, “Is it so?”"
"“我不知道，”赫伯特说道，“我也想弄清楚。因为我们确实是这样的。我那可怜的妹妹夏洛特就是个鲜明的例子，她不到十四岁就死了。小小的简也是如此。她渴望成家立业，你可以想到，她短暂的一生就是在一直渴望拥有家庭幸福当中度过的。穿着礼服的小阿利克已经在克佑区为自己找到了合适的伴侣。的确，我想除了宝宝之外，我们都已经订婚了。”","“I don’t know,” said Herbert, “that’s what I want to know.Because it is decidedly the case with us.My poor sister Charlotte who was next me and died before she was fourteen, was a striking example.Little Jane is the same.In her desire to be matrimonially established, you might suppose her to have passed her short existence in the perpetual contemplation of domestic bliss.Little Alick in a frock has already made arrangements for his union with a suitable young person at Kew.And indeed, I think we are all engaged, except the baby.”"
"“那么你也订婚了？”我说道。","“Then you are?” said I."
"“是的，”赫伯特说，“不过这是个秘密。”","“I am,” said Herbert; “but it’s a secret.”"
"我向他保证我会保守秘密，同时求他给我个特权，告诉我更多的细节。他理智又充满感情地谈及我的弱点，所以我想要了解一下他的优点。","I assured him of my keeping the secret, and begged to be favoured with further particulars.He had spoken so sensibly and feelingly of my weakness that I wanted to know something about his strength."
"“我能问一下她的名字吗？”我说。","“May I ask the name?” I said. "
"“名字叫克拉拉。”赫伯特说道。","“Name of Clara,” said Herbert."
"“住在伦敦吗？”","“Live in London?”"
"“是的。也许我应该提一下，”赫伯特说道，从我们进入这一有趣的主题开始，他就很奇怪地变得沮丧又温顺，“她不符合我母亲那种荒谬的门第观念。她的父亲负责管理客轮上的食物供应一类的事情。我想他以前是事务长那一类的人。”","“Yes. perhaps I ought to mention,” said Herbert, who had become curiously crestfallen and meek, since we entered on the interesting theme, “that she is rather below my mother’s nonsensical family notions.Her father had to do with the victualling of passenger-ships.I think he was a species of purser.”"
"“他现在是做什么的？”我说。","“What is he now?” said I. "
"“他现在是个病人。”赫伯特回答说。","“He’s an invalid now,” replied Herbert."
"“现在他生活——？”","“Living on—?”"
"“生活在二楼，”赫伯特说道。这根本不是我想问的，因为我是想问他谋生的方式。“我从来没有见过他，因为自从我认识克拉拉以来，他就一直把自己关在楼上的房间里。但是我时常听见他说话。他会大声咆哮，用一种可怕的工具敲打地板。”他看着我，然后开心地笑起来，此时的赫伯特已经恢复了他往常那种活泼的神情。","“On the first floor,” said Herbert.It was not at all what I meant, for I had intended my question to apply to his means.“I have never seen him, for he has always kept his room overhead, since I have known Clara.But I have heard him constantly.He makes tremendous rows—roars, and pegs at the floor with some frightful instrument.”In looking at me and then laughing heartily, Herbert for the time recovered his usual lively manner."
"“你不想见见他吗？”我说。　","“Don’t you expect to see him?” said I. "
"“哦，想啊，我一直都想见到他，”赫伯特回答说，“因为我一听到他的声音就想他会从天花板上摔下来。不过我不知道那些椽木能支撑多长时间。”","“Oh yes, I constantly expect to see him,” returned Herbert, “because I never hear him, without expecting him to come tumbling through the ceiling.But I don’t know how long the rafters may hold.”"
"当他再一次开心地笑过之后，他又变得很温顺，而且告诉我说他一赚到钱就想跟这位年轻的女士结婚。接着他补充了一个不言而喻的观点，而这个观点让他情绪低落，“但你知道，当你还在四下观望的时候，你不能结婚。”","When he had once more laughed heartily, he became meek again, and told me that the moment he began to realize Capital, it was his intention to marry this young lady.He added as a self-evident proposition, engendering low spirits, “But you can’t marry, you know, while you’re looking about you.”"
"当我们注视着炉火，当我思忖着有时候赚钱是一个多么难以实现的幻想时，我把手插进了我的口袋里。一个口袋里的一张折起来的纸吸引了我的注意力，我打开这张纸，发现是乔给我的一张戏单，这张戏单是关于一位与罗西乌斯齐名的著名地方演员。“上帝保佑啊，”我不由自主地大声说道，“演出是今天晚上的！”","As we contemplated the fire, and as I thought what a difficult vision to realize this same Capital sometimes was, I put my hands in my pockets.A folded piece of paper in one of them attracting my attention, I opened it and found it to be the playbill I had received from Joe, relative to the celebrated provincial amateur of Roscian renown.“And bless my heart,” I involuntarily added aloud, “it’s tonight!”"
"这立刻改变了我们的话题，使我们匆忙决定了要去看演出。于是，为了安慰和鼓励赫伯特，我向他保证，我一定会采用一切可行的或者不可行的方法来帮助他完成婚事。赫伯特告诉我说，他的未婚妻已经听说了我的大名，他应该把我介绍给她认识。然后为了表示我们的相互信任，我们热情地握了握手。在这之后，我们吹灭了蜡烛，给火炉添加了燃料，锁好门，前去探访沃甫赛先生和丹麦王国了。","This changed the subject in an instant, and made us hurriedly resolve to go to the play.So, when I had pledged myself to comfort and abet Herbert in the affair of his heart by all practicable and impracticable means, and when Herbert had told me that his affianced already knew me by reputation and that I should be presented to her, and when we had warmly shaken hands upon our mutual confidence, we blew out our candles, made up our fire, locked our door, and issued forth in quest of Mr. Wopsle and Denmark."
"第三十一章","Chapter 31"
"我们一进入戏剧当中的丹麦王国，就发现这个国家的国王和王后正高高地坐在厨房餐桌旁的扶手椅上，主持朝政。所有的丹麦贵族都在场，包括一位穿着一双大软皮靴的贵族青年，这双靴子是他一位巨人似的祖先留下来的；有一位可敬的贵族，他面容肮脏，好像是在晚年才升为贵族的；还有一位丹麦骑士，他头发中插着一把梳子，腿上穿着一双白色长筒丝袜，整个人看起来一副女人的模样。我那有才华的同乡双臂交叉，忧郁地站在一旁，我本希望他的卷发和额头能更真实一些。","On our arrival in Denmark, we found the king and queen of that country elevated in two arm-chairs on a kitchen-table, holding a Court.The whole of the Danish nobility were in attendance; consisting of a noble boy in the wash-leather boots of a gigantic ancestor, a venerable Peer with a dirty face who seemed to have risen from the people late in life, and the Danish chivalry with a comb in its hair and a pair of white silk legs, and presenting on the whole a feminine appearance.My gifted townsman stood gloomily apart, with folded arms, and I could have wished that his curls and forehead had been more probable."
"随着剧情的发展，一些古怪的小情节显现出来。这个国家已故的先王好像不仅在死时染上了咳嗽，还把这种病带进了坟墓，现在又带了回来。这位王室的幽灵还拿着一本鬼影般的手稿，卷在他的权杖上，他不时地要参考一下手稿，而且越是神情焦急，就越是找不到可以参考的地方，这反而让人觉得他还处在活人的状态之中。我想，正是由于这个原因，顶层楼座的观众才建议这个鬼影说：“换一面！”——这个建议严重地激怒了他。","Several curious little circumstances transpired as the action proceeded.The late king of the country not only appeared to have been troubled with a cough at the time of his decease, but to have taken it with him to the tomb, and to have brought it back.The royal phantom also carried a ghostly manuscript round its truncheon, to which it had the appearance of occasionally referring, and that, too, with an air of anxiety and a tendency to lose the place of reference which were suggestive of a state of mortality.It was this, I conceive, which led to the Shade’s being advised by the gallery to “turn over!”—a recommendation which it took extremely ill."
"他同样想要观众注意到这种威严的气概，尽管他总是表现出一副已经游荡了很长时间、走过很长路程的样子，其实观众看得出他是从旁边紧邻的那面墙后出来的。这使他表现出来的恐惧反而被大家嘲弄。丹麦王后是一位体态很丰满的妇人，尽管根据史实来看，她的肤色无疑应该是黄铜色，但观众认为她身上的黄铜饰品太多了，她的下巴由一根宽宽的黄铜带子连到王冠上（就像她牙齿很疼似的），她的腰上缠绕着另一根宽宽的黄铜带子，两只胳膊上也是各戴着一根黄铜带子，因此她被公开地称作“铜鼓”。那位穿着祖先传下的靴子的贵族青年反复无常地表现自己，一口气扮演了一位能干的水手、一个巡游各地的演员、一个掘墓人、一位牧师、还有一位宫廷击剑比赛中最重要的人物，他目光老练，鉴别力高超，每一个精细的招式都在他的这种威严之下展露无遗。观众渐渐对他忍无可忍，当人们发现他甚至又担任起神职，却拒绝为奥菲莉娅举行葬礼时，终于引发了众怒，观众纷纷向他投掷坚果。最后，奥菲莉娅也成为了受害者，她发疯时的伴奏乐十分缓慢，因此当她最终摘下她那白色的薄纱巾，折叠好，将它埋葬了之后，顶层楼座上一个之前早就不耐烦了、一直把鼻子贴在第一排座位前面的铁栏杆上的男人一脸怒气地咆哮道：“现在孩子都睡着了，大家都去吃晚饭吧！”不管怎样，这声吆喝至少与周围的气氛极不协调。","It was likewise to be noted of this majestic spirit that whereas it always appeared with an air of having been out a long time and walked an immense distance, it perceptibly came from a closely contiguous wall.This occasioned its terrors to be received derisively.The Queen of Denmark, a very buxom lady, though no doubt historically brazen, was considered by the public to have too much brass about her; her chin being attached to her diadem by a broad band of that metal (as if she had a gorgeous toothache), her waist being encircled by another, and each of her arms by another, so that she was openly mentioned as “the kettledrum.”The noble boy in the ancestral boots, was inconsistent; representing himself, as it were in one breath, as an able seaman, a strolling actor, a grave-digger, a clergyman, and a person of the utmost importance at a Court fencing-match, on the authority of whose practiced eye and nice discrimination the finest strokes were judged.This gradually led to a want of toleration for him, and even—on his being detected in holy orders, and declining to perform the funeral service—to the general indignation taking the form of nuts.Lastly, Ophelia was a prey to such slow musical madness, that when, in course of time, she had taken off her white muslin scarf, folded it up, and buried it, a sulky man who had been long cooling his impatient nose against an iron bar in the front row of the gallery, growled, “Now the baby’s put to bed let’s have supper!”Which, to say the least of it, was out of keeping."
"等到我那位不幸的同乡出场时，所有的这些骚动已达到哄闹的程度。每当那位优柔寡断的王子提出一个问题或表示怀疑的时候，观众就帮着他起哄。比如，对于“默默忍受厄运的打击是不是更高贵”这个问题，有人喊“是”，有人喊“不是”，而有人不置可否地说“掷硬币决定”，周围响起了一片争论声。当他自问像他这样的人匍匐于天地之间能做些什么的时候，观众大声附和着他喊道：“对啊，对啊！”当他穿着杂乱不齐的长袜出现在台上时（按照惯例，为了体现长袜的杂乱不齐，就要把袜子上部工整地折叠一下，我觉得这样需要用一块烙铁来熨一下），顶层楼座上的观众又开始你一言我一语地议论他的腿是多么苍白，议论这种苍白是不是因为鬼魂给他带来的惊吓所致。当他拿来竖笛——很像一只刚刚在管弦乐演奏中使用完毕，然后从门口递过来的小黑笛子——观众一致喊着让他演奏一曲《统治不列颠》。当他建议戏子不要那样挥舞手臂时，那个一脸怒气的男人说道：“你也别那样，你比他糟糕多了！”我还要伤心地补充一点的是，每逢这种情况，沃甫赛先生总要被哄笑一顿。","Upon my unfortunate townsman all these incidents accumulated with playful effect.Whenever that undecided Prince had to ask a question or state a doubt, the public helped him out with it.As for example; on the question whether ’twas nobler in the mind to suffer, some roared yes, and some no, and some inclining to both opinions said “toss up for it;” and quite a Debating Society arose.When he asked what should such fellows as he do crawling between earth and heaven, he was encouraged with loud cries of “Hear, hear!”When he appeared with his stocking disordered (its disorder expressed, according to usage, by one very neat fold in the top, which I suppose to be always got up with a flat iron), a conversation took place in the gallery respecting the paleness of his leg, and whether it was occasioned by the turn the ghost had given him.On his taking the recorders—very like a little black flute that had just been played in the orchestra and handed out at the door—he was called upon unanimously for Rule Britannia.When he recommended the player not to saw the air thus, the sulky man said, “And don’t you do it, neither; you’re a deal worse than him!”And I grieve to add that peals of laughter greeted Mr. Wopsle on every one of these occasions."
"不过他面临的最大考验是在教堂墓地那一场戏中：场景好像是在一片原始森林里，一边是一间小小的教会洗衣房，另一边是一扇栅栏门。观众一望见沃甫赛先生穿着一件巨大的黑色斗篷走进栅栏门，就马上友好地警告那个掘墓人说：“小心啊！殡仪员来啦，来查看你的工作干得怎么样啦！”我相信在一个立宪制的国家里，众所周知，沃甫赛先生如果要对着颅骨说教一番，再把它放回原处之后，是不可能不从胸口掏出一块白纸巾擦一擦手指的，然而即使是这样一个无辜又必要的举动还是引来了观众嘲弄的喊声：“伙——计！”安葬尸体时，盛放尸体的黑色空匣子在跌撞之中，盖子被摇晃开了，这让观众一片哄笑，而当人们在抬棺人当中又发现了那个令人讨厌的贵族青年的时候，哄笑声就更甚了。哄笑声一直伴随着沃甫赛先生在交响乐队和坟墓旁边与雷欧提斯决斗的整个过程，直到他把国王刺倒在餐桌下，而他自已也慢慢断了气之后，笑声才平息下来。","But his greatest trials were in the churchyard: which had the appearance of a primeval forest, with a kind of small ecclesiastical wash-house on one side, and a turnpike gate on the other.Mr. Wopsle in a comprehensive black cloak, being descried entering at the turnpike, the gravedigger was admonished in a friendly way, “Look out!Here’s the undertaker a-coming, to see how you’re a-getting on with your work!”I believe it is well known in a constitutional country that Mr. Wopsle could not possibly have returned the skull, after moralizing over it, without dusting his fingers on a white napkin taken from his breast; but even that innocent and indispensable action did not pass without the comment “Wai-ter!”The arrival of the body for interment (in an empty black box with the lid tumbling open), was the signal for a general joy which was much enhanced by the discovery, among the bearers, of an individual obnoxious to identification.The joy attended Mr. Wopsle through his struggle with Laertes on the brink of the orchestra and the grave, and slackened no more until he had tumbled the king off the kitchen-table, and had died by inches from the ankles upward."
"一开始，我们曾尽我们的微薄之力为沃甫赛先生喝彩鼓劲，然而局势毫无希望，我们的努力也没能继续下去。因此我们就坐在那里，对他深表同情，不过也是笑得合不拢嘴。我一直都在情不自禁地笑着，这一切都太滑稽了。不过我有个潜在的印象，那就是在沃甫赛先生的演说当中确实有不错的地方——可惜我这样说并不是因为我们是老相识了，而是因为他说得非常慢、非常阴郁，与任何一个身处任何生死攸关的自然情形之下以任何方式表达自己感情的人都极不相像。当这场悲剧结束，人们朝他叫喊、哄笑的时候，我对赫伯特说：“我们马上走吧，不然我们可能会碰见他。”","We had made some pale efforts in the beginning to applaud Mr. Wopsle; but they were too hopeless to be persisted in.Therefore we had sat, feeling keenly for him, but laughing, nevertheless, from ear to ear.I laughed in spite of myself all the time, the whole thing was so droll; and yet I had a latent impression that there was something decidedly fine in Mr. Wopsle’s elocution—not for old associations’ sake, I am afraid, but because it was very slow, very dreary, very up-hill and down-hill, and very unlike any way in which any man in any natural circumstances of life or death ever expressed himself about anything.When the tragedy was over, and he had been called for and hooted, I said to Herbert, “Let us go at once, or perhaps we shall meet him.”"
"我们拼命跑下楼去，但还是不够快。门口站着一个犹太男人，他那浓浓的眉毛很不自然，就像涂抹上去的一样。我们往前走的时候我就注意到他了，当我们走到他跟前的时候，他说：","We made all the haste we could down-stairs, but we were not quick enough either.Standing at the door was a Jewish man with an unnatural heavy smear of eyebrow, who caught my eyes as we advanced, and said, when we came up with him:"
"“是皮普先生和他的朋友吗？”","“Mr. Pip and friend?”"
"我们承认自己正是皮普先生和他的朋友。","Identity of Mr. Pip and friend confessed."
"“瓦尔登加佛先生，”这个人说道，“希望能有幸见见你们。”","“Mr. Waldengarver,” said the man, “would be glad to have the honor.”"
"“瓦尔登加佛？”我重复道——这时赫伯特在我耳边小声说道：“可能是沃甫赛。”","“Waldengarver?” I repeated—when Herbert murmured in my ear, “Probably Wopsle.”"
"“哦！”我说道，“好吧。我们要跟您走吗？”","“Oh!” said I. “Yes.Shall we follow you?”"
"“就几步路，请吧。”当我们走进边上的一条小巷时，他回过头来问道：“你们觉得他的打扮如何？——是我给他打扮的。”","“A few steps, please.”When we were in a side alley, he turned and asked,“How did you think he looked?—I dressed him.”"
"除了说他穿着丧服之外，我不知道该如何评价他的打扮，他脖子上围着一条蓝色绶带，上面挂着一枚大大的太阳或星星状的丹麦勋章，这让他看起来好像在某个大型的火灾保险公司投过保一样。不过我还是说他看起来很不错。","I don’t know what he had looked like, except a funeral; with the addition of a large Danish sun or star hanging round his neck by a blue ribbon, that had given him the appearance of being insured in some extraordinary Fire Office.But I said he had looked very nice."
"“当他走到墓地里时，”我们的引路者说道，“他很漂亮地展示了他的斗篷。但是，从侧面的角度看，我觉得当他在王后的寝宫里看到鬼魂时，他本应该更好地展示一下他的长统袜。”","“When he come to the grave,” said our conductor, “he showed his cloak beautiful.But, judging from the wing, it looked to me that when he see the ghost in the queen’s apartment, he might have made more of his stockings.”"
"我谦恭地表示了同意，然后我们一起穿过一扇又小又脏的推拉门，随即来到一间像包装箱一样闷热的房间里。沃甫赛先生正在这里脱下他那身丹麦服装，包装箱的大门，或者说是盖子大敞着，这里的空间只够我们把目光越过彼此的肩头来看他。","I modestly assented, and we all fell through a little dirty swing door, into a sort of hot packing-case immediately behind it.Here Mr. Wopsle was divesting himself of his Danish garments, and here there was just room for us to look at him over one another’s shoulders, by keeping the packing-case door, or lid, wide open."
"“先生们，”沃甫赛先生说，“我很荣幸能见到你们。皮普先生，我希望您能原谅我派人请您过来。我很高兴之前就和您相识了，而且戏剧一直都得到了贵族和有钱人的承认。”","“Gentlemen,” said Mr. Wopsle, “I am proud to see you.I hope, Mr. Pip, you will excuse my sending round.I had the happiness to know you in former times, and the Drama has ever had a claim which has ever been acknowledged, on the noble and the affluent.”"
"同时，瓦尔登加佛先生正大汗淋漓地费劲脱下他那件高贵的黑貂皮。","Meanwhile, Mr. Waldengarver, in a frightful perspiration, was trying to get himself out of his princely sables."
"“把长统袜脱下来，瓦尔登加佛先生，”袜子的主人说道，“不然你会把它们撑破的。把它们撑破，你就会丢掉三十五先令。莎士比亚戏剧中从来没有用过比这更好的袜子了。现在你乖乖在你椅子上坐好，让我来给你脱。”","“Skin the stockings off, Mr. Waldengarver,” said the owner of that property, “or you’ll bust ’em.Bust ’em, and you’ll bust five-and-thirty shillings.Shakespeare never was complimented with a finer pair.Keep quiet in your chair now, and leave ’em to me.”"
"说完这些，他双膝跪地开始像剥皮一样给他的受害者脱袜子，脱下第一只袜子的时候，要不是因为房间太小没有足够的空间摔倒的话，沃甫赛先生肯定早就人仰椅翻了。","With that, he went upon his knees, and began to flay his victim; who, on the first stocking coming off, would certainly have fallen over backward with his chair, but for there being no room to fall anyhow."
"直到此时，我都在害怕要对这场戏剧做任何评论。但是，这时，瓦尔登加佛先生沾沾自喜地看着我们说道：","I had been afraid until then to say a word about the play.But then, Mr. Waldengarver looked up at us complacently, and said:"
"“先生们，你们坐在前排，觉得这场戏怎么样？”","“Gentlemen, how did it seem to you, to go, in front?”"
"赫伯特从后面说道（同时捅了捅我）：“好极了。”于是我也说道：“好极了。”","Herbert said from behind (at the same time poking me), “capitally.”So I said “capitally.”"
"“先生们，你们觉得我的角色扮演得怎么样？”瓦尔登加佛先生说道，他那副施恩与人的神情没有十成也有八成。","“How did you like my reading of the character, gentlemen?” said Mr. Waldengrarver, almost, if not quite, with patronage."
"赫伯特从后面说道（同时又捅了捅我）：“大气磅礴、惟妙惟肖。”于是我大胆地说道：“大气磅礴，惟妙惟肖。”就像这都是我发明的词，所以我必须请求大家继续下去一样。","Herbert said from behind (again poking me), “massive and concrete.”So I said boldly, as if I had originated it, and must beg to insist upon it, “massive and concrete.”"
"“我很高兴得到了你们的赞许，先生们，”瓦尔登加佛先生一脸威风地说道，尽管他此时已经仰倒在墙壁上，两手紧紧地抓住椅座。","“I am glad to have your approbation, gentlemen,” said Mr. Waldengarver, with an air of dignity, in spite of his being ground against the wall at the time, and holding on by the seat of the chair."
"“但是我要告诉你一点，瓦尔登加佛先生，”双膝跪地的那个人说道，“你扮演的角色有个缺点。听好了！我不管谁会持不同意见，我还是要告诉你。你把双腿放偏的时候，扮演得就不像哈姆雷特。上一次由我化妆的那个哈姆雷特在彩排的时候也犯下了同样的错误，最后我在他每条小腿上都贴了一大张红封条，在那次彩排中（也是最后一次彩排），先生，我从前排座位跑到幕后，每当他表演时跑偏了位置，我就大喊道：‘我没看到封条！’那天晚上他的表演好极了。”","“But I’ll tell you one thing, Mr. Waldengarver,” said the man who was on his knees, “in which you’re out in your reading.Now mind!I don’t care who says contrary; I tell you so.You’re out in your reading of Hamlet when you get your legs in profile.The last Hamlet as I dressed, made the same mistakes in his reading at rehearsal, till I got him to put a large red wafer on each of his shins, and then at that rehearsal (which was the last) I went in front, sir, to the back of the pit, and whenever his reading brought him into profile, I called out “I don’t see no wafers!”And at night his reading was lovely.”"
"瓦尔登加佛先生对我笑了笑，仿佛在说“他是个忠实的跟班——我不理会他的蠢话”，然后又大声说道：“我的观点对于这里的人来说有点过于优秀，过于有思想了，不过他们会有长进的，会有长进的。”","Mr. Waldengarver smiled at me, as much as to say “a faithful dependent—I overlook his folly;” and then said aloud, “My view is a little classic and thoughtful for them here; but they will improve, they will improve.”"
"我和赫伯特一齐说道：“哦，的确，他们会有长进的。”","Herbert and I said together, Oh, no doubt they would improve."
"“先生们，你们注意到了吗，”瓦尔登加佛先生说道，“顶层楼座上有个人一个劲地嘲笑那场葬礼——我是说，对葬礼的演绎。”","“Did you observe, gentlemen,” said Mr. Waldengarver, “that there was a man in the gallery who endeavored to cast derision on the service—I mean, the representation?”"
"我们恭顺地回答说，好像注意到有这样一个人。我补充说道：“他肯定是喝醉了。”","We basely replied that we rather thought we had noticed such a man.I added, “He was drunk, no doubt.”"
"“哦，先生，没有，”沃甫赛先生说，“没有喝醉。他的雇主会管着他的，先生。他的雇主不会允许他喝醉的。”","“Oh dear no, sir,” said Mr. Wopsle, “not drunk.His employer would see to that, sir.His employer would not allow him to be drunk.”"
"“你认识他的雇主？”我说。","“You know his employer?” said I. "
"沃甫赛先生把两眼闭上，又睁开，两个礼节性的动作都做得十分缓慢。“你们一定注意到了，先生们，”他说，“一个愚蠢又无耻、声音刺耳、表情低俗又恶毒的傻瓜完成了——我可不能说是完美地演绎了——丹麦国王克劳狄斯这一角色（我用了一个法文词汇，请不要见怪）。这就是他的雇主，先生们。就是这样一个职业啊！”","Mr. Wopsle shut his eyes, and opened them again; performing both ceremonies very slowly.“You must have observed, gentlemen,” said he, “an ignorant and a blatant ass, with a rasping throat and a countenance expressive of low malignity, who went through—I will not say sustained—the role (if I may use a French expression) of Claudius King of Denmark.That is his employer, gentlemen.Such is the profession!”"
"我不确定如果沃甫赛先生陷入了绝望之中，我会不会比现更同情他一些，此时我是非常同情他，所以当他转过身去背上背带，也因而把我们挤到门口时，我趁机问了问赫伯特觉得请他去家里吃晚饭怎么样。赫伯特说那样的话很好，因此我邀请了他。于是他把自己用衣服裹得严严实实地和我们一起来到旅馆。我们盛情地款待了他，他一直在那里呆到凌晨两点，大谈他取得的成功并勾画他未来的计划。计划的详细内容我已经忘了，但是我大概记得他一开始会重振戏剧，而最终会毁灭它，随着他的离世，戏剧也会彻底颓败、了无希望。","Without distinctly knowing whether I should have been more sorry for Mr. Wopsle if he had been in despair, I was so sorry for him as it was, that I took the opportunity of his turning round to have his braces put on—which jostled us out at the doorway—to ask Herbert what he thought of having him home to supper?Herbert said he thought it would be kind to do so; therefore I invited him, and he went to Barnard’s with us, wrapped up to the eyes, and we did our best for him, and he sat until two o’clock in the morning, reviewing his success and developing his plans.I forget in detail what they were, but I have a general recollection that he was to begin with reviving the Drama, and to end with crushing it; inasmuch as his decease would leave it utterly bereft and without a chance or hope."
"最后我终于痛苦地爬上床睡觉了，在床上痛苦地想念着埃斯特拉，在梦里我痛苦地看到我得到的所有遗产都是一场空，我不得不与赫伯特的未婚妻克拉拉结婚，我还要扮演哈姆雷特，郝维仙小姐则扮演鬼魂，面对着两万名观众，我却连二十字的台词也说不出来。","Miserably I went to bed after all, and miserably thought of Estella, and miserably dreamed that my expectations were all cancelled, and that I had to give my hand in marriage to Herbert’s Clara, or play Hamlet to Miss Havisham’s Ghost, before twenty thousand people, without knowing twenty words of it."
"第三十二章","Chapter 32"
"有一天，正当我忙着跟随鄱凯特先生读书时，我收到一封邮寄过来的信。我只是看了一眼信封，就立刻陷入了极度紧张的状态之中，因为，尽管我从来没有见过信封上的这种字迹，但我已经猜到这封信是谁写的了。这封信开头并没有写“亲爱的皮普先生”或者“亲爱的皮普”或者“亲爱的某某”，而是这样写道：","One day when I was busy with my books and Mr. Pocket, I received a note by the post, the mere outside of which threw me into a great flutter; for, though I had never seen the handwriting in which it was addressed, I divined whose hand it was.It had no set beginning, as Dear Mr. Pip, or Dear Pip, or Dear Sir, or Dear Anything, but ran thus:"
"“我将在后天乘坐中午的马车到达伦敦。我想之前已经约定好了，你会来接我，是吗？不管怎样郝维仙小姐记得这个约定，我遵照她的指示写信给你。她向你问好。","“I am to come to London the day after to-morrow by the mid-day coach.I believe it was settled you should meet me?At all events Miss Havisham has that impression, and I write in obedience to it.She sends you her regard."
"你的埃斯特拉。”","Yours, ESTELLA.”"
"如果有足够的时间，我也许会为了这个场合订做几套衣服，不过既然时间不够，我也只能凑合着穿那些旧衣服了。接到消息之后我马上变得茶饭不思，一直都心神不宁、坐立不安，直到这一天终于来到了。然而这一天的到来也并没有让我消停下来，因为那时我反而比任何时候都更焦躁。马车还没有从我们镇上的“蓝野猪”饭店出发，我就开始在齐普塞德的伍德大街驿站那里徘徊。尽管我非常有分寸，但仍然觉得每次只要有超过五分钟的时间没有守着驿站，就可能会有闪失。就在这种荒谬的情形之下，我守在那里等了半个小时，而时间却像是过了四五个小时一样。这时，温米克朝我跑过来。","If there had been time, I should probably have ordered several suits of clothes for this occasion; but as there was not, I was fain to be content with those I had.My appetite vanished instantly, and I knew no peace or rest until the day arrived.Not that its arrival brought me either; for, then I was worse than ever, and began haunting the coach-office in wood-street, Cheapside, before the coach had left the Blue Boar in our town.For all that I knew this perfectly well, I still felt as if it were not safe to let the coach-office be out of my sight longer than five minutes at a time; and in this condition of unreason I had performed the first half-hour of a watch of four or five hours, when Wemmick ran against me."
"“嗨，皮普先生，”他说，“你好。我真没想到这是你的地盘。”","“Halloa, Mr. Pip,” said he; “how do you do?I should hardly have thought this was your beat.”"
"我解释说我正在等着接人，那个人会坐马车过来。我向他询问了城堡和那位老人的近况。","I explained that I was waiting to meet somebody who was coming up by coach, and I inquired after the Castle and the Aged."
"“都很好，尤其是我父亲。”温米克说道，“谢谢您。他精神很好。过了下个生日他就八十二了。如果邻居们不抱怨的话，我打算鸣八十二声炮，而且还要我那管炮经得住那么大的压力才行。不过，不适合在伦敦谈这些。你知道我正要去哪里吗？”","“Both flourishing thankye,” said Wemmick, “and particularly the Aged.He’s in wonderful feather.He’ll be eighty-two next birthday.I have a notion of firing eighty-two times, if the neighborhood shouldn’t complain, and that cannon of mine should prove equal to the pressure.However, this is not London talk.Where do you think I am going to?”"
"“去事务所吗？”我说道，因为他正是往那个方向走的。","“To the office?” said I, for he was tending in that direction."
"“是事务所旁边的那个地方。”温米克回答说，“我要去纽盖特监狱。我们现在正在处理一起银行盗窃案，我刚刚去路那头的作案现场看了看，然后我必须要和我们的委托人谈一谈。”","“Next thing to it,” returned Wemmick, “I am going to Newgate.We are in a banker’s-parcel case just at present, and I have been down the road taking as squint at the scene of action, and thereupon must have a word or two with our client.”"
"“你的委托人是那个盗窃犯吗？”我问道。","“Did your client commit the robbery?” I asked."
"“哎呀，天哪，不是的。”温米克非常冷淡地回答道，“但是他被指控为盗窃犯。你和我也有可能被指控。你知道，我们俩都有可能被指控为盗窃犯。”","“Bless your soul and body, no,” answered Wemmick, very drily.“But he is accused of it.So might you or I be.Either of us might be accused of it, you know.”"
"“可是咱们俩都没有遭到指控。”我说道。","“Only neither of us is,” I remarked."
"“是啊！”温米克说着用他的食指戳了一下我的胸口，“你可真聪明，皮普先生！您想看看纽盖特监狱吗？您能抽出时间来吗？”","“Yah!” said Wemmick, touching me on the breast with his forefinger; “you’re a deep one, Mr. Pip!Would you like to have a look at Newgate?Have you time to spare?”"
"我能抽出来的时间实在是太多了，所以这个提议对我来说是个解脱，尽管这与我想守在驿站的潜在欲望相冲突。我喃喃自语地说，我得问一下看是否有时间跟他过去，于是我走进驿站办公室去确认一下时间，那里的职员耐着性子告诉了我那班马车可能到达的最早、最确切的时间——这个时间我跟他一样早就知道了。然后我又回到温米克先生那里，装模作样地看了看表，假装从驿站那里得到的信息让我很惊讶的样子，接受了他的邀请。","I had so much time to spare, that the proposal came as a relief, notwithstanding its irreconcilability with my latent desire to keep my eye on the coach-office.Muttering that I would make the inquiry whether I had time to walk with him, I went into the office, and ascertained from the clerk with the nicest precision and much to the trying of his temper, the earliest moment at which the coach could be expected—which I knew beforehand, quite as well as he.I then rejoined Mr. Wemmick, and affecting to consult my watch and to be surprised by the information I had received, accepted his offer."
"几分钟后我们就来到了纽盖特监狱，门房中光秃秃的墙上挂着一些镣铐，镣铐后面是写在墙上的狱规，我们穿过门房来到监狱内部。那时候，监狱确实是疏于管理，而对各种社会恶行进行激烈回应——对其采取最严厉、最长久的惩罚——的时期还远没有到来。因此，犯人们没有被关押，吃得也比士兵要好（更不用说穷人们了），而且他们很少会以改善伙食为理由放火烧监狱。温米克带我进去的时候正好是探访时间，一个酒馆侍者正在那里卖啤酒，大院铁栅栏后的犯人正在买啤酒，和朋友聊天，一派肮脏、丑陋、杂乱和令人压抑的景象。","We were at Newgate in a few minutes, and we passed through the lodge where some fetters were hanging up on the bare walls among the prison rules, into the interior of the jail.At that time, jails were much neglected, and the period of exaggerated reaction consequent on all public wrong-doing—and which is always its heaviest and longest punishment—was still far off.So, felons were not lodged and fed better than soldiers (to say nothing of paupers), and seldom set fire to their prisons with the excusable object of improving the flavor of their soup.It was visiting time when Wemmick took me in; and a potman was going his rounds with beer; and the prisoners, behind bars in yards, were buying beer, and talking to friends; and a frouzy, ugly, disorderly, depressing scene it was."
"让我印象深刻的是，温米克在犯人们中间走过就像一个园丁在他的植物当中走过一样。我最初产生这种想法是因为当他看到一名犯人，他就像发现一夜之间冒出一棵新芽一样地说道：“什么，汤姆船长？是你吗？啊，真的是你！”接着又说：“储水池子后面的是布莱克·比尔吗？怪不得我这两个月没有看到你了，你怎么样啊？”同样地，从铁栅栏外走过时，他还会停下来听那些犯人焦急地对他窃窃私语——总是一个接着一个地——温米克张着邮筒般的嘴巴，一动不动，谈话的时候看着他们，仿佛他特别在意自从上次见面之后他们都取得了哪些进展，使得他们能精神饱满地接受审判。","It struck me that Wemmick walked among the prisoners, much as a gardener might walk among his plants.This was first put into my head by his seeing a shoot that had come up in the night, and saying, “What, Captain Tom?Are you there?Ah, indeed!” and also, “Is that Black Bill behind the cistern?Why I didn’t look for you these two months; how do you find yourself?”Equally in his stopping at the bars and attending to anxious whisperers—always singly—Wemmick with his post-office in an immovable state, looked at them while in conference, as if he were taking particular notice of the advance they had made, since last observed, towards coming out in full blow at their trial."
"他非常受欢迎，而且我发现他是贾格尔斯先生生意当中的联络人，他身上也有贾格尔斯先生的某种特点，因此与他交往时不可超越某个界限。接下来他与每一位委托人碰面时的举动都包括点一下头，用两手轻轻摆正一下头顶的帽子，然后闭紧邮筒式的嘴巴，接着把手放进口袋里。有一两次，当委托人在筹措费用上遇到困难的时候，这时温米克就尽可能远地推开那笔筹来的不够数的费用，说道：“没用的，孩子。我只是个下属。我可不能收下。别和一个下属来这一套。孩子，要是你筹不到足够的钱，你最好另找一位大律师来替你说理吧，你知道，这一行有许多大律师，这些钱雇不起这一个律师，却可能雇得起另外一个律师，这是我作为一个下属给你的建议。别做些没用的事啦。何必呢？好了，下一个是谁？”","He was highly popular, and I found that he took the familiar department of Mr. Jaggers’ business: though something of the state of Mr. Jaggers hung about him too, forbidding approach beyond certain limits.His personal recognition of each successive client was comprised in a nod, and in his settling his hat a little easier on his head with both hands, and then tightening the postoffice, and putting his hands in his pockets.In one or two instances, there was a difficulty respecting the raising of fees, and then Mr. Wemmick, backing as far as possible from the insufficient money produced, said, “it’s no use, my boy.I’m only a subordinate.I can’t take it.Don’t go on in that way with a subordinate.If you are unable to make up your quantum, my boy, you had better address yourself to a principal; there are plenty of principals in the profession, you know, and what is not worth the while of one, may be worth the while of another; that’s my recommendation to you, speaking as a subordinate.Don’t try on useless measures.Why should you?Now, who’s next?”"
"就这样，我们在温米克的花房当中走着，突然他转过来对我说：“注意那个我要和他握手的人。”就算没有他的提醒，我也会这么做的，因为到此时为止，他还没有和任何人握过手。","Thus, we walked through Wemmick’s greenhouse, until he turned to me and said, “Notice the man I shall shake hands with.”I should have done so, without the preparation, as he had shaken hands with no one yet."
"几乎就在他话音刚落的时候，一个魁梧、挺拔的男人出现了（现在在我写下这些的时候，他的模样仍清晰可见），他身穿一件破旧的橄榄绿色长礼服，红通通的肤色当中透出一种古怪的苍白，两眼乱转，想要定格在某个事物上面。他走到铁栅栏后面的一个拐角处，把手放在帽子上——帽子表面就像洒了冷肉汤一样油腻多脂——然后半认真、半开玩笑地行了一个军礼。","Almost as soon as he had spoken, a portly upright man (whom I can see now, as I write) in a well-worn olive-colored frock-coat, with a peculiar pallor over-spreading the red in his complexion, and eyes that went wandering about when he tried to fix them, came up to a corner of the bars, and put his hand to his hat—which had a greasy and fatty surface like cold broth—with a half-serious and half-jocose military salute."
"“上校，向您致敬！”温米克说道，“您好吗？”","“Colonel, to you!” said Wemmick; “how are you, Colonel?”"
"“很好，温米克先生。”","“All right, Mr. Wemmick.”"
"“该做的事情都已经做了，但是证据对我们太不利了，上校。”","“Everything was done that could be done, but the evidence was too strong for us, Colonel.”"
"“是的，证据太充分了，先生——不过，我不在乎。”","“Yes, it was too strong, sir—but I don’t care.”"
"“是啊，是啊，”温米克冷冷地说道，“你不在乎。”然后他转过身来对我说：“这个人曾经是一名皇家军人。他曾是个在编的士兵，之后花钱办了退役。”","“No, no,” said Wemmick, coolly, “you don’t care.”Then, turning to me, “Served His Majesty this man.Was a soldier in the line and bought his discharge.”"
"我说：“真的？”这个人拿眼睛看了看我，又看了看我的头，接着全身上下打量了我一番，然后用手捂着嘴笑了笑。","I said, “Indeed?” and the man’s eyes looked at me, and then looked over my head, and then looked all round me, and then he drew his hand across his lips and laughed."
"“我想我星期一就能从这里脱身了，先生。”他对温米克说。","“I think I shall be out of this on Monday, sir,” he said to Wemmick."
"“也许吧，”我的朋友回答说，“但不能确定。”","“Perhaps,” returned my friend, “but there’s no knowing.”"
"“我很高兴能有这个机会和你说声再见，温米克先生，”这个人说着从铁栅栏中伸出一只手。","“I am glad to have the chance of bidding you good-bye, Mr. Wemmick,” said the man, stretching out his hand between two bars."
"“谢谢。”温米克说道，然后和他握了握手，“我也很高兴能和你告别，上校。”","“Thankye,” said Wemmick, shaking hands with him.“Same to you, Colonel.”"
"“如果我被抓的时候身上带的是真货，温米克先生，”这个人说道，同时仍然不愿放开他的手，“我早就会请您赏脸再戴一枚戒指了——以此来感谢您对我的关注。”","“If what I had upon me when taken, had been real, Mr. Wemmick,” said the man, unwilling to let his hand go, “I should have asked the favour of your wearing another ring—in acknowledgment of your attentions.”"
"“这份情我心领了。”温米克说，“顺便提一句，你曾经对养鸽子非常入迷吧？”那个人听后抬起头看了看天空。“我听说你喂养了一群品种很好的鸽子。如果你以后不需要这些鸽子的话，你能不能委托你的朋友给我带两只过来？”","“I’ll accept the will for the deed,” said Wemmick.“By-the-bye; you were quite a pigeon-fancier.”The man looked up at the sky.“I am told you had a remarkable breed of tumblers.Could you commission any friend of yours to bring me a pair, of you’ve no further use for ’em?”"
"“一定办到，先生。”","“It shall be done, sir?”"
"“好吧，”温米克说，“它们会得到很好的照顾的。下午安好，上校。再见！”他们又握了握手，当我们离开的时候，温米克对我说：“一个造假币的，手段非常高明。刑事法官今天做出了判决，他星期一肯定会被行刑。不过你知道，尽管如此，就目前的情况来看，一对鸽子也是动产。”说完这些，他回头看了看，对那株即将死去的植物点了点头，然后一路东张西望地走出了院子，仿佛在考虑另外有哪一盆花草最适合代替它的位置。","“All right,” said Wemmick, “they shall be taken care of.Good afternoon, Colonel.Good-bye!”They shook hands again, and as we walked away Wemmick said to me, “A Coiner, a very good workman.The Recorder’s report is made to-day, and he is sure to be executed on Monday.Still you see, as far as it goes, a pair of pigeons are portable property, all the same.”With that, he looked back, and nodded at this dead plant, and then cast his eyes about him in walking out of the yard, as if he were considering what other pot would go best in its place."
"当我们经过门房走出监狱的时候，我发现那些监狱看守跟他们看管的那些犯人们一样，对我的监护人极其重视。“嗯，温米克先生，”一个监狱看守正带着我们走过两扇铆了尖钉的大门，他小心地锁好其中一扇，却没有打开另一扇，而是说道，“贾格尔斯先生打算如何办理那个河滨杀人案件？他打算说成是过失杀人罪吗？还是其他的罪名？”","As we came out of the prison through the lodge, I found that the great importance of my guardian was appreciated by the turnkeys, no less than by those whom they held in charge.“Well, Mr. Wemmick,” said the turnkey, who kept us between the two studded and spiked lodge gates, and who carefully locked one before he unlocked the other, “what’s Mr. Jaggers going to do with that waterside murder?Is he going to make it manslaughter, or what’s he going to make of it?”"
"“你为什么不问问他？”温米克回答说。","“Why don’t you ask him?” returned Wemmick. "
"“哦，是啊，我想也是！”这个监狱看守说道。","“Oh yes, I dare say!” said the turnkey. "
"“看吧，他们这里的人就是这样。皮普先生，”温米克拉长他那邮筒般的嘴巴转过身来对我说，“他们不介意对我这样一个下属提问题，但是你从来都看不到他们向我的大律师提问题。”","“Now, that’s the way with them here.Mr. Pip,” remarked Wemmick, turning to me with his post-office elongated.“They don’t mind what they ask of me, the subordinate; but you’ll never catch ’em asking any questions of my principal.”"
"“这个年轻人是您事务所里的学徒或签约实习生吗？”这个监狱看守对温米克幽默的话付之一笑，同时又这样问道。","“Is this young gentleman one of the ’prentices or articled ones of your office?” asked the turnkey, with a grin at Mr. Wemmick’s humor."
"“你看，他又来了！”温米克喊道，“我说的没错吧！他那第一个问题话音还未落，就又抛给我这个下属另一个问题！好吧，就当皮普先生是一个学徒，那又如何？”","“There he goes again, you see!” cried Wemmick, “I told you so!Asks another question of the subordinate before his first is dry!Well, supposing Mr. Pip is one of them?”"
"“那样的话，”这个看守又露齿而笑，同时说道，“他就了解贾格尔斯先生是怎样的人了。”","“Why then,” said the turnkey, grinning again, “he knows what Mr. Jaggers is.”"
"“哈！”温米克喊道，同时突然开玩笑地打了那个监狱看守一下，“你一跟我的老板打交道就变得跟你自己那些监狱钥匙一样哑口无言了，你自己也是知道的。放我们出去，你这个老狐狸，不然我就让他以非法监禁的罪名告你。”","“Yah!” cried Wemmick, suddenly hitting out at the turnkey in a facetious way, “you’re dumb as one of your own keys when you have to do with my principal, you know you are.Let us out, you old fox, or I’ll get him to bring an action against you for false imprisonment.”"
"那个监狱看守笑了笑，然后跟我们道了别，当我们走下楼梯朝大街上走去的时候，仍能看见他站在铆了钉的边门旁朝我们笑。","The turnkey laughed, and gave us good day, and stood laughing at us over the spikes of the wicket when we descended the steps into the street."
"“告诉你，皮普先生，”温米克在我耳边郑重地说道，同时抓起我的胳膊以使其显得更加机密，“我认为贾格尔斯先生做的最妙的事情就是让自己如此高高在上。他总是那样高高在上。他长期高傲的地位是与他超强的能力分不开的。那个上校不敢跟他告别，就像那个监狱看守不敢问他对那个案件有什么打算一样。于是，在他高高在上的地位与他们之间，他安插了他的下属——你明白了吗？——所以他就能完完全全地掌控他们。”","“Mind you, Mr. Pip,” said Wemmick, gravely in my ear, as he took my arm to be more confidential; “I don’t know that Mr. Jaggers does a better thing than the way in which he keeps himself so high.He’s always so high.His constant height is of a piece with his immense abilities.That Colonel durst no more take leave of him, than that turnkey durst ask him his intentions respecting a case.Then, between his height and them, he slips in his subordinate—don’t you see?—and so he has ’em, soul and body.”"
"我监护人的巧妙手段再一次给我留下了深刻的印象。说实话，我不止一次诚心诚意地希望我能有一个能力差一点的监护人。","I was very much impressed, and not for the first time, by my guardian’s subtlety.To confess the truth, I very heartily wished, and not for the first time, that I had had some other guardian of minor abilities."
"温米克先生和我在位于小不列颠街的事务所那里分开了，那些请求见贾格尔斯先生的人像往常一样在事务所附近徘徊。我继续回到驿站所在的那条大街上守着，还要等三个小时。　在这三个小时里我都在思忖一件很奇怪的事情，那就是我竟然总是被包围在监狱和犯罪的污染之中，童年时代，我就在一个冬季的晚上在我们那片荒凉的沼泽地里第一次遇上它；后来竟然又重现了两次，就像一片褪了色却没有消失的污迹+B164一样；而如今，它又以这种新的方式浸染到我的前途与发展之中。当我满脑子都想着这些事情的时候，我想起了美丽、高傲、优雅而又年轻的埃斯特拉正朝我赶来，我一想到监狱和她之间的对比就悔恨不已。我真希望温米克没有碰到过我，或者我没有听从他的话跟他走，那样的话，今年一年当中的任何一天我都不会呼吸到纽盖特监狱的空气，衣服上也不会沾染上那里的臭气。我来回地走动，想弄掉脚上沾染的监狱泥土，拍掉衣服上的尘土，大口地把肺中监狱里的空气呼出去。一想起即将到来的是谁，我就感到自己粘满了污秽，因此反而觉得马车来得太快了。就在我还没有摆脱温米克先生的温室给我带来的污秽感时，我就已经在马车窗户中看到了她的脸庞，她正在朝我招手。","Mr. Wemmick and I parted at the office in Little Britain, where suppliants for Mr. Jaggers’ notice were lingering about as usual, and I returned to my watch in the street of the coach-office, with some three hours on hand.I consumed the whole time in thinking how strange it was that I should be encompassed by all this taint of prison and crime; that, in my childhood out on our lonely marshes on a winter evening I should have first encountered it; that, it should have reappeared on two occasions, starting out like a stain that was faded but not gone; that, it should in this new way pervade my fortune and advancement.While my mind was thus engaged, I thought of the beautiful young Estella, proud and refined, coming towards me, and I thought with absolute abhorrence of the contrast between the jail and her.I wished that Wemmick had not met me, or that I had not yielded to him and gone with him, so that, of all days in the year on this day, I might not have had Newgate in my breath and on my clothes.I beat the prison dust off my feet as I sauntered to and fro, and I shook it out of my dress, and I exhaled its air from my lungs.So contaminated did I feel, remembering who was coming, that the coach came quickly after all, and I was not yet free from the soiling consciousness of Mr. Wemmick’s conservatory, when I saw her face at the coach window and her hand waving to me."
"在那一瞬间，一股无名的阴影再一次从我心头闪过，那阴影是什么呢？","What was the nameless shadow which again in that one instant had passed?"
"第三十三章","Chapter 33"
"埃斯特拉身穿毛皮旅行大衣，甚至是在我眼中，她看起来都比以往任何时候更秀雅、娇美。她的举止比她之前想要在我面前显露出来的还要更加吸引我，我想我看到了郝维仙小姐对这种变化的影响。","In her furred travelling-dress, Estella seemed more delicately beautiful than she had ever seemed yet, even in my eyes.Her manner was more winning than she had cared to let it be to me before, and I thought I saw Miss Havisham’s influence in the change."
"我们站在旅馆的院子里，她指给我看哪些是她的行李。当行李都被归整到一起时，我才想起来我还不知道她的目的地是哪里，因为除了她，我已经把所有事都忘记了。","We stood in the Inn Yard while she pointed out her luggage to me, and when it was all collected I remembered—having forgotten everything but herself in the meanwhile—that I knew nothing of her destination．"
"“我要去里士满。”她告诉我说，“我们都知道有两个里士满，一个在萨里郡，另一个在约克郡，我要去的是位于萨里的里士满。离这里有十英里远。我得雇一辆马车，然后你带我过去。这是我的钱包，你用这里面的钱付车费。噢，你必须拿上这个钱包！我们没有选择了，你和我都只能遵照指示。你和我，我们都不能由着自己的性子来。”","“I am going to Richmond,” she told me.“Our lesson is, that there are two Richmonds, one in Surrey and one in Yorkshire, and that mine is the Surrey Richmond.The distance is ten miles.I am to have a carriage, and you are to take me.This is my purse, and you are to pay my charges out of it.Oh, you must take the purse!We have no choice, you and I, but to obey our instructions.We are not free to follow our own devices, you and I.”"
"当她把钱包给我的时候，她看着我，我觉得她的这番话还有更深一层的意思。她说话时态度傲慢，但是并没有不高兴。","As she looked at me in giving me the purse, I hoped there was an inner meaning in her words.She said them slightingly, but not with displeasure."
"“必须得派人去找来马车，埃斯特拉。你想在这里休息一下吗？”","“A carriage will have to be sent for, Estella.Will you rest here a little?”"
"“好吧，我在这里休息一会儿，喝点茶，这段时间你要陪着我。”","“Yes, I am to rest here a little, and I am to drink some tea, and you are to take care of me the while.”"
"她伸出胳膊挽住我的手臂，仿佛她必须这么做似的。有一个伙计一直盯着马车看，就像他一辈子从来没有见过这种东西一样，我让这个伙计带我们到一个单独的会客室里去。听到这话，他抽出一条餐巾，它就像是一个神奇的线索，少了这个，他就不知道该怎么上楼。他把我们领进这家旅馆的一个黑洞洞的屋子里，屋里有一面缩小镜（考虑到屋子的大小，这面镜子显得非常多余）、一个鱼酱汁调味瓶和一双不知道是谁的木套鞋。由于我拒绝呆在这个地方，他把我们带进了另外一个房间，里面有一张容得下三十人用餐的餐桌，在壁炉里那一蒲式耳煤灰的下面有一页被烧焦了的习字簿纸张。这个伙计看了看已经熄灭的炉火，摇了摇头，然后来听我点餐。结果我仅是告诉他“给这位小姐沏一点茶”，他就这样垂头丧气地被我打发出了房间。","She drew her arm through mine, as if it must be done, and I requested a waiter who had been staring at the coach like a man who had never seen such a thing in his life, to show us a private sitting-room.Upon that, he pulled out a napkin, as if it were a magic clue without which he couldn’t find the way up-stairs, and led us to the black hole of the establishment: fitted up with a diminishing mirror (quite a superfluous article considering the hole’s proportions), an anchovy sauce-cruet, and somebody’s pattens.On my objecting to this retreat, he took us into another room with a dinner-table for thirty, and in the grate a scorched leaf of a copy-book under a bushel of coal-dust.Having looked at this extinct conflagration and shaken his head, he took my order: which, proving to be merely “Some tea for the lady,” sent him out of the room in a very low state of mind."
"当时我闻到这个房间里的空气散发着一股强烈的马厩和马肉汤的混合气味，即使到现在，我仍然记得那股气味。这不禁让人猜想是不是马车部的生意不好，所以有事业心的老板就把马匹宰杀烹煮了，送到小吃部出售。但是，这个房间对我来说是无价之宝，因为埃斯特拉在这房间里。我心想，只要是和她在一起，我一辈子呆在这里都会很幸福。（事实上，当时我在那里一点都不幸福，而且我也很清楚这一点。）","I was, and I am, sensible that the air of this chamber, in its strong combination of stable with soup-stock, might have led one to infer that the coaching department was not doing well, and that the enterprising proprietor was boiling down the horses for the refreshment department.Yet the room was all in all to me, Estella being in it.I thought that with her I could have been happy there for life.(I was not at all happy there at the time, observe, and I knew it well.)"
"“你要去里士满的什么地方呢？”我问埃斯特拉。","“Where are you going to, at Richmond?” I asked Estella. "
"“我要去那里，”她说，“花一大笔钱和一位夫人住在一起。这个人有能力——不，是她有能力——带我出入上流社会，让我认识上流人士，也向上流人士介绍我，让他们认识我。”","“I am going to live,” said she, “at a great expense, with a lady there, who has the power—or says she has—of taking me about, and introducing me, and showing people to me and showing me to people.”"
"“我想你会很高兴经历不同的事情、获得人们的赞赏吧？”","“I suppose you will be glad of variety and admiration?”"
"“对，我想是的。”","“Yes, I suppose so.”"
"她的回答非常漫不经心，所以我说：“你说起你自己的事情就像在说别人的事情一样。”","She answered so carelessly, that I said, “You speak of yourself as if you were some one else.”"
"“你从哪里得知我是如何谈及其他人的？　得啦，得啦，”埃斯特拉很可爱地笑着说道，“你可千万别指望我听你的教训，我必须按我自己的方式讲话。你和鄱凯特先生相处得很愉快吧？”","“Where did you learn how I speak of others?Come, come,” said Estella, smiling delightfully, “you must not expect me to go to school to you; I must talk in my own way.How do you thrive with Mr. Pocket?”"
"“我在那里过得很愉快，至少——”我觉得我似乎要错失一个机会了。","“I live quite pleasantly there; at least—”It appeared to me that I was losing a chance."
"“至少？”埃斯特拉重复道。","“At least?” repeated Estella. "
"“你不在我身边时，我在哪里觉得都一样。”","“As pleasantly as I could anywhere, away from you.”"
"“你这个傻小子，”埃斯特拉非常沉着地说道，“你怎么能这样胡说八道呢？我相信，你的朋友马修先生比他所有的家人都更受人敬重吧？”","“You silly boy,” said Estella, quite composedly, “how can you talk such nonsense?Your friend Mr. Matthew, I believe, is superior to the rest of his family?”"
"“的确更受人敬重。他不与任何人为敌——”","“Very superior indeed.He is nobody’s enemy—”"
"“还要算上他自己，”埃斯丝特拉打断了我的话，“因为我讨厌那种自寻烦恼的人。不过我听说，他真的是公正无私，不会小气妒忌，不会心怀怨恨，是这样的吗？”","“Don’t add but his own,” interposed Estella, “for I hate that class of man.But he really is disinterested, and above small jealousy and spite, I have heard?”"
"“我肯定我也很有把握这样说。”","“I am sure I have every reason to say so.”"
"“对于他的家人，你可没有把握这样说了，”埃斯特拉说着朝我点了点头，她脸上的表情既严肃又有些嘲讽的意味，“因为他们围在郝维仙小姐跟前，打你的小报告，说你的坏话。他们监视你，曲解你，写信举报你（有时候是匿名的），你就是他们生命中用来折磨和消遣的对象。你自己几乎意识不到那些人对你持有多大的敌意。”","“You have not every reason to say so of the rest of his people,” said Estella, nodding at me with an expression of face that was at once grave and rallying, “for they beset Miss Havisham with reports and insinuations to your disadvantage.They watch you, misrepresent you, write letters about you (anonymous sometimes), and you are the torment and the occupation of their lives.You can scarcely realize to yourself the hatred those people feel for you.”"
"“我觉得他们没有对我造成什么伤害吧？”","“They do me no harm, I hope?”"
"埃斯特拉没有回答，反而笑了起来。这让我感到很奇怪，我非常困惑地看着她。当她笑够了——她不是懒洋洋地笑了笑，而是真的很开心——我羞怯地对她说：","Instead of answering, Estella burst out laughing.This was very singular to me, and I looked at her in considerable perplexity.When she left off—and she had not laughed languidly, but with real enjoyment—I said, in my diffident way with her:"
"“我希望我可以这样认为，如果他们伤害了我，你不会幸灾乐祸。”","“I hope I may suppose that you would not be amused if they did me any harm.”"
"“不会的，不会的，这一点你可以放心。”埃斯特拉说，“你可以肯定的是，我之所以笑是因为他们失败了。噢，那些围着郝维仙小姐的人啊，他们自作自受！”她又开始笑，即使现在她把原因告诉我了，我还是觉得她的笑很奇怪，我不怀疑她的笑是发自内心的，但似乎对于这个场合来说笑得太过分了。我想肯定还有什么事情我不知道，她看出了我的心思，于是回答了我的疑问。","“No, no you may be sure of that,” said Estella.“You may be certain that I laugh because they fail.Oh, those people with Miss Havisham, and the tortures they undergo!”She laughed again, and even now when she had told me why, her laughter was very singular to me, for I could not doubt its being genuine, and yet it seemed too much for the occasion.I thought there must really be something more here than I knew; she saw the thought in my mind, and answered it."
"“即使对你而言也很难。”埃斯特拉说道，“很难了解当我看到那些人受挫的时候我有多高兴，当他们出丑的时候我有多开心。因为你不是那个从婴儿时起就在那所奇怪的房子里被带大的人——而我是。你并没有在看似是同情怜悯，实际上却不是温柔慰藉的面具之下，被压迫着，毫无反抗之力——而我经历过这些。你并没有逐渐睁大你那圆圆的、稚嫩的眼睛，发现那个女骗子的真面目，那个女骗子只有在深夜醒来的时候才敢细数一下自己内心还留有多少宁静。——而我却经历过这些。”","“It is not easy for even you.” said Estella, “to know what satisfaction it gives me to see those people thwarted, or what an enjoyable sense of the ridiculous I have when they are made ridiculous.For you were not brought up in that strange house from a mere baby.—I was.You had not your little wits sharpened by their intriguing against you, suppressed and defenseless, under the mask of sympathy and pity and what not that is soft and soothing.—I had.You did not gradually open your round childish eyes wider and wider to the discovery of that impostor of a woman who calculates her stores of peace of mind for when she wakes up in the night.—I did.”"
"此时，对埃斯特拉来说，这些并不好笑了，而且她是从内心深处唤起这些往事的。尽管我得到了一大笔遗产，但我并不是造成她现在这副表情的原因。","It was no laughing matter with Estella now, nor was she summoning these remembrances from any shallow place.I would not have been the cause of that look of hers, for all my expectations in a heap."
"“我可以告诉你两件事，”埃斯特拉说，“首先，尽管俗话说水滴石穿，但你尽管放心，这些人不管是在大事还是小事上，永远无法——一百年都无法——损害你和郝维仙小姐之间的关系。第二，我感谢你，正是因为你，他们才如此地奔波忙碌，不怀好意，到头来却是徒劳一场，为此我要与你握手致敬。”","“Two things I can tell you,” said Estella.“First, notwithstanding the proverb that constant dropping will wear away a stone, you may set your mind at rest that these people never will—never would, in hundred years—impair your ground with Miss Havisham, in any particular, great or small.Second, I am beholden to you as the cause of their being so busy and so mean in vain, and there is my hand upon it.”"
"当她顽皮地把手向我伸过来时——因为她低落的情绪转瞬即逝——我握着她的手，送到唇边，亲吻了一下。“你这个可恶的小子，”埃斯特拉说道，“你永远都不听警告吧？还是你现在吻我的手跟之前我让你吻我脸颊时是一个意思？”","As she gave it me playfully—for her darker mood had been but momentary—I held it and put it to my lips.“You ridiculous boy,” said Estella, “will you never take warning?Or do you kiss my hand in the same spirit in which I once let you kiss my cheek?”"
"“那次是什么意思？”我说。","“What spirit was that?” said I. "
"“我必须得想一下，那次是一种对马屁精和密谋者的藐视。”","“I must think a moment A spirit of contempt for the fawners and plotters.”"
"“如果我说‘是的’，那我可以再吻一下脸颊吗？”","“If I say yes, may I kiss the cheek again?”"
"“你应该在吻我的手之前问这个问题的。不过，如果你高兴的话，可以。”","“You should have asked before you touched the hand.But, yes, if you like.”"
"我俯下身去，她面容平静，就像一尊雕像。“好了，”我的嘴唇刚一碰到埃斯特拉的脸颊，她就躲闪开了，同时说道，“现在你要保证我能喝上点茶，然后你要把我送到里士满。”","I leaned down, and her calm face was like a statue’s.“Now,” said Estella, gliding away the instant I touched her cheek, “you are to take care that I have some tea, and you are to take me to Richmond.”"
"她又恢复到这种语气，仿佛我们之间的交往都是被强迫的，而我们俩也仅仅是傀儡一样。这让我很痛苦，不过我们之间往来的所有事情都让我很痛苦。不管她对我的语气是怎样的，我都无法信以为真，也无法抱有希望，然而尽管没有信任，没有希望，我仍然继续下去。为什么要一千次地重复呢？事情一直都是如此。","Her reverting to this tone as if our association were forced upon us and we were mere puppets, gave me pain; but everything in our intercourse did give me pain.Whatever her tone with me happened to be, I could put no trust in it, and build no hope on it; and yet I went on against trust and against hope.Why repeat it a thousand times?So it always was."
"我打铃招呼上茶，于是那个带着那条神奇线索一样餐巾的伙计又出现了，他来来回回送来大约五十件饮茶的附属品，但却没看到茶的踪影。这些附属品包括一个茶盘、茶杯、茶托、碟子、刀叉（包括切肉用的刀叉）、各式各样的调羹、盐瓶、一个嵌在坚硬的铁盖之下，因此被保护得好好的、松软的小松饼。一点点松软的黄油躺在一大团荷兰芹上，很像躺在芦苇中的摩西，一条顶部洒满粉状材料的白面包，两个带有厨房火炉铁烙印记的三角形面包，最后是一把圆鼓鼓的家用茶壶：那个伙计拿着这些东西踉踉跄跄地进来了，脸上一副不堪重负、受苦受难的样子。送来这些东西之后，他离开了很长一段时间，最后终于拿着一个外表看起来很珍贵的盒子回来了，盒子里面装着像小树枝一样的茶叶。我把茶叶泡在热水里，然后用尽所有的器具，提取出一杯我也不知道是什么茶，递给了埃斯特拉。","I rang for the tea, and the waiter, reappearing with his magic clue, brought in by degrees some fifty adjuncts to that refreshment but of tea not a glimpse.A teaboard, cups and saucers, plates, knives and forks (including carvers), spoons (various), saltcellars, a meek little muffin confined with the utmost precaution under a strong iron cover, Moses in the bullrushes typified by a soft bit of butter in a quantity of parsley, a pale loaf with a powdered head, two proof impressions of the bars of the kitchen fire-place on triangular bits of bread, and ultimately a fat family urn: which the waiter staggered in with, expressing in his countenance burden and suffering.After a prolonged absence at this stage of the entertainment, he at length came back with a casket of precious appearance containing twigs.These I steeped in hot water, and so from the whole of these appliances extracted one cup of I don’t know what, for Estella."
"最后我们付了账，对那个伙计、马夫，还有女仆一一打赏——总之，旅馆上上下下都得到了小费，以致于他们反倒向我们投来鄙视和怨恨的目光。埃斯特拉的钱包变得轻多了——之后我们就坐上马车离开了。马车拐进了齐普塞德，叮叮当当地在纽盖特大街上行驶，不一会儿我们就来到了那让我感到羞耻的高墙之下。","The bill paid, and the waiter remembered, and the ostler not forgotten, and the chambermaid taken into consideration—in a word, the whole house bribed into a state of contempt and animosity, and Estella’s purse much lightened—we got into our post-coach and drove away.Turning into Cheapside and rattling up Newgate-street, we were soon under the walls of which I was so ashamed."
"“这是什么地方？”埃斯特拉问我。","“What place is that?” Estella asked me. "
"我先是假装无知，装成一开始没认出来，然后才告诉了她。她探出头去看了看，然后又把头缩回来，小声说道：“一群坏蛋！”无论如何，我都不会坦白告诉她说我来过这里。","I made a foolish pretence of not at first recognizing it, and then told her.As she looked at it, and drew in her head again, murmuring “Wretches!”I would not have confessed to my visit for any consideration."
"“贾格尔斯先生，”我利索地把话题转到了其他人的身上，说道，“他比伦敦任何人都更加熟知这个鬼地方的秘密，因此他很有名气。”","“Mr. Jaggers,” said I, by way of putting it neatly on somebody else, “has the reputation of being more in the secrets of that dismal place than any man in London.”"
"“我想，他对所有地方的秘密都掌握得比别人多。”埃斯特拉低声说道。","“He is more in the secrets of every place, I think,” said Estella, in a low voice."
"“我猜，你已经习惯经常见到他了吧？”","“You have been accustomed to see him often, I suppose?”"
"“从我记事时起，我就习惯了不时见到他。但是我现在就和我刚刚学会说话那时一样不了解他。你自己和他来往得怎么样？你和他相处得好吗？”","“I have been accustomed to see him at uncertain intervals, ever since I can remember.But I know him no better now, than I did before I could speak plainly.What is your own experience of him?Do you advance with him?”"
"“一旦习惯了他那种疑神疑鬼的行为举止之后，”我说道，“我就跟他相处得挺好的了。”","“Once habituated to his distrustful manner,” said I, “I have done very well.”"
"“你们俩关系很亲近吗？”","“Are you intimate?”"
"“我曾在他的私人住宅里和他吃过饭。”","“I have dined with him at his private house.”"
"“我猜想，”埃斯特拉停顿了一下又接着说道，“那一定是个古怪的地方。”","“I fancy,” said Estella, shrinking “that must be a curious place.”"
"“是个古怪的地方。”","“It is a curious place.”"
"我本应该谨慎地谈论我的监护人，即使是和她谈也不能太随意，但是要不是当时我们突然被煤气灯刺眼的光亮照得睁不开眼的话，我一定会继续那个话题，仔细描述一下那次在杰勒德街吃饭的情形。在这光亮持续的那段时间里，仿佛我之前那种不可名状的感觉又被照亮、被唤醒了。我们驶出这片光亮之后，有那么一小会儿，我仍然是恍恍惚惚的，仿佛我刚刚是置身于闪电中一样。","I should have been chary of discussing my guardian too freely even with her; but I should have gone on with the subject so far as to describe the dinner in Gerrard-street, if we had not then come into a sudden glare of gas.It seemed, while it lasted, to be all alight and alive with that inexplicable feeling I had had before; and when we were out of it, I was as much dazed for a few moments as if I had been in Lightning."
"于是我们又谈起了其他的话题，主要是关于我们马车正在驶过的这条路，谈谈路的这边是伦敦的哪些地方，路的那边又是伦敦的哪些地方。她告诉我说，对她而言，这个大城市几乎是完全陌生的，因为在她去法国之前她从来没有离开过郝维仙小姐居住的那片地区，而那时候往返法国时她也仅仅是经过伦敦而已。我问她，呆在这里的这段时间，我的监护人是否也监管着她。听了我的话，她斩钉截铁地说道：“但愿上帝不要让他来监管我！”然后没有再说别的了。","So, we fell into other talk, and it was principally about the way by which we were travelling, and about what parts of London lay on this side of it, and what on that.The great city was almost new to her, she told me, for she had never left Miss Havisham’s neighborhood until she had gone to France, and she had merely passed through London then in going and returning.I asked her if my guardian had any charge of her while she remained here?To that she emphatically said “God forbid!” and no more."
"我不可避免地发现她想要吸引我的注意，她成功地做到了。不过这项任务本来就不难，即使困难，她也早已经俘获了我的心了。然而这并没有让我更加开心，因为即使她不是出于别人精心安排我们俩在一起才这样做的，我也已经感觉到她之所以把我的心捧在手里是因为她故意选择这样做，而不是因为碾碎这颗心、抛弃这颗心会博得她任何一丝的柔情。","It was impossible for me to avoid seeing that she cared to attract me; that she made herself winning; and would have won me even if the task had needed pains.Yet this made me none the happier, for, even if she had not taken that tone of our being disposed of by others, I should have felt that she held my heart in her hand because she willfully chose to do it, and not because it would have wrung any tenderness in her, to crush it and throw it away."
"当我们经过哈默史密斯时，我指给她看马修·鄱凯特先生的住处。我跟她说这里离里士满不远，我希望我能不时地去看看她。","When we passed through Hammersmith, I showed her where Mr. Matthew Pocket lived, and said it was no great way from Richmond, and that I hoped I should see her sometimes."
"“哦，当然了，你要来看我，只要你觉得时间合适，就来看看我，我会跟那家人说起你的，实际上，我已经跟他们说起过你了。”","“Oh yes, you are to see me; you are to come when you think proper; you are to be mentioned to the family; indeed you are already mentioned.”"
"我问她，马上要接纳她的这个家庭是不是个人口很多的大家庭。","I inquired was it a large household she was going to be a member of?"
"“不是，只有两个人，一位母亲和她的女儿。那位母亲是一位有一定社会地位的贵妇人，不过这并不影响她增加她的收入。”","“No; there are only two; mother and daughter.The mother is a lady of some station, though not averse to increasing her income.”"
"“我想郝维仙小姐一定无法忍受这么快又和你分开了。”","“I wonder Miss Havisham could part with you again so soon.”"
"“这是郝维仙小姐为我做的众多安排之一，皮普，”埃斯特拉说着叹了口气，仿佛她已经疲倦了似的，“我将要时常给她写信，定期回去看她，向她报告我的情况——不仅是我，还有那些珠宝——因为现在它们几乎都是我的了。”","“It is a part of Miss Havisham’s plans for me, Pip,” said Estella, with a sigh, as if she were tired; “I am to write to her constantly and see her regularly and report how I go on—I and the jewels—for they are nearly all mine now.”"
"这是她第一次叫我的名字。当然，她是有意这样做的，她知道我对此会非常珍视的。","It was the first time she had ever called me by my name.Of course she did so, purposely, and knew that I should treasure it up."
"我们很快就来到里士满，到达了我们的目的地，那是一幢位于绿地旁边的房屋，呆板而又古老。以前这里曾经是宫廷所在地，每逢朝觐之日，这里便聚集了身着盛装、面施粉黛、衣缀挂饰的宫女和身穿锦绣大衣、腿上卷起长袜、袖口装饰着花边、手中紧握利剑的勇士们。房前的几株古树仍然被修整得整整齐齐，就像那些缀着圆环的盛装、带着波纹的假发以及僵硬的衣摆一样刻板、一样不自然。不过它们离自己在亡魂队伍中所分配到的席位已经不远了，它们不久就会加入到那个队伍，从此归于沉寂。","We came to Richmond all too soon, and our destination there, was a house by the Green; a staid old house, where hoops and powder and patches, embroidered coats rolled stockings ruffles and swords, had had their court days many a time.Some ancient trees before the house were still cut into fashions as formal and unnatural as the hoops and wigs and stiff skirts; but their own allotted places in the great procession of the dead were not far off, and they would soon drop into them and go the silent way of the rest."
"门铃发出一种苍老的响声——我敢说，当时这个门铃经常向房屋通报：身着绿色盛装的王妃驾到；手持镶嵌钻石宝剑的骑士驾到；脚蹬一双有红鞋跟、镶着蓝宝石的鞋子的夫人驾到——这响声在月光下听起来很庄重，随后两个身穿樱桃色衣服的侍女匆忙出来迎接埃斯特拉。很快，她的行李箱都被搬进了门，她向我伸出手来，笑了笑，说了声晚安，然后也进门去了。而我仍然站在那里，看着那幢房子，心想如果我能和她一起住在那里，我会有多幸福啊，同时我也明白，和她在一起我永远都不会幸福，我永远都只有痛苦。","A bell with an old voice—which I dare say in its time had often said to the house, Here is the green farthingale, Here is the diamondhilted sword, Here are the shoes with red heels and the blue solitaire,—sounded gravely in the moonlight, and two cherrycolored maids came fluttering out to receive Estella.The doorway soon absorbed her boxes, and she gave me her hand and a smile, and said good night, and was absorbed likewise.And still I stood looking at the house, thinking how happy I should be if I lived there with her, and knowing that I never was happy with her, but always miserable."
"我坐上了那辆要把我带回到哈默史密斯的马车，上车时，我的心很痛，而等到下车时，我的心却更痛了。在我们家门口，我看到了刚刚参加完一个小型舞会的小简·鄱凯特，她由她的小情人护送着回到家，我很羡慕她的小情人，尽管他还要受到弗洛普森的管束。","I got into the carriage to be taken back to Hammersmith, and I got in with a bad heart-ache, and I got out with a worse heart-ache.At our own door, I found little Jane Pocket coming home from a little party escorted by her little lover; and I envied her little lover, in spite of his being subject to Flopson."
"鄱凯特先生外出讲学去了，因为他是一个在家庭理财方面非常优秀的讲师。他所写的关于孩童和仆人管理的著作被认为是和这些主题相关的、最优秀的教科书。不过，鄱凯特太太在家，她遇到了一点麻烦，因为米勒斯不辞而别（她有个亲戚在步兵团），所以为了让宝宝安静下来，她拿来一个针盒子给宝宝把玩。结果很多针都不见了，丢失的那些针对一个这样年龄的病人来说，不管是外用还是当成补药一样吞下去，都是绰绰有余的。","Mr. Pocket was out lecturing; for, he was a most delightful lecturer on domestic economy, and his treatises on the management of children and servants were considered the very best text-books on those themes.But, Mrs. Pocket was at home, and was in a little difficulty, on account of the baby’s having been accommodated with a needle-case to keep him quiet during the unaccountable absence (with a relative in the Foot Guards) of Millers.And more needles were missing, than it could be regarded as quite wholesome for a patient of such tender years either to apply externally or to take as a tonic."
"鄱凯特先生因为他能给出非常优秀、实际的建议，能提出清晰合理的观点，并拥有非常明智的头脑而十分出名，而这名声并非言过其实。现在在我心痛之时，我想向他倾诉我的心事。但是我抬起头正好看到鄱凯特太太坐在那里读她的贵族谱，她已经把宝宝放到了床上，断定床才是解决问题的最好办法。我心想——好吧——算了，我不说了。","Mr. Pocket being justly celebrated for giving most excellent practical advice, and for having a clear and sound perception of things and a highly judicious mind, I had some notion in my heartache of begging him to accept my confidence.But, happening to look up at Mrs. Pocket as she sat reading her book of dignities after prescribing Bed as a sovereign remedy for baby, I thought—Well—No, I wouldn’t."
"第三十四章","Chapter 34"
"随着我逐渐适应我所继承的大笔遗产，我也不知不觉地开始注意到这大笔遗产对我，以及对我周围人的影响。它们对我自身性格产生了影响，虽然我尽可能地假装没有意识到，但我非常清楚，这种影响并非都是有益的。我对乔的所作所为让我长期处于一种不安的状态。一想到比迪，我的良心就根本无法安宁下来。有时当我在深夜里醒来——就像卡米拉那样——感到精神疲惫，我常常想，如果我从来没有和郝维仙小姐见过面，也许我会过得更好，更幸福，也许我早已长大成人，心满意足地呆在那个实在的老铁匠铺里，成为乔的合伙人。有多少个晚上，当我独自坐在那里看着炉火，心里就在想，毕竟这世间再也没有像铁匠铺里那样的炉火了，也再也没有像家中那样的灶火了。","As I had grown accustomed to my expectations, I had insensibly begun to notice their effect upon myself and those around me.Their influence on my own character, I disguised from my recognition as much as possible, but I knew very well that it was not all good.I lived in a state of chronic uneasiness respecting my behavior to Joe.My conscience was not by any means comfortable about Biddy.When I woke up in the night—like Camilla—I used to think, with a weariness on my spirits, that I should have been happier and better if I had never seen Miss Havisham’s face, and had risen to manhood content to be partners with Joe in the honest old forge.Many a time of an evening, when I sat alone looking at the fire, I thought, after all, there was no fire like the forge fire and the kitchen fire at home."
"但是，我所有的焦躁不安、心烦意乱都与埃斯特拉分不开，因此我真的陷入到了困惑当中：这些不安与烦恼有多少其实都是我自己造成的啊。也就是说，假设我没有继承遗产，但仍然满心想着埃斯特拉，我还是无法满意地对自己说我会比现在好到哪里去。另外，我也不会满意我的地位给他人带来的影响。我感知到——尽管非常模糊，但也许那就足够了——我的地位对任何人都是无益的，尤其是对赫伯特来说，毫无益处。我花钱大手大脚的习惯影响了他随和的性格，让他花费他负担不起的钱，腐蚀了他单纯、朴素的生活，让焦躁与悔恨扰乱了他内心的平静。我无意识中让鄱凯特家族的其他亲属们使出那些蹩脚的手段，对此我一点都不感到自责，因为小气本来就是他们的天性，即使这种天性没有被我唤醒，也会被其他任何一个人激发。但是赫伯特的情况非常不一样，每当我想到自己曾经给他带来的坏影响，心里就非常愧疚，我在他几乎没有家具的房间里塞满了不搭调的软垫家具，还安排了一个穿金色背心的复仇鬼供他差遣。","Yet Estella was so inseparable from all my restlessness and disquiet of mind, that I really fell into confusion as to the limits of my own part in its production.That is to say, supposing I had had no expectations, and yet had had Estella to think of, I could not make out to my satisfaction that I should have done much better.Now, concerning the influence of my position on others, I was in no such difficulty, and so I perceived—though dimly enough perhaps—that it was not beneficial to anybody, and, above all, that it was not beneficial to Herbert.My lavish habits led his easy nature into expenses that he could not afford, corrupted the simplicity of his life, and disturbed his peace with anxieties and regrets.I was not at all remorseful for having unwittingly set those other branches of the Pocket family to the poor arts they practiced: because such littlenesses were their natural bent, and would have been evoked by anybody else, if I had left them slumbering.But Herbert’s was a very different case, and it often caused me a twinge to think that I had done him evil service in crowding his sparely-furnished chambers with incongruous upholstery work, and placing the canary-breasted Avenger at his disposal."
"所以，随着享受小安逸不可避免地变成贪图大乐，我如今开始背负大量的债务。我一开始干什么，他也必然会效仿，所以他很快也债务缠身。遵循斯塔特普的建议，我们两个经过推选加入了一个名为“林中鸟”的俱乐部。我从来没有猜出这个团体设立的宗旨是什么，成员们所做的无非是每两个星期聚在一起奢侈地大吃一顿，饭后使出浑身解数来争论不休，还让六个侍者醉倒在楼梯上。我知道这些聚会永远都要达到这种程度才算是令人满意，才算是圆满结束，但我和赫伯特除了聚会一开始提到的那句祝酒词之外，别的一无所知。那句祝酒词是这样说的：“先生们，愿‘林中鸟’俱乐部的成员之间永远保有像现在这样的美好情谊。”","So now, as an infallible way of making little ease great ease, I began to contract a quantity of debt.I could hardly begin but Herbert must begin too, so he soon followed.At Startop’s suggestion, we put ourselves down for election into a club called The Finches of the Grove: the object of which institution I have never divined, if it were not that the members should dine expensively once a fortnight, to quarrel among themselves as much as possible after dinner, and to cause six waiters to get drunk on the stairs.I Know that these gratifying social ends were so invariably accomplished, that Herbert and I understood nothing else to be referred to in the first standing toast of the society: which ran “Gentlemen, may the present promotion of good feeling ever reign predominant among the Finches of the Grove.”"
"林中鸟会员们花起钱来简直是荒唐（我们聚餐所在的饭店是科芬园饭店），我有幸加入林中鸟俱乐部之后见到的第一位会员竟是本特利·德鲁莫尔。当时他正驾驶着自己的马车在镇上乱窜，给街角的不少灯柱子带来了很大的破坏。有时候，他会从车箱帘子后面一头栽下来。我有一次就看见他在“林中鸟”俱乐部门口以这种偶然的方式从马车上滚落下来——就像煤块一样。但是在这里我没有太大的期望，因为我不是一个会员，根据这个团体的神圣章程，我必须到成年才能成为一名会员。","The Finches spent their money foolishly (the Hotel we dined at was in Covent-garden), and the first Finch I saw, when I had the honor of joining the Grove, was Bentley Drummle: at that time floundering about town in a cab of his own, and doing a great deal of damage to the posts at the street corners.Occasionally, he shot himself out of his equipage head-foremost over the apron; and I saw him on one occasion deliver himself at the door of the Grove in this unintentional way—like coals.But here I anticipate a little for I was not a Finch, and could not be, according to the sacred laws of the society, until I came of age."
"我对自己的财力很有信心，所以我愿意承担赫伯特的花费，但是赫伯特自尊心很强，我无法向他提出这样的建议。于是，他处处犯难，然后继续四处寻找解决办法。当我们逐渐养成了相伴熬夜的习惯时，我注意到早餐时他用沮丧的眼神观望四周；将近中午时，他看起来有了些希望；吃晚饭的时候他又低落了；晚饭之后，他似乎是清清楚楚地看到了远方的财富；接近午夜时分，他似乎马上就能得到那笔财富了；大约凌晨两点的时候，他又再度陷入深深的沮丧之中，口口声声说要买上一把来复枪到美洲去，靠训猎水牛来发财。","In my confidence in my own resources, I would willingly have taken Herbert’s expenses on myself; but Herbert was proud, and I could make no such proposal to him.So, he got into difficulties in every direction, and continued to look about him.When we gradually fell into keeping late hours and late company, I noticed that he looked about him with a desponding eye at breakfast-time; that he began to look about him more hopefully about mid-day; that he drooped when he came into dinner; that he seemed to descry Capital in the distance rather clearly, after dinner; that he all but realized Capital towards midnight; and that at about two o’clock in the morning, he became so deeply despondent again as to talk of buying a rifle and going to America, with a general purpose of compelling buffaloes to make his fortune."
"一般我每个星期有一半的时间都呆在哈默史密斯，当我在那里的时候，我就去里士满看望埃斯特拉，这件事以后再细说。我在哈默史密斯的时候，赫伯特就会经常来找我。我想每逢这种时候，他父亲脑中就会偶尔有个一闪而过的念头，那就是他一直在寻找的机遇还没有到来。但是，整个家族都是在摸爬滚打，力图过上好日子，而赫伯特跌落出了这种生活轨迹，在某种程度上这本身也是应对生活的一种方式。与此同时，鄱凯特先生的灰白头发更多了，他也更频繁地在自己困惑、茫然的时候抓起头发，想以此让自己变清醒。而鄱凯特太太则随处放置她的脚凳，害得家人常常绊倒，她还在读那本贵族谱，她还总是弄丢她的手帕，跟我们讲她祖父的故事，讲如何看管小孩子，她的方法就是只要小孩子引起她的注意，她就把他扔到床上。","I was usually at Hammersmith about half the week, and when I was at Hammersmith I haunted Richmond: whereof separately by-and-by.Herbert would often come to Hammersmith when I was there, and I think at those seasons his father would occasionally have some passing perception that the opening he was looking for, had not appeared yet.But in the general tumbling up of the family, his tumbling out in life somewhere, was a thing to transact itself somehow.In the meantime Mr. Pocket grew greyer, and tried oftener to lift himself out of his perplexities by the hair.While Mrs. Pocket tripped up the family with her footstool, read her book of dignities, lost her pocket-handkerchief, told us about her grandpapa, and taught the young idea how to shoot, by shooting it into bed whenever it attracted her notice."
"由于我现在要概括一下我生命中的这个时期，以此来为我之后的叙述扫清障碍，所以我觉得最好的办法就是马上完整地描述一下我们在巴纳德旅馆通常的行为举止和习惯。","As I am now generalizing a period of my life with the object of clearing my way before me, I can scarcely do so better than by at once completing the description of our usual manners and customs at Barnard’s Inn."
"我们尽情地花钱，换来的却很少，因为人们总是随心所欲地想给我们多少就给我们多少。我们总是或多或少地有些痛苦，而且我们大部分的熟人都身处同样的处境。我们都有一个欢快的臆想，那就是我们一直都很快乐，而骨子里的那个事实是我们从来都不快乐。我坚信，我们这样的事例是非常普遍的。","We spent as much money as we could, and got as little for it as people could make up their minds to give us.We were always more or less miserable, and most of our acquaintance were in the same condition.There was a gay fiction among us that we were constantly enjoying ourselves, and a skeleton truth that we never did.To the best of my belief, our case was in the last aspect a rather common one."
"每天早晨，带着焕然一新的感觉，赫伯特都会去伦敦金融城寻找机会。我经常到那个黑暗的后房当中看看他，在那个屋子里陪伴着他的是一瓶墨水、一个挂帽钉、一个煤匣子、一个线筐子、一本年历、一张桌子、一个板凳、还有一把尺子。除了四处观望寻找机会之外，我不记得我还看见他做过什么其他的事情。如果我们都能像赫伯特那样忠实地做好我们承诺要做的事情，也许我们就能生活在一个道德高尚的美好国度了。那个可怜的老兄无事可做，除了每天下午在固定的时间到罗意德商船协会去——我想，只是例行公事地去看一看他的上司。我从没发现他做过任何跟罗意德商船协会有关的事情，仅仅是去了又回。当他感到自己的情况异常严峻，感到自己必须找到一个机会的时候，他就会在证券交易所最繁忙的时候到那里去，然后在一堆的商业巨头当中走来走去，就像一个忧郁的乡村舞者一样。“那是因为，”有一次当赫伯特从交易所那个特别的场合回家吃饭时对我说，“我发现事实是，汉德尔，机会不会来找我们，我们必须去找它——所以我就一直在寻找机会。”","Every morning, with an air ever new, Herbert went into the City to look about him.I often paid him a visit in the dark back-room in which he consorted with an ink-jar, a hat-peg, a coal-box, a string-box, an almanack, a desk and stool, and a ruler; and I do not remember that I ever saw him do anything else but look about him.If we all did what we undertake to do, as faithfully as Herbert did, we might live in a Republic of the Virtues.He had nothing else to do, poor fellow, except at a certain hour of every afternoon to “go to Lloyd’s”—in observance of a ceremony of seeing his principal, I think.He never did anything else in connexion with Lloyd’s that I could find out, except come back again.When he felt his case unusually serious, and that he positively must find an opening, he would go on ’Change at a busy time, and walk in and out, in a kind of gloomy country dance figure, among the assembled magnates.“For,” says Herbert to me, coming home to dinner on one of those special occasions, “I find the truth to be, Handel, that an opening won’t come to one, but one must go to it—so I have been.”"
"如果我们不是像现在这样关系亲密的话，我想我们肯定每天早上都要定期地咒骂彼此。在那段让我悔恨的时期里，我极度厌恶那些房间，无法忍受看见复仇鬼穿着那件特殊制服。在早上，这件制服看起来比在一天当中的其他任何时候都要更昂贵，却更物非所值。随着我们负债越来越多，早餐的供应也就越来越少了。有一天在吃早餐的时候，我们收到一封信，信中威胁说不还债就起诉我们，口气就像我们当地的报纸可能会这样描述一样：“这与珠宝盗窃案并不是毫无关系。”这时复仇鬼自作主张地认为我们想要吃面包圈，我忍无可忍，一把抓住了他的蓝衣领，让他两脚离地，然后拼命地摇晃他——事实上他已经在半空中了，就像一个穿着靴子的丘比特一样。","If we had been less attached to one another, I think we must have hated one another regularly every morning.I detested the chambers beyond expression at that period of repentance, and could not endure the sight of the Avenger’s livery: which had a more expensive and a less remunerative appearance then, than at any other time in the four-and-twenty hours.As we got more and more into debt breakfast became a hollower and hollower form, and, being on one occasion at breakfast-time threatened (by letter) with legal proceedings, “not unwholly unconnected,” as my local paper might put it, “with jewellery,” I went so far as to seize the Avenger by his blue collar and shake him off his feet—so that he was actually in the air, like a booted Cupid—for presuming to suppose that we wanted a roll."
"每到一定的时间——其实时间不定，因为这要看我们的兴致——我就会像有一个重大发现一样对赫伯特说：","At certain times—meaning at uncertain times, for they depended on our humor—I would say to Herbert, as if it were a remarkable discovery:"
"“我亲爱的赫伯特，我们的情况越来越糟糕了。”","“My dear Herbert, we are getting on badly.”"
"“我亲爱的汉德尔，”赫伯特会非常真诚地对我说：“你要相信我，不知道为什么会这么巧，你的话也是我想要说的话。”","“My dear Handel,” Herbert would say to me, in all sincerity, “if you will believe me, those very words were on my lips, by a strange coincidence.”"
"“那么，赫伯特，”我会回答说，“让我们想想怎么样处理这些事情吧。”","“Then, Herbert,” I would respond, “let us look into out affairs.”"
"我们总是极其满意我们两人能约定来解决这个问题。我一直认为这就是正事，这就是应对问题的方式，这就是扼住敌人咽喉的方法。而且我知道赫伯特也是这么想的。","We always derived profound satisfaction from making an appointment for this purpose.I always thought this was business, this was the way to confront the thing, this was the way to take the foe by the throat.And I know Herbert thought so too."
"晚餐时我们点了一些与往常很不一样的好菜，配上一瓶同样不同寻常的好酒，以此来振奋我们的精神，来+B74纪念这一时刻，也好让我们达到标准，完成任务。晚饭过后，我们拿来许多笔，充足的墨水，还有大量的写字纸和吸墨纸。因为大量的文具会让人感到非常舒服自在。","We ordered something rather special for dinner, with a bottle of something similarly out of the common way, in order that our minds might be fortified for the occasion, and we might come well up to the mark.Dinner over, we produced a bundle of pens, a copious supply of ink, and a goodly show of writing and blotting paper.For, there was something very comfortable in having plenty of stationery."
"然后我会拿出一张纸，在纸的上端整整齐齐地写下标题《皮普债务备忘录》，接着仔细地加上巴纳德旅馆和日期。赫伯特也会拿来一张纸，用同样的形式写下《赫伯特债务备忘录》。","I would then take a sheet of paper, and write across the top of it, in a neat hand, the heading, “Memorandum of Pip’s debts;” with Barnard’s Inn and the date very carefully added.Herbert would also take a sheet of paper, and write across it with similar formalities, “Memorandum of Herbert’s debts.”"
"然后我们每个人都开始查看他身边的那堆杂乱的纸张，这些纸张之前有的被扔在抽屉里，有的放在口袋里被磨出了洞，有的用来点蜡烛时已烧去了一半，有的被塞在镜子后面好几个星期了，不然早就破烂不堪了。我们的笔在沙沙作响，这让我们精神极其振奋，甚至让我有时候觉得很难把这种很有启迪性的事务与真正的还钱区分开来。从自身所具备的价值来看，这两者似乎是不相上下。","Each of us would then refer to a confused heap of papers at his side, which had been thrown into drawers, worn into holes in Pockets, half-burnt in lighting candles, stuck for weeks into the looking-glass, and otherwise damaged.The sound of our pens going, refreshed us exceedingly, insomuch that I sometimes found it difficult to distinguish between this edifying business proceeding and actually paying the money.In point of meritorious character, the two things seemed about equal."
"当我们写了一小会儿之后，我会问问赫伯特他的进展如何。赫伯特很可能在看着他那不断上升的数字，一直极其惆怅、+B86悔恨地挠头。","When we had written a little while, I would ask Herbert how he got on?Herbert probably would have been scratching his head in a most rueful manner at the sight of his accumulating figures."
"“数字越来越大，汉德尔，”赫伯特会说，“我发誓，数字越来越大。”","“They are mounting up, Handel,” Herbert would say; “upon my life, they are mounting up.”"
"“坚定一点，赫伯特，”我总是一边孜孜不倦地奋笔疾书，一边反驳他说，“勇敢地去面对。理清你的所有事情。盯着它们，用你的目光来使它们感到畏惧。”","“Be firm, Herbert,” I would retort, plying my own pen with great assiduity.“Look the thing in the face.Look into your affairs.Stare them out of countenance.”"
"“我会的，汉德尔，只是它们正在盯着我，让我感到畏惧。”","“So I would, Handel, only they are staring me out of countenance.”"
"不管怎样，我坚定的神态会起作用，赫伯特会继续写下去。一会儿过后，他又会再次放弃，借口说他还没有拿到科布斯的账单，或者是罗布斯的，再或者是诺布斯的，视情况而定。","However, my determined manner would have its effect, and Herbert would fall to work again.After a time he would give up once more, on the plea that he had not got Cobbs’ bill, or Lobbs’, or Nobbs’, as the case might be."
"“那么，赫伯特，估算一下吧，估计出个大概的数字，然后把它记下来。”","“Then, Herbert, estimate; estimate it in round numbers, and put it down.”"
"“你真是个聪明的家伙！”我的这位朋友会赞赏地回答道，“真的，你办事的能力真强。”","“What a fellow of resource you are!” my friend would reply with admiration.“Really your business powers are very remarkable.”"
"我也这么认为。在这些场合中，我为自己赢得了办事一流的美名——迅速、果断、积极主动、条理清晰、头脑冷静。当我把自己背负的所有债务写下来列成清单之后，我把每一笔欠款与账单仔细核对，一一打勾做记号。当我在账目上打勾的时候，那种自我肯定是一种非常舒服的感觉。当所有的勾都打完了之后，我把我全部的账单都叠成一样大小，在每一张后面都附上标签，然后把它们扎成整齐的一捆。然后我帮赫伯特做了同样的整理（他谦虚地说自己没有我那种管理才能），我感觉自己已经帮他把事情理出了头绪。","I thought so too.I established with myself on these occasions, the reputation of a first-rate man of business—prompt, decisive, energetic, clear, cool-headed.When I had got all my responsibilities down upon my list, I compared each with the bill, and ticked it off.My self-approval when I ticked an entry was quite a luxurious sensation.When I had no more ticks to make, I folded all my bills up uniformly, docketed each on the back, and tied the whole into a symmetrical bundle.Then I did the same for Herbert (who modestly said he had not my administrative genius), and felt that I had brought his affairs into a focus for him."
"我的处事习惯还有另一个优点，我称之为“留有余地”。例如，假设赫伯特的债务是一百六十四镑四先令二便士，那我就会说：“留点余地，记成两百镑。”或者，假如我自己的债务是赫伯特的四倍，我也会留有余地，把它们记成七百镑。我曾经对这种留有余地的明智做法极其赞赏，但是我不得不承认，现在回想起来，我认为这是一种代价高昂的策略。因为，我们总是随即就背负上新的债务，填满了所有的余地。为了在面对新的债务时保留自由和偿还能力，我们又得留出一大片新的余地。","My business habits had one other bright feature, which I called “leaving a Margin.”For example; supposing Herbert’s debts to be one hundred and sixty-four pounds four-and-twopence, I would say, “Leave a margin, and put them down at two hundred.”Or, supposing my own to be four times as much, I would leave a margin, and put them down at seven hundred.I had the highest opinion of the wisdom of this same Margin, but I am bound to acknowledge that on looking back, I deem it to have been an expensive device.For, we always ran into new debt immediately, to the full extent of the margin, and sometimes, in the sense of freedom and solvency it imparted, got pretty far on into another margin."
"每一次整理我们的账单之后，我都会感到平静、放松，感到一种道义上的宁静。每每那时，我都非常赞赏自己。我的努力、我的方法以及赫伯特的恭维让我轻松、愉快，我坐在那里，看着眼前桌子上赫伯特那一捆整齐的账单和我自己那一捆整齐的账单摆放在文具之中，感觉那就像是某种银行，而不是一个私人个体。","But there was a calm, a rest, a virtuous hush, consequent on these examinations of our affairs that gave me, for the time, an admirable opinion of myself.Soothed by my exertions, my method, and Herbert’s compliments, I would sit with his symmetrical bundle and my own on the table before me among the stationary, and feel like a Bank of some sort, rather than a private individual."
"在这种庄严的场合，我们都把外面的大门关好，这样才不会被别人打扰。一天晚上，当我已经进入那种宁静的状态，突然我们听到一封信从门缝中被塞了进来，掉落在地板上的声音。“是写给你的，汉德尔，”赫伯特走出去，拿回这封信说道，“我希望没有什么严重的事情。”他之所以这么说是因为这封信带有墨黑色的封口和边框。","We shut our outer door on these solemn occasions, in order that we might not be interrupted.I had fallen into my serene state one evening, when we heard a letter dropped through the slit in the said door, and fall on the ground.“It’s for you, Handel,” said Herbert, going out and coming back with it, “and I hope there is nothing the matter.”This was in allusion to its heavy black seal and border."
"这封信上写着特拉布成衣公司的地址，内容很简单，我被尊称为先生，然后写道他们很抱歉地通知我，乔·格雷戈里夫人于上星期一晚六点二十分去世了，要求我前去参加将于下星期一下午三点举行的葬礼。","The letter was signed TRABB & CO., and its contents were simply, that I was an honored sir, and that they begged to inform me that Mrs. J. Gargery had departed this life on Monday last, at twenty minutes past six in the evening, and that my attendance was requested at the interment on Monday next at three o’clock in the afternoon."
"第三十五章","Chapter 35"
"在我人生的旅途当中，这是第一次遭遇亲人的去世，它在这平坦的大地上留下的印记是令人惊叹的。我姐姐坐在厨房火炉旁那张椅子上的身影日日夜夜萦绕在我的心头。那个地方缺少了她会是什么样子，这似乎是我脑海中无法想象的事情。尽管最近她很少甚至从来都没有出现在我脑海当中，但我却常有那种非常奇怪的念头，那就是她正在大街上朝我迎面走来，或者她马上就会来敲门。在我的房间里也是一样，尽管她从来没有进过我的房间，可这里还是立刻就充斥着一种死亡的空虚感。我一直都能微微地听到她说话的声音，看到她转过脸或转过身来，仿佛她仍然活在世上，而且时常到我房间里来一样。","It was the first time that a grave had opened in my road of life, and the gap it made in the smooth ground was wonderful.The figure of my sister in her chair by the kitchen fire, haunted me night and day.That the place could possibly be, without her, was something my mind seemed unable to compass; and whereas she had seldom or never been in my thoughts of late, I had now the strangest ideas that she was coming towards me in the street, or that she would presently knock at the door.In my rooms too, with which she had never been at all associated, there was at once the blankness of death and a perpetual suggestion of the sound of her voice or the turn of her face or figure, as if she were still alive and had been often there."
"无论我的命运如何，我想起我姐姐的时候都没有太多的温情。但是尽管没有太多温情，我想她的去世还是让我感到惋惜，感到震惊。在这种情感的影响下（也许是为了弥补温情的缺失），我对那个让我姐姐遭受了那么多痛苦的袭击者充满了强烈的愤怒。我想要是有足够的证据证明奥立克或其他任何人是凶手的话，我一定会报复到底。","Whatever my fortunes might have been, I could scarcely have recalled my sister with much tenderness.But I suppose there is a shock of regret which may exist without much tenderness.Under its influence (and perhaps to make up for the want of the softer feeling) I was seized with a violent indignation against the assailant from whom she had suffered so much; and I felt that on sufficient proof I could have revengefully pursued Orlick, or any one else, to the last extremity."
"我给乔写了一封信表示安慰，并且向他保证我一定会去参加葬礼。然后在葬礼之前的那几天，我的思绪一直处于一种很奇特的状态。那天，我一大早就出发了，到达“蓝野猪”饭店的时候尚早，于是我下了车，步行去铁匠铺。","Having written to Joe, to offer consolation, and to assure him that I should come to the funeral, I passed the intermediate days in the curious state of mind I have glanced at.I went down early in the morning, and alighted at the Blue Boar in good time to walk over to the forge."
"又是一个天气晴好的夏日，在我走着的时候，那段自己还是个无助的小孩子而我姐姐从来都没有善待过我的时光生动地浮现在我眼前。但是这些重现的回忆带着一种柔和的色调，即使是那根曾经痛打我的挠痒棒也变得轻柔了。现在，豆荚和红花草的呼吸声仿佛在我心头低声说道：总有一天其他人会这样地走在阳光下来为我送葬，当他们想起我的时候，也会变得柔和、平静。","It was fine summer weather again, and, as I walked along, the times when I was a little helpless creature, and my sister did not spare me, vividly returned.But they returned with a gentle tone upon them that softened even the edge of Tickler.For now, the very breath of the beans and clover whispered to my heart that the day must come when it would be well for my memory that others walking in the sunshine should be softened as they thought of me."
"终于，那座房子出现在我眼前，我看到特拉布成衣公司已经在主导安排葬礼的事情。两个神情忧郁、长相怪异的人站在大门口，每人手中卖弄般地持着一根哀杖，哀杖上面缠着黑纱，仿佛这种器具真的能给人以安慰似的。我认出其中一个人曾经是“蓝野猪”饭店里的马车夫，后来被开除了。因为有一次一对年轻的夫妇在他们新婚的那天早上乘坐这个人的马车，然而这个人因为喝醉酒而不得不在驾驶时用两只胳膊紧紧地抱住马脖子，结果把这对夫妇摔进了锯木坑里。村子里所有的孩子以及大部分的妇女都正在欣赏这些身穿黑孝服的守门人、房屋以及铁匠铺那紧闭的窗户。当我走近门口时，两个守门人中的一个（那个马车夫）替我敲了敲门——他们的意思是我因为悲伤过度而精疲力尽，已经没有力气自己敲门了。","At last I came within sight of the house, and saw that Trabb and Co. had put in a funereal execution and taken possession.Two dismally absurd persons, each ostentatiously exhibiting a crutch done up in a black bandage—as if that instrument could possibly communicate any comfort to anybody—were posted at the front door; and in one of them I recognized a postboy discharged from the Boar for turning a young couple into a sawpit on their bridal morning, in consequence of intoxication rendering it necessary for him to ride his horse clasped round the neck with both arms.All the children of the village, and most of the women, were admiring these sable warders and the closed windows of the house and forge; and as I came up, one of the two warders (the postboy) knocked at the door—implying that I was far too much exhausted by grief, to have strength remaining to knock for myself."
"另一个身穿黑孝服的守门人（一个木匠，他曾经和别人打赌，一口气吃掉了两只鹅）打开了门，把我带进那间最好的客厅里。在这里，特拉布先生自己在那张最好的桌子旁忙活着，他撑起了所有的活动桌板，使用了大量的黑色别针，就像正在举行一场黑色的义卖会。我进去的时候，他刚刚把一个人的帽子放进黑色长衫里，看起来就像一个非洲婴儿一样。然后他伸出手来想接过我的帽子。但是，我理解错了他的这一举动，同时也被这种场合弄得不知所措，结果我非常热情地和他握了握手。","Another sable warder (a carpenter, who had once eaten two geese for a wager) opened the door, and showed me into the best parlor.Here, Mr. Trabb had taken unto himself the best table, and had got all the leaves up, and was holding a kind of black Bazaar, with the aid of a quantity of black pins.At the moment of my arrival, he had just finished putting somebody’s hat into black long-clothes, like an African baby; so he held out his hand for mine.But I, misled by the action, and confused by the occasion, shook hands with him with every testimony of warm affection."
"可怜的、亲爱的乔，他裹在一件小小的黑色披风里，披风的带子在他的下巴底下系成一个大大的蝴蝶结。他一个人坐在房间的上位，作为主要的送葬者，他的位置显然是由特拉布安排的。我俯下身来对他说：“亲爱的乔，你还好吗？”他说：“皮普老弟，你知道她曾经是个多么漂亮的——”他紧紧地握住我的手，没有再说下去。","Poor dear Joe, entangled in a little black cloak tied in a large bow under his chin, was seated apart at the upper end of the room; where, as chief mourner, he had evidently been stationed by Trabb.When I bent down and said to him, “Dear Joe, how are you?” he said, “Pip, old chap, you knowed her when she were a fine figure of a—” and clasped my hand and said no more."
"比迪穿着黑色的丧服，显得非常整洁、朴素。她默默地奔忙于各处，是个非常得力的帮手。由于我觉得眼下不是讲话的时候，所以我问候了比迪之后就来到乔身旁坐了下来。坐在那里，我开始好奇地想知道它——她——我的姐姐——在这个屋子的哪里。客厅的空气里飘散着甜饼的气味，我四下看了看，寻找着摆放糕点的桌子。在一个人适应了这间屋子阴暗的光线之前，这张桌子几乎是看不见的。桌子上有一个切开了的李子蛋糕、一些切开的橙子、一些三明治和饼干、两只玻璃瓶。我非常肯定这两只玻璃瓶是装饰品，但之前却从未看见它们被用过。这次一只瓶子装满了波尔图葡萄酒，另一只装满了雪莉酒。我站在桌子旁的同时，看见了那个奴性十足的彭波契克。他穿着一件黑色的斗篷，上面垂下的帽带有几码长。他一会儿往自己嘴里塞点什么东西，一会儿做些谄媚的动作来引起我的注意。他一见自己成功地引起了我的注意，就朝我走了过来。他满嘴都是雪莉酒和糕饼屑的味道，用温顺、低沉的声音说道：“亲爱的先生，我可以吗？”然后握了握我的手。之后我又看到了哈布尔先生和哈布尔太太。哈布尔太太在角落里泣不成声，她这种情感的突然爆发做得很到位。我们都要跟在送殡队伍的后面，所以每一个人都要被特拉布像包扎一样地打扮一番，打扮成滑稽可笑的包裹。","Biddy, looking very neat and modest in her black dress, went quietly here and there, and was very helpful.When I had spoken to Biddy, as I thought it not a time for talking I went and sat down near Joe, and there began to wonder in what part of the house it—she—my sister—was.The air of the parlor being faint with the smell of sweet cake, I looked about for the table of refreshments; it was scarcely visible until one had got accustomed to the gloom, but there was a cut-up plum-cake upon it, and there were cut-up oranges, and sandwiches, and biscuits, and two decanters that I knew very well as ornaments, but had never seen used in all my life; one full of port, and one of sherry.Standing at this table, I became conscious of the servile Pumblechook in a black cloak and several yards of hatband, who was alternately stuffing himself, and making obsequious movements to catch my attention.The moment he succeeded, he came over to me (breathing sherry and crumbs), and said in a subdued voice, “May I, dear sir?” and did.I then descried Mr. and Mrs. Hubble; the last-named in a decent speechless paroxysm in a corner.We were all going to “follow,” and were all in course of being tied up separately (by Trabb) into ridiculous bundles."
"“我想说的是，皮普，”当我们在客厅里进行特拉布先生所谓的“排队”时，乔小声地跟我说。我们两两站成一排，很像是要准备跳一种非常阴森的舞蹈。“我想说的是，先生，我本想自己把她送到教堂去的，带上三四个愿意来帮忙的朋友一起过去就行了，但是考虑到邻居们的看法，想到他们一定会认为这是对死者不够尊敬，所以也就罢了。”","“Which I meantersay, Pip,” Joe whispered me, as we were being what Mr. Trabb called “formed” in the parlor, two and two—and it was dreadfully like a preparation for some grim kind of dance; “which I meantersay, sir, as I would in preference have carried her to the church myself, along with three or four friendly ones wot come to it with willing harts and arms, but it were considered wot the neighbors would look down on such and would be of opinions as it were wanting in respect.”"
"“所有人都拿出手帕！”这时，特拉布先生用低沉、干脆的声音喊道，“所有人都拿出手帕！我们要开始了！”","“Pocket-handkerchiefs out, all!” cried Mr. Trabb at this point, in a depressed business-like voice.“Pocket-handkerchiefs out!We are ready!”"
"于是，我们都把手帕捂在脸上，就像我们都在流鼻血一样。我们两两站成一排、鱼贯而出：乔和我；比迪和彭波契克；哈布尔先生和哈布尔太太。我那个可怜姐姐的尸体已经抬出了厨房大门，根据传统的殡葬礼仪，六个抬棺人必须要罩在一块巨大的、镶有白边的黑色天鹅绒棺布下面，整个看起来就像一个长了十二条人腿的瞎眼怪物，在两个守门人（那个马车夫和他的同伴）的指引下，拖着脚跌跌撞撞地往前走。","So, we all put our pocket-handkerchiefs to our faces, as if our noses were bleeding, and filed out two and two; Joe and I; Biddy and Pumblechook; Mr. and Mrs. Hubble.The remains of my poor sister had been brought round by the kitchen door, and, it being a point of Undertaking ceremony that the six bearers must be stifled and blinded under a horrible black velvet housing with a white border, the whole looked like a blind monster with twelve human legs, shuffling and blundering along, under the guidance of two keepers—the postboy and his comrade."
"然而，邻居们对这些安排都高度赞赏。我们在村子里走过的时候也是备受赞赏。那些年轻健壮的村民时不时地冲进来，打断我们的队伍，或者抢占有利的观察点，等待我们经过。每到这种时候，他们中那些精力较为旺盛的人看到我们在他们守候的拐角处出现时，就兴奋地大声喊道：“他们来啦！”“他们来啦！”我们差一点就接受到欢呼喝彩声了。在前进的过程中，那个卑贱的彭波契克让我大为恼火。他走在我身后，一路上为了引起我的注意，他不停地整理我帽子上的飘带，用手抹平我的斗篷。我的思绪被哈布尔夫妇过度的自鸣得意而进一步打乱。他们两人因为能成为这一轰动过程当中的成员而极其傲慢、自负。","The neighborhood, however, highly approved of these arrangements, and we were much admired as we went through the village; the more youthful and vigorous part of the community making dashes now and then to cut us off, and lying in wait to intercept us at points of vantage.At such times the more exuberant among them called out in an excited manner on our emergence round some corner of expectancy, “Here they come!”“Here they are!” and we were all but cheered.In this progress I was much annoyed by the abject Pumblechook, who, being behind me, persisted all the way as a delicate attention in arranging my streaming hatband, and smoothing my cloak.My thoughts were further distracted by the excessive pride of Mr. and Mrs. Hubble, who were surpassingly conceited and vainglorious in being members of so distinguished a procession."
"现在，一大片沼泽地清晰地展现在我们面前，河面上的船帆也显露出来。我们走进了墓地，来到与我素未蒙面的父母亲的墓旁，墓碑上写着“本教区已故居民菲利普·皮里普及上述者之妻乔治亚娜。就在那里，我姐姐被轻轻地入土安葬了。云雀在墓穴上空鸣唱，微风拂过，云朵与树木的美丽倒影撒落在坟头。","And now, the range of marshes lay clear before us, with the sails of the ships on the river growing out of it; and we went into the churchyard, close to the graves of my unknown parents, Philip Pirrip, late of this parish, and Also Georgiana, Wife of the Above.And there, my sister was laid quietly in the earth while the larks sang high above it, and the light wind strewed it with beautiful shadows of clouds and trees."
"对于在下葬过程中，那个追逐名利的彭波契克的所作所为，我不愿意再多说了，总之就是所有都是做给我看的。甚至当牧师在诵读那些高尚的悼词，提醒人们，人降临时无所带来，离世时无所带去，如影子般转瞬即逝，从未在一处停留多时的时候，我听见他咳嗽以表示疑义，他的例证就是一个出乎意料地继承了一大笔遗产的年轻人。当我们从墓地里回来之后，他竟敢告诉我说，他希望我姐姐能知道我给她带来了多大的荣耀，还暗示说我姐姐会觉得以她的死为代价换来这一切是值得的。说完之后，他喝光了剩下所有的雪莉酒，哈布尔先生喝光了波尔图葡萄酒。他们两个人交谈着（后来我发现这是这种场合中的惯例），仿佛他们俩是与死者非常不同的种族，是那种臭名昭著、长生不老的人。最后，他终于和哈布尔夫妇一起离开了——我肯定他会花上整整一个晚上“在三个快活船员”酒馆里大谈自己是我财产的奠基人，是我最早的恩人。","Of the conduct of the worldly-minded Pumblechook while this was doing, I desire to say no more than it was all addressed to me; and that even when those noble passages were read which remind humanity how it brought nothing into the world and can take nothing out, and how it fleeth like a shadow and never continueth long in one stay, I heard him cough a reservation of the case of a young gentleman who came unexpectedly into large property.When we got back, he had the hardihood to tell me that he wished my sister could have known I had done her so much honor, and to hint that she would have considered it reasonably purchased at the price of her death.After that, he drank all the rest of the sherry, and Mr. Hubble drank the port, and the two talked (which I have since observed to be customary in such cases) as if they were of quite another race from the deceased, and were notoriously immortal.Finally, he went away with Mr. and Mrs. Hubble—to make an evening of it, I felt sure, and to tell the Jolly Bargemen that he was the founder of my fortunes and my earliest benefactor."
"当他们都离开了，当特拉布和他的手下们（不包括他的那个小伙计，因为我到处找都没有看到他）把他们的道具都塞进袋子里也离开了之后，这个屋子才让人更舒服点了。不久之后，比迪、乔还有我一起吃了一顿冷冷的晚餐。不过我们是在那个最好的客厅里用餐，而没有像以往一样在厨房里用餐。乔对刀叉和盐瓶的使用极其小心谨慎，这让我们都受到很大的约束。晚餐之后，我让他点上烟斗，陪他在铁匠铺周围散了散步，然后一起坐在铁匠铺外面的大石头上，这时我们的心情都好些了。我注意到，乔在葬礼之后已经换了一身衣服。这身衣服的风格介于他的节日礼服和工作服之间。穿上这身衣服，这位可爱的伙计看起来很自然，就像他曾经那样。","When they were all gone, and when Trabb and his men—but not his boy: I looked for him—had crammed their mummery into bags, and were gone too, the house felt wholesomer.Soon afterwards, Biddy, Joe, and I, had a cold dinner together; but we dined in the best parlor, not in the old kitchen, and Joe was so exceedingly particular what he did with his knife and fork and the saltcellar and what not, that there was great restraint upon us.But after dinner, when I made him take his pipe, and when I had loitered with him about the forge, and when we sat down together on the great block of stone outside it, we got on better.I noticed that after the funeral Joe changed his clothes so far, as to make a compromise between his Sunday dress and working dress: in which the dear fellow looked natural, and like the Man he was."
"我问他我能否在自己的小屋里睡觉，他听了非常高兴，我也很高兴，因为，我觉得自己能提出这样的请求，是一件很了不起的事。当夜幕渐渐笼罩下来时，我找了个机会与比迪一起到花园里说了一会儿话。","He was very much pleased by my asking if I might sleep in my own little room, and I was pleased too; for, I felt that I had done rather a great thing in making the request.When the shadows of evening were closing in, I took an opportunity of getting into the garden with Biddy for a little talk."
"“比迪，”我说，“我本以为你会写信告诉我这些让人悲伤的事的。”","“Biddy,” said I, “I think you might have written to me about these sad matters.”"
"“是吗，皮普先生？”比迪说，“要是我想到了这一点的话，我早就写了。”","“Do you, Mr. Pip?” said Biddy.“I should have written if I had thought that.”"
"“要是我说我认为你本应该想到这一点的话，你可别觉得我是要责怪你。”","“Don’t suppose that I mean to be unkind, Biddy, when I say I consider that you ought to have thought that.”"
"“是吗，皮普先生？”","“Do you, Mr. Pip?”"
"她是那么安静，她做事是那么有条有理，她整个人是那样善良美丽，所以我不想再把她惹哭了。当她走在我的身旁，我看了看她那一直朝下看的眼睛，然后我放弃了那个话题。","She was so quiet, and had such an orderly, good, and pretty way with her, that I did not like the thought of making her cry again.After looking a little at her downcast eyes as she walked beside me, I gave up that point."
"“我想你很难在这里呆下去了，是吗，亲爱的比迪？”","“I suppose it will be difficult for you to remain here now, Biddy dear?”"
"“哦！我不能在这里呆下去了，皮普先生。”比迪用遗憾的口吻说道，但是语气平静而坚定，“我已经和哈布尔太太说过了，我明天就到她那里去。我希望在格雷戈里先生安顿下来之前，我们能一起照顾照顾他。”","“Oh! I can’t do so, Mr. Pip,” said Biddy, in a tone of regret, but still of quiet conviction.“I have been speaking to Mrs. Hubble, and I am going to her tomorrow.I hope we shall be able to take some care of Mr. Gargery, together, until he settles down.”"
"“你靠什么来生活呢，比迪？　如果你需要钱——”","“How are you going to live, Biddy?If you want any mo—”"
"“我靠什么生活？”比迪的重复打断了我的话，她的脸红了一阵子。“我来告诉你，皮普先生。这里有一所快要竣工的学校，我会争取到一份教师的工作。我能得到所有邻居的大力推荐，我希望我能够很勤奋、很耐心，在教育别人的同时也能教育自己。你知道的，皮普先生，”比迪抬起眼看着我的脸，她笑着继续说道，“新学校与那所旧学校不一样，但是来到这里之后我从你那里学到很多东西，而且自那以后我也有时间来提高自己。”","“How am I going to live?” repeated Biddy, striking in, with a momentary flush upon her face.“I’ll tell you, Mr. Pip.I am going to try to get the place of mistress in the new school nearly finished here.I can be well recommended by all the neighbors, and I hope I can be industrious and patient, and teach myself while I teach others.You know, Mr. Pip,” pursued Biddy, with a smile, as she raised her eyes to my face, “the new schools are not like the old, but I learnt a good deal from you after that time, and have had time since then to improve.”"
"“我觉得你一直都在进步，比迪，不管在什么样的条件下。”","“I think you would always improve, Biddy, under any circumstances.”"
"“唉！除了我性格当中的缺点。”比迪小声说道。","“Ah!Except in my bad side of human nature,” murmured Biddy."
"这并不是责备，而只是不由自主地把自己的想法说出来了而已。好了！我觉得这个话题也要放弃。于是，我又和比迪一起走了一会儿，静静地看着她向下看着的眼睛。","It was not so much a reproach, as an irresistible thinking aloud.Well! I thought I would give up that point too.So, I walked a little further with Biddy, looking silently at her downcast eyes."
"“我还不知道我姐姐去世的一些细节，比迪。”","“I have not heard the particulars of my sister’s death, Biddy.”"
"“没有太多细节，唉，可怜的人啊。她的情况一直很糟糕——尽管后来有所好转，没有恶化——一连四天她都神志不清，一天晚上她突然在喝茶的时间清醒过来，清楚地叫了一声：‘乔。’由于她很长时间都没有说过一个字了，所以我连忙跑去铁匠铺把乔找来。她做手势示意我说，她想让乔靠近她坐下来，想叫我让她用胳膊搂住乔的脖子。于是我让她的胳膊搂住他的脖子，然后她非常满足又满意地把头靠在他的肩膀上。而且不久之后她又说了一声‘乔’，说了一次‘对不起’，说了一次‘皮普’。之后她再也没有抬起头来，仅仅一个小时之后，我们把她放到她自己的床上，因为我们发现她已经去世了。”","“They are very slight, poor thing.She had been in one of her bad states—though they had got better of late, rather than worse—for four days, when she came out of it in the evening, just at teatime, and said quite plainly, ‘Joe.’As she had never said any word for a long while, I ran and fetched in Mr. Gargery from the forge.She made signs to me that she wanted him to sit down close to her, and wanted me to put her arms round his neck.So I put them round his neck, and she laid her head down on his shoulder quite content and satisfied.And so she presently said ‘Joe’ again, and once ‘Pardon,’ and once ‘Pip.’And so she never lifted her head up any more, and it was just an hour later when we laid it down on her own bed, because we found she was gone.”"
"比迪哭了，而那夜色渐浓的花园、那园中的小路和那显现出来的星星在我的视线中变得模糊起来。","Biddy cried; the darkening garden, and the lane, and the stars that were coming out, were blurred in my own sight."
"“什么都没有发现吗，比迪？”","“Nothing was ever discovered, Biddy?”"
"“什么都没有。”","“Nothing.”"
"“你知道奥立克怎么样了？”","“Do you know what is become of Orlick?”"
"“从他衣服的颜色来看，我想他正在采石场工作。”","“I should think from the color of his clothes that he is working in the quarries.”"
"“那么你之后肯定有见过他了？　你为什么要看着小路上那棵黑黑的树啊？”","“Of course you have seen him then?—Why are you looking at that dark tree in the lane?”"
"“在她去世的那天晚上，我看见他就在那边。”","“I saw him there, on the night she died.”"
"“那也不是你最后一次见到他吧，比迪？”","“That was not the last time either, Biddy?”"
"“对，我们在这里散步的时候我就看见他在那里了——没用的，”比迪说着用手拉住我的胳膊，因为我正要跑过去，“你知道我是不会骗你的，他这会儿不在那边了，他已经走了。”","“No; I have seen him there, since we have been walking here.—It is of no use,” said Biddy, laying her hand upon my arm, as I was for running out, “you know I would not deceive you; he was not there a minute, and he is gone.”"
"发现这个家伙仍然缠着比迪让我非常气愤，我感到自己打心眼里厌恶他。我告诉她我很生气，告诉她说我会出高价、花大力气把他赶出这个村子。渐渐地，她让我谈话的语气变得更平和一些了。她告诉我乔有多么爱我，告诉我说乔从来不抱怨任何事情——她并没有说乔从来不抱怨我，她没有这个必要说这些，我也懂她的意思——但是他一直用有力的手和温柔的心，默默地担负着生活中的责任。","It revived my utmost indignation to find that she was still pursued by this fellow, and I felt inveterate against him.I told her so, and told her that I would spend any money or take any pains to drive him out of that country.By degrees she led me into more temperate talk, and she told me how Joe loved me, and how Joe never complained of anything—she didn’t say, of me; she had no need; I knew what she meant—but ever did his duty in his way of life, with a strong hand, a quiet tongue, and a gentle heart."
"“的确，不管怎么夸他都不为过，”我说，“而且，比迪，我们必须经常谈谈这些事情，当然，以后我会经常到这里来。我不会把可怜的乔一个人扔在这里的。”","“Indeed, it would be hard to say too much for him,” said I; “and Biddy, we must often speak of these things, for of course I shall be often down here now.I am not going to leave poor Joe alone.”"
"比迪一个字也没有说。","Biddy said never a single word."
"“比迪，你没有听到我说的话吗？”","“Biddy, don’t you hear me?”"
"“听到了，皮普先生。”","“Yes, Mr. Pip.”"
"“更不用说你总是叫我‘皮普先生’——这让我很不舒服，比迪——你是什么意思？”","“Not to mention your calling me Mr. Pip—which appears to me to be in bad taste, Biddy—what do you mean?”"
"“我是什么意思？”比迪小心翼翼地问道。","“What do I mean?” asked Biddy, timidly. "
"“比迪，”我用一种矜持而又骄横的口气说道，“我必须要知道你这么做是什么意思？”","“Biddy,” said I, in a virtuously self-asserting manner, “I must request to know what you mean by this?”"
"“这么做？”比迪说道。","“By this?” said Biddy."
"“好了，别重复我的话，”我反驳说，“你以前是不会重复我的话的，比迪。”","“Now, don’t echo,” I retorted.“You used not to echo, Biddy.”"
"“以前不会！”比迪说道，“哦，皮普先生！以前！”以前！”","“Used not!” said Biddy.“O Mr. Pip!Used!”"
"好吧！我想我还是把这个话题也放弃了吧。在花园里又默默地转了一圈之后，我又回到主题上去了。","Well! I rather thought I would give up that point too.After another silent turn in the garden, I fell back on the main position."
"“比迪，”我说，“我说我会经常到这里来看乔，对此你却沉默不语。你行行好，比迪，告诉我为什么吧。”","“Biddy,” said I, “I made a remark respecting my coming down here often, to see Joe, which you received with a marked silence.Have the goodness, Biddy, to tell me why.”"
"“那么，你很确定你以后会经常来看他吗？”比迪问道，她在狭窄的花园小径上停了下来，在星空下用她那清澈、诚实的眼睛看着我。","“Are you quite sure, then, that you will come to see him often?” asked Biddy, stopping in the narrow garden walk, and looking at me under the stars with a clear and honest eye."
"“哦，天哪！”我说道，仿佛我发现自己陷入了绝境，不得不放弃比迪。“这真是人性中的缺点！别再说了，拜托你，比迪。这让我非常震惊。”","“Oh dear me!” said I, as if I found myself compelled to give up Biddy in despair.“This really is a very bad side of human nature!Don’t say any more, if you please, Biddy.This shocks me very much.”"
"因为这个很有说服力的原因，我在晚饭的时候故意疏远了比迪，然后尽可能客套地和她告别了之后，我上了楼，来到我自己那个破旧的小屋子。在我内心深处，我认为在经历了墓地送葬和今天一天之后，这都是可以理解的。整个晚上我都辗转反侧，每一刻钟就会醒一次。整夜里我都在想比迪的举动多么刻薄，给我带来了多大的伤害、多大的委屈。","For which cogent reason I kept Biddy at a distance during supper, and, when I went up to my own old little room, took as stately a leave of her as I could, in my murmuring soul, deem reconcilable with the churchyard and the event of the day.As often as I was restless in the night, and that was every quarter of an hour, I reflected what an unkindness, what an injury, what an injustice, Biddy had done me."
"第二天清晨我就得离开了。于是一大早，我就出门了，来到铁匠铺外面，在没有人注意的情况下，透过一扇木头窗户朝里面张望。有好几分钟，我就在那里站着，看着乔。他已经开始工作了，脸上泛着一种健康、强壮的光芒，仿佛是他生命朝阳的光亮正照耀着他。","Early in the morning, I was to go.Early in the morning, I was out, and looking in, unseen, at one of the wooden windows of the forge.There I stood, for minutes, looking at Joe, already at work with a glow of health and strength upon his face that made it show as if the bright sun of the life in store for him were shining on it."
"“再见了，亲爱的乔！——不，不要擦掉——上帝啊，让我握住你那被抹黑了的手吧！——我很快就会回来的，我会经常回来的。”","“Good-bye, dear Joe!—No, don’t wipe it off—for God’s sake, give me your blackened hand!—I shall be down soon, and often.”"
"“不用那么快，先生，”乔说，“也不用那么频繁，皮普！”","“Never too soon, sir,” said Joe, “and never too often, Pip!”"
"比迪正拿着一大杯新鲜牛奶和一块面包皮在厨房门口等着我。“比迪，”分别的时候我向她伸出手来，说道，“我没有生气，但是我很伤心。”","Biddy was waiting for me at the kitchen door, with a mug of new milk and a crust of bread.“Biddy,” said I, when I gave her my hand at parting, “I am not angry, but I am hurt.”"
"“别，不要伤心，”她非常柔弱地恳求道，“如果我之前一直很刻薄的话，就让我一个人伤心好了。”","“No, don’t be hurt,” she pleaded quite pathetically; “let only me be hurt, if I have been ungenerous.”"
"当我离开的时候，大雾再一次弥散开来。如果说他们向我暗示了什么的话——我觉得他们确实这样暗示了——那就是我不用回来了。比迪很对，而我所能说的只有一句——他们都很对。","Once more, the mists were rising as I walked away.If they disclosed to me, as I suspect they did, that I should not come back, and that Biddy was quite right, all I can say is—they were quite right too."
"第三十六章","Chapter 36"
"赫伯特和我每况愈下，债务不断增加，我们检查账目、留有余地，做着这类典型的交易。时间按它自己的方式流逝着，我成年了——这应验了赫伯特的预言，我懵里懵懂地成年了。","Herbert and I went on from bad to worse, in the way of increasing our debts, looking into our affairs, leaving Margins, and the like exemplary transactions; and Time went on, whether or no, as he has a way of doing; and I came of age—in fulfillment of Herbert’s prediction, that I should do so before I knew where I was."
"赫伯特也成年了，比我早八个月。他成年也只是成年而已，这件事在巴纳德旅馆并未引起很大的轰动。但对于我的二十一岁生日，我们还是很期待的，有一大堆的猜想和期望，因为我们两个都认为我的监护人在那天一定会忍不住透露些什么。","Herbert himself had come of age, eight months before me.As he had nothing else than his majority to come into, the event did not make a profound sensation in Barnard’s Inn.But we had looked forward to my one-and-twentieth birthday, with a crowd of speculations and anticipations, for we had both considered that my guardian could hardly help saying something definite on that occasion."
"我事先就小心翼翼地在小不列颠街放出风声，让大家知道我的生日是哪一天。在我生日的前一天，我收到了一封温米克寄来的正式信件，上面写着贾格尔斯先生邀请我在那个吉日的下午五点拜访他。我们确信有什么大事要发生，我十分准时地走进我监护人的办公室，心里惴惴不安。","I had taken care to have it well understood in Little Britain, when my birthday was.On the day before it, I received an official note from Wemmick, informing me that Mr. Jaggers would be glad if I would call upon him at five in the afternoon of the auspicious day.This convinced us that something great was to happen, and threw me into an unusual flutter when I repaired to my guardian’s office, a model of punctuality."
"温米克在外间办公室祝贺我，不经意地用一张叠着的纸巾擦了擦鼻翼，我喜欢这张纸巾的样子。可他没有说关于这方面的事，而是点头示意我去我监护人的房间。这时正值十一月，我的监护人站在火炉前，背靠壁炉架，双手放在他上衣的后摆下面。","In the outer office Wemmick offered me his congratulations, and incidentally rubbed the side of his nose with a folded piece of tissue paper that I liked the look of.But he said nothing respecting it, and motioned me with a nod into my guardian’s room.It was November, and my guardian was standing before his fire leaning his back against the chimney-piece, with his hands under his coattails."
"“哦，皮普，”他说，“我今天得叫你皮普先生了。祝贺你，皮普先生。”","“Well, Pip,” said he, “I must call you Mr. Pip today.Congratulations, Mr. Pip.”"
"我们握了握手——他一向握手时间极短——我向他表示谢意。","We shook hands—he was always a remarkably short shaker—and I thanked him."
"“坐吧，皮普先生。”我的监护人说。","“Take a chair, Mr. Pip,” said my guardian."
"我坐下后，他保持着这种姿势，低头看了看脚上的靴子，我感到情况不妙，这让我想起过去我被放到墓碑上的情形。离他不远的架子上立着两座面目狰狞的塑像，他们的表情显得愚蠢而激动，好像是试图加入到我们的谈话中来。","As I sat down, and he preserved his attitude and bent his brows at his boots, I felt at a disadvantage, which reminded me of that old time when I had been put upon a tombstone.The two ghastly casts on the shelf were not far from him, and their expression was as if they were making a stupid apoplectic attempt to attend to the conversation."
"“我年轻的朋友，”我的监护人开始说话了，好像我是法庭证人席上的证人一样，“我要跟你说几句话。”","“Now my young friend,” my guardian began, as if I were a witness in the box, “I am going to have a word or two with you.”"
"“请说吧，先生。”","“If you please, sir.”"
"“你认为，”贾格尔斯先生说着弯下腰看了看地面，然后抬起头继续看着天花板，“你认为你花钱有多快？”","“What do you suppose,” said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward to look at the ground, and then throwing his head back to look at the ceiling, “what do you suppose you are living at the rate of?”"
"“花钱有多快，先生？”","“At the rate of, sir?”"
"“嗯，”贾格尔斯先生重复了一遍，眼睛仍然看着天花板，“有多快？”然后，他扫视了一下屋子，手里捏着的手帕还没碰到鼻子，悬在半空中。","“At,” repeated Mr. Jaggers, still looking at the ceiling, “the—rate—of?”And then looked all round the room, and paused with his pocket-handkerchief in his hand, half way to his nose."
"我经常检查自己的财务状况，至于它们会造成怎样的影响，我可压根没想过。我不情愿地承认，这个问题我实在答不上来。这个回答看来正合贾格尔斯先生的意，他说：“我就知道是这样！”他搓了搓鼻子，脸上露出满意的神情。","I had looked into my affairs so often, that I had thoroughly destroyed any slight notion I might ever have had of their bearings.Reluctantly, I confessed myself quite unable to answer the question.This reply seemed agreeable to Mr. Jaggers, who said, “I thought so!” and blew his nose with an air of satisfaction."
"“好了，我问了你一个问题了，我的朋友。”贾格尔斯先生说，“你有什么问题要问我吗？”","“Now, I have asked you a question, my friend,” said Mr. Jaggers.“Have you anything to ask me?”"
"“当然，如果可以问您几个问题的话，我会觉得心里的石头落了地，先生，可是我记得您的禁令。”","“Of course it would be a great relief to me to ask you several questions, sir; but I remember your prohibition.”"
"“问一个吧。”贾格尔斯先生说。","“Ask one,” said Mr. Jaggers."
"“您今天可以告诉我，我的捐助人是谁吗？”","“Is my benefactor to be made known to me today?”"
"“不行。换一个问题吧。”","“No.Ask another.”"
"“我很快就能知道这个秘密了吗？”","“Is that confidence to be imparted to me soon?”"
"“目前不要问这个问题。”贾格尔斯先生说，“再换一个吧。”","“Waive that, a moment,” said Mr. Jaggers, “and ask another.”"
"我四下里看了看，眼下有一个问题看来是不得不问了：“我——我收到什么礼物了吗，先生？”听我这么问，贾格尔斯先生得意洋洋地说：“我想我们该谈谈这个了！”他叫来温米克，让他把那张纸拿来。温米克来了，把纸递给他，然后又走了。","I looked about me, but there appeared to be now no possible escape from the inquiry, “Have—I—anything to receive, sir?”On that, Mr. Jaggers said, triumphantly, “I thought we should come to it!” and called to Wemmick to give him that piece of paper.Wemmick appeared, handed it in, and disappeared."
"“嗯，皮普先生，”贾格尔斯先生说，“请你注意听好了。你在这里取钱是很随意的，你的名字总是出现在温米克的现金簿上，但你一定还欠着钱呢，是吧？”","“Now, Mr. Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, “attend, if you please.You have been drawing pretty freely here; your name occurs pretty often in Wemmick’s cash-book; but you are in debt, of course?”"
"“我恐怕不得不承认，先生。”","“I am afraid I must say yes, sir.”"
"“你知道你得承认，不是吗？”贾格尔斯先生说。","“You know you must say yes; don’t you?” said Mr. Jaggers."
"“是的，先生。”","“Yes, sir.”"
"“我不问你欠了多少，因为你也不知道，就算你知道，你也不会告诉我，你会少报一些的。是的，是的，我的朋友。”贾格尔斯先生喊着，我刚要表示抗议，他摇着食指阻止我这么做，“你很可能认为你不会这么做，但你会的。原谅我这么说，可我比你自己还了解你呢。嗨，把这张纸拿去。你拿好了？很好。好了，打开它，告诉我，上面写着什么。”","“I don’t ask you what you owe, because you don’t know; and if you did know, you wouldn’t tell me; you would say less.Yes, yes, my friend,” cried Mr. Jaggers, waving his forefinger to stop me, as I made a show of protesting: “it’s likely enough that you think you wouldn’t, but you would.You’ll excuse me, but I know better than you.Now, take this piece of paper in your hand.You have got it?Very good.Now, unfold it and tell me what it is.”"
"“这是一张银行支票。”我说，“一张五百英镑的支票。”","“This is a bank-note,” said I, “for five hundred pounds.”"
"“是一张银行支票。”贾格尔斯先生重复了一遍，“一张五百英镑的支票。还是相当大的一笔钱呢，我认为。你也这么认为吧？”","“That is a bank-note,” repeated Mr. Jaggers, “for five hundred pounds.And a very handsome sum of money too, I think.You consider it so?”"
"“我还能怎么想！”","“How could I do otherwise!”"
"“啊！请回答我的问题。”贾格尔斯先生说，","“Ah!But answer the question,” said Mr. Jaggers."
"“毫无疑问。”","“Undoubtedly.”"
"“你觉得，毫无疑问，这是相当大的一笔钱。现在，皮普，这一大笔钱是你的了。这是你今天的礼物，是你继承遗产的开端。你每年都能收到那样一笔数额可观的钱，不能超过那个数额。你用这笔钱生活，直到你的捐助人出现为止。也就是说，现在你可以自己管理自己的账目了，每个季度可以从温米克那里领一百二十五英镑，直到你跟你的财源商议，不再需要我们做唯一代理人为止。我以前就跟你说过，我是唯一的代理人。我按指示办事，谁付我钱，我就为谁办事。我觉得他们不公正，但人家付钱不是要听我对他们的评价的。”","“You consider it, undoubtedly, a handsome sum of money.Now, that handsome sum of money, Pip, is your own.It is a present to you on this day, in earnest of your expectations.And at the rate of that handsome sum of money per annum, and at no higher rate, you are to live until the donor of the whole appears.That is to say, you will now take your money affairs entirely into your own hands, and you will draw from Wemmick one hundred and twenty-five pounds per quarter, until you are in communication with the fountain-head, and no longer with the mere agent.As I have told you before, I am the mere agent.I execute my instructions, and I am paid for doing so.I think them injudicious, but I am not paid for giving any opinion on their merits.”"
"我刚要开始表达对捐助人的感激，感激他对我如此慷慨时，贾格尔斯先生就止住了我的话。“皮普，人家付我钱，”他冷冷地说，“不是要我为你传话的。”他整理了一下大衣下摆，收起了这个话题，站在那里皱着眉看着他的靴子，好像怀疑这靴子存心跟他过不去似的。","I was beginning to express my gratitude to my benefactor for the great liberality with which I was treated, when Mr. Jaggers stopped me.“I am not paid, Pip,” said he, coolly, “to carry your words to any one;” and then gathered up his coat-tails, as he had gathered up the subject, and stood frowning at his boots as if he suspected them of designs against him."
"过了一会儿，我含蓄地问他：","After a pause, I hinted:"
"“贾格尔斯先生，刚才我有一个问题，您让我目前不要问。我希望，这个问题我再问一遍没有什么不对吧？”","“There was a question just now, Mr. Jaggers, which you desired me to waive for a moment.I hope I am doing nothing wrong in asking it again?”"
"“什么问题？”他问。","“What is it?” said he."
"我早该知道他是不会帮我的，但是我还是很惊讶得把这个问题重新说一遍，就好像这是个全新的问题一样。“有没有可能，”犹豫了一下后，我说，“我的恩主，也就是您所说的财源，贾格尔斯先生，他不久就会——”我小心翼翼地停了一下。","I might have known that he would never help me out; but it took me aback to have to shape the question afresh, as if it were quite new.“Is it likely,” I said, after hesitating, “that my patron, the fountain-head you have spoken of, Mr. Jaggers, will soon—” there I delicately stopped."
"“不久会怎么样？”贾格尔斯先生问道，“你知道，问了一半的问题不是问题。”","“Will soon what?” asked Mr. Jaggers.“That’s no question as it stands, you know.”"
"“不久就会来伦敦。”我搜索着恰当的词来表达，“或者叫我去别的什么地方？”","“Will soon come to London,” said I, after casting about for a precise form of words, “or summon me anywhere else?”"
"“听着，”贾格尔斯先生第一次用他那深陷下去的黑色眼睛盯着我说，“我们得回想一下在你住的村子里，我们第一次见面那晚的情形。那时我跟你说什么了，皮普？”","“Now here,” replied Mr. Jaggers, fixing me for the first time with his dark deep-set eyes, “we must revert to the evening when we first encountered one another in your village.What did I tell you then, Pip?”"
"“贾格尔斯先生，您跟我说，那个人可能要很多年以后才会出现。”","“You told me, Mr. Jaggers, that it might be years hence when that person appeared.”"
"“是这样。”贾格尔斯先生说，“这就是我的回答。”","“Just so,” said Mr. Jaggers; “that’s my answer.”"
"我们对视了好一阵子，我感到自己呼吸急促起来，非常着急地想要从他口里得知些什么。我感到自己的呼吸越来越急促了，我感到他也发现了这个变化，我感到要是想从他口里得知些什么的话，我的机会是越来越渺茫了。","As we looked full at one another, I felt my breath come quicker in my strong desire to get something out of him.And as I felt that it came quicker, and as I felt that he saw that it came quicker, I felt that I had less chance than ever of getting anything out of him."
"“贾格尔斯先生，您认为还要等很多年吗？”","“Do you suppose it will still be years hence, Mr. Jaggers?”"
"贾格尔斯先生摇了摇头——不是表示他否定这个问题，而是表示他绝不可能回答这个问题——我眼睛四处游荡时，向上看见了那两座狰狞、面部痉挛的塑像，它们好像已经听得焦急不安，想要打喷嚏的样子。","Mr. Jaggers shook his head—not in negativing the question, but in altogether negativing the notion that he could anyhow be got to answer it—and the two horrible casts of the twitched faces looked, when my eyes strayed up to them, as if they had come to a crisis in their suspended attention, and were going to sneeze."
"“得了！”贾格尔斯先生用取过暖的手背擦了擦腿肚子，说道，“皮普，我的朋友，我跟你说实话吧。我不会回答这个问题的。你会明白的，这样更好，我要是告诉了你，我可能要受到牵连。好吧！我进一步跟你说吧，我再告诉你一些吧。”","“Come!” said Mr. Jaggers, warming the backs of his legs with the backs of his warmed hands, “I’ll be plain with you, my friend Pip.That’s a question I must not be asked.You’ll understand that, better, when I tell you it’s a question that might compromise me.Come! I’ll go a little further with you; I’ll say something more.”"
"他把腰弯得很低，皱着眉看着他的靴子，这样他才得以停下来搓一搓腿肚子。","He bent down so low to frown at his boots, that he was able to rub the calves of his legs in the pause he made."
"“只要那人一露面，”贾格尔斯先生直了直身子说，“你们的事就由你们自行处理吧。只要那人一露面，我对这事的责任就完结了。只要那人一露面，我就没有必要再知道你这件事的进展情况了。我要说的就这么多了。”","“When that person discloses,” said Mr. Jaggers, straightening himself, “you and that person will settle your own affairs.When that person discloses, my part in this business will cease and determine.When that person discloses, it will not be necessary for me to know anything about it.And that’s all I have got to say.”"
"我们对视了一阵子后，我把视线移开了，若有所思地看着地板。从他最后说的话里我得出了这么个想法：出于某种理由，或者没有理由，郝维仙小姐并没有把他当做心腹，没有告诉他要把埃斯特拉许配给我的事，他对此耿耿于怀、嫉妒不已，或者他的确反对这个安排，就不想和这件事情有什么关系。当我再次抬起头时，发现他一直用敏锐的目光盯着我，我抬头的时候他还在盯着我。","We looked at one another until I withdrew my eyes, and looked thoughtfully at the floor.From this last speech I derived the notion that Miss Havisham, for some reason or no reason, had not taken him into her confidence as to her designing me for Estella; that he resented this, and felt a jealousy about it; or that he really did object to that scheme, and would have nothing to do with it.When I raised my eyes again, I found that he had been shrewdly looking at me all the time, and was doing so still."
"“先生，如果您要跟我说的就是这些，”我说，“那我没有什么要说的了。”","“If that is all you have to say, sir,” I remarked, “there can be nothing left for me to say.”"
"他点头表示同意，掏出他那小偷见了都害怕的表，问我打算去哪里吃晚饭。我说跟赫伯特在自己家里吃。话已至此，我顺着话题问他是否愿意赏脸跟我们一起吃，他立刻就答应了我的邀请。但他坚持跟我一起走回家，以免我特地为了他张罗一番，不过，他得先写一两封信，然后（当然）得洗个手。因此，我说我想到外间办公室去，跟温米克聊聊。","He nodded assent, and pulled out his thief-dreaded watch, and asked me where I was going to dine?I replied at my own chambers, with Herbert.As a necessary sequence, I asked him if he would favour us with his company, and he promptly accepted the invitation.But he insisted on walking home with me, in order that I might make no extra preparation for him, and first he had a letter or two to write, and (of course) had his hands to wash.So, I said I would go into the outer office and talk to Wemmick."
"事实是，五百英镑到了我手上，我有了一个想法，这个想法以前我就想过多次。在我看来，温米克在这个问题上是个很会出主意的人。","The fact was, that when the five hundred pounds had come into my pocket, a thought had come into my head which had been often there before; and it appeared to me that Wemmick was a good person to advise with, concerning such thought."
"他已经锁上了他的保险箱，准备回家。他已经离开了办公桌，拿出两只油乎乎的烛台，把它们和烛剪一起并排放在门边的一块厚板上，准备熄灭烛火。他封好了炉火，戴上了帽子，穿好了大衣，保险箱钥匙在他胸前跳动着，好像在做一种下班后的体育锻炼。","He had already locked up his safe, and made preparations for going home.He had left his desk, brought out his two greasy office candlesticks and stood them in line with the snuffers on a slab near the door, ready to be extinguished; he had raked his fire low, put his hat and great-coat ready, and was beating himself all over the chest with his safe-key, as an athletic exercise after business."
"“温米克先生，”我说，“我想问问您的意见。我非常想帮一个朋友。”","“Mr. Wemmick,” said I, “I want to ask your opinion.I am very desirous to serve a friend.”"
"温米克紧闭着他那邮筒一样的嘴，摇了摇头，好像他对帮助别人这种致命的弱点是持坚决的反对态度的。","Wemmick tightened his post-office and shook his head, as if his opinion were dead against any fatal weakness of that sort."
"“我这个朋友，”我继续说道，“打算经商，但没有钱，他发现生意很难启动，有些灰心。现在，我想设法帮他着手启动生意。”","“This friend,” I pursued, “is trying to get on in commercial life, but has no money, and finds it difficult and disheartening to make a beginning.Now, I want somehow to help him to a beginning.”"
"“投钱进去？”温米克用一种比锯屑还要生硬的语调问。","“With money down?” said Wemmick, in a tone drier than any sawdust."
"“投一些钱进去。”我答道，突然想起家里那一捆对称的账单，我感到不自在，“投一些钱进去，也许还要把我的一些遗产投进去。”","“With some money down,” I replied, for an uneasy remembrance shot across me of that symmetrical bundle of papers at home; “with some money down, and perhaps some anticipation of my expectations.”"
"“皮普先生，”温米克说，“你要是高兴，我愿意数着手指头把每一座桥的名字数给你听，一直数到切尔西区河段。我们来看一看：一、伦敦桥，二、南华克桥，三、黑修道士桥，四、滑铁卢桥，五、威斯敏斯特桥，六、沃克斯豪尔桥。”他轮番清点着每一座桥，手里握着保险箱钥匙的把手。“你看，有六座桥可以选择呢。”","“Mr. Pip,” said Wemmick, “I should like just to run over with you on my fingers, if you please, the names of the various bridges up as high as Chelsea Reach.Let’s see; there’s London, one; Southwark, two; Blackfriars, three; Waterloo, four; Westminster, five; Vauxhall, six.”He had checked off each bridge in its turn, with the handle of his safe-key on the palm of his hand.“There’s as many as six, you see, to choose from.”"
"“我不明白。”我说。","“I don’t understand you,” said I."
"“你选一座桥吧，皮普先生。”温米克说，“到桥上走一走，在桥中心把钱扔到泰晤士河里去，结果怎样你就知道了。用钱来帮朋友，这么做结果怎样你也许会知道——但是这样做，不如把钱扔进河里有意思、有回报。”","“Choose your bridge, Mr. Pip,” returned Wemmick, “and take a walk upon your bridge, and pitch your money into the Thames over the centre arch of your bridge, and you know the end of it.Serve a friend with it, and you may know the end of it too—but it’s a less pleasant and profitable end.”"
"他说完这番话后，嘴张得老大，大得我都可以塞一张报纸进去。","I could have posted a newspaper in his mouth, he made it so wide after saying this."
"“这真让人扫兴。”我说。","“This is very discouraging,” said I."
"“注定是这样。”温米克说。","“Meant to be so,” said Wemmick."
"“那么，你认为，”我有点愤怒地问他，“一个人决不能——”","“Then is it your opinion,” I inquired, with some little indignation, “that a man should never—”"
"“——把动产投资在朋友身上？”温米克说，“当然不能。除非他想摆脱这个朋友——至于摆脱这个朋友值得花多少动产，这又成了问题。”","“—Invest portable property in a friend?” said Wemmick.“Certainly he should not.Unless he wants to get rid of the friend—and then it becomes a question how much portable property it may be worth to get rid of him.”"
"“这个，”我说，“就是你深思熟虑之后的意见吗，温米克先生？”","“And that,” said I, “is your deliberate opinion, Mr. Wemmick?”"
"“这个，”他回答我说，“就是我在办公室里深思熟虑后的意见。”","“That,” he returned, “is my deliberate opinion in this office.”"
"“啊！”我想他这话让我有空子可钻，就进一步逼问他，“你在沃尔沃思也是这么想的吗？”","“Ah!” said I, pressing him, for I though I saw him near a loophole here; “but would that be your opinion at Walworth?”"
"“皮普先生，”他严肃地答道，“沃尔沃思是一回事，这里是另一回事。就好像那个老人家是一回事，贾格尔斯先生是另一回事一样。不要把这两者混为一谈。我在沃尔沃思的那套看法只有在沃尔沃思才可行，而在这里就要有这里的看法。”","“Mr. Pip,” he replied, with gravity, “Walworth is one place, and this office is another.Much as the Aged is one person, and Mr. Jaggers is another.They must not be confounded together.My Walworth sentiments must be taken at Walworth; none but my official sentiments can be taken in this office.”"
"“很好。”我松了一口气，说，“那我应该到沃尔沃思去拜访您，我说真的。”","“Very well,” said I, much relieved, “then I shall look you up at Walworth, you may depend upon it.”"
"“皮普先生，”他说，“欢迎你以私人和个人的身份来看我。”","“Mr. Pip,” he returned, “you will be welcome there, in a private and personal capacity.”"
"我们谈话一直很小声，我们都很清楚，我的监护人的耳朵比谁都尖。他在门道里，用毛巾擦着手。温米克穿上他的大衣，站在一旁准备熄灭蜡烛。我们三个一齐走到了街上，在门阶上分开了，温米克走他的路，贾格尔斯先生和我走我们的路。","We had held this conversation in a low voice, well knowing my guardian’s ears to be the sharpest of the sharp.As he now appeared in his doorway, towelling his hands, Wemmick got on his greatcoat and stood by to snuff out the candles.We all three went into the street together, and from the door-step Wemmick turned his way, and Mr. Jaggers and I turned ours."
"那天晚上我不止一次地希望贾格尔斯先生在杰勒德街有一位老人家，或者一个讽刺者，或者别的什么事、别的什么人，能让他的眉头舒展一些。二十一岁生日这天发生的这些让我心里很不舒服，在他一手造成的这样一个饱受监视、满是猜疑的世界里，成年这件事看起来一点也不值得。他比温米克见多识广一千倍，也比他聪明一千倍，但我一千倍地希望跟我一起吃晚饭的是温米克而不是他。被贾格尔斯先生弄得郁闷无比的可不止我一人，因为，他走了以后，赫伯特两眼盯着火炉，说他一定是犯了重罪，关于犯罪的细节却想不起来，他觉得万分沮丧，觉得自己罪孽深重。","I could not help wishing more than once that evening, that Mr. Jaggers had had an Aged in Gerrard-street, or a Stinger, or a Something, or a Somebody, to unbend his brows a little.It was an uncomfortable consideration on a twenty-first birthday, that coming of age at all seemed hardly worth while in such a guarded and suspicious world as he made of it.He was a thousand times better informed and cleverer than Wemmick, and yet I would a thousand times rather have had Wemmick to dinner.And Mr. Jaggers made not me alone intensely melancholy, because, after he was gone, Herbert said of himself, with his eyes fixed on the fire, that he thought he must have committed a felony and forgotten the details of it, he felt so dejected and guilty."
"第三十七章","Chapter 37"
"我认为星期天是听取温米克在沃尔沃思的看法的最佳日子。于是，接下来那个星期天的下午，我去他的宅子拜访了他。在到达城垛以前，我发现英国国旗在城头上飘扬，吊桥被高高悬起。但是这样富于挑衅意味的情景没有阻止我的前进，我朝着大门跑去，老人家心平气和地开了门让我进去。","Deeming Sunday the best day for taking Mr. Wemmick’s Walworth sentiments, I devoted the next ensuing Sunday afternoon to a pilgrimage to the Castle.On arriving before the battlements, I found the Union Jack flying and the drawbridge up; but undeterred by this show of defiance and resistance, I rang at the gate, and was admitted in a most pacific manner by the Aged."
"“先生，”老人栓牢吊桥，对我说，“我儿子料到你可能恰巧会来，他留话说他等会散完步就回来。他散步非常有规律，我儿子是这样的。什么事都很有规律，我儿子是这样的。”","“My son, sir,” said the old man, after securing the drawbridge, “rather had it in his mind that you might happen to drop in, and he left word that he would soon be home from his afternoon’s walk.He is very regular in his walks, is my son.Very regular in everything, is my son.”"
"我对这位老绅士点了点头，温米克听了这话，可能也要点头的，我们进了屋，围着火炉坐下了。","I nodded at the old gentleman as Wemmick himself might have nodded, and we went in and sat down by the fireside."
"“先生，你跟我儿子，”老人伸出手靠近火炉取暖，用一种嘁嘁喳喳的方式说，“是在他事务所里认识的吧，我想？”我点了点头。“哈！我听说我儿子在业务上很在行，是吗，先生？”我使劲点头。“没错，他们是这么跟我说的。他干的是法律这一行？”我更加使劲地点头。“我儿子更让人惊讶的就是这点。”老人说，“他不是干法律这行出身的，他是箍酒桶出身的。”","“You made acquaintance with my son, sir,” said the old man, in his chirping way, while he warmed his hands at the blaze, “at his office, I expect?”I nodded.“Hah! I have heerd that my son is a wonderful hand at his business, sir?”I nodded hard.“Yes; so they tell me.His business is the Law?”I nodded harder.“Which makes it more surprising in my son,” said the old man, “for he was not brought up to the Law, but to the Wine-Coopering.”"
"我很想知道这位老绅士会怎么评价贾格尔斯先生，于是就大声地跟他说贾格尔斯先生的名字。他之后的反应让我感到很迷惑。他大笑了起来，神采奕奕地回答我说：“当然不是，你是对的。”这一刻，我一点都不明白他的意思，也不明白他认为我开了个什么玩笑。","Curious to know how the old gentleman stood informed concerning the reputation of Mr. Jaggers, I roared that name at him.He threw me into the greatest confusion by laughing heartily and replying in a very sprightly manner, “No, to be sure; you’re right.”And to this hour I have not the faintest notion what he meant, or what joke he thought I had made."
"我不能坐在那里不停地点头，而不试着找点让他感兴趣的话题，于是我大声问他，他是不是干箍酒桶这一行的。我把“箍酒桶的”这个词说了好几次，每次说到这个词就在他胸口拍一下，表示我说的就是他。用这样的方式，我总算让他明白了我的意思。","As I could not sit there nodding at him perpetually, without making some other attempt to interest him, I shouted at inquiry whether his own calling in life had been “the Wine-Coopering.”By dint of straining that term out of myself several times and tapping the old gentleman on the chest to associate it with him, I at last succeeded in making my meaning understood."
"“不是。”这位老绅士说，“仓库，仓库。一开始，在那边。”他好像指的是烟囱的方向，但我确定他想指给我看的是利物浦，“然后到伦敦城里来了。不过，后来我生了病——听力出了毛病，先生——”","“No,” said the old gentleman; “the warehousing, the warehousing.First, over yonder;” he appeared to mean up the chimney, but I believe he intended to refer me to Liverpool; “and then in the City of London here.However, having an infirmity—for I am hard of hearing, sir—”"
"我打着手势表达我的惊讶。","I expressed in pantomime the greatest astonishment."
"“——是的，听力出了毛病。我得了这个病以后，我儿子就干了法律这一行来照顾我。他一点一点地积攒，买了这套阔气又漂亮的房子。你刚才说什么来着，你知道，”老人又一次大笑起来，接着说道，“我说的是‘当然不是，你是对的’。”","“—Yes, hard of hearing; having that infirmity coming upon me, my son he went into the Law, and he took charge of me, and he by little and little made out this elegant and beautiful property.But returning to what you said, you know,” pursued the old man, again laughing heartily, “what I say is, No to be sure; you’re right.”"
"我审慎地想着，我无意中说的话竟让他这么高兴，那我费尽心思搜罗出的话不知能否让他的高兴程度相当于现在的一半。正在这时，烟囱一边的墙上突然传来一阵啪嗒声，一块写着“约翰”的小木板鬼使神差般地翻滚着打开了。老人顺着我的眼睛看去，得意洋洋地喊着：“我儿子回来了！”我们一起出了门，朝吊桥走去。","I was modestly wondering whether my utmost ingenuity would have enabled me to say anything that would have amused him half as much as this imaginary pleasantry, when I was startled by a sudden click in the wall on one side of the chimney, and the ghostly tumbling open of a little wooden flap with “JOHN” upon it.The old man, following my eyes, cried with great triumph, “My son’s come home!” and we both went out to the drawbridge."
"温米克从护城河的另一边向我挥手致意，这场面可是花多少钱也买不到的，我们本可以毫不费力地过河握手的。老人对操作吊桥乐此不疲，所以我没有提出要帮他，只是安安静静地站在一旁，直到温米克过了桥，把我介绍给司琪芬小姐：司琪芬小姐是和他一起来的。","It was worth any money to see Wemmick waving a salute to me from the other side of the moat, when we might have shaken hands across it with the greatest ease.The Aged was so delighted to work the drawbridge, that I made no offer to assist him, but stood quiet until Wemmick had come across, and had presented me to Miss Skiffins: a lady by whom he was accompanied."
"司琪芬小姐表情木然，跟她的护送人一样，她也是在邮政部门工作的。她可能比温米克年轻两三岁，我估计她拥有一笔数目可观的动产。无论从前面还是从后面看，她衣服腰部以上的剪裁都让她的身段看上去像男孩子玩的风筝。我恐怕得说，她衣服的橘红色红得有点过头，她的绿手套也绿得有点过头。但她看起来是个好人，对老人非常敬重。没多久我就发现她是这座宅子的常客。我们一进来，我就夸温米克跟老人报告回家的发明独具匠心，而他要我等一会儿注意烟囱的另一边，然后就不见了。不一会儿，又传来一阵啪嗒声，另一扇小门翻滚着打开了，门上写着“司琪芬小姐”。然后司琪芬小姐的门关上了，约翰的门翻滚着打开了，然后司琪芬小姐和约翰的门一起翻滚着打开了，最后一起关上了。温米克操作完这些机械装置后回来了，我对他这一发明表达了万分钦佩之意，他说：“你知道，这对老人家来说既有趣又实用。对了，先生，有一点不得不提。到这幢大门来的所有人当中，这些拉动装置的秘密只有老人、司琪芬小姐和我知道！”","Miss Skiffins was of a wooden appearance, and was, like her escort, in the post-office branch of the service.She might have been some two or three years younger than Wemmick, and I judged her to stand possessed of portable property.The cut of her dress from the waist upward, both before and behind, made her figure very like a boy’s kite; and I might have pronounced her gown a little too decidedly orange, and her gloves a little too intensely green.But she seemed to be a good sort of fellow, and showed a high regard for the Aged.I was not long in discovering that she was a frequent visitor at the Castle; for, on our going in, and my complimenting Wemmick on his ingenious contrivance for announcing himself to the Aged, he begged me to give my attention for a moment to the other side of the chimney, and disappeared.Presently another click came, and another little door tumbled open with “Miss Skiffins” on it; then Miss Skiffins shut up and John tumbled open; then Miss Skiffins and John both tumbled open together, and finally shut up together.On Wemmick’s return from working these mechanical appliances, I expressed the great admiration with which I regarded them, and he said,“Well, you know, they’re both pleasant and useful to the Aged.And by George, sir, it’s a thing worth mentioning, that of all the people who come to this gate, the secret of those pulls is only known to the Aged, Miss Skiffins, and me!”"
"“这是温米克先生做的。”司琪芬小姐补充说，“他自己想出来，自己做出来的。”","“And Mr. Wemmick made them,” added Miss Skiffins, “with his own hands out of his own head.”"
"司琪芬小姐整晚都戴着她那副绿手套，（这是一种可见的外在标志，表示有客人在。）她脱下帽子的时候，温米克邀我绕宅子转一圈，看一看冬天的小岛是什么样子的。我想他这么做是想给我一个机会，让我知道他在沃尔沃思的想法。我们一走出宅子，我便抓住了这个机会。","While Miss Skiffins was taking off her bonnet (she retained her green gloves during the evening as an outward and visible sign that there was company), Wemmick invited me to take a walk with him round the property, and see how the island looked in wintertime.Thinking that he did this to give me an opportunity of taking his Walworth sentiments, I seized the opportunity as soon as we were out of the Castle."
"我仔细想过这件事，所以在谈这个问题的时候，我表现得好像我从未对此做过暗示一样。我告诉温米克，我很担心赫伯特·鄱凯特，我还告诉他我们第一次相遇的情形，还有我们打架的场景。我知道赫伯特的家境，了解他的性格，知道他没有收入，只有依靠他父亲，但他父亲的补助不一定会到，而且说不准什么时候才能到。","Having thought of the matter with care, I approached my subject as if I had never hinted at it before.I informed Wemmick that I was anxious in behalf of Herbert Pocket, and I told him how we had first met, and how we had fought.I glanced at Herbert’s home, and at his character, and at his having no means but such as he was dependent on his father for: those, uncertain and unpunctual."
"我说，我初到伦敦时，少不更事、懵里懵懂，多亏他让我结识了他的朋友。我坦白说自己担心没能很好地回报他，要不是我和我的遗产，他也许早就做得更好了。我把郝维仙小姐远远地撇在一边不提，继续暗示说我和他在前途方面较过劲，我肯定他内心慷慨、豁达，绝不会做出什么卑鄙的猜疑、报复或预谋的行为。除了我跟温米克所说的这些原因，还因为赫伯特是我年轻的伙伴和朋友，而且我非常喜欢他，我希望我好运的光芒也能撒播一些到他身上。所以，我希望能从温米克自身的经历和对人对事的看法中得到些建议，希望他能指点我怎样最合理地用我的钱帮助赫伯特，让他有一些收入，就比如说一年一百英磅吧，让他守住希望、保持信心，再逐步给他买一些小额的股份。最后，我请求温米克，千万不要让赫伯特知道或怀疑是我在帮他，我还说，这世上我找不到第二个可以给我建议的人了。我把手放在他肩上，最后说道：“我忍不住要跟你吐露秘密，虽然我知道这一定让你觉得麻烦，但这是你的错，谁让你带我到这里来了呢。”","I alluded to the advantages I had derived in my first rawness and ignorance from his society, and I confessed that I feared I had but ill repaid them, and that he might have done better without me and my expectations.Keeping Miss Havisham in the background at a great distance, I still hinted at the possibility of my having competed with him in his prospects, and at the certainty of his possessing a generous soul, and being far above any mean distrusts, retaliations, or designs.For all these reasons (I told Wemmick), and because he was my young companion and friend, and I had a great affection for him, I wished my own good fortune to reflect some rays upon him, and therefore I sought advice from Wemmick’s experience and knowledge of men and affairs, how I could best try with my resources to help Herbert to some present income—say of a hundred a year, to keep him in good hope and heart—and gradually to buy him on to some small partnership.I begged Wemmick, in conclusion, to understand that my help must always be rendered without Herbert’s knowledge or suspicion, and that there was no one else in the world with whom I could advise.I wound up by laying my hand upon his shoulder, and saying, “I can’t help confiding in you, though I know it must be troublesome to you; but that is your fault, in having ever brought me here.”"
"温米克沉默了一小会儿，然后带着一丝惊讶说：“你知道，皮普先生，我得告诉你一件事。你真是个老好人。”","Wemmick was silent for a little while, and then said with a kind of start, “Well you know, Mr. Pip, I must tell you one thing.This is devilish good of you.”"
"“那你答应我，让我当个老好人吧。”我说。","“Say you’ll help me to be good then,” said I."
"“这个，”温米克摇着头说，“这不是我该做的交易。”","“Ecod,” replied Wemmick, shaking his head, “that’s not my trade.”"
"“这里也不是你的交易所。”我说。","“Nor is this your trading-place,” said I."
"“你说得对。”他回答说，“你这句话一针见血。皮普先生，我要好好考虑一下，我认为，你想做的事，恐怕得一点一点来。司琪芬先生（司琪芬小姐的哥哥）是会计师，同时也是代理人。我要先拜访一下他，然后再给你办这事。”","“You are right,” he returned.“You hit the nail on the head.Mr. Pip, I’ll put on my considering-cap, and I think all you want to do, may be done by degrees.Skiffins (that’s her brother) is an accountant and agent.I’ll look him up and go to work for you.”"
"“万分感谢。”","“I thank you ten thousand times.”"
"“相反，”他说，“我倒要谢谢你，虽然我们的交往严格意义上说是私下的、个人的，我还是得提一下，这回可算把我从纽盖特监狱带来的蜘蛛网清扫干净了。”","“On the contrary,” said he, “I thank you, for though we are strictly in our private and personal capacity, still it may be mentioned that there are Newgate cobwebs about, and it brushes them away.”"
"我们又谈了几句这类的话，然后回到宅子里去了，司琪芬小姐正在泡茶。烤面包的伟大任务就分配给了老人家，这位老绅士专心致志地烤着面包，我觉得他的眼睛好像都要融化在热气中了。我们要做的晚餐不是徒有虚名的，而是一顿真正的、丰盛的晚餐。老人家准备了一大堆黄油面包，把它们挂在顶层炉架上慢慢烤着。我几乎看不见他，只看见挂着的面包。司琪芬小姐泡了一大壶茶。结果后屋的猪兴奋不已，不停地叫唤着，像是在表示它也很想加入到我们当中来。","After a little further conversation to the same effect, we returned into the Castle where we found Miss Skiffins preparing tea.The responsible duty of making the toast was delegated to the Aged, and that excellent old gentleman was so intent upon it that he seemed to me in some danger of melting his eyes.It was no nominal meal that we were going to make, but a vigorous reality.The Aged prepared such a haystack of buttered toast, that I could scarcely see him over it as it simmered on an iron stand hooked on to the top-bar; while Miss Skiffins brewed such a jorum of tea, that the pig in the back premises became strongly excited, and repeatedly expressed his desire to participate in the entertainment."
"小旗已经在适当的时候降下，炮也已经在适当的时候放过，我感到这里仿佛和沃尔沃思所有其他地方都隔开了，就像护城河有三十英尺宽、三十英尺深一般。没有什么东西破坏宅子的宁静，除了约翰和司琪芬的门偶尔翻滚着打开。小门就像患了痉挛一样，我觉得不舒服，不过还是习惯了。我从司琪芬小姐井井有条的办事风格来推断，她每个星期天的晚上都去那里沏茶。她佩戴着一个古典式样的胸针，胸针上是一个不太漂亮的女人的肖像，女人的鼻子很直，旁边还有一弯新月，我很怀疑这枚胸针是温米克送给她的一件动产。","The flag had been struck, and the gun had been fired, at the right moment of time, and I felt as snugly cut off from the rest of Walworth as if the moat were thirty feet wide by as many deep.Nothing disturbed the tranquillity of the Castle, but the occasional tumbling open of John and Miss Skiffins: which little doors were a prey to some spasmodic infirmity that made me sympathetically uncomfortable until I got used to it.I inferred from the methodical nature of Miss Skiffins’ arrangements that she made tea there every Sunday night; and I rather suspected that a classic brooch she wore, representing the profile of an undesirable female with a very straight nose and a very new moon, was a piece of portable property that had been given her by Wemmick."
"我们把面包都吃光了，还喝了很多茶，看着我们个个都暖暖和和、红光满面的样子真是件令人开心的事。尤其是老人家，油光满面的，就像是某个野蛮部落里干干净净的老酋长。休息了一小会儿后，因为小女仆不在——她像是在星期日的下午回到家人的怀抱里去了——所以司琪芬小姐清洗了茶具。她的动作很业余，像贵族的小姐在干这样的活，但对我们来说这并没有什么妨碍。然后，她又戴上了手套，我们围炉而坐，温米克说：“老父亲，给我们读读报吧。”","We ate the whole of the toast, and drank tea in proportion, and it was delightful to see how warm and greasy we all got after it.The Aged especially, might have passed for some clean old chief of a savage tribe, just oiled.After a short pause for repose, Miss Skiffins—in the absence of the little servant who, it seemed, retired to the bosom of her family on Sunday afternoons—washed up the tea-things, in a trifling lady-like amateur manner that compromised none of us.Then, she put on her gloves again, and we drew round the fire, and Wemmick said, “Now Aged Parent, tip us the paper.”"
"趁着老人家掏出眼镜的空档，温米克跟我解释说，这是惯例，大声读报让老人家觉得很满足。“我不用道歉。”温米克说，“因为他能找到的乐子不多——你说是不是，老父亲？”","Wemmick explained to me while the Aged got his spectacles out, that this was according to custom, and that it gave the old gentleman infinite satisfaction to read the news aloud.“I won’t offer an apology,” said Wemmick, “for he isn’t capable of many pleasures—are you, Aged P.?”"
"“没错，约翰，没错。”老人家看见有人跟自己说话，赶忙答话。","“All right, John, all right,” returned the old man, seeing himself spoken to."
"“他目光一从报纸上移开，只要我们时不时地跟他点点头，”温米克说，“他就会跟国王一样快活。我们都在注意听呢，老父亲。”","“Only tip him a nod every now and then when he looks off his paper,” said Wemmick, “and he’ll be as happy as a king.We are all attention, Aged One.”"
"“好的，约翰，好的！”老人家兴致勃勃地答道，他繁忙又开心的样子的确十分有趣。","“All right, John, all right!” returned the cheerful old man: so busy and so pleased, that it really was quite charming."
"老人家的朗读让我想起了在沃甫赛先生的大姑婆家上课时的情形，老人家的声音好像是从钥匙孔里传出来的一样，让人觉得更加有趣了。因为他要把蜡烛放在自己身边，而且他总是险些就让脑袋或报纸碰到烛火，所以需要像看火药厂一样地看着他。但是温米克一直监视着，既没有懈怠也没有不耐烦的意思，老人家继续读着报，丝毫没有意识到他已多次获救。每当他看着我们的时候，我们就都表现出饶有兴趣、惊讶不已的样子，点点头，直到他又接着读下去。","The Aged’s reading reminded me of the classes at Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt’s, with the pleasanter peculiarity that it seemed to come through a keyhole.As he wanted the candles close to him, and as he was always on the verge of putting either his head or the newspaper into them, he required as much watching as a powder-mill.But Wemmick was equally untiring and gentle in his vigilance, and the Aged read on, quite unconscious of his many rescues.Whenever he looked at us, we all expressed the greatest interest and amazement, and nodded until he resumed again."
"温米克和司琪芬小姐并排坐着，而我坐在一个阴暗的角落。我注意到温米克先生的嘴角慢慢张开了，这充分暗示他正慢慢伸出胳膊，偷偷搂住了司琪芬小姐的腰。最后，我看见他的手出现在司琪芬小姐的另一边，但这时，司琪芬小姐麻利地用绿手套阻止了他，松开了他的胳膊，就像松开裙子上的一件饰品一样，十分从容地把他的手放在她面前的桌子上。司琪芬小姐做这个动作时十分镇定，这个动作是我见过的最令人惊讶的动作了。如果我把她这一行为当成是漫不经心做出来的话，那司琪芬小姐的这个动作一定是早已机械化了。","As Wemmick and Miss Skiffins sat side by side, and as I sat in a shadowy corner, I observed a slow and gradual elongation of Mr. Wemmick’s mouth, powerfully suggestive of his slowly and gradually stealing his arm round Miss Skiffins’ waist.In course of time I saw his hand appear on the other side of Miss Skiffins; but at that moment Miss Skiffins neatly stopped him with the green glove, unwound his arm again as if it were an article of dress, and with the greatest deliberation laid it on the table before her.Miss Skiffins’ composure while she did this was one of the most remarkable sights I have ever seen, and if I could have thought the act consistent with abstraction of mind, I should have deemed that Miss Skiffins performed it mechanically."
"不久，我发现温米克的胳膊又开始不见了，渐渐地从视野里消失了。不一会，他的嘴又开始张开了。在这一间隔中，我的心中悬念顿生，这种悬念既吸引人又折磨人。之后，我看见他的手出现在司琪芬小姐的另一边。司琪芬小姐立刻像一个一脸平静的拳击手那样阻止了他的手。她平静地取下腰带，跟刚才一样，然后把它放到桌上。假如把这张桌子当成美德之路，我有理由说，在老人家读报的整个期间，温米克的胳膊从美德之路上迷了路，是司琪芬小姐把他召唤回到了美德之路上。","By-and-by, I noticed Wemmick’s arm beginning to disappear again, and gradually fading out of view.Shortly afterwards, his mouth began to widen again.After an interval of suspense on my part that was quite enthralling and almost painful, I saw his hand appear on the other side of Miss Skiffins.Instantly, Miss Skiffins stopped it with the neatness of a placid boxer, took off that girdle or cestus as before, and laid it on the table.Taking the table to represent the path of virtue, I am justified in stating that during the whole time of the Aged’s reading, Wemmick’s arm was straying from the path of virtue and being recalled to it by Miss Skiffins."
"终于，老人家读着读着进入了梦乡。温米克拿出一把小壶，一托盘的玻璃杯，一只黑色瓶子，瓶子上有一个瓷塞，塞子上的图案是一位面色红润、温文尔雅的尊贵牧师。我们用这些茶具喝了点热的东西，老人家不久也从小憩中醒了过来，加入到我们中间来。我观察到，司琪芬小姐弄混了，她和温米克在用同一个杯子喝茶。当然，我知道有比提出送司琪芬小姐回家更好的办法，在这样的情况下，我想我最好是先走。于是，我就亲切地跟老人家告别，说我这个晚上过得很愉快。","At last, the Aged read himself into a light slumber.This was the time for Wemmick to produce a little kettle, a tray of glasses, and a black bottle with a porcelain-topped cork, representing some clerical dignitary of a rubicund and social aspect.With the aid of these appliances we all had something warm to drink: including the Aged, who was soon awake again.Miss Skiffins mixed, and I observed that she and Wemmick drank out of one glass.Of course I knew better than to offer to see Miss Skiffins home, and under the circumstances I thought I had best go first: which I did, taking a cordial leave of the Aged, and having passed a pleasant evening."
"一个星期不到，我就收到了一封温米克寄来的信，信是从沃尔沃思寄来的。信上写着他希望我们私下以个人名义办的事有了进展，如果我能就此事再去见他一次，他会很高兴。所以我第二次去了沃尔沃思，然后去了第三次、第四次，我还如约在伦敦金融城里见了他几次，但从未和他在小不列颠街附近谈过这个话题。结果就是，我们找到了一个值得信赖的年轻商人，或者说船运经纪人。这人从商还不久，需要业务上的指点，也需要资金。在时机恰当、款项到位的情况下，他就会想要找一个合伙人。我跟他围绕着赫伯特的主题，签订了秘密条款。我从五百英镑中付给了他二百五十英镑，还牵涉到其他杂七杂八的费用，其中一些在预定日期从我的收入中扣除，另外一些等我得到了遗产之后再付。司琪芬小姐的哥哥主持了这一谈判。这事温米克从头到尾都参与了，但他从未出面。","Before a week was out, I received a note from Wemmick, dated Walworth, stating that he hoped he had made some advance in that matter appertaining to our private and personal capacities, and that he would be glad if I could come and see him again upon it.So, I went out to Walworth again, and yet again, and yet again, and I saw him by appointment in the City several times, but never held any communication with him on the subject in or near Little Britain.The upshot was, that we found a worthy young merchant or shipping-broker, not long established in business, who wanted intelligent help, and who wanted capital, and who in due course of time and receipt would want a partner.Between him and me, secret articles were signed of which Herbert was the subject, and I paid him half of my five hundred pounds down, and engaged for sundry other payments: some, to fall due at certain dates out of my income: some, contingent on my coming into my property.Miss Skiffins’ brother conducted the negotiation.Wemmick pervaded it throughout, but never appeared in it."
"整个交易处理得如此巧妙，赫伯特一点都没有怀疑我会参与其中。我永远不会忘记那个下午，他红光满面地回到家，告诉我一个特大消息，说他见了一个叫克拉利克的人（那个年轻商人的名字），那个克拉利克对他非常好，他相信他总算时来运转了。他的希望一天比一天更强烈，脸上也一天比一天更有光彩，他一定越来越把我当做他的挚友，因为我看见他这么开心，我也抑制不住开心的泪水。终于，一切都办妥之后，他在那天走进了克拉利克的交易所。他整晚都兴致勃勃、开心不已地跟我谈话，我上床后，想到我的遗产给别人做了点好事，我真的痛痛快快地哭了。","The whole business was so cleverly managed, that Herbert had not the least suspicion of my hand being in it.I never shall forget the radiant face with which he came home one afternoon, and told me, as a mighty piece of news, of his having fallen in with one Clarriker (the young merchant’s name), and of Clarriker’s having shown an extraordinary inclination towards him, and of his belief that the opening had come at last.Day by day as his hopes grew stronger and his face brighter, he must have thought me a more and more affectionate friend, for I had the greatest difficulty in restraining my tears of triumph when I saw him so happy.At length, the thing being done, and he having that day entered Clarriker’s House, and he having talked to me for a whole evening in a flush of pleasure and success, I did really cry in good earnest when I went to bed, to think that my expectations had done some good to somebody."
"我生命中的一件大事，我人生的转折点，现在在我眼前展开了。但是，在我继续讲下去之前，在我讲述它所涉及的所有改变之前，我得用一个章节来谈谈埃斯特拉。对于这样一个一直以来都占据着我的心灵的主题，一个章节不算多。","A great event in my life, the turning point of my life, now opens on my view.But, before I proceed to narrate it, and before I pass on to all the changes it involved, I must give one chapter to Estella.It is not much to give to the theme that so long filled my heart."
"第三十八章","Chapter 38"
"如果我死后，里士满草地旁边那所古板的老房子会闹鬼的话，那一定是我的鬼魂在出没。埃斯特拉住在那里的时候，我身体里那不安定的灵魂，在那里游荡了多少个日日夜夜啊！不管我的身体在哪里，我的灵魂却始终围绕着那所房子一而再、再而三地游荡。","If that staid old house near the Green at Richmond should ever come to be haunted when I am dead, it will be haunted, surely, by my ghost.O the many, many nights and days through which the unquiet spirit within me haunted that house when Estella lived there!Let my body be where it would, my spirit was always wandering, wandering, wandering, about that house."
"跟埃斯特拉住在一起的夫人名叫布兰德利，是个寡妇，有一个比埃斯特拉大几岁的女儿。母亲显得年轻，女儿显得老成；母亲面色红润，女儿面色发黄；母亲举止轻浮，女儿笃信宗教。她们家门第很高。她们经常外出访友，也常有客人上门拜访。她们和埃斯特拉之间几乎没有共同语言，即使有，也少得可怜。但她们之间有一个共识，那就是，她们离不开埃斯特拉，埃斯特拉也离不开她们。郝维仙小姐在隐居以前和布兰德利夫人是朋友。","The lady with whom Estella was placed, Mrs. Brandley by name, was a widow, with one daughter several years older than Estella.The mother looked young, and the daughter looked old; the mother’s complexion was pink, and the daughter’s was yellow; the mother set up for frivolity, and the daughter for theology.They were in what is called a good position, and visited, and were visited by, numbers of people.Little, if any, community of feeling subsisted between them and Estella, but the understanding was established that they were necessary to her, and that she was necessary to them.Mrs. Brandley had been a friend of Miss Havisham’s before the time of her seclusion."
"无论是在布兰德利夫人家里，还是在外面，我都要忍受埃斯特拉给我的各种各样、不同程度的折磨。我和她之间的关系只是熟识，但还没有到喜欢的层面，这使我心烦意乱。她利用我来戏弄她的那些爱慕者，我和她之间的这种亲密关系，成了她一直以来蔑视我对她一片衷心的把柄。如果我是她的秘书、管家、同父异母或同母异父的兄弟、穷亲戚，如果我是她未婚夫的弟弟，我都不会像现在这样——和她的关系越亲密，我的希望就越渺茫。我有直呼她名字的特权，也有听她直呼我名字的特权，但在这种情况下，这也只能加重我的痛苦。虽然我认为这可能要让她的那些爱慕者发狂，但我也十分清楚，这也几乎快要让我发狂了。","In Mrs. Brandley’s house and out of Mrs. Brandley’s house, I suffered every kind and degree of torture that Estella could cause me.The nature of my relations with her, which placed me on terms of familiarity without placing me on terms of favor, conduced to my distraction.She made use of me to tease other admirers, and she turned the very familiarity between herself and me, to the account of putting a constant slight on my devotion to her.If I had been her secretary, steward, half-brother, poor relation—if I had been a younger brother of her appointed husband—I could not have seemed to myself, further from my hopes when I was nearest to her.The privilege of calling her by her name and hearing her call me by mine, became under the circumstances an aggravation of my trials; and while I think it likely that it almost maddened her other lovers, I know too certainly that it almost maddened me."
"她的爱慕者络绎不绝。毫无疑问，我的嫉妒心让我把每一个走近她的人都看成是她的爱慕者，但即使除去这些人，她的爱慕者还是不计其数。","She had admirers without end.No doubt my jealousy made an admirer of every one who went near her; but there were more than enough of them without that."
"我常常去里士满看她，常常在镇上听人们说到她，也常常带她和布兰德利母女去水上泛舟、野餐、参加游乐会、看戏、听歌剧、欣赏音乐会、参加聚会。在一切游乐活动中，我都在追求她——所有这些对我来说都是痛苦。在她参与社交活动的时候，我没有一刻是快乐的，但我一天二十四小时满脑子都在想，要是能和她共度一生，该有多幸福啊。","I saw her often at Richmond, I heard of her often in town, and I used often to take her and the Brandleys on the water; there were picnics, fete days, plays, operas, concerts, parties, all sorts of pleasures, through which I pursued her—and they were all miseries to me.I never had one hour’s happiness in her society, and yet my mind all round the four-and-twenty hours was harping on the happiness of having her with me unto death."
"在我们交往的这段时间里（从下文可以看出，我那时觉得很漫长），她总是习惯性地用那种语气跟我说话，表明我们的交往是被逼的。有时，她会突然止住这种语气，还有她惯用的其他各种语气，似乎对我动了怜悯之心。","Throughout this part of our intercourse—and it lasted, as will presently be seen, for what I then thought a long time—she habitually reverted to that tone which expressed that our association was forced upon us.There were other times when she would come to a sudden check in this tone and in all her many tones, and would seem to pity me."
"一天晚上，在里士满那所房子的一扇窗户下，我们分开而坐，暮色正在降临，她突然止住了那种语气，对我说：“皮普，皮普，你怎么就不当心点呢？”","“Pip, Pip,” she said one evening, coming to such a check, when we sat apart at a darkening window of the house in Richmond; “will you never take warning?”"
"“当心什么？”","“Of what?”"
"“当心我。”","“Of me.”"
"“你的意思是，当心不要被你引诱，埃斯特拉？”","“Warning not to be attracted by you, do you mean, Estella?”"
"“我的意思！如果你不知道我什么意思，你就是睁眼瞎。”","“Do I mean!If you don’t know what I mean, you are blind.”"
"我本该反驳她说，都说爱情是盲目的，但由于我总是受某种想法的牵制——这给我带来的痛苦还真不小——因为她知道她除了听从郝维仙小姐之外别无选择，所以我认为我这样强迫她是不厚道的。我一直担心的是，她对此十分清楚，而且生性高傲，这使我处于一种十分不利的地位，使我成了她打心眼里想要反抗的目标。","I should have replied that Love was commonly reputed blind, but for the reason that I always was restrained—and this was not the least of my miseries—by a feeling that it was ungenerous to press myself upon her, when she knew that she could not choose but obey Miss Havisham.My dread always was, that this knowledge on her part laid me under a heavy disadvantage with her pride, and made me the subject of a rebellious struggle in her bosom."
"“不管怎样，”我说，“我目前还没有听说有什么要当心的，因为这次是你写信让我来的。”","“At any rate,” said I, “I have no warning given me just now, for you wrote to me to come to you, this time.”"
"“是这样的。”埃斯特拉说，同时露出冷淡而漫不经心的笑容，这样的笑总是让我感到心寒。","“That’s true,” said Estella, with a cold careless smile that always chilled me."
"她看了看外面的暮色，接着说：","After looking at the twilight without, for a little while, she went on to say:"
"“郝维仙小姐要我去沙提斯庄园看望她的日子又要来了。如果你愿意的话，可以送我过去，再送我回来。她不想我一个人去，又不欢迎我的女仆，因为跟这样的人说话，让她觉得很反感。你可以送我去吗？”","“The time has come round when Miss Havisham wishes to have me for a day at Satis.You are to take me there, and bring me back, if you will.She would rather I did not travel alone, and objects to receiving my maid, for she has a sensitive horror of being talked of by such people.Can you take me?”"
"“我可以吗？埃斯特拉！”","“Can I take you, Estella!”"
"“那么你是接受了？后天，要是你方便的话。费用都从我的钱包里拿，这是你跟我去的条件，知道了吗？”","“You can then?The day after tomorrow, if you please.You are to pay all charges out of my purse, You hear the condition of your going?”"
"“一定遵守。”我说。","“And must obey,” said I."
"这就是我为那次探访做的所有准备，以后几次也是一样。郝维仙小姐从未给我写过信，我甚至从未见过她的字迹。第三天我们到了沙提斯，在我第一次见她的那间屋子里见到了她，不用说，沙提斯老宅还是老样子。","This was all the preparation I received for that visit, or for others like it: Miss Havisham never wrote to me, nor had I ever so much as seen her handwriting.We went down on the next day but one, and we found her in the room where I had first beheld her, and it is needless to add that there was no change in Satis House."
"她对埃斯特拉的喜欢更加令人害怕了，比上一次我见她俩一起时更甚。我有意重复“令人害怕”这个字眼，因为从她的神情和她拥抱埃斯特拉的方式中，我觉察出一丝可怕之处。她对艾斯特拉的美貌、对她的言谈、对她的仪态，都像幽灵一样缠住不放，坐在那里一边看着她，一边咬着自己颤抖的手指，好像要把这个亲手养育大的美人吞下去。","She was even more dreadfully fond of Estella than she had been when I last saw them together; I repeat the word advisedly, for there was something positively dreadful in the energy of her looks and embraces.She hung upon Estella’s beauty, hung upon her words, hung upon her gestures, and sat mumbling her own trembling fingers while she looked at her, as though she were devouring the beautiful creature she had reared."
"她把目光从埃斯特拉身上移向了我，她那犀利的目光似乎要伸入我的心，探一探我心里的伤口。“她是怎么利用你的，皮普，她是怎么利用你的？”她又问了我一次，急切的样子好似女巫一般，甚至连埃斯特拉就在身旁也顾不上了。晚上，我们坐在闪烁不定的炉火旁，她的样子极其神秘可怕。她拉过埃斯特拉的手，放在自己的手臂下，然后紧紧抓住她的手，硬要埃斯特拉跟她谈谈她在信中提到的事，说说那些被她迷得神魂颠倒的男人叫什么名字，是什么身份。郝维仙小姐带着一种受过严重创伤的病态的心理玩味着这份名单。她坐在那里，用另一只手扶着弯曲的手杖，下巴靠在手上，用她那双苍白而明亮的眼睛盯着我，活脱脱一个幽灵。","From Estella she looked at me, with a searching glance that seemed to pry into my heart and probe its wounds.“How does she use you, Pip; how does she use you?” she asked me again, with her witch-like eagerness, even in Estella’s hearing.But, when we sat by her flickering fire at night, she was most weird; for then, keeping Estella’s hand drawn through her arm and clutched in her own hand, she extorted from her, by dint of referring back to what Estella had told her in her regular letters, the names and conditions of the men whom she had fascinated; and as Miss Havisham dwelt upon this roll, with the intensity of a mind mortally hurt and diseased, she sat with her other hand on her crutch stick, and her chin on that, and her wan bright eyes glaring at me, a very specter."
"我从中看清楚了，虽然这使我沮丧，我有一种寄人篱下的感觉，甚至堕落感，这让我痛苦不堪——我却从中看清楚了，埃斯特拉是郝维仙小姐用来报复男人的工具，在她得到满足之前，是不会把埃斯特拉许配给我的。我看清楚了，她事先把埃斯特拉许配给我的原因何在。郝维仙小姐派她出去引诱男人、折磨男人、做恶作剧，但她居心的恶意之处在于，她确保没有哪个爱慕者可以得到她，那些敢于冒险尝试的人是注定要失败的。我看清楚了，我自己也受到她这一变态计谋的折磨，即使这个奖赏是为我保留的。我看清楚了我一直以来得不到她的原因，也看清楚了我的监护人不告诉我这一计谋的原因。总之，我看清楚了，此时此地我眼前的郝维仙小姐的真实面目，以及她在我眼前一贯的真实面目，我看清楚了，在这座黑暗、肮脏的房子的阴影里，她过着暗无天日的生活。","I saw in this, wretched though it made me, and bitter the sense of dependence and even of degradation that it awakened—I saw in this, that Estella was set to wreak Miss Havisham’s revenge on men, and that she was not to be given to me until she had gratified it for a term.I saw in this, a reason for her being beforehand assigned to me.Sending her out to attract and torment and do mischief, Miss Havisham sent her with the malicious assurance that she was beyond the reach of all admirers, and that all who staked upon that cast were secured to lose.I saw in this, that I, too, was tormented by a perversion of ingenuity, even while the prize was reserved for me.I saw in this, the reason for my being staved off so long, and the reason for my late guardian’s declining to commit himself to the formal knowledge of such a scheme.In a word, I saw in this, Miss Havisham as I had her then and there before my eyes, and always had had her before my eyes; and I saw in this, the distinct shadow of the darkened and unhealthy house in which her life was hidden from the sun."
"照亮她那间屋子的蜡烛放在墙上的壁炉台上。它们离地面很高，燃烧时发出呆滞的光，屋里的空气几乎没有更新过。我环顾了一下这些蜡烛，烛光照耀出一种苍白而阴郁的氛围，那停摆的钟，那桌上和地上破旧的新娘服上的装饰物，还有她被烛光拉长了的、可怕的身影——它投射到天花板和墙面上，有如鬼魂一般——我目光所及之物都是在我脑中构想过、反复出现过、又回到我的脑海中去的。我想到了楼梯平台对面的那个大房间，那里摆着长桌子，我看见蜘蛛网从桌子中央饰品上落下，蜘蛛在桌布上爬来爬去，老鼠在壁板后心惊肉跳地展开活动，甲壳虫在地板上爬爬停停。","The candles that lighted that room of hers were placed in sconces on the wall.They were high from the ground, and they burnt with the steady dulness of artificial light in air that is seldom renewed.As I looked round at them, and at the pale gloom they made, and at the stopped clock, and at the withered articles of bridal dress upon the table and the ground, and at her own awful figure with its ghostly reflection thrown large by the fire upon the ceiling and the wall, I saw in everything the construction that my mind had come to, repeated and thrown back to me.My thoughts passed into the great room across the landing where the table was spread, and I saw it written, as it were, in the falls of the cobwebs from the centre-piece, in the crawlings of the spiders on the cloth, in the tracks of the mice as they betook their little quickened hearts behind the panels, and in the gropings and pausings of the beetles on the floor."
"我们这次拜访期间，埃斯特拉和郝维仙小姐之间有了激烈的言语上的冲突。这是我第一次看见她们起冲突。","It happened on the occasion of this visit that some sharp words arose between Estella and Miss Havisham.It was the first time I had ever seen them opposed."
"我们围炉而坐，像之前描述的那样，郝维仙小姐仍旧拉着埃斯特拉的胳膊，在自己的胳膊上擦着，仍旧紧紧抓着埃斯特拉的手，而埃斯特拉渐渐想要挣脱。她表现得有些不耐烦，还带着些傲慢，比以前更甚，与其说她在接受或回报这种热烈的情感，不如说是在忍耐。","We were seated by the fire, as just now described, and Miss Havisham still had Estella’s arm drawn through her own, and still clutched Estella’s hand in hers, when Estella gradually began to detach herself.She had shown a proud impatience more than once before, and had rather endured that fierce affection than accepted or returned it."
"“怎么！”郝维仙小姐把目光投向了埃斯特拉，说，“你对我厌烦了吗？”","“What!” said Miss Havisham, flashing her eyes upon her, “are you tired of me?”"
"“只是有点厌烦我自己。”埃斯特拉一边答道，一边挣开自己的胳膊，走到壁炉架前，站在那里低头看着炉火。","“Only a little tired of myself,” replied Estella, disengaging her arm, and moving to the great chimney-piece, where she stood looking down at the fire."
"“说实话，你这个忘恩负义的东西！”郝维仙小姐喊着，同时用手杖猛敲地面，“你对我厌烦了。”","“Speak the truth, you ingrate!” cried Miss Havisham, passionately striking her stick upon the floor; “you are tired of me.”"
"埃斯特拉十分镇定地看着她，然后又低头看着炉火。她优雅的身段和美丽的脸庞表现出了一种沉着。面对对方那种几近严酷的狂暴，她只是淡然视之。","Estella looked at her with perfect composure, and again looked down at the fire.Her graceful figure and her beautiful face expressed a self-possessed indifference to the wild heat of the other, that was almost cruel."
"“你这个木头、这个石头！”郝维仙小姐叫喊着，“你这个冷血动物！”","“You stock and stone!” exclaimed Miss Havisham.“You cold, cold heart!”"
"“什么？”埃斯特拉靠着壁炉架，仍旧是一副冷漠的样子，只是动了动眼睛，“您骂我冷血？是吗？”","“What?” said Estella, preserving her attitude of indifference as she leaned against the great chimney-piece and only moving her eyes; “do you reproach me for being cold?You?”"
"“您不是吗？”郝维仙小姐猛烈地反驳了她。","“Are you not?” was the fierce retort."
"“您该知道，”埃斯特拉说，“我怎么样都是您一手塑造的。对我的赞扬、我的责备、我的成功、我的失败，总之，我的一切都是您一手塑造的。”","“You should know,” said Estella.“I am what you have made me.Take all the praise, take all the blame; take all the success, take all the failure; in short, take me.”"
"“啊，你瞧她，你瞧她！”郝维仙小姐痛苦地喊了起来，“你瞧她，这么狠心、这么无情，这可是把她养大的家啊！在我心受重创、心口滴血的时候，我把她抱在怀里，花了这么多年来疼她！”","“O, look at her, look at her!” cried Miss Havisham, bitterly; “Look at her, so hard and thankless, on the hearth where she was reared!Where I took her into this wretched breast when it was first bleeding from its stabs, and where I have lavished years of tenderness upon her!”"
"“至少，您当初领养我这事跟我无关。”埃斯特拉说，“就算那时我能走路、会说话，我会的也只有这些。但您要的是什么呢？您对我很好，我的一切都是您给的。您要的是什么呢？”","“At least I was no party to the compact,” said Estella, “for if I could walk and speak, when it was made, it was as much as I could do.But what would you have?You have been very good to me, and I owe everything to you.What would you have?”"
"“我要的是爱。”对方答道。","“Love,” replied the other."
"“您已经得到了。”","“You have it.”"
"“我没有。”郝维仙小姐说。","“I have not,” said Miss Havisham."
"“养母，”埃斯特拉依然保持着平和的风度，没有像对方那样提高嗓门，也没有时而勃然大怒，时而温情脉脉，“养母，我说了,我的一切都是您给的。我拥有的一切您都可以自由处置。您给我的一切，您都可以收回，再次归您所有。除此以外，我一无所有。至于您没有给过我的东西，如果您问我要，那么无论是情理上，还是义务上，我都没法做出不可能的事情。”","“Mother by adoption,” retorted Estella, never departing from the easy grace of her attitude, never raising her voice as the other did, never yielding either to anger or tenderness, “Mother by adoption, I have said that I owe everything to you.All I possess is freely yours.All that you have given me, is at your command to have again.Beyond that, I have nothing.And if you ask me to give you what you never gave me, my gratitude and duty cannot do impossibilities.”"
"“难道我从未给过她爱！”郝维仙小姐猛地转向我，喊道，“难道我从未给过她炽热的爱，我给她的爱一向到了让人嫉妒、让人心疼的地步，她竟然对我说这样的话！让她叫我疯子好了，让她叫我疯子好了！”","“Did I never give her love!” cried Miss Havisham, turning wildly to me.“Did I never give her a burning love, inseparable from jealousy at all times, and from sharp pain, while she speaks thus to me!Let her call me mad, let her call me mad!”"
"“我为什么要叫您疯子，”埃斯特拉说，“在所有人当中，为什么是我叫您疯子？对于您处心积虑的事情，世上还有谁有我了解的一半那么多？对于您刻骨铭心的记忆，世上还有谁有我了解的一半那么多？我就坐在这个壁炉边的一张小凳子上，这张凳子现在还在您旁边放着呢，我听从您的教导，我抬头看着您的脸，那张脸当时真让我又惊讶又害怕！”","“Why should I call you mad,” returned Estella, “I, of all people?Does any one live, who knows what set purposes you have, half as well as I do?Does any one live, who knows what a steady memory you have, half as well as I do?I who have sat on this same hearth on the little stool that is even now beside you there, learning your lessons and looking up into your face, when your face was strange and frightened me!”"
"“早就忘了！”郝维仙小姐呻吟着，“早就忘了！”","“Soon forgotten!” moaned Miss Havisham.“Times soon forgotten!”"
"“不，没有忘。”埃斯特拉反驳道，“没有忘，珍藏在我记忆中了。您几时发现我不听从您的教导了？您几时发现我对您的教导漫不经心了？您几时发现我这里，”她把手放在胸口，“想着您不允许做的事情了？您该公正地对我。”","“No, not forgotten,” retorted Estella.“Not forgotten, but treasured up in my memory.When have you found me false to your teaching?When have you found me unmindful of your lessons?When have you found me giving admission here,” she touched her bosom with her hand, “to anything that you excluded?Be just to me.”"
"“太傲慢了，太傲慢了！”郝维仙小姐呻吟着，双手撩着散开的灰白头发。","“So proud, so proud!” moaned Miss Havisham, pushing away her grey hair with both her hands."
"“是谁教会我傲慢的？”埃斯特拉反驳道，“在我学会了傲慢时，是谁夸奖我的？”","“Who taught me to be proud?” returned Estella.“Who praised me when I learnt my lesson?”"
"“太狠心了，太狠心了！”郝维仙呻吟着，像刚才那样撩着散开的灰白头发。","“So hard, so hard!” moaned Miss Havisham, with her former action."
"“是谁教会我狠心的？”埃斯特拉反驳道，“在我学会了狠心时，是谁夸奖我的？”","“Who taught me to be hard?” returned Estella.“Who praised me when I learnt my lesson?”"
"“对我傲慢，对我狠心吧！”郝维仙小姐尖声叫了起来，同时伸出她的胳膊，“埃斯特拉，埃斯特拉，埃斯特拉，对我傲慢，对我狠心吧！”","“But to be proud and hard to me!” Miss Havisham quite shrieked, as she stretched out her arms.“Estella, Estella, Estella, to be proud and hard to me!”"
"埃斯特拉平静而惊讶地看了她一会，但仍然不失镇定，过了一会儿，她又低头看着炉火。","Estella looked at her for a moment with a kind of calm wonder, but was not otherwise disturbed; when the moment was past, she looked down at the fire again."
"“我不明白，”埃斯特拉沉默了一会儿之后，抬起眼来说道，“我跟您分别了一阵子后回来看您，为什么您要这么不讲道理。我从来没有忘记您所受的委屈，还有造成您所受委屈的原因。我从来没有辜负您和您对我的教导。我从来没有让自己有什么软弱的表现。”","“I cannot think,” said Estella, raising her eyes after a silence “why you should be so unreasonable when I come to see you after a separation.I have never forgotten your wrongs and their causes.I have never been unfaithful to you or your schooling.I have never shown any weakness that I can charge myself with.”"
"“回报我的爱是软弱的表现吗？”郝维仙喊道，“是的，是的，她会说是的！”","“Would it be weakness to return my love?” exclaimed Miss Havisham.“But yes, yes, she would call it so!”"
"“我想，”埃斯特拉又露出惊讶而平静的神情，沉默了一会儿之后，她若有所思地说，“我差不多知道是怎么回事了。假如说，您让您的养女成天在这些暗无天日的屋子里长大，从来不让她知道还有日光这种东西，也从来没让她在日光下见过您的脸——如果您一开始这么做了，后来，出于某种目的，您让她接触到了日光，了解了所有关于日光的事情，您却感到失望、感到生气，对不对？”","“I begin to think,” said Estella, in a musing way, after another moment of calm wonder, “that I almost understand how this comes about.If you had brought up your adopted daughter wholly in the dark confinement of these rooms, and had never let her know that there was such a thing as the daylight by which she had never once seen your face—if you had done that, and then, for a purpose had wanted her to understand the daylight and know all about it, you would have been disappointed and angry?”"
"郝维仙小姐坐在那里，双手抱着头，发出低低的呜咽声，身子在椅子上颤抖着，但没有回答。","Miss Havisham, with her head in her hands, sat making a low moaning, and swaying herself on her chair, but gave no answer."
"“或者，”埃斯特拉说，“——打个更近乎事实的比方——假如说，您从她懂事时开始，就极尽所能地教导她，有日光这样一种东西，但这是她的宿敌和灾星，她一定得时刻反对它，因为它摧残了您，也可能会摧残她——如果您一开始是这么做的，后来，出于某种目的，想要她自然而然地接触日光，而她做不到，您就感到失望、感到生气，对不对？”","“Or,” said Estella, “—which is a nearer case—if you had taught her, from the dawn of her intelligence, with your utmost energy and might, that there was such a thing as daylight, but that it was made to be her enemy and destroyer, and she must always turn against it, for it had blighted you and would else blight her;—if you had done this, and then, for a purpose, had wanted her to take naturally to the daylight and she could not do it, you would have been disappointed and angry?”"
"郝维仙小姐坐在那里听她说话（或者看起来是在听她说话，因为我看不见她的脸），但还是没有回答。","Miss Havisham sat listening (or it seemed so, for I could not see her face), but still made no answer."
"“所以，”埃斯特拉说，“您把我塑造成了什么样子，就该怎么样对待我。成功不属于我，失败也不是我的错，但这两者加在一起，就成了我现在这样一个人。”","“So,” said Estella, “I must be taken as I have been made.The success is not mine, the failure is not mine, but the two together make me.”"
"我不知道郝维仙小姐是怎么坐到地板上去的，坐在那堆破旧不堪的新娘饰物中间。我利用这个机会——我从一开始就在等这个机会——离开了这间屋子，我走之前打了个手势，恳求埃斯特拉照看好郝维仙小姐。我走的时候，埃斯特拉仍然站在那庞大的壁炉架旁，她一直都站在那里。郝维仙小姐满头灰白的头发披散在地上，跟那些新娘饰品混在一起，这情形真叫人不忍目睹。","Miss Havisham had settled down, I hardly knew how, upon the floor, among the faded bridal relics with which it was strewn.I took advantage of the moment—I had sought one from the first—to leave the room, after beseeching Estella’s attention to her, with a movement of my hand.When I left, Estella was yet standing by the great chimney-piece, just as she had stood throughout.Miss Havisham’s grey hair was all adrift upon the ground, among the other bridal wrecks, and was a miserable sight to see."
"我怀着沮丧的心情，在星光下走了一个多钟头，庭院、酿酒作坊、荒芜的园子都走遍了。我最后鼓足勇气回到屋里，发现埃斯特拉坐在郝维仙小姐的膝下，在一件快要成为破布的衣服上缝缝补补，此后，每当我看见教堂上悬挂着的那些褪了色的旧旗帜，就会想起这件破衣服。之后，我和埃斯特拉玩起了扑克，像往日一样——只是比往日更熟练了，而且玩的是法国扑克——这个晚上就这样消磨掉了，然后我准备上床就寝。","It was with a depressed heart that I walked in the starlight for an hour and more, about the court-yard, and about the brewery, and about the ruined garden.When I at last took courage to return to the room, I found Estella sitting at Miss Havisham’s knee, taking up some stitches in one of those old articles of dress that were dropping to pieces, and of which I have often been reminded since by the faded tatters of old banners that I have seen hanging up in cathedrals.Afterwards, Estella and I played at cards, as of yore—only we were skilful now, and played French games—and so the evening wore away, and I went to bed."
"我睡在院子对面那座独立的房子里。这是我第一次在沙提斯庄园过夜，我翻来覆去，难以入眠。仿佛有千百个郝维仙小姐在我身旁萦绕。我枕头这边是她，那边也是她，床头是她，床尾也是她，她在更衣室半开着的门后面，在更衣室里面，在楼上的房间，在楼下的房间——无所不在。最后，夜已经悄悄走到了凌晨两点钟，我觉得我再也无法忍受继续在这里躺下去了，我非起来不可。因此，我起了床，穿上衣服，穿过院子，来到对面长长的石廊，想到院子外面走走，让大脑放松一下。可是，我一到走廊就熄灭了烛火，因为我看见郝维仙小姐在走廊上走着，幽灵一般，发出低低的哭泣声。我在她身后，远远地跟着她，看见她上了楼梯。她手里拿着一根光秃秃的蜡烛，可能是从她自己屋里的烛台架上随便拿了一只，烛光照得她活像一个鬼魂。我站在楼梯底部，没有看见她打开房间的门，但感到空气中有从餐室里飘来的霉味，我听见她走进了餐室，然后走回自己的房间，然后又走到餐室，一路上她低低的哭泣声始终没有停过。过了片刻，我试着从黑暗中走出来，回到自己房里去，但却办不到，直到几缕黎明的亮光照进来，我才得以辨明方向。在这整个期间，只要我走到楼梯底部，我就能听到她的脚步声，看见她的烛光在上面移动，听见她那无休止的、低低的哭泣声。","I lay in that separate building across the court-yard.It was the first time I had ever lain down to rest in Satis House, and sleep refused to come near me.A thousand Miss Havishams haunted me.She was on this side of my pillow, on that, at the head of the bed, at the foot, behind the half-opened door of the dressing-room, in the dressing-room, in the room overhead, in the room beneath—everywhere.At last, when the night was slow to creep on towards two o’clock, I felt that I absolutely could no longer bear the place as a place to lie down in, and that I must get up.I therefore got up and put on my clothes, and went out across the yard into the long stone passage, designing to gain the outer court-yard and walk there for the relief of my mind.But, I was no sooner in the passage than I extinguished my candle; for, I saw Miss Havisham going along it in a ghostly manner, making a low cry.I followed her at a distance, and saw her go up the staircase.She carried a bare candle in her hand, which she had probably taken from one of the sconces in her own room, and was a most unearthly object by its light.Standing at the bottom of the staircase, I felt the mildewed air of the feast-chamber, without seeing her open the door, and I heard her walking there, and so across into her own room, and so across again into that, never ceasing the low cry.After a time, I tried in the dark both to get out, and to go back, but I could do neither until some streaks of day strayed in and showed me where to lay my hands.During the whole interval, whenever I went to the bottom of the staircase, I heard her footstep, saw her light pass above, and heard her ceaseless low cry."
"第二天我们离开之前，她和埃斯特拉之间都没有再发生过冲突，后来我和埃斯特拉回去也没有再发生过冲突，我们一共回去了四次，如果我没记错的话。郝维仙小姐对埃斯特拉的态度也没有什么改变，即使有改变的话，我相信也只是在以往的态度上多了一些担心。","Before we left next day, there was no revival of the difference between her and Estella, nor was it ever revived on any similar occasion; and there were four similar occasions, to the best of my remembrance.Nor, did Miss Havisham’s manner towards Estella in anywise change, except that I believed it to have something like fear infused among its former characteristics."
"翻到我生命的这一页了，不提本特利·德鲁莫尔这个人是不可能的，要不然我才不愿意提他呢。","It is impossible to turn this leaf of my life, without putting Bentley Drummle’s name upon it; or I would, very gladly."
"一次“林中鸟”俱乐部召开大会，说是要增进友情。为此，大家像往常一样吵吵嚷嚷、各不相让，这时，主席让大家安静，因为德鲁莫尔先生还没有给一位女士祝酒，而按照俱乐部的严肃章程，这天正好轮到这个畜生来祝酒。酒瓶传下去的时候，我觉得他不怀好意地瞪了我一眼，但由于我们之间没有什么大的过结，我就没放在心上。直到他向大伙提议：为“埃斯特拉”干杯！这时，我才又惊又气。","On a certain occasion when the Finches were assembled in force, and when good feeling was being promoted in the usual manner by nobody’s agreeing with anybody else, the presiding Finch called the Grove to order, forasmuch as Mr. Drummle had not yet toasted a lady; which, according to the solemn constitution of the society, it was the brute’s turn to do that day.I thought I saw him leer in an ugly way at me while the decanters were going round, but as there was no love lost between us, that might easily be.What was my indignant surprise when he called upon the company to pledge him to “Estella!”"
"“哪个埃斯特拉？”我问。","“Estella who?” said I."
"“不关你的事。”德鲁莫尔反驳道。","“Never you mind,” retorted Drummle."
"“哪里的埃斯特拉？”我问，“你得说清楚，哪里的埃斯特拉。”作为“林中鸟”俱乐部的一员，他必须说清楚。","“Estella of where?” said I.“You are bound to say of where.”Which he was, as a Finch."
"“里士满的埃斯特拉，先生们。”德鲁莫尔说，故意不理睬我，“一位举世无双的美人。”","“Of Richmond, gentlemen,” said Drummle, putting me out of the question, “and a peerless beauty.”"
"好像他知道很多举世无双的美人一样，这个卑鄙、下流的白痴！我在赫伯特耳边说道。","Much he knew about peerless beauties, a mean miserable idiot!I whispered Herbert."
"祝酒之后，坐在桌对面的赫伯特说：“我认识那位小姐。”","“I know that lady,” said Herbert, across the table, when the toast had been honored."
"“你认识？”德鲁莫尔说。","“Do you?” said Drummle."
"“我也认识。”我面红耳赤地附和道。","“And so do I,” I added, with a scarlet face."
"“你也认识？”德鲁莫尔说，“哦，天哪！”","“Do you?” said Drummle.“Oh, Lord!”"
"这是这个笨蛋除了摔杯子、丢盘子之外唯一能做的反驳。可是，他这句话让我气得要命，因为他的话里好像带着刺。我立刻从座位上站起来说，我只能把这看成是这只可敬的“鸟儿”厚颜无耻地飞到“林子”里面来为一位他素昧平生的小姐祝酒——我们常说加入林中鸟俱乐部是“飞鸟入林”，像议会用词一样简洁。德鲁莫尔一听这话就跳了起来，问我什么意思。于是，我给了他一个很绝的回答，我说要是他想跟我斗，我一定奉陪。","This was the only retort—except glass or crockery—that the heavy creature was capable of making; but, I became as highly incensed by it as if it had been barbed with wit, and I immediately rose in my place and said that I could not but regard it as being like the honorable Finch’s impudence to come down to that Grove—we always talked about coming down to that Grove, as a neat Parliamentary turn of expression—down to that Grove, proposing a lady of whom he knew nothing.Mr. Drummle upon this, starting up, demanded what I meant by that?Whereupon, I made him the extreme reply that I believed he knew where I was to be found."
"在一个信奉基督教的国家里，发生了这样的事情，是否可以不发生流血事件而友好地相处下去，这是“林中鸟”俱乐部会员们争论的话题。关于这个话题的争论愈演愈烈，争论期间，至少又有六位可敬的会员对另六位会员表示，要是想决斗，一定奉陪。然而，最终的决定（“林中鸟”俱乐部是令人尊敬的俱乐部）是，假如德鲁莫尔先生能从那位女士那里带来一星半点的证据来证明他有幸与那位女士相识，皮普先生作为一名绅士、一名“林中鸟”俱乐部会员，就必须为其“失态之言”道歉。证明第二天就要拿出来（以免我们的荣誉感因为耽搁而变淡）。第二天，德鲁莫尔带来了埃斯特拉的手迹——里面的措词很客气——公开承认了她有幸与德鲁莫尔先生跳过几次舞。这让我无话可说，只得为自己的“失态之言”道歉，并且收回自己先前说要决斗这一站不住脚的说法。之后，德鲁莫尔和我坐在那里相互嗤之以鼻，僵持了足足一个小时。与此同时，会员们又不分青红皂白地争论了一通，最后宣布说，会员之间大大增进了友情，而且速度惊人。","Whether it was possible in a Christian country to get on without blood, after this, was a question on which the Finches were divided.The debate upon it grew so lively, indeed, that at least six more honorable members told six more, during the discussion, that they believed they knew where they were to be found.However, it was decided at last (the Grove being a Court of Honor) that if Mr. Drummle would bring never so slight a certificate from the lady, importing that he had the honor of her acquaintance, Mr. Pip must express his regret, as a gentleman and a Finch, for “having been betrayed into a warmth which.”Next day was appointed for the production (lest our honor should take cold from delay), and next day Drummle appeared with a polite little avowal in Estella’s hand, that she had had the honor of dancing with him several times.This left me no course but to regret that I had been “betrayed into a warmth which,” and on the whole to repudiate, as untenable, the idea that I was to be found anywhere.Drummle and I then sat snorting at one another for an hour, while the Grove engaged in indiscriminate contradiction, and finally the promotion of good feeling was declared to have gone ahead at an amazing rate."
"我现在轻描淡写地说这件事，但当时对我来说，这不是件无足轻重的事。因为，想到埃斯特拉竟然对这样一个卑鄙、笨拙、阴郁、远在众人之下的傻瓜示好，我就感到苦不堪言。直到如今，我依然认为，这都要归结于我对她慷慨、无私的爱的火焰，一想到她屈身于这只猎狗，我就觉得难以接受。不管她垂青于谁，我无疑都会痛苦不堪。但假如换个高尚一点的家伙，我的痛苦在种类和程度上也会有所不同。","I tell this lightly, but it was no light thing to me.For, I cannot adequately express what pain it gave me to think that Estella should show any favor to a contemptible, clumsy, sulky booby, so very far below the average.To the present moment, I believe it to have been referable to some pure fire of generosity and disinterestedness in my love for her, that I could not endure the thought of her stooping to that hound.No doubt I should have been miserable whomsoever she had favored; but a worthier object would have caused me a different kind and degree of distress."
"我要把这件事查清楚并不难，而且我也很快就发现德鲁莫尔开始追求她了，而且她也准许他这么做。没过多久，他就对她展开了激烈的追求，我和他几乎每天都擦肩而过。他一根筋地对她穷追不舍，埃斯特拉也就听任他的追求，时而给他希望，时而让他失望，对他时而奉承讨好，时而公开贬低，时而和他似乎相知很深，时而记不起他姓甚名谁。","It was easy for me to find out, and I did soon find out, that Drummle had begun to follow her closely, and that she allowed him to do it.A little while, and he was always in pursuit of her, and he and I crossed one another every day.He held on, in a dull persistent way, and Estella held him on; now with encouragement, now with discouragement, now almost flattering him, now openly despising him, now knowing him very well, now scarcely remembering who he was."
"贾格尔斯先生叫他“蜘蛛”，他果然是只蜘蛛，惯于伺机而发，他这个种群天生就有耐心。此外，他对他的钱财和家族地位像个傻瓜一样自信，这有时甚至比他的注意力和明确的目标更有用。所以，这只死守着埃斯特拉的蜘蛛，守候的时间比其他智商高于他的昆虫都要久，还时不时地离开蜘蛛网，在合适的时机出击一把。","The Spider, as Mr. Jaggers had called him, was used to lying in wait, however, and had the patience of his tribe.Added to that, he had a blockhead confidence in his money and in his family greatness, which sometimes did him good service—almost taking the place of concentration and determined purpose.So, the Spider, doggedly watching Estella, outwatched many brighter insects, and would often uncoil himself and drop at the right nick of time."
"一次在里士满举办了一场舞会（当时在许多地方都时兴开舞会），埃斯特拉艳压群芳。而这个笨拙的德鲁莫尔在她周围转来转去，而她对他也怀着极大的耐心，我下定决心要跟她谈谈关于他的事。我抓住接下来的一个机会：她远远地坐在花丛中，打算离开，只等布兰德利夫人接她回家。我和她呆在一起，因为她们一般都是由我陪同着出入这样的场合的。","At a certain Assembly Ball at Richmond (there used to be Assembly Balls at most places then), where Estella had outshone all other beauties, this blundering Drummle so hung about her, and with so much toleration on her part, that I resolved to speak to her concerning him.I took the next opportunity: which was when she was waiting for Mrs. Brandley to take her home, and was sitting apart among some flowers, ready to go.I was with her, for I almost always accompanied them to and from such places."
"“你累了吗，埃斯特拉？”","“Are you tired, Estella?”"
"“有点，皮普。”","“Rather, Pip.”"
"“你这时应该很累。”","“You should be.”"
"“有点，我真不应该累，因为我睡前还要写封信给沙提斯庄园。”","“Say rather, I should not be; for I have my letter to Satis House to write, before I go to sleep.”"
"“描述今晚的战果？”我说，“战果当然是少得可怜，埃斯特拉。”","“Recounting tonight’s triumph?” said I.“Surely a very poor one, Estella.”"
"“你这话什么意思？我不知道哪里有什么战果。”","“What do you mean?I didn’t know there had been any.”"
"“埃斯特拉，”我说，“你看那边角落里的那个家伙，他正看着我们呢。”","“Estella,” said I, “do look at that fellow in the corner yonder, who is looking over here at us.”"
"“我为什么要看他？”埃斯特拉反驳道，没有看他，而是看着我，“那边角落里的那个家伙——用你的话说——有什么好让我看的呢？”","“Why should I look at him?” returned Estella, with her eyes on me instead.“What is there in that fellow in the corner yonder—to use your words—that I need look at?”"
"“的确，我想问你的正是这个问题。”我说，“因为他整晚都在你身边打转。”","“Indeed, that is the very question I want to ask you,” said I.“For he has been hovering about you all night.”"
"“飞蛾，还有形形色色的、丑陋的生物。”埃斯特拉朝他瞟了一眼，说，“围着点燃的蜡烛打转。蜡烛有什么办法呢？”","“Moths, and all sorts of ugly creatures,” replied Estella, with a glance towards him, “hover about a lighted candle.Can the candle help it?”"
"“没有。”我说，“可埃斯特拉也没有办法吗？”","“No,” I returned; “but cannot the Estella help it?”"
"“好吧！”她笑了一会儿后说，“也许吧。是的。随你怎么说。”","“Well!” said she, laughing, after a moment, “perhaps.Yes.Anything you like.”"
"“可是，埃斯特拉，你听我说。你竟然纵容德鲁莫尔这种为众人所鄙视的小人，这真让我难过。你知道大家都鄙视他。”","“But, Estella, do hear me speak.It makes me wretched that you should encourage a man so generally despised as Drummle.You know he is despised.”"
"“是吗？”她说。","“Well?” said she."
"“他内心和外表一样丑陋不堪。一个先天不足、卑劣、愚蠢的家伙。”","“You know he is as ungainly within, as without.A deficient, ill-tempered, lowering, stupid fellow.”"
"“是吗？”她说。","“Well?” said she."
"“他除了有几个钱，还有那本可笑的笨蛋祖宗的家谱外，就一无是处。现在你知道了吧？”","“You know he has nothing to recommend him but money, and a ridiculous roll of addle-headed predecessors; now, don’t you?”"
"“是吗？”她还是这么回答，每说一次，那双漂亮的眼睛就睁大几分。","“Well?” said she again; and each time she said it, she opened her lovely eyes the wider."
"为了防止她再说出那两个字，我抢先她一步，字正腔圆地重复了一遍：“是的！这就是我痛苦不堪的原因。”","To overcome the difficulty of getting past that monosyllable, I took it from her, and said, repeating it with emphasis, “Well!Then, that is why it makes me wretched.”"
"如果我相信她垂青于德鲁莫尔只是想让我——让我——痛苦不堪，我心里头也会好受一些，但她行事一贯如此，把我置之不顾，我没办法肯定我的想法。","Now, if I could have believed that she favored Drummle with any idea of making me—me—wretched, I should have been in better heart about it; but in that habitual way of hers, she put me so entirely out of the question, that I could believe nothing of the kind."
"“皮普，”埃斯特拉向屋子扫视了一圈，“别傻了，别受这个影响。其他人也许会受到影响，不想受都不行。这不值得讨论。”","“Pip,” said Estella, casting her glance over the room, “don’t be foolish about its effect on you.It may have its effect on others, and may be meant to have.It’s not worth discussing.”"
"“不，这值得讨论，”我说，“因为我不能容忍人家说‘她把风度和魅力都浪费在那个粗人身上了，那个最低贱之流’。”","“Yes it is,” said I, “because I cannot bear that people should say, ‘she throws away her graces and attractions on a mere boor, the lowest in the crowd.’”"
"“我可以忍受。”埃斯特拉说。","“I can bear it,” said Estella."
"“啊！埃斯特拉，别这么傲慢，这么刻板。”","“Oh! don’t be so proud, Estella, and so inflexible.”"
"“现在说我傲慢又刻板！”埃斯特拉把手一摊，说道，“刚才又责怪我垂青于一个粗人！”","“Calls me proud and inflexible in this breath!” said Estella, opening her hands.“And in his last breath reproached me for stooping to a boor!”"
"“你的确是这么做的。”我赶忙说道，“今晚我看见你对他抛媚眼，对他笑，而你对我却从来没有这么做过。”","“There is no doubt you do,” said I, something hurriedly, “for I have seen you give him looks and smiles this very night, such as you never give to—me.”"
"埃斯特拉突然变了一副脸孔，即使不是生气，也是严肃而专注的：“那么，你是想要我欺骗你，让你陷入罗网吗？”","“Do you want me then,” said Estella, turning suddenly with a fixed and serious, if not angry, look, “to deceive and entrap you?”"
"“你在欺骗他，引诱他陷入罗网吗，埃斯特拉？”","“Do you deceive and entrap him, Estella?”"
"“是的，还有其他很多人——所有的人，除了你。布兰德利夫人来了。我不说了。”","“Yes, and many others—all of them but you.Here is Mrs. Brandley.I’ll say no more.”"
"我已经花了一个章节来讲这段经历，这段充斥我的心、让我的心不时隐隐作痛的经历。至此，我可以不受妨碍地接下去讲一个故事，这个故事在我心里盘踞的时间更长。在我知道这世上有个埃斯特拉，在她幼小的智慧开始接受郝维仙小姐的魔掌控制之前，这个故事就已有了雏形。","And now that I have given the one chapter to the theme that so filled my heart, and so often made it ache and ache again, I pass on, unhindered, to the event that had impended over me longer yet; the event that had begun to be prepared for, before I knew that the world held Estella, and in the days when her baby intelligence was receiving its first distortions from Miss Havisham’s wasting hands."
"东方有个故事，说苏丹打算在征战胜利后，用一块厚石板砸碎敌国国王的宝座。人们在采石场慢慢凿出这块石板，再从岩石中慢慢掘出一条隧道，用绳子穿入隧道拴住石板，然后慢慢把石板吊上屋顶装好，吊住石板的绳子另一端扣在数英里之外的一个巨大铁环上。费了九牛二虎之力，一切准备就绪，时机到了，人们在夜深人静的时候唤醒苏丹，把切断扣在巨大铁环上的绳子的利斧交到他手里。他一斧头砍下去，绳子立刻断裂，石板直坠而下，天花板瞬间崩塌。我的情形也是如此。一切远的、近的准备工作都已接近尾声，安排就绪，只等利斧一砍，我堡垒的屋顶就要坍塌下来，压在我身上。","In the Eastern story, the heavy slab that was to fall on the bed of state in the flush of conquest was slowly wrought out of the quarry, the tunnel for the rope to hold it in its place was slowly carried through the leagues of rock, the slab was slowly raised and fitted in the roof, the rope was rove to it and slowly taken through the miles of hollow to the great iron ring.All being made ready with much labor, and the hour come, the sultan was aroused in the dead of the night, and the sharpened axe that was to sever the rope from the great iron ring was put into his hand, and he struck with it, and the rope parted and rushed away, and the ceiling fell.So, in my case; all the work, near and afar, that tended to the end, had been accomplished; and in an instant the blow was struck, and the roof of my stronghold dropped upon me."
"第三十九章","Chapter 39"
"我二十三岁了。我没有听到任何关于我的财产的新消息，我的二十三岁生日也已经过去一个星期了。我们搬出巴纳德旅馆也有一年多了，现在住在坦普尔。我们的房子在花园坊，位于下游的河滨地区。","I was three-and-twenty years of age.Not another word had I heard to enlighten me on the subject of my expectations, and my twenty-third birthday was a week gone.We had left Barnard’s Inn more than a year, and lived in the Temple.Our chambers were in Garden-court, down by the river."
"鄱凯特先生和我解除最初的师生关系也有些时日了，虽然我们还保持着友好往来。尽管我还没有能力处理事务——我希望这些是由于我在理财方面的不擅长和不成熟造成的——我有看书的嗜好，每天都要花很多时间来看书。赫伯特的事情还在进行当中，而我的情况正如我在上一章的末尾所述。","Mr. Pocket and I had for some time parted company as to our original relations, though we continued on the best terms.Notwithstanding my inability to settle to anything—which I hope arose out of the restless and incomplete tenure on which I held my means—I had a taste for reading, and read regularly so many hours a day.That matter of Herbert’s was still progressing, and everything with me was as I have brought it down to the close of the last preceding chapter."
"赫伯特因公去法国马赛出差了。我孤身一人，这让我觉得索然无趣。我既沮丧又焦虑，长期以来，我一直都期待着到了明天或者下个星期自己的情况会明朗起来。长期的失望让我不禁怀念起朋友们开心的面孔和我们默契的交谈。","Business had taken Herbert on a journey to Marseilles.I was alone, and had a dull sense of being alone.Dispirited and anxious, long hoping that tomorrow or next week would clear my way, and long disappointed, I sadly missed the cheerful face and ready response of my friend."
"天气糟糕透了，总是狂风暴雨，到处都是湿漉漉的，大街小巷到处泥泞不堪。日复一日，从东边飘来一块巨大而厚重的乌云，然后继续西进，把伦敦的天空都遮住了，好像东边有取之不尽用之不竭的大风和乌云，源源不断地涌过来。狂风肆虐，城里高楼屋顶上的铅板都脱落了，在乡下，树被连根拔起，风车的叶片被风带走，沉船和死亡的不幸消息接二连三地从海边传来。狂风暴雨相互交织。在经历了心情最差的一天之后，晚上我就坐在屋里开始看书。","It was wretched weather; stormy and wet, stormy and wet; and mud, mud, mud, deep in all the streets.Day after day, a vast heavy veil had been driving over London from the East, and it drove still, as if in the East there were an Eternity of cloud and wind.So furious had been the gusts, that high buildings in town had had the lead stripped off their roofs; and in the country, trees had been torn up, and sails of windmills carried away; and gloomy accounts had come in from the coast, of shipwreck and death.Violent blasts of rain had accompanied these rages of wind, and the day just closed as I sat down to read had been the worst of all."
"自那时以来，坦普尔这一带有了一些改观，现在不像以前那么凄凉了，也不像以前那么容易被河水淹没了。我们住在最后面那栋房子的顶层。那晚，狂风吹过河面，风里夹着水汽，拍打晃动着屋子，有如大炮的袭击，又像大浪的冲击。狂风伴着大雨朝窗户打来时，我抬眼看见它们摇动着屋子，心想，我也许要把自己想象为身处一座被暴风雨袭击的灯塔中。烟囱里的烟时不时地倒灌回屋里，好像对它来说，在这样的夜晚跑出去就是无法忍受。我打开门，向下往楼梯看去，楼梯的灯已经熄灭了。我把手放在眼睛上遮住光，透过黑漆漆的窗向外望去（在这样的狂风和暴雨的夹攻下，想要打开窗，哪怕只打开一点，也是不可能的），我看见院子里的灯也被吹灭了，桥上和岸边的灯颤抖不止，河里驳船上的煤火也被风吹走了，好像红热的斑点散在雨里一般。","Alterations have been made in that part of the Temple since that time, and it has not now so lonely a character as it had then, nor is it so exposed to the river.We lived at the top of the last house, and the wind rushing up the river shook the house that night, like discharges of cannon, or breakings of a sea.When the rain came with it and dashed against the windows, I thought, raising my eyes to them as they rocked, that I might have fancied myself in a storm-beaten lighthouse.Occasionally, the smoke came rolling down the chimney as though it could not bear to go out into such a night; and when I set the doors open and looked down the staircase, the staircase lamps were blown out; and when I shaded my face with my hands and looked through the black windows (opening them ever so little, was out of the question in the teeth of such wind and rain) I saw that the lamps in the court were blown out, and that the lamps on the bridges and the shore were shuddering, and that the coal fires in barges on the river were being carried away before the wind like red-hot splashes in the rain."
"我看书的时候，表就放在桌上，打算十一点钟就合上书去睡觉。我刚合上书，圣保罗大教堂，还有伦敦金融城里所有其他教堂的钟——有的领头，有的跟着，有的随后——都敲响了十一点。钟声被风削弱了，听起来很奇怪，我一边听一边想，这风是怎么袭击钟声而把它扯得破碎不堪的，就在这时，我听到楼梯上有脚步声传来。","I read with my watch upon the table, purposing to close my book at eleven o’clock.As I shut it, Saint Paul’s, and all the many church-clocks in the City—some leading, some accompanying, some following—struck that hour.The sound was curiously flawed by the wind; and I was listening, and thinking how the wind assailed and tore it, when I heard a footstep on the stair."
"我一阵紧张而愚蠢地吃了一惊，把这脚步声和我死去的姐姐联系起来，而这阵脚步其实和她根本没有关系。脚步声停了一会儿。我再一听，只听见这个声音踉踉跄跄地越走越近。当时我记起楼梯的灯已经被风吹灭了，就拿了台灯，走到楼梯口。一切突然间静了下来，显然是楼下要上来的人看见我的灯就停住了。","What nervous folly made me start, and awfully connect it with the footstep of my dead sister, matters not.It was past in a moment, and I listened again, and heard the footstep stumble in coming on.Remembering then, that the staircase-lights were blown out, I took up my reading-lamp and went out to the stair-head.Whoever was below had stopped on seeing my lamp, for all was quiet."
"“有人在下面吗，有没有？”我喊了一声，同时向下望去。","“There is some one down there, is there not?” I called out, looking down."
"“有。”楼下的黑暗中传出一个声音。","“Yes,” said a voice from the darkness beneath."
"“你要去哪一层？”","“What floor do you want?”"
"“顶层。找皮普先生。”","“The top.Mr. Pip.”"
"“我就是皮普——不会出什么事了吧？”","“That is my name.—There is nothing the matter?”"
"“没出什么事。”那个声音答道。这个人说着就上来了。","“Nothing the matter,” returned the voice.And the man came on."
"我站在那里，把灯伸到楼梯栏杆以外，他慢慢上来了，走到灯光里来了。这是一盏带罩的台灯，是用来看书的，照射范围很有限，所以只过一会儿他就出了灯光范围。那一刻，我看见了一张陌生的脸，他抬头看着我，显得激动又高兴，他这副神情让我难以理解。","I stood with my lamp held out over the stair-rail, and he came slowly within its light.It was a shaded lamp, to shine upon a book, and its circle of light was very contracted; so that he was in it for a mere instant, and then out of it.In the instant, I had seen a face that was strange to me, looking up with an incomprehensible air of being touched and pleased by the sight of me."
"他走动着，我的灯也跟着他移动。灯光下，我看见他穿得还算体面，但不讲究，像一个从海上来的旅人。他头发很长，呈铁灰色。大概六十岁的样子。他体格强健，双腿粗壮，皮肤因为经历过风吹雨打变得黝黑而粗糙。他上了楼梯的最后一两级台阶，我手里的台灯照着我们两个，只见他张开双臂，想要拥抱我，这让我万分惊讶。","Moving the lamp as the man moved, I made out that he was substantially dressed, but roughly; like a voyager by sea.That he had long iron-grey hair.That his age was about sixty.That he was a muscular man, strong on his legs, and that he was browned and hardened by exposure to weather.As he ascended the last stair or two, and the light of my lamp included us both, I saw, with a stupid kind of amazement, that he was holding out both his hands to me."
"“请问你有什么事？”我问他。","“Pray what is your business?” I asked him."
"“我有什么事？”他重复我这句话，停顿了一下，“啊！对。我得先说明来意，请别见怪。”","“My business?” he repeated, pausing.“Ah!Yes.I will explain my business, by your leave.”"
"“你要进来吗？”","“Do you wish to come in?”"
"“是的，”他答道，“先生，我想进去。”","“Yes,” he replied; “I wish to come in, Master.”"
"我问他这个问题时十分冷淡，因为他脸上还是那幅认出我来时的开心、欣慰的表情，这让我觉得很不高兴。我不高兴是因为他这副表情好像在暗示我，他在等着我对此做出回应。但我还是把他带到了我刚才离开的那间屋子。我把台灯放在桌上，用尽量礼貌的语气，问他的来意。","I had asked him the question inhospitably enough, for I resented the sort of bright and gratified recognition that still shone in his face.I resented it, because it seemed to imply that he expected me to respond to it.But, I took him into the room I had just left, and, having set the lamp on the table, asked him as civilly as I could, to explain himself."
"他用一种奇怪的神情打量着屋子——一种带着吃惊的、喜悦的神情，好像这些让他惊叹的东西他也有份一样——他接着脱下了那件粗糙的外套，然后摘下了帽子。这时，我看见他的额上布满了皱纹，头顶是秃的，只在两侧长着铁灰色的长发。但我一点也没有看出他的来意。相反，不一会儿，我看见他又一次伸出双手想要拥抱我。","He looked about him with the strangest air—an air of wondering pleasure, as if he had some part in the things he admired—and he pulled off a rough outer coat, and his hat.Then, I saw that his head was furrowed and bald, and that the long iron-grey hair grew only on its sides.But, I saw nothing that in the least explained him.On the contrary, I saw him next moment, once more holding out both his hands to me."
"“你想干什么？”我问，我有点怀疑他是个疯子。","“What do you mean?” said I, half suspecting him to be mad."
"他之前一直看着我，现在把目光移开了，慢慢地用右手擦了擦脑袋。“真叫人失望啊，”他的嗓音很沙哑，“我走了这么远的路好不容易到了这里，但这不能怪你——我们谁都不怪。给我半分钟的时间歇一会儿，我再跟你说。请给我半分钟。”","He stopped in his looking at me, and slowly rubbed his right hand over his head.“It’s disapinting to a man,” he said, in a coarse broken voice, “arter having looked for’ard so distant, and come so fur; but you’re not to blame for that—neither on us is to blame for that.I’ll speak in half a minute.Give me half a minute, please.”"
"他在火炉前面那把椅子上坐下了，把那只青筋暴露的、黝黑的大手放在额头上。我注视着他，向后退了退，想离他远一点，但我还是不认识他。","He sat down on a chair that stood before the fire, and covered his forehead with his large brown veinous hands.I looked at him attentively then, and recoiled a little from him; but I did not know him."
"“这里没有别人，”他回头望了一眼，说，“没有吧？”","“There’s no one nigh,” said he, looking over his shoulder; “is there?”"
"“你一个陌生人，为什么在晚上这个时候到我房间里来，还问这样的问题？”我说。","“Why do you, a stranger coming into my rooms at this time of the night, ask that question?” said I."
"“你可真神气。”他摇着头对我说，故意摆出一副赞赏的表情。这种表情是那么难以理解，那么让人恼怒，“你长大了，还长得这么神气，我真高兴呀！你可不要逮我。你要是逮了我你会后悔的。”","“You’re a game one,” he returned, shaking his head at me with a deliberate affection, at once most unintelligible and most exasperating; “I’m glad you’ve grow’d up, a game one!But don’t catch hold of me.You’d be sorry arterwards to have done it.”"
"他一觉察出我的想法，我就放弃了这么做的意图，因为我认出他了！虽然他的面部特征我一个都记不起了，但我认出他了！就算风雨把悠悠岁月都冲刷掉，把横在我们面前的东西都驱散，把我们带回那个墓地，那个我们第一次一高一矮面对面站着的那个墓地，我也不会比现在更清楚地认出他来，他就坐在火炉前的那张椅子上。他不需要从口袋里掏出一把锉刀向我展示，也不需要取下他脖子上的手帕围在头上，更不需要两只胳膊紧紧抱着自己的身子，在屋里瑟瑟发抖地转来转去，还回头看我一眼，希望我能想起来。在他给我这些暗示之前我就认出他来了，虽然就在刚才，我还下意识地怀疑过他的身份呢。","I relinquished the intention he had detected, for I knew him!Even yet, I could not recall a single feature, but I knew him!If the wind and the rain had driven away the intervening years, had scattered all the intervening objects, had swept us to the churchyard where we first stood face to face on such different levels, I could not have known my convict more distinctly than I knew him now as he sat in the chair before the fire.No need to take a file from his pocket and show it to me; no need to take the handkerchief from his neck and twist it round his head; no need to hug himself with both his arms, and take a shivering turn across the room, looking back at me for recognition.I knew him before he gave me one of those aids, though, a moment before, I had not been conscious of remotely suspecting his identity."
"他走回到我站的地方，又一次向我张开了胳膊。我不知如何是好——我万分惊讶，无法镇定下来——我不情愿地把手伸给他。他一把握住我的手，把我的手放到他的唇边，亲了亲，还握着不放。","He came back to where I stood, and again held out both his hands.Not knowing what to do—for, in my astonishment I had lost my self-possession—I reluctantly gave him my hands.He grasped them heartily, raised them to his lips, kissed them, and still held them."
"“你当年的行为多高尚啊，好孩子，”他说，“高尚，皮普！我一直没忘！”","“You acted noble, my boy,” said he.“Noble, Pip!And I have never forgot it!”"
"他举止一变，好像又要来拥抱我，我伸出一只手放在他胸膛上，把他推开了。","At a change in his manner as if he were even going to embrace me, I laid a hand upon his breast and put him away."
"“别动！”我说，“离我远点！如果你因为我小时候做的事而感激我，我希望你已经以改过自新的方式，表达了对我的感谢。如果你来是为了谢我，我看没这个必要。还有，虽然你已经找到了我，你找到这里来一定是出于某种好意，我不会把你拒之门外，但你得明白，那就是——我——”","“Stay!” said I.“Keep off!If you are grateful to me for what I did when I was a little child, I hope you have shown your gratitude by mending your way of life.If you have come here to thank me, it was not necessary.Still, however you have found me out, there must be something good in the feeling that has brought you here, and I will not repulse you; but surely you must understand that—I—”"
"他用一种奇怪的眼神盯着我，我话到嘴边又咽回去了。","My attention was so attracted by the singularity of his fixed look at me, that the words died away on my tongue."
"“你是说，”我们相对无言，过了一会儿之后，他说，“我得明白。我得明白什么？”","“You was a saying,” he observed, when we had confronted one another in silence, “that surely I must understand.What, surely must I understand?”"
"“我们以前是偶然相识，但现在情况不同了，我不希望我们这种关系继续下去。我很高兴看到你已经改过自新了。我很高兴跟你说这些。我也很高兴你来谢我，让我觉得自己还值得被谢。可是，我们要走的路不一样。你都湿透了，看上去也很累。要不要喝点什么再走呢？”","“That I cannot wish to renew that chance intercourse with you of long ago, under these different circumstances.I am glad to believe you have repented and recovered yourself.I am glad to tell you so.I am glad that, thinking I deserve to be thanked, you have come to thank me.But our ways are different ways, none the less.You are wet, and you look weary.Will you drink something before you go?”"
"他松了松脖子上的围巾，站在那里，目光炯炯地盯着我，嘴里咬着那长长的围巾的一头。“我想，”他还咬着围巾的那头，还是目光炯炯地盯着我，说，“我喝点东西就走，谢谢你。”","He had replaced his neckerchief loosely, and had stood, keenly observant of me, biting a long end of it.“I think,” he answered, still with the end at his mouth and still observant of me, “that I will drink (I thank you) afore I go.”"
"茶几上放着一只托盘。我把托盘搬到火炉边的桌子上，问他想喝什么。他碰了碰一个酒瓶，既没有看是什么也没有说话，我就给他调了一杯热的朗姆酒。我调酒的时候尽量不让自己的手颤抖，但他背靠椅子看着我，嘴里还咬着他那湿透了的围巾的一头——显然他是忘了——这让我的手不由自主地哆嗦起来。我最后把杯子递给他的时候，惊讶地发现他眼里噙满了泪水。","There was a tray ready on a side-table.I brought it to the table near the fire, and asked him what he would have?He touched one of the bottles without looking at it or speaking, and I made him some hot rum-and-water.I tried to keep my hand steady while I did so, but his look at me as he leaned back in his chair with the long draggled end of his neckerchief between his teeth—evidently forgotten—made my hand very difficult to master.When at last I put the glass to him, I saw with amazement that his eyes were full of tears."
"直到那时我还是站着的，丝毫不掩饰我希望他走的意思。　　但看到他那么难过的样子，我也心软了，觉得有点对不住他。“我希望，”我匆匆给自己倒了杯酒，拖了把椅子到桌边，说，“我刚才对你说话不太客气，你不要介意。我不是有意这么做的，如果让你有这样的感觉，我向你道歉。我祝你身体好，心情好！”","Up to this time I had remained standing, not to disguise that I wished him gone.But I was softened by the softened aspect of the man, and felt a touch of reproach.“I hope,” said I, hurriedly putting something into a glass for myself, and drawing a chair to the table, “that you will not think I spoke harshly to you just now.I had no intention of doing it, and I am sorry for it if I did.I wish you well, and happy!”"
"我酒杯刚送到唇边，他一张嘴，围巾的那一头就掉了下来，他吃惊地看了看他的围巾，向我伸出手来。我把手递给他，他这才一边喝酒，一边用袖子擦了擦眼睛和额头。","As I put my glass to my lips, he glanced with surprise at the end of his neckerchief, dropping from his mouth when he opened it, and stretched out his hand.I gave him mine, and then he drank, and drew his sleeve across his eyes and forehead."
"“你过得怎么样？”我问他。","“How are you living?” I asked him."
"“我放过羊，养过牲口，还干过其他行当，在那个新世界，离这里远得很。”他说，“离这里好几千英里呢，隔着大风大浪的海洋。”","“I’ve been a sheep-farmer, stock-breeder, other trades besides, away in the new world,” said he: “many a thousand mile of stormy water off from this.”"
"“你干得不错吧？”","“I hope you have done well?”"
"“我干得很不错。和我一起去的人也有干得可以的，但没有人干得比我好。我可是出了名的。”","“I’ve done wonderfully well.There’s others went out alonger me as has done well too, but no man has done nigh as well as me.I’m famous for it.”"
"“听你这么说我真高兴。”","“I am glad to hear it.”"
"“我巴不得着你这么说呢，我的好孩子。”","“I hope to hear you say so, my dear boy.”"
"我既没停下来想一想他这话的意思，也没想一想他说这话的语调，就转到另一个话题上去了，是我刚刚想到的。","Without stopping to try to understand those words or the tone in which they were spoken, I turned off to a point that had just come into my mind."
"“你曾经派过一个人来看我，你见过他吗？”我问他，“自从他给你办过那件差事以后。”","“Have you ever seen a messenger you once sent to me,” I inquired, “since he undertook that trust?”"
"“我没有再见过他。我也没打算见他。”","“Never set eyes upon him.I warn’t likely to it.”"
"“他果然来了，给我送来两张一英镑的钞票。那个时候我还是个穷小子，你知道的，对一个穷小子来说，这笔钱可不是个小数目。不过，和你一样，从那以后我也干得很好了，这个钱我得还给你。你可以用这些钱接济别的穷孩子。”说着我便掏出钱包来。","“He came faithfully, and he brought me the two one-pound notes.I was a poor boy then, as you know, and to a poor boy they were a little fortune.But, like you, I have done well since, and you must let me pay them back.You can put them to some other poor boy’s use.”I took out my purse."
"他看着我把钱包放在桌上打开，看着我从里面取出两张一英镑的票子。这些是两张崭新的票子，我把票子展开了递给他。他一边看着我，一边把两张票子叠在一起，卷成一卷，把它们放在火上烧着了，最后把灰拨到托盘里。","He watched me as I laid my purse upon the table and opened it, and he watched me as I separated two one-pound notes from its contents.They were clean and new, and I spread them out and handed them over to him.Still watching me, he laid them one upon the other, folded them long-wise, gave them a twist, set fire to them at the lamp, and dropped the ashes into the tray."
"“我可不可以斗胆问一句，”他说，脸上的笑好像是在皱眉，皱着的眉头又好像是在笑，“你跟我在那片又荒又冷的沼泽地上分开以后，你的日子是怎么好起来的？”","“May I make so bold,” he said then, with a smile that was like a frown, and with a frown that was like a smile, “as ask you how you have done well, since you and me was out on them lone shivering marshes?”"
"“怎么好起来的？”","“How?”"
"“恩！”","“Ah!”"
"他一饮而尽，然后站起身来，站在火炉旁，把一只厚实、黝黑的手放在壁炉架上。他把一只脚搁在炉栏上面，既烘烘靴子又暖暖脚，那只湿的靴子开始冒蒸气，他既没有看他的靴子也没有看火炉，而是目不转睛地看着我。直到这时我才开始哆嗦起来。","He emptied his glass, got up, and stood at the side of the fire, with his heavy brown hand on the mantelshelf.He put a foot up to the bars, to dry and warm it, and the wet boot began to steam; but, he neither looked at it, nor at the fire, but steadily looked at me.It was only now that I began to tremble."
"我张开了嘴，想说点什么却没说出来，不得已才告诉他（虽然说得结结巴巴），说有人挑中了我，让我继承一笔财产。","When my lips had parted, and had shaped some words that were without sound, I forced myself to tell him (though I could not do it distinctly), that I had been chosen to succeed to some property."
"“像我这样的小毛虫可不可以问一下，是什么样的财产？”他问。","“Might a mere warmint ask what property?” said he."
"我支支吾吾地说：“我不知道。”","I faltered, “I don’t know.”"
"“像我这样的小毛虫可不可以问一下，是谁的财产？”他说。","“Might a mere warmint ask whose property?” said he."
"我还是支支吾吾地说：“我不知道。”","I faltered again, “I don’t know.”"
"“可不可以让我来猜一下，我想知道，”这位逃犯说，“你成年后的收入是多少！先猜第一位数字。是不是五？”","“Could I make a guess, I wonder,” said the Convict, “at your income since you come of age!As to the first figure now.Five?”"
"我的心跳像一把重锤在胡乱敲击一般。我从椅子上站了起来，手扶着椅背，一个劲地看着他。","With my heart beating like a heavy hammer of disordered action, I rose out of my chair, and stood with my hand upon the back of it, looking wildly at him."
"“说到监护人，”他继续说道，“你还没成年的时候，应该有个监护人，或者这一类的什么人。也许是个律师。我现在猜一下那个律师名字的第一个字吧。是不是一个‘贾’字？”","“Concerning a guardian,” he went on.“There ought to have been some guardian, or such-like, whiles you was a minor.Some lawyer, maybe.As to the first letter of that lawyer’s name now.Would it be J?”"
"关于我的处境的事实都向我一齐扑来，随后，失望、危险、羞耻等等所有的后果都劈头盖脸地向我扑来，我被它们击倒了，只觉得每一次呼吸都很困难。","All the truth of my position came flashing on me; and its disappointments, dangers, disgraces, consequences of all kinds, rushed in in such a multitude that I was borne down by them and had to struggle for every breath I drew."
"“这么说吧，”他接着说，“有这么个人，雇了这个名字第一个字是‘贾’的律师，可能叫贾格尔斯吧——他漂洋过海来到朴次茅斯，上了岸就一心想来找你。你刚才说‘可你找到我了’。是的！可我是怎么找到你的呢？噢，我在朴次茅斯写了封信，寄给伦敦的一个人，问他你的住址。那个人叫什么名字？噢，叫温米克。”","“Put it,” he resumed, “as the employer of that lawyer whose name begun with a J, and might be Jaggers—put it as he had come over sea to Portsmouth, and had landed there, and had wanted to come on to you.‘However, you have found me out,’ you said just now.Well!However, did I find you out?Why, I wrote from Portsmouth to a person in London, for particulars of your address.That person’s name?Why, Wemmick.”"
"我一句话也说不出来了，即使要我的命，我也说不出来了。我站在那里，一手扶着椅背，一手捂着胸口，好像呼吸困难的样子——我就这么站着，两眼盯着他，直到我觉得屋里开始天旋地转了，赶忙一把抓住了椅子。他扶住了我，把我扶到沙发旁，让我坐在垫子上，屈下一膝在我前面跪下了，他把脸凑到我面前，这张脸我现在记得很清楚，当时却是让我不寒而栗。","I could not have spoken one word, though it had been to save my life.I stood, with a hand on the chair-back and a hand on my breast, where I seemed to be suffocating—I stood so, looking wildly at him, until I grasped at the chair, when the room began to surge and turn.He caught me, drew me to the sofa, put me up against the cushions, and bent on one knee before me: bringing the face that I now well remembered, and that I shuddered at, very near to mine."
"“是的，皮普，好孩子，我把你培养成了一个绅士！是我一手培养的你呀！那时我就发誓，只要我挣了一个几尼，我就要把那个几尼给你。后来我发誓，只要我想法子发了财，我也要让你发财。我过得苦，为的是你过得舒服；我干得累，为的是你不用干活。这算得了什么，好孩子？我告诉你这些，是为了让你记得我的恩情吗？根本不是。我告诉你这些，是为了让你知道，当年被你救了一命的那只在粪堆里荡来荡去的丧家狗，现在也可以把头抬得老高了，因为他也可以培养一个绅士——皮普，那个绅士就是你呀！”","“Yes, Pip, dear boy, I’ve made a gentleman on you!It’s me wot has done it!I swore that time, sure as ever I earned a guinea, that guinea should go to you.I swore arterwards, sure as ever I spec’lated and got rich, you should get rich.I lived rough, that you should live smooth; I worked hard, that you should be above work.What odds, dear boy?Do I tell it, fur you to feel a obligation?Not a bit.I tell it, fur you to know as that there hunted dunghill dog wot you kep life in, got his head so high that he could make a gentleman—and, Pip, you’re him!”"
"我对这个人的厌恶感，对他的畏惧感，对他的躲避之意都到了无以复加的地步，哪怕他是一只可怕的野兽，也不过如此。","The abhorrence in which I held the man, the dread I had of him, the repugnance with which I shrank from him, could not have been exceeded if he had been some terrible beast."
"“听我说，皮普。我是你的第二个父亲。你就是我的儿子——其他人都比不上。我存钱都是为了给你花。人家雇我放羊的时候，我住在孤零零的屋子里，成天看着羊，一个人都看不到，我都快忘了男人和女人的脸长什么样了，这时我想起了你的脸。我在屋子里吃晚饭或者中饭的时候，常常吃着吃着就丢下餐刀，我说：‘那孩子又来了，在看着我吃吃喝喝呢！’我老是看见你，就跟我在雾蒙蒙的沼泽地里看到你的时候一样。‘上帝打死我吧！’每次我都这么说——我走到屋外，到朗朗乾坤下说——‘等我自由了、发财了，我要把那孩子培养成一个绅士，如果我没做到，上帝打死我吧！’我做到了。噢，瞧你，亲爱的孩子！看看你住的房子，贵族住的也不过如此！贵族？啊！你该拿你的钱去跟贵族比比，把他们比下去！”","“Look’ee here, Pip.I’m your second father.You’re my son—more to me nor any son.I’ve put away money, only for you to spend.When I was a hired-out shepherd in a solitary hut, not seeing no faces but faces of sheep till I half forgot wot men’s and women’s faces wos like, I see yourn.I drops my knife many a time in that hut when I was a-eating my dinner or my supper, and I said, ‘Here’s the boy again, a-looking at me whiles I eats and drinks!’I see you there a many times, as plain as ever I see you on them misty marshes.‘Lord strike me dead!’I said each time—and I goes out in the air to say it under the open heavens—‘but wot, if I gets liberty and money, I’ll make that boy a gentleman!’And I done it.Why, look at you, dear boy!Look at these here lodgings o’yourn, fit for a lord!A lord?Ah!You shall show money with lords for wagers, and beat ’em!”"
"他慷慨陈词、得意洋洋，他知道我已经快要晕过去了，就没有对我的反应说些什么。这让我好不容易有机会松了一口气。","In his heat and triumph, and in his knowledge that I had been nearly fainting, he did not remark on my reception of all this.It was the one grain of relief I had."
"“看看这个！”他从我口袋里掏出我的表来，又拉过我的手看看那枚戒指，这时我忙往后一缩，好像他是一条毒蛇一般，他继续说道，“一块金表，美极了，我看这才是绅士戴的表！一枚钻戒，镶了一圈的红宝石，我看这才是绅士戴的戒指！看看你的亚麻衬衫，质地多好，多漂亮啊！看看你的衣服，到哪里买更好的去！还有你的书，”他扫视了一眼屋子，“书架上堆了这么高，有几百本吧！这些书你都读吧，是不是？我进来的时候看见你在读的。哈，哈，哈！你该读给我听听，好孩子！就算是外国字写的，我听不懂，我也会跟听得懂一样得意的。”","“Look’ee here!” he went on, taking my watch out of my pocket, and turning towards him a ring on my finger, while I recoiled from his touch as if he had been a snake, “a gold ’un and a beauty: that’s a gentleman’s, I hope!A diamond all set round with rubies; that’s a gentleman’s, I hope!Look at your linen; fine and beautiful!Look at your clothes; better ain’t to be got!And your books too,” turning his eyes round the room, “mounting up, on their shelves, by hundreds!And you read ’em; don’t you?I see you’d been a reading of ’em when I come in.Ha, ha, ha!You shall read ’em to me, dear boy!And if they’re in foreign languages wot I don’t understand, I shall be just as proud as if I did.”"
"他又一次抓起我的手，放在嘴上亲了亲，我浑身的血液都凉了。","Again he took both my hands and put them to his lips, while my blood ran cold within me."
"“你不用说话，皮普。”他说，又用袖子擦了擦眼睛和额头，喉咙里又发出那种我记得很清楚的咔嗒声——他说得越郑重其事，我越害怕，“你最好还是别说话，好孩子。你不像我，我盼着这一天盼了这么久，你还没准备好呢。可你从来没想过，那个人会是我吗？”","“Don’t you mind talking, Pip,” said he, after again drawing his sleeve over his eyes and forehead, as the click came in his throat which I well remembered—and he was all the more horrible to me that he was so much in earnest; “you can’t do better nor keep quiet, dear boy.You ain’t looked slowly forward to this as I have; you wosn’t prepared for this, as I wos.But didn’t you never think it might be me?”"
"“哦，没，没，没，”我说，“从来没有，从来没有！”","“O no, no, no,” I returned, “Never, never!”"
"“哦，你现在知道了，是我，是我一个人。这事除了我和贾格尔斯先生以外，没有其他人知道。”","“Well, you see it wos me, and single-handed.Never a soul in it but my own self and Mr. Jaggers.”"
"“没有其他人了吗？”我问。","“Was there no one else?” I asked."
"“没有，”他吃惊地看了我一眼，说，“还会有谁知道呢？好孩子，你多英俊呀！有心上人了吧——嗯？就算还没有心上人，总有这个想法吧？”","“No,” said he, with a glance of surprise: “who else should there be?And, dear boy, how good looking you have growed!There’s bright eyes somewheres—eh?Isn’t there bright eyes somewheres, wot you love the thoughts on?”"
"哦，埃斯特拉，埃斯特拉！","O Estella, Estella!"
"“只要钱能买到的，你看上什么样的，都能到手。倒不是说像你这样的绅士，长得又这么英俊，光靠自己不能赢得她们的心，不过有了钱，你的底气可就更足了！我还是把我之前跟你说的话说完吧，好孩子。给我房住、雇我放羊的那家人留了笔钱给我（他们是和我出身一样的人，都死了），我自由了，又自己去谋出路了。我不管干什么，都是为了你。不管我去哪家干活，我都这么说，‘如果我做的一切不是为了他，上帝罚我不得好死！’我活干得棒极了。我刚才跟你说了，我干活可是出了名的。我把东家留给我的钱，还有我头几年挣的钱寄回来，寄给贾格尔斯先生——都是给你的——就在他答应了我信里的请求，第一次见了你以后。”","“They shall be yourn, dear boy, if money can buy ’em.Not that a gentleman like you, so well set up as you, can’t win ’em off of his own game; but money shall back you!Let me finish wot I was a-telling you, dear boy.From that there hut and that there hiring-out, I got money left me by my master (which died, and had been the same as me), and got my liberty and went for myself.In every single thing I went for, I went for you.‘Lord strike a blight upon it,’ I said, wotever it was I went for, ‘if it ain’t for him!’It all prospered wonderful.As I giv’ you to understand just now, I’m famous for it.It was the money left me, and the gains of the first few year wot I sent home to Mr. Jaggers—all for you—when he first come arter you, agreeable to my letter.”"
"哎，他要是从没来找过我就好了！要是他让我待在铁匠铺里就好了——虽然日子过得说不上有多满足，但也比现在快活！","O, that he had never come!That he had left me at the forge—far from contented, yet, by comparison happy!"
"“好孩子，你听我说，从那个时候起，只要暗自想到我在培养一位绅士，我就觉得值了。我在路上走着，那些殖民者骑着高头大马从我身边过，扬起的土弄得我满身都是，你猜我怎么说？我对自己说，‘我在培养一个绅士，他比你们谁都强！’他们中的一个对另一个说：‘他以前是个犯人，现在也就是个无知的、普普通通的家伙，不过是运气好罢了。’你猜我怎么说？我对自己说，‘就算我不是个绅士，也没有文化，可我培养出了一个有文化的绅士。你们拥有的只是牲口和田地，你们哪个拥有个一手养大的伦敦绅士？’我就是用这种方法获得动力的。我就是这样一直怀着一个愿望，有一天我一定要来看看我的孩子，在他的国土上，让他认出我来。”","“And then, dear boy, it was a recompense to me, look’ee here, to know in secret that I was making a gentleman.The blood horses of them colonists might fling up the dust over me as I was walking; what do I say?I said to myself, ‘I’m making a better gentleman nor ever you’ll be!’When one of ’em said to another, ‘He was a convict, a few year ago, and is a ignorant common fellow now, for all he’s lucky,’ what do I say?I said to myself, ‘If I ain’t a gentleman, nor yet ain’t got no learning, I’m the owner of such.All on you owns stock and land; which on you owns a brought-up London gentleman?’This way I kep myself a-going.And this way I held steady afore my mind that I would for certain come one day and see my boy, and make myself known to him, on his own ground.”"
"他把手放在我的肩上。想到他的手说不定沾过鲜血，我不由地浑身发抖。","He laid his hand on my shoulder.I shuddered at the thought that for anything I knew, his hand might be stained with blood."
"“皮普，我离开那地方很不容易，我可是冒着很大的风险啊。但我坚持这么做，越是困难，我越要这么做，因为我铁了心，打定了主意。最后我做到了。好孩子，我做到了！”","“It warn’t easy, Pip, for me to leave them parts, nor yet it warn’t safe.But I held to it, and the harder it was, the stronger I held, for I was determined, and my mind firm made up.At last I done it.Dear boy, I done it!”"
"我努力集中心思，但还是吓懵了，愣在那里。自始至终，我好像一直都把注意力放在狂风暴雨上，而不是他身上。即使到了这个时候，我还是没能把他的声音和狂风暴雨的声音区分开来，尽管风雨声不绝于耳，而他已不再说话。","I tried to collect my thoughts, but I was stunned.Throughout, I had seemed to myself to attend more to the wind and the rain than to him; even now, I could not separate his voice from those voices, though those were loud and his was silent."
"“你打算把我安顿到什么地方？”过了一会儿，他问我。“你得找个地方让我住下呀，好孩子。”","“Where will you put me?” he asked, presently.“I must be put somewheres, dear boy.”"
"“你是说过夜？”我问。","“To sleep?” said I."
"“是啊。我要好好睡上一觉。”他说，“我在海上颠来颠去，风吹浪打的，都好几个月了。”","“Yes.And to sleep long and sound,” he answered; “for I’ve been sea-tossed and sea-washed, months and months.”"
"我从沙发上站起身来，说，“我同住的那个朋友不在，你只好睡他的房间了。”","“My friend and companion,” said I, rising from the sofa, “is absent; you must have his room.”"
"“他明天不会回来吧，对么？”","“He won’t come back tomorrow; will he?”"
"“不会，”我虽然尽力了，但回答还是很勉强，“明天不会回来。”","“No,” said I, answering almost mechanically, in spite of my utmost efforts; “not tomorrow.”"
"“听着，好孩子，”他压低了嗓音+B357，拿长长的手指指着我的胸口，用一种让人难忘的神情对我说，“得小心啊。”","“Because, look’ee here, dear boy,” he said, dropping his voice, and laying a long finger on my breast in an impressive manner, “caution is necessary.”"
"“你这话是什么意思？小心？”","“How do you mean?Caution?”"
"“不小心就得死！”","“By G—, it’s Death!”"
"“为什么就得死？”","“What’s death?”"
"“我判的是终生流放。回来就是死罪。这些年回来的人太多了，我回来要是被发现了，就肯定得判绞刑。”","“I was sent for life.It’s death to come back.There’s been overmuch coming back of late years, and I should of a certainty be hanged if took.”"
"这已经够我受的了，这个可怜的人，多年来都在用用金的和银的链子供养我这个可怜的人，还冒着生命危险来看我，而他的性命现在就在我手上！我如果不是厌恶他，而是热爱他，如果不是对他怀着极大的反感之情，想要躲开他，而是怀着极大的钦佩、热爱之情，去跟他亲近，情况就不会这么糟糕了。相反，情况会好得多，我会自然而然地、发自内心地小心保护他的安全。","Nothing was needed but this; the wretched man, after loading wretched me with his gold and silver chains for years, had risked his life to come to me, and I held it there in my keeping!If I had loved him instead of abhorring him; if I had been attracted to him by the strongest admiration and affection, instead of shrinking from him with the strongest repugnance; it could have been no worse.On the contrary, it would have been better, for his preservation would then have naturally and tenderly addressed my heart."
"我首先想到的保护措施就是放下百叶窗，这样外面就看不到里面的光了，然后关紧所有的门。我这么做的时候，他正站在桌边喝着朗姆酒，嚼着饼干，我看着他这副样子，仿佛又看到了沼泽地里的那个逃犯吃东西的样子。我几乎觉得他就要弯下腰，用锉刀去锉开他的脚镣呢。","My first care was to close the shutters, so that no light might be seen from without, and then to close and make fast the doors.While I did so, he stood at the table drinking rum and eating biscuit; and when I saw him thus engaged, I saw my convict on the marshes at his meal again.It almost seemed to me as if he must stoop down presently, to file at his leg."
"我走进赫伯特的房间，把这间屋子和楼梯的通道都堵住了——除了我们刚才谈话的那个房间——我问他是不是要上床睡觉了。他说是的，还问我要了件“绅士的亚麻衬衣”，早上起来要穿。我拿了一件出来，给他放好了，他又一次抓起我的手，跟我道晚安，我浑身的血液又一次凉透了。","When I had gone into Herbert’s room, and had shut off any other communication between it and the staircase than through the room in which our conversation had been held, I asked him if he would go to bed?He said yes, but asked me for some of my “gentleman’s linen” to put on in the morning.I brought it out, and laid it ready for him, and my blood again ran cold when he again took me by both hands to give me good night."
"我总算摆脱了他，自己都不知道是怎么做到的，然后回到我们刚才呆的那间房里，添了点火，在火炉旁坐下了，根本不敢去睡觉。我在那里坐了一个多小时，昏昏沉沉地没法思考，等到我开始能够思考了，我才充分认识到我的处境有多可悲，我驾驶的那艘命运之船已经撞成了碎片。","I got away from him, without knowing how I did it, and mended the fire in the room where we had been together, and sat down by it, afraid to go to bed.For an hour or more, I remained too stunned to think; and it was not until I began to think, that I began fully to know how wrecked I was, and how the ship in which I had sailed was gone to pieces."
"郝维仙小姐对我的好意不过是场梦，她并没有把埃斯特拉许配给我，我在沙提斯庄园不过是个工具，用来刺痛她那些贪得无厌的亲戚，在没人可以折磨的时候，可以折磨我这个唯命是从的活靶子；而这些只是我痛苦的开始。但是最让我感到痛苦的是——因为这个罪犯的缘故，我竟然抛弃了乔。我不知道他犯了什么罪，他可能会被人从我现在呆的这间屋子里拖出去，在伦敦中央刑事法院执行绞刑。","Miss Havisham’s intentions towards me, all a mere dream; Estella not designed for me; I only suffered in Satis House as a convenience, a sting for the greedy relations, a model with a mechanical heart to practise on when no other practice was at hand; those were the first smarts I had.But, sharpest and deepest pain of all—it was for the convict, guilty of I knew not what crimes, and liable to be taken out of those rooms where I sat thinking, and hanged at the Old Bailey door, that I had deserted Joe."
"我已经没法回到乔那里去了，也没法回到比迪那里去了，无论如何也回不去了，我想原因很简单，因为我对他们的所作所为让我感到羞耻，即使有回去的理由，也会被这种羞耻感打消的。他们的淳朴和忠诚带给我的慰藉，世上没有哪个圣明的贤人能给得了，可我的所作所为却是永远、永远都无法挽回的了。","I would not have gone back to Joe now, I would not have gone back to Biddy now, for any consideration: simply, I suppose, because my sense of my own worthless conduct to them was greater than every consideration.No wisdom on earth could have given me the comfort that I should have derived from their simplicity and fidelity; but I could never, never, undo what I had done."
"外面每一阵狂风暴雨，都让我觉得好像听到了追捕者的声音。我发誓，我有两次听到了门外有人敲门的声音，还有小声说话的声音。心头压着这样的恐惧，我开始想象或者说回忆起来了，在这个人到来之前，我已经见到了种种神秘的预兆。几个星期前，我在街上看到的很多人的面孔，感觉都很像他。他漂洋过海，离我越近，和他长得像的人就越多。他们是他邪恶的灵魂派来的使者，在这样一个风雨交加的夜晚，他终于信守诺言，到我这里来了。","In every rage of wind and rush of rain, I heard pursuers.Twice, I could have sworn there was a knocking and whispering at the outer door.With these fears upon me, I began either to imagine or recall that I had had mysterious warnings of this man’s approach.That, for weeks gone by, I had passed faces in the streets which I had thought like his.That, these likenesses had grown more numerous, as he, coming over the sea, had drawn nearer.That, his wicked spirit had somehow sent these messengers to mine, and that now on this stormy night he was as good as his word, and with me."
"这些想法一股脑地涌过来，我想起了孩提时代亲眼看见的那个孤注一掷的人，我听到另外一个逃犯一再地说他要谋杀自己，我看见他在水沟里像野兽一样和那个人扭打在一起。这样想着想着，我看到火炉里隐隐约约+B390地浮现出一个可怕的影子，在这样一个寂静的深夜里，和他共处一室可能不大安全。那个可怕的影子越来越大，渐渐充满了整个房间，我不得已拿起一只蜡烛，进屋去看看那个让我害怕的包袱。","Crowding up with these reflections came the reflection that I had seen him with my childish eyes to be a desperately violent man; that I had heard that other convict reiterate that he had tried to murder him; that I had seen him down in the ditch tearing and fighting like a wild beast.Out of such remembrances I brought into the light of the fire, a half-formed terror that it might not be safe to be shut up there with him in the dead of the wild solitary night.This dilated until it filled the room, and impelled me to take a candle and go in and look at my dreadful burden."
"他卷起了一块手帕围在头上，面孔显得僵硬而阴沉。但他睡着了，睡得很沉，枕边放着一把手枪。我放心了，轻轻把房门上的钥匙取下，插在门外，把门反锁了，才又回到炉边坐下了。我睡着了，从椅子上慢慢滑了下来，躺在地板上。我一觉醒来，梦里都还想到自己的悲惨处境，无法摆脱，只听东边教堂的钟敲了五下，蜡烛烧完了，炉火熄灭了，狂风暴雨也把天色染得更黑了。","He had rolled a handkerchief round his head, and his face was set and lowering in his sleep.But he was asleep, and quietly too, though he had a pistol lying on the pillow.Assured of this, I softly removed the key to the outside of his door, and turned it on him before I again sat down by the fire.Gradually I slipped from the chair and lay on the floor.When I awoke, without having parted in my sleep with the perception of my wretchedness, the clocks of the Eastward churches were striking five, the candles were wasted out, the fire was dead, and the wind and rain intensified the thick black darkness."
"皮普远大前程的第二阶段告一段落。","THIS IS THE END OF THE SECOND STAGE OF PIP’S EXPECTATIONS."
"第四十章","Chapter 40"
"我一觉醒来，就想到要尽可能地采取预防措施,保证我这位可怕的不速之客的安全，也幸而这样，我才得以把其他杂乱的想法一股脑地全部抛开。","It was fortunate for me that I had to take precautions to ensure (so far as I could) the safety of my dreaded visitor; for, this thought pressing on me when I awoke, held other thoughts in a confused concourse at a distance."
"把他藏在家里显然是不可能的。不但不可能，就连这种尝试也不可避免地要让人起疑心。确实，我已经解雇了那个复仇鬼，但我现在又找了个颇有煽动性的老妈子，她还带了个挺机灵的邋遢姑娘做帮手，说是她侄女。想要锁住一间房瞒着她们，这只会激起她们的好奇心，让她们给添油加醋地传出去。她们两个眼睛都不好使，我一直把这归因于她们长年累月凑着钥匙孔偷窥的结果，她们总是在你不需要她们的时候出现。的确，除了小偷小摸之外，这一点是她们唯一可以确定的品质。为了不激起这两人的好奇心，我决定早上跟她们宣布，我伯父突然从乡下来看我了。","The impossibility of keeping him concealed in the chambers was self-evident.It could not be done, and the attempt to do it would inevitably engender suspicion.True, I had no Avenger in my service now, but I was looked after by an inflammatory old female, assisted by an animated rag-bag whom she called her niece, and to keep a room secret from them would be to invite curiosity and exaggeration.They both had weak eyes, which I had long attributed to their chronically looking in at keyholes, and they were always at hand when not wanted; indeed that was their only reliable quality besides larceny.Not to get up a mystery with these people, I resolved to announce in the morning that my uncle had unexpectedly come from the country."
"我就这么决定了，在黑暗中东摸西找了一阵，想找个火把灯点起来。最后摸来摸去没找着，我只得到毗邻的门房那里去，找看门人拿灯笼来照一下。我摸索着下楼，在黑漆漆的楼梯间被什么东西绊了一下，原来是个人蜷缩在角落里。","This course I decided on while I was yet groping about in the darkness for the means of getting a light.Not stumbling on the means after all, I was fain to go out to the adjacent Lodge and get the watchman there to come with his lantern.Now, in groping my way down the black staircase I fell over something, and that something was a man crouching in a corner."
"我问那个人在那里干什么，他没有回答我，只是默默地走开了。我跑到门房，催看门人赶快过去看看，回来的路上把我刚才所见之事跟他说了。风还是那么猛烈，我们没有重新点燃楼梯间的灯，生怕把灯笼里的火弄灭了。不过我们上上下下地把楼梯检查了一遍，却一个人也没找到。我突然想到，那个人可能溜到我屋子里去了。所以，我就用看门人的灯笼把蜡烛点着了，让他呆在门口。我仔细检查了一下每个房间，连我那可怕的不速之客睡觉的房间也检查到了。屋里一片寂静，可以肯定的是，屋子里没有别人。","As the man made no answer when I asked him what he did there, but eluded my touch in silence, I ran to the Lodge and urged the watchman to come quickly: telling him of the incident on the way back.The wind being as fierce as ever, we did not care to endanger the light in the lantern by rekindling the extinguished lamps on the staircase, but we examined the staircase from the bottom to the top and found no one there.It then occurred to me as possible that the man might have slipped into my rooms; so, lighting my candle at the watchman’s, and leaving him standing at the door, I examined them carefully, including the room in which my dreaded guest lay asleep.All was quiet, and assuredly no other man was in those chambers."
"一年三百六十五个晚上，偏偏在这个晚上楼梯间里潜伏了一个人，想到这一点我感到很不安。我在门边递给看门人一杯酒，抱着打探一丝线索的希望，问他有没有让什么外出吃饭晚归的人进来。他说有，晚上先后进来过三个人。一个住在喷泉坊，另外两个住在巷子里，他亲眼看见他们都回家去了。和我同住一栋房子的只有一位房客，他的房间在另一边，那个人到乡下去了好几个星期了，他晚上肯定没回来，因为我们上楼的时候看见他门上自己贴的封条还在。","It troubled me that there should have been a lurker on the stairs, on that night of all nights in the year, and I asked the watchman, on the chance of eliciting some hopeful explanation as I handed him a dram at the door, whether he had admitted at his gate any gentleman who had perceptibly been dining out?Yes, he said; at different times of the night, three.One lived in Fountain Court, and the other two lived in the Lane, and he had seen them all go home.Again, the only other man who dwelt in the house of which my chambers formed a part, had been in the country for some weeks; and he certainly had not returned in the night, because we had seen his door with his seal on it as we came up-stairs."
"“先生，今天晚上天气这么坏。”看门人把空杯递给我，说道，“从我大门里进来的人少得可怜。除了我刚才说的那三个人，我记不起还有别的人了，不过十一点钟的样子，有个陌生人打听您。”","“The night being so bad, sir,” said the watchman, as he gave me back my glass, “uncommon few have come in at my gate.Besides them three gentlemen that I have named, I don’t call to mind another since about eleven o’clock, when a stranger asked for you.”"
"“那是我伯父。”我喃喃低语道。“哦。”","“My uncle,” I muttered.“Yes.”"
"“您见到他了吗，先生？”","“You saw him, sir?”"
"“是的。见到了。”","“Yes.Oh yes.”"
"“还有和他一起来的那个人吧？”","“Likewise the person with him?”"
"“和他一起来的那个人！”我重复了一遍。","“Person with him!” I repeated."
"“我以为那个人是和他一起的。”看门人回答说，“您+B48伯父停下来向我打听你的时候，他也停了下来，你伯父往这边走，他也往这边走。”","“I judged the person to be with him,” returned the watchman.“The person stopped, when he stopped to make inquiry of me, and the person took this way when he took this way.”"
"“那个人什么样子？”","“What sort of person?”"
"看门人说他没怎么注意，只能说模样像个工人，他最多只能想起，那人穿着一件灰褐色的衣服，外面套了一件深色的外套。看门人没把这事看得很严重，不像我那样，这很自然，我把这事看得很严重是有我的理由的。","The watchman had not particularly noticed; he should say a working person; to the best of his belief, he had a dust-colored kind of clothes on, under a dark coat.The watchman made more light of the matter than I did, and naturally; not having my reason for attaching weight to it."
"我觉得最好不要再问下去了，就把他打发走了。这时，两方面的情况混在一起，让我的大脑一团混乱。本来这两种情况是互不相干，很容易解释清楚的——比如说，有人在外面或自己家里酒足饭饱之后，没从门房那里经过，而是不小心走到我这里的楼梯口了，在那里倒下就睡着了——还有，我这位不知姓名的不速之客可能找这个人给他带路，就把这个人带来了——可是，这两种情况凑到一起，对我这样一个几个小时前刚经历过巨大变故的人来说，自然显得疑点重重，让人惴惴不安。","When I had got rid of him, which I thought it well to do without prolonging explanations, my mind was much troubled by these two circumstances taken together.Whereas they were easy of innocent solution apart—as, for instance, some diner-out or diner-at-home, who had not gone near this watchman’s gate, might have strayed to my staircase and dropped asleep there—and my nameless visitor might have brought some one with him to show him the way—still, joined, they had an ugly look to one as prone to distrust and fear as the changes of a few hours had made me."
"我生起了炉火，炉火在晨曦中发出苍白而暗淡的光，我在炉火旁打起盹来。钟敲六下的时候，我醒了过来，感觉整整一晚上都在打盹。离天亮还足足有一个半小时，我于是又打起盹来。一会儿心神不安地醒来，好像有人在我耳边絮絮叨叨地说些无关紧要的话，一会儿又好像壁炉管道里的风在嚎叫。最后，我沉沉地睡着了，直到天光大亮方才惊醒过来。","I lighted my fire, which burnt with a raw pale flare at that time of the morning, and fell into a doze before it.I seemed to have been dozing a whole night when the clocks struck six.As there was full an hour and a half between me and daylight, I dozed again; now, waking up uneasily, with prolix conversations about nothing, in my ears; now, making thunder of the wind in the chimney; at length, falling off into a profound sleep from which the daylight woke me with a start."
"整个这一段时间，我还没来得及好好想想我的处境，现在也还不能。我没法把心思集中到这上面来。我沮丧万分、苦恼不已，而且，这种沮丧和苦恼是一阵一阵向我袭来的。至于说我以后有什么打算，我毫无头绪。我打开百叶窗向外望去，只见外面的清晨一片荒凉、潮湿，都成了铅灰色。我从这个房间踱到那个房间，然后又在火炉前坐下了，浑身瑟瑟发抖，等着我那洗衣妇上门。我想到自己是多么悲惨，却不知道为什么会这样，也不知道我处于这样的境地有多久了，更不知道我这种想法是从星期几开始的，甚至不知道有这种想法的“我”到底是谁。","All this time I had never been able to consider my own situation, nor could I do so yet.I had not the power to attend to it.I was greatly dejected and distressed, but in an incoherent wholesale sort of way.As to forming any plan for the future, I could as soon have formed an elephant.When I opened the shutters and looked out at the wet wild morning, all of a leaden hue; when I walked from room to room; when I sat down again shivering, before the fire, waiting for my laundress to appear; I thought how miserable I was, but hardly knew why, or how long I had been so, or on what day of the week I made the reflection, or even who I was that made it."
"老妈子和她侄女终于来了——她侄女的头发和她手上脏兮兮的扫帚简直难以区分开来——她看见我在壁炉旁，显然大吃了一惊。我对她们说，我伯父夜里过来了，现在正在睡觉，然后告诉她们早餐该进行哪些相应的改变。说完我就去盥洗更衣，这时她们就乒乒乓乓地收拾家具，扬起一阵灰尘。我精神恍惚，梦游般地又回到壁炉前坐下了，等着他出来吃早餐。","At last, the old woman and the niece came in—the latter with a head not easily distinguishable from her dusty broom—and testified surprise at sight of me and the fire.To whom I imparted how my uncle had come in the night and was then asleep, and how the breakfast preparations were to be modified accordingly.Then, I washed and dressed while they knocked the furniture about and made a dust; and so, in a sort of dream or sleep-waking, I found myself sitting by the fire again, waiting for—Him—to come to breakfast."
"终于，他的门开了，他从里面出来了。我简直不能容忍他这副样子，他在白天看起来比晚上还要难看。","By-and-by, his door opened and he came out.I could not bring myself to bear the sight of him, and I thought he had a worse look by daylight."
"“我甚至还不知道，”他在桌边坐下后，我低声跟他说，“该怎么称呼你。我跟她们说过你是我伯父。”","“I do not even know,” said I, speaking low as he took his seat at the table, “by what name to call you.I have given out that you are my uncle.”"
"“就这么叫吧，好孩子！就叫我伯父。”","“That’s it, dear boy!Call me uncle.”"
"“我想，你一路坐船过来，总有个名字吧？”","“You assumed some name, I suppose, on board ship?”"
"“有的，好孩子。我用的名字是普罗维斯。”","“Yes, dear boy.I took the name of Provis.”"
"“这个名字你打算一直用下去吗？”","“Do you mean to keep that name?”"
"“嗯，是啊，好孩子，用哪个名字都一样——除非你想要换一个。”","“Why, yes, dear boy, it’s as good as another—unless you’d like another.”"
"“你的真名是什么？”我低声问他。","“What is your real name?” I asked him in a whisper."
"“马格维奇，”他也低声回答，“教名是埃布尔。”","“Magwitch,” he answered, in the same tone; “chrisen’d Abel.”"
"“你原来是做什么的？”","“What were you brought up to be?”"
"“我不过是只小毛虫，好孩子。”","“A warmint, dear boy.”"
"他非常认真地回答我，说得好像小毛虫也是一种行当一样。","He answered quite seriously, and used the word as if it denoted some profession."
"“你昨晚来坦普尔的时候——”我说着停了下来，想了一下是不是昨晚，我感觉那仿佛是很久以前的事了。","“When you came into the Temple last night—” said I, pausing to wonder whether that could really have been last night, which seemed so long ago."
"“怎么了，好孩子？”","“Yes, dear boy?”"
"“你从大门进来，向看门人问路的时候，有没有人跟你在一起？”","“When you came in at the gate and asked the watchman the way here, had you any one with you?”"
"“跟我在一起？没有，好孩子。”","“With me?No, dear boy.”"
"“大门口没有别人吗？”","“But there was some one there?”"
"“这我倒没有很注意。”他含含糊糊地回答，“我对这一带不熟悉。不过我觉得是有个人跟着我过来了。”","“I didn’t take particular notice,” he said, dubiously, “not knowing the ways of the place.But I think there was a person, too, come in alonger me.”"
"“伦敦有人认识你吗？”","“Are you known in London?”"
"“但愿没有！”他一边说，一边用食指在脖子上使劲一抹，这动作让我既恼火又恶心。","“I hope not!” said he, giving his neck a jerk with his forefinger that made me turn hot and sick."
"“以前在伦敦有人认识你吗？”","“Were you known in London, once?”"
"“没有，好孩子。我基本上都呆在乡下。”","“Not over and above, dear boy.I was in the provinces mostly.”"
"“你是——在伦敦——受审的吗？”","“Were you—tried—in London?”"
"“哪一次？”他机警地看了我一眼。","“Which time?” said he, with a sharp look."
"“最近的那次。”","“The last time.”"
"他点了点头。“我就是那次认识贾格尔斯先生的。是他给我辩护的。”","He nodded.“First knowed Mr. Jaggers that way.Jaggers was for me.”"
"我正想问他犯了什么罪，只见他拿出一把小刀，在空中挥了挥，说：“我从前做的事都已经得到了惩罚！”说完又继续吃他的早餐。","It was on my lips to ask him what he was tried for, but he took up a knife, gave it a flourish, and with the words, “And what I done is worked out and paid for!” fell to at his breakfast."
"他狼吞虎咽地吃着，吃相十分不雅，一举一动都那么粗俗，吃的时候嘴里啧啧作响，跟很久没吃过东西一样。自从我上次在沼泽地里见他吃东西以来，他已经掉了几颗牙，嘴里不停地嚼着，时不时把头转向一边，用最坚固的犬牙去撕咬，他这副样子活像一只饥饿的老狗。如果说我一开始还有点胃口的话，看他这个样子，我一点胃口都没有了，只能坐在那里——我对他那种难以抑制的厌恶之情让我不由地排斥他，郁闷无比地盯着桌布。","He ate in a ravenous way that was very disagreeable, and all his actions were uncouth, noisy, and greedy.Some of his teeth had failed him since I saw him eat on the marshes, and as he turned his food in his mouth, and turned his head sideways to bring his strongest fangs to bear upon it, he looked terribly like a hungry old dog.If I had begun with any appetite, he would have taken it away, and I should have sat much as I did—repelled from him by an insurmountable aversion, and gloomily looking at the cloth."
"“我胃口可大了，好孩子，”他吃完了早餐，很客气地跟我道了个歉，“我一直都是这个样子。要不是我天生吃得多，我可能就不会惹上那么大的麻烦了。我抽起烟来也是这样。我在世界的另一头第一次被人雇去放羊的时候，要不是有烟抽的话，我估计自己早就闷得发了疯，自己也变成一只羊了。”","“I’m a heavy grubber, dear boy,” he said, as a polite kind of apology when he made an end of his meal, “but I always was.If it had been in my constitution to be a lighter grubber, I might ha’ got into lighter trouble.Similarly, I must have my smoke.When I was first hired out as shepherd t’other side the world, it’s my belief I should ha’ turned into a molloncolly-mad sheep myself, if I hadn’t a had my smoke.”"
"说着，他起了身，伸手从粗呢上衣口袋里掏出一根短短的黑色烟管，再掏出松松散散的一把烟草，他管这种烟草叫“黑人头”。填满烟管以后，他又把多出来的烟草放回去了，简直把他的口袋当成了抽屉。接着他从壁炉里钳出一块燃烧着的碳，用它把烟管点着了，然后在壁炉前的地毯上转过身，背对着炉火，又做出他最喜欢的姿势——伸出双手来要和我握手。","As he said so, he got up from the table, and putting his hand into the breast of the pea-coat he wore, brought out a short black pipe, and a handful of loose tobacco of the kind that is called Negro-head.Having filled his pipe, he put the surplus tobacco back again, as if his pocket were a drawer.Then, he took a live coal from the fire with the tongs, and lighted his pipe at it, and then turned round on the hearth-rug with his back to the fire, and went through his favorite action of holding out both his hands for mine."
"“这，”他双手夹着我的手，一上一下地摇着，嘴里吐着烟雾，说：“这就是我培养出来的绅士！一个真正的、地地道道的绅士！我只要能看看你就好，皮普。我渴望的就只是站在你旁边看一看你，好孩子！”","“And this,” said he, dandling my hands up and down in his, as he puffed at his pipe; “and this is the gentleman what I made!The real genuine One!It does me good fur to look at you, Pip.All I stip’late, is, to stand by and look at you, dear boy!”"
"我一有机会就把手挣脱了出来，觉得自己开始慢慢静下心来，可以想一想自己的处境了。每当我听见他沙哑的嗓音，坐在那里抬头看见他起伏不平的秃头，还有两旁铁灰色的头发，我就清楚地意识到，我身上套上了怎样的一条铁链，这条铁链又是多么沉重啊。","I released my hands as soon as I could, and found that I was beginning slowly to settle down to the contemplation of my condition.What I was chained to, and how heavily, became intelligible to me, as I heard his hoarse voice, and sat looking up at his furrowed bald head with its iron grey hair at the sides."
"“我决不愿意看见我的绅士在泥泞的街上走，决不能让他的靴子沾上泥。我的绅士得有自己的马，皮普！不光他自己要有马骑、有马坐，他的仆人也要有马骑、有马坐。那些殖民者有自己的马（还是纯种的，老天！），我的伦敦绅士就不能有？不行，不行。我们要让他们看看，才不是那么回事呢，是不是，皮普？”","“I mustn’t see my gentleman a footing it in the mire of the streets; there mustn’t be no mud on his boots.My gentleman must have horses, Pip!Horses to ride, and horses to drive, and horses for his servant to ride and drive as well.Shall colonists have their horses (and blood ’uns, if you please, good Lord!) and not my London gentleman?No, no.We’ll show ’em another pair of shoes than that, Pip; won’t us?”"
"他从口袋里掏出一个又大又厚的钱包——被纸钞塞得满满的——把它扔在桌上。","He took out of his pocket a great thick pocket-book, bursting with papers, and tossed it on the table."
"“这里面的钱够花好一阵子呢，好孩子。这是你的了。我的东西都不是我的，而是你的。别担心会花完。我还有很多呢。我回到故国来就是要看看我的绅士花起钱来那种气派的样子。这样我就高兴。我就高兴看他花钱。你们全都滚蛋！”他说完了，环顾了一下四周，打了一个很响的响指：“你们一个个都滚蛋，管你是戴假发的法官，还是把尘土扬得满天飞的殖民者，我要拿我的绅士给你们瞧瞧，你们全部加起来都比不上他一个！”","“There’s something worth spending in that there book, dear boy.It’s yours.All I’ve got ain’t mine; it’s yourn.Don’t you be afeerd on it.There’s more where that come from.I’ve come to the old country fur to see my gentleman spend his money like a gentleman.That’ll be my pleasure.My pleasure ’ull be fur to see him do it.And blast you all!” he wound up, looking round the room and snapping his fingers once with a loud snap, “blast you every one, from the judge in his wig, to the colonist a stirring up the dust, I’ll show a better gentleman than the whole kit on you put together!”"
"“别说了！”我对他几乎是既害怕又厌恶，“我要和你谈一谈。我想知道接下来怎么办。我想知道怎么让你避开危险，你打算在这里呆多久，你有什么计划。”","“Stop!” said I, almost in a frenzy of fear and dislike, “I want to speak to you.I want to know what is to be done.I want to know how you are to be kept out of danger, how long you are going to stay, what projects you have.”"
"“听我说，皮普，”他一只手搭在我的肩上，突然换了一种缓和的语气对我说，“先听我说。我刚才激动得忘乎所以了。我说的话都太粗俗，是这样的，粗俗。听我说，皮普。你别放在心上。我不会再说那种粗俗的话了。”","“Look’ee here, Pip,” said he, laying his hand on my arm in a suddenly altered and subdued manner; “first of all, look’ee here.I forgot myself half a minute ago.What I said was low; that’s what it was; low.Look’ee here, Pip.Look over it.I ain’t a-going to be low.”"
"“首先，”我继续说道，几乎是在呻吟，“我们要采取什么防范措施，以防你被人认出抓起来呢？”","“First,” I resumed, half-groaning, “what precautions can be taken against your being recognized and seized?”"
"“不，好孩子，”他还是用刚才那种语调说，“这不是最要紧的。最要紧的是我的粗俗。我花了这么多年来培养一个绅士，不会不知道该对绅士有礼貌。听我说，皮普。我很粗俗，我的确是这样的，粗俗。别放在心上，好孩子。”","“No, dear boy,” he said, in the same tone as before, “that don’t go first.Lowness goes first.I ain’t took so many years to make a gentleman, not without knowing what’s due to him.Look’ee here, Pip.I was low; that’s what I was; low.Look over it, dear boy.”"
"这个人荒唐得可笑，我不禁苦笑了一下，说，“我没放在心上。天啊，别再提这个了！”","Some sense of the grimly-ludicrous moved me to a fretful laugh, as I replied, “I have looked over it.In Heaven’s name, don’t harp upon it!”"
"“好，可是你听我说，”他坚持要说下去，“好孩子，我大老远过来，不是为了给你看我有多粗俗的。好了，你接着说吧，好孩子。你刚才说——”","“Yes, but look’ee here,” he persisted.“Dear boy, I ain’t come so fur, not fur to be low.Now, go on, dear boy.You was a-saying—”"
"“既然你已经处于危险的境地了，你打算怎么躲？”","“How are you to be guarded from the danger you have incurred?”"
"“嗯，好孩子，不是什么了不得的危险。只要没人告发我，这就不是什么了不得的危险。这件事只有贾格尔斯、温米克，还有你知道。还有谁会去告发我呢？”","“Well, dear boy, the danger ain’t so great.Without I was informed agen, the danger ain’t so much to signify.There’s Jaggers, and there’s Wemmick, and there’s you.Who else is there to inform?”"
"“有没有可能你在街上碰巧被人认出来？”我说。","“Is there no chance person who might identify you in the street?” said I."
"“嗯，”他说，“不会的。我也不会去登报宣传，说我马某从植物学湾回来了。都这么多年过去了，谁能从这件事里头捞到好处呢？听我说，皮普。就算危险是现在的五十倍，我也会来看你，来照顾你，也会做出同样的选择。","“Well,” he returned, “there ain’t many.Nor yet I don’t intend to advertise myself in the newspapers by the name of A. M. come back from Botany Bay; and years have rolled away, and who’s to gain by it?Still, look’ee here, Pip.If the danger had been fifty times as great, I should ha’ come to see you, mind you, just the same.”"
"“那你打算住多长时间呢？”","“And how long do you remain?”"
"“多长时间？”他从嘴里抽出那支黑色的烟管，下巴都快要掉下来了，惊讶地看着我。“我不打算回去了。我来了就不走了。”","“How long?” said he, taking his black pipe from his mouth, and dropping his jaw as he stared at me.“I’m not a-going back.I’ve come for good.”"
"“你打算住在哪里？”我问，“该怎么安排你呢？你呆在哪里才安全呢？”","“Where are you to live?” said I.“What is to be done with you?Where will you be safe?”"
"“好孩子，”他说，“只要有钱，就可以买假发，买头发香粉、眼镜、黑衣服——还有短裤，什么都可以买到。有人这样做了一点事都没有，人家都这么做了，其他人也还可以这么做。至于住在哪里、怎么过，好孩子，让我听听你的想法吧。”","“Dear boy,” he returned, “there’s disguising wigs can be bought for money, and there’s hair powder, and spectacles, and black clothes—shorts and what not.Others has done it safe afore, and what others has done afore, others can do agen.As to the where and how of living, dear boy, give me your own opinions on it.”"
"“你现在说起来倒是轻松，”我说，“可你昨晚还说得那么严重，十分肯定地说一旦被发现就是死路一条。”","“You take it smoothly now,” said I, “but you were very serious last night, when you swore it was Death.”"
"“我现在还是十分肯定地说，一旦被发现就是死路一条。”他把烟管又放回嘴里，说，“而且是绞刑，就在大街上，离这里不远，我是说真的，你应该充分认识到这一点。可那又怎样，既然已经到这一步了？我已经到这里来了。现在回去不会比留下来好——甚至还要糟。而且，皮普，我到这里来，是为了你来的，我盼了多少年啊。至于说冒险，我已经是一只老鸟了，自从羽毛长丰满以来，我什么罗网都躲过来了，现在不过是在稻草人身上停一停，有什么好怕的呢。就算死神躲在稻草人里面，就算是这样，那也让他出来吧，我要跟他面对面，这样我才会相信他，不过这个到时候再说吧。现在再让我瞧一瞧我的绅士吧。”","“And so I swear it is Death,” said he, putting his pipe back in his mouth, “and Death by the rope, in the open street not fur from this, and it’s serious that you should fully understand it to be so.What then, when that’s once done?Here I am.To go back now, ’ud be as bad as to stand ground—worse.Besides, Pip, I’m here, because I’ve meant it by you, years and years.As to what I dare, I’m a old bird now, as has dared all manner of traps since first he was fledged, and I’m not afeerd to perch upon a scarecrow.If there’s Death hid inside of it, there is, and let him come out, and I’ll face him, and then I’ll believe in him and not afore.And now let me have a look at my gentleman agen.”"
"他又一次抓起我的两只手，打量着我，那神情好像是在欣赏自己的财产，还一直带着极大满足感地抽着烟。","Once more, he took me by both hands and surveyed me with an air of admiring proprietorship: smoking with great complacency all the while."
"在我看来，除了在附近给他找一个僻静的住所外，我不知道有什么更好的做法了，我估计赫伯特两三天之内就会回来，等赫伯特一回来，就可以让他搬过去住。把这个秘密透露给赫伯特是不可避免的，而且很有必要，即使对我来说，跟他分享这个秘密，可以让我的心理负担减轻不少，这是毫无疑问的。但是对普罗维斯（我决定叫他这个名字）来说，这绝没有那么简单，他坚决不同意让赫伯特参与到这件事当中来，除非他亲眼见到赫伯特，对他的相貌觉得中意。“即使是这样，好孩子，”他从口袋里掏出一本扣着扣子的、黑色封皮的袖珍版《圣经》+B244说，“我们还得让他对着这个发誓。”","It appeared to me that I could do no better than secure him some quiet lodging hard by, of which he might take possession when Herbert returned: whom I expected in two or three days.That the secret must be confided to Herbert as a matter of unavoidable necessity, even if I could have put the immense relief I should derive from sharing it with him out of the question, was plain to me.But it was by no means so plain to Mr. Provis (I resolved to call him by that name), who reserved his consent to Herbert’s participation until he should have seen him and formed a favorable judgment of his physiognomy.“And even then, dear boy,” said he, pulling a greasy little clasped black Testament out of his pocket, “we’ll have him on his oath.”"
"我要是说，我这位可怕的恩主揣着这本袖珍黑皮书走遍世界，只是为了在紧要关头叫人发誓，我就有信口开河之嫌——但我敢说这样的话，因为我从没见他这本书派上过别的用场。这本书看起来像是从某个法庭上偷来的，可能他知道跟这本书有关的故事，而且他以前也这么做过，屡试不爽，这让他相信这本书具有某种法律的魔力或者魅力。一看见他拿出这本书，我就想起多年前他逼我在墓地里老老实实发誓的那一幕，还有他昨晚的描述，说他在异国他乡常常发誓，非实现自己的心愿不可。","To state that my terrible patron carried this little black book about the world solely to swear people on in cases of emergency, would be to state what I never quite established—but this I can say, that I never knew him put it to any other use.The book itself had the appearance of having been stolen from some court of justice, and perhaps his knowledge of its antecedents, combined with his own experience in that wise, gave him a reliance on its powers as a sort of legal spell or charm.On this first occasion of his producing it, I recalled how he had made me swear fidelity in the churchyard long ago, and how he had described himself last night as always swearing to his resolutions in his solitude."
"他现在穿的是一套海上穿的衣服，看起来像是有一批鹦鹉和雪茄急着要脱手似的，我下一步跟他商量他该穿什么衣服的问题。他极力坚持穿“短裤”作为伪装，举出种种好处，在脑海里给自己设计了一套衣服，照这样打扮，他看起来就该是一副介于牧师和牙医之间的样子。我费了九牛二虎之力才说服他，让他扮成一个富裕的农场主，我们还商定，让他把头发剪短，再敷上些粉。最后想到，既然那个洗衣妇和她侄女还没有见过他，干脆等他乔装打扮之后再在她们面前露面。","As he was at present dressed in a seafaring slop suit, in which he looked as if he had some parrots and cigars to dispose of, I next discussed with him what dress he should wear.He cherished an extraordinary belief in the virtues of “shorts” as a disguise, and had in his own mind sketched a dress for himself that would have made him something between a dean and a dentist.It was with considerable difficulty that I won him over to the assumption of a dress more like a prosperous farmer’s; and we arranged that he should cut his hair close, and wear a little powder.Lastly, as he had not yet been seen by the laundress or her niece, he was to keep himself out of their view until his change of dress was made."
"想好这些预防措施本来是很简单的事情，但我当时的状态即使说不上心烦意乱，也是头昏眼花，我们商量了大半天，结果我直到下午两三点钟才出门置办这些东西。我交代他，在我走的这段时间里他就呆在屋子里，哪里也别去，而且绝对不能开门。","It would seem a simple matter to decide on these precautions; but in my dazed, not to say distracted, state, it took so long, that I did not get out to further them, until two or three in the afternoon.He was to remain shut up in the chambers while I was gone, and was on no account to open the door."
"据我所知，埃塞克斯街上有一套不错的出租房，后面就对着坦普尔，从那里喊一声在我的窗户那边都能听见。我先去看房子，运气真好，我竟然给伯父普罗维斯先生租到了一间位于二楼的房子。租好房以后，我从一家店转到另一家，给他买必需的乔装用品。东西买好以后，我转身往小不列颠街走去，这回是为了我自己的事。贾格尔斯先生正在伏案工作，看见我进来，立刻起身站了起来，走到炉火前。","There being to my knowledge a respectable lodging-house in Essex-street, the back of which looked into the Temple, and was almost within hail of my windows, I first of all repaired to that house, and was so fortunate as to secure the second floor for my uncle, Mr. Provis.I then went from shop to shop, making such purchases as were necessary to the change in his appearance.This business transacted, I turned my face, on my own account, to Little Britain.Mr. Jaggers was at his desk, but, seeing me enter, got up immediately and stood before his fire."
"“皮普，”他说，“要小心啊。”","“Now, Pip,” said he, “be careful.”"
"“我会的，先生。”我说。来的路上我已经把要说的都想好了。","“I will, sir,” I returned.For, coming along I had thought well of what I was going to say."
"“不要犯错误，”贾格尔斯说，“也不要连累其他人。你明白吗——其他人。什么都不要告诉我，我什么都不想知道，我并不好奇。”","“Don’t commit yourself,” said Mr. Jaggers, “and don’t commit any one.You understand—any one.Don’t tell me anything: I don’t want to know anything; I am not curious.”"
"我一听就明白，他知道那个人回来了。","Of course I saw that he knew the man was come."
"“贾格尔斯先生，我只是想，”我说，“我只使想来证实一下，有人跟我说的话是不是真的。我并不指望那会是假话，但起码我得证实一下。”","“I merely want, Mr. Jaggers,” said I, “to assure myself that what I have been told, is true.I have no hope of its being untrue, but at least I may verify it.”"
"贾格尔斯先生点了点头。“你是说，有人‘跟你说’还是‘通知你’？”他问我的时候头侧在一旁，没有看我，而是看着地板，一副凝神细听的样子。“‘跟你说’听起来像是口头交流。你不可能和一个新南威尔士的人进行口头交流，你知道的。”","Mr. Jaggers nodded.“But did you say ‘told’ or ‘informed’?” he asked me, with his head on one side, and not looking at me, but looking in a listening way at the floor.“Told would seem to imply verbal communication.You can’t have verbal communication with a man in New South Wales, you know.”"
"“那我要说，是通知我的，贾格尔斯先生。”","“I will say, informed, Mr. Jaggers.”"
"“很好。”","“Good.”"
"“一个叫埃布尔·马格维奇的人通知我，他就是一直以来都没有向我透露过身份的恩主。”","“I have been informed by a person named Abel Magwitch, that he is the benefactor so long unknown to me.”"
"“就是这个人，”贾格尔斯先生说，“——新南威尔士的马格维奇。”","“That is the man,” said Mr. Jaggers, “—in New South Wales.”"
"“就他一个吗？”我问。","“And only he?” said I."
"“就他一个。”贾格尔斯先生说。","“And only he,” said Mr. Jaggers."
"“我不是蛮不讲理的人，先生，我不会把我的错误看法和结论都归咎于您，可我还一直以为我的恩主是郝维仙小姐呢。”","“I am not so unreasonable, sir, as to think you at all responsible for my mistakes and wrong conclusions; but I always supposed it was Miss Havisham.”"
"“如你所说，皮普，”贾格尔斯先生把目光转向了我，眼神很冷淡，咬了一下食指说，“我对这件事没有任何责任。”","“As you say, Pip,” returned Mr. Jaggers, turning his eyes upon me coolly, and taking a bite at his forefinger, “I am not at all responsible for that.”"
"“可看起来像是这样，先生。”我垂头丧气地为自己辩护。","“And yet it looked so like it, sir,” I pleaded with a downcast heart."
"“一星半点证据都没有，皮普。”贾格尔斯先生摇了摇头，整理了一下衣服的下摆，“凡事不能只看外表，要看证据。这是最好的一条金科玉律。”","“Not a particle of evidence, Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, shaking his head and gathering up his skirts.“Take nothing on its looks; take everything on evidence.There’s no better rule.”"
"我沉默了一会儿之后，叹了口气说：“我没什么要说的了。我的消息已经得到了证实，那就这样吧。”","“I have no more to say,” said I, with a sigh, after standing silent for a little while.“I have verified my information, and there’s an end.”"
"“马格维奇——新南威尔士的马格维奇——总算是露面了。”贾格尔斯先生说，“你会明白的，皮普，我和你的谈话一直都是严格按规矩来的，我一直坚持实事求是的原则。我从来没有背离过这个实事求是的原则。你很清楚这一点吧？”","“And Magwitch—in New South Wales—having at last disclosed himself,” said Mr. Jaggers, “you will comprehend, Pip, how rigidly throughout my communication with you, I have always adhered to the strict line of fact.There has never been the least departure from the strict line of fact.You are quite aware of that?”"
"“很清楚，先生。”","“Quite, sir.”"
"“马格维奇——新南威尔士的马格维奇——第一次从新南威尔士写信给我的时候，我在给他的回信里警告过他，我是绝对不可能背离实事求是的原则的。我还警告过他另一件事。他好像在信里隐约向我透露过，他有一丝到英国来看你的念头。我警告过他，别再让我听到这样的想法，他是不可能得到宽恕的，他判的是终生流放，他要是回国就构成重罪，这可是要判极刑的。我警告过马格维奇，”贾格尔斯先生紧盯着我说，“我在寄到新南威尔士的信里说了。他毫无疑问是理会了我的话。”","“I communicated to Magwitch—in New South Wales—when he first wrote to me—from New South Wales—the caution that he must not expect me ever to deviate from the strict line of fact.I also communicated to him another caution.He appeared to me to have obscurely hinted in his letter at some distant idea he had of seeing you in England here.I cautioned him that I must hear no more of that; that he was not at all likely to obtain a pardon; that he was expatriated for the term of his natural life; and that his presenting himself in this country would be an act of felony, rendering him liable to the extreme penalty of the law.I gave Magwitch that caution,” said Mr. Jaggers, looking hard at me; “I wrote it to New South Wales.He guided himself by it, no doubt.”"
"“毫无疑问。”我说。","“No doubt,” said I."
"“温米克告诉过我，”贾格尔斯先生接着说道，两眼仍然盯着我，“他收到过一封信，是从朴次茅斯寄来的，写信人是个殖民者，叫普尔维斯，又好像叫——”","“I have been informed by Wemmick,” pursued Mr. Jaggers, still looking hard at me, “that he has received a letter, under date Portsmouth, from a colonist of the name of Purvis, or—”"
"“普罗维斯。”我提醒他。","“Or Provis,” I suggested."
"“普罗维斯——谢谢你，皮普。也许就是这个普罗维斯吧？也许你是知道的，就是这个普罗维斯吧？”","“Or Provis—thank you, Pip.Perhaps it is Provis?Perhaps you know it’s Provis?”"
"“是的。”我说。","“Yes,” said I."
"“你知道就是这个普罗维斯。有个叫普罗维斯的殖民者写了一封信，从朴次茅斯寄过来，替马格维奇打听你的详细住址。温米克写了封信寄回去，把你的详细住址告诉了他，这我知道。新南威尔士的那个马格维奇告知你的那番解释，大概就是普罗维斯转达给你的吧？”","“You know it’s Provis.A letter, under date Portsmouth, from a colonist of the name of Provis, asking for the particulars of your address, on behalf of Magwitch.Wemmick sent him the particulars, I understand, by return of post.Probably it is through Provis that you have received the explanation of Magwitch—in New South Wales?”"
"“是普罗维斯转达的。”我答道。","“It came through Provis,” I replied."
"“那再见了，皮普，”贾格尔斯先生说，同时伸出手来，“很高兴又见到你。你要是写信给新南威尔士的马格维奇，或者写给普罗维斯要他转达，劳驾你提一下，我要把我们长期以来的账单细目和收据，连同余款一起寄给他，因为钱款还有一些结余。再见，皮普！”","“Good day, Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, offering his hand; “glad to have seen you.In writing by post to Magwitch—in New South Wales—or in communicating with him through Provis, have the goodness to mention that the particulars and vouchers of our long account shall be sent to you, together with the balance; for there is still a balance remaining.Good day, Pip!”"
"我们握手告别后，他一直盯着我走到门口。我转身出了门，他还盯着我，架子上那两尊塑像好像要竭力撑开眼皮，从肿胀的喉咙里挤出一句：“啊，瞧瞧这家伙！”","We shook hands, and he looked hard at me as long as he could see me.I turned at the door, and he was still looking hard at me, while the two vile casts on the shelf seemed to be trying to get their eyelids open, and to force out of their swollen throats, “O, what a man he is!”"
"温米克不在事务所，就算他在也帮不了我的忙。我直接回到坦普尔，发现吓人的普罗维斯正安安稳稳地喝着朗姆酒，抽着“黑人头”。","Wemmick was out, and though he had been at his desk he could have done nothing for me.I went straight back to the Temple, where I found the terrible Provis drinking rum-and-water and smoking negro-head, in safety."
"第二天，我订的衣服都送到家里来了，他一件一件地穿上了。不管他试哪一件，在我看来都不如他之前穿的那身合适，这让我很沮丧。我想，他身上应该是有种什么掩饰不住的东西，怎么乔装打扮都不管用。我越给他打扮，打扮得越好，他就越像当年沼泽地里那个无精打采的逃犯。无疑，我会产生这种不安的想法，部分是因为他当年的面孔和举止越来越清楚地浮现在我眼前，不过我认为，还有部分原因是他拖着一条腿，就好像腿上还拴着铁链一样，这个人从头到脚，就连骨子里都写着“逃犯”两字。","Next day the clothes I had ordered, all came home, and he put them on.Whatever he put on, became him less (it dismally seemed to me) than what he had worn before.To my thinking, there was something in him that made it hopeless to attempt to disguise him.The more I dressed him and the better I dressed him, the more he looked like the slouching fugitive on the marshes.This effect on my anxious fancy was partly referable, no doubt, to his old face and manner growing more familiar to me; but I believe too that he dragged one of his legs as if there were still a weight of iron on it, and that from head to foot there was Convict in the very grain of the man."
"他一个人在孤零零的小屋子里过日子，久而久之受了影响，身上带着一种野蛮气，穿什么衣服都遮掩不了。而且，他和那些殖民者生活在一起，身上还打着罪犯的烙印，最重要的是，他意识到自己现在是寄人篱下，过着躲躲藏藏的日子。他无论是坐、立、吃、喝的方式；或是肩头高耸，带着一副不情愿的表情思考问题的样子；或是掏出那把有角柄的大折刀，在腿上擦了擦就拿来切东西吃；或是把轻巧的玻璃杯或茶杯端起送到嘴边，好像这些杯子是笨重的金属器皿；或是切下一片面包，用它一遍一遍地吸着盘子里最后的一点肉汁，好像一丁点也不能浪费一样，然后再吸吸手指头上的汁水，最后把面包片吃下肚——他的这些举动，以及他一天之内每时每刻数不胜数的细小动作，无不向人透露他是一个蹲过监狱、判过重罪、带过脚镣和手铐的家伙。","The influences of his solitary hut-life were upon him besides, and gave him a savage air that no dress could tame; added to these, were the influences of his subsequent branded life among men, and, crowning all, his consciousness that he was dodging and hiding now.In all his ways of sitting and standing, and eating and drinking—of brooding about, in a high-shouldered reluctant style—of taking out his great horn-handled jack-knife and wiping it on his legs and cutting his food—of lifting light glasses and cups to his lips, as if they were clumsy pannikins—of chopping a wedge off his bread, and soaking up with it the last fragments of gravy round and round his plate, as if to make the most of an allowance, and then drying his finger-ends on it, and then swallowing it—in these ways and a thousand other small nameless instances arising every minute in the day, there was Prisoner, Felon, Bondsman, plain as plain could be."
"在头上敷点粉是他自己的主意，他答应不穿短裤，我才同意让他敷粉。但他头上一敷上粉，这效果在我看来就好比在死人脸上抹上胭脂，什么东西到了他身上就变得别扭起来，这薄薄的一层伪装本来是为了更好地掩饰，反而让他的头顶成了关注的焦点。这个试过以后就立刻被否决了，只是把他的灰白头发剪短了一些。","It had been his own idea to wear that touch of powder, and I had conceded the powder after overcoming the shorts.But I can compare the effect of it, when on, to nothing but the probable effect of rouge upon the dead; so awful was the manner in which everything in him that it was most desirable to repress, started through that thin layer of pretence, and seemed to come blazing out at the crown of his head.It was abandoned as soon as tried, and he wore his grizzled hair cut short."
"与此同时，我对这个可怕的神秘人物的感觉简直无法用语言来形容。晚上，他在安乐椅上睡着了，骨节突出的双手抓着椅子的扶手，布满皱纹的秃头耷拉在胸前。我就坐在旁边看着他，想知道他到底犯了什么罪，我把各种罪名都加到他身上，直到不敢再猜下去了，就站起身，到离他远远的地方去。我对他的厌恶感与日俱增，要不是想到赫伯特很快就要回来了，我甚至觉得，我可能会因为受不了这种痛苦的纠缠而一走了之，不管他对我有过多大的恩惠，为我承担过多大的风险。有一天晚上，我真的从床上一跃而起，找出最破旧的衣服穿上，急不可耐地想要摆脱他，把我所有的东西都留给他，到印度去当个列兵。","Words cannot tell what a sense I had, at the same time, of the dreadful mystery that he was to me.When he fell asleep of an evening, with his knotted hands clenching the sides of the easy-chair, and his bald head tattooed with deep wrinkles falling forward on his breast, I would sit and look at him, wondering what he had done, and loading him with all the crimes in the Calendar, until the impulse was powerful on me to start up and fly from him.Every hour so increased my abhorrence of him, that I even think I might have yielded to this impulse in the first agonies of being so haunted, notwithstanding all he had done for me, and the risk he ran, but for the knowledge that Herbert must soon come back.Once, I actually did start out of bed in the night, and begin to dress myself in my worst clothes, hurriedly intending to leave him there with everything else I possessed, and enlist for India as a private soldier."
"在这样风雨不绝的漫漫长夜里，在这样孤寂冷清的屋子里，我怀疑即便有鬼魂，也不见得会比他更恐怖吧。鬼魂不可能因为我而被逮捕、被绞死，而我想到他却是有可能的，我怕他真的会被逮捕、被绞死，这让我更感到毛骨悚然了。有时他不睡觉，有时他拿出随身带的一副破烂不堪的牌，玩一种复杂而且需要耐心的游戏——我以前从没见过这种玩法，以后也没见人玩过。他每赢一局，就用折刀在桌子上刻上一笔——当他既不睡觉也不玩牌的时候，就要我念书给他听——“读外语给我听，好孩子！”我就依了他，读了起来，他虽然一个字也听不懂，却站在火炉前，带着一副展览会参展商的神情打量着我。我用一只手遮着光，透过指缝，我看见他对着家具打哑剧似的做着手势，像是让它们都来听听我读得有多流利一样。当年那个突发奇想，亵渎神灵，亲手创造了一个怪物，反被怪物缠住的学生的处境不见得比我悲惨。我现在被这个人缠住，而我却是他一手栽培出来的，他越是夸奖我、喜欢我，我就越讨厌他，越想躲开他。","I doubt if a ghost could have been more terrible to me, up in those lonely rooms in the long evenings and long nights, with the wind and the rain always rushing by.A ghost could not have been taken and hanged on my account, and the consideration that he could be, and the dread that he would be, were no small addition to my horrors.When he was not asleep, or playing a complicated kind of patience with a ragged pack of cards of his own—a game that I never saw before or since, and in which he recorded his winnings by sticking his jack-knife into the table—when he was not engaged in either of these pursuits, he would ask me to read to him—“Foreign language, dear boy!”While I complied, he, not comprehending a single word, would stand before the fire surveying me with the air of an Exhibitor, and I would see him, between the fingers of the hand with which I shaded my face, appealing in dumb show to the furniture to take notice of my proficiency.The imaginary student pursued by the misshapen creature he had impiously made, was not more wretched than I, pursued by the creature who had made me, and recoiling from him with a stronger repulsion, the more he admired me and the fonder he was of me."
"写到这里，我感觉这样的情形持续了一年之久。事实上不过五天而已。我天天在等赫伯特回来，不敢出门，只是在天黑以后才带普罗维斯出去透透气。终于有一天，吃过晚饭我精疲力尽地睡着了——因为我夜里总是心神不宁、噩梦连连——楼梯上传来的朝思暮想的脚步声把我惊醒了。普罗维斯本来也睡着了，听到我的动静之后，他跌跌撞撞地起了身。转眼间，我看见他那把水手刀已经握在手上了，明晃晃的。","This is written of, I am sensible, as if it had lasted a year.It lasted about five days.Expecting Herbert all the time, I dared not go out, except when I took Provis for an airing after dark.At length, one evening when dinner was over and I had dropped into a slumber quite worn out—for my nights had been agitated and my rest broken by fearful dreams—I was roused by the welcome footstep on the staircase.Provis, who had been asleep too, staggered up at the noise I made, and in an instant I saw his jack-knife shining in his hand."
"“别动！是赫伯特！”我说。这时赫伯特大步走了进来，身上带着一股六百英里之外的法国的清新气息。","“Quiet!It’s Herbert!” I said; and Herbert came bursting in, with the airy freshness of six hundred miles of France upon him."
"“汉德尔，我的好兄弟，你好吗，你好吗，你好吗？我感觉离开了整整一年那么久！哎呀，我一定是离开了一年了吧，要不你怎么会变得这么瘦、这么苍白！汉德尔，我的——啊呀！对不起，请问这位是？”","“Handel, my dear fellow, how are you, and again how are you, and again how are you?I seem to have been gone a twelvemonth!Why, so I must have been, for you have grown quite thin and pale!Handel, my—Halloa! I beg your pardon.”"
"他正一个劲地说着，正和我握着手，突然停住了，因为他看见了普罗维斯。普罗维斯正全神贯注地看着他，他慢慢收起水手刀，在另一个口袋里摸索着，想掏出个别的什么东西来。","He was stopped in his running on and in his shaking hands with me, by seeing Provis.Provis, regarding him with a fixed attention, was slowly putting up his jack-knife, and groping in another pocket for something else."
"“赫伯特，我亲爱的朋友，”我一边说着，一边去关双层门，而他则站在那里，疑惑不解地望着我，“发生了一件很奇怪的事情。这位是——我的客人。”","“Herbert, my dear friend,” said I, shutting the double doors, while Herbert stood staring and wondering, “something very strange has happened.This is—a visitor of mine.”"
"“没事，好孩子！”普罗维斯走上前来，手里拿着那本带扣的黑皮袖珍书，对赫伯特说，“你右手拿着这本书。如果你走漏了风声，不管什么情况，你都要立刻被上帝用雷劈死！亲一下它！”","“It’s all right, dear boy!” said Provis coming forward, with his little clasped black book, and then addressing himself to Herbert.“Take it in your right hand.Lord strike you dead on the spot, if ever you split in any way sumever!Kiss it!”"
"“照他说的做吧。”我对赫伯特说。赫伯特看着我，友好中带着不安和惊讶，但还是照他的话做了。他一做完，普罗维斯就和他握手，说：“你从现在起要遵守诺言了。要是皮普不让你成为一个绅士，你就别再相信我了！”","“Do so, as he wishes it,” I said to Herbert.So, Herbert, looking at me with a friendly uneasiness and amazement, complied, and Provis immediately shaking hands with him, said, “Now you’re on your oath, you know.And never believe me on mine, if Pip shan’t make a gentleman on you!”"
"第四十一章","Chapter 41"
"我、赫伯特、普罗维斯三个人在火炉前坐下了，我把这个秘密完完全全地向赫伯特复述了一遍，赫伯特当时的惊讶和不安，我无须赘述。只消说两点，那就是，我从赫伯特的脸上看到了我自己的感受，在这些感受中，我很清楚地看到，对于这个对我有大恩大德的人，我对他的厌恶之情也反映在赫伯特脸上了。","In vain should I attempt to describe the astonishment and disquiet of Herbert, when he and I and Provis sat down before the fire, and I recounted the whole of the secret.Enough, that I saw my own feelings reflected in Herbert’s face, and, not least among them, my repugnance towards the man who had done so much for me."
"他在听我讲述的时候露出一副得意洋洋的样子，如果说我和赫伯特跟他之间原本并无其他隔阂，可单单这一点就足以造成隔阂了。他总是记得他回来后说过一次粗俗的话——我话音刚落，他就开始对赫伯特滔滔不绝地讲了起来——他哪里会想到，我交了好运却还对此不满呢。他夸耀说，自己把我培养成了一个绅士，他来是要看我如何依靠他的巨资，维持绅士的身份，这既是对我的夸耀，也是对他自己的夸耀。这个夸耀对我们两个都是十分贴切的，我们对此都该自豪不已，这个结论已经在他脑海里扎了根。","What would alone have set a division between that man and us, if there had been no other dividing circumstance, was his triumph in my story.Saving his troublesome sense of having been “low” on one occasion since his return—on which point he began to hold forth to Herbert, the moment my revelation was finished—he had no perception of the possibility of my finding any fault with my good fortune.His boast that he had made me a gentleman, and that he had come to see me support the character on his ample resources, was made for me quite as much as for himself; and that it was a highly agreeable boast to both of us, and that we must both be very proud of it, was a conclusion quite established in his own mind."
"“不过，听我说，皮普的朋友，”他滔滔不绝说了一阵子后，对赫伯特说，“我很清楚，我回国后有一次——有半分钟的时间——很粗俗。我跟皮普说过了，我知道自己很粗俗。可你不要为这个发愁。我把皮普培养成一个绅士，皮普又要把你培养成一个绅士，我不会不知道该怎么对待你们两个绅士。好孩子，还有你，皮普的朋友，你们两个相信我，我会一直戴上文雅的口套。自从我在那半分钟里说了粗俗的话以后，我就戴上了口套，现在也戴着，以后还要戴下去。”","“Though, look’ee here, Pip’s comrade,” he said to Herbert, after having discoursed for some time, “I know very well that once since I come back—for half a minute—I’ve been low.I said to Pip, I knowed as I had been low.But don’t you fret yourself on that score.I ain’t made Pip a gentleman, and Pip ain’t a-going to make you a gentleman, not fur me not to know what’s due to ye both.Dear boy, and Pip’s comrade, you two may count upon me always having a genteel muzzle on.Muzzled I have been since that half a minute when I was betrayed into lowness, muzzled I am at the present time, muzzled I ever will be.”"
"赫伯特嘴上说：“当然。”但他看上去好像没有并因此得到宽慰，他仍然满是困惑和沮丧。我们都焦急地等他回到他的住所去，好让我们两个单独呆着，但他显然是嫉妒我们两个单独呆着，一直坐到很晚才走。我绕道把他送到了埃塞克斯街，看着他平安无事地迈进了那扇黑漆漆的门，这时已经是午夜时分了。门在他身后关上了，我这才松了口气，从他来的那个晚上直到现在，我还是第一次觉得轻松。","Herbert said, “Certainly,” but looked as if there were no specific consolation in this, and remained perplexed and dismayed.We were anxious for the time when he would go to his lodging, and leave us together, but he was evidently jealous of leaving us together, and sat late.It was midnight before I took him round to Essex-street, and saw him safely in at his own dark door.When it closed upon him, I experienced the first moment of relief I had known since the night of his arrival."
"我总会想起楼梯口那个人，惴惴不安的感觉始终挥之不去。我带着我这位客人晚上出门的时候总要四处张望，带他回来也是如此，这回我也少不了环顾一番。身处大城市，若担心自己处于被人监视的危险境地，那就难免要怀疑自己被人监视着，但我很难相信，出现在我视野里的这些人当中，会有人关注着我的一举一动。路上的行人屈指可数，都在各赶各的路，我返回坦普尔的时候，街上空荡荡的。我们出大门时，没有人一起出来，我进大门时，也没有人一起进来。穿过喷水池的时候，我看见他的后窗亮着，看起来既明亮又安静，我上楼之前，在自己家门道里站了一会儿，只觉得花园坊一带寂静无声、了无生气，我上了楼，楼梯上也是一样的情形。","Never quite free from an uneasy remembrance of the man on the stairs, I had always looked about me in taking my guest out after dark, and in bringing him back; and I looked about me now.Difficult as it is in a large city to avoid the suspicion of being watched, when the mind is conscious of danger in that regard, I could not persuade myself that any of the people within sight cared about my movements.The few who were passing, passed on their several ways, and the street was empty when I turned back into the Temple.Nobody had come out at the gate with us, nobody went in at the gate with me.As I crossed by the fountain, I saw his lighted back windows looking bright and quiet, and, when I stood for a few moments in the doorway of the building where I lived, before going up the stairs, Garden-court was as still and lifeless as the staircase was when I ascended it."
"赫伯特张开双臂迎接我，我以前从未感受过有个朋友是一件多么幸福的事。他说了几句对我表示同情和鼓励的话，然后，我们坐下来考虑这个问题：接下来该怎么办？","Herbert received me with open arms, and I had never felt before, so blessedly, what it is to have a friend.When he had spoken some sound words of sympathy and encouragement, we sat down to consider the question, What was to be done?"
"普罗维斯坐的椅子还在原处——因为他过惯了蹲牢房的日子，习惯了在一个地方逗留，用一种惴惴不安的方式，把他的烟斗、“黑人头”、水手刀，还有扑克牌之类的东西拿出来摆弄一番，好像这些是给他规定好了必须要做的事情似的——且说，他的椅子还在原处，赫伯特无意中坐了上去，但下一秒钟就跳了起来，把椅子一把推开，坐到另一把椅子上去了。这样一来，他对我的恩主的厌恶之情自不必说了，而我也不必袒露我的心声了。我们一句话也没有说，就互相了解了对方的意思。","The chair that Provis had occupied still remaining where it had stood—for he had a barrack way with him of hanging about one spot, in one unsettled manner, and going through one round of observances with his pipe and his negro-head and his jack-knife and his pack of cards, and what not, as if it were all put down for him on a slate—I say, his chair remaining where it had stood, Herbert unconsciously took it, but next moment started out of it, pushed it away, and took another.He had no occasion to say, after that, that he had conceived an aversion for my patron, neither had I occasion to confess my own.We interchanged that confidence without shaping a syllable."
"“我们，”赫伯特在另一把椅子上坐稳之后，我问他，“我们该做些什么呢？”","“What,” said I to Herbert, when he was safe in another chair, “what is to be done?”"
"“我可怜的、亲爱的汉德尔，”他用手托着脑袋说，“我被吓呆了，已经没法思考了。”","“My poor dear Handel,” he replied, holding his head, “I am too stunned to think.”"
"“我也是，赫伯特，当这个打击第一次向我袭来的时候。可是，我们得做些什么才行。他下定决心要买这买那来摆阔——要买马、买马车、还要买各种各样的奢侈品。我们得想办法阻止他。”","“So was I, Herbert, when the blow first fell.Still, something must be done.He is intent upon various new expenses—horses, and carriages, and lavish appearances of all kinds.He must be stopped somehow.”"
"“你的意思是你不能接受——”","“You mean that you can’t accept—”"
"“我怎么可以呢？”赫伯特稍一停顿，我便插了一句，“想想他是什么人！看看他那副样子！”","“How can I?” I interposed, as Herbert paused.“Think of him!Look at him!”"
"我们两人都不由自主地打了个寒颤。","An involuntary shudder passed over both of us."
"“可我害怕的是这样一个可怕的事实，赫伯特，那就是：他已经粘上了我，牢牢地粘上了我。怎么会是这样的命运！”","“Yet I am afraid the dreadful truth is, Herbert, that he is attached to me, strongly attached to me.Was there ever such a fate!”"
"“我可怜的、亲爱的汉德尔。”赫伯特又说了一次。","“My poor dear Handel,” Herbert repeated."
"“那么，”我说，“不管之前怎样，我要到此为止，不再拿他一分钱，想想我已经欠了他那么多！再说，我现在负债累累——对我来说债务非常重，我现在没有遗产了——而且我没有一技之长，我一无是处。”","“Then,” said I, “after all, stopping short here, never taking another penny from him, think what I owe him already!Then again: I am heavily in debt—very heavily for me, who have now no expectations—and I have been bred to no calling, and I am fit for nothing.”"
"“好了，好了，好了！”赫伯特劝慰我，“不要说自己一无是处。”","“Well, well, well!” Herbert remonstrated.“Don’t say fit for nothing.”"
"“我能做什么呢？我只知道有一件事我做得了，那就是去当兵。我亲爱的赫伯特，要不是想到你的友谊和情分，想听听你的意见，我可能早就去当兵了。”","“What am I fit for?I know only one thing that I am fit for, and that is, to go for a soldier.And I might have gone, my dear Herbert, but for the prospect of taking counsel with your friendship and affection.”"
"说到这里，我真的几近崩溃了，赫伯特紧紧地、热情地握住我的手，装作没看见我崩溃的样子。","Of course I broke down there: and of course Herbert, beyond seizing a warm grip of my hand, pretended not to know it."
"“不管怎样，我亲爱的汉德尔，”过了一会儿，他说，“当兵可不是办法。如果你要拒绝他做你的恩主，拒绝他给你的恩惠，我想你这么做是带着一丝希望，希望有朝一日能偿还他给你的一切。如果你去当兵的话，这个希望可就不太大了！再说，这想法也太荒谬了。克拉利克公司虽然小，但你要是去的话可比当兵不知强多少倍。我现在正向合伙人的目标努力呢，你知道的。”","“Anyhow, my dear Handel,” said he presently, “soldiering won’t do.If you were to renounce this patronage and these favors, I suppose you would do so with some faint hope of one day repaying what you have already had.Not very strong, that hope, if you went soldiering!Besides, it’s absurd.You would be infinitely better in Clarriker’s house, small as it is.I am working up towards a partnership, you know.”"
"可怜的人！他都没有怀疑过他用的是谁的钱。","Poor fellow!He little suspected with whose money."
"“但还有一个问题，”赫伯特说，“他这个人无知无识又死心眼，早就拿定了主意。而且，他在我眼里（我可能对他的评判有失公正）是个孤注一掷而且性情刚烈的人。”","“But there is another question,” said Herbert.“This is an ignorant determined man, who has long had one fixed idea.More than that, he seems to me (I may misjudge him) to be a man of a desperate and fierce character.”"
"“我知道，他是这样的人。”我说，“跟你说说我亲眼见到的一件事吧，可以作为根据。”然后我就告诉了他我之前的讲述中没有提到的事，他和另一个逃犯的那次狭路相逢。","“I know he is,” I returned.“Let me tell you what evidence I have seen of it.”And I told him what I had not mentioned in my narrative; of that encounter with the other convict."
"“你看看，”赫伯特说，“想一想吧！他冒着生命危险到这里来，就是为了实现他的宿愿。吃了这么多苦，等了这么多年，愿望终于实现了，这个时候你却拆了他的台，毁了他的愿望，让他的辛劳所得变得一文不值。他心灰意冷了，什么事做不出来呀，这个你想过吗？”","“See, then,” said Herbert; “think of this!He comes here at the peril of his life, for the realization of his fixed idea.In the moment of realization, after all his toil and waiting, you cut the ground from under his feet, destroy his idea, and make his gains worthless to him.Do you see nothing that he might do, under the disappointment?”"
"“我想过，赫伯特，梦里还想着这事呢，从他到来的那个不幸的晚上开始。我是再清楚不过了，他说不定会去自首。”","“I have seen it, Herbert, and dreamed of it, ever since the fatal night of his arrival.Nothing has been in my thoughts so distinctly, as his putting himself in the way of being taken.”"
"“那你等着瞧吧，他说不定会这么做的。”赫伯特说，“他要是这么做了，危险可就大了。只要他在英国，他就有权力控制你，如果你抛弃他，他不顾一切也要这么做的。”","“Then you may rely upon it,” said Herbert, “that there would be great danger of his doing it.That is his power over you as long as he remains in England, and that would be his reckless course if you forsook him.”"
"他这个说法把我吓住了，我本来从一开始就有这个顾虑，假如这一说法成了现实，我真的会在某种程度上把自己看成是杀害他的凶手，想到这里，我在椅子上再也坐不住了，开始来回踱着步子。我一边踱着步子一边对赫伯特说，即使普罗维斯最终还是被人认了出来，被逮捕了，而不是去自首，我也会觉得是我害了他，不管我有多么无辜。是的，我让他逍遥法外，把他留在自己身边，即使这样已经让我够苦恼的了。如果能让我一辈子呆在铁匠铺里，而不是落到现在这个地步，我也会心甘情愿得多。","I was so struck by the horror of this idea, which had weighed upon me from the first, and the working out of which would make me regard myself, in some sort, as his murderer, that I could not rest in my chair but began pacing to and fro.I said to Herbert, meanwhile, that even if Provis were recognized and taken, in spite of himself, I should be wretched as the cause, however innocently.Yes; even though I was so wretched in having him at large and near me, and even though I would far far rather have worked at the forge all the days of my life than I would ever have come to this!"
"但有个问题却是无法回避的，那就是：接下来该怎么办呢？","But there was no staving off the question, What was to be done?"
"“眼下的当务之急，”赫伯特说，“就是把他弄出英国。你得和他一起走，这样才可能劝得动他。”","“The first and the main thing to be done,” said Herbert, “is to get him out of England.You will have to go with him, and then he may be induced to go.”"
"“可是不管我把他带到哪里，我能阻止他回来吗？”","“But get him where I will, could I prevent his coming back?”"
"“我的好汉德尔，纽盖特监狱就在隔壁那条街上，你在这里向他表露你的想法，把他惹火了，这可比在其他任何地方都危险得多，这不是明摆的事吗？如果能拿另外那个逃犯，或者他的其他什么生平经历做借口把他打发走，那现在就该动手了。”","“My good Handel, is it not obvious that with Newgate in the next street, there must be far greater hazard in your breaking your mind to him and making him reckless, here, than elsewhere.If a pretext to get him away could be made out of that other convict, or out of anything else in his life, now.”"
"“好了，你又来了！”我在赫伯特面前停住了脚步，双手一摊，好像这件事的无奈之处都包含在这双手里了。“我对他的生平一无所知。每天晚上坐在这里，看着他就在我面前，我简直要疯了，我无论走运还是倒霉，都跟他扯到了一起，可我对他却一无所知，除了我童年的时候被这个可怜虫吓了整整两天！”","“There, again!” said I, stopping before Herbert, with my open hands held out, as if they contained the desperation of the case.“I know nothing of his life.It has almost made me mad to sit here of a night and see him before me, so bound up with my fortunes and misfortunes, and yet so unknown to me, except as the miserable wretch who terrified me two days in my childhood!”"
"赫伯特站了起来，挽着我的胳膊，我们并排慢慢来回踱着步子，眼睛盯着地毯。","Herbert got up, and linked his arm in mine, and we slowly walked to and fro together, studying the carpet."
"“汉德尔，”赫伯特停了下来，说，“你确定你再也不接受他给你的任何好处了，是吗？”","“Handel,” said Herbert, stopping, “you feel convinced that you can take no further benefits from him; do you?”"
"“完全确定。如果你处于我的境地，你也会这么做吧？”","“Fully.Surely you would, too, if you were in my place?”"
"“你确定你必须跟他断绝关系吗？”","“And you feel convinced that you must break with him?”"
"“赫伯特，这还用问吗？”","“Herbert, can you ask me?”"
"“他为了你冒了生命危险，他这条命你得怜惜，而且必须怜惜，有可能的话，你必须救他，而不是抛弃他。在你尽举手之劳让自己脱身之前，你必须先把他弄出英国。把他弄出国以后，你再让自己脱身，上帝作证，之后我们再一起想办法，亲爱的老朋友。”","“And you have, and are bound to have, that tenderness for the life he has risked on your account, that you must save him, if possible, from throwing it away.Then you must get him out of England before you stir a finger to extricate yourself.That done, extricate yourself, in Heaven’s name, and we’ll see it out together, dear old boy.”"
"我们就此欣慰地握了握手表示同意，达成了这一项共识之后，我们又来回踱起了步子。","It was a comfort to shake hands upon it, and walk up and down again, with only that done."
"“嗯，赫伯特，”我说，“关于打探他的生平经历这件事。我知道的就只有一个办法。我必须直截了当地问他。”","“Now, Herbert,” said I, “with reference to gaining some knowledge of his history.There is but one way that I know of.I must ask him point-blank.”"
"“对。去问他。”赫伯特说，“我们早上坐下来吃早餐的时候。”原来，他跟赫伯特告别的时候说过，他第二天要来跟我们一起吃早餐。","“Yes.Ask him,” said Herbert, “when we sit at breakfast in the morning.”For, he had said, on taking leave of Herbert, that he would come to breakfast with us."
"计划谈妥之后，我们就上床睡觉了。我晚上做了许多关于他的、荒唐透顶的梦，醒来时还是精神不振，晚上还担心他潜逃回国的流亡犯的身份被人发现。本来这一担心已经打消，现在又浮上心头。只要我醒着，这种担心就一直萦绕在我心头。","With this project formed, we went to bed.I had the wildest dreams concerning him, and woke unrefreshed; I woke, too, to recover the fear which I had lost in the night, of his being found out as a returned transport.Waking, I never lost that fear."
"第二天早上，他准时到了，拿出他那把水手刀，坐下来开始用餐。他满肚子的计划，要“让他的绅士出人头地，像个绅士的样子”，催促我动用他给我的那满满一皮夹子钱。他觉得我的这套房间还有他自己租住的房子只是临时住所，建议我赶紧去海德公园附近找一个“时髦的窝”，他好在里面“搭张铺”。他吃完了早餐，又在腿上擦过他的刀，我这才开门见山地对他说：","He came round at the appointed time, took out his jack-knife, and sat down to his meal.He was full of plans “for his gentleman’s coming out strong, and like a gentleman,” and urged me to begin speedily upon the pocket-book, which he had left in my possession.He considered the chambers and his own lodging as temporary residences, and advised me to look out at once for a “fashionable crib” near Hyde Park, in which he could have “a shake-down”.When he had made an end of his breakfast, and was wiping his knife on his leg, I said to him, without a word of preface:"
"“昨晚你走了之后，我跟我的朋友谈起，当年一伙官兵赶到沼泽地，发现你正和人打架，那时我也正好赶到。你还记得吗？”","“After you were gone last night, I told my friend of the struggle that the soldiers found you engaged in on the marshes, when we came up.You remember?”"
"“记得！”他说，“我想我记得！”","“Remember!” said he.“I think so!”"
"“我们想了解一些关于那个人的情况——还有你的情况。说来奇怪，我对你们两个了解的就这么多，尤其是你，结果我昨晚说了几句就说不下去了。你能不能趁这个机会让我们多知道一些呢？”","“We want to know something about that man—and about you.It is strange to know no more about either, and particularly you, than I was able to tell last night.Is not this as good a time as another for our knowing more?”"
"“好吧！”他想了一下，说，“你要知道你发过誓的，是不是，皮普的朋友？”","“Well!” he said, after consideration.“You’re on your oath, you know, Pip’s comrade?”"
"“没错。”赫伯特说。","“Assuredly,” replied Herbert."
"“不管我说了什么，你要知道，”他坚持说道，“你都得遵守誓言。”","“As to anything I say, you know,” he insisted.“The oath applies to all.”"
"“我明白。”","“I understand it to do so.”"
"“你听好了！不管我做过什么，我都得到了应有的惩罚。”他又一次坚持说道。","“And look’ee here!Wotever I done, is worked out and paid for,” he insisted again."
"“但愿如此。”","“So be it.”"
"他掏出黑烟斗，打算往里面塞“黑人头”。突然，他看了看手里乱七八糟的一团烟草，好像觉得这团烟草可能会打乱他叙述的线索。于是他把烟草塞了回去，把烟斗插在外套的一个纽扣里，两手放在膝盖上，然后，默默地看着炉火，眼里带着怒气，这样过了一会儿之后，他把眼睛转向我们，给我们讲了下面的故事。","He took out his black pipe and was going to fill it with negrohead, when, looking at the tangle of tobacco in his hand, he seemed to think it might perplex the thread of his narrative.He put it back again, stuck his pipe in a button-hole of his coat, spread a hand on each knee, and, after turning an angry eye on the fire for a few silent moments, looked round at us and said what follows."
"第四十二章","Chapter 42"
"“好孩子，还有你，皮普的朋友。我来给你们说说我的人生经历，这段经历既不像歌曲那么动听，也不像故事那么有趣。但要简单、明了地跟你们说，我只要念几句顺口溜，你们就明白了。进了牢房出牢房，进了牢房出牢房，进了牢房出牢房。好了，你们知道了吧。这就是我的人生，后来我和皮普交上了朋友，再后来我被押上了船，打发到海外去了。”","“Dear boy and Pip’s comrade.I am not a-going fur to tell you my life, like a song or a story-book.But to give it you short and handy, I’ll put it at once into a mouthful of English.In jail and out of jail, in jail and out of jail, in jail and out of jail.There, you got it.That’s my life pretty much, down to such times as I got shipped off, arter Pip stood my friend.”"
"“我什么刑罚都受过了——只剩下绞刑了。他们把我当成银茶壶那样的宝贝似的锁了起来。他们把我装上车，从这里运到那里，从这座城运到那座城，对我又是上脚铐，又是鞭打，又是折磨，又是驱赶的。我是在哪里生的，别说你们，就连我自己都不知道。我第一次意识到世上有我这个人的存在，是在埃塞克斯，在我为了活命偷萝卜的时候。有个人丢下我跑了——一个男人——一个补锅匠——还把炉子也带走了，留下我一个人受冻。”","“I’ve been done everything to, pretty well—except hanged.I’ve been locked up, as much as a silver tea-kettle.I’ve been carted here and carted there, and put out of this town and put out of that town, and stuck in the stocks, and whipped and worried and drove.I’ve no more notion where I was born, than you have—if so much.I first become aware of myself, down in Essex, a thieving turnips for my living.Summun had run away from me—a man—a tinker—and he’d took the fire with him, and left me wery cold.”"
"“我知道我叫马格维奇，教名叫埃布尔。我是怎么知道的？这就好比我知道树篱上的小鸟的名字，这个叫花鸡、那个叫麻雀、那个叫画眉。起先我也怀疑过这些名字，觉得它们都是胡扯，不过既然小鸟的名字是对的，我想我的名字也不会错吧。”","“I know’d my name to be Magwitch, chrisen’d Abel.How did I know it?Much as I know’d the birds’ names in the hedges to be chaffinch, sparrer, thrush.I might have thought it was all lies together, only as the birds’ names come out true, I supposed mine did.”"
"“我还记得，这个小埃布尔·马格维奇没吃的、没穿的，没人见了他不讨厌他，不是赶他走，就是去逮他。我不停地被人逮来逮去，逮到后来我就给逮大了。”","“So fur as I could find, there warn’t a soul that see young Abel Magwitch, with us little on him as in him, but wot caught fright at him, and either drove him off, or took him up.I was took up, took up, took up, to that extent that I reg’larly grow’d up took up.”"
"“事情就是这样，我从小就穿得破破烂烂，没有人比我更可怜了（我不是从镜子里看到我的可怜样的，因为我到过的人家有镜子的不多），我老手的称号可是出了名了。‘这是个非常厉害的老手。’他们指着我，对来探监的人说，‘可以说是在监狱里长大的，这孩子。’”“然后他们看看我，我也看看他们，然后他们打量打量我的脑袋，有些人其实是在打量我的肚子——也有一些人给我一些东西读，我都读不懂，还给我做一番长篇大论，我都听不懂。他们总是给我讲关于魔鬼的事情。可魔鬼跟我有什么关系呢？我得填饱肚子，不是吗？——不过，我是个粗人，我知道怎么做才是对的。好孩子，还有你，皮普的朋友，你们不要被我的粗俗吓到。”","“This is the way it was, that when I was a ragged little creetur as much to be pitied as ever I see (not that I looked in the glass, for there warn’t many insides of furnished houses known to me), I got the name of being hardened.‘This is a terrible hardened one,’ they says to prison wisitors, picking out me.‘May be said to live in jails, this boy.’”“Then they looked at me, and I looked at them, and they measured my head, some on ’em—they had better a-measured my stomach—and others on ’em giv me tracts what I couldn’t read, and made me speeches what I couldn’t understand.They always went on agen me about the Devil.But what the Devil was I to do?I must put something into my stomach, mustn’t I?—Howsomever, I’m a getting low, and I know what’s due.Dear boy and Pip’s comrade, don’t you be afeerd of me being low.”"
"“流浪、讨饭、偷东西，有活干的时候也干干活——虽然不像你们想的那样经常有活干，你们可以问问自己，假如你们要雇人，会雇我这样一个人吗——有时到人家庄园里偷猎，有时打打短工，有时赶赶大车，有时晒晒干草，有时沿街叫卖。我干的事情大多不但没有报酬，还尽惹麻烦，我就是这样长大成人的。一次，有家旅店来了一个逃兵，全身上下裹着破布，一直裹到了下巴，他教我读书。还有一个行走江湖的巨人，专门给人签名，每签一个名收一便士，他教我写字。我现在牢房进得比以前少了，不过，那把牢房门的钥匙可是磨得油光发亮，这里面还有我的功劳呢。”","“Tramping, begging, thieving, working sometimes when I could—though that warn’t as often as you may think, till you put the question whether you would ha’ been over-ready to give me work yourselves—a bit of a poacher, a bit of a laborer, a bit of a waggoner, a bit of a haymaker, a bit of a hawker, a bit of most things that don’t pay and lead to trouble, I got to be a man.A deserting soldier in a Traveler’s Rest, what lay hid up to the chin under a lot of taturs, learnt me to read; and a travelling Giant what signed his name at a penny a time learnt me to write.I warn’t locked up as often now as formerly, but I wore out my good share of keymetal still.”"
"“二十多年前，在埃普瑟姆赛马场，我认识了一个人。我要是再见到他，就要用这根像龙虾的大钳子一样的拔火棒把他的脑壳敲碎——假如他的脑壳就放在这炉盘上的话。他名字叫康培生，就是这个人，好孩子，你当年看见我在水沟里打的那个人，昨天晚上我走了以后，你跟你朋友说起的这个人。”","“At Epsom races, a matter of over twenty years ago, I got acquainted wi’ a man whose skull I’d crack wi’ this poker, like the claw of a lobster, if I’d got it on this hob.His right name was Compeyson; and that’s the man, dear boy, what you see me a-pounding in the ditch, according to what you truly told your comrade arter I was gone last night.”"
"“他自以为是个绅士，这个康培生，进过公立寄宿学校，是个文化人。这个人能说会道，看起来有那么点上等人的样子。他长得也还不赖。大赛马会的前一天，我在荒原上的+B51那家小酒店里见到了他。我进去的时候，他正和其他几个人坐在桌子旁边，店老板（他认识我；他是个喜欢赌博的家伙）把他叫出去，跟他说：‘我觉得这个人可能适合你’——他说的是我。”","“He set up fur a gentleman, this Compeyson, and he’d been to a public boarding-school and had learning.He was a smooth one to talk, and was a dab at the ways of gentlefolks.He was good-looking too.It was the night afore the great race, when I found him on the heath, in a booth that I know’d on.Him and some more was a sitting among the tables when I went in, and the landlord (which had a knowledge of me, and was a sporting one) called him out, and said, ‘I think this is a man that might suit you’—meaning I was.”"
"“康培生仔仔细细地打量了我一番，我也打量了他一番。他身上挂了块表，手上戴了枚戒指，衣服上别了根胸针，衣服穿得很体面。”","“Compeyson, he looks at me very noticing, and I look at him.He has a watch and a chain and a ring and a breast-pin and a handsome suit of clothes.”"
"“‘看起来，你不太走运嘛。’康培生对我说。”","“‘To judge from appearances, you’re out of luck,’ says Compeyson to me.”"
"“‘是的，先生，我从来就没走过什么运。’（我最近一次坐牢是因为流浪罪，刚从金斯顿监狱出来没多久。就算不为这个罪，那也是为别的罪而坐过牢，但这次不是因为别的罪。）”","“‘Yes, master, and I’ve never been in it much.’(I had come out of Kingston Jail last on a vagrancy committal.Not but what it might have been for something else; but it warn’t.)”"
"“‘时来运转，’康培生说，‘说不定你的好运就要来了。’”","“‘Luck changes,’ says Compeyson; ‘perhaps yours is going to change.’”"
"“我说：‘但愿如此。等机会吧。’”","“I says, ‘I hope it may be so.There’s room.’”"
"“‘你会做什么？’康培生问我。”","“‘What can you do?’ says Compeyson.”"
"“‘吃吃喝喝，’我说，‘只要你给我吃的、喝的。’”","“‘Eat and drink,’ I says; ‘if you’ll find the materials.’”"
"“康培生笑了，又仔仔细细地打量了我一番，给了我五个先令，约我第二天晚上再来见他。地点不变。”","“Compeyson laughed, looked at me again very noticing, giv me five shillings, and appointed me for next night.Same place.”"
"“第二天晚上我就去老地方见康培生了，康培生雇我当他的帮手和合伙人。康培生要跟我合伙做什么行当呢？康培生干的是诈骗钱财、伪造字据、把偷来的钱设法甩出这一类的勾当。凡是康培生想到了什么自己能从中获利，却不会受到牵连，而让别人给他卖命的阴谋诡计，他没有不做的。他的心像铁锉刀一样硬，跟死尸一样冷，他的脑子跟我之前提到过的魔鬼一样坏。”","“I went to Compeyson next night, same place, and Compeyson took me on to be his man and pardner.And what was Compeyson’s business in which we was to go pardners?Compeyson’s business was the swindling, handwriting forging, stolen bank-note passing, and such-like.All sorts of traps as Compeyson could set with his head, and keep his own legs out of and get the profits from and let another man in for, was Compeyson’s business.He’d no more heart than an iron file, he was as cold as death, and he had the head of the Devil afore mentioned.”"
"“跟康培生同伙的还有一个人，叫阿瑟——不是他的教名，只是个外号。他有痨病，看起来像个鬼一样。多年以前，他和康培生勾搭起来，骗了一个有钱人家的小姐，从中得了一大笔钱，不过康培生把钱都赌光了，像他那样的花法，王家国库给他花都不够。最后，阿瑟的病一天比一天重，而且一天比一天穷，还得了酒疯，康培生的老婆（康培生动不动就对她拳打脚踢）总是尽可能地同情他，而康培生可是对任何人、任何事都是无情无义的。”","“There was another in with Compeyson, as was called Arthur—not as being so chrisen’d, but as a surname.He was in a Decline, and was a shadow to look at.Him and Compeyson had been in a bad thing with a rich lady some years afore, and they’d made a pot of money by it; but Compeyson betted and gamed, and he’d have run through the king’s taxes.So, Arthur was a-dying, and a-dying poor and with the horrors on him, and Compeyson’s wife (which Compeyson kicked mostly) was a-having pity on him when she could, and Compeyson was a-having pity on nothing and nobody.”"
"“我本该从阿瑟身上吸取教训的，可我没有。我不需要假装我有什么特别的——我在你们面前假装有什么好处呢，好孩子，还有你，好孩子的朋友？就这样我开始跟康培生混了，在他手里我就是一个可怜的工具。阿瑟住在康培生家的顶楼（就在布伦特福德附近），他在那里吃住的费用康培生都详细记录了下来，这样他身体要是好了就得干活抵债。不过阿瑟很快就还清了这笔债。我第二次还是第三次看见他时是一天深夜，他跌跌撞撞地冲进康培生家的客厅，只穿了一件法兰绒睡衣，满头大汗，连头发都湿透了，他对康培生老婆说：‘萨莉，她真的跟我上楼来了，我甩不掉她。她穿着一身白衣服，’他说，‘头上戴着白花，她简直是疯了，太可怕了，胳膊上还搭着块裹尸布，她说她要在早上五点的时候用裹尸布把我裹起来。’”","“I might a-took warning by Arthur, but I didn’t; and I won’t pretend I was partick’ler—for where ’ud be the good on it, dear boy and comrade?So I begun wi’ Compeyson, and a poor tool I was in his hands.Arthur lived at the top of Compeyson’s house (over nigh Brentford it was), and Compeyson kept a careful account agen him for board and lodging, in case he should ever get better to work it out.But Arthur soon settled the account.The second or third time as ever I see him, he come a-tearing down into Compeyson’s parlor late at night, in only a flannel gown, with his hair all in a sweat, and he says to Compeyson’s wife, ‘Sally, she really is upstairs alonger me, now, and I can’t get rid of her.She’s all in white,’ he says, ‘wi’ white flowers in her hair, and she’s awful mad, and she’s got a shroud hanging over her arm, and she says she’ll put it on me at five in the morning.’”"
"“康培生说：‘哎呀，你这个笨蛋，你难道不知道她是个活人吗？她没有从大门进来，也没有爬窗子进来，更没有上楼，她怎么进得了你的房间呢？’”","“Says Compeyson: ‘Why, you fool, don’t you know she’s got a living body?And how should she be up there, without coming through the door, or in at the window, and up the stairs?’”"
"“‘我不知道她是怎么进来的，’阿瑟吓得浑身发抖地说，‘可她就站在床脚的那个角落里，疯了一样，太可怕了。她的心都碎了——是你撕碎的！——血一滴、一滴地往下滴。’”","“‘I don’t know how she’s there,’ says Arthur, shivering dreadful with the horrors, ‘but she’s standing in the corner at the foot of the bed, awful mad.And over where her heart’s brook—you broke it!—there’s drops of blood.’”"
"“康培生虽然说话强硬，但他其实是个懦夫。‘你跟这个满口胡言乱语的病人一起上去，’他对他老婆说，‘马格维奇，你帮一帮她，行不行？’可他自己从没走近一步。”","“Compeyson spoke hardy, but he was always a coward.‘Go up alonger this drivelling sick man,’ he says to his wife, ‘and Magwitch, lend her a hand, will you?’But he never come nigh himself.”"
"“康培生老婆和我扶他到楼上，让他重新躺在床上，他只是一个劲地胡言乱语。‘哎呀，瞧她！’他大喊大叫，‘她拿着裹尸布在我面前晃！你们没看见她吗？看她的眼睛！看她这个疯疯癫癫的样子不会害怕吗？’他接着喊道，‘她要把裹尸布披到我身上，那样我就没命了！把它从她手上拿走，拿走！’然后他抓住我们两个，嘴里不停地跟她说话，回答她的问题，弄得我半信半疑起来，觉得自己也看见她本人了。”","“Compeyson’s wife and me took him up to bed again, and he raved most dreadful.‘Why look at her!’ he cries out.‘She’s a-shaking the shroud at me!Don’t you see her?Look at her eyes!Ain’t it awful to see her so mad?’Next, he cries, ‘She’ll put it on me, and then I’m done for!Take it away from her, take it away!’And then he catched hold of us, and kep on a-talking to her, and answering of her, till I half believed I see her myself.”"
"“康培生老婆已经习惯了他这个样子，给他喝了点酒压压惊，他渐渐安静了下来。‘啊，她走了！那个看管她的人把她带走了吗？’他问。‘带走了。’康培生老婆说。‘你跟他说了把她锁起来，不让她出去吗？’‘说了。’‘你说了把那个讨厌的玩意从她手上拿走吗？‘说了，说了，没事了。’‘你真是个好人，’他说，‘不管你做什么都不要离开我，谢谢你！’”","“Compeyson’s wife, being used to him, giv him some liquor to get the horrors off, and by-and-by he quieted.‘Oh, she’s gone!Has her keeper been for her?’ he says.‘Yes,’ says Compeyson’s wife.‘Did you tell him to lock her and bar her in?’‘Yes.’‘And to take that ugly thing away from her?’‘Yes, yes, all right.’‘You’re a good creetur,’ he says, ‘don’t leave me, whatever you do, and thank you!’”"
"“他安安稳稳地睡着了，快到五点钟的时候，他尖叫一声，跳了起来，嘴里喊着：‘她来了！她又把裹尸布带来了。她把它打开了。她从墙角走过来了。她走到床前了。抓住我，你们快抓住我——一人一边——别让她的裹尸布碰到我。哈！这回她没碰到我。别让她把裹尸布罩到我肩上。别让她抬起我，把裹尸布罩到我身上。她把我抬起来了。放我下来！’然后他身子用力往上一顶，死了。”","“He rested pretty quiet till it might want a few minutes of five, and then he starts up with a scream, and screams out, ‘Here she is!She’s got the shroud again.She’s unfolding it.She’s coming out of the corner.She’s coming to the bed.Hold me, both on you—one of each side—don’t let her touch me with it.Hah! she missed me that time.Don’t let her throw it over my shoulders.Don’t let her lift me up to get it round me.She’s lifting me up.Keep me down!’Then he lifted himself up hard, and was dead.”"
"“康培生对此事处之泰然，他认为他的死对双方都是个解脱。他和我接下来就有的忙了，他做的第一件事就是让我对着我自己的书发誓（这个狡猾的家伙）——就是这本袖珍黑皮书，好孩子，就是我让你朋友用它发誓的书。”","“Compeyson took it easy as a good riddance for both sides.Him and me was soon busy, and first he swore me (being ever artful) on my own book—this here little black book, dear boy, what I swore your comrade on.”"
"“至于康培生出主意，然后由我去办的那些事情，我就不说了——要说得说一个星期呢——我简单跟你们说吧，好孩子，还有皮普的朋友，我陷入了那个人的罗网，成了他的黑奴。我总是欠他的债，总是听他摆布，总是为他干活，总是陷入麻烦之中。他年纪比我小，可鬼点子多得很，还有学问，他比我强几百几千倍，而且心肠硬得很。那时我跟我老婆闹不和——不提这个了！我不想把她搅和进来——”","“Not to go into the things that Compeyson planned, and I done—which ’ud take a week—I’ll simply say to you, dear boy, and Pip’s comrade, that that man got me into such nets as made me his black slave.I was always in debt to him, always under his thumb, always a-working, always a-getting into danger.He was younger than me, but he’d got craft, and he’d got learning, and he overmatched me five hundred times told and no mercy.My Missis as I had the hard time wi’—Stop though!I ain’t brought her in—”"
"他慌张地环顾了一下四周，好像这段往事不知讲到哪里了，然后把脸转向火炉，双手放在膝盖上，摊得更开了，又把手从膝盖上拿开了又放上去。","He looked about him in a confused way, as if he had lost his place in the book of his remembrance; and he turned his face to the fire, and spread his hands broader on his knees, and lifted them off and put them on again."
"“没必要再多说什么了。”他说，又一次环顾了一下四周。“跟康培生混的日子是我一辈子最难熬的日子，只说这一句就够了。我有没有跟你们说过，跟康培生在一起的时候，有一次我单独受过审，因为行为不端的罪名？”","“There ain’t no need to go into it,” he said, looking round once more.“The time wi’ Compeyson was a’most as hard a time as ever I had; that said, all’s said.Did I tell you as I was tried, alone, for misdemeanor, while with Compeyson?”"
"我回答他说没有。","I answered, No."
"“好吧！”他说，“有过那么一次，而且罪名成立。至于受到嫌疑而被捕，四五年里有过两三次，幸亏每次都证据不足。到最后，我和康培生两个都犯了重罪——罪名是拿偷来的钱投入市场流通——还有其他几个罪名。康培生对我说：‘各找律师，不再联系。’他就说了这么多。我那时穷得叮当响，把所有衣服都卖了，除了身上那件，这才请到贾格尔斯给我辩护。","“Well!” he said, “I was, and got convicted.As to took up on suspicion, that was twice or three times in the four or five year that it lasted; but evidence was wanting.At last, me and Compeyson was both committed for felony—on a charge of putting stolen notes in circulation—and there was other charges behind.Compeyson says to me, ‘Separate defenses, no communication,’ and that was all.And I was so miserable poor, that I sold all the clothes I had, except what hung on my back, afore I could get Jaggers."
"“我们两个都被推到了被告席，这时，我首先注意到康培生的打扮，多像个绅士啊，一头卷发，一身黑衣，白色手帕，再看看我，多像个普普通通的可怜虫啊。一开庭，证据一摆出来，我就预感到了罪证对我有多重，对他有多轻。后来证人出庭，他们把我说成是主犯，他们还发誓，说钱都是交到我手上。他们还说事情都是我的主意，好处都是我得的。后来辩护律师说话了，我把事实看得更清楚了，律师为康培生辩护说：‘法官大人、先生们，现在你们面前并排站着两个人呢，你们可以仔细分析一下，年纪轻的这一位，受过良好的教育，这一点应该考虑进去。年纪大的这一位，没有受过良好的教育，这一点也应该考虑进去。年纪轻的这一位，这样的罪行几乎跟他扯不上关系，只是有嫌疑而已。年纪大的这一位，同这些罪行关系很大。如果这件事只有一个人与此有关，会是哪一个呢，如果与两个人都有关，哪一个情节更严重呢？对此你们会有怀疑吗？’他还说了一些类似的话。说到人品，康培生上过学，他的同学不是在这里做官，就是在那里得意，他的证人都是这样那样的俱乐部和社团里的熟人，总不至于说他的坏话吧？而我呢，以前就受过审，在拘留所、监狱里进进出出的，哪一个不认识我？说到言谈，康培生跟他们说话的时候，时不时地用白手帕蒙着脸——哼！话里面还夹着诗句——而我呢，我只能说：‘先生们，我旁边这个人是个十足的无赖。’陪审团判决结果出来了，念在康培生品行端正，只是交友不慎，并且提供一切线索检举揭发我的份上，建议对他宽大处理，而我呢，除了判我有罪，他们一句话也没多说。我对康培生说：‘出了法庭，我要打烂你这张脸！’康培生请求法官保护他，法官就派了两个人把我们两个隔开。判决结果出来了，他判了七年，而我判了十四年，法官对他感到惋惜，认为他本来很有前途的。而我呢，法官把我看做一个穷凶极恶的惯犯，只可能越变越坏。”","“When we was put in the dock, I noticed first of all what a gentleman Compeyson looked, wi’ his curly hair and his black clothes and his white pocket-handkercher, and what a common sort of a wretch I looked.When the prosecution opened and the evidence was put short, aforehand, I noticed how heavy it all bore on me, and how light on him.When the evidence was giv in the box, I noticed how it was always me that had come for’ard, and could be swore to, how it was always me that the money had been paid to, how it was always me that had seemed to work the thing and get the profit.But, when the defense come on, then I see the plan plainer; for, says the counselor for Compeyson, ‘My lord and gentlemen, here you has afore you, side by side, two persons as your eyes can separate wide; one, the younger, well brought up, who will be spoke to as such; one, the elder, ill brought up, who will be spoke to as such; one, the younger, seldom if ever seen in these here transactions, and only suspected; t’other, the elder, always seen in ’em and always wi’his guilt brought home.Can you doubt, if there is but one in it, which is the one, and, if there is two in it, which is much the worst one?’And such-like.And when it come to character, warn’t it Compeyson as had been to the school, and warn’t it his schoolfellows as was in this position and in that, and warn’t it him as had been know’d by witnesses in such clubs and societies, and nowt to his disadvantage?And warn’t it me as had been tried afore, and as had been know’d up hill and down dale in Bridewells and Lock-Ups?And when it come to speech-making, warn’t it Compeyson as could speak to ’em wi’ his face dropping every now and then into his white pocket-handkercher—ah! and wi’verses in his speech, too—and warn’t it me as could only say, ‘Gentlemen, this man at my side is a most precious rascal’?And when the verdict come, warn’t it Compeyson as was recommended to mercy on account of good character and bad company, and giving up all the information he could agen me, and warn’t it me as got never a word but Guilty?And when I says to Compeyson, ‘Once out of this court, I’ll smash that face of yourn!’ ain’t it Compeyson as prays the Judge to be protected, and gets two turnkeys stood betwixt us?And when we’re sentenced, ain’t it him as gets seven year, and me fourteen, and ain’t it him as the Judge is sorry for, because he might a done so well, and ain’t it me as the Judge perceives to be a old offender of wiolent passion, likely to come to worse?”"
"说到这里他激动得难以自控，但他忍住了，用力喘了两三口气，吞了几口唾沫，向我伸出手来，想让我安心似的说：“我不会再这么粗俗了，好孩子！”","He had worked himself into a state of great excitement, but he checked it, took two or three short breaths, swallowed as often, and stretching out his hand towards me said, in a reassuring manner, “I ain’t a-going to be low, dear boy!”"
"他激动得不行，便掏出手帕，擦了擦脸、头、脖子和手，才接着往下说：","He had so heated himself that he took out his handkerchief and wiped his face and head and neck and hands, before he could go on."
"“我对康培生说过，我要打烂他那张脸。我发誓要是我做不到，就让上帝打烂我的脸！我们被关在同一条监狱船上，我真想揍他，但一直找不到机会下手。终于找到个机会，我到他身后，朝他脸上打了一拳，把他打得转了个身，又在他脸上狠狠地打了一拳，正好被人看见，把我给抓起来了。他们把我关进船上的暗室，对我这样一个会游泳又会潜水的、住惯了暗室的人来说，暗室根本关不住我。我逃到了岸上，躲在墓地里，就在羡慕那些躺在地下一了百了的人的时候，我第一次看见了你，我的孩子！”","“I had said to Compeyson that I’d smash that face of his, and I swore Lord smash mine!We was in the same prison-ship, but I couldn’t get at him for long, though I tried.At last I come behind him and hit him on the cheek to turn him round and get a smashing one at him, when I was seen and seized.The black-hole of that ship warn’t a strong one, to a judge of black-holes that could swim and dive.I escaped to the shore, and I was a hiding among the graves there, envying them as was in ’em and all over, when I first see my boy!”"
"他满怀深情地望了我一眼，本来我还挺可怜他的，这一望让我对他又厌恶起来了。","He regarded me with a look of affection that made him almost abhorrent to me again, though I had felt great pity for him."
"“我的孩子，我当时从你的话里知道康培生也逃到沼泽地里来了。我敢说，我多半相信他逃出来是因为怕了我，想要躲开我，他不知道我已经逃到岸上来了。我找到了他。我打烂了他的脸。‘现在，’我说，‘我豁出去拼了命也要把你拖回监狱船上去。’要不是官兵来了，在当时的情况下，我本来真的可以一把揪住他的头发，拖着他，游回监狱船上去。”","“By my boy, I was giv to understand as Compeyson was out on them marshes too.Upon my soul, I half believe he escaped in his terror, to get quit of me, not knowing it was me as had got ashore.I hunted him down.I smashed his face.‘And now,’ says I ‘as the worst thing I can do, caring nothing for myself, I’ll drag you back.’And I’d have swum off, towing him by the hair, if it had come to that, and I’d a got him aboard without the soldiers.”"
"“自然，这事最后又是他得了便宜——他的品行好嘛。他说他逃跑是因为被我吓掉了魂，以为我要谋杀他，结果他的罪判得很轻。而我又一次戴上了手铐、脚镣，被送上法庭，判了终身流放。好孩子、皮普的朋友，我既然到这里来了，就不在乎什么终身流放了。”","“Of course he’d much the best of it to the last—his character was so good.He had escaped when he was made half-wild by me and my murderous intentions; and his punishment was light.I was put in irons, brought to trial again, and sent for life.I didn’t stop for life, dear boy and Pip’s comrade, being here.”"
"他又像刚才那样掏出手帕擦了擦汗，然后慢慢从口袋里掏出一团烟草，从纽扣孔里拔出烟管，慢慢把烟草塞进烟管里，开始抽起烟来。","He wiped himself again, as he had done before, and then slowly took his tangle of tobacco from his pocket, and plucked his pipe from his button-hole, and slowly filled it, and began to smoke."
"“他死了吗？”沉默了一会儿之后，我问他。","“Is he dead?” I asked, after a silence."
"“谁死了，好孩子？”","“Is who dead, dear boy?”"
"“康培生。”","“Compeyson.”"
"“他倒是希望我死了，如果他还活着的话，这一点可以肯定。”他露出满脸的愤怒之情，“我再也没听说过他的消息了。”","“He hopes I am, if he’s alive, you may be sure,” with a fierce look.“I never heerd no more of him.”"
"赫伯特在一本书的封面上用铅笔写了些什么。趁普罗维斯站在那里抽烟，眼睛盯着火炉的时候，他悄悄把书递给我，我一看，上面写着：","Herbert had been writing with his pencil in the cover of a book.He softly pushed the book over to me, as Provis stood smoking with his eyes on the fire, and I read in it:"
"“郝维仙小姐的弟弟就叫阿瑟。康培生就是那个声称是郝维仙小姐情人的家伙。”","“Young Havisham’s name was Arthur.Compeyson is the man who professed to be Miss Havisham’s lover.”"
"我合上书，朝赫伯特微微点了点头，然后把书放到一边，我们两个都没有说话，目光都投向了普罗维斯，看着他站在火炉旁抽烟。","I shut the book and nodded slightly to Herbert, and put the book by; but we neither of us said anything, and both looked at Provis as he stood smoking by the fire."
"第四十三章","Chapter 43"
"我何必要停下来自问，我这样害怕和普罗维斯亲近，在多大程度上是因为埃斯特拉的缘故？我何必要一路走走停停，将两种心境比来比去？正是因为这种心态，想我当初参观监狱出来时，把身上的气息去掉后才敢去驿站接埃斯特拉；也是因为这种心态，我如今又想着傲慢又美丽的埃斯特拉与我窝藏的那个潜逃回国的囚犯之间有着天壤之别。道路不会因此平坦一些，结局不会因此美满一些，他不会因此获救，我也不会因此减罪。","Why should I pause to ask how much of my shrinking from Provis might be traced to Estella?Why should I loiter on my road, to compare the state of mind in which I had tried to rid myself of the stain of the prison before meeting her at the coach-office, with the state of mind in which I now reflected on the abyss between Estella in her pride and beauty, and the returned transport whom I harboured?The road would be none the smoother for it, the end would be none the better for it, he would not be helped, nor I extenuated."
"听了他这番叙述，我脑子里又产生了一种新的恐惧，或者说，这种恐惧早已有之，只是他这番叙述使它更加具体、更加明了了。如果康培生还活着，发现他已回国的话，后果不堪设想。康培生对他怕得要死，这一点我比他们俩谁都清楚。康培生既然是像他所说的这样一个人，那么，他一定会去检举揭发，安全地把自己这个可怕的死对头除掉，我想象不出康培生对此会有半点犹豫。","A new fear had been engendered in my mind by his narrative; or rather, his narrative had given form and purpose to the fear that was already there.If Compeyson were alive and should discover his return, I could hardly doubt the consequence.That, Compeyson stood in mortal fear of him, neither of the two could know much better than I; and that, any such man as that man had been described to be, would hesitate to release himself for good from a dreaded enemy by the safe means of becoming an informer, was scarcely to be imagined."
"我从来没有，也永远不会——至少我是这么打算的——向普罗维斯提起埃斯特拉的。不过，我跟赫伯特说了，要是我得以顺利出国，我一定要在走之前见见埃斯特拉和郝维仙小姐。这是普罗维斯跟我们讲述他的生平的那晚，在他走后只剩下我和赫伯特的时候，我跟他说的。我打定主意第二天去里士满，第二天我真的去了。","Never had I breathed, and never would I breathe—or so I resolved—a word of Estella to Provis.But, I said to Herbert that before I could go abroad, I must see both Estella and Miss Havisham.This was when we were left alone on the night of the day when Provis told us his story.I resolved to go out to Richmond next day, and I went."
"我一到布兰德利夫人家门口，埃斯特拉的女仆就告诉我说，埃斯特拉到乡下去了。我问她去哪里了。她说沙提斯庄园，跟往常一样。跟往常不一样，我说，因为她以前没有一次不是我陪同去的，我问她什么时候回来。女仆的回答吞吞吐吐，让我更加疑惑不解，她说，估计她回来也只呆一会儿。她的回答让我一头雾水，我只知道她本来就是要让我一头雾水，我又一次扫兴而归。","On my presenting myself at Mrs. Brandley’s, Estella’s maid was called to tell that Estella had gone into the country.Where?To Satis House, as usual.Not as usual, I said, for she had never yet gone there without me; when was she coming back?There was an air of reservation in the answer which increased my perplexity, and the answer was, that her maid believed she was only coming back at all for a little while.I could make nothing of this, except that it was meant that I should make nothing of it, and I went home again in complete discomfiture."
"普罗维斯回去后（我通常都会送他回去，通常都会注意留心四周动静），我跟赫伯特夜间又做了一次商谈，最后商定好了，在我从郝维仙小姐家回来之前，出国的事一个字都不能跟他提。与此同时，赫伯特和我分头考虑怎么跟他说最好，是编个借口，说我们怀疑他被人盯上了，还是说我还没出过国，应该出去见见世面。我们都知道，不管我怎么说，普罗维斯都会答应的。我们一致认为，不能让他冒着风险在这里继续呆下去。","Another night-consultation with Herbert after Provis was gone home (I always took him home, and always looked well about me), led us to the conclusion that nothing should be said about going abroad until I came back from Miss Havisham’s.In the meantime, Herbert and I were to consider separately what it would be best to say; whether we should devise any pretence of being afraid that he was under suspicious observation; or whether I, who had never yet been abroad, should propose an expedition.We both knew that I had but to propose anything, and he would consent.We agreed that his remaining many days in his present hazard was not to be thought of."
"第二天，我捏造了一个卑鄙的借口，说我跟乔约好了，要到乡下去看他。对于乔这个人，还有乔这个名字，我可是什么卑鄙的事情都做得出来了。我叮嘱普罗维斯，在我外出的这段时间里要万分小心，赫伯特会代替我来照看他。我计划只在外面过一夜，等我回来了，就满足他做一名更气派的绅士，他对这点已经变得迫不及待了。当时我想到，后来发现赫伯特也和我想的一样，那就是要把他弄出国，最好的理由是——要做一个更气派的绅士，就需要出国购置行头，买这买那。","Next day, I had the meanness to feign that I was under a binding promise to go down to Joe; but I was capable of almost any meanness towards Joe or his name.Provis was to be strictly careful while I was gone, and Herbert was to take the charge of him that I had taken.I was to be absent only one night, and, on my return, the gratification of his impatience for my starting as a gentleman on a greater scale, was to be begun.It occurred to me then, and as I afterwards found to Herbert also, that he might be best got away across the water, on that pretence—as, to make purchases, or the like."
"在为郝维仙小姐府上之行扫清障碍后，我一大早天还没亮就动身启程了，赶上了早班马车，来到了开阔的乡间小路。这时天光渐渐亮了，我身上裹着的衣服上打满了像云一样的补丁，如雾气一样潮湿。马车走走停停，我在车上瑟瑟发抖，抽噎不止，寒碜得像个乞丐。马车顶着毛毛细雨，赶到了“蓝野猪”饭店，只见大门口出来一个人，手里拿着一根牙签，看着马车，这个人正是本特利·德鲁莫尔！","Having thus cleared the way for my expedition to Miss Havisham’s, I set off by the early morning coach before it was yet light, and was out on the open country-road when the day came creeping on, halting and whimpering and shivering, and wrapped in patches of cloud and rags of mist, like a beggar.When we drove up to the Blue Boar after a drizzly ride, whom should I see come out under the gateway, toothpick in hand, to look at the coach, but Bentley Drummle!"
"他假装没看见我，我也假装没看见他。我们装得一点也不像，因为我们一起走进咖啡室，他刚用完早餐，而我刚点好我的早餐。在镇上看见他真让我恶心，他为什么到那里，我清楚得很。","As he pretended not to see me, I pretended not to see him.It was a very lame pretence on both sides; the lamer, because we both went into the coffee-room, where he had just finished his breakfast, and where I ordered mine.It was poisonous to me to see him in the town, for I very well knew why he had come there."
"他站在火炉旁边，而我坐在桌前，拿起一份早就过期了的报纸读了起来，当地新闻已经模糊地难以辨认了，倒是外来的东西，像咖啡呀、泡菜呀、鱼酱呀、肉汁呀、融化了的黄油呀、葡萄酒呀之类的，弄得报纸上到处都是，就像皮肤上形状不规则的麻疹。德鲁莫尔在火炉前站着，我越看越生气，于是站起身来，决定不能让他一个人独享炉火。我走到炉边想去拔火，可要拿拔火棒就不得不把手伸到他大腿后面，我仍旧装作不认识他。","Pretending to read a smeary newspaper long out of date, which had nothing half so legible in its local news, as the foreign matter of coffee, pickles, fish-sauces, gravy, melted butter, and wine, with which it was sprinkled all over, as if it had taken the measles in a highly irregular form, I sat at my table while he stood before the fire.By degrees it became an enormous injury to me that he stood before the fire, and I got up, determined to have my share of it.I had to put my hand behind his legs for the poker when I went up to the fire-place to stir the fire, but still pretended not to know him."
"“怎么看见我连个招呼都不打？”德鲁莫尔说。","“Is this a cut?” said Mr. Drummle."
"“哎呀！”我手里握着拔火棒，说，“是你呀？你好吗？我还纳闷是谁呢，在这里挡着火。”","“Oh!” said I, poker in hand; “it’s you, is it?How do you do?I was wondering who it was, who kept the fire off.”"
"我一边说一边使劲拨着炉火，拨完炉火之后，便张开肩头，背靠炉火，和德鲁莫尔并排站在一起。","With that, I poked tremendously, and having done so, planted myself side by side with Mr. Drummle, my shoulders squared and my back to the fire."
"“你刚来吗？”德鲁莫尔一边问一边用肩膀顶了我一下，把我顶开了一点。","“You have just come down?” said Mr. Drummle, edging me a little away with his shoulder."
"“是的。”我一边说一边用肩膀也顶了他一下，把他也顶开了一点。","“Yes,” said I, edging him a little away with my shoulder."
"“这地方真是糟糕透顶。”德鲁莫尔说，“是你老家吧，我想？”","“Beastly place,” said Drummle.—“Your part of the country, I think?”"
"“是的。”我没有否认，“我听说这里跟你老家什罗普郡非常像。”","“Yes,” I assented.“I am told it’s very like your Shropshire.”"
"“一点也不像。”德鲁莫尔说。","“Not in the least like it,” said Drummle."
"说到这里，德鲁莫尔看看他自己的靴子，我也看看我自己的，然后他看看我的，我也看看他的。","Here Mr. Drummle looked at his boots, and I looked at mine, and then Mr. Drummle looked at my boots, and I looked at his."
"“你来这里很久了吗？”我问他，打定主意要守在炉前，寸火不让。","“Have you been here long?” I asked, determined not to yield an inch of the fire."
"“来很久了，都呆烦了。”德鲁莫尔回答我说。他假装打了个呵欠，也下定决心寸火不让。","“Long enough to be tired of it,” returned Drummle, pretending to yawn, but equally determined."
"“你打算在这里呆很久吗？”","“Do you stay here long?”"
"“难说，”德鲁莫尔说，“你呢？”","“Can’t say,” answered Mr. Drummle.“Do you?”"
"“难说。”我答道。","“Can’t say,” said I."
"我当时只觉得全身的血液都沸腾了，心想，如果德鲁莫尔的肩膀再往我这里挪一丁点的话，我就把他扔出窗外，同样，如果我的肩膀再往他那里挪一丁点的话，德鲁莫尔也会把我扔到旁边的包厢里去的。他吹了几声口哨。我也吹了几声。","I felt here, through a tingling in my blood, that if Mr. Drummle’s shoulder had claimed another hair’s breadth of room, I should have jerked him into the window; equally, that if my own shoulder had urged a similar claim, Mr. Drummle would have jerked me into the nearest box.He whistled a little.So did I."
"“我看这附近有好大一块沼泽地吧？”德鲁莫尔问。","“Large tract of marshes about here, I believe?” said Drummle."
"“有。那又怎样？”我问。","“Yes. What of that?” said I."
"德鲁莫尔看了看我，又看了看我的靴子，然后说：“哦！”然后笑了一声。","Mr. Drummle looked at me, and then at my boots, and then said, “Oh!” and laughed. "
"“你觉得这有趣吗，德鲁莫尔先生？”","“Are you amused, Mr. Drummle?”"
"“不，”他说，“不是很有趣。我要骑马出去转转。我的意思是去沼泽地看看，找点乐子。听说，那边有几个偏远的村子。几家新奇的小酒店——几家铁匠铺——这一类的。服务员！”","“No,” said he, “not particularly.I am going out for a ride in the saddle.I mean to explore those marshes for amusement.Out-of-the-way villages there, they tell me.Curious little public-houses—and smithies—and that.Waiter!”"
"“来了，先生。”","“Yes, sir.”"
"“我的马备好了吗？”","“Is that horse of mine ready?”"
"“牵到门口等着了，先生。”","“Brought round to the door, sir.”"
"“嗨。听我说，伙计。小姐今天不想骑马，天公不作美。”","“I say.Look here, you sir.The lady won’t ride today; the weather won’t do.”"
"“好的，先生。”","“Very good, sir.”"
"“还有，我不在这里吃午饭了，我要去小姐那里吃。”","“And I don’t dine, because I’m going to dine at the lady’s.”"
"“好的，先生。”","“Very good, sir.”"
"说完，德鲁莫尔瞟了我一眼，他脸上长着一个满是垂肉的双下巴，还露出一副得意洋洋的表情。他这副嘴脸让我心里很受刺激，这个蠢笨的家伙激怒了我，我真想把他夹到胳膊底下，一把丢进火炉里（故事书里的强盗就是这么处置老太婆的）。","Then, Drummle glanced at me, with an insolent triumph on his great-jowled face that cut me to the heart, dull as he was, and so exasperated me, that I felt inclined to take him in my arms (as the robber in the story-book is said to have taken the old lady), and seat him on the fire."
"有一点我们俩都很清楚，那就是，除非有人过来解围，要不然我们谁都不肯让步，谁都不肯离开火炉一步。我们就在那里站着，双方都摆好了对阵的架势，肩碰着肩，脚顶着脚，双手背在身后，寸步不让。从门口就能看见他的马，正站在毛毛雨中整装待发。我的早餐端上桌了，德鲁莫尔的残羹冷炙也收拾干净了。服务员请我过去用餐，我点了点头，但我们俩始终站在原处僵持不下。","One thing was manifest to both of us, and that was, that until relief came, neither of us could relinquish the fire.There we stood, well squared up before it, shoulder to shoulder and foot to foot, with our hands behind us, not budging an inch.The horse was visible outside in the drizzle at the door, my breakfast was put on the table, Drummle’s was cleared away, the waiter invited me to begin, I nodded, we both stood our ground."
"“你后来又去过‘林中鸟’俱乐部吗？”德鲁莫尔问。","“Have you been to the Grove since?” said Drummle."
"“没有，”我说，“上次我已经对那些‘林中鸟’领教够了。”","“No,” said I, “I had quite enough of the Finches the last time I was there.”"
"“是我们意见不合的那次吗？”","“Was that when we had a difference of opinion?”"
"“是的。”我简慢地答了他一句。","“Yes,” I replied, very shortly."
"“得了，得了！他们那么容易就让你下了台。”德鲁莫尔冷笑着说，“你不该那样发火的。”","“Come, come!They let you off easily enough,” sneered Drummle.“You shouldn’t have lost your temper.”"
"“德鲁莫尔先生，”我说，“这件事还轮不到你发表高见。就算我发火（我不是承认我那一次发了火），我也不会摔杯子扔碗的。”","“Mr. Drummle,” said I, “you are not competent to give advice on that subject.When I lose my temper (not that I admit having done so on that occasion), I don’t throw glasses.”"
"“我会。”德鲁莫尔说。","“I do,” said Drummle."
"我满腔的怒火越来越难以抑制，我瞥了他一两眼，说：","After glancing at him once or twice, in an increased state of smouldering ferocity, I said:"
"“德鲁莫尔先生，今天的谈话不是我挑起的，我也不认为这是一次愉快的谈话。”","“Mr. Drummle, I did not seek this conversation, and I don’t think it an agreeable one.”"
"“当然不是，”他傲慢地转过头说，“我一点也不认为这是一次愉快的谈话。”","“I am sure it’s not,” said he, superciliously over his shoulder; “I don’t think anything about it.”"
"“既然这样，”我接着说，“请允许我这么说，我建议我们以后不要再交谈什么了。”","“And therefore,” I went on, “with your leave, I will suggest that we hold no kind of communication in future.”"
"“我正是这么想的，”德鲁莫尔说，“我本来该提出这个建议的，或者说直接这么做——更确切地说——根本用不着建议。你可不要发火。发什么火呢，你输得还不够吗？”","“Quite my opinion,” said Drummle, “and what I should have suggested myself, or done—more likely—without suggesting.But don’t lose your temper.Haven’t you lost enough without that?”"
"“你什么意思，先生？”","“What do you mean, sir?”"
"“服务员！”德鲁莫尔喊了一声，作为对我的问题的回答。","“Waiter!” said Drummle, by way of answering me."
"服务员又过来了。","The waiter reappeared."
"“听着，伙计。小姐今天不想骑马，我去小姐那里吃午饭，你听清楚了吧？”","“Look here, you sir.You quite understand that the young lady don’t ride today, and that I dine at the young lady’s?”"
"“听清楚了，先生！”","“Quite so, sir!”"
"服务员伸手摸了摸我的茶壶，很快就冷了，他用恳求的目光看了我一眼，然后就出去了。德鲁莫尔小心翼翼地从口袋里掏出一根雪茄，咬掉了烟头，生怕肩膀从我这移开了，但没有要走的迹象。我虽然怒不可遏、怒火中烧，但我觉得我们再说几句就不可避免地要谈到埃斯特拉，我不能容忍他说出这个名字，所以我死死地盯着对面的墙壁，好像屋里没有其他人一样，强迫自己一言不发。很难说我们还要这样可笑地僵持多久，直到最后来了三个富农——我估计是服务员故意打发他们进来的——一进咖啡室就解开大衣纽扣，搓着手，直往壁炉这边走来，争先恐后地要来取暖，我们这才不得不让开。","When the waiter had felt my fast cooling tea-pot with the palm of his hand, and had looked imploringly at me, and had gone out, Drummle, careful not to move the shoulder next me, took a cigar from his pocket and bit the end off, but showed no sign of stirring.Choking and boiling as I was, I felt that we could not go a word further, without introducing Estella’s name, which I could not endure to hear him utter; and therefore I looked stonily at the opposite wall, as if there were no one present, and forced myself to silence.How long we might have remained in this ridiculous position it is impossible to say, but for the incursion of three thriving farmers—led on by the waiter, I think—who came into the coffee-room unbuttoning their great-coats and rubbing their hands, and before whom, as they charged at the fire, we were obliged to give way."
"我透过窗子看见他抓住了马的鬃毛，野蛮又笨拙地爬上了马背，马匹身子一歪，倒走了几步。我以为他走了，可他又回来了，叫人给他嘴里的雪茄点上火，他刚才走的时候忘了。然后来了一个穿灰褐色衣服的人，手里拿着火给他点烟——我说不出他是从哪里冒出来的：是从饭店院子里出来的，还是从大街上来的，还是从其他什么地方来的——德鲁莫尔从马背上俯下身，点着了雪茄，猛地把头转向咖啡室这边，大笑了一声，而这个肩头低垂、满头乱发的人背对着我，他的背影让我想起了奥立克。","I saw him through the window, seizing his horse’s mane, and mounting in his blundering brutal manner, and sidling and backing away.I thought he was gone, when he came back, calling for a light for the cigar in his mouth, which he had forgotten.A man in a dustcolored dress appeared with what was wanted—I could not have said from where: whether from the inn yard, or the street, or where not—and as Drummle leaned down from the saddle and lighted his cigar and laughed, with a jerk of his head towards the coffee-room windows, the slouching shoulders and ragged hair of this man, whose back was towards me, reminded me of Orlick."
"我当时烦闷无比，哪有心情去想那个人是不是奥立克。早餐我也没有心情吃，我洗了洗脸和手，想把旅途的风尘都洗掉，随后就直往那座难以从记忆中抹去的古老宅子赶去，心想，要是我从来没进过这座宅子，也从来没有见过它，那该有多好啊。","Too heavily out of sorts to care much at the time whether it were he or no, or after all to touch the breakfast, I washed the weather and the journey from my face and hands, and went out to the memorable old house that it would have been so much the better for me never to have entered, never to have seen."
"第四十四章","Chapter 44"
"在那间放着梳妆台、墙上点着蜡烛的房间里，我看见了郝维仙小姐和埃斯特拉，郝维仙小姐坐在火炉边的长靠椅上，埃斯特拉坐在她脚边的坐垫上。埃斯特拉在编织什么东西，郝维仙小姐在一旁看着。我进来的时候，她们抬起头看见了我，察觉到我神色有些不对。她们交换了一下眼色，我是从这一点推断出来的。","In the room where the dressing-table stood, and where the wax candles burnt on the wall, I found Miss Havisham and Estella; Miss Havisham seated on a settee near the fire, and Estella on a cushion at her feet.Estella was knitting, and Miss Havisham was looking on.They both raised their eyes as I went in, and both saw an alteration in me.I derived that, from the look they interchanged."
"“皮普，”郝维仙小姐问，“什么风把你吹到这里来了？”","“And what wind,” said Miss Havisham, “blows you here, Pip?”"
"虽然她镇定自若地看着我，但我看得出她很困惑。埃斯特拉停下了手里的活，望了我一眼，然后继续她的编织。我想我能从她手指的动作里看出来，就跟她打哑谜告诉我一样明了，她已经猜到了，我知道真正的恩主是谁了。","Though she looked steadily at me, I saw that she was rather confused.Estella, pausing a moment in her knitting with her eyes upon me, and then going on, I fancied that I read in the action of her fingers, as plainly as if she had told me in the dumb alphabet, that she perceived I had discovered my real benefactor."
"“郝维仙小姐，”我说，“我昨天到里士满去了一趟，想找埃斯特拉说句话，结果发现不知什么风把她吹到这里了，我就跟着来了。”","“Miss Havisham,” said I, “I went to Richmond yesterday, to speak to Estella; and finding that some wind had blown her here, I followed.”"
"郝维仙小姐三番五次示意我坐下，我在梳妆台旁的一把椅子上坐下了，以前经常看见她坐在这把椅子上。我脚边和四周都是乱七八糟的陈年旧物。在那天，这个位子好像是专门为我准备的。","Miss Havisham motioning to me for the third or fourth time to sit down, I took the chair by the dressing-table, which I had often seen her occupy.With all that ruin at my feet and about me, it seemed a natural place for me, that day."
"“郝维仙小姐，我打算跟埃斯特拉说的话，现在要当着您的面说——只一会儿就好。您听了这话不会吃惊，也不会不高兴。我现在不幸的处境，正是您所想见到的。”","“What I had to say to Estella, Miss Havisham, I will say before you, presently—in a few moments.It will not surprise you, it will not displease you.I am as unhappy as you can ever have meant me to be.”"
"郝维仙小姐仍然不动声色地盯着我。我可以从埃斯特拉手指的动作看出，她在听我说话：但她没有抬头。","Miss Havisham continued to look steadily at me.I could see in the action of Estella’s fingers as they worked, that she attended to what I said: but she did not look up."
"“我知道我的恩主是谁了。这个发现不是一件幸事，对于我的名声、地位、财产，对于我的一切，都不会有什么好处。由于某些原因，这事我只能说这么多了。这不是我的秘密，而是另一个人的秘密。”","“I have found out who my patron is.It is not a fortunate discovery, and is not likely ever to enrich me in reputation, station, fortune, anything.There are reasons why I must say no more of that.It is not my secret, but another’s.”"
"我沉默了一会儿，看看埃斯特拉，想着接下去该怎么说，郝维仙小姐重复了我的话：“这不是你的秘密，而是另一个人的秘密。是吗？”","As I was silent for a while, looking at Estella and considering how to go on, Miss Havisham repeated, “It is not your secret, but another’s.Well?”"
"“郝维仙小姐，当您第一次让人把我带到这里来的时候，我还是那边村子里的孩子，我要是从来没离开过村子该多好啊。我认为我到这里来，跟其他可能被您选中的小男孩一样——只是您雇来做您的仆人，满足您的某种需求或者说奇想，是吗？”","“When you first caused me to be brought here, Miss Havisham; when I belonged to the village over yonder, that I wish I had never left; I suppose I did really come here, as any other chance boy might have come—as a kind of servant, to gratify a want or a whim, and to be paid for it?”"
"“唉，皮普，”郝维仙小姐镇静自若地点了点头，说，“是这样的。”","“Ay, Pip,” replied Miss Havisham, steadily nodding her head; “you did.”"
"“那么贾格尔斯先生——”","“And that Mr. Jaggers—”"
"“贾格尔斯先生，”郝维仙小姐语气坚定地打断了我的话，“他跟这件事没有关系，他对这件事一无所知。他是我的律师，同时也是你恩主的律师，这只是一种巧合。很多人都和他有这种关系，巧合是很容易发生的。不管怎样，巧合发生了，这是任何人都无法控制的。”","“Mr. Jaggers,” said Miss Havisham, taking me up in a firm tone, “had nothing to do with it, and knew nothing of it.His being my lawyer, and his being the lawyer of your patron, is a coincidence.He holds the same relation towards numbers of people, and it might easily arise.Be that as it may, it did arise, and was not brought about by any one.”"
"任何人从她憔悴的脸上都可以看出，她的话里没有隐瞒什么，也没有回避什么。","Any one might have seen in her haggard face that there was no suppression or evasion so far."
"“可是我一直以来都陷入了误解当中，至少是您误导我的吧？”我说。","“But when I fell into the mistake I have so long remained in, at least you led me on?” said I."
"“是的，”她又一次镇静自若地点了点头答道，“是我误导了你。”","“Yes,” she returned, again nodding, steadily, “I let you go on.”"
"“您这么做是仁慈的吗？”","“Was that kind?”"
"“我是什么人，”郝维仙小姐喊了起来，边喊边用拐杖敲着地板，突然变得怒不可遏，埃斯特拉抬起头惊讶地看着她，“我是什么人，上帝呀，我为什么要仁慈？”","“Who am I,” cried Miss Havisham, striking her stick upon the floor and flashing into wrath so suddenly that Estella glanced up at her in surprise, “who am I, for God’s sake, that I should be kind?”"
"我那句话并没有多少埋怨她的意思，我也不是有意的。她怒气发完后坐在那里沉思，我跟她解释了一下。","It was a weak complaint to have made, and I had not meant to make it.I told her so, as she sat brooding after this outburst."
"“得了，得了，得了！”她说，“还有什么要说的吗？”","“Well, well, well!” she said.“What else?”"
"“我以前到这里来，您总是给我慷慨的报酬。”我为了平息她的怒气，说道+B68，“我问这些问题只是我自己想弄清楚情况。我下面想问的是出于另一个目的（我希望这与我个人的关系小些）。您是利用我的误解，郝维仙小姐，来惩罚——或者说欺骗——您那些自私自利的亲戚吧？不管您用哪个词来形容您的意图都行，只要没有冒犯到您。”","“I was liberally paid for my old attendance here,” I said, to soothe her, “in being apprenticed, and I have asked these questions only for my own information.What follows has another (and I hope more disinterested) purpose.In humoring my mistake, Miss Havisham, you punished—practiced on—perhaps you will supply whatever term expresses your intention, without offence—your self-seeking relations?”"
"“我是这个意思。怎么，那是他们自找的！你也一样。我既然是这样的身世，那我为什么要煞费苦心，恳求他们、恳求你不要自讨苦吃呢！陷阱是你们自己设下的。我从来没有设过陷阱。”","“I did.Why, they would have it so!So would you.What has been my history, that I should be at the pains of entreating either them, or you, not to have it so!You made your own snares.I never made them.”"
"等她再次平静下来——因为她说这话时，怒气又突然一股脑地冒上来了——我才接着说下去。","Waiting until she was quiet again—for this, too, flashed out of her in a wild and sudden way—I went on."
"“郝维仙小姐，我一到伦敦，就住进了您一个亲戚家里，一直和他们住在一起。我知道他们和我都有同样的错觉。有句话我得跟您说，不管您听不听得进去，也不管您相不相信，如果我不说，那我就太虚伪太卑鄙了。我想说的是，马修·鄱凯特和他儿子赫伯特都是慷慨、正直、坦率的人，做不出图谋不轨的事情。如果您认为他们不是这样的人，您就深深地误会他们了。”","“I have been thrown among one family of your relations, Miss Havisham, and have been constantly among them since I went to London.I know them to have been as honestly under my delusion as I myself.And I should be false and base if I did not tell you, whether it is acceptable to you or no, and whether you are inclined to give credence to it or no, that you deeply wrong both Mr. Matthew Pocket and his son Herbert, if you suppose them to be otherwise than generous, upright, open, and incapable of anything designing or mean.”"
"“他们是你的朋友。”郝维仙小姐说。","“They are your friends,” said Miss Havisham."
"“他们以为是我取代了他们的位置，但还是和我做了朋友。”我说，“而萨拉·鄱凯特、乔治亚娜小姐、卡米拉夫人，我想他们不能算是我的朋友。”","“They made themselves my friends,” said I, “when they supposed me to have superseded them; and when Sarah Pocket, Miss Georgiana, and Mistress Camilla, were not my friends, I think.”"
"我很高兴地看到，我把他们和其他人一对比，使她对他们产生了好感。她目光犀利地看了我一会儿，然后温和地对我说：","This contrasting of them with the rest seemed, I was glad to see, to do them good with her.She looked at me keenly for a little while, and then said quietly:"
"“你想为他们提什么要求呢？”","“What do you want for them?”"
"“只有一点，”我说，“我希望您不要把他们和其他人视为同类。也许他们有同样的血统，但是您要相信我，他们有不一样的品性。”","“Only,” said I, “that you would not confound them with the others.They may be of the same blood, but, believe me, they are not of the same nature.”"
"郝维仙小姐仍旧目光犀利地看着我，又问了一遍：","Still looking at me keenly, Miss Havisham repeated:"
"“你想为他们提什么要求？”","“What do you want for them?”"
"“您看，我不是会耍滑头的人。”我这样回答她，意识到自己的脸有些红了，“即使我想瞒着您，但我瞒不住，我的确是有个要求。郝维仙小姐，如果您能拿出一笔钱，帮我的朋友赫伯特创立基业，但这事一定得瞒着他悄悄地办，我就告诉您我打算怎么做。”","“I am not so cunning, you see,” I said, in answer, conscious that I reddened a little, “as that I could hide from you, even if I desired, that I do want something.Miss Havisham, if you would spare the money to do my friend Herbert a lasting service in life, but which from the nature of the case must be done without his knowledge, I could show you how.”"
"“为什么一定要瞒着他悄悄地办？”她问，双手扶稳拐杖，似乎这样可以更加留神地看着我。","“Why must it be done without his knowledge?” she asked, settling her hands upon her stick, that she might regard me the more attentively."
"“因为，”我说，“我两年前就开始着手办这件事了，我瞒着他，不希望让他知道。为什么我不能把这件事继续做下去，我不能说。这件事和另一个人的秘密有关，但和我的秘密无关。”","“Because,” said I, “I began the service myself, more than two years ago, without his knowledge, and I don’t want to be betrayed.Why I fail in my ability to finish it, I cannot explain.It is a part of the secret which is another person’s and not mine.”"
"她慢慢把视线从我身上移开，转而投向了火炉。起初屋里一片安静，蜡烛渐渐地越烧越短，她就这样看着火炉，似乎过了很久的时间，几块烧得通红的炭火塌了下去，惊动了她，她又一次望了望我——一开始目光空洞洞的——后来，注意力慢慢集中起来了。与此同时，埃斯特拉只顾着忙她的编织。郝维仙小姐把注意力集中到我身上后，她又开口了，好像我们的对话没有中断过一样：","She gradually withdrew her eyes from me, and turned them on the fire.After watching it for what appeared in the silence and by the light of the slowly wasting candles to be a long time, she was roused by the collapse of some of the red coals, and looked towards me again—at first, vacantly—then, with a gradually concentrating attention.All this time, Estella knitted on.When Miss Havisham had fixed her attention on me, she said, speaking as if there had been no lapse in our dialogue:"
"“还有呢？”","“What else?”"
"“埃斯特拉，”我转向了她，努力控制我颤抖的嗓音，“你知道我爱你。你知道我一直以来都深深地爱着你。”","“Estella,” said I, turning to her now, and trying to command my trembling voice, “you know I love you.You know that I have loved you long and dearly.”"
"她听了我这话，抬起头看了看我的脸，没有停下手里的活，只是不动声色地看着我。我看见郝维仙小姐的目光从我身上移到了她身上，又从她身上移到了我身上。","She raised her eyes to my face, on being thus addressed, and her fingers plied their work, and she looked at me with an unmoved countenance.I saw that Miss Havisham glanced from me to her, and from her to me."
"“要不是我这么长时间里一直犯了个错误的话，这话我早就应该跟你说了。这个错误让我误以为郝维仙小姐把我们配成一对了。我以为你是身不由己，可以这么说吧，所以我才忍住没有说。可我现在必须说出来。”","“I should have said this sooner, but for my long mistake.It induced me to hope that Miss Havisham meant us for one another.While I thought you could not help yourself, as it were, I refrained from saying it.But I must say it now.”"
"埃斯特拉依旧不动声色，手里的活依旧没有停下来，只是摇了摇头。","Preserving her unmoved countenance, and with her fingers still going, Estella shook her head."
"“我知道，”我回复她的反应说，“我知道。我不指望有一天能够得到你，埃斯特拉。我不知道我不久后会变成什么样子，会有多穷，也不知道我会在什么地方。但我依然爱你。自从我在这座宅子里第一次看见你，我就爱上了你。”","“I know,” said I, in answer to that action; “I know.I have no hope that I shall ever call you mine, Estella.I am ignorant what may become of me very soon, how poor I may be, or where I may go.Still, I love you.I have loved you ever since I first saw you in this house.”"
"她丝毫不动声色地看着我，手里的活也丝毫没有停下来，她又一次摇了摇头。","Looking at me perfectly unmoved and with her fingers busy, she shook her head again."
"“郝维仙小姐如果早就考虑过她的所作所为将造成的严重后果，却还玩弄一个穷孩子脆弱的感情，这么多年来一直用一个空洞的希望和无望的追求折磨我，那她就太残忍了、残忍至极。但我想她没有考虑过后果。我想她因为自己忍受着煎熬，所以忘了我的煎熬，埃斯特拉。”","“It would have been cruel in Miss Havisham, horribly cruel, to practice on the susceptibility of a poor boy, and to torture me through all these years with a vain hope and an idle pursuit, if she had reflected on the gravity of what she did.But I think she did not.I think that in the endurance of her own trial, she forgot mine, Estella.”"
"我看见郝维仙小姐一只手捂在胸前，一直捂住不放，坐在那里一会儿看看埃斯特拉，一会儿看看我。","I saw Miss Havisham put her hand to her heart and hold it there, as she sat looking by turns at Estella and at me."
"“看来，”埃斯特拉十分平静地说，“有一些情感，或者说幻想——我不知道该叫它们什么才好——是我不能理解的。你说你爱我，我从字面上理解你的意思，但仅此而已。你的话没有到我心里去，没有触动我的心弦。你说的话我一点也不在乎。这个我早就试着警告过你，不是吗？”","“It seems,” said Estella, very calmly, “that there are sentiments, fancies—I don’t know how to call them—which I am not able to comprehend.When you say you love me, I know what you mean, as a form of words; but nothing more.You address nothing in my breast, you touch nothing there.I don’t care for what you say at all.I have tried to warn you of this; now, have I not?”"
"我痛苦地回了一声：“是的。”","I said in a miserable manner, “Yes.”"
"“是的。可你听不进我的警告，你以为我只是说说而已，不是当真的。现在，你还认为我只是说说而已吗？”","“Yes.But you would not be warned, for you thought I did not mean it.Now, did you not think so?”"
"“我以为你不是当真的，也希望你不是当真的。你是这么年轻、这么没有人生经验、这么漂亮，埃斯特拉！这当然不会是出于你的本性。”","“I thought and hoped you could not mean it.You, so young, untried, and beautiful, Estella!Surely it is not in Nature.”"
"“这是出于我的本性，”她反驳我说。然后她加重了语气，又说道，“这出于我内在的本性。我说这么多，已经是把你和其他所有人都区别对待了。我已经仁至义尽了。”","“It is in my nature,” she returned.And then she added, with a stress upon the words, “It is in the nature formed within me.I make a great difference between you and all other people when I say so much.I can do no more.”"
"“本特利·德鲁莫尔到镇上来了，他是来追求你的，是不是？”我问。","“Is it not true,” said I, “that Bentley Drummle is in town here, and pursuing you?”"
"“一点没错。”她提到他时，用的是十分轻蔑而冷淡的语气。","“It is quite true,” she replied, referring to him with the indifference of utter contempt."
"“你今天要助长他的兴头，和他出去骑马，和他一起吃饭，是不是？”","“That you encourage him, and ride out with him, and that he dines with you this very day?”"
"我竟然连这也知道，她显得有些惊讶，但她的回答还是：“一点没错。”","She seemed a little surprised that I should know it, but again replied, “Quite true.”"
"“你不会爱他的，埃斯特拉！”","“You cannot love him, Estella!”"
"她第一次停下了手里的活，非常气愤地反驳我：“我是怎么跟你说的？不管我怎么说，你还是一心以为，我说话不是当真的？”","Her fingers stopped for the first time, as she retorted rather angrily, “What have I told you?Do you still think, in spite of it, that I do not mean what I say?”"
"“你不会嫁给他吧，埃斯特拉？”","“You would never marry him, Estella?”"
"她看了郝维仙小姐一眼，没有停下手里的活计，想了一会儿。然后她说：“我还是跟你说实话吧。我要嫁给他了。”","She looked towards Miss Havisham, and considered for a moment with her work in her hands.Then she said, “Why not tell you the truth?I am going to be married to him.”"
"我低下头，双手捂着脸，但还是控制住了自己，想想我听了她这些话，承受了多大的痛苦，我的控制力比料想的要好。当我再一次抬起头，只见郝维仙小姐的脸上露出了苍白的神色，我当时虽然情绪激动、悲痛不已，但她这副神色还是让我吃了一惊。","I dropped my face into my hands, but was able to control myself better than I could have expected, considering what agony it gave me to hear her say those words.When I raised my face again, there was such a ghastly look upon Miss Havisham’s, that it impressed me, even in my passionate hurry and grief."
"“埃斯特拉，最最亲爱的埃斯特拉，不要让郝维仙小姐把你引上这条绝路。把我永远丢到一边——你已经这么做了，我很清楚——可是你要嫁一个比德鲁莫尔更值得嫁的人。郝维仙小姐把你许配给他，对许许多多比他好得多的、爱慕你的人，还有极少数真正爱你的人来说，这都是最大的侮辱和伤害。在那些极少数的人里面，也许有一个人，他像我一样，爱你爱得那么深，虽然没有我爱你爱得那么久。选择他吧，为你自己着想，这也会让我好受些。”","“Estella, dearest dearest Estella, do not let Miss Havisham lead you into this fatal step.Put me aside for ever—you have done so, I well know—but bestow yourself on some worthier person than Drummle.Miss Havisham gives you to him, as the greatest slight and injury that could be done to the many far better men who admire you, and to the few who truly love you.Among those few, there may be one who loves you even as dearly, though he has not loved you as long, as I.Take him, and I can bear it better, for your sake!”"
"我的真心诚意让她很是惊讶，看来，如果她明白我的心思，她会对我表示同情的。","My earnestness awoke a wonder in her that seemed as if it would have been touched with compassion, if she could have rendered me at all intelligible to her own mind."
"她用温和的语调又说了一遍：“我要嫁给他了。婚事正在筹备当中，我马上就要出嫁了。你何必冤枉我的养母呢？这是我自己的行为。”","“I am going,” she said again, in a gentler voice, “to be married to him.The preparations for my marriage are making, and I shall be married soon.Why do you injuriously introduce the name of my mother by adoption?It is my own act.”"
"“你自己的行为，埃斯特拉，让自己委身于一个禽兽？”","“Your own act, Estella, to fling yourself away upon a brute?”"
"“那我应该委身于谁呢？”她笑着反驳我，“难道我该委身于一个很快就心猿意马，把我抛弃的人（如果真的有这样的人）？好了！事情已成定局。我会过得很好，我丈夫也会过得很好。至于你说郝维仙小姐把我引上绝路，她倒是希望我等一等，不必急着结婚，可我厌倦了现在的生活，这样的生活对我来说一点乐趣也没有，我非常想改变现在的生活。不必多说了。我们永远理解不了对方。”","“On whom should I fling myself away?” she retorted, with a smile.“Should I fling myself away upon the man who would the soonest feel (if people do feel such things) that I took nothing to him?There!It is done.I shall do well enough, and so will my husband.As to leading me into what you call this fatal step, Miss Havisham would have had me wait, and not marry yet; but I am tired of the life I have led, which has very few charms for me, and I am willing enough to change it.Say no more.We shall never understand each other.”"
"“这样一个卑鄙的禽兽，这样一个愚蠢的畜生！”我绝望地喊道。","“Such a mean brute, such a stupid brute!” I urged in despair."
"“别担心，我不会是他的幸福的。”埃斯特拉说，“我也不会让他幸福的。好了！和我握个手。我们就此告别吧，你这个爱幻想的孩子——应该算大人了吧？”","“Don’t be afraid of my being a blessing to him,” said Estella; “I shall not be that.Come!Here is my hand.Do we part on this, you visionary boy—or man?”"
"“唉，埃斯特拉！”我再也控制不住了，苦涩的眼泪簌簌地流到她的手上，说，“即使我还在英国，还能跻身绅士的行列，可我怎么能眼巴巴地看你成了德鲁莫尔的妻子呀？”","“O Estella!” I answered, as my bitter tears fell fast on her hand, do what I would to restrain them; “even if I remained in England and could hold my head up with the rest, how could I see you Drummle’s wife?”"
"“胡说，”她反驳我，“胡说。你很快就会忘得一干二净的。”","“Nonsense,” she returned, “nonsense.This will pass in no time.”"
"“永远不会，埃斯特拉！”","“Never, Estella!”"
"“你不出一星期就会把我撇到脑后的。”","“You will get me out of your thoughts in a week.”"
"“撇到脑后！你是我生命的一部分，是我自身的一部分。我这个鲁莽而普通的小男孩第一次到这里来，可怜的心就被你伤了。从此以后，我读的每一本书，字里行间都是你。我看到的每一个景色，里面都有你——河流、帆船、沼泽地、云朵、日光、黑夜、微风、树林、海洋、街道，到处都有你的身影。我脑子里只要一浮想联翩，你就是我每一个美好幻想的化身。你的存在，你对我的影响，比伦敦城里最坚固的石头建筑还要真实，你的手可以把这些石头移走，但却不能把你对我的影响移走，它们无处不在，它们将影响我一辈子。埃斯特拉，哪怕到了我生命的最后一刻，你也仍然是我生命的一部分，我身上就算有一点优点，其中的一部分也是你，我身上的缺点也有你的份，这个你无法逃避。不过，我们这一次分离，我以后只会记得你的好，我会永远只记得你的好，你一定是给我的好比给我的伤害多得多，要不然我现在不会这么痛苦。愿上帝保佑你，上帝原谅你！”","“Out of my thoughts!You are part of my existence, part of myself.You have been in every line I have ever read, since I first came here, the rough common boy whose poor heart you wounded even then.You have been in every prospect I have ever seen since—on the river, on the sails of the ships, on the marshes, in the clouds, in the light, in the darkness, in the wind, in the woods, in the sea, in the streets.You have been the embodiment of every graceful fancy that my mind has ever become acquainted with.The stones of which the strongest London buildings are made, are not more real, or more impossible to be displaced by your hands, than your presence and influence have been to me, there and everywhere, and will be.Estella, to the last hour of my life, you cannot choose but remain part of my character, part of the little good in me, part of the evil.But, in this separation I associate you only with the good, and I will faithfully hold you to that always, for you must have done me far more good than harm, let me feel now what sharp distress I may.O God bless you, God forgive you!”"
"我不知道当时怎么会因为悲伤至极，说出这样颠三倒四的话来。我这一番狂热的话从心里涌出，就好像鲜血从身体里面的伤口一下子喷涌而出。我把她的手放到唇边，迟迟不肯放下，最后还是离开了她。但从那以后，我记得——不久以后我的理由更加充分了——埃斯特拉只是疑惑而惊讶地看着我，而那幽灵般的郝维仙小姐，一只手还捂着胸口，好像整个人化为了一个鬼影，充满同情和悔恨地盯着我。","In what ecstasy of unhappiness I got these broken words out of myself, I don’t know.The rhapsody welled up within me, like blood from an inward wound, and gushed out.I held her hand to my lips some lingering moments, and so I left her.But ever afterwards, I remembered—and soon afterwards with stronger reason—that while Estella looked at me merely with incredulous wonder, the spectral figure of Miss Havisham, her hand still covering her heart, seemed all resolved into a ghastly stare of pity and remorse."
"一切都结束了，一切都结束了！所有的一切都结束了，都没有了，我从大门里走出来的时候，天色好像比我进去的时候更阴沉了。我穿过几条小巷，走了几条旁路，然后一路往伦敦走去。因为这时我神志已经清醒过来了，我想了想，我不能回饭店看德鲁莫尔那副嘴脸，也无法忍受坐在公共马车里跟人答话，除了把自己弄个精疲力尽，我想不出其他更好的办法来了。","All done, all gone!So much was done and gone, that when I went out at the gate, the light of the day seemed of a darker color than when I went in.For a while, I hid myself among some lanes and by-paths, and then struck off to walk all the way to London.For, I had by that time come to myself so far, as to consider that I could not go back to the inn and see Drummle there; that I could not bear to sit upon the coach and be spoken to; that I could do nothing half so good for myself as tire myself out."
"走过伦敦桥，已经过了午夜时分。当时米德尔塞克斯沿岸有一些错综复杂的狭窄街道通往西面，我去坦普尔最近的路就是沿河而行，穿过怀特弗莱尔斯路。赫伯特预计我明天才能回来，但我有钥匙，如果赫伯特已经睡了，我可以自己上床去睡而不惊动他。","It was past midnight when I crossed London Bridge.Pursuing the narrow intricacies of the streets which at that time tended westward near the Middlesex shore of the river, my readiest access to the Temple was close by the river-side, through Whitefriars.I was not expected till to-morrow, but I had my keys, and, if Herbert were gone to bed, could get to bed myself without disturbing him."
"由于我平时绝少在坦普尔关门后走怀特弗莱尔斯路这头的门，而且我一身污泥，疲惫不堪，所以守夜人仔仔细细打量了我一番，才把门开了个缝让我进去，对此我并不介意。怕他想不起来，我干脆告诉了他我的名字。","As it seldom happened that I came in at that Whitefriars gate after the Temple was closed, and as I was very muddy and weary, I did not take it ill that the night-porter examined me with much attention as he held the gate a little way open for me to pass in.To help his memory I mentioned my name."
"“我不是很确定，先生，但我估计是您。这里有您的一封信，先生。送信人说，请您就在我的灯笼下打开看。”","“I was not quite sure, sir, but I thought so.Here’s a note, sir.The messenger that brought it, said would you be so good as read it by my lantern?”"
"这个要求让我很吃惊，我接过信。收信人写的是菲利普·皮普先生，姓名上面写着几个字：“请当场拆看。”我拆开信，守夜人举起灯笼，我一看,发现信中是温米克的字迹。","Much surprised by the request, I took the note.It was directed to Philip Pip, Esquire, and on the top of the superscription were the words, “PLEASE READ THIS, HERE.”I opened it, the watchman holding up his light, and read inside, in Wemmick’s writing:"
"第四十五章","Chapter 45"
"我一读完这封警告信，就扭头从坦普尔大门走了出来，选了一条最佳路线往弗利特街走去，在那里坐上了一辆夜间出租马车，马车一路往科芬园的汉姆斯旅馆驶去。在那个年头，晚上不管多晚都能在那间旅馆里找到床铺。掌柜的带我从小门进去，点亮了架子上最靠近手边的一只蜡烛，领着我进了牌子上标着的第一间空房。这是一间位于底层的后房，有点像地窖，一张床像是一个专制的魔王，四根床柱像四条腿横跨整个房间，一条腿恣意伸进壁炉里，另一条伸到了门口，摆出一副神圣不可侵犯的样子，把可怜的小脸盆架挤得动弹不得。","Turning from the Temple gate as soon as I had read the warning, I made the best of my way to Fleet-street, and there got a late hackney chariot and drove to the Hummums in Covent Garden.In those times a bed was always to be got there at any hour of the night, and the chamberlain, letting me in at his ready wicket, lighted the candle next in order on his shelf, and showed me straight into the bedroom next in order on his list.It was a sort of vault on the ground floor at the back, with a despotic monster of a four-post bedstead in it, straddling over the whole place, putting one of his arbitrary legs into the fire-place and another into the doorway, and squeezing the wretched little washing-stand in quite a Divinely Righteous manner."
"我向掌柜的要了一根夜间照明的蜡烛，掌柜的拿了一根民风淳朴的年代用的那种蜡烛，然后走开了——这玩意就像手杖变成的精灵，只要碰一下，后背立刻就断了，哪里能用来照明。一根孤零零的蜡烛插在中间底座上，好像被囚禁了一般，蜡烛外面围了个打满了孔的铁罩，烛光透过小圆孔射到墙上，点点亮斑很是吓人。我上了床，躺在那里，两只脚又酸又痛，疲惫不堪、悲惨不已，只要这个傻瓜似的百眼巨人不闭上眼睛，我也没法阖眼。于是，在这个沉闷的深夜里，我和这个百眼巨人就这样你看着我，我看着你。","As I had asked for a night-light, the chamberlain had brought me in, before he left me, the good old constitutional rush-light of those virtuous days—an object like the ghost of a walking-cane, which instantly broke its back if it were touched, which nothing could ever be lighted at, and which was placed in solitary confinement at the bottom of a high tin tower, perforated with round holes that made a staringly wide-awake pattern on the walls.When I had got into bed, and lay there footsore, weary, and wretched, I found that I could no more close my own eyes than I could close the eyes of this foolish Argus.And thus, in the gloom and death of the night, we stared at one another."
"多么悲凉的夜晚啊！多么心烦、多么惨淡、多么漫长！屋里弥漫着一股冷煤烟和热炉灰的气味，让人很是不快。我往上看着头顶上方屋顶的四个角落，想像有不计其数的肉店里的绿头苍蝇、市场上的钻耳虫、乡下的蛆，一定都守在那里，只等夏天一到就出来活动。我不禁担心起来，万一哪个家伙不小心掉下来了呢，立刻就觉得好像有东西轻轻掉到脸上了——这个念头真让人不快，接着又觉得有更多讨厌的家伙在我背上爬。我醒着躺了一会儿，在一片寂静中，只听见那些稀奇古怪的声音开始作响。壁橱在窃窃私语，壁炉在叹气，小脸盆架滴答作响，抽屉里的吉他琴弦时不时发出声响。与此同时，百眼巨人在墙上的投影换了种表情，我看见每一个瞪着的圆眼里都写着：“切勿回家”。","What a doleful night!How anxious, how dismal, how long!There was an inhospitable smell in the room, of cold soot and hot dust; and, as I looked up into the corners of the tester over my head, I thought what a number of blue-bottle flies from the butchers’, and earwigs from the market, and grubs from the country, must be holding on up there, lying by for next summer.This led me to speculate whether any of them ever tumbled down, and then I fancied that I felt light falls on my face—a disagreeable turn of thought, suggesting other and more objectionable approaches up my back.When I had lain awake a little while, those extraordinary voices with which silence teems, began to make themselves audible.The closet whispered, the fireplace sighed, the little washing-stand ticked, and one guitar-string played occasionally in the chest of drawers.At about the same time, the eyes on the wall acquired a new expression, and in every one of those staring rounds I saw written, DON’T GO HOME."
"在这样一个夜里，不管是什么念头，也不管是什么喧嚣向我蜂拥而来，都无法把“切勿回家”这四个字从我脑海里驱散。不管我脑子里想什么，它都要搅合进来，好像身上的疼痛一样，无法摆脱。不久前，我从报纸上读到，一天，一位不知名的客人夜里到汉姆斯旅馆投宿，上床以后自杀了，第二天早上有人发现他整个人浸在血泊里。我脑子里闪过一个念头：那人住的一定是我这间房。我爬下床，想要确认一下房间里没有血迹。接着我打开门朝过道望去，远远地看见一盏灯的亮光，心里顿时宽慰了，我知道掌柜的就在亮光附近打盹。而与此同时，我一直在想为什么我不能回家，家里发生了什么事，我什么时候可以回家，普罗维斯在家里是否平安无事，这些问题不停地在我脑子里打转，脑子里已经没有余地去想别的问题了。即使当我想到了埃斯特拉，想到我们当日一见竟是永别，想到我们分别时的种种情形，想到她的种种表情和语气，想到她编织时手指的动作——即使在想到这些的时候，我还处处可见“切勿回家”的警告。最后我身心俱疲，打起盹来，这句话变成了一个巨大而模糊的影子，要我给它做动词变位。变成现在时的祈使句就是：你别回家，别让他回家，我们别回家，你们别回家，别让他们回家。然后又变成了委婉语气：我不太可能回家，我不能回家，我不可能回家，我不应该回家。直到最后我觉得自己要发疯了，头枕着枕头翻来覆去睡不着，又一次看着墙上瞪着的圆眼。","Whatever night-fancies and night-noises crowded on me, they never warded off this DON’T GO HOME.It plaited itself into whatever I thought of, as a bodily pain would have done.Not long before, I had read in the newspapers, how a gentleman unknown had come to the Hummums in the night, and had gone to bed, and had destroyed himself, and had been found in the morning weltering in blood.It came into my head that he must have occupied this very vault of mine, and I got out of bed to assure myself that there were no red marks about; then opened the door to look out into the passages, and cheer myself with the companionship of a distant light, near which I knew the chamberlain to be dozing.But all this time, why I was not to go home, and what had happened at home, and when I should go home, and whether Provis was safe at home, were questions occupying my mind so busily, that one might have supposed there could be no more room in it for any other theme.Even when I thought of Estella, and how we had parted that day for ever, and when I recalled all the circumstances of our parting, and all her looks and tones, and the action of her fingers while she knitted—even then I was pursuing, here and there and everywhere, the caution Don’t go home.When at last I dozed, in sheer exhaustion of mind and body, it became a vast shadowy verb which I had to conjugate.Imperative mood, present tense: Do not thou go home, let him not go home, let us not go home, do not ye or you go home, let not them go home.Then, potentially: I may not and I cannot go home; and I might not, could not, would not, and should not go home; until I felt that I was going distracted, and rolled over on the pillow, and looked at the staring rounds upon the wall again."
"我吩咐过掌柜的明早七点叫我，因为很显然，我明天第一个要见的人就是温米克，同样显而易见的是，关于这事要听他的见解，只能去沃尔沃斯。度过了这样一个难熬的夜晚，走出这间房子让我心情放松不少，没等掌柜第二次敲门，我就从这张辗转反侧了一晚的床上一跃而起了。","I had left directions that I was to be called at seven; for it was plain that I must see Wemmick before seeing any one else, and equally plain that this was a case in which his Walworth sentiments, only, could be taken.It was a relief to get out of the room where the night had been so miserable, and I needed no second knocking at the door to startle me from my uneasy bed."
"到八点钟时，城垛已经出现在我眼前了。正巧这时小女仆拿着两个热面包圈走进堡垒，我跟着她从后门进去，通过了吊桥，没有通报一声就来到了温米克面前，他正在给自己和老人家沏茶。从一扇开着的门里，我看到老人家还躺在床上。","The Castle battlements arose upon my view at eight o’clock.The little servant happening to be entering the fortress with two hot rolls, I passed through the postern and crossed the drawbridge, in her company, and so came without announcement into the presence of Wemmick as he was making tea for himself and the Aged.An open door afforded a perspective view of the Aged in bed."
"“啊呀，皮普先生，你来了！”温米克说，“那么，你还是回家了？”","“Halloa, Mr. Pip!” said Wemmick.“You did come home, then?”"
"“是的，”我说，“但我没进去。”","“Yes,” I returned; “but I didn’t go home.”"
"“很好，”他搓了搓手，说，“我在坦普尔的每个大门口都给你留了信，以防万一。你去的是哪个门？”","“That’s all right,” said he, rubbing his hands.“I left a note for you at each of the Temple gates, on the chance.Which gate did you come to?”"
"我告诉了他。","I told him."
"“我今天要去其他大门口把信销毁。”温米克说，“能够不落证据到别人手里就尽量不落，这是一条原则。因为你不知道什么时候可能会被人抓住把柄。我想请你做一件事。——你介不介意帮老人家烤这根香肠？”","“I’ll go round to the others in the course of the day and destroy the notes,” said Wemmick; “it’s a good rule never to leave documentary evidence if you can help it, because you don’t know when it may be put in.I’m going to take a liberty with you.—Would you mind toasting this sausage for the Aged P.?”"
"我回答说我很乐意帮忙。","I said I should be delighted to do it."
"“你可以去做你的事了，玛丽·安妮。”温米克对小女仆说。她走后，他对我使了个眼色，说道：“你看，现在就剩下我们两个了，皮普先生。”","“Then you can go about your work, Mary Anne,” said Wemmick to the little servant; “which leaves us to ourselves, don’t you see, Mr. Pip?” he added, winking, as she disappeared."
"我谢过他的友谊和谨慎后，我们一边小声地交谈，我一边为老人家烤香肠，他一边给老人家的面包片涂黄油。","I thanked him for his friendship and caution, and our discourse proceeded in a low tone, while I toasted the Aged’s sausage and he buttered the crumb of the Aged’s roll."
"“皮普先生，你知道，”温米克说，“我们都是了解对方的。我们现在是以私人和个人的身份谈话的，我们为了一件机密的事情打交道，今天已经不是第一次了。事务所里的看法是一回事。不过，现在我们是在事务所之外。”","“Now, Mr. Pip, you know,” said Wemmick, “you and I understand one another.We are in our private and personal capacities, and we have been engaged in a confidential transaction before today.Official sentiments are one thing.We are extra official.”"
"我诚恳地表示同意。我因为过于紧张，把老人家的香肠烤着了，烤的像根火炬，只得赶紧把它吹灭。","I cordially assented.I was so very nervous, that I had already lighted the Aged’s sausage like a torch, and been obliged to blow it out."
"“我昨天早上偶然听到，”温米克说，“我曾经带你去过的一个地方——即使在你我之间，最好也还是不要提是哪个地方——”","“I accidentally heard, yesterday morning,” said Wemmick, “being in a certain place where I once took you—even between you and me, it’s as well not to mention names when avoidable—”"
"“最好不要，”我说，“我懂你的意思。”","“Much better not,” said I.“I understand you.”"
"“我昨天早上在那里偶然听到，”温米克说，“有这么一个人，不是没有做过和殖民地有关的生意，身上也不是没有带一些财产——我不知道这个人可能是谁——这个人的名字我们就不提了——”","“I heard there by chance, yesterday morning,” said Wemmick, “that a certain person not altogether of uncolonial pursuits, and not unpossessed of portable property—I don’t know who it may really be—we won’t name this person—”"
"“没必要提。”我说。","“Not necessary,” said I."
"“——这个人在世界的某个地方引起了小小的风波，那个地方很多人去，人们去那里并不总是自愿的，政府也不是不要拨钱的——”","“—had made some little stir in a certain part of the world where a good many people go, not always in gratification of their own inclinations, and not quite irrespective of the government expense—”"
"我只顾着看他的脸，一个不注意，把老人家的香肠烤得噼啪作响。结果我没法听下去，他也没法讲下去了，我连忙道歉。","In watching his face, I made quite a firework of the Aged’s sausage, and greatly discomposed both my own attention and Wemmick’s; for which I apologized."
"“——那个人从那个地方失踪了，从此下落不明。关于这件事，”温米克说，“有好多种猜测，也有好多种说法。我还听说，你在坦普尔花园坊的房子已经被人监视了，可能还会再次被监视。”","“—by disappearing from such place, and being no more heard of thereabouts.From which,” said Wemmick, “conjectures had been raised and theories formed.I also heard that you at your chambers in Garden Court, Temple, had been watched, and might be watched again.”"
"“被谁监视？”我问。","“By whom?” said I."
"“这个我就不便透露了，”温米克遮遮掩掩地说，“这可能会和我的职业责任相冲突。我只是听说而已，在那个地方我经常听到奇奇怪怪的事情。我告诉你的并不是确切的消息。我只是听说的。”","“I wouldn’t go into that,” said Wemmick, evasively, “it might clash with official responsibilities.I heard it, as I have in my time heard other curious things in the same place.I don’t tell it you on information received.I heard it.”"
"他一边说，一边从我手里拿过烤叉和香肠，把老人家的早餐整整齐齐地放在一个小托盘里。在把早餐端给老人家之前，他先带了一块干净的白布到老人家房间，把白布系在老人家的下巴上，扶他坐了起来，把他的睡帽推到一旁，老人家这样子看起来还挺时髦的。然后，他小心翼翼地把早餐端到他面前，问了句：“你好吗，老父亲？”老人家神采奕奕地答道：“很好，约翰，我的孩子，很好！”老人家和我似乎都不言自明，他现在不方便见客，所以我就当没看见他，我假装完全不知道房间里发生的事。","He took the toasting-fork and sausage from me as he spoke, and set forth the Aged’s breakfast neatly on a little tray.Previous to placing it before him, he went into the Aged’s room with a clean white cloth, and tied the same under the old gentleman’s chin, and propped him up, and put his nightcap on one side, and gave him quite a rakish air.Then, he placed his breakfast before him with great care, and said, “All right, ain’t you, Aged P.?”To which the cheerful Aged replied,“All right, John, my boy, all right!”As there seemed to be a tacit understanding that the Aged was not in a presentable state, and was therefore to be considered invisible, I made a pretence of being in complete ignorance of these proceedings."
"“你说有人监视我的房子（我曾经有一次怀疑过这件事），”温米克一回来，我就问他，“跟你刚才提到的那个人有关，是不是？”","“This watching of me at my chambers (which I have once had reason to suspect),” I said to Wemmick when he came back, “is inseparable from the person to whom you have adverted; is it?”"
"温米克表情很严肃：“这个我说不上来，我知道的就这么多。我的意思是，我不能说一开始就是这样。但也许是这样，或者将要这样，或者大有这样的危险。”","Wemmick looked very serious.“I couldn’t undertake to say that, of my own knowledge.I mean, I couldn’t undertake to say it was at first.But it either is, or it will be, or it’s in great danger of being.”"
"我看得出来，他之所以不能想说什么就说什么，是因为他要对小不列颠街忠诚。他向我透露了这么多，已经远远超过他所能透露的了，我感激他还来不及，怎么能强迫他呢。我在炉火前沉思了一会儿，对他说，我想问他一个问题，他认为能回答就回答，不能回答就不回答，他觉得怎么好就怎样办。他放下了早餐，胳膊交叉抱在一起，拧了拧衬衫袖子（他认为在室内的一大好处就是不用穿外套），对我点了一下头，示意我提问。","As I saw that he was restrained by fealty to Little Britain from saying as much as he could, and as I knew with thankfulness to him how far out of his way he went to say what he did, I could not press him.But I told him, after a little meditation over the fire, that I would like to ask him a question, subject to his answering or not answering, as he deemed right, and sure that his course would be right.He paused in his breakfast, and crossing his arms, and pinching his shirt-sleeves (his notion of indoor comfort was to sit without any coat), he nodded to me once, to put my question."
"“你听说过一个叫康培生的坏蛋吗？”","“You have heard of a man of bad character, whose true name is Compeyson?”"
"他又点了点头，表示回答。","He answered with one other nod."
"“他还活着吗？”","“Is he living?”"
"他又点了点头。","One other nod."
"“他在伦敦吗？”","“Is he in London?”"
"他再次点了点头，那张邮筒般的嘴抿得紧紧的，向我最后点了点头，然后继续吃他的早餐。","He gave me one other nod, compressed the post-office exceedingly, gave me one last nod, and went on with his breakfast."
"“好了，”温米克说，“提问时间结束。”说这话时他加重了语气，而且重复了一遍，接着他说：“我跟你说说我听到那些话以后做了什么吧。我去花园坊找你，没找到，我就去克拉利克公司找赫伯特了。”","“Now,” said Wemmick, “questioning being over;” which he emphasized and repeated for my guidance; “I come to what I did, after hearing what I heard.I went to Garden Court to find you; not finding you, I went to Clarriker’s to find Mr. Herbert.”"
"“你找到他了？”我十分焦急地问道。","“And him you found?” said I, with great anxiety."
"“我找到他了。我什么名字也没提，什么细节也没说，只是跟他说，如果他知道某人——不管他叫什么名字——住在这房子附近，或者这街坊附近，那他最好在你回来之前，让这个不管叫什么名字的人搬出去。”","“And him I found.Without mentioning any names or going into any details, I gave him to understand that if he was aware of anybody—Tom, Jack, or Richard—being about the chambers, or about the immediate neighborhood, he had better get Tom, Jack, or Richard, out of the way while you were out of the way.”"
"“他大概疑惑不解、不知所措了吧？”","“He would be greatly puzzled what to do?”"
"“他确实疑惑不解、不知所措，因为我跟他说，目前想把这个不管叫什么名字的人弄到太远的地方也不安全。皮普先生，我跟你说。照目前的形势看，进了大城市，就有大城市的好处，别的地方都比不上。不要太早急着出去。先躲一躲。等形势缓和下来，再试着出去透透风，甚至去嗅嗅外国的空气也可以。”","“He was puzzled what to do; not the less, because I gave him my opinion that it was not safe to try to get Tom, Jack, or Richard, too far out of the way at present.Mr. Pip, I’ll tell you something.Under existing circumstances there is no place like a great city when you are once in it.Don’t break cover too soon.Lie close.Wait till things slacken, before you try the open, even for foreign air.”"
"我谢过他的宝贵建议，问他赫伯特是怎么做的。","I thanked him for his valuable advice, and asked him what Herbert had done?"
"“赫伯特先生，”温米克说，“一开始吓得缩成一团了，过了半个小时，他想出了一个计划。他跟我说了个秘密，他正在追求一位年轻的小姐，这位小姐有个卧床不起的爸爸，这你应该是知道的吧。她爸爸原先是一名轮船事务长，现在他躺着的床就靠在一扇凸肚窗前，从窗口可以看见河上来来往往的船只。你应该认识那位年轻小姐吧？”","“Mr. Herbert,” said Wemmick, “after being all of a heap for half an hour, struck out a plan.He mentioned to me as a secret, that he is courting a young lady who has, as no doubt you are aware, a bedridden Pa.Which Pa, having been in the Purser line of life, lies a-bed in a bow-window where he can see the ships sail up and down the river.You are acquainted with the young lady, most probably?”"
"“我没见过。”我说。","“Not personally,” said I."
"事实是这样的，她认为赫伯特交上我这样一个花钱大手大脚的朋友没什么好处，所以，赫伯特第一次提出要把我介绍给她认识的时候，她对这一提议没有表现出多大的热情，赫伯特觉得有必要把这一情况跟我说明，打算过些时候再介绍我们认识。后来我开始暗中资助赫伯特，帮他建立事业，我对这事也看得开了。对于他和他未婚妻来说，当然不希望很快有第三个人加入到他们的往来当中。所以，虽然我确信自己在克拉拉心目中的地位有所提高，虽然这位年轻小姐和我长期以来一直由赫伯特当中间人互相问候，我却从没见过她。不过，这些细节我没有跟温米克啰嗦。","The truth was, that she had objected to me as an expensive companion who did Herbert no good, and that, when Herbert had first proposed to present me to her, she had received the proposal with such very moderate warmth, that Herbert had felt himself obliged to confide the state of the case to me, with a view to the lapse of a little time before I made her acquaintance.When I had begun to advance Herbert’s prospects by Stealth, I had been able to bear this with cheerful philosophy; he and his affianced, for their part, had naturally not been very anxious to introduce a third person into their interviews; and thus, although I was assured that I had risen in Clara’s esteem, and although the young lady and I had long regularly interchanged messages and remembrances by Herbert, I had never seen her.However, I did not trouble Wemmick with these particulars."
"“那个有凸肚窗的房子，”温米克说，“就在河边，位于莱姆豪斯和格林尼治之间的普尔地区，这房子好像是一位颇有名望的寡妇的家产，她有一间楼上的房间，连家具一起出租，赫伯特先生问我，把那间房子暂时租下来给某人住怎么样。我觉得这个主意非常好，我可以说出三条理由来。你听听我的理由。第一：这根本不是你常去的地方，而且离那些热闹的大街小巷又远。第二：你用不着自己去，可以让赫伯特捎给你某人的消息。第三：过一阵子，等时机成熟了，要是你想偷偷把某人送上哪条外国班轮，他随时都准备好了。”","“The house with the bow-window,” said Wemmick, “being by the river-side, down the Pool there between Limehouse and Greenwich, and being kept, it seems, by a very respectable widow who has a furnished upper floor to let, Mr. Herbert put it to me, what did I think of that as a temporary tenement for Tom, Jack, or Richard?Now, I thought very well of it, for three reasons I’ll give you.That is to say.Firstly.It’s altogether out of all your beats, and is well away from the usual heap of streets great and small.Secondly.Without going near it yourself, you could always hear of the safety of Tom, Jack, or Richard, through Mr. Herbert.Thirdly.After a while and when it might be prudent, if you should want to slip Tom, Jack, or Richard, on board a foreign packet-boat, there he is—ready.”"
"听了温米克的这些想法，我心里宽慰了许多。我再三向他道谢，恳求他接着说下去。","Much comforted by these considerations, I thanked Wemmick again and again, and begged him to proceed."
"“好吧，先生！赫伯特先生热心地把这件事承担起来了，昨晚九点钟，他把某人——不管他叫什么名字——你我都不必知道——安安稳稳地送进新房子里去了。给老房子的房东的说法是，某人应邀要到多佛尔去，事实上他只是经过多佛尔街，拐个弯就离开了。这么做还有一大好处，那就是，你当时不在场。如果有人在监视你的行踪，那他一定知道你当时远在千里之外，在忙别的事情。这样就转移了怀疑的目标，给人造成迷惑。所以我才建议你，即使你昨晚回去了，也别回家。这样就更让人迷惑不解了，越是迷惑不解，对你就越有利。”","“Well, sir!Mr. Herbert threw himself into the business with a will, and by nine o’clock last night he housed Tom, Jack, or Richard—whichever it may be—you and I don’t want to know—quite successfully.At the old lodgings it was understood that he was summoned to Dover, and in fact he was taken down the Dover road and cornered out of it.Now, another great advantage of all this, is, that it was done without you, and when, if any one was concerning himself about your movements, you must be known to be ever so many miles off and quite otherwise engaged.This diverts suspicion and confuses it; and for the same reason I recommended that even if you came back last night, you should not go home.It brings in more confusion, and you want confusion.”"
"温米克这时已经用完了早餐，看了看表，开始穿外套。","Wemmick, having finished his breakfast, here looked at his watch, and began to get his coat on."
"“现在，皮普先生，”他两只手还没从袖子里伸出来，对我说，“凡是我能做的，我应该都做了，但如果还有什么是我能做的——从沃尔沃斯的角度来说，完全从个人和私人的交情出发——我很乐意效劳。这是新房地址。你不妨在今晚回家之前，亲自去看看某人是不是平安无事——这也是为什么让你昨晚别回家的原因之一。不过，你回家以后，就不要再去了。你太客气了，皮普先生。”他的手已经从袖子里伸出来了，我正握着呢。“我最后还有一件重要的事要跟你提一下。”他双手搭在我肩上，郑重其事地低声对我说：“今晚要设法把他的动产弄到手。你说不准他可能发生什么意外。可别让动产出什么意外。”","“And now, Mr. Pip,” said he, with his hands still in the sleeves, “I have probably done the most I can do; but if I can ever do more—from a Walworth point of view, and in a strictly private and personal capacity—I shall be glad to do it.Here’s the address.There can be no harm in your going here tonight and seeing for yourself that all is well with Tom, Jack, or Richard, before you go home—which is another reason for your not going home last night.But after you have gone home, don’t go back here.You are very welcome, I am sure, Mr. Pip;” his hands were now out of his sleeves, and I was shaking them; “and let me finally impress one important point upon you.”He laid his hands upon my shoulders, and added in a solemn whisper: “Avail yourself of this evening to lay hold of his portable property.You don’t know what may happen to him.Don’t let anything happen to the portable property.”"
"关于动产的事，要把我的想法跟温米克解释清楚是很难办到的，我于是忍住没说。","Quite despairing of making my mind clear to Wemmick on this point, I forbore to try."
"“到时间了，”温米克说，“我得走了。如果你没有别的什么更加紧急的事情要办，我建议你留在这里，天黑以后再走。你看起来忧心忡忡的，为什么不跟老人家一起清清静静地好好过一天呢——他马上就起床了——再吃一点——你还记得那头猪吧？”","“Time’s up,” said Wemmick, “and I must be off.If you had nothing more pressing to do than to keep here till dark, that’s what I should advise.You look very much worried, and it would do you good to have a perfectly quiet day with the Aged—he’ll be up presently—and a little bit of—you remember the pig?”"
"“当然。”我说。","“Of course,” said I."
"“好，再吃一点它的肉吧。你刚才烤的那根香肠就是用它的肉做的，无论从哪一方面看，它都是顶呱呱的。尝一尝吧，看在它是你老相识的份上。再见，老父亲！”他兴致昂扬地喊了一声。","“Well; and a little bit of him.That sausage you toasted was his, and he was in all respects a first-rater.Do try him, if it is only for old acquaintance sake.Good-bye, Aged Parent!” in a cheery shout."
"“好的，约翰，好的，我的孩子！”老人家在房间里尖声喊道。","“All right, John; all right, my boy!” piped the old man from within."
"没过多久，我就在温米克的壁炉前睡着了。老人家和我相互做伴，这一整天我们俩几乎都是在壁炉前睡过去的。我们中午吃猪腰肉，还有他们菜园里自己种的蔬菜。我如果不是诚心诚意地跟老人家点了头，那也是在瞌睡中跟他点了头。等到天色完全变黑，我跟老人家告辞，让他自己添煤烤面包。我数了数茶杯的个数，看他时不时瞅瞅墙上的两块小门，我估计司琪芬小姐要来了。","I soon fell asleep before Wemmick’s fire, and the Aged and I enjoyed one another’s society by falling asleep before it more or less all day.We had loin of pork for dinner, and greens grown on the estate, and I nodded at the Aged with a good intention whenever I failed to do it drowsily.When it was quite dark, I left the Aged preparing the fire for toast; and I inferred from the number of teacups, as well as from his glances at the two little doors in the wall, that Miss Skiffins was expected."
"第四十六章","Chapter 46"
"钟刚敲过八点，我就到了一处地方。这里的空气中有一股锯木屑和刨花的气味，倒并不难闻。这气味是从长长的河岸边那些制造船舶、船桅、船桨和滑车的作坊里发出来的。对于伦敦桥东边的普尔地区上下一带的水域，我一点也不熟悉。到了河边，我才发现我要找的地方并不如我想像的那样好找。那地方叫做米尔庞德岸叮当湾，除了老青铜绳索道，我不知道还有什么路通向那里。","Eight o’clock had struck before I got into the air that was scented, not disagreeably, by the chips and shavings of the long-shore boat builders, and mast oar and block makers.All that water-side region of the upper and lower Pool below Bridge, was unknown ground to me, and when I struck down by the river, I found that the spot I wanted was not where I had supposed it to be, and was anything but easy to find.It was called Mill Pond Bank, Chinks’ Basin; and I had no other guide to Chinks’ Basin than the Old Green Copper Rope-Walk."
"不提我在废弃的船坞中那些待修的搁浅船只中迷失了多少回；不提废旧船体被拆卸成了多少块；不提海浪冲来了多少淤泥、粘土和渣滓；不提有多少造新船的船坞和拆废船的船坞；不提那生锈的、一头胡乱插在地上、多少年没有派上用场的铁锚；也不提有多少堆积如山的木桶和木材，有多少以老青铜命名的绳索道。我找了很多次都没找到我的目的地，老是经过它却没留意，最终还是意外地拐了个弯，来到了米尔庞德岸。若是把周围的环境都考虑进去，这算得上一个空气清新的地方，从河面上吹来的风有足够的空间在这里打转。中间还立着两三棵树，一架废弃的风车残骸，还有老青铜绳索道——月光下看起来这条路又长又窄，一路上都是些木头船架，看起来就像是废弃的干草耙，破旧不堪、齿牙落尽。","It matters not what stranded ships repairing in dry docks I lost myself among, what old hulls of ships in course of being knocked to pieces, what ooze and slime and other dregs of tide, what yards of ship-builders and ship-breakers, what rusty anchors blindly biting into the ground though for years off duty, what mountainous country of accumulated casks and timber, how many rope-walks that were not the Old Green Copper.After several times falling short of my destination and as often over-shooting it, I came unexpectedly round a corner, upon Mill Pond Bank.It was a fresh kind of place, all circumstances considered, where the wind from the river had room to turn itself round; and there were two or three trees in it, and there was the stump of a ruined windmill, and there was the Old Green Copper Rope-Walk—whose long and narrow vista I could trace in the moonlight, along a series of wooden frames set in the ground, that looked like superannuated haymaking-rakes which had grown old and lost most of their teeth."
"米尔庞德岸上只有几栋看起来很奇特的房子，我选了一栋有木头大门和凸肚窗（不是八角窗）的三层楼房进去，看了看门牌，上面写着：温博尔夫人。这正是我要找的人，我敲了敲门，一位神态和蔼、精神矍铄的老妇人出来开了门。不过，赫伯特很快就出来了，把她换下去了，赫伯特一声不响地领着我进了客厅，关上了大门。在这个十分陌生的地方，在这间十分陌生的房间里，看见了他这张十分熟悉的脸，这种感觉很奇怪。我时而望望他，时而望望摆满玻璃器皿和瓷器的壁角柜，望望壁炉架上的贝壳，望望墙上的彩雕——一个是库克船长之死，一个是新船下水典礼，还有一个是乔治三世陛下站在温莎宫阳台上，他戴着马车夫戴的那种假发，穿着皮裤和高筒靴。","Selecting from the few queer houses upon Mill Pond Bank, a house with a wooden front and three stories of bow-window (not bay-window, which is another thing), I looked at the plate upon the door, and read there, Mrs. Whimple.That being the name I wanted, I knocked, and an elderly woman of a pleasant and thriving appearance responded.She was immediately deposed, however, by Herbert, who silently led me into the parlor and shut the door.It was an odd sensation to see his very familiar face established quite at home in that very unfamiliar room and region; and I found myself looking at him, much as I looked at the corner-cupboard with the glass and china, the shells upon the chimney-piece, and the colored engravings on the wall, representing the death of Captain Cook, a ship-launch, and his Majesty King George the Third in a state-coachman’s wig, leather-breeches, and top-boots, on the terrace at Windsor."
"“这里一切都好，汉德尔，”赫伯特说，“他很满意，只是急着想见你。我女朋友现在和她父亲在一起，如果你愿意等她下来的话，我会介绍你们认识，然后我们上楼去——那是她父亲。”","“All is well, Handel,” said Herbert, “and he is quite satisfied, though eager to see you.My dear girl is with her father; and if you’ll wait till she comes down, I’ll make you known to her, and then we’ll go up-stairs.—That’s her father.”"
"我已经听到头顶上传来一声吓人的咆哮声了，这从我脸上的表情可以看出来。","I had become aware of an alarming growling overhead, and had probably expressed the fact in my countenance."
"“恐怕他就是个糟糕的老混蛋，”赫伯特笑着说，“不过我从来没见过他。你没有闻到朗姆酒的味道吗？他成天和朗姆酒做伴。”","“I am afraid he is a sad old rascal,” said Herbert, smiling, “but I have never seen him.Don’t you smell rum?He is always at it.”"
"“和朗姆酒做伴？”我问。","“At rum?” said I."
"“是的，”赫伯特说，“你想想，酒怎么能缓解他的痛风呢。他还坚持把吃的喝的都放到楼上他自己的房间里，由他来分配。他把它们放到头顶的架子上，每一样都要称。他的房间肯定像个杂货铺。”","“Yes,” returned Herbert, “and you may suppose how mild it makes his gout.He persists, too, in keeping all the provisions upstairs in his room, and serving them out.He keeps them on shelves over his head, and will weigh them all.His room must be like a chandler’s shop.”"
"他正说着，只听见咆哮声变成了一声拉长了的怒吼，然后逐渐消失了。","While he thus spoke, the growling noise became a prolonged roar, and then died away."
"“他偏要自己切奶酪，”赫伯特解释说，“结果还能怎样？一个右手痛风的人——全身其他地方也痛风——偏要切双层格洛斯特奶酪，怎么可能不痛呢。”","“What else can be the consequence,” said Herbert, in explanation, “if he will cut the cheese?A man with the gout in his right hand—and everywhere else—can’t expect to get through a Double Gloucester without hurting himself.”"
"他好像痛得很厉害，因为他又发出了一声狂怒的吼叫。","He seemed to have hurt himself very much, for he gave another furious roar."
"“有普罗维斯这样的房客住在楼上，真是温博尔夫人的福气。”赫伯特说，“一般人哪里受得了他那种噪音啊。这是个奇怪的地方，汉德尔，不是吗？”","“To have Provis for an upper lodger is quite a godsend to Mrs. Whimple,” said Herbert, “for of course people in general won’t stand that noise.A curious place, Handel; isn’t it?”"
"这的确是个奇怪的地方，但十分整洁、干净。","It was a curious place, indeed; but remarkably well kept and clean."
"我把这一看法告诉了赫伯特，他说：“没有比温博尔夫人更好的家庭主妇了。我真想象不出，要是没有她母亲般的关照，我的克拉拉该怎么办。克拉拉没有妈妈，汉德尔，这世上除了凶老头子，她没有别的亲人了。”","“Mrs. Whimple,” said Herbert, when I told him so, “is the best of housewives, and I really do not know what my Clara would do without her motherly help.For, Clara has no mother of her own, Handel, and no relation in the world but old Gruffandgrim.”"
"“凶老头子应该不是他的名字吧，赫伯特？”","“Surely that’s not his name, Herbert?”"
"“不是，不是，”赫伯特说，“那是我给他取的名字。他叫巴利先生。我父母有我这样一个儿子，爱上了这样一个无亲无故的女孩，不用操心她自己的家庭，也不用别人来操心，这是多大的福气呀！”","“No, no,” said Herbert, “that’s my name for him.His name is Mr. Barley.But what a blessing it is for the son of my father and mother, to love a girl who has no relations, and who can never bother herself, or anybody else, about her family!”"
"赫伯特这么一说，我想起来了，他以前跟我说过，他认识克拉拉·巴利的时候，她正在哈默史密斯完成她的学业。后来她被叫回去照顾她父亲，他们便向慈母般的温博尔夫人表明了他们相互之间的爱慕之情。此后，温博尔夫人好心培养他们之间的这份感情，对二人同等对待，好心又慎重。凡是带温情的东西都不能跟巴利老头透露，因为他除了痛风、朗姆酒、事务长的库藏之外，对任何涉及心理层面的东西都不放在心上。","Herbert had told me on former occasions, and now reminded me, that he first knew Miss Clara Barley when she was completing her education at an establishment at Hammersmith, and that on her being recalled home to nurse her father, he and she had confided their affection to the motherly Mrs. Whimple, by whom it had been fostered and regulated with equal kindness and discretion, ever since.It was understood that nothing of a tender nature could possibly be confided to old Barley, by reason of his being totally unequal to the consideration of any subject more psychological than Gout, Rum, and Purser’s stores."
"我们就这样低声交谈，而巴利老头则在楼上连声大叫，喊得天花板上的横梁都震动了起来。这时门开了，进来一位十分美丽的姑娘。她二十岁上下，身段苗条、眼睛乌黑，手里提着个篮子。赫伯特走上前去，温柔地提过篮子，脸上一阵通红，跟我介绍说这是克拉拉。她果真是个十分迷人的姑娘，真像一个仙女，只可惜被巴利老头这个残忍的食人魔抓来使唤。","As we were thus conversing in a low tone while Old Barley’s sustained growl vibrated in the beam that crossed the ceiling, the room door opened, and a very pretty slight dark-eyed girl of twenty or so, came in with a basket in her hand: whom Herbert tenderly relieved of the basket, and presented blushing, as “Clara.”She really was a most charming girl, and might have passed for a captive fairy, whom that truculent Ogre, Old Barley, had pressed into his service."
"“看看这个，”我们谈了一会儿之后，赫伯特脸上露出了温柔、怜爱的笑容，指着篮子对我说，“这就是可怜的克拉拉的晚餐，每天晚上都吃这个。她只能吃这么一点面包，一片奶酪，一点朗姆酒——酒还是给我喝的。这是巴利先生明天的早餐，要拿去准备的。两块羊排、三块土豆、一些去壳的豌豆、一点面粉、两盎司黄油、一把盐、还有这些黑胡椒。把这些搁在一起煮，趁热吃下去，我看这倒是治痛风的妙方呢！”","“Look here,” said Herbert, showing me the basket, with a compassionate and tender smile after we had talked a little; “here’s poor Clara’s supper, served out every night.Here’s her allowance of bread, and here’s her slice of cheese, and here’s her rum—which I drink.This is Mr. Barley’s breakfast for tomorrow, served out to be cooked.Two mutton chops, three potatoes, some split peas, a little flour, two ounces of butter, a pinch of salt, and all this black pepper.It’s stewed up together, and taken hot, and it’s a nice thing for the gout, I should think!”"
"赫伯特一样一样地指着这些东西，克拉拉一样一样地看着，她顺从的眼神是那样自然，那样招人喜欢——赫伯特搂着她的腰，她顺从地任由他搂着，那样子满是信任、爱意和天真——她是这么温柔的一个姑娘，在密尔庞德岸叮当湾，老青铜绳索道这样一个地方，和那咆哮声震动横梁的巴利老头住在一起，是多么需要保护啊——即使以我那只从没打开过的皮夹子为代价，我也不能让赫伯特和她之间的姻缘被拆散。","There was something so natural and winning in Clara’s resigned way of looking at these stores in detail, as Herbert pointed them out,—and something so confiding, loving, and innocent, in her modest manner of yielding herself to Herbert’s embracing arm—and something so gentle in her, so much needing protection on Mill Pond Bank, by Chinks’ Basin, and the Old Green Copper Rope-Walk, with Old Barley growling in the beam—that I would not have undone the engagement between her and Herbert, for all the money in the pocket-book I had never opened."
"正在我满怀欣赏和赞叹之情看着她的时候，突然咆哮声又变成了一声怒吼。从上方传来可怕的撞击声，好像一个木头腿的巨人正试图穿过天花板，朝我们扑来。克拉拉一听，忙对赫伯特说：“父亲叫我呢，亲爱的！”然后就跑开了。","I was looking at her with pleasure and admiration, when suddenly the growl swelled into a roar again, and a frightful bumping noise was heard above, as if a giant with a wooden leg were trying to bore it through the ceiling to come to us.Upon this Clara said to Herbert, “Papa wants me, darling!” and ran away. "
"“这个没良心的老鲨鱼！”赫伯特说，“你猜他现在想要什么，汉德尔？”","“There is an unconscionable old shark for you!” said Herbert. “What do you suppose he wants now, Handel?”"
"“我不知道。”我说，“要喝酒？”","“I don’t know,” said I.“Something to drink?”"
"“没错！”赫伯特喊了起来，好像我猜对了什么了不起的大事一样。“他的酒早就调好了，放在桌上的小桶子里。一会儿就能听到克拉拉扶他起来喝酒。——他起来了！”接着又是一阵怒吼，结尾还拖着一声长长的颤音。接着是一阵沉默，“现在，”赫伯特说，“他喝了。咆哮声又一次在横梁上回响了起来。赫伯特说：“现在他又躺下了！”","“That’s it!” cried Herbert, as if I had made a guess of extraordinary merit.“He keeps his grog ready-mixed in a little tub on the table.Wait a moment, and you’ll hear Clara lift him up to take some.—There he goes!”Another roar, with a prolonged shake at the end.“Now,” said Herbert, as it was succeeded by silence, “he’s drinking.Now,” said Herbert, as the growl resounded in the beam once more, “he’s down again on his back!”"
"不久克拉拉就回来了，赫伯特陪我上楼去看这个被照料的人。我们经过巴利老头门口的时候，他正在里面用沙哑的嗓门哼着小曲，声音像风声一样忽高忽低，接着又唱起了副歌。我记下了这首曲子，不过有的地方做了些改动，改成了良好的祝愿。","Clara returned soon afterwards, and Herbert accompanied me up-stairs to see our charge.As we passed Mr. Barley’s door, he was heard hoarsely muttering within, in a strain that rose and fell like wind, the following Refrain; in which I substitute good wishes for something quite the reverse."
"“啊嗬！愿上帝保佑，这是比尔·巴利老头。这是比尔·巴利老头，愿上帝保佑。这是比尔·巴利老头，直挺挺地躺在床上，愿上帝保佑。直挺挺地躺在床上，像一只漂浮的、死去的老比目鱼，这是比尔·巴利老头，愿上帝保佑。啊嗬！愿上帝保佑。”","“Ahoy!Bless your eyes, here’s old Bill Barley.Here’s old Bill Barley, bless your eyes.Here’s old Bill Barley on the flat of his back, by the Lord.Lying on the flat of his back, like a drifting old dead flounder, here’s your old Bill Barley, bless your eyes.Ahoy!Bless you.”"
"我们听着他这支聊以自慰的曲子，赫伯特告诉我，这个不露面的巴利整日整夜地跟自己说话。为了便于他看河上的风光，他在床上安了一个望远镜。白天的时候，他就一只眼睛凑着望远镜，一边哼着曲子一边扫视河面。","In this strain of consolation, Herbert informed me the invisible Barley would commune with himself by the day and night together; often while it was light, having, at the same time, one eye at a telescope which was fitted on his bed for the convenience of sweeping the river."
"房子顶层有两间小卧室，空气清新，比楼下更不容易听到巴利先生的咆哮声。我在这里看到了普罗维斯，他舒舒服服地住在这里。他没有表现得很惊讶，他似乎一点也不觉得惊讶，但他变温和了，这点让我吃惊——我说不出原因，不但当时说不上来，就是事后怎么努力也说不上来，但他的确变温和了。","In his two cabin rooms at the top of the house, which were fresh and airy, and in which Mr. Barley was less audible than below, I found Provis comfortably settled.He expressed no alarm, and seemed to feel none that was worth mentioning; but it struck me that he was softened—indefinably, for I could not have said how, and could never afterwards recall how when I tried; but certainly."
"白天休息了一天，让我有机会好好思考，我下定决心，绝不在他面前提起康培生这个名字。因为我知道，他对康培生恨之入骨，我要是提起他，他可能会去找他拼命，结果只能是自取灭亡。所以，赫伯特、我和他在炉火边坐下后，我首先问他，相不相信温米克的判断和消息的来源。","The opportunity that the day’s rest had given me for reflection, had resulted in my fully determining to say nothing to him respecting Compeyson.For anything I knew, his animosity towards the man might otherwise lead to his seeking him out and rushing on his own destruction.Therefore, when Herbert and I sat down with him by his fire, I asked him first of all whether he relied on Wemmick’s judgment and sources of information?"
"“唉！唉！好孩子！”他重重地点了点头说，“贾格尔斯怎么会不识人。”","“Ay, ay, dear boy!” he answered, with a grave nod, “Jaggers knows.”"
"“那么，我跟温米克谈过了。”我说，“我过来把他给我的警告和建议跟你说说。”","“Then, I have talked with Wemmick,” said I, “and have come to tell you what caution he gave me and what advice.”"
"我把温米克的话一五一十地对他说了，只是没有提康培生的事。我跟他说，温米克在纽盖特监狱听说（至于是从官员那里还是从囚犯那里听来的，我不得而知）有人在怀疑他，我的房子也受到了监视。温米克建议他暂时躲一躲，不要和我接触，还说了温米克对我们送他出国的计划的看法。我补充说，当然，时机合适的话，我会和他一起走，或者他先走，我随后跟上，在温米克看来这或许是最安全的。至于出国以后怎么办，我没有提起，因为我自己脑子里也确实是一片混乱，此外。我见他已经变温和了，而且他分明是为了我才陷入了危险的境地。至于说要我改变生活方式，过得更阔气一点，我跟他说，我们目前的处境已经是动荡不安了，这时候摆阔岂不是荒唐可笑，而且可能把事情弄得更糟。","This I did accurately, with the reservation just mentioned; and I told him how Wemmick had heard, in Newgate prison (whether from officers or prisoners I could not say), that he was under some suspicion, and that my chambers had been watched; how Wemmick had recommended his keeping close for a time, and my keeping away from him; and what Wemmick had said about getting him abroad.I added, that of course, when the time came, I should go with him, or should follow close upon him, as might be safest in Wemmick’s judgment.What was to follow that, I did not touch upon; neither indeed was I at all clear or comfortable about it in my own mind, now that I saw him in that softer condition, and in declared peril for my sake.As to altering my way of living, by enlarging my expenses, I put it to him whether in our present unsettled and difficult circumstances, it would not be simply ridiculous, if it were no worse?"
"他无法否认这一点，而且他从头到尾的表现都的确很通情达理。他说，他回来本身就是一次冒险，他一直都知道这是一次冒险。他不会把这次的冒险变成死路一条，还说有这样稳妥的帮助，他一点也不担心自己的安全。","He could not deny this, and indeed was very reasonable throughout.His coming back was a venture, he said, and he had always known it to be a venture.He would do nothing to make it a desperate venture, and he had very little fear of his safety with such good help."
"之前一直盯着炉火沉思的赫伯特这时开口了，说温米克的建议让他想到了一个主意，或许值得一试。“汉德尔，我和你都是划桨的好手，等时机一到，我们可以自己划船送他出去。这样就不用雇船了，也不需要雇船夫，这样至少可以降低被人怀疑的可能性，我们要消除任何被怀疑的可能。不是划船的时令也不要紧，你马上开始准备一条船，停在坦普尔的石埠前，经常在河上划划，这个主意你觉得怎么样？等你养成了划船的习惯，还有谁会注意或在意呢？你划了二十次、五十次以后，那你的第二十一次、第五十一次又有什么不同呢？”","Herbert, who had been looking at the fire and pondering, here said that something had come into his thoughts arising out of Wemmick’s suggestion, which it might be worth while to pursue.“We are both good watermen, Handel, and could take him down the river ourselves when the right time comes.No boat would then be hired for the purpose, and no boatmen; that would save at least a chance of suspicion, and any chance is worth saving.Never mind the season; don’t you think it might be a good thing if you began at once to keep a boat at the Temple stairs, and were in the habit of rowing up and down the river?You fall into that habit, and then who notices or minds?Do it twenty or fifty times, and there is nothing special in your doing it the twenty-first or fifty-first.”"
"赫伯特的这个主意我很喜欢，普罗维斯更是振奋不已。我们同意把这个计划付诸实践，如果我们的船从伦敦桥下划过，往米尔庞德岸划去，普罗维斯千万不能跟我们打招呼。不过，我们进一步商量了一下，他如果看见了我们而且一切都好的话，就放下朝东的那扇百叶窗。","I liked this scheme, and Provis was quite elated by it.We agreed that it should be carried into execution, and that Provis should never recognize us if we came below Bridge and rowed past Mill Pond Bank.But, we further agreed that he should pull down the blind in that part of his window which gave upon the east, whenever he saw us and all was right."
"我们的商议就此结束，一切谈妥后我起身要走。走之前我对赫伯特说，我和他最好不要一起回去，我走后半小时他再动身。“我真不愿意把你一个人留在这里，”我对普罗维斯说，“虽然你呆在这里比在我身边安全，这毫无疑问。再见！”","Our conference being now ended, and everything arranged, I rose to go; remarking to Herbert that he and I had better not go home together, and that I would take half an hour’s start of him.“I don’t like to leave you here,” I said to Provis, “though I cannot doubt your being safer here than near me.Good-bye!”"
"“好孩子，”他紧紧握住我的手说，“我不知道我们什么时候能再见面，我不喜欢说再见。说晚安吧！”","“Dear boy,” he answered, clasping my hands, “I don’t know when we may meet again, and I don’t like Good-bye.Say Good Night!”"
"“晚安！赫伯特会经常为我们通信的，你放心，等合适的时机到了，我也准备好了。晚安，晚安！”","“Good night!Herbert will go regularly between us, and when the time comes you may be certain I shall be ready.Good night, Good night!”"
"我们觉得他最好呆在自己房间里，于是我们就在他门外楼梯的平台上告别，他举起一支蜡烛。照着楼梯栏杆，照亮我们下楼的路。我回头看了看他，想起了他回来的第一个晚上，那时我和他的位置和现在正好相反。那时我怎么也想不到，我此刻与他分别时，B147心情竟会如此沉重、如此焦虑。","We thought it best that he should stay in his own rooms, and we left him on the landing outside his door, holding a light over the stair-rail to light us down stairs.Looking back at him, I thought of the first night of his return when our positions were reversed, and when I little supposed my heart could ever be as heavy and anxious at parting from him as it was now."
"我们再次经过巴利老头房间门口的时候，他正在咆哮漫骂，没有停下来的迹象，也没有要停下来的意思。到了楼梯底下，我问赫伯特他是不是还用普罗维斯这个名字。他说，当然不是，大家只知道他是个叫坎贝尔的房客。他还说，人家只知道坎贝尔先生是由赫伯特照顾，赫伯特十分关心他的生活，想让他在这里过上清静的好日子。随后，我们走进客厅，看见温博尔夫人和克拉拉正坐在那里干活。我只字未提和坎贝尔先生相关的话，丝毫没有表现出对他的兴趣。","Old Barley was growling and swearing when we repassed his door, with no appearance of having ceased or of meaning to cease.When we got to the foot of the stairs, I asked Herbert whether he had preserved the name of Provis.He replied, certainly not, and that the lodger was Mr. Campbell.He also explained that the utmost known of Mr. Campbell there, was, that he (Herbert) had Mr. Campbell consigned to him, and felt a strong personal interest in his being well cared for, and living a secluded life.So, when we went into the parlor where Mrs. Whimple and Clara were seated at work, I said nothing of my own interest in Mr. Campbell, but kept it to myself."
"我告别了那位美丽温柔的黑眼睛姑娘，还有那位慈母般的妇人——她虽然上了年纪，但仍然真心实意地成全这一对恋人。我觉得老青铜绳索道都好像跟来的时候大不相同了。虽然巴利老头一把年纪，骂起人来粗野无比，但毕竟叮当湾还是到处洋溢着青春、信任和希望的。这时，我想起了埃斯特拉，想起了我们的分别，内心满是愁绪地回到了家。","When I had taken leave of the pretty gentle dark-eyed girl, and of the motherly woman who had not outlived her honest sympathy with a little affair of true love, I felt as if the Old Green Copper Rope-Walk had grown quite a different place.Old Barley might be as old as the hills, and might swear like a whole field of troopers, but there were redeeming youth and trust and hope enough in Chinks’ Basin to fill it to overflowing.And then I thought of Estella, and of our parting, and went home very sadly."
"坦普尔和往常一样安静。那边是普罗维斯最近住的房间，窗子里黑洞洞、静悄悄的，花园坊里一个散步的人+B161都没有。我在喷泉旁来来回回走了两三次，然后才上楼进门，但还是只有我一人。赫伯特后来回来了，走到我床前——我由于心情低落、疲惫不堪，一回去就上床了——他说他也没有发现什么异常。说完他打开了一扇窗，望望外面的月光，告诉我说路上空空荡荡的，和大教堂旁的路一样，这时候都是空无一人。","All things were as quiet in the Temple as ever I had seen them.The windows of the rooms on that side, lately occupied by Provis, were dark and still, and there was no lounger in Garden Court.I walked past the fountain twice or thrice before I descended the steps that were between me and my rooms, but I was quite alone.Herbert coming to my bedside when he came in—for I went straight to bed, dispirited and fatigued—made the same report.Opening one of the windows after that, he looked out into the moonlight, and told me that the pavement was a solemnly empty as the pavement of any Cathedral at that same hour."
"第二天我就着手去弄一条船。船很快就弄到了，泊在坦普尔石埠上。我从家里出来，只消走一两分钟就到了。之后，我开始出去练习划船：有时一个人，有时和赫伯特一起。我常常冒着严寒、雨雪出去划船，但划了几次，就没有人再怎么注意我了。起初我只在黑僧桥以西划，但后来涨潮的时间有了变化，我就把船一直划到伦敦桥。那时伦敦桥还是旧桥，在特定时期，潮水骤涨骤落，水情十分险恶。不过，在看过别人怎么过桥以后，我也掌握了这个技巧，就开始在普尔地区的大小船只中间划来划去，一直划到伊里斯。我第一次通过米尔庞德岸的时候，是赫伯特和我划双桨过去的，一来一回，我们两次都看见朝东窗户的百叶窗放下了。赫伯特通常每星期至少去看他三次，很少有例外，从没有带来让我惊心的消息。不过，我知道我的担心是有原因的，我始终放不下被人监视的念头。这个念头自从进入我脑中，就挥之不去。成为我的怀疑对象的、并无恶意的人简直数不胜数。","Next day, I set myself to get the boat.It was soon done, and the boat was brought round to the Temple stairs, and lay where I could reach her within a minute or two.Then, I began to go out as for training and practice: sometimes alone, sometimes with Herbert.I was often out in cold, rain, and sleet, but nobody took much note of me after I had been out a few times.At first, I kept above Blackfriars Bridge; but as the hours of the tide changed, I took towards London Bridge.It was Old London Bridge in those days, and at certain states of the tide there was a race and fall of water there which gave it a bad reputation.But I knew well enough how to “shoot” the bridge after seeing it done, and so began to row about among the shipping in the Pool, and down to Erith.The first time I passed Mill Pond Bank, Herbert and I were pulling a pair of oars; and, both in going and returning, we saw the blind towards the east come down.Herbert was rarely there less frequently than three times in a week, and he never brought me a single word of intelligence that was at all alarming.Still, I knew that there was cause for alarm, and I could not get rid of the notion of being watched.Once received, it is a haunting idea; how many undesigning persons I suspected of watching me, it would be hard to calculate."
"简而言之，对于那个隐匿的莽夫，我始终惶恐不安。赫伯特有时对我说，他发现在天黑退潮的时候，站在一扇窗口，想象着河水带着一切朝克拉拉流去，这种感觉很好。我则忧心忡忡，想象这河水是流向马格维奇的，河面上任何一个黑点都有可能是来追捕他的，飞快地、悄悄地、稳当地就把他抓住了。","In short, I was always full of fears for the rash man who was in hiding.Herbert had sometimes said to me that he found it pleasant to stand at one of our windows after dark, when the tide was running down, and to think that it was flowing, with everything it bore, towards Clara.But I thought with dread that it was flowing towards Magwitch, and that any black mark on its surface might be his pursuers, going swiftly, silently, and surely, to take him."
"第四十七章","Chapter 47"
"几个星期过去了，没有发生什么变故。我们等着温米克的到来，但是他一直没有露面。如果我和他的交情仅限于小不列颠的事务所，如果我从来没有去过他的宅子，和他没有私交，我可能会怀疑他，但我了解他的为人，我一刻也没有怀疑过他。","Some weeks passed without bringing any change.We waited for Wemmick, and he made no sign.If I had never known him out of Little Britain, and had never enjoyed the privilege of being on a familiar footing at the Castle, I might have doubted him; not so for a moment, knowing him as I did."
"我在世俗事务上的+B13前景不容乐观，债主一个接一个地找上门来。连我自己也开始认识到钱的紧缺了（我的意思是自己口袋里的现钱），于是变卖了一些舍得变卖的珠宝，换成现钱，以缓解手头的拮据。不过我打定主意，由于眼下我还没有明确的想法和打算，如果这时候还从我的恩主那里拿钱，我就是在无情地欺骗他。所以，我让赫伯特把那只没有打开过的钱包还给他，由他自己保管。自从他露面以来，我还没有从他的慷慨中获得什么好处，对于这一点，我感到有一种满足感——至于这种满足感是真的还是假的，我也不知道。","My worldly affairs began to wear a gloomy appearance, and I was pressed for money by more than one creditor.Even I myself began to know the want of money (I mean of ready money in my own pocket), and to relieve it by converting some easily spared articles of jewellery into cash.But I had quite determined that it would be a heartless fraud to take more money from my patron in the existing state of my uncertain thoughts and plans.Therefore, I had sent him the unopened pocket-book by Herbert, to hold in his own keeping, and I felt a kind of satisfaction—whether it was a false kind or a true, I hardly know—in not having profited by his generosity since his revelation of himself."
"随着时间的推移，一个想法沉重地压在我的心头。这个想法就是埃斯特拉已经结了婚。我很害怕这已成为事实，虽然这只是我的一个念头。我故意不看报纸，我恳求赫伯特再也不要在我面前提起她（我对他说过我和埃斯特拉上次会面的情形）。既然我的希望已经像一件七零八落的袍子，在空中片片飘散了，为什么我还要保留这最后一丝可怜的希望呢，我自己也说不上来！各位读者，你们不也曾做过类似的、前后矛盾的事情吗，就在去年，或者上个月，或者上星期，为什么要那么做呢？","As the time wore on, an impression settled heavily upon me that Estella was married.Fearful of having it confirmed, though it was all but a conviction, I avoided the newspapers, and begged Herbert (to whom I had confided the circumstances of our last interview) never to speak of her to me.Why I hoarded up this last wretched little rag of the robe of hope that was rent and given to the winds, how do I know!Why did you who read this, commit that not dissimilar inconsistency of your own, last year, last month, last week?"
"我的日子过得郁郁寡欢，总有一个忧虑位于所有忧虑之上，就像最高的那座山峰耸立在群山当中，无法从我的视野里消失。不过，目前还没有新的忧虑出现。这种忧虑让我夜里从床上惊起，担心他被人发现了；让我坐在屋子里惊恐地静听，担心赫伯特夜里回来的脚步声比往常急促，带回来坏的消息。可是尽管有这些忧虑，还有其他种种烦恼，日子还得过下去。我一筹莫展，老是忧心忡忡、疑虑重重，只得成天划着船荡来荡去，等待、等待、再等待。","It was an unhappy life that I lived, and its one dominant anxiety, towering over all its other anxieties like a high mountain above a range of mountains, never disappeared from my view.Still, no new cause for fear arose.Let me start from my bed as I would, with the terror fresh upon me that he was discovered; let me sit listening as I would, with dread, for Herbert’s returning step at night, lest it should be fleeter than ordinary, and winged with evil news; for all that, and much more to like purpose, the round of things went on.Condemned to inaction and a state of constant restlessness and suspense, I rowed about in my boat, and waited, waited, waited, as I best could."
"有时候潮情有了变化，我沿河而下，但老伦敦桥的桥拱和桥墩周围的漩涡很深，我没法把船划回去。我于是把船停在海关附近的一个码头上，过后再找机会把船划回坦普尔。我并不讨厌这么做，因为这样一来，住在河边的人对我和我的船就眼熟了。这样的事情虽小，却让我两次遇见了熟人，在这里我还是得说一下。","There were states of the tide when, having been down the river, I could not get back through the eddy-chafed arches and starlings of old London Bridge; then, I left my boat at a wharf near the Custom House, to be brought up afterwards to the Temple stairs.I was not averse to doing this, as it served to make me and my boat a commoner incident among the water-side people there.From this slight occasion, sprang two meetings that I have now to tell of."
"二月下旬的一个下午，黄昏时分，我在那个码头上了岸。我顺流而下，一直划到了格林尼治，然后逆流而上，又划回去了。那天是个不错的大晴天，但是太阳落山以后就起雾了，我只得小心翼翼地在前后的船只中摸索着回去。不过在一来一回的路上我都看见他窗口的信号了，一切平安无事。","One afternoon, late in the month of February, I came ashore at the wharf at dusk.I had pulled down as far as Greenwich with the ebb tide, and had turned with the tide.It had been a fine bright day, but had become foggy as the sun dropped, and I had had to feel my way back among the shipping, pretty carefully.Both in going and returning, I had seen the signal in his window, All well."
"晚上天气转凉，我觉得有些冷了，决定干脆吃个晚饭，暖暖身子再回去。而且想到回到坦普尔之后，我一个人要在沮丧和孤单中呆上好几个小时，我决定吃完晚饭后去看戏。沃甫赛先生大获成功的剧院就在那岸边（现在已经找不到了），虽然他的成功让人置疑，我还是决定到那家剧院去看看。我明白了，沃甫赛先生的成功不在于他振兴了戏剧，恰恰相反，他的成功在于他促进了戏剧的衰落。不出所料，他的名字果然在戏单上。他扮演的是一个忠心的黑人，他旁边是一位贵族小女孩，还有一只猴子。赫伯特见过他演的一个掠夺成性、滑稽可笑的鞑靼人，一张脸好像一块红砖，一顶骇人的帽子上缀满了铃铛。","As it was a raw evening and I was cold, I thought I would comfort myself with dinner at once; and as I had hours of dejection and solitude before me if I went home to the Temple, I thought I would afterwards go to the play.The theatre where Mr. Wopsle had achieved his questionable triumph, was in that waterside neighborhood (it is nowhere now), and to that theatre I resolved to go.I was aware that Mr. Wopsle had not succeeded in reviving the Drama, but, on the contrary, had rather partaken of its decline.He had been ominously heard of, through the playbills, as a faithful Black, in connexion with a little girl of noble birth, and a monkey.And Herbert had seen him as a predatory Tartar of comic propensities, with a face like a red brick, and an outrageous hat all over bells."
"我用餐的那家饭馆，赫伯特和我曾把它叫做“地理”饭馆——因为桌布上每隔半码就有一摊杯盘的印记，就像一幅幅世界地图，每把餐刀上都有肉汁的印记，就像航海图一样——如今，在市长的管辖范围内，已经很难找到一家不像“地理”饭馆的小饭馆了——我一会儿对着面包屑打盹，一会儿盯着煤气灯，一会儿在饭菜的热气里蒸着，就这样打发时间。这样没过多久，我起身往剧院走去。","I dined at what Herbert and I used to call a Geographical chop-house—where there were maps of the world in porter-pot rims on every half-yard of the table-cloths, and charts of gravy on every one of the knives—to this day there is scarcely a single chop-house within the Lord Mayor’s dominions which is not Geographical—and wore out the time in dozing over crumbs, staring at gas, and baking in a hot blast of dinners.By-and-by, I roused myself and went to the play."
"在剧院，舞台上出现了一位品行高尚的皇家水手长——一个了不得的人，尽管我希望他的裤子有些地方不要那么紧，有些地方不要那么松——他把那些小人物的帽子都打得压到了眼睛上，尽管他十分慷慨、十分勇敢、十分爱国，他却不许别人纳税。他口袋里装着满满一包+B42钱，像一块布丁包在布袋里一样，他就是用这些钱娶了一位穿着像床上用品的年轻姑娘，他还为此欣喜不已。整个朴次茅斯的人（根据上次的统计，一共是九个人）都来到海滩上，搓搓自己的手，又握握别人的手，唱道：“把酒斟上，把酒斟上！”可是，有一个肤色黝黑的家伙，就是不肯把酒斟上，别人要他做什么他也不做。水手长当众说道，这个人的心肠和他的脸皮一样黑。这个人于是和另外两个家伙谋划，要让大家不得安宁。他的计谋还真得逞了（这家伙家里颇有政治影响力），只花了半个晚上就准备好了。后来还是通过一个老实的小杂货商搞定的。他戴着白帽子，裹着黑绑腿，鼻子红红的，拿着一个烤肉架，钻进一个座钟里，一直躲在里面偷听，后来他从里面出来，谁要是驳不倒他偷听到的话，他就从后面用烤肉架敲谁的脑袋。这时沃甫赛先生出场了（他之前一直没有出场），他佩戴着星章和嘉德勋章，作为海军上将的全权代表发言，宣布当场逮捕这些家伙，把他们都关进监狱，还颁给水手长一面国旗，作为对他为国效忠的小小奖赏。水手长生平第一次失去了男子气概，毕恭毕敬地拿国旗擦干了眼泪，然后又高兴起来，称沃甫赛先生为法官大人，请求允许让他握一握手。沃甫赛先生庄重优雅地伸出手，立刻被水手长拉到了一个满是灰尘的角落，这时大家都在跳角笛舞。沃甫赛先生在那个角落里，用一种不满的目光扫视着观众，就在那时他发现了我。","There, I found a virtuous boatswain in his Majesty’s service—a most excellent man, though I could have wished his trousers not quite so tight in some places and not quite so loose in others—who knocked all the little men’s hats over their eyes, though he was very generous and brave, and who wouldn’t hear of anybody’s paying taxes, though he was very patriotic.He had a bag of money in his pocket, like a pudding in the cloth, and on that property married a young person in bed-furniture, with great rejoicings; the whole population of Portsmouth (nine in number at the last Census) turning out on the beach, to rub their own hands and shake everybody else’s, and sing “Fill, fill!”A certain dark-complexioned Swab, however, who wouldn’t fill, or do anything else that was proposed to him, and whose heart was openly stated (by the boatswain) to be as black as his figure-head, proposed to two other Swabs to get all mankind into difficulties; which was so effectually done (the Swab family having considerable political influence) that it took half the evening to set things right, and then it was only brought about through an honest little grocer with a white hat, black gaiters, and red nose, getting into a clock, with a gridiron, and listening, and coming out, and knocking everybody down from behind with the gridiron whom he couldn’t confute with what he had overheard.This led to Mr. Wopsle’s (who had never been heard of before) coming in with a star and garter on, as a plenipotentiary of great power direct from the Admiralty, to say that the Swabs were all to go to prison on the spot, and that he had brought the boatswain down the Union Jack, as a slight acknowledgment of his public services.The boatswain, unmanned for the first time, respectfully dried his eyes on the Jack, and then cheering up and addressing Mr. Wopsle as Your Honor, solicited permission to take him by the fin.Mr. Wopsle conceding his fin with a gracious dignity, was immediately shoved into a dusty corner while everybody danced a hornpipe; and from that corner, surveying the public with a discontented eye, became aware of me."
"第二个节目是最新的大型圣诞童话喜剧，第一场我就看见沃甫赛先生了，这让我觉得不是滋味。我一开始还怀疑是不是他，他腿上裹着红色的精纺毛袜，脸上的妆化得很夸张，还闪着磷光，头发是红色的窗帘边做的。他正在声响如雷的矿井里干活，而他人高马大的主人（声音十分嘶哑）回家吃饭的时候，他又露出十分怯懦的样子。好在他马上就扮演了一个身份较好的角色。有一个年轻的爱情天才需要帮助——这个小伙子爱上了一个农场主的女儿，但这个残暴、无知的农场主反对他女儿的选择，故意把自己套在面粉袋里，从二楼的窗口跳下，想压到小伙子身上——小伙子于是找来了一位好说教的巫师，向他求助。这位巫师从地球另一面风尘仆仆地赶过来，显然一路上历经艰险。原来这位巫师正是沃甫赛先生，他头上戴着一顶高高的帽子，腋下夹着一本巫术大全。这位巫师来到世上，他的主要任务就是听人家说话，听人家唱歌，让人家撞来撞去，看人家跳舞，任由人家在他面前挥舞各种颜色的焰火，他有的是时间。他只顾盯着我的方向，那样子像是惊呆了一样，看得我也惊讶不已。","The second piece was the last new grand comic Christmas pantomime, in the first scene of which, it pained me to suspect that I detected Mr. Wopsle with red worsted legs under a highly magnified phosphoric countenance and a shock of red curtain-fringe for his hair, engaged in the manufacture of thunderbolts in a mine, and displaying great cowardice when his gigantic master came home (very hoarse) to dinner.But he presently presented himself under worthier circumstances; for, the Genius of Youthful Love being in want of assistance—on account of the parental brutality of an ignorant farmer who opposed the choice of his daughter’s heart, by purposely falling upon the object, in a flour sack, out of the first floor window—summoned a sententious Enchanter; and he, coming up from the antipodes rather unsteadily, after an apparently violent journey, proved to be Mr. Wopsle in a high-crowned hat, with a necromantic work in one volume under his arm.The business of this enchanter on earth, being principally to be talked at, sung at, butted at, danced at, and flashed at with fires of various colors, he had a good deal of time on his hands.And I observed with great surprise, that he devoted it to staring in my direction as if he were lost in amazement."
"沃甫赛先生的眼睛越瞪越大，目光中大有深意，他好像想起了很多东西，在脑子里打转，把他弄糊涂了，弄得我也搞不清楚是怎么一回事了。他坐着一块硕大的表壳腾云而去，之后很长时间，我还坐在那里琢磨是怎么一回事，却始终想不出来。一小时以后，我走出剧院，还在琢磨这件事，发现他正在门口等着我。","There was something so remarkable in the increasing glare of Mr. Wopsle’s eye, and he seemed to be turning so many things over in his mind and to grow so confused, that I could not make it out.I sat thinking of it, long after he had ascended to the clouds in a large watch-case, and still I could not make it out.I was still thinking of it when I came out of the theatre an hour afterwards, and found him waiting for me near the door."
"“你好，”我和他握了握手，一同走到大街上。“我知道你看见我了。”","“How do you do?” said I, shaking hands with him as we turned down the street together.“I saw that you saw me.”"
"“看见你了，皮普先生！”他说，“是的，我当然看见你了。可还有一位是谁呀？”","“Saw you, Mr. Pip！” he returned.“Yes, of course I saw you.But who else was there?”"
"“哪里还有一位？”","“Who else?”"
"“这可就怪了，”沃甫赛先生说着，又露出了怅然若失的表情，“不过，我可以发誓，我看见他了。”","“It is the strangest thing,” said Mr. Wopsle, drifting into his lost look again; “and yet I could swear to him.”"
"我警觉了起来，恳求沃甫赛先生解释一下他这话什么意思。","Becoming alarmed, I entreated Mr. Wopsle to explain his meaning."
"沃甫赛先生继续用怅然若失的语气说：“如果你当时不在场，我不敢肯定一开始会不会注意到他，不过我想我应该会注意到他的。”","“Whether I should have noticed him at first but for your being there,” said Mr. Wopsle, going on in the same lost way, “I can’t be positive; yet I think I should.”"
"我不由自主地环顾了一下四周，就像我习惯回家前环顾一下四周一样，因为他这番神秘的话让我打了个寒颤。","Involuntarily I looked round me, as I was accustomed to look round me when I went home; for, these mysterious words gave me a chill."
"“噢！我们看不到他了，”沃甫赛先生说，“他走了，在我下场之前就走了，我看见他走的。”","“Oh!He can’t be in sight,” said Mr. Wopsle.“He went out, before I went off, I saw him go.”"
"我由于本来就心有疑虑，这下甚至怀疑起这个可怜的演员来了。我怀疑他是有意引诱我供出事实。所以，我只是瞟了他一眼，继续和他齐步前进，一句话也没有说。","Having the reason that I had, for being suspicious, I even suspected this poor actor.I mistrusted a design to entrap me into some admission.Therefore, I glanced at him as we walked on together, but said nothing."
"“说来可笑，我开始还以为他是和你一起来的，皮普先生，直到后来我发现你完全没有意识到他的存在，他像个鬼魂一样，就坐在你后面。”","“I had a ridiculous fancy that he must be with you, Mr. Pip, till I saw that you were quite unconscious of him, sitting behind you there, like a ghost.”"
"我又打了个寒颤，不过我下定决心不开口，从他的那番话来看，他很可能是受人唆使，引诱我把他所说的话和普罗维斯联系起来。当然，我十分肯定，普罗维斯没有去过剧院。","My former chill crept over me again, but I was resolved not to speak yet, for it was quite consistent with his words that he might be set on to induce me to connect these references with Provis.Of course, I was perfectly sure and safe that Provis had not been there."
"“我敢说我的话让你吃了一惊，皮普先生，我看你的确很吃惊。不过这真的很奇怪！我下面要跟你说的，你一定不会相信。如果换了你告诉我的话，我恐怕也不敢相信。”","“I dare say you wonder at me, Mr. Pip; indeed I see you do.But it is so very strange!You’ll hardly believe what I am going to tell you.I could hardly believe it myself, if you told me.”"
"“是吗？”我问。","“Indeed?” said I."
"“是的。皮普先生，从前有一年圣诞节，那时你还是个孩子，我在格雷戈里家吃饭，这时门外来了一帮士兵，要格雷戈里帮他们修手铐，你还记得吗？”","“No, indeed.Mr. Pip, you remember in old times a certain Christmas Day, when you were quite a child, and I dined at Gargery’s, and some soldiers came to the door to get a pair of handcuffs mended?”"
"“我记得很清楚。”","“I remember it very well.”"
"“他们当时在追两个逃犯，我们也跟着去了，格雷戈里一路上背着你，我在前面领路，你们在后面拼命跟着，你还记得吗？”","“And you remember that there was a chase after two convicts, and that we joined in it, and that Gargery took you on his back, and that I took the lead and you kept up with me as well as you could?”"
"“我都记得清清楚楚。”我记得比他还清楚——除了最后这一点。","“I remember it all very well.”Better than he thought—except the last clause."
"“我们在一条水沟里发现了他们两个，他们正打成一团，其中的一个被另一个打得很惨，脸都被抓破了，你还记得吗？”","“And you remember that we came up with the two in a ditch, and that there was a scuffle between them, and that one of them had been severely handled and much mauled about the face, by the other?”"
"“仿佛就在眼前。”","“I see it all before me.”"
"“后来那些士兵点起了火把，把那两个人推到中间，我们上去想看个究竟，在黑漆漆的沼泽地里，火光照着他们的脸——我特别要说的正是这一点，火光照着他们的脸，在黑漆漆的沼泽地里，你还记得吗？”","“And that the soldiers lighted torches, and put the two in the centre, and that we went on to see the last of them, over the black marshes, with the torchlight shining on their faces—I am particular about that; with the torchlight shining on their faces, when there was an outer ring of dark night all about us?”"
"“记得，”我说，“我都记得。”","“Yes,” said I.“I remember all that.”"
"“那么，皮普先生，今晚坐在你身后的就是这两个人中的一个。我越过你的肩头看见他了。”","“Then, Mr. Pip, one of those two prisoners sat behind you tonight.I saw him over your shoulder.”"
"“镇静！”我心里想着。然后我问他：“你看见的是两个人当中的哪一个？”","“Steady!” I thought. I asked him then, “Which of the two do you suppose you saw?”"
"“脸被抓破了的那个，”他不假思索地说，“我可以发誓，我看见的是他！我越想越肯定就是他。”","“The one who had been mauled,” he answered readily, “and I’ll swear I saw him!The more I think of him, the more certain I am of him.”"
"“这可真奇怪！”我竭力摆出一副与我无关的样子，说，“这可真是太奇怪了！”","“This is very curious!” said I, with the best assumption I could put on, of its being nothing more to me.“Very curious indeed!”"
"通过这一次的谈话，我心里增长的不安怎么描述也不算夸张，尤其是想到康培生曾“像个鬼魂”一样地坐在我后面，我的惊恐之情更是难以言表。如果说自从我把普罗维斯藏匿起来以来，他曾有过片刻没在我脑子里出现，而那一片刻正是当他离我最近的时候。想想我一贯来都小心谨慎，这个时候竟然这么粗心大意，就好像我关上了一百扇门，想把他关在外面，结果却发现他就在我身边一样。毫无疑问，他去剧院是因为我去了剧院，虽然我们周围好像没有什么危险，但事实上危险一直都近在咫尺，一触即发。","I cannot exaggerate the enhanced disquiet into which this conversation threw me, or the special and peculiar terror I felt at Compeyson’s having been behind me “like a ghost.”For, if he had ever been out of my thoughts for a few moments together since the hiding had begun, it was in those very moments when he was closest to me; and to think that I should be so unconscious and off my guard after all my care, was as if I had shut an avenue of a hundred doors to keep him out, and then had found him at my elbow.I could not doubt either that he was there, because I was there, and that however slight an appearance of danger there might be about us, danger was always near and active."
"我问了沃甫赛先生一些问题，比如，那个人是什么时候进来的。他答不上来，说他先看见了我，然后越过我的肩头看见了他。他看了好一会儿才认出他来，不过他一开始是把他和我联系到一起的，以为他是我从前在乡下认识的一个熟人。他穿着怎样？很讲究，但并不引人注目，记得他好像穿着一身黑衣服。他破相了吗？沃甫赛说没有。我也相信没有，因为尽管我当时在沉思，没有注意到我后面的人，但我想一张破了相的脸应该会吸引我的注意力的。","I put such questions to Mr. Wopsle as, When did the man come in?He could not tell me that; he saw me, and over my shoulder he saw the man.It was not until he had seen him for some time that he began to identify him; but he had from the first vaguely associated him with me, and known him as somehow belonging to me in the old village time.How was he dressed?Prosperously, but not noticeably otherwise; he thought, in black.Was his face at all disfigured?No, he believed not.I believed not, too, for, although in my brooding state I had taken no especial notice of the people behind me, I thought it likely that a face at all disfigured would have attracted my attention."
"凡是沃甫赛先生能记起的，凡是我能从他嘴里打探出来的，他都一五一十地告诉我了。忙了一个晚上，我请他吃了一点夜宵，然后我们就分开了。等我回到坦普尔，已经是介于凌晨十二点和一点之间了，坦普尔大门都已经关上了。我进了门，回到家，这一路上我周围都没有人。","When Mr. Wopsle had imparted to me all that he could recall or I extract, and when I had treated him to a little appropriate refreshment after the fatigues of the evening, we parted.It was between twelve and one o’clock when I reached the Temple, and the gates were shut.No one was near me when I went in and went home."
"赫伯特已经回来了，我们在炉火边十分严肃地商谈了一番。我们+B149没有商谈出结果，除了一点，那就是把我那晚的发现告诉温米克，告诉他我们等他出主意。我怕我去他的宅子去得太勤会连累他，于是决定写信跟他说。我上床之前把信写好了，出门把信投进了邮筒，这一次我周围还是没有人。赫伯特和我都认为，除了更加小心谨慎之外，我们别无它法。我们的确是十分小心——比以前还小心，要多小心有多小心——我再也不靠近叮当湾了，除了划船的时候会经过米尔庞德岸，即使经过，也只是朝那边望望，就跟朝别处张望一样。","Herbert had come in, and we held a very serious council by the fire.But there was nothing to be done, saving to communicate to Wemmick what I had that night found out, and to remind him that we waited for his hint.As I thought that I might compromise him if I went too often to the Castle, I made this communication by letter.I wrote it before I went to bed, and went out and posted it; and again no one was near me.Herbert and I agreed that we could do nothing else but be very cautious.And we were very cautious indeed—more cautious than before, if that were possible—and I for my part never went near Chinks’ Basin, except when I rowed by, and then I only looked at Mill Pond Bank as I looked at anything else."
"第四十八章","Chapter 48"
"我在上一章中提到过我两次遇到熟人，第二次发生在第一次之后大约一星期的时候。这一次我又把船泊在伦敦桥下的码头，时间是下午，比上次早一个小时。我还没决定去哪里吃饭，于是信步走到齐普塞德街上去闲逛，街上人来人往，我无疑是其中漂泊不定的一个，正在这时，有人从后面追上了我，一只大手放在我的肩头上。这是贾格尔斯先生的手，他索性挽住了我的胳膊。","The second of the two meetings referred to in the last chapter, occurred about a week after the first.I had again left my boat at the wharf below Bridge; the time was an hour earlier in the afternoon; and, undecided where to dine, I had strolled up into Cheapside, and was strolling along it, surely the most unsettled person in all the busy concourse, when a large hand was laid upon my shoulder, by some one overtaking me.It was Mr. Jaggers’ hand, and he passed it through my arm."
"“既然我们同路，皮普，那我们一起走吧。你要去哪里？”","“As we are going in the same direction, Pip, we may walk together.Where are you bound for?”"
"“应该是去坦普尔吧。”我说。","“For the Temple, I think,” said I."
"“你也不清楚吗？”贾格尔斯先生问。","“Don’t you know?” said Mr. Jaggers."
"“嗯，”在这次的盘问中我竟然占了上风，真是高兴，我说，“我也不清楚，我还没打定主意呢。”","“Well,” I returned, glad for once to get the better of him in cross-examination, “I do not know, for I have not made up my mind.”"
"“你总要吃饭吧？”贾格尔斯先生说，“我看，这你总不能否认吧？”","“You are going to dine?” said Mr. Jaggers.“You don’t mind admitting that, I suppose?”"
"“没错，”我说，“这我不否认。”","“No,” I returned, “I don’t mind admitting that.”"
"“你没有约什么人吧？”","“And are not engaged?”"
"“这我也不否认，我没有约人。”","“I don’t mind admitting also, that I am not engaged.”"
"“那么，”贾格尔斯先生说，“去我家和我一起吃吧。”","“Then,” said Mr. Jaggers, “come and dine with me.”"
"我正要找借口推辞，他加了一句：“温米克也会来。”所以我立刻调转话头，表示愿意接受他的邀请——好在我刚刚说出的几个字还没有表明立场，接受或者拒绝两种意思都可以接上——我们沿着齐普塞德街走下去，然后斜拐进了小不列颠街，这时街上的橱窗里纷纷亮起了明亮的灯光。傍晚时分，街上行人纷至沓来，点灯人里里外外爬上爬下，几乎连放置梯子的地方都找不到。于是，渐浓的雾气中张开了一只只红色的眼睛，越来越多，比上次我在汉姆斯旅馆投宿的时候，那灯芯草蜡烛塔投射到阴森森的墙上的、张开的一只只白眼睛还要多。","I was going to excuse myself, when he added, “Wemmick’s coming.”So, I changed my excuse into an acceptance—the few words I had uttered, serving for the beginning of either—and we went along Cheapside and slanted off to Little Britain, while the lights were springing up brilliantly in the shop windows, and the street lamp-lighters, scarcely finding ground enough to plant their ladders on in the midst of the afternoon’s bustle, were skipping up and down and running in and out, opening more red eyes in the gathering fog than my rushlight tower at the Hummums had opened white eyes in the ghostly wall."
"在小不列颠街的事务所里，临近下班，大家照常做着准备，有的写信，有的洗手，有的熄灯，有的锁保险箱，就这样结束了一天的工作。我站在贾格尔斯先生的火炉旁，无事可做。炉火上下跳跃，照在架上那两座头像上，看起来就好像它们在和我玩把脸一隐一现的躲猫猫的鬼把戏。那一对粗大的劣质蜡烛的微光照着贾格尔斯先生，他正在角落里写着什么。+B35蜡烛周身裹着一层裹尸布一般的脏纸，好像在纪念那些上了绞刑架的主顾。","At the office in Little Britain there was the usual letter-writing, hand-washing, candle-snuffing, and safe-locking, that closed the business of the day.As I stood idle by Mr. Jaggers’ fire, its rising and falling flame made the two casts on the shelf look as if they were playing a diabolical game at bo-peep with me; while the pair of coarse fat office candles that dimly lighted Mr. Jaggers as he wrote in a corner, were decorated with dirty winding-sheets, as if in remembrance of a host of hanged clients."
"我们三个上了一辆出租马车，往杰勒德街驶去，我们一到那里，晚饭就端上来了。虽说我想听一听温米克在沃尔沃斯的见解，但在那种地方，哪怕听一点也是我压根不敢想的。不过我时不时地以一种友好的方式跟他交换个眼色总是可以的吧。但这也办不到。他每次从桌上抬起头来，都把眼光投向贾格尔斯先生，对我则显得冷淡而疏远，那感觉就好像温米克有一个孪生兄弟，而今天来的正这个是他的兄弟。","We went to Gerrard-street, all three together, in a hackney coach: and as soon as we got there, dinner was served.Although I should not have thought of making, in that place, the most distant reference by so much as a look to Wemmick’s Walworth sentiments, yet I should have had no objection to catching his eye now and then in a friendly way.But it was not to be done.He turned his eyes on Mr. Jaggers whenever he raised them from the table, and was as dry and distant to me as if there were twin Wemmicks and this was the wrong one."
"“你把郝维仙小姐的信寄给皮普先生了吗，温米克？”贾格尔斯先生刚一用餐就问道。","“Did you send that note of Miss Havisham’s to Mr. Pip, Wemmick?” Mr. Jaggers asked, soon after we began dinner."
"“还没有，先生，”温米克说，“我正要去寄的，您就带皮普先生到事务所来了。信在这里。”他把信交给了他的负责人，而没有交给我。","“No, sir,” returned Wemmick; “it was going by post, when you brought Mr. Pip into the office.Here it is.”He handed it to his principal, instead of to me."
"“这是一封短信，皮普。+B54”贾格尔斯先生把信递给我说，“郝维仙小姐因为不确定你的住址，所以让我转交给你。她说她想见你，跟你谈一件你对她提过的小事。你会去见她吗？”","“It’s a note of two lines, Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, handing it on, “sent up to me by Miss Havisham, on account of her not being sure of your address.She tells me that she wants to see you on a little matter of business you mentioned to her.You’ll go down?”"
"“会的。”我答道，同时我看了一眼信，上面写的和他所说的一模一样。","“Yes,” said I, casting my eyes over the note, which was exactly in those terms."
"“你打算什么时候去？”","“When do you think of going down?”"
"“我眼下有一个约会，”我边说边瞟了一眼温米克，他正把一块鱼肉塞进他那邮筒似的嘴里，“所以我对我的时间安排还不确定。我想我很快就会去的。”","“I have an impending engagement,” said I, glancing at Wemmick, who was putting fish into the post-office, “that renders me rather uncertain of my time.At once, I think.”"
"“如果皮普先生打算马上就去的话，”温米克对贾格尔斯先生说，“您看，他就用不着回信了。”","“If Mr. Pip has the intention of going at once,” said Wemmick to Mr. Jaggers, “he needn’t write an answer, you know.”"
"我把他这话看成是一句暗示，暗示我最好不要耽搁，于是决定明天就去，并且把我的决定跟他们说了。温米克喝了一杯葡萄酒，带着一丝冷酷而满意的神情看了贾格尔斯先生一眼，但没有看我。","Receiving this as an intimation that it was best not to delay, I settled that I would go tomorrow, and said so.Wemmick drank a glass of wine and looked with a grimly satisfied air at Mr. Jaggers, but not at me."
"“这么说，皮普！我们的朋友蜘蛛先生，”贾格尔斯先生说，“出了手好牌。赢了这一局。”","“So, Pip!Our friend the Spider,” said Mr. Jaggers, “has played his cards.He has won the pool.”"
"我除了赞成之外，无话可说。","It was as much as I could do to assent."
"“哈！他是个有出息的家伙——他有他的办法——但他的办法不见得总是行得通。强者最终总是会取胜的，但谁是强者，现在还很难说。如果他一转变，要动手打她——”","“Hah!He is a promising fellow—in his way—but he may not have it all his own way.The stronger will win in the end, but the stronger has to be found out first.If he should turn to, and beat her—”"
"我一听他这话，顿时满面通红、怒火中烧，打断了他：“您不会真的认为他无耻到了要动手打她的地步吧，贾格尔斯先生？”","“Surely,” I interrupted, with a burning face and heart, “you do not seriously think that he is scoundrel enough for that, Mr. Jaggers?”"
"“我没有这么说，皮普。我只是这样假设。假如他动手打她，他很可能力气大占上风，假如要斗智力的话，他当然斗不过她。要想判断出在这样的情况下，那种人会做出什么反应，只能是碰运气，两种结果的可能性各占一半，因为这就好像投硬币猜输赢。”","“I didn’t say so, Pip.I am putting a case.If he should turn to and beat her, he may possibly get the strength on his side; if it should be a question of intellect, he certainly will not.It would be chance work to give an opinion how a fellow of that sort will turn out in such circumstances, because it’s a toss-up between two results.”"
"“我可以问一下是哪两种结果吗？”","“May I ask what they are?”"
"“一个像我们的朋友蜘蛛先生这样的人，”贾格尔斯先生说，“要么拳脚相加，要么畏畏缩缩。他可能一边畏缩一边咆哮，也可能只是畏缩不会咆哮，但他要么拳脚相加，要么畏畏缩缩。你问问温米克的意见吧。”","“A fellow like our friend the Spider,” answered Mr. Jaggers, “either beats, or cringes.He may cringe and growl, or cringe and not growl; but he either beats or cringes.Ask Wemmick his opinion.”"
"“要么拳脚相加，要么畏畏缩缩。”温米克说，看都没有看我一眼。","“Either beats or cringes,” said Wemmick, not at all addressing himself to me."
"“那么，我们为本特利·德鲁莫尔夫人干一杯吧。”贾格尔斯先生边说边从他的旋转碗餐台上取下一瓶上等葡萄酒，为我们斟满了，然后给自己也斟满了，“祝他们之间的胜负输赢问题解决得让夫人满意！既让夫人满意也让先生满意，这是不可能的。喂，莫利，莫利，莫利，你今天动作怎么这么慢！”","“So, here’s to Mrs. Bentley Drummle,” said Mr. Jaggers, taking a decanter of choicer wine from his dumb-waiter, and filling for each of us and for himself, “and may the question of supremacy be settled to the lady’s satisfaction!To the satisfaction of the lady and the gentleman, it never will be.Now, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, how slow you are today!”"
"他喊她的时候，她正在他旁边，端上了一道菜。菜上好后，她缩回双手，向后退了一两步，紧张地嘟囔了几句，像是为自己辩白。她说话的时候手指的一个动作吸引了我的注意。","She was at his elbow when he addressed her, putting a dish upon the table.As she withdrew her hands from it, she fell back a step or two, nervously muttering some excuse.And a certain action of her fingers as she spoke arrested my attention."
"“怎么了？”贾格尔斯先生问。","“What’s the matter?” said Mr. Jaggers."
"“没事。只是我们刚才谈论的话题，”我说，“让我心里很难受。”","“Nothing.Only the subject we were speaking of,” said I, “was rather painful to me.”"
"她手指的动作就像在编织什么。她站在一旁看着她的主人，不知道是不是可以走了，又怕他还有别的吩咐，走了以后又要叫她回来。她的表情很专注。无疑，这样一双眼睛，这样一双手，我最近刚刚在一个难忘的场合见过，简直一模一样！","The action of her fingers was like the action of knitting.She stood looking at her master, not understanding whether she was free to go, or whether he had more to say to her and would call her back if she did go.Her look was very intent.Surely, I had seen exactly such eyes and such hands, on a memorable occasion very lately!"
"他让她退下，她便轻轻地走出了房间。但她还是清清楚楚地停留在我眼前，就好像她还站在那里一样。我望着那双手，望着那双眼睛，望着那头秀发，在心里与我熟悉的那双手、那双眼睛、那头秀发相比较，心想，跟一个粗暴的丈夫过上二十年风雨飘摇的生活后，它们会变成什么样子。我又望了一眼这个管家妇的那双手和那双眼睛，想起了我最近一次在那荒芜的园子里散步（不是独自一人），经过废弃的酒坊时那种难以言表的心情。我想起了我看见一张脸从马车窗里探出朝我张望，一双手朝我挥舞时的情景。我又一次产生了同样的感受。我想起了我坐着马车——不是独自一人——驶过一条黑暗的街道，突然眼前出现了一片亮光，有如闪电一般，在我身边一闪而过的情景，我又一次体会到了这种感觉。我想到了由于一个联想，我弄清了剧院里坐我后面那个人的身份。我本来是不善于这样的联想的，现在却养成了联想的习惯，一提起埃斯特拉，我很快就想到她手指编织的动作，想到她专注的眼睛。我觉得我完全可以肯定，眼前这个妇人就是埃斯特拉的母亲。","He dismissed her, and she glided out of the room.But she remained before me, as plainly as if she were still there.I looked at those hands, I looked at those eyes, I looked at that flowing hair; and I compared them with other hands, other eyes, other hair, that I knew of, and with what those might be after twenty years of a brutal husband and a stormy life.I looked again at those hands and eyes of the housekeeper, and thought of the inexplicable feeling that had come over me when I last walked—not alone—in the ruined garden, and through the deserted brewery.I thought how the same feeling had come back when I saw a face looking at me, and a hand waving to me, from a stage-coach window; and how it had come back again and had flashed about me like Lightning, when I had passed in a carriage—not alone—through a sudden glare of light in a dark street.I thought how one link of association had helped that identification in the theatre, and how such a link, wanting before, had been riveted for me now, when I had passed by a chance swift from Estella’s name to the fingers with their knitting action, and the attentive eyes.And I felt absolutely certain that this woman was Estella’s mother."
"贾格尔斯先生看见过我和埃斯特拉在一起，此刻我不经意间流露出来的愁绪不太可能逃过他的眼睛。他听我说这个话题让我难受，点了点头，拍了拍我的背，又给大家斟上了酒，继续用他的晚餐。","Mr. Jaggers had seen me with Estella, and was not likely to have missed the sentiments I had been at no pains to conceal.He nodded when I said the subject was painful to me, clapped me on the back, put round the wine again, and went on with his dinner."
"这个管家妇后来只来过两次，在屋子里呆的时间也很短，贾格尔斯先生对她很尖刻。但是她的手和埃斯特拉的手是一样的，她的眼睛和埃斯特拉的眼睛也是一样的，即使她再出现一百次，我对于我的判断的信心，既不会多一分，也不会少一分。","Only twice more, did the housekeeper reappear, and then her stay in the room was very short, and Mr. Jaggers was sharp with her.But her hands were Estella’s hands, and her eyes were Estella’s eyes, and if she had reappeared a hundred times I could have been neither more sure nor less sure that my conviction was the truth."
"这个晚上过得很沉闷，温米克的酒只要一斟满，他端起来就喝光，就像在办理例行公事一样——只要一发工资，他大概也就是这样往口袋里一塞的——他眼睛望着他的上司，那坐姿仿佛是随时准备着接受盘问。至于说他的酒量，他那邮筒似的嘴就和别的邮筒一样，随时待命，只要邮筒里能塞进多少信件，他就能喝多少酒。依我看，今天坐在这里的始终是他那个孪生兄弟，只是外表像沃尔沃斯的温米克罢了。","It was a dull evening, for Wemmick drew his wine when it came round, quite as a matter of business—just as he might have drawn his salary when that came round—and with his eyes on his chief, sat in a state of perpetual readiness for cross-examination.As to the quantity of wine, his post-office was as indifferent and ready as any other post-office for its quantity of letters.From my point of view, he was the wrong twin all the time, and only externally like the Wemmick of Walworth."
"我们早早告了辞，一起离开了。我们在贾格尔斯先生那一堆靴子中找我们的帽子的时候，我觉得那个真正的温米克已经在回来的路上了。我们沿着杰勒德街，往沃尔沃斯方向走去，刚走了几码路，我就有一种感觉，觉得挽着我胳膊一起走的是真正的温米克，而他那个孪生兄弟已经消失在夜晚的空气里了。","We took our leave early, and left together.Even when we were groping among Mr. Jaggers’ stock of boots for our hats, I felt that the right twin was on his way back; and we had not gone half a dozen yards down Gerrard-street in the Walworth direction before I found that I was walking arm-in-arm with the right twin, and that the wrong twin had evaporated into the evening air."
"“好了！”温米克说，“没事了！他是个有本事的人，这世上难找第二个，不过我觉得跟他一起吃饭我得把嘴巴拧紧——而只有把嘴放开吃我才吃得舒服呢。”","“Well!” said Wemmick, “that’s over!He’s a wonderful man, without his living likeness; but I feel that I have to screw myself up when I dine with him—and I dine more comfortably unscrewed.”"
"我认为他这话一针见血，我便把这个意思跟他说了。","I felt that this was a good statement of the case, and told him so."
"“我这话可只对你讲，”他说，“我知道我们之间的话是不会外传的。”","“Wouldn’t say it to anybody but yourself,” he answered.“I know that what is said between you and me, goes no further.”"
"我问他有没有见过郝维仙小姐的养女——本特利·德鲁莫尔夫人。他说没有。为了避免话题转得太突然，我接着跟他问起老人家，还有司琪芬小姐。听我提起司琪芬小姐，他脸上露出狡黠的神色，当街停下脚步，擦了擦鼻子，晃了晃脑袋，挥了挥手帕，遮掩不住心里的一丝得意之情。","I asked him if he had ever seen Miss Havisham’s adopted daughter, Mrs. Bentley Drummle?He said no.To avoid being too abrupt, I then spoke of the Aged, and of Miss Skiffins.He looked rather sly when I mentioned Miss Skiffins, and stopped in the street to blow his nose, with a roll of the head and a flourish not quite free from latent boastfulness."
"“温米克，”我说，“你还记不记得，我第一次去贾格尔斯先生家之前，你让我留意一下那个管家妇？”","“Wemmick,” said I, “do you remember telling me before I first went to Mr. Jaggers’ private house, to notice that housekeeper?”"
"“我说过吗？”他问我，“呀，我的确说过。真糟糕，”他突然补充了一句，“我知道我说过。我发现我的嘴还拧得不够紧啊。”","“Did I?” he replied.“Ah, I dare say I did.Deuce take me,” he added, suddenly, “I know I did.I find I am not quite unscrewed yet.”"
"“一头被驯服的野兽，你是这么叫她的。”","“A wild beast tamed, you called her.”"
"“那你怎么叫她呢？”","“And what do you call her?”"
"“一样。贾格尔斯先生是怎么驯服她的，温米克？”","“The same.How did Mr. Jaggers tame her, Wemmick?”"
"“这是他的秘密。她跟着他很多年了。”","“That’s his secret.She has been with him many a long year.”"
"“我希望你能跟我说说她的身世。我对她的身世有一种特别的兴趣。你知道我们之间的话是不会外传的。”","“I wish you would tell me her story.I feel a particular interest in being acquainted with it.You know that what is said between you and me goes no further.”"
"“好吧！”温米克说，“我不了解她的身世——我是说，我不了解她全部的身世。不过我知道的，我都可以告诉你。当然，我们是从私人和个人的角度出发的。”","“Well!” Wemmick replied, “I don’t know her story—that is, I don’t know all of it.But what I do know, I’ll tell you.We are in our private and personal capacities, of course.”"
"“那当然。”","“Of course.”"
"“大约二十年前，那个女人在伦敦中央刑事法院受审，判了谋杀罪，后来无罪释放了。她是个十分端庄的年轻女人，我看她有吉普赛人的血统。不管怎样，她血性一上来，那情形你可以想象一下。”","“A score or so of years ago, that woman was tried at the Old Bailey for murder, and was acquitted.She was a very handsome young woman, and I believe had some gipsy blood in her.Anyhow, it was hot enough when it was up, as you may suppose.”"
"“可是，她无罪释放了？”","“But she was acquitted.”"
"“是贾格尔斯先生替她辩护的。”温米克的表情中大有深意，他接着说，“他这个案子处理得出人意料。这本来是一个无可挽回的案子，而且他那个时候事业才刚起步，他把这个案子处理得让人心服口服，事实上，可以说是这个案子成就了他。他天天往警察局跑，跑了好多天，要把这个女人的罪状一一开脱。开庭的时候，他还不具备出席的资格，于是就给辩护律师打下手——这个大家都知道——他每件事都亲自去做。被谋杀的是个女人，这个女人比莫利大了十岁，块头大得多，力气也大得多。这是个争风吃醋引起的案子。她们过的都是浪荡日子，这个住在杰勒德街的女人年纪轻轻就嫁人了，和一个浪荡汉做了露水夫妻，争起风、吃起醋来狂暴得很。这个被谋杀的女人——倒是跟那个男人更配，当然，这是就年龄来说的——被人发现死在豪恩斯洛荒原的一个牲口棚里。她死前经过了一番激烈的挣扎，也许是搏斗。她身上伤痕累累、皮开肉绽，最后是被人掐住喉咙，活活掐死的。案发之后，除了前面提到的那个女人，没有证据显示还有其他可疑的人了，但她不可能掐得死人，贾格斯尔先生主要就是抓住这一点来辩护的。你可能知道，”温米克碰了碰我的袖子，说，“虽然他现在有时候会说她手劲大，他以前可是绝口不提的。”","“Mr. Jaggers was for her,” pursued Wemmick, with a look full of meaning, “and worked the case in a way quite astonishing.It was a desperate case, and it was comparatively early days with him then, and he worked it to general admiration; in fact, it may almost be said to have made him.He worked it himself at the police-office, day after day for many days, contending against even a committal; and at the trial where he couldn’t work it himself, sat under Counsel, and—every one knew—put in all the salt and pepper.The murdered person was a woman; a woman, a good ten years older, very much larger, and very much stronger.It was a case of jealousy.They both led tramping lives, and this woman in Gerrard-street here had been married very young, over the broomstick (as we say), to a tramping man, and was a perfect fury in point of jealousy.The murdered woman—more a match for the man, certainly, in point of years—was found dead in a barn near Hounslow Heath.There had been a violent struggle, perhaps a fight.She was bruised and scratched and torn, and had been held by the throat at last and choked.Now, there was no reasonable evidence to implicate any person but this woman, and, on the improbabilities of her having been able to do it, Mr. Jaggers principally rested his case.You may be sure,” said Wemmick, touching me on the sleeve, “that he never dwelt upon the strength of her hands then, though he sometimes does now.”"
"我跟温米克说过，贾格尔斯先生有一次请我们吃晚饭的时候，让她把手腕伸出来给我们看。","I had told Wemmick of his showing us her wrists, that day of the dinner party."
"“嗯，老兄！”温米克接着说，“正巧——正巧，你明白吗？——这个女人自从案发被捕的那天起，就在穿着上下了大工夫，看起来比她原来纤瘦多了，特别是袖子，她把袖子弄得很巧妙，她的胳膊就显得特别纤细。","“Well, sir!” Wemmick went on; “it happened—happened, don’t you see?—that this woman was so very artfully dressed from the time of her apprehension, that she looked much slighter than she really was; in particular, her sleeves are always remembered to have been so skillfully contrived that her arms had quite a delicate look."
"她身上只有一两处伤痕——对一个游民来说这没什么——但她手背上有撕裂的伤疤，问题是，这会不会是被指甲抓伤的呢？贾格尔斯先生说，这是她穿过一大片荆棘丛的时候划伤的，这片荆棘丛的高度还够不着她的脸。但不用手也不可能穿得过去，何况在她皮肤上拔出了荆棘的刺可以作证；还有一个事实就是，后来到那片荆棘丛去一检查，发现果然有人进去过，还找到了她衣服上被撕扯下来的小碎片，还发现到处都有点点血迹。不过，接下来贾格尔斯先生提出了最为大胆的一条论据。为了试图证明她嫉妒成性，法庭提出她还有一个很大的嫌疑，那就是案件发生之前，她丧心病狂地杀害了她和那个男人生的孩子——一个大约三岁的孩子——只是为了报复那个男人。贾格尔斯先生是这样辩护的：‘我们说这些伤疤不是指甲抓伤的印记，而是荆棘划伤的，这一点我们到荆棘丛里做的调查已经证实过了。诸位说这些伤疤是指甲抓伤的印记，提出一种假设说她杀害了她的孩子。那么由这个假设引出的所有结论，诸位一定也会接受吧。假如说，她要杀害她的孩子，那么，孩子会紧紧抓住她不放，这就可能抓伤她的手。然后呢？诸位不是要审判她谋杀亲子的罪行吧？为什么不审一审呢？至于这个案子，如果诸位抓住伤痕这一点不放，我们认为，就我们所知，你们只是为了找个解释，好证明这些伤痕不是你们制造出来的吧！’总之，老兄，”温米克说，“贾格尔斯先生辩得整个陪审团都招架不住了，只得认输。”","She had only a bruise or two about her—nothing for a tramp—but the backs of her hands were lacerated, and the question was, was it with finger-nails?Now, Mr. Jaggers showed that she had struggled through a great lot of brambles which were not as high as her face; but which she could not have got through and kept her hands out of; and bits of those brambles were actually found in her skin and put in evidence, as well as the fact that the brambles in question were found on examination to have been broken through, and to have little shreds of her dress and little spots of blood upon them here and there.But the boldest point he made, was this.It was attempted to be set up in proof of her jealousy, that she was under strong suspicion of having, at about the time of the murder, frantically destroyed her child by this man—some three years old—to revenge herself upon him.Mr. Jaggers worked that, in this way.“We say these are not marks of finger-nails, but marks of brambles, and we show you the brambles.You say they are marks of finger-nails, and you set up the hypothesis that she destroyed her child.You must accept all consequences of that hypothesis.For anything we know, she may have destroyed her child, and the child in clinging to her may have scratched her hands.What then?You are not trying her for the murder of her child; why don’t you?As to this case, if you will have scratches, we say that, for anything we know, you may have accounted for them, assuming for the sake of argument that you have not invented them!”To sum up, sir,” said Wemmick, “Mr. Jaggers was altogether too many for the Jury, and they gave in.”"
"“她从此以后就为他干活吗？”","“Has she been in his service ever since?”"
"“是的，但不光是干活，”温米克说，“她一无罪释放就去他家干活了，被驯服成了现在这个样子。从那以后，她对于自己的职责是一样一样地学，不过她倒是从一开始就被驯服了。”","“Yes; but not only that,” said Wemmick.“She went into his service immediately after her acquittal, tamed as she is now.She has since been taught one thing and another in the way of her duties, but she was tamed from the beginning.”"
"“你还记得她那个孩子是个男孩还是女孩吗？”","“Do you remember the sex of the child?”"
"“听说是个女孩。”","“Said to have been a girl.”"
"“你今晚还有什么要跟我说的吗？”","“You have nothing more to say to me to-night?”"
"“没了。我收到了你的信，已经把它销毁了。没有别的事了。”","“Nothing.I got your letter and destroyed it.Nothing.”"
"互相衷心道了声晚安后，我便回家去了。我那些旧的苦恼还没消除，又添了新的愁思。","We exchanged a cordial Good Night, and I went home, with new matter for my thoughts, though with no relief from the old."
"第四十九章","Chapter 49"
"我把郝维仙小姐的信揣在口袋里，必要时可以拿出来作为凭证，免得她看见我这么快又到沙提斯庄园来了，就情绪不稳定地表示惊讶。第二天我又搭上了前往沙提斯庄园的马车。我在哈夫韦旅馆下了车，在那里吃了早饭，剩下的路是走着去的，因为我打算挑不常走的路悄悄到镇上去，离开的时候也打算如此。","Putting Miss Havisham’s note in my pocket, that it might serve as my credentials for so soon reappearing at Satis House, in case her waywardness should lead her to express any surprise at seeing me, I went down again by the coach next day.But I alighted at the Halfway House, and breakfasted there, and walked the rest of the distance; for, I sought to get into the town quietly by the unfrequented ways, and to leave it in the same manner."
"第五十章","Chapter 50"
"我的双手晚上换过两三次绷带，第二天早上又换了一次。我的左臂从手到胳膊肘这一段严重烧伤，从胳膊肘到肩膀这一段伤势稍轻些，整条胳膊疼得厉害。可是当时火势朝这个方向蔓延，我很庆幸没有伤得更厉害。我的右臂伤得没有这么严重，手指头还能动。当然，我的右手也缠上了绷带，虽然不方便，不过跟左手和左臂比起来还是要好得多。左臂用绷带吊着，大衣只能当披风穿，松松地披在肩上，在脖子上打个结。我的头发也着了火，好在头和脸幸免于难。","My hands had been dressed twice or thrice in the night, and again in the morning.My left arm was a good deal burned to the elbow, and, less severely, as high as the shoulder; it was very painful, but the flames had set in that direction, and I felt thankful it was no worse.My right hand was not so badly burnt but that I could move the fingers.It was bandaged, of course, but much less inconveniently than my left hand and arm; those I carried in a sling; and I could only wear my coat like a cloak, loose over my shoulders and fastened at the neck.My hair had been caught by the fire, but not my head or face."
"赫伯特到哈默史密斯去看过他父亲后，就回到我们的住所了，全天伺候在我身边。他是个绝好的护士，会定时帮我拆下绷带，把绷带浸在准备好的冷药水里，然后重新帮我包扎好，他的耐心和温柔让我感激不已。","When Herbert had been down to Hammersmith and seen his father, he came back to me at our chambers, and devoted the day to attending on me.He was the kindest of nurses, and at stated times took off the bandages, and steeped them in the cooling liquid that was kept ready, and put them on again, with a patient tenderness that I was deeply grateful for."
"起初，我静静地躺在沙发上，眼前总会出现熊熊的火光，耳旁总会响起大火燃烧的声音，还能闻到烧焦的味道，我发现要想摆脱这些十分困难，甚至可以说是不可能的。我刚睡着一分钟，就被郝维仙小姐的喊声惊醒，她朝我冲过来，头上窜起了比她还高的火焰。这种精神上的痛苦比任何身体上的痛苦都更加让人难以忍受。赫伯特看我这个样子，便想尽办法来转移我的注意力。","At first, as I lay quiet on the sofa, I found it painfully difficult, I might say impossible, to get rid of the impression of the glare of the flames, their hurry and noise, and the fierce burning smell.If I dozed for a minute, I was awakened by Miss Havisham’s cries, and by her running at me with all that height of fire above her head.This pain of the mind was much harder to strive against than any bodily pain I suffered; and Herbert, seeing that, did his utmost to hold my attention engaged."
"我们谁都没有提那条船，但我们心里都惦记着这件事。很明显，对这个话题我们都避而不谈，但我们一致同意——虽然没有明说——要让我这双手尽快康复，不需要等几个星期，最好几个小时就能康复。","Neither of us spoke of the boat, but we both thought of it.That was made apparent by our avoidance of the subject, and by our agreeing—without agreement—to make my recovery of the use of my hands, a question of so many hours, not of so many weeks."
"毫无疑问，我看见赫伯特问的第一个问题就是，河上住着的那个人是否一切都好？他信心十足、神采飞扬地回答我说一切都好，我们这一天就没有再谈论这个话题了。但是之后，当夜色渐浓，赫伯特帮我换绷带的时候，他不经意间又提到了这件事，当时窗外天色已经暗了下来，他是借着炉火的火光说的。","My first question when I saw Herbert had been of course, whether all was well down the river?As he replied in the affirmative, with perfect confidence and cheerfulness, we did not resume the subject until the day was wearing away.But then, as Herbert changed the bandages, more by the light of the fire than by the outer light, he went back to it spontaneously."
"“汉德尔，昨晚我和普罗维斯坐在一起，谈了足足两个小时。”","“I sat with Provis last night, Handel, two good hours.”"
"“那克拉拉呢？”","“Where was Clara?”"
"“可爱的小丫头！”赫伯特说，“她一晚上都围着凶老头子转呢。只要她一离开他的视野，他就没完没了地敲地板。不过我怀疑他撑不了多久了。成天不是朗姆酒配胡椒——就是胡椒配朗姆酒——我看他八成敲不了多久了。”","“Dear little thing!” said Herbert. “She was up and down with Gruffandgrim all the evening.He was perpetually pegging at the floor, the moment she left his sight.I doubt if he can hold out long though.What with rum and pepper—and pepper and rum—I should think his pegging must be nearly over.”"
"“那你们就要结婚了吧，赫伯特？”","“And then you will be married, Herbert?”"
"“不然，我怎么样照顾这可爱的小丫头呢？——你把胳膊张开搁在沙发背上，我坐在这里，慢慢地给你拆绷带，等拆完了连你自己都不知道。我刚刚说到了普罗维斯。汉德尔，他性子变好了，你知道吗？”","“How can I take care of the dear child otherwise?—Lay your arm out upon the back of the sofa, my dear boy, and I’ll sit down here, and get the bandage off so gradually that you shall not know when it comes.I was speaking of Provis.Do you know, Handel, he improves?”"
"“我跟你说过，我上次见他的时候就觉得他变温和了。”","“I said to you I thought he was softened when I last saw him.”"
"“你是说过。他的确变温和了。他昨晚很健谈，又跟我讲了很多他自己的经历。他上次提到过有一个女人让他十分头疼，话到嘴边又收回去了，你记得吧——我弄痛你了吗？”","“So you did.And so he is.He was very communicative last night, and told me more of his life.You remember his breaking off here about some woman that he had had great trouble with.—Did I hurt you?”"
"我惊动了一下，不过不是因为他弄痛了我。而是他的话让我猛然一惊。","I had started, but not under his touch.His words had given me a start."
"“我已经忘了，赫伯特，不过经你这么一提醒，我倒是想起来了。”","“I had forgotten that, Herbert, but I remember it now you speak of it.”"
"“嗯！他跟我讲了他的这一段经历，这段经历可真够黑暗、真够疯狂的。要不要我说给你听？现在跟你说，你会不会心烦？”","“Well!He went into that part of his life, and a dark wild part it is.Shall I tell you?Or would it worry you just now?”"
"“你一定要跟我说。一个字也不要漏掉。”","“Tell me by all means.Every word.”"
"赫伯特弯下身子，凑近来仔细瞧了瞧我，好像我回答地这样急切，让他难以理解似的。“你还清醒吧？”他摸了摸我的头，问道。","Herbert bent forward to look at me more nearly, as if my reply had been rather more hurried or more eager than he could quite account for.“Your head is cool?” he said, touching it. "
"“很清醒，”我说，“告诉我普罗维斯都说了什么，我亲爱的赫伯特。”","“Quite,” said I.“Tell me what Provis said, my dear Herbert.”"
"“看来，”赫伯特说，“——这条绷带扯得好极了，现在给你换条清凉的——一开始你的胳膊会忍不住收缩，我可怜的老兄，是不是？不过马上就会舒服了——看来那个女人是个年轻的女人，一个爱吃醋的女人，一个爱报复女人，爱报复，汉德尔，报复心极强。”","“It seems,” said Herbert, “—there’s a bandage off most charmingly, and now comes the cool one—makes you shrink at first, my poor dear fellow, don’t it?But it will be comfortable presently—it seems that the woman was a young woman, and a jealous woman, and a revengeful woman; revengeful, Handel, to the last degree.”"
"“怎么个强法？”","“To what last degree?”"
"“杀人。——绷带贴在肉上是不是很凉？”","“Murder.—Does it strike too cold on that sensitive place?”"
"“我没感觉到。她是怎么杀人的？她杀了谁？”","“I don’t feel it.How did she murder?Whom did she murder?”"
"“唉，这事不见得能构成这么大的罪名。”赫伯特说，“不过，人们还是以谋杀罪起诉了她。是贾格尔斯先生为她辩护的，他因为这场辩护出了名，普罗维斯也因此知道了贾格尔斯这个人。受害人是另外一个大块头的女人，两人有过一场搏斗——在一间牲口棚里。是谁先动的手，搏斗是光明正大的，还是偷偷摸摸的，都还是疑问，不过搏斗的结果却是明明白白，那就是受害人是被掐死的。”","“Why, the deed may not have merited quite so terrible a name,” said Herbert, “but, she was tried for it, and Mr. Jaggers defended her, and the reputation of that defense first made his name known to Provis.It was another and a stronger woman who was the victim, and there had been a struggle—in a barn.Who began it, or how fair it was, or how unfair, may be doubtful; but how it ended, is certainly not doubtful, for the victim was found throttled.”"
"“这个女人判罪了吗？”","“Was the woman brought in guilty?”"
"“没有，她无罪释放了——我可怜的汉德尔，我弄痛你了！”","“No; she was acquitted.—My poor Handel, I hurt you!”"
"“你动作轻得不能再轻了，赫伯特。她无罪释放了？后来呢？”","“It is impossible to be gentler, Herbert.Yes?What else?”"
"“这个无罪释放的年轻女人给普罗维斯生了一个孩子。普罗维斯十分喜欢这个孩子。我刚才说了，这个女人掐死了她的情敌，就在那天晚上，她去找普罗维斯见了短短的一面，发誓说她要弄死那个孩子（孩子当时跟她在一起），这样他就再也见不到孩子了，说完她就走了——这条伤得最重的胳膊已经重新包扎好并吊好了，现在就剩下右边的胳膊了，这边好弄多了。我宁可在这种灯光下包扎，也比在强光下好，这样我看不清你那一块块可怜的水泡，我的手就不会抖——老兄，你有没有觉得你的呼吸有点不对劲？你好像呼吸得很急促。”","“This acquitted young woman and Provis had a little child: a little child of whom Provis was exceedingly fond.On the evening of the very night when the object of her jealousy was strangled as I tell you, the young woman presented herself before Provis for one moment, and swore that she would destroy the child (which was in her possession), and he should never see it again; then, she vanished.—There’s the worst arm comfortably in the sling once more, and now there remains but the right hand, which is a far easier job.I can do it better by this light than by a stronger, for my hand is steadiest when I don’t see the poor blistered patches too distinctly.—You don’t think your breathing is affected, my dear boy?You seem to breathe quickly.”"
"“可能吧，赫伯特。那个女人发的誓兑现了吗？”","“Perhaps I do, Herbert.Did the woman keep her oath?”"
"“那是普罗维斯一生中经历的最黑暗的时期。她果然履行了她的誓言。”","“There comes the darkest part of Provis’ life.She did.”"
"“也就是说，他说她兑现了誓言。”","“That is, he says she did.”"
"“怎么，当然了，我的老兄。”赫伯特又一次凑到我跟前，仔细瞧了瞧我，语气中透露出惊讶之情，“都是他自己说的。我没从别处获得情报。”","“Why, of course, my dear boy,” returned Herbert, in a tone of surprise, and again bending forward to get a nearer look at me.“He says it all.I have no other information.”"
"“当然，那是。”","“No, to be sure.”"
"“至于，”赫伯特接着说道，“他对这个孩子的母亲是好还是坏，普罗维斯没有说。不过，她跟他一起过了四五年受罪的日子，这个他上次跟我们说过，就在这壁炉前说的。他好像很同情她，对她也很体谅。所以，他因为害怕被传唤出庭作证，证明她害死了那个孩子，判她死罪，就躲起来了（虽然那孩子的死让他伤心得要命）。用他自己的话说，就是避不见人，避不出庭。说起两个女人争风吃醋的原因，他只含糊地说是为了一个叫埃布尔的男人。她无罪释放以后就失踪了，从此他就失去了他的孩子和孩子的母亲。”","“Now, whether,” pursued Herbert, “he had used the child’s mother ill, or whether he had used the child’s mother well, Provis doesn’t say; but, she had shared some four or five years of the wretched life he described to us at this fireside, and he seems to have felt pity for her, and forbearance towards her.Therefore, fearing he should be called upon to depose about this destroyed child, and so be the cause of her death, he hid himself (much as he grieved for the child), kept himself dark, as he says, out of the way and out of the trial, and was only vaguely talked of as a certain man called Abel, out of whom the jealousy arose.After the acquittal she disappeared, and thus he lost the child and the child’s mother.”"
"“我想问一下——”","“I want to ask—”"
"“等一下，老兄，我马上说完。那个恶棍康培生，那个无赖中的无赖，知道他当时正在躲避风头，也知道他这么做的原因，当然就抓住他的把柄要挟他，让他日子过得越来越穷，活干得越来越多。昨晚听他这么一说，我才明白为什么普罗维斯对康培生有那么大的仇恨。”","“A moment, my dear boy, and I have done.That evil genius, Compeyson, the worst of scoundrels among many scoundrels, knowing of his keeping out of the way at that time, and of his reasons for doing so, of course afterwards held the knowledge over his head as a means of keeping him poorer, and working him harder.It was clear last night that this barbed the point of Provis’ animosity.”"
"“我想知道，”我说，“我特别想知道的是，赫伯特，他有没有跟你说这是什么时候的事？”","“I want to know,” said I, “and particularly, Herbert, whether he told you when this happened?”"
"“特别想知道？那让我想想，他是怎么说的。他是这么说的，‘大约二十年前，差不多就是我开始跟康培生混的时候。’你在教堂的小墓地见到他的时候多大？”","“Particularly?Let me remember, then, what he said as to that.His expression was, ‘a round score o’ year ago, and a’most directly after I took up wi’ Compeyson.’How old were you when you came upon him in the little churchyard?”"
"“我想那个时候我七岁了吧。”","“I think in my seventh year.”"
"“唉。他说，他见到你是在那件事发生三四年以后，你让他想起了他那死得好惨的小女儿。她如果还在世的话，应该和你一般大了。”","“Ay.It had happened some three or four years then, he said, and you brought into his mind the little girl so tragically lost, who would have been about your age.”"
"“赫伯特，”我沉默了一会儿，匆匆说道，“你是凑着窗外射进来的光看我看得清楚，还是凑着炉火的光看得清楚？”","“Herbert,” said I, after a short silence, in a hurried way, “can you see me best by the light of the window, or the light of the fire?”"
"“凑着炉火的光看得更清楚。”赫伯特说着，又一次把身子凑了过来。","“By the firelight,” answered Herbert, coming close again."
"“看着我。”","“Look at me.”"
"“我看着你呢，老兄。”","“I do look at you, my dear boy.”"
"“碰一下我。”","“Touch me.”"
"“我碰着你呢，老兄。”","“I do touch you, my dear boy.”"
"“你相信我现在没有发烧，也没有被昨晚那场大火烧得神经错乱吧？”","“You are not afraid that I am in any fever, or that my head is much disordered by the accident of last night?”"
"“我相信，老兄。”赫伯特上上下下打量了我一番后，说道，“你很兴奋，但神志很清醒。”","“N-no, my dear boy,” said Herbert, after taking time to examine me.“You are rather excited, but you are quite yourself.”"
"“我知道我神志很清醒。我们藏在河上的那个人，正是埃斯特拉的父亲。”","“I know I am quite myself.And the man we have in hiding down the river, is Estella’s Father.”"
"第五十一章","Chapter 51"
"我满腔热情地追寻埃斯特拉亲生父母的身份，至于我这么做的原因，我自己也说不清楚。诸位读者，你们不久就会明白，关于这个问题，一直要等到一位比我明智的人指点之后，我心里才会有个谱。","What purpose I had in view when I was hot on tracing out and proving Estella’s parentage, I cannot say.It will presently be seen that the question was not before me in a distinct shape, until it was put before me by a wiser head than my own."
"不过，在赫伯特和我展开那次意义重大的交谈之后，我有了一个狂热的想法，那就是我非把这件事查个水落石出不可——不能就此作罢，不过我得先见一见贾格尔斯先生，从他那里得知事情的真相。我真不知道我这么做是为了埃斯特拉，还是为了我竭力保护的那一位，想让他知道几分多年来关于她的富于传奇色彩的谜团。或许后一种可能更接近真相。","But, when Herbert and I had held our momentous conversation, I was seized with a feverish conviction that I ought to hunt the matter down—that I ought not to let it rest, but that I ought to see Mr. Jaggers, and come at the bare truth.I really do not know whether I felt that I did this for Estella’s sake, or whether I was glad to transfer to the man in whose preservation I was so much concerned, some rays of the romantic interest that had so long surrounded her.Perhaps the latter possibility may be the nearer to the truth."
"不管怎样，我恨不得连夜就往杰勒德街赶去。赫伯特说，假如我这么做了，我可能会落得个一病不起，还要靠人照顾，而那个逃犯的性命安全可都依赖我呢。他这么一说，便把我那急性子给按捺住了。赫伯特一遍又一遍地答应我，不管发生什么，明天一定让我去找贾格尔斯先生，我最终才同意不再做声，让他帮我处理伤口，我在家好好休息一晚。第二天一早我们一起出门，在吉尔茨普街角和史密斯菲尔德广场的交叉口道了别。赫伯特前去伦敦金融城，我则往小不列颠街走去。","Any way, I could scarcely be withheld from going out to Gerrard-street that night.Herbert’s representations that if I did, I should probably be laid up and stricken useless, when our fugitive’s safety would depend upon me, alone restrained my impatience.On the understanding, again and again reiterated, that come what would, I was to go to Mr. Jaggers tomorrow, I at length submitted to keep quiet, and to have my hurts looked after, and to stay at home.Early next morning we went out together, and at the corner of Giltspur-street by Smithfield, I left Herbert to go his way into the City, and took my way to Little Britain."
"贾格尔斯先生和温米克会定期核查事务所的账目，核对收据，并把各种账目一一整理好。每到这种时候，温米克就会带着他的账本和票据到贾格尔斯先生的办公室，楼上就会下来一位职员，到外间办公室去坐着。那天早上我发现温米克座位上坐着楼上的一个办事员，就知道他们正在干什么。不过，贾格尔斯先生和温米克在一起倒也没什么不好，这样温米克可以当面听听我要跟贾格尔斯先生说的话，知道我一句也没有牵扯到他。","There were periodical occasions when Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick went over the office accounts, and checked off the vouchers, and put all things straight.On these occasions Wemmick took his books and papers into Mr. Jaggers’ room, and one of the up-stairs clerks came down into the outer office.Finding such clerk on Wemmick’s post that morning, I knew what was going on; but, I was not sorry to have Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick together, as Wemmick would then hear for himself that I said nothing to compromise him."
"我胳膊上缠了绷带，大衣松松地披在肩上，我就以这副样子出现在他们面前。虽然我昨天一进城就给贾格尔斯先生寄了一封短信，简单说了一下这次事故，不过现在我得跟他讲讲这件事的始末。在这样的情形下，我们的谈话不同以往，不那么生硬，也不必严格遵守有依有据的原则。我在描述这场事故的时候，贾格尔斯先生像往常一样在火炉前边站着。温米克背靠在椅子上，两眼盯着我，双手插在裤子口袋里，那张邮筒似的嘴里横咬着一支笔。至于那两个可怕的人，我脑海中老想着它们要插手事务所的事，它们现在看起来满脑子都在想着它们怎么没有闻到火的气味。","My appearance with my arm bandaged and my coat loose over my shoulders, favored my object.Although I had sent Mr. Jaggers a brief account of the accident as soon as I had arrived in town, yet I had to give him all the details now; and the speciality of the occasion caused our talk to be less dry and hard, and less strictly regulated by the rules of evidence, than it had been before.While I described the disaster, Mr. Jaggers stood, according to his wont, before the fire.Wemmick leaned back in his chair, staring at me, with his hands in the pockets of his trousers, and his pen put horizontally into the post.The two brutal casts, always inseparable in my mind from the official proceedings, seemed to be congestively considering whether they didn’t smell fire at the present moment."
"我要讲的都讲完了，他们要问的也都问完了，我这才拿出郝维仙小姐给我的凭证，来领取给赫伯特的九百英磅。我把象牙簿递给贾格尔斯先生的时候，他的眼珠向眼窝里陷进去了一些。不过他立即就把象牙簿交给温米克，让他去开张支票，开好后给他签字。温米克开支票的时候，我看了看他，又看了看贾格尔斯先生，后者穿着擦得油光发亮的皮靴，抖动着双腿，同时竭力保持身体平衡，在一旁看着我。“我很抱歉，皮普，”我把他签好字的支票放进口袋，这时他对我说，“我们没能帮上你的忙。”","My narrative finished, and their questions exhausted, I then produced Miss Havisham’s authority to receive the nine hundred pounds for Herbert.Mr. Jaggers’ eyes retired a little deeper into his head when I handed him the tablets, but he presently handed them over to Wemmick, with instructions to draw the check for his signature.While that was in course of being done, I looked on at Wemmick as he wrote, and Mr. Jaggers, poising and swaying himself on his well-polished boots, looked on at me.“I am sorry, Pip,” said he, as I put the check in my pocket, when he had signed it, “that we do nothing for you.”"
"“郝维仙小姐也很好心地问过我，”我说，“问我需不需要她帮什么忙，我说不需要。”","“Miss Havisham was good enough to ask me,” I returned, “whether she could do nothing for me, and I told her No.”"
"“每个人都应该了解他自己的事情。”贾格尔斯先生说。我看见温米克的嘴唇做出了“动产”的口型。","“Everybody should know his own business,” said Mr. Jaggers.And I saw Wemmick’s lips form the words “portable property.”"
"“我要是你，就不会回答她说不需要。”贾格尔斯先生说，“不过每个人都应该最了解他自己的事情。”","“I should not have told her No, if I had been you,” said Mr Jaggers; “but every man ought to know his own business best.”"
"“每个人自己的事情，”温米克用极其责备的口气对我说，“就是动产。”","“Every man’s business,” said Wemmick, rather reproachfully towards me, “is portable property.”"
"我想是时候提出我心里的疑问了，我转向贾格尔斯先生，问道：","As I thought the time was now come for pursuing the theme I had at heart, I said, turning on Mr. Jaggers:"
"“不过，先生，我的确问过郝维仙小姐一些问题。我要她告诉我一些有关她养女的事情，她把她知道的都告诉我了。”","“I did ask something of Miss Havisham, however, sir.I asked her to give me some information relative to her adopted daughter, and she gave me all she possessed.”"
"“她都告诉你了？”贾格尔斯先生一边问一边俯身看了看他的靴子，然后直起了身子，“哈！我要是郝维仙小姐，我想我是不会这么做的。不过她应该最了解她自己的事情。”","“Did she?” said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward to look at his boots and then straightening himself.“Hah! I don’t think I should have done so, if I had been Miss Havisham.But she ought to know her own business best.”"
"“关于她养女的身世，我知道的比郝维仙小姐本人知道的还多，先生。我知道她的母亲是谁。”","“I know more of the history of Miss Havisham’s adopted child, than Miss Havisham herself does, sir.I know her mother.”"
"贾格尔斯先生疑惑地看着我，重复了一句：“她的母亲？”","Mr. Jaggers looked at me inquiringly, and repeated “Mother?”"
"“我就在三天前还见过她母亲。”","“I have seen her mother within these three days.”"
"“是吗？”贾格尔斯先生说。","“Yes?” said Mr. Jaggers."
"“您也见过的，先生。您上一次见她的时候比我还要近呢。”","“And so have you, sir.And you have seen her still more recently.”"
"“是吗？”贾格尔斯先生说。","“Yes?” said Mr. Jaggers."
"“或许我对埃斯特拉的身世了解得比您还多。”我说，“我还知道她的父亲是谁。”","“Perhaps I know more of Estella’s history than even you do,” said I.“I know her father too.”"
"贾格尔斯先生听了我这话愣了一下——他十分有自制力，喜怒不形于色，不过还是忍不住表现出了一丝凝神注意的神色——从这一点我得以肯定，他并不知道她的父亲是谁。普罗维斯说他从那以后就尽量避不见人（赫伯特重申了这一点），这一点很有力地肯定了我的猜测。再加上他当时还不是贾格尔斯先生的客户，他是大约四年后才找贾格尔斯先生为他办事的，而且他也没有理由向他透露自己的身份。不过，之前我还不能确定贾格尔斯先生不明其中的真相，而现在我已经很有把握了。","A certain stop that Mr. Jaggers came to in his manner—he was too self-possessed to change his manner, but he could not help its being brought to an indefinably attentive stop—assured me that he did not know who her father was.This I had strongly suspected from Provis’ account (as Herbert had repeated it) of his having kept himself dark; which I pieced on to the fact that he himself was not Mr. Jaggers’ client until some four years later, and when he could have no reason for claiming his identity.But, I could not be sure of this unconsciousness on Mr. Jaggers’ part before, though I was quite sure of it now."
"“这么说！你认识这位年轻女士的父亲，皮普？”贾格尔斯先生说。","“So!You know the young lady’s father, Pip?” said Mr. Jaggers. "
"“是的，”我说，“他的名字叫做普罗维斯——来自新南威尔士。”","“Yes,” I replied, “and his name is Provis—from New South Wales.”"
"就连贾格尔斯先生听了我的话之后也吃了一惊。他的惊讶之情很难被察觉，他很好地把它抑制住了，并且很快就觉察不到了，但他的确吃了一惊，尽管他掏出了手帕，想借这个动作来掩饰。至于温米克听到这个消息有什么反应，我不知道，因为我当时不敢看他，生怕贾格尔斯先生犀利的眼光察觉出我们瞒着他有一些私下的往来。","Even Mr. Jaggers started when I said those words.It was the slightest start that could escape a man, the most carefully repressed and the soonest checked, but he did start, though he made it a part of the action of taking out his pocket-handkerchief.How Wemmick received the announcement I am unable to say, for I was afraid to look at him just then, lest Mr. Jaggers’ sharpness should detect that there had been some communication unknown to him between us."
"“皮普，”贾格尔斯先生的手帕还没碰到鼻子，在半空中停住了，镇定自若地问道，“普罗维斯这么说有什么证据吗？”","“And on what evidence, Pip,” asked Mr. Jaggers, very coolly, as he paused with his handkerchief half way to his nose, “does Provis make this claim?”"
"“他没有这么说，”我说，“他从没说过，他不知道也不敢相信他的女儿还活在这世上。”","“He does not make it,” said I, “and has never made it, and has no knowledge or belief that his daughter is in existence.”"
"就这一次，他屡试不爽的手帕不起作用了。我的回答太出人意料了，贾格尔斯先生的手帕没有完成惯常的表演任务，他把手帕放回口袋，两条胳膊交叉在一起，神情严肃地注视着我，脸上却依然不动声色。","For once, the powerful pocket-handkerchief failed.My reply was so unexpected that Mr. Jaggers put the handkerchief back into his pocket without completing the usual performance, folded his arms, and looked with stern attention at me, though with an immovable face."
"然后我把我所知道的都跟他说了，还有我是怎么知道的也跟他说了，除了一点，有些事我其实是从温米克那里知道的，我也说成是郝维仙小姐告诉我的，让他去猜测好了。说这些事情的时候我都是十分小心谨慎的。直到我说完了所有要说的话，和贾格尔斯先生的眼光默默相对了一会儿之后，我才朝温米克的方向望去。我最终把眼光转向温米克的时候，发现他已经把那只笔从邮筒似的嘴上取下来了，正伏在他面前的那张桌上写着什么。","Then I told him all I knew, and how I knew it; with the one reservation that I left him to infer that I knew from Miss Havisham what I in fact knew from Wemmick.I was very careful indeed as to that.Nor, did I look towards Wemmick until I had finished all I had to tell, and had been for some time silently meeting Mr. Jaggers’ look.When I did at last turn my eyes in Wemmick’s direction, I found that he had unposted his pen, and was intent upon the table before him."
"“哈！”贾格尔斯先生朝桌上那一堆票据走去，说，“——温米克，皮普先生进来的时候，你的账目核对到哪一笔了？”","“Hah!” said Mr. Jaggers at last, as he moved towards the papers on the table, “—What item was it you were at, Wemmick, when Mr. Pip came in?”"
"我不甘心就这样被他们搁在一边，我情绪激动地、几乎是义愤填膺地要求贾格尔斯先生对我坦诚些、直率些。我提醒他我曾抱有怎样徒然的希望，它们在我心里珍藏了多久，现在发现了事情是怎么一回事：我暗示他我的灵魂经受了怎样的危险。我说我刚才对他说的话中毫无隐瞒，体现了我对他的信赖，我当然值得他对我表现出些许的信赖。我说我没有怪过他，也没有怀疑过他，也没有不信任过他，但我希望他能做出肯定的回答，肯定我所说的都是事实。如果他问我，为什么想从他那里得到肯定的回答，为什么认为自己有这个权利，我会告诉他，尽管他对我可怜的梦想不屑一顾，但我长期以来一直深爱着埃斯特拉，虽然我失去了她，我注定要一个人孤独地度过此生，但凡是跟她有关的事情，对我来说都是无比亲切的，比世界上其他任何事情都更亲切。贾格尔斯先生站在那里一动不动，默不作声，看来他对我这一请求无动于衷，我见状转向温米克，说：“温米克，我知道你是个慈悲心肠的人。我去过你舒适的家，拜访过你的老父亲，见识过你那天真、有趣的生活方式，那是你日常工作的调剂。我恳请你替我在贾格尔斯先生面前说几句，向他表明，在任何情况下，他都应该与我坦诚相待！”","But I could not submit to be thrown off in that way, and I made a passionate, almost an indignant, appeal to him to be more frank and manly with me.I reminded him of the false hopes into which I had lapsed, the length of time they had lasted, and the discovery I had made: and I hinted at the danger that weighed upon my spirits.I represented myself as being surely worthy of some little confidence from him, in return for the confidence I had just now imparted.I said that I did not blame him, or suspect him, or mistrust him, but I wanted assurance of the truth from him.And if he asked me why I wanted it and why I thought I had any right to it, I would tell him, little as he cared for such poor dreams, that I had loved Estella dearly and long, and that, although I had lost her and must live a bereaved life, whatever concerned her was still nearer and dearer to me than anything else in the world.And seeing that Mr. Jaggers stood quite still and silent, and apparently quite obdurate, under this appeal, I turned to Wemmick, and said, “Wemmick, I know you to be a man with a gentle heart.I have seen your pleasant home, and your old father, and all the innocent cheerful playful ways with which you refresh your business life.And I entreat you to say a word for me to Mr. Jaggers, and to represent to him that, all circumstances considered, he ought to be more open with me!”"
"听了我这一番恳求，贾格尔斯先生和温米克面面相觑，我从未见过比他们俩当时更怪异的表情。起初，我还担心温米克会马上被解雇，不过，当我看见贾格尔斯先生脸上似乎漾起了笑意，温米克也显得更加大胆了些，我的担心顿时烟消云散了。","I have never seen two men look more oddly at one another than Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick did after this apostrophe.At first, a misgiving crossed me that Wemmick would be instantly dismissed from his employment; but, it melted as I saw Mr. Jaggers relax into something like a smile, and Wemmick become bolder."
"“这是怎么一回事？”贾格尔斯先生说，“你和你的老父亲，还有你天真有趣的生活方式？”","“What’s all this?” said Mr. Jaggers.“You with an old father, and you with pleasant and playful ways?”"
"“这个嘛！”温米克回答说，“如果我不把它们带到这里来，那有什么关系呢？”","“Well!” returned Wemmick. “If I don’t bring ’em here, what does it matter?”"
"“皮普，”贾格尔斯先生一只手搁在我的手臂上，满脸堆笑地说，“这个人准是全伦敦城最狡猾的骗子了。”","“Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, laying his hand upon my arm, and smiling openly, “this man must be the most cunning impostor in all London.”"
"“根本就不是。”温米克胆子越来越大，反驳了起来，“我看您倒是。”","“Not a bit of it,” returned Wemmick, growing bolder and bolder.“I think you’re another.”"
"两人又交换了一次先前那种古怪的表情，各自都对对方心怀戒备，唯恐自己上当。","Again they exchanged their former odd looks, each apparently still distrustful that the other was taking him in."
"“你有一个舒适的家？”贾格尔斯先生说。","“You with a pleasant home?” said Mr. Jaggers."
"“既然这和事务所的事情无关，”温米克说，“那就不必提它。依我看，先生，如果有一天，您对每天满满的工作感到厌倦了，也计划着建设一个属于自己的舒适的家，我不会感到惊讶的。”","“Since it don’t interfere with business,” returned Wemmick, “let it be so.Now, I look at you, sir, I shouldn’t wonder if you might be planning and contriving to have a pleasant home of your own, one of these days, when you’re tired of all this work.”"
"贾格尔斯先生带着回忆往昔的神情，连连点了两三次头，还叹了一口气。“皮普，”他说，“我们不谈什么‘可怜的梦想’，这种事情你知道的比我多，有更多的亲身体验。不过现在，关于另外一件事。我要跟你打个比方。注意！我不是要承认什么。”","Mr. Jaggers nodded his head retrospectively two or three times, and actually drew a sigh.“Pip,” said he, “we won’t talk about ‘poor dreams;’ you know more about such things than I, having much fresher experience of that kind.But now, about this other matter.I’ll put a case to you.Mind!I admit nothing.”"
"他说完就等着我表态，表明我完全明白，他特别强调他不是要承认什么。","He waited for me to declare that I quite understood that he expressly said that he admitted nothing."
"“听着，皮普，”贾格尔斯先生说，“举这么一个例子。假如说有这么一个女人，处于你刚才所说的那种情形之下，把自己的孩子藏了起来，但她不得不把这个事实告诉她的法律顾问，因为法律顾问必须了解她如何处置这个孩子，才能为她展开辩护。假如说与此同时，这个法律顾问受一位古怪而富有的女人所托，她想领养一个孩子并把这孩子抚养成人，委托他替她物色这么一个孩子。”","“Now, Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, “put this case.Put the case that a woman, under such circumstances as you have mentioned, held her child concealed, and was obliged to communicate the fact to her legal adviser, on his representing to her that he must know, with an eye to the latitude of his defense, how the fact stood about that child.Put the case that at the same time he held a trust to find a child for an eccentric rich lady to adopt and bring up.”"
"“我明白您的意思，先生。”","“I follow you, sir.”"
"“假如这个法律顾问身处一个罪恶的环境当中，他看到孩子们一个一个地生出来，又一个一个地走向毁灭。假如他常常看到孩子们在刑事法庭上受到严厉的审讯；假如他知道他们会被关进监狱、受鞭打、被流放、遭驱逐，他们各种各样的罪行把他们一步步推向了绞刑官，长大后注定要被推上绞刑架。假如他每天的工作中都要接触很多这样的孩子，他有理由把他们看成许许多多的鱼卵，鱼卵长成鱼后，落入了他的渔网中——受到起诉、找律师辩护、被人遗弃、成为孤儿、不知不觉陷入了魔窟。”","“Put the case that he lived in an atmosphere of evil, and that all he saw of children, was, their being generated in great numbers for certain destruction.Put the case that he often saw children solemnly tried at a criminal bar, where they were held up to be seen; put the case that he habitually knew of their being imprisoned, whipped, transported, neglected, cast out, qualified in all ways for the hangman, and growing up to be hanged.Put the case that pretty nigh all the children he saw in his daily business life, he had reason to look upon as so much spawn, to develop into the fish that were to come to his net—to be prosecuted, defended, forsworn, made orphans, bedeviled somehow.”"
"“我明白您的意思，先生。”","“I follow you, sir.”"
"“假如说，皮普，在这样一个群体当中有一个可爱的孩子，是可以被挽救的。孩子的父亲以为她死了，又不敢做什么。至于孩子的母亲呢，她的法律顾问有权力控制她，他给她提出了建议：‘我知道你都做了什么，也知道你是怎么做的。我知道你是怎样攻击的，又是怎样防卫的，也知道你做了怎样的事情来躲避嫌疑。我对你所做的一切都调查清楚了，我一样一样地说给你听。你跟这孩子分开，除非为了洗刷你的罪名有必要让她出庭，那时再让她出现。把这个孩子交给我处置，我会尽最大努力帮你脱险。如果你得救了，你的孩子也没事；如果你出事了，你的孩子仍然没事。’假如说那个女人照法律顾问的话做了，并且最终她的罪名得以洗刷。”","“Put the case, Pip, that here was one pretty little child out of the heap, who could be saved; whom the father believed dead, and dared make no stir about; as to whom, over the mother, the legal adviser had this power: ‘I know what you did, and how you did it.You came so and so, this was your manner of attack and this the manner of resistance, you went so and so, you did such and such things to divert suspicion.I have tracked you through it all, and I tell it you all.Part with the child, unless it should be necessary to produce it to clear you, and then it shall be produced.Give the child into my hands, and I will do my best to bring you off.If you are saved, your child is saved too; if you are lost, your child is still saved.’Put the case that this was done, and that the woman was cleared.”"
"“我完全明白您的意思。”","“I understand you perfectly.”"
"“可我什么也没有承认，是吧？”","“But that I make no admissions?”"
"“您什么也没有承认。”温米克重复了一遍：“什么也没有承认。”","“That you make no admissions.”And Wemmick repeated, “No admissions.”"
"“假如说，皮普，情感上的打击和对死亡的恐惧让这个女人有些精神失常，她重获自由后，有如惊弓之鸟，与这个世界格格不入，于是投奔她的法律顾问，请求他收容她。假如他收容了她，每当察觉到她过去那种狂野的性子有发作的苗头时，就用老办法制服她，把她的性子压下去。你明白我的这个假设吗？”","“Put the case, Pip, that passion and the terror of death had a little shaken the woman’s intellect, and that when she was set at liberty, she was scared out of the ways of the world and went to him to be sheltered.Put the case that he took her in, and that he kept down the old wild violent nature whenever he saw an inkling of its breaking out, by asserting his power over her in the old way.Do you comprehend the imaginary case?”"
"“完全明白。”","“Quite.”"
"“假如这个孩子长大了，为了钱出嫁了。她的母亲还在这世上。她的父亲也还在这世上。她的父母亲都不知道彼此的存在，虽然他们住的地方只相隔几英里，或者说近在咫尺，随你怎么说都行。这个秘密仍然是个秘密，你得知的只是一些风声而已。我最后打的这个比方你可要好好想想。”","“Put the case that the child grew up, and was married for money.That the mother was still living.That the father was still living.That the mother and father unknown to one another, were dwelling within so many miles, furlongs, yards if you like, of one another.That the secret was still a secret, except that you had got wind of it.Put that last case to yourself very carefully.”"
"“我会的。”","“I do.”"
"“我也请温米克好好想想。”","“I ask Wemmick to put it to himself very carefully.”"
"温米克说：“我会的。”","And Wemmick said, “I do.”"
"“你要是把这个秘密泄露出去，是为谁好呢？为了那个做父亲的？我看他知道了她母亲的下落不见得会更好。为了那个做母亲的？我看她做出了这种事情，还是呆在原地不动最安全。为了那个做女儿的？我看让她丈夫知道她父母亲的身份，这对她没有好处，只会让她丢脸，虽然隐瞒了二十年，但保不了一生平安无事。不过，考虑到你曾经爱过她，皮普，并且她是你‘可怜的梦想’的女主角，其实她一度是多少人梦中的女主角，可能多得超乎你的想象。所以我跟你说，你最好——你一想通马上就会愿意的——用你那扎着绷带的右手砍掉你扎着绷带的左手，再把斧头交给温米克，让他把你扎着绷带的右手也砍下来。”","“For whose sake would you reveal the secret?For the father’s?I think he would not be much the better for the mother.For the mother’s?I think if she had done such a deed she would be safer where she was.For the daughter’s?I think it would hardly serve her, to establish her parentage for the information of her husband, and to drag her back to disgrace, after an escape of twenty years, pretty secure to last for life.But, add the case that you had loved her, Pip, and had made her the subject of those ‘poor dreams’ which have, at one time or another, been in the heads of more men than you think likely, then I tell you that you had better—and would much sooner when you had thought well of it—chop off that bandaged left hand of yours with your bandaged right hand, and then pass the chopper on to Wemmick there, to cut that off, too.”"
"我望了一眼温米克，他的表情十分严肃。他庄重地用食指碰了一下嘴唇。我也做了同样的动作。贾格尔斯先生也做了。“好了，温米克，”贾格尔斯先生恢复了常态，说，“皮普先生进来的时候，你核对到哪一笔账目了？”","I looked at Wemmick, whose face was very grave.He gravely touched his lips with his forefinger.I did the same.Mr. Jaggers did the same.“Now, Wemmick,” said the latter then, resuming his usual manner, “what item was it you were at, when Mr. Pip came in?”"
"他们工作的时候我在一旁看了一会儿，我发现他们之前对视的那种怪异神情又出现了好几次。这次的不同之处在于，两人都下意识地生怕向对方表现出自己哪怕一点点的薄弱之处和不专业的地方。我想，可能正因为如此，他们现在才互不相让；贾格尔斯先生十分专制，温米克则一意要为自己辩护，哪怕再小的事情也要停下来争论片刻。我从未见过他们相处得这么不融洽；因为他们通常都相处甚欢。","Standing by for a little, while they were at work, I observed that the odd looks they had cast at one another were repeated several times: with this difference now, that each of them seemed suspicious, not to say conscious, of having shown himself in a weak and unprofessional light to the other.For this reason, I suppose, they were now inflexible with one another; Mr. Jaggers being highly dictatorial, and Wemmick obstinately justifying himself whenever there was the smallest point in abeyance for a moment.I had never seen them on such ill terms; for generally they got on very well indeed together."
"不过，迈克的及时出现替他们解了围。迈克是我第一次来的时候见过的一个客户，他戴着一顶皮帽，总喜欢用衣袖擦鼻子。这个人，不管是他本人，还是他的家人，似乎老是惹麻烦（惹麻烦的意思是进了纽盖特监狱），他这次是来诉说他的大女儿因为行窃的嫌疑被投进了纽盖特监狱。他跟温米克说这件烦心事的时候，贾格尔斯先生威严地站在火炉旁，对他说的话毫不在意，迈克说着说着，眨了一眨眼，一滴眼泪滴了下来。","But, they were both happily relieved by the opportune appearance of Mike, the client with the fur cap and the habit of wiping his nose on his sleeve, whom I had seen on the very first day of my appearance within those walls.This individual, who, either in his own person or in that of some member of his family, seemed to be always in trouble (which in that place meant Newgate), called to announce that his eldest daughter was taken up on suspicion of shop-lifting.As he imparted this melancholy circumstance to Wemmick, Mr. Jaggers standing magisterially before the fire and taking no share in the proceedings, Mike’s eye happened to twinkle with a tear."
"“你来这里干嘛？”温米克非常愤怒地问道，“你来这里哭哭啼啼干嘛？”","“What are you about?” demanded Wemmick, with the utmost indignation. “What do you come sniveling here for?”"
"“我不是故意的，温米克先生。”","“I didn’t go to do it, Mr. Wemmick.”"
"“你就是故意的，”温米克说，“你怎敢说不是？如果你控制不住自己，一来这里就像一只漏水的笔一样哭哭啼啼的，就不要来。你哭哭啼啼的要干嘛？”","“You did,” said Wemmick.“How dare you?You’re not in a fit state to come here, if you can’t come here without spluttering like a bad pen.What do you mean by it?”"
"“一个人控制不了自己的感情，温米克先生。”迈克为自己辩护。","“A man can’t help his feelings, Mr. Wemmick,” pleaded Mike."
"“自己的什么？”温米克凶神恶煞地问道，“你再说一遍！”","“His what?” demanded Wemmick, quite savagely. “Say that again!”"
"“喂，你听着。”贾格尔斯先生向前走了一步，指着大门说，“你从事务所里出去。我们这里是不讲感情的。出去。”","“Now, look here my man,” said Mr. Jaggers, advancing a step, and pointing to the door.“Get out of this office.I’ll have no feelings here.Get out.”"
"“你这是自作自受，”温米克说，“出去。”","“It serves you right,” said Wemmick, “Get out.”"
"这个不幸的迈克于是唯唯诺诺地退了出去，贾格尔斯先生和温米克好像恢复了友好的关系，精神抖擞地继续工作，就好像刚刚美美地享用了一顿午餐。","So the unfortunate Mike very humbly withdrew, and Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick appeared to have re-established their good understanding, and went to work again with an air of refreshment upon them as if they had just had lunch."
"第五十二章","Chapter 52"
"我把那张支票揣在口袋里，离开了小不列颠街，径直去找司琪芬小姐的那位当会计的哥哥。这位会计又径直去了克拉利克公司，把克拉利克请到我这里来了。办妥这件事后我有了一种极大的满足感。自从我得知有一笔遗产要继承以来，这是我所做的唯一一件好事，也是唯一一件圆满完成了的事。","From Little Britain, I went, with my check in my pocket, to Miss Skiffins’ brother, the accountant; and Miss Skiffins’ brother, the accountant, going straight to Clarriker’s and bringing Clarriker to me, I had the great satisfaction of concluding that arrangement.It was the only good thing I had done, and the only completed thing I had done, since I was first apprised of my great expectations."
"克拉利克跟我说，公司的业务正在稳步发展当中，由于扩展业务的需要，他打算在东方开设一个小的分公司，赫伯特如今是合伙人了，可以派他过去主持业务，我意识到自己必须做好和朋友分别的准备了，尽管我自己的事情还没有做完。现在我感到我这条船最后的锚也松动了，不久，我就会被海上的风浪带走了。","Clarriker informing me on that occasion that the affairs of the House were steadily progressing, that he would now be able to establish a small branch-house in the East which was much wanted for the extension of the business, and that Herbert in his new partnership capacity would go out and take charge of it, I found that I must have prepared for a separation from my friend, even though my own affairs had been more settled.And now indeed I felt as if my last anchor was loosening its hold, and I should soon be driving with the winds and waves."
"不过，我的所作所为是有回报的，这种回报正在于赫伯特的欢欣鼓舞——他会在某个晚上，回家来高兴地告诉我这些变动，他应该想不到这对我来说已经不是新闻了。他会在脑海中描绘一幅蓝图，在这幅蓝图中，他会带着克拉拉·巴利去那个《天方夜谭》里的国度，我会去和他们会合（我想我会带着一队骆驼随行），我们沿着尼罗河一路向上，观赏两岸的奇异景观。在这些计划当中，对于我自己，我看不到成功的希望，不过我能感到赫伯特的前途是一片光明，至于那个比尔·巴利老头，只要他坚持成天吃胡椒配朗姆酒，那么他的女儿很快就要过上好日子了。","But, there was recompense in the joy with which Herbert would come home of a night and tell me of these changes, little imagining that he told me no news, and would sketch airy pictures of himself conducting Clara Barley to the land of the Arabian Nights, and of me going out to join them (with a caravan of camels, I believe), and of our all going up the Nile and seeing wonders.Without being sanguine as to my own part in these bright plans, I felt that Herbert’s way was clearing fast, and that old Bill Barley had but to stick to his pepper and rum, and his daughter would soon be happily provided for."
"很快就到了三月份。我的左臂虽然没有出现恶化的征兆，但等其自由恢复还需要很长的时间，我还是没有办法穿外套。我的右臂马马虎虎恢复了——虽然留下了伤疤，但还可以使唤。","We had now got into the month of March.My left arm, though it presented no bad symptoms, took in the natural course so long to heal that I was still unable to get a coat on.My right arm was tolerably restored;—disfigured, but fairly serviceable."
"一个星期一的早上，赫伯特和我正在吃早餐，我收到了一封温米克寄来的信，信上写道：","On a Monday morning, when Herbert and I were at breakfast, I received the following letter from Wemmick by the post."
"“沃尔沃斯。读完即刻烧毁。本星期前几天，如星期三，如感到可以一试，不妨实行你的计划。即刻烧毁。”","“Walworth.Burn this as soon as read.Early in the week, or say Wednesday, you might do what you know of, if you felt disposed to try it.Now burn.”"
"我把信给赫伯特看后，将信丢进了火炉里——但在此之前，我们对信上的内容都已牢记在心——我们接下来就要考虑该怎么做的问题。显然，我的两只胳膊因为受伤不能划船了，这是个不得不考虑的问题。","When I had shown this to Herbert and had put it in the fire—but not before we had both got it by heart—we considered what to do.For, of course my being disabled could now be no longer kept out of view."
"“我想过了，想了很多次，”赫伯特说，“我想我们用不着请一个泰晤士河上的船夫，我有一个更好的办法。我们可以叫斯塔特普来帮忙。他是个好哥们，是个划船的好手，对我们挺有好感，为人热情又诚实。”","“I have thought it over, again and again,” said Herbert, “and I think I know a better course than taking a Thames waterman.Take Startop.A good fellow, a skilled hand, fond of us, and enthusiastic and honorable.”"
"其实我也不止一次想到过他。","I had thought of him, more than once."
"“那你打算跟他透露多少呢，赫伯特？”","“But how much would you tell him, Herbert?”"
"“有必要跟他透露一些，但越少越好。让他以为我们这只是一时心血来潮。但我们的行动要秘密进行，直到那一天的早上——那时再告诉他你把普罗维斯带上船送出国去的紧急原因。你和他一起走吗？”","“It is necessary to tell him very little.Let him suppose it a mere freak, but a secret one, until the morning comes: then let him know that there is urgent reason for your getting Provis aboard and away.You go with him?”"
"“当然。”","“No doubt.”"
"“去哪里？”","“Where?”"
"我有很多让我焦虑的事情要考虑，所以对我来说，去哪个港口这个问题用不着考虑太多——汉堡、鹿特丹、安特卫普——去哪个地方都无所谓，只要他出了英国就好。要看我们遇上的是哪国的蒸汽船，不管去哪个国家，只要能带我们走就行。我一直在心里盘算着，要带他顺流而下，一定要划过格雷文森德，这是一处关键的地方，如果被怀疑，就要遭到搜查和盘问。外国蒸汽船一般在水位高的时候从伦敦开出。我们的计划是，在前一天退潮的时候沿河而下，停在某个僻静的地方，等到过来一艘外国轮船就上船。至于我们停船的地方什么时候会有外国轮船经过，不管我们停在什么地方，都可以事先做好调查，准确地计算出来。","It had seemed to me, in the many anxious considerations I had given the point, almost indifferent what port we made for—Hamburg, Rotterdam, Antwerp—the place signified little, so that he was got out of England.Any foreign steamer that fell in our way and would take us up, would do.I had always proposed to myself to get him well down the river in the boat; certainly well beyond Gravesend, which was a critical place for search or inquiry if suspicion were afoot.As foreign steamers would leave London at about the time of high-water, our plan would be to get down the river by a previous ebb-tide, and lie by in some quiet spot until we could pull off to one.The time when one would be due where we lay, wherever that might be, could be calculated pretty nearly, if we made inquiries beforehand."
"赫伯特对我的计划一概赞成。我们吃过早餐后就立刻出发，开始展开我们的调查。我们发现有一艘驶往汉堡的蒸汽船最符合我们的目的，我们就主要指望这条船了。不过我们也记下了其他将于同一时间离开的外国蒸汽船，我们还了解了每艘船的构造和颜色，这点让我们很满意。然后我们分开了几个钟头。我立刻去办理出国所必需的护照，赫伯特去斯塔特普的住所找他了。我们的事情都办得很顺利，下午一点钟我们碰头了，相互报告自己完成的事情。我已经把护照准备好了，赫伯特也见过了斯塔特普，他十分乐意加入我们的行动。","Herbert assented to all this, and we went out immediately after breakfast to pursue our investigations.We found that a steamer for Hamburg was likely to suit our purpose best, and we directed our thoughts chiefly to that vessel.But we noted down what other foreign steamers would leave London with the same tide, and we satisfied ourselves that we knew the build and color of each.We then separated for a few hours; I, to get at once such passports as were necessary; Herbert, to see Startop at his lodgings.We both did what we had to do without any hindrance, and when we met again at one o’clock reported it done.I, for my part, was prepared with passports; Herbert had seen Startop, and he was more than ready to join."
"我们商量好了，由他俩划桨，我掌舵。我们的被保护人安安静静地坐在舱里。划船速度不是要考虑的问题，我们慢慢划就行。我们商定好，赫伯特那晚先到米尔庞德岸去一趟，然后回来吃饭。而第二天，也就是星期二晚上，他就不再到那里去了，他得让普罗维斯做好准备，让他星期三一看见我们的小船驶来，就到住所附近的码头上去，但也别去得太早。这些安排星期一晚上就得跟普罗维斯说好，之后我们就不再跟他有任何方式的联系了，直到我们把他带上船。","Those two should pull a pair of oars, we settled, and I would steer; our charge would be sitter, and keep quiet; as speed was not our object, we should make way enough.We arranged that Herbert should not come home to dinner before going to Mill Pond Bank that evening; that he should not go there at all, to-morrow evening, Tuesday; that he should prepare Provis to come down to some Stairs hard by the house, on Wednesday, when he saw us approach, and not sooner; that all the arrangements with him should be concluded that Monday night; and that he should be communicated with no more in any way, until we took him on board."
"我们俩谈妥这些预防措施后，我才回家去。","These precautions well understood by both of us, I went home."
"我拿钥匙打开屋子外面的那扇门时，发现信箱里有一封信，是直接寄给我的。信弄得很脏，尽管语言还算通顺。信是派人送过来的（当然是在我出去的时候），信的内容如下：","On opening the outer door of our chambers with my key, I found a letter in the box, directed to me; a very dirty letter, though not ill-written.It had been delivered by hand (of course since I left home), and its contents were these:"
"“如果你有胆量的话，最好于今晚或明晚九点，到我们熟悉的那片沼泽地来，到石灰窑旁的小水闸室这边来。如果你想知道关于你伯父普罗维斯的情况，最好来一趟，不要告诉任何人，也不要耽搁。务必独自过来。来时携带此信。”","“If you are not afraid to come to the old marshes tonight or tomorrow night at Nine, and to come to the little sluice-house by the limekiln, you had better come.If you want information regarding your uncle Provis, you had much better come and tell no one and lose no time.You must come alone.Bring this with you.”"
"本来我的思想负担就够重的了，现在又收到这样一封奇怪的信。我该怎么办，我不知道。更糟糕的是，我必须赶快做出决定，要不然我就会错过下午开出的马车，我今晚要准时到的话，只能赶这一趟车。我不想明晚去，因为明晚离出逃的日子太近了。再说，信中提供的信息可能和这次出逃有很大的关系，虽然我不知道有什么关系。","I had had load enough upon my mind before the receipt of this strange letter.What to do now, I could not tell.And the worst was, that I must decide quickly, or I should miss the afternoon coach, which would take me down in time for tonight.Tomorrow night I could not think of going, for it would be too close upon the time of the flight.And again, for anything I knew, the proffered information might have some important bearing on the flight itself."
"就算我有充足的时间考虑，我想我还是会去的。我几乎没有时间考虑了——我看了看手表，马车半小时后就要出发了——我下定决心立刻出发。要不是信上提到了我的伯父普罗维斯，我是肯定不会去的。先是温米克的来信，然后是一上午的奔波，可现在收到这样一封信，我是非去不可了。","If I had had ample time for consideration, I believe I should still have gone.Having hardly any time for consideration—my watch showing me that the coach started within half an hour—I resolved to go.I should certainly not have gone, but for the reference to my Uncle Provis; that, coming on Wemmick’s letter and the morning’s busy preparation, turned the scale."
"在这样匆忙的情况下，要弄清任何一封信的内容都是非常困难的，我不得不一遍又一遍地读这封神秘的来信，直到把信中要我保密的指示机械地记到脑子里为止。我以同样机械的方式，用铅笔给赫伯特留下了一张字条，告诉他我马上就要走了，不知要离开多久，我决定抓紧时间去看望一下郝维仙小姐，看看她情况怎样，然后马上回来。由于时间有限，我只得匆匆披上大衣，锁好大门，走小路去驿站。如果我当时乘坐双轮出租马车走大路，我就赶不上马车了，幸亏走了小路，马车刚从院子里驶出，我就上了车。等我平静下来，才发现车里只有我一个乘客，车厢里堆着齐膝的干草，车子一路颠簸前进。","It is so difficult to become clearly possessed of the contents of almost any letter, in a violent hurry, that I had to read this mysterious epistle again, twice, before its injunction to me to be secret got mechanically into my mind.Yielding to it in the same mechanical kind of way, I left a note in pencil for Herbert, telling him that as I should be so soon going away, I knew not for how long, I had decided to hurry down and back, to ascertain for myself how Miss Havisham was faring.I had then barely time to get my great-coat, lock up the chambers, and make for the coach-office by the short by-ways.If I had taken a hackney-chariot and gone by the streets, I should have missed my aim; going as I did, I caught the coach just as it came out of the yard.I was the only inside passenger, jolting away knee-deep in straw, when I came to myself."
"自从收到这样一封信，我就神不守舍了。本来就已经忙了一个上午，看了这封信我更加迷惑了。我一上午都匆匆忙忙、紧张不安，因为我一直在焦急地等待温米克的来信，可他的信来了我却惊慌了起来。而现在，我开始感到疑惑了，我为什么要坐上马车，我此行是不是有充分的理由，我是不是该立刻下车转身往回走，我为什么要相信这样一封匿名信，总而言之，我思来想去、犹豫不决，我想大多数匆忙之人都是如此吧。不过，信上提到了普罗维斯，这就足以打消一切退缩的念头了。我思前想后，其实我早就忖度过了，不过自己没有意识到罢了——如果这算忖度的话——万一因为我不去，使得普罗维斯陷入危险的境地，我怎么能原谅我自己呢！","For, I really had not been myself since the receipt of the letter; it had so bewildered me ensuing on the hurry of the morning.The morning hurry and flutter had been great, for, long and anxiously as I had waited for Wemmick, his hint had come like a surprise at last.And now, I began to wonder at myself for being in the coach, and to doubt whether I had sufficient reason for being there, and to consider whether I should get out presently and go back, and to argue against ever heeding an anonymous communication, and, in short, to pass through all those phases of contradiction and indecision to which I suppose very few hurried people are strangers.Still, the reference to Provis by name, mastered everything.I reasoned as I had reasoned already without knowing it—if that be reasoning—in case any harm should befall him through my not going, how could I ever forgive myself!"
"等我们到了目的地，天色已经黑了，这趟旅行对我来说漫长而乏味，我坐在车厢里看不到外面的风景，我由于胳膊受伤行动不便，不能爬到车顶上去。我不想去“蓝野猪”饭店，于是进了镇上一家没什么名气的小旅馆，点了一份晚餐。趁着晚餐还没上来，我到沙提斯庄园去了一趟，询问了一下郝维仙小姐的病情。她病情还是很重，虽然比原先有了一些起色。","It was dark before we got down, and the journey seemed long and dreary to me who could see little of it inside, and who could not go outside in my disabled state.Avoiding the Blue Boar, I put up at an inn of minor reputation down the town, and ordered some dinner.While it was preparing, I went to Satis House and inquired for Miss Havisham; she was still very ill, though considered something better."
"我住的这家旅馆曾经是一座古老教堂的一部分，我用餐的这间八角形休息室看上去就像一个圣水盆。我因为没法使用刀叉，头顶秃得发亮的老店主便过来帮我。我们借机交谈起来，他十分友善，拿我自己的故事作为谈资——这是一个众所周知的传闻，说彭波契克是我最早的恩主和遗产的奠基人。","My inn had once been a part of an ancient ecclesiastical house, and I dined in a little octagonal common-room, like a font.As I was not able to cut my dinner, the old landlord with a shining bald head did it for me.This bringing us into conversation, he was so good as to entertain me with my own story—of course with the popular feature that Pumblechook was my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortunes."
"“你认识那个年轻人吗？”我说。","“Do you know the young man?” said I. "
"“认识！”店主重复道，“他还是个——小不点的时候就认识他了。”","“Know him!” repeated the landlord. “Ever since he was—no height at all.”"
"“他后来回过老家吗？”","“Does he ever come back to this neighborhood?”"
"“唉，他回过，”店主说，“他时不时回来看他的好朋友，不过对栽培他的人倒是很冷淡。”","“Ay, he comes back,” said the landlord, “to his great friends, now and again, and gives the cold shoulder to the man that made him.”"
"“那个栽培他的人是谁？”","“What man is that?”"
"“那个人我刚才说过了，”店主说，“就是彭波契克先生。”","“Him that I speak of,” said the landlord.“Mr. Pumblechook.”"
"“他没有对别的什么人忘恩负义吗？”","“Is he ungrateful to no one else?”"
"“如果可以的话，他毫无疑问会的。”店主说，“但他不可以。为什么？因为彭波契克一人一手栽培了他。”","“No doubt he would be, if he could,” returned the landlord, “but he can’t.And why?Because Pumblechook done everything for him.”"
"“彭波契克是这么说的？”","“Does Pumblechook say so?”"
"“这么说？”店主答道，“用不着他自己说。”","“Say so!” replied the landlord.“He han’t no call to say so.”"
"“他是这么说的吗？”","“But does he say so?”"
"“要是他会这么说的话，听见的人的血液都会变成白酒醋，先生。”店主说。","“It would turn a man’s blood to white wine winegar to hear him tell of it, sir,” said the landlord."
"我心里想着：“可是乔，亲爱的乔，你从来都没有跟人说过。受苦受难、慈悲心肠的乔，你从来没有抱怨过。还有你，好脾气的比迪！”","I thought, “Yet Joe, dear Joe, you never tell of it.Long-suffering and loving Joe, you never complain.Nor you, sweet-tempered Biddy!”"
"“看来你的意外伤影响了你的食欲。”店主瞥了一眼我罩在大衣下、绑着绷带的胳膊，说，“尝尝嫩一点的吧。”","“Your appetite’s been touched like, by your accident,” said the landlord, glancing at the bandaged arm under my coat.“Try a tenderer bit.”"
"“不了，谢谢。”我转过身去，对着炉火沉思起来，“我吃不下了。请收走吧。”","“No thank you,” I replied, turning from the table to brood over the fire.“I can eat no more.Please take it away.”"
"我从来没有受到这样深的触动，想到彭波契克这个骗子有多无耻，而我对乔有多不领情。他越虚伪，乔就越正直；他越卑鄙，乔就越高尚。","I had never been struck at so keenly, for my thanklessness to Joe, as through the brazen impostor Pumblechook.The falser he, the truer Joe; the meaner he, the nobler Joe."
"我对着炉火沉思了一个多小时，心情十分沉重，我觉得这一切都是我自作自受。这时，钟声响起，把我从沉思中唤醒了，可我仍然沮丧万分、懊悔不已，我站起身来，把大衣领子系在脖子上，出门去了。我起身之前就在口袋里摸了摸那封信，以便等一会儿拿出来再看看，可我摸不着，我想信一定是掉在马车上的干草堆里了，这个想法让我很不安。不过，我记得很清楚，约定的地点是沼泽地的石灰窑旁边的小水闸室，时间是九点整。已经没有时间耽搁了，我于是径直往沼泽地走去。","My heart was deeply and most deservedly humbled as I mused over the fire for an hour or more.The striking of the clock aroused me, but not from my dejection or remorse, and I got up and had my coat fastened round my neck, and went out.I had previously sought in my pockets for the letter, that I might refer to it again, but I could not find it, and was uneasy to think that it must have been dropped in the straw of the coach.I knew very well, however, that the appointed place was the little sluice-house by the limekiln on the marshes, and the hour nine.Towards the marshes I now went straight, having no time to spare."
"第五十三章","Chapter 53"
"这是一个漆黑的夜晚，尽管我离开围堤，进入沼泽地时，一轮满月正冉冉升起。黑漆漆的夜空的尽头是一条清澈的长带，窄得几乎容不下这轮红色的圆月。几分钟后，月亮从清澈的长带中跳出来了，随后又隐没在堆积如山的云层中了。","It was a dark night, though the full moon rose as I left the enclosed lands, and passed out upon the marshes.Beyond their dark line there was a ribbon of clear sky, hardly broad enough to hold the red large moon.In a few minutes she had ascended out of that clear field, in among the piled mountains of cloud."
"一阵哀怨的风吹来，沼泽地里一片凄凉。对于一个第一次到这里来的人，看到这景象估计会难以承受，即使是对我，这景象也让我十分压抑，我犹豫着想要打道回府了。不过，我对这一带很熟，即使天色比眼下黑得多，我也能找到路，既然已经来了，我就没有理由半途而返。所以，不情愿也已经走到了这里，我干脆继续往前走去。","There was a melancholy wind, and the marshes were very dismal.A stranger would have found them insupportable, and even to me they were so oppressive that I hesitated, half inclined to go back.But, I knew them well, and could have found my way on a far darker night, and had no excuse for returning, being there.So, having come there against my inclination, I went on against it."
"我选择的路既不会经过我以前住的老房子，也不是朝着当年我们追捕那两个逃犯的方向。我往前走着，背后远远的是一艘监狱船。我一扭头，还可以看见远处沙滩上老灯塔射出的灯光。我对石灰窑和古炮台都十分熟悉，不过它们相隔了好几英里，所以，如果晚上石灰窑和古炮台都有灯光射出的话，两个亮点之间就会出现一个狭长的黑色地带。","The direction that I took, was not that in which my old home lay, nor that in which we had pursued the convicts.My back was turned towards the distant Hulks as I walked on, and, though I could see the old lights away on the spits of sand, I saw them over my shoulder.I knew the limekiln as well as I knew the old Battery, but they were miles apart; so that if a light had been burning at each point that night, there would have been a long strip of the blank horizon between the two bright specks."
"起初，我在走过栅门之后还得把栅门关上，时不时地会碰上有牛躺在防护堤上。我只得站着不动，等它们起身踉踉跄跄地进了草丛和芦苇丛，然后再走。不过，过了一会儿，我面前似乎就都是低洼的沼泽地了。","At first, I had to shut some gates after me, and now and then to stand still while the cattle that were lying in the banked-up pathway, arose and blundered down among the grass and reeds.But after a little while, I seemed to have the whole flats to myself."
"我又花了半个小时才走到石灰窑附近。石灰还在烧着，散发出凝滞的、让人窒息的气味，火还在那里烧着，却一个工人也没看见。紧挨着石灰窑的是一个小型采石场。采石场就位于我前行的路上，白天有人在这里工作——我是从四处堆放着的工具和手推车看出来这一点的。","It was another half-hour before I drew near to the kiln.The lime was burning with a sluggish stifling smell, but the fires were made up and left, and no workmen were visible.Hard by, was a small stone-quarry.It lay directly in my way, and had been worked that day, as I saw by the tools and barrows that were lying about."
"我爬过采石场的坑才回到沼泽地面上——这条崎岖不平的路是必经之地——我看见破旧的水闸室里有灯亮着。我加快了步伐，伸手敲了敲门。我在等人开门时，看了看四周，我注意到这间水闸室已被毁弃，这间屋子——是木质结构的，砖瓦铺的顶棚——已经不能再经受风雨的打击了，其实它现在就已经经受不住了+B31，外面的泥浆地面上覆盖着一层石灰，窑里飘出一阵令人窒息的白烟，像鬼魂一样朝我爬过来。门里一直没有人应答，我又敲了敲门。还是没有人应答，我于是试着拔了拔门闩。","Coming up again to the marsh level out of this excavation—for the rude path lay through it—I saw a light in the old sluice-house.I quickened my pace, and knocked at the door with my hand.Waiting for some reply, I looked about me, noticing how the sluice was abandoned and broken, and how the house—of wood with a tiled roof—would not be proof against the weather much longer, if it were so even now, and how the mud and ooze were coated with lime, and how the choking vapor of the kiln crept in a ghostly way towards me.Still there was no answer, and I knocked again.No answer still, and I tried the latch."
"我刚一拔门闩，门就开了。我朝里张望了一下，看见一只点燃的蜡烛放在桌上，一张长凳，一张有脚轮的矮脚卧床，床上铺着一张床垫。上面还有一间阁楼，我喊了一句：“这里有人吗？”但没有人回答。我看了看手表，已经九点钟多了，我又喊了一句：“这里有人吗？”还是没有人回答，我走出门去，不知该如何是好。","It rose under my hand, and the door yielded.Looking in, I saw a lighted candle on a table, a bench, and a mattress on a truckle bedstead.As there was a loft above, I called, “Is there any one here?” but no voice answered. Then, I looked at my watch, and, finding that it was past nine, called again, “Is there any one here?”There being still no answer, I went out at the door, irresolute what to do."
"外面开始下起雨来。外面还是和刚才一样，我于是转身回到屋里，站在门道上躲雨，望着外面的黑夜。我想这里刚才一定有人来过，一定马上就会回来，要不然他不会让蜡烛一直燃烧着。我突然有了一个想法，回去看看蜡烛芯是不是足够长。我转身回去，刚把蜡烛拿在手上，突然有一股强大的力量把蜡烛熄灭了，等我意识过来，我已经被人用一个活结从头往下死死地套住了。","It was beginning to rain fast.Seeing nothing save what I had seen already, I turned back into the house, and stood just within the shelter of the doorway, looking out into the night.While I was considering that some one must have been there lately and must soon be coming back, or the candle would not be burning, it came into my head to look if the wick were long.I turned round to do so, and had taken up the candle in my hand, when it was extinguished by some violent shock, and the next thing I comprehended, was, that I had been caught in a strong running noose, thrown over my head from behind."
"“哈，”那个人压低了嗓子骂道，“我可抓住你了！”","“Now,” said a suppressed voice with an oath, “I’ve got you!”"
"“干什么？”我挣扎着喊了起来，“你是什么人？救命，救命，救命！”","“What is this?” I cried, struggling.“Who is it?Help, help, help!”"
"我的两只胳膊被紧紧地按住了不能动弹，关键是我那只受伤的胳膊被压住了，疼痛难忍。我的嘴一会儿被一只强有力的手顶住，一会儿被一个强壮的胸脯顶住，根本喊不出声来。我被困在墙边，在黑暗中做无谓的挣扎，总能感受到那个人呼出的热气。“好了，”那个低低的嗓音又骂了一句，“你要是再叫，我就要了你的命！”","Not only were my arms pulled close to my sides, but the pressure on my bad arm caused me exquisite pain.Sometimes, a strong man’s hand, sometimes a strong man’s breast, was set against my mouth to deaden my cries, and with a hot breath always close to me, I struggled ineffectually in the dark, while I was fastened tight to the wall.“And now,” said the suppressed voice with another oath, “call out again, and I’ll make short work of you!”"
"我那只受伤的胳膊让我痛得头昏、恶心，现在又受到这样莫名其妙的惊吓，但我知道这可能不只是恐吓而已，他很可能是来真的，我便不再喊叫了，我试着松了松胳膊，哪怕能松一点点也好。可是，胳膊绑得太紧，根本没有松动的可能。我觉得这条胳膊之前是被火烧，现在就好像是在水里煮一样。","Faint and sick with the pain of my injured arm, bewildered by the surprise, and yet conscious how easily this threat could be put in execution, I desisted, and tried to ease my arm were it ever so little.But, it was bound too tight for that.I felt as if, having been burnt before, it were now being boiled."
"窗外的夜色突然不见了，屋里一片黑暗，我这才意识到，这个人关上了百叶窗。他四处搜寻了一会儿，找到了一块打火石，还有一些钢块，开始打起火来。打出的火星掉到了火绒上，他对着手里的火柴不停地吹气。我睁大眼睛想看清楚一些，但只看得见他的嘴，还有火柴头上的蓝色火苗，能看见的只有这些，还随着火光时隐时现的。火绒受了潮——这并不奇怪——打出了一个又一个火花，但都熄灭了。","The sudden exclusion of the night and the substitution of black darkness in its place, warned me that the man had closed a shutter.After groping about for a little, he found the flint and steel he wanted, and began to strike a light.I strained my sight upon the sparks that fell among the tinder, and upon which he breathed and breathed, match in hand, but I could only see his lips, and the blue point of the match; even those, but fitfully.The tinder was damp—no wonder there—and one after another the sparks died out."
"这个人不慌也不忙，一次又一次地敲着打火石和钢块。他身旁掉下的火花越来越多，也越来越亮。我可以看见他的手，还有他脸部的轮廓，可以看出他正俯身面朝桌子坐着，能看到的就这些了。不一会儿我又看见了他青紫色的嘴唇，朝火绒吹着气，随即冒出一阵火光。这下我看清楚了，原来这个人是奥立克。","The man was in no hurry, and struck again with the flint and steel.As the sparks fell thick and bright about him, I could see his hands, and touches of his face, and could make out that he was seated and bending over the table; but nothing more.Presently I saw his blue lips again, breathing on the tinder, and then a flare of light flashed up, and showed me Orlick."
"我要见的人是谁，我不知道。但我要见的人不会是他。我一看是他，便意识到自己的处境很危险，我目不转睛地望着他。","Whom I had looked for, I don’t know.I had not looked for him.Seeing him, I felt that I was in a dangerous strait indeed, and I kept my eyes upon him."
"他用点着了的火柴点亮了蜡烛，动作十分小心谨慎，然后扔掉火柴，用脚踩熄了火花。然后他把蜡烛从身边移开，放到桌子上，这样可以把我看清楚。他就坐在那里，两只胳膊交叉着靠在桌上，两眼看着我。我发现自己被绑在一条垂直的梯子上，梯子离墙几英尺远——梯子是固定在那里的——一直通到上面的阁楼。","He lighted the candle from the flaring match with great deliberation, and dropped the match, and trod it out.Then, he put the candle away from him on the table, so that he could see me, and sat with his arms folded on the table and looked at me.I made out that I was fastened to a stout perpendicular ladder a few inches from the wall—a fixture there—the means of ascent to the loft above."
"“哈，”我们相互注视着对方，一会儿过后，他说话了，“我抓住你了。”","“Now,” said he, when we had surveyed one another for some time, “I’ve got you.”"
"“给我解开。放我走！”","“Unbind me.Let me go!”"
"“啊！”他说，“我会放你走的。我会放你到月亮上去，放你到星星上去。我要挑个良辰吉日。”","“Ah!” he returned, “I’ll let you go.I’ll let you go to the moon, I’ll let you go to the stars.All in good time.”"
"“你为什么要把我骗到这里来？”","“Why have you lured me here?”"
"“你不知道？”他满脸仇恨地说。","“Don’t you know?” said he, with a deadly look."
"“你为什么要弄得黑灯瞎火的来暗算我？”","“Why have you set upon me in the dark?”"
"“因为我想自己一个人干。一个人总比两个人能守住秘密。哼，你这个冤家，你这个冤家！”","“Because I mean to do it all myself.One keeps a secret better than two.Oh you enemy, you enemy!”"
"他坐着那里，两只胳膊交叉着靠在桌上，对着我摇头晃脑，得意洋洋地欣赏着我这副惨状，他那凶狠的样子让我浑身颤抖。我默不作声地看着他，他伸手从身旁的角落里摸出一支枪，枪托上包了一层铜皮。","His enjoyment of the spectacle I furnished, as he sat with his arms folded on the table, shaking his head at me and hugging himself, had a malignity in it that made me tremble.As I watched him in silence, he put his hand into the corner at his side, and took up a gun with a brass-bound stock."
"“你认识这个吗？”他边说边做出好像要瞄准我的姿势，“还记得你以前在哪里见过这玩意吗？快说，你这只狼！”","“Do you know this?” said he, making as if he would take aim at me. “Do you know where you saw it afore?Speak, wolf!”"
"“记得。”我说。","“Yes,” I answered."
"“你把我的饭碗给砸了。是你干的。你说！”","“You cost me that place.You did.Speak!”"
"“我还做了什么？”","“What else could I do?”"
"“是你干的，光这一件坏事就足够了。你哪来这么大的胆子，敢坏了我跟我喜欢的姑娘的好事？”","“You did that, and that would be enough, without more.How dared you to come betwixt me and a young woman I liked?”"
"“我什么时候干了这样的事？”","“When did I?”"
"“你怎么没干？就是你总在她面前说我的坏话，坏了我老奥立克的名声。”","“When didn’t you?It was you as always give Old Orlick a bad name to her.”"
"“是你自己坏了自己的名声，你这是自食其果。你如果不是自己坏了自己的名声，我又怎么能坏了你的名声呢。”","“You gave it to yourself; you gained it for yourself.I could have done you no harm, if you had done yourself none.”"
"“你说谎。你不管费多大力气，不管花多少钱，也要把我从村子里赶出去，是不是？”他重复了我跟比迪最后一次见面时说的话。“听着，我要给你透露一个消息。你要赶我走就趁今晚吧，没有比这更合适的时间了。啊！就算花上你所有家当二十倍那么多的钱，也是值得的！”他朝我挥了挥粗大的手，嘴里像老虎一样咆哮着，我觉得他是来真的了。","“You’re a liar.And you’ll take any pains, and spend any money, to drive me out of this country, will you?” said he, repeating my words to Biddy in the last interview I had with her.“Now, I’ll tell you a piece of information.It was never so well worth your while to get me out of this country as it is to-night.Ah!If it was all your money twenty times told, to the last brass farden!”As he shook his heavy hand at me, with his mouth snarling like a tiger’s, I felt that it was true."
"“你想把我怎么样？”","“What are you going to do to me?”"
"“我想，”他一拳头重重地打在桌上，拳头落下的同时他站起身来，这下这一拳可更加有力了，“我想要你的命！”","“I’m a-going,” said he, bringing his fist down upon the table with a heavy blow, and rising as the blow fell, to give it greater force, “I’m a-going to have your life!”"
"他倾着身子盯着我，慢慢松开了拳头，用手抹了抹嘴，好像因为可以干掉我而流下了口水，然后又坐下了。","He leaned forward staring at me, slowly unclenched his hand and drew it across his mouth as if his mouth watered for me, and sat down again."
"“你从小就老是坏我老奥立克的好事。从今天晚上起，你就再也没办法得逞了。老奥立克也不会再找你的麻烦了。因为你就要没命了。”","“You was always in Old Orlick’s way since ever you was a child.You goes out of his way, this present night.He’ll have no more on you.You’re dead.”"
"我觉得自己已经快要踏进坟墓了。我四处张望了一下，看有没有可能逃脱，可是什么发现任何逃脱的可能性。","I felt that I had come to the brink of my grave.For a moment I looked wildly round my trap for any chance of escape; but there was none."
"“还有，”他又把胳膊交叉着靠在桌上，“我不会让你留下哪怕一块布、一根骨头在这世上的。我要把你的尸体扔进石灰窑里——你这样的人，我一次就可以扛两个——随大家猜你怎么着了吧，他们什么也不会知道的。”","“More than that,” said he, folding his arms on the table again, “I won’t have a rag of you, I won’t have a bone of you, left on earth.I’ll put your body in the kiln—I’d carry two such to it, on my shoulders—and, let people suppose what they may of you, they shall never know nothing.”"
"这时，我的大脑转得飞快，我想着如果我就这样死了，会有什么样的后果。埃斯特拉的父亲会以为我抛弃了他，他会被逮捕，死后也要怪我的；赫伯特也会心生怀疑，我留给他的字条上明明写着：我去看望郝维仙小姐了，一会儿就回来；乔和比迪永远不会知道我那晚有多内疚；没人知道我内心承受了怎样的煎熬，没人知道我有多真诚，没人知道我经受了多大的痛苦。死期临近固然可怕，但比死亡更可怕的是死后被人误解。我思绪飞转，我仿佛看见自己被后世一代一代的人鄙视——埃斯特拉的孩子，她的孩子的孩子——正在这时，那个恶人又开始说话了。","My mind, with inconceivable rapidity, followed out all the consequences of such a death.Estella’s father would believe I had deserted him, would be taken, would die accusing me; even Herbert would doubt me, when he compared the letter I had left for him, with the fact that I had called at Miss Havisham’s gate for only a moment; Joe and Biddy would never know how sorry I had been that night; none would ever know what I had suffered, how true I had meant to be, what an agony I had passed through.The death close before me was terrible, but far more terrible than death was the dread of being misremembered after death.And so quick were my thoughts, that I saw myself despised by unborn generations—Estella’s children, and their children—while the wretch’s words were yet on his lips."
"“你这条狼，”他说，“我要把你干掉，就像干掉一个禽兽一样，不过在这之前——这正是我的目的，也是我把你绑起来的目的——我要好好看看你，好好气气你。哈，你这个冤家！”","“Now, wolf,” said he, “afore I kill you like any other beast—which is wot I mean to do and wot I have tied you up for—I’ll have a good look at you and a good goad at you.Oh, you enemy!”"
"我脑海中闪过一个念头，我要试着再呼救一次，虽然我比谁都清楚，在这个荒郊野岭，求救是几乎不可能的。他坐在那里幸灾乐祸地看着我，我只觉得对他深恶痛绝，干脆紧闭双唇，一言不发。最重要的是，我决定不求他，我宁可不要这条小命，哪怕胜算再小，也要跟他抗争到底。在那样无望的情形下，想到其他任何人我都会心软。我只能恭恭敬敬地祈求上天的怜悯了。想到我还没有跟善待我的人告别，也没有机会跟他们告别了，也没有办法跟他们表明心迹，请求他们原谅我犯下的卑劣的错误，我的心便一阵酸楚。不过，如果我能杀了他，就算只剩下最后一口气，我也要把他干掉。","It had passed through my thoughts to cry out for help again; though few could know better than I, the solitary nature of the spot, and the hopelessness of aid.But as he sat gloating over me, I was supported by a scornful detestation of him that sealed my lips.Above all things, I resolved that I would not entreat him, and that I would die making some last poor resistance to him.Softened as my thoughts of all the rest of men were in that dire extremity; humbly beseeching pardon, as I did, of Heaven; melted at heart, as I was, by the thought that I had taken no farewell, and never never now could take farewell, of those who were dear to me, or could explain myself to them, or ask for their compassion on my miserable errors; still, if I could have killed him, even in dying, I would have done it."
"他一直在喝酒，两眼通红，眼里布满了血丝。他脖子上挂着一个锡壶，这是他的老习惯，我过去就常常见他脖子上挂着肉啊酒啊的。他举起锡壶放到嘴边，猛地喝了一口。我闻到一股很浓烈的酒精味，他的脸上泛起了一阵潮红。","He had been drinking, and his eyes were red and bloodshot.Around his neck was slung a tin bottle, as I had often seen his meat and drink slung about him in other days.He brought the bottle to his lips, and took a fiery drink from it; and I smelt the strong spirits that I saw flash into his face."
"“你这条狼！”他又叉起了胳膊，说，“老奥立克要告诉你一件事情。是你害死了你那个泼妇姐姐。”","“Wolf!” said he, folding his arms again, “Old Orlick’s a-going to tell you somethink.It was you as did for your shrew sister.”"
"我脑子里又一次翻江倒海，他吞吞吐吐、结结巴巴的话还没说完，我眼前已经出现了姐姐被打、重病、去世的一幕幕。","Again my mind, with its former inconceivable rapidity, had exhausted the whole subject of the attack upon my sister, her illness, and her death, before his slow and hesitating speech had formed these words."
"“是你干的，你这个恶棍。”我说。","“It was you, villain,” said I."
"“我告诉你是你干的——我告诉你都是你干的。”他一边反驳一边抓起枪，在我们俩中间的空地上猛敲了一下，“我从后面靠近她，就像我今晚靠近你一样。我给了她一棒子！我让她自生自灭，要是当时她附近有个石灰窑，就像你现在一样，她后来是不会醒过来的。可这不是老奥立克干的，是你干的。你受宠，他被人欺侮、被人打。老奥立克被人欺侮、被人打，嗯？现在是你赔偿我的时候了。是你干的，现在是你赔偿我的时候了。”","“I tell you it was your doing—I tell you it was done through you,” he retorted, catching up the gun, and making a blow with the stock at the vacant air between us.“I come upon her from behind, as I come upon you tonight.I giv’ it her!I left her for dead, and if there had been a limekiln as nigh her as there is now nigh you, she shouldn’t have come to life again.But it warn’t Old Orlick as did it; it was you.You was favored, and he was bullied and beat.Old Orlick bullied and beat, eh?Now you pays for it.You done it; now you pays for it.”"
"他又喝起酒来，样子也越来越凶恶。我看见他的酒瓶倾斜得越来越厉害，就知道里面的酒已经所剩不多了。我非常清楚，他这是借酒壮胆，想取了我的性命。我知道里面装的每一滴酒，都是我的每一滴鲜血。我知道我就要化为一股白烟，和刚才朝我飘来的白烟融为一体，就像我自己的鬼魂一般，事后他会像对付完了我姐姐那样——匆匆跑到镇上，让人看见他正懒懒散散地到处闲荡，再到酒店里去喝酒。我的思绪立刻追随他到了镇上，脑子里构想出了一幅街景，他就在其中，街上灯火通明、生机勃勃，跟这片荒无人烟的沼泽地和徐徐蔓延的白烟形成对比，而我自己也融化在这片白茫茫的烟雾里了。","He drank again, and became more ferocious.I saw by his tilting of the bottle that there was no great quantity left in it.I distinctly understood that he was working himself up with its contents, to make an end of me.I knew that every drop it held, was a drop of my life.I knew that when I was changed into a part of the vapor that had crept towards me but a little while before, like my own warning ghost, he would do as he had done in my sister’s case—make all haste to the town, and be seen slouching about there, drinking at the ale-houses.My rapid mind pursued him to the town, made a picture of the street with him in it, and contrasted its lights and life with the lonely marsh and the white vapor creeping over it, into which I should have dissolved."
"他只说了几句，却唤起了我很多年前的记忆，从他嘴里吐出的不仅仅是话语，而是一幅幅的图画，展现在了我的面前。我的大脑处于一种高度亢奋的状态，以至于一说到某个地方，我便看到了那里的景象，一提到某些人，我便看到了他们的样子。这些画面在我面前有多生动，再怎么形容都不夸张，不过我一直把注意力集中在他身上——面对一只随时可能向你扑来的老虎，谁敢不留神呢！——他每个手指头的细微动作我都看在眼里。","It was not only that I could have summed up years and years and years while he said a dozen words, but that what he did say presented pictures to me, and not mere words.In the excited and exalted state of my brain, I could not think of a place without seeing it, or of persons without seeing them.It is impossible to over-state the vividness of these images, and yet I was so intent, all the time, upon him himself—who would not be intent on the tiger crouching to spring!—that I knew of the slightest action of his fingers."
"他第二次喝了酒后，从长凳上站起身来，把桌子推到一边。然后，他拿起蜡烛，用那只蓄意谋杀的手遮住了一些光，好让烛光照在我身上，他站到我面前，津津有味地端详着我。","When he had drunk this second time, he rose from the bench on which he sat, and pushed the table aside.Then, he took up the candle, and shading it with his murderous hand so as to throw its light on me, stood before me, looking at me and enjoying the sight."
"“你这只狼，我还要告诉你一件事。那天晚上在楼梯口绊了你一跤的正是我老奥立克。”","“Wolf, I’ll tell you something more.It was Old Orlick as you tumbled over on your stairs that night.”"
"我看见了楼梯口那些熄灭了的灯。我看见了厚重的楼梯栏杆在守夜人挂在墙上的灯笼的光照中投下的影子。我看见了那些以后再也看不到的房间，这里是一扇半开的门，那里是一扇关着的门，里面的家具也一一呈现在眼前。","I saw the staircase with its extinguished lamps.I saw the shadows of the heavy stair-rails, thrown by the watchman’s lantern on the wall.I saw the rooms that I was never to see again; here, a door half open; there, a door closed; all the articles of furniture around."
"“为什么老奥立克会在那里？我再告诉你一件事情吧，你这只狼。你和你姐姐成功地把我赶出了村子，你们可以过上舒坦日子了，而我也交了新朋友，认了新主子。我要他们帮我写信的时候，他就会帮我写——你介意吗？——帮我写信，你这只狼！他会写五十种不同的字体，不像你这个没用的家伙，只会写一种字体。自从那天看见你在你姐姐的葬礼上出现，我就铁了心，无论如何也要你的命。我想不出办法来干掉你，所以就跟踪你，时时留意你的行踪。因为，老奥立克对自己说，‘不管怎样，我都要把他干掉！’你猜怎么着！我追查你下落的时候居然碰到了你伯父普罗维斯，嗯？”","“And why was Old Orlick there?I’ll tell you something more, wolf.You and her have pretty well hunted me out of this country, so far as getting a easy living in it goes, and I’ve took up with new companions, and new masters.Some of ’em writes my letters when I wants ’em wrote—do you mind?—writes my letters, wolf!They writes fifty hands; they’re not like sneaking you, as writes but one.I’ve had a firm mind and a firm will to have your life, since you was down here at your sister’s burying.I havn’t seen a way to get you safe, and I’ve looked after you to know your ins and outs.For, says Old Orlick to himself, ‘Somehow or another I’ll have him!’What!When I looks for you, I finds your uncle Provis, eh?”"
"米尔庞德岸、叮当湾、老青铜绳索道，这些地方都清清楚楚地浮现在我眼前！呆在屋里的普罗维斯、我们使用的信号、美丽的克拉拉、慈母般的妇人、躺在床上的老比尔·巴利，这些人和物都在我眼前一闪而过，仿佛投入了我生命的急流，飞速流去，直奔大海。","Mill Pond Bank, and Chinks’ Basin, and the Old Green Copper Rope-Walk, all so clear and plain!Provis in his rooms, the signal whose use was over, pretty Clara, the good motherly woman, old Bill Barley on his back, all drifting by, as on the swift stream of my life fast running out to sea!"
"“你还有个伯父！哎呀，你还是个小狼崽子的时候，我就该用大拇指和食指这么一掐，把你给掐死（星期天的时候，我看见你在修剪过的树林里闲逛，我就想下手的），那个时候你哪里来的什么伯父呀。没有，你根本没有！老奥立克听说你的伯父普罗维斯最喜欢戴脚镣了，老奥立克很多年前在这片沼泽地上捡到过一副锉开的脚镣，他就是用这副脚镣打了你姐姐，像一头公牛一样，现在他想要用这副脚镣来对付你了——嘿？——当他听说那件事的时候——嘿？——”","“You with a uncle too!Why, I know’d you at Gargery’s when you was so small a wolf that I could have took your weazen betwixt this finger and thumb and chucked you away dead (as I’d thoughts o’ doing, odd times, when I see you loitering amongst the pollards on a Sunday), and you hadn’t found no uncles then.No, not you!But when Old Orlick come for to hear that your uncle Provis had mostlike wore the leg-iron wot Old Orlick had picked up, filed asunder, on these meshes ever so many year ago, and wot he kep by him till he dropped your sister with it, like a bullock, as he means to drop you—hey?—when he come for to hear that—hey?—”"
"他一边蛮横地嘲弄我，一边举起蜡烛，在我面前晃了晃，我转过脸去，以免被火焰烫着。","In his savage taunting, he flared the candle so close at me, that I turned my face aside, to save it from the flame."
"“啊！”他大叫了一声，又举起蜡烛在我面前晃了晃，又大笑了起来，“一朝被火烧，十年怕火苗！老奥立克知道你被烧伤了，老奥立克知道你打算把你的伯父偷渡出国，老奥立克跟你有一拼，他知道你今晚会来的！让我再告诉你一件事情吧，你这只狼，告诉你这最后一件事情。你有老奥立克这个对手，你伯父普罗维斯也有一个强有力的对手呢。到时候他没了你这个侄子，让他留神他的对手吧！到时候他亲爱的侄子身上一块布、一根骨头都找不到了，让他留神他的对手吧。那个人可不答应让马格维奇——是的，我知道这个名字！——跟他活在同一个国家。当马格维奇还在另一个国家的时候，他就打探到他的确切消息了，他不会回来了还不被那个人知道，他也不可能找那个人的麻烦。那个人会写五十种字体，不像你这个没用的家伙，只会写一种字体。马格维奇啊，留神康培生，留神绞刑架！”","“Ah!” he cried, laughing, after doing it again, “the burnt child dreads the fire!Old Orlick knowed you was burnt, Old Orlick knowed you was smuggling your uncle Provis away, Old Orlick’s a match for you and know’d you’d come tonight!Now I’ll tell you something more, wolf, and this ends it.There’s them that’s as good a match for your uncle Provis as Old Orlick has been for you.Let him ’ware them, when he’s lost his nevvy!Let him ’ware them, when no man can’t find a rag of his dear relation’s clothes, nor yet a bone of his body.There’s them that can’t and that won’t have Magwitch—yes, I know the name!—alive in the same land with them, and that’s had such sure information of him when he was alive in another land, as that he couldn’t and shouldn’t leave it unbeknown and put them in danger.P’raps it’s them that writes fifty hands, and that’s not like sneaking you as writes but one.’Ware Compeyson, Magwitch, and the gallows!”"
"他又一次拿起蜡烛在我面前晃动了起来，蜡烛的烟熏着我的脸和头发，让我一时睁不开眼，然后他转过他那雄壮的背，把蜡烛放到桌上。在他再次转过身来之前，我为乔、比迪和赫伯特作了一次祷告。","He flared the candle at me again, smoking my face and hair, and for an instant blinding me, and turned his powerful back as he replaced the light on the table.I had thought a prayer, and had been with Joe and Biddy and Herbert, before he turned towards me again."
"在桌子和对面的墙壁之间有一块几英尺见方的空地。在这块空地上，他懒洋洋地来来回回、走来走去。他两手松松地垂在身旁，手上积攒了足够的力气，两眼怒视着我，看起来好像比之前更有力气了。我连一线生机都没有了。我心里急切万分，脑子里已经没有了想法，眼前闪过一幅幅的画面。尽管如此，我心里还是很清楚，他知道过不了多久，我的小命就要没了，而且无人知晓，所以才把实情都告诉了我。","There was a clear space of a few feet between the table and the opposite wall.Within this space, he now slouched backwards and forwards.His great strength seemed to sit stronger upon him than ever before, as he did this with his hands hanging loose and heavy at his sides, and with his eyes scowling at me.I had no grain of hope left.Wild as my inward hurry was, and wonderful the force of the pictures that rushed by me instead of thoughts, I could yet clearly understand that unless he had resolved that I was within a few moments of surely perishing out of all human knowledge, he would never have told me what he had told."
"突然，他停住脚步，拔出瓶塞，随手把塞子扔掉了。瓶塞落地发出很轻的声响，在我听来却像铅垂一样。他举起酒杯不慌不忙地喝了起来，酒杯一点一点地倾斜，遮住了他看我的视线。他把最后几滴酒滴在掌心上，用舌头舔干净了。突然，只见他一阵狂怒，狠狠骂了几句，扔掉了瓶子，蹲下身来。接着，我看见他手上握着一把石槌，槌柄又长又重。","Of a sudden, he stopped, took the cork out of his bottle, and tossed it away.Light as it was, I heard it fall like a plummet.He swallowed slowly, tilting up the bottle by little and little, and now he looked at me no more.The last few drops of liquor he poured into the palm of his hand, and licked up.Then, with a sudden hurry of violence and swearing horribly, he threw the bottle from him, and stooped; and I saw in his hand a stone-hammer with a long heavy handle."
"我的决心不会改变，我没有向他求饶，而是用尽全身力气叫喊挣扎，要跟他抗争到底。我只有头和腿可以动，尽管如此，我还是用尽了全身力气拼命挣扎，当时连我自己都没意识到，我竟然能使出这么大的力气。与此同时，我听见外面有人在叫喊，看见有人影在动，一束光从门外射进来，接着听见嘈杂的叫嚷声、吵闹声，看见奥立克从一群人中挣扎着逃了出去，好像翻滚的洪水一般，一跃跳过桌子，冲了出去，消失在夜色里。","The resolution I had made did not desert me, for, without uttering one vain word of appeal to him, I shouted out with all my might, and struggled with all my might.It was only my head and my legs that I could move, but to that extent I struggled with all the force, until then unknown, that was within me.In the same instant I heard responsive shouts, saw figures and a gleam of light dash in at the door, heard voices and tumult, and saw Orlick emerge from a struggle of men, as if it were tumbling water, clear the table at a leap, and fly out into the night."
"我只觉得大脑一片空白，醒来以后，发现自己倒在地上，就在刚才昏倒的地方，身上的绳子已经解开了，头枕在一个人的膝盖上。我苏醒过来的时候，眼睛正盯着靠墙的梯子——我眼睛一睁开就望着它了，只是那时神志还没有清醒过来——我恢复了知觉，知道自己就躺在刚才晕过去的地方。","After a blank, I found that I was lying unbound, on the floor, in the same place, with my head on some one’s knee.My eyes were fixed on the ladder against the wall, when I came to myself—had opened on it before my mind saw it—and thus as I recovered consciousness, I knew that I was in the place where I had lost it."
"起初我还没回过神来，甚至没想过转过头看看是谁在扶着我。我躺在那里盯着梯子，这时视线中出现了一张脸。是特拉布裁缝店的伙计！","Too indifferent at first, even to look round and ascertain who supported me, I was lying looking at the ladder, when there came between me and it, a face.The face of Trabb’s boy!"
"“我想他没事了！”特拉布裁缝店的伙计语气冷静地说，“不过脸色还是有些苍白！”","“I think he’s all right!” said Trabb’s boy, in a sober voice; “but ain’t he just pale though!”"
"听了这话，扶着我的那个人低头看了看我，这时我才发现扶着我的人正是——","At these words, the face of him who supported me looked over into mine, and I saw my supporter to be—"
"“赫伯特！天啊！”","“Herbert!Great Heaven!”"
"“轻点，”赫伯特说，“轻点，汉德尔。别太激动。”","“Softly,” said Herbert.“Gently, Handel.Don’t be too eager.”"
"“还有我们的老朋友，斯塔特普！”斯塔特普这时也弯下身子看着我，我不禁喊了起来。","“And our old comrade, Startop!” I cried, as he too bent over me."
"“还记得他要帮我们什么忙吗，”赫伯特说，“镇定些。”","“Remember what he is going to assist us in,” said Herbert, “and be calm.”"
"经他这么一提，我从地上跳了起来，但胳膊的疼痛让我又一屁股跌坐在地上。“我没有耽误时间吧，赫伯特，有吗？今晚星期几了？我在这里躺了多久了？”我有一种奇怪而强烈的担心，担心我在这里躺了很长的时间——一天一夜——两天两夜——甚至更久。","The allusion made me spring up; though I dropped again from the pain in my arm.“The time has not gone by, Herbert, has it?What night is tonight?How long have I been here?”For, I had a strange and strong misgiving that I had been lying there a long time—a day and a night—two days and nights—more."
"“没有误时。现在还是星期一晚上。”","“The time has not gone by.It is still Monday night.”"
"“谢谢老天！”","“Thank God!”"
"“明天星期二，你还有一整天可以休息。”赫伯特说，“可是你一直在呻吟，我亲爱的汉德尔。你哪里受伤了？你可以站起来吗？”","“And you have all tomorrow, Tuesday, to rest in,” said Herbert.“But you can’t help groaning, my dear Handel.What hurt have you got?Can you stand?”"
"“可以，可以，”我说，“我可以走。我没有受伤，只是这只胳膊一抽一抽地疼。”","“Yes, yes,” said I, “I can walk.I have no hurt but in this throbbing arm.”"
"他们把我胳膊上的绷带解开，竭尽全力为我解除痛苦。胳膊红肿得厉害，一碰就疼痛难忍。不过，他们扯下自己的手帕给我当绷带用，小心翼翼地把这条胳膊包扎好、吊好，先这样凑合着挨到镇上，然后再找清凉药水来敷。不一会儿，我们就关上门，走出了这间黑乎乎、空荡荡的水闸室，回去的路上又经过了采石场。特拉布裁缝店的伙计——现在已经长成特拉布裁缝店的年轻人了——提着灯笼在前面给我们带路，我看见那从门外射进来的光就是这灯发出来的。不过，从月亮升高的高度来看，我在屋里呆了有两个小时了，因为下过雨，夜色看起来清亮了不少。我们经过的时候，石灰窑里飘出的白烟从我们身旁飘过，我之前还默默地做了一次祷告，而现在内心已满是感激之情了。","They laid it bare, and did what they could.It was violently swollen and inflamed, and I could scarcely endure to have it touched.But, they tore up their handkerchiefs to make fresh bandages, and carefully replaced it in the sling, until we could get to the town and obtain some cooling lotion to put upon it.In a little while we had shut the door of the dark and empty sluice-house, and were passing through the quarry on our way back.Trabb’s boy—Trabb’s overgrown young man now—went before us with a lantern, which was the light I had seen come in at the door.But, the moon was a good two hours higher than when I had last seen the sky, and the night though rainy was much lighter.The white vapor of the kiln was passing from us as we went by, and, as I had thought a prayer before, I thought a thanksgiving now."
"我恳求赫伯特告诉我他是怎样来救我的——起初他老是拒绝我的恳求，坚持让我别说话——后来还是告诉我了，原来匆忙之中我把那封打开的信落在屋子里了，他回家的时候，在街上碰到了斯塔特普，就带他一起回去，结果发现了这封信，那时我刚走没多久。信的口吻让他很不安，还有信上的内容和我匆忙中留给他的字条相互矛盾，这让他更加不安。他考虑了一刻钟的时间，不安之情不但没有消减，反而更加强烈了，于是决定去公共马车售票处问问，问问下一班马车什么时候开，斯塔特普自愿和他同去。结果发现下午的马车都已经开出了，他的不安也转变成了担心，眼下遇上了困难，他决定雇一辆马车前往。所以，他和斯塔特普到了“蓝野猪”饭店，满心希望能在那里找到我，或者打探到有关我的消息。可是，他们既没有看见我，也没有我的消息。然后，他们去了郝维仙小姐那里，也没有找到我。他们于是又回到“蓝野猪”饭店（无疑那个时候我正在小饭馆里听那个当地流传的有关我的故事）吃了点东西，想找个人带他们到沼泽地去。当时有一些人正在“蓝野猪”饭店的门道里闲逛，其中就有特拉布裁缝的伙计——他还是老样子，无所事事、四处乱逛——而且，正好特拉布裁缝的伙计看见我路过郝维仙小姐家往我吃饭的餐馆走去。因此，特拉布裁缝店的伙计就当了他们的向导，他们跟他一起往水闸室走去。不过他们是走镇上的大路去的，而我是有意避开大路走小路去的。他们一路走着，赫伯特心里盘算着，我可能是被什么人叫过去的，我跑这一趟可能跟普罗维斯的安全有关，他要是硬闯进去肯定会造成不堪设想的后果，于是他让他们的向导和斯塔特普留在采石场旁边，他自己一个人悄悄绕着水闸室转了两三圈，想确定里面是不是没发生什么状况。他听不见里面的声音，除了一个模模糊糊的、又沉又粗的声音（那时我正思绪万千），他甚至开始怀疑我是不是在里面，突然听见我发出一声很大的叫喊声，他赶忙响应，冲了进去，其他两个人也马上冲了进来。","Entreating Herbert to tell me how he had come to my rescue—which at first he had flatly refused to do, but had insisted on my remaining quiet—I learnt that I had in my hurry dropped the letter, open, in our chambers, where he, coming home to bring with him Startop whom he had met in the street on his way to me, found it, very soon after I was gone.Its tone made him uneasy, and the more so because of the inconsistency between it and the hasty letter I had left for him.His uneasiness increasing instead of subsiding after a quarter of an hour’s consideration, he set off for the coach-office, with Startop, who volunteered his company, to make inquiry when the next coach went down.Finding that the afternoon coach was gone, and finding that his uneasiness grew into positive alarm, as obstacles came in his way, he resolved to follow in a post-chaise.So, he and Startop arrived at the Blue Boar, fully expecting there to find me, or tidings of me; but, finding neither, went on to Miss Havisham’s, where they lost me.Hereupon they went back to the hotel (doubtless at about the time when I was hearing the popular local version of my own story), to refresh themselves and to get some one to guide them out upon the marshes.Among the loungers under the Boar’s archway, happened to be Trabb’s boy—true to his ancient habit of happening to be everywhere where he had no business—and Trabb’s boy had seen me passing from Miss Havisham’s in the direction of my dining-place.Thus, Trabb’s boy became their guide, and with him they went out to the sluice-house: though by the town way to the marshes, which I had avoided.Now, as they went along, Herbert reflected, that I might, after all, have been brought there on some genuine and serviceable errand tending to Provis’ safety, and, bethinking himself that in that case interruption must be mischievous, left his guide and Startop on the edge of the quarry, and went on by himself, and stole round the house two or three times, endeavoring to ascertain whether all was right within.As he could hear nothing but indistinct sounds of one deep rough voice (this was while my mind was so busy), he even at last began to doubt whether I was there, when suddenly I cried out loudly, and he answered the cries, and rushed in, closely followed by the other two."
"我把屋子里发生的状况告诉了赫伯特，他主张马上到镇上去报案，哪怕现在已经深夜了，也要让他们开出一张逮捕令来。不过，我考虑过了，如果这样的话，我们可能就要留在那里了，也可能还要被召回来，这样普罗维斯就可能性命难保了。这样的麻烦是肯定有的，于是我们当时就放弃了所有追捕奥立克的念头。事已至此，我们认为很有必要跟特拉布裁缝店的伙计交代清楚。我确定他非常失望，他要是早知道，他无意中一插手竟然能把我从石灰窑中救出来，他就不会这么做了。倒不是特拉布裁缝店的伙计本性有多坏，而是他精力过于旺盛，无处发泄，天性又爱变化、爱刺激，哪怕以牺牲别人为代价也在所不惜。我们分别的时候，我给了他两块金币（看来他很满意），跟他说我很抱歉以前对他的印象不好（他听了这话没有任何反应）。","When I told Herbert what had passed within the house, he was for our immediately going before a magistrate in the town, late at night as it was, and getting out a warrant.But, I had already considered that such a course, by detaining us there, or binding us to come back, might be fatal to Provis.There was no gainsaying this difficulty, and we relinquished all thoughts of pursuing Orlick at that time.For the present, under the circumstances, we deemed it prudent to make rather light of the matter to Trabb’s boy; who I am convinced would have been much affected by disappointment, if he had known that his intervention saved me from the limekiln.Not that Trabb’s boy was of a malignant nature, but that he had too much spare vivacity, and that it was in his constitution to want variety and excitement at anybody’s expense.When we parted, I presented him with two guineas (which seemed to meet his views), and told him that I was sorry ever to have had an ill opinion of him (which made no impression on him at all)."
"星期三马上就要到了，我们决定当晚赶回伦敦，三人雇了一辆马车。这样，等到当晚发生的事情开始在镇上流传的时候，我们已经离开了。赫伯特为我受伤的胳膊买了一大瓶药水，整个晚上不停地给我的胳膊涂药水，我这一路上才勉强熬过了疼痛。我们回到坦普尔的时候天色已经亮了，我一到家就往床上躺去，整整一天没下床。","Wednesday being so close upon us, we determined to go back to London that night, three in the post-chaise; the rather, as we should then be clear away, before the night’s adventure began to be talked of.Herbert got a large bottle of stuff for my arm, and by dint of having this stuff dropped over it all the night through, I was just able to bear its pain on the journey.It was daylight when we reached the Temple, and I went at once to bed, and lay in bed all day."
"我躺在那里，想到自己的伤势，想到明天的行动会很不方便，就害怕不已，这样的折腾没有把我打倒，这倒让我很是惊讶。要不是因为想到明天的行动，让我拉紧了心里的弦，在这样的精神折磨下，我肯定早就倒下了。我焦虑不安地盼望着，想着这样做的后果，时间迫近了，可结果仍是未知，不可预料。","My terror, as I lay there, of falling ill and being unfitted for tomorrow, was so besetting, that I wonder it did not disable me of itself.It would have done so, pretty surely, in conjunction with the mental wear and tear I had suffered, but for the unnatural strain upon me that tomorrow was.So anxiously looked forward to, charged with such consequences, its results so impenetrably hidden though so near."
"我们一整天不和普罗维斯联系才是最佳的预防措施，可这又增加了我的不安。每一个脚步声、每一个声响都能让我惊醒，我觉得他一定是被发现、被逮捕了，这声音是有人来告诉我这个消息的。我说服自己他被捕了，这在我心里不仅仅是害怕，也不仅仅是一种不详的预感，这是一个已经发生的事实，我对此有一种难以理解的预感。时间一点一点地过去，没有坏的消息传来，白昼渐渐消逝，夜幕已经降临，我内心隐隐担心病体在明早之前会恶化，这些担忧统统占据着我的心。我烧伤的胳膊一阵阵地抽痛，头也一阵阵地痛，我怀疑自己是不是开始神志不清了。我便开始数数，一直数下去。为了确定我没有糊涂，我又背诵了几篇我熟悉的散文和诗歌。有时由于大脑实在太累，我打了一下盹，要么就是忘了背到哪里了，然后又惊醒过来，对自己说：“我终于还是神志不清了！”","No precaution could have been more obvious than our refraining from communication with him that day; yet this again increased my restlessness.I started at every footstep and every sound, believing that he was discovered and taken, and this was the messenger to tell me so.I persuaded myself that I knew he was taken; that there was something more upon my mind than a fear or a presentiment; that the fact had occurred, and I had a mysterious knowledge of it.As the day wore on and no ill news came, as the day closed in and darkness fell, my overshadowing dread of being disabled by illness before tomorrow morning, altogether mastered me.My burning arm throbbed, and my burning head throbbed, and I fancied I was beginning to wander.I counted up to high numbers, to make sure of myself, and repeated passages that I knew in prose and verse.It happened sometimes that in the mere escape of a fatigued mind, I dozed for some moments or forgot; then I would say to myself with a start, “Now it has come, and I am turning delirious!”"
"他们让我一整天保持安静，不停地给我的胳膊换绷带，给我喝清凉饮料。每次我一睡着，就会因想起水闸室的那一幕而醒过来，以为自己睡了很长时间，错过了救伯父的时机。午夜时分，我下了床朝赫伯特房间走去，我确信我睡了整整二十四个小时，星期三已经过去了。这是我为解除焦躁进行的最后全力一搏，因为这样以后，我就沉沉地睡过去了。","They kept me very quiet all day, and kept my arm constantly dressed, and gave me cooling drinks.Whenever I fell asleep, I awoke with the notion I had had in the sluice-house, that a long time had elapsed and the opportunity to save him was gone.About midnight I got out of bed and went to Herbert, with the conviction that I had been asleep for four-and-twenty hours, and that Wednesday was past.It was the last self-exhausting effort of my fretfulness, for, after that, I slept soundly."
"我向窗外望去，星期三的早晨已经来临。桥上闪烁的灯光显得很苍白，初升的太阳像一团火焰燃烧在水平线上方。泰晤士河还是那么幽暗、神秘，一座座横跨河面的桥变成了冷冷的灰色，天空中的红霞在桥上投下了点点印记，增添了一丝暖意。我顺着一排排屋顶望去，教堂的钟楼和尖顶一直伸向清澈无比的天空。太阳升起来了，河面上仿佛升起了一层薄雾，数不胜数的小亮点在水面上跳跃着。而我呢，似乎也有一层薄雾要从我身上拉开，我觉得精神抖擞。","Wednesday morning was dawning when I looked out of window.The winking lights upon the bridges were already pale, the coming sun was like a marsh of fire on the horizon.The river, still dark and mysterious, was spanned by bridges that were turning coldly grey, with here and there at top a warm touch from the burning in the sky.As I looked along the clustered roofs, with Church towers and spires shooting into the unusually clear air, the sun rose up, and a veil seemed to be drawn from the river, and millions of sparkles burst out upon its waters.From me too, a veil seemed to be drawn, and I felt strong and well."
"赫伯特还躺在床上，我们的老同学也还在沙发上躺着。没有他们帮忙，我没法自己穿衣服，不过我把炉里尚未熄灭的火重新烧旺，给他们准备好了咖啡。没过多久，他们俩也精神抖擞地起床了。我们打开窗户让早晨清凉的空气透进来，望着奔腾不息朝我们涌来的河水。","Herbert lay asleep in his bed, and our old fellow-student lay asleep on the sofa.I could not dress myself without help, but I made up the fire, which was still burning, and got some coffee ready for them.In good time they too started up strong and well, and we admitted the sharp morning air at the windows, and looked at the tide that was still flowing towards us."
"“九点钟潮水方向改变的时候，”赫伯特兴奋地说，“你准备好，到米尔庞德岸去等我们！”","“When it turns at nine o’clock,” said Herbert, cheerfully, “look out for us, and stand ready, you over there at Mill Pond Bank!”"

"这是三月里的一天，阳光带来了暖意，和风却依然寒气袭人——阳光下有如夏天，阴凉处有如冬天。我们都穿上了粗呢短外套，我还带了一个包。在我的全部家当中，我只带了一些日常必需品，包里的东西并不多。我要去哪里，我去干什么，我什么时候能回来，这些问题都完完全全是未知数。我没有费尽心思去想这些问题，因为我心里头挂念的只有一件事，那就是普罗维斯的人身安全。只是有一个时刻我有些茫然，那是当我站在门口朝里望的时候。我心想，还有可能再回到这些房间看看吗，即使有可能，景象也大不相同了吧。","It was one of those March days when the sun shines hot and the wind blows cold: when it is summer in the light, and winter in the shade.We had our pea-coats with us, and I took a bag.Of all my worldly possessions I took no more than the few necessaries that filled the bag.Where I might go, what I might do, or when I might return, were questions utterly unknown to me; nor did I vex my mind with them, for it was wholly set on Provis’ safety.I only wondered for the passing moment, as I stopped at the door and looked back, under what altered circumstances I should next see those rooms, if ever."
"第五十五章","Chapter 55"
"第二天他就被送到治安法庭去了，本来很快就要判他的罪的，不过有必要先派人去他当年逃脱的监狱船上，请一位知道他案情的狱吏来，以证明他的身份。对于此案没有人表示怀疑，不过，康培生在水里这么一扑腾就送了命，本来他是可以出庭作证的，而且偏偏当时伦敦又找不到一个可以提供必要证明的狱吏。我回到伦敦的当晚就直接去贾格尔斯先生的私人宅第找他了，请求他帮忙。站在犯人的立场上，贾格尔斯说绝不要招供。这是唯一的办法，他告诉我说，只要证人一到，这个案子铁定五分钟内就能结了，局面对我们不利，要想逆转局面，怕是回天乏术。","He was taken to the Police Court next day, and would have been immediately committed for trial, but that it was necessary to send down for an old officer of the prison-ship from which he had once escaped, to speak to his identity.Nobody doubted it; but, Compeyson, who had meant to depose to it, was tumbling on the tides, dead, and it happened that there was not at that time any prison officer in London who could give the required evidence.I had gone direct to Mr. Jaggers at his private house, on my arrival over night, to retain his assistance, and Mr. Jaggers on the prisoner’s behalf would admit nothing.It was the sole resource, for he told me that the case must be over in five minutes when the witness was there, and that no power on earth could prevent its going against us."
"我向贾格尔斯先生透露，我打算瞒住马格维奇，不让他知道他的财产已经被没收了。贾格尔斯先生一听，对我又气又恼，说我“让钱从指缝中溜走了”，还说我们得马上去请愿，不管怎样，能要回来一部分是一部分。不过，他也没有对我隐瞒，他说虽然可能有很多案子判下来能免于没收财产，但这个案子情况不同，它不具有免于没收财产的条件。这点我很明白。我和逃犯既不是亲属关系，也没有任何易于辨认的关系，他被捕前既没有为我立下字据，也没有和我签下协议，现在补办也只能是徒劳。我没有提出要求，我最终做出决定，并且之后一直遵守着我的决定，那就是，决不贪图这毫无希望之财。","I imparted to Mr. Jaggers my design of keeping him in ignorance of the fate of his wealth.Mr. Jaggers was querulous and angry with me for having “let it slip through my fingers,” and said we must memorialize by-and-by, and try at all events for some of it.But, he did not conceal from me that although there might be many cases in which the forfeiture would not be exacted, there were no circumstances in this case to make it one of them.I understood that, very well.I was not related to the outlaw, or connected with him by any recognizable tie; he had put his hand to no writing or settlement in my favour before his apprehension, and to do so now would be idle.I had no claim, and I finally resolved, and ever afterwards abided by the resolution, that my heart should never be sickened with the hopeless task of attempting to establish one."
"似乎有理由这样设想，那位溺水而亡的告密者本来是希望从这笔充公的财产中大捞一笔的，他事先已经得知了一些关于马格维奇的确切消息。他的尸体是在他死亡地点数英里之外发现的，尸体被发现时已经面目全非，只是通过他口袋里的东西才得以辨认。他口袋里有一个夹子，里面折叠着几张字条，上面的字迹还清晰可辨。一张字条上写的是新南威尔士的一家银行的名字，上面记载着马格维奇有多少存款，还有的字条上写着马格维奇有几处地产，价值不菲。马格维奇在狱中的时候，就把这些财产的清单交给了贾格尔斯先生，他以为这些财产应该会由我来继承。可怜的人，他的无知最终还是对他起了安慰的作用，他认为在贾格尔斯先生的帮助下，我继承这笔财产是十拿九稳的，他从未怀疑过这一点。","There appeared to be reason for supposing that the drowned informer had hoped for a reward out of this forfeiture, and had obtained some accurate knowledge of Magwitch’s affairs.When his body was found, many miles from the scene of his death, and so horribly disfigured that he was only recognizable by the contents of his pockets, notes were still legible, folded in a case he carried.Among these, was the name of a banking-house in New South Wales where a sum of money was, and the designation of certain lands of considerable value.Both these heads of information were in a list that Magwitch, while in prison, gave to Mr. Jaggers, of the possessions he supposed I should inherit.His ignorance, poor fellow, at last served him; he never mistrusted but that my inheritance was quite safe, with Mr. Jaggers’ aid."
"案件延迟了三天才审理，这三天里皇家检察署等着监狱船上的证人过来。三天后证人来了，这桩简单的案件也就结了。对他的审判于定下次开庭时受理，下次开庭是一个月后。","After three days’ delay, during which the crown prosecution stood over for the production of the witness from the prison-ship, the witness came, and completed the easy case.He was committed to take his trial at the next Sessions, which would come on in a month."
"在我人生中这一黑暗时期，一天晚上，赫伯特回来了，神情十分沮丧地对我说：","It was at this dark time of my life that Herbert returned home one evening, a good deal cast down, and said:"
"“我亲爱的汉德尔，我恐怕不久就得离开你了。”","“My dear Handel, I fear I shall soon have to leave you.”"
"他的合伙人已经事先让我做好了心理准备，所以我并没有他想象的那么惊讶。","His partner having prepared me for that, I was less surprised than he thought."
"“这一次去开罗，如果我拖延的话，就要错过一次良机了，汉德尔，在你最需要我的时候，我却恐怕不得不离开了。”","“We shall lose a fine opportunity if I put off going to Cairo, and I am very much afraid I must go, Handel, when you most need me.”"
"“赫伯特，我一直都需要你，因为我一直都爱你，可我并不是现在最需要你，我其他时候也需要你。”","“Herbert, I shall always need you, because I shall always love you; but my need is no greater now, than at another time.”"
"“你会很孤独的。”","“You will be so lonely.”"
"“我没空去想这个。”我说，“你知道，只要时间允许，我会尽可能地陪着他，只要我可以，我会成天和他在一起。我不和他在一起的时候，你知道，我脑子里想的也都是他。”","“I have not leisure to think of that,” said I.“You know that I am always with him to the full extent of the time allowed, and that I should be with him all day long, if I could.And when I come away from him, you know that my thoughts are with him.”"
"他现在陷入了如此糟糕的境地，我们都吓坏了，我们没法用更直白的话语来提起他的处境。","The dreadful condition to which he was brought, was so appalling to both of us, that we could not refer to it in plainer words."
"“我亲爱的伙伴，”赫伯特说，“我们分别在即——近在眼前——看在这一点上，我有理由麻烦你一件事，我麻烦你为你自己想想。你想过你的将来吗？”","“My dear fellow,” said Herbert, “let the near prospect of our separation—for, it is very near—be my justification for troubling you about yourself.Have you thought of your future?”"
"“没有，因为一直不敢想什么将来。”","“No, for I have been afraid to think of any future.”"
"“但你不能不考虑啊，真的，我最最亲爱的汉德尔，这不能不考虑啊。我希望你现在就开始考虑，跟我好好谈一谈，哪怕就几句知心话。”","“But yours cannot be dismissed; indeed, my dear dear Handel, it must not be dismissed.I wish you would enter on it now, as far as a few friendly words go, with me.”"
"“好的。”我说。","“I will,” said I."
"“汉德尔，我们分公司正需要一位——”","“In this branch house of ours, Handel, we must have a—”"
"我看得出来，他很细心地避免用那个确切的词，于是我插话了：“一位职员。”","I saw that his delicacy was avoiding the right word, so I said, “A clerk.”"
"“一位职员。我看，职员要发展成为股东，也不是完全不可能的（你的老相识我不就从一位办事员发展成一名股东了吗）。那么，汉德尔——一句话，我亲爱的伙计，你愿意到我公司里来吗？”","“A clerk.And I hope it is not at all unlikely that he may expand (as a clerk of your acquaintance has expanded) into a partner.Now, Handel—in short, my dear boy, will you come to me?”"
"他说“那么，汉德尔”的时候，语气十分真诚、十分吸引人，好像是一次商务发言的庄重的开头语。突然他换了一种语调，坦诚地伸出手来，像个学童那样地说道：","There was something charmingly cordial and engaging in the manner in which after saying “Now, Handel,” as if it were the grave beginning of a portentous business exordium, he had suddenly given up that tone, stretched out his honest hand, and spoken like a schoolboy."
"“关于这事，克拉拉和我谈过很多次。”赫伯特接着说道，“这可爱的小东西今晚还泪眼汪汪地恳求我呢，她说等和我结婚后，要是你愿意和我们住在一起，她会尽可能地让你开心，她要让她丈夫的朋友相信，她丈夫的朋友也就是她的朋友。我们会相处得很好的，汉德尔！”","“Clara and I have talked about it again and again,” Herbert pursued, “and the dear little thing begged me only this evening, with tears in her eyes, to say to you that if you will live with us when we come together, she will do her best to make you happy, and to convince her husband’s friend that he is her friend too.We should get on so well, Handel!”"
"我衷心地感谢她，也衷心地感谢赫伯特，不过我说我还不能确定是否接受他这一好心的提议，加入他的行业。首先，我的心思已经被占据了，我没法考虑清楚这个事情。其次——是的！其次，还有一件不确切的事情萦绕在我的脑际，这事要到我这自述的尾声才能知晓。","I thanked her heartily, and I thanked him heartily, but said I could not yet make sure of joining him as he so kindly offered.Firstly, my mind was too preoccupied to be able to take in the subject clearly.Secondly—Yes!Secondly, there was a vague something lingering in my thoughts that will come out very near the end of this slight narrative."
"“可是，赫伯特，要是你觉得对你的事业没有什么害处的话，你可以暂时先缓一缓，再等我的答复——”","“But if you thought, Herbert, that you could, without doing any injury to your business, leave the question open for a little while—”"
"“缓多久都行，”赫伯特说，“六个月，一年！”","“For any while,” cried Herbert.“Six months, a year!”"
"“没有那么久，”我说，“最多两三个月。”","“Not so long as that,” said I.“Two or three months at most.”"
"我们就这事达成一致后，赫伯特十分开心地说，他现在可以鼓起勇气告诉我一件事，他想他这个周末就得走了。","Herbert was highly delighted when we shook hands on this arrangement, and said he could now take courage to tell me that he believed he must go away at the end of the week."
"“那克拉拉怎么办？”我问。","“And Clara?” said I."
"“这可爱的小东西，”赫伯特说，“只要他老父亲还活一天，她就要尽一天孝道，不过他活不久了。温博尔夫人跟我透露，他活不了多久了。”","“The dear little thing,” returned Herbert, “holds dutifully to her father as long as he lasts; but he won’t last long.Mrs. Whimple confides to me that he is certainly going.”"
"“不是我要说得这么难听，”我说，“他死了倒更好。”","“Not to say an unfeeling thing,” said I, “he cannot do better than go.”"
"“我恐怕不得不承认这一点，”赫伯特说，“那时我就可以为了我可爱的小东西回来，这可爱的小东西就要和我一起，安安静静地走进最近的一座教堂。记住！我这幸福的小甜甜家世十分普通，我亲爱的汉德尔，她从来没有查过家谱，而且对她祖父一点印象都没有。我母亲的儿子多么幸福啊！”","“I am afraid that must be admitted,” said Herbert: “and then I shall come back for the dear little thing, and the dear little thing and I will walk quietly into the nearest church.Remember!The blessed darling comes of no family, my dear Handel, and never looked into the red book, and hasn’t a notion about her grandpapa.What a fortune for the son of my mother!”"
"就在那个星期的星期六，我跟赫伯特告别了——他怀着对未来的无限憧憬，以及要离开我的满腔愁绪——坐上了一艘远洋邮轮。我走进一家咖啡馆，在那里给克拉拉写了一封短信，告诉她赫伯特走了，一遍又一遍地转达赫伯特对她的爱意，然后回到了我空荡荡的家——如果它还能称得上“家”的话，这里对我来说不再是家了，我已经没有家了。","On the Saturday in that same week, I took my leave of Herbert—full of bright hope, but sad and sorry to leave me—as he sat on one of the seaport mail coaches.I went into a coffee-house to write a little note to Clara, telling her he had gone off, sending his love to her over and over again, and then went to my lonely home—if it deserved the name, for it was now no home to me, and I had no home anywhere."
"我在楼梯上碰到了温米克，他正从楼上下来，他是来找我的，见敲门没人应就下来了。自从那次出逃失败后我还没单独见过他，他这次来是以私人和个人的身份，就我们那次失败的出逃事件作一个解释的。","On the stairs I encountered Wemmick, who was coming down, after an unsuccessful application of his knuckles to my door.I had not seen him alone, since the disastrous issue of the attempted flight; and he had come, in his private and personal capacity, to say a few words of explanation in reference to that failure."
"“那个死去的康培生，”温米克说，“一点一点地把整个事情弄得一清二楚了，所有这些都是我从他的几个惹了麻烦的手下那里打听来的（他的一些手下总是惹麻烦）。我在他们说话的时候装作充耳不闻，其实我在竖起耳朵听呢，上次我听说康培生不在伦敦，我想那是尝试出逃的最佳时机。我现在才料到，这是他的策略之一，他是个十分聪明的人，对自己的心腹也总是耍手段。我想你不会怪我吧，皮普先生？我保证我是真心诚意地想帮你。”","“The late Compeyson,” said Wemmick, “had by little and little got at the bottom of half of the regular business now transacted, and it was from the talk of some of his people in trouble (some of his people being always in trouble) that I heard what I did.I kept my ears open, seeming to have them shut, until I heard that he was absent, and I thought that would be the best time for making the attempt.I can only suppose now, that it was a part of his policy, as a very clever man, habitually to deceive his own instruments.You don’t blame me, I hope, Mr. Pip?I am sure I tried to serve you, with all my heart.”"
"“我保证相信你的话，温米克，就像你的保证一样，我诚挚地谢谢你给我的关心和友爱。”","“I am as sure of that, Wemmick, as you can be, and I thank you most earnestly for all your interest and friendship.”"
"“谢谢你，非常感谢你。我做了一件错事。”温米克抓着头皮说，“我敢说我很久没做过这样的错事了。这一次，一大笔动产没了。天啊！”","“Thank you, thank you very much.It’s a bad job,” said Wemmick, scratching his head, “and I assure you I haven’t been so cut up for a long time.What I look at, is the sacrifice of so much portable property.Dear me!”"
"“温米克，我想到的是这笔财产的可怜的所有者。”","“What I think of, Wemmick, is the poor owner of the property.”"
"“是的，当然，”温米克说，“你为他感到难过，这我没有异议，要是能救出他，就是拿出一张五英镑的支票出来我也愿意。可我有我的看法。那个死去的康培生早就获得情报，知道马格维奇已经回国了，铁了心要让他吃官司，我看他是逃不掉的。可是，动产本来是一定能救出来的。这就是动产和动产所有者之间的区别，你没看出来吗？”","“Yes, to be sure,” said Wemmick.“Of course there can be no objection to your being sorry for him, and I’d put down a five-pound note myself to get him out of it.But what I look at, is this.The late Compeyson having been beforehand with him in intelligence of his return, and being so determined to bring him to book, I do not think he could have been saved.Whereas, the portable property certainly could have been saved.That’s the difference between the property and the owner, don’t you see?”"
"我邀请温米克上楼喝杯烈性酒提提神，然后再回沃尔沃斯。他接受了我的邀请。他喝着一小杯酒，显得有些坐立不安，突然就转了话题，说：","I invited Wemmick to come up-stairs, and refresh himself with a glass of grog before walking to Walworth.He accepted the invitation.While he was drinking his moderate allowance, he said, with nothing to lead up to it, and after having appeared rather fidgety:"
"“我星期一想休息一天，你看怎样，皮普先生？”","“What do you think of my meaning to take a holiday on Monday, Mr. Pip?”"
"“嗯，我想你这十二个月来没有休息过一天吧。”","“Why, I suppose you have not done such a thing these twelve months.”"
"“更确切地说，是这十二年来。”温米克说，“是的。我想休息一天。还有，我想出去走走。还有，我想邀请你陪我一起出去走走。”","“These twelve years, more likely,” said Wemmick.“Yes.I’m going to take a holiday.More than that; I’m going to take a walk.More than that; I’m going to ask you to take a walk with me.”"
"我正要请他谅解，说在这个时候我不是个合适的同伴，可是温米克料到我会这么说。","I was about to excuse myself, as being but a bad companion just then, when Wemmick anticipated me."
"“我知道你有事情，”他说，“我也知道你心情不好，皮普先生。不过如果你能答应我这个请求，我会把这看做是你的一片好意。不需要走很远，早上出发。可能就占用你从八点到十二点的时间吧（包括早餐时间在内）。你不能破例让步，尽量过来吗？”","“I know your engagements,” said he, “and I know you are out of sorts, Mr. Pip.But if you could oblige me, I should take it as a kindness.It ain’t a long walk, and it’s an early one.Say it might occupy you (including breakfast on the walk) from eight to twelve.Couldn’t you stretch a point and manage it?”"
"他之前帮过我不少忙，他让我帮的这个忙根本算不上什么。我说我尽量过来——尽量过来——我同意了，这让他非常高兴，我也高兴了起来。由于他的特别请求，我们约好星期一早上八点半我去他的宅子叫他，谈妥之后，我们就此告别。","He had done so much for me at various times, that this was very little to do for him.I said I could manage it—would manage it—and he was so very much pleased by my acquiescence, that I was pleased too.At his particular request, I appointed to call for him at the Castle at half-past eight on Monday morning, and so we parted for the time."
"星期一早上我准时赴约，到了宅子后，我拉了拉门上的铃，温米克亲自出来迎接我，他穿得比平日更考究，还戴了一顶时髦的帽子，这副打扮让我颇为吃惊。屋内已备好了两杯兑了牛奶的朗姆酒，还有两份饼干。老人家一定是被云雀吵醒了，因为我朝他的卧室望去，发现他的床上空空的。","Punctual to my appointment, I rang at the Castle gate on the Monday morning, and was received by Wemmick himself: who struck me as looking tighter than usual, and having a sleeker hat on.Within, there were two glasses of rum-and-milk prepared, and two biscuits.The Aged must have been stirring with the lark, for, glancing into the perspective of his bedroom, I observed that his bed was empty."
"我们喝完兑了牛奶的朗姆酒，吃完饼干，体力补充得满满的，正打算出去走走，把这补充的体力消耗掉，只见温米克拿出一根钓鱼竿，把它往肩上一扛，我很吃惊。“嘿，我们可不是去钓鱼的！”我说。“不去钓鱼，”温米克说，“不过我喜欢带根钓鱼竿散步。”","When we had fortified ourselves with the rum-and-milk and biscuits, and were going out for the walk with that training preparation on us, I was considerably surprised to see Wemmick take up a fishing-rod, and put it over his shoulder.“Why, we are not going fishing!” said I.“No,” returned Wemmick, “but I like to walk with one.”"
"我虽然觉得蹊跷，但什么也没说，我们出发了。我们朝坎布威尔草地的方向走去，快到的时候，温米克突然说：","I thought this odd; however, I said nothing, and we set off.We went towards Camberwell Green, and when we were thereabouts, Wemmick said suddenly:"
"“啊呀！这里有一个教堂！”","“Halloa!Here’s a church!”"
"这本来没什么好惊讶的，可他这么一喊，让我又一次吃了一惊，他似乎有了个绝妙的想法，兴奋不已：","There was nothing very surprising in that; but a gain, I was rather surprised, when he said, as if he were animated by a brilliant idea:"
"“我们进去吧！”","“Let’s go in!”"
"我们走了进去，温米克把他的钓鱼竿放在门廊上，然后张望了一下四周。同时，他把手伸进他的大衣口袋里，掏出一件纸包的东西。","We went in, Wemmick leaving his fishing-rod in the porch, and looked all round.In the mean time, Wemmick was diving into his coat-pockets, and getting something out of paper there."
"“啊呀！”他说，“这里有两副手套！我们戴上吧！”","“Halloa!” said he.“Here’s a couple of pair of gloves!Let’s put ’em on!”"
"手套是白色小山羊皮做的，他那邮筒似的嘴张得不能再大了，这才引起了我最大的疑心。直到我看见老人家从一扇边门进来，还挽着一位小姐，我的疑心才得到了证实。","As the gloves were white kid gloves, and as the post-office was widened to its utmost extent, I now began to have my strong suspicions.They were strengthened into certainty when I beheld the Aged enter at a side door, escorting a lady."
"“啊呀！”温米克说，“司琪芬小姐来了！那么婚礼开始吧。”","“Halloa!” said Wemmick.“Here’s Miss Skiffins!Let’s have a wedding.”"
"这位谨慎的少女像往常一样装扮，只是她正换下那副绿色山羊羔皮手套，换上了一副白色的。老人家也正忙着为婚姻女神的祭坛准备一件同样的祭品。不过这位老先生怎么也戴不上他那副手套，温米克不得不让老人家背靠教堂的柱子，然后他自己站到柱子的后面，去帮他把手套戴上，我也过来抱住老人家的腰，这样双方力量平衡，能够稳得住。用这个巧妙的办法，他的手套总算是完美地戴上了。","That discreet damsel was attired as usual, except that she was now engaged in substituting for her green kid gloves, a pair of white.The Aged was likewise occupied in preparing a similar sacrifice for the altar of Hymen.The old gentleman, however, experienced so much difficulty in getting his gloves on, that Wemmick found it necessary to put him with his back against a pillar, and then to get behind the pillar himself and pull away at them, while I for my part held the old gentleman round the waist, that he might present and equal and safe resistance.By dint of this ingenious Scheme, his gloves were got on to perfection."
"教堂的牧师和执事走了出来，我们在那些决定命运的栏杆前站成一排。温米克看起来好像事先毫无准备的样子，婚礼仪式开始之前，他从背心口袋里掏出来一样东西，自言自语地说：“啊呀！这里有一个戒指！”","The clerk and clergyman then appearing, we were ranged in order at those fatal rails.True to his notion of seeming to do it all without preparation, I heard Wemmick say to himself as he took something out of his waistcoat-pocket before the service began, “Halloa!Here’s a ring!”"
"我扮演的是陪新郎的角色，也就是伴郎，而一位身材娇小、柔弱无力、戴着一顶婴儿式软帽的领座员，扮演了司芬琪小姐闺蜜的角色。嫁姑娘的责任就落到了老人家身上。结果老人家让牧师大为不快，虽然他不是存心的，事情是这样的：当牧师问道：“是谁把这位小姐嫁给这位先生的？”这位老先生压根不知道仪式进行到哪一步了，只是站在那里笑嘻嘻地看着墙上的十诫。牧师于是又问了一遍：“是谁把这位小姐嫁给这位先生的？”这位老先生仍然毫无知觉，新郎用往常的声音对他喊道：“老父亲，是谁嫁女儿，你知道吧？”老人家没说是谁嫁女儿，却无比欢快地回答他：“好的，约翰，好的，我的孩子！”这时牧师一脸阴沉地停顿了一下，我当时真怀疑我们当天能否顺利完成婚礼。","I acted in the capacity of backer, or best-man, to the bridegroom; while a little limp pew opener in a soft bonnet like a baby’s, made a feint of being the bosom friend of Miss Skiffins.The responsibility of giving the lady away, devolved upon the Aged, which led to the clergyman’s being unintentionally scandalized, and it happened thus.When he said, “Who giveth this woman to be married to this man?” the old gentlemen, not in the least knowing what point of the ceremony we had arrived at, stood most amiably beaming at the ten commandments.Upon which, the clergyman said again, “WHO giveth this woman to be married to this man?”The old gentleman being still in a state of most estimable unconsciousness, the bridegroom cried out in his accustomed voice, “Now Aged P. you know; who giveth?”To which the Aged replied with great briskness, before saying that he gave, “All right, John, all right, my boy!”And the clergyman came to so gloomy a pause upon it, that I had doubts for the moment whether we should get completely married that day."
"不过婚礼还是完成了。我们走出教堂的时候，温米克取下圣水盆的盖子，把他的白手套放了进去，然后又把盖子盖上了。温米克夫人采取了对未来更加谨慎的态度，她把白手套放回口袋，又戴上了她那副绿手套。“皮普先生，”我们出去后，温米克得意洋洋地扛起那根钓鱼竿，“我问问你，谁会想到这里举行了一场婚礼！”","It was completely done, however, and when we were going out of church, Wemmick took the cover off the font, and put his white gloves in it, and put the cover on again.Mrs. Wemmick, more heedful of the future, put her white gloves in her pocket and assumed her green.“Now, Mr. Pip,” said Wemmick, triumphantly shouldering the fishing-rod as we came out, “let me ask you whether anybody would suppose this to be a wedding-party!”"
"早餐已经订好，位于距草地一英里左右的坡上的一家舒适的小酒馆里，屋里有一张台球桌，以备我们在庄严肃穆的婚礼后放松心情之用。温米克用胳膊搂住她的腰时，温米克太太不再把他的手松开了。她坐在靠墙的一把扶手转椅上，就像一把装在匣里的大提琴，就像那能奏出优美旋律的乐器，当琴师需要演奏的时候，就任其抱住，看到这景象我真高兴。","Breakfast had been ordered at a pleasant little tavern, a mile or so away upon the rising ground beyond the Green, and there was a bagatelle board in the room, in case we should desire to unbend our minds after the solemnity.It was pleasant to observe that Mrs. Wemmick no longer unwound Wemmick’s arm when it adapted itself to her figure, but sat in a high-backed chair against the wall, like a violoncello in its case, and submitted to be embraced as that melodious instrument might have done."
"我们享受了一顿丰盛的早餐，要是谁没有吃哪样点心，温米克就会说：“这都是预订好了的，放心地吃吧！”我向这对新人敬酒，向老人家敬酒，向宅子敬酒，辞别的时候又向新娘致意，尽量让自己使人愉快。","We had an excellent breakfast, and when any one declined anything on table, Wemmick said, “Provided by contract, you know; don’t be afraid of it!”I drank to the new couple, drank to the Aged, drank to the Castle, saluted the bride at parting, and made myself as agreeable as I could."
"温米克跟我一起走到门口，我又一次跟他握了手，并祝他开心。","Wemmick came down to the door with me, and I again shook hands with him, and wished him joy."
"“谢谢！”温米克一边搓着手一边说道，“你不知道，她可是个养家禽的能手呢。你应该来尝一尝我们的鸡蛋，然后做出判断。我说，皮普先生！”他把我叫了回来，低声对我说，“这完全是沃尔沃斯的心情。”","“Thankee!” said Wemmick, rubbing his hands.“She’s such a manager of fowls, you have no idea.You shall have some eggs, and judge for yourself.I say, Mr. Pip!” calling me back, and speaking low.“This is altogether a Walworth sentiment, please.”"
"“我明白。我不会在小不列颠街提起这事的。”我说。","“I understand.Not to be mentioned in Little Britain,” said I."
"温米克点了点头说：“你那天虽然泄露出的我宅子秘密，贾格尔斯先生恐怕没深究呢。他可能会觉得我变得心慈手软了什么的。”","Wemmick nodded.“After what you let out the other day, Mr. Jaggers may as well not know of it.He might think my brain was softening, or something of the kind.”"
"第五十六章","Chapter 56"
"从他上一次受审到下一次开庭的整个期间，他都在监狱里躺着，病得十分厉害。他断了两根肋骨，一侧的肺也因此受了伤，每一次呼吸都万分困难、万分痛苦，这种困难和痛苦与日俱增。由于伤痛，他说话声音很低，低到几乎听不见，所以他干脆少说话。不过，他倒是很乐意听我说，所以，我把我认为他应该听的都说给他听、读给他听，这便成为了我生命中的第一要务。","He lay in prison very ill, during the whole interval between his committal for trial, and the coming round of the Sessions.He had broken two ribs, they had wounded one of his lungs, and he breathed with great pain and difficulty, which increased daily.It was a consequence of his hurt, that he spoke so low as to be scarcely audible; therefore, he spoke very little.But, he was ever ready to listen to me, and it became the first duty of my life to say to him, and read to him, what I knew he ought to hear."
"由于他病得太重，不能在普通牢房里呆下去了，一两天后，他就被送到了监狱的病房里。这倒给了我和他在一起的机会，否则是不可能的。要不是因为他的病，他早就戴上手铐脚镣了，大家都认为他是一个彻彻底底的越狱犯，还有别的说法，只是我没有听到而已。","Being far too ill to remain in the common prison, he was removed, after the first day or so, into the infirmary.This gave me opportunities of being with him that I could not otherwise have had.And but for his illness he would have been put in irons, for he was regarded as a determined prison-breaker, and I know not what else."
"虽然我每天都能见到他，但每次也只能见一会儿，因此，从我们上一次分开到下一次相见，他身体状况哪怕有一丁点变化我都能从他的脸上看出来。我不记得有哪次见他时，他的病情是有所好转的。自从监狱大门在他身后关上的那天起，他就瘦了，一天比一天瘦，病情也一天比一天重。","Although I saw him every day, it was for only a short time; hence, the regularly recurring spaces of our separation were long enough to record on his face any slight changes that occurred in his physical state.I do not recollect that I once saw any change in it for the better; he wasted, and became slowly weaker and worse, day by day, from the day when the prison door closed upon him."
"他表现出来的那种顺从和听话，就像一个筋疲力尽的人所表现出来的一样。有时候，他的行为举止或者无意中脱口而出的一两句低声的话语，让我感觉他在思考这么一个问题：如果他身处的是一个更好的环境，他是不是可以成为一个更好的人。不过，他从来没有明确表示过他的这种想法，也没有表示对既往之事有什么懊悔之意。","The kind of submission or resignation that he showed, was that of a man who was tired out.I sometimes derived an impression, from his manner or from a whispered word or two which escaped him, that he pondered over the question whether he might have been a better man under better circumstances.But, he never justified himself by a hint tending that way, or tried to bend the past out of its eternal shape."
"有两三次我去看他的时候，听到某个派来照料他的人说，他是个孤注一掷的人。他听了这话，脸上掠过一丝笑意。他转过脸用信任的眼神看着我，好像他相信，即使在多年前当我还是个孩子的时候，我就看出了他的一丝悔意。至于其他时间，他都是恭顺而心怀悔悟之意的，我从没听他抱怨过。","It happened on two or three occasions in my presence, that his desperate reputation was alluded to by one or other of the people in attendance on him.A smile crossed his face then, and he turned his eyes on me with a trustful look, as if he were confident that I had seen some small redeeming touch in him, even so long ago as when I was a little child.As to all the rest, he was humble and contrite, and I never knew him complain."
"到了开庭的日期，贾格尔斯先生提交了一项申请，请求把他的案子延至下一次开庭时审理。很明显，他这么做是因为马格维奇显然已经时日不多了，但法庭否决了他的申请。审判即刻进行，马格维奇被送上了被告席，坐在一把椅子里。法庭允许我坐在靠近被告席的地方，就坐在被告席外面，我握着他从里面向我伸出的手。","When the Sessions came round, Mr. Jaggers caused an application to be made for the postponement of his trial until the following Sessions.It was obviously made with the assurance that he could not live so long, and was refused.The trial came on at once, and, when he was put to the bar, he was seated in a chair.No objection was made to my getting close to the dock, on the outside of it, and holding the hand that he stretched forth to me."
"审判进行得十分简短，也十分清楚。凡是能为他说的话都说了——比如，他已养成了勤勉的习惯，他勤劳致富的方法是合法的、是受到大家好评的。不过，他潜逃回国的事实却是无法改变的，他现在就坐在法官和陪审团的面前。如果这样都不能定他的罪，还要判他无罪，那是不可能的。","The trial was very short and very clear.Such things as could be said for him, were said—how he had taken to industrious habits, and had thriven lawfully and reputably.But, nothing could unsay the fact that he had returned, and was there in presence of the Judge and Jury.It was impossible to try him for that, and do otherwise than find him guilty."
"在那个年代，法庭中保留了一个惯例（我是从那次庭审旁听的可怕经历中得知的），那就是要等到最后一天来宣判审判结果，宣判死刑要留到最后，以达到终结的效果。至今，我脑海中还保留着对当时情景的无法磨灭的记忆，即使在我今天写下这件事的时候，仍然觉得难以置信。当时我看见三十二个男女犯人一齐被押到法官面前，等候审判结果。在这三十二个人当中，马格维奇排在最前面，他被安排坐着，以便能保住一口气勉强活命。","At that time, it was the custom (as I learnt from my terrible experience of that Sessions) to devote a concluding day to the passing of Sentences, and to make a finishing effect with the Sentence of Death.But for the indelible picture that my remembrance now holds before me, I could scarcely believe, even as I write these words, that I saw two-and-thirty men and women put before the Judge to receive that sentence together.Foremost among the two-and-thirty, was he; seated, that he might get breath enough to keep life in him."
"整个这一幕此刻又栩栩如生地浮现在我的眼前，四月的雨点打在法院的窗玻璃上，在四月的阳光下闪耀着点点光芒。我又一次站到被告席旁的一个角落里，握住了他的手，和他一起关在被告席里的还有那三十二名男女犯人，有的蔑视法庭，有的恐惧不已，有的哭哭啼啼，有的双手掩面，有的茫然四顾。有的女犯人发出了尖叫的声音，不过被制止了，叫声停了下来，法庭要求她们肃静。司法长官们身上挂着厚重的表链，佩戴着花束，法庭其他的小官们、法警们、庭丁们，还有一大群挤得满满的旁听的人——就像剧院里满满的观众一样——看着这三十二名犯人和法官严肃地对峙着。接着，法官对他们说话了。在他面前这些可怜的犯人当中，他有必要特别指出一位，这个人几乎从孩提时代起就跟法律对着干，这个人屡次被捕入狱，屡次受罚，结果被判了几年流放，这个人胆大妄为，采取施暴手段，越狱而逃，结果又被判处终身流放。这个不幸的人远离了犯案之地，似乎一度对自己的罪行有所悔悟，并且开始安分守已地过日子。可是在某个重要关头，他屈服于自己的天性和冲动之情，重蹈昔日危害社会之覆辙，他离开休养和忏悔之地，擅自回国，须知被判终生流放的犯人是禁止回国的。他一回国就被告发，曾一度成功躲避了司法的追查，但最终还是在出逃的过程中被捕，他坚决抵抗，并且——究竟是蓄意谋害，还是出于鲁莽，只有他自己最清楚——造成了对他的全部罪行了如指掌的告发者的死亡。根据法律，对于潜逃回国的流放犯应当判处死刑，而他的罪行情节更为严重，必须判处死刑。","The whole scene starts out again in the vivid colours of the moment, down to the drops of April rain on the windows of the court, glittering in the rays of April sun.Penned in the dock, as I again stood outside it at the corner with his hand in mine, were the two-and-thirty men and women; some defiant, some stricken with terror, some sobbing and weeping, some covering their faces, some staring gloomily about.There had been shrieks from among the women convicts, but they had been stilled, a hush had succeeded.The sheriffs with their great chains and nosegays, other civic gewgaws and monsters, criers, ushers, a great gallery full of people—a large theatrical audience—looked on, as the two-and-thirty and the Judge were solemnly confronted.Then, the Judge addressed them.Among the wretched creatures before him whom he must single out for special address, was one who almost from his infancy had been an offender against the laws; who, after repeated imprisonments and punishments, had been at length sentenced to exile for a term of years; and who, under circumstances of great violence and daring had made his escape and been re-sentenced to exile for life.That miserable man would seem for a time to have become convinced of his errors, when far removed from the scenes of his old offences, and to have lived a peaceable and honest life.But in a fatal moment, yielding to those propensities and passions, the indulgence of which had so long rendered him a scourge to society, he had quitted his haven of rest and repentance, and had come back to the country where he was proscribed.Being here presently denounced, he had for a time succeeded in evading the officers of Justice, but being at length seized while in the act of flight, he had resisted them, and had—he best knew whether by express design, or in the blindness of his hardihood—caused the death of his denouncer, to whom his whole career was known.The appointed punishment for his return to the land that had cast him out, being Death, and his case being this aggravated case, he must prepare himself to Die."
"阳光透过法院的大玻璃窗照射进来，窗上还挂着雨点，在阳光下闪闪发光。一大束阳光照在这三十二名犯人和法官之间，把他们联系在了一起，这也许是在提醒观众席中的某些人，无论是法官还是犯人，都必须无区别对待地接受全知全能、永不犯错的大法官（上帝）的审判。这时有人站了起来，阳光投下的斑点在那张脸上清晰可见，这名犯人说话了：“法官大人，我已经从上帝那里接受了死刑的宣判，我听从您的判决。”然后又坐下了。此时法庭要求大家肃静，法官继续对其他犯人发表他要发表的言论。接下来，犯人一个一个听取了正式宣判，有的是被人扶着出去的，有的憔悴的脸上带着勇敢的神态，信步走了出去，有的对旁听席点点头，有两三个人在握手告别，还有的人抓起随处散落的香草叶碎片，放进嘴里嚼了起来。他是最后一个走的，因为他得靠人把他从椅子上扶起来，他走得非常慢。等其他犯人都走了以后，他握住我的手，这时旁听席上的人也起身了（整理一下衣服，就像他们在教堂或其他什么场合所做的那样），指指这个或那个犯人，大多数人指的都是他和我。","The sun was striking in at the great windows of the court, through the glittering drops of rain upon the glass, and it made a broad shaft of light between the two-and-thirty and the Judge, linking both together, and perhaps reminding some among the audience, how both were passing on, with absolute equality, to the greater Judgment that knoweth all things and cannot err.Rising for a moment, a distinct speck of face in this way of light, the prisoner said, “My Lord, I have received my sentence of Death from the Almighty, but I bow to yours,” and sat down again.There was some hushing, and the Judge went on with what he had to say to the rest.Then, they were all formally doomed, and some of them were supported out, and some of them sauntered out with a haggard look of bravery, and a few nodded to the gallery, and two or three shook hands, and others went out chewing the fragments of herb they had taken from the sweet herbs lying about.He went last of all, because of having to be helped from his chair and to go very slowly; and he held my hand while all the others were removed, and while the audience got up (putting their dresses right, as they might at church or elsewhere) and pointed down at this criminal or at that, and most of all at him and me."
"我诚心希望并且祈祷，他最好在庭审记录公布之前就离世。不过，我担心他这样半死不活的还要一段时间。于是我当晚就着手给内务大臣写请愿书，详细陈述我对马格维奇的了解，以及他是为了我而回国的事实。我把这封请愿书写得尽可能诚挚、尽可能悲怆。写完寄出之后，我又写给其他我认为心肠最为慈悲的当局要员，甚至还写了一封给国王陛下。在他判死刑后的一连好几个日日夜夜，我都没有休息，除了有几次在椅子上睡着了之外，其他时候我全都在想这些请愿书的事。自从我投递了这些请愿书之后，我就没法离开那些投信的地方，我觉得只要我离它们近一些，它们就更有希望一些，不会那么令人绝望。莫名的不安和痛苦的思绪纠缠着我，在这样的情况下，我会在黄昏时分上街闲逛，在我投了请愿书的那些办公大楼旁边徘徊。即使在今天，只要一想起那尘土飞扬的寒冷春夜，想起伦敦那令人烦闷的西街区，街上那一排排庄严肃穆、大门紧锁的宅邸，还有那长长的、一字排开的街灯，一阵愁绪还是会涌上我的心头。","I earnestly hoped and prayed that he might die before the Recorder’s Report was made, but, in the dread of his lingering on, I began that night to write out a petition to the Home Secretary of State, setting forth my knowledge of him, and how it was that he had come back for my sake.I wrote it as fervently and pathetically as I could, and when I had finished it and sent it in, I wrote out other petitions to such men in authority as I hoped were the most merciful, and drew up one to the Crown itself.For several days and nights after he was sentenced I took no rest except when I fell asleep in my chair, but was wholly absorbed in these appeals.And after I had sent them in, I could not keep away from the places where they were, but felt as if they were more hopeful and less desperate when I was near them.In this unreasonable restlessness and pain of mind, I would roam the streets of an evening, wandering by those offices and houses where I had left the petitions.To the present hour, the weary western streets of London on a cold dusty spring night, with their ranges of stern shut-up mansions and their long rows of lamps, are melancholy to me from this association."
"我每天都去看他，但现在允许探监的时间缩短了，他也被看管得更严了。我看得出，也可能是我的幻想，他们怀疑我会带毒药进去把他毒死。所以我要求他们先搜我的身，再让我坐到他身边。我对一直在那里看管他的狱吏说，只要他相信我只是来探监的，没有别的意图，我愿意为他做任何事情。没有人找他的麻烦，也没有人找我的麻烦。他们只是在做自己的本职工作，执行起来却并不严厉。狱吏每次都对我说，他的身体状况更糟糕了，同室的其他一些病人，还有其他一些派来照顾这些病人的犯人们（他们虽是罪人，但不是没有慈悲之心的，感谢在天之主！），也常常告诉我同样的消息。","The daily visits I could make him were shortened now, and he was more strictly kept.Seeing, or fancying, that I was suspected of an intention of carrying poison to him, I asked to be searched before I sat down at his bedside, and told the officer who was always there, that I was willing to do anything that would assure him of the singleness of my designs.Nobody was hard with him, or with me.There was duty to be done, and it was done, but not harshly.The officer always gave me the assurance that he was worse, and some other sick prisoners in the room, and some other prisoners who attended on them as sick nurses (malefactors, but not incapable of kindness, God be thanked!), always joined in the same report."
"随着时间的推移，我注意到他越来越多的时候是平静地躺在床上，两眼盯着白色的天花板，脸上毫无光彩，直到我说了一些话，他的脸上才突然闪现出一道光彩，然后又很快就消失了。有时他几乎或者完全说不了话，这时，他就会轻轻按一下我的手作为回答，慢慢地我也能很好地领会他的意思了。","As the days went on, I noticed more and more that he would lie placidly looking at the white ceiling, with an absence of light in his face, until some word of mine brightened it for an instant, and then it would subside again.Sometimes he was almost, or quite, unable to speak; then, he would answer me with slight pressures on my hand, and I grew to understand his meaning very well."
"到了第十天的时候，我发现他有了很大的变化，这是我之前没有见过的。我一进来，他的眼睛就朝门口望去，整个人也兴奋了起来。","The number of the days had risen to ten, when I saw a greater change in him than I had seen yet.His eyes were turned towards the door, and lighted up as I entered."
"“好孩子，”我在他床边坐下后，他对我说，“我以为你今天要晚些才能来。不过我知道你不会晚的。”","“Dear boy,” he said, as I sat down by his bed: “I thought you was late.But I knowed you couldn’t be that.”"
"“我来的正准时，”我说，“我在门口等时间到了才进来的。”","“It is just the time,” said I.“I waited for it at the gate.”"
"“你总是在门口等着，是吗，好孩子？”","“You always waits at the gate; don’t you, dear boy?”"
"“是的。我一分钟也不能浪费。”","“Yes.Not to lose a moment of the time.”"
"“谢谢你，好孩子，谢谢你。上帝保佑你！你从来没丢下我，好孩子。”","“Thank’ee dear boy, thank’ee.God bless you!You’ve never deserted me, dear boy.”"
"我没有说话，只是按了一下他的手，因为我记得我曾经有过丢下他的想法。","I pressed his hand in silence, for I could not forget that I had once meant to desert him."
"“最好的事情是，”他说，“自从我被一团乌云笼罩以来，你一直陪着我，这比红日照在我头上的时候更让我觉得舒服。这是最好的事情。”","“And what’s the best of all,” he said, “you’ve been more comfortable alonger me, since I was under a dark cloud, than when the sun shone.That’s best of all.”"
"他平躺在床上，呼吸十分困难。虽然他很爱我，也尽力想支撑住病体，但他脸上的光彩总是不时地就消散了，一层薄薄的阴影笼罩在他那张面对白色天花板的、平静的脸上。","He lay on his back, breathing with great difficulty.Do what he would, and love me though he did, the light left his face ever and again, and a film came over the placid look at the white ceiling."
"“你今天很疼吗？”","“Are you in much pain today?”"
"“我不会喊疼的，好孩子。”","“I don’t complain of none, dear boy.”"
"“你从来都不喊疼。”","“You never do complain.”"
"他说完了最后的话。他对我笑了，用手碰了我一下，我明白他的意思，他是想抬起我的手，放到他的胸口上。我把手放到了他的胸口，他又笑了，把他的双手放在了我的手上。","He had spoken his last words.He smiled, and I understood his touch to mean that he wished to lift my hand, and lay it on his breast.I laid it there, and he smiled again, and put both his hands upon it."
"这时，允许探监的时间快到了，我环视了一下，发现狱长站在离我不远的地方，他小声对我说：“你不用急着走。”我满怀感激地谢过他，问了一句：“如果他还能听见我说话，我可以跟他说几句吗？”","The allotted time ran out, while we were thus; but, looking round, I found the governor of the prison standing near me, and he whispered, “You needn’t go yet.”I thanked him gratefully, and asked, “Might I speak to him, if he can hear me?”"
"狱长于是退到一边，并且示意看守也离开。虽然我们做这些事的时候是无声无息的，但笼罩在他凝视白色天花板的、平静的脸上的那层薄薄的阴影已经消散了，他无比深情地看着我。","The governor stepped aside, and beckoned the officer away.The change, though it was made without noise, drew back the film from the placid look at the white ceiling, and he looked most affectionately at me."
"“亲爱的马格维奇，有一件事我必须告诉你，我最终还是要说出来。你能听懂我的话吗？”","“Dear Magwitch, I must tell you, now at last.You understand what I say?”"
"他在我手上轻轻按了一下。","A gentle pressure on my hand."
"“你有过一个孩子，你爱她，但你失去了她。”","“You had a child once, whom you loved and lost.”"
"他又在我手上按了一下，比刚才重了。","A stronger pressure on my hand."
"“她还活着，和有权势的朋友来往。她还在这世上。她是个淑女，而且非常美丽。而且我爱她！”","“She lived and found powerful friends.She is living now.She is a lady and very beautiful.And I love her!”"
"他使尽了最后一点微弱的力气，想把我的手抬到他的嘴边，但他已经没有力气了，我于是顺他的意，把手放到他的嘴边。然后，他轻轻地让我的手滑向他的胸口，又把他的双手放到我的手上。我又看见了他脸上那种凝视着白色天花板的、平静的神情一闪而逝，他的头悄无声息地垂到了胸前。","With a last faint effort, which would have been powerless but for my yielding to it and assisting it, he raised my hand to his lips.Then, he gently let it sink upon his breast again, with his own hands lying on it.The placid look at the white ceiling came back, and passed away, and his head dropped quietly on his breast."
"这时，我想起了我曾经给他读过的书，想起了书上说有两个人到殿里去祷告，我知道此刻在他的床边，除了一句话，我想不出更适合的了，那就是：“噢，上帝，宽恕这个罪人吧！”","Mindful, then, of what we had read together, I thought of the two men who went up into the Temple to pray, and I knew there were no better words that I could say beside his bed, than “O Lord, be merciful to him, a sinner!”"
"第五十七章","Chapter 57"
"现在就只剩下我一个人了，我告诉房东，我打算等租赁期一满，就把坦普尔的房子退掉，同时想办法把房子转租出去。我立刻在窗上贴上招租广告，此时的我债务缠身，几乎身无分文，如此的境地让我开始惊慌了。或许我该这么写，如果我还有足够的精力让我清楚地意识到这一点的话，我本应该惊慌的，而当时我除了发现自己病得很重之外，什么也没有意识到。最近袭来的压力使我的病推迟发作，但并+B10没有驱散病魔，我知道病魔现在开始向我进攻了，其他的我就不知道了，甚至也没有在意。","Now that I was left wholly to myself, I gave notice of my intention to quit the chambers in the Temple as soon as my tenancy could legally determine, and in the meanwhile to underlet them.At once I put bills up in the windows; for, I was in debt, and had scarcely any money, and began to be seriously alarmed by the state of my affairs.I ought rather to write that I should have been alarmed if I had had energy and concentration enough to help me to the clear perception of any truth beyond the fact that I was falling very ill.The late stress upon me had enabled me to put off illness, but not to put it away; I knew that it was coming on me now, and I knew very little else, and was even careless as to that."
"开始的一两天，我躺在沙发上，或者地板上——或者其他什么地方，我碰巧在哪里坐下就在哪里躺下了——只觉得头昏脑胀、四肢疼痛、毫无目的、毫无气力。有一天晚上我感觉格外漫长，满是焦虑和恐惧。第二天早上我试着从床上坐起来，想想晚上发生了什么，结果发现我起不来了。","For a day or two, I lay on the sofa, or on the floor—anywhere, according as I happened to sink down—with a heavy head and aching limbs, and no purpose, and no power.Then there came one night which appeared of great duration, and which teemed with anxiety and horror; and when in the morning I tried to sit up in my bed and think of it, I found I could not do so."
"我究竟有没有深更半夜走到花园坊去，摸索那个我以为系着船的地方；究竟有没有那么两三次，我在楼梯上惊恐万分地苏醒过来，不知自己是怎么下的床；我究竟有没有想到他正在上楼，而楼道里的灯都熄灭了，于是出去点灯；我究竟有没有为一个人的说话声、笑声和呻吟声感到说不出的心烦意乱，而又有点怀疑这些声音都是我自己发出来的；在这间屋子某个黑暗的角落里，究竟有没有一个封闭的铁制火炉，究竟有没有一个声音一遍又一遍地喊着，郝维仙小姐要被火烧死了——那天早上我就躺在床上，试着把这些事情想想清楚、理理顺。可是，石灰窑的烟雾总是弥漫在我和这些事情中间，把它们全都打乱了，最后在这片烟雾中，我看见有两个人正看着我。","Whether I really had been down in Garden Court in the dead of the night, groping about for the boat that I supposed to be there; whether I had two or three times come to myself on the staircase with great terror, not knowing how I had got out of bed; whether I had found myself lighting the lamp, possessed by the idea that he was coming up the stairs, and that the lights were blown out; whether I had been inexpressibly harassed by the distracted talking, laughing, and groaning, of some one, and had half suspected those sounds to be of my own making; whether there had been a closed iron furnace in a dark corner of the room, and a voice had called out over and over again that Miss Havisham was consuming within it; these were things that I tried to settle with myself and get into some order, as I lay that morning on my bed.But, the vapor of a limekiln would come between me and them, disordering them all, and it was through the vapor at last that I saw two men looking at me."
"“你们要干什么？”我惊讶地问道，“我不认识你们。”","“What do you want?” I asked, starting; “I don’t know you.”"
"“嗯，先生，”他们中的一个弯下腰拍着我的肩膀说，“有件事情你会尽快去处理的，我敢说，不过你被逮捕了。”","“Well, sir,” returned one of them, bending down and touching me on the shoulder, “this is a matter that you’ll soon arrange, I dare say, but you’re arrested.”"
"“我欠了多少债？”","“What is the debt?”"
"“一百二十三磅十五先令六便士。我想，这个是你欠珠宝商的账款。”","“Hundred and twenty-three pound, fifteen, six.Jeweler’s account, I think.”"
"“我要做什么呢？”","“What is to be done?”"
"“你最好到我家里去一趟，”那个人说，“我家里收拾得非常整洁。”","“You had better come to my house,” said the man.“I keep a very nice house.”"
"我试图从床上起来穿衣。我再看他们的时候，他们已经站到了离床远一些的地方，正看着我。我仍然躺着没有动。","I made some attempt to get up and dress myself.When I next attended to them, they were standing a little off from the bed, looking at me.I still lay there."
"“你们看到我现在的状况了吧，”我说，“如果我可以的话，我就跟你们走了，可我确实没办法。如果你们要把我从这里带走，我想我半路上就没命了。”","“You see my state,” said I.“I would come with you if I could; but indeed I am quite unable.If you take me from here, I think I shall die by the way.”"
"他们可能答了几句，可能争辩了一下，也可能试图鼓励我，让我相信我的状况并没有我想象的那么糟。由于他们在我的记忆中只留下了这么一点微薄的印象，我不知道他们后来又做了什么，只知道他们最终还是没有带我走。","Perhaps they replied, or argued the point, or tried to encourage me to believe that I was better than I thought.For as much as they hang in my memory by only this one slender thread, I don’t know what they did, except that they forbore to remove me."
"我发烧了，来的人都因此离开了。我痛苦不堪，好几次都发现自己没法思考，时间好像没有尽头。我觉得自己成了各种物体，但又觉得不现实，把自己搞糊涂了。我觉得自己是墙上的一块砖，被泥瓦匠砌了进去，我恳求他们把我从这头昏目眩的地方解救出来。我又成了一台巨大的机器上的一根钢梁，在一个深渊上方撞击着、旋转着，我乞求他们把机器关掉，把我这一部分用锤截断。我在病中经受了这些，这些是我现在能记起来的，也是当时稍微能记起的一部分。有时候真的有人来，我以为他们是来杀我的，于是和他们搏斗起来，突然间明白他们并无恶意，于是精疲力尽地倒在他们的怀抱中，让他们扶着我躺下，这些也是我当时能记起的。不过，最重要的是，我知道这些人的模样总有一种不断变化的趋势——在我病得厉害的时候，他们的脸变成了各种各样奇怪的样子，甚至膨胀、+B44变大——不过，我要说的是，我知道这些人的样子不管变得多么古怪，最终都会化成一个人的形象，那就是乔。","That I had a fever and was avoided, that I suffered greatly, that I often lost my reason, that the time seemed interminable, that I confounded impossible existences with my own identity; that I was a brick in the house wall, and yet entreating to be released from the giddy place where the builders had set me; that I was a steel beam of a vast engine, clashing and whirling over a gulf, and yet that I implored in my own person to have the engine stopped, and my part in it hammered off; that I passed through these phases of disease, I know of my own remembrance, and did in some sort know at the time.That I sometimes struggled with real people, in the belief that they were murderers, and that I would all at once comprehend that they meant to do me good, and would then sink exhausted in their arms, and suffer them to lay me down, I also knew at the time.But, above all, I knew that there was a constant tendency in all these people—who, when I was very ill, would present all kinds of extraordinary transformations of the human face, and would be much dilated in size—above all, I say, I knew that there was an extraordinary tendency in all these people, sooner or later to settle down into the likeness of Joe."
"我病情最危急的时候过去之后，我开始注意到，其他各种奇奇怪怪的面孔都变了，唯有这张面孔始终不变。不管靠近我的人是谁，最后都会变成乔的样子。夜里我睁开眼睛，看见床边那把大椅子里坐着一个人，我觉得他是乔。白天我睁开眼睛，看见窗台下坐着一个人，在打开的窗子的阴影里抽烟，我觉得他是乔。我要喝清凉饮料，一双亲切的手把饮料递给我，我觉得那是乔的手。喝完之后我把头靠回枕头上，一张满怀希望和温情的脸看着我，我觉得那是乔的脸。","After I had turned the worst point of my illness, I began to notice that while all its other features changed, this one consistent feature did not change.Whoever came about me, still settled down into Joe.I opened my eyes in the night, and I saw in the great chair at the bedside, Joe.I opened my eyes in the day, and, sitting on the window-seat, smoking his pipe in the shaded open window, still I saw Joe.I asked for cooling drink, and the dear hand that gave it me was Joe’s.I sank back on my pillow after drinking, and the face that looked so hopefully and tenderly upon me was the face of Joe."
"终于有一天，我鼓起勇气问了句：“你是乔吗？”","At last, one day, I took courage, and said, “Is it Joe?”"
"那个人用亲切的乡音回答我：“是啊，老弟。”","And the dear old home-voice answered, “Which it air, old chap.”"
"“噢，乔，把我的心砸碎吧！对我发火吧，乔。打我吧，乔。你骂我忘恩负义吧。不要对我这么好！”","“O Joe, you break my heart!Look angry at me, Joe.Strike me, Joe.Tell me of my ingratitude.Don’t be so good to me!”"
"乔看到我认出了他，高兴地把头靠在我的枕边，伸出一只胳膊搂着我的脖子。","For, Joe had actually laid his head down on the pillow at my side and put his arm round my neck, in his joy that I knew him."
"“亲爱的皮普老弟，”乔说，“你和我永远都是朋友。等你的病好了，我们一起乘车出去走走——那多好啊！”","“Which dear old Pip, old chap,” said Joe, “you and me was ever friends.And when you’re well enough to go out for a ride—what larks!”"
"说完之后，乔向窗边走去，背对着我站在那里，用手擦着眼睛。由于我身子十分虚弱，没法起身走到他那里去，我只能躺在床上，带着忏悔的口吻喃喃低语：“上帝保佑他吧！上帝保佑这位温和的基督徒吧！”","After which, Joe withdrew to the window, and stood with his back towards me, wiping his eyes.And as my extreme weakness prevented me from getting up and going to him, I lay there, penitently whispering, “O God bless him!O God bless this gentle Christian man!”"
"乔坐回我身边时，我发现他的眼睛红了，不过，我握着他的手，我们都沉浸在幸福中。","Joe’s eyes were red when I next found him beside me; but, I was holding his hand, and we both felt happy."
"“多长时间了，亲爱的乔？”","“How long, dear Joe?”"
"“你的意思是你病了多久了吗，皮普，亲爱的老弟？”","“Which you meantersay, Pip, how long have your illness lasted, dear old chap?”"
"“是的，乔。”","“Yes, Joe.”"
"“今天是五月的最后一天，皮普。明天就是六月的第一天了。”","“It’s the end of May, Pip.Tomorrow is the first of June.”"
"“你一直在这里吗，亲爱的乔？”","“And have you been here all that time, dear Joe?”"
"“差不多吧，老弟。我收到信得知你病了，就跟比迪说了。信是一位邮差送来的，这个人原先是个单身汉，现在结婚了，虽然送信的活要走很多路，还要费很多双皮鞋，不过发财不是他最大的心愿，他最大的心愿是结婚——”","“Pretty nigh, old chap.For, as I says to Biddy when the news of your being ill were brought by letter, which it were brought by the post and being formerly single he is now married though underpaid for a deal of walking and shoe-leather, but wealth were not a object on his part, and marriage were the great wish of his hart—”"
"“听你这么说我真高兴，乔！不过我得打断你的话，我想知道你是怎么跟比迪说的。”","“It is so delightful to hear you, Joe!But I interrupt you in what you said to Biddy.”"
"“我是这么说的，”乔说，“我说你平时可能都和陌生人打交道，而你和我是老朋友，我在这个时候去看你，不会不受欢迎的。比迪听了后说，‘去看他吧，不要浪费时间。’”乔带着一种明断的神情总结了一遍，“这就是比迪的原话。‘去看他吧，’比迪说，‘不要浪费时间。’总之，”乔一脸严肃地想了想，补充了一句，“如果我对你说，那位年轻的女士说的是，‘一分钟的时间也不要浪费’，那我告诉你的和她的原话也差不离。”","“Which it were,” said Joe, “that how you might be amongst strangers, and that how you and me having been ever friends, a wisit at such a moment might not prove unacceptabobble.And Biddy, her word were, ‘Go to him, without loss of time.’That,” said Joe, summing up with his judicial air, “were the word of Biddy.‘Go to him,’ Biddy say, ‘without loss of time.’In short, I shouldn’t greatly deceive you,” Joe added, after a little grave reflection, “if I represented to you that the word of that young woman were, ‘without a minute’s loss of time.’”"
"乔就此打住了，告诉我不要说太多的话，要定时补充一些营养，不管我愿不愿意，而且我得一切听从他的安排。于是，我亲了亲他的手，轻轻地躺下了，他便去给比迪写信，还在信中附上我对她的问候。","There Joe cut himself short, and informed me that I was to be talked to in great moderation, and that I was to take a little nourishment at stated frequent times, whether I felt inclined for it or not, and that I was to submit myself to all his orders.So, I kissed his hand, and lay quiet, while he proceeded to indite a note to Biddy, with my love in it."
"显然，比迪已经教会乔写信了。我躺在床上看着他，本来身子就虚弱，看着他提笔写信那自豪的样子，我高兴得又一次哭了。我床上的帐子拆下来了，乔把我连人带床一起搬到了起居室，因为那里空气流通最好，也最宽敞，地毯也撤掉了，房间从早到晚都是清清爽爽、干干净净的。我的写字台被推到了一个角落里，上面堆满了瓶瓶罐罐。乔在我的写字台前坐下了，开始了他伟大的工作。他首先从笔筒里挑了一只笔，好像笔筒里装的是粗大的工具一样，然后卷起袖子，好像要挥舞一根撬棍或者一把铁锤一样。乔动笔前，必须先把左胳膊重重地压在桌上，再把右腿伸到椅子后面，然后才能开始写信。等他开始写了，他每一笔向下的笔画都很慢，好像能拉六英尺长，而每写一个向上的笔画时，我都能听见他墨水从他的笔尖喷溅而出的声音。奇怪的是，他总以为墨水瓶在他的这一边，而实际上是在另一边，所以他手上的笔总是蘸了个空，而他看起来却好像对这样的结果很满意。有时，他会被某个词的拼法难住，不过总体来说写得很顺利。他最后签好名，用两手的食指擦掉纸上最后一点墨渍，又把墨渍擦到帽子上去了。他站起身，绕着桌子走来走去，带着无比满足的神情从各个角度欣赏摆在桌上的作品。","Evidently, Biddy had taught Joe to write.As I lay in bed looking at him, it made me, in my weak state, cry again with pleasure to see the pride with which he set about his letter.My bedstead, divested of its curtains, had been removed, with me upon it, into the sitting room, as the airiest and largest, and the carpet had been taken away, and the room kept always fresh and wholesome night and day.At my own writing-table, pushed into a corner and cumbered with little bottles, Joe now sat down to his great work, first choosing a pen from the pen-tray as if it were a chest of large tools, and tucking up his sleeves as if he were going to wield a crowbar or sledgehammer.It was necessary for Joe to hold on heavily to the table with his left elbow, and to get his right leg well out behind him, before he could begin, and when he did begin, he made every down-stroke so slowly that it might have been six feet long, while at every up-stroke I could hear his pen spluttering extensively.He had a curious idea that the inkstand was on the side of him where it was not, and constantly dipped his pen into space, and seemed quite satisfied with the result.Occasionally, he was tripped up by some orthographical stumbling-block, but on the whole he got on very well indeed, and when he had signed his name, and had removed a finishing blot from the paper to the crown of his head with his two forefingers, he got up and hovered about the table, trying the effect of his performance from various points of view as it lay there, with unbounded satisfaction."
"即使我已经可以多说话了，我也不想说太多话让乔担心。于是我一直等到第二天才向他打听郝维仙小姐的事。我问他，她是不是已经康复了，他摇了摇头。","Not to make Joe uneasy by talking too much, even if I had been able to talk much, I deferred asking him about Miss Havisham until next day.He shook his head when I then asked him if she had recovered."
"“她死了吗，乔？”","“Is she dead, Joe?”"
"“你看，老弟，”乔带着一种劝告的口气，用一种渐进的方式说，“我不想那样说，那样说语气太重了，不过，她已经不——”","“Why you see, old chap,” said Joe, in a tone of remonstrance, and by way of getting at it by degrees, “I wouldn’t go so far as to say that, for that’s a deal to say; but she ain’t—”"
"“不在世了吗，乔？”","“Living, Joe?”"
"“差不多这个意思，”乔说，“她已经不在世了。”","“That’s nigher where it is,” said Joe; “she ain’t living.”"
"“她的病拖了很久吗，乔？”","“Did she linger long, Joe?”"
"“在你病了之后，你也许会说一个星期吧（如果你这么说），将近这么长的时间。”乔说，他是为了我才什么事都用渐进的方式说。","“Arter you was took ill, pretty much about what you might call (if you was put to it) a week,” said Joe; still determined, on my account, to come at everything by degrees."
"“亲爱的乔，你有没有听说，她的财产是怎么处理的？”","“Dear Joe, have you heard what becomes of her property?”"
"“哦，老弟，”乔说，“看来她把大部分遗产留给了埃斯特拉小姐，我的意思是这是她早就决定了的。不过她在去世前一两天亲手追加了一条，留给马修·鄱凯特先生整整四千英镑。最重要的是，皮普，你知道她为什么留给他整整四千英镑吗？‘因为皮普对马修的评价’。这是比迪告诉我的，比迪说她就是这样写的，”乔说，然后重复了一遍这句话，好像这对他有莫大的好处似的，“‘对马修的评价。’整整四千英镑呐，皮普！”","“Well, old chap,” said Joe, “it do appear that she had settled the most of it, which I meantersay tied it up, on Miss Estella.But she had wrote out a little coddleshell in her own hand a day or two afore the accident, leaving a cool four thousand to Mr. Matthew Pocket.And why, do you suppose, above all things, Pip, she left that cool four thousand unto him?‘Because of Pip’s account of him the said Matthew.’I am told by Biddy, that air the writing,” said Joe, repeating the legal turn as if it did him infinite good, ‘account of him the said Matthew.’And a cool four thousand, Pip!”"
"我不知道乔是从谁那里得到对四千英镑这一概念的惯常理解的，不过他显然津津乐道于“整整”这个词，似乎对他来说，这么一说这笔钱听起来数目更大了。","I never discovered from whom Joe derived the conventional temperature of the four thousand pounds, but it appeared to make the sum of money more to him, and he had a manifest relish in insisting on its being cool."
"听他这么一说，我高兴极了，因为这是我做过的唯一一件好事，如今算是大功告成了。我问乔他有没有听说，郝维仙小姐的其他亲戚当中有没有人得到遗产？","This account gave me great joy, as it perfected the only good thing I had done.I asked Joe whether he had heard if any of the other relations had any legacies?"
"“萨拉小姐，”乔说，“她每年可得二十五英镑，因为她胆汁太多、脾气太暴躁，这钱是给她买药的。乔治亚娜小姐，她得了二十英镑。还有一位叫什么的夫人——有一种背部隆起的野生动物叫什么来着，老弟？”","“Miss Sarah,” said Joe, “she have twenty-five pound perannium fur to buy pills, on account of being bilious.Miss Georgiana, she have twenty pound down.Mrs.—what’s the name of them wild beasts with humps, old chap?”"
"“骆驼吗？”我说，不知道他为什么想知道这个。","“Camels?” said I, wondering why he could possibly want to know."
"乔点了点头，说道：“卡梅尔夫人，”这时我才意识到他指的是卡米拉，“她得了五英镑，给她买灯芯草蜡烛用，这样她夜里醒来情绪能好些。”（注：“卡梅尔”和“骆驼”在英语中发音相近）","Joe nodded.“Mrs. Camels,” by which I presently understood he meant Camilla, “she have five pound fur to buy rushlights to put her in spirits when she wake up in the night.”"
"乔一五一十说得很清楚，这足以让我相信，他的信息绝对可靠。“现在，”乔说，“你身体还没恢复呢，老弟，我今天再告诉你一件事，就这一件。老奥立克闯进别人家里去了。”","The accuracy of these recitals was sufficiently obvious to me, to give me great confidence in Joe’s information.“And now,” said Joe, “you ain’t that strong yet, old chap, that you can take in more nor one additional shovel-full today.Old Orlick he’s been a bustin’ open a dwelling-ouse.”"
"“谁家？”我问。","“Whose?” said I."
"“我跟你说，他就是粗鲁成性。”乔带着歉意说，“可是，一个英国人的家就是他的堡垒，堡垒是不能闯入的，除非是在战争年代。再说了，就算他有什么缺点，人家好歹也是谷物和种子商吧。”","“Not, I grant, you, but what his manners is given to blusterous,” said Joe, apologetically; “still, a Englishman’s ouse is his Castle, and castles must not be busted ’cept when done in war time.And wotsume’er the failings on his part, he were a corn and seedsman in his hart.”"
"“这么说，他闯了彭波契克的家了？”","“Is it Pumblechook’s house that has been broken into, then?”"
"“是的，皮普。”乔说，“他们砸了他的抽屉，抢了他的钱箱，喝了他的酒，吃了他的东西，还抽他耳光，拔他鼻子，又把他绑在床柱子上，打了他一顿，还在他嘴里塞满开花的一年生植物，不让他喊出来。不过他认出了奥立克，自然奥立克就被关进了郡里的牢房。”","“That’s it, Pip,” said Joe; “and they took his till, and they took his cash-box, and they drinked his wine, and they partook of his wittles, and they slapped his face, and they pulled his nose, and they tied him up to his bedpust, and they giv’ him a dozen, and they stuffed his mouth full of flowering annuals to prewent his crying out.But he knowed Orlick, and Orlick’s in the county jail.”"
"谈到了这些，我们随后就无所不谈了。我力气恢复得很慢，但我确实是在逐渐好转。乔陪在我身边，我觉得自己又成了当年那个小皮普。","By these approaches we arrived at unrestricted conversation.I was slow to gain strength, but I did slowly and surely become less weak, and Joe stayed with me, and I fancied I was little Pip again."
"因为，乔对我体贴入微、呵护备至，我就像一个被他照顾的小孩子。他坐着和我说话，依旧那么自如，依旧那么纯朴，依旧用那种谦虚的、想要保护我的方式，以至于我几乎相信自从我离开故居的厨房以来，我的生活就像发了一场高烧，导致我神志不清，好在烧已经退了。他除了家务活，什么事都为我做。他一来就把那个洗衣妇打发走了，请了一位十分像样的妇女来接替她。“你要相信我，皮普。”他对我说过好几次，他未经过我同意就这么做是有理由的，“我看见她拍那张备用的床，把拍松的鸭绒拨出来装进桶里，再拿去卖掉。她下一次就要来拍你这张床了，就算你躺在上面，也能把你床上的鸭绒拔走，然后用你的汤盘把煤屑一点一点运走，再把葡萄酒和烈性酒装在你的惠灵顿长靴里带走。”","For, the tenderness of Joe was so beautifully proportioned to my need, that I was like a child in his hands.He would sit and talk to me in the old confidence, and with the old simplicity, and in the old unassertive protecting way, so that I would half believe that all my life since the days of the old kitchen was one of the mental troubles of the fever that was gone.He did everything for me except the household work, for which he had engaged a very decent woman, after paying off the laundress on his first arrival.“Which I do assure you, Pip,” he would often say, in explanation of that liberty; “I found her a tapping the spare bed, like a cask of beer, and drawing off the feathers in a bucket, for sale.Which she would have tapped yourn next, and draw’d it off with you a laying on it, and was then a carrying away the coals gradiwally in the souptureen and wegetable-dishes, and the wine and spirits in your Wellington boots.”"
"我们盼着一起乘车外出的那一天的到来，我当他学徒的时候，也曾这样期盼过那一天的到来。这一天果然来了，一辆敞篷马车开进了巷子里。乔把我裹好，抱起我，一直抱到马车前，然后把我放进车里，好像我还是那个无助的小家伙，他那伟大的天性把一切都给了我。","We looked forward to the day when I should go out for a ride, as we had once looked forward to the day of my apprenticeship.And when the day came, and an open carriage was got into the Lane, Joe wrapped me up, took me in his arms, carried me down to it, and put me in, as if I were still the small helpless creature to whom he had so abundantly given of the wealth of his great nature."
"乔进了马车，在我身边坐下了。马车载着我们朝乡间驶去，两旁树木繁茂、绿草如茵，眼前呈现出夏天的色彩，空气中弥漫着夏日的香气。这天正好是星期天，我望着四周秀丽的风景，想着这些草木是如何生长和变化的，这些小小的野花又是如何绽放的。鸟儿一个劲地唱着，不分白昼黑夜，不管头顶上是太阳的光芒还是星星的清辉，而可怜的我躺在床上，发着高烧，辗转反侧，只要一想起我发着烧在床上辗转发侧的情景，我的心情就无法平静。可是，当礼拜日的钟声传入耳畔，当我朝四周无边的美景再次张望，我感到，我内心虽然愉快——但我实在太虚弱了，没有力气了——我把头靠在乔的肩膀上，就像孩提时他带我去集市或其他什么地方一样——那些盛况对我幼稚的感官来说一下子消化不了。","And Joe got in beside me, and we drove away together into the country, where the rich summer growth was already on the trees and on the grass, and sweet summer scents filled all the air.The day happened to be Sunday, and when I looked on the loveliness around me, and thought how it had grown and changed, and how the little wild flowers had been forming, and the voices of the birds had been strengthening, by day and by night, under the sun and under the stars, while poor I lay burning and tossing on my bed, the mere remembrance of having burned and tossed there, came like a check upon my peace.But, when I heard the Sunday bells, and looked around a little more upon the outspread beauty, I felt that I was not nearly thankful enough—that I was too weak yet, to be even that—and I laid my head on Joe’s shoulder, as I had laid it long ago when he had taken me to the Fair or where not, and it was too much for my young senses."
"过了一会儿，我那颗被扰乱的心恢复了平静。我们躺在古炮台旁的草地上，像往日那样交谈。乔依然是当年的乔，一点也没有变。他当年在我眼里是什么样子，现在还是什么样子，还是那么忠实，还是那么正直。","More composure came to me after a while, and we talked as we used to talk, lying on the grass at the old Battery.There was no change whatever in Joe.Exactly what he had been in my eyes then, he was in my eyes still; just as simply faithful, and as simply right."
"我们回去的时候，他把我抱出马车，他抱着我——对他来说这是轻而易举的事——穿过花园坊，上了楼梯，我想起了那个非同寻常的圣诞节，他背着我去沼泽地的情景。关于我财产上的变故，我们谁都没有提及，我也不清楚他对我近来的事情知道了多少。我现在对自己极度怀疑，对他则是十分信任，我不知道该不该提这件事，既然他还没有提到。","When we got back again and he lifted me out, and carried me—so easily—across the court and up the stairs, I thought of that eventful Christmas Day when he had carried me over the marshes.We had not yet made any allusion to my change of fortune, nor did I know how much of my late history he was acquainted with.I was so doubtful of myself now, and put so much trust in him, that I could not satisfy myself whether I ought to refer to it when he did not."
"“乔，你有没有听说过，”那天晚上趁着他在窗口抽烟，我经过充分的考虑之后问他，“我的恩主是谁？”","“Have you heard, Joe,” I asked him that evening, upon further consideration, as he smoked his pipe at the window, “who my patron was?”"
"“我听说了，”乔说，“听说不是郝维仙小姐，老弟。”","“I heerd,” returned Joe, “as it were not Miss Havisham, old chap.”"
"“你听说是谁了吗，乔？”","“Did you hear who it was, Joe?”"
"“嗯！我听说是那个派人到‘三个快活船员’酒馆送钞票给你的人，皮普。”","“Well! I heerd as it were a person what sent the person what giv’ you the bank-notes at the Jolly Bargemen, Pip.”"
"“正是他。”","“So it was.”"
"“真让人吃惊！”乔说，语气却显得很平静。","“Astonishing!” said Joe, in the placidest way."
"“你听说他已经死了吗，乔？”我接着问道，心里越来越没底了。","“Did you hear that he was dead, Joe?” I presently asked, with increasing diffidence."
"“谁？那个派人送钞票给你的人吗，皮普？”","“Which?Him as sent the bank-notes, Pip?”"
"“是的。”","“Yes.”"
"“我想，”乔沉思了好一阵子，似乎是在躲避我的眼光，他望着靠窗的椅子，说道，“我听人说过，但只大概听说他是个这样或那样的人。”","“I think,” said Joe, after meditating a long time, and looking rather evasively at the window-seat, “as I did hear tell that how he were something or another in a general way in that direction.”"
"“你听说过他的境况吗，乔？”","“Did you hear anything of his circumstances, Joe?”"
"“具体情况倒没有听说，皮普。”","“Not partickler, Pip.”"
"“如果你愿意听的话，乔——”我正要开始说，乔站起身向我坐的沙发走来。","“If you would like to hear, Joe—” I was beginning, when Joe got up and came to my sofa."
"“看你说的，老弟。”乔俯身对我说，“我们永远都是最好的朋友，不是吗，皮普？”","“Lookee here, old chap,” said Joe, bending over me.“Ever the best of friends; ain’t us, Pip?”"
"我羞愧得无言以对。","I was ashamed to answer him."
"“很好，”乔说，好像我已经回答了他一样，“这样就行了，我们意见一致了。那么，我们为什么还要去谈没有必要谈论的话题呢，老弟？我们还有很多可以谈论的话题，没必要的就别再谈论了。天啊！想想你那可怜的姐姐，还有她的暴躁脾气！你不记得那根挠痒棍了吗？”","“Wery good, then,” said Joe, as if I had answered; “that’s all right, that’s agreed upon.Then why go into subjects, old chap, which as betwixt two sech must be for ever onnecessary?There’s subjects enough as betwixt two sech, without onnecessary ones.Lord!To think of your poor sister and her Rampages!And don’t you remember Tickler?”"
"“我记得，乔。”","“I do indeed, Joe.”"
"“听我说，老弟，”乔说，“我尽量不让挠痒棍打到你身上，可我总是心有余而力不足。每当你那可怜的姐姐下定决心要打你一顿时，”乔用他喜欢的争辩的语气说，“要是我挡上去不让她打，她不光连我一起打，而且还会因此打你打得更重了。我注意到了这一点。她抓那个男人的胡子，摇他的身子（你姐姐很喜欢用这招），但那个人不会因为这样就不去保护一个小孩子，让他免受惩罚。可是那个小孩子也卷了进来，不让她抓他的胡子，摇他的身子，这样一来这个小孩子反而被打得更厉害了，于是他对自己说，‘你这么做有什么好处呢？我看你这么做只有坏处。’他说，‘一点好处也没有。所以，先生，我问你，你说说好处在哪里。’”","“Lookee here, old chap,” said Joe.“I done what I could to keep you and Tickler in sunders, but my power were not always fully equal to my inclinations.For when your poor sister had a mind to drop into you, it were not so much,” said Joe, in his favorite argumentative way, “that she dropped into me too, if I put myself in opposition to her but that she dropped into you always heavier for it.I noticed that.It ain’t a grab at a man’s whisker, not yet a shake or two of a man (to which your sister was quite welcome), that ’ud put a man off from getting a little child out of punishment.But when that little child is dropped into, heavier, for that grab of whisker or shaking, then that man naterally up and says to himself, ‘Where is the good as you are a-doing?I grant you I see the ’arm,’ says the man, ‘but I don’t see the good.I call upon you, sir, therefore, to pint out the good.’”"
"“那个人是这么说的吗？”我问，而此时乔正等着我回答他。","“The man says?” I observed, as Joe waited for me to speak."
"“那个人是这么说的。”乔说，“他对吗？”","“The man says,” Joe assented.“Is he right, that man?”"
"“亲爱的乔，他总是对的。”","“Dear Joe, he is always right.”"
"“嗯，老弟，”乔说，“你说话要当真。如果他总是对的（通常他更有可能是错的），那么他下面要说的话是对的：——假如说当你还是个小孩子的时候，你心里藏了一些事情，你之所以藏着很可能是因为你知道乔·格雷戈里没有挡住打在你身上的挠痒棍是因为他心有余而力不足。所以，不要再想这件事了，也不要再谈论这些没必要谈论的话题了。我来之前比迪费了好大的劲教我（因为我太迟钝了）应该这么看问题，还教我会看问题以后应该怎么说。这两件事都已做到。”乔说，他对他条理分明的谈论很满意，“下面是作为一个真正的朋友要对你说的。那就是：你不能太累，不过你得吃晚饭，得喝兑了水的酒，得裹着被子睡觉。”","“Well, old chap,” said Joe, “then abide by your words.If he’s always right (which in general he’s more likely wrong), he’s right when he says this:—Supposing ever you kep any little matter to yourself, when you was a little child, you kep it mostly because you know’d as J. Gargery’s power to part you and Tickler in sunders, were not fully equal to his inclinations.Therefore, think no more of it as betwixt two sech, and do not let us pass remarks upon onnecessary subjects.Biddy giv’ herself a deal o’ trouble with me afore I left (for I am almost awful dull), as I should view it in this light, and, viewing it in this light, as I should so put it.Both of which,” said Joe, quite charmed with his logical arrangement, “being done, now this to you a true friend, say.Namely.You mustn’t go a-over-doing on it, but you must have your supper and your wine-and-water, and you must be put betwixt the sheets.”"
"乔巧妙地绕过了这个话题，比迪以她女性特有的智慧，启发乔运用技巧和善意，很快就打开了我的话闸子，这给我留下了深刻的印象。不过，至于乔是否知道我目前穷困的状况，是否知道我的遗产就像我们家乡的沼泽地上那消散于阳光之下的雾气一样都化为了泡影，我不得而知。","The delicacy with which Joe dismissed this theme, and the sweet tact and kindness with which Biddy—who with her woman’s wit had found me out so soon—had prepared him for it, made a deep impression on my mind.But whether Joe knew how poor I was, and how my great expectations had all dissolved, like our own marsh mists before the sun, I could not understand."
"还有一件发生在乔身上的事，刚开始的时候我不能理解，但是很快我就悟到了，我很难过，那就是：我身体恢复得越好，乔对我就开始有些不自在了。在我病重而完全依赖他的时候，这位亲爱的伙计恢复了往日的语调，用我往日的称呼叫我，那一声声亲切的“皮普，老弟”如今在我听来如仙乐在耳。他也同意我用以往的称呼叫他，这让我开心不已、感动不已。可是，不知不觉当中，我对此很快就习惯了，而乔却越来越不这么做了。起初我左思右想都想不通，很快我就明白了，原因都在于我，过错都是我一手造成的。","Another thing in Joe that I could not understand when it first began to develop itself, but which I soon arrived at a sorrowful comprehension of, was this: As I became stronger and better, Joe became a little less easy with me.In my weakness and entire dependence on him, the dear fellow had fallen into the old tone, and called me by the old names, the dear “old Pip, old chap,” that now were music in my ears.I too had fallen into the old ways, only happy and thankful that he let me.But, imperceptibly, though I held by them fast, Joe’s hold upon them began to slacken; and whereas I wondered at this, at first, I soon began to understand that the cause of it was in me, and that the fault of it was all mine."
"啊！都是我给了乔怀疑我的忠诚的理由，是我让他认为，我病一好就会对他冷淡，把他抛弃，不是吗？都是我没能给乔那颗纯真的心足够的理由，让他本能地怀疑我强壮了以后，他和我的情谊就会冷淡。因此，他以为最好还是在我弃他而去之前及时放手，给我自由。","Ah!Had I given Joe no reason to doubt my constancy, and to think that in prosperity I should grow cold to him and cast him off?Had I given Joe’s innocent heart no cause to feel instinctively that as I got stronger, his hold upon me would be weaker, and that he had better loosen it in time and let me go, before I plucked myself away?"
"我们第三次还是第四次在坦普尔花园里散步时，我靠着乔的胳膊，我很清楚地看到了他的这一变化。我们在温暖明亮的阳光底下坐着，看着远处的河水，我们起身的时候，我正好说了一句：","It was on the third or fourth occasion of my going out walking in the Temple Gardens leaning on Joe’s arm, that I saw this change in him very plainly.We had been sitting in the bright warm sunlight, looking at the river, and I chanced to say as we got up:"
"“你看，乔！我身体变得很强壮了，我可以自己走了。你应该能看到我自己走回去了。”","“See, Joe! I can walk quite strongly.Now, you shall see me walk back by myself.”"
"“不要过度劳累，皮普。”乔说，“不过看到你能自己走回去我很高兴，先生。”","“Which do not over-do it, Pip,” said Joe; “but I shall be happy fur to see you able, sir.”"
"他最后一个字听起来很刺耳，可我怎么能抗议呢！我走到花园门口就没再走下去了，我假装更加虚弱了，请乔伸出手臂让我扶着走。乔向我伸出手臂，但心事重重。","The last word grated on me; but how could I remonstrate!I walked no further than the gate of the gardens, and then pretended to be weaker than I was, and asked Joe for his arm.Joe gave it me, but was thoughtful."
"至于我，同样也是心事重重，怎样才能阻止乔的这种心理变化呢，我本来就懊悔不已，现在更加无所适从了。要把我目前的处境如实向他汇报，我羞于启齿。我不是故意隐瞒，只是我希望，我瞒着不告诉他不是毫无意义的。我知道他会拿出他那微薄的积蓄来帮我，而且我知道我不能接受他的帮助，他这么做我会内心不安的。","I, for my part, was thoughtful too; for, how best to check this growing change in Joe, was a great perplexity to my remorseful thoughts.That I was ashamed to tell him exactly how I was placed, and what I had come down to, I do not seek to conceal; but, I hope my reluctance was not quite an unworthy one.He would want to help me out of his little savings, I knew, and I knew that he ought not to help me, and that I must not suffer him to do it."
"这个夜晚我们两个都心事重重。不过，我上床之前想好了，我要等过了明天再说，因为明天是星期天，我希望新的一周有新的开始。我准备星期一早上跟乔谈谈他的这一变化，放下我心头的最后一点秘密，我要告诉他我的想法（这是我心头的第二件事，至今尚未泄密），我还要告诉他我为什么不跟赫伯特一起走，这样他身上的变化就能消除。我心里没了顾虑，乔也没了顾虑，看起来就好像他和我之间有了心灵感应，他也做出了决定。","It was a thoughtful evening with both of us.But, before we went to bed, I had resolved that I would wait over to-morrow, to-morrow being Sunday, and would begin my new course with the new week.On Monday morning I would speak to Joe about this change, I would lay aside this last vestige of reserve, I would tell him what I had in my thoughts (that Secondly, not yet arrived at), and why I had not decided to go out to Herbert, and then the change would be conquered for ever.As I cleared, Joe cleared, and it seemed as though he had sympathetically arrived at a resolution too."
"这是一个安静的星期天，我们乘车去乡间，然后在田间漫步。","We had a quiet day on the Sunday, and we rode out into the country, and then walked in the fields."
"“我生了这样一场大病，真应该感谢上天，乔。”我说。","“I feel thankful that I have been ill, Joe,” I said."
"“亲爱的皮普老弟，你差不多好了，先生。”","“Dear old Pip, old chap, you’re a’most come round, sir.”"
"“这对我来说是一段难忘的日子，乔。”","“It has been a memorable time for me, Joe.”"
"“对我来说也是，先生。”乔说。","“Likeways for myself, sir,” Joe returned."
"“我们有一段共同度过的日子，乔，我永远也忘不了。我知道，我们过去有过这样的日子，我确实有一阵子忘记了，可我永远也不会忘记我们这一次一起度过的日子。”","“We have had a time together, Joe, that I can never forget.There were days once, I know, that I did for a while forget; but I never shall forget these.”"
"“皮普，”乔看起来有点慌乱，说，“我们过去有过一起的日子，而且，亲爱的先生，我们过去的事情——都已经过去了。”","“Pip,” said Joe, appearing a little hurried and troubled, “there has been larks, And, dear sir, what have been betwixt us—have been.”"
"晚上，我上床以后，乔到我的房间里来了，在我康复的这段时间里他每天晚上都来。他问我是不是感觉和早上一样好。","At night, when I had gone to bed, Joe came into my room, as he had done all through my recovery.He asked me if I felt sure that I was as well as in the morning?"
"“是的，亲爱的乔，我感觉很好。”","“Yes, dear Joe, quite.”"
"“也越来越有力气了，是吗，老弟？”","“And are always a-getting stronger, old chap?”"
"“是的，亲爱的乔，越来越有力气了。”","“Yes, dear Joe, steadily.”"
"乔用他那双大手在我肩头的被单上拍了拍，然后声音沙哑地对我说：“晚安！”","Joe patted the coverlet on my shoulder with his great good hand, and said, in what I thought a husky voice, “Good night!”"
"第二天我起床后，觉得精神抖擞、体力倍增，我下定决心要把一切都告诉他，再不拖延。我要在早餐前就告诉他。我要立刻穿好衣服到他房间去，给他一个惊喜，因为这是我第一次起这么早。我到他房间，发现他不在。没看见他的人，连他的行李箱也不见了。","When I got up in the morning, refreshed and stronger yet, I was full of my resolution to tell Joe all, without delay.I would tell him before breakfast.I would dress at once and go to his room and surprise him; for, it was the first day I had been up early.I went to his room, and he was not there.Not only was he not there, but his box was gone."
"我匆匆忙忙向早餐桌跑去，发现桌上有一封信。信的内容很简短。","I hurried then to the breakfast-table, and on it found a letter.These were its brief contents."
"“亲爱的皮普，你身体已经康复，我不想再打扰，故不辞而别。没有了乔你会更好的。","“Not wishful to intrude I have departured fur you are well again dear Pip and will do better without JO."
"附言：我们永远是最好的朋友。”","“P.S. Ever the best of friends.”"
"信封里还有一张收据，是我那笔欠款的还款收据，我还差点因为那笔欠款被捕。直到那一刻我才明白，我徒然以为我的债主退却了，或者延迟了日期，想等我康复了再说。我从来没想过乔已经替我还了债，可乔确实是替我还了，收据上签的是他的名字。","Enclosed in the letter, was a receipt for the debt and costs on which I had been arrested.Down to that moment I had vainly supposed that my creditor had withdrawn or suspended proceedings until I should be quite recovered.I had never dreamed of Joe’s having paid the money; but, Joe had paid it, and the receipt was in his name."
"现在留在我心里的事，第一是跟随他到昔日那亲切的铁匠铺去，在那里向他倾吐我的秘密，以及我对他的忏悔之意，还有就是要告诉他我心头的第二件事，一开始这只是一个萦绕在我脑海中的模糊的想法，后来变成了一个确定的决心。","What remained for me now, but to follow him to the dear old forge, and there to have out my disclosure to him, and my penitent remonstrance with him, and there to relieve my mind and heart of that reserved Secondly, which had begun as a vague something lingering in my thoughts, and had formed into a settled purpose?"
"这个决心就是，我要去找比迪，我要向她表明，我带着谦卑之心和悔恨之意回来了，我要告诉她我失去了我曾经追求的东西，我要让她回忆起在我最初不愉快的时光里我们曾有过的信任。然后，我要对她说：“比迪，你曾经那么喜欢我。即使后来离开了你，但我那颗漂泊不定的心和你在一起的时候，比其他任何时候都更加安宁、更加美好。如果你能再爱我一次，即使只用以前一半的感情，如果你能接受我的所有过错以及我给你带来的失望，如果你能像饶恕一个孩子一样饶恕我、接受我（我真的很抱歉，比迪，但我需要你的话语来安慰我，需要你的手来安抚我），我希望我能比以前更配得上你一些——没有很多，只有一点。比迪，有件事我需要你的答复，我以后是去乔的铁匠铺和他一起干活呢，还是应该在国内找个别的职业呢，或者我们一起到一个遥远的地方去，那里有一个机会在等着我，我把这个机会搁一边了，我要等你答复了我之后才能做出决定。而现在，亲爱的比迪，如果你告诉我你愿意跟我一起浪迹天涯，你一定能为我打造一个更好的世界，一定能让我成为这世上一个更好的人，而我也会努力为你开创一个更加美好的世界。”","The purpose was, that I would go to Biddy, that I would show her how humbled and repentant I came back, that I would tell her how I had lost all I once hoped for, that I would remind her of our old confidences in my first unhappy time.Then, I would say to her, “Biddy, I think you once liked me very well, when my errant heart, even while it strayed away from you, was quieter and better with you than it ever has been since.If you can like me only half as well once more, if you can take me with all my faults and disappointments on my head, if you can receive me like a forgiven child (and indeed I am as sorry, Biddy, and have as much need of a hushing voice and a soothing hand), I hope I am a little worthier of you that I was—not much, but a little.And, Biddy, it shall rest with you to say whether I shall work at the forge with Joe, or whether I shall try for any different occupation down in this country, or whether we shall go away to a distant place where an opportunity awaits me, which I set aside when it was offered, until I knew your answer.And now, dear Biddy, if you can tell me that you will go through the world with me, you will surely make it a better world for me, and me a better man for it, and I will try hard to make it a better world for you.”"
"这就是我的决心。又过了三天，我前往故乡，去了却我这一桩心愿。我接下来要讲的就是我怎样施行这一打算的。","Such was my purpose.After three days more of recovery, I went down to the old place, to put it in execution; and how I sped in it, is all I have left to tell."
"第五十八章","Chapter 58"
"在我回故乡之前，我的巨额财产化为泡沫的消息就已经不胫而走，传到了我的家乡各地。我发现消息也传到了“蓝野猪”饭店，“蓝野猪”对我的态度发生了一百八十度的大转变。我交上财运的时候，“蓝野猪”对我是热情招待，不敢怠慢，可现在我的财运没了，“蓝野猪”对我便异常冷淡。","The tidings of my high fortunes having had a heavy fall, had got down to my native place and its neighborhood, before I got there.I found the Blue Boar in possession of the intelligence, and I found that it made a great change in the Boar’s demeanor.Whereas the Boar had cultivated my good opinion with warm assiduity when I was coming into property, the Boar was exceedingly cool on the subject now that I was going out of property."
"我到达“蓝野猪”饭店的时候已经是晚上了，虽然平日过来都轻松自如，今天这一路下来却让我疲惫不堪。“蓝野猪”无法安排我住进我往常住的那间房了，说是有人已经订了（可能是某个有一大笔遗产的人），只能给我安排院子旁边一间非常不起眼的房，与鸽子和驿马为伍。不过，我在那间房里美美地睡了一觉，即使让我在“蓝野猪”最好的房间里住上一晚，也没什么两样。我在那间房里做的梦，和在最好的房间里做的梦也没什么两样。","It was evening when I arrived, much fatigued by the journey I had so often made so easily.The Boar could not put me into my usual bedroom, which was engaged (probably by some one who had expectations), and could only assign me a very indifferent chamber among the pigeons and post-chaises up the yard.But, I had as sound a sleep in that lodging as in the most superior accommodation the Boar could have given me, and the quality of my dreams was about the same as in the best bedroom."
"次日清早，趁着早餐还在准备当中，我到沙提斯庄园去转了一圈。门上贴着印刷好的招租广告，窗上挂着毛毯的碎片，上面写着：下周这所宅子里的家具和财物将被拍卖。宅子本身将当成旧的建筑材料卖掉，然后全部拆毁。酿酒作坊的厂房用石灰水刷上了“一号地皮”字样，字是东倒西歪的。那座早就关了的主楼刷上了“二号地皮”的字样。这座宅子还有其他地方也被标上了字样，为了便于刷字，墙上的常春藤被拉了下来。很多拉下来的常春藤被扔进了尘土里，已经枯萎了。大门是敞开的，我走了进去，停了一会儿，不自在地环顾了一下四周，那神情就好像是一个在那里无事可做的陌生人。我看见拍卖行的办事员在啤酒桶上踱着步子，数着桶的数目，以便编入目录。他手里握着一支笔，把我当年常常一面唱着《老克莱门之歌》，一面推着的轮椅当成了临时的办公桌。","Early in the morning while my breakfast was getting ready, I strolled round by Satis House.There were printed bills on the gate, and on bits of carpet hanging out of the windows, announcing a sale by auction of the Household Furniture and Effects, next week.The House itself was to be sold as old building materials and pulled down.LOT 1 was marked in whitewashed knock-knee letters on the brew house; LOT 2 on that part of the main building which had been so long shut up.Other lots were marked off on other parts of the structure, and the ivy had been torn down to make room for the inscriptions, and much of it trailed low in the dust and was withered already.Stepping in for a moment at the open gate and looking around me with the uncomfortable air of a stranger who had no business there, I saw the auctioneer’s clerk walking on the casks and telling them off for the information of a catalogue compiler, pen in hand, who made a temporary desk of the wheeled chair I had so often pushed along to the tune of Old Clem."
"我回到“蓝野猪”咖啡室用早餐时，看见彭波契克先生正在和店主说话。彭波契克先生在等我（上次夜间遇险的经历在他脸上留下的印记还没有消去），他用下面的措词跟我说话。","When I got back to my breakfast in the Boar’s coffee-room, I found Mr. Pumblechook conversing with the landlord.Mr. Pumblechook (not improved in appearance by his late nocturnal adventure) was waiting for me, and addressed me in the following terms."
"“年轻人，我很遗憾看你摔得这么重。可还能指望怎样呢！还能指望怎样呢！”","“Young man, I am sorry to see you brought low.But what else could be expected!What else could be expected!”"
"他带着一副宽宏大量的神情向我伸出手来，我因为身子被病给拖垮了，不宜和他争论，也伸手给他。","As he extended his hand with a magnificently forgiving air, and as I was broken by illness and unfit to quarrel, I took it."
"“威廉，”彭波契克先生对服务生说，“拿一块松饼来放桌上。竟然落到这步田地！竟然落到这步田地！”","“William,” said Mr. Pumblechook to the waiter, “put a muffin on table.And has it come to this!Has it come to this!”"
"我皱着眉坐下来吃饭。彭波契克先生站在我旁边，没等我手碰杯，就给我倒好了一杯茶，还带着一副恩主的神气，他是下定了决心要把恩主这个角色扮演到底。","I frowningly sat down to my breakfast.Mr. Pumblechook stood over me and poured out my tea—before I could touch the teapot—with the air of a benefactor who was resolved to be true to the last."
"“威廉，”彭波契克先生一脸哀伤地说，“在上面撒点盐。你走运的时候，”他对我说，“我想你加的是糖吧。你加牛奶吗？应该是加的。糖和牛奶。威廉，拿根水芹菜来。”","“William,” said Mr. Pumblechook, mournfully, “put the salt on.In happier times,” addressing me, “I think you took sugar.And did you take milk?You did.Sugar and milk.William, bring a watercress.”"
"“谢谢，”我马上说了一句，“可我不吃水芹菜。”","“Thank you,” said I, shortly, “but I don’t eat watercresses.”"
"“你不吃水芹菜。”彭波契克先生说，又是点头，又是叹气的，还重复了好几次，好像他早就料到了，好像我正是因为不吃水芹菜才落到了今天这步田地。“当然了。那是地上长的贫贱菜。不用了。你不用去拿了，威廉。”","“You don’t eat ’em,” returned Mr. Pumblechook, sighing and nodding his head several times, as if he might have expected that, and as if abstinence from watercresses were consistent with my downfall.“True.The simple fruits of the earth.No.You needn’t bring any, William.”"
"我继续吃我的早餐，彭波契克先生继续站在那里，面无表情地盯着我看，喘着粗气，他总是这副德性。","I went on with my breakfast, and Mr. Pumblechook continued to stand over me, staring fishily and breathing noisily, as he always did."
"“瘦得只剩下皮包骨了！”彭波契克先生一边思考着，一边大声地说，“可记得当初他离开这里的时候（请允许我这么说），我把我那像蜜蜂一样勤勤恳恳积累的、一点微薄的积蓄放在他面前，他那时就像一只桃子一样丰满！”","“Little more than skin and bone!” mused Mr. Pumblechook, aloud. “And yet when he went from here (I may say with my blessing), and I spread afore him my humble store, like the Bee, he was as plump as a Peach!”"
"这让我想起了在我刚交好运的时候，他曾奴颜婢膝地向我伸出手，问：“我可以吗？”而他刚才向我伸出同样胖胖的五根手指，却摆出一副宽厚、仁慈的长者之态。","This reminded me of the wonderful difference between the servile manner in which he had offered his hand in my new prosperity, saying, “May I?” and the ostentatious clemency with which he had just now exhibited the same fat five fingers."
"“哈！”他一边把黄油面包递给我，一边接着说道，“你要到约瑟夫那里去吗？”","“Hah!” he went on, handing me the bread-and-butter.“And air you a-going to Joseph?”"
"“天哪，”我抑制不住满腔的怒火，“我到哪里去跟你有什么关系？不要动我的茶壶。”","“In heaven’s name,” said I, firing in spite of myself, “what does it matter to you where I am going?Leave that teapot alone.”"
"这是我说的最糟糕的一句话，因为这给了彭波契克他想要的机会。","It was the worst course I could have taken, because it gave Pumblechook the opportunity he wanted."
"“是的，年轻人，”他说着松开了茶壶柄，从我的桌边后退了一两步，对着门口的店主和茶房说，“我会把茶壶放下的。你说得对，年轻人。这一次，你说得对。你要谅解我，我这样关心你的早餐，是希望你身体健康，你在外面花天酒地把身子弄垮了，我才叫了一份你祖宗吃的营养品给你补补。可是，”彭波契克转身面向店主和茶房，伸直了胳膊指着我说，“就是这个人，在他快乐的童年时代，我还陪他一起玩呢！不要跟我说这不可能，我告诉你们，就是这个人！”","“Yes, young man,” said he, releasing the handle of the article in question, retiring a step or two from my table, and speaking for the behoof of the landlord and waiter at the door, “I will leave that teapot alone.You are right, young man.For once, you are right.I forgit myself when I take such an interest in your breakfast, as to wish your frame, exhausted by the debilitating effects of prodigygality, to be stimilated by the ’olesome nourishment of your forefathers.And yet,” said Pumblechook, turning to the landlord and waiter, and pointing me out at arm’s length, “this is him as I ever sported with in his days of happy infancy!Tell me not it cannot be; I tell you this is him!”"
"那两个人小声嘀咕着作为回答。茶房看起来对他的话特别感兴趣。","A low murmur from the two replied.The waiter appeared to be particularly affected."
"“就是这个人，”彭波契克说，“我一直让他坐我的马车。就是这个人，我亲眼看着他姐姐把他一手带大的。就是这个人，他姐姐的丈夫叫我叔叔，他姐姐叫乔治亚娜·玛利亚，沿用了她母亲的名字，这是事实，看他怎么否认！”","“This is him,” said Pumblechook, “as I have rode in my shaycart.This is him as I have seen brought up by hand.This is him untoe the sister of which I was uncle by marriage, as her name was Georgiana M’ria from her own mother, let him deny it if he can!”"
"茶房看起来相信了他的话，认为我不能否认这个事实，这使得这件事蒙上了一层阴影。","The waiter seemed convinced that I could not deny it, and that it gave the case a black look."
"“年轻人，”彭波契克以他惯用的姿势把头转向我说，“你要到约瑟夫那里去。你问我，你到哪里去跟我有什么关系？我跟你说，先生，你要到约瑟夫那里去。”","“Young man,” said Pumblechook, screwing his head at me in the old fashion, “you air a-going to Joseph.What does it matter to me, you ask me, where you air a-going?I say to you, Sir, you air a-going to Joseph.”"
"茶房咳嗽了一声，好像是要客气地请我把这事说清楚。","The waiter coughed, as if he modestly invited me to get over that."
"“现在，”彭波契克摆出一副让人气愤不已的神情，仿佛他要说的都是颠扑不破的真理，“我来告诉你该对约瑟夫说什么。在场的有‘蓝野猪’饭店的斯夸尔斯先生，他是镇上受人尊敬的名人，威廉也在这里，要是我没记错的话，他父亲的名字应该是鲍金斯。”","“Now,” said Pumblechook, and all this with a most exasperating air of saying in the cause of virtue what was perfectly convincing and conclusive, “I will tell you what to say to Joseph.Here is Squires of the Boar present, known and respected in this town, and here is William, which his father’s name was Potkins if I do not deceive myself.”"
"“你没记错，先生。”威廉说。","“You do not, sir,” said William."
"“当着他们的面，”彭波契克接着说道，“我来告诉你，年轻人，你要对约瑟夫说什么。你要这么说，‘约瑟夫，我今天看见我最初的恩主和我财产的奠基人了。我就不说名字了，约瑟夫，不过镇上的人都乐意这样叫他，我见到那个人了。’”","“In their presence,” pursued Pumblechook, “I will tell you, young man, what to say to Joseph.Says you, ‘Joseph, I have this day seen my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortun’s.I will name no names, Joseph, but so they are pleased to call him up-town, and I have seen that man.’”"
"“我发誓我没有在这里见过他。”我说。","“I swear I don’t see him here,” said I."
"“说类似那样的话就行。”彭波契克反驳道，“你要是那么说，即使是约瑟夫也可能会惊讶的。”","“Say that likewise,” retorted Pumblechook.“Say you said that, and even Joseph will probably betray surprise.”"
"“那你就误会他了，”我说，“我比你了解他。”","“There you quite mistake him,” said I.“I know better.”"
"“你这么说，”彭波契克继续说道，“‘约瑟夫，我见到那个人了，他对你没有恶意，对我也没有恶意。他知道你的性格，约瑟夫，他知道你固执又无知，他也知道我的性格，约瑟夫，他知道我忘恩负义。是的，约瑟夫，’你说，”说到这里，彭波契克对我摇了摇头，摆了摆手，“‘他知道做人起码的知恩图报之心，我却一点也没有。他知道，约瑟夫，只有他知道。你不知道，约瑟夫，你没有理由知道，可那个人都知道。’”","“Says you,” Pumblechook went on, “‘Joseph, I have seen that man, and that man bears you no malice and bears me no malice.He knows your character, Joseph, and is well acquainted with your pig-headedness and ignorance; and he knows my character, Joseph, and he knows my want of gratitoode.Yes, Joseph,’ says you,” here Pumblechook shook his head and hand at me, “‘he knows my total deficiency of common human gratitoode.He knows it, Joseph, as none can.You do not know it, Joseph, having no call to know it, but that man do.’”"
"虽然他只是一头爱吹牛的驴子，不过他竟然敢对我说这样的话，这让我很惊讶。","Windy donkey as he was, it really amazed me that he could have the face to talk thus to mine."
"“你这样说，‘约瑟夫，他给过我一个口信，现在我复述给你听。是这么说的，在我走下坡路的时候，他看见了上帝的手指。他认出了上帝的手指，约瑟夫，他清清楚楚地认出来了。上帝的手指写出了这样的字，约瑟夫：凡对最初之恩主及财产奠基人忘恩负义者必得此报。可那个人说他对他所做的事情不后悔，约瑟夫。一点也不后悔。他这么做是对的，他这么做是好的，他这么做是在行善，他说他以后还会这么做的。’”","“Says you, ‘Joseph, he gave me a little message, which I will now repeat.It was, that in my being brought low, he saw the finger of Providence.He knowed that finger when he saw it, Joseph, and he saw it plain.It pinted out this writing, Joseph.Reward of ingratitoode to his earliest benefactor, and founder of fortun’s.But that man said he did not repent of what he had done, Joseph.Not at all.It was right to do it, it was kind to do it, it was benevolent to do it, and he would do it again.’”"
"“可惜的是，”我吃着被打断的早餐，轻蔑地说，“那个人并没有说他做了什么，也没说他以后还要这么做。”","“It’s pity,” said I, scornfully, as I finished my interrupted breakfast, “that the man did not say what he had done and would do again.”"
"“‘蓝野猪’饭店的斯夸尔斯先生！”彭波契克现在是对着店主在说话，“还有你，威廉！你们去说吧，不管是到镇里还是到乡下去说，随你们的便，我都没意见。你们说我这么做是对的，是好的，是在行善，说我以后还会这么做的。”","“Squires of the Boar!” Pumblechook was now addressing the landlord, “and William!I have no objections to your mentioning, either up-town or down-town, if such should be your wishes, that it was right to do it, kind to do it, benevolent to do it, and that I would do it again.”"
"这个骗子说完了那番话，便摆出一副神情跟他们两个人握手，然后离开了饭店。他没完没了重复的那几条，非但没让我高兴，反而让我觉得震惊。他走后没多久我也离开了饭店，我走到大街上，看见他正站在店门口，对着一群上流人士高谈阔论（无疑是在说同样的话），我在街对面经过他们时，他们很不友好地向我投来白眼。","With those words the Impostor shook them both by the hand, with an air, and left the house; leaving me much more astonished than delighted by the virtues of that same indefinite “it.”I was not long after him in leaving the house too, and when I went down the High-street I saw him holding forth (no doubt to the same effect) at his shop door to a select group, who honored me with very unfavorable glances as I passed on the opposite side of the way."
"不过，到比迪和乔那里去，心情只会更加愉悦，他们从前就很有包容心，现在愈加包容了，这一点那个厚颜无耻的骗子是没得比的。我四肢仍然无力，慢慢向他们家走去。不过我离他们越近，心情就越轻松，感觉自己离骄傲和虚伪就越远。","But, it was only the pleasanter to turn to Biddy and to Joe, whose great forbearance shone more brightly than before, if that could be, contrasted with this brazen pretender.I went towards them slowly, for my limbs were weak, but with a sense of increasing relief as I drew nearer to them, and a sense of leaving arrogance and untruthfulness further and further behind."
"六月的天气十分宜人。蓝蓝的天空下，云雀在绿色的谷地上的高空中翱翔，这时的我觉得乡村比我之前所认识的要美丽得多、宁静得多。我想，我的身边一旦有了一位精神向导，她朴素的信念和明晰的智慧将展开我今后生活的美好图景，我的性格将向更好的方向转变，我一路上就这么想着来打发时间。这些唤起了我心里的温情，我这次回来，我的心已经变柔和了，确实发生了这样的改变。我觉得自己就像一个流浪了多年的人，历经长途跋涉，赤着双脚，从遥远的地方回到了家。","The June weather was delicious.The sky was blue, the larks were soaring high over the green corn, I thought all that country-side more beautiful and peaceful by far than I had ever known it to be yet.Many pleasant pictures of the life that I would lead there, and of the change for the better that would come over my character when I had a guiding spirit at my side whose simple faith and clear home-wisdom I had proved, beguiled my way.They awakened a tender emotion in me; for, my heart was softened by my return, and such a change had come to pass, that I felt like one who was toiling home barefoot from distant travel, and whose wanderings had lasted many years."
"比迪执教的那所学校我从来没有见过，不过，我为了不让人发现，悄悄绕道走小路去村子，这条小路会经过学校。这天是休息日，孩子们都不在，比迪的屋子也关着，这让我很失望。我之前想趁她发现我之前，先去看看她是怎样忙她的日常工作的，而我的这一想法落空了。","The schoolhouse where Biddy was mistress, I had never seen; but, the little roundabout lane by which I entered the village for quietness’ sake, took me past it.I was disappointed to find that the day was a holiday; no children were there, and Biddy’s house was closed.Some hopeful notion of seeing her busily engaged in her daily duties, before she saw me, had been in my mind and was defeated."
"不过，铁匠铺离这里很近。我向铁匠铺走去，走到了一棵芳香的菩提树下，倾听乔敲打铁锤的声音。我应该听见的，而且我认为我听见了，可听了很久才发现这只是我的幻觉，周围是一片寂静。菩提树在那里，山楂树在那里，栗子树也在那里，我停下脚步倾听，听见树叶沙沙作响，声音十分和谐，可是，仲夏的风没有送来乔敲打铁锤的声音。","But, the forge was a very short distance off, and I went towards it under the sweet green limes, listening for the clink of Joe’s hammer.Long after I ought to have heard it, and long after I had fancied I heard it and found it but a fancy, all was still.The limes were there, and the white thorns were there, and the chestnut-trees were there, and their leaves rustled harmoniously when I stopped to listen; but, the clink of Joe’s hammer was not in the midsummer wind."
"不知为什么，我几乎害怕看见铁匠铺了，但最后还是来到了铁匠铺前，发现门是关着的。铁匠铺里没有一丝火光，没有一点火星，也没有风箱的咆哮声，一切都寂静无声。","Almost fearing, without knowing why, to come in view of the forge, I saw it at last, and saw that it was closed.No gleam of fire, no glittering shower of sparks, no roar of bellows; all shut up, and still."
"不过，这所房子并没有废弃闲置，最好的那间客厅似乎还有人住，因为窗上白色的窗帘在飘动，而且窗子是开着的，装饰着鲜花，一派喜庆。我轻轻地朝窗子走去，想透过鲜花向里窥探一下，这时却见乔和比迪手挽着手站在我面前。","But, the house was not deserted, and the best parlor seemed to be in use, for there were white curtains fluttering in its window, and the window was open and gay with flowers.I went softly towards it, meaning to peep over the flowers, when Joe and Biddy stood before me, arm in arm."
"比迪一看见我先是惊叫了一声，似乎她以为自己看到的是我的鬼魂，不过一会儿之后，她便被我抱住了。我看见她流泪了，她看见我也流泪了，我流泪是因为她看起来这样精神、这样可人，她流泪是因为我看起来这样憔悴、这样苍白。","At first Biddy gave a cry, as if she thought it was my apparition, but in another moment she was in my embrace.I wept to see her, and she wept to see me; I, because she looked so fresh and pleasant; she, because I looked so worn and white."
"“亲爱的比迪，你多漂亮啊！”","“But dear Biddy, how smart you are!”"
"“是的，亲爱的皮普。”","“Yes, dear Pip.”"
"“乔，你今天也很漂亮！”","“And Joe, how smart you are!”"
"“是的，亲爱的皮普老弟。”","“Yes, dear old Pip, old chap.”"
"我看着他们俩，从他看到她，又从她看到他，然后——","I looked at both of them, from one to the other, and then—"
"“今天是我结婚的日子，”比迪突然开心地喊道，“我和乔结婚了！”","“It’s my wedding-day,” cried Biddy, in a burst of happiness, “and I am married to Joe!”"
"他们把我带进了厨房，我坐下后把头靠在往日的那张松木桌上。比迪拉起我的一只手，放到她的唇边，乔在我的肩上拍了拍。“他还没有完全康复，亲爱的，不要惊动他。”乔说。比迪说：“我应该想到这一点的，亲爱的乔，可我太高兴了。”他们看见我来了都非常开心，非常自豪，非常感动，我的意外造访使他们今天这个日子圆满了！","They had taken me into the kitchen, and I had laid my head down on the old deal table.Biddy held one of my hands to her lips, and Joe’s restoring touch was on my shoulder.“Which he warn’t strong enough, my dear, fur to be surprised,” said Joe.And Biddy said, “I ought to have thought of it, dear Joe, but I was too happy.”They were both so overjoyed to see me, so proud to see me, so touched by my coming to them, so delighted that I should have come by accident to make their day complete!"
"我当时第一个想法就是，谢天谢地，我没有把我最后一个令人困惑的希望告诉乔。我生病期间和他在一起的时候，这话曾多次溜到我的嘴边。要是他和我多呆上哪怕一个小时，让他知道了我的想法，该是多么无可挽回啊！","My first thought was one of great thankfulness that I had never breathed this last baffled hope to Joe.How often, while he was with me in my illness, had it risen to my lips.How irrevocable would have been his knowledge of it, if he had remained with me but another hour!"
"“亲爱的比迪，”我说，“你的丈夫是这世上最好的丈夫，你要是看见他在我病中照顾我的样子，你就会——不，你对他的爱已经深到不能再深了。”","“Dear Biddy,” said I, “you have the best husband in the whole world, and if you could have seen him by my bed you would have—But no, you couldn’t love him better than you do.”"
"“是的，不能再深了。”比迪说。","“No, I couldn’t indeed,” said Biddy."
"“还有，亲爱的乔，你的妻子是这世上最好的妻子，她会使你得到你应该得到的幸福，亲爱的、善良的、高尚的乔！”","“And, dear Joe, you have the best wife in the whole world, and she will make you as happy as even you deserve to be, you dear, good, noble Joe!”"
"乔望着我，嘴唇在颤抖，他用衣袖擦了擦眼睛。","Joe looked at me with a quivering lip, and fairly put his sleeve before his eyes."
"“乔、比迪，你们今天去过教堂了，和所有的人一起共享慈悲和爱，请接受我卑微的感谢，谢谢你们为我所做的一切，而我却一点也没有回报你们！我在这里只能呆一个小时，因为我马上就要出国了，我要挣钱还给你们，你们替我还债，让我免受牢狱之苦，我不把钱寄来还给你们，我就不休息。亲爱的乔和比迪，我即使拿一千倍的钱来还你们，我欠你们的也还是一分一厘也还不清，要是能还清的话我早就去做了！”","“And Joe and Biddy both, as you have been to church today, and are in charity and love with all mankind, receive my humble thanks for all you have done for me and all I have so ill repaid!And when I say that I am going away within the hour, for I am soon going abroad, and that I shall never rest until I have worked for the money with which you have kept me out of prison, and have sent it to you, don’t think, dear Joe and Biddy, that if I could repay it a thousand times over, I suppose I could cancel a farthing of the debt I owe you, or that I would do so if I could!”"
"他们两人听了我的这番话，心都软了下来，恳求我不要再说了。","They were both melted by these words, and both entreated me to say no more."
"“但我必须再说几句。亲爱的乔，我希望你们能有自己的孩子，去爱他，这样在某个冬日的夜晚，这个小家伙会坐在这火炉旁，也许会让你想起另外一个小家伙，虽然这永远成为过去了。乔，不要告诉他我是个忘恩负义的人，比迪，不要告诉他我是个胸襟狭窄的人，只告诉他我敬重你们，因为你们都是那么好、那么正直的人，而且，作为你们的孩子，他自然而然地会成为一个比我好得多的人。”","“But I must say more.Dear Joe, I hope you will have children to love, and that some little fellow will sit in this chimney corner of a winter night, who may remind you of another little fellow gone out of it for ever.Don’t tell him, Joe, that I was thankless; don’t tell him, Biddy, that I was ungenerous and unjust; only tell him that I honored you both, because you were both so good and true, and that, as your child, I said it would be natural to him to grow up a much better man than I did.”"
"乔用衣袖挡着自己说：“我不会告诉他这些的，皮普。比迪也不会。谁也不会。”","“I ain’t a-going,” said Joe, from behind his sleeve, “to tell him nothink o’ that natur, Pip.Nor Biddy ain’t.Nor yet no one ain’t.”"
"“现在，虽然我知道你们都是好心肠的人，你们心里已经这么做了，但请你们对我说，你们原谅我！请让我听见你们说这句话，我可以把你们说的这句话带在身边，这样将来我就能相信，你们可以信任我，你们改变了对我的看法！”","“And now, though I know you have already done it in your own kind hearts, pray tell me, both, that you forgive me!Pray let me hear you say the words, that I may carry the sound of them away with me, and then I shall be able to believe that you can trust me, and think better of me, in the time to come!”"
"“噢，亲爱的皮普，老弟。”乔说，“如果真的有什么需要我原谅，上帝知道我原谅你了！”","“O dear old Pip, old chap,” said Joe.“God knows as I forgive you, if I have anythink to forgive!”"
"“阿门！上帝知道我原谅你了！”比迪也说道。","“Amen!And God knows I do!” echoed Biddy."
"“现在我要上楼去看看我的房间，我要在那里一个人呆几分钟，然后我和你们一起吃点喝点东西，然后你们和我一起走到指路牌那里。亲爱的乔，亲爱的比迪，我们就在那里道别吧！”","“Now let me go up and look at my old little room, and rest there a few minutes by myself, and then when I have eaten and drunk with you, go with me as far as the finger-post, dear Joe and Biddy, before we say good-bye!”"
"我变卖了所有的家产，尽可能拿来还债——我的债主也给了我充足的时间让我还清欠款——之后我便启程到赫伯特那里去了。一个月后，我离开了英格兰，两个月后，我成了克拉利克公司的办事员，四个月后，我首次独自担起了整个公司的责任。米尔庞德岸上那横跨客厅天花板的横梁已经恢复了平静，不再被老比尔·巴利的咆哮震得发抖了。赫伯特去和克拉拉结婚了，在他带她回来之前，东方分公司就剩下我一个人负责了。","I sold all I had, and put aside as much as I could, for a composition with my creditors—who gave me ample time to pay them in full—and I went out and joined Herbert.Within a month, I had quitted England, and within two months I was clerk to Clarriker and Co., and within four months I assumed my first undivided responsibility.For, the beam across the parlor ceiling at Mill Pond Bank, had then ceased to tremble under old Bill Barley’s growls and was at peace, and Herbert had gone away to marry Clara, and I was left in sole charge of the Eastern Branch until he brought her back."
"很多年过去了，我也成了这家公司的合伙人，我跟赫伯特和他的妻子生活在一起，我过得很节俭，还清了欠款，跟比迪和乔一直保持通信。直到我成为这家公司的三把手，克拉利克才把我的秘密告诉了赫伯特。不过，他声明赫伯特的合伙人身份这一秘密一直以来盘桓在他的心头，他必须得告诉他了。所以他就说了，赫伯特当时既感动又吃惊，这位亲爱的伙计和我的友情并没有因为这一隐瞒了许久的秘密而变糟。我必须澄清，以免让人以为我们公司是一家大公司，或是以为我们挣了大把大把的钱。我们的生意做得并不大，不过我们有很好的声誉，我们公司以营利为目的，办得很出色。赫伯特总是那么勤勉、那么机敏，这使人振奋，他给我们公司的帮助很大。我常常想，我过去怎么会怀疑他的能力呢，直到有一天我幡然醒悟，或许，能力差的从来就不是他，而恰恰是我。","Many a year went round, before I was a partner in the House; but, I lived happily with Herbert and his wife, and lived frugally, and paid my debts, and maintained a constant correspondence with Biddy and Joe.It was not until I became third in the Firm, that Clarriker betrayed me to Herbert; but, he then declared that the secret of Herbert’s partnership had been long enough upon his conscience, and he must tell it.So, he told it, and Herbert was as much moved as amazed, and the dear fellow and I were not the worse friends for the long concealment.I must not leave it to be supposed that we were ever a great house, or that we made mints of money.We were not in a grand way of business, but we had a good name, and worked for our profits, and did very well.We owed so much to Herbert’s ever cheerful industry and readiness, that I often wondered how I had conceived that old idea of his inaptitude, until I was one day enlightened by the reflection, that perhaps the inaptitude had never been in him at all, but had been in me."
"第五十九章","Chapter 59"
"十一年来，我都没有亲眼见到乔和比迪，虽然我在东方常常想起他们。十一年过去了，这是十二月里的一个夜晚，天已经黑了一两个小时了，我把手轻轻地放在那间昔日的厨房的门闩上。我动作很轻，没有人听见我的声音，我朝里望去，没有人看见我。乔还坐在火炉旁的老位子上，吸着烟管，他还和过去一样健壮，只是头发有些灰白。乔的一条腿伸进一个角落里，护着一个孩子，那孩子坐在我过去坐的小凳上，看着炉火，简直就是我的化身！","For eleven years, I had not seen Joe nor Biddy with my bodily eyes—though they had both been often before my fancy in the East—when, upon an evening in December, an hour or two after dark, I laid my hand softly on the latch of the old kitchen door.I touched it so softly that I was not heard, and looked in unseen.There, smoking his pipe in the old place by the kitchen firelight, as hale and as strong as ever though a little grey, sat Joe; and there, fenced into the corner with Joe’s leg, and sitting on my own little stool looking at the fire, was—I again!"
"“因为你的缘故，我们给他取名叫皮普，亲爱的老弟。”我搬过一条凳子，坐在这孩子的身边（但我没有去弄乱他的头发），乔见此很高兴地对我说，“我们希望他长得有些像你，我们觉得他的确有些像你。”","“We giv’ him the name of Pip for your sake, dear old chap,” said Joe, delighted when I took another stool by the child’s side (but I did not rumple his hair), “and we hoped he might grow a little bit like you, and we think he do.”"
"我也这么觉得。第二天早上我带小皮普出去散步，我们谈了很多，双方都很了解对方。我带他到教堂墓地去，把他放在那里的一块墓石上，他坐在那里指着一块石头给我看，石头上庄严地写着：本教区居民菲利普·皮利普及上述者之妻乔治亚娜之墓。","I thought so too, and I took him out for a walk next morning, and we talked immensely, understanding one another to perfection.And I took him down to the churchyard, and set him on a certain tombstone there, and he showed me from that elevation which stone was sacred to the memory of Philip Pirrip, late of this Parish, and Also Georgiana, Wife of the Above."
"“比迪，”吃过晚饭，等她的小女儿躺在她腿上睡着了，我对她说，“你哪天把皮普过继给我吧，要不然，无论如何也让我带带他吧。”","“Biddy,” said I, when I talked with her after dinner, as her little girl lay sleeping in her lap, “you must give Pip to me, one of these days; or lend him, at all events.”"
"“不，不，”比迪温和地说，“你必须结婚。”","“No, no,” said Biddy, gently.“You must marry.”"
"“赫伯特和克拉拉也是这么说的，可我认为我不会结婚的，比迪。我在他们家住惯了，我不可能结婚。我已经是个老光棍了。”","“So Herbert and Clara say, but I don’t think I shall, Biddy.I have so settled down in their home, that it’s not at all likely.I am already quite an old bachelor.”"
"比迪低下头看着她的孩子，把孩子的小手放在她的嘴唇上，然后把这只接受过她母性爱抚的手放在我的手上。比迪的这一动作还有她的结婚戒指在我的手上轻轻地一按，这其中包含了深刻的涵义。","Biddy looked down at her child, and put its little hand to her lips, and then put the good matronly hand with which she had touched it, into mine.There was something in the action and in the light pressure of Biddy’s wedding-ring, that had a very pretty eloquence in it."
"“亲爱的皮普，”比迪说，“你当真不再为她而烦恼了吗？”","“Dear Pip,” said Biddy, “you are sure you don’t fret for her?”"
"“噢，是的，我想我不再为她而烦恼了，比迪。”","“O no—I think not, Biddy.”"
"“作为老朋友，你告诉我。你彻底忘掉她了吗？”","“Tell me as an old, old friend.Have you quite forgotten her?”"
"“我亲爱的比迪，在我生命中占据过最重要地位的东西，我一点也没有忘记，在我生命中占据过一席之地的东西，我也没有忘记。但那个可怜的梦，我过去常常称呼它为可怜的梦，都消逝了，比迪，都消逝了！”","“My dear Biddy, I have forgotten nothing in my life that ever had a foremost place there, and little that ever had any place there.But that poor dream, as I once used to call it, has all gone by, Biddy, all gone by!”"
"不过，我知道虽然我嘴里这么说，可我心里还是偷偷地盘算，晚上我要重访那座老宅子，一个人去，为了她。是的，即使是这样。为了埃斯特拉。","Nevertheless, I knew while I said those words, that I secretly intended to revisit the site of the old house that evening, alone, for her sake.Yes even so.For Estella’s sake."
"我听说她日子过得很不如意，已经跟他丈夫分开了，她丈夫对她十分残酷，成了一个集骄傲、贪婪、粗暴、卑鄙于一身的、臭名昭著的人。我还听说她丈夫有一次骑马的时候，因为虐待自己的马，结果出了事丧了命。这是大约两年前的事了，她也因此获得了解脱，据我猜测，她应该再婚了。","I had heard of her as leading a most unhappy life, and as being separated from her husband, who had used her with great cruelty, and who had become quite renowned as a compound of pride, avarice, brutality, and meanness.And I had heard of the death of her husband, from an accident consequent on his ill-treatment of a horse.This release had befallen her some two years before; for anything I knew, she was married again."
"乔家里晚饭开饭很早，这使得我有充足的时间饭后跟比迪闲谈一下，然后在天黑之前走到古宅旧址去。不过，由于我一路走走停停，看看昔日的景物，想想过去的时光，我到宅子的时候天色已经黑了。","The early dinner-hour at Joe’s, left me abundance of time, without hurrying my talk with Biddy, to walk over to the old spot before dark.But, what with loitering on the way, to look at old objects and to think of old times, the day had quite declined when I came to the place."
"这里除了旧日花园的围墙之外，已经没有了当年的房屋，没有了酿酒作坊，没有了其他遗留的建筑。清空了的土地上随意地围上了一圈篱笆，篱笆那边，我看见一些昔日的常春藤新扎下了根，在废墟低矮荒芜的小土堆上长出了新绿。一扇篱笆门半开着，我推开它走了进去。","There was no house now, no brewery, no building whatever left, but the wall of the old garden.The cleared space had been enclosed with a rough fence, and, looking over it, I saw that some of the old ivy had struck root anew, and was growing green on low quiet mounds of ruin.A gate in the fence standing ajar, I pushed it open, and went in."
"一层清冷的银色的薄雾笼罩着下午的天空，此时月亮还没有升起来把薄雾驱散。不过，星星却透过薄雾放出光芒，月亮升上来了，夜晚显得不那么黑了。我可以回忆起这座宅子每个部分的旧址，哪里是酿酒作坊，哪里是大门，哪里是放酒桶的地方。我回忆着，顺着荒芜的花园小径望去，忽然看见一个孤独的身影。","A cold silvery mist had veiled the afternoon, and the moon was not yet up to scatter it.But, the stars were shining beyond the mist, and the moon was coming, and the evening was not dark.I could trace out where every part of the old house had been, and where the brewery had been, and where the gate, and where the casks.I had done so, and was looking along the desolate garden walk, when I beheld a solitary figure in it."
"我往前走的时候，这个身影也看见了我。这个人也朝我走来，然后站住了，一动不动。我走近了一些，发现这是一个女子。我继续往前走，这个人正要转身离开，突然停住了，等着我靠近。接着，这个人打了个踉跄，似乎受到了惊吓，喊出了我的名字，我也惊叫了一声：","The figure showed itself aware of me, as I advanced.It had been moving towards me, but it stood still.As I drew nearer, I saw it to be the figure of a woman.As I drew nearer yet, it was about to turn away, when it stopped, and let me come up with it.Then, it faltered as if much surprised, and uttered my name, and I cried out:"
"“埃斯特拉！”","“Estella!”"
"“我变了很多。你还认得我，我很惊讶。”","“I am greatly changed.I wonder you know me.”"
"她的确已经不复青春靓丽了，但她那难以言表的端庄和妩媚依旧不减当年。她的魅力我曾经见过，但我从来没有见过的，是她现在的目光。过去她的眼里总是写着骄傲，如今却闪着惨淡而柔和的光。我从来没有感受过的，是她现在的一双手，过去和她握手时感受不到她的情感，现在却感受到了她手中传来的情谊。","The freshness of her beauty was indeed gone, but its indescribable majesty and its indescribable charm remained.Those attractions in it, I had seen before; what I had never seen before, was the saddened softened light of the once proud eyes; what I had never felt before, was the friendly touch of the once insensible hand."
"我们在旁边的一把长椅上坐下了，我说：“这么多年过去了，我们竟然在这里重逢了，多么奇怪呀，埃斯特拉，我们第一次见面就是在这里！你经常回到这里来吗？”","We sat down on a bench that was near, and I said, “After so many years, it is strange that we should thus meet again, Estella, here where our first meeting was!Do you often come back?”"
"“我离开以后再也没有回来过。”","“I have never been here since.”"
"“我也是。”","“Nor I.”"
"月亮在冉冉上升，我想到了那张盯着白色天花板的、平静的脸，那张脸已经消逝了。月亮在冉冉上升，我想到了他把手按在我的手上，倾听我对他说的最后的话。","The moon began to rise, and I thought of the placid look at the white ceiling, which had passed away.The moon began to rise, and I thought of the pressure on my hand when I had spoken the last words he had heard on earth."
"是埃斯特拉打破了我们之间的沉默。","Estella was the next to break the silence that ensued between us."
"“我常常盼望着，也计划着回来看看，但总是由于各种各样事情的阻扰没能实现。我可怜的、可怜的故居！”","“I have very often hoped and intended to come back, but have been prevented by many circumstances.Poor, poor old place!”"
"银色的薄雾和第一缕月光交融在一起，这月光又和她眼中流下的泪水交融在一起。她不知道我看见了她流泪，想控制住自己的泪水，她轻声地说：","The silvery mist was touched with the first rays of the moonlight, and the same rays touched the tears that dropped from her eyes.Not knowing that I saw them, and setting herself to get the better of them, she said quietly:"
"“你一路走来，是不是在想这里怎么会变成这个样子？”","“Were you wondering, as you walked along, how it came to be left in this condition?”"
"“是的，埃斯特拉。”","“Yes, Estella.”"
"“这块地属于我了。这是我唯一保住的财产。其他东西都一样一样地不属于我了，可我保住了这个。这么多年不幸的日子里，这是我唯一坚守住没有放弃的东西。”","“The ground belongs to me.It is the only possession I have not relinquished.Everything else has gone from me, little by little, but I have kept this.It was the subject of the only determined resistance I made in all the wretched years.”"
"“要在这里建房子吗？”","“Is it to be built on?”"
"“会建的。我今天来是想在它改变之前跟它告别。你呢，”她那种关心的语调让我这个流浪的人颇为感动，“你还住在国外吗？”","“At last it is.I came here to take leave of it before its change.And you,” she said, in a voice of touching interest to a wanderer, “you live abroad still?”"
"“还住在国外。”","“Still.”"
"“干得不错吧，我想？”","“And do well, I am sure?”"
"“我卖力工作只是为了维持生计，所以——是的，我干得不错。”","“I work pretty hard for a sufficient living, and therefore—Yes, I do well.”"
"“我常常想起你。”埃斯特拉说。","“I have often thought of you,” said Estella."
"“是吗？”","“Have you?”"
"“特别是最近，常常想起你。我把回忆抛到了脑后，其实我抛掉的是无价之宝，而我却没有意识到它的价值，这是一段漫长而痛苦的时光。不过，我并不是不可以回想过去那一段时光，所以我在心里给它留下了一席之地。”","“Of late, very often.There was a long hard time when I kept far from me, the remembrance, of what I had thrown away when I was quite ignorant of its worth.But, since my duty has not been incompatible with the admission of that remembrance, I have given it a place in my heart.”"
"“你一直在我心里占据着一席之地。”我说。","“You have always held your place in my heart,” I answered."
"我们接下来又是一阵沉默，直到她开口。","And we were silent again, until she spoke."
"“我没想到，”埃斯特拉说，“我来跟这里告别，会赶上和你告别。我很高兴。”","“I little thought,” said Estella, “that I should take leave of you in taking leave of this spot.I am very glad to do so.”"
"“我们又一次分别，你很高兴吗，埃斯特拉？对我来说，分别是一件痛苦的事情。对我来说，只要想起我们上一次的分别，我就哀伤不已、痛苦不已。”","“Glad to part again, Estella?To me, parting is a painful thing.To me, the remembrance of our last parting has been ever mournful and painful.”"
"“可是你对我说过，”埃斯特拉十分认真地说，“‘上帝保佑你，上帝原谅你！’如果你过去可以对我说这样的话，你现在也可以毫不犹豫地对我说——如今，痛苦给我的教训比其他任何教训都要深，它教会了我理解你当时心里的感受。我受尽折磨、肝肠寸断，但是——我希望——我会成为一个更好的人。但你过去就是一个体贴、友善的人，现在还是，请你对我说，我们还是朋友。”","“But you said to me,” returned Estella, very earnestly, “‘God bless you, God forgive you!’And if you could say that to me then, you will not hesitate to say that to me now—now, when suffering has been stronger than all other teaching, and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be.I have been bent and broken, but—I hope—into a better shape.Be as considerate and good to me as you were, and tell me we are friends.”"
"“我们还是朋友。”我说着从长椅上起身，然后弯下身子扶她起来。","“We are friends,” said I, rising and bending over her, as she rose from the bench."
"“我们就算分开，也还是朋友。”埃斯特拉说。","“And will continue friends apart,” said Estella."
"我拉起她的手，一同走出这片废墟。记得多年前我第一次走出铁匠铺的时候，正值晨雾升起之时，而现在夜晚的雾气正在升起，平静的月光笼罩着广袤的大地上的一切，我再也看不到会和她再次分离的阴影。","I took her hand in mine, and we went out of the ruined place; and, as the morning mists had risen long ago when I first left the forge, so, the evening mists were rising now, and in all the broad expanse of tranquil light they showed to me, I saw no shadow of another parting from her."
