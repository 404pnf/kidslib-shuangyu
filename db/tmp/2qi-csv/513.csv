"by Katherine Mansfield","作者：凯瑟琳·曼斯菲尔德"
"The post was very late.","邮差来得很晚。"
"When we came back from our walk after lunch it still had not arrived.","我们午饭后散步回来，邮件还没到。"
"“Pas encore, Madame,” sang Annette, scurrying back to her cooking.","“还没来，太太。”安妮特说着，急忙跑回厨房忙去了。"
"We carried our parcels into the dining-room.","我们带着包裹走进了餐厅。"
"The table was laid.","桌上的餐具已经摆好了。"
"As always, the sight of the table laid for two—for two people only—and yet so finished, so perfect, there was no possible room for a third, gave me a queer, quick thrill as though I’d been struck by that silver lightning that quivered over the white cloth, the brilliant glasses, the shallow bowl of freezias.","和往常一样，桌上只摆了两人的餐具——只有两个人的——却这样齐整，这样完美，没地方再放第三副餐具了；这情景让我一瞬间就有一种怪异的兴奋，我仿佛被那闪烁在白色桌布、晶亮玻璃杯和放仓兰花的浅盘子上的银器的亮光击中了一般。"
"“Blow the old postman!","“老邮差真该打！"
"Whatever can have happened to him?” said Beatrice.","会发生什么事呢？”比阿特丽斯说道，"
"“Put those things down, dearest.”","“把这些东西放下来，亲爱的。”"
"“Where would you like them...?”","“你想把它们搁哪儿……？” "
"She raised her head; she smiled her sweet, teasing smile.","她抬起头，露出那甜美、逗人的笑。"
"“Anywhere—Silly.”","“随便——傻瓜。”"
"But I knew only too well that there was no such place for her, and I would have stood holding the squat liqueur bottle and the sweets for months, for years, rather than risk giving another tiny shock to her exquisite sense of order.","但我非常清楚没有“随便”这样一个地方，我宁愿抱着粗扁的利口酒瓶和糖果站几个月，甚至几年，也不愿冒险（随便放东西）让她敏感的、过分讲究的神经受一丁点儿的刺激。"
"“Here—I’ll take them.”","“嘿——我来放吧。”"
"She plumped them down on the table with her long gloves and a basket of figs.","她把东西连同她的长手套和一篮子无花果一股脑儿地放在桌上。 "
"“The Luncheon Table.","“《午餐桌》。"
"Short story by—by—”","这个短篇小说是谁——谁写的来着？”"
"She took my arm.","她揽住我的胳膊。"
"“Let’s go on to the terrace—” and I felt her shiver.","“我们到阳台去吧——”我感觉到她在颤抖。"
"“Ça sent,” she said faintly, “de la cuisine...”","“那味道，”她无力地说，“从厨房来的味道……”"
"I had noticed lately—we had been living in the south for two months—that when she wished to speak of food, or the climate, or, playfully, of her love for me, she always dropped into French.","我最近才注意到——我们在南方住了两个月了——当她想谈及食物、天气，或者开玩笑般地说起她对我的爱，她总会转说法语。"
"We perched on the balustrade under the awning.","我们在雨棚下的栏杆上坐了下来。"
"Beatrice leaned over gazing down—down to the white road with its guard of cactus spears.","比阿特丽斯俯身朝下张望——望着下面那条白色的路，路边长满仙人掌，像卫队一般。"
"The beauty of her ear, just her ear, the marvel of it was so great that I could have turned from regarding it to all that sweep of glittering sea below and stammered: “You know—her ear!","她的耳朵真美，正是这耳朵，美得出奇，我想转过头，不再盯着她的耳朵，望着下面那片闪光的海，并低声结结巴巴地叹道：“你知道的——她的耳朵！ "
"She has ears that are simply the most...”","她的耳朵简直是最……”"
"She was dressed in white, with pearls round her throat and lilies-of-the-valley tucked into her belt.","她身着白裙，脖子上戴着一串珍珠项链，腰带上系着一束铃兰花。"
"On the third finger of her left hand she wore one pearl ring—no wedding ring.","左手第三指上戴着一枚珍珠戒指——不是婚戒。"
"“Why should I, mon ami?","“为什么我要，我的朋友？"
"Why should we pretend?","为什么我们要假装？"
"Who could possibly care?”","谁会在乎呢？”"
"And of course I agreed, though privately, in the depths of my heart, I would have given my soul to have stood beside her in a large, yes, a large, fashionable church, crammed with people, with old reverend clergymen, with The Voice that breathed o’er Eden, with palms and the smell of scent, knowing there was a red carpet and confetti outside, and somewhere, a wedding-cake and champagne and a satin shoe to throw after the carriage—if I could have slipped our wedding-ring on to her finger.","当然，我得承认，虽然是偷偷地在我内心深处，我仍渴望在一个大大的，是的，一个大大的、体面的教堂里，我站在她的身边，周围挤满了人，有尊敬的老牧师，有婚礼的音乐——伊甸园低语，有棕榈和扑鼻的香味，教堂外铺着红色的地毯，散落着五彩纸屑，有个地方还摆着结婚蛋糕和香槟酒，还有一只向彩车后面抛去的缎面鞋子——要是我能把我们的结婚戒指戴到她手上，出卖灵魂我也愿意。"
"Not because I cared for such horrible shows, but because I felt it might possibly perhaps lessen this ghastly feeling of absolute freedom, her absolute freedom, of course.","并不是我有多喜欢这些讨厌的铺张和排场，只是因为我觉得这样一来，或许可以减轻一些这绝对自由的令人不悦的感觉，当然是她的绝对自由。"
"Oh, God!","哦，上帝啊！"
"What torture happiness was—what anguish!","幸福是一种怎样的折磨啊——多么痛苦！"
"I looked up at the villa, at the windows of our room hidden so mysteriously behind the green straw blinds.","我抬眼望向别墅，看着我们房间的窗口，它是那么神秘地隐藏在绿色的稻草编制的窗帘后面。"
"Was it possible that she ever came moving through the green light and smiling that secret smile, that languid, brilliant smile that was just for me?","有没有可能她会从那绿帘子后面探出头来对我一笑呢？那种神秘、倦怠而又灿烂的笑，只为我一人？"
"She put her arm round my neck; the other hand softly, terribly, brushed back my hair.","她用胳膊搂住我的脖子，另一只手极其温柔地往后拂着我的头发。"
"“Who are you?”","“你是谁?”"
"Who was she?","她是谁？"
"She was—Woman.","她是——女人。"
"...On the first warm evening in Spring, when lights shone like pearls through the lilac air and voices murmured in the fresh-flowering gardens, it was she who sang in the tall house with the tulle curtains.","……春日里第一个暖和的晚上，灯光像珍珠一样穿透丁香般的空气，鲜花初开的花园里声声呢喃，是她在高楼薄纱后浅唱。"
"As one drove in the moonlight through the foreign city hers was the shadow that fell across the quivering gold of the shutters.","当有人驾车在月光下穿越这座异国城市时，落在街边百叶窗上的闪动的金光里的是她的影子。"
"When the lamp was lighted, in the new-born stillness her steps passed your door.","当晚灯亮起时，在新的静寂中，她的脚步经过你的门廊。"
"And she looked out into the autumn twilight, pale in her furs, as the automobile swept by...","她看着窗外秋日暮光，身着毛皮大衣，脸色苍白，当汽车掠过……"
"In fact, to put it shortly, I was twenty-four at the time.","长话短说，事实上，那时我24岁。"
"And when she lay on her back, with the pearls slipped under her chin, and sighed “I’m thirsty, dearest. Donne-moi un orange,” I would gladly, willingly, have dived for an orange into the jaws of a crocodile—if crocodiles ate oranges.","当她仰面躺下，珍珠项链滑到下颚，叹息着喊道“我渴了，亲爱的。给我一个橘子”时，我就会欢天喜地、心甘情愿地恨不得跳进鳄鱼嘴里去取那个橘子——如果鳄鱼吃橘子的话。"
"“Had I two little feathery wings","“倘若我有两只羽翼"
"And were a little feathery bird...” ","倘若我是一只小小的羽翼丰满的鸟……”"
"sang Beatrice.","比阿特丽斯唱着。"
"I seized her hand.","我抓住了她的手。"
"“You wouldn’t fly away?”","“你不会飞走吧？”"
"“Not far.","“不会太远。"
"Not further than the bottom of the road.”","不会飞过路的尽头。”"
"“Why on earth there?”","“为什么是那里呢？”"
"She quoted: “He cometh not, she said...”","她引用道：“他没来，她说……”"
"“Who?","“谁？"
"The silly old postman?","那个愚蠢的邮差？"
"But you’re not expecting a letter.”","但你又不等信。”"
"“No, but it’s maddening all the same. Ah!”","“是的，但是一样令人抓狂。噢！”"
"Suddenly she laughed and leaned against me.","她突然笑了起来，靠在我身上。"
"“There he is—look—like a blue beetle.”","“他在那儿——看——像个蓝色甲壳虫。”"
"And we pressed our cheeks together and watched the blue beetle beginning to climb.","于是我俩脸挨着脸，看着那个蓝甲虫开始爬动。"
"“Dearest,” breathed Beatrice.","“亲爱的。”比阿特丽斯轻轻地叫我。"
"And the word seemed to linger in the air, to throb in the air like the note of a violin.","这呼唤似乎在空中缭绕，像小提琴的琴音余音袅袅。"
"“What is it?”","“什么？”"
"“I don’t know,” she laughed softly.","“不知道，”她轻声笑道，"
"“A wave of—a wave of affection, I suppose.”","“一阵——一阵爱的波动，我想。”"
"I put my arm round her.","我把她揽入怀中。"
"“Then you wouldn’t fly away?”","“那你不会飞走了吧？”"
"And she said rapidly and softly: “No! No!","她又快又轻地答道：“不会的!不会的！"
"Not for worlds.","绝不。"
"Not really.","真的不会。"
"I love this place.","我爱这个地方。"
"I’ve loved being here.","我就喜欢呆在这儿。"
"I could stay here for years, I believe.","我想我能在这儿呆很多年。"
"I’ve never been so happy as I have these last two months, and you’ve been so perfect to me, dearest, in every way.”","我从来没有像过去这两个月这么开心过，无论从哪一方面来说，你对我而言都是如此完美，亲爱的。”"
"This was such bliss—it was so extraordinary, so unprecedented, to hear her talk like this that I had to try to laugh it off.","她这么说让我感觉是如此幸福——这幸福如此难得，前所未有，我不得不试着用笑来打发过去。"
"“Don’t!","“不要！"
"You sound as if you were saying good-bye.”","听起来你像是在道别。”"
"“Oh, nonsense, nonsense.","“哎呀，胡说，胡说。"
"You mustn’t say such things even in fun!”","即使是开玩笑也不许你这么说！”"
"She slid her little hand under my white jacket and clutched my shoulder.","她把小手一伸，伸进了我的白色夹克，抓住了我的肩膀。"
"“You’ve been happy, haven’t you?”","“你已经很幸福了，不是吗？”"
"“Happy? Happy?","“幸福？快乐？"
"Oh, God—if you knew what I feel at this moment...","哦，天啊——要是你能明白我此刻的心情……"
"Happy!","太开心了！"
"My Wonder!","我的奇迹！"
"My Joy!”","我的欣喜！”"
"I dropped off the balustrade and embraced her, lifting her in my arms.","我跳下栏杆抱住了她，把她在我怀里举了起来。"
"And while I held her lifted I pressed my face in her breast and muttered: “You are mine?”","托起她时，我把脸贴在她胸口喃喃地问道：“你是我的吗？”"
"And for the first time in all the desperate months I’d known her, even counting the last month of—surely—Heaven—I believed her absolutely when she answered:","在我认识她的这几个充满绝望的月里，包括最后这个月——我确信是——天堂——的这段时间里，我第一次完完全全地相信了她，当她回答道："
"“Yes, I am yours.”","“是的，我是你的。”"
"The creak of the gate and the postman’s steps on the gravel drew us apart.","门的嘎吱声和石板路上邮差的脚步声分开了我们。"
"I was dizzy for the moment.","有那么一刻，我感到晕晕的。"
"I simply stood there, smiling, I felt, rather stupidly.","我愣愣地站在那里，笑着，感觉相当愚蠢。"
"Beatrice walked over to the cane chairs.","比阿特丽斯走向藤椅。"
"“You go—go for the letters,” said she.","“你去——去拿信。”她说。"
"I—well—I almost reeled away.","我——唉——我几乎是摇晃着过去的。"
"But I was too late.","但我还是太晚了。"
"Annette came running.","安妮特跑了过来。"
"“Pas de lettres” said she.","“没有信。”她说。"
"My reckless smile in reply as she handed me the paper must have surprised her.","她把报纸递给我时，我冲动地笑了起来，这一定让她吃了一惊。"
"I was wild with joy.","我高兴疯了。"
"I threw the paper up into the air and sang out:","我把那报纸往空中一扔，大声喊道："
"“No letters, darling!” as I came over to where the beloved woman was lying in the long chair.","“没有信，亲爱的！”我边喊边走到长椅边，我亲爱的女人正躺在那里。"
"For a moment she did not reply.","她沉默了一会儿。"
"Then she said slowly as she tore off the newspaper wrapper: “The world forgetting, by the world forgot.”","然后她慢慢地说：“世界忘了，被世界遗忘了。”她边说边撕开了报纸的外包装。"
"There are times when a cigarette is just the very one thing that will carry you over the moment.","有些时候，能帮你熬过那一刻的真的只是一根烟。"
"It is more than a confederate, even; it is a secret, perfect little friend who knows all about it and understands absolutely.","它不仅仅是个同伙，更是一个亲密的最佳小伙伴，对一切都了然于胸、明白无误。"
"While you smoke you look down at it—smile or frown, as the occasion demands; you inhale deeply and expel the smoke in a slow fan.","在你抽烟时，你低头看着它——笑着或者皱着眉，视情况而定；你深吸一口，再以一个慢慢的扇形吐出烟雾。"
"This was one of those moments.","目前就是那样的一个时刻。"
"I walked over to the magnolia and breathed my fill of it.","我走到那棵木兰花树前深深吸了一口。"
"Then I came back and leaned over her shoulder.","然后我回来靠在她的肩上。"
"But quickly she tossed the paper away on to the stone.","但很快她把报纸丢在石板地上。"
"“There’s nothing in it,” said she.","“没什么好看的，”她说，"
"“Nothing.","“什么都没有。"
"There’s only some poison trial.","只是一个什么投毒案。"
"Either some man did or didn’t murder his wife, and twenty thousand people have sat in court every day and two million words have been wired all over the world after each proceeding.”","有个男人杀了他的妻子，或者没杀，谁知道呢，于是每天有两万人坐在法庭听审，而每一次庭审后都有二百万字的消息被传向全世界。”"
"“Silly world!” said I, flinging into another chair.","“愚蠢的世界！”我说道，冲到另一张椅子上坐了下来。"
"I wanted to forget the paper, to return, but cautiously, of course, to that moment before the postman came.","我想忘掉报纸而回到，当然是小心谨慎地，回到邮差来之前的那一刻。"
"But when she answered I knew from her voice the moment was over for now.","但她一答话，我就从她的语气里知道，那一刻目前已不复存在。"
"Never mind.","不要紧。"
"I was content to wait—five hundred years, if need be—now that I knew.","我愿意等——五百年，如果需要的话——既然我已经知道了。"
"“Not so very silly,” said Beatrice.","“并不是那么蠢的，”比阿特丽斯说道，"
"“After all it isn’t only morbid curiosity on the part of the twenty thousand.”","“至少这两万人并不是出于病态的好奇。”"
"“What is it, darling?”","“那是什么呢，亲爱的？”"
"Heavens knows I didn’t care.","天知道我并不在乎。"
"“Guilt!” she cried.","“罪过！”她叫道，"
"“Guilt!","“罪过！"
"Didn’t you realise that?","你难道没意识到吗？"
"They’re fascinated like sick people are fascinated by anything—any scrap of news about their own case.","他们对一切都好奇，就像病人对一切——任何有关他们病情的丁点儿消息都好奇一样。"
"The man in the dock may be innocent enough, but the people in court are nearly all of them poisoners.","被告席上的人可能是完全无辜的，而法庭上的群众几乎都是投毒者。"
"Haven’t you ever thought”—she was pale with excitement—“of the amount of poisoning that goes on?","难道你没有想过”——她因为激动而脸色发白——“每天有多少投毒案在发生？"
"It’s the exception to find married people who don’t poison each other—married people and lovers.","毫无例外地（你会）发现已婚的人没有不互相毒害的——那些夫妻们、情人们。"
"Oh,” she cried, “the number of cups of tea, glasses of wine, cups of coffee that are just tainted.","哎，”她叫道，“那么多杯茶，酒和咖啡都是被下了毒的。"
"The number I’ve had myself, and drunk, either knowing or not knowing—and risked it.","无论是知情还是不知情，我自己就曾喝过，冒险过很多次。"
"The only reason why so many couples”—she laughed—“survive, is because the one is frightened of giving the other the fatal dose.","为什么这么多对夫妻能”——她笑道——“幸存，唯一的原因是一方害怕给另一方下致命的药量。"
"That dose takes nerve!","下那一剂狠药需要胆量！"
"But it’s bound to come sooner or later.","但是那一刻或早或晚注定会来的。"
"There’s no going back once the first little dose has been given.","一旦投下第一剂药就回不了头了。"
"It’s the beginning of the end, really—don’t you agree?","它是结束的开始，真的——难道你不认同吗？"
"Don’t you see what I mean?”","难道你不明白我在说什么吗？”"
"She didn’t wait for me to answer.","她根本没等我回答。"
"She unpinned the lilies-of-the-valley and lay back, drawing them across her eyes.","她摘下腰带上的铃兰花躺了回去，拿着那些花在眼前晃着。"
"“Both my husbands poisoned me,” said Beatrice.","“我的两任丈夫都给我下过毒，”比阿特丽斯说道，"
"“My first husband gave me a huge dose almost immediately, but my second was really an artist in his way.","“我的第一任丈夫一次就给我下了很大的剂量，但第二任在这方面真是个艺术家。"
"Just a tiny pinch, now and again, cleverly disguised—Oh, so cleverly!—until one morning I woke up and in every single particle of me, to the ends of my fingers and toes, there was a tiny grain.","仅仅一丁点儿量，一次次地，聪明地伪装着——哦，太聪明了！——直到有天早上我醒来发现，我浑身上下，从指尖到脚尖，到处都被下了点儿药。"
"I was just in time...”","我刚好及时……”"
"I hated to hear her mention her husbands so calmly, especially today.","我很不喜欢听她如此镇定地提起她的丈夫们，特别是今天。"
"It hurt.","这刺痛了我。"
"I was going to speak, but suddenly she cried mournfully:","我正准备开口，她突然悲伤地喊道："
"“Why!","“为什么！ "
"Why should it have happened to me?","为什么会发生在我身上？"
"What have I done?","我做了什么？"
"Why have I been all my life singled out by...","为什么一辈子总是我被挑中……"
"It’s a conspiracy.”","这是个阴谋。”"
"I tried to tell her it was because she was too perfect for this horrible world—too exquisite, too fine.","我试图告诉她那是因为对这个可怕的世界来说她太过完美了——太漂亮，太美好。"
"It frightened people.","这将人们吓跑了。"
"I made a little joke.","我开了个小玩笑。"
"“But I—I haven’t tried to poison you.”","“但是我——我从未打算要毒害你呀。”"
"Beatrice gave a queer small laugh and bit the end of a lily stem.","比阿特丽斯咬着铃兰花茎的一端，露出一丝奇怪的浅笑。"
"“You!” said she.","“你！”她说，"
"“You wouldn’t hurt a fly!”","“你连一只苍蝇都不会伤害！”"
"Strange.","奇怪。"
"That hurt, though.","但那句话让我受伤。"
"Most horribly.","伤得特别厉害。"
"Just then Annette ran out with our apéritifs.","就在那时，安妮特端着饭前开胃酒跑了过来。"
"Beatrice leaned forward and took a glass from the tray and handed it to me.","比阿特丽斯趋身向前从托盘里拿了一杯递给我。"
"I noticed the gleam of the pearl on what I called her pearl finger.","我注意到她那被我称作玉指的手指上珍珠的闪光。"
"How could I be hurt at what she said?","我怎么会被她说的话伤到呢？"
"“And you,” I said, taking the glass, “you’ve never poisoned anybody.”","“而你，”我接过杯子，说道，“你从未给任何人下过毒。”"
"That gave me an idea; I tried to explain.","那让我想起了什么，我试着解释道。"
"“You—you do just the opposite.","“你——你刚好相反。"
"What is the name for one like you who, instead of poisoning people, fills them—everybody, the postman, the man who drives us, our boatman, the flower-seller, me—with new life, with something of her own radiance, her beauty, her—”","该怎么说呢，像你这样的人，非但不会给任何人下毒，反而会给所有人——邮差、给我们赶车的人、船夫、卖花的人，还有我——注入新的生命，以某种生命的光彩、生命的美，生命的……”"
"Dreamily she smiled; dreamily she looked at me.","她梦幻般地笑了；梦幻般地，她看着我。"
"“What are you thinking of—my lovely darling?”","“你在想些什么呢——我可爱的宝贝？”"
"“I was wondering,” she said, “whether, after lunch, you’d go down to the post-office and ask for the afternoon letters.","“我在想，”她说，“午饭后，你是不是愿意去趟邮局取下午的信。"
"Would you mind, dearest?","你愿意吗？最亲爱的？"
"Not that I’m expecting one—but—I just thought, perhaps—it’s silly not to have the letters if they’re there.","并不是我在等一封信——不过——我就是觉得，或许——要是有信来了而不去取就太蠢了。"
"Isn’t it?","不是吗？"
"Silly to wait till tomorrow.”","等到明天去拿就太傻了。”"
"She twirled the stem of the glass in her fingers.","她用手指转动着高脚酒杯的杯脚。"
"Her beautiful head was bent.","她低垂着美丽的头。"
"But I lifted my glass and drank, sipped rather—sipped slowly, deliberately, looking at that dark head and thinking of—postmen and blue beetles and farewells that were not farewells and...","但我举起杯子喝了起来，确切地说，是抿着——慢慢地，故意地抿着，看着她深色的头发，想着——邮差、蓝甲虫以及不是离别的离别，还有……"
"Good God!","上帝啊！"
"Was it fancy?","是幻想吗？"
"No, it wasn’t fancy.","不，不是幻想。"
"The drink tasted chill, bitter, queer.","杯中之物尝起来冰凉、苦涩、怪异。"
