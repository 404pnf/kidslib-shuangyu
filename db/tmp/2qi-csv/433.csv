"Master John Horseleigh, Knight","约翰·霍斯利爵士"
"by Thomas Hardy","作者：托马斯·哈代"
"In the earliest and mustiest volume of the Havenpool marriage registers (said the thin-faced gentleman) this entry may still be read by any one curious enough to decipher the crabbed handwriting of the date.","在黑文普尔婚姻登记处保存的那些年代久远的发霉档案中（那位脸型瘦削的绅士这样说道），这份登记记录或许还会被某些好奇之士读到，因为他们想要辨认出写得字迹潦草的日期。"
"I took a copy of it when I was last there; and it runs thus (he had opened his pocket-book, and now read aloud the extract; afterwards handing round the book to us, wherein we saw transcribed the following)—","上次去的时候我把那个登记记录复印了一份，上面是这样写的（他翻开自己的袖珍本，大声朗读着节选的部分，之后给我们传阅，于是我们就看到了以下这份抄本）——"
"Mastr John Horseleigh, Knyght, of the p’ysshe of Clyffton was maryd to Edith the wyffe late off John Stocker, m’chawnte of Havenpool the xiiij daje of December be p’vylegge gevyn by our sup’me hedd of the chyrche of Ingelonde Kynge Henry the viii th 1539.","克莱弗顿的约翰·霍斯利爵士与黑文普尔商人约翰·斯托克的遗孀伊迪丝于1539年12月13日成婚，婚礼得到了英国国教最高领袖——国王亨利八世给予的特殊优待。"
"Now, if you turn to the long and elaborate pedigree of the ancient family of the Horseleighs of Clyfton Horseleigh, you will find no mention whatever of this alliance, notwithstanding the privilege given by the Sovereign and head of the Church; the said Sir John being therein chronicled as marrying, at a date apparently earlier than the above, the daughter and heiress of Richard Phelipson, of Montislope, in Nether Wessex, a lady who outlived him, of which marriage there were issue two daughters and a son, who succeeded him in his estates.","如今，如果你去翻阅克莱弗顿·霍斯利的霍斯利家族那冗长详尽的族谱，你会发现没有这桩联姻的记录，尽管婚礼得到了时任国教领袖的君主给予的特权。至于其中提及的约翰爵士，族谱记录着他在某个明显早于那个日期的日子，与蒙蒂斯洛普的理查德·菲利普森的女儿暨继承人在南威塞克斯成婚。这位女士比他更加长寿，婚后他们有了两个女儿和一个儿子，儿子后来继承了他的家产。"
"How are we to account for these, as it would seem, contemporaneous wives?","我们该如何解释这两位似乎同时存在的妻子？"
"A strange local tradition only can help us, and this can be briefly told.","只有当地一个离奇的传说能够帮助我们，而且这个传说可以简单地讲清楚。"
"One evening in the autumn of the year 1540 or 1541, a young sailor, whose Christian name was Roger, but whose surname is not known, landed at his native place of Havenpool, on the South Wessex coast, after a voyage in the Newfoundland trade, then newly sprung into existence.","1540或是1541年秋天的一个晚上，一位年轻的水手完成到纽芬兰的贸易航行后，在南威塞克斯海岸登陆，抵达他的家乡黑文普尔，重新出现在众人面前。他的教名是罗杰，但姓氏不为人知。"
"He returned in the ship Primrose with a cargo of ‘trayne oyle brought home from the New Founde Lande,’ to quote from the town records of the date.","他跟随“普里姆罗斯”号返回，船上载着一批货物，根据镇上对当时情况的记录，那是“从纽芬兰带回家乡的鲸油”。"
"During his absence of two summers and a winter, which made up the term of a Newfoundland ‘spell,’ many unlooked-for changes had occurred within the quiet little seaport, some of which closely affected Roger the sailor.","他离开家乡已有两个夏季和一个冬季，这在纽芬兰构成所谓的“一轮”。这个安静的小海港在这段时间里发生了很多没有预料到的变化，其中一些对水手罗杰产生了密切的影响。"
"At the time of his departure his only sister Edith had become the bride of one Stocker, a respectable townsman, and part owner of the brig in which Roger had sailed; and it was to the house of this couple, his only relatives, that the young man directed his steps.","他离家时，唯一的姐姐伊迪丝已经嫁到了斯托克家，姐夫是个正派的镇民，也是罗杰之前所乘商船的共有人。这位年轻人正是向着这对夫妇——也是他唯一的亲人——家里走去。"
"On trying the door in Quay Street he found it locked, and then observed that the windows were boarded up.","他敲了敲码头路上姐姐家的门，发现门锁着，窗户都用木板封住了。"
"Inquiring of a bystander, he learnt for the first time of the death of his brother-in-law, though that event had taken place nearly eighteen months before.","他向旁人打听了一下，第一次获知了姐夫的死讯，尽管这件事发生在大约18个月之前。"
"‘And my sister Edith?’ asked Roger.","“那我的姐姐伊迪丝呢？”罗杰问。"
"‘She’s married again—as they do say, and hath been so these twelve months.","“她改嫁了——他们是这么说的，过去12个月里都是这么说的。"
"I don’t vouch for the truth o’t, though if she isn’t she ought to be.’","我不敢保证是真的，但如果她不再是过去那个样子我就不好说了。”"
"Roger’s face grew dark.","罗杰的脸色变得沉重起来。"
"He was a man with a considerable reserve of strong passion, and he asked his informant what he meant by speaking thus.","他是个非常能够压抑强烈情绪的人，于是他问向他透露消息的那人，这么说是什么意思。"
"The man explained that shortly after the young woman’s bereavement a stranger had come to the port.","那人解释说，那个年轻女人丧偶后不久，一个陌生人就来到了港口。"
"He had seen her moping on the quay, had been attracted by her youth and loneliness, and in an extraordinarily brief wooing had completely fascinated her—had carried her off, and, as was reported, had married her.","他看到她在码头上黯然神伤，被那种年轻和孤寂吸引，以闪电般的追求攻势彻底迷住了她——使她为其倾倒；之后就像传说中的那样，与她结婚了。"
"Though he had come by water, he was supposed to live no very great distance off by land.","尽管他由水路过来，但估计走陆路距离也不太远。"
"They were last heard of at Oozewood, in Upper Wessex, at the house of one Wall, a timber-merchant, where, he believed, she still had a lodging, though her husband, if he were lawfully that much, was but an occasional visitor to the place.","他们最后出现的地方据说是北威塞克斯的伍兹伍德，在一个叫沃尔的木材商家里。那人相信，她在那里还有一处居所，尽管她的丈夫——假如他的确是伊迪丝的合法丈夫——只是偶尔才会去那里。"
"‘The stranger?’ asked Roger.","“那个陌生人，”罗杰问道，"
"‘Did you see him?","“你看到他了吗？"
"What manner of man was he?’","他是哪一种人？”"
"‘I liked him not,’ said the other.","“我不喜欢他，”那人说道，"
"‘He seemed of that kind that hath something to conceal, and as he walked with her he ever and anon turned his head and gazed behind him, as if he much feared an unwelcome pursuer.","“他看上去像那种有所隐瞒的人，和她走在一起时，他会时不时地转头看看身后，好像怕有人跟踪。"
"But, faith,’ continued he, ‘it may have been the man’s anxiety only.","但是说实在的，”他继续说道，“他可能只是焦虑而已。"
"Yet did I not like him.’","但我确实不喜欢他。”"
"‘Was he older than my sister?’","“他比我姐姐年纪大吗？”"
" Roger asked.","罗杰问道。"
"‘Ay—much older; from a dozen to a score of years older.","“唉——大多了，大个12到20岁的样子。"
"A man of some position, maybe, playing an amorous game for the pleasure of the hour.","可能是个有些地位的男人，为了一时之欢，玩些浪漫多情的把戏。"
"Who knoweth but that he have a wife already?","谁知道他是不是已经有妻子了？"
"Many have done the thing hereabouts of late.’","近来这一带很多人都干过这种事情。”"
"Having paid a visit to the graves of his relatives, the sailor next day went along the straight road which, then a lane, now a highway, conducted to the curious little inland town named by the Havenpool man.","去亲人的墓前拜祭后，水手第二天便上路了。那条路时窄时宽，直达黑文普尔人提到的那个奇特的内陆小镇。"
"It is unnecessary to describe Oozewood on the South-Avon.","南埃文的伍兹伍德镇没什么值得描述的。"
"It has a railway at the present day; but thirty years of steam traffic past its precincts have hardly modified its original features.","如今它有一条铁路了。蒸汽机车曾穿行于小镇30年，却几乎没有改变它最初的样子。"
"Surrounded by a sort of fresh-water lagoon, dividing it from meadows and coppice, its ancient thatch and timber houses have barely made way even in the front street for the ubiquitous modern brick and slate.","小镇由小淡水湖环绕，湖水将其与草甸和灌木丛隔开，过去的茅草房和木屋使得前街都没地方铺设现代的砖块和石板，尽管这些如今随处可见。"
"It neither increases nor diminishes in size; it is difficult to say what the inhabitants find to do, for, though trades in woodware are still carried on, there cannot be enough of this class of work nowadays to maintain all the householders, the forests around having been so greatly thinned and curtailed.","它的面积既无扩张也无缩减。当地居民做什么活计很难说，因为尽管木制品交易还在进行，如今周围的森林资源却已经大幅度减少，这类买卖已不够让每户人家都维持生计了。"
"At the time of this tradition the forests were dense, artificers in wood abounded, and the timber trade was brisk.","流行这种买卖的时候，森林还很茂密，木匠人数众多，木材交易很兴盛。"
"Every house in the town, without exception, was of oak framework, filled in with plaster, and covered with thatch, the chimney being the only brick portion of the structure.","镇上的每栋房子无一例外都是橡木构架，填充灰泥，再搭上茅草，烟囱是房子上唯一由砖头搭建的部分。"
"Inquiry soon brought Roger the sailor to the door of Wall, the timber-dealer referred to, but it was some time before he was able to gain admission to the lodging of his sister, the people having plainly received directions not to welcome strangers.","经过一番询问，水手罗杰很快找到了之前提及的那个木材商沃尔的家门口，但获准进入姐姐的住所还是花费了些时间。因为守门人得到过明确指示，不欢迎陌生人。"
"She was sitting in an upper room on one of the lath-backed, willow-bottomed ‘shepherd’s’ chairs, made on the spot then as to this day, and as they were probably made there in the days of the Heptarchy.","她正坐在楼上房间一个有着板条靠背、柳木底座的牧羊人座椅上。在今天看来，座椅是当时就地取材做的，又好像是在七国联盟时期做的。"
"In her lap was an infant, which she had been suckling, though now it had fallen asleep; so had the young mother herself for a few minutes, under the drowsing effects of solitude.","她膝上躺着个婴儿，刚喂过奶，现在已经睡着了。因此，在孤独带来的困倦感中，年轻母亲有了几分钟属于自己的时间，小憩了一会儿。"
"Hearing footsteps on the stairs, she awoke, started up with a glad cry, and ran to the door, opening which she met her brother on the threshold.","听到楼梯上传来脚步声，她醒了过来，欣喜地叫了一声，跳了起来，奔向门口，打开门后发现是弟弟站在门外。"
"‘O, this is merry; I didn’t expect ’ee!’ she said.","“哦，真是件高兴事，我没想到会是你！”她说道，"
"‘Ah, Roger—I thought it was John.’","“啊，罗杰——我还以为是约翰呢。”"
"Her tones fell to disappointment.","她的语调变得失望下来。"
"The sailor kissed her, looked at her sternly for a few moments, and pointing to the infant, said, ‘You mean the father of this?’","水手吻了她一下，严肃地盯着她看了一会儿，指着那个婴儿问道：“你是说孩子的父亲？”"
"‘Yes, my husband,’ said Edith.","“是的，我的丈夫。”伊迪丝说。"
"‘I hope so,’ he answered.","“我希望是这样子的。”他回答道。"
"‘Why, Roger, I’m married—of a truth am I!’ she cried.","“哎呀，罗杰，我结婚了——真的结婚了！”她喊道。"
"‘Shame upon ’ee, if true!","“如果是真的，那真是丢脸！"
"If not true, worse.","如果不是真的，那就更糟了。"
"Master Stocker was an honest man, and ye should have respected his memory longer.","斯托克少爷是个正直的人，你应该多缅怀他一段时间的。"
"Where is thy husband?’","你丈夫呢？”"
"‘He comes often.","“他经常过来。"
"I thought it was he now.","我刚才就以为是他。"
"Our marriage has to be kept secret for a while—it was done privily for certain reasons; but we was married at church like honest folk—afore God we were, Roger, six months after poor Stocker’s death.’","我们的婚姻必须保密一段时间——这是有一定原因的；但我们和其他正派人士一样，是在教堂结婚的——在上帝的见证下，罗杰，那是在可怜的斯托克死后六个月。”"
"‘’Twas too soon,’ said Roger.","“那也太快了。”罗杰说道。"
"‘I was living in a house alone; I had nowhere to go to.","“我独自生活在一栋房子里，无处可去。"
"You were far over sea in the New Found Land, and John took me and brought me here.’","你又在纽芬兰，远在海外，是约翰收留了我，把我带到这儿。”"
"‘How often doth he come?’ says Roger again.","“他多长时间过来一次？”罗杰又问道。"
"‘Once or twice weekly,’ says she.","“每周一到两次。”她回答说。"
"‘I wish th’ ’dst waited till I returned, dear Edy,’ he said.","“我希望你当时能等到我回来，亲爱的伊迪丝。”他说，"
"‘It mid be you are a wife—I hope so.","“你可能是一位妻子——我希望如此。"
"But, if so, why this mystery?","但如果是这样的话，为什么要这么神秘？"
"Why this mean and cramped lodging in this lonely copse-circled town?","为什么要来这个灌木丛环绕的偏僻小镇，住在这么简陋狭窄的地方？"
"Of what standing is your husband, and of where?’","你丈夫是什么身份？家是哪儿的？”"
"‘He is of gentle breeding—his name is John.","“他出身高贵——名叫约翰。"
"I am not free to tell his family-name.","我不方便透露他的姓氏。"
"He is said to be of London, for safety’ sake; but he really lives in the county next adjoining this.’","外面传言说他在伦敦，这是出于安全的考虑，实际上他就住在毗邻此地的那个郡。”"
"‘Where in the next county?’","“在那个郡的具体哪个地方？”"
"‘I do not know.","“我不清楚。"
"He has preferred not to tell me, that I may not have the secret forced from me, to his and my hurt, by bringing the marriage to the ears of his kinsfolk and friends.’","他选择不告诉我，这样就不会有人来逼迫我说出这个秘密，再将这桩婚事捅到他亲戚朋友那儿，伤害到他和我自己。”"
"Her brother’s face flushed.","她弟弟的脸涨得通红。"
"‘Our people have been honest townsmen, well-reputed for long; why should you readily take such humbling from a sojourner of whom th’ ‘st know nothing?’","“咱们家都是正派人，一向名声很好，为什么你就乐意这么卑贱地接受一个我们一无所知、只是偶尔寄居在这里的人呢？”"
"They remained in constrained converse till her quick ear caught a sound, for which she might have been waiting—a horse’s footfall.","他们一直这样别扭地交谈着，直到耳尖的伊迪丝听到外边有动静，而这动静可能就是她一直在等待的——马蹄声。"
"‘It is John!’ said she.","“是约翰！”她喊道，"
"‘This is his night—Saturday.’","“这个晚上属于他——星期六。”"
"‘Don’t be frightened lest he should find me here!’ said Roger.","“别慌，免得让他发现我在这儿，”罗杰说道，"
"‘I am on the point of leaving.","“我正要走。"
"I wish not to be a third party.","我可不想介入你们中间。"
"Say nothing at all about my visit, if it will incommode you so to do.","如果有什么不方便的话，就别提到我来过。"
"I will see thee before I go afloat again.’","下次出海之前我会再来看你的。”"
"Speaking thus he left the room, and descending the staircase let himself out by the front door, thinking he might obtain a glimpse of the approaching horseman.","说完他就离开房间，下楼从前门走了出去，心想说不定还可以瞥见骑马过来的那人。"
"But that traveller had in the meantime gone stealthily round to the back of the homestead, and peering along the pinion-end of the house Roger discerned him unbridling and haltering his horse with his own hands in the shed there.","但那人这会儿的功夫就悄悄掉了个头，骑到屋后，沿着房屋一侧的尽头四处窥探。罗杰看到他在棚屋那里自己卸下马的辔头，又套上缰绳。"
"Roger retired to the neighbouring inn called the Black Lamb, and meditated.","罗杰回到附近一家叫做“黑羔羊”的客栈里，一边沉思着。"
"This mysterious method of approach determined him, after all, not to leave the place till he had ascertained more definite facts of his sister’s position—whether she were the deluded victim of the stranger or the wife she obviously believed herself to be.","这种神秘的到来方式让他最终决定先不离开这里，直到弄清楚姐姐的处境——她到底是被这个陌生人欺骗的受害者，还是她自认为的正牌妻子。"
"Having eaten some supper, he left the inn, it being now about eleven o’clock.","吃过些晚餐后，大概11点钟的时候，他离开了客栈。"
"He first looked into the shed, and, finding the horse still standing there, waited irresolutely near the door of his sister’s lodging.","他先看了看棚屋，发现马还在，然后在姐姐住处的大门旁犹犹豫豫地等待着。"
"Half an hour elapsed, and, while thinking he would climb into a loft hard by for a night’s rest, there seemed to be a movement within the shutters of the sitting-room that his sister occupied.","半个小时过去了，他正想着自己是不是该爬到附近的阁楼去歇息一晚上，突然，姐姐房间的百叶窗似乎动了一下。"
"Roger hid himself behind a faggot-stack near the back door, rightly divining that his sister’s visitor would emerge by the way he had entered.","罗杰藏身到后门附近的柴把堆后，准确地猜测到姐姐的访客会沿进屋的路出来。"
"The door opened, and the candle she held in her hand lighted for a moment the stranger’s form, showing it to be that of a tall and handsome personage, about forty years of age, and apparently of a superior position in life.","门开了，她手举蜡烛，烛光一时映射出了陌生人的身形。他身材高大，相貌英俊，40岁左右，显然来自上流社会。"
"Edith was assisting him to cloak himself, which being done he took leave of her with a kiss and left the house.","伊迪丝帮他穿上斗篷，之后他向她吻别，便出了门。"
"From the door she watched him bridle and saddle his horse, and having mounted and waved an adieu to her as she stood candle in hand, he turned out of the yard and rode away.","她在门口处望着男子给马勒上缰绳、装上马鞍。她手举蜡烛站在那里，而他跃上马背，向伊迪丝挥手告别后，便掉头骑出院子走远了。"
"The horse which bore him was, or seemed to be, a little lame, and Roger fancied from this that the rider’s journey was not likely to be a long one.","他骑的马有点儿跛，至少看上去是这样的。罗杰由此推测，骑马人的行程应该不长。"
"Being light of foot he followed apace, having no great difficulty on such a still night in keeping within earshot some few miles, the horseman pausing more than once.","他轻手轻脚地快步跟了上去。在这样一个寂静的夜晚，要听到几英里范围内的动静不是什么难事。骑马人在途中停歇了好几次。"
"In this pursuit Roger discovered the rider to choose bridle-tracks and open commons in preference to any high road.","在追赶的过程中，罗杰发现，比起宽广的大路，骑马人更喜欢马道以及开阔的公地。"
"The distance soon began to prove a more trying one than he had bargained for; and when out of breath and in some despair of being able to ascertain the man’s identity, he perceived an ass standing in the starlight under a hayrick, from which the animal was helping itself to periodic mouthfuls.","很快，罗杰发现行程比自己预想的更为艰难。就在他上气不接下气、对自己能否搞清楚那人的身份有点儿绝望时，他发现，星光中，一头毛驴正立在草垛下，时不时往草垛咬上一口。"
"The story goes that Roger caught the ass, mounted, and again resumed the trail of the unconscious horseman, which feat may have been possible to a nautical young fellow, though one can hardly understand how a sailor would ride such an animal without bridle or saddle, and strange to his hands, unless the creature were extraordinarily docile.","事情是这样发展的，罗杰抓住驴子骑了上去，重新寻到了毫无察觉的骑马人的踪迹。这样的骑术对一个航海的年轻人来说还是有可能达到的，尽管人们很难理解一个水手既没缰绳又没鞍座，要怎样骑一头陌生驴子，除非这小东西格外温顺。"
"This question, however, is immaterial.","然而，这个问题无关紧要。"
"Suffice it to say that at dawn the following morning Roger beheld his sister’s lover or husband entering the gates of a large and well-timbered park on the south-western verge of the White Hart Forest (as it was then called), now known to everybody as the Vale of Blackmoor.","总之，第二天黎明时分，罗杰看到姐姐的情人，或者说是丈夫，骑马进入了白雄鹿森林（当时是叫这个名字）西南边那个树木繁茂的大公园里，而白雄鹿森林就是现在大家都知道的黑沼泽河谷。"
"Thereupon the sailor discarded his steed, and finding for himself an obscurer entrance to the same park a little further on, he crossed the grass to reconnoitre.","于是水手扔下自己的坐骑，找到公园不远处一个更为隐蔽的入口，他穿过草地进行追踪。"
"He presently perceived amid the trees before him a mansion which, new to himself, was one of the best known in the county at that time.","躲在树丛间，他很快意识到自己前方那栋从未见过的大宅子当时在郡里可是最有名气的。"
"Of this fine manorial residence hardly a trace now remains; but a manuscript dated some years later than the events we are regarding describes it in terms from which the imagination may construct a singularly clear and vivid picture.","这栋雅致的庄园宅邸如今毫无踪迹可寻，但在我们谈及的这件事发生若干年后，一份手稿记录了这栋宅邸的情况。根据其中的描述，人们可以在脑海中勾勒出一幅非常清晰生动的画面。"
"This record presents it as consisting of ‘a faire yellow freestone building, partly two and partly three storeys; a faire halle and parlour, both waynscotted; a faire dyning roome and withdrawing roome, and many good lodgings; a kitchen adjoyninge backwarde to one end of the dwelling-house, with a faire passage from it into the halle, parlour, and dyninge roome, and sellars adjoyninge.","根据手稿的描述，它是“一栋淡黄色的毛石建筑，有些部分是两层的，还有些部分是三层的；门厅和客厅很气派，都用护壁板进行了装饰；有一间餐厅和一间休息室以及众多舒适的公寓房间；厨房背临宅邸的一侧，有一条宽敞的过道由厨房通向门厅、客厅与餐厅，附近就是酒窖。”"
"‘In the front of the house a square greene court, and a curious gatehouse with lodgings in it, standing with the front of the house to the south; in a large outer court three stables, a coach-house, a large barne, and a stable for oxen and kyne, and all houses necessary.","“房前是一个方形庭院，碧草如茵，门房建得有些怪异，可以住宿，就在房子南边的前方；大大的外院里有三间马厩、一间马车房、一个大谷仓，还有一间牛棚，各种屋舍应有尽有。"
"‘Without the gatehouse, paled in, a large square greene, in which standeth a faire chappell; of the south-east side of the greene court, towards the river, a large garden.","“在门房外面由栅栏围着一大片方形草坪，一座漂亮的教堂就屹立在草坪中间；绿意盎然的庭院里，东南侧有个大花园正对河流。"
"‘Of the south-west side of the greene court is a large bowling greene, with fower mounted walks about it, all walled about with a batteled wall, and sett with all sorts of fruit; and out of it into the feildes there are large walks under many tall elmes orderly planted.’","“庭院的西南侧是个大型草地保龄球场，球场周围的小径间种着花花草草，外围由筑有城垛的围墙围住，还种着各种水果；围墙之外的场地里整齐地种着许多高大的榆树，宽阔的走道纵横其间。"
"Then follows a description of the orchards and gardens; the servants’ offices, brewhouse, bakehouse, dairy, pigeon-houses, and corn-mill; the river and its abundance of fish; the warren, the coppices, the walks; ending thus—","文章接着描述了果园和花园以及仆人房、酿酒室、烘焙房、牛奶房、鸽舍和谷物磨坊；对渔产丰富的河流、养兔场、灌木林和条条走道也都有相应的描述；最后是这样结尾的——"
"‘And all the country north of the house, open champaign, sandy feildes, very dry and pleasant for all kindes of recreation, huntinge, and hawkinge, and profitble for tillage...","“宅子北部的整个乡村都是空旷的原野和沙地，非常干燥，适合各类休闲、狩猎和带鹰出猎的活动，用于耕种收成也很好……"
"The house hath a large prospect east, south, and west, over a very large and pleasant vale...is seated from the good markett towns of Sherton Abbas three miles, and Ivel a mile, that plentifully yield all manner of provision; and within twelve miles of the south sea.’","宅子的东、南、西侧视野宽广，可以一览大溪谷的美丽景致……它坐落于距离集市贸易兴盛的舍顿-阿巴斯镇三英里的地方，距离艾夫尔镇一英里，而艾夫尔镇盛产各种生活必需品。从宅子到南边的海有12英里。”"
"It was on the grass before this seductive and picturesque structure that the sailor stood at gaze under the elms in the dim dawn of Sunday morning, and saw to his surprise his sister’s lover and horse vanish within the court of the building.","就是在这栋别致迷人的建筑前的草地上，周日清晨微弱的曙光中，水手一直站在榆树下注视着里面的情形。他惊奇地发现姐姐的情人连同马匹一起消失在了大宅的院子里。"
"Perplexed and weary, Roger slowly retreated, more than ever convinced that something was wrong in his sister’s position.","罗杰感到既困惑又疲惫，于是慢慢退了出来，他越发确定姐姐的处境不正常。"
"He crossed the bowling green to the avenue of elms, and, bent on further research, was about to climb into one of these, when, looking below, he saw a heap of hay apparently for horses or deer.","他穿过草地保龄球场，走上榆树林立的大道，决意一探究竟。当他准备爬上一棵树时，他向下看了看，发现底下有一堆干草，显然是为马匹或鹿准备的。"
"Into this he crept, and, having eaten a crust of bread which he had hastily thrust into his pocket at the inn, he curled up and fell asleep, the hay forming a comfortable bed, and quite covering him over.","他悄悄爬进干草堆，吃了片干面包，这还是在客栈时他匆忙塞进兜里的。然后他蜷起身子睡着了，干草堆成了舒适的床铺，将他完全覆盖住。"
"He slept soundly and long, and was awakened by the sound of a bell.","他沉沉地睡了很久，直到被一阵钟声吵醒。"
"On peering from the hay he found the time had advanced to full day; the sun was shining brightly.","从干草堆向外窥去，他发现天已大亮，阳光十分灿烂。"
"The bell was that of the ‘faire chappell’ on the green outside the gatehouse, and it was calling to matins.","钟声是从门房外草坪中央的那座宏伟教堂里传出来的，呼唤人们进行晨祷。"
"Presently the priest crossed the green to a little side-door in the chancel, and then from the gateway of the mansion emerged the household, the tall man whom Roger had seen with his sister on the previous night, on his arm being a portly dame, and, running beside the pair, two little girls and a boy.","不久，牧师便穿过草地走到高坛的小侧门处，主人一家随后从宅子的大门里走了出来，其中就有前一天晚上罗杰看到与姐姐在一起的那名高个男子。一位体态丰腴的女士挽着他的胳膊，在他俩旁边还跑着两个小女孩和一个男孩。"
"These all entered the chapel, and the bell having ceased and the environs become clear, the sailor crept out from his hiding.","他们都走进了教堂，钟声已经停止，四周变得一片寂静，水手从藏身处爬了出来。"
"He sauntered towards the chapel, the opening words of the service being audible within.","他朝着教堂的方向溜达过去，能听得见人们祷告开篇的声音。"
"While standing by the porch he saw a belated servitor approaching from the kitchen-court to attend the service also.","他站在门廊那里，看见一个迟到的仆人正从厨房的院子那边赶来，也是要参加祷告。"
"Roger carelessly accosted him, and asked, as an idle wanderer, the name of the family he had just seen cross over from the mansion.","罗杰装作打发时间地闲逛，不经意地和他搭话，向他问起自己刚才看见从宅子里出来的这家人的姓名。"
"‘Od zounds! if ye modden be a stranger here in very truth, goodman.","“哎呀！您一定是外地人吧，先生。"
"That wer Sir John and his dame, and his children Elizabeth, Mary, and John.’","那是约翰爵士和他夫人，还有他的几个孩子，伊丽莎白、玛丽和约翰。”"
"‘I be from foreign parts.","“我是外地来的。"
"Sir John what d’ye call’n?’","约翰爵士的全名是什么？”"
"‘Master John Horseleigh, Knight, who had a’most as much lond by inheritance of his mother as ‘a had by his father, and likewise some by his wife.","“约翰·霍斯利爵士，他从他母亲那里继承的田产几乎和从他父亲那里继承的一样多，另外还有些土地来自他夫人。"
"Why, bain’t his arms dree goolden horses’ heads, and idden his lady the daughter of Master Richard Phelipson, of Montislope, in Nether Wessex, known to us all?’","嗨，他手上牵的都是名贵的马匹。夫人是理查德·菲利普森爵士的女儿，南威塞克斯的蒙蒂斯洛普来的，这些咱们都听说过吧？”"
"‘It mid be so, and yet it mid not.","“可能是这样，但也可能不是。"
"However, th’ ‘lt miss thy prayers for such an honest knight’s welfare, and I have to traipse seaward many miles.’","不过，这样一个正直的爵士，为他祈福的祷告仪式你可不能错过，我得往海边赶路了，路可不近呢。”"
"He went onward, and as he walked continued saying to himself, ‘Now to that poor wronged fool Edy.","他动身向前走，边走边不断自言自语：“现在该去可怜的伊迪丝那儿了，她这个被人愚弄的傻瓜。"
"The fond thing!","这个痴情的人！"
"I thought it; ’twas too quick—she was ever amorous.","我就知道，这太快了——她一直就是那么多情。"
"What’s to become of her!","她会变成什么样呢！"
"God wot!","天晓得！"
"How be I going to face her with the news, and how be I to hold it from her?","带着这个消息，我该如何面对她？又或是向她隐瞒？"
"To bring this disgrace on my father’s honoured name, a double-tongued knave!’","这样耻辱的事情会玷污父亲的好名声，这个两面三刀的流氓！”"
"He turned and shook his fist at the chapel and all in it, and resumed his way.","他转过身来，满是怒气地朝教堂挥了挥拳头，便继续上了路。"
"Perhaps it was owing to the perplexity of his mind that, instead of returning by the direct road towards his sister’s obscure lodging in the next county, he followed the highway to Casterbridge, some fifteen miles off, where he remained drinking hard all that afternoon and evening, and where he lay that and two or three succeeding nights, wandering thence along the Anglebury road to some village that way, and lying the Friday night after at his native place of Havenpool.","或许是因为头脑混乱，他没走那条直达姐姐隐秘住所的路返回另一个郡，而是循大路到了大约15英里外的卡斯特桥，整个下午和晚上都在那里酗酒。之后的两三个晚上他一直呆在那里，又从那里启程，沿着安格尔伯里路一路游荡，途经路上的某个小镇，终于于周五晚上回到了他的家乡黑文普尔。"
"The sight of the familiar objects there seems to have stirred him anew to action, and the next morning he was observed pursuing the way to Oozewood that he had followed on the Saturday previous, reckoning, no doubt, that Saturday night would, as before, be a time for finding Sir John with his sister again.","触目所及那些熟悉的事物似乎又激起了他行进的动力。第二天早晨就有人看见他踏上了去往伍兹伍德的路，就是上周六他走过的那条。他推断，周六晚上肯定会撞见约翰爵士与姐姐相会，就像上次一样。"
"He delayed to reach the place till just before sunset.","他一直拖到将近日落时才抵达那里。"
"His sister was walking in the meadows at the foot of the garden, with a nursemaid who carried the baby, and she looked up pensively when he approached.","姐姐正在花园一角的草坪上散步，保姆在一旁抱着小婴儿。罗杰走近时，她忧郁地抬头看了看。"
"Anxiety as to her position had already told upon her once rosy cheeks and lucid eyes.","对自身处境的焦虑已然写在了她那曾经红润的脸颊上和曾经清澈的眼神中。"
"But concern for herself and child was displaced for the moment by her regard of Roger’s worn and haggard face.","但看到罗杰疲惫憔悴的面容，她对自己和孩子的担忧在那一刻被对罗杰的关切所取代。"
"‘Why—you are sick, Roger—you are tired!","“哎呀——你生病了，罗杰——你很累！"
"Where have you been these many days?","这么多天你去哪儿了？"
"Why not keep me company a bit—my husband is much away?","为什么不稍微陪陪我——我丈夫经常不在呀。"
"And we have hardly spoke at all of dear father and of your voyage to the New Land.","而且我们都没怎么聊起亲爱的父亲，还有你去纽芬兰的旅程。"
"Why did you go away so suddenly?","你为什么走得这么突然？"
"There is a spare chamber at my lodging.’","我的住处还有个空房间。”"
"‘Come indoors,’ he said.","“进屋吧，”他说道，"
"‘We’ll talk now—talk a good deal.","“我们现在谈谈——好好谈谈。"
"As for him [nodding to the child], better heave him into the river; better for him and you!’","至于他（他朝孩子点了点头），最好扔到河里去，这样对你俩都好！”"
"She forced a laugh, as if she tried to see a good joke in the remark, and they went silently indoors.","她强作笑颜，似乎想努力从这番话中解读出一个好笑的笑话来。两人一起沉默着进了屋。"
"‘A miserable hole!’ said Roger, looking round the room.","“真是个可悲的地方！”罗杰说道，一边环视房间。"
"‘Nay, but ’tis very pretty!’","“是，但这儿很漂亮！”"
"‘Not after what I’ve seen.","“跟我看过的那宅子比就不怎么样了。"
"Did he marry ’ee at church in orderly fashion?’","他有没有按照一般礼数在教堂与你成婚？”"
"‘He did sure—at our church at Havenpool.’","“当然有——就在我们黑文普尔的教堂。”"
"‘But in a privy way?’","“但却是私底下举行的？”"
"‘Ay—because of his friends—it was at night-time.’","“唉——因为他朋友的关系——当时是在晚上。”"
"‘Ede, ye fond one—for all that he’s not thy husband!","“伊迪丝，你爱的人——虽然如此，他不是你的丈夫！"
"Th’ ’rt not his wife; and the child is a bastard.","你不是他的妻子，这孩子是个私生子。"
"He hath a wife and children of his own rank, and bearing his name; and that’s Sir John Horseleigh, of Clyfton Horseleigh, and not plain Jack, as you think him, and your lawful husband.","他有个妻子，还有和他地位同样显贵的孩子，他们承袭了他的名字。他是克莱弗顿·霍斯利的约翰·霍斯利爵士，他不是普通人，也不是像你想的那样，是你的合法丈夫。"
"The sacrament of marriage is no safeguard nowadays.","婚姻的誓言如今已经不是什么保障了。"
"The King’s new-made headship of the Church hath led men to practise these tricks lightly.’","国王重新规定了教会的权力，这使得男人们开始轻而易举地玩弄这些把戏。”"
"She had turned white.","她的脸色变得苍白。"
"‘That’s not true, Roger!’ she said.","“那不是真的，罗杰！”她喊道，"
"‘You are in liquor, my brother, and you know not what you say!","“你喝醉了，我的弟弟，你不知道自己在说什么！"
"Your seafaring years have taught ’ee bad things!’","出海的这些年让你变坏了！”"
"‘Edith—I’ve seen them; wife and family—all.","“伊迪丝——我看到他们了——妻子和孩子——所有人。"
"How canst—’","怎么会不是……”"
"They were sitting in the gathered darkness, and at that moment steps were heard without.","天越来越黑，他们就那么坐着。这时，外面传来了脚步声。"
"‘Go out this way,’ she said.","“从这边出去，”她说道，"
"‘It is my husband.","“是我丈夫来了，"
"He must not see thee in this mood.","可不能让他见到这种情绪下的你。"
"Get away till to-morrow, Roger, as you care for me.’","明天之前别回来，罗杰，虽然你很关心我。”"
"She pushed her brother through a door leading to the back stairs, and almost as soon as it was closed her visitor entered.","她将弟弟推出门外，这个门通向后面的楼梯。几乎是刚关上门，她的访客就进来了。"
"Roger, however, did not retreat down the stairs; he stood and looked through the bobbin-hole.","然而罗杰并没有下楼，他站在那里透过绕线管的洞向屋里看去。"
"If the visitor turned out to be Sir John, he had determined to confront him.","如果访客是约翰爵士的话，他决定与他当面对质。"
"It was the knight.","确实是爵士。"
"She had struck a light on his entry, and he kissed the child, and took Edith tenderly by the shoulders, looking into her face.","他进来时伊迪丝已经点起了灯，他亲了亲孩子，然后温柔地搂着她的双肩，注视着她的脸。"
"‘Something’s gone awry wi’ my dear!’ he said.","“亲爱的，你有点儿不对劲！”他说道，"
"‘What is it?","“怎么了？"
"What’s the matter?’","出什么事了？”"
"‘O, Jack!’ she cried.","“哦，杰克！”她喊道，"
"‘I have heard such a fearsome rumour—what doth it mean?","“我听到了一个可怕的谣言——这谣言是什么意思？"
"He who told me is my best friend.","告诉我的是我最好的朋友。"
"He must be deceived!","他肯定是被骗了！"
"But who deceived him, and why?","但是谁骗了他？又是为什么呢？"
"Jack, I was just told that you had a wife living when you married me, and have her still!’","杰克，有人刚跟我说，你与我结婚时已经有了一个妻子，而且她现在还是你的妻子！”"
"‘A wife?—H’m.’","“妻子？——呣。”"
"‘Yes, and children.","“是的，还有孩子。"
"Say no, say no!’","否认呀，否认！”"
"‘By God!","“上帝作证！"
"I have no lawful wife but you; and as for children, many or few, they are all bastards, save this one alone!’","你是我唯一的法定妻子，至于孩子们呢，不管有几个，他们都是私生子，除了这个孩子！”"
"‘And that you be Sir John Horseleigh of Clyfton?’","“那你是克莱弗顿的约翰·霍斯利爵士这事呢？”"
"‘I mid be.","“我或许是。"
"I have never said so to ’ee.’","我从未告诉过你这一点。”"
"‘But Sir John is known to have a lady, and issue of her!’","“可人们都说约翰爵士有位夫人，而且还和她有孩子！”"
"The knight looked down.","爵士低下了头。"
"‘How did thy mind get filled with such as this?’ he asked.","“你是怎么知道这些事情的？”他问。"
"‘One of my kindred came.’","“我的一个亲戚过来了。”"
"‘A traitor!","“叛徒！"
"Why should he mar our life?","他怎么能破坏我们的生活？"
"Ah! you said you had a brother at sea—where is he now?’","啊！你说过你有个兄弟在海上——他现在在哪儿？”"
"‘Here!’ came from close behind him.","“这儿！”声音就从他的背后传来。"
"And flinging open the door, Roger faced the intruder.","罗杰猛地甩开门，直面闯进屋的这个人。"
"‘Liar!’ he said, ‘to call thyself her husband!’","“骗子！”他吼道，“谎称自己是她丈夫！”"
"Sir John fired up, and made a rush at the sailor, who seized him by the collar, and in the wrestle they both fell, Roger under.","约翰爵士勃然大怒，冲向水手，水手一把揪住他的领口。搏斗中，他们都跌倒在地，罗杰被压在下面。"
"But in a few seconds he contrived to extricate his right arm, and drawing from his belt a knife which he wore attached to a cord round his neck he opened it with his teeth, and struck it into the breast of Sir John stretched above him.","但很快，他便设法将右胳膊挣脱出来，从腰带处抽出一把刀子，刀与挂在他脖子上的一根绳子相连。罗杰用牙咬住刀鞘，拔出刀，向压在他身上的约翰爵士的胸口刺去。"
"Edith had during these moments run into the next room to place the child in safety, and when she came back the knight was relaxing his hold on Roger’s throat.","这期间伊迪丝跑到另一个房间，把孩子放到安全的地方。等她回来时，爵士正逐渐松开自己掐在罗杰脖子上的手。"
"He rolled over upon his back and groaned.","他翻滚到一边，仰面朝天地呻吟着。"
"The only witness of the scene save the three concerned was the nursemaid, who had brought in the child on its father’s arrival.","除了三个当事人，这一场景唯一的见证者就是保姆。孩子的父亲到来时，是她把孩子抱进来的。"
"She stated afterwards that nobody suspected Sir John had received his death wound; yet it was so, though he did not die for a long while, meaning thereby an hour or two; that Mistress Edith continually endeavoured to staunch the blood, calling her brother Roger a wretch, and ordering him to get himself gone; on which order he acted, after a gloomy pause, by opening the window, and letting himself down by the sill to the ground.","根据她后来的陈述，当时没有人想到约翰爵士受了致命伤。然而事实的确如此，尽管过了好长时间他呼吸尚存，大约有一两个小时。女主人伊迪丝一直竭力为爵士止血，她一边骂着弟弟罗杰是个混蛋，一边命令他离开。罗杰沮丧地沉默了一会儿，听从了她的命令，打开窗户，从窗台跳了出去。"
"It was then that Sir John, in difficult accents, made his dying declaration to the nurse and Edith, and, later, the apothecary; which was to this purport, that the Dame Horseleigh who passed as his wife at Clyfton, and who had borne him three children, was in truth and deed, though unconsciously, the wife of another man.","就在那时，约翰爵士口齿模糊地向保姆和伊迪丝，之后还有药师，宣布了他的临终遗言。遗言的大意是，在克莱弗顿被认作是他妻子、并为他生了三个孩子的霍斯利夫人，确实是另一个男人的妻子，尽管她对此并不知情。"
"Sir John had married her several years before, in the face of the whole county, as the widow of one Decimus Strong, who had disappeared shortly after her union with him, having adventured to the North to join the revolt of the Nobles, and on that revolt being quelled retreated across the sea.","几年前，约翰爵士在全郡人的见证下与她成婚，而她当时是一个叫做德西默斯·斯特朗的人的遗孀。斯特朗与她成婚后不久就消失了，去了北方参加贵族的反叛运动，那次反叛被平息后，他便撤退到了海外。"
"Two years ago, having discovered this man to be still living in France, and not wishing to disturb the mind and happiness of her who believed herself his wife, yet wishing for legitimate issue, Sir John had informed the King of the facts, who had encouraged him to wed honestly, though secretly, the young merchant’s widow at Havenpool; she being, therefore, his lawful wife, and she only.","两年前，约翰爵士发现这个男人还生活在法国。他不想让自认为是他妻子的这个女人心烦，不想扰乱她快乐的生活，但又希望有合法的子女，于是便将实情告诉了国王。国王鼓励他与黑文普尔这位年轻商人的遗孀正式成婚，但要秘密进行。因此，她是他的合法妻子，而且是唯一的妻子。"
"That to avoid all scandal and hubbub he had purposed to let things remain as they were till fair opportunity should arise of making the true case known with least pain to all parties concerned, but that, having been thus suspected and attacked by his own brother-in-law, his zest for such schemes and for all things had died out in him, and he only wished to commend his soul to God.","为了避免一切流言和骚动，他打算让一切维持原状，直到有合适的机会出现才让真相大白，以将对当事人的伤害降到最低。然而，遭到妻弟这样的怀疑和攻击，他对自己的谋划和其他一切都失去了热忱，只希望将自己的灵魂交付上帝。"
"That night, while the owls were hooting from the forest that encircled the sleeping townlet, and the South-Avon was gurgling through the wooden piles of the bridge, Sir John died there in the arms of his wife.","那天夜里，小镇沉睡着，猫头鹰一直在环绕小镇的森林里鸣叫，南埃文河的河水汩汩地流过桥下的木桩，约翰爵士死在了自己妻子的怀抱里。"
"She concealed nothing of the cause of her husband’s death save the subject of the quarrel, which she felt it would be premature to announce just then, and until proof of her status should be forthcoming.","除了发生争吵这件事之外，她对丈夫的死因毫无隐瞒。因为她认为当时宣告这件事的时机还不成熟，除非有了证据，能够证明她的身份。"
"But before a month had passed, it happened, to her inexpressible sorrow, that the child of this clandestine union fell sick and died.","但过了还不到一个月，这段秘密婚姻中诞生的那个孩子碰巧生了一场病，之后便夭折了，令她悲痛欲绝。"
"From that hour all interest in the name and fame of the Horseleighs forsook the younger of the twain who called themselves wives of Sir John, and, being careless about her own fame, she took no steps to assert her claims, her legal position having, indeed, grown hateful to her in her horror at the tragedy.","从那一刻起，自称是约翰爵士妻子的两个女人中年轻的这一个就失去了对霍斯利家族名号和声望的兴趣，而且她对自己的名声也是漠不关心，没有采取任何措施要求自己的权利。由于这场悲剧带给她的恐惧感，这样一个合法身份对她来说其实已经变得可憎起来。"
"And Sir William Byrt, the curate who had married her to her husband, being an old man and feeble, was not disinclined to leave the embers unstirred of such a fiery matter as this, and to assist her in letting established things stand.","曾经主持她和她丈夫婚礼的牧师威廉·比尔特爵士因为年老体弱，也是乐意让这么轰轰烈烈的一件事情尘埃落定的，他也乐意帮助伊迪丝接受既定的事实。"
"Therefore, Edith retired with the nurse, her only companion and friend, to her native town, where she lived in absolute obscurity till her death in middle age.","因此，伊迪丝带着保姆，也是她唯一的同伴和朋友，一起回到了她的故乡。她在那里隐姓埋名地生活着，直到中年时离开人世。"
"Her brother was never seen again in England.","她的弟弟再也没有在英格兰出现过。"
"A strangely corroborative sequel to the story remains to be told.","这个故事还没完，它有个离奇的续篇，而且已经得到证实。"
"Shortly after the death of Sir John Horseleigh, a soldier of fortune returned from the Continent, called on Dame Horseleigh the fictitious, living in widowed state at Clyfton Horseleigh, and, after a singularly brief courtship, married her.","约翰·霍斯利爵士去世后不久，一位雇佣兵从欧洲大陆返回了这里。他拜访了寡居在克莱弗顿·霍斯利的那位假的霍斯利夫人，经过一段异常简短的追求后，便与她成婚了。"
"The tradition at Havenpool and elsewhere has ever been that this man was already her husband, Decimus Strong, who remarried her for appearance’ sake only.","黑文普尔和其他地方的说法是，这个男人其实本来就是她的丈夫，也就是德西默斯·斯特朗，他与她再次成婚只是为了可以公开露面。"
"The illegitimate son of this lady by Sir John succeeded to the estates and honours, and his son after him, there being nobody on the alert to investigate their pretensions.","这位夫人与约翰爵士的私生子继承了财产和封号，并一代代传了下去，也没有人随时准备着要去调查他们所获得的权利是否合法。"
"Little difference would it have made to the present generation, however, had there been such a one, for the family in all its branches, lawful and unlawful, has been extinct these many score years, the last representative but one being killed at the siege of Sherton Castle, while attacking in the service of the Parliament, and the other being outlawed later in the same century for a debt of ten pounds, and dying in the county jail.","然而即使有这么一个人，对于现在这一代人来说，也没什么区别。因为这么多年下来，这一家族的所有分支都不复存在，不管是合法继承人还是私生子。倒数第二个继承人在为英国议会效劳的袭击中，围攻谢尔顿城堡时被杀；最后一个继承人在同一世纪的晚些时候因为欠了10英镑的债务被剥夺了公民权，死在了郡监狱里。"
"The mansion house and its appurtenances were, as I have previously stated, destroyed, excepting one small wing, which now forms part of a farmhouse, and is visible as you pass along the railway from Casterbridge to Ivel.","正如我之前所陈述的，宅邸和周围的建筑都遭到毁坏，只有一间小侧厅得以幸存。现在它成了一间农舍的一部分，如果你沿着从卡斯特桥到艾弗尔的铁路走就能看到。"
"The outline of the old bowling-green is also distinctly to be seen.","过去那个草地保龄球场的轮廓也是清晰可见。"
"This, then, is the reason why the only lawful marriage of Sir John, as recorded in the obscure register at Havenpool, does not appear in the pedigree of the house of Horseleigh.","这就是为什么在黑文普尔字迹模糊的登记记录中，约翰爵士唯一合法的婚姻并没有出现在霍斯利家族的族谱上。"
"Spring 1893.","1893年春天。"
