"How Some Wild Animals Became Tame Ones","一些野生动物是怎样被驯服的"
"by Andrew Lang","作者：安德鲁·朗格"
"Once upon a time there lived a miller who was so rich that, when he was going to be married, he asked to the feast not only his own friends but also the wild animals who dwelt in the hills and woods round about.","从前，有一个磨坊主，相当富有，当他要结婚的时候，他不仅宴请了他的朋友，也宴请了那些居住在小山和树林附近的野生动物。"
"The chief of the bears, the wolves, the foxes, the horses, the cows, the goats, the sheep, and the reindeer, all received invitations; and as they were not accustomed to weddings they were greatly pleased and flattered, and sent back messages in the politest language that they would certainly be there.","熊的首领、狼、狐狸、马、奶牛、山羊、绵羊和驯鹿都收到了邀请函；它们并不常参加婚礼，所以它们非常高兴，而且感到荣幸，并用最礼貌的语言回信，表示它们一定会到场。"
"The first to start on the morning of the wedding-day was the bear, who always liked to be punctual; and, besides, he had a long way to go, and his hair, being so thick and rough, needed a good brushing before it was fit to be seen at a party.","在婚礼当天的早晨，第一个出发的是熊，它总是喜欢准时；此外，它有很长的路要走，它的毛发非常浓厚粗糙，需要好好刷洗一番，才适合参加派对。"
"However, he took care to awaken very early, and set off down the road with a light heart.","不管怎样，它很早就醒了，轻松愉快地沿路出发了。"
"Before he had walked very far he met a boy who came whistling along, hitting at the tops of the flowers with a stick.","还没走很远，它就碰到了一个男孩，他一路吹着口哨走过来，并用一根棍子敲打着花的顶端。"
"‘Where are you going?’ said he, looking at the bear in surprise, for he was an old acquaintance, and not generally so smart.","“你去哪儿啊？”他说，惊奇地望着熊，毕竟它是老熟人了，也不是很精明。"
"‘Oh, just to the miller’s marriage,’ answered the bear carelessly.","“噢，只是去参加磨坊主的婚礼，”熊漫不经心地回答，"
"‘Of course, I would much rather stay at home, but the miller was so anxious I should be there that I really could not refuse.’","“当然啦，我是宁愿呆在家里的，但是磨坊主迫切地希望我能去那儿，所以我真的不好拒绝。”"
"‘Don’t go, don’t go!’ cried the boy.","“不要去，不要去！”男孩喊道，"
"‘If you do you will never come back!","“如果你去的话，你将永远回不来了！"
"You have got the most beautiful skin in the world—just the kind that everyone is wanting, and they will be sure to kill you and strip you of it.’","你拥有世界上最漂亮的皮——正是每个人想要的那种，他们一定会杀了你，剥了你的皮的。”"
"‘I had not thought of that,’ said the bear, whose face turned white, only nobody could see it.","“我没有想到那点。”熊说。它的脸色发白，不过没有人看到，"
"‘If you are certain that they would be so wicked—but perhaps you are jealous because nobody has invited you?’","“如果你肯定他们会是如此邪恶——但也许是因为你嫉妒，因为没有人邀请你？”"
"‘Oh, nonsense!’ replied the boy angrily, ‘do as you see.","“哎呀，胡说！”男孩气愤地回答，“你看着办吧！"
"It is your skin, and not mine; I don’t care what becomes of it!’","反正是你的皮，不是我的；我才不在意它会怎样呢！”"
"And he walked quickly on with his head in the air.","他昂着头，继续快速地往前走。"
"The bear waited until he was out of sight, and then followed him slowly, for he felt in his heart that the boy’s advice was good, though he was too proud to say so.","熊等着，直到他从视线中消失，然后慢慢地跟着他，因为在它内心，它觉得男孩的忠告是好的，尽管它太骄傲而不愿意这样说。"
"The boy soon grew tired of walking along the road, and turned off into the woods, where there were bushes he could jump and streams he could wade; but he had not gone far before he met the wolf.","不一会儿，男孩就对一直沿着这条路走感到厌烦了，便转弯进了树林，那里有灌木丛，他跳得过去，有溪流，他趟得过去；但是，他还没走多远就碰到了狼。"
"‘Where are you going?’ asked he, for it was not the first time he had seen him.","“你到哪儿去啊？”他问，因为这不是他第一次看到它了。"
"‘Oh, just to the miller’s marriage,’ answered the wolf, as the bear had done before him.","“噢，只是去参加磨坊主的婚礼，”狼回答，正如之前熊回答他的一样，"
"‘It is rather tiresome, of course—weddings are always so stupid; but still one must be good-natured!’","“太无聊了，当然——婚礼总是乏味恼人的；但至少磨坊主是温厚善良的。”"
"‘Don’t go!’ said the boy again.","“不要去！”男孩再次说道，"
"‘Your skin is so thick and warm, and winter is not far off now.","“你的皮这么厚，这么暖和，现在离冬天不远了。"
"They will kill you, and strip it from you.’","他们会杀了你，剥了你的皮。”"
"The wolf’s jaw dropped in astonishment and terror.","狼惊讶地张大了嘴巴，下巴像掉下来一样。"
"‘Do you really think that would happen?’ he gasped.","“你真认为那会发生吗？”它喘着气。"
"‘Yes, to be sure, I do,’ answered the boy.","“对，当然，我肯定，”男孩回答，"
"‘But it is your affair, not mine.","“但是，那是你的事，不关我的事。"
"So good-morning,’ and on he went.","那么，早上好啊！”他继续前行。","早安"
"The wolf stood still for a few minutes, for he was trembling all over, and then crept quietly back to his cave.","狼站在原地几分钟，一动不动，它浑身颤抖着，然后悄悄地爬回了它的洞穴。"
"Next the boy met the fox, whose lovely coat of silvery grey was shining in the sun.","之后，男孩碰到了狐狸，它那漂亮的银灰色外衣在阳光下闪闪发光。"
"‘You look very fine!’ said the boy, stopping to admire him, ‘are you going to the miller’s wedding too?’","“你看起来气色很不错啊！”男孩停下来赞美它说，“你也是去磨坊主的婚礼吗？”"
"‘Yes,’ answered the fox; ‘it is a long journey to take for such a thing as that, but you know what the miller’s friends are like—so dull and heavy!","“是的，”狐狸回答，“磨坊主为准备这个婚礼花了相当长的时间，然而你知道，磨坊主的朋友是些什么样的人吗——如此迟钝和呆滞。"
"It is only kind to go and amuse them a little.’","过去让他们高兴一下只是出于好心。”"
"‘You poor fellow,’ said the boy pityingly.","“你这个可怜的家伙！”男孩怜惜地说，"
"‘Take my advice and stay at home.","“听我的忠告，呆在家里吧。"
"If you once enter the miller’s gate his dogs will tear you in pieces.’","如果你一旦进了磨坊主的大门，他的狗就会把你撕成碎片。”"
"‘Ah, well, such things have occurred, I know,’ replied the fox gravely.","“哦，哎呀，这种事情发生过，我知道。”狐狸神情严肃地回答。"
"And without saying any more he trotted off the way he had come.","没说更多，它就沿着它来时的路跑回去了。"
"His tail had scarcely disappeared, when a great noise of crashing branches was heard, and up bounded the horse, his black skin glistening like satin.","它的尾巴刚刚一消失，就听见一阵树枝折断的巨响，一匹马向上跳了过去，它的外皮像绸缎一样闪耀。"
"‘Good-morning,’ he called to the boy as he galloped past, ‘I can’t wait to talk to you now.","“早上好，”当它飞奔过去时，它向男孩呼喊道，“现在，我迫不及待要和你说话了。"
"I have promised the miller to be present at his wedding-feast, and they won’t sit down till I come.’","我已经向磨坊主承诺，将出席他的婚宴，直到我去他们才会坐下。”"
"‘Stop! stop!’ cried the boy after him, and there was something in his voice that made the horse pull up.","“停下！停下！”男孩在它后面喊道，他的声音里有一种力量使马停了下来。"
"‘What is the matter?’ asked he.","“怎么了？”它问。"
"‘You don’t know what you are doing,’ said the boy.","“你知不知道你正在做什么，”男孩说，"
"‘If once you go there you will never gallop through these woods any more.","“你一旦到了那儿，你将永远不可能再在这片树林里飞奔了。"
"You are stronger than many men, but they will catch you and put ropes round you, and you will have to work and to serve them all the days of your life.’","你比许多人要强壮得多，但是他们会抓到你，用绳索套住你，你将不得不在你生命中的每一天为他们工作和服务。”"
"The horse threw back his head at these words, and laughed scornfully.","听到这些话，马甩甩它的头，冷笑了一下。"
"‘Yes, I am stronger than many men,’ answered he, ‘and all the ropes in the world would not hold me.","“对，我要比许多人强壮得多，”它回答，“世界上所有的绳索都不能套住我。"
"Let them bind me as fast as they will, I can always break loose, and return to the forest and freedom.’","让他们以最快的速度绑我好了，我总是能挣脱开来，返回到森林，获得自由。”"
"And with this proud speech he gave a whisk of his long tail, and galloped away faster than before.","说完这些得意的话，它掸了掸它的长尾巴，以比之前更快的速度，飞驰离开了。"
"But when he reached the miller’s house everything happened as the boy had said.","然而，当他到达磨坊主的家时，正如男孩所言，一切都发生了。"
"While he was looking at the guests and thinking how much handsomer and stronger he was than any of them, a rope was suddenly flung over his head, and he was thrown down and a bit thrust between his teeth.","当它看着客人们，正在想它比他们中的任何一个都要漂亮和强壮得多时，突然，一根绳索抛过来套住了它的头，它被掀倒在地，一个马嚼子被猛插到了它的牙齿间。"
"Then, in spite of his struggles, he was dragged to a stable, and shut up for several days without any food, till his spirit was broken and his coat had lost its gloss.","那时，尽管它奋力挣扎，它还是被拖进了一个马厩，被关了几天，没有任何食物，直到它的精神崩溃，它的外衣失去了它的光泽。"
"After that he was harnessed to a plough, and had plenty of time to remember all he had lost through not listening to the counsel of the boy.","之后，它被拴在一个犁上，对于没有听取男孩的忠告而导致它所丧失的一切，它有大把的时间去回忆。"
"When the horse had turned a deaf ear to his words the boy wandered idly along, sometimes gathering wild strawberries from a bank, and sometimes plucking wild cherries from a tree, till he reached a clearing in the middle of the forest.","当马对男孩的话充耳不闻时，男孩在悠闲地漫步，有时从河边采集些野生草莓，有时从一棵树上采摘些野生樱桃，直到他到达森林中间的一块空地。"
"Crossing this open space was a beautiful milk-white cow with a wreath of flowers round her neck.","穿过这片空地，有一头漂亮的乳白色奶牛，它的脖子上套着一个花环。"
"‘Good-morning,’ she said pleasantly, as she came up to the place where the boy was standing.","“早上好。”当奶牛向男孩站着的地方走去时，它高兴地说。"
"‘Good-morning,’ he returned.","“早上好，”男孩回应，"
"‘Where are you going in such a hurry?’","“你如此匆忙，要到哪儿去啊？”"
"‘To the miller’s wedding; I am rather late already, for the wreath took such a long time to make, so I can’t stop.’","“去磨坊主的婚礼；我已经弄得很迟了，因为制作花环花了我好长时间，因此我不能停下来啊！”"
"‘Don’t go,’ said the boy earnestly;’ when once they have tasted your milk they will never let you leave them, and you will have to serve them all the days of your life.’","“不要去，”男孩认真地说，“当他们一旦品尝到你的牛奶，他们就不会让你离开了，你就不得不在你生命中的每一天去为他们服务了。”"
"‘Oh, nonsense; what do you know about it?’ answered the cow, who always thought she was wiser than other people.","“噢，胡说；你知道什么？”奶牛回答，它总是认为它自己要比其他人更聪明，"
"‘Why, I can run twice as fast as any of them!","“为什么呢？因为我能跑得比他们任何人快两倍！"
"I should like to see anybody try to keep me against my will.’","我倒想看看那些设法让我违背我意愿的人。”"
"And, without even a polite bow, she went on her way, feeling very much offended.","它甚至没有客气地鞠个躬，就继续走路了，而且感到非常生气。"
"But everything turned out just as the boy had said.","然而，一切都正如男孩所言。"
"The company had all heard of the fame of the cow’s milk, and persuaded her to give them some, and then her doom was sealed.","这群人已经听说过了奶牛的牛奶的传闻，就劝它给他们一些，于是，它的厄运开始了。"
"A crowd gathered round her, and held her horns so that she could not use them, and, like the horse, she was shut in the stable, and only let out in the mornings, when a long rope was tied round her head, and she was fastened to a stake in a grassy meadow.","一伙人聚集在它的周围，握住它的两个角以便它不能使用它们。像那匹马一样，它被关在牛棚里，只在早上才被放出来。一根长绳系在它的脖子上，绳子的另一端系在一块草坪里的一个木桩上。"
"And so it happened to the goat and to the sheep.","同样，这也发生在了山羊和绵羊身上。"
"Last of all came the reindeer, looking as he always did, as if some serious business was on hand.","最后，驯鹿来了，看起来它和以往一样，好像手边总有一些重要的事情要做。"
"‘Where are you going?’ asked the boy, who by this time was tired of wild cherries, and was thinking of his dinner.","“你去哪里啊？”男孩问，在这个时候，他厌烦了野生樱桃，而正在考虑他的晚餐。"
"‘I am invited to the wedding,’ answered the reindeer, ‘and the miller has begged me on no account to fail him.’","“我被邀请去参加婚礼啊，”驯鹿回答，“磨坊主已经恳求我了，我不能让他失望啊！”"
"‘O fool!’ cried the boy, ‘have you no sense at all?","“哎，你傻啊！”男孩喊道，“你完全没有意识到吗？"
"Don’t you know that when you get there they will hold you fast, for neither beast nor bird is as strong or as swift as you?’","你难道不知道，当你到了那儿，他们就会迅速地控制你，因为没有野兽或鸟类会和你一样强壮、敏捷？”"
"‘That is exactly why I am quite safe,’ replied the reindeer.","“这正是我为什么相当安全的原因啊，”驯鹿回应，"
"‘I am so strong that no one can bind me, and so swift that not even an arrow can catch me.","“我这么强壮，没有人能绑得住我；我这么敏捷，即使是一支箭也赶不上我。"
"So, goodbye for the present, you will soon see me back.’","好吧，暂且再见，不久，你会看到我回来的。”"
"But none of the animals that went to the miller’s wedding ever came back.","但是，没有一个去参加磨坊主婚礼的动物回来过。"
"And because they were self-willed and conceited, and would not listen to good advice, they and their children have been the servants of men to this very day.","因为它们任性顽固、自负狂妄，不愿听取金玉良言，直到今天，它们和它们的子孙一直是人类的奴仆。"
