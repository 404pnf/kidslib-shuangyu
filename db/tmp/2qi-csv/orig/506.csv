"“And Summer’s lease hath all too short a date.”","“夏日的逗留总是如此短暂。”"
"—Shakespeare","——莎士比亚"
"I","1.0"
"In the last day of May in the early ’nineties, about six o’clock of the evening, old Jolyon Forsyte sat under the oak tree below the terrace of his house at Robin Hill.","九十年代初一个五月的最后一天，傍晚六点左右，老乔利恩·福赛特坐在一棵橡树下，就在他罗宾山宅第的走廊下面。"
"He was waiting for the midges to bite him, before abandoning the glory of the afternoon.","即使蠓虫会来咬他，他也要享受这傍晚的美好时光。"
"His thin brown hand, where blue veins stood out, held the end of a cigar in its tapering, long-nailed fingers—a pointed polished nail had survived with him from those earlier Victorian days when to touch nothing, even with the tips of the fingers, had been so distinguished.","他的手瘦黄，青筋暴露；一截雪茄烟头夹在瘦削的手指间，指甲很长——有一只光亮的尖指甲是他从维多利亚时代早期就一直留着的。当时，人们认为不用手，甚至不用指尖去碰任何东西才是十分高贵。"
"His domed forehead, great white moustache, lean cheeks, and long lean jaw were covered from the westering sunshine by an old brown Panama hat.","他前额圆阔，双颊瘦削，下颌长瘦，留着浓密的大白胡子；一顶又黄又旧的巴拿马草帽为他遮挡西斜的日光。"
"His legs were crossed; in all his attitude was serenity and a kind of elegance, as of an old man who every morning put eau de Cologne upon his silk handkerchief.","他跷着腿，神情自若且优雅。一个每天早上都要往丝质手帕上洒古龙香水的老人，正是如此。"
"At his feet lay a woolly brown-and-white dog trying to be a Pomeranian—the dog Balthasar between whom and old Jolyon primal aversion had changed into attachment with the years.","一只棕白相间的长毛狗趴着他的脚边，扮作博美犬的样子—这就是小狗巴尔萨泽。多年过去，它与老乔利恩已经由最初的相互敌视转为亲密无间了。"
"Close to his chair was a swing, and on the swing was seated one of Holly’s dolls—called ‘Duffer Alice’—with her body fallen over her legs and her doleful nose buried in a black petticoat.","他椅子旁有架秋千，上面坐着霍利的一只玩偶——名叫“笨蛋艾丽斯”——她的上身倒在腿上，那只悲惨的鼻子埋在她的黑裙里。"
"She was never out of disgrace, so it did not matter to her how she sat.","她一向不惹人怜爱，所以坐姿如何也就无所谓了。"
"Below the oak tree the lawn dipped down a bank, stretched to the fernery, and, beyond that refinement, became fields, dropping to the pond, the coppice, and the prospect—‘Fine, remarkable’—at which Swithin Forsyte, from under this very tree, had stared five years ago when he drove down with Irene to look at the house.","橡树下是草坪，草坪沿着斜坡往下，连着精心修剪的蕨类种植园，再往那边是田野，接着地势更低了，一直到池塘和小灌木林，还有那片斯威辛·福赛特曾感叹“不错，美极了”的景色——五年前他和艾琳一起坐马车过来看房子时，曾在这棵橡树下凝望这片美景。"
"Old Jolyon had heard of his brother’s exploit—that drive which had become quite celebrated on Forsyte ‘Change. Swithin!","老乔利恩听说过他弟弟的辉煌成就——那次出行曾在整个福赛特交易所引起轰动。斯威辛！"
"And the fellow had gone and died, last November, at the age of only seventy-nine, renewing the doubt whether Forsytes could live for ever, which had first arisen when Aunt Ann passed away.","不曾想，去年十一月，这位老兄弟就死了，才七十九岁。这让人们又一次怀疑，福赛特家族的人是否真能永远不死。他们第一次有这种怀疑，还是在安姑太去世的时候呢。"
"Died! and left only Jolyon and James, Roger and Nicholas and Timothy, Julia, Hester, Susan!","又走了一个。现在只剩下老乔利恩、詹姆斯、罗杰、尼古拉斯、蒂莫西、茱莉娅、赫斯特，还有苏姗了！"
"And old Jolyon thought: ‘Eighty-five!","老乔利恩想：“八十五了！"
"I don’t feel it—except when I get that pain.’","我可没觉得——不过那儿疼的时候除外。”"
"His memory went searching.","他继续回想着往事。"
"He had not felt his age since he had bought his nephew Soames’ ill-starred house and settled into it here at Robin Hill over three years ago.","三年前，他从侄子索姆斯手中买下了这座不祥之屋，搬到了罗宾山。打那以后，他还不觉得自己老过。"
"It was as if he had been getting younger every spring, living in the country with his son and his grandchildren—June, and the little ones of the second marriage, Jolly and Holly; living down here out of the racket of London and the cackle of Forsyte ‘Change,’ free of his boards, in a delicious atmosphere of no work and all play, with plenty of occupation in the perfecting and mellowing of the house and its twenty acres, and in ministering to the whims of Holly and Jolly.","他跟儿子乔、孙女琼，还有乔再婚后生的乔利和霍利一起生活在乡下，远离伦敦的喧闹，也没有福赛特交易所的聒噪，不开董事会，不用工作，尽情玩乐，这让他觉得自己每年都年轻了一些。他每天花大量时间完善屋舍，打理周边的二十英亩地，由着霍利和乔利的性子做这做那。"
"All the knots and crankiness, which had gathered in his heart during that long and tragic business of June, Soames, Irene his wife, and poor young Bosinney, had been smoothed out.","琼、索姆斯和他妻子艾琳，还有小波辛尼，这几个人之间的恩怨长久以来在他心里生了许多郁结，可如今，也都逐渐化解了。"
"Even June had thrown off her melancholy at last—witness this travel in Spain she was taking now with her father and her stepmother.","就连琼也终于不再忧伤——现在正和父亲与继母一起在西班牙旅行。"
"Curiously perfect peace was left by their departure; blissful, yet blank, because his son was not there.","没想到他们走后，日子显得格外平静，幸福却又冷清，因为儿子不在身边。"
"Jo was never anything but a comfort and a pleasure to him nowadays—an amiable chap; but women, somehow—even the best—got a little on one’s nerves, unless of course one admired them.","乔是个让人心宽的孩子，近来给他带来很多慰藉和快乐；可是女人，不知为何，即使是最好的女人，也难免让人有些心烦，当然，除非你对她心驰神往。"
"Far-off a cuckoo called; a wood-pigeon was cooing from the first elm-tree in the field, and how the daisies and buttercups had sprung up after the last mowing!","远处传来布谷鸟的叫声；一只斑鸠在田野那边的第一棵榆树上咕咕啼唱。自上次刈草后，雏菊和毛茛长得多快啊！"
"The wind had got into the sou’ west, too—a delicious air, sappy!","风也转为西南风——好甜美的空气，甘露一般！"
"He pushed his hat back and let the sun fall on his chin and cheek.","他往后推了推帽子，让阳光照在他的下颌和脸颊上。"
"Somehow, to-day, he wanted company—wanted a pretty face to look at.","不知为何，今天他想让人陪着——有张漂亮的脸看看也好。"
"People treated the old as if they wanted nothing.","人们总以为老人无欲无求。"
"And with the un-Forsytean philosophy which ever intruded on his soul, he thought: ‘One’s never had enough.","不时侵入他灵魂的非福赛特哲学此时又在唱和，他想：“人永远不会满足。"
"With a foot in the grave one’ll want something, I shouldn’t be surprised!’","就算是快要入土的人也会有所欲求，这有什么好奇怪的！”"
"Down here—away from the exigencies of affairs—his grandchildren, and the flowers, trees, birds of his little domain, to say nothing of sun and moon and stars above them, said, ‘Open, sesame,’ to him day and night.","就在这乡下——远离世事扰攘的地方，他的孙子孙女、花儿、树，还有他小家园的鸟儿们，更不用说他们头顶上的日月星辰，日日夜夜都在对他说：“芝麻，开门。”"
"And sesame had opened—how much, perhaps, he did not know.","门终究是开了——开了多大，也许他并不清楚。"
"He had always been responsive to what they had begun to call ‘Nature,’ genuinely, almost religiously responsive, though he had never lost his habit of calling a sunset a sunset and a view a view, however deeply they might move him.","他总能很快地感应到人们口中的“自然”，这种感应发自内心，几乎像对宗教般虔诚。可不管自然多么打动他，他也不会改变看法，夕阳就是夕阳，风景就是风景。"
"But nowadays Nature actually made him ache, he appreciated it so.","如今自然却让他隐隐作痛，他对这一点有切身体会。"
"Every one of these calm, bright, lengthening days, with Holly’s hand in his, and the dog Balthasar in front looking studiously for what he never found, he would stroll, watching the roses open, fruit budding on the walls, sunlight brightening the oak leaves and saplings in the coppice, watching the water-lily leaves unfold and glisten, and the silvery young corn of the one wheat field; listening to the starlings and skylarks, and the Alderney cows chewing the cud, flicking slow their tufted tails; and every one of these fine days he ached a little from sheer love of it all, feeling perhaps, deep down, that he had not very much longer to enjoy it.","现在白天越来越长，在每个这样宁静明媚的日子，老乔利恩都会牵着霍利的手去散步，小狗巴尔萨泽跑在前面，努力寻找它从来没找到的那些东西。他们看着玫瑰花开，墙上的枝条结出果子，阳光照亮橡树叶子和灌木林中的小树苗，睡莲的叶子舒展开来，闪着光，还有唯一的一片麦田里银色的新麦；听着椋鸟和云雀歌唱，看着奥尔德尼乳牛嚼着草，慢慢地摇着蓬松的尾巴。他珍爱每一个这样美好的日子，却也因此感到心中隐隐作痛，因为在内心深处，他觉得自己也许已时日无多，再也无法享受这一切。"
"The thought that some day—perhaps not ten years hence, perhaps not five—all this world would be taken away from him, before he had exhausted his powers of loving it, seemed to him in the nature of an injustice brooding over his horizon.","想到有一天——也许不到十年，也许不到五年——所有这一切都会从他身边消失，而他还没有倾尽所有力量来爱这个世界，这在他看来太不公平了。"
"If anything came after this life, it wouldn’t be what he wanted; not Robin Hill, and flowers and birds and pretty faces—too few, even now, of those about him!","即使有来世，也不会是他想要的。不会有罗宾山，不会有花和鸟，也不会有漂亮的脸蛋——就算是现在，这些在他的生活中也太少！"
"With the years his dislike of humbug had increased; the orthodoxy he had worn in the ‘sixties, as he had worn side-whiskers out of sheer exuberance, had long dropped off, leaving him reverent before three things alone—beauty, upright conduct, and the sense of property; and the greatest of these now was beauty.","年岁渐长，他越发痛恨欺骗。六十年代时，他还是一副道貌岸然的样子，当时蓄起络腮胡子纯属年轻气盛，现在它们早已稀疏。如今他仍信奉着只有三样东西——美、正直的品行以及财产意识。而当下，美才是其中最重要的。"
"He had always had wide interests, and, indeed could still read The Times, but he was liable at any moment to put it down if he heard a blackbird sing.","他一直对许多事情饶有兴趣，也依然会读读《泰晤士报》，不过，一旦耳边传来画眉鸟的叫声，他就会立刻丢下手中的报纸。"
"Upright conduct, property—somehow, they were tiring; the blackbirds and the sunsets never tired him, only gave him an uneasy feeling that he could not get enough of them.","正直的品行、财产——不知怎的，这些东西会让人觉得厌烦；画眉鸟和落日却从来不会，只会让他觉得不安心，总怕自己听不够、看不够。"
"Staring into the stilly radiance of the early evening and at the little gold and white flowers on the lawn, a thought came to him: This weather was like the music of ‘Orfeo,’ which he had recently heard at Covent Garden.","他出神地望着黄昏时分静谧的余晖，还有草地上金色和白色的小花，心想：这天气多像《奥菲欧》里的音乐呀！不久前，他刚在科文特加登剧院听过这场歌剧。"
"A beautiful opera, not like Meyerbeer, nor even quite Mozart, but, in its way, perhaps even more lovely; something classical and of the Golden Age about it, chaste and mellow, and the Ravogli ‘almost worthy of the old days’—highest praise he could bestow.","那场歌剧很精彩，它不像梅耶贝尔，也不怎么像莫扎特，它有自己的风格，或许这样更显得可爱。它带有古典风格和黄金时代的色彩，纯洁而浓郁，还有拉沃戈里，“堪比昔日”——这是他所能给出的最佳称赞。"
"The yearning of Orpheus for the beauty he was losing, for his love going down to Hades, as in life love and beauty did go—the yearning which sang and throbbed through the golden music, stirred also in the lingering beauty of the world that evening.","俄耳甫斯怀念逝去的美人，怀念他撒手人寰的爱人，世间的爱和美的结局皆是如此——那金子般的音乐动人地诉说着这段情思，也在今晚迟迟未散的美丽中跃动。"
"And with the tip of his cork-soled, elastic-sided boot he involuntarily stirred the ribs of the dog Balthasar, causing the animal to wake and attack his fleas; for though he was supposed to have none, nothing could persuade him of the fact.","他穿着两边有松紧的软木底靴，鞋尖不经意地踢到了小狗巴尔萨泽的肋骨，把它戳醒了。小家伙于是开始捉起身上的跳蚤来；虽然它身上根本没有，可它怎么也不相信。"
"When he had finished he rubbed the place he had been scratching against his master’s calf, and settled down again with his chin over the instep of the disturbing boot.","弄完后，它又把抓过的地方在主人的小腿肚上蹭了蹭，然后又趴下来，把下巴搭在那只戳醒它的靴子上。"
"And into old Jolyon’s mind came a sudden recollection—a face he had seen at that opera three weeks ago—Irene, the wife of his precious nephew Soames, that man of property!","老乔利恩突然回忆起了什么：三周前他在剧院见过一张面孔——是艾琳，他那拥有产业的宝贝侄子索姆斯的妻子！"
"Though he had not met her since the day of the ‘At Home’ in his old house at Stanhope Gate, which celebrated his granddaughter June’s ill-starred engagement to young Bosinney, he had remembered her at once, for he had always admired her—a very pretty creature.","老乔利恩上次见到她，还是在斯坦霍普门旧居举办的茶会上，那次是为了庆祝他孙女琼和小波辛尼不幸的订婚。即便如此，他还是立刻认出了她，因为他早就十分欣赏这位天生丽人。"
"After the death of young Bosinney, whose mistress she had so reprehensibly become, he had heard that she had left Soames at once.","艾琳后来成了小波辛尼的情妇，这件事颇受非议。小波辛尼死后，他听说艾琳立刻离开了索姆斯。"
"Goodness only knew what she had been doing since.","没有人知道她后来的情况。"
"That sight of her face—a side view—in the row in front, had been literally the only reminder these three years that she was still alive.","那天她坐在前排，他只看了个侧脸。但那却是三年来唯一的消息，让人知道她还活着。"
"No one ever spoke of her.","从来没有人谈起过她。"
"And yet Jo had told him something once—something which had upset him completely.","不过有一次，乔向他说起过什么，让他很不愉快。"
"The boy had got it from George Forsyte, he believed, who had seen Bosinney in the fog the day he was run over—something which explained the young fellow’s distress—an act of Soames towards his wife—a shocking act.","他觉得乔是从乔治·福赛特那里听来的。那天下着大雾，乔治看到了波辛尼，他就是那天出的车祸。乔告诉了老乔利恩索姆斯对妻子的所作所为——令人震惊，这也正是让年轻的波辛尼万分痛苦的原因。"
"Jo had seen her, too, that afternoon, after the news was out, seen her for a moment, and his description had always lingered in old Jolyon’s mind—‘wild and lost’ he had called her.","那天下午，就在消息传出后，乔也见到了她，时间不长。老乔利恩始终无法忘记乔是如何描述艾琳的——说她“疯疯癫癫，丢了魂一般”。"
"And next day June had gone there—bottled up her feelings and gone there, and the maid had cried and told her how her mistress had slipped out in the night and vanished.","第二天，琼也去看她，努力掩饰着自己的情绪去看她。女仆哭着告诉她女主人夜里偷偷跑了出去，不见了。"
"A tragic business altogether!","彻头彻尾的悲剧！"
"One thing was certain—Soames had never been able to lay hands on her again.","可以确定的一点是——从那以后，索姆斯再也没找到艾琳。"
"And he was living at Brighton, and journeying up and down—a fitting fate, the man of property!","他后来搬去了布赖顿，整天东奔西跑——有产业的人，就该是这个命！"
"For when he once took a dislike to anyone—as he had to his nephew—old Jolyon never got over it.","老乔利恩一旦不喜欢某个人，比如他侄子，就不会再改变。"
"He remembered still the sense of relief with which he had heard the news of Irene’s disappearance.","他仍记得自己听说艾琳失踪时是如何如释重负。"
"It had been shocking to think of her a prisoner in that house to which she must have wandered back, when Jo saw her, wandered back for a moment—like a wounded animal to its hole after seeing that news, ‘Tragic death of an Architect,’ in the street.","乔看见她时，她一定是看见了街上那条“一名建筑师惨死”的消息，然后，迷迷糊糊走回了那间屋子，就像受伤的动物慢慢挪回自己的洞穴。想想她像个囚犯似的住在那里面，真叫人不好受。"
"Her face had struck him very much the other night—more beautiful than he had remembered, but like a mask, with something going on beneath it.","那晚的见面着实让他心里一惊，那张脸比他记忆中的还要美，但却像戴着一张面具，下面隐藏着什么东西。"
"A young woman still—twenty-eight perhaps.","她年纪还轻——可能二十八岁上下。"
"Ah, well!","唉，好吧！"
"Very likely she had another lover by now.","她现在很可能已经找到爱人了。"
"But at this subversive thought—for married women should never love: once, even, had been too much—his instep rose, and with it the dog Balthasar’s head.","已婚女人不该再爱上别人，哪怕一次也不行——一想到她有违传统的做法，他又抬了抬脚，巴尔萨泽的头也跟着抬了起来。"
"The sagacious animal stood up and looked into old Jolyon’s face.","敏锐的小家伙爬起来，望着老乔利恩的脸。"
"‘Walk?’ he seemed to say; and old Jolyon answered: “Come on, old chap!”","它仿佛在说：“去散步吗？”老乔利恩回答道：“走吧，老伙计！”"
"Slowly, as was their wont, they crossed among the constellations of buttercups and daisies, and entered the fernery.","和往常一样，他们缓步穿过了黄毛茛和雏菊丛，走进了蕨草园。"
"This feature, where very little grew as yet, had been judiciously dropped below the level of the lawn so that it might come up again on the level of the other lawn and give the impression of irregularity, so important in horticulture.","这时蕨草还没长出多少；这里的设计十分巧妙，这片地刚好比草坪低一些，草长长后就和另一块草坪一样高了，给人一种不规则的感觉，园艺学很讲究这个。"
"Its rocks and earth were beloved of the dog Balthasar, who sometimes found a mole there.","巴尔萨泽特别喜欢这里的石块和泥土，有时它还能找着一只鼹鼠。"
"Old Jolyon made a point of passing through it because, though it was not beautiful, he intended that it should be, some day, and he would think: ‘I must get Varr to come down and look at it; he’s better than Beech.’","老乔利恩是特地从这里穿过来的，虽然这里现在算不上美，但他觉得总有一天会变美，他总是想：“我得让瓦尔过来看看，他可比比奇强。”"
"For plants, like houses and human complaints, required the best expert consideration.","花草就像房子和疾病一样，需要最出色的行家帮忙料理。"
"It was inhabited by snails, and if accompanied by his grandchildren, he would point to one and tell them the story of the little boy who said: ‘Have plummers got leggers, Mother?","这里还有不少蜗牛，要是有孙子孙女陪着，他就会指着其中一只，给他们讲一个小男孩的故事。小男孩问：“妈妈，李子有腿吗？”"
"‘No, sonny.’","“没有，宝贝。”"
"‘Then darned if I haven’t been and swallowed a snileybob.’","“那可糟糕啦，我好像吞下了一只蜗牛宝宝。”"
"And when they skipped and clutched his hand, thinking of the snileybob going down the little boy’s ‘red lane,’ his eyes would twinkle.","孩子们听了就会跳起来，紧紧抓住他的手，想象着蜗牛宝宝爬过那小男孩的“红红的喉洞”，他的眼睛就会闪闪发亮。"
"Emerging from the fernery, he opened the wicket gate, which just there led into the first field, a large and park-like area, out of which, within brick walls, the vegetable garden had been carved.","走过蕨草园，他打开小门，门正好通向第一块田地。那块地大得像公园一样，外面用砖墙围出一个菜园。"
"Old Jolyon avoided this, which did not suit his mood, and made down the hill towards the pond.","老乔利恩没心情去菜园，他于是下了山坡，向池塘走去。"
"Balthasar, who knew a water-rat or two, gambolled in front, at the gait which marks an oldish dog who takes the same walk every day.","巴尔萨泽知道那里有一两只水鼠，于是蹦蹦跳跳地走在前面。它每天都走这条路，所以再熟悉不过了；从步态中看得出它年纪不轻了。"
"Arrived at the edge, old Jolyon stood, noting another water-lily opened since yesterday; he would show it to Holly to-morrow, when ‘his little sweet’ had got over the upset which had followed on her eating a tomato at lunch—her little arrangements were very delicate.","老乔利恩在池塘边站了一会，看到昨天又有一朵睡莲开了；他明天要带霍利来看，那时“小甜心”的腹泻就好了——霍利的小肠胃特别娇弱，午餐时只吃了一个西红柿就拉肚子了。"
"Now that Jolly had gone to school—his first term—Holly was with him nearly all day long, and he missed her badly.","乔利已经上学了——这是第一个学期——之前他几乎整天都和霍利黏在一起，所以现在非常想她。"
"He felt that pain too, which often bothered him now, a little dragging at his left side.","他又感到疼了，最近经常这样，身体左肋处隐隐作痛。"
"He looked back up the hill.","他回头望了望小山。"
"Really, poor young Bosinney had made an uncommonly good job of the house; he would have done very well for himself if he had lived!","的确，可怜的小波辛尼把宅子建得非常出色；如果现在他还活着，应该已经很成功了！"
"And where was he now?","那他现在在哪里呢？"
"Perhaps, still haunting this, the site of his last work, of his tragic love affair.","也许他的灵魂还在这里徘徊，这里有他最后一件作品，也是他爱情悲剧发生的地方。"
"Or was Philip Bosinney’s spirit diffused in the general?","或者菲利普·波辛尼的灵魂已经融入了这里的一草一木？"
"Who could say?","谁又能说得清呢？"
"That dog was getting his legs muddy!","巴尔萨泽腿上沾满了泥！"
"And he moved towards the coppice.","他朝小灌木林走去。"
"There had been the most delightful lot of bluebells, and he knew where some still lingered like little patches of sky fallen in between the trees, away out of the sun.","前些日子，那里到处都是风信子，特别惹人喜爱；他知道在林中几片太阳照不到的地方有一些仍开着，就像从树间落下的块块天空。"
"He passed the cow-houses and the hen-houses there installed, and pursued a path into the thick of the saplings, making for one of the bluebell plots.","他路过那里的牛棚和鸡舍，从小路穿过茂密的幼苗林，朝有风信子的地方走去。"
"Balthasar, preceding him once more, uttered a low growl.","巴尔萨泽又跑到他前面去了，发出一声低沉的吼叫。"
"Old Jolyon stirred him with his foot, but the dog remained motionless, just where there was no room to pass, and the hair rose slowly along the centre of his woolly back.","老乔利恩用脚碰了碰他，小狗还是一动不动，就在前面把路挡住，它蓬松后背中间的毛慢慢地立了起来。"
"Whether from the growl and the look of the dog’s stivered hair, or from the sensation which a man feels in a wood, old Jolyon also felt something move along his spine.","不知道是因为听见狗叫，看到狗毛竖起，还是因为人在树林中都有这种感觉，老乔利恩也感到脊梁骨发凉。"
"And then the path turned, and there was an old mossy log, and on it a woman sitting.","接着到了小路拐弯处，那里横着一根长满苔藓的老原木，一个女人坐在上面。"
"Her face was turned away, and he had just time to think: ‘She’s trespassing—I must have a board put up!’ before she turned.","她的脸侧对着他，就在她回头之前，他还在想：“她竟然擅闯私人庄园——我得立一块牌子才行！”这时那张脸转了过来。"
"Powers above!","天哪！"
"The face he had seen at the opera—the very woman he had just been thinking of!","就是他在剧院看到的那张脸——他刚才想到的那个女人！"
"In that confused moment he saw things blurred, as if a spirit—queer effect—the slant of sunlight perhaps on her violet-grey frock!","在那心神迷惘的时刻，他眼中的景象竟都模糊了，前面仿佛是一个精灵——真是怪事——也许是因为阳光斜斜地照在她紫灰色连衣裙上！"
"And then she rose and stood smiling, her head a little to one side.","她站起身莞尔一笑，头向一旁微微侧着。"
"Old Jolyon thought: ‘How pretty she is!’","老乔利恩心想：“她可真漂亮！”"
"She did not speak, neither did he; and he realized why with a certain admiration.","她没说话，他也没开口；他明白了自己为何会如此欣赏她。"
"She was here no doubt because of some memory, and did not mean to try and get out of it by vulgar explanation.","毫无疑问，她是来怀念过往的，她也不打算找个粗鄙的理由为自己开脱。"
"“Don’t let that dog touch your frock,” he said; “he’s got wet feet.","“别让狗碰到裙子，”他说：“它的爪子是湿的。"
"Come here, you!”","巴尔萨泽，过来！”"
"But the dog Balthasar went on towards the visitor, who put her hand down and stroked his head.","但巴尔萨泽却朝客人走了过去。她用手摸了摸狗的头。"
"Old Jolyon said quickly:","老乔利恩马上说："
"“I saw you at the opera the other night; you didn’t notice me.”","“我那晚在歌剧院见过你；你没注意到我。”"
"“Oh, yes! I did.”","“哦，不！我看见您了。”"
"He felt a subtle flattery in that, as though she had added: ‘Do you think one could miss seeing you?’","他感到那句话带着点儿微微的奉承，就好像她接下来要说：“您觉得谁会看不见您吗？”"
"“They’re all in Spain,” he remarked abruptly.","“他们都在西班牙呢，”他突然开口说道，"
"“I’m alone; I drove up for the opera.","“我自己一个人住，有时开车去听听歌剧。"
"The Ravogli’s good.","拉沃戈里唱得很好。"
"Have you seen the cow-houses?”","你看见牛棚了吗？”"
"In a situation so charged with mystery and something very like emotion he moved instinctively towards that bit of property, and she moved beside him.","在这一充满神秘和类似情感的情形下，他本能地朝那片产业走了过去，艾琳也和他并肩走着。"
"Her figure swayed faintly, like the best kind of French figures; her dress, too, was a sort of French grey.","她腰肢轻摆，和最曼妙的法国女子的腰肢一样；连衣裙也是那种法兰西式的浅灰色。"
"He noticed two or three silver threads in her amber-coloured hair, strange hair with those dark eyes of hers, and that creamy-pale face.","他注意到她琥珀色的头发中有两三根银丝，与她深色的双眸、象牙白的面庞不太相配。"
"A sudden sidelong look from the velvety brown eyes disturbed him.","她那天鹅绒般的棕色眼眸突然望了他一眼，让他心神一颤。"
"It seemed to come from deep and far, from another world almost, or at all events from some one not living very much in this.","他觉得这一瞥像来自十分遥远的地方，几乎来自另一个世界，至少也是没怎么在这个世界生活过的人才会有这种眼神。"
"And he said mechanically:","他不禁问道："
"“Where are you living now?”","“你现在住哪儿？”"
"“I have a little flat in Chelsea.”","“我在切尔西租了间小公寓。”"
"He did not want to hear what she was doing, did not want to hear anything; but the perverse word came out:","他不想知道她在做什么，不想听任何事情；但那句不合时宜的话还是脱口而出："
"“Alone?”","“一个人？”"
"She nodded.","她点点头。"
"It was a relief to know that.","这倒让他宽慰了些。"
"And it came into his mind that, but for a twist of fate, she would have been mistress of this coppice, showing these cow-houses to him, a visitor.","他突然想到，要不是命运的捉弄，她本应是这片小灌木林的女主人，带他这位客人看这些牛棚。"
"“All Alderneys,” he muttered; “they give the best milk.","“这些都是奥尔德尼牛，”他嘀咕道，“能产出最好的牛奶。"
"This one’s a pretty creature.","这头长得很漂亮。"
"Woa, Myrtle!”","噢，桃金娘！”"
"The fawn-coloured cow, with eyes as soft and brown as Irene’s own, was standing absolutely still, not having long been milked.","这头浅黄褐色的奶牛，眸子也是棕色的，和艾琳的一样柔和。刚挤完奶不久，它站在那里一动不动。"
"She looked round at them out of the corner of those lustrous, mild, cynical eyes, and from her grey lips a little dribble of saliva threaded its way towards the straw.","它用眼角打量着他们，那眼神光亮、温和，又有点儿愤世嫉俗，一缕涎液从灰色的唇边淌到稻草上。"
"The scent of hay and vanilla and ammonia rose in the dim light of the cool cow-house; and old Jolyon said:","凉爽的牛棚里光线昏暗，隐隐飘着干草、香草和氨水的气味；老乔利恩说："
"“You must come up and have some dinner with me.","“你一定要过来和我一起吃晚饭。"
"I’ll send you home in the carriage.”","我会派马车送你回去。”"
"He perceived a struggle going on within her; natural, no doubt, with her memories.","他察觉到艾琳内心的犹豫；这很自然，毕竟有那段回忆。"
"But he wanted her company; a pretty face, a charming figure, beauty!","可他希望她能陪着他；美丽的面庞，曼妙的身姿，真美！"
"He had been alone all the afternoon.","整个下午他都是一个人。"
"Perhaps his eyes were wistful, for she answered: “Thank you, Uncle Jolyon.","也许是因为他渴望的眼神；她答道：“谢谢您，乔利恩伯伯。 "
"I should like to.”","我很乐意。”"
"He rubbed his hands, and said:","他搓着手说："
"“Capital! Let’s go up, then!”","“好极了！我们这就上去！”"
"And, preceded by the dog Balthasar, they ascended through the field.","于是，巴尔萨泽领头，他们穿过田野走上去。"
"The sun was almost level in their faces now, and he could see, not only those silver threads, but little lines, just deep enough to stamp her beauty with a coin-like fineness—the special look of life unshared with others.","这时的太阳几乎和他们的脸在同一水平线上了。老乔利恩不仅看到了些许银发，还看到了一些皱纹，不深不浅，让她的美如精雕细琢的硬币头像般精致——与众不同的人生才有的独特之美。"
"“I’ll take her in by the terrace,” he thought: “I won’t make a common visitor of her.”","“我要带她从露台进去，”他心想：“可不能当她是普普通通的来客。”"
"“What do you do all day?” he said.","“你每天都做些什么？”他问。"
"“Teach music; I have another interest, too.”","“教音乐；也有别的兴趣。”"
"“Work!” said old Jolyon, picking up the doll from off the swing, and smoothing its black petticoat.","“工作！”老乔利恩边说边拿起秋千上的娃娃，抚平它黑色的裙子，"
"“Nothing like it, is there?","“什么也不如工作，对吗？"
"I don’t do any now.","我现在什么也不做了。"
"I’m getting on.","年岁大了。"
"What interest is that?”","你说的兴趣是指什么？”"
"“Trying to help women who’ve come to grief.”","“想办法帮助落难的女人。”"
"Old Jolyon did not quite understand.","老乔利恩没听太懂。"
"“To grief?” he repeated; then realised with a shock that she meant exactly what he would have meant himself if he had used that expression.","“落难？”他重复道；接着一惊，这才明白艾琳的意思跟他自己偶尔说到这个词时的意思如出一辙。"
"Assisting the Magdalenes of London!","帮助伦敦从良的妓女！"
"What a weird and terrifying interest!","多么让人惊悸又难以置信的兴趣！"
"And, curiosity overcoming his natural shrinking, he asked:","然而，好奇心战胜了天然的畏缩，他问："
"“Why?","“为什么？"
"What do you do for them?”","你怎么帮她们？”"
"“Not much.","“帮不上太多。"
"I’ve no money to spare.","没有钱给她们。"
"I can only give sympathy and food sometimes.”","只能表示同情，有时给她们点儿吃的。”"
"Involuntarily old Jolyon’s hand sought his purse.","老乔利恩的手不由得摸向了自己的钱袋。"
"He said hastily: “How d’you get hold of them?”","他连忙问：“你怎么认识她们的？”"
"“I go to a hospital.”","“在医院。”"
"“A hospital! Phew!”","“啊，医院。”"
"“What hurts me most is that once they nearly all had some sort of beauty.”","“她们从前几乎都有自己的美，这最让我难受。”"
"Old Jolyon straightened the doll.","老乔利恩拉直了手中的玩偶。"
"“Beauty!” he ejaculated: “Ha! Yes!","“美！”他突然说道，“呵！可不是！"
"A sad business!” and he moved towards the house.","多么悲惨！”于是向房子走去。"
"Through a French window, under sun-blinds not yet drawn up, he preceded her into the room where he was wont to study The Times and the sheets of an agricultural magazine, with huge illustrations of mangold wurzels, and the like, which provided Holly with material for her paint brush.","老乔利恩带她走到一扇落地窗前，掀起百叶帘，来到自己平时读书的房间。除了读《泰晤士报》，他也看农业杂志，上面有大幅的甜菜之类的插图，正好可以用作霍利画画的素材。"
"“Dinner’s in half an hour.","“晚饭半个小时后就好。"
"You’d like to wash your hands!","洗洗手吧！"
"I’ll take you to June’s room.”","我带你去琼的房间。”"
"He saw her looking round eagerly; what changes since she had last visited this house with her husband, or her lover, or both perhaps—he did not know, could not say!","老乔利恩看到艾琳热切地环顾四周；她上次来还是和丈夫一起，或者和情人一起，又或者跟他们都一起来过。这之后发生了多少变化，他不知道，更说不上来！"
"All that was dark, and he wished to leave it so.","这还是个秘密，他也不打算弄明白。"
"But what changes!","但确实变了很多！"
"And in the hall he said:","在厅堂里，他说："
"“My boy Jo’s a painter, you know.","“我儿子乔是个画家，你知道。 "
"He’s got a lot of taste.","他很有品位。"
"It isn’t mine, of course, but I’ve let him have his way.”","当然，跟我的不同，不过我由着他了。”"
"She was standing very still, her eyes roaming through the hall and music room, as it now was—all thrown into one, under the great skylight.","她站在那里，一动不动，目光在厅堂和琴房间缓缓移动着。现在，大天窗底下的这两间房已经被打通成了一间。"
"Old Jolyon had an odd impression of her.","她给了老乔利恩一种奇妙的感觉。"
"Was she trying to conjure somebody from the shades of that space where the colouring was all pearl-grey and silver?","她莫不是想从那块珍珠灰和银色空间的阴影中用意念唤出一个人？"
"He would have had gold himself; more lively and solid.","他自己倒是想用金色的，生动又稳重。"
"But Jo had French tastes, and it had come out shadowy like that, with an effect as of the fume of cigarettes the chap was always smoking, broken here and there by a little blaze of blue or crimson colour.","但是乔的品位是法国式的，家里的装修那样朦胧虚幻，就像这小子常抽烟吐出的烟雾一般，还缀上星星点点的蓝色或深红色。"
"It was not his dream!","这可不是他想要的！"
"Mentally he had hung this space with those gold-framed masterpieces of still and stiller life which he had bought in days when quantity was precious.","他原想在这间屋子挂上金框的静物画和更静的静物画佳作；他当时买的时候，人们更讲究收藏的数量。"
"And now where were they?","这些画现在都哪里去了？"
"Sold for a song!","都贱卖了！"
"That something which made him, alone among Forsytes, move with the times had warned him against the struggle to retain them.","在福赛特家族成员中，他是唯一紧跟时代的人，正因为如此，他努力说服自己不保留这些画。"
"But in his study he still had ‘Dutch Fishing Boats at Sunset.’","但他的书房里还挂着那幅《日暮时分的荷兰渔船》。"
"He began to mount the stairs with her, slowly, for he felt his side.","他们一起上楼，上得很慢，因为他左肋有点儿疼。 "
"“These are the bathrooms,” he said, “and other arrangements.","“这是浴室，”他说，“还有洗手间。"
"I’ve had them tiled.","我都铺了瓷砖。"
"The nurseries are along there.","孩子的房间在那边。"
"And this is Jo’s and his wife’s.","这儿是乔和他妻子的房间。"
"They all communicate.","房间是通着的。"
"But you remember, I expect.”","我想，你应该还记得。”"
"Irene nodded.","艾琳点点头。"
"They passed on, up the gallery and entered a large room with a small bed, and several windows.","他们沿着走廊继续往前，走进了一个大房间，里面摆着一张小床，有几扇窗户。"
"“This is mine,” he said.","“我就住这儿。”他说。"
"The walls were covered with the photographs of children and watercolour sketches, and he added doubtfully:","墙上挂着许多孩子的照片和水彩画，他迟疑着说："
"“These are Jo’s.","“都是乔的画。"
"The view’s first-rate.","这儿视野非常好。"
"You can see the Grand Stand at Epsom in clear weather.”","天气晴朗的时候能看见埃普索姆跑马场的大看台。”"
"The sun was down now, behind the house, and over the ‘prospect’ a luminous haze had settled, emanation of the long and prosperous day.","此时，太阳已经西沉，落到了房子后面。明亮的雾霭飘浮在那片“景色”之上，仿佛映射着这悠长而繁荣的一天。"
"Few houses showed, but fields and trees faintly glistened, away to a loom of downs.","望不见什么房子，不过田野和树木若隐若现，远处是一片朦胧的高地。"
"“The country’s changing,” he said abruptly, “but there it’ll be when we’re all gone.","“乡下也变了，”他突然说道，“但即使我们都不在了，它还会在。"
"Look at those thrushes—the birds are sweet here in the mornings.","你看那些画眉，早上这儿的鸟叫声真动听。"
"I’m glad to have washed my hands of London.”","真高兴我与伦敦再无瓜葛。”"
"Her face was close to the window pane, and he was struck by its mournful look.","艾琳的脸靠着窗格；看到她悲戚的神情，老乔利恩心中一动。"
"‘Wish I could make her look happy!’ he thought.","“真希望能让她开心起来！”他想着。"
"‘A pretty face, but sad!’","“多美的一张脸，却这么哀伤。”"
"And taking up his can of hot water he went out into the gallery.","他提起房里那罐热水，走出房间来到走廊。"
"“This is June’s room,” he said, opening the next door and putting the can down; “I think you’ll find everything.”","“这是琼的房间，”他说着打开了隔壁房间的门，把罐子放下，“我想你可以自己看看。”"
"And closing the door behind her he went back to his own room.","他走出去，关上她身后的门，回到自己的房间。"
"Brushing his hair with his great ebony brushes, and dabbing his forehead with eau de Cologne, he mused.","他用那柄大乌木梳理了理头发，往额头拍了点儿古龙水，陷入沉思。"
"She had come so strangely—a sort of visitation; mysterious, even romantic, as if his desire for company, for beauty, had been fulfilled by whatever it was which fulfilled that sort of thing.","她就这么来了——算是种天赐吧；有些神秘，甚至还带点儿浪漫。似乎他对有人为伴和对美好的渴望都得到了满足；究竟是什么满足了这些东西？还是先别去追问了。"
"And before the mirror he straightened his still upright figure, passed the brushes over his great white moustache, touched up his eyebrows with eau de Cologne, and rang the bell.","站在镜子前，他挺了挺还算笔直的腰，用刷子在他的大白胡子上刷了几下，又用古龙水沾了沾眉毛，然后摇响了铃。"
"“I forgot to let them know that I have a lady to dinner with me.","“我忘了告诉他们，今晚有位女士与我一同用餐。"
"Let cook do something extra, and tell Beacon to have the landau and pair at half-past ten to drive her back to Town to-night.","告诉厨师加点儿菜，还有，让贝肯今晚十点半备好马车和两匹马，送她回城。"
"Is Miss Holly asleep?”","霍利小姐睡了吗？”"
"The maid thought not.","女仆说可能还没。"
"And old Jolyon, passing down the gallery, stole on tiptoe towards the nursery, and opened the door whose hinges he kept specially oiled that he might slip in and out in the evenings without being heard.","老乔利恩踮着脚尖沿着走廊来到孩子的房间，打开门——他特意给门的铰链上了油，这样他就可以在夜晚溜进溜出，而不吵醒霍利。"
"But Holly was asleep, and lay like a miniature Madonna, of that type which the old painters could not tell from Venus, when they had completed her.","霍利已经睡着了，她躺在那里，像个小小的圣母玛利亚，就是那种连老画家完成这件作品后都无法区分这究竟是圣母还是维纳斯形象的效果。"
"Her long dark lashes clung to her cheeks; on her face was perfect peace—her little arrangements were evidently all right again.","她纤长浓黑的睫毛贴在面颊上；脸上一片安详——她的小肠胃显然已经恢复了。"
"And old Jolyon, in the twilight of the room, stood adoring her!","老乔利恩站在灯光昏暗的房间里，就那样欣赏着她！"
"It was so charming, solemn, and loving—that little face.","这么迷人、神圣、惹人怜爱——这样一张小脸。"
"He had more than his share of the blessed capacity of living again in the young.","能在后代人身上重新活过，这是一种福分，已经超出了他应得的份额。"
"They were to him his future life—all of a future life that his fundamental pagan sanity perhaps admitted.","对他来说，他们就是自己未来的生命——整个未来的生命，这或许是他这个不信教、崇尚理性的人不得不承认的。"
"There she was with everything before her, and his blood—some of it—in her tiny veins.","她还有整段人生在等着她，而他的血液——部分血液——流淌在她细小的血管中。"
"There she was, his little companion, to be made as happy as ever he could make her, so that she knew nothing but love.","他会尽其所能，使这个小伙伴过得幸福，让她只享受爱，感受不到何疾苦。"
"His heart swelled, and he went out, stilling the sound of his patent-leather boots.","他的心充实起来，走出房间时，轻手轻脚地不让自己的漆皮靴发出声响。"
"In the corridor an eccentric notion attacked him: To think that children should come to that which Irene had told him she was helping!","在走廊里，一个古怪的念头浮现在他的脑海中：要是孩子们沦落得和艾琳正在帮助的那些人一样，可怎么办！。"
"Women who were all, once, little things like this one sleeping there!","她们也曾经都是小女孩，像正在熟睡的霍利一样的小女孩！"
"‘I must give her a cheque!’ he mused; ‘Can’t bear to think of them!’","“我必须给她张支票！”他想着，“一想到那些人就难受！”"
"They had never borne reflecting on, those poor outcasts; wounding too deeply the core of true refinement hidden under layers of conformity to the sense of property—wounding too grievously the deepest thing in him—a love of beauty which could give him, even now, a flutter of the heart, thinking of his evening in the society of a pretty woman.","他从来不敢去想这些可怜的流浪者；因为这刺伤了他层层财产意识下埋藏的一种高尚情感；伤害了他内心深处对美的向往。即使现在，一想到今晚有一位漂亮女士相伴就心神荡漾的时刻，他依然感到了这种伤害。"
"And he went downstairs, through the swinging doors, to the back regions.","他走下楼，穿过弹簧门，走到后面。"
"There, in the wine-cellar, was a hock worth at least two pounds a bottle, a Steinberg Cabinet, better than any Johannisberg that ever went down throat; a wine of perfect bouquet, sweet as a nectarine—nectar indeed!","在酒窖里，他收藏了一种霍克酒，一瓶至少两英镑，属于施泰因贝格秘制酒，口感比任何约翰尼斯堡葡萄酒都好；气味醇香，味道如蜜桃般甘甜——简直就是花蜜！"
"He got a bottle out, handling it like a baby, and holding it level to the light, to look.","老乔利恩取了一瓶出来，好像对待婴儿一般捧在手里，横过来举到灯光下查看。"
"Enshrined in its coat of dust, that mellow coloured, slender-necked bottle gave him deep pleasure.","色调深沉的细颈瓶包裹在一层神秘的灰尘中，圣物一般，给老乔利恩带来了深深的愉悦。"
"Three years to settle down again since the move from Town—ought to be in prime condition!","从城中搬到这里已经三年了——应当到了最好喝的时候！"
"Thirty-five years ago he had bought it—thank God he had kept his palate, and earned the right to drink it.","三十五年前他买了这些酒——谢天谢地，他现在还能品酒，还有啜饮的资格。"
"She would appreciate this; not a spice of acidity in a dozen.","她会喜欢的；十瓶里也尝不出一丁点儿酸味。"
"He wiped the bottle, drew the cork with his own hands, put his nose down, inhaled its perfume, and went back to the music room.","他擦了擦酒瓶，自己动手拔出软木塞，鼻子凑过去闻了闻酒香，回到琴房。"
"Irene was standing by the piano; she had taken off her hat and a lace scarf she had been wearing, so that her gold-coloured hair was visible, and the pallor of her neck.","艾琳正站在钢琴边；她脱下了帽子和一直围着的蕾丝围巾，露出了金色发和苍白的脖颈。"
"In her grey frock she made a pretty picture for old Jolyon, against the rosewood of the piano.","身穿灰色长裙的艾琳，配上紫檀木制的钢琴，在老乔利恩眼中是一幅绝美的图画。"
"He gave her his arm, and solemnly they went.","他让她挽起自己的胳膊，两人庄重地走向餐室。"
"The room, which had been designed to enable twenty-four people to dine in comfort, held now but a little round table.","这间餐室原来的设计足以供二十四人舒适地就餐，现在却只放了一张小圆桌。"
"In his present solitude the big dining-table oppressed old Jolyon; he had caused it to be removed till his son came back.","目前独居的状态，让老乔利恩不大习惯一张大餐桌；他于是让人把它搬走，等儿子回来后再做打算。"
"Here in the company of two really good copies of Raphael Madonnas he was wont to dine alone.","他之前常常一个人就餐；只有两幅堪称精品的拉斐尔圣母像与他相伴。 "
"It was the only disconsolate hour of his day, this summer weather.","在这初夏时节，这会儿是他一天中唯一难熬的时刻。"
"He had never been a large eater, like that great chap Swithin, or Sylvanus Heythorp, or Anthony Thornworthy, those cronies of past times; and to dine alone, overlooked by the Madonnas, was to him but a sorrowful occupation, which he got through quickly, that he might come to the more spiritual enjoyment of his coffee and cigar.","他一向吃得很少，不像大家伙斯威辛，或者西尔韦纳斯·黑多普，还有安东尼·多恩华绥，他的旧友们；在圣母玛利亚的注视中独自进餐，对他来说实在难受，于是他总是草草解决，然后泡杯咖啡，点根雪茄，享受它们带来的精神愉悦。"
"But this evening was a different matter!","但今晚不一样！"
"His eyes twinkled at her across the little table and he spoke of Italy and Switzerland, telling her stories of his travels there, and other experiences which he could no longer recount to his son and grand-daughter because they knew them.","他望着小桌对面的艾琳，讲起自己在意大利和瑞士的旅行见闻，眼睛闪着亮光；他还讲了些不能再和儿子和孙女讲起的经历，因为他们都已经听过了。"
"This fresh audience was precious to him; he had never become one of those old men who ramble round and round the fields of reminiscence.","这个新听众对他来说很难得；他从来不像有的老人一样，只沉浸在回忆里。"
"Himself quickly fatigued by the insensitive, he instinctively avoided fatiguing others, and his natural flirtatiousness towards beauty guarded him specially in his relations with a woman.","他自己就很厌倦那些迟钝的人，所以会本能地避免令人生厌；天生对美色的敏感使他在与女性交往中格外注意这一点。"
"He would have liked to draw her out, but though she murmured and smiled and seemed to be enjoying what he told her, he remained conscious of that mysterious remoteness which constituted half her fascination.","他本想引她畅所欲言，但她只是低语了几句，笑了笑，仿佛听他谈话就很开心，可他仍旧能感觉到她那种神秘的疏离感，她之所以迷人，这恐怕占了一半的原因。"
"He could not bear women who threw their shoulders and eyes at you, and chattered away; or hard-mouthed women who laid down the law and knew more than you did.","他受不了女人秋波频传，喋喋不休，也受不了女人牙尖嘴利，自以为是，比你懂得还多。"
"There was only one quality in a woman that appealed to him—charm; and the quieter it was, the more he liked it.","女人身上只有一种特质能够吸引他——妩媚；而且越是不动声色的妩媚，他越是喜欢。"
"And this one had charm, shadowy as afternoon sunlight on those Italian hills and valleys he had loved.","而眼前这位就很妩媚，梦幻得像他钟情的意大利丘陵和山谷上的午后阳光。"
"The feeling, too, that she was, as it were, apart, cloistered, made her seem nearer to himself, a strangely desirable companion.","她身上淡淡的、不食人间烟火的气息，倒似乎使她与自己更加亲近，这正是他想要的伴侣。"
"When a man is very old and quite out of the running, he loves to feel secure from the rivalries of youth, for he would still be first in the heart of beauty.","一个男人年事已高、凡事没有胜算时，就不愿再与年轻人一争高下，因为只有这样，他才能在美人的心里仍然占据首要位置。"
"And he drank his hock, and watched her lips, and felt nearly young.","他品着酒，凝视着她的嘴唇，感觉自己都年轻了。"
"But the dog Balthasar lay watching her lips too, and despising in his heart the interruptions of their talk, and the tilting of those greenish glasses full of a golden fluid which was distasteful to him.","小狗巴尔萨泽也趴在那里看她的嘴唇，两人谈话中断时，它就会觉得很讨厌；它还讨厌他们举起绿色玻璃杯，里面盛满了它觉得难喝的黄水。"
"The light was just failing when they went back into the music-room.","他们回到音乐室时，天色刚刚开始暗下来。"
"And, cigar in mouth, old Jolyon said:","老乔利恩咬着只雪茄，说道："
"“Play me some Chopin.”","“弹支肖邦吧。”"
"By the cigars they smoke, and the composers they love, ye shall know the texture of men’s souls.","从男人抽的雪茄和喜欢的作曲家，你能够看到他们灵魂的本质。"
"Old Jolyon could not bear a strong cigar or Wagner’s music.","老乔利恩抽不惯烈性雪茄，也听不惯瓦格纳的音乐。"
"He loved Beethoven and Mozart, Handel and Gluck, and Schumann, and, for some occult reason, the operas of Meyerbeer; but of late years he had been seduced by Chopin, just as in painting he had succumbed to Botticelli.","他喜欢贝多芬和莫扎特、汉德尔和格鲁克以及舒曼，不知道为什么，他还喜欢梅耶贝尔的歌剧；但到了晚年，他开始痴迷于肖邦，正如他曾经被波提切利的油画所折服一样。"
"In yielding to these tastes he had been conscious of divergence from the standard of the Golden Age.","他意识到，沦于如此品位的自己已经偏离了黄金时代的格调。"
"Their poetry was not that of Milton and Byron and Tennyson; of Raphael and Titian; Mozart and Beethoven.","他们的意蕴不像弥尔顿、拜伦和丁尼生，不像拉斐尔和提香，也不像莫扎特和贝多芬。"
"It was, as it were, behind a veil; their poetry hit no one in the face, but slipped its fingers under the ribs and turned and twisted, and melted up the heart.","这些意蕴似乎隔着一层纱；它们从不直扑面门，而是悄然将手指伸到你的肋骨下面，来回翻腾，让心跌宕起伏。"
"And, never certain that this was healthy, he did not care a rap so long as he could see the pictures of the one or hear the music of the other.","他不能确定这些东西是否有益，但是只要能欣赏波提切利的油画，聆听肖邦的音乐，他就毫不在意了。"
"Irene sat down at the piano under the electric lamp festooned with pearl-grey, and old Jolyon, in an armchair, whence he could see her, crossed his legs and drew slowly at his cigar.","艾琳已经在钢琴前坐好，头顶是盏带有珠灰色花饰的灯；老乔利恩坐在扶手椅上——这里可以看见她——翘着腿，缓缓地抽着雪茄。"
"She sat a few moments with her hands on the keys, evidently searching her mind for what to give him.","艾琳把双手放在琴键上，坐了一会儿，显然是在思索该给他弹哪首曲子。"
"Then she began and within old Jolyon there arose a sorrowful pleasure, not quite like anything else in the world.","然后她开始弹琴；老乔利恩心里涌起一阵悲伤的快乐，这种情绪与世间别种都截然不同。"
"He fell slowly into a trance, interrupted only by the movements of taking the cigar out of his mouth at long intervals, and replacing it.","他渐渐陷入一阵恍惚，隔好大一会儿，才把雪茄从嘴里拿出，再放回去，每每此时，他才暂时回过神来。"
"She was there, and the hock within him, and the scent of tobacco; but there, too, was a world of sunshine lingering into moonlight, and pools with storks upon them, and bluish trees above, glowing with blurs of wine-red roses, and fields of lavender where milk-white cows were grazing, and a woman all shadowy, with dark eyes and a white neck, smiled, holding out her arms; and through air which was like music a star dropped and was caught on a cow’s horn.","这里有她、腹内的霍克酒，还有烟草的味道。可这里似乎还有另外一番景象：日光渐黯，月亮升起，水塘中静立着许多鹳鸟，淡蓝色的树下，摇曳着酒红色玫瑰的朦胧花影；熏衣草的田野里，乳白色的牛正在吃草，还有一位身影朦胧女士，她眼睛乌黑，脖颈雪白，微笑着，伸出双手。一颗星星坠落下来，透过音乐般美妙的空气，落在了牛角上。"
"He opened his eyes.","他睁开双眼。"
"Beautiful piece; she played well—the touch of an angel!","优美的乐曲；演奏得也精彩——简直如天使弹奏一般！"
"And he closed them again.","他又闭上了眼。"
"He felt miraculously sad and happy, as one does, standing under a lime-tree in full honey flower.","哀愁与欢愉在他心里神奇地融合在一起，如同一个人站在椴树下，闻到满树的花香。"
"Not live one’s own life again, but just stand there and bask in the smile of a woman’s eyes, and enjoy the bouquet!","不再重复以往的生活，而是站在那里，沐浴在一个女人含笑的目光中，享受着鲜花的香味！"
"And he jerked his hand; the dog Balthasar had reached up and licked it.","他不禁抬起手；巴尔萨泽凑过来舔了几下。"
"“Beautiful!” He said: “Go on—more Chopin!”","“太美了！”他说：“接着弹——多弹些肖邦！”"
"She began to play again.","她又继续弹了下去。"
"This time the resemblance between her and ‘Chopin’ struck him.","这一次，他惊讶地发现她和肖邦曲如此契合。"
"The swaying he had noticed in her walk was in her playing too, and the Nocturne she had chosen and the soft darkness of her eyes, the light on her hair, as of moonlight from a golden moon.","他曾留意过她走路时身姿摇曳，此刻的演奏中也有这样的摇曳；她选择的夜曲、她眼里的温柔暗影、她秀发上跃动的华彩，就如同金色月亮洒下的月光。"
"Seductive, yes; but nothing of Delilah in her or in that music.","的确，很诱人；但是她和她所弹奏的曲子却不带丝毫情色的诱惑。"
"A long blue spiral from his cigar ascended and dispersed.","一缕青色的烟从他的雪茄上盘旋上升，又消散开来。"
"‘So we go out!’ he thought.","“我们就这样消失了！”他想，"
"‘No more beauty!","“再也看不到美人！"
"Nothing?’","什么都没了？”"
"Again Irene stopped.","艾琳又停下来。"
"“Would you like some Gluck?","“您想听听格鲁克吗？"
"He used to write his music in a sunlit garden, with a bottle of Rhine wine beside him.”","他过去常在阳光下的花园里谱曲，边上少不了一瓶莱茵白葡萄酒。”"
"“Ah! yes.","“啊！对。"
"Let’s have ‘Orfeo.’”","弹首《奥菲欧》吧。”"
"Round about him now were fields of gold and silver flowers, white forms swaying in the sunlight, bright birds flying to and fro.","此刻，他如同置身于金银色的花朵竞相开放的田野之中，白色的轮廓在阳光下摇曳，色彩明艳的鸟儿在空中飞翔。"
"All was summer.","一切都是夏天的景象。"
"Lingering waves of sweetness and regret flooded his soul.","甜蜜和悲叹如潮水般徘徊不去，淹没了他的灵魂。"
"Some cigar ash dropped, and taking out a silk handkerchief to brush it off, he inhaled a mingled scent as of snuff and eau de Cologne.","一些烟灰落了下来，老乔利恩拿出丝帕把它擦干净时，闻到了一股像是鼻烟和古龙水混合起来的香味。"
"‘Ah!’ he thought, ‘Indian summer—that’s all!’ and he said: “You haven’t played me ‘Che faro.’”","“哦！”他想，“印第安之夏——这就是了！”他说：“你还没给我弹《我可怎么办》呢。”"
"She did not answer; did not move.","她没有回应，也没有动。"
"He was conscious of something—some strange upset.","老乔利恩察觉到了什么——一丝奇怪的难过。"
"Suddenly he saw her rise and turn away, and a pang of remorse shot through him.","突然，他看见她站起来，转过身去，一阵懊悔顿时涌上心头。"
"What a clumsy chap!","你这个蠢老头啊！"
"Like Orpheus, she of course—she too was looking for her lost one in the hall of memory!","和俄耳甫斯一样，她当然也正在这记忆的厅堂里苦苦寻觅失去的情人啊！"
"And disturbed to the heart, he got up from his chair.","他从椅子上站起来，心里还在为刚才的失言而懊恼。"
"She had gone to the great window at the far end.","她已经走到房间尽头的大窗户前。"
"Gingerly he followed.","他小心翼翼地跟了上去。"
"Her hands were folded over her breast; he could just see her cheek, very white.","她双手交叠在胸前；他只能看见她的脸颊，非常苍白。"
"And, quite emotionalized, he said:","他动情地说："
"“There, there, my love!”","“好了，好了，乖乖。”"
"The words had escaped him mechanically, for they were those he used to Holly when she had a pain, but their effect was instantaneously distressing.","这话是不假思索地说出的，因为霍利弄疼了的时候，他常常这样安慰她，可是这些话用在此时却是适得其反。"
"She raised her arms, covered her face with them, and wept.","艾琳抬起手臂，遮住脸，眼泪掉了下来。"
"Old Jolyon stood gazing at her with eyes very deep from age.","老乔利恩站在她面前，用一双凹陷的老眼凝视着她。"
"The passionate shame she seemed feeling at her abandonment, so unlike the control and quietude of her whole presence was as if she had never before broken down in the presence of another being.","她的情绪失控与她一贯沉静矜持的仪态极为不符，她似乎为此感到非常羞愧，好像之前还从未在人前这样无法自持过。"
"“There, there—there, there!” he murmured, and putting his hand out reverently, touched her.","“好了，好了——好了，好了！”他喃喃地说着，小心翼翼地伸出手，碰了碰她。"

"With the wisdom of a long life old Jolyon did not speak.","深谙世事的老乔利恩此刻一言不发。"
"Even grief sobbed itself out in time; only Time was good for sorrow—Time who saw the passing of each mood, each emotion in turn; Time the layer-to-rest.","即便痛苦也有完结的时候，时间是治愈痛苦的唯一良药——时间见证了每段心境与每份情怀的一一流逝；时间是一切的安葬者。"
"There came into his mind the words: ‘As panteth the hart after cooling streams’—but they were of no use to him.","他脑海里忽然浮现出：“如鹿切慕溪水”那句诗——可惜这句对他没用。"
"Then, conscious of a scent of violets, he knew she was drying her eyes.","接着，他嗅到一丝紫罗兰的香气，知道她在擦眼泪。"
"He put his chin forward, pressed his moustache against her forehead, and felt her shake with a quivering of her whole body, as of a tree which shakes itself free of raindrops.","他扬起下巴，用胡子抵住她的额头，只觉她浑身都战栗了一下，就像一棵树在抖掉身上的雨滴。"
"She put his hand to her lips, as if saying: “All over now!","她捧起他的手吻了一下，好像在说：“没事了！"
"Forgive me!”","对不起！”"
"The kiss filled him with a strange comfort; he led her back to where she had been so upset.","这一吻给了他莫名的安慰；他带她回到之前她感到不悦的座位上。"
"And the dog Balthasar, following, laid the bone of one of the cutlets they had eaten at their feet.","小狗巴尔萨泽也跟着，把他们刚才吃剩的一块肉骨头叼到他们脚下。"
"Anxious to obliterate the memory of that emotion, he could think of nothing better than china; and moving with her slowly from cabinet to cabinet, he kept taking up bits of Dresden and Lowestoft and Chelsea, turning them round and round with his thin, veined hands, whose skin, faintly freckled, had such an aged look.","他急切地想让她忘掉刚才那场不快——似乎没有什么比鉴赏瓷器更好的了；他们一个橱柜接一个慢慢看过来，他一会儿拿起这件德累斯顿，一会儿拿那件洛斯托夫特，又拿起一件切尔西，一双瘦削而青筋暴露的手把瓷器颠来倒去，隐隐看得见皮肤上的雀斑——老态尽显。"
"“I bought this at Jobson’s,” he would say; “cost me thirty pounds.","“这件是我在乔布森家买的，”他说，“花了我三十镑。"

"But you don’t remember.","可你不记得了。"
"Here’s a nice piece of Chelsea.","这件切尔西是好东西。"
"Now, what would you say this was?”","你看，这是一件什么瓷器？”"
"And he was comforted, feeling that, with her taste, she was taking a real interest in these things; for, after all, nothing better composes the nerves than a doubtful piece of china.","他觉得宽慰了些，认为她这样品位不俗的人，定是真心对这些东西感兴趣；毕竟，没有什么比一件诱人猜度的瓷器更能让人安定心神了。"
"When the crunch of the carriage wheels was heard at last, he said:","终于听到马车轮子隆隆的声音了，他说："
"“You must come again; you must come to lunch, then I can show you these by daylight, and my little sweet—she’s a dear little thing.","“你一定要再来；一定要来吃午饭，到时候我就能在白天拿这些东西给你看了，你还能见见我的小甜心——她是个惹人爱的小家伙。"
"This dog seems to have taken a fancy to you.”","这狗好像很喜欢你。”"
"For Balthasar, feeling that she was about to leave, was rubbing his side against her leg.","巴尔萨泽觉得她要走了，正拿身子蹭她的腿。"
"Going out under the porch with her, he said:","他陪她一同走到门廊，说道："
"“He’ll get you up in an hour and a quarter.","“车夫一小时零一刻钟就能送你到家。"
"Take this for your protegees,” and he slipped a cheque for fifty pounds into her hand.","替那些你救助的人收下吧。”他说着将一张五十镑的支票塞到她手里。"
"He saw her brightened eyes, and heard her murmur: “Oh! Uncle Jolyon!” and a real throb of pleasure went through him.","他看见她眼睛一亮，嘴里喃喃道：“哎呀！乔利恩伯伯！”他顿时感到一股喜悦涌遍全身。"
"That meant one or two poor creatures helped a little, and it meant that she would come again.","那意味着一两个可怜人会得到扶助，也意味着她会再来。"
"He put his hand in at the window and grasped hers once more.","他把手伸进车窗，又握了一下她的手。"
"The carriage rolled away.","马车开走了。"
"He stood looking at the moon and the shadows of the trees, and thought: ‘A sweet night! She...!’","他站在那儿望着月亮和树影，心想：“多么美好的夜晚！她……！”"

"At first he felt taller and full of a new vigour; then he felt restless.","起初，他觉得自己高了些，而且充满了新的活力；之后他又感到焦躁不安。"
"Almost every afternoon they would enter the coppice, and walk as far as the log.","几乎每个下午，他们都要去小灌木林，一直走到原木那里。"
"‘Well, she’s not there!’ he would think, ‘of course not!’","“唉，她不在！”他想着，“她怎么会在呢！”"
"And he would feel a little shorter, and drag his feet walking up the hill home, with his hand clapped to his left side.","这时他会觉得自己变矮了点儿，一边用手拍着左肋，一边拖着脚步上山回家。"
"Now and then the thought would move in him: ‘Did she come—or did I dream it?’ and he would stare at space, while the dog Balthasar stared at him.","他时不时会有这样的念头：“她真的来过吗——还是我做了场梦呢？”然后就会呆呆地望着空中，而小狗巴尔萨泽同样呆呆地望着他。"

"The carriage stopped before a small three-storied block of flats, standing a little back from the river.","马车在一幢三层小公寓前停下，公寓离河边不远。"
"With a practised eye old Jolyon saw that they were cheap.","以老乔利恩那老道的眼光来看，这房子档次不高。"
"‘I should think about sixty pound a year,’ he mused; and entering, he looked at the name-board.","“我猜也就六十镑一年吧。”他暗想；进门时，他朝住户的名牌看了看。"
"The name ‘Forsyte’ was not on it, but against ‘First Floor, Flat C’ were the words: ‘Mrs. Irene Heron.’","上面没有“福赛特”的字样，可在“二楼C室”后面写着“艾琳·希伦太太”。"

"Better not!","最好别去！"
"He did not wish to revive the echoes of the past on Forsyte ’Change.","他不想让福赛特交易所过去的流言死灰复燃。"
"He removed a white hair from the lapel of his closely-buttoned-up frock coat, and passed his hand over his cheeks, moustache, and square chin.","他从紧扣的长礼服翻领上捏下一根白头发，用手摸着自己的脸颊、胡须和方下巴。"

"Balance! The chap had no balance at all, if he remembered; as for symmetry—clean-built enough he was, no doubt; but those queer eyes of his, and high cheek-bones—Symmetry?","平衡！记忆中，这家伙毫无平衡可言；至于对称嘛——毫无疑问，他面容清秀，但是那双奇怪的眼睛还有那高高突起的颧骨——算得上对称吗？ "

"He’d be at his best with you.","和你在一起时，才是他状态最好的时候。"
"His ideas of art were a little new—to me”—he had stiffed the word ‘fangled.’","他对艺术的理解有点儿太新了——对我而言。”——“标新立异”这个词到了嘴边又被咽了回去。"
"“Yes: but he used to say you had a real sense of beauty.”","“嗯，但他常说您才是真正懂得欣赏美的人。”"
"Old Jolyon thought: ‘The devil he did!’ but answered with a twinkle: “Well, I have, or I shouldn’t be sitting here with you.”","老乔利恩心想：“他这么说才真见鬼了！”但又向她眨了眨眼睛说道：“当然啦，不然我就不会和一位美人坐在这儿了。”"

"“He thought you had one of those hearts that never grow old.","“他觉得您有颗永远不会变老的心。"
"Phil had real insight.”","菲尔很有眼光。”"
"He was not taken in by this flattery spoken out of the past, out of a longing to talk of her dead lover—not a bit; and yet it was precious to hear, because she pleased his eyes and heart which—quite true!—had never grown old.","这种恭维没有让他忘乎所以，一点儿也没有。他深知，这只是出于对过去的回忆，出于她想要谈论情人的渴望。然而这番话仍是非常中听，因为说这话的她是那样赏心悦目；的确，他的心从未变老。"
"Was that because—unlike her and her dead lover, he had never loved to desperation, had always kept his balance, his sense of symmetry.","这是不是因为，他不同于她和她的情人，从未撕心裂肺地爱过，而是一直保持着他的平衡、他的对称感？"
"Well! It had left him power, at eighty-four, to admire beauty.","好吧！这使他在八十四岁时，仍然能够欣赏美。"
"And he thought, ‘If I were a painter or a sculptor!","他想：“如果我是个画家或者雕刻家该多好啊！"

"With that glow in her pale face, her breast heaving, her eyes so large and dark and soft, she looked like Venus come to life!","她苍白的脸有了红润的气色，胸口起伏着，深邃的大眼睛里满是柔情，仿佛苏醒了的维纳斯！"
"But this extravagance brought instant reaction, and, twinkling, he said: “Well, if it had limits, we shouldn’t be born; for by George! it’s got a lot to put up with.”","不过，这番冲动之语立即引起反应，他眨了下眼睛，接着说：“如果有界限，我们就不会出生了；因为，天哪，爱情里我们要忍受多少东西啊。”"
"Then, removing his top hat, he brushed it round with a cuff.","接着，他脱下礼帽，用袖口掸了掸帽子边缘。"
"The great clumsy thing heated his forehead; in these days he often got a rush of blood to the head—his circulation was not what it had been.","这个又大又笨重的东西，弄得他前额发热；这些天他总感觉血往头顶冲——他的血压不比从前了。"

"She put her hand over them, took it away again, and went on calmly: “That night I went to the Embankment; a woman caught me by the dress.","她用手掩住嘴，又拿了下来，平静后接着说：“那晚我去了筑堤上；一个女人抓住了我的裙子。"
"She told me about herself.","她把她的故事告诉了我。"
"When one knows that others suffer, one’s ashamed.”","一个人若了解了其他人的苦痛，自己就会感到惭愧。”"
"“One of those?”","“是她们中的一个？”"
"She nodded, and horror stirred within old Jolyon, the horror of one who has never known a struggle with desperation.","她点点头。老乔利恩心中生出一种恐惧，是那种从未在绝望中挣扎过的人才会有的恐惧。"
"Almost against his will he muttered: “Tell me, won’t you?”","他违心地小声说道：“跟我说说吧。”"
"“I didn’t care whether I lived or died.","“我当时根本不在乎生死。"

"He stood, staring, and stroking that chin whose strength had frightened so many in its time.","他站着，一边出神，一边摸着下巴；想当年，他那坚挺的下巴不知吓坏了多少人。"
"The idea of her thus actually in contact with this outcast grieved and frightened him.","她真的在和流浪者接触，一想到这个，他就感到难过和害怕。"
"What could she do for them?","她能为她们做些什么？"
"Nothing.","什么也做不了。"
"Only soil and make trouble for herself, perhaps.","或许只会玷污她的名誉，给她带来麻烦。"
"And he said: “Take care, my dear!","他说：“孩子，要小心！"
"The world puts the worst construction on everything.”","人们总会恶意地揣测每件事。”"
"“I know that.”","“我明白。”"
"He was abashed by her quiet smile.","她淡然一笑，反而让他生出些尴尬。"
"“Well then—Sunday,” he murmured: “Good-bye.”","“那——周日见，”他低声说，“再见。”"
"She put her cheek forward for him to kiss.","她把脸颊凑过去，让他亲吻。"
"“Good-bye,” he said again; “take care of yourself.”","“再见，”他又说了一遍，“照顾好自己。”"

"The spirit of the future, with the charm of the unknown, put up her lips instead.","而未来的小精灵，却带着未知的魅力，献上了自己的柔唇。"
"Old Jolyon was not restless now, and paid no visits to the log, because she was coming to lunch.","老乔里恩现在不再觉得烦躁不安了，也不老去原木那边看了，因为她要来吃午饭。"
"There is wonderful finality about a meal; it removes a world of doubts, for no one misses meals except for reasons beyond control.","约人吃饭有一种奇妙的确定性，它能消散一切疑虑，因为没人愿意错过一顿饭，除非有他掌控不了的理由。"
"He played many games with Holly on the lawn, pitching them up to her who was batting so as to be ready to bowl to Jolly in the holidays.","他经常和霍利在草地上玩板球，他掷球，霍利击球，这样到了假期她就可以掷球给乔利。"
"For she was not a Forsyte, but Jolly was—and Forsytes always bat, until they have resigned and reached the age of eighty-five.","让霍利掷球是因为她并非福赛特家的人，但乔利是。福赛特家的人永远是击球的，直到他们退休，活到八十五岁为止。"
"The dog Balthasar, in attendance, lay on the ball as often as he could, and the page-boy fielded, till his face was like the harvest moon.","小狗巴尔萨泽在一旁服侍着，常常追着球跑。小家伙满场跑着，直到脸红得犹如晚霞一般。"
"And because the time was getting shorter, each day was longer and more golden than the last.","由于离星期天越来越近，每一天变得比前一天更长，也更加令人期待。"
"On Friday night he took a liver pill, his side hurt him rather, and though it was not the liver side, there is no remedy like that.","星期五的晚上他吃了一颗护肝药，因为他肋下疼痛不已，虽然不是在肝的一侧，但也没有比护肝药更好的选择了。"
"Anyone telling him that he had found a new excitement in life and that excitement was not good for him, would have been met by one of those steady and rather defiant looks of his deep-set iron-grey eyes, which seemed to say: ‘I know my own business best.’","如果这个时候有人跟他说，他找到了一种生活中的新鲜刺激，但这刺激对他无益，他那对深陷的铁灰色眼睛会流露出坚定且不屑一顾的神色，仿佛在说：“我自己的事情我自己最清楚。”"
"He always had and always would.","他一直都最清楚自己的事情，以后也是如此。"
"On Sunday morning, when Holly had gone with her governess to church, he visited the strawberry beds.","星期天的早晨，霍利和她的家庭教师去教堂了，老乔利恩去了草莓圃。"
"There, accompanied by the dog Balthasar, he examined the plants narrowly and succeeded in finding at least two dozen berries which were really ripe.","小狗巴尔萨泽陪着他，一株草莓一株草莓地仔细察看，终于找到两三打熟透了的草莓。"
"Stooping was not good for him, and he became very dizzy and red in the forehead.","一直弯着腰对他的身体无益，他感到头晕目眩，前额也泛红。"
"Having placed the strawberries in a dish on the dining-table, he washed his hands and bathed his forehead with eau de Cologne.","他把草莓摆到盘里，搁在餐桌上，然后洗了洗手，在额头上抹了点儿古龙水。"

"The air smelled sweet, larks sang, and the Grand Stand at Epsom was visible.","空气里飘荡着清香，云雀也放声歌唱，埃普索姆赛马场的大看台一目了然。"
"A perfect day!","真是完美的一天！"
"On just such a one, no doubt, six years ago, Soames had brought young Bosinney down with him to look at the site before they began to build.","毫无疑问，六年前也是这样的一天，在他们开始建房子之前，索姆斯曾带着小波辛尼一道来这里选址。"
"It was Bosinney who had pitched on the exact spot for the house—as June had often told him.","房子的具体位置是波辛尼选的——琼常常跟他说起这个。"
"In these days he was thinking much about that young fellow, as if his spirit were really haunting the field of his last work, on the chance of seeing—her.","这些日子他总是想起那个小伙子，仿佛他的灵魂依然在他最后一件作品附近游荡，期望有机会能够看见——她。"
"Bosinney—the one man who had possessed her heart, to whom she had given her whole self with rapture!","波辛尼——那唯一一个占据了她的心的人，她疯狂地将自己毫无保留地献予的人！"
"At his age one could not, of course, imagine such things, but there stirred in him a queer vague aching—as it were the ghost of an impersonal jealousy; and a feeling, too, more generous, of pity for that love so early lost.","当然，像他这样年纪的人是没法想象这种事的，但是他心里却涌起一种奇怪又模糊的痛苦——隐约的不带一丝个人感情的嫉妒。此外还有一种比较宽厚的怜悯之情，遗憾这段爱情这么快就结束了。"
"All over in a few poor months!","短短几个月就都结束了！"
"Well, well!","唉，唉！"
"He looked at his watch before entering the coppice—only a quarter past, twenty-five minutes to wait!","走进小树林前他看了看表——才十二点一刻，还要再等二十五分钟！"
"And then, turning the corner of the path, he saw her exactly where he had seen her the first time, on the log; and realised that she must have come by the earlier train to sit there alone for a couple of hours at least.","然后，转过小路，他就看见她了，恰好是第一次看到她的地方，她坐在那根原木上。他意识到她一定是坐上一班火车来的，想先来这里独自坐一会儿，至少已经坐了两个小时了。"
"Two hours of her society missed!","错过了可以和她相处的两个小时！"
"What memory could make that log so dear to her?","是什么样的回忆让她如此留恋这根原木？"
"His face showed what he was thinking, for she said at once:","他的表情表露出他的心思，她马上说："
"“Forgive me, Uncle Jolyon; it was here that I first knew.”","“非常抱歉，乔利恩伯伯。我是在这里认识——”"
"“Yes, yes; there it is for you whenever you like.","“哦，哦。你想来的时候随时都可以来。"
"You’re looking a little Londony; you’re giving too many lessons.”","你看上去有点儿疲倦，教课太多了吧。”"

"“Where do you go to give them?” he asked.","“你去哪儿教课？”他问道。"

"Old Jolyon stared; to all Forsytes Jews seem strange and doubtful.","老乔利恩睁大了眼睛，在所有福赛特家的人看来，犹太人都是陌生且令人生疑的。"
"“They love music, and they’re very kind.”","“他们都喜欢音乐，人也挺好。”"
"“They had better be, by George!”","“希望他们确实如此！”"
"He took her arm—his side always hurt him a little going uphill—and said:","他挽住她的手臂——上坡时他的左肋总是有点儿疼——他说："
"“Did you ever see anything like those buttercups?","“你见过这样的黄毛茛么？"
"They came like that in a night.”","它们一夜间就开成这样了。”"
"Her eyes seemed really to fly over the field, like bees after the flowers and the honey.","她的目光似乎真的飘过田野，就像蜜蜂追着鲜花与花蜜。"
"“I wanted you to see them—wouldn’t let them turn the cows in yet.”","“我想让你也看看这些花，所以还没有让他们把牛放出来。”"
"Then, remembering that she had come to talk about Bosinney, he pointed to the clock-tower over the stables:","他又想起她过来是为了说说波辛尼的事，于是指着马厩那边的钟塔说："
"“I expect he wouldn’t have let me put that there—had no notion of time, if I remember.”","“我想他肯定不会让我在那儿建钟塔——他没有一点儿时间观念，如果我没记错的话。”"
"But, pressing his arm to her, she talked of flowers instead, and he knew it was done that he might not feel she came because of her dead lover.","她把他的手臂挽得更紧一些，却转而谈起花来。他很清楚，她这样做是为了不让他觉得，她自己来这里就是为了她那逝去的情人。"
"“The best flower I can show you,” he said, with a sort of triumph, “is my little sweet.","“我能给你看的最美的花儿，”他略带得意地说，“就是我的小甜心。"
"She’ll be back from Church directly.","她马上就要从教堂回来了。"
"There’s something about her which reminds me a little of you,” and it did not seem to him peculiar that he had put it thus, instead of saying: “There’s something about you which reminds me a little of her.”","我觉得她某些地方有点儿像你。”他本应该说，“我觉得你某些地方有点儿像她。”但他并没觉得这样反过来说有什么奇怪的。"
"Ah! And here she was!","啊！她回来了！"
"Holly, followed closely by her elderly French governess, whose digestion had been ruined twenty-two years ago in the siege of Strasbourg, came rushing towards them from under the oak tree.","霍利从橡树下跑过来，后面紧跟着她上了年纪的法国女教师，二十二年前斯特拉斯堡被围的时候，她的胃就出了问题。"
"She stopped about a dozen yards away, to pat Balthasar and pretend that this was all she had in her mind.","她在大约十二码远的地方停了下来，轻拍着巴尔萨泽，假装她想的就这一件事。"
"Old Jolyon, who knew better, said:","她的心思老乔利恩再明白不过了，他于是说："
"“Well, my darling, here’s the lady in grey I promised you.”","“来，亲爱的，这就是我答应过给你介绍的那位灰衣服女士。”"
"Holly raised herself and looked up.","霍利直起身子，抬头看她。"
"He watched the two of them with a twinkle, Irene smiling, Holly beginning with grave inquiry, passing into a shy smile too, and then to something deeper.","他看着她们俩，眼睛闪着光。艾琳笑着，霍利刚开始一本正经地问好，接着也露出了羞涩的微笑，然后笑意越来越浓。"
"She had a sense of beauty, that child—knew what was what!","她知道什么是美，这孩子——眼光很好！"
"He enjoyed the sight of the kiss between them.","他很享受地看着她们互相亲吻。"
"“Mrs. Heron, Mam’zelle Beauce.","“这位是希伦太太，这位是博斯小姐。"
"Well, Mam’zelle—good sermon?”","博斯小姐——今天的布道不错吧？”"
"For, now that he had not much more time before him, the only part of the service connected with this world absorbed what interest in church remained to him.","他现在剩下的时间不多了，对教堂仅剩的兴趣就是唯一与这个世界有联系的布道仪式了。"
"Mam’zelle Beauce stretched out a spidery hand clad in a black kid glove—she had been in the best families—and the rather sad eyes of her lean yellowish face seemed to ask: “Are you well-brrred?”","博斯小姐伸出戴着黑色羊羔皮手套的细长的手——她在一些最优越的家庭呆过——她那暗黄瘦削的脸上，一双充满悲伤的眼睛似乎在问：“你受过好的教育吗？”"
"Whenever Holly or Jolly did anything unpleasing to her—a not uncommon occurrence—she would say to them: “The little Tayleurs never did that—they were such well-brrred little children.”","不管霍利或者乔利做了什么让她不开心的事情——这是常事——她都会对他们说：“泰罗尔家的孩子们从来不会这样做——他们都是非常有教养的小孩。”"
"Jolly hated the little Tayleurs; Holly wondered dreadfully how it was she fell so short of them.","乔利讨厌泰罗尔家的小孩；霍利怎么也搞不懂自己为什么总比不上他们。"
"‘A thin rum little soul,’ old Jolyon thought her—Mam’zelle Beauce.","“瘦小古怪的人儿。”老乔利恩这样评价她——博斯小姐。"
"Luncheon was a successful meal, the mushrooms which he himself had picked in the mushroom house, his chosen strawberries, and another bottle of the Steinberg cabinet filled him with a certain aromatic spirituality, and a conviction that he would have a touch of eczema to-morrow.","午餐很成功，蘑菇是老乔利恩自己在蘑菇棚里摘的，草莓也是他亲自挑的，而又一瓶施泰因贝格秘制酒，让他腹中芳香，心神荡漾，也让他觉得明天定要犯湿疹了。"
"After lunch they sat under the oak tree drinking Turkish coffee.","午饭后，他们坐在橡树下喝土耳其咖啡。"
"It was no matter of grief to him when Mademoiselle Beauce withdrew to write her Sunday letter to her sister, whose future had been endangered in the past by swallowing a pin—an event held up daily in warning to the children to eat slowly and digest what they had eaten.","博斯小姐先告辞了，老乔利恩一点儿不觉得遗憾。她每周日都要给姐姐写信。她的姐姐曾经吞下一枚大头针，那之后的日子就变得艰难起来。博塞小姐每天都会拿这件事当例子，告诫孩子们吃饭要细嚼慢咽，以助于消化。"
"At the foot of the bank, on a carriage rug, Holly and the dog Balthasar teased and loved each other, and in the shade old Jolyon with his legs crossed and his cigar luxuriously savoured, gazed at Irene sitting in the swing.","斜坡下面的车毯上，霍利和小狗巴尔萨泽在亲热地嬉戏。树阴下，老乔利恩翘着腿，纵情品味着雪茄，注视着坐在秋千上的艾琳。"
"A light, vaguely swaying, grey figure with a fleck of sunlight here and there upon it, lips just opened, eyes dark and soft under lids a little drooped.","轻盈的灰色身影在微微晃动，阳光点点落在她身上，嘴唇微张，稍稍下垂的眼睑下是一双温柔的深色眼睛。"
"She looked content; surely it did her good to come and see him!","她看起来很满足；来看他确实让她觉得很好！"
"The selfishness of age had not set its proper grip on him, for he could still feel pleasure in the pleasure of others, realising that what he wanted, though much, was not quite all that mattered.","年老带来的自私还没完全将他控制，他还能为别人的快乐而快乐，他意识到尽管他想要的东西很多，但并不都是最重要的。"
"“It’s quiet here,” he said; “you mustn’t come down if you find it dull.","“这儿很安静，”他说，“你要是觉得无趣，也不必非要下来。"
"But it’s a pleasure to see you.","不过能看到你我很高兴。"
"My little sweet is the only face which gives me any pleasure, except yours.”","我的小甜心是唯一让我感到开心的脸蛋，你的也是。”"
"From her smile he knew that she was not beyond liking to be appreciated, and this reassured him.","从她的笑容，他看得出她与常人无异，也喜欢被赞赏，这就让他放心了。"
"“That’s not humbug,” he said.","“这不是哄你，”他说，"
"“I never told a woman I admired her when I didn’t.","“我从不对我不喜欢的女人说喜欢。"
"In fact I don’t know when I’ve told a woman I admired her, except my wife in the old days; and wives are funny.”","其实，我都不记得什么时候跟女人说过我喜欢她了，以前会对我妻子说，不过当妻子的都很有趣。”"
"He was silent, but resumed abruptly:","他停了下来，又突然说："
"“She used to expect me to say it more often than I felt it, and there we were.”","“她总想让我多说，我不想说的时候还让我说，我们也就那样了。”"
"Her face looked mysteriously troubled, and, afraid that he had said something painful, he hurried on: “When my little sweet marries, I hope she’ll find someone who knows what women feel.","她一脸困惑，觉得他的话难以理解；他害怕自己说了一些让她痛苦的东西，急忙又说：“我的小甜心结婚时，我希望她能找到一个懂得女人心思的人。"
"I shan’t be here to see it, but there’s too much topsy-turvydom in marriage; I don’t want her to pitch up against that.”","我是看不到那一天了，但是婚姻中实在有太多颠三倒四的东西，我不想她遇到那些。”"
"And, aware that he had made bad worse, he added: “That dog will scratch.”","意识到自己越说越糟糕，他忙岔开了：“这狗要挠痒痒了。”"
"A silence followed.","接着是一阵沉默。"
"Of what was she thinking, this pretty creature whose life was spoiled; who had done with love, and yet was made for love?","她在想什么？这个尤物，她的生活被毁了，她的爱情已经结束，可她又是为爱而生。"
"Some day when he was gone, perhaps, she would find another mate—not so disorderly as that young fellow who had got himself run over.","等他不在了，或许某天她会找到另一个伴侣——不像那个年轻人一样乱糟糟的，让他自己被车碾过。"
"Ah! but her husband?","啊，那她的丈夫呢？"
"“Does Soames never trouble you?” he asked.","“索姆斯没有再纠缠你吗？”他问。"
"She shook her head.","她摇了摇头。"
"Her face had closed up suddenly.","脸顿时沉了下来。"
"For all her softness there was something irreconcilable about her.","尽管她很温顺，在有些问题上却绝不退让。"
"And a glimpse of light on the inexorable nature of sex antipathies strayed into a brain which, belonging to early Victorian civilisation—so much older than this of his old age—had never thought about such primitive things.","这让老乔利恩第一次意识到了两性间的憎恶是如此决绝。他那维多利亚时代早期的头脑——比现在的时代还要古老得多——以前从没考虑过这些原始的问题。"
"“That’s a comfort,” he said.","“那还不错。”他说，"
"“You can see the Grand Stand to-day.","“今天你可以望见大看台。"
"Shall we take a turn round?”","我们去转转吧？”"
"Through the flower and fruit garden, against whose high outer walls peach trees and nectarines were trained to the sun, through the stables, the vinery, the mushroom house, the asparagus beds, the rosery, the summer-house, he conducted her—even into the kitchen garden to see the tiny green peas which Holly loved to scoop out of their pods with her finger, and lick up from the palm of her little brown hand.","他带她穿过种着鲜花和水果的园子，桃树和油桃树的树枝为了阳光探出了园子高高的围墙；他们穿过马厩、葡萄园、蘑菇棚、芦笋田、玫瑰园和凉亭，还去了菜园看细小的青豌豆；霍利喜欢用手指把豆荚里的豆子抠出来，然后放在棕色的小手心中舔。"
"Many delightful things he showed her, while Holly and the dog Balthasar danced ahead, or came to them at intervals for attention.","他带她看了很多令人愉快的东西，霍利和小狗巴尔萨泽则在前面蹦蹦跳跳，不时跑过来吸引他们的注意。"
"It was one of the happiest afternoons he had ever spent, but it tired him and he was glad to sit down in the music room and let her give him tea.","这是他度过的最开心的一个下午，但也让他感到疲惫，于是回到音乐室后，他开心地坐下来，让她给他倒杯茶。"
"A special little friend of Holly’s had come in—a fair child with short hair like a boy’s.","霍利一个特别要好的小朋友进来了——一个皮肤白皙的小女孩，留着男孩子一样的短发。"
"And the two sported in the distance, under the stairs, on the stairs, and up in the gallery.","两个孩子在远处游戏，有时在楼梯下，有时在楼梯上，有时又跑到了楼上的走廊里。"
"Old Jolyon begged for Chopin.","老乔利恩让艾琳弹肖邦的曲子。"
"She played studies, mazurkas, waltzes, till the two children, creeping near, stood at the foot of the piano their dark and golden heads bent forward, listening.","她弹了练习曲，玛祖卡和华尔兹。她弹到后来，两个孩子悄悄走了过来，站在钢琴旁，向前伸着她们黑发和金发的小脑袋，仔细听着。"
"Old Jolyon watched.","老乔利恩在一旁看着。"
"“Let’s see you dance, you two!”","“跳个舞吧，你们俩！”"
"Shyly, with a false start, they began.","她们害羞地跳了起来，开头的步子就迈错了。"
"Bobbing and circling, earnest, not very adroit, they went past and past his chair to the strains of that waltz.","她们舞动着、旋转着，虽然不太灵巧但很认真，跟着华尔兹的旋律，一次次地经过他的椅子。"
"He watched them and the face of her who was playing turned smiling towards those little dancers thinking:","他看着她们，还有艾琳的脸；她正在弹琴，朝着小舞者们微笑。他心想："
"‘Sweetest picture I’ve seen for ages.’","“多少年没见到如此美妙的画面了。”"
"A voice said:","一个法国声音叫道："
"“Hollee!","“霍利！"
"Mais enfin—qu’est-ce que tu fais la—danser, le dimanche!","你们在那儿干嘛？跳舞？今天可是周日！"
"Viens, donc!”","过来！”"
"But the children came close to old Jolyon, knowing that he would save them, and gazed into a face which was decidedly ‘caught out.’","可孩子们都凑到老乔利恩身边，知道他会护着她们，看着他故意做出一副“被逮到了”的表情。"
"“Better the day, better the deed, Mam’zelle.","“良辰做美事，小姐。"
"It’s all my doing.","是我让她们跳的。"
"Trot along, chicks, and have your tea.”","去吧，小家伙们，去喝茶吧。”"
"And, when they were gone, followed by the dog Balthasar, who took every meal, he looked at Irene with a twinkle and said:","她们出去了，小狗巴尔萨泽也跟了过去，它可一顿都不落下。他目光闪闪地看着艾琳，说："
"“Well, there we are!","“就剩我们了！"
"Aren’t they sweet?","看她们多可爱！"
"Have you any little ones among your pupils?”","你的学生中有没有这样的小家伙？”"
"“Yes, three—two of them darlings.”","“嗯，有两三个很招人喜欢。”"
"“Pretty?”","“漂亮吗？”"
"“Lovely!”","“可爱得很！”"
"Old Jolyon sighed; he had an insatiable appetite for the very young.","老乔利恩叹了口气，他永远看不厌小孩子。"
"“My little sweet,” he said, “is devoted to music; she’ll be a musician some day.","“我的小甜心，”他说，“特别喜欢音乐，总有一天会成为音乐家。"
"You wouldn’t give me your opinion of her playing, I suppose?”","我想你不会介意听听她弹得怎么样吧？” "
"“Of course I will.”","“当然不。”"
"“You wouldn’t like—” but he stifled the words “to give her lessons.”","“那你愿不愿意——”他没说出下面的“给她上课”。"
"The idea that she gave lessons was unpleasant to him; yet it would mean that he would see her regularly.","他不太喜欢让她教课这个念头，但这意味着他可以经常看到她。"
"She left the piano and came over to his chair.","她离开钢琴，来到他椅子旁。"
"“I would like, very much; but there is—June.","“我愿意，非常愿意，可问题是——琼。"
"When are they coming back?”","他们什么时候回来？”"
"Old Jolyon frowned.","老乔利恩皱起了眉头："
"“Not till the middle of next month.","“下月中旬才回来。"
"What does that matter?”","那又怎样？”"
"“You said June had forgiven me; but she could never forget, Uncle Jolyon.”","“您说琼已经原谅我了；可她永远不会忘记，乔利恩伯伯。”"
"Forget! She must forget, if he wanted her to.","忘记！她必须忘记，如果他要她这么做的话。"
"But as if answering, Irene shook her head.","可艾琳像是在回答似的摇了摇头。"
"“You know she couldn’t; one doesn’t forget.”","“您知道她不会；人是不会忘记的。”"
"Always that wretched past!","总是那段讨厌的过去！"
"And he said with a sort of vexed finality:","他有些恼怒地下了结论："
"“Well, we shall see.”","“好吧，以后再说吧。”"
"He talked to her an hour or more, of the children, and a hundred little things, till the carriage came round to take her home.","他和她又谈了一个多小时，谈孩子们，还有很多琐事，直到马车来接她回家。"
"And when she had gone he went back to his chair, and sat there smoothing his face and chin, dreaming over the day.","她离开后，他回到自己的椅子，坐在那里摩挲着脸和下巴，回味着这一天。"
"That evening after dinner he went to his study and took a sheet of paper.","那天晚饭后，他去了书房，拿出一张纸。"
"He stayed for some minutes without writing, then rose and stood under the masterpiece ‘Dutch Fishing Boats at Sunset.’","他坐了几分钟，什么也没写，接着起身，在名画《日暮时分的荷兰渔船》下站着。"
"He was not thinking of that picture, but of his life.","他想的不是这幅画，而是自己的人生。"
"He was going to leave her something in his Will; nothing could so have stirred the stilly deeps of thought and memory.","他要在遗嘱中给她留下些东西，没有哪件事能像这个念头一样深深搅动他思绪与记忆深处的宁静。"
"He was going to leave her a portion of his wealth, of his aspirations, deeds, qualities, work—all that had made that wealth; going to leave her, too, a part of all he had missed in life, by his sane and steady pursuit of wealth.","他要给她留一些财产，一些自己的抱负、作为、品质和工作——所有帮他获得那些财产的东西。他还要给她留一点儿所有那些他在生命中错过了的东西，由于自己理性而执著地追寻财富而错过的东西。"
"All! What had he missed?","所有那些！他都错过了什么？"
"‘Dutch Fishing Boats’ responded blankly; he crossed to the French window, and drawing the curtain aside, opened it.","《荷兰渔船》沉默不语，他走到落地窗前，拉开窗帘，打开窗子。"
"A wind had got up, and one of last year’s oak leaves which had somehow survived the gardener’s brooms, was dragging itself with a tiny clicking rustle along the stone terrace in the twilight.","起风了，暮色中，一片去年不知如何逃过园丁扫把的橡树叶，在石铺的露台上被风刮着走，发出簌簌的声响。"
"Except for that it was very quiet out there, and he could smell the heliotrope watered not long since.","除此之外，周围一片寂静，他甚至能闻到天芥菜刚刚浇过水的气息。"

"Nothing left to do but enjoy beauty from afar off while you could, and leave it something in your Will.","能做的只有在尚在人世的时候远远地欣赏一下美人，然后在遗嘱中为她留下点什么。"
"But how much?","可是留多少？"
"And, as if he could not make that calculation looking out into the mild freedom of the country night, he turned back and went up to the chimney-piece.","乡村柔和的夜晚让人觉得轻松自在；就像望着夜色无法计算一样，他转过身来，走到壁炉旁。"
"There were his pet bronzes—a Cleopatra with the asp at her breast; a Socrates; a greyhound playing with her puppy; a strong man reining in some horses.","那里有他喜爱的铜像——胸前绕着毒蛇的克莱奥帕特拉、苏格拉底、正和幼犬玩耍的灵缇犬，还有一个驾着几匹马的壮汉。"
"‘They last!’ he thought, and a pang went through his heart.","“它们不会死！”他想着，心中一痛。"
"They had a thousand years of life before them!","它们还能活几千年！"
"‘How much?’ Well! enough at all events to save her getting old before her time, to keep the lines out of her face as long as possible, and grey from soiling that bright hair.","“留多少？”至少要够她生活，使她不会韶华早逝，尽量不让皱纹早早就爬上她的脸，也不让银丝玷污她的秀发。"
"He might live another five years.","他可能还能活五年。"
"She would be well over thirty by then.","那时她就30多岁了。"
"‘How much?’","“留多少？”"
"She had none of his blood in her!","她和他没有血缘关系！"
"In loyalty to the tenor of his life for forty years and more, ever since he married and founded that mysterious thing, a family, came this warning thought—None of his blood, no right to anything!","自他结婚并建立那个神秘的事物——家，已有四十多年。这些年来，他一直遵循生活的准则，现在这一准则发出了警告——和他没有血缘关系的，无权继承任何东西！"
"It was a luxury then, this notion.","那这个想法就是一种奢侈。"
"An extravagance, a petting of an old man’s whim, one of those things done in dotage.","它是一种挥霍，是对老年人突发奇想的放纵，是年老昏聩才会做的事情。"
"His real future was vested in those who had his blood, in whom he would live on when he was gone.","他真正的未来寄托于身体里流淌着自己血液的后代，他死后，生命将在他们身上延续。"
"He turned away from the bronzes and stood looking at the old leather chair in which he had sat and smoked so many hundreds of cigars.","他从铜像转过身，站在那里望着那张旧皮椅，他曾坐在那里抽了几百只雪茄。"
"And suddenly he seemed to see her sitting there in her grey dress, fragrant, soft, dark-eyed, graceful, looking up at him.","突然间，他仿佛看到她就坐在那里，穿着灰色裙子，散发着淡淡香气，温柔而又高雅，正抬起头用那双深色眼睛望着他。"
"Why! She cared nothing for him, really; all she cared for was that lost lover of hers.","为什么要给！她根本不在乎他，不是吗？她挂念的只是死去的情人。"
"But she was there, whether she would or no, giving him pleasure with her beauty and grace.","可是不管她愿不愿意，她就在那里，用自己的美丽和优雅使他开心。"
"One had no right to inflict an old man’s company, no right to ask her down to play to him and let him look at her—for no reward!","人没有权利硬让她陪着一个老人，没有权利要求她坐下来为他弹琴，允许他欣赏她，却不给她任何回报！"
"Pleasure must be paid for in this world.","这个世界没有免费的快乐可得。"
"‘How much?’ After all, there was plenty; his son and his three grandchildren would never miss that little lump.","“留多少？”不管怎么说，他有很多钱；他的儿子和三个孙儿永远不会介意少了这一小部分。"
"He had made it himself, nearly every penny; he could leave it where he liked, allow himself this little pleasure.","所有的钱都是他自己挣的，几乎每一分都是。他想给谁就给谁，应该满足自己的这点儿愿望。"
"He went back to the bureau.","他回到桌前。"
"‘Well, I’m going to,’ he thought, ‘let them think what they like.","“我要给，”他想，“随他们怎么想。”"
"I’m going to!’ And he sat down.","“我要给！”他坐了下来。"
"‘How much?’","“给多少？”"
"Ten thousand, twenty thousand—how much?","一万，两万——给多少？"
"If only with his money he could buy one year, one month of youth.","要是他能用这些钱，换回一年、哪怕一个月的青春，该多好。"
"And startled by that thought, he wrote quickly:","他为自己这个想法吃了一惊，于是快速写道："
"‘DEAR HERRING,—Draw me a codicil to this effect: “I leave to my niece Irene Forsyte, born Irene Heron, by which name she now goes, fifteen thousand pounds free of legacy duty.” ‘Yours faithfully, ‘JOLYON FORSYTE.’","“希林先生：请为我添加一条遗嘱：‘留给我侄媳艾琳·福赛特，闺名艾琳·希伦，即她目前使用的名字，一万五千镑遗产，不含遗产税。’您忠实的‘乔利恩·福赛特’。”"
"When he had sealed and stamped the envelope, he went back to the window and drew in a long breath.","他把信口封好，贴上邮票，然后走回窗前，长长地舒了口气。"
"It was dark, but many stars shone now.","天已经黑了，但夜空中已繁星点点。"

"IV","4.0"
"He woke at half-past two, an hour which long experience had taught him brings panic intensity to all awkward thoughts.","夜里两点半他就醒了。长久以来的经验告诉他，这个时间醒来，会让他各种奇怪的想法尤为强烈，让他恐慌。"
"Experience had also taught him that a further waking at the proper hour of eight showed the folly of such panic.","过去的经验还告诉他，当早上八点他再次醒来时，会觉得夜半的恐慌是那么愚蠢。"
"On this particular morning the thought which gathered rapid momentum was that if he became ill, at his age not improbable, he would not see her.","这个特别的夜里，一个让他越发担忧的想法是，要是他病倒了，就不能见到她了，而在他这个年纪病倒并非不可能。"
"From this it was but a step to realisation that he would be cut off, too, when his son and June returned from Spain.","从这一点，他很容易就又想到，等儿子和琼从西班牙回来，他也同样不能和她见面了。"
"How could he justify desire for the company of one who had stolen—early morning does not mince words—June’s lover?","这样深的夜里，何不坦诚一点儿：那个女人抢走了琼的爱人，而他居然渴望她的陪伴，他能如何为自己辩解？"
"That lover was dead; but June was a stubborn little thing; warm-hearted, but stubborn as wood, and—quite true—not one who forgot!","那个情人已经死了，但琼是个固执的丫头，热心肠，但固执得像块石头，而且——确实——是不太会忘记的！"
"By the middle of next month they would be back.","下个月中旬，他们就要回来了。"
"He had barely five weeks left to enjoy the new interest which had come into what remained of his life.","他只剩不到五个星期的时间来享受这点儿他余生里的新乐趣了。"
"Darkness showed up to him absurdly clear the nature of his feeling.","黑暗反而更让他看清了自己这种感觉的本质。"
"Admiration for beauty—a craving to see that which delighted his eyes.","那是对美的倾慕——渴望看到悦目的东西。"
"Preposterous, at his age!","可是他这把年纪了，真是荒唐！"
"And yet—what other reason was there for asking June to undergo such painful reminder, and how prevent his son and his son’s wife from thinking him very queer?","可是除此之外，他又有什么理由能要求琼承受这痛苦的回忆，不让儿子儿媳把他当成个怪老头呢？"
"He would be reduced to sneaking up to London, which tired him; and the least indisposition would cut him off even from that.","他可能得偷偷溜去伦敦见她，可这会让他太劳累；若是得了一点儿小病，就连这样也不可能了。"
"He lay with eyes open, setting his jaw against the prospect, and calling himself an old fool, while his heart beat loudly, and then seemed to stop beating altogether.","他躺在那里，眼睛睁着，牙关紧咬着想到这一前景，骂自己是老糊涂了，他的心脏剧烈地跳着，一会儿仿佛又一下子停止了跳动。"
"He had seen the dawn lighting the window chinks, heard the birds chirp and twitter, and the cocks crow, before he fell asleep again, and awoke tired but sane.","他看到晨曦照进窗子的缝隙，听到鸟叽叽喳喳、公鸡打鸣，才又睡着了；再醒来时感觉疲惫但清醒。"
"Five weeks before he need bother, at his age an eternity!","至少这五个星期他不必担忧；在他这个年纪，五个星期抵得上永远！"
"But that early morning panic had left its mark, had slightly fevered the will of one who had always had his own way.","不过，深夜醒来时的恐慌还是留下了痕迹，让他这个行事一向随心所欲的人意愿更坚定了些。"
"He would see her as often as he wished!","他要见她，想见几次就见几次！"
"Why not go up to town and make that codicil at his solicitor’s instead of writing about it; she might like to go to the opera!","为什么不直接去城里找他的律师添加遗嘱而要写信呢？她可能会想看歌剧！"
"But, by train, for he would not have that fat chap Beacon grinning behind his back.","但是要坐火车去，他可不想让比肯那个胖家伙背着他窃笑。"
"Servants were such fools; and, as likely as not, they had known all the past history of Irene and young Bosinney—servants knew everything, and suspected the rest.","佣人们都是些这样的傻瓜，而且说不定他们已经对艾琳和波辛尼的那段旧事一清二楚——佣人们什么都知道，不知道的他们也会乱猜。"
"He wrote to her that morning:","那天早上他给她写了张便条："
"“MY DEAR IRENE,—I have to be up in town to-morrow.","“亲爱的艾琳：明天我会进城去。"
"If you would like to have a look in at the opera, come and dine with me quietly ....”","你要是想去看场歌剧，可以悄悄地出来和我一起吃顿晚饭……”"
"But where?","但去哪里吃呢？"
"It was decades since he had dined anywhere in London save at his Club or at a private house.","这几十年来，除了在他自己的俱乐部或者私人住所，他没在伦敦别的地方吃过饭。"
"Ah! that new-fangled place close to Covent Garden....","对了！可以去科文特加登附近那家新潮的饭店……"
"“Let me have a line to-morrow morning to the Piedmont Hotel whether to expect you there at 7 o’clock.","“我明晚七点在皮德蒙特饭店等你可以，明早在那儿留张便条告诉我。"
"“Yours affectionately,","你亲爱的，"
"“JOLYON FORSYTE.”","乔利恩·福赛特。”"
"She would understand that he just wanted to give her a little pleasure; for the idea that she should guess he had this itch to see her was instinctively unpleasant to him; it was not seemly that one so old should go out of his way to see beauty, especially in a woman.","她应该明白，他只是想让她高兴一点儿；他不想她猜到自己是这么渴望见到她，这想法让他本能地感到厌恶。如此年迈的老人还这样费心地去欣赏美，尤其是一个女人的美，总是不太合适的。"
"The journey next day, short though it was, and the visit to his lawyer’s, tired him.","第二天进城的路程虽然不远，加上去见律师那一趟，却已经让他觉得累了。"
"It was hot too, and after dressing for dinner he lay down on the sofa in his bedroom to rest a little.","天气又热，换好晚餐的衣服后，他在卧室的沙发上躺下休息了一会儿。"
"He must have had a sort of fainting fit, for he came to himself feeling very queer; and with some difficulty rose and rang the bell.","醒来时他感觉很不对，觉得自己刚刚一定是晕过去了，他艰难地起身按了下铃。"
"Why! it was past seven!","啊，已经七点多了！"
"And there he was and she would be waiting.","他还在这里，她肯定在等了。"
"But suddenly the dizziness came on again, and he was obliged to relapse on the sofa.","可突然又是一阵眩晕，他不得不躺回沙发上。"
"He heard the maid’s voice say:","他听到女佣的声音："
"“Did you ring, sir?”","“您按铃了吗，先生？”"
"“Yes, come here”; he could not see her clearly, for the cloud in front of his eyes.","“是的，过来。”眼前的浑浊让他视线模糊，看不清她，"
"“I’m not well, I want some sal volatile.”","“我不大舒服，给我拿些提神药来。”"
"“Yes, sir.” Her voice sounded frightened.","“好的，先生。”从声音听得出她有些害怕。"
"Old Jolyon made an effort.","老乔利恩使了使劲。"
"“Don’t go.","“等等。"
"Take this message to my niece—a lady waiting in the hall—a lady in grey.","给我侄媳捎个信儿，她正在大厅等着，穿着灰色衣服。"
"Say Mr. Forsyte is not well—the heat.","跟她说天气太热了，福赛特先生不太舒服。"
"He is very sorry; if he is not down directly, she is not to wait dinner.”","就说他很抱歉，要是过会儿他还没下去，就不要等他一起吃晚饭了。”"
"When she was gone, he thought feebly: ‘Why did I say a lady in grey—she may be in anything.","女佣走后，他虚弱无力地想：“为什么要说她穿着灰衣服呢——她穿什么都有可能啊。"
"Sal volatile!’","提神药！”"
"He did not go off again, yet was not conscious of how Irene came to be standing beside him, holding smelling salts to his nose, and pushing a pillow up behind his head.","他没再晕过去，却也没意识到艾琳是如何走到了他身边，拿提神药给他闻，并在他头下垫了个枕头的。"
"He heard her say anxiously: “Dear Uncle Jolyon, what is it?” was dimly conscious of the soft pressure of her lips on his hand; then drew a long breath of smelling salts, suddenly discovered strength in them, and sneezed.","他听到她焦急地说：“亲爱的乔利恩伯伯，您是怎么了？”他隐约感觉到她的嘴唇轻触他的手背，然后他深深吸了一口提神药，突然感觉有了力气，打了个喷嚏。"
"“Ha!” he said, “it’s nothing.","“哈！”他说，“没什么。"
"How did you get here?","你怎么上来了？"
"Go down and dine—the tickets are on the dressing-table.","先下去吃饭——歌剧的票在梳妆台上。"
"I shall be all right in a minute.”","我马上就好。”"
"He felt her cool hand on his forehead, smelled violets, and sat divided between a sort of pleasure and a determination to be all right.","他感觉到她微凉的手放在自己的额头上，他闻到了紫罗兰香，坐在那里一面觉得喜悦，一面想他一定要好起来。"
"“Why!","“怎么！"
"You are in grey!” he said.","你真的穿着灰色衣服！”他说，"
"“Help me up.”","“扶我起来。”"
"Once on his feet he gave himself a shake.","一站起来他就抖了抖身子。"
"“What business had I to go off like that!”","“我怎么能就那样晕过去呢！”"
"And he moved very slowly to the glass.","他慢慢地走向镜子。"
"What a cadaverous chap!","这个老家伙的面色多么惨白！"
"Her voice, behind him, murmured:","在他身后，艾琳轻声说："
"“You mustn’t come down, Uncle; you must rest.”","“您不能下去了，伯伯。您得休息。”"
"“Fiddlesticks!","“瞎说！"
"A glass of champagne’ll soon set me to rights.","来一杯香槟我就没事了。"
"I can’t have you missing the opera.”","我可不能让你错过这场歌剧。”"
"But the journey down the corridor was troublesome.","但是过道那段路却很恼人。"
"What carpets they had in these newfangled places, so thick that you tripped up in them at every step!","他们这种新潮的地方铺的都是些什么地毯啊，那么厚，每走一步都会绊到脚！"
"In the lift he noticed how concerned she looked, and said with the ghost of a twinkle:","在电梯里，注意到艾琳那么担心，他眼睛里闪过一丝亮光，说道："
"“I’m a pretty host.”","“看我这主人当的。”"
"When the lift stopped he had to hold firmly to the seat to prevent its slipping under him; but after soup and a glass of champagne he felt much better, and began to enjoy an infirmity which had brought such solicitude into her manner towards him.","电梯停下来时他不得不紧紧抓住座位，以防自己从椅子上滑下去。不过在喝过汤和一杯香槟之后，他感觉好多了，并且开始享受这种因为身体虚弱而备受艾琳关心的感觉。"
"“I should have liked you for a daughter,” he said suddenly; and watching the smile in her eyes, went on:","“我希望有你这样一个女儿。”他突然说道；看到她眼里的笑意，他又接着说："
"“You mustn’t get wrapped up in the past at your time of life; plenty of that when you get to my age.","“在你这样的年龄，千万别纠缠于过去；等到了我这个年纪，就尽是回忆过去了。"
"That’s a nice dress—I like the style.”","这裙子很漂亮——我喜欢这款式。”"
"“I made it myself.”","“是我自己做的。”"
"Ah! A woman who could make herself a pretty frock had not lost her interest in life.","啊！如果一个女人还会给自己裁制漂亮衣服，那她就没对生活失去热情。"
"“Make hay while the sun shines,” he said; “and drink that up.","“趁年轻享受眼前良辰美景，”他说，“干了这一杯。"
"I want to see some colour in your cheeks.","我想看你脸上泛红的样子。"
"We mustn’t waste life; it doesn’t do.","我们不能浪费生命，千万不能。"
"There’s a new Marguerite to-night; let’s hope she won’t be fat.","今晚演玛格丽特地换了个人，希望她别太胖。"
"And Mephisto—anything more dreadful than a fat chap playing the Devil I can’t imagine.”","还有墨菲斯托——我想象不出比让一个胖子去演魔鬼更可怕的事情。”"
"But they did not go to the opera after all, for in getting up from dinner the dizziness came over him again, and she insisted on his staying quiet and going to bed early.","但他们终究还是没看成歌剧，因为吃完饭刚要站起来，他就又感到一阵眩晕，她坚持让他安静地呆着，早点儿上床休息。"
"When he parted from her at the door of the hotel, having paid the cabman to drive her to Chelsea, he sat down again for a moment to enjoy the memory of her words: “You are such a darling to me, Uncle Jolyon!”","他们在饭店门口分别，他为她叫了一辆车送她去切尔西,并提前付了车费。送走她之后，他又坐了一会儿，回味她说的话：“您对我可真好，乔利恩伯伯！”"
"Why! Who wouldn’t be!","可不是呢！谁不想对你好！"
"He would have liked to stay up another day and take her to the Zoo, but two days running of him would bore her to death.","他想在城里再呆一天，带她去动物园，但是连续两天都陪着他，她定会烦死的。"
"No, he must wait till next Sunday; she had promised to come then.","不行，他得等到下周日，她答应那天会来。"
"They would settle those lessons for Holly, if only for a month.","到时可以把教霍利钢琴的事定下来，哪怕只有一个月也好。"
"It would be something.","这不会那么容易。"
"That little Mam’zelle Beauce wouldn’t like it, but she would have to lump it.","博塞小姐不会乐意的，但她得忍着。"
"And crushing his old opera hat against his chest he sought the lift.","他把旧礼帽紧压在胸前，朝电梯走去。"
"He drove to Waterloo next morning, struggling with a desire to say: ‘Drive me to Chelsea.’ But his sense of proportion was too strong.","第二天早上他坐车去滑铁卢，强压住心里想说“把我送到切尔西”的念头，他还是能很好地把握事情的轻重缓急。"
"Besides, he still felt shaky, and did not want to risk another aberration like that of last night, away from home.","另外，他仍感到有些虚弱，可不想冒险再像昨晚那样失常，这可不是在家里。"
"Holly, too, was expecting him, and what he had in his bag for her.","而且霍利正满怀期待地等着他和他包里带给她的东西。"
"Not that there was any cupboard love in his little sweet—she was a bundle of affection.","这并不是说他的小甜心对他的爱是另有所图的——她心里满满的都是爱。"
"Then, with the rather bitter cynicism of the old, he wondered for a second whether it was not cupboard love which made Irene put up with him.","怀着老年人那种充满怨气的愤世嫉俗，他在一瞬间想到艾琳这样将就他是不是也另有所图。"
"No, she was not that sort either.","不，她也不是那样的人。"
"She had, if anything, too little notion of how to butter her bread, no sense of property, poor thing!","如果非说些什么，只能说她对自己的生活保障没有打算，也没什么财产观念，可怜的孩子！"
"Besides, he had not breathed a word about that codicil, nor should he—sufficient unto the day was the good thereof.","而且，对于遗嘱新加的那条他只字没提，也不该提——眼下这样就挺好的。"
"In the victoria which met him at the station Holly was restraining the dog Balthasar, and their caresses made ‘jubey’ his drive home.","霍利和小狗巴尔塔萨坐着大马车来车站接他，他们的嬉戏让他回家的旅程很开心。"
"All the rest of that fine hot day and most of the next he was content and peaceful, reposing in the shade, while the long lingering sunshine showered gold on the lawns and the flowers.","那晴朗炎热的一天剩下的时光，还有第二天的大部分时间里，他都心满意足，安静地在树阴下休息，长长的斜阳给花草镀上了一层金色。"
"But on Thursday evening at his lonely dinner he began to count the hours; sixty-five till he would go down to meet her again in the little coppice, and walk up through the fields at her side.","但到了周四晚上，当他独自一人吃晚餐时，就算起时间来了：还得再等六十五个小时，他才能再次到小灌木林中接她，陪着她穿过田野。"
"He had intended to consult the doctor about his fainting fit, but the fellow would be sure to insist on quiet, no excitement and all that; and he did not mean to be tied by the leg, did not want to be told of an infirmity—if there were one, could not afford to hear of it at his time of life, now that this new interest had come.","他本想向医生问问自己不时晕过去的事情，但医生一定会要求他保持平静，不要激动等等。他不想那样被人绊住手脚，不想听别人说自己虚弱——即便确实如此，他也不想在这个时候，他刚发现了这个新乐趣的时候听到。"
"And he carefully avoided making any mention of it in a letter to his son.","在写给儿子的信中，他小心翼翼，尽量避免提到自己的病情。"
"It would only bring them back with a run!","那样只会让他们匆匆忙忙赶回来！"
"How far this silence was due to consideration for their pleasure, how far to regard for his own, he did not pause to consider.","这样避开提起，有多少是为了孩子们的快乐，又有多少是为自己的快乐考虑，他没有功夫去细想。"
"That night in his study he had just finished his cigar and was dozing off, when he heard the rustle of a gown, and was conscious of a scent of violets.","那晚，他在书房刚抽完雪茄，正打着盹，突然听到有衣服的沙沙声，并且闻到了一股紫罗兰香。"
"Opening his eyes he saw her, dressed in grey, standing by the fireplace, holding out her arms.","他睁开眼睛，看到她身穿灰色裙子，正站在壁炉旁边，双臂往外伸着。"
"The odd thing was that, though those arms seemed to hold nothing, they were curved as if round someone’s neck, and her own neck was bent back, her lips open, her eyes closed.","奇怪的是，她双臂似乎并没抱着什么，却那样弯着，好像在搂着一个人的脖子，头向后仰着，嘴唇微启，眼睛闭着。"
"She vanished at once, and there were the mantelpiece and his bronzes.","突然，她消失得无影无踪，只有他的壁炉架和铜像还在那里。"
"But those bronzes and the mantelpiece had not been there when she was, only the fireplace and the wall!","但刚刚她在那里的时候，那些壁炉架和铜像并不在，只有壁炉和墙！"
"Shaken and troubled, he got up.","他战栗不安，摇摇晃晃地站起来。"
"‘I must take medicine,’ he thought; ‘I can’t be well.’","“我必须得吃药了，”他想，“我真的有点儿不对劲了。”"
"His heart beat too fast, he had an asthmatic feeling in the chest; and going to the window, he opened it to get some air.","他心跳得很快，胸口有患了哮喘的感觉；于是他过去打开窗户，想呼吸些新鲜空气。"
"A dog was barking far away, one of the dogs at Gage’s farm no doubt, beyond the coppice.","远处传来几声狗叫，那一定是远处小灌木林那边盖奇农场的狗。"
"A beautiful still night, but dark.","一个美好恬静的夜晚，只是一片漆黑。"
"‘I dropped off,’ he mused, ‘that’s it!","“我刚刚是睡着了，”他若有思索地说，“一定是！"
"And yet I’ll swear my eyes were open!’","但我发誓刚才我的眼睛是睁着的！”"
"A sound like a sigh seemed to answer.","他听到一声叹息，好像是在回答他。"
"“What’s that?” he said sharply, “who’s there?”","“谁？”他警觉地问，“谁在那儿？”"
"Putting his hand to his side to still the beating of his heart, he stepped out on the terrace.","他用手按着左肋以缓和心跳，走到了露台上。"
"Something soft scurried by in the dark.","有个毛茸茸的东西在黑暗中窜了过去。"
"“Shoo!” It was that great grey cat.","“嘘！”原来是那只大灰猫。"
"‘Young Bosinney was like a great cat!’ he thought.","“小波辛尼就像一只大猫！”他想，"
"‘It was him in there, that she—that she was—He’s got her still!’","“是他在那里，她——她才——他还缠着她！”"
"He walked to the edge of the terrace, and looked down into the darkness; he could just see the powdering of the daisies on the unmown lawn.","他走到露台边上，俯视着这一片黑暗，隐约可以看见未修剪的草坪上细细密密散落着的雏菊。"
"Here to-day and gone to-morrow!","今天花开，明天花谢！"
"And there came the moon, who saw all, young and old, alive and dead, and didn’t care a dump!","月亮升起来，俯视众生；青年和老人、生者和逝者，它都毫不在乎！"
"His own turn soon.","他的时限也快到了。"
"For a single day of youth he would give what was left!","如果能重获一日青春，他愿意倾其所有！"
"And he turned again towards the house.","他转过身看着房子。"
"He could see the windows of the night nursery up there.","可以看到上面孩子房间的窗子。"
"His little sweet would be asleep.","他的小甜心正在酣睡。"
"‘Hope that dog won’t wake her!’ he thought.","“希望狗别把她吵醒了！”他想，"
"‘What is it makes us love, and makes us die!","“是什么让我们去爱，又是什么让我们死去！"
"I must go to bed.’","我得去睡觉了。”"
"And across the terrace stones, growing grey in the moonlight, he passed back within.","露台的石铺地面在月光下更显灰白。他穿过去，回到了房子里。"
"How should an old man live his days if not in dreaming of his well-spent past?","除了梦回美好的过去，一个老人还能怎样继续他的生活？"
"In that, at all events, there is no agitating warmth, only pale winter sunshine.","无论如何，回忆中没有令人不安的燥热，只有冬日里苍白的阳光。"
"The shell can withstand the gentle beating of the dynamos of memory.","这副躯壳尚可承受住记忆那温柔的敲打。"
"The present he should distrust; the future shun.","他应该怀疑现在，逃避未来。"
"From beneath thick shade he should watch the sunlight creeping at his toes.","他应该在浓郁的树阴下面看阳光慢慢爬过脚背。"
"If there be sun of summer, let him not go out into it, mistaking it for the Indian-summer sun!","如果夏意浓浓，就不要让他跑去阳光下，别误把那当作“印第安之夏”的太阳！"
"Thus peradventure he shall decline softly, slowly, imperceptibly, until impatient Nature clutches his wind-pipe and he gasps away to death some early morning before the world is aired, and they put on his tombstone: ‘In the fulness of years!’ yea!","这样的话，他的身体或许会退化得轻一些、慢一些、不那么明显，直到大自然不耐烦了，掐住他的气管，使他在这个世界苏醒前的某个凌晨吐出最后一口气，离开人世。然后人们会在他的墓碑上写下“寿终正寝”。这多好啊！"
"If he preserve his principles in perfect order, a Forsyte may live on long after he is dead.","是的，一个福赛特如果一丝不苟地遵行他的原则，他在死后还可能长久地活下去。"
"Old Jolyon was conscious of all this, and yet there was in him that which transcended Forsyteism.","老乔利恩自然清楚这些，但他骨子里还有一种超越福赛特主义的东西。"
"For it is written that a Forsyte shall not love beauty more than reason; nor his own way more than his own health.","因为福赛特家有成文的家规：不能因爱美而失掉理性，不能因随心所欲而毁掉健康。"
"And something beat within him in these days that with each throb fretted at the thinning shell.","这些日子他总觉得有什么东西在他体内搏动，每一次悸动都啮蚀着他这副愈加瘦弱的躯壳。"
"His sagacity knew this, but it knew too that he could not stop that beating, nor would if he could.","他的理智觉察到了这一点，但同时也知道他无法停止这种悸动，而且就算能他也不会。"
"And yet, if you had told him he was living on his capital, he would have stared you down.","但是，如果你对他说他是吃老本，他一定会瞪着你，让你不敢与他对视。"
"No, no; a man did not live on his capital; it was not done!","不，不，人不能吃老本，那是不行的！"
"The shibboleths of the past are ever more real than the actualities of the present.","过去的陈规比当前的现实更加真实。"
"And he, to whom living on one’s capital had always been anathema, could not have borne to have applied so gross a phrase to his own case.","他一直对吃老本深恶痛绝，当然无法忍受用这一肮脏的说法来描述他自己的境况。"
"Pleasure is healthful; beauty good to see; to live again in the youth of the young—and what else on earth was he doing!","快乐益于健康；美赏心悦目；在年轻人的青春中重新活过——他所做的不就是这个么！"
"Methodically, as had been the way of his whole life, he now arranged his time.","他一生都有条不紊地生活，如今也井井有条地安排自己的时间。"
"On Tuesdays he journeyed up to town by train; Irene came and dined with him.","每个星期二，他坐火车进城，艾琳过来和他一起吃饭。"
"And they went to the opera.","然后他们一起去听歌剧。"
"On Thursdays he drove to town, and, putting that fat chap and his horses up, met her in Kensington Gardens, picking up the carriage after he had left her, and driving home again in time for dinner.","每个星期四，他坐马车进城，把那个胖家伙和他的马安顿好，到肯辛顿花园和她见面，两人分开后他再乘马车回家，刚好赶上吃晚饭。"
"He threw out the casual formula that he had business in London on those two days.","他随便找了个借口，说那两天在伦敦有事要办。 "
"On Wednesdays and Saturdays she came down to give Holly music lessons.","每个星期三和星期六，她来给霍利上音乐课。"
"The greater the pleasure he took in her society, the more scrupulously fastidious he became, just a matter-of-fact and friendly uncle.","在她的陪伴中获得的乐趣越多，他就越变得小心翼翼、谨小慎微，只作一个本分的、友善的伯父。"
"Not even in feeling, really, was he more—for, after all, there was his age.","即便在感情上，他也没有其他奢求——毕竟他年事已高。"
"And yet, if she were late he fidgeted himself to death.","但是如果她来迟了，他就会坐立不安，心急如焚。"
"If she missed coming, which happened twice, his eyes grew sad as an old dog’s, and he failed to sleep.","如果她没有来——这发生过两次——他的眼神就会变得如垂暮的老狗般悲伤，晚上也睡不着。"
"And so a month went by—a month of summer in the fields, and in his heart, with summer’s heat and the fatigue thereof.","这样过去了一个月——一个月的田野中的夏天，也是他心里的夏天，当然还有夏天的燥热和疲惫。"
"Who could have believed a few weeks back that he would have looked forward to his son’s and his grand-daughter’s return with something like dread!","谁能相信，就在几周前，他还正近乎忧虑地热切期盼着他的儿子和孙女回家！"
"There was such a delicious freedom, such recovery of that independence a man enjoys before he founds a family, about these weeks of lovely weather, and this new companionship with one who demanded nothing, and remained always a little unknown, retaining the fascination of mystery.","他几周来享受着宜人的天气，身边还多了一个毫无所求的人陪伴，她身上总有让人捉摸不到的东西，也越发保持着神秘的魅力。这一切都让他体会到自由的喜悦，重享成家立业前那种自在的感觉。"
"It was like a draught of wine to him who has been drinking water for so long that he has almost forgotten the stir wine brings to his blood, the narcotic to his brain.","这就像一个长期喝白开水的人在几乎忘掉美酒带来的血脉贲张、大脑迷醉的感觉后，又能畅饮美酒时的感受。"
"The flowers were coloured brighter, scents and music and the sunlight had a living value—were no longer mere reminders of past enjoyment.","花朵的颜色更鲜艳了，花香、音乐和阳光都有了活生生的价值——而不再只是让人想起过去的美好时光。"
"There was something now to live for which stirred him continually to anticipation.","现在他活着有了新的目标，这个目标也不断让他有新的期待。"
"He lived in that, not in retrospection; the difference is considerable to any so old as he.","他生活在这种期待里，而不是在回忆中；对于像他这个年纪的人来说，这两者间的差别很大。"
"The pleasures of the table, never of much consequence to one naturally abstemious, had lost all value.","他原本就饮食有度，美酒佳肴对他无关紧要，如今更是对他一点儿吸引力也没有了。"
"He ate little, without knowing what he ate; and every day grew thinner and more worn to look at.","他吃得很少，且食不甘味，因而一天天消瘦下去，看起来也越发憔悴不堪。"
"He was again a ‘threadpaper’; and to this thinned form his massive forehead, with hollows at the temples, gave more dignity than ever.","他又成了“瘦竹竿”，由于身体消瘦，他的额头更显宽大，加上凹陷的太阳穴，较之以往更显出他的威严来。"
"He was very well aware that he ought to see the doctor, but liberty was too sweet.","他非常清楚自己应该看医生，但自由实在是太过美好。"
"He could not afford to pet his frequent shortness of breath and the pain in his side at the expense of liberty.","不过是常常气短、肋下疼痛，他无法忍受为了减轻这些而丧失自由。"
"Return to the vegetable existence he had led among the agricultural journals with the life-size mangold wurzels, before this new attraction came into his life—no!","回到这个新乐趣闯进他生活之前的状态，再去过那种植物般乏味的生活，翻看农业杂志里跟实物一样大小的甜菜相片——不！"
"He exceeded his allowance of cigars.","他抽的雪茄已经超出了限额。"
"Two a day had always been his rule.","他一直都每天只抽两支。"
"Now he smoked three and sometimes four—a man will when he is filled with the creative spirit.","而现在他每天抽三支，有时甚至四支——当一个人创造力旺盛的时候往往如此。"
"But very often he thought: ‘I must give up smoking, and coffee; I must give up rattling up to town.’","但他也经常想：“我必须戒烟，戒咖啡，也不能老往城里去了。”"
"But he did not; there was no one in any sort of authority to notice him, and this was a priceless boon.","但是他没有；没人有权力来监督他，这真是个无价的恩赐。"
"The servants perhaps wondered, but they were, naturally, dumb.","仆人们也许很好奇，但他们天生就会保持缄默。"
"Mam’zelle Beauce was too concerned with her own digestion, and too ‘wellbrrred’ to make personal allusions.","博塞小姐一心想着自己的消化问题，而且太“有教养”，绝不会触及他人的私事。"
"Holly had not as yet an eye for the relative appearance of him who was her plaything and her god.","霍利还小，看不出他外表的变化，只把他当作她的玩偶、她的神。"
"It was left for Irene herself to beg him to eat more, to rest in the hot part of the day, to take a tonic, and so forth.","这样就只有艾琳自己来劝他多吃东西，天热的时候多休息，吃些补药什么的了。"
"But she did not tell him that she was the cause of his thinness—for one cannot see the havoc oneself is working.","但她没有说他这么消瘦就是因为她——人总是看不到自己造成的破坏。"
"A man of eighty-five has no passions, but the Beauty which produces passion works on in the old way, till death closes the eyes which crave the sight of Her.","八十五岁的人本说不上热情，但是美能唤起热情，一向如此，且始终如此，直到死亡将那双渴望见到她的眼睛闭上。"
"On the first day of the second week in July he received a letter from his son in Paris to say that they would all be back on Friday.","七月第二个星期的第一天，他收到了儿子从巴黎寄来的信，说他们星期五就全都回来。"
"This had always been more sure than Fate; but, with the pathetic improvidence given to the old, that they may endure to the end, he had never quite admitted it.","这一直是比命运还要确定的事；但是，由于老年人往往不顾将来，只是可怜地以为他们可以撑到最后，他始终不肯明确承认这件事。"
"Now he did, and something would have to be done.","现在他承认了，他必须做些什么了。"
"He had ceased to be able to imagine life without this new interest, but that which is not imagined sometimes exists, as Forsytes are perpetually finding to their cost.","他已经不能想象失去这种新乐趣的生活，但是想象不到的事情有时是存在的，福赛特家族的人就一直不断为此付出代价。"
"He sat in his old leather chair, doubling up the letter, and mumbling with his lips the end of an unlighted cigar.","他坐在他的旧皮椅上，折起信纸，唇间嚅弄着一根没有点燃的雪茄。"
"After to-morrow his Tuesday expeditions to town would have to be abandoned.","明天之后，他就没法每星期二进城一次了。"
"He could still drive up, perhaps, once a week, on the pretext of seeing his man of business.","他也许还能每星期坐马车进城一次，借口去见他的代理人。"
"But even that would be dependent on his health, for now they would begin to fuss about him.","可即便这样也得看他的健康状况，因为现在他们要开始担忧他的身体了。"
"The lessons!","钢琴课！"
"The lessons must go on!","钢琴课必须得上下去！"
"She must swallow down her scruples, and June must put her feelings in her pocket.","艾琳必须放下她的顾虑，琼也必须收起她的感情。"
"She had done so once, on the day after the news of Bosinney’s death; what she had done then, she could surely do again now.","她以前收起过她的感情，就是知道波辛尼出事的那天；她那次能做到的，这次当然也能做到。"
"Four years since that injury was inflicted on her—not Christian to keep the memory of old sores alive.","那一次伤害的打击已经过去四年了——还对过去的痛苦念念不忘就太不人道了。"
"June’s will was strong, but his was stronger, for his sands were running out.","琼的意志很强，但他的意志更强，因为他剩下的日子不多了。"
"Irene was soft, surely she would do this for him, subdue her natural shrinking, sooner than give him pain!","艾琳很温和，当然会为他这么做，她会克制她天性中的怯懦，而不愿让他痛苦！"
"The lessons must continue; for if they did, he was secure.","钢琴课必须继续下去，因为只有这样，他才安妥。"
"And lighting his cigar at last, he began trying to shape out how to put it to them all, and explain this strange intimacy; how to veil and wrap it away from the naked truth—that he could not bear to be deprived of the sight of beauty.","最后，他点燃了雪茄，开始考虑该怎么跟他们说，怎么解释这奇怪的亲密之情；怎样给它包装，以掩盖赤裸裸的实情——他受不了无法欣赏到美。"
"Ah! Holly! Holly was fond of her, Holly liked her lessons.","啊！霍利！霍利喜欢她，霍利喜欢她的钢琴课。"
"She would save him—his little sweet!","她会救他的——他的小甜心！"
"And with that happy thought he became serene, and wondered what he had been worrying about so fearfully.","这个念头使他愉悦了，也平静了下来，并且奇怪自己刚才为何那样忧心。"
"He must not worry, it left him always curiously weak, and as if but half present in his own body.","他不应该担心，担心总是让他感到莫名的虚弱，好像躯壳中只剩下了半个灵魂似的。"
"That evening after dinner he had a return of the dizziness, though he did not faint.","那天晚饭后，他头晕的毛病又犯了，但他没有晕倒。"
"He would not ring the bell, because he knew it would mean a fuss, and make his going up on the morrow more conspicuous.","他不愿按铃叫人，因为他知道这将引起一阵忙乱，明天进城的事就更显眼了。"
"When one grew old, the whole world was in conspiracy to limit freedom, and for what reason?—just to keep the breath in him a little longer.","当人老了，整个世界都在合谋限制他的自由，为的是什么？——只是为了让他多活几口气。"
"He did not want it at such cost.","他不想只为多活一会儿而付出这样的代价。"
"Only the dog Balthasar saw his lonely recovery from that weakness; anxiously watched his master go to the sideboard and drink some brandy, instead of giving him a biscuit.","只有小狗巴尔萨泽看着他一个人从那阵虚弱中恢复了过来，焦急地望着它的主人走到餐具柜旁边，倒了一些白兰地喝，而没有扔给它一块饼干吃。"
"When at last old Jolyon felt able to tackle the stairs he went up to bed.","最后老乔利恩感觉能够自己上台阶时，他就上楼睡觉去了。"
"And, though still shaky next morning, the thought of the evening sustained and strengthened him.","尽管第二天早上他仍觉得有些发抖，但对晚上的期待支持着他，给了他力气。"
"It was always such a pleasure to give her a good dinner—he suspected her of undereating when she was alone; and, at the opera to watch her eyes glow and brighten, the unconscious smiling of her lips.","请她享用一顿丰盛的晚餐总是令他愉快——他猜测她一个人的时候可能吃得不好；在歌剧院里望着她那明亮又溢满光彩的眼睛以及唇边那不经意间流露的微笑，也真让人开心。"
"She hadn’t much pleasure, and this was the last time he would be able to give her that treat.","她的生活中少有乐趣，而这是他最后一次款待她的机会了。"
"But when he was packing his bag he caught himself wishing that he had not the fatigue of dressing for dinner before him, and the exertion, too, of telling her about June’s return.","但收拾行李的时候，他想到晚餐前得换衣服，真麻烦；还得告诉她琼要回来了，也是件费劲的事，要是没有这些事该有多好。"
"The opera that evening was ‘Carmen,’ and he chose the last entr’acte to break the news, instinctively putting it off till the latest moment.","那晚的剧目是《卡门》，他在最后一次幕间休息时才把那消息告诉她，不自觉地把消息拖到了最后一刻。"
"She took it quietly, queerly; in fact, he did not know how she had taken it before the wayward music lifted up again and silence became necessary.","她平静地接受了这个消息，这有点儿蹊跷；实际上，他还没来得及了解她的想法，那恼人的音乐就再次响了起来，大家就都不能说话了。"
"The mask was down over her face, that mask behind which so much went on that he could not see.","她的脸又像是戴上了面具，面具后面的种种情绪起伏，他都看不到。"
"She wanted time to think it over, no doubt!","无疑她需要时间好好想一想！"
"He would not press her, for she would be coming to give her lesson to-morrow afternoon, and he should see her then when she had got used to the idea.","他也不会催她，因为她明天下午还会来教钢琴课，那时她就应该考虑过这件事了，到时候看吧。"
"In the cab he talked only of the Carmen; he had seen better in the old days, but this one was not bad at all.","在马车里，他只谈论着《卡门》，他从前看过更好的，但这次的也很不错。"
"When he took her hand to say good-night, she bent quickly forward and kissed his forehead.","当他握着她的手道晚安时，她飞快地向前俯身，亲吻了他的前额。"
"“Good-bye, dear Uncle Jolyon, you have been so sweet to me.”","“再见，亲爱的乔利恩伯伯，您待我太好了。”"
"“To-morrow then,” he said.","“好，明天见。”他说，"
"“Good-night.","“晚安。"
"Sleep well.”","睡个好觉。”"
"She echoed softly: “Sleep well” and from the cab window, already moving away, he saw her face screwed round towards him, and her hand put out in a gesture which seemed to linger.","她柔声重复着：“睡个好觉。”马车开始走了，他看见车窗里她扭头望着自己，一只手伸出窗外，像是依依不舍的样子。"
"He sought his room slowly.","他慢慢地走回自己的房间。"
"They never gave him the same, and he could not get used to these ‘spick-and-spandy’ bedrooms with new furniture and grey-green carpets sprinkled all over with pink roses.","他们从来不让他住同一间房，他很不习惯这些一尘不染的房间，家具都是新的，灰绿色的地毯上到处印着粉红色的玫瑰花。"
"He was wakeful and that wretched Habanera kept throbbing in his head.","他睡不着，那支可恶的哈巴涅拉舞曲一直在他脑海中回荡着。"
"His French had never been equal to its words, but its sense he knew, if it had any sense, a gipsy thing—wild and unaccountable.","他一直不太懂法文，不过他知道这个名字的意思，如果它有什么意思的话，那是指一个吉卜赛女郎——狂野而神秘。"
"Well, there was in life something which upset all your care and plans—something which made men and women dance to its pipes.","的确，生命中确实有种东西能打翻你所有的顾虑和打算——让男男女女都随着它的管乐跳起舞来。"
"And he lay staring from deep-sunk eyes into the darkness where the unaccountable held sway.","他躺着，一双深陷的眼睛盯着黑暗，那里被神秘的力量统占着。"
"You thought you had hold of life, but it slipped away behind you, took you by the scruff of the neck, forced you here and forced you there, and then, likely as not, squeezed life out of you!","你以为你掌控了人生，它却溜到你身后，抓住你的颈背，逼你去这里去那里，然后还说不定会要了你的命！"
"It took the very stars like that, he shouldn’t wonder, rubbed their noses together and flung them apart; it had never done playing its pranks.","他想，就连星星它也不会放过，把它们攒在一起，再猛地撒开；它有着变不完的戏法。"
"Five million people in this great blunderbuss of a town, and all of them at the mercy of that Life-Force, like a lot of little dried peas hopping about on a board when you struck your fist on it.","五百万人挤在这个大锅似的城市里，都任凭这一生命力的摆布，就像平板上的无数个小干豆，随着拳头撞击平板而上下跳动。"
"Ah, well! Himself would not hop much longer—a good long sleep would do him good!","唉！他也跳不了多久了——好好睡个长觉也好！"
"How hot it was up here!—how noisy!","这城里也太热了！——太吵了！"
"His forehead burned; she had kissed it just where he always worried; just there—as if she had known the very place and wanted to kiss it all away for him.","他的额头发烫，她刚好吻到了他一直感到不舒服的地方，就是那里——仿佛她知道就是那里，想替他把不适都吻掉。"
"But, instead, her lips left a patch of grievous uneasiness.","然而，她的双唇留下的却是一阵强烈的不安。"
"She had never spoken in quite that voice, had never before made that lingering gesture or looked back at him as she drove away.","她从未用那种语气说过话，从未有过那种恋恋不舍的手势，也从未在乘车离去时回头看他。"
"He got out of bed and pulled the curtains aside; his room faced down over the river.","他从床上起来，拉开窗帘，从他的房间可以俯瞰河水。"
"There was little air, but the sight of that breadth of water flowing by, calm, eternal, soothed him.","空气很沉闷，可看着那一大片河水平静地、无休止地流过，他的心情渐渐平复下来。"
"‘The great thing,’ he thought ‘is not to make myself a nuisance.","“最重要的，”他想，“是别让自己变得讨人嫌。"
"I’ll think of my little sweet, and go to sleep.’","我还是想想我的小甜心，睡觉去吧。”"
"But it was long before the heat and throbbing of the London night died out into the short slumber of the summer morning.","伦敦的夏夜，热气和嘈杂很久不散，直到清晨才消停片刻。"
"And old Jolyon had but forty winks.","老乔利恩只打了一个盹。"
"When he reached home next day he went out to the flower garden, and with the help of Holly, who was very delicate with flowers, gathered a great bunch of carnations.","第二天回家后，他去了花园。霍利很懂得花的好坏，在她的帮助下，他采了一大束康乃馨。"
"They were, he told her, for ‘the lady in grey’—a name still bandied between them; and he put them in a bowl in his study where he meant to tackle Irene the moment she came, on the subject of June and future lessons.","他告诉霍利，这些花是为那位“灰衣服女士”准备的——他们之间还用着这个称呼。他把花放在书房的大瓶里，想着艾琳一来，就在那里和她好好谈谈琼的事，说服她继续给霍利上课。"
"Their fragrance and colour would help.","这些花的香味和颜色会有所帮助。"
"After lunch he lay down, for he felt very tired, and the carriage would not bring her from the station till four o’clock.","午饭后他觉得很累，就躺下了，马车四点才能把她从车站接来。"
"But as the hour approached he grew restless, and sought the schoolroom, which overlooked the drive.","不过，随着四点钟临近，他变得不安起来，于是走进那间可以俯视车道的教室。"
"The sun-blinds were down, and Holly was there with Mademoiselle Beauce, sheltered from the heat of a stifling July day, attending to their silkworms.","教室的百叶帘放了下来，以挡住七月里沉闷的热气，霍利和博斯小姐都在那里，照料着她们的蚕。"
"Old Jolyon had a natural antipathy to these methodical creatures, whose heads and colour reminded him of elephants; who nibbled such quantities of holes in nice green leaves; and smelled, as he thought, horrid.","老乔利恩天生不喜欢这些慢条斯理的家伙，它们的头和颜色让他想起大象；它们在漂亮的绿叶子上咬出无数个洞；而且他觉得它们的气味非常糟糕。"
"He sat down on a chintz-covered windowseat whence he could see the drive, and get what air there was; and the dog Balthasar who appreciated chintz on hot days, jumped up beside him.","他在窗下罩着印花棉布的椅子上坐下，在那丽丽他能看到车道，还能呼吸点儿新鲜空气；小狗巴尔塔萨也跳上来呆在他旁边，因为它喜欢热天时在印花棉布上呆着。"
"Over the cottage piano a violet dust-sheet, faded almost to grey, was spread, and on it the first lavender, whose scent filled the room.","竖式小钢琴上盖着块淡紫色的防尘毯，颜色几乎退成灰色了。毯子上摆着早开的熏衣草，香气弥漫整个房间。"
"In spite of the coolness here, perhaps because of that coolness the beat of life vehemently impressed his ebbed-down senses.","尽管这里比较清凉，可能正是因为这种清凉，生命的悸动强烈地冲击着他已退化的感官。"
"Each sunbeam which came through the chinks had annoying brilliance; that dog smelled very strong; the lavender perfume was overpowering; those silkworms heaving up their grey-green backs seemed horribly alive; and Holly’s dark head bent over them had a wonderfully silky sheen.","通过窗缝透进的每一缕阳光都耀眼得让人恼火；小狗身上的气味很重；熏衣草的香味过于浓烈；那些弓起灰绿色后背的蚕看起来活跃得吓人；霍利低头看着蚕，深色的头发如同丝绸般光亮。"
"A marvellous cruelly strong thing was life when you were old and weak; it seemed to mock you with its multitude of forms and its beating vitality.","你年老体弱时，生命就变成了残酷的东西，美妙并强大，似乎在以其多变的形式和激荡的活力取笑你。"
"He had never, till those last few weeks, had this curious feeling of being with one half of him eagerly borne along in the stream of life, and with the other half left on the bank, watching that helpless progress.","最近几周，他突然有种之前从未有过的奇怪感觉，觉得自己的一半在随着生命之河流走，另一半却在岸上，注视着这个无助的进展。"
"Only when Irene was with him did he lose this double consciousness.","只有艾琳在他身边时，这种双重意识才会消失。"
"Holly turned her head, pointed with her little brown fist to the piano—for to point with a finger was not ‘well-brrred’—and said slyly:","霍利回过头，用她棕色的小拳头指着钢琴——因为用一个手指指东西是没有“教养”的——俏皮地说："
"“Look at the ‘lady in grey,’ Gran; isn’t she pretty to-day?”","“爷爷，快看‘灰衣女士’。她今天漂亮吧？”"
"Old Jolyon’s heart gave a flutter, and for a second the room was clouded; then it cleared, and he said with a twinkle:","老乔利恩心头一震，房间瞬间变得模糊，随后又清楚了，他眨了下眼睛，问道："
"“Who’s been dressing her up?”","“谁给她穿的衣服？”"
"“Mam’zelle.”","“博斯小姐。”"
"“Hollee! Don’t be foolish!”","“霍利！别闹了！”"
"That prim little Frenchwoman!","这个一本正经的法国小女人！"
"She hadn’t yet got over the music lessons being taken away from her.","她还对不让她教音乐课这事耿耿于怀。"
"That wouldn’t help.","这没用。"
"His little sweet was the only friend they had.","他的小甜心是他们唯一的朋友。"
"Well, they were her lessons.","而音乐课应由她来教。"
"And he shouldn’t budge shouldn’t budge for anything.","他不应该让步，不该为任何事让步。"
"He stroked the warm wool on Balthasar’s head, and heard Holly say: “When mother’s home, there won’t be any changes, will there?","他轻抚着巴尔塔萨头上暖呼呼的毛，听到霍利说：“妈妈回家后，就什么也不会变了，是不是？"
"She doesn’t like strangers, you know.”","您知道的，她不喜欢生人。”"
"The child’s words seemed to bring the chilly atmosphere of opposition about old Jolyon, and disclose all the menace to his new-found freedom.","孩子的话似乎让老乔利恩陷入了充满反对的冰冷氛围中，释放了所有威胁他新发现的自由的因素。"
"Ah!","啊！"
"He would have to resign himself to being an old man at the mercy of care and love, or fight to keep this new and prized companionship; and to fight tired him to death.","他要么甘心做一个靠家人关爱过活的老头，要么就得为维护这一新的珍贵友谊而抗争，而后者会把他累死。"
"But his thin, worn face hardened into resolution till it appeared all Jaw.","但是他瘦削年迈的脸上渐渐露出坚定的表情，直到整张脸上都是那种神情。"
"This was his house, and his affair; he should not budge!","这是他的家，他的事，他绝不让步！"
"He looked at his watch, old and thin like himself; he had owned it fifty years.","他看看表，这表像他一样又老又单薄，他已经戴了50年了。"
"Past four already!","已经过了四点了！"
"And kissing the top of Holly’s head in passing, he went down to the hall.","他下楼去了大厅，经过霍利身边时亲了下她的头。"
"He wanted to get hold of her before she went up to give her lesson.","他想在她上楼教课前就见到她。"
"At the first sound of wheels he stepped out into the porch, and saw at once that the victoria was empty.","一听见车轮声他就出去到了门廊，只看到那大马车里没人。"
"“The train’s in, sir; but the lady ’asn’t come.”","“先生，火车到了，可那位太太没来。”"
"Old Jolyon gave him a sharp upward look, his eyes seemed to push away that fat chap’s curiosity, and defy him to see the bitter disappointment he was feeling.","老乔利恩用锐利的目光抬头看了看他，那眼神似乎要推开那胖家伙的好奇心，不让他看出自己此刻深深的失望之情。"
"“Very well,” he said, and turned back into the house.","“好。”他说道，转身进了屋。"
"He went to his study and sat down, quivering like a leaf.","他走进书房坐下，身子像树叶一样颤抖。"
"What did this mean?","这意味着什么？"
"She might have lost her train, but he knew well enough she hadn’t.","她可能没赶上火车，但他很清楚不是这样。"
"‘Good-bye, dear Uncle Jolyon.’","“再见，亲爱的乔利恩伯伯。”"
"Why ‘Good-bye’ and not ‘Good-night’?","为什么是“再见”而不是“晚安”？"
"And that hand of hers lingering in the air.","还有她那只依依不舍伸出的手。"
"And her kiss.","还有她的吻。"
"What did it mean?","这都意味着什么？"
"Vehement alarm and irritation took possession of him.","强烈的惊慌和恼怒席卷了他全身。"
"He got up and began to pace the Turkey carpet, between window and wall.","他起身，踏着土耳其地毯，在窗户和墙之间踱来踱去。"
"She was going to give him up!","她要离他而去了！"
"He felt it for certain—and he defenceless.","他知道这事确凿无疑——却又无能为力。"
"An old man wanting to look on beauty!","一个老人想要欣赏美！"
"It was ridiculous!","这简直是笑话！"
"Age closed his mouth, paralysed his power to fight.","年纪捂住了他的嘴，抽走了他抗争的力气。"
"He had no right to what was warm and living, no right to anything but memories and sorrow.","他已无权拥有温暖而有生气的事物，能拥有的只有回忆和痛苦。"
"He could not plead with her; even an old man has his dignity.","他不能乞求她，即便老人也有自己的尊严。"
"Defenceless!","无能为力！"
"For an hour, lost to bodily fatigue, he paced up and down, past the bowl of carnations he had plucked, which mocked him with its scent.","他忘却了身体的疲劳，一个小时都在来回踱步，不时经过那瓶之前摘的康乃馨，那花香仿佛是在嘲笑他。"
"Of all things hard to bear, the prostration of will-power is hardest, for one who has always had his way.","世上难以承受之事虽多，可对于习惯了随心所欲的人来说，意志被挫败是最难承受的。"
"Nature had got him in its net, and like an unhappy fish he turned and swam at the meshes, here and there, found no hole, no breaking point.","上天把他困在了网里，他像一条忧伤的鱼，在网中来回游动，这里碰碰，那里撞撞，却找不到一个漏洞、一处缺口。"
"They brought him tea at five o’clock, and a letter.","五点钟时他们给他送来了茶，还有一封信。"
"For a moment hope beat up in him.","他的内心顿时涌起一线希望。"
"He cut the envelope with the butter knife, and read:","他用涂黄油的餐刀将信封打开，读了起来："
"“DEAREST UNCLE JOLYON,—I can’t bear to write anything that may disappoint you, but I was too cowardly to tell you last night.","“亲爱的乔利恩伯伯：我其实不忍心写任何让您失望的东西，但我昨晚实在没勇气当面跟您说。"
"I feel I can’t come down and give Holly any more lessons, now that June is coming back.","琼就要回来了，我觉得我以后不能再去给霍利上课了。"
"Some things go too deep to be forgotten.","有些事情对人的伤害太深，不可能忘记。"
"It has been such a joy to see you and Holly.","我很高兴见到您和霍利。"
"Perhaps I shall still see you sometimes when you come up, though I’m sure it’s not good for you; I can see you are tiring yourself too much.","以后您进城的话我们或许可以再见面，但我觉得这对您身体不好，看得出来您最近太劳累了。"
"I believe you ought to rest quite quietly all this hot weather, and now you have your son and June coming back you will be so happy.","天气这么热，我想您应该好好静养。现在您的儿子和琼要回来了，您一定会过得很高兴。"
"Thank you a million times for all your sweetness to me.","非常感谢您一直以来对我的关爱。"
"“Lovingly your IRENE.”","爱您的艾琳。”"
"So, there it was!","看，就是这样！"
"Not good for him to have pleasure and what he chiefly cared about; to try and put off feeling the inevitable end of all things, the approach of death with its stealthy, rustling footsteps.","享受快乐对他不好，拥有自己所真正看重的东西对他不好；试图推迟一切都必将结束的感觉，不愿听到死亡正悄悄向他靠近的沙沙脚步声，也对他不好。"
"Not good for him!","对他不好！"
"Not even she could see how she was his new lease of interest in life, the incarnation of all the beauty he felt slipping from him.","甚至连她都看不出，正是她让他对生活重新有了热情，她是所有正从他身边溜走的美的化身。"
"His tea grew cold, his cigar remained unlit; and up and down he paced, torn between his dignity and his hold on life.","他的茶凉了，雪茄也没点，他来来回回地踱着步，在尊严和对生活的掌控间左右为难。"
"Intolerable to be squeezed out slowly, without a say of your own, to live on when your will was in the hands of others bent on weighing you to the ground with care and love.","实在不能容忍自己被慢慢排挤，却连句话都不能说，别人非得用关爱把你压得喘不过气，连意志都受他们摆布，还要这样活下去。"
"Intolerable!","不能容忍！"
"He would see what telling her the truth would do—the truth that he wanted the sight of her more than just a lingering on.","他想知道告诉她实情会怎样——实情是他想看到她，而不是多活几口气。"
"He sat down at his old bureau and took a pen.","他坐在旧书桌前，拿起笔。"
"But he could not write.","但他无法下笔。"

"But old men learn to forego their whims; they are obliged to, even the whim to live must be foregone sooner or later; and perhaps the sooner the better.","但老人得学会放弃一时的突发奇想，他们必须这样，连继续活下去的幻想也早晚都得放弃，或许越早越好。"

"‘Bitter,’ he thought, ‘but I can’t help it.","“怨气太重，”他想，“但也没办法，"

"A night-light was burning, and he could just see Holly’s face, with one hand underneath the cheek.","夜灯还亮着，他刚好能看清霍利的脸，她把一只手压在脸颊下。"

"‘Lady in grey!’","“灰衣女士！”"
"And a very odd thought beset him: Did she exist?","他突然有了个奇怪的念头：她存在过吗？"
"Had she ever come at all?","她真的来过吗？"
"Or was she but the emanation of all the beauty he had loved and must leave so soon?","或者她只是所有他曾爱过的而如今马上要离开的美的化身？"
"The violet-grey spirit with the dark eyes and the crown of amber hair, who walks the dawn and the moonlight, and at blue-bell time?","她是不是那个有着黑色眼睛和琥珀色头发的精灵，穿着紫罗兰灰色的衣服，在黎明时，在月光下，在风信子开放的时节走过原野？"
"What was she, who was she, did she exist?","她是什么？她是谁？她存在过吗？"
"He rose and stood a moment clutching the window-sill, to give him a sense of reality again; then began tiptoeing towards the door.","他起身站了一会儿，手抓着窗台，以便让自己重新找到现实的感觉。然后他蹑手蹑脚地走向房门。"

"After sounding him, the fellow pulled a face as long as your arm, and ordered him to stay in bed and give up smoking.","诊断过后，医生拉长了脸，要求他躺在床上休息并戒烟。"
"That was no hardship; there was nothing to get up for, and when he felt ill, tobacco always lost its savour.","这没什么难的，他即使起床也没什么事做，而且他得病时，香烟也索然无味。"

"He had everything in life he wanted—except a little more breath, and less weight—just here!","生活中他想要的一切都有了——除了还想多一些气力，少一些沉重——都在这里了！"
"He would see her when she emerged from the fernery, come swaying just a little, a violet-grey figure passing over the daisies and dandelions and ‘soldiers’ on the lawn—the soldiers with their flowery crowns.","他会看着她从树丛中走来，身着紫罗兰灰色的衣服，轻微摆动着身体，走过雏菊、蒲公英和草地上的“士兵”——这些戴着花冠的小小士兵。"
"He would not move, but she would come up to him and say: ‘Dear Uncle Jolyon, I am sorry!’ and sit in the swing and let him look at her and tell her that he had not been very well but was all right now; and that dog would lick her hand.","他不会动，但她会走过来对他说：“乔利恩伯伯，对不起！”然后坐在秋千上，让他看着她，告诉她自己最近身体不太好，不过现在没事了。那狗会去舔她的手。"
"That dog knew his master was fond of her; that dog was a good dog.","那狗知道它的主人喜欢她，它是只好狗。"
"It was quite shady under the tree; the sun could not get at him, only make the rest of the world bright so that he could see the Grand Stand at Epsom away out there, very far, and the cows cropping the clover in the field and swishing at the flies with their tails.","树下十分阴凉。太阳照不到他，只把周围照亮，这样他可以远远地看到埃普索姆那边的大看台，看到田里一边啃食三叶草、一边用尾巴驱赶苍蝇的奶牛。"
"He smelled the scent of limes, and lavender.","他闻到了酸橙和熏衣草的味道。"
"Ah! that was why there was such a racket of bees.","哈！怪不得有这么多蜜蜂嗡嗡叫呢。"

"Drowsy, too, drowsy and drugged on honey and happiness; as his heart was drugged and drowsy.","它们还很沉醉，为花蜜和快乐而沉醉，像吃了迷药；而他的心也是迷醉的。"

"And settling back in his chair he closed his eyes.","他躺回椅子上，合上了眼。"
"Some thistle-down came on what little air there was, and pitched on his moustache more white than itself.","一根蓟茸乘着仅有的一点风飘到了他的胡须上，胡须比那蓟茸还要白。"

"And suddenly he uttered a long, long howl.","忽然，他发出了一声长长的嗥叫。"
"But the thistledown was still as death, and the face of his old master.","但那根蓟茸还是一动不动，像小狗那老主人的脸一样，死一样的沉寂。"
"Summer—summer—summer!","夏天——夏天——夏天！"
"The soundless footsteps on the grass!","草地上那无声的脚步啊！"
