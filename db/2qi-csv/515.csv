"This Flower ","花朵"
"by Katherine Mansfield","作者：凯瑟琳·曼斯菲尔德"
"“But I tell you, my lord fool, out of this nettle danger, we pluck this flower, safety.”","“可是我告诉你吧，我的傻瓜老爷子，我们要安全地从危险的荆棘里采下花朵。”"
"As she lay there, looking up at the ceiling, she had her moment—yes, she had her moment!","她躺在那里，眼睛望着天花板，这一刻是属于她的了——是的，这一会儿时间是属于她的！"
"And it was not connected with anything she had thought or felt before, not even with those words the doctor had scarcely ceased speaking.","这一刻，跟她以前的所想所感一点儿关系也没有，甚至和医生刚刚说过的话一点儿关系也没有。"
"It was single, glowing, perfect; it was like—a pearl, too flawless to match with another...Could she describe what happened?","这一刻是独一无二的，是闪闪发光的，是完美的，它就像——一颗珍珠，一颗完美无瑕的珍珠，没有其他任何珠子可以与之相配……她能不能把刚才发生的事说一遍呢？"
"Impossible.","她做不到。"
"It was as though, even if she had not been conscious (and she certainly had not been conscious all the time) that she was fighting against the stream of life—the stream of life indeed!—she had suddenly ceased to struggle.","即使她没有意识到（其实她一直都没有意识到），她好像正在跟生命的激流作斗争——的确是生命的激流！——突然她停止斗争了。"
"Oh, more than that!","噢，还不止这样！"
"She had yielded, yielded absolutely, down to every minutest pulse and nerve, and she had fallen into the bright bosom of the stream and it had borne her...","她屈服了，完完全全屈服了，连她那最细微的脉搏、最纤弱的神经都屈服了，现在她沉溺在激流的明亮的怀抱里，任由激流将她带走……"
"She was part of her room—part of the great bouquet of southern anemones, of the white net curtains that blew in stiff against the light breeze, of the mirrors, the white silky rugs; she was part of the high, shaking, quivering clamour, broken with little bells and crying voices that went streaming by outside,—part of the leaves and the light.","她是她房间的一部分——是那一大束南方银莲花的一部分，是被微风吹起的白色网眼窗帘的一部分，是那镜子、那白色丝绒般的毛毯的一部分，是那一片高昂的、震撼的、颤抖的喧嚣声的一部分，只有外面流过的轻轻的铃声和喊叫声才打破了这喧闹声——她是那树叶和光线的一部分。"
"Over.","结束了。"
"She sat up.","她坐起来了。"
"The doctor had reappeared.","医生又出现了。"
"This strange little figure with his stethoscope still strung round his neck—for she had asked him to examine her heart—squeezing and kneading his freshly washed hands, had told her...","这个奇怪的小个子，脖子上还挂着个听诊器——因为她要求他给自己检查一下心脏——他不停地搓着揉着他那双洗干净的手，他曾经跟她说……"
"It was the first time she had ever seen him.","那还是她第一次见到他。"
"Roy, unable, of course, to miss the smallest dramatic opportunity, had obtained his rather shady Bloomsbury address from the man in whom he always confided everything, who, although he’d never met her, knew “all about them.”","罗伊，当然了，是不会错过最小的一次富于戏剧性意味的机会的；他从他那个无话不谈的好朋友那里获得了医生在绿树成阴的布卢姆斯伯里街的地址；尽管那位朋友从来没有见过她，但是“他们的那些事”，他全都知道。"
"“My darling,” Roy had said, “we’d better have an absolutely unknown man just in case it’s—well, what we don’t either of us want it to be.","“亲爱的，”罗伊说，“我们最好找一个完全不认识的人，为了以防万一——如果，碰到了我们都不希望遇到的那种情况呢。"
"One can’t be too careful in affairs of this sort.","碰到这种事，小心一点儿总是不会错的。"
"Doctors do talk.","医生的嘴是靠不住的。"
"It’s all damned rot to say they don’t.”","说医生的嘴很严，都不过是些骗人的鬼话罢了。”"
"Then, “Not that I care a straw who on earth knows.","然后又加了一句：“并不是说我怕让世界上的哪个人知道。"
"Not that I wouldn’t—if you’d have me—blazon it on the skies, or take the front page of the Daily Mirror and have our two names on it, in a heart, you know—pierced by an arrow.”","并不是说我不愿意——如果你愿意让我——把这事到处宣扬的话，或者是把我们俩的名字在《每日镜报》的第一版上刊登出来，把两个名字圈在一颗心上，你知道的——两颗心被一支箭穿过。”"
"Nevertheless, of course, his love of mystery and intrigue, his passion for “keeping our secret beautifully” (his phrase!) had won the day, and off he’d gone in a taxi to fetch this rather sodden-looking little man.","当然，话虽然是这么说的，他还是抑制不住他对于神秘和隐瞒的爱好，他充满了热情，一心只想“把我们俩的秘密守护得严严实实的”（他是这么说的！），因此他雇了辆出租车把这个呆头呆脑的小个子接了来。"
"She heard her untroubled voice saying, “Do you mind not mentioning anything of this to Mr. King?","她听到自己平静地跟他说：“我的情况你什么都不要跟金先生说，可以吗？"
"If you’d tell him that I’m a little run down and that my heart wants a rest.","如果你要说的话，就说我有点儿虚弱，我的心脏需要一些休息。"
"For I’ve been complaining about my heart.”","因为这一阵子，我的心脏就一直有些不舒服。”"
"Roy had been really too right about the kind of man the doctor was.","这个医生是个什么样的人，罗伊果然看得很准。"
"He gave her a strange, quick, leering look, and taking off the stethoscope with shaking fingers he folded it into his bag that looked somehow like a broken old canvas shoe.","他斜着眼睛，快速地看了她一眼，眼神有点儿怪；他一边拿下听诊器，手指有些发抖，再把听诊器收好，塞进包里，那个包有些像是一只破旧的帆布鞋。"
"“Don’t you worry, my dear,” he said huskily.","“别担心，亲爱的，”他声音有些嘶哑，"
"“I’ll see you through.”","“我会帮忙的。”"
"Odious little toad to have asked a favour of!","竟然得向一只讨人嫌的小癞蛤蟆求情！"
"She sprang to her feet, and picking up her purple cloth jacket, went over to the mirror.","她站了起来，把她那件紫色布料上衣捡了起来，走到镜子面前。"
"There was a soft knock at the door, and Roy—he really did look pale, smiling his half-smile—came in and asked the doctor what he had to say.","有一个轻轻的叩门声，罗伊走了进来——他看上去脸色苍白，只露出一半笑容——他想听听医生怎么说。"
"“Well,” said the doctor, taking up his hat, holding it against his chest and beating a tattoo on it, “all I’ve got to say is that Mrs.—h’m—Madam wants a bit of a rest.","“好吧，”医生说，拿起他的帽子按在胸口，手指在帽子上不停地轻叩着，“我要说的就是这位夫人，——嗯——这位女士需要一些休息。"
"She’s a bit run down.","她有点儿虚弱。"
"Her heart’s a bit strained.","她心脏有点儿疲劳过度了。"
"Nothing else wrong.”","除此之外，没有什么其他的问题。”"
"In the street a barrel-organ struck up something gay, laughing, mocking, gushing, with little trills, shakes, jumbles of notes.","街上，手摇风琴奏出了一支轻快的曲子，听起来像是在发笑，在嘲弄，感情奔放，中间夹杂着一串串颤抖的声音。"
"That’s all I got to say, to say,","这就是所有我要说的，所有要说的，"
"That’s all I got to say,","这就是我要说的所有的话。"
"it mocked.","手摇风琴嘲弄着。"
"It sounded so near she wouldn’t have been surprised if the doctor were turning the handle.","琴声离得那么近，如果说是医生在转动那木柄，她一点儿也不会觉得奇怪。"
"She saw Roy’s smile deepen; his eyes took fire.","她看见罗伊的微笑加深了；他的眼睛在发光。"
"He gave a little “Ah!” of relief and happiness.","“啊！”他轻声地吐露他的宽慰和快乐。"
"And just for one moment he allowed himself to gaze at her without caring a jot whether the doctor saw or not, drinking her up with that gaze she knew so well, as she stood tying the pale ribbons of her camisole and drawing on the little purple cloth jacket.","有那么一小会儿，他由着自己高兴，盯着她看，一点儿也不在乎是不是给旁边的医生看到了。她站在那里系上背心上的灰色丝带，穿上那件小小的紫色布料外衣的时候，他只顾盯着她看，那种恨不得一口把她吞下去的眼神，她是十分熟悉的。"
"He jerked back to the doctor, “She shall go away.","他转身对医生说：“她要出门了。"
"She shall go away to the sea at once,” said he, and then, terribly anxious, “What about her food?”","她马上就要到海边去。”接着，，他又很焦虑地问：“那么她的饮食应该怎么安排呢？”"
"At that, buttoning her jacket in the long mirror, she couldn’t help laughing at him.","那个时候，她正对着长镜扣上衣的扣子，一听这话，忍不住朝他笑了。"
"“That’s all very well,” he protested, laughing back delightedly at her and at the doctor.","“这可好得很。”他断言道，高兴地回她一笑，又笑着对医生说，"
"“But if I didn’t manage her food, doctor, she’d never eat anything but caviare sandwiches and—and white grapes.","“如果我不安排好她的食物的话，医生，她可什么都不吃，只吃鱼子酱三明治——和白葡萄。"
"About wine—oughtn’t she to have wine?”","关于酒呢——该不该让她喝点儿酒？”"
"Wine would do her no harm.","酒对她的健康没有什么危害。"
"“Champagne,” pleaded Roy.","“香槟呢？”罗伊恳求似的问道。"
"How he was enjoying himself!","他是多么开心得意啊！"
"“Oh, as much champagne as she likes,” said the doctor, “and a brandy and soda with her lunch if she fancies it.”","“哦，她想喝多少香槟就让她喝多少好了，”医生说，“还有兑了苏打水的白兰地，只要她吃饭的时候爱喝就行了。”"
"Roy loved that; it tickled him immensely.","罗伊就爱那样；他高兴得心里直痒痒。"
"“Do you hear that?” he asked solemnly, blinking and sucking in his cheeks to keep from laughing.","“你听到了吧？”他严肃地说，又是眨眼睛，又是吮吸腮帮子，好让自己不笑出来，"
"“Do you fancy a brandy and soda?”","“你喜欢兑了苏打水的白兰地吗？”"
"And, in the distance, faint and exhausted, the barrel-organ:","在远处，传来了微弱的、精疲力竭的手摇风琴声："
"A brandy and so-da,","一杯兑了苏打水的白兰地，"
"A brandy and soda, please!","请来一杯兑了苏打水的白兰地！"
"A brandy and soda, please!","请来一杯兑了苏打水的白兰地！"
"The doctor seemed to hear that, too.","医生好像也听到了那琴声。"
"He shook hands with her and Roy went with him into the passage to settle his fee.","他跟她握了手，然后罗伊跟他到走廊上商量费用的事情去了。"
"She heard the front door close and then—rapid, rapid steps along the passage.","她听到大门关上的声音——然后是一阵飞快的、飞快的脚步声从走廊上传来。"
"This time he simply burst into her room, and she was in his arms, crushed up small while he kissed her with warm quick kisses, murmuring between them, “My darling, my beauty, my delight.","这次，他直接冲进了她的房间，把她搂进怀中，把她挤成了个小不点儿；同时，他一边热烈地、不停地亲吻她，一边喃喃自语：“我亲爱的，我的美人，我的快乐啊！"
"You’re mine, you’re safe.”","你是我的，你现在安全了。”"
"And then three soft groans.","接着是三声轻柔的叹气声。"
"“Oh!","“啊！"
"Oh!","啊！"
"Oh! the relief!”","啊！这下总算放心了！”"
"Still keeping his arms round her he leant his head against her shoulder as though exhausted.","他仍然抱着她不放，却把头放在她的肩上，好像他已经筋疲力尽了。"
"“If you knew how frightened I’ve been,” he murmured.","“你不知道吧，我心里一直多么紧张啊！”他喃喃低语，"
"“I thought we were in for it this time.","“我以为我们这回是过不去了。"
"I really did.","我真是那么想的。"
"And it would have been so—fatal—so fatal!”","这本来可能是——如此——如此致命的事啊！”"
