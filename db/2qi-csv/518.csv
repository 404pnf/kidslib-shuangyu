"From Each According to His Ability","各尽所能"
"by O. Henry","作者：欧·亨利"
"Vuyning left his club, cursing it softly, without any particular anger.","维宁离开了俱乐部，嘴里轻声咒骂着，其实没有什么惹他生气的事情。"
"From ten in the morning until eleven it had bored him immeasurably.","上午十点到十一点这段时间真是让他烦透了。"
"Kirk with his fish story, Brooks with his Porto Rico cigars, old Morrison with his anecdote about the widow, Hepburn with his invariable luck at billiards—all these afflictions had been repeated without change of bill or scenery.","柯克老是吹牛，布鲁克斯仍抽着他的波多黎各雪茄，老莫里森又在讲那个寡妇的风流韵事，赫伯恩打台球的运气一成不变——这些烦恼每天都一成不变地重复上演。"
"Besides these morning evils Miss Allison had refused him again on the night before.","除了上午这些烦心事之外，艾莉森小姐昨天晚上又一次拒绝了他。"
"But that was a chronic trouble.","不过这个烦恼由来已久了。"
"Five times she had laughed at his offer to make her Mrs. Vuyning.","他已经向她求过五次婚，每次都被她嘲笑一番。"
"He intended to ask her again the next Wednesday evening.","他打算下周三晚上再向她求一次婚。"
"Vuyning walked along Forty-fourth Street to Broadway, and then drifted down the great sluice that washes out the dust of the gold-mines of Gotham.","维宁沿着第四十四大街走到百老汇大街，然后顺着冲洗哥谭镇金矿泥沙的洗矿槽走下去。"
"He wore a morning suit of light gray, low, dull kid shoes, a plain, finely woven straw hat, and his visible linen was the most delicate possible shade of heliotrope.","他身穿一套浅灰色西服，脚蹬一双暗色浅口小山羊皮皮鞋，头戴一顶编织精致的草帽，亚麻衬衫是最浅的淡紫色。"
"His necktie was the blue-gray of a November sky, and its knot was plainly the outcome of a lordly carelessness combined with an accurate conception of the most recent dictum of fashion.","他的领带是十一月天空的蓝灰色，领带结看似打得漫不经心，却完全符合最新的潮流。"
"Now, to write of a man’s haberdashery is a worse thing than to write a historical novel “around” Paul Jones, or to pen a testimonial to a hay-fever cure.","当今，描写男士的服饰衣着比写一部关于保尔·琼斯的历史小说，或者开具花粉病治愈的证明更为糟糕。"
"Therefore, let it be known that the description of Vuyning’s apparel is germane to the movements of the story, and not to make room for the new fall stock of goods.","因此，需要说明一下，关于维宁衣着的描写与故事情节的发展密切相关，而不是为了展示秋季商品的最新款式。"
"Even Broadway that morning was a discord in Vuyning’s ears; and in his eyes it paralleled for a few dreamy, dreary minutes a certain howling, scorching, seething, malodorous slice of street that he remembered in Morocco.","那天早晨，即使百老汇大街在维宁耳中也是嘈杂一片；在那如梦般阴郁的几分钟里，他一度把它看作是记忆中摩洛哥的一段喧嚣、吵闹、炎热、散发着臭味的街道。"
"He saw the struggling mass of dogs, beggars, fakirs, slave-drivers and veiled women in carts without horses, the sun blazing brightly among the bazaars, the piles of rubbish from ruined temples in the street—and then a lady, passing, jabbed the ferrule of a parasol in his side and brought him back to Broadway.","他似乎看到一群吵吵嚷嚷的狗、乞丐、苦行僧、奴隶监工以及坐在没有马的车子里戴着面纱的妇女；阳光毒辣辣地照着集市，四处是寺庙废墟的残砖断瓦——这时，一个路过的妇女将阳伞柄戳在了他的腰上，将他带回到现实的百老汇大街上。"
"Five minutes of his stroll brought him to a certain corner, where a number of silent, pale-faced men are accustomed to stand, immovably, for hours, busy with the file blades of their penknives, with their hat brims on a level with their eyelids.","他溜达了五分钟后，到了一个街角。很多面色苍白、沉默寡言的男人经常在这里一站就是几个钟头，一动不动，摆弄着折叠刀上的指甲锉，他们的帽檐低低地压在眼皮上。"
"Wall Street speculators, driving home in their carriages, love to point out these men to their visiting friends and tell them of this rather famous lounging-place of the “crooks.”","华尔街的投机商坐马车回家时，总喜欢将这些人指给他们来访的朋友看，并告诉他们这是“恶棍们”闲混的著名地点。"
"On Wall Street the speculators never use the file blades of their knives.","投机商们从不在华尔街上使用指甲锉。"
"Vuyning was delighted when one of this company stepped forth and addressed him as he was passing.","维宁经过这些人时，其中一人走上前来跟他打招呼，这让维宁感到很高兴。"
"He was hungry for something out of the ordinary, and to be accosted by this smooth-faced, keen-eyed, low-voiced, athletic member of the under world, with his grim, yet pleasant smile, had all the taste of an adventure to the convention-weary Vuyning.","他正渴望一些不寻常的事情发生，所以有这样一个面庞光洁、目光锐利、声音低沉、体格健壮的下层社会的人带着冷酷却令人愉快的微笑过来搭讪，对于厌倦社会习俗的维宁来说极具冒险的意味。"
"“Excuse me, friend,” said he.","“打扰了，朋友。”那人说，"
"“Could I have a few minutes’ talk with you—on the level?”","“我可以跟你谈几分钟吗？——非常坦率的那种谈话。”"
"“Certainly,” said Vuyning, with a smile.","“当然可以，”维宁微笑着说，"
"“But, suppose we step aside to a quieter place.","“但我们不妨找个安静的地方。"
"There is a divan—a café over here that will do.","有个咖啡馆——这边这个就可以。"
"Schrumm will give us a private corner.”","施拉姆会为我们找个清静的角落。”"
"Schrumm established them under a growing palm, with two seidls between them.","施拉姆将他们安排在一棵棕榈树下，给他们拿了两大杯啤酒。"
"Vuyning made a pleasant reference to meteorological conditions, thus forming a hinge upon which might be swung the door leading from the thought repository of the other.","维宁愉快地谈了几句关于天气的话，从而打开了对方的思路。"
"“In the first place,” said his companion, with the air of one who presents his credentials, “I want you to understand that I am a crook.","“首先，”他的同伴带着一种证明自己身份的样子说，“我希望你知道我是个骗子。”"
"Out West I am known as Rowdy the Dude.","在西部，人们都叫我‘花花公子罗迪’。"
"Pickpocket, supper man, second-story man, yeggman, boxman, all-round burglar, cardsharp and slickest con man west of the Twenty-third Street ferry landing—that’s my history.","第二十三大街轮渡码头以西有名的扒手、飞贼、开保险箱的大盗、拳击手、无所不能的盗贼、玩牌作弊的赌棍和最狡猾的骗子——这就是我的经历。"
"That’s to show I’m on the square—with you.","说这些是为了证明我对你开诚布公。"
"My name’s Emerson.”","我叫埃默森。”"
"“Confound old Kirk with his fish stories,” said Vuyning to himself, with silent glee as he went through his pockets for a card.","“这下老柯克可吹不成牛了。”维宁一边暗自高兴地想着，一边从口袋里掏他的名片。"
"“It’s pronounced ‘Vining,’” he said, as he tossed it over to the other.","“我叫维宁，”他说着把名片扔给了对方，"
"“And I’ll be as frank with you.","“我也会对你开诚布公。"
"I’m just a kind of a loafer, I guess, living on my daddy’s money.","我想我算是那种游手好闲的人，靠我老爸的钱过日子。"
"At the club they call me ‘Left-at-the-Post.’","俱乐部的人都称我是‘留局待领’。"
"I never did a day’s work in my life; and I haven’t the heart to run over a chicken when I’m motoring.","我这辈子，没干过一天活；开车的时候连轧死一只小鸡的勇气也没有。"
"It’s a pretty shabby record, altogether.”","总之我的记录平庸得很。”"
"“There’s one thing you can do,” said Emerson, admiringly; “you can carry duds.","“有一件事你能做到，”埃默森不无羡慕地说，“你是个衣服架子。"
"I’ve watched you several times pass on Broadway.","我几次看见你路过百老汇大街。"
"You look the best dressed man I’ve seen.","你是我见过的着装最得体的人。"
"And I’ll bet you a gold mine I’ve got $50 worth more gent’s furnishings on my frame than you have.","我敢跟你赌一座金矿，我这身穿着比你的贵出五十美元。"
"That’s what I wanted to see you about.","这就是我想请教你的地方。"
"I can’t do the trick.","我怎么穿都不行。"
"Take a look at me.","你看看我。"
"What’s wrong?”","问题出在哪儿呢？”"
"“Stand up,” said Vuyning.","“你站起来。”维宁说。"
"Emerson arose, and slowly revolved.","埃默森依言起立，并缓慢转动身体。"
"“You’ve been ‘outfitted,’” declared the clubman.","“你确实‘装备’了一番。”维宁说道，"
"“Some Broadway window-dresser has misused you.","“你被百老汇的橱窗设计师坑了。"
"That’s an expensive suit, though, Emerson.”","不过这套衣服可是价格不菲呀，埃默森。”"
"“A hundred dollars,” said Emerson.","“一百美元。”埃默森说。"
"“Twenty too much,” said Vuyning.","“多花了二十美元，”维宁说道，"
"“Six months old in cut, one inch too long, and half an inch too much lapel.","“式样过时了六个月，上衣长了一寸，翻领宽了半寸。"
"Your hat is plainly dated one year ago, although there’s only a sixteenth of an inch lacking in the brim to tell the story.","你的帽子很明显是一年前的式样，虽然帽檐只窄了十六分之一寸。"
"That English poke in your collar is too short by the distance between Troy and London.","你硬领的英式衬头实在短了太多。"
"A plain gold link cuff-button would take all the shine out of those pearl ones with diamond settings.","纯金的衬衫袖口链扣会比珍珠镶钻的更显眼。"
"Those tan shoes would be exactly the articles to work into the heart of a Brooklyn school-ma’am on a two weeks’ visit to Lake Ronkonkoma.","你脚上那双黄皮鞋，只能用来打动去隆贡科马湖度假的布鲁克林女教师的芳心。"
"I think I caught a glimpse of a blue silk sock embroidered with russet lilies of the valley when you—improperly—drew up your trousers as you sat down.","刚才你坐下的时候，你提了一下裤子——这不合礼仪——我瞥见你穿了绣着黄褐色铃兰花样的蓝色丝袜。"
"There are always plain ones to be had in the stores.","单色无花的袜子很容易在百货商店里买到。"
"Have I hurt your feelings, Emerson?”","我这么说是不是伤了你的自尊，埃默森。”"
"“Double the ante!” cried the criticised one, greedily.","“赌注加倍！”挨批评的人贪婪地喊道，"
"“Give me more of it.","“再多指点儿我一些吧。"
"There’s a way to tote the haberdashery, and I want to get wise to it.","如何穿着是门学问，我想了解一下。"
"Say, you’re the right kind of a swell.","嘿，你真懂行。"
"Anything else to the queer about me?”","我身上还有什么不妥的地方吗？”"
"“Your tie,” said Vuyning, “is tied with absolute precision and correctness.”","“你的领带，”维宁说，“打得非常精准，绝对规矩。”"
"“Thanks,” gratefully—“I spent over half an hour at it before I—”","“谢谢，”埃默森感激地说，“我花了半个多小时才——”"
"“Thereby,” interrupted Vuyning, “completing your resemblance to a dummy in a Broadway store window.”","“因此，”维宁插嘴说，“你更像百老汇商店橱窗里的模特了。”"
"“Yours truly,” said Emerson, sitting down again.","“确实如此，”埃默森说着又坐了下来，"
"“It’s bully of you to put me wise.","“你能给我指正真是太好了。"
"I knew there was something wrong, but I couldn’t just put my finger on it.","我知道穿得不对劲，可就是不知道哪儿不对劲。"
"I guess it comes by nature to know how to wear clothes.”","我想穿衣大概也是需要天分的吧。”"
"“Oh, I suppose,” said Vuyning, with a laugh, “that my ancestors picked up the knack while they were peddling clothes from house to house a couple of hundred years ago.","“哦，”维宁大笑道，“我想可能我的祖先在几百年前挨家挨户兜售衣服的时候学会了穿衣的技巧吧。"
"I’m told they did that.”","据说他们是干这一行的。”"
"“And mine,” said Emerson, cheerfully, “were making their visits at night, I guess, and didn’t have a chance to catch on to the correct styles.”","“那我的祖先，”埃默森快活地说，“大概正在夜里串门走户，所以没有机会了解正确的穿戴方式。”"
"“I tell you what,” said Vuyning, whose ennui had taken wings, “I’ll take you to my tailor.","“我跟你说，”维宁已有些倦意，“我带你去我的裁缝那儿。"
"He’ll eliminate the mark of the beast from your exterior.","他会将你外表所有不顺眼的地方统统去掉。"
"That is, if you care to go any further in the way of expense.”","当然，如果你不介意多花些钱的话。”"
"“Play ’em to the ceiling,” said Emerson, with a boyish smile of joy.","“我不在乎花多少钱。”埃默森高兴得像个孩子似的说，"
"“I’ve got a roll as big around as a barrel of black-eyed peas and as loose as the wrapper of a two-for-fiver.","“我的钱多得像桶里的豆子那样不计其数，随我任意花。"
"I don’t mind telling you that I was not touring among the Antipodes when the burglar-proof safe of the Farmers’ National Bank of Butterville, Ia., flew open some moonless nights ago to the tune of $16,000.”","我不妨告诉你，前些时候的一天夜里，爱荷华州巴特维尔国家农业银行的防盗保险柜被撬，丢失了一万六千元，我那个时候可没在新西兰安蒂波德斯群岛旅游。”"
"“Aren’t you afraid,” asked Vuyning, “that I’ll call a cop and hand you over?”","“你难道不怕我叫警察把你抓走吗？”维宁问道。"
"“You tell me,” said Emerson, coolly, “why I didn’t keep them.”","“我知道你不会，”埃默森冷静地说，“所以我把它们还给你。”"
"He laid Vuyning’s pocketbook and watch—the Vuyning 100-year-old family watch—on the table.","他把维宁的钱包和怀表——维宁家传百年的怀表——放在了桌上。"
"“Man,” said Vuyning, revelling, “did you ever hear the tale Kirk tells about the six-pound trout and the old fisherman?”","“嗨，”维宁兴奋地说，“你有没有听过柯克讲的六镑重的鲑鱼和老渔夫的故事？”"
"“Seems not,” said Emerson, politely.","“好像没有，”埃默森礼貌地说，"
"“I’d like to.”","“我愿意听一听。”"
"“But you won’t,” said Vuyning.","“但是你听不成了。”维宁说，"
"“I’ve heard it scores of times.","“我都听了几十遍了。"
"That’s why I won’t tell you.","所以不想讲给你听了。"
"I was just thinking how much better this is than a club.","我觉得我们在一起可比在俱乐部有意思多了。"
"Now, shall we go to my tailor?”","现在，去找我的裁缝如何？”"
"“Boys, and elderly gents,” said Vuyning, five days later at his club, standing up against the window where his coterie was gathered, and keeping out the breeze, “a friend of mine from the West will dine at our table this evening.”","“老少爷们儿，”五天后，在俱乐部里，维宁靠窗站着，向聚在一起的朋友们悄悄宣布，“今晚，我的一个来自西部的朋友将和我们共进晚餐。”"
"“Will he ask if we have heard the latest from Denver?” said a member, squirming in his chair.","“他会不会问我们关于丹佛的最新消息啊？”一个俱乐部会员局促不安地坐在椅子上问。"
"“Will he mention the new twenty-three-story Masonic Temple, in Quincy, Ill.?” inquired another, dropping his nose-glasses.","“他会不会提起伊利诺斯州昆西市新的二十三层高的新共济会大楼？”另一个会员放下夹鼻眼镜问道。"
"“Will he spring one of those Western Mississippi River catfish stories, in which they use yearling calves for bait?” demanded Kirk, fiercely.","“他会给我们讲那些在密西西比河用小牛犊做诱饵抓鲶鱼的故事吗？”柯克急切地问道。"
"“Be comforted,” said Vuyning.","“放心吧，”维宁说，"
"“He has none of the little vices.","“他不会讲这些小事的。"
"He is a burglar and safe-blower, and a pal of mine.”","他是个窃贼，撬保险箱的，也是我的朋友。”"
"“Oh, Mary Ann!” said they.","“啊，天哪！”他们惊呼，"
"“Must you always adorn every statement with your alleged humor?”","“你一定是在开玩笑吧？”"
"It came to pass that at eight in the evening a calm, smooth, brilliant, affable man sat at Vuyning’s right hand during dinner.","那天晚上八点钟，一个神态镇定、举止优雅、光彩照人、和蔼可亲的人吃饭时坐在维宁的右手边。"
"And when the ones who pass their lives in city streets spoke of skyscrapers or of the little Czar on his far, frozen throne, or of insignificant fish from inconsequential streams, this big, deep-chested man, faultlessly clothed, and eyed like an Emperor, disposed of their Lilliputian chatter with a wink of his eyelash.","当那些生活在城市里的人们谈到摩天大楼、遥远国度里坐在冰冷宝座上的小沙皇，或者不知名小溪中微不足道的小鱼时，这个身材高大、穿着无可挑剔、有帝王般气度的男人眨了眨眼睛就结束了他们小人国似的闲谈。"
"And then he painted for them with hard, broad strokes a marvellous lingual panorama of the West.","接着，他用语言粗线条地为众人描绘了一幅精彩的西部画面。"
"He stacked snow-topped mountains on the table, freezing the hot dishes of the waiting diners.","他把白雪覆顶的群山堆在餐桌上，使热腾腾的菜肴都结了冰。"
"With a wave of his hand he swept the clubhouse into a pine-crowned gorge, turning the waiters into a grim posse, and each listener into a blood-stained fugitive, climbing with torn fingers upon the ensanguined rocks.","他一挥手就把整个俱乐部都扫进长满松树的大峡谷，侍者变成了凶恶的暴徒，每一个听者都成了浑身血污的逃亡者，用磨破的手攀登染满血的岩石。"
"He touched the table and spake, and the five panted as they gazed on barren lava beds, and each man took his tongue between his teeth and felt his mouth bake at the tale of a land empty of water and food.","他把手放在桌上继续讲，五个听者好像看到光秃秃的火山岩床，不禁气喘吁吁，当听他讲到这片没有水和食物的土地时，每个人都感到口干舌燥。"
"As simply as Homer sang, while he dug a tine of his fork leisurely into the tablecloth, he opened a new world to their view, as does one who tells a child of the Looking-Glass Country.","他一面悠闲地用叉子戳着桌布，一面像荷马说唱似的向人们展示了一个全新的世界，正如对儿童讲《镜中世界》的故事。"
"As one of his listeners might have spoken of tea too strong at a Madison Square “afternoon,” so he depicted the ravages of “redeye” in a border town when the caballeros of the lariat and “forty-five” reduced ennui to a minimum.","就像一般人讨论麦迪逊广场的茶会那样，他轻松平常地讲述了边境小镇上一个叫“红眼”的人的暴行、牛仔的套索和四五口径左轮手枪，使听他说话的人毫无倦意。"
"And then, with a sweep of his white, unringed hands, he dismissed Melpomene, and forthwith Diana and Amaryllis footed it before the mind’s eyes of the clubmen.","然后，他一挥那只白皙的、没有戴戒指的手，不再讲悲剧故事，而是带领俱乐部会员们进入了美妙浪漫的幻境。"
"The savannas of the continent spread before them.","一片热带大草原展现在人们面前。"
"The wind, humming through a hundred leagues of sage brush and mesquite, closed their ears to the city’s staccato noises.","风吹拂过几百里格山艾灌木丛和牧豆树，盖过了城市的喧嚣。"
"He told them of camps, of ranches marooned in a sea of fragrant prairie blossoms, of gallops in the stilly night that Apollo would have forsaken his daytime steeds to enjoy; he read them the great, rough epic of the cattle and the hills that have not been spoiled by the hand of man, the mason.","他讲了野外露营的故事，描述了点缀草原花海的牧场，寂静夜晚里的策马奔驰，即使是阿波罗，也会扔下白日的座驾来这里享受一番。他还讲述了牛群伟大粗犷的史诗以及未受到人类破坏的自然风光。"
"His words were a telescope to the city men, whose eyes had looked upon Youngstown, O., and whose tongues had called it “West.”","他的话使城市居民大开眼界，曾经，他们眼中的“西部”就是俄亥俄州扬斯敦。"
"In fact, Emerson had them “going.”","实际上，埃默森使他们着了迷。"
"The next morning at ten he met Vuyning, by appointment, at a Forty-second Street café.","第二天上午十点，埃默森如约在第四十二大街上的一家咖啡馆里与维宁见面。"
"Emerson was to leave for the West that day.","当天，埃默森就要动身去西部了。"
"He wore a suit of dark cheviot that looked to have been draped upon him by an ancient Grecian tailor who was a few thousand years ahead of the styles.","他穿着一套深色的舍维呢衣服，好像由一位意识超前几千年的古希腊裁缝为他裁制的。"
"“Mr. Vuyning,” said he, with the clear, ingenuous smile of the successful “crook,” “it’s up to me to go the limit for you any time I can do so.","“维宁先生，”他带着成功“歹徒”的坦率笑容说，“以后你有用得着我的时候尽管吩咐。"
"You’re the real thing; and if I can ever return the favor, you bet your life I’ll do it.”","你真够朋友；只要是我能为你做的，我一定赴汤蹈火在所不惜。"
"“What was that cow-puncher’s name?” asked Vuyning, “who used to catch a mustang by the nose and mane, and throw him till he put the bridle on?”","“那个牛仔的名字叫什么来着？”维宁问道，“就是能抓住马鼻和马鬃把马掀翻在地，直到戴上马笼头的那个人？”"
"“Bates,” said Emerson.","“贝兹。”埃默森说。"
"“Thanks,” said Vuyning.","“谢谢，”维宁说，"
"“I thought it was Yates.","“我还以为是耶茨呢。"
"Oh, about that toggery business—I’d forgotten that.”","哦，还有衣服那个事——我差点儿忘了。”"
"“I’ve been looking for some guy to put me on the right track for years,” said Emerson.","“多年来我一直在找能指点我的人。”埃默森说，"
"“You’re the goods, duty free, and half-way to the warehouse in a red wagon.”","“你就是这个人，就像装在红色货车上进库的免税商品。”"
"“Bacon, toasted on a green willow switch over red coals, ought to put broiled lobsters out of business,” said Vuyning.","“在炭火上架上绿柳条烤肉比烤虾的味道好多了。”维宁说，"
"“And you say a horse at the end of a thirty-foot rope can’t pull a ten-inch stake out of wet prairie?","“你说一匹马拴在三十英尺的绳子的一端，连打在湿草地上一根十寸长的木桩也拔不起来？"
"Well, good-bye, old man, if you must be off.”","好吧，再见了，老兄，如果你执意要走的话。”"
"At one o’clock Vuyning had luncheon with Miss Allison by previous arrangement.","一点钟，按照事先约定，维宁和艾莉森小姐共进午餐。"
"For thirty minutes he babbled to her, unaccountably, of ranches, horses, cañons, cyclones, round-ups, Rocky Mountains and beans and bacon.","足足有三十分钟，他一直在和她大谈特谈牧场、马匹、峡谷、飓风、西部集会、落基山、扁豆和熏肉。"
"She looked at him with wondering and half-terrified eyes.","艾利森小姐惊奇而又有些害怕地看着他。"
"“I was going to propose again to-day,” said Vuyning, cheerily, “but I won’t.","“我本打算今天再向你求婚的，”维宁快活地说，“但是现在我不会了。"
"I’ve worried you often enough.","我烦扰你够多的了。"
"You know dad has a ranch in Colorado.","你知道，我父亲在科罗拉多州有个牧场。"
"What’s the good of staying here?","待在这里有什么好处？"
"Jumping jonquils! but it’s great out there.","无聊死了！那儿的生活才叫棒呢。"
"I’m going to start next Tuesday.”","我准备下周二就动身。”"
"“No, you won’t,” said Miss Allison.","“不，不行。”艾莉森小姐说。"
"“What?” said Vuyning.","“怎么了？”维宁说。"
"“Not alone,” said Miss Allison, dropping a tear upon her salad.","“不要一个人去，”艾莉森小姐说着，眼泪滴到她吃的沙拉上面，"
"“What do you think?”","“好不好？”"
"“Betty!” exclaimed Vuyning, “what do you mean?","“贝蒂！”维宁惊呼道，“你的意思是？……”"
"“I’ll go too,” said Miss Allison, forcibly.","“我也去。”艾莉森小姐坚定地说。"
"Vuyning filled her glass with Apollinaris.","维宁给她的杯子斟满了阿波利纳里斯矿泉水。"
"“Here’s to Rowdy the Dude!” he gave—a toast mysterious.","“为‘花花公子罗迪’干杯！”他有些神秘地说。"
"“Don’t know him,” said Miss Allison; “but if he’s your friend, Jimmy—here goes!”","“虽然我不认识他，”艾莉森小姐说，“但如果是你的朋友，杰米——我们就干杯吧！”"
