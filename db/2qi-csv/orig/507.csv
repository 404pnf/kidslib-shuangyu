"CHAPTER I.","第一章"
"When Death is present in a household on a Christmas Day, the very contrast between the time as it now is, and the day as it has often been, gives a poignancy to sorrow—a more utter blankness to the desolation.","当死神在圣诞日降临，对于一个家庭而言，与平日形成鲜明对比的是，此时此刻的悲伤中又平添了一股辛酸——就好比荒凉之中多了一片更彻底的空白。"
"James Leigh died just as the far-away bells of Rochdale Church were ringing for morning service on Christmas Day, 1836.","1836年，圣诞日，罗奇代尔教堂那遥远的早礼拜钟声刚刚敲响，詹姆斯·利去世了。"
"A few minutes before his death, he opened his already glazing eyes, and made a sign to his wife, by the faint motion of his lips, that he had yet something to say.","去世前几分钟，他睁开了那双已经呆滞无神的眼睛，嘴唇微微颤动，向妻子示意他还有话要交代。"
"She stooped close down, and caught the broken whisper, “I forgive her, Annie!","她俯下身靠近他，听到了那断断续续的耳语：“我原谅她，安妮！"
"May God forgive me!”","愿上帝原谅我！”"
"“Oh, my love, my dear! only get well, and I will never cease showing my thanks for those words.","“哦，我的爱人，我亲爱的！赶快好起来吧，我会永远感激你说的这些话的。"
"May God in heaven bless thee for saying them.","愿上帝因你说的这些话保佑你！"
"Thou’rt not so restless, my lad! may be—Oh, God!”","安息吧，我的爱人！也许——哦，上帝啊！”"
"For even while she spoke he died.","她的话尚未说完，他便撒手人寰。"
"They had been two-and-twenty years man and wife; for nineteen of those years their life had been as calm and happy as the most perfect uprightness on the one side, and the most complete confidence and loving submission on the other, could make it.","他们结为夫妇已有二十二年了，其中的十九年中，他们一方是正气满身，另一方则是自信与谦恭兼备，这样的结合使得他们的生活过得平静而且幸福。"
"Milton’s famous line might have been framed and hung up as the rule of their married life, for he was truly the interpreter, who stood between God and her; she would have considered herself wicked if she had ever dared even to think him austere, though as certainly as he was an upright man, so surely was he hard, stern, and inflexible.","弥尔顿的名言可能会被镶框并被挂起来作为他们婚姻生活的准则，他是上帝和她之间真正的阐释者；她甚至都不敢把他想成严厉的人，那样她会觉得自己是邪恶的，但正如他肯定是一个正直的人那样，他也无疑是一个冷酷、严厉和顽固的人。"
"But for three years the moan and the murmur had never been out of her heart; she had rebelled against her husband as against a tyrant, with a hidden, sullen rebellion, which tore up the old landmarks of wifely duty and affection, and poisoned the fountains whence gentlest love and reverence had once been for ever springing.","但是近三年来，她心中的不满和抱怨从来就没有消散过；她像反抗一个暴君那样，以一种隐忍、乖戾的方式来对抗她的丈夫，这摧毁了那过去象征妻子责任和感情的标志，也毒化了那曾经不断涌出温柔的爱意和敬畏的喷泉。"
"But those last blessed words replaced him on his throne in her heart, and called out penitent anguish for all the bitter estrangement of later years.","可是他最后那些祝福的话又把他重新放回了她心目中的王座上，并且唤起了由于过去几年那所有辛酸的隔阂带来的忏悔的痛苦。"
"It was this which made her refuse all the entreaties of her sons, that she would see the kind-hearted neighbours, who called on their way from church, to sympathize and condole.","正因如此，当她的儿子们恳求她出来会见那些好心从教堂归来后登门拜访表示同情和慰问的邻居们时，她断然拒绝。"
"No! she would stay with the dead husband that had spoken tenderly at last, if for three years he had kept silence; who knew but what, if she had only been more gentle and less angrily reserved he might have relented earlier—and in time?","不！她要守在她那已经过世的丈夫身边，虽然三年来他一直保持沉默，但他最后的话语却是那么体贴；如果她之前能够表现得更加温柔一点儿，没那么愤怒和冷淡，他的态度或许会早一点儿，甚至及时得到缓和，这又有谁知道呢？"
"She sat rocking herself to and fro by the side of the bed, while the footsteps below went in and out; she had been in sorrow too long to have any violent burst of deep grief now; the furrows were well worn in her cheeks, and the tears flowed quietly, if incessantly, all the day long.","她坐在床边，来回摆动着身体，楼下脚步声进出不断；她已经悲伤得太久，现在不会再有任何沉痛的激烈爆发；她的脸颊布满泪痕，眼泪无声地滑落，一整天来从未间断。"
"But when the winter’s night drew on, and the neighbours had gone away to their homes, she stole to the window, and gazed out, long and wistfully, over the dark grey moors.","但是随着冬日夜晚的临近，邻居们也各自回家了，她悄悄地靠近窗口，长久地凝视着深灰色的荒野，若有所思。"
"She did not hear her son’s voice, as he spoke to her from the door, nor his footstep as he drew nearer.","她没有听到儿子在门口跟她说话的声音，也没有听到他走近时的脚步声。"
"She started when he touched her.","当他碰到她时，她吓了一跳。"
"“Mother! come down to us.","“妈妈！和我们一起到楼下来。"
"There’s no one but Will and me.","那儿只有我和威尔。"
"Dearest mother, we do so want you.”","最亲爱的妈妈，我们很需要你。”"
"The poor lad’s voice trembled, and he began to cry.","这可怜的孩子声音发颤，哭了起来。"
"It appeared to require an effort on Mrs. Leigh’s part to tear herself away from the window, but with a sigh she complied with his request.","利太太看起来似乎并不太愿意离开窗前，但她只是叹了口气，还是答应了孩子的请求。"
"The two boys (for though Will was nearly twenty-one, she still thought of him as a lad) had done everything in their power to make the house-place comfortable for her.","两个孩子（尽管威尔已经快二十一岁了，她仍然把他当作孩子来看待）已经做了他们能做的一切，尽可能使她在房子里感到舒适。"
"She herself, in the old days before her sorrow, had never made a brighter fire or a cleaner hearth, ready for her husband’s return home, than now awaited her.","就连她自己，在经历这些悲痛之前的日子里，也从来没有像现在孩子们等待她这样，把火烧得那么旺，把炉子收拾得那么干净，来等待她的丈夫回家。"
"The tea-things were all put out, and the kettle was boiling; and the boys had calmed their grief down into a kind of sober cheerfulness.","茶具已经全部摆好，水壶也在沸腾；两个孩子已经冷静下来，不再悲伤，并且有了一丝审慎的喜悦。"
"They paid her every attention they could think of, but received little notice on her part; she did not resist, she rather submitted to all their arrangements; but they did not seem to touch her heart.","他们想尽一切办法来关注她，而她却对此不以为然；她没有反抗，而是宁愿顺从他们所有的安排，但是他们的所作所为似乎并没有触及她的内心世界。"
"When tea was ended—it was merely the form of tea that had been gone through—Will moved the things away to the dresser.","喝完茶——其实只不过是过去喝茶的那种形式而已——威尔把茶具收回到了餐具柜中。"
"His mother leant back languidly in her chair.","他的母亲则懒懒地向后靠在椅子里。"
"“Mother, shall Tom read you a chapter?","“母亲，让汤姆给你读一段文章吧？"
"He’s a better scholar than I.”","他的学问比我高。”"
"“Ay, lad!” said she, almost eagerly.","“好的，孩子！”她回答道，几乎是迫不及待，"
"“That’s it.","“这样吧。"
"Read me the Prodigal Son.","给我读下浪子回头的故事吧。"
"Ay, ay, lad.","对，对，孩子。"
"Thank thee.”","谢谢你。”"
"Tom found the chapter, and read it in the high-pitched voice which is customary in village schools.","汤姆找到了那一章，以一种在乡村学校里惯用的高音来诵读。"
"His mother bent forward, her lips parted, her eyes dilated; her whole body instinct with eager attention.","他的母亲身体前倾，嘴巴张开，双眼圆睁，她的整个身体充满了热切的关注。"
"Will sat with his head depressed and hung down.","威尔则垂头丧气地坐在一边。"
"He knew why that chapter had been chosen; and to him it recalled the family’s disgrace.","他清楚母亲为什么选择那一章，这让他想起了他们家庭的耻辱。"
"When the reading was ended, he still hung down his head in gloomy silence.","诵读结束时，他仍然低垂着脑袋，闷不作声。"
"But her face was brighter than it had been before for the day.","但是他母亲的脸色比这天早些时候要开朗了许多。"
"Her eyes looked dreamy, as if she saw a vision; and by-and-by she pulled the Bible towards her, and, putting her finger underneath each word, began to read them aloud in a low voice to herself; she read again the words of bitter sorrow and deep humiliation; but most of all, she paused and brightened over the father’s tender reception of the repentant prodigal.","她的双眼开始朦胧，仿佛看到了一个幻影；她把圣经慢慢地拉向自己，手指放在每一行字下面，开始以一种低沉的声音大声地读给自己听；她再一次品读这些充满了苦涩的伤痛和深深的羞辱的文字；但是最重要的是，她在读到浪子回头中父亲以温柔的情怀迎回悔改的浪子时，她停顿了下来，人也变得活泼了许多。"
"So passed the Christmas evening in the Upclose Farm.","阿普克洛斯农场的圣诞夜晚就这样过去了。"
"The snow had fallen heavily over the dark waving moorland before the day of the funeral.","葬礼前一天，大雪在黑暗起伏的荒野里肆虐。"
"The black storm-laden dome of heaven lay very still and close upon the white earth, as they carried the body forth out of the house which had known his presence so long as its ruling power.","风暴充斥的黑色苍穹静静地覆盖在皑皑的大地上，人们把詹姆斯·利的尸体从他一直居住的房子里抬了出来。"
"Two and two the mourners followed, making a black procession, in their winding march over the unbeaten snow, to Milne Row Church; now lost in some hollow of the bleak moors, now slowly climbing the heaving ascents.","送葬者们成双结对地跟在后面，形成了一条黑色的队伍，蜿蜒前行在人迹罕至的雪地上，向米尔恩·罗教堂走去；一会儿消失在某处空旷荒凉的沼泽地里，一会儿又缓慢地攀登在起伏的山坡上。"
"There was no long tarrying after the funeral, for many of the neighbours who accompanied the body to the grave had far to go, and the great white flakes which came slowly down were the boding forerunners of a heavy storm.","葬礼后，许多陪送遗体来送葬的邻居并没有耽搁太久，他们还有很长的一段路要走回去，缓慢飘落的大片雪花也向人们预告着一场大风暴的来临。"
"One old friend alone accompanied the widow and her sons to their home.","最后陪伴这可怜的寡妇和她的孩子回家的，是一个老朋友。"
"The Upclose Farm had belonged for generations to the Leighs; and yet its possession hardly raised them above the rank of labourers.","利家人拥有阿普克洛斯农场已经有好几代了，但这却并没有使他们的身份比普通的劳动者高出多少。"
"There was the house and out-buildings, all of an old-fashioned kind, and about seven acres of barren unproductive land, which they had never possessed capital enough to improve; indeed, they could hardly rely upon it for subsistence; and it had been customary to bring up the sons to some trade, such as a wheelwright’s or blacksmith’s.","农场的房子及其附属建筑都很老式，还有大约七英亩的荒芜贫瘠的土地一直缺乏足够的资金来改善；事实上，他们很难依靠这片土地来维持生计，因此，两个男孩很早就习惯了去学习掌握一些其他的手艺，比如车轮修造或者锻工。"
"James Leigh had left a will in the possession of the old man who accompanied them home.","詹姆斯·利留下的一封遗嘱由陪他们一起回家的老人保管。"
"He read it aloud.","他大声地宣读遗嘱。"
"James had bequeathed the farm to his faithful wife, Anne Leigh, for her lifetime, and afterwards to his son William.","詹姆斯把农场留给了他忠贞的妻子，安妮·利终身所有，在她之后是他的儿子威廉。"
"The hundred and odd pounds in the savings bank was to accumulate for Thomas.","而储蓄账户中的一百多英镑则作为积累财富留给了托马斯。"
"After the reading was ended, Anne Leigh sat silent for a time and then she asked to speak to Samuel Orme alone.","遗嘱宣读完毕后，安妮·利默不作声地坐了一会儿，然后她要求和塞缪尔·奥姆单独谈谈。"
"The sons went into the back kitchen, and thence strolled out into the fields regardless of the driving snow.","两个孩子走进了后厨房，从那里溜达了出去，冒着大雪，来到了田间。"
"The brothers were dearly fond of each other, although they were very different in character.","兄弟两个尽管在性格上非常不同，他们之间的感情却非常深厚。"
"Will, the elder, was like his father, stern, reserved, and scrupulously upright.","威尔，作为大哥，和他的父亲一样，严肃，缄默，是一个满身正气的人。"
"Tom (who was ten years younger) was gentle and delicate as a girl, both in appearance and character.","而比威尔小十岁的汤姆则无论从外貌上还是性格上都表现得非常温和、娇弱，像个女孩子一样。"
"He had always clung to his mother and dreaded his father.","一直以来，他总是害怕父亲，而粘在母亲的身边。"
"They did not speak as they walked, for they were only in the habit of talking about facts, and hardly knew the more sophisticated language applied to the description of feelings.","他们默不作声地走着，因为他们习惯了只在讨论事情时说话，很少会用复杂的语言来描述内心的感受。"
"Meanwhile their mother had taken hold of Samuel Orme’s arm with her trembling hand.","此时，他们的母亲用颤抖的手紧紧抓住塞缪尔·奥姆的手臂。"
"“Samuel, I must let the farm—I must.”","“塞缪尔，我必须得把农场租出去——我必须得这么做。”"
"“Let the farm!","“把农场租出去！"
"What’s come o’er the woman?”","你怎么了？”"
"“Oh, Samuel!” said she, her eyes swimming in tears, “I’m just fain to go and live in Manchester.","“噢，塞缪尔！”她双眼满含热泪，“我想搬去曼彻斯特住。"
"I mun let the farm.”","我必须得把农场租出去。”"
"Samuel looked, and pondered, but did not speak for some time.","塞缪尔看着她，深思着，有一段时间没有说话。"
"At last he said—","最后他说道："
"“If thou hast made up thy mind, there’s no speaking again it; and thou must e’en go.","“如果你已经下定了决心，那就没有争论的必要了，你一定要去的。"
"Thou’lt be sadly pottered wi’ Manchester ways; but that’s not my look out.","你会受不了曼彻斯特的生活方式的，但这并不是我应该担心的。"
"Why, thou’lt have to buy potatoes, a thing thou hast never done afore in all thy born life.","唉，你将不得不去买土豆，这是你从出生到现在都没有做过的事情。"
"Well! it’s not my look out.","好啦！这也不是我应该担心的。"
"It’s rather for me than again me.","实际上你这样做对我也是有好处的。"
"Our Jenny is going to be married to Tom Higginbotham, and he was speaking of wanting a bit of land to begin upon.","我的女儿珍妮马上要和汤姆·希金博特姆结婚了，他说想要一片土地来耕种。　"
"His father will be dying sometime, I reckon, and then he’ll step into the Croft Farm.","他的父亲早晚会过世的，我估计到那时他将会继承克罗夫特农场。"
"But meanwhile—”","但是，在那之前——”"
"“Then, thou’lt let the farm,” said she, still as eagerly as ever.","“那么说，你会租下农场。”她说道，和之前一样迫切。"
"“Ay, ay, he’ll take it fast enough, I’ve a notion.","“当然，当然，我想他会很快租下农场的。"
"But I’ll not drive a bargain with thee just now; it would not be right; we’ll wait a bit.”","但是我不会现在就和你讨价还价的，现在还不太合适，我们可以等一下。”"
"“No; I cannot wait; settle it out at once.”","“不，我不能等了，现在就定下来吧。”"
"“Well, well; I’ll speak to Will about it.","“好吧，好吧，我会和威尔谈这件事的。"
"I see him out yonder.","我看见他在那边。"
"I’ll step to him and talk it over.”","我现在就过去和他讨论这件事。”"
"Accordingly he went and joined the two lads, and, without more ado, began the subject to them.","于是他走过去加入到两个小伙子当中，开门见山地和他们提起了这件事情。"
"“Will, thy mother is fain to go live in Manchester, and covets to let the farm.","“威尔，你的母亲想去曼彻斯特居住并且渴望把农场租出去。"
"Now, I’m willing to take it for Tom Higginbotham; but I like to drive a keen bargain, and there would be no fun chaffering with thy mother just now.","因此，我想把它租给汤姆·希金博特姆，但是我希望能快点儿成交，现在和你母亲讨价还价并不好受。"
"Let thee and me buckle to, my lad! and try and cheat each other; it will warm us this cold day.”","让我们一起努力吧，孩子们！试着去哄骗一下彼此，会让我们在这寒冷日子感到温暖的。”"
"“Let the farm!” said both the lads at once, with infinite surprise.","“出租农场？”两个孩子大吃一惊，齐声嚷道，"
"“Go live in Manchester!”","“去曼彻斯特居住？”"
"When Samuel Orme found that the plan had never before been named to either Will or Tom, he would have nothing to do with it, he said, until they had spoken to their mother.","当塞缪尔·奥姆发现无论是威尔还是汤姆都对这个计划事先一无所知时，他表示，在孩子们和他们的母亲没有讨论这件事之前，他什么也不会做的。"
"Likely she was “dazed” by her husband’s death; he would wait a day or two, and not name it to any one; not to Tom Higginbotham himself, or may be he would set his heart upon it.","她很可能是因为丈夫的去世才“鬼迷心窍”，他会等上一两天，在这之前他不会向任何人提起此事，尤其是汤姆·希金博特姆，不然他可能会为此打定主意的。"
"The lads had better go in and talk it over with their mother.","孩子们则最好回去和他们的母亲讨论下这件事情。"
"He bade them good-day, and left them.","他告别了他们，离开了。"
"Will looked very gloomy, but he did not speak till they got near the house.","威尔看上去非常忧郁，但是直到他们靠近房子时，他才开口说话。"
"Then he said—","他说道："
"“Tom, go to th’ shippon, and supper the cows.","“汤姆，去牛舍看看，喂一下奶牛。"
"I want to speak to mother alone.”","我想和母亲单独谈谈。”"
"When he entered the house-place, she was sitting before the fire, looking into its embers.","当他走进房间的时候，她正坐在火炉边，眼睛盯着里面的炭火。"
"She did not hear him come in: for some time she had lost her quick perception of outward things.","她没有听到他进来的声音：她对外界事物的感知已经有一段时间不像以前那样快速了。"
"“Mother! what’s this about going to Manchester?” asked he.","“妈妈！为什么要去曼彻斯特？”他问道。"
"“Oh, lad!” said she, turning round, and speaking in a beseeching tone, “I must go and seek our Lizzie.","“哦，孩子！”她说道，转过身来，带着一种近乎恳求的语气，“我必须去寻找我们的莉齐。"
"I cannot rest here for thinking on her.","呆在这儿想她，我无法安心。"
"Many’s the time I’ve left thy father sleeping in bed, and stole to th’ window, and looked and looked my heart out towards Manchester, till I thought I must just set out and tramp over moor and moss straight away till I got there, and then lift up every downcast face till I came to our Lizzie.","很多次我在你父亲睡着的时候离开床畔，悄悄地来到窗前，就这么望着，望着，我的心也飘向了曼彻斯特，直到我认为我必须立刻启程，越过荒野和沼泽，一路到那儿，然后抬起一张张低垂的脸，直到找到我们的莉齐。"
"And often, when the south wind was blowing soft among the hollows, I’ve fancied (it could but be fancy, thou knowest) I heard her crying upon me; and I’ve thought the voice came closer and closer, till at last it was sobbing out, ‘Mother!’ close to the door; and I’ve stolen down, and undone the latch before now, and looked out into the still, black night, thinking to see her—and turned sick and sorrowful when I heard no living sound but the sough of the wind dying away.","时常，当南风轻拂在山谷中时，我想象（也只能是想象，你知道的）我听到了她在恳求我，我感到她的声音越来越近，到最后成了在门前喊‘妈妈’的哭诉，于是我悄悄地下楼，打开门闩，向外面寂静、漆黑的夜晚望去，想着能看到她——结果是让人失望和伤心的，我听不到一丝活着的声音，只有逐渐逝去的飒飒的风声。"
"Oh, speak not to me of stopping here, when she may be perishing for hunger, like the poor lad in the parable.”","哦，别让我现在停下来，她可能因为饥饿而正在消亡，就像寓言故事中的那个可怜的孩子一样。”"
"And now she lifted up her voice, and wept aloud.","说到这里，她抬高声音，大声地哭了起来。"
"Will was deeply grieved.","威尔感到悲痛欲绝。"
"He had been old enough to be told the family shame when, more than two years before, his father had had his letter to his daughter returned by her mistress in Manchester, telling him that Lizzie had left her service some time—and why.","早在两年多前，他的年纪已经足够大，足以被告知他们家族的耻辱了，那时他父亲收到女儿在曼彻斯特的女教师寄回来的一封信，告知他莉齐已经离开了有一段时间——以及离开的原因。"
"He had sympathized with his father’s stern anger; though he had thought him something hard, it is true, when he had forbidden his weeping, heart-broken wife to go and try to find her poor sinning child, and declared that henceforth they would have no daughter; that she should be as one dead, and her name never more be named at market or at meal time, in blessing or in prayer.","他很理解父亲那种严峻的愤怒，尽管他认为他有点儿冷酷无情。这是真的，尤其当他禁止他悲伤欲绝的妻子去试图寻找她可怜的犯错的孩子，并且宣布自此以后他们不再有女儿，就当她已经死掉了，她的名字也不允许在市场或饭间，在祈福或祷告时提到。"
"He had held his peace, with compressed lips and contracted brow, when the neighbours had noticed to him how poor Lizzie’s death had aged both his father and his mother; and how they thought the bereaved couple would never hold up their heads again.","当邻居们告诉威尔，莉齐的去世使得他的父母变得多么苍老，以及他们如何认为这对遭受丧女之痛的夫妇再也无法振作起来时，他一直保持着沉默，双唇紧闭，眉头紧锁。"
"He himself had felt as if that one event had made him old before his time; and had envied Tom the tears he had shed over poor, pretty, innocent, dead Lizzie.","他自己也感觉到这次事件似乎使他看起来比他的年龄要成熟，于是他开始妒忌汤姆为不幸、美丽、天真、已逝的莉齐所洒落的泪水。"
"He thought about her sometimes, till he ground his teeth together, and could have struck her down in her shame.","他偶尔也会想起她，直到最后他紧咬牙关，将她击倒在她的耻辱当中。"
"His mother had never named her to him until now.","到目前为止，他的母亲从未在他面前提起过她。"
"“Mother!” said he, at last.","“妈妈！”他终于说道，"
"“She may be dead.","“她可能已经死掉了。"
"Most likely she is”","这是最可能的情况了。”"
"“No, Will; she is not dead,” said Mrs. Leigh.","“不，威尔，她没有死，”利太太说道，"
"“God will not let her die till I’ve seen her once again.","“在我再一次看到她之前，上帝不会让她死掉的。"
"Thou dost not know how I’ve prayed and prayed just once again to see her sweet face, and tell her I’ve forgiven her, though she’s broken my heart—she has, Will.”","你不知道有多少次我不停地祈祷着能再次看到她那甜美的面容，告诉她我已经原谅她了，尽管她曾经伤透了我的心——是曾经，威尔。”"
"She could not go on for a minute or two for the choking sobs.","她已经泣不成声，无法再继续下去。"
"“Thou dost not know that, or thou wouldst not say she could be dead—for God is very merciful, Will; He is: He is much more pitiful than man.","“你不了解，否则你不会说她可能已经死掉了——上帝是十分仁慈的，威尔，上帝比人类更具有同情心。"
"I could never ha’ spoken to thy father as I did to Him—and yet thy father forgave her at last.","我虽然无法像对上帝那样跟你的父亲谈话——但是你父亲最后也原谅了她。"
"The last words he said were that he forgave her.","他说的最后一句话是他原谅了她。"
"Thou’lt not be harder than thy father, Will?","你不会比你的父亲更冷酷吧，威尔？"
"Do not try and hinder me going to seek her, for it’s no use.”","不要试图阻挠我去寻找她，那样做是没用的。”"
"Will sat very still for a long time before he spoke.","威尔在说话之前，静静地坐了很久。"
"At last he said, “I’ll not hinder you.","最后他说：“我不会阻拦你的。"
"I think she’s dead, but that’s no matter.”","我认为她已经死掉了，但那无关紧要。”"
"“She’s not dead,” said her mother, with low earnestness.","“她没有死。”她母亲说道，声音不大，但却很诚挚。"
"Will took no notice of the interruption.","威尔没有理睬母亲的中途插话。"
"“We will all go to Manchester for a twelvemonth, and let the farm to Tom Higginbotham.","“我们全家都会去曼彻斯特呆上一年，然后把农场出租给汤姆·希金博特姆。"
"I’ll get blacksmith’s work; and Tom can have good schooling for awhile, which he’s always craving for.","我会找一份铁匠铺的工作，汤姆也可以受到一段时间的良好教育，这是他一直都渴望的。"
"At the end of the year you’ll come back, mother, and give over fretting for Lizzie, and think with me that she is dead—and, to my mind, that would be more comfort than to think of her living;” he dropped his voice as he spoke these last words.","到年底时，你要回来，妈妈，然后不再为莉齐的事情而抓狂，和我一样去想她已经死掉了——在我看来，这比认为她还活着要好受多了。”说到最后一句话时，他的声音低了下来。"
"She shook her head but made no answer.","她摇了摇头，但没有做出回答。"
"He asked again—“Will you, mother, agree to this?”","他再一次问道：“妈妈，你同意这样做吗？”"
"“I’ll agree to it a-this-ns,” said she.","“我同意，”她说道，"
"“If I hear and see nought of her for a twelvemonth, me being in Manchester looking out, I’ll just ha’ broken my heart fairly before the year’s ended, and then I shall know neither love nor sorrow for her any more, when I’m at rest in my grave.","“如果我用一年的时间在曼彻斯特都无法打听到她的踪影，那么在年底到来之前我的心就会碎掉了，那时我会躺在我的坟墓里，不再知道什么是爱，什么是悲伤。"
"I’ll agree to that, Will.”","我同意这种做法，威尔。”"
"“Well, I suppose it must be so.","“好吧，我认为必须是这样了。"
"I shall not tell Tom, mother, why we’re flitting to Manchester.","母亲，我不会告诉汤姆我们为什么要搬到曼彻斯特去的。"
"Best spare him.”","最好别让他知道这些。”"
"“As thou wilt,” said she, sadly, “so that we go, that’s all.”","“就按你想的做吧，”她悲伤地说道，“只要我们去那儿，就可以了。”"
"Before the wild daffodils were in flower in the sheltered copses round Upclose Farm, the Leighs were settled in their Manchester home; if they could ever grow to consider that place as a home, where there was no garden or outbuilding, no fresh breezy outlet, no far-stretching view, over moor and hollow; no dumb animals to be tended, and, what more than all they missed, no old haunting memories, even though those remembrances told of sorrow, and the dead and gone.","阿普克洛斯农场周围树阴下小灌木林中的野水仙尚未开花，利家人已经在他们曼彻斯特的家中安顿了下来；如果他们可以把这个地方当作家来看待，这里没有庭院或者其他附属建筑，没有空气清新、凉风习习的出口，没有沼泽和山谷上方绵延万里的风景；没有那些哑巴牲口需要喂养，并且，让他们所有人都想念的是这里没有过去那些令人难以忘怀的记忆，尽管这些记忆倾诉了太多的悲伤和已逝的亡人。"
"Mrs. Leigh heeded the loss of all these things less than her sons.","利太太并没有像她的两个儿子那样把这些东西的缺失看得那么重要。"
"She had more spirit in her countenance than she had had for months, because now she had hope; of a sad enough kind, to be sure, but still it was hope.","她脸上的气色比几个月前好多了，因为现在她有了希望，一种足够让人悲伤的希望，这点毋庸置疑，但终究是有了希望。"
"She performed all her household duties, strange and complicated as they were, and bewildered as she was with all the town necessities of her new manner of life; but when her house was “sided,” and the boys come home from their work in the evening, she would put on her things and steal out, unnoticed, as she thought, but not without many a heavy sigh from Will, after she had closed the house-door and departed.","她尽心尽责地履行她所有的家务职责，无论它们是多么陌生和麻烦，有时她也会对这种新的城镇生活方式的所有必需品感到困惑；但她还是在“整理”完家务之余，当孩子们晚上下班回家后，她会穿戴整齐，趁他们不注意时悄悄地溜出来，至少她是这么认为的，但她哪里知道在她扣上房门离开时伴随着的是威尔一声声沉重的叹息。"
"It was often past midnight before she came back, pale and weary, with almost a guilty look upon her face; but that face so full of disappointment and hope deferred, that Will had never the heart to say what he thought of the folly and hopelessness of the search.","通常是过了午夜后，她才面色苍白，疲惫不堪地回来，脸上几乎是带着一种负疚的表情；那张脸上写满了失落和希望耗尽的表情，以至于威尔无法鼓起勇气说出他对这种愚蠢、绝望的搜寻的看法"
"Night after night it was renewed, till days grew to weeks, and weeks to months.","夜复一夜，时间就这样流逝着，直到后来几个星期，几个月过去了。"
"All this time Will did his duty towards her as well as he could, without having sympathy with her.","在这段时间内，威尔一直在尽可能地恪守着他的职责，但却依旧无法认同他母亲的行为。"
"He stayed at home in the evenings for Tom’s sake, and often wished he had Tom’s pleasure in reading, for the time hung heavy on his hands as he sat up for his mother.","为了汤姆，他晚上得呆在家里。很多次在苦苦等待母亲归来的煎熬中，他多么希望自己能像汤姆那样快乐地读书。"
"I need not tell you how the mother spent the weary hours.","我本无需告诉你这位母亲是如何度过这段疲惫的时间的。"
"And yet I will tell you something.","但我还是会告诉你一些事情的。"
"She used to wander out, at first as if without a purpose, till she rallied her thoughts, and brought all her energies to bear on the one point; then she went with earnest patience along the least-known ways to some new part of the town, looking wistfully with dumb entreaty into people’s faces; sometimes catching a glimpse of a figure which had a kind of momentary likeness to her child’s, and following that figure with never-wearying perseverance, till some light from shop or lamp showed the cold strange face which was not her daughter’s.","她曾经在一开始漫无目的地游荡着，直到她重新整理了自己的思绪，将所有的精力都集中到一点上来；然后她带着诚挚的耐心，沿着那些没有人走的路到城中各种未知的地方，满怀渴望的目光中充满了无言的恳求，在人们的脸上搜寻着。有时在人群中瞥见的一个人影，有那么一瞬间像是她的孩子，她会以不知疲倦的毅力跟踪着人影，直到从商店或者路灯投射出来的光线显示那冰冷陌生的面庞并不属于她的女儿。"
"Once or twice a kind-hearted passer-by, struck by her look of yearning woe, turned back and offered help, or asked her what she wanted.","有那么一两次，某个好心的过路人不忍心看到她脸上那思念的伤痛，转过身来帮忙，或是问她需要什么。"
"When so spoken to, she answered only, “You don’t know a poor girl they call Lizzie Leigh, do you?” and when they denied all knowledge, she shook her head, and went on again.","每当她被问起的时候，她唯一的回答就是：“你认不认识一个叫莉齐·利的可怜女孩？”当人们说不认识的时候，她会摇摇头，继续寻找下去。"
"I think they believed her to be crazy.","我想他们肯定认为她疯掉了。"
"But she never spoke first to any one.","她从来不主动和任何人搭话。"
"She sometimes took a few minutes’ rest on the door-steps, and sometimes (very seldom) covered her face and cried; but she could not afford to lose time and chances in this way; while her eyes were blinded with tears, the lost one might pass by unseen.","她有时会坐在一些人家的门阶上休息几分钟，偶尔（很少）会捂着脸哭出声来；但是她浪费不起这样的时间和机会，她害怕在她掩面落泪的时候，她走失的女儿可能从旁边路过，而她却毫不知情。"
"One evening, in the rich time of shortening autumn-days, Will saw an old man, who, without being absolutely drunk, could not guide himself rightly along the foot-path, and was mocked for his unsteadiness of gait by the idle boys of the neighbourhood.","仲秋季节，白日渐短，就是在这样一个秋天的晚上，威尔遇到了一位老人，看上去并不像酩酊大醉的样子，却在行人道上找不到方向，他步履蹒跚的样子也招来了周边一群无所事事的孩子们的嘲笑。"
"For his father’s sake, Will regarded old age with tenderness, even when most degraded and removed from the stern virtues which dignified that father; so he took the old man home, and seemed to believe his often-repeated assertions, that he drank nothing but water.","因为父亲的缘故，威尔对老年人总是满怀着一股温情，即便眼前这位父亲身上本应体现的那些严肃的美德大部分已经退却丢失了，威尔还是把他送回了家，老人反复强调他喝的只是水，而威尔似乎也相信了这些说辞。"
"The stranger tried to stiffen himself up into steadiness as he drew nearer home, as if there some one there for whose respect he cared even in his half-intoxicated state, or whose feelings he feared to grieve.","快到家时，这位陌生的老人试图挺起身来走得稳当一些，好像即使是在这种半醉的状态下他这么做也是出于对家里那个他在乎的人的尊重，抑或他害怕会伤害到那个人的感情。"
"His home was exquisitely clean and neat, even in outside appearance; threshold, window, and windowsill were outward signs of some spirit of purity within.","即便从外表来看，他的家也是十分干净整洁，门槛、窗户和窗台这些外在的标志表示住在里面的人有着纯洁的思想。"
"Will was rewarded for his attention by a bright glance of thanks, succeeded by a blush of shame, from a young woman of twenty or thereabouts.","威尔的关注得到了奖赏，先是一瞥表示感谢的明亮目光，紧接着是一抹羞愧的脸红，来自一个二十岁左右的年轻女子。"
"She did not speak or second her father’s hospitable invitations to him to be seated.","她没有说话，也没有附和父亲的好客邀请他进来坐下。"
"She seemed unwilling that a stranger should witness her father’s attempts at stately sobriety, and Will could not bear to stay and see her distress.","她似乎不愿意让一个陌生人目睹父亲努力醒酒的样子，威尔也不忍心留在这里看着她苦恼。"
"But when the old man, with many a flabby shake of the hand, kept asking him to come again some other evening, and see them, Will sought her downcast eyes, and, though he could not read their veiled meaning, he answered, timidly, “If it’s agreeable to everybody, I’ll come, and thank ye.”","但是当老人多次孱弱地挥动着手臂，不停地邀请他择日再来拜访的时候，威尔瞄到了她低垂的目光，他无法读懂那背后隐藏的含义，但他还是怯生生地答道：“如果大家都高兴的话，我会来的，谢谢你。”"
"But there was no answer from the girl, to whom this speech was in reality addressed; and Will left the house, liking her all the better for never speaking.","威尔这番话实际上是冲着女孩讲的，但却没有收到任何答复；于是威尔离开了，并且因为她的沉默而对她更加青睐。"
"He thought about her a great deal for the next day or two; he scolded himself for being so foolish as to think of her, and then fell to with fresh vigour, and thought of her more than ever.","接下来的一两天，他满脑子想的都是她，他甚至为此而责骂自己是多么愚蠢，然后抖擞一下精神，却发现更加想念她了。"
"He tried to depreciate her: he told himself she was not pretty, and then made indignant answer that he liked her looks much better than any beauty of them all.","他试着贬低她：告诉自己她不算漂亮，然后得出的令人愤怒的答案是在她所有的美丽中，他最喜欢的就是她的容貌。"
"He wished he was not so country-looking, so red-faced, so broad-shouldered; while she was like a lady, with her smooth, colourless complexion, her bright dark hair, and her spotless dress.","他希望自己看起来不是那么土气，面色那么酡红，肩膀那么宽阔，而她则是一个淑女，有着光滑、洁白的皮肤，黝黑闪亮的秀发，身上的裙子也一尘不染。"
"Pretty or not pretty she drew his footsteps towards her; he could not resist the impulse that made him wish to see her once more, and find out some fault which should unloose his heart from her unconscious keeping.","不论漂亮与否，她都吸引着她，他无法抵御想再一次见到她的冲动，甚至找不到任何错误来摆脱内心对她的牵绊。"
"But there she was, pure and maidenly as before.","但她还是那个样子，像之前一样纯洁无瑕，静如处子。"
"He sat and looked, answering her father at cross-purposes, while she drew more and more into the shadow of the chimney-corner out of sight.","他坐在那里，望着她，前言不搭后语地回答着她父亲的问题，而她则逐渐退却到了烟囱角落的阴影里，他再也看不到她。"
"Then the spirit that possessed him (it was not he himself, sure, that did so impudent a thing!) made him get up and carry the candle to a different place, under the pretence of giving her more light at her sewing, but in reality to be able to see her better.","突然他仿佛被幽灵附体了一般（可以肯定，他本人是绝不会做出如此鲁莽的事情的）站起来，把蜡烛挪了一个地方，假装是让她在更好的光线下做针线活，实则是为了能更好地看着她。"
"She could not stand this much longer, but jumped up and said she must put her little niece to bed; and surely there never was, before or since, so troublesome a child of two years old, for though Will stayed an hour and a half longer, she never came down again.","她再也无法忍受这些行为，站起来说必须要去哄她的小外甥女入睡；当然，威尔从未，以后也不会，见到如此麻烦的两岁的孩子，因为接下来威尔又多呆了一个半小时，但她再也没有下楼来。"
"He won the father’s heart, though, by his capacity as a listener; for some people are not at all particular, and, so that they themselves may talk on undisturbed, are not so unreasonable as to expect attention to what they say.","尽管如此，他还是作为一个好听众赢得了她父亲的心，因为有些人对听众并不是很挑剔，只要他们能自顾自地不受干扰地讲话，他们才不管你有没有听呢。"
"Will did gather this much, however, from the old man’s talk.","但是，威尔还是多少从老人的话中了解到了一些东西。"
"He had once been quite in a genteel line of business, but had failed for more money than any greengrocer he had heard of; at least, any who did not mix up fish and game with green-grocery proper.","他曾经有过非常体面的职业，但是干得一塌糊涂，甚至还没有菜贩子挣得多，至少没有那些懂得把鱼和野味与绿色产品分开来卖的小贩挣得多。"
"This grand failure seemed to have been the event of his life, and one on which he dwelt with a strange kind of pride.","这个不小的失败似乎成了他人生中的壮举，他也因此产生了一种奇怪的自豪感。"
"It appeared as if at present he rested from his past exertions (in the bankrupt line), and depended on his daughter, who kept a small school for very young children.","现在的他似乎还驻留在过去的挣扎中（破产的经历），全靠女儿开的一所为孩子开放的学校来维持生计。"
"But all these particulars Will only remembered and understood when he had left the house; at the time he heard them, he was thinking of Susan.","威尔离开时只记得这些情况了，他在听到这些话的时候，满脑子想的都是苏珊。"
"After he had made good his footing at Mr. Palmer’s, he was not long, you may be sure, without finding some reason for returning again and again.","你可能已经猜到了，在与帕尔默先生处好关系后，他总是隔不多久就会找一些借口来频繁造访。"
"He listened to her father, he talked to the little niece, but he looked at Susan, both while he listened and while he talked.","他会听她父亲高谈阔论，也会和她的小侄女说话，但不管是在听或者讲的时候，他总是盯着苏珊。"
"Her father kept on insisting upon his former gentility, the details of which would have appeared very questionable to Will’s mind, if the sweet, delicate, modest Susan had not thrown an inexplicable air of refinement over all she came near.","她的父亲不停地强调他以前的高贵风光，若不是被温柔、娇弱、端庄的苏珊所带来的那种难以名状的高贵气质所影响，威尔会发现她父亲话语的细节中有很多可疑之处。"
"She never spoke much; she was generally diligently at work; but when she moved it was so noiselessly, and when she did speak, it was in so low and soft a voice, that silence, speech, motion, and stillness alike seemed to remove her high above Will’s reach into some saintly and inaccessible air of glory—high above his reach, even as she knew him!","她从来不多说话，总是在勤快地干活，走起来也悄无声息，但是当她开口说话时，她的声音是如此低沉和温柔，以至于她无论是沉默还是讲话，无论是行走还是静止，都带着一股圣洁的难以企及的荣耀气息，远远超出了他的触及范围，即便是她认识他！"
"And, if she were made acquainted with the dark secret behind of his sister’s shame, which was kept ever present to his mind by his mother’s nightly search among the outcast and forsaken, would not Susan shrink away from him with loathing, as if he were tainted by the involuntary relationship?","母亲晚上在那些被驱除和抛弃人群中的搜寻让他心里一直犯嘀咕，如果苏珊知道了背后他妹妹的耻辱秘密，她会不会从他身边嫌恶地逃开，仿佛他也被这段非自愿的关系所污染了？"
"This was his dread; and thereupon followed a resolution that he would withdraw from her sweet company before it was too late.","这让他感到害怕，因此他决定在一切都不算太晚之前，从她那温柔的身边逃离。"
"So he resisted internal temptation, and stayed at home, and suffered and sighed.","于是他抵御着内心的诱惑，呆在了家中，备受煎熬，叹声连连。"
"He became angry with his mother for her untiring patience in seeking for one who he could not help hoping was dead rather than alive.","他迁怒于他的母亲，愤恨她那不知疲倦的耐心去寻找一个他禁不住希望已经死掉了的人。"
"He spoke sharply to her, and received only such sad deprecatory answers as made him reproach himself, and still more lose sight of peace of mind.","他对母亲的话语开始尖锐，母亲伤心歉意的回答只会让他责备自己，内心更加不平静。"
"This struggle could not last long without affecting his health; and Tom, his sole companion through the long evenings, noticed his increasing languor, his restless irritability, with perplexed anxiety, and at last resolved to call his mother’s attention to his brother’s haggard, careworn looks.","这种煎熬不久就影响到了他的健康；而汤姆，他在漫长夜晚里唯一的同伴，也注意到了他与日俱增的倦怠与烦躁不安，焦急而不知所措的汤姆最终提醒母亲，使她注意到了哥哥憔悴、疲倦的容貌。"
"She listened with a startled recollection of Will’s claims upon her love.","她在聆听的时候突然想起了威尔针对她走失的爱女的一些断言。"
"She noticed his decreasing appetite and half-checked sighs.","她注意到他日渐消退的食欲以及断断续续的叹气声。"
"“Will, lad! what’s come o’er thee?” said she to him, as he sat listlessly gazing into the fire.","“威尔，我的孩子！你怎么了？”她问道，他坐在那里无精打采的，眼睛凝视着火炉。"
"“There’s nought the matter with me,” said he, as if annoyed at her remark.","“我一点儿事都没有。”他答道，似乎对她的询问感到愠怒。"
"“Nay, lad, but there is.”","“不，孩子，你肯定有事。”"
"He did not speak again to contradict her; indeed, she did not know if he had heard her, so unmoved did he look.","他没有再说话来反驳她，事实上，她不知道他是否听到了她的话，他是那么无动于衷。"
"“Wouldst like to go to Upclose Farm?” asked she, sorrowfully.","“你是不是想回阿普克洛斯农场了？”她伤心地问道。"
"“It’s just blackberrying time,” said Tom.","“现在是黑莓采摘的季节。”汤姆说道。"
"Will shook his head.","威尔摇了摇头。"
"She looked at him awhile, as if trying to read that expression of despondency, and trace it back to its source.","她盯着他看了一会儿，仿佛在努力地去读懂那种失望的表情，找到它的源头所在。"
"“Will and Tom could go,” said she; “I must stay here till I’ve found her, thou knowest,” continued she, dropping her voice.","“你和汤姆可以回去，”她说道，“我得留下直到找到她，你们知道的。”她继续道，声音低了下来。"
"He turned quickly round, and with the authority he at all times exercised over Tom, bade him begone to bed.","威尔快速地转过身来，以他一直以来在汤姆面前的威信，命令他去上床睡觉。"
"When Tom had left the room, he prepared to speak.","汤姆离开房间后，他才准备开口。"

"CHAPTER II.","第二章"
"“Mother,” then said Will, “why will you keep on thinking she’s alive?","“妈妈，”威尔说道，“你为什么坚持认为她还活着？"
"If she were but dead, we need never name her name again.","如果她已经死了，我们就没有必要再提起她的名字了。"
"We’ve never heard nought on her since father wrote her that letter; we never knew whether she got it or not.","自从父亲写给她那封信后，我们就再也没有她的音讯；我们甚至永远都不知道她是否收到了信。"
"She’d left her place before then.","她在那之前就已经离开了。"
"Many a one dies in—”","多半也已经死——”"
"“Oh, my lad! dunnot speak so to me, or my heart will break outright,” said his mother, with a sort of cry.","“哦，我的孩子！别这样对我说，我的心会彻底破碎的。”他母亲带着哭声说道。"
"Then she calmed herself, for she yearned to persuade him to her own belief.","然后她平静了下来，因为她希望能劝说他相信她的信念。"
"“Thou never asked, and thou’rt too like thy father for me to tell without asking—but it were all to be near Lizzie’s old place that I settled down on this side o’ Manchester; and the very day at after we came, I went to her old missus, and asked to speak a word wi’ her.","“你从来都不过问，这点跟你的父亲太相似，每次都是我告诉你们而不是你们来问——我之所以在曼彻斯特这边住下来就是为了能靠近莉齐曾经呆过的地方；我们搬过来后仅仅第二天，我就去找过她的房东老嬷嬷，想问她一些事情。"
"I had a strong mind to cast it up to her, that she should ha’ sent my poor lass away, without telling on it to us first; but she were in black, and looked so sad I could na’ find in my heart to threep it up.","我有一种强烈的感觉，就是她，在没有告知我们的情况下，便把我那可怜的女儿打发走了；只是她一身黑衣，看上去那么伤心，我不忍心再让她遭罪。"
"But I did ask her a bit about our Lizzie.","但我还是向她询问了一些关于我们的莉齐的事情。"
"The master would have turned her away at a day’s warning (he’s gone to t’other place; I hope he’ll meet wi’ more mercy there than he showed our Lizzie—I do), and when the missus asked her should she write to us, she says Lizzie shook her head; and when she speered at her again, the poor lass went down on her knees, and begged her not, for she said it would break my heart (as it has done, Will—God knows it has),” said the poor mother, choking with her struggle to keep down her hard overmastering grief, “and her father would curse her—Oh, God, teach me to be patient.”","院长本来打算在一天的惩戒后就把她打发走的（他已经不在这儿了；我希望他能遇到更多的宽容，而不像他对我们的莉齐那样——我是真心的），当老嬷嬷问她是否应该给我们写封信时，莉齐摇了摇头；而当她再次询问时，我可怜的孩子跪下来请求她不要这样，说那样会让我心碎的（我的心已经碎了，威尔——上帝知道的），”这可怜的母亲哽咽着，努力控制住她内心强烈的悲痛，“而她的父亲会咒骂她——哦，上帝，教我学会忍耐吧。”"
"She could not speak for a few minutes—“and the lass threatened, and said she’d go drown herself in the canal, if the missus wrote home—and so—","几分钟后，她才得以继续说道：“这可怜的女孩被吓坏了，说如果嬷嬷写信告知她家人的话，她就去跳河淹死算了——于是就——”"
"“Well!","“还好！"
"I’d got a trace of my child—the missus thought she’d gone to th’ workhouse to be nursed; and there I went—and there, sure enough, she had been—and they’d turned her out as she were strong, and told her she were young enough to work—but whatten kind o’ work would be open to her, lad, and her baby to keep?”","我找到了我孩子的一些踪迹——嬷嬷认为她可能去了感化院寻求庇护；于是我就去了——我确信她曾经去过那儿——他们把她赶走了，因为她很强壮，并且说她还年轻，可以找份活干——可是她能找到什么样的活，我的孩子，来养活她自己和她的孩子？”"
"Will listened to his mother’s tale with deep sympathy, not unmixed with the old bitter shame.","威尔聆听着母亲的诉说，不禁感同身受，深表同情，再混杂着之前那种苦涩的耻辱感，心中更是别有一番滋味。"
"But the opening of her heart had unlocked his, and after awhile he spoke—","母亲的敞开心扉也让他打开了自己的心房，过了一会儿，他说道："
"“Mother!","“妈妈！"
"I think I’d e’en better go home.","我想我最好还是回家吧。"
"Tom can stay wi’ thee.","汤姆可以在这儿陪着你。"
"I know I should stay too, but I cannot stay in peace so near—her—without craving to see her—Susan Palmer, I mean.”","我知道我也应该留下来，可是呆在这儿，距离——她——如此之近，却又不能渴望见到她——苏珊·帕尔默，我无法平静下来。”"
"“Has the old Mr. Palmer thou telled me on a daughter?” asked Mrs. Leigh.","“你跟我提过的那位帕尔默老先生有个女儿？”利太太问道。"
"“Ay, he has.","“是，他有个女儿。"
"And I love her above a bit.","我很爱她。"
"And it’s because I love her I want to leave Manchester.","正因为爱她，我才想离开曼彻斯特。"
"That’s all.”","就这样。”"
"Mrs. Leigh tried to understand this speech for some time, but found it difficult of interpretation.","利太太花了一段时间努力想搞懂他的意思，发现很难理解。"
"“Why shouldst thou not tell her thou lov’st her?","“你为什么不告诉她你爱她呢？"
"Thou’rt a likely lad, and sure o’ work.","你是一个有前途的青年，你的工作也是。"
"Thou’lt have Upclose at my death; and as for that, I could let thee have it now, and keep mysel’ by doing a bit of charring.","你会在我死后继承阿普克洛斯农场；关于这一点，我现在就可以把它给你，我留下来做些杂活就行了。"
"It seems to me a very backwards sort o’ way of winning her to think of leaving Manchester.”","在我看来，要赢取她的芳心，离开曼彻斯特是一个南辕北辙的做法。”"
"“Oh, mother, she’s so gentle and so good—she’s downright holy.","“哦，妈妈，她是那么温柔，那么善良——她简直就是圣洁的化身。"
"She’s never known a touch of sin; and can I ask her to marry me, knowing what we do about Lizzie, and fearing worse?","她对罪恶一无所知；而我又怎能在知道我们为莉齐所做的事情，并且担心会有更糟糕的结果出现的情况下恳求她嫁给我？"
"I doubt if one like her could ever care for me; but if she knew about my sister, it would put a gulf between us, and she’d shudder up at the thought of crossing it.","我怀疑她那样优秀的人是否会在意我；但是如果她知道了我妹妹的事情，那将在我们之间横亘一条海峡，仅仅是横渡海峡的这个想法就会使她不寒而栗。"
"You don’t know how good she is, mother!”","你不知道她有多好，妈妈！”"
"“Will, Will! if she’s so good as thou say’st, she’ll have pity on such as my Lizzie.","“威尔，威尔！如果她果真如你说的那般好，她会同情和莉齐一样遭遇的人们的。"
"If she has no pity for such, she’s a cruel Pharisee, and thou’rt best without her.”","如果她没有这样的同情心，那她就是一个冷酷的伪善者，你也最好离她远远的。”"
"But he only shook his head, and sighed; and for the time the conversation dropped.","但他只是摇摇头，叹了口气；他们之间的谈话也到此为止。"
"But a new idea sprang up in Mrs. Leigh’s head.","不过利太太脑中又生出来一个新主意。"
"She thought that she would go and see Susan Palmer, and speak up for Will, and tell her the truth about Lizzie; and according to her pity for the poor sinner, would she be worthy or unworthy of him.","她想要亲自去看看苏珊·帕尔默，帮威尔说几句话，并且告诉她关于莉齐的真实情况；然后根据她对那个可怜的罪人的同情心，看看她值不值得威尔去追求。"
"She resolved to go the very next afternoon, but without telling any one of her plan.","她决定第二天下午就过去，但没有把她的计划告诉任何人。"
"Accordingly she looked out the Sunday clothes she had never before had the heart to unpack since she came to Manchester, but which she now desired to appear in, in order to do credit to Will.","因此她找出了她最好的衣服，自从来到曼彻斯特之后，她一直都没有心情来打开它们，但是现在为了能给威尔脸上增光，她愿意穿上这些衣服。"
"She put on her old-fashioned black mode bonnet, trimmed with real lace; her scarlet cloth cloak, which she had had ever since she was married; and, always spotlessly clean, she set forth on her unauthorised embassy.","她戴上了那顶旧式的蕾丝饰边的黑色女帽；披上了那件她只在结婚时穿过的鲜红色斗篷；一如既往地收拾得一尘不染，然后启程奔赴她那未被授权的使命。"
"She knew the Palmers lived in Crown Street, though where she had heard it she could not tell; and modestly asking her way, she arrived in the street about a quarter to four o’clock.","她知道帕尔默一家住在克朗街上，她听说过这个地方，但却不知道在哪里；于是便谦逊地向人们问路，在大约四点一刻的时候她来到了这条街道上。"
"She stopped to enquire the exact number, and the woman whom she addressed told her that Susan Palmer’s school would not be loosed till four, and asked her to step in and wait until then at her house.","她停下来打听具体的门牌号，她问话的那个女人告诉她，苏珊·帕尔默的学校到四点才会下课，并且请她进来等着她回家。"
"“For,” said she, smiling, “them that wants Susan Palmer wants a kind friend of ours; so we, in a manner, call cousins.","“因为，”她微笑着说，“苏珊的朋友就是我们的好朋友；因为，在某种程度上，我们以表姐妹相称。"
"Sit down, missus, sit down.","请坐，太太，请坐。"
"I’ll wipe the chair, so that it shanna dirty your cloak.","我来擦椅子，这样就不会弄脏你的斗篷。"
"My mother used to wear them bright cloaks, and they’re right gradely things again a green field.”","我母亲过去喜欢穿鲜亮的斗篷，它们在绿色田野的衬映下非常漂亮。”"
"“Han ye known Susan Palmer long?” asked Mrs. Leigh, pleased with the admiration of her cloak.","“你认识苏珊·帕尔默很久了吗？”利太太问道，对她的斗篷的赞赏，让她感到很高兴。"
"“Ever since they comed to live in our street.","“从他们搬来住到我们街上就认识了。"
"Our Sally goes to her school.”","我们的萨莉在她的学校上学。”"
"“Whatten sort of a lass is she, for I ha’ never seen her?”","“我从来没有见过她，她是个怎样的女孩子？”"
"“Well, as for looks, I cannot say.","“嗯，关于长相嘛，我说不准。"
"It’s so long since I first knowed her, that I’ve clean forgotten what I thought of her then.","第一次认识她到现在已经很久了，我完全忘记当时是怎么看待她的了。"
"My master says he never saw such a smile for gladdening the heart.","我的主人说他从未见过那样能让人满心喜悦的笑容。"
"But maybe it’s not looks you’re asking about.","但也许你想知道的并不是她的容貌。"
"The best thing I can say of her looks is, that she’s just one a stranger would stop in the street to ask help from if he needed it.","关于她的容貌，我能说的最好的事情是，她就是那种连陌生人在需要帮助时都会在大街上停下来向她求助的人。"
"All the little childer creeps as close as they can to her; she’ll have as many as three or four hanging to her apron all at once.”","所有的小孩子都会尽可能地爬着靠近她；有时一下子会有多达三四个孩子扑到她的围裙上。”"
"“Is she cocket at all?”","“她粗俗吗？”"
"“Cocket, bless you! you never saw a creature less set up in all your life.","“粗俗，托上帝的福！你一生中都不会再遇到比她还得体的人了。"
"Her father’s cocket enough.","她父亲倒是十足的粗俗。"
"No! she’s not cocket any way.","但她不是！她一点儿也不粗俗。"
"You’ve not heard much of Susan Palmer, I reckon, if you think she’s cocket.","如果你认为她粗俗的话，我想，那是你对她的了解不够多。"
"She’s just one to come quietly in, and do the very thing most wanted; little things, maybe, that any one could do, but that few would think on, for another.","她会安静地走进来，把最需要做的事情完成；可能是一些任何人都能做的琐碎事情，但是很少有人会在做的时候替别人着想。"
"She’ll bring her thimble wi’ her, and mend up after the childer o’ nights; and she writes all Betty Harker’s letters to her grandchild out at service; and she’s in nobody’s way, and that’s a great matter, I take it.","她会随身带着顶针，在晚上孩子们睡着后替他们缝补衣服；所有贝蒂·哈克写给孙子的信都是她代劳的；她从来不妨碍别人做事，这点我认为很伟大。"
"Here’s the childer running past!","孩子们跑过来了！"
"School is loosed.","放学了。"
"You’ll find her now, missus, ready to hear and to help.","太太，你现在可以去找她了，她会很乐意听您说话和帮您的。"
"But we none on us frab her by going near her in school-time.”","但是我们都不敢在上课的时候靠近打扰她。”"
"Poor Mrs. Leigh’s heart began to beat, and she could almost have turned round and gone home again.","可怜的利太太，她的心脏开始狂跳，差点儿就要转身回家了。"
"Her country breeding had made her shy of strangers, and this Susan Palmer appeared to her like a real born lady by all accounts.","在乡下长大使她在陌生人面前很害羞，而这位苏珊·帕尔默对她而言恰恰就是一位众所周知的天生淑女。"
"So she knocked with a timid feeling at the indicated door, and when it was opened, dropped a simple curtsey without speaking.","因此，她怀着忐忑不安的心情她叩响了那家指定的房门，当房门打开时，她没有说话，只是行了个简单的屈膝礼。"
"Susan had her little niece in her arms, curled up with fond endearment against her breast, but she put her gently down to the ground, and instantly placed a chair in the best corner of the room for Mrs. Leigh, when she told her who she was.","苏珊怀抱着她的小外甥女，孩子满怀爱意地蜷伏在她的胸前，当利太太说明身份时，她轻轻地把孩子放到地上，很快在房间最好的角落为利太太摆上一张椅子。"
"“It’s not Will as has asked me to come,” said the mother, apologetically; “I’d a wish just to speak to you myself!”","“不是威尔让我来的，”这位母亲带着歉意说道，“我希望能和你亲自聊一聊！”"
"Susan coloured up to her temples, and stooped to pick up the little toddling girl.","苏珊的脸一下子红到了双鬓，她弯腰抱起了蹒跚学步的小女孩。"
"In a minute or two Mrs. Leigh began again.","大约过了一两分钟，利太太再次开口了。"
"“Will thinks you would na respect us if you knew all; but I think you could na help feeling for us in the sorrow God has put upon us; so I just put on my bonnet, and came off unknownst to the lads.","“威尔认为如果你知道了全部事情，你就不会再尊重我们；但是我认为你会跟上帝一样忍不住同情我们的悲伤的；于是我就戴上了我的帽子，在孩子们不知情的情况下来了。"
"Every one says you’re very good, and that the Lord has keeped you from falling from His ways; but maybe you’ve never yet been tried and tempted as some is.","每个人都对你交口称赞，说上帝会保佑你不会偏离他的指引；但是可能你从未像有些人那样遭受过磨难和诱惑。"
"I’m perhaps speaking too plain, but my heart’s welly broken, and I can’t be choice in my words as them who are happy can.","我可能说得过于直白了，但是我的心已经碎了，我不能像那些快乐的人一样挑选我的用词。"
"Well now!","好啦！"
"I’ll tell you the truth.","我还是跟你说实话吧。"
"Will dreads you to hear it, but I’ll just tell it you.","威尔害怕你听到实话，但是我会告诉你的。"
"You mun know—” but here the poor woman’s words failed her, and she could do nothing but sit rocking herself backwards and forwards, with sad eyes, straight-gazing into Susan’s face, as if they tried to tell the tale of agony which the quivering lips refused to utter.","你必须要知道——”话到这里，这个可怜的女人再也说不下去了，她唯一能做的就是坐在那里前后摇摆，哀伤的双眼直直凝视着苏珊的脸庞，似乎它们在试图倾诉她那颤抖的双唇拒绝表达的痛苦往事。"
"Those wretched, stony eyes forced the tears down Susan’s cheeks, and, as if this sympathy gave the mother strength, she went on in a low voice—“I had a daughter once, my heart’s darling.","那可怜、无神的双眼迫使泪水沿着苏珊的脸颊滚落，仿佛这种同情给了这位母亲力量，她低声继续说道：“我曾经有一个女儿，是我的小心肝。"
"Her father thought I made too much on her, and that she’d grow marred staying at home; so he said she mun go among strangers and learn to rough it.","她的父亲认为我太宠爱她了，呆在家中会被毁掉的；于是他说她必须到陌生人当中学会磨炼自己。"
"She were young, and liked the thought of seeing a bit of the world; and her father heard on a place in Manchester.","她那时还小，对去外面世界看看的想法也很热衷，她的父亲听说曼彻斯特有这么一个地方。"
"Well!","好吧！"
"I’ll not weary you.","我不会使你厌倦的。"
"That poor girl were led astray; and first thing we heard on it, was when a letter of her father’s was sent back by her missus, saying she’d left her place, or, to speak right, the master had turned her into the street soon as he had heard of her condition—and she not seventeen!”","那可怜的女孩被引入歧途了；我们所听到第一件事情，是他父亲写的一封信被她的嬷嬷退了回来，说她已经离开了，或者准确地说，是院长在听说了她的事情后把她赶到了大街上——她还不到十七岁！”"
"She now cried aloud; and Susan wept too.","她大声哭了起来，苏珊也禁不住潸然泪下。"
"The little child looked up into their faces, and, catching their sorrow, began to whimper and wail.","小女孩抬头望着她们的面容，捕捉到了她们表情里的悲伤，也开始哭哭啼啼。"
"Susan took it softly up, and hiding her face in its little neck, tried to restrain her tears, and think of comfort for the mother.","苏珊轻轻地把她抱了起来，把脸埋在孩子瘦小的脖子里，努力控制住泪水，开始想办法安慰这位伤心的母亲。"
"At last she said—","最后她说道："
"“Where is she now?”","“她现在在哪儿呢？”"
"“Lass!","“姑娘！"
"I dunnot know,” said Mrs. Leigh, checking her sobs to communicate this addition to her distress.","我不知道，”利太太说，努力不让啜泣声再增加她的悲伤，"
"“Mrs. Lomax telled me she went—”","“洛马克斯太太告诉我她去了——”"
"“Mrs. Lomax—what Mrs. Lomax?”","“洛马克斯太太——哪个洛马克思太太？”"
"“Her as lives in Brabazon Street.","“她住在布拉巴宗街。"
"She telled me my poor wench went to the workhouse fra there.","她告诉我我那可怜的乡下姑娘去了感化院。"
"I’ll not speak again the dead; but if her father would but ha’ letten me—but he were one who had no notion—no, I’ll not say that; best say nought.","我不能亵渎逝者，但如果她的父亲当初肯让我——可是他当时没有一丁点儿这样的意图——不，我不说了，最好什么也不说了。"
"He forgave her on his death-bed.","他临终时原谅了她。"
"I daresay I did na go th’ right way to work.”","我敢说是我没有用对方法。”"
"“Will you hold the child for me one instant?” said Susan.","“你能帮我抱一下孩子吗？”苏珊说道。"
"“Ay, if it will come to me.","“好的，如果她肯让我抱的话。"
"Childer used to be fond on me till I got the sad look on my face that scares them, I think.”","孩子们过去很喜欢我的，直到我脸上有了这副悲伤的表情，我想孩子们被这表情吓坏了。”"
"But the little girl clung to Susan; so she carried it upstairs with her.","可是小女孩紧紧抱住苏珊不放，于是她抱着她上楼去了。"
"Mrs. Leigh sat by herself—how long she did not know.","利太太一个人坐着——坐了多久她也不知道。"
"Susan came down with a bundle of far-worn baby-clothes.","苏珊下来时拿着一包非常破旧的婴儿衣服。"
"“You must listen to me a bit, and not think too much about what I’m going to tell you.","“你一定要听我说，但是对我接下来要说的话别想太多。"
"Nanny is not my niece, nor any kin to me, that I know of.","南妮不是我的外甥女，也不是任何我所认识的亲戚。"
"I used to go out working by the day.","我过去一直在白天出去工作。"
"One night, as I came home, I thought some woman was following me; I turned to look.","一天夜晚，当我回家时，我感到有个女人在跟踪我，于是回头看去。"
"The woman, before I could see her face (for she turned it to one side), offered me something.","我还没来得及看清她的脸（因为她把脸转向了一边），这个女人塞给了我一样东西。"
"I held out my arms by instinct; she dropped a bundle into them, with a bursting sob that went straight to my heart.","我本能地伸开双臂，她丢下了一个包裹，伴随着一声撕心裂肺的啜泣震撼着我的内心。"
"It was a baby.","是一个婴儿。"
"I looked round again; but the woman was gone.","我再次环顾四周，已经不见了那个女人。"
"She had run away as quick as lightning.","她逃走的速度如闪电一般。"
"There was a little packet of clothes—very few—and as if they were made out of its mother’s gowns, for they were large patterns to buy for a baby.","有一小包衣服——没几件——看上去好像是从孩子母亲的长袍改造过来的，因为上面图案的格局对于婴儿来说过大了。"
"I was always fond of babies; and I had not my wits about me, father says; for it was very cold, and when I’d seen as well as I could (for it was past ten) that there was no one in the street, I brought it in and warmed it.","我一直都很喜欢婴儿；父亲说我没什么警惕性；当时天很冷，所以当我确信大街上看不到一个人影时（当时已经过了十点），我把婴儿抱回了家并且给她取暖。"
"Father was very angry when he came, and said he’d take it to the workhouse the next morning, and flyted me sadly about it.","父亲回来后非常愤怒，声称第二天早上他会把孩子送到感化院去，吵得我也对这个孩子感到很伤心。"
"But when morning came I could not bear to part with it; it had slept in my arms all night; and I’ve heard what workhouse bringing-up is.","但是到了早上的时候，我不忍心与她分离；她在我的臂弯里睡了整整一夜；并且我听说过感化院的养育方式是什么样的。"
"So I told father I’d give up going out working and stay at home and keep school, if I might only keep the baby; and, after a while, he said if I earned enough for him to have his comforts, he’d let me; but he’s never taken to her.","因此我告诉父亲只要我能留下这个婴儿，我将不再出去工作，而是呆在家中办好学校；过了一会儿，他说如果我挣足够的钱供他消遣，他会同意的；但是他从未对她有过好感。"
"Now, don’t tremble so—I’ve but a little more to tell—and maybe I’m wrong in telling it; but I used to work next door to Mrs. Lomax’s, in Brabazon Street, and the servants were all thick together; and I heard about Bessy (they called her) being sent away.","唉，别颤抖得这么——我还有一些话要说——可能我不该说出来；我过去曾经在布拉巴宗街上洛马克思太太的隔壁工作，所有的仆人们都处得很好；我听说贝西（他们这么叫她）被赶走了。"
"I don’t know that ever I saw her; but the time would be about fitting to this child’s age, and I’ve sometimes fancied it was hers.","我不知道我是否见过她，但是那个时间和这个孩子的年龄是大致相符的，有时候我会猜想这是她的孩子。"
"And now, will you look at the little clothes that came with her—bless her!”","现在，你要不要看看和她一起送来的这些小孩衣服——上帝保佑她！”"
"But Mrs. Leigh had fainted.","可是利太太已经晕了过去。"
"The strange joy and shame, and gushing love for the little child, had overpowered her; it was some time before Susan could bring her round.","这种怪异的喜悦和羞愧，以及对这个孩子喷薄欲出的爱意，已经压倒了她；过了一段时间，苏珊才把她唤醒过来。"
"There she was all trembling, sick with impatience to look at the little frocks.","她浑身发抖，心急火燎，迫不及待地要看那些小孩子的衣服。"
"Among them was a slip of paper which Susan had forgotten to name, that had been pinned to the bundle.","衣服里有一张纸条钉在包裹上，苏珊给孩子起名的时候把这张纸条给忘记了。"
"On it was scrawled in a round stiff hand—","纸条上以僵硬的巨大手写体潦草地写着——"
"“Call her Anne.","“她的名字是安妮。"
"She does not cry much, and takes a deal of notice.","她不怎么爱哭，很喜欢观察。"
"God bless you and forgive me.”","愿上帝保佑你，原谅我。”"
"The writing was no clue at all; the name “Anne,” common though it was, seemed something to build upon.","文字里没有一点儿线索，“安妮”这个名字虽然普通，但似乎是建立在某些东西上面。"
"But Mrs. Leigh recognised one of the frocks instantly, as being made out of a part of a gown that she and her daughter had bought together in Rochdale.","不过利太太马上就认出了其中的一件罩袍，是从她和女儿一起在罗奇达尔买的一件礼服的一部分改做而来。"
"She stood up, and stretched out her hands in the attitude of blessing over Susan’s bent head.","她站了起来，伸出双手放在苏珊低垂下来的头上为她祈福。"
"“God bless you, and show you His mercy in your need, as you have shown it to this little child.”","“上帝保佑你，他会在你需要的时候向你展示他的仁慈，正如你向这个孩子展示的那样。”"
"She took the little creature in her arms, and smoothed away her sad looks to a smile, and kissed it fondly, saying over and over again, “Nanny, Nanny, my little Nanny.”","她把这个小家伙抱在怀里，脸上的悲伤表情逐渐消散，取而代之的是一个笑脸，她温柔地亲吻着这个小家伙，一遍又一遍地喊着，“南妮，南妮，我的小南妮。”"
"At last the child was soothed, and looked in her face and smiled back again.","终于小家伙被哄得安静了下来，盯着她的脸看，冲着她笑。"
"“It has her eyes,” said she to Susan.","“她的眼睛很像她。”利太太对苏珊说。"
"“I never saw her to the best of my knowledge.","“我可以肯定我根本没看到过她。"
"I think it must be hers by the frock.","我是从这件罩袍想到孩子肯定是她的。"
"But where can she be?”","但是现在她能在哪儿呢？”"
"“God knows,” said Mrs. Leigh; “I dare not think she’s dead.","“天晓得啊，”利太太说，“我不敢想象她已经死了。"
"I’m sure she isn’t.”","我肯定她没有死。”"
"“No; she’s not dead.","“不。她没有死。"
"Every now and then a little packet is thrust in under our door, with, may be, two half-crowns in it; once it was half-a-sovereign.","“时不时会有一个小包裹塞到我们家门下面，里面可能会有两枚半克朗的硬币，有一次里面居然有半英镑的硬币。"
"Altogether I’ve got seven-and-thirty shillings wrapped up for Nanny.","我总共收到了三十七先令包着留给南妮的钱。"
"I never touch it, but I’ve often thought the poor mother feels near to God when she brings this money.","我从来没有动过这些钱，但是我经常想，当她送这些钱来的时候，这个可怜的母亲会感到上帝就在她身边。"
"Father wanted to set the policeman to watch, but I said No; for I was afraid if she was watched she might not come, and it seemed such a holy thing to be checking her in, I could not find in my heart to do it.”","父亲想安排警察来盯着，我说不要，因为我担心如果她发现了可能就不来了，知道她来过看起来是一件神圣的事情，我不忍心去破坏它。"
"“Oh, if we could but find her!","“哦，要是我们能够找到她多好！"
"I’d take her in my arms, and we’d just lie down and die together.”","我会把她抱在怀里，我们会一起躺下，死在一起。”"
"“Nay, don’t speak so!” said Susan, gently; “for all that’s come and gone, she may turn right at last.","“不，别这么说！”苏珊温和地说道，“经历了这么多的风风雨雨，她会变好的。"
"Mary Magdalen did, you know.”","抹大拉的玛利亚就做到了，你是知道的。”"
"“Eh! but I were nearer right about thee than Will.","“嗯！我对你的判断比威尔更准确。"
"He thought you would never look on him again if you knew about Lizzie.","他以为如果你知道了莉齐的事情你就不会再理他了。"
"But thou’rt not a Pharisee.”","但是你并不是一个伪善者。”"
"“I’m sorry he thought I could be so hard,” said Susan in a low voice, and colouring up.","“我很遗憾他认为我会那么冷酷。”苏珊红着脸，低声说道。"
"Then Mrs. Leigh was alarmed, and, in her motherly anxiety, she began to fear lest she had injured Will in Susan’s estimation.","这时利太太有点儿惊慌了，在她那慈母的焦虑中，她开始担心自己会损害了威尔在苏珊心目中的地位。"
"“You see Will thinks so much of you—gold would not be good enough for you to walk on, in his eye.","“你知道威尔是多么在乎你——在他眼里，让你脚踏黄金走路都是不够的。"
"He said you’d never look at him as he was, let alone his being brother to my poor wench.","他说你之前都不肯看他一眼，更别提他还是我那可怜女儿的哥哥。"
"He loves you so, it makes him think meanly on everything belonging to himself, as not fit to come near ye; but he’s a good lad, and a good son.","他是那么爱你，这让他把自己的一切都想得很卑贱，根本不配靠近你，但他是个好小伙子，也是个好儿子。"
"Thou’lt be a happy woman if thou’lt have him, so don’t let my words go against him—don’t!”","有了他你会成为一个幸福女人的，因此别让我的话影响到他——别！”"
"But Susan hung her head, and made no answer.","但是苏珊只是垂着头，没有任何反应。"
"She had not known until now that Will thought so earnestly and seriously about her; and even now she felt afraid that Mrs. Leigh’s words promised her too much happiness, and that they could not be true.","她直到现在才知道威尔是那么热烈那么认真地想念着她；她现在甚至开始害怕利太太的这些话给她承诺了太多的幸福，到头来却不是真的。"
"At any rate, the instinct of modesty made her shrink from saying anything which might seem like a confession of her own feelings to a third person.","无论如何，羞涩的本能让她退缩了，不愿说出任何听起来像是她对别人感情告白的话来。"
"Accordingly she turned the conversation on the child.","于是她把话题引向了孩子。"
"“I am sure he could not help loving Nanny,” said she.","“我肯定他会忍不住爱上南妮的，”她说道，"
"“There never was such a good little darling; don’t you think she’d win his heart if he knew she was his niece, and perhaps bring him to think kindly on his sister?”","“从未见过像她这样可爱的小宝贝，难道你不觉得如果他知道她是他的外甥女，她会赢得他的心，并且可能会让他对妹妹的态度好一些？”"
"“I dunnot know,” said Mrs. Leigh, shaking her head.","“我不知道，”利太太说道，摇了摇头，"
"“He has a turn in his eye like his father, that makes me—He’s right down good though.","“他眼神中有一点儿气质很像他的父亲，那让我——尽管他是一个绝对的好人。"
"But you see, I’ve never been a good one at managing folk; one severe look turns me sick, and then I say just the wrong thing, I’m so fluttered.","你看到了，我一点儿都不善于驾驭别人，一个严厉的眼神会让我心烦意乱，接下来就会说错话，我就是太紧张了。"
"Now I should like nothing better than to take Nancy home with me, but Tom knows nothing but that his sister is dead, and I’ve not the knack of speaking rightly to Will.","现在我只想把南妮带回家去，但是汤姆还对此一无所知，他只知道他的姐姐已经死了，并且我对如何跟威尔恰当地讲述这件事还没有一点儿头绪。"
"I dare not do it, and that’s the truth.","我不敢那样做，这是事实。"
"But you mun not think badly of Will.","但是你一定不要把威尔往坏处想。"
"He’s so good hissel, that he can’t understand how any one can do wrong; and, above all, I’m sure he loves you dearly.”","他自身太正直了，无法理解怎么会有人做坏事，并且，最重要的是，我肯定他非常爱你。”"
"“I don’t think I could part with Nancy,” said Susan, anxious to stop this revelation of Will’s attachment to herself.","“我想我舍不得与南希分开，”苏珊说道，急于阻止这披露威尔对她爱慕之情的话语，"
"“He’ll come round to her soon; he can’t fail; and I’ll keep a sharp look-out after the poor mother, and try and catch her the next time she comes with her little parcels of money.”","“他很快就会来这儿见到她的，他一定会来，我会特别留意她可怜的母亲，争取在她下次过来送钱时抓住她。”"
"“Ay, lass; we mun get hold of her; my Lizzie.","“好的，姑娘，我们一定要抓紧她，我的莉齐。"
"I love thee dearly for thy kindness to her child: but, if thou canst catch her for me, I’ll pray for thee when I’m too near my death to speak words; and, while I live, I’ll serve thee next to her—she mun come first, thou know’st.","你对她的孩子这么好，我会非常爱你的：即使你没能抓住她，我也会在无法语言表达的弥留之际为你祈祷的；并且，在我活着的时候，我会对待你仅次于我的女儿的——她必须要在你之前，你知道的。"
"God bless thee, lass.","上帝保佑你，姑娘。"
"My heart is lighter by a deal than it was when I comed in.","与刚进来时相比，我现在心情轻松多了。"
"Them lads will be looking for me home, and I mun go, and leave this little sweet one” (kissing it).","小伙子们会期待我回家的，我必须走了，必须离开这个小可爱。”（她亲了亲小孩）"
"“If I can take courage, I’ll tell Will all that has come and gone between us two.","“如果我能鼓起勇气，我会告诉威尔我们之间事情的来龙去脉。"
"He may come and see thee, mayn’t he?”","他可以过来看你，对吗？”"
"“Father will be very glad to see him, I’m sure,” replied Susan.","“父亲会非常高兴见到他的，我确信。”苏珊答道。"
"The way in which this was spoken satisfied Mrs. Leigh’s anxious heart that she had done Will no harm by what she had said; and, with many a kiss to the little one, and one more fervent tearful blessing on Susan, she went homewards.","苏珊回答的方式消除了利太太心中的焦虑，她说的这些话并没有给威尔带来危害；然后，在亲了小家伙很多次，又热泪盈眶地为苏珊祈福后，她才朝回家的方向走去。"

"CHAPTER III.","第三章"
"That night Mrs. Leigh stopped at home—that only night for many months.","那天晚上利太太没有出去——好几个月来的唯一一个晚上。"
"Even Tom, the scholar, looked up from his books in amazement; but then he remembered that Will had not been well, and that his mother’s attention having been called to the circumstance, it was only natural she should stay to watch him.","甚至连汤姆这个学者，都诧异地从看着的书本中抬起头来；但是接着他想到威尔最近身体一直不太好，母亲的注意力已经被吸引到这件事情上了，因此她留下来照看他再自然不过了。"
"And no watching could be more tender, or more complete.","没有比这更温柔、更无微不至的照看了。"
"Her loving eyes seemed never averted from his face—his grave, sad, careworn face.","她慈爱的目光似乎从未从他的脸庞上移开过——他那凝重、伤心、憔悴的脸庞。"
"When Tom went to bed the mother left her seat, and going up to Will, where he sat looking at the fire, but not seeing it, she kissed his forehead, and said—“Will! lad, I’ve been to see Susan Palmer!”","当汤姆睡觉以后，这位母亲离开座位，走到威尔跟前，他坐在那里眼睛盯着炉火，眼神却不知道在何处，她亲了下他的前额，说道：“威尔！我的孩子，我去看过苏珊·帕尔默了！”"
"She felt the start under her hand which was placed on his shoulder, but he was silent for a minute or two.","她放在他肩膀的手感觉到了他身体的震颤，但是他沉默了有一两分钟。"
"Then he said,—","然后他说道："
"“What took you there, mother?”","“你去那儿干什么，妈妈？”"
"“Why, my lad, it was likely I should wish to see one you cared for; I did not put myself forward.","“唉，我的孩子，我想去看看你喜欢的人是很正常的，我并不是要多管闲事。"
"I put on my Sunday clothes, and tried to behave as yo’d ha’ liked me.","我穿上了我最好的衣服，尽量按照你希望的方式来表现自己。"
"At least, I remember trying at first; but after, I forgot all.”","至少，我记得一开始是努力了，但是后来，我就全忘记了。”"
"She rather wished that he would question her as to what made her forget all.","她有点儿期望他会问她，是什么让她全忘了。"
"But he only said—","但他只是这样说："
"“How was she looking, mother?”","“妈妈，她看起来怎么样？”"
"“Well, thou seest I never set eyes on her before; but she’s a good, gentle-looking creature; and I love her dearly, as I’ve reason to.”","“哦，你知道我以前从未见过她；但是她很好，看起来很温和；我很喜欢她，我有理由喜欢她。”"
"Will looked up with momentary surprise, for his mother was too shy to be usually taken with strangers.","有那么一瞬间，威尔抬起头吃惊地望着她，因为他母亲一向很害羞，不会那么快喜欢上陌生人的。"
"But, after all, it was naturally in this case, for who could look at Susan without loving her?","但这次的情况也算自然了，毕竟，有谁能见了苏珊不喜欢呢？"
"So still he did not ask any questions, and his poor mother had to take courage, and try again to introduce the subject near to her heart.","因此，他仍然没有提出任何问题，他那可怜的母亲不得不鼓起勇气，再一次努力引导话题向她的内心靠拢。"
"But how?","但是怎么做呢？"
"“Will!” said she (jerking it out in sudden despair of her own powers to lead to what she wanted to say), “I telled her all.”","“威尔！”她说道（对自己引导话题能力的突然绝望让她脱口而出），“我把一切都告诉她了。”"
"“Mother! you’ve ruined me,” said he, standing up, and standing opposite to her with a stern white look of affright on his face.","“妈妈！你毁了我。”他说道，站起身来，站在她对面，苍白严肃的脸上写满了恐惧的神色。"
"“No! my own dear lad; dunnot look so scared; I have not ruined you!” she exclaimed, placing her two hands on his shoulders, and looking fondly into his face.","“不！我亲爱的孩子；别看起来那么害怕；我没有毁掉你！”她大声叫嚷着，双手放在他的肩膀上，温柔地盯着他的面庞，"
"“She’s not one to harden her heart against a mother’s sorrow.","“她不会对一个母亲的悲伤硬起心肠来的。"
"My own lad, she’s too good for that.","我的孩子，她太善良了。"
"She’s not one to judge and scorn the sinner.","她也不会随便评判和蔑视犯错的罪人。"
"She’s too deep read in her New Testament for that.","她深谙新约中的教义。"
"Take courage, Will; and thou mayst, for I watched her well, though it is not for one woman to let out another’s secret.","拿出你的勇气，威尔，你可以的，我留意观察过她了，尽管我不该泄露一个女人的秘密。"
"Sit thee down, lad, for thou look’st very white.”","你坐下，孩子，你的脸色看起来很苍白。”"
"He sat down.","他坐下了。"
"His mother drew a stool towards him, and sat at his feet.","母亲拉过来一条凳子，坐在他的脚边。"
"“Did you tell her about Lizzie, then?” asked he, hoarse and low.","“那么，你告诉她莉齐的事了吗？”他问道，声音嘶哑低沉。"
"“I did; I telled her all! and she fell a-crying over my deep sorrow, and the poor wench’s sin.","“我告诉她了，我全部都告诉她了！她为我那深深的悲伤，和我那可怜孩子的罪孽而流泪。"
"And then a light comed into her face, trembling and quivering with some new glad thought; and what dost thou think it was, Will, lad?","接下来，她的脸上又有了光彩，因为一些令人欣慰的想法而发抖、震颤；威尔，孩子，你知道那是什么想法吗？"
"Nay, I’ll not misdoubt but that thy heart will give thanks as mine did, afore God and His angels, for her great goodness.","不，我丝毫不怀疑你的内心将会和我一样，在上帝以及他的天使面前，感激她那伟大的美德。"
"That little Nanny is not her niece, she’s our Lizzie’s own child, my little grandchild.”","那个小南妮并不是她的外甥女，而是我们莉齐的孩子，我的小外孙女。”"
"She could no longer restrain her tears; and they fell hot and fast, but still she looked into his face.","她再也无法抑制，热泪潸然而下，但是她仍然盯着他的面孔。"
"“Did she know it was Lizzie’s child?","“她知道那是莉齐的孩子吗？"
"I do not comprehend,” said he, flushing red.","我想不通。”他说道，脸色涨红。"
"“She knows now: she did not at first, but took the little helpless creature in, out of her own pitiful, loving heart, guessing only that it was the child of shame; and she’s worked for it, and kept it, and tended it ever sin’ it were a mere baby, and loves it fondly.","“她现在知道了：一开始她并不知情，但是出于慈悲和同情，她把这个无助的孩子带了回去，猜测她肯定是一个私生女；从她还只是个婴儿开始，她就为她而工作，抚养她，照顾她，而且非常喜爱她。"
"Will! won’t you love it?” asked she, beseechingly.","威尔！你会爱她吗？”她乞求地问道。"
"He was silent for an instant; then he said, “Mother, I’ll try.","他沉默了有一瞬间，然后说道：“妈妈，我会努力的。"
"Give me time, for all these things startle me.","给我时间，这一切让我感到震惊。"
"To think of Susan having to do with such a child!”","想想苏珊和这样一个孩子的关系！”"
"“Ay, Will! and to think, as may be, yet of Susan having to do with the child’s mother!","“可以，威尔！你也可以想想苏珊和这个孩子的母亲的关系！"
"For she is tender and pitiful, and speaks hopefully of my lost one, and will try and find her for me, when she comes, as she does sometimes, to thrust money under the door, for her baby.","她是那么温柔和善良，当提到我那丢失的孩子，她也是满怀希望，并且会尽量在她过来时帮我找到她，因为她有时会过来在门下塞些钱给孩子。"
"Think of that, Will.","想想这些，威尔。"
"Here’s Susan, good and pure as the angels in heaven, yet, like them, full of hope and mercy, and one who, like them, will rejoice over her as repents.","这就是苏珊，善良，纯洁，有如天使下凡，和他们一样，充满了希望和仁慈，和他们一样，会为你妹妹的忏悔感到由衷的高兴。"
"Will, my lad, I’m not afeard of you now; and I must speak, and you must listen.","威尔，我的孩子，我现在不害怕你了；我必须得说，你也必须得听。"
"I am your mother, and I dare to command you, because I know I am in the right, and that God is on my side.","我是你的母亲，我敢这样命令你，因为我知道我是正确的，上帝也站在我这边。"
"If He should lead the poor wandering lassie to Susan’s door, and she comes back, crying and sorryful, led by that good angel to us once more, thou shalt never say a casting-up word to her about her sin, but be tender and helpful towards one ‘who was lost and is found;’ so may God’s blessing rest on thee, and so mayst thou lead Susan home as thy wife.”","如果上帝指引那可怜的流浪女来到苏珊的门前，由那个好心的天使再把她领回到我们身边，你不许对她的过错说一句攻击性的语言，要对这‘失而复得’的人温柔一点儿，尽量帮助她；这样上帝才会保佑你，你才可以把苏珊娶回来当妻子。”"
"She stood no longer as the meek, imploring, gentle mother, but firm and dignified, as if the interpreter of God’s will.","她不再是那个懦弱、哀求、温顺的母亲，而是变得坚定、端庄，仿佛是上帝旨意的阐释者。"
"Her manner was so unusual and solemn, that it overcame all Will’s pride and stubbornness.","她的举止是那么反常和庄严，压过了威尔所有的傲慢和固执。"
"He rose softly while she was speaking, and bent his head, as if in reverence at her words, and the solemn injunction which they conveyed.","他在她说话的时候轻轻地站了起来，低下头，好像在向她所说的话以及它们所传达的庄严嘱托致敬。"
"When she had spoken, he said, in so subdued a voice that she was almost surprised at the sound, “Mother, I will.”","在她说完后，他说道：“妈妈，我会的。”他的声音是那么顺从，让她几乎感到有点儿震惊。"
"“I may be dead and gone; but, all the same, thou wilt take home the wandering sinner, and heal up her sorrows, and lead her to her Father’s house.","“即使我离开了人世，你依然要把那个迷途的罪人带回家，抚慰她内心的创伤，引导她回到她父亲的家中。"
"My lad!","我的孩子！"
"I can speak no more; I’m turned very faint.”","我不能再说了，我现在很虚弱。”"
"He placed her in a chair; he ran for water.","他扶她坐在椅子上，跑去给她倒水。"
"She opened her eyes, and smiled.","她睁开双眼，面带微笑。"
"“God bless you, Will.","“上帝保佑你，威尔。"
"Oh!","哦！"
"I am so happy.","我真高兴。"
"It seems as if she were found; my heart is so filled with gladness.”","仿佛她已经被找回来了，我的心中充满了喜悦。”"
"That night Mr. Palmer stayed out late and long.","那天晚上帕尔默先生在外面呆到很晚。"
"Susan was afraid that he was at his old haunts and habits—getting tipsy at some public-house; and this thought oppressed her, even though she had so much to make her happy in the consciousness that Will loved her.","苏珊担心他去了以前经常出入的地方——在某个酒馆里酩酊大醉；这种想法折磨着她，尽管知道威尔爱着她让她不知道有多高兴。"
"She sat up long, and then she went to bed, leaving all arranged as well as she could for her father’s return.","她熬了很久才去睡觉，尽可能把一切安排妥当，等着父亲回来。"
"She looked at the little rosy, sleeping girl who was her bed-fellow, with redoubled tenderness, and with many a prayerful thought.","她望着脸色红润，正在酣睡的小女孩，她的床伴，不禁又多了一份温柔和许多虔诚的思潮。"
"The little arms entwined her neck as she lay down, for Nanny was a light sleeper, and was conscious that she, who was loved with all the power of that sweet, childish heart, was near her, and by her, although she was too sleepy to utter any of her half-formed words.","当苏珊躺下时，那双小手臂就缠绕着她的脖颈，南妮的睡觉很轻，因此当苏珊（她用甜美、幼小的心灵中所有力量去爱着的苏珊）靠近她，在她身边躺下时，她是有感觉的，即便已经困得无法发出任何牙牙学语的声音。"
"And, by-and-by, she heard her father come home, stumbling uncertain, trying first the windows, and next the door fastenings, with many a loud incoherent murmur.","不久，苏珊听到了父亲回来的声音，跌跌撞撞，乱摸一通，先是窗户，接着是门闩，断断续续不停地大声咕哝着什么。"
"The little innocent twined around her seemed all the sweeter and more lovely, when she thought sadly of her erring father.","她伤心地想着她那犯错的父亲，觉得缠绕在她脖颈上的这个小天真越发温柔，越发可爱。"
"And presently he called aloud for a light.","不久他又嚷嚷着要灯火。"
"She had left matches and all arranged as usual on the dresser; but, fearful of some accident from fire, in his unusually intoxicated state, she now got up softly, and putting on a cloak, went down to his assistance.","像往常一样，她把火柴摆好放在餐具柜上了，可是害怕他这样酩酊大醉的样子会闹出什么火灾，她很快轻轻地起了床，披上一件斗篷，下楼来帮忙。"
"Alas! the little arms that were unclosed from her soft neck belonged to a light, easily awakened sleeper.","唉！从她那柔软的脖颈上解下来的那双小手臂的主人是一个睡觉很轻，很容易就惊醒的人。"
"Nanny missed her darling Susy; and terrified at being left alone, in the vast mysterious darkness, which had no bounds and seemed infinite, she slipped out of bed, and tottered, in her little nightgown, towards the door.","南妮想念着她亲爱的苏西，一个人被扔在这广袤诡秘、无边无际的黑暗中，她吓坏了，溜下床，穿着小睡袍，脚步蹒跚地向门口走去。"
"There was a light below, and there was Susy and safety!","楼下有一抹灯光，苏西就在楼下，那里很安全！"
"So she went onwards two steps towards the steep, abrupt stairs; and then, dazzled by sleepiness, she stood, she wavered, she fell!","于是她向前朝着陡峭突兀的楼梯走了两步，她睡眼惺忪地停了下来，摇摇晃晃，摔了下去！"
"Down on her head on the stone floor she fell!","她头朝下摔在了石头铺的地面上！"
"Susan flew to her, and spoke all soft, entreating, loving words; but her white lids covered up the blue violets of eyes, and there was no murmur came out of the pale lips.","苏珊飞奔向她，说出了所有温柔、恳求、关爱的话语；但是苍白的眼睑遮住了那双紫罗兰色的双眼，再也没有呢喃声从那苍白的嘴唇下发出来。"
"The warm tears that rained down did not awaken her; she lay stiff, and weary with her short life, on Susan’s knee.","如雨水般洒落的温热泪水也唤不醒她，仿佛厌倦了她那短暂的一生，她僵直地躺在苏珊的膝盖上。"
"Susan went sick with terror.","苏珊因为恐惧而变得心慌意乱。"
"She carried her upstairs, and laid her tenderly in bed; she dressed herself most hastily, with her trembling fingers.","她把她抱上楼去，轻轻地把她放在床上，颤抖着双手匆忙地穿上衣服。"
"Her father was asleep on the settle downstairs; and useless, and worse than useless, if awake.","她的父亲在楼下的长椅上睡着了，一点儿用都没有，如果他醒着，会更加有害无益。"
"But Susan flew out of the door, and down the quiet resounding street, towards the nearest doctor’s house.","苏珊飞奔出门，沿着死寂的街道，朝着就近的大夫家跑去。"
"Quickly she went, but as quickly a shadow followed, as if impelled by some sudden terror.","她跑得很快，但是后面的一个身影跟得也很快，仿佛被什么突袭的恐惧驱赶着一般。"
"Susan rang wildly at the night-bell—the shadow crouched near.","苏珊疯狂地按着夜间门铃——后面的身影尾随而至。"
"The doctor looked out from an upstairs window.","医生从楼上的窗户往外看。"
"“A little child has fallen downstairs, at No.9 Crown Street, and is very ill—dying, I’m afraid.","“一个小孩从楼上摔下来了，在克罗街9号，她病得很厉害——恐怕快不行了。"
"Please, for God’s sake, sir, come directly.","求求你，看在上帝的份上，先生，马上来吧。"
"No.9 Crown Street.”","克罗街9号。”"
"“I’ll be there directly,” said he, and shut the window.","“我马上就过去。”他说道，关上了窗户。"
"“For that God you have just spoken about—for His sake—tell me, are you Susan Palmer?","“像你刚才说的那样——看在上帝的份上——告诉我，你是苏珊·帕尔默吗？”"
"Is it my child that lies a-dying?” said the shadow, springing forwards, and clutching poor Susan’s arm.","是我的孩子快要不行了吗？”后面的身影说道，冲上前来，紧紧抓住了可怜的苏珊的手臂。"
"“It is a little child of two years old.","“是个两岁的孩子。"
"I do not know whose it is; I love it as my own.","我不知道是谁的孩子，我爱她就像我自己的孩子。"
"Come with me, whoever you are; come with me.”","跟我一起来，不管你是谁，跟我一起来吧。”"
"The two sped along the silent streets—as silent as the night were they.","两人疾步行走在寂静的街道上——和这夜晚一样寂静。"
"They entered the house; Susan snatched up the light, and carried it upstairs.","她们进了房子，苏珊把灯点亮，向楼上走去。"
"The other followed.","另一个人紧跟着。"
"She stood with wild, glaring eyes by the bedside, never looking at Susan, but hungrily gazing at the little, white, still child.","她站在床边，双眼露出疯狂、炽热的目光，她根本没有看苏珊，而是贪婪地凝视着那个瘦小、苍白、安静的孩子。"
"She stooped down, and put her hand tight on her own heart, as if to still its beating, and bent her ear to the pale lips.","她俯下身，一只手紧紧地捂住自己的胸口，似乎要终止心脏的跳动，然后把耳朵俯在那苍白的嘴唇上聆听。"
"Whatever the result was, she did not speak; but threw off the bed-clothes wherewith Susan had tenderly covered up the little creature, and felt its left side.","无论结果怎样，她一句话都没有说；她扯掉了苏珊轻轻盖在小家伙身上的被褥，感受她的心跳。"
"Then she threw up her arms, with a cry of wild despair.","然后她张开双臂，发出疯狂绝望的哭声。"
"“She is dead! she is dead!”","“她死了！她死了！”"
"She looked so fierce, so mad, so haggard, that, for an instant, Susan was terrified; the next, the holy God had put courage into her heart, and her pure arms were round that guilty, wretched creature, and her tears were falling fast and warm upon her breast.","她看上去是那么凶猛，那么疯狂，那么憔悴，以至于有那么一瞬间，苏珊被吓到了；但很快，神圣的上帝又让她鼓起了勇气，她用双臂紧紧抱着那个内疚、可怜的人，热泪滚滚而下，温暖着她的胸膛。"
"But she was thrown off with violence.","但是她被用力甩开了。"
"“You killed her—you slighted her—you let her fall down those stairs! you killed her!”","“是你杀了她——你没看好她——你让她从楼梯上摔了下来！是你杀了她！”"
"Susan cleared off the thick mist before her, and, gazing at the mother with her clear, sweet angel eyes, said, mournfully—“I would have laid down my own life for her.”","苏珊擦去了眼前厚厚的一层水雾，用她那清澈、温柔如天使般的双眼望着这个母亲，伤心地说道：“我宁愿舍弃自己的生命来换回她的。”"
"“Oh, the murder is on my soul!” exclaimed the wild, bereaved mother, with the fierce impetuosity of one who has none to love her, and to be beloved, regard to whom might teach self-restraint.","“哦，我的心也死了！”这个疯狂的失去孩子的母亲嚷道，失去了爱她和她爱的人，她的情绪极度暴躁，几乎无法控制。"
"“Hush!” said Susan, her finger on her lips.","“嘘！”苏珊轻声说道，手指放在嘴唇上。"
"“Here is the doctor.","“医生来了。"
"God may suffer her to live.”","愿上帝让她活下去。”"
"The poor mother turned sharp round.","可怜的母亲突然转过头来。"
"The doctor mounted the stair.","医生走上楼来。"
"Ah! that mother was right; the little child was really dead and gone.","唉！孩子的母亲是对的，小孩已经不在人世了。"
"And when he confirmed her judgment, the mother fell down in a fit.","得知她的判断被确认属实，这位母亲昏倒在了地上。"
"Susan, with her deep grief, had to forget herself, and forget her darling (her charge for years), and question the doctor what she must do with the poor wretch, who lay on the floor in such extreme of misery.","苏珊，带着一颗沉痛的心，不得不忘掉自己，忘掉她的宝贝（她照顾了多年的宝贝），她向医生询问需要为这个躺在地上，陷入极度悲伤的可怜人做点儿什么。"
"“She is the mother!” said she.","“她是孩子的母亲！”她说道。"
"“Why did she not take better care of her child?” asked he, almost angrily.","“为什么她没有好好照顾自己的孩子？”他近乎生气地问道。"
"But Susan only said, “The little child slept with me; and it was I that left her.”","可是苏珊仅仅回答说：“孩子是和我睡在一起的，是我离开了她。”"
"“I will go back and make up a composing draught; and while I am away you must get her to bed.”","“我会回来给她配一些药水，我不在时你一定要把她弄到床上去。”"
"Susan took out some of her own clothes, and softly undressed the stiff, powerless form.","苏珊找出几件她自己的衣服，轻轻地把衣服从那僵硬无力的身体上换掉。"
"There was no other bed in the house but the one in which her father slept.","除了楼下她父亲睡觉的地方以外，房子里再没有其他的床了。"
"So she tenderly lifted the body of her darling; and was going to take it downstairs, but the mother opened her eyes, and seeing what she was about, she said—“I am not worthy to touch her, I am so wicked.","因此她轻柔地抱起了她的宝贝，准备把她带到楼下去，但是孩子的母亲这时睁开了双眼，看到这些，她说道：“我不配碰她，我太可恶了。"
"I have spoken to you as I never should have spoken; but I think you are very good.","我永远都不该像刚才那样对你说话，但是我想你是一个非常好的人。"
"May I have my own child to lie in my arms for a little while?”","我可以把我的孩子抱在怀里一会儿吗？”"
"Her voice was so strange a contrast to what it had been before she had gone into the fit, that Susan hardly recognised it: it was now so unspeakably soft, so irresistibly pleading; the features too had lost their fierce expression, and were almost as placid as death.","她的声音和昏倒之前有着天壤之别，苏珊几乎没有听出来：此刻是说不出的温柔，如此令人难以抗拒的恳求；她的面容也没有了之前的狂暴表情，现在几乎是平静得如死人一般。"
"Susan could not speak, but she carried the little child, and laid it in its mother’s arms; then, as she looked at them, something overpowered her, and she knelt down, crying aloud—“Oh, my God, my God, have mercy on her, and forgive and comfort her.”","苏珊说不出话来，但她还是把孩子抱过来，放到她母亲的怀里；然后，当她望着她们时，她再也控制不住，跪了下来，大声哭起来：“哦，上帝，我的上帝，宽恕她吧，请原谅她，给她安慰。”"
"But the mother kept smiling, and stroking the little face, murmuring soft, tender words, as if it were alive.","但是孩子的母亲却一直在微笑，抚摸着孩子的小脸，低声发出轻柔、温和的话语，好像孩子还活着一样。"
"She was going mad, Susan thought; but she prayed on, and on, and ever still she prayed with streaming eyes.","她快要疯了，苏珊心想，她不停地在祈祷，眼中的泪水也一直没有干。"
"The doctor came with the draught.","医生带着药水回来了。"
"The mother took it, with docile unconsciousness of its nature as medicine.","孩子的母亲服了药，温顺得连药的名字都不去问。"
"The doctor sat by her; and soon she fell asleep.","医生坐在她的身旁，很快她就睡着了。"
"Then he rose softly, and beckoning Susan to the door, he spoke to her there.","然后他轻轻地站起来，示意苏珊到门口来，在那里和她说话。"
"“You must take the corpse out of her arms.","“你必须把尸体从她怀里拿开。"
"She will not awake.","她不会醒的。"
"That draught will make her sleep for many hours.","那药水会让她睡很多个小时。"
"I will call before noon again.","中午前我会再来看看。"
"It is now daylight.","现在天亮了。"
"Good-by.”","再见吧。”"
"Susan shut him out; and then, gently extricating the dead child from its mother’s arms, she could not resist making her own quiet moan over her darling.","苏珊把他送了出去，然后，轻轻地把死去的孩子从母亲怀里解脱出来，她再也控制不住自己，开始为她的小心肝无声地呜咽。"
"She tried to learn off its little placid face, dumb and pale before her.","她试图记住那张安详的小脸，在她面前是那么沉默、苍白。"
"Not all the scalding tears of care","所有关心的热泪，"
"Shall wash away that vision fair;","也不能冲走眼前这番景象；"
"Not all the thousand thoughts that rise,","所有产生的万千思绪，"
"Not all the sights that dim her eyes,","所有模糊她双眼的景象，"
"Shall e’er usurp the place","也不能侵占那天使般的面孔，"
"Of that little angel-face.","曾经呆过的地方。"
"And then she remembered what remained to be done.","然后她想起了接下来要做的事情。"
"She saw that all was right in the house; her father was still dead asleep on the settle, in spite of all the noise of the night.","她看到房子里的一切都还算正常，尽管昨夜有那么多的噪音，她的父亲却仍然在长椅上酣睡，"
"She went out through the quiet streets, deserted still, although it was broad daylight, and to where the Leighs lived.","虽然天已经大亮了，但街道上仍然空荡荡的，她出门穿过安静的街道，向着利家住的地方走去。"
"Mrs. Leigh, who kept her country hours, was opening her window-shutters.","利太太一直遵守着乡下的作息时间，已经在打开窗户摇杆了。"
"Susan took her by the arm, and, without speaking, went into the house-place.","苏珊抓住她的手臂，一句话也没说，进到房子里面。"
"There she knelt down before the astonished Mrs. Leigh, and cried as she had never done before; but the miserable night had overpowered her, and she who had gone through so much calmly, now that the pressure seemed removed could not find the power to speak.","她跪在惊愕的利太太面前，前所未有地失声痛哭；这痛苦的一夜已经击溃了她，之前她一直表现得都很沉着，但现在压力似乎被抛除了，她却找不到说话的力量。"
"“My poor dear!","“我可怜的宝贝！"
"What has made thy heart so sore as to come and cry a-this-ons?","是什么让你如此伤心哭成这样？"
"Speak and tell me.","告诉我。"
"Nay, cry on, poor wench, if thou canst not speak yet.","不，如果你现在说不出来，继续哭吧，可怜的姑娘。"
"It will ease the heart, and then thou canst tell me.”","这样会让你感觉好受点儿，然后你可以告诉我怎么回事。”"
"“Nanny is dead!” said Susan.","“南妮死了！”苏珊说道，"
"“I left her to go to father, and she fell downstairs, and never breathed again.","“我撇下她去找父亲，她从楼梯上摔了下来，就再也没有呼吸了。"
"Oh, that’s my sorrow!","哦，这是我的悲伤！"
"But I’ve more to tell.","但是我还有更多的话要说。"
"Her mother is come—is in our house!","她母亲来了——在我家里！"
"Come and see if it’s your Lizzie.”","去看看是不是你的莉齐。”"
"Mrs. Leigh could not speak, but, trembling, put on her things and went with Susan in dizzy haste back to Crown Street.","利太太说不出话来，只是颤抖地穿好衣服，跟着苏珊，晕乎乎慌里慌张地赶回克罗街。"

"CHAPTER IV.","第四章"
"As they entered the house in Crown Street, they perceived that the door would not open freely on its hinges, and Susan instinctively looked behind to see the cause of the obstruction.","当她们来到克朗街苏珊家时，发现装在铰链上的门无法自由地转动，于是苏珊本能地往门后查看是什么导致了阻塞。"
"She immediately recognised the appearance of a little parcel, wrapped in a scrap of newspaper, and evidently containing money.","她立刻认出了一个小包裹的样子，用一片废报纸包着，里面明显装了钱。"
"She stooped and picked it up.","她弯腰捡了起来。"
"“Look!” said she, sorrowfully, “the mother was bringing this for her child last night.”","“看！”她伤心地说道，“孩子的母亲昨天晚上给孩子送来这些东西。”"
"But Mrs. Leigh did not answer.","可是利太太没有任何反应。"
"So near to the ascertaining if it were her lost child or no, she could not be arrested, but pressed onwards with trembling steps and a beating, fluttering heart.","现在距离弄清楚是不是她丢失的孩子是如此之近，她不能再有任何耽搁，只有拖着发抖的脚步，怀揣一颗跳动、震颤的心坚决前行。"
"She entered the bedroom, dark and still.","她走进卧室，里面一片漆黑寂静。"
"She took no heed of the little corpse over which Susan paused, but she went straight to the bed, and, withdrawing the curtain, saw Lizzie; but not the former Lizzie, bright, gay, buoyant, and undimmed.","苏珊在那个小小的遗体旁停了下来，但是利太太根本没有留意到这些，她径直奔到床边，拉开窗帘，看到了莉齐；只是不再是从前的那个莉齐，那时的她开朗，快乐，活泼，光彩照人。"
"This Lizzie was old before her time; her beauty was gone; deep lines of care, and, alas! of want (or thus the mother imagined) were printed on the cheek, so round, and fair, and smooth, when last she gladdened her mother’s eyes.","眼前的莉齐看起来比实际年龄要老了很多；她不再美丽；过度的操劳以及营养不良（这或许是她母亲自己臆断的）在她的脸颊上刻下了深深的皱纹，上一次她让母亲的眼睛充满喜悦时，她的脸庞还是那么圆润、美丽和光滑。"
"Even in her sleep she bore the look of woe and despair which was the prevalent expression of her face by day; even in her sleep she had forgotten how to smile.","即使在睡着的时候，她的脸上都带着悲痛和绝望的表情，一天来都是这样；即使在睡着的时候她都想不起如何微笑。"
"But all these marks of the sin and sorrow she had passed through only made her mother love her the more.","但是所有这些她遭受过的罪恶和伤痛的印记只会让她的母亲更加爱她。"
"She stood looking at her with greedy eyes, which seemed as though no gazing could satisfy their longing; and at last she stooped down and kissed the pale, worn hand that lay outside the bed-clothes.","她站在那儿，用贪婪的目光望着女儿，似乎任何凝望都无法满足她们之间的渴望；终于她俯下身去亲吻那只露在被褥外面的苍白、粗糙的手。"
"No touch disturbed the sleeper; the mother need not have laid the hand so gently down upon the counterpane.","任何触摸都唤不醒这个沉睡者，她的母亲根本无需那么轻柔地把她的手放在床单上。"
"There was no sign of life, save only now and then a deep sob-like sigh.","莉齐没有一点儿生命的迹象，除了时不时发出一声低沉如啜泣般的叹息。"
"Mrs. Leigh sat down beside the bed, and still holding back the curtain, looked on and on, as if she could never be satisfied.","利太太在床边坐下来，窗帘仍然拉开着，她就这么一直看着，似乎永远都看不够。"
"Susan would fain have stayed by her darling one; but she had many calls upon her time and thoughts, and her will had now, as ever, to be given up to that of others.","如果继续呆在她的小宝贝身边，苏珊会晕倒的，但是她还有很多事情要做，很多主意要拿，她现在不得不把个人情感，和之前一样，为了其他事情搁置到一边。"
"All seemed to devolve the burden of their cares on her.","所有人的烦恼似乎都转移到了她的身上。"
"Her father, ill-humoured from his last night’s intemperance, did not scruple to reproach her with being the cause of little Nanny’s death; and when, after bearing his upbraiding meekly for some time, she could no longer restrain herself, but began to cry, he wounded her even more by his injudicious attempts at comfort; for he said it was as well the child was dead; it was none of theirs, and why should they be troubled with it?","她的父亲经历了昨晚的酗酒之后变得脾气暴躁，毫无顾忌地指责她才是导致小南妮死亡的原因；有那么一段时间，她温顺地忍受着他的斥责，之后她再也无法控制自己，开始放声大哭，而他试图安慰她的莽撞语言，让她更加受伤；他说孩子都已经死了；又不是他们的孩子，他们为什么要感到不安？"
"Susan wrung her hands at this, and came and stood before her father, and implored him to forbear.","苏珊懊恼地搓着双手，来到父亲身边恳求他不要再说了。"
"Then she had to take all requisite steps for the coroner’s inquest; she had to arrange for the dismissal of her school; she had to summons a little neighbour, and send his willing feet on a message to William Leigh, who, she felt, ought to be informed of his mother’s whereabouts, and of the whole state of affairs.","接下来她需要配合验尸官的调查而采取一些必需的举措；她不得不安排学校停课；然后她又不得不找来一个邻居小孩，派他去给威廉·利送信，她觉得他应该知道母亲的下落以及整个事情的进展。"
"She asked her messenger to tell him to come and speak to her; that his mother was at her house.","她吩咐送信人告诉威尔让他过来，她有话要说，还有他的母亲在她家里。"
"She was thankful that her father sauntered out to have a gossip at the nearest coach-stand, and to relate as many of the night’s adventures as he knew; for as yet he was in ignorance of the watcher and the watched, who silently passed away the hours upstairs.","令她感到欣慰的是，父亲终于出门了，来到就近的一个马车停靠点上聊天，向人们讲述他昨晚的经历；所幸他并不知道家里楼上的看护者和被看护的人，她们已经在一起静静地呆了好几个小时了。"
"At dinner-time Will came.","到了晚饭时刻，威尔过来了。"
"He looked red, glad, impatient, excited.","他看起来满脸通红，兴高采烈，急切而激动。"
"Susan stood calm and white before him, her soft, loving eyes gazing straight into his.","苏珊平静地站在他面前，脸色苍白，她那温柔而充满爱意的双眼紧盯着他的眼睛。"
"“Will,” said she, in a low, quiet voice, “your sister is upstairs.”","“威尔，”她用低沉、平静的声音说道，“你妹妹在楼上，”"
"“My sister!” said he, as if affrighted at the idea, and losing his glad look in one of gloom.","“我妹妹！”他说道，仿佛被吓到了，刚才的兴奋表情被一种阴郁所取代。"
"Susan saw it, and her heart sank a little, but she went on as calm to all appearance as ever.","苏珊看到了他表情的变化，她的心蓦地一沉，但是她外表还是保持着一如既往的冷静。"
"“She was little Nanny’s mother, as perhaps you know.","“她就是小南妮的母亲，你可能知道这些。"
"Poor little Nanny was killed last night by a fall downstairs.”","可怜的小南妮昨天晚上从楼梯上摔死了。”"
"All the calmness was gone; all the suppressed feeling was displayed in spite of every effort.","说到这里，她所有的冷静全都不见了，所有努力压抑的情感控制不住地宣泄出来。"
"She sat down, and hid her face from him, and cried bitterly.","她坐了下来，在他跟前掩面失声痛哭。"
"He forgot everything but the wish, the longing to comfort her.","他忘记了一切，满脑子只有想去安抚她的愿望和冲动。"
"He put his arm round her waist, and bent over her.","他用手臂搂住她的腰，俯下身去安慰她。"
"But all he could say, was, “Oh, Susan, how can I comfort you?","但是他唯一能说的就是：“哦，苏珊，我该怎么安慰你？"
"Don’t take on so—pray don’t!”","别这样——求求你别这样！”"
"He never changed the words, but the tone varied every time he spoke.","他的话语一直都没有变化，但是每次说话时的语气都有所不同。"
"At last she seemed to regain her power over herself; and she wiped her eyes, and once more looked upon him with her own quiet, earnest, unfearing gaze.","最终，她似乎恢复了自己的力量，擦干眼睛，再一次用她安静、诚挚和无畏的目光注视着他。"
"“Your sister was near the house.","“你妹妹当时就在房子附近。"
"She came in on hearing my words to the doctor.","她进来时听到了我对医生说的话。"
"She is asleep now, and your mother is watching her.","她现在睡着了，你母亲在照看她。"
"I wanted to tell you all myself.","我想亲自告诉你这些。"
"Would you like to see your mother?”","你想去看看你的母亲吗？”"
"“No!” said he.","“不！”他说道，"
"“I would rather see none but thee.","“我谁都不想见，我只想看到你。"
"Mother told me thou knew’st all.”","妈妈告诉我你知道了一切。”"
"His eyes were downcast in their shame.","他羞耻地垂下了眼睛。"
"But the holy and pure did not lower or veil her eyes.","可是这位神圣、纯洁的姑娘并没有低下或者遮掩她的眼睛。"
"She said, “Yes, I know all—all but her sufferings.","她说道：“是的，我知道了一切——除了她那些苦难的遭遇。"
"Think what they must have been!”","想想她都经历了什么！”"
"He made answer, low and stern, “She deserved them all; every jot.”","他回答的声音不大却很严厉：“她理应承受这一切，每一丁点儿。”"
"“In the eye of God, perhaps she does.","“在上帝的眼里，或许这是她应得的。"
"He is the Judge; we are not.”","上帝才是最高审判者，而不是你我。”"
"“Oh!” she said, with a sudden burst, “Will Leigh!","“哦！”她说道，突然爆发了，“威尔·利！"
"I have thought so well of you; don’t go and make me think you cruel and hard.","我一直都认为你是个很好的人，别让我觉得你残忍、冷酷。"
"Goodness is not goodness unless there is mercy and tenderness with it.","如果没有了慈悲和温柔，美德也就不再是美德了。"
"There is your mother, who has been nearly heart-broken, now full of rejoicing over her child.","还有你的母亲，曾经几乎心碎了，现在却充满了找回孩子的喜悦。"
"Think of your mother.”","想一想你的母亲吧。”"
"“I do think of her,” said he.","“我的确想到她了，”他说道，"
"“I remember the promise I gave her last night.","“我记得我昨天晚上对她的承诺。"
"Thou shouldst give me time.","你应该给我时间。"
"I would do right in time.","我会妥当处理的。"
"I never think it o’er in quiet.","我还没有安静地想清楚。"
"But I will do what is right and fitting, never fear.","但是，别怕，我会做出正确、恰当的选择的。"
"Thou hast spoken out very plain to me, and misdoubted me, Susan; I love thee so, that thy words cut me.","你已经对我说得很明白了，你不相信我，苏珊，我是那么爱你，你的话刺伤了我。"
"If I did hang back a bit from making sudden promises, it was because not even for love of thee, would I say what I was not feeling; and at first I could not feel all at once as thou wouldst have me.","如果我对做出这些突然的承诺确实有所迟疑的话，那是因为我若不是爱你如斯，我也不会说出我心中的真实感受；一开始我无法马上像你希望的那样去感受。"
"But I’m not cruel and hard; for if I had been, I should na’ have grieved as I have done.”","但是我不残忍，也不冷酷，因为如果我是那样的人，我就不会像我表现得那么伤心。”"
"He made as if he were going away; and indeed he did feel he would rather think it over in quiet.","他的话让人觉得他仿佛要离开了，事实上他确实认为他应该安静地把事情想清楚。"
"But Susan, grieved at her incautious words, which had all the appearance of harshness, went a step or two nearer—paused—and then, all over blushes, said in a low, soft whisper—","但是苏珊后悔自己轻率地说出了这么刺耳的话，上前走了一两步——然后停下——接着，她满面通红，以轻柔的耳语说道："
"“Oh, Will!","“哦，威尔！"
"I beg your pardon.","请原谅。"
"I am very sorry.","我很抱歉。"
"Won’t you forgive me?”","你会原谅我吗？”"

"Mrs. Leigh did not turn away, nor move; for it seemed as if motion would unlock the stony command over herself which, while so perfectly still, she was enabled to preserve.","利太太没有转过身去，甚至都没有动，似乎任何的动作都会打破她对自己坚如磐石般的控制，只有完全静止，她才能够继续保持下去。"
"But by-and-by Lizzie cried out, in a piercing voice of agony—","但是很快莉齐就哭了出来，哭声刺耳凄厉："
"“Mother, don’t look at me!","“妈妈，不要看着我！"
"I have been so wicked!” and instantly she hid her face, and grovelled among the bed-clothes, and lay like one dead, so motionless was she.","我是那么邪恶！”她迅速捂住了脸，倒在被褥之间，像一个死人般躺着，一动不动。"

"Mrs. Leigh folded her hands, and strove to speak very clearly, while she repeated every tender and merciful text she could remember.","利太太双手合十，重复诵念着她能记起来的每一个温柔慈悲的章节，努力使自己的声音非常清晰。"

"Oh, woe!","哦，呜呜！"
"Oh, woe!”","哦，呜呜！”"
"She shook with exceeding sorrow.","她极度悲哀地摇了摇头。"
"In her earnestness of speech she had uncovered her face, and tried to read Mrs. Leigh’s thoughts through her looks.","在她说出这些诚挚的话时，双手已经从脸上拿开，试图从利太太的表情读出她心里面的想法。"
"And when she saw those aged eyes brimming full of tears, and marked the quivering lips, she threw her arms round the faithful mother’s neck, and wept there, as she had done in many a childish sorrow, but with a deeper, a more wretched grief.","当她看到那双老迈的双眼噙满了泪水，留意到那颤抖着的嘴唇时，她伸出双臂环绕住她忠贞的母亲的脖颈，哭了起来，就像以前多次经历的儿时哀伤一样，只是这次的哀伤更加深沉，更加悲惨。"

"I only know that, if the cottage be hidden in a green hollow of the hills, every sound of sorrow in the whole upland is heard there—every call of suffering or of sickness for help is listened to by a sad, gentle-looking woman, who rarely smiles (and when she does her smile is more sad than other people’s tears), but who comes out of her seclusion whenever there is a shadow in any household.","我知道的只有这些，如果茅屋隐藏在绿色的山谷中，那么在整个高地的每一个悲伤的声音都会被听到——每一声痛苦或疾病的呼唤都会被一个伤心的、相貌温和的女人听到，她很少有笑容出现（当她笑的时候，她的笑容比别人的眼泪还要悲伤），每当有家庭出现阴影的时候，她就会从她的幽居中走出来。"
