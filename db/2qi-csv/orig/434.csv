"Our Letters","我们的信"
"by Guy de Maupassant","作者：莫泊桑"
"Eight hours of railway travel induce sleep for some persons and insomnia for others with me, any journey prevents my sleeping on the following night.","八个小时的火车旅程，有些人会昏昏入睡，有些人则会失眠。至于我，任何旅程都会让我在第二天晚上难以入睡。"
"At about five o’clock I arrived at the estate of Abelle, which belongs to my friends, the Murets d’Artus, to spend three weeks there.","5点钟左右，我到达阿贝尔庄园，这是我的朋友穆雷·德阿图斯夫妇的家。我将在那里度过三个星期。"
"It is a pretty house, built by one of their grandfathers in the style of the latter half of the last century.","这是一座漂亮的房屋，是他们的一位先祖建造的，带有上个世纪下半叶的风格。"
"Therefore it has that intimate character of dwellings that have always been inhabited, furnished and enlivened by the same people.","因此同一批人居住在这里，布置家具，使它富有生气，所以它有那种舒适怡人的住宅的特点。"
"Nothing changes; nothing alters the soul of the dwelling, from which the furniture has never been taken out, the tapestries never unnailed, thus becoming worn out, faded, discolored, on the same walls.","住宅没有什么变动。它的灵魂丝毫没有改变：家具从来没被挪出过；挂毯从来没被取下过，它们在原来的墙上慢慢变旧，发白，褪色。"
"None of the old furniture leaves the place; only from time to time it is moved a little to make room for a new piece, which enters there like a new-born infant in the midst of brothers and sisters.","那些旧家具一件也没有少，仅仅是时不时地被挪动一下，来给新家具腾出空间；新家具进入这里，就像新生儿加入到哥哥姐姐们中间一样。"
"The house is on a hill in the center of a park which slopes down to the river, where there is a little stone bridge.","房子坐落在一座山丘上，在一片园林的中间。园林沿着山坡一直倾斜到有座小石桥横跨其上的小河边。"
"Beyond the water the fields stretch out in the distance, and here one can see the cows wandering around, pasturing on the moist grass; their eyes seem full of the dew, mist and freshness of the pasture.","河对面是一片广阔的牧场。从这里你可以看见在草地上漫步的奶牛。它们品尝着湿润的青草，眼睛里似乎充满露水、薄雾和牧草的清爽。"
"I love this dwelling, just as one loves a thing which one ardently desires to possess.","我喜爱这个庄园，就像一个人热爱着他强烈渴望得到的东西一样。"
"I return here every autumn with infinite delight; I leave with regret.","每年秋天，我都会带着无限欣喜回到这里，离开时又万分不舍。"
"After I had dined with this friendly family, by whom I was received like a relative, I asked my friend, Paul Muret: “Which room did you give me this year?”","这个友好的家庭像亲人一样招待了我。和他们吃过晚饭后，我问我的好友保罗·穆雷：“今年你给我安排了哪个房间呢？”"
"“Aunt Rose’s room.”","“罗丝姑妈的房间。”"
"An hour later, followed by her three children, two little girls and a boy, Madame Muret d’Artus installed me in Aunt Rose’s room, where I had not yet slept.","一个小时后，穆雷·德阿图斯夫人，后面跟着她的三个孩子——两个女孩和一个男孩，把我安置到罗丝姑妈的房间，我从来没有在这个房间住过。"
"When I was alone I examined the walls, the furniture, the general aspect of the room, in order to attune my mind to it.","当我独自一人时，我就观察起墙壁、家具和房屋的大体面貌，以便让我的心在这里安定下来。"
"I knew it but little, as I had entered it only once or twice, and I looked indifferently at a pastel portrait of Aunt Rose, who gave her name to the room.","我知道这个房间，但不是很熟悉，因为我只进来过一两次。我漫不经心地打量起罗丝姑妈的粉蜡肖像，这个房间就是以她的名字命名的。"
"This old Aunt Rose, with her curls, looking at me from behind the glass, made very little impression on my mind.","这个卷发的老罗丝姑妈，从玻璃后面看着我，丝毫引不起我的兴趣。"
"She looked to me like a woman of former days, with principles and precepts as strong on the maxims of morality as on cooking recipes, one of these old aunts who are the bugbear of gaiety and the stern and wrinkled angel of provincial families.","对我来说，她看起来就像是从前那种凡事讲原则讲信条、对道德标准和烹饪菜谱都很熟知的妇女，那种乡下家庭里会把快乐吓跑、性情苛刻又满脸皱纹的老姑妈。"
"I never had heard her spoken of; I knew nothing of her life or of her death.","我从未听人提起过她，对于她的生前和死后的情况，我也一无所知。"
"Did she belong to this century or to the preceding one?","她是这个世纪的人还是上个世纪的人？"
"Had she left this earth after a calm or a stormy existence?","她是在度过了平淡的一生还是动荡的一生离开这个世界的？"
"Had she given up to heaven the pure soul of an old maid, the calm soul of a spouse, the tender one of a mother, or one moved by love?","她还给上苍的是老姑娘纯洁的灵魂、妻子平静的心灵、母亲温柔的心灵，还是为爱情激动的灵魂？"
"What difference did it make?","这又有什么关系呢？"
"The name alone, “Aunt Rose,” seemed ridiculous, common, ugly.","罗丝姑妈这个名字本身似乎就显得滑稽、粗俗、令人厌恶。"
"I picked up a candle and looked at her severe face, hanging far up in an old gilt frame.","我端起蜡烛，去看她那高高悬挂在古老镀金相框中的表情严肃的脸庞。"
"Then, as I found it insignificant, disagreeable, even unsympathetic, I began to examine the furniture.","然后我发现她的脸毫无可取之处，不讨人喜欢，甚至引人反感，于是我开始查看家具。"
"It dated from the period of Louis XVI, the Revolution and the Directorate.","那是路易十六时期、革命时期和督政府时期的家具。"
"Not a chair, not a curtain had entered this room since then, and it gave out the subtle odor of memories, which is the combined odor of wood, cloth, chairs, hangings, peculiar to places wherein have lived hearts that have loved and suffered.","从那以后，这个房间再也没有添过一把椅子、一幅窗帘。房间散发着一股回忆的气味，一股微妙的气味——是木头、织布、椅子、门帘的混合气味，尤其是那种有人在这里生活过、爱过、痛过的气味。"
"I retired but did not sleep.","我躺在床上，却睡不着。"
"After I had tossed about for an hour or two, I decided to get up and write some letters.","辗转难眠一两个小时后，我决定起床写几封信。"
"I opened a little mahogany desk with brass trimmings, which was placed between the two windows, in hope of finding some ink and paper; but all I found was a quill-pen, very much worn, and chewed at the end.","我打开放在两扇窗户中间的一张镶有黄铜边的桃花心木写字台，希望能找到墨水和纸。但是，我只找到一支用得很旧，而且笔头有点儿咬坏的翮笔。"
"I was about to close this piece of furniture, when a shining spot attracted my attention it looked like the yellow head of a nail.","我正要关上写字台抽屉，一个闪光的亮点引起了我的注意。它看起来像一个黄色的钉子头。"
"I scratched it with my finger, and it seemed to move.","我用手指头扒了扒，它似乎动了动。"
"I seized it between two finger-nails, and pulled as hard as I could.","我用两根指头捏住它，使劲往外拔。"
"It came toward me gently.","慢慢地我把它拔了出来。"
"It was a long gold pin which had been slipped into a hole in the wood and remained hidden there.","这是一根长长的大头金针，插在木头上的一个小洞里，一直藏在那里。"
"Why?","这是怎么回事？"
"I immediately thought that it must have served to work some spring which hid a secret, and I looked.","我立即想到它一定是用来拨动一个藏有秘密的弹簧，于是我开始四处找。"
"It took a long time.","这花了很长时间。"
"After about two hours of investigation, I discovered another hole opposite the first one, but at the bottom of a groove.","经过大约两个小时的研究，我发现在第一个小洞的对面还有一个小洞，但是在一条凹槽里面。"
"Into this I stuck my pin: a little shelf sprang toward my face, and I saw two packages of yellow letters, tied with a blue ribbon.","我把大头针插进去，一个小木板朝我的脸弹过来，我看见两捆用蓝丝带系着的、颜色发黄的信。"
"I read them.","我读了这些信。"
"Here are two of them:","下面是其中的两封："
"So you wish me to return to you your letters, my dearest friend.","这么说，你是希望我把你的信件还给你，我最心爱的朋友。"
"Here they are, but it pains me to obey.","它们都在这里，但是这样做让我很心痛。"
"Of what are you afraid?","你在害怕什么呢？"
"That I might lose them?","害怕我可能丢失它们？"
"But they are under lock and key.","但是它们都锁得好好的。"
"Do you fear that they might be stolen?","你害怕它们被偷？"
"I guard against that, for they are my dearest treasure.","我保证不会，因为它们是我最珍贵的财宝。"
"Yes, it pains me deeply.","是的，这深深地伤害了我。"
"I wondered whether, perhaps you might not be feeling some regret!","我在想，也许你并不觉得后悔吧！"
"Not regret at having loved me, for I know that you still do, but the regret of having expressed on white paper this living love in hours when your heart did not confide in me, but in the pen that you held in your hand.","不是后悔你爱过我，因为我知道你仍然爱着我，而是后悔你的心不是向我敞开，却花费几个小时，用你握在手里的笔将这份浓烈的爱写在纸上表达出来。"
"When we love, we have need of confession, need of talking or writing, and we either talk or write.","当我们相爱时，我们需要相互倾诉，需要用嘴说出或用笔写下来深情，于是我们就用嘴说出来，或者用笔写下来。"
"Words fly away, those sweet words made of music, air and tenderness, warm and light, which escape as soon as they are uttered, which remain in the memory alone, but which one can neither see, touch nor kiss, as one can with the words written by your hand.","言语会消失，那些由音乐、空气和挚爱组成的温暖又轻柔的甜言蜜语一说出口就不见了，它们只能留存在记忆中。但是，你亲手写下的那些话语，我能看见它们、抚摸它们、亲吻它们。"
"Your letters?","你的信？"
"Yes, I am returning them to you!","好吧，我把它们还给你！"
"But with what sorrow!","但是我是多么伤心啊！"
"Undoubtedly, you must have had an after thought of delicate shame at expressions that are ineffaceable.","可以肯定，你事后肯定为表达出那些无法抹去的话语感到深深羞愧。"
"In your sensitive and timid soul you must have regretted having written to a man that you loved him. You remembered sentences that called up recollections, and you said to yourself: “I will make ashes of those words.”","在你敏感又胆怯的心里，你一定后悔曾写信给一个男人说你爱他。你想起那些勾起回忆的句子，然后对自己说：“我要把这些话化为灰烬。”"
"Be satisfied, be calm.","满意吧，放心吧。"
"Here are your letters.","你的信都在这儿。"
"I love you.","我爱你。"
"MY FRIEND:","我亲爱的："
"No, you have not understood me, you have not guessed.","不，你没理解我，你没猜中我的想法。"
"I do not regret, and I never shall, that I told you of my affection.","我没有后悔，而且永远也不会后悔跟你倾诉我对你的爱。"
"I will always write to you, but you must return my letters to me as soon as you have read them.","我会一直给你写信，但是你读完信后就必须马上还给我。"
"I shall shock you, my friend, when I tell you the reason for this demand.","亲爱的，如果我告诉你这个请求的原因，你一定会感到惊讶的。"
"It is not poetic, as you imagined, but practical.","这不是如你想象的那样诗意，而是很实际的。"
"I am afraid, not of you, but of some mischance.","我害怕，但不是害怕你，而是害怕不幸。"
"I am guilty.","我是有罪的。"
"I do not wish my fault to affect others than myself.","我不希望我的错误影响到除我以外的其他人。"
"Understand me well.","好好理解我吧！"
"You and I may both die.","你和我都可能会死去。"
"You might fall off your horse, since you ride every day; you might die from a sudden attack, from a duel, from heart disease, from a carriage accident, in a thousand ways.","或许你会从马上摔下，因为你每天都骑马；或许你会死于中风、决斗、心脏病、车祸等等，有上千种的死法。"
"For, if there is only one death, there are more ways of its reaching us than there are days or us to live.","因为虽然死亡只有一次，但怎么个死法却比我们活下去的日子要多得多。"
"Then your sisters, your brother, or your sister-in-law might find my letters!","到那时，你的姐姐，你的哥哥，或者你的嫂子也许会发现我的信。"
"Do you think that they love me?","你觉得他们喜欢我吗？"
"I doubt it.","我觉得不会。"
"And then, even if they adored me, is it possible for two women and one man to know a secret—such a secret!—and not to tell of it?","再说，即使他们喜欢我，两个女人和一个男人知道一个秘密——一个像这样的秘密，他们有可能会不讲出来吗？"
"I seem to be saying very disagreeable things, speaking first of your death, and then suspecting the discreetness of your relatives.","我似乎在讲一些令人很不愉快的事，先讲到你的死，又怀疑你家人能否言行谨慎。"
"But don’t all of us die sooner or later?","但是我们迟早有一天会死的，不是吗？"
"And it is almost certain that one of us will precede the other under the ground.","并且几乎可以确定的是，我们两人中必然有一个比另一个先长眠地下。"
"We must therefore foresee all dangers, even that one.","因此我们必须预见到所有危险，甚至是这样一个危险。"
"As for me, I will keep your letters beside mine, in the secret of my little desk.","至于我，我会把你的信放在我的信旁边，藏在我小写字台的暗屉里。"
"I will show them to you there, sleeping side by side in their silken hiding place, full of our love, like lovers in a tomb.","我会让你看着它们并肩躺着，充满我们的爱，像一对躺在坟墓里的情人一样，藏在丝绸里面。"
"You will say to me: “But if you should die first, my dear, your husband will find these letters.”","你对我说：“可是如果你先死了，亲爱的，你的丈夫会找到这些信的。”"
"Oh!","啊！"
"I fear nothing.","我什么都不怕。"
"First of all, he does not know the secret of my desk, and then he will not look for it.","首先，他不知道我写字台里有暗屉，也不会去找它。"
"And even if he finds it after my death, I fear nothing.","即使在我死后，他发现了，我也什么都不怕。"
"Did you ever stop to think of all the love letters that have been found after death?","你曾经想过那些在死后被发现的情书吗？"
"I have been thinking of this for a long time, and that is the reason I decided to ask you for my letters.","关于这个，我已经想过很长一段时间了，并且这是我决定向你要回我的信的原因。"
"Think that never, do you understand, never, does a woman burn, tear or destroy the letters in which it is told her that she is loved.","想想你也明白，一个女人永远不会烧掉、撕掉或毁掉那些告诉自己被爱着的信。"
"That is our whole life, our whole hope, expectation and dream.","那是我们的全部生命，我们所有的希望、期盼和梦想。"
"These little papers which bear our name in caressing terms are relics which we adore; they are chapels in which we are the saints.","这些小小的信纸上面有我们的名字，爱抚着我们。它们是我们珍视的圣物，它们就像教堂，我们是教堂里面的圣徒。"
"Our love letters are our titles to beauty, grace, seduction, the intimate vanity of our womanhood; they are the treasures of our heart.","我们的情书是我们美丽、优雅和魅力的证明，是我们女性内心的骄傲，是我们心中的珍宝。"
"No, a woman does not destroy these secret and delicious archives of her life.","不，一个女人不会毁掉她生命中那些隐秘而又美妙的档案。"
"But, like everybody else, we die, and then—then these letters are found!","但是，像每个人一样，我们会死，然后这些信件会被发现！"
"Who finds them?","会被谁发现呢？"
"The husband.","丈夫。"
"Then what does he do?","那么他会做什么呢？"
"Nothing. He burns them.","什么也不做，他会毁掉它们。"
"Oh, I have thought a great deal about that!","啊，关于这些我已想过很多！"
"Just think that every day women are dying who have been loved; every day the traces and proofs of their fault fall into the hands of their husbands, and that there is never a scandal, never a duel.","只需想想，每天都有被爱过的女人死去，每天都有她们过失的痕迹和证据落入丈夫的手中，但是从来没有暴露过一桩丑闻，引发过一次决斗。"
"Think, my dear, of what a man’s heart is.","我亲爱的，想想吧，男人的心是怎样的。"
"He avenges himself on a living woman; he fights with the man who has dishonored her, kills him while she lives, because, well, why?","他会为一个活着的女人报复，会跟一个令她蒙羞的男人决斗，会在她活着的时候杀死那个男人。因为，是的，因为什么呢？"
"I do not know exactly why.","我不清楚到底是为什么。"
"But, if, after her death, he finds similar proofs, he burns them and no one is the wiser, and he continues to shake hands with the friend of the dead woman, and feels quite at ease that these letters should not have fallen into strange hands, and that they are destroyed.","但是如果是在她死后才发现这些类似的证据，他会烧掉并假装什么都不知道，继续和死者的情夫握手，为这些信没有落入外人的手里并已毁掉而感到踏实。"
"Oh, how many men I know among my friends who must have burned such proofs, and who pretend to know nothing, and yet who would have fought madly had they found them when she was still alive!","啊，我知道在我的朋友中有很多这样的男人，他们烧掉证据，假装什么都不知道。但如果是在她活着的时候发现这些信，这些男人一定会狂怒。"
"But she is dead.","但是她已经死了。"
"Honor has changed.","荣誉已经变了。"
"The tomb is the boundary of conjugal sinning.","坟墓将夫妻恩怨一笔勾销。"
"Therefore, I can safely keep our letters, which, in your hands, would be a menace to both of us. Do you dare to say that I am not right?","因此，我可以很安全地保管我们的信，而如果这些信在你的手中，对我们两个都是威胁。你敢说我说得不对吗？"
"I love you and kiss you.","我爱你，吻你。"
"I raised my eyes to the portrait of Aunt Rose, and as I looked at her severe, wrinkled face, I thought of all those women’s souls which we do not know, and which we suppose to be so different from what they really are, whose inborn and ingenuous craftiness we never can penetrate, their quiet duplicity; and a verse of De Vigny returned to my memory:","我抬起双眼去看罗丝姑妈的肖像。当看到她那严肃而又满脸皱纹的脸庞时，我想起所有这些我们不了解的女人的心灵。她们的真实情况与我们认为的完全不同，她们与生俱来的、天真的狡诈和心安理得的欺骗，我们从来都未能洞察。我想起德维尼的一句诗："
"“Always this comrade whose heart is uncertain.”","“永远，这个伴侣，心不定。”"
