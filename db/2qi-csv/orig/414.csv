"The Cunning Hare","聪明的兔子"
"by Andrew Lang","作者：安德鲁·朗格"
"In a very cold country, far across the seas, where ice and snow cover the ground for many months in the year, there lived a little hare, who, as his father and mother were both dead, was brought up by his grandmother.","在遥远的海洋彼岸，有一个非常寒冷的村庄，那里一年内有好几个月被冰雪覆盖。村庄里住着一只小兔子，他的爸爸和妈妈都去世了，是由他的祖母抚养大的。"
"As he was too young, and she was too old, to work, they were very poor, and often did not have enough to eat.","由于他太年幼，而她过于年长，他们都不能劳作，所以他们很贫穷，而且经常挨饿。"
"One day, when the little fellow was hungrier than usual, he asked his grandmother if he might go down to the river and catch a fish for their breakfast, as the thaw had come and the water was flowing freely again.","有一天，小兔子感到比平时还要饥饿，他询问祖母自己是否可以去下面的河流抓条鱼当作他们的早餐，因为河里的冰雪已经融化，河水又开始自由地流淌。"
"She laughed at him for thinking that any fish would let itself be caught by a hare, especially such a young one; but as she had the rheumatism very badly, and could get no food herself, she let him go.","祖母笑了笑，心想哪有鱼会被一只兔子抓到，尤其是一只这么年幼的兔子；但是因为她有非常严重的风湿病，自己不能去寻找食物，于是她同意了小兔子的请求。"
"‘If he does not catch a fish he may find something else,’ she said to herself.","“如果他抓不到鱼，他还可以找点儿别的东西。”她自言自语道。"
"So she told her grandson where to look for the net, and how he was to set it across the river; but just as he was starting, feeling himself quite a man, she called him back.","所以，她告诉孙子去哪里寻找渔网以及怎样在河上铺设渔网；但就在小兔子感觉自己像个大人，准备出发时，祖母把他叫了回来。"
"‘After all, I don’t know what is the use of your going, my boy!","“其实，我觉得你根本就是白跑一趟，我的孩子！"
"For even if you should catch a fish, I have no fire to cook it with.’","即使你抓到了鱼，我也没有火来烹调它。”"
"‘Let me catch my fish, and I will soon make you a fire,’ he answered gaily, for he was young, and knew nothing about the difficulties of fire-making.","“让我去抓鱼，回来我马上为您生火。”他开心地回答道，因为他太年轻了，而且根本不知道要生起火来有多么困难。"
"It took him some time to haul the net through bushes and over fields, but at length he reached a pool in the river which he had often heard was swarming with fish, and here he set the net, as his grandmother had directed him.","他花了好长时间将渔网拖过灌木丛和田地，最终到达了河里的一处池塘，因为他过去总听说这里有成群的鱼，于是就按着祖母告诉他的方法把渔网安置在了这里。"
"He was so excited that he hardly slept all night, and at the very first streak of dawn he ran as fast as ever he could down to the river.","小兔子太兴奋了，整晚都没睡着，等到第二天曙光初露的时候，他以最快的速度跑到了河边。"
"His heart beat as quickly as if he had had dogs behind him, and he hardly dared to look, lest he should be disappointed.","他的心怦怦直跳，好像后面有狗在追他一样，同时也不敢看网里是否有鱼，害怕失望。"
"Would there be even one fish?","渔网里会有一条鱼吗？"
"And at this thought the pangs of hunger made him feel quite sick with fear.","一想到这里，饥饿感就使他害怕得不得了。"
"But he need not have been afraid; in every mesh of the net was a fine fat fish, and of course the net itself was so heavy that he could only lift one corner.","但是他不需要害怕；在每个网眼上都有一条新鲜的肥鱼，当然网本身就很重，他只能举起一角。"
"He threw some of the fish back into the water, and buried some more in a hole under a stone, where he would be sure to find them.","他把一些鱼扔回了水里，又把一些鱼埋在了一块石头下面的洞里，这样他肯定能找到它们。"
"Then he rolled up the net with the rest, put it on his back and carried it home.","之后，他把剩下的鱼用渔网包起来，放在肩上扛回了家。"
"The weight of the load caused his back to ache, and he was thankful to drop it outside their hut, while he rushed in, full of joy, to tell his grandmother.","鱼太重了，他的背都疼了，令人欣慰的是，他终于到了家，把背上的东西扔在了屋子外面，满心欢喜地冲进了屋子，要把这件事告诉祖母。"
"‘Be quick and clean them!’ he said, ‘and I will go to those people’s tents on the other side of the water.’","“快点儿把它们清理干净！”他说，“我要去河对岸那些人的帐篷去。”"
"The old woman stared at him in horror as she listened to his proposal.","听到这一提议，这位老妇人惊恐地看着他。"
"Other people had tried to steal fire before, and few indeed had come back with their lives; but as, contrary to all her expectations, he had managed to catch such a number of fish, she thought that perhaps there was some magic about him which she did not know of, and did not try to hinder him.","之前有人尝试去盗火，但是实际上很少有人活着回来；但是与她的预期相反，他成功捕获了这么多鱼，她认为可能是孙子有自己不知道的一些魔力，也就没试图阻止他。"
"When the fish were all taken out, he fetched the net which he had laid out to dry, folded it up very small, and ran down to the river, hoping that he might find a place narrow enough for him to jump over; but he soon saw that it was too wide for even the best jumper in the world.","当把这些鱼都拿出来以后，小兔子把网取回铺平晒干，折成很小的一块，然后跑到河边，希望能找到一块足够狭窄的地方让自己跳过去；但是很快他就发现这个地方太宽了，即使是世界上最好的跳跃者也跳不过去。"
"For a few moments he stood there, wondering what was to be done, then there darted into his head some words of a spell which he had once heard a wizard use, while drinking from the river.","他在那里站了一会儿，思考应该怎么办，脑子里突然闪现出他过去听过一个在河边喝水的男巫念过的几句咒语。"
"He repeated them, as well as he could remember, and waited to see what would happen.","他凭记忆不断地重复那些咒语，等待着将有什么事情发生。"
"In five minutes such a grunting and a puffing was heard, and columns of water rose into the air, though he could not tell what had made them.","五分钟之后，就听到了咕咕声和噗噗声，紧接着，一道道的水柱冲向天空，可是他并不知道为什么会出现这种情景。"
"Then round the bend of the stream came fifteen huge whales, which he ordered to place themselves heads to tails, like stepping stones, so that he could jump from one to the other till he landed on the opposite shore.","在水流的弯曲处出现了15头巨大的鲸鱼，小兔子让它们首尾排列，这样他就可以像踩着跳板一样，从它们上面一个接一个地跳过去，到达对岸。"
"Directly he got there he told the whales that he did not need them any more, and sat down in the sand to rest.","一到了对岸，他就告诉那些鲸鱼自己不再需要它们了，然后他就坐在河滩上休息。"
"Unluckily some children who were playing about caught sight of him, and one of them, stealing softly up behind him, laid tight hold of his ears.","倒霉的是，一些正在玩耍的孩子看见了他，其中一个孩子悄悄地从后面偷袭他，紧紧地抓住了他的耳朵。"
"The hare, who had been watching the whales as they sailed down the river, gave a violent start, and struggled to get away; but the boy held on tight, and ran back home, as fast as he could go.","兔子当时在看鲸鱼顺流而下，突然浑身一抖，想要逃脱出去；但是小男孩紧紧地抓住了他，并以最快的速度跑回了家。"
"‘Throw it in the pot,’ said the old woman, as soon as he had told his story; ‘put it in that basket, and as soon as the water boils in the pot we will hang it over the fire!’","到家后，小男孩讲他逮到兔子的话音刚落，一个老太太便说道：“把它扔进锅里，先放进篮子里，等锅里的水一烧开，我们就把它吊起来在火上烤！”"
"‘Better kill it first,’ said the old man; and the hare listened, horribly frightened, but still looking secretly to see if there was no hole through which he could escape, if he had a chance of doing so.","“最好先杀了它。”一个老头说；兔子听到这些话后害怕极了，但他还在悄悄地寻找是否有一个能逃出去的洞，如果他有机会这样做的话。"
"Yes, there was one, right in the top of the tent, so, shaking himself, as if with fright, he let the end of his net unroll itself a little.","是的，这里有一个洞，就在帐篷的顶部，于是，他抖动了一下，看起来像受到惊吓一样，让网的末端稍微松一下。","稍微松一些"
"‘I wish that a spark of fire would fall on my net,’ whispered he; and the next minute a great log fell forward into the midst of the tent, causing every one to spring backwards.","“我希望能有一点儿火花落在我的网上。”他小声说道；紧接着一块巨大的圆木掉进了帐篷中，大家都向后跳去。"
"The sparks were scattered in every direction, and one fell on the net, making a little blaze.","火花朝四处散开，有一点儿火星溅到了网上，着了起来。"
"In an instant the hare had leaped through the hole, and was racing towards the river, with men, women, and children after him.","兔子马上从那个洞跳了出来，朝河的方向奔去，男人、女人和小孩都在后面追他。"
"There was no time to call back the whales, so, holding the net tight in his mouth, he wished himself across the river.","已经没有时间叫回鲸鱼了，因此，他紧紧地咬住嘴里的网，希望自己能够跳过这条河。"
"Then he jumped high into the air, and landed safe on the other side, and after turning round to be sure that there was no chance of anyone pursuing him, trotted happily home to his grandmother.","他朝天空高高地跳起，安全地落在了河的对岸，接着他转过身确认后面没有人可以追上他之后，便开心地跑回家去找他的祖母了。"
"‘Didn’t I tell you I would bring you fire?’ said he, holding up his net, which was now burning briskly.","“我不是之前告诉过您我会带回火种的吗？”他说，举起他的网子，上面的火此刻烧得正旺。"
"‘But how did you cross the water?’ inquired the old woman.","“但你是怎么穿过了那条河的呢？”祖母问道。"
"‘Oh, I just jumped!’ said he.","“哦，我一跳就过去了！”他说。"
"And his grandmother asked him no more questions, for she saw that he was wiser than she.","他的祖母没有再继续问问题，因为她知道孙子要比自己聪明。"
