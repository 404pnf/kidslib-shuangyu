"A Sale","一笔买卖"
"by Guy de Maupassant","作者：莫泊桑"
"The defendants, Cesaire-Isidore Brument and Prosper-Napoleon Cornu, appeared before the Court of Assizes of the Seine-Inferieure, on a charge of attempted murder, by drowning, of Mme. Brument, lawful wife of the first of the aforenamed.","被告塞泽尔—伊西多尔·布吕芒和普罗斯珀—拿破仑·科尔尼（，因被指控企图淹死布吕芒太太（第一个被告的合法妻子）而在塞纳省下属的巡回审判法庭出庭受审。"
"The two prisoners sat side by side on the traditional bench.","这两个被告肩并肩地坐在被告一贯坐的长凳上。"
"They were two peasants; the first was small and stout, with short arms, short legs, and a round head with a red pimply face, planted directly on his trunk, which was also round and short, and with apparently no neck.","他们都是农民。布吕芒是个矮小的胖子，短胳膊短腿的，圆圆的脑袋，红红的脸上满是疙瘩。这张脸就像是直接安在他那又圆又短的身体上，他就好像没有脖子似的。"
"He was a raiser of pigs and lived at Cacheville-la-Goupil, in the district of Criquetot.","他是养猪的，住在克里克托地区的加什维尔—拉古比西村。"
"Cornu (Prosper-Napoleon) was thin, of medium height, with enormously long arms.","科尔尼（普罗斯珀—拿破仑）是个瘦子，中等身材，手臂却长得惊人。"
"His head was on crooked, his jaw awry, and he squinted.","他的头有点儿歪，下巴也一样，而且眼睛还斜视。"
"A blue blouse, as long as a shirt, hung down to his knees, and his yellow hair, which was scanty and plastered down on his head, gave his face a worn-out, dirty look, a dilapidated look that was frightful.","他身上那件蓝罩衫，长得和衬衣一样，一直拖到膝盖上；稀疏的黄发紧搭在头顶上，使他那张脸显得疲惫不堪，龌龊邋遢，丑得吓人。"
"He had been nicknamed “the cure” because he could imitate to perfection the chanting in church, and even the sound of the serpent.","人们给他起了个“本堂神父”的绰号，因为他学唱教堂的圣歌学得很像，甚至还能模仿撒旦的声音。"
"This talent attracted to his cafe—for he was a saloon keeper at Criquetot—a great many customers who preferred the “mass at Cornu” to the mass in church.","他是克里克托一间酒吧的老板，他的这种才能吸引了一大批顾客；与天主的弥撒相比，这些顾客更喜欢“科尔尼的弥撒”。"
"Mme. Brument, seated on the witness bench, was a thin peasant woman who seemed to be always asleep.","布吕芒太太坐在证人席上。她是个瘦瘦的农村妇女，看起来总是满脸睡意。"
"She sat there motionless, her hands crossed on her knees, gazing fixedly before her with a stupid expression.","她坐在那里一动不动，双手交叉着放在膝盖上，眼睛紧盯着前方，目光呆滞。"
"The judge continued his interrogation.","法官继续审问道："
"“Well, then, Mme. Brument, they came into your house and threw you into a barrel full of water.","“那么说，布吕芒太太，他们闯进您家里，把您扔进一个装满水的大桶里。"
"Tell us the details.","请把具体情况告诉我们。"
"Stand up.”","同时也请站起来。”"
"She rose.","她站起来了。"
"She looked as tall as a flag pole with her cap which looked like a white skull cap.","她看起来跟旗杆一样高，头上戴着一顶像白颅骨盖的帽子。"
"She said in a drawling tone:","她慢吞吞地说道："
"“I was shelling beans.","“我正在剥豆子。"
"Just then they came in.","就在那时，他们进来了。"
"I said to myself, ‘What is the matter with them?","我心里嘀咕：‘他们想干什么？"
"They do not seem natural, they seem up to some mischief.’ They watched me sideways, like this, especially Cornu, because he squints.","怎么他们看起来不太自然，似乎不怀好意。’他们像这样斜着眼睛看我，特别是科尔尼，因为他是斜视眼。"
"I do not like to see them together, for they are two good-for-nothings when they are in company.","我不喜欢看他们两个在一起，因为他们在一起就像两个废物一样，一无是处。"
"I said: ‘What do you want with me?’ They did not answer.","于是我对他们说：‘你们想要我干什么？’他们没有回答。"
"I had a sort of mistrust——”","我心里就有些怀疑……”"
"The defendant Brument interrupted the witness hastily, saying:","被告布吕芒匆忙打断她，说道："
"“I was full.”","“当时我是喝多了。”"
"Then Cornu, turning towards his accomplice said in the deep tones of an organ:","这时，科尔尼转向他的同谋，用低沉的声音说道："
"“Say that we were both full, and you will be telling no lie.”","“应该说我们两个人都喝多了，这样才算说了实话。”"
"The judge, severely:","法官严肃地说道："
"“You mean by that that you were both drunk?”","“你是说，你们两人都喝醉了？”"
"Brument: “There can be no question about it.”","布吕芒答道：“千真万确。”"
"Cornu: “That might happen to anyone.”","科尔尼说：“这种事谁都会碰到。”"
"The judge to the victim: “Continue your testimony, woman Brument.”","法官对受害者说道：“继续您的陈述，布吕芒太太。”"
"“Well, Brument said to me, ‘Do you wish to earn a hundred sous?’ ‘Yes,’ I replied, seeing that a hundred sous are not picked up in a horse’s tracks.","“好的，法官。布吕芒对我说：‘想不想赚100个苏？’我答道：‘想。’因为100个苏不是那么容易就能赚到的。"
"Then he said: ‘Open your eyes and do as I do,’ and he went to fetch the large empty barrel which is under the rain pipe in the corner, and he turned it over and brought it into my kitchen, and stuck it down in the middle of the floor, and then he said to me: ‘Go and fetch water until it is full.’","然后他对我说：‘看仔细了，照我这样做。’接着他走到一个角落，把雨水管下的一只大空桶打翻，把它滚到我的厨房里，再把它立在厨房中央，然后对我说：‘去挑水，把桶给我装满。’"
"“So I went to the pond with two pails and carried water, and still more water for an hour, seeing that the barrel was as large as a vat, saving your presence, m’sieu le president.","“于是我就提着两只桶到池塘边提水，提了一回又一回，花了个把小时才把水桶装满，因为这只桶大得像大水缸一样。请别见怪，法官大人。"
"“All this time Brument and Cornu were drinking a glass, and then another glass, and then another.","“在这期间，布吕芒和科尔尼都在喝酒，喝了一杯又一杯。"
"They were finishing their drinks when I said to them: ‘You are full, fuller than this barrel.’ And Brument answered me. ‘Do not worry, go on with your work, your turn will come, each one has his share.’ I paid no attention to what he said as he was full.","等他们快喝完的时候，我对他们说：‘你们都已经把自己灌满了，比这只桶还满。’这时布吕芒回答我说：‘别心急，继续去提你的水，会轮到你的，每个人都有份。’那时他已经醉了，我就没在意他说的话。"
"“When the barrel was full to the brim, I said: ‘There, that’s done.’","“当水满到桶口时，我就说：‘水已经装满了。’"
"“And then Cornu gave me a hundred sous, not Brument, Cornu; it was Cornu gave them to me.","“然后科尔尼就给了我100个苏。不是布吕芒，是科尔尼给我的。"
"And Brument said: ‘Do you wish to earn a hundred sous more?’ ‘Yes,’ I said, for I am not accustomed to presents like that.","这时，布吕芒对我说：‘想不想再赚100个苏？’我说：‘想。’因为我不是经常能得到这样的礼物的。"
"Then he said: ’Take off your clothes!","然后他就对我说：‘把衣服给我脱了！’"
"“‘Take off my clothes?’","“‘把衣服脱掉？’"
"“‘Yes,’ he said.","“‘是的。’他对我说。"
"“‘How many shall I take off?’","“‘要我脱几件？’"
"“‘If it worries you at all, keep on your chemise, that won’t bother us.’","“如果你觉得不自在，就把内衣留着吧，那不碍我们的事。’"
"“A hundred sous is a hundred sous, and I have to undress myself; but I did not fancy undressing before those two good-for-nothings.","“哪怕我有多么不想在这两个废物面前脱衣服，但100个苏可不是个小数目，我只有勉强自己脱了衣服。"
"I took off my cap, and then my jacket, and then my skirt, and then my sabots.","我摘掉帽子，然后脱掉我的短上衣，再脱掉我的裙子，最后脱下我的木鞋。"
"Brument said, ‘Keep on your stockings, also; we are good fellows.’","布吕芒对我说：‘把袜子留着吧，我们也是讲道理的。’"
"“And Cornu said, too, ‘We are good fellows.’","“科尔尼也说：‘我们是讲道理的。’"
"“So there I was, almost like mother Eve.","“就这样，我脱得几乎就像我们的母亲夏娃一样（差点儿就一丝不挂了）。"
"And they got up from their chairs, but could not stand straight, they were so full, saving your presence, M’sieu le president.","于是，他们站了起来，但因为喝了很多酒，两个人都站不稳，请别见怪，法官大人。"
"“I said to myself: ‘What are they up to?’","“我心想：‘他们又想使什么坏招？’"
"“And Brument said: ‘Are you ready?’","“这时布吕芒说：‘准备好了吗？’"
"“And Cornu said: ‘I’m ready!’","“科尔尼就说：‘好了！’"
"“And then they took me, Brument by the head, and Cornu by the feet, as one might take, for instance, a sheet that has been washed.","“然后他们把我抓住，布吕芒抓头，科尔尼抓脚，就像抓着一条洗过的床单一样。"
"Then I began to bawl.","然后我就大叫起来。"
"“And Brument said: ‘Keep still, wretched creature!’","“布吕芒就对我说：‘给我安静点儿，贱货！’"
"“And they lifted me up in the air and put me into the barrel, which was full of water, so that I had a check of the circulation, a chill to my very insides.","“接着他们把我抬起来，扔进满是水的桶里，我的血一下子就冻住了，冷到了骨子里。"
"“And Brument said: ‘Is that all?’","“布吕芒说道：‘就这样吗？’"
"“Cornu said: ‘That is all.’","“科尔尼答道：‘就这样。’"
"“Brument said: ‘The head is not in, that will make a difference in the measure.’","“布吕芒说：‘脑袋还没进去，这也要算进去的。’"
"“Cornu said: ‘Put in her head.’","“科尔尼说道：‘把她的脑袋按下去。’"
"“And then Brument pushed down my head as if to drown me, so that the water ran into my nose, so that I could already see Paradise.","“然后布吕芒就把我的头按下去，仿佛要把我淹死，水都呛到我的鼻子里了，我几乎就要看到天堂了。"
"And he pushed it down, and I disappeared.","他继续往下按，直到我整个人都浸在水里。"
"“And then he must have been frightened.","“然后他一定是被吓到了。"
"He pulled me out and said: ‘Go and get dry, carcass.’","于是他把我拉起来，说道：‘去，快去擦干身子，死尸。’"
"“As for me, I took to my heels and ran as far as M. le cure’s.","“至于我，我撒腿就跑，一口气跑到本堂神父那儿。"
"He lent me a skirt belonging to his servant, for I was almost in a state of nature, and he went to fetch Maitre Chicot, the country watchman who went to Criquetot to fetch the police who came to my house with me.","本堂神父借了条他女佣的裙子给我，因为我几乎是全裸着，然后他把这里的值班员管家奇科特叫来，奇科特又去克里克托叫来了警察，他们跟我一起去我家里。"
"“Then we found Brument and Cornu fighting each other like two rams.","“然后我们就发现布吕芒跟科尔尼像两头公羊似地厮打在一起。"
"“Brument was bawling: ‘It isn’t true, I tell you that there is at least a cubic metre in it. It is the method that was no good.’","“布吕芒吼叫道：‘那是错的，我告诉你，那至少有一立方米。是这个方法不好。’"
"“Cornu bawled: ‘Four pails, that is almost half a cubic metre.","“科尔尼也叫道：‘四桶水还不到半立方米。"
"You need not reply, that’s what it is.’","你不用说什么了，就是这样。’"
"“The police captain put them both under arrest.","“警察队长把他俩都逮捕了。"
"I have no more to tell.”","陈述完毕。”"
"She sat down.","然后她坐了下来。"
"The audience in the court room laughed.","旁听席上爆发出一阵大笑。"
"The jurors looked at one another in astonishment.","陪审员们诧异地互相看了看。"
"The judge said:","法官大人于是说："
"“Defendant Cornu, you seem to have been the instigator of this infamous plot.","“被告科尔尼，你似乎是这可耻的阴谋诡计的主谋。"
"What have you to say?”","你有什么要辩解的吗？”"
"And Cornu rose in his turn.","轮到科尔尼站起来了。"
"“Judge,” he replied, “I was full.”","“法官大人，”他回答道，“我喝多了。”"
"The Judge answered gravely:","法官大人严肃道："
"“I know it. Proceed.”","“我知道。接着往下讲。”"
"“I will.","“我会的。"
"Well, Brument came to my place about nine o‘clock, and ordered two drinks, and said: ’There’s one for you, Cornu.’ I sat down opposite him and drank, and out of politeness, I offered him a glass.","嗯，布吕芒九点钟左右来到我的店里，要了两瓶酒。然后对我说：‘科尔尼，这杯给你。’我就坐到他的对面，喝了起来。出于礼貌，我也敬了他一杯。"
"Then he returned the compliment and so did I, and so it went on from glass to glass until noon, when we were full.","然后他也回敬了我一杯，接着我又敬了他一杯，就这样你敬我，我敬你，一直喝到中午，那时我们都喝醉了。"
"“Then Brument began to cry.","“这时，布吕芒就哭了起来，"
"That touched me.","这触动了我。"
"I asked him what was the matter.","我就问他怎么了。"
"He said: ‘I must have a thousand francs by Thursday.’ That cooled me off a little, you understand.","他说：‘星期四之前我一定要有1000法郎。’您懂的，这让我冷静了很多。"
"Then he said to me all at once: ‘I will sell you my wife.’","然后，他突然对我说：‘我要把我的妻子卖给你。’"
"“I was full, and I was a widower.","“我喝醉了，再加上我是个离了婚的人。"
"You understand, that stirred me up. I did not know his wife, but she was a woman, wasn’t she?","您知道的，那让我动心了。我不认识他的妻子，但她是个女人，不是吗？"
"I asked him: ‘How much would you sell her for?’","我就问他：‘你要多少钱把她卖给我？’"
"“He reflected, or pretended to reflect.","“他想了一下，或者假装思考了一下。"
"When one is full one is not very clear-headed, and he replied: ‘I will sell her by the cubic metre.’","一个人喝醉了，头脑就不是很清醒。他回答说：‘我按立方米来算把她卖给你。’"
"“That did not surprise me, for I was as drunk as he was, and I knew what a cubic metre is in my business.","“那并不让我惊奇，因为我也喝醉了，而且干我这行的，知道一立方米是什么概念。"
"It is a thousand litres, that suited me.","一立方米等于一千升，那对我来说很合适。"
"“But the price remained to be settled.","“但价格还是要讨论一下的；"
"All depends on the quality.","一切都取决于质量。"
"I said: ‘How much do you want a cubic metre?’","我问他：‘一立方米你要收多少钱？’"
"“He answered: ‘Two thousand francs.’","“他回答说：‘2000法郎。’"
"“I gave a bound like a rabbit, and then I reflected that a woman ought not to measure more than three hundred litres.","“我像兔子那样一下子跳了起来，接着我想了一下，一个女人应该还不到300升。"
"So I said: ‘That’s too dear.’","不过我还是说：‘这太贵了。’"
"“He answered: ‘I cannot do it for less.","“他答道：‘再少，我就不卖了。"
"I should lose by it.’","我会亏本的。’"
"“You understand, one is not a dealer in hogs for nothing.","“您也知道，一个做猪生意的人，也不是白做的。"
"One understands one’s business.","他了解自己的生意。"
"But, if he is smart, the seller of bacon, I am smarter, seeing that I sell them also.","可是，他是个卖熏肉的，如果说他狡猾，那我比他还狡猾，因为我是卖烧酒的。"
"Ha, Ha, Ha!","哈，哈，哈！"
"So I said to him: ‘If she were new, I would not say anything, but she has been married to you for some time, so she is not as fresh as she was.","所以我对他说：‘如果她是新的，那我也没话说，可你已经用过一段时间了，那她就是旧货。"
"I will give you fifteen hundred francs a cubic metre, not a sou more.","我就给你每立方米1500法郎，一个苏也不能再多了。",""," "
"Will that suit you?’","行不？’"
"“He answered: ‘That will do. That’s a bargain!’","“他答道：‘行，成交！’"
"“I agreed, and we started out, arm in arm.","“我同意了，于是我们手挽手地出发了。"
"We must help each other in this world.","在这世上，我们就得互相帮助。"
"“But a fear came to me: ‘How can you measure her unless you put her into the liquid?’","“但我又很担忧：‘不把她放进水里，怎么来测量她？’"
"“Then he explained his idea, not without difficulty for he was full.","“然后，他把他的想法解释给我听，但因为喝醉了，所以费了很大的劲儿。"
"He said to me: ‘I take a barrel, and fill it with water to the brim.","他告诉我说：‘我去弄一只桶，然后把它装满水。"
"I put her in it.","再把她放进去。"
"All the water that comes out we will measure, that is the way to fix it.’","然后我们量一下溢出来的水，就可以了。’"
"“I said: ‘I see, I understand.","“我说：‘我明白了，理解了。"
"But this water that overflows will run away; how are you going to gather it up?’","可是这溢出来的水会流走啊，你怎么把它们收集起来呢？’"
"“Then he began stuffing me and explained to me that all we should have to do would be to refill the barrel with the water his wife had displaced as soon as she should have left.","“然后他就开始糊弄我，解释给我听，说我们要做的就是等他妻子出了水桶，再把桶里少的水补满，"
"All the water we should pour in would be the measure.","然后算一下补进去的水就可以了。"
"I supposed about ten pails; that would be a cubic metre.","我认为会补进去十桶水，那就是一立方米。"
"He isn’t a fool, all the same, when he is drunk, that old horse.","那个混蛋，喝醉了也还那么聪明！"
"“To be brief, we reached his house and I took a look at its mistress.","“简单点儿说，我们到了他家，我仔细瞧了瞧这个女人。"
"A beautiful woman she certainly was not.","当然，她还算不上是个漂亮的女人。"
"Anyone can see her, for there she is.","她就在这儿，大家都看得到。"
"I said to myself: ‘I am disappointed, but never mind, she will be of value; handsome or ugly, it is all the same, is it not, monsieur le president?’ And then I saw that she was as thin as a rail.","我心想：‘我很失望，但没关系，她终归是个女人，不管是漂亮还是丑陋，总是有些价值的，不是吗，法官大人？’而且我也注意到她骨瘦如柴。"
"I said to myself: ’She will not measure four hundred litres.’ I understand the matter, it being in liquids.","我又心想：‘她肯定还不到400升。’因为我是做饮料生意的，我了解这个行情。"
"“She told you about the proceeding.","“后来的事，她都已经告诉您了。"
"I even let her keep on her chemise and stockings, to my own disadvantage.","我甚至还让她穿着内衣和袜子，我吃亏了呀。"
"“When that was done she ran away.","“事情一完，她就跑了。"
"I said: ‘Look out, Brument!","我说：‘当心，布吕芒！"
"she is escaping.’","她逃跑了。’"
"“He replied: ‘Do not be afraid.","“然后他说：‘别怕."
"I will catch her all right.","我当然会去抓住她的。"
"She will have to come back to sleep, I will measure the deficit.’","她肯定得回家过夜的。我去量量缺了多少水。’"
"“We measured.","“我们量了一下："
"Not four pailfuls.","不到四桶水。"
"Ha, Ha, Ha!”","哈哈哈！”"
"The witness began to laugh so persistently that a gendarme was obliged to punch him in the back.","科尔尼开始笑个没完，一个宪兵不得不用力拍了拍他的背。"
"Having quieted down, he resumed:","平静之后，他继续说道："
"“In short, Brument exclaimed: ‘Nothing doing, that is not enough.’ I bawled and bawled, and bawled again, he punched me, I hit back.","“总之，布吕芒大叫道：‘不对，不止这些。’于是我也大叫了起来，他揍我，我也揍他。"
"That would have kept on till the Day of judgment, seeing we were both drunk.","因为我们都喝醉了，我们就吵了起来，要吵到审判日。"
"“Then came the gendarmes!","“然后宪兵就来了！"
"They swore at us, they took us off to prison.","他们骂了我们一顿，把我们送进了监狱。"
"I want damages.”","我要求赔偿。”"
"He sat down.","他坐了下来。"
"Brument confirmed in every particular the statements of his accomplice.","布吕芒证实他的同谋说的都是实话。"
"The jury, in consternation, retired to deliberate.","陪审团在一片惊愕中休庭进行审议。"
"At the end of an hour they returned a verdict of acquittal for the defendants, with some severe strictures on the dignity of marriage, and establishing the precise limitations of business transactions.","一个小时之后，他们回来了，宣告两个被告无罪。严厉提出：既要强调婚姻的尊严，又要明确划清商业交易的界限。"
"Brument went home to the domestic roof accompanied by his wife.","布吕芒在他妻子的陪同下回到他们共同的家。"
"Cornu went back to his business.","科尔尼也回到了他自己的店里。"
