"The Missing Chord","丢失的琴弦"
"by O. Henry","作者：欧·亨利"
"I stopped overnight at the sheep-ranch of Rush Kinney, on the Sandy Fork of the Nueces.","我在拉什·金尼家位于纽埃西斯河桑迪支流的牧羊场留宿了一整夜。"
"Mr. Kinney and I had been strangers up to the time when I called “Hallo!” at his hitching-rack; but from that moment until my departure on the next morning we were, according to the Texas code, undeniable friends.","在我在拴马架旁边向他打招呼之前，我和金尼先生并不认识，但从打招呼那一刻起，一直到第二天早晨我离开前的这段时间内，按照得克萨斯州的礼数，我们绝对已经成了朋友了。"
"After supper the ranchman and I lugged our chairs outside the two-room house, to its floorless gallery roofed with chaparral and sacuista grass.","吃过晚饭，这位牧场主和我拉着我们的椅子走出这套两居室的房子，来到屋外那道没铺地板，却盖着阔叶灌木和茅草的走廊上。"
"With the rear legs of our chairs sinking deep into the hardpacked loam, each of us reposed against an elm pillar of the structure and smoked El Toro tobacco, while we wrangled amicably concerning the affairs of the rest of the world.","椅子的后腿深深陷入结实的沃土中，我俩一人倚着一根榆木支柱，边抽着埃尔托罗香烟，边友善地争论着世界各地的种种事件。"
"As for conveying adequate conception of the engaging charm of that prairie evening, despair waits upon it.","要是你期待有人能充分地描绘出这草原之夜的迷人魅力，肯定是要失望的。"
"It is a bold chronicler who will undertake the description of a Texas night in the early spring.","要是有谁着手描写一个早春的得克萨斯之夜，那这人真是一个大胆的记录者。"
"An inventory must suffice.","我们也只能给出个详细目录。"
"The ranch rested upon the summit of a lenient slope.","牧场坐落于一片宽阔的斜坡顶上。"
"The ambient prairie, diversified by arroyos and murky patches of brush and pear, lay around us like a darkened bowl at the bottom of which we reposed as dregs.","周围的草原上点缀着条条小河和片片阴森森的灌木丛与梨树林，草原就像一口颜色暗淡的大碗，将我们环绕，而我们则像那沉在碗底的饭渣一样。"
"Like a turquoise cover the sky pinned us there.","天空宛如一个绿松石做的碗，把我们罩在里面。"
"The miraculous air, heady with ozone and made memorably sweet by leagues of wild flowerets, gave tang and savour to the breath.","那美妙的空气清新得令人陶醉，又因混合了簇簇野花的芬芳而香甜得令人难忘，给呼吸带来些特别的气息和滋味。"
"In the sky was a great, round, mellow searchlight which we knew to be no moon, but the dark lantern of summer, who came to hunt northward the cowering spring.","一盏浑圆的、光线柔和的巨型探照灯挂在天空中。我们不觉得那是月亮，而是夏季手中那盏昏暗的灯笼，它一路向北，去追赶那畏缩不前的春天。"
"In the nearest corral a flock of sheep lay silent until a groundless panic would send a squad of them huddling together with a drumming rush.","在离我们最近的畜栏里，一群绵羊正静静地躺着休息。突然，一阵莫名其妙的恐慌使其中一小队绵羊在如鼓点般的匆忙中乱挤成一团。"
"For other sounds a shrill family of coyotes yapped beyond the shearing-pen, and whippoorwills twittered in the long grass.","还有其他声音：一群叫声刺耳的小狼在剪毛围栏外狂吠，而北美夜鹰则在长草丛中啁啾。"
"But even these dissonances hardly rippled the clear torrent of the mocking-birds’ notes that fell from a dozen neighbouring shrubs and trees.","可是，即便是这些不和谐的杂音，也难以搅乱从附近灌木丛和树林里传来的，知更鸟那如清澈激流般的鸣唱。"
"It would not have been preposterous for one to tiptoe and essay to touch the stars, they hung so bright and imminent.","要是有谁踮起脚尖，试着去触碰天上的星星，也并非什么荒唐可笑之事，因为星星是如此明亮，又离得那样近。"
"Mr. Kinney’s wife, a young and capable woman, we had left in the house.","金尼先生的妻子是一个年轻而能干的女人，她留在了屋里。"
"She remained to busy herself with the domestic round of duties, in which I had observed that she seemed to take a buoyant and contented pride.","她一直在为家务琐事忙碌着，而且据我观察，她似乎忙得不亦乐乎，还颇为满足和自豪。"
"In one room we had supped.","我们在一个房间里吃了晚饭。"
"Presently, from the other, as Kinney and I sat without, there burst a volume of sudden and brilliant music.","不久，当我和金尼已经坐在外面时，突然从另一个房间传来一阵美妙的乐曲声。"
"If I could justly estimate the art of piano-playing, the construer of that rollicking fantasia had creditably mastered the secrets of the keyboard.","要是我能正确地评价钢琴演奏技艺的话，那么在我看来，那首欢快的幻想曲的演奏者已经充分掌握了琴键的秘诀。"
"A piano, and one so well played, seemed to me to be an unusual thing to find in that small and unpromising ranch-house.","在这间狭小而没什么前途的牧屋里居然有一架钢琴，而且还有人能把它弹得这么出色，这对于我来说真可谓是一件不同寻常之事。"
"I must have looked my surprise at Rush Kinney, for he laughed in his soft, Southern way, and nodded at me through the moonlit haze of our cigarettes.","我肯定一脸惊讶地看着拉什·金尼，因为他以他那南方人的温柔方式笑着，并透过月光映照着的香烟薄雾朝我点点头。"
"“You don’t often hear as agreeable a noise as that on a sheep-ranch,” he remarked; “but I never see any reason for not playing up to the arts and graces just because we happen to live out in the brush.","“你恐怕不会经常在一个牧羊场听到如此令人愉快的声音吧，”他说道，“但仅仅因为我们恰巧住在这偏僻地方，就不去搞点儿艺术和高雅的东西，这可不大合理。"
"It’s a lonesome life for a woman; and if a little music can make it any better, why not have it?","对于一个女人来说，这是一种孤单寂寞的生活，如果一点儿音乐可以让这种生活好过一些的话，为什么不这么做呢？"
"That’s the way I look at it.”","我就是这么想的。”"
"“A wise and generous theory,” I assented.","“真是个智慧而又大度的理论。”我赞同道，"
"“And Mrs. Kinney plays well.","“金尼夫人弹得很好。"
"I am not learned in the science of music, but I should call her an uncommonly good performer.","我并不精于音律，但我觉得她称得上是一位不同寻常的出色的演奏家。"
"She has technic and more than ordinary power.”","她有演奏技巧和过人的能力。”"
"The moon was very bright, you will understand, and I saw upon Kinney’s face a sort of amused and pregnant expression, as though there were things behind it that might be expounded.","你们可以想见，月光分外皎洁，而我在金尼脸上看到一种愉快而又意味深长的表情，似乎在这背后隐藏着可以被详细述说一番的故事。"
"“You came up the trail from the Double-Elm Fork,” he said promisingly.","“你是从双榆树岔口沿路走过来的，”他充满希望地说道，"
"“As you crossed it you must have seen an old deserted jacal to your left under a comma mott.”","“当你经过时，一定看到在你左手边的一片丛林下，有一幢破旧的、荒废着的小茅屋。”"
"“I did,” said I.","“我看到了，”我说，"
"“There was a drove of javalis rooting around it.","“屋子周围还有一群野猪在用鼻子拱土。"
"I could see by the broken corrals that no one lived there.”","我看那畜栏都坏了，家里应该没人住。”"
"“That’s where this music proposition started,” said Kinney.","“那里就是这个音乐故事开始的地方。”金尼说，"
"“I don’t mind telling you about it while we smoke.","“我不介意在我们抽烟的时候给你讲讲这故事。"
"That’s where old Cal Adams lived.","老卡尔·亚当斯曾住在那里。"
"He had about eight hundred graded merinos and a daughter that was solid silk and as handsome as a new stake-rope on a thirty-dollar pony.","他拥有大约八百头分等级的美利诺绵羊和一个出色的女儿，她漂亮得就像安在一匹价值三十美元的小矮马身上的新缰绳一样。"
"And I don’t mind telling you that I was guilty in the second degree of hanging around old Cal’s ranch all the time I could spare away from lambing and shearing.","我也不介意告诉你，在照料小羊羔和剪羊毛之外的所有时间里，我都在老卡尔家的牧场闲逛，对此，我只有一点儿内疚。"
"Miss Marilla was her name; and I had figured it out by the rule of two that she was destined to become the chatelaine and lady superior of Rancho Lomito, belonging to R. Kinney, Esq., where you are now a welcome and honoured guest.","她叫玛丽拉小姐，而且我早已根据成双成对的规则推算出来，她命里注定要成为R.金尼的洛米托牧场——也就是现在先生您成为一位受欢迎的贵客的地方的女主人和第一夫人。"
"“I will say that old Cal wasn’t distinguished as a sheepman.","“我得说，作为一个牧羊人，老卡尔并不出众。"
"He was a little, old stoop-shouldered hombre about as big as a gun scabbard, with scraggy white whiskers, and condemned to the continuous use of language.","他是一位身材矮小、佝偻着肩膀的家伙，大约和枪套一样大，长着几缕参差不齐的白胡须，絮絮叨叨。"
"Old Cal was so obscure in his chosen profession that he wasn’t even hated by the cowmen.","老卡尔在他所选择的行业中实在很不起眼，甚至连牧牛人也不憎恨他。"
"And when a sheepman don’t get eminent enough to acquire the hostility of the cattlemen, he is mighty apt to die unwept and considerably unsung.","当一个牧羊人还不足以杰出到招来牧牛人的敌意时，等到他死的时候就极有可能连哭的人都没有，显然也不会对他大加赞颂。"
"“But that Marilla girl was a benefit to the eye.","“但是那个叫玛丽拉的姑娘却美得惊人。"
"And she was the most elegant kind of a housekeeper.","同时，她也是家庭主妇中最为优雅的那种类型。"
"I was the nearest neighbour, and I used to ride over to the Double-Elm anywhere from nine to sixteen times a week with fresh butter or a quarter of venison or a sample of new sheep-dip just as a frivolous excuse to see Marilla.","我住得离他们最近，曾经在一周内骑马去双榆树岔口九到十六次，去时带上些新鲜的黄油，或是一块鹿肉，或是新的浴羊药液样品，只是以此作为一种无足轻重的理由，去见见玛丽拉。"
"Marilla and me got to be extensively inveigled with each other, and I was pretty sure I was going to get my rope around her neck and lead her over to the Lomito.","玛丽拉和我深深地相互吸引，而且我十分确定我就要用绳子套住她的脖颈，引领她到洛米托牧场去了。"
"Only she was so everlastingly permeated with filial sentiments toward old Cal that I never could get her to talk about serious matters.","只是对老卡尔的孝心一直充满了她的脑子，以至于我从未能与她谈论一些严肃的问题。"
"“You never saw anybody in your life that was as full of knowledge and had less sense than old Cal.","“你恐怕这辈子也碰不到一个像老卡尔那样的人，学识渊博，却缺乏常识。"
"He was advised about all the branches of information contained in learning, and he was up to all the rudiments of doctrines and enlightenment.","他对学问的所有分支都很熟悉，还通晓各种学说和思想的基本理论。"
"You couldn’t advance him any ideas on any of the parts of speech or lines of thought.","关于演说和思路的任何方面的任何想法你都超不过他。"
"You would have thought he was a professor of the weather and politics and chemistry and natural history and the origin of derivations.","你可能会认为他是一位气象学、政治学、化学、自然历史学和词源学方面的教授。"
"Any subject you brought up old Cal could give you an abundant synopsis of it from the Greek root up to the time it was sacked and on the market.","对于你提出的任何话题，老卡尔都能从它的希腊根源开始讲，一直讲到它被包裹起来在市场上出售，给你讲个透。"
"“One day just after the fall shearing I rides over to the Double-Elm with a lady’s magazine about fashions for Marilla and a scientific paper for old Cal.","“一天，刚过了秋季剪羊毛的时节，我就骑马来到双榆树岔口，带了一本女性时尚杂志给玛丽拉，还有一份科学报纸是给老卡尔的。"
"“While I was tying my pony to a mesquite, out runs Marilla, ‘tickled to death’ with some news that couldn’t wait.","“当我正在一棵豆科灌木旁拴马时，玛丽拉跑出来，高兴得要死，迫不及待地要告诉我些消息。"
"“‘Oh, Rush,’ she says, all flushed up with esteem and gratification, ‘what do you think!","“‘哦，拉什，’她高兴得满脸通红，满怀敬意地说道，‘你猜怎么着！"
"Dad’s going to buy me a piano.","爸爸要给我买一架钢琴。"
"Ain’t it grand?","这是不是很棒？"
"I never dreamed I’d ever have one.’","我从没想过自己会有一架钢琴。’"
"“‘It’s sure joyful,’ says I.","“‘这的确令人高兴。’我说，"
"‘I always admired the agreeable uproar of a piano.","‘我一直都很欣赏钢琴那悦耳的韵律。"
"It’ll be lots of company for you.","琴声将时常伴随你左右。"
"That’s mighty good of Uncle Cal to do that.’","卡尔大叔这样做实在是太好了。’"
"“‘I’m all undecided,’ says Marilla, ‘between a piano and an organ.","“‘我还在犹豫不决，’玛丽拉说，‘是要一架钢琴呢，还是要一架风琴。"
"A parlour organ is nice.’","其实一架室内风琴也挺好。’"
"“‘Either of ’em,’ says I, ‘is first-class for mitigating the lack of noise around a sheep-ranch.","“‘无论它们中的哪一种，’我说，‘对于缓解牧羊场周围声音匮乏的情况都是极好的。"
"For my part,’ I says, ‘I shouldn’t like anything better than to ride home of an evening and listen to a few waltzes and jigs, with somebody about your size sitting on the piano-stool and rounding up the notes.’","就我而言，’我接着说道，‘再没有比晚上骑马回到家，听到像你这样的一个人，坐在钢琴凳上将音符聚拢起来，弹奏出一曲曲华尔兹和一支支吉格舞曲更美的事了。’"
"“‘Oh, hush about that,’ says Marilla, ‘and go on in the house.","“‘哦，快别说那个了，’玛丽拉说，‘进屋吧。"
"Dad hasn’t rode out to-day.","爸爸今天没骑马出门。"
"He’s not feeling well.’","他有些不舒服。’"
"“Old Cal was inside, lying on a cot.","“老卡尔在屋里，正躺在一张简易小床上。"
"He had a pretty bad cold and cough.","他患了重感冒，咳嗽得厉害。"
"I stayed to supper.","我留在那里吃了晚饭。"
"“‘Going to get Marilla a piano, I hear,’ says I to him.","“‘听说您要给玛丽拉买架钢琴。’我对他说。"
"“‘Why, yes, something of the kind, Rush,’ says he.","“‘哦，是的，是要买那类的东西，拉什。’他说，"
"‘She’s been hankering for music for a long spell; and I allow to fix her up with something in that line right away.","‘她对音乐渴望已久了，我准备马上为她购置一件那个行当的东西。"
"The sheep sheared six pounds all round this fall; and I’m going to get Marilla an instrument if it takes the price of the whole clip to do it.’","今年秋天，平均从每只羊身上都剪了六磅羊毛，我要为玛丽拉买样乐器，即使那要花掉所有卖羊毛挣来的钱。’"
"“‘Star wayno,’ says I.","“‘好极了，’我说，"
"‘The little girl deserves it.’","‘这小姑娘值得拥有一件。’"
"“‘I’m going to San Antone on the last load of wool,’ says Uncle Cal, ‘and select an instrument for her myself.’","“‘我打算把最后一批羊毛运到圣安东尼去，’卡尔大叔说，‘并亲自为她挑选一件乐器。’"
"“‘Wouldn’t it be better,’ I suggests, ‘to take Marilla along and let her pick out one that she likes?’","“‘带上玛丽拉，’我建议道，‘让她挑一件自己喜欢的会不会更好呢？’"
"“I might have known that would set Uncle Cal going.","“我本该知道，这种建议将会使卡尔大叔喋喋不休。"
"Of course, a man like him, that knew everything about everything, would look at that as a reflection on his attainments.","当然了，像他那样的人，对一切都无所不知无所不晓，肯定会把那句话看作是对他渊博学识的一种挑衅。"
"“‘No, sir, it wouldn’t,’ says he, pulling at his white whiskers.","“‘不，先生，那可不一定。’他捋着白胡子说道，"
"‘There ain’t a better judge of musical instruments in the whole world than what I am.","‘这世界上再没有人比我更会甄别乐器了。"
"I had an uncle,’ says he, ‘that was a partner in a piano-factory, and I’ve seen thousands of ’em put together.","我有个叔叔，’他说，‘他是一家钢琴厂的股东，我见过上千架钢琴的装配过程。"
"I know all about musical instruments from a pipe-organ to a corn-stalk fiddle.","我了解所有乐器，从管风琴到玉米秆小提琴。"
"There ain’t a man lives, sir, that can tell me any news about any instrument that has to be pounded, blowed, scraped, grinded, picked, or wound with a key.’","没有一个在世的人，先生，能告知我有关乐器的任何新鲜事，不论这乐器是需要敲的、吹的、刮的、磨的、弹的，抑或是要上发条的。’"
"“‘You get me what you like, dad,’ says Marilla, who couldn’t keep her feet on the floor from joy.","“‘您就给我买您喜欢的吧，爸爸。’玛丽拉欣喜得蹦蹦跳跳，一边说道，"
"‘Of course you know what to select.","‘您当然知道选什么。"
"I’d just as lief it was a piano or a organ or what.’","不管是一架钢琴，还是一架风琴，或是其他的什么，我都一样高兴。’"
"“‘I see in St. Louis once what they call a orchestrion,’ says Uncle Cal, ‘that I judged was about the finest thing in the way of music ever invented.","“‘我曾在圣路易斯见过一种乐器，他们管它叫奥开斯特里翁琴，’卡尔大叔说，‘我认为那是人类发明的最好的乐器了。"
"But there ain’t room in this house for one.","不过这房子放不下那架琴。"
"Anyway, I imagine they’d cost a thousand dollars.","再说了，我猜那得花个上千美元。"
"I reckon something in the piano line would suit Marilla the best.","我觉得还是钢琴之类的乐器最适合玛丽拉。"
"She took lessons in that respect for two years over at Birdstail.","她曾在雀尾城上过两年那方面的课。"
"I wouldn’t trust the buying of an instrument to anybody else but myself.","除了我自己，让其他任何人去买乐器我都不会放心。"
"I reckon if I hadn’t took up sheep-raising I’d have been one of the finest composers or piano-and-organ manufacturers in the world.’","我觉得，要是当初我没有从事饲养绵羊这一行业，我一定会成为这世上最出色的作曲家或钢琴风琴制造商之一。’"
"“That was Uncle Cal’s style.","“那就是卡尔大叔的风格。"
"But I never lost any patience with him, on account of his thinking so much of Marilla.","但我从来没对他失去耐性，因为他对玛丽拉非常关心。"
"And she thought just as much of him.","而玛丽拉也一样非常关心他。"
"He sent her to the academy over at Birdstail for two years when it took nearly every pound of wool to pay the expenses.","他送玛丽拉到雀尾城的专科院校上了两年学，而那两年的开支几乎花掉了每一磅羊毛所得。"
"“Along about Tuesday Uncle Cal put out for San Antone on the last wagonload of wool.","“大约到了星期二，卡尔大叔运送着最后一货车的羊毛去了圣安东尼。"
"Marilla’s uncle Ben, who lived in Birdstail, come over and stayed at the ranch while Uncle Cal was gone.","在卡尔大叔离开的这段时间里，玛丽拉住在雀尾城的叔叔本来到了牧场，并住了下来。"
"“It was ninety miles to San Antone, and forty to the nearest railroad-station, so Uncle Cal was gone about four days.","“牧羊场距离圣安东尼有九十英里远，距离最近的火车站也有四十英里，因此卡尔大叔走了大约四天。"
"I was over at the Double-Elm when he came rolling back one evening about sundown.","一天傍晚日落时分，他摇摇晃晃地回来了，当时我碰巧也在双榆树岔口。"
"And up there in the wagon, sure enough, was a piano or a organ—we couldn’t tell which—all wrapped up in woolsacks, with a wagon-sheet tied over it in case of rain.","那马车上确实有一架钢琴或风琴——我们区分不出来到底是哪种——全用羊毛袋包裹了起来，上面还绑着一块货车篷布，以防淋雨。"
"And out skips Marilla, hollering, ‘Oh, oh!’ with her eyes shining and her hair a-flying.","玛丽拉跳了出来，欢呼着：‘哦，哦！’她的眼睛闪闪发亮，秀发飞舞。"
"‘Dad—dad,’ she sings out, ‘have you brought it—have you brought it?’—and it right there before her eyes, as women will do.","‘爸爸——爸爸，’她简直唱了出来，‘你买了吗——你买了吗？’——琴明明就在她眼前嘛，女人都会这样。"
"“‘Finest piano in San Antone,’ says Uncle Cal, waving his hand, proud.","“‘圣安东尼最好的钢琴，’卡尔大叔挥着手，自豪地说道，"
"‘Genuine rosewood, and the finest, loudest tone you ever listened to.","‘真正的紫檀木，音色也是你听过的最美妙、最响亮的。"
"I heard the storekeeper play it, and I took it on the spot and paid cash down.’","我听琴行老板弹过这琴，当场就付现金买下了它。’"
"“Me and Ben and Uncle Cal and a Mexican lifted it out of the wagon and carried it in the house and set it in a corner.","“我和本、卡尔大叔，还有一个墨西哥人一起把钢琴从马车上搬下来，抬进屋里，放置在一个角落里。"
"It was one of them upright instruments, and not very heavy or very big.","它是一种直立式的乐器，既不太沉，也不太大。"
"“And then all of a sudden Uncle Cal flops over and says he’s mighty sick.","“可是那之后，卡尔大叔突然猛地坐了下来，说他觉得非常难受。"
"He’s got a high fever, and he complains of his lungs.","他发了高烧，还直抱怨肺部不好受。"
"He gets into bed, while me and Ben goes out to unhitch and put the horses in the pasture, and Marilla flies around to get Uncle Cal something hot to drink.","他躺到床上，我和本出去解开马缰，把马牵到牧场上，玛丽拉则飞快地跑来跑去，给卡尔大叔弄点儿热东西喝。"
"But first she puts both arms on that piano and hugs it with a soft kind of a smile, like you see kids doing with their Christmas toys.","但她还是先张开双臂拥抱了钢琴，面带温柔的微笑，就像你看到的孩子们对待他们的圣诞玩具那样。"
"“When I came in from the pasture, Marilla was in the room where the piano was.","“当我从牧场回来时，玛丽拉正在放有钢琴的房间里呆着。"
"I could see by the strings and woolsacks on the floor that she had had it unwrapped.","通过地上散落着的绳子和羊毛袋，我看得出她已经把它拆封了。"
"But now she was tying the wagon-sheet over it again, and there was a kind of solemn, whitish look on her face.","可现在，她正重新把那块篷布绑到琴上，面色有些苍白，表情有些严肃。"
"“‘Ain’t wrapping up the music again, are you, Marilla?’ I asks.","“‘你不会再把琴包起来了，是吧，玛丽拉？’我问道，"
"‘What’s the matter with just a couple of tunes for to see how she goes under the saddle?’","‘弹一两下，看看它在卸下马鞍后怎么样，如何？’"
"“‘Not to-night, Rush,’ says she.","“‘今晚不行，拉什，’她说，"
"‘I don’t want to play any to-night.","‘我今晚一点儿也不想弹。"
"Dad’s too sick.","爸爸病得太厉害。"
"Just think, Rush, he paid three hundred dollars for it—nearly a third of what the wool-clip brought!’","你想想，拉什，他买这琴花了三百块钱——几乎是这一季卖羊毛总收入的三分之一啊！’"
"“‘Well, it ain’t anyways in the neighbourhood of a third of what you are worth,’ I told her.","“‘可无论如何，它也远不及你的价值的三分之一呀。’我告诉她说，"
"‘And I don’t think Uncle Cal is too sick to hear a little agitation of the piano-keys just to christen the machine.","‘我想卡尔大叔还不至于病得听不见，你就稍稍拨弄几下琴键，仅仅给这机器来个洗礼仪式而已。"
"“‘Not to-night, Rush,’ says Marilla, in a way that she had when she wanted to settle things.","“‘今晚不行，拉什。’玛丽拉以她要决定某事时惯用的口吻说。"
"“But it seems that Uncle Cal was plenty sick, after all.","“总之，卡尔大叔似乎病得相当严重。"
"He got so bad that Ben saddled up and rode over to Birdstail for Doc Simpson.","他病得太厉害了，所以本备好马，一路飞奔到雀尾城去请辛普森医生。"
"I stayed around to see if I’d be needed for anything.","我留了下来，看看有没有什么事需要我帮忙。"
"“When Uncle Cal’s pain let up on him a little he called Marilla and says to her: ‘Did you look at your instrument, honey?","“当卡尔大叔的疼痛稍稍缓解一点儿的时候，他叫来玛丽拉，对她说：‘你看过你的钢琴了吗，亲爱的？"
"And do you like it?’","你喜欢吗？’"
"“‘It’s lovely, dad,’ says she, leaning down by his pillow; ‘I never saw one so pretty.","“‘它非常可爱，爸爸，’她斜靠着卡尔大叔的枕头说，‘我从没见过这么漂亮的钢琴。"
"How dear and good it was of you to buy it for me!’","您为我买下了它，您实在是太好了！’"
"“‘I haven’t heard you play on it any yet,’ says Uncle Cal; ‘and I’ve been listening.","“‘我还没听你弹过它呢，’卡尔大叔说，‘我一直在注意听。"
"My side don’t hurt quite so bad now—won’t you play a piece, Marilla?’","现在我不那么痛了——你不愿意弹一曲吗，玛丽拉？’"
"“But no; she puts Uncle Cal off and soothes him down like you’ve seen women do with a kid.","“可是她没有弹，她搪塞了卡尔大叔两句，并抚慰他平静下来，就像女人哄孩子时做的那样。"
"It seems she’s made up her mind not to touch that piano at present.","她似乎已下定决心，现在不去碰那架钢琴。"
"“When Doc Simpson comes over he tells us that Uncle Cal has pneumonia the worst kind; and as the old man was past sixty and nearly on the lift anyhow, the odds was against his walking on grass any more.","“辛普森医生赶来了，他告诉我们，卡尔大叔患上了最严重的肺炎，况且老人已经六十多岁了，身体也有些虚弱，恐怕再也不可能在草地上漫步了。"
"“On the fourth day of his sickness he calls for Marilla again and wants to talk piano.","“在他病倒的第四天，他又叫来玛丽拉，想和她谈谈钢琴的事。"
"Doc Simpson was there, and so was Ben and Mrs. Ben, trying to do all they could.","辛普森医生在那里，本和他夫人也都在，尽力去做一切他们能做的事。"
"“‘I’d have made a wonderful success in anything connected with music,’ says Uncle Cal.","“‘我在音乐方面取得了一个了不起的成就。’卡尔大叔说，"
"‘I got the finest instrument for the money in San Antone.","‘我在圣安东尼买到了最好、最物有所值的乐器。"
"Ain’t that piano all right in every respect, Marilla?’","那架钢琴是不是很完美，玛丽拉？’"
"“‘It’s just perfect, dad,’ says she.","“‘太完美啦，爸爸。’她说，"
"‘It’s got the finest tone I ever heard.","‘它演奏出了我听到过的最动听的音调。"
"But don’t you think you could sleep a little while now, dad?’","但是，您现在能不能稍微睡一会儿呢，爸爸？’"
"“‘No, I don’t,’ says Uncle Cal.","“‘不，我不想睡，’卡尔大叔说，"
"‘I want to hear that piano.","‘我想听听那架钢琴的琴声。"
"I don’t believe you’ve even tried it yet.","我不信你已经试弹过了。"
"I went all the way to San Antone and picked it out for you myself.","我一路跑到圣安东尼，亲自为你挑选了这架钢琴。"
"It took a third of the fall clip to buy it; but I don’t mind that if it makes my good girl happier.","为了买它，我花了这一季剪羊毛所得的三分之一，但只要它能让我的好女儿更快乐，我才不介意。"
"Won’t you play a little bit for dad, Marilla?’","你不愿为爸爸弹两首吗，玛丽拉？’"
"“Doc Simpson beckoned Marilla to one side and recommended her to do what Uncle Cal wanted, so it would get him quieted.","“辛普森医生示意玛丽拉来到一边，劝她按照卡尔大叔所希望的去做，那会使他平静下来。"
"And her uncle Ben and his wife asked her, too.","她的叔叔和婶婶也一起劝她。"
"“‘Why not hit out a tune or two with the soft pedal on?’ I asks Marilla.","“‘为什么不踩着弱音踏板弹上一两曲呢？’我问玛丽拉，"
"‘Uncle Cal has begged you so often.","‘卡尔大叔一再地央求你。"
"It would please him a good deal to hear you touch up the piano he’s bought for you.","听到你弹他为你买的钢琴，他一定会非常高兴的。"
"Don’t you think you might?’","你不可以弹一下吗？’"
"“But Marilla stands there with big tears rolling down from her eyes and says nothing.","“但是玛丽拉只是站在那儿，硕大的泪珠从眼睛里滚下来，却一句话也不说。"
"And then she runs over and slips her arm under Uncle Cal’s neck and hugs him tight.","然后，她跑过去，把胳膊伸到卡尔大叔的脖颈下，紧紧地拥抱着他。"
"“‘Why, last night, dad,’ we heard her say, ‘I played it ever so much.","“‘哎呀，昨天晚上，爸爸，’我们听到她说，‘我弹了好多呢。"
"Honest—I have been playing it.","真的——我一直在弹。"
"And it’s such a splendid instrument, you don’t know how I love it.","这真是一件出色的乐器，你不知道我有多喜爱它。"
"Last night I played “Bonnie Dundee” and the “Anvil Polka” and the “Blue Danube”—and lots of pieces.","昨天晚上我弹了《漂亮的邓迪》、《乐砧波尔卡》和《蓝色多瑙河》——还有许多曲目。"
"You must surely have heard me playing a little, didn’t you, dad?","你肯定听到了一点儿我弹的声音，对吗，爸爸？"
"I didn’t like to play loud when you was so sick.’","我不想在你病得这么严重的时候弹得太响亮。’"
"“‘Well, well,’ says Uncle Cal, ‘maybe I did.","“‘好吧，好吧，’卡尔大叔说，‘可能我听到了。"
"Maybe I did and forgot about it.","可能我听到了又忘了。"
"My head is a little cranky at times.","有时，我脑子有点儿混乱。"
"I heard the man in the store play it fine.","我听到琴行里的那个人弹得很好。"
"I’m mighty glad you like it, Marilla.","真高兴你喜欢这架琴，玛丽拉。"
"Yes, I believe I could go to sleep a while if you’ll stay right beside me till I do.’","是的，如果你能一直陪在我身边直到我睡着，我相信我能睡一会儿。’"
"“There was where Marilla had me guessing.","“这就是玛丽拉让我捉摸不透的地方。"
"Much as she thought of that old man, she wouldn’t strike a note on that piano that he’d bought her.","她处处为那老人着想，却不愿在他为她买来的钢琴上弹出一个音符。"
"I couldn’t imagine why she told him she’d been playing it, for the wagon-sheet hadn’t ever been off of it since she put it back on the same day it come.","我想不明白她为什么要告诉卡尔大叔她已经弹过了，因为钢琴拉回来的那天，她又把篷布盖回到钢琴上，之后就一直没扯下来。"
"I knew she could play a little anyhow, for I’d once heard her snatch some pretty fair dance-music out of an old piano at the Charco Largo Ranch.","我知道她无论如何是会弹一点儿的，因为我曾在查科拉戈牧场听到过她在一架旧钢琴上弹了几首不错的舞曲。"
"“Well, in about a week the pneumonia got the best of Uncle Cal.","“唉，过了大约一个星期，肺炎还是击垮了卡尔大叔。"
"They had the funeral over at Birdstail, and all of us went over.","他们在雀尾城举行了葬礼，我们都过去了。"
"I brought Marilla back home in my buckboard.","我驾着马车把玛丽拉送回家。"
"Her uncle Ben and his wife were going to stay there a few days with her.","她的叔叔本和婶婶将陪她在那里住几天。"
"“That night Marilla takes me in the room where the piano was, while the others were out on the gallery.","“那天晚上，玛丽拉带我来到放有钢琴的那个房间，当时其他人都在屋外的走廊上。"
"“‘Come here, Rush,’ says she; ‘I want you to see this now.’","“‘到这儿来，拉什，’她说，‘现在我想让你看看这架琴。’"
"“She unties the rope, and drags off the wagon-sheet.","“她解开绳子，扯下那块马车篷布。"
"“If you ever rode a saddle without a horse, or fired off a gun that wasn’t loaded, or took a drink out of an empty bottle, why, then you might have been able to scare an opera or two out of the instrument Uncle Cal had bought.","“如果你曾骑过没放在马背上的马鞍，或者开过没装子弹的枪，或者对着个空瓶子喝过酒，那么，或许你能惊人地在卡尔大叔买的乐器上弹出一两段歌剧。"
"“Instead of a piano, it was one of the machines they’ve invented to play the piano with.","“那不是一架钢琴，而是他们发明出来的弹钢琴时要用的机器之一。"
"By itself it was about as musical as the holes of a flute without the flute.","作为一个乐器来说，它的功能与那没长在长笛上的笛孔是一样的。"
"“And that was the piano that Uncle Cal had selected; and standing by it was the good, fine, all-wool girl that never let him know it.","“那就是卡尔大叔挑选出来的钢琴，而站在它旁边的是那个好心、善良、纯真的姑娘，她终究也没让他知道这件事。"
"“And what you heard playing a while ago,” concluded Mr. Kinney, “was that same deputy-piano machine; only just at present it’s shoved up against a six-hundred-dollar piano that I bought for Marilla as soon as we was married.”","“你刚才听到的弹奏的，”金尼先生最后说道，“就是那架钢琴代理机器，只不过现在它已经安装在了一架价值六百美元的、我们结婚后我马上为玛丽拉买的钢琴上。”"
