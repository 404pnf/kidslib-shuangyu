"Which Was the Foolishest","谁的丈夫更蠢"
"by Andrew Lang","作者：安德鲁·朗格"
"In a little village that stood on a wide plain, where you could see the sun from the moment he rose to the moment he set, there lived two couples side by side.","在一片辽阔的平原上有一个小村庄，村子里并排住着两对夫妻。在平原上，你能看着太阳从升起到落下。"
"The men, who worked under the same master, were quite good friends, but the wives were always quarrelling, and the subject they quarrelled most about was—which of the two had the stupidest husband.","丈夫们为同一位雇主干活，是很好的朋友，但是妻子们却终日争吵，她们争论的话题往往是——谁的丈夫更蠢。"
"Unlike most women—who think that anything that belongs to them must be better than what belongs to anyone else—each thought her husband the more foolish of the two.","她们不像大多数女人那样——那些女人认为自己的东西一定要比别人的好——她们都认为自己的丈夫比对方的更蠢。"
"‘You should just see what he does!’ one said to her neighbour.","“你应该看看他做了些什么！”其中一个对她的邻居说，"
"‘He puts on the baby’s frock upside down, and, one day, I found him trying to feed her with boiling soup, and her mouth was scalded for days after.","“他总是会把女儿的连衣裙穿反了，而且，有一天，我看到他正试着给她喂滚烫的汤，弄得她的嘴被烫起了泡，好多天才好。"
"Then he picks up stones in the road and sows them instead of potatoes, and one day he wanted to go into the garden from the top window, because he declared it was a shorter way than through the door.’","还有，他把在路上捡的石头当作土豆播种下去；还有一天，他想从阁楼的窗户到花园里去，就因为他认为从这里走比从门走更近。”"
"‘That is bad enough, of course,’ answered the other; ‘but it is really NOTHING to what I have to endure every day from MY husband.","“当然，这真够笨的，”另一个回答说，“不过，这个和我每天要忍受的我丈夫的所作所为比起来就算不了什么了。"
"If, when I am busy, I ask him to go and feed the poultry, he is certain to give them some poisonous stuff instead of their proper food, and when I visit the yard next I find them all dead.","如果当我在忙的时候，我让他去喂鸡，他不喂鸡食反而喂些有毒的东西，当我到院子里的时候，发现它们全死了。"
"Once he even took my best bonnet, when I had gone away to my sick mother, and when I came back I found he had given it to the hen to lay her eggs in.","一次，我去看望我生病了的母亲，而他拿走了我最好的软帽，当我回来后才发现，他竟然让母鸡在里面下蛋。"
"And you know yourself that, only last week, when I sent him to buy a cask of butter, he returned driving a hundred and fifty ducks which someone had induced him to take, and not one of them would lay.’","你也知道的，就在上个星期，我让他去买一桶黄油，他却赶着一百五十只鸭子回来了，那是有人骗他买的，而且那么多鸭子里没有一只会下蛋。”"
"‘Yes, I am afraid he IS trying,’ replied the first; ‘but let us put them to the proof, and see which of them is the most foolish.’","“是的，我想他确实正在努力让它们下蛋吧，”第一个女人回答，“不过让我们证明看看，他们俩谁更蠢。”"
"So, about the time that she expected her husband home from work, she got out her spinning-wheel, and sat busily turning it, taking care not even to look up from her work when the man came in.","于是，第一个女人估摸着她丈夫差不多要回来了，就拿出她的纺纱车，坐在那里忙碌地摇着纺纱车，当她丈夫进来时，她故意头也不抬。"
"For some minutes he stood with his mouth open watching her, and as she still remained silent, he said at last:","他张着嘴盯着她，就那么站了好一会儿，可她还是保持沉默。最后他说："
"‘Have you gone mad, wife, that you sit spinning without anything on the wheel?’","“老婆，你疯了吧，轮子上什么也没有，你坐在那儿纺什么？”"
"‘YOU may think that there is nothing on it,’ answered she, ‘but I can assure you that there is a large skein of wool, so fine that nobody can see it, which will be woven into a coat for you.’","“可能你认为上面什么都没有，”她回答说，“但是我可以肯定的是，这里有一大卷羊毛，只是太细了，所以没有人看得见。我要用这些羊毛给你织一件外套。”"
"‘Dear me!’ he replied, ‘what a clever wife I have got!","“天啊！”他答道，“我有一个多么聪明的妻子呀！"
"If you had not told me I should never have known that there was any wool on the wheel at all.","要不是你告诉我，我绝对不会知道轮子上有羊毛。"
"But now I really do seem to see something.’","但是现在我好像真的能看到些了。”"
"The woman smiled and was silent, and after spinning busily for an hour more, she got up from her stoop, and began to weave as fast as she could.","女人笑了笑，没有说话，忙着又摇了一个小时的轮子，然后她直起身来，开始拼命地编织。"
"At last she got up, and said to her husband: ‘I am too tired to finish it to-night, so I shall go to bed, and to-morrow I shall only have the cutting and stitching to do.’","最后，她站起来，对她丈夫说：“我太累了，今晚做不完，我得上床休息了，明天就只要做些裁剪和缝制就好了。”"
"So the next morning she got up early, and after she had cleaned her house, and fed her chickens, and put everything in its place again, she bent over the kitchen table, and the sound of her big scissors might be heard snip! snap! as far as the garden.","因此第二天早上，她很早就起床了，打扫完屋子，喂过了鸡，把所有的东西都归了位之后，她俯身在厨房的桌子上，挥舞着大剪刀开始裁剪，在院子里都可以听到咔嚓咔嚓的声音。"
"Her husband could not see anything to snip at; but then he was so stupid that was not surprising!","她的丈夫看不到任何可以剪的东西，但是他太蠢了，居然一点儿也不惊讶！"
"After the cutting came the sewing.","裁剪完了之后是缝制。"
"The woman patted and pinned and fixed and joined, and then, turning to the man, she said:","妻子拍拍钉钉，缝缝合合，然后转过身对着丈夫说："
"‘Now it is ready for you to try on.’","“现在做好了，你来穿上试试。”"
"And she made him take off his coat, and stand up in front of her, and once more she patted an pinned and fixed and joined, and was very careful in smoothing out every wrinkle.","接着她让他脱下外套，站在她的前面。她又拍拍拽拽，缝缝合合，很仔细地整平每一个褶皱。"
"‘It does not feel very warm,’ observed the man at last, when he had borne all this patiently for a long time.","“感觉不是很暖和。”丈夫忍耐了许久，最后终于开口了。"
"‘That is because it is so fine,’ answered she; ‘you do not want it to be as thick as the rough clothes you wear every day.’","“那是因为它太细了，”她回答，“你不会想让它和你每天穿的粗糙的外套一样厚吧。”"
"He DID, but was ashamed to say so, and only answered: ‘Well, I am sure it must be beautiful since you say so, and I shall be smarter than anyone in the whole village.","他确实是这么想的，但是他羞于承认，只能回答说：“哦，既然你这么说，衣服肯定很美，我要比村子里的其他任何人都潇洒。"
"“What a splendid coat!” they will exclaim when they see me.","当他们看到我时，他们会说：‘多美的外套呀！’"
"But it is not everybody who has a wife as clever as mine.’","但是，不是人人都有一个像我老婆这样聪明的老婆。”"
"Meanwhile the other wife was not idle.","同时，另一个妻子也没闲着。"
"As soon as her husband entered she looked at him with such a look of terror that the poor man was quite frightened.","她的丈夫一进门，她就神情非常阴沉地看着他，让这个可怜的男人感觉十分害怕。"
"‘Why do you stare at me so?","“你干嘛这样盯着我？"
"Is there anything the matter?’ asked he.","有什么问题吗？”他问道。"
"‘Oh! go to bed at once,’ she cried; ‘you must be very ill indeed to look like that!’","“哦，快去床上躺着吧，”她叫道，“你一定是病得太重了，才会看起来像这样！”"
"The man was rather surprised at first, as he felt particularly well that evening; but the moment his wife spoke he became quite certain that he had something dreadful the matter with him, and grew quite pale.","丈夫一开始十分惊讶，因为那天晚上他觉得自己的状态格外好，可是他妻子一说，他也就十分确定自己是得了可怕的病了，开始变得很虚弱。"
"‘I dare say it would be the best place for me,’ he answered, trembling; and he suffered his wife to take him upstairs, and to help him off with his clothes.","“我想，对于我来说，或许那是最好的地方了。”他颤抖着说。他让妻子扶他上楼，并帮他脱下衣服。"
"‘If you sleep well during the mightnight there MAY be a chance for you,’ said she, shaking her head, as she tucked him up warmly; ‘but if not—’","“要是你晚上睡得好，或许你还有一线生机，”她摇着头说，一边盖好被子让他暖和，“但是如果没有——”"
"And of course the poor man never closed an eye till the sun rose.","当然，这个可怜的男人整夜都没合眼。"
"‘How do you feel this morning?’ asked the woman, coming in on tip-toe when her house-work was finished.","“早上感觉怎么样？”妻子做完家务后，踮着脚尖进来问道。"
"‘Oh, bad; very bad indeed,’ answered he; ‘I have not slept for a moment.","“唉，不好，事实上是非常不好，”他回答说，“我一刻也没有睡着。"
"Can you think of something to make me better?’","你能不能想办法让我好起来？”"
"‘I will try everything that is possible,’ said the wife, who did not in the least wish her husband to die, but was determined to show that he was more foolish that the other man.","“我会尝试每个可能的办法,”妻子说，她一点儿也不想让她的丈夫死，只不过是想证明他比另一个女人的丈夫更愚蠢，"
"‘I will get some dried herbs and make you a drink, but I am very much afraid that it is too late.","“我去弄些干草药给你喝吧，但是我只怕太晚了。"
"Why did you not tell me before?’","你为什么不早点儿告诉我呢？”"
"‘I thought perhaps the pain would go off in a day or two; and, besides, I did not want to make you unhappy,’ answered the man, who was by this time quite sure he had been suffering tortures, and had borne them like a hero.","“我以为或许忍一两天，疼痛就过去了。再说，我也不想让你担心，”丈夫答道，此时，他十分肯定他已经是病魔缠身，并且一直像英雄一样忍受着，"
"‘Of course, if I had had any idea how ill I really was, I should have spoken at once.’","“当然，我要是早知道自己病得有多重，我当时就讲出来了。”"
"‘Well, well, I will see what can be done,’ said the wife, ‘but talking is not good for you.","“好了，好了，我会想想有什么能做的，”妻子说，“但是说话对你可没好处。"
"Lie still, and keep yourself warm.’","躺着别动，盖好被子。”"
"All that day the man lay in bed, and whenever his wife entered the room and asked him, with a shake of the head, how he felt, he always replied that he was getting worse.","丈夫在床上躺了一整天，无论何时他的妻子走进房间，摇着头问他感觉怎么样，他总是说，感觉越来越糟了。"
"At last, in the evening, she burst into tears, and when he inquired what was the matter, she sobbed out:","最后，傍晚时分，她突然失声痛哭。丈夫问她怎么回事，她哽咽着说："
"‘Oh, my poor, poor husband, are you really dead?","“唉，我可怜的、可怜的丈夫，你真的不行了吗？"
"I must go to-morrow and order your coffin.’","我明天必须去给你订棺材了。”"
"Now, when the man heard this, a cold shiver ran through his body, and all at once he knew that he was as well as he had ever been in his life.","她丈夫一听，立马打了一个寒战，而且突然间，他发现自己和往常一样健康。"
"‘Oh, no, no!’ he cried, ‘I feel quite recovered!","“哦，不，不！”他叫道，“我感觉完全恢复了！"
"Indeed, I think I shall go out to work.’","真的，我想我应该到外面去干活了。”"
"‘You will do no such thing,’ replied his wife.","“你不能这么做，”他的妻子回答道，"
"‘Just keep quite quiet, for before the sun rises you will be a dead man.’","“在太阳升起来之前别出声，你会咽气的。”"
"The man was very frightened at her words, and lay absolutely still while the undertaker came and measured him for his coffin; and his wife gave orders to the gravedigger about his grave.","她丈夫被她的话吓住了，棺材铺的伙计来量尺寸时，他一动不动地躺着。他的妻子则吩咐掘墓的人为他挖好坟墓。"
"That evening the coffin was sent home, and in the morning at nine o’clock the woman put him on a long flannel garment, and called to the undertaker’s men to fasten down the lid and carry him to the grave, where all their friends were waiting them.","那天晚上，棺材送到了家里。第二天早上九点整，妻子给他穿上法兰绒的长袍寿衣，然后叫棺材铺的伙计们盖紧棺材盖，把他抬到墓地里，他们的朋友都在那里等着他们。"
"Just as the body was being placed in the ground the other woman’s husband came running up, dressed, as far as anyone could see, in no clothes at all.","他们正准备放下棺材，另一个女人的丈夫就跑着过来了，所有人都看到他一丝不挂。"
"Everybody burst into shouts of laughter at the sight of him, and the men laid down the coffin and laughed too, till their sides nearly split.","大家一看到他，都忍不住哈哈大笑。抬棺材的人也都放下棺材，笑得前仰后合。"
"The dead man was so astonished at this behaviour, that he peeped out of a little window in the side of the coffin, and cried out:","那个躺在棺材里的人觉得很惊讶，他从棺材侧面的小窗户里往外看，喊道："
"‘I should laugh as loudly as any of you, if I were not a dead man.’","“要不是我死了，我会笑得和你们一样大声。”"
"When they heard the voice coming from the coffin the other people suddenly stopped laughing, and stood as if they had been turned into stone.","村民们听到有声音从棺材里传出来，立即止住大笑，愣在那里，如同石化。"
"Then they rushed with one accord to the coffin, and lifted the lid so that the man could step out amongst them.","接着他们一齐冲向棺材，掀开盖子。死去的丈夫走了出来，站在他们中间。"
"‘Were you really not dead after all?’ asked they.","“你究竟是不是真的死了？”他们问，"
"‘And if not, why did you let yourself be buried?’","“如果没死，为什么你会让自己被埋了？”"
"At this the wives both confessed that they had each wished to prove that her husband was stupider than the other.","直到这时，两个妻子才承认，她们俩只是想证明自己的丈夫比对方的丈夫更蠢。"
"But the villagers declared that they could not decide which was the most foolish—the man who allowed himself to be persuaded that he was wearing fine clothes when he was dressed in nothing, or the man who let himself be buried when he was alive and well.","然而，村民们都表示，他们没法决定谁更蠢——是那个一丝不挂，却坚信自己穿着精致的衣裳的，还是那个本来好好的，却让自己下葬的。"
"So the women quarrelled just as much as they did before, and no one ever knew whose husband was the most foolish.","就这样，两个女人一如既往地争吵起来，而且没人知道谁的丈夫更蠢。"
