"To Georges Legrand.","致乔治斯·勒格朗"
"Hardly a day goes by without our reading a news item like the following in some newspaper:","几乎每天都会在报纸上看到下面这样的新闻："
"“On Wednesday night the people living in No.40 Rue de—, were awakened by two successive shots.","“星期三晚上，住在某某街四十号的居民被两声连续的枪声惊醒。"
"The explosions seemed to come from the apartment occupied by M. X—. The door was broken in and the man was found bathed in his blood, still holding in one hand the revolver with which he had taken his life.","枪声似乎是从X先生居住的公寓里传出来的。人们破门而入，发现X先生倒在血泊里，一只手依然握着那把结束他自己生命的左轮手枪。"
"“M. X—was fifty-seven years of age, enjoying a comfortable income, and had everything necessary to make him happy.","“X先生57岁，收入丰厚，衣食无忧，可以说凡是幸福生活所需要的，他全都有了。"
"No cause can be found for his action.”","人们找不到理由来解释他的这一自杀行为。”"
"What terrible grief, what unknown suffering, hidden despair, secret wounds drive these presumably happy persons to suicide?","究竟是怎样可怕的不幸和不为人知的苦难，又是什么隐藏的绝望和难以启齿的伤痛使这些被公认为幸福的人们自寻短见？"
"We search, we imagine tragedies of love, we suspect financial troubles, and, as we never find anything definite, we apply to these deaths the word “mystery.”","我们寻找原因，猜想可能是失恋的缘故，抑或是遇到严重的经济麻烦，但种种设想都缺乏证据的支撑，最后我们只能将这类自杀归结为一个“谜”字。"
"A letter found on the desk of one of these “suicides without cause,” and written during his last night, beside his loaded revolver, has come into our hands.","一封在一桩“无缘由自杀者”的桌上被发现的信落入了我们的手里。这封信是他在生前最后一夜写的，就放在那把上膛的手枪旁边。"
"We deem it rather interesting.","我们认为这封信非常耐人寻味。"
"It reveals none of those great catastrophes which we always expect to find behind these acts of despair; but it shows us the slow succession of the little vexations of life, the disintegration of a lonely existence, whose dreams have disappeared; it gives the reason for these tragic ends, which only nervous and high-strung people can understand.","信中没有透露任何我们期望找到的、隐藏在这些绝望举动背后的重大灾祸，而只是记述了生活中一连串琐碎的烦恼、孤寂人生的瓦解和梦想的破灭，这些最终都可导致这一悲剧的发生，这一切只有那些神经质的、思维敏感的人才会懂。"
"Here it is:","信的内容是这样的："
"“It is midnight.","“现在已是午夜时分。"
"When I have finished this letter I shall kill myself.","写完这封信后我将自杀。"
"Why? I shall attempt to give the reasons, not for those who may read these lines, but for myself, to kindle my waning courage, to impress upon myself the fatal necessity of this act which can, at best, be only deferred.","至于为什么？我将尽力解释其中的原因，但不是为了今后读到这封信的人，只是为了我自己，让我自己重拾那逐渐减弱的勇气，让自己铭记这一行为的必要性，充其量只是能将其推迟一下。"
"“I was brought up by simple-minded parents who were unquestioning believers.","“我的父母心地单纯，从来不会对什么发出质疑。"
"And I believed as they did.","我过去的思想也和他们一样。"
"“My dream lasted a long time.","“很长一段时间，我都是满怀梦想的。"
"The last veil has just been torn from my eyes.","那梦想的最后一层薄纱也只是最近才在我眼前被撕裂。"
"“During the last few years a strange change has been taking place within me.","“近几年来，我也发生了一些奇怪的变化。"
"All the events of Life, which formerly had to me the glow of a beautiful sunset, are now fading away.","生命中的一切，过去对我而言如同落日一般绚丽美妙，如今那光芒却都渐渐消失殆尽。"
"The true meaning of things has appeared to me in its brutal reality; and the true reason for love has bred in me disgust even for this poetic sentiment: ‘We are the eternal toys of foolish and charming illusions, which are always being renewed.’","事物的真实含义在我面前呈现出残酷的面貌，爱的真正理由甚至使我对诗意的情愫都很厌恶：‘我们是那些永远在翻新的、既愚蠢又迷人的幻觉的永恒玩偶。’"
"“On growing older, I had become partly reconciled to the awful mystery of life, to the uselessness of effort; when the emptiness of everything appeared to me in a new light, this evening, after dinner.","“随着年龄的增长，我开始慢慢接受生活的可怕神秘，明白努力是徒劳无用的。就在今晚晚餐后，我看到一切空虚都闪耀着全新的光芒。"
"“Formerly, I was happy!","“从前，我也是很快乐的。"
"Everything pleased me: the passing women, the appearance of the streets, the place where I lived; and I even took an interest in the cut of my clothes.","一切都让我感到开心：来来往往的女人、街上的景象、我居住的地方，甚至是我的衣服的款式，都让我产生浓厚的兴趣。"
"But the repetition of the same sights has had the result of filling my heart with weariness and disgust, just as one would feel were one to go every night to the same theatre.","但是同样的东西重复地看来看去，也使我从心里萌生一股疲倦和厌恶感，这就如同一个人每天晚上去同一家剧院一样。"
"“For the last thirty years I have been rising at the same hour; and, at the same restaurant, for thirty years, I have been eating at the same hours the same dishes brought me by different waiters.","“30年来，我每天在同一个时间起床。30年来，我在同一家饭店，在同一时刻，吃不同的侍者端来的相同的菜肴。”"
"“I have tried travel.","“我也尝试去旅游。"
"The loneliness which one feels in strange places terrified me. I felt so alone, so small on the earth that I quickly started on my homeward journey.","但是身处异乡的孤寂感让我害怕。我觉得自己在世界上是那么孤单、那么渺小，于是我就很快又启程回家了。"
"“But here the unchanging expression of my furniture, which has stood for thirty years in the same place, the smell of my apartments (for, with time, each dwelling takes on a particular odor) each night, these and other things disgust me and make me sick of living thus.","“但是回到家，看到家里30年来从未变样甚至连摆放位置都没有变动的家具，每晚闻到家里特有的气味（因为随着时间的推移，每个处所都有其特有的气味），所有的一切都使我嫌恶不已，让我对生活充满了厌倦。"
"“Everything repeats itself endlessly.","“每一件事都无休止地重复着。"
"The way in which I put my key in the lock, the place where I always find my matches, the first object which meets my eye when I enter the room, make me feel like jumping out of the window and putting an end to those monotonous events from which we can never escape.","每次我把钥匙插入锁中的方式，我放火柴的地方，我开门后第一眼看到的东西，这些都使我想从窗口跳下去，结束这种单调乏味而我们又总也难以摆脱的生活。"
"“Each day, when I shave, I feel an inordinate desire to cut my throat; and my face, which I see in the little mirror, always the same, with soap on my cheeks, has several times made me weak from sadness.","“每天，当我刮脸的时候，我都有一股强烈的欲望，那就是割断自己的咽喉；我在小镜子里看见我那张双颊抹着肥皂、永远不变的脸，有好几次忍不住悲从中来。"
"“Now I even hate to be with people whom I used to meet with pleasure; I know them so well, I can tell just what they are going to say and what I am going to answer.","“现在，我甚至讨厌与我过去喜欢的人呆在一起，因为我太了解他们了，我都可以知道他们会说些什么，而我又将会怎么答复他们。"
"Each brain is like a circus, where the same horse keeps circling around eternally.","每个人的脑袋就如同一个马戏团，里面有一匹同样的马，永远不停地在转圈子。"
"We must circle round always, around the same ideas, the same joys, the same pleasures, the same habits, the same beliefs, the same sensations of disgust.","我们总是必须兜圈子，围着同样的思想、同样的快乐、同样的乐趣、同样的习惯、同样的信仰，甚至同样令人讨厌的东西。"
"“The fog was terrible this evening.","“今夜的雾气特别浓厚，令人讨厌极了。"
"It enfolded the boulevard, where the street lights were dimmed and looked like smoking candles.","它笼罩着林阴大道，那里的街灯十分昏暗，看起来就像是冒着烟的蜡烛。"
"A heavier weight than usual oppressed me. Perhaps my digestion was bad.","有一个比平日更加沉重的重量压着我。也许是我的消化不好。"
"“For good digestion is everything in life.","“因为好的消化能力在生活中是非常重要的。"
"It gives the inspiration to the artist, amorous desires to young people, clear ideas to thinkers, the joy of life to everybody, and it also allows one to eat heartily (which is one of the greatest pleasures).","它让艺术家产生灵感，让年轻人萌生爱意，让思想家产生清晰的思路，让所有人感受人生的快乐，同时也让人畅快地吃东西（这也是人生中的一大乐事）。"
"A sick stomach induces scepticism unbelief, nightmares and the desire for death.","坏的肠胃让人产生怀疑的想法、做噩梦，甚至是产生轻生的念头。"
"I have often noticed this fact.","我经常注意到这一点。"
"Perhaps I would not kill myself, if my digestion had been good this evening.","要是今晚我的胃口很好的话，也许我就不会自杀了。"
"“When I sat down in the arm-chair where I have been sitting every day for thirty years, I glanced around me, and just then I was seized by such a terrible distress that I thought I must go mad.","“当我坐在30年来每天都坐的椅子上时，我环顾四周，就在那时，我陷入了一种巨大的悲伤，以为自己就要疯了。"
"“I tried to think of what I could do to run away from myself.","“于是我试图做点儿什么别的事情，以分散自己的注意力，让自己解脱出来。"
"Every occupation struck me as being worse even than inaction.","但每件事似乎只是火上浇油。"
"Then I bethought me of putting my papers in order.","于是我想整理一下自己的文件。"
"“For a long time I have been thinking of clearing out my drawers; for, for the last thirty years, I have been throwing my letters and bills pell-mell into the same desk, and this confusion has often caused me considerable trouble.","“很久以来，我就想着整理我的抽屉；因为30年来，我每次都把信件和账单杂乱无章地扔在那张桌子的抽屉里，而且这乱七八糟的状况总是给我带来极大的不便。"
"But I feel such moral and physical laziness at the sole idea of putting anything in order that I have never had the courage to begin this tedious business.","但是只要一想到要整理这些东西，我就觉得很麻烦，又懒得动手，因此一直以来都没勇气动手做这份乏味的工作。"
"“I therefore opened my desk, intending to choose among my old papers and destroy the majority of them.","“于是，我打开抽屉，想要找出一些原来的信件，再把其中大部分销毁掉。"
"“At first I was bewildered by this array of documents, yellowed by age, then I chose one.","“一开始，我被这一大摞年久泛黄的文件弄得有点儿不知所措，然后我从里面抽出了一张。"
"“Oh!","“天哪！"
"if you cherish life, never disturb the burial place of old letters!","如果你珍爱生活的话，千万别去碰这座埋葬着过去生活的书信的坟墓！"
"“And if, perchance, you should, take the contents by the handful, close your eyes that you may not read a word, so that you may not recognize some forgotten handwriting which may plunge you suddenly into a sea of memories; carry these papers to the fire; and when they are in ashes, crush them to an invisible powder, or otherwise you are lost—just as I have been lost for an hour.","“如果有可能的话，你就该一把把地抓起里面的信件，闭上眼睛，一个字也别看。这样你就不知道这信是谁写的，也就不会让你陷入回忆的海洋。把这些信扔入火中，待它们化为灰烬时，再将它们压成细细的粉末，完全分不清楚了——不然你就完了——就像我一个钟头以前完蛋了一样。"
"“The first letters which I read did not interest me greatly.","“我读的头几封信并没有引起我太大的兴趣。"
"They were recent, and came from living men whom I still meet quite often, and whose presence does not move me to any great extent.","那些信都是最近才收到的，写信的人现在也还都活在世上，我也经常可以见到他们，他们的出现也不会怎么打动我。"
"But all at once one envelope made me start.","可是突然有一封信让我震惊不已。"
"My name was traced on it in a large, bold handwriting; and suddenly tears came to my eyes.","信封上用那种大号且加粗的字体写着我的名字，于是，瞬间我的眼泪夺眶而出。"
"That letter was from my dearest friend, the companion of my youth, the confidant of my hopes; and he appeared before me so clearly, with his pleasant smile and his hand outstretched, that a cold shiver ran down my back.","那封信是我最亲爱的朋友写给我的，他是我青年时代的玩伴，也是我的知己至交。他的模样出现在我的眼前，是那么清晰，脸上带着和蔼的笑容，手伸展开来，这些景象使我不寒而栗。"
"Yes, yes, the dead come back, for I saw him!","是的，是的，是他回来了，我看到他了。"
"Our memory is a more perfect world than the universe: it gives back life to those who no longer exist."," 我们的记忆比起宇宙来说，是一个更为完美的世界：因为它可以让那些已经去世的人重生。"
"“With trembling hand and dimmed eyes I reread everything that he told me, and in my poor sobbing heart I felt a wound so painful that I began to groan as a man whose bones are slowly being crushed.","“我的手颤巍巍地拿着那封信，泪眼蒙眬地读着它，我那可怜清醒的心中感受到一股刺痛，我竟像饱受骨折折磨的病人一样呻吟起来。"
"“Then I travelled over my whole life, just as one travels along a river.","“然后我回顾着我的一生，如同一个人顺着江河漫游一样。"
"I recognized people, so long forgotten that I no longer knew their names.","我认出一些人，可惜时间过去的太久，我都记不起他们的名字了。"
"Their faces alone lived in me. In my mother’s letters I saw again the old servants, the shape of our house and the little insignificant odds and ends which cling to our minds.","而他们的面容依旧印在我的脑海里。在我妈妈的来信中，我仿佛再次看到过去的仆人，记起我们过去居住的房子的形状，还有许多其他琐碎的事物也浮现在眼前。"
"“Yes, I suddenly saw again all my mother’s old gowns, the different styles which she adopted and the several ways in which she dressed her hair.","“还有，我突然看到我妈妈曾经穿过的所有旧衣裙，都是那个时代流行的，还有她梳过的多种样式的发髻。"
"She haunted me especially in a silk dress, trimmed with old lace; and I remembered something she said one day when she was wearing this dress.","萦绕在我心头的尤其是她穿着一条丝绸裙子，裙子边上缀有旧花边；我想起了那天她穿这条裙子时对我说的话。"
"She said: ‘Robert, my child, if you do not stand up straight you will be round-shouldered all your life.’","她说：‘罗伯特，我亲爱的孩子，如果你不挺直腰板的话，你就会一辈子都是驼背。’"
"“Then, opening another drawer, I found myself face to face with memories of tender passions: a dancing-pump, a torn handkerchief, even a garter, locks of hair and dried flowers.","“接着，我打开了另一个抽屉，我看到了许多见证了昔日爱情的物件：一只舞鞋、一块破旧的手帕，甚至还有一个吊带、几绺头发和一些干花。"
"Then the sweet romances of my life, whose living heroines are now white-haired, plunged me into the deep melancholy of things.","我往日甜蜜爱情的女主角如今年已经是白发苍苍，这又把我陷入到深深的忧伤之中。"
"Oh, the young brows where blond locks curl, the caress of the hands, the glance which speaks, the hearts which beat, that smile which promises the lips, those lips which promise the embrace!","噢，垂在额前的卷曲的金色秀发、充满爱抚的双手、传情达意的眼神、怦怦跳动的心脏、允诺接吻的微笑和亲吻过后的拥抱，都到哪里去了呢！"
"And the first kiss-that endless kiss which makes you close your eyes, which drowns all thought in the immeasurable joy of approaching possession!","第一次的亲吻——停不下来的亲吻让人紧闭双眼，忘掉一切，只是享受着那种快要拥有对方的无限的快乐！"
"“Taking these old pledges of former love in both my hands, I covered them with furious caresses, and in my soul, torn by these memories, I saw them each again at the hour of surrender; and I suffered a torture more cruel than all the tortures invented in all the fables about hell.","“双手捧着往日爱情的旧信物，我发狂地抚摸着它们。在我饱受记忆摧残的内心里，在放弃之时我又再一次看到它们，而我受到的折磨远比寓言传说中描写的更为可怕残酷。"
"“One last letter remained.","“最后只剩下一封信了。"
"It was written by me and dictated fifty years ago by my writing teacher.","这封信是50年前我在书法老师口授下亲笔写的。"
"Here it is:","内容是这样的："
"“‘MY DEAR LITTLE MAMMA:","“‘我亲爱的妈妈："
"“‘I am seven years old to-day.","“‘今天我七岁了。"
"It is the age of reason.","是该明白事理的时候了。"
"I take advantage of it to thank you for having brought me into this world.","借此机会，我感谢您把我带入这个世界。"
"“‘Your little son, who loves you","“‘爱您的儿子，"
"“‘ROBERT.’","“‘罗伯特。’"
"“It is all over.","“一切都结束了。"
"I had gone back to the beginning, and suddenly I turned my glance on what remained to me of life.","我回溯到了人生的开端，突然我又把目光转向了生命中剩下的日子。"
"I saw hideous and lonely old age, and approaching infirmities, and everything over and gone.","我看到了丑恶的、孤独的老年，还有逐渐逼近的病痛，所有的东西都消失殆尽，不复存在。"
"And nobody near me!","没有人陪伴在我的身边！"
"“My revolver is here, on the table.","“我的手枪就在这里，就在桌子上。"
"I am loading it ... Never reread your old letters!”","我给手枪上膛了……记住千万不要回头看你过去的信件！”"
"And that is how many men come to kill themselves; and we search in vain to discover some great sorrow in their lives.","这就是为什么许多人自寻短见的理由，而我们去探索他们的生活，想要发现什么巨大的悲痛，一切都是徒然。"
