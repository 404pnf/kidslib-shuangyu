"Trusty John","忠实的约翰","质检"
"by Andrew Lang","作者：安德鲁·朗格"
"Once upon a time there was an old king who was so ill that he thought to himself, “I am most likely on my death-bed.”","从前，有一位老国王得了重病，于是他暗自思忖：“我很可能时日不多了。”"
"Then he said, “Send Trusty John to me.”","然后他说，“传忠实的约翰来我这儿。”"
"Now Trusty John was his favorite servant, and was so called because all his life he had served him so faithfully.","忠实的约翰是他最喜爱的仆人，之所以这么称呼他是因为他一生都非常忠诚地服侍着老国王。"
"When he approached the bed the King spake to him: “Most trusty John, I feel my end is drawing near, and I could face it without a care were it not for my son.","当他走近床前时，老国王对他说道：“我最忠实的约翰啊，我感觉我的大限就快到了，我本可以毫无顾虑地面对它，可我唯一放心不下的就是我的儿子。"
"He is still too young to decide everything for himself, and unless you promise me to instruct him in all he should know, and to be to him as a father, I shall not close my eyes in peace.”","他还太年轻，不能自己作决定，除非你答应我教会他所有应该了解的东西，就像他父亲那样，否则我无法安心瞑目。”"
"Then Trusty John answered: “I will never desert him, and will serve him faithfully, even though it should cost me my life.”","于是，忠实的约翰答道：“我决不会离他而去，我会忠诚地服侍他，即使以我的性命为代价。”"
"Then the old King said: “Now I die comforted and in peace”; and then he went on: “After my death you must show him the whole castle, all the rooms and apartments and vaults, and all the treasures that lie in them; but you must not show him the last room in the long passage, where the picture of the Princess of the Golden Roof is hidden.","然后，老国王说：“现在我可以安心平静地离去了。”然后，他接着说道：“我死后，你必须带他看一看整个城堡里的所有房间、套房和地下室，以及房子里的全部财宝。但是你不能让他看长廊尽头的最后一个房间，那儿藏着金屋顶公主的画像。"
"When he beholds that picture he will fall violently in love with it and go off into a dead faint, and for her sake he will encounter many dangers; you must guard him from this.”","当他看见画像时，会深深地爱上她，并且会突然昏倒，不省人事，也会因她身陷险境，你必须保护他免受危险。”"
"And when Trusty John had again given the King his hand upon it the old man became silent, laid his head on the pillow, and died.","当忠实的约翰再次就此向老国王发誓后，老人一言不发，将头靠在枕头上死去了。"
"When the old King had been carried to his grave Trusty John told the young King what he had promised his father on his death-bed, and added: “And I shall assuredly keep my word, and shall be faithful to you as I have been to him, even though it should cost me my life.”","等老国王下葬后，忠实的约翰告诉了年轻的国王自己在他父亲临终前的允诺，并补充道：“我一定会信守诺言，对你就像对老国王一样忠心，即使以牺牲自己的生命为代价。”"
"Now when the time of mourning was over, Trusty John said to him: “It is time you should see your inheritance.","等丧礼办完后，忠实的约翰对他说：“现在你该看看你继承的财产了。"
"I will show you your ancestral castle.”","我会带你去看你祖传的城堡。”"
"So he took him over everything, and let him see all the riches and splendid apartments, only the one room where the picture was he did not open.","于是，他带着年轻的国王将所有的东西都看了个遍，让他看了全部的财富和华丽的套房，唯独没有打开那间挂着画像的房子。"
"But the picture was placed so that if the door opened you gazed straight upon it, and it was so beautifully painted that you imagined it lived and moved, and that it was the most lovable and beautiful thing in the whole world.","但是，那幅画挂的位置使你一打开门就能一眼看见它。而且那幅画像画得如此之美，以至于你会幻想它是有生命的，它是全世界最可爱、最美丽的东西。"
"But the young King noticed that Trusty John always missed one door, and said: “Why do you never open this one for me?”","然而，年轻的国王发现忠实的约翰总是漏掉一间屋子，便说道：“为什么你从不为我打开这间屋子？”"
"“There is something inside that would appall you,” he answered.","“这里面有会使你感到恐惧的东西。”他答道。"
"But the King replied: “I have seen the whole castle, and shall find out what is in there”; and with these words he approached the door and wanted to force it open.","但国王回答道：“我已经看过整个城堡了，也要看看这里面究竟有什么。”说着，他走近那扇房门，想用力打开它。"
"But Trusty John held him back, and said: “I promised your father before his death that you shouldn’t see what that room contains.","可忠实的约翰阻止了他，说道：“在你父亲临终前我发过誓，你不能看这间房子里的东西。"
"It might bring both you and me to great grief.”","这可能会给你和我招致最大的不幸。”"
"“Ah! no,” answered the young King; “if I don’t get in, it will be my certain destruction; I should have no peace night or day till I had seen what was in the room with my own eyes.","“啊！不，”年轻的国王答道，“如果我不进去，才一定会毁了我，我会日夜不得安宁，直到我亲眼看见房间有什么东西为止。"
"Now I don’t budge from the spot till you have opened the door.”","现在，如果你不开门，我就寸步不移地站在这儿。”"
"Then Trusty John saw there was no way out of it, so with a heavy heart and many sighs he took the key from the big bunch.","于是，忠实的约翰见已经无计可施了，便忧心忡忡、唉声叹气地从一大串钥匙中拿出那一把。"
"When he had opened the door he stepped in first, and thought to cover the likeness so that the King might not perceive it; but it was hopeless: the King stood on tiptoe and looked over his shoulder.","当他打开门后，他先走了进去，希望能挡住画像，这样也许国王就看不到它，但这并不管用：国王踮起脚尖从他的肩头看了过去。"
"And when he saw the picture of the maid, so beautiful and glittering with gold and precious stones, he fell swooning to the ground.","当他看到少女的画像时，发现她是如此美丽动人，在金饰宝石的衬托下显得明艳夺目，他倒在地上昏了过去。"
"Trusty John lifted him up, carried him to bed, and thought sorrowfully: “The curse has come upon us; gracious heaven! what will be the end of it all?”","忠实的约翰把他扶了起来，将他抱到床上，痛苦地想着：“诅咒已经降临在我们身上了，仁慈的上帝啊！这一切将如何收场呢？”"
"Then he poured wine down his throat till he came to himself again.","然后他把酒灌给国王喝，直到他再次恢复意识。"
"The first words he spoke were: “Oh! who is the original of the beautiful picture?”","国王醒来说的第一句话就是：“噢！这幅美丽画像的真人是谁啊？”"
"“She is the Princess of the Golden Roof,” answered Trusty John.","“她是金屋顶国的公主。”忠实的约翰回答道。"
"Then the King continued: “My love for her is so great that if all the leaves on the trees had tongues they could not express it; my very life depends on my winning her.","国王接着说道：“我对她的爱是如此深沉，就算树上所有的叶子都变成舌头也难以表达我的爱。我生命的全部意义就在于赢得她的心。"
"You are my most trusty John: you must stand by me.”","你是我最忠实的约翰，你必须支持我。”"
"The faithful servant pondered long how they were to set about the matter, for it was said to be difficult even to get into the presence of the Princess.","这位忠实的仆人沉思良久，他们该怎样着手处理这件事情，因为据说就算是要找到公主的所在之处都很困难。"
"At length he hit upon a plan, and spoke to the King: “All the things she has about her—tables, chairs, dishes, goblets, bowls, and all her household furniture—are made of gold.","最后，他终于想到了一个计划，并对国王说：“她周围所有的东西都是金子做的：桌子、凳子、盘子、酒杯、碗和一切家庭用具都是金质的。"
"You have in your treasure five tons of gold; let the goldsmiths of your kingdom manufacture them into all manner of vases and vessels, into all sorts of birds and game and wonderful beasts; that will please her.","你的财产里有五吨黄金，让你国家的金匠们把它们全做成各种花瓶和容器，做成各种珍禽异兽和游戏用具，那会让她欣喜不已。"
"We shall go to her with them and try our luck.”","我们带着这些去找她，去试试运气吧。”"
"The King summoned all his goldsmiths, and they had to work hard day and night, till at length the most magnificent things were completed.","国王下令找来了所有的金匠，他们夜以继日地工作，直到最后终于做成了最华丽的珍玩。"
"When a ship had been laden with them the faithful John disguised himself as a merchant, and the King had to do the same, so that they should be quite unrecognizable.","等这些珍玩装满了一艘船后，忠实的约翰把自己伪装成了商人，国王也不得不如此，这样他们就不会被认出来了。"
"And so they crossed the seas and journeyed till they reached the town where the Princess of the Golden Roof dwelt.","就这样，他们漂洋过海，一直航行，直到到达了金屋顶公主居住的城镇。"
"Trusty John made the King remain behind on the ship and await his return.","忠实的约翰让国王在船上等着他回来。"
"“Perhaps,” he said, “I may bring the Princess back with me, so see that everything is in order; let the gold ornaments be arranged and the whole ship decorated.”","“也许，”他说，“我有可能把公主带回来，因此，你们要确保船上一切整齐，将金器摆放出来，把整艘船装饰好。”"
"Then he took a few of the gold things in his apron, went ashore, and proceeded straight to the palace.","接着，他拿出一些金器放进篮子里，上岸直接去了宫殿。"
"When he came to the courtyard he found a beautiful maiden standing at the well, drawing water with two golden pails.","当他来到宫殿的庭院时，看见井边站着一位美丽的少女，正用两个金水桶打水。"
"And as she was about to carry away the glittering water she turned round and saw the stranger, and asked him who he was.","正当她准备担着波光粼粼的水转身离开时，她看见了这个陌生人，并问他是谁。"
"Then he replied: “I am a merchant,” and opening his apron, he let her peep in.","于是他答道：“我是一个商人。”一边打开了他的篮子，让少女看里面的东西。"
"“Oh! my,” she cried; “what beautiful gold wares!” she set down her pails, and examined one thing after the other.","“嗬！天呐，”她叫道，“多么漂亮的金器啊！”她放下水桶，一件接着一件地仔细看着。"
"Then she said: “The Princess must see this, she has such a fancy for gold things that she will buy up all you have.”","然后她说：“一定得让公主看看，她太喜欢金器了，一定会把这些全部买下来的。”"
"She took him by the hand and let him into the palace, for she was the lady’s maid.","她牵着他的手，把他带进了皇宫，因为她是公主的侍女。"
"When the Princess had seen the wares she was quite enchanted, and said: “They are all so beautifully made that I shall buy everything you have.”","当公主看过这些金器后，被彻底地迷住了，她说：“它们做得太漂亮了，我要把这些全买下来。”"
"But Trusty John said: “I am only the servant of a rich merchant, what I have here is nothing compared to what my master has on his ship; his merchandise is more artistic and costly than anything that has ever been made in gold before.”","可忠实的约翰说：“我只是一位富商的仆人，现在我有的这些和我主人放在船上的比起来，根本算不了什么。他的商品比之前用金子做成的任何东西都要精美昂贵。”"
"She desired to have everything brought up to her, but he said: “There is such a quantity of things that it would take many days to bring them up, and they would take up so many rooms that you would have no space for them in your house.”","公主想要他把所有的东西都带来给她，但约翰说道：“那儿的东西太多了，以至于要花上许多天才能带下船，而且它们会占用太多的房间，可能你的房子都放不下。”"
"Thus her desire and curiosity were excited to such an extent that at last she said: “Take me to your ship; I shall go there myself and view your master’s treasures.”","这样，她的欲望和好奇心被极大地激发了，最终她说道：“带我去你们的船上，我要亲自去看看你主人的珍宝。”"
"Then Trusty John was quite delighted, and brought her to the ship; and the King, when he beheld her, saw that she was even more beautiful than her picture, and thought every moment that his heart would burst.","于是，忠实的约翰欣喜不已，把公主带到了船上。当国王看到她，发现她甚至比画像上还美时，觉得自己的心时刻都会从胸膛迸出来。"
"She stepped on to the ship, and the King led her inside.","她刚踏上了船，国王便领着她进去了。"
"But Trusty John remained behind with the steersman, and ordered the ship to push off.","但是忠实的约翰一直呆在船尾和舵手一起，并命令他马上起航离开。"
"“Spread all sail, that we may fly on the ocean like a bird in the air.”","“张满所有风帆，让我们在海上飞翔，就像鸟儿在空中飞行一样。”"
"Meanwhile the King showed the Princess inside all his gold wares, every single bit of it—dishes, goblets, bowls, the birds and game, and all the wonderful beasts.","与此同时，国王在船舱里向公主展示他所有的金器，一件也没落下——碟子、酒杯、游戏用具和奇珍异兽等。"
"Many hours passed thus, and she was so happy that she did not notice that the ship was sailing away.","数小时过去了，她太开心了以至于根本没有注意到船已经起航离开了。"
"After she had seen the last thing she thanked the merchant and prepared to go home; but when she came to the ship’s side she saw that they were on the high seas, far from land, and that the ship was speeding on its way under full canvas.","当她看完最后一件金器后，对商人表示谢意，并准备回家；但是当她走到船边时，发现他们已经远离陆地，置身茫茫大海，而船已经张满风帆极速航行。"
"“Oh!” she cried in terror, “I am deceived, carried away and betrayed into the power of a merchant; I would rather have died!”","“噢！”她惊恐地喊道，“我被蒙骗了，被拐走了，被诱骗落入了一个商人的掌控之中，我宁可去死！”"
"But the King seized her hand and spake: “I am no merchant, but a king of as high birth as yourself; and it was my great love for you that made me carry you off by stratagem.","但国王却拉住她的手说道：“我不是一个商人，而是一个出身和你一样高贵的国王。是我对你那深沉的爱驱使我用计谋将你带了出来。"
"The first time I saw your likeness I fell to the ground in a swoon.”","第一眼看到你的画像时，我就昏倒在地上。”"
"When the Princess of the Golden Roof heard this she was comforted, and her heart went out to him, so that she willingly consented to become his wife.","当金屋顶公主听到这一切后，才放下心来，并倾心于国王，所以她欣然同意成为他的妻子。"
"Now it happened one day, while they were sailing on the high seas, that Trusty John, sitting on the forepart of the ship, fiddling away to himself, observed three ravens in the air flying toward him.","一天，当他们航行在茫茫大海上时，忠实的约翰坐在船头独自拉着小提琴，恰好看到三只渡鸦在空中朝他飞过来。"
"He ceased playing, and listened to what they were saying, for he understood their language.","因为他懂得鸟语，所以他停止了弹奏，听它们的谈话。"
"The one croaked: “Ah, ha! so he’s bringing the Princess of the Golden Roof home.”","第一只渡鸦呱呱地叫道：“啊哈！他正把金屋顶公主带回家呢！”"
"“Yes,” answered the second, “but he’s not got her yet.”","“是啊，”第二渡鸦答道，“可是他还是得不到她。”"
"“Yes, he has,” spake the third, “for she’s sitting beside him on the ship.”","“不，他已经得到了，”第三只渡鸦说，“因为他俩在船上坐在一块儿呢！”"
"Then number one began again and cried: “That’ll not help him!","第一只渡鸦又开始叫了起来：“这对他也无济于事！"
"When they reach the land a chestnut horse will dash forward to greet them: the King will wish to mount it, and if he does it will gallop away with him, and disappear into the air, and he will never see his bride again.”","当他们到岸时，一只栗色的马会向他们飞奔而来：国王会想骑上那匹马，如果他这么做的话，那匹马会载着他疾驰而去，消失在空中，而他再也见不到他的妻子了。”"
"“Is there no escape for him?” asked number two.","“难道就没有脱险的办法吗？”第二只渡鸦问道。"
"“Oh! yes, if someone else mounts quickly and shoots the horse dead with the pistol that is sticking in the holster, then the young King is saved.","“噢！有！如果有人快速地坐上那匹马，拔出插在手枪皮套里的手枪开枪把马射死，这样年轻的国王就得救了。"
"But who’s to do that?","但是谁会那样做呢？"
"And anyone who knows it and tells him will be turned into stone from his feet to his knees.”","任何知道此事并将它告诉国王的人，他的腿部到膝盖都会变成石头。”"
"Then spake number two: “I know more than that: even if the horse is slain, the young King will still not keep his bride: when they enter the palace together they will find a ready-made wedding shirt in a cupboard, which looks as though it were woven of gold and silver, but is really made of nothing but sulphur and tar: when the King puts it on it will burn him to his marrow and bones.”","接着，第二只乌鸦说道：“我知道的事情比这还多呢，就算那匹马死了，年轻的国王还是无法得到他的新娘：当他们一起进入宫殿时，会看到在衣橱上摆着一件现成的新婚礼服，看起来就像是用金银编织而成，但其实只是由硫黄和沥膏做成的：等国王穿上它时，就会被烧到骨髓里去。”"
"Number three asked: “Is there no way of escape, then?”","第三只渡鸦问：“难道就没有脱险的办法吗？”"
"“Oh! yes,” answered number two: “If someone seizes the shirt with gloved hands and throws it into the fire, and lets it burn, then the young King is saved.","“噢！有！”第二只渡鸦说：“如果有人用戴手套的手抓起礼服将它扔到火堆里，让它烧起来，那么年轻的国王就得救了。"
"But what’s the good?","但是这有什么用呢？"
"Anyone knowing this and telling it will have half his body turned into stone, from his knees to his heart.”","只要有人知道这事，并告诉别人，那么他身体的一半，从膝盖到心脏都会变成石头。”"
"Then number three spake: “I know yet more: though the bridal shirt too be burnt, the King hasn’t even then secured his bride: when the dance is held after the wedding, and the young Queen is dancing, she will suddenly grow deadly white, and drop down like one dead, and unless some one lifts her up and draws three drops of blood from her right side, and spits them out again, she will die.","于是，第三只渡鸦又说道：“我知道得更多：即使新郎的礼服被烧了，国王到了那时仍然得不到新娘：婚礼结束后，当舞会举行，年轻的皇后开始跳舞时，她的脸色会突然苍白得像个死人，昏倒在地上，就像死了一样，除非有人扶起她，从她的身体右侧吸出三滴血并吐掉，"
"But if anyone who knows this betrays it, he will be turned into stone from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet.”","但只要有人知道此事，并把它说出去，他就会全身从头顶到脚尖都变成石头。”"
"When the ravens had thus conversed they fled onward, but Trusty John had taken it all in, and was sad and depressed from that time forward; for if he were silent to his master concerning what he had heard, he would involve him in misfortune; but if he took him into his confidence, then he himself would forfeit his life.","渡鸦们交谈完后便飞走了，但是忠实的约翰已经听到了全部的对话，从那时开始他就感到忧郁而悲伤，因为如果他把听到的一切都对主人保密，就会使主人陷入不幸；但如果他将此事全部告诉主人，那么他自己就会丢掉性命。"
"At last he said: “I will stand by my master, though it should be my ruin.”","最后，他说：“我会对主人忠心的，哪怕这意味着失去我的性命。”"
"Now when they drew near the land it came to pass just as the ravens had predicted, and a splendid chestnut horse bounded forward.","当他们靠近陆地时，渡鸦预言的事情发生了，一匹漂亮的栗色的马跳了出来。"
"“Capital!”","“好极了！”"
"said the King; “this animal shall carry me to my palace,” and was about to mount, but Trusty John was too sharp for him, and, springing up quickly, seized the pistol out of the holster and shot the horse dead.","国王说道，“这家伙会把我载回宫殿的。”说完正准备上马，可忠实的约翰反应太快了，迅速地跳上马，抽出手枪皮套里的手枪把马射死了。"
"Then the other servants of the King, who at no time looked favorably on Trusty John, cried out: “What a sin to kill the beautiful beast that was to bear the King to his palace!”","于是，国王其他的仆人因为一直看忠实的约翰不顺眼，就大喊道：“他杀了要载国王回宫的马，实在是罪大恶极！”"
"But the King spake: “Silence! let him alone; he is ever my most trusty John.","但国王却说道：“安静！随他去吧，他是我最忠实的约翰。"
"Who knows for what good end he may have done this thing?”","谁知道他这么做不是为了有好的结果呢？”"
"So they went on their way and entered the palace, and there in the hall stood a cupboard in which lay the ready-made bridal shirt, looking for all the world as though it were made of gold and silver.","于是他们继续上路，来到了宫殿，在大厅里有一个衣橱，上面摆着一件现成的新郎婚礼服，在所有人看来，它好像是用金银做成的。"
"The young King went toward it and was about to take hold of it, but Trusty John, pushing him aside, seized it with his gloved hands, threw it hastily into the fire, and let it burn The other servants commenced grumbling again, and said: “See, he’s actually burning the King’s bridal shirt.”","年轻的国王向礼服走去，正准备拿起它时，忠实约翰把他推到一边，用戴手套的双手抓起礼服，匆忙地扔进了火堆里，让它烧了起来。其他的仆人又开始嘟囔着说道：“瞧吧，他这是在烧国王的新郎礼服呢。”"
"But the young King spoke: “Who knows for what good purpose he does it?","可年轻的国王说：“谁又知道他这么做不是出于好意呢？"
"Let him alone, he is my most trusty John.”","随他去吧，他是我最忠实的约翰。”"
"Then the wedding was celebrated, the dance began, and the bride joined in, but Trusty John watched her countenance carefully.","人们庆祝完婚礼后，舞会开始了，新娘也加入进来，可忠实的约翰全神贯注地盯着她的脸。"
"Of a sudden she grew deadly white, and fell to the ground as if she were dead.","突然，她的脸色苍白得像个死人，倒在地上像死了一样。"
"He at once sprang hastily toward her, lifted her up, and bore her to a room, where he laid her down, and kneeling beside her he drew three drops of blood from her right side, and spat them out.","他立刻迅速地向她跃去，将她扶起，并抱着她到一间房子里，让她躺下，他跪在一旁，从她的身体右侧吸出三滴血，吐了出来。"
"She soon breathed again and came to herself; but the young King had watched the proceeding, and not knowing why Trusty John had acted as he did, he flew into a passion, and cried: “Throw him into prison.”","她很快又开始呼吸，恢复了意识，但是年轻的国王已经看到了全部过程，他不明白为什么忠实的约翰要这么做，他勃然大怒，喊道：“把他关到牢里去。”"
"On the following morning sentence was passed on Trusty John, and he was condemned to be hanged.","第二天早上，忠实的约翰的判决被宣布，他被判了绞刑。"
"As he stood on the gallows he said: “Every one doomed to death has the right to speak once before he dies; and I too have that privilege?”","当他站在绞架上时，他说道：“每个将死之人都有权在临死前说些话，我也有那样的特权吗？”"
"“Yes,” said the King, “it shall be granted to you.”","“是的，”国王说道，“我准许你的要求。”"
"So Trusty John spoke: “I am unjustly condemned, for I have always been faithful to you”; and he proceeded to relate how he had heard the ravens’ conversation on the sea, and how he had to do all he did in order to save his master.","于是，忠实的约翰说：“我受到了不公正的判决，因为我一直对你忠心耿耿。”接着，他继续将自己在海上听到渡鸦们的谈话，以及为了拯救自己的主人他迫不得已所做的事情全部都说了出来。"
"Then the King cried: “Oh! my most trusty John, pardon! pardon!","国王听完后大喊道：“噢！我最忠实的约翰，原谅我！原谅我！"
"Take him down.”","把他放下来。”"
"But as he uttered the last word Trusty John had fallen lifeless to the ground, and was a stone.","可是当忠实的约翰说完最后一个字的时候，他倒了下，去失去了知觉，变成了一块石头。"
"The King and Queen were in despair, and the King spake: “Ah! how ill have I rewarded such great fidelity!” and made them lift up the stone image and place it in his bedroom near his bed.","国王和王后都十分绝望，国王说道：“天呐！我竟然用如此恶劣的方式来回报你的忠诚！”然后命人把石像抬起来，放到他卧室的床边。"
"As often as he looked at it he wept and said: “Oh! if I could only restore you to life, my most trusty John!”","只要他看到石像就会哀悼，并说：“唉！要是我能让你复活该有多好，我忠实的约翰！”"
"After a time the Queen gave birth to twins, two small sons, who throve and grew, and were a constant joy to her.","过了不久，王后生下了一对双胞胎儿子，他们茁壮成长，让她时常感到欣慰不已。"
"One day when the Queen was at church, and the two children sat and played with their father, he gazed again full of grief on the stone statue, and sighing, wailed: “Oh, if I could only restore you to life, my most trusty John!”","一天，当王后去了教堂时，两个孩子和他们的父亲坐在一起玩耍，他又一次悲痛万分地望着石像，一边叹气，一边哭泣着说：“唉！我忠实的约翰，要是我能让你复活那该有多好！”"
"Suddenly the stone began to speak, and said: “Yes, you can restore me to life again if you are prepared to sacrifice what you hold most dear.”","突然，石像开始说话了，它说道：“是，你可以让我再次复活，如果你打算为了我牺牲你最珍视的人。”"
"And the King cried out: “All I have in the world will I give up for your sake.”","国王喊道：“为了你，我愿意放弃我在世上所拥有的一切。”"
"The stone continued: “If you cut off with your own hand the heads of your two children, and smear me with their blood, I shall come back to life.”","石像接着说道：“如果你亲手砍下你两个孩子的头，并把他们的血洒在我身上，我就会复活。”"
"The King was aghast when he heard that he had himself to put his children to death; but when he thought of Trusty John’s fidelity, and how he had even died for him, he drew his sword, and with his own hand cut the heads off his children.","听到他要亲手杀了自己的孩子时，国王感到惊骇不已，但是当他想到忠实的约翰的忠诚，以及他是怎样为自己牺牲时，他拔出了他的剑，亲手砍下了孩子们的头。"
"And when he had smeared the stone with their blood, life came back, and Trusty John stood once more safe and sound before him.","而当他将孩子们的血洒在石像上时，忠实的约翰复活了，又一次安然无恙地站在了国王面前。"
"He spake to the King: “Your loyalty shall be rewarded,” and taking up the heads of the children, he placed them on their bodies, smeared the wounds with their blood, and in a minute they were all right again and jumping about as if nothing had happened.","他对国王说：“你的忠诚将得到报答。”说完，他将孩子们的头重新放到他们的身体上，将血洒在了伤口处，不一会儿，他们又安然无恙，活蹦乱跳起来，就像什么也没发生过一样。"
"Then the King was full of joy, and when he saw the Queen coming, he hid Trusty John and the two children in a big cupboard.","于是，国王欢喜不已，当他看到王后回来时，把忠实的约翰和两个孩子藏在了大衣橱里。"
"As she entered he said to her: “Did you pray in church?”","当她走进来时，他对她说：“你在教堂祈祷了吗？”"
"“Yes,” she answered, “but my thoughts dwelt constantly on Trusty John, and of what he has suffered for us.”","“是的，”她答道：“但是我总是想着忠实的约翰，想着他为我们遭受的一切。”"
"Then he spake: “Dear wife, we can restore him to life, but the price asked is our two little sons; we must sacrifice them.”","于是他说：“亲爱的夫人，我们可以让他复活，但是代价是我们两个孩子，我们必须牺牲他们。”"
"The Queen grew white and her heart sank, but she replied: “We owe it to him on account of his great fidelity.”","王后脸色变得苍白，心也沉了下来，但她答道：“他的忠诚十分，我们亏欠他的。”"
"Then he rejoiced that she was of the same mind as he had been, and going forward he opened the cupboard, and fetched the two children and Trusty John out, saying: “God be praised!","于是，国王欣喜不已，因为王后的想法和他的一样，然后他跑去打开了衣橱，将两个孩子和忠实的约翰放了出来，说道：“谢天谢地！"
"Trusty John is free once more, and we have our two small sons again.”","忠实的约翰又一次获得了自由，我们两个小儿子也失而复得。”"
"Then he related to her all that had passed, and they lived together happily ever afterward. ","接着他把发生的事情全部告诉了王后，于是，他们从此以后快乐地生活在了一起。"
