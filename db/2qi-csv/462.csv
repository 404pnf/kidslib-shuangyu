"The Pride of the Cities","城市的骄傲"
"by O. Henry","作者：欧·亨利"
"Said Mr. Kipling, “The cities are full of pride, challenging each to each.”","吉卜林先生曾经说过：“城市充满了骄傲，互相之间不断竞争。”"
"Even so.","确实如此。"
"New York was empty.","纽约城空空如也。"
"Two hundred thousand of its people were away for the summer.","城里的20万居民都外出避暑去了。"
"Three million eight hundred thousand remained as caretakers and to pay the bills of the absentees.","剩下的380万居民留守，替那些外出的人买单。"
"But the two hundred thousand are an expensive lot.","可是，那20万人花销巨大。"
"The New Yorker sat at a roof-garden table, ingesting solace through a straw.","一个纽约人坐在屋顶花园的一张桌子旁，用一根麦秆吸着饮料聊以慰藉。"
"His panama lay upon a chair.","他的巴拿马草帽放在一把椅子上。"
"The July audience was scattered among vacant seats as widely as outfielders when the champion batter steps to the plate.","七月里，席间的观众零零散散，就像棒球比赛中，一个冠军击球手踏上本垒时，外场手总是散得很开那样。"
"Vaudeville happened at intervals.","中间时不时穿插着几场杂耍表演。"
"The breeze was cool from the bay; around and above—everywhere except on the stage—were stars.","海湾吹来的凉风，甚是宜人，而四周的天空中——除了舞台以外——到处都是璀璨的群星。"
"Glimpses were to be had of waiters, always disappearing, like startled chamois.","偶尔可以看见侍者的身影，然而他们就像受惊的小羚羊似的，转眼就消失了。"
"Prudent visitors who had ordered refreshments by ‘phone in the morning were now being served.","有远见的客人早上就通过电话预定好了点心，而此时他们正在享用。"
"The New Yorker was aware of certain drawbacks to his comfort, but content beamed softly from his rimless eyeglasses.","这位纽约人虽然觉得没有得到十足的舒适，但是无框眼镜的后面仍然流露出满意的神情。"
"His family was out of town.","他的家人都不在城里。"
"The drinks were warm; the ballet was suffering from lack of both tune and talcum—but his family would not return until September.","饮料不够冷，芭蕾舞表演的曲子选得不好，演员的化妆粉也扑得不够——但是他的家人得到九月份才能回来。"
"Then up into the garden stumbled the man from Topaz City, Nevada.","这时，来自内华达州托珀兹城的客人，跌跌撞撞地爬上了屋顶花园。"
"The gloom of the solitary sightseer enwrapped him.","孤独游客的忧郁笼罩着他。"
"Bereft of joy through loneliness, he stalked with a widower’s face through the halls of pleasure.","这孤独夺走了他的欢乐，他带着鳏夫似的表情穿过欢乐的大厅。"
"Thirst for human companionship possessed him as he panted in the metropolitan draught.","在大都市的气息中，他气喘吁吁，渴望着人类的友谊。"
"Straight to the New Yorker’s table he steered.","他朝着纽约人坐的那张桌子径直走去。"
"The New Yorker, disarmed and made reckless by the lawless atmosphere of a roof garden, decided upon utter abandonment of his life’s traditions.","屋顶花园无拘无束的氛围解除了纽约人的武装，他变得毫无顾忌，决意放弃老旧的生活传统。"
"He resolved to shatter with one rash, dare-devil, impulsive, hair-brained act the conventions that had hitherto been woven into his existence.","他不顾一切、轻率鲁莽地决心彻底粉碎迄今为止融入他生活中的那些惯例。"
"Carrying out this radical and precipitous inspiration he nodded slightly to the stranger as he drew nearer the table.","在这样的兴致中，他朝走上前来的这位陌生人微微地点了点头。"
"The next moment found the man from Topaz City in the list of the New Yorker’s closest friends.","很快，来自托珀兹城的人便成为了纽约人最亲密的朋友之一。"
"He took a chair at the table, he gathered two others for his feet, he tossed his broad-brimmed hat upon a fourth, and told his life’s history to his new-found pard.","他在桌子旁的一把椅子上坐下，拉了两把椅子用来搭脚，又把他的宽檐帽子扔在了第四把椅子上，向他的新伙伴介绍起自己的身世。"
"The New Yorker warmed a little, as an apartment-house furnace warms when the strawberry season begins.","纽约人感到了一丝温暖，就像感受到草莓盛季到来时公寓房间里的壁炉带来的温暖一样。"
"A waiter who came within hail in an unguarded moment was captured and paroled on an errand to the Doctor Wiley experimental station.","一位侍者一不留神走到能被召唤的距离，被他们叫住，派去到威利博士试验舞团去点节目。"
"The ballet was now in the midst of a musical vagary, and danced upon the stage programmed as Bolivian peasants, clothed in some portions of its anatomy as Norwegian fisher maidens, in others as ladies-in-waiting of Marie Antoinette, historically denuded in other portions so as to represent sea nymphs, and presenting the tout ensemble of a social club of Central Park West housemaids at a fish fry.","芭蕾舞团正在跳一支曲风变幻莫测的舞蹈，台上的演员装扮成玻利维亚的农民，身上穿的服装部分像挪威渔家女那样遮盖得严严实实，部分则如同玛丽·安托瓦尼特的侍女，根历史记载，她们衣着暴露，如同神话中的女海妖一般。整体效果如同中央公园西部的社交俱乐部的女仆在享用煎鱼一样。"
"“Been in the city long?” inquired the New Yorker, getting ready the exact tip against the waiter’s coming with large change from the bill.","“来城里很久了吗？”纽约人一边问，一边准备小额的零钱付给侍者小费，以防找回来的零钱总是一些大票。"
"“Me?” said the man from Topaz City.","“我吗？”来自托珀兹城的人说，"
"“Four days.","“四天。"

"I had a brother who died on Ninth, but I met the cortege at Eighth.","我有一个哥哥死在第九大街，但是我是在第八大街和送葬队伍汇合的。"
"There was a bunch of violets on the hearse, and the undertaker mentioned the incident to avoid mistake.","送葬者为避免我走错，特意在灵车上放了一束紫罗兰。"

"“Topaz City,” said the man who occupied four chairs, “is one of the finest towns in the world.”","“托珀兹城，”那个占了四把椅子的人说，“可以说是世上最好的城市之一。”"
"“I presume that you have seen the sights of the metropolis,” said the New Yorker, “Four days is not a sufficient length of time in which to view even our most salient points of interest, but one can possibly form a general impression.","“我想你在纽约这座大都市里大概已经游览了一些地方了吧，”纽约人说，“四天时间不够参观我们最出名的景点，但是应该能有一个大致的印象。"
