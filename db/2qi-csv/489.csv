"Felicia and the Pot Of Pinks","费利西娅与一盆石竹花"
"by Andrew Lang","作者：安德鲁·朗格"
"Once upon a time there was a poor laborer who, feeling that he had not much longer to live, wished to divide his possessions between his son and daughter, whom he loved dearly.","很久很久以前，有一位贫穷的劳工，因为感觉到自己活不了多久了，便想把自己的财产分给他深爱的儿子和女儿。"
"So he called them to him, and said: “Your mother brought me as her dowry two stools and a straw bed; I have, besides, a hen, a pot of pinks, and a silver ring, which were given me by a noble lady who once lodged in my poor cottage.","于是他把他们叫到跟前来，说：“你们的母亲带来了两张凳子、一张稻草床作为嫁妆；另外，我还有一只母鸡，一盆石竹花和一枚银戒指，这些都是一位曾经在我破旧的小屋里寄宿过的高贵女士送给我的。"
"When she went away she said to me:","当她离开的时候，她对我说："
"“‘Be careful of my gifts, good man; see that you do not lose the ring or forget to water the pinks.","“‘善良的先生，小心保管我的礼物；一定别弄丢了戒指，或忘了给石竹花浇水。"
"As for your daughter, I promise you that she shall be more beautiful than anyone you ever saw in your life; call her Felicia, and when she grows up give her the ring and the pot of pinks to console her for her poverty.’","至于您的女儿，我向您保证，她会比您一生中见过的所有人都要美丽；叫她费利西娅吧，等她长大了，就把这枚戒指和这盆石竹花交给她，来抚慰她的贫困。’"
"Take them both, then, my dear child,” he added, “and your brother shall have everything else.”","我亲爱的孩子，那你就把这两样东西带走吧，”他又说道，“其他的东西都归你哥哥所有了。”"
"The two children seemed quite contented, and when their father died they wept for him, and divided his possessions as he had told them.","两个孩子看上去都非常满意。父亲去世时，他们为他哭泣，并按照他的遗言分了遗产。"
"Felicia believed that her brother loved her, but when she sat down upon one of the stools he said angrily:","费利西娅相信哥哥是爱她的，但是当她坐在其中一张凳子上时，他生气地说："
"“Keep your pot of pinks and your ring, but let my things alone.","“看好你的石竹花和戒指，别碰我的东西。"
"I like order in my house.”","我喜欢我屋里的东西整整齐齐的。”"
"Felicia, who was very gentle, said nothing, but stood up crying quietly; while Bruno, for that was her brother’s name, sat comfortably by the fire.","性情温和的费利西娅没有说什么，只是站起来轻声哭泣；而她的哥哥布鲁诺则舒服地坐在火炉旁。"
"Presently, when supper-time came, Bruno had a delicious egg, and he threw the shell to Felicia, saying:","不久，晚饭时间到了，布鲁诺吃了一只美味的鸡蛋，他还把蛋壳丢给费利西娅，说道："
"“There, that is all I can give you; if you don’t like it, go out and catch frogs; there are plenty of them in the marsh close by.”","“给，我只能给你这个；如果你不喜欢，那么就出去抓青蛙吧；附近的沼泽有很多青蛙呢。”"
"Felicia did not answer, but she cried more bitterly than ever, and went away to her own little room.","费利西娅没有答话，却比之前哭得更伤心了，然后她回到了自己的小屋。"
"She found it filled with the sweet scent of the pinks, and, going up to them, she said sadly:","她发现小屋里弥漫着石竹花那甜美的芳香，然后，她走到它们跟前，悲伤地说道："
"“Beautiful pinks, you are so sweet and so pretty, you are the only comfort I have left.","“美丽的石竹花，你们多么芬芳，多么漂亮啊，你们是我仅剩的安慰了。"
"Be very sure that I will take care of you, and water you well, and never allow any cruel hand to tear you from your stems.”","放心吧，我会照顾你们，好好给你们浇水，绝不让任何人将你们残忍地从花梗上扯下来的。”"
"As she leaned over them she noticed that they were very dry.","她俯下身，发现那些花十分干枯了。"
"So taking her pitcher, she ran off in the clear moonlight to the fountain, which was at some distance.","于是她拿着水罐，在皎洁的月光下跑向泉水边，那个泉离她住的地方并不近。"
"When she reached it she sat down upon the brink to rest, but she had hardly done so when she saw a stately lady coming toward her, surrounded by numbers of attendants.","她到了泉水那里，坐在水边要休息一下，但她刚坐定，就看到一位庄严高贵的女士朝自己走来，四周簇拥着许多侍从。"
"Six maids of honor carried her train, and she leaned upon the arm of another.","六个侍女拉着她的裙裾，还有一位搀扶着她。"
"When they came near the fountain a canopy was spread for her, under which was placed a sofa of cloth-of-gold, and presently a dainty supper was served, upon a table covered with dishes of gold and crystal, while the wind in the trees and the falling water of the fountain murmured the softest music.","当她们走近泉水时，一张华盖为她铺开，华盖下面放着一张金丝面沙发，不一会儿，一顿精致的晚餐就准备好了，摆有美食的桌子上放着各种用金子和水晶制成的餐具。此时，树木之间的风和淙淙流下的泉水轻轻发出的声音汇成最轻柔的音乐。"
"Felicia was hidden in the shade, too much astonished by all she saw to venture to move; but in a few moments the Queen said:","费利西娅藏在树阴下，对所看到的一切觉得十分惊讶，一动也不敢动；但没过多久，女王便说道："
"“I fancy I see a shepherdess near that tree; bid her come hither.”","“我好像看见那棵树旁有个牧羊女；请她到这里来吧。”"
"So Felicia came forward and saluted the Queen timidly, but with so much grace that all were surprised.","于是费利西娅走上前来，羞怯地向女王行礼，但她的举止如此优雅，让所有人都十分吃惊。"
"“What are you doing here, my pretty child?” asked the Queen.","“我美丽的孩子，你在这里做什么呢？”女王问道，"
"“Are you not afraid of robbers?”","“你不怕强盗吗？”"
"“Ah! madam,” said Felicia, “a poor shepherdess who has nothing to lose does not fear robbers.”","“啊！夫人，”费利西娅说，“一个一无所有的穷牧羊女不怕强盗。”"
"“You are not very rich, then?” said the Queen, smiling.","“那么，你不是很富有吧？”女王微笑着说道。"
"“I am so poor,” answered Felicia, “that a pot of pinks and a silver ring are my only possessions in the world.”","“我很穷，”费利西娅回答道，“我在世上唯一的财产是一盆石竹花和一枚银戒指。”"
"“But you have a heart,” said the Queen.","“但你有一颗心，”女王说，"
"“What should you say if anybody wanted to steal that?”","“如果有人想把它偷走，你会说什么呢？”"
"“I do not know what it is like to lose one’s heart, madam,” she replied; “but I have always heard that without a heart one cannot live, and if it is broken one must die; and in spite of my poverty I should be sorry not to live.”","“我不知道失去一颗心会怎样，夫人，”她回答道，“但我总听说一个人没了心就不能活，如果有人心碎了，他就必定会死去；尽管我贫穷，但要是不能活着，我应该会很难过的。”"
"“You are quite right to take care of your heart, pretty one,” said the Queen.","“美丽的孩子，照顾好自己的心十分正确，”女王说道，"
"“But tell me, have you supped?”","“但是告诉我，你吃过晚餐了吗？”"
"“No, madam,” answered Felicia; “my brother ate all the supper there was.”","“还没有，夫人，”费利西娅回答道，“我哥哥吃光了所有的晚餐。”"
"Then the Queen ordered that a place should be made for her at the table, and herself loaded Felicia’s plate with good things; but she was too much astonished to be hungry.","然后女王下令说应该给她在桌前安排一个座位，之后女王亲自往费利西娅的盘子里盛了各种美食；但费利西娅由于太过吃惊，倒不觉得饿了。"
"“I want to know what you were doing at the fountain so late?” said the Queen presently.","“我想知道这么晚了你还在泉水边做什么呢？”一会儿女王问道。"
"“I came to fetch a pitcher of water for my pinks, madam,” she answered, stooping to pick up the pitcher which stood beside her; but when she showed it to the Queen she was amazed to see that it had turned to gold, all sparkling with great diamonds, and the water, of which it was full, was more fragrant than the sweetest roses.","“我是来给我的石竹花打罐水的，夫人。”她一边回答，一边弯腰提起身旁的水罐；但当她把水罐拿给女王看的时候，她很吃惊地看到水罐变成了金罐，金罐上一颗颗大钻石闪闪发光，金水罐里盛满的水闻起来比最甜美的玫瑰花还要芬芳。"
"She was afraid to take it until the Queen said:"
"“It is yours, Felicia; go and water your pinks with it, and let it remind you that the Queen of the Woods is your friend.”","“它是你的了，费利西娅；拿它去浇灌你的石竹花吧，它会让你记得，森林女王是你的朋友。”"
"The shepherdess threw herself at the Queen’s feet, and thanked her humbly for her gracious words.","牧羊女跪倒在女王的脚旁，恭敬地感谢她那和蔼可亲的话语。"
"“Ah! madam,” she cried, “if I might beg you to stay here a moment I would run and fetch my pot of pinks for you—they could not fall into better hands.”","“啊！夫人，”她大声说道，“我能否请求您在这里暂留片刻，我跑去把我那盆石竹花给您拿来——它们找不到比您更合适的主人了。”"
"“Go, Felicia,” said the Queen, stroking her cheek softly; “I will wait here until you come back.”","“去吧，费利西娅，”女王一边说着一边轻抚着她的脸颊，“我会在这里等你回来。”"
"So Felicia took up her pitcher and ran to her little room, but while she had been away Bruno had gone in and taken the pot of pinks, leaving a great cabbage in its place.","于是费利西娅拿起她的水罐，跑回她的小房间，但在她外出的时候，布鲁诺进入了她的房间，并且把那盆石竹花拿走了，原来放花的地方只留下一颗大卷心菜。"
"When she saw the unlucky cabbage Felicia was much distressed, and did not know what to do; but at last she ran back to the fountain, and, kneeling before the Queen, said:","看着这棵倒霉的卷心菜，费利西娅十分难过，也不知道该做什么；但最终她还是跑回泉水边，跪在女王面前，说道："
"“Madam, Bruno has stolen my pot of pinks, so I have nothing but my silver ring; but I beg you to accept it as a proof of my gratitude.”","“夫人，布鲁诺偷走了我那盆石竹花，所以除了这枚银戒指以外，我一无所有了；但我还是请求您收下它，来表达我对您的感激之情。”"
"“But if I take your ring, my pretty shepherdess,” said the Queen, “you will have nothing left; and what will you do then?”","“可是，如果我拿走了你的戒指，我美丽的牧羊女，”女王说，“你就什么都没有了，那之后你怎么办呢？”"
"“Ah! madam,” she answered simply, “if I have your friendship I shall do very well.”","“啊！夫人，”她只说道，“如果拥有您的友谊，我就会过得很好。”"
"So the Queen took the ring and put it on her finger, and mounted her chariot, which was made of coral studded with emeralds, and drawn by six milk-white horses.","于是，女王接过戒指，并戴在了手指上，然后登上了那辆由六匹乳白色的马拉着的嵌有翡翠的珊瑚马车。"
"And Felicia looked after her until the winding of the forest path hid her from her sight, and then she went back to the cottage, thinking over all the wonderful things that had happened.","费利西娅目送她离开，直到森林小道的蜿蜒挡住了她的视线，她才转身走回小屋，不停回想着刚才发生的奇事。"
"The first thing she did when she reached her room was to throw the cabbage out of the window.","她回到房间做的第一件事就是把那棵卷心菜扔出了窗外。"
"But she was very much surprised to hear an odd little voice cry out: “Oh!","但她听到了古怪的声音轻轻哭喊，吓了她一跳，那声音喊道：“啊！"
"I am half killed!” and could not tell where it came from, because cabbages do not generally speak.","我差点儿摔死！”她不知道声音是哪里来的，因为通常卷心菜是不会说话的。"
"As soon as it was light, Felicia, who was very unhappy about her pot of pinks, went out to look for it, and the first thing she found was the unfortunate cabbage.","因为丢了那盆石竹花，费利西娅十分伤心。天一亮，她就出门寻找，而她找到的第一件东西就是那棵倒霉的卷心菜。"
"She gave it a push with her foot, saying: “What are you doing here, and how dared you put yourself in the place of my pot of pinks?”","她踢了它一下，说：“你在这里做什么，你竟敢占了我那盆石竹花的地方？”"
"“If I hadn’t been carried,” replied the cabbage, “you may be very sure that I shouldn’t have thought of going there.”","“要不是被搬过去，”卷心菜回答说，“请你相信，我从未想过去那里。”"
"It made her shiver with fright to hear the cabbage talk, but he went on:","听到卷心菜开口说话，她不禁吓得发抖，但他继续说道："
"“If you will be good enough to plant me by my comrades again, I can tell you where your pinks are at this moment—hidden in Bruno’s bed!”","“如果你够好心，再把我种回到我的伙伴们身边，我就能告诉你你的石竹花现在在哪里——它们藏在布鲁诺的床上！”"
"Felicia was in despair when she heard this, not knowing how she was to get them back.","听到这句话，费利西娅绝望了，她不知道自己如何才能把它们拿回来。"
"But she replanted the cabbage very kindly in his old place, and, as she finished doing it, she saw Bruno’s hen, and said, catching hold of it:","但她还是很好心地把那棵卷心菜种回原处，做完这一切之后，她看到了布鲁诺的母鸡，于是她抓住它，说："
"“Come here, horrid little creature! you shall suffer for all the unkind things my brother has done to me.”","“过来，讨厌的小东西！我哥哥对我做过的一切坏事都要算在你头上。”"
"“Ah! shepherdess,” said the hen, “don’t kill me; I am rather a gossip, and I can tell you some surprising things that you will like to hear.","“啊！牧羊女，”母鸡说道，“不要杀我；我非常爱说长道短，我能告诉你一些让人惊奇的事，你肯定喜欢听。"
"Don’t imagine that you are the daughter of the poor laborer who brought you up; your mother was a queen who had six girls already, and the King threatened that unless she had a son who could inherit his kingdom she should have her head cut off.","不要以为你是那个带大你的穷劳工的女儿；你的母亲是一位王后，她已经有六个女儿了，国王威胁说除非她能生一个儿子来继承他的王国，否则他就把她的头砍下来。"
"“So when the Queen had another little daughter she was quite frightened, and agreed with her sister (who was a fairy) to exchange her for the fairy’s little son.","“所以当王后又生了一个小女儿的时候，她很害怕，就跟她姐姐（她是个仙女）说好，拿那个孩子换仙女的小儿子。"
"Now the Queen had been shut up in a great tower by the King’s orders, and when a great many days went by and still she heard nothing from the Fairy she made her escape from the window by means of a rope ladder, taking her little baby with her.","由于国王的命令，王后现在被关在一座高塔里，许多许多天后，她还是没从仙女那里听到任何消息。她就带着她的孩子，用一架绳梯越窗逃走了。"
"After wandering about until she was half dead with cold and fatigue she reached this cottage.","她一直流浪，到这个小屋的时候，因为寒冷和疲惫她都快不行了。"
"I was the laborer’s wife, and was a good nurse, and the Queen gave you into my charge, and told me all her misfortunes, and then died before she had time to say what was to become of you.","我本是劳工的妻子，也是个称职的奶妈，王后就把你托付给我照料，并且把她所有不幸的遭遇都告诉了我，然后她还没来得及说你将来会变成什么样子，就去世了。"
"“As I never in all my life could keep a secret, I could not help telling this strange tale to my neighbors, and one day a beautiful lady came here, and I told it to her also.","“我这辈子连一个秘密都守不住，就忍不住向我的邻居讲了这个奇怪的故事。一天，一位美丽的女士来到这里，我把这个故事也告诉给了她。"
"When I had finished she touched me with a wand she held in her hand, and instantly I became a hen, and there was an end of my talking!","当我讲完故事的时候，她用手上握的一根魔杖碰了我一下，我就立刻变成了一只母鸡，从那时起我就再也不能说话了！"
"I was very sad, and my husband, who was out when it happened, never knew what had become of me.","我非常难过，而这一切发生的时候我丈夫还在外边，他也就永远没办法知道我出了什么事。"
"After seeking me everywhere he believed that I must have been drowned, or eaten up by wild beasts in the forest.","他到处找我都没找到，于是他觉得我肯定是淹死了，或者是被森林里的野兽给吞掉了。"
"That same lady came here once more, and commanded that you should be called Felicia, and left the ring and the pot of pinks to be given to you; and while she was in the house twenty-five of the King’s guards came to search for you, doubtless meaning to kill you; but she muttered a few words, and immediately they all turned into cabbages.","那个女士又来了一次，要求叫你费利西娅，然后专门为你留下了一枚戒指和一盆石竹花；她还在小屋里的时候，国王就派了二十五名守卫来搜寻你了，无疑是想杀了你；但她低声说了几个字，所有的守卫们就立刻变成了卷心菜。"
"It was one of them whom you threw out of your window yesterday.","昨天你扔出窗外的那棵卷心菜就是其中一个。"
"“I don’t know how it was that he could speak—I have never heard either of them say a word before, nor have I been able to do it myself until now.”","“我不知道它是如何能开口说话的——我之前从没听过它们中的任何一个说过一个字，我自己也是直到现在才能开口说话的。”"
"The Princess was greatly astonished at the hen’s story, and said kindly: “I am truly sorry for you, my poor nurse, and wish it was in my power to restore you to your real form.","对于老母鸡的故事，这位公主十分震惊，然后她和蔼地说：“我非常同情你，我可怜的奶妈，我真希望自己有能力把你变回原来的样子。"
"But we must not despair; it seems to me, after what you have told me, that something must be going to happen soon.","但我们一定不能绝望；在听完你给我讲的这一切后，我感觉马上就要会有一些事情发生了。"
"Just now, however, I must go and look for my pinks, which I love better than anything in the world.”","然而，眼下我必须去找我的石竹花，因为我爱它们胜过爱世上的任何东西。”"
"Bruno had gone out into the forest, never thinking that Felicia would search in his room for the pinks, and she was delighted by his unexpected absence, and thought to get them back without further trouble.","布鲁诺已经离开家进了森林，他从没想到费利西娅会在他的房间里找石竹花。他的突然外出让她很高兴，她想把那些花拿回来，同时不惹来更多的麻烦。"
"But as soon as she entered the room she saw a terrible army of rats, who were guarding the straw bed; and when she attempted to approach it they sprang at her, biting and scratching furiously.","但她一进房间，就看到一大群可怕的老鼠，它们正守卫着那张稻草床；当她试图向床靠近时，那些老鼠朝她跳去，凶悍地对她又咬又抓。"
"Quite terrified, she drew back, crying out: “Oh! my dear pinks, how can you stay here in such bad company?”","她非常害怕，便退了回来，嘴里哭喊道：“啊！我亲爱的石竹花，这些伙伴这么糟糕，你们是怎么待下去的呀？”"
"Then she suddenly bethought herself of the pitcher of water, and, hoping that it might have some magic power, she ran to fetch it, and sprinkled a few drops over the fierce-looking swarm of rats.","然后，她忽然想起了那罐水，她一边跑去拿水，一边期盼着那罐水或许有些魔力，接着她朝那一大群凶神恶煞的老鼠洒了几滴水。"
"In a moment not a tail or a whisker was to be seen.","一瞬间，就连老鼠的尾巴和胡须都看不见了。"
"Each one had made for his hole as fast as his legs could carry him, so that the Princess could safely take her pot of pinks.","每只老鼠都竭尽全力尽快朝鼠洞逃去，这样公主就能安全地拿回她那罐石竹花了。"
"She found them nearly dying for want of water, and hastily poured all that was left in the pitcher upon them.","她发现那些花儿由于缺水都快枯死了，便赶快把水罐里面剩下的所有水都浇到了花上。"
"As she bent over them, enjoying their delicious scent, a soft voice, that seemed to rustle among the leaves, said:","正当她朝它们俯下身去，享受它们芬芳的花香时，一个似乎在花叶之间窸窣作响的柔软声音发话了："
"“Lovely Felicia, the day has come at last when I may have the happiness of telling you how even the flowers love you and rejoice in your beauty.”","“可爱的费利西娅，这一天终于来了，我终于可以愉快地告诉你即使是花朵都有多么爱你，多么为你的美丽而欣喜。”"
"The Princess, quite overcome by the strangeness of hearing a cabbage, a hen, and a pink speak, and by the terrible sight of an army of rats, suddenly became very pale, and fainted away.","公主听到一棵卷心菜，一只母鸡和一朵石竹花对她说话，又看到一大群老鼠，她被这些奇怪的事和可怕的景象吓到了，突然面如土色，昏了过去。"
"At this moment in came Bruno.","就在这时，布鲁诺进来了。"
"Working hard in the heat had not improved his temper, and when he saw that Felicia had succeeded in finding her pinks he was so angry that he dragged her out into the garden and shut the door upon her.","即使是在烈日下辛苦劳作也没能让他的脾气好一点儿，看到费利西娅成功找到了她的石竹花，他非常愤怒，把她拖到外面的花园，然后关上门不让她进来。"
"The fresh air soon made her open her pretty eyes, and there before her stood the Queen of the Woods, looking as charming as ever.","新鲜的空气很快使她睁开了美丽的双眸，森林女王就站在她面前，她看起来跟之前一样迷人。"
"“You have a bad brother,” she said; “I saw he turned you out.","“你哥哥很坏，”她说，“我看着他把你赶出来。"
"Shall I punish him for it?”","我能因为这件事惩罚他吗？”"
"“Ah! no, madam,” she said; “I am not angry with him.","“啊！不，夫人，”她说，“我不生他的气。"
"“But supposing he was not your brother, after all, what would you say then?” asked the Queen.","“可是假使他不是你的哥哥，那你会怎么说？”女王问道。"
"“Oh! but I think he must be,” said Felicia.","“哦！但我想他肯定是我哥哥。”费利西娅说。"
"“What!” said the Queen, “have you not heard that you are a Princess?”","“什么！”女王说，“难道你没听说你是一位公主吗？”"
"“I was told so a little while ago, madam, but how could I believe it without a single proof?”","“前不久，有人是这么告诉我的，夫人，但一点儿证据都没有，我怎么能相信呢？”"
"“Ah! dear child,” said the Queen, “the way you speak assures me that, in spite of your humble upbringing, you are indeed a real princess, and I can save you from being treated in such a way again.”","“啊！亲爱的孩子，”女王说道，“你说话的方式使我确信，尽管长于粗鄙之家，但你确实是一位真正的公主。我可以搭救你，让你不再受此待遇。”"
"She was interrupted at this moment by the arrival of a very handsome young man.","这时，一位英俊青年的到来打断了她。"
"He wore a coat of green velvet fastened with emerald clasps, and had a crown of pinks on his head.","他穿着一件绿色天鹅绒大衣，上面系着翡翠扣子，他的头上戴着石竹花做的王冠。"
"He knelt upon one knee and kissed the Queen’s hand.","他单腿跪地，亲吻着女王的手。"
"“Ah!” she cried, “my pink, my dear son, what a happiness to see you restored to your natural shape by Felicia’s aid!”","“啊！”她喊道，“我的石竹花，我亲爱的儿子，看到你在费利西娅的帮助下恢复了本来面目，我真是无比高兴啊！”"
"And she embraced him joyfully.","然后她非常开心地拥抱他。"
"Then, turning to Felicia, she said:","接着，她转向费利西娅，说道："
"“Charming Princess, I know all the hen told you, but you cannot have heard that the zephyrs, to whom was entrusted the task of carrying my son to the tower where the Queen, your mother, so anxiously waited for him, left him instead in a garden of flowers, while they flew off to tell your mother.","“美丽的公主，我知道那只母鸡告诉你的一切，但你肯定还没听说过：西风之神被托付了一项任务，他负责把我儿子带到王后，也就是你母亲那里去。她在塔里焦急地等着他，但西风之神却把他留在一个花园里，自己飞去告知你的母亲。"
"Whereupon a fairy with whom I had quarrelled changed him into a pink, and I could do nothing to prevent it.","于是，一个曾经与我有过争吵的仙女把他变成了一朵石竹花，而我却没办法阻止这件事发生。"
"“You can imagine how angry I was, and how I tried to find some means of undoing the mischief she had done; but there was no help for it.","“你能想象得出我有多愤怒，还有我做了多少努力，想找到方法解开她的咒语；但都于事无补。"
"I could only bring Prince Pink to the place where you were being brought up, hoping that when you grew up he might love you, and by your care be restored to his natural form.","我只能把石竹花王子带到你成长的地方，希望当你长大成人的时候，他会爱上你，并且在你的照料下，能变回原来的样子。"
"And you see everything has come right, as I hoped it would.","而你已经看到了，所有的一切都回归正轨，正如我希望的那样。"
"Your giving me the silver ring was the sign that the power of the charm was nearly over, and my enemy’s last chance was to frighten you with her army of rats.","你把银戒指给了我，这就代表着魔法的力量快要消失了，我敌人的最后一次机会就是用她那一大群老鼠吓唬你。"
"That she did not succeed in doing; so now, my dear Felicia, if you will be married to my son with this silver ring your future happiness is certain.","她没有成功；所以，现在，我亲爱的费利西娅，如果你愿意戴着这枚银戒指嫁给我儿子，你将来一定会非常幸福的。"
"Do you think him handsome and amiable enough to be willing to marry him?”","你觉得他够帅气，够和蔼，让你愿意嫁给他吗？”"
"“Madam,” replied Felicia, blushing, “you overwhelm me with your kindness.","“夫人，”费利西娅脸红了，回答道，“您的好意让我受宠若惊。"
"I know that you are my mother’s sister, and that by your art you turned the soldiers who were sent to kill me into cabbages, and my nurse into a hen, and that you do me only too much honor in proposing that I shall marry your son.","我知道您是我母亲的姐姐，您用自己的仙术把被派来杀我的士兵变成了卷心菜，把我的乳母变成了母鸡，您建议我嫁给您的儿子，也让我倍感荣幸。"
"How can I explain to you the cause of my hesitation?","我该怎么向您解释我犹豫的原因呢？"
"I feel, for the first time in my life, how happy it would make me to be beloved.","我这一生第一次感受到，被人深爱是有多么幸福。"
"Can you indeed give me the Prince’s heart?”","您真的能把王子的真心给我吗？”"
"“It is yours already, lovely Princess!” he cried, taking her hand in his; “but for the horrible enchantment which kept me silent I should have told you long ago how dearly I love you.”","“它已经是你的了，可爱的公主！”他握着她的手，大声说道，“要不是那个可怕的魔咒让我不能说话，我早就想告诉你，我有多爱你。”"
"This made the Princess very happy, and the Queen, who could not bear to see her dressed like a poor shepherdess, touched her with her wand, saying:","这使公主十分开心，女王不忍心再看到她穿得像个穷牧羊女一般，便用她的魔杖碰了她一下，嘴里说着："
"“I wish you to be attired as befits your rank and beauty.”","“愿你的衣着能与你的地位和美貌相称。”"
"And immediately the Princess’s cotton dress became a magnificent robe of silver brocade embroidered with carbuncles, and her soft dark hair was encircled by a crown of diamonds, from which floated a clear white veil.","公主的棉布裙立刻变为华丽的银线锦缎长袍，上面还装饰着红宝石，她柔软的黑发上戴着钻石王冠，王冠下面飘扬着一袭透明的白色面纱。"
"With her bright eyes, and the charming color in her cheeks, she was altogether such a dazzling sight that the Prince could hardly bear it.","她双眸明亮，面颊色彩迷人，整个人看上去如此太耀眼，王子几乎无法承受。"
"“How pretty you are, Felicia!” he cried.","“你真美啊，费利西娅！”他惊呼道，"
"“Don’t keep me in suspense, I entreat you; say that you will marry me.”","“我恳求你，不要让我的心悬着了；说你会嫁给我。”"
"“Ah!” said the Queen, smiling, “I think she will not refuse now.”","“啊！”女王微笑着说道，“我想她现在不会拒绝你的。”"
"Just then Bruno, who was going back to his work, came out of the cottage, and thought he must be dreaming when he saw Felicia; but she called him very kindly, and begged the Queen to take pity on him.","就在那时，布鲁诺正要回去工作，他从小屋里出来，看到费利西娅的时候，他觉得自己一定是在做梦；但她十分友好地叫了他，请求女王可怜可怜他。"
"“What!” she said, “when he was so unkind to you?”","“什么！”她说，“可他对你多么无情啊！”"
"“Ah! madam,” said the Princess, “I am so happy that I should like everybody else to be happy too.”","“啊！夫人，”公主说道，“我是如此幸福，以至于也希望所有其他人都能快快乐乐。”"
"The Queen kissed her, and said: “Well, to please you, let me see what I can do for this cross Bruno.”","女王亲吻了她，并说道：“好，为了使你高兴，我看看我能为这个乖戾的布鲁诺做点儿什么。”"
"And with a wave of her wand she turned the poor little cottage into a splendid palace, full of treasures; only the two stools and the straw bed remained just as they were, to remind him of his former poverty.","她把魔杖一挥，把破旧的小屋变成一座华丽的宫殿，里面满是金银财宝；只有那两条凳子和稻草床还放在原来的地方，为的是让他不要忘记之前的穷困。"
"Then the Queen touched Bruno himself, and made him gentle and polite and grateful, and he thanked her and the Princess a thousand times.","然后女王碰了碰布鲁诺，使他变得温和，礼貌而懂得感恩，他一遍又一遍地感谢着她和公主。"
"Lastly, the Queen restored the hen and the cabbages to their natural forms, and left them all very contented.","最后，女王把母鸡和卷心菜变回了原来的样子，让他们所有人都十分满意。"
"The Prince and Princess were married as soon as possible with great splendor, and lived happily ever after. ","王子和公主很快举办了一场盛大的婚礼，从此幸福地生活在一起。"
