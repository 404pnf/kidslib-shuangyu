"接受采访","An Encounter with an Interviewer "
"作者：马克·吐温","by Mark Twain"
"那个穿戴整齐、略显紧张的“快活”小伙子坐到了我给他的椅子上，说他和《每日雷暴》有关系，还补充说：","The nervous, dapper, “peart” young man took the chair I offered him, and said he was connected with the Daily Thunderstorm, and added: "
"“希望我这次来采访，没有给您带来不便。”","“Hoping it’s no harm, I’ve come to interview you.”"
"“来干嘛？”","“Come to what?”"
"“采访您。”","“Interview you.”"
"“啊！我明白了。好的——好的。嗯！好——好。”","“Ah! I see.Yes—yes.Um!Yes—yes.”"
"那天早上我感觉不甚愉快。确实，我的情绪有点低落。但我还是走到书柜那里，看了六七分钟后，我觉得最好还是招呼一下那个小伙子。我说：","I was not feeling bright that morning.Indeed, my powers seemed a bit under a cloud.However, I went to the bookcase, and when I had been looking six or seven minutes I found I was obliged to refer to the young man.I said:—"
"“你如何拼写那个单词？”","“How do you spell it?”"
"“拼什么？”","“Spell what?”"
"“采访（interview）。”","“Interview.”"
"“哦，天哪！您要我拼它干什么？”","“Oh, my goodness! what do you want to spell it for?”"
"“我不是想拼它，我想弄清楚它的意思。”","“I don’t want to spell it; I want to see what it means.”"
"“哦，我不得不说，这让我很吃惊。我可以告诉您它的意思，如果您——如果您——”","“Well, this is astonishing, I must say.I can tell you what it means, if you—if you—” "
"“哦，好吧！那也可以，我也十分感谢你。”","“Oh, all right!That will answer, and much obliged to you, too.”"
"“In, in, ter, ter, inter—” ","“In, in, ter, ter, inter—” "
"“这么说你拼的时候以‘I’开头了？”","“Then you spell it with an I?”"
"“天啊，当然了！”","“Why certainly!”"
"“哦，那就是困扰我很久的问题。”","“Oh, that is what took me so long.”"
"“那么，我敬爱的先生，您提议这个词以什么开头呢？”","“Why, my dear sir, what did you propose to spell it with?”"
"“嗯，我——我——真的不知道。我有一本未删节的字典，我翻到字典末页，希望能在插图中找到那个词。但字典的版本太旧了。”","“Well, I—I—hardly know.I had the Unabridged, and I was ciphering around in the back end, hoping I might tree her among the pictures.But it’s a very old edition.”"
"“哦，我的朋友，即使是在最新的版本里，他们也不会给这个词配上插图——我亲爱的先生，请原谅，我绝对没有冒犯的意思，但您确实看起来不像——不像——我期待得那样聪明。不是冒犯——我绝对没有冒犯的意思。”","“Why, my friend, they wouldn’t have a picture of it in even the latest e——My dear sir, I beg your pardon, I mean no harm in the world, but you do not look as—as—intelligent as I had expected you would.No harm—I mean no harm at all.”"
"“哦，没有关系！经常有人说，而且都是那些不会奉承、而且也没有缘由要奉承的人说，我在那方面确实很不一般。是的——是的，他们总是兴高采烈地这么说。”","“Oh, don’t mention it!It has often been said, and by people who would not flatter and who could have no inducement to flatter, that I am quite remarkable in that way.Yes—yes; they always speak of it with rapture.”"
"“这点，我很容易就能想到。但是关于这次采访，您知道时下流行的风气，就是采访任何一个臭名昭著的人。”","“I can easily imagine it.But about this interview.You know it is the custom, now, to interview any man who has become notorious.”"
"“真的，我以前还从没听说过。那一定很有趣。你是如何处理这样的采访的？”","“Indeed, I had not heard of it before.It must be very interesting.What do you do it with?”"
"“啊，嗯——嗯——嗯——这很让人泄气。在某些情况下得用棍棒才能完成；不过通常情况下，都是采访人提问，被采访者回答问题。这就是现在的潮流。您同意我问一些会把您公开的和私人的历史都公之于众的重要问题吗？”","“Ah, well—well—well—this is disheartening.It ought to be done with a club in some cases; but customarily it consists in the interviewer asking questions and the interviewed answering them.It is all the rage now.Will you let me ask you certain questions calculated to bring out the salient points of your public and private history?”"
"“哦，乐意之至——乐意之至。我记性不大好，希望你不要介意。我的意思是说，我的记性时好时坏——不一般地时好时坏。有时记性像快马奔驰，有时候需要长达两个星期的时间才能过一个特定的点。这对我来说真是件悲惨的事。”","“Oh, with pleasure—with pleasure.I have a very bad memory, but I hope you will not mind that.That is to say, it is an irregular memory—singularly irregular.Sometimes it goes in a gallop, and then again it will be as much as a fortnight passing a given point.This is a great grief to me.”"
"“哦，那没关系，您就尽您所能做到最好吧。”","“Oh, it is no matter, so you will try to do the best you can.”"
"“我会的。我会全心全意投入的。”","“I will.I will put my whole mind on it.”"
"“谢谢。准备好开始了吗？”","“Thanks.Are you ready to begin?”"
"“准备好了。”","“Ready.”"
"问：您贵庚？","Q.How old are you?"
"答：到六月就满十九岁。","A.Nineteen, in June."
"问：真的？我还以为您三十五六了。您的出生地？","Q.Indeed.I would have taken you to be thirty-five or six.Where were you born?"
"答：密苏里州。","A.In Missouri."
"问：您何时开始从事写作？","Q.When did you begin to write?"
"答：1836年。","A.In 1836."
"问：啊，这怎么可能，如果您现在只有十九岁？","Q.Why, how could that be, if you are only nineteen now?"
"答：我不知道。这听起来是有点很奇怪。","A.I don’t know.It does seem curious, somehow."
"问：很奇怪，真的。您认为谁是您遇到过的最不同凡响的人？","Q.It does, indeed.Whom do you consider the most remarkable man you ever met?"
"答：阿伦·伯尔。","A.Aaron Burr."
"问：但是，要是你只有十九岁，你绝不可能见过阿伦·伯尔！","Q.But you never could have met Aaron Burr, if you are only nineteen years!—"
"答：好吧，要是你比我还更了解我，你问我干什么？","A.Now, if you know more about me than I do, what do you ask me for?"
"问：哦，这只是个建议，没别的意思。您是怎么遇到伯尔的？","Q.Well, it was only a suggestion; nothing more.How did you happen to meet Burr?"
"答：哦，有天我碰巧出席他的葬礼，他让我别发出那么多噪音，然后——","A.Well, I happened to be at his funeral one day, and he asked me to make less noise, and—"
"问：但是，天哪！如果您参加了他的葬礼，他肯定是死了，要是他死了，他怎么会在意您有没有发出噪音呢？","Q.But, good heavens! if you were at his funeral, he must have been dead, and if he was dead how could he care whether you made a noise or not?"
"答：我不知道。在那方面，他总是个奇特的人。","A.I don’t know.He was always a particular kind of a man that way."
"问：但是，我还是完全不能理解。您说，他跟您说话，而且他已经死了。","Q.Still, I don’t understand it at all.You say he spoke to you, and that he was dead."
"答：我没说他死了。","A.I didn’t say he was dead."
"问：那么他没死？","Q.But wasn’t he dead?"
"答：哦，有些人说他死了，有些人说他没死。","A.Well, some said he was, some said he wasn’t."
"问：那您怎么认为？","Q.What did you think?"
"答：哦，那一点儿不关我的事！那又不是我的葬礼。","A.Oh, it was none of my business!It wasn’t any of my funeral."
"问：那您——算了，我们永远也弄不清这件事了。我问问其他的问题。您是哪一天出生的？","Q.Did you—However, we can never get this matter straight.Let me ask about something else.What was the date of your birth?"
"答：1693年10月31日，星期一。","A.Monday, October 31, 1693."
"问：什么！不可能！那样的话，您已经180岁了。您如何解释这点呢？","Q.What!Impossible!That would make you a hundred and eighty years old.How do you account for that?"
"答：我根本不用解释。","A.I don’t account for it at all."
"问：但您一开始说您只有19岁，而现在您又把自己说成个180岁的人。这真是非常矛盾。","Q.But you said at first you were only nineteen, and now you make yourself out to be one hundred and eighty.It is an awful discrepancy."
"答：啊，你注意到了？（握手。）我时常觉得这似乎矛盾，但不知为什么，我总不能确定。你的观察力多敏锐！","A.Why, have you noticed that?(Shaking hands.)Many a time it has seemed to me like a discrepancy, but somehow I couldn’t make up my mind.How quick you notice a thing!"
"问：承蒙夸奖，虽然我受之有愧。您有过，或者是您有兄弟姐妹吗？","Q.Thank you for the compliment, as far as it goes.Had you, or have you, any brothers or sisters?"
"答：啊！我——我——我想我有——是的——但我不记得了。","A.Eh!I—I—I think so—yes—but I don’t remember."
"问：啊，这是我听到过的最不同寻常的回答！","Q.Well, that is the most extraordinary statement I ever heard!"
"答：哦，你怎么会那么想？","A.Why, what makes you think that?"
"问：不然我能怎么想？啊，看这里！墙上照片里的人是谁？不是您的一个兄弟吗？","Q.How could I think otherwise?Why, look here!Who is this a picture of on the wall?Isn’t that a brother of yours?"
"答：哦，是，是，是！现在你提醒我了，那是我的一个兄弟。那是威廉——我们叫他比尔。可怜的老比尔！","A.Oh, yes, yes, yes!Now you remind me of it; that was a brother of mine.That’s William—Bill we called him.Poor old Bill!"
"问：为什么？那他去世了，是吗？","Q.Why?Is he dead, then?"
"答：啊！这个，我猜是的。我们从没弄明白。关于这件事，有个很大的谜。","A.Ah! well, I suppose so.We never could tell.There was a great mystery about it."
"问：那真是让人伤心，非常伤心。那么是他失踪了？","Q.That is sad, very sad.He disappeared, then?"
"答：啊，是，总的来说是这样。我们葬了他——","A.Well, yes, in a sort of general way.We buried him—"
"问：葬了他！葬了他，却不知道他是死是生？","Q.Buried him!Buried him, without knowing whether he was dead or not?"
"答：哦，不！不是那样。他确实死了。","A.Oh, no!Not that.He was dead enough."
"问：好吧，我承认我不能理解这件事。如果你们把他埋了，那么你们就是知道他死了。","Q.Well, I confess that I can’t understand this.If you buried him, and you knew he was dead."
"答：不！不！我们只是以为他死了。","A.No! no!We only thought he was."
"问：哦，我明白了！他死而复生了？","Q.Oh, I see!He came to life again?"
"答：我敢说他没有。","A.I bet he didn’t."
"问：哦，我从没听过这样的事。有人死了。有人被埋葬了。这样，哪来的谜？","Q.Well, I never heard anything like this.Somebody was dead.Somebody was buried.Now, where was the mystery?"
"答：啊！就是这点！就是这点没错。你看，我们是双胞胎——已故的那个和我——我们只有两个星期大的时候，我们在浴缸里被弄混了，其中一个被淹死了。但是我们不知道淹死的是哪个。有人认为是比尔。有人认为是我。","A.Ah! that’s just it!That’s it exactly.You see, we were twins—defunct and I—and we got mixed in the bathtub when we were only two weeks old, and one of us was drowned.But we didn’t know which.Some think it was Bill.Some think it was me."
"问：哦，那确实很不寻常。您怎么看？","Q.Well, that is remarkable.What do you think?"
"答：天知道！我愿意倾所有，来知道真相。这个重大、可怕的谜，在我的人生中投下了阴影。但是现在我要告诉你个秘密，一个我以前从未向任何人透露过的秘密。我们中的一个有个特殊标记——左手背上有一个很大的痣，而那个人就是我。那个孩子就是被淹死的那个！","A.Goodness knows!I would give whole worlds to know.This solemn, this awful mystery has cast a gloom over my whole life.But I will tell you a secret now, which I never have revealed to any creature before.One of us had a peculiar mark—a large mole on the back of his left hand; that was me.That child was the one that was drowned!"
"问：很好，不过，我没看出这件事有什么谜，一点儿也没看出。","Q.Very well, then, I don’t see that there is any mystery about it, after all."
"答：你没看出来？嗯，我看出来了。不管怎么说，我不明白，他们怎能犯下如此愚蠢的错误，竟然埋错了孩子。可是，嘘！千万别在我的家人能听到的时候说。天知道，不算这件事，让他们心碎的烦心事也已经够多了。","A.You don’t?Well, I do.Anyway, I don’t see how they could ever have been such a blundering lot as to go and bury the wrong child.But, ’sh!—don’t mention it where the family can hear of it.Heaven knows they have heartbreaking troubles enough without adding this."
"问：好吧，我相信我现在已经有足够的材料了，非常感激您为这事付出的努力。但是我仍对您关于阿伦·伯尔葬礼的叙述非常感兴趣。您是否介意告诉我，是什么特殊的情形，让您认为伯尔是位不同凡响的人物吗？","Q.Well, I believe I have got material enough for the present, and I am very much obliged to you for the pains you have taken.But I was a good deal interested in that account of Aaron Burr’s funeral.Would you mind telling me what particular circumstance it was that made you think Burr was such a remarkable man?"
"答：哦！就这区区小事！五十个人里都不会有一个人注意到这件事的。当布道结束后，送丧的队伍整装待发去往墓地，遗体也很好地安放在灵车内，他说他想最后看一眼这景色，所以他爬起来，和马车夫一起驱车去了。","A.Oh! it was a mere trifle!Not one man in fifty would have noticed it at all.When the sermon was over, and the procession all ready to start for the cemetery, and the body all arranged nice in the hearse, he said he wanted to take a last look at the scenery, and so he got up and rode with the driver."
"之后，那个小伙子就恭敬地离开了。他是个令人愉快的伙伴，看到他走，我很难过。","Then the young man reverently withdrew.He was very pleasant company, and I was sorry to see him go."
