"A Ghost Story","鬼故事"
"by Mark Twain","作者：马克·吐温 "
"I took a large room, far up Broadway, in a huge old building whose upper stories had been wholly unoccupied for years until I came.","我在远离百老汇的一处破旧的大楼里租了一间大屋。在我来之前，这栋房子上面的几层楼已经有很多年没有人住了。"
"The place had long been given up to dust and cobwebs, to solitude and silence.","这个地方已被废弃很久了，到处是灰尘和蜘蛛网，静寂又冷清。"
"I seemed groping among the tombs and invading the privacy of the dead, that first night I climbed up to my quarters.","第一天晚上，我爬上楼进入我的住所，我似乎是在坟墓丛中摸索着，侵犯着墓中人的隐私。"
"For the first time in my life a superstitious dread came over me; and as I turned a dark angle of the stairway and an invisible cobweb swung its lazy woof in my face and clung there, I shuddered as one who had encountered a phantom.","我经历了人生当中第一件光怪陆离且毛骨悚然的遭遇。当我在楼道的一个暗角处拐弯时，我的脸撞上一张看不见的蜘蛛网，它那邋遢的蛛丝晃到我的脸上并且黏在那里。我打了个冷战，像是碰到鬼了似的。"
"I was glad enough when I reached my room and locked out the mold and the darkness.","当我终于到了我的房间，将那些霉菌和黑暗都锁在门外时，我心里高兴极了。"
"A cheery fire was burning in the grate, and I sat down before it with a comforting sense of relief.","炉火烧得正旺；我在壁炉前面坐下，感到如释重负。"
"For two hours I sat there, thinking of bygone times; recalling old scenes, and summoning half-forgotten faces out of the mists of the past; listening, in fancy, to voices that long ago grew silent for all time, and to once familiar songs that nobody sings now.","我在那里坐了两个小时，回想着过去的时光，回忆着曾经的情景，回想着模糊的记忆中那些几乎被忘却的面容。遐想中，我仿佛听见了沉寂良久的声音，听见了那支曾经为人熟知、如今却无人再吟唱的歌曲。"
"And as my reverie softened down to a sadder and sadder pathos, the shrieking of the winds outside softened to a wail, the angry beating of the rain against the panes diminished to a tranquil patter, and one by one the noises in the street subsided, until the hurrying footsteps of the last belated straggler died away in the distance and left no sound behind.","我的冥想变成了一股淡淡的哀愁，窗外风的呼啸变成了哀鸣，玻璃上雨点的猛击也变成了轻敲。街上的嘈杂声陆续消失了，随着最后一个晚归的游荡者急促的脚步声渐行渐远，街上就没有什么声音了。"
"The fire had burned low.","炉子里的火也快要熄了。"
"A sense of loneliness crept over me.","一阵孤独感悄悄涌上我的心头。"
"I arose and undressed, moving on tiptoe about the room, doing stealthily what I had to do, as if I were environed by sleeping enemies whose slumbers it would be fatal to break.","我站起身来脱衣服，蹑手蹑脚地在房间里走动，轻手轻脚地做我要做的事，仿佛我身边都是睡着的敌人，吵醒他们就会很危险。"
"I covered up in bed, and lay listening to the rain and wind and the faint creaking of distant shutters, till they lulled me to sleep.","我在床上盖好被子，躺着听窗外的风声、雨声以及远处百叶窗微弱的嘎吱声，直到它们将我带入梦乡。"
"I slept profoundly, but how long I do not know.","我睡得很熟，但不知道睡了多久。"
"All at once I found myself awake, and filled with a shuddering expectancy.","我突然发现我醒了，而且内心充斥着某种令人害怕的预感。"
"All was still.","一切都很安静。"
"All but my own heart—I could hear it beat.","一切都很安静，除了我的心——我能听到它跳动的声音。"
"Presently the bedclothes began to slip away slowly toward the foot of the bed, as if some one were pulling them!","与此同时，我身上的铺盖开始滑向床尾，像是有人在那边拉扯它们一样！"
"I could not stir; I could not speak.","我不敢动弹，也不敢说话。"
"Still the blankets slipped deliberately away, till my breast was uncovered.","毯子依旧在不慌不忙地滑落，直到我的胸膛裸露在外面。"
"Then with a great effort I seized them and drew them over my head.","然后我使足劲将毯子拉回来，用毯子将我的脑袋蒙住。"
"I waited, listened, waited.","我等待着，倾听着，等待着。"
"Once more that steady pull began, and once more I lay torpid a century of dragging seconds till my breast was naked again.","那股有力的拉拽又开始了，我再一次无力地躺着，不知过了多久，我的胸膛再次裸露出来了。"
"At last I roused my energies and snatched the covers back to their place and held them with a strong grip.","最后，我鼓足了劲将被子扯回原位，并且死死地拽着它。"
"I waited.","我等待着。"
"By and by I felt a faint tug, and took a fresh grip.","没多久，我就感到一股轻微的拖拽，我立刻抓住被子。"
"The tug strengthened to a steady strain—it grew stronger and stronger.","那股拖拽的力量变成了更有力的拉扯——它的力量越来越强。"
"My hold parted, and for the third time the blankets slid away.","我手松了一下，毯子第三次滑落了。"
"I groaned.","我失声呻吟。"
"An answering groan came from the foot of the bed!","一声回应般的呻吟从床尾传来！"
"Beaded drops of sweat stood upon my forehead.","豆大的汗珠从我额头上冒出来。"
"I was more dead than alive.","我简直快被吓死了。"
"Presently I heard a heavy footstep in my room—the step of an elephant, it seemed to me—it was not like anything human.","不久，我听到房间里一阵沉重的脚步声——在我听来，像是大象的脚步声——那绝不是人类的脚步声。"
"But it was moving from me—there was relief in that.","但是那脚步声正在离我而去——这倒让我松了口气。"
"I heard it approach the door—pass out without moving bolt or lock—and wander away among the dismal corridors, straining the floors and joists till they creaked again as it passed—and then silence reigned once more.","我听到脚步声向门口靠近——然后走出房间，没有解门闩，也没有开锁——接着沿着阴森的走廊走下去，弄得地板与托梁嘎吱响——房间又回归了寂静。"
"When my excitement had calmed, I said to myself, “This is a dream—simply a hideous dream.”","当我紧张的心情平静下来的时候，我安慰自己说：“这是一场梦——只是一场可怕的梦。”"
"And so I lay thinking it over until I convinced myself that it was a dream, and then a comforting laugh relaxed my lips and I was happy again.","于是我躺在床上反复回想整件事，直到我说服自己那就是一场梦。一丝宽慰的笑意爬上了我的嘴唇，我又开心起来了。"
"I got up and struck a light; and when I found that the locks and bolts were just as I had left them, another soothing laugh welled in my heart and rippled from my lips.","我起床点燃了灯，发现门闩和门锁还是我锁门时候的样子，又一丝放松的笑意从我心里荡漾开来，爬上了我的嘴角。"
"I took my pipe and lit it, and was just sitting down before the fire, when—down went the pipe out of my nerveless fingers, the blood forsook my cheeks, and my placid breathing was cut short with a gasp!","我拿过烟管并点燃了它。我刚在炉火前面坐下，手中的烟管就从我无力的手指间掉了下去，我又吓得脸色惨白，平稳的呼吸再次变得急促起来！"
"In the ashes on the hearth, side by side with my own bare footprint, was another, so vast that in comparison mine was but an infant’s!","在炉边的灰烬上面，与我的赤足脚印并排着的还有另一行脚印，和这个大脚印相比，我的脚就像是婴儿的脚！"
"Then I had had a visitor, and the elephant tread was explained.","如此看来，我的房间里确实来了访客，这也解释了那个大象般的脚步声。"
"I put out the light and returned to bed, palsied with fear.","我熄灭了灯，回到床上，吓得不敢动弹。"
"I lay a long time, peering into the darkness, and listening.—Then I heard a grating noise overhead, like the dragging of a heavy body across the floor; then the throwing down of the body, and the shaking of my windows in response to the concussion.","我躺了好长时间，凝视着黑暗，静静聆听着——不久，我听到我头顶上方传来一阵恐怖的声音，就像是有人将一具很沉重的尸体拖过地板；然后，尸体被抛下来，那落地的撞击声使得我房间的窗户都跟着颤动了。"
"In distant parts of the building I heard the muffled slamming of doors.","从这栋楼里远点儿的地方传来了沉闷的摔门声。"
"I heard, at intervals, stealthy footsteps creeping in and out among the corridors, and up and down the stairs.","断断续续地，我还听到鬼鬼祟祟的脚步声在走廊里进进出出，在楼梯间上上下下。"
"Sometimes these noises approached my door, hesitated, and went away again.","有时这些嘈杂声会接近我的房门，犹豫一会儿，又走开了。"
"I heard the clanking of chains faintly, in remote passages, and listened while the clanking grew nearer—while it wearily climbed the stairways, marking each move by the loose surplus of chain that fell with an accented rattle upon each succeeding step as the goblin that bore it advanced.","我听到微弱的叮当声，声音是从远处的走廊里传来的，我仔细听着，那叮当声变得越来越近了——像是有人在艰难地爬楼梯，每走一步，那戴在脚上的脚镣松散的部分就与地面碰撞出嘎吱声——标志着它的前进。"
"I heard muttered sentences; half-uttered screams that seemed smothered violently; and the swish of invisible garments, the rush of invisible wings.","我听到嘀嘀咕咕的说话声、被人强行捂住嘴没发出来的尖叫声，还有看不见的衣服的窸窣声以及看不见的翅膀的扇动声。"
"Then I became conscious that my chamber was invaded—that I was not alone.","那时我意识到我的卧室被入侵了——我不是独自一个人。"
"I heard sighs and breathings about my bed, and mysterious whisperings.","我听到床边的叹息声、呼吸声，还有诡秘的私语声。"
"Three little spheres of soft phosphorescent light appeared on the ceiling directly over my head, clung and glowed there a moment, and then dropped—two of them upon my face and one upon the pillow.","三个发着微弱磷光的小圆点出现在我头顶正上方的天花板上，它们在那里停留了一会儿，接着掉了下来——两个掉在我的脸上，一个掉在我的枕头上。"
"They, spattered, liquidly, and felt warm.","它们是液体状的，落地时飞溅开来，并且热乎乎的。"
"Intuition told me they had—turned to gouts of blood as they fell—I needed no light to satisfy myself of that.","直觉告诉我——在落地的瞬间它们就变成了血滴——即使没有光线我也很确定这一点。"
"Then I saw pallid faces, dimly luminous, and white uplifted hands, floating bodiless in the air—floating a moment and then disappearing.","随后我看到了惨白的脸在若隐若现，还有白色的手高举着，却没有形体，浮在空中——它们漂浮了一会儿，然后又消失不见了。"
"The whispering ceased, and the voices and the sounds, and a solemn stillness followed.","耳语声变小了，其他的声音、声响也变微弱了，又恢复了肃穆的寂静。"
"I waited and listened.","我等待着，聆听着。"
"I felt that I must have light or die.","我觉得我必须有光，否则我就会死。"
"I was weak with fear.","恐惧让我虚脱了。"
"I slowly raised myself toward a sitting posture, and my face came in contact with a clammy hand!","我慢慢地起身，努力使自己坐起来；这时，我的脸却碰到了一只湿冷的手！"
"All strength went from me apparently, and I fell back like a stricken invalid.","我明显感觉到全身的力气都没了，我像个病人般倒回床上。"
"Then I heard the rustle of a garment it seemed to pass to the door and go out.","接着我听到衣服的沙沙声，像是经过房门并走出去了。"
"When everything was still once more, I crept out of bed, sick and feeble, and lit the gas with a hand that trembled as if it were aged with a hundred years.","当一切再次恢复平静的时候，我从床上爬起来，疲惫又虚弱。接着，我用百岁老人般颤抖的手点燃了煤气灯。"
"The light brought some little cheer to my spirits.","光亮让我的精神稍微振奋了一点儿。"
"I sat down and fell into a dreamy contemplation of that great footprint in the ashes.","我坐下来，又陷入了对灰烬中那大脚印的冥想中。"
"By and by its outlines began to waver and grow dim.","不久，它的轮廓开始颤抖，变得模糊不清。"
"I glanced up and the broad gas-flame was slowly wilting away.","我向上瞥了一眼，煤气灯旺盛的火苗开始变得微弱起来。"
"In the same moment I heard that elephantine tread again.","与此同时，我又听到了那大象般的脚步声。"
"I noted its approach, nearer and nearer, along the musty halls, and dimmer and dimmer the light waned.","我注意到它在靠近，越来越近，就沿着发着霉臭味的过道走来；与此同时，灯光也变得越来越暗了。"
"The tread reached my very door and paused—the light had dwindled to a sickly blue, and all things about me lay in a spectral twilight.","那脚步声到了我的门口，就停在门外——灯光已缩小到成一种暗淡的蓝光，我周围的一切都被笼罩在诡秘的微光中。"
"The door did not open, and yet I felt a faint gust of air fan my cheek, and presently was conscious of a huge, cloudy presence before me.","门没有开，可是我却感受到一阵微弱的气息拂过我的脸颊，呈现在我面前的是一团巨大的朦胧的东西。"
"I watched it with fascinated eyes.","我像是受了蛊惑一样看着它。"
"A pale glow stole over the Thing; gradually its cloudy folds took shape—an arm appeared, then legs, then a body, and last a great sad face looked out of the vapor.","一道苍白的光悄悄笼罩着那个怪物身上；渐渐地，它那模糊的一团开始成形——先是一条胳膊，接着是腿，然后是身体，最后是一张忧伤的脸从那团烟雾之中望向外面。"
"Stripped of its filmy housings, naked, muscular and comely, the majestic Cardiff Giant loomed above me!","它脱去了那层薄薄的遮掩物，赤裸着身体，健壮又帅气，这个威武的加的夫巨人就赫然出现在我的上方！"
"All my misery vanished—for a child might know that no harm could come with that benignant countenance.","我所有的恐惧都消失了——因为就连孩子都知道，有着如此亲切面容的人是不会伤害人的。"
"My cheerful spirits returned at once, and in sympathy with them the gas flamed up brightly again.","我的愉快精神立刻恢复了，连那煤气灯都似乎回应一般地又亮了起来。"
"Never a lonely outcast was so glad to welcome company as I was to greet the friendly giant.","没有一个流浪汉会像我欢迎这个友好的巨人这样高兴地欢迎他的同伴。"
"I said:","我问道："
"“Why, is it nobody but you?","“嗨，除了你没有别人吗？"
"Do you know, I have been scared to death for the last two or three hours?","你知道吗，在刚过去的两三个小时里，我简直吓得要死！"
"I am most honestly glad to see you.","看到你我真高兴！"
"I wish I had a chair—Here, here, don’t try to sit down in that thing—”","我希望我有把椅子——这儿，这儿，别去坐那儿——”"
"But it was too late.","可是已经来不及了。"
"He was in it before I could stop him and down he went—I never saw a chair shivered so in my life.","我还没来得及阻止他，他就已经坐下去了，随后他就坐到地上去了——我从来没有看到一张椅子破碎成那样。"
"“Stop, stop, you’ll ruin ev—”","“停下，快停下，你会毁了一切——”"
"Too late again.","又迟了。"
"There was another crash, and another chair was resolved into its original elements.","又是一阵破碎声，另外一张椅子被肢解成了它最初的组成部分。"
"“Confound it, haven’t you got any judgment at’ all?","“该死的，你就没有一点儿判断能力吗？"
"Do you want to ruin all the furniture on the place?","你想毁掉这里所有的家具吗？"
"Here, here, you petrified fool—”","这里，这里，你这个呆笨的傻瓜——”"
"But it was no use.","可是这也没有用。"
"Before I could arrest him he had sat down on the bed, and it was a melancholy ruin.","在我还没抓住他之前，他就坐到床上了，床被令人伤感地破坏了。"
"“Now what sort of a way is that to do?","“现在，你究竟想要干什么？”"
"First you come lumbering about the place bringing a legion of vagabond goblins along with you to worry me to death, and then when I overlook an indelicacy of costume which would not be tolerated anywhere by cultivated people except in a respectable theater, and not even there if the nudity were of your sex, you repay me by wrecking all the furniture you can find to sit down on.","你一来就给这个地方添乱，带来一大群无赖鬼怪，把我吓得要死，之后我又容忍你衣着的不得体——除了有名的大戏院之外，任何有教养的人都没有办法容忍这一点，即使对方是你的同性。而你回报我的却是在所有你能找到的家具上面坐下去，毁坏它们。"
"And why will you?","你想干什么？"
"You damage yourself as much as you do me.","你在毁坏我的东西的同时也在大大地毁坏你自己。"
"You have broken off the end of your spinal column, and littered up the floor with chips of your hams till the place looks like a marble yard.","你折断了你的尾骨；你的腿臀撞在地板上时地板碎了一地，直到这个地方看上去像个大理石场。"
"You ought to be ashamed of yourself—you are big enough to know better.”","你应该为自己感到羞耻——你够大的了，应该懂得更多的事情。”"
"“Well, I will not break any more furniture.","“好吧，我再也不会毁坏任何家具了。"
"But what am I to do?","可是我能怎么办呢？"
"I have not had a chance to sit down for a century.”","我已经有一个世纪没有机会坐下了。”"
"And the tears came into his eyes.","泪水涌上了他的眼眶。"
"“Poor devil,” I said, “I should not have been so harsh with you.","“可怜的小妖精，”我叹息道，“我不应该对你那么凶的。"
"And you are an orphan, too, no doubt.","毫无疑问，你也是个孤儿。"
"But sit down on the floor here—nothing else can stand your weight—and besides, we cannot be sociable with you away up there above me; I want you down where I can perch on this high counting-house stool and gossip with you face to face.”","那你就坐在地板上吧——除此之外没有其他的东西能承受你的重量——另外，你在那么高的地方我没法跟你交流，我希望你能坐下来，这样我就能在那个高高的账房椅子上坐着跟你面对面交谈。”"
"So he sat down on the floor, and lit a pipe which I gave him, threw one of my red blankets over his shoulders, inverted my sitz-bath on his head, helmet fashion, and made himself picturesque and comfortable.","这样他就坐在地板上，点燃我给他的一支烟管；我把一条红色的毯子丢给他，让他围在肩膀上，把我的浴盆反扣在他头上当头盔用，让他看起来又别致，有舒服。"
"Then he crossed his ankles, while I renewed the fire, and exposed the flat, honeycombed bottoms of his prodigious feet to the grateful warmth.","随后他将腿盘起来，我又重新点亮了火，以便给他那两只平坦的蜂窝状的大脚底板取暖。"
"“What is the matter with the bottom of your feet and the back of your legs, that they are gouged up so?”","“你的脚底板和腿的背部是怎么回事，怎么坑坑洼洼的啊？”"
"“Infernal chilblains—I caught them clear up to the back of my head, roosting out there under Newell’s farm.","“是可恶的冻疮——从脚上一直到头顶后面都有，是在纽厄尔农场上感染的。"
"But I love the place; I love it as one loves his old home.","可我又喜爱那个地方——我爱那个地方，像一个人爱他的老家一样。"
"There is no peace for me like the peace I feel when I am there.”","对我来说，我在那里觉得再宁静不过了。”"
"We talked along for half an hour, and then I noticed that he looked tired, and spoke of it.","我们一起聊了半个小时，我发现他看上去有点儿累，便问他是不是。"
"“Tired?” he said.","“累？”他反问道，"
"“Well, I should think so.","“嗯，我想应该是的。"
"And now I will tell you all about it, since you have treated me so well.","现在我将告诉你关于我的一切，看在你对我这么好的份上。"
"I am the spirit of the Petrified Man that lies across the street there in the museum.","我是躺在街对面博物馆里的那个化石人的灵魂。"
"I am the ghost of the Cardiff Giant.","我是加的夫巨人的灵魂。"
"I can have no rest, no peace, till they have given that poor body burial again.","我不能休息，不得安宁，除非人们再次将那具可怜的尸体埋起来。"
"Now what was the most natural thing for me to do, to make men satisfy this wish?","为了让人们满足我这个愿望，我要做的最自然的事是什么？"
"Terrify them into it! haunt the place where the body lay!","那就是吓得他们去那样做！去存放尸体的地方闹鬼！"
"So I haunted the museum night after night.","因此我一晚接一晚地去那个博物馆。"
"I even got other spirits to help me.","我甚至找来其他的鬼魂帮我。"
"But it did no good, for nobody ever came to the museum at midnight.","然而那样做一点儿作用也没有，因为没有人半夜去参观博物馆。"
"Then it occurred to me to come over the way and haunt this place a little.","于是我就想顺路到这里闹个鬼。"
"I felt that if I ever got a hearing I must succeed, for I had the most efficient company that perdition could furnish.","我觉得如果我能引起人的注意，我必定能成功，因为我有一群可以毁灭一切的最得力的伙伴。"
"Night after night we have shivered around through these mildewed halls, dragging chains, groaning, whispering, tramping up and down stairs, till, to tell you the truth, I am almost worn out.","夜复一夜，我们在这些发霉的大厅里游荡，拖着脚镣，呻吟着，私语着，在楼梯间走上走下，直到——实话告诉你——直到我累得疲惫不堪为止。"
"But when I saw a light in your room to-night I roused my energies again and went at it with a deal of the old freshness.","但是我今晚看到你房间里有亮光，我又重新提起精神，凭借仅剩的一点儿精力走到这里来闹。"
"But I am tired out—entirely fagged out.","但是我真的很累了——精疲力竭了。"
"Give me, I beseech you, give me some hope!”","给我，我祈求你，给我一点儿希望吧！”"
"I lit off my perch in a burst of excitement, and exclaimed:","我激动地从我的凳子上跳下来，惊声说道："
"“This transcends everything! everything that ever did occur!","“这真是荒诞至极！前所未有！"
"Why you poor blundering old fossil, you have had all your trouble for nothing—you have been haunting a plaster cast of yourself—the real Cardiff Giant is in Albany!—","你这可怜、愚蠢的老顽固，你真是在白白自寻麻烦——你常常去的那个地方摆着的是你自己躯体的石膏模型——真正的加的夫巨人的躯体在奥尔巴尼！——"
"[A fact. The original fraud was ingeniously and fraudfully duplicated, and exhibited in New York as the “only genuine” Cardiff Giant (to the unspeakable disgust of the owners of the real colossus) at the very same time that the latter was drawing crowds at a museum is Albany,]—Confound it, don’t you know your own remains?”","【事实是，加的夫巨人化石的发现是个骗局，那是个处心积虑炮制的复制品，并且作为“唯一真正的”加的夫巨人在纽约展览过（此举令真正的巨人化石的拥有者感到极为痛恨），与此同时，真正的加的夫巨人化石却在奥尔巴尼博物馆吸引着大量的参观群众。】——该死！难道你认不出自己的化石遗体吗？”"
"I never saw such an eloquent look of shame, of pitiable humiliation, overspread a countenance before.","我以前从来没看到过如此难堪的表情，他脸上是一种带着些许谦卑的羞愧表情。"
"The Petrified Man rose slowly to his feet, and said:","那个化石人慢慢站起来，问道："
"“Honestly, is that true?”","“老实说，那是真的吗？”"
"“As true as I am sitting here.”","“绝对真实，跟你看到我现在坐在这里一样真实。”"
"He took the pipe from his mouth and laid it on the mantel, then stood irresolute a moment (unconsciously, from old habit, thrusting his hands where his pantaloons pockets should have been, and meditatively dropping his chin on his breast); and finally said:","他把烟管从他的嘴里拿下来放在壁炉上，然后犹犹豫豫地站了一会儿（他下意识地按老习惯把手放在紧身裤口袋的位置，边想边用下巴抵着胸口）。最后，他说道："
"“Well—I never felt so absurd before.","“嗯——我以前从没想到事情会如此荒唐。"
"The Petrified Man has sold everybody else, and now the mean fraud has ended by selling its own ghost!","这个化石人曾欺骗了其他的所有人，现在这个骗局要以欺骗他自己的灵魂而结束了！"
"My son, if there is any charity left in your heart for a poor friendless phantom like me, don’t let this get out.","我的孩子，如果你对像我这样无依无靠的可怜鬼魂还有点儿同情心的话，就不要把这件事说出去。"
"Think how you would feel if you had made such an ass of yourself.”","想想看，如果你自己也做了同样荒谬的事，你会作何感想。”"
"I heard his stately tramp die away, step by step down the stairs and out into the deserted street, and felt sorry that he was gone, poor fellow—and sorrier still that he had carried off my red blanket and my bath-tub.","我听到他沉重的脚步声渐行渐远，一步步走下楼梯，走向无人的街道。他走了，我心里很难过，可怜的家伙——使我更难过的是，他带走了我的红毯子和我的浴盆。"
