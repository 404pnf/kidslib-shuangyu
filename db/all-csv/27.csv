"第一章","Chapter 1"
"“我们又上升了吗？”“没有。恰恰相反。”“我们在下降吗？”“比那还要糟糕，上尉！我们正往下掉！”“天哪，赶紧扔掉压舱物！”“瞧！最后的一袋都空了！”“气球上升了吗？”“没有！”“我好像听到了海浪的冲击声。吊篮下面是大海！离我们不超过500英尺！”“快扔掉所有占重量的东西！……所有的！”","“Are we rising again?”“No.On the contrary.”“Are we descending?”“Worse than that, captain! we are falling!”“For Heaven’s sake heave out the ballast!”“There! the last sack is empty!”“Does the balloon rise?”“No!”“I hear a noise like the dashing of waves.The sea is below the car!It cannot be more than 500 feet from us!”“Overboard with every weight!...everything!”"
"这就是1865年3月23日下午四点钟回荡在辽阔、荒凉的太平洋上空的响亮、惊人的喊叫声。","Such were the loud and startling words which resounded through the air, above the vast watery desert of the Pacific, about four o’clock in the evening of the 23rd of March, 1865."
"那年春分前后，从东北方向吹来的骇人暴风令人难忘。从3月18日到26日，风暴肆虐，片刻不停。它给美洲、欧洲和亚洲造成了严重灾害，从北纬35度斜穿赤道到南纬40度，掠过了1800英里的地带。城市被摧毁，树木被连根拔起，堤岸被汹涌而来、排山倒海的巨浪冲毁。根据已经发布的数字，被抛上陆地的船只数以百计；水龙卷经过的地方，整个地区被夷为平地，一切都被摧毁了；好几千人被压死在陆地上，或是溺死在大海中。这就是那场毁灭性的风暴疯狂肆虐后留下的痕迹。1810年10月25日哈瓦那和1825年7月26日瓜达卢普的灾情固然可怕，可这一次却是有过之而无不及。","Few can possibly have forgotten the terrible storm from the northeast, in the middle of the equinox of that year.The tempest raged without intermission from the 18th to the 26th of March.Its ravages were terrible in America, Europe, and Asia, covering a distance of eighteen hundred miles, and extending obliquely to the equator from the thirty-fifth north parallel to the fortieth south parallel.Towns were overthrown, forests uprooted, coasts devastated by the mountains of water which were precipitated on them, vessels cast on the shore, which the published accounts numbered by hundreds, whole districts leveled by waterspouts which destroyed everything they passed over, several thousand people crushed on land or drowned at sea; such were the traces of its fury, left by this devastating tempest.It surpassed in disasters those which so frightfully ravaged Havana and Guadalupe, one on the 25th of October, 1810, the other on the 26th of July, 1825."
"就在陆地和海洋惨遭浩劫之时，激荡的高空也上演着同样惊心动魄的戏剧。","But while so many catastrophes were taking place on land and at sea, a drama not less exciting was being enacted in the agitated air."
"事实上，一只气球像被带入水柱顶端的皮球一样，卷入了一股气流的漩涡中，以每小时90英里的速度掠过天空，仿佛被空中漩涡紧抓住，转个不停。","In fact, a balloon, as a ball might be carried on the summit of a waterspout, had been taken into the circling movement of a column of air and had traversed space at the rate of ninety miles an hour, turning round and round as if seized by some aerial maelstrom."
"气球下面摆着一只吊舱，里面有五个人，由于浓雾中混着海洋表面悬浮的水花，人们几乎看不清楚他们。","Beneath the lower point of the balloon swung a car, containing five passengers, scarcely visible in the midst of the thick vapor mingled with spray which hung over the surface of the ocean."
"也许有人会问，这个被暴风捉弄的玩具从哪里来的？它又是从世界的哪个角落升起的？当然，它是不可能在风暴肆虐时飞起的。但是，暴风已经肆虐了五天，并且18日那天就已经有了要起风暴的征兆。毫无疑问，气球是从很远的地方飞来的，因为气球一昼夜的飞行不会少于2000英里。","Whence, it may be asked, had come that plaything of the tempest?From what part of the world did it rise?It surely could not have started during the storm.But the storm had raged five days already, and the first symptoms were manifested on the 18th.It cannot be doubted that the balloon came from a great distance, for it could not have traveled less than two thousand miles in twenty-four hours."
"这些乘客没有作为向导的标记，无论如何也没法计算自启程以来他们走过了多少路线。不同寻常的是，尽管狂风肆虐，他们还是安然无恙。他们被暴风抛来抛去，转来转去，却丝毫没有感觉到旋转，也没感觉到颠簸。","At any rate the passengers, destitute of all marks for their guidance, could not have possessed the means of reckoning the route traversed since their departure.It was a remarkable fact that, although in the very midst of the furious tempest, they did not suffer from it.They were thrown about and whirled round and round without feeling the rotation in the slightest degree, or being sensible that they were removed from a horizontal position."
"他们的视线没法穿透吊篮下面弥漫的浓雾。浓厚的水汽包围着他们。阴云密布，他们无法辨别是白天还是黑夜。此时他们悬浮在高空，既看不见地面的反光，也听不到人类居住地传来的声音，就连海洋的怒吼声也听不见，周围一片昏暗。只有当他们急剧下降时才意识到自己身处波涛汹涌的险境中。然而，当弹药、枪支和食物等重物被扔掉后，气球承载的重量变轻，升得更高了，悬浮在4500英尺的高空。航行的人们发现气球下面是伸展开的大海，觉得上面的危险较之下面没那么可怕，甚至毫不犹豫地扔掉了他们最有用的东西。与此同时，他们尽量不让气体漏掉一点，这可是他们冒险计划的命根子，它能让他们继续悬浮在无底深渊的上空。","Their eyes could not pierce through the thick mist which had gathered beneath the car.Dark vapor was all around them.Such was the density of the atmosphere that they could not be certain whether it was day or night.No reflection of light, no sound from inhabited land, no roaring of the ocean could have reached them, through the obscurity, while suspended in those elevated zones.Their rapid descent alone had informed them of the dangers which they ran from the waves.However, the balloon, lightened of heavy articles, such as ammunition, arms, and provisions, had risen into the higher layers of the atmosphere, to a height of 4,500 feet.The voyagers, after having discovered that the sea extended beneath them, and thinking the dangers above less dreadful than those below, did not hesitate to throw overboard even their most useful articles, while they endeavored to lose no more of that fluid, the life of their enterprise, which sustained them above the abyss."
"他们战战兢兢地度过了黑夜，如果是胆小的人，也许早就吓死了。白昼再次来临，风暴也随之渐渐缓和下来。从3月24日清晨起，暴风有了减弱的迹象。拂晓时分，朵朵轻云升上高空。几小时过去后，飓风变为清风，也就是说，大气层流动的速度减弱了一半。这时的风虽说还是水手们所说的“紧帆风”，但是恶劣天气的狂暴之势毕竟减弱不少了。","The night passed in the midst of alarms which would have been death to less energetic souls.Again the day appeared and with it the tempest began to moderate.From the beginning of that day, the 24th of March, it showed symptoms of abating.At dawn, some of the lighter clouds had risen into the more lofty regions of the air.In a few hours the wind had changed from a hurricane to a fresh breeze, that is to say, the rate of the transit of the atmospheric layers was diminished by half.It was still what sailors call “a close-reefed topsail breeze,” but the commotion in the elements had none the less considerably diminished."
"快到十一点钟时，低空明显晴朗了。大气散发出阴冷的潮气，雷雨过后总是如此。暴风似乎不再向西吹了。它好像已经筋疲力尽。它会不会像电流一样，顷刻间消失殆尽，就像有时候印度洋上的台风那样？","Towards eleven o’clock, the lower region of the air was sensibly clearer.The atmosphere threw off that chilly dampness which is felt after the passage of a great meteor.The storm did not seem to have gone farther to the west.It appeared to have exhausted itself.Could it have passed away in electric sheets, as is sometimes the case with regard to the typhoons of the Indian Ocean?"
"然而就在此时，气球很明显地再次慢慢匀速下降。看来它似乎正在一点一点瘪下去，气囊愈伸愈长，从球形变为椭圆形。将近正午，气球在距海面仅2000英尺的上空盘旋。气囊能容纳50000立方英尺气体，正因如此，气球才得以长时间悬浮在空中，尽管它理应向上升得很高，或者可能被抛向水平位置。","But at the same time, it was also evident that the balloon was again slowly descending with a regular movement.It appeared as if it were, little by little, collapsing, and that its case was lengthening and extending, passing from a spherical to an oval form.Towards midday the balloon was hovering above the sea at a height of only 2,000 feet.It contained 50,000 cubic feet of gas, and, thanks to its capacity, it could maintain itself a long time in the air, although it should reach a great altitude or might be thrown into a horizontal position."
"乘客们意识到自己面临的危险，扔掉了最后几件压低吊舱的物品，包括保存的少量存粮，也扔掉了所有东西，甚至是随身携带的小刀。有一个人爬到套着网索的圆环上，试图把气球的下部系得更牢靠些。","Perceiving their danger, the passengers cast away the last articles which still weighed down the car, the few provisions they had kept, everything, even to their pocket-knives, and one of them, having hoisted himself on to the circles which united the cords of the net, tried to secure more firmly the lower point of the balloon."
"然而，这些旅行者们都很清楚，气体越来越少，气球不可能再悬浮在更高的地方。他们必然死路一条!","It was, however, evident to the voyagers that the gas was failing, and that the balloon could no longer be sustained in the higher regions.They must infallibly perish!"
"气球下面看不见大陆，甚至连个小岛也看不见。这片辽阔的水域没有一丁点陆地，也没有一处坚实的地面可供他们抛锚。","There was not a continent, nor even an island, visible beneath them.The watery expanse did not present a single speck of land, not a solid surface upon which their anchor could hold."
"就在这辽阔的海面上，惊涛骇浪咆哮不止！即使人们在高处俯瞰，视野扩大至方圆40英里，海洋仍是一望无际。这流动的广阔平原被暴风毫不留情地鞭挞，洋面犹如一群群狂怒的战马，它们凌乱的白色鬃毛在风中飘动。看不到陆地，也看不到一艘船！必须不惜一切代价阻止气球继续下落，避免卷入波浪。旅行者们把全力全身力气用在这个紧急任务上。但是，无论他们如何努力，气球仍在下落，同时以极快的速度顺着风向移动，也就是说从东北向西南方向移动。","It was the open sea, whose waves were still dashing with tremendous violence!It was the ocean, without any visible limits, even for those whose gaze, from their commanding position, extended over a radius of forty miles.The vast liquid plain, lashed without mercy by the storm, appeared as if covered with herds of furious chargers, whose white and disheveled crests were streaming in the wind.No land was in sight, not a solitary ship could be seen.It was necessary at any cost to arrest their downward course, and to prevent the balloon from being engulfed in the waves.The voyagers directed all their energies to this urgent work.But, notwithstanding their efforts, the balloon still fell, and at the same time shifted with the greatest rapidity, following the direction of the wind, that is to say, from the northeast to the southwest."
"这些不幸的人们所处的境地的确很可怖。很明显，他们已经无法掌控气球。他们的一切努力都于事无补。气球的气囊越来越瘪。气体不断外泄，没法堵住。很明显，气球下降的速度越来越快，正午过后，吊篮离洋面不到600英尺了。","Frightful indeed was the situation of these unfortunate men.They were evidently no longer masters of the machine.All their attempts were useless.The case of the balloon collapsed more and more.The gas escaped without any possibility of retaining it.Their descent was visibly accelerated, and soon after midday the car hung within 600 feet of the ocean."
"阻止气体外泄已经毫无可能，它从丝布气囊的一条大裂缝向外冲。吊篮里的重物全都扔掉了，重量轻了，因此乘客们还可以在空中支持几个钟头。但这仅仅是延缓了不可避免的灾难而已，如果天黑之前还没有陆地出现，乘客、吊舱和气球必然会葬身海底。","It was impossible to prevent the escape of gas, which rushed through a large rent in the silk.By lightening the car of all the articles which it contained, the passengers had been able to prolong their suspension in the air for a few hours.But the inevitable catastrophe could only be retarded, and if land did not appear before night, voyagers, car, and balloon must to a certainty vanish beneath the waves."
"这时，他们只能求助于仅存的应急手段。他们都是勇敢无畏的人，知道如何面对死亡。他们没有一句怨言。他们决心奋战到最后一刻，想方设法延迟气球坠落。吊舱只是一种柳树干做的篮子，无法浮着，他们也不可能想办法将其维持在海面上。","They now resorted to the only remaining expedient.They were truly dauntless men, who knew how to look death in the face.Not a single murmur escaped from their lips.They were determined to struggle to the last minute, to do anything to retard their fall.The car was only a sort of willow basket, unable to float, and there was not the slightest possibility of maintaining it on the surface of the sea."
"又是两个小时过去了，气球离水面不过400英尺了。","Two more hours passed and the balloon was scarcely 400 feet above the water."
"这时，一声洪亮的声音传来，从声音就知道，恐惧接近不了这人的内心。回答他的声音也没有流露出丝毫不坚定。“所有的东西都扔掉了吗？”“没有，还有2000金币。”一个沉重的袋子立刻落入海中。“气球上升了吗？”“上升了一点儿，但是一会儿还是要下降的。”“还有什么可以扔掉的吗？”“没了。”“对了，还有吊舱！”“让我们抓住网索，把吊舱扔到海里去吧！”","At that moment a loud voice, the voice of a man whose heart was inaccessible to fear, was heard.To this voice responded others not less determined.“Is everything thrown out?”“No, here are still 2,000 dollars in gold.”A heavy bag immediately plunged into the sea.“Does the balloon rise?”“A little, but it will not be long before it falls again.”“What still remains to be thrown out?”“Nothing.”“Yes! the car!”“Let us catch hold of the net, and into the sea with the car.”"
"事实上，这是最后也是唯一能够减轻气球重量的方法了。割断系着吊舱的绳索后，气球随之上升了2000英尺。五位乘客吊在气球网上，紧抓住网眼，凝视下方的无底深渊。","This was, in fact, the last and only mode of lightening the balloon.The ropes which held the car were cut, and the balloon, after its fall, mounted 2,000 feet.The five voyagers had hoisted themselves into the net, and clung to the meshes, gazing at the abyss."
"大家知道气球对于重力的增减很敏感。即使扔下最轻的东西，也足以改变它在垂直方向的位置。这个在空中的装置就像一个极为精确的天平。不难理解，只要减轻任何相当重量的东西，它就会立刻急剧上升。此时的情形就是如此。但是，在高处悬浮不久之后，气球又开始下降，气体从根本没法修补的裂缝向外跑。","The delicate sensibility of balloons is well known.It is sufficient to throw out the lightest article to produce a difference in its vertical position.The apparatus in the air is like a balance of mathematical precision.It can be thus easily understood that when it is lightened of any considerable weight its movement will be impetuous and sudden.So it happened on this occasion.But after being suspended for an instant aloft, the balloon began to redescend, the gas escaping by the rent which it was impossible to repair."
"这些人尽了全力。现在人力已不能挽救他们。","The men had done all that men could do.No human efforts could save them now."
"他们必须依靠统领一切的上帝的仁慈。","They must trust to the mercy of Him who rules the elements."
"在四点钟的时候，气球离海面仅仅不到500英尺。","At four o’clock the balloon was only 500 feet above the surface of the water."
"一声响亮的犬吠声传来。一只狗陪伴着旅行者，它紧紧地挨着主人，抓在网眼上。","A loud barking was heard.A dog accompanied the voyagers, and was held pressed close to his master in the meshes of the net."
"“托普看见什么了。”一个人大声喊。紧接着，又有一个人大声喊：","“Top has seen something,” cried one of the men.Then immediately a loud voice shouted,—"
"“陆地！陆地！”气球一直随风向西南漂行，从天亮到现在走了很远的距离，大概有几百英里，一个相当高的陆地其实已经出现在前方了。但是这片陆地还在30英里以外。要到达那里至少要一个小时，那么就有可能驶向背风面。","“Land! land!”The balloon, which the wind still drove towards the southwest, had since daybreak gone a considerable distance, which might be reckoned by hundreds of miles, and a tolerably high land had, in fact, appeared in that direction.But this land was still thirty miles off.It would not take less than an hour to get to it, and then there was the chance of falling to leeward."
"一个钟头！气球里仅存的一点气体会不会在到达那里之前全跑光呢？","An hour!Might not the balloon before that be emptied of all the fluid it yet retained?"
"这个问题很严峻！乘客们已经清晰地望见了坚实的陆地，他们不惜任何代价也要到达那里。他们并不知道那里是什么地方，是岛屿还是大陆？因为他们不知道飓风将他们吹到了地球的哪个角落。但是他们必须到那块陆地，不管那里是有人居住还是没有人烟，也不管那里欢迎他们与否。","Such was the terrible question!The voyagers could distinctly see that solid spot which they must reach at any cost.They were ignorant of what it was, whether an island or a continent, for they did not know to what part of the world the hurricane had driven them.But they must reach this land, whether inhabited or desolate, whether hospitable or not."
"很明显，气球已无法支持下去。好几次，巨大的浪花顶端轻轻拍打气球网的下部，气球更加沉重，悬浮在半空中，像一只翅膀受伤的鸟。半小时后，他们距陆地不过一英里之遥，但是气球已经耗尽气力，软绵无力、褶皱不堪地悬在那里，唯有上方还余下一些气体。乘客们紧紧抓住气球网，但气球仍是太重，不久半个身子就浸在水里了，汹涌的海浪拍打着他们。气囊又一次鼓起，在风力的作用下，它像船一样前行。没准它能这样到达陆地?","It was evident that the balloon could no longer support itself!Several times already had the crests of the enormous billows licked the bottom of the net, making it still heavier, and the balloon only half rose, like a bird with a wounded wing.Half an hour later the land was not more than a mile off, but the balloon, exhausted, flabby, hanging in great folds, had gas in its upper part alone.The voyagers, clinging to the net, were still too heavy for it, and soon, half plunged into the sea, they were beaten by the furious waves.The balloon-case bulged out again, and the wind, taking it, drove it along like a vessel.Might it not possibly thus reach the land?"
"但是，当离岸只有两英寻远时，四个人同时惊声尖叫起来。原以为绝不能再上升的气球，在一个巨浪的拍打下，竟出乎意料地再次上升。瞬间，气球似乎释放了一部分重量，高升到1500英尺的高空，又遇到一阵风，这阵风非但没把它吹向岸边，反而使它沿着和陆地几乎平行的方向飞去。","But, when only two fathoms off, terrible cries resounded from four pairs of lungs at once.The balloon, which had appeared as if it would never again rise, suddenly made an unexpected bound, after having been struck by a tremendous sea.As if it had been at that instant relieved of a new part of its weight, it mounted to a height of 1,500 feet, and here it met a current of wind, which instead of taking it directly to the coast, carried it in a nearly parallel direction."
"两分钟后它又斜转回来，最后降落在一块海浪冲击不到的沙滩上。","At last, two minutes later, it reproached obliquely, and finally fell on a sandy beach, out of the reach of the waves."
"乘客们互相帮助，从网眼中挣脱出来。气球失去了他们的重量，被风吹起，像一只受伤的鸟马上恢复了气力，消失在空中。","The voyagers, aiding each other, managed to disengage themselves from the meshes of the net.The balloon, relieved of their weight, was taken by the wind, and like a wounded bird which revives for an instant, disappeared into space."
"吊篮中原本载了五个人和一条狗，可是气球只留下四个人在岸上。","But the car had contained five passengers, with a dog, and the balloon only left four on the shore."
"失踪的那个人一定是在海浪冲击气球网时被冲走了，也正是这个缘故，重量减轻的气球最后一次上升，不久就着陆了。这四个遇险的人一踏上坚实的土地就都想到失踪的这个人，他们异口同声地喊道：“他大概会游上岸的。我们去救他，我们去救他！”","The missing person had evidently been swept off by the sea, which had just struck the net, and it was owing to this circumstance that the lightened balloon rose the last time, and then soon after reached the land.Scarcely had the four castaways set foot on firm ground, than they all, thinking of the absent one, simultaneously exclaimed, “Perhaps he will try to swim to land!Let us save him! let us save him!”"
"第二章","Chapter 2"
"这些被飓风抛到海岸上的人既不是专业气球驾驶员也不是业余驾驶员。他们曾经是战俘，大胆的劲儿促使他们用这种奇异的方式逃跑。","Those whom the hurricane had just thrown on this coast were neither aeronauts by profession nor amateurs.They were prisoners of war whose boldness had induced them to escape in this extraordinary manner."
"多少次他们都差点丧命！多少次他们都差点从破了的气球上摔下来，掉进深海中！但是因为奇怪的命数，上帝保全了他们的性命。他们3月20号从尤利西斯·格兰特率军包围的里士满城中逃了出来，现在离弗吉尼亚州的首府已经有7000英里了。在恐怖的南北战争中，弗吉尼亚是南军的大本营。他们已经在空中飞行了整整五天。","A hundred times they had almost perished!A hundred times had they almost fallen from their torn balloon into the depths of the ocean.But Heaven had reserved them for a strange destiny, and after having, on the 20th of March, escaped from Richmond, besieged by the troops of General Ulysses Grant, they found themselves seven thousand miles from the capital of Virginia, which was the principal stronghold of the South, during the terrible War of Secession.Their aerial voyage had lasted five days."
"正是下面不可思议的情形让这些战俘成功逃跑：","The curious circumstances which led to the escape of the prisoners were as follows:"
"就在同一年，1865年的二月间，为夺取里士满，格兰特将军组织了多次突袭行动，结果有一次以失败告终，他手下的几个军官都沦为战俘，被扣押在里士满城中。这其中最杰出的人就是赛勒斯·哈丁上尉。他是马萨诸塞州人，一个一流的工程师，在战争期间，曾受政府委托，管理当时极为重要的铁路系统。一个地地道道的北方人，瘦骨嶙峋，大约四十五岁，一头短发和胡子——只留了一撮的浓密的八字须，都已经变得灰白了。他的脸长得很端正，似乎生来就为了铸在勋章上，眼神犀利，嘴角严肃，一看就是军校出身的智多星。他也是从舞锤弄斧开始干起的工程师，就像普通士兵出身的将军一样。他不但智力超群，而且心灵手巧。他的肌肉使他显得非常强壮。他既是一个思想家，也一个行动家，他精力充沛，性情乐观，什么事情都难不倒他。他博学多识，冷静务实，在任何紧要关头都能拥有确保成功的三个条件——灵活的大脑和身体、强烈的愿望和坚强的意志。他将17世纪威廉三世的话当作座右铭：“即使没有一丝成功的希望，我也要负责并坚持下去。”赛勒斯·哈丁就是“胆量”的代名词。他参加过那场战争的每一场战役。他的军旅生涯从伊利诺斯州做志愿者开始，作为尤利赛斯·格兰特的手下，他参加过帕迪尤卡、贝尔蒙特战役，匹兹堡登陆战，以及科林斯、吉布森港、布莱克里弗、查塔努加、莽原和波托马克河包围战。在这些战役中，他始终骁勇善战，没有辜负格兰特将军说过的“我决不计算我军的伤亡”这句话。哈丁上尉有上百次都差点成为可怕的格兰特将军不计算在内的将士中的一员，但是在他身先士卒的这些战役中，好运一直伴随着他，直到在里士满附近的战场上受伤被俘为止。与此同时，在同一天，另一个重要人物也落入南军的手中。这不是别人，正是《纽约先驱报》的记者吉迪恩·史佩莱，他奉命跟随北军进行战地报道。","That same year, in the month of February, 1865, in one of the coups de main by which General Grant attempted, though in vain, to possess himself of Richmond, several of his officers fell into the power of the enemy and were detained in the town.One of the most distinguished was Captain Cyrus Harding.He was a native of Massachusetts, a first-class engineer, to whom the government had confided, during the war, the direction of the railways, which were so important at that time.A true Northerner, thin, bony, lean, about forty-five years of age; his close-cut hair and his beard, of which he only kept a thick mustache, were already getting gray.He had one of those finely-developed heads which appear made to be struck on a medal, piercing eyes, a serious mouth, the physiognomy of a clever man of the military school.He was one of those engineers who began by handling the hammer and pickaxe, like generals who first act as common soldiers.Besides mental power, he also possessed great manual dexterity.His muscles exhibited remarkable proofs of tenacity.A man of action as well as a man of thought, all he did was without effort to one of his vigorous and sanguine temperament.Learned, clear-headed, and practical, he fulfilled in all emergencies those three conditions which united ought to insure human success—activity of mind and body, impetuous wishes, and powerful will.He might have taken for his motto that of William of Orange in the 17th century: “I can undertake and persevere even without hope of success.”Cyrus Harding was courage personified.He had been in all the battles of that war.After having begun as a volunteer at Illinois, under Ulysses Grant, he fought at Paducah, Belmont, Pittsburg Landing, at the siege of Corinth, Port Gibson, Black River, Chattanooga, the Wilderness, on the Potomac, everywhere and valiantly, a soldier worthy of the general who said, “I never count my dead!”And hundreds of times Captain Harding had almost been among those who were not counted by the terrible Grant; but in these combats where he never spared himself, fortune favored him till the moment when he was wounded and taken prisoner on the field of battle near Richmond.At the same time and on the same day another important personage fell into the hands of the Southerners.This was no other than Gideon Spilen, a reporter for the New York Herald, who had been ordered to follow the changes of the war in the midst of the Northern armies."
"吉迪恩·史佩莱就像那些不屈不挠的英美编年史人员——比如斯坦利和其他人，不惜一切代价获取准确信息，并在最短时间里将信息传到报社。联邦的许多报纸，如《纽约先驱报》，都有真正的实力，它们的记者不可低估。吉迪恩·史佩莱是那些记者中首屈一指的，他具备很多优点：精力充沛，随机应变，满脑子都是主意；他曾环游世界，是一位战士也是一位艺术家；会议上激情洋溢，行动起来坚定不移，不怕麻烦、劳累和危险；在追踪战况时，首先满足自己的需要，再为报社考虑；他对各种新奇的话题都有涉猎，许多没有发表过、别人不知道也没法采访到的事情他都知道。他就是那些不畏艰险的战地观察员之一，在枪林弹雨中报道，危险就是他们想要的报道资料。","Gideon Spilett was one of that race of indomitable English or American chroniclers, like Stanley and others, who stop at nothing to obtain exact information, and transmit it to their journal in the shortest possible time.The newspapers of the Union, such as the New York Herald, are genuine powers, and their reporters are men to be reckoned with.Gideon Spilett ranked among the first of those reporters: a man of great merit, energetic, prompt and ready for anything, full of ideas, having traveled over the whole world, soldier and artist, enthusiastic in council, resolute in action, caring neither for trouble, fatigue, nor danger, when in pursuit of information, for himself first, and then for his journal, a perfect treasury of knowledge on all sorts of curious subjects, of the unpublished, of the unknown, and of the impossible.He was one of those intrepid observers who write under fire, “reporting” among bullets, and to whom every danger is welcome."
"他参加过各次战役，在前线报道时，一手握着左轮手枪，一手拿着笔记本，葡萄弹也不会使他手中的笔颤抖。他不像有些记者没话找话说，没完没了的电报使线路陷入疲劳，他的每一篇报道都简短有力、中心明确，对关键点做了清晰的阐释。此外，他也不乏幽默感。就是他在布莱克里弗战役后，决心不计任何代价保证电报局窗口的位置，向报社报道完战役结果后，又用两小时拍发了“圣经”的前几章。虽然花了2000美元，但是《纽约先驱报》首先刊登了这个消息。","He also had been in all the battles, in the first rank, revolver in one hand, note-book in the other; grape-shot never made his pencil tremble.He did not fatigue the wires with incessant telegrams, like those who speak when they have nothing to say, but each of his notes, short, decisive, and clear, threw light on some important point.Besides, he was not wanting in humor.It was he who, after the affair of the Black River, determined at any cost to keep his place at the wicket of the telegraph office, and after having announced to his journal the result of the battle, telegraphed for two hours the first chapters of the Bible.It cost the New York Herald two thousand dollars, but the New York Herald published the first intelligence."
"吉迪恩·史佩莱个子很高。他不止四十岁。淡红色的胡须围绕着他的脸庞。他的目光沉稳而充满生气，变化迅速。他的眼睛习惯于一眼就把握事件的所有细节。他体格健壮，能够适应各种气候，就像一根在冷水中淬硬了的钢棍。","Gideon Spilett was tall.He was rather more than forty years of age.Light whiskers bordering on red surrounded his face.His eye was steady, lively, rapid in its changes.It was the eye of a man accustomed to take in at a glance all the details of a scene.Well built, he was inured to all climates, like a bar of steel hardened in cold water."
"他担任《纽约先驱报》的记者有十个年头了，他的文字和插图丰富了报刊的内容，他的绘画功底和写作功底一样出色。他被捕时正在写报道、绘战役素描。他笔记本的最后几个字是这样的：“一个南军正拿枪对着我，但是——”尽管如此，他素来有好运气，南军没有射中他，在这次事件中他毫发未伤。","For ten years Gideon Spilett had been the reporter of the New York Herald, which he enriched by his letters and drawings, for he was as skilful in the use of the pencil as of the pen.When he was captured, he was in the act of making a description and sketch of the battle.The last words in his note-book were these: “A Southern rifleman has just taken aim at me, but—” The Southerner notwithstanding missed Gideon Spilett, who, with his usual fortune, came out of this affair without a scratch."
"在此之前，赛勒斯·哈丁和吉迪恩·史佩莱没有交情，只是耳闻对方大名，现在他们都被带到里士满。工程师的伤很快就痊愈了，他在康复期间结识了这位记者。随着交往的深入，两个人都互相赏识起来。很快他们就有了一个共同的目标，那就是逃出里士满，重新加入格兰特的军队，和联邦军队并肩战斗。","Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett, who did not know each other except by reputation, had both been carried to Richmond.The engineer’s wounds rapidly healed, and it was during his convalescence that he made acquaintance with the reporter.The two men then learned to appreciate each other.Soon their common aim had but one object, that of escaping, rejoining Grant’s army, and fighting together in the ranks of the Federals."
"从一开始，他们两个就决心抓住每一个机会逃跑。尽管他们获准在城中自由走动，但里士满戒备森严，似乎没有逃跑的可能性。在此期间，哈丁上尉与昔日的仆人重逢，这个仆人对他忠心耿耿、生死不渝。这个无畏的家伙是一个黑人，就出生在工程师家里，父母也都是奴隶，但是赛勒斯是一个忠实的废奴主义者，早已经给他自由。这个昔日的的“奴隶”即使恢复自由身，依然不愿离开自己的主人。他情愿为主人而死。他大约三十岁，精力充沛，积极活跃，聪明伶俐，温顺稳重，时而又有天真的一面，总是很开心，是一个热心助人又实在的人。他叫纳布甲尼撒，但只习惯别人叫他的简称纳布。","The two Americans had from the first determined to seize every chance; but although they were allowed to wander at liberty in the town, Richmond was so strictly guarded, that escape appeared impossible.In the meanwhile Captain Harding was rejoined by a servant who was devoted to him in life and in death.This intrepid fellow was a Negro born on the engineer’s estate, of a slave father and mother, but to whom Cyrus, who was an Abolitionist from conviction and heart, had long since given his freedom.The once slave, though free, would not leave his master.He would have died for him.He was a man of about thirty, vigorous, active, clever, intelligent, gentle, and calm, sometimes naive, always merry, obliging, and honest.His name was Nebuchadnezzar, but he only answered to the familiar abbreviation of Neb."
"当纳布听到主人被俘的消息后，毫不犹豫地离开马萨诸塞州前往里士满，他凭着计谋和精明，20多次冒着生命危险潜入被围的城中。哈丁见到仆人和纳布找到主人的喜悦之情是无法言表的。","When Neb heard that his master had been made prisoner, he left Massachusetts without hesitating an instant, arrived before Richmond, and by dint of stratagem and shrewdness, after having risked his life twenty times over, managed to penetrate into the besieged town.The pleasure of Harding on seeing his servant, and the joy of Neb at finding his master, can scarcely be described."
"虽然纳布能够潜入里士满城，但是再次出城就是另外一回事了，因为北军的俘虏在这里被严密地看管起来。不管成功的几率怎样，他们都需要碰到特别的机会为此一搏。不过这种机会不但不会自己送上门来，还很难寻找到。","But though Neb had been able to make his way into Richmond, it was quite another thing to get out again, for the Northern prisoners were very strictly watched.Some extraordinary opportunity was needed to make the attempt with any chance of success, and this opportunity not only did not present itself, but was very difficult to find."
"在此期间，格兰特继续率领军队骁勇作战。格兰特为彼得斯堡的胜利付出了沉重代价。在到达里士满之前，他的部队与巴特莱的部队联合进攻都不能取得胜利，没有什么事能给战俘带来早日释放的希望。","Meanwhile Grant continued his energetic operations.The victory of Petersburg had been very dearly bought.His forces, united to those of Butler, had as yet been unsuccessful before Richmond, and nothing gave the prisoners any hope of a speedy deliverance."
"对于记者来说，这枯燥乏味的俘虏生活没有一点值得记录，他再也忍受不下去了。他向来活跃的大脑现在只想着一件事——不惜任何代价逃出里士满。他先前几次尝试出城，但被无法克服的障碍挡住了。围困还在继续着，不仅战俘们急于逃回格兰特的军队，被围困的人们肯定也急于与南军会合。乔纳森·福斯特就是其中的一员，他是一个坚定的南方人。事实上，在北军的重重包围下，如果南军的俘虏们无法逃出城，南军自身也是束手无策的。里士满总督与李将军失去联系已经有很长时间了，他非常希望将里士满的局势告知将军，以使援军尽快来救他们。于是乔纳森·福斯特萌生了升起气球的想法，这样就可以越过包围线到达南军营地。","The reporter, to whom his tedious captivity did not offer a single incident worthy of note, could stand it no longer.His usually active mind was occupied with one sole thought—how he might get out of Richmond at any cost.Several times had he even made the attempt, but was stopped by some insurmountable obstacle.However, the siege continued; and if the prisoners were anxious to escape and join Grant’s army, certain of the besieged were no less anxious to join the Southern forces.Among them was one Jonathan Forster, a determined Southerner.The truth was, that if the prisoners of the Secessionists could not leave the town, neither could the Secessionists themselves while the Northern army invested it.The Governor of Richmond for a long time had been unable to communicate with General Lee, and he very much wished to make known to him the situation of the town, so as to hasten the march of the army to their relief.Thus Jonathan Forster accordingly conceived the idea of rising in a balloon, so as to pass over the besieging lines, and in that way reach the Secessionist camp."
"总督批准了他的计划。他们造了一只气球供福斯特使用，另外还派了五个人做陪同。为这些人配备了武器和食品，以备降落时自卫和航程延长时使用。","The Governor authorized the attempt.A balloon was manufactured and placed at the disposal of Forster, who was to be accompanied by five other persons.They were furnished with arms in case they might have to defend themselves when they alighted, and provisions in the event of their aerial voyage being prolonged."
"气球定在3月18号起飞。起飞需要在夜间进行，还要有和缓的西北风。据飞行员估计，他们在几个小时之内就可以到达李将军的军营了。","The departure of the balloon was fixed for the 18th of March.It should be effected during the night, with a northwest wind of moderate force, and the aeronauts calculated that they would reach General Lee’s camp in a few hours."
"但是西北风不仅仅是微风。从18日起它分明已经变成飓风了。风暴很快变得猛烈，福斯特动身的日期只好推迟，因为在这样的恶劣天气下，不能拿气球和乘客的生命冒险。","But this northwest wind was not a simple breeze.From the 18th it was evident that it was changing to a hurricane.The tempest soon became such that Forster’s departure was deferred, for it was impossible to risk the balloon and those whom it carried in the midst of the furious elements."
"充满气的气球拴在城中的大广场上，只要风力一减弱就会起飞，被困在城中的人们当然非常焦灼地等着暴风变弱。","The balloon, inflated on the great square of Richmond, was ready to depart on the first abatement of the wind, and, as may be supposed, the impatience among the besieged to see the storm moderate was very great."
"18、19号都过去了，天气还是没改变。将气球拴在地面都变得相当困难，因为咆哮的狂风冲撞撕扯着气球。","The 18th, the 19th of March passed without any alteration in the weather.There was even great difficulty in keeping the balloon fastened to the ground, as the squalls dashed it furiously about."
"19号晚上过去了，但是第二天暴风更加猛烈了。气球起飞是不可能了。","The night of the 19th passed, but the next morning the storm blew with redoubled force.The departure of the balloon was impossible."
"那天，工程师赛勒斯·哈丁在城中的街道上被一个素未谋面的人叫住了。这就是水手潘克洛夫，他大约在35到40岁之间，体格强壮，皮肤被晒得黝黑，两眼炯炯有神，帅气十足。潘克洛夫是美国人，来自北方，航遍了各大洋，凡是两条腿没翅膀的生物所能冒的险他都冒过，甚至包括那些我们不可能经历的冒险。不用说，他是大胆、勇猛的家伙，随时准备历险，对什么都不会大惊小怪。潘克洛夫年初时带着一个15岁男孩来里士满出差，男孩是新泽西州人，前船长的儿子，现在是个孤儿。潘克洛夫疼爱他就像是疼爱自己的亲生骨肉一样。在里士满第一次被围攻之前，他没能离开，等到发觉自己已经被困时，他相当懊丧，但从不向困难低头的他决心想法子逃出去。他早就听过这位工程师军官的大名，深知他坚韧外表下被抑制住的焦灼苦闷。因此，那天他没有拐弯抹角，毫不犹豫地向他打招呼，问道：“上尉阁下，你在里士满呆够了吗？”","On that day the engineer, Cyrus Harding, was accosted in one of the streets of Richmond by a person whom he did not in the least know.This was a sailor named Pencroft, a man of about thirty-five or forty years of age, strongly built, very sunburnt, and possessed of a pair of bright sparkling eyes and a remarkably good physiognomy.Pencroft was an American from the North, who had sailed all the ocean over, and who had gone through every possible and almost impossible adventure that a being with two feet and no wings would encounter.It is needless to say that he was a bold, dashing fellow, ready to dare anything and was astonished at nothing.Pencroft at the beginning of the year had gone to Richmond on business, with a young boy of fifteen from New Jersey, son of a former captain, an orphan, whom he loved as if he had been his own child.Not having been able to leave the town before the first operations of the siege, he found himself shut up, to his great disgust; but, not accustomed to succumb to difficulties, he resolved to escape by some means or other.He knew the engineer-officer by reputation; he knew with what impatience that determined man chafed under his restraint.On this day he did not, therefore, hesitate to accost him, saying, without circumlocution, “Have you had enough of Richmond, captain?”"
"工程师直愣愣地盯着眼前说话的这个人，对方又低声补充道：","The engineer looked fixedly at the man who spoke, and who added, in a low voice,—"
"“哈丁上尉，你打算逃跑吗？”","“Captain Harding, will you try to escape?”"
"“什么时候？”工程师很快问道，很显然工程师是不假思索地说出这句话，因为他至今还没审视这个说话人。他敏锐的目光细细打量着说话人的面孔后，确信面前的这个人是诚实的。","“When?” asked the engineer quickly, and it was evident that this question was uttered without consideration, for he had not yet examined the stranger who addressed him.But after having with a penetrating eye observed the open face of the sailor, he was convinced that he had before him an honest man."
"“你是谁？”他简短地问道。","“Who are you?” he asked briefly."
"潘克洛夫作了自我介绍。","Pencroft made himself known."
"“好吧，”哈丁答道，“你打算怎么走？”","“Well,” replied Harding, “and in what way do you propose to escape?”"
"“用那只热气球，它在那里闲着没用，我看它似乎是特意为我们预备的……”","“By that lazy balloon which is left there doing nothing, and which looks to me as if it was waiting on purpose for us—”"
"水手没有必要把话说完。工程师马上明白了他的意思。他抓住潘克洛夫的手，将他拉到自己的住处。在那里，水手详细地说了自己的计划，计划实在是再简单不过了。实行计划除了有生命危险外，也没有其他风险了。毫无疑问，飓风正奋力肆虐着，但是对像赛勒斯·哈丁这样聪明又胆识过人的人来说，操纵气球是易如反掌的事。假如潘克洛夫对飞行技术像对航海那样熟悉，他一定早就毫不犹豫地带着他的小朋友赫伯特出发了，他习惯了惊涛骇浪，不会因为飓风而停住。哈丁上尉一言不发地听着水手的计划，但眼中闪烁着满意的光芒。这正是他寻觅了很久的机会，他不会错失良机。计划是可行的，但必须承认的是，它也十分危险。尽管有看守，但他们可以趁夜晚靠近气球，潜入吊舱，然后割断系住吊舱的绳索。毋庸置疑的是他们可能被打死，但另一方面，他们也可能成功，如果没有这场风暴该多好啊！但如果没有这次飓风，气球早就起飞了，他们苦苦寻觅的机会也就不复存在了。","There was no necessity for the sailor to finish his sentence.The engineer understood him at once.He seized Pencroft by the arm, and dragged him to his house.There the sailor developed his project, which was indeed extremely simple.They risked nothing but their lives in its execution.The hurricane was in all its violence, it is true, but so clever and daring an engineer as Cyrus Harding knew perfectly well how to manage a balloon.Had he himself been as well acquainted with the art of sailing in the air as he was with the navigation of a ship, Pencroft would not have hesitated to set out, of course taking his young friend Herbert with him; for, accustomed to brave the fiercest tempests of the ocean, he was not to be hindered on account of the hurricane.Captain Harding had listened to the sailor without saying a word, but his eyes shone with satisfaction.Here was the long-sought-for opportunity—he was not a man to let it pass.The plan was feasible, though, it must be confessed, dangerous in the extreme.In the night, in spite of their guards, they might approach the balloon, slip into the car, and then cut the cords which held it.There was no doubt that they might be killed, but on the other hand they might succeed, and without this storm!—Without this storm the balloon would have started already and the looked-for opportunity would not have then presented itself."
"“我不是一个人！”哈丁最后说道。","“I am not alone!” said Harding at last."
"“你会带多少人？”水手问道。","“How many people do you wish to bring with you?” asked the sailor."
"“两个，我的朋友史佩莱，还有我的仆人纳布。”","“Two; my friend Spilett, and my servant Neb.”"
"“那就是三个人了，”潘克洛夫说，“加上赫伯特和我一共是五个人。气球能载六个——”","“That will be three,” replied Pencroft; “and with Herbert and me five.But the balloon will hold six—”"
"“那就行了，我们动身吧。”哈丁坚决地说。","“That will be enough, we will go,” answered Harding in a firm voice."
"这个“我们”包括史佩莱，因为哈丁非常了解这位记者不是临阵退缩的人，当史佩莱听到这个计划之后，完全同意了。最让他惊奇的是，这么简单的想法自己以前竟然没有想到。至于纳布，不管他的主人去哪儿，他都会跟着。","This “we” included Spilett, for the reporter, as his friend well knew, was not a man to draw back, and when the project was communicated to him he approved of it unreservedly.What astonished him was, that so simple an idea had not occurred to him before.As to Neb, he followed his master wherever his master wished to go."
"“就今天晚上出发吧，”潘克洛夫说，“我们就在那里会面。”","“This evening, then,” said Pencroft, “we will all meet out there.”"
"“今天晚上十点钟，”哈丁答道，“上天保佑，在我们出发之前风势不要减弱。”","“This evening, at ten o’clock,” replied Captain Harding; “and Heaven grant that the storm does not abate before our departure.”"
"潘克洛夫辞别了工程师和记者，回到了自己的寓所，年轻的赫伯特·布朗还呆在那里。这个勇敢的少年知道水手的计划，焦急地等待着工程师的答复。就这样，这五个意志坚定的人决定将命运交在暴风手中了！","Pencroft took leave of the two friends, and returned to his lodging, where young Herbert Brown had remained.The courageous boy knew of the sailor’s plan, and it was not without anxiety that he awaited the result of the proposal being made to the engineer.Thus five determined persons were about to abandon themselves to the mercy of the tempestuous elements!"
"没有！暴风雨没有减弱！乔纳森·福斯特和他的朋友们都没想到要在脆弱的吊舱中冒这么大的风险。","No! the storm did not abate, and neither Jonathan Forster nor his companions dreamed of confronting it in that frail car."
"这将是一场可怕的旅行。工程师只担心一件事，那就是拴在地面上、受风蹂躏的气球会被撕扯成碎片。他在几乎无人的广场上逛了好几个小时，仔细检查着这只气球。潘克洛夫也做着同他朋友一样的事情，他把双手插在口袋里，不时打着哈欠，好像一个不知怎样消磨时间的人，但实际上，他心里和工程师一样恐惧，害怕风把气球刮跑或把气球撕裂。夜幕降临了。夜非常黑。像乌云一样的大雾弥漫着大地。雨夹着雪从天上落下，天气冷极了。浓雾笼罩着里士满，暴风雨似乎使攻守双方休战了，大炮的声响在怒吼的狂风中也一点也听不到了。城市的街道上不见一个人影。在这么恶劣的天气下，政府甚至都觉得没有必要对气球所在的广场设岗看守。一切都对这些囚徒的逃跑有利，但是，他们在狂风暴雨中谋划的危险旅程会有什么结果呢？","It would be a terrible journey.The engineer only feared one thing; it was that the balloon, held to the ground and dashed about by the wind, would be torn into shreds.For several hours he roamed round the nearly-deserted square, surveying the apparatus.Pencroft did the same on his side, his hands in his pockets, yawning now and then like a man who did not know how to kill the time, but really dreading, like his friend, either the escape or destruction of the balloon.Evening arrived.The night was dark in the extreme.Thick mists passed like clouds close to the ground.Rain fell mingled with snow. it was very cold.A mist hung over Richmond. it seemed as if the violent storm had produced a truce between the besiegers and the besieged, and that the cannon were silenced by the louder detonations of the storm.The streets of the town were deserted.It had not even appeared necessary in that horrible weather to place a guard in the square, in the midst of which plunged the balloon.Everything favored the departure of the prisoners, but what might possibly be the termination of the hazardous voyage they contemplated in the midst of the furious elements?—"
"“烂天气！”潘克洛夫叫喊着，一拳压住了头上的帽子，“哼，我们照样会成功的！”","“Dirty weather!” exclaimed Pencroft, fixing his hat firmly on his head with a blow of his fist; “but pshaw, we shall succeed all the same!”"
"九点半时，哈丁和他的同伴从各个方向悄悄潜入广场，汽灯被大风吹灭了，广场上一片漆黑。连那只几乎被吹倒在地面上的大气球都看不见了。网索单独系在砂囊上，吊舱通过一根结实的缆线系在人行道的铁环上。五个人在吊舱旁会合了。没人发现他们，周围一片漆黑，他们甚至看不见彼此。","At half-past nine, Harding and his companions glided from different directions into the square, which the gas-lamps, extinguished by the wind, had left in total obscurity.Even the enormous balloon, almost beaten to the ground, could not be seen.Independently of the sacks of ballast, to which the cords of the net were fastened, the car was held by a strong cable passed through a ring in the pavement.The five prisoners met by the car.They had not been perceived, and such was the darkness that they could not even see each other."
"哈丁、史佩莱、纳布和赫伯特一言不发地各自上了吊篮，潘克洛夫按照工程师的指示把绑在砂囊上的网索一一解开。不用几分钟功夫，水手就回到他的同伴身边了。","Without speaking a word, Harding, Spilett, Neb, and Herbert took their places in the car, while Pencroft by the engineer’s order detached successively the bags of ballast.It was the work of a few minutes only, and the sailor rejoined his companions."
"现在系着气球的只剩下那根缆线了，只要工程师一声令下就可以起飞了。","The balloon was then only held by the cable, and the engineer had nothing to do but to give the word."
"就在这时候，突然有一只狗一跃跳进吊篮里。原来是工程师的爱犬托普。这个忠诚的小家伙挣断了锁链，跟上了它的主人。哈丁担心狗的重量会妨碍气球上升，想打发它走。","At that moment a dog sprang with a bound into the car.It was Top, a favorite of the engineer.The faithful creature, having broken his chain, had followed his master.He, however, fearing that its additional weight might impede their ascent, wished to send away the animal."
"“多了它不会有什么两样，可怜的畜生！”潘克洛夫又将两袋沙子扔了下去，说话间他已经松开缆索，气球斜着升上天空，撞上了两个烟囱后，就消失在空中了。","“One more will make but little difference, poor beast!” exclaimed Pencroft, heaving out two bags of sand, and as he spoke letting go the cable; the balloon ascending in an oblique direction, disappeared, after having dashed the car against two chimneys, which it threw down as it swept by them."
"之后，飓风的强大威力完全显现在这群航行者面前。那天夜里，工程师不敢想象如何降落，拂晓的时候，下面的大地被浓雾遮得一点也看不见。","Then, indeed, the full rage of the hurricane was exhibited to the voyagers.During the night the engineer could not dream of descending, and when day broke, even a glimpse of the earth below was intercepted by fog."
"五天以后他们才从云隙中看到下面浩瀚的大海，现在狂风已在海上卷起惊涛骇浪。","Five days had passed when a partial clearing allowed them to see the wide extending ocean beneath their feet, now lashed into the maddest fury by the gale."
"我们的读者都知道发生在这五个人身上的事，他们在3月20号乘气球开始这场冒险旅程。五天过后，他们中的四个人被抛在荒凉的海岸线上，离自己的国家有7000英里。但是他们中的一个不见了，这个人就是他们的领袖，他们的精神向导——工程师哈丁！他们一起身，就赶紧跑到海滩上，打算去帮助他。","Our readers will recollect what befell these five daring individuals who set out on their hazardous expedition in the balloon on the 20th of March.Five days afterwards four of them were thrown on a desert coast, seven thousand miles from their country!But one of their number was missing, the man who was to be their guide, their leading spirit, the engineer, Captain Harding!The instant they had recovered their feet, they all hurried to the beach in the hopes of rendering him assistance."
"第三章","Chapter 3"
"工程师从网眼掉下去之后就被海浪冲走了。他的狗也不见了。这只忠诚的狗主动跳了出去救它的主人。“往前走啊！”记者喊道，紧接着这四个人——史佩莱、赫伯特、潘克洛夫和纳布忘记了疲劳，开始寻找。可怜的纳布流下痛苦的泪，一想到可能已经失去了世界上他唯一敬爱的人，就陷入绝望。","The engineer, the meshes of the net having given way, had been carried off by a wave.His dog also had disappeared.The faithful animal had voluntarily leaped out to help his master.“Forward,” cried the reporter; and all four, Spilett, Herbert, Pencroft, and Neb, forgetting their fatigue, began their search.Poor Neb shed bitter tears, giving way to despair at the thought of having lost the only being he loved on earth."
"赛勒斯·哈丁失踪两分钟之后，他的伙伴们就着陆了。因此，他们希望能及时赶过去救他。纳布喊道：“我们去找他！我们去找他！”","Only two minutes had passed from the time when Cyrus Harding disappeared to the moment when his companions set foot on the ground.They had hopes therefore of arriving in time to save him.“Let us look for him! let us look for him!” cried Neb."
"“好的，纳布，”吉丁·史佩莱回答道，“我们也一定会找到他！”","“Yes, Neb,” replied Gideon Spilett, “and we will find him too!”"
"“他一定还活着，我确信！”","“Living, I trust!”"
"“一定还活着！”","“Still living!”"
"“他会游泳吗？”潘克洛夫问道。","“Can he swim?” asked Pencroft."
"“会，”纳布回答道，“再说，托普也跟他在一起。”","“Yes,” replied Neb, “and besides, Top is there.”"
"水手注视着拍岸的惊涛骇浪，摇了摇头。","The sailor, observing the heavy surf on the shore, shook his head."
"工程师是在海岸的北部失踪的，与这群落难者着陆的位置相隔将近半英里。因而这也就意味着，他距离能够上岸的最近的海滩足有半英里。","The engineer had disappeared to the north of the shore, and nearly half a mile from the place where the castaways had landed.The nearest point of the beach he could reach was thus fully that distance off."
"这时候已经快六点钟了。浓雾使天色愈加昏暗。这群落难者朝这块陆地的北部走去，他们落到这块土地上纯属偶然，这是一个未知的区域，他们甚至无从猜测其地理位置。他们在混杂着石头、看上去寸草不生的沙地上行走着。地面高低不平，一些地方满是坑洞，行走起来极为痛苦。从这些坑洞中不停地飞出一些大鸟，笨拙地朝四面八方飞去。还有一些动作灵敏的鸟像云一样，成群地从他们的头上掠过。水手觉得自己认出了海鸥和鸬鹚，它们的尖叫声盖过了海浪咆哮的声音。","It was then nearly six o’clock.A thick fog made the night very dark.The castaways proceeded toward the north of the land on which chance had thrown them, an unknown region, the geographical situation of which they could not even guess.They were walking upon a sandy soil, mingled with stones, which appeared destitute of any sort of vegetation.The ground, very unequal and rough, was in some places perfectly riddled with holes, making walking extremely painful.From these holes escaped every minute great birds of clumsy flight, which flew in all directions.Others, more active, rose in flocks and passed in clouds over their heads.The sailor thought he recognized gulls and cormorants, whose shrill cries rose above the roaring of the sea."
"这群落难者时不时地停下来呼喊，听海上有没有回应。因为他们认为，如果工程师已经上岸，而他们离那里不远，即便哈丁自己无法传递他还活着的信号，他们也能听到托普的吠声。他们停下来细听，但是没有声音盖过奔涌的海水和怒吼的海浪声。他们一群人又接着朝前走，找遍了海岸的每个角落。","From time to time the castaways stopped and shouted, then listened for some response from the ocean, for they thought that if the engineer had landed, and they had been near to the place, they would have heard the barking of the dog Top, even should Harding himself have been unable to give any sign of existence.They stopped to listen, but no sound arose above the roaring of the waves and the dashing of the surf.The little band then continued their march forward, searching into every hollow of the shore."
"大约走了20分钟之后，这四个落难者看到脚边就是翻滚着泡沫的巨浪，突然停了下来。这里已是陆地的尽头。他们发现自己已经到了一个岬角的顶端，海浪正猛烈地冲击着这里。","After walking for twenty minutes, the four castaways were suddenly brought to a standstill by the sight of foaming billows close to their feet.The solid ground ended here.They found themselves at the extremity of a sharp point on which the sea broke furiously."
"“这是个海角，”水手说，“我们必须原路返回，靠右边走，这样我们应该能返回陆地了。”","“It is a promontory,” said the sailor; “we must retrace our steps, holding towards the right, and we shall thus gain the mainland.”"
"“但是说不定他就在那里。”纳布指着黑暗中白浪翻滚的大海说道。“好吧，我们再喊几声试试。”于是他们又一同大喊了几声，但是依旧没有回应。他们稍停了一下，又接着喊了几声，但还是没有回应。","“But if he is there,” said Neb, pointing to the ocean, whose waves shone of a snowy white in the darkness.“Well, let us call again,” and all uniting their voices, they gave a vigorous shout, but there came no reply.They waited for a lull, then began again; still no reply."
"这群落难者只好沿着海角的另一面路返回了，脚下的土地依然遍布沙子、崎岖不平。但是，潘克托夫观察到这边的海岸线比较平直，地面也越来越高，他说这里由一个长长的斜坡通向一座小山。透过浓雾，他认为能隐隐约约看到小山宽大正面的轮廓。海岸的这边，鸟儿没那么多了，海水也没那么喧嚣了，而且他们发现翻滚的巨浪也渐渐平息了。海浪的嘈杂声也几乎听不到了。显然，海角的这一面形成了一个半圆形的海湾，海浪冲击着海角的尖端，将他隐藏起来。但是沿着这个方向走下去就是南面了，正好与哈丁可能着陆的那部分海岸相对。行走了一英里半之后，他们发现海岸上没有返回北面的拐角。这个海角一定是和大陆相连的，他们曾经在这里转过方向。虽然这群落难者已经筋疲力尽了，但他们还是鼓起勇气往前走，每时每刻都希望能突然遇到一个拐角，将他们带回原来的方向。他们步履艰难地走了将近两英里后，到了一个满是滑溜溜岩石的高地上，而前面的大海再次挡住了去路，他们感到非常失望。","The castaways accordingly returned, following the opposite side of the promontory, over a soil equally sandy and rugged.However, Pencroft observed that the shore was more equal, that the ground rose, and he declared that it was joined by a long slope to a hill, whose massive front he thought that he could see looming indistinctly through the mist.The birds were less numerous on this part of the shore; the sea was also less tumultuous, and they observed that the agitation of the waves was diminished.The noise of the surf was scarcely heard.This side of the promontory evidently formed a semicircular bay, which the sharp point sheltered from the breakers of the open sea.But to follow this direction was to go south, exactly opposite to that part of the coast where Harding might have landed.After a walk of a mile and a half, the shore presented no curve which would permit them to return to the north.This promontory, of which they had turned the point, must be attached to the mainland.The castaways, although their strength was nearly exhausted, still marched courageously forward, hoping every moment to meet with a sudden angle which would set them in the first direction.What was their disappointment, when, after trudging nearly two miles, having reached an elevated point composed of slippery rocks, they found themselves again stopped by the sea."
"“我们是在一个小岛上，”潘克托夫说道，“而且我们已经从它的这一头勘察到另一头了。”","“We are on an islet,” said Pencroft, “and we have surveyed it from one extremity to the other.”"
"水手的话没错，他们坠落的地方不是一个大陆，也不是一个岛屿，而是一个长度不超过两英里的小岛，宽度就更不用说了。","The sailor was right; they had been thrown, not on a continent, not even on an island, but on an islet which was not more than two miles in length, with even a less breadth."
"这片海鸟栖息的荒凉贫瘠之地，遍布石头，寸草不生，它是不是还和比较重要的群岛相连呢？这还很难说。他们在吊舱里的时候，曾透过浓雾看到了陆地，但是没能充分勘察清楚。但是潘克洛夫那双水手的眼睛能透过黑暗的夜色，他几乎可以断定西边那难以辨认的大团黑影就是隆起的海岸。但是在黑暗中，他们不能确定这到底是一个孤岛，还是和其他岛屿相连。由于周围都是大海，他们也没有办法离开这里，因而他们不得不等到第二天再接着寻找工程师。天啊！他们听不到一声呼喊，不知道工程师是否还活着。","Was this barren spot the desolate refuge of sea-birds, strewn with stones and destitute of vegetation, attached to a more important archipelago?It was impossible to say.When the voyagers from their car saw the land through the mist, they had not been able to reconnoiter it sufficiently.However, Pencroft, accustomed with his sailor eyes to piece through the gloom, was almost certain that he could clearly distinguish in the west confused masses which indicated an elevated coast.But they could not in the dark determine whether it was a single island, or connected with others.They could not leave it either, as the sea surrounded them; they must therefore put off till the next day their search for the engineer, from whom, alas! not a single cry had reached them to show that he was still in existence."
"“我们的朋友没有动静，但这并不能说明什么，”记者说，“也许他晕倒了，或是受伤了，不能马上回应我们，所以我们不要绝望。”","“The silence of our friend proves nothing,” said the reporter.“Perhaps he has fainted or is wounded, and unable to reply directly, so we will not despair.”"
"接着，记者提议在小岛上点燃一堆火，这样可以给工程师提供信号。他们试图寻找一些树枝或是干枯的荆棘，但是却一无所获，这里尽是些沙子和石头。纳布和伙伴们都非常担心勇敢的哈丁的安危，他们的悲伤之情用文字不足以表达，只能靠读者的想象了。显然他们无力帮助他了。他们拿出白天的忍耐力来等待。工程师要么已经自救了，在海岸的某个地方找到了安身之处，要么就永远消失了。时间一分一秒地过去，漫长而痛苦。寒气逼人。这群落难者的处境十分糟糕，但是他们几乎没有意识到这些。他们甚至没有想过休息一会儿。他们将一切置于脑后，一心只想着他们的首领，怀着希望，或者说尽量往好处想，继续在这块贫瘠的土地上来回走动，总是回到小岛的北边——离出事地点最近的地方。他们听着、叫着、一同呼喊着，尽力使喊叫声更加响亮，传到远方。风声渐渐平息，大海的喧嚣声也开始减弱了。甚至在纳布的一次呼喊后，似乎还传来了回声。赫伯特提醒潘克洛夫注意纳布的回声：“那说明西边有海岸，而且距离应该不远。”水手点了点头，况且，他的眼睛也不会欺骗他。如果他发现了陆地，无论看起来多么模糊，那肯定就是陆地。但是从远处传来的回声就是对纳布呼喊的唯一回应了，而小岛的整个东部都笼罩在黑暗之中。","The reporter then proposed to light a fire on a point of the islet, which would serve as a signal to the engineer.But they searched in vain for wood or dry brambles; nothing but sand and stones were to be found.The grief of Neb and his companions, who were all strongly attached to the intrepid Harding, can be better pictured than described.It was too evident that they were powerless to help him.They must wait with what patience they could for daylight.Either the engineer had been able to save himself, and had already found a refuge on some point of the coast, or he was lost for ever!The long and painful hours passed by.The cold was intense.The castaways suffered cruelly, but they scarcely perceived it.They did not even think of taking a minute’s rest.Forgetting everything but their chief, hoping or wishing to hope on, they continued to walk up and down on this sterile spot, always returning to its northern point, where they could approach nearest to the scene of the catastrophe.They listened, they called, and then uniting their voices, they endeavored to raise even a louder shout than before, which would be transmitted to a great distance.The wind had now fallen almost to a calm, and the noise of the sea began also to subside.One of Neb’s shouts even appeared to produce an echo.Herbert directed Pencroft’s attention to it, adding, “That proves that there is a coast to the west, at no great distance.”The sailor nodded; besides, his eyes could not deceive him.If he had discovered land, however indistinct it might appear, land was sure to be there.But that distant echo was the only response produced by Neb’s shouts, while a heavy gloom hung over all the part east of the island."
"同时，天空也渐渐变得澄澈。将近午夜的时候，天空中的星星闪烁着光辉，如果工程师同他的伙伴们在一起，就会告诉他们那些星星不是北半球会有的。这里看不到北极星，星座也不是他们在美国经常见到的那些了，南十字星座在天空中闪耀着明亮的光辉。","Meanwhile, the sky was clearing little by little.Towards midnight the stars shone out, and if the engineer had been there with his companions he would have remarked that these stars did not belong to the Northern Hemisphere.The Polar Star was not visible, the constellations were not those which they had been accustomed to see in the United States; the Southern Cross glittered brightly in the sky."
"黑夜过去了。3月25日早上将近五点的时候，天空渐渐亮了起来，但地平线处还是一片黑暗。然而，随着黎明的到来，海上升起了浓雾，他们很难看清楚约20英尺以外的地方。最后，浓雾渐渐在波浪翻滚的海上弥散开来。","The night passed away.Towards five o’clock in the morning of the 25th of March, the sky began to lighten; the horizon still remained dark, but with daybreak a thick mist rose from the sea, so that the eye could scarcely penetrate beyond twenty feet or so from where they stood.At length the fog gradually unrolled itself in great heavily moving waves."
"但是不幸的是，这群落难者还是看不清楚周围的东西。当记者和纳布将注意力投向海面时，水手和赫伯特急切地向西面张望，希望在那里看到海岸。但是，依旧看不到一丁点陆地。“不要紧，”潘克洛夫说道，“虽然我看不到陆地，但是我感觉到……它在那里……那里……一定有陆地，就像我确信我们现在不在里士满一样。”雾气不久就停止上升了，这只是晴天的雾霭。不久，炙热的太阳就穿过小岛表面。大约六点半，也就是日出后三刻钟的时候，雾霭变得越来越稀薄。上层空气中的雾霭越来越厚，但是下面的雾气已经消散了。不久，小岛看起来就像从云中降下来的那样，周围的海面也显现了出来，向东面伸展开去，但是西面则被突起的、陡峭的海岸挡住了。","It was unfortunate, however, that the castaways could distinguish nothing around them.While the gaze of the reporter and Neb were cast upon the ocean, the sailor and Herbert looked eagerly for the coast in the west.But not a speck of land was visible.“Never mind,” said Pencroft, “though I do not see the land, I feel it...it is there...there...as sure as the fact that we are no longer at Richmond.”But the fog was not long in rising. it was only a fine-weather mist.A hot sun soon penetrated to the surface of the island.About half-past six, three-quarters of an hour after sunrise, the mist became more transparent.It grew thicker above, but cleared away below.Soon the isle appeared as if it had descended from a cloud, then the sea showed itself around them, spreading far away towards the east, but bounded on the west by an abrupt and precipitous coast."
"是的！陆地在那里。他们的安全至少暂时得到了保证。小岛和海岸被宽约半英里的海峡隔开了，海峡中奔涌着湍急的水流。","Yes! the land was there.Their safety was at least provisionally insured.The islet and the coast were separated by a channel about half a mile in breadth, through which rushed an extremely rapid current."
"但是，这群落难者中有一个人按捺不住心中的冲动，立即跳进了急流，甚至没有同他的伙伴们商量，也没有说一句话。那就是纳布。他急于到对面，向北爬过去。谁也没有办法使他回来。潘克洛夫也没能喊住他。记者准备跟着纳布过去，但是被潘克洛夫阻止了。“你想要穿过这个海峡吗？”他问道。“是的。”史佩莱回答道。“好吧！”水手说，“等一下，纳布一个人过去帮助他主人就足够了。如果我们冒险跳进海峡里，就有可能被水流冲进大海里去，水流现在正急，但是，如果我没猜错的话，现在是退潮。看，沙滩上的潮水退下去了。我们再忍耐一下，等到水位下降了，我们就可能找到一条趟过去的路了。”“你说得对，”记者回答道，“我们不能分开，这样才好互相照应。”","However, one of the castaways, following the impulse of his heart, immediately threw himself into the current, without consulting his companions, without saying a single word.It was Neb.He was in haste to be on the other side, and to climb towards the north.It had been impossible to hold him back.Pencroft called him in vain.The reporter prepared to follow him, but Pencroft stopped him.“Do you want to cross the channel?” he asked.“Yes,” replied Spilett.“All right!” said the seaman; “wait a bit; Neb is well able to carry help to his master.If we venture into the channel, we risk being carried into the open sea by the current, which is running very strong; but, if I’m not wrong, it is ebbing.See, the tide is going down over the sand.Let us have patience, and at low water it is possible we may find a fordable passage.”“You are right,” replied the reporter, “we will not separate more than we can help.”"
"与此同时，纳布正在与急流奋力抗争。他正斜着穿过海峡。他每划一次水，就能看到他黝黑的肩膀从水中显露出来。虽然水流快速地把他向下游冲去，但是他还是游向对岸。从小岛穿过海峡到对面的陆地用了半个多小时，他到达的海岸距对面的出发点有几百英尺远。","During this time Neb was struggling vigorously against the current.He was crossing in an oblique direction.His black shoulders could be seen emerging at each stroke.He was carried down very quickly, but he also made way towards the shore.It took more than half an hour to cross from the islet to the land, and he reached the shore several hundred feet from the place which was opposite to the point from which he had started."
"他在一块高大的花岗岩石壁下上了岸，用力抖了抖身上的水，然后就奔跑起来，不久就消失在岩石一角的后面了，这个岩石角与小岛北端的高度几乎持平。","Landing at the foot of a high wall of granite, he shook himself vigorously; and then, setting off running, soon disappeared behind a rocky point, which projected to nearly the height of the northern extremity of the islet."
"纳布的伙伴们十分担心，焦急地看着他这一大胆的举动。当他的身影消失之后，他们一边吃着沙滩上散布的贝类动物，一边将注意力集中到陆地上，那是他们的安全得到保证的希望。这些食物十分糟糕，但总比没有强。对面的海岸形成了一个巨大的海湾，南边被一个尖尖的海角阻断了，那里寸草不生，完全是一派荒凉的景象。这个海角与海岸毗邻，那里高大的花岗岩石形成了奇形怪状的轮廓。相反，越向北去，海湾就愈加宽阔，那边的海岸看起来更加曲折，从西南向东北延伸，形成了一个狭长的海岬。构成弓形海湾的两端相距约八英里。小岛距离海岸有半英里，有点像一条死去的巨型鲸鱼。最宽的地方也不过四分之一英里。","Neb’s companions had watched his daring attempt with painful anxiety, and when he was out of sight, they fixed their attention on the land where their hope of safety lay, while eating some shell-fish with which the sand was strewn.It was a wretched repast, but still it was better than nothing.The opposite coast formed one vast bay, terminating on the south by a very sharp point, which was destitute of all vegetation, and was of a very wild aspect.This point abutted on the shore in a grotesque outline of high granite rocks.Towards the north, on the contrary, the bay widened, and a more rounded coast appeared, trending from the southwest to the northeast, and terminating in a slender cape.The distance between these two extremities, which made the bow of the bay, was about eight miles.Half a mile from the shore rose the islet, which somewhat resembled the carcass of a gigantic whale.Its extreme breadth was not more than a quarter of a mile."
"小岛对面的海滩底层是沙子，海水渐渐退去，沙子上的黑石正一点一点地显露出来。沙子上层被垂直的花岗岩峭壁隔开，顶部高低不齐，至少有300英尺高。峭壁绵延了三英里，右边被突兀的悬崖阻断，悬崖看起来就像是人工凿开的一样。而左边，海角顶端的位置，奇形怪状、参差不齐的峭壁垂到地面，形成了一个长长的砾岩石坡，与南端的地面相接。海岸的高地上，一棵树也没有。高地十分平坦，像是好望角上的开普敦，只不过小一些而已，至少从小岛上看起来是这样。但是，悬崖的右边却是一片翠绿。他们可以轻易辨别出那是一片杂乱的树林，树木高耸，一望无际。他们的眼睛因看久了绵延的花岗石而疲劳不已，这片翠绿的树林使眼睛得到了放松。最后，在高地的远处，西北方向七英里开外，一座山峰在阳光下闪耀着。那是一座高山，山顶白雪皑皑。","Opposite the islet, the beach consisted first of sand, covered with black stones, which were now appearing little by little above the retreating tide.The second level was separated by a perpendicular granite cliff, terminated at the top by an unequal edge at a height of at least 300 feet.It continued thus for a length of three miles, ending suddenly on the right with a precipice which looked as if cut by the hand of man.On the left, above the promontory, this irregular and jagged cliff descended by a long slope of conglomerated rocks till it mingled with the ground of the southern point.On the upper plateau of the coast not a tree appeared.It was a flat tableland like that above Cape Town at the Cape of Good Hope, but of reduced proportions; at least so it appeared seen from the islet.However, verdure was not wanting to the right beyond the precipice.They could easily distinguish a confused mass of great trees, which extended beyond the limits of their view.This verdure relieved the eye, so long wearied by the continued ranges of granite.Lastly, beyond and above the plateau, in a northwesterly direction and at a distance of at least seven miles, glittered a white summit which reflected the sun’s rays.It was that of a lofty mountain, capped with snow."
"这块土地是一座孤岛，还是同大陆相连，目前还无法确定。但是如果地质学家看到左边震落的石堆，那么他们会毫不犹豫地指出那是由于火山爆发形成的，因为这些石块无疑是大地内部震动的产物。","The question could not at present be decided whether this land formed an island, or whether it belonged to a continent.But on beholding the convulsed masses heaped up on the left, no geologist would have hesitated to give them a volcanic origin, for they were unquestionably the work of subterranean convulsions."
"吉丁·史佩莱、潘克洛夫和赫伯特仔细查看了这块土地，他们可能要在这里生活许多年。假如这里远离船只的惯常航道，他们可能真的会死在这座岛上，事情很可能是这样。","Gideon Spilett, Pencroft, and Herbert attentively examined this land, on which they might perhaps have to live many long years; on which indeed they might even die, should it be out of the usual track of vessels, as was likely to be the case."
"“嗨，”赫伯特问道，“潘克洛夫，你怎么想？”","“Well,” asked Herbert, “what do you say, Pencroft?”"
"“跟其他事情一样，有好的一面，也有不好的一面。”水手回答道。“我们先看看再说。但现在明显是在退潮。三个小时之内，我们就能尝试这条通道，一到那边，我们就能试着摆脱困境了，希望能找到上尉。”潘克洛夫预料得没错。三个小时后，水位下降，海峡底部的大部分沙子都显露出来了。小岛与海岸之间只有一道窄窄的海峡，毫无疑问，他们可以轻松地过去。","“There is some good and some bad, as in everything,” replied the sailor.“We shall see.But now the ebb is evidently making.In three hours we will attempt the passage, and once on the other side, we will try to get out of this scrape, and I hope may find the captain.”Pencroft was not wrong in his anticipations.Three hours later at low tide, the greater part of the sand forming the bed of the channel was uncovered.Between the islet and the coast there only remained a narrow channel which would no doubt be easy to cross."
"大约十点钟的时候，吉丁·史佩莱和伙伴们把衣服脱掉，捆好顶在头上，然后就冒险跳进不足五英尺深的水中。对于赫伯特来说，水太深了，但他像条鱼一样，灵活地游过去了。他们三个都顺利到达了对岸。他们在涉水的时候避免衣服碰到水，很快，就在阳光下晒干了身子，穿上了衣服，然后坐下来一同商议下一步要怎么办。","About ten o’clock, Gideon Spilett and his companions stripped themselves of their clothes, which they placed in bundles on their heads, and then ventured into the water, which was not more than five feet deep.Herbert, for whom it was too deep, swam like a fish, and got through capitally.All three arrived without difficulty on the opposite shore.Quickly drying themselves in the sun, they put on their clothes, which they had preserved from contact with the water, and sat down to take counsel together what to do next."
"第四章","Chapter 4"
"突然，记者跳起身来，对水手说他会回来与他们在原地会合，然后便顺着黑人纳布几个小时前爬过的方向攀过悬崖。由于十分想知道朋友的下落，焦急之情加快了他的脚步，很快，他就绕过悬崖的拐角消失不见了。赫伯特想和他一起去。","All at once the reporter sprang up, and telling the sailor that he would rejoin them at that same place, he climbed the cliff in the direction which the Negro Neb had taken a few hours before.Anxiety hastened his steps, for he longed to obtain news of his friend, and he soon disappeared round an angle of the cliff.Herbert wished to accompany him."
"“孩子，你别去，”水手说，“我们要准备露营，还要找点比贝类更好吃的东西。他们回来时肯定想吃点东西。每个人都有自己的事要做。”","“Stop here, my boy,” said the sailor; “we have to prepare an encampment, and to try and find rather better grub than these shell-fish.Our friends will want something when they come back.There is work for everybody.”"
"“听你的吩咐。”赫伯特回答说。","“I am ready,” replied Herbert."
"“很好，”水手说，“这样才对嘛！现在我们要开始有秩序地干活了。我们又冷又累又饿，所以我们要找到住的地方、柴火和食物。森林里有木柴，鸟巢里有蛋，我们唯一要做的就是找住的地方。”","“All right,” said the sailor; “that will do.We must set about it regularly.We are tired, cold, and hungry; therefore we must have shelter, fire, and food.There is wood in the forest, and eggs in nests; we have only to find a house.”"
"“那行，”赫伯特回答说，“我将在岩石缝中找洞，我肯定能找到让我们容身的洞。”","“Very well,” returned Herbert, “I will look for a cave among the rocks, and I shall be sure to discover some hole into which we can creep.”"
"“那好，”潘克洛夫说，“去吧，孩子。”","“All right,” said Pencroft; “go on, my boy.”"
"他们走到海滩边的巨型岩石下，潮水已经退到很远的地方了，不过他们没有往北走，而是往南走。潘克洛夫注意到离着陆点几百英尺远的地方有一个狭窄的通道，也许那就是河流或溪水流出的地方。现在对他们来说，重要的是在河岸边安顿下来。另外，赛勒斯·哈丁有可能被激流冲到了岸边。","They both walked to the foot of the enormous wall over the beach, far from which the tide had now retreated; but instead of going towards the north, they went southward.Pencroft had remarked, several hundred feet from the place at which they landed, a narrow cutting, out of which he thought a river or stream might issue.Now, on the one hand it was important to settle themselves in the neighborhood of a good stream of water, and on the other it was possible that the current had thrown Cyrus Harding on the shore there."
"之前已经说过，悬崖高达300英尺，不过整个悬崖都很完整，即便是最底部也很少受到海水的冲刷，所以连作为容身之所的小小缝隙都没有。这是座坚硬的花岗岩墙，就连海浪都不曾磨损它。一群群海鸟围着山顶飞来飞去，尤其是那些蹼足鸟类，它们的嘴又扁又长，并且向外突出，还叫个不停。也许这是人类第一次侵犯它们的领地，看到人它们一点也不害怕。潘克洛夫认出了贼鸥，其中还有许多贪吃的小海鸥，它们都躲在花岗岩的裂缝里。只要开一枪，就能打死很多海鸥，不过前提是要有一把枪，可是潘克洛夫和赫伯特都没有。况且，小海鸥和其他海鸥几乎不能吃，海鸥蛋的味道也不怎样。但是，赫伯特向左挪了几步，突然之间他碰到了长满海草的岩石，几个小时后它们就会被潮水掩盖。在石头上，滑溜溜的海草里藏满了贝类，饿着肚子的人是不会放过它们的。赫伯特喊了潘克洛夫，他就马上过来了。","The cliff, as has been said, rose to a height of three hundred feet, but the mass was unbroken throughout, and even at its base, scarcely washed by the sea, it did not offer the smallest fissure which would serve as a dwelling.It was a perpendicular wall of very hard granite, which even the waves had not worn away.Towards the summit fluttered myriads of sea-fowl, and especially those of the web-footed species with long, flat, pointed beaks—a clamorous tribe, bold in the presence of man, who probably for the first time thus invaded their domains.Pencroft recognized the skua and other gulls among them, the voracious little sea-mew, which in great numbers nestled in the crevices of the granite.A shot fired among this swarm would have killed a great number, but to fire a shot a gun was needed, and neither Pencroft nor Herbert had one; besides this, gulls and sea-mews are scarcely eatable, and even their eggs have a detestable taste.However, Herbert, who had gone forward a little more to the left, soon came upon rocks covered with sea-weed, which, some hours later, would be hidden by the high tide.On these rocks, in the midst of slippery wrack, abounded bivalve shell-fish, not to be despised by starving people.Herbert called Pencroft, who ran up hastily."
"“这都是贻贝！”水手喊道，“没有鸟蛋，这些也可以充饥呀！”","“Here are mussels!” cried the sailor; “these will do instead of eggs!”"
"“这不是贻贝，”赫伯特答道，他一边仔细检查岩石上的软体动物一边说，“是茨蟹。”","“They are not mussels,” replied Herbert, who was attentively examining the molluscs attached to the rocks; “they are lithodomes.”"
"“好吃吗？”潘克洛夫问道。","“Are they good to eat?” asked Pencroft."
"“非常好吃。”","“Perfectly so.”"
"“那我们就吃点茨蟹。”","“Then let us eat some lithodomes.”"
"水手完全可以相信赫伯特的话，这位少年不仅对博物学特别了解，还很热爱这门科学。他爸爸曾经鼓励他在这方面多多学习，还让他旁听波士顿知名教授的讲座，这些人都非常喜欢这个聪明勤奋的小伙子。渐渐地，他对博物学的了解不止一次给了他很大的帮助，这回也不例外。这些茨蟹有椭圆形的贝壳，它们成群地粘在岩石上，十分牢固。它们属于穿孔类软体动物，即便是最坚硬的石头，它们也能在里面打洞。这些软体动物的壳两端浑圆，这在普通的贻贝中是不多见的。","The sailor could rely upon Herbert; the young boy was well up in natural history, and always had had quite a passion for the science.His father had encouraged him in it, by letting him attend the lectures of the best professors in Boston, who were very fond of the intelligent, industrious lad.And his turn for natural history was, more than once in the course of time, of great use, and he was not mistaken in this instance.These lithodomes were oblong shells, suspended in clusters and adhering very tightly to the rocks.They belong to that species of molluscous perforators which excavate holes in the hardest stone; their shell is rounded at both ends, a feature which is not remarked in the common mussel."
"这些茨蟹在阳光中半开着壳，成了潘克洛夫和赫伯特的一顿美餐。不过，他们是拿这些茨蟹当牡蛎来吃的，这种蟹本身就带有很重的辣味，所以不用任何调料，吃起来就很可口。","Pencroft and Herbert made a good meal of the lithodomes, which were then half opened to the sun.They ate them as oysters, and as they had a strong peppery taste, they were palatable without condiments of any sort."
"这样一来，他们的饥饿感也不那么强烈了，但是口渴的程度却有增无减，特别是在吃过这些“天然香辣”的软体动物之后。他们必须要找点干净的水喝，在这样一个气候多变、地形崎岖的地方，找不到水的可能性并不大。潘克洛夫和赫伯特打算备足吃的，他们在口袋和手帕里装满了茨蟹，接着就启程返回了悬崖下面。","Their hunger was thus appeased for the time, but not their thirst, which increased after eating these naturally-spiced molluscs.They had then to find fresh water, and it was not likely that it would be wanting in such a capriciously uneven region.Pencroft and Herbert, after having taken the precaution of collecting an ample supply of lithodomes, with which they filled their pockets and handkerchiefs, regained the foot of the cliff."
"走了两百多步后，他们来到了裂缝旁，果然如潘克洛夫猜想的那样，裂缝里流出了一条小溪，只不过溪水是不是淡水还不清楚。在这里，岩石墙似乎被某种猛烈的地下作用力给分隔开来了。岩石底部由于一条小溪凹陷进去，溪水的尽头形成了很急的弯道。这条水路在那一段只有一百英尺宽，两岸的高度也不到20英尺。溪水在两座花岗岩墙之间变得非常凶猛，近乎笔直地流淌，而一到河口水流就平缓下来了，接着溪水突然拐了一个弯，消失在大约半英里外的矮树林中。","Two hundred paces farther they arrived at the cutting, through which, as Pencroft had guessed, ran a stream of water, whether fresh or not was to be ascertained.At this place the wall appeared to have been separated by some violent subterranean force.At its base was hollowed out a little creek, the farthest part of which formed a tolerably sharp angle.The watercourse at that part measured one hundred feet in breadth, and its two banks on each side were scarcely twenty feet high.The river became strong almost directly between the two walls of granite, which began to sink above the mouth; it then suddenly turned and disappeared beneath a wood of stunted trees half a mile off."
"“这里有水，那边有我们要的木柴！”潘克洛夫喊道，“太好了，赫伯特，现在我们只需要找个住的地方了。”","“Here is the water, and yonder is the wood we require!” said Pencroft.“Well, Herbert, now we only want the house.”"
"溪水清澈见底。水手确定此时此刻是低潮，也就是涨潮没有来临的时候，溪水还是可以饮用的。确信这重要的一点之后，赫伯特就开始寻找作为容身之所的洞穴，但是徒劳无功，因为整座岩石墙都很光滑、平坦，而且是垂直于地面的。","The water of the river was limpid.The sailor ascertained that at this time—that is to say, at low tide, when the rising floods did not reach it—it was sweet.This important point established, Herbert looked for some cavity which would serve them as a retreat, but in vain; everywhere the wall appeared smooth, plain, and perpendicular."
"不过，在河口涨潮也不会淹到的地方，自然的震动形成的不是一个洞穴，而是一堆巨型石头，这在花岗岩丰富的国家十分常见，人们把它们叫做“石窟”。","However, at the mouth of the watercourse and above the reach of the high tide, the convulsions of nature had formed, not a grotto, but a pile of enormous rocks, such as are often met with in granite countries and which bear the name of “Chimneys.”"
"潘克洛夫和赫伯特进入了岩石深处，沿着沙子小路走着，这里有光线，它从岩石留有的孔里射进来，有的岩石奇迹般地保持着平衡。伴随阳光进来的还有一股风——经常吹的穿堂风，带来了外面的寒气。不过，水手想要是把石头和沙子混在一起填上一些空当，这些“石窟”就能住人了。他们的几何计划将这里改造成类似于“＆”（也就是拉丁文“和”的缩写）这个符号的结构，只不过要分开符号上面贯通强劲的西风和南风的口，这样他们就能利用下面的部分了。","Pencroft and Herbert penetrated quite far in among the rocks, by sandy passages in which light was not wanting, for it entered through the openings which were left between the blocks, of which some were only sustained by a miracle of equilibrium; but with the light came also air—a regular corridor-gale—and with the wind the sharp cold from the exterior.However, the sailor thought that by stopping-up some of the openings with a mixture of stones and sand, the Chimneys could be rendered habitable.Their geometrical plan represented the typographical sign “&,” which signifies “et cetera” abridged, but by isolating the upper mouth of the sign, through which the south and west winds blew so strongly, they could succeed in making the lower part of use."
"“这就是我们的工作，”潘克洛夫说，“如果我们能再看到哈丁上尉，他会知道怎么改造这座迷宫。”","“Here’s our work,” said Pencroft, “and if we ever see Captain Harding again, he will know how to make something of this labyrinth.”"
"“我们肯定会再见到他的，潘克洛夫先生，”赫伯特喊道，“他回来的时候一定会看到一个舒服的窝。我们在左边的通道弄个壁炉，然后留个出烟的通风口，这样就可以了。”","“We shall see him again, Pencroft,” cried Herbert, “and when be returns he must find a tolerable dwelling here.It will be so, if we can make a fireplace in the left passage and keep an opening for the smoke.”"
"“孩子，我们可以做到，”水手说，“这些石窟也够我们用的了。我们开始干活吧，不过得先找点木柴。我想树枝可以很好地挡住这些口，寒风从这些口吹过的尖声跟无数鬼一样。”","“So we can, my boy,” replied the sailor, “and these Chimneys will serve our turn.Let us set to work, but first come and get a store of fuel.I think some branches will be very useful in stopping up these openings, through which the wind shrieks like so many fiends.”"
"赫伯特和潘克洛夫离开了石窟，越过了拐角，然后开始爬上左边的河岸。这里的水流十分湍急，枯木漂在水面上。高涨的潮水已经可以明显地看到了，这块木头很可能会被潮水用力地冲到很远的地方。然后，水手想到他们可以利用这次退潮运送重物。","Herbert and Pencroft left the Chimneys, and, turning the angle, they began to climb the left bank of the river.The current here was quite rapid, and drifted down some dead wood.The rising tide—and it could already be perceived—must drive it back with force to a considerable distance.The sailor then thought that they could utilize this ebb and flow for the transport of heavy objects."
"走了一刻钟后，水手和男孩来到了河水向左拐的弯道口。河水从这里继续向前流淌，沿途是一片参天大树。虽然已近深秋，这些树仍然郁郁葱葱，因为它们属于“松柏科”，遍布全球各地，北部气候区到热带都有这种树。这位年轻的博物学家认出了其中的“喜马拉雅杉”，这些杉树在喜马拉雅山地带十分常见，它们周围散发出十分宜人的香气。这些好看的树木中间还伸出一丛丛冷杉树，它们不透明的大树枝像伞一样朝四周延展开来。经过长长的草地时，潘克洛夫感觉到脚下踩碎了的干树枝发出像鞭炮一样的噼啪声。","After having walked for a quarter of an hour, the sailor and the boy arrived at the angle which the river made in turning towards the left.From this point its course was pursued through a forest of magnificent trees.These trees still retained their verdure, notwithstanding the advanced season, for they belonged to the family of “coniferae,” which is spread over all the regions of the globe, from northern climates to the tropics.The young naturalist recognized especially the “deedara,” which are very numerous in the Himalayan zone, and which spread around them a most agreeable odor.Between these beautiful trees sprang up clusters of firs, whose opaque open parasol boughs spread wide around.Among the long grass, Pencroft felt that his feet were crushing dry branches which crackled like fireworks."
"“孩子，”潘克洛夫对赫伯特说，“如果我不知道这些树的名字，我认为至少可以把它们叫做‘燃木’，眼下我们最需要的就是它了。”","“Well, my boy,” said he to Herbert, “if I don’t know the name of these trees, at any rate I reckon that we may call them ‘burning wood,’ and just now that’s the chief thing we want.”"
"“那我们备一些吧！”赫伯特答道，说完立马开始动手。","“Let us get a supply,” replied Herbert, who immediately set to work."
"他们很容易就集到了足够的木柴。他们都没必要到树上去折，因为脚边就有大量的枯木。不过即便木柴有了，如何运送它们还是一个问题。这些木柴很干，很快就能烧起来，所以有必要把大量的木柴运到石窟，可是两个人的负荷量是不够的。赫伯特注意到了这个问题。","The collection was easily made.It was not even necessary to lop the trees, for enormous quantities of dead wood were lying at their feet; but if fuel was not wanting, the means of transporting it was not yet found.The wood, being very dry, would burn rapidly; it was therefore necessary to carry to the Chimneys a considerable quantity, and the loads of two men would not be sufficient.Herbert remarked this."
"“孩子，”水手说，“一定有办法运这些木柴，做任何事总有解决方法的。要是我们有辆手推车或一艘船就好办多了。”","“Well, my boy,” replied the sailor, “there must be some way of carrying this wood; there is always a way of doing everything.If we had a cart or a boat, it would be easy enough.”"
"“可我们有这条河啊。”赫伯特说。","“But we have the river,” said Herbert."
"“你说得对，”潘克洛夫回答说，“这条河对我们来说就像运输线，它可以帮我们运木柴，木筏造出来不是一无是处的。”","“Right,” replied Pencroft; “the river will be to us like a road which carries of itself, and rafts have not been invented for nothing.”"
"“只不过，”赫伯特说，“现在这条路的方向可不对，正涨潮呢！”","“Only,” observed Herbert, “at this moment our road is going the wrong way, for the tide is rising!”"
"“我们等到退潮就好了，”水手回答说，“到时候我们就可以利用它把燃料带到石窟那儿了。我们先把木筏准备好吧。”","“We shall be all right if we wait till it ebbs,” replied the sailor, “and then we will trust it to carry our fuel to the Chimneys.Let us get the raft ready.”"
"水手朝河的方向走过去，后边跟着赫伯特。他们都各尽所能将成捆的木柴运过去。他们还在岸边的草丛里发现了许多枯树枝，兴许这里从来都没有人类踏足过。潘克洛夫马上开始做木筏。河岸的一角阻断水流形成了一个小湾，水手和少年在这里放好了一些大小合适的木头，然后用蔓藤把它们捆在了一起。木筏很快就做好了，上面堆满了他们收集到的所有木柴，这些木柴至少要20个人才能搬完。一个小时后他们就干完了所有的活，然后把木筏停在岸边，等着退潮。","The sailor, followed by Herbert, directed his steps towards the river.They both carried, each in proportion to his strength, a load of wood bound in fagots.They found on the bank also a great quantity of dead branches in the midst of grass, among which the foot of man had probably never before trod.Pencroft began directly to make his raft.In a kind of little bay, created by a point of the shore which broke the current, the sailor and the lad placed some good-sized pieces of wood, which they had fastened together with dry creepers.A raft was thus formed, on which they stacked all they had collected, sufficient, indeed, to have loaded at least twenty men.In an hour the work was finished, and the raft moored to the bank, awaited the turning of the tide."
"离退潮还有几个小时，潘克洛夫和赫伯特达成一致决定上高处呆着，这样就能将周围地势收入眼底。","There were still several hours to be occupied, and with one consent Pencroft and Herbert resolved to gain the upper plateau, so as to have a more extended view of the surrounding country."
"离河流拐角两百英尺远的地方是岩石墙，被下落的岩石挡住，渐渐成了缓坡，延伸至树林的边缘。这是一座天然的阶梯。赫伯特和水手开始往上爬，他们肌肉的力量很强大，没用几分钟就爬到了山顶，继而到达了河口的上方。","Exactly two hundred feet behind the angle formed by the river, the wall, terminated by a fall of rocks, died away in a gentle slope to the edge of the forest.It was a natural staircase.Herbert and the sailor began their ascent; thanks to the vigor of their muscles they reached the summit in a few minutes; and proceeded to the point above the mouth of the river."
"一到山顶他们就将目光投在海上，他们不久前还十分艰难地横渡那片海。他们激动地发现，整个北部海岸就是灾难发生的地方。就是在那里，赛勒斯·哈丁失踪了。他们想看看是不是能找到气球的残留部分，也许会有一个人还抓着它。但什么都没有！大海就是一望无际的荒凉水域。海岸上也没有一个人影。到处都看不到记者，也看不到纳布。但也有可能他们此时离得太远，一时看不见而已。","On attaining it, their first look was cast upon the ocean which not long before they had traversed in such a terrible condition.They observed, with emotion, all that part to the north of the coast on which the catastrophe had taken place.It was there that Cyrus Harding had disappeared.They looked to see if some portion of their balloon, to which a man might possibly cling, yet existed.Nothing!The sea was but one vast watery desert.As to the coast, it was solitary also.Neither the reporter nor Neb could be anywhere seen.But it was possible that at this time they were both too far away to be perceived."
"“我有种感觉，”赫伯特喊道，“像哈丁上尉这样健壮的人，是不会像其他人那样让自己溺水身亡的。他肯定是到了岸上的某个地方，你不这样认为吗，潘克洛夫先生？”","“Something tells me,” cried Herbert, “that a man as energetic as Captain Harding would not let himself be drowned like other people.He must have reached some point of the shore; don’t you think so, Pencroft?”"
"水手悲伤地摇了摇头。他几乎不抱希望再次见到赛勒斯·哈丁，但还是想给赫伯特留一线希望，“肯定的，肯定的，”他说，“即便世上所有人都屈服了，我们这位工程师也会走出困境的。”","The sailor shook his head sadly.He little expected ever to see Cyrus Harding again; but wishing to leave some hope to Herbert: “Doubtless, doubtless,” said he; “our engineer is a man who would get out of a scrape to which any one else would yield.”"
"他一边说一边仔细地观察整片海岸。他们脚下延伸的是一片沙滩，一直到河口的右边就被一排排浪花挡住了。冒出来的岩石看上去就像在海浪里休息的两栖怪物。礁石那边，大海在阳光下闪闪发亮。南边突起的一块地方阻断了地平线前方的视线，大陆是不是朝那个方向延伸还看不太清楚，而如果它朝东南或西南方向延伸，那整个海岸就会变成一座长长的半岛了。在海湾最北端，海岸的轮廓延伸至远处，形成更宽的弧线。那部分海岸又低又平，旁边没有悬崖，只有潮水波及不到的巨大沙滩。潘克洛夫和赫伯特又向西行进。这时，他们的注意力第一次被六、七英里外顶部白雪皑皑的高山吸引住了。从山坡开始下斜到离海岸两英里以内的地方都是成片的树林，常青树形成的大片绿色给树林增加了别样的魅力。树林的边缘与海岸之间有块平原，一片片树丛稀稀疏疏、不规则地分布着。左边的林间空地有小河的水流流过，在阳光下闪闪发光。他们能沿着山的支脉追溯它弯曲的路线，似乎在那中间就是河流的发源地。水手放木筏的地方就是两座花岗岩石墙矗立的地方，不过如果说左岸的岩石还算清晰、陡峭的话，那右岸的岩石墙就完全相反，它缓慢下沉，刚开始还是一面巨型石墙，渐渐地变成了孤立的岩石，岩石变成了石头，最后石头变成卵石，直到终点。","In the meantime he examined the coast with great attention.Stretched out below them was the sandy shore, bounded on the right of the river’s mouth by lines of breakers.The rocks which were visible appeared like amphibious monsters reposing in the surf.Beyond the reef, the sea sparkled beneath the sun’s rays.To the south a sharp point closed the horizon, and it could not be seen if the land was prolonged in that direction, or if it ran southeast and southwest, which would have made this coast a very long peninsula.At the northern extremity of the bay the outline of the shore was continued to a great distance in a wider curve.There the shore was low, flat, without cliffs, and with great banks of sand, which the tide left uncovered.Pencroft and Herbert then returned towards the west.Their attention was first arrested by the snow-topped mountain which rose at a distance of six or seven miles.From its first declivities to within two miles of the coast were spread vast masses of wood, relieved by large green patches, caused by the presence of evergreen trees.Then, from the edge of this forest to the shore extended a plain, scattered irregularly with groups of trees.Here and there on the left sparkled through glades the waters of the little river; they could trace its winding course back towards the spurs of the mountain, among which it seemed to spring.At the point where the sailor had left his raft of wood, it began to run between the two high granite walls; but if on the left bank the wall remained clear and abrupt, on the right bank, on the contrary, it sank gradually, the massive sides changed to isolated rocks, the rocks to stones, the stones to shingle running to the extremity of the point."
"“我们是不是在一个岛上啊？”水手低语道。","“Are we on an island?” murmured the sailor."
"“不管怎么说，这个地方似乎够大。”小伙子回答说。","“At any rate, it seems to be big enough,” replied the lad."
"“岛屿再大它还是岛啊！”潘克洛夫说。","“An island, ever so big, is an island all the same!” said Pencroft."
"不过这个重要的问题还不能回答。只有作更全面的调查才能解决这个问题。至于这个陆地本身——称作岛也好，称作洲也好——看上去十分肥沃，从各个方面来说，这里条件都很不错，物产也比较丰富。","But this important question could not yet be answered.A more perfect survey had to be made to settle the point.As to the land itself, island or continent, it appeared fertile, agreeable in its aspect, and varied in its productions."
"“这里真令人满意，”潘克洛夫评论道，“我们应该感谢上天在我们身处不幸时对我们的眷顾。”","“This is satisfactory,” observed Pencroft; “and in our misfortune, we must thank Providence for it.”"
"“谢天谢地！”赫伯特回应道，他虔诚的心充满了对造物主的感激之情。","“God be praised!” responded Herbert, whose pious heart was full of gratitude to the Author of all things."
"潘克洛夫和赫伯特仔细地看了看他们落脚的这个地方，不过，通过这样仓促的观察来预测他们的未来，难度很大。","Pencroft and Herbert examined for some time the country on which they had been cast; but it was difficult to guess after so hasty an inspection what the future had in store for them."
"他们开始沿着花岗岩石墙面的南端返回，长长的边缘是参差不齐的岩石，都奇形怪状的。几百只鸟住在石洞里，赫伯特一跳上岩石就吓着了这群长着翅膀的小家伙。","They then returned, following the southern crest of the granite platform, bordered by a long fringe of jagged rocks, of the most whimsical shapes.Some hundreds of birds lived there nestled in the holes of the stone; Herbert, jumping over the rocks, startled a whole flock of these winged creatures."
"“啊！”他叫起来了，“这些鸟不是沙鸥，也不是海鸥！”","“Oh!” cried he, “those are not gulls nor sea-mews!”"
"“那它们是什么？”潘克洛夫问道。","“What are they then?” asked Pencroft."
"“依我看，可能是鸽子！”","“Upon my word, one would say they were pigeons!”"
"“应该是，不过它们兴许是野鸽子或山鸽子。我认得这种鸟，它们翅膀上有两条黑带，尾巴是白色的，而羽毛则是青灰色的。要是山鸽子肉好吃的话，那它的蛋肯定也不错，我们快看看它们的窝里有多少蛋！”","“Just so, but these are wild or rock pigeons.I recognize them by the double band of black on the wing, by the white tail, and by their slate-colored plumage.But if the rock-pigeon is good to eat, its eggs must be excellent, and we will soon see how many they may have left in their nests!”"
"“我们不给它们时间来孵蛋了，除非它们孵出来的是荷包蛋的形状！”潘克洛夫高兴地回答道。","“We will not give them time to hatch, unless it is in the shape of an omelet!” replied Pencroft merrily."
"“但是你要用什么煎荷包蛋呢？”赫伯特问道，“在你的帽子里？”","“But what will you make your omelet in?” asked Herbert; “in your hat?”"
"“好啦！”水手说，“我可不会变戏法，孩子，我们必须下到洞里去拿蛋，我就搞定那些最难的吧！”","“Well!” replied the sailor, “I am not quite conjuror enough for that; we must come down to eggs in the shell, my boy, and I will undertake to despatch the hardest!”"
"潘克洛夫和赫伯特非常认真地查看花岗岩的石洞，他们真的在其中一些洞穴里发现了鸽子蛋。他们捡了十几个蛋放进水手的手帕里，这时满潮就要来临，潘克洛夫和赫伯特又从岩石上下来，朝河流走去。他们到那里时，已经是正午后的一小时了。这时，潮水已经退了。他们要利用退潮的机会把木柴运到河口处。潘克洛夫不会听任木筏没有向导在水流中走，也没有想过要登上木筏亲自掌控方向。即便没有缆绳或绳索，这也不会难倒身为水手的潘克洛夫，不一会儿，他就用干蔓藤拧成了几英寻长的绳索。水手将这条蔓藤绳系在了木筏的尾部，一只手抓着绳子，而赫伯特则用一根长长的木杆将木筏推到水流中。一切都成功完成了。满载木柴的木筏顺着水流漂下去。沿岸地势没有起伏，所以他们不用担心木筏会搁浅。不到两点，他们就到达了离石窟几步远的河口。","Pencroft and Herbert attentively examined the cavities in the granite, and they really found eggs in some of the hollows.A few dozen being collected, were packed in the sailor’s handkerchief, and as the time when the tide would be full was approaching, Pencroft and Herbert began to redescend towards the watercourse.When they arrived there, it was an hour after midday.The tide had already turned.They must now avail themselves of the ebb to take the wood to the mouth.Pencroft did not intend to let the raft go away in the current without guidance, neither did he mean to embark on it himself to steer it.But a sailor is never at a loss when there is a question of cables or ropes, and Pencroft rapidly twisted a cord, a few fathoms long, made of dry creepers.This vegetable cable was fastened to the after-part of the raft, and the sailor held it in his hand while Herbert, pushing off the raft with a long pole, kept it in the current.This succeeded capitally.The enormous load of wood drifted down the current.The bank was very equal; there was no fear that the raft would run aground, and before two o’clock they arrived at the river’s mouth, a few paces from the Chimneys."
"第五章","Chapter 5"
"潘克洛夫从木筏上卸下干柴后，第一件事便是把所有灌风的洞口都堵上，使山洞适宜居住。他用沙子、石头、弯曲的树枝和湿粘土堵住了南风的通道口。旁边只留下一道狭窄弯曲的口子，用以通烟、引火。这个山洞就这样被分成了三四个房间（如果称得上房间的话），恐怕连驴子都不愿住在里面。但里边比较干燥，至少位于中央的主屋有足够直起身子的空间。他们在地上铺了细沙，一切安排妥当后，他们非常满意，因为没有比这里更好的地方了。","Pencroft’s first care, after unloading the raft, was to render the cave habitable by stopping up all the holes which made it draughty.Sand, stones, twisted branches, wet clay, closed up the galleries open to the south winds.One narrow and winding opening at the side was kept, to lead out the smoke and to make the fire draw.The cave was thus divided into three or four rooms, if such dark dens with which a donkey would scarcely have been contented deserved the name.But they were dry, and there was space to stand upright, at least in the principal room, which occupied the center.The floor was covered with fine sand, and taking all in all they were well pleased with it for want of a better."
"“兴许，”赫伯特一边和潘克洛夫干着活，一边说，“我们的伙伴已经找到更好的地方了呢。”","“Perhaps,” said Herbert, while he and Pencroft were working, “our companions have found a superior place to ours.”"
"“很有可能，”水手回答说，“但是，既然我们现在还不知道，就必须照常工作。未雨绸缪总是好的！”","“Very likely,” replied the seaman; “but, as we don’t know, we must work all the same.Better to have two strings to one’s bow than no string at all!”"
"“噢！”赫伯特感叹道，“要是他们能够找到哈丁上尉，并把他带回来该有多好啊！”","“Oh!” exclaimed Herbert, “how jolly it will be if they were to find Captain Harding and were to bring him back with them!”"
"“是啊，确实如此！”潘克洛夫说，“要是他还活着，就真算个了不起的人。”","“Yes, indeed!” said Pencroft, “that was a man of the right sort.”"
"“活着！”赫伯特大声说，“难道你已经绝望地认为再也见不到他了吗？”","“Was!” exclaimed Herbert, “do you despair of ever seeing him again?”"
"“但愿不会如此！”水手答道。他们很快干完了活，潘克洛夫对自己十分满意。","“God forbid!” replied the sailor.Their work was soon done, and Pencroft declared himself very well satisfied."
"“现在，”他说，“我们的朋友随时都可以回来。他们有一个很好的安身之所了。”","“Now,” said he, “our friends can come back when they like.They will find a good enough shelter.”"
"现在他们只需造个壁炉，准备一顿晚饭，这是件轻而易举的小事。他们在保留下来的狭窄洞口放置了几块大的平板石。只要烟不把里面的热气带出去，这就足够使洞内保持适当的温度。他们把木柴储存在其中的一间屋子，水手在壁炉旁放了一些木柴和树枝。水手正忙着的时候，赫伯特问他有没有火柴。","They now had only to make a fireplace and to prepare the supper—an easy task.Large flat stones were placed on the ground at the opening of the narrow passage which had been kept.This, if the smoke did not take the heat out with it, would be enough to maintain an equal temperature inside.Their wood was stowed away in one of the rooms, and the sailor laid in the fireplace some logs and brushwood.The seaman was busy with this, when Herbert asked him if he had any matches."
"“当然有，”潘克洛夫回答说，“我可以很高兴地说，如果没有火柴或者火绒，我们就会陷入困境。”","“Certainly,” replied Pencroft, “and I may say happily, for without matches or tinder we should be in a fix.”"
"“我们还可以像野人那样取火，”赫伯特说，“就是拿两根干木棒互相摩擦。”","“Still we might get fire as the savages do,” replied Herbert, “by rubbing two bits of dry stick one against the other.”"
"“好，你试试吧，孩子！除了能活动一下你的胳膊外，看能做成什么事。”","“All right; try, my boy, and let’s see if you can do anything besides exercising your arms.”"
"“哼，这个太简单了，太平洋岛屿上的人就经常用这种方法。”","“Well, it’s a very simple proceeding, and much used in the islands of the Pacific.”"
"“这一点我不否认，”潘克洛夫回答说，“但是野人应该知道怎么做或者使用了什么特殊的木头，因为我曾经好几次尝试过这种方法，却从没有成功。我不得不说还是火柴好用些。哎呀，我的火柴呢？”","“I don’t deny it,” replied Pencroft, “but the savages must know how to do it or employ a peculiar wood, for more than once I have tried to get fire in that way, but I could never manage it.I must say I prefer matches.By the bye, where are my matches?”"
"潘克洛夫伸手去坎肩口袋里找火柴盒，他是个老烟枪，平时总把它放在那里。他没有找到，他翻遍了裤子的口袋，但令他吃惊的是，找不到火柴盒。","Pencroft searched in his waistcoat for the box, which was always there, for he was a confirmed smoker.He could not find it; he rummaged the pockets of his trousers, but, to his horror, he could nowhere discover the box."
"“糟糕！”他看着赫伯特说，“火柴盒一定是从口袋掉出来，弄丢了！赫伯特，想必你一定有火绒盒之类的生火用具吧？”","“Here’s a go!” said he, looking at Herbert.“The box must have fallen out of my pocket and got lost!Surely, Herbert, you must have something—a tinder-box—anything that can possibly make fire!”"
"“我没有，潘克洛夫。”","“No, I haven’t, Pencroft.”"
"水手冲了出去，孩子跟在后边。他们在沙滩上、岩石缝里和河岸附近仔细寻找，但都没有找到。火柴盒是铜制的，应该很容易看到。","The sailor rushed out, followed by the boy.On the sand, among the rocks, near the river’s bank, they both searched carefully, but in vain.The box was of copper, and therefore would have been easily seen."
"“潘克洛夫，”赫伯特问，“你没有把它从吊篮里扔出去吗？”","“Pencroft,” asked Herbert, “didn’t you throw it out of the car?”"
"“我记得很清楚，没有丢，”水手回答说，“但是这么个小东西很容易在我们经历的颠簸中丢失的。我倒宁愿丢掉的是烟斗。该死的火柴盒！它哪儿去了呢？","“I knew better than that,” replied the sailor; “but such a small article could easily disappear in the tumbling about we have gone through.I would rather even have lost my pipe!Confound the box!Where can it be?”"
"“瞧，现在退潮了，”赫伯特说，“跑到我们着陆的地方看看吧。”","“Look here, the tide is going down,” said Herbert; “let’s run to the place where we landed.”"
"要找到火柴盒几乎是不可能的，涨潮的时候，海浪把沙滩上的鹅卵石都冲过了，不过试一下也好。赫伯特和潘克洛夫快速走到昨天着陆的地点，这里离山洞大约两百英尺远。他们在鹅卵石堆里和岩石缝隙中搜寻，但是什么也没有找到。如果火柴盒丢在这个地方，那么一定被海浪冲走了。退潮后，他们搜寻了每一个狭小的裂缝，但仍一无所获。按照他们当时的情况来说，这真是巨大、无法弥补的损失。潘克洛夫无法隐藏自己的苦恼，他看起来很着急，但是一句话也没说。赫伯特尽量安慰他说，即使找到火柴，也很可能被海水浸湿，不能用了。","It was scarcely probable that they would find the box, which the waves had rolled about among the pebbles, at high tide, but it was as well to try.Herbert and Pencroft walked rapidly to the point where they had landed the day before, about two hundred feet from the cave.They hunted there, among the shingle, in the clefts of the rocks, but found nothing.If the box had fallen at this place it must have been swept away by the waves.As the sea went down, they searched every little crevice with no result.It was a grave loss in their circumstances, and for the time irreparable.Pencroft could not hide his vexation; he looked very anxious, but said not a word.Herbert tried to console him by observing, that if they had found the matches, they would, very likely, have been wetted by the sea and useless."
"“不可能，孩子，”水手说，“火柴是装在盖得严实的铜盒子里，现在我们该怎么办？”","“No, my boy,” replied the sailor; “they were in a copper box which shut very tightly; and now what are we to do?”"
"“我们一定会找到生火的办法！”赫伯特说，“哈丁船上尉或者史佩莱先生身上不会没有火柴的。”","“We shall certainly find some way of making a fire,” said Herbert.“Captain Harding or Mr. Spilett will not be without them.”"
"“有道理，”潘克洛夫回答说，“可是现在没有火，我们的伙伴回来也就吃不上像样的东西了。”","“Yes,” replied Pencroft; “but in the meantime we are without fire, and our companions will find but a sorry repast on their return.”"
"“可是，”赫伯特很快说道，“你认为他们会不会也没有火绒或火柴啊？”","“But,” said Herbert quickly, “do you think it possible that they have no tinder or matches?”"
"“我看不一定有，”水手边摇头边回答说，“因为纳布和哈丁上尉都不吸烟。至于史佩莱先生，我认为相比火柴盒他更情愿留下笔记本。”","“I doubt it,” replied the sailor, shaking his head, “for neither Neb nor Captain Harding smoke, and I believe that Mr. Spilett would rather keep his note-book than his match-box.”"
"赫伯特没有回答。弄丢火柴盒的确让人感到可惜，但是这个孩子仍然相信能用其他方法来生火。经验更为丰富的潘克洛夫从不会因为或多或少的不满而自寻烦恼，但这次他却没那么乐观了。不管怎样，他们只有一件事情可做——等待纳布和通讯记者回来。但是，他们必须放弃原本准备好吃熟蛋的计划。不论对他们自己还是对其他人来说，生吞活咽不是一件愉悦的事情。","Herbert did not reply.The loss of the box was certainly to be regretted, but the boy was still sure of procuring fire in some way or other.Pencroft, more experienced, did not think so, although he was not a man to trouble himself about a small or great grievance.At any rate, there was only one thing to be done—to await the return of Neb and the reporter; but they must give up the feast of hard eggs which they had meant to prepare, and a meal of raw flesh was not an agreeable prospect either for themselves or for the others."
"火是肯定无法找到了，在回洞前，水手和赫伯特捡了一些牡蛎，然后静静地沿着原路返回了他们的住所。","Before returning to the cave, the sailor and Herbert, in the event of fire being positively unattainable, collected some more shell-fish, and then silently retraced their steps to their dwelling."
"潘克洛夫两眼紧紧地盯着地面，还在寻找他的火柴盒。他甚至爬上了河的左岸，从河口一直找到停泊木筏的地方。他又返回高地，到处仔细检查了一遍，森林边缘上高高的草丛里也搜了一遍，还是徒劳无功。","Pencroft, his eyes fixed on the ground, still looked for his box.He even climbed up the left bank of the river from its mouth to the angle where the raft had been moored.He returned to the plateau, went over it in every direction, searched among the high grass on the border of the forest, all in vain."
"晚上五点钟的时候，他和赫伯特再次回到洞中。不用说，他们把洞里最黑暗的角落都彻底翻了个遍，才不得不绝望地放弃寻找。接近六点钟，太阳正从西边的高地落下去的时候，在海滩来回踱步的赫伯特示意纳布和史佩莱回来了。","It was five in the evening when he and Herbert re-entered the cave.It is useless to say that the darkest corners of the passages were ransacked before they were obliged to give it up in despair.Towards six o’clock, when the sun was disappearing behind the high lands of the west, Herbert, who was walking up and down on the strand, signalized the return of Neb and Spilett."
"他们自己回来的！那个少年的心一下子沉了下去，水手的预测没有错，果然没有找到工程师赛勒斯·哈丁！","They were returning alone!....The boy’s heart sank; the sailor had not been deceived in his forebodings; the engineer, Cyrus Harding, had not been found!"
"记者回来后就坐在岩石上，一言不发。他已经筋疲力尽，饿得要死，所以连说话的力气也没有了。","The reporter, on his arrival, sat down on a rock, without saying anything.Exhausted with fatigue, dying of hunger, he had not strength to utter a word."
"至于纳布，他那通红的双眼说明他哭得厉害，眼泪止不住地往下流，一切都清楚地说明他已经失去所有希望。","As to Neb, his red eyes showed how he had cried, and the tears which he could not restrain told too clearly that he had lost all hope."
"记者描述了他们竭力寻找塞勒斯·哈丁的整个经过。他和纳布沿着海岸一直找到八英里之外的地方，这个距离远远超出了气球最后一次着陆的范围，就在那次降落后，工程师和他的狗托普就失踪了。海岸上冷冷清清，没有一丝踪迹。鹅卵石一块都没有动过，沙滩上没有任何痕迹，那一带的海滩上连个人的脚印都没有。显然，从来就没有人踏足过这一带的海岸。大海和陆地一样荒凉，那里一定是工程师的葬身之地——离海岸几百英尺的水域。","The reporter recounted all that they had done in their attempt to recover Cyrus Harding.He and Neb had surveyed the coast for a distance of eight miles and consequently much beyond the place where the balloon had fallen the last time but one, a fall which was followed by the disappearance of the engineer and the dog Top.The shore was solitary; not a vestige of a mark.Not even a pebble recently displaced; not a trace on the sand; not a human footstep on all that part of the beach.It was clear that that portion of the shore had never been visited by a human being.The sea was as deserted as the land, and it was there, a few hundred feet from the coast, that the engineer must have found a tomb."
"史佩莱讲述完后，纳布一下子跳了起来，他的喊叫表现了内心希望的抗争，“不，他没死！他不可能死！别人也许会死，但是他绝不会！什么困境他都能摆脱！”接着他有气无力了，喃喃地说：“啊！我无能为力了！”","As Spilett ended his account, Neb jumped up, exclaiming in a voice which showed how hope struggled within him, “No! he is not dead! he can’t be dead!It might happen to any one else, but never to him!He could get out of anything!”Then his strength forsaking him, “Oh!I can do no more!” he murmured."
"“纳布，”赫伯特跑到他身边说，“我们一定能找到他的！上帝会把他还给我们的！但是，现在你饿了，必须吃点东西。”","“Neb,” said Herbert, running to him, “we will find him!God will give him back to us!But in the meantime you are hungry, and you must eat something.”"
"他一边说，一边抓几把牡蛎递给了这个可怜的黑人，这些牡蛎实在是难以下咽，又不饱腹。纳布已经有几小时没有吃东西了，但还是不肯吃。没了主人，他不能也不愿独自活下去。","So saying, he offered the poor Negro a few handfuls of shell-fish, which was indeed wretched and insufficient food.Neb had not eaten anything for several hours, but he refused them.He could not, would not live without his master."
"吉迪恩·史佩莱狼吞虎咽地吃了牡蛎，就躺在岩石脚下的沙子上睡着了。他很虚弱，但很镇定。赫伯特走到他身边，握着他的手说：“先生，我们已经找到一处住所，比躺在这里好多了。黑夜已经来临。走，去休息一下！明天我们到更远的地方去找找。”","As to Gideon Spilett, he devoured the shell-fish, then he laid himself down on the sand, at the foot of a rock.He was very weak, but calm.Herbert went up to him, and taking his hand, “Sir,” said he, “we have found a shelter which will be better than lying here.Night is advancing.Come and rest!To-morrow we will search farther.”"
"记者站了起来，跟着男孩往山洞走去。在路上，潘克洛夫用最自然的口吻问他身上有没有火柴，哪怕只有一两根也好。","The reporter got up, and guided by the boy went towards the cave.On the way, Pencroft asked him in the most natural tone, if by chance he happened to have a match or two."
"记者停下脚步，在口袋里摸了一阵，但是没有找到，他说：“我本来是有的，可能让我扔掉了。”","The reporter stopped, felt in his pockets, but finding nothing said, “I had some, but I must have thrown them away.”"
"水手又向纳布问了同样的问题，得到的答案是一样的。","The seaman then put the same question to Neb and received the same answer."
"“该死！”水手大声喊。","“Confound it!” exclaimed the sailor."
"记者听到后，一把抓住他的胳膊，问：“你没有火柴？”","The reporter heard him and seizing his arm, “Have you no matches?” he asked."
"“一根也没有，这下没法生火了。”","“Not one, and no fire in consequence.”"
"“唉！”纳布喊道，“如果主人在，他一定知道做什么！”","“Ah!” cried Neb, “if my master was here, he would know what to do!”"
"这四个落难的人站在那里一动不动，不安地看着彼此。赫伯特首先打破沉默说：“史佩莱先生，你是吸烟的，身上总带着火柴，也许你没仔细找，再试试看，一根就足够了！”","The four castaways remained motionless, looking uneasily at each other.Herbert was the first to break the silence by saying, “Mr. Spilett, you are a smoker and always have matches about you; perhaps you haven’t looked well, try again, a single match will be enough!”"
"记者又在他的裤子、坎肩和大衣的口袋里搜了一遍，令潘克洛夫极为惊喜的是，最后记者摸到一小块木棒缠在坎肩内层。他隔着衬里捏着它，但就是拿不出来。如果这真的是一根火柴，并且是唯一的一根，那么不要碰掉上面的磷尤为重要。","The reporter hunted again in the pockets of his trousers, waistcoat, and great-coat, and at last to Pencroft’s great joy, no less to his extreme surprise, he felt a tiny piece of wood entangled in the lining of his waistcoat.He seized it with his fingers through the stuff, but he could not get it out.If this was a match and a single one, it was of great importance not to rub off the phosphorus."
"“让我来试一下，可以吗？”男孩说。他非常灵巧地将不值钱但是珍贵的小木棒完好地拿了出来，它对这些可怜的人来说十分重要。这是一根还没有用过的火柴。","“Will you let me try?” said the boy, and very cleverly, without breaking it, he managed to draw out the wretched yet precious little bit of wood which was of such great importance to these poor men.It was unused."
"“好哇！”潘克洛夫大声喊起来，“有这一根就像有一整船货一样！”他拿着火柴，往洞里走去，后面跟着他的同伴们。","“Hurrah!” cried Pencroft; “it is as good as having a whole cargo!”He took the match, and, followed by his companions, entered the cave."
"这样短小的木棒，在有人居住的地方，大多会被毫不吝惜地浪费掉，并且也不值钱，但在这里，这一根却要极为小心地使用。","This small piece of wood, of which so many in an inhabited country are wasted with indifference and are of no value, must here be used with the greatest caution."
"水手首先确定它是干的，然后说：“我们需要些张纸。”","The sailor first made sure that it was quite dry; that done, “We must have some paper,” said he."
"史佩莱犹豫了片刻后，从他的笔记本上撕下一页，说：“给。”","“Here,” replied Spilett, after some hesitation tearing a leaf out of his note-book."
"潘克洛夫接过记者递给他的那张纸，跪在壁炉前。他在柴火下面垫了几把草、树叶和干燥的苔藓，这样空气容易流通，干柴能很快点着。","Pencroft took the piece of paper which the reporter held out to him, and knelt down before the fireplace.Some handfuls of grass, leaves, and dry moss were placed under the fagots and disposed in such a way that the air could easily circulate, and the dry wood would rapidly catch fire."
"于是，潘克洛夫将纸卷成圆锥的形状，像在有疾风的地方吸烟似的，把纸筒插到苔藓里。接着他拿起一小块粗糙的石头，仔细地擦了擦，心怦怦直跳。他屏住呼吸，拿火柴在上面轻轻一划。第一次尝试没有成功。潘克洛夫没有用力划，生怕擦掉上面的磷。","Pencroft then twisted the piece of paper into the shape of a cone, as smokers do in a high wind, and poked it in among the moss.Taking a small, rough stone, he wiped it carefully, and with a beating heart, holding his breath, he gently rubbed the match.The first attempt did not produce any effect.Pencroft had not struck hard enough, fearing to rub off the phosphorus."
"“不行，我点不着，”他说，“我的手发抖，火柴划不着，不行，这活我干不了！”他站起来，要换赫伯特来点。","“No, I can’t do it,” said he, “my hand trembles, the match has missed fire; I cannot, I will not!” and rising, he told Herbert to take his place."
"这个孩子长这么大一定从未这么紧张过。当时普罗米修斯到天上偷火种的时候也不会这么紧张。但是，他毫不犹豫地直接划起火柴。","Certainly the boy had never in all his life been so nervous.Prometheus going to steal the fire from heaven could not have been more anxious.He did not hesitate, however, but struck the match directly."
"只听见火柴哧的一声响，然后就升起一小团蓝色火苗，冒出一股呛鼻的烟。赫伯特快速转了一下火柴以使火苗更旺些，接着他把火柴塞进纸筒里，几秒内，纸和苔藓都燃了起来。","A little spluttering was heard and a tiny blue flame sprang up, making a choking smoke.Herbert quickly turned the match so as to augment the flame, and then slipped it into the paper cone, which in a few seconds too caught fire, and then the moss."
"水手使劲地用嘴吹，一分钟后，干柴发出噼里啪啦的响声，一堆熊熊烈火在黑暗中燃烧起来。","A minute later the dry wood crackled and a cheerful flame, assisted by the vigorous blowing of the sailor, sprang up in the midst of the darkness."
"“终于成功了！”潘克洛夫站起身来，大声说，“我有生以来从未这样紧张！”","“At last!” cried Pencroft, getting up; “I was never so nervous before in all my life!”"
"平板石构成一个顶好的壁炉。壁炉里冒出的烟很容易通到狭窄的洞口，烟囱抽着火，不一会儿，洞里就变得舒适温暖了。","The flat stones made a capital fireplace.The smoke went quite easily out at the narrow passage, the chimney drew, and an agreeable warmth was not long in being felt."
"现在他们必须十分小心不让火熄灭，并且总是保留一些火种。他们有很多木柴，而且随时可以补充燃料，因此仅需时刻留意就可以了。","They must now take great care not to let the fire go out, and always to keep some embers alight.It only needed care and attention, as they had plenty of wood and could renew their store at any time."
"潘克洛夫首先想到的是用火准备一顿比牡蛎更富有营养的晚餐。赫伯特拿过来两打蛋。记者斜靠在一个角落，静静地看着这些准备工作。他脑中萦绕着三个问题。塞勒斯还活着吗？如果他还活着，那么他在哪里呢？倘若他坠落之后大难不死，那他为什么不想办法让我们知道他还活着呢？至于纳布，他正独自一人在海滩上徘徊。他就像丢了魂一样。","Pencroft’s first thought was to use the fire by preparing a more nourishing supper than a dish of shell-fish.Two dozen eggs were brought by Herbert.The reporter leaning up in a corner, watched these preparations without saying anything.A threefold thought weighed on his mind.Was Cyrus still alive?If he was alive, where was he?If he had survived from his fall, how was it that he had not found some means of making known his existence?As to Neb, he was roaming about the shore.He was like a body without a soul."
"潘克洛夫知道五十种做蛋的方法，但是这次他别无选择，只能自得其意地把蛋放在热火灰里烤。几分钟内饭就准备好了，水手把记者喊过来共进晚餐。这是遇难者在这个未知的海滩上的第一顿美餐。这些煮熟的蛋很好吃，并且包含了人类不可缺少的各种营养，这些可怜的人感到很满足，吃完后，身体也恢复了能量。哎！要是这顿饭没有缺一个人该多好啊！如果从里士满逃脱出来的五个人都在，坐在堆积的岩石下，前面是明亮、噼啪作响的火堆，他们会怎样感谢上苍啊！但是他们一致公认的领袖，最机灵、最博学多才的塞勒斯·哈丁失踪了！他死后连个安安身之地也没有。","Pencroft knew fifty ways of cooking eggs, but this time he had no choice, and was obliged to content himself with roasting them under the hot cinders.In a few minutes the cooking was done, and the seaman invited the reporter to take his share of the supper.Such was the first repast of the castaways on this unknown coast.The hard eggs were excellent, and as eggs contain everything indispensable to man’s nourishment, these poor people thought themselves well off, and were much strengthened by them.Oh! if only one of them had not been missing at this meal!If the five prisoners who escaped from Richmond had been all there, under the piled-up rocks, before this clear, crackling fire on the dry sand, what thanksgiving must they have rendered to Heaven!But the most ingenious, the most learned, he who was their unquestioned chief, Cyrus Harding, was, alas! missing, and his body had not even obtained a burial-place."
"3月25日就这样过去了。夜幕已经降临。洞外狂风怒号，海浪拍击着岸边，发出单调的声音。海浪来回卷着沙石，发出震耳欲聋的声响。","Thus passed the 25th of March.Night had come on.Outside could be heard the howling of the wind and the monotonous sound of the surf breaking on the shore.The waves rolled the shingle backwards and forwards with a deafening noise."
"记者简单地记下了当天的事件后，就到一个黑暗的角落里休息了。他记下刚到这片新土地的景象、他们领袖的失踪、海岸的搜寻和火柴事件等等，由于太过劳累，他设法用睡眠来忘记自己的忧伤。赫伯特也直接去睡了。至于水手，整晚他都在用一只眼睛盯着火苗，并不停地给它补充燃料。但是，有一个落难者没有在洞里睡觉。他就是伤心欲绝的纳布，不论同伴怎样劝他休息一下，他还是整夜在海岸徘徊，呼唤着他的主人。","The reporter retired into a dark corner after having shortly noted down the occurrences of the day; the first appearance of this new land, the loss of their leader, the exploration of the coast, the incident of the matches, etc.; and then overcome by fatigue, he managed to forget his sorrows in sleep.Herbert went to sleep directly.As to the sailor, he passed the night with one eye on the fire, on which he did not spare fuel.But one of the castaways did not sleep in the cave.The inconsolable, despairing Neb, notwithstanding all that his companions could say to induce him to take some rest, wandered all night long on the shore calling on his master."
"第六章","Chapter 6"
"从云端被抛到这个看似无人居住的海岸后，这些落难者很快把自己的物品清点了一下。他们除了落难时身上穿着的衣服外，就什么也没有了。然而，必须提一下，吉丁·史佩莱还留有一个笔记本和一只手表，这些无疑是他在不经意间留下来的。他们没有一样武器，一件工具，甚至连把小折刀都没有。在吊舱的时候，为了减轻气球的重量，他们把所有的东西都扔出去了。即使是丹尼尔·笛福或怀斯的小说中虚构的英雄，以及在胡安·费尔南德斯和奥克兰群岛上遭遇海难的塞尔扣克和雷纳，也绝不像他们处于这样的绝境。那些人能从自己搁浅的船上取出丰富的物资，如粮食、家畜、工具、弹药，或是在海岸找到别人丢弃的物品，从而能为他们提供生活急需品。但在这里，没有任何工具，一个器皿也没有。他们必须从零开始，为自己创造一切。","The inventory of the articles possessed by these castaways from the clouds, thrown upon a coast which appeared to be uninhabited, was soon made out.They had nothing, save the clothes which they were wearing at the time of the catastrophe.We must mention, however, a note-book and a watch which Gideon Spilett had kept, doubtless by inadvertence, not a weapon, not a tool, not even a pocket-knife; for while in the car they had thrown out everything to lighten the balloon.The imaginary heroes of Daniel Defoe or of Wyss, as well as Selkirk and Raynal shipwrecked on Juan Fernandez and on the archipelago of the Aucklands, were never in such absolute destitution.Either they had abundant resources from their stranded vessels, in grain, cattle, tools, ammunition, or else some things were thrown up on the coast which supplied them with all the first necessities of life.But here, not any instrument whatever, not a utensil.From nothing they must supply themselves with everything."
"可是，如果赛勒斯·哈丁和他们在一起，如果这位工程师能把他知道的实用科学、创造思维运用起来，也许他们还有一线希望。唉！他们一定再没指望见到赛勒斯·哈丁了。这些落难者不能期待任何事情，只能寄希望于他们自己以及上帝了，他绝不会抛弃有真诚信仰的人。","And yet, if Cyrus Harding had been with them, if the engineer could have brought his practical science, his inventive mind to bear on their situation, perhaps all hope would not have been lost.Alas! they must hope no longer again to see Cyrus Harding.The castaways could expect nothing but from themselves and from that Providence which never abandons those whose faith is sincere."
"但是他们该不该在这个岸边住下来呢？他们还不知道这里属于哪个大陆，有没有人居住，或者他们是不是处在一个荒岛的海岸。","But ought they to establish themselves on this part of the coast, without trying to know to what continent it belonged, if it was inhabited, or if they were on the shore of a desert island?"
"这是个很重要的问题，必须毫不拖延地尽快解决。有了答案，他们才知道要采取什么措施。但是，潘克洛夫建议最好还是先等上几天，再进行勘探。事实上，他们必须准备一些食物，找到比鸟蛋和软体动物更能增强体力的食物。探险者们必须先恢复体力，才能做新的体力活。","It was an important question, and should be solved with the shortest possible delay.From its answer they would know what measures to take.However, according to Pencroft’s advice, it appeared best to wait a few days before commencing an exploration.They must, in fact, prepare some provisions and procure more strengthening food than eggs and molluscs.The explorers, before undertaking new fatigues, must first of all recruit their strength."
"“石窟”目前还足以供他们容身。火生起来了，保存炭火就很容易。岩石缝里和沙滩上有不少鸟蛋和贝壳类软体动物。高地上空有上百只鸽子在飞翔，用棍子或石块都很容易打下几只。附近森林的树上也许还有供他们食用的果子。最后，这里还有淡水。","The Chimneys offered a retreat sufficient for the present.The fire was lighted, and it was easy to preserve some embers.There were plenty of shell-fish and eggs among the rocks and on the beach.It would be easy to kill a few of the pigeons which were flying by hundreds about the summit of the plateau, either with sticks or stones.Perhaps the trees of the neighboring forest would supply them with eatable fruit.Lastly, the sweet water was there."
"于是他们决定在“石窟”里呆几天，为探险做些准备，要么沿着海岸，要么深入岛内。纳布特别赞同这个计划。他坚持自己的想法和预感，不想马上离开这个海岸——他们出事的地方。他不相信，也不愿意相信赛勒斯·哈丁已经死了。不会的，纳布认为，像他这样的人似乎不会以这么普通的方式离去——被海浪冲走，淹死在离海岸几百英里的水里。只要海浪没把工程师的尸体冲上岸，只要他——纳布，没有亲眼看见主人的尸体，没有亲手触摸到主人的手，他不会相信主人死了！这种想法已经在他坚决的心中里扎了根，比以往更深。或许，这只是一种幻想，但却是值得尊重的幻想，因而水手也不想点破。至于水手自己，则不抱任何希望，但和纳布争辩也是无济于事的。纳布像一条小狗，不愿离开埋葬主人的地方，而且似乎悲恸得活不下去了。","It was accordingly settled that for a few days they would remain at the Chimneys so as to prepare themselves for an expedition, either along the shore or into the interior of the country.This plan suited Neb particularly.As obstinate in his ideas as in his presentiments, he was in no haste to abandon this part of the coast, the scene of the catastrophe.He did not, he would not believe in the loss of Cyrus Harding.No, it did not seem to him possible that such a man had ended in this vulgar fashion, carried away by a wave, drowned in the floods, a few hundred feet from a shore.As long as the waves had not cast up the body of the engineer, as long as he, Neb, had not seen with his eyes, touched with his hands the corpse of his master, he would not believe in his death!And this idea rooted itself deeper than ever in his determined heart.An illusion perhaps, but still an illusion to be respected, and one which the sailor did not wish to destroy.As for him, he hoped no longer, but there was no use in arguing with Neb.He was like the dog who will not leave the place where his master is buried, and his grief was such that most probably he would not survive him."
"3月26日早晨，天刚刚亮，纳布就从海岸出发朝北走去，他回到出事的地方，不幸的哈丁就是在这里被大海吞没的。","This same morning, the 26th of March, at daybreak, Neb had set out on the shore in a northerly direction, and he had returned to the spot where the sea, no doubt, had closed over the unfortunate Harding."
"那天的早饭吃的仅仅是鸽蛋和石蛏。赫伯特在岩石凹处找到一些由于海水蒸发而沉积下来的盐，这种矿物质来得正是时候。","That day’s breakfast was composed solely of pigeon’s eggs and lithodomes.Herbert had found some salt deposited by evaporation in the hollows of the rocks, and this mineral was very welcome."
"吃完饭后，潘克洛夫问记者愿不愿意陪他和赫伯特一起去森林，他们准备去那里打猎。但考虑再三，他们认为必须要有人留下来照看火堆，并且在纳布需要帮助时及时搭把手，尽管他找到赛勒斯·哈丁的可能性很小。于是，记者决定留了下来。","The repast ended, Pencroft asked the reporter if he wished to accompany Herbert and himself to the forest, where they were going to try to hunt.But on consideration, it was thought necessary that someone should remain to keep in the fire, and to be at hand in the highly improbable event of Neb requiring aid.The reporter accordingly remained behind."
"“打猎去吧，赫伯特，”水手说，“我们应该在路上找些弹药，在树林里造些武器。”但是就在要出发的时候，赫伯特提议，既然他们没有火绒，也许可以用其他东西来替代，这样更稳妥一些。","“To the chase, Herbert,” said the sailor.“We shall find ammunition on our way, and cut our weapons in the forest.”But at the moment of starting, Herbert observed, that since they had no tinder, it would perhaps be prudent to replace it by another substance."
"“什么东西呢？”潘克洛夫问道。","“What?” asked Pencroft."
"“烧焦的亚麻布，”少年回答说，“在必要时可作为火绒使用。”","“Burnt linen,” replied the boy.“That could in case of need serve for tinder.”"
"水手觉得这个主意很不错。唯一的麻烦是需要牺牲一块手帕。但这个办法值得一试，于是潘克洛夫的大格子手帕很快被烧成一块半焦的布。他们把这块易燃的焦布放在洞中间一块岩石小洞的底部，那里可以避风挡潮。","The sailor thought it very sensible advice.Only it had the inconvenience of necessitating the sacrifice of a piece of handkerchief.Notwithstanding, the thing was well worth while trying, and a part of Pencroft’s large checked handkerchief was soon reduced to the state of a half-burnt rag.This inflammable material was placed in the central chamber at the bottom of a little cavity in the rock, sheltered from all wind and damp."
"这时是上午九点钟了。天气恶劣，刮着东南风。赫伯特和潘克洛夫绕过“石窟”的拐角，时不时地看一看从岩石顶部冒出的袅袅轻烟，然后他们沿着河的左岸而上。","It was nine o’clock in the morning.The weather was threatening and the breeze blew from the southeast.Herbert and Pencroft turned the angle of the Chimneys, not without having cast a look at the smoke which, just at that place, curled round a point of rock: they ascended the left bank of the river."
"进入树林后，潘克洛夫就从迎面的一棵树上扳下两根粗壮的树枝，做成木棍，而赫伯特则在一块石头上把棍子的两头磨平。哦！要是能有一把刀，他们会不惜一切代价去换取的！","Arrived at the forest, Pencroft broke from the first tree two stout branches which he transformed into clubs, the ends of which Herbert rubbed smooth on a rock.Oh! what would they not have given for a knife!"
"随后，两位猎人沿着河岸在深草丛中前行。河流朝西南方向拐了个弯，便渐渐变窄了，两岸很高，上面的树枝形成一座双拱门。为了不迷路，潘克洛夫决定沿着河往前走，这样总能把他们带回到出发的地方。但是岸上的路并不好走，有些地方柔韧的树枝垂到水面上，而有些地方爬藤和荆棘丛生，需要用棍子开路。赫伯特常常像一只灵巧的小猫，在断掉的树桩里跑来跑去，一会儿又消失在矮树丛中。但潘克洛夫马上把他叫回来，并央告他别走远了。同时，水手仔细地观察着周围的情况和动静。河岸左边，地势平坦，多沼泽，向内陆缓缓升高。这里看起来像一片水网，这些水无疑是通过一些地下沟渠流向河里。有时会有一条小溪流过矮树丛，但他们要跨过并不费事。河的对岸更加崎岖不平，而峡谷却清晰可见，河水就从峡谷底部流过。一座小山，上面长满了树木，形成一道屏障，挡住了视线。在河岸右边行走会很困难，因为这里的斜坡突然变陡，弯向水面的树木全靠根部支撑着。","The two hunters now advanced among the long grass, following the bank.From the turning which directed its course to the southwest, the river narrowed gradually and the channel lay between high banks, over which the trees formed a double arch.Pencroft, lest they should lose themselves, resolved to follow the course of the stream, which would always lead them back to the point from which they started.But the bank was not without some obstacles: here, the flexible branches of the trees bent level with the current; there, creepers and thorns which they had to break down with their sticks.Herbert often glided among the broken stumps with the agility of a young cat, and disappeared in the underwood.But Pencroft called him back directly, begging him not to wander away.Meanwhile, the sailor attentively observed the disposition and nature of the surrounding country.On the left bank, the ground, which was flat and marshy, rose imperceptibly towards the interior.It looked there like a network of liquid threads which doubtless reached the river by some underground drain.Sometimes a stream ran through the underwood, which they crossed without difficulty.The opposite shore appeared to be more uneven, and the valley of which the river occupied the bottom was more clearly visible.The hill, covered with trees disposed in terraces, intercepted the view.On the right bank walking would have been difficult, for the declivities fell suddenly, and the trees bending over the water were only sustained by the strength of their roots."
"不用说，这片树林和已勘探过的海岸一样，都没有人类生活的迹象。潘克洛夫只发现了一些四足兽的足迹，这是动物新近留下的脚印，但他辨别不出究竟是什么动物。可以肯定的是——这也是赫伯特的看法——有些脚印是凶猛的野兽留下来的，这无疑会给他们带来麻烦。不过他们并没有发现树上有斧子砍过的痕迹，也没有火堆的余灰，更没有人类的足迹。这一点或许值得他们庆幸，因为在太平洋中央的任何一个岛屿上，有人出现也许更可怕。赫伯特和潘克洛夫几乎都不说话，由于路很难走，前进很慢，一个小时后，他们才勉强走了一英里多。到目前为止，打猎还一无所获。不过，枝叶间还有小鸟在鸣叫着飞来飞去，显得非常胆怯，似乎看到了人类，引发了它们本能的恐惧。在树林的一片沼泽地带，赫伯特指出其中一种鸟很像翠鸟，嘴又长又尖，虽然羽毛有着金属般的光泽，却并不好看。","It is needless to add that this forest, as well as the coast already surveyed, was destitute of any sign of human life.Pencroft only saw traces of quadrupeds, fresh footprints of animals, of which he could not recognize the species.In all probability, and such was also Herbert’s opinion, some had been left by formidable wild beasts which doubtless would give them some trouble; but nowhere did they observe the mark of an axe on the trees, nor the ashes of a fire, nor the impression of a human foot.On this they might probably congratulate themselves, for on any land in the middle of the Pacific the presence of man was perhaps more to be feared than desired.Herbert and Pencroft speaking little, for the difficulties of the way were great, advanced very slowly, and after walking for an hour they had scarcely gone more than a mile.As yet the hunt had not been successful.However, some birds sang and fluttered in the foliage, and appeared very timid, as if man had inspired them with an instinctive fear.Among others, Herbert described, in a marshy part of the forest, a bird with a long pointed beak, closely resembling the king-fisher, but its plumage was not fine, though of a metallic brilliancy."
"“那一定是啄木鸟。”赫伯特一边说，一边试着靠近。","“That must be a jacamar,” said Herbert, trying to get nearer."
"“这可是个尝啄木鸟味道的好机会，”水手说，“就看它愿不愿意让我们烤一烤啦！”","“This will be a good opportunity to taste jacamar,” replied the sailor, “if that fellow is in a humor to be roasted!”"
"就在这时，少年灵巧地扔出一块石头，击中了啄木鸟的翅膀，但并没有把它打下，鸟儿迅速飞走，一转眼就消失了。","Just then, a stone cleverly thrown by the boy, struck the creature on the wing, but the blow did not disable it, and the jacamar ran off and disappeared in an instant."
"“我真笨拙！”赫伯特喊道。","“How clumsy I am!” cried Herbert."
"“不，不，孩子！”水手回答说，“你这下子扔得很准，别人兴许还打不中呢！算了，别气恼了。改天我们会逮住它的！”","“No, no, my boy!” replied the sailor.“The blow was well aimed; many a one would have missed it altogether!Come, don’t be vexed with yourself.We shall catch it another day!”"
"猎人们继续往前走，树木越来越稀疏，许多树都很漂亮，只是结的果子都不能食用。潘克洛夫寻找着一些在日常生活中用途很广的珍贵棕榈树，但徒劳无功，这种树木只能生长在北纬40度与南纬35度之间的地带。这片森林只有针叶树，比如赫伯特已经认出来的喜马拉雅雪松，类似于长在美洲西北部海岸的洋松，以及高达150英尺的冷杉。","As the hunters advanced, the trees were found to be more scattered, many being magnificent, but none bore eatable fruit.Pencroft searched in vain for some of those precious palm-trees which are employed in so many ways in domestic life, and which have been found as far as the fortieth parallel in the Northern Hemisphere, and to the thirty-fifth only in the Southern Hemisphere.But this forest was only composed of coniferae, such as deodaras, already recognized by Herbert, and Douglas pine, similar to those which grow on the northwest coast of America, and splendid firs, measuring a hundred and fifty feet in height."
"这时飞来一群小鸟，长着漂亮的羽毛，长尾闪着光亮，随后，它们分散开来立在枝头，身子一抖，羽毛纷纷落下，仿佛为地面铺上了一层上好的鸭绒。赫伯特捡起几根羽毛，看了看——","At this moment a flock of birds, of a small size and pretty plumage, with long glancing tails, dispersed themselves among the branches strewing their feathers, which covered the ground as with fine down.Herbert picked up a few of these feathers, and after having examined them,—"
"然后说：“这些是锦鸡。”","“These are couroucous,” said he."
"“我倒宁愿是松鸡或珠鸡，”潘克洛夫说，“不过，假如它们好吃的话……”","“I should prefer a moor-cock or guinea-fowl,” replied Pencroft, “still, if they are good to eat—”"
"“它们很好吃，肉质也很嫩，”赫伯特回答说，“而且，如果我没记错的话，可以很容易靠近它们，用棍子把它们打死。”","“They are good to eat, and also their flesh is very delicate,” replied Herbert.“Besides, if I don’t mistake, it is easy to approach and kill them with a stick.”"
"水手和少年爬过草丛，来到一棵树下，这棵树靠近地面的枝丫上歇满了锦鸡。它们正等着捕食爬过来的昆虫，这是它们的养料。锦鸡用它们的毛爪勾住细小的树枝，以此立在树上。","The sailor and the lad, creeping among the grass, arrived at the foot of a tree, whose lower branches were covered with little birds.The couroucous were waiting the passage of insects which served for their nourishment.Their feathery feet could be seen clasping the slender twigs which supported them."
"此时，猎手站起身来，像使用镰刀一般挥动他们的棍子，打下一排的锦鸡，它们都没想过要飞走，就呆呆地任凭被打落在地。等到剩下的锦鸡想到要飞走时，地上已堆积了上百只。","The hunters then rose, and using their sticks like scythes, they mowed down whole rows of these couroucous, who never thought of flying away, and stupidly allowed themselves to be knocked off.A hundred were already heaped on the ground, before the others made up their minds to fly."
"“好啊！”潘克洛夫说，“这种猎物倒是很适合我们这样的猎手。我们只要伸手逮住它们就可以了。”","“Well,” said Pencroft, “here is game, which is quite within the reach of hunters like us.We have only to put out our hands and take it!”"
"水手将锦鸡穿成串，像柔软细枝上的云雀，之后他们又继续勘探。河水朝南拐了个弯，但这个弯不大，因为河水的源头肯定就在山里，由覆盖主峰的积雪融汇而成。","The sailor having strung the couroucous like larks on flexible twigs, they then continued their exploration.The stream here made a bend towards the south, but this detour was probably not prolonged for the river must have its source in the mountain, and be supplied by the melting of the snow which covered the sides of the central cone."
"他们这次远足的特殊任务已经说过了，就是要给“石窟”的居民提供尽可能多的猎物。必须承认，到目前为止，这个任务还没有完成。因此水手还在积极搜寻，突然，有只动物窜进草丛中，他还没来得及看清是什么，便大喊起来：“要是托普在就好了！”但是托普和它的主人同时失踪了，大概他们一起死了。","The particular object of their expedition was, as has been said, to procure the greatest possible quantity of game for the inhabitants of the Chimneys.It must be acknowledged that as yet this object had not been attained.So the sailor actively pursued his researches, though he exclaimed, when some animal which he had not even time to recognize fled into the long grass, “If only we had had the dog Top!”But Top had disappeared at the same time as his master, and had probably perished with him."
"快三点的时候，他们看见一些树上又飞来一群鸟，它们正在啄食杜松的芳香果实。突然，林子里回响起一阵喇叭似的长鸣。这种奇怪又响亮的鸣声是由一种在美国被称作松鸡的猎鸟发出来的。他们很快就看到了好几对，这种松鸡身上的羽毛是鲜艳的栗色，夹杂着深褐色的斑纹，尾巴也呈深褐色。赫伯特认得公鸟的脖子上凸起的两片像翅膀似的肉瓣。潘克洛夫打定主意至少要逮到一只松鸡，因为这种鹑鸡类动物大小和普通的鸡差不多，可肉质胜过笋鸡。不过要抓住它们却很困难，因为它们不让人靠近。试了几次，一点收获也没有，只是把松鸡给吓跑了，于是水手对少年说：","Towards three o’clock new flocks of birds were seen through certain trees, at whose aromatic berries they were pecking, those of the juniper-tree among others.Suddenly a loud trumpet call resounded through the forest.This strange and sonorous cry was produced by a game bird called grouse in the United States.They soon saw several couples, whose plumage was rich chestnut-brown mottled with dark brown, and tail of the same color.Herbert recognized the males by the two wing-like appendages raised on the neck.Pencroft determined to get hold of at least one of these gallinaceae, which were as large as a fowl, and whose flesh is better than that of a pullet.But it was difficult, for they would not allow themselves to be approached.After several fruitless attempts, which resulted in nothing but scaring the grouse, the sailor said to the lad,—"
"“很显然它们飞的时候我们抓不着，那必须设法用绳子来逮了。”","“Decidedly, since we can’t kill them on the wing, we must try to take them with a line.”"
"“像钓鱼一样吗？”赫伯特听了这个提议后，惊讶地叫了起来。","“Like a fish?” cried Herbert, much surprised at the proposal."
"“就像钓鱼一样。”水手非常严肃地回答道。潘克洛夫在草丛里发现六个松鸡窝，每个窝里有三四只蛋。他小心翼翼，尽量不碰到窝，因为窝的主人迟早会回来。他就打算在这些窝旁布置绳索——不是罗网，而是真正的钓线。他把赫伯特带到离松鸡窝不远的地方，在那里十分谨慎地准备好他的特殊装置，这是艾萨克·沃尔顿的弟子曾经使用过的办法。赫伯特饶有兴趣地看着他工作，虽然心里非常怀疑这能否成功。钓绳是用结实的爬藤一根接一根绑在一起的，长为15至20英尺。潘克洛夫从一棵矮小的刺槐树丛上扳下粗大坚固的倒刺，绑在爬藤的一头，当作钩子。地上爬行的红色大毛虫作为钓饵。","“Like a fish,” replied the sailor quite seriously.Pencroft had found among the grass half a dozen grouse nests, each having three or four eggs.He took great care not to touch these nests, to which their proprietors would not fail to return.It was around these that he meant to stretch his lines, not snares, but real fishing-lines.He took Herbert to some distance from the nests, and there prepared his singular apparatus with all the care which a disciple of Izaak Walton would have used.Herbert watched the work with great interest, though rather doubting its success.The lines were made of fine creepers, fastened one to the other, of the length of fifteen or twenty feet.Thick, strong thorns, the points bent back (which were supplied from a dwarf acacia bush) were fastened to the ends of the creepers, by way of hooks.Large red worms, which were crawling on the ground, furnished bait."
"做完这些后，潘克洛夫穿过草丛，隐藏得很好，把绳子装有钩子的一头放在松鸡窝附近，然后回到原处，拿着绳子的另一端，和赫伯特一起躲在一棵大树后面。他们耐心地等在那里，不过说实话，赫伯特对潘克洛夫这项发明的成功，并没有抱太大的希望。","This done, Pencroft, passing among the grass and concealing himself skillfully, placed the end of his lines armed with hooks near the grouse nests; then he returned, took the other ends and hid with Herbert behind a large tree.There they both waited patiently; though, it must be said, that Herbert did not reckon much on the success of the inventive Pencroft."
"整整半个小时过去了，都没什么动静，但不一会儿，不出水手所料，几只松鸡回窝里来了。它们走来走去，啄食地上的东西，丝毫没有怀疑附近有猎手，而猎手们特意躲在了松鸡的下风向。","A whole half-hour passed, but then, as the sailor had surmised, several couple of grouse returned to their nests.They walked along, pecking the ground, and not suspecting in any way the presence of the hunters, who, besides, had taken care to place themselves to leeward of the gallinaceae."
"少年此刻感到分外有趣。他屏住呼吸，而潘克洛夫瞪着两眼，张着嘴，双唇前伸，好像他就要品尝一块松鸡肉似的，大气也不敢出。","The lad felt at this moment highly interested.He held his breath, and Pencroft, his eyes staring, his mouth open, his lips advanced, as if about to taste a piece of grouse, scarcely breathed."
"这时，松鸡在钩子旁走来走去，丝毫没有注意到钩子。于是潘克洛夫轻轻拉了拉绳子，钓饵也微微一动，仿佛这些虫子还是活着的。","Meanwhile, the birds walked about the hooks, without taking any notice of them.Pencroft then gave little tugs which moved the bait as if the worms had been still alive."
"水手的心情显然比钓鱼的人还激动，因为钓鱼的人看不见鱼在水中上钩的情景。绳子动了后，很快就引起了松鸡的注意，它们用嘴啄钩子。三只贪吃的松鸡同时把钓饵和钩子都吞下去了。潘克洛夫突然敏捷地把绳子一拉，松鸡扑腾着翅膀——它们被逮住了。","The sailor undoubtedly felt much greater anxiety than does the fisherman, for he does not see his prey coming through the water.The jerks attracted the attention of the gallinaceae, and they attacked the hooks with their beaks.Three voracious grouse swallowed at the same moment bait and hook.Suddenly with a smart jerk, Pencroft “struck” his line, and a flapping of wings showed that the birds were taken."
"“好哇！”他边喊边朝猎物跑去，很快就成了鸡的主人。","“Hurrah!” he cried, rushing towards the game, of which he made himself master in an instant."
"赫伯特拍起手来。他还是第一次看见用绳子捕鸟，但水手很谦虚地说，他不是第一次这么干，而且这发明不是他的功劳。","Herbert clapped his hands.It was the first time that he had ever seen birds taken with a line, but the sailor modestly confessed that it was not his first attempt, and that besides he could not claim the merit of invention."
"“不管怎样，”他说，“以我们现在的处境，我们必须多想想其他的办法才行。”","“And at any rate,” added he, “situated as we are, we must hope to hit upon many other contrivances.”"
"他们绑住了松鸡的爪子，潘克洛夫很高兴不至于空手回去见他们的伙伴，并且看看天色也不早了，觉得最好返回住处。","The grouse were fastened by their claws, and Pencroft, delighted at not having to appear before their companions with empty hands, and observing that the day had begun to decline, judged it best to return to their dwelling."
"这条河为他们指明了方向，他们只需顺着河走就行，快六点的时候，赫伯特和潘克洛夫由于远足而精疲力尽，回到了“石窟”。","The direction was indicated by the river, whose course they had only to follow, and, towards six o’clock, tired enough with their excursion, Herbert and Pencroft arrived at the Chimneys."
"第七章","Chapter 7"
"吉迪恩·史佩莱双臂环抱在胸前，一动不动地站在岸边，注视着大海。海平面的东边被一团厚厚的乌云遮住了，乌云正往天的高处迅速地扩散开来。风已经刮得很猛，随着日头一点点落下，风力也愈来愈大。整个天空呈现出一幅可怕的景象，明显看得出，这是暴风雨来临的先兆。","Gideon Spilett was standing motionless on the shore, his arms crossed, gazing over the sea, the horizon of which was lost towards the east in a thick black cloud which was spreading rapidly towards the zenith.The wind was already strong, and increased with the decline of day.The whole sky was of a threatening aspect, and the first symptoms of a violent storm were clearly visible."
"赫伯特进了“石窟”，潘克洛夫朝记者走过去。史佩莱正在凝神思考，没有注意到有人过来。","Herbert entered the Chimneys, and Pencroft went towards the reporter.The latter, deeply absorbed, did not see him approach."
"“我们要度过狂风暴雨的一晚了，史佩莱先生！”水手说，“海燕就喜欢在风雨中。”","“We are going to have a dirty night, Mr. Spilett!” said the sailor: “Petrels delight in wind and rain.”"
"记者这才转过头来，看见了潘克洛夫，第一句话就是：","The reporter, turning at the moment, saw Pencroft, and his first words were,—"
"“你觉得海浪把我们的同伴卷走的时候，吊舱距海岸有多远？”","“At what distance from the coast would you say the car was, when the waves carried off our companion?”"
"水手没料到他会问这个。他想了一会儿，答道：","The sailor had not expected this question.He reflected an instant and replied,—"
"“最多有两锚链长。”","“Two cables lengths at the most.”"
"“那一锚链有多远？”吉迪恩·史佩莱问。","“But what is a cable’s length?” asked Gideon Spilett."
"“大概有120寻，就是600英尺吧。”","“About a hundred and twenty fathoms, or six hundred feet.”"
"“那么，”记者说，“赛勒斯·哈丁消失的地方离海岸至多有1200英尺了？”","“Then,” said the reporter, “Cyrus Harding must have disappeared twelve hundred feet at the most from the shore?”"
"“差不多吧。”潘克洛夫回答道。　","“About that,” replied Pencroft."
"“那他的狗也是吧？”","“And his dog also?”"
"“嗯。”","“Also.”"
"“我感到吃惊的是，”记者接着说，“虽然承认我们的同伴死了，托普也死了，怎么狗和它主人的尸体都没有被冲到海岸上呢？”","“What astonishes me,” rejoined the reporter, “while admitting that our companion has perished, is that Top has also met his death, and that neither the body of the dog nor of his master has been cast on the shore!”"
"“海浪这么大，这也没什么奇怪的。”水手答道，“况且，也可能海浪沿着海岸向下，把他们卷到更远的地方去了。”","“It is not astonishing, with such a heavy sea,” replied the sailor.“Besides, it is possible that currents have carried them farther down the coast.”"
"“那么，在你看来，我们的朋友已经死在大海里了吗？”记者又问道。","“Then, it is your opinion that our friend has perished in the waves?” again asked the reporter."
"“我想是这样。”","“That is my opinion.”"
"吉迪恩·史佩莱听了说：“潘克洛夫，虽然我佩服你的经验，但我觉得，在赛勒斯和托普一起彻底失踪这件事上，不管他们现在是死是活，都有点不可思议，不太可能。”","“My own opinion,” said Gideon Spilett, “with due deference to your experience, Pencroft, is that in the double fact of the absolute disappearance of Cyrus and Top, living or dead, there is something unaccountable and unlikely.”"
"“我真希望我也能像你这么想，史佩莱先生，”潘克洛夫回答，“不幸的是，在这个问题上，我的想法已经不会改变了。”说完，水手回“石窟”了。炉架上的大火烧得噼里啪啦地响。赫伯特刚刚往上面扔了一抱干木柴，火焰发出的光就把通道里最暗的地方都照得通红。","“I wish I could think like you, Mr. Spilett,” replied Pencroft; “unhappily, my mind is made up on this point.”Having said this, the sailor returned to the Chimneys.A good fire crackled on the hearth.Herbert had just thrown on an armful of dry wood, and the flame cast a bright light into the darkest parts of the passage."
"潘克洛夫立马开始准备晚饭。大伙都需要增强体力，所以，要是能添一些充饥的食物，似乎再好不过了。他们把穿成串的锦鸡留到明天吃，给一对松鸡拔了毛，很快就叉在木棍上，放在熊熊的火焰上烤着。","Pencroft immediately began to prepare the dinner.It appeared best to introduce something solid into the bill of fare, for all needed to get up their strength.The strings of couroucous were kept for the next day, but they plucked a couple of grouse, which were soon spitted on a stick, and roasting before a blazing fire."
"晚上七点钟时，纳布还没有回来。黑人这么长时间都不在，潘克洛夫很担心他。他担心黑人可能在这片未知的岛上遭遇了什么意外，或者这个伤心的家伙因为绝望，做了什么傻事。不过，赫伯特得出的结论却大不相同。他觉得，纳布之所以这么晚还没回来，是因为发现了一些新情况，这才引着他继续寻找下去。而且，任何新情况都肯定对赛勒斯·哈丁有利。除非是有希望引着纳布继续寻找下去，要不他为什么还不回来？或许他发现了什么标记，一串脚印，或者某种痕迹，正领着他往对的地方去。他可能此刻正往某个地方去。甚至可能离他的主人没几步了。","At seven in the evening Neb had not returned.The prolonged absence of the Negro made Pencroft very uneasy.It was to be feared that he had met with an accident on this unknown land, or that the unhappy fellow had been driven to some act of despair.But Herbert drew very different conclusions from this absence.According to him, Neb’s delay was caused by some new circumstances which had induced him to prolong his search.Also, everything new must be to the advantage of Cyrus Harding.Why had Neb not returned unless hope still detained him?Perhaps he had found some mark, a footstep, a trace which had put him in the right path.Perhaps he was at this moment on a certain track.Perhaps even he was near his master."
"孩子这般推测着。然后说出自己的想法。他的同伴们听着他讲。只有记者一个人打了个手势，表示赞同。但是，潘克洛夫认为最有可能的是，纳布在海岸上的搜寻范围比昨天还要远，因此才没有时间赶回来。","Thus the lad reasoned.Thus he spoke.His companions let him talk.The reporter alone approved with a gesture.But what Pencroft thought most probable was, that Neb had pushed his researches on the shore farther than the day before, and that he had not as yet had time to return."
"赫伯特被一种说不清的预感搅得心神不宁，几次表示要出去寻找纳布。但潘克洛夫使他确信，这是做无用功，外面一片漆黑，天气恶劣，他不可能寻到纳布的踪迹，最好还是等着。要是纳布第二天还没回来的话，潘克洛夫会毫不犹豫地和他一起出去搜寻。","Herbert, however, agitated by vague presentiments, several times manifested an intention to go to meet Neb.But Pencroft assured him that that would be a useless course, that in the darkness and deplorable weather he could not find any traces of Neb, and that it would be much better to wait.If Neb had not made his appearance by the next day, Pencroft would not hesitate to join him in his search."
"吉迪恩·史佩莱同意水手的观点，认为大家最好还是不要分开，赫伯特应该被迫放弃他的计划，但两颗大大的泪珠却从他的眼中流了下来。","Gideon Spilett approved of the sailor’s opinion that it was best not to divide, and Herbert was obliged to give up his project; but two large tears fell from his eyes."
"记者情不自禁地将这个善良的孩子搂在怀里。","The reporter could not refrain from embracing the generous boy."
"天气现在变坏了。东南方刮来的一阵强风，扫荡了海岸。大海咆哮着，捶打着礁石。倾盆大雨被狂风冲撞着，好似漫天灰粒。一大团激起的水汽沿着海岸长驱直下，岸边的砾石痛苦地发出哗啦啦的声响，仿佛被一大车一大车往外倾倒似的。大风卷起砂石，像是在水中掺进了矿质的尘土，这种联合袭击实在让人难以承受。在河口和峭壁底端之间，风如漩涡般回旋着，大风抽打着狭窄峡谷间的流水。“石窟”中冒出的烟也通过缝隙倒灌进来，填满了通道，让人在里面呆不下去。","Bad weather now set in.A furious gale from the southeast passed over the coast.The sea roared as it beat over the reef.Heavy rain was dashed by the storm into particles like dust.Ragged masses of vapor drove along the beach, on which the tormented shingles sounded as if poured out in cart-loads, while the sand raised by the wind added as it were mineral dust to that which was liquid, and rendered the united attack insupportable.Between the river’s mouth and the end of the cliff, eddies of wind whirled and gusts from this maelstrom lashed the water which ran through the narrow valley.The smoke from the fireplace was also driven back through the opening, filling the passages and rendering them uninhabitable."
"因此，松鸡烤好后，潘克洛夫就让把火灭了，只把几块木炭埋在了灰烬下面。","Therefore, as the grouse were cooked, Pencroft let the fire die away, and only preserved a few embers buried under the ashes."
"到了八点，纳布依然没有回来。不过，毫无疑问，单是这可怕的天气，就能将他拦挡在外头了，他一定在哪个山洞里避着，打算等到暴风雨停了，或至少第二天再回来。现在去接他，或是到外面找找他，都是不可能的。","At eight o’clock Neb had not appeared, but there was no doubt that the frightful weather alone hindered his return, and that he must have taken refuge in some cave, to await the end of the storm or at least the return of day.As to going to meet him, or attempting to find him, it was impossible."
"松鸡是晚餐上唯一的菜，肉很鲜美。潘克洛夫和赫伯特经过了一天的长途跋涉，都饿极了，无比满足地狼吞虎咽。","The game constituted the only dish at supper; the meat was excellent, and Pencroft and Herbert, whose long excursion had rendered them very hungry, devoured it with infinite satisfaction."
"吃完晚饭，每个人都回到自己前一天晚上歇息的角落睡觉。水手四仰八叉地躺在火堆旁边，赫伯特紧挨着他，很快就睡着了。","Their meal concluded, each retired to the corner in which he had rested the preceding night, and Herbert was not long in going to sleep near the sailor, who had stretched himself beside the fireplace."
"外面，夜慢慢变深，暴风雨也更大了，最后变得跟把这群俘虏从里士满带到这个太平洋小岛上来的情况差不多了。春秋分时常有暴风雨，而且这种天气经常会带来大的灾难，在这一望无际的海洋上，它们肆无忌惮地咆哮着，因此显得尤为可怕。当狂风拍打在毫不设防的海滩上时，那种可怕的力量简直难以形容。","Outside, as the night advanced, the tempest also increased in strength, until it was equal to that which had carried the prisoners from Richmond to this land in the Pacific.The tempests which are frequent during the seasons of the equinox, and which are so prolific in catastrophes, are above all terrible over this immense ocean, which opposes no obstacle to their fury.No description can give an idea of the terrific violence of the gale as it beat upon the unprotected coast."
"令人高兴的是，构成“石窟”的岩石很坚固。整个“石窟”由巨大的花岗岩石构成，其中有几块不大牢固，似乎在底部颤动。潘克洛夫把头枕在石块上时，可以感觉到头底下快速的震动。不过，他不停地劝慰自己——也有道理——没什么可怕的，他们的避难所不会倒塌的。然而，他听到高地的顶上有石头被风刮走，噼里啪啦地落在了海岸上。有几块甚至滚到了“石窟”的顶上，还有的被风直上直下地扔下去，七零八碎地四下乱飞。水手两次爬起来，借助通道的入口处挡住身子，好在安全处看一眼外面的情况。这些从天而降的“石块阵雨”并没有多少，用不着害怕，因此他又回到火堆前躺下，灰烬下的木炭还在发着红光。","Happily the pile of rocks which formed the Chimneys was solid.It was composed of enormous blocks of granite, a few of which, insecurely balanced, seemed to tremble on their foundations, and Pencroft could feel rapid quiverings under his head as it rested on the rock.But he repeated to himself, and rightly, that there was nothing to fear, and that their retreat would not give way.However he heard the noise of stones torn from the summit of the plateau by the wind, falling down on to the beach.A few even rolled on to the upper part of the Chimneys, or flew off in fragments when they were projected perpendicularly.Twice the sailor rose and intrenched himself at the opening of the passage, so as to take a look in safety at the outside.But there was nothing to be feared from these showers, which were not considerable, and he returned to his couch before the fireplace, where the embers glowed beneath the ashes."
"尽管外头狂风暴雨在咆哮，雷声隆隆，赫伯特还是睡得很熟。潘克洛夫最后也终于睡着了，水手生涯使他对一切都习以为常。只有吉迪恩·史佩莱因为担忧一直醒着。他责备自己没有跟纳布一起去。显然他还没有放弃所有希望。让赫伯特心神不宁的预感也同样使他担心不已。他现在满脑子想的都是纳布。纳布怎么还没回来？他在自己的沙床上辗转反侧，几乎完全没理会外面的狂风暴雨。有时，他会合上因疲劳而沉重的眼皮，但不一会儿，就会因为某个突然闪现的念头，马上又睁开眼睛。","Notwithstanding the fury of the hurricane, the uproar of the tempest, the thunder, and the tumult, Herbert slept profoundly.Sleep at last took possession of Pencroft, whom a seafaring life had habituated to anything.Gideon Spilett alone was kept awake by anxiety.He reproached himself with not having accompanied Neb.It was evident that he had not abandoned all hope.The presentiments which had troubled Herbert did not cease to agitate him also.His thoughts were concentrated on Neb.Why had Neb not returned?He tossed about on his sandy couch, scarcely giving a thought to the struggle of the elements.Now and then, his eyes, heavy with fatigue, closed for an instant, but some sudden thought reopened them almost immediately."
"夜色越来越浓了。离天亮差不多有两个钟头的时候，还在呼呼大睡的潘克洛夫被猛烈摇醒了。","Meanwhile the night advanced, and it was perhaps two hours from morning, when Pencroft, then sound asleep, was vigorously shaken."
"“怎么了？”他醒过来，叫道,以水手素有的敏捷恢复了神志。","“What’s the matter?” he cried, rousing himself, and collecting his ideas with the promptitude usual to seamen."
"记者正俯着身子，对他说：","The reporter was leaning over him, and saying,—"
"“听，潘克洛夫，听！”","“Listen, Pencroft, listen!”"
"水手努力张开耳朵，但是除了暴风雨的声音，什么也听不到。","The sailor strained his ears, but could hear no noise beyond those caused by the storm."
"“是风声。”他说。","“It is the wind,” said he."
"“不是，”吉迪恩·史佩莱回答，又听了听，“我想我听见了……”","“No,” replied Gideon Spilett, listening again, “I thought I heard—”"
"“什么？”","“What?”"
"“狗叫声！”","“The barking of a dog!”"
"“狗！”潘克洛夫跳起来，喊道。","“A dog!” cried Pencroft, springing up."
"“是的，狗在叫。”","“Yes—barking—”"
"“不可能！”水手回答，“何况是在咆哮的暴风雨里。”","“It’s not possible!” replied the sailor.“And besides, how, in the roaring of the storm—”"
"“等一下，你听。”记者又说。","“Stop—listen—” said the reporter."
"潘克洛夫又更加仔细地听了一会儿，在风雨间歇的片刻，他觉得真的听见了远远的狗叫声。","Pencroft listened more attentively, and really thought he heard, during a lull, distant barking."
"“太好了！”记者说，使劲握了握潘克洛夫的手。","“Well!” said the reporter, pressing the sailor’s hand."
"“是……是啊！”潘克洛夫回答。","“Yes—yes!” replied Pencroft."
"“是托普！是托普！”刚刚醒来的赫伯特喊着，三个人一起冲到“石窟”的入口处。他们要出去实在是太困难了。狂风直把他们往后推。最后，三个人终于出来了，可也只能把身体靠在岩石上，才能站立。他们四处张望着，但无法张嘴说话。天色非常暗。大海、天空和陆地全都变成黑漆漆的一团，看不到一丝光亮。","“It is Top!It is Top!” cried Herbert, who had just awoke; and all three rushed towards the opening of the Chimneys.They had great difficulty in getting out.The wind drove them back.But at last they succeeded, and could only remain standing by leaning against the rocks.They looked about, but could not speak.The darkness was intense.The sea, the sky, the land were all mingled in one black mass.Not a speck of light was visible."
"记者和同伴们这样站了几分钟，狂风堵住了他们的去路，他们浑身都被雨水淋透了，视线被沙子挡住了。","The reporter and his companions remained thus for a few minutes, overwhelmed by the wind, drenched by the rain, blinded by the sand."
"然后，在风雨声稍小的时候，他们又听到了狗叫声，断定声音离这里还有一段距离。","Then, in a pause of the tumult, they again heard the barking, which they found must be at some distance."
"肯定是托普！不过是只有托普自己，还是有人和它一起呢？很可能只有托普自己，因为，如果纳布在旁边，肯定会直接朝“石窟”这边来的。因为同伴无法听见他说话，水手使劲捏了一下记者的手，意思是让他“等一下”，然后转身又进了通道。","It could only be Top!But was he alone or accompanied?He was most probably alone, for, if Neb had been with him, he would have made his way more directly towards the Chimneys.The sailor squeezed the reporter’s hand, for he could not make himself heard, in a way which signified “Wait!” then he reentered the passage."
"不一会儿，他拿着一束点燃的木柴出来了，然后把木柴扔进黑暗里，响亮地吹了一声口哨。","An instant after he issued with a lighted fagot, which he threw into the darkness, whistling shrilly."
"似乎远处一直在等待这个信号，瞬时间狗叫声越来越近了，不一会儿，一只狗冲进了通道。潘克洛夫、赫伯特和史佩莱跟在它后头进来了。","It appeared as if this signal had been waited for; the barking immediately came nearer, and soon a dog bounded into the passage.Pencroft, Herbert, and Spilett entered after him."
"他们往火炭上加了一抱干木柴，整个通道都被熊熊火焰照亮了。","An armful of dry wood was thrown on the embers.The passage was lighted up with a bright flame."
"“是托普！”赫伯特喊道。","“It is Top!” cried Herbert."
"真的是托普，一只漂亮的盎格鲁-诺曼杂种狗，它从祖先身上同时继承了速度敏捷、嗅觉灵敏的优点，这些都是猎狗最优秀的特质。它的主人就是工程师——赛勒斯·哈丁先生。可是，现在只有它自己！纳布和他的主人都没有和它在一起！","It was indeed Top, a magnificent Anglo-Norman, who derived from these two races crossed the swiftness of foot and the acuteness of smell which are the preeminent qualities of coursing dogs.It was the dog of the engineer, Cyrus Harding.But he was alone!Neither Neb nor his master accompanied him!"
"它的直觉是怎么直接把它引到“石窟”来的？它可不知道这个地方。特别是，外头这么黑，还刮着暴风雨，这似乎太难以解释了！但更令人无法解释的是，托普不累，也不疲惫，全身甚至被泥或沙子弄脏！赫伯特唤它到身边来，拍着它的头，托普把脖子轻轻地在孩子的手上摩挲着。","How was it that his instinct had guided him straight to the Chimneys, which he did not know?It appeared inexplicable, above all, in the midst of this black night and in such a tempest!But what was still more inexplicable was, that Top was neither tired, nor exhausted, nor even soiled with mud or sand!—Herbert had drawn him towards him, and was patting his head, the dog rubbing his neck against the lad’s hands."
"“狗找到了，狗的主人也可以找到！”记者说。","“If the dog is found, the master will be found also!” said the reporter."
"“上帝保佑！”赫伯特回答，“我们出发吧！托普会为我们领路的！”","“God grant it!” responded Herbert.“Let us set off!Top will guide us!”"
"潘克洛夫没有反对。他觉得，托普的到来推翻了他的猜测。“那就走吧！”他说道。","Pencroft did not make any objection.He felt that Top’s arrival contradicted his conjectures.“Come along then!” said he."
"潘克洛夫小心地把炉架上的木炭盖好。又往里加了几块木柴，好让火能一直维持到他们回来的时候。然后，托普走在前面，急急地叫了几声，似乎在邀请大伙跟着它走，潘克洛夫用手帕把剩下的晚餐包好，跟着狗冲了出去，记者和孩子跟在后面。","Pencroft carefully covered the embers on the hearth.He placed a few pieces of wood among them, so as to keep in the fire until their return.Then, preceded by the dog, who seemed to invite them by short barks to come with him, and followed by the reporter and the boy, he dashed out, after having put up in his handkerchief the remains of the supper."
"暴风雨此刻凶猛无比，可能正是最厉害的时候。透过云层，看不见一丝月光。想直线前进是不可能的。最好是依靠托普的直觉了。他们这样做了。记者和赫伯特紧跟在狗的后面，水手走在最末。三个人之间不可能说话。虽说雨并不太大，风还是很猛烈。","The storm was then in all its violence, and perhaps at its height.Not a single ray of light from the moon pierced through the clouds.To follow a straight course was difficult.It was best to rely on Top’s instinct.They did so.The reporter and Herbert walked behind the dog, and the sailor brought up the rear.It was impossible to exchange a word.The rain was not very heavy, but the wind was terrific."
"不过，有一件事情倒是对水手和他的同伴们有利。风是从东南方向吹来的，这样一来，就吹在他们的后背上。如果风从相反方向吹来，扬起的沙尘会让他们难以承受，但吹在背后，就不会阻碍他们的进程。简而言之，他们有时不由自主地快步走，要稳住脚步都很困难，然而希望赋予了他们力量，因为，这一次他们在海岸前行有了清晰的目标。他们毫不怀疑纳布已经找到了主人，他才打发这条忠实的狗来找他们。可是工程师还活着吗？还是纳布只是把同伴们叫来，使他们能给不幸的哈丁遗体尽上最后一份职责？","However, one circumstance favored the seaman and his two companions.The wind being southeast, consequently blew on their backs.The clouds of sand, which otherwise would have been insupportable, from being received behind, did not in consequence impede their progress.In short, they sometimes went faster than they liked, and had some difficulty in keeping their feet; but hope gave them strength, for it was not at random that they made their way along the shore.They had no doubt that Neb had found his master, and that he had sent them the faithful dog.But was the engineer living, or had Neb only sent for his companions that they might render the last duties to the corpse of the unfortunate Harding?"
"过了悬崖，赫伯特、记者和潘克洛夫都小心翼翼地站到一边，停下来喘息。岩石的拐角为他们挡住了狂风，。经过了这段跋涉，更准确地说是15分钟的奔跑，他们终于可以喘口气了。","After having passed the precipice, Herbert, the reporter, and Pencroft prudently stepped aside to stop and take breath.The turn of the rocks sheltered them from the wind, and they could breathe after this walk or rather run of a quarter of an hour."
"他们现在可以听到对方说话，也可以作出回应了。孩子刚提到“赛勒斯·哈丁”的名字，托普就发出几声短促的叫声，好像在说它的主人已经获救了。","They could now hear and reply to each other, and the lad having pronounced the name of Cyrus Harding, Top gave a few short barks, as much as to say that his master was saved."
"“他得救了，不是吗？”赫伯特反复说着，“是不是得救了，托普？”","“Saved, isn’t he?” repeated Herbert; “saved, Top?”"
"托普叫了几声，表示回答。","And the dog barked in reply."
"他们再一次出发了。海水开始涨潮，在狂风的推动下，潮水可能涨得异乎寻常的高，这是春潮了。滔天巨浪发出轰隆声，如此狠劲地拍打着礁石，以至于整个小岛好像都被淹没了，在此刻他们完全看不见。海岸不再有防波堤保护，直接暴露在大海的袭击之下。","They once more set out.The tide began to rise, and urged by the wind it threatened to be unusually high, as it was a spring tide.Great billows thundered against the reef with such violence that they probably passed entirely over the islet, then quite invisible.The mole no longer protected the coast, which was directly exposed to the attacks of the open sea."
"水手和同伴们刚一离开悬崖，狂风卷土重来，对他们又展开了攻势。尽管被风吹得弯下了腰，他们还是走得很快，托普在前面，没有犹豫往哪个方向走。","As soon as the sailor and his companions left the precipice, the wind struck them again with renewed fury.Though bent under the gale they walked very quickly, following Top, who did not hesitate as to what direction to take."
"他们往北边走去，左边是无边无际的滔滔巨浪，发出震耳欲聋的响声，右边是一片漆黑的陆地，猜不出是什么样子。但他们觉得这块土地相对平坦，因为风完全从他们头顶上吹过，没有像吹到悬崖那样又折回来。","They ascended towards the north, having on their left an interminable extent of billows, which broke with a deafening noise, and on their right a dark country, the aspect of which it was impossible to guess.But they felt that it was comparatively flat, for the wind passed completely over them, without being driven back as it was when it came in contact with the cliff."
"早上四点钟的时候，他们估算大概已经走了五英里路。云稍稍上升了，风不那么潮湿了，但依然凛冽、寒冷。因为身上的衣物不够防寒，潘克洛夫、赫伯特和史佩莱都冻得难受，但谁也没抱怨一声。他们决定就跟在托普后面，不管这个机灵的畜生想把他们领到什么地方。","At four o’clock in the morning, they reckoned that they had cleared about five miles.The clouds were slightly raised, and the wind, though less damp, was very sharp and cold.Insufficiently protected by their clothing, Pencroft, Herbert and Spilett suffered cruelly, but not a complaint escaped their lips.They were determined to follow Top, wherever the intelligent animal wished to lead them."
"将近五点的时候，天开始亮了。头顶上的雾相对较薄，云周围有一道道阴影。在一片晦暗的天空下，一道亮光清楚地将地平线标志出来。巨浪的尖顶上闪烁着强烈的白光，泡沫又重新变成白花花的。同时，左边丘陵状的海岸也看得见了，虽然不是很清楚。","Towards five o’clock day began to break.At the zenith, where the fog was less thick, gray shades bordered the clouds; under an opaque belt, a luminous line clearly traced the horizon.The crests of the billows were tipped with a wild light, and the foam regained its whiteness.At the same time on the left the hilly parts of the coast could be seen, though very indistinctly."
"六点时，天已经完全亮了。云层迅速上升。水手和同伴们此时已经离“石窟”约有六英里了。他们现在正沿着平坦的海岸前进，边界上是礁石，几乎没有露出水面，因为它们在深深的海水里。左边的陆地看起来像一大片广阔的沙丘，蓟草林立。这里没有悬崖，除了一连串形状不规则的小丘外，海岸上没有任何屏障。不时会冒出两三棵树，一律朝西倾斜着，它们的枝丫也朝着这个方向伸展。在西南方向，森林的边缘伸向很远的地方。","At six o’clock day had broken.The clouds rapidly lifted.The seaman and his companions were then about six miles from the Chimneys.They were following a very flat shore bounded by a reef of rocks, whose heads scarcely emerged from the sea, for they were in deep water.On the left, the country appeared to be one vast extent of sandy downs, bristling with thistles.There was no cliff, and the shore offered no resistance to the ocean but a chain of irregular hillocks.Here and there grew two or three trees, inclined towards the west, their branches projecting in that direction.Quite behind, in the southwest, extended the border of the forest."
"这时，托普变得非常兴奋。它跑到前面，又折回来，像是在请求大伙加快脚步。然后，它离开了海滩，靠着非凡的直觉，毫不迟疑地径直跑进了那片沙丘。他们跟在后面。这一带好似荒漠一般。看不见一个生灵。","At this moment, Top became very excited.He ran forward, then returned, and seemed to entreat them to hasten their steps.The dog then left the beach, and guided by his wonderful instinct, without showing the least hesitation, went straight in among the downs.They followed him.The country appeared an absolute desert.Not a living creature was to be seen."
"这片沙丘面积很大，杂乱无章地分布着小丘，甚至还有小山。整片地形像瑞士在沙中的模型，也只有具备令人惊叹的直觉才可能找到路。","The downs, the extent of which was large, were composed of hillocks and even of hills, very irregularly distributed.They resembled a Switzerland modeled in sand, and only an amazing instinct could have possibly recognized the way."
"离开海岸五分钟后，记者和两个同伴到了一个类似山洞的地方，这是从一个很高的土堆后面挖空的。托普在这里停住了，发出清楚、响亮的叫声。史佩莱、赫伯特和潘克洛夫冲进了山洞。","Five minutes after having left the beach, the reporter and his two companions arrived at a sort of excavation, hollowed out at the back of a high mound.There Top stopped, and gave a loud, clear bark.Spilett, Herbert, and Pencroft dashed into the cave."
"一个人直挺挺地躺在草席上，纳布正跪在旁边。","Neb was there, kneeling beside a body extended on a bed of grass."
"那人正是工程师——赛勒斯·哈丁。","The body was that of the engineer, Cyrus Harding."
"第八章","Chapter 8"
"纳布一动不动。潘克洛夫只大声地问了一句。","Neb did not move.Pencroft only uttered one word."
"“还活着？”他喊道。","“Living?” he cried."
"纳布没有回答他。史佩莱和水手的脸色顿时变得惨白。赫伯特紧握双手，呆呆地站在那里。可怜的黑人陷入极度的悲痛之中，显然没有看见他的同伴，也没有听见水手的话。","Neb did not reply.Spilett and the sailor turned pale.Herbert clasped his hands, and remained motionless.The poor Negro, absorbed in his grief, evidently had neither seen his companions nor heard the sailor speak."
"记者跪在工程师一动不动的身体旁边，先解开他的衣服，然后把耳朵贴在他的胸前。","The reporter knelt down beside the motionless body, and placed his ear to the engineer’s chest, having first torn open his clothes."
"一分钟过去了，好像一个世纪那么漫长！在这期间，他努力听着，想听到哪怕是极其微弱的心跳。","A minute—an age!—passed, during which he endeavored to catch the faintest throb of the heart."
"纳布微微站直了身子，凝视了片刻，却什么也没有看见。绝望完全改变了他的面容。纳布筋疲力尽，伤心欲绝，人们几乎认不出他了。他以为他的主人已经死了。","Neb had raised himself a little and gazed without seeing.Despair had completely changed his countenance.He could scarcely be recognized, exhausted with fatigue, broken with grief.He believed his master was dead."
"经过一番长时间的仔细检查之后，吉丁·史佩莱终于站了起来。","Gideon Spilett at last rose, after a long and attentive examination."
"“还活着！”他说。","“He lives!” said he."
"潘克洛夫赶紧跪到工程师旁边，他也听到了心跳声，他的脸颊甚至还感觉到微弱的呼吸。","Pencroft knelt in his turn beside the engineer, he also heard a throbbing, and even felt a slight breath on his cheek."
"赫伯特听到记者的话后，跑出去找水。他在100英尺外发现了一条清澈的小溪，似乎是因为下雨，水上涨了很多，沙粒把溪水过滤得干干净净。但是他找不到容器来装水，沙丘上甚至连一个贝壳都没有。男孩只好把他的手帕浸泡在溪水里，然后捧着手帕急速地跑回山洞。","Herbert at a word from the reporter ran out to look for water.He found, a hundred feet off, a limpid stream, which seemed to have been greatly increased by the rains, and which filtered through the sand; but nothing in which to put the water, not even a shell among the downs.The lad was obliged to content himself with dipping his handkerchief in the stream, and with it hastened back to the grotto."
"好在湿手帕足够吉丁·史佩莱用的了，他只想把工程师的嘴唇润湿。冷水几乎立刻就产生了作用。工程师的胸部开始上下起伏，似乎有话要说。","Happily the wet handkerchief was enough for Gideon Spilett, who only wished to wet the engineer’s lips.The cold water produced an almost immediate effect.His chest heaved and he seemed to try to speak."
"“我们必须要救活他！”记者大声地说。","“We will save him!” exclaimed the reporter."
"听了这句话，纳布心里的希望又振奋起来。他解开了主人的衣服，检查他是否受伤。令人奇怪的是，他的头部、躯干和四肢都找不到一点伤痕。原以为他一定是撞在了石头上，可是连他的手都没有受伤，这就很难解释他是怎么到达破浪拍打不到的地方，而身上没有一点痕迹。","At these words hope revived in Neb’s heart.He undressed his master to see if he was wounded, but not so much as a bruise was to be found, either on the head, body, or limbs, which was surprising, as he must have been dashed against the rocks; even the hands were uninjured, and it was difficult to explain how the engineer showed no traces of the efforts which he must have made to get out of reach of the breakers."
"不过他们之后就能知道答案。等赛勒斯能说话的时候，他会告诉大家发生了什么。现在的问题是怎样才能使他苏醒过来，看上去按摩可能起到这种效果，于是他们开始用水手的运动衫给他按摩。","But the explanation would come later.When Cyrus was able to speak he would say what had happened.For the present the question was, how to recall him to life, and it appeared likely that rubbing would bring this about; so they set to work with the sailor’s jersey."
"经过剧烈的按摩，工程师苏醒了，他微微地动了下胳膊，呼吸也逐渐恢复正常。他由于筋疲力竭，有些虚脱。可以肯定的是，要不是记者和他的同伴们及时赶到，赛勒斯·哈丁就活不过来了。","The engineer, revived by this rude shampooing, moved his arm slightly and began to breathe more regularly.He was sinking from exhaustion, and certainly, had not the reporter and his companions arrived, it would have been all over with Cyrus Harding."
"“你以为你的主人死了，是不是？”水手对纳布说。","“You thought your master was dead, didn’t you?” said the seaman to Neb."
"“是的！我以为他死了！”纳布答道，“要不是托普找到了你们，并把你们带到这里，我应该已经把主人埋了，然后死在他的坟上了！”","“Yes! quite dead!” replied Neb, “and if Top had not found you, and brought you here, I should have buried my master, and then have lain down on his grave to die!”"
"对于赛勒斯·哈丁来说，这可真是死里逃生！","It had indeed been a narrow escape for Cyrus Harding!"
"于是纳布讲述了事情的经过。前一天的黎明时分，他离开了“石窟”，沿着海岸朝北方的高处走，一直走到他曾经去过的那一带海岸。","Neb then recounted what had happened.The day before, after having left the Chimneys at daybreak, he had ascended the coast in a northerly direction, and had reached that part of the shore which he had already visited."
"纳布承认，他在那里没有抱任何希望，找遍了海岸、岩石堆和沙滩，只为得到能引导他的一点点线索。他尤为仔细地检查了那些涨潮时海水冲不到的地方，因为靠海的一带，潮水总是会把所有的痕迹都冲刷掉。纳布并没有指望能找到活着的主人。他只想找到主人的遗骸，好亲手安葬他！","There, without any hope he acknowledged, Neb had searched the beach, among the rocks, on the sand, for the smallest trace to guide him.He examined particularly that part of the beach which was not covered by the high tide, for near the sea the water would have obliterated all marks.Neb did not expect to find his master living.It was for a corpse that he searched, a corpse which he wished to bury with his own hands!"
"他找了很久，没有一点结果。这片荒凉的海岸好像从来没有人类到访的痕迹。海水冲不到的高水位线处，布满了成百万的贝壳，都没有被人碰过。没有一个贝壳是破损的。","He sought long in vain.This desert coast appeared never to have been visited by a human creature.The shells, those which the sea had not reached, and which might be met with by millions above high-water mark, were untouched.Not a shell was broken."
"于是纳布决定沿着海岸再走几英里。可能海浪把尸体冲到很远的地方去了。通常，如果尸体在低海岸附近漂着的话，迟早会被潮水卷到岸上来。纳布清楚这一点，他希望能和他的主人见上最后一面。","Neb then resolved to walk along the beach for some miles.It was possible that the waves had carried the body to quite a distant point.When a corpse floats a little distance from a low shore, it rarely happens that the tide does not throw it up, sooner or later.This Neb knew, and he wished to see his master again for the last time."
"“我沿着海岸又走了两英里，无论是高水位处还是低水位处，我都仔细地检查了一遍，但是一无所获，我已经绝望了。可就在昨天晚上五点钟左右，我看见沙滩上有脚印。”","“I went along the coast for another two miles, carefully examining the beach, both at high and low water, and I had despaired of finding anything, when yesterday, above five in the evening, I saw footprints on the sand.”"
"“脚印？”潘克洛夫大声地说。","“Footprints?” exclaimed Pencroft."
"“是的！”纳布答道。","“Yes!” replied Neb."
"“这些脚印是从水边开始的吗？”记者问。","“Did these footprints begin at the water’s edge?” asked the reporter."
"“不是，”纳布回答，“都在高水位线附近之上，其他的肯定都被潮水冲掉了。”","“No,” replied Neb, “only above high-water mark, for the others must have been washed out by the tide.”"
"“接着说吧，纳布。”史佩莱说。","“Go on, Neb,” said Spilett."
"“看见这些脚印，我简直快要乐疯了。脚印非常清晰，一直到沙丘那边。我顺着脚印跑了四分之一英里，并留心不要破坏了它们。五分钟之后，天渐渐地黑了，我听见了狗的叫声。是托普，是它把我带到了这里，带到了我的主人身边！”","“I went half crazy when I saw these footprints.They were very clear and went towards the downs.I followed them for a quarter of a mile, running, but taking care not to destroy them.Five minutes after, as it was getting dark, I heard the barking of a dog.It was Top, and Top brought me here, to my master!”"
"纳布最后说道，他找到这个毫无生气的躯体时是多么悲伤，他看来看去也没有发现任何生命的迹象。既然他找到主人的尸体，他希望主人能活着。他所有的努力都白费了。什么都做不了，他只有对这个他如此深爱的人尽自己最后的一次责任！这时纳布想起了他的同伴们。毫无疑问，他们肯定希望再看一眼这个不幸的人。托普就在那里。难道他信不过这个忠实的牲畜的智慧吗？纳布把记者的名字反复说了几遍，在他所有的同伴之中，托普最熟悉的就是通讯记者。","Neb ended his account by saying what had been his grief at finding the inanimate body, in which he vainly sought for the least sign of life.Now that he had found him dead he longed for him to be alive.All his efforts were useless!Nothing remained to be done but to render the last duties to the one whom he had loved so much!Neb then thought of his companions.They, no doubt, would wish to see the unfortunate man again.Top was there.Could he not rely on the sagacity of the faithful animal?Neb several times pronounced the name of the reporter, the one among his companions whom Top knew best."
"然后，他伸手指向南方，托普便朝着他指的方向跑去。","Then he pointed to the south, and the dog bounded off in the direction indicated to him."
"我们已经知道，托普是如何凭着它那被认为是不可思议的直觉找到他们的。","We have heard how, guided by an instinct which might be looked upon almost as supernatural, Top had found them."
"纳布的同伴们聚精会神地听着他的描述。","Neb’s companions had listened with great attention to this account."
"他们很难理解为什么赛勒斯·哈丁穿过乱石堆，努力从大浪中逃脱出来，身上却一道擦伤都没有。工程师如何走完从海岸到沙丘的山洞这一英里多的路，同样也是无法解释。","It was unaccountable to them how Cyrus Harding, after the efforts which he must have made to escape from the waves by crossing the rocks, had not received even a scratch.And what could not be explained either was how the engineer had managed to get to this cave in the downs, more than a mile from the shore."
"“照你这么说，纳布，”记者说，“不是你把主人带到这里来的？”","“So, Neb,” said the reporter, “it was not you who brought your master to this place.”"
"“不，不是我。”黑人答道。","“No, it was not I,” replied the Negro."
"“很显然，是上尉自己到这里来的。”潘克洛夫说。","“It’s very clear that the captain came here by himself,” said Pencroft."
"“事实固然很明显，”史佩莱说，“但这也太让人难以置信了！”","“It is clear in reality,” observed Spilett, “but it is not credible!”"
"事情的真相只有等工程师亲自来解释，他们必须要等到他可以开口说话。按摩使血液循环重新畅通。赛勒斯·哈丁的胳膊又动了一下，接着头动了一下，随后他说了谁也没听懂的几个字。","The explanation of this fact could only be produced from the engineer’s own lips, and they must wait for that till speech returned.Rubbing had re-established the circulation of the blood.Cyrus Harding moved his arm again, then his head, and a few incomprehensible words escaped him."
"纳布弯着身子和他说话，但是工程师似乎没有听见，依旧紧闭着双眼。大家只能通过他的动作知道他还活着，他的意识还没有完全清醒过来。","Neb, who was bending over him, spoke, but the engineer did not appear to hear, and his eyes remained closed.Life was only exhibited in him by movement, his senses had not as yet been restored."
"因为没有火，也没有取火的东西，潘克洛夫感到十分懊恼。不幸的是，他忘记把焦布带在身上，要不然撞击两块打火石，迸出的火花很容易就可以把焦布点着。工程师的口袋里什么东西都没有，只有坎肩口袋里有一块表。眼下必须把哈丁抬到“石窟”去，而且越快越好。在这一点上，大家的意见完全一致。","Pencroft much regretted not having either fire, or the means of procuring it, for he had, unfortunately, forgotten to bring the burnt linen, which would easily have ignited from the sparks produced by striking together two flints.As to the engineer’s pockets, they were entirely empty, except that of his waistcoat, which contained his watch.It was necessary to carry Harding to the Chimneys, and that as soon as possible.This was the opinion of all."
"这时，大家殷勤的照顾使工程师恢复了知觉，这比他们预计的要快了很多。用来润湿嘴唇的水使他逐渐苏醒过来。潘克洛夫想起带在身上的松鸡，想把鸡肉汁加在水里。赫伯特跑到海边去，带回了两个大蚌壳。水手把调好的水送到了工程师的嘴里，他睁开了眼睛，迫不及待地吞咽着。","Meanwhile, the care which was lavished on the engineer brought him back to consciousness sooner than they could have expected.The water with which they wetted his lips revived him gradually.Pencroft also thought of mixing with the water some moisture from the titra’s flesh which he had brought.Herbert ran to the beach and returned with two large bivalve shells.The sailor concocted something which he introduced between the lips of the engineer, who eagerly drinking it opened his eyes."
"纳布和通讯记者弯腰俯向他。","Neb and the reporter were leaning over him."
"“主人！主人！”纳布喊道。","“My master! my master!” cried Neb."
"工程师听见了叫声。他最先认出了纳布和史佩莱，然后认出其他两位同伴，并轻轻地握了他们的手。","The engineer heard him.He recognized Neb and Spilett, then his other two companions, and his hand slightly pressed theirs."
"他又说了几个字，可以看得出即便是在这样的时刻，他的大脑依旧没有停止思考。这一次大家听懂了他的话。毫无疑问，这就是刚才他想说的话。","A few words again escaped him, which showed what thoughts were, even then, troubling his brain.This time he was understood.Undoubtedly they were the same words he had before attempted to utter."
"“这是孤岛还是大陆？”他低声地说。","“Island or continent?” he murmured."
"“管他是不是大陆，”潘克洛夫急忙喊道，“我们有的是时间把这里看个遍，上尉！只要你还活着，其他的我们什么也不在乎。”","“Bother the continent,” cried Pencroft hastily; “there is time enough to see about that, captain! we don’t care for anything, provided you are living.”"
"工程师无力地点了点头，然后又渐渐睡了过去。","The engineer nodded faintly, and then appeased to sleep."
"他们没有去打扰他的睡眠，记者立即着手准备把哈丁抬到一个舒服一点的地方去。纳布、赫伯特和潘克洛夫离开了山洞，朝着一座突起的小山头走去，山顶有几棵歪歪扭扭的树。一路上，水手情不自禁地重复着：","They respected this sleep, and the reporter began immediately to make arrangements for transporting Harding to a more comfortable place.Neb, Herbert, and Pencroft left the cave and directed their steps towards a high mound crowned with a few distorted trees.On the way the sailor could not help repeating,—"
"“孤岛还是大陆？只剩下一口气了，还在考虑这个问题！真是个了不起的人啊！”","“Island or continent!To think of that, when at one’s last gasp!What a man!”"
"爬到了小山顶上后，潘克洛夫和两位同伴开始忙活起来。他们什么工具都没有，只好用手劈下一棵树上的主枝。这是一棵海枞树，已经快要枯死了。他们打算用这些树枝做一副担架，上面再铺些草和树叶，就能用它抬工程师了。","Arrived at the summit of the mound, Pencroft and his two companions set to work, with no other tools than their hands, to despoil of its principal branches a rather sickly tree, a sort of marine fir; with these branches they made a litter, on which, covered with grass and leaves, they could carry the engineer."
"他们花了大概40分钟把担架做好，十点钟的时候，他们回到了赛勒斯·哈丁身边，史佩莱一直都没有离开过他。","This occupied them nearly forty minutes, and it was ten o’clock when they returned to Cyrus Harding whom Spilett had not left."
"工程师刚好醒来，或者说是从昏睡中醒来，梦中，同伴们找到了他。他的脸色一直像死人那样惨白，直到这个时候才逐渐恢复血色。他稍微抬起了身，环顾四周，看上去是想问自己在什么地方。","The engineer was just awaking from the sleep, or rather from the drowsiness, in which they had found him.The color was returning to his cheeks, which till now had been as pale as death.He raised himself a little, looked around him, and appeared to ask where he was."
"“你听我说话的时候觉得累吗，赛勒斯？”记者问。","“Can you listen to me without fatigue, Cyrus?” asked the reporter."
"“不累。”工程师说。","“Yes,” replied the engineer."
"“在我看来，”水手说，“如果哈丁上尉再吃些松鸡冻，他听你说话肯定更省力点。我们有松鸡，上尉。”他一边说，一边给哈丁一些肉冻，这次他还加了一些鸡肉。","“It’s my opinion,” said the sailor, “that Captain Harding will be able to listen to you still better, if he will have some more grouse jelly,—for we have grouse, captain,” added he, presenting him with a little of this jelly, to which he this time added some of the flesh."
"赛勒斯·哈丁只吃了一点松鸡，剩下的由他的同伴们分着吃了，他们几个都饿坏了，这顿早饭不够他们吃的。","Cyrus Harding ate a little of the grouse, and the rest was divided among his companions, who found it but a meager breakfast, for they were suffering extremely from hunger."
"“对了！”水手说，“‘石窟’里面有足够的食物，你知道的，上尉，从这里下去，在南边我们有一座房子，里面有房间，有床，还有壁炉，食品室里有几十只鸟，我们的赫伯特管它们叫锦鸡。担架已经准备好了，等你恢复了力气，我们就把你抬回家。”","“Well!” said the sailor, “there is plenty of food at the Chimneys, for you must know, captain, that down there, in the south, we have a house, with rooms, beds, and fireplace, and in the pantry, several dozen of birds, which our Herbert calls couroucous.Your litter is ready, and as soon as you feel strong enough we will carry you home.”"
"“谢谢你，我的朋友，”工程师回答，“再等一两个钟头我们就动身。现在你说说吧，史佩莱。”","“Thanks, my friend,” replied the engineer; “wait another hour or two, and then we will set out.And now speak, Spilett.”"
"于是记者给他讲了前前后后发生的事情。只要是赛勒斯不知道的，他全都讲了一遍：气球是怎样最后一次下坠的，是怎样落在这片看上去像荒漠一样的陌生土地上（不管它是什么，孤岛还是大陆），他们是怎样发现“石窟”的，怎样寻找工程师的，他当然不忘讲述了纳布的一片赤诚之心，忠实的托普表现出来的智慧和一些其他的事情。","The reporter then told him all that had occurred.He recounted all the events with which Cyrus was unacquainted, the last fall of the balloon, the landing on this unknown land, which appeared a desert (whatever it was, whether island or continent), the discovery of the Chimneys, the search for him, not forgetting of course Neb’s devotion, the intelligence exhibited by the faithful Top, as well as many other matters."
"“可是，”哈丁问道，他的声音依旧很微弱，“不是你们把我从海岸上救起来的吗？”","“But,” asked Harding, in a still feeble voice, “you did not, then, pick me up on the beach?”"
"“不是。”通讯记者答道。","“No,” replied the reporter."
"“不是你们把我带到这个山洞里来的？”","“And did you not bring me to this cave?”"
"“不是。”","“No.”"
"“这个山洞离海有多远？”","“At what distance is this cave from the sea?”"
"“大概一英里，”潘克洛夫答道，“如果你感到惊讶，上尉，我们在这里看见你，感到同样奇怪！”","“About a mile,” replied Pencroft; “and if you are astonished, captain, we are not less surprised ourselves at seeing you in this place!”"
"“的确，”工程师说，这时他已经逐渐恢复过来了，对这些细节表现出极大的兴趣，“这的确太奇怪了！”","“Indeed,” said the engineer, who was recovering gradually, and who took great interest in these details, “indeed it is very singular!”"
"“可是，”水手接着说，“能告诉我们你被海水卷走之后都发生了什么事吗？”","“But,” resumed the sailor, “can you tell us what happened after you were carried off by the sea?”"
"赛勒斯·哈丁陷入沉思。他能记起的事情很少。大浪把他从气球网上卷到了海里。起初他下沉了几英寻。在回到水面的途中，他隐隐约约觉得有一个生物在旁边挣扎。是托普，它从气球上跳下来救他。他已经看不见气球了，因为减少了他和狗的重量，气球像箭一样飞走了。","Cyrus Harding considered.He knew very little.The wave had torn him from the balloon net.He sank at first several fathoms.On returning to the surface, in the half light, he felt a living creature struggling near him.It was Top, who had sprung to his help.He saw nothing of the balloon, which, lightened both of his weight and that of the dog, had darted away like an arrow."
"他掉在波涛汹涌的大海中，距离海岸至少有半英里。他奋力游着，尝试着和巨浪斗争。托普咬着他的衣服，使他露出水面，但是一股激流迎面而来，冲着他一直向北。在挣扎了半个钟头后，水流把他和托普拖进了大海深处。从那一刻直到他刚刚苏醒过来，发现自己躺在朋友的怀中，这期间发生的事情他什么都记不清了。","There he was, in the midst of the angry sea, at a distance which could not be less than half a mile from the shore.He attempted to struggle against the billows by swimming vigorously.Top held him up by his clothes; but a strong current seized him and drove him towards the north, and after half an hour of exertion, he sank, dragging Top with him into the depths.From that moment to the moment in which he recovered to find himself in the arms of his friends he remembered nothing."
"“不管怎样，”潘克洛夫说，“你肯定是被海水冲到了岸上，而且肯定还有力气走到了这里，因为纳布发现了你的脚印！”","“However,” remarked Pencroft, “you must have been thrown on to the beach, and you must have had strength to walk here, since Neb found your footmarks!”"
"“是的……当然……”工程师若有所思地回答，“你们在海岸上没有发现人类的痕迹吗？”","“Yes...of course replied the engineer, thoughtfully; “and you found no traces of human beings on this coast?”"
"“一丝痕迹都没有，”记者回答说，“再说，假使你真的遇到了什么人在紧要关头救了你，把你送过来，他为什么把你从海浪中救出来，又把你扔在这里呢？”","“Not a trace,” replied the reporter; “besides, if by chance you had met with some deliverer there, just in the nick of time, why should he have abandoned you after having saved you from the waves?”"
"“你说得没错，亲爱的史佩莱。告诉我，纳布，”工程师转向他的仆人，接着说道，“难道不是你……你会不会是一时失去了知觉……在那段时间……不，这太荒谬了……那里现在还有脚印吗？”哈丁问。","“You are right, my dear Spilett.Tell me, Neb,” added the engineer, turning to his servant, “it was not you who...you can’t have had a moment of unconsciousness...during which no, that’s absurd....Do any of the footsteps still remain?” asked Harding."
"“有的，主人，”纳布答道，“这里，入口的地方，小山背后，还有风雨吹打不到的地方。暴风雨把其他的都冲掉了。”","“Yes, master, replied Neb; “here, at the entrance, at the back of the mound, in a place sheltered from the rain and wind.The storm has destroyed the others.”"
"“潘克洛夫，”赛勒斯·哈丁说，“你能拿上我的鞋，去对照一下那些究竟是不是我的脚印吗？”","“Pencroft,” said Cyrus Harding, “will you take my shoe and see if it fits exactly to the footprints?”"
"水手照着工程师的要求去做了。纳布带着他和赫伯特去往有脚印的地方，赛勒斯对记者说：","The sailor did as the engineer requested.While he and Herbert, guided by Neb, went to the place where the footprints were to be found, Cyrus remarked to the reporter,—"
"“这件事实在是太奇怪了！”","“It is a most extraordinary thing!”"
"“完全无法解释！”吉丁·史佩莱答道。","“Perfectly inexplicable!” replied Gideon Spilett."
"“现在先别说这件事了，亲爱的史佩莱，我们以后再谈吧。”","“But do not dwell upon it just now, my dear Spilett, we will talk about it by-and-by.”"
"过了一会儿，其他人走了进来。","A moment after the others entered."
"这件事情毫无疑问了。工程师的鞋和脚印完全吻合。因此，沙滩上的这些脚印就是赛勒斯·哈丁斯留下的。","There was no doubt about it.The engineer’s shoe fitted exactly to the footmarks.It was therefore Cyrus Harding who had left them on the sand."
"“好吧，”他说，“刚才我还认为纳布失去了知觉，现在看来，失去知觉的肯定是我自己了。我肯定像个梦游者似的，不知道我自己的步子，一定是托普把我从海浪中拉了上来，然后把我带到这儿来的……过来，托普！过来，老伙计！”","“Come,” said he, “I must have experienced this unconsciousness which I attributed to Neb.I must have walked like a somnambulist, without any knowledge of my steps, and Top must have guided me here, after having dragged me from the waves...Come, Top!Come, old dog!”"
"这头出色的牲畜叫着，跳到了它的主人身边，哈丁毫不吝啬地爱抚了它一番。大家一致同意，除此之外没有别的理由可以解释赛勒斯·哈丁是如何得救的，这件事情完全归功于托普。","The magnificent animal bounded barking to his master, and caresses were lavished on him.It was agreed that there was no other way of accounting for the rescue of Cyrus Harding, and that Top deserved all the honor of the affair."
"快到十二点的时候，潘克洛夫问工程师，他们现在可不可以把他抬走。哈丁没有回答，却凭着坚强的意志，一卯劲站了起来。可是他不得不靠在水手身上，不然他就会摔倒了。","Towards twelve o’clock, Pencroft having asked the engineer if they could now remove him, Harding, instead of replying, and by an effort which exhibited the most energetic will, got up.But he was obliged to lean on the sailor, or he would have fallen."
"“太好了！”潘克洛夫喊道，“快把上尉的担架抬过来。”","“Well done!” cried Pencroft; “bring the captain’s litter.”"
"担架抬来了，横向排列的树枝上铺着树叶和长草。哈丁躺在上面，潘克洛夫和纳布各抬着担架的一头，就这样开始向海岸走去。要走八英里的路，但是，因为他们不能走快，而且又可能必须经常停下休息，所以他们估计至少要六个钟头才能走到“石窟”。风依旧很大，所幸这时已经不下雨了。工程师虽然躺在担架上，但是他还是用手肘撑着身子，观察着海岸，特别是内陆地区。他没有说话，两眼注视着周围，毫无疑问，这片土地的外貌，包括高低不平的地势、森林和各种物产，都印在了他的脑海中。然而，走了两个钟头之后，疲惫不堪的他睡着了。","The litter was brought; the transverse branches had been covered with leaves and long grass.Harding was laid on it, and Pencroft, having taken his place at one end and Neb at the other, they started towards the coast.There was a distance of eight miles to be accomplished; but, as they could not go fast, and it would perhaps be necessary to stop frequently, they reckoned that it would take at least six hours to reach the Chimneys.The wind was still strong, but fortunately it did not rain.Although lying down, the engineer, leaning on his elbow, observed the coast, particularly inland.He did not speak, but he gazed; and, no doubt, the appearance of the country, with its inequalities of ground, its forests, its various productions, were impressed on his mind.However, after traveling for two hours, fatigue overcame him, and he slept."
"五点半的时候，这一小队人马走到了悬崖边，不久之后就到了“石窟”。","At half-past five the little band arrived at the precipice, and a short time after at the Chimneys."
"他们停了下来，把担架放在了沙上，此时赛勒斯·哈丁在熟睡中，还没有醒过来。","They stopped, and the litter was placed on the sand; Cyrus Harding was sleeping profoundly, and did not awake."
"令潘克洛夫大为吃惊的是，可怕的暴风雨已经使这里的面貌改变了很多。这里发生了巨大的变化，沙滩上有很多大块的石头，上面覆盖着一层厚厚的水草、海藻和其他冲上岸的植物。很显然，海水曾经漫过小岛，一直冲到巨大的花岗石壁底下。山洞前的泥土已经被汹涌的海浪冲走了。一种可怕的预感在潘克洛夫的脑子里一闪而过。他急忙冲到通道里，但马上又回来了，他一动不动地站在那里，盯着他的同伴们……火已经灭了，被水泡过的灰烬成了一滩泥，用来当火绒使的焦布不见了！海水已经流到了通道的最深处，“石窟”里的所有东西都被水冲倒、破坏了。","Pencroft, to his extreme surprise, found that the terrible storm had quite altered the aspect of the place.Important changes had occurred; great blocks of stone lay on the beach, which was also covered with a thick carpet of sea-weed, algae, and wrack.Evidently the sea, passing over the islet, had been carried right up to the foot of the enormous curtain of granite.The soil in front of the cave had been torn away by the violence of the waves.A horrid presentiment flashed across Pencroft’s mind.He rushed into the passage, but returned almost immediately, and stood motionless, staring at his companions....The fire was out; the drowned cinders were nothing but mud; the burnt linen, which was to have served as tinder, had disappeared!The sea had penetrated to the end of the passages, and everything was overthrown and destroyed in the interior of the Chimneys!"
"第九章","Chapter 9"
"总之，吉迪恩·史佩莱、赫伯特和纳布都知道发生了什么事。这次意外，在潘克洛夫看来是极其严重的，而忠实的水手的伙伴们则有不同的反应。","In a few words, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, and Neb were made acquainted with what had happened.This accident, which appeared so very serious to Pencroft, produced different effects on the companions of the honest sailor."
"纳布沉浸在找到主人的欢喜中，根本没听，或者说是不愿意因为潘克洛夫说的事情费心。","Neb, in his delight at having found his master, did not listen, or rather, did not care to trouble himself with what Pencroft was saying."
"赫伯特多少和水手有同感。","Herbert shared in some degree the sailor’s feelings."
"至于记者，他只是简单地说：","As to the reporter, he simply replied,—"
"“说实在的，潘克洛夫，我一点儿也不在乎！”","“Upon my word, Pencroft, it’s perfectly indifferent to me!”"
"“但是，我要重申，我们没有火了！”","“But, I repeat, that we haven’t any fire!”"
"“呸！”","“Pooh!”"
"“也没有任何办法再生火了！”","“Nor any means of relighting it!”"
"“胡说！”","“Nonsense!”"
"“但是我要说，史佩莱先生……”","“But I say, Mr. Spilett—”"
"“赛勒斯不是在这里吗？”记者答道。","“Isn’t Cyrus here?” replied the reporter."
"“我们的工程师不是活着吗？他很快会想办法给我们取火的！”","“Is not our engineer alive?He will soon find some way of making fire for us!”"
"“用什么？”","“With what?”"
"“什么也不用。”","“With nothing.”"
"潘克洛夫还有什么好说的？他没有什么好说的了，因为他打心底里和伙伴们一样相信赛勒斯·哈丁。在他们心目中，工程师就是个小宇宙，是一切科学的综合，通晓人类全部的智慧。和赛勒斯呆在荒岛上，也比独自在美国最繁荣的城市里要好。有了他就什么也不缺了，有了他就永远不会绝望。假如有人告诉这几个勇敢的人，火山喷发将要摧毁这块陆地，它要下沉到太平洋深处，他们会镇静地回答：","What had Pencroft to say?He could say nothing, for, in the bottom of his heart he shared the confidence which his companions had in Cyrus Harding.The engineer was to them a microcosm, a compound of every science, a possessor of all human knowledge.It was better to be with Cyrus in a desert island, than without him in the most flourishing town in the United States.With him they could want nothing; with him they would never despair.If these brave men had been told that a volcanic eruption would destroy the land, that this land would be engulfed in the depths of the Pacific, they would have imperturbably replied,—"
"“赛勒斯在这儿！”","“Cyrus is here!”"
"然而，由于一路上经受的颠簸，工程师躺在担架上，又一次陷入无意识状态，因此他们没法求助于他的智慧。晚餐只能将就吃一点。事实上，松鸡肉已经吃光了，现在又没有办法烹调其他的猎物。并且贮存的锦鸡也不见了。他们必须考虑下一步应该怎么办。","While in the palanquin, however, the engineer had again relapsed into unconsciousness, which the jolting to which he had been subjected during his journey had brought on, so that they could not now appeal to his ingenuity.The supper must necessarily be very meager.In fact, all the grouse flesh had been consumed, and there no longer existed any means of cooking more game.Besides, the couroucous which had been reserved had disappeared.They must consider what was to be done."
"首先，他们把赛勒斯·哈丁抬到过道中央。在那里，他们用比较干的海藻给他铺了一张床。熟睡可以使工程师很快恢复体力，这无疑比吃任何营养品都更有好处。","First of all, Cyrus Harding was carried into the central passage.There they managed to arrange for him a couch of sea-weed which still remained almost dry.The deep sleep which had overpowered him would no doubt be more beneficial to him than any nourishment."
"黑夜降临了，风向转为东北方向，气温也随之降低，又变得十分寒冷。海水冲毁了潘克洛夫在过道上分成的隔间，由于寒风直灌进来，这个石洞里几乎不能住人了。要不是伙伴们没把自己的外套和坎肩小心地盖在工程师的身上，他的情况就更加糟糕了。","Night had closed in, and the temperature, which had modified when the wind shifted to the northwest, again became extremely cold.Also, the sea having destroyed the partitions which Pencroft had put up in certain places in the passages, the Chimneys, on account of the draughts, had become scarcely habitable.The engineer’s condition would, therefore, have been bad enough, if his companions had not carefully covered him with their coats and waistcoats."
"赫伯特和纳布从海滩上捡了一大堆茨蟹，它们当然是晚餐的主角。然而，除了这些软体动物外，男孩从高处的岩石上搜集到一些可以食用的海藻，只有涨潮的时候，海水才冲得到这些高处的岩壁。这种海藻，是一种昆布，属于马尾藻类，晒干后产生一种胶状物质，营养极其丰富。记者和他的伙伴们吃了很多茨蟹，又吸了一些昆布的汁，味道还很不错。东方一些地带的居民经常吃这种食物。“不用担心！”水手说道，“上尉很快就可以帮助我们了。”这时天气更冷了，更糟糕的是，他们没有任何御寒的办法。","Supper, this evening, was of course composed of the inevitable lithodomes, of which Herbert and Neb picked up a plentiful supply on the beach.However, to these molluscs, the lad added some edible sea-weed, which he gathered on high rocks, whose sides were only washed by the sea at the time of high tides.This sea-weed, which belongs to the order of Fucacae, of the genus Sargassum, produces, when dry, a gelatinous matter, rich and nutritious.The reporter and his companions, after having eaten a quantity of lithodomes, sucked the sargassum, of which the taste was very tolerable.It is used in parts of the East very considerably by the natives.“Never mind!” said the sailor, “the captain will help us soon.”Meanwhile the cold became very severe, and unhappily they had no means of defending themselves from it."
"水手十分焦急，试遍了各种取火的方法。纳布也来帮忙。他找来一些干燥的苔藓，用两块鹅卵石砸出火星来，但是苔藓不易燃，点不着，这种火星虽然明亮耀眼，却不像击打火石迸发出来的火星那么持久稳定。因此，试验没有成功。","The sailor, extremely vexed, tried in all sorts of ways to procure fire.Neb helped him in this work.He found some dry moss, and by striking together two pebbles he obtained some sparks, but the moss, not being inflammable enough, did not take fire, for the sparks were really only incandescent, and not at all of the same consistency as those which are emitted from flint when struck in the same manner.The experiment, therefore, did not succeed."
"虽然潘克洛夫对这种做法毫无信心，可他还是照着原始人的做法，拿着两块干木头摩擦起来。按照新的理论，他和纳布所做的运动如果转化为热能，就足以烧开汽轮上的锅炉了！但是，他们的努力并没有奏效。木块虽然磨热了，可是要与这两位试验者身上的热量相比，简直是小巫见大巫。","Pencroft, although he had no confidence in the proceeding, then tried rubbing two pieces of dry wood together, as savages do.Certainly, the movement which he and Neb exhibited, if it had been transformed into heat, according to the new theory, would have been enough to heat the boiler of a steamer!It came to nothing.The bits of wood became hot, to be sure, but much less so than the operators themselves."
"干了一个小时后，潘克洛夫大汗淋漓，厌恶地把木块扔在地上。","After working an hour, Pencroft, who was in a complete state of perspiration, threw down the pieces of wood in disgust."
"“不管他们怎么说，我怎么也不相信原始人是用这种方法取火的，”他大叫道，“再摩擦下去我的胳膊要着火了！”","“I can never be made to believe that savages light their fires in this way, let them say what they will,” he exclaimed.“I could sooner light my arms by rubbing them against each other!”"
"水手看不起摩擦取火这种办法确实错了。原始人就是经常快速摩擦来点燃木头的。但不是任何木头都可以摩擦起火。此外，除了一般的方法，还有一个“诀窍”，潘克洛夫大概不懂这个“诀窍”。","The sailor was wrong to despise the proceeding.Savages often kindle wood by means of rapid rubbing.But every sort of wood does not answer for the purpose, and besides, there is “the knack,” following the usual expression, and it is probable that Pencroft had not “the knack.”"
"潘克洛夫的坏脾气并没有持续多久。赫伯特捡起潘克洛夫扔下的木块，用力摩擦起来。这个强壮的水手看见少年继续干着他已经失败的事，忍不住大笑起来。","Pencroft’s ill humor did not last long.Herbert had taken the bits of wood which he had turned down, and was exerting himself to rub them.The hardy sailor could not restrain a burst of laughter on seeing the efforts of the lad to succeed where he had failed."
"“摩吧，孩子，摩吧！”他说。","“Rub, my boy, rub!” said he."
"“我是在摩，”赫伯特笑着说，“但我不是想做别的，只是想让身体暖和一点儿，不至于瑟瑟发抖，我一会儿就会和你一样热了，我的好潘克洛夫！”","“I am rubbing,” replied Herbert, laughing, “but I don’t pretend to do anything else but warm myself instead of shivering, and soon I shall be as hot as you are, my good Pencroft!”"
"不一会儿，少年身体暖和起来了。但是，他们不得不放弃，至少是在今天晚上，他们不再尝试取火了。吉迪恩·史佩莱重复了至少20次，因为他觉得不能为这一点小困难去打扰赛勒斯·哈丁。这时，他躺到一个通道的沙床上，伸展开来。赫伯特、纳布和潘克洛夫也躺了下来，托普睡到它主人的脚边。","This soon happened.However, they were obliged to give up, for this night at least, the attempt to procure fire.Gideon Spilett repeated, for the twentieth time, that Cyrus Harding would not have been troubled for so small a difficulty.And, in the meantime, he stretched himself in one of the passages on his bed of sand.Herbert, Neb, and Pencroft did the same, while Top slept at his master’s feet."
"第二天是3月28日，大约早上八点时，工程师醒了，他看见伙伴们都围在周围看着他，还是像前一天一样，他开口便问：","Next day, the 28th of March, when the engineer awoke, about eight in the morning, he saw his companions around him watching his sleep, and, as on the day before, his first words were:—"
"“我们在荒岛还是大陆？”这对他来说最为重要。","“Island or continent?”This was his uppermost thought."
"“哦！”潘克洛夫答道，“我们一点也不清楚，上尉！”","“Well!” replied Pencroft, “we don’t know anything about it, captain!”"
"“你们还不知道？”","“You don’t know yet?”"
"潘克洛夫又说道：“等你带我们去内陆后，我们就知道了。”","“But we shall know,” rejoined Pencroft, “when you have guided us into the country.”"
"“我想我可以试试。”工程师说着，毫不费力地就站了起来。","“I think I am able to try it,” replied the engineer, who, without much effort, rose and stood upright."
"“这才是最重要的！”水手大声喊道。","“That’s capital!” cried the sailor."
"“我觉得非常虚弱，”哈丁说道，“朋友们，给我点吃的，我不久就会恢复过来。你们有火，对吗？”","“I feel dreadfully weak,” replied Harding.“Give me something to eat, my friends, and it will soon go off.You have fire, haven’t you?”"
"他们没有立即回答他。但是，几秒钟后——","This question was not immediately replied to.But, in a few seconds—"
"“哎！我们没有火，”潘克洛夫说，“更准确地说，上尉，我们再也没火了。”","“Alas! we have no fire,” said Pencroft, “or rather, captain, we have it no longer!”"
"水手把前一天发生的事向赛勒斯详细叙述了一遍。他给工程师讲了那仅有的一根火柴的趣事，然后又说了他试图用原始人的方法取火，但未能成功。","And the sailor recounted all that had passed the day before.He amused the engineer by the history of the single match, then his abortive attempt to procure fire in the savages’ way."
"“我们来仔细想想，”工程师说道，“如果我们找不到跟火绒差不多的东西……”","“We shall consider,” replied the engineer, “and if we do not find some substance similar to tinder—”"
"“那么？”水手问道。","“Well?” asked the sailor."
"“那么，我们可以做火柴。”","“Well, we will make matches."
"“化学火柴吗？”","“Chemicals?”"
"“化学火柴！”","“Chemicals!”"
"“这并不比昨天你做的事更难。”记者拍了拍水手的肩膀，大声说道。","“It is not more difficult than that,” cried the reporter, striking the sailor on the shoulder."
"水手并不认为这件事这么简单，但是他并没有反驳。所有人都出去了。天气变得风和日丽。太阳正从地平线上升起来，高大的悬崖上，一层层岩石被阳光照得金灿灿的。","The latter did not think it so simple, but he did not protest.All went out.The weather had become very fine.The sun was rising from the sea’s horizon, and touched with golden spangles the prismatic rugosities of the huge precipice."
"工程师迅速环顾四周，在一块石头上坐下来。赫伯特给他一些蛤蜊和马尾藻，对他说：","Having thrown a rapid glance around him, the engineer seated himself on a block of stone.Herbert offered him a few handfuls of shell-fish and sargassum, saying,—"
"“我们只有这些了，哈丁上尉。”","“It is all that we have, Captain Harding.”"
"“谢谢你，孩子，”哈丁答道，“这就够了……起码够今天早晨吃了。”","“Thanks, my boy,” replied Harding; “it will do—for this morning at least.”"
"他津津有味地吃着这些糟糕的食物，用大贝壳从河里舀过来一些淡水，喝几口咽下这些食物。","He ate the wretched food with appetite, and washed it down with a little fresh water, drawn from the river in an immense shell."
"他的伙伴们默默地看着他。过一会儿，赛勒斯·哈丁感觉精神恢复了一些，交叉着双臂说：","His companions looked at him without speaking.Then, feeling somewhat refreshed, Cyrus Harding crossed his arms, and said,—"
"“那么，我的朋友们，你们还不知道命运把我们扔到了一个荒岛上还是大陆上，是吗？”","“So, my friends, you do not know yet whether fate has thrown us on an island, or on a continent?”"
"“是的，上尉。”少年回答他。","“No, captain,” replied the boy."
"“明天我们就知道了，”工程师说，“到那时就没有别的事做了。”","“We shall know to-morrow,” said the engineer; “till then, there is nothing to be done.”"
"“有。”潘克洛夫答道。","“Yes,” replied Pencroft."
"“什么？”","“What?”"
"“取火。”水手说，水手一直对这件事念念不忘。","“Fire,” said the sailor, who, also, had a fixed idea."
"“我们会取到火的，潘克洛夫。”哈丁说。","“We will make it, Pencroft,” replied Harding."
"“你们昨天抬着我的时候，是不是看见西边有一座山可以俯瞰这片土地？”","“While you were carrying me yesterday, did I not see in the west a mountain which commands the country?”"
"“是的，”史佩莱答道，“那座山肯定相当高……”","“Yes,” replied Spilett, “a mountain which must be rather high—”"
"“好吧，”工程师说，“明天我们就爬到山顶上去，那时候我们就可以看到这片土地是荒岛还是大陆了。我再重复一遍，到那时，就没有事干了。”","“Well,” replied the engineer, “we will climb to the summit to-morrow, and then we shall see if this land is an island or a continent.Till then, I repeat, there is nothing to be done.”"
"“有，取火！”水手再次倔强地说。","“Yes, fire!” said the obstinate sailor again."
"“他会给我们取火的！”吉迪恩·史佩莱说道，“耐心点，潘克洛夫！”","“But he will make us a fire!” replied Gideon Spilett, “only have a little patience, Pencroft!”"
"水手看了史佩莱一眼，似乎在说：“如果靠你取火的话，我们就别想马上吃上烤肉了。”可是他什么也没说。","The seaman looked at Spilett in a way which seemed to say, “If it depended upon you to do it, we wouldn’t taste roast meat very soon”; but he was silent."
"这时，哈丁上尉没有做任何回答。他好像一点也不为取火的事发愁。他沉思了好几分钟，然后说：","Meanwhile Captain Harding had made no reply.He appeared to be very little troubled by the question of fire.For a few minutes he remained absorbed in thought; then again speaking,—"
"“我的朋友们，”他说，“我们的处境也许悲惨，但是无论如何，事情很明显。我们所处的地方，不是大陆，就是岛屿。如果这是大陆，我们就可以找到有人居住的地方，只不过是花费力气多少的问题而已。如果是在荒岛上，假如岛上有人，我们可以在岛上居民的帮助下脱离困境，如果岛上没有人，我们只好靠自己逃出去了。”","“My friends,” said he, “our situation is, perhaps, deplorable; but, at any rate, it is very plain.Either we are on a continent, and then, at the expense of greater or less fatigue, we shall reach some inhabited place, or we are on an island.In the latter case, if the island is inhabited, we will try to get out of the scrape with the help of its inhabitants; if it is desert, we will try to get out of the scrape by ourselves.”"
"“当然，这是再明显不过的事情了。”潘克洛夫说。","“Certainly, nothing could be plainer,” replied Pencroft."
"“可是，不管是荒岛还是大陆，”吉迪恩·史佩莱问道，“赛勒斯，你认为风暴把我们扔到什么地方了？”","“But, whether it is an island or a continent,” asked Gideon Spilett, “whereabouts do you think, Cyrus, this storm has thrown us?”"
"“我也说不准，”工程师答道，“我猜是太平洋的某块陆地。事实上，我们离开里士满时，刮的是东北风，风力很强，这说明风向应该没有改变。如果一路上风一直是从东北吹向西南，那么我们就飞过了北卡罗莱纳州、南卡罗莱纳州、佐治亚州、墨西哥湾、墨西哥本土的狭窄地带，然后到了太平洋的某个地方。我估计热气球至少飞出六、七千英里了。即使风向改变了45度，我们也一定被带到了曼达瓦群岛，或者帕摩图群岛，或者，如果风力比我猜想的还要大，那么可能会到了新西兰。如果是到了新西兰，我们就能轻而易举地回家了。无论是英国人还是毛利人，我们总能找到交流的人。假如事情正好相反，从山顶俯瞰四周，看到这是个小群岛中的荒岛，那时我们永远也出不去了，就要考虑在这里好好住下来了。”","“I cannot say exactly,” replied the engineer, “but I presume it is some land in the Pacific.In fact, when we left Richmond, the wind was blowing from the northeast, and its very violence greatly proves that it could not have varied.If the direction has been maintained from the northeast to the southwest, we have traversed the States of North Carolina, of South Carolina, of Georgia, the Gulf of Mexico, Mexico, itself, in its narrow part, then a part of the Pacific Ocean.I cannot estimate the distance traversed by the balloon at less than six to seven thousand miles, and, even supposing that the wind had varied half a quarter, it must have brought us either to the archipelago of Mendava, either on the Pomotous, or even, if it had a greater strength than I suppose, to the land of New Zealand.If the last hypothesis is correct, it will be easy enough to get home again.English or Maoris, we shall always find some one to whom we can speak.If, on the contrary, this is the coast of a desert island in some tiny archipelago, perhaps we shall be able to reconnoiter it from the summit of that peak which overlooks the country, and then we shall see how best to establish ourselves here as if we are never to go away.”"
"“永远？”记者喊道，“你说‘永远’，我亲爱的赛勒斯？”","“Never?” cried the reporter.“You say ‘Never,’ my dear Cyrus?”"
"“开始的时候最好做最坏的打算，”工程师答道，“把最好的结果留作一个惊喜。”","“Better to put things at the worst at first,” replied the engineer, “and reserve the best for a surprise.”"
"“说得对，”潘克洛夫说道，“如果这是个孤岛的话，我希望它不在船只的航线以外，要是那样就太倒霉了！”","“Well said,” remarked Pencroft.“It is to be hoped, too, that this island, if it be one, is not situated just out of the course of ships; that would be really unlucky!”"
"“在没有到达山顶之前，真不知道该指望什么。”工程师说。","“We shall not know what we have to rely on until we have first made the ascent of the mountain,” replied the engineer."
"“但是明天，上尉，”赫伯特问道，“明天上山您不会觉得疲惫吗？”","“But to-morrow, captain,” asked Herbert, “shall you be in a state to bear the fatigue of the ascent?”"
"“我希望可以，”工程师回答说，“孩子，这要看你和潘克洛夫是不是反应迅速、聪明机灵的猎人了。”","“I hope so,” replied the engineer, “provided you and Pencroft, my boy, show yourselves quick and clever hunters.”"
"“上尉，”水手说，“既然您说到猎物，那么我能保证，回来的时候，只要能烤，我就能把野味带回来……”","“Captain,” said the sailor, “since you are speaking of game, if on my return, I was as certain of roasting it as I am of bringing it back—”"
"“还是先把猎物搞到手吧，潘克洛夫。”哈丁说。","“Bring it back all the same, Pencroft,” replied Harding."
"大家最后达成一致，工程师和记者留在“石窟”里，观察海岸和上面的高地。纳布、赫伯特和水手返回森林，一方面，继续搜寻木柴以作储备，另一方面，只要遇到动物，不管飞禽走兽，到手就抓。","It was then agreed that the engineer and the reporter were to pass the day at the Chimneys, so as to examine the shore and the upper plateau.Neb, Herbert, and the sailor were to return to the forest, renew their store of wood, and lay violent hands on every creature, feathered or hairy, which might come within their reach."
"于是，早上十点钟左右，他们出发了。赫伯特信心十足，纳布兴致勃勃，潘克洛夫在一旁低声说：","They set out accordingly about ten o’clock in the morning, Herbert confident, Neb joyous, Pencroft murmuring aside,—"
"“如果我回来后发现有火，我肯定那是雷电点燃的。”三个人爬上了河岸，他们走到河流拐角时，水手停住脚步对他的两个伙伴说：","“If, on my return, I find a fire at the house, I shall believe that the thunder itself came to light it.”All three climbed the bank; and arrived at the angle made by the river, the sailor, stopping, said to his two companions,—"
"“我们是先打猎还是先找木柴？”","“Shall we begin by being hunters or wood-men?”"
"“打猎，”赫伯特答道，“托普已经在搜寻猎物了。”","“Hunters,” replied Herbert.“There is Top already in quest.”"
"“那我们就先打猎吧，”水手说，“然后我们再回来捡木柴。”","“We will hunt, then,” said the sailor, “and afterwards we can come back and collect our wood.”"
"大家达成一致后，赫伯特、纳布和潘克洛夫就从一棵小枞树的主干上掰下三根粗枝，在深草丛中跳来跳去的托普跟在后面。","This agreed to, Herbert, Neb, and Pencroft, after having torn three sticks from the trunk of a young fir, followed Top, who was bounding about among the long grass."
"这一次，猎人们没有顺着河道前进，而是直接进入了森林中心。这里的树木也是一样的，大部分属于松柏科。有些地方的树木比较稀疏，一丛一丛地长在一起，这些松树都很高大，从它们的生长情况来看，似乎这个地方的纬度比工程师想象的要高一些。林间的空地上有很多树桩，长年累月渐渐秃了，这里到处是干柴，简直有用不完的燃料。过了林间空地后，矮丛林逐渐变密，几乎穿不过去了。","This time, the hunters, instead of following the course of the river, plunged straight into the heart of the forest.There were still the same trees, belonging, for the most part, to the pine family.In certain places, less crowded, growing in clumps, these pines exhibited considerable dimensions, and appeared to indicate, by their development, that the country was situated in a higher latitude than the engineer had supposed.Glades, bristling with stumps worn away by time, were covered with dry wood, which formed an inexhaustible store of fuel.Then, the glade passed, the underwood thickened again, and became almost impenetrable."
"没有现成的路，在这片树林中想找条路走确实不容易。所以水手走几步就要折断树枝，这样回来时可以很容易辨认出路径来。但是这次他和赫伯特没有像第一次远足那样沿着河道走，也许是走错了路，走了一个小时，什么动物也没有看见。托普在树枝下乱跑，只遇到一些小鸟，还没走近，鸟就给惊飞了。就连锦鸡也没有看到，看情形水手只能回到森林的沼泽地去，上次他在那里兴致勃勃地展现了他的捕鸡技。","It was difficult enough to find the way among the groups of trees, without any beaten track.So the sailor from time to time broke off branches which might be easily recognized.But, perhaps, he was wrong not to follow the watercourse, as he and Herbert had done on their first excursion, for after walking an hour not a creature had shown itself.Top, running under the branches, only roused birds which could not be approached.Even the couroucous were invisible, and it was probable that the sailor would be obliged to return to the marshy part of the forest, in which he had so happily performed his grouse fishing."
"“潘克洛夫，”纳布略带讽刺的口吻说道，“假如这就是你答应带给我主人的猎物，那倒是不用多大的火来烤！”","“Well, Pencroft,” said Neb, in a slightly sarcastic tone, “if this is all the game which you promised to bring back to my master, it won’t need a large fire to roast it!”"
"“耐心一些，”水手回答，“回去之后，需要的恐怕不是猎物。”","“Have patience,” replied the sailor, “it isn’t the game which will be wanting on our return.”"
"“你难道对哈丁上尉没有信心吗？”","“Have you not confidence in Captain Harding?”"
"“是的。”","“Yes.”"
"“你不认为他会生起火来吗？”","“But you don’t believe that he will make fire?”"
"“等我看到木柴在炉子里燃烧，我才会相信。”","“I shall believe it when the wood is blazing in the fireplace.”"
"“既然我主人那样说，火一定会烧起来。”","“It will blaze, since my master has said so.”"
"“走着瞧吧！”","“We shall see!”"
"这时候，太阳还没有升到正当空。因此，他们继续搜寻。赫伯特发现一棵树上的果子可以吃，总算有些成果了。这是一棵石松，松子非常好吃，是欧美温带地区的珍品。这棵树上的松子正好熟透，大家一边尽情地吃着，一边听赫伯特讲。","Meanwhile, the sun had not reached the highest point in its course above the horizon.The exploration, therefore, continued, and was usefully marked by a discovery which Herbert made of a tree whose fruit was edible.This was the stone-pine, which produces an excellent almond, very much esteemed in the temperate regions of America and Europe.These almonds were in a perfect state of maturity, and Herbert described them to his companions, who feasted on them."
"“嗨，”潘克洛夫说，“拿海藻当面包，生蛤蜊当肉吃，松子当饭后点心，这对于口袋里没有一根火柴的我们，肯定是不错的一餐了！”","“Come,” said Pencroft, “sea-weed by way of bread, raw mussels for meat, and almonds for dessert, that’s certainly a good dinner for those who have not a single match in their pocket!”"
"“我们不应该抱怨。”赫伯特说。","We mustn’t complain,” said Herbert."
"“我不是在抱怨，孩子，”潘克洛夫回应道，“我只是重复一遍，这顿饭中肉太少了。”","“I am not complaining, my boy,” replied Pencroft, “only I repeat, that meat is a little too much economized in this sort of meal.”"
"“托普找到什么东西了！”纳布喊着，向树丛中奔去，托普已经钻到中间看不见的地方了，不停地叫着。托普的叫声中夹杂着一种奇怪的咕哝声。","“Top has found something!” cried Neb, who ran towards a thicket, in the midst of which the dog had disappeared, barking.With Top’s barking were mingled curious gruntings."
"水手和赫伯特紧跟着纳布跑过去。如果那里有什么猎物，现在应该考虑的是怎样抓住它，而不是讨论怎样烹调。","The sailor and Herbert had followed Neb.If there was game there this was not the time to discuss how it was to be cooked, but rather, how they were to get hold of it."
"猎人刚进入灌木丛，就看见托普和一个动物争斗着，咬着它的一只耳朵。这是个类似于猪的四足动物，近两英尺半长，身体呈黑褐色，肚子下的颜色较浅，浑身的毛又稀又硬。它的足趾紧紧按在地上，趾间似乎有蹼连接。赫伯特认出这种动物是水豚，是啮齿动物中最大的一种。","The hunters had scarcely entered the bushes when they saw Top engaged in a struggle with an animal which he was holding by the ear.This quadruped was a sort of pig nearly two feet and a half long, of a blackish brown color, lighter below, having hard scanty hair; its toes, then strongly fixed in the ground, seemed to be united by a membrane.Herbert recognized in this animal the capybara, that is to say, one of the largest members of the rodent order."
"这时，水豚并没有和狗争斗。它笨拙地转动着眼珠，眼睑很厚。也许这是它第一次见到人类。","Meanwhile, the capybara did not struggle against the dog.It stupidly rolled its eyes, deeply buried in a thick bed of fat.Perhaps it saw men for the first time."
"然而，纳布正握紧棍子想把它打倒，这时水豚却挣脱了托普的牙齿，因为托普只咬住了它的耳朵边。水豚发出了有力的一声，向赫伯特冲去，差点儿把他撞倒，然后消失在树林里。","However, Neb having tightened his grasp on his stick, was just going to fell the pig, when the latter, tearing itself from Top’s teeth, by which it was only held by the tip of its ear, uttered a vigorous grunt, rushed upon Herbert, almost overthrew him, and disappeared in the wood."
"“该死的畜生！”潘克洛夫喊道。","“The rascal!” cried Pencroft."
"三个人跟着托普快速追上去，可是他们刚赶上托普，水豚就跳到一个古松覆盖的大池子里了。","All three directly darted after Top, but at the moment when they joined him the animal had disappeared under the waters of a large pond shaded by venerable pines."
"纳布、赫伯特和潘克洛夫站住了，一动不动。托普纵身跳进水中，可是水豚躲在水底不出来。","Neb, Herbert, and Pencroft stopped, motionless.Top plunged into the water, but the capybara, hidden at the bottom of the pond, did not appear."
"“我们等等吧，”少年说，“它很快就要到水面上呼吸。”","“Let us wait,” said the boy, “for he will soon come to the surface to breathe.”"
"“它不会淹死吗？”纳布问道。","“Won’t he drown?” asked Neb."
"“不会的，”赫伯特回答说，“因为它长着蹼，几乎算是一种两栖动物。看住它。”","“No,” replied Herbert, “since he has webbed feet, and is almost an amphibious animal.But watch him.”"
"托普还是在水里。潘克洛夫和他的两个伙伴站在河边不同的地方，切断水豚的退路，托普在水面上寻找水豚。","Top remained in the water.Pencroft and his two companions went to different parts of the bank, so as to cut off the retreat of the capybara, which the dog was looking for beneath the water."
"赫伯特的话果然不错。没过几分钟，水豚就露出了水面。托普一下子跳到它身上，按住它不让它继续下沉。过了一会儿，水豚被拖到岸边，纳布一棍子就把它打死了。","Herbert was not mistaken.In a few minutes the animal appeared on the surface of the water.Top was upon it in a bound, and kept it from plunging again.An instant later the capybara, dragged to the bank, was killed by a blow from Neb’s stick."
"“哈哈！”潘克洛夫呼喊道，他总是第一个发出胜利的欢呼。","“Hurrah!” cried Pencroft, who was always ready with this cry of triumph."
"“只要给我火，就可以把这只猪啃得只剩骨头！”","“Give me but a good fire, and this pig shall be gnawed to the bones!”"
"潘克洛夫把水豚扛在肩上，他看了看太阳，估摸着有两点钟，就给出返回的手势。","Pencroft hoisted the capybara on his shoulders, and judging by the height of the sun that it was about two o’clock, he gave the signal to return."
"托普的直觉对猎人们很有帮助，多亏了这个聪明的家伙，他们才能找到回去的路。半小时后，他们到达了河边。","Top’s instinct was useful to the hunters, who, thanks to the intelligent animal, were enabled to discover the road by which they had come.Half an hour later they arrived at the river."
"如果没有火，一切都是徒劳。虽然如此，潘克洛夫像以前一样，很快做了一个木筏顺流而下，一直漂向“石窟”。","Pencroft soon made a raft of wood, as he had done before, though if there was no fire it would be a useless task, and the raft following the current, they returned towards the Chimneys."
"水手还没走50步就站住了，他指着悬崖的转角，扯开嗓门欢呼道：","But the sailor had not gone fifty paces when he stopped, and again uttering a tremendous hurrah, pointed towards the angle of the cliff,—"
"“赫伯特！纳布！快看！”他大喊道。","“Herbert!Neb!Look!” he shouted."
"只见岩石中，一缕轻烟袅袅升起。","Smoke was escaping and curling up among the rocks."
"第十章","Chapter 10"
"几分钟以后，三个猎人来到了噼啪作响的篝火前。上尉和记者就在旁边。潘克洛夫瞧瞧这个，望望那个，手里拿着水豚，一言不发。","In a few minutes the three hunters were before a crackling fire.The captain and the reporter were there.Pencroft looked from one to the other, his capybara in his hand, without saying a word."
"“不错吧，我的勇士。”记者喊道。","“Well, yes, my brave fellow,” cried the reporter."
"“火，真的是火，完全可以烤熟这只大肥猪，我们马上就可以美餐一顿了！”","“Fire, real fire, which will roast this splendid pig perfectly, and we will have a feast presently!”"
"“可这是谁生的火呢？”潘克洛夫问道。","“But who lighted it?” asked Pencroft."
"“太阳！”","“The sun!”"
"吉迪恩·史佩莱回答得很到位。这股热量竟是太阳提供的，这让潘克洛夫感到惊奇。水手简直不敢相信自己的眼睛，他太惊讶了，都没想到问问工程师。","Gideon Spilett was quite right in his reply.It was the sun which had furnished the heat which so astonished Pencroft.The sailor could scarcely believe his eyes, and he was so amazed that he did not think of questioning the engineer."
"“你有聚光镜吧？”赫伯特问哈丁。","“Had you a burning-glass, sir?” asked Herbert of Harding."
"“没有，孩子，”他答道，“可是我自己做了一个。”","“No, my boy,” replied he, “but I made one.”"
"于是他把自己做的聚光镜装备给大家看。仅仅是用了工程师和记者两块手表上的玻璃。工程师在两片玻璃中间注入水，用黏土把边缘粘在一起，就制成了一个正规的聚光镜，利用它将太阳光聚在干燥的地苔上，地苔很快燃烧起来。","And he showed the apparatus which served for a burning-glass.It was simply two glasses which he had taken from his own and the reporter’s watches.Having filled them with water and rendered their edges adhesive by means of a little clay, he thus fabricated a regular burning-glass, which, concentrating the solar rays on some very dry moss, soon caused it to blaze."
"水手细细打量了这个装备，然后凝视着工程师，一句话也不说，唯有从他的表情可以明显看出，在他的眼里，赛勒斯·哈丁即便不是一个奇才，也绝非普通人。终于他开口了，大声喊道：","The sailor considered the apparatus; then he gazed at the engineer without saying a word, only a look plainly expressed his opinion that if Cyrus Harding was not a magician, he was certainly no ordinary man.At last speech returned to him, and he cried,—"
"“记下来，史佩莱先生，记在你的本子上。”","“Note that, Mr. Spilett, note that down on your paper!”"
"“记下来了。”记者答道。","“It is noted,” replied the reporter."
"接着纳布协助水手准备了肉叉，好好清理了水豚，很快就在明亮、噼啪作响的篝火上像烤猪似的烤起水豚来。","Then, Neb helping him, the seaman arranged the spit, and the capybara, properly cleaned, was soon roasting like a suckling-pig before a clear, crackling fire."
"“石窟”里变得更加舒适，不仅因为有篝火温暖着过道，而且还有木头和泥巴重新建起的隔板。","The Chimneys had again become more habitable, not only because the passages were warmed by the fire, but because the partitions of wood and mud had been re-established."
"很明显，工程师和他的伙伴们这一天干得不错。赛勒斯·哈丁几乎完全恢复了体力，从他能爬上高地这点就能看出。他站在高地顶端，用他那擅长目测高度和距离的眼睛长时间地注视着山锥，他想明天爬到锥顶去。这座山坐落在西北方向，离这里大约六英里，据他估计，在海平面以上3500英尺。因此，如果一个观察者站在山顶上，视线可覆盖半径达五十英里的范围。因此，哈丁也就能轻易解决这里究竟是“荒岛还是大陆”的问题，这可是他非常关心的。","It was evident that the engineer and his companions had employed their day well.Cyrus Harding had almost entirely recovered his strength, and had proved it by climbing to the upper plateau.From this point his eye, accustomed to estimate heights and distances, was fixed for a long time on the cone, the summit of which he wished to reach the next day.The mountain, situated about six miles to the northwest, appeared to him to measure 3,500 feet above the level of the sea.Consequently the gaze of an observer posted on its summit would extend over a radius of at least fifty miles.Therefore it was probable that Harding could easily solve the question of “island or continent,” to which he attached so much importance."
"他们晚餐吃得丰盛至极。水豚肉的美味赢得了大家的一致赞赏。马尾藻和石松子让这顿晚餐锦上添花，吃饭的时候工程师很少讲话。他满心盘算着第二天的计划。","They supped capitally.The flesh of the capybara was declared excellent.The sargassum and the almonds of the stone-pine completed the repast, during which the engineer spoke little.He was preoccupied with projects for the next day."
"潘克洛夫有一两次提出一些想法，建议接下来最好怎么做。赛勒斯·哈丁虽然考虑问题明显很有条理，但他只是摇摇头，却不开口。","Once or twice Pencroft gave forth some ideas upon what it would be best to do; but Cyrus Harding, who was evidently of a methodical mind, only shook his head without uttering a word."
"“明天，”他重复道，“我们就知道应该指望什么了，然后采取相应行动。”","“To-morrow,” he repeated, “we shall know what we have to depend upon, and we will act accordingly.”"
"晚饭过后，他们又在篝火上添了新柴，“石窟”里的全体居民，包括忠诚的托普在内，很快进入了熟睡状态。","The meal ended, fresh armfuls of wood were thrown on the fire, and the inhabitants of the Chimneys, including the faithful Top, were soon buried in a deep sleep."
"这一夜平安无事，第二天是3月29号，他们从睡梦中醒来，精神饱满，准备开始决定他们命运的一次远征。","No incident disturbed this peaceful night, and the next day, the 29th of March, fresh and active they awoke, ready to undertake the excursion which must determine their fate."
"一切准备妥当。剩下的水豚肉足够哈丁和他的伙伴们吃上至少一昼夜。","All was ready for the start.The remains of the capybara would be enough to sustain Harding and his companions for at least twenty-four hours."
"另外，他们希望能在路上找到更多食物。放大镜上的玻璃又安回工程师和记者的表上，潘克洛夫烧了一些亚麻布，当作火绒取火。至于火石，在这种火成岩的地区是不会缺少的。早晨七点半，这些探险者带着木棍离开了“石窟。”大家同意了潘克洛夫的意见，走森林里已经开辟的小路似乎是最好的，回来时再寻别的路。这也是到高山去最直接的道路。他们转过南面的拐角，沿着河的左岸走，走到河流折向西南的地点，那里形成了一个急弯，然后就离开了河道。他们在常青树下找到旧路，九点钟的时候，赛勒斯·哈丁和他的伙伴们已经到达了森林的西部边缘。地面始终很少有起伏，起初尽是沼泽，然后是干燥的沙地，形成了缓坡，从岸边一直升起，直到陆地内部。森林里可以看见些胆小的动物。托普迅速地扑向它们，但是它的主人很快把它喊回来，因为现在还不是开始打猎的时候，要等到稍后再说。工程师可不是一个允许自己改变既定计划的人。甚至可以说他从不去观察这个地方，不管是地势，还是这里的自然物产，他的伟大目标是要登上眼前的这座高山，因此他就一直朝着那个方向前进。十点钟时，大家休息了几分钟。走出森林以后，高山的地势就呈现在这些探险者眼前。山有两个山锥，其中一个的锥顶好似被削过似的，高约2500英尺，被许多拱柱似的石头支撑着，好像一只巨爪站在地上，足趾撑开。峡谷镶嵌其间，谷里树木丛生，最后的一丛树木耸入较低的锥顶。面向东北的山坡似乎树木稀疏一些，可以看见一条条很深的罅隙，那毫无疑问是水道。","Besides, they hoped to find more food on the way.As the glasses had been returned to the watches of the engineer and reporter, Pencroft burned a little linen to serve as tinder.As to flint, that would not be wanting in these regions of Plutonic origin.It was half-past seven in the morning when the explorers, armed with sticks, left the Chimneys.Following Pencroft’s advice, it appeared best to take the road already traversed through the forest, and to return by another route.It was also the most direct way to reach the mountain.They turned the south angle and followed the left bank of the river, which was abandoned at the point where it formed an elbow towards the southwest.The path, already trodden under the evergreen trees, was found, and at nine o’clock Cyrus Harding and his companions had reached the western border of the forest.The ground, till then, very little undulated, boggy at first, dry and sandy afterwards, had a gentle slope, which ascended from the shore towards the interior of the country.A few very timid animals were seen under the forest-trees.Top quickly started them, but his master soon called him back, for the time had not come to commence hunting; that would be attended to later.The engineer was not a man who would allow himself to be diverted from his fixed idea.It might even have been said that he did not observe the country at all, either in its configuration or in its natural productions, his great aim being to climb the mountain before him, and therefore straight towards it he went.At ten o’clock a halt of a few minutes was made.On leaving the forest, the mountain system of the country appeared before the explorers.The mountain was composed of two cones; the first, truncated at a height of about two thousand five hundred feet, was sustained by buttresses, which appeared to branch out like the talons of an immense claw set on the ground.Between these were narrow valleys, bristling with trees, the last clumps of which rose to the top of the lowest cone.There appeared to be less vegetation on that side of the mountain which was exposed to the northeast, and deep fissures could be seen which, no doubt, were watercourses."
"第一个火山锥的上面还有另外一个，略呈弧形，稍稍斜向一边，像是一顶歪戴在头上的大圆帽。苏格兰人应该会这样形容：“他的无边呢帽怎么戴歪了。”这个火山锥看来全是由泥土构成，间或有红岩突出表面。","On the first cone rested a second, slightly rounded, and placed a little on one side, like a great round hat cocked over the ear.A Scotchman would have said, “His bonnet was a thocht ajee.”It appeared formed of bare earth, here and there pierced by reddish rocks."
"他们想爬上第二个山锥，沿着支脉的山脊爬上去看来是最好的方式了。","They wished to reach the second cone, and proceeding along the ridge of the spurs seemed to be the best way by which to gain it."
"“我们来到火山地带了。”赛勒斯·哈丁说完后，他的伙伴们跟着他，开始沿着一个支脉一步一步向上爬，这个支脉蜿蜒地通向第一个高地，因而走起来更容易些。","“We are on volcanic ground,” Cyrus Harding had said, and his companions following him began to ascend by degrees on the back of a spur, which, by a winding and consequently more accessible path, joined the first plateau."
"这里显然曾经经历过地震。到处可见乱石、大量的玄武岩和浮石的碎片。枞树三五成群地生长，几百尺以下的狭窄峡谷深处被茂密的树叶遮挡着，几乎透不进一丝阳光。","The ground had evidently been convulsed by subterranean force.Here and there stray blocks, numerous debris of basalt and pumice-stone, were met with.In isolated groups rose fir-trees, which, some hundred feet lower, at the bottom of the narrow gorges, formed massive shades almost impenetrable to the sun’s rays."
"爬山的第一阶段，赫伯特说到地上的足迹，能看出是一些庞大的动物最近留下的。","During the first part of the ascent, Herbert remarked on the footprints which indicated the recent passage of large animals."
"“也许这些野兽不愿意放我们过去。”潘克洛夫说。","“Perhaps these beasts will not let us pass by willingly,” said Pencroft."
"“是啊，”记者答道，他曾在印度打过虎，在非洲猎过狮，“我们很快就会学会如何应付它们的。但目前还是小心为上！”","“Well,” replied the reporter, who had already hunted the tiger in India, and the lion in Africa, “we shall soon learn how successfully to encounter them.But in the meantime we must be upon our guard!”"
"他们慢慢地爬上山去。","They ascended but slowly."
"道路曲折，障碍颇多，他们不能直接爬上去，因此，实际距离是很远的。有时，地面突然下降，他们走到近前才发现已临深渊，只好绕道而行。因此，他们折回原路，寻找可以通行的道路，用了大量时间，白白花了气力。十二点钟的时候，这一小队探险者在一大丛枞树底下停下吃饭，附近有一条山涧，流水顺流直下形成一个瀑布。他们发现离第一个高地还有一半的距离，天黑之前几乎不可能到达那里了。从这个角度看，海洋要辽阔得多，但是右边一个高耸的海角却挡住了他们的视线，没法看见那边是否有陆地。左边，视线可以延展到北方几英里以外，但是向西北方向他们居住的地方望去，视线就被一道山脊截住，那是一个形状奇特的山脊，构成了中央山锥的有力支撑。","The distance, increased by detours and obstacles which could not be surmounted directly, was long.Sometimes, too, the ground suddenly fell, and they found themselves on the edge of a deep chasm which they had to go round.Thus, in retracing their steps so as to find some practicable path, much time was employed and fatigue undergone for nothing.At twelve o’clock, when the small band of adventurers halted for breakfast at the foot of a large group of firs, near a little stream which fell in cascades, they found themselves still half way from the first plateau, which most probably they would not reach till nightfall.From this point the view of the sea was much extended, but on the right the high promontory prevented their seeing whether there was land beyond it.On the left, the sight extended several miles to the north; but, on the northwest, at the point occupied by the explorers, it was cut short by the ridge of a fantastically-shaped spur, which formed a powerful support of the central cone."
"一点钟的时候，他们继续爬山。他们斜着向西南方向行进，又走进了一片浓密的灌木丛。树阴下，几对雉科的鹌鸡类飞禽拍打着翅膀。它们是角雉，喉咙下悬着肉瓣，眼睛后面有一对圆形的小冠毛。这类飞禽和家鸡差不多大，雌鸟通身褐色，雄鸟羽衣鲜红，白色斑点点缀其间，非常绚丽。吉迪恩·史佩莱捡起一块石头，巧妙有力地投射出去，一下子就打死了一只角雉。潘克洛夫被新鲜的空气刺激了食欲，两眼贪婪地盯着它们。","At one o’clock the ascent was continued.They slanted more towards the southwest and again entered among thick bushes.There under the shade of the trees fluttered several couples of gallinaceae belonging to the pheasant species.They were tragopans, ornamented by a pendant skin which hangs over their throats, and by two small, round horns, planted behind the eyes.Among these birds, which were about the size of a fowl, the female was uniformly brown, while the male was gorgeous in his red plumage, decorated with white spots.Gideon Spilett, with a stone cleverly and vigorously thrown, killed one of these tragopans, on which Pencroft, made hungry by the fresh air, had cast greedy eyes."
"离开灌木丛地带，他们这一伙人相互搭着肩膀翻过了一段约100英尺的斜坡，来到了一片平地。此地树木稀疏，土壤好像是火山土质。爬这个斜坡需蜿蜒向上才比较容易，因为此处很陡峭，每一步都摇摇欲坠，必须十分谨慎小心。纳布和赫伯特在前，潘克洛夫在后，工程师和记者居中。此处有很多动物留下的痕迹，经常到这一高岗上来的动物一定是那些能够站得稳、脊骨柔软的羚羊或山羊。他们看见了几只，但是名字可不是潘克洛夫叫的那样，他突然大喊：“绵羊！”","After leaving the region of bushes, the party, assisted by resting on each other’s shoulders, climbed for about a hundred feet up a steep acclivity and reached a level place, with very few trees, where the soil appeared volcanic.It was necessary to ascend by zigzags to make the slope more easy, for it was very steep, and the footing being exceedingly precarious required the greatest caution.Neb and Herbert took the lead, Pencroft the rear, the captain and the reporter between them.The animals which frequented these heights—and there were numerous traces of them—must necessarily belong to those races of sure foot and supple spine, chamois or goat.Several were seen, but this was not the name Pencroft gave them, for all of a sudden—“Sheep!” he shouted."
"大家都停下脚步，50英尺开外的地方，有六只体形庞大的动物，它们的角强壮有力、向后弯曲、顶端扁平，蓬松的绒毛隐藏在黄褐色、光滑的长毛下。","All stopped about fifty feet from half-a-dozen animals of a large size, with strong horns bent back and flattened towards the point, with a woolly fleece, hidden under long silky hair of a tawny color."
"它们不是普通的绵羊，而是在温带山区常见的物种，赫伯特称其为摩弗仑羊。","They were not ordinary sheep, but a species usually found in the mountainous regions of the temperate zone, to which Herbert gave the name of the musmon."
"“那能把它们做成羊腿和羊排吗？”水手问道。","“Have they legs and chops?” asked the sailor."
"“能。”赫伯特回答。","“Yes,” replied Herbert."
"“好吧，那它们和绵羊有什么两样！”潘克洛夫说。","“Well, then, they are sheep!” said Pencroft."
"这些动物站立在大块的玄武岩中间，一动不动，诧异地盯着人们，好像是第一次看见人类这种二足动物。它们突然感到了恐惧，飞快地跨过山石，消失了。","The animals, motionless among the blocks of basalt, gazed with an astonished eye, as if they saw human bipeds for the first time.Then their fears suddenly aroused, they disappeared, bounding over the rocks."
"“再见了，改日再会。”潘克洛夫望着它们嚷嚷道，那滑稽的语调令赛勒斯·哈丁、吉迪恩·史佩莱、赫伯特和纳布都禁不住大笑。","“Good-bye, till we meet again,” cried Pencroft, as he watched them, in such a comical tone that Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, and Neb could not help laughing."
"他们继续登山。熔岩随处可见。有时含硫的泉水挡住了去路，他们只好绕道而行。有些地方，硫在其他物质中形成结晶，例如由无数小长石晶体构成的白色火山岩渣滓里。","The ascent was continued.Here and there were traces of lava.Sulphur springs sometimes stopped their way, and they had to go round them.In some places the sulphur had formed crystals among other substances, such as whitish cinders made of an infinity of little feldspar crystals."
"临近第一高地的时候，爬山已十分困难，高地是由较低的火山锥顶部削平而成。快到四点钟的时候，他们已走过最后一片林区。现在只是有几棵歪歪扭扭的矮松，它们长在如此高的地域显然很艰辛，时常要抵抗海上刮来的狂风。让工程师和他的伙伴们感到庆幸的是，天气晴好，气流平稳。如果在海拔3000英尺的地方，即使是一阵微风，也会阻挡他们攀行的脚步。大气纯净，天高云淡。周围一片静谧。他们看不见太阳，高火山锥笼罩了西方的半边水平线，挡住了太阳，山锥的庞大阴影延展至海滩，随着红日西坠，影子拉得愈来愈长。东方出现水汽——与其说是云，还不如说是雾，在阳光的照射下，呈现出绚丽夺目的光芒。这群探险者距离高地仅有500英尺，他们打算到那里扎营过夜，然而蜿蜒的道路使这500英尺的路程成了两英里多。他们脚下的土壤好像在往下滑。","In approaching the first plateau formed by the truncating of the lower cone, the difficulties of the ascent were very great.Towards four o’clock the extreme zone of the trees had been passed.There only remained here and there a few twisted, stunted pines, which must have had a hard life in resisting at this altitude the high winds from the open sea.Happily for the engineer and his companions the weather was beautiful, the atmosphere tranquil; for a high breeze at an elevation of three thousand feet would have hindered their proceedings.The purity of the sky at the zenith was felt through the transparent air.A perfect calm reigned around them.They could not see the sun, then hid by the vast screen of the upper cone, which masked the half-horizon of the west, and whose enormous shadow stretching to the shore increased as the radiant luminary sank in its diurnal course.Vapor—mist rather than clouds—began to appear in the east, and assume all the prismatic colors under the influence of the solar rays.Five hundred feet only separated the explorers from the plateau, which they wished to reach so as to establish there an encampment for the night, but these five hundred feet were increased to more than two miles by the zigzags which they had to describe.The soil, as it were, slid under their feet."
"这里的山坡大多很陡峭，经过风化的石头不能提供有力支撑，一踩上去就会滑落。夜幕渐临，赛勒斯·哈丁和他的伙伴们花了七个钟头，耗尽了力气，才爬上了第一个火山锥顶的高地，此时天几乎已经完全黑了。他们必须准备宿营，首先吃饭，然后睡觉，才能恢复体力。第二个火山锥底部有许多岩石，很容易找到安身之所。周围柴火不多。幸好，高地上的一些地方覆盖着地苔和干枯的灌木，可以用来生火。水手准备用石头围成一个火炉，纳布和赫伯特则忙着收集柴火。他们很快就满载着干柴归来。用火石打出火星，焦布沾到火星燃起来，纳布吹了几口气，几分钟后，在岩石的避风处，一团烈火噼啪作响地燃烧起来。他们生火的目的仅是为了抵御夜间的寒冷，既然不是为了烤鸟肉，纳布就把打来的鸟留到第二天。剩下的水豚肉和几十个石松松子就成了他们的晚餐。不到六点半，他们就吃完了晚餐。","The slope often presented such an angle that they slipped when the stones worn by the air did not give a sufficient support.Evening came on by degrees, and it was almost night when Cyrus Harding and his companions, much fatigued by an ascent of seven hours, arrived at the plateau of the first cone.It was then necessary to prepare an encampment, and to restore their strength by eating first and sleeping afterwards.This second stage of the mountain rose on a base of rocks, among which it would be easy to find a retreat.Fuel was not abundant.However, a fire could be made by means of the moss and dry brushwood, which covered certain parts of the plateau.While the sailor was preparing his hearth with stones which he put to this use, Neb and Herbert occupied themselves with getting a supply of fuel.They soon returned with a load of brushwood.The steel was struck, the burnt linen caught the sparks of flint, and, under Neb’s breath, a crackling fire showed itself in a few minutes under the shelter of the rocks.Their object in lighting a fire was only to enable them to withstand the cold temperature of the night, as it was not employed in cooking the bird, which Neb kept for the next day.The remains of the capybara and some dozens of the stone-pine almonds formed their supper.It was not half-past six when all was finished."
"赛勒斯·哈丁打算趁着半亮的天色，去观察一下支撑较高火山锥的圆形底层。在休息之前，他想先去了解一下，如果火山锥的周围过于陡峭无法爬到顶部，是不是有可能从它的底部绕行。这个问题占据了他的心神，从帽锥倾斜的方向看，也就是向北倾斜，高地可能无法走通。如果从这边没法爬上山顶，又不能从火山锥底部绕行到另外一边，也就无法观察西边的陆地了，那么他们登山的目标，在某种程度上是完全无法实现了。","Cyrus Harding then thought of exploring in the half-light the large circular layer which supported the upper cone of the mountain.Before taking any rest, he wished to know if it was possible to get round the base of the cone in the case of its sides being too steep and its summit being inaccessible.This question preoccupied him, for it was possible that from the way the hat inclined, that is to say, towards the north, the plateau was not practicable.Also, if the summit of the mountain could not be reached on one side, and if, on the other, they could not get round the base of the cone, it would be impossible to survey the western part of the country, and their object in making the ascent would in part be altogether unattained."
"因此，工程师留下潘克洛夫和纳布安排睡铺，吉迪恩·史佩莱记录当天发生的事情，自己则不顾疲惫，开始沿着高地的边沿往北走去。赫伯特陪在他的身边。","The engineer, accordingly, regardless of fatigue, leaving Pencroft and Neb to arrange the beds, and Gideon Spilett to note the incidents of the day, began to follow the edge of the plateau, going towards the north.Herbert accompanied him."
"夜色优美宁静，光线并不太暗。赛勒斯·哈丁和男孩紧挨着一起走，一句话也不说。高地的某些地方很开阔，他们没遇到阻碍顺利前行。有些地方被岩石挡住去路，只有一条小窄路，两人不能并排走过。走了20分钟，赛勒斯·哈丁和赫伯特不得不停下了脚步。此处两个火山锥的斜坡合为一处。没有山肩隔开山的两部分。斜坡将近70度，此路不通了。","The night was beautiful and still, the darkness was not yet deep.Cyrus Harding and the boy walked near each other, without speaking.In some places the plateau opened before them, and they passed without hindrance.In others, obstructed by rocks, there was only a narrow path, in which two persons could not walk abreast.After a walk of twenty minutes, Cyrus Harding and Herbert were obliged to stop.From this point the slope of the two cones became one.No shoulder here separated the two parts of the mountain.The slope, being inclined almost seventy degrees, the path became impracticable."
"但是，如果工程师和少年不得不放弃绕行的想法，他们反而有机会爬到火山锥顶了。","But if the engineer and the boy were obliged to give up thoughts of following a circular direction, in return an opportunity was given for ascending the cone."
"事实上，他们的面前有个深洞。那是高低不平的火山口，火山处于活动期时，喷发的液体物质曾经由此处喷出。凝固的熔岩和硬结的火山渣形成了天然的宽阶梯，这样爬到山顶就十分便利了。","In fact, before them opened a deep hollow.It was the rugged mouth of the crater, by which the eruptive liquid matter had escaped at the periods when the volcano was still in activity.Hardened lava and crusted scoria formed a sort of natural staircase of large steps, which would greatly facilitate the ascent to the summit of the mountain."
"哈丁匆匆瞥了一眼，毫不犹豫地进入了巨大的深洞，少年紧随其后。越往里走，光线愈暗。","Harding took all this in at a glance, and without hesitating, followed by the lad, he entered the enormous chasm in the midst of an increasing obscurity."
"距山顶还有1000英尺的距离。能不能顺着火山口的斜坡往里走呢？很快就能见分晓了。意志坚定的工程师决心继续登山，直到无法前行为止。幸运的是，斜坡一直顺着火山内部蜿蜒而上，他们俩顺利地爬了上去。","There was still a height of a thousand feet to overcome.Would the interior acclivities of the crater be practicable?It would soon be seen.The persevering engineer resolved to continue his ascent until he was stopped.Happily these acclivities wound up the interior of the volcano and favored their ascent."
"毫无疑问，这是一座死火山。没有一缕烟飘出，深洞里也没有一丝火光，没有轰隆声，也没有轻响，这口黑井甚至连一丝颤动也没有，也许一直通到地壳的深处。火山口的空气里没有硫磺水汽的味道。这不仅是一座沉睡的火山，还是一座完全熄灭了的死火山。赛勒斯·哈丁的计划可以成功了。","As to the volcano itself, it could not be doubted that it was completely extinct.No smoke escaped from its sides; not a flame could be seen in the dark hollows; not a roar, not a mutter, no trembling even issued from this black well, which perhaps reached far into the bowels of the earth.The atmosphere inside the crater was filled with no sulphurous vapor.It was more than the sleep of a volcano; it was its complete extinction.Cyrus Harding’s attempt would succeed."
"他和赫伯特一步步爬上内壁，头顶上的火山口越来越开阔。圆形天空的半径在火山锥的框架下越来越大。两位探险者每迈出一步，就有更多的星星进入他们的视线。南方天空的星座漫天闪耀。天蝎座的主星在上方熠熠发亮，不远处是人马座的阿尔法星，据说它是离地球最近的星星。然后，随着火山口不断扩大，又出现了南鱼座的北落师门和南三角座。最后，在接近南极的地方，南十字座闪耀星空，它的位置相当于北半球的北极星。","Little by little, Herbert and he climbing up the sides of the interior, saw the crater widen above their heads.The radius of this circular portion of the sky, framed by the edge of the cone, increased obviously.At each step, as it were, that the explorers made, fresh stars entered the field of their vision.The magnificent constellations of the southern sky shone resplendently.At the zenith glittered the splendid Antares in the Scorpion, and not far was Alpha Centauri, which is believed to be the nearest star to the terrestrial globe.Then, as the crater widened, appeared Fomalhaut of the Fish, the Southern Triangle, and lastly, nearly at the Antarctic Pole, the glittering Southern Cross, which replaces the Polar Star of the Northern Hemisphere."
"当赛勒斯·哈丁和赫伯特到达火山锥顶最高点时，已经将近晚上八点了。","It was nearly eight o’clock when Cyrus Harding and Herbert set foot on the highest ridge of the mountain at the summit of the cone."
"此时夜色漆黑，他们的视线无法看到两英里以外的地方。是大海包围着这块未知的陆地，还是西接着太平洋的某个大陆呢？此时无法得知。西方的水平线上，一条带状的云清晰可见，使这里显得愈加昏暗，肉眼无法判断海天是否在同一个圆圈里相接。","It was then perfectly dark, and their gaze could not extend over a radius of two miles.Did the sea surround this unknown land, or was it connected in the west with some continent of the Pacific?It could not yet be made out.Towards the west, a cloudy belt, clearly visible at the horizon, increased the gloom, and the eye could not discover if the sky and water were blended together in the same circular line."
"可是水平线上突然透出一丝微弱的光芒，随着乌云向头顶移动，光线慢慢投射向大地。","But at one point of the horizon a vague light suddenly appeared, which descended slowly in proportion as the cloud mounted to the zenith."
"是一弯新月正在西沉，但是它的光亮足以清楚地照亮水平线，乌云移开以后，工程师看见新月映在水面，倒影荡漾。赛勒斯·哈丁抓住少年的手，严肃地说：","It was the slender crescent moon, already almost disappearing; but its light was sufficient to show clearly the horizontal line, then detached from the cloud, and the engineer could see its reflection trembling for an instant on a liquid surface.Cyrus Harding seized the lad’s hand, and in a grave voice,—"
"“一个荒岛！”恰在这时，这弯新月消失在水波之下。","“An island!” said he, at the moment when the lunar crescent disappeared beneath the waves."
"第十一章","Chapter 11"
"半小时之后，赛勒斯·哈丁和赫伯特回到了宿营地。工程师仅告诉他的伙伴们，命运将他们扔到的地方是一个岛，明天他们将讨论这件事情。于是大家都尽力安定下来，在那个海拔2500英尺的山洞里，这些岛上的居民在静谧的夜中，安然地睡了一觉。","Half an hour later Cyrus Harding and Herbert had returned to the encampment.The engineer merely told his companions that the land upon which fate had thrown them was an island, and that the next day they would consult.Then each settled himself as well as he could to sleep, and in that rocky hole, at a height of two thousand five hundred feet above the level of the sea, through a peaceful night, the islanders enjoyed profound repose."
"第二天是3月30日，匆忙地吃过只有烤角雉的早餐，工程师想再去一次火山顶，以便更加细致地观察一下这个荒岛，如果荒岛离任何陆地都很远，或者在往来太平洋各群岛的航线之外，那么他们很有可能会困在岛上一辈子。这一次，他的伙伴们跟着他一起开始了新的探索。他们也想看看这个荒岛，因为他们还要依靠岛上的物产来满足生活所需。","The next day, the 30th of March, after a hasty breakfast, which consisted solely of the roasted tragopan, the engineer wished to climb again to the summit of the volcano, so as more attentively to survey the island upon which he and his companions were imprisoned for life perhaps, should the island be situated at a great distance from any land, or if it was out of the course of vessels which visited the archipelagoes of the Pacific Ocean.This time his companions followed him in the new exploration.They also wished to see the island, on the productions of which they must depend for the supply of all their wants."
"早晨七点左右，赛勒斯·哈丁、赫伯特、潘克洛夫和吉丁·史佩莱离开了宿营地。大家似乎并未对自己的处境感到焦虑。毫无疑问，他们相信自己，但是必须指明一点，哈丁和他的伙伴们的信心基础不一样。工程师有信心，是因为他认为能够在这片荒岛上获取他和伙伴们的一切生活所需，而伙伴们之所以毫无畏惧，是因为赛勒斯·哈丁与他们在一起。尤其是潘克洛夫，自从生火事件后，他不曾有过片刻的悲观失望，即使在一块光秃秃的石头上，只要工程师在他身边，他就无所畏惧。","It was about seven o’clock in the morning when Cyrus Harding, Herbert, Pencroft, Gideon Spilett, and Neb quitted the encampment.No one appeared to be anxious about their situation.They had faith in themselves, doubtless, but it must be observed that the basis of this faith was not the same with Harding as with his companions.The engineer had confidence, because he felt capable of extorting from this wild country everything necessary for the life of himself and his companions; the latter feared nothing, just because Cyrus Harding was with them.Pencroft especially, since the incident of the relighted fire, would not have despaired for an instant, even if he was on a bare rock, if the engineer was with him on the rock."
"“呸！”他说，“我们没有官方的许可，不也离开了里士满！更何况这里肯定没有人阻拦我们，想逃不出去都难！”","“Pshaw,” said he, “we left Richmond without permission from the authorities!It will be hard if we don’t manage to get away some day or other from a place where certainly no one will detain us!”"
"赛勒斯·哈丁循着前一晚走过的路行进。他们绕过火山堆，沿着形成山肩的高地向巨大的深洞走去。天气晴好。太阳高挂在晴空，阳光洒满整个东面的山。","Cyrus Harding followed the same road as the evening before.They went round the cone by the plateau which formed the shoulder, to the mouth of the enormous chasm.The weather was magnificent.The sun rose in a pure sky and flooded with his rays all the eastern side of the mountain."
"他们来到了火山口前。这里和工程师在夜间所辨认出的完全一致，也就是说，像一个巨大的漏斗由下至上延展，越来越宽，一直延伸到高地上方1000英尺的地方。洞口下方，一道道又宽又厚的熔岩顺着山的边缘蜿蜒而下，标记出当初火山喷发出的物质流向低谷的路径，使荒岛北部形成褶皱。","The crater was reached.It was just what the engineer had made it out to be in the dark; that is to say, a vast funnel which extended, widening, to a height of a thousand feet above the plateau.Below the chasm, large thick streaks of lava wound over the sides of the mountain, and thus marked the course of the eruptive matter to the lower valleys which furrowed the northern part of the island."
"火山口内部的斜坡不过35度到40度，对于爬山者来讲，构不成任何困难或障碍。古老的岩浆留下的痕迹依然可见，这些岩浆有可能是在旁边的洞口开出新道以前，从山顶溢出来的。","The interior of the crater, whose inclination did not exceed thirty five to forty degrees, presented no difficulties nor obstacles to the ascent.Traces of very ancient lava were noticed, which probably had overflowed the summit of the cone, before this lateral chasm had opened a new way to it."
"火山通道贯通了底层和火山口，因为火山隐藏在朦胧中，其深度无法目测。但是确定无疑的是，火山已完全熄灭。","As to the volcanic chimney which established a communication between the subterranean layers and the crater, its depth could not be calculated with the eye, for it was lost in obscurity.But there was no doubt as to the complete extinction of the volcano."
"八点之前，哈丁和他的伙伴们聚集到火山口顶端，站在北边隆起的锥形小丘上。","Before eight o’clock Harding and his companions were assembled at the summit of the crater, on a conical mound which swelled the northern edge."
"“大海，到处是海！”他们喊着，似乎他们的嘴唇不能阻止言语冒出来，这句话使他们成了岛上的居民。","“The sea, the sea everywhere!” they cried, as if their lips could not restrain the words which made islanders of them."
"的确，大海形成一望无际的环状水域围着他们！赛勒斯·哈丁也许原本心存希望，想再次爬上火山锥顶时能够发现某个海滨和岛岸，因为前一晚在黑暗中没能看清。然而，直到地平线的最远端也没有任何东西出现，也就是说，方圆50多英里内什么都没有。没有一片陆地。没有一叶孤帆。在这一望无际的空间里只有海洋是可见的，荒岛就占据着这个似乎无边无际的圆形中心。","The sea, indeed, formed an immense circular sheet of water all around them!Perhaps, on climbing again to the summit of the cone, Cyrus Harding had had a hope of discovering some coast, some island shore, which he had not been able to perceive in the dark the evening before.But nothing appeared on the farthest verge of the horizon, that is to say over a radius of more than fifty miles.No land in sight.Not a sail.Over all this immense space the ocean alone was visible—the island occupied the center of a circumference which appeared to be infinite."
"工程师和他的伙伴们默默地站在那里，一动不动，用几分钟时间仔细地观察了海洋的每一个方向，直到最远的边际。甚至连眼力好得出奇的潘克洛夫也没看见任何东西，如果水平线上有陆地，即使它像水汽一样模糊不清，水手也一定能发现，好像他的眉毛下天生就带着一副正规的望远镜。","The engineer and his companions, mute and motionless, surveyed for some minutes every point of the ocean, examining it to its most extreme limits.Even Pencroft, who possessed a marvelous power of sight, saw nothing; and certainly if there had been land at the horizon, if it appeared only as an indistinct vapor, the sailor would undoubtedly have found it out, for nature had placed regular telescopes under his eyebrows."
"他们的视线从海洋转移到能够俯瞰的整个荒岛，吉丁·史佩莱率先想到了一个问题：","From the ocean their gaze returned to the island which they commanded entirely, and the first question was put by Gideon Spilett in these terms:"
"“这个荒岛大概有多大？”","“About what size is this island?”"
"在这片广阔无际的海洋中间，它的确显得并不太大。","Truly, it did not appear large in the midst of the immense ocean."
"赛勒斯·哈丁思索了几分钟，他留心地观察了一下海岛四周，将自己所在位置的高度考虑在内，然后说：","Cyrus Harding reflected a few minutes; he attentively observed the perimeter of the island, taking into consideration the height at which he was placed; then,—"
"“朋友们，我想自己应该不会估计错误，这个海岛周长大概有100多英里。”","“My friends,” said he, “I do not think I am mistaken in giving to the shore of the island a circumference of more than a hundred miles.”"
"“那么面积有多大？”","“And consequently an area?”"
"“那很难估计，”工程师回答，“因为这个岛的地势太不平坦。”","“That is difficult to estimate,” replied the engineer, “for it is so uneven.”"
"如果赛勒斯·哈丁估计得正确，那么这个海岛几乎和地中海里德马耳他岛或赞得岛差不多大，但同时，这个岛的地势更为不规则，海角、地岬、地角、港湾和河流却更为稀少。奇怪的地形吸引了众人的目光，吉丁·史佩莱听从了工程师的建议，画下了海岛的轮廓，他们发现它很像某种奇异的动物，如同一只庞大的海怪平躺着，睡在太平洋的海面上。","If Cyrus Harding was not mistaken in his calculation, the island had almost the extent of Malta or Zante, in the Mediterranean, but it was at the same time much more irregular and less rich in capes, promontories, points, bays, or creeks.Its strange form caught the eye, and when Gideon Spilett, on the engineer’s advice, had drawn the outline, they found that it resembled some fantastic animal, a monstrous leviathan, which lay sleeping on the surface of the Pacific."
"海岛的形状确实如此，知道这点很重要，记者立刻就准确地勾勒出了海岛的一幅草图。","This was in fact the exact shape of the island, which it is of consequence to know, and a tolerably correct map of it was immediately drawn by the reporter."
"海岛的东岸形成一个开阔的海湾，这里就是落难者们登陆的地方，海湾尽头是一个突出的海角，潘克洛夫第一次探险的时候漏掉了这里，因为它被隆起的地角挡住了。东北方向有另外两个海角围着海湾，中间有一条狭长的海峡，看上去像是一只半张着下巴的恐怖角蛟。","The east part of the shore, where the castaways had landed, formed a wide bay, terminated by a sharp cape, which had been concealed by a high point from Pencroft on his first exploration.At the northeast two other capes closed the bay, and between them ran a narrow gulf, which looked like the half-open jaws of a formidable dog-fish."
"从东北到西北海岸呈弧形，如同动物的扁平头盖，接着海岸向上突起，高出地面一大块，但是这部分海岛并不像任何特定形状，海岛中间被火山占据。","From the northeast to the southwest the coast was rounded, like the flattened cranium of an animal, rising again, forming a sort of protuberance which did not give any particular shape to this part of the island, of which the center was occupied by the volcano."
"从这里开始，海岸从南到北十分规则，在沿岸三分之二处被一条很窄的小溪隔开，海岸在此处成了长尾形，好似短吻鳄的尾突。","From this point the shore ran pretty regularly north and south, broken at two-thirds of its perimeter by a narrow creek, from which it ended in a long tail, similar to the caudal appendage of a gigantic alligator."
"尾巴这里形成规则半岛，延伸到海里30多英里，是从已经提过的海岛东南海角算起的。半岛弯曲，形成一个开放的抛锚处，标记出这块形状奇特的海岛的低海岸部分。","This tail formed a regular peninsula, which stretched more than thirty miles into the sea, reckoning from the cape southeast of the island, already mentioned; it curled round, making an open roadstead, which marked out the lower shore of this strangely-formed land."
"海岛最狭窄的地方，也就是从“石窟”到同纬度的西海岸的小河之间，只有十英里远。然而，海岛最狭长的地带，也就是从东北的峡口到西南端的半岛尾部，距离至少有30英里。","At the narrowest part, that is to say between the Chimneys and the creek on the western shore, which corresponded to it in latitude, the island only measured ten miles; but its greatest length, from the jaws at the northeast to the extremity of the tail of the southwest, was not less than thirty miles."
"海岛内陆的情形大致是这样的，从高山到海岸的南部一带树木茂盛，北部则干燥多沙。在火山和东海岸之间，赛勒斯·哈丁和他的伙伴们惊异地发现一个湖泊，湖边还有许多常绿树木，这可出乎他们的预料。从山顶望去，湖面似乎和海面持平，但是工程师思索后向大家解释道，这片水域的高度一定在300英尺左右，因为湖泊在高地上，而高地是由海岸延伸而成的。","As to the interior of the island, its general aspect was this, very woody throughout the southern part from the mountain to the shore, and arid and sandy in the northern part.Between the volcano and the east coast Cyrus Harding and his companions were surprised to see a lake, bordered with green trees, the existence of which they had not suspected.Seen from this height, the lake appeared to be on the same level as the ocean, but, on reflection, the engineer explained to his companions that the altitude of this little sheet of water must be about three hundred feet, because the plateau, which was its basin, was but a prolongation of the coast."
"“这是淡水湖吗？”潘克洛夫问道。","“Is it a freshwater lake?” asked Pencroft."
"“当然，”工程师回答道，“因为湖水一定是高山上流下的水供给的。”","“Certainly,” replied the engineer, “for it must be fed by the water which flows from the mountain.”"
"“我看见了一条小河流入湖里。”赫伯特指着一道狭长的溪水说道，很显然溪水来自西边一带。","“I see a little river which runs into it,” said Herbert, pointing out a narrow stream, which evidently took its source somewhere in the west."
"“是啊，”哈丁说，“既然小河为湖泊供给了水源，那么在海边附近很可能有一个出口，多余的水会从那里排出去。我们可以在回去的时候看看。”","“Yes,” said Harding; “and since this stream feeds the lake, most probably on the side near the sea there is an outlet by which the surplus water escapes.We shall see that on our return.”"
"这条曲折的小河道和前面已经提过的河流，构成了岛上的水系，至少在探险家们看来是如此。然而，海岛有三分之二的土地都被树木覆盖，形成一片广阔的森林，所以很可能有其他河流从树丛底下流入海洋。甚至可以这样推断，从这片区域就能看出，海岛上瑰丽的温带植物品种着实丰富。没有迹象显示北部有流淌的河水，也许东北部的沼泽地带会有些死水。但是，除此以外就是一些沙丘、沙滩和干燥的土地，这和海岛上那些草木丰茂的地带形成鲜明的对比。","This little winding watercourse and the river already mentioned constituted the water-system, at least such as it was displayed to the eyes of the explorers.However, it was possible that under the masses of trees which covered two-thirds of the island, forming an immense forest, other rivers ran towards the sea.It might even be inferred that such was the case, so rich did this region appear in the most magnificent specimens of the flora of the temperate zones.There was no indication of running water in the north, though perhaps there might be stagnant water among the marshes in the northeast; but that was all, in addition to the downs, sand, and aridity which contrasted so strongly with the luxuriant vegetation of the rest of the island."
"火山不在海岛中央，相反，它矗立在西北地带，好似两个地带的分界线。在西南、正南和东北地带，第一部分的支脉完全被翠绿的树木笼盖。北部地带则恰恰相反，人们可以清楚地看见山脉的分支，一直延展到沙地的平原上才收尾。当初火山喷发时，就是在这一边冲开了一个大的通道，大量的熔岩蔓延到狭窄的出口处，形成了东北方向的港湾。","The volcano did not occupy the central part; it rose, on the contrary, in the northwestern region, and seemed to mark the boundary of the two zones.At the southwest, at the south, and the southeast, the first part of the spurs were hidden under masses of verdure.At the north, on the contrary, one could follow their ramifications, which died away on the sandy plains.It was on this side that, at the time when the mountain was in a state of eruption, the discharge had worn away a passage, and a large heap of lava had spread to the narrow jaw which formed the northeastern gulf."
"赛勒斯·哈丁和他的伙伴们在山顶呆了一个小时。在他们的视线下方，海岛一览无余，如同一幅彩色的平面图，绿色的是森林，黄色的是沙地，蓝色的是水域。他们纵览了海岛的全貌，除了绿荫覆盖的土地、凹陷的山谷和火山裂口的内壁。","Cyrus Harding and his companions remained an hour at the top of the mountain.The island was displayed under their eyes, like a plan in relief with different tints, green for the forests, yellow for the sand, blue for the water.They viewed it in its tout-ensemble, nothing remained concealed but the ground hidden by verdure, the hollows of the valleys, and the interior of the volcanic chasms."
"一个重要的问题仍然悬而未决，而问题的答案对这些落难者们的未来却有着极大的影响。","One important question remained to be solved, and the answer would have a great effect upon the future of the castaways."
"这个岛上是否有人居住？","Was the island inhabited?"
"这个问题是记者提出的，经过他们一番仔细检查之后，答案似乎是否定的。","It was the reporter who put this question, to which after the close examination they had just made, the answer seemed to be in the negative."
"到处都没有发现人类开拓过的迹象。海岸上没有一簇茅舍，没有一个小屋，也没有一处渔场。岛上也没有袅袅上升的轻烟，证明无人居住。当然，距探索者们最远的地方——向西南方向延伸的半岛，大概有将近30英里——即使对于潘克洛夫，也很难发现那里有没有住宅。岛上四分之三的土地都被森林覆盖，所以他们也没法掀开层层的草木，看看底下是否藏着稀疏的村舍。但是总体看来，他们落在了太平洋上一个狭小空间的土地上，这里似乎完全是个荒岛。","Nowhere could the work of a human hand be perceived.Not a group of huts, not a solitary cabin, not a fishery on the shore.No smoke curling in the air betrayed the presence of man.It is true, a distance of nearly thirty miles separated the observers from the extreme points, that is, of the tail which extended to the southwest, and it would have been difficult, even to Pencroft’s eyes, to discover a habitation there.Neither could the curtain of verdure, which covered three-quarters of the island, be raised to see if it did not shelter some straggling village.But in general the islanders live on the shores of the narrow spaces which emerge above the waters of the Pacific, and this shore appeared to be an absolute desert."
"要想确定岛上究竟有没有居民，只有进行更为全面的探索才能水落石出。但是附近岛屿上的居民会不会经常光顾这里呢？哪怕只是偶尔也好。这个问题很难回答。方圆50英里之内看不见一处陆地。无论是对于马来人的快速三角帆船，还是波利尼西亚人的大独木舟，横渡50英里的距离简直轻而易举。一切都取决于海岛的位置，它是孤立地立于太平洋上，还是靠近什么群岛？赛勒斯·哈丁能否不借助工具就计算出它们所处的经纬度呢？这很困难。既然他对此心存怀疑，最好还是谨慎为妙，未雨绸缪，防范土著居民突然出现。","Until a more complete exploration, it might be admitted that the island was uninhabited.But was it frequented, at least occasionally, by the natives of neighboring islands?It was difficult to reply to this question.No land appeared within a radius of fifty miles.But fifty miles could be easily crossed, either by Malay proas or by the large Polynesian canoes.Everything depended on the position of the island, of its isolation in the Pacific, or of its proximity to archipelagoes.Would Cyrus Harding be able to find out their latitude and longitude without instruments?It would be difficult.Since he was in doubt, it was best to take precautions against a possible descent of neighboring natives."
"海岛探索之旅结束了，形状确定了，地势清楚了，大小计算好了，河流和山的分布也查清了。记者大致画下了森林和平原的位置。他们现在只需再次下山，并从矿物、动物和植物这三个角度来考察这片土地的情况。","The exploration of the island was finished, its shape determined, its features made out, its extent calculated, the water and mountain systems ascertained.The disposition of the forests and plains had been marked in a general way on the reporter’s plan.They had now only to descend the mountain slopes again, and explore the soil, in the triple point of view, of its mineral, vegetable, and animal resources."
"但在示意伙伴们动身之前，赛勒斯·哈丁以一种平静而严肃的口吻说道：","But before giving his companions the signal for departure, Cyrus Harding said to them in a calm, grave voice,—"
"“朋友们，是上天将我们抛在这一小块土地上。我们将要生活在这里，或许要住很久。或许会有意外的帮助，如果恰巧有船只路过此处。我说‘恰巧’，是因为这是一个毫不知名的小岛，甚至连个可以泊船的港口也没有，恐怕它处于惯常航线之外，也就是说，对于那些经常往返于太平洋各群岛的船只来讲，这里太偏南了，但对于绕过和恩角到澳洲去的船只来讲，这里又太偏北了。我丝毫不打算对你们隐瞒我们的处境……”","Here, my friends, is the small corner of land upon which the hand of the Almighty has thrown us.We are going to live here; a long time, perhaps.Perhaps, too, unexpected help will arrive, if some ship passes by chance.I say by chance, because this is an unimportant island; there is not even a port in which ships could anchor, and it is to be feared that it is situated out of the route usually followed, that is to say, too much to the south for the ships which frequent the archipelagoes of the Pacific, and too much to the north for those which go to Australia by doubling Cape Horn.I wish to hide nothing of our position from you—”"
"“你是对的，亲爱的赛勒斯，”记者兴奋地说，“你身边的人都是男子汉。他们都信任你，你也可以信任他们。是不是这样，朋友们？”","“And you are right, my dear Cyrus,” replied the reporter, with animation.“You have to deal with men.They have confidence in you, and you can depend upon them.Is it not so, my friends?”"
"“我完全遵从你的指挥。”赫伯特握住工程师的手说道。","“I will obey you in everything, captain,” said Herbert, seizing the engineer’s hand."
"“你是我永远的主人，无论在哪里！”纳布喊道。","“My master always, and everywhere!” cried Neb."
"“至于我嘛，”水手说道，“如果我有任何抱怨，我就不叫杰克·潘克洛夫，只要你愿意，我们就在这座岛上开辟出一个小美国！我们要建立城池，我们要铺设铁路，开通电报。等到某天岛上发生了巨大的变化，一切都秩序井然，变得文明的时候，我们就去把它献给联合政府。我只有一个要求。”","“As for me,” said the sailor, “if I ever grumble at work, my name’s not Jack Pencroft, and if you like, captain, we will make a little America of this island!We will build towns, we will establish railways, start telegraphs, and one fine day, when it is quite changed, quite put in order and quite civilized, we will go and offer it to the government of the Union.Only, I ask one thing.”"
"“什么？”记者问。","“What is that?” said the reporter."
"“那就是，我们不要把自己看作是落难者，而是拓荒者，我们来这里是为了定居的。”哈丁禁不住笑了起来，水手的建议被采纳了。他感谢了他的朋友，并补充说，他会依靠大家的力量，并依托上天的保佑。","“It is, that we do not consider ourselves castaways, but colonists, who have come here to settle.”Harding could not help smiling, and the sailor’s idea was adopted.He then thanked his companions, and added, that he would rely on their energy and on the aid of Heaven."
"“好了，现在我们回‘石窟’吧！”潘克洛夫喊道。","“Well, now let us set off to the Chimneys!” cried Pencroft."
"“等一下，朋友们，”工程师说道，“我认为应该给这个海岛起个名字，还有我们看到的海角、地岬、河流，也要起个名字。”","“One minute, my friends,” said the engineer.“It seems to me it would be a good thing to give a name to this island, as well as to, the capes, promontories, and watercourses, which we can see.”"
"“太好了，”记者说道，“以后我们要发指令和遵循指令的时候，就简单多了。”","“Very good,” said the reporter.“In the future, that will simplify the instructions which we shall have to give and follow.”"
"“的确如此，”水手说道，“我们已经能够表达出自己去往何处，或从何处来了。起码听起来像个地方。”","“Indeed,” said the sailor, “already it is something to be able to say where one is going, and where one has come from.At least, it looks like somewhere.”"
"“比如说‘石窟’。”赫伯特说道。","“The Chimneys, for example,” said Herbert."
"“完全正确！”潘克洛夫回答，“这个名字最实用了，这可是我自己想出来的。我们就把第一次宿营的地方叫‘石窟’吧，赛勒斯先生？”","“Exactly!” replied Pencroft.“That name was the most convenient, and it came to me quite of myself.Shall we keep the name of the Chimneys for our first encampment, captain?”"
"“好的，潘克洛夫，既然你给了它名字，就这么叫吧。”","“Yes, Pencroft, since you have so christened it.”"
"“太棒了！至于其他的也很容易，”水手兴致勃勃地说，“赫伯特经常给我讲起鲁宾逊的故事，我们就模仿他，给这里起名吧，比如上苍湾、鲸鱼岬、失望角！”","“Good! as for the others, that will be easy,” returned the sailor, who was in high spirits.“Let us give them names, as the Robinsons did, whose story Herbert has often read to me; Providence Bay, Whale Point, Cape Disappointment!”"
"“不如就用哈丁先生的名字来命名吧，”赫伯特说，“还有史佩莱先生的名字，纳布的名字……”","“Or, rather, the names of Captain Harding,” said Herbert, “of Mr. Spilett, of Neb!—”"
"“还有我的名字！”纳布喊道，露出他雪白发亮的牙齿。","“My name!” cried Neb, showing his sparkling white teeth."
"“有何不可？”潘克洛夫说，“纳布港，很好啊！还有吉丁角——”","“Why not?” replied Pencroft.“Port Neb, that would do very well!And Cape Gideon—”"
"“我更愿意借用祖国的地名，”记者说，“这会让我们时刻不忘美国。”","“I should prefer borrowing names from our country,” said the reporter, “which would remind us of America.”"
"“好，对于重要的地方，”赛勒斯·哈丁接着说道，“我十分赞成这样命名海湾和海洋。比方说，我们可以把东边的大海湾叫做联合湾，南边的大海湾就叫华盛顿湾，我们所处的这座山就叫富兰克林山，我们眼下延伸的湖就叫格兰特湖，这样再好不过了，朋友们。这些名字会让我们想起自己的祖国，想起那些为祖国增光的伟大公民。至于我们从山顶看到的这些河流、海湾、海角和地岬，选的名字要能体现它们的独特形状。这样印象更深刻，也更实际。海岛的形状太奇特了，我们不必劳神想象它与什么东西相似。至于那些我们尚不知道的溪流，它们分布于森林各处，我们将来要去进一步探索，这些以后发现的溪流，我们在发现之时再命名。这样如何，朋友们？”","“Yes, for the principal ones,” then said Cyrus Harding; “for those of the bays and seas, I admit it willingly.We might give to that vast bay on the east the name of Union Bay, for example; to that large hollow on the south, Washington Bay; to the mountain upon which we are standing, that of Mount Franklin; to that lake which is extended under our eyes, that of Lake Grant; nothing could be better, my friends.These names will recall our country, and those of the great citizens who have honored it; but for the rivers, gulfs, capes, and promontories, which we perceive from the top of this mountain, rather let us choose names which will recall their particular shape.They will impress themselves better on our memory, and at the same time will be more practical.The shape of the island is so strange that we shall not be troubled to imagine what it resembles.As to the streams which we do not know as yet, in different parts of the forest which we shall explore later, the creeks which afterwards will he discovered, we can christen them as we find them.What do you think, my friends?”"
"工程师的提议赢得了伙伴们的一致赞成。海岛在他们的眼下铺展，如同一幅地图，他们只差给各角各点起个名字了。吉丁·史佩莱记下这些名字后，海岛的地理名字也就正式被采纳了。正如工程师建议的那样，他们首先将两个海湾和高山命名为联合湾、华盛顿湾和富兰克林山。","The engineer’s proposal was unanimously agreed to by his companions.The island was spread out under their eyes like a map, and they had only to give names to all its angles and points.Gideon Spilett would write them down, and the geographical nomenclature of the island would be definitely adopted.First, they named the two bays and the mountain, Union Bay, Washington Bay, and Mount Franklin, as the engineer had suggested."
"“现在，”记者说道，“我建议将海岛西南的半岛叫做盘蛇半岛，半岛末端的弯尾巴就叫爬虫角，因为它很像一个爬虫的尾巴。”","“Now,” said the reporter, “to this peninsula at the southwest of the island, I propose to give the name of Serpentine Peninsula, and that of Reptile-end to the bent tail which terminates it, for it is just like a reptile’s tail.”"
"“同意。”工程师说道。","“Adopted,” said the engineer."
"“那么，”赫伯特指着海岛的另一端说，“我们就把那个海湾叫做鲨鱼湾吧，它很像张开的大鱼嘴。”","“Now,” said Herbert, pointing to the other extremity of the island, “let us call this gulf which is so singularly like a pair of open jaws, Shark Gulf.”"
"“妙极了！”潘克洛夫喊道，“我们就把嘴的两部分叫做颚骨角吧，这样就完全匹配了。”","“Capital!” cried Pencroft, “and we can complete the resemblance by naming the two parts of the jaws Mandible Cape.”"
"“但是还有两个海角呢。”记者发现。","“But there are two capes,” observed the reporter."
"“好吧，”潘克洛夫答道，“我们可以分别叫它们北颚角和南颚角。”","“Well,” replied Pencroft, “we can have North Mandible Cape and South Mandible Cape.”"
"“都记好了。”史佩莱说道。","“They are inscribed,” said Spilett."
"“只有海岛西南角没命名了。”潘克洛夫说。","“There is only the point at the southeastern extremity of the island to be named,” said Pencroft."
"“是联合湾的末端那个吗？”赫伯特问道。","“That is, the extremity of Union Bay?” asked Herbert."
"“就叫爪角吧。”纳布脱口喊道，他也想成为某部分领域的教父。","“Claw Cape,” cried Neb directly, who also wished to be godfather to some part of his domain."
"事实上，纳布确实起了个十分贴切的名字，因为海岛的奇异形状像是一只怪兽，这个海角十分像是这只怪兽的强大利爪。","In truth, Neb had found an excellent name, for this cape was very like the powerful claw of the fantastic animal which this singularly-shaped island represented."
"潘克洛夫对于事情的进展非常满意，他们很快就给河流起了个名字，因为气球将他们降落在河水附近，他们才可以喝到淡水，所以为了感谢上苍的眷顾，他们给这条河命名为慈悲河。落难者们首次登陆的小岛叫做安全岛，高耸在“石窟”上方的花岗岩峭壁顶端是一块高地，站在那里放眼望去，整个宽阔的海湾尽收眼底，于是他们就把这个高地叫做眺望岗。","Pencroft was delighted at the turn things had taken, and their imaginations soon gave to the river which furnished the settlers with drinking water and near which the balloon had thrown them, the name of the Mercy, in true gratitude to Providence.To the islet upon which the castaways had first landed, the name of Safety Island; to the plateau which crowned the high granite precipice above the Chimneys, and from whence the gaze could embrace the whole of the vast bay, the name of Prospect Heights."
"最后，他们又把覆盖盘蛇半岛、不能穿越的整片森林命名为远西森林。","Lastly, all the masses of impenetrable wood which covered the Serpentine Peninsula were named the forests of the Far West."
"海岛上看得见和已知的地方的命名告一段落，以后发现新地点时会继续命名。","The nomenclature of the visible and known parts of the island was thus finished, and later, they would complete it as they made fresh discoveries."
"至于各个部分的方位，工程师根据太阳的高度和位置粗略地做了测定，将联合岛和眺望岗定位在正东方向。但是第二天，通过日出和日落的准确时间和记录太阳在正午的位置，他准确定位了海岛的正北方向，因为海岛位于南半球，正午时分太阳处于南方，而不是北方，这跟在北半球所看到的太阳有所不同。","As to the points of the compass, the engineer had roughly fixed them by the height and position of the sun, which placed Union Bay and Prospect Heights to the east.But the next day, by taking the exact hour of the rising and setting of the sun, and by marking its position between this rising and setting, he reckoned to fix the north of the island exactly, for, in consequence of its situation in the Southern Hemisphere, the sun, at the precise moment of its culmination, passed in the north and not in the south, as, in its apparent movement, it seems to do, to those places situated in the Northern Hemisphere."
"一切工作已经完毕，居民们只等着走下富兰克林山回到“石窟”了，这时，潘克洛夫突然喊叫起来：","Everything was finished, and the settlers had only to descend Mount Franklin to return to the Chimneys, when Pencroft cried out,—"
"“天啊！我们太傻了！”","“Well! we are preciously stupid!”"
"“怎么了？”吉丁·史佩莱合上笔记本正准备离开。","“Why?” asked Gideon Spilett, who had closed his notebook and risen to depart."
"“怎么了！我们的岛！我们竟然忘记给它起名字了！”","“Why! our island! we have forgotten to christen it!”"
"赫伯特正准备提议用工程师的名字来命名，伙伴们会鼓掌赞成的，但这时赛勒斯·哈丁简单地说道：","Herbert was going to propose to give it the engineer’s name and all his companions would have applauded him, when Cyrus Harding said simply,—"
"“我们就用一个伟大公民的名字命名它吧，朋友们，这个公民正为捍卫美利坚合众国的统一而作斗争！我们就叫它林肯岛吧！”","“Let us give it the name of a great citizen, my friend; of him who now struggles to defend the unity of the American Republic!Let us call it Lincoln Island!”"
"工程师的提议得到了大家的三次叫好声。","The engineer’s proposal was replied to by three hurrahs."
"那晚睡觉前，新的开拓者们聊起了他们阔别的祖国，谈到了恐怖的血腥战争，他们确信南方军很快就会被打败，而北方的事业是正义的事业，加上格兰特将军和林肯的领导，一定会取得胜利。","And that evening, before sleeping, the new colonists talked of their absent country; they spoke of the terrible war which stained it with blood; they could not doubt that the South would soon be subdued, and that the cause of the North, the cause of justice, would triumph, thanks to Grant, thanks to Lincoln!"
"这是发生在1865年3月30日的事情。他们从未想到16天以后，华盛顿会发生一件恐怖的罪行，在耶稣受难日那天，亚伯拉罕·林肯竟死在一个丧心病狂的暴徒手下。","Now this happened the 30th of March, 1865.They little knew that sixteen days afterwards a frightful crime would be committed in Washington, and that on Good Friday Abraham Lincoln would fall by the hand of a fanatic."
"第十二章","Chapter 12"
"他们现在开始下山。顺着火山口向下走，绕过火山锥，他们回到了前一晚的宿营地。潘克洛夫觉得应该是早饭时间了，于是就看了看记者和工程师的表，确定一下时间。","They now began the descent of the mountain.Climbing down the crater, they went round the cone and reached their encampment of the previous night.Pencroft thought it must be breakfast-time, and the watches of the reporter and engineer were therefore consulted to find out the hour."
"吉丁·史佩莱的表没有浸过海水，因为他是被抛向了海浪不能到达的沙滩上。这块表质量上乘，是一只完好无缺的怀表，记者每天都不忘小心翼翼地上发条。","That of Gideon Spilett had been preserved from the sea-water, as he had been thrown at once on the sand out of reach of the waves.It was an instrument of excellent quality, a perfect pocket chronometer, which the reporter had not forgotten to wind up carefully every day."
"至于工程师的表，当然是他在沙丘上的那段时间内停的。","As to the engineer’s watch, it, of course, had stopped during the time which he had passed on the downs."
"工程师现在给他的表上了发条，根据太阳的高度估计应是上午九点，他就把表调到了那个时间。","The engineer now wound it up, and ascertaining by the height of the sun that it must be about nine o’clock in the morning, he put his watch at that hour."
"“不，亲爱的史佩莱，等一下。你的表显示的是里士满的时间，是吧？”","“No, my dear Spilett, wait.You have kept the Richmond time, have you not?”"
"“是啊，赛勒斯。”","“Yes, Cyrus.”"
"“那么，你表上的时间是根据里士满的子午线确定的，里士满和华盛顿几乎处于同一子午线，是吗？”","“Consequently, your watch is set by the meridian of that town, which is almost that of Washington?”"
"“的确如此。”","“Undoubtedly.”"
"“很好。不要动它。记住每天给它上发条，调准确，但不要拨动表的指针。这也许对我们有用处。”","“Very well, keep it thus.Content yourself with winding it up very, exactly, but do not touch the hands.This may be of use to us.”"
"“这样做有什么用处呢？”水手暗自琢磨。","“What will be the good of that?” thought the sailor."
"他们痛快地吃了一顿，余下的猎物和松子都吃光了。但是潘克洛夫一点也不担心，他们在路上可以找到吃的。托普吃的那份很符合它的口味，它知道怎样在灌木丛里寻找新的猎物。此外，水手想起可以让工程师制造一些火药或一两只猎枪，他认为这对工程师来讲简直是小菜一碟。","They ate, and so heartily, that the store of game and almonds was totally exhausted.But Pencroft was not at all uneasy, they would supply themselves on the way.Top, whose share had been very much to his taste, would know how to find some fresh game among the brushwood.Moreover, the sailor thought of simply asking the engineer to manufacture some powder and one or two fowling-pieces; he supposed there would be no difficulty in that."
"离开高地之后，工程师向伙伴们提议另选一条道路回到“石窟”。他想观察一下格兰特湖，它被丛林环抱，十分壮观。于是，他们沿着一个支脉的山顶行进，也许能在这些支脉之间发现供给湖水的河流源头。在聊天时，居民们已开始引用他们自己起的新地名了，这给他们交流想法带来了极大便利。赫伯特和潘克洛夫——一个年轻，一个孩子气——都着了迷，水手边走边说道；","On leaving the plateau, the captain proposed to his companions to return to the Chimneys by a new way.He wished to reconnoiter Lake Grant, so magnificently framed in trees.They therefore followed the crest of one of the spurs, between which the creek that supplied the lake probably had its source.In talking, the settlers already employed the names which they had just chosen, which singularly facilitated the exchange of their ideas.Herbert and Pencroft—the one young and the other very boyish—were enchanted, and while walking, the sailor said,"
"“嘿，赫伯特！听起来多棒啊！这样我们就不会走丢了，孩子，因为不管我们是朝着格兰特湖的方向走，还是沿着慈悲河穿越远西森林，我们一定能到眺望岗，然后就会到达联合湾！”","“Hey, Herbert! how capital it sounds!It will be impossible to lose ourselves, my boy, since, whether we follow the way to Lake Grant, or whether we join the Mercy through the woods of the Far West, we shall be certain to arrive at Prospect Heights, and, consequently, at Union Bay!”"
"大家达成一致，一定要等到人员聚齐了再走，谁都不可以单独行动。海岛的茂密森林中一定有危险的野兽出没，谨慎起见，还是要小心提防为好。通常，都是有潘克洛夫、赫伯特和纳布先行，托普带路，他总是钻进灌木丛里，用鼻子嗅嗅。记者和工程师并排前行，吉丁·史佩莱随时准备记录下每一个事件，工程师大部分时间都很沉默，有时会走到一旁，捡起些东西——一块矿物，或是某些植物，他总是将捡回来的东西装进口袋里，不发一言。","It had been agreed, that without forming a compact band, the settlers should not stray away from each other.It was very certain that the thick forests of the island were inhabited by dangerous animals, and it was prudent to be on their guard.In general, Pencroft, Herbert, and Neb walked first, preceded by Top, who poked his nose into every bush.The reporter and the engineer went together, Gideon Spilett ready to note every incident, the engineer silent for the most part, and only stepping aside to pick up one thing or another, a mineral or vegetable substance, which he put into his pocket, without making any remark."
"“他都捡了些什么东西啊？”潘克洛夫小声说，“我想找些值得弯腰去捡的东西，可是一无所获。”","“What can he be picking up?” muttered Pencroft.“I have looked in vain for anything that’s worth the trouble of stooping for.”"
"快到十点的时候，小队跨下了富兰克林山的最后一级山坡。到目前为止，这里的灌木丛和树木分布稀疏。他们走过一片淡黄色的石灰质地面，这种土壤形成一个平原，几乎长达一英里，一直延伸到森林的边缘。大块的玄武岩分散在平原上，在某些地方分布得非常混杂，根据毕斯可夫的学说，这种玄武岩需要经过三亿五千万年才能冷却成型。然而，这里却没有熔岩的痕迹，熔岩在北部的山坡上极其常见。","Towards ten o’clock the little band descended the last declivities of Mount Franklin.As yet the ground was scantily strewn with bushes and trees.They were walking over yellowish calcinated earth, forming a plain of nearly a mile long, which extended to the edge of the wood.Great blocks of that basalt, which, according to Bischof, takes three hundred and fifty millions of years to cool, strewed the plain, very confused in some places.However, there were here no traces of lava, which was spread more particularly over the northern slopes."
"赛勒斯·哈丁希望不出意外地到达小河的河道，他认为河道应在平原边缘的森林脚下，这时他却看见赫伯特匆忙地跑回来，纳布和水手则躲在岩石后面。","Cyrus Harding expected to reach, without incident, the course of the creek, which he supposed flowed under the trees at the border of the plain, when he saw Herbert running hastily back, while Neb and the sailor were hiding behind the rocks."
"“怎么了，孩子？”史佩莱问道。","“What’s the matter, my boy?” asked Spilett."
"“烟，”赫伯特回答道，“我们看见石头堆里冒着烟，就在离我们一百步远的地方。”","“Smoke,” replied Herbert.“We have seen smoke among the rocks, a hundred paces from us.”"
"“难道这里有人？”记者喊道。","“Men in this place?” cried the reporter."
"“在不知道要应对谁之前，我们绝不能暴露自己，”赛勒斯·哈丁说道，“我认为这里没有原住民，我最担心的就是遇到他们。托普在哪里？”","“We must avoid showing ourselves before knowing with whom we have to deal,” replied Cyrus Harding.“I trust that there are no natives on this island; I dread them more than anything else.Where is Top?”"
"“托普在前面。”","“Top is on before.”"
"“它没有叫吗？”","“And he doesn’t bark?”"
"“没有。”","“No.”"
"“这就奇怪了。无论如何，我们都要把它叫回来。”","“That is strange.However, we must try to call him back.”"
"没多久，工程师、吉丁·史佩莱和赫伯特与他们的另外两个伙伴会合了，他们也藏在了玄武岩石堆的后面。","In a few moments, the engineer, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert had rejoined their two companions, and like them, they kept out of sight behind the heaps of basalt."
"从那里，他们清楚地看见一缕淡黄色的烟升向天空。","From thence they clearly saw smoke of a yellowish color rising in the air."
"托普的主人轻轻吹了声口哨把它喊回来，他向伙伴们打了个手势，叫他们等着，接着就从岩石中溜了出去。开拓者们一动不动，焦急地等待着探索的结果，这时工程师的一声叫喊使大家都急忙冲向前。他们很快就来到工程师面前，立刻感觉到空气中弥漫着一股刺鼻的怪味。","Top was recalled by a slight whistle from his master, and the latter, signing to his companions to wait for him, glided away among the rocks.The colonists, motionless, anxiously awaited the result of this exploration, when a shout from the engineer made them hasten forward.They soon joined him, and were at once struck with a disagreeable odor which impregnated the atmosphere."
"这怪味很容易辨别，工程师一闻就已经猜到刚才那股烟源自哪里了，工程师起初看见烟时很吃惊，这并不是没有理由的。","The odor, easily recognized, was enough for the engineer to guess what the smoke was which at first, not without cause, had startled him."
"“这火，”他说，“或者说这烟是自然生成的。那里有一个硫磺泉，泉水有治疗咽喉痛的功效。”","“This fue,” said he, “or rather, this smoke is produced by nature alone.There is a sulphur spring there, which will cure all our sore throats.”"
"“上尉！”潘克洛夫喊道，“我没有感冒是多么可惜啊！”","“Captain!” cried Pencroft.“What a pity that I haven’t got a cold!”"
"于是居民们向着冒烟的地方走去。他们在那里看到了一个硫磺泉，大量的泉水在岩石之间涌出，散发出一股强烈的硫酸味，这是因为吸收了空气中氧气的缘故。","The settlers then directed their steps towards the place from which the smoke escaped.They there saw a sulphur spring which flowed abundantly between the rocks, and its waters discharged a strong sulphuric acid odor, after having absorbed the oxygen of the air."
"赛勒斯·哈丁用手蘸了泉水，感觉很油腻。他尝了尝，发现味道十分甘甜。至于水的温度，他估计有华氏95度。赫伯特问他是根据什么算出来的。","Cyrus Harding, dipping in his hand, felt the water oily to the touch.He tasted it and found it rather sweet.As to its temperature, that he estimated at ninety-five degrees Fahrenheit.Herbert having asked on what he based this calculation,—"
"“很简单，孩子，”他回答道，“因为当我把手伸进水里时，既不感到烫，也不觉得冰。因此，它的温度和人的体温相当，也就是95度左右。”","“Its quite simple, my boy,” said he, “for, in plunging my hand into the water, I felt no sensation either of heat or cold.Therefore it has the same temperature as the human body, which is about ninety-five degrees.”"
"硫磺泉对于居民们没有什么实用价值，于是他们继续前行，朝着几百步以外的密林边缘走去。","The sulphur spring not being of any actual use to the settlers, they proceeded towards the thick border of the forest, which began some hundred paces off."
"正如他们所推断的，清澈明亮的河水正是从这里流出，两边的河岸很高，都是红土，这种颜色表明土里含有氧化铁。根据土壤的颜色，这条小河马上被命名为红河。","There, as they had conjectured, the waters of the stream flowed clear and limpid between high banks of red earth, the color of which betrayed the presence of oxide of iron.From this color, the name of Red Creek was immediately given to the watercourse."
"这是一条大河，水深且清，由山涧汇合而成，一半是河水，一半是湍流，时而平缓地流过沙石，发出潺潺的响声，时而冲击岩石，或是从高处直泻下来形成瀑布，流向湖泊。河水长达一英里半以上，宽达30到40英尺。河水甘甜，想来湖水也是如此。这里是福地，如果能在湖边找到一个比“石窟”更舒适的居所就好了。","It was only a large stream, deep and clear, formed of the mountain water, which, half river, half torrent, here rippling peacefully over the sand, there falling against the rocks or dashing down in a cascade, ran towards the lake, over a distance of a mile and a half, its breadth varying from thirty to forty feet.Its waters were sweet, and it was supposed that those of the lake were so also.A fortunate circumstance, in the event of their finding on its borders a more suitable dwelling than the Chimneys."
"河水流出几百英尺以外，两岸树阴如盖，这些树木大多是美国和塔斯马尼亚温带地区的常见品种，而非他们在离眺望岗几英里一带探索时所看见的松柏科树木。此时正值四月伊始，相当于北半球的十月，也就是初秋，树木的枝叶仍然很丰茂。林中主要是些木麻黄和桉树，其中有的树种明年就会产出一种香甜的甘露蜜，和东方的甘露蜜类似。倾斜的河岸上澳洲杉丛生，河岸上还覆盖着一种很高的草，在新荷兰被称为“袜草”。然而，太平洋各群岛盛产的椰子在这个岛上却不见踪迹，毫无疑问，是因为纬度太低了。","As to the trees, which some hundred feet downwards shaded the banks of the creek, they belonged, for the most part, to the species which abound in the temperate zone of America and Tasmania, and no longer to those coniferae observed in that portion of the island already explored to some miles from Prospect Heights.At this time of the year, the commencement of the month of April, which represents the month of October, in this hemisphere, that is, the beginning of autumn, they were still in full leaf.They consisted principally of casuarinas and eucalypti, some of which next year would yield a sweet manna, similar to the manna of the East.Clumps of Australian cedars rose on the sloping banks, which were also covered with the high grass called “tussac” in New Holland; but the cocoanut, so abundant in the archipelagoes of the Pacific, seemed to be wanting in the island, the latitude, doubtless, being too low."
"“多可惜啊！”赫伯特说，“那么有用的树，又有那么好的果实！”","“What a pity!” said Herbert, “such a useful tree, and which has such beautiful nuts!”"
"鸟聚集在桉树和木麻黄稀疏的枝杈间，枝杈并没有遮住它们的翅膀。黑的、白的和灰色的凤头鹦鹉，五颜六色的长尾小鹦鹉，浑身闪耀绿色光泽的红头翠鸟，蓝色的吸蜜小鹦鹉，还有其他各种各样的飞禽遍布周围，如同透过一个棱镜，鸟儿们扑扇着翅膀唧唧喳喳地叫着，发出震耳欲聋的喧嚣声。突然，一阵不和谐的奇怪合奏突然响起，在密林中回荡。居民们先后听到了鸟叫声、四足兽的吼叫声，还有一种他们认为是从土著人嘴里发出的声音。纳布和赫伯特冲入灌木丛，甚至连谨慎为上的基本原则也抛之脑后了。幸好，他们在那里既没发现什么可怕的野兽，也没发现什么危险的土著，只看见六只擅长模仿各类叫声的飞禽，也就是山雉。他们用一根棍子精准地挥打了几下，立刻中断了鸟儿们的合奏，也正好可以用它们准备一顿丰盛的晚餐。","As to the birds, they swarmed among the scanty branches of the eucalypti and casuarinas, which did not hinder the display of their wings.Black, white, or gray cockatoos, paroquets, with plumage of all colors, kingfishers of a sparkling green and crowned with red, blue lories, and various other birds appeared on all sides, as through a prism, fluttering about and producing a deafening clamor.Suddenly, a strange concert of discordant voices resounded in the midst of a thicket.The settlers heard successively the song of birds, the cry of quadrupeds, and a sort of clacking which they might have believed to have escaped from the lips of a native.Neb and Herbert rushed towards the bush, forgetting even the most elementary principles of prudence.Happily, they found there, neither a formidable wild beast nor a dangerous native, but merely half a dozen mocking and singing birds, known as mountain pheasants.A few skillful blows from a stick soon put an end to their concert, and procured excellent food for the evening’s dinner."
"赫伯特还发现了一些美丽的鸽子，翅膀是青铜色的，有的冠毛绚丽多姿，有的颜色通身碧绿，和麦夸里港的鸽子十分相像。可是想要抓住它们，或者那些成群飞行的乌鸦和喜鹊却是不可能的。","Herbert also discovered some magnificent pigeons with bronzed wings, some superbly crested, others draped in green, like their congeners at Port-Macquarie; but it was impossible to reach them, or the crows and magpies which flew away in flocks."
"本来只要短程射一枪就可以打死一大群鸟，但是猎人们的武器只限于棍棒和石头，这些原始武器实在是无法满足需要。","A charge of small shot would have made great slaughter among these birds, but the hunters were still limited to sticks and stones, and these primitive weapons proved very insufficient."
"一群四足动物在丛林中连跑带跳地穿梭，一跃就是30英尺，是真真正正的“飞兽”，它们在密林中飞奔，跳得又快又高，以至于人们会认为它们从一棵树跳到另一棵树，像松鼠一样，这时武器的不足愈发凸显出来。","Their insufficiency was still more clearly shown when a troop of quadrupeds, jumping, bounding, making leaps of thirty feet, regular flying mammiferae, fled over the thickets, so quickly and at such a height, that one would have thought that they passed from one tree to another like squirrels."
"“袋鼠！”赫伯特喊道。","“Kangaroos!” cried Herbert."
"“它们好不好吃？”潘克洛夫问道。","“Are they good to eat?” asked Pencroft."
"“炖着吃，”记者说，“它们的肉比得上最好的野味！”","“Stewed,” replied the reporter, “their flesh is equal to the best venison!—”"
"吉丁·史佩莱还没说完这句激动人心的话，水手就循着袋鼠的足迹冲出去了，纳布和赫伯特跟在后面。赛勒斯·哈丁在后面想喊回他们，但无济于事。但猎人想要追上这些敏捷的猎物也是白费力气，它们弹跳起来像是皮球一样。追了五分钟后，他们已经上气不接下气，同时袋鼠也不见了，消失在丛林里。托普也不比它的主人好到哪里去。","Gideon Spilett had not finished this exciting sentence when the sailor, followed by Neb and Herbert, darted on the kangaroos tracks.Cyrus Harding called them back in vain.But it was in vain too for the hunters to pursue such agile game, which went bounding away like balls.After a chase of five minutes, they lost their breath, and at the same time all sight of the creatures, which disappeared in the wood.Top was not more successful than his masters."
"“上尉，”工程师和记者赶上来之后，潘克洛夫说，“上尉，你看得很清楚了，我们不造几支枪就过不下去了。能不能造出来啊？”","“Captain,” said Pencroft, when the engineer and the reporter had rejoined them, “Captain, you see quite well we can’t get on unless we make a few guns.Will that be possible?”"
"“也许吧，”工程师答道，“可是，我们首先要造些弓箭，我相信你会像澳洲的猎人一样熟练地使用它们。”","“Perhaps,” replied the engineer, “but we will begin by first manufacturing some bows and arrows, and I don’t doubt that you will become as clever in the use of them as the Australian hunters.”"
"“弓箭！”潘克洛夫不屑地说道，“那可都是小孩子们用的玩意！”","“Bows and arrows!” said Pencroft scornfully.“That’s all very well for children!”"
"“别太自负了，我的朋友潘克洛夫，”记者说，“弓箭可是多少世纪以来使大地染上鲜血的工具。火药不过是近来才有的，可是不幸得很，战争自有人类以来就存在了。”","“Don’t be proud, friend Pencroft,” replied the reporter.“Bows and arrows were sufficient for centuries to stain the earth with blood.Powder is but a thing of yesterday, and war is as old as the human race—unhappily.”"
"“千真万确，那是事实，史佩莱先生，”水手说，“我讲话总是不假思索。你多包涵！”","“Faith, that’s true, Mr. Spilett,” replied the sailor, “and I always speak too quickly.You must excuse me!”"
"这时候，赫伯特继续谈论他一向喜欢的博物学，话题又转到了袋鼠身上，他说：","Meanwhile, Herbert constant to his favorite science, Natural History, reverted to the kangaroos, saying,—"
"“此外，我们现在要对付的是最难捕捉的一种动物。它们长着灰色的长毛，如果我没记错的话，应该还有黑色和红色的袋鼠，岩石袋鼠和鼷鼠，这些都要好捉些。据估计大概有12种。”","“Besides, we had to deal just now with the species which is most difficult to catch.They were giants with long gray fur; but if I am not mistaken, there exist black and red kangaroos, rock kangaroos, and rat kangaroos, which are more easy to get hold of.It is reckoned that there are about a dozen species.”"
"“赫伯特，”水手以说教式的口吻说道，“在我看来，袋鼠只有一种，那就是‘肉叉上的袋鼠’，而我们今晚偏偏没有捉到这种袋鼠。”","“Herbert,” replied the sailor sententiously, “there is only one species of kangaroos to me, that is ‘kangaroo on the spit,’ and it’s just the one we haven’t got this evening!”"
"大家听了潘克洛夫大师的新分类法后，不禁大笑起来。对于落到只能吃会唱歌的山雉的地步，诚实的水手无法掩饰心中的遗憾，但是幸运又一次眷顾了水手。","They could not help laughing at Master Pencroft’s new classification.The honest sailor did not hide his regret at being reduced for dinner to the singing pheasants, but fortune once more showed itself obliging to him."
"事实上，托普为了自身的利益着想，到处去搜寻，强烈的食欲加倍刺激了它的灵敏直觉。如果托普私自去打猎，那么很有可能猎物只会落在它的爪牙之下，绝不会留给猎人们一点。可是由于纳布看着它，它只好本本分分。","In fact, Top, who felt that his interest was concerned went and ferreted everywhere with an instinct doubled by a ferocious appetite.It was even probable that if some piece of game did fall into his clutches, none would be left for the hunters, if Top was hunting on his own account; but Neb watched him and he did well."
"将近三点时，狗消失在灌木丛中，不时的咕哝声表明它在和什么动物对峙。纳布跟着它冲了进去，不久就看见托普迫切地吞食着一个四足动物，如果晚到十秒钟，就要被它整个吞进肚子里了。好在托普攻击的是一窝，除了它正在吞咽的那只，还有另外两只，瘫倒在草地上，我们说的这几只动物都是属于噬齿类动物。","Towards three o’clock the dog disappeared in the brushwood and gruntings showed that he was engaged in a struggle with some animal.Neb rushed after him, and soon saw Top eagerly devouring a quadruped, which ten seconds later would have been past recognizing in Top’s stomach.But fortunately the dog had fallen upon a brood, and besides the victim he was devouring, two other rodents—the animals in question belonged to that order—lay strangled on the turf."
"纳布又出现了，一手拎着一只啮齿动物，凯旋而归。它们的体积要比兔子稍大，毛是黄色的，中间夹杂些绿色的斑点，它们的尾巴发育得不完全。","Neb reappeared triumphantly holding one of the rodents in each hand.Their size exceeded that of a rabbit, their hair was yellow, mingled with green spots, and they had the merest rudiments of tails."
"这些美国公民并未被这种噬齿动物的正确名称难住。它们是长耳豚鼠，是刺鼠的一种，要比热带地区的同种和普通的美国兔子稍大些，长着一对长耳朵，下巴两边各长了五个臼齿，这点能让人们辨认出它们。","The citizens of the Union were at no loss for the right name of these rodents.They were maras, a sort of agouti, a little larger than their congeners of tropical countries, regular American rabbits, with long ears, jaws armed on each side with five molars, which distinguish the agouti."
"“哈哈！”潘克洛夫喊道，“烤肉来啦！现在我们可以回家了。”","“Hurrah!” cried Pencroft, “the roast has arrived! and now we can go home.”"
"他们停了一小会儿，又继续赶路。木麻黄、山龙眼和高大的橡胶树形成一个拱形门，清澈的红河水从下面流过。美丽的丁香树高耸，高达20英尺。还有许多年轻的自然学家不知道的树木种类，它们低垂在小河上，可以听到河水在葱郁的绿荫下潺潺流动。","The walk, interrupted for an instant, was resumed.The limpid waters of the Red Creek flowed under an arch of casuannas, banksias, and gigantic gum-trees.Superb lilacs rose to a height of twenty feet.Other arborescent species, unknown to the young naturalist, bent over the stream, which could be heard murmuring beneath the bowers of verdure."
"同时，河水在这里变宽了许多，赛勒斯·哈丁估计他们很快就能到达河口了。果不其然，当他们从一丛美丽的密林下钻出来的时候，河口赫然呈现在他们眼前。","Meanwhile the stream grew much wider, and Cyrus Harding supposed that they would soon reach its mouth.In fact, on emerging from beneath a thick clump of beautiful trees, it suddenly appeared before their eyes."
"探险者们来到了格兰特湖的西岸。这里的景色很值得驻足观赏。湖延伸到周围七英里的地方，面积约有250英亩，湖岸边静静生长着各类树木。向东边望去，一帘翠绿的屏障美丽如画，分布在几处较高的湖岸，透过屏障可以看见一片海洋闪烁着光芒。湖岸北面线条曲折，与其低处的陡峭轮廓对比鲜明。许多水禽经常栖息在这个小小的安大略湖畔，离南岸几百英尺的湖面有许多岩石浮出水面，它们很像美国安大略湖里的“千岛”。几对翠鸟相处和睦，栖息在一块石头上，神情严肃，一动不动地等着鱼儿，如发现目标，就尖叫一声冲进水里，然后用喙衔着猎物重新浮出水面。岸上和小岛上，有许多水禽大摇大摆地漫步，其中有野鸭、 鹈鹕、水鸡、红嘴鸟，以及舌头像刷子的水鸟和一两只琴鸟科的美丽水鸟，它们的尾巴张开时就像竖琴一样优雅。","The explorers had arrived on the western shore of Lake Grant.The place was well worth looking at.This extent of water, of a circumference of nearly seven miles and an area of two hundred and fifty acres, reposed in a border of diversified trees.Towards the east, through a curtain of verdure, picturesquely raised in some places, sparkled an horizon of sea.The lake was curved at the north, which contrasted with the sharp outline of its lower part.Numerous aquatic birds frequented the shores of this little Ontario, in which the thousand isles of its American namesake were represented by a rock which emerged from its surface, some hundred feet from the southern shore.There lived in harmony several couples of kingfishers perched on a stone, grave, motionless, watching for fish, then darting down, they plunged in with a sharp cry, and reappeared with their prey in their beaks.On the shores and on the islets, strutted wild ducks, pelicans, water-hens, red-beaks, philedons, furnished with a tongue like a brush, and one or two specimens of the splendid menura, the tail of which expands gracefully like a lyre."
"湖水甘甜清澈，颜色很深，水面上常有几处泛着水泡，同心的涟漪在湖面交相碰撞，由此可见，湖里游鱼肯定很多。","As to the water of the lake, it was sweet, limpid, rather dark, and from certain bubblings, and the concentric circles which crossed each other on the surface, it could not be doubted that it abounded in fish."
"“这个湖真美！”吉丁·史佩莱赞叹道，“我们最好住在湖畔！”","“This lake is really beautiful!” said Gideon Spilett.“We could live on its borders!”"
"“我们会住在这里的！”哈丁答道。","“We will live there!” replied Harding."
"居民们打算从最近的路回“石窟”去，于是就沿着湖岸南边会合处形成的拐角向下走去。但是从未有人用手扒开这里的灌木和密林，所以要想从这里开辟出一条道路来绝非易事。于是，为了到达眺望岗的北边，他们向海岸走去。他们在这个方向清出了两英里的道路，然后穿过最后一片树林幕帐，眼前出现了高地。高地上覆盖着一层厚厚的草地，前方就是那一望无垠的海洋。","The settlers, wishing to return to the Chimneys by the shortest way, descended towards the angle formed on the south by the junction of the lake’s bank.It was not without difficulty that they broke a path through the thickets and brushwood which had never been put aside by the hand of men, and they thus went towards the shore, so as to arrive at the north of Prospect Heights.Two miles were cleared in this direction, and then, after they had passed the last curtain of trees, appeared the plateau, carpeted with thick turf, and beyond that the infinite sea."
"要想回到“石窟”，只需斜穿过高地走一英里，然后向下走，直到慈悲河第一个绕行道形成的急弯处。但是，工程师迫切地想要了解溢出的湖水从何处泄出，又是怎样泄出的，于是他们就穿过树林，继续向北探索，前行了一英里半。附近极有可能存在瀑布，而且肯定是从花岗石缝中倾泻而下的。简而言之，这个湖是一个极大的中心盆地，由小河的流水渐渐灌注而成，湖水必然是通过瀑布流入大海的。如果真是如此，工程师认为，也许可以利用瀑布，借用它的力量，要不它也是白白被浪费掉。于是，他们继续沿着格兰特湖前进，爬上高地，可是沿着这个方向走了一英里，赛勒斯·哈丁仍未能找到这个瀑布，但是它必然存在于某处。","To return to the Chimneys, it was enough to cross the plateau obliquely for the space of a mile, and then to descend to the elbow formed by the first detour of the Mercy.But the engineer desired to know how and where the overplus of the water from the lake escaped, and the exploration was prolonged under the trees for a mile and a half towards the north.It was most probable that an overfall existed somewhere, and doubtless through a cleft in the granite.This lake was only, in short, an immense center basin, which was filled by degrees by the creek, and its waters must necessarily pass to the sea by some fall.If it was so, the engineer thought that it might perhaps be possible to utilize this fall and borrow its power, actually lost without profit to any one.They continued then to follow the shores of Lake Grant by climbing the plateau; but, after having gone a mile in this direction, Cyrus Harding had not been able to discover the overfall, which, however, must exist somewhere."
"这时已经四点半了。为了准备晚餐，居民们必须回到他们的住所。于是，这一小队人马按原路返回，赛勒斯·哈丁和他的同伴们沿着慈悲河左岸回到了“石窟”。","It was then half-past four.In order to prepare for dinner it was necessary that the settlers should return to their dwelling.The little band retraced their steps, therefore, and by the left bank of the Mercy, Cyrus Harding and his companions arrived at the Chimneys."
"篝火生起来了，纳布和潘克洛夫一个是黑人，一个是水手，厨师的职责自然转交给了他们，他们很快就准备好了烤刺鼠肉，大家对他们的手艺赞不绝口。","The fire was lighted, and Neb and Pencroft, on whom the functions of cooks naturally devolved, to the one in his quality of Negro, to the other in that of sailor, quickly prepared some broiled agouti, to which they did great justice."
"晚餐终于吃完了，大家正准备睡觉，赛勒斯·哈丁却从口袋里掏出几块小矿石样本来，他开口说道：","The repast at length terminated; at the moment when each one was about to give himself up to sleep, Cyrus Harding drew from his pocket little specimens of different sorts of minerals, and just said,—"
"“朋友们，这是铁矿石，这是黄铁矿石，这是粘土，这是石灰，这是煤。自然界给了我们这些东西。我们要好好地加以利用。明天我们就动手干吧。”","“My friends, this is iron mineral, this a pyrite, this is clay, this is lime, and this is coal.Nature gives us these things.It is our business to make a right use of them.To-morrow we will commence operations.”"
"第十三章","Chapter 13"
"“那么，哈丁先生，我们从哪里入手呢？”第二天早晨，潘克洛夫向工程师询问道。","“Well, captain, where are we going to begin?” asked Pencroft next morning of the engineer."
"“从头开始。”赛勒斯·哈丁回答道。","“At the beginning,” replied Cyrus Harding."
"事实上，居民们也不得不“从头开始”。他们甚至连制造工具的基本用具都没有，而且他们也不像大自然那样，“有的是时间，可以慢慢来”。他们没有时间可以消耗，因为他们必须准备生存所缺的急需品，虽然他们有许多经验，不需要发明创造，可一切都得亲自动手。铁和钢材只是处于矿石的状态，陶器不过是粘土的状态，亚麻布和衣服还只是纺织原料的状态。","And in fact, the settlers were compelled to begin “at the very beginning.”They did not possess even the tools necessary for making tools, and they were not even in the condition of nature, who, “having time, husbands her strength.”They had no time, since they had to provide for the immediate wants of their existence, and though, profiting by acquired experience, they had nothing to invent, still they had everything to make; their iron and their steel were as yet only in the state of minerals, their earthenware in the state of clay, their linen and their clothes in the state of textile material."
"然而必须指明一点，这些居民们都是完整的人，而且智力超群。工程师哈丁再也找不到比他们更为聪明的同伴，也找不到比他们更为热诚和充满奉献精神的同伴了。他已经彻底地试探了他们。他知晓每个人的能力。","It must be said, however, that the settlers were “men” in the complete and higher sense of the word.The engineer Harding could not have been seconded by more intelligent companions, nor with more devotion and zeal.He had tried them.He knew their abilities."
"吉丁·史佩莱是一个才思敏捷的记者，他无所不通，所以无所不谈。他的智慧和双手在开拓孤岛的过程中，可以做出巨大的贡献。他面对任何工作都不会退缩，这个意志坚定的运动健将，会把自己一向当作消遣的事情变成自己的职业。","Gideon Spilett, a talented reporter, having learned everything so as to be able to speak of everything, would contribute largely with his head and hands to the colonization of the island.He would not draw back from any task: a determined sportsman, he would make a business of what till then had only been a pleasure to him."
"赫伯特是一个勇敢的孩子，他的自然科学知识已经相当丰富，这可以给他们共同的事业带来更大的益处。","Herbert, a gallant boy, already remarkably well informed in the natural sciences, would render greater service to the common cause."
"纳布是忠诚的化身。他聪明、睿智，不屈不挠，身强体壮，有着钢铁一般的体魄，而且还懂得一些打铁的技术，所以一定会在开拓的过程中大展拳脚。","Neb was devotion personified.Clever, intelligent, indefatigable, robust, with iron health, he knew a little about the work of the forge, and could not fail to be very useful in the colony."
"至于潘克洛夫，他航行过各个海洋，在布鲁克林的造船所里当过木匠，在州船上当过助理裁缝，假期里还做过园丁、耕种者等等。像所有的水手一样，他什么都能干，而且知道怎么干。","As to Pencroft, he had sailed over every sea, a carpenter in the dockyards in Brooklyn, assistant tailor in the vessels of the state, gardener, cultivator, during his holidays, etc., and like all seamen, fit for anything, he knew how to do everything."
"这样的五个人凑在一起是很难得的，他们都很能和命运作斗争，而且取得胜利的可能性很大。","It would have been difficult to unite five men, better fitted to struggle against fate, more certain to triumph over it."
"“从头做起。”赛勒斯·哈丁已经说过了。工程师所谓的开头，就是先制造一个装备，可以用来改变天然的物质。热能在物质改变过程中所起的作用是人所共知众所周知的。目前燃料——木柴或是煤炭——可以随时取用，必须造一只炉子来利用这些燃料。","“At the beginning,” Cyrus Harding had said.Now this beginning of which the engineer spoke was the construction of an apparatus which would serve to transform the natural substances.The part which heat plays in these transformations is known.Now fuel, wood or coal, was ready for immediate use, an oven must be built to use it."
"“做炉子干什么用？”潘克洛夫问道。","“What is this oven for?” asked Pencroft."
"“用来烧制我们需要的陶器。”哈丁回答。","“To make the pottery which we have need of,” replied Harding."
"“那用什么做炉子呢？”","“And of what shall we make the oven?”"
"“用砖头。”","“With bricks.”"
"“哪里有砖头？”","“And the bricks?”"
"“用粘土做。开始吧，我的朋友们。为了省事，我们要把制造厂建在原料产地。纳布负责运送食物，会有足够的火来烹饪食物的。”","“With clay.Let us start, my friends.To save trouble, we will establish our manufactory at the place of production.Neb will bring provisions, and there will be no lack of fire to cook the food.”"
"“不，”记者回应道，“如果没有打猎的工具，怎么会有吃的东西呢？”","“No,” replied the reporter; “but if there is a lack of food for want of instruments for the chase?”"
"“啊，要是有一把刀就好了！”水手喊道。","“Ah, if we only had a knife!” cried the sailor."
"“是吗？”赛勒斯·哈丁问道。","“Well?” asked Cyrus Harding."
"“是啊！有了刀我就可以立刻做一副弓箭，那样我们的食品室里就有大量的猎物了！”","“Well!I would soon make a bow and arrows, and then there could be plenty of game in the larder!”"
"“是啊，一把刀，一把锋利的刀。”工程师自言自语道。","“Yes, a knife, a sharp blade.” said the engineer, as if he was speaking to himself."
"这时他的视线落到了托普身上，托普正在岸边四处奔跑。突然哈丁的脸变得神采奕奕了。","At this moment his eyes fell upon Top, who was running about on the shore.Suddenly Harding’s face became animated."
"“托普，过来！”他说道。","“Top, here,” said he."
"托普听见主人在叫它，就跑了回来。主人用两手托住托普的头，解下了它脖子上戴着的项圈，他将项圈折成两段，说：","The dog came at his master’s call.The latter took Top’s head between his hands, and unfastening the collar which the animal wore round his neck, he broke it in two, saying,—"
"“这有两把刀，潘克洛夫！”","“There are two knives, Pencroft!”"
"水手兴奋地欢呼了两声，作为回应。托普的项圈是用薄薄的回火钢片制成的。他们只需将它在沙石上磨锋利，并在较平滑的石头上磨出刀刃来就可以了。沙滩上有许多沙石，两个小时以后，聚居地的工具储备里就有两把快刀了，还很轻松地就装上了结实的刀柄。","Two hurrahs from the sailor was the reply.Top’s collar was made of a thin piece of tempered steel.They had only to sharpen it on a piece of sandstone, then to raise the edge on a finer stone.Now sandstone was abundant on the beach, and two hours after the stock of tools in the colony consisted of two sharp blades, which were easily fixed in solid handles."
"他们欢呼第一批工具成功制成了。这的确是他们宝贵的劳动成果，而且完成得恰是时候。他们出发了。","The production of these their first tools was hailed as a triumph.It was indeed a valuable result of their labor, and a very opportune one.They set out."
"赛勒斯·哈丁提议，他们应该去格兰特湖西岸，前一天他曾在那里注意到了粘土地面，还带回了一个标本。于是他们沿着慈悲河，穿过眺望岗，又走了五英里多的路，到达了一块林间空地，距离格兰特湖有200英尺远。","Cyrus Harding proposed that they should return to the western shore of the lake, where the day before he had noticed the clayey ground of which he possessed a specimen.They therefore followed the bank of the Mercy, traversed Prospect Heights, and alter a walk of five miles or more they reached a glade, situated two hundred feet from Lake Grant."
"赫伯特在路上发现了一种树木，南美洲的印第安人利用它的树枝制成弓。这就是克里井巴树，属于棕榈科，不能长出可食用的果实。他们砍了些又长又直的树枝，捋掉了树叶，削细了两头，中间则比较粗壮，只要再找到一种合适的植物做弓弦就大功告成了。结果他们找到了一棵木槿树，它的纤维非常结实，可以与动物身上的筋腱相媲美。于是，潘克洛夫就得到了一张相当有力量的弓，现在只缺箭了。箭杆倒是很容易做，只要找些又硬又直并且没有节的树枝就行。但是他们必须配备的箭头，也就是一些铁的代替品，却不太好找。但是潘克洛夫说他已经完成了自己分内的事，至于剩下的事情就要碰运气了。","On the way Herbert had discovered a tree, the branches of which the Indians of South America employ for making their bows.It was the crejimba, of the palm family, which does not bear edible fruit.Long straight branches were cut, the leaves stripped off; it was shaped, stronger in the middle, more slender at the extremities, and nothing remained to be done but to find a plant fit to make the bow-string.This was the “hibiscus heterophyllus,” which furnishes fibers of such remarkable tenacity that they have been compared to the tendons of animals.Pencroft thus obtained bows of tolerable strength, for which he only wanted arrows.These were easily made with straight stiff branches, without knots, but the points with which they must be armed, that is to say, a substance to serve in lieu of iron, could not be met with so easily.But Pencroft said, that having done his part of the work, chance would do the rest."
"居民们来到了前一天刚刚发现的地方。遍地的粘土对于制造砖瓦非常有用，对于他们正在讨论的事情也很有帮助。这项工作并不困难。只要用沙子滤掉粘土中的杂质，然后把粘土铸成砖形，接着用柴火的热度烧制就可以了。","The settlers arrived on the ground which had been discovered the day before.Being composed of the sort of clay which is used for making bricks and tiles, it was very useful for the work in question.There was no great difficulty in it.It was enough to scour the clay with sand, then to mold the bricks and bake them by the heat of a wood fire."
"通常来说，砖坯都是用模具成型的，但是工程师只能用手工制作。接下来的两天，他们一直在从事这项工作。粘土浸在水里，制作工人们手脚并用，把粘土搅拌好，然后把它们分成同等大小的方块。一个娴熟的工人不用机器，可以在十二个钟头里做一万块左右。可是，林肯岛上的这五位制砖工人，两天的时间里只做了不到三千块，这些砖坯一块块挨在一起，等到它们被完全烧干后，就可以用来砌炉子了，也就是说大概要三四天时间。","Generally bricks are formed in molds, but the engineer contented himself with making them by hand.All that day and the day following were employed in this work.The clay, soaked in water, was mixed by the feet and hands of the manipulators, and then divided into pieces of equal size.A practiced workman can make, without a machine, about ten thousand bricks in twelve hours; but in their two days work the five brickmakers on Lincoln Island had not made more than three thousand, which were ranged near each other, until the time when their complete desiccation would permit them to be used in building the oven, that is to say, in three or four days."
"4月2日那天，哈丁独自测定了海岛的方向，也就是说找到日出的准确方位。前一天，他已经准确记下了太阳消逝于地平线的时间，并且也考虑了折射的因素。这天早晨，他又一次精确地记录了日出的时间。日出与日落之间相隔12小时24分钟。那么，日出以后六小时十二分钟的时候，这一天的太阳应该恰好通过子午线，这时候它所在的天空位置应该是正北方向。到了上述提到的时间，赛勒斯标记出这一点，并把和太阳形成一条直线的两棵树做标记，这样，他就能为自己的秘密工作找出永恒不变的子午线。","It was on the 2nd of April that Harding had employed himself in fixing the orientation of the island, or, in other words, the precise spot where the sun rose.The day before he had noted exactly the hour when the sun disappeared beneath the horizon, making allowance for the refraction.This morning he noted, no less exactly, the hour at which it reappeared.Between this setting and rising twelve hours, twenty-four minutes passed.Then, six hours, twelve minutes after its rising, the sun on this day would exactly pass the meridian and the point of the sky which it occupied at this moment would be the north.At the said hour, Cyrus marked this point, and putting in a line with the sun two trees which would serve him for marks, he thus obtained an invariable meridian for his ulterior operations."
"在炉子做好的前两天里，居民们一直在收集燃料。他们砍下了林间空地附近的树枝，并捡起了所有掉在树下的树木。自从潘克洛夫有了几十枝带锋利箭头的箭后，他们打猎时也更加顺利了。是托普带回的这些箭头，它猎回了一只豪猪，这头豪猪的肉虽然很不好吃，但却非常有用，因为他的身上布满了硬刺。这些硬刺被牢固地安在箭头上，再加上些美冠鹦鹉的羽毛，射起箭来就更稳健了。记者和赫伯特很快就成为娴熟的射手了。“石窟”里因此有了各种各样的丰富猎物，有水豚、鸽子、刺鼠、松鸡等。大部分猎物都是从慈悲河左岸的森林里打来的，他们把这个森林叫做中南美鴷林，以此纪念第一次探险时，潘克洛夫和赫伯特追逐过的那只鸟。","The settlers employed the two days before the oven was built in collecting fuel.Branches were cut all round the glade, and they picked up all the fallen wood under the trees.They were also able to hunt with greater success, since Pencroft now possessed some dozen arrows armed with sharp points.It was Top who had famished these points, by bringing in a porcupine, rather inferior eating, but of great value, thanks to the quills with which it bristled.These quills were fixed firmly at the ends of the arrows, the flight of which was made more certain by some cockatoos’ feathers.The reporter and Herbert soon became very skilful archers.Game of all sorts in consequence abounded at the Chimneys, capybaras, pigeons, agouties, grouse, etc.The greater part of these animals were killed in the part of the forest on the left bank of the Mercy, to which they gave the name of Jacamar Wood, in remembrance of the bird which Pencroft and Herbert had pursued when on their first exploration."
"这些猎物是趁新鲜的时候吃的，但他们也保存了一些水豚腿。他们先用香气宜人的叶子把水豚腿裹上，然后再用青木柴火熏烤。虽然这种食物营养丰富，可总是烤来烤去的，大家还是期待能在火炉上听到汤水沸腾的声音，但这必须等到能够做出锅来，因此，那就要等到炉子造好了。","This game was eaten fresh, but they preserved some capybara hams, by smoking them above a fire of green wood, after having perfumed them with sweet-smelling leaves.However, this food, although very strengthening, was always roast upon roast, and the party would have been delighted to hear some soup bubbling on the hearth, but they must wait till a pot could be made, and, consequently, till the oven was built."
"这几次外出打猎时，他们都没有离开制砖厂太远。猎人们辨别出了某种体型庞大的动物新近留下的痕迹，脚爪很有力量，但是他们无法辨别是哪一类野兽。赛勒斯·哈丁建议大家小心谨慎，因为森林里可能有许多凶险的野兽。","During these excursions, which were not extended far from the brick-field, the hunters could discern the recent passage of animals of a large size, armed with powerful claws, but they could not recognize the species.Cyrus Harding advised them to be very careful, as the forest probably enclosed many dangerous beasts."
"他说的没错。事实上，有一天，吉丁·史佩莱和赫伯特看见了一只很像美洲豹的野兽。好在这只野兽并没有攻击他们，否则他们不可能不受重伤就逃脱。吉丁·史佩莱决定，只要他能得到一件正规的武器，也就是潘克洛夫一直想要的枪，就要和这些猛兽拼战到底，使它们从岛上彻底消失。","And he did right.Indeed, Gideon Spilett and Herbert one day saw an animal which resembled a jaguar.Happily the creature did not attack them, or they might not have escaped without a severe wound.As soon as he could get a regular weapon, that is to say, one of the guns which Pencroft begged for, Gideon Spilett resolved to make desperate war against the ferocious beasts, and exterminate them from the island."
"这些天他们并未对“石窟”做任何修缮，因为工程师希望能找到一个更加方便的居所，如有必要，他们可以自己建造一处。他们只好在通道的沙地上铺些地苔和干叶，疲倦的工人们在这些原始的床铺上睡得很沉。","The Chimneys during these few days was not made more comfortable, for the engineer hoped to discover, or build if necessary, a more convenient dwelling.They contented themselves with spreading moss and dry leaves on the sand of the passages, and on these primitive couches the tired workers slept soundly."
"他们也计算了一下在林肯岛上所度过的日子，从那时候开始，他们定期记录。4月5日是星期三，是风暴将这些落难者们抛上海岸以后的第12天。","They also reckoned the days they had passed on Lincoln Island, and from that time kept a regular account.The 5th of April, which was Wednesday, was twelve days from the time when the wind threw the castaways on this shore."
"4月6日，天刚刚亮，工程师就和他的同伴们在林间空地集合，他们打算在那里开始烧砖。正常来讲，这种工作应该在露天进行，而不是在窑里，确切地说，凝结的砖坯形成一个大窑，这样就可以自己烘干。他们用准备好的柴把作燃料，放在地上，并用烘干了的砖坯围住，这样就形成一个大的立方体，又在外部开了几个通气孔。这项工作持续了一整天，直到傍晚时分，他们才开始在柴把上生火。那一夜大家都没有睡，都全神贯注地照看柴火，使火持续燃烧。","On the 6th of April, at daybreak, the engineer and his companions were collected in the glade, at the place where they were going to perform the operation of baking the bricks.Naturally this had to be in the open air, and not in a kiln, or rather, the agglomeration of bricks made an enormous kiln, which would bake itself.The fuel, made of well-prepared fagots, was laid on the ground and surrounded with several rows of dried bricks, which soon formed an enormous cube, to the exterior of which they contrived air-holes.The work lasted all day, and it was not till the evening that they set fire to the fagots.No one slept that night, all watching carefully to keep up the fire."
"烧砖的过程整整持续了48小时，获得了完满的成功。接下来必须离开这个烟雾缭绕的混乱之地，等着烧热的砖坯冷却下来，在这段时间里，纳布和潘克洛夫在赛勒斯·哈丁的带领下，来到了湖的北岸，用交错的树枝编的筐子把那里遍布的石灰石和普通的石头运了一大堆回来。这些石头经过加热分解后，生成了很浓的生石灰，再经过沸化的过程，生石灰的体积迅速膨胀。它们的质地很纯，至少和白垩或大理石经过煅烧后生产的一样纯。石灰和细沙一搅拌就成了质量上乘的灰泥。","The operation lasted forty-eight hours, and succeeded perfectly.It then became necessary to leave the smoking mass to cool, and during this time Neb and Pencroft, guided by Cyrus Harding, brought, on a hurdle made of interlaced branches, loads of carbonate of lime and common stones, which were very abundant, to the north of the lake.These stones, when decomposed by heat, made a very strong quicklime, greatly increased by slacking, at least as pure as if it had been produced by the calcination of chalk or marble.Mixed with sand the lime made excellent mortar."
"这些不同的工作做好之后，到了4月9号，工程师就可以支配大量准备好的石灰和几千块砖头了。","The result of these different works was, that, on the 9th of April, the engineer had at his disposal a quantity of prepared lime and some thousands of bricks."
"他们丝毫也不敢懈怠，立刻开始砌窑烧制陶器，陶器可是他们日常生活中必不可少的部分。他们没遇到什么困难就成功了。五天以后，窑里就有煤供应了，煤是工程师在红河河口朝天的一个地方发现的。第一缕轻烟从20英尺高的烟囱里冒了出来。林间的空地被改造成了一个加工厂。潘克洛夫认为这个窑里可以生产出各种现代工业产品，这么想倒也不错。","Without losing an instant, therefore, they began the construction of a kiln to bake the pottery, which was indispensable for their domestic use.They succeeded without much difficulty.Five days after, the kiln was supplied with coal, which the engineer had discovered lying open to the sky towards the mouth of the Red Creek, and the first smoke escaped from a chimney twenty feet high.The glade was transformed into a manufactory, and Pencroft was not far wrong in believing that from this kiln would issue all the products of modern industry."
"居民们首先制成了一只普通的锅，作煮饭之用。主要的原料是粘土，哈丁又往里面加入了一些石灰和石英。这种湿粘土就成了常规的“陶土”，他们用适当形状的石头做模具，用这种土制成了碗、杯子，另外又做了一些盛水的大罐和大壶等等。这些陶器的形状很丑陋，还有些缺陷，但是经过高温焙烧以后，“石窟”的厨房里增添了许多器具，对于居民们来讲，这些器皿和最精美的釉瓷一样珍贵。在这里必须提到，潘克洛夫急切地想知道准备好的这种陶土是否配得上“陶土”的名字，于是他就做了几个大烟斗，结果很不错，可惜他没有烟草，这对潘克洛夫来讲真是巨大的损失。“烟草会有的，就像其他东西一样！”他以绝对的信心重复道。","In the meantime what the settlers first manufactured was a common pottery in which to cook their food.The chief material was clay, to which Harding added a little lime and quartz.This paste made regular “pipe-clay,” with which they manufactured bowls, cups molded on stones of a proper size, great jars and pots to hold water, etc.The shape of these objects was clumsy and defective, but after they had been baked in a high temperature, the kitchen of the Chimneys was provided with a number of utensils, as precious to the settlers as the most beautifully enameled china.We must mention here that Pencroft, desirous to know if the clay thus prepared was worthy of its name of pipe-clay, made some large pipes, which he thought charming, but for which, alas! he had no tobacco, and that was a great privation to Pencroft.“But tobacco will come, like everything else!” he repeated, in a burst of absolute confidence."
"这项工作一直持续到4月15日，时间利用得很好。居民们全都成了陶器工人，只做陶器。当赛勒斯·哈丁认为该做铁匠活了，那他们就会变成铁匠。但是第二天是星期日，而且也是复活节，所有人都同意休工一天以示这一天的神圣。这些美国人都是有宗教信仰的，都一丝不苟地遵循着圣经的箴言，而且他们的处境只能使他们信仰万物之主。","This work lasted till the 15th of April, and the time was well employed.The settlers, having become potters, made nothing but pottery.When it suited Cyrus Harding to change them into smiths, they would become smiths.But the next day being Sunday, and also Easter Sunday, all agreed to sanctify the day by rest.These Americans were religious men, scrupulous observers of the precepts of the Bible, and their situation could not but develop sentiments of confidence towards the Author of all things."
"4月15日傍晚，他们回到了“石窟”，带回了一些陶器，炉火已经熄灭，等有新的用途的时候，他们才重新点燃炉火。他们在归途中遇见了一件幸事，工程师发现了一种火绒的替代物。在一种多孔菌科的植物里，可以获取一种海绵状、光滑的菌肉。经过适当的加工，尤其是事先把它浸在火药里，或者是在硝酸盐或氯化钾的溶液里煮沸以后，这种菌子极易燃烧。但是以前他们没有找到这种多孔菌，也没有找到过一种可以替代它们的羊肚菌。这一天，工程师发现了一种艾草科的植物，主要品种有苦艾、香薄荷、龙蒿等等，他采集了几束，把它们递给了水手，说道：","On the evening of the 15th of April they returned to the Chimneys, carrying with them the pottery, the furnace being extinguished until they could put it to a new use.Their return was marked by a fortunate incident; the engineer discovered a substance which replaced tinder.It is known that a spongy, velvety flesh is procured from a certain mushroom of the genus polyporous.Properly prepared, it is extremely inflammable, especially when it has been previously saturated with gunpowder, or boiled in a solution of nitrate or chlorate of potash.But, till then, they had not found any of these polypores or even any of the morels which could replace them.On this day, the engineer, seeing a plant belonging to the wormwood genus, the principal species of which are absinthe, balm-mint, tarragon, etc., gathered several tufts, and, presenting them to the sailor, said,—"
"“给你，潘克洛夫，这个能使你开心。”","“Here, Pencroft, this will please you.”"
"潘克洛夫仔细地看了看植物，这种植物上有许多光滑的长须，叶子上长满松软的绒毛。","Pencroft looked attentively at the plant, covered with long silky hair, the leaves being clothed with soft down."
"“这是什么，先生？”潘克洛夫问道，“是烟草吗？”","“What’s that, captain?” asked Pencroft.“Is it tobacco?”"
"“不是，”哈丁答道，“是艾草，学者们称之为中国艾草，对于我们，它将是火绒。”","“No,” replied Harding, “it is wormwood; Chinese wormwood to the learned, but to us it will be tinder.”"
"等艾草晒干，尤其是工程师后来把它放在硝酸盐溶液里浸泡以后，它就为他们提供了极易燃烧的物质了。这个岛上有一些矿床，事实上也就是硝石。","When the wormwood was properly dried it provided them with a very inflammable substance, especially afterwards when the engineer had impregnated it with nitrate of potash, of which the island possessed several beds, and which is in truth saltpeter."
"这一晚，开拓者们吃了丰盛的晚餐。纳布准备了刺鼠肉汤，一只熏水豚腿，他还在熏腿上加了些煮熟的“贝母属”块茎，这是白星海芋科的草本植物。它们很美味，而且很有营养，和英国出售的、被称为“波特兰西米”的东西类似。它们也是面包的上好替代品，林肯岛上的居民们直到现在还没有面包。","The colonists had a good supper that evening.Neb prepared some agouti soup, a smoked capybara ham, to which was added the boiled tubercules of the “caladium macrorhizum,” an herbaceous plant of the arum family.They had an excellent taste, and were very nutritious, being something similar to the substance which is sold in England under the name of “Portland sago”; they were also a good substitute for bread, which the settlers in Lincoln Island did not yet possess."
"晚餐过后，在睡觉以前，哈丁和同伴们到沙滩上散步，这时是晚上八点，夜色很美。月亮还未升起，这已是满月后的第五天，但是地平线上已经布上了银白色的柔光，那可以称作是月亮的“曙光”。南边的苍穹顶上，围绕极地的星座在闪闪发光，其中最闪亮的就是南十字座。几天前，工程师曾在富兰克林山顶上看见过它。","When supper was finished, before sleeping, Harding and his companions went to take the air on the beach. it was eight o’clock in the evening; the night was magnificent.The moon, which had been full five days before, had not yet risen, but the horizon was already silvered by those soft, pale shades which might be called the dawn of the moon.At the southern zenith glittered the circumpolar constellations, and above all the Southern Cross, which some days before the engineer had greeted on the summit of Mount Franklin."
"赛勒斯·哈丁久久凝视着这个美丽的星座，两颗一等星分别在它的顶端和基部，左边有颗二等星，右变则是一颗三等星。","Cyrus Harding gazed for some time at this splendid constellation, which has at its summit and at its base two stars of the first magnitude, at its left arm a star of the second, and at its right arm a star of the third magnitude."
"他思考了几分钟，然后说：","Then, after some minutes thought—"
"“赫伯特，”他问少年，“今天是4月15日吗？”","“Herbert,” he asked of the lad, “is not this the 15th of April?”"
"“是的，上尉。”赫伯特回答。","“Yes, captain,” replied Herbert."
"“那么，如果我没记错，明天会是一年当中实际时间和平均时间完全相等的四天之一，也就是说，孩子，明天太阳会在正午12点时经过子午线，误差在几秒之内。如果天气晴好，我想我可以大致准确地计算出海岛的经度，至多有几度的误差而已。”","“Well, if I am not mistaken, to-morrow will be one of the four days in the year in which the real time is identical with average time; that is to say, my boy, that to-morrow, to within some seconds, the sun will pass the meridian just at midday by the clocks.If the weather is fine I think that I shall obtain the longitude of the island with an approximation of some degrees.”"
"“不用仪器，不用六分仪吗？”吉丁·史佩莱问道。","“Without instruments, without sextant?” asked Gideon Spilett."
"“不用，”工程师答道，“而且今晚夜空晴朗，所以我今晚就要试着计算出我们所在的纬度，通过计算南十字星座的高度，也就是根据地平线上的南极点。朋友们，要知道在没有仔细地进行安置工作以前，还不能确定这片陆地是一个孤岛。我们必须尽可能精确地知道，它与美洲大陆、澳洲大陆或是太平洋主要群岛之间的距离。”","“Yes,” replied the engineer.“Also, since the night is clear, I will try, this very evening, to obtain our latitude by calculating the height of the Southern Cross, that is, from the southern pole above the horizon.You understand, my friends, that before undertaking the work of installation in earnest it is not enough to have found out that this land is an island; we must, as nearly as possible, know at what distance it is situated, either from the American continent or Australia, or from the principal archipelagoes of the Pacific.”"
"“不错”，记者说，“如果我们碰巧离有人居住的海岸不到100英里，那造一只船可就要比建一所房子重要多了。”","“In fact,” said the reporter, “instead of building a house it would be more important to build a boat, if by chance we are not more than a hundred miles from an inhabited coast.”"
"“因此，”哈丁说，“我要在今晚设法计算出林肯岛的纬度，明天中午我再设法计算出经度。”","“That is why,” returned Harding, “I am going to try this evening to calculate the latitude of Lincoln Island, and to-morrow, at midday, I will try to calculate the longitude.”"
"如果工程师手里有一个六分仪——能够精确测量物体之间夹角距离的仪器，这项工作就能轻而易举地完成了。今晚通过南极点的高度，明天通过经过子午线的太阳，他就能知道海岛的位置了。但是由于他们没有六分仪，他只好自己来填补这个缺陷了。","If the engineer had possessed a sextant, an apparatus with which the angular distance of objects can be measured with great precision, there would have been no difficulty in the operation.This evening by the height of the pole, the next day by the passing of the sun at the meridian, he would obtain the position of the island.But as they had not one he would have to supply the deficiency."
"于是，哈丁回到了“石窟”。他借着火光，削了两把小平尺，然后将它们的一端连在一起，做成一副圆规，圆规的两脚可以分开或合拢。连接点是用一个结实的洋槐树刺固定的，是从柴堆里找到的。做好了仪器之后，工程师又回到了海滩。可是要测量极点的高度需要在没有云的水平线上进行，也就是要在海平线上测量，但是爪角挡住了南方的水平线，他只好去找一个更为合适的地点。最理想的场所自然要正对着南方的海岸，可是又要渡过慈悲河，这是困难所在。因此，哈丁决定在眺望岗上进行观察，这就要把高地的海拔考虑在内，他打算第二天运用基本的几何知识来计算高地的海拔。","Harding then entered the Chimneys.By the light of the fire he cut two little flat rulers, which he joined together at one end so as to form a pair of compasses, whose legs could separate or come together.The fastening was fixed with a strong acacia thorn which was found in the wood pile.This instrument finished, the engineer returned to the beach, but as it was necessary to take the height of the pole from above a clear horizon, that is, a sea horizon, and as Claw Cape hid the southern horizon, he was obliged to look for a more suitable station.The best would evidently have been the shore exposed directly to the south; but the Mercy would have to be crossed, and that was a difficulty.Harding resolved, in consequence, to make his observation from Prospect Heights, taking into consideration its height above the level of the sea—a height which he intended to calculate next day by a simple process of elementary geometry."
"于是，居民们爬上慈悲河的左岸，向着高地的方向进发。他们站在从西北到东南方向的高地边缘，也就是沿河一带奇形怪状的岩石上。","The settlers, therefore, went to the plateau, ascending the left bank of the Mercy, and placed themselves on the edge which looked northwest and southeast, that is, above the curiously-shaped rocks which bordered the river."
"这一带高地俯瞰着慈悲河左岸的山岗，山岗斜向爪角的尽头，一直延伸到海岛的南部。没有障碍物阻拦他们的视线，他们横扫从爪角到爬虫角整个半圆形的水平线。南边的水平线在初升月亮的光线映照下，十分清晰地显现在天际。","This part of the plateau commanded the heights of the left bank, which sloped away to the extremity of Claw Cape, and to the southern side of the island.No obstacle intercepted their gaze, which swept the horizon in a semi-circle from the cape to Reptile End.To the south the horizon, lighted by the first rays of the moon, was very clearly defined against the sky."
"这时，南十字星座以倒置的形状呈现在观测者的眼前，主星标识出星座的底部，处于离南极较近的地方。","At this moment the Southern Cross presented itself to the observer in an inverted position, the star Alpha marking its base, which is nearer to the southern pole."
"这个星座与南极的距离要比北极星与北极的距离远。主星大约在距离南极27度的方位上，但是赛勒斯·哈丁知道这一点，并已在计算时把这个角度考虑在内了。他也仔细地观察了主星经过正对着南极的子午线的时刻，这会使操作更加简单。","This constellation is not situated as near to the antarctic pole as the Polar Star is to the arctic pole.The star Alpha is about twenty-seven degrees from it, but Cyrus Harding knew this and made allowance for it in his calculation.He took care also to observe the moment when it passed the meridian below the pole, which would simplify the operation."
"赛勒斯·哈丁把圆规的一脚对着水平线，另一脚对着主星，两只脚之间的空间就形成了主星和水平线之间的角距。为了固定所得的角度，他用刺针把一个木条横向钉在圆规的两只脚上，这样就可以恰当保留它们之间的角距了。","Cyrus Harding pointed one leg of the compasses to the horizon, the other to Alpha, and the space between the two legs gave him the angular distance which separated Alpha from the horizon.In order to fix the angle obtained, he fastened with thorns the two pieces of wood on a third placed transversely, so that their separation should be properly maintained."
"这一步完成以后，只要再计算角度就可以了。但这还要到海平面上去观察，因为还要把水平线的俯角考虑在内，这就有必要测量一下峭壁的高度。有了这个角度就可以算出主星的高度，继而可以算出极点在水平线上的高度，即海岛的纬度，因为地球上任何一点的纬度都等于这点在水平线上的高度。","That done, there was only the angle to calculate by bringing back the observation to the level of the sea, taking into consideration the depression of the horizon, which would necessitate measuring the height of the cliff.The value of this angle would give the height of Alpha, and consequently that of the pole above the horizon, that is to say, the latitude of the island, since the latitude of a point of the globe is always equal to the height of the pole above the horizon of this point."
"计算的事留待第二天解决，十点钟时，大家都沉沉地睡着了。","The calculations were left for the next day, and at ten o’clock every one was sleeping soundly."
"第十四章","Chapter 14"
"第二天是4月16日，也就是复活节星期日，居民们破晓时分就走出了“石窟”去洗亚麻布衣服。工程师打算只要找到必要的原料——苏打或是碳酸钾，脂肪或是油，就制造肥皂。至于置换新衣物这个重要的问题，就要留到一个合适的时间和地点来探讨了。他们的衣服至少可以支撑六个月，因为衣服很结实，经得住体力劳动的磨损。但是一切取决于海岛是否靠近有人居住的陆地。如果天气允许，这个问题今天就能得到解决。","The next day, the 16th of April, and Easter Sunday, the settlers issued from the Chimneys at daybreak, and proceeded to wash their linen.The engineer intended to manufacture soap as soon as he could procure the necessary materials—soda or potash, fat or oil.The important question of renewing their wardrobe would be treated of in the proper time and place.At any rate their clothes would last at least six months longer, for they were strong, and could resist the wear of manual labor.But all would depend on the situation of the island with regard to inhabited land.This would be settled to-day if the weather permitted."
"太阳从清晰的水平线升起，预示着一个晴好的天气，美丽的秋日似乎在与温暖的季节做最后的告别。","The sun rising above a clear horizon, announced a magnificent day, one of those beautiful autumn days which are like the last farewells of the warm season."
"现在需要完成前一晚的观察了，要测量出峭壁的海拔。","It was now necessary to complete the observations of the evening before by measuring the height of the cliff above the level of the sea."
"“你不需要一个昨晚那样的仪器吗？”赫伯特问工程师。","“Shall you not need an instrument similar to the one which you used yesterday?” said Herbert to the engineer."
"“不需要，孩子，”工程师回答，“我们今天要换种方式进行，但像昨天一样精确。”","“No, my boy,” replied the latter, “we are going to proceed differently, but in as precise a way.”"
"赫伯特跟着工程师一起前往海滨，他想尽量学会每件事。潘克洛夫、纳布和记者则留在原地，干着不同的事。","Herbert, wishing to learn everything he could, followed the engineer to the beach.Pencroft, Neb, and the reporter remained behind and occupied themselves in different ways."
"赛勒斯·哈丁准备了一个12英尺长的直木杆，长度是通过对比自己的身高精确地计算出来的，他对自己的身高可是知道得分毫不差。赫伯特拿着哈丁交给他的垂线，其实就是将一块普通的石头系在了质地柔韧的植物末端。他们到达的地方距海边20英尺，距高耸的峭壁近500英尺，哈丁把木杆插入沙地二英尺深，并小心地插牢，然后利用垂线使木杆和地面保持垂直。","Cyrus Harding had provided himself with a straight stick, twelve feet long, which he had measured as exactly as possible by comparing it with his own height, which he knew to a hair.Herbert carried a plumb-line which Harding had given him, that is to say, a simple stone fastened to the end of a flexible fiber.Having reached a spot about twenty feet from the edge of the beach, and nearly five hundred feet from the cliff, which rose perpendicularly, Harding thrust the pole two feet into the sand, and wedging it up carefully, he managed, by means of the plumb-line, to erect it perpendicularly with the plane of the horizon."
"完成了这个步骤，他退后了一段距离，然后躺在沙滩上，眼睛同时看着木杆的顶端和峭壁的上沿。他用一根小棍子仔细地在观察点做记号。","That done, he retired the necessary distance, when, lying on the sand, his eye glanced at the same time at the top of the pole and the crest of the cliff.He carefully marked the place with a little stick."
"然后他问赫伯特：“你知道最基本的几何原理吗？”","Then addressing Herbert—“Do you know the first principles of geometry?” he asked."
"“知道一点儿，上尉。”赫伯特回答，他可不想炫耀自己。","“Slightly, captain,” replied Herbert, who did not wish to put himself forward."
"“那你记得两个相似三角形的性质吗？”","“You remember what are the properties of two similar triangles?”"
"“记得，”赫伯特答道，“它们的对应边成比例。”","“Yes,” replied Herbert; “their homologous sides are proportional.”"
"“很好，孩子。我刚刚做了两个相似的直角三角形，第一个较小，它的三条边分别是：那根垂直的木杆和从这跟小棍子到木杆底部的距离，我的视线则是三角形的斜边；第二个三角形的三条边分别是：我们想测量高度的垂直峭壁，这根小棍子和峭壁底部之间的距离，我的视线同样形成三角形的斜边，这个斜边是第一个三角形斜边的延长线。”","“Well, my boy, I have just constructed two similar right-angled triangles; the first, the smallest, has for its sides the perpendicular pole, the distance which separates the little stick from the foot of the pole and my visual ray for hypothenuse; the second has for its sides the perpendicular cliff, the height of which we wish to measure, the distance which separates the little stick from the bottom of the cliff, and my visual ray also forms its hypothenuse, which proves to be prolongation of that of the first triangle.”"
"“噢，上尉，我懂了！”赫伯特大声喊道，“小棍子和木杆之间的距离与小棍子和峭壁底部之间的距离之比，就等于木杆的高度和峭壁的高度之比。”","“Ah, captain, I understand!” cried Herbert.“As the distance from the stick to the pole is to the distance from the stick to the base of the cliff, so is the height of the pole to the height of the cliff.”"
"“就是这样，赫伯特，”工程师答道，“当我们测量了前两段距离和木杆的长度，只要按照比例一算，就可以求出峭壁的高度了，这样就省去了我们直接测量的麻烦。”","“Just so, Herbert,” replied the engineer; “and when we have measured the two first distances, knowing the height of the pole, we shall only have a sum in proportion to do, which will give us the height of the cliff, and will save us the trouble of measuring it directly.”"
"两段水平距离可以通过木杆量出，木杆在沙滩以上部分的高度恰好为十英尺。","The two horizontal distances were found out by means of the pole, whose length above the sand was exactly ten feet."
"第一段距离为15英尺，是小棍子到木杆在沙上所插位置的距离。","The first distance was fifteen feet between the stick and the place where the pole was thrust into the sand."
"第二段为500英尺，是小棍子到峭壁底部的距离。","The second distance between the stick and the bottom of the cliff was five hundred feet."
"完成这些测量后，赛勒斯·哈丁和少年就回石窟了。","These measurements finished, Cyrus Harding and the lad returned to the Chimneys."
"工程师拿出一块扁平的石头，是他上次外出时带回来的，这是一种板岩，用锋利的贝壳可以很容易地在上面划出字符来。他求出了以下的比例关系：","The engineer then took a flat stone which he had brought back from one of his previous excursions, a sort of slate, on which it was easy to trace figures with a sharp shell.He then proved the following proportions:—"
"15：500＝10：X","15:500::10:x"
"500×10＝5000","500 x 10 = 5000"
"5000/15＝333.3","5000 15 = 333.3"
"由此可以得出，花岗石峭壁的高度为333英尺。","From which it was proved that the granite cliff measured 333 feet in height."
"赛勒斯·哈丁又拿出了前晚所做的仪器，圆规两脚之间的距离就是主星和水平线之间的角距。他先是把一个圆周分为360等份，然后把圆规的角度准确地落在圆周上。现在，这个角度加上主星距离南极的27度，再减去观察时所在的峭壁海拔，就得出了一个53度的角。90度减去53度就是南极到赤道的距离，也就是37度。因此，赛勒斯·哈丁得出的结论是林肯岛在南纬37度，如果把测量时的误差也考虑在内，大概是五度左右，那么海岛的位置一定是在南纬35度与40度之间。","Cyrus Harding then took the instrument which he had made the evening before, the space between its two legs giving the angular distance between the star Alpha and the horizon.He measured, very exactly, the opening of this angle on a circumference which he divided into 360 equal parts.Now, this angle by adding to it the twenty-seven degrees which separated Alpha from the antarctic pole, and by reducing to the level of the sea the height of the cliff on which the observation had been made, was found to be fifty-three degrees.These fifty-three degrees being subtracted from ninety degrees—the distance from the pole to the equator—there remained thirty-seven degrees.Cyrus Harding concluded, therefore, that Lincoln Island was situated on the thirty-seventh degree of the southern latitude, or taking into consideration through the imperfection of the performance, an error of five degrees, that it must be situated between the thirty-fifth and the fortieth parallel."
"现在只要计算出经度，海岛的位置就可以确定了。工程师打算在这一天的中午十二点钟，在太阳经过子午线的时候尝试一下。","There was only the longitude to be obtained, and the position of the island would be determined, The engineer hoped to attempt this the same day, at twelve o’clock, at which moment the sun would pass the meridian."
"大家决定星期日徒步旅行，或者说是远足探险，要去湖的北边和鲨鱼湾之间的地带。如果时间允许，他们就会继续去南颚角的北边探险。他们打算在沙丘上吃早饭，直到傍晚才会返回。","It was decided that Sunday should be spent in a walk, or rather an exploring expedition, to that side of the island between the north of the lake and Shark Gulf, and if there was time they would push their discoveries to the northern side of Cape South Mandible.They would breakfast on the downs, and not return till evening."
"八点半的时候，这一小队人马沿着海峡的边缘前进。海峡对面的安全岛上，许多水鸟神情庄重地高视阔步。这些是潜水鸟，可以从其叫声中轻易辨别出来，那很像驴叫的声音。潘克洛夫只是从吃的角度来考察它们，因此当他得知这些鸟的肉虽有些黑但味道还行时，他感到很满意。","At half-past eight the little band was following the edge of the channel.On the other side, on Safety Islet, numerous birds were gravely strutting.They were divers, easily recognized by their cry, which much resembles the braying of a donkey.Pencroft only considered them in an eatable point of view, and learnt with some satisfaction that their flesh, though blackish, is not bad food."
"他们还看见了一些巨大的两栖动物在沙地上爬行，那无疑是海豹，它们似乎已选择这个小岛作为庇护所了。这些动物是不可能从营养角度看的，因为它们的肉油腻腻的，令人恶心。然而，赛勒斯·哈丁仔细地观察着它们，也没说出他的想法，只是告诉同伴们，不久他们要去一次小岛。海滩上遍布着数不清的贝壳，其中一些贝壳一定会令贝壳学家心花怒放的，其中有雉螺、三角蛤等。但纳布有更为有用的发现，在退潮的时候，他在岩石间看见了一大片牡蛎场，离“石窟”将近五英里。","Great amphibious creatures could also be seen crawling on the sand; seals, doubtless, who appeared to have chosen the islet for a place of refuge.It was impossible to think of those animals in an alimentary point of view, for their oily flesh is detestable; however, Cyrus Harding observed them attentively, and without making known his idea, he announced to his companions that very soon they would pay a visit to the islet.The beach was strewn with innumerable shells, some of which would have rejoiced the heart of a conchologist; there were, among others, the phasianella, the terebratual, etc.But what would be of more use, was the discovery, by Neb, at low tide, of a large oysterbed among the rocks, nearly five miles from the Chimneys."
"“纳布今天可没白过。”潘克洛夫看着眼前一大片的牡蛎场喊道。","“Neb will not have lost his day,” cried Pencroft, looking at the spacious oyster-bed."
"“这可是个幸运的发现，”记者说，“据说每只牡蛎每年能产五万到六万个卵，这样我们就有取之不尽的食物供应了。”","“It is really a fortunate discovery,” said the reporter, “and as it is said that each oyster produces yearly from fifty to sixty thousand eggs, we shall have an inexhaustible supply there.”"
"“只是我觉得牡蛎营养不太丰富。”赫伯特说道。","“Only I believe that the oyster is not very nourishing,” said Herbert."
"“没错，”哈丁答道，“牡蛎所含的氮很少，如果一个成年人只靠牡蛎生活，那每天至少要吃15到16打才行。”","“No,” replied Harding.“The oyster contains very little nitrogen, and if a man lived exclusively on them, he would have to eat not less than fifteen to sixteen dozen a day.”"
"“好极了！”潘克洛夫说，“我们可以成打成打地吃，反正也吃不尽。我们要不要带一些当早饭？”","“Capital!” replied Pencroft.“We might swallow dozens and dozens without exhausting the bed.Shall we take some for breakfast?”"
"因为知道大家会赞成这个提议，水手和纳布不等大家回答，就捡了一大堆牡蛎。他们把牡蛎装进一个网袋里，这是纳布用木槿纤维做的，袋里原来就装了些食物。然后，他们继续爬上沙丘和大海之间的海岸。","And without waiting for a reply to this proposal, knowing that it would be approved of, the sailor and Neb detached a quantity of the molluscs.They put them in a sort of net of hibiscus fiber, which Neb had manufactured, and which already contained food; they then continued to climb the coast between the downs and the sea."
"哈丁时不时地看看表，以便为及时观察太阳做好准备，这项工作必须在正午进行。","From time to time Harding consulted his watch, so as to be prepared in time for the solar observation, which had to be made exactly at midday."
"海岛的这个部分全都很荒芜，一直到联合湾尽头都是如此，那里已被命名为南颚角。那里什么也看不见，尽是些沙石和贝壳，还混杂着一些熔岩的碎片。一些海鸟时常光顾这个荒凉的海岸，有海鸥、巨大的信天翁和野鸭，潘克洛夫对这些都很喜欢。他试图用箭射下几只，但是毫无收获，因为野鸭很少栖息在某处，而他又不会在海鸟飞行时射中目标。","All that part of the island was very barren as far as the point which closed Union Bay, and which had received the name of Cape South Mandible.Nothing could be seen there but sand and shells, mingled with debris of lava.A few sea-birds frequented this desolate coast, gulls, great albatrosses, as well as wild duck, for which Pencroft had a great fancy.He tried to knock some over with an arrow, but without result, for they seldom perched, and he could not hit them on the wing."
"于是，水手又对工程师说道：","This led the sailor to repeat to the engineer,—"
"“你看，上尉，如果没有一两支猎枪，我们绝不会打到任何东西！”","“You see, captain, so long as we have not one or two fowling-pieces, we shall never get anything!”"
"“那是自然，潘克洛夫，”记者说，“但这就要看你的了。如果你能找来些铁做枪身，钢做撞针，硝石、炭和硫磺做火药，水银和硝酸做雷粉，铅做子弹，那么哈丁上尉就能为我们制造出一流的枪支。”","“Doubtless, Pencroft,” replied the reporter, “but it depends on you.Procure us some iron for the barrels, steel for the hammers, saltpeter. coal and sulphur for powder, mercury and nitric acid for the fulminate, and lead for the shot, and the captain will make us first-rate guns.”"
"“哦！”工程师答道，“可以肯定，我们能在岛上找到这些东西，但是枪构造精细，需要特殊工具才行。所以，只能等到以后再说了！”","“Oh!” replied the engineer, “we might, no doubt, find all these substances on the island, but a gun is a delicate instrument, and needs very particular tools.However, we shall see later!”"
"“那么，”潘克洛夫喊道，“为什么我们当时要把吊舱中的所有武器、所有器具，甚至是小折刀都扔掉呢？”","“Why,” cried Pencroft, “were we obliged to throw overboard all the weapons we had with us in the car, all our implements, even our pocket-knives?”"
"“但如果当时不把它们扔出去，潘克洛夫，气球就要把我们扔到海底了！”赫伯特说道。","“But if we had not thrown them away, Pencroft, the balloon would have thrown us to the bottom of the sea!” said Herbert."
"“你说得很对，孩子。”水手应道。","“What you say is true, my boy,” replied the sailor."
"水手又想到了另外一件事。“你想，”他说，“如果乔纳森·福斯特和他的伙伴们第二天早晨发现那里空空如也，气球也飞走了，该有多吃惊啊！”","Then passing to another idea,—“Think,” said he, “how astounded Jonathan Forster and his companions must have been when, next morning, they found the place empty, and the machine flown away!”"
"“我可完全不关心他们怎么想。”记者说。","“I am utterly indifferent about knowing what they may have thought,” said the reporter."
"“那可都是我的主意呢！”潘克洛夫得意地说。","“It was all my idea, that!” said Pencroft, with a satisfied air."
"“多好的主意啊，潘克洛夫！”吉丁·史佩莱笑道，“它把我们全都送到这里来了。”","“A splendid idea, Pencroft!” replied Gideon Spilett, laughing, “and which has placed us where we are.”"
"“我宁愿在这里，也不愿意落在南方人的手里，”水手大声喊道，“尤其是哈丁先生有幸重新回到了我们身边。”","“I would rather be here than in the hands of the Southerners,” cried the sailor, “especially since the captain has been kind enough to come and join us again.”"
"“我也这么想，真的！”记者应道，“而且，我们还缺什么呢？什么都不缺。”","“So would I, truly!” replied the reporter.“Besides, what do we want?Nothing.”"
"“如果不是在这里，那我们什么都缺！”潘克洛夫耸了耸肩，笑着说道，“但是，总有那么一天，我们会找到离开的法子！”","“If that is not—everything!” replied Pencroft, laughing and shrugging his shoulders.“But, some day or other, we shall find means of going away!”"
"“也许，朋友们，这一天会比你们想象的来得更早，”工程师说，“如果林肯岛距离有人居住的海岛或是大陆不算太远。一个小时以后，我们就能知道是否如此了。我没有太平洋的地图，但是我的脑海里清楚地记得太平洋南部的地理情况。根据我昨天测出的纬度来看，林肯岛西边应该是新西兰，东边则是智利的海岸。但是这两个国家之间的距离至少有六千英里。因此，必须确定这个海岛在这大片海洋中的哪一点。我们马上就可以从经度上得知这一点，我希望结果会相当准确。”","“Sooner, perhaps, than you imagine, my friends,” remarked the engineer, “if Lincoln Island is but a medium distance from an inhabited island, or from a continent.We shall know in an hour.I have not a map of the Pacific, but my memory has preserved a very clear recollection of its southern part.The latitude which I obtained yesterday placed New Zealand to the west of Lincoln Island, and the coast of Chile to the east.But between these two countries, there is a distance of at least six thousand miles.It has, therefore, to be determined what point in this great space the island occupies, and this the longitude will give us presently, with a sufficient approximation, I hope.”"
"“帕摩图群岛是同纬度上离我们最近的点吗？”赫伯特问道。","“Is not the archipelago of the Pomoutous the nearest point to us in latitude?” asked Herbert."
"“是的，”工程师答道，“但我们距它还有1200英里以上。”","“Yes,” replied the engineer, “but the distance which separates us from it is more than twelve hundred miles.”"
"“那边呢？”纳布指着南方问道，他对这个话题兴致勃勃。","“And that way?” asked Neb, who followed the conversation with extreme interest, pointing to the south."
"“那边，什么都没有。”潘克洛夫回答。","“That way, nothing,” replied Pencroft."
"“的确什么都没有。”工程师补充道。","“Nothing, indeed,” added the engineer."
"“那么，赛勒斯，”记者问道，“如果林肯岛距离新西兰或智利不到两三千英里呢？”","“Well, Cyrus,” asked the reporter, “if Lincoln Island is not more than two or three thousand miles from New Zealand or Chile?”"
"“那么，”工程师答道，“我们就不盖房子了，改为造船，就由潘克洛夫船长来指挥。”","“Well,” replied the engineer, “instead of building a house we will build a boat, and Master Pencroft shall be put in command—”"
"“太好了，”水手喊道，“我早就准备好当船长了，就等你做一只可以航海的船了。”","“Well then,” cried the sailor, “I am quite ready to be captain—as soon as you can make a craft that’s able to keep at sea!”"
"“如果需要，我们就造一只。”赛勒斯·哈丁回答。","“We shall do it, if it is necessary,” replied Cyrus Harding."
"这些人遇事向来果断，但正当他们聊天的时候，观测的时间已经快到了。赛勒斯·哈丁不用任何仪器，将如何确定太阳通过海岛子午线的路线，赫伯特怎么也猜不透。","But while these men, who really hesitated at nothing, were talking, the hour approached at which the observation was to be made.What Cyrus Harding was to do to ascertain the passage of the sun at the meridian of the island, without an instrument of any sort, Herbert could not guess."
"这时观察者们距离“石窟”大概六英里远，距工程师不可思议地获救后他们找到的那片沙丘不远。他们在这里停了下来，开始准备早餐，因为已经十一点半了。赫伯特去附近的小溪找了些淡水，用纳布准备的水壶装了回来。","The observers were then about six miles from the Chimneys, not far from that part of the downs in which the engineer had been found after his enigmatical preservation.They halted at this place and prepared for breakfast, for it was half-past eleven.Herbert went for some fresh water from a stream which ran near, and brought it back in a jug, which Neb had provided."
"趁着准备吃饭的空当，哈丁安排好了天文观测的一切。他选了海滨一处开阔的空地，落潮以后这里的地面十分平整。这片细沙地像冰面一样平滑，没有一粒沙子格格不入。地面是否水平无关紧要，插在地上的六英尺木杆是否和地面垂直也不太要紧。相反，工程师将它斜向了南边，也就是海滨背向太阳的方向，因为必须牢记的一点是海岛位于南半球，所以林肯岛上的居民所看见的光芒四射的星球，运行的弧线是在北边的水平线上，而非南边。","During these preparations Harding arranged everything for his astronomical observation.He chose a clear place on the shore, which the ebbing tide had left perfectly level.This bed of fine sand was as smooth as ice, not a grain out of place.It was of little importance whether it was horizontal or not, and it did not matter much whether the stick six feet high, which was planted there, rose perpendicularly.On the contrary, the engineer inclined it towards the south, that is to say, in the direction of the coast opposite to the sun, for it must not be forgotten that the settlers in Lincoln Island, as the island was situated in the Southern Hemisphere, saw the radiant planet describe its diurnal arc above the northern, and not above the southern horizon."
"现在赫伯特知道工程师打算如何确定太阳的顶点，也就是经过海岛子午线的方位，换句话说，就是确定当地的正南方。他是通过测量木杆在沙地上的投影，在没有仪器时，这是可以得到他所需要的精确结果的适合方式。","Herbert now understood how the engineer was going to proceed to ascertain the culmination of the sun, that is to say its passing the meridian of the island or, in other words, determine due south.It was by means of the shadow cast on the sand by the stick, a way which, for want of an instrument, would give him a suitable approach to the result which he wished to obtain."
"事实上，当影子的长度最短时，应该是正午十二点，只要观察影子的末端，就可以确定影子逐渐缩短之后又开始拉长的那一瞬间。赛勒斯·哈丁把木杆偏向和太阳相对的方向，这样可以使影子长一些，因此可以更容易地看到它的变化。事实上，日晷的时针愈长，就愈容易辨别指针的移动。木杆的影子也就是日晷上的指针。时间到了，赛勒斯·哈丁跪在沙地上，把一个个小木桩插在沙地上做记号，开始记录木杆影子逐渐缩短的过程。他的同伴们弯下腰，怀着极大的兴趣观察工作的进展。记者手里拿着表，准备报出影子最短的时刻。还要说明一点，因为赛勒斯·哈丁进行测量的这一天是4月18日，真实时间和平均时间完全一致，因此吉丁·史佩莱报出的时间就是当时华盛顿的真实时间，这样一来，计算就更加简单了。这时候，随着太阳缓慢的移动，影子逐渐缩短，等到赛勒斯·哈丁觉得影子又开始伸长时，他就问道，“现在几点？”","In fact, the moment when this shadow would reach its minimum of length would be exactly twelve o’clock, and it would be enough to watch the extremity of the shadow, so as to ascertain the instant when, alter having successively diminished, it began to lengthen.By inclining his stick to the side opposite to the sun, Cyrus Harding made the shadow longer, and consequently its modifications would be more easily ascertained.In fact, the longer the needle of a dial is, the more easily can the movement of its point be followed.The shadow of the stick was nothing but the needle of a dial.The moment had come, and Cyrus Harding knelt on the sand, and with little wooden pegs, which he stuck into the sand, he began to mark the successive diminutions of the stick’s shadow.His companions, bending over him, watched the operation with extreme interest.The reporter held his chronometer in his hand, ready to tell the hour which it marked when the shadow would be at its shortest.Moreover, as Cyrus Harding was working on the 16th of April, the day on which the true and the average time are identical, the hour given by Gideon Spilett would be the true hour then at Washington, which would simplify the calculation.Meanwhile as the sun slowly advanced, the shadow slowly diminished, and when it appeared to Cyrus Harding that it was beginning to increase, he asked, “What o’clock is it?”"
"“五点零一分。”吉丁·史佩莱立刻答道。他们现在只要计算出结果就可以了。这再简单不过了。由此可见，华盛顿和林肯岛的经度差大约是五个小时，也就是说，林肯岛正午的时候，华盛顿已经是下午五点钟了。现在太阳环绕地球，每过一度需要四分钟，那么也就是一小时移动15度。15度乘以5小时等于75度。","“One minute past five,” replied Gideon Spilett directly.They had now only to calculate the operation.Nothing could be easier.It could be seen that there existed, in round numbers, a difference of five hours between the meridian of Washington and that of Lincoln Island, that is to say, it was midday in Lincoln Island when it was already five o’clock in the evening in Washington.Now the sun, in its apparent movement round the earth, traverses one degree in four minutes, or fifteen degrees an hour.Fifteen degrees multiplied by five hours give seventy-five degrees."
"那么，既然华盛顿的经度是77度3分11秒，也就是从格林尼治子午线算起的第77度。美国人和英国人都是以格林尼治为经线的起点，那么海岛一定是位于格林尼治子午线以西77度加75度的地方，也就是西经152度。","Then, since Washington is 77deg 3’ 11” as much as to say seventy-seven degrees counted from the meridian of Greenwich which the Americans take for their starting-point for longitudes concurrently with the English—it followed that the island must be situated seventy-seven and seventy-five degrees west of the meridian of Greenwich, that is to say, on the hundred and fifty-second degree of west longitude."
"赛勒斯·哈丁向同伴们宣布了这个结果，并且也像计算纬度时那样，把观察时存在的误差也考虑在内。他相信他可以肯定林肯岛的位置在35度到37度之间，经度则在格林尼治子午线以西150到155度之间。","Cyrus Harding announced this result to his companions, and taking into consideration errors of observation, as he had done for the latitude, he believed he could positively affirm that the position of Lincoln Island was between the thirty-fifth and the thirty-seventh parallel, and between the hundred and fiftieth and the hundred and fifty-fifth meridian to the west of the meridian of Greenwich."
"可以看出，他在观察过程中可能发生的误差为上下5度左右，一度合60英里，这样算来，经纬各五度的误差就相当于偏离精确位置三百英里。","The possible fault which he attributed to errors in the observation was, it may be seen, of five degrees on both sides, which, at sixty miles to a degree, would give an error of three hundred miles in latitude and longitude for the exact position."
"但这个误差并不会对他们必须做出的判断产生影响。很明显，林肯岛离任何一个国家和岛屿都有相当远的距离，因此，试图乘坐一只不结实的小船离岛太危险了。","But this error would not influence the determination which it was necessary to take.It was very evident that Lincoln Island was at such a distance from every country or island that it would be too hazardous to attempt to reach one in a frail boat."
"实际上，根据推算出的结果，海岛离塔西提岛和帕摩图群岛至少有1200英里，离新西兰有1800多英里，距美国西海岸4500英里以上！","In fact, this calculation placed it at least twelve hundred miles from Tahiti and the islands of the archipelago of the Pomoutous, more than eighteen hundred miles from New Zealand, and more than four thousand five hundred miles from the American coast!"
"赛勒斯·哈丁回忆了一下，他无论如何也想不起在太平洋的这个部分，有什么岛屿靠近林肯岛。","And when Cyrus Harding consulted his memory, he could not remember in any way that such an island occupied, in that part of the Pacific, the situation assigned to Lincoln Island."
"第十五章","Chapter 15"
"第二天是4月17日，水手的第一句话是对吉丁·史佩莱说的。","The next day, the 17th of April, the sailor’s first words were addressed to Gideon Spilett."
"“先生，”他问道，“我们今天干什么呢？”","“Well, sir,” he asked, “what shall we do to-day?”"
"“上尉高兴干的事。”记者答道。","“What the captain pleases,” replied the reporter."
"在那以前，工程师的同伴们已经当过制砖工人和制陶匠了，现在他们要变成冶金匠了。","Till then the engineer’s companions had been brickmakers and potters, now they were to become metallurgists."
"前一天早饭过后，他们行至离“石窟”七英里的颚骨角。连绵的沙丘到了尽头，那里的土壤看上去好像是火山土。那里没有像眺望岗那样的峭壁，只有奇形怪状的海湾边缘，环绕着两个海角中间的狭长海湾，边缘由火山喷发出来的矿物质构成。到了这里之后，居民们开始往回走，夜色降临时回到了“石窟”。但是一想到能否离开林肯岛的问题还没有定论，他们就没有睡下。","The day before, after breakfast, they had explored as far as the point of Mandible Cape, seven miles distant from the Chimneys.There, the long series of downs ended, and the soil had a volcanic appearance.There were no longer high cliffs as at Prospect Heights, but a strange and capricious border which surrounded the narrow gulf between the two capes, formed of mineral matter, thrown up by the volcano.Arrived at this point the settlers retraced their steps, and at nightfall entered the Chimneys; but they did not sleep before the question of knowing whether they could think of leaving Lincoln Island or not was definitely settled."
"海岛距离帕摩图群岛有1200英里，是一段相当长的距离。小船是无法横渡的，尤其是寒冷的季节快到了。潘克洛夫意味深长地表明了这一点。即便是有必要的工具，造一艘简易的船也是一项艰巨的任务，何况开拓者们没有任何工具，他们必须先着手做锤子、斧子、锛子、锯、钻子、刨等等，这要一段时间才能完成。于是大家决定在林肯岛上过冬，他们还要找一个比“石窟”更舒服的住所，好度过冬天的几个月。","The twelve hundred miles which separated the island from the Pomoutous Island was a considerable distance.A boat could not cross it, especially at the approach of the bad season.Pencroft had expressly declared this.Now, to construct a simple boat even with the necessary tools, was a difficult work, and the colonists not having tools they must begin by making hammers, axes, adzes, saws, augers, planes, etc., which would take some time.It was decided, therefore, that they would winter at Lincoln Island, and that they would look for a more comfortable dwelling than the Chimneys, in which to pass the winter months."
"在做其他事情前，首先必须找到铁矿，工程师曾在海岛的西北部发现铁矿的痕迹，那里的矿石很适于炼钢或炼铁。","Before anything else could be done it was necessary to make the iron ore, of which the engineer had observed some traces in the northwest part of the island, fit for use by converting it either into iron or into steel."
"通常情况下，金属埋藏在地下，质地并不纯。它们大多会和氧气或硫化物结合在一起。赛勒斯·哈丁上次带回的两种矿物就出现了这种情况，一种是未被碳化的磁铁矿，另一种是黄铁矿，也叫硫化铁。因此，他们必须先用炭还原氧化铁，也就是除去氧，得到纯粹的铁。这个还原过程是用炭把矿石烧到很高的温度，可以用快速而又简便的加泰罗尼亚方法，这种方法的优点在于只要一道工序就能把铁矿石炼成铁；另外也可以用鼓风炉，首先熔化铁矿石，然后除掉混在铁矿石中的百分之三到四的炭，使它变成铁。","Metals are not generally found in the ground in a pure state.For the most part they are combined with oxygen or sulphur.Such was the case with the two specimens which Cyrus Harding had brought back, one of magnetic iron, not carbonated, the other a pyrite, also called sulphuret of iron.It was, therefore the first, the oxide of iron, which they must reduce with coal, that is to say, get rid of the oxygen, to obtain it in a pure state.This reduction is made by subjecting the ore with coal to a high temperature, either by the rapid and easy Catalan method, which has the advantage of transforming the ore into iron in a single operation, or by the blast furnace, which first smelts the ore, then changes it into iron, by carrying away the three to four per cent. of coal, which is combined with it."
"现在赛勒斯·哈丁需要铁，而且他希望能尽快获取。他捡到的铁矿石本身质地很纯正，含铁量高。这是一种氧化铁，捡来时是混杂的深灰色大块，里面还有一种规则正八面结晶体形成的黑色碎末。天然磁石里就含有这种矿石，质量上乘的铁产自欧洲，瑞典和挪威大量出产此种矿石。离这个矿脉不远就是煤层，居民们已经使用这里的煤了。炼铁的原料都在周围，这样极大地方便了炼铁工作。这就是英国矿藏财富的原因，这里的煤方便了冶炼金属的工作，地下同时可以开采煤和金属进行冶炼。","Now Cyrus Harding wanted iron, and he wished to obtain it as soon as possible.The ore which he had picked up was in itself very pure and rich.It was the oxydulous iron, which is found in confused masses of a deep gray color; it gives a black dust, crystallized in the form of the regular octahedron.Native lodestones consist of this ore, and iron of the first quality is made in Europe from that with which Sweden and Norway are so abundantly supplied.Not far from this vein was the vein of coal already made use of by the settlers.The ingredients for the manufacture being close together would greatly facilitate the treatment of the ore.This is the cause of the wealth of the mines in Great Britain, where the coal aids the manufacture of the metal extracted from the same soil at the same time as itself."
"“那么，上尉，”潘克洛夫说，“我们要炼铁矿石吗？”","“Then, captain,” said Pencroft, “we are going to work iron ore?”"
"“是的，朋友们，”工程师答道，“为了这个，我们先要做件你很喜欢的事，我们必须去小岛上打海豹，作为工作的开始。”","“Yes, my friend,” replied the engineer, “and for that—something which will please you—we must begin by having a seal hunt on the islet.”"
"“打海豹！”水手把脸转向史佩莱问道，“炼铁需要海豹吗？”","“A seal hunt!” cried the sailor, turning towards Gideon Spilett.“Are seals needed to make iron?”"
"“既然赛勒斯说需要那就需要。”记者答道。","“Since Cyrus has said so!” replied the reporter."
"工程师已经走出了“石窟”，其他人也没给出解释，所以潘克洛夫开始准备打海豹。","But the engineer had already left the Chimneys, and Pencroft prepared for the seal hunt, without having received any other explanation."
"赛勒斯·哈丁、赫伯特、吉丁·史佩莱、纳布和水手很快就在海岸的一处集合，这里是海湾退潮时的水道形成的可通行浅滩。猎人们可以涉水通过，水深不到膝盖。","Cyrus Harding, Herbert, Gideon Spilett, Neb, and the sailor were soon collected on the shore, at a place where the channel left a ford passable at low tide.The hunters could therefore traverse it without getting wet higher than the knee."
"哈丁还是第一次登陆这个小岛，他的同伴们已经是第二次了。","Harding then put his foot on the islet for the first, and his companions for the second time."
"他们上岸时，成百只企鹅看着他们，一点也不害怕。猎人们手里拿着棍子，本可以轻易地打死几只，但是他们不想无端屠戮，因为要紧的是不惊动海豹，此时那些海豹正躺在几锚链远以外的沙滩上。他们也没有侵犯一种样子很天真的鸟，鸟的翅膀退化成短肢，像鳍似的展开，被像鳞片一样的羽毛装饰着。居民们谨慎地向北面前行，地面上满是小洞，形成了海鸟的窝。小岛的尽头出现了黑色的大脑袋，浮在水面上，极像移动的岩石。","On their landing some hundreds of penguins looked fearlessly at them.The hunters, armed with sticks, could have killed them easily, but they were not guilty of such useless massacre, as it was important not to frighten the seals, who were lying on the sand several cable lengths off.They also respected certain innocent-looking birds, whose wings were reduced to the state of stumps, spread out like fins, ornamented with feathers of a scaly appearance.The settlers, therefore, prudently advanced towards the north point, walking over ground riddled with little holes, which formed nests for the sea-birds.Towards the extremity of the islet appeared great black heads floating just above the water, having exactly the appearance of rocks in motion."
"这就是他们想要抓的海豹。然而，必须先等它们上岸，因为海豹的毛短而密实，躯体呈梭状，它们是出色的游泳健将，在海里捕捉它们很困难。但在陆地上，它们短小的蹼足使其只能摇摇摆摆地缓慢走动。","These were the seals which were to be captured.It was necessary, however, first to allow them to land, for with their close, short hair, and their fusiform conformation, being excellent swimmers, it is difficult to catch them in the sea, while on land their short, webbed feet prevent their having more than a slow, waddling movement."
"潘克洛夫知道这种动物的习性，他叫大家等到海豹在沙滩上伸展开来，不久太阳就会使它们进入睡眠。那时必须截断它们的退路，敲打它们的头部。","Pencroft knew the habits of these creatures, and he advised waiting till they were stretched on the sand, when the sun, before long, would send them to sleep.They must then manage to cut off their retreat and knock them on the head."
"猎手们藏在岩石后面，安静地等待着。","The hunters, having concealed themselves behind the rocks, waited silently."
"一个钟头之后，海豹开始到沙滩上玩耍。他们数了数，有六只。于是，潘克洛夫和赫伯特绕过小岛的海角，以便从它们的后面进攻，截断其退路。在此期间，赛勒斯·哈丁、史佩莱和纳布从石头后面爬出来，滑行到即将开始的战斗现场。","An hour passed before the seals came to play on the sand.They could count half a dozen.Pencroft and Herbert then went round the point of the islet, so as to take them in the rear, and cut off their retreat.During this time Cyrus Harding, Spilett, and Neb, crawling behind the rocks, glided towards the future scene of combat."
"突然间，水手的高大身躯出现了。潘克洛夫大吼一声。工程师和他的同伴们快速冲向大海和海豹之间的地带。很快就有两只海豹死在沙滩上了，剩下的几只却平安地重回大海。","All at once the tall figure of the sailor appeared.Pencroft shouted.The engineer and his two companions threw themselves between the sea and the seals.Two of the animals soon lay dead on the sand, but the rest regained the sea in safety."
"“这是我们需要的海豹，上尉。”水手边说边向工程师走去。","“Here are the seals required, captain!” said the sailor, advancing towards the engineer."
"“好极了，”哈丁应道，“我们要拿它们做风箱！”","“Capital,” replied Harding.“We will make bellows of them!”"
"“风箱！”潘克洛夫喊道，“好吧，这些海豹运气不错啊！”","“Bellows!” cried Pencroft.“Well! these are lucky seals!”"
"事实上，工程师是想用这种两栖动物的皮来做炼铁时必需的鼓风机。两只海豹大小中等，身长不到六英尺。它们的头部和狗头很像。","It was, in fact, a blowing-machine, necessary for the treatment of the ore that the engineer wished to manufacture with the skins of the amphibious creatures.They were of a medium size, for their length did not exceed six feet.They resembled a dog about the head."
"由于没有必要把这两只海豹抬回去，纳布和潘克洛夫决定就地剥皮，赛勒斯·哈丁和记者则继续探寻小岛。","As it was useless to burden themselves with the weight of both the animals, Neb and Pencroft resolved to skin them on the spot, while Cyrus Harding and the reporter continued to explore the islet."
"水手和黑人剥得很巧妙，三个小时以后，赛勒斯·哈丁就可以处置两张海豹皮，他打算不晾晒，直接利用。","The sailor and the Negro cleverly performed the operation, and three hours afterwards Cyrus Harding had at his disposal two seals’ skins, which he intended to use in this state, without subjecting them to any tanning process."
"居民一直等到再次退潮，才涉过海峡，回到“石窟”。","The settlers waited till the tide was again low, and crossing the channel they entered the Chimneys."
"然后他们就把海豹皮搭在木架上，用纤维缝制，将空气保留其中，尽量使其不漏太多。赛勒斯·哈丁只有用托普的项圈做成的两片钢刀，但是他很聪明，他的同伴们也贡献了许多智慧，三天以后，开拓小队的工具库里又增添了一件鼓风机，是在加热矿石时送风用的，这是成功完成冶炼的一个不可或缺的条件。","The skins had then to be stretched on a frame of wood and sewn by means of fibers so as to preserve the air without allowing too much to escape.Cyrus Harding had nothing but the two steel blades from Top’s collar, and yet he was so clever, and his companions aided him with so much intelligence, that three days afterwards the little colony’s stock of tools was augmented by a blowing-machine, destined to inject the air into the midst of the ore when it should be subjected to heat—an indispensable condition to the success of the operation."
"4月22日清晨，“金属时代”开始了，正如记者在笔记本里写的。如前所述，工程师已经决定在邻近煤矿和铁矿的地方开工。现在，根据他的观察，矿脉在富兰克林山东北支脉的山脚，也就是距离他们的家六英里的地方。因此，每日回到“石窟”是不可能的，于是开拓小队决定用树枝打一个棚子宿营，这样就可以夜以继日地从事这个重要的工作了。","On the morning of the 20th of April began the “metallic period,” as the reporter called it in his notes.The engineer had decided, as has been said, to operate near the veins both of coal and ore.Now, according to his observations, these veins were situated at the foot of the northeast spurs of Mount Franklin, that is to say, a distance of six miles from their home.It was impossible, therefore, to return every day to the Chimneys, and it was agreed that the little colony should camp under a hut of branches, so that the important operation could be followed night and day."
"决定了这个问题之后，他们清晨就出发了。纳布和潘克洛夫拖着装风箱的筐子，筐里还装了大量的蔬菜和肉，他们还可以在途中添些新的食物。","This settled, they set out in the morning.Neb and Pencroft dragged the bellows on a hurdle; also a quantity of vegetables and animals, which they besides could renew on the way."
"途中要穿过啄木鸟林，他们从东南方向斜穿进去，经过树木最茂密的地方，从西北方向出去。很有必要开一条路，将来这条道路可以直接打通眺望岗和富兰克林山之间的路程。森林中有许多美丽的植物，都是已经发现的品种。赫伯特发现了一些新品种，其中有种植物被潘克洛夫称作“假韭菜”。它们虽然比韭菜大，但也像洋葱、细香葱、青葱和芦笋一样，属于百合科。这些植物长有木质的根，做成菜很好吃，而且经过发酵以后，还能制成一种非常可口的酒。因此他们收藏了很多这种植物的根。","The road led through Jacamar Wood, which they traversed obliquely from southeast to northwest, and in the thickest part.It was necessary to beat a path, which would in the future form the most direct road to Prospect Heights and Mount Franklin.The trees, belonging to the species already discovered, were magnificent.Herbert found some new ones, among others some which Pencroft called “sham leeks”; for, in spite of their size, they were of the same liliaceous family as the onion, chive, shallot, or asparagus.These trees produce ligneous roots which, when cooked, are excellent; from them, by fermentation, a very agreeable liquor is made.They therefore made a good store of the roots."
"斜穿森林的路程很漫长，持续了一整天，这样他们有了大量的时间来观察林中的动物和植物。托普专门寻找动物，它穿梭于草木之间，赶出各种各样的动物。赫伯特和吉丁·史佩莱用弓箭射死了两只袋鼠，以及一只既很像刺猬又很像食蚁兽的动物。说它像刺猬，是因为它可以蜷成一个球，满身刺针竖立；说它像食蚁兽，是因为它长着锋利的爪子，又细又长的嘴，末端很像鸟喙。它还有一根可伸长的舌头，上面布满小刺，可以捕食昆虫。","The journey through the wood was long; it lasted the whole day, and so allowed plenty of time for examining the flora and fauna.Top, who took special charge of the fauna, ran through the grass and brushwood, putting up all sorts of game.Herbert and Gideon Spilett killed two kangaroos with bows and arrows, and also an animal which strongly resembled both a hedgehog and an ant-eater.It was like the first because it rolled itself into a ball, and bristled with spines, and the second because it had sharp claws, a long slender snout which terminated in a bird’s beak, and an extendible tongue, covered with little thorns which served to hold the insects."
"“等它成为盘中餐时，”潘克洛夫照例问道，“它像什么呢？”","“And when it is in the pot,” asked Pencroft naturally, “what will it be like?”"
"“上等的牛肉。”赫伯特答道。","“An excellent piece of beef,” replied Herbert."
"“我们也不能对它奢求过多。”水手说。","“We will not ask more from it,” replied the sailor,"
"在这次旅途中，他们看见几次野猪，但是这些野猪并没有攻击小队，这样看来,他们似乎不会遇见什么危险的猛兽了。可就在这时，记者感觉自己看到几步以外的的浓密树丛里，有一只他认为是熊的野兽在一棵树的矮枝间，他开始很镇定地把它画下来。吉丁·史佩莱是幸运的，他正思索的这只动物并不属于可怕的踟行类。这只是一只无尾熊，一般称为“懒兽”，体型和大狗差不多，身上的毛又硬又脏，脚上生着有力的爪子，能够攀爬树木，以树叶为食。他们看清这个动物之后，并没有去打扰它。吉丁·史佩莱把素描的标题“熊”擦掉，写上了“考拉”，然后大家继续赶路。","During this excursion they saw several wild boars, which however, did not offer to attack the little band, and it appeared as if they would not meet with any dangerous beasts; when, in a thick part of the wood, the reporter thought he saw, some paces from him, among the lower branches of a tree, an animal which he took for a bear, and which he very tranquilly began to draw.Happily for Gideon Spilett, the animal in question did not belong to the redoubtable family of the plantigrades.It was only a koala, better known under the name of the sloth, being about the size of a large dog, and having stiff hair of a dirty color, the paws armed with strong claws, which enabled it to climb trees and feed on the leaves.Having identified the animal, which they did not disturb, Gideon Spilett erased “bear” from the title of his sketch, putting koala in its place, and the journey was resumed."
"下午五点钟，赛勒斯·哈丁下令停下来。现在他们已经走出了森林，来到了支撑起富兰克林山西部走向的众多支脉下。几百英尺以外的地方有红河在流动，因此他们可以就近得到大量的淡水。","At five o’clock in the evening, Cyrus Harding gave the signal to halt.They were now outside the forest, at the beginning of the powerful spurs which supported Mount Franklin towards the west.At a distance of some hundred feet flowed the Red Creek, and consequently plenty of fresh water was within their reach."
"宿营地很快搭建起来了。不到一个小时，他们就在森林边缘的树木之间，将爬藤和树枝编在一起，再涂些粘土，搭成了一个棚子，建成了一个还算不错的住处。他们的地质勘探工作推迟到明天进行。大家开始准备晚饭，棚子前面生着熊熊燃烧的篝火，烤肉在火上转动。八点的时候，居民们留下一个人照看篝火，以防野兽潜伏在宿营地附近，其他的人已经沉沉入睡。","The camp was soon organized.In less than an hour, on the edge of the forest, among the trees, a hut of branches interlaced with creepers, and pasted over with clay, offered a tolerable shelter.Their geological researches were put off till the next day.Supper was prepared, a good fire blazed before the hut, the roast turned, and at eight o’clock, while one of the settlers watched to keep up the fire, in case any wild beasts should prowl in the neighborhood, the others slept soundly."
"第二天是4月21日，赛勒斯·哈丁带着赫伯特去寻找古老的地层，上次他已经在这种地层里发现过铁矿石的样本。他们在红河源头的地面附近发现了一处矿脉，就在一个东北支脉的山脚下。这种矿石含有丰富的铁，被易于熔化的脉石包裹着，非常适于工程师打算采用的还原炼铁法，也就是加泰罗尼亚人用的方法，只不过像科西嘉人那样简化了。实际上，所谓的加泰罗尼亚方法需要砌个熔炉，建几个坩埚，将矿石和煤分层放好，让它变化和还原。但是赛勒斯·哈丁打算省掉这些设备，只想简单地把矿石和煤做成立方体，然后用风箱把空气吹入立方体的中心。毫无疑问，这是土八该隐和世界上第一批冶金学家所用的方法。既然亚当的子孙能够成功，而且在铁矿和燃料富足的国家都取得了好效果，那么林肯岛上的居民们也一定会成功的。","The next day, the 21st of April, Cyrus Harding accompanied by Herbert, went to look for the soil of ancient formation, on which he had already discovered a specimen of ore.They found the vein above ground, near the source of the creek, at the foot of one of the northeastern spurs.This ore, very rich in iron, enclosed in its fusible veinstone, was perfectly suited to the mode of reduction which the engineer intended to employ; that is, the Catalan method, but simplified, as it is used in Corsica.In fact, the Catalan method, properly so called, requires the construction of kilns and crucibles, in which the ore and the coal, placed in alternate layers, are transformed and reduced, But Cyrus Harding intended to economize these constructions, and wished simply to form, with the ore and the coal, a cubic mass, to the center of which he would direct the wind from his bellows.Doubtless, it was the proceeding employed by Tubalcain, and the first metallurgists of the inhabited world.Now that which had succeeded with the grandson of Adam, and which still yielded good results in countries which in ore and fuel, could not but succeed with the settlers in Lincoln Island."
"煤和铁矿石可以轻易地在地上收集。他们先把铁矿石敲成小块，然后用手擦净弄脏它们表面的杂质。煤和铁矿石被一层层地堆起来，就像木炭工人烧他希望被碳化的柴那样。用这种方法，在鼓风机吹入的空气的影响下，煤就会转变成碳酸，然后变成氧化碳，它的作用就是还原氧化铁，也就是释放出氧气。","The coal, as well as the ore, was collected without trouble on the surface of the ground.They first broke the ore into little pieces, and cleansed them with the hand from the impurities which soiled their surface.Then coal and ore were arranged in heaps and in successive layers, as the charcoal-burner does with the wood which he wishes to carbonize.In this way, under the influence of the air projected by the blowing-machine, the coal would be transformed into carbonic acid, then into oxide of carbon, its use being to reduce the oxide of iron, that is to say, to rid it of the oxygen."
"工程师就是这样进行的。海豹皮风箱的一端装了一根粘土做的管口，这是事先在陶器窑里制造的，然后把风箱安装在矿石堆附近。这个鼓风机是由一个木架、植物纤维绳索和一个秤锤做成的，工程师利用这个装置，把大量的空气吹到立方体里去，温度提高以后，化学反应也同时进行，到一定的时候就能冶炼出纯铁来。","Thus the engineer proceeded.The bellows of sealskin, furnished at its extremity with a nozzle of clay, which had been previously fabricated in the pottery kiln, was established near the heap of ore.Using the mechanism which consisted of a frame, cords of fiber and counterpoise, he threw into the mass an abundance of air, which by raising the temperature also concurred with the chemical transformation to produce in time pure iron."
"这项工程很艰巨。这需要居民们全部的耐心和智慧。最后，他们终于取得了成功，成果就是一块生铁，但和海绵质地差不多，还需加以煅烧和锤炼，也就是说，必须经过打铁的过程，排除掉液化的脉石。当然，这些业余的铁匠们没有锤子，但他们的情况不比第一批冶金学家更差，因此，他们无疑只要尽力去做就好。","The operation was difficult.All the patience, all the ingenuity of the settlers was needed; but at last it succeeded, and the result was a lump of iron, reduced to a spongy state, which it was necessary to shingle and fagot, that is to say, to forge so as to expel from it the liquefied veinstone.These amateur smiths had, of course, no hammer; but they were in no worse a situation than the first metallurgist, and therefore did what, no doubt, he had to do."
"他们给第一块生铁安装了一个把手，当锤子用，来打造花岗石砧子上的第二块铁，这样他们就打出了粗糙但很实用的铁。最终经过无数次的艰苦实验，他们终于在4月25日打出了几根铁条，并把这些铁条做成了工具，如铁橇、钳子、鹤嘴锄和铲子等等。潘克洛夫和纳布说他们是真正的珍宝。但是金属还没达到最适于使用的状态，也就是还没有变成钢。钢是铁和炭的化合物，要炼钢就要从液态铁矿石里去掉多余的炭，或是向铁里加入所缺少的炭。第一种得到钢的方法，是把金属脱碳，可以产生天然钢或是铸钢；第二种方法，是把铁碳化，可以制成经渗碳处理的钢。","A handle was fixed to the first lump, and was used as a hammer to forge the second on a granite anvil, and thus they obtained a coarse but useful metal.At length, after many trials and much fatigue, on the 25th of April several bars of iron were forged, and transformed into tools, crowbars, pincers, pickaxes, spades, etc., which Pencroft and Neb declared to be real jewels.But the metal was not yet in its most serviceable state, that is, of steel.Now steel is a combination of iron and coal, which is extracted, either from the liquid ore, by taking from it the excess of coal, or from the iron by adding to it the coal which was wanting.The first, obtained by the decarburation of the metal, gives natural or puddled steel; the second, produced by the carburation of the iron, gives steel of cementation."
"赛勒斯·哈丁打算采用后一种方法炼制，因为他有质地纯正的铁。他把铁和炭粉放在坩埚里加热，坩埚是事先用粘土做的，很适合应用于此处，结果他成功了。","It was the last which Cyrus Harding intended to forge, as he possessed iron in a pure state.He succeeded by heating the metal with powdered coal in a crucible which had previously been manufactured from clay suitable for the purpose."
"于是，他用锤子对钢进行加工，这种钢在冷热条件下有延展性。纳布和潘克洛夫在工程师的精心指导下，把钢烧红，然后突然浸到冷水里，就制成了许多韧度很好的斧头。","He then worked this steel, which is malleable both when hot or cold, with the hammer.Neb and Pencroft, cleverly directed, made hatchets, which, heated red-hot, and plunged suddenly into cold water, acquired an excellent temper."
"其他工具也制造了出来，形状自然粗糙。其中有做刨刀、砍柴斧、手斧用的钢板，做锯和凿子用的钢块，此外还有制造铲子、鹤嘴锄、钉子等用的铁。5月7日那天，金属时期终于结束了。铁匠们回到了“石窟”，很快就有新的工作授予他们新的头衔了。","Other instruments, of course roughly fashioned, were also manufactured; blades for planes, axes, hatchets, pieces of steel to be transformed into saws, chisels; then iron for spades, pickaxes, hammers, nails, etc.At last, on the 5th of May, the metallic period ended, the smiths returned to the Chimneys, and new work would soon authorize them to take a fresh title."
"第十六章","Chapter 16"
"那天是5月6号，相当于北半球的11月6号。天阴沉着有好几天了，现在为过冬做准备就很重要了。不过气温还不太低，如果现在把一支摄氏温度计运到林肯岛，显示的平均气温应该还会在零上十到十二度。这并不奇怪，因为林肯岛可能处于南纬35到40度之间，与北半球的西西里和希腊的气候应该很相似。但是希腊和西西里的冬季气候恶劣，冰雪交加，所以林肯岛到冬天也会有这种最恶劣的天气，准备御寒无疑是明智之举。","It was the 6th of May, a day which corresponds to the 6th of November in the countries of the Northern Hemisphere.The sky had been obscured for some days, and it was of importance to make preparations for the winter.However, the temperature was not as yet much lower, and a centigrade thermometer, transported to Lincoln Island, would still have marked an average of ten to twelve degrees above zero.This was not surprising, since Lincoln Island, probably situated between the thirty-fifth and fortieth parallel, would be subject, in the Southern Hemisphere, to the same climate as Sicily or Greece in the Northern Hemisphere.But as Greece and Sicily have severe cold, producing snow and ice, so doubtless would Lincoln Island in the severest part of the winter and it was advisable to provide against it."
"无论如何，即使他们还没受到严寒的威胁，雨季也将要到来了，这座汪洋中的孤岛肯定会遭遇狂暴的恶劣天气，坏天气会很频繁，还可能很可怕。因此，当务之急是慎重考虑，谨慎选择一个比“石窟”更舒适的住所，而且要尽快行动。","In any case if cold did not yet threaten them, the rainy season would begin, and on this lonely island, exposed to all the fury of the elements, in mid-ocean, bad weather would be frequent, and probably terrible.The question of a more comfortable dwelling than the Chimneys must therefore be seriously considered and promptly resolved on."
"潘克洛夫自然偏爱自己找到的住处，但是他很明白必须再找一处安身之所。“石窟”已经被海水冲刷过一次了，当时的情况大家都很清楚，如果再发生类似事件，后果就不堪设想了。","Pencroft, naturally, had some predilection for the retreat which he had discovered, but he well understood that another must be found.The Chimneys had been already visited by the sea, under circumstances which are known, and it would not do to be exposed again to a similar accident."
"“除此以外，”赛勒斯·哈丁当天和同伴们谈到这些问题的时候说：“我们还要做好防范措施。”","“Besides,” added Cyrus Harding, who this day was talking of these things with his companions, “we have some precautions to take.”"
"“为什么？”岛上又没有人。”记者说道。","“Why?The island is not inhabited,” said the reporter."
"“这有可能，”工程师回答道，“尽管我们还没有探索过内陆区域，但是，如果没有人，我担心会有很多危险的野兽。我们有必要防范可能遭受的袭击，这样我们就不需要每晚守夜或是看火了。另外，朋友们，我们必须预见任何可能发生的事情。我们所在的地方正是太平洋上马来海盗经常出没的地方。”","“That is probable,” replied the engineer, “although we have not yet explored the interior; but if no human beings are found, I fear that dangerous animals may abound.It is necessary to guard against a possible attack, so that we shall not be obliged to watch every night, or to keep up a fire.And then, my friends, we must foresee everything.We are here in a part of the Pacific often frequented by Malay pirates—”"
"“什么？”赫伯特说，“来到离陆地这么远的地方？”","“What!” said Herbert, “at such a distance from land?”"
"“是的，孩子，”工程师回答道,“这些海盗是勇敢的水手，同时也是可怕的敌人，我们必须采取相应的措施。”","“Yes, my boy,” replied the engineer.“These pirates are bold sailors as well as formidable enemies, and we must take measures accordingly.”"
"“好，”潘克洛夫回答道，“不管是两条腿的野人还是四条腿的野兽，我们都加强防备。可是，上尉，等我们把海岛彻底勘察一遍再行动不是最好吗？”","“Well,” replied Pencroft, “we will fortify ourselves against savages with two legs as well as against savages with four.But, captain, will it not be best to explore every part of the island before undertaking anything else?”"
"“那样最好。”吉丁·史佩莱补充道。","“That would be best,” added Gideon Spilett."
"“我们已经在这里找洞穴，却无果而终，真不知道对面能不能找到一个洞穴。”","“Who knows if we might not find on the opposite side one of the caverns which we have searched for in vain here?”"
"“对，”工程师答道，“但是朋友们，你们忘了，我们有必要在河道周围选址，从富兰克林山顶往西看，既没有小溪也没有河流。相反地，我们现在的住处位于慈恩河与格兰特河之间，这个优越性是不容忽略的。另外，这儿面向东方，不像另一面正迎着从这个半球西北方吹来的信风。","“That is true,” replied the engineer, “but you forget, my friends, that it will be necessary to establish ourselves in the neighborhood of a watercourse, and that, from the summit of Mount Franklin, we could not see towards the west, either stream or river.Here, on the contrary, we are placed between the Mercy and Lake Grant, an advantage which must not be neglected.And, besides, this side, looking towards the east, is not exposed as the other is to the trade-winds, which in this hemisphere blow from the northwest.”"
"“那么，上尉，”水手答道，“让我们在湖边上建一座房子吧。现在砖头和工具都不缺。我们已经做过烧砖工、陶工、冶炼工和铁匠了，我们一定知道怎么做泥瓦匠！”","“Then, captain,” replied the sailor, “let us build a house on the edge of the lake.Neither bricks nor tools are wanting now.After having been brickmakers, potters, smelters, and smiths, we shall surely know how to be masons!”"
"“是的，朋友，但是在做任何决定之前，我们必须全面考虑这个问题。一个天然的住处能省掉我们很多人力，还会是更可靠的退路，因为它不但能防备岛内敌人的袭击，也能抵御外来敌人。","“Yes, my friend; but before coming to any decision we must consider the matter thoroughly.A natural dwelling would spare us much work, and would be a surer retreat, for it would be as well defended against enemies from the interior as those from outside.”"
"“对，赛勒斯，”记者回应道，“可是整个花岗石壁我们都检查过了，连一个窟窿、一条裂缝都没有！”","“That is true, Cyrus,” replied the reporter, “but we have already examined all that mass of granite, and there is not a hole, not a cranny!”"
"“没有，一个也没有！”潘克洛夫补充道，“如果我们能在峭壁上选择适当的高度，掘一个住处，远离危险，那就再好不过了！住处面朝大海，有五六间房。”","“No, not one!” added Pencroft.“Ah, if we were able to dig out a dwelling in that cliff, at a good height, so as to be out of the reach of harm, that would be capital!I can see that on the front which looks seaward, five or six rooms—”"
"“还有窗子透光！”赫伯特笑着说。","“With windows to light them!” said Herbert, laughing."
"“还有梯子可以爬上去！”纳布补充道。","“And a staircase to climb up to them!” added Neb."
"“你在笑，”水手大声说，“为什么？难道我的提议就办不到吗？我们不是已经有鹤嘴锄和铲子吗？哈丁上尉不是会制造火药来炸矿吗？哈丁上尉，只要我们需要火药，你就会做出来，不是吗？”","“You are laughing,” cried the sailor, “and why?What is there impossible in what I propose?Haven’t we got pickaxes and spades?Won’t Captain Harding be able to make powder to blow up the mine?Isn’t it true, captain, that you will make powder the very day we want it?”"
"赛勒斯·哈丁听着激情四溢的潘克洛夫讲他的奇思妙想。这么一大块花岗岩壁，即使用地雷都是巨大的工程。大自然无法在他们需要的时候提供帮助，这真令人烦恼。工程师没有回答水手的问题，而是建议更细致地检查从河口到北面峭壁尽头的拐角处一带。","Cyrus Harding listened to the enthusiastic Pencroft developing his fanciful projects.To attack this mass of granite, even by a mine, was Herculean work, and it was really vexing that nature could not help them at their need.But the engineer did not reply to the sailor except by proposing to examine the cliff more attentively, from the mouth of the river to the angle which terminated it on the north."
"于是大家都出发了，在将近两英里的范围内作了一次极为细致的检查。但是在光秃秃、直立的峭壁上，找不到任何洞穴。野鸽在山顶上拍动着双翼，它们的巢实际上就是在峰顶上、参差不齐的花岗岩壁边缘挖的孔。","They went out, therefore, and the exploration was made with extreme care, over an extent of nearly two miles.But in no place in the bare, straight cliff, could any cavity be found.The nests of the rock pigeons which fluttered at its summit were only, in reality, holes bored at the very top, and on the irregular edge of the granite."
"这种情况令人气恼，不管用鹤嘴锄还是炸药，打算在这个峭壁上开凿出一个够大的山洞来，都是妄想。目前的情况是，在这一带的海岸上，潘克洛夫发现了唯一的居所，也就是“石窟”，他们此时必须丢弃。　　　　　　　　","It was a provoking circumstance, and as to attacking this cliff, either with pickaxe or with powder, so as to effect a sufficient excavation, it was not to be thought of.It so happened that, on all this part of the shore, Pencroft had discovered the only habitable shelter, that is to say, the Chimneys, which now had to be abandoned."
"勘探工作结束了，拓荒者发现自己处在峭壁的北角，这里是峭壁的终点，一个长长的斜坡一直延伸到海岸。从这里直到西边的尽头，只形成了一种斜坡，由厚厚的大团石头、泥土、沙子构成，植物、灌木和草将它们连在一起，斜坡的倾斜度只有45度。斜坡上的树木是一簇一簇的，坡上覆盖着厚厚的绿草。可是过去不远，就没有植被了，而是一片长长的沙质平原，从这些斜坡脚下一直延伸到海滩。","The exploration ended, the colonists found themselves at the north angle of the cliff, where it terminated in long slopes which died away on the shore.From this place, to its extreme limit in the west, it only formed a sort of declivity, a thick mass of stones, earth, and sand, bound together by plants, bushes, and grass inclined at an angle of only forty-five degrees.Clumps of trees grew on these slopes, which were also carpeted with thick grass.But the vegetation did not extend far, and a long, sandy plain, which began at the foot of these slopes, reached to the beach."
"赛勒斯·哈丁的想法不是没有道理，他觉得溢出的湖水一定会淹没这一边。红河流过来的多余的水也必须通过一些渠道流出去。现在，工程师还没有在勘察过的海岸上发现任何水道，也就是说，从眺望岗以西的河口起还没有排水道。","Cyrus Harding thought, not without reason, that the overplus of the lake must overflow on this side.The excess of water furnished by the Red Creek must also escape by some channel or other.Now the engineer had not yet found this channel on any part of the shore already explored, that is to say, from the mouth of the stream on the west of Prospect Heights."
"工程师现在建议同伴们爬上斜坡，通过眺望岗回到“石窟”，顺便可以勘探湖的北部和东部河岸。大家都同意这个提议，几分钟时间里，赫伯特和纳布已经爬到了上面的高地。赛勒斯·哈丁、吉丁·史佩莱和潘克洛夫迈着更加稳重的脚步跟了上去。","The engineer now proposed to his companions to climb the slope, and to return to the Chimneys by the heights, while exploring the northern and eastern shores of the lake.The proposal was accepted, and in a few minutes Herbert and Neb were on the upper plateau.Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, and Pencroft followed with more sedate steps."
"在阳光的照射下，湖面闪闪发光，通过树林依稀可见。从这里望去，这片土地非常迷人。他们欣赏着这一片树林，大饱眼福。一些老树干由于年岁久远弯了下来，投下黑色的阴影，与覆盖地面的青翠绿草形成对比。一大群羽毛亮丽的美冠鹦鹉在树枝中尖叫着，像移动的棱镜，从一个大枝跳到另一个。","The beautiful sheet of water glittered through the trees under the rays of the sun.In this direction the country was charming.The eye feasted on the groups of trees.Some old trunks, bent with age, showed black against the verdant grass which covered the ground.Crowds of brilliant cockatoos screamed among the branches, moving prisms, hopping from one bough to another."
"居民们没有直接走到湖的北岸，而是沿着高地边缘转了一个圈，以便在左岸到达河口。这段距离大约有一英里半。很容易走过去，因为树木分布广阔，为他们留出了相当大的空隙。显然，肥沃茂盛的地带到这里就终止了，在红河和慈悲河之间的植被不会这么茂盛了。","The settlers instead of going directly to the north bank of the lake, made a circuit round the edge of the plateau, so as to join the mouth of the creek on its left bank.It was a detour of more than a mile and a half.Walking was easy, for the trees widely spread, left a considerable space between them.The fertile zone evidently stopped at this point, and vegetation would be less vigorous in the part between the course of the Creek and the Mercy."
"赛勒斯·哈丁和同伴们十分谨慎地在这片新土地上行走。他们的武器只有弓箭和带有锋利铁尖的棍子。然而，没有野兽出没，可能这些野兽只经常在南方茂密的丛林中出没。但是，当他们看见托普站在一条巨蛇面前的时候，还是大吃了一惊，这条大蛇有14到15英尺长。纳布用棍子一下子打死了它。赛勒斯·哈丁检查了这条蛇，告诉大家这不是毒蛇，它是钻石蛇的一种，新南威尔士的当地人饲养这种蛇。但是这里可能存在其他蛇，一咬能致人于死地，比如尾巴呈叉状的蝰蛇，它们从脚底竖起来，还有飞蛇，长着的两只耳朵使它们跑起来极快。托普吃惊过后，就急切地开始追逐起另一只爬行动物来，让大家担心起他的安全来。他的主人马上将他叫了回来。","Cyrus Harding and his companions walked over this new ground with great care.Bows, arrows, and sticks with sharp iron points were their only weapons.However, no wild beast showed itself, and it was probable that these animals frequented rather the thick forests in the south; but the settlers had the disagreeable surprise of seeing Top stop before a snake of great size, measuring from fourteen to fifteen feet in length.Neb killed it by a blow from his stick.Cyrus Harding examined the reptile, and declared it not venomous, for it belonged to that species of diamond serpents which the natives of New South Wales rear.But it was possible that others existed whose bite was mortal such as the deaf vipers with forked tails, which rise up under the feet, or those winged snakes, furnished with two ears, which enable them to proceed with great rapidity.Top, the first moment of surprise over, began a reptile chase with such eagerness, that they feared for his safety.His master called him back directly."
"他们很快到达了红河的河口，就是水流入湖中的地方。探险者们发现了对面海岸的一个点，就是他们从富兰克林山上下山时去过的。赛勒斯·哈丁确定，从红河流入湖中的水量是相当大的。因此，大自然一定要给多余的水提供一个流出的地方。这无疑会形成一个瀑布，如果能找到它，一定会十分有用。","The mouth of the Red Creek, at the place where it entered into the lake, was soon reached.The explorers recognized on the opposite shore the point which they had visited on their descent from Mount Franklin.Cyrus Harding ascertained that the flow of water into it from the creek was considerable.Nature must therefore have provided some place for the escape of the overplus.This doubtless formed a fall, which, if it could be discovered, would be of great use."
"这些拓荒者走的时候是分开的，但彼此隔得不是很远，他们开始沿着陡峭的湖边行走。水中到处都是鱼，潘克洛夫决定做一些钓鱼竿，来试着抓些鱼。","The colonists, walking apart, but not straying far from each other, began to skirt the edge of the lake, which was very steep.The water appeared to be full of fish, and Pencroft resolved to make some fishing-rods, so as to try and catch some."
"他们首先绕过东北角。据推测，湖水可能就是从这里排出去的，因为湖水的最高点几乎和高地的边缘齐平。但是他们还是没有找到排水的迹象，开拓者们继续沿岸搜索，湖岸在稍微弯曲之后，逐渐降下来，与海岸线平行了。","The northeast point was first to be doubled.It might have been supposed that the discharge of water was at this place, for the extremity of the lake was almost on a level with the edge of the plateau.But no signs of this were discovered, and the colonists continued to explore the bank, which, after a slight bend, descended parallel to the shore."
"岸这边的森林比较稀疏，只是东一簇西一簇地分布着，为小岛的景致增添了色彩。从这里可以看到格兰特湖的全景，没有任何气息打扰湖面的平静。托普用棍子敲打着灌木丛，惊起了一群群不同种类的鸟，史佩莱和赫伯特用箭瞄准它们。一只鸟被男孩射中了，倒在了沼泽的草地上。托普冲上去，拎回来一只美丽的水鸟，浑身蓝灰色，短喙，前额发达，两只翅膀有白边。这是一只黑鸭，大小和大鹧鸪差不多，属于长趾类水禽，介于涉水鸟类和蹼足类之间。但遗憾的是，这种鸟的味道实在是太不好了。但是托普在这些事情上没有主人们那么挑剔，所以大家决定把“黑鸭”留给它做晚饭。","On this side the banks were less woody, but clumps of trees, here and there, added to the picturesqueness of the country.Lake Grant was viewed from thence in all its extent, and no breath disturbed the surface of its waters.Top, in beating the bushes, put up flocks of birds of different kinds, which Gideon Spilett and Herbert saluted with arrows.One was hit by the lad, and fell into some marshy grass.Top rushed forward, and brought a beautiful swimming bird, of a slate color, short beak, very developed frontal plate, and wings edged with white.It was a “coot,” the size of a large partridge, belonging to the group of macrodactyls which form the transition between the order of wading birds and that of palmipeds.Sorry game, in truth, and its flavor is far from pleasant.But Top was not so particular in these things as his masters, and it was agreed that the coot should be for his supper."
"居民们现在正沿着湖的东岸行进，不久就要到他们已经知道的地方了。由于没有看到任何排水道的痕迹，工程师非常惊讶。记者和水手跟他交谈的时候，他再也掩饰不住自己的惊讶心情。","The settlers were now following the eastern bank of the lake, and they would not be long in reaching the part which they already knew.The engineer was much surprised at not seeing any indication of the discharge of water.The reporter and the sailor talked with him, and he could not conceal his astonishment."
"这时候，一直很安静的托普发出了惊讶的信号。这个机灵的畜生在海岸边走来走去，突然停住，看着水面，抬起一只爪子，似乎在指着什么看不见的猎物，继而又狂吠起来，马上又安静了。","At this moment Top, who had been very quiet till then, gave signs of agitation.The intelligent animal went backwards and forwards on the shore, stopped suddenly, and looked at the water, one paw raised, as if he was pointing at some invisible game; then he barked furiously, and was suddenly silent."
"一开始赛勒斯·哈丁和同伴们都没有注意托普的行为，但是狗的吠声马上变得如此频繁，以至于工程师注意到了。","Neither Cyrus Harding nor his companions had at first paid any attention to Top’s behavior; but the dog’s barking soon became so frequent that the engineer noticed it."
"“这是哪里，托普？”他问道。","“What is there, Top?” he asked."
"托普向主人跳过去，显得非常不安，然后又朝着岸边冲去。然后，它一下子跳进湖中。","The dog bounded towards his master, seeming to be very uneasy, and then rushed again towards the bank.Then, all at once, he plunged into the lake."
"“回来，托普！”赛勒斯·哈丁喊道，他不希望狗到危险的水中冒险。","“Here, Top!” cried Cyrus Harding, who did not like his dog to venture into the treacherous water."
"“那里到底发生了什么？”潘克洛夫边问边盯着湖面。","“What’s happening down there?” asked Pencroft, examining the surface of the lake."
"“托普嗅到了什么两栖动物的气味了。”赫伯特答道。","“Top smells some amphibious creature,” replied Herbert."
"“可能是一只鳄鱼。”记者说。","“An alligator, perhaps,” said the reporter."
"“我觉得不是，”哈丁回答，“鳄鱼只生活在纬度较低的地区。”","“I do not think so,” replied Harding.“Alligators are only met with in regions less elevated in latitude.”"
"与此同时，托普在主人的召唤下回来了，重新上了岸。但是它还是没法安静下来，他又跃进深草丛中，似乎在直觉的指引下追踪着某个隐形的东西，它正在水面下游动。然而，现在的湖面很平静，没有泛起一丝涟漪。居民们几次停在湖边，密切关注着湖面的情况。什么也没有出现。水中隐藏着什么秘密。","Meanwhile Top had returned at his master’s call, and had regained the shore: but he could not stay quiet; he plunged in among the tall grass, and guided by instinct, he appeared to follow some invisible being which was slipping along under the surface of the water.However the water was calm; not a ripple disturbed its surface.Several times the settlers stopped on the bank, and observed it attentively.Nothing appeared.There was some mystery there."
"工程师也很迷惑。","The engineer was puzzled."
"“让我们将勘探进行到底。”他说。","“Let us pursue this exploration to the end,” said he."
"半个小时之后，他们到达了湖东南角的眺望岗上。到这里为止，湖岸算是勘察完了，然而工程师还是没有找到湖水是怎样、从哪里外泄的。“这个出口肯定存在，”他重复道，“既然我们看不见，湖水肯定是通过西边的花岗岩岩壁流出去的！”","Half an hour after they had all arrived at the southeast angle of the lake, on Prospect Heights.At this point the examination of the banks of the lake was considered finished, and yet the engineer had not been able to discover how and where the waters were discharged.“There is no doubt this overflow exists,” he repeated, “and since it is not visible it must go through the granite cliff at the west!”"
"“但是亲爱的赛勒斯，知道这些又有什么用呢？”吉丁·史佩莱问道。","“But what importance do you attach to knowing that, my dear Cyrus?” asked Gideon Spilett."
"“太重要了，”工程师答道，“如果湖水是由崖壁排出的，那就很可能会有山洞。要是我们把山洞里的水排出，那儿就很容易成为适宜居住的地方。”","“Considerable importance,” replied the engineer; “for if it flows through the cliff there is probably some cavity, which it would be easy to render habitable after turning away the water.”"
"“可是上尉，湖水有没有可能从湖底流出？”赫伯特说，“湖水从地下通过流入大海？”","“But is it not possible, captain, that the water flows away at the bottom of the lake,” said Herbert, “and that it reaches the sea by some subterranean passage?”"
"“有这种可能，”工程师回答道，“要真是那样，就是天不助我们，我们只有自己盖房子了。”","“That might be,” replied the engineer, “and should it be so we shall be obliged to build our house ourselves, since nature has not done it for us.”"
"拓荒者们刚要穿过高地回到“石窟”，就发现托普又开始焦躁起来。它狂吠不止，还没等主人阻止，它又一次跳进湖中。","The colonists were about to begin to traverse the plateau to return to the Chimneys, when Top gave new signs of agitation.He barked with fury, and before his master could restrain him, he had plunged a second time into the lake."
"大家都跟着朝岸边奔去。狗已经游出20多英尺远，那里的水看起来并不深，赛勒斯正在喊它时，水里突然冒出一个大脑袋来。","All ran towards the bank.The dog was already more than twenty feet off, and Cyrus was calling him back, when an enormous head emerged from the water, which did not appear to be deep in that place."
"赫伯特一眼就看出这是一只两栖动物，长着尖尖的脑袋，大大的眼睛，还有柔软的长胡须。","Herbert recognized directly the species of amphibian to which the tapering head, with large eyes, and adorned with long silky mustaches, belonged."
"“海牛！”他喊道。","“A lamantin!” he cried."
"它并不是海牛，而是鲸类动物的一种，名叫“儒艮”，它的鼻孔长在鼻子的上方。这个庞然大物向托普冲去，托普试图逃回岸边。它的主人没办法救它，在史佩莱和赫伯特弯弓之前，托普就被儒艮抓住，拖到水下。","It was not a lamantin, but one of that species of the order of cetaceans, which bear the name of the “dugong,” for its nostrils were open at the upper part of its snout.The enormous animal rushed on the dog, who tried to escape by returning towards the shore.His master could do nothing to save him, and before Gideon Spilett or Herbert thought of bending their bows, Top, seized by the dugong, had disappeared beneath the water."
"纳布手中拿着带铁尖的矛，打算到那危险动物的活动区域去袭击它，帮助托普。","Neb, his iron-tipped spear in his hand, wished to go to Top’s help, and attack the dangerous animal in its own element."
"“不，纳布。”工程师说，阻止了这位勇敢的仆人。","“No, Neb,” said the engineer, restraining his courageous servant."
"在此期间，水下展开了一场搏斗，这简直是一场不可思议的搏斗，以托普现在的处境，它无法抵抗，从水面的水泡判断，这肯定是场可怕的搏斗，一定会以托普的死亡告终！但是突然间，托普从一个泡沫四溅的漩涡中冒了出来。托普被未知的力量抛到空中，离水面有十英尺，然后又落入激荡的湖水中，很快它就游到岸上，没有任何重伤，奇迹般地活了下来。","Meanwhile, a struggle was going on beneath the water, an inexplicable struggle, for in his situation Top could not possibly resist; and judging by the bubbling of the surface it must be also a terrible struggle, and could not but terminate in the death of the dog!But suddenly, in the middle of a foaming circle, Top reappeared.Thrown in the air by some unknown power, he rose ten feet above the surface of the lake, fell again into the midst of the agitated waters, and then soon gained the shore, without any severe wounds, miraculously saved."
"赛勒斯·哈丁和同伴们百思不得其解。同样令人惊异的是水下的搏斗似乎还在继续。毫无疑问，儒艮遭到了什么猛兽的进攻，因此才放了托普，进行自卫，但是，搏斗没持续多久。湖水被鲜血染红了，儒艮的尸体从四处扩散的鲜红色的湖水中浮了上来，很快就搁浅在湖南角的小沙滩上。拓荒者们朝它的尸体跑过去。儒艮已经死了。这是一只庞然大物，长达15到16英尺，至少有三千到四千磅重。它的颈上有一个伤口，好像被尖刀割过一样。","Cyrus Harding and his companions could not understand it.What was not less inexplicable was that the struggle still appeared to be going on.Doubtless, the dugong, attacked by some powerful animal, after having released the dog, was fighting on its own account.But it did not last long.The water became red with blood, and the body of the dugong, emerging from the sheet of scarlet which spread around, soon stranded on a little beach at the south angle of the lake.The colonists ran towards it.The dugong was dead.It was an enormous animal, fifteen or sixteen feet long, and must have weighed from three to four thousand pounds.At its neck was a wound, which appeared to have been produced by a sharp blade."
"究竟是什么两栖动物进行了这么可怕的攻击，把凶猛的儒艮杀死呢？谁也不知道答案，哈丁和同伴们怀着对此事的极大兴趣，回到“石窟”去了。","What could the amphibious creature have been, who, by this terrible blow had destroyed the formidable dugong?No one could tell, and much interested in this incident, Harding and his companions returned to the Chimneys."
"第十七章","Chapter 17"
"第二天是5月7号，哈丁和吉丁·史佩莱爬上了眺望岗，赫伯特和潘克洛夫则顺河而上，备些新柴火，只留下纳布在洞中准备早饭。","The next day, the 7th of May, Harding and Gideon Spilett, leaving Neb to prepare breakfast, climbed Prospect Heights, while Herbert and Pencroft ascended by the river, to renew their store of wood."
"工程师和记者很快就到达了儒艮搁浅的那块小沙滩上。鸟群已经开始啄食这个庞然大物的肉，赛勒斯想把肥肉留给大家备用，不得不用石子将鸟群赶走。这种动物的肉可以做成盛宴，在马来群岛及其他地方，儒艮的肉专门留给当地的王公贵族。不过这是纳布的事。","The engineer and the reporter soon reached the little beach on which the dugong had been stranded.Already flocks of birds had attacked the mass of flesh, and had to be driven away with stones, for Cyrus wished to keep the fat for the use of the colony.As to the animal’s flesh it would furnish excellent food, for in the islands of the Malay Archipelago and elsewhere, it is especially reserved for the table of the native princes.But that was Neb’s affair."
"这时，赛勒斯·哈丁又产生了新的念头。他对昨天的事有极大兴趣。他打算弄明白那场水下搏斗的秘密，查明究竟是什么动物能在儒艮身上留下这么奇怪的创伤。他站在湖边，仔细观察着，但是平静的湖面下什么也没有，湖面在初升太阳的第一道光照下波光粼粼。","At this moment Cyrus Harding had other thoughts.He was much interested in the incident of the day before.He wished to penetrate the mystery of that submarine combat, and to ascertain what monster could have given the dugong so strange a wound.He remained at the edge of the lake, looking, observing; but nothing appeared under the tranquil waters, which sparkled in the first rays of the rising sun."
"在儒艮搁浅的海滩，湖水很浅，但是湖底从这里往下慢慢倾斜，湖中央可能相当深。整个湖就好比一个巨大的中央盆地，由来自红河的水填满。","At the beach, on which lay the body of the dugong, the water was tolerably shallow, but from this point the bottom of the lake sloped gradually, and it was probable that the depth was considerable in the center.The lake might be considered as a large center basin, which was filled by the water from the Red Creek."
"“好了，赛勒斯，”记者说，“水底好像没有什么可疑的东西。”","“Well, Cyrus,” said the reporter, “there seems to be nothing suspicious in this water.”"
"“是的，我亲爱的史佩莱，”工程师回答道，“我的确不知道怎样解释昨天发生的事。”","“No, my dear Spilett,” replied the engineer, “and I really do not know how to account for the incident of yesterday.”"
"“我承认，”史佩莱回答道，“儒艮受的伤至少是很奇怪，我也无法解释托普是怎么从水中被猛地抛起来的。就像有一个人，用一只强有力的胳膊将他抛起，另一只胳膊拿着匕首将儒艮杀死！”","“I acknowledge,” returned Spilett, “that the wound given this creature is, at least, very strange, and I cannot explain either how Top was so vigorously cast up out of the water.One could have thought that a powerful arm hurled him up, and that the same arm with a dagger killed the dugong!”"
"“是的，”工程师沉思着回答道，“这事我有些地方不能理解。还有，亲爱的史佩莱，你能理解我是用什么方式自救的吗？我是怎么从海浪中被拖出来，又怎么被带到沙丘上的？不知道！难道这不是真的吗？现在我可以肯定，这里面一定有什么秘密，我相信，有一天我们会揭开这些秘密。我们不妨细心观察，但不必在同伴面前细谈这些奇特的事。我们先将这些话压在心头，继续我们的工作。","“Yes,” replied the engineer, who had become thoughtful; “there is something there that I cannot understand.But do you better understand either, my dear Spilett, in what way I was saved myself—how I was drawn from the waves, and carried to the downs?No!Is it not true?Now, I feel sure that there is some mystery there, which, doubtless, we shall discover some day.Let us observe, but do not dwell on these singular incidents before our companions.Let us keep our remarks to ourselves, and continue our work.”"
"大家现在还记得，工程师还没有发现多余的湖水在哪里排出，但是他知道这个地方一定存在。当在这里看见一股急流时，工程师相当惊讶。他将一些木头块扔进水流中，发现它向南边的角流去。他跟着那股急流，来到了湖的南面。","It will be remembered that the engineer had not as yet been able to discover the place where the surplus water escaped, but he knew it must exist somewhere.He was much surprised to see a strong current at this place.By throwing in some bits of wood he found that it set towards the southern angle.He followed the current, and arrived at the south point of the lake."
"水中有一块洼地，好像水一下子漏进地缝里了似的。","There was there a sort of depression in the water, as if it was suddenly lost in some fissure in the ground."
"哈丁将耳朵贴在与湖面平行的地面上，倾听着，他能清楚地听到水下瀑布的声响。","Harding listened; placing his ear to the level of the lake, he very distinctly heard the noise of a subterranean fall."
"“那里，”他边起身边说道，“那里就是排水的地方，湖水肯定是通过花岗岩壁里的通道和石洞汇入大海，我们可以利用这些石洞。看着吧，我一定能找到它！”","“There,” said he, rising, “is the discharge of the water; there, doubtless, by a passage in the granite cliff, it joins the sea, through cavities which we can use to our profit.Well, I can find it!”"
"工程师砍了一根很长的树枝，将叶子都剥了，将树枝插入两岸间的拐角处，他发现水下一英尺深处有一个大洞。这个洞就是他们一直寻找未果的排水口，这股急流的力量很大，工程师手中的树枝都被水流折断并消失了。","The engineer cut a long branch, stripped it of its leaves, and plunging it into the angle between the two banks, he found that there was a large hole one foot only beneath the surface of the water.This hole was the opening so long looked for in vain, and the force of the current was such that the branch was torn from the engineer’s hands and disappeared."
"“肯定就是这样了，”哈丁重复道，“这里就是湖水的出口，我要让它显现出来！”","“There is no doubt about it now,” repeated Harding.“There is the outlet, and I will lay it open to view!”"
"“怎么做呢？”史佩莱问道。","“How?” asked Gideon Spilett."
"“将湖面降低三英尺。”“你怎么降低湖面呢？”","“By lowering the level of the water of the lake three feet.”“And how will you lower the level?”"
"“开一个比这个更大的出口。”","“By opening another outlet larger than this.”"
"“在哪里开，赛勒斯？”","“At what place, Cyrus?”"
"“在最靠近岸边的地方。”","“At the part of the bank nearest the coast.”"
"“但是那是一大块花岗岩呀！”史佩莱说。","“But it is a mass of granite!” observed Spilett."
"“嗯，”赛勒斯·哈丁答道，“我要炸开这片花岗岩，溢出的湖水会使水位下降，从而露出洞口来——”","“Well,” replied Cyrus Harding, “I will blow up the granite, and the water escaping, will subside, so as to lay bare this opening—”"
"“我们可以炸开一个瀑布，将水倾泻在沙滩上。”记者补充道。","“And make a waterfall, by falling on to the beach,” added the reporter."
"“那我们就可以利用那个瀑布啦！”赛勒斯回答道，“来吧，来吧！”","“A fall that we shall make use of!” replied Cyrus.“Come, come!”"
"工程师催促同伴赶紧离开，记者对工程师颇有信心，他对这项工程的成功毫不怀疑。但是没有火药，也没有精制的工具，怎样才能炸开花岗岩石壁呢？工程师如此热衷的工程难道不是超出他们的能力范围吗？","The engineer hurried away his companion, whose confidence in Harding was such that he did not doubt the enterprise would succeed.And yet, how was this granite wall to be opened without powder, and with imperfect instruments?Was not this work upon which the engineer was so bent above their strength?"
"当哈丁和记者回到“石窟”中时，他们发现赫伯特和潘克洛夫正在卸木筏上的木头。","When Harding and the reporter entered the Chimneys, they found Herbert and Pencroft unloading their raft of wood."
"“樵夫的工作已经完成了，上尉，”水手边说边笑，“什么时候你需要泥瓦匠？”","“The woodmen have just finished, captain.” said the sailor, laughing, “and when you want masons—”"
"“泥瓦匠倒不用，我要的是化学家。”工程师回答道。","“Masons,—no, but chemists,” replied the engineer."
"“是的，”记者补充道，“我们打算炸海岛。”","“Yes,” added the reporter, “we are going to blow up the island—”"
"“炸海岛？”潘克洛夫喊道。","“Blow up the island?” cried Pencroft."
"“至少是炸一部分。”史佩莱答道。","“Part of it, at least,” replied Spilett."
"“听我说，朋友们。”工程师说道。他将自己的观察结果告诉了大家。","“Listen to me, my friends,” said the engineer.And he made known to them the result of his observations."
"据他描述，在花岗岩壁中肯定有一个不小的石洞，它支撑着眺望岗，他打算进入洞中。要想成功，必须首先炸开排水的通道，开出一个更大口，从而使湖面水位降低。所以，必须制造炸药，在岸的其他地方炸出一个深沟。这便是哈丁打算用大自然给他的矿石要做的事情。","According to him, a cavity, more or less considerable, must exist in the mass of granite which supported Prospect Heights, and he intended to penetrate into it.To do this, the opening through which the water rushed must first be cleared, and the level lowered by making a larger outlet.Therefore an explosive substance must be manufactured, which would make a deep trench in some other part of the shore.This was what Harding was going to attempt with the minerals which nature placed at his disposal."
"不用说，大家都热情高涨地同意了这个计划，尤其是潘克洛夫。炸开花岗岩壁、制造人工瀑布这样的大手笔都很合乎水手的胃口。他会像当泥瓦匠或制靴匠那样，立马成为化学家，因为工程师需要化学制品。只要他们需要，他什么都会做，“甚至是舞蹈家和礼仪教授”，他对纳布说道，如果那也是需要的。","It is useless to say with what enthusiasm all, especially Pencroft, received this project.To employ great means, open the granite, create a cascade, that suited the sailor.And he would just as soon be a chemist as a mason or bootmaker, since the engineer wanted chemicals.He would be all that they liked, “even a professor of dancing and deportment,” said he to Neb, if that was ever necessary."
"纳布和潘克洛夫首先被委任负责提取儒艮身上的油脂，将肉保存，留作食用。他们对工程师深信不疑，连问题都没问就马上开始工作。几分钟以后，赛勒斯·哈丁、赫伯特及史佩莱也拖着筐子往煤层方向去了，那里有丰富的硫化铁矿石，是他们在最近的过渡土层中找到的，哈丁已经在那里找到一块标本。他们一整天都在忙着将这些矿石运到“石窟”，到了晚上，他们已经有好几吨矿石了。","Neb and Pencroft were first of all told to extract the grease from the dugong, and to keep the flesh, which was destined for food.Such perfect confidence had they in the engineer, that they set out directly, without even asking a question.A few minutes after them, Cyrus Harding, Herbert, and Gideon Spilett, dragging the hurdle, went towards the vein of coals, where those shistose pyrites abound which are met with in the most recent transition soil, and of which Harding had already found a specimen.All the day being employed in carrying a quantity of these stones to the Chimneys, by evening they had several tons."
"第二天，也就是5月8号，工程师开始部署他的计划。这些硫化铁矿石的主要成分是煤、燧石、氧化铝以及硫化铁，其中硫化铁含量非常高，必须尽快将硫化铁分离出来，将其转化为硫酸盐。只要取得硫酸盐，就可以提取硫酸了。","The next day, the 8th of May, the engineer began his manipulations.These shistose pyrites being composed principally of coal, flint, alumina, and sulphuret of iron—the latter in excess—it was necessary to separate the sulphuret of iron, and transform it into sulphate as rapidly as possible.The sulphate obtained, the sulphuric acid could then be extracted."
"硫酸就是他们想要获取的物质。硫酸是制造炸药最常用的物质，一个国家的制造业实力可以通过测量消费品的硫酸用量来衡量。这种酸后来对他们的用处非常大，可以用来制造蜡烛、鞣皮革等，但是这次工程师要将它留作他用。","This was the object to be attained.Sulphuric acid is one of the agents the most frequently employed, and the manufacturing importance of a nation can be measured by the consumption which is made of it.This acid would later be of great use to the settlers, in the manufacturing of candles, tanning skins, etc., but this time the engineer reserved it for another use."
"赛勒斯·哈丁在“石窟”的后面选了一块非常平坦的地方。他先在地面上铺了一层树枝和削好的木柴，在上面堆了一些黄铁矿石，让一个个矿石支撑着彼此，又在上面覆盖了一层薄薄的铁矿石，这些矿石已经被提前削到果仁大小。","Cyrus Harding chose, behind the Chimneys, a site where the ground was perfectly level.On this ground he placed a layer of branches and chopped wood, on which were piled some pieces of shistose pyrites, buttressed one against the other, the whole being covered with a thin layer of pyrites, previously reduced to the size of a nut."
"这样摆好了之后，他们就将木头点着，热量很快传到片麻岩上，片麻岩因为含有煤和硫磺，很快就燃烧起来。然后他们又添了几层碎矿石，堆成一大堆，在外面盖上土和草，中间还留有一些通气的孔，好像在把一堆木柴碳化，做成木炭似的。","This done, they set fire to the wood, the heat was communicated to the shist, which soon kindled, since it contains coal and sulphur.Then new layers of bruised pyrites were arranged so as to form an immense heap, the exterior of which was covered with earth and grass, several air-holes being left, as if it was a stack of wood which was to be carbonized to make charcoal."
"然后他们就让转化过程自然完成，让硫化铁变成硫酸铁，铝变成硫酸铝，这过程至少需要十到十二天，硫酸铁和硫酸铝都能在水中溶解，可是其他的如燧石、焦炭和煤渣是不溶于水的。","They then left the transformation to complete itself, and it would not take less than ten or twelve days for the sulphuret of iron to be changed to sulphate of iron and the alumina into sulphate of alumina, two equally soluble substances, the others, flint, burnt coal, and cinders, not being so."
"在进行这项化学工作的时候，赛勒斯·哈丁继续干着别的活，他们不只是带着热情工作，还有渴望。","While this chemical work was going on, Cyrus Harding proceeded with other operations, which were pursued with more than zeal,—it was eagerness."
"纳布和潘克洛夫已经将儒艮身上的油脂取下来，装在大陶罐里了。现在需要用皂化的方法把甘油从脂肪中分离出来。要完成这项任务，需要加入小苏打或石灰。事实上，用其中任何一种或其他类似物质分解油脂，都会在形成肥皂的同时将甘油分离出来，甘油正是工程师想要的。他们不需要石灰，用石灰只能做出钙质的肥皂，不能在水中溶解，所以是没有用的。然而用小苏打就能制作出可溶解的肥皂，可供日常使用。现在，像赛勒斯·哈丁这样讲求实际的人，宁愿试着获取苏打。弄到苏打很难吗？不难，因为岸边水生植物很多，有海篷子、番杏和各种漂上岸来的鹿角菜科。他们收集了大量的植物，先将它们晾干，然后就在露天的坑洞中焚烧。一连烧了好几天，最后得到一小堆灰色的粉末，很久以来，人们都把这种物质叫做“天然苏打”。","Neb and Pencroft had taken away the fat from the dugong, and placed it in large earthen pots.It was then necessary to separate the glycerine from the fat by saponifying it.Now, to obtain this result, it had to be treated either with soda or lime.In fact, one or other of these substances, after having attacked the fat, would form a soap by separating the glycerine, and it was just this glycerine which the engineer wished to obtain.There was no want of lime, only treatment by lime would give calcareous soap, insoluble, and consequently useless, while treatment by soda would furnish, on the contrary, a soluble soap, which could be put to domestic use.Now, a practical man, like Cyrus Harding, would rather try to obtain soda.Was this difficult?No; for marine plants abounded on the shore, glass-wort, ficoides, and all those fucaceae which form wrack.A large quantity of these plants was collected, first dried, then burnt in holes in the open air.The combustion of these plants was kept up for several days, and the result was a compact gray mass, which has been long known under the name of “natural soda.”"
"有了小苏打，工程师就将其用来和脂肪化合，得到了可以溶解的肥皂和中性物质——甘油。","This obtained, the engineer treated the fat with soda, which gave both a soluble soap and that neutral substance, glycerine."
"但是这还没有结束。为了以后着想，赛勒斯·哈丁还需要另一种物质——硝酸钾，通常叫做硝盐，或是硝石。","But this was not all.Cyrus Harding still needed, in view of his future preparation, another substance, nitrate of potash, which is better known under the name of salt niter, or of saltpeter."
"赛勒斯·哈丁可以用碳酸钾来得到这种物质，通过硝酸从蔬菜渣中获取碳酸钾是很容易的。而他们手上并没有碳酸钾，如果不是大自然有幸向他们提供硝酸，而他们只用动手捡起来，那么，他可能就有一些困难了。赫伯特在富兰克林山麓发现了一个硝酸盐脉，他们只要把这种盐提纯就可以了。","Cyrus Harding could have manufactured this substance by treating the carbonate of potash, which would be easily extracted from the cinders of the vegetables, by azotic acid.But this acid was wanting, and he would have been in some difficulty, if nature had not happily furnished the saltpeter, without giving them any other trouble than that of picking it up.Herbert found a vein of it at the foot of Mount Franklin, and they had nothing to do but purify this salt."
"这些工作持续了一个星期。在硫化铁转化成硫酸铁以前，这些工作就完成了。在接下来的几天，居民们抓紧时间砌了一个特别设置的砖炉，用来提纯将要得到的硫酸铁。到了5月18日左右，在化学转化过程快要终止的时候，所有的这些工作都完成了。几天来，吉丁·史佩莱、赫伯特、纳布和潘克洛夫在工程师的巧妙指导下，成了非常聪明的工人。在大师面前，人们最愿意听从能供己所需和最善于指导的人。","These different works lasted a week.They were finished before the transformation of the sulphuret into sulphate of iron had been accomplished.During the following days the settlers had time to construct a furnace of bricks of a particular arrangement, to serve for the distillation of the sulphate or iron when it had been obtained.All this was finished about the 18th of May, nearly at the time when the chemical transformation terminated.Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Neb, and Pencroft, skillfully directed by the engineer, had become most clever workmen.Before all masters, necessity is the one most listened to, and who teaches the best."
"在大堆的黄铁矿经过完全加热之后，他们把得到的硫酸铁、硫酸铝、燧石、煤渣和灰烬全放在一只盛水的盆子里。他们搅拌这些混合物，等固体沉淀下来，就把水倒出，得到一种含有硫酸铁和硫酸铝的纯净溶液，其他物质保持着固体的状态，因为它们是不能溶解的。最后，蒸发了一部分液体，硫酸铁结晶沉淀下来，没有蒸发的液体中含有硫酸铝，被扔掉了。","When the heap of pyrites had been entirely reduced by fire, the result of the operation, consisting of sulphate of iron, sulphate of alumina, flint, remains of coal, and cinders was placed in a basinful of water.They stirred this mixture, let it settle, then decanted it, and obtained a clear liquid containing in solution sulphate of iron and sulphate of alumina, the other matters remaining solid, since they are insoluble.Lastly, this liquid being partly evaporated, crystals of sulphate of iron were deposited, and the not evaporated liquid, which contained the sulphate of alumina, was thrown away."
"现在赛勒斯·哈丁手上有很多硫酸铁晶体，必须从中提取硫酸。制造硫酸需要很大成本。需要做方方面面的准备——一套专门的工具、铂金的仪器、不受酸腐蚀的铅室，其中铅室是化学转化的容器。这些东西工程师手中都没有，但是他知道波希米亚有一套简单易行的硫酸制造法，这种方法的另一个优点就是生产的硫酸浓度很高。北豪森酸就是用这种方法制成的。","Cyrus Harding had now at his disposal a large quantity of these sulphate of iron crystals, from which the sulphuric acid had to be extracted.The making of sulphuric acid is a very expensive manufacture.Considerable works are necessary—a special set of tools, an apparatus of platina, leaden chambers, unassailable by the acid, and in which the transformation is performed, etc.The engineer had none of these at his disposal, but he knew that, in Bohemia especially, sulphuric acid is manufactured by very simple means, which have also the advantage of producing it to a superior degree of concentration.It is thus that the acid known under the name of Nordhausen acid is made."
"赛勒斯现在只剩下最后一道工序就可以得到硫酸了，就是在一个封闭的瓶子中煅烧硫酸铁结晶，然后硫酸就以蒸气的形式蒸馏出来，蒸气经过液化就可以成为硫酸了。","To obtain sulphuric acid, Cyrus Harding had only one operation to make, to calcine the sulphate of iron crystals in a closed vase, so that the sulphuric acid should distil in vapor, which vapor, by condensation, would produce the acid."
"他们把结晶放在锅里，点着炉火，结晶就蒸馏成硫酸了。这项工程顺利地完成了，在5月20号，也就是开始工程的12天后，工程师已经制得了需要的硫酸，他希望能将其用在各种地方。","The crystals were placed in pots, and the heat from the furnace would distil the sulphuric acid.The operation was successfully completed, and on the 20th of May, twelve days after commencing it, the engineer was the possessor of the agent which later he hoped to use in so many different ways."
"可是，他为什么想得到硫酸呢？如果只是制作硝酸，那就很简单了，因为硝石与硫酸化合之后，通过蒸馏的方法就可以获取硝酸。","Now, why did he wish for this agent?Simply to produce azotic acid; and that was easy, since saltpeter, attacked by sulphuric acid, gives azotic, or nitric, acid by distillation."
"可是，他究竟想怎么利用硝酸呢？他的同伴们都还不清楚，因为他还没告诉他们工作成果的用途。","But, after all, how was he going to employ this azotic acid?His companions were still ignorant of this, for he had not informed them of the result at which he aimed."
"然而，工程师的目的已经几乎达成了，再经过一道工序，他就可以取得自己费了好大力气想要得到的东西。","However, the engineer had nearly accomplished his purpose, and by a last operation he would procure the substance which had given so much trouble."
"他拿出一些硝酸，将事先经蒸发提纯的甘油在蒸锅中混合起来，在冷却剂都没用的情况下，就得到了好几品脱的黄色混合油液。","Taking some azotic acid, he mixed it with glycerine, which had been previously concentrated by evaporation, subjected to the water-bath, and he obtained, without even employing a refrigerant mixture, several pints of an oily yellow mixture."
"最后一道工序是赛勒斯·哈丁单独完成的，他找了个远离“石窟”的僻静之地，怕发生爆炸的危险，当他将那一小瓶油液给朋友们看时，不无得意地说道：","This last operation Cyrus Harding had made alone, in a retired place, at a distance from the Chimneys, for he feared the danger of an explosion, and when he showed a bottle of this liquid to his friends, he contented himself with saying,—"
"“这就是硝化甘油！”","“Here is nitro-glycerine!”"
"就是这种可怕的产物，它的爆炸威力是普通炸药的十倍，已经引发了许多事故。但是，找到将它转化为炸药的方法后，也就是说与固体物质混在一起，如有足够渗透力来支撑它的粘土和糖，原本危险的液体就可以相对安全地使用了。但是，林肯岛的居民工作的时候，这种方法还不为人知。","It was really this terrible production, of which the explosive power is perhaps tenfold that of ordinary powder, and which has already caused so many accidents.However, since a way has been found to transform it into dynamite, that is to say, to mix with it some solid substance, clay or sugar, porous enough to hold it, the dangerous liquid has been used with some security.But dynamite was not yet known at the time when the settlers worked on Lincoln Island."
"“我们就用这种液体来炸岩石吗？”潘克洛夫怀疑地问道。","“And is it that liquid that is going to blow up our rocks?” said Pencroft incredulously."
"“对，我的朋友，”工程师回答道，“花岗岩石异常坚硬，会对爆破产生很大阻力，用这种硝化甘油可以取得理想的效果。”","“Yes, my friend,” replied the engineer, “and this nitro-glycerine will produce so much the more effect, as the granite is extremely hard, and will oppose a greater resistance to the explosion.”"
"“我们什么时候能见识见识，上尉？”","“And when shall we see this, captain?”"
"“就明天，等挖好埋炸药的坑就行了。”工程师回答道。","“To-morrow, as soon as we have dug a hole for the mine, replied the engineer.”"
"第二天，也就是5月21号，黎明时分，矿工们就出发到格兰特湖的东岸去了，这里距离海岸只有500英尺。在这里，湖水被坚硬的花岗岩石壁挡住了去路，高地开始顺着水体向下倾斜。因此，如果炸掉那道石壁，湖水就可以通过缺口流出去，形成一条小河，沿着倾斜的高地面向海滩冲去。因此，湖面就会大大降低，湖水流出的通道就会显露出来，这就是他们的最终目标。","The next day, the 21st of May, at daybreak, the miners went to the point which formed the eastern shore of Lake Grant, and was only five hundred feet from the coast.At this place, the plateau inclined downwards from the waters, which were only restrained by their granite case.Therefore, if this case was broken, the water would escape by the opening and form a stream, which, flowing over the inclined surface of the plateau, would rush on to the beach.Consequently, the level of the lake would be greatly lowered, and the opening where the water escaped would be exposed, which was their final aim."
"在工程师的指挥下，潘克洛夫舞动镐头，娴熟有力地凿着花岗岩石壁。坑是挖在岸边的斜坡上，因此要比湖面低得多。这样岩石在爆炸的威力下飞散后，就有一个大的缺口供水流向外冲出了。","Under the engineer’s directions, Pencroft, armed with a pickaxe, which he handled skillfully and vigorously, attacked the granite.The hole was made on the point of the shore, slanting, so that it should meet a much lower level than that of the water of the lake.In this way the explosive force, by scattering the rock, would open a large place for the water to rush out."
"这项工程花费了一些时间，工程师为了取得更好的爆破效果，决定至少使用七夸脱的硝化甘油。潘克洛夫和纳布轮班上阵，工程进展得很顺利，到了下午四点，炸药已经埋好了。","The work took some time, for the engineer, wishing to produce a great effect, intended to devote not less than seven quarts of nitro-glycerine to the operation.But Pencroft, relieved by Neb, did so well, that towards four o’clock in the evening, the mine was finished."
"现在又产生了一个问题，就是怎样点着炸药。通常来说，都是先点燃雷酸盐的雷管，燃烧起来的硝化甘油就会引爆。因此，必须有一股冲力来引起爆炸，因为只是点着的话，这种物质只能燃烧，不能产生爆炸。","Now the question of setting fire to the explosive substance was raised.Generally, nitro-glycerine is ignited by caps of fulminate, which in bursting cause the explosion.A shock is therefore needed to produce the explosion, for, simply lighted, this substance would burn without exploding."
"赛勒斯·哈丁一定制造了冲击雷管。在缺乏雷酸盐的情况下，他可以轻易地得到类似于棉火药的物质，因为他手中已经有硝酸了。只要把这种物质压在弹药筒中，再加上硝化甘油，就可以起到导火索的作用，引起爆炸。","Cyrus Harding could certainly have fabricated a percussion cap.In default of fulminate, he could easily obtain a substance similar to guncotton, since he had azotic acid at his disposal.This substance, pressed in a cartridge, and introduced among the nitro-glycerine, would burst by means of a fuse, and cause the explosion."
"赛勒斯知道硝化甘油在撞击之下会产生爆炸。他决定采用这样方法，如果不成功再另找出路。","But Cyrus Harding knew that nitro-glycerine would explode by a shock.He resolved to employ this means, and try another way, if this did not succeed."
"事实上，只要将少量的硝化甘油滴在坚硬的岩石上，再用锤子用力一击，就可以引发爆炸了。但是，敲锤的站在那里，不可能不成为爆炸的受害人。于是，哈丁想用一根纤维绳子将一块几磅重的铁块垂直吊在炸药坑洞的上面。另外一根纤维长绳，事先在硫磺中浸泡过，系在第一根绳子的中央，另一端放在离炸药几英尺以外的地面上。先把第二根绳子点着，一直等火烧到第一根绳子。当第一根绳子被烧断后，大铁块就会砸到硝化甘油上。安排妥当之后，工程师就让同伴们走到远处，他在坑中灌满了硝化甘油，一直到与坑口齐平。然后他又在岩石表面洒了几滴，这时候岩石上面的铁块已经悬好了。","In fact, the blow of a hammer on a few drops of nitro-glycerine, spread out on a hard surface, was enough to create an explosion.But the operator could not be there to give the blow, without becoming a victim to the operation.Harding, therefore, thought of suspending a mass of iron, weighing several pounds, by means of a fiber, to an upright just above the mine.Another long fiber, previously impregnated with sulphur, was attached to the middle of the first, by one end, while the other lay on the ground several feet distant from the mine.The second fiber being set on fire, it would burn till it reached the first.This catching fire in its turn, would break, and the mass of iron would fall on the nitro-glycerine.This apparatus being then arranged, the engineer, after having sent his companions to a distance, filled the hole, so that the nitro-glycerine was on a level with the opening; then he threw a few drops of it on the surface of the rock, above which the mass of iron was already suspended."
"安放完毕后，哈丁点着了沾有硫磺的绳子，然后离开，与同伴们一起回到“石窟”。","This done, Harding lit the end of the sulphured fiber, and leaving the place, he returned with his companions to the Chimneys."
"这根绳子估计要烧25分钟，果然，25钟后，只听见一声惊天动地的爆炸声。好像整个海岛底部都晃动起来。石块射向天空，像火山爆发一样。空气的激烈震荡产生了巨大的力量，“石窟”的岩块都颤动起来。居民们虽然离爆炸坑有两英里多远，也被掀翻在地。","The fiber was intended to burn five and twenty minutes, and, in fact, five and twenty minutes afterwards a most tremendous explosion was heard.The island appeared to tremble to its very foundation.Stones were projected in the air as if by the eruption of a volcano.The shock produced by the displacing of the air was such, that the rocks of the Chimneys shook.The settlers, although they were more than two miles from the mine, were thrown on the ground."
"他们站起来，爬上高地，向湖岸跑去，那里肯定已经被炸开。","They rose, climbed the plateau, and ran towards the place where the bank of the lake must have been shattered by the explosion."
"他们欢呼雀跃！他们看到花岗岩上的一个大缺口！一股白浪翻滚的急流从距离沙滩300英尺的高地上一泻千里！","A cheer escaped them!A large rent was seen in the granite!A rapid stream of water rushed foaming across the plateau and dashed down a height of three hundred feet on to the beach!"
"第十八章","Chapter 18"
"赛勒斯·哈丁的计划成功了，但是他还是像往常一样，没有表现出满意之情，紧闭着嘴唇，仔细地看着，一动也不动。赫伯特简直欣喜若狂，纳布高兴得跳了起来，潘克洛夫赞许得点着大脑袋，低语道：","Cyrus Harding’s project had succeeded, but, according to his usual habit he showed no satisfaction; with closed lips and a fixed look, he remained motionless.Herbert was in ecstasies, Neb bounded with joy, Pencroft nodded his great head, murmuring these words,—"
"“来看呀，我们的工程师太棒了！”","“Come, our engineer gets on capitally!”"
"硝化甘油的确显现了巨大的威力。炸开的口子很大，从开口流出来的水量至少是以前旧出口排水量的三倍。爆炸的结果是，不久后湖面将下降两英尺，甚至更多。","The nitro-glycerine had indeed acted powerfully.The opening which it had made was so large that the volume of water which escaped through this new outlet was at least treble that which before passed through the old one.The result was, that a short time after the operation the level of the lake would be lowered two feet, or more."
"居民们回到石窟，拿了几把镐、铁头矛、纤维绳索、燧石和钢块，然后回到高地上，托普也跟着大家。","The settlers went to the Chimneys to take some pickaxes, iron-tipped spears, string made of fibers, flint and steel; they then returned to the plateau, Top accompanying them."
"一路上，水手忍不住对工程师说：","On the way the sailor could not help saying to the engineer,—"
"“上尉，用你制作的那种神奇液体，可以把整个小岛都炸飞，你觉得呢？”","“Don’t you think, captain, that by means of that charming liquid you have made, one could blow up the whole of our island?”"
"“无疑，海岛、大陆、全世界都可以，”工程师答道，“只是用量多少的问题。”","“Without any doubt, the island, continents, and the world itself,” replied the engineer.“It is only a question of quantity.”"
"“那么你能用硝化甘油来做弹药火器吗？”水手问道。","“Then could you not use this nitro-glycerine for loading firearms?” asked the sailor."
"“不，潘克洛夫，它太容易爆炸了。不过用它来制作棉火药，甚至普通火药是不难的，因为我们有硝酸、硝石、硫磺和炭了。可惜我们没有枪。”","“No, Pencroft; for it is too explosive a substance.But it would be easy to make some guncotton, or even ordinary powder, as we have azotic acid, saltpeter, sulphur, and coal.Unhappily, it is the guns which we have not got.”"
"“啊，上尉，”水手应道，“只要有一点决心——”","“Oh, captain,” replied the sailor, “with a little determination—”"
"潘克洛夫已经把“不可能”从林肯岛的字典上抹去了。","Pencroft had erased the word “impossible” from the dictionary of Lincoln Island."
"居民们到达眺望岗上后，就马上向炸开的旧排水口走去。这个出口现在可以通行了，因为水不再从中流出，勘探内部就变得轻而易举了。","The settlers, having arrived at Prospect Heights, went immediately towards that point of the lake near which was the old opening now uncovered.This outlet had now become practicable, since the water no longer rushed through it, and it would doubtless be easy to explore the interior."
"几分钟后，他们已经来到湖面相对较低的一边，从这里一眼就可以看出，他们的目的达到了。","In a few minutes the settlers had reached the lower point of the lake, and a glance showed them that the object had been attained."
"事实上，湖的这边露出了他们搜寻已久的洞口，现在这个洞已经在水面上了。湖水退去之后，留下一道狭窄的山脊，他们可以走进洞口了。这个洞口有将近20英尺宽，但高度才不到两英尺。它很像人行道边的排水沟口一样，因此居民们没有容易的通道可以走进去，但是纳布和潘克洛夫很快用镐将洞口凿到了合适的高度。","In fact, in the side of the lake, and now above the surface of the water, appeared the long-looked-for opening.A narrow ridge, left bare by the retreat of the water, allowed them to approach it.This orifice was nearly twenty feet in width, but scarcely two in height.It was like the mouth of a drain at the edge of the pavement, and therefore did not offer an easy passage to the settlers; but Neb and Pencroft, taking their pickaxes, soon made it of a suitable height."
"然后工程师走上前，他发现开口的这边，至少是洞口上半部分的坡度最多也不过30到35度。因此是可以通行的，假如坡度没有增加，一直降到和海平面一样高的地方都不成问题。如果花岗岩石壁的内部有一些很大的洞穴，那用处可就大了。","The engineer then approached, and found that the sides of the opening, in its upper part at least, had not a slope of more than from thirty to thirty-five degrees.It was therefore practicable, and, provided that the declivity did not increase, it would be easy to descend even to the level of the sea.If then, as was probable, some vast cavity existed in the interior of the granite, it might, perhaps, be of great use."
"“那么，上尉，我们还呆着干什么？”水手问道，他已经迫不及待想要进入狭长的通道之中，“你看，托普已经在我们之前进去了！”","“Well, captain, what are we stopping for?” asked the sailor, impatient to enter the narrow passage.“You see Top has got before us!”"
"“很好，”工程师回答道，“可是我们一定要看清前面的路。纳布，去砍一些带树脂的树枝来。”","“Very well,” replied the engineer.“But we must see our way.Neb, go and cut some resinous branches.”"
"湖边长着绿荫如盖的松树和其他绿树，纳布和赫伯特跑过去，很快折了些树枝回来，做成了火把。他们用燧石和钢片将火把点着，于是赛勒斯·哈丁就带领大家冒险进入黑色通道里，这里原本灌满了多余的湖水。","Neb and Herbert ran to the edge of the lake, shaded with pines and other green trees, and soon returned with some branches, which they made into torches.The torches were lighted with flint and steel, and Cyrus Harding leading, the settlers ventured into the dark passage, which the overplus of the lake had formerly filled."
"出乎意料的是，探险者们越往里走，通道的直径越长，不一会儿，他们就可以直起身子来了。花岗岩石经过流水长年累月的冲刷，表面非常滑，有摔跤的危险。但是，居民们采取了爬山时常用的办法，用绳索将大家连在一起。幸好花岗岩的突出部分形成了规则的阶梯，这样往下走就不那么危险了。在火把的光下，岩顶挂着的水滴到处闪闪发光，探险者们猜想，岩壁分布着不计其数的钟乳石。工程师仔细查看着这块黑黑的花岗岩。里面没有一个地层，连一条缝隙都没有。这一大块岩石很结实，纹理紧密。这条通道的历史要追溯到海岛的起源了。它的形成并不是由于水一点一点将其掏空。是冥神而不是海神用他的力量造了这条通道，岩壁上火山喷发的痕迹还清晰可辨，冲刷的水流也未能将这些痕迹完全抹去。","Contrary to what might have been supposed, the diameter of the passage increased as the explorers proceeded, so that they very soon were able to stand upright.The granite, worn by the water for an infinite time, was very slippery, and falls were to be dreaded.But the settlers were all attached to each other by a cord, as is frequently done in ascending mountains.Happily some projections of the granite, forming regular steps, made the descent less perilous.Drops, still hanging from the rocks, shone here and there under the light of the torches, and the explorers guessed that the sides were clothed with innumerable stalactites.The engineer examined this black granite.There was not a stratum, not a break in it.The mass was compact, and of an extremely close grain.The passage dated, then, from the very origin of the island.It was not the water which little by little had hollowed it.Pluto and not Neptune had bored it with his own hand, and on the wall traces of an eruptive work could be distinguished, which all the washing of the water had not been able totally to efface."
"他们往下走的速度很慢。他们冒险进入未知的深度，只感到恐惧，这条通道第一次有人类踏足。他们默默不语，陷入了沉思，考虑的事情不止一件，因为这里与海相通，一些腔肠动物或是巨大的头足类动物可能栖息在洞的内部。然而，托普一直走在小队的前头，他们可以依靠它的机智，在必要的时候它会发出警报的。","The settlers descended very slowly.They could not but feel a certain awe, in this venturing into these unknown depths, for the first time visited by human beings.They did not speak, but they thought; and the thought came to more than one, that some polypus or other gigantic cephalopod might inhabit the interior cavities, which were in communication with the sea.However, Top kept at the head of the little band, and they could rely on the sagacity of the dog, who would not fail to give the alarm if there was any need for it."
"顺着蜿蜒的通道下行了大约有一百英尺后，一直走路的哈丁停了下来，他的同伴们也来到了他跟前。他们停住的地方要开阔一些，形成了一个大小适中的山洞。水滴从洞顶滴下来，但这并不能表明水是从岩石中渗下来的。水滴只不过是多年来岩洞中轰鸣而过的水流留下的最后残迹，这里的空气虽然有些潮湿但是却很新鲜，没有散发丝毫臭气。","After having descended about a hundred feet, following a winding road, Harding who was walking on before, stopped, and his companions came up with him.The place where they had halted was wider, so as to form a cavern of moderate dimensions.Drops of water fell from the vault, but that did not prove that they oozed through the rock.They were simply the last traces left by the torrent which had so long thundered through this cavity, and the air there was pure though slightly damp, but producing no mephitic exhalation."
"“嗯，亲爱的赛勒斯，”吉丁·史佩莱说道，“这个地方是个安全的住所，藏在岩石深处，但它不能住人。”","“Well, my dear Cyrus,” said Gideon Spilett, “here is a very secure retreat, well hid in the depths of the rock, but it is, however, uninhabitable.”"
"“为什么不能住人？”水手问道。","“Why uninhabitable?” asked the sailor."
"“因为这里空间太小，光线太暗。”","“Because it is too small and too dark.”"
"“难道我们不能把它凿大一些，挖空一些，再开几个窟窿透亮通风吗？”潘克洛夫回应道，他现在认为凡事皆有可能。","“Couldn’t we enlarge it, hollow it out, make openings to let in light and air?” replied Pencroft, who now thought nothing impossible."
"“我们继续向前探险吧，”赛勒斯·哈丁说道，“也许再往下一点，大自然会帮我们省下那一番力气的。”","“Let us go on with our exploration,” said Cyrus Harding.“Perhaps lower down, nature will have spared us this labor.”"
"“我们才走了通道的三分之一。”赫伯特观察后说。","“We have only gone a third of the way,” observed Herbert."
"“将近三分之一，”哈丁说道，“我们从洞口往下走一百英尺——”","“Nearly a third,” replied Harding, “for we have descended a hundred feet from the opening, and it is not impossible that a hundred feet farther down—”"
"“托普哪里去了？”纳布问道，打断了主人的话。","“Where is Top?” asked Neb, interrupting his master."
"他们在岩洞中找了一会儿，但是没有找到。","They searched the cavern, but the dog was not there."
"“它很有可能是继续往前走了。”潘克洛夫说道。","“Most likely he has gone on,” said Pencroft."
"“我们跟上去吧。”哈丁说。","“Let us join him,” replied Harding."
"他们继续往下走着。工程师仔细勘察通道的所有岔路，尽管岔路很多，他还是能轻易救讲出通向大海的大致方向。","The descent was continued.The engineer carefully observed all the deviations of the passage, and notwithstanding so many detours, he could easily have given an account of its general direction, which went towards the sea."
"居民们又往下走了50英尺远，从深处传来的声音引起了他们的注意。他们停下来听着。声音通过通道传来，就像通过一个声管一样，清楚地传到耳朵里。","The settlers had gone some fifty feet farther, when their attention was attracted by distant sounds which came up from the depths.They stopped and listened.These sounds, carried through the passage as through an acoustic tube, came clearly to the ear."
"“那是托普在叫！”赫伯特喊道。","“That is Top barking!” cried Herbert."
"“是的，”潘克洛夫答道，“我们勇敢的狗正在狂吠呢！”","“Yes,” replied Pencroft, “and our brave dog is barking furiously!”"
"“我们有铁头矛，”赛勒斯·哈丁说，“大家保持警惕，前进！”","“We have our iron-tipped spears,” said Cyrus Harding.“Keep on your guard, and forward!”"
"“变得越来越有意思了。”吉丁·史佩莱低声对水手说，水手点点头。哈丁和同伴们冲过去想助狗一臂之力。托普的叫声越来越清楚，而且异常暴烈。它不会是侵犯了什么动物的巢穴，正在搏斗中吧？探险家们在难以抗拒的好奇心的驱使下，连可能遇到的危险都不顾，就又往下走了16英尺，几分钟之后，他们找到了托普。","“It is becoming more and more interesting,” murmured Gideon Spilett in the sailor’s ear, who nodded.Harding and his companions rushed to the help of their dog.Top’s barking became more and more perceptible, and it seemed strangely fierce.Was he engaged in a struggle with some animal whose retreat he had disturbed?Without thinking of the danger to which they might be exposed, the explorers were now impelled by an irresistible curiosity, and in a few minutes, sixteen feet lower they rejoined Top."
"这里是通道的尽头，有一个又宽又大的岩洞。","There the passage ended in a vast and magnificent cavern."
"托普来来回回地奔跑着，狂吠着。潘克洛夫和纳布挥舞着手中的火把，将洞的每一个缝隙都照遍了，与此同时，哈丁、史佩莱和赫伯特都举起自己的矛，随时准备应对可能发生的紧急情况。巨大的岩洞空空如也。居民们将每个方向都搜查遍了。里面什么也没有，没有任何动物，也没有人，然而，托普还是继续叫唤着。爱抚和恐吓都不能使它停下来。","Top was running backwards and forwards, barking furiously.Pencroft and Neb, waving their torches, threw the light into every crevice; and at the same time, Harding, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert, their spears raised, were ready for any emergency which might arise.The enormous cavern was empty.The settlers explored it in every direction.There was nothing there, not an animal, not a human being; and yet Top continued to bark.Neither caresses nor threats could make him be silent."
"“湖水一定是通过一个地方流进大海的。”工程师说。","“There must be a place somewhere, by which the waters of the lake reached the sea,” said the engineer."
"“当然，”潘克洛夫答道，“大家都要留神，不要掉到窟窿里去。”","“Of course,” replied Pencroft, “and we must take care not to tumble into a hole.”"
"“走，托普，走！”哈丁喊道。","“Go, Top, go!” cried Harding."
"托普在主人的话的刺激下，就跑到洞的尽头去了，在那里它叫得更起劲了。","The dog, excited by his master’s words, ran towards the extremity of the cavern, and there redoubled his barking."
"他们跟上他，通过火把的光亮，看见花岗石地面上有一个规则的井口。湖水就是通过它流向海里的，但是这一次就不是倾斜的、可通行的通道了，而是一口垂直的井，要想下去冒险是不可能的。","They followed him, and by the light of the torches, perceived the mouth of a regular well in the granite.It was by this that the water escaped; and this time it was not an oblique and practicable passage, but a perpendicular well, into which it was impossible to venture."
"他们把火把凑到井口来，但是什么也看不见。哈丁把一根点着的树枝扔下了深渊。燃烧的树脂在快速下坠的过程中越来越亮，照亮了井的内部，但是什么也没有。只听见嗤的一声，火灭了，说明树枝已经落在水里，也就是海面上。","The torches were held over the opening: nothing could be seen.Harding took a lighted branch, and threw it into the abyss.The blazing resin, whose illuminating power increased still more by the rapidity of its fall, lighted up the interior of the well, but yet nothing appeared.The flame then went out with a slight hiss, which showed that it had reached the water, that is to say, the level of the sea."
"工程师根据树枝降落的时间，能算出井的深度，大约有90英尺。","The engineer, calculating the time employed in its fall, was able to calculate the depth of the well, which was found to be about ninety feet."
"也就是说岩洞的地面离海平面有90英尺。","The floor of the cavern must thus be situated ninety feet above the level of the sea."
"“这里就是我们的住所。”赛勒斯·哈丁说。","“Here is our dwelling,” said Cyrus Harding."
"“但是这里有某些生物住着。”吉丁·史佩莱说道，他的好奇心还没有得到满足。","“But it was occupied by some creature,” replied Gideon Spilett, whose curiosity was not yet satisfied."
"“好吧，不管是不是两栖动物，它已经从这个井口离开了，”工程师答道，“将这个地方让给我们了。”","“Well, the creature, amphibious or otherwise, has made off through this opening,” replied the engineer, “and has left the place for us.”"
"“不要紧，”水手补充道，“我真想变成托普，哪怕是一刻钟也好，它可从来都不乱叫！”","“Never mind,” added the sailor, “I should like very much to be Top just for a quarter of an hour, for he doesn’t bark for nothing!”"
"赛勒斯·哈丁看着他的狗，靠近他的同伴可以听见他低语道：","Cyrus Harding looked at his dog, and those of his companions who were near him might have heard him murmur these words,—"
"“是的，我相信托普比我们知道的多多了。”","“Yes, I believe that Top knows more than we do about a great many things.”"
"无论如何，居民们的愿望大部分都得到了满足。上天的眷顾，再加上他们领袖的非凡智慧，已经给了他们天大的帮助。他们现在拥有了一个宽敞的岩洞，现在仅靠火把微弱的光线还不能算出山洞的大小，但是用砖头把这里隔成一个个房间是很容易的，如果不把它作为房子，至少可以把它作为一幢宽敞的公寓。流出去的水再也不会流回来了。这个地方终于空出来了。","However, the wishes of the settlers were for the most part satisfied.Chance, aided by the marvelous sagacity of their leader, had done them great service.They had now at their disposal a vast cavern, the size of which could not be properly calculated by the feeble light of their torches, but it would certainly be easy to divide it into rooms, by means of brick partitions, or to use it, if not as a house, at least as a spacious apartment.The water which had left it could not return.The place was free."
"现在还有两大困难：首先，要在坚固的岩石中开辟小洞，让光照进洞中；其次，必须找到更加容易进入山洞的方法。想让阳光从上面照进来是没有用的，因为构成顶部的花岗岩又厚又硬。但是，也许可以把靠近大海的外围岩石凿开。赛勒斯·哈丁在往下走的过程中，粗略计算出了通道的倾斜度和长度，因此，他相信外围的岩壁不是很厚。如果这样就可以得到阳光，开辟通道也可以如法炮制。因为开出一扇门和开一扇窗子是很容易的，还可以在外面搭一架梯子。","Two difficulties remained; firstly, the possibility of lighting this excavation in the midst of solid rock; secondly, the necessity of rendering the means of access more easy.It was useless to think of lighting it from above, because of the enormous thickness of the granite which composed the ceiling; but perhaps the outer wall next the sea might be pierced.Cyrus Harding, during the descent, had roughly calculated its obliqueness, and consequently the length of the passage, and was therefore led to believe that the outer wall could not be very thick.If light was thus obtained, so would a means of access, for it would be as easy to pierce a door as windows, and to establish an exterior ladder."
"哈丁将自己的想法告诉了同伴。","Harding made known his ideas to his companions."
"“那么，上尉，让我们开始干吧！”潘克洛夫说道，“我这里有镐，很快就可以从岩壁开出通道。我应该从哪里动手呢？”","“Then, captain, let us set to work!” replied Pencroft.“I have my pickaxe, and I shall soon make my way through this wall.Where shall I strike?”"
"“这里。”工程师回答道。他将一个深凹进去的地方指给强健的水手看，那个地方的岩石比别处薄很多。","“Here,” replied the engineer, showing the sturdy sailor a considerable recess in the side, which would much diminish the thickness."
"这半个小时，潘克洛夫都在火把的照耀下凿花岗岩，碎石在他身边四溅。半小时之后，纳布过来替换他，后来史佩莱又接替了纳布。","Pencroft attacked the granite, and for half an hour, by the light of the torches, he made the splinters fly around him.Neb relieved him, then Spilett took Neb’s place."
"这项工作一直持续了两个小时，就在他们开始担心用镐凿不透这个石壁时，吉丁·史佩莱的最后一记重击竟凿穿了岩壁，连工具都掉到外边去了。","This work had lasted two hours, and they began to fear that at this spot the wall would not yield to the pickaxe, when at a last blow given by Gideon Spilett, the instrument, passing through the rock, fell outside."
"“哈哈！哈哈！”潘克洛夫大叫起来。","“Hurrah! hurrah!” cried Pencroft."
"这里的石壁只有三英尺厚。","The wall only measured there three feet in thickness."
"哈丁把眼睛凑在壁孔上，从这里俯瞰地面，足有80英尺高。在他面前延伸的是海岸线、小岛，更远处就是一望无际的大海了。","Harding applied his eye to the aperture, which overlooked the ground from a height of eighty feet.Before him was extended the sea-coast, the islet, and beyond the open sea."
"大量的阳光从这个小洞照进来，照亮了这个宏伟的岩洞，产生一种不可思议的效果！岩洞左侧的高度和宽度还不足30英尺，但是右侧却十分宽敞，成拱形的洞顶高达80英尺以上。","Floods of light entered by this hole, inundating the splendid cavern and producing a magic effect!On its left side it did not measure more than thirty feet in height and breadth, but on the right it was enormous, and its vaulted roof rose to a height of more than eighty feet."
"在一些地方分布着不规则的花岗岩石柱，支撑着拱形的洞顶，就像大教堂中殿里的圆柱子，这里形成横向的支柱，那里是椭圆形的拱门，被尖尖的线脚装饰着，隐没在黑暗的角落里。在阴暗处可见的奇妙拱门中，表面覆盖着大量的突出物，像许多垂饰一样。这个山洞简直是人造的拜占庭、罗马和哥特式建筑风格的生动集合。然而这些都是大自然的杰作。大自然在大块花岗岩石壁中，挖出了这一块亚亨伯拉式的洞天福地。","In some places granite pillars, irregularly disposed, supported the vaulted roof, as those in the nave of a cathedral, here forming lateral piers, there elliptical arches, adorned with pointed moldings, losing themselves in dark bays, amid the fantastic arches of which glimpses could be caught in the shade, covered with a profusion of projections formed like so many pendants.This cavern was a picturesque mixture of all the styles of Byzantine, Roman, or Gothic architecture ever produced by the hand of man.And yet this was only the work of nature.She alone had hollowed this fairy Aihambra in a mass of granite."
"居民们不住地赞叹着。原本他们只是期盼找到一个狭窄的洞穴，现在发现了这样一个宏大的宫殿，纳布像被运到一座神庙似的，帽子都摘下来了。","The settlers were overwhelmed with admiration.Where they had only expected to find a narrow cavity, they had found a sort of marvelous palace, and Neb had taken off his hat, as if he had been transported into a temple!"
"人人都对洞穴的宏伟赞不绝口。欢笑声在岩洞中回荡着，回音一遍一遍地重复着，直到消失在黑暗的中殿中。","Cries of admiration issued from every mouth.Hurrahs resounded, and the echo was repeated again and again till it died away in the dark naves."
"“啊，我的朋友们！”赛勒斯·哈丁大声说，“等我们照亮了宫殿的内部，就把左边当作房间和储藏室，还要把这个壮丽的岩洞作为我们的书房和博物馆！”","“Ah, my friends!” exclaimed Cyrus Harding, “when we have lighted the interior of this place, and have arranged our rooms and storehouses in the left part, we shall still have this splendid cavern, which we will make our study and our museum!”"
"“我们给它起个什么名字呢？”赫伯特问道。","“And we will call it?—” asked Herbert."
"“花岗石宫。”哈丁回答道，同伴们听后都欢呼起来。","“Granite House,” replied Harding; a name which his companions again saluted with a cheer."
"现在火把几乎都烧尽了，因为他们还必须过通道，返回到高地的最高处，他们决定将整理新住宅的必要工作推迟到第二天。","The torches were now almost consumed, and as they were obliged to return by the passage to reach the summit of the plateau, it was decided to put off the work necessary for the arrangement of their new dwelling till the next day."
"临走之前，赛勒斯·哈丁又趴在黑乎乎的井口上，它垂直着一直下降到海平面。他全神贯注地听着。井底没有任何声响，连水的声音都没有，而波涛有时应该会在深处搅动的。他又往下扔了一根燃烧的树枝。井的四周马上被照亮了一下子，然而还是和第一次一样，没看见什么可疑的。","Before departing, Cyrus Harding leaned once more over the dark well, which descended perpendicularly to the level of the sea.He listened attentively.No noise was heard, not even that of the water, which the undulations of the surge must sometimes agitate in its depths.A flaming branch was again thrown in.The sides of the well were lighted up for an instant, but as at the first time, nothing suspicious was seen."
"即便真有什么水兽，也会由于湖水消退而倍感诧异，在新通道打开之前，它这一次会从这条地下通道返回到大海。","If some marine monster had been surprised unawares by the retreat of the water, he would by this time have regained the sea by the subterranean passage, before the new opening had been offered to him."
"在此期间，工程师一动不动地注视着深渊，一句话也不说。","Meanwhile, the engineer was standing motionless, his eyes fixed on the gulf, without uttering a word."
"水手走到他身边，碰了碰他的胳膊，说：“上尉！”","The sailor approached him, and touching his arm, “Captain!” said he."
"“怎么了，我的朋友？”工程师问道，好像刚从梦中醒来一样。","“What do you want, my friend?” asked the engineer, as if he had returned from the land of dreams."
"“火把马上就要灭了”","“The torches will soon go out.”"
"“走吧！”哈丁回答道。","“Forward!” replied Cyrus Harding."
"小队离开了石洞，开始往漆黑的通道上爬去。托普跟在后面，还时不时地咆哮两声。往上走很艰难。居民们在上面的洞穴里休息了几分钟，在这漫长的花岗石梯阶上，这里好像是一个中途休息站。接着他们又向上爬去。","The little band left the cavern and began to ascend through the dark passage.Top closed the rear, still growling every now and then.The ascent was painful enough.The settlers rested a few minutes in the upper grotto, which made a sort of landing-place halfway up the long granite staircase.Then they began to climb again."
"很快就感受到了新鲜的空气。石壁上的水珠被蒸发掉了，不再闪闪发光了。燃烧的火把逐渐暗淡下去。纳布手中的火把已经熄灭了，如果他们不想在黑暗中探路，就得加快脚步了。","Soon fresher air was felt.The drops of water, dried by evaporation, no longer sparkled on the walls.The flaring torches began to grow dim.The one which Neb carried went out, and if they did not wish to find their way in the dark, they must hasten."
"于是他们加快了脚步，在将近四点的时候，水手手中的火把熄灭了，赛勒斯·哈丁和同伴们走出了通道。","This was done, and a little before four o’clock, at the moment when the sailor’s torch went out in its turn, Cyrus Harding and his companions passed out of the passage."
"第十九章","Chapter 19"
"第二天是5月22号，整理新家的工作开始了。事实上，居民们渴望把空间不大的“石窟”住所换成这个又宽敞又干净的岩洞，它隐藏在坚固的岩石中，海水灌不着，雨水淋不着。他们不会完全丢弃之前的住处，因为工程师打算将那里作为工厂，做重要的工作。赛勒斯·哈丁当前的第一要务就是要从外面找到花岗石宫的正面位置。他来到沙滩上，因为从记者手中掉下的镐一定垂直落在了峭壁的下面，所以只要找到镐，就能知道凿穿花岗岩形成的洞所在何处了。","The next day, the 22nd of May, the arrangement of their new dwelling was commenced.In fact, the settlers longed to exchange the insufficient shelter of the Chimneys for this large and healthy retreat, in the midst of solid rock, and sheltered from the water both of the sea and sky.Their former dwelling was not, however, to be entirely abandoned, for the engineer intended to make a manufactory of it for important works.Cyrus Harding’s first care was to find out the position of the front of Granite House from the outside.He went to the beach, and as the pickaxe when it escaped from the hands of the reporter must have fallen perpendicularly to the foot of the cliff, the finding it would be sufficient to show the place where the hole had been pierced in the granite."
"那只镐很容易就找到了，它插在沙里，沿着这点垂直向上，就能看到洞。一些原鸽已经从窄小的洞中飞进飞出了，它们显然认为花岗石宫是为它们而凿穿的。工程师打算将石洞隔成几个大小合适的房间，最前面留一条进门过道。为了取光，再在前面凿开五个窗户和一扇门。潘克洛夫对凿开五扇窗户的想法很满意，但是他不能理解门的用处，因为通道已经提供了一个天然阶梯，通过它进入花岗石宫很容易。","The pickaxe was easily found, and the hole could be seen in a perpendicular line above the spot where it was stuck in the sand.Some rock pigeons were already flying in and out of the narrow opening; they evidently thought that Granite House had been discovered on purpose for them.It was the engineer’s intention to divide the right portion of the cavern into several rooms, preceded by an entrance passage, and to light it by means of five windows and a door, pierced in the front.Pencroft was much pleased with the five windows, but he could not understand the use of the door, since the passage offered a natural staircase, through which it would always be easy to enter Granite House."
"“我的朋友，”哈丁回答说，“如果我们能很轻易地通过这条通道到达住处，那对于别人也是同等容易的。我的意思是，相反，我们要紧紧地把洞口封住，如果有必要，做一个堤坝，完全掩盖进口，这样湖水会升高。","“My friend,” replied Harding, “if it is easy for us to reach our dwelling by this passage, it will be equally easy for others besides us.I mean, on the contrary, to block up that opening, to seal it hermetically, and, if it is necessary, to completely hide the entrance by making a dam, and thus causing the water of the lake to rise.”"
"“那么我们自己怎么进去呢？”水手问道。","“And how shall we get in?” asked the sailor."
"“用梯子从外面进来，”赛勒斯·哈丁答道，“做一个绳梯，只要把梯子吊起来，谁也没法进入我们的住处了。”","“By an outside ladder,” replied Cyrus Harding, “a rope ladder, which, once drawn up, will render access to our dwelling impossible.”"
"“但是，要这么多防范措施干嘛呢？”潘克洛夫问道，“到现在为止，我们还没有看见什么危险的动物。要是说岛上有什么土著人，我就更不相信了！”","“But why so many precautions?” asked Pencroft.“As yet we have seen no dangerous animals.As to our island being inhabited by natives, I don’t believe it!”"
"“你非常肯定吗，潘克洛夫？”工程师问道，看着水手。","“Are you quite sure of that, Pencroft?” asked the engineer, looking at the sailor."
"“当然，我们不能非常肯定，直到我们查遍小岛的每个方向。”潘克洛夫回答道。","“Of course we shall not be quite sure, till we have explored it in every direction,” replied Pencroft."
"“是的，”哈丁说道，“我们只知道了岛的一小部分而已。不管怎么样，即使我们在岛内没有敌人，也可能会有外敌入侵，因为太平洋上有些地方是很凶险的。我们必须为防备一切意外做准备。”","“Yes,” said Harding, “for we know only a small portion of it as yet.But at any rate, if we have no enemies in the interior, they may come from the exterior, for parts of the Pacific are very dangerous.We must be provided against every contingency.”"
"赛勒斯·哈丁的话是很英明的，潘克洛夫没进一步反对，准备执行他的指示。","Cyrus Harding spoke wisely; and without making any further objection, Pencroft prepared to execute his orders."
"于是，花岗石宫的正面被五扇窗子和一道门照亮了，此外，还开了一扇向外突出的大窗和几扇稍小的椭圆形窗户，大量的阳光就透进了这个宏伟的中殿，这将成为他们的主屋。花岗石宫的正面在离地面80英尺的高处，朝着东面，初升的太阳用第一缕阳光迎接它。他们发现，峭壁的这一块正好在慈悲河口突出的部分和形成“石窟”的岩石堆正上方之间的中间地带。这样东北风就只能从侧面吹来，岩石的突出部分保护了这里。除此以外，工程师还打算在窗框做好以前，先安上厚实的百叶窗，和外界隔起来，以防止风雨漏进石宫中，在必要的时候，还可以把百叶窗隐藏起来。","The front of Granite House was then to be lighted by five windows and a door, besides a large bay window and some smaller oval ones, which would admit plenty of light to enter into the marvelous nave which was to be their chief room.This facade, situated at a height of eighty feet above the ground, was exposed to the east, and the rising sun saluted it with its first rays.It was found to be just at that part of the cliff which was between the projection at the mouth of the Mercy and a perpendicular line traced above the heap of rocks which formed the Chimneys.Thus the winds from the northeast would only strike it obliquely, for it was protected by the projection.Besides, until the window-frames were made, the engineer meant to close the openings with thick shutters, which would prevent either wind or rain from entering, and which could be concealed in need."
"第一步工作就是凿洞。单靠镐开凿要花费很长时间才能完成，但大家都知道哈丁是个机敏的人。他手上还有一些硝化甘油没有用完，正好在这件事上发挥了效用。在自己选定的岩石位置上，工程师用炸药将岩石炸开了。然后，大家就用锹和镐将门和窗凿成形，参差不齐的边缘也被凿平了。工作开展几天后，初升的太阳就洒满了整个花岗石宫，连最隐蔽的地方也被照亮了。根据赛勒斯·哈丁的计划，他们打算将石宫分成面朝大海的五个房间；在右边的入口开一道门，门外安上梯子；然后是一间长30英尺的厨房；一间40英尺长的饭厅和同样大小的卧室；最后在大厅旁边开凿一间“会客室”，这是潘克洛夫的请求。这些房间，更准确地说是这套房间，并不能占据整个石洞的空间。他们还打算开辟一个走廊和一间仓库，将工具、食品和备用品放在仓库里。岛上的所有物产，无论是植物还是动物，放在这里都会被储存在最好状态，完全不会受潮。现在一点儿也不缺少空间，所以可以井然有序地放置每一样东西了。此外，在大洞穴上面还有一个小洞穴供拓荒者们使用，它就像新居的阁楼。","The first work was to make the openings.This would have taken too long with the pickaxe alone, and it is known that Harding was an ingenious man.He had still a quantity of nitro-glycerine at his disposal, and he employed it usefully.By means of this explosive substance the rock was broken open at the very places chosen by the engineer.Then, with the pickaxe and spade, the windows and doors were properly shaped, the jagged edges were smoothed off, and a few days alter the beginning of the work, Granite House was abundantly lighted by the rising sun, whose rays penetrated into its most secret recesses.Following the plan proposed by Cyrus Harding, the space was to be divided into five compartments looking out on the sea; to the right, an entry with a door, which would meet the ladder; then a kitchen, thirty feet long; a dining-room, measuring forty feet; a sleeping-room, of equal size; and lastly, a “Visitor’s room,” petitioned for by Pencroft, and which was next to the great hall.These rooms, or rather this suite of rooms, would not occupy all the depth of the cave.There would be also a corridor and a storehouse, in which their tools, provisions, and stores would be kept.All the productions of the island, the flora as well as the fauna, were to be there in the best possible state of preservation, and completely sheltered from the damp.There was no want of space, so that each object could be methodically arranged.Besides, the colonists had still at their disposal the little grotto above the great cavern, which was like the garret of the new dwelling."
"计划拟定以后，就只等实施了。矿工们现在又变成了制砖工人，然后，砖头被搬到花岗石宫下边来了。直到这时，哈丁和他的同伴们一直都是通过狭长的通道进入岩洞的。这样的进入方式使他们必须先爬上高地，绕过河岸，再沿着通道往下走200英尺，当返回高地时，还要再向上爬相同的距离。这样不但浪费很长的时间，也很吃力。因此，赛勒斯·哈丁下决心立即制造一个结实的绳梯，一旦将梯子挂起来，就再没有其他通道到达花岗石宫了。","This plan settled, it had only to be put into execution.The miners became brickmakers again, then the bricks were brought to the foot of Granite House.Till then, Harding and his companions had only entered the cavern by the long passage.This mode of communication obliged them first to climb Prospect Heights, making a detour by the river’s bank, and then to descend two hundred feet through the passage, having to climb as far when they wished to return to the plateau.This was a great loss of time, and was also very fatiguing.Cyrus Harding, therefore, resolved to proceed without any further delay to the fabrication of a strong rope ladder, which, once raised, would render Granite House completely inaccessible."
"他们极其细致地做梯子，梯子竖直的部分是用一种爬藤植物的弯曲纤维制成的，像粗缆绳那样结实。梯子的横档是用一种红杉的树枝编成的，既轻巧又结实，所有的设备都是由潘克洛夫的巧手制成的。","This ladder was manufactured with extreme care, and its uprights, formed of the twisted fibers of a species of cane, had the strength of a thick cable.As to the rounds, they were made of a sort of red cedar, with light, strong branches; and this apparatus was wrought by the masterly hand of Pencroft."
"其他绳子都是用植物纤维制成的，一架类似带滑轮起重机的装备被安装在门上。这样，就可以很容易地将砖头搬到花岗石宫中了。这样一来，建筑材料的运输就变得简单多了，内部的整修工作就可以马上开始了。他们不缺石灰，好几千块砖头也可以随时使用。隔间的基本构架很快呈现出来，起初很简陋，但是很快他们就按照当初达成一致的计划，将石洞分隔成了房间和仓库。","Other ropes were made with vegetable fibers, and a sort of crane with a tackle was fixed at the door.In this way bricks could easily be raised into Granite House.The transport of the materials being thus simplified, the arrangement of the interior could begin immediately.There was no want of lime, and some thousands of bricks were there ready to be used.The framework of the partitions was soon raised, very roughly at first, and in a short time, the cave was divided into rooms and storehouses, according to the plan agreed upon."
"工程师拿着锤子和铲子亲自上阵，在他的指挥下，不同的工作进展得很快。赛勒斯·哈丁什么工作都能做，为他聪明而热情的同伴们树立了一个好榜样。他们充满信心地工作着，甚至是兴高采烈地。潘克洛夫总讲引人大笑的笑话，他一会儿是木匠，一会儿是绳索工，有时又是泥瓦匠，同时把他良好的幽默感带给他们这个小世界的每个人。他对工程师极其信赖，什么也改变不了他的信任。他相信工程师有能力处理好任何事情，并且事事成功。衣服和鞋子确实是个极为重要的问题，除此之外，冬天数月的照明，如何利用岛上的丰富资源，栽培野生植物，这些问题对于赛勒斯·哈丁都显得简单，他认为所有这些问题都会适时地迎刃而解。他梦想着开几条水渠，来促进岛上富饶的物产运输，还要开采矿产，制造适应各种工业生产的机器，修铁路，不错，铁路！他相信总有一天林肯岛上会布满铁路网。","These different works progressed rapidly under the direction of the engineer, who himself handled the hammer and the trowel.No labor came amiss to Cyrus Harding, who thus set an example to his intelligent and zealous companions.They worked with confidence, even gaily, Pencroft always having some joke to crack, sometimes carpenter, sometimes rope-maker, sometimes mason, while he communicated his good humor to all the members of their little world.His faith in the engineer was complete; nothing could disturb it.He believed him capable of undertaking anything and succeeding in everything.The question of boots and clothes—assuredly a serious question,—that of light during the winter months, utilizing the fertile parts of the island, transforming the wild flora into cultivated flora, it all appeared easy to him; Cyrus Harding helping, everything would be done in time.He dreamed of canals facilitating the transport of the riches of the ground; workings of quarries and mines; machines for every industrial manufacture; railroads; yes, railroads!of which a network would certainly one day cover Lincoln Island."
"工程师让潘克洛夫说着。他并没有打击这位勇士的热切愿望。他知道信心是带有感染性的，他甚至一边听一边笑着，绝口不提他认为日后会遇到的困难。事实上，这个太平洋上的小岛处在航线以外，恐怕没人能帮到他们了。他们靠自己，也只能依靠自己的力量，因为林肯岛和任何一个岛屿都相距甚远，船里没有必要的上乘内部结构，乘船出海只会使他们处于危险境地，这是很严重的事情。","The engineer let Pencroft talk.He did not put down the aspirations of this brave heart.He knew how communicable confidence is; he even smiled to hear him speak, and said nothing of the uneasiness for the future which he felt.In fact, in that part of the Pacific, out of the course of vessels, it was to be feared that no help would ever come to them.It was on themselves, on themselves alone, that the settlers must depend, for the distance of Lincoln Island from all other land was such, that to hazard themselves in a boat, of a necessarily inferior construction, would be a serious and perilous thing."
"“但是，”就像水手说的，“鲁滨逊奇迹般地得到了一切，而我们却像是占了鲁滨逊的上风。”","“But,” as the sailor said, “they quite took the wind out of the sails of the Robinsons, for whom everything was done by a miracle.”"
"事实上，他们的精力都非常旺盛，只有精力充沛的人才能在这里活下来，懒汉在这里会无所事事，必死无疑。","In fact, they were energetic; an energetic man will succeed where an indolent one would vegetate and inevitably perish."
"赫伯特在这些工作中表现十分出色。他聪明又活泼，理解力强，而且干得好，赛勒斯·哈丁越来越喜欢这个少年了。赫伯特对工程师也怀有一种热烈、满怀尊敬的爱。潘克洛夫看到他们如此亲近的共鸣，没有一丝嫉妒。纳布还是纳布，他还是像以前那样勇敢、热心、忠诚、无私。他和潘克洛夫一样信赖工程师，只是表现得没有潘克洛夫那么强烈。每当水手兴高采烈的时候，纳布总是像在说：“这有什么好稀奇的。”潘克洛夫和他是十分要好的朋友。","Herbert distinguished himself in these works.He was intelligent and active; understanding quickly, he performed well; and Cyrus Harding became more and more attached to the boy.Herbert had a lively and reverent love for the engineer.Pencroft saw the close sympathy which existed between the two, but he was not in the least jealous.Neb was Neb: he was what he would be always, courage, zeal, devotion, self-denial personified.He had the same faith in his master that Pencroft had, but he showed it less vehemently.When the sailor was enthusiastic, Neb always looked as if he would say, “Nothing could be more natural.”Pencroft and he were great friends."
"吉丁·史佩莱在共同的工作中也分担了苦劳，而且干得一点不比同伴差，这一点让水手相当诧异。一个“新闻记者”，不但理解力强，做起事来也很出色。","As to Gideon Spilett, he took part in the common work, and was not less skilful in it than his companions, which always rather astonished the sailor.A “journalist,” clever, not only in understanding, but in performing everything."
"梯子终于在5月30号那天装妥了。在这个高达80英尺的垂梯上，至少有一百档梯阶。幸运的是，在离地面高达40英尺的峭壁上，有一处向外凸出的地方，这样哈丁能将梯子分为两部分。他们用镐仔细地将凸出的岩石凿成平台，然后把第一截梯子固定在这里，这样摇晃的程度就减少了一半，还可以用一根绳子将软梯升到和花岗石宫同等高度。第二段梯子有了双重保障，它的下端系在突出的地方，上端系在石宫的门上。总之，现在上去容易多了。另外，赛勒斯·哈丁打算稍后再安装一台水力机械，这能为花岗石宫的居民避免所有的劳累和时间的损失。","The ladder was finally fixed on the 28th of May.There were not less than a hundred rounds in this perpendicular height of eighty feet.Harding had been able, fortunately, to divide it in two parts, profiting by an overhanging of the cliff which made a projection forty feet above the ground.This projection, carefully leveled by the pickaxe, made a sort of platform, to which they fixed the first ladder, of which the oscillation was thus diminished one-half, and a rope permitted it to be raised to the level of Granite House.As to the second ladder, it was secured both at its lower part, which rested on the projection, and at its upper end, which was fastened to the door.In short the ascent had been made much easier.Besides, Cyrus Harding hoped later to establish an hydraulic apparatus, which would avoid all fatigue and loss of time, for the inhabitants of Granite House."
"居民们很快就习惯了使用梯子。他们矫健敏捷，而潘克洛夫作为水手，对攀爬桅杆和支索驾轻就熟，可以给他们上堂课了。给托普上课也是必须的。可怜的托普，它的四个爪子，不是用来做这种运动的。但是，潘克洛夫是个热心的教导者，托普最后也能正确地爬梯子了，不久之后，它可以容易地爬上梯子，简直可以与马戏团的同类相媲美了。不用说，水手对他学生的表现感到骄傲。然而，潘克洛夫不只一次在后面举着托普，托普从来也没有抱怨。","The settlers soon became habituated to the use of this ladder.They were light and active, and Pencroft, as a sailor, accustomed to run up the masts and shrouds, was able to give them lessons.But it was also necessary to give them to Top.The poor dog, with his four paws, was not formed for this sort of exercise.But Pencroft was such a zealous master, that Top ended by properly performing his ascents, and soon mounted the ladder as readily as his brethren in the circus.It need not be said that the sailor was proud of his pupil.However, more than once Pencroft hoisted him on his back, which Top never complained of."
"这里必须说明的是，随着寒冷季节的到来，在上述工作进行得热火朝天的时候，大家也没有忽视食物供应问题。每天，记者和赫伯特被指派为开拓地的食物供应者，他们俩每天都要抽出几个钟头来打猎。到目前为止，他们还只是在啄木鸟林及河的左岸捕猎，因为没有桥和船只，他们还从来没渡过慈悲河。他们还从来没探索过被称为远西森林的那片广阔无边的丛林。这场重要的短途探索活动留到明年开春之后，天气一转暖就进行。但是啄木鸟树林是一个鸟兽群聚的地方，这里有的是袋鼠和野猪，有铁头矛、弓箭的猎人们战果累累。此外，赫伯特还在泻湖的西南边发现了一个天然的养兔场，这是一片有点湿的草地，到处都是杨柳和各种香草，空气中香气逼人，这里有百里香、罗勒、香薄荷，以及各种唇形科芳香植物，这些似乎都是兔子特别爱吃的植物。","It must be mentioned here, that during these works, which were actively conducted, for the bad season was approaching, the alimentary question was not neglected.Every day, the reporter and Herbert, who had been voted purveyors to the colony, devoted some hours to the chase.As yet, they only hunted in Jacamar Wood, on the left of the river, because, for want of a bridge or boat, the Mercy had not yet been crossed.All the immense woods, to which the name of the Forests of the Far West had been given, were not explored.They reserved this important excursion for the first fine days of the next spring.But Jacamar Wood was full of game; kangaroos and boars abounded, and the hunters iron-tipped spears and bows and arrows did wonders.Besides, Herbert discovered towards the southwest point of the lagoon a natural warren, a slightly damp meadow, covered with willows and aromatic herbs which scented the air, such as thyme, basil, savory, all the sweet-scented species of the labiated plants, which the rabbits appeared to be particularly fond of."
"记者认为，这片草地既然是为兔子准备的，如果没有兔子未免有些奇怪，于是两个猎人就开始仔细地搜寻起来。不管怎样，这片草地有用的草木众多，为博物学家研究这个植物王国的许多样本提供了一个得天独厚的机会。赫伯特搜集了几把罗勒、迷迭香、薄荷、霍香等植物的嫩芽，它们各有各的药用价值，有的可以治肺病，有的可以止血，有的可以退烧，有的可以治痉挛和风湿。之后，潘克洛夫问收集这些草有什么用。","On the reporter observing that since the table was spread for the rabbits, it was strange that the rabbits themselves should be wanting, the two sportsmen carefully explored the warren.At any rate, it produced an abundance of useful plants, and a naturalist would have had a good opportunity of studying many specimens of the vegetable kingdom.Herbert gathered several shoots of the basil, rosemary, balm, betony, etc., which possess different medicinal properties, some pectoral, astringent, febrifuge, others anti-spasmodic, or anti-rheumatic.When, afterwards, Pencroft asked the use of this collection of herbs,—"
"“药用，”少年答道，“我们生病时，可以用来治病。”","“For medicine,” replied the lad, “to treat us when we are ill.”"
"“我们为什么会生病呢？岛上也没有医生。”潘克洛夫一本正经地回答道。","“Why should we be ill, since there are no doctors in the island?” asked Pencroft quite seriously."
"少年没有回答这个问题，他继续收集草药。到了花岗石宫后，大家对这件事都很赞同。除了那些香草之外，少年还带回了一种在北美称为“大红香锋草”的植物，用它泡制的饮料十分可口。","There was no reply to be made to that, but the lad went on with his collection all the same, and it was well received at Granite House.Besides these medicinal herbs, he added a plant known in North America as “Oswego tea,” which made an excellent beverage."
"最后，经过彻底的搜查，猎人们终于到达真正的养兔场了。这里满地都是窟窿，像过滤网一样。","At last, by searching thoroughly, the hunters arrived at the real site of the warren.There the ground was perforated like a sieve."
"“这里有兔子窝！”赫伯特喊起来。","“Here are the burrows!” cried Herbert."
"“是的，”记者答道，“我看见了。”","“Yes,” replied the reporter, “so I see.”"
"“可是里面住着兔子吗？”","“But are they inhabited?”"
"“这可说不准。”","“That is the question.”"
"这个问题马上就得到解答了。瞬间，上百只类似兔子的小动物向四面八方逃去，他们跑得很快，连托普都追不上。猎人们和托普追赶了一阵，徒劳无果，这些啮齿动物逃得太迅速了。但是记者决定不离开，起码要逮住六只四足动物才会离开。他打算先充实他们的食品室，以后有时间再捉来驯养。想捉住它们本不困难，只要在洞口布几个陷阱就行了。可是，眼下他们没有陷阱，也没有制造陷阱的材料。因此，他们必须到每个洞里去搜寻，用棍子伸进洞中翻找，既然没有别的方法，他们就只能靠耐心了。","This was soon answered.Almost immediately, hundreds of little animals, similar to rabbits, fled in every direction, with such rapidity that even Top could not overtake them.Hunters and dog ran in vain; these rodents escaped them easily.But the reporter resolved not to leave the place, until he had captured at least half-a-dozen of the quadrupeds.He wished to stock their larder first, and domesticate those which they might take later.It would not have been difficult to do this, with a few snares stretched at the openings of the burrows.But at this moment they had neither snares, nor anything to make them of.They must, therefore, be satisfied with visiting each hole, and rummaging in it with a stick, hoping by dint of patience to do what could not be done in any other way."
"半个钟头之后，他们终于在洞里捉住了四只兔子。这种啮齿动物与他们的欧洲同类差不多，一般被称为美洲兔。","At last, after half an hour, four rodents were taken in their holes.They were similar to their European brethren, and are commonly known by the name of American rabbits."
"他们把打猎的战果带回花岗石宫，打算当作晚餐。谁都没有瞧不起养兔场的住客，它们的味道好极了。这是开拓地的一笔宝贵的财富，并且看起来取之不尽。","This produce of the chase was brought back to Granite House, and figured at the evening repast.The tenants of the warren were not at all to be despised, for they were delicious.It was a valuable resource of the colony, and it appeared to be inexhaustible."
"到5月31号，隔间的工作全部结束了。房间里就只差添设家具了，这将是在漫长的冬日的工作。他们将第一间房作为厨房，里面砌了一个烟囱。这些业余的砌砖工被排烟管道的制作难住了。在哈丁看来，最简单的方法就是用制砖粘土来砌。因为烟囱在上面的高地开一个出口是根本不可能的，于是他们就在厨房窗户上方的花岗岩上开了一个洞，烟囱从洞中通过去就像铁炉的铁管一样。也许迎面吹来的风会使烟囱倒烟，但是迎面吹来的风毕竟很少，此外，大师哈丁、纳布和炊事员对这一点也不会太挑剔。","On the 31st of May the partitions were finished.The rooms had now only to be furnished, and this would be work for the long winter days.A chimney was established in the first room, which served as a kitchen.The pipe destined to conduct the smoke outside gave some trouble to these amateur bricklayers.It appeared simplest to Harding to make it of brick clay; as creating an outlet for it to the upper plateau was not to be thought of, a hole was pierced in the granite above the window of the kitchen, and the pipe met it like that of an iron stove.Perhaps the winds which blew directly against the facade would make the chimney smoke, but these winds were rare, and besides, Master Neb, the cook, was not so very particular about that."
"当内部布置完成之后，工程师又忙着堵住湖水原来的出口，将这条通向石宫的道路完全断开。他们将大石块滚到出口出，又将它们牢牢地砌在一起。赛勒斯·哈丁还没有实现通过筑坝恢复湖水水位，从而淹没湖水出口的计划。堵住出口的岩石上长着草和灌木，来年春天，这些草木会长得更密，他对于用草和灌木遮盖堵塞物的办法很满意。另外，他还从瀑布中引了一条淡水到新居中。只要在他们的平面以下开凿一条小沟就可以了，这个水源十分清澈，而且取之不尽，每天的引水量可以达到25到30加仑。花岗石宫中再也不会缺水了。现在，一切都已经安排就绪，坏天气马上就要来了。正面的窗口先安上了厚厚的百叶窗，只等着工程师抽空制造玻璃了。","When these interior arrangements were finished, the engineer occupied himself in blocking up the outlet by the lake, so as to prevent any access by that way.Masses of rock were rolled to the entrance and strongly cemented together.Cyrus Harding did not yet realize his plan of drowning this opening under the waters of the lake, by restoring them to their former level by means of a dam.He contented himself with hiding the obstruction with grass and shrubs, which were planted in the interstices of the rocks, and which next spring would sprout thickly.However, he used the waterfall so as to lead a small stream of fresh water to the new dwelling.A little trench, made below their level, produced this result; and this derivation from a pure and inexhaustible source yielded twenty-five or thirty gallons a day.There would never be any want of water at Granite House.At last all was finished, and it was time, for the bad season was near.Thick shutters closed the windows of the facade, until the engineer had time to make glass."
"在窗户四周的突出岩石上，长有各种植被，吉丁·史佩莱将这些植被修整得非常有艺术性，在窗的四周还有一条展开的、长长的青草，窗框在如诗如画的绿色的掩映中，非常赏心悦目。","Gideon Spilett had very artistically arranged on the rocky projections around the windows plants of different kinds, as well as long streaming grass, so that the openings were picturesquely framed in green, which had a pleasing effect."
"住在这幢结实、舒适又安全的居所里，居民们都不禁心醉于自己的工作成果。从窗户望出去，延伸的是一望无际的风景，北边尽头是颚角，南边是爪角。联合湾的风景尽在他们面前。是的，这些勇敢的居民的确有理由感到满意，潘克洛夫更是毫不吝啬对石宫的溢美之词，他诙谐地称它为“地上的第五层公寓”！","The inhabitants of this solid, healthy, and secure dwelling, could not but be charmed with their work.The view from the windows extended over a boundless horizon, which was closed by the two Mandible Capes on the north, and Claw Cape on the south.All Union Bay was spread before them.Yes, our brave settlers had reason to be satisfied, and Pencroft was lavish in his praise of what he humorously called, “his apartments on the fifth floor above the ground!”"
"第二十章","Chapter 20"
"从六月份开始就进入冬季了，相当于北半球的十二月份。入冬以来，不是狂风就是暴雨，一个接一个，没有间断。花岗石宫的居民们可以感激这个居所的好处了，它使他们避过了恶劣的天气。石窟却不能使他们免受严酷天气的侵袭，并且汹涌的潮水还有可能再灌进来，这很可怕。赛勒斯·哈丁早就采取措施提防这种意外的发生，来保护安置在那里的锻铁炉和熔炉。","The winter season set in with the month of June, which corresponds with the month of December in the Northern Hemisphere.It began with showers and squalls, which succeeded each other without intermission.The tenants of Granite House could appreciate the advantages of a dwelling which sheltered them from the inclement weather.The Chimneys would have been quite insufficient to protect them against the rigor of winter, and it was to be feared that the high tides would make another irruption.Cyrus Harding had taken precautions against this contingency, so as to preserve as much as possible the forge and furnace which were established there."
"整个六月份，他们都在忙着各种工作，打猎和捕鱼也在其中，因此，食品室中储存了充足的食物。潘克洛夫一闲下来，就提议设一些陷阱，他对收获抱有很大的期望。他很快就用爬藤制作了一些圈套，在陷阱的帮助下，养兔场从此每天都向他们供应一定数量的啮齿动物。纳布几乎把所有时间都用在腌制和熏制肉类上了，以保证大家总是有大量的食品储备。现在他们严肃地讨论衣服的问题，大家除了从气球上掉下来时穿的那身衣服之外，就什么也没有了。这些衣服都很暖和，也很结实，他们一直非常仔细地保护着衣服，还有他们的亚麻布，因此，所有人的衣服都完好无缺，但是他们很快需要换掉衣服。此外，如果这个冬天十分寒冷，居民们会遭受巨大的严寒之苦。","During the whole of the month of June the time was employed in different occupations, which excluded neither hunting nor fishing, the larder being, therefore, abundantly supplied.Pencroft, so soon as he had leisure, proposed to set some traps, from which he expected great results.He soon made some snares with creepers, by the aid of which the warren henceforth every day furnished its quota of rodents.Neb employed nearly all his time in salting or smoking meat, which insured their always having plenty of provisions.The question of clothes was now seriously discussed, the settlers having no other garments than those they wore when the balloon threw them on the island.These clothes were warm and good; they had taken great care of them as well as of their linen, and they were perfectly whole, but they would soon need to be replaced.Moreover, if the winter was severe, the settlers would suffer greatly from cold."
"机智的哈丁在这个问题上却犯了难。他们必须先把最迫切的问题解决，安置好住处，储存足够的食物。这样一来，可能衣服的问题还没解决，天气就转冷了。因此，他们必须下定决心不添衣服，度过第一个冬天了。当天气又变好一些的时候，他们就定期捕猎摩弗伦羊。他们上次去富兰克林山探险的时候，曾经见到过这种羊。一旦羊毛收集好了，工程师就会知道如何用它来织成既暖和又结实的衣料了。怎么织呢？他会考虑这个问题。","On this subject the ingenuity of Harding was at fault.They must provide for their most pressing wants, settle their dwelling, and lay in a store of food; thus the cold might come upon them before the question of clothes had been settled.They must therefore make up their minds to pass this first winter without additional clothing.When the fine season came round again, they would regularly hunt those musmons which had been seen on the expedition to Mount Franklin, and the wool once collected, the engineer would know how to make it into strong warm stuff....How?He would consider."
"“好吧，我们就在花岗石宫里尽量烤我们自己吧！”潘克洛夫说道，“这里有成堆的燃料，没理由留着。”","“Well, we are free to roast ourselves at Granite House!” said Pencroft.“There are heaps of fuel, and no reason for sparing it.”"
"“而且，”吉丁·史佩莱补充道，“林肯岛又不是处在纬度很高的地方，冬天可能不会太冷。赛勒斯，你不是说过这里的南纬35度相当于北半球的西班牙吗？”","“Besides,” added Gideon Spilett, “Lincoln Island is not situated under a very high latitude, and probably the winters here are not severe.Did you not say, Cyrus, that this thirty-fifth parallel corresponded to that of Spain in the other hemisphere?”"
"“那是一定的，”工程师答道，“但是有时候，西班牙的冬天也非常冷！冰雪一样也不少，也许林肯岛的天气也会如此严酷。然而，这是一个海岛，所以，我希望这里的天气能温和一些。”","“Doubtless,” replied the engineer, “but some winters in Spain are very cold!No want of snow and ice; and perhaps Lincoln Island is just as rigourously tried.However, it is an island, and as such, I hope that the temperature will be more moderate.”"
"“为什么呢，上尉？”赫伯特问道。","“Why, captain?” asked Herbert."
"“孩子，因为海洋就好比一个巨大的水库，把夏天的热量都储存在里面。当冬天来临的时候，大海就会释放这些热量，确保沿海地区的温度适中，夏天没那么热，冬天没那么冷。”","“Because the sea, my boy, may be considered as an immense reservoir, in which is stored the heat of the summer.When winter comes, it restores this heat, which insures for the regions near the ocean a medium temperature, less high in summer, but less low in winter.”"
"“到时候就知道了，”潘克洛夫答道，“但是我不想考虑到底冷不冷的问题。有一点是肯定的，那就是白天已经变短了，夜晚变长了。我们谈谈照明的问题吧。”","“We shall prove that,” replied Pencroft.“But I don’t want to bother myself about whether it will be cold or not.One thing is certain, that is that the days are already short, and the evenings long.Suppose we talk about the question of light.”"
"“这个最容易了。”哈丁回答道。","“Nothing is easier,” replied Harding."
"“怎么说？”水手问道。","“To talk about?” asked the sailor."
"“容易解决。”","“To settle.”"
"“我们什么时候开始干？”","“And when shall we begin?”"
"“就从明天开始，从打海豹开始。”","“To-morrow, by having a seal hunt.”"
"“用来制作蜡烛吗？”","“To make candles?”"
"“是的。”","“Yes.”"
"这就是工程师的计划，而且这个计划完全可行。因为他有石灰和硫酸，而小岛上的两栖动物又可以为他们制造蜡烛提供必要的脂肪。","Such was the engineer’s project; and it was quite feasible, since he had lime and sulphuric acid, while the amphibians of the islet would furnish the fat necessary for the manufacture."
"现在是6月4号了。这一天正是圣灵降临节，他们统一庆祝节日。他们停下了所有的工作，向神献上祷告。现在祷告已经变成了感恩。林肯岛上的居民们已经不再是被抛弃在小岛上的落难者了。他们别无所求，心中充满了感恩。第二天是6月5号，天气有些变化无常，但他们还是出发到小岛上去了。他们必须借着退潮跨过海峡，大家就决定尽其所能，为了渡过海峡造一条小船，使往来更方便，将来去海岛西南部进行大规模探险的时候，也能使他们沿着慈悲河上游航行——等天气一转好他们就去。","They were now at the 4th of June.It was Whit Sunday and they agreed to observe this feast.All work was suspended, and prayers were offered to Heaven.But these prayers were now thanksgivings.The settlers in Lincoln Island were no longer the miserable castaways thrown on the islet.They asked for nothing more—they gave thanks.The next day, the 5th of June, in rather uncertain weather, they set out for the islet.They had to profit by the low tide to cross the Channel, and it was agreed that they would construct, for this purpose, as well as they could, a boat which would render communication so much easier, and would also permit them to ascend the Mercy, at the time of their grand exploration of the southwest of the island, which was put off till the first fine days."
"海豹的数目很多，猎人带着铁头矛，毫不费力就刺死了六只。纳布和潘克洛夫剥下海豹皮，只把皮和脂肪带回花岗石宫，海豹皮是留着做皮靴用的。","The seals were numerous, and the hunters, armed with their iron-tipped spears, easily killed half-a-dozen.Neb and Pencroft skinned them, and only brought back to Granite House their fat and skin, this skin being intended for the manufacture of boots."
"打猎的结果是得到了将近300磅的脂肪，所有这些都会用来制造蜡烛。","The result of the hunt was this: nearly three hundred pounds of fat, all to be employed in the fabrication of candles."
"蜡烛的制造过程非常简单，即使不能得到绝对完美的结果，至少会很有用。赛勒斯·哈丁现在只有硫酸，但是把硫酸和中性的脂肪放在一起加热，就可以分离出甘油来。然后，他又用把沸水加入其中，从这种新的化合物中分离出了油脂、人造奶油和硬脂。为了简化工序，他更愿意先用石灰把脂肪皂化。这样他就得到一种石灰质的肥皂，这种肥皂很容易被硫酸分解，将其中的石灰沉淀为硫酸盐，使脂酸脱离出来。","The operation was extremely simple, and if it did not yield absolutely perfect results, they were at least very useful.Cyrus Harding would only have had at his disposal sulphuric acid, but by heating this acid with the neutral fatty bodies he could separate the glycerine; then from this new combination, he easily separated the olein, the margarin, and the stearin, by employing boiling water.But to simplify the operation, he preferred to saponify the fat by means of lime.By this he obtained a calcareous soap, easy to decompose by sulphuric acid, which precipitated the lime into the state of sulphate, and liberated the fatty acids."
"在油酸、珠光脂酸和硬脂酸这三种酸中，第一种酸是液体，只要施加足够的压力，就可以将它排出去。其余两种酸正是制造蜡烛的原料。","From these three acids-oleic, margaric, and stearic-the first, being liquid, was driven out by a sufficient pressure.As to the two others, they formed the very substance of which the candles were to be molded."
"这项工作只花费了不到24个小时。做了几次实验之后，他们最终采用植物纤维来制作蜡烛芯，再将蜡烛芯浸入到融化的蜡油中，用手捏成形，就制作出了普通的硬脂蜡烛了，唯一欠缺的就是颜色不够白，没有光泽。蜡烛芯在硼酸中浸过，蜡烛燃烧时硼酸会玻璃化，并且随着蜡烛燃烧殆尽。他们不知道怎么利用硼酸的这个特性，但是赛勒斯·哈丁已经做好一把漂亮的熄烛剪刀，在花岗石宫的漫漫长夜中，这些蜡烛必将为大家带来极大的方便。","This operation did not last more than four and twenty hours.The wicks, after several trials, were made of vegetable fibers, and dipped in the liquefied substance, they formed regular stearic candles, molded by the hand, which only wanted whiteness and polish.They would not doubtless have the advantages of the wicks which are impregnated with boracic acid, and which vitrify as they burn and are entirely consumed, but Cyrus Harding having manufactured a beautiful pair of snuffers, these candles would be greatly appreciated during the long evenings in Granite House."
"在这一个月期间，新居的内部还有很多事情。木匠有很多活干。他们将粗糙的工具改进了，又新制作了一些工具。","During this month there was no want of work in the interior of their new dwelling.The joiners had plenty to do.They improved their tools, which were very rough, and added others also."
"其中就有剪刀，现在居民们终于可以剪发了，也能剃胡子了，至少可以修理一下胡须。除了赫伯特没有胡子，纳布只有一丁点胡须之外，其他的人都已经是满脸胡茬了，这个剪刀做得太对了。","Scissors were made among other things, and the settlers were at last able to cut their hair, and also to shave, or at least trim their beards.Herbert had none, Neb but little, but their companions were bristling in a way which justified the making of the said scissors."
"制作一个手锯非常麻烦，但最后还是做成了，只要用的时候多用力，就可以将木头纤维锯开。然后他们又为主要房间制作了桌椅和碗橱，还有床架，所有的寝具都由草垫做成。厨房的搁架上摆放着各种炊具，砖炉看起来也很棒。纳布一直在那儿干活，那股认真劲让人感觉他仿佛置身于化学家的实验室。","The manufacture of a hand-saw cost infinite trouble, but at last an instrument was obtained which, when vigorously handled, could divide the ligneous fibers of the wood.They then made tables, seats, cupboards, to furnish the principal rooms, and bedsteads, of which all the bedding consisted of grass mattresses.The kitchen, with its shelves, on which rested the cooking utensils, its brick stove, looked very well, and Neb worked away there as earnestly as if he was in a chemist’s laboratory."
"但是，工匠们立马又变成了木匠。事实上，爆炸产生的瀑布又使建两座桥变得很有必要，一座要建在眺望岗上，一座要建在岸边。现在，高地和岸边被一条水道横向隔开了，要去小岛的北部必须要跨过这条水道。为避免这种情况，拓荒者们就必须爬上红河的源头绕道而行，这是一段很长的路。最简单的解决办法就是在高地和岸边分别搭建一座桥，长度为20到25英尺。木匠们要做的就是砍掉一些树木的树枝，这项工作需要时日。桥很快就搭好了，有了桥，纳布和潘克洛夫就到他们上次在丘陵附近发现的牡蛎场去了。这次他们拖了一辆做工粗糙的手推车，代替了之前不方便的筐子，拉回了好几千个牡蛎回来，这些牡蛎在慈悲河的岩石间迅速繁殖开来，在河口形成了一个牡蛎场。这种软体动物非常美味，拓荒者们每天都享用一些。","But the joiners had soon to be replaced by carpenters.In fact, the waterfall created by the explosion rendered the construction of two bridges necessary, one on Prospect Heights, the other on the shore.Now the plateau and the shore were transversely divided by a watercourse, which had to be crossed to reach the northern part of the island.To avoid it the colonists had been obliged to make a considerable detour, by climbing up to the source of the Red Creek.The simplest thing was to establish on the plateau, and on the shore, two bridges from twenty to five and twenty feet in length.All the carpenter’s work that was needed was to clear some trees of their branches: this was a business of some days.Directly the bridges were established, Neb and Pencroft profited by them to go to the oyster-bed which had been discovered near the downs.They dragged with them a sort of rough cart, which replaced the former inconvenient hurdle, and brought back some thousands of oysters, which soon increased among the rocks and formed a bed at the mouth of the Mercy.These molluscs were of excellent quality, and the colonists consumed some daily."
"看得出来，尽管居民们只是探索了林肯岛的一小部分，但所得已经几乎可以满足他们所有的需要了。如果他们深入到岛上最隐秘的区域打猎，也就是慈悲河和爬虫角之间所有的森林地带，他们可能会发现新的宝贝。","It has been seen that Lincoln Island, although its inhabitants had as yet only explored a small portion of it, already contributed to almost all their wants.It was probable that if they hunted into its most secret recesses, in all the wooded part between the Mercy and Reptile Point, they would find new treasures."
"林肯岛上的居民还缺少一样东西。他们不缺少肉食，也不缺乏蔬菜产品。他们发现一种木根在发酵之后，能生成酸味饮料，口感比凉水要好。没有甘蔗和甜菜，他们收集“酿母枫”中蒸馏出的液体，做成糖。“酿母枫”是枫树的一种，生长在全球温带地区，这个海岛上也有许多。他们从养兔场采来香草，做成了可口的茶。最后，他们还有很多盐，这是食物中的唯一矿物质，但是他们没有面包。","The settlers in Lincoln Island had still one privation.There was no want of meat, nor of vegetable products; those ligneous roots which they had found, when subjected to fermentation, gave them an acid drink, which was preferable to cold water; they also made sugar, without canes or beet-roots, by collecting the liquor which distils from the “acer saceharinum,” a son of maple-tree, which flourishes in all the temperate zones, and of which the island possessed a great number; they made a very agreeable tea by employing the herbs brought from the warren; lastly, they had an abundance of salt, the only mineral which is used in food...but bread was wanting."
"也许居民们会适时地找到可以代替面包的食物，他们可能会在南部的森林里找到西米树或面包树，但是他们到现在为止还没有遇见这些珍贵的树木。然而，上天很快就垂青了他们。尽管上天所赐的东西极其渺小，但是对塞勒斯·哈丁来说，即使用尽他的全部智慧和创造力，也不可能创造出来。他们撞了大运，一天，赫伯特在整理他的背心时，意外地在内衬里有了发现。","Perhaps in time the settlers could replace this want by some equivalent, it was possible that they might find the sago or the breadfruit tree among the forests of the south, but they had not as yet met with these precious trees.However, Providence came directly to their aid, in an infinitesimal proportion it is true, but Cyrus Harding, with all his intelligence, all his ingenuity, would never have been able to produce that which, by the greatest chance, Herbert one day found in the lining of his waistcoat, which he was occupied in setting to rights."
"这一天，外面下着倾盆大雨，居民们都聚在花岗石宫的大厅里，少年突然间大喊起来：","On this day, as it was raining in torrents, the settlers were assembled in the great hall in Granite House, when the lad cried out all at once,—"
"“看这里，上尉——一个谷粒！”","“Look here, captain—A grain of corn!”"
"于是，他把这颗谷粒——独一无二的谷粒给同伴们看，这是从他口袋的窟窿里掉进背心的内衬里的。","And he showed his companions a grain—a single grain—which from a hole in his pocket had got into the lining of his waistcoat."
"这颗谷粒的出现是这样的：在里士满的时候，潘克洛夫送给赫伯特几只鸽子，谷粒就是他曾用来喂鸽子的。","The presence of this grain was explained by the fact that Herbert, when at Richmond, used to feed some pigeons, of which Pencroft had made him a present."
"“一颗谷粒？”工程师马上问道。","“A grain of corn?” said the engineer quickly."
"“是的，上尉，但是就一粒，只有一粒！”","“Yes, captain; but one, only one!”"
"“好吧，孩子，”潘克洛夫笑着说，“真像我说的，我们真是幸运啊！我们能用一粒谷粒做什么呢？”","“Well, my boy,” said Pencroft, laughing, “we’re getting on capitally, upon my word!What shall we make with one grain of corn?”"
"“可以用来做面包。”赛勒斯·哈丁答道。","“We will make bread of it,” replied Cyrus Harding."
"“面包，蛋糕，果馅饼！”水手应道,“嗨，这粒种子做成的面包不会马上噎着我们的！”","“Bread, cakes, tarts!” replied the sailor.“Come, the bread that this grain of corn will make won’t choke us very soon!”"
"赫伯特觉得这个发现没多大意义，正考虑把种子扔掉。但是哈丁把种子接过来，仔细看了看，发现种子完好无缺，于是就转过来，正对着水手的脸，平静地问：“潘克洛夫，你知道一个谷粒可以结多少穗子吗？”","Herbert, not attaching much importance to his discovery, was going to throw away the grain in question; but Harding took it, examined it, found that it was in good condition, and looking the sailor full in the face—“Pencroft,” he asked quietly, “do you know how many ears one grain of corn can produce?”"
"“我想也就一个吧！”水手答道，他对哈丁的这个问题感到惊讶。","“One, I suppose!” replied the sailor, surprised at the question."
"“十个，潘克洛夫！那你知道一个穗子能结多少粒玉米吗？”","“Ten, Pencroft!And do you know how many grains one ear bears?”"
"“这个我可不知道。”","“No, upon my word.”"
"“大约80粒！”赛勒斯·哈丁说道，“那么，如果我们种下这粒种子，第一批收成就是800粒玉米，第二批收成就变成64万粒了，到第三次可以收获5.12亿粒，第四次的收获可以超过4000亿粒！比例就是这样。”","“About eighty!” said Cyrus Harding.“Then, if we plant this grain, at the first crop we shall reap eight hundred grains which at the second will produce six hundred and forty thousand; at the third, five hundred and twelve millions; at the fourth, more than four hundred thousands of millions!There is the proportion.”"
"哈丁的同伴们默默地听着。这些数字让他们吃惊。但是，数字是准确的。","Harding’s companions listened without answering.These numbers astonished them.They were exact, however."
"“是的，朋友们，”工程师继续说道，“这就是多产的数列，但是一粒谷粒的穗子只能结800粒谷粒，而一粒罂粟种子能结3.2粒，烟草能结36万粒种子。相比之下，谷粒又算得了什么呢？仅仅几年时间，如果没有那些数不清的破坏因素遏制它们的繁殖力，这些作物就会在地球泛滥成灾了。”","“Yes, my friends,” continued the engineer, “such are the arithmetical progressions of prolific nature; and yet what is this multiplication of the grain of corn, of which the ear only bears eight hundred grains, compared to the poppy-plant, which bears thirty-two thousand seeds; to the tobacco-plant, which produces three hundred and sixty thousand?In a few years, without the numerous causes of destruction, which arrests their fecundity, these plants would overrun the earth.”"
"工程师的训导没有到此结束。","But the engineer had not finished his lecture."
"“现在，潘克洛夫，”他继续说道，“你知道4000亿粒谷粒相当于多少蒲式耳吗？”","“And now, Pencroft,” he continued, “do you know how many bushels four hundred thousand millions of grains would make?”"
"“不知道，”水手答道，“我现在只知道我和一个白痴没什么两样！”","“No,” replied the sailor; “but what I do know is, that I am nothing better than a fool!”"
"“好吧，潘克洛夫，按一蒲式耳约合13万粒谷粒来算。”","“Well, they would make more than three millions, at a hundred and thirty thousand a bushel, Pencroft.”"
"“300万啊！”潘克洛夫叫起来。","“Three millions!” cried Pencroft."
"“300万。”","“Three millions.”"
"“短短四年？”","“In four years?”"
"“是的，”赛勒斯·哈丁答道，“甚至两年就可以，根据这里的纬度，我想每年可以有两次收成。”","“In four years,” replied Cyrus Harding, “and even in two years, if, as I hope, in this latitude we can obtain two crops a year.”"
"听到这些，根据他平常的习惯，潘克洛夫没有应答，而是禁不住欢呼雀跃起来。","At that, according to his usual custom, Pencroft could not reply otherwise than by a tremendous hurrah."
"“所以，赫伯特，”工程师补充道，“你的发现对大家来说十分重要。每件东西，我的朋友们，对于我们现在的处境来说，都会是有用的。我请求大家不要忘记这一点。”","“So, Herbert,” added the engineer, “you have made a discovery of great importance to us.Everything, my friends, everything can serve us in the condition in which we are.Do not forget that, I beg of you.”"
"“不，上尉，我们绝不会忘记这一点的，”潘克洛夫回答道，“假如我哪天发现了一粒能结36万粒种子的烟草籽，我向你保证，我是绝不会扔掉它的！那么现在，我们必须做什么呢？”","“No, captain, no, we shan’t forget it,” replied Pencroft; “and if ever I find one of those tobacco-seeds, which multiply by three hundred and sixty thousand, I assure you I won’t throw it away!And now, what must we do?”"
"“我们必须种下这粒种子。”赫伯特答道。","“We must plant this grain,” replied Herbert."
"“是的，”吉丁·史佩莱补充道，“要尽量小心，我们以后的收成全指望它。”","“Yes,” added Gideon Spilett, “and with every possible care, for it bears in itself our future harvests.”"
"“假如它真的长起来！”水手喊道。","“Provided it grows!” cried the sailor."
"“它会长起来的。”赛勒斯·哈丁回答道。","“It will grow,” replied Cyrus Harding."
"这一天是6月20号。现在播种这颗宝贵的谷粒正是时候。最初有人提议把它种在罐子里，但是大家经过深思熟虑之后，决定把它种在地里，任凭大自然去安排。他们当天就把它种上了，不用说，为了让试验功，他们每一步都很小心。","This was the 20th of June.The time was then propitious for sowing this single precious grain of corn.It was first proposed to plant it in a pot, but upon reflection it was decided to leave it to nature, and confide it to the earth.This was done that very day, and it is needless to add, that every precaution was taken that the experiment might succeed."
"雨过天晴，居民们爬上了花岗石宫上面的高地。在高地上，他们选了一处既避风又能晒到正午太阳的地方。他们打扫了地面，清除了杂草，找出了昆虫和蠕虫，又在地面上撒了一层石灰，就这样，一个优良的苗圃就做好了。苗圃的周围围上了栏杆，谷粒就埋在湿润的土壤中。","The weather having cleared, the settlers climbed the height above Granite House.There, on the plateau, they chose a spot, well sheltered from the wind, and exposed to all the heat of the midday sun.The place was cleared, carefully weeded, and searched for insects and worms; then a bed of good earth, improved with a little lime, was made; it was surrounded by a railing; and the grain was buried in the damp earth."
"居民们难道看起来不像是在为一所大厦奠定基石吗？潘克洛夫此时不禁回忆起他点燃唯一一只火柴的那一刻，以及当时的紧张心情。但是这一次更为重要。事实上，这些漂流者无论怎样，都可以再想方设法获取火源，但是如果不幸遗失了这粒谷粒，要想再找一粒就不是人力所能办到的了！","Did it not seem as if the settlers were laying the first stone of some edifice?It recalled to Pencroft the day on which he lighted his only match, and all the anxiety of the operation.But this time the thing was more serious.In fact, the castaways would have been always able to procure fire, in some mode or other, but no human power could supply another grain of corn, if unfortunately this should be lost!"
"第二十一章","Chapter 21"
"从此以后，潘克洛夫天天都要到他郑重地称为“麦田”的地方去一次。要是有什么昆虫敢到那里去，就是自找倒霉了！潘克洛夫对入侵者绝不姑息。","From this time Pencroft did not let a single day pass without going to visit what he gravely called his “corn-field.”And woe to the insects which dared to venture there!No mercy was shown them."
"将近6月底，阴雨连绵的天气过后，气温明显下降了，29号那天，气温仅在华氏20度左右，远远低于冰点。第二天是6月30号，是个星期五，这一天正相当于北半球的12月31号。纳布认为，这一年以一个坏天气告终了，但是潘克洛夫说这样更好，因为这预示着来年的第一天会是个好天气。","Towards the end of the month of June, after incessant rain, the weather became decidedly colder, and on the 29th a Fahrenheit thermometer would certainly have announced only twenty degrees above zero, that is considerably below the freezing-point.The next day, the 30th of June, the day which corresponds to the 31st of December in the northern year, was a Friday.Neb remarked that the year finished on a bad day, but Pencroft replied that naturally the next would begin on a good one, which was better."
"不管怎么样，新一年是以严寒开端的。就在慈悲河口慢慢结冰后不久，整个格兰特湖面都结冰了。","At any rate it commenced by very severe cold.Ice accumulated at the mouth of the Mercy, and it was not long before the whole expanse of the lake was frozen."
"居民们不得不频繁地补充木材储备。聪明的潘克洛夫没有等着河水封冻，他在之前就已经将许多庞大的木头运进了新居里。水流是一股永不疲倦的动力，在湖面封冻之前，他们一直利用流水运送木材。森林是他们充足的燃料来源，他们又从富兰克林支脉运回几车煤炭作为补充。煤炭产生的巨大热量在温度极低的天气里显得尤其可贵。6月4号，温度已经降低到华氏八摄氏度，也就是零下十三摄氏度。餐厅里建起了另一个火炉，大家坐在一起，做各自喜爱的事情。在这段寒冷的日子里，塞勒斯·哈丁着实为自己提前将来自格兰特湖的小水流引到花岗石宫而感到庆幸。从冰面下引出的湖水，从通道导过来，流得依然顺畅。水最后到达一个内部蓄水池，这是他们在储藏室的背面挖的，溢出的水会通过地下井流进大海里。","The settlers had frequently been obliged to renew their store of wood.Pencroft also had wisely not waited till the river was frozen, but had brought enormous rafts of wood to their destination.The current was an indefatigable moving power, and it was employed in conveying the floating wood to the moment when the frost enchained it.To the fuel which was so abundantly supplied by the forest, they added several cartloads of coal, which had to be brought from the foot of the spurs of Mount Franklin.The powerful heat of the coal was greatly appreciated in the low temperature, which on the 4th of July fell to eight degrees of Fahrenheit, that is, thirteen degrees below zero.A second fireplace had been established in the dining-room, where they all worked together at their different avocations.During this period of cold, Cyrus Harding had great cause to congratulate himself on having brought to Granite House the little stream of water from Lake Grant.Taken below the frozen surface, and conducted through the passage, it preserved its fluidity, and arrived at an interior reservoir which had been hollowed out at the back part of the storeroom, while the overflow ran through the well to the sea."
"这时候的天气极为干燥，拓荒者们只得尽量穿得暖和，他们决定留出一天时间，到慈悲河与爪角之间的小岛上去探险。那是一片广阔的沼泽地，也许他们会打到猎物，因为这里会聚集着很多水鸟。","About this time, the weather being extremely dry, the colonists, clothed as warmly as possible, resolved to devote a day to the exploration of that part of the island between the Mercy and Claw Cape.It was a wide extent of marshy land, and they would probably find good sport, for water-birds ought to swarm there."
"他们估计到那里有八九英里的路程，回来的距离也一样，所有来回需要一整天。他们这次要探索的是小岛上的未知领域，因此所有的拓荒者都参加这次探险。于是，6月5号早晨六点，刚刚破晓时分，赛勒斯·哈丁、史佩莱、赫伯特、纳布、潘克洛夫就带着矛、罗网、弓箭和食物，从花岗石宫出发了，托普一蹦一跳地走在大家前面。","They reckoned that it would be about eight or nine miles to go there, and as much to return, so that the whole of the day would be occupied.As an unknown part of the island was about to be explored, the whole colony took part in the expedition.Accordingly, on the 5th of July, at six o’clock in the morning, when day had scarcely broken, Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Neb, and Pencroft, armed with spears, snares, bows and arrows, and provided with provisions, left Granite House, preceded by Top, who bounded before them."
"最近的路是跨过覆盖慈悲河的冰面。","Their shortest way was to cross the Mercy on the ice, which then covered it."
"“但是，”就如工程师正确地观察到的，“这并不能代替一座普通的桥！”所以，建造一座桥就被列入以后的工作日程中了。","“But,” as the engineer justly observed, “that could not take the place of a regular bridge!”So, the construction of a regular bridge was noted in the list of future works."
"这是居民们第一次涉足慈悲河右岸，进入那些巨大、宏伟的松柏林中探险，现在这些树上零星分布着雪花。","It was the first time that the settlers had set foot on the right bank of the Mercy, and ventured into the midst of those gigantic and superb coniferae now sprinkled over with snow."
"但是他们走了还不到一英里时，在灌木丛中安家的一窝四足动物，因为受到托普的侵扰，往前面的空地冲出来。","But they had not gone half a mile when from a thicket a whole family of quadrupeds, who had made a home there, disturbed by Top, rushed forth into the open country."
"“啊！我看那像狐狸！”当赫伯特看着这一群飞快逃跑的动物，大喊道。","“Ah!I should say those are foxes!” cried Herbert, when he saw the troop rapidly decamping."
"这的确是一窝狐狸，只是体型很大，托普似乎对它们发出的吠声感到很惊讶，它在追赶途中停了一会儿，这些动作迅速的动物就乘机逃得无影无踪了。","They were foxes, but of a very large size, who uttered a sort of barking, at which Top seemed to be very much astonished, for he stopped short in the chase, and gave the swift animals time to disappear."
"狗不懂得博物学历史，难怪会吃惊。但这群狐狸的叫声、灰红的毛发，以及黑尾巴末尾的一撮白毛已经暴露了它们的身份。所以，赫伯特很快就给出了它们的真正名字“白狐”。这是在智利、福克兰群岛以及美国北纬30度到40度之间的地区里很常见的一种动物。让赫伯特遗憾的是，托普没逮住一只这种食肉动物。","The dog had reason to be surprised, as he did not know Natural History.But, by their barking, these foxes, with reddish-gray hair, black tails terminating in a white tuft, had betrayed their origin.So Herbert was able, without hesitating, to give them their real name of “Arctic foxes.”They are frequently met with in Chile, in the Falkland Islands, and in all parts of America traversed by the thirtieth and fortieth parallels.Herbert much regretted that Top had not been able to catch one of these carnivora."
"“白狐好吃吗？”潘克洛夫问道，他只从这一特点考虑岛上动物群的代表们。","“Are they good to eat?” asked Pencroft, who only regarded the representatives of the fauna in the island from one special point of view."
"“不好吃，”赫伯特答道，“动物学家现在也没搞清楚这种狐狸的眼睛是昼眼还是夜眼，也不知道是不是该把它们归入所谓的犬科。”","“No,” replied Herbert; “but zoologists have not yet found out if the eye of these foxes is diurnal or nocturnal, or whether it is correct to class them in the genus dog, properly so called.”"
"哈丁忍不住对少年的思考报以微笑，这显示出赫伯特善于思索。对于水手来说，自从知道这种狐狸不能归入好吃的一类，它们就成了无用之物。不过，哈丁认为，将来在花岗石宫修建好家禽场之后，最好采取措施来防范这些四脚食肉动物的突然造访，没有人对此表示异议。","Harding could not help smiling on hearing the lad’s reflection, which showed a thoughtful mind.As to the sailor, from the moment when he found that the foxes were not classed in the genus eatable, they were nothing to him.However, when a poultry-yard was established at Granite House, he observed that it would be best to take some precautions against a probable visit from these four-legged plunderers, and no one disputed this."
"绕过这一带之后，居民们看见一段长长的沙滩被海水冲刷着。这时候是早晨八点。天已经放晴了，持久的严寒过后往往会是晴朗的天气。但是，走了一段路之后，他们身上暖了，哈丁和同伴们都觉得天气不那么寒冷刺骨了。另外，因为这里没有风，虽冷也没那么叫人吃不消。一轮灿烂的旭日正从海平面上升起，但是没有带来丝毫暖意。海面上风平浪静，当天空放晴时，大海一片蔚蓝，就像地中海海湾一样。爪角弯曲得就像穆斯林弯刀，渐渐变细，向着东南方绵延大约四英里。在左边，沼泽边缘地带的尽头处是一个突出的小尖角。在联合湾的这个位置，有一点是确定无疑的，没有任何东西可以免于大海的侵袭，甚至是一片沙丘。如果有船只遭到东风的袭击，将无处躲避。这一片宁静的海，没有浅滩阻碍水的流动，颜色也是清一色的，没有沾上阴暗的黄色，这里甚至于没有礁石。他们通过这些判断出，沿岸一带海水就很深，水面以下就是万丈深渊。背后往西四英里的地方就是远西森林的边缘了。他们可以认为自己身处冰雪侵袭下的、南极岛屿的荒凉海岸。移民们在这停了下来，吃了早饭。他们用灌木和干海藻生了火，纳布准备的早餐是冻肉，他还沏了几杯大红香蜂草茶。","After having turned the point, the settlers saw a long beach washed by the open sea.It was then eight o’clock in the morning.The sky was very clear, as it often is after prolonged cold; but warmed by their walk, neither Harding nor his companions felt the sharpness of the atmosphere too severely.Besides there was no wind, which made it much more bearable.A brilliant sun, but without any calorific action, was just issuing from the ocean.The sea was as tranquil and blue as that of a Mediterranean gulf, when the sky is clear.Claw Cape, bent in the form of a yataghan, tapered away nearly four miles to the southeast.To the left the edge of the marsh was abruptly ended by a little point.Certainly, in this part of Union Bay, which nothing sheltered from the open sea, not even a sandbank, ships beaten by the east winds would have found no shelter.They perceived by the tranquillity of the sea, in which no shallows troubled the waters, by its uniform color, which was stained by no yellow shades, by the absence of even a reef, that the coast was steep and that the ocean there covered a deep abyss.Behind in the west, but at a distance of four miles, rose the first trees of the forests of the Far West.They might have believed themselves to be on the desolate coast of some island in the Antarctic regions which the ice had invaded.The colonists halted at this place for breakfast.A fire of brushwood and dried seaweed was lighted, and Neb prepared the breakfast of cold meat, to which he added some cups of Oswego tea."
"他们一边吃一边四处看着。林肯岛的这部分地区很贫瘠，与西部形成了对比。所以，记者由此观察到，如果当初命运把他们抛在这片海岸上，他们一定会认为将来这里的生活会很凄惨。","While eating they looked around them.This part of Lincoln Island was very sterile, and contrasted with all the western part.The reporter was thus led to observe that if chance had thrown them at first on the shore, they would have had but a deplorable idea of their future domain."
"“我认为要是掉在这里，我们是上不了岸的，”工程师回答道，“因为这里的海水很深，也没有可以攀附的礁石。而花岗石宫前面至少有几片沙洲，还有一个小岛，这就大大增加了我们生还的可能性。这里呢，什么也没有，只有万丈深渊！”","“I believe that we should not have been able to reach it,” replied the engineer, “for the sea is deep, and there is not a rock on which we could have taken refuge.Before Granite House, at least, there were sandbanks, an islet, which multiplied our chances of safety.Here, nothing but the depths!”"
"“这真是太罕见了，”史佩莱说道，“这么小的海岛竟然会有这么复杂的地理格局。按理说，这么复杂的地理条件只在一定范围的大陆上才会有。真可以这样说，林肯岛的西部地区物产富饶、土地肥沃，有墨西哥暖流经过，而北部和东南部海岸就像处于北极的海中。”","“It is singular enough,” remarked Spilett, “that this comparatively small island should present such varied ground.This diversity of aspect, logically only belongs to continents of a certain extent.One would really say, that the western part of Lincoln Island, so rich and so fertile, is washed by the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, and that its shores to the north and the southeast extend over a sort of Arctic sea.”"
"“你说得有道理，亲爱的史佩莱，”赛勒斯·哈丁回答道，“我也发现了这一点。我觉得这个小岛的形状和自然条件都很特别。它几乎涵盖了一块大陆所有的地理特征，如果说这以前是一块大陆，我一点也不奇怪。","“You are right, my dear Spilett,” replied Cyrus Harding, “I have also observed this.I think the form and also the nature of this island strange.It is a summary of all the aspects which a continent presents, and I should not be surprised if it was a continent formerly.”"
"“什么！太平洋中间的大陆？”潘克洛夫喊道。","“What! a continent in the middle of the Pacific?” cried Pencroft."
"“怎么不可能？”赛勒斯·哈丁回答道，“难道没有这种可能性吗？澳大利亚、新西兰、澳大拉西亚和太平洋上的列岛曾经连在一起，组成世界第六大洲，和欧洲、亚洲、非洲、北美洲、南美洲一样重要。在我看来，浩瀚海洋中冒出的这些岛屿，都极有可能是一个大陆的最高处，那个大陆现在已经沉入海里了，但是在史前时代是在海面以上的。”","“Why not?” replied Cyrus Harding.“Why should not Australia, New Ireland, Australasia, united to the archipelagoes of the Pacific, have once formed a sixth part of the world, as important as Europe or Asia, as Africa or the two Americas?To my mind, it is quite possible that all these islands, emerging from this vast ocean, are but the summits of a continent, now submerged, but which was above the waters at a prehistoric period.”"
"“就像之前的亚特兰蒂斯一样。”赫伯特答道。","“As the Atlantis was formerly,” replied Herbert."
"“是的，孩子，假如它真的存在的话。”","“Yes, my boy... if, however, it existed.”"
"“林肯岛会是那个大陆的一部分吗？”潘克洛夫问道。","“And would Lincoln Island have been a part of that continent?” asked Pencroft."
"“很有可能，”赛勒斯·哈丁答道，“这就可以充分解释为什么岛上物产如此丰富了。”","“It is probable,” replied Cyrus Harding, “and that would sufficiently, explain the variety of productions which are seen on its surface.”"
"“还有生活在这里的各种飞禽走兽。”赫伯特补充道。","“And the great number of animals which still inhabit it,” added Herbert."
"“是的，孩子，”工程师回答道，“你的论点支持了我的理论。就我们现在所见的来说，岛上的动物肯定是数不胜数的，更奇怪的是物种极为丰富。在我看来，原因是林肯岛从前也许是一个广阔大陆的一部分，这个大陆已经渐渐沉入了太平洋中。”","“Yes, my boy,” replied the engineer, “and you furnish me with an argument to support my theory.It is certain, after what we have seen, that animals are numerous in this island, and what is more strange, that the species are extremely varied.There is a reason for that, and to me it is that Lincoln Island may have formerly been a part of some vast continent which had gradually sunk below the Pacific.”"
"“那么，将来有一天，”潘克洛夫看起来并不完全相信，他说道，“远古大陆的剩余部分可能也会消失，美洲和亚洲之间就什么陆地也没有了。”","“Then, some fine day,” said Pencroft, who did not appear to be entirely convinced, “the rest of this ancient continent may disappear in its turn, and there will be nothing between America and Asia.”"
"“是的，”哈丁回答道，“将来会有新大陆的，数以亿计的微生物此刻正在建造着呢。”","“Yes,” replied Harding, “there will be new continents which millions and millions of animalculae are building at this moment.”"
"“那么谁是泥瓦匠呢？”潘克洛夫问道。","“And what are these masons?” asked Pencroft."
"“珊瑚虫，”赛勒斯·哈丁答道，“他们经年累月地作用形成了克莱蒙特岛和太平洋上其他不计其数的珊瑚岛。4700万个珊瑚虫才相当于一粒米的重量，但是这些微生物在吸收了海水中的盐分和固体物质之后，就能产生石灰，这种石灰形成了巨大的‘海底建筑群’，坚硬程度堪比花岗岩。从前，万物初生之时，大自然用火积成了陆地，但是现在她将这项工作赋予了这些微生物，它们接替了火的职务，地球内部火的动力很明显地消失了，现在地表上实际熄灭的大量火山就是明证。而且我相信，经过一代代珊瑚虫的努力，多少个世纪过后，太平洋中将会出现一个广阔的陆地，我们的后代可以在那里居住，创造文明。”","“Coral insects,” replied Cyrus Harding.“By constant work they made the island of Clermont-Tonnerre, and numerous other coral islands in the Pacific Ocean.Forty-seven millions of these insects are needed to weigh a grain, and yet, with the sea-salt they absorb, the solid elements of water which they assimilate, these animalculae produce limestone, and this limestone forms enormous submarine erections, of which the hardness and solidity equal granite.Formerly, at the first periods of creation, nature employing fire, heaved up the land, but now she entrusts to these microscopic creatures the task of replacing this agent, of which the dynamic power in the interior of the globe has evidently diminished—which is proved by the number of volcanoes on the surface of the earth, now actually extinct.And I believe that centuries succeeding to centuries, and insects to insects, this Pacific may one day be changed into a vast continent, which new generations will inhabit and civilize in their turn.”"
"“那可要很长时间。”潘克洛夫说。","“That will take a long time,” said Pencroft."
"“大自然有的是时间来进行这项工作。”工程师回答道。","“Nature has time for it,” replied the engineer."
"“但是新大陆有什么用呢？”赫伯特问道，“我觉得已有的可居住陆地面积已经足够人类用了。不过大自然不会平白无故创造东西。”","“But what would be the use of new continents?” asked Herbert.“It appears to me that the present extent of habitable countries is sufficient for humanity.Yet nature does nothing uselessly.”"
"“不错，不会有没用的东西，”工程师答道，“这就解释了将来出现新大陆的必要性，而且恰好在珊瑚岛密布的热带地区。起码对我来说，这种解释似乎是合情合理的。","“Nothing uselessly, certainly,” replied the engineer, “but this is how the necessity of new continents for the future, and exactly on the tropical zone occupied by the coral islands, may be explained.At least to me this explanation appears plausible.”"
"“我们听着呢，上尉。”赫伯特说道。","“We are listening, captain,” said Herbert."
"“这是我的观点：哲学家们一般都认为有一天地球会毁灭，更确切地说，动物和植物会因为无法经受极度寒冷的气候而灭绝。他们不能达成共识的是这种严寒的成因。有一些人认为几百万年后，太阳散发出的热量会大大减少，从未引发严寒；有些人相信地球内部的热量逐渐消减的理论，认为这种情况对地球产生的影响之大超出我们的想象。我相信后一种假设，这种理论的事实依据就是：尽管太阳向月亮输送与地球相同的热量，月球是一个绝不适宜居住的寒冷星球。那月球为什么变得这么冷呢？因为天体世界中的所有星体都是源于内部火焰，但是月亮中的火已经完全消失了。最后，不管是什么原因，我们的星球终有一天会变冷，但严寒只是一个逐渐变化的过程。那么，到时候会产生什么情况呢？温带地区在一个遥远的时期后，将和我们现在所处的极地地区一样不适宜居住。那时候，人类和动物都会涌向更直接受到太阳影响的纬度地区。大规模的迁移将会出现。欧洲、中亚、北美将会逐渐被废弃，澳大利亚和南美的低纬度地区也是如此。那里的草木也会随着人口转移。植物会和动物同时向赤道撤退。南美洲和非洲中部将会成为主要的居住区。拉普兰人和萨摩亚人会发现，极地地区的气候和地中海岸边的差不多。在现阶段，谁能说赤道地区不会太小，而容不下、养育不了陆地居民呢?也许，大自然有先见之明，为了使所有的动植物迁移到可以避难的地方，现在就开始在赤道地区为新大陆奠定基础，这些小虫不就可能是受大自然的委托，来进行这项工作吗？我经常思考这些问题，朋友们，我深信将来地球的面貌会发生彻底的改变。随着新大陆的产生，旧大陆会被淹没，在未来的时代，会有一个像哥伦布那样的人发现钦博拉索山、喜马拉雅山和勃朗山所形成的岛屿，它们都是美洲、亚洲、欧洲沉没后的遗迹。然后，这些新大陆也会变得不适宜居住了，热量会渐渐消失，就像灵魂离开肉体后，肉体会冰冷一样。那时候，地球上的生命就会灭绝，即使不是永久灭绝，也要持续一段时期。也许那时候，我们的星球会休息，所用生物死亡，等到条件转好的时候再复苏过来！但是所有这些都是造物主的秘密，我从珊瑚虫的工作说起，一直探究到地球未来的秘密，也许扯得太远了。”","“This is my idea: philosophers generally admit that some day our globe will end, or rather that animal and vegetable life will no longer be possible, because of the intense cold to which it will be subjected.What they are not agreed upon, is the cause of this cold.Some think that it will arise from the falling of the temperature, which the sun will experience alter millions of years; others, from the gradual extinction of the fires in the interior of our globe, which have a greater influence on it than is generally supposed.I hold to this last hypothesis, grounding it on the fact that the moon is really a cold star, which is no longer habitable, although the sun continues to throw on its surface the same amount of heat.If, then, the moon has become cold, it is because the interior fires to which, as do all the stars of the stellar world, it owes its origin, are completely extinct.Lastly, whatever may be the cause, our globe will become cold some day, but this cold will only operate gradually.What will happen, then?The temperate zones, at a more or less distant period, will not be more habitable than the polar regions now are.Then the population of men, as well as the animals, will flow towards the latitudes which are more directly under the solar influence.An immense emigration will take place.Europe, Central Asia, North America, will gradually be abandoned, as well as Australasia and the lower parts of South America.The vegetation will follow the human emigration.The flora will retreat towards the Equator at the same time as the fauna.The central parts of South America and Africa will be the continents chiefly inhabited.The Laplanders and the Samoides will find the climate of the polar regions on the shores of the Mediterranean.Who can say, that at this period, the equatorial regions will not be too small, to contain and nourish terrestrial humanity?Now, may not provident nature, so as to give refuge to all the vegetable and animal emigration, be at present laying the foundation of a new continent under the Equator, and may she not have entrusted these insects with the construction of it?I have often thought of all these things, my friends, and I seriously believe that the aspect of our globe will some day be completely changed; that by the raising of new continents the sea will cover the old, and that, in future ages, a Columbus will go to discover the islands of Chimborazo, of the Himalayas, or of Mont Blanc, remains of a submerged America, Asia, and Europe.Then these new continents will become, in their turn, uninhabitable; heat will die away, as does the heat from a body when the soul has left it; and life will disappear from the globe, if not for ever, at least for a period.Perhaps then, our spheroid will rest—will be left to death—to revive some day under superior conditions!But all that, my friends, is the secret of the Author of all things; and beginning by the work of the insects, I have perhaps let myself be carried too far, in investigating the secrets of the future."
"“亲爱的赛勒斯，”史佩莱回答道，“我觉得你的这些理论都是预言，将来有一天会实现的。”","“My dear Cyrus,” replied Spilett, “these theories are prophecies to me, and they will be accomplished some day.”"
"“那都是上帝的秘密。”工程师说道。","“That is the secret of God,” said the engineer."
"“你的理论很不错，”潘克洛夫说，他一直都很聚精会神地听着，“但是上尉，你能告诉我，是否林肯岛也是你说的珊瑚虫建成的呢？”","“All that is well and good,” then said Pencroft, who had listened with all his might, “but will you tell me, captain, if Lincoln Island has been made by your insects?”"
"“不是，”哈丁回答道，“这个岛是地道的火山岛。”","“No,” replied Harding; “it is of a purely volcanic origin.”"
"“那么，将来有一天它也会消失吗？”","“Then it will disappear some day?”"
"“有可能。”","“That is probable."
"“我希望那时候我们已经不在这里了。”","“I hope we won’t be here then.”"
"“不，不要担心，潘克洛夫，那时候我们就不会在这里了，因为我们并不想老死在这里，还希望有一天离开这里。”","“No, don’t be uneasy, Pencroft; we shall not be here then, as we have no wish to die here, and hope to get away some time.”"
"“同时，”吉丁·史佩莱说道，“让我们好好建立家园，就像要永远居住在这里一样。半途而废就于事无补了。”","“In the meantime,” replied Gideon Spilett, “let us establish ourselves here as if forever.There is no use in doing things by halves.”"
"他们的谈话就这样结束了。吃完早饭之后，他们继续探险，到达了沼泽地的边缘。这片沼泽大约有20平方英里，一直延伸到海岛东南部的圆形海岸。土壤是燧石粘土，其中还有腐烂的植物，比如灯芯草、芦苇和野草。到处都有厚如地毯的草垫铺在地上。这里有很多结冰的水坑，在太阳的照射下闪闪发光。雨水和突然暴涨的河水都不能为这些水塘提供水源。因此，他们很自然地得出这样一个结论：沼泽地的水分是从土壤中渗透出来的，事实也确实如此。大家同时也担心，天热的时候，这里产生的瘴气会使人患热病。","This ended the conversation.Breakfast was finished, the exploration was continued, and the settlers arrived at the border of the marshy region.It was a marsh of which the extent, to the rounded coast which terminated the island at the southeast, was about twenty square miles.The soil was formed of clayey flint-earth, mingled with vegetable matter, such as the remains of rushes, reeds, grass, etc.Here and there beds of grass, thick as a carpet, covered it.In many places icy pools sparkled in the sun.Neither rain nor any river, increased by a sudden swelling, could supply these ponds.They therefore naturally concluded that the marsh was fed by the infiltrations of the soil and it was really so.It was also to be feared that during the heat miasmas would arise, which might produce fevers."
"不流动的水塘上面，长着一些水生植物，大量飞禽在上面拍打着翅膀。成群的野鸭、短颈野鸭和鹬栖居在那里，它们不怕人，人们可以轻易走近他们。","Above the aquatic plants, on the surface of the stagnant water, fluttered numbers of birds.Wild duck, teal, snipe lived there in flocks, and those fearless birds allowed themselves to be easily approached."
"这些水禽密密麻麻地聚集在一起，一枪准能打死好几十只。但是，这些探险家们所能使用的只有弓箭了。收获虽然没有那么多，不过弓箭有个优点就是没有声音，不会吓到这些鸟，而枪声就会使它们飞散到沼泽各处。猎人们很满意，他们这次打到了12只鸭子，这些鸭子的身体是白色的，有黄褐色的花纹，头是绿的，翅膀上有黑、白、红三种颜色，长着扁平的嘴。赫伯特把它们叫做潦凫。托普也在捕捉时出了力，大家把小岛上的沼泽地部分称为“托普”。居民们以后就会在这里打到丰富的水鸟了。在以后的某个时间，他们打算更细致地探查一下，可能这里的一些水鸟可以被驯养，或者至少可以把它们带到湖边去，这样捉起来就更容易了。","One shot from a gun would certainly have brought down some dozen of the birds, they were so close together.The explorers were, however, obliged to content themselves with bows and arrows.The result was less, but the silent arrow had the advantage of not frightening the birds, while the noise of firearms would have dispersed them to all parts of the marsh.The hunters were satisfied, for this time, with a dozen ducks, which had white bodies with a band of cinnamon, a green head, wings black, white, and red, and flattened beak.Herbert called them tadorns.Top helped in the capture of these birds, whose name was given to this marshy part of the island.The settlers had here an abundant reserve of aquatic game.At some future time they meant to explore it more carefully, and it was probable that some of the birds there might be domesticated, or at least brought to the shores of the lake, so that they would be more within their reach."
"傍晚五点钟的时候，赛勒斯·哈丁和同伴们踏上了返回住所的路，他们跨过有潦凫栖息的沼泽，穿过慈悲河上的冰桥。","About five o’clock in the evening Cyrus Harding and his companions retraced their steps to their dwelling by traversing Tadorn’s Fens, and crossed the Mercy on the ice-bridge."
"晚上八点钟，他们都回到了花岗石宫。","At eight in the evening they all entered Granite House."
"第二十二章","Chapter 22"
"严寒的天气一直持续到8月15号，但是，气温并未低过前面提到的华氏温度。风平浪静的时候，低温并不是那么难以忍受，然而如果遇到刮风的天气，这群可怜的居民因为没有足够的衣物，就感觉很难受。令潘克洛夫感到遗憾的是：林肯岛上有许多狐狸和海豹，可却不是几种熊类的家园。","This intense cold lasted till the 15th of August, without, however, passing the degree of Fahrenheit already mentioned.When the atmosphere was calm, the low temperature was easily borne, but when the wind blew, the poor settlers, insufficiently clothed, felt it severely.Pencroft regretted that Lincoln Island was not the home of a few families of bears rather than of so many foxes and seals."
"“熊啊，”他道，“通常有着厚厚的皮毛，我不过是要借他们背上那暖和的斗篷一用，好度过这个冬天。”","“Bears,” said he, “are generally very well dressed, and I ask no more than to borrow for the winter the warm cloaks which they have on their backs.”"
"“但是，”纳布笑道，“或许那些熊不会同意把他们的斗篷给你，潘克洛夫。这些野兽可不是圣马丁。”","“But,” replied Neb, laughing, “perhaps the bears would not consent to give you their cloaks, Pencroft.These beasts are not St. Martins.”"
"“我们会让它们同意的，纳布，我们做得到。”潘克洛夫用一种不容置疑的语气说道。","“We would make them do it, Neb, we would make them,” replied Pencroft, in quite an authoritative tone."
"但是这座岛上根本不存在这种凶猛的食肉动物，或者至少它们还没有现身。","But these formidable carnivora did not exist in the island, or at any rate they had not yet shown themselves."
"与此同时，赫伯特、潘克洛夫和记者忙着在眺望岗和森林边缘设置捕猎用的陷阱。","In the meanwhile, Herbert, Pencroft, and the reporter occupied themselves with making traps on Prospect Heights and at the border of the forest."
"在水手看来，任何动物，不管它是什么，都是猎人合法的战利品，无论是噬齿动物还是食肉动物，只要掉进新设好的陷阱里，那就应当被带到花岗石宫好好享用。","According to the sailor, any animal, whatever it was, would be a lawful prize, and the rodents or carnivora which might get into the new snares would be well received at Granite House."
"而且陷阱的设置也极其简单，在地上挖好洞，上面盖上些树枝和草叶遮住洞口，洞里布好诱饵，诱饵散发出的香味会把猎物吸引过来。还需要提及的是，陷阱的地点并不是随意选择的，而是在有无数脚印的地方，这显示出四足动物经常出没。他们每天都会在不同的时间去查看三次，最初几天，捉到的尽是他们在慈悲河右岸见到过的白狐。","The traps were besides extremely simple; being pits dug in the ground, a platform of branches and grass above, which concealed the opening, and at the bottom some bait, the scent of which would attract animals.It must be mentioned also, that they had not been dug at random, but at certain places where numerous footprints showed that quadrupeds frequented the ground.They were visited every day, and at three different times, during the first days, specimens of those Antarctic foxes which they had already seen on the right bank of the Mercy were found in them."
"当潘克洛夫第三次从洞中揪出一只狐狸时，不禁喊道：“怎么回事，这里尽是些狐狸！”他十分厌恶地看着这只狐狸，又说道：“这些动物一点用处都没有！”","“Why, there are nothing but foxes in this country!” cried Pencroft, when for the third time he drew one of the animals out of the pit.Looking at it in great disgust, he added, “beasts which are good for nothing!”"
"“不尽其然，”吉丁·史佩莱说道，“它们还是有用处的！”","“Yes,” said Gideon Spilett, “they are good for something!”"
"“什么用处？”","“And what is that?”"
"“作为诱饵吸引其他动物过来啊！”","“To make bait to attract other creatures!”"
"记者的话没错，从此以后，陷阱里的诱饵就换成了死狐狸。","The reporter was right, and the traps were henceforward baited with the foxes carcasses."
"水手又从一种植物上取下结实的长纤维做成圈套，效果甚至比陷阱还要好。几乎每天都会有养兔场的兔子被捉住。虽然食物总是兔子，但是纳布会调制不同的酱汁，因而居民们并无怨言。","The sailor had also made snares from the long tough fibers of a certain plant, and they were even more successful than the traps.Rarely a day passed without some rabbits from the warren being caught.It was always rabbit, but Neb knew how to vary his sauces and the settlers did not think of complaining."
"但是，八月里的第二个星期，有那么一两次，猎人们发现陷阱里困了一些其他动物，比狐狸用处大多了，其中包括他们先前在湖的北面看到过的小野猪。潘克洛夫不需要问这些野兽是否可以吃。他一看就知道了，这些小野猪同美洲和欧洲的猪很相像。","However, once or twice in the second week of August, the traps supplied the hunters with other animals more useful than foxes, namely, several of those small wild boars which had already been seen to the north of the lake.Pencroft had no need to ask if these beasts were eatable.He could see that by their resemblance to the pig of America and Europe."
"“但是这不是猪，”赫伯特对他说，“我提醒你，潘克洛夫。”","“But these are not pigs,” said Herbert to him, “I warn you of that, Pencroft.”"
"“孩子，”水手边说边弯腰，取出一只这类野猪的代表，揪着它们充当尾巴的小肢体。“就让我以为它们是猪吧。”","“My boy,” replied the sailor, bending over the trap and drawing out one of these representatives of the family of sus by the little appendage which served it as a tail.“Let me believe that these are pigs.”"
"“为什么呢？”","“Why?”"
"“因为这样，我会很高兴啊！”","“Because that pleases me!”"
"“你很喜欢猪吗，潘克洛夫?”","“Are you very fond of pig then, Pencroft?”"
"“我很喜欢猪，”水手回答道，“尤其喜欢它的蹄子，如果它有八只蹄子而不是四只，我会加倍喜欢它的！”","“I am very fond of pig,” replied the sailor, “particularly of its feet, and if it had eight instead of four, I should like it twice as much!”"
"他们捕捉到的动物属于四种野猪中的一种，也是西貒类的，它们的皮毛颜色深，而且没有同类动物嘴部的长獠牙，从这两点就可以将它们辨别出来。这些野猪一般群居，而且在小岛的森林地带可能会有很多这种动物。","As to the animals in question, they were peccaries belonging to one of the four species which are included in the family, and they were also of the species of Tajacu, recognizable by their deep color and the absence of those long teeth with which the mouths of their congeners are armed.These peccaries generally live in herds, and it was probable that they abounded in the woody parts of the island."
"无论如何，它们从头到脚都可以吃，潘克洛夫也就别无所求了。","At any rate, they were eatable from head to foot, and Pencroft did not ask more from them."
"将近8月15号的时候，风向转为西北，这缓和了大气中的冷空气。温度也升高了几度，而空气中不断累积的水汽不久就分解成雪了。整座小岛都被白色覆盖了，向这里的居民们显示出一幅新的景象。大雪纷纷扬扬地下了几天，不久，地上的积雪就有两英尺厚了。","Towards the 15th of August, the state of the atmosphere was suddenly moderated by the wind shifting to the northwest.The temperature rose some degrees, and the accumulated vapor in the air was not long in resolving into snow.All the island was covered with a sheet of white, and showed itself to its inhabitants under a new aspect.The snow fell abundantly for several days, and it soon reached a thickness of two feet."
"风力依然强劲，在花岗石宫，可以听到海浪冲击礁石的声音，震耳欲聋。在某些地方，绕着拐角旋转的风使雪花形成了高高的漩涡柱，就像那些底部旋转的水柱，船只遇到这种水柱的时候会开枪轰击。但是，从西北方向刮过来的暴风雪横扫海岛，而花岗石宫所处的位置使它得以避免遭到暴风雪的正面袭击。","The wind also blew with great violence, and at the height of Granite House the sea could be heard thundering against the reefs.In some places, the wind, eddying round the corners, formed the snow into tall whirling columns, resembling those waterspouts which turn round on their base, and which vessels attack with a shot from a gun.However, the storm, coming from the northwest, blew across the island, and the position of Granite House preserved it from a direct attack."
"然而，这场暴风雪就如同它在极地国家形成的一样可怕。因而这些天，赛勒斯·哈丁及其同伴们不敢贸然前进，尽管他们很想这样做，却也不得不关门闭户了五天，从8月20日到25日。他们可以听到风暴在啄木鸟树林里肆虐的声音，那里一定惨不忍睹了。许多大树一定会被连根拔起，但是潘克洛夫为了自我安慰，就想，这样就不用费力去砍树了。","But in the midst of this snow-storm, as terrible as if it had been produced in some polar country, neither Cyrus Harding nor his companions could, notwithstanding their wish for it, venture forth, and they remained shut up for five days, from the 20th to the 25th of August.They could hear the tempest raging in Jacamar Wood, which would surely suffer from it.Many of the trees would no doubt be torn up by the roots, but Pencroft consoled himself by thinking that he would not have the trouble of cutting them down."
"“风现在成了伐木工，不用管它。”他重复道。","“The wind is turning woodman, let it alone,” he repeated."
"而且，即便他们想要阻止它，也无计可施。","Besides, there was no way of stopping it, if they had wished to do so."
"花岗石宫的居民们非常感激上天赐给他们这样一个坚不可催、固定不动的容身之处。其中当然有一部分感谢是属于赛勒斯·哈丁的，但毕竟是大自然之力挖出了这个大石洞，他只是发现了而已。他们都很安全，暴风雪无法触及他们。如果他们在眺望岗用砖块和木头建房子，那么肯定无法抵挡这场暴风雪的侵袭。至于“石窟”，一定是不能居住了，因为漫过小岛的海水会猛烈地冲击那里。但是这里，位于坚硬岩石间的花岗石宫，海浪和风力都无法施加影响，因而他们不需要惧怕什么。","How grateful the inhabitants of Granite House then were to Heaven for having prepared for them this solid and immovable retreat!Cyrus Harding had also his legitimate share of thanks, but after all, it was Nature who had hollowed out this vast cavern, and he had only discovered it.There all were in safety, and the tempest could not reach them.If they had constructed a house of bricks and wood on Prospect Heights, it certainly would not have resisted the fury of this storm.As to the Chimneys, it must have been absolutely uninhabitable, for the sea, passing over the islet, would beat furiously against it.But here, in Granite House, in the middle of a solid mass, over which neither the sea nor air had any influence, there was nothing to fear."
"在无法出门的这些天，居民们也并未闲着。","During these days of seclusion the settlers did not remain inactive."
"储藏室里有充足的木材，他们把木材锯成木板，一点一点地完成了家具的制作。由于原材料充裕，他们做成的桌椅都是最结实的。纳布和潘克洛夫为制成这些厚重的家具感到自豪，无论别人拿什么来换，他们也不肯。","There was no want of wood, cut up into planks, in the storeroom, and little by little they completed their furnishing; constructing the most solid of tables and chairs, for material was not spared.Neb and Pencroft were very proud of this rather heavy furniture, which they would not have changed on any account."
"接着，这些木匠们又开始成了编篮子的，而且这项新活他们完成得还不错。在湖区凸向北面的一端，他们发现了一片柳树林，那里生长着大量的紫柳。在雨季到来之前，潘克洛夫和赫伯特就已将这些用处很多的灌木砍了下来，经过仔细加工后的柳枝现在可以派上大用场了。刚开始编的几个篮子有些粗糙，但是后来工人们运用他们的聪明才智，通过回想、借鉴他们以前见过的篮子形状，并相互模仿，拓荒者的财产很快因为几个大大小小的篮子而增长了。他们把篮子放在储藏室里，纳布还挑了几个篮子，专门用来盛放收集来的根茎和南欧松子等等。","Then the carpenters became basket-makers, and they did not succeed badly in this new manufacture.At the point of the lake which projected to the north, they had discovered an osier-bed in which grew a large number of purple osiers.Before the rainy season, Pencroft and Herbert had cut down these useful shrubs, and their branches, well prepared, could now be effectively employed.The first attempts were somewhat crude, but in consequence of the cleverness and intelligence of the workmen, by consulting, and recalling the models which they had seen, and by emulating each other, the possessions of the colony were soon increased by several baskets of different sizes.The storeroom was provided with them, and in special baskets Neb placed his collection of rhizomes, stone-pine almonds, etc."
"八月的最后一个星期，天气再度变得温和了。温度降低了一点，暴风雪也减弱了。这群拓荒者就立即出动了。海岸上的雪足有两英尺厚，但是他们在冻得硬邦邦的雪面上行走，倒也没多大困难。赛勒斯·哈丁和同伴们爬上了眺望岗。","During the last week of the month of August the weather moderated again.The temperature fell a little, and the tempest abated.The colonists sallied out directly.There was certainly two feet of snow on the shore, but they were able to walk without much difficulty on the hardened surface.Cyrus Harding and his companions climbed Prospect Heights."
"变化真大啊！他们先前离开的树林还是一片绿色，尤其是长有大片枞树的那部分，现在全不见了，换上了统一的颜色。整个小岛，从富兰克林山顶到海岸、森林、平原、湖泊和河流，都是一片白雪皑皑。慈悲河的河水在冰面下潺潺地流过，每次涨潮和落潮的时候，水流会把冰块冲破，发出很响的碎裂声。无数的鸟儿在冰冻的湖面上拍打着翅膀。上千只鸭子、鹬、短颈野鸭和海鸥聚在一起。有瀑布流出的岩石中布满冰柱。这会让人觉得，水是从形状怪异的滴水口中流出来的，滴水口的形状像是借文艺复兴时期艺术家丰富的想象力造就的。这场暴风雪给森林带来的破坏程度还不能确定，他们必须等到覆盖森林的雪层消融后才知道。","What a change!The woods, which they had left green, especially in the part at which the firs predominated, had disappeared under a uniform color.All was white, from the summit of Mount Franklin to the shore, the forests, the plains, the lake, the river.The waters of the Mercy flowed under a roof of ice, which, at each rising and ebbing of the tide, broke up with loud crashes.Numerous birds fluttered over the frozen surface of the lake.Ducks and snipe, teal and guillemots were assembled in thousands.The rocks among which the cascade flowed were bristling with icicles.One might have said that the water escaped by a monstrous gargoyle, shaped with all the imagination of an artist of the Renaissance.As to the damage caused by the storm in the forest, that could not as yet be ascertained; they would have to wait till the snowy covering was dissipated."
"吉丁·史佩莱、潘克洛夫和赫伯特抓住这个机会去查看他们的陷阱。因为陷阱被大雪遮住了，他们花费了一番工夫才找到。他们还必须小心翼翼，以免掉进陷阱里去，那样会很危险，而掉进自己设置的陷阱里是很丢脸的！但幸运的是，这种不快并没有发生，而且他们发现自己的陷阱完好无损。没有动物掉进陷阱里，然而周围却有大量足印，其中有一些很明显是动物的爪印。赫伯特毫不犹豫地确定，一些猫科动物从这里经过，这也印证了工程师的看法，林肯岛上有危险的野兽。这些动物无疑大多住在远西森林里，因饥饿所迫，才冒险走这么远到眺望岗觅食。或许它们已经嗅到了花岗石宫居民们的味道。“那么，这些猫科动物是什么呢？”潘克洛夫问道。“是老虎。”赫伯特回答道。“不是只有热带地区的国家才会有老虎吗？”","Gideon Spilett, Pencroft, and Herbert did not miss this opportunity of going to visit their traps.They did not find them easily, under the snow with which they were covered.They had also to be careful not to fall into one or other of them, which would have been both dangerous and humiliating; to be taken in their own snares!But happily they avoided this unpleasantness, and found their traps perfectly intact.No animal had fallen into them, and yet the footprints in the neighborhood were very numerous, among others, certain very clear marks of claws.Herbert did not hesitate to affirm that some animal of the feline species had passed there, which justified the engineer’s opinion that dangerous beasts existed in Lincoln Island.These animals doubtless generally lived in the forests of the Far West, but pressed by hunger, they had ventured as far as Prospect Heights.Perhaps they had smelled out the inhabitants of Granite House.“Now, what are these feline creatures?” asked Pencroft.“They are tigers,” replied Herbert.“I thought those beasts were only found in hot countries?”"
"“在新大陆上，”少年回答道，“从墨西哥到布宜诺斯艾利斯的潘帕斯草原上都有老虎。而林肯岛和拉普拉塔地区几乎处于同一纬度，在这里会碰到老虎也就不足为奇了。”","“On the new continent,” replied the lad, “they are found from Mexico to the Pampas of Buenos Aires.Now, as Lincoln Island is nearly under the same latitude as the provinces of La Plata, it is not surprising that tigers are to be met with in it.”"
"“那么，我们必须小心点它们了。”潘克洛夫答道。","“Well, we must look out for them,” replied Pencroft."
"然而，随着温度不断升高，雪很快就融化并消失了。下了场雨后，大地披着的银色外衣就消失了。尽管天气恶劣，居民们还是存储了新的不同的东西，植物类的有南欧松子、根茎和枫树的浆汁；动物类的有兔子、刺鼠和袋鼠。为了获取这些东西，他们到森林里去了几次，发现很多树都被上次那场暴风雪吹倒了。潘克洛夫和纳布还推着车到很远的煤矿脉那里，带回来几吨燃料。他们在路上看到烧制陶器的土窑已经被大风严重摧毁了，至少有六英尺已经被吹倒了。","However, the snow soon disappeared, quickly dissolving under the influence of the rising temperature.Rain fell, and the sheet of white soon vanished.Notwithstanding the bad weather, the settlers renewed their stores of different things, stone-pine almonds, rhizomes, syrup from the maple-tree, for the vegetable part; rabbits from the warren, agouties, and kangaroos for the animal part.This necessitated several excursions into the forest, and they found that a great number of trees had been blown down by the last hurricane.Pencroft and Neb also pushed with the cart as far as the vein of coal, and brought back several tons of fuel.They saw in passing that the pottery kiln had been severely damaged by the wind, at least six feet of it having been blown off."
"同时，他们又在花岗石宫新存储了些煤和木头，而且他们借助水流再度畅通的慈悲河，运送了几木筏的燃料。他们明白寒冷的季节并未结束。","At the same time as the coal, the store of wood was renewed at Granite House, and they profited by the current of the Mercy having again become free, to float down several rafts.They could see that the cold period was not ended."
"他们也去“石窟”看了一回，居民们非常庆幸暴风雪侵袭的时候，他们没有住在这里。这里明显留下海水肆虐的痕迹。海水曾漫过小岛，猛烈地冲击通道，有一半的通道里满是泥土，而厚厚的海藻遮盖了岩石。当纳布、赫伯特和潘克洛夫去打猎或是收集木柴时，赛勒斯·哈丁和吉丁·史佩莱忙着修复“石窟”，他们发现炼铁炉和风箱几乎没有受到损害，它们在沙堆下一直免遭损害。","A visit was also paid to the Chimneys, and the settlers could not but congratulate themselves on not having been living there during the hurricane.The sea had left unquestionable traces of its ravages.Sweeping over the islet, it had furiously assailed the passages, half filling them with sand, while thick beds of seaweed covered the rocks.While Neb, Herbert, and Pencroft hunted or collected wood, Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett busied themselves in putting the Chimneys to rights, and they found the forge and the bellows almost unhurt, protected as they had been from the first by the heaps of sand."
"储存的燃料也派上了用场。居民们得以抵御寒冷的天气。众所周知，在北半球，二月份的主要特点就是温度骤降。南半球也是如此，这里的八月底正是北美洲的二月份，也逃脱不了这一气候定律。","The store of fuel had not been made uselessly.The settlers had not done with the rigorous cold.It is known that, in the Northern Hemisphere, the month of February is principally distinguished by rapid fallings of the temperature.It is the same in the Southern Hemisphere, and the end of the month of August, which is the February of North America, does not escape this climatic law."
"大约25号的时候，降雪天气转为降雨，风向转为东南，天气的寒冷突然又加剧了。据工程师的估计，温度不会高过华氏温度计水银柱标注的零下八度，而这种寒冷的天气，加上刺骨的寒风，持续了好几天，让人痛苦不堪。这群拓荒者不得不再次躲在花岗石宫里，因为不得不将正面所有的洞口严实地堵住，只留一道窄窄的缝隙供空气流通，蜡烛的消耗量相当大。为了节省蜡烛，他们经常不惜使用燃料，在石洞中只用燃烧的炉火照明。有几次，居民中有一两个人从花岗石宫下来，到冰块包围着的海滩上去，这些冰块是在海浪一次次涨潮和落潮的时候堆积形成的，但是他们很快就又爬回花岗石宫，他们双手握住梯档的时候，不仅感到疼痛，而且还很费力。由于酷寒，他们的手指一碰到梯档就仿佛灼烧一样。为了帮花岗石宫的居民们打发闲暇时光，赛勒斯·哈丁开始了一种可以在室内进行的活动。","About the 25th, after another change from snow to rain, the wind shifted to the southeast, and the cold became, suddenly, very severe.According to the engineer’s calculation, the mercurial column of a Fahrenheit thermometer would not have marked less than eight degrees below zero, and this intense cold, rendered still more painful by a sharp gale, lasted for several days.The colonists were again shut up in Granite House, and as it was necessary to hermetically seal all the openings of the facade, only leaving a narrow passage for renewing the air, the consumption of candles was considerable.To economize them, the cavern was often only lighted by the blazing hearths, on which fuel was not spared.Several times, one or other of the settlers descended to the beach in the midst of ice which the waves heaped up at each tide, but they soon climbed up again to Granite House, and it was not without pain and difficulty that their hands could hold to the rounds of the ladder.In consequence of the intense cold, their fingers felt as if burned when they touched the rounds.To occupy the leisure hours, which the tenants of Granite House now had at their disposal, Cyrus Harding undertook an operation which could be performed indoors."
"我们知道居民们没有现成的糖，而是在枫树上割开很深的口子，从中获取汁液。他们用瓶子收集枫树的汁液，并用于烹制不同的食物。时间一久，这种液体就开始变白，成了一种浓稠的糖浆，他们对此十分满意。","We know that the settlers had no other sugar at their disposal than the liquid substance which they drew from the maple, by making deep incisions in the tree.They contented themselves with collecting this liquor in jars and employing it in this state for different culinary purposes, and the more so, as on growing old, this liquid began to become white and to be of a syrupy consistence."
"但是还有更好的方法制作糖浆，一天，赛勒斯·哈丁宣布他们将要成为炼糖工人了。","But there was something better to be made of it, and one day Cyrus Harding announced that they were going to turn into refiners."
"“炼糖工人！”潘克洛夫回应道，“我想这是个不错的行当。”","“Refiners!” replied Pencroft.“That is rather a warm trade, I think.”"
"“很不错。”工程师答道。","“Very warm,” answered the engineer."
"“很合时宜嘛！”水手道。","“Then it will be seasonable!” said the sailor."
"“炼制”这个词不需要使你脑海中浮现出有着设备和无数工人的庞大工厂。情况不是那样的！要使这种液体结晶，只需要一道极其简单的工序。把盛有糖浆的大土罐放在火上，糖浆很容易就开始蒸发，不久表面就起了一层浮渣。等到浮渣开始变厚，纳布小心地用木质的小铲子把它清除掉，这就加速了糖浆的蒸发，同时也要避免产生烧焦的味道。","This word refining need not awake in the mind thoughts of an elaborate manufactory with apparatus and numerous workmen.No! to crystallize this liquor, only an extremely easy operation is required.Placed on the fire in large earthen pots, it was simply subjected to evaporation, and soon a scum arose to its surface.As soon as this began to thicken, Neb carefully removed it with a wooden spatula; this accelerated the evaporation, and at the same time prevented it from contracting an empyreumatic flavor."
"在热火上煮几个小时后，糖浆就变得十分浓稠，而且炼糖工人也觉得舒服多了。他们之前在厨房的炉子上制造了一些形状各异的粘土模具，这时候他们就把糖浆倒进这些模具里。第二天，糖浆就冷却了，变成糖块和糖片。这种糖颜色微红，但是却接近透明，并且味道很好。","After boiling for several hours on a hot fire, which did as much good to the operators as the substance operated upon, the latter was transformed into a thick syrup.This syrup was poured into clay molds, previously fabricated in the kitchen stove, and to which they had given various shapes.The next day this syrup had become cold, and formed cakes and tablets.This was sugar of rather a reddish color, but nearly transparent and of a delicious taste."
"寒冷的天气一直持续到九月中旬，这群被困在花岗石宫的人开始觉得沉闷无聊了。他们几乎每天都要想办法出去，但却走不远。他们不停地修缮住处。他们一边工作一边交谈。哈丁向同伴们讲了很多东西，主要是给他们解释科学的实际应用。拓荒者们没有图书馆，然而，工程师总是一本随身携带的书，总是可以翻到他们需要的那一页，可以回答他们所有的问题，而他们也经常向这本书求教。时光就这样欢快地过去了，这些勇敢的人似乎对未来毫不畏惧。","The cold continued to the middle of September, and the prisoners in Granite House began to find their captivity rather tedious.Nearly every day they attempted sorties which they could not prolong.They constantly worked at the improvement of their dwelling.They talked while working.Harding instructed his companions in many things, principally explaining to them the practical applications of science.The colonists had no library at their disposal; but the engineer was a book which was always at hand, always open at the page which one wanted, a book which answered all their questions, and which they often consulted.The time thus passed away pleasantly, these brave men not appearing to have any fears for the future."
"但是，所有的人都渴望看到好天气，至少这难以忍受的寒冷天气快点结束。假如他们有足够的衣物御寒，他们一定已经出去好多次了，无论是去沙丘还是去潦凫沼泽！猎物一定会很容易接近，而且捕猎的战果也一定会很丰硕。但是，赛勒斯·哈丁认为大家的健康十分重要，因为他需要他们，大家也都听从了他的建议。","However, all were anxious to see, if not the fine season, at least the cessation of the insupportable cold.If only they had been clothed in a way to meet it, how many excursions they would have attempted, either to the downs or to Tadorn’s Fens!Game would have been easily approached, and the chase would certainly have been most productive.But Cyrus Harding considered it of importance that no one should injure his health, for he had need of all his hands, and his advice was followed."
"但是必须说明的是，因困守在花岗石宫而感到非常焦躁不安的，除了潘克洛夫，就是托普了。这只忠诚的狗觉得花岗石宫非常狭窄。它来回跑动，从一个房间跑到另一个房间，用自己的方式表明它对于被关在这里感到多么厌倦。哈丁多次注意到，每当托普走近与大海相接的黑井时，也就是储藏室后面的开口，它总是发出奇怪的嗥叫声。它围着这个被木头盖子遮住的洞来回跑。有时它甚至试图把爪子伸到盖子下面，像是想要把盖子掀起来。接着它就开始狂吠，声音里立刻显现出气愤和不安，十分怪异。","But it must be said, that the one who was most impatient of this imprisonment, after Pencroft perhaps, was Top.The faithful dog found Granite House very narrow.He ran backwards and forwards from one room to another, showing in his way how weary he was of being shut up.Harding often remarked that when he approached the dark well which communicated with the sea, and of which the orifice opened at the back of the storeroom, Top uttered singular growlings.He ran round and round this hole, which had been covered with a wooden lid.Sometimes even he tried to put his paws under the lid, as if he wished to raise it.He then yelped in a peculiar way, which showed at once anger and uneasiness."
"托普的这一举动工程师已经观察到好几次了。","The engineer observed this maneuver several times."
"这口井下的深渊有什么特别之处，让这只有灵性的动物如此不安？井下通着大海，这毫无疑问。会不会井下通过小岛的底部，还连着其他狭窄的通道呢？会不会有海洋怪兽时不时地来到井底喘息呢？工程师自己也不甚明白要想什么，而且不禁产生了许多奇怪的、不着边际的幻想。习惯了在科学的现实领域里深入探索的工程师，不容许自己沉溺于这一奇怪的、几乎是超自然的想象。但是，倘若那里没有什么令托普不安，这只颇有灵性的狗怎么会一直试图用嗅觉和听觉来了解这个深渊呢？而狗从来不会浪费时间，徒劳地对着月亮狂吠。赛勒斯·哈丁对托普的这一行为很是疑惑，其程度远远超过了他自己所认为的那样。","What could there be in this abyss to make such an impression on the intelligent animal?The well led to the sea, that was certain.Could narrow passages spread from it through the foundations of the island?Did some marine monster come from time to time, to breathe at the bottom of this well?The engineer did not know what to think, and could not refrain from dreaming of many strange improbabilities.Accustomed to go far into the regions of scientific reality, he would not allow himself to be drawn into the regions of the strange and almost of the supernatural; but yet how to explain why Top, one of those sensible dogs who never waste their time in barking at the moon, should persist in trying with scent and hearing to fathom this abyss, if there was nothing there to cause his uneasiness?Top’s conduct puzzled Cyrus Harding even more than he cared to acknowledge to himself."
"不管怎样，工程师只把这些想法告诉了吉丁·史佩莱，因为他觉得不需要向其他伙伴们讲，因为这些可能只是由于托普的幻觉而产生的疑虑。","At all events, the engineer only communicated his impressions to Gideon Spilett, for he thought it useless to explain to his companions the suspicions which arose from what perhaps was only Top’s fancy."
"寒冷的天气终于结束了。这期间也曾有过降雨、风雪、冰雹和狂风，但是这些恶劣的天气并没有持续多久。冰融化了，雪消失了，海滨、高地、慈悲河岸、森林也都再次变得畅通了。春天的到来让花岗石宫的居民们兴奋不已，不久之后，除了必须在这里吃饭、睡觉的几小时外，他们都不必呆在这里了。","At last the cold ceased.There had been rain, squalls mingled with snow, hailstorms, gusts of wind, but these inclemencies did not last.The ice melted, the snow disappeared; the shore, the plateau, the banks of the Mercy, the forest, again became practicable.This return of spring delighted the tenants of Granite House, and they soon only passed it in the hours necessary for eating and sleeping."
"九月的后半个月里，他们经常去打猎，因而潘克洛夫再次恳求工程师制造火器，他宣称这是赛勒斯·哈丁曾经承诺过的。赛勒斯·哈丁非常清楚，没有特殊的工具，制造出一支能用的枪几乎是不可能的，因而还是推脱了，说以后再做。他像往常那样冷静地观察到，赫伯特和史佩莱已经成为技术纯熟的弓箭手，多种美味的猎物如刺鼠、袋鼠、水豚、鸽子、鸨、野鸭、鹅，总之有皮毛的动物都难逃他们的弓箭，因而他们可以再等些日子。但是倔强的水手全然不听，他不会给工程师片刻安宁，直到工程师承诺满足他的要求。就连吉丁·史佩莱也支持潘克洛夫。","They hunted much in the second part of September, which led Pencroft to again entreat for the firearms, which he asserted had been promised by Cyrus Harding.The latter, knowing well that without special tools it would be nearly impossible for him to manufacture a gun which would be of any use, still drew back and put off the operation to some future time, observing in his usual dry way, that Herbert and Spilett had become very skilful archers, so that many sorts of excellent animals, agouties, kangaroos, capybaras, pigeons, bustards, wild ducks, snipes, in short, game both with fur and feathers, fell victims to their arrows, and that, consequently, they could wait.But the obstinate sailor would listen to nothing of this, and he would give the engineer no peace till he promised to satisfy his desire.Gideon Spilett, however, supported Pencroft."
"“海岛上有没有野兽还不能确定，”他道，“如果有，我们必须想想怎么对付它们，消灭它们。这早晚会成为我们的首要任务。”","“If, which may be doubted,” said he, “the island is inhabited by wild beasts, we must think how to fight with and exterminate them.A time may come when this will be our first duty.”"
"但是这个时候，哈丁满脑子想的并不是火器的问题，而是衣物。居民们身上穿的衣服帮助他们度过了这个冬天，但是熬不过下一个冬天。他们必须不惜一切代价，获取食肉动物或反刍动物的皮毛，既然这里有许多摩弗仑羊，他们就一致同意想办法捉一群过来豢养，或许能给他们派上用场。为家畜建一个畜栏，并为鸟类建一个家禽场，简而言之，就是在岛上建一个农场，这就是他们在天气好的季节里要做的两件重要的工程。","But at this period, it was not the question of firearms which occupied Harding, but that of clothes.Those which the settlers wore had passed this winter, but they would not last until next winter.Skins of carnivora or the wool of ruminants must be procured at any price, and since there were plenty of musmons, it was agreed to consult on the means of forming a flock which might be brought up for the use of the colony.An enclosure for the domestic animals, a poultry-yard for the birds, in a word to establish a sort of farm in the island, such were the two important projects for the fine season."
"因而，考虑到将来要做的这些事，他们应该深入到林肯岛所有未知的地方，也就是说，穿过慈悲河右岸的茂密森林，这片森林从河口一直绵延到盘蛇半岛尽头，以及海岛的整个西部地区。但是这需要在天气稳定的时候进行，于是为了这次探索能很好地进行，他们必须等上一个月的时间。","In consequence and in view of these future establishments, it became of much importance that they should penetrate into all the yet unknown parts of Lincoln Island, that is to say, through that thick forest which extended on the right bank of the Mercy, from its mouth to the extremity of the Serpentine Peninsula, as well as on the whole of its western side.But this needed settled weather, and a month must pass before this exploration could be profitably undertaken."
"因而，他们有些不耐烦地等着，这时发生了一件事情，使得这些居民探索整个疆域的心情更加急切了。","They therefore waited with some impatience, when an incident occurred which increased the desire the settlers had to visit the whole of their domain."
"那天是10月24号。那天，潘克洛夫去查看他的陷阱，他总是在里面放好诱饵。他在其中一个陷阱里发现了三只动物，那是很好的食材。一只母野猪和两只幼崽。","It was the 24th of October.On this day, Pencroft had gone to visit his traps, which he always kept properly baited.In one of them he found three animals which would be very welcome for the larder.They were a female peccary and her two young ones."
"然后，潘克洛夫回到了花岗石宫，他为自己俘获这样的战利品兴奋不已，并且像往常那样大肆炫耀了一番。","Pencroft then returned to Granite House, enchanted with his capture, and, as usual, he made a great show of his game."
"“快来，我们可以大饱口福了，上尉！”他叫道，“还有你，史佩莱先生，也有你的！”","“Come, we shall have a grand feast, captain!” he exclaimed.“And you too, Mr. Spilett, you will eat some!”"
"“我会很开心，”记者回答道，“但是我将要吃的是什么呢？”","“I shall be very happy,” replied the reporter; “but what is it that I am going to eat?”"
"“乳猪。”","“Suckling-pig.”"
"“哦，真的是乳猪吗，潘克洛夫？听你的口气，我还以为你带来的是塞满松露的小鹧鸪呢！”","“Oh, indeed, suckling-pig, Pencroft?To hear you, I thought that you were bringing back a young partridge stuffed with truffles!”"
"“什么？”潘克洛夫大叫，“你的意思是看不起乳猪了？”","“What?” cried Pencroft.“Do you mean to say that you turn up your nose at suckling-pig?’"
"“不是，”史佩莱淡淡地回答道，“如果没有吃腻的话。”","“No,” replied Gideon Spilett, without showing any enthusiasm; “provided one doesn’t eat too much”"
"“好，好！”水手回答道，每当他打回来的猎物得不到重视的时候，他就十分不悦。“你就喜欢对着干。要是在七个月以前，我们刚登陆这块小岛那会儿，你要是看到这样的猎物，一定要高兴坏了！”","“That’s right, that’s right,” returned the sailor, who was not pleased whenever he heard his chase made light of.“You like to make objections.Seven months ago, when we landed on the island, you would have been only too glad to have met with such game!”"
"“得了，得了，”记者回道，“人都是不完美的，而且永不满足。”","“Well, well,” replied the reporter, “man is never perfect, nor contented.”"
"“现在，”潘克洛夫说道，“我希望纳布拿出烹调的真本事来。看啊！这两只小猪还不到三个月大！它们一定像鹌鹑那样鲜嫩！快来啊，纳布，来啊！我也亲自来做做。”","“Now,” said Pencroft, “I hope that Neb will distinguish himself.Look here!These two little peccaries are not more than three months old!They will be as tender as quails!Come along, Neb, come!I will look after the cooking myself.”"
"水手跟着纳布进了厨房，他们很快就专心地烹调起来。","And the sailor, followed by Neb, entered the kitchen, where they were soon absorbed in their culinary labors."
"伙伴们同意他们按照自己的想法进行烹调。因而，纳布准备了一顿丰盛的晚餐——两只烤乳猪、袋鼠汤、熏火腿、南欧松子和大红香蜂草。事实上，这是他们所做的最好的食物了，但是在所有的食物中，最棒的还是美味的小猪。","They were allowed to do it in their own way.Neb, therefore, prepared a magnificent repast—the two little peccaries, kangaroo soup, a smoked ham, stone-pine almonds, Oswego tea; in fact, all the best that they had, but among all the dishes figured in the first rank the savory peccaries."
"五点钟的时候，他们在花岗石宫的餐厅开饭了。桌子上，袋鼠汤冒着热气。他们觉得味道十分可口。","At five o’clock dinner was served in the dining-room of Granite House.The kangaroo soup was smoking on the table.They found it excellent."
"喝完汤，他们开始吃烤乳猪了，潘克洛夫坚持要自己切，并且给每位伙伴都切了很大一块。","To the soup succeeded the peccaries, which Pencroft insisted on carving himself, and of which he served out monstrous portions to each of the guests."
"这些乳猪是在是太好吃了，潘克洛夫津津有味地大口咀嚼，突然，他大叫了一声，接着咒骂了一句。","These suckling-pigs were really delicious, and Pencroft was devouring his share with great gusto, when all at once a cry and an oath escaped him."
"“怎么了？”赛勒斯·哈丁问道。","“What’s the matter?” asked Cyrus Harding."
"“怎么了？我的牙齿刚被硌坏了一颗！”水手答道。","“The matter? the matter is that I have just broken a tooth!” replied the sailor."
"“什么，你的小猪里面有卵石吗？”吉丁·史佩莱问道。","“What, are there pebbles in your peccaries?” said Gideon Spilett."
"“我想是的。”潘克洛夫一边回答，一边从嘴中拿出那个硌坏他一颗牙齿的东西。","“I suppose so,” replied Pencroft, drawing from his lips the object which had cost him a grinder!—"
"那不是卵石，而是一颗铅弹。","It was not a pebble—it was a leaden bullet."
"第二部 孤岛求生","Part 2—Abandoned"
"第一章","Chapter 1"
"气球上的航行者流落到林肯岛上已有整整七个月了。这段时间，尽管他们也曾寻找调查，但并未发现岛上有其他人。岛上甚至没有一缕显示人类居住迹象的炊烟。也没有人类劳作的痕迹，以表明早期或是近段时间有人在此居住。除了他们，小岛上似乎没有其他人了，不仅如此，这群拓荒者也不得不相信小岛上从来不曾有人类居住过。然而现在，居然在一只无力伤害人的噬齿动物身上发现了一颗金属子弹，它推翻了所有推理。事实上，这颗子弹一定是由火器发射出来的，除了人类，还有谁会使用这样的武器呢？","It was now exactly seven months since the balloon voyagers had been thrown on Lincoln Island.During that time, notwithstanding the researches they had made, no human being had been discovered.No smoke even had betrayed the presence of man on the surface of the island.No vestiges of his handiwork showed that either at an early or at a late period had man lived there.Not only did it now appear to be uninhabited by any but themselves, but the colonists were compelled to believe that it never had been inhabited.And now, all this scaffolding of reasonings fell before a simple ball of metal, found in the body of an inoffensive rodent!In fact, this bullet must have issued from a firearm, and who but a human being could have used such a weapon?"
"当潘克洛夫将子弹放到桌上的时候，他的同伴们非常惊讶地盯着这颗子弹。虽然这颗子弹本身似乎微不足道，但这个时间却可能引发一系列后果，因而立即引起了他们的重视。他们此刻的惊讶程度，不亚于看到突发的超自然现象。","When Pencroft had placed the bullet on the table, his companions looked at it with intense astonishment.All the consequences likely to result from this incident, notwithstanding its apparent insignificance, immediately took possession of their minds.The sudden apparition of a supernatural being could not have startled them more completely."
"这件令人吃惊的突发事件当然引起了赛勒斯·哈丁的思考，他毫不犹豫地说出了内心的想法。他拿着这颗子弹，翻来覆去地看，子弹在他的拇指和食指间转动着，接着，他转向潘克洛夫，问道：","Cyrus Harding did not hesitate to give utterance to the suggestions which this fact, at once surprising and unexpected, could not fail to raise in his mind.He took the bullet, turned it over and over, rolled it between his finger and thumb; then, turning to Pencroft, he asked,—"
"“你确定被这颗子弹伤到的野猪不足三个月大吗？”","Are you sure that the peccary wounded by this bullet was not more than three months old?”"
"“是的，上尉，”潘克洛夫回答道，“我在陷阱里发现它的时候，它还在吃奶呢。”","“Not more, captain,” replied Pencroft.“It was still sucking its mother when I found it in the trap.”"
"“那么，”工程师说道，“这就说明在三个月内，有人在林肯岛上开过枪。”","“Well,” said the engineer, “that proves that within three months a gun-shot was fired in Lincoln Island.”"
"“而那颗子弹，”吉丁·史佩莱补充道，“打伤了这只小动物，虽然并没有杀死它。”","“And that a bullet,” added Gideon Spilett, “wounded, though not mortally, this little animal.”"
"“这毫无疑问，”赛勒斯·哈丁说道，“从这件事中我们可以推论：在我们到达之前曾有人在岛上居住过，或者他们是在最近三个月内登陆到这里。这些人是有意还是被迫来到这里的，是在海边登陆还是因为失事流落到这里的？这点只能留待以后解决了。至于他们是什么人，欧洲人还是马来西亚人，是我们种族的敌人还是朋友？我们可能无从得知；他们仍然居住在这个岛上，还是已经离开了，我们也不得而知。但是这些问题十分重要，亟待解决。”","“That is unquestionable,” said Cyrus Harding, “and these are the deductions which must be drawn from this incident: that the island was inhabited before our arrival, or that men have landed here within three months.Did these men arrive here voluntarily or involuntarily, by disembarking on the shore or by being wrecked?This point can only be cleared up later.As to what they were, Europeans or Malays, enemies or friends of our race, we cannot possibly guess; and if they still inhabit the island, or if they have left it, we know not.But these questions are of too much importance to be allowed to remain long unsettled.”"
"“不！这怎么可能！这绝对不可能！”水手从桌子边一跃而起，喊道，“林肯岛上除了我们不会再有其他人了！我保证！这个小岛不是很大，如果有人曾在这里居住过，我们早就该看到他们了！”","“No! a hundred times no! a thousand times no!” cried the sailor, springing up from the table.“There are no other men than ourselves on Lincoln Island!By my faith!The island isn’t large and if it had been inhabited, we should have seen some of the inhabitants long before this!”"
"“如果事实正好相反，那就太可怕了。”赫伯特说道。","“In fact, the contrary would be very astonishing,” said Herbert."
"“但是如果这只野猪出生的时候，身上就有子弹，”记者评论道，“那就更可怕了。”","“But it would be much more astonishing, I should think, observed the reporter, “if this peccary had been born with a bullet in its inside!”"
"“不管怎样，”纳布严肃地说道，“如果潘克洛夫没有——”","“At least,” said Neb seriously, “if Pencroft has not had—”"
"“听着，纳布，”潘克洛夫大叫道，“你觉得如果我下巴里有颗子弹，过了五六个月，我还能找不出来？它能藏在哪里？”他一边问一边张开嘴巴，给纳布看他嘴里的32颗牙齿。“看好了，纳布，如果你能在我嘴巴里找到一颗有窟窿的牙齿，我就让你拔掉六颗牙齿！”","“Look here, Neb,” burst out Pencroft.“Do you think I could have a bullet in my jaw for five or six months without finding it out?Where could it be hidden?” he asked, opening his mouth to show the two-and-thirty teeth with which it was furnished.“Look well, Neb, and if you find one hollow tooth in this set, I will let you pull out half a dozen!”"
"“纳布的猜测显然是不可能的，”哈丁回答道，尽管他陷入了沉思，还是禁不住微微一笑。“毫无疑问，最多在三个月前，有人在岛上开过枪。但是我倾向于认为，在海边登陆的这些人仅仅是不久前才来到这里，或者是刚到这里。因为如果他们确实住在这里，我们在富兰克林山顶俯瞰小岛的时候，就应该看到他们，或者他们应该看到我们。所以我认为，他们可能就是这几周内被风暴抛到海岸上来的。不管怎样，我们都应当把这点弄清楚，这很重要。”","“Neb’s supposition is certainly inadmissible,” replied Harding, who, notwithstanding the gravity of his thoughts, could not restrain a smile.“It is certain that a gun has been fired in the island, within three months at most.But I am inclined to think that the people who landed on this coast were only here a very short time ago, or that they just touched here; for if, when we surveyed the island from the summit of Mount Franklin, it had been inhabited, we should have seen them or we should have been seen ourselves.It is therefore, probable that within only a few weeks castaways have been thrown by a storm on some part of the coast.However that may be, it is of consequence to us to have this point settled.”"
"“我想我们应当小心行事。”记者说道。","“I think that we should act with caution,” said the reporter."
"“我的建议也是这样，”赛勒斯·哈丁回答道，“我担心有可能是马来的海盗在小岛上登陆了！”","“Such is my advice,” replied Cyrus Harding, “for it is to be feared that Malay pirates have landed on the island!”"
"“上尉，”水手问道，“在出发之前，我们先造一只小船，我们就能溯流而上，而且如果我们乐意，还可以在岛内沿线航行，这个计划不错吧？我们需要做些准备。”","“Captain,” asked the sailor, “would it not be a good plan, before setting out, to build a canoe in which we could either ascend the river, or, if we liked, coast round the inland?It will not do to be unprovided.”"
"“这是个好主意，潘克洛夫，”工程师回答道，“但是我们等不及了。建造一只小船至少要花费一个月的时间。”","“Your idea is good, Pencroft,” replied the engineer, “but we cannot wait for that.It would take at least a month to build a boat.”"
"“是的，造艘真正的船需要这么久，”水手答道，“但是我们并不需要那种能在海上航行的船，至多五天，我就能建造一只可以在慈悲河上航行的小舟了。”","“Yes, a real boat,” replied the sailor; “but we do not want one for a sea voyage, and in five days at the most, I will undertake to construct a canoe fit to navigate the Mercy.”"
"“五天，”纳布惊叫，“建造一只小船？”","“Five days,” cried Neb, “to build a boat?”"
"“没错，纳布，一只印第安式的小船。”","“Yes, Neb; a boat in the Indian fashion.”"
"“木头做的？”这个黑人问道，他看起来依然不相信。","“Of wood?” asked the Negro, looking still unconvinced."
"“木头做的，”潘克洛夫回答道，“更确切地说，是用树皮做。我再说一遍，上尉，五天之内一定会完工！”","“Of wood,” replied Pencroft, “of rather of bark.I repeat, captain, that in five days the work will be finished!”"
"“五天内，那好，动手吧。”工程师回答道。","“In five days, then, be it,” replied the engineer."
"“但是这段时间我们必须要小心警惕。”赫伯特说道。","“But till that time we must be very watchful,” said Herbert."
"“我们确实应当小心警惕，朋友们，”哈丁回答道，“还有，我希望你们把打猎范围限定在花岗石宫附近。”","“Very watchful indeed, my friends,” replied Harding; “and I beg you to confine your hunting excursions to the neighborhood of Granite House.”"
"晚餐就这样结束了，并没有像潘克洛夫希望的那样愉快。","The dinner ended less gaily than Pencroft had hoped."
"所以，除了这群居民外，还有其他人曾经或者正在岛上居住。正如这颗子弹的出现所证明的那样，此后这发现将成为一个不容置疑的事实，而这个发现使得拓荒者们深感不安。","So, then, the island was, or had been, inhabited by others than the settlers.Proved as it was by the incident of the bullet, it was hereafter an unquestionable fact, and such a discovery could not but cause great uneasiness among the colonists."
"赛勒斯·哈丁和吉丁·史佩莱睡前针对这件事情交谈了很长时间。他们问自己，这件事情会不会碰巧和工程师的不可解释的获救方式存在一些关联，以及和他们在不同时间发现的其他怪事有联系。但是，在对这个问题的正反两面进行讨论之后，赛勒斯·哈丁最后说道：","Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett, before sleeping, conversed long about the matter.They asked themselves if by chance this incident might not have some connection with the inexplicable way in which the engineer had been saved, and the other peculiar circumstances which had struck them at different times.However, Cyrus Harding, after having discussed the pros and cons of the question, ended by saying,—"
"“简单地说，你想知道我的想法吗，亲爱的史佩莱？”","“In short, would you like to know my opinion, my dear Spilett?”"
"“当然了，赛勒斯。”","“Yes, Cyrus.”"
"“好，那就是无论我们多么仔细地勘察这个小岛，我们还是会一无所获。”","“Well, then, it is this: however minutely we explore the island, we shall find nothing.”"
"第二天，潘克洛夫开始工作了。他并不打算建造一只有甲板和船舷的船，而只是一只足以在慈悲河上划行的平底小舟，毕竟只用到达水位本来就较浅的河流发源地。把一块块树皮固定在一起，就可以造出一只轻舟了，一旦遇到天然阻碍，搬运起来也是很轻便的。潘克洛夫打算用钉子把一块块树皮固定起来，确保小舟不会透水。","The next day Pencroft set to work.He did not mean to build a boat with boards and planking, but simply a flat-bottomed canoe, which would be well suited for navigating the Mercy—above all, for approaching its source, where the water would naturally be shallow.Pieces of bark, fastened one to the other, would form a light boat; and in case of natural obstacles, which would render a portage necessary, it would be easily carried.Pencroft intended to secure the pieces of bark by means of nails, to insure the canoe being water-tight."
"首先，要选择树皮结实而且柔韧性好的树木，以备造船之用。上一场暴风雪刮倒了许多高大的桦树，而桦树的树皮非常适合用来造船。有些树倒在地上，他们需要做的就是剥下树皮，但是因为居民们只有粗糙的工具，这项工作是最艰难的。然而，他们还是克服了所有困难。","It was first necessary to select the trees which would afford a strong and supple bark for the work.Now the last storm had brought down a number of large birch-trees, the bark of which would be perfectly suited for their purpose.Some of these trees lay on the ground, and they had only to be barked, which was the most difficult thing of all, owing to the imperfect tools which the settlers possessed.However, they overcame all difficulties."
"水手在工程师的帮助下，争分夺秒地工作，吉丁·史佩莱和赫伯特也没有闲着。","While the sailor, seconded by the engineer, thus occupied himself without losing an hour, Gideon Spilett and Herbert were not idle."
"他们忙着为大家供应食物。少年使用弓箭和矛的技术非常娴熟，记者不由得对这位少年产生了敬意。赫伯特还表现出了非凡的勇气和镇定自若的心态，这或许就可以称作是“智勇双全”。这两个狩猎的伙伴牢记赛勒斯·哈丁的建议，活动范围没有超出花岗石宫周围两英里之外。但是森林的边缘地区依然有大量的刺鼠、水豚、袋鼠、西貒等等，而且尽管陷阱捕获的猎物不如冬天的多，但是养兔场还是会像往常的数量一样供给食物，这或许就可以使林肯岛上的拓荒者们填饱肚子了。","They were made purveyors to the colony.The reporter could not but admire the boy, who had acquired great skill in handling the bow and spear.Herbert also showed great courage and much of that presence of mind which may justly be called “the reasoning of bravery.”These two companions of the chase, remembering Cyrus Harding’s recommendations, did not go beyond a radius of two miles round Granite House; but the borders of the forest furnished a sufficient tribute of agoutis, capybaras, kangaroos, peccaries, etc.; and if the result from the traps was less than during the cold, still the warren yielded its accustomed quota, which might have fed all the colony in Lincoln Island."
"打猎的时候，赫伯特经常会和吉丁·史佩莱谈论子弹的事情，以及工程师由此做出的推断。一天，也就是10月26日，郝伯特说道：“史佩莱先生，如果真的有落难者登陆到这个小岛上，而他们到现在为止还没有在花岗石宫附近出现过，你不觉得非常奇怪吗？”","Often during these excursions, Herbert talked with Gideon Spilett on the incident of the bullet, and the deductions which the engineer drew from it, and one day—it was the 26th of October—he said—“But, Mr. Spilett, do you not think it very extraordinary that, if any castaways have landed on the island, they have not yet shown themselves near Granite House?”"
"“如果他们还在这里，那确实很奇怪，”记者回答道，“但是如果他们已经不在这里了，那就不足为奇了！”","“Very astonishing if they are still here,” replied the reporter, “but not astonishing at all if they are here no longer!”"
"“那么，你认为这些人已经离开小岛了吗？”赫伯特又问道。","“So you think that these people have already quitted the island?” returned Herbert."
"“极有可能，孩子，如果他们在这里呆的时间长一点，尤其是如果他们还在这里，总会发生一些事情暴露他们的行踪。”","“It is more than probable, my boy; for if their stay was prolonged, and above all, if they were still here, some accident would have at last betrayed their presence.”"
"“但是如果他们有能力离开，”少年道，“那么他们就不会是落难者了。”","“But if they were able to go away,” observed the lad, “they could not have been castaways.”"
"“不，赫伯特，或许我们至少可以把他们称作是暂时的落难者。有可能是风暴驱使他们来到这座小岛上，但是他们的船只可能并没被摧毁，于是，风暴结束后，他们就离开了。”","“No, Herbert; or, at least, they were what might be called provisional castaways.It is very possible that a storm may have driven them to the island without destroying their vessel, and that, the storm over, they went away again.”"
"“我确信一件事情，”赫伯特说道，“哈丁上尉似乎害怕而不是希望岛上有其他人出现。”","“I must acknowledge one thing,” said Herbert, “it is that Captain Harding appears rather to fear than desire the presence of human beings on our island.”"
"“简单地说，”记者回答道，“只有马来人会经常光顾这些海域，而那些家伙都是暴徒，我们最好躲开他们。”","“In short,” responded the reporter, “there are only Malays who frequent these seas, and those fellows are ruffians which it is best to avoid.”"
"“这有可能，史佩莱先生，”赫伯特说道，“说不定哪天我们就会发现他们登陆的踪迹。”","“It is not impossible, Mr. Spilett,” said Herbert, “that some day or other we may find traces of their landing.”"
"“或许是吧，孩子。一个废弃的帐篷，一堆篝火的灰烬，都可以使我们有迹可循，这就是我们下次探险要寻找的东西。”","“I do not say no, my boy.A deserted camp, the ashes of a fire, would put us on the track, and this is what we will look for in our next expedition.”"
"那天，狩猎者们是在慈悲河附近的一片树林讲这番话的，那里有许多美丽的树木。在一些树木之间，地面矗立起几乎高达200英尺的树，有一些是高大的松柏树，新西兰的土著们把它们叫做卡利松。","The day on which the hunters spoke thus, they were in a part of the forest near the Mercy, remarkable for its beautiful trees.There, among others, rose, to a height of nearly 200 feet above the ground, some of those superb coniferae, to which, in New Zealand, the natives give the name of Kauris."
"“我想到一个办法，史佩莱先生，”赫伯特说道，“如果我爬到一棵卡利松树上面，就可以看到周围广阔的地方。”","“I have an idea, Mr. Spilett,” said Herbert.“If I were to climb to the top of one of these kauris, I could survey the country for an immense distance round.”"
"“这主意不错，”记者回答说，“可是你能爬到这些巨大的树上去吗？”","“The idea is good,” replied the reporter; “but could you climb to the top of those giants?”"
"“至少可以试一下。”赫伯特回答说。","“I can at least try,” replied Herbert."
"动作轻快敏捷的少年纵身一跳，跳到了离地面最近的那树枝上，树枝交错盘旋，爬上去很容易。几分钟后，他就到了树顶，树处在一望无际的翠绿平原中。","The light and active boy then sprang on the first branches, the arrangement of which made the ascent of the kauri easy, and in a few minutes he arrived at the summit, which emerged from the immense plain of verdure."
"从这个高度望过去，他可以看到整个小岛的南部地区，从东南的爪角到西南的爬虫角。西北方向耸立着富兰克林山，遮住了很大一部分视线。","From this elevated situation his gaze extended over all the southern portion of the island, from Claw Cape on the southeast, to Reptile End on the southwest.To the northwest rose Mount Franklin, which concealed a great part of the horizon."
"但是这个观测点的高度使得赫伯特可以看到小岛上所有未知区域，而这些地方或许就是踪迹被他们怀疑的陌生人的安身之处。","But Herbert, from the height of his observatory, could examine all the yet unknown portion of the island, which might have given shelter to the strangers whose presence they suspected."
"少年仔细地查看着。海上什么也没有，无论是在地平线上，还是在小岛附近，都没有发现船只。但是由于浅滩的树木遮住了海岸，或许有一只小船，特别是桅杆断掉的，可能在离陆地很近的地方停泊着，而郝伯特是没有办法看到的。","The lad looked attentively.There was nothing in sight on the sea, not a sail, neither on the horizon nor near the island.However, as the bank of trees hid the shore, it was possible that a vessel, especially if deprived of her masts, might lie close to the land and thus be invisible to Herbert."
"远西森林里也什么都看不到。森林里的树木形成了一道不可透视的屏障，绵延几平方英里，一处空隙或是开阔的地方也没有。甚至也没有办法顺着慈悲河的河道看过去，或是确定它的源头在山的哪一部分。或许还有其他的溪流也向西流去，但却看不到。","Neither in the forests of the Far West was anything to be seen.The wood formed an impenetrable screen, measuring several square miles, without a break or an opening.It was impossible even to follow the course of the Mercy, or to ascertain in what part of the mountain it took its source.Perhaps other creeks also ran towards the west, but they could not be seen."
"然而，即便是所有的宿营痕迹都逃过赫伯特的视线，难道他会瞥不见轻烟吗？在这样清朗的天气里，即便是一缕淡淡的轻烟也可以很轻易地看出来。","But at last, if all indication of an encampment escaped Herbert’s sight could he not even catch a glimpse of smoke, the faintest trace of which would be easily discernible in the pure atmosphere?"
"有那么一瞬间，赫伯特认为他看到西边有一缕淡淡的轻烟，但是再仔细看时发现他弄错了。他睁大眼睛，向四面八方望去，他的视力很好。但是没有，确实什么也没有。","For an instant Herbert thought he could perceive a slight smoke in the west, but a more attentive examination showed that he was mistaken.He strained his eyes in every direction, and his sight was excellent.No, decidedly there was nothing there."
"赫伯特从卡利松上下来，这两个猎人又返回花岗石宫去了。赛勒斯·哈丁听少年的讲述后，摇了摇头，什么都没有说。很明显，在没有彻底勘察这个小岛之前，在这个问题上是不能下定论的。","Herbert descended to the foot of the kauri, and the two sportsmen returned to Granite House.There Cyrus Harding listened to the lad’s account, shook his head and said nothing.It was very evident that no decided opinion could be pronounced on this question until after a complete exploration of the island."
"两天之后，也就是10月28日，又发生了一件事，同样需要对它的解释。","Two days after—the 28th of October—another incident occurred, for which an explanation was again required."
"赫伯特和纳布在距花岗石宫两英里的海边散步的时，很幸运地捉住了一只美丽的龟目动物。这是一只可食用的迈达斯种海龟，这是可食用的绿海龟，所以这样叫它是因为它的壳和肉都是绿色的。","While strolling along the shore about two miles from Granite House, Herbert and Neb were fortunate enough to capture a magnificent specimen of the order of chelonia.It was a turtle of the species Midas, the edible green turtle, so called from the color both of its shell and fat."
"这只海龟在岩石间朝着大海的方向爬动的时候，被赫伯特看到了。","Herbert caught sight of this turtle as it was crawling among the rocks to reach the sea."
"“快来帮忙，纳布，快来！”他喊道。","“Help, Neb, help!” he cried."
"纳布跑了过来。","Neb ran up."
"“多美的动物啊！”纳布说道，“但是我们要怎么捉住它呀？”","“What a fine animal!” said Neb; “but how are we to catch it?”"
"“没有比这更容易的了，纳布，”赫伯特回答道，“我们只需要把这只海龟翻过来，它就跑不了了。拿起你的矛，跟着我做。”","“Nothing is easier, Neb,” replied Herbert.“We have only to turn the turtle on its back, and it cannot possibly get away.Take your spear and do as I do.”"
"这只爬虫发觉到了危险，把身体缩进了龟壳和腹甲之间。他们就看不到这只海龟的头和脚了，而海龟像块岩石一样一动也不动。","The reptile, aware of danger, had retired between its carapace and plastron.They no longer saw its head or feet, and it was motionless as a rock."
"赫伯特和纳布就把棍子伸到这只动物的身下，一起用力，很轻易地就把它翻了过来。这只海龟长达三英尺，至少有400磅重。","Herbert and Neb then drove their sticks underneath the animal, and by their united efforts managed without difficulty to turn it on its back.The turtle, which was three feet in length, would have weighed at least four hundred pounds."
"“太好了！”纳布喊道，“这就是能使我们的朋友潘克洛夫高兴的东西。”","“Capital!” cried Neb; “this is something which will rejoice friend Pencroft’s heart.”"
"事实上，潘克洛夫一定会很开心，因为这种海龟以海草为食，龟肉味道极其鲜美。这时，海龟伸出头来，又小又扁，但是由于隐藏在长长的上颚骨下巨大的、临时的颞窝，头的后部则比较宽。","In fact, the heart of friend Pencroft could not fail to be rejoiced, for the flesh of the turtle, which feeds on wrack-grass, is extremely savory.At this moment the creature’s head could be seen, which was small, flat, but widened behind by the large temporal fossae hidden under the long roof."
"“现在要怎么处理我们的战利品呢？”纳布说道，“我们不能把它拖回花岗石宫啊！”","“And now, what shall we do with our prize?” said Neb.“We can’t drag it to Granite House!”"
"“既然它不会翻身，就把它留在这里吧，”赫伯特回答道，“我们回去把推车弄来拉走它。”","“Leave it here, since it cannot turn over,” replied Herbert, “and we will come back with the cart to fetch it.”"
"“这个最好的办法。”","“That is the best plan.”"
"但是为谨慎起见，赫伯特又不厌其烦地用大石头把这只海龟挡住，纳布则认为没有必要这样做。之后，两个猎人就沿着退潮之后显现出来的海滩，回到了花岗石宫。赫伯特想给潘克洛夫一个惊喜，因而对他们在沙滩上翻过来的那只“超级大海龟”只字未提。两个小时之后，他和纳布带着推车回到他们留下海龟的地方。那只“超级大海龟”却不见了！","However, for greater precaution, Herbert took the trouble, which Neb deemed superfluous, to wedge up the animal with great stones; after which the two hunters returned to Granite House, following the beach, which the tide had left uncovered.Herbert, wishing to surprise Pencroft, said nothing about the “superb specimen of a chelonian” which they had turned over on the sand; but, two hours later, he and Neb returned with the cart to the place where they had left it.The “superb specimen of a chelonian” was no longer there!"
"纳布和赫伯特面面相觑，接着他们又仔细看了看周围。海龟就是被留在这里的。少年甚至还找到了他刚用过的石头，因而确信没有弄错。","Neb and Herbert stared at each other first; then they stared about them.It was just at this spot that the turtle had been left.The lad even found the stones which he had used, and therefore he was certain of not being mistaken."
"“嗯！”纳布说道，“海龟自己就能翻过身来，对吧？”","“Well!” said Neb, “these beasts can turn themselves over, then?’’"
"“看起来是这样。”赫伯特回答道，他盯着散落在沙子上的石头，根本无法理解这一切。","“It appears so,” replied Herbert, who could not understand it at all, and was gazing at the stones scattered on the sand."
"“哎，潘克洛夫要不开心了！”","“Well, Pencroft will be disgusted!”"
"“哈丁上尉如果知道了，或许会觉得海龟的消失很困惑。”赫伯特想道。","“And Captain Harding will perhaps be very perplexed how to explain this disappearance,” thought Herbert."
"“听着，”纳布说道，他不想要别人知道这种不幸，“我们不要提起这件事了。”","“Look here,” said Neb, who wished to hide his ill-luck, “we won’t speak about it.”"
"“恰恰相反，纳布，我们必须把这件事告诉大家。”赫伯特回答道。","“On the contrary, Neb, we must speak about it,” replied Herbert."
"两人又推着没有派上用场的推车，回到了花岗石宫。","And the two, taking the cart, which there was now no use for, returned to Granite House."
"他们走到工程师和水手在一起造船的地方，赫伯特叙述了刚才发生的事。","Arrived at the dockyard, where the engineer and the sailor were working together, Herbert recounted what had happened."
"“哎呀！两个傻瓜！”水手喊道，“就这样让至少50顿饭溜走了！”","“Oh! the stupids!” cried the sailor, “to have let at least fifty meals escape!”"
"“但是，潘克洛夫，”纳布回答道，“海龟不见了不是我们的错，我告诉过你了，我们把它翻过来了啊！”","“But, Pencroft,” replied Neb, “it wasn’t our fault that the beast got away; as I tell you, we had turned it over on its back!”"
"“那么你们还是翻得不够彻底！”倔强的水手说道。","“Then you didn’t turn it over enough!” returned the obstinate sailor."
"“不够彻底！”赫伯特喊道。","“Not enough!” cried Herbert."
"他于是又讲了是如何小心地翼翼用石头把海龟挡住。","And he told how he had taken care to wedge up the turtle with stones."
"“那就奇怪了！”潘克洛夫回答说。","“It is a miracle, then!” replied Pencroft."
"“上尉，我认为，”赫伯特说道，“海龟要是四爪朝天，是翻不过身的，尤其是那种大海龟，对吗？”","“I thought, captain,” said Herbert, “that turtles, once placed on their backs, could not regain their feet, especially when they are of a large size?’"
"“是的，孩子。”赛勒斯·哈丁回答道。","“That is true, my boy,” replied Cyrus Harding."
"“那它是怎么跑掉的？”","“Then how did it manage?”"
"“你们放海龟的地方距离大海有多远？”工程师问道，他停下了手中的活，仔细考虑这件事情。","“At what distance from the sea did you leave this turtle?” asked the engineer, who, having suspended his work, was reflecting on this incident."
"“最多有15英尺。”赫伯特回答道。","“Fifteen feet at the most,” replied Herbert."
"“当时潮水很低吗？”","“And the tide was low at the time?”"
"“是的，上尉。”","“Yes, captain.”"
"“那么，”工程师回答道，“海龟在沙滩上翻不了身，或许在水里就可以了。当潮水冲到它的时候，它翻过来身，然后就静悄悄地游回深海了。”","“Well,” replied the engineer, “what the turtle could not do on the sand it might have been able to do in the water.It turned over when the tide overtook it, and then quietly returned to the deep sea.”"
"“哎呀！我们真是傻瓜！”纳布喊道。","“Oh! what stupids we were!” cried Neb."
"“我刚才有幸就是这样说的！”水手回敬道。","“That is precisely what I had the honor of telling you before!” returned the sailor."
"赛勒斯·哈丁作出的解释无疑是可以接受的。但是他自己相信这个解释的准确性吗？可能他不相信。","Cyrus Harding had given this explanation, which, no doubt, was admissible.But was he himself convinced of the accuracy of this explanation?It cannot be said that he was."
"第二章","Chapter 2"
"10月9日那天，用树皮做的小舟完全造好了。潘克洛夫没有食言，在五天之内建造出了一只轻舟，舟体由克莱金巴树柔韧的枝条连结在一起而成。这只小舟长12英尺，重量不超过200磅。船首和船尾各有一个座位，船的中间也有一个座位以保持平衡，船上还有用来放置双桨的桨架以及掌舵的橹，这些就是船的全部。小舟的下水操作也极其简单。他们将小舟运到海边，放在花岗石宫前的沙滩上，涨潮的海水就使得小舟浮了起来。潘克洛夫立即跳进小舟里，用橹灵活地驾驶着，并宣称这只小舟正好可以满足他们的需要。","On the 9th of October the bark canoe was entirely finished.Pencroft had kept his promise, and a light boat, the shell of which was joined together by the flexible twigs of the crejimba, had been constructed in five days.A seat in the stern, a second seat in the middle to preserve the equilibrium, a third seat in the bows, rowlocks for the two oars, a scull to steer with, completed the little craft, which was twelve feet long, and did not weigh more than two hundred pounds.The operation of launching it was extremely simple.The canoe was carried to the beach and laid on the sand before Granite House, and the rising tide floated it.Pencroft, who leaped in directly, maneuvered it with the scull and declared it to be just the thing for the purpose to which they wished to put it."
"“哈哈！”水手高喊，他毫不避讳地炫耀自己的成功，“有了它，我们就可以环游——”","“Hurrah!” cried the sailor, who did not disdain to celebrate thus his own triumph.“With this we could go round—”"
"“世界？”吉丁·史佩莱问道。","“The world?” asked Gideon Spilett."
"“不，是海岛。找一些石头做压舱物，竖一根桅杆，上尉以后为我们再做一面帆，我们就可以整装待发了！现在，上尉，还有你，史佩莱先生，还有你，赫伯特，还有你，纳布，你们不过来试试我们的新船吗？快来！我们得看一下能不能载动我们五个人！”","“No, the island.Some stones for ballast, a mast and a sail, which the captain will make for us some day, and we shall go splendidly!Well, captain—and you, Mr. Spilett; and you, Herbert; and you, Neb—aren’t you coming to try our new vessel?Come along! we must see if it will carry all five of us!”"
"这确实应当试一下。潘克洛夫立马就通过岩石间一个狭窄的通道将小舟带回岸边，当天大家一致同意应当试一试这只小船，沿着海岸，划行至第一个海角，即南边岩石的尽头处。","This was certainly a trial which ought to be made.Pencroft soon brought the canoe to the shore by a narrow passage among the rocks, and it was agreed that they should make a trial of the boat that day by following the shore as far as the first point at which the rocks of the south ended."
"他们刚一上船，纳布就喊道：","As they embarked, Neb cried,—"
"“你的船有点漏水啊，潘克洛夫。”","“But your boat leaks rather, Pencroft.”"
"“没事的，纳布，”水手回答道，“木头会干的。两天后就一条裂缝都没有了，我们船里的水就会比酒鬼胃里的水还少。快跳进来！”","“That’s nothing, Neb,” replied the sailor; “the wood will get seasoned.In two days there won’t be a single leak, and our boat will have no more water in her than there is in the stomach of a drunkard.Jump in!”"
"他们很快就坐好了，然后潘克洛夫就开船了。天气很好，大海上风平浪静，海水像湖中狭窄区域中的湖水一样平静。因此。小船得以平稳地航行，就像是顺着慈悲河平静的水流划行一样。","They were soon all seated, and Pencroft shoved off.The weather was magnificent, the sea as calm as if its waters were contained within the narrow limits of a lake.Thus the boat could proceed with as much security as if it was ascending the tranquil current of the Mercy."
"纳布和赫伯特各拿着一支桨，而潘克洛夫则留在船尾摇橹。","Neb took one of the oars, Herbert the other, and Pencroft remained in the stern in order to use the scull."
"水手先是穿过海峡，接着就驶向小岛南部的海角。这时，一阵微风从南边吹来。但是，海峡里和碧蓝的大海上并未掀起滚滚的波涛。由于小船载重量较高，他们几乎感觉不到船下起伏的波浪，小船就在水面上平稳地划行着。他们在离海岸大约半英里的地方停了下来，在那里可以好好地欣赏富兰克林山。","The sailor first crossed the channel, and steered close to the southern point of the islet.A light breeze blew from the south.No roughness was found either in the channel or the green sea.A long swell, which the canoe scarcely felt, as it was heavily laden, rolled regularly over the surface of the water.They pulled out about half a mile distant from the shore, that they might have a good view of Mount Franklin."
"过了一会，潘克洛夫又将小船驶回了河口。接着，小船就沿着海岸行驶，海岸一直延伸到尽头的海角，潦凫沼泽都被遮没了。","Pencroft afterwards returned towards the mouth of the river.The boat then skirted the shore, which, extending to the extreme point, hid all Tadorn’s Fens."
"由于海岸线不规则，从慈悲河到海角的距离增加了，将近三英里。居民们决定划到海角的尽头处，如果需要，还可能再远一点，以便能够快速地观察一下远至爪角的海滨。","This point, of which the distance was increased by the irregularity of the coast, was nearly three miles from the Mercy.The settlers resolved to go to its extremity, and only go beyond it as much as was necessary to take a rapid survey of the coast as far as Claw Cape."
"小舟曲折的海岸划行，避开暗礁，涨潮的海水已经开始淹没这些礁石。海崖从河口到海角渐渐地倾斜下来。它是由花岗石形成的，花岗石散乱地分布着，与眺望岗的峭壁有很大的不同，非常荒凉。看上去好像上面大量的岩石都被开采空了。这个陡峭的海角寸草不生，从森林里突出来两英尺远，就像是从一只枝繁叶茂的袖子里伸出来的巨人的手臂。","The canoe followed the windings of the shore, avoiding the rocks which fringed it, and which the rising tide began to cover.The cliff gradually sloped away from the mouth of the river to the point.This was formed of granite reeks, capriciously distributed, very different from the cliff at Prospect Heights, and of an extremely wild aspect.It might have been said that an immense cartload of rocks had been emptied out there.There was no vegetation on this sharp promontory, which projected two miles from the forest, and it thus represented a giant’s arm stretched out from a leafy sleeve."
"在两只桨的划动下，小舟轻快无阻地前进着。吉丁·史佩莱一只手握着铅笔，另一只手拿着笔记本，用粗线条把海岸的轮廓勾勒了出来。纳布、赫伯特和潘克洛夫一边闲聊，一边查看着对于他们全新的这一部分领地，随着小舟往南划行，两个颚骨角似乎也动了起来，把联合湾包围地更紧了。","The canoe, impelled by the two oars, advanced without difficulty.Gideon Spilett, pencil in one hand and notebook in the other, sketched the coast in bold strokes.Neb, Herbert, and Pencroft chatted, while examining this part of their domain, which was new to them, and, in proportion as the canoe proceeded towards the south, the two Mandible Capes appeared to move, and surround Union Bay more closely."
"赛勒斯·哈丁则一言不发，只是凝视着四周，表情充满疑虑，仿佛是在观察一个陌生的地方。","As to Cyrus Harding, he did not speak; he simply gazed, and by the mistrust which his look expressed, it appeared that he was examining some strange country."
"在这段时间，小船划行了45分钟后到达了海角的尽头，潘克洛夫正准备返航的时候，赫伯特起身指着一个黑色的东西，说道：","In the meantime, after a voyage of three-quarters of an hour, the canoe reached the extremity of the point, and Pencroft was preparing to return, when Herbert, rising, pointed to a black object, saying,—"
"“海滩那里是什么？”","“What do I see down there on the beach?”"
"大家都向他指的地方看过去。","All eyes turned towards the point indicated."
"“哎呀，”记者道，“那里是有个东西。像是一只沉船的残骸，有一半被埋在沙滩里了。”","“Why,” said the reporter, “there is something.It looks like part of a wreck half buried in the sand.”"
"“啊！”潘克洛夫叫道，“我知道是什么了！”","“Ah!” cried Pencroft, “I see what it is!”"
"“什么？”纳布问道。","“What?” asked Neb."
"“桶，桶，或许里面还装满东西了。”水手答道。","“Barrels, barrels, which perhaps are full,” replied the sailor."
"“靠岸，潘克洛夫！”赛勒斯道。","“Pull to the shore, Pencroft!” said Cyrus."
"他们划了几下桨，把小舟驶入一条小河里，然后就跳上了岸。","A few strokes of the oar brought the canoe into a little creek, and its passengers leaped on shore."
"潘克洛夫说得没错。那里果然有两只桶，半截埋在沙里，和一只大箱子紧紧地拴在一起，在搁浅之前曾借助桶的浮力支撑漂浮在水面上。","Pencroft was not mistaken.Two barrels were there, half buried in the sand, but still firmly attached to a large chest, which, sustained by them, had floated to the moment when it stranded on the beach."
"“那说明一只船在小岛的某个地方遇难了。”赫伯特说道。","“There has been a wreck, then, in some part of the island,” said Herbert."
"“很明显。”史佩莱回答道。","“Evidently,” replied Spilett."
"“但是箱子里是什么呢？”潘克洛夫大叫，像往常一样焦躁不安。“箱子里是什么？箱子锁着，没办法打开啊！嗯，或许可以用石头。”","“But what’s in this chest?” cried Pencroft, with very natural impatience.“What’s in this chest?It is shut up, and nothing to open it with!Well, perhaps a stone—”"
"接着，水手就举起了一块重重的石头，正要准备朝箱子的一边砸去，工程师一把抓住了他的手。","And the sailor, raising a heavy block, was about to break in one of the sides of the chest, when the engineer arrested his hand."
"“潘克洛夫，”他说道，“你能再忍耐一个小时吗？”","“Pencroft,” said he, “can you restrain your impatience for one hour only?”"
"“但是，上尉，想想吧！或许里面有我们想要的所有东西呢！”","“But, captain, just think!Perhaps there is everything we want in there!”"
"“我们一会儿会弄明白的，潘克洛夫，”工程师回答道，“但是相信我，不要砸坏这只箱子，这或许会对我们有用。我们必须把它运回花岗石宫，在那里我们可以轻易地把它打开，并且不会损坏它。这只箱子完全可以被带回去,既然它能漂到这里，应该也可以漂回河口。”","“We shall find that out, Pencroft,” replied the engineer; “but trust to me, and do not break the chest, which may be useful to us.We must convey it to Granite House, where we can open it easily, and without breaking it.It is quite prepared for a voyage; and since it has floated here, it may just as well float to the mouth of the river.”"
"“你说得对,上尉，我又错了。”水手答道。","“You are right, captain, and I was wrong, as usual,” replied the sailor."
"工程师的建议很正确。事实上，小舟可能载不动箱子里或许会有的东西，因为箱子需要借助两个空桶才能浮起来，它无疑是很重的。因而通过水的浮力把它拖回到花岗石宫前的海滩上，不失为一个更好的办法。","The engineer’s advice was good.In fact, the canoe probably would not have been able to contain the articles possibly enclosed in the chest, which doubtless was heavy, since two empty barrels were required to buoy it up.It was, therefore, much better to tow it to the beach at Granite House."
"那么现在的问题是，这只箱子是从哪里来的呢？这个问题很重要。赛勒斯·哈丁和同伴们仔细地看了看周围，又查看了几百步外的海岸，并没有发现失事船只的其他物品或是碎片。赫伯特和纳布爬上一块高高的岩石，向海上望过去，但是什么也没有，既没有折断桅杆的大船，也没有扬帆的航船。","And now, whence had this chest come?That was the important question.Cyrus Harding and his companions looked attentively around them, and examined the shore for several hundred steps.No other articles or pieces of wreck could be found.Herbert and Neb climbed a high rock to survey the sea, but there was nothing in sight—neither a dismasted vessel nor a ship under sail."
"但是，确定无疑的是有船只失事。或许这件事和子弹有联系？或许是有陌生人在小岛的其他什么地方登陆了？或许他们仍旧居住在那里？但是居民们不约而同都想到的一点，这些陌生人不可能是马来海盗，因为箱子很明显是美国或欧洲制造的。","However, there was no doubt that there had been a wreck.Perhaps this incident was connected with that of the bullet?Perhaps strangers had landed on another part of the island?Perhaps they were still there?But the thought which came naturally to the settlers was, that these strangers could not be Malay pirates, for the chest was evidently of American or European make."
"大家都回到箱子旁，它异乎寻常地大。箱子是橡木做的，盖子紧紧地合着，外面用厚厚的皮革裹着，并且还用了铜钉加固。两只大桶也密封着，但是听起来，桶是空心的，并且里面没有东西。这两只桶被粗绳子绑到箱子的两边，绳结系的很有技巧，潘克洛夫一看就说这只有水手能做。箱子看起来保存得很完好，因为它是在沙滩上搁浅的，而不是在礁石堆中。不管怎样，他们经过仔细查看可以确定，这只箱子并没有在水里漂流很久，应该是最近才浮到这个海岸上来的。看上去箱子里面并没有进水，里面的东西也无疑是完好无损的。","All the party returned to the chest, which was of an unusually large size.It was made of oak wood, very carefully closed and covered with a thick hide, which was secured by copper nails.The two great barrels, hermetically sealed, but which sounded hollow and empty, were fastened to its sides by strong ropes, knotted with a skill which Pencroft directly pronounced sailors alone could exhibit.It appeared to be in a perfect state of preservation, which was explained by the fact that it had stranded on a sandy beach, and not among rocks.They had no doubt whatever, on examining it carefully, that it had not been long in the water, and that its arrival on this coast was recent.The water did not appear to have penetrated to the inside, and the articles which it contained were no doubt uninjured."
"很明显，一只断了桅杆的船在靠近这座小岛时，抛出来了这只箱子。船上的人小心翼翼地用这种漂浮装置使箱子在水中可以浮起来，希望它能漂到陆地上，他们稍后可以找回它。","It was evident that this chest had been thrown overboard from some dismasted vessel driven towards the island, and that, in the hope that it would reach the land, where they might afterwards find it, the passengers had taken the precaution to buoy it up by means of this floating apparatus."
"“我们一会儿就把这只箱子拖回花岗石宫，”工程师道，“回去后，我们可以清点一下里面的东西，如果我们找到可能失事的船只上的生还者，我们就把箱子还给他们。如果找不到人。”","“We will tow this chest to Granite House,” said the engineer, “where we can make an inventory of its contents; then, if we discover any of the survivors from the supposed wreck, we can return it to those to whom it belongs.If we find no one—”"
"“那我们就自己留着！”潘克洛夫喊道，“但是里面究竟会有什么？”","“We will keep it for ourselves!” cried Pencroft.“But what in the world can there be in it?”"
"海水已经拍打到这个箱子了，上涨的潮水无疑会使这个箱子浮起来。他们解开了绑在桶上的一部分绳子，把当作锚链把漂浮装置和小舟系到一起。接着，潘克洛夫和纳布用桨把箱子周围的沙土挖开，方便箱子移动，小船拖着箱子很快就从这个海角拐了回去，他们把这个海角叫做“遗物角”。","The sea was already approaching the chest, and the high tide would evidently float it.One of the ropes which fastened the barrels was partly unlashed and used as a cable to unite the floating apparatus with the canoe.Pencroft and Neb then dug away the sand with their oars, so as to facilitate the moving of the chest, towing which the boat soon began to double the point, to which the name of Flotsam Point was given."
"箱子很重，在两只桶的作用下，勉强可以浮出水面。水手也时刻担心，绳结如果松开了，箱子就会沉入海底。但很幸运，他担心的事情并没有发生，他们出发后航行了一个半小时，这段时间里他们都用在划行三英里上，小船就在花岗石宫下面的海岸边了。","The chest was heavy, and the barrels were scarcely sufficient to keep it above water.The sailor also feared every instant that it would get loose and sink to the bottom of the sea.But happily his fears were not realized, and an hour and a half after they set out—all that time had been taken up in going a distance of three miles—the boat touched the beach below Granite House."
"他们把小舟和箱子拉到沙滩上，当时正值退潮，他们所处的位置就相对较高并且很干爽。纳布则匆匆跑回家，取来一些打开箱子的工具，以尽可能把损害程度降低到最小，然后他们就可以开始清点里面的东西了。潘克洛夫则丝毫不掩饰他极度兴奋的心情。","Canoe and chest were then hauled up on the sands; and as the tide was then going out, they were soon left high and dry.Neb, hurrying home, brought back some tools with which to open the chest in such a way that it might be injured as little as possible, and they proceeded to its inventory.Pencroft did not try to hide that he was greatly excited."
"水手首先把两只桶卸了下来，它们还很完好，以后肯定派得上用场。然后水手就用冷凿和锤子强行把锁打开，盖子翻开了。箱子内壁还附有一层锌皮，这样设置很明显是为了防止里面的东西受潮。","The sailor began by detaching the two barrels, which, being in good condition, would of course be of use.Then the locks were forced with a cold chisel and hammer, and the lid thrown back.A second casing of zinc lined the interior of the chest, which had been evidently arranged that the articles which it enclosed might under any circumstances be sheltered from damp."
"“哦！”纳布叫道，“希望是果酱！”","“Oh!” cried Neb, “suppose it’s jam!"
"“我倒希望不是。”记者回答道。","“I hope not,” replied the reporter."
"“如果是——”水手小声说道。","“If only there was—” said the sailor in a low voice."
"纳布无意中听到了，就问：“什么？”","“What?” asked Neb, who overheard him."
"“没有什么！”","“Nothing!”"
"他们把锌皮撕掉，扔到箱子的一边，依次从中拿出大量各种各样的东西，散放到沙滩上。每拿出一样新东西，潘克洛夫都会欢呼雀跃，赫伯特则在一边拍手，纳布也高兴地手舞足蹈。里面有几本书，赫伯特看到之后欣喜若狂，而纳布则拿着箱子里面的厨具狂吻了起来！","The covering of zinc was torn off and thrown back over the sides of the chest, and by degrees numerous articles of very varied character were produced and strewn about on the sand.At each new object Pencroft uttered fresh hurrahs, Herbert clapped his hands, and Neb danced up and down.There were books which made Herbert wild with joy, and cooking utensils which Neb covered with kisses!"
"简而言之，拓荒者们非常满意，因为这只箱子里面工具、武器、仪器、衣服、书籍应有尽有。下面就是吉丁·史佩莱在笔记本中列出的清单：","In short, the colonists had reason to be extremely satisfied, for this chest contained tools, weapons, instruments, clothes, books; and this is the exact list of them as stated in Gideon Spilett’s note-book:"
"工具：三把多刃小刀、两把砍柴的斧头、两把木匠用的短柄小斧头、三个刨子、两个锛子、一把镰刀或鹤嘴锄、六只凿子、两把锉刀、三把锤子、三把螺丝锥、两把螺丝钻、十袋钉子和螺丝、三把不同尺寸的锯子、两盒针。","—Tools:—3 knives with several blades, 2 woodmen’s axes, 2 carpenter’s hatchets, 3 planes, 2 adzes, 1 twibil or mattock, 6 chisels, 2 files, 3 hammers, 3 gimlets, 2 augers, 10 bags of nails and screws, 3 saws of different sizes, 2 boxes of needles."
"武器：两只燧火枪、两根雷管、两支后膛卡宾枪、五柄木制短剑、四把军刀、两桶火药（每桶有25磅重）、14盒雷管。","Weapons:—2 flint-lock guns, 2 for percussion caps, 2 breach-loader carbines, 5 boarding cutlasses, 4 sabers, 2 barrels of powder, each containing twenty-five pounds; 12 boxes of percussion caps."
"仪器：一个六分仪，一副双筒望远镜，一副单筒望远镜，一盒数学仪器，一个水手指南针，一只华氏温度计，一只无液气压机，一只装有照相器材、物镜、感光板和化学品等的盒子。","Instruments:—1 sextant, 1 double opera-glass, 1 telescope, 1 box of mathematical instruments, 1 mariner’s compass, 1 Fahrenheit thermometer, 1 aneroid barometer, 1 box containing a photographic apparatus, object-glass, plates, chemicals, etc."
"衣服：两打衬衫，材质很特别，类似羊毛，但实际上是植物纤维；三打同样材质的袜子。","Clothes:—2 dozen shirts of a peculiar material resembling wool, but evidently of a vegetable origin; 3 dozen stockings of the same material."
"器皿：一只铁罐、六只铜制炖锅、三只铁盘、十件金属餐具、两只水壶、一只便携式火炉、六把餐刀。","Utensils:—1 iron pot, 6 copper saucepans, 3 iron dishes, 10 metal plates, 2 kettles, 1 portable stove, 6 table-knives,"
"书籍：一本《圣经》、一本地图册、一本有不同波利尼西亚习语的词典、一本自然科学词典（共六册）、三令白纸、两本空白的簿册。","Books:—1 Bible, 1 atlas, 1 dictionary of the different Polynesian idioms, 1 dictionary of natural science, in six volumes; 3 reams of white paper, 2 books with blank pages."
"“依我看来，”记者在清点完所有的物品后说道，“这个箱子的主人十分讲究实际！工具、武器、仪器、衣服、器皿、书籍应有尽有！或许真的可以这样讲，他预料到会出事，而且事先已经准备好了。”","“It must be allowed,” said the reporter, after the inventory had been made, “that the owner of this chest was a practical man!Tools, weapons, instruments, clothes, utensils, books—nothing is wanting!It might really be said that he expected to be wrecked, and had prepared for it beforehand.”"
"“确实是应有尽有。”赛勒斯·哈丁满腹心事地咕哝道。","“Nothing is wanting, indeed,” murmured Cyrus Harding thoughtfully."
"“我们可以肯定的是，”赫伯特补充道，“盛载这只箱子的船只不是马来西亚海盗的！”","“And for a certainty,” added Herbert, “the vessel which carried this chest and its owner was not a Malay pirate!”"
"“除非，”潘克洛夫说道，“船的主人已经被海盗抓走了。”","“Unless,” said Pencroft, “the owner had been taken prisoner by pirates—”"
"“那是不可能的，”记者回答道，“更大的可能是，一艘来自美国或欧洲的船只行驶到被迫进入这片区域，船上的乘客希望至少保留一些必需品，就准备了这只箱子，又把它抛下了水。”","“That is not admissible,” replied the reporter.“It is more probable that an American or European vessel has been driven into this quarter, and that her passengers, wishing to save necessaries at least, prepared this chest and threw it overboard.”"
"“你是这样的看法吗，上尉？”赫伯特问道。","“Is that your opinion, captain?” asked Herbert."
"“是的，孩子，”工程师回答道，“事情或许就是这样的。可能失事的时候，或是他们预料到会出事的时候，把各种最有用的物品收集到这只箱子里，希望以后可以在岸上找到它。”","“Yes, my boy,” replied the engineer, “that may have been the case.It is possible that at the moment, or in expectation of a wreck, they collected into this chest different articles of the greatest use in hopes of finding it again on the coast—”"
"“甚至包括照相器材！”水手喊道，他并不信服。","“Even the photographic box!” exclaimed the sailor incredulously."
"“至于那套器材，”哈丁回答道，“我不是很明白它有什么用，对于我们以及其他落难者来说，更加充足的衣物或是大量的弹药才是更有价值的啊！”","“As to that apparatus,” replied Harding, “I do not quite see the use of it; and a more complete supply of clothes or more abundant ammunition would have been more valuable to us as well as to any other castaways!”"
"“这些仪器、工具或是书籍上有没有什么记号或是指示，能给我们说明这一点？”吉丁·史佩莱问道。","“But isn’t there any mark or direction on these instruments, tools, or books, which would tell us something about them?” asked Gideon Spilett."
"这点可以证实一下。他们仔细查看了每件物品，尤其是书籍、仪器和武器。与一般的武器和仪器不同，这些都没有标明制造商。而且，这些武器和仪器都保存得十分完好，看起来像是从未用过的。工具和器皿也是一样，所有的都是崭新的，这就说明这些东西并不是被随机选中，然后扔进箱子里的。相反，这些东西是经过精挑细选，小心放置的。箱子里面防潮的锌皮层也可以说明这一点，这层锌皮是不可能在匆忙之中焊接好的。","That might be ascertained.Each article was carefully examined, especially the books, instruments and weapons.Neither the weapons nor the instruments, contrary to the usual custom, bore the name of the maker; they were, besides, in a perfect state, and did not appear to have been used.The same peculiarity marked the tools and utensils; all were new, which proved that the articles had not been taken by chance and thrown into the chest, but, on the contrary, that the choice of things had been well considered and arranged with care.This was also indicated by the second case of metal which had preserved them from damp, and which could not have been soldered in a moment of haste."
"自然科学和波利尼西亚习语词典都是英文的，但是上面既没有出版商的名字，也没有出版日期。","As to the dictionaries of natural science and Polynesian idioms, both were English; but they neither bore the name of the publisher nor the date of publication."
"圣经也是英文版的，四开本，印刷精美，并且看上去像是被经常翻阅的。","The same with the Bible printed in English, in quarto, remarkable from a typographic point of view, and which appeared to have been often used."
"那本地图册也绘制得非常精细，收集了世界各国的地图，还有几幅根据墨卡托投影法绘制的平面球形图，地图上的名称都是用法语标注的，但是上面也没有出版日期以及出版商的名字。","The atlas was a magnificent work, comprising maps of every country in the world, and several planispheres arranged upon Mercator’s projection, and of which the nomenclature was in French—but which also bore neither date nor name of publisher."
"因而，在这些他们可以寻找蛛丝马迹的不同物品中，无法查到什么。所以，也没有什么东西可以说明这艘船只是哪个国家的，而这艘船最近一定是到过这片海岸。","There was nothing, therefore, on these different articles by which they could be traced, and nothing consequently of a nature to show the nationality of the vessel which must have recently passed these shores."
"但是，无论这只箱子来自哪里，对于林肯岛上的居民们来说，都是一笔财富。那时候，他们已经利用自然物产为自己创造出了所需要的一切，而且多亏了他们的聪明才智，他们顺利完成了所有的工作。这看起来难道不像是上天的奖赏吗？为他们送来了这些人类工业产品。他们一致感谢上天。","But, wherever the chest might have come from, it was a treasure to the settlers on Lincoln Island.Till then, by making use of the productions of nature, they had created everything for themselves, and, thanks to their intelligence, they had managed without difficulty.But did it not appear as if Providence had wished to reward them by sending them these productions of human industry?Their thanks rose unanimously to Heaven."
"但是，他们中还有一个人不是很满足，那就是潘克洛夫。看来，箱子里面没有潘克洛夫明显认为重要的东西，因为他们翻到箱底的时候，潘克洛夫的欢呼声也渐渐没了热情。而且，他们清点完所有的东西时，听见潘克洛夫咕哝道：“这很好，但是你们看，箱子里没有我要的东西！”","However, one of them was not quite satisfied: it was Pencroft.It appeared that the chest did not contain something which he evidently held in great esteem, for in proportion as they approached the bottom of the box, his hurrahs diminished in heartiness, and, the inventory finished, he was heard to mutter these words:—“That’s all very fine, but you can see that there is nothing for me in that box!”"
"纳布听到了问道：","This led Neb to say,—"
"“怎么了，潘克洛夫，你还想要什么？”","“Why, friend Pencroft, what more do you expect?”"
"“半磅烟草，”潘克洛夫认真地回答道，“没有东西能比它使我心满意足了！”","“Half a pound of tobacco,” replied Pencroft seriously, “and nothing would have been wanting to complete my happiness!”"
"大家听后都禁不住笑了起来。","No one could help laughing at this speech of the sailor’s."
"但是，这只箱子的出现也说明，现在该对这个小岛进行一次彻查了，这比以往任何时候都显得必要。因而，他们商量好第二天早上破晓时分出发，沿着慈悲河溯流而上，为了到达西海岸。他们担心，如果真的有落难者登陆，他们可能会缺少物资，因而非常有必要及时过去提供帮助。","But the result of this discovery of the chest was, that it was now more than ever necessary to explore the island thoroughly.It was therefore agreed that the next morning at break of day, they should set out, by ascending the Mercy so as to reach the western shore.If any castaways had landed on the coast, it was to be feared they were without resources, and it was therefore the more necessary to carry help to them without delay."
"天黑之前，他们已经把不同物品搬回了花岗石宫，并整整齐齐地摆放在大厅里。那天是10月29日，正好是一个星期天。临睡前，郝伯特问工程师能否给他们念一段福音书。","During the day the different articles were carried to Granite House, where they were methodically arranged in the great hall.This day—the 29th of October—happened to be a Sunday, and, before going to bed, Herbert asked the engineer if he would not read them something from the Gospel."
"“很乐意啊！”赛勒斯·哈丁回答道。","“Willingly,” replied Cyrus Harding."
"他拿起这本神圣的书，正要打开，潘克洛夫阻止了他，说道：“上尉，我有点迷信。随便翻开哪一页，念出来你看到的第一节文字。我们看看是不是跟我们的处境吻合。”","He took the sacred volume, and was about to open it, when Pencroft stopped him, saying,—“Captain, I am superstitious.Open at random and read the first verse which, your eye falls upon.We will see if it applies to our situation.”"
"赛勒斯·哈丁听了水手的建议，不禁微笑起来，但还是依着水手的意思，他打开了正好是夹有书签的那一页。","Cyrus Harding smiled at the sailor’s idea, and, yielding to his wish, he opened exactly at a place where the leaves were separated by a marker."
"他立刻就注意到一个铅笔画的十字，它的位置是马太福音第七章第八节。他就念了出来，句子是这样的：","Immediately his eyes were attracted by a cross which, made with a pencil, was placed against the eighth verse of the seventh chapter of the Gospel of St. Matthew.He read the verse, which was this:—"
"“请求者都能如愿以偿，寻找者都能有所收获。”","“For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth.”"
"第三章","Chapter 3"
"第二天，是10月30日，大家都准备好已筹划的探险活动了，最近发生的一些事情使得这次探险极为必要。事实上，事情发展到现在，林肯岛上的居民已经不再需要帮助了，他们甚至有能力去帮助别人了。","The next day, the 30th of October, all was ready for the proposed exploring expedition, which recent events had rendered so necessary.In fact, things had so come about that the settlers in Lincoln Island no longer needed help for themselves, but were even able to carry it to others."
"因而，他们商定沿着慈悲河溯流而上，能划多远就划多远。这样探险者们就能轻松地走完一大段路程，并且可以把他们的食品和武器运送到小岛西部的高地上。","It was therefore agreed that they should ascend the Mercy as far as the river was navigable.A great part of the distance would thus be traversed without fatigue, and the explorers could transport their provisions and arms to an advanced point in the west of the island."
"他们不仅需要考虑应当带过去的东西，而且还需要考虑有可能要带回花岗石宫的东西。如果真如他们预料的那样，海岸曾有过失事的船只，那么，船上遗留下来的许多东西就会成为他们合法的战利品。在这种情况下，手推车就比轻舟有用多了，但是手推车十分笨重，不方便拖过去，因而也就更难使用了。潘克洛夫感到很遗憾，箱子里除了没有“他的半磅烟草”，另外还缺少两匹新泽西马，那对拓荒地来说用处多大啊！","It was necessary to think not only of the things which they should take with them, but also of those which they might have by chance to bring back to Granite House.If there had been a wreck on the coast, as was supposed, there would be many things cast up, which would be lawfully their prizes.In the event of this, the cart would have been of more use than the light canoe, but it was heavy and clumsy to drag, and therefore more difficult to use; this led Pencroft to express his regret that the chest had not contained, besides “his halfpound of tobacco,” a pair of strong New Jersey horses, which would have been very useful to the colony!"
"纳布已经包好了食物，有大块的肉，还有几加仑啤酒，也就是说，这足够他们吃三天了，而这正是哈丁预计探险活动所需要的时间。此外，他们还希望路上能够再猎获一些食物，纳布还特意带上了便携式火炉。","The provisions, which Neb had already packed up, consisted of a store of meat and of several gallons of beer, that is to say enough to sustain them for three days, the time which Harding assigned for the expedition.They hoped besides to supply themselves on the road, and Neb took care not to forget the portable stove."
"居民们携带的工具只有两把砍柴斧，可以用它们在茂密的丛林里砍出一条道来，他们带的仪器有望远镜和袖珍罗盘。","The only tools the settlers took were the two woodmen’s axes, which they could use to cut a path through the thick forests, as also the instruments, the telescope and pocket-compass."
"至于武器，他们选了两只燧发枪，这可能要比撞针枪对他们更有用。因为燧发枪只需要打火石，这很容易找到；而撞针枪则需要用雷管，如果经常使用，他们有限的几根雷管很快就会用完的。此外，他们还带了一支卡宾枪和一些子弹。至于火药，桶里大约有50磅，他们需要带上一小部分，但是工程师希望可以自己制造出一种炸药，这样他们就能节省一些火药了。除了火器外，他们还带了五把配有精致皮鞘的弯刀，现在一切都准备好了，居民们就可以抱着几分胜算在广袤的森林里进行探险了。","For weapons they selected the two flint-lock guns, which were likely to be more useful to them than the percussion fowling-pieces, the first only requiring flints which could be easily replaced, and the latter needing fulminating caps, a frequent use of which would soon exhaust their limited stock.However, they took also one of the carbines and some cartridges.As to the powder, of which there was about fifty pounds in the barrel, a small supply of it had to be taken, but the engineer hoped to manufacture an explosive substance which would allow them to husband it.To the firearms were added the five cutlasses well sheathed in leather, and, thus supplied, the settlers could venture into the vast forest with some chance of success."
"潘克洛夫、赫伯特和纳布自不用说，他们有了这样的装备，高兴至极，虽然他们已经向赛勒斯·哈丁承诺过，除非万不得已，否则不会开枪。","It is useless to add that Pencroft, Herbert, and Neb, thus armed, were at the summit of their happiness, although Cyrus Harding made them promise not to fire a shot unless it was necessary."
"早上六点的时候，小舟就从海岸启航了，所有人都上了船，包括托普，他们向慈悲河口划去。","At six in the morning the canoe put off from the shore; all had embarked, including Top, and they proceeded to the mouth of the Mercy."
"半个小时之前，海水就已经开始上涨了。因此，再过几个小时，就会出现水流，小舟正好可以顺势而上，而等到退潮的时候，小舟溯流而上就有些困难了。潮水已经变得迅猛，而再过三天就是月圆之日，这足以使小船漂浮在水流的中心。小船就在高高的河岸之间快速前进，并且不需要划桨来加快速度。几分钟后，探险者们来到慈悲河形成的的一个拐角处，七个月前，潘克洛夫曾在这里建造了他的第一只木筏。","The tide had begun to come up half an hour before.For several hours, therefore, there would be a current, which it was well to profit by, for later the ebb would make it difficult to ascend the river.The tide was already strong, for in three days the moon would be full, and it was enough to keep the boat in the center of the current, where it floated swiftly along between the high banks without its being necessary to increase its speed by the aid of the oars.In a few minutes the explorers arrived at the angle formed by the Mercy and exactly at the place where, seven months before, Pencroft had made his first raft of wood."
"转过这个突出的拐角之后，河面变宽了，岸边有高大的常绿枞树，河水在它们的树荫下流动。","After this sudden angle the river widened and flowed under the shade of great evergreen firs."
"岸边的景色秀丽壮观。赛勒斯·哈丁和伙伴们不由得赞叹大自然用流水和树木轻易营造出的这一派可爱的景象。随着他们不断往前划行，森林渐渐消失在身后了。河的右岸生长着一些秀丽的榆树科树木，这些珍贵的榆树对于建筑师是很有用的，在流水的冲刷下，它们也岿然不动。河岸上还有许多植物，属于同一科目，其中有一种很特别，它的果实可以用来制作一种非常有用的油。往前再划行了一阵后，赫伯特注意到一种木通科植物，那是一种缠绕灌木，在水里浸泡之后可以制成结实的缆绳，此外还有两三棵美丽的黑檀树，上面各种花纹缠绕。","The aspect of the banks was magnificent.Cyrus Harding and his companions could not but admire the lovely effects so easily produced by nature with water and trees.As they advanced the forest element diminished.On the right bank of the river grew magnificent specimens of the ulmaceae tribe, the precious elm, so valuable to builders, and which withstands well the action of water.Then there were numerous groups belonging to the same family, among others one in particular, the fruit of which produces a very useful oil.Further on, Herbert remarked the lardizabala, a twining shrub which, when bruised in water, furnishes excellent cordage; and two or three ebony trees of a beautiful black, crossed with capricious veins."
"小舟时不时地会在方便靠岸的地方停下，然后吉丁·史佩莱、赫伯特和潘克洛夫拿上枪，跟着托普跳上岸去。他们并没有想捕获猎物，而是发现了一些有用的植物。少年博物学家发现了一种野生的藜科菠菜，还有许多属于卷心菜一类的十字花科植物，植物完全可以移植培养，他感到非常开心。此外，还有水芹、辣根、萝卜，以及一些不足三英尺高的草茎植物，毛茸茸的茎上结着褐色的种籽。","From time to time, in certain places where the landing was easy, the canoe was stopped, when Gideon Spilett, Herbert, and Pencroft, their guns in their hands, and preceded by Top, jumped on shore.Without expecting game, some useful plant might be met with, and the young naturalist was delighted with discovering a sort of wild spinach, belonging to the order of chenopodiaceae, and numerous specimens of cruciferae, belonging to the cabbage tribe, which it would certainly be possible to cultivate by transplanting.There were cresses, horseradish, turnips, and lastly, little branching hairy stalks, scarcely more than three feet high, which produced brownish grains."
"“你这道这是什么吗？”赫伯特问水手。","Do you know what this plant is?” asked Herbert of the sailor."
"“烟草！”潘克洛夫喊道，他最喜欢的这种植物，他显然是从未见过在他烟斗之外的。","“Tobacco!” cried Pencroft, who evidently had never seen his favorite plant except in the bowl of his pipe."
"“不是，潘克洛夫，”赫伯特回答道，“这不是烟草，是芥菜。”","“No, Pencroft,” replied Herbert; “this is not tobacco, it is mustard.”"
"“去它的什么芥菜！”水手回答道，“但是如果你碰巧发现了烟草，孩子，一定不能错过！”","“Mustard be hanged!” returned the sailor; “but if by chance you happen to come across a tobacco-plant, my boy, pray don’t scorn that!”"
"“我们总有一天会找到的！”吉丁·史佩莱说道。","“We shall find it some day!” said Gideon Spilett."
"“好啊！”潘克洛夫喊道，“如果真有那么一天，我真不知道我们小岛上还缺什么了！”","“Well!” exclaimed Pencroft, “when that day comes, I do not know what more will be wanting in our island!”"
"他们小心翼翼地把各种不同的植物连根拔起，带到小舟上，赛勒斯·哈丁仍然在沉思。","These different plants, which had been carefully rooted up, were carried to the canoe, where Cyrus Harding had remained buried in thought."
"记者、赫伯特和潘克洛夫就这样不停地下船上岸，有时是慈悲河的右岸，有时是左岸。","The reporter, Herbert, and Pencroft in this manner frequently disembarked, sometimes on the right bank, sometimes on the left bank of the Mercy."
"慈悲河的左岸相对没那么陡峭，但右岸的树木更加茂密。工程师看过袖珍罗盘之后，确信河流在第一个拐角处之后明显是西南－东北走向，而且有三英里长的距离几乎都是笔直的。然而在这个拐角之后，方向似乎是改变了，慈悲河继续向西北方向延伸过去，直到富兰克林山的支脉，那是河流的源头。","The latter was less abrupt, but the former more wooded.The engineer ascertained by consulting his pocket-compass that the direction of the river from the first turn was obviously southwest and northeast, and nearly straight for a length of about three miles.But it was to be supposed that this direction changed beyond that point, and that the Mercy continued to the north-west, towards the spurs of Mount Franklin, among which the river rose."
"有一次在岸上活动的时，吉丁·史佩莱设法活捉了四只鹑鸡。这种鸟有着长而薄的喙，细长的脖颈，短短的翅膀，而且没有尾巴。赫伯特把他们称之为鹌鹑，这很准确。他们决定把这些鹌鹑带回去，使它们成为未来家禽场上的第一批居住者。","During one of these excursions, Gideon Spilett managed to get hold of two couples of living gallinaceae.They were birds with long, thin beaks, lengthened necks, short wings, and without any appearance of a tail.Herbert rightly gave them the name of tinamous, and it was resolved that they should be the first tenants of their future poultry-yard."
"但是直到那时，他们还没有开过枪。第一声回荡在远西森林里的枪声，是由一只美丽的小鸟引起的，它像是翠鸟。","But till then the guns had not spoken, and the first report which awoke the echoes of the forest of the Far West was provoked by the appearance of a beautiful bird, resembling the kingfisher."
"“我认识这只鸟！”潘克洛夫喊道，他的枪似乎走火了。","“I recognize him!” cried Pencroft, and it seemed as if his gun went off by itself."
"“你认识什么？”记者问道。","“What do you recognize?” asked the reporter."
"“我们第一次打猎的时候，这只鸟逃掉了，而且我们是用它的名字为那部分森林命名的。”","“The bird which escaped us on our first excursion, and from which we gave the name to that part of the forest.”"
"“啄木鸟！”赫伯特喊道。","“A jacamar!” cried Herbert."
"它确实是一只啄木鸟，羽毛闪着金属的光泽。一声枪响，小鸟掉落在地上，托普把它衔起来带回到小舟上。同时，还有六只猩猩鹦鹉也被打落到地上了。这些猩猩鹦鹉大小跟鸽子差不多，羽毛中掺杂着绿色，部分翅膀是深红色的，冠毛有道白边。这枪是少年打的，他感到很自豪。相对于啄木鸟，鹦鹉更适合作为食物，因为啄木鸟肉质比较糙。但是，要劝潘克洛夫相信，他打到的不是最好吃的鸟，是困难的一件事。上午十点的时候，小舟划到慈悲河的第二个拐角处，离河口处约有五英里。他们就在这停了下来，在大树的荫凉下吃早餐。此处河流的宽度仍有60到70英尺，河床有五到六英尺深。工程师观察了一下，注意到这里有许多支流，但是却不能通航，因为它们都不过是些小溪流。至于森林，包括啄木鸟林和远西森林，都是一望无际。无论是在森林深处还是慈悲河岸的树下，都没有出现人的踪迹。探险者们还没有发现一处可疑的踪迹。很明显，这些树木并没有被砍柴斧动过，而在缠绕的灌木丛的树干上和长草中间盘绕的树藤，也没有被开荒者的刀劈开。如果落难者已经在小岛上登陆了，他们不可能已经离开海岸，而在树林里又找不到假定的失事船只中的生还者。","It was indeed a jacamar, of which the plumage shines with a metallic luster.A shot brought it to the ground, and Top carried it to the canoe.At the same time half a dozen lories were brought down.The lory is of the size of a pigeon, the plumage dashed with green, part of the wings crimson, and its crest bordered with white.To the young boy belonged the honor of this shot, and he was proud enough of it.Lories are better food than the jacamar, the flesh of which is rather tough, but it was difficult to persuade Pencroft that he had not killed the king of eatable birds.It was ten o’clock in the morning when the canoe reached a second angle of the Mercy, nearly five miles from its mouth.Here a halt was made for breakfast under the shade of some splendid trees.The river still measured from sixty to seventy feet in breadth, and its bed from five to six feet in depth.The engineer had observed that it was increased by numerous affluents, but they were unnavigable, being simply little streams.As to the forest, including Jacamar Wood, as well as the forests of the Far West, it extended as far as the eye could reach.In no place, either in the depths of the forests or under the trees on the banks of the Mercy, was the presence of man revealed.The explorers could not discover one suspicious trace.It was evident that the woodman’s axe had never touched these trees, that the pioneer’s knife had never severed the creepers hanging from one trunk to another in the midst of tangled brushwood and long grass.If castaways had landed on the island, they could not have yet quitted the shore, and it was not in the woods that the survivors of the supposed shipwreck should be sought."
"因而，工程师迫切地想要到林肯岛的西海岸去，据他估计，至少还有五英里远。","The engineer therefore manifested some impatience to reach the western coast of Lincoln Island, which was at least five miles distant according to his estimation."
"他们继续航行，慈悲河似乎不是朝着海岸流动，而是向富兰克林山流去，他们决定，只要船底有足够的水让它漂浮，就会一直乘船前行的。因为这样既可以节省体力也可以节省时间，否则，他们就不得不用斧子在密密的丛林间开辟出一条道路来。但是不久，潮水就完全不起作用了。不知是因为潮水在下降——现在已经到了退潮的时间了，还是离慈悲河口的这段距离，感觉不到潮水的作用了。因而，他们不得不划桨前行。郝伯特和纳布各拿过一支桨，潘克洛夫则在一旁摇橹。很快，森林变得越来越稀疏，树木之间的距离也越来越远，通常树是孤零零地立着。但是树木之间的距离越远，它们看起来也越好，这要得益于周围自由流通的纯净空气。","The voyage was continued, and as the Mercy appeared to flow not towards the shore, but rather towards Mount Franklin, it was decided that they should use the boat as long as there was enough water under its keel to float it.It was both fatigue spared and time gained, for they would have been obliged to cut a path through the thick wood with their axes.But soon the flow completely failed them, either the tide was going down, and it was about the hour, or it could no longer be felt at this distance from the mouth of the Mercy.They had therefore to make use of the oars.Herbert and Neb each took one, and Pencroft took the scull.The forest soon became less dense, the trees grew further apart and often quite isolated.But the further they were from each other the more magnificent they appeared, profiting, as they did, by the free, pure air which circulated around them."
"这一地带的植物是多么秀丽啊！当然，植物学家可以根据这一地带生长的植被，毫不迟疑地指出林肯岛所在的纬度。","What splendid specimens of the flora of this latitude!Certainly their presence would have been enough for a botanist to name without hesitation the parallel which traversed Lincoln Island."
"“桉树！”赫伯特喊道。","“Eucalypti!” cried Herbert."
"是的，那些美丽的树木确实是桉树。这种生长在较高纬度地带的大树与澳大利亚和新西兰的桉树，和林肯岛处于同一纬度。一些桉树高达200英尺。底部的树干周长约有20英尺，树皮凹凸不平，里面含有芳香的红色树胶。没有植物能比这些高大的桃金娘科树更奇妙、更珍稀了，叶片不是水平生长的，而是垂直生长的，因而向上面展开的是树的叶边，而不是叶面，这样更多的阳光就可以透过叶子照射下来。","They were, in fact, those splendid trees, the giants of the extratropical zone, the congeners of the Australian and New Zealand eucalyptus, both situated under the same latitude as Lincoln Island.Some rose to a height of two hundred feet.Their trunks at the base measured twenty feet in circumference, and their bark was covered by a network of farrows containing a red, sweet-smelling gum.Nothing is more wonderful or more singular than those enormous specimens of the order of the myrtaceae, with their leaves placed vertically and not horizontally, so that an edge and not a surface looks upwards, the effect being that the sun’s rays penetrate more freely among the trees."
"桉树下面绿草如茵，有一群小鸟从灌木丛中飞出来，在阳光下闪闪发光，像是扑棱着翅膀的红宝石。","The ground at the foot of the eucalypti was carpeted with grass, and from the bushes escaped flights of little birds, which glittered in the sunlight like winged rubies."
"“这些像是乔木！”纳布喊道，“可是这些树有什么用处吗？”","“These are something like trees!” cried Neb; “but are they good for anything?”"
"“哼！”潘克洛夫回答道，“当然这些树也算是植物中的庞然大物了，就像是人类中的巨人一样，它们没有什么用处，除了在展览会上显摆！”","“Pooh!” replied Pencroft.“Of course there are vegetable giants as well as human giants, and they are no good, except to show themselves at fairs!”"
"“我想你错了，潘克洛夫，”吉丁·史佩莱回答道，“桉木现在开始非常适合用来制作箱柜。”","“I think that you are mistaken, Pencroft,” replied Gideon Spilett, “and that the wood of the eucalyptus has begun to be very advantageously employed in cabinet-making.”"
"“我可以再补充一点，”赫伯特说道，“桉树所属的这一科目包括很多有用的种类：有番石榴树，它的果子可以用来做番石榴酱；丁香树，可以制作香料；石榴树，可以结石榴；桃金娘丁香树的果子可以用来酿制美酒；乌葛杨梅树含有极好的酒精成分；丁香杨梅树的树皮可以做成极好的肉桂；尤琴椒树可以用来制作牙买加辣椒；而普通的杨梅树的嫩芽和果实可以提取香料；桉树产生一种甜美的木蜜；几内亚桉树的树液发酵之后则可以酿制啤酒。总之，澳大利亚所有的橡胶树和铁皮树都属于桃金娘科，它包括46类、1300多种。","“And I may add,” said Herbert, “that the eucalyptus belongs to a family which comprises many useful members; the guava-tree, from whose fruit guava jelly is made; the clove-tree, which produces the spice; the pomegranate-tree, which bears pomegranates; the Eugeacia Cauliflora, the fruit of which is used in making a tolerable wine; the Ugui myrtle, which contains an excellent alcoholic liquor; the Caryophyllus myrtle, of which the bark forms an esteemed cinnamon; the Eugenia Pimenta, from whence comes Jamaica pepper; the common myrtle, from whose buds and berries spice is sometimes made; the Eucalyptus manifera, which yields a sweet sort of manna; the Guinea Eucalyptus, the sap of which is transformed into beer by fermentation; in short, all those trees known under the name of gum-trees or iron-bark trees in Australia, belong to this family of the myrtaceae, which contains forty-six genera and thirteen hundred species!”"
"大家听着少年滔滔不绝地讲着，他兴致勃勃地进行着小植物学讲座。赛勒斯·哈丁微笑着听着，而潘克洛夫心里也升起一种难以名状的自豪感。","The lad was allowed to run on, and he delivered his little botanical lecture with great animation.Cyrus Harding listened smiling, and Pencroft with an indescribable feeling of pride."
"“很好，赫伯特，”潘克洛夫回答道，“但是我发誓，这些大树中没有一棵是你刚才所提到过的！”","“Very good, Herbert,” replied Pencroft, “but I could swear that all those useful specimens you have just told us about are none of them giants like these!”"
"“那倒是，潘克洛夫。”","“That is true, Pencroft.”"
"“那就跟我说的一样了，”水手回答道，“也就是说，这些大树没什么用处！”","“That supports what I said,” returned the sailor, “namely, that these giants are good for nothing!”"
"“你错了，潘克洛夫，”工程师说道，“给我们遮阴的这些大桉树是有些用的。”","“There you are wrong, Pencroft,” said the engineer; “these gigantic eucalypti, which shelter us, are good for something.”"
"“什么用处？”","“And what is that?”"
"“它可以保护周围居民的健康。你知道在澳大利亚和新西兰，他们是怎么称呼这种树的吗？“","“To render the countries which they inhabit healthy.Do you know what they are called in Australia and New Zealand?”"
"“不知道，上尉。”","“No, captain.”"
"“它们被称为热病树。”","“They are called ‘fever trees.’”"
"“是因为这些树会让人发烧吗？”","“Because they give fevers?”"
"“不，因为他们可以让人避免发烧！”","“No, because they prevent them!”"
"“很好。我必须把这点记下来。”记者说道。","“Good.I must note that,” said the reporter."
"“那就记下来吧，亲爱的史佩莱，好像还有研究证明，桉树足以驱除瘴气。这一说法已经在中欧和北非地区的一些国家得到验证，那些地方的土壤绝对对人体有害，然而种植桉树之后，当地居民的卫生条件都已经渐渐得到了改善。有桃金娘科植物覆盖的地区，就没有断断续续的热病肆虐。这已经是不争的事实了，林肯岛对于我们这些居民来说，还真是个不错的地方。”","“Note it then, my dear Spilett; for it appears proved that the presence of the eucalyptus is enough to neutralize miasmas.This natural antidote has been tried in certain countries in the middle of Europe and the north of Africa where the soil was absolutely unhealthy, and the sanitary condition of the inhabitants has been gradually ameliorated.No more intermittent fevers prevail in the regions now covered with forests of the myrtaceae.This fact is now beyond doubt, and it is a happy circumstance for us settlers in Lincoln Island.”"
"“啊，多好的小岛啊！受上帝保佑的小岛！”潘克洛夫喊道，“我跟你们说，这里什么都不缺，除了——”","“Ah! what an island!What a blessed island!” cried Pencroft.“I tell you, it wants nothing—unless it is—”"
"“会有的，潘克洛夫，我们会找到的，”工程师回答说，“但是现在我们必须继续航行了，小船能在河里走多远，我们就划多远！”","“That will come, Pencroft, that will be found,” replied the engineer; “but now we must continue our voyage and push on as far as the river will carry our boat!”"
"因而，他们又向前划行了两英里，现在处在长满桉树的小岛中部，小岛这部分的树林里主要植物就是桉树。慈悲河两岸长满桉树，望不到边，河水就在高高的绿色河岸之间曲曲折折地流动。河床经常被长长的水草堵住，有时甚至是尖尖的石头，这也使得水中的航行变得非常困难。船桨现在已经划不动了，潘克洛夫不得不使用长杆撑船。同时他们也发现水位变得越来越浅，小船很快就不能划行了。太阳已经在地平线下沉了，树木在地上投下长长的影子。赛勒斯·哈丁明白，他不可能一路乘船到达小岛的西海岸，于是决定在水浅到不能继续前行的地方停下来宿营。据他估计，这里离海滨还有五六英里远，而在这片未知的丛林中长夜跋涉，距离太远了。","The exploration was therefore continued for another two miles in the midst of country covered with eucalypti, which predominated in the woods of this portion of the island.The space which they occupied extended as far as the eye could reach on each side of the Mercy, which wound along between high green banks.The bed was often obstructed by long weeds, and even by pointed rocks, which rendered the navigation very difficult.The action of the oars was prevented, and Pencroft was obliged to push with a pole.They found also that the water was becoming shallower and shallower, and that the canoe must soon stop.The sun was already sinking towards the horizon, and the trees threw long shadows on the ground.Cyrus Harding, seeing that he could not hope to reach the western coast of the island in one journey, resolved to camp at the place where any further navigation was prevented by want of water.He calculated that they were still five or six miles from the coast, and this distance was too great for them to attempt during the night in the midst of unknown woods."
"小船穿过森林继续前行，这时，森林变得越来越茂密，而且里面似乎居住着更多的生物。因为如果水手没有看错，他想是看到了成群的猴子在树林间跳跃。有时甚至会有两三只猴子跑到离小舟很近的地方停下，盯着这群居民，丝毫没有表现出害怕，它们仿佛是头一次看到人类，还不懂得害怕他们。要是开枪打下这样一只猴子，应当是轻而易举的，而且潘克洛夫也很想开枪试一下，但是哈丁却不同意进行这样一次毫无用处的屠杀。他们应当谨慎一些，因为这些猴子，或者说是猿猴，看上去十分强壮而且极其敏捷，对它们进行不必要的侵犯毫无意义，而且这些动物很可能不会顾忌探险者们火器的威力，而对他们发起袭击。确实，水手是单纯从食物的角度来考虑这些猴子的，因为这些食草动物味道鲜美。但是既然他们已经储备了充足的食物，就没有必要去浪费他们的弹药了。","The boat was pushed on through the forest, which gradually became thicker again, and appeared also to have more inhabitants; for if the eyes of the sailor did not deceive him, he thought he saw bands of monkeys springing among the trees.Sometimes even two or three of these animals stopped at a little distance from the canoe and gazed at the settlers without manifesting any terror, as if, seeing men for the first time, they had not yet learned to fear them.It would have been easy to bring down one of these quadramani with a gunshot, and Pencroft was greatly tempted to fire, but Harding opposed so useless a massacre.This was prudent, for the monkeys, or apes rather, appearing to be very powerful and extremely active, it was useless to provoke an unnecessary aggression, and the creatures might, ignorant of the power of the explorers’ firearms, have attacked them.It is true that the sailor considered the monkeys from a purely alimentary point of view, for those animals which are herbivorous make very excellent game; but since they had an abundant supply of provisions, it was a pity to waste their ammunition."
"将近四点的时候，他们已经很难在慈悲河上划船前行了，因为一些水生植物和岩石阻塞了他们的道路。河岸越来越高，而且他们已经离富兰克林山的支脉很近了。河水的源头应该就在不远处，因为慈悲河就是由南面山坡的水源补给的。","Towards four o’clock, the navigation of the Mercy became exceedingly difficult, for its course was obstructed by aquatic plants and rocks.The banks rose higher and higher, and already they were approaching the spurs of Mount Franklin.The source could not be far off, since it was fed by the water from the southern slopes of the mountain."
"“再过一刻钟，”水手说道，“我们就不得不停下来了，上尉。”","“In a quarter of an hour,” said the sailor, “we shall be obliged to stop, captain.”"
"“好的，我们一会儿就停下，潘克洛夫，我们将找个地方宿营。”","“Very well, we will stop, Pencroft, and we will make our encampment for the night.”"
"“我们离花岗石宫有多远了？”赫伯特问道。","“At what distance are we from Granite House?” asked Herbert."
"“大约有七英里吧，”工程师回答道，“把河流的弯道也计算在内，这条小河已经把我们带到西北方向了。”","“About seven miles,” replied the engineer, “taking into calculation, however, the detours of the river, which has carried us to the northwest.”"
"“我们还要继续往前走吗？”记者问道。","“Shall we go on?” asked the reporter."
"“是啊，只要我们可以。”赛勒斯·哈丁回答道，“明天天一亮，我们就离开小船，我希望能在两小时内走到海滨那边，那样我们就有一整天在海岸探索了。”","“Yes, as long as we can,” replied Cyrus Harding.“To-morrow, at break of day, we will leave the canoe, and in two hours I hope we shall cross the distance which separates us from the coast, and then we shall have the whole day in which to explore the shore.”"
"“好啊！”潘克洛夫回答道。","“Go ahead!” replied Pencroft."
"但是很快船就擦到了布满石子的河底，现在河面已经不足20英尺宽了。两岸的树像是在头顶凉亭一样，光线有些阴暗。他们也听到了瀑布的声响，这就说明河流上游几百英尺处有一道天然屏障。","But soon the boat grated on the stony bottom of the river, which was now not more than twenty feet in breadth.The trees met like a bower overhead, and caused a half-darkness.They also heard the noise of a waterfall, which showed that a few hundred feet up the river there was a natural barrier."
"过了一会儿，他们拐过河的一个急弯，透过树木看到一个小瀑布。小舟再次碰到了河底，几分钟后，小舟在右岸的一棵树干下停泊了。","Presently, after a sudden turn of the river, a cascade appeared through the trees.The canoe again touched the bottom, and in a few minutes it was moored to a trunk near the right bank."
"那时已经将近五点钟了。落日的余晖穿过厚厚的叶片，闪烁着微光，投射在小瀑布上，使得喷射的水雾闪耀着彩虹的光芒。慈悲河就消失在前面的灌木丛里了，河的源头就隐藏在那里。多条溪流汇入河水，使它渐渐在下游成为一条普通的河流，而这里的慈悲河只是一条浅浅的、清澈的小溪。","It was nearly five o’clock.The last rays of the sun gleamed through the thick foliage and glanced on the little waterfall, making the spray sparkle with all the colors of the rainbow.Beyond that, the Mercy was lost in the bushwood, where it was fed from some hidden source.The different streams which flowed into it increased it to a regular river further down, but here it was simply a shallow, limpid brook."
"这里景色很美，于是大家商定在这里宿营。拓荒者们下了船，很快就在树丛下点燃了一堆篝火，如果必要，赛勒斯·哈丁和伙伴们还可以在树枝上过夜。","It was agreed to camp here, as the place was charming.The colonists disembarked, and a fire was soon lighted under a clump of trees, among the branches of which Cyrus Harding and his companions could, if it was necessary, take refuge for the night."
"他们已经饥肠辘辘了，狼吞虎咽地吃完了晚餐，剩下来要考虑的就是睡觉的问题了。但在晚上，他们听到了一阵可疑的咆哮声，于是决定在夜里燃着大火，劈啪作响的篝火可以保护他们安睡。纳布和潘克洛夫轮流看守火堆，不停地添加燃料。他们觉得看到了丛林中有些野兽的黑影在营地周围爬动，但这一夜平安地过去了，第二天是10月31日，早上五点钟的时候，他们就整装待发了。","Supper was quickly devoured, for they were very hungry, and then there was only sleeping to think of.But, as roarings of rather a suspicious nature had been heard during the evening, a good fire was made up for the night, so as to protect the sleepers with its crackling flames.Neb and Pencroft also watched by turns, and did not spare fuel.They thought they saw the dark forms of some wild animals prowling round the camp among the bushes, but the night passed without incident, and the next day, the 31st of October, at five o’clock in the morning, all were on foot, ready for a start."
"第四章","Chapter 4"
"早上六点的时候，居民们匆匆吃过早饭，选择了一条距离最近的路，向小岛西海岸进发。要多长时间才能到达那里呢？赛勒斯·哈丁说过需要两个小时，但是这当然还要取决于他们可能遇到的实际障碍。因为途中可能需要在草丛、灌木丛以及藤蔓中开辟道路，于是他们手持斧子，携带枪支。由于昨天夜里听到野兽的咆哮声，他们采取了明智的方法，增强戒备。","It was six o’ clock in the morning when the settlers, after a hasty breakfast, set out to reach by the shortest way, the western coast of the island.And how long would it take to do this?Cyrus Harding had said two hours, but of course that depended on the nature of the obstacles they might meet with As it was probable that they would have to cut a path through the grass, shrubs, and creepers, they marched axe in hand, and with guns also ready, wisely taking warning from the cries of the wild beasts heard in the night."
"露营的确切地点可以由富兰克林山的方位决定，由于北面不到三英里处矗立着火山，他们只得朝西南方向直走，然后到达西海岸。他们仔细地把小舟藏好，然后就出发了。潘克洛夫和纳布带了足够大家两天吃的食物。因而，他们就不需要去打猎了。工程师建议同伴们尽量不要开火，这样就不容易向海边附近的人暴露他们的行踪了。在瀑布上不远处，乳香黄连木中有灌木丛，他们第一次用斧子开辟道路，赛勒斯·哈丁则手拿罗盘，在前面带路。","The exact position of the encampment could be determined by the bearing of Mount Franklin, and as the volcano arose in the north at a distance of less than three miles, they had only to go straight towards the southwest to reach the western coast.They set out, having first carefully secured the canoe.Pencroft and Neb carried sufficient provision for the little band for at least two days.It would not thus be necessary to hunt.The engineer advised his companions to refrain from firing, that their presence might not be betrayed to any one near the shore.The first hatchet blows were given among the brushwood in the midst of some mastic-trees, a little above the cascade; and his compass in his hand, Cyrus Harding led the way."
"森林里大部分树木的种类都是他们在湖边和眺望岗上见过的。有喜马拉雅雪杉、绿枞、木麻黄树、橡胶树、桉树、木槿、雪松和其他树，大都是中等高度，因为数量过多，影响了它们的生长。","The forest here was composed for the most part of trees which had already been met with near the lake and on Prospect Heights.There were deodars, Douglas firs, casuarinas, gum trees, eucalypti, hibiscus, cedars, and other trees, generally of a moderate size, for their number prevented their growth."
"从出发到现在，居民们已经从构成小岛山脉系统的斜坡走下来了，到了一处干燥的土地上，但是这里植物茂盛，说明有隐蔽的地下沼泽或是溪流润泽。但是，赛勒斯·哈丁记得去往火山口的途中，除了红河和慈悲河外，并没见过其他水道。","Since their departure, the settlers had descended the slopes which constituted the mountain system of the island, on to a dry soil, but the luxuriant vegetation of which indicated it to be watered either by some subterranean marsh or by some stream.However, Cyrus Harding did not remember having seen, at the time of his excursion to the crater, any other watercourses but the Red Creek and the Mercy."
"在探险之行的第一段路程中，他们看到成群结队的猴子，这些猴子看到他们，露出极其惊讶的神态，因为它们此前从未见过人类。吉丁·史佩莱开玩笑道，这些敏捷欢快的四足动物不知是否把他和同伴们当做它们退化的同胞了。","During the first part of their excursion, they saw numerous troops of monkeys who exhibited great astonishment at the sight of men, whose appearance was so new to them.Gideon Spilett jokingly asked whether these active and merry quadrupeds did not consider him and his companions as degenerate brothers."
"当然，由于灌木丛、藤蔓以及树干的阻挡，他们步履维艰。而那些灵活的动物则在树枝间蹦跳穿梭，在它们的道路上畅通无阻，人类比这些身体柔软的动物是逊色多了。虽然有很多猴子，但幸运的是，它们对人类并无敌意。","And certainly, pedestrians, hindered at each step by bushes, caught by creepers, barred by trunks of trees, did not shine beside those supple animals, who, bounding from branch to branch, were hindered by nothing on their course.The monkeys were numerous, but happily they did not manifest any hostile disposition."
"他们还看到了一些猪、刺鼠、袋鼠以及其他噬齿类动物，还有两三只树考拉，潘克洛夫很想朝它们开枪。","Several pigs, agoutis, kangaroos, and other rodents were seen, also two or three koalas, at which Pencroft longed to have a shot."
"“等着，”他说，“你们现在可以蹦跳、玩耍，等我们回来的时候再收拾你们！”","“But,” said he, “you may jump and play just now; we shall have one or two words to say to you on our way back!”"
"九点半的时候，他们前面突然出现了一道未知的河流，约有30至40英尺宽，湍急的水流冲击着河中无数的岩石，溅起泡沫。河流很深，也很清澈，但是却完全不能通航。","At half-past nine the way was suddenly found to be barred by an unknown stream, from thirty to forty feet broad, whose rapid current dashed foaming over the numerous rocks which interrupted its course.This creek was deep and clear, but it was absolutely unnavigable."
"“我们被阻断了！”纳布喊道。","“We are cut off!” cried Neb."
"“不，”赫伯特回答道，“不过是条小河而已，我们可以毫不费力地游过去。”","“No,” replied Herbert, “it is only a stream, and we can easily swim over.”"
"“为什么要游过去呢？”哈丁反问道，“很明显，这条小河通向大海。我们就在这边沿着河岸走，如果它没有很快把我们带到能到海岸，那就奇怪了。前进！”","“What would be the use of that?” returned Harding.“This creek evidently runs to the sea.Let us remain on this side and follow the bank, and I shall be much astonished if it does not lead us very quickly to the coast.Forward!”"
"“等一下，”记者说道，“我们要怎么称呼这条小河呢，朋友们？不要让我们的地图有不完整的地方。”","“One minute,” said the reporter.“The name of this creek, my friends?Do not let us leave our geography incomplete.”"
"“对！”潘克洛夫道。","“All right!” said Pencroft."
"“孩子，你来给它命名吧。”工程师对少年说道。","“Name it, my boy,” said the engineer, addressing the lad."
"“我们等到了河口再给它命名，不是会更好吗？”赫伯特回答道。","“Will it not be better to wait until we have explored it to its mouth?” answered Herbert."
"“很好，”赛勒斯·哈丁回答道，“我们就沿着河岸走，越快越好，不要停。”","“Very well,” replied Cyrus Harding.“Let us follow it as fast as we can without stopping.”"
"“再等一下！”潘克洛夫说道。","“Still another minute!” said Pencroft."
"“什么事？”记者问道。","“What’s the matter?” asked the reporter."
"“虽然我们不能打猎，但是我想捕鱼总是可以的吧。”水手说道。","“Though hunting is forbidden, fishing is allowed, I suppose,” said the sailor."
"“我们没有时间了。”工程师回答道。","“We have no time to lose,” replied the engineer."
"“噢！就五分钟！”潘克洛夫回答道，“我只要五分钟时间，这也是为了我们的早饭啊！”","“Oh! five minutes!” replied Pencroft, “I only ask for five minutes to use in the interest of our breakfast!”"
"接着，潘克洛夫趴在岸边，将胳膊伸到水中，很快就从石间抓出几十只很好的小龙虾来。","And Pencroft, lying down on the bank, plunged his arm into the water, and soon pulled up several dozen of fine crayfish from among the stones."
"“太好了！”纳布喊道，并过去帮忙。","“These will be good!” cried Neb, going to the sailor’s aid."
"“我就说嘛，这座岛上除了烟草什么都有！”潘克洛夫叹了口气，低语道。","“As I said, there is everything in this island, except tobacco!” muttered Pencroft with a sigh."
"因为河里满是小龙虾，所以捕虾还不到五分钟时间。袋子里装满了这种甲壳动物，它们的壳是钴蓝色的。居民们继续前行。","The fishing did not take five minutes, for the crayfish were swarming in the creek.A bag was filled with the crustaceae, whose shells were of a cobalt blue.The settlers then pushed on."
"沿着岸边行走比在森林中行走更快、更容易。他们时不时地会发现体型较大的动物的痕迹，那是它们来河边喝水时留下的，但是实际上却一只也没有看到。很明显，那只曾硌掉潘克洛夫一颗牙齿的西貒，不是在这片森林里中弹的。","They advanced more rapidly and easily along the bank of the river than in the forest.From time to time they came upon the traces of animals of a large size who had come to quench their thirst at the stream, but none were actually seen, and it was evidently not in this part of the forest that the peccary had received the bullet which had cost Pencroft a grinder."
"同时，考虑到这湍急的河流，哈丁认为他和同伴们离西海岸的距离，比预计的要远得多。事实上，在这个时候，如果河口距离这里只有几英里的路程，上涨的潮水就会使河水回流。但是，现在并没有出现这种情况，河水依旧照常流动。工程师很是吃惊，多次查看罗盘，以确信河流的某个拐角没有把他们重新带回远西森林。","In the meanwhile, considering the rapid current, Harding was led to suppose that he and his companions were much farther from the western coast than they had at first supposed.In fact, at this hour, the rising tide would have turned back the current of the creek, if its mouth had only been a few miles distant.Now, this effect was not produced, and the water pursued its natural course.The engineer was much astonished at this, and frequently consulted his compass, to assure himself that some turn of the river was not leading them again into the Far West."
"但是，河面渐渐变宽了，而且河水也不那么湍急了。右岸的树木和左岸一样生长紧密，要想透过它们看到什么是不可能的。但是，这片树林里显然没有人居住，因为托普并没有叫，如果附近有任何陌生人出现，这只机警的动物都会做出反应。","However, the creek gradually widened and its waters became less tumultuous.The trees on the right bank were as close together as on the left bank, and it was impossible to distinguish anything beyond them; but these masses of wood were evidently uninhabited, for Top did not bark, and the intelligent animal would not have failed to signal the presence of any stranger in the neighborhood."
"十点半的时候，稍稍在前的赫伯特突然停了下来，赛勒斯·哈丁吃了一惊，接着听到他大喊：","At half-past ten, to the great surprise of Cyrus Harding, Herbert, who was a little in front, suddenly stopped and exclaimed,—"
"“大海！”","“The sea!”"
"几分钟后，小岛的整个西海岸就展现在居民面前了。","In a few minutes more, the whole western shore of the island lay extended before the eyes of the settlers."
"但是这里和他们被命运抛到的东海岸有着很大不同。这里没有花岗石峭壁，没有岩石，甚至也没有沙滩。森林一直延伸到海边，高大的树木有树枝垂落到海面上，被海水冲刷着。这与普通的自然形成的海岸不同，既没有广阔的沙滩，也没有成堆的岩石，而是一道美丽的边界，上面生长着许多美丽的树木。海岸比海平面要高一点，在这块由花岗石地基托起的肥沃的土壤上，美丽的森林树木似乎和小岛内陆上的一样茁壮。","But what a contrast between this and the eastern coast, upon which chance had first thrown them.No granite cliff, no rocks, not even a sandy beach.The forest reached the shore, and the tall trees bending over the water were beaten by the waves.It was not such a shore as is usually formed by nature, either by extending a vast carpet of sand, or by grouping masses of rock, but a beautiful border consisting of the most splendid trees.The bank was raised a little above the level of the sea, and on this luxuriant soil, supported by a granite base, the fine forest trees seemed to be as firmly planted as in the interior of the island."
"拓荒者们来到了海岸上一个不重要的的小海港，这个海港勉强能容下两三只渔船。它是作为通向刚才那条新河流的海峡，奇怪的是河水并不是通过一个缓坡汇入大海，而是从40多英尺高的地方落下，这也就解释了为什么他们刚才在河上感觉不到涨潮。事实上，即便是太平洋的潮水达到顶峰的时候也无法涨到这条河的高度，而且即使再过几百万年，潮水也无法冲垮花岗岩，形成一个和大海相接的河口，这是毫无疑问的。","The colonists were then on the shore of an unimportant little harbor, which would scarcely have contained even two or three fishing-boats.It served as a neck to the new creek, of which the curious thing was that its waters, instead of joining the sea by a gentle slope, fell from a height of more than forty feet, which explained why the rising tide was not felt up the stream.In fact, the tides of the Pacific, even at their maximum elevation, could never reach the level of the river, and, doubtless, millions of years would pass before the water would have worn away the granite and hollowed a practicable mouth."
"大家一致同意给这条小河命名叫“瀑布河”。此外，森林又向北面延伸了约两英里，那边的树木越来越稀疏，再远处，风景如画的高地几乎连接成一条南北方向的直线。相反，瀑布河与爬虫角之间的海岸上，长满了树木这些美丽的树，有的笔直，其他的垂到海面上，翻滚的海浪冲刷着它们的根部。现在，他们即将开始搜索这片海岸了，即整个盘蛇半岛。因为只有这片海岸能为落难者提供安身之处，另一侧的荒地和不毛之地肯定不予考虑。","It was settled that the name of Falls River should be given to this stream.Beyond, towards the north, the forest border was prolonged for a space of nearly two miles; then the trees became scarcer, and beyond that again the picturesque heights described a nearly straight line, which ran north and south.On the contrary, all the part of the shore between Falls River and Reptile End was a mass of wood, magnificent trees, some straight, others bent, so that the long sea-swell bathed their roots.Now, it was this coast, that is, all the Serpentine Peninsula, that was to be explored, for this part of the shore offered a refuge to castaways, which the other wild and barren side must have refused."
"天气清朗，纳布和潘克洛夫在一个小山丘上准备早饭，在那里可以看得很远。然而，一只船也看不到，沿着海岸，目所及之处什么也没有。但是，除非对这片海岸到盘蛇半岛的尽头进行搜索后，工程师是不会理所当然地接受任何结论的。","The weather was fine and clear, and from a height of a hillock on which Neb and Pencroft had arranged breakfast, a wide view was obtained.There was, however, not a sail in sight; nothing could be seen along the shore as far as the eye could reach.But the engineer would take nothing for granted until he had explored the coast to the very extremity of the Serpentine Peninsula."
"他们很快吃完了早饭，十一点半的时候，赛勒斯·哈丁下令启程。居民们没有在峭壁上或是沿着沙滩行进，而只能依然在树下行走，这样才能继续在海岸上搜索。","Breakfast was soon despatched, and at half-past eleven the captain gave the signal for departure.Instead of proceeding over the summit of a cliff or along a sandy beach, the settlers were obliged to remain under cover of the trees so that they might continue on the shore."
"瀑布河与爬虫角之间的距离约有12英里。如果是在平地上不慌不忙地行走，大概四个小时就可以走完这段距离。但是现在他们需要两倍的时间，因为要绕过树木，劈开灌木丛，砍断缠绕的藤蔓。他们每走一步都被挡住，这些障碍大大延长了他们行进的时间。","The distance which separated Falls River from Reptile End was about twelve miles.It would have taken the settlers four hours to do this, on a clear ground and without hurrying themselves; but as it was they needed double the time, for what with trees to go round, bushes to cut down, and creepers to chop away, they were impeded at every step, these obstacles greatly lengthening their journey."
"然而，依然没有什么迹象显示这里最近有船只失事。就像吉丁·史佩莱注意到的那样，事实上，失事船只的残骸有可能漂到海里去了。因为没有发现什么迹象，他们也不可以想当然地认为海边没有过遇难的船只。","There was, however, nothing to show that a shipwreck had taken place recently.It is true that, as Gideon Spilett observed, any remains of it might have drifted out to sea, and they must not take it for granted that because they could find no traces of it, a ship had not been castaway on the coast."
"记者的观点是正确的，而且子弹事件也说明在最近的三个月内，一定有人在林肯岛上开过枪。","The reporter’s argument was just, and besides, the incident of the bullet proved that a shot must have been fired in Lincoln Island within three months."
"已经五点钟了，居民们距盘蛇半岛的尽头处还有两英里。很明显，在到达爬虫角之后，哈丁和同伴们来不及在天黑之前返回慈悲河口的宿营地了。因而，他们需要在海角上过夜了。但幸运的是，他们不缺食物。虽然海岸上没有什么动物，但是鸟类却不少，有啄木鸟、锦鸡、角雉、松鸡、猩猩鹦鹉、鹦鹉、美冠鹦鹉、雉鸡、鸽子以及一百只其他种类的鸟。这里的树上都有鸟巢，鸟巢里满是扑棱着翅膀的鸟。","It was already five o’clock, and there were still two miles between the settlers and the extremity of the Serpentine Peninsula.It was evident that after having reached Reptile End, Harding and his companions would not have time to return before dark to their encampment near the source of the Mercy.It would therefore be necessary to pass the night on the promontory.But they had no lack of provisions, which was lucky, for there were no animals on the shore, though birds, on the contrary, abound—jacamars, couroucous, tragopans, grouse, lories, parrots, cockatoos, pheasants, pigeons, and a hundred others.There was not a tree without a nest, and not a nest which was not full of flapping wings."
"快七点钟的时候，疲惫的探险者们到达了爬虫角。这里是海边森林的尽头，海岸也呈现出一幅海岸常有的景象：岩石、暗礁和沙子。探险者们或许能在这里找到些什么，但是黑夜降临，他们不得不推迟到第二天，再进一步探索了。","Towards seven o’clock the weary explorers arrived at Reptile End.Here the seaside forest ended, and the shore resumed the customary appearance of a coast, with rocks, reefs, and sands.It was possible that something might be found here, but darkness came on, and the further exploration had to be put off to the next day."
"潘克洛夫和赫伯特急忙为大家寻找合适的地方宿营。在远西森林尽头处的几棵树中，少年发现了几丛密密的竹林。","Pencroft and Herbert hastened on to find a suitable place for their camp.Among the last trees of the forest of the Far West, the boy found several thick clumps of bamboos."
"“好啊，”他说，“这是有价值的发现。”","“Good,” said he; “this is a valuable discovery.”"
"“有价值？”潘克洛夫问道。","“Valuable?” returned Pencroft."
"“当然了，”少年答道，“我可以这么说，潘克洛夫，竹皮如果劈成柔韧的板条，可以用来编制篮子；如果捣成浆糊，可以制作中国式的纸张；根据竹竿的大小，可以把它们制成手杖和烟管，并且还可以用来导水；大的竹子还是极好的建材，因为它们轻便、结实，而且从不会受到虫的侵害。我还要补充一点，把竹子在竹节处锯成两半，并保留竹节处的横向薄层做底，就可以做成实用的杯子了，这在中国是很常用的。不！你不会在乎这个的。但是——”","“Certainly,” replied Herbert.“I may say, Pencroft, that the bark of the bamboo, cut into flexible laths, is used for making baskets; that this bark, mashed into a paste, is used for the manufacture of Chinese paper; that the stalks furnish, according to their size, canes and pipes and are used for conducting water; that large bamboos make excellent material for building, being light and strong, and being never attacked by insects.I will add that by sawing the bamboo in two at the joint, keeping for the bottom the part of the transverse film which forms the joint, useful cups are obtained, which are much in use among the Chinese.No! you don’t care for that.But—”"
"“但是什么？”","“But what?”"
"“但是如果你不知道，我可以告诉你，在印度，这些竹子就和芦笋一样，是可以吃的。”","“But I can tell you, if you are ignorant of it, that in India these bamboos are eaten like asparagus.”"
"“30英尺高的芦笋！”水手喊道，“好吃吗？”","“Asparagus thirty feet high!” exclaimed the sailor.“And are they good?”"
"“好吃极了，”赫伯特答道，“只是他们吃的并不是30英尺高的竹竿，而是嫩芽。”","“Excellent,” replied Herbert.“Only it is not the stems of thirty feet high which are eaten, but the young shoots.”"
"“太好了，孩子，太好了！”潘克洛夫回答道。","“Perfect, my boy, perfect!” replied Pencroft."
"“我还要补充一点，把嫩竹芯的髓泡在醋里，可以制成很好的泡菜。”","“I will also add that the pith of the young stalks, preserved in vinegar, makes a good pickle.”"
"“越来越好了，赫伯特！”","“Better and better, Herbert!”"
"“最后一点，竹子里流出的甜汁液，可以制成非常可口的饮料。”","“And lastly, that the bamboos exude a sweet liquor which can be made into a very agreeable drink.”"
"“完了吗？”水手问道。","“Is that all?” asked the sailor."
"“完了！”","“That is all!”"
"“这些竹子能不能做抽烟之用呢？“","“And they don’t happen to do for smoking?”"
"“不能，可怜的潘克洛夫。”","“No, my poor Pencroft.”"
"赫伯特和水手不久就找到了过夜的地方。岩石上有许多空洞，这一定是由于海水在西南风的作用下，猛烈拍击岩石形成的，他们可以在此安身，躲避夜里的凉气。但是，正当他们准备进入到其中一个洞穴时，一声洪亮的咆哮引起了他们的注意。","Herbert and the sailor had not to look long for a place in which to pass the night.The rocks, which must have been violently beaten by the sea under the influence of the winds of the southwest, presented many cavities in which shelter could be found against the night air.But just as they were about to enter one of these caves a loud roaring arrested them."
"“后退！”潘克洛夫喊道，“我们的枪里只装满了小颗子弹，那些能如此大声咆哮的野兽，对子弹不会在乎，就像不在乎盐粒一样！”这时，一只雄壮的动物出现在洞口，水手一把抓住赫伯特的胳膊，将他拽到岩石的后面。","“Back!” cried Pencroft.“Our guns are only loaded with small shot, and beasts which can roar as loud as that would care no more for it than for grains of salt!”And the sailor, seizing Herbert by the arm, dragged him behind a rock, just as a magnificent animal showed itself at the entrance of the cavern."
"这是一只大小至少和亚洲虎差不多的美洲虎，也就是说，它从头顶至尾巴头有五英尺长。它黄色的毛上有着一道道斑纹和匀称的椭圆形黑色斑点，而它的胸膛却的白色形成对比。赫伯特认出来那是老虎凶猛的的劲敌，和最大的狼的对手美洲狮一样可怕！","It was a jaguar of a size at least equal to its Asiatic congeners, that is to say, it measured five feet from the extremity of its head to the beginning of its tail.The yellow color of its hair was relieved by streaks and regular oblong spots of black, which contrasted with the white of its chest.Herbert recognized it as the ferocious rival of the tiger, as formidable as the puma, which is the rival of the largest wolf!"
"美洲虎往前走了一步，用像在燃烧的双眼盯着他，它的毛发都竖立起来，仿佛这并不是它第一次闻到人的味道。","The jaguar advanced and gazed around him with blazing eyes, his hair bristling as if this was not the first time he had scented men."
"这时，记者从岩石后面走了出来，赫伯特以为他没有看到美洲虎，正想要冲过去，吉丁·史佩莱做了个手势，示意他在原地别动。这不是他第一次遇到老虎了，他走到离老虎有十英尺处停下，一动不动，把枪放在肩上，肌肉没有动。美洲虎正要聚集全身力气跳过来的时候，记者开枪打中了它的眼睛，很快它便倒地身亡了。","At this moment the reporter appeared round a rock, and Herbert, thinking that he had not seen the jaguar, was about to rush towards him, when Gideon Spilett signed to him to remain where he was.This was not his first tiger, and advancing to within ten feet of the animal he remained motionless, his gun to his shoulder, without moving a muscle.The jaguar collected itself for a spring, but at that moment a shot struck it in the eyes, and it fell dead."
"赫伯特和潘克洛夫马上朝美洲虎冲了过来。纳布和哈丁也跑了过来，他们凝视了一会儿倒在地上的美洲虎，心想这美丽的皮毛用来装饰花岗石宫的大厅再好不过了。","Herbert and Pencroft rushed towards the jaguar.Neb and Harding also ran up, and they remained for some instants contemplating the animal as it lay stretched on the ground, thinking that its magnificent skin would be a great ornament to the hall at Granite House."
"“噢，史佩莱先生，我是多么羡慕又忌妒你啊！”赫伯特出于自然流露的一阵仰慕之情喊道。","“Oh, Mr. Spilett, how I admire and envy you!” cried Herbert, in a fit of very natural enthusiasm."
"“哦，孩子，”记者回答道，“你也可以做到的。”","“Well, my boy,” replied the reporter, “you could have done the same.”"
"“我！这么冷静！”","“I! with such coolness!—”"
"“赫伯特，你就把这只美洲虎想象成一只野兔，这样你就会尽可能冷静地朝它开枪了。”","“Imagine to yourself, Herbert, that the jaguar is only a hare, and you would fire as quietly as possible.”"
"“那是，”潘克洛夫插嘴道，“它并不比一只野兔更危险！”","“That is,” rejoined Pencroft, “that it is not more dangerous than a hare!”"
"“现在，”吉丁·史佩莱回答道，“既然美洲虎已经把它的窝让出来了，朋友们，我们为何不占有它过夜吧。”","“And now,” said Gideon Spilett, “since the jaguar has left its abode, I do not see, my friends, why we should not take possession of it for the night.”"
"“但是可能还会有其他野兽过来啊。”潘克洛夫说道。","“But others may come,” said Pencroft."
"“在洞口点一堆火就可以了，”记者说道，“没有野兽敢跨进门口的。”","“It will be enough to light a fire at the entrance of the cavern,” said the reporter, “and no wild beasts will dare to cross the threshold.”"
"“那就快进虎窝里去吧！”水手拖着老虎的尸体回答道。","“Into the jaguar’s house, then!” replied the sailor, dragging after him the body of the animal."
"纳布把虎皮剥了下来，而他的同伴们已经从森林里捡了足够的干柴，堆在洞口。","While Neb skinned the jaguar, his companions collected an abundant supply of dry wood from the forest, which they heaped up at the cave."
"赛勒斯·哈丁看到竹丛，就砍了一些竹子回来，和其他燃料混在一起。","Cyrus Harding, seeing the clump of bamboos, cut a quantity, which he mingled with the other fuel."
"做完这些后，他们进到洞穴里面，地上散落着白骨，他们小心地在枪膛里面装上子弹，以防突然袭击。他们吃过晚饭，把洞口的那堆木柴点着，然后就躺下来休息。这时，一个正常的爆炸声，确切地讲是一连串的爆炸声，划破了寂静！那是竹子燃烧的声响，当火焰烧到竹子的时候，就会像爆竹那样发出噼里啪啦的声音。这爆炸声足以吓退那些最为大胆的野兽。","This done, they entered the grotto, of which the floor was strewn with bones, the guns were carefully loaded, in case of a sudden attack, they had supper, and then just before they lay down to rest, the heap of wood piled at the entrance was set fire to.Immediately, a regular explosion, or rather a series of reports, broke the silence!The noise was caused by the bamboos, which, as the flames reached them, exploded like fireworks.The noise was enough to terrify even the boldest of wild beasts."
"这种炸响的方法并不是工程师发明的，根据马可·波罗记载，中亚地区的鞑靼人在很多个世纪以前，就已经用这种方法把凶猛的野兽驱赶出去。","It was not the engineer who had invented this way of causing loud explosions, for, according to Marco Polo, the Tartars have employed it for many centuries to drive away from their encampments the formidable wild beasts of Central Asia."
"第五章","Chapter 5"
"经由他们处置，美洲虎礼貌地让出了自己的窝，于是赛勒斯·哈丁和同伴们在洞里像天真的土拨鼠一样睡了。","Cyrus Harding and his companions slept like innocent marmots in the cave which the jaguar had so politely left at their disposal."
"太阳升起来的时候，他们一行人已经到了海角尽头的海岸上，大家注视着地平线，其中有三分之二已经显现出来了。工程师最后一次确信，海上既没有航行的船只，也没有失事船只的残骸，甚至用望远镜也没有发现什么可疑的迹象。","At sunrise all were on the shore at the extremity of the promontory, and their gaze was directed towards the horizon, of which two-thirds of the circumference were visible.For the last time the engineer could ascertain that not a sail nor the wreck of a ship was on the sea, and even with the telescope nothing suspicious could be discovered."
"海岸上也没有发现什么，至少是在海角南面三英里内，笔直的海岸线上没有什么。而在那之外，海滨的远处都是高地，甚至从盘蛇半岛的尽头处望去，也看不到爬虫角。","There was nothing either on the shore, at least, in the straight line of three miles which formed the south side of the promontory, for beyond that, rising ground had the rest of the coast, and even from the extremity of the Serpentine Peninsula Claw Cape could not be seen."
"小岛的南部海岸仍旧有待他们前去探索。现在他们是不是应该马上出发，利用这一整天的时间前去探索呢？","The southern coast of the island still remained to be explored.Now should they undertake it immediately, and devote this day to it?"
"这不在他们原先的计划之内。事实上，他们在慈悲河口下船的时候，就一致同意查看过西海岸后就回来，乘船经由慈悲河返回花岗石宫。哈丁原先认为，无论是一艘遇难的船只，还是一只正常航行的船舰，都能在西海岸找到容身之所。但是现在，正如他看到的那样，这里并没有理想的停泊地方，于是，他希望可以去南面继续寻找他们在西面没有找到的东西。","This was not included in their first plan.In fact, when the boat was abandoned at the sources of the Mercy, it had been agreed that after having surveyed the west coast, they should go back to it, and return to Granite House by the Mercy.Harding then thought that the western coast would have offered refuge, either to a ship in distress, or to a vessel in her regular course; but now, as he saw that this coast presented no good anchorage, he wished to seek on the south what they had not been able to find on the west."
"吉丁·史佩莱也提议继续探险，这样他们猜测的沉船问题才有可能得到彻底解决，他问半岛的尽头距爪角有多远。","Gideon Spilett proposed to continue the exploration, that the question of the supposed wreck might be completely settled, and he asked at what distance Claw Cape might be from the extremity of the peninsula."
"“大约有30英里吧，”工程师回答道，“如果把海岸线曲折的部分也考虑进去。”","“About thirty miles,” replied the engineer, “if we take into consideration the curvings of the coast.”"
"“30英里！”史佩莱回应道，“这将是很长的行进。不过，我想我们可以从南海岸返回花岗石宫。”","“Thirty miles!” returned Spilett.“That would be a long day’s march.Nevertheless, I think that we should return to Granite House by the south coast.”"
"“但是，”赫伯特说，“从爪角到花岗石宫又至少有十英里。”","“But,” observed Herbert, “from Claw Cape to Granite House there must be at least another ten miles."
"“总共就是40英里了，”工程师回答道，“不要犹豫了，快动身吧。至少，我们应该到未知的海岸上查看一下，这样就不用再次探险了。”","“Make it forty miles in all,” replied the engineer, “and do not hesitate to do it.At least we should survey the unknown shore, and then we shall not have to begin the exploration again.”"
"“很好，”潘克洛夫说道，“但是我们的船要怎么办呢？”","“Very good,” said Pencroft.“But the boat?”"
"“它已经在慈悲河发源地呆了一天了，”吉丁·史佩莱说道，“那再呆上两天也无妨！而且，我们也没理由认为小岛上有小偷出没！”","“The boat has remained by itself for one day at the sources of the Mercy,” replied Gideon Spilett; “it may just as well stay there two days!As yet, we have had no reason to think that the island is infested by thieves!”"
"“但是，”水手说道，“我一想起那只海龟的事，就觉得不能这样肯定。”","“Yet,” said the sailor, “when I remember the history of the turtle, I am far from confident of that.”"
"“海龟！海龟！”记者回答道，“难道你不知道是海水把它翻过来了吗？”","“The turtle! the turtle!” replied the reporter.“Don’t you know that the sea turned it over?”"
"“这谁知道呢？”工程师低语道。","“Who knows?” murmured the engineer."
"“但是——”纳布说。","“But,—” said Neb."
"纳布很明显有话要说，但是他只张了张嘴，却什么也没有说。","Neb had evidently something to say, for he opened his mouth to speak and yet said nothing."
"“你想说什么，纳布？”工程师问道。","“What do you want to say, Neb?” asked the engineer."
"“如果我们沿着海岸回到爪角，”纳布回答说，“再次绕过爪角，就会被——”","“If we return by the shore to Claw Cape,” replied Neb, “after having doubled the Cape, we shall be stopped—”"
"“被慈悲河拦住！当然了，”赫伯特回答道，“而我们既没有桥也没有船可以过河。”","“By the Mercy! of course,” replied Herbert, “and we shall have neither bridge nor boat by which to cross.”"
"“但是，上尉，”潘克洛夫补充道，“在河里放上一些漂浮的树干，我们就可以毫不费力地过去了。”","“But, captain,” added Pencroft, “with a few floating trunks we shall have no difficulty in crossing the river.”"
"“不要紧，”史佩莱说道，“如果我们想要轻松地到达远西森林，搭座桥会有用！”","“Never mind,” said Spilett, “it will be useful to construct a bridge if we wish to have an easy access to the Far West!”"
"“一座桥！”潘克洛夫喊道，“是啊，上尉不是最好的工程师吗？如果我们需要，他可以帮我们造桥。至于今天晚上如何把你们衣不沾水地送到慈悲河的另一岸去，就看我的吧。我们还有一天的食物，而且也可以打到很多猎物。前进吧！”","“A bridge!” cried Pencroft.“Well, is not the captain the best engineer in his profession?He will make us a bridge when we want one.As to transporting you this evening to the other side of the Mercy, and that without wetting one thread of your clothes, I will take care of that.We have provisions for another day, and besides we can get plenty of game.Forward!”"
"记者的提议得到了水手的强力支持，也得到了大家的普遍认可，因为每个人都想解除心中的疑虑，从爪角回去后，这次探险就可以结束了。但是现在刻不容缓，因为40英里是一段很长的距离，而且他们也不能指望在天黑前回到花岗石宫。","The reporter’s proposal, so strongly seconded by the sailor, received general approbation, for each wished to have their doubts set at rest, and by returning by Claw Cape the exploration would he ended.But there was not an hour to lose, for forty miles was a long march, and they could not hope to reach Granite House before night."
"早上六点的时候，他们这小队人马又出发了。为了谨慎起见，他们在枪膛里装上子弹，而托普在前面打头阵，并听话地搜寻着森林的边缘地带。","At six o’clock in the morning the little band set out.As a precaution the guns were loaded with ball, and Top, who led the van, received orders to beat about the edge of the forest."
"在半岛尾端的海角尽头，环形的海岸线有五英里长，他们很快就搜查过了。但即便是万分仔细地查看，也没有发现任何以前或是新近登陆留下的痕迹，没有碎片残骸，没有宿营的痕迹，没有燃烧的灰烬，甚至连一只脚印也没有。","From the extremity of the promontory which formed the tail of the peninsula the coast was rounded for a distance of five miles, which was rapidly passed over, without even the most minute investigations bringing to light the least trace of any old or recent landings; no debris, no mark of an encampment, no cinders of a fire, nor even a footprint!"
"从居民们现在所处半岛的位置，可以朝西南方向看过去。离海岸25英里处就是爪角，它在清晨的薄雾中看起来有点模糊，而且由于海市蜃楼的影响，它看起来仿佛悬于陆地和大海之间。","From the point of the peninsula on which the settlers now were their gaze could extend along the southwest.Twenty-five miles off the coast terminated in the Claw Cape, which loomed dimly through the morning mists, and which, by the phenomenon of the mirage, appeared as if suspended between land and water."
"在他们现在所处的位置与另一侧的广阔海湾之间，海岸由三部分组成：先是一块低地，边上长有树木；中间一部分的海岸比较曲折，有些突出的尖角直插入大海；最后是一片黑色的岩石，凌乱成堆，独特如画，形成了爪角。","Between the place occupied by the colonists and the other side of the immense bay, the shore was composed, first, of a tract of low land, bordered in the background by trees; then the shore became more irregular, projecting sharp points into the sea, and finally ended in the black rocks which, accumulated in picturesque disorder, formed Claw Cape."
"小岛这一带的地形就是如此，居民们一看就立刻停了下来。","Such was the development of this part of the island, which the settlers took in at a glance, while stopping for an instant."
"“如果有船只航行到这里，”潘克洛夫说，“那肯定得迷路。到处都是沙洲和暗礁！糟糕的地方！”","“If a vessel ran in here,” said Pencroft, “she would certainly be lost.Sandbanks and reefs everywhere!Bad quarters!”"
"“但是至少也会有船只的遗骸吧。”记者说道。","“But at least something would be left of the ship,” observed the reporter."
"“岩石上或许会留下木片，但是沙滩上却不会有。”水手回答道。","“There might be pieces of wood on the rocks, but nothing on the sands,” replied the sailor."
"“为什么？”","“Why?”"
"“因为沙子要比岩石危险得多，他们可以吞没落在上面的一切东西。只要几天时间，一具几百吨重的船体就会完全消失在那里！”","“Because the sands are still more dangerous than the rocks, for they swallow up everything that is thrown on them.In a few days the hull of a ship of several hundred tons would disappear entirely in there!”"
"“那么，潘克洛夫，”工程师问道，“如果有船只在这一带海岸失事，现在找不到任何它的遗骸的痕迹，也不足为奇吗？”","“So, Pencroft,” asked the engineer, “if a ship has been wrecked on these banks, is it not astonishing that there is now no trace of her remaining?”"
"“是的，哈丁先生，加上时间和风暴的作用。但即便是这样，总该有些桅杆或是横杆抛到海浪打不着的海滩上，要不然就太奇怪了。”","“No, captain, with the aid of time and tempest.However, it would be surprising, even in this case, that some of the masts or spars should not have been thrown on the beach, out of reach of the waves.”"
"“我们还是继续搜寻吧。”赛勒斯·哈丁说道。","“Let us go on with our search, then,” returned Cyrus Harding."
"一点的时候，拓荒者们到达了华盛顿湾的另一面，他们现在已经走了20英里了。","At one o’clock the colonists arrived at the other side of Washington Bay, they having now gone a distance of twenty miles."
"接着，他们停下来吃早饭。","They then halted for breakfast."
"从这里开始，海岸变得曲折起来，上面布满岩石和沙洲。翻滚的巨浪拍打在海湾的岩石上，溅起泡沫，形成一道水线。从这个角度向爪角望过去，夹在森林边缘和暗礁之间的海滩十分狭窄。","Here began the irregular coast, covered with lines of rocks and sandbanks.The long sea-swell could be seen breaking over the rocks in the bay, forming a foamy fringe.From this point to Claw Cape the beach was very narrow between the edge of the forest and the reefs."
"大量的岩石挡在海滩上，使他们现在的行走越来越艰难。花岗石峭壁也越来越高，只能看到上面绿色的树顶。","Walking was now more difficult, on account of the numerous rocks which encumbered the beach.The granite cliff also gradually increased in height, and only the green tops of the trees which crowned it could be seen."
"他们休息了半个小时后，又开始前行，而且他们查看了岩石间的每一处。无论何时有物体吸引注意，潘克洛夫和纳布甚至冲到海浪里去。但是他们什么也没找到，是一些形状怪异的岩石欺骗了他们。但他们可以确定的是，这里有很多食用贝类，然而现在最紧要的是要在慈悲河两岸间建立方便的通行方式，并且能够完善运输条件，否则这些对于他们也没什么大用处。","After half an hour’s rest, the settlers resumed their journey, and not a spot among the rocks was left unexamined.Pencroft and Neb even rushed into the surf whenever any object attracted their attention.But they found nothing, some curious formations of the rocks having deceived them.They ascertained, however, that eatable shellfish abounded there, but these could not be of any great advantage to them until some easy means of communication had been established between the two banks of the Mercy, and until the means of transport had been perfected."
"他们在这片海岸上没有找到任何与猜想的失事船只有关的东西，虽然任何一样有价值的东西，例如船体，很容易就会看到，任何一根桅杆和木头都有可能被冲上岸，就像在20英里之外找到的那只箱子一样。但他们还是一无所获。","Nothing therefore which threw any light on the supposed wreck could be found on this shore, yet an object of any importance, such as the hull of a ship, would have been seen directly, or any of her masts and spans would have been washed on shore, just as the chest had been, which was found twenty miles from here.But there was nothing."
"将近三点钟的时候，哈丁和同伴们来到了一条令人心旷神怡的小溪边。这里形成了一个天然的海港，在大海上是看不到的，它通过一条窄窄的海峡和大海相连。","Towards three o’clock Harding and his companions arrived at a snug little creek.It formed quite a natural harbor, invisible from the sea, and was entered by a narrow channel."
"小溪后面的岩石圈由于剧烈的震荡裂开了，沿着其中一个断裂口，经过一个平缓的斜坡，可以到达上面的高地，这块高地距爪角至少约有10英里，因此与眺望岗的直线距离为四英里。吉丁·史佩莱向同伴们提议，在这里休息一会儿。大家欣然同意了，因为长时间跋涉他们都饿坏了，虽然还没到往常的吃饭时间，但是大家都想块肉，补充一下能量。这顿午饭会帮助他们坚持到晚饭时间，因为他们打算回到花岗石宫再吃晚饭。几分钟后，居民们坐在一丛美丽的海松下，纳布从袋中拿出食物，大家就狼吞虎咽地吃了起来。","At the back of this creek some violent convulsion had torn up the rocky border, and a cutting, by a gentle slope, gave access to an upper plateau, which might be situated at least ten miles from Claw Cape, and consequently four miles in a straight line from Prospect Heights.Gideon Spilett proposed to his companions that they should make a halt here.They agreed readily, for their walk had sharpened their appetites; and although it was not their usual dinner-hour, no one refused to strengthen himself with a piece of venison.This luncheon would sustain them until their supper, which they intended to take at Granite House.In a few minutes the settlers, seated under a clump of fine sea-pines, were devouring the provisions which Neb produced from his bag."
"这块高地比海平面高出50到60英尺。在上面可以看到很远的地方，但是爪角之外就只能看到联合湾。在这里也看不到小岛和眺望岗，而且也不可能看到，因为隆起的高地和树林形成的屏障遮住了北方的视野。","This spot was raised from fifty to sixty feet above the level of the sea.The view was very extensive, but beyond the cape it ended in Union Bay.Neither the islet nor Prospect Heights was visible, and could not be from thence, for the rising ground and the curtain of trees closed the northern horizon."
"不用说，虽然探险者们可以看到广阔的海面，工程师甚至依靠望远镜来拓展视野，但是依旧没有发现船的影子。","It is useless to add that notwithstanding the wide extent of sea which the explorers could survey, and though the engineer swept the horizon with his glass, no vessel could be found."
"当然他们也同样仔细地查看了海岸，从海水边缘到峭壁，甚至用上了仪器，可是仍然一无所获。","The shore was of course examined with the same care from the edge of the water to the cliff, and nothing could be discovered even with the aid of the instrument."
"“好吧，”吉丁·史佩莱说道，“看来我们大可安心，没有人会和我们起争执，抢林肯岛了！”","“Well,” said Gideon Spilett, “it seems we must make up our minds to console ourselves with thinking that no one will come to dispute with us the possession of Lincoln Island!”"
"“但是那颗子弹，”赫伯特喊道，“不是凭空想象出来的，我想！”","“But the bullet,” cried Herbert.“That was not imaginary, I suppose!”"
"“见鬼，当然不是！”潘克洛夫想起他那颗被硌掉的牙齿，大喊。","“Hang it, no!” exclaimed Pencroft, thinking of his absent tooth."
"“那这要作何结论呢？”记者问道。","“Then what conclusion may be drawn?” asked the reporter."
"“是这样，”工程师回答道，“三个月或更久之前，一艘船，主动或者被迫地，来到了这里。”","“This,” replied the engineer, “that three months or more ago, a vessel, either voluntarily or not, came here.”"
"“什么！赛勒斯，你承认这艘船被吞没了，而且没有留下任何痕迹吗？”记者喊道。","“What! then you admit, Cyrus, that she was swallowed up without leaving any trace?” cried the reporter."
"“不，亲爱的史佩莱。但是你想，如果真的有人在小岛上登陆，看起来他现在同样有可能离开了。”","“No, my dear Spilett; but you see that if it is certain that a human being set foot on the island, it appears no less certain that he has now left it.”"
"“嗯，如果我理解得没错，上尉，”赫伯特说道，“那艘船又离开了？”","“Then, if I understand you right, captain,” said Herbert, “the vessel has left again?”"
"“显然是这样。”","“Evidently.”"
"“那我们岂不是失去了一次可以返回国的机会？”纳布说道。","“And we have lost an opportunity to get back to our country?” said Neb."
"“恐怕是这样的。”","“I fear so.”"
"“那好，既然失去了这次机会，我们还是继续前进吧，这也是没有办法的事。”潘克洛夫说，他忽然很想念花岗石宫那个家了。","“Very well, since the opportunity is lost, let us go on; it can’t be helped,” said Pencroft, who felt home-sickness for Granite House."
"但他们正要起身的时候，忽然听到托普大声地吠叫，它从树林里跑了出来，嘴里衔了一块沾着污泥的脏布。","But just as they were rising, Top was heard loudly barking; and the dog issued from the wood, holding in his mouth a rag soiled with mud."
"纳布一把抓了过来。那是一块很结实的布！","Neb seized it.It was a piece of strong cloth!"
"托普仍然在狂吠，并且不停地走来走去，仿佛是想要主人跟它到森林里去。","Top still barked, and by his going and coming, seemed to invite his master to follow him into the forest."
"“这下可以解释那颗子弹了！”潘克洛夫喊道。","“Now there’s something to explain the bullet!” exclaimed Pencroft."
"“一个落难者！”赫伯特答道。","“A castaway!” replied Herbert."
"“说不定还受伤了！”纳布说道。","“Wounded, perhaps!” said Neb."
"“或者已经死了！”记者补充道。","“Or dead!” added the reporter."
"他们跟着托普，在森林边缘高高的松树间跑了起来。哈丁和同伴们还准备好了火器，以防不测。","All ran after the dog, among the tall pines on the border of the forest.Harding and his companions made ready their firearms, in case of an emergency."
"他们跟着托普跑到树林里来了，但令人失望的是，他们仍然没有看到有人来过的痕迹。灌木丛和藤蔓都没有动过，他们甚至不得不用斧子劈开一条道来，就像他们曾经在森林深处那样。很难想象会有什么人曾经到过这里，但是托普仍在来回奔跑，不像是在随意寻找什么东西，而像是有心追寻它的什么想法。","They advanced some way into the wood, but to their great disappointment, they as yet saw no signs of any human being having passed that way.Shrubs and creepers were uninjured, and they had even to cut them away with the axe, as they had done in the deepest recesses of the forest.It was difficult to fancy that any human creature had ever passed there, but yet Top went backward and forward, not like a dog who searches at random, but like a dog being endowed with a mind, who is following up an idea."
"七八分钟后，托普在一片空地上停了下来，周围都是高高的树木。居民们仔细看了看周围，但什么也没看到，灌木丛下、树林间什么都没有。","In about seven or eight minutes Top stopped in a glade surrounded with tall trees.The settlers gazed around them, but saw nothing, neither under the bushes nor among the trees."
"“怎么回事，托普？”赛勒斯·哈丁说道。","“What is the matter, Top?” said Cyrus Harding."
"托普叫得更大声了，它在一颗高大的松树下来回蹦跳。突然潘克洛夫大叫：“噢，太好了！上尉！”","Top barked louder, bounding about at the foot of a gigantic pine.All at once Pencroft shouted,—“Ho, splendid! capital!”"
"“是什么？”史佩莱问道。","“What is it?” asked Spilett."
"“我们一直是在海上或是陆地上寻找的失事船只！”","“We have been looking for a wreck at sea or on land!”"
"“怎么？”","“Well?”"
"“是这样，现在却在空中找到了！”","“Well; and here we’ve found one in the air!”"
"水手指着松树顶上挂着的一块大白布，托普刚才带给他们的是其中掉落下来的一小块。","And the sailor pointed to a great white rag, caught in the top of the pine, a fallen scrap of which the dog had brought to them."
"“但那不是船的残骸！”吉丁·史佩莱喊道。","“But that is not a wreck!” cried Gideon Spilett."
"“您再说一遍！”潘克洛夫回道。","“I beg your pardon!” returned Pencroft."
"“怎么？它是——”","“Why? is it—?”"
"“那是我们的飞船，我们的气球遗留下来的东西，它挂在上面，就在这棵树顶上！”","“It is all that remains of our airy boat, of our balloon, which has been caught up aloft there, at the top of that tree!”"
"潘克洛夫说的没错，他激动地欢呼着，说道——","Pencroft was not mistaken, and he gave vent to his feelings in a tremendous hurrah, adding,—"
"“那可是块好布呢！有了它，我们这几年就不缺亚麻布了。我们可以用它做成手帕和衬衫！哈，哈，史佩莱先生，对于树上都能长出衬衫来的小岛，你还能说些什么？”","“There is good cloth!There is what will furnish us with linen for years.There is what will make us handkerchiefs and shirts!Ha, ha, Mr. Spilett, what do you say to an island where shirts grow on the trees?”"
"这只气球在最后一次弹回空中，又降落到这个岛上，并且又给机会让他们再次找到，无论他们是想要保持气球的现状，还是想用它再次脱逃，或者是利用那质量上好的几百码棉布，这对于林肯岛上的居民来讲都无疑是一件幸运的事。因而大家都和潘克洛夫一样高兴。","It was certainly a lucky circumstance for the settlers in Lincoln Island that the balloon, after having made its last bound into the air, had fallen on the island and thus given them the opportunity of finding it again, whether they kept the case under its present form, or whether they wished to attempt another escape by it, or whether they usefully employed the several hundred yards of cotton, which was of fine quality.Pencroft’s joy was therefore shared by all."
"但现在要做的就是从树上把残留的气球取下来，保管好，这可不是件轻松的事。纳布、赫伯特和水手爬到树顶上，想尽办法把已经瘪了的气球取了下来。","But it was necessary to bring down the remains of the balloon from the tree, to place it in security, and this was no slight task.Neb, Herbert, and the sailor, climbing to the summit of the tree, used all their skill to disengage the now reduced balloon."
"这个过程持续了两个小时，他们不仅把带有阀门、弹簧和黄铜零件的气球取了下来，而且还有网，也就是一大团绳索，还有绳环和铁锚都弄了下来。这只气球除了下面有些破损之外，其他部分都完好无损。","The operation lasted two hours, and then not only the case, with its valve, its springs, its brasswork, lay on the ground, but the net, that is to say a considerable quantity of ropes and cordage, and the circle and the anchor.The case, except for the fracture, was in good condition, only the lower portion being torn."
"这真是从天而降的财富啊。","It was a fortune which had fallen from the sky."
"“尽管如此，上尉，”水手说道，“如果我们决意离开这个小岛，也不会是乘气球离开，对吧？这种飞船不是我们想去哪就能去哪的，我们在这方面可是有经验了！这样吧，我们建造一艘约有20吨重的船，然后用那块布做一面主帆、一面前桅帆和一面三角帆。至于剩下的布可以用来做衣服。”","“All the same, captain,” said the sailor, “if we ever decide to leave the island, it won’t be in a balloon, will it?These airboats won’t go where we want them to go, and we have had some experience in that way!Look here, we will build a craft of some twenty tons, and then we can make a main-sail, a foresail, and a jib out of that cloth.As to the rest of it, that will help to dress us.”"
"“看看再说吧，潘克洛夫，”赛勒斯·哈丁回答道，“看看再说。”","“We shall see, Pencroft,” replied Cyrus Harding; “we shall see.”"
"“现在我们必须把它放到一个安全的地方。”纳布说。","“In the meantime, we must put it in a safe place,” said Neb."
"他们当然不可能把这一大块布、绳子和索具搬回花岗石宫，因为那是相当重的，在用合适的工具运走它之前，重要的是不能再任由风雨侵蚀这个宝贝。居民们在海岸上发现了一个很大的岩石洞穴，位置很好，不会透风也不会漏雨，于是就齐力把气球拖了进去。","They certainly could not think of carrying this load of cloth, ropes, and cordage, to Granite House, for the weight of it was very considerable, and while waiting for a suitable vehicle in which to convey it, it was of importance that this treasure should not be left longer exposed to the mercies of the first storm.The settlers, uniting their efforts, managed to drag it as far as the shore, where they discovered a large rocky cavity, which owing to its position could not be visited either by the wind or rain."
"“我们需要一个储物柜，现在已经有了，”潘克洛夫说道，“但是既然我们不能上锁，谨慎起见，还是把洞口遮住。我倒不是说两条腿的小偷，而是那些四只脚掌的！”","“We needed a locker, and now we have one,” said Pencroft; “but as we cannot lock it up, it will be prudent to hide the opening.I don’t mean from two-legged thieves, but from those with four paws!”"
"六点的时候，一切都收拾好了，他们给小溪起了一个十分恰当的名字“气球港”，然后就沿着爪角继续前进。潘克洛夫和工程师讨论了许多计划，大家一致同意尽快实施。当务之急是要在慈悲河上架桥，这样就可以轻松地到达小岛的南部了。然后必须把推车拉过来，把气球运回去，因为只用小舟是带不走的。此外，他们还要建造一只甲板船，而且潘克洛夫会进一步把它装备成单桅快速帆船，这样他们就能乘船环游小岛了，还有一些诸如此类的事。","At six o’clock, all was stowed away, and after having given the creek the very suitable name of “Port Balloon,” the settlers pursued their way along Claw Cape.Pencroft and the engineer talked of the different projects which it was agreed to put into execution with the briefest possible delay.It was necessary first of all to throw a bridge over the Mercy, so as to establish an easy communication with the south of the island; then the cart must be taken to bring back the balloon, for the canoe alone could not carry it, then they would build a decked boat, and Pencroft would rig it as a cutter, and they would be able to undertake voyages of circumnavigation round the island, etc."
"现在夜幕降临，居民们到达遗物角的时候，也就是到他们发现那只宝贵的箱子的地方时，天色已经黑了。","In the meanwhile night came on, and it was already dark when the settlers reached Flotsam Point, where they had found the precious chest."
"遗物角和花岗石宫之间的距离有四英里，居民们沿着海岸走到慈悲河口，到达慈悲河第一个拐角的时候，已经是午夜了。","The distance between Flotsam Point and Granite House was another four miles, and it was midnight when, after having followed the shore to the mouth of the Mercy, the settlers arrived at the first angle formed by the Mercy."
"河面有80英尺宽，很难渡过去，但先前潘克洛夫把解决这个难题的重任揽到自己身上，因而就不得不想办法做了。居民们经过一天的跋涉，已经疲惫不堪了。这次探险的行程太长了，而且把气球弄下来，更是没让手脚歇着。他们迫切地想要回到花岗石宫，吃点东西，休息一下，要是桥建好了，只需一刻钟他们就能回到家了。","There the river was eighty feet in breadth, which was awkward to cross, but as Pencroft had taken upon himself to conquer this difficulty, he was compelled to do it.The settlers certainly had reason to be pretty tired.The journey had been long, and the task of getting down the balloon had not rested either their arms or legs.They were anxious to reach Granite House to eat and sleep, and if the bridge had been constructed, in a quarter of an hour they would have been at home."
"夜色愈加黑暗。潘克洛夫准备建造一只木筏，让大家渡过慈悲河，以兑现自己的诺言。他和纳布拿着斧子，在河边选了两棵树，朝着根部就砍了起来。","The night was very dark.Pencroft prepared to keep his promise by constructing a sort of raft, on which to make the passage of the Mercy.He and Neb, armed with axes, chose two trees near the water, and began to attack them at the base."
"赛勒斯·哈丁和史佩莱坐在河边坐着，等同伴们需要的时候就去帮忙，赫伯特就在一边徘徊，但并没有走很远。在河边闲逛的少年突然跑了回来，指着慈悲河，喊道：","Cyrus Harding and Spilett, seated on the bank, waited till their companions were ready for their help, while Herbert roamed about, though without going to any distance.All at once, the lad, who had strolled by the river, came running back, and, pointing up the Mercy, exclaimed,—"
"“那漂的是什么？”","“What is floating there?”"
"潘克洛夫停下手中的活，看到一个难以辨认的物体在黑暗中移动。","Pencroft stopped working, and seeing an indistinct object moving through the gloom,—"
"“一只小舟！”他喊道。","“A canoe!” cried he."
"大家走近一看，都十分震惊，一只小船正顺流而下。","All approached, and saw to their extreme surprise, a boat floating down the current."
"“船啊，喂！”水手不假思索地大喊，都没想到这时最好保持沉默。","“Boat ahoy!” shouted the sailor, without thinking that perhaps it would be best to keep silence."
"没人回答。小船继续向前漂，离他们不到12英尺的时候，水手大喊：","No reply.The boat still drifted onward, and it was not more than twelve feet off, when the sailor exclaimed,—"
"“是我们自己的船！它从停泊的地方松开，顺流漂下来了。我得说它来得可真是凑巧。”","“But it is our own boat! she has broken her moorings, and floated down the current.I must say she has arrived very opportunely.”"
"“我们的船？”工程师低语道。","“Our boat?” murmured the engineer."
"潘克洛夫说得没错。那确实是他们的小舟，无疑是系船的绳子断了，它才从慈悲河发源地独自漂了过来。现在必须趁急流把小船冲离河口之前截住它，纳布和潘克洛夫巧妙地用一根长竿截住了小船。","Pencroft was right.It was indeed the canoe, of which the rope had undoubtedly broken, and which had come alone from the sources of the Mercy.It was very important to seize it before the rapid current should have swept it away out of the mouth of the river, but Neb and Pencroft cleverly managed this by means of a long pole."
"小舟靠岸了。工程师第一个跳了进去，他检查了一下绳子，发现绳子确实是在岩石上磨断的。","The canoe touched the shore.The engineer leaped in first, and found, on examining the rope, that it had been really worn through by rubbing against the rocks."
"“嗯，”记者低声对他说，“这真是奇怪。”","“Well,” said the reporter to him, in a low voice, “this is a strange thing.”"
"“确实很奇怪！”赛勒斯·哈丁回答道。","“Strange indeed!” returned Cyrus Harding."
"不管是不是很奇怪，他们确实是很幸运。赫伯特、记者纳布和潘克洛夫也相继跳上了船。绳子无疑是磨断的，但这件事奇怪是，小船刚好是他们在这里被他们截住，要是早一刻钟或是晚一刻钟，小船说不定就被冲进大海里去了。","Strange or not, it was very fortunate.Herbert, the reporter, Neb, and Pencroft, embarked in turn.There was no doubt about the rope having been worn through, but the astonishing part of the affair was, that the boat should arrive just at the moment when the settlers were there to seize it on its way, for a quarter of an hour earlier or later it would have been lost in the sea."
"他们现在生活的时代已经不相信鬼神了，否则他们准会认为这个小岛上有什么神灵出没，运用神力来帮助这群落难者了。","If they had been living in the time of genii, this incident would have given them the right to think that the island was haunted by some supernatural being, who used his power in the service of the castaways!"
"居民们划了几下桨，就到了慈悲河口。他们把小船拉到石窟旁边的海滩上，然后就朝花岗石宫的梯子走了过去。","A few strokes of the oar brought the settlers to the mouth of the Mercy.The canoe was hauled up on the beach near the Chimneys, and all proceeded towards the ladder of Granite House."
"但就在那时，托普愤怒地狂吠了起来，正四下寻找第一节梯子的纳布也喊了一声。","But at that moment, Top barked angrily, and Neb, who was looking for the first steps, uttered a cry."
"梯子不见了！","There was no longer a ladder!"
"第六章","Chapter 6"
"赛勒斯·哈丁一句话也不说，站在那里。他的同伴们在黑暗中摸索着石壁前行，梯子也许是被大风吹到了地上，想着它可能掉到地上。可是，它却消失了。至于说梯子是否被风暴卷到了半空中的平台，这在黑暗中还无从考证。","Cyrus Harding stood still, without saying a word.His companions searched in the darkness on the wall, in case the wind should have moved the ladder, and on the ground, thinking that it might have fallen down....But the ladder had quite disappeared.As to ascertaining if a squall had blown it on the landing-place, half way up, that was impossible in the dark."
"“就算是玩笑，”潘克洛夫喊道，“这玩笑开得也太没劲了！要回家还找不到爬上去的梯子，对我们这些疲惫的人来说，这玩笑开得也太大了。”","“If it is a joke,” cried Pencroft, “it is a very stupid one!To come home and find no staircase to go up to your room by—that’s nothing for weary men to laugh at.”"
"纳布只能狂喊：“天哪！天哪！天哪！”","Neb could do nothing but cry out “Oh! oh! oh!”"
"“我现在开始相信现林肯岛上是有怪事发生！”潘克洛夫说道。","“I begin to think that very curious things happen in Lincoln Island!” said Pencroft."
"“怪事？”吉丁·史佩莱接过话来说，“一点儿也不怪，潘克洛夫，这些再自然不过了。肯定有人趁我们不在的时候来过，他们不仅占了我们的窝，还把梯子收起来了。”","“Curious?” replied Gideon Spilett, “not at all, Pencroft, nothing can be more natural.Some one has come during our absence, taken possession of our dwelling and drawn up the ladder.”"
"“有人，”水手喊道，“是谁呢？”","“Some one,” cried the sailor.“But who?”"
"“除了那个开枪的猎人还会有谁？”记者接着说。","“Who but the hunter who fired the bullet?” replied the reporter."
"“哼，要是真有人在上面，”潘克洛夫说，他开始没有耐性了，“我跟他们打招呼，他们肯定会回答的。”","“Well, if there is any one up there,” replied Pencroft, who began to lose patience, “I will give them a hail, and they must answer.”"
"“喂！”水手拉长声音喊了喊，洪亮的回声在悬崖和岩石之间传来传去。","And in a stentorian voice the sailor gave a prolonged “Halloo!” which was echoed again and again from the cliff and rocks."
"居民们仔细听了听，总觉他们听到咯咯笑的声音，就是不知道是从哪里传来的。没有人回应潘克洛夫的叫喊，他又使劲地喊了好几嗓子，可是徒劳无果。","The settlers listened and they thought they heard a sort of chuckling laugh, of which they could not guess the origin.But no voice replied to Pencroft, who in vain repeated his vigorous shouts."
"这件事真是能使最冷漠的人都觉得惊讶，而这批居民并不是这样的人。在他们所处的这种环境下，每件事都有它的重要性，而且，呆在岛上的这七个月里，他们还没有遇到过这么奇怪的事，这点是毫无疑问的。","There was something indeed in this to astonish the most apathetic of men, and the settlers were not men of that description.In their situation every incident had its importance, and, certainly, during the seven months which they had spent on the island, they had not before met with anything of so surprising a character."
"尽管这件事的异常可能使他们都忘记了身体的疲惫，但他们还是只能呆在花岗石宫下面，不知道该怎样思考，不知道该做什么，相互问着，但是没有得到满意答案的希望，大家都开始胡乱猜想，而且一个比一个想得离奇。纳布感到悲伤，为自己不能进入厨房而非常沮丧，因为他们路上带的食物都吃完了，可他们却没法进行补充。","Be that as it may, forgetting their fatigue in the singularity of the event, they remained below Granite House, not knowing what to think, not knowing what to do, questioning each other without any hope of a satisfactory reply, every one starting some supposition each more unlikely than the last.Neb bewailed himself, much disappointed at not being able to get into his kitchen, for the provisions which they had had on their expedition were exhausted, and they had no means of renewing them."
"“朋友们，”赛勒斯·哈丁终于说道：“现在我们能做的只有一件事，那就是等到天亮，然后见机行事。不过我们要先去石窟那里。那里毕竟可以遮风挡雨，就算没有吃的，至少我们还能睡个觉。”","“My friends,” at last said Cyrus Harding, “there is only one thing to be done at present; wait for day, and then act according to circumstances.But let us go to the Chimneys.There we shall be under shelter, and if we cannot eat, we can at least sleep.”"
"“可到底是谁在跟我们玩这个残酷的把戏呢？”潘克洛夫又问起来了，他还不能下定决定离开这个地方。","“But who is it that has played us this cool trick?” again asked Pencroft, unable to make up his mind to retire from the spot."
"可不管是谁，唯一可行的方案就是遵照工程师的提议，去石窟那里等待天亮。这个时候，他们还命令托普在花岗石宫的窗户下面守着，托普一接到命令，就不发任何质疑地开始执行。因此，这只勇敢的狗在悬崖脚下留下来了，而它的主人则和同伴们在岩石中找了个栖息之所。","Whoever it was, the only thing practicable was to do as the engineer proposed, to go to the Chimneys and there wait for day.In the meanwhile Top was ordered to mount guard below the windows of Granite House, and when Top received an order he obeyed it without any questioning.The brave dog therefore remained at the foot of the cliff while his master with his companions sought a refuge among the rocks."
"居民们虽然很累，但要说他们在石窟的沙地上睡得好是不可能的。这不仅是因为他们急着要找出发生事情的原因，不管这些只是一场意外，等天一亮，他们或许能找到答案；还是相反，这些都是某个人所为，更糟糕的是，在这里睡觉非常舒服。但是，再怎么左思右想也都白搭，目前他们住的地方被占了，他们还没法进去。","To say that the settlers, notwithstanding their fatigue, slept well on the sandy floor of the Chimneys would not be true.It was not only that they were extremely anxious to find out the cause of what had happened, whether it was the result of an accident which would be discovered at the return of day, or whether on the contrary it was the work of a human being; but they also had very uncomfortable beds.That could not be helped, however, for in some way or other at that moment their dwelling was occupied, and they could not possibly enter it."
"花岗石宫不仅仅是他们住处，还是他们的仓库。那里存放了开拓者们所有的储物，像武器、设备、工具、火药和粮食等等。想到这些东西都可能被抢走，他们所有的工作都要重做一遍，还要制造新的武器和工具，这些都是严重的问题。他们内心非常不安，隔几分钟就有个人会去看一下托普是否在好好看着。赛勒斯·哈丁还像往常一样耐心地呆着，虽然他那坚强的意志在面对难以解释的事实时被激怒了，而且，他一让某种莫名的感觉影响了自己，心里就恼恨不已。吉丁·史佩莱也有同样的感受，他们两个人轻声谈论着难以解释的一切，再聪明、再有经验的他们这回也感到困惑了。","Now Granite House was more than their dwelling, it was their warehouse.There were all the stores belonging to the colony, weapons, instruments, tools, ammunition, provisions, etc.To think that all that might be pillaged and that the settlers would have all their work to do over again, fresh weapons and tools to make, was a serious matter.Their uneasiness led one or other of them also to go out every few minutes to see if Top was keeping good watch.Cyrus Harding alone waited with his habitual patience, although his strong mind was exasperated at being confronted with such an inexplicable fact, and he was provoked at himself for allowing a feeling to which he could not give a name, to gain an influence over him.Gideon Spilett shared his feelings in this respect, and the two conversed together in whispers of the inexplicable circumstance which baffled even their intelligence and experience."
"“这肯定是个玩笑，”潘克洛夫说，“肯定有人在背后开我们的玩笑。这样的玩笑我可不喜欢，开玩笑的那个人最好小心点，要是栽在我手里，就有他好看的！”","“It is a joke,” said Pencroft; “it is a trick some one has played us.Well, I don’t like such jokes, and the joker had better look out for himself, if he falls into my hands, I can tell him.”"
"一线曙光初现东方，拓荒者们就全副武装，回到花岗石宫下面的沙滩上。升起的太阳照在悬崖上，透过层层树叶，他们能窗户，百叶窗是关着的。","As soon as the first gleam of light appeared in the east, the colonists, suitably armed, repaired to the beach under Granite House.The rising sun now shone on the cliff and they could see the windows, the shutters of which were closed, through the curtains of foliage."
"一切看上去都很正常，不过，当拓荒者们看到临走时关好的门大开时，他们都失声大叫了起来。","All here was in order; but a cry escaped the colonists when they saw that the door, which they had closed on their departure, was now wide open."
"有人进入了花岗石宫，这已经是毋庸置疑的事实。","Some one had entered Granite House—there could be no more doubt about that."
"从门口挂到平台上的上半段梯子还在原地，可下半段梯子却被提到了与门口齐平的地方。很明显，入侵者想要这样保护自己，防止意外侵袭。","The upper ladder, which generally hung from the door to the landing, was in its place, but the lower ladder was drawn up and raised to the threshold.It was evident that the intruders had wished to guard themselves against a surprise."
"潘克洛夫又喊了一嗓子。","Pencroft hailed again."
"可是没有人回答。","No reply."
"“这帮混蛋，”水手喊到，“他们睡得还挺香，就像在自己家里一样。喂，你们这帮强盗、土匪、盗贼、‘约翰牛’养的！”","“The beggars,” exclaimed the sailor.“There they are sleeping quietly as if they were in their own house.Hallo there, you pirates, brigands, robbers, sons of John Bull!”"
"潘克洛夫是美国佬，他要是给某人冠以“约翰牛养的”的骂名，就算是把那人侮辱到极点了。","When Pencroft, being a Yankee, treated any one to the epithet of “son of John Bull,” he considered he had reached the last limits of insult."
"太阳已经完全升起来了，花岗石宫的整个外表也被光线照得很亮，可石宫的里面和外面一样，都是安静的。","The sun had now completely risen, and the whole facade of Granite House became illuminated by its rays; but in the interior as well as on the exterior all was quiet and calm."
"居民们都想知道花岗石宫里是否有人居住，而梯子的位置足以表明里面有人。另外可以肯定的是，不管那些人是谁，都不能逃出去。不过，怎么才能把他们抓住呢？","The settlers asked if Granite House was inhabited or not, and yet the position of the ladder was sufficient to show that it was; it was also certain that the inhabitants, whoever they might be, had not been able to escape.But how were they to be got at?"
"然后，赫伯特想到在箭上系个绳索，他可以将箭射到挂在门口梯子上的第一个空挡。他们可以通过绳索把梯子拉到地面上来，这样从沙滩到花岗石宫的通道就重新建立了。很明显，除此之外，他们没有别的办法，只需一点技术，这个方案就可能成功。幸运的是，石窟里留下了弓箭，他们还在那里找到了许多轻的木槿绳索。潘克洛夫把绳索系在扎好羽毛的箭上。接着，赫伯特把它固定在弓上，然后仔细瞄准了梯子的下半部分。","Herbert then thought of fastening a cord to an arrow, and shooting the arrow so that it should pass between the first rounds of the ladder which hung from the threshold.By means of the cord they would then be able to draw down the ladder to the ground, and so re-establish the communication between the beach and Granite House.There was evidently nothing else to be done, and, with a little skill, this method might succeed.Very fortunately bows and arrows had been left at the Chimneys, where they also found a quantity of light hibiscus cord.Pencroft fastened this to a well-feathered arrow.Then Herbert fixing it to his bow, took a careful aim for the lower part of the ladder."
"赛勒斯·哈丁、吉丁·史佩莱、潘克洛夫和纳布都往后退了几步，这样他们就能看到窗户那里的动静。记者用肩膀托起了枪支，并用枪口对准了门口。","Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Pencroft, and Neb drew back, so as to see if anything appeared at the windows.The reporter lifted his gun to his shoulder and covered the door."
"赫伯特一拉弓箭就射出去了，箭带着绳索穿过了梯子最后的两个空档。","The bow was bent, the arrow flew, taking the cord with it, and passed between the two last rounds."
"他成功了！","The operation had succeeded."
"赫伯特立马抓住了绳索的另一端，当他使劲想把梯子拉下来时，一只手臂突然从岩石和门之间伸出来，抓住绳索，拖进了花岗石宫里。","Herbert immediately seized the end of the cord, but, at that moment when he gave it a pull to bring down the ladder, an arm, thrust suddenly out between the wall and the door, grasped it and dragged it inside Granite House."
"“这帮混蛋！”水手喊道，“要是给你来一枪，你就别想活了。","“The rascals!” shouted the sailor.“If a ball can do anything for you, you shall not have long to wait for it."
"“那是谁呀？”纳布问道。","“But who was it?” asked Neb."
"“是谁？你没看到吗？”","“Who was it?Didn’t you see?”"
"“没有。”","“No.”"
"“那是一只猴子，一只卷尾猴，一只猩猩，一只狒狒，一只大猩猩，一只猿猴。我们的住所被一群猴子给攻占了，它们趁我们不在的时候，顺着梯子爬上去的。”","“It was a monkey, a sapajou, an orangoutang, a baboon, a gorilla, a sagoin.Our dwelling has been invaded by monkeys, who climbed up the ladder during our absence.”"
"这时，似乎为了证实水手的话，两三只灵长类动物出现在窗户旁，他们把百叶窗拉开，向这里真正的主人做起了无数个可恶的鬼脸。","And, at this moment, as if to bear witness to the truth of the sailor’s words, two or three quadrumana showed themselves at the windows, from which they had pushed back the shutters, and saluted the real proprietors of the place with a thousand hideous grimaces."
"“我就知道这只是个玩笑，”潘克洛夫喊道，“不过，它们这些开玩笑的总有一个要为其他的受罚！”","“I knew that it was only a joke,” cried Pencroft; “but one of the jokers shall pay the penalty for the rest.”"
"说罢，水手端起枪支迅速瞄准其中的一只猴子，并开了枪。所有的猴子都消失了，除了受到致命伤、倒在沙滩上的那只.这只体型庞大的猴子显然属于灵长类动物的第一类。不管它是一只黑猩猩，还是猩猩，或大猩猩，他们属于类人猿，这样叫它们是因为他们长得像人类。不过，赫伯特断定它是猩猩。","So saying, the sailor, raising his piece, took a rapid aim at one of the monkeys and fired.All disappeared, except one who fell mortally wounded on the beach.This monkey, which was of a large size, evidently belonged to the first order of the quadrumana.Whether this was a chimpanzee, an orangoutang, or a gorilla, he took rank among the anthropoid apes, who are so called from their resemblance to the human race.However, Herbert declared it to be an orangoutang."
"“多好的一只畜生啊！”纳布喊道。","“What a magnificent beast!” cried Neb."
"“你要说好那就是好吧！”潘克洛夫回答说，“可我还是没看出来我们怎么才能进屋！”","“Magnificent, if you like,” replied Pencroft; “but still I do not see how we are to get into our house.”"
"“赫伯特是超级棒的神射手，”记者说道，“他的弓就在这儿。他可以再试一次。”","“Herbert is a good marksman,” said the reporter, “and his bow is here.He can try again.”"
"“什么！这些猴子狡猾得很，”潘克洛夫说，“他们再也不会出现在窗户那里，所以我们也射不着它们，可我一想到它们可能在房间和仓库做的坏事，我就——”","“Why, these apes are so cunning,” returned Pencroft; “they won’t show themselves again at the windows and so we can’t kill them; and when I think of the mischief they may do in the rooms and storehouse—”"
"“别着急，”哈丁回答说，“这些动物不能让我们一直在海湾上。”","“Have patience,” replied Harding; “these creatures cannot keep us long at bay.”"
"“直到我看到它们下到这里，否则可不敢确信，”水手说道，“上尉，你现在能知道上面有几十个吗？”","“I shall not be sure of that till I see them down here,” replied the sailor.“And now, captain, do you know how many dozens of these fellows are up there?”"
"潘克洛夫这个问题很难回答，而且要让少年再试一次已经不是一件轻而易举的事了。因为梯子的下半部分又被拉到了门里，如果再射一箭，绳子会断，而梯子还是稳当地在原地。事情着实很复杂。潘克洛夫在一旁急得暴跳如雷。目前的形势还真有点滑稽，可他一点儿也不觉得好笑。居民们肯定能将入侵者赶出去，重夺家园，可到底是什么时候？他们又该怎么做？这还都是他们不知道的问题。","It was difficult to reply to Pencroft, and as for the young boy making another attempt, that was not easy; for the lower part of the ladder had been drawn again into the door, and when another pull was given, the line broke and the ladder remained firm.The case was really perplexing.Pencroft stormed.There was a comic side to the situation, but he did not think it funny at all.It was certain that the settlers would end by reinstating themselves in their domicile and driving out the intruders, but when and how? this is what they were not able to say."
"两个小时过去了，这些猿猴很小心地不露面，可是它们还在那里，有三四次门缝里或窗户边都会探出一个鼻子或一只爪，不过立即就会被射上一枪。","Two hours passed, during which the apes took care not to show themselves, but they were still there, and three or four times a nose or a paw was poked out at the door or windows, and was immediately saluted by a gun-shot."
"“我们藏起来吧。”工程师最后说，“兴许这些猿猴会以为我们安静地走了，那样它们可能会再次现身。史佩莱和赫伯特躲在岩石后面，对准它们可能出现的地方开火。”","“Let us hide ourselves,” at last said the engineer.“Perhaps the apes will think we have gone quite away and will show themselves again.Let Spilett and Herbert conceal themselves behind those rocks and fire on all that may appear.”"
"大伙都遵照工程师的建议，记者和少年堪称这个开拓地最棒的神射手，他们站在很好的位置上，但不在猴子的视线内。而纳布、潘克洛夫和赛勒斯·哈则爬上高地进入了森林里，他们想捕点猎物，现在是吃点早餐的时间了，可是却没有食物剩下了。","The engineer’s orders were obeyed, and while the reporter and the lad, the best marksmen in the colony, posted themselves in a good position, but out of the monkeys’ sight, Neb, Pencroft, and Cyrus climbed the plateau and entered the forest in order to kill some game, for it was now time for breakfast and they had no provisions remaining."
"半小时后，猎人们带回了几只野鸽，他们尽可能地把鸽子烤得好吃一点。还没有出现一只猿猴。吉丁·史佩莱和赫伯特去拿自己的早餐，只留下托普在窗户下面看着。吃完东西后，他们又回到了自己的位置。","In half an hour the hunters returned with a few rock pigeons, which they roasted as well as they could.Not an ape had appeared.Gideon Spilett and Herbert went to take their share of the breakfast, leaving Top to watch under the windows.They then, having eaten, returned to their post."
"两小时过去了，可是情况没有任何进展。这些猴子没有任何现身的迹象，它们也不大可能已经离开，但可能性更大的是，它们被同伴的死和枪声吓到了，所以退到屋子的最里面，甚至是仓库里。当他们一想到仓库里放着的那些珍贵东西，工程师反复念叨的耐心迅速变为极度的恼怒，不过这当然是有原因的。","Two hours later, their situation was in no degree improved.The quadrumana gave no sign of existence, and it might have been supposed that they had disappeared; but what seemed more probable was that, terrified by the death of one of their companions, and frightened by the noise of the firearms, they had retreated to the back part of the house or probably even into the store-room.And when they thought of the valuables which this storeroom contained, the patience so much recommended by the engineer, fast changed into great irritation, and there certainly was room for it."
"“形势明显不利，”记者说，“可最糟糕的是，还没有结束这种局面的办法。”","“Decidedly it is too bad,” said the reporter; “and the worst of it is, there is no way of putting an end to it.”"
"“不管怎样，我们都得把这帮混账东西赶出去，”水手喊道，“就算有二十多个恶棍，我们也能很快打败它们，只不过，我们必须与它们进行肉搏了。来吧，没法制服它们吗？”","“But we must drive these vagabonds out somehow,” cried the sailor.“We could soon get the better of them, even if there are twenty of the rascals; but for that, we must meet them hand to hand.Come now, is there no way of getting at them?”"
"“我们试着从原来湖边的入口进入花岗石宫吧。”工程师回答说。","“Let us try to enter Granite House by the old opening at the lake,” replied the engineer."
"“噢！”水手大叫起来，“我怎么没有想到。”","“Oh!” shouted the sailor, “and I never thought of that.”"
"事实上，这是他们进入花岗石宫、与入侵者搏斗并把它们赶出去的唯一办法。事实上，入口已经被他们用水泥粘住的石头墙给封住了，现在必须牺牲它，但这很容易重建。幸好，赛勒斯·哈丁还没有实施自己的计划，提升湖面，掩盖入口，因为这个工程要花些时间来做。","This was in reality the only way by which to penetrate into Granite House so as to fight with and drive out the intruders.The opening was, it is true, closed up with a wall of cemented stones, which it would be necessary to sacrifice, but that could easily be rebuilt.Fortunately, Cyrus Harding had not as yet effected his project of hiding this opening by raising the waters of the lake, for the operation would then have taken some time."
"现在已经过了十二点，开拓者们全副武装，带上锄头和铲子离开了石窟。吩咐完托普呆在原地后，他们就从花岗石宫的窗户下面过去了，开始爬上慈悲河的左岸，这样他们就能到达眺望岗。","It was already past twelve o’clock, when the colonists, well armed and provided with picks and spades, left the Chimneys, passed beneath the windows of Granite House, after telling Top to remain at his post, and began to ascend the left bank of the Mercy, so as to reach Prospect Heights."
"可走了不到50步，他们就听到狗在狂叫。","But they had not made fifty steps in this direction, when they heard the dog barking furiously."
"他们又全部沿着河岸冲下去。","And all rushed down the bank again."
"一到拐弯处，他们就发现情况有所变化。","Arrived at the turning, they saw that the situation had changed."
"实际上，这些猿猴不知为何，突然被吓得四处逃窜。有两三只猴子连跑带爬地从一个窗户到了另一个窗户，行动敏捷得像杂技演员。它们也没有想办法把梯子拉回来，这样是很容易下来的，或许是太害怕了，它们都忘了这种逃跑的方法。开拓者们现在毫不费力就瞄准它们，开了枪。有几只猴子死了，有的受伤了就跑回了屋子里，发出尖叫的叫声。剩下那些往外跑的猴子摔在地上粉身碎骨了，不到几分钟，目前他们知道花岗石宫没有活着的猴子了。","In fact, the apes, seized with a sudden panic, from some unknown cause, were trying to escape.Two or three ran and clambered from one window to another with the agility of acrobats.They were not even trying to replace the ladder, by which it would have been easy to descend; perhaps in their terror they had forgotten this way of escape.The colonists, now being able to take aim without difficulty, fired.Some, wounded or killed, fell back into the rooms, uttering piercing cries.The rest, throwing themselves out, were dashed to pieces in their fall, and in a few minutes, so far as they knew, there was not a living quadrumana in Granite House."
"这时，他们看见梯子从门口滑落下来，展开并摔在了地上。","At this moment the ladder was seen to slip over the threshold, then unroll and fall to the ground."
"“哈哈！”水手喊道，“这就奇怪了！”","“Hullo!” cried the sailor, “this is queer!”"
"“非常奇怪！”工程师低语道，这时他已经率先爬到了梯子上。","“Very strange!” murmured the engineer, leaping first up the ladder."
"“小心点，上尉！”潘克洛夫喊道，“说不定那里还有些恶棍。”","“Take care, captain!” cried Pencroft, “perhaps there are still some of these rascals."
"“我们马上就能看到了。”工程师回答说，不过他并没有停下来。","“We shall soon see,” replied the engineer, without stopping however."
"同伴们都跟着他，一分钟后他们就到了门口。他们到处搜寻。房间里一只猴子也没有，仓库也是，这一帮猴子曾经非常青睐这里。","All his companions followed him, and in a minute they had arrived at the threshold.They searched everywhere.There was no one in the rooms nor in the storehouse, which had been respected by the band of quadrumana."
"“现在，这梯子，”水手喊道，“哪位绅士帮我们把梯子弄下来？”","“Well now, and the ladder,” cried the sailor; “who can the gentleman have been who sent us that down?”"
"这时，他们听见了一声大叫，一只藏在通道里的大猩猩冲到屋子里来了，纳布在后面追着它。","But at that moment a cry was heard, and a great orang, who had hidden himself in the passage, rushed into the room, pursued by Neb."
"“啊，强盗！”潘克洛夫喊道。","“Ah, the robber!” cried Pencroft."
"他手上拿着斧子，准备把那只畜生的脑袋砍下来，这时，赛勒斯·哈丁抓住了他的手，说道：","And hatchet in hand, he was about to cleave the head of the animal, when Cyrus Harding seized his arm, saying,—"
"“放了它吧，潘克洛夫。”","“Spare him, Pencroft.”"
"“放了这个无赖？”","“Pardon this rascal?”"
"“对，是它把梯子扔给我们的！”","“Yes! it was he who threw us the ladder!”"
"工程师说这话时语气很奇怪，大家很难知道他是否是认真说的。","And the engineer said this in such a peculiar voice that it was difficult to know whether he spoke seriously or not."
"不过，他们还是扑到了大猩猩身上，它奋力反抗，但很快就没有力气，最后被绑住了。","Nevertheless, they threw themselves on the orang, who defended himself gallantly, but was soon overpowered and bound."
"“好了！”潘克洛夫说，“现在我们已经抓住它了，该拿它怎么办？”","“There!” said Pencroft.“And what shall we make of him, now we’ve got him?”"
"“当仆人！”赫伯特回答说。","“A servant!” replied Herbert."
"这个孩子说这话可不带半点开玩笑，因为他知道可以利用这个聪明的族类。","The lad was not joking in saying this, for he knew how this intelligent race could be turned to account."
"居民们走近这只猿猴，仔细地打量着它。它属于类人猿，这种猿猴的颜面角并不比澳大利亚人和霍屯督人次很多。它是一只猩猩，既不像大猩猩那样凶猛，又没有狒狒那样迟钝。有许多特征可以证明，这种类人猿几乎具备了和人类一样的智慧。要是雇用到家里，它们会在桌旁伺候着、打扫房间、刷鞋，还能正确使用刀叉和汤勺，甚至会喝酒，和靠两条腿走路的、最好的仆人相比，它们能把每件事都做得和他们一样好。布丰就有一只这样的猿猴，它忠诚、热心地伺候了主人很长一段时间。","The settlers then approached the ape and gazed at it attentively.He belonged to the family of anthropoid apes, of which the facial angle is not much inferior to that of the Australians and Hottentots.It was an orangoutang, and as such, had neither the ferocity of the gorilla, nor the stupidity of the baboon.It is to this family of the anthropoid apes that so many characteristics belong which prove them to be possessed of an almost human intelligence.Employed in houses, they can wait at table, sweep rooms, brush clothes, clean boots, handle a knife, fork, and spoon properly, and even drink wine...doing everything as well as the best servant that ever walked upon two legs.Buffon possessed one of these apes, who served him for a long time as a faithful and zealous servant."
"他们在花岗石宫抓住的这只猿猴是个体型庞大的家伙，身高六英尺，身材匀称得让人羡慕，胸脯宽阔，脑袋大小合适，颜面角达65度，头颅浑圆，鼻子突出，全身长满一层柔软而光滑的毛，总之，它是类人猿中的上等品种。它的眼睛虽然比人类的要小，但闪耀着智慧的光辉。它那雪白的牙齿在胡髭下闪闪发光，下巴上还长了点卷卷的棕色小胡须。","The one which had been seized in the hall of Granite House was a great fellow, six feet high, with an admirably poportioned frame, a broad chest, head of a moderate size, the facial angle reaching sixty-five degrees, round skull, projecting nose, skin covered with soft glossy hair, in short, a fine specimen of the anthropoids.His eyes, rather smaller than human eyes, sparkled with intelligence; his white teeth glittered under his mustache, and he wore a little curly brown beard."
"“好标致的家伙！”潘克洛夫说道，“要是我们能听懂它的语言，就能和它交流了。”","“A handsome fellow!” said Pencroft; “if we only knew his language, we could talk to him.”"
"“可是，主人，”纳布说，“你是认真的吗？我们真的要收它作仆人吗？”","“But, master,” said Neb, “are you serious?Are we going to take him as a servant?”"
"“是啊，纳布，”工程师笑着回答说，“但你可不许嫉妒哦。”","“Yes, Neb,” replied the engineer, smiling.“But you must not be jealous.”"
"“我希望它能当一个出色的仆人，”赫伯特又说道，“它看上去很年轻，肯定很容易训练，而且，我们不能用武力使它服从，也不能像别人一样拔掉它的牙齿。如果主人对它好，它很快就会喜欢上主人的。”","“And I hope he will make an excellent servant,” added Herbert.“He appears young, and will be easy to educate, and we shall not be obliged to use force to subdue him, nor draw his teeth, as is sometimes done.He will soon grow fond of his masters if they are kind to him.”"
"“他们会的。”潘克洛夫回答说，这时他已经忘记了对“开玩笑者”的仇恨。","“And they will be,” replied Pencroft, who had forgotten all his rancor against “the jokers.”"
"然后，他靠近这只猩猩，说道：","Then, approaching the orang,—"
"“嘿，老家伙！”他问道，“你好吗？”","“Well, old boy!” he asked, “how are you?”"
"猩猩发出了点哼哼的声音，不过没有显出生气之意。","The orang replied by a little grunt which did not show any anger."
"“你愿意加入我们这些开拓者吗？”水手问道，“你当赛勒斯·哈丁上尉的仆人怎么样？”","“You wish to join the colony?” again asked the sailor.“You are going to enter the service of Captain Cyrus Harding?”"
"猩猩又发出了哼哼声回应。","Another respondent grunt was uttered by the ape."
"“你的回报只有食物没有薪水，你满意吧？”","“And you will be satisfied with no other wages than your food?”"
"它第三次发出哼哼声。","Third affirmative grunt."
"“这个谈话似乎有点无趣啊！”吉丁·史佩莱说。","“This conversation is slightly monotonous,” observed Gideon Spilett."
"“这样最好，”潘克洛夫回答说，“最好的仆人就是说话最少的。没有工资，听见了吗，伙计？刚开始我们不会给你任何报酬，不过要是以后我们对你满意，就会让你的报酬加倍。”","“So much the better,” replied Pencroft; “the best servants are those who talk the least.And then, no wages, do you hear, my boy?We will give you no wages at first, but we will double them afterwards if we are pleased with you.”"
"这样，开拓地又增添了一位新成员。至于它的名字，为了纪念他曾经认识的一只猿猴，他请求给它取名叫丘辟特，简称贾普。","Thus the colony was increased by a new member.As to his name the sailor begged that in memory of another ape which he had known, he might be called Jupiter, and Jup for short."
"这样，在没有任何仪式的情况下，主人贾普在花岗石宫住下了。","And so, without more ceremony, Master Jup was installed in Granite House."
"第七章","Chapter 7"
"这些林肯岛上的居民重新夺回了他们的住所，而且他们也不用从原来的入口进去，所以也就省去了泥匠的工作。他们确实很幸运，正当他们要推翻石头墙的时候，猿猴被某种恐惧吓得逃出了花岗石宫，这既突然又不可理解。难道这群动物发现了自己会受到来自另一个方向的攻击吗？这就是它们突然逃离的唯一解释。","The settlers in Lincoln Island had now regained their dwelling, without having been obliged to reach it by the old opening, and were therefore spared the trouble of mason’s work.It was certainly lucky, that at the moment they were about to set out to do so, the apes had been seized with that terror, no less sudden than inexplicable, which had driven them out of Granite House.Had the animals discovered that they were about to be attacked from another direction?This was the only explanation of their sudden retreat."
"白天的时候，他们把死猿猴的尸体搬到树林里埋了，接着他们就开始收拾这些入侵者造成的混乱，但没有什么破坏，虽然这些猴子把屋子弄得乱七八糟，但它们没有破坏什么东西。纳布重新点燃了炉子，食品室里的储备还能做一顿大餐，大家都饱饱地吃了一顿。","During the day the bodies of the apes were carried into the wood, where they were buried; then the settlers busied themselves in repairing the disorder caused by the intruders, disorder but not damage, for although they had turned everything in the rooms topsy-turvy, yet they had broken nothing.Neb relighted his stove, and the stores in the larder furnished a substantial repast, to which all did ample justice."
"大家没忘了贾普，他们给它提供了很多南欧松子和根茎，贾普津津有味地吃起来了。潘克洛夫把他的前肢松开了，不过他觉得在更确信贾普服从之前，最好把它的后肢绑住。","Jup was not forgotten, and he ate with relish some stonepine almonds and rhizome roots, with which he was abundantly supplied.Pencroft had unfastened his arms, but judged it best to have his legs tied until they were more sure of his submission."
"在回去休息之前，哈丁和他的同伴们围坐在桌子旁边，讨论那些计划，执行这些计划十分紧迫。现在最重要而且最紧迫的事就是在慈悲河上架一座桥，以建立岛屿南部和花岗石宫的交通，再就是建一个围栏，圈养他们打算捕获的摩弗伦羊和其他多毛的羊。","Then, before retiring to rest, Harding and his companions seated round their table, discussed those plans, the execution of which was most pressing.The most important and most urgent was the establishment of a bridge over the Mercy, so as to form a communication with the southern part of the island and Granite House; then the making of an enclosure for the musmons or other woolly animals which they wished to capture."
"这两个工程可以解决他们的衣服问题，这是目前非常重要的事情。桥梁能使他们轻松运回气球套，那样他们就能够得到亚麻布，而围栏里的牲畜可以产羊毛，他们就有冬衣穿了。","These two projects would help to solve the difficulty as to their clothing, which was now serious.The bridge would render easy the transport of the balloon case, which would furnish them with linen, and the inhabitants of the enclosure would yield wool which would supply them with winter clothes."
"赛勒斯·哈丁提议把围栏设在红河的发源地，在那里，反刍动物可以吃到新鲜而充足的牧草。从眺望岗到红河源头的路有一部分已经开辟了，而且，要是他们能有到比先前那辆更好的车，尤其是他们若能抓到拉车的动物，材料就能很容易地运到这里。","As to the enclosure, it was Cyrus Harding’s intention to establish it at the sources of the Red Creek, where the ruminants would find fresh and abundant pasture.The road between Prospect Heights and the sources of the stream was already partly beaten, and with a better cart than the first, the material could be easily conveyed to the spot, especially if they could manage to capture some animals to draw it."
"围栏离花岗石宫很远，虽然可能并没有什么不便，可家禽场就不一样了，纳布提醒拓荒者们注意这一点。确实，鸟类应该在厨师触手可及的地方，要建所谓的家禽场，再也没有比靠近原来入口的河岸更合适的地方了。","But though there might be no inconvenience in the enclosure being so far from Granite House, it would not be the same with the poultry-yard, to which Neb called the attention of the colonists.It was indeed necessary that the birds should be close within reach of the cook, and no place appeared more favorable for the establishment of the said poultry-yard than that portion of the banks of the lake which was close to the old opening."
"水鸟以及其他的鸟类都可以在那里繁育，他们上次捕猎途中捉到的一对鹌鹑是第一批被驯养的。","Water-birds would prosper there as well as others, and the couple of tinamous taken in their last excursion would be the first to be domesticated."
"第二天是11月3号，他们开始了新工作——建桥，这项重大工程需要每个人都参与。居民们肩上扛着锯子、斧头和锤子，现在又变成了木匠，下行到海岸边。","The next day, the 3rd of November, the new works were begun by the construction of the bridge, and all hands were required for this important task.Saws, hatchets, and hammers were shouldered by the settlers, who, now transformed into carpenters, descended to the shore."
"这时，潘克洛夫说道：","There Pencroft observed,—"
"“昨天贾普礼貌地把梯子还给了我们，可要是我们不在的时候，它动歪脑筋把梯子拿走了怎么办？”","“Suppose, that during our absence, Master Jup takes it into his head to draw up the ladder which he so politely returned to us yesterday?”"
"“那我们就把梯子的下端往下拉点，并固定住。”赛勒斯·哈丁回答说。","“Let us tie its lower end down firmly,” replied Cyrus Harding."
"他们把两根桩子固定在了沙子里，这样就把梯子绑住了。接着，居民就上了慈悲河的左岸，很快他们就到了河流的拐角处。","This was done by means of two stakes securely fixed in the sand.Then the settlers, ascending the left bank of the Mercy, soon arrived at the angle formed by the river."
"他们在那里停下来，想确定是否能从这里把桥搭到对面去。这个地点看起来很合适。","There they halted, in order to ascertain if the bridge could be thrown across.The place appeared suitable."
"事实上，他们这里离前天在南岸发现的气球港只有3.5英尺，而且，在桥和气球港之间修一条大车能通行的道路也很容易，这样，花岗石宫和岛屿南部的交通就能变得很便捷了。","In fact, from this spot, to Port Balloon, discovered the day before on the southern coast, there was only a distance of three miles and a half, and from the bridge to the Port, it would be easy to make a good cart-road which would render the communication between Granite House and the south of the island extremely easy."
"赛勒斯·哈丁给大伙说了个方案，就是说把眺望岗完全孤立起来，这样它也就能远离四足兽和灵长类动物的进攻。如此一来，花岗石宫、石窟、家禽场以及用来耕种的整个高地上部都能免受动物的掠夺。再也没有比执行这个工程更简单的了，这也是工程师打算做的事情。","Cyrus Harding now imparted to his companions a scheme for completely isolating Prospect Heights so as to shelter it from the attacks both of quadrupeds and quadrumana.In this way, Granite House, the Chimneys, the poultry-yard, and all the upper part of the plateau which was to be used for cultivation, would be protected against the depredations of animals.Nothing could be easier than to execute this project, and this is how the engineer intended to set to work."
"高地三面已经被水道防卫起来，有的是人工挖的，有的是天然产生的。在西北部的格兰特湖岸，从通道的入口处延伸至湖岸的裂口，是为了河水泻出的。","The plateau was already defended on three sides by water-courses, either artificial or natural.On the northwest, by the shores of Lake Grant, from the entrance of the passage to the breach made in the banks of the lake for the escape of the water."
"北部的出水口至海边形成了一条新的水道，这条水道经过高地和海岸，然后在瀑布的上下两端冲刷出了河床，只要把河床挖深，就足以使动物无法进入。而在全部的东部边界上，从上面提过的河流河口到慈悲河口旁都是海洋。","On the north, from this breach to the sea, by the new water-course which had hollowed out a bed for itself across the plateau and shore, above and below the fall, and it would be enough to dig the bed of this creek a little deeper to make it impracticable for animals, on all the eastern border by the sea itself, from the mouth of the aforesaid creek to the mouth of the Mercy."
"最后在南边，从河口到慈悲河的拐角处就是将要架桥的地方。","Lastly, on the south, from the mouth to the turn of the Mercy where the bridge was to be established."
"高地的西部边界现在仍在河流拐角和湖的南角，这段距离长约一英里，是完全开放的地方。可是，再也没有比挖一条又宽又深的水渠更简单的事了，水渠可以从河流引水，水满了就可以形成湍急的瀑布，落入慈悲河的河床。毫无疑问，湖水水位会因为新排出的水而降低一些，不过，赛勒斯·哈丁确信，红河巨大的水量足够保证执行这项工程。","The western border of the plateau now remained between the turn of the river and the southern angle of the lake, a distance of about a mile, which was open to all comers.But nothing could be easier than to dig a broad deep ditch, which could be filled from the lake, and the overflow of which would throw itself by a rapid fall into the bed of the Mercy.The level of the lake would, no doubt, be somewhat lowered by this fresh discharge of its waters, but Cyrus Harding had ascertained that the volume of water in the Red Creek was considerable enough to allow of the execution of this project."
"“这样的话，”工程师补充道，“眺望岗就会成为四面环水的普通小岛，从眺望岗去岛上的其他地方，就只能经过我们要架在慈悲河上的新桥，还有瀑布上下两端的旧桥。最后，我们还要造两座小桥，一座架在我建议开挖的运河上，另一座通往慈悲河的左岸。如果这些桥都能如愿架好的，眺望岗就不会受到任何突袭了。”","“So then,” added the engineer, “Prospect Heights will become a regular island, being surrounded with water on all sides, and only communicating with the rest of our domain by the bridge which we are about to throw across the Mercy, the two little bridges already established above and below the fall; and, lastly, two other little bridges which must be constructed, one over the canal which I propose to dig, the other across to the left bank of the Mercy.Now, if these bridges can be raised at will, Prospect Heights will be guarded from any surprise.”"
"架桥成为最紧迫的事务了。他们选好树砍了下来，把树枝去掉，然后就把树干裁成了桥梁、托架和厚板。慈悲河右岸的桥端必须牢固，不过左岸的桥端可以是活动的，这样桥梁就可以像有些运河桥一样通过均衡锤提起来。","The bridge was the most urgent work.Trees were selected, cut down, stripped of their branches, and cut into beams, joists, and planks.The end of the bridge which rested on the right bank of the Mercy was to be firm, but the other end on the left bank was to be movable, so that it might be raised by means of a counterpoise, as some canal bridges are managed."
"这工作无疑是相当艰巨的，虽然得到很有技巧的指导，但这工作要费点时间，因为慈悲河在这里的宽度达80英尺。因此，他们有必要在河床上打好桥桩，以支撑桥板，他们还得安一个打桩机在桥桩顶上。另外，桥桩需要形成拱门，使桥梁承受很大的重量。","This was certainly a considerable work, and though it was skillfully conducted, it took some time, for the Mercy at this place was eighty feet wide.It was therefore necessary to fix piles in the bed of the river so as to sustain the floor of the bridge and establish a pile-driver to act on the tops of these piles, which would thus form two arches and allow the bridge to support heavy loads."
"幸运的是，他们不缺少木材用具，也不缺少用来固定木头的铁制工具，更不缺少聪明智慧、造桥知识非凡的人，最后他们也不缺热情高昂的同伴，在过去的七个月里，他们已经学会了使用这些工具的精湛技巧。还有必须要提到的是技术熟练的吉丁·史佩莱，他灵巧的手艺和水手几乎不分伯仲。“谁会想到一个记者会干这么多事！”潘克洛夫想。","Happily there was no want of tools with which to shape the wood, nor of iron-work to make it firm, nor of the ingenuity of a man who had a marvelous knowledge of the work, nor lastly, the zeal of his companions, who in seven months had necessarily acquired great skill in the use of their tools; and it must be said that not the least skilful was Gideon Spilett, who in dexterity almost equaled the sailor himself.“Who would ever have expected so much from a newspaper man!” thought Pencroft."
"慈悲桥的建造持续了三个星期，他们每天辛辛苦苦地工作。他们甚至连早饭都是在干活的工地吃的，由于天气很好，他们只有睡觉的时候才回到花岗石宫。","The construction of the Mercy bridge lasted three weeks of regular hard work.They even breakfasted on the scene of their labors, and the weather being magnificent, they only returned to Granite House to sleep."
"在这段时间，可以说贾普越来越习惯他的新主人了，他总是用好奇的眼神看着他们的举动。但是，作为预防措施，潘克洛夫还是没有给它完全的自由，他想等到高地的定界工程完成以后再说，这种考虑是很恰当的。托普和贾普喜欢在一起玩耍，他们成了好朋友，但是贾普做每件事都很严肃。","During this period it may be stated that Master Jup grew more accustomed to his new masters, whose movements he always watched with very inquisitive eyes.However, as a precautionary measure, Pencroft did not as yet allow him complete liberty, rightly wishing to wait until the limits of the plateau should be settled by the projected works.Top and Jup were good friends and played willingly together, but Jup did everything solemnly."
"11月20号，桥梁终于竣工了。通过均衡锤的作用，桥梁的活动部分很容易就能挂起来，而且只需一点儿力气就能把它吊起来。用以支撑桥梁下降的最后一根横木以及桥梁的枢纽之间，存在20英尺宽的缝隙，它足以阻挡任何动物爬上来。","On the 20th of November the bridge was finished.The movable part, balanced by the counterpoise, swung easily, and only a slight effort was needed to rise it; between its hinge and the last cross-bar on which it rested when closed, there existed a space of twenty feet, which was sufficiently wide to prevent any animals from crossing."
"这些岛上的居民开始考虑把气球取回来，他们都特别想把气球放到万分安全的地方。不过要拿回来，他们必须先弄辆推车到气球港，于是他们还得在远西森林茂密的树丛中开辟出一条道路。要完成这些任务需要花一定的时间。另外，纳布和潘克洛夫在气球港查看完情况后说，放在洞穴里的布不会受到损坏，于是大家决定继续进行眺望岗的工程。","The settlers now began to talk of fetching the balloon-case, which they were anxious to place in perfect security; but to bring it, it would be necessary to take a cart to Port Balloon, and consequently, necessary to beat a road through the dense forests of the Far West.This would take some time.Also, Neb and Pencroft having gone to examine into the state of things at Port Balloon, and reported that the stock of cloth would suffer no damage in the grotto where it was stored, it was decided that the work at Prospect Heights should not be discontinued."
"“这样的话，”潘克洛夫说道，“我们就能把家禽场建得更好了，因为我们不用担心会有狐狸的造访，或是其他野兽的攻击了。”","“That,” observed Pencroft, “will enable us to establish our poultry-yard under better conditions, since we need have no fear of visits from foxes nor the attacks of other beasts.”"
"“那么，”纳布补充道，“我们可以清理一下高地，然后把野生植物移植到那里。”","“Then,” added Neb, “we can clear the plateau, and transplant wild plants to it.”"
"“还能准备我们的第二块麦田！”水手带着胜利者的姿态喊起来了。","“And prepare our second corn-field!” cried the sailor with a triumphant air."
"确实，多亏了潘克洛夫的照料，只种了一颗谷粒的第一块麦地生长得极好。正如工程师预言的，这颗麦粒长出了十个穗子，每个穗子又结出了80颗麦玉米粒，六个月的时间里，他们就得到了800颗麦粒，这样他们每年都能有两次大丰收了。","In fact, the first corn-field sown with a single grain had prospered admirably, thanks to Pencroft’s care.It had produced the ten ears foretold by the engineer, and each ear containing eighty grains, the colony found itself in possession of eight hundred grains, in six months, which promised a double harvest each year."
"这800颗麦粒除了要留出50颗细心保留外，其他的都要种到新开辟的土地上，而且，它们会像第一颗庄稼那样得到十分细致的培育。","These eight hundred grains, except fifty, which were prudently reserved, were to be sown in a new field, but with no less care than was bestowed on the single grain."
"新的土地准备好了，接着他们就在旁边立了一圈结实的栅栏，栅栏很高，而且顶部也削尖了，这样四足动物就没那么容易跳进来了。至于如何对付那些飞鸟，潘克洛夫那机灵的大脑想出扎一些稻草人，就足以把它们吓走。剩下的750颗麦粒都整齐地种在了田垄里，剩下的就要交给大自然了。","The field was prepared, then surrounded with a strong palisade, high and pointed, which quadrupeds would have found difficulty in leaping.As to birds, some scarecrows, due to Pencroft’s ingenious brain, were enough to frighten them.The seven hundred and fifty grains deposited in very regular furrows were then left for nature to do the rest."
"11月21号这天，赛勒斯·哈丁开始规划建设运河，运河从格兰特湖的南角延伸至慈悲河的拐角处，从而将西边的高地与其他地方隔离开来。这里的土壤有两三英尺都是腐殖土，再下面就是花岗岩。所以，他们需要再造一些硝化甘油，用来做它惯常的工作。不到两个星期，他们就在高地坚硬的地面中挖出了一条深6英尺、宽12英尺的沟渠。他们还用同样的方法在湖的岩石边缘挖出了另外一条沟渠，形成了一条小溪，他们给它取名叫甘油河，因此成为慈悲河的支流。正如工程师所预料的那样，湖水的水位下降了，虽然下降得非常少。为了完成将高地全部围住的工程，他们将海滩上的河床大大拓宽了，还用木桩固定住沙子。","On the 21st of November, Cyrus Harding began to plan the canal which was to close the plateau on the west, from the south angle of Lake Grant to the angle of the Mercy.There was there two or three feet of vegetable earth, and below that granite.It was therefore necessary to manufacture some more nitro-glycerine, and the nitro-glycerine did its accustomed work.In less than a fortnight a ditch, twelve feet wide and six deep, was dug out in the hard ground of the plateau.A new trench was made by the same means in the rocky border of the lake, forming a small stream, to which they gave the name of Creek Glycerine, and which was thus an affluent of the Mercy.As the engineer had predicted, the level of the lake was lowered, though very slightly.To complete the enclosure the bed of the stream on the beach was considerably enlarged, and the sand supported by means of stakes."
"到12月中旬，他们就干完了这些活，眺望岗这个不规则的五边形，有长达近四英里的边界线，如今已被河流地带包围了，如此一来，不管什么样的盗贼都完全侵袭不了这里。","By the end of the first fortnight of December these works were finished, and Prospect Heights—that is to say, a sort of irregular pentagon, having a perimeter of nearly four miles, surrounded by a liquid belt—was completely protected from depredators of every description."
"十二月的时候，天气非常炎热。即使这样，居民们仍然继续干活，由于想拥有一个家禽场，他们立马就开始动手。","During the month of December, the heat was very great.In spite of it, however, the settlers continued their work, and as they were anxious to possess a poultry-yard they forthwith commenced it."
"自不用说，高地的围栏工程完成以后，贾普就自由了。他并没有离开他的主人，而且没有表示逃跑的意思。虽然它劲儿很大，也非常活跃，但是它是个温和的动物。大家已经教会他变成有价值的一员，它会拉木头，以及运送从甘油河河床里刨出来的石头。","It is useless to say that since the enclosing of the plateau had been completed, Master Jup had been set at liberty.He did not leave his masters, and evinced no wish to escape.He was a gentle animal, though very powerful and wonderfully active.He was already taught to make himself useful by drawing loads of wood and carting away the stones which were extracted from the bed of Creek Glycerine."
"家禽场位于湖泊东南岸，占地200平方码。场地周围都是栅栏，里面为了繁殖鸟类，搭建了各种各样的棚子。这些棚用树枝简单搭成，而且被隔成了许多小单间，供要到来的客人居住。","The poultry-yard occupied an area of two hundred square yards, on the southeastern bank of the lake.It was surrounded by a palisade, and in it were constructed various shelters for the birds which were to populate it.These were simply built of branches and divided into compartments, made ready for the expected guests."
"最早来这里的是两只鹌鹑，它们不久就有了许多小鹌鹑，和它们一起住的还有六只鸭子，它们更习惯呆在湖边。其中有几只是中国种类的鸭，它们的翅膀张开时像扇子，羽毛绚丽多彩，可以与金鸡相媲美。几天后，赫伯特套住了一对鹑鸡，它们尾巴向外伸展开来，上面长着长长的羽毛，这些漂亮的黑凤冠雉很快就被驯服了。　至于鹈鹕、翠鸟和大鷭，它们都是主动来到家禽场岸边的，这个小群体刚开始有些争执，不停咕咕地叫、尖叫、咯咯的叫，不过最后都在这里安静地住下来了，它们的繁殖速度喜人，保证了将来开拓地的食物。","The first were the two tinamous, which were not long in having a number of young ones; they had for companions half a dozen ducks, accustomed to the borders of the lake.Some belonged to the Chinese species, of which the wings open like a fan, and which by the brilliancy of their plumage rival the golden pheasants.A few days afterwards, Herbert snared a couple of gallinaceae, with spreading tails composed of long feathers, magnificent alectors, which soon became tame.As to pelicans, kingfishers, water-hens, they came of themselves to the shores of the poultry-yard, and this little community, after some disputes, cooing, screaming, clucking, ended by settling down peacefully, and increased in encouraging proportion for the future use of the colony."
"赛勒斯·哈丁为了使自己的工作更完美，在家禽场的一处角落里建了一个鸽棚。他把十几只经常光顾高地的鸽子都安放在了这个鸽棚里。这些飞鸟很快就习惯了每天晚上飞回它们的新住所，而且，它们显示出比同类斑鸠更愿驯服自己的品性。","Cyrus Harding, wishing to complete his performance, established a pigeon-house in a corner of the poultry-yard.There he lodged a dozen of those pigeons which frequented the rocks of the plateau.These birds soon became accustomed to returning every evening to their new dwelling, and showed more disposition to domesticate themselves than their congeners, the wood-pigeons."
"终于，利用气球的时刻到了，他们把它剪成片，再做成衬衫和其他东西。而要保持气球的现状，再次冒险坐上充满气体的气球，飞在海上的高度极限他们自己也不知道，所以这种想法是不予考虑的。","Lastly, the time had come for turning the balloon-case to use, by cutting it up to make shirts and other articles; for as to keeping it in its present form, and risking themselves in a balloon filled with gas, above a sea of the limits of which they had no idea, it was not to be thought of."
"他们需要把气球运到花岗石宫，但开拓者们要想办法使车子变得更轻、更易控制。不过，就算他们有车子，拉车的动力仍在寻找中。","It was necessary to bring the case to Granite House, and the colonists employed themselves in rendering their heavy cart lighter and more manageable.But though they had a vehicle, the moving power was yet to be found."
"难道这个岛上就没有能替代牛、马或驴子位置的牲畜吗？这的确是个问题。","But did there not exist in the island some animal which might supply the place of the horse, ass, or ox?That was the question."
"“当然，”潘克洛夫说，“畜力对我们很有用，直到上尉做了辆蒸汽卡车，甚至是发动机，早晚有一天，从花岗石宫到气球港会有铁路，还有一条支线通往富兰克林山！”","“Certainly,” said Pencroft, “a beast of burden would be very useful to us until the captain has made a steam cart, or even an engine, for some day we shall have a railroad from Granite House to Port Balloon, with a branch line to Mount Franklin!”"
"12月23号这天，纳布和托普都大喊大叫，两个家伙显然在比谁能发出最大的喊声。在石窟忙着干活的居民赶快跑过来，担心出了什么伤脑筋的事。","One day, the 23rd of December, Neb and Top were heard shouting and barking, each apparently trying to see who could make the most noise.The settlers, who were busy at the Chimneys, ran, fearing some vexatious incident."
"猜猜他们看到什么了？原来，有两只大型的、驯良的动物从开放的桥梁上不小心闯进了高地。有人可能会说它们是马，至少是驴子，一公一母，体形健壮，身上是深灰色，四肢和尾巴是白色，而头和颈部则有黑色的条纹。它们安静地往前进，没有显示出任何的不安，盯着这几个人看，从中还认不出它们将来的主人。","What did they see?Two fine animals of a large size that had imprudently ventured on the plateau, when the bridges were open.One would have said they were horses, or at least donkeys, male and female, of a fine shape, dove-colored, the legs and tail white, striped with black on the head and neck.They advanced quietly without showing any uneasiness, and gazed at the men, in whom they could not as yet recognize their future masters."
"“这是野驴！”赫伯特喊道，“介于斑驴和斑马之间的动物！”","“These are onagers!” cried Herbert, “animals something between the zebra and the quagga!”"
"“为什么不叫驴子？”纳布问道。","“Why not donkeys?” asked Neb."
"“因为它们没有长长的耳朵，而且他们的外型更优雅！”","“Because they have not long ears, and their shape is more graceful!”"
"“不管是驴是马，”潘克洛夫打断他说，“他们就是上尉说的‘动力’，既然这样，我们得抓住它们！”","“Donkeys or horses,” interrupted Pencroft, “they are ‘moving powers,’ as the captain would say, and as such must be captured!”"
"水手在没有惊动动物们的情况下，悄悄爬过草地，来到甘油河上的桥梁边上，把桥放下来，于是野驴就成囚徒了。","The sailor, without frightening the animals, crept through the grass to the bridge over Creek Glycerine, lowered it, and the onagers were prisoners."
"那他们是不是应该使用暴力抓住它们，再用武力征服它们呢？不行。他们决定让这两个动物在高地自由地闲逛几天，那里有足够的草。工程师马上就开始在家禽场附近准备一个马厩，野驴在里面可以找到食物，还有舒服的垫子，晚上在这里安身。","Now, should they seize them with violence and master them by force?No.It was decided that for a few days they should be allowed to roam freely about the plateau, where there was an abundance of grass, and the engineer immediately began to prepare a stable near the poultry-yard, in which the onagers might find food, with a good litter, and shelter during the night."
"一切完毕后，这两只庞然大物就完全行动自由，居民们为了不让它们受到惊吓，甚至不靠近它们。不过，有几次这两只野驴似乎想离开高地，对于习惯在草原和森林的他们来说，在这里太受限了。接着，他们发现两只野驴开始沿着随处可见的水和栅栏走，发出几声短促的嘶声，在草地上飞奔，然后就变得驯服多了，它们会几个小时都盯着树林，它们永远与那里隔绝了。","This done, the movements of the two magnificent creatures were left entirely free, and the settlers avoided even approaching them so as to terrify them.Several times, however, the onagers appeared to wish to leave the plateau, too confined for animals accustomed to the plains and forests.They were then seen following the water-barrier which everywhere presented itself before them, uttering short neighs, then galloping through the grass, and becoming calmer, they would remain entire hours gazing at the woods, from which they were cut off for ever!"
"在这期间，他们用蔬菜纤维做成了挽具，捕获野驴几天后，他们不但就准备好了推车，还穿过远西森林开辟出了一条直道，更准确地说是一条近路，它是从慈悲河的拐角处到气球港。他们可以把车子推到那里，十二月底，他们第一次试驾野驴。","In the meantime harness of vegetable fiber had been manufactured, and some days after the capture of the onagers, not only the cart was ready, but a straight road, or rather a cutting, had been made through the forests of the Far West, from the angle of the Mercy to Port Balloon.The cart might then be driven there, and towards the end of December they tried the onagers for the first time."
"潘克洛夫已经学会了引诱动物出来吃他手里的食物，也能轻易靠近它们了，但是一放上挽具，它们就暴跳起来，很难控制住。不过，野驴很快就习惯了戴上挽具，它们不像斑马那般倔，在南非的山区，野驴经常要戴上挽具，在欧洲相对比较寒冷的地区也是如此。","Pencroft had already coaxed the animals to come and eat out of his hand, and they allowed him to approach without making any difficulty, but once harnessed they reared and could with difficulty be held in.However, it was not long before they submitted to this new service, for the onager, being less refractory than the zebra, is frequently put in harness in the mountainous regions of Southern Africa, and it has even been acclimatized in Europe, under zones of a relative coolness."
"这天，除了潘克洛夫坐在野驴头外，开拓者们都上了车，沿着道路前往气球港。","On this day all the colony, except Pencroft who walked at the animals’ heads, mounted the cart, and set out on the road to Port Balloon."
"他们在有些不平的道路上当然会颠簸，但驴车还是平安到达了目的地，很快，他们就往车上装好了气球的气囊和绳索。","Of course they were jolted over the somewhat rough road, but the vehicle arrived without any accident, and was soon loaded with the case and rigging of the balloon."
"当天晚上八点，驴车跨过慈悲河上的桥梁后，就顺着河流的左岸下来，停在了沙滩上。他们从野驴身上卸下挽具，然后把它们领到了马厩，睡觉前，潘克洛夫为释放情绪，满意地深深叹了口气，整个花岗石宫都是回声。","At eight o’clock that evening the cart, after passing over the Mercy bridge, descended the left bank of the river, and stopped on the beach.The onagers being unharnessed, were thence led to their stable, and Pencroft before going to sleep gave vent to his feelings in a deep sigh of satisfaction that awoke all the echoes of Granite House."
"第八章","Chapter 8"
"一月的第一个星期，大家都把心思放在了制作开拓者需要的亚麻布衣服上。他们在盒子里找到了针，虽然他们的手指并不纤细，但很有力，可以肯定的是，他们织出来的东西绝对结实。","The first week of January was devoted to the manufacture of the linen garments required by the colony.The needles found in the box were used by sturdy if not delicate fingers, and we may be sure that what was sewn was sewn firmly."
"线是有的，多亏了赛勒斯·哈丁的主意，想到可以重新用气球表面上的旧线。吉丁·史佩莱和赫伯特以惊人的耐心把旧线都拆下来了，之前潘克洛夫被迫放弃了这活，因为它超过了潘克洛夫的耐心底线，把他激怒了，不过他在做衣服这方面就没话说了。所有人都知道，水手都确实有非凡的做衣服才能。","There was no lack of thread, thanks to Cyrus Harding’s idea of re-employing that which had been already used in the covering of the balloon.This with admirable patience was all unpicked by Gideon Spilett and Herbert, for Pencroft had been obliged to give this work up, as it irritated him beyond measure; but he had no equal in the sewing part of the business.Indeed, everybody knows that sailors have a remarkable aptitude for tailoring."
"他们从焚烧植物的灰里提取出苏打和草碱，再把气囊用的棉布放在里面清洗，用这种方法，棉布的油漆被除去了，恢复了原有的柔软和弹性，然后在风中晾干后，很快就变得雪白。于是，他们做成几十件汗衫和袜子，当然袜子不是针织的，而是用棉布做成的。能再次穿上干净的亚麻布衣，对居民们来说太舒服了。虽然衣服相当粗糙，但他们并没那么挑剔！另外，他们还能在被单里睡觉，花岗石宫的卧榻也变成了相当舒适的床。","The cloth of which the balloon-case was made was then cleaned by means of soda and potash, obtained by the incineration of plants, in such a way that the cotton, having got rid of the varnish, resumed its natural softness and elasticity; then, exposed to the action of the atmosphere, it soon became perfectly white.Some dozen shirts and sock—the latter not knitted, of course, but made of cotton—were thus manufactured.What a comfort it was to the settlers to clothe themselves again in clean linen, which was doubtless rather rough, but they were not troubled about that! and then to go to sleep between sheets, which made the couches at Granite House into quite comfortable beds!"
"这时，他们还做好了几双海豹皮靴子，从美国穿来的鞋子和靴子太需要换下了。可以肯定的是，这些新鞋足够大，穿上去绝对不会挤脚。","It was about this time also that they made boots of seal-leather, which were greatly needed to replace the shoes and boots brought from America.We may be sure that these new shoes were large enough and never pinched the feet of the wearers."
"现在是1868年初，天气非常炎热，但是他们并未因此停止在森林里的打猎。森林里聚集了各种各样的猎物，像刺鼠、野猪、水豚和袋鼠，史佩莱和赫伯特这两位神枪手手法够准，没有浪费掉一发子弹。","With the beginning of the year 1866 the heat was very great, but the hunting in the forests did not stand still.Agouties, peccaries, capybaras, kangaroos, game of all sorts, actually swarmed there, and Spilett and Herbert were too good marksmen ever to throw away their shot uselessly."
"不过，赛勒斯·哈丁还是建议他们要节省弹药，他想办法找东西代替放在盒子里的火药和子弹，他希望把它们留着以后使用。如果要离开自己的领地，他怎么会知道命运某天会把他和同伴们抛在哪里呢？所以说，他们得为未知的未来准备着，节省弹药，备好火药，并找到容易更换的替代物。","Cyrus Harding still recommended them to husband the ammunition, and he took measures to replace the powder and shot which had been found in the box, and which he wished to reserve for the future.How did he know where chance might one day cast his companions and himself in the event of their leaving their domain?They should, then, prepare for the unknown future by husbanding their ammunition and by substituting for it some easily renewable substance."
"赛勒斯·哈丁在岛上找不到铅的痕迹，所以他用铁粒代替铅，这种铁粒制造起来也比较简单。这种铁粒子弹不像铅子弹那么重，所以他们就把铁粒做得大点，每个弹壳少装点火药，但射击手的好技术弥补了这点缺陷。至于说火药，赛勒斯·哈丁也能做出来，因为他手头上有硝石、硫磺和煤炭，不过制造火药要极度小心谨慎，要是没有特殊工具，想造出好的火药并不容易。因此，哈丁倾向于制造棉花火药，也就是火棉，它里面不一定要放棉花，因为基本的植物纤维都可以用，像大麻、亚麻、纸张和接骨木树心等植物的纤维都行，它们和棉花的纤维都几乎是纯净的。林肯岛上的红河河口就长满了这种接骨木树，它属于忍冬科植物，开拓者们早就用这些灌木的果实做过咖啡喝了。","To replace lead, of which Harding had found no traces in the island, he employed granulated iron, which was easy to manufacture.These bullets, not having the weight of leaden bullets, were made larger, and each charge contained less, but the skill of the sportsmen made up this deficiency.As to powder, Cyrus Harding would have been able to make that also, for he had at his disposal saltpeter, sulphur, and coal; but this preparation requires extreme care, and without special tools it is difficult to produce it of a good quality.Harding preferred, therefore, to manufacture pyroxyle, that is to say gun-cotton, a substance in which cotton is not indispensable, as the elementary tissue of vegetables may be used, and this is found in an almost pure state, not only in cotton, but in the textile fiber of hemp and flax, in paper, the pith of the elder, etc.Now, the elder abounded in the island towards the mouth of Red Creek, and the colonists had already made coffee of the berries of these shrubs, which belong to the family of the caprifoliaceae."
"因此，要采集的就只有接骨木的树心，因为制造火棉所需的另外一种物品就是发烟硝酸。现在，哈丁手里有硫酸，只要加入硝石就能轻易得到硝酸，从而大可以为他提供硝石。于是，他决定开始制造火棉以投入使用。虽然火棉有些缺陷，就是说效果不稳定，很容易自燃，它的燃点只有170度，而不是240度，而且，火棉会突然走火，容易损坏枪支。不过从另一方面来讲，火棉也有它的优点，它不容易受潮，也不会弄脏枪筒，而且它的火力是一般火药的四倍。","The only thing to be collected, therefore, was elder-pith, for as to the other substance necessary for the manufacture of pyroxyle, it was only fuming azotic acid.Now, Harding having sulphuric acid at his disposal, had already been easily able to produce azotic acid by attacking the saltpeter with which nature supplied him.He accordingly resolved to manufacture and employ pyroxyle, although it has some inconveniences, that is to say, a great inequality of effect, an excessive inflammability, since it takes fire at one hundred and seventy degrees instead of two hundred and forty, and lastly, an instantaneous deflagration which might damage the firearms.On the other hand, the advantages of pyroxyle consist in this, that it is not injured by damp, that it does not make the gun-barrels dirty, and that its force is four times that of ordinary powder."
"若要造出棉花火药，棉花必须在发烟硝酸里浸泡一刻钟，然后在清水中洗净，最后晾干。没有比这更简单的活了。","To make pyroxyle, the cotton must be immersed in the fuming azotic acid for a quarter of an hour, then washed in cold water and dried.Nothing could be more simple."
"赛勒斯·哈丁手里只有普通硝酸，而不是所需的发烟硝酸或硝酸单水化合物，这种硝酸一旦与潮湿的空气接触，就会散发出白色的水汽。不过把后一种物质换成普通硝酸，在里面加入三到五倍的高浓度硫酸，工程师也取得了想要的效果。因此，岛上的射击手们很快就拿到了精心准备的火药，由于使用谨慎，它们也发挥出了惊人的效果。","Cyrus Harding had only at his disposal the ordinary azotic acid and not the fuming or monohydrate azotic acid, that is to say, acid which emits white vapors when it comes in contact with damp air; but by substituting for the latter ordinary azotic acid, mixed, in the proportion of from three to five volumes of concentrated sulphuric acid, the engineer obtained the same result.The sportsmen of the island therefore soon had a perfectly prepared substance, which, employed discreetly, produced admirable results."
"这时，居民们在高地上开辟出了三英亩的区域，为了野驴着想，剩下的地方保留着原生态。他们去了几次啄木鸟林和远西森林远足，从那里带回来了许多野菜、菠菜、水芹、萝卜和芜菁。只要细心培育，它们很快就能长起来，他们用以维持生计的食物也能得到很好的搭配。成车的木材和煤炭也都用车运来了。每一次出行的同时也意味着马路的修整，车轮的倾轧使马路变得越来越平坦了。","About this time the settlers cleared three acres of the plateau, and the rest was preserved in a wild state, for the benefit of the onagers.Several excursions were made into the Jacamar Wood and the forests of the Far West, and they brought back from thence a large collection of wild vegetables, spinach, cress, radishes, and turnips, which careful culture would soon improve, and which would temper the regimen on which the settlers had till then subsisted.Supplies of wood and coal were also carted.Each excursion was at the same time a means of improving the roads, which gradually became smoother under the wheels of the cart."
"养兔场继续为花岗石宫的食物储藏室供应肉类。幸好养兔场坐落在甘油河的对岸，不然里面的动物就要跑到高地，损坏新辟出来的菜地了。岩石中间的蛤蛎场经常补充新的东西，为他们提供了上等软体动物。除此之外，不论是在格兰特湖或是在慈悲河，钓鱼都会有大丰收。因为潘克洛夫做了几条装有铁钩的钓线，于是他们经常抓到美味的鳟鱼，还有一种金色腹部上布满黄色斑点的鱼，这种鱼也极其好吃。擅长烹饪技术的纳布大厨，还懂得适时变换菜单。现在居民们的餐桌上只缺面包了，如前面所说，这是他们特别需要的。","The rabbit-warren still continued to supply the larder of Granite House.As fortunately it was situated on the other side of Creek Glycerine, its inhabitants could not reach the plateau nor ravage the newly-made plantation.The oyster-bed among the rocks was frequently renewed and furnished excellent molluscs.Besides that, the fishing, either in the lake or the Mercy, was very profitable, for Pencroft had made some lines, armed with iron hooks, with which they frequently caught fine trout, and a species of fish whose silvery sides were speckled with yellow, and which were also extremely savory.Master Neb, who was skilled in the culinary art, knew how to vary agreeably the bill of fare.Bread alone was wanting at the table of the settlers, and as has been said, they felt this privation greatly."
"居民们还能捕到经常光顾颚角海岸的海龟。这片海滩布满小丘，很好地藏着圆滚滚的海龟蛋。白色的蛋壳很硬，蛋白不像鸟蛋蛋白那样凝结着。海龟蛋会在太阳下孵化，由于每只海龟每年产252个蛋，所以孵出来的海龟数量自然相当可观。","The settlers hunted too the turtles which frequented the shores of Cape Mandible.At this place the beach was covered with little mounds, concealing perfectly spherical turtles’ eggs, with white hard shells, the albumen of which does not coagulate as that of birds’ eggs.They were hatched by the sun, and their number was naturally considerable, as each turtle can lay annually two hundred and fifty."
"“这是一块普通的海龟蛋集中区，”吉丁·史佩莱说，“看来我们只能把这些蛋捡起来了。”","“A regular egg-field,” observed Gideon Spilett, “and we have nothing to do but to pick them up.”"
"不过他们并没有满足于只收集海龟蛋，而是开始搜寻产蛋的海龟。终于，他们为花岗石宫带来了十几只海龟，这些动物着实能为居民们增添不少营养。纳布用香草调剂海龟汤，美味的汤赢得了大家的啧啧称赞。","But not being contented with simply the produce, they made chase after the producers, the result of which was that they were able to bring back to Granite House a dozen of these chelonians, which were really valuable from an alimentary point of view.The turtle soup, flavored with aromatic herbs, often gained well-merited praises for its preparer, Neb."
"在此我们还得提到另一件幸事，那就是大家找到了可以为冬天储备新食物的地方。成群的鲑鱼游进了慈悲河，并上行了几英里远。这段时间正是雌鱼准备找合适的地方产卵的时节，它们引来了无数雄鱼，在淡水里发出很大声响。一千多条鲑鱼游进了河，它们长2.5英尺。穿过河流的水坝建成后，鱼就更多了。他们抓了一百多条鲑鱼，腌制后就为冬天储藏起来，那时河流结冰，就不能捕鱼了。到这个时候，聪明的贾普已经能够担当仆人的责任了。他穿上了一件夹克，白色亚麻裤，还有一条围裙，上面的口袋是他喜欢的。这个充满灵性的猩猩已经被纳布教导成了训练有素的仆人，任何人都可能会以为，黑人纳布和猩猩说话时，他们能听懂对方的语言。贾普真的很喜欢纳布，纳布对它也是一样。贾普的工作一般是搬木头或爬到树顶，当它不用干这些活时，大部分时间会在厨房里，努力模仿它所看到的纳布的全部工作。黑人纳布在教导这位学生时，相当有耐心，甚至是热情极高，学生也因从主人那里学到的课程而获益，展现了非凡的智慧。","We must here mention another fortunate circumstance by which new stores for the winter were laid in.Shoals of salmon entered the Mercy, and ascended the country for several miles.It was the time at which the females, going to find suitable places in which to spawn, precede the males and make a great noise through the fresh water.A thousand of these fish, which measured about two feet and a half in length, came up the river, and a large quantity were retained by fixing dams across the stream.More than a hundred were thus taken, which were salted and stored for the time when winter, freezing up the streams, would render fishing impracticable.By this time the intelligent Jup was raised to the duty of valet.He had been dressed in a jacket, white linen breeches, and an apron, the pockets of which were his delight.The clever orang had been marvelously trained by Neb, and any one would have said that the Negro and the ape understood each other when they talked together.Jup had besides a real affection for Neb, and Neb returned it.When his services were not required, either for carrying wood or for climbing to the top of some tree, Jup passed the greatest part of his time in the kitchen, where he endeavored to imitate Neb in all that he saw him do.The black showed the greatest patience and even extreme zeal in instructing his pupil, and the pupil exhibited remarkable intelligence in profiting by the lessons he received from his master."
"贾普给花岗石宫的居民们带来了意想不到的快乐。有一天，贾普胳膊上挂了一条餐巾，站在餐桌旁准备服侍大家。他动作迅速，神情专注，出色地行使着自己的职责，给大家换盘子、递碟子、倒水，那严肃的神情把大家都乐坏了，潘克洛夫更是笑得前仰后合。","Judge then of the pleasure Master Jup gave to the inhabitants of Granite House when, without their having had any idea of it, he appeared one day, napkin on his arm, ready to wait at table.Quick, attentive, he acquitted himself perfectly, changing the plates, bringing dishes, pouring out water, all with a gravity which gave intense amusement to the settlers, and which enraptured Pencroft."
"“贾普，上汤！”","“Jup, some soup!”"
"“贾普，来点刺鼠肉！”","“Jup, a little agouti!”"
"“贾普，盘子！”","“Jup, a plate!”"
"“贾普！好贾普！忠实的贾普！”","“Jup!Good Jup!Honest Jup!”"
"餐桌上只听见这些，不过贾普并没有慌乱，回应每个人的要求，照看着一切，而当潘克洛夫提起见到贾普的第一天开过的玩笑时，贾普摇了摇头，好像听懂了一样。他对贾普说：","Nothing was heard but that, and Jup without ever being disconcerted, replied to every one, watched for everything, and he shook his head in a knowing way when Pencroft, referring to his joke of the first day, said to him,—"
"“贾普，显然我们要让你的薪水翻倍了。”","“Decidedly, Jup, your wages must be doubled.”"
"毫无疑问，这只猩猩在花岗石宫已经完全被驯服了，它经常陪伴主人去森林，但从未表现出想要离开他们的意思。它走路时，肩上扛着潘克洛夫给他的木棍，就像扛着枪一样，那样子看着非常好笑。他们要是想从树顶摘水果，贾普就很快地爬上去了。如果车轮陷到泥里了，贾普只用他一个肩膀的力量举，车轮就出来了。","It is useless to say that the orang was now thoroughly domesticated at Granite House, and that he often accompanied his masters to the forest without showing any wish to leave them.It was most amusing to see him walking with a stick which Pencroft had given him, and which he carried on his shoulder like a gun.If they wished to gather some fruit from the summit of a tree, how quickly he climbed for it.If the wheel of the cart stuck in the mud, with what energy did Jup with a single heave of his shoulder put it right again."
"“多可爱的家伙啊！”潘克洛夫经常这么喊，“它要是也相当调皮的话，那我们就拿它没有什么办法了！”","“What a jolly fellow he is!” cried Pencroft often.“If he was as mischievous as he is good, there would be no doing anything with him!”"
"快到一月底的时候，开拓者们开始在岛屿的中部干活。他们决定在红河发源地附近的富兰克林山脚建一个畜栏，用来圈养反刍动物，它们的出现会为花岗石宫带来一些麻烦，尤其是会侵扰到为居民们的冬衣提供绒毛的摩弗伦羊。","It was towards the end of January the colonists began their labors in the center of the island.It had been decided that a corral should be established near the sources of the Red Creek, at the foot of Mount Franklin, destined to contain the ruminants, whose presence would have been troublesome at Granite House, and especially for the musmons, who were to supply the wool for the settlers’ winter garments."
"每天早晨，开拓者们——有时是所有人，但大多数时间都只有哈丁、赫伯特和潘克洛夫三人——会沿着新开辟的路，他们称为畜栏路，来到不到五英里外的红河发源地。","Each morning, the colony, sometimes entire, but more often represented only by Harding, Herbert, and Pencroft, proceeded to the sources of the Creek, a distance of not more than five miles, by the newly beaten road to which the name of Corral Road had been given."
"他们选取了富兰克林山南部山脊后的一个地方。这是一块草地，上面到处长着一丛丛树，一条小溪从它一边的山坡上流下来，浇灌着这些树。这里的草很新鲜，四周的树木没有为这些树遮多少荫。他们打算在草地周围建一座相当高的围栏，再矫捷的动物也跳不进去。围栏还要足够大，得容纳一百只摩弗伦羊、野山羊以及将来出生的羊羔。","There a site was chosen, at the back of the southern ridge of the mountain.It was a meadow land, dotted here and there with clumps of trees, and watered by a little stream, which sprung from the slopes which closed it in on one side.The grass was fresh, and it was not too much shaded by the trees which grew about it.This meadow was to be surrounded by a palisade, high enough to prevent even the most agile animals from leaping over.This enclosure would be large enough to contain a hundred musmons and wild goats, with all the young ones they might produce."
"工程师划出了畜栏的边界，接着他们就要开始砍伐修栅栏用的树木，不过，由于修路的时候砍了很多树，他们直接裁出了一百个木桩，并把它们牢牢地固定在地上。","The perimeter of the corral was then traced by the engineer, and they would then have proceeded to fell the trees necessary for the construction of the palisade, but as the opening up of the road had already necessitated the sacrifice of a considerable number, those were brought and supplied a hundred stakes, which were firmly fixed in the ground."
"修建畜栏花了三个多星期的时间，因为赛勒斯·哈丁不光修了栅栏，还建了大型兽棚，供动物居住。这些兽棚也必须造得非常结实，因为摩弗伦羊力气都很大，第一次见到的它们兽性大发的样子是很吓人的。木桩的顶端都削尖了，用火烤过后也变硬了，他们用横木将木桩钉在一起，每隔一段距离放一个桩子，保证了整个栅栏的稳固。","The construction of this corral did not take less than three weeks, for besides the palisade, Cyrus Harding built large sheds, in which the animals could take shelter.These buildings had also to be made very strong, for musmons are powerful animals, and their first fury was to be feared.The stakes, sharpened at their upper end and hardened by fire, had been fixed by means of cross-bars, and at regular distances props assured the solidity of the whole."
"畜栏建成以后，他们就该对经常光顾草地的反刍动物进行搜捕了。他们选定了2月7号，在一个美丽的夏日进行，所有人都出动了。两匹野驴已经训练有素，史佩莱和赫伯特骑着它们，野驴发挥了重要作用。","The corral finished, a raid had to be made on the pastures frequented by the ruminants.This was done on the 7th of February, on a beautiful summer’s day, and every one took part in it.The onagers, already well trained, were ridden by Spilett and Herbert, and were of great use."
"他们的策略很简单，就是围住摩弗伦羊和山羊，然后逐渐缩小包围圈。赛勒斯·哈丁、潘克洛夫、纳布和贾普都各自在树林里找地方守好了，而两位骑士和托普则在畜栏周边半英里范围内飞奔。","The maneuver consisted simply in surrounding the musmons and goats, and gradually narrowing the circle around them.Cyrus Harding, Pencroft, Neb, and Jup, posted themselves in different parts of the wood, while the two cavaliers and Top galloped in a radius of half a mile round the corral."
"荒岛上的这块地方有相当多的摩弗伦羊。这种优等动物的体积和鹿一般大，它们的角比公绵羊角要硬，灰色的底绒里还掺杂着长毛。","The musmons were very numerous in this part of the island.These fine animals were as large as deer; their horns were stronger than those of the ram, and their gray-colored fleece was mixed with long hair."
"打了一天猎很是累人。他们来回奔跑，骑着野驴，还要大声喊叫！他们包围了一百只摩弗伦羊，虽然三分之二以上的都逃走了，但他们最后还是得到了30只，另外，10只野山羊也慢慢被赶到畜栏口，开口处看似提供了逃跑通道，它们跑进里面，成为了囚徒。","This hunting day was very fatiguing.Such going and coming, and running and riding and shouting!Of a hundred musmons which had been surrounded, more than two-thirds escaped, but at last, thirty of these animals and ten wild goats were gradually driven back towards the corral, the open door of which appearing to offer a means of escape, they rushed in and were prisoners."
"总之，最终的收获是很令人满意的，居民们也没有什么好抱怨的。有了这肯定会不断繁殖的一群动物，在不远的将来，不光是棉毛，就连皮革也会源源不断了。","In short, the result was satisfactory, and the settlers had no reason to complain.There was no doubt that the flock would prosper, and that at no distant time not only wool but hides would be abundant."
"当天晚上，猎人们回到了花岗石宫，他们已经筋疲力竭了。不过，他们虽然很累，第二天还是要去看一下畜栏。里面的俘虏们试图越过栅栏，不过当然是不会成功的，很快它们就变得温顺多了。","That evening the hunters returned to Granite House quite exhausted.However, notwithstanding their fatigue, they returned the next day to visit the corral.The prisoners had been trying to overthrow the palisade, but of course had not succeeded, and were not long in becoming more tranquil."
"整个二月都没有什么重要的事发生。大家每天有条不紊地干活，修整通往畜栏和气球港的路，还开始修建第三条路，从围栏延伸至西部海岸。目前林肯岛上的未知区域就是树木覆盖的盘蛇半岛，里面住着野兽，吉丁·史佩莱特别想把它们从领地上清出去。","During the month of February, no event of any importance occurred.The daily labors were pursued methodically, and, as well as improving the roads to the corral and to Port Balloon, a third was commenced, which, starting from the enclosure, proceeded towards the western coast.The yet unknown portion of Lincoln Island was that of the wood-covered Serpentine Peninsula, which sheltered the wild beasts, from which Gideon Spilett was so anxious to clear their domain."
"在寒冷的季节到来之前，他们的主要任务就是精心培育从森林移植到眺望岗的野生植物。赫伯特每次出行都会带回来一些有用的蔬菜。有时候，他会带回来一些菊苣类植物的标本，这种植物的籽可以压制成上好的油；有时他还会带回来一些常见的酸模，它们具有治疗坏血病的功效，是不容忽视的；还有的时候，他会带回来珍稀块茎，它们一般都种在南美，还有马铃薯，目前其种类已经超过200种。现在菜园里有各种各样的蔬菜，经过小心防卫，没有鸟类侵害，地被分为小块，上面种着莴苣、肾形红皮马铃薯、酸模、芜菁、萝卜和其他十字花科植物。高地上的土壤相当肥沃，丰收是很有希望的。","Before the cold season should appear the most assiduous care was given to the cultivation of the wild plants which had been transplanted from the forest to Prospect Heights.Herbert never returned from an excursion without bringing home some useful vegetable.One day, it was some specimens of the chicory tribe, the seeds of which by pressure yield an excellent oil; another, it was some common sorrel, whose antiscorbutic qualities were not to be despised; then, some of those precious tubers, which have at all times been cultivated in South America, potatoes, of which more than two hundred species are now known.The kitchen garden, now well stocked and carefully defended from the birds, was divided into small beds, where grew lettuces, kidney potatoes, sorrel, turnips, radishes, and other coneiferae.The soil on the plateau was particularly fertile, and it was hoped that the harvests would be abundant."
"他们还有各种各样的饮料，只要不想喝酒，即便最难取悦的人也没有理由抱怨。除了大红香蜂草茶，以及从麒麟树树根中提取发酵的酒以外，哈丁还酿造了一种啤酒，他将冷云杉的嫩芽放在水里煮沸后再发酵，最后就做成了被英裔美国人称为泉水啤酒的可口饮品。","They had also a variety of different beverages, and so long as they did not demand wine, the most hard to please would have had no reason to complain.To the Oswego tea, and the fermented liquor extracted from the roots of the dragonnier, Harding had added a regular beer, made from the young shoots of the spruce-fir, which, after having been boiled and fermented, made that agreeable drink called by the Anglo-Americans spring-beer."
"夏天快结束的时候，家禽场里有了一对优良的大鸨，它们属于鸨类，其特别之处在于身上长满了羽毛；还有十几只琵嘴鸭，它们的上颚两边都长了片长膜；还有几只美丽的公鸡，这种鸡和莫桑比克公鸡很像，它的鸡冠、肉垂和表皮都是黑色的。到目前为止，在这几位智勇双全的男士的辛勤劳作下，一切都很顺利。虽然大自然无疑为他们准备了很多，但他们还是秉持自己的原则，充分利用造物主慷慨的赐予。","Towards the end of the summer, the poultry-yard was possessed of a couple of fine bustards, which belonged to the houbara species, characterized by a sort of feathery mantle; a dozen shovelers, whose upper mandible was prolonged on each side by a membraneous appendage; and also some magnificent cocks, similar to the Mozambique cocks, the comb, caruncle, and epidermis being black.So far, everything had succeeded, thanks to the activity of these courageous and intelligent men.Nature did much for them, doubtless; but faithful to the great precept, they made a right use of what a bountiful Providence gave them."
"在炎热的夏季里，夜间当高温离去的时候，海风徐徐吹来，他们干完活后喜欢坐在眺望岗的边缘上，这里已经被纳布用爬藤盖住，改造成了小阳台。他们相互交谈，给对方提意见，还会规划未来，而水手那蹩脚的幽默感常常为这个小世界带来快乐，在这里，人们相处得总是很融洽。","After the heat of these warm summer days, in the evening when their work was finished and the sea-breeze began to blow, they liked to sit on the edge of Prospect Heights, in a sort of veranda, covered with creepers, which Neb had made with his own hands.There they talked, they instructed each other, they made plans, and the rough good-humor of the sailor always amused this little world, in which the most perfect harmony had never ceased to reign."
"他们经常谈起自己的祖国，伟大而可爱的美国。南北战争的结果怎么样了？战争不可能持续太久。里士满肯定很快就要落入格兰特将军的手里。南部联邦的首府被攻破肯定是这场可怕的战争的最终结局。现在北方军取得了正义的胜利，这些逃到林肯岛上的居民们是多么想要一份报纸啊！11个月以来，他们与其他同胞的联系都被阻断了，3月24号很快就要来了，那天是他们被气球扔到这个未知海岸的纪念日。那一天，他们变成了落难者，在恶劣天气的肆虐下，他们都不知道该如何保全自己的不幸生命。可是现在，在上尉丰富的经验和同伴各自智慧的帮助下，他们已经有各种武器、工具和设备，成为了岛上的正式居民。他们还学会了利用荒岛上的动物、植物和矿产，也就是自然界的三大物类。","They often spoke of their country, of their dear and great America.What was the result of the War of Secession?It could not have been greatly prolonged.Richmond had doubtless soon fallen into the hands of General Grant.The taking of the capital of the Confederates must have been the last action of this terrible struggle.Now the North had triumphed in the good cause, how welcome would have been a newspaper to the exiles in Lincoln Island!For eleven months all communication between them and the rest of their fellow-creatures had been interrupted, and in a short time the 24th of March would arrive, the anniversary of the day on which the balloon had thrown them on this unknown coast.They were then mere castaways, not even knowing how they should preserve their miserable lives from the fury of the elements!And now, thanks to the knowledge of their captain, and their own intelligence, they were regular colonists, furnished with arms, tools, and instruments; they had been able to turn to their profit the animals, plants, and minerals of the island, that is to say, the three kingdoms of Nature."
"是的，他们常常会谈起这些，还会做更多的规划。","Yes; they often talked of all these things and formed still more plans."
"赛勒斯·哈丁大部分时间都很安静，他总是聆听伙伴们说的话，说的却比较少。有时赫伯特会想出新点子，抑或潘克洛夫说出不着边际的话，他都会笑一笑，不管在哪里，他总在思考那些难以解释的事实，可他至今还没有猜透里面的谜！","As to Cyrus Harding he was for the most part silent, and listened to his companions more often than he spoke to them.Sometimes he smiled at Herbert’s ideas or Pencroft’s nonsense, but always and everywhere he pondered over those inexplicable facts, that strange enigma, of which the secret still escaped him!"
"第九章","Chapter 9"
"三月的第一个星期，天气有了变化。月初的时候，月亮还很圆，天气也很热。大气里似乎充斥着电流，恐怕未来几天要有暴风雨了。","The weather changed during the first week of March.There had been a full moon at the commencement of the month, and the heat was excessive.The atmosphere was felt to be full of electricity, and a period of some length of tempestuous weather was to be feared."
"果然不出所料，3月2号那天，隆隆的雷声传来，狂风从东边刮过来，冰雹像齐射的葡萄弹似的打在花岗石宫的表面上。他们赶紧关上门窗，不然屋里所有的东西都要弄湿了。这些冰雹有的像鸽子蛋那么大，潘克洛夫一下子就想到他的庄稼地有危险了。","Indeed, on the 2nd, peals of thunder were heard, the wind blew from the east, and hail rattled against the facade of Granite House like volleys of grape-shot.The door and windows were immediately closed, or everything in the rooms would have been drenched.On seeing these hailstones, some of which were the size of a pigeon’s egg, Pencroft’s first thought was that his cornfield was in serious danger."
"他立马就跑到了庄稼地，里面的庄稼都冒出小绿苗了，他拿了很大一块布遮挡，保护他的庄稼。","He directly rushed to his field, where little green heads were already appearing, and by means of a great cloth, he managed to protect his crop."
"糟糕的天气持续了一个星期，在这几天，雷声总是不绝于耳地从高空传来。","This bad weather lasted a week, during which time the thunder rolled without cessation in the depths of the sky."
"开拓者们没有什么迫切需要出去做的事，所以就趁天气不好的时候在花岗石宫里面干活，一天天过去了，屋子里的布置越来越完备了。工程师造出了一台车床，并用它做了几件厕所和厨房的用具，特别是他们现在紧缺的纽扣。他还造了一个放置火器的枪炮，并小心翼翼地保管好，桌子和橱柜也都不缺了。他们锯的锯，刨的刨，锉的锉，铣的铣，在天气糟糕的这段时间里，只有打磨工具的声音和车床的嗡嗡声，回应着轰隆隆的雷声。","The colonists, not having any pressing work out of doors, profited by the bad weather to work at the interior of Granite House, the arrangement of which was becoming more complete from day to day.The engineer made a turning-lathe, with which he turned several articles both for the toilet and the kitchen, particularly buttons, the want of which was greatly felt.A gunrack had been made for the firearms, which were kept with extreme care, and neither tables nor cupboards were left incomplete.They sawed, they planed, they filed, they turned; and during the whole of this bad season, nothing was heard but the grinding of tools or the humming of the turning-lathe which responded to the growling of the thunder."
"大伙也没有忘了贾普，他在后院的储藏室边有一间自己的屋子，这个房间有点像船舱，里面的吊床装满了合他胃口的干草。","Master Jup had not been forgotten, and he occupied a room at the back, near the storeroom, a sort of cabin with a cot always full of good litter, which perfectly suited his taste."
"“好杰普从来不吵嘴，”潘克洛夫经常这样夸赞道，“也不会强辩。多好的仆人，纳布，多好的仆人啊！”","“With good old Jup there is never any quarreling,” often repeated Pencroft, “never any improper reply.What a servant, Neb, what a servant!”"
"当然，贾普现在很习惯给大家服务了。它给大伙刷衣服、烤肉、伺候大家吃饭、打扫房间、采集木材，它的另外一项贴心服务更是让潘克洛夫相当满意，那就是不把可敬的水手伺候得上床睡觉，它是绝不会先睡的。","Of course Jup was now well used to service.He brushed their clothes, he turned the spit, he waited at table, he swept the rooms, he gathered wood, and he performed another admirable piece of service which delighted Pencroft—he never went to sleep without first coming to tuck up the worthy sailor in his bed."
"至于说开拓地成员们的健康，不论两足动物还是两手动物、四手类或四足类，都还挺健壮。户外的生活，有益健康的的土壤，温带气候，加之体力与脑力活动相结合，他们也就不可能想到疾病会侵袭自己。","As to the health of the members of the colony, bipeds or bimana, quadrumana or quadrupeds, it left nothing to be desired.With their life in the open air, on this salubrious soil, under that temperate zone, working both with head and hands, they could not suppose that illness would ever attack them."
"大家的确也都非常健康。赫伯特这一年长了两英尺。他的身体逐渐发育，很快就变得更像个大人了，他还立志要让自己成为德才兼备、身强体健的全能之才。一干完体力活，他就在空闲时间提升自己。箱子里的书他都翻来看了，除了实际的生活需要获取知识外，他还向工程师学习科学，向记者学习语言，这些老师都是很乐意把他教育好的。","All were indeed wonderfully well.Herbert had already grown two inches in the year.His figure was forming and becoming more manly, and he promised to be an accomplished man, physically as well as morally.Besides he improved himself during the leisure hours which manual occupations left to him; he read the books found in the case; and after the practical lessons which were taught by the very necessity of their position, he found in the engineer for science, and the reporter for languages, masters who were delighted to complete his education."
"3月9号这天，暴风雨过去了，不过，夏季的最后一个月里天空一直布满云朵。空气由于雷电天气的影响，被剧烈搅动着，不再像先前那么纯净了。除了外出打猎那三四天的天气比较晴朗以外，其他时间一直都是下雨或起雾。这时候，母驴也生了一头小母驴，小驴子长得很快。畜栏里的摩弗伦羊群也变多了，几只羊羔已经在兽棚里咩咩叫喊起来，纳布和赫伯特听了都非常高兴，在这群新来者中，他们各有自己最喜欢的羊羔。另外，居民们还试着驯化野猪，最后的结果也都挺成功。家禽场下面还建了一个猪圈，很快里面就有了几只猪崽，它们逐渐变得开化了，也就是说，在纳布的照料下愈来愈肥了。贾普负责每天给猪崽喂饲料、厨房的剩菜剩饭等等，它干得十分尽心。有时候它会拿猪崽逗乐，拽它们的尾巴玩，不过这只是淘气，不能说是残忍，它把这些小尾巴都当成好玩的东西了，贾普的天性就和孩子一样。就在三月的一天，潘克洛夫在和工程师说话的时候，正好提醒了赛勒斯·哈丁一件他允诺过的事，但后来还没有时间完成。","The tempest ended about the 9th of March, but the sky remained covered with clouds during the whole of this last summer month.The atmosphere, violently agitated by the electric commotions, could not recover its former purity, and there was almost invariably rain and fog, except for three or four fine days on which several excursions were made.About this time the female onager gave birth to a young one which belonged to the same sex as its mother, and which throve capitally.In the corral, the flock of musmons had also increased, and several lambs already bleated in the sheds, to the great delight of Neb and Herbert, who had each their favorite among these newcomers.An attempt was also made for the domestication of the peccaries, which succeeded well.A sty was constructed under the poultry-yard, and soon contained several young ones in the way to become civilized, that is to say, to become fat under Neb’s care.Master Jup, entrusted with carrying them their daily nourishment, leavings from the kitchen, etc., acquitted himself conscientiously of his task.He sometimes amused himself at the expense of his little pensioners by tweaking their tails; but this was mischief, and not wickedness, for these little twisted tails amused him like a plaything, and his instinct was that of a child.One day in this month of March, Pencroft, talking to the engineer, reminded Cyrus Harding of a promise which the latter had not as yet had time to fulfil."
"“上尉，你说过一种仪器，将代替花岗石宫的长梯，”潘克洛夫说，“你以后不做它了吗？”","“You once spoke of an apparatus which would take the place of the long ladders at Granite House, captain,” said he; “won’t you make it some day?”"
"“这个再简单不过了，不过它真的有用吗？”","“Nothing will be easier; but is this a really useful thing?”"
"“当然了，上尉。我们的必需品都自给自足后，让我们想点奢侈的东西。对我们来说这或许是奢侈品，如果你这样想，可是对搬运东西来说，那就是必需品了。背着沉重的东西爬那么长的梯子，实在是很不方便。”","“Certainly, captain.After we have given ourselves necessaries, let us think a little of luxury.For us it may be luxury, if you like, but for things it is necessary.It isn’t very convenient to climb up a long ladder when one is heavily loaded.”"
"“好吧，潘克洛夫，我们会让你满意的。”赛勒斯·哈丁回答说。","“Well, Pencroft, we will try to please you,” replied Cyrus Harding."
"“可是你手头没有机器！”","“But you have no machine at your disposal.”"
"“我们可以造一个。”","“We will make one.”"
"“一个蒸汽机？”","“A steam machine?”"
"“不对，是一架水压机。”","“No, a water machine.”"
"事实上，工程师手中有现成的自然力，他可以毫不费劲地借助这种力量使装置运转。为此，只要增强供应花岗石宫内部用水的小水流，就足够了。工程师拓宽了石头与草地之间的开口，使得通道底部形成了湍急的瀑布，通道里漫出来的水最后由地下井流出去了。工程师在瀑布的下方装了一个带有螺旋桨的圆筒，和外面的轮盘连接在一起，轮盘上缠绕着一根结实的绳索，而绳索下面则挂着一个吊篮。这样一来，他们就可以通过一根接触地面的绳子调节动力，继而乘坐吊篮一直升到花岗石宫门口。","And, indeed, to work his apparatus there was already a natural force at the disposal of the engineer which could be used without great difficulty.For this, it was enough to augment the flow of the little stream which supplied the interior of Granite House with water.The opening among the stones and grass was then increased, thus producing a strong fall at the bottom of the passage, the overflow from which escaped by the inner well.Below this fall the engineer fixed a cylinder with paddles, which was joined on the exterior with a strong cable rolled on a wheel, supporting a basket.In this way, by means of a long rope reaching to the ground, which enabled them to regulate the motive power, they could rise in the basket to the door of Granite House."
"就在3月17号这天，升降梯第一次投入使用，大家对结果都非常满意。从这以后，升降机代替了原有的梯子，包括木材、煤炭、食物，甚至连居民在内的所有重物都可以通过这个简易装置上上下下了，可想而知，没有人对这项改变后悔。托普对装置的改进更是兴奋不已，因为此前它没有、也绝不会有贾普那样的爬梯技术，而只能趴在纳布后背，或是猩猩的后背，才能登上花岗石宫。这时赛勒斯·哈丁也想尝试做一些玻璃，他先是把那只旧的陶土炉子用在了这个新任务上。虽然也遇到了一些困难，但经过几次失败的尝试之后，他成功搭建出了一个玻璃工厂，吉丁·史佩莱和赫伯特这两位老助手，好几天都没有离开过他身边。用来制作玻璃的材料只是些沙子、白垩、苏打、碳酸盐或硫酸盐。现在海滩上有沙子，石灰里有白垩，海藻里有苏打，黄铁矿里有硫酸，地里有煤，可以用来将陶土炉子加热到需要的温度。赛勒斯·哈丁很快就准备好了开工所需的一切东西。","It was on the 17th of March that the lift acted for the first time, and gave universal satisfaction.Henceforward all the loads, wood, coal, provisions, and even the settlers themselves, were hoisted by this simple system, which replaced the primitive ladder, and, as may be supposed, no one thought of regretting the change.Top particularly was enchanted with this improvement, for he had not, and never could have possessed Master Jup’s skill in climbing ladders, and often it was on Neb’s back, or even on that of the orang that he had been obliged to make the ascent to Granite House.About this time, too, Cyrus Harding attempted to manufacture glass, and he at first put the old pottery-kiln to this new use.There were some difficulties to be encountered; but, after several fruitless attempts, he succeeded in setting up a glass manufactory, which Gideon Spilett and Herbert, his usual assistants, did not leave for several days.As to the substances used in the composition of glass, they are simply sand, chalk, and soda, either carbonate or sulphate.Now the beach supplied sand, lime supplied chalk, sea-weeds supplied soda, pyrites supplied sulphuric acid, and the ground supplied coal to heat the kiln to the wished-for temperature.Cyrus Harding thus soon had everything ready for setting to work."
"最难制造的工具就是制玻璃的管子，这种铁管长约五、六英尺，一端用来蘸取熔化状态的材料。不过，潘克洛夫将一条又长又薄的铁片卷成了枪筒形，这样就做成了一根可以马上使用的管子了。","The tool, the manufacture of which presented the most difficulty, was the pipe of the glass-maker, an iron tube, five or six feet long, which collects on one end the material in a state of fusion.But by means of a long, thin piece of iron rolled up like the barrel of a gun, Pencroft succeeded in making a tube soon ready for use."
"3月28号这天，他们加热了这根管子。他们将100份沙子、35份白垩、40份硫酸钠及两、三份煤屑掺好后放在了钳锅里。当陶土炉子里的高温将原料加热熔化为液体,更确切地说是胶状物的时候，赛勒斯·哈丁先用吹管蘸了一些，然后把吹管在预先放置的金属板上滚来滚去，好让它的形状更适合吹制玻璃，接着他把吹管递给了赫伯特，叫他吹另一端。","On the 28th of March the tube was heated.A hundred parts of sand, thirty-five of chalk, forty of sulphate of soda, mixed with two or three parts of powdered coal, composed the substance, which was placed in crucibles.When the high temperature of the oven had reduced it to a liquid, or rather a pasty state, Cyrus Harding collected with the tube a quantity of the paste: he turned it about on a metal plate, previously arranged, so as to give it a form suitable for blowing, then he passed the tube to Herbert, telling him to blow at the other extremity."
"赫伯特鼓起两颊，使劲往管子里吹，同时认真地旋转吹管，玻璃就这样被吹得膨胀起来了。他们又在刚制成的玻璃物上涂了层同样的胶状物，很快就制成了直径达一英尺的玻璃球。然后，哈丁把赫伯特手里的吹管拿过来，不停地来回摆动，这个柔顺的玻璃球就被拉长了，变成了圆柱形。","And Herbert, swelling out his cheeks, blew so much and so well into the tube-taking care to twirl it round at the same time—that his breath dilated the glassy mass.Other quantities of the substance in a state of fusion were added to the first, and in a short time the result was a bubble which measured a foot in diameter.Harding then took the tube out of Herbert’s hands, and, giving it a pendulous motion, he ended by lengthening the malleable bubble so as to give it a cylindroconic shape."
"吹的工序完成后，将锋利的铁片放在冷水里浸湿，就能轻易地去掉两头的半圆形帽子，这样就做成了一个玻璃圆筒。他们还用同样的方法将圆筒直着割开，再经过一次加热使玻璃软化，然后把它平铺在板子上，用木滚子碾开。","The blowing operation had given a cylinder of glass terminated by two hemispheric caps, which were easily detached by means of a sharp iron dipped in cold water; then, by the same proceeding, this cylinder was cut lengthways, and after having been rendered malleable by a second heating, it was extended on a plate and spread out with a wooden roller."
"第一块玻璃就这样做好了，他们只需要将这个方法重复50次就能得到50块玻璃。花岗石宫的窗户很快就装上了玻璃，虽然它们也许不太纯净，但还是足够透明了。","The first pane was thus manufactured, and they had only to perform this operation fifty times to have fifty panes.The windows at Granite House were soon furnished with panes; not very white, perhaps, but still sufficiently transparent."
"至于做瓶子和平底无脚酒杯，那就更不是问题了。当这些东西从吹管的末端成型的时候，他们都非常得意。潘克洛夫请求让他“吹”一次，对他来说这是很有趣的事情，不过他吹得太用力了，最后出来的东西都奇形怪状，可他自己非常欣赏。","As to bottles and tumblers, that was only play.They were satisfied with them, besides, just as they came from the end of the tube.Pencroft had asked to be allowed to “blow” in his turn, and it was great fun for him; but he blew so hard that his productions took the most ridiculous shapes, which he admired immensely."
"一天，赛勒斯·哈丁和赫伯特出去打猎，进入了慈悲河左岸的远西森林，少年和往常一样问了无数个问题，而工程师则热心地一一予以回答。现在，哈丁不是猎人，另一方面，赫伯特谈论的尽是化学和物理学，于是许多袋鼠、水豚和刺鼠虽然来到射程之内，但逃过了少年的枪口，结果一天的时间都要过去了，两人却可能进行了一次无用的远足，这时赫伯特停下来，发出喜悦的叫声，喊道：","Cyrus Harding and Herbert, while hunting one day, had entered the forest of the Far West, on the left bank of the Mercy, and, as usual, the lad was asking a thousand questions of the engineer, who answered them heartily.Now, as Harding was not a sportsman, and as, on the other side, Herbert was talking chemistry and natural philosophy, numbers of kangaroos, capybaras, and agouties came within range, which, however, escaped the lad’s gun; the consequence was that the day was already advanced, and the two hunters were in danger of having made a useless excursion, when Herbert, stopping, and uttering a cry of joy, exclaimed,—"
"“噢，哈丁上尉，你看见那棵树了吗？”他指着一棵灌木，而不是一棵树，因为它只有一根树茎，外面包着一层鳞状树皮，上面长着少许平行脉的叶子。","“Oh, Captain Harding, do you see that tree?” and he pointed to a shrub, rather than a tree, for it was composed of a single stem, covered with a scaly bark, which bore leaves streaked with little parallel veins."
"“这棵树长得很像小棕榈树，它叫什么名字？”哈丁问道。","“And what is this tree which resembles a little palm?” asked Harding."
"“它叫‘凤尾松’，在我们的《博物学大辞典》里有一张它的照片！”赫伯特说。","“It is a ‘cycas revoluta,’ of which I have a picture in our dictionary of Natural History!” said Herbert."
"“可是我没看见上面有果实啊！”他的同伴说。","“But I can’t see any fruit on this shrub!” observed his companion."
"“的确没有，上尉，”赫伯特回答说，“不过它的树茎里有一种粉末，是大自然都给我们准备好的。”","“No, captain,” replied Herbert; “but its stem contains a flour with which nature has provided us all ready ground.”"
"“那它就是面包树了？”","“It is, then, the bread-tree?”"
"“对，面包树。”","“Yes, the bread-tree.”"
"“太好了，孩子，”工程师说，“这个发现太有价值了，因为我们的麦子还没有成熟，我希望你没有弄错啊！”","“Well, my boy,” replied the engineer, “this is a valuable discovery, since our wheat harvest is not yet ripe; I hope that you are not mistaken!”"
"赫伯特确实没有弄错，他把一棵凤尾松的树干折断，里面是由腺状组织构成，藏着许多粉状木髓，木状纤维从中穿过，同样由粉末构成的同心圆年轮则将它们分隔开来。这种淀粉里混杂了一种气味难闻的粘液，不过可以很容易地被挤压掉。这种细胞质的东西是上等面粉，营养极其丰富，以前日本法律是禁止它出口的。","Herbert was not mistaken: he broke the stem of a cycas, which was composed of a glandulous tissue, containing a quantity of floury pith, traversed with woody fiber, separated by rings of the same substance, arranged concentrically.With this fecula was mingled a mucilaginous juice of disagreeable flavor, but which it would be easy to get rid of by pressure.This cellular substance was regular flour of a superior quality, extremely nourishing; its exportation was formerly forbidden by the Japanese laws."
"赛勒斯·哈丁和赫伯特查看完远西森林里生长凤尾松的那块地方，并做了标记，然后回到花岗石宫，向大家宣布了他们的发现。","Cyrus Harding and Herbert, after having examined that part of the Far West where the cycas grew, took their bearings, and returned to Granite House, where they made known their discovery."
"第二天居民们出去采集了一番，回来就给花岗石宫添了足够使用的凤尾松树茎。工程师做了一台压榨机，用来清除淀粉中混杂的粘液，然后就得到了大量的面粉，很快纳布就用面粉做成了布丁和蛋糕。这还不是真正小麦制成的面包，不过已经差不多了。","The next day the settlers went to collect some, and returned to Granite House with an ample supply of cycas stems.The engineer constructed a press, with which to extract the mucilaginous juice mingled with the fecula, and he obtained a large quantity of flour, which Neb soon transformed into cakes and puddings.This was not quite real wheaten bread, but it was very like it."
"现在，畜栏里的野驴、山羊、绵羊每天也能为居民们提供所需的鲜奶了。推车，确切地说已经被一辆轻型兽力车代替，经常驶去畜栏那里。当轮到潘克洛夫去的时候，他都会带上贾普，让他赶车，贾普挥舞着鞭子，像以往一样表现着自己的智慧。","Now, too, the onager, the goats, and the sheep in the corral furnished daily the milk necessary to the colony.The cart, or rather a sort of light carriole which had replaced it, made frequent journeys to the corral, and when it was Pencroft’s turn to go he took Jup, and let him drive, and Jup, cracking his whip, acquitted himself with his customary intelligence."
"不论是花岗石宫还是畜栏，一切都欣欣向荣，除了远离家乡之外，居民们已经没有什么可抱怨了。他们都已经非常适应这种生活，也很习惯这个岛屿，若是让他们离开这片熟悉的土地，还真不太舍得。","Everything prospered, as well in the corral as in Granite House, and certainly the settlers, if it had not been that they were so far from their native land, had no reason to complain.They were so well suited to this life, and were, besides, so accustomed to the island, that they could not have left its hospitable soil without regret!"
"不过，他们对祖国的热爱却已根植在心中，如果有船突然出现在岛屿的视线范围中，他们就会发出信号吸引船员的注意，然后离开这座岛。","And yet so deeply is the love of his country implanted in the heart of man, that if a ship had unexpectedly come in sight of the island, the colonists would have made signals, would have attracted her attention, and would have departed!"
"4月1号是星期天，也是复活节，哈丁和同伴们通过休息和祷告过节。这一天天气很好，可能像北半球十月份的天气。","It was the 1st of April, a Sunday, Easter Day, which Harding and his companions sanctified by rest and prayer.The day was fine, such as an October day in the Northern Hemisphere might be."
"傍晚吃过晚饭后，大伙都坐在眺望岗边缘的平台上，注视着逐渐被黑暗吞噬的地平线。纳布给大家端来了几杯接骨木种子的饮料，用这个代替咖啡喝。他们谈起了这座荒岛以及它在太平洋上孤立的地理位置，这引得吉丁·史佩莱问道：","All, towards the evening after dinner, were seated under the veranda on the edge of Prospect Heights, and they were watching the darkness creeping up from the horizon.Some cups of the infusion of elder-berries, which took the place of coffee, had been served by Neb.They were speaking of the island and of its isolated situation in the Pacific, which led Gideon Spilett to say,—"
"“亲爱的赛勒斯，自从你在箱子里找到六分仪后，你有没有重新测定这座岛屿的位置？”","“My dear Cyrus, have you ever, since you possessed the sextant found in the case, again taken the position of our island?”"
"“没有。”工程师回答说。","“No,” replied the engineer."
"“不过也许用这个仪器量更好，它可比你以前用的那个东西好多了。”","“But it would perhaps be a good thing to do it with this instrument, which is more perfect than that which you before used.”"
"“那有什么用？”潘克洛夫问，“荒岛不还是在那儿呆着吗！”","“What is the good?” said Pencroft.“The island is quite comfortable where it is!”"
"“那谁能知道呢，”记者回答说，“也许我们与有人居住的陆地的距离比我们想象中的要近得多呢？这谁又知道？”","“Well, who knows,” returned the reporter, “who knows but that we may be much nearer inhabited land than we think?”"
"“明天我们就能知道了，”赛勒斯回答说，“要不是因为事情太多抽不出时间，我们早就能知道了。”","“We shall know to-morrow,” replied Cyrus Harding, “and if it had not been for the occupations which left me no leisure, we should have known it already.”"
"“太好了！”潘克洛夫说，“上尉可是顶棒的测量家，他肯定不会错，除非荒岛自己从它的位置上移动了，不然它肯定还在上次标记的地方。”","“Good!” said Pencroft.“The captain is too good an observer to be mistaken, and, if it has not moved from its place, the island is just where he put it.”"
"“我们拭目以待吧。”","“We shall see.”"
"因此，第二天，工程师用六分仪进行了必要的测量，从而证实他已经得知的位置，下面就是他测量后得到的结果。第一次测量使他得到了林肯岛的位置：","On the next day, therefore, by means of the sextant, the engineer made the necessary observations to verify the position which he had already obtained, and this was the result of his operation.His first observation had given him the situation of Lincoln Island,—"
"西经150度至157度；","In west longitude: from 150 to 155;"
"南纬30度至35度。","In south latitude: from 30 to 35"
"第二次测量的结果就精确了：","The second gave exactly:"
"西经150度30分；","In longitude: 150 30’"
"南纬34度57分。","In south latitude: 34 57’"
"虽然上次使用的仪器不够完备，但赛勒斯·哈丁精湛的测量技术使得最后的测量误差不超过5度。","So then, notwithstanding the imperfection of his apparatus, Cyrus Harding had operated with so much skill that his error did not exceed five degrees."
"“现在，”吉丁·史佩莱说，“既然我们有了地图和六分仪，亲爱的赛勒斯，就让我们看看林肯岛在太平洋的精确位置吧。”","“Now,” said Gideon Spilett, “since we possess an atlas as well as a sextant, let us see, my dear Cyrus, the exact position which Lincoln Island occupies in the Pacific.”"
"赫伯特拿来地图，将太平洋那部分展开，工程师手里则拿着指南针，准备进行定位。","Herbert fetched the atlas, and the map of the Pacific was opened, and the engineer, compass in hand, prepared to determine their position."
"突然，指南针停住不动了，他大声喊道：","Suddenly the compasses stopped, and he exclaimed,"
"“太平洋的这个地方早就有一个岛了！”","“But an island exists in this part of the Pacific already!”"
"“有一个岛？”潘克洛夫大声问。","“An island?” cried Pencroft."
"“是达抱岛。”","“Tabor Island.”"
"“是重要的岛吗？”","“An important island?”"
"“不，是太平洋里的一座荒岛，可能至今都没有人去过。”","“No, an islet lost in the Pacific, and which perhaps has never been visited.”"
"“那我们就去吧。”潘克洛夫说。","“Well, we will visit it,” said Pencroft."
"“我们？”","“We?”"
"“是的，上尉。我们可以造一艘甲板船，我来负责驾驶。我们离这个达抱岛有多远？”","“Yes, captain.We will build a decked boat, and I will undertake to steer her.At what distance are we from this Tabor Island?”"
"“它在东北方向约150英里处。”哈丁回答说。","“About a hundred and fifty miles to the northeast,” replied Harding."
"“150英里！能有多远？”潘克洛夫说，“只要顺风，我们在48小时内就能看到它！”","“A hundred and fifty miles!And what’s that?” returned Pencroft.“In forty-eight hours, with a good wind, we should sight it!”"
"得到这样的回应之后，大伙决定赶紧造一艘船，等到将近十月份天气转好的时候启程。","And, on this reply, it was decided that a vessel should be constructed in time to be launched towards the month of next October, on the return of the fine season."
"第十章","Chapter 10"
"只要潘克洛夫头脑中有个计划，他就心神不宁，直到计划被执行。现在他想去达抱岛，不过一艘大小合适的船对于这次航行是必需的，所以他决心造一艘。","When Pencroft had once got a plan in his head, he had no peace till it was executed.Now he wished to visit Tabor Island, and as a boat of a certain size was necessary for this voyage, he determined to build one."
"他应该用哪种木材呢？榆树还是枞树？这两种木材岛上都长了很多。不过他们最终决定采用枞树，这样比较省事，而且这种树的防水功能也不比榆树差。","What wood should he employ?Elm or fir, both of which abounded in the island?They decided for the fir, as being easy to work, but which stands water as well as the elm."
"细节都已经商定好了，由于还有六个月的时间天气才会转好，所以大家决定只留赛勒斯·哈丁和潘克洛夫单独造船。吉丁·史佩莱和赫伯特则继续打猎，纳布和他的助理贾普仍要留下来干交代给他们的家务活。","These details settled, it was agreed that since the fine season would not return before six months, Cyrus Harding and Pencroft should work alone at the boat.Gideon Spilett and Herbert were to continue to hunt, and neither Neb nor Master Jup, his assistant, were to leave the domestic duties which had devolved upon them."
"树木很快就选好了，他们把树砍下来，去掉树枝，然后锯成板子，就像锯木工人能做出来的一样。一个星期过后，“石窟”和峭壁之间一块凹陷的地方上就准备好了一个造船所，还有一条长达35英尺的龙骨躺在沙子上，它的末端装上了船尾材，而前端则放上了船首材。","Directly the trees were chosen, they were felled, stripped of their branches, and sawn into planks as well as sawyers would have been able to do it.A week after, in the recess between the Chimneys and the cliff, a dockyard was prepared, and a keel five-and-thirty feet long, furnished with a stern-post at the stern and a stem at the bows, lay along the sand."
"赛勒斯·哈丁在进行这项新任务的时候，并没有盲目行事。他对造船的了解几乎不比其他事情差，况且他还先在纸上绘制好了船的模型。而且，他还有潘克洛夫的得力协助。潘克洛夫在布鲁克林的造船所干过好几年，有造船的实践经验。经过仔细估算以及深思熟虑之后，他们才把木板加在了龙骨上。","Cyrus Harding was not working in the dark at this new trade.He knew as much about ship-building as about nearly everything else, and he had at first drawn the model of his ship on paper.Besides, he was ably seconded by Pencroft, who, having worked for several years in a dockyard in Brooklyn, knew the practical part of the trade.It was not until after careful calculation and deep thought that the timbers were laid on the keel."
"潘克洛夫急切地想赶紧开始他新的大业，这种心情可以理解，他一分钟也不愿意离开他的工作。","Pencroft, as may be believed, was all eagerness to carry out his new enterprise, and would not leave his work for an instant."
"有一件事竟然令他离开了造船所，这可是相当大的面子，不过只有一天而已。就是4月15日第二次麦收的那天。这次麦收和上次一样成功，收到的麦子和预期的数量一样。","A single thing had the honor of drawing him, but for one day only, from his dockyard.This was the second wheat-harvest, which was gathered in on the 15th of April.It was as much a success as the first, and yielded the number of grains which had been predicted."
"“五蒲式耳，上尉。”潘克洛夫说，他已经认真地量过了他的宝贝。","“Five bushels, captain,” said Pencroft, alter having scrupulously measured his treasure."
"“五蒲式耳，”工程师回应道，“每蒲式耳有13万粒，那我们总共就有65万粒了。”","“Five bushels,” replied the engineer; “and a hundred and thirty thousand grains a bushel will make six hundred and fifty thousand grains.”"
"“那我们这次可以全部种上，”水手说，“只要留一点下来就行。”","“Well, we will sow them all this time,” said the sailor, “except a little in reserve.”"
"“对，潘克洛夫，如果下一次也能按这个比例产出，那我们就能得到四千蒲式耳了。”","“Yes, Pencroft, and if the next crop gives a proportionate yield, we shall have four thousand bushels.”"
"“那到时候我们能吃面包吗？”","“And shall we eat bread?”"
"“我们能吃上面包。”","“We shall eat bread.”"
"“不过我们得先弄台磨粉机。”","“But we must have a mill."
"“我们可以自己造一台。”","“We will make one.”"
"第三块麦田比前两块大多了，小心翼翼地把地辟好之后，他们就撒上了这些宝贵的种子。一切都完成后，潘克洛夫就回到原来的工作中。","The third corn-field was very much larger than the two first, and the soil, prepared with extreme care, received the precious seed.That done, Pencroft returned to his work."
"也就是在这段时间，史佩莱和赫伯特在周围打猎，他们冒险深入到远西森林的未知区域，枪里面都装好了子弹，以防不测。这是一片长满参天大树的广阔丛林，树木都挤在一起，就好像迫切需要空间一样。要在如此茂密的树林里探索是极其困难的，记者没带袖珍指南针绝不冒险，因为这里的树叶都很浓密，几乎透不进阳光，顺着原路返回也很困难。在这样没有足够空间移动的地方，当然就更难见到猎物了，不过，四月下半月的时候，他们还是打着了两三只大个的草食动物。居民们在湖的北面就已经见过这种动物了，它们就是考拉熊，这些动物蠢到极点，藏身在如此茂密的枝叶之中，竟会被人射死。居民们把熊皮带回了花岗石宫，用硫酸经过一种鞣制工序后，熊皮就可以使用了。","During this time Spilett and Herbert hunted in the neighborhood, and they ventured deep into the still unknown parts of the Far West, their guns loaded with ball, ready for any dangerous emergency.It was a vast thicket of magnificent trees, crowded together as if pressed for room.The exploration of these dense masses of wood was difficult in the extreme, and the reporter never ventured there without the pocket-compass, for the sun scarcely pierced through the thick foliage and it would have been very difficult for them to retrace their way.It naturally happened that game was more rare in those situations where there was hardly sufficient room to move; two or three large herbivorous animals were however killed during the last fortnight of April.These were koalas, specimens of which the settlers had already seen to the north of the lake, and which stupidly allowed themselves to be killed among the thick branches of the trees in which they took refuge.Their skins were brought back to Granite House, and there, by the help of sulphuric acid, they were subjected to a sort of tanning process which rendered them capable of being used."
"4月30日这天，两位神枪手又一次深入远西森林，记者走在赫伯特前面几步，他们来到了一块空地上，这里的树木比较稀疏，有几缕阳光透进来。有几株茎杆挺直浑圆、长满树枝的植物，开出了一团团像葡萄似的花朵，并且结了很小的果实，散发着香气，吉丁·史佩莱起初闻到后很惊讶。他折断了一两根茎杆，拿给少年，向他说道：","On the 30th of April, the two sportsmen were in the depth of the Far West, when the reporter, preceding Herbert a few paces, arrived in a sort of clearing, into which the trees more sparsely scattered had permitted a few rays to penetrate.Gideon Spilett was at first surprised at the odor which exhaled from certain plants with straight stalks, round and branchy, bearing grape-like clusters of flowers and very small berries.The reporter broke off one or two of these stalks and returned to the lad, to whom he said,—"
"“这可能是什么，赫伯特？”","“What can this be, Herbert?”"
"“史佩莱先生，”赫伯特说，“他是准能让潘克洛夫一辈子感激你的宝贝。”","“Well, Mr. Spilett,” said Herbert, “this is a treasure which will secure you Pencroft’s gratitude forever.”"
"“难道是烟草？”","“Is it tobacco?”"
"“是的，虽然它可能不是最好的烟，但还是烟草！”","“Yes, and though it may not be of the first quality, it is none the less tobacco!”"
"“啊，好潘克洛夫！他还不得乐死啊！不过他可不能全都拿走，他得分出我们的那份。”","“Oh, good old Pencroft!Won’t he be pleased!But we must not let him smoke it all, he must give us our share.”"
"“啊！我有一个主意，史佩莱先生，”赫伯特说，“先不要告诉潘克洛夫，我们可以准备好烟草，等到一个吉日把烟斗装得满满的再给他！”","“Ah! an idea occurs to me, Mr, Spilett,” replied Herbert.“Don’t let us say anything to Pencroft yet; we will prepare these leaves, and one fine day we will present him with a pipe already filled!”"
"“好，赫伯特，到那天，我们可敬的伙伴在世上再也不想要什么了。”","“All right, Herbert, and on that day our worthy companion will have nothing left to wish for in this world.”"
"记者和少年装了大量的这种珍贵植物，并回到了花岗石宫，他们谨慎地偷偷溜进去，就好像潘克洛夫是最警觉和最严厉的海关官员似的。","The reporter and the lad secured a good store of the precious plant, and then returned to Granite House, where they smuggled it in with as much precaution as if Pencroft had been the most vigilant and severe of custom-house officers."
"他们私下把这件事告诉了赛勒斯·哈丁和纳布，而水手一直都毫无怀疑，事实上，这段时间有些漫长，因为他们要把小烟叶晒干、切细，然后把它们放在滚烫的石头上烤制。这需要两个月的时间，不过一切都在潘克洛夫不知情的情况下顺利进行，因为他忙于造船，只有在休息时间才会回到花岗石宫。","Cyrus Harding and Neb were taken into confidence, and the sailor suspected nothing during the whole time, necessarily somewhat long, which was required in order to dry the small leaves, chop them up, and subject them to a certain torrefaction on hot stones.This took two months; but all these manipulations were successfully carried on unknown to Pencroft, for, occupied with the construction of his boat, he only returned to Granite House at the hour of rest."
"有好几天，他们都看到一只巨大的动物在林肯岛附近两三英里的水里游来游去。这是一只巨鲸，明显属于南半球的族类，称为“好望角鲸鱼”。","For some days they had observed an enormous animal two or three miles out in the open sea swimming around Lincoln Island.This was a whale of the largest size, which apparently belonged to the southern species, called the “Cape Whale.”"
"“要是我们能抓到它，是多么幸运的事啊！”水手喊道，“啊，要是有一艘合适的船和一副好鱼叉，我就会下‘追捕令’了，抓它再麻烦也值得。”","“What a lucky chance it would be if we could capture it!” cried the sailor.“Ah! if we only had a proper boat and a good harpoon, I would say ‘After the beast,’ for he would be well worth the trouble of catching!”"
"“好吧，潘克洛夫，”哈丁说，“我还挺想看看你怎么用鱼叉。肯定会很有意思。”","“Well, Pencroft,” observed Harding, “I should much like to watch you handling a harpoon.It would be very interesting.”"
"“我有点惊讶，”记者说道，“在这个纬度相对较高的地方看见鲸鱼。”","“I am astonished,” said the reporter, “to see a whale in this comparatively high latitude.”"
"“怎么会这么说，史佩莱先生？”赫伯特回答说，“我们现在所处的位置正是英国和美国捕鲸者所说的太平洋中的鲸鱼田，就在这里，新西兰和南美中间的地带是南半球鲸鱼数量最多的地方。”","“Why so, Mr. Spilett?” replied Herbert.“We are exactly in that part of the Pacific which English and American whalemen call the whale field, and it is here, between New Zealand and South America, that the whales of the Southern Hemisphere are met with in the greatest numbers.”"
"潘克洛夫遗憾地叹了一口气，就回去工作了，每个水手天生就是渔夫，如果说捕鱼的乐趣与鱼的大小正好成正比，那么捕鲸员看到鲸鱼的那种心情就可想而知了。倘若这仅仅是为了乐趣也就算了！不过他们不禁想到这样一个宝贝对开拓地是多么有价值，因为鲸油、鲸肉和骨头都有很多用途。","And Pencroft returned to his work, not without uttering a sigh of regret, for every sailor is a born fisherman, and if the pleasure of fishing is in exact proportion to the size of the animal, one can judge how a whaler feels in sight of a whale.And if this had only been for pleasure!But they could not help feeling how valuable such a prize would have been to the colony, for the oil, fat, and bones would have been put to many uses."
"这只鲸鱼现在似乎不想离开岛屿周围的这片水域。因此，当赫伯特和吉丁·史佩莱不打猎或者纳布不做饭的时候，他们就会一直呆在花岗石宫的窗户边或在眺望岗上，绝不会离开望远镜，观察鲸鱼的一举一动。鲸鱼深入到联合湾后，就从鄂角游到爪角，并激起了一片急浪，大而有力的尾巴支撑着它的身子，并推着它向前游，其速度几乎达到了每小时12海里。有时候鲸鱼会游到离岛屿很近的地方，所以一眼就能看清楚。这是一只南方鲸鱼，它全身都是黑的，头则比北方鲸鱼扁一些。","Now it happened that this whale appeared to have no wish to leave the waters of the island.Therefore, whether from the windows of Granite House, or from Prospect Heights, Herbert and Gideon Spilett, when they were not hunting, or Neb, unless presiding over his fires, never left the telescope, but watched all the animal’s movements.The cetacean, having entered far into Union Bay, made rapid furrows across it from Mandible Cape to Claw Cape, propelled by its enormously powerful flukes, on which it supported itself, and making its way through the water at the rate little short of twelve knots an hour.Sometimes also it approached so near to the island that it could be clearly distinguished.It was the southern whale, which is completely black, the head being more depressed than that of the northern whale."
"他们还能看到鲸鱼的气孔往外喷出了很高的水汽，或者是水，奇怪的是博物学家和捕鲸员在这一点上没有达成共识。喷出来的到底是水汽还是水呢？一般人们都认为是水汽，突然遇到冷空气的水汽重新凝结，成水落下来了。","They could also see it throwing up from its air-holes to a great height a cloud of vapor, or of water, for, strange as it may appear, naturalists and whalers are not agreed on this subject.Is it air or is it water which is thus driven out?It is generally admitted to be vapor, which, condensing suddenly by contact with the cold air, falls again as rain."
"不过，这只哺乳动物的出现使得开拓者们都没心思想别的了。鲸鱼尤其烦扰了潘克洛夫，他工作的时候都只想着这只鲸鱼了。最后他渴望得到它，就像一个得不到想要的东西的孩子一样。晚上睡觉时他说着这事情，如果他有办法攻击它，或者单桅帆船已经适合出海，他肯定会毫不犹豫地出发捕鱼。","However, the presence of this mammifer preoccupied the colonists.It irritated Pencroft especially, as he could think of nothing else while at work.He ended by longing for it, like a child for a thing which it has been denied.At night he talked about it in his sleep, and certainly if he had had the means of attacking it, if the sloop had been in a fit state to put to sea, he would not have hesitated to set out in pursuit."
"可是开拓者们自己办不到的事，偶然的机遇却让他们心想事成了。5月3号这天，站在厨房窗户边的纳布发出喊声，说那只鲸鱼在岛屿的海滩上搁浅了。","But what the colonists could not do for themselves chance did for them, and on the 3rd of May shouts from Neb, who had stationed himself at the kitchen window, announced that the whale was stranded on the beach of the island."
"正要去打猎的赫伯特和史佩莱放下了手里的枪，潘克洛夫扔下了斧头，哈丁和纳布跟同伴们一起冲向鲸鱼搁浅的地方。","Herbert and Gideon Spilett, who were just about to set out hunting, left their guns, Pencroft threw down his ax, and Harding and Neb joining their companions, all rushed towards the scene of action."
"那里就是离花岗石宫三英里远的遗物角沙滩，鲸鱼在涨潮的时候搁浅了。因此，它可能很难逃离，不过最好抓紧时间，必要的话得切断它的退路。他们手里拿着鹤嘴锄和铁头杆，经过慈悲河桥，跑下河的右岸，并沿着沙滩一只向前，不到20分钟他们就来到了这个巨大的动物旁边，成群的海鸟已在鲸鱼的上空盘旋。","The stranding had taken place on the beach of Flotsam Point, three miles from Granite House, and at high tide.It was therefore probable that the cetacean would not be able to extricate itself easily; at any rate it was best to hasten, so as to cut off its retreat if necessary.They ran with pick-axes and iron-tipped poles in their hands, passed over the Mercy bridge, descended the right bank of the river, along the beach, and in less than twenty minutes the settlers were close to the enormous animal, above which flocks of birds already hovered."
"“好大的怪物啊！”纳布喊道。","“What a monster!” cried Neb."
"纳布这么喊是很自然的，因为这头南方鲸鱼有80英尺长，在族类中算是巨大的，重量也应该不低于15万磅！","And the exclamation was natural, for it was a southern whale, eighty feet long, a giant of the species, probably not weighing less than a hundred and fifty thousand pounds!"
"此时此刻，这只搁浅的鲸鱼一动不动，也没有趁仍在涨潮的时候挣扎回水里去。","In the meanwhile, the monster thus stranded did not move, nor attempt by struggling to regain the water while the tide was still high."
"鲸鱼已经死了，它的左侧刺入了一根鱼叉。","It was dead, and a harpoon was sticking out of its left side."
"“这么说来，这一带有捕鲸船吧？”吉丁·史佩莱直接问道。","“There are whalers in these quarters, then?” said Gideon Spilett directly."
"“啊，史佩莱先生，这证明不了什么呀！”潘克洛夫回应道，“据说鲸鱼能身上带着鱼叉游上千英里，这只鲸鱼甚至可能在大西洋北部被插到，然后死在太平洋南部，这不足为奇。”","“Oh, Mr. Spilett, that doesn’t prove anything!” replied Pencroft.“Whales have been known to go thousands of miles with a harpoon in the side, and this one might even have been struck in the north of the Atlantic and come to die in the south of the Pacific, and it would be nothing astonishing.”"
"潘克洛夫拔出了鲸鱼身上的鱼叉，念出了上面刻的字：","Pencroft, having torn the harpoon from the animal’s side, read this inscription on it:"
"玛丽亚·斯特拉，葡萄园","MARIA STELLA, VINEYARD"
"“是一艘从葡萄园来的船！是从我家乡来的船！”他叫起来。“玛丽亚·斯特拉！一艘很棒的捕鲸船，没错，我对它很熟悉！啊，朋友们，从葡萄园来的船，从葡萄园来的捕鲸船！”","“A vessel from the Vineyard!A ship from my country!” he cried.“The ‘Maria Stella!’ A fine whaler, ‘pon my word; I know her well!Oh, my friends, a vessel from the Vineyard!—a whaler from the Vineyard!”"
"水手一边挥舞着鱼叉，一边情绪激动地重复着他深爱的名字——故乡的名字。","And the sailor brandishing the harpoon, repeated, not without emotion, the name which he loved so well—the name of his birthplace."
"不过，“玛丽亚·斯特拉”应该不会来这里捡回它击中的鲸鱼，所以他们决定趁着鲸鱼还没开始腐烂把它分解。那些飞鸟盯着这个丰富的食物已经好几天了，它们决定占有鲸鱼，而且片刻也不耽误，因此大家不得不对它们连续开枪，把它们赶走。","But as it could not be expected that the “Maria Stella” would come to reclaim the animal harpooned by her, they resolved to begin cutting it up before decomposition should commence.The birds, who had watched this rich prey for several days, had determined to take possession of it without further delay, and it was necessary to drive them off by firing at them repeatedly."
"这是一只母鲸，居民们从它身上提取了大量鲸奶，根据博物学家德芬巴赫的观点，它可以代替牛奶，的确，不论是口感、色泽，还是浓度，它和牛奶都没什么区别。","The whale was a female, and a large quantity of milk was taken from it, which, according to the opinion of the naturalist Duffenbach, might pass for cow’s milk, and, indeed, it differs from it neither in taste, color, nor density."
"潘克洛夫以前曾经在捕鲸船上工作过，他能有条不紊地指导大家切肉，这项足以令人厌恶的工作花了三天时间，不过居民们并没有畏缩，就连吉丁·史佩莱也包括在内，正如水手所说，他最后会成为“真正的遇难英雄”。","Pencroft had formerly served on board a whaling-ship, and he could methodically direct the operation of cutting up, a sufficiently disagreeable operation lasting three days, but from which the settlers did not flinch, not even Gideon Spilett, who, as the sailor said, would end by making a “real good castaway.”"
"他们把鲸油切成了2.5英寸厚的方块，接着又将它们分成了许多小片，每片重约1000英磅，然后他们就在原地用大陶罐熬鲸油，因为他们不想把花岗石宫附近弄得都是怪味，在熬的过程中鲸油几乎减少了三分之一的重量。","The blubber, cut in parallel slices of two feet and a half in thickness, then divided into pieces which might weigh about a thousand pounds each, was melted down in large earthen pots brought to the spot, for they did not wish to taint the environs of Granite House, and in this fusion it lost nearly a third of its weight."
"不过鲸油还是很多，光是鲸鱼的舌头就熬出了六千英磅油，下唇也有四千英镑。此时他们有了鲸鱼的脂肪，它能在很长一段时间保证硬脂和甘油的供应，另外他们还有鲸鱼骨头，虽然在花岗石宫用不上雨伞和支架，但它们肯定会有用途的。鲸鱼的上嘴唇两边有八百块很有弹性的角状片，它们是一种纤维组织，边缘就像大梳子，而上面的梳齿长达六英尺，用来咬住上千只作为食物的小动物，如小鱼和软体动物。","But there was an immense quantity of it; the tongue alone yielded six thousand pounds of oil, and the lower lip four thousand.Then, besides the fat, which would insure for a long time a store of stearine and glycerine, there were still the bones, for which a use could doubtless be found, although there were neither umbrellas nor stays used at Granite House.The upper part of the mouth of the cetacean was, indeed, provided on both sides with eight hundred horny blades, very elastic, of a fibrous texture, and fringed at the edge like great combs, at which the teeth, six feet long, served to retain the thousands of animalculae, little fish, and molluscs, on which the whale fed."
"工作完成以后，大家都感到很满意。剩下的鲸鱼尸体就留给那群飞鸟了，它们很快就会使每片痕迹消失，然后花岗石宫的居民们又重新开始他们的日常工作。","The operation finished, to the great satisfaction of the operators, the remains of the animal were left to the birds, who would soon make every vestige of it disappear, and their usual daily occupations were resumed by the inmates of Granite House."
"不过哈丁在回造船所之前，想做一些器械，这极大地激发了同伴们的好奇心。他选取了12块鲸鱼骨头，将它们切成六个大小一样的部分，并削尖了两端。","However, before returning to the dockyard, Cyrus Harding conceived the idea of fabricating certain machines, which greatly excited the curiosity of his companions.He took a dozen of the whale’s bones, cut them into six equal parts, and sharpened their ends."
"“这个小东西不是我发明的，俄属美洲阿留申群岛的猎人经常使用这东西。朋友们，你们看这些骨头，等到结冰的时候，我会把它们弄弯，然后用水浸湿，直到它们完全被冰盖住，这样它们就能保持弯曲的形态，在上面涂完一层油后，我会把它们扔到雪地上。那么，饥饿的野兽吞下一个这样的食饵会怎么样呢？野兽胃里的温度会使冰融化，骨头就会变直，骨尖就会把它刺穿。”","“This machine is not my own invention, and it is frequently employed by the Aleutian hunters in Russian America.You see these bones, my friends; well, when it freezes, I will bend them, and then wet them with water till they are entirely covered with ice, which will keep them bent, and I will strew them on the snow, having previously covered them with fat.Now, what will happen if a hungry animal swallows one of these baits?Why, the heat of his stomach will melt the ice, and the bone, springing straight, will pierce him with its sharp points.”"
"“太厉害了！我只能说这太巧妙了！”潘克洛夫说。","“Well!I do call that ingenious!” said Pencroft."
"“这样还可以省点弹药。”赛勒斯·哈丁也开口说。","“And it will spare the powder and shot,” rejoined Cyrus Harding."
"“这比陷阱厉害多了！”纳布补充说。","“That will be better than traps!” added Neb."
"在此期间，造船的工作依旧进行着，快到月底的时候，铺板的工序已经完成一半了。现在已经能看出船的外形十分美观，航行起来一定不错。","In the meanwhile the boat-building progressed, and towards the end of the month half the planking was completed.It could already be seen that her shape was excellent, and that she would sail well."
"潘克洛夫以无比的热情工作，只有身体强壮的人才能经得住这样的劳苦，他的伙伴们在悄悄地为他准备慰劳品，5月31号这天，他将见到此生最大的惊喜之一。","Pencroft worked with unparalleled ardor, and only a sturdy frame could have borne such fatigue; but his companions were preparing in secret a reward for his labors, and on the 31st of May he was to meet with one of the greatest joys of his life."
"那天吃过晚饭，潘克洛夫正要离开饭桌，觉得有一只手放在了他的肩膀上。","On that day, after dinner, just as he was about to leave the table, Pencroft felt a hand on his shoulder."
"原来是吉丁·史佩莱，他说：","It was the hand of Gideon Spilett, who said,—"
"“等一下，潘克洛夫，你别偷偷地溜走啊！你忘了你的餐后甜点了。”","“One moment, Master Pencroft, you mustn’t sneak off like that!You’ve forgotten your dessert.”"
"“谢谢了，史佩莱先生，”水手说，“我要回去工作了。”","“Thank you, Mr. Spilett,” replied the sailor, “I am going back to my work.”"
"“要不，喝杯咖啡吧，伙计？”","“Well, a cup of coffee, my friend?”"
"“不要了。”","“Nothing more.”"
"“那抽支烟呢？”","“A pipe, then?”"
"潘克洛夫跳起来了，当他看到记者递给他一只装好的烟斗，赫伯特给他送上一块燃烧的木炭时，他那一向温厚的面庞都发白了。","Pencroft jumped up, and his great good-natured face grew pale when he saw the reporter presenting him with a ready-filled pipe, and Herbert with a glowing coal."
"水手努力想说话，但是一个字都说不出来，他抓住烟斗送到嘴里，点上火后就使劲抽了五六口。一缕芬香的青烟很快就升起来了，大家只听到潘克洛夫在烟雾中兴奋地重复道：","The sailor endeavored to speak, but could not get out a word; so, seizing the pipe, he carried it to his lips, then applying the coal, he drew five or six great whiffs.A fragrant blue cloud soon arose, and from its depths a voice was heard repeating excitedly,—"
"“烟！是真烟！”","“Tobacco! real tobacco!”"
"“是的，潘克洛夫，”赛勒斯·哈丁回应说，“而且还是很好的烟呢！”","“Yes, Pencroft,” returned Cyrus Harding, “and very good tobacco too!”"
"“噢，我的上帝，神圣的万物主宰！”水手喊道，“现在我们岛上什么也不缺了。”","“O, divine Providence; sacred Author of all things!” cried the sailor.“Nothing more is now wanting to our island.”"
"接着潘克洛夫继续抽，抽了一口又一口。","And Pencroft smoked, and smoked, and smoked."
"“是谁找到这烟的？”他最终还是问了，“肯定是你吧，赫伯特？”","“And who made this discovery?” he asked at length.“You, Herbert, no doubt?”"
"“不对，潘克洛夫，是史佩莱先生。”","“No, Pencroft, it was Mr. Spilett.”"
"“史佩莱先生！”水手喊道，他抓住记者，然后把他紧紧地搂在胸前，他从未有过这样的感受。","“Mr. Spilett!” exclaimed the sailor, seizing the reporter, and clasping him to his breast with such a squeeze that he had never felt anything like it before."
"“潘克洛夫，”史佩莱终于能有一口气说话了，“你先冷静会儿。你还得谢谢赫伯特，是他认出来了这种植物，还有赛勒斯，是他制作的烟草，还有纳布，他还费尽心思保守我们的秘密。”","“Oh Pencroft,” said Spilett, recovering his breath at last, “a truce for one moment.You must share your gratitude with Herbert, who recognized the plant, with Cyrus, who prepared it, and with Neb, who took a great deal of trouble to keep our secret.”"
"“啊，朋友们，你们真好，总有一天我会报答你们的，”水手说，“我们一生一世都是朋友。”","“Well, my friends, I will repay you some day,” replied the sailor.“Now we are friends for life.”"
"第十一章","Chapter 11"
"六月一到，冬天也随之来临了，这时候相当于北半球的十二月，现在最要紧的任务就是做一些保暖而结实的衣物了。","Winter arrived with the month of June, which is the December of the northern zones, and the great business was the making of warm and solid clothing."
"畜栏里摩弗伦羊的羊毛已经剪下来了，现在他们要把这些珍贵的纺织原料织成像样的东西。","The musmons in the corral had been stripped of their wool, and this precious textile material was now to be transformed into stuff."
"当然，赛勒斯·哈丁手头没有刷毛机、梳毛机、磨光机、绷架、绞丝机和纺织机，没有自动机器来织羊毛，也没有织布机，所以他只能不用纺织和编织，而用更加简便的方法。实际上，他提议利用羊毛纤维在强大压力下会黏在一起的特点，再采用简单的方法制作毛毡。毛毡的制作流程很简单，如果羊毛的弹性下降，就会增加保暖性。因为摩弗伦羊的羊毛都很短，所以做起毛毡来很容易。","Of course Cyrus Harding, having at his disposal neither carders, combers, polishers, stretchers, twisters, mule-jenny, nor self-acting machine to spin the wool, nor loom to weave it, was obliged to proceed in a simpler way, so as to do without spinning and weaving.And indeed he proposed to make use of the property which the filaments of wool possess when subjected to a powerful pressure of mixing together, and of manufacturing by this simple process the material called felt.This felt could then be obtained by a simple operation which, if it diminished the flexibility of the stuff, increased its power of retaining heat in proportion.Now the wool furnished by the musmons was composed of very short hairs, and was in a good condition to be felted."
"工程师得到了伙伴们的协助，潘克洛夫也包括在内，他不得不再次放下造船的活，开始做些初步工作，这道工序的目的是去除渗透在羊毛里的多余脂肪和油质，也就是所说的兽脂。清理工作在盛满水的大桶里完成，水温要保持在70度左右，羊毛浸泡完24个小时后，再用苏打水彻底清洗，然后再用力挤干，就可以加压了，也就是可以做成结实的毛料了。这种东西当然是很粗糙的，要是拿到欧美的工业中心肯定会一文不值，但在林肯岛的市场上它可是受到高度重视。","The engineer, aided by his companions, including Pencroft, who was once more obliged to leave his boat, commenced the preliminary operations, the subject of which was to rid the wool of that fat and oily substance with which it is impregnated, and which is called grease.This cleaning was done in vats filled with water, which was maintained at the temperature of seventy degrees, and in which the wool was soaked for four-and-twenty hours; it was then thoroughly washed in baths of soda, and, when sufficiently dried by pressure, it was in a state to be compressed, that is to say, to produce a solid material, rough, no doubt, and such as would have no value in a manufacturing center of Europe or America, but which would be highly esteemed in the Lincoln Island markets."
"这种毛料一定在很久以前就有人使用过了，事实上，最原始的毛料就是用哈丁现在打算采用的方法生产出来的。在制造压制棉毛的机器时，哈丁的工程师才能有了用武之地，他知道如何巧妙地利用海滩上瀑布的机械动力来推动水力压榨机，而这种动力至今还未被人使用过。","This sort of material must have been known from the most ancient times, and, in fact, the first woolen stuffs were manufactured by the process which Harding was now about to employ.Where Harding’s engineering qualifications now came into play was in the construction of the machine for pressing the wool; for he knew how to turn ingeniously to profit the mechanical force, hitherto unused, which the waterfall on the beach possessed to move a fulling-mill."
"再也没有比这更简单的了。羊毛放到凹槽里后，就会有沉重的木槌交替捶打，这就是需要制作的机器。几个世纪以来，人们一直都在使用这种机器，直到压滚取代了这种设备，以前的那种捶打方法才停止使用，有规律的压滚法则取而代之。","Nothing could be more rudimentary.The wool was placed in troughs, and upon it fell in turns heavy wooden mallets; such was the machine in question, and such it had been for centuries until the time when the mallets were replaced by cylinders of compression, and the material was no longer subjected to beating, but to regular rolling."
"在赛勒斯·哈丁的得力指导下，这个工序做得很成功。羊毛在肥皂水里浸过后，一方面有利于交织、压榨以及使羊毛变柔软，另一方面则可以避免羊毛因捶打而收缩。羊毛从压榨机里出来后就能变成厚毛毡了。羊毛的原料本来就很粗糙，严密地缠结、交织在一起后，毛料既适合做成衣服，也同样能做被褥。当然，这既不是美利诺呢绒、平纹细布、开士米羊毛、棱纹布、缎子、羊驼呢或布料，也不是法兰绒。这是“林肯毡”，林肯岛又拥有了一件工业品。开拓者们现在有暖和的衣服和厚厚的被子，能毫无畏惧地等待1866－1867年冬天的来临了。","The operation, ably directed by Cyrus Harding, was a complete success.The wool, previously impregnated with a solution of soap, intended on the one hand to facilitate the interlacing, the compression, and the softening of the wool, and on the other to prevent its diminution by the beating, issued from the mill in the shape of thick felt cloth.The roughnesses with which the staple of wool is naturally filled were so thoroughly entangled and interlaced together that a material was formed equally suitable either for garments or bedclothes.It was certainly neither merino, muslin, cashmere, rep, satin, alpaca, cloth, nor flannel.It was “Lincolnian felt,” and Lincoln Island possessed yet another manufacture.The colonists had now warm garments and thick bedclothes, and they could without fear await the approach of the winter of 1866-67."
"6月20日这天，大家感到了严寒，潘克洛夫本来想来年春天及时把船造好，现在不得不暂停造船工作，这让他感到十分遗憾。","The severe cold began to be felt about the 20th of June, and, to his great regret, Pencroft was obliged to suspend his boat-building, which he hoped to finish in time for next spring."
"水手很想做的就是去达抱岛进行一次探险，不过哈丁并不同意纯粹为了好奇而出海，因为这片荒芜、干燥的岩石地里显然什么也找不到。乘着相对较小的船在未知的海域里航行150海里，使他不由得心生担忧。假如他们的船出海后到不了达抱岛，也回不了林肯岛，那这只船在危机四伏的太平洋里该怎么办呢？","The sailor’s great idea was to make a voyage of discovery to Tabor Island, although Harding could not approve of a voyage simply for curiosity’s sake, for there was evidently nothing to be found on this desert and almost arid rock.A voyage of a hundred and fifty miles in a comparatively small vessel, over unknown seas, could not but cause him some anxiety.Suppose that their vessel, once out at sea, should be unable to reach Tabor Island, and could not return to Lincoln Island, what would become of her in the midst of the Pacific, so fruitful of disasters?"
"哈丁经常与潘克洛夫谈论这个计划，他发现潘克洛夫对此次出海的要求十分迫切，可潘克洛夫自己却拿不出一个充分的理由来解释他的决心。","Harding often talked over this project with Pencroft, and he found him strangely bent upon undertaking this voyage, for which determination he himself could give no sufficient reason."
"“现在，”有一天工程师这样对他说，“我不得不说你了，我的朋友，你对林肯岛总是这么赞不绝口，而且还时常说一旦不得不离开这里时，你会多么伤心，可现在你是第一个要离开这里的。”","“Now,” said the engineer one day to him, “I must observe, my friend, that after having said so much, in praise of Lincoln Island, after having spoken so often of the sorrow you would feel if you were obliged to forsake it, you are the first to wish to leave it.”"
"“只是离开这里几天，”潘克洛夫回答说，“只是几天而已，上尉。去一去就回来，就看看那个小岛是什么样子！”","“Only to leave it for a few days,” replied Pencroft, “only for a few days, captain.Time to go and come back, and see what that islet is like!”"
"“但是它几乎还没林肯岛这么好。”","“But it is not nearly as good as Lincoln Island.”"
"“这我早就知道了。”","“I know that beforehand.”"
"“那你为什么还想冒险去那里呢？”","“Then why venture there?”"
"“去了解一下那里的动态。”","“To know what is going on in Tabor Island.”"
"“可那里什么也没进行，也不可能有什么事发生。”","“But nothing is going on there; nothing could happen there.”"
"“那谁知道呢？”","“Who knows?”"
"“若是你遇到飓风呢？”","“And if you are caught in a hurricane?”"
"“天气好的季节里不用担心飓风，”潘克洛夫回答说，“不过，上尉，因为我们要以防万一，那我请求你让我只带赫伯特一同前去。”","“There is no fear of that in the fine season,” replied Pencroft.“But, captain, as we must provide against everything, I shall ask your permission to take Herbert only with me on this voyage.”"
"“潘克洛夫，”工程师把手放在水手的肩膀上，说道，“倘若你或这个碰巧成为我们孩子的赫伯特发生了什么不幸，你认为我们不会自责终生吗？”","“Pencroft,” replied the engineer, placing his hand on the sailor’s shoulder, “if any misfortune happens to you, or to this lad, whom chance has made our child, do you think we could ever cease to blame ourselves?”"
"“哈丁上尉，”潘克洛夫带着毫不动摇的信心答道，“我们不会让你们有那样的悲伤。何况，真正要出海的时候，我们还可以再好好谈谈。我在想，当你看到我们装备严实的船，当我们乘着它环绕荒岛时，看着它怎样在海上航行——因为我们是要一起去的，我想，我也敢说，你一定会毫不犹豫地让我去。毫不隐瞒地告诉你，你的船肯定会是杰作。”","“Captain Harding,” replied Pencroft, with unshaken confidence, “we shall not cause you that sorrow.Besides, we will speak further of this voyage, when the time comes to make it.And I fancy, when you have seen our tight-rigged little craft, when you have observed how she behaves at sea, when we sail round our island, for we will do so together—I fancy, I say, that you will no longer hesitate to let me go.I don’t conceal from you that your boat will be a masterpiece.”"
"“应该说是‘我们的’船，潘克洛夫。”工程师回答说，他暂时让了一步。谈话且告一段落，水手和工程师都没有让对方信服，以后他们会继续谈下去。","“Say ‘our’ boat, at least, Pencroft,” replied the engineer, disarmed for the moment.The conversation ended thus, to be resumed later on, without convincing either the sailor or the engineer."
"快到六月底的时候，下了第一场雪。畜栏里早就预备好了大量的饲料，所以居民们就无需每天都去那里了，不过他们决定至少每星期都要有一个人去一次。","The first snow fell towards the end of the month of June.The corral had previously been largely supplied with stores, so that daily visits to it were not requisite; but it was decided that more than a week should never be allowed to pass without someone going to it."
"他们又布置了陷阱，哈丁制造的机器也都试用过了。弄弯的鲸鱼骨头外面覆盖了一层冰，然后又涂了一层厚厚的脂肪，接着他们就把骨头放到森林的边缘，那里野兽前往湖边时经常路过的地方。","Traps were again set, and the machines manufactured by Harding were tried.The bent whalebones, imprisoned in a case of ice, and covered with a thick outer layer of fat, were placed on the border of the forest at a spot where animals usually passed on their way to the lake."
"这个仿效阿留申群岛渔夫们的发明十分奏效，对此工程师非常满意。12只狐狸、几只野猪，甚至还有一只美洲豹，都是用这种方法抓到的，它们死在地上，胃被伸直的鲸鱼骨头给刺穿了。","To the engineer’s great satisfaction, this invention, copied from the Aleutian fishermen, succeeded perfectly.A dozen foxes, a few wild boars, and even a jaguar, were taken in this way, the animals being found dead, their stomachs pierced by the unbent bones."
"有一件事不得不提一下，不仅是因为它本身很有趣，更是因为这是开拓者们第一次试图与外界的人类联系。","An incident must here be related, not only as interesting in itself, but because it was the first attempt made by the colonists to communicate with the rest of mankind."
"吉丁·史佩莱好几次都在想是不是把一封信装在密封的瓶子里，海浪兴许能把它带到有人住的海滩，又或者让鸽子带信呢？","Gideon Spilett had already several times pondered whether to throw into the sea a letter enclosed in a bottle, which currents might perhaps carry to an inhabited coast, or to confide it to pigeons."
"可是林肯岛与任何有人居住的地方都相隔1200英里，谁能希望让鸽子或瓶子跨越这么远的距离呢？这简直是开玩笑。","But how could it be seriously hoped that either pigeons or bottles could cross the distance of twelve hundred miles which separated the island from any inhabited land?It would have been pure folly."
"但是在6月30日这天，赫伯特开枪打中了一只信天翁，它的腿受了点伤，大家把它给抓住了，不过还是费了些事。这只鸟非常美丽，两翼之间的距离有十英尺，它几乎能飞越像太平洋那样宽广的海洋。","But on the 30th of June the capture was effected, not without difficulty, of an albatross, which a shot from Herbert’s gun had slightly wounded in the foot.It was a magnificent bird, measuring ten feet from wing to wing, and which could traverse seas as wide as the Pacific."
"赫伯特原本想留住这只大鸟，因为它的伤很快会痊愈，他想着就能驯服它了，不过史佩莱向他解释了一番，他们不能忽视这次机会，利用这位信使尝试与太平洋的其他岛屿取得联系。因为如果这只信天翁来自于有人居住的地方，毫无疑问，一旦放走了它，它就会马上飞回那里。","Herbert would have liked to keep this superb bird, as its wound would soon heal, and he thought he could tame it; but Spilett explained to him that they should not neglect this opportunity of attempting to communicate by this messenger with the lands of the Pacific; for if the albatross had come from some inhabited region, there was no doubt but that it would return there so soon as it was set free."
"吉丁·史佩莱有时会显现出记者的修养，也许在他心中，很想有机会能将居民在林肯岛上的历险写成一篇激动人心的文章发出去。倘若这篇文章能寄到可敬的约翰·贝内特编辑手里，对于《纽约先驱报》的记者以及刊登这篇文章的报纸销量来说，这会是多大的成功啊！","Perhaps in his heart Gideon Spilett, in whom the journalist sometimes came to the surface, was not sorry to have the opportunity of sending forth to take its chance an exciting article relating the adventures of the settlers in Lincoln Island.What a success for the authorized reporter of the New York Herald, and for the number which should contain the article, if it should ever reach the address of its editor, the Honorable James Bennett!"
"吉丁·史佩莱写好一篇简短的报道，放到了结实、防水的袋子里，并附上了几句话，恳请捡到袋子的人把它寄到《纽约先驱报》。由于信天翁习惯在海面上停歇，所以袋子被系在了它的脖子上，而不是脚上，随后他们就把这个快速的空中信差放飞了，看着它消失在朦胧的西方，开拓者们心里都有些许激动。","Gideon Spilett then wrote out a concise account, which was placed in a strong waterproof bag, with an earnest request to whoever might find it to forward it to the office of the New York Herald.This little bag was fastened to the neck of the albatross, and not to its foot, for these birds are in the habit of resting on the surface of the sea; then liberty was given to this swift courier of the air, and it was not without some emotion that the colonists watched it disappear in the misty west."
"“它会去哪里呢？”潘克洛夫问道。","“Where is he going to?” asked Pencroft."
"“飞往新西兰。”赫伯特回答说。","“Towards New Zealand,” replied Herbert."
"“祝你一路顺风。”水手喊道，其实他本人对这种通讯方式并没有抱太大期望。","“A good voyage to you,” shouted the sailor, who himself did not expect any great result from this mode of correspondence."
"随着冬天的来临，花岗石宫内部的工作又开始了，大家有的缝衣服或者干别的，有的就把气囊上多得用不完的料子拿来制作船帆。","With the winter, work had been resumed in the interior of Granite House, mending clothes and different occupations, among others making the sails for their vessel, which were cut from the inexhaustible balloon-case."
"七月的时候，天气异常寒冷，不过居民们并不缺少木材或煤炭。赛勒斯·哈丁在餐厅又搭建了一个壁炉，他们就在那里度过了一个个漫长的冬夜。他们一边工作一边交谈，手里没活的时候就读书，大家都在这段时间获益良多。","During the month of July the cold was intense, but there was no lack of either wood or coal.Cyrus Harding had established a second fireplace in the dining-room, and there the long winter evenings were spent.Talking while they worked, reading when the hands remained idle, the time passed with profit to all."
"美味的晚饭过后，在有蜡烛照亮、煤炭取暖的屋子里，居民们喝着热气腾腾的接骨木咖啡，嘴里的烟斗吹出芳香的烟，听着外面怒吼的狂风，这对居民们来说着实是种享受。如果说远离家乡且与外界毫无沟通办法的人还能有乐趣，那么居民们的乐趣可谓是无所欠缺了。他们经常谈起自己的祖国和离开他们的朋友，还有美利坚合众国的伟大，它的影响力可是与日俱增的。赛勒斯·哈丁非常关心国家大事，他谈到许多往事、个人见解以及对未来的看法，这让大家都感到饶有兴致。","It was real enjoyment to the settlers when in their room, well lighted with candles, well warmed with coal, after a good dinner, elderberry coffee smoking in the cups, the pipes giving forth an odoriferous smoke, they could hear the storm howling without.Their comfort would have been complete, if complete comfort could ever exist for those who are far from their fellow-creatures, and without any means of communication with them.They often talked of their country, of the friends whom they had left, of the grandeur of the American Republic, whose influence could not but increase; and Cyrus Harding, who had been much mixed up with the affairs of the Union, greatly interested his auditors by his recitals, his views, and his prognostics."
"这引得史佩莱在一天偶然说道：","It chanced one day that Spilett was led to say—"
"“不过，亲爱的赛勒斯，既然你预言所有工商业都会不断发展，那么它们会不会早晚面临完全停止的危机呢？”","“But now, my dear Cyrus, all this industrial and commercial movement to which you predict a continual advance, does it not run the danger of being sooner or later completely stopped?”"
"“停止！因为什么？”","“Stopped!And by what?”"
"“因为煤炭缺失，它可称得上是最宝贵的矿产。”","“By the want of coal, which may justly be called the most precious of minerals.”"
"“不错，它的确是最宝贵的，”工程师回答说，“大自然似乎正想通过产生钻石来证明这一点，因为钻石只是煤炭的结晶。”","“Yes, the most precious indeed,” replied the engineer; “and it would seem that nature wished to prove that it was so by making the diamond, which is simply pure carbon crystallized.”"
"“上尉，你不会是想说，”潘克洛夫插嘴说，“我们炉子里烧的都是以煤炭的形态出现的钻石吗？”","“You don’t mean to say, captain,” interrupted Pencroft, “that we burn diamonds in our stoves in the shape of coal?”"
"“不是，朋友。”哈丁回答说。","“No, my friend,” replied Harding."
"“不过，”吉丁·史佩莱接着说，“你不否认煤炭早晚有一天会全部用光吧？”","“However,” resumed Gideon Spilett, “you do not deny that some day the coal will be entirely consumed?”"
"“嗨！煤炭的矿藏还很多，十万个矿工每年才从中挖出几亿英担，到现在为止还没采完。”","“Oh! the veins of coal are still considerable, and the hundred thousand miners who annually extract from them a hundred millions of hundredweights have not nearly exhausted them.”"
"“随着煤的消耗量不断增加，”吉丁·史佩莱回答说，“可以预见的是，十万名矿工很快变成二十万，开采量会翻倍。”","“With the increasing consumption of coal,” replied Gideon Spilett, “it can be foreseen that the hundred thousand workmen will soon become two hundred thousand, and that the rate of extraction will be doubled.”"
"“那是当然，不过欧洲的煤矿采用新机器后，很快就被更全面地开发，这些矿产开采完后，美洲和澳洲的煤矿还能维持很长一段时间的产业消耗。”","“Doubtless; but after the European mines, which will be soon worked more thoroughly with new machines, the American and Australian mines will for a long time yet provide for the consumption in trade.”"
"“可以维持多长一段时间？”记者问道。","“For how long a time?” asked the reporter."
"“至少250年或300年。”","“For at least two hundred and fifty or three hundred years.”"
"“我们对此可以放心，不过我们的下一代就前景堪忧了！”潘克洛夫说。","“That is reassuring for us, but a bad look-out for our great-grandchildren!” observed Pencroft."
"“他们会发现别的东西。”赫伯特说。","“They will discover something else,” said Herbert."
"“但愿如此吧，”史佩莱回答说，“因为要是没有煤，就没有机器，没有机器也就没有铁路、蒸汽机、工厂以及现代文明不可或缺的一切！”","“It is to be hoped so,” answered Spilett, “for without coal there would be no machinery, and without machinery there would be no railways, no steamers, no manufactories, nothing of that which is indispensable to modern civilization!”"
"“不过他们会发现什么呢？”潘克洛夫问道，“你能猜到吗，上尉？”","“But what will they find?” asked Pencroft.“Can you guess, captain?”"
"“差不多能吧，朋友。”","“Nearly, my friend.”"
"“那他们会烧什么来替代煤呢？”","“And what will they burn instead of coal?”"
"“水。”哈丁回答说。","“Water,” replied Harding."
"“水！”潘克洛夫喊道，“把水当作蒸汽机和引擎的燃料！用水烧水！”","“Water!” cried Pencroft, “water as fuel for steamers and engines! water to heat water!”"
"“是的，不过水已经分解成了原有的元素，”赛勒斯·哈丁回答说，“而且无疑是通过电来分解的，到时候水就成为了一种强大而可操控的力量，所有伟大的发现也都会因为某些难以解释的规律，同时相互契合并变得完善起来。是的，朋友们，我相信早晚有一天水会变成燃料，水的构成元素氢和氧将会分开或是同时使用，它们会成为光和热的无尽之源，这种力量是煤也无法企及的。早晚有一天，蒸汽船的藏煤室和火车的给煤车里就不再装煤，而是装载这两种压缩气体，它们在炉子里燃烧时会产生强大的热能。所以说，没有什么好担心的。只要地球上有人居住，它就会满足人类的需求，只要我们不缺乏植物、动物和矿物，那么我们就不会缺少光或热。我相信，当煤矿用完的时候，我们会用水来加热取暖。水会成为未来的煤。”","“Yes, but water decomposed into its primitive elements,” replied Cyrus Harding, “and decomposed doubtless, by electricity, which will then have become a powerful and manageable force, for all great discoveries, by some inexplicable laws, appear to agree and become complete at the same time.Yes, my friends, I believe that water will one day be employed as fuel, that hydrogen and oxygen which constitute it, used singly or together, will furnish an inexhaustible source of heat and light, of an intensity of which coal is not capable.Some day the coalrooms of steamers and the tenders of locomotives will, instead of coal, be stored with these two condensed gases, which will burn in the furnaces with enormous calorific power.There is, therefore, nothing to fear.As long as the earth is inhabited it will supply the wants of its inhabitants, and there will be no want of either light or heat as long as the productions of the vegetable, mineral or animal kingdoms do not fail us.I believe, then, that when the deposits of coal are exhausted we shall heat and warm ourselves with water.Water will be the coal of the future.”"
"“我很想亲眼看到。”水手说。","“I should like to see that,” observed the sailor."
"“你出生得太早了，潘克洛夫。”纳布说，整个交谈中他就说了这么一句话。","“You were born too soon, Pencroft,” returned Neb, who only took part in the discussion by these words."
"不过，打断整个交谈的不是纳布的话，而是托普再次发出的奇怪吼叫声，上次工程师就因为这个声音感到困惑。内部通道的尽头有一口井，此时的托普边叫边绕着井口奔跑。","However, it was not Neb’s speech which interrupted the conversation, but Top’s barking, which broke out again with that strange intonation which had before perplexed the engineer.At the same time Top began to run round the mouth of the well, which opened at the extremity of the interior passage."
"“托普为什么会那样叫呢？”潘克洛夫问道。","“What can Top be barking in that way for?” asked Pencroft."
"“贾普怎么也那样叫起来？”赫伯特也问道。","“And Jup be growling like that?” added Herbert."
"事实上，猩猩也和狗一样表现出明显的躁动，而且，奇怪的是，两个动物表现出的不是愤怒，而是不安。","In fact the orang, joining the dog, gave unequivocal signs of agitation, and, singular to say, the two animals appeared more uneasy than angry."
"“很明显，”吉丁·史佩莱说，“这口井直接与大海相通，一些海里的动物时不时会来井底呼吸。”","“It is evident,” said Gideon Spilett, “that this well is in direct communication with the sea, and that some marine animal comes from time to time to breathe at the bottom.”"
"“这很明显，”水手说，“再也没有比这更好的解释了。安静，托普！”潘克洛夫转身对狗说：“还有你，贾普，回到自己的房间去！”","“That’s evident,” replied the sailor, “and there can be no other explanation to give.Quiet there, Top!” added Pencroft, turning to the dog, “and you, Jup, be off to your room!”"
"猩猩和狗都安静下来了。贾普上床睡觉了，而托普却依然呆在屋里，整个晚上它每隔一会儿就会发出低沉的吼声。对于这个话题再没有深入的交谈，不过工程师依旧为此事而皱着眉头。","The ape and the dog were silent.Jup went off to bed, but Top remained in the room, and continued to utter low growls at intervals during the rest of the evening.There was no further talk on the subject, but the incident, however, clouded the brow of the engineer."
"七月剩下的日子不是霜就是雨。气温没有去年冬天低，最冷的时候也有华氏8度。不过,虽然今年冬天没有那么冷，但暴风雪却很多，而且海潮还时常威胁着“石窟”的安全。有时候，巨浪就像被潜流给掀起来了一样,猛烈地拍打着花岗石宫的墙壁，轰隆作响。","During the remainder of the month of July there was alternate rain and frost.The temperature was not so low as during the preceding winter, and its maximum did not exceed eight degrees Fahrenheit.But although this winter was less cold, it was more troubled by storms and squalls; the sea besides often endangered the safety of the Chimneys.At times it almost seemed as if an under-current raised these monstrous billows which thundered against the wall of Granite House."
"居民们倚在窗户边，看着滚滚巨浪敲打在下面的岩石上，他们不禁为大海这种无力的愤怒的壮观景象感到叹为观止。波涛在闪亮的泡沫中翻滚，整个海滩都消失在了狂澜中，悬崖似乎从海中冒出来，浪花上升到100多英尺的高度。","When the settlers, leaning from their windows, gazed on the huge watery masses breaking beneath their eyes, they could not but admire the magnificent spectacle of the ocean in its impotent fury.The waves rebounded in dazzling foam, the beach entirely disapppearing under the raging flood, and the cliff appearing to emerge from the sea itself, the spray rising to a height of more than a hundred feet."
"在这样的风暴里，冒险外出是困难的，甚至是危险的，因为经常有树被吹倒，不过，开拓者们向来都每个星期去一次畜栏。所幸的是，这块圈地有富兰克林山的东南山脉作为屏障，飓风侵袭不到这里，大树、棚屋和栅栏都得以保存，但是眺望岗上的家禽场由于直面东边吹来的强风，遭受了很大的损害。鸽棚的屋顶被吹走了两次，栅栏也被刮倒了。所有这些都需要重新修整，还要比以前更结实，因为林肯岛显然处在太平洋最危险的一个地方。看起来它似乎形成了大旋风的中心点，狂风从四面八方吹向它，就像鞭子不断抽打陀螺，只不过这个陀螺是静止的，而鞭子却在不停地围着它转。八月的第一个星期，天气变得温和了很多，大气也恢复了原来似乎永远失去的宁静。不过平静过后，天气又变得十分寒冷，温度计的指针都降到了华氏零下八度。","During these storms it was difficult and even dangerous to venture out, owing to the frequently falling trees; however, the colonists never allowed a week to pass without having paid a visit to the corral.Happily, this enclosure, sheltered by the southeastern spur of Mount Franklin, did not greatly suffer from the violence of the hurricanes, which spared its trees, sheds, and palisades; but the poultry-yard on Prospect Heights, being directly exposed to the gusts of wind from the east, suffered considerable damage.The pigeon-house was twice unroofed and the paling blown down.All this required to be remade more solidly than before, for, as may be clearly seen, Lincoln Island was situated in one of the most dangerous parts of the Pacific.It really appeared as if it formed the central point of vast cyclones, which beat it perpetually as the whip does the top, only here it was the top which was motionless and the whip which moved.During the first week of the month of August the weather became more moderate, and the atmosphere recovered the calm which it appeared to have lost forever.With the calm the cold again became intense, and the thermometer fell to eight degrees Fahrenheit, below zero."
"8月3日，居民们实践了他们谈论了好多天的远足，那就是进入林肯岛东南部，到达潦凫沼地。许多水禽到这里过冬，猎人们看得好馋。这里有很多野鸭、鹬、短颈野鸭和，大家一致决定花一天时间专门捕捉它们。","On the 3rd of August an excursion which had been talked of for several days was made into the southeastern part of the island, towards Tadorn Marsh.The hunters were tempted by the aquatic game which took up their winter quarters there.Wild duck, snipe, teal and grebe abounded there, and it was agreed that a day should be devoted to an expedition against these birds."
"不光是吉丁·史佩莱和赫伯特，就连潘克洛夫和纳布也加入到此次远足的队伍了。赛勒斯·哈丁斯说有工作要做，没有加入他们，独自留在了花岗石宫。","Not only Gideon Spilett and Herbert, but Pencroft and Neb also took part in this excursion.Cyrus Harding alone, alleging some work as an excuse, did not join them, but remained at Granite House."
"猎人们答应天黑前回来，为了到达潦凫沼地，就顺着气球港的方向进发，托普和贾普也和他们在一起。他们一过慈悲河桥，工程师就把桥提起来然后回去了，他打算进行一项工作，而他也只想自己单独完成。","The hunters proceeded in the direction of Port Balloon, in order to reach the marsh, after having promised to be back by the evening.Top and Jup accompanied them.As soon as they had passed over the Mercy Bridge, the engineer raised it and returned, intending to put into execution a project for the performance of which he wished to be alone."
"这个工作就是仔细查看井的内部，井口与花岗石宫的通道在同一水平面上，由于它曾经为格兰特湖输送了水，所以它与大海连通。","Now this project was to minutely explore the interior well, the mouth of which was on a level with the passage of Granite House, and which communicated with the sea, since it formerly supplied a way to the waters of the lake."
"为什么托普会经常围着这个井口转呢？某种不安的感觉似乎使它靠近这口井时，为什么它会发出如此奇怪的吼叫声呢？为什么贾普会和托普一样焦躁呢？这口井除了通向大海外还有别的支路吗？它是不是能延伸到岛屿的其他地方？这些都是赛勒斯·哈丁想要知道的。于是，他决定趁伙伴们都不在的时候探索一下井里，现在机会正摆在他面前。","Why did Top so often run round this opening?Why did he utter such strange barks when a sort of uneasiness seemed to draw him towards this well?Why did Jup join Top in a sort of common anxiety?Had this well branches besides the communication with the sea?Did it spread towards other parts of the island?This is what Cyrus Harding wished to know.He had resolved, therefore, to attempt the exploration of the well during the absence of his companions, and an opportunity for doing so had now presented itself."
"利用绳梯下到井底就很容易，这个梯子自从升降梯弄好后就没有再用过了。工程师把绳梯拿到直径近六英尺的井口，把绳梯的上端紧紧地系在井口后，他就把另一端放到了井里。然后，他点了一盏灯，手里拿好一把左轮枪，腰间别了一把弯刀，接着就下井了。","It was easy to descend to the bottom of the well by employing the rope ladder which had not been used since the establishment of the lift.The engineer drew the ladder to the hole, the diameter of which measured nearly six feet, and allowed it to unroll itself after having securely fastened its upper extremity.Then, having lighted a lantern, taken a revolver, and placed a cutlass in his belt, he began the descent."
"井里空空的，什么也没有，不过周围到处都是突出的尖石，敏捷的动物很可能会顺着这些尖石爬到井口。","The sides were everywhere entire; but points of rock jutted out here and there, and by means of these points it would have been quite possible for an active creature to climb to the mouth of the well."
"工程师想到了这点，他用灯的光仔细地查看了这些尖石，不过他找不到任何痕迹或缺损之处能证明，它们曾在最近或是过去的任何时间被当成阶梯使用过。赛勒斯·哈丁又往下走了点，他将灯举起来往四处照。","The engineer remarked this; but although he carefully examined these points by the light of his lantern, he could find no impression, no fracture which could give any reason to suppose that they had either recently or at any former time been used as a staircase.Cyrus Harding descended deeper, throwing the light of his lantern on all sides."
"他还是没有看到任何可疑的东西。","He saw nothing suspicious."
"工程师下到了最后一档，这时他到达了水面，此时的水面非常平静。不论是这个水面还是井里的其他地方，都没有任何可以通往悬崖内部的通道。哈丁用刀柄敲了敲井壁，墙上发出的声音听起来很结实。这是很结实的花岗岩，没有任何动物能从中打出一条通道。海滩的岩石层下有一条将井底与大海相连的沟渠，要游到井底，然后再爬到井口必须经过这条沟渠，只有水生动物才能做到这点。至于说这条沟渠的终点在哪里，位于海岸的何处，以及在水下有多深，这些问题还不能回答。","When the engineer had reached the last rounds he came upon the water, which was then perfectly calm.Neither at its level nor in any other part of the well, did any passage open, which could lead to the interior of the cliff.The wall which Harding struck with the hilt of his cutlass sounded solid.It was compact granite, through which no living being could force a way.To arrive at the bottom of the well and then climb up to its mouth it was necessary to pass through the channel under the rocky subsoil of the beach, which placed it in communication with the sea, and this was only possible for marine animals.As to the question of knowing where this channel ended, at what point of the shore, and at what depth beneath the water, it could not be answered."
"赛勒斯·哈丁查看完后，就爬上去把梯子收好，盖上井盖，回到餐厅深思，他一边走一边在自言自语：","Then Cyrus Harding, having ended his survey, re-ascended, drew up the ladder, covered the mouth of the well, and returned thoughtfully to the diningroom, saying to himself,—"
"“我什么也没有看到，可是那里肯定有什么东西！”","“I have seen nothing, and yet there is something there!”"
"第十二章","Chapter 12"
"晚上那些打猎者回来了，他们玩得很尽兴，不夸张地说，收获颇丰，事实上，他们四个人是满载而归。托普脖子上挂着一串短颈野鸭，贾普身上挂着一圈鹬。","In the evening the hunters returned, having enjoyed good sport, and being literally loaded with game; indeed, they had as much as four men could possibly carry.Top wore a necklace of teal and Jup wreaths of snipe round his body."
"“这里，主人，”纳布大声喊，“我们有事情做了！把这些东西储存起来，做成馅饼，我们就有可喜的储藏了！但是我必须找个人帮助我。我要依靠你了，潘克洛夫。”","“Here, master,” cried Neb; “here’s something to employ our time!Preserved and made into pies we shall have a welcome store!But I must have some one to help me.I count on you, Pencroft.”"
"“不行，纳布，”水手回答，“我还有船上的索具要完成和照看，你必须自己做了。”","“No, Neb,” replied the sailor; “I have the rigging of the vessel to finish and to look after, and you will have to do without me.”"
"“你呢，赫伯特先生？”","“And you, Mr. Herbert?”"
"“我明天必须去畜栏，纳布。”少年回答。","“I must go to the corral to-morrow, Neb,” replied the lad."
"“那么就是你了，史佩莱先生，你愿意帮助我吗？”","“It will be you then, Mr. Spilett, who will help me?”"
"“我愿意，纳布，我会帮你，”记者说，“但是，我要提醒你，如果你将你的烹饪秘诀透漏给我，我会公布的。”","“To oblige you, Neb, I will,” replied the reporter; “but I warn you that if you disclose your receipts to me, I shall publish them.”"
"“什么时候都可以，史佩莱先生，”纳布回答，“什么时候都可以。”","“Whenever you like, Mr. Spilett,” replied Neb; “whenever you like.”"
"第二天，吉丁·史佩莱就成了纳布的助手了，在他的厨房实验室里工作。工程师已经把自己昨天探索的结果告诉了他，在这一点上，记者与哈丁持相同观点，虽然他还没找到什么，但是秘密是仍旧要去发现的！","And so the next day Gideon Spilett became Neb’s assistant and was installed in his culinary laboratory.The engineer had previously made known to him the result of the exploration which he had made the day before, and on this point the reporter shared Harding’s opinion, that although he had found nothing, a secret still remained to be discovered!"
"寒霜又持续了一周，居民们除了去照料禽场外就没有离开过花岗岩宫。住所里充满了令人谗涎欲滴的香味，这香味是从纳布和记者娴熟的工作中发出来的。但是，他们并没有把捕获的所有猎物都做成储藏食品。猎物在严寒中可以保存得十分完好，因此他们吃新鲜的野鸭和其他野禽，并断言这比世界上所有其他的水禽都要好吃。","The frost continued for another week, and the settlers did not leave Granite House unless to look after the poultry-yard.The dwelling was filled with appetizing odors, which were emitted from the learned manipulation of Neb and the reporter.But all the results of the chase were not made into preserved provisions; and as the game kept perfectly in the intense cold, wild duck and other fowl were eaten fresh, and declared superior to all other aquatic birds in the known world."
"这一周，赫伯特技巧娴熟地用着水手的针，帮助潘克洛夫完成了船帆的工作。绳索也不缺了。由于找到了索具和气球，他们从网上弄来的绳索质量都很好，水手把它们全部用上了。船帆上系了结实的螺栓索，还剩下很多，都做了升降索、桅索和帆脚索等等。在潘克洛夫的指导下，赛勒斯·哈丁利用转动的车床做了一些滑车。因此，在船造好以前，索具就完全准备好了。潘克洛夫还做了一面国旗，这对每个真正的美国人来说都很珍贵，上面有他们光荣的合众国的星条。上面的颜色是从某些用作染料的植物中得来的，这些植物在岛上很丰富。国旗上有着光辉灿烂的37颗星，代表着合众国的37个州，除此之外，水手又加上了第38颗，代表“林肯州”，因为他认为这个岛已经归入伟大的合众国了。“就算事实上没有归入，在心里已经归入了！”他说。","During this week, Pencroft, aided by Herbert, who handled the sailmaker’s needle with much skill, worked with such energy that the sails of the vessel were finished.There was no want of cordage.Thanks to the rigging which had been discovered with the case of the balloon, the ropes and cables from the net were all of good quality, and the sailor turned them all to account.To the sails were attached strong bolt ropes, and there still remained enough from which to make the halyards, shrouds, and sheets, etc.The blocks were manufactured by Cyrus Harding under Pencroft’s directions by means of the turning lathe.It therefore happened that the rigging was entirely prepared before the vessel was finished.Pencroft also manufactured a flag, that flag so dear to every true American, containing the stars and stripes of their glorious Union.The colors for it were supplied from certain plants used in dyeing, and which were very abundant in the island; only to the thirty-seven stars, representing the thirty-seven States of the Union, which shine on the American flag, the sailor added a thirty-eighth, the star of “the State of Lincoln,” for he considered his island as already united to the great republic.“And,” said he, “it is so already in heart, if not in deed!”"
"在此期间，他们把国旗升在花岗岩宫中间的窗户上，居民们向它欢呼三声以示敬意。","In the meantime, the flag was hoisted at the central window of Granite House, and the settlers saluted it with three cheers."
"这时候，寒冷的季节即将结束，第二个冬季似乎要在没有任何异常事件中过去了，可是，在8月11日的晚上，眺望岗的高地几乎遭到完全的破坏。","The cold season was now almost at an end, and it appeared as if this second winter was to pass without any unusual occurrence, when on the night of the 11th of August, the plateau of Prospect Heights was menaced with complete destruction."
"忙碌了一天后，开拓者们睡得很熟，第二天早晨接近四点钟的时候，他们突然被托普的叫声惊醒了。","After a busy day the colonists were sleeping soundly, when towards four o’clock in the morning they were suddenly awakened by Top’s barking."
"这次狗不是在靠近井口的地方叫，而是在门口叫，它用前爪挠门，好像要把它打开。同时，贾普也发出尖叫声。","The dog was not this time barking near the mouth of the well, but at the threshold of the door, at which he was scratching as if he wished to burst it open.Jup was also uttering piercing cries."
"“嘿，托普！”纳布喊道，他是第一个被惊醒的。但是狗继续叫，还比之前更凶猛了。","“Hello, Top!” cried Neb, who was the first awake.But the dog continued to bark more furiously than ever."
"“现在是怎么回事？”哈丁问。","“What’s the matter now?” asked Harding."
"所有人都急忙穿上衣服，冲到窗口，把窗户打开。","And all dressing in haste rushed to the windows, which they opened."
"下面是一片冰雪，微光下看起来有些灰暗。居民们什么也看不见，但是他们听到黑暗中传来一种异常的叫喊声。很明显，有一群动物侵入了海滩，只是他们还看不清。","Beneath their eyes was spread a sheet of snow which looked gray in the dim light.The settlers could see nothing, but they heard a singular yelping noise away in the darkness.It was evident that the beach had been invaded by a number of animals which could not be seen."
"“那是些什么动物啊？”潘克洛夫喊道。","“What are they?” cried Pencroft."
"“狼、美洲豹，或是大猩猩？”纳布回答说。","“Wolves, jaguars, or apes?” replied Neb."
"“他们几乎到达高地了。”记者说。","“They have nearly reached the plateau,” said the reporter."
"“还有我们的家禽场，”赫伯特大声叫道，“我们的菜园！”","“And our poultry-yard,” exclaimed Herbert, “and our garden!”"
"“它们是从哪儿过来的呢？”潘克洛夫问。","“Where can they have crossed?” asked Pencroft."
"“它们一定是从岸边桥上过来的，”工程师回答说，“肯定是谁忘记把桥拉起来了。”","“They must have crossed the bridge on the shore,” replied the engineer, “which one of us must have forgotten to close.”"
"“是的，”史佩莱说，“我忘了把桥扯起来了。”","“True,” said Spilett, “I remember having left it open.”"
"“你干的好事，史佩莱先生。”水手大喊。","“A fine job you have made of it, Mr. Spilett,” cried the sailor."
"“事已定局，无法挽回，”赛勒斯·哈丁回答，“我们最好商量一下该怎么办。”","“What is done cannot be undone,” replied Cyrus Harding.“We must consult what it will now be best to do.”"
"哈丁和他的同伴不停地互相说着话，有的问，有的答。可以肯定的是，那些动物已经跨过桥了，并且已经侵袭到海岸了，不论它们是什么东西，都能够登上慈悲河左岸，到达眺望岗。因此，他们必须尽快赶上去阻止这些动物，必要的时候还要和它们拼一场。","Such were the questions and answers which were rapidly exchanged between Harding and his companions.It was certain that the bridge had been crossed, that the shore had been invaded by animals, and that whatever they might be they could by ascending the left bank of the Mercy reach Prospect Heights.They must therefore be advanced against quickly and fought with if necessary."
"“可是，这些野兽是什么呢？”他们听到叫声比先前更响，又问了一遍这个问题。这些喊叫声使赫伯特吃了一惊,他记得第一次去红河发源地的时候，听到过这种声音。","“But what are these beasts?” was asked a second time, as the yelpings were again heard more loudly than before.These yelps made Herbert start, and he remembered having heard them before during his first visit to the sources of the Red Creek."
"“它们是山狐狸！”他喊道。","“They are colpeo foxes!” he exclaimed."
"“冲上去！”水手大喊。","“Forward!” shouted the sailor."
"所有人都拿起手斧、卡宾枪和左轮枪防卫自己，跑进升降梯，很快就到海岸了。","And all arming themselves with hatchets, carbines, and revolvers, threw themselves into the lift and soon set foot on the shore."
"山狐狸是很危险的动物，它们数目众多，因饥饿而烦躁不安。尽管如此，这些开拓者还是毫不犹豫地把自己置身于这群动物中，发射出第一排子弹，黑暗中明显地发出几点亮光，吓得攻击者后退了。","Colpeos are dangerous animals when in great numbers and irritated by hunger, nevertheless the colonists did not hesitate to throw themselves into the midst of the troop, and their first shots vividly lighting up the darkness made their assailants draw back."
"主要的问题就是要阻止这些盗贼到达高地，否则菜园和家禽场就要任凭他们的摆布，巨大的、可能是不能挽回的损失就难免成为结局，尤其是对麦田来说。可是，它们只能通过慈悲河的左岸入侵高地，只要守住这条河流和花岗岩峭壁之间的狭窄的堤岸，就足以把山狐狸阻挡住。","The chief thing was to hinder these plunderers from reaching the plateau, for the garden and the poultry-yard would then have been at their mercy, and immense, perhaps irreparable mischief, would inevitably be the result, especially with regard to the corn-field.But as the invasion of the plateau could only be made by the left bank of the Mercy, it was sufficient to oppose the colpeos on the narrow bank between the river and the cliff of granite."
"大家都明白这一点，在赛勒斯·哈丁的指导下，他们到达了指定地点，此时，这些山狐狸在幽暗中凶猛地乱窜。哈丁、吉丁·史佩莱、赫伯特、潘克洛夫和纳布形成一条坚不可摧的防线。托普张开他那可怕的大口，站在开拓者们前面，后面跟着贾普，他手里挥动着一根有节的棍棒，挥舞起来就像拿着球棒似的。","This was plain to all, and, by Cyrus Harding’s orders, they reached the spot indicated by him, while the colpeos rushed fiercely through the gloom.Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Pencroft and Neb posted themselves in impregnable line.Top, his formidable jaws open, preceded the colonists, and he was followed by Jup, armed with knotty cudgel, which he brandished like a club."
"外面漆黑一片，只有当他们开枪时，才能借着左轮枪的闪光看到那些攻击者，它们至少有一百只，眼睛通红，就像热炭。","The night was extremely dark, it was only by the flashes from the revolvers as each person fired that they could see their assailants, who were at least a hundred in number, and whose eyes were glowing like hot coals."
"“绝不能让它们过来！”潘克洛夫大声叫。","“They must not pass!” shouted Pencroft."
"“它们过不来的！”工程师应道。","“They shall not pass!” returned the engineer."
"但是，如果它们没有过来，并不是它们不想试着过来。后面的山狐狸推动着最前面的，居民们也用左轮枪和手斧与它们进行着不断的格斗。有几只山狐狸已经被打死在地上了，但是它们的数目似乎没有减少，也许它们的增援力量正在不断地向桥上涌来。","But if they did not pass it was not for want of having attempted it.Those in the rear pushed on the foremost assailants, and it was an incessant struggle with revolvers and hatchets.Several colpeos already lay dead on the ground, but their number did not appear to diminish, and it might have been supposed that reinforcements were continually arriving over the bridge."
"开拓者们很快就只好和它们近距离搏斗了，他们伤了几处，不过庆幸的是伤势很轻。一只山狐狸像山猫似的跳到纳布的后背上，赫伯特用左轮枪一枪把它打死，救出了纳布。托普真的狂怒了，它冲过去咬住狐狸的喉咙，立马勒死它们。贾普勇敢地挥舞着他手中的武器，他们想要它呆在后面是白费力气。毫无疑问，它生来目光就很敏锐，能够透过昏暗看见东西，因此，它总是到战斗最激烈的地方去，还不时地发出嘶嘶尖叫声，表示它非常兴奋。","The colonists were soon obliged to fight at close quarters, not without receiving some wounds, though happily very slight ones.Herbert had, with a shot from his revolver, rescued Neb, on whose back a colpeo had sprung like a tiger cat.Top fought with actual fury, flying at the throats of the foxes and strangling them instantaneously.Jup wielded his weapon valiantly, and it was in vain that they endeavored to keep him in the rear.Endowed doubtless with sight which enabled him to pierce the obscurity, he was always in the thick of the fight uttering from time to time—a sharp hissing sound, which was with him the sign of great rejoicing."
"有时候，它会走出很远，借助左轮枪的闪光，才看见它被五、六只山狐狸包围着，而它却沉着应战。","At one moment he advanced so far, that by the light from a revolver he was seen surrounded by five or six large colpeos, with whom he was coping with great coolness."
"不过，搏斗终于结束了，经过了足足两个小时的激战，居民们才取得了胜利！第一道白天来临的迹象无疑决定了入侵者的败退，它们越过桥梁，向北窜去，纳布立即跑过去把桥拉起来。等晨曦充分照亮战场的时候，居民们数了数散布在岸上的死狐狸，多达50只。","However, the struggle was ended at last, and victory was on the side of the settlers, but not until they had fought for two long hours!The first signs of the approach of day doubtless determined the retreat of their assailants, who scampered away towards the North, passing over the bridge, which Neb ran immediately to raise.When day had sufficiently lighted up the field of battle, the settlers counted as many as fifty dead bodies scattered about on the shore."
"“贾普！”潘克洛夫大喊，“贾普哪里去了？”贾普不见了。它的朋友纳布喊它的名字，这是它第一次没有回应朋友的喊声。","“And Jup!” cried Pencroft; “where is Jup?”Jup had disappeared.His friend Neb called him, and for the first time Jup did not reply to his friend’s call."
"大家都动身去找贾普，人人都在发抖，害怕在尸堆里发现它，他们把染红积雪的尸体清到一边。最后，在狐狸堆中间发现了贾普，这些死狐狸的下巴破裂，身体支离破碎，表明这个勇猛的动物用可怕的棍子与它们进行了一场搏斗。","Everyone set out in search of Jup, trembling lest he should be found among the slain; they cleared the place of the bodies which stained the snow with their blood.Jup was found in the midst of a heap of colpeos whose broken jaws and crushed bodies showed that they had to do with the terrible club of the intrepid animal."
"可怜的贾普手里还握着一截破棍子，但是没有了武器后，它寡不敌众，胸部受了几处重伤。","Poor Jup still held in his hand the stump of his broken cudgel, but deprived of his weapon he had been overpowered by numbers, and his chest was covered with severe wounds."
"“它还活着。”纳布在它身边弯下腰，喊道。","“He is living,” cried Neb, who was bending over him."
"“我们要救活它，”水手回答，“我们要把它当作自己人一样护理它。”","“And we will save him,” replied the sailor.“We will nurse him as if he was one of ourselves.”"
"贾普好像听得懂似的，把头靠在潘克洛夫的肩膀上，好像在感谢他。水手自己也受了伤，不过伤势不重，他的同伴也是这样的情况。多亏了他们的火器，他们几乎总能使攻击者无法靠近，因此，只有这只猩猩的情形比较严重。","It appeared as if Jup understood, for he leaned his head on Pencroft’s shoulder as if to thank him.The sailor was wounded himself, but his wound was insignificant, as were those of his companions; for thanks to their firearms they had been almost always able to keep their assailants at a distance. it was therefore only the orang whose condition was serious."
"纳布和潘克洛夫抬着贾普，把它放在升降梯里，它的嘴里不时地发出轻微的呻吟声。大家轻轻地把它升到花岗石宫。之后，他们从其中一个床上拿了一个垫子，让它躺在上面，又十分小心地清洗它的伤口。贾普似乎没有受到巨大的创伤，但是由于失血过多，身体非常虚弱，伤口包扎好以后，很快又发起高烧来。大家让它躺了下来，饮食安排得非常严格，就像纳布所说的，对待它就像对待“一个真正的人一样”。他们给它喝了几杯清凉饮料，这些成分是从花岗石宫的植物草药箱子里获得的。贾普刚开始还有些焦躁不安，但是渐渐地它的呼吸就均匀了，大家也让它安静地睡着。托普时常蹑手蹑脚地，可以这样说，过来探访它的朋友，似乎对大家给予它的关心很满意。贾普的一只手搭在床边上，托普非常同情地舔着它的手。","Jup, carried by Neb and Pencroft, was placed in the lift, and only a slight moan now and then escaped his lips.He was gently drawn up to Granite House.There he was laid on a mattress taken from one of the beds, and his wounds were bathed with the greatest care.It did not appear that any vital part had been reached, but Jup was very weak from loss of blood, and a high fever soon set in after his wounds had been dressed.He was laid down, strict diet was imposed, “just like a real person,” as Neb said, and they made him swallow several cups of a cooling drink, for which the ingredients were supplied from the vegetable medicine chest of Granite House.Jup was at first restless, but his breathing gradually became more regular, and he was left sleeping quietly.From time to time Top, walking on tip-toe, as one might say, came to visit his friend, and seemed to approve of all the care that had been taken of him.One of Jup’s hands hung over the side of his bed, and Top licked it with a sympathizing air."
"他们利用白天的时间，将死狐狸拖到远西森林里去，并把它们深深地埋葬在那里。","They employed the day in interring the dead, who were dragged to the forest of the Far West, and there buried deep."
"这次的袭击差一点造成严重的后果，这给居民们一个教训。从这以后，他们睡前必须确保有人把桥拉起，不会受到侵犯。","This attack, which might have had such serious consequences, was a lesson to the settlers, who from this time never went to bed until one of their number had made sure that all the bridges were raised, and that no invasion was possible."
"他们非常焦急地等了好几天后，贾普开始好转了。由于它身体结实，已经度过难关，烧也退了，吉丁·史佩莱略微懂得医术，他告诉大家它已经脱离了危险。8月16日，贾普开始进食了。纳布给它做了几份小小的甜美佳肴，“病人”还吃得津津有味，因为要说贾普有什么宠物的缺点，就是有点贪吃，纳布也从未给它纠正这个缺点。","However, Jup, after having given them serious anxiety for several days, began to recover.His constitution brought him through, the fever gradually subsided, and Gideon Spilett, who was a bit of a doctor, pronounced him quite out of danger.On the 16th of August, Jup began to eat.Neb made him nice little sweet dishes, which the invalid devoured with great relish, for if he had a pet failing it was that of being somewhat of a gourmend, and Neb had never done anything to cure him of this fault."
"“怎么办呢？”他对吉丁·史佩莱说，他有时会规劝纳布不要把猩猩宠坏了。“除了味觉上的享受外，可怜的贾普没有其他的乐趣，我非常愿意能够在这方面给它的服务一些回报！”","“What would you have?” said he to Gideon Spilett, who sometimes expostulated with him for spoiling the ape.“Poor Jup has no other pleasure than that of the palate, and I am only too glad to be able to reward his services in this way!”"
"在床上躺了十天后，8月21日，贾普起床了。它的伤口已经痊愈了，显然，不用很长时间它就能恢复一贯的力气和敏捷了。像所有复原期的病人一样，它的胃口特别大，记者让它想吃多少就吃多少，因为他相信，这个猩猩有抑制自己进食过多的本能，而这种本能是有理性的人类所缺乏的。纳布看到他学生的食欲恢复后，感到很高兴。","Ten days after taking to his bed, on the 21st of August, Master Jup arose.His wounds were healed, and it was evident that he would not be long in regaining his usual strength and agility.Like all convalescents, he was tremendously hungry, and the reporter allowed him to eat as much as he liked, for he trusted to that instinct, which is too often wanting in reasoning beings, to keep the orang from any excess.Neb was delighted to see his pupil’s appetite returning."
"“尽情地吃吧，我的贾普，”他说，“不要省着，你为我们流了血，我要做的最起码的事情就是让你恢复健康！”","“Eat away, my Jup,” said he, “and don’t spare anything; you have shed your blood for us, and it is the least I can do to make you strong again!”"
"8月25日，大家听见纳布在呼喊他们。","On the 25th of August Neb’s voice was heard calling to his companions."
"“上尉、史佩莱先生、赫伯特先生、潘克洛夫，过来！快过来！”","“Captain, Mr. Spilett, Mr. Herbert, Pencroft, come! come!”"
"开拓者们当时都在餐厅里，听到纳布的喊声后，起身到贾普的房间里。","The colonists, who were together in the dining-room, rose at Neb’s call, who was then in Jup’s room."
"“发生什么事了？”记者问。","“What’s the matter?” asked the reporter."
"“看啊。”纳布大声笑着回答。他们看到什么了呢？原来小贾普在花岗岩宫的过道处，像个顽童似的盘腿而坐，镇静而又严肃地吸着烟！","“Look,” replied Neb, with a shout of laughter.And what did they see?Master Jup smoking calmly and seriously, sitting crosslegged like a Turk at the entrance to Granite House!"
"“我的烟斗，”潘克洛夫喊道，“他拿走了我的烟斗！喂，我的好贾普，我把它当礼物送给你了！抽吧，老兄，抽吧！”","“My pipe,” cried Pencroft.“He has taken my pipe!Hello, my honest Jup, I make you a present of it!Smoke away, old boy, smoke away!”"
"贾普庄重地吐着烟雾，它似乎感到非常满意。哈丁对这件事情似乎并不感到吃惊，他列举了几个例子，说明驯服的猩猩会吸烟已经变得很常见了。","And Jup gravely puffed out clouds of smoke which seemed to give him great satisfaction.Harding did not appear to be much astonished at this incident, and he cited several examples of tame apes, to whom the use of tobacco had become quite familiar."
"但是从今天起，贾普就有了自己的烟斗，就是水手原来的那个，挂在它房间里，靠近储存烟草的地方。贾普自己装满烟，用燃烧的火炭点着，似乎自己成为了猿猴中最幸福的。忠实的贾普和可敬的水手之间本来友谊就很深厚，现在又有了共同的爱好，不难理解，他们的友谊进一步加深了。","But from this day Master Jup had a pipe of his own, the sailor’s ex-pipe, which was hung in his room near his store of tobacco.He filled it himself, lighted it with a glowing coal, and appeared to be the happiest of quadrumana.It may readily be understood that this similarity of tastes of Jup and Pencroft served to tighten the bonds of friendship which already existed between the honest ape and the worthy sailor."
"“也许它真的是个人，”有时候潘克洛夫对纳布说，“如果有一天，你听见它和我们说话，你会感到吃惊吗？”","“Perhaps he is really a man,” said Pencroft sometimes to Neb.“Should you be surprised to hear him beginning to speak to us some day?”"
"“我保证，不会，”纳布回答，“让我感到惊讶的是，它之前一直没和我们说话，它现在就差说话了。”","“My word, no,” replied Neb.“What astonishes me is that he hasn’t spoken to us before, for now he wants nothing but speech!”"
"“如果有一天它对我说，‘潘克洛夫，我们换一下烟斗吧’，我会觉得很有意思。”","“It would amuse me all the same,” resumed the sailor, “if some fine day he said to me, ‘Suppose we change pipes, Pencroft’.”"
"“是啊，”纳布回答，“可惜它生来就是个哑巴！”","“Yes,” replied Neb, “what a pity he was born dumb!”"
"九月初，冬季结束，大家又开始急切地开始工作了。造船工作进展得很迅速，甲板已经完全铺好，船身内部用蒸气熏弯的肋条牢固地连接起来，符合模具的所有目的。","With the month of September the winter ended, and the works were again eagerly commenced.The building of the vessel advanced rapidly, she was already completely decked over, and all the inside parts of the hull were firmly united with ribs bent by means of steam, which answered all the purposes of a mold."
"由于并不缺乏木头，潘克洛夫向工程师提议，给船身做一个双层的内壁，确保船身更牢固些。","As there was no want of wood, Pencroft proposed to the engineer to give a double lining to the hull, to insure the strength of the vessel."
"哈丁也不知道他们将来会遇到什么情况，就同意了水手的意见，将船建造得尽量结实些。9月15日，船的内部和甲板全部完工了。为了填充漏缝，他们用干海藻作为填絮，用锤子把它们凿到木板之间的空隙中。他们又从森林中的松树上弄来了大量的松脂，煮沸后，将它们盖在上面封住。","Harding, not knowing what the future might have in store for them, approved the sailor’s idea of making the craft as strong as possible.The interior and deck of the vessel was entirely finished towards the 15th of September.For calking the seams they made oakum of dry seaweed, which was hammered in between the planks; then these seams were covered with boiling tar, which was obtained in great abundance from the pines in the forest."
"这只船操作起来很简单。他们首先在石灰上把一块块沉重的花岗岩砌成压舱物，这些东西重12000磅。","The management of the vessel was very simple.She had from the first been ballasted with heavy blocks of granite walled up, in a bed of lime, twelve thousand pounds of which they stowed away."
"他们又在压舱物上放了一个甲板，内部分成两个船舱，船舱内有两条长凳，也可以用来做橱柜。桅杆的底部支撑着两个船舱之间的隔板，通过两个舱口就可以到达甲板。","A deck was placed over this ballast, and the interior was divided into two cabins; two benches extended along them and served also as lockers.The foot of the mast supported the partition which separated the two cabins, which were reached by two hatchways let into the deck."
"潘克洛夫没费多大劲，就找到了一棵适合做桅杆的树。他选择了一棵没有节的、很直的小枞树，只要把桅杆的底部砍成方的，顶部砍成圆的就可以了。桅杆、船舵和船身的铁工都是在“石窟”里锻造的，虽然粗糙，但很结实。最终，在十月的第一个星期，帆架、桅杆、帆杠、圆杆和桨等都做好了，大家一致同意环岛做一次试航，以确定船在海上的航行性能，以及能够利用它航行的距离。","Pencroft had no trouble in finding a tree suitable for the mast.He chose a straight young fir, with no knots, and which he had only to square at the step, and round off at the top.The ironwork of the mast, the rudder and the hull had been roughly but strongly forged at the Chimneys.Lastly, yards, masts, boom, spars, oars, etc., were all furnished by the first week in October, and it was agreed that a trial trip should be taken round the island, so as to ascertain how the vessel would behave at sea, and how far they might depend upon her."
"在这期间，一切必要的工作都没有被忽视。摩佛仑羊和山羊增添了很多小羊羔，又必须给它们吃住，所以就扩大了畜栏。开拓者们也到过牡蛎场、养兔场、煤矿区和铁矿区，还去过一直没有探索过的远西森林，那里的猎物很丰富。他们发现了一些当地的植物，这些植物适合立即使用，于是增加了花岗岩宫的蔬菜储备种类。","During all this time the necessary works had not been neglected.The corral was enlarged, for the flock of musmons and goats had been increased by a number of young ones, who had to be housed and fed.The colonists had paid visits also to the oyster bed, the warren, the coal and iron mines, and to the till then unexplored districts of the Far West forest, which abounded in game.Certain indigenous plants were discovered, and those fit for immediate use contributed to vary the vegetable stores of Granite House."
"这些是番杏科植物，其中有一些和好望角上的那些相似，它们长着可食的肉质叶子，其他的结着籽，里面含有一种淀粉。","They were a species of ficoide, some similar to those of the Cape, with eatable fleshy leaves, others bearing seeds containing a sort of flour."
"10月10日，船下水了。造船工作圆满成功，潘克洛夫喜气洋洋、容光焕发。船上的索具装置完毕，用滑轮把船推到水边，在移民们的欢呼声中，船随着上涨的潮水浮了起来，尤其是潘克洛夫，在这个时候一点都不谦虚。另外，他的重要性不止造完这艘船，因为在这之后，他还要指挥这个船。经过大家一致的同意，他获得了“船长”的称号。为了使潘克洛夫船长满意，现在有必要给这艘船起个名字，经过反复的讨论，大家都同意用“乘风破浪”这个名字。上涨的潮水一把“乘风破浪”浮起来，大家就看到船在水中很平稳，航行起来也很容易。不过，试航工作决定就在当天举行，他们要远离海岸作一次短途旅行。天气晴朗，风平浪静，特别是接近南部海岸一带，因为当时风从西北方向吹来。","On the 10th of October the vessel was launched.Pencroft was radiant with joy, the operation was perfectly successful; the boat completely rigged, having been pushed on rollers to the water’s edge, was floated by the rising tide, amid the cheers of the colonists, particularly of Pencroft, who showed no modesty on this occasion.Besides his importance was to last beyond the finishing of the vessel, since, after having built her, he was to command her.The grade of captain was bestowed upon him with the approbation of all.To satisfy Captain Pencroft, it was now necessary to give a name to the vessel, and, after many propositions had been discussed, the votes were all in favor of the “Bonadventure.”As soon as the “Bonadventure” had been lifted by the rising tide, it was seen that she lay evenly in the water, and would be easily navigated.However, the trial trip was to be made that very day, by an excursion off the coast.The weather was fine, the breeze fresh, and the sea smooth, especially towards the south coast, for the wind was blowing from the northwest."
"“全体上船。”潘克洛夫大喊。但是首先他们必须吃早饭，他们认为最好在船上备用一些食物，因为这次航行有可能延迟到晚上。","“All hands on board,” shouted Pencroft; but breakfast was first necessary, and it was thought best to take provisions on board, in the event of their excursion being prolonged until the evening."
"赛勒斯·哈丁同样也急于试一下这艘船，因为这船的模型是他想出来的，虽然根据水手的意见，修改了其中几个部分。但是，他并不像潘克洛夫那样对船有信心，水手后来没有提到达抱岛航行的事情，哈丁希望他已经放弃了这个想法。的确，他非常不愿意让他的两三个伙伴乘着这个载重不超过15吨的小船到那么远的地方去冒险。","Cyrus Harding was equally anxious to try the vessel, the model of which had originated with him, although on the sailor’s advice he had altered some parts of it, but he did not share Pencroft’s confidence in her, and as the latter had not again spoken of the voyage to Tabor Island, Harding hoped he had given it up.He would have indeed great reluctance in letting two or three of his companions venture so far in so small a boat, which was not of more than fifteen tons’ burden."
"十点半的时候，大家都上了船，包括托普和贾普，赫伯特把锚拔了出来，它深深陷入靠近慈悲河口的沙里。他们扬起了船帆，桅杆上的林肯号国旗在空中飘扬，由潘克洛夫驾驶的“乘风破浪”号径自驶向海里。","At half-past ten everybody was on board, even Top and Jup, and Herbert weighed the anchor, which was fast in the sand near the mouth of the Mercy.The sail was hoisted, the Lincolnian flag floated from the masthead, and the “Bonadventure,” steered by Pencroft, stood out to sea."
"船顺着从联合湾吹来的风向前行驶，用潘克洛夫的话说就是，它有跑得异常飞快的脚后跟，所以船的主人们看到这种情形，感到非常满意。绕过遗物角和爪角后，船长快速转变方向，使船沿着荒岛的南部海岸航行。这时候可以看出，船刚好在风的的五个方位内顺利航行。船上全体人员都很高兴，他们有艘好船，必要的时候，会给他们很大的帮助。如果天气良好，加上阵阵清风，航海一定会很顺利。","The wind blowing out of Union Bay she ran before it, and thus showed her owners, much to their satisfaction, that she possessed a remarkably fast pair of heels, according to Pencroft’s mode of speaking.After having doubled Flotsam Point and Claw Cape, the captain kept her close hauled, so as to sail along the southern coast of the island, when it was found she sailed admirably within five points of the wind.All hands were enchanted, they had a good vessel, which, in case of need, would be of great service to them, and with fine weather and a fresh breeze the voyage promised to be charming."
"潘克洛夫现在使船离岸行驶，距离气球港有三四英里。这时候，大家看到了海岛的全貌。海岛呈现出全新的景象，沿岸地带，从爪角到爬虫角，景色变化不一，森林里枞树的深绿色与其他树木的鲜绿色形成对比，俯瞰一切，富兰克林山高耸的顶峰还覆盖着皑皑白雪。","Pencroft now stood off the shore, three or four miles across from Port Balloon.The island then appeared in all its extent and under a new aspect, with the varied panorama of its shore from Claw Cape to Reptile End, the forests in which dark firs contrasted with the young foliage of other trees and overlooked the whole, and Mount Franklin whose lofty head was still whitened with snow."
"“太漂亮了！”赫伯特大喊。","“How beautiful it is!” cried Herbert."
"“是的，我们的岛屿既漂亮又舒适，”潘克洛夫说，“我爱它就像爱我那可怜的母亲。我们刚来时贫困潦倒，现在，我们这五个从天而降的人还有什么缺的呢？”","“Yes, our island is beautiful and good,” replied Pencroft.“I love it as I loved my poor mother.It received us poor and destitute, and now what is wanting to us five fellows who fell on it from the sky?”"
"“什么都不缺，”纳布回答，“什么都不缺，船长。”","“Nothing,” replied Neb; “nothing, captain.”"
"这两个勇敢的人大喊三声，向他们的海岛表示敬意！","And the two brave men gave three tremendous cheers in honor of their island!"
"这段时间，吉丁·史佩莱一直倚靠着桅杆，为展现在他眼前的全景绘制草图。","During all this time Gideon Spilett, leaning against the mast, sketched the panorama which was developed before his eyes."
"赛勒斯·哈丁默默地注视着。","Cyrus Harding gazed on it in silence."
"“嗯，哈丁上尉，”潘克洛夫问，“你觉得我们的船怎么样啊？”","“Well, Captain Harding,” asked Pencroft, “what do you think of our vessel?”"
"“好像航行得很好。”工程师回答。","“She appears to behave well,” replied the engineer."
"“好！现在你认为它能够作一定距离的航行吗？”","“Good!And do you think now that she could undertake a voyage of some extent?”"
"“什么航行，潘克洛夫？”","“What voyage, Pencroft?”"
"“比如说，去达抱岛。”","“One to Tabor Island, for instance.”"
"“我的朋友，”哈丁回答说，“如果情况紧急，确有必要，我们会毫不犹豫地信任‘乘风破浪’号，作更远的航行，不过你知道让你们去达抱岛，我是很不放心的，因为根本没有必要非去不可。”","“My friend,” replied Harding, “I think that in any pressing emergency we need not hesitate to trust ourselves to the ‘Bonadventure’ even for a longer voyage; but you know I should see you set off to Tabor Island with great uneasiness, since nothing obliges you to go there.”"
"“每个人都想了解一下自己的邻居，”水手说，他还是固执己见。“达抱岛是我们的邻居，而且是唯一的邻居！出于礼貌，我们至少也应该去拜访一次。”","“One likes to know one’s neighbors,” returned the sailor, who was obstinate in his idea.“Tabor Island is our neighbor, and the only one!Politeness requires us to go at least to pay a visit.”"
"“哎呀，”史佩莱说，“我们的朋友潘克洛夫怎么突然间特别讲究礼节了啊！”","“By Jove,” said Spilett, “our friend Pencroft has become very particular about the proprieties all at once!”"
"“我对任何事情都一点不讲究。”水手反驳说，他因为工程师的反对而非常生气，但是他又不想让工程师替他担忧。","“I am not particular about anything at all,” retorted the sailor, who was rather vexed by the engineer’s opposition, but who did not wish to cause him anxiety."
"“想一下，潘克洛夫，”哈丁继续说，“你不能一个人去达抱岛。”","“Consider, Pencroft,” resumed Harding, “you cannot go alone to Tabor Island.”"
"“我只需要一个同伴就够了。”","“One companion will be enough for me.”"
"“就算是这样，”工程师说，“你这样做，来林肯岛的五个居民就有减少两个的危险。”","“Even so,” replied the engineer, “you will risk depriving the colony of Lincoln Island of two settlers out of five.”"
"“六个居民，”潘克洛夫回答，“你忘记贾普了。”","“Out of six,” answered Pencroft; “you forget Jup.”"
"“是七个，”纳布补充说，“托普也应该算上。”","“Out of seven,” added Neb; “Top is quite worth another.”"
"“这个航行根本没有危险，上尉。”潘克洛夫回答说。","“There is no risk at all in it, captain,” replied Pencroft."
"“还是有可能的，潘克洛夫，可是我再重复一遍，这样冒险是没有必要的。”","“That is possible, Pencroft; but I repeat it is to expose ourselves uselessly.”"
"固执的水手没有回答，谈话也暂停下来，他决定以后再继续谈论这个问题。可是，他毫不怀疑，接下来要发生的事情会帮助他，并且使最初不过是一种饱受怀疑的突发奇想变成了一件不得不做的事情。","The obstinate sailor did not reply, and let the conversation drop, quite determined to resume it again.But he did not suspect that an incident would come to his aid and change into an act of humanity that which was at first only a doubtful whim."
"离岸航行一会儿后，“乘风破浪”又继续向着气球港的方向驶去。重要的是要弄清楚沙洲和礁石之间的海峡，必要时要设置浮标，因为小溪将用来作为港口。","After standing off the shore the “Bonadventure” again approached it in the direction of Port Balloon.It was important to ascertain the channels between the sandbanks and reefs, that buoys might be laid down since this little creek was to be the harbor."
"他们离海岸不超过半英里，必须迎着风抢风而行。由于一部分微风被高地挡住了，“乘风破浪”号的航行速度非常慢，帆也很少鼓起来。海面平静得像镜子一样，海风吹过时，才偶尔荡起丝丝涟漪。","They were not more than half a mile from the coast, and it was necessary to tack to beat against the wind.The “Bonadventure” was then going at a very moderate rate, as the breeze, partly intercepted by the high land, scarcely swelled her sails, and the sea, smooth as glass, was only rippled now and then by passing gusts."
"赫伯特一直站在船头，指挥着船在海峡中航行的路线，突然，他大喊：","Herbert had stationed himself in the bows that he might indicate the course to be followed among the channels, when all at once he shouted,—"
"“向着风行驶，潘克洛夫，向着风！”","“Luff, Pencroft, luff!”"
"“怎么回事，”水手回答说，“有礁石吗？”","“What’s the matter,” replied the sailor; “a rock?”"
"“不——等一会儿，”赫伯特说，“我看得不是很清楚。再向着风，现在往右。”","“No—wait,” said Herbert; “I don’t quite see.Luff again—right—now.”"
"赫伯特一边说，一遍侧身，把手伸进水中，捞出一样东西，叫道：","So saying, Herbert, leaning over the side, plunged his arm into the water, and pulled it out, exclaiming,—"
"“一个瓶子！”","“A bottle!”"
"他手里拿着一个塞着软木塞的瓶子，拣起这个瓶子的地方离海岸只有几锚链远。","He held in his hand a corked bottle which he had just seized a few cables’ length from the shore."
"赛勒斯·哈丁拿过瓶子。他一言不发，拔开瓶塞，从里面拿出一张潮湿的纸，上面写着：","Cyrus Harding took the bottle.Without uttering a single word he drew the cork, and took from it a damp paper, on which were written these words:—"
"“落难者……达抱岛：西经153度，南纬37度11分。”","“Castaway....Tabor island: 153deg W. long., 37deg 11’ S. lat.”"
"第十三章","Chapter 13"
"“一个遇难者!”潘克洛夫喊道，“流落到达抱岛上了，离我们不到200英里！啊，哈丁上尉，现在你不会反对我去了吧。”","“A castaway!” exclaimed Pencroft; “left on this Tabor Island not two hundred miles from us!Ah, Captain Harding, you won’t now oppose my going.”"
"“是的，潘克洛夫，”赛勒斯·哈丁回答说，“你尽快出发吧。”","“No, Pencroft,” replied Cyrus Harding; “and you shall set out as soon as possible.”"
"“明天怎样？”","“To-morrow?”"
"“就明天吧！”","“To-morrow!”"
"工程师手里还拿着从瓶子中取出的纸。他沉思了一会，然后接着说：","The engineer still held in his hand the paper which he had taken from the bottle.He contemplated it for some instants, then resumed,"
"“朋友们，从这张纸上，从它的措辞上，我们可以得出以下结论：第一，达抱岛上的这个遇难者具有相当丰富的航海知识，因为他给出的达抱岛经纬度与我们测量出来的完全一样，并且他连大约的分度也算出来了；第二，他不是英国人就是美国人，因为上面的文字是英文。”","“From this document, my friends, from the way in which it is worded, we may conclude this: first, that the castaway on Tabor Island is a man possessing a considerable knowledge of navigation, since he gives the latitude and longitude of the island exactly as we ourselves found it, and to a second of approximation; secondly, that he is either English or American, as the document is written in the English language.”"
"“这完全符合逻辑，”史佩莱回答，“这落难者的出现，解释了我们岛上海岸边那个箱子的由来。既然有遇难者，就一定有遇难的船只。潘克洛夫想要造这船，并且就在今天试航，对于这个落难者来说，不管他是谁，都是他的运气，因为如果再晚一天，瓶子有可能撞碎在岩石上。","“That is perfectly logical,” answered Spilett; “and the presence of this castaway explains the arrival of the case on the shores of our island.There must have been a wreck, since there is a castaway.As to the latter, whoever he may be, it is lucky for him that Pencroft thought of building this boat and of trying her this very day, for a day later and this bottle might have been broken on the rocks.”"
"“的确，”赫伯特说，“碰巧的是，‘乘风破浪’号正好从瓶子漂浮的地方经过！”","“Indeed,” said Herbert, “it is a fortunate chance that the ‘Bonadventure’ passed exactly where the bottle was still floating!”"
"“你觉得这件事奇怪吗？”哈丁问潘克洛夫。","“Does not this appear strange to you?” asked Harding of Pencroft."
"“似乎是运气好，仅此而已，”水手回答，“上尉，你发现这件事奇怪的地方了吗？瓶子总是要漂到一个地方的，其他地方和这里不一样吗？”","“It appears fortunate, that’s all,” answered the sailor.“Do you see anything extraordinary in it, captain?The bottle must go somewhere, and why not here as well as anywhere else?”"
"“也许你是对的，潘克洛夫，”工程师说，“不过……”","“Perhaps you are right, Pencroft,” replied the engineer; “and yet—”"
"“可是，”赫伯特说，“也不能证明瓶子已经在海上漂了很久了。”","“But,” observed Herbert, “there’s nothing to prove that this bottle has been floating long in the sea.”"
"“是啊，”吉丁·史佩莱说，“这张纸好像是最近才写的。你怎么看呢，赛勒斯？”","“Nothing,” replied Gideon Spilett, “and the document appears even to have been recently written.What do you think about it, Cyrus?”"
"谈话的时候，潘克洛夫并没有闲着。他掉转船头，扬起船帆，飞速向爪角驶去。","During this conversation Pencroft had not remained inactive.He had put the vessel about, and the “Bonadventure,” all sails set, was running rapidly towards Claw Cape."
"每个人都在想着达抱岛上的那个落难者。他们救他还来得及吗？对这群开拓者的生活来说，这可是一件大事！他们自己本来就是落难者，但换作是其他人，恐怕就不会如此幸运了，他们的责任就是去救他。","Every one was thinking of the castaway on Tabor Island.Should they be in time to save him?This was a great event in the life of the colonists!They themselves were but castaways, but it was to be feared that another might not have been so fortunate, and their duty was to go to his succor."
"他们绕过爪角，大约四点钟的时候，“乘风破浪”号在慈悲河口抛锚了。","Claw Cape was doubled, and about four o’clock the “Bonadventure” dropped her anchor at the mouth of the Mercy."
"也就是当天晚上，他们制定了新的远征安排。看来，得由潘克洛夫和赫伯特承担这次航行，因为他们懂得怎样行船。如果第二天，也就是10月10日出发，10月13日就能到达，因为以目前的风向来看，航行150英里的路程用不了48个小时。在岛上呆一天，回来需要三四天，因此，他们希望在10月17号再回到林肯岛。天气晴朗，温度上升，风向似乎也稳定，一切都有利于这两个勇敢的人远离海岛的进行人道援助。","That same evening the arrangements for the new expedition were made.It appeared best that Pencroft and Herbert, who knew how to work the vessel, should undertake the voyage alone.By setting out the next day, the 10th of October, they would arrive on the 13th, for with the present wind it would not take more than forty-eight hours to make this passage of a hundred and fifty miles.One day in the island, three or four to return, they might hope therefore that on the 17th they would again reach Lincoln Island.The weather was fine, the barometer was rising, the wind appeared settled, everything then was in favor of these brave men whom an act of humanity was taking far from their island."
"大家一致决定，赛勒斯·哈丁、纳布和吉丁·史佩莱留在花岗岩宫，但是史佩莱提出了反对意见，他没有忘记作为《纽约先驱报》记者的任务，他表示自己宁愿游过去，也不愿错过这样一个机会，于是大家同意他参加这次航行。","Thus it had been agreed that Cyrus Harding, Neb, and Gideon Spilett should remain at Granite House, but an objection was raised, and Spilett, who had not forgotten his business as reporter to the New York Herald, having declared that he would go by swimming rather than lose such an opportunity, he was admitted to take a part in the voyage."
"晚上，大家都忙着往船上搬运东西，有铺盖、器皿、武器、弹药、指南针以及够吃一周的粮食，这些工作很快完成后，开拓者们就上到花岗岩宫去了。","The evening was occupied in transporting on board the “Bonadventure,” articles of bedding, utensils, arms, ammunition, a compass, provisions for a week; this being rapidly done, the colonists ascended to Granite House."
"第二天清晨五点钟，大家互相告别，心中都有些依依不舍，潘克洛夫扬起风帆，向爪角驶去，他们必须绕过爪角，为了向西南方前进。","The next day, at five o’clock in the morning, the farewells were said, not without some emotion on both sides, and Pencroft setting sail made towards Claw Cape, which had to be doubled in order to proceed to the southwest."
"已经离岸四分之一英里了，“乘风破浪”号上的乘客看见花岗岩宫的高地上还有两个人在和他们挥手，这两人是赛勒斯·哈丁和纳布。","The “Bonadventure” was already a quarter of a mile from the coast when the passengers perceived on the heights of Granite House two men waving their farewells; they were Cyrus Harding and Neb."
"“朋友们，”史佩莱喊道，“这是15个月来，我们第一次分开。”","“Our friends,” exclaimed Spilett, “this is our first separation in fifteen months.”"
"潘克洛夫、记者和赫伯特也向他们挥手，不一会儿，花岗岩宫就消失在爪角高高的岩后面了。","Pencroft, the reporter and Herbert waved in return, and Granite House soon disappeared behind the high rocks of the Cape."
"这一天上午，“乘风破浪”号还在林肯岛的南部海岸一带行驶，很快林肯岛看起来就像是一个绿色的篮子，富兰克林山从中间耸起。从远处看，高度不是很高，吸引不住过往船只的注意。走了大约一个小时，就过了爬虫角，虽然只是在约十英里的地方。","During the first part of the day the “Bonadventure” was still in sight of the southern coast of Lincoln Island, which soon appeared just like a green basket, with Mount Franklin rising from the center.The heights, diminished by distance, did not present an appearance likely to tempt vessels to touch there.Reptile End was passed in about an hour, though at a distance of about ten miles."
"现在，再也看不到一直延伸到富兰克林山脊的西海岸了，三个小时后，林肯岛最后的景象也沉在水平线以下了。","At this distance it was no longer possible to distinguish anything of the Western Coast, which stretched away to the ridges of Mount Franklin, and three hours after the last of Lincoln Island sank below the horizon."
"“乘风破浪”号航行得很好。它在波浪上跳动，快速在航线上前进。潘克洛夫升起前桅的风帆，依靠指南针，直线行驶。赫伯特时不时得和他轮流掌舵，少年的手非常牢固，水手挑不出一点毛病来。","The “Bonadventure” behaved capitally.Bounding over the waves she proceeded rapidly on her course.Pencroft had hoisted the foresail, and steering by the compass followed a rectilinear direction.From time to time Herbert relieved him at the helm, and the lad’s hand was so firm that the sailor had not a point to find fault with."
"吉丁·史佩莱一会儿和这个说说话，一会儿和那个说说，必要的时候，他会帮着照看下绳索，潘克洛夫船长对他的船员非常满意。","Gideon Spilett chatted sometimes with one, sometimes with the other, if wanted he lent a hand with the ropes, and Captain Pencroft was perfectly satisfied with his crew."
"傍晚时分，一弯新月出现在暮色中，很快就落下去了，直到16日，才能看到上玄月。夜色苍茫，但繁星满天，第二天一定是好天气。","In the evening the crescent moon, which would not be in its first quarter until the 16th, appeared in the twilight and soon set again.The night was dark but starry, and the next day again promised to be fine."
"潘克洛夫小心地降下风帆，他不想在满帆的情况下遭到暴风的突袭。夜晚很安静，这个预防措施可能是没有必要的，但是潘克洛夫是一个谨慎的水手，不能因此责怪他。","Pencroft prudently lowered the foresail, not wishing to be caught by a sudden gust while carrying too much canvas; it was perhaps an unnecessary precaution on such a calm night, but Pencroft was a prudent sailor and cannot be blamed for it."
"记者睡了半夜。潘克洛夫和赫伯特轮流掌舵，每两小时换一次班。水手相信赫伯特就像相信自己一样，少年的冷静和判断证明他的自信是正确的。潘克洛夫像船长一样指挥着舵手，赫伯特从来没有让“乘风破浪”号航行时有任何偏差。夜晚很快就过去了，10月12日的白天也是这样。他们严格按照东南方向行驶。如果“乘风破浪”号不遇到一些未知的海流，那么它将正好处在达抱岛的视线之内。","The reporter slept part of the night.Pencroft and Herbert took turns for a spell of two hours each at the helm.The sailor trusted Herbert as he would himself, and his confidence was justified by the coolness and judgment of the lad.Pencroft gave him his directions as a commander to his steersman, and Herbert never allowed the “Bonadventure” to swerve even a point.The night passed quickly, as did the day of the 12th of October.A south-easterly direction was strictly maintained.Unless the “Bonadventure” fell in with some unknown current she would come exactly within sight of Tabor Island."
"在他们当时一路经过的海面上，一片荒凉。偶尔有大的信天翁或军舰鸟在射程范围内飞行，吉丁·史佩莱特就想，这是否是他上次用来给《纽约先驱报》带信的那只？在达抱岛和林肯岛之间的海域，似乎只有这些鸟经常在这一带飞行。","As to the sea over which the vessel was then sailing, it was absolutely deserted.Now and then a great albatross or frigate bird passed within gunshot, and Gideon Spilett wondered if it was to one of them that he had confided his last letter addressed to the New York Herald.These birds were the only beings that appeared to frequent this part of the ocean between Tabor and Lincoln Islands."
"“可是，”赫伯特说，“这个时候，捕鲸船经常到南太平洋一带。事实上，这个地方再荒凉不过了。”","“And yet,” observed Herbert, “this is the time that whalers usually proceed towards the southern part of the Pacific.Indeed I do not think there could be a more deserted sea than this.”"
"“并不像你说的那么荒凉。”潘克洛夫说。","“It is not quite so deserted as all that,” replied Pencroft."
"“你是什么意思？”记者问。","“What do you mean?” asked the reporter."
"“我们现在在海上。难道你把我们的船当作遇难的船，把我们当作是海豚了吗？","“We are on it.Do you take our vessel for a wreck and us for porpoises?”"
"潘克洛夫一边说着，一边大笑。","And Pencroft laughed at his joke."
"傍晚时候，他们估计，自“乘风破浪”号离开林肯岛以来，也就是说在36个小时内，他们行驶了120海里，它的时速是3海里到4海里之间。此刻风很小，而且有可能很快就要停下来。尽管这样，如果他们估计准确并且航线正确，明天早上破晓的时候，他们就能看到达抱岛。","By the evening, according to calculation, it was thought that the “Bonadventure” had accomplished a distance of a hundred and twenty miles since her departure from Lincoln Island, that is to say in thirty-six hours, which would give her a speed of between three and four knots an hour.The breeze was very slight and might soon drop altogether.However, it was hoped that the next morning by break of day, if the calculation had been correct and the course true, they would sight Tabor Island."
"这一夜，吉丁·史佩莱、赫伯特和潘克洛夫都没有睡。他们期待着明天的到来，心里难免有些激动。他们这次冒险充满未知数！他们是不是要靠近达抱岛了呢？他们要救的那个遇难者还在这个岛上吗？这个人是谁？他的出现会不会打破这个开拓地一向的团结呢？另外，他愿不愿意换个困守的地方呢？毫无疑问，这些问题第二天都能找到答案，然而他们却静不下心来。第二天黎明，所有人都注视着西边的地平线。","Neither Gideon Spilett, Herbert, nor Pencroft slept that night.In the expectation of the next day they could not but feel some emotion.There was so much uncertainty in their enterprise!Were they near Tabor Island?Was the island still inhabited by the castaway to whose succor they had come?Who was this man?Would not his presence disturb the little colony till then so united?Besides, would he be content to exchange his prison for another?All these questions, which would no doubt be answered the next day, kept them in suspense, and at the dawn of day they all fixed their gaze on the western horizon."
"“陆地！”早上大约六点钟的时候，潘克洛夫大喊。","“Land!” shouted Pencroft at about six o’clock in the morning."
"潘克洛夫不可能错，显然那边就是陆地。想象一下，“乘风破浪”号上的小队船员们有多么高兴。再过几个小时，他们就可以登上这个岛屿的海滩了！","And it was impossible that Pencroft should be mistaken, it was evident that land was there.Imagine the joy of the little crew of the “Bonadventure.”In a few hours they would land on the beach of the island!"
"达抱岛海岸很低，仅比海平面高出一点，现在离他们还有不到15海里。","The low coast of Tabor Island, scarcely emerging from the sea, was not more than fifteen miles distant."
"“乘风破浪”号的头部直接对着达抱岛行驶，位置稍微偏向岛的南部，太阳从东方升起，光辉洒在一两个海角上。","The head of the “Bonadventure,” which was a little to the south of the island, was set directly towards it, and as the sun mounted in the east, its rays fell upon one or two headlands."
"“这个岛要比林肯岛小得多，”赫伯特说，“大概和我们的岛屿一样，都是由海底地震形成的。”","“This is a much less important isle than Lincoln Island,” observed Herbert, “and is probably due like ours to some submarine convulsion.”"
"晚上十一点的时候，“乘风破浪”号离海岸不到两海里了，潘克洛夫一边寻找适合登陆的地方，一边小心翼翼地在陌生的海面上行驶。现在可以看清楚整个岛屿了，也可以看到岛上丛生的橡胶树以及其他种类的大树，这些品种与林肯岛上的那些一样。但是，令人惊讶的是岛上没有一缕显示人类居住的炊烟，整个岛上看起来没有人居住的迹象。","At eleven o’clock the “Bonadventure” was not more than two miles off, and Pencroft, while looking for a suitable place at which to land, proceeded very cautiously through the unknown waters.The whole of the island could now be surveyed, and on it could be seen groups of gum and other large trees, of the same species as those growing on Lincoln Island.But the astonishing thing was that no smoke arose to show that the island was inhabited, no signal whatever appeared on the shore!"
"然而，纸条上写得很清楚，这里有一个落难的人，而且这个人一定在密切注意着。","And yet the document was clear enough; there was a castaway, and this castaway should have been on the watch."
"这时候，“乘风破浪”号穿过礁石，驶入弯弯曲曲的海峡，潘克洛夫十分小心地注意着每一个弯曲部分。他让赫伯特掌舵，自己站在船头，观察着海水，手握升降索，随时准备降帆。吉丁·史佩莱用望眼镜焦急地看了一下海面，可是什么都没有发现。","In the meanwhile the “Bonadventure” entered the winding channels among the reefs, and Pencroft observed every turn with extreme care.He had put Herbert at the helm, posting himself in the bows, inspecting the water, while he held the halliard in his hand, ready to lower the sail at a moment’s notice.Gideon Spilett with his glass eagerly scanned the shore, though without perceiving anything."
"大约十二点的时候，“乘风破浪”号的船身终于碰到陆地了。水手们抛下船锚，收起帆，然后这小队船员登陆。","However, at about twelve o’clock the keel of the “Bonadventure” grated on the bottom.The anchor was let go, the sails furled, and the crew of the little vessel landed."
"毫无疑问，这就是达抱岛，因为根据最新的海图，在新西兰和美洲之间这一带的海域，没有其他的岛屿了。","And there was no reason to doubt that this was Tabor Island, since according to the most recent charts there was no island in this part of the Pacific between New Zealand and the American Coast."
"他们把船牢牢地系好，这样船就没有被落潮冲走的危险了，然后潘克洛夫和他的同伴们全副武装，跳上海岸，打算爬到半英里外海拔250英尺到300英尺的地方去。","The vessel was securely moored, so that there should be no danger of her being carried away by the receding tide; then Pencroft and his companions, well armed, ascended the shore, so as to gain an elevation of about two hundred and fifty or three hundred feet which rose at a distance of half a mile."
"“从山顶上看，”史佩莱说，“毫无疑问，我们能够看到这个岛的全景，这会极大地方便我们寻找。”","“From the summit of that hill,” said Spilett, “we can no doubt obtain a complete view of the island, which will greatly facilitate our search.”"
"赫伯特回答说：“哈丁上尉在林肯岛上做的第一件事就是爬上富兰克林山，这里也是如此。”","“So as to do here,” replied Herbert, “that which Captain Harding did the very first thing on Lincoln Island, by climbing Mount Franklin.”"
"“确实如此，”记者说，“这也是最好的计划。”","“Exactly so,” answered the reporter, “and it is the best plan.”"
"因此，这些探险者们一边说着，一边沿着山脚下的一块空地前进。成群的石鸽子和海燕在他们周围来回飞旋，它们与林肯岛上的那些相似。在左边林间空地的树下，他们能够听到灌木丛中沙沙的声音，看到小草来回摆动，这些迹象表明树林中有胆小的动物，但还是没有一丝迹象表明有人居住在这个岛上。","While thus talking the explorers had advanced along a clearing which terminated at the foot of the hill.Flocks of rock-pigeons and sea-swallows, similar to those of Lincoln Island, fluttered around them.Under the woods which skirted the glade on the left they could hear the bushes rustling and see the grass waving, which indicated the presence of timid animals, but still nothing to show that the island was inhabited."
"到达山脚下后，潘克洛夫、史佩莱和赫伯特几分钟就爬了上去，惴惴不安地注视着地平线。","Arrived at the foot of the hill, Pencroft, Spilett, and Herbert climbed it in a few minutes, and gazed anxiously round the horizon."
"他们所在的小岛，圆周不超过六英里，边缘的海角、海岬，或是海湾、溪流不多，形状就像一个拉长的椭圆。岛的四周，只有荒凉的大海延伸到地平线的尽头。看不见任何陆地甚至船只。","They were on an islet, which did not measure more than six miles in circumference, its shape not much bordered by capes or promontories, bays or creeks, being a lengthened oval.All around, the lonely sea extended to the limits of the horizon.No land nor even a sail was in sight."
"这个小岛虽然树木丛生，但地理特征却不像林肯岛那样丰富，林肯岛上有一部分寸草不生、一片荒凉，其他地方却土地肥沃、资源丰富。相反，这里一片翠绿，中间会升起两、三座不是很高的小山。椭圆形小岛的侧面，有水流从广阔的草地中流出，又通过西部一个狭窄的出口落入大海。","This woody islet did not offer the varied aspects of Lincoln Island, arid and wild in one part, but fertile and rich in the other.On the contrary this was a uniform mass of verdure, out of which rose two or three hills of no great height.Obliquely to the oval of the island ran a stream through a wide meadow falling into the sea on the west by a narrow mouth."
"“地方太小了。”赫伯特说。","“The domain is limited,” said Herbert."
"“是啊，”潘克洛夫又回答说，“对我们来说太小了。”","“Yes,” rejoined Pencroft: “It would have been too small for us.”"
"“另外，”记者说，“这看上去好像没有人居住。”","“And moreover,” said the reporter, “it appears to be uninhabited.”"
"“的确是这样，”赫伯特回答说，“这里没有一样东西能够显露出有人存在。”","“Indeed,” answered Herbert, “nothing here betrays the presence of man.”"
"“我们继续往下走，接着寻找吧。”潘克洛夫说。","“Let us go down,” said Pencroft, “and search.”"
"水手和他的两个同伴回到了海岸上，也就是他们离开“乘风破浪”号的地方。","The sailor and his two companions returned to the shore, to the place where they had left the “Bonadventure.”"
"在探索岛的内部以前，他们决定徒步游览这个小岛，这样一个地点都不会遗漏在他们的调查中。海滩很容易走，只是在某些地方，有大岩石挡住他们的道路，但是他们很容易就绕过了。这些探险者们向南走，途中惊动了无数的海鸟和成群的海豹，它们看到远处有陌生人出现，就马上钻到海里去了。","They had decided to make the tour of the island on foot, before exploring the interior; so that not a spot should escape their investigations.The beach was easy to follow, and only in some places was their way barred by large rocks, which, however, they easily passed round.The explorers proceeded towards the south, disturbing numerous flocks of sea-birds and herds of seals, which threw themselves into the sea as soon as they saw the strangers at a distance."
"“那边那些野兽可不是第一次见到人类。”记者说。它们怕人，因此他们一定对人类有所了解。","“Those beasts yonder,” observed the reporter, “do not see men for the first time.They fear them, therefore they must know them.”"
"出发一小时后，他们走到了这个小岛的南端，最南端以一个锋利的海角为尾，之后他们又沿着西海岸向北方前进，海岸上一半是沙子一半是岩石，后面的边界上是茂密的树林。","An hour after their departure they arrived on the southern point of the islet, terminated by a sharp cape, and proceeded towards the north along the western coast, equally formed by sand and rocks, the background bordered with thick woods."
"这里没有一个地方显示人居住过的痕迹，也没有人的脚印在小岛的海岸上，他们用了四个小时，在海岸上走了个遍。","There was not a trace of a habitation in any part, not the print of a human foot on the shore of the island, which after four hours’ walking had been gone completely round."
"至少可以说这非常不同寻常，他们也不得不相信，达抱岛以前没有人居住，以后也不会再有人居住。或许这个纸条已经写了几个月或者几年了，这种情况下，落难者可能已经回到了自己的国家，也可能不幸死去了。","It was to say the least very extraordinary, and they were compelled to believe that Tabor Island was not or was no longer inhabited.Perhaps, after all the document was already several months or several years old, and it was possible in this case, either that the castaway had been enabled to return to his country, or that he had died of misery."
"潘克洛夫、史佩莱以及赫伯特或多或少猜测出几种可能，他们急匆匆地在“乘风破浪”号上吃了饭，以便能够在夜晚来临前继续远足。晚上五点的时候，他们就结束了，进入了树林。","Pencroft, Spilett, and Herbert, forming more or less probable conjectures, dined rapidly on board the “Bonadventure” so as to be able to continue their excursion until nightfall.This was done at five o’clock in the evening, at which hour they entered the wood."
"大量的动物在他们接近时就逃散了，可以说它们主要是山羊和猪，很显然这些动物都是欧洲品种。","Numerous animals fled at their approach, being principally, one might say, only goats and pigs, which were obviously European species."
"毫无疑问，是某个捕鲸船把他们带到这个岛上的，它们的数量也迅速增加。赫伯特决定捉一两只活的带回林肯岛。","Doubtless some whaler had landed them on the island, where they had rapidly increased.Herbert resolved to catch one or two living, and take them back to Lincoln Island."
"已经毫无疑问的是，人类在某个时间已经来过这个小岛，而且更明显的是，森林中的小路看起来被踩踏过，还有砍伐的树枝，每到一处都有人类用手动过的痕迹。但是，这些树木已经腐烂了，也许是很多年前砍伐的，斧子砍过的痕迹上还有天鹅绒状的苔藓，路上的小草也长高了，变浓密了，所以很难找到道路。","It was no longer doubtful that men at some period or other had visited this islet, and this became still more evident when paths appeared trodden through the forest, felled trees, and everywhere traces of the hand of man; but the trees were becoming rotten, and had been felled many years ago; the marks of the axe were velveted with moss, and the grass grew long and thick on the paths, so that it was difficult to find them."
"“可是，这证明了不仅已经有人登陆了这个小岛，并且他们已经在这儿住了一段时间。”吉丁·史佩莱说，“那么，这些人到底是谁？他们还有多少人留在这里呢？”","“But,” observed Gideon Spilett, “this not only proves that men have landed on the island, but also that they lived on it for some time.Now, who were these men?How many of them remain?”"
"“那张纸条上说就只有一个落难者。”赫伯特说。","“The document,” said Herbert, “only spoke of one castaway.”"
"“嗯，如果他还在这个岛上，那就不可能找不到他。”潘克洛夫说。","“Well, if he is still on the island,” replied Pencroft, “it is impossible but that we shall find him.”"
"他们继续探索。水手和他的同伴们自然地顺着与小岛斜对角的小路前进，他们只得沿着流入大海的河流前行。","The exploration was continued.The sailor and his companions naturally followed the route which cut diagonally across the island, and they were thus obliged to follow the stream which flowed towards the sea."
"如果这些动物是欧洲品种，如果这些工程是人手的杰作，那无可置疑地证明了人类已经踏足这个小岛，几种蔬菜的样本也证明了这一点。很显然，在空地中的某个地方，土壤中已经种上了厨房里烹调用的植物，很可能是在同样久远的时代。","If the animals of European origin, if works due to a human hand, showed incontestably that men had already visited the island, several specimens of the vegetable kingdom did not prove it less.In some places, in the midst of clearings, it was evident that the soil had been planted with culinary plants, at probably the same distant period."
"接下来令赫伯特高兴的是，他认出来那是土豆、菊苣、掌叶大黄、胡萝卜、卷心菜和萝卜，收集它们的种子足够丰富林肯岛的土地。","What, then, was Herbert’s joy, when he recognized potatoes, chicory, sorrel, carrots, cabbages, and turnips, of which it was sufficient to collect the seed to enrich the soil of Lincoln Island."
"“太好，真开心！”潘克洛夫大喊，“这适合纳布，同样也适合我们。即使我们没有找到落难者，至少我们的航行也不会毫无意义，上帝会奖赏我们的。”","“Capital, jolly!” exclaimed Pencroft.“That will suit Neb as well as us.Even if we do not find the castaway, at least our voyage will not have been useless, and God will have rewarded us.”"
"“肯定是的，”吉丁·史佩莱特回答，“可是，从我们找到的这些植物栽植的状态来看，我担心这个岛已经有一段时间没有人居住了。”","“Doubtless,” replied Gideon Spilett, “but to see the state in which we find these plantations, it is to be feared that the island has not been inhabited for some time.”"
"“确实是这样，不管这个人是谁，他不会将如此重要的农作物置之不理的！”赫伯特回答。","“Indeed,” answered Herbert, “an inhabitant, whoever he was, could not have neglected such an important culture!”"
"“是的，”潘克洛夫说，“落难者已经走了。”","“Yes,” said Pencroft, “the castaway has gone.”"
"“我们只能这样假设了。”","“We must suppose so.”"
"“我们只好认为纸条是很久以前写的了，是吗？”","“It must then be admitted that the document has already a distant date?”"
"“当然了。”","“Evidently.”"
"“这个瓶子是在海上漂流了很长时间才到达林肯岛的。”","“And that the bottle only arrived at Lincoln Island after having floated in the sea a long time.”"
"“那有什么不可呢？”潘克洛夫回应，“可是天就要黑了，我认为现在最好放弃寻找。”","“Why not?” returned Pencroft.“But night is coming on,” added he, “and I think that it will be best to give up the search for the present.”"
"“我们先回船吧，明天我们重新开始。”记者说。","“Let us go on board, and to-morrow we will begin again,” said the reporter."
"这是最明智的做法，当他们要走的时候，赫伯特指着树林中杂乱的一堆，大喊：","This was the wisest course, and it was about to be followed when Herbert, pointing to a confused mass among the trees, exclaimed,—"
"“一所房子！”","“A hut!”"
"三个人立刻一起向房子冲去。暮色中，他们只能看出房屋是用木板钉成的，上面盖着一层厚厚的防水布。","All three immediately ran towards the dwelling.In the twilight it was just possible to see that it was built of planks and covered with a thick tarpaulin."
"潘克洛夫快步冲过去，推开半掩的门。","The half-closed door was pushed open by Pencroft, who entered with a rapid step."
"房子里空无一人！","The hut was empty!"
"第十四章","Chapter 14"
"潘克洛夫、赫伯特和吉丁·史佩莱在黑暗中保持着沉默。","Pencroft, Herbert, and Gideon Spilett remained silent in the midst of the darkness."
"潘克洛夫大声喊叫起来。","Pencroft shouted loudly."
"没有人回应。","No reply was made."
"接着，水手打出了火光，点燃了一根小树枝。火光亮了一分钟，借着亮光，他们发现房子里完全是空的。房间后面是一个简陋的壁炉，上面带有些许冷煤渣，煤渣上支起一抱干木柴。潘克洛夫将燃烧的树枝扔了过去，木柴发出噼里啪啦的声音，接着就发出一道明亮的火光。","The sailor then struck a light and set fire to a twig.This lighted for a minute a small room, which appeared perfectly empty.At the back was a rude fireplace, with a few cold cinders, supporting an armful of dry wood.Pencroft threw the blazing twig on it, the wood crackled and gave forth a bright light."
"水手和他的两个同伴看到一张不整齐的床，上面有一条潮湿并发黄的被单，说明这个床已经很长时间没有人用了。壁炉的角落里,有两个布满铁锈的水壶和一口推翻的锅。衣柜里有几件发霉的水手服，桌子上有一个锡碟和一本《圣经》，不过因潮湿已经侵蚀；角落里有一些工具：一把铁锹，一把镐，两支鸟枪，有一支已经断了；在像一个架子的木板上，摆着一桶仍没有动过的火药，一桶弹药，还有几盒雷管，这些东西上面都落了一层厚厚的灰尘，也许是很多年来堆积下来的。","The sailor and his two companions then perceived a disordered bed, of which the damp and yellow coverlets proved that it had not been used for a long time.In the corner of the fireplace were two kettles, covered with rust, and an overthrown pot.A cupboard, with a few moldy sailor’s clothes; on the table a tin plate and a Bible, eaten away by damp; in a corner a few tools, a spade, pickaxe, two fowling-pieces, one of which was broken; on a plank, forming a shelf, stood a barrel of powder, still untouched, a barrel of shot, and several boxes of caps, all thickly covered with dust, accumulated, perhaps, by many long years."
"“没有一个人在这儿。”记者说。","“There is no one here,” said the reporter."
"“没有人。”潘克洛夫回答。","“No one,” replied Pencroft."
"“这个房子已经很多年没有人居住了。”赫伯特说。","“It is a long time since this room has been inhabited,” observed Herbert."
"“是的，很长时间了！”记者应答。","“Yes, a very long time!” answered the reporter."
"“史佩莱先生，”潘克洛夫说，“我认为我们就不要回到船上了，在这个小屋住一晚会很不错。”","“Mr. Spilett,” then said Pencroft, “instead of returning on board, I think that it would be well to pass the night in this hut.”"
"“你说得对，潘克洛夫，”吉丁·史佩莱回答，“如果房屋的主人回来了，那最好不过了！也许他发现地方被人占了不会不高兴。”","“You are right, Pencroft,” answered Gideon Spilett, “and if its owner returns, well! perhaps he will not be sorry to find the place taken possession of.”"
"“他不会回来的。”水手边摇头边说。","“He will not return,” said the sailor, shaking his head."
"“你认为他已经离开这个岛了吗？”记者问。","“You think that he has quitted the island?” asked the reporter."
"“如果他离开了这个岛，他就会带走他的武器和工具。”潘克洛夫应道，“你知道对于遇难者来说，这些物品的价值，因为这是失事船只最后剩下的东西了。不会的！不会的！”水手用一种确信的语气反复说，“不会的，他还没有离开这个岛！”如果他乘自己造的船逃离了，他也不太有可能将这些不可缺少、又是必备的物品留在这里。不会的！他还在岛上！”","“If he had quitted the island he would have taken away his weapons and his tools,” replied Pencroft.“You know the value which castaways set on such articles as these the last remains of a wreck.No! no!” repeated the sailor, in a tone of conviction; “no, he has not left the island!If he had escaped in a boat made by himself, he would still less have left these indispensable and necessary articles.No! he is on the island!”"
"“活着？”赫伯特问。","“Living?” asked Herbert."
"“活着或者死了。可是如果他死了，我想他并没有埋葬自己，所以我们至少可以找到他的遗体！”","“Living or dead.But if he is dead, I suppose he has not buried himself, and so we shall at least find his remains!”"
"最后他们决定在这个废弃的住所里度过这个夜晚，在角落里找到的一堆木柴足够取暖用了。门关上了，潘克洛夫、赫伯特和史佩莱呆在那里，坐在一个长凳上，彼此之间话很少，但是想的很多。他们的思绪天马行空，任何事情都可以进入他们的想象或期待。他们热切地听着外面的声音。门可能会突然被推开，有一个人会出现在他们面前，他们一点儿也不会吃惊。尽管这个小屋的一切透露着被遗弃的迹象，他们会向这个人，这位遇难者，这位素不认识却等待已久的朋友，伸出手去，与他击掌。","It was then agreed that the night should be passed in the deserted dwelling, and a store of wood found in a corner was sufficient to warm it.The door closed, Pencroft, Herbert and Spilett remained there, seated on a bench, talking little but wondering much.They were in a frame of mind to imagine anything or expect anything.They listened eagerly for sounds outside.The door might have opened suddenly, and a man presented himself to them without their being in the least surprised, notwithstanding all that the hut revealed of abandonment, and they had their hands ready to press the hands of this man, this castaway, this unknown friend, for whom friends were waiting."
"可是，他们没有听到任何声音，门也没有开。时间就这样过去了。","But no voice was heard, the door did not open.The hours thus passed away."
"对于水手和同伴来说，这个夜晚看起来是多么漫长啊！赫伯特自己睡了两个小时，在他这个年龄，睡觉是必须的。他们三个人都迫不及待地想继续前一天的探索，去寻找这个小岛上最隐蔽的幽深处。潘克洛夫的推理合情合理，几乎可以得到确认的是，既然房屋无人居住，而工具、器皿、武器仍在那里，那么主人一定已经死亡了。因此，他一致同意应该寻找他的尸体，至少给他举行一个基督葬礼。","How long the night appeared to the sailor and his companions!Herbert alone slept for two hours, for at his age sleep is a necessity.They were all three anxious to continue their exploration of the day before, and to search the most secret recesses of the islet!The inferences deduced by Pencroft were perfectly reasonable, and it was nearly certain that, as the hut was deserted, and the tools, utensils, and weapons were still there, the owner had succumbed.It was agreed, therefore, that they should search for his remains, and give them at least Christian burial."
"天亮了，潘克洛夫和同伴马上继续考察这个住所。这个房子肯定建在了一个很优越的环境里，房子后面是一座小山，被五、六棵庞大的桉树遮盖着。房子前面穿过树林就是一大块空地，是用斧子砍出来的，这样视野就可以延伸到大海。草地是由破碎的木栅栏围起来的，草地那边就是海岸，海岸左边就是河流的出口。","Day dawned; Pencroft and his companions immediately proceeded to survey the dwelling.It had certainly been built in a favorable situation, at the back of a little hill, sheltered by five or six magnificent gum-trees.Before its front and through the trees the axe had prepared a wide clearing, which allowed the view to extend to the sea.Beyond a lawn, surrounded by a wooden fence falling to pieces, was the shore, on the left of which was the mouth of the stream."
"这个小屋是用木板建成的，很容易看出这些木板是从船身或者甲板上取来的。很可能有一只失去航行能力的船只被丢在这个岛的海岸上，船上至少有一位船员侥幸还生，并且这个人利用手中拥有的工具，用船的残骸建了这个房子。","The hut had been built of planks, and it was easy to see that these planks had been obtained from the hull or deck of a ship.It was probable that a disabled vessel had been cast on the coast of the island, that one at least of the crew had been saved, and that by means of the wreck this man, having tools at his disposal, had built the dwelling."
"事实变得更加明显，当吉丁·史佩莱围绕这个房子走了一圈后，他看见在一块木板上——可能是失事船只上的一块锚——写着这些字母，已经有一半被抹掉了。","And this became still more evident when Gideon Spilett, after having walked around the hut, saw on a plank, probably one of those which had formed the armor of the wrecked vessel, these letters already half effaced:"
"BR—TAN—A","BR—TAN—A"
"“大不列颠，”潘克洛夫喊道，记者这样称呼它，“许多船只都叫这个名字，我还说不上来这船究竟来自英国还是美国。”","“Britannia,” exclaimed Pencroft, whom the reporter had called; “it is a common name for ships, and I could not say if she was English or American!”"
"“这并不重要，潘克洛夫！”","“It matters very little, Pencroft!”"
"“确实是不怎么重要，”水手回答说，“如果船上有船员还活着，我们就该救这个生还者，不管他是哪个国家的人。但是，在我们再次寻找之前，我们先登上‘乘风破浪’号吧。”","“Very little indeed,” answered the sailor, “and we will save the survivor of her crew if he is still living, to whatever country he may belong.But before beginning our search again let us go on board the ‘Bonadventure’.”"
"一说到这个船，潘克洛夫就有一种不安。难道这个岛有人居住了吗，难道已经有人拥有了这个岛吗？但这个想法太不合理，他不禁耸了耸肩。无论如何，水手是不会为上船吃早餐而感到遗憾的。他们走过的路并不长，只有一英里。他们开始继续行走，眼睛盯着树木和丛林，里面有成百只山羊和猪在逃窜。","A sort of uneasiness had seized Pencroft upon the subject of his vessel.Should the island be inhabited after all, and should some one have taken possession of her?But he shrugged his shoulders at such an unreasonable supposition.At any rate the sailor was not sorry to go to breakfast on board.The road already trodden was not long, scarcely a mile.They set out on their walk, gazing into the wood and thickets through which goats and pigs fled in hundreds."
"离开房子20分钟后，潘克洛夫和同伴就到达了小岛的西海岸，同时看见“乘风破浪”号被锚牢牢牵住，深深陷在沙中。","Twenty minutes after leaving the hut Pencroft and his companions reached the western coast of the island, and saw the “Bonadventure” held fast by her anchor, which was buried deep in the sand."
"潘克洛夫忍不住满足地叹息。毕竟，这艘船是他的孩子，当它没发生什么事情的时候，父亲总会为孩子担心的。","Pencroft could not restrain a sigh of satisfaction.After all this vessel was his child, and it is the right of fathers to be often uneasy when there is no occasion for it."
"他们返回到船上，吃了早饭，这样就没必要到很晚的时候吃饭了。吃完饭后，他们又继续探索，十分小心。事实上，很有可能这个岛上唯一的居民已经死去。因此，潘克洛夫和他的同伴寻找的更多的是一个死人的痕迹，而不是活人的踪迹。可是他们的搜索毫无结果，当天中午，他们在小岛上茂密的树林中毫无目的地寻找。几乎可以肯定的是，如果遇难者死去了，现在也不会留下任何身体的痕迹，可能某种野兽已经把最后一根骨头都吞下去了。","They returned on board, breakfasted, so that it should not be necessary to dine until very late; then the repast being ended, the exploration was continued and conducted with the most minute care.Indeed, it was very probable that the only inhabitant of the island had perished.It was therefore more for the traces of a dead than of a living man that Pencroft and his companions searched.But their searches were vain, and during the half of that day they sought to no purpose among the thickets of trees which covered the islet.There was then scarcely any doubt that, if the castaway was dead, no trace of his body now remained, but that some wild beast had probably devoured it to the last bone."
"“我们在明天拂晓出发。”潘克洛夫和他的两个同伴说，这时候大约两点钟，他们在一丛杉树的树阴下休息了几分钟。","“We will set off to-morrow at daybreak,” said Pencroft to his two companions, as about two o’clock they were resting for a few minutes under the shade of a clump of firs."
"“我想我们可以毫无顾虑地拿走属于遇难者的那些器皿。”赫伯特补充说。","“I should think that we might without scruple take the utensils which belonged to the castaway,” added Herbert."
"“我也是这样想的，”吉丁·史佩莱说，“这些武器和工具可以补充花岗岩宫的储备。火药和子弹的供应同样是很重要的。”","“I think so, too,” returned Gideon Spilett, “and these arms and tools will make up the stores of Granite House.The supply of powder and shot is also most important.”"
"“是的，”潘克洛夫应道，“可是我们绝不能忘记要捉一两对那样的猪，林肯岛上没有这样的。”","“Yes,” replied Pencroft, “but we must not forget to capture a couple or two of those pigs, of which Lincoln Island is destitute.”"
"“也不能忘记收集那些种子，”赫伯特补充说，“这样我们就可以种出新旧世界的各种蔬菜。”","“Nor to gather those seeds,” added Herbert, “which will give us all the vegetables of the Old and the New Worlds.”"
"“也许最好的办法就是在达抱岛上多呆一天，这样就可以收集所有对我们有用的东西了。”记者说。","“Then perhaps it would be best,” said the reporter, “to remain a day longer on Tabor Island, so as to collect all that may be useful to us.”"
"“不，史佩莱先生，”潘克洛夫回答，“我要求你明天破晓时出发。我觉得风向似乎有可能转向西方，来的时候我们是顺风，回去的时候也会是顺风。”","“No, Mr. Spilett,” answered Pencroft, “I will ask you to set off to-morrow at daybreak.The wind seems to me to be likely to shift to the west, and after having had a fair wind for coming we shall have a fair wind for going back.”"
"“那我们就不要浪费时间了。”赫伯特站起来说。","“Then do not let us lose time,” said Herbert, rising."
"“我们不会浪费时间的，”潘克洛夫说，“你，赫伯特，去采集那些种子，你比我们懂得多。你采集种子的时候，史佩莱先生和我前去猎猪，虽然没有托普，我希望我们总会想办法捉到几头的！”","“We won’t waste time,” returned Pencroft.“You, Herbert, go and gather the seeds, which you know better than we do.While you do that, Mr. Spilett and I will go and have a pig hunt, and even without Top I hope we shall manage to catch a few!”"
"于是，赫伯特就走上了通向小岛上农作物生产地的小路，而水手和记者进入了树林。","Herbert accordingly took the path which led towards the cultivated part of the islet, while the sailor and the reporter entered the forest."
"很多种类的猪在他们面前逃窜，异常活跃，似乎是不想让他们靠近自己。","Many specimens of the porcine race fled before them, and these animals, which were singularly active, did not appear to be in a humor to allow themselves to be approached."
"可是，经过了一个小时的追捕后，猎人们仅仅捉住了躺在草丛中的一对。此时，他们听到从小岛北部传来的阵阵叫声的回响，叫声中夹杂着恐怖的喊叫声，这不可能是人类发出的叫声。","However, after an hour’s chase, the hunters had just managed to get hold of a couple lying in a thicket, when cries were heard resounding from the north part of the island. The cries were mingled terrible yells, in which there was nothing human."
"潘克洛夫和吉丁·史佩莱马上站起来，两头猪此时也开始逃跑，可是，水手此刻已经准备好绳子绑它们了。","Pencroft and Gideon Spilett were at once on their feet, and the pigs by this movement began to run away, at the moment when the sailor was getting ready the rope to bind them."
"“那是赫伯特的声音。”记者说。","“That’s Herbert’s voice,” said the reporter."
"“快跑！”潘克洛夫大喊。","“Run!” exclaimed Pencroft."
"水手和史佩莱立即朝着叫声传来的地方全速跑去。","And the sailor and Spilett immediately ran at full speed towards the spot from whence the cries proceeded."
"他们理应加速，因为在空地旁边的小路拐角处，他们看到男孩被摔在了地上，一个凶猛的东西，显然是只大猩猩，就要对他造成巨大伤害了。","They did well to hasten, for at a turn of the path near a clearing they saw the lad thrown on the ground and in the grasp of a savage being, apparently a gigantic ape, who was about to do him some great harm."
"潘克洛夫和吉丁·史佩莱在一分钟内要做的事情，就是冲向这个怪物，将他摔在地上，把赫伯特从他手中夺过来，然后把他紧紧地绑起来。水手有巨大的力气，记者也很有力，尽管怪物进行反抗，但是他们还是把他牢牢地拴住，这样他就不能动了。","To rush on this monster, throw him on the ground in his turn, snatch Herbert from him, then bind him securely, was the work of a minute for Pencroft and Gideon Spilett.The sailor was of Herculean strength, the reporter also very powerful, and in spite of the monster’s resistance he was firmly tied so that he could not even move."
"“你没有受伤吧，赫伯特？”史佩莱问。","“You are not hurt, Herbert?” asked Spilett."
"“没，没有！”","“No, no!”"
"“啊，要是这大猩猩伤着他，可就糟了！”潘克洛夫喊道。","“Oh, if this ape had wounded him!” exclaimed Pencroft."
"“可他不是只大猩猩。”赫伯特回答。","“But he is not an ape,” answered Herbert."
"听到这些话，潘克洛夫和吉丁·史配莱看着躺在地上的这个异常的东西。事实上，那不是只大猩猩，而是一个人，一个男人。可是这是怎样的一个人！他就是可以用所有恐怖词语描绘的野人，更可怕的是，他似乎还是最为野蛮的那一种。","At these words Pencroft and Gideon Spilett looked at the singular being who lay on the ground.Indeed it was not an ape; it was a human being, a man.But what a man!A savage in all the horrible acceptation of the word, and so much the more frightful that he seemed fallen to the lowest degree of brutishness!"
"他头发蓬乱，不加修整的胡须长到胸部，整个身子几乎全是裸露的，只有一块破布围在腰部。他两只眼睛带有狂怒的神情，双手很大，指甲非常长，皮肤是红褐色，双脚硬得就像是用牛角做的，这样一个可怜的生物还是能被称作人类。可是，也完全可以问他身体内是否有灵魂，或者只有残忍的本能才在他身体内存活下来！","Shaggy hair, untrimmed beard descending to the chest, the body almost naked except a rag round the waist, wild eyes, enormous hands with immensely long nails, skin the color of mahogany, feet as hard as if made of horn, such was the miserable creature who yet had a claim to be called a man.But it might justly be asked if there were yet a soul in this body, or if the brute instinct alone survived in it!"
"“你很肯定这是个人，或者他曾经是个人吗？”潘克洛夫问记者。","“Are you quite sure that this is a man, or that he has ever been one?” said Pencroft to the reporter."
"“哎呀！我对此十分肯定。”史佩莱说。","“Alas! there is no doubt about it,” replied Spilett."
"“那这一定是那个落难者吗？”赫伯特问。","“Then this must be the castaway?” asked Herbert."
"“是的，”吉丁·史佩莱说，“可是这个不幸的人身上已经没有人类的东西了！”","“Yes,” replied Gideon Spilett, “but the unfortunate man has no longer anything human about him!”"
"记者说出了事实。显然，如果这个落难者曾经是一个文明人，那么是孤独将他变成野人，甚至更糟的是，也许是树林中的一个正常人。阵阵嘶哑的声音透过牙齿从他的喉咙中传出来，他的牙齿很锋利，就像野兽那用来撕裂生肉的牙齿一样。","The reporter spoke the truth.It was evident that if the castaway had ever been a civilized being, solitude had made him a savage, or worse, perhaps a regular man of the woods.Hoarse sounds issued from his throat between his teeth, which were sharp as the teeth of a wild beast made to tear raw flesh."
"他一定是很久以前就丧失了记忆，长时间以来，他也已经忘记了怎样使用他的枪支和工具，甚至他也已不知道怎样生火了！可以看出来，他很活跃，也很有力气，他在身体素质得到发展的同时，道德品质却受到了损害。吉丁·史佩莱和他说话。他似乎听不懂，甚至是不去听。看着他的双眼，记者认为能看到他尚未完全泯灭的理性。然而，这个囚禁的人并没有挣扎，也并没有试图去挣脱捆绑。他曾经同为人类，难道现在他被人类伙伴的出现制服了？难道他在脑中的某个部分找到了短暂的回忆，让他想起自己是人类？如果把他放开，他会试着逃走还是会留下来？他们不知道，也不去尝试，在专心地注视着这个悲惨的生物后，说道：","Memory must have deserted him long before, and for a long time also he had forgotten how to use his gun and tools, and he no longer knew how to make a fire!It could be seen that he was active and powerful, but the physical qualities had been developed in him to the injury of the moral qualities.Gideon Spilett spoke to him.He did not appear to understand or even to hear.And yet on looking into his eyes, the reporter thought he could see that all reason was not extinguished in him.However, the prisoner did not struggle, nor even attempt to break his bonds.Was he overwhelmed by the presence of men whose fellow he had once been?Had he found in some corner of his brain a fleeting remembrance which recalled him to humanity?If free, would he attempt to fly, or would he remain?They could not tell, but they did not make the experiment; and after gazing attentively at the miserable creature,—"
"“不管他是谁，”吉丁·史佩莱说，“不管他有可能是谁，也不管他会变成什么样，我们的任务就是将他带回林肯岛。”","“Whoever he may be,” remarked Gideon Spilett, “whoever he may have been, and whatever he may become, it is our duty to take him with us to Lincoln Island.”"
"“对，对！”赫伯特回应，“也许经过细心照顾，我们会唤起他的一点智慧。”","“Yes, yes!” replied Herbert, “and perhaps with care we may arouse in him same gleam of intelligence.”"
"“灵魂没有死，”记者说，“将上帝创造的生物从野蛮中拯救出来，是一件非常令人满意的事情。”","“The soul does not die,” said the reporter, “and it would be a great satisfaction to rescue one of God’s creatures from brutishness.”"
"潘克洛夫怀疑地摇着头。","Pencroft shook his head doubtfully."
"“不管怎样，我们必须尝试一下，”记者说，“人性促使我们这样做。”","“We must try at any rate,” returned the reporter; “humanity commands us.”"
"这确实是作为基督徒和文明人的责任。三人都是这样想的，因此，他们也深知赛勒斯·哈丁会同意他们这样做的。","It was indeed their duty as Christians and civilized beings.All three felt this, and they well knew that Cyrus Harding would approve of their acting thus."
"“我们要给他松绑吗？”水手问。","“Shall we leave him bound?” asked the sailor."
"“如果解开他的双脚，也许他能够走路。”赫伯特说。","“Perhaps he would walk if his feet were unfastened,” said Herbert."
"“我们试一下。”潘克洛夫回答。","“Let us try,” replied Pencroft."
"他们将绑住囚禁者双脚的绳子切断，但是胳膊还是绑得紧紧的。他自己站了起来，也没有表现出要逃跑的意思。他用坚定的眼睛向这三个向他靠近的人投射犀利的目光，但是丝毫没有表示出，他回忆起自己和他们是同类，或者至少曾是这样。嘶嘶声还是不断地从唇间发出来，他外表狂野，可是他并没有试图反抗。","The cords which shackled the prisoner’s feet were cut off, but his arms remained securely fastened.He got up by himself and did not manifest any desire to run away.His hard eyes darted a piercing glance at the three men, who walked near him, but nothing denoted that he recollected being their fellow, or at least having been so.A continual hissing sound issued from his lips, his aspect was wild, but he did not attempt to resist."
"他们听从了记者的建议，将这个不幸的人带到了小屋。也许看到这些属于他的东西，他就会有些印象。也许一个火花就足以恢复他模糊的心智，重新点燃他迟钝的心灵。那个房子并不远。几分钟后，他们就到了那里，可是俘虏记不起任何事情，看起来他已经丧失了所有意识。","By the reporter’s advice the unfortunate man was taken to the hut.Perhaps the sight of the things that belonged to him would make some impression on him!Perhaps a spark would be sufficient to revive his obscured intellect, to rekindle his dulled soul.The dwelling was not far off.In a few minutes they arrived there, but the prisoner remembered nothing, and it appeared that he had lost consciousness of everything."
"对这个可怜生命的野蛮程度，他们只能作出这样的猜测：他被困在这个小岛上的时间要追溯到非常遥远的过去，到这里以后，孤独将一个理性的人变成现在的状态。","What could they think of the degree of brutishness into which this miserable being had fallen, unless that his imprisonment on the islet dated from a very distant period and after having arrived there a rational being solitude had reduced him to this condition."
"记者认为，也许他看到火后会有些变化，于是，美丽的火焰马上在壁炉里燃烧起来，连动物也被吸引了过来。刚开始，炉火似乎引起了这个不幸的人的注意，可是转过身后，眼睛里智慧的光芒也逐渐消失了。很明显，他们没有事情可做了，至少眼下要做的就是将他带到“乘风破浪”号上去。这些完成后，由潘克洛夫负责在那里看管他。","The reporter then thought that perhaps the sight of fire would have some effect on him, and in a moment one of those beautiful flames, that attract even animals, blazed up on the hearth.The sight of the flame seemed at first to fix the attention of the unhappy object, but soon he turned away and the look of intelligence faded.Evidently there was nothing to be done, for the time at least, but to take him on board the “Bonadventure.”This was done, and he remained there in Pencroft’s charge."
"赫伯特和史佩莱又返回去完成他们的工作，几小时后他们回到岸上，手中拿着器皿和枪支，很多蔬菜和种子，一些猎物和四头猪。","Herbert and Spilett returned to finish their work; and some hours after they came back to the shore, carrying the utensils and guns, a store of vegetables, of seeds, some game, and two couple of pigs."
"所有人登船后，“乘风破浪”号准备好启锚，乘早潮出海。","All was embarked, and the “Bonadventure” was ready to weigh anchor and sail with the morning tide."
"他们把囚犯放在了船首的客舱，他很安静地呆在那里，一句话也不说，很明显是又聋又哑。","The prisoner had been placed in the fore-cabin, where he remained quiet, silent, apparently deaf and dumb."
"潘克洛夫给他东西吃，他却将送到他面前的熟肉推开了，毫无疑问，熟肉不适合他。可是，当水手把赫伯特杀死的一只鸭子递给他时，他像一个野兽似的扑上去，贪婪地吞咽着。","Pencroft offered him something to eat, but he pushed away the cooked meat that was presented to him and which doubtless did not suit him.But on the sailor showing him one of the ducks which Herbert had killed, he pounced on it like a wild beast, and devoured it greedily."
"“你认为他会恢复意识吗？”潘克洛夫问。“我们对他的照顾产生作用，这不是没有可能的，因为是孤独将他变成现在这个样子，从今以后他不会再孤独了。”","“You think that he will recover his senses?” asked Pencroft.“It is not impossible that our care will have an effect upon him, for it is solitude that has made him what he is, and from this time forward he will be no longer alone.”"
"“毫无疑问，这个可怜的人处于这样的状态一定很久了。”赫伯特说。","“The poor man must no doubt have been in this state for a long time,” said Herbert."
"“可能吧。”吉丁·史佩莱回答。","“Perhaps,” answered Gideon Spilett."
"“他大约多大？”男孩问。","“About what age is he?” asked the lad."
"“很难说，”记者回答，“因为他浓密的胡须遮盖了脸部，要看到他的相貌是不可能的，不过他年纪不小了，我想他大概有50岁。”","“It is difficult to say,” replied the reporter, “for it is impossible to see his features under the thick beard which covers his face, but he is no longer young, and I suppose he might be about fifty.”"
"“史佩莱先生，你有没有注意到他的眼睛陷得有多深啊？”赫伯特问。","“Have you noticed, Mr. Spilett, how deeply sunk his eyes are?” asked Herbert."
"“是的，赫伯特，不过我必须补充一点，跟他的外表相比，他的眼睛更像人类的眼睛。”","“Yes, Herbert, but I must add that they are more human than one could expect from his appearance.”"
"“可是，我们会看到，”潘克洛夫回答，“我急于想知道，哈丁上尉看到我们带来的这个野人会怎么想。我们本来要寻找的是一个人，我们带回来的却是一个怪兽！不过，我们已经尽力了。”","“However, we shall see,” replied Pencroft, “and I am anxious to know what opinion Captain Harding will have of our savage.We went to look for a human creature, and we are bringing back a monster!After all, we did what we could.”"
"夜晚过去了，他们不知道囚犯有没有睡觉，但是不管怎样，虽然他没有被绑，但是他没有动。他就像是一个野蛮的动物，捉住他时，起初看起来很震惊，后来又变野蛮了。","The night passed, and whether the prisoner slept or not could not be known, but at any rate, although he had been unbound, he did not move.He was like a wild animal, which appears stunned at first by its capture, and becomes wild again afterwards."
"第二天是10月15日，天刚亮，天气就发生了变化，这是潘克洛夫预测到的。风向已经转向西北，有利于“乘风破浪”号的返航，但同时风力加大了，这样可能会使航行变得更加困难。","At daybreak the next morning, the 15th of October, the change of weather predicted by Pencroft occurred.The wind having shifted to the northwest favored the return of the “Bonadventure,” but at the same time it freshened, which might render navigation more difficult."
"早上五点的时候，船起锚了。潘克洛夫从主帆上取下一张帆，将船开向东北方，这样就能直航行至林肯岛。","At five o’clock in the morning the anchor was weighed.Pencroft took a reef in the mainsail, and steered towards the north-east, so as to sail straight for Lincoln Island."
"航行的第一天没有发生任何事情。这个囚犯呆在船首的客舱里，保持沉默，因为他以前是个水手，似乎船只的运动可能会在他身上产生有益的反应。他之前的职业会使一些记忆回到他的大脑吗？尽管这有可能，但是他仍然保持安静，惊讶却不沮丧。","The first day of the voyage was not marked by any incident.The prisoner remained quiet in the fore-cabin, and as he had been a sailor it appeared that the motion of the vessel might produce on him a salutary reaction.Did some recollection of his former calling return to him?However that might be, he remained tranquil, astonished rather than depressed."
"第二天风力加大了，大多是从北方吹来的，因此，这对“乘风破浪”号不是一个有利的方向了。很快，潘克洛夫不得不收起风帆，但是他一句话也没说，他开始担心海里的状况，经常转动着船头。可以肯定的是，如果风力不减，到达林肯岛的时间要比到达抱岛的时间要长。","The next day the wind increased, blowing more from the north, consequently in a less favorable direction for the “Bonadventure.”Pencroft was soon obliged to sail close-hauled, and without saying anything about it he began to be uneasy at the state of the sea, which frequently broke over the bows.Certainly, if the wind did not moderate, it would take a longer time to reach Lincoln Island than it had taken to make Tabor Island."
"实际上，到17号早上，“乘风破浪”号在海上已经航行了48个小时了，可是没有迹象表明船已经靠近小岛了。而且，由于船速不稳定，不可能估算出船只穿过的距离，也不能确定估测的方向。","Indeed, on the morning of the 17th, the “Bonadventure” had been forty-eight hours at sea, and nothing showed that she was near the island.It was impossible, besides, to estimate the distance traversed, or to trust to the reckoning for the direction, as the speed had been very irregular."
"24个小时后，他们还没有看见小岛。海风迎面吹来，掀起了巨大的海浪。所有的帆都收起来了，也时常抢风航行。在18号，一股海浪完全掠过了“乘风破浪”号，要不是船员们作好预防措施，在甲板上卧倒，他们就给海浪卷走了。","Twenty-four hours after there was yet no land in sight.The wind was right ahead and the sea very heavy.The sails were close-reefed, and they tacked frequently.On the 18th, a wave swept completely over the “Bonadventure”; and if the crew had not taken the precaution of lashing themselves to the deck, they would have been carried away."
"这种情况下，潘克洛夫和他的同伴们都忙于放松自己，却从囚犯那里获得了意外的帮助。囚犯从船舱里出来，就好像他水手的本能突然回来了，他用一根桅杆在船侧戳了个洞，这样甲板上装满的水就流出去了。船上的水排净后，他又一言不发地回到舱里。潘克洛夫、吉丁·史佩莱和赫伯特非常吃惊，也没有管他。","On this occasion Pencroft and his companions, who were occupied with loosing themselves, received unexpected aid from the prisoner, who emerged from the hatchway as if his sailor’s instinct had suddenly returned, broke a piece out of the bulwarks with a spar so as to let the water which filled the deck escape.Then the vessel being clear, he descended to his cabin without having uttered a word.Pencroft, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert, greatly astonished, let him proceed."
"他们的情形确实很严峻，水手有理由相信他已经迷失再一片汪洋之中了，也不可能再回到航线上了。","Their situation was truly serious, and the sailor had reason to fear that he was lost on the wide sea without any possibility of recovering his course."
"当天的夜晚又黑又冷。不过，大约11点的时候，风力降下来了，海水也退了，船只航行起来也不那么费力了，船速急速上升。","The night was dark and cold.However, about eleven o’clock, the wind fell, the sea went down, and the speed of the vessel, as she labored less, greatly increased."
"潘克洛夫、史佩莱和赫伯特都没有想过要睡上一个小时。他们警觉地看着外面，因为，林肯岛可能就在不远处，也许破晓时就能看到了，也许“乘风破浪”号被水流带动，漂流得太多，他们已无法调整航线了。潘克洛夫极度不安，但是他没有绝望，因为他有一颗勇敢的心。他手握船桅，焦急地希望用目光穿透四周的黑暗。","Neither Pencroft, Spilett, nor Herbert thought of taking an hour’s sleep.They kept a sharp look-out, for either Lincoln Island could not be far distant and would be sighted at daybreak, or the “Bonadventure,” carried away by currents, had drifted so much that it would be impossible to rectify her course.Pencroft, uneasy to the last degree, yet did not despair, for he had a gallant heart, and grasping the tiller he anxiously endeavored to pierce the darkness which surrounded them."
"大约早上两点钟的时候，他大声喊道：","About two o’clock in the morning he started forward,—"
"“光！光！”他大声喊。","“A light! a light!” he shouted."
"实际上，这道明亮的光好像是在东北方20海里处。林肯岛就在那里，这堆火很显然是赛勒斯·哈丁点燃的，为他们的航行指引了方向。潘克洛夫偏向北方太多，因此他改变路线，转向有火的方向，火在海平线上熊熊燃烧，就像一颗一等星一样明亮。","Indeed, a bright light appeared twenty miles to the northeast.Lincoln Island was there, and this fire, evidently lighted by Cyrus Harding, showed them the course to be followed.Pencroft, who was bearing too much to the north, altered his course and steered towards the fire, which burned brightly above the horizon like a star of the first magnitude."
"第十五章","Chapter 15"
"第二天，也就是10月20日早上七点，在海上航行四天后，“乘风破浪”号静静地滑向慈悲河出口处的沙滩。","The next day, the 20th of October, at seven o’clock in the morning, after a voyage of four days, the “Bonadventure” gently glided up to the beach at the mouth of the Mercy."
"由于天气恶劣，同伴们迟迟未归，赛勒斯·哈丁和纳布变得非常不安。天刚破晓，他们就爬上眺望岗的高地，终于看见了在归航途中多时的船只。","Cyrus Harding and Neb, who had become very uneasy at the bad weather and the prolonged absence of their companions, had climbed at daybreak to the plateau of Prospect Heights, and they had at last caught sight of the vessel which had been so long in returning."
"“感谢上帝！他们在那儿！”赛勒斯·哈丁大喊。","“God be praised! there they are!” exclaimed Cyrus Harding."
"纳布很高兴，他开始转着圈跳起舞来，边拍掌边喊：“哦！我的主人！”这场表扬比最精彩的演讲还要动人。","As to Neb in his joy, he began to dance, to twirl round, clapping his hands and shouting, “Oh! my master!”A more touching pantomime than the finest discourse."
"清点了“乘风破浪”号甲板上的人后，工程师首先想到的是，潘克洛夫没有找到达抱岛上的那个落难者，要不就是这个不幸的人无论如何也不愿离开那个岛，再换一个监狱。","The engineer’s first idea, on counting the people on the deck of the “Bonadventure,” was that Pencroft had not found the castaway of Tabor Island, or at any rate that the unfortunate man had refused to leave his island and change one prison for another."
"事实上，只有潘克洛夫、吉丁·史佩莱和赫伯特三人在“乘风破浪”号的甲板上。","Indeed Pencroft, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert were alone on the deck of the “Bonadventure.”"
"船触地的时候，工程师和纳布正在沙滩上等待，在乘客跳上沙滩之前，哈丁说：“我们因你们的迟归感到非常不安，朋友们！你们有没有遇到什么麻烦啊？”","The moment the vessel touched, the engineer and Neb were waiting on the beach, and before the passengers had time to leap on to the sand, Harding said: “We have been very uneasy at your delay, my friends!Did you meet with any accident?”"
"“没有，”吉丁·史佩莱回答说，“相反，一切进行得非常顺利。我们会把所有的经过讲给你听。”","“No,” replied Gideon Spilett; “on the contrary, everything went wonderfully well.We will tell you all about it.”"
"“不过，”工程师说，“你们的搜索没有成功，因为只有你们三个人，和你们走的时候数目一样！”","“However,” returned the engineer, “your search has been unsuccessful, since you are only three, just as you went!”"
"“不对，上尉，”水手回答，“我们是四个人。”","“Excuse me, captain,” replied the sailor, “we are four.”"
"“你们找到那个落难者了？”","“You have found the castaway?”"
"“是的。”","“Yes.”"
"“你们把他带回来了？”","“And you have brought him?”"
"“是的。”","“Yes.”"
"“活着？”","“Living?”"
"“是的。”","“Yes.”"
"“那他在哪里？他是谁？”","“Where is he?Who is he?”"
"“他是，”记者回答，“或者说他曾经是人！赛勒斯，这就是我们能告诉你的全部。”","“He is,” replied the reporter, “or rather he was a man!There, Cyrus, that is all we can tell you!”"
"他们向工程师讲述了在航海行程中发生的事情，他们是在什么样的环境下进行搜索的，岛上唯一的住所是怎样被长时间地抛弃的，这个看似不再属于人类的落难者最后是怎么捉住的。","The engineer was then informed of all that had passed during the voyage, and under what conditions the search had been conducted; how the only dwelling in the island had long been abandoned; how at last a castaway had been captured, who appeared no longer to belong to the human species."
"“这才是重点，”潘克洛夫补充说，“我不知道将他带到这个地方来是不是妥当。”","“And that’s just the point,” added Pencroft, “I don’t know if we have done right to bring him here.”"
"“你做的当然对，潘克洛夫。”工程师立即回答。","“Certainly you have, Pencroft,” replied the engineer quickly."
"“不过这个不幸的生物已经没有意识了！”","“But the wretched creature has no sense!”"
"“目前可能是这样，”赛勒斯·哈丁回答，“可是就在几个月前，这个不幸的生物就是一个人，就像你和我。谁又会知道我们这些幸存者在这个岛上经历长期孤独后，会变成什么样子？孤单是极其不幸的事情，我们必须相信，孤独可以迅速摧毁理性，因为你们找到的这个可怜的生物就处于这样的状态。”","“That is possible at present,” replied Cyrus Harding, “but only a few months ago the wretched creature was a man like you and me.And who knows what will become of the survivor of us after a long solitude on this island?It is a great misfortune to be alone, my friends; and it must be believed that solitude can quickly destroy reason, since you have found this poor creature in such a state!”"
"“可是，上尉，”赫伯特问，“是什么让你认为这个不幸的人仅是在几个月前开始变野蛮的呢？”","“But, captain,” asked Herbert, “what leads you to think that the brutishness of the unfortunate man began only a few months back?”"
"“因为我们找到的那张纸条是最近才写的，”工程师回答，“并且只有落难者才能写。”","“Because the document we found had been recently written,” answered the engineer, “and the castaway alone can have written it.”"
"“我总觉得，”吉丁·史佩莱说，“这张纸条不会是这个人死去的同伴写的吧。”","“Always supposing,” observed Gideon Spilett, “that it had not been written by a companion of this man, since dead.”"
"“那是不可能的事情，我亲爱的史佩莱。”","“That is impossible, my dear Spilett.”"
"“为什么？”记者问。","“Why so?” asked the reporter."
"“因为若是那样，纸条上当时写的应该是两个落难者，”哈丁回答，“而上面只提到一个。”","“Because the document would then have spoken of two castaways,” replied Harding, “and it mentioned only one.”"
"赫伯特简单叙述了航行的经过，重点讲述了这个奇怪的事实，风暴大作的时候，囚徒的脑子突然灵光一现，成为一名水手。","Herbert then in a few words related the incidents of the voyage, and dwelt on the curious fact of the sort of passing gleam in the prisoner’s mind, when for an instant in the height of the storm he had become a sailor."
"“嗯，赫伯特，”工程师回答，“你很重视这个事实是正确的。这个不幸的人不是不可救药的，是绝望把他变成现在的这个样子。不过，在这里他找到了他的同伴，既然他还有灵魂，我们就要拯救这个灵魂！”","“Well, Herbert,” replied the engineer, “you are right to attach great importance to this fact.The unfortunate man cannot be incurable, and despair has made him what he is; but here he will find his fellow-men, and since there is still a soul in him, this soul we shall save!”"
"令工程师感到很遗憾、令纳布感到很吃惊的是，把达抱岛上的这个落难者从“乘风破浪”号船头的舱中带出来之后，一踏上陆地，他就想要逃跑。","The castaway of Tabor Island, to the great pity of the engineer and the great astonishment of Neb, was then brought from the cabin which he occupied in the fore part of the “Bonadventure”; when once on land he manifested a wish to run away."
"赛勒斯·哈丁走上前去，以充满权威的姿态，将手放在他的肩膀上，无限温柔地看着他。这个不幸的人马上服从了上级的意愿，渐渐地冷静下来，眼睛也垂了下来，同时也低下了头，不再反抗。","But Cyrus Harding approaching, placed his hand on his shoulder with a gesture full of authority, and looked at him with infinite tenderness.Immediately the unhappy man, submitting to a superior will, gradually became calm, his eyes fell, his head bent, and he made no more resistance."
"“可怜的家伙！”工程师低声说。","“Poor fellow!” murmured the engineer."
"赛勒斯·哈丁用心地观察他。从他的外表看，这个可怜的人身上已经没有人的特征了，和记者一样，哈丁注意到他的表情中有一种难以说明的智慧。","Cyrus Harding had attentively observed him.To judge by his appearance this miserable being had no longer anything human about him, and yet Harding, as had the reporter already, observed in his look an indefinable trace of intelligence."
"他认为这个落难者，确切地说，正如他的同伴们所说，这个陌生人应该住在花岗石宫的一个房间里，在那里他逃不出去。他们毫不费力地将他带到那里，他们希望经过细心的照顾，某天他有可能成为林肯岛居民的同伴。","It was decided that the castaway, or rather the stranger as he was thenceforth termed by his companions, should live in one of the rooms of Granite House, from which, however, he could not escape.He was led there without difficulty, and with careful attention, it might, perhaps, be hoped that some day he would be a companion to the settlers in Lincoln Island."
"纳布匆匆准备了早饭，因为记者、赫伯特和潘克洛夫饿得要命。吃早饭的时候，赛勒斯·哈丁详细听了一下他们去小岛探索的航程中发生的所有事情的细节。在有一点上，他与朋友意见一致，那就是，通过大不列颠这个名称，他们猜想这个陌生人不是英国人就是美国人；另外，从那浓密的胡子、又长又乱的头发来看，工程师可以看出盎格鲁—撒克逊人的典型特征。","Cyrus Harding, during breakfast, which Neb had hastened to prepare, as the reporter, Herbert, and Pencroft were dying of hunger, heard in detail all the incidents which had marked the voyage of exploration to the islet.He agreed with his friends on this point, that the stranger must be either English or American, the name Britannia leading them to suppose this, and, besides, through the bushy beard, and under the shaggy, matted hair, the engineer thought he could recognize the characteristic features of the Anglo-Saxon."
"“不过，顺便提一下，”吉丁·史佩莱对赫伯特说，“你从未告诉我们你是怎么遇到这个野人的，要不是我们及时赶到救你，你会被他勒死，除此之外我们一无所知！”","“But, by the bye,” said Gideon Spilett, addressing Herbert, “you never told us how you met this savage, and we know nothing, except that you would have been strangled, if we had not happened to come up in time to help you!”"
"“说实话，”赫伯特说，“很难说清楚那是怎么发生的。我想，当时我正忙着收集植物，就听到一个声音，就像从一棵很高的树上掉下来的雪崩一样。我几乎来不及查看四周。这个不幸的人，毫无疑问就藏在树上，说时迟，那时快，他一下子向我扑来，要不是史佩莱先生和潘克洛夫——”","“Upon my word,” answered Herbert, “it is rather difficult to say how it happened.I was, I think, occupied in collecting my plants, when I heard a noise like an avalanche falling from a very tall tree.I scarcely had time to look round.This unfortunate man, who was without doubt concealed in a tree, rushed upon me in less time than I take to tell you about it, and unless Mr. Spilett and Pencroft—”"
"“我的孩子！”赛勒斯·哈丁说，“你冒了一个巨大的危险，但是，也许不这样，这个可怜的生物仍藏在你们的搜查范围之外，我们也不会有一个新的伙伴。”","“My boy!” said Cyrus Harding, “you ran a great danger, but, perhaps, without that, the poor creature would have still hidden himself from your search, and we should not have had a new companion.”"
"“那么，赛勒斯，你想成功地改造这个人吗？”记者问。","“You hope, then, Cyrus, to succeed in reforming the man?” asked the reporter."
"“不错。”工程师回答。","“Yes,” replied the engineer."
"吃过早饭，哈丁和同伴就离开了花岗岩宫，回到了海滩上。他们各自忙着卸载“乘风破浪”号上面的货物，工程师检查了武器和工具，并没有看到能够帮助他们确定这个陌生人身份的东西。","Breakfast over, Harding and his companions left Granite House and returned to the beach.They there occupied themselves in unloading the “Bonadventure,” and the engineer, having examined the arms and tools, saw nothing which could help them to establish the identity of the stranger."
"他们认为，在岛上捉住的猪对林肯岛来说非常有益，他们将这些动物带到猪圈，很快它们就变得自在起来。","The capture of pigs, made on the islet, was looked upon as being very profitable to Lincoln Island, and the animals were led to the sty, where they soon became at home."
"有两个桶，里面分别装着火药和弹药，还有一盒雷管，这些都很受欢迎。他们一致同意在花岗石宫或上岩洞里建一个火药库，在那里不用担心爆炸。可是，还要继续使用棉花火药，因为这种物质产生非常好的效果，没有理由替换成普通的药粉。","The two barrels, containing the powder and shot, as well as the box of caps, were very welcome.It was agreed to establish a small powder-magazine, either outside Granite House or in the Upper Cavern, where there would be no fear of explosion.However, the use of pyroxyle was to be continued, for this substance giving excellent results, there was no reason for substituting ordinary powder."
"当船上的卸载工作完成的时候，潘克洛夫说：","When the unloading of the vessel was finished,—"
"“上尉，我认为将我们的‘乘风破浪’号放在一个安全的地方比较妥当。”","“Captain,” said Pencroft, “I think it would be prudent to put our ‘Bonadventure’ in a safe place.”"
"“难道停在慈悲河口不安全吗？”赛勒斯·哈丁问。","“Is she not safe at the mouth of the Mercy?” asked Cyrus Harding."
"“是的，上尉。”水手回答，“有一半时间它是搁浅在沙上的，这样会磨损的。你也知道，这艘船很有名，在我们返程时遇到了暴风雨，影响了航行，可是它表现极好。”","“No, captain,” replied the sailor.“Half of the time she is stranded on the sand, and that works her.She is a famous craft, you see, and she behaved admirably during the squall which struck us on our return.”"
"“不能让它浮在河上吗？”","“Could she not float in the river?”"
"“毫无疑问，上尉，可以。不过，那里没有可以遮蔽的地方，一旦刮起东风，我担心‘乘风破浪’号就会受到海浪的冲击。”","“No doubt, captain, she could; but there is no shelter there, and in the east winds, I think that the ‘Bonadventure’ would suffer much from the surf.”"
"“那么，你会把它停在哪里呢，潘克洛夫？”","“Well, where would you put her, Pencroft?”"
"“停在气球港。”水手说，“那个小港周围是岩石，我觉得这似乎就是我们要找的海港。”","“In Port Balloon,” replied the sailor.“That little creek, shut in by rocks, seems to me to be just the harbor we want.”"
"“不会太远吧？”","“Is it not rather far?”"
"“不！离花岗岩宫不过三英里，有一条很好的直道可以把我们带到那里！”","“Pooh! it is not more than three miles from Granite House, and we have a fine straight road to take us there!”"
"“那就这样做吧，潘克洛夫，并将你的‘乘风破浪’号带过去，”工程师回答，“我宁愿它得到我们更多及时的保护。如果我们还有时间，就必须为它建一个小港。”","“Do it then, Pencroft, and take your ‘Bonadventure’ there,” replied the engineer, “and yet I would rather have her under our more immediate protection.When we have time, we must make a little harbor for her.”"
"“太好了！”潘克洛夫喊道，“港上还有灯塔、码头和船坞！啊！真的，上尉，和你在一起，一切都变得很容易了。”","“Famous!” exclaimed Pencroft.“A harbor with a lighthouse, a pier, and dock!Ah! really with you, captain, everything becomes easy.”"
"“是的，我勇敢的潘克洛夫，”工程师回答，“但是依情况而定。但是，你帮助了我，在我们所有的工作中，你做的抵得上三个人做的。”","“Yes, my brave Pencroft,” answered the engineer, “but on condition, however, that you help me, for you do as much as three men in all our work.”"
"赫伯特和水手再次登上“乘风破浪”号，然后拔起锚，升起帆，海风吹着它迅速驶向爪角。两小时后，船就停靠在了气球港宁静的水面上。","Herbert and the sailor then re-embarked on board the “Bonadventure,” the anchor was weighed, the sail hoisted, and the wind drove her rapidly towards Claw Cape.Two hours after, she was reposing on the tranquil waters of Port Balloon."
"陌生人在花岗岩宫度过的最初的日子里，是否使他们有理由相信他野蛮的性格变得温顺了？他那昏暗的心灵深处是否燃烧着明亮的火光？简而言之，他的灵魂是否回到躯体了呢？","During the first days passed by the stranger in Granite House, had he already given them reason to think that his savage nature was becoming tamed?Did a brighter light burn in the depths of that obscured mind?In short, was the soul returning to the body?"
"是的，可以肯定的是，在这种程度上，赛勒斯·哈丁和记者想知道这个不幸的人的理性是否已经完全消失。首先，由于他过惯了在达抱岛上享受的户外生活，习惯了无拘无束的自由，这个陌生人显得闷闷不乐、愤怒，他们担心他有可能从花岗岩宫的某个窗户跳到沙滩上。不过，慢慢地，他变得冷静了一些，他也因此得到了更多的活动自由。","Yes, to a certainty, and to such a degree, that Cyrus Harding and the reporter wondered if the reason of the unfortunate man had ever been totally extinguished.At first, accustomed to the open air, to the unrestrained liberty which he had enjoyed on Tabor Island, the stranger manifested a sullen fury, and it was feared that he might throw himself onto the beach, out of one of the windows of Granite House.But gradually he became calmer, and more freedom was allowed to his movements."
"他们有理由去期待，期待很多。陌生人已经忘记了他食肉的本能，与在岛上他吃的食物相比，他接受的野性食物要少一些，而且给他熟肉，他也没有产生在“乘风破浪”号上表现的排斥情绪。赛勒斯·哈丁趁他睡觉的时候，剪掉了他的头发和乱糟糟的胡子。他的头发和胡子有点像鬃毛，这使他看起来就像个野人。他们把盖在他身上的破布拿走后，穿的也较得体了。由于大家的照顾，陌生人恢复了更为像人的面貌，他的双眼似乎变得更加温和了。肯定地说，过去这个人脸上罩着智慧的光芒时，他一定是很俊俏的。","They had reason to hope, and to hope much.Already, forgetting his carnivorous instincts, the stranger accepted a less bestial nourishment than that on which he fed on the islet, and cooked meat did not produce in him the same sentiment of repulsion which he had showed on board the “Bonadventure.”Cyrus Harding had profited by a moment when he was sleeping, to cut his hair and matted beard, which formed a sort of mane and gave him such a savage aspect.He had also been clothed more suitably, after having got rid of the rag which covered him.The result was that, thanks to these attentions, the stranger resumed a more human appearance, and it even seemed as if his eyes had become milder.Certainly, when formerly lighted up by intelligence, this man’s face must have had a sort of beauty."
"哈丁每天总要亲自陪他度过几个小时。他靠近陌生人，做着各种各样的工作，为的是吸引他的注意力。实际上，火花就足以照亮那颗心灵，大脑中闪过的一点回忆就可以唤回他的理智。遇到暴风雨的时候，“乘风破浪”号上发生的事情就证明了这点！工程师还特意大声说话，从听觉和视觉两个器官来同时穿透他那麻痹心智的深处。有时候是这个伙伴，有时候是另一个，有时候是所有的人和他一起做这种工作。他们的谈话内容大多与航海有关，任何水手听到后都会感兴趣的。","Every day, Harding imposed on himself the task of passing some hours in his company.He came and worked near him, and occupied himself in different things, so as to fix his attention.A spark, indeed, would be sufficient to reillumine that soul, a recollection crossing that brain to recall reason.That had been seen, during the storm, on board the “Bonadventure!The engineer did not neglect either to speak aloud, so as to penetrate at the same time by the organs of hearing and sight the depths of that torpid intelligence.Sometimes one of his companions, sometimes another, sometimes all joined him.They spoke most often of things belonging to the navy, which must interest a sailor."
"有时候，这个陌生人会对他们所说的话表示一点关注，于是，居民们很快就相信他能听懂一部分。有时他的脸色显得极度悲伤，这说明他精神上遭受了打击，这不会弄错，因为从他的表情上可以看得出来。可是，有时候，即使他们几乎认为他就要开口说话了，但是他还是没有说。不管怎样，这个可怜的动物非常安静，也非常悲伤！","At times, the stranger gave some slight attention to what was said, and the settlers were soon convinced that he partly understood them.Sometimes the expression of his countenance was deeply sorrowful, a proof that he suffered mentally, for his face could not be mistaken; but he did not speak, although at different times, however, they almost thought that words were about to issue from his lips.At all events, the poor creature was quite quiet and sad!"
"可是，他的冷静会不会仅仅是表面上的呢？他的悲伤会不会是因为孤独造成的呢？现在什么都不确定。呆在一定的环境中，他只能看到一定的物体，接触的总是开拓者，这些他很快就习惯了。他什么都不缺，对好的食物、好的衣服没有欲望，自然地，他的自然本性也就慢慢地改变了。可是，他心中已经有了这种新生活的意识吗？或者用一个极为适合他的词来说，他是不是会像畜生对他的主人那样变得“驯服”了？这个问题很重要，赛勒斯·哈丁急于得到答案，他又不想粗鲁地对待这个弱者。他能慢慢地恢复吗？","But was not his calm only apparent?Was not his sadness only the result of his seclusion?Nothing could yet be ascertained.Seeing only certain objects and in a limited space, always in contact with the colonists, to whom he would soon become accustomed, having no desires to satisfy, better fed, better clothed, it was natural that his physical nature should gradually improve; but was he penetrated with the sense of a new life? or rather, to employ a word which would be exactly applicable to him, was he not becoming tamed, like an animal in company with his master?This was an important question, which Cyrus Harding was anxious to answer, and yet he did not wish to treat his invalid roughly!Would he ever be a convalescent?"
"工程师每时每刻都在注意着他！如果可以这样形容，他是如此注意他的灵魂！他多想去抓住它！居民们都带着真实的同情注意着哈丁对其进行治疗的每一个阶段。他们也在人性方面帮助他，并且所有人都和哈丁一样，很快就满怀希望和信心，可能只有潘克洛夫有些怀疑。","How the engineer observed him every moment!How he was on the watch for his soul, if one may use the expression!How he was ready to grasp it!The settlers followed with real sympathy all the phases of the cure undertaken by Harding.They aided him also in this work of humanity, and all, except perhaps the incredulous Pencroft, soon shared both his hope and his faith."
"如上所说，陌生人很平静，他甚至会表示出对工程师的依赖，很明显，他已经感受到了哈丁对他的影响。赛勒斯·哈丁决定在他身上下工夫，将他带到另一个地点，从他以前眼睛习惯注视的大海，转移到树林的边缘，也许森林会让他想起生活多年的地方的事情。","The calm of the stranger was deep, as has been said, and he even showed a sort of attachment for the engineer, whose influence he evidently felt.Cyrus Harding resolved then to try him, by transporting him to another scene, from that ocean which formerly his eyes had been accustomed to contemplate, to the border of the forest, which might perhaps recall those where so many years of his life had been passed!"
"“可是，”吉丁·史佩莱说，“一旦他获得自由，我们能期待他不会逃走吗？”","“But,” said Gideon Spilett, “can we hope that he will not escape, if once set at liberty?”"
"“我们必须试一下。”工程师说。","“The experiment must be tried,” replied the engineer."
"“好！”潘克洛夫说，“那个家伙出去后，呼吸到新鲜空气，他就会撒开两腿尽快地跑掉！”","“Well!” said Pencroft.“When that fellow is outside, and feels the fresh air, he will be off as fast as his legs can carry him!”"
"“我不这样认为。”哈丁回答。","“I do not think so,” returned Harding."
"“我们就尝试一下吧。”史佩莱说。","“Let us try,” said Spilett."
"“那就试一下吧。”工程师回答。","“We will try,” replied the engineer."
"那天是10月30日，至此，达抱岛上的遇难者作为囚徒在花岗岩宫里呆了九天了。这一天很暖和，明媚的阳光发出光芒，照耀着这个小岛。赛勒斯·哈丁和潘克洛夫进入了陌生人的房间，只看见他躺在窗边，注视着天空。","This was on the 30th of October, and consequently the castaway of Tabor Island had been a prisoner in Granite House for nine days.It was warm, and a bright sun darted its rays on the island.Cyrus Harding and Pencroft went to the room occupied by the stranger, who was found lying near the window and gazing at the sky."
"“过来，我的朋友。”工程师对他说。","“Come, my friend,” said the engineer to him."
"陌生人马上站了起来。他的眼睛注视着赛勒斯·哈丁，并跟在他的后面，而水手跟在他俩的后面，对试验的结果不抱什么希望。","The stranger rose immediately.His eyes were fixed on Cyrus Harding, and he followed him, while the sailor marched behind them, little confident as to the result of the experiment."
"到了门口，哈丁和潘克洛夫让他在升降梯就座，纳布、赫伯特和吉丁·史佩莱已在花岗石宫前等着他们。升降梯下滑了，一会儿，所有人都聚集在了沙滩上。","Arrived at the door, Harding and Pencroft made him take his place in the lift, while Neb, Herbert, and Gideon Spilett waited for them before Granite House.The lift descended, and in a few moments all were united on the beach."
"居民们离开了陌生人一段距离，为了让他自由行动。","The settlers went a short distance from the stranger, so as to leave him at liberty."
"接着，他朝向海边走了几步，面部充满生气，容光焕发，可是，他丝毫没有想要逃跑。他注视着被小岛阻断的、细小的海浪，在沙滩上留下道道涟漪。","He then made a few steps toward the sea, and his look brightened with extreme animation, but he did not make the slightest attempt to escape.He was gazing at the little waves which, broken by the islet, rippled on the sand."
"“这只是大海，”吉丁·史佩莱说，“可能不会引起他想要逃跑的念头！”","“This is only the sea,” observed Gideon Spilett, “and possibly it does not inspire him with any wish to escape!”"
"“是的，”哈丁回答，“我们必须把他带到树林旁边的高地上。在那儿试验会更有决定性。”","“Yes,” replied Harding, “we must take him to the plateau, on the border of the forest.There the experiment will be more conclusive.”"
"“而且，他也逃不走，”纳布说，“因为桥已经拉起来了。”","“Besides, he could not run away,” said Neb, “since the bridge is raised.”"
"“啊！”潘克洛夫说，“这不是一个会受像甘油河阻挡的人！他只要一跳，就能立即过去！”","“Oh!” said Pencroft, “that isn’t a man to be troubled by a stream like Creek Glycerine!He could cross it directly, at a single bound!”"
"“我们很快就知道了。”哈丁满意地回答，眼睛始终没有从患者身上离开。","“We shall soon see,” Harding contented himself with replying, his eyes not quitting those of his patient."
"于是，他们就把他带到慈悲河口，所有人都爬上了河流的左岸，来到了眺望岗。","The latter was then led towards the mouth of the Mercy, and all climbing the left bank of the river, reached Prospect Heights."
"这里生长着林中最美丽的树木，树叶让微风吹得微微晃动。到达现场后，陌生人好像在贪婪地呼吸着大气里沁人心脾的芬芳，从胸中呼出了长长的一口气。","Arrived at the spot on which grew the first beautiful trees of the forest, their foliage slightly agitated by the breeze, the stranger appeared greedily to drink in the penetrating odor which filled the atmosphere, and a long sigh escaped from his chest."
"居民们一直跟在他后面，如果他有任何逃走的动作，就准备把他抓住！","The settlers kept behind him, ready to seize him if he made any movement to escape!"
"事实上，这个可怜的人正要跳进横在他和森林之间的小河里，他一瞬间把腿弯下来，像是要跳，但是，几乎马上又退了回来，半蹲着，一大颗泪珠从他眼里掉了下来。","And, indeed, the poor creature was on the point of springing into the creek which separated him from the forest, and his legs were bent for an instant as if for a spring, but almost immediately he stepped back, half sank down, and a large tear fell from his eyes."
"“啊！”赛勒斯·哈丁大喊，“你又变成人了，因为你会流泪了！”","“Ah!” exclaimed Cyrus Harding, “you have become a man again, for you can weep!”"
"第十六章","Chapter 16"
"是的！这个不幸的人流泪了！一些回忆肯定闪过他的大脑，用赛勒斯·哈丁的话说，从那些眼泪可以看出，他再次变成一个人了。","Yes! the unfortunate man had wept!Some recollection doubtless had flashed across his brain, and to use Cyrus Harding’s expression, by those tears he was once more a man."
"开拓者们让他在高地上独自呆了一会儿，他们退到不远处，这样他可能就感觉自己是自由的了，但是他不认为自己利用了这次自由，哈丁很快就把他带回花岗石宫了。在这件事发生两天后，陌生人似乎渐渐地想要融入他们的共同生活了。明显地，他在听别人说话，也听得懂，但也很明显的是，他很奇怪地坚决不和开拓者们说话。因为有天晚上，潘克洛夫站在他的房间门口听，只听到他说出了这样的话：","The colonists left him for some time on the plateau, and withdrew themselves to a short distance, so that he might feel himself free; but he did not think of profiting by this liberty, and Harding soon brought him back to Granite House.Two days after this occurrence, the stranger appeared to wish gradually to mingle with their common life.He evidently heard and understood, but no less evidently was he strangely determined not to speak to the colonists; for one evening, Pencroft, listening at the door of his room, heard these words escape from his lips:—"
"“不！这里！我！决不！”","“No! here!I! never!”"
"水手将这些话传达给了同伴。","The sailor reported these words to his companions."
"“他一定在那里经历了痛苦而神秘的往事！”哈丁说。","“There is some painful mystery there!” said Harding."
"陌生人开始使用劳动工具在菜园里工作了。当他停下手中的活时，他就会独处沉思，这在他是常有的事。可是，遵从工程师的建议，大家没有打扰他，显然他是愿意保持孤独的。如果居民中有人要靠近他，他就会后退，喘起气来胸脯一耸一耸的，好像负担很重似的。","The stranger had begun to use the laboring tools, and he worked in the garden.When he stopped in his work, as was often the case, he remained retired within himself, but on the engineer’s recommendation, they respected the reserve which he apparently wished to keep.If one of the settlers approached him, he drew back, and his chest heaved with sobs, as if overburdened!"
"是悔恨把他打击成这样的吗？他们不得不这样想，有一天，吉丁·史佩莱禁不住说：","Was it remorse that overwhelmed him thus?They were compelled to believe so, and Gideon Spilett could not help one day making this observation,—"
"“他之所以不说，恐怕是因为事情过于严重而说不出口！”","“If he does not speak it is because he has, I fear, things too serious to be told!”"
"他们必须耐心地等待。","They must be patient and wait."
"几天后，也就是11月3日，在高原上工作的陌生人停了下来，手中的铁锹也掉落到地上。在不远处一直观察他的哈丁看见，泪水再次从他眼中淌了出来。一种无法抗拒的同情之心让他走向这个不幸的人，并轻轻地触摸他的手臂。","A few days later, on the 3rd of November, the stranger, working on the plateau, had stopped, letting his spade drop to the ground, and Harding, who was observing him from a little distance, saw that tears were again flowing from his eyes.A sort of irresistible pity led him towards the unfortunate man, and he touched his arm lightly."
"“我的朋友！”他说。","“My friend!” said he."
"陌生人试图避开他的目光，当赛勒斯·哈丁试图去抓他的手时，他却快速缩回去了。","The stranger tried to avoid his look, and Cyrus Harding having endeavored to take his hand, he drew back quickly."
"“我的朋友，”哈丁用更坚定的口吻说，“我希望你看着我！”","“My friend,” said Harding in a firmer voice, “look at me, I wish it!”"
"陌生人看着工程师，似乎在哈丁的力量下屈服了，就好像物体在磁石的影响之下。他想要逃跑。不过，他的表情突然一变。他的眼睛闪着亮光。许多话争着从他的嘴里迸出来。他再也抑制不住自己了！最后，他把手臂折在一起，用低沉的嗓音问赛勒斯·哈丁：“你们是谁？”","The stranger looked at the engineer, and seemed to be under his power, as a subject under the influence of a mesmerist.He wished to run away.But then his countenance suddenly underwent a transformation.His eyes flashed.Words struggled to escape from his lips.He could no longer contain himself!At last he folded his arms; then, in a hollow voice,—“Who are you?” he asked Cyrus Harding."
"“落难者，和你一样，”工程师感慨万分地回答，“我们将你带到这里来，带到你的同胞中来了。”","“Castaways, like you,” replied the engineer, whose emotion was deep.“We have brought you here, among your fellow-men.”"
"“我的同胞……我没有！”","“My fellow-men!....I have none!”"
"“你就在朋友们中间。”","“You are in the midst of friends.”"
"“朋友！对我！我的朋友！”陌生人双手捂着脸大喊，“不——绝不——走开！走开！”","“Friends!—for me! friends!” exclaimed the stranger, hiding his face in his hands.“No—never—leave me! leave me!”"
"他接着冲向面向大海的高地边缘，一动不动地在那里呆了很久。","Then he rushed to the side of the plateau which overlooked the sea, and remained there a long time motionless."
"哈丁重新回到他的同伴中间，并向他们讲述了刚才发生的事情。","Harding rejoined his companions and related to them what had just happened."
"“是的！这个人一生准有一个谜，”吉丁·史佩莱说，“他好像是个经过忏悔重新进入社会的人。”","“Yes! there is some mystery in that man’s life,” said Gideon Spilett, “and it appears as if he had only re-entered society by the path of remorse.”"
"“我不知道我们带过来的是个什么样的人，”水手说，“他有秘密——”","“I don’t know what sort of a man we have brought here,” said the sailor.“He has secrets—”"
"“我们要尊重他的秘密，”赛勒斯·哈丁很快打断他们说，“如果他犯了什么罪，他也已经用非常痛苦的方式弥补了，在我们眼中，他是无罪的。”","“Which we will respect,” interrupted Cyrus Harding quickly.“If he has committed any crime, he has most fearfully expiated it, and in our eyes he is absolved.”"
"陌生人独自在海岸上逗留了两个小时，显然，在回忆的影响下，他回想起了自己过去的所有生活——无疑是忧郁的过去。开拓者们寸步不离地跟着他，但是并不想打扰他独处。然而，两个小时后，他似乎是下定决心，过来找赛勒斯·哈丁。他的眼睛因为刚才流泪而变红了，不过他不再哭泣了。他的面部表情极度谦卑。他好像很焦虑、胆怯、惭愧，眼睛一直盯着地面。","For two hours the stranger remained alone on the shore, evidently under the influence of recollections which recalled all his past life—a melancholy life doubtless—and the colonists, without losing sight of him, did not attempt to disturb his solitude.However, after two hours, appearing to have formed a resolution, he came to find Cyrus Harding.His eyes were red with the tears he had shed, but he wept no longer.His countenance expressed deep humility.He appeared anxious, timorous, ashamed, and his eyes were constantly fixed on the ground."
"“先生，”他对哈丁说，“你和你的同伴，是英国人吗？”","“Sir,” said he to Harding, “your companions and you, are you English?”"
"“不是，”工程师回答说，“我们是美国人。”","“No,” answered the engineer, “we are Americans.”"
"“啊！”陌生人说，然后又低声咕哝说，“我更喜欢听到这一点！”","“Ah!” said the stranger, and he murmured, “I prefer that!”"
"“那你呢，我的朋友？”工程师说。","“And you, my friend?” asked the engineer."
"“英国人。”他急切地回答。","“English,” replied he hastily."
"好像这几个词语很难说出口，他退回到海滩上，在瀑布和慈悲河口之间极其不安地走来走去。","And as if these few words had been difficult to say, he retreated to the beach, where he walked up and down between the cascade and the mouth of the Mercy, in a state of extreme agitation."
"后来，过了一会儿，他走近赫伯特，停了下来，压低了嗓子，问道：","Then, passing one moment close to Herbert, he stopped and in a stifled voice,—"
"“是哪个月了？”","“What month?” he asked."
"“12月。”赫伯特回答。","“December,” replied Herbert."
"“哪一年？”","“What year?”"
"“1866年。”","“1866.”"
"“12年了！12年了！”他大喊。","“Twelve years! twelve years!” he exclaimed."
"接着他突然离开了赫伯特。","Then he left him abruptly."
"赫伯特将他们之间的对话告诉了其他开拓者。","Herbert reported to the colonists the questions and answers which had been made."
"“这个不幸的人，”吉丁·史佩莱说，“早就忘了年月！”","“This unfortunate man,” observed Gideon Spilett, “was no longer acquainted with either months or years!”"
"“是！”赫伯特接着说，“我们在小岛上找到他的时候，他已经在那儿呆了12年了！”","“Yes!” added Herbert, “and he had been twelve years already on the islet when we found him there!”"
"“12年！”哈丁说，“啊！一段罪恶的生活之后，忍受12年的孤独，这可能会摧残一个人的理智！”","“Twelve years!” rejoined Harding.“Ah! twelve years of solitude, after a wicked life, perhaps, may well impair a man’s reason!”"
"“我认为，”潘克洛夫说，“这个人不是在达抱岛上遇难的，而是因为犯了罪被放逐到那里的。”","“I am induced to think,” said Pencroft, “that this man was not wrecked on Tabor Island, but that in consequence of some crime he was left there.”"
"“你说的没错，潘克洛夫，”记者回答，“如果真是这样，那些把他留在岛上的人，可能有一天会再回来把他带走的！”","“You must be right, Pencroft,” replied the reporter, “and if it is so it is not impossible that those who left him on the island may return to fetch him some day!”"
"“那时候，他们就再找不到他了。”赫伯特说。","“And they will no longer find him,” said Herbert."
"“不过，”潘克洛夫说，“他们一定会回来，那么——”","“But then,” added Pencroft, “they must return, and—”"
"“我的朋友，”赛勒斯·哈丁说，“在我们进一步了解以前，就不要再讨论这个问题了。我认为这个不幸的人受到了折磨，他已经用最可怕的方式弥补了自己的过失——不管他犯了什么样的过失，并且想释放自己的愿望令他苦闷。我们不要强迫他说出自己的过去！他肯定会告诉我们的，等我们知道以后，我们就知道怎样做是最好的了。他能告诉我们，是否他盼着终有一天能够回到自己的祖国，不过，我对此表示怀疑。”","“My friends,” said Cyrus Harding, “do not let us discuss this question until we know more about it.I believe that the unhappy man has suffered, that he has severely expiated his faults, whatever they may have been, and that the wish to unburden himself stifles him.Do not let us press him to tell us his history!He will tell it to us doubtless, and when we know it, we shall see what course it will be best to follow.He alone besides can tell us, if he has more than a hope, a certainty, of returning some day to his country, but I doubt it!”"
"“为什么？”记者问。","“And why?” asked the reporter."
"“因为如果他确信自己有一天会被解救，那么他就会等着解救时间的到来，而不会将纸条扔到大海里去了。不，更有可能的是，他被判终生留在那个小岛上，他也绝不会期望再次见到他的同伴！”","“Because that, in the event of his being sure of being delivered at a certain time, he would have waited the hour of his deliverance and would not have thrown this document into the sea.No, it is more probable that he was condemned to die on that islet, and that he never expected to see his fellow-creatures again!”"
"“不过，”水手说，“还有一件事情我不明白。”","“But,” observed the sailor, “there is one thing which I cannot explain.”"
"“是什么事情？”","“What is it?”"
"“如果这个人在达抱岛上呆了12年了，我们完全可以认为，在我们发现他的时候，他已经变成野人好几年了！”","“If this man had been left for twelve years on Tabor Island, one may well suppose that he had been several years already in the wild state in which we found him!”"
"“这很有可能。”赛勒斯·哈丁回答说。","“That is probable,” replied Cyrus Harding."
"“他写那张纸条也一定是多年以前了吧！”","“It must then be many years since he wrote that document!”"
"“毫无疑问。”但那张纸条看起来是最近写的！","“No doubt,” and yet the document appears to have been recently written!"
"“而且，你是怎么知道装着纸条的瓶子，不是经过好几年从达抱岛漂到林肯岛上的呢？”","“Besides, how do you know that the bottle which enclosed the document may not have taken several years to come from Tabor Island to Lincoln Island?”"
"“这并不是完全不可能。”记者回答。","“That is not absolutely impossible,” replied the reporter."
"“它会不会在这个小岛的海岸上很长时间了呢？”","“Might it not have been a long time already on the coast of the island?”"
"“不可能，”潘克洛夫说，“因为他当时是漂着的。我们也不能认为，这个瓶子在海岸上停留了一段时间后，还会被海水冲走，因为南海岸全是岩石，在那里肯定会被撞得粉碎的！”","“No,” answered Pencroft, “for it was still floating.We could not even suppose that after it had stayed for any length of time on the shore, it would have been swept off by the sea, for the south coast is all rocks, and it would certainly have been smashed to pieces there!”"
"“的确是这样。”赛勒斯·哈丁若有所思地说。","“That is true,” rejoined Cyrus Harding thoughtfully."
"“还有，”水手接着说，“如果这张纸条是很多年前的，如果在那个瓶子里被封了好几年了，那也会因潮湿而被损坏的。现在情形完全不是那样，我们发现的时候，它完好无损。”","“And then,” continued the sailor, “if the document was several years old, if it had been shut up in that bottle for several years, it would have been injured by damp.Now, there is nothing of the kind, and it was found in a perfect state of preservation.”"
"水手的推理非常合理，同时也指出一个无法理解的事实，那就是当开拓者发现这个瓶子的时候，这个纸条好像是最近才写上去的。另外，上面给出了达抱岛正确的经度和纬度，这意味着与普通的水手相比，写纸条的人懂得更全面的水文知识。","The sailor’s reasoning was very just, and pointed out an incomprehensible fact, for the document appeared to have been recently written, when the colonists found it in the bottle.Moreover, it gave the latitude and longitude of Tabor Island correctly, which implied that its author had a more complete knowledge of hydrography than could be expected of a common sailor."
"“这里面还有一些是无法解释的，”工程师说，“但是我们不能急着让我们的同伴开口。”我的朋友，当他想说的时候，我们准备倾听就可以了！”","“There is in this, again, something unaccountable,” said the engineer, “but we will not urge our companions to speak.When he likes, my friends, then we shall be ready to hear him!”"
"接下来的几天，陌生人一句话也没说，也没有离开过高原的区域。他一直不停地工作，一刻也不浪费，一分钟也不休息，不过他总是在一个僻静的地方。吃饭时他从不去花岗石宫，虽然大家几次叫他去，但是他只是满足于吃一些生蔬菜。傍晚时候，他不回给他指定的房间，而是呆在几丛树下。天气不好时，他就蹲在岩石的缝隙中。因此，他还是和以前在达抱岛上的生活方式一样，当时他只把森林当住所。所有劝说他要改善生活的努力都是徒劳的，所以开拓者们只好耐心地等待着。当这个时刻临近的时候，他似乎是受良心不由自主的驱使，作出了可怕的坦白。","During the following days the stranger did not speak a word, and did not once leave the precincts of the plateau.He worked away, without losing a moment, without taking a minute’s rest, but always in a retired place.At meal times he never came to Granite House, although invited several times to do so, but contented himself with eating a few raw vegetables.At nightfall he did not return to the room assigned to him, but remained under some clump of trees, or when the weather was bad crouched in some cleft of the rocks.Thus he lived in the same manner as when he had no other shelter than the forests of Tabor Island, and as all persuasion to induce him to improve his life was in vain, the colonists waited patiently.And the time was near, when, as it seemed, almost involuntarily urged by his conscience, a terrible confession escaped him."
"11月10日，大约晚上八点的时候，天快黑了，当时大家都聚在平台上，陌生人出其不意地出现在居民们的面前。他的眼睛发出奇异的光芒，并且他又恢复到最糟糕的日子里野蛮的一面。","On the 10th of November, about eight o’clock in the evening, as night was coming on, the stranger appeared unexpectedly before the settlers, who were assembled under the veranda.His eyes burned strangely, and he had quite resumed the wild aspect of his worst days."
"在一种强烈的感情影响下，他的牙齿在打颤，就像一个发烧的病人一样，赛勒斯·哈丁和他的同伴看到这个场景后，大吃一惊。他怎么了？看到同类，他忍受不了吗？他厌烦回到文明的生存方式吗？他还怀念以前的原始生活吗？看起来是这样的，很快他们就听到他用不连贯的句子表达自己，说道：","Cyrus Harding and his companions were astounded on seeing that, overcome by some terrible emotion, his teeth chattered like those of a person in a fever.What was the matter with him?Was the sight of his fellow-creatures insupportable to him?Was he weary of this return to a civilized mode of existence?Was he pining for his former savage life?It appeared so, as soon he was heard to express himself in these incoherent sentences:—"
"“我为什么会在这里？你们有什么权利把我从我的小岛带到这里？你们认为我和你们之间有任何关系吗？你们知道我是谁，知道我做过什么吗，知道我为什么一个人在那里吗？是谁告诉你们我不是被遗弃在那里的，不是被判令老死在那里的？你们知道我的过去吗？你们怎么知道我没有偷盗，没有谋杀，我不是一个恶棍，一个被诅咒的人，只适合像野兽那样生活的人，远离一切的人，说——你们知道吗？”","“Why am I here?....By what right have you dragged me from my islet?....Do you think there could be any tie between you and me?....Do you know who I am—what I have done—why I was there—alone?And who told you that I was not abandoned there—that I was not condemned to die there?....Do you know my past?....How do you know that I have not stolen, murdered—that I am not a wretch—an accursed being—only fit to live like a wild beast, far from all—speak—do you know it?”"
"开拓者们静静地听着，没有打断这个悲惨的人说的话，可以说，他失去了控制，断断续续进行了坦白。哈丁想要让他冷静下来，向他走近，可是他快速退回去了。","The colonists listened without interrupting the miserable creature, from whom these broken confessions escaped, as it were, in spite of himself.Harding wishing to calm him, approached him, but he hastily drew back."
"“不！不！”他大喊，“只问一句，我是自由的吗？”","“No! no!” he exclaimed; “one word only—am I free?”"
"“你是自由的。”工程师回答。","“You are free,” answered the engineer."
"“那么，再见！”他叫喊，像个疯子似的逃走了。","“Farewell, then!” he cried, and fled like a madman."
"纳布、潘克洛夫和赫伯特也跑向树林边缘，但是却没有带回那个野人。","Neb, Pencroft, and Herbert ran also towards the edge of the wood—but they returned alone."
"“我们必须让他一个人呆一会儿！”赛勒斯·哈丁说。","“We must let him alone!” said Cyrus Harding."
"“他不会再回来了！”潘克洛夫喊。","“He will never come back!” exclaimed Pencroft."
"“他会回来的。”工程师回答。","“He will come back,” replied the engineer."
"好几天过去了，可是，哈丁总有强烈的预感，这个不幸的人迟早会回来的。","Many days passed; but Harding—was it a sort of presentiment?—presentiment in the fixed idea that sooner or later the unhappy man would return."
"“这是他的野性最后一次发作，”他说，“悔恨又触动了他，再过孤独生活会压制他的野性。","“It is the last revolt of his wild nature,” said he, “which remorse has touched, and which renewed solitude will terrify.”"
"同时，眺望角和畜栏里所有的工作都照旧进行，哈丁打算在那里建一个农场。毋庸置疑，赫伯特从达抱岛上采集来的种子已经小心地种上了。这样，高地变成了一个巨大的菜园，布局良好，并受到他们的精心照料，所以居民们的手从来没有闲过。总是有做不完的工作要做。可食用的东西数量增加了，扩大简单的园地也变得有必要了，园地有可能长成常规的菜地，取代草地。好在大量的草长在了小岛的其他地方，不用担心野驴会跑到这里来食草。还有，将眺望岗变成一个菜园是很值得的，因为这个菜园由很深的护河带保护着，并且将菜园搬到草地上，就没必要防御灵长类动物和四足兽来掠夺它。","In the meanwhile, works of all sorts were continued, as well on Prospect Heights as at the corral, where Harding intended to build a farm.It is unnecessary to say that the seeds collected by Herbert on Tabor Island had been carefully sown.The plateau thus formed one immense kitchen-garden, well laid out and carefully tended, so that the arms of the settlers were never in want of work.There was always something to be done.As the esculents increased in number, it became necessary to enlarge the simple beds, which threatened to grow into regular fields and replace the meadows.But grass abounded in other parts of the island, and there was no fear of the onagers being obliged to go on short allowance.It was well worth while, besides, to turn Prospect Heights into a kitchen-garden, defended by its deep belt of creeks, and to remove them to the meadows, which had no need of protection against the depredations of quadrumana and quadrapeds."
"11月15日是第三次收获的日子。18个月前，他们只种了一粒小麦，现在麦田变得多么广阔啊！第二次种下的60万粒种子,这次产了4000蒲式耳，也就是5亿粒麦了！","On the 15th of November, the third harvest was gathered in.How wonderfully had the field increased in extent, since eighteen months ago, when the first grain of wheat was sown!The second crop of six hundred thousand grains produced this time four thousand bushels, or five hundred millions of grains!"
"这块开拓地谷物丰富，每年仅种十蒲式耳就足以产出够人类和野兽食用的作物了。收获完成后，11月最后两星期，他们投入到把庄稼变成人类的食物的工作中。实际上，他们有了小麦，但这不是面粉，因此有必要建一个磨坊。赛勒斯·哈丁本可以利用第二个流入慈悲河的瀑布产生动力，第一个瀑布已经用作了制毡厂的动力，但是，经过协商后，他们决定在眺望岗上建一个简单的风磨。现在建造的这个与以前建的那个一样简单，而且可以确定的是，由于高地面对海上吹来的微风，那里风是不缺的。","The colony was rich in corn, for ten bushels alone were sufficient for sowing every year to produce an ample crop for the food both of men and beasts.The harvest was completed, and the last fortnight of the month of November was devoted to the work of converting it into food for man.In fact, they had corn, but not flour, and the establishment of a mill was necessary.Cyrus Harding could have utilized the second fall which flowed into the Mercy to establish his motive power, the first being already occupied with moving the felting mill, but, after some consultation, it was decided that a simple windmill should be built on Prospect Heights.The building of this presented no more difficulty than the building of the former, and it was moreover certain that there would be no want of wind on the plateau, exposed as it was to the sea breezes."
"“不用说，”潘克洛夫说，“在这块场地上，这个风磨会更有活力，效果会很好！”","“Not to mention,” said Pencroft, “that the windmill will be more lively and will have a good effect in the landscape!”"
"他们开始认真工作，为磨坊的框架和机械选择木材。他们在湖的北边找到几块大石头，可以轻而易举地变成磨石。至于风翼，气囊上那些用不完的布料充当了必要的材料。","They set to work by choosing timber for the frame and machinery of the mill.Some large stones, found at the north of the lake, could be easily transformed into millstones, and as to the sails, the inexhaustible case of the balloon furnished the necessary material."
"赛勒斯·哈丁设计出他的模型，磨坊地址选在靠近湖岸的地方，家禽饲养场靠右一点的位置。结实的木料支撑着一个转轴，框架就安装在那个转轴上，这样，它就可以根据风向和上面所有的机械一同旋转了。工作进展得很迅速。纳布和潘克洛夫成了技术熟练的木匠，他们只要按照工程师给他们的模型做就可以了。","Cyrus Harding made his model, and the site of the mill was chosen a little to the right of the poultry-yard, near the shore of the lake.The frame was to rest on a pivot supported with strong timbers, so that it could turn with all the machinery it contained according as the wind required it.The work advanced rapidly.Neb and Pencroft had become very skilful carpenters, and had nothing to do but to copy the models provided by the engineer."
"一会儿，他们就在选定的地点竖起一个圆柱形的盒子来，形状像一个胡椒瓶，屋顶尖尖的。用来做过帆的四根风翼被铁夹牢固地定在中央轴上，这样就与中央轴形成一个固定的角度。内部的各个部分包括：一个盒子，用于放两块磨石，一块是固定的，另一块是活动的；一只漏斗，这是一只大的、正方形的水槽，上宽下窄，可以让谷物漏到石头上；一个振荡槽，用来把麦粒灌入磨眼；最后是筛粉机，经过筛选过程，可以筛出面粉留下皮，这些都轻而易举地造好了。工具很好用，并且工作也不难，事实上，磨坊上的机械非常简单。这只是时间的问题。","Soon a sort of cylindrical box, in shape like a pepper-pot, with a pointed roof, rose on the spot chosen.The four frames which formed the sails had been firmly fixed in the center beam, so as to form a certain angle with it, and secured with iron clamps.As to the different parts of the internal mechanism, the box destined to contain the two millstones, the fixed stone and the moving stone, the hopper, a sort of large square trough, wide at the top, narrow at the bottom, which would allow the grain to fall on the stones, the oscillating spout intended to regulate the passing of the grain, and lastly the bolting machine, which by the operation of sifting, separates the bran from the flour, were made without difficulty.The tools were good, and the work not difficult, for in reality, the machinery of a mill is very simple.This was only a question of time."
"每个人都在忙着建造磨坊，12月1日，磨坊完工了。和往常一样，潘克洛夫对自己的工作很满意，他确信这个装置是十分完美的。","Every one had worked at the construction of the mill, and on the 1st of December it was finished.As usual, Pencroft was delighted with his work, and had no doubt that the apparatus was perfect."
"“现在刮一阵好风，”他说，“我们就会很好地磨出第一次收的麦子！”","“Now for a good wind,” said he, “and we shall grind our first harvest splendidly!”"
"“合适的风向，肯定是，”工程师回答，“但是不要太多，潘克洛夫。”","“A good wind, certainly,” answered the engineer, “but not too much, Pencroft.”"
"“呸！我们的风车只会转得更快！”","“Pooh! our mill would only go the faster!”"
"“没有必要让它转那么快。”赛勒斯·哈丁回答，“由经验得知，风翼在一分钟旋转的次数是风在一秒钟走的英尺数的六倍时，磨坊的工作量最大。如果一阵和缓的风每秒走24英尺，就可以让风翼在一分钟内转16圈，不需要转更多圈。”","“There is no need for it to go so very fast,” replied Cyrus Harding.“It is known by experience that the greatest quantity of work is performed by a mill when the number of turns made by the sails in a minute is six times the number of feet traversed by the wind in a second.A moderate breeze, which passes over twenty-four feet to the second, will give sixteen turns to the sails during a minute, and there is no need of more.”"
"“一点儿不错！”赫伯特喊，“一阵和煦的清风从东北方向吹来，很快就可以为我们完成工作了。”","“Exactly!” cried Herbert, “a fine breeze is blowing from the northeast, which will soon do our business for us.”"
"没有理由延迟这个磨坊的落成典礼，因为居民们急切地想品尝林肯岛上的第一片面包。这天早上，他们磨了两三蒲式耳小麦，第二天吃早餐时，花岗石宫的桌子上就摆上了一大块面包，虽然经过发酵，但也许不够松软。每个人都吃得津津有味，这是很容易理解的。","There was no reason for delaying the inauguration of the mill, for the settlers were eager to taste the first piece of bread in Lincoln Island.On this morning two or three bushels of wheat were ground, and the next day at breakfast a magnificent loaf, a little heavy perhaps, although raised with yeast, appeared on the table at Granite House.Every one munched away at it with a pleasure which may be easily understood."
"在此期间，陌生人一直没有出现。吉丁·史佩莱和赫伯特在花岗岩石附近的森林里找了好几次，都没有碰到他，也没有发现他的踪迹。大家因为他长期不归而感到非常不安。可以肯定的是，先前生活在达抱岛上的野人，不可能为怎样在森林中生存而困惑，但可怕的是，如果他已经恢复了他的习惯，如果这种自由的生活让他野蛮的本性复发，那可怎么办？然而，哈丁利用某种预感，毫无疑问，总坚持说这个逃跑的人会回来的。","In the meanwhile, the stranger had not reappeared.Several times Gideon Spilett and Herbert searched the forest in the neighborhood of Granite House, without meeting or finding any trace of him.They became seriously uneasy at this prolonged absence.Certainly, the former savage of Tabor island could not be perplexed how to live in the forest, abounding in game, but was it not to be feared that he had resumed his habits, and that this freedom would revive in him his wild instincts?However, Harding, by a sort of presentiment, doubtless, always persisted in saying that the fugitive would return."
"“是的，他会回来的！”他很有信心地重复着这句话，他的同伴却并不赞同。“这个不幸的人在达抱岛上的时候，他知道自己是孤独的！而在这里，他知道伙伴们在等着他！既然他讲了他过去生活的一部分，那么这个可怜的忏悔者会回来讲完完整的经历，到那时候，他就属于我们的一员了！”","“Yes, he will return!” he repeated with a confidence which his companions could not share.“When this unfortunate man was on Tabor Island, he knew himself to be alone!Here, he knows that fellow-men are awaiting him!Since he has partially spoken of his past life, the poor penitent will return to tell the whole, and from that day he will belong to us!”"
"接下来的事情证实了赛勒斯·哈丁的预言。12月3日，赫伯特离开了高原，到湖的南岸钓鱼去了。他没有带武器，也没有采取任何防御措施，因为小岛的这一带没有出现过危险动物。","The event justified Cyrus Harding’s predictions.On the 3rd of December, Herbert had left the plateau to go and fish on the southern bank of the lake.He was unarmed, and till then had never taken any precautions for defense, as dangerous animals had not shown themselves on that part of the island."
"在这期间，潘克洛夫和纳布在家禽饲养场工作，哈丁和记者正在“石窟”里忙着制作苏打，因为储存的肥皂已经用完了。","Meanwhile, Pencroft and Neb were working in the poultry-yard, while Harding and the reporter were occupied at the Chimneys in making soda, the store of soap being exhausted."
"突然，有叫喊声回响：","Suddenly cries resounded,—"
"“救命啊！救命啊！”","“Help! help!”"
"赛勒斯·哈丁和记者因为离得太远，没有听到喊声。潘克洛夫和纳布匆忙离开饲养场，冲向湖边。","Cyrus Harding and the reporter, being at too great a distance, had not been able to hear the shouts.Pencroft and Neb, leaving the poultry-yard in all haste, rushed towards the lake."
"在此之前，陌生人已经穿过了高原和树林之间的甘油河，纵身跃上了对岸，谁也没有想到这个陌生人竟会从这里出现在他们面前。","But before then, the stranger, whose presence at this place no one had suspected, crossed Creek Glycerine, which separated the plateau from the forest, and bounded up the opposite bank."
"赫伯特和凶猛的美洲豹面对着面，那只豹与在爬虫角杀死的那只差不多。突然受到惊吓，他背靠着一棵树站在那里，这时候，野兽弓起身子，想要扑过去。","Herbert was there face to face with a fierce jaguar, similar to the one which had been killed on Reptile End.Suddenly surprised, he was standing with his back against a tree, while the animal gathering itself together was about to spring."
"可是，陌生人手中只有一把刀子，没有别的武器，他冲向这个可怕的动物，野兽转身迎上新的敌人。","But the stranger, with no other weapon than a knife, rushed on the formidable animal, who turned to meet this new adversary."
"搏斗的过程很短。陌生人拥有惊人的力量和活力。他伸出一只强大的手，一下子掐住了美洲豹的喉咙，就像用钳子夹着一样，但是没有阻止这个野兽用爪子撕他的肉，他用另一只手直接将刀子插进那野兽的心脏。","The struggle was short.The stranger possessed immense strength and activity.He seized the jaguar’s throat with one powerful hand, holding it as in a vise, without heeding the beast’s claws which tore his flesh, and with the other he plunged his knife into its heart."
"美洲豹倒下去了。陌生人一脚踢开它的尸体，刚要离开，这时候居民们都到了战斗场地，赫伯特抱住他，大喊：","The jaguar fell.The stranger kicked away the body, and was about to fly at the moment when the settlers arrived on the field of battle, but Herbert, clinging to him, cried,—"
"“不，不！你不能走！”","“No, no! you shall not go!”"
"哈丁朝陌生人走去，当他看到哈丁走近时，他皱起了眉头。鲜血透过撕裂的衬衫淌了出来，但他没有在意。","Harding advanced towards the stranger, who frowned when he saw him approaching.The blood flowed from his shoulder under his torn shirt, but he took no notice of it."
"“我的朋友，”赛勒斯·活动说，“我们欠你一个人情。你冒着生命危险救了我们的小男孩！”","“My friend,” said Cyrus Harding, “we have just contracted a debt of gratitude to you.To save our boy you have risked your life!”"
"“我的生命！”陌生人嘟哝着说，“那有什么价值可言？一文不值！”","“My life!” murmured the stranger.“What is that worth?Less than nothing!”"
"“你受伤了？”","“You are wounded?”"
"“没关系。”","“It is no matter.”"
"“你能把手伸给我吗？”","“Will you give me your hand?”"
"赫伯特正打算去抓住这只刚才救过自己的手，陌生人突然合起双臂，他的胸膛在起伏，脸色沉了下来，似乎是想要逃走，但是经过一番激烈的自我斗争，他用急促的口气说道：","And as Herbert endeavored to seize the hand which had just saved him, the stranger folded his arms, his chest heaved, his look darkened, and he appeared to wish to escape, but making a violent effort over himself, and in an abrupt tone,—"
"“你们是谁？”他问，“说给我听听吧？”","“Who are you?” he asked, “and what do you claim to be to me?”"
"他还是第一次要求开拓者们讲述他们的历史。也许等他们讲了历史过后，他就会讲述他自己的历史。","It was the colonists’ history which he thus demanded, and for the first time.Perhaps this history recounted, he would tell his own."
"哈丁用几句话讲述了自从离开里士满后发生的事情：他们是怎样设法生存的，以及他们现在手头拥有的资源。","In a few words Harding related all that had happened since their departure from Richmond; how they had managed, and what resources they now had at their disposal."
"陌生人聚精会神地听着。","The stranger listened with extreme attention."
"接下来，工程师向他介绍了他们是谁——吉丁·史佩莱、赫伯特、潘克洛夫、纳布和他自己。他又接着讲了他们来到林肯岛后，感到最快乐的事情就是，乘着船从达抱岛归来，并且他们能有一个新伙伴。","Then the engineer told who they all were, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Pencroft, Neb, himself, and, he added, that the greatest happiness they had felt since their arrival in Lincoln Island was on the return of the vessel from Tabor Island, when they had been able to include among them a new companion."
"听到这些话后，陌生人的脸变红了，头低到了胸膛，从他的面部表情可以看出他很困惑。","At these words the stranger’s face flushed, his head sunk on his breast, and confusion was depicted on his countenance."
"“现在你知道我们是什么人了，”赛勒斯·哈丁接着说，“我们可以握手了吗？”","“And now that you know us,” added Cyrus Harding, “will you give us your hand?”"
"“不，”陌生人用沙哑的声音说，“不！你们是诚实的人！而我——”","“No,” replied the, stranger in a hoarse voice; “no!You are honest men!And I—” "
"第十七章","Chapter 17"
"陌生人说的最后一句话证实了开拓者的猜测。也许在大家看来，有些痛苦的过去可以弥补，但是，他的良心并没有宽恕自己。不管怎样，这个内疚的人感到懊悔，他后悔了，他的新朋友本想诚恳地和他们寻找的那只手相握，可是，他却觉得自己不配跟这些诚实的人握手！不过，离开和美洲豹搏斗的场地后，他没有回到森林，从那天起，他也没有走出花岗石宫的范围。","These last words justified the colonists’ presentiment.There had been some mournful past, perhaps expiated in the sight of men, but from which his conscience had not yet absolved him.At any rate the guilty man felt remorse, he repented, and his new friends would have cordially pressed the hand which they sought; but he did not feel himself worthy to extend it to honest men!However, after the scene with the jaguar, he did not return to the forest, and from that day did not go beyond the enclosure of Granite House."
"他生命中到底有什么秘密呢？陌生人是否会在某一天说出来？只有时间能够证明了。无论如何，他们一致同意不应再问他这个秘密，他们要显得毫无疑虑的样子和他生活在一起。","What was the mystery of his life?Would the stranger one day speak of it?Time alone could show.At any rate, it was agreed that his secret should never be asked from him, and that they would live with him as if they suspected nothing."
"有一些日子，他们的生活照旧继续。赛勒斯·哈丁和吉丁·史佩莱共同工作，有时候是当化学家，有时候是做实验家。记者除了和赫伯特一起打猎外，从来没有离开过工程师，因为让小男孩一个人在树林里漫步是很不明智的，警戒是非常有必要的。纳布和潘克洛夫有时候在马房和家禽饲养场，有时在畜栏，不算上花岗石宫的工作，他们从来都不会没有活干。","For some days their life continued as before.Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett worked together, sometimes chemists, sometimes experimentalists.The reporter never left the engineer except to hunt with Herbert, for it would not have been prudent to allow the lad to ramble alone in the forest; and it was very necessary to be on their guard.As to Neb and Pencroft, one day at the stables and poultry-yard, another at the corral, without reckoning work in Granite House, they were never in want of employment."
"陌生人一个人忙着，他又恢复了以前的生活：进餐时间从不出现，睡在高地的树下，从不与同伴交往。看来，他真的不能忍受那些救过他的人所生活的社会！","The stranger worked alone, and he had resumed his usual life, never appearing at meals, sleeping under the trees in the plateau, never mingling with his companions.It really seemed as if the society of those who had saved him was insupportable to him!"
"“可是，”潘克洛夫说，“为什么他要人类同胞去救他呢？他为什么将纸条扔进大海呢？”","“But then,” observed Pencroft, “why did he entreat the help of his fellow-creatures?Why did he throw that paper into the sea?”"
"“他会告诉我们原因的。”赛勒斯·哈丁总是那样回答。","“He will tell us why,” invariably replied Cyrus Harding."
"“那会是什么时候？”","“When?”"
"“也许比你想的要早，潘克洛夫。”","“Perhaps sooner than you think, Pencroft.”"
"果然，他要坦白的日子已经不远了。","And, indeed, the day of confession was near."
"12月10日，也就是他回到花岗石宫一星期后，哈丁看见陌生人向他走来，用平静而又谦卑的声音说：“先生，我有事求你。”","On the 10th of December, a week after his return to Granite House, Harding saw the stranger approaching, who, in a calm voice and humble tone, said to him: “Sir, I have a request to make of you.”"
"“说吧，”工程师回答说，“但是，首先我要问你一个问题。”","“Speak,” answered the engineer, “but first let me ask you a question.”"
"听到这话后，陌生人变得满脸通红，他想要后退。赛勒斯·哈丁明白这个内疚的人脑子里正在想什么，他肯定是在担心工程师会问他的过去。","At these words the stranger reddened, and was on the point of withdrawing.Cyrus Harding understood what was passing in the mind of the guilty man, who doubtless feared that the engineer would interrogate him on his past life."
"哈丁拖住了他。","Harding held him back."
"“朋友，”他说，“我们不仅是你的同伴，而且还是你的朋友。我希望你相信这一点，现在该我听你说了。”","“Comrade,” said he, “we are not only your companions but your friends.I wish you to believe that, and now I will listen to you.”"
"陌生人用手捂住了双眼。他突然哆嗦起来，有那么几分钟，说不出一个字。","The stranger pressed his hand over his eyes.He was seized with a sort of trembling, and remained a few moments without being able to articulate a word."
"“先生，”他最后说，“我过来是想求你帮我个忙。”","“Sir,” said he at last, “I have come to beg you to grant me a favor.”"
"“什么事？”","“What is it?”"
"“离这里四五英里的地方，你们有一个养家畜的畜栏。这些动物需要有人照顾。你能不能让我和它们住在一起啊？”","“You have, four or five miles from here, a corral for your domesticated animals.These animals need to be taken care of.Will you allow me to live there with them?”"
"赛勒斯·哈丁十分同情地注视着这个不幸的人，片刻过后，才说：","Cyrus Harding gazed at the unfortunate man for a few moments with a feeling of deep commiseration; then,—"
"“我的朋友，那个畜栏只能勉强适合住牲口。”","“My friend,” said he, “the corral has only stables hardly fit for animals.”"
"“对我来说已经很好了，先生。”","“It will be good enough for me, sir.”"
"“我的朋友，”哈丁回答，“我们不会限制你做任何事情。你想要住在畜栏，那就去吧。不过，我们随时欢迎你来花岗石宫。但是你想住在畜栏，那么我们就做一下必要的整理，让你在那儿住得舒舒服服的。”","“My friend,” answered Harding, “we will not constrain you in anything.You wish to live at the corral, so be it.You will, however, be always welcome at Granite House.But since you wish to live at the corral we will make the necessary arrangements for your being comfortably established there.”"
"“不要在意，我自己会安排得很好的。”","“Never mind that, I shall do very well.”"
"“我的朋友，”哈丁回答，他总是故意用这个诚挚的称呼，“关于这件事怎么做最好，你必须让我们决定。”","“My friend,” answered Harding, who always intentionally made use of this cordial appellation, “you must let us judge what it will be best to do in this respect.”"
"“谢谢您，先生。”陌生人边说边后退。","“Thank you, sir,” replied the stranger as he withdrew."
"工程师接着就将陌生人向他提出的要求告诉了同伴，他们一致同意在畜栏里建一个木屋，将里面布置得尽可能舒服些。","The engineer then made known to his companions the proposal which had been made to him, and it was agreed that they should build a wooden house at the corral, which they would make as comfortable as possible."
"也就是那一天，开拓者们准备了必要的工具对畜栏进行修补，不到一周，这个房子就只等房客入住了。这所房屋建在离棚屋约20英尺的地方，从里面很容易看到羊群，羊的数目已经超过80了。他们制作了一些家具：一张床，一张桌子，一条长凳，一只碗橱和柜子；他们还带去一支枪、一些弹药和工具。","That very day the colonists repaired to the corral with the necessary tools, and a week had not passed before the house was ready to receive its tenant.It was built about twenty feet from the sheds, and from there it was easy to overlook the flock of sheep, which then numbered more than eighty.Some furniture, a bed, table, bench, cupboard, and chest were manufactured, and a gun, ammunition, and tools were carried to the corral."
"可是，陌生人还没有看到他的新住所的一切，他让居民们在那里工作的时候不用管自己，而他自己在高地上忙着，肯定是想自己完成最后的工作。事实上，由于他的劳动成果，整个地面都翻了一遍，时机一到，就可以耕种了。","The stranger, however, had seen nothing of his new dwelling, and he had allowed the settlers to work there without him, while he occupied himself on the plateau, wishing, doubtless, to put the finishing stroke to his work.Indeed, thanks to him, all the ground was dug up and ready to he sowed when the time came."
"畜栏的所有布置工作在12月20日全部完成。工程师通知陌生人，他的住所准备好迎接他入住了，陌生人回答说他当天晚上就去住。","It was on the 20th of December that all the arrangements at the corral were completed.The engineer announced to the stranger that his dwelling was ready to receive him, and the latter replied that he would go and sleep there that very evening."
"当天晚上，开拓者们聚集在花岗石宫的餐厅里。八点的时候，他们的同伴要离开了。他们不想因为他们的存在而麻烦他，强迫说再见的必要性，可能会让他感到难受，因此，他们把陌生人一个人留在那里，上到了花岗石宫。","On this evening the colonists were gathered in the diningroom of Granite House.It was then eight o’clock, the hour at which their companion was to leave them.Not wishing to trouble him by their presence, and thus imposing on him the necessity of saying farewells which might perhaps be painful to him, they had left him alone and ascended to Granite House."
"此刻，他们在房间里谈了几分钟，就听到门口有轻轻的敲门声。几乎是同时，陌生人走了进来，没有任何开场白：","Now, they had been talking in the room for a few minutes, when a light knock was heard at the door.Almost immediately the stranger entered, and without any preamble,—"
"“先生们，”他说，“在我离开你们之前，告诉你们我的故事是应该的。我告诉你们吧。”","“Gentlemen,” said he, “before I leave you, it is right that you should know my history.I will tell it you.”"
"这些简单的话语深深感动了赛勒斯·哈丁和他的同伴们。工程师站了起来。","These simple words profoundly impressed Cyrus Harding and his companions.The engineer rose."
"“我们没有要求什么，我的朋友，”他说，“你可以保持沉默。”","“We ask you nothing, my friend,” said he; “it is your right to be silent.”"
"“说出来是我的职责。”","“It is my duty to speak.”"
"“那就坐下来说吧。”","“Sit down, then.”"
"“不用，我站着。”","“No, I will stand.”"
"“我们准备听你说了。”哈丁回答。","“We are ready to hear you,” replied Harding."
"陌生人就站在房间的一个角落，那里比较阴暗。他光着头，双臂合着，交叉在胸前，他就以这样一种姿势，用沙哑的声音说的，说起话来就像有人强迫他说似的，听话的人并没有马上打断他，他说了下面这些话：","The stranger remained standing in a corner of the room, a little in the shade.He was bareheaded, his arms folded across his chest, and it was in this posture that in a hoarse voice, speaking like some one who obliges himself to speak, he gave the following recital, which his auditors did not once interrupt:—"
"“1854年12月20日，一条蒸汽游艇停靠在了 澳大利亚西海岸的百奴衣角，那里的纬度是37度，这游艇属于一个苏格兰贵族格里那凡爵士。这艘游艇上有格里那凡爵士和他的妻子，一个英国陆军少校，一个法国地理学家，一个年轻的女孩和一个年轻的男孩。最后那两个是格兰特船长的孩子，一年前，他的‘大不列颠’号连同船上的货物和船员都失踪了。‘邓肯’由约翰·孟格尓船长指挥，上面配备了15个水手。","“On the 20th of December, 1854, a steam-yacht, belonging to a Scotch nobleman, Lord Glenarvan, anchored off Cape Bernouilli, on the western coast of Australia, in the thirty-seventh parallel.On board this yacht were Lord Glenarvan and his wife, a major in the English army, a French geographer, a young girl, and a young boy.These two last were the children of Captain Grant, whose ship, the ‘Britannia,’ had been lost, crew and cargo, a year before.The ‘Duncan’ was commanded by Captain John Mangles, and manned by a crew of fifteen men."
"“游艇那时在澳大利亚海岸停下来，原因是这样的：六个月前，‘邓肯’号上的人在爱尔兰海上捡到一个瓶子，里面有一张纸条，纸上写着英文、德文和法文。这张纸条大意是说，‘大不列颠’号失事后，仍有三个人幸存下来，他们是格兰特船长和两个水手，这三个人在某个岛上找到避难所，纸条上注明着海岛的纬度，可是写着经度的地方被海水侵蚀了，已经认不出来了。","“This is the reason the yacht at this time lay off the coast of Australia.Six months before, a bottle, enclosing a document written in English, German, and French, had been found in the Irish Sea, and picked up by the ‘Duncan.’ This document stated in substance that there still existed three survivors from the wreck of the ‘Britannia,’ that these survivors were Captain Grant and two of his men, and that they had found refuge on some land, of which the document gave the latitude, but of which the longitude, effaced by the sea, was no longer legible."
"“这个纬度是南纬37度11分，经度不知，因此，如果他们顺着大陆和大海上方的37度寻找，他们就一定会到达格兰特船长和他的两个同伴所在的地点。英国海军部对于搜寻工作犹豫不决，格里那凡爵士下定决心要想尽一切办法找回船长。他联系了玛丽和罗伯特·格兰特，这两个孩子也加入了他的队伍。‘邓肯’号游艇是为远航而装备的，贵族的家人和船长的孩子也想加入。‘邓肯’号从格拉斯哥出发，驶向大西洋，途中经过麦哲伦海峡，穿过太平洋，远至巴塔戈尼亚。根据纸条之前的解释，他们认为格兰特船长被印第安人掳去了。","“This latitude was 37deg 11’ south; therefore, the longitude being unknown, if they followed the thirty-seventh parallel over continents and seas, they would be certain to reach the spot inhabited by Captain Grant and his two companions.The English Admiralty having hesitated to undertake this search, Lord Glenarvan resolved to attempt everything to find the captain.He communicated with Mary and Robert Grant, who joined him.The ‘Duncan’ yacht was equipped for the distant voyage, in which the nobleman’s family and the captain’s children wished to take part, and the ‘Duncan,’ leaving Glasgow, proceeded towards the Atlantic, passed through the Straits of Magellan, and ascended the Pacific as far as Patagonia, where, according to a previous interpretation of the document, they supposed that Captain Grant was a prisoner among the Indians."
"“‘邓肯’号让乘客在巴塔戈尼亚的西海岸登陆，再将船开到科连特斯角的东岸接他们。格里那凡爵士沿着37度纬线穿过了巴塔戈尼亚，但是却没有发现船长的踪迹。12月13日，他再次上船，为了继续在海洋上寻找。","“The ‘Duncan’ disembarked her passengers on the western coast of Patagonia, and sailed to pick them up again on the eastern coast at Cape Corrientes.Lord Glenarvan traversed Patagonia, following the thirty-seventh parallel, and having found no trace of the captain, he re-embarked on the 13th of November, so as to pursue his search through the Ocean."
"“在特里斯特德阿丘纳和阿姆斯特丹岛毫无收获后，就像我说过的，‘邓肯’就位于航线上，并于1854年12月20日到达澳大利亚西海岸上的百奴衣角。","“After having unsuccessfully visited the islands of Tristan d’Acunha and Amsterdam, situated in her course, the ‘Duncan,’ as I have said, arrived at Cape Bernouilli, on the Australian coast, on the 20th of December, 1854."
"“格里那凡爵士想要像横越美洲一样穿越澳大利亚，于是，他在那里登陆了。距离海岸几英里的地方建了一个农场，这个农场属于一个爱尔兰人，他对旅行者很热情。格里那凡爵士告诉了这个爱尔兰人他到这些地方的原因，还问他是否知道叫‘大不列颠’的英国三桅船，不到两年前，它在澳大利亚西海岸一带失踪。","“It was Lord Glenarvan’s intention to traverse Australia as he had traversed America, and he disembarked.A few miles from the coast was established a farm, belonging to an Irishman, who offered hospitality to the travelers.Lord Glenarvan made known to the Irishman the cause which had brought him to these parts, and asked if he knew whether a three-masted English vessel, the ‘Britannia,’ had been lost less than two years before on the west coast of Australia."
"“爱尔兰人从未听说过有船失事，不过令旁观者非常吃惊的是，他的一个仆人走上前说：","“The Irishman had never heard of this wreck, but, to the great surprise of the bystanders, one of his servants came forward and said,—"
"“‘阁下，谢天谢地！如果船长格兰特还活着，他现在一定还在澳大利亚的海岸上。’","“‘My lord, praise and thank God!If Captain Grant is still living, he is living on the Australian shores.’"
"“‘你是谁？’格里那凡爵士问。","“‘Who are you?’ asked Lord Glenarvan."
"“‘和您一样，是苏格兰人，阁下，’那个人说，‘我是格兰特船长手下的一个水手——大不列颠的落难者之一。’","“‘A Scotchman like yourself, my lord,’ replied the man; ‘I am one of Captain Grant’s crew—one of the castaways of the “Britannia.”’"
"“这个人叫艾尔顿。就像他的纸条上写的那样，事实上，他是‘大不列颠’船上的副水手长。不过，他在船触礁的时候就和格兰特船长分开了，他一直认为船长和所有的水手都丧生了，而他——艾尔顿，是‘大不列颠’上唯一的幸存者。","“This man was called Ayrton.He was, in fact, the boatswain’s mate of the ‘Britannia,’ as his papers showed.But, separated from Captain Grant at the moment when the ship struck upon the rocks, he had till then believed that the captain with all his crew had perished, and that he, Ayrton, was the sole survivor of the ‘Britannia.’"
"“‘只是，’他接着说，‘船失踪的地方不是在西海岸，而是在澳大利亚的东岸。如果格兰特船长还活着，就像纸条上说的那样，他被当地人囚禁了，我们应该到东海岸上去寻找。’","“‘Only,’ he added, ‘it was not on the west coast, but on the east coast of Australia that the vessel was lost, and if Captain Grant is still living, as his document indicates, he is a prisoner among the natives, and it is on the other coast that he must be looked for.’"
"“这个人说起话来很坦诚，也很自信，他的话不用怀疑。他已经服侍这个爱尔兰人一年多了，这也证明了他的忠实可靠。因此，格里那凡爵士相信这个人是忠诚的，根据他的建议，他决定顺着南纬37度，跨越澳大利亚。格里那凡爵士、他的妻子、两个孩子、陆军少校、法国地理学家、孟格尓船长和几个水手组成了一个小团队，由艾尔顿指挥。‘邓肯’号在汤姆·奥斯汀大副的控制下，驶向了墨尔本，在那里等候格里那凡爵士的安排。","“This man spoke in a frank voice and with a confident look; his words could not be doubted.The irishman, in whose service he had been for more than a year, answered for his trustworthiness.Lord Glenarvan, therefore, believed in the fidelity of this man and, by his advice, resolved to cross Australia, following the thirty-seventh parallel.Lord Glenarvan, his wife, the two children, the major, the Frenchman, Captain Mangles, and a few sailors composed the little band under the command of Ayrton, while the ‘Duncan,’ under charge of the mate, Tom Austin, proceeded to Melbourne, there to await Lord Glenarvan’s instructions."
"“他们在 1854年12月23日启程。","“They set out on the 23rd of December, 1854."
"“我看是时候说艾尔顿是个叛徒了。实际上，他是‘大不列颠’上的副水手长，不过，后来与船长有了争议，于是他就想煽动船员叛变，并将船占为己有。1852年4月8日，格兰特船长让他在澳大利亚西海岸下了船，将他丢在那里，然后起航了，按照海上的规矩，这样做是正确的。","“It is time to say that Ayrton was a traitor.He was, indeed, the boatswain’s mate of the ‘Britannia,’ but, after some dispute with his captain, he endeavored to incite the crew to mutiny and seize the ship, and Captain Grant had landed him, on the 8th of April, 1852, on the west coast of Australia, and then sailed, leaving him there, as was only just."
"“所以，这个卑鄙的的人对‘大不列颠’号遇难的事情一无所知，他只是从格里那凡的描述中听来的。自从被抛弃后，他就以本·乔伊斯的名义成为了一群逃犯的头子。他胆敢坚持船失事的地方是在东海岸，目的是将格里那凡爵士带往那个方向，希望将他和船分开，得到‘邓肯’号，并将游艇作为太平洋上的海盗船。","“Therefore this wretched man knew nothing of the wreck of the ‘Britannia’; he had just heard of it from Glenarvan’s account.Since his abandonment, he had become, under the name of Ben Joyce, the leader of the escaped convicts; and if he boldly maintained that the wreck had taken place on the east coast, and led Lord Glenarvan to proceed in that direction, it was that he hoped to separate him from his ship, seize the ‘Duncan,’ and make the yacht a pirate in the Pacific.”"
"说到这里，陌生人停了一会儿。他声音有些颤抖，但是他接着说：","Here the stranger stopped for a moment.His voice trembled, but he continued,—"
"“远征开始了，并穿过了澳大利亚。他们非倒霉不可，因为艾尔顿，也就是本·乔伊斯，可以这样称呼他，给他们做向导。而那群囚犯有时在船的前面，有时跟在船的后面，他告诉他们必须怎么做。","“The expedition set out and proceeded across Australia.It was inevitably unfortunate, since Ayrton, or Ben Joyce, as he may be called, guided it, sometimes preceded, sometimes followed by his band of convicts, who had been told what they had to do."
"“这期间，‘邓肯’号已经被送往墨尔本维修去了。接下来必须要做的就是让格里那凡爵士命令游船离开墨尔本，到澳大利亚东岸，在那里很容易得到这艘船。船快要靠岸的时候，艾尔顿在没有其他资源的广阔树林里找到一封信，上面要求他将这封信带给‘邓肯’号上的大副，信上命令这艘游艇马上到东岸进行维修，再到吐福湾，也就是说，在远征停止的地方开始几天的航程。在那里，艾尔顿同意见他的帮凶，拿到这封信两天后，就到达了墨尔本。","“Meanwhile, the ‘Duncan’ had been sent to Melbourne for repairs.It was necessary, then, to get Lord Glenarvan to order her to leave Melbourne and go to the east coast of Australia, where it would be easy to seize her.After having led the expedition near enough to the coast, in the midst of vast forests with no resources, Ayrton obtained a letter, which he was charged to carry to the mate of the ‘Duncan’—a letter which ordered the yacht to repair immediately to the east coast, to Twofold Bay, that is to say a few days’ journey from the place where the expedition had stopped.It was there that Ayrton had agreed to meet his accomplices, and two days after gaining possession of the letter, he arrived at Melbourne."
"“到目前为止，这个恶棍邪恶的计划一直是成功的。他可以将‘邓肯’号带到吐福湾，在那里，逃犯们很容易就能获得这船。把上面的船员都杀掉后，本·乔伊斯就会成为这片海域上的主人。不过，感谢上帝阻止了这些可怕的计划的实现。","“So far the villain had succeeded in his wicked design.He would be able to take the ‘Duncan’ into Twofold Bay, where it would be easy for the convicts to seize her, and her crew massacred, Ben Joyce would become master of the seas.But it pleased God to prevent the accomplishment of these terrible projects."
"“艾尔顿到达墨尔本后，将信交给大副汤姆·奥斯汀，他看完信后马上起航，可是令艾尔顿愤怒和失望的是，第二天他发现大副没有乘着船去澳大利亚的东海岸——吐福湾，而是去了新西兰的东岸。他想要阻止他，但是奥斯汀让他看了一下信！事实上，由于法国地理学家神助的错误，上面提到的新西兰东岸才是目的地。","“Ayrton, arrived at Melbourne, delivered the letter to the mate, Tom Austin, who read it and immediately set sail, but judge of Ayrton’s rage and disappointment, when the next day he found that the mate was taking the vessel, not to the east coast of Australia, to Twofold Bay, but to the east coast of New Zealand.He wished to stop him, but Austin showed him the letter!...And indeed, by a providential error of the French geographer, who had written the letter, the east coast of New Zealand was mentioned as the place of destination."
"“艾尔顿所有的计划都变成了泡影！他变得狂怒起来。他们给他戴上了铁铐。他们又把他带到了新西兰海岸，他不知道他的同犯的结果会怎样，也不知道格里那凡爵士的结果会怎样。","“All Ayrton’s plans were frustrated!He became outrageous.They put him in irons.He was then taken to the coast of New Zealand, not knowing what would become of his accomplices, or what would become of Lord Glenarvan."
"“‘邓肯’号在海岸边一直行驶着，直到3月3日。当天，艾尔顿就听到了炮声。原来是‘邓肯’号开的炮，很快格里那凡爵士和同伴们又回到了船上。","“The ‘Duncan’ cruised about on this coast until the 3rd of March.On that day Ayrton heard the report of guns.The guns on the ‘Duncan’ were being fired, and soon Lord Glenarvan and his companions came on board."
"“这就是事情的经过。","“This is what had happened."
"“经历了千难万险后，格里那凡爵士终于完成了旅程，到达了澳大利亚东海岸的吐福湾。他给墨尔本打了个电报，说‘邓肯’号不在此地！回电说：‘邓肯号18号立即起航。目的地不详。’","“After a thousand hardships, a thousand dangers, Lord Glenarvan had accomplished his journey, and arrived on the east coast of Australia, at Twofold Bay.‘Not “Duncan!”’ He telegraphed to Melbourne.They answered, ‘“Duncan” sailed on the 18th instant.Destination unknown.’"
"“格里那凡爵士只有一个结果，这艘真正的游艇已经落入了本·乔伊斯的手中，并且成了一只海盗船！","“Lord Glenarvan could only arrive at one conclusion; that his honest yacht had fallen into the hands of Ben Joyce, and had become a pirate vessel!"
"“但是，格里那凡爵士不会放弃。他很勇敢，而且很慷慨。他登上一艘商船，驶向新西兰西海岸，沿着37度纬线行驶，却没有发现格兰特船长的任何踪迹。不过，让他吃惊的是，可能是神的旨意，他竟然在东岸找到了‘邓肯’号，由大副掌控，他已经在那儿等了他五个星期了！","“However, Lord Glenarvan would not give up.He was a bold and generous man.He embarked in a merchant vessel, sailed to the west coast of New Zealand, traversed it along the thirty-seventh parallel, without finding any trace of Captain Grant; but on the other side, to his great surprise, and by the will of Heaven, he found the ‘Duncan,’ under command of the mate, who had been waiting for him for five weeks!"
"“这天是1855年3月3日。格里那凡爵士现在就在船上，但艾尔顿也在上面。他站在贵族的面前，想要从这个恶棍嘴中得到他所知道的格兰特船长的一切情况。艾尔顿拒绝说话。格里那凡爵士又告诉他，进入第一个港口后，他就会将他交给英国当局。艾尔顿还是保持沉默。","“This was on the 3rd of March, 1855.Lord Glenarvan was now on board the ‘Duncan,’ but Ayrton was there also.He appeared before the nobleman, who wished to extract from him all that the villain knew about Captain Grant.Ayrton refused to speak.Lord Glenarvan then told him, that at the first port they put into, he would be delivered up to the English authorities.Ayrton remained mute."
"“‘邓肯’号继续沿着南纬37度行驶。同时，格里那凡夫人承担了击退恶棍的抵抗的任务。","“The ‘Duncan’ continued her voyage along the thirty-seventh parallel.In the meanwhile, Lady Glenarvan undertook to vanquish the resistance of the ruffian."
"“最后，她的影响起作用了，不过，艾尔顿向她提出了交代实情的交换条件，就是格里那凡爵士可以把他留在太平洋的某个岛上，而不能把他交给英国当局。格里那凡爵士决定不惜任何代价获得船长的信息，于是就同意了。","“At last, her influence prevailed, and Ayrton, in exchange for what he could tell, proposed that Lord Glenarvan should leave him on some island in the Pacific, instead of giving him up to the English authorities.Lord Glenarvan, resolving to do anything to obtain information about Captain Grant, consented."
"“于是艾尔顿就讲述了他的所有生活，可以确定的是，自从格兰特船长将他留在澳大利亚海岸上的那一天起，他就什么也不知道了。","“Ayrton then related all his life, and it was certain that he knew nothing from the day on which Captain Grant had landed him on the Australian coast."
"“不过，格里那凡爵士信守了他给出的承诺。‘邓肯’号继续航行，之后到达了达抱岛。那也就是艾尔顿登陆的地方，也就是在那个地方，他们找到了格兰特船长和另外两个水手，正好是在南纬37度上，这真是个奇迹。","“Nevertheless, Lord Glenarvan kept the promise which he had given.The ‘Duncan’ continued her voyage and arrived at Tabor Island.It was there that Ayrton was to be landed, and it was there also that, by a veritable miracle, they found Captain Grant and two men, exactly on the thirty-seventh parallel."
"“于是，这个囚犯就取代了他们在这个遗弃的小岛上的位置，当他离开游船的时候，格里那凡爵士说：","“The convict, then, went to take their place on this desert islet, and at the moment he left the yacht these words were pronounced by Lord Glenarvan:—"
"“在这里，艾尔顿，你将远离所有的陆地，也不可能和人类联系。‘邓肯’号将你丢在这个小岛上，你是不可能逃出的。你将独自在这里，在上帝的眼睛之下，他会看到你的内心深处，但是你不会失踪，也不会被忘记，就像格兰特船长一样。你不值得被人们记住，然而人们会记得你的。我知道你在哪里，艾尔顿，我也知道到哪里找到你。我永远不会忘记这件事的！","“Here, Ayrton, you will be far from any land, and without any possible communication with your fellow-creatures.You can-not escape from this islet on which the ‘Duncan’ leaves you.You will be alone, under the eye of a God who reads the depths of the heart, but you will be neither lost nor forgotten, as was Captain Grant.Unworthy as you are to be remembered by men, men will remember you.I know where you are Ayrton, and I know where to find you.I will never forget it!"
"“‘邓肯’号扬起帆，很快就消失了。时间是1855年3月18日。","“And the ‘Duncan,’ making sail, soon disappeared.This was 18th of March, 1855."
"（我简要讲述的故事出自《格兰特船长的孩子们》，这本著作肯定有些读者读过。他们会注意到我讲述的某些日期与书中不符，不过，以后他们会明白我为什么不在一开始就说出真正的日期。）","(The events which have just been briefly related are taken from a work which some of our readers have no doubt read, and which is entitled, “Captain Grant’s children.”They will remark on this occasion, as well as later, some discrepancy in the dates; but later again, they will understand why the real dates were not at first given.)"
"“艾尔顿是独自一人，但是他不缺少弹药、武器、工具和种子。","“Ayrton was alone, but he had no want of either ammunition, weapons, tools, or seeds."
"“囚犯拥有的这个房子，是老实的格兰特船长建造的。他只能生活在孤独中，来赎清他所犯下的罪行。","“At his, the convict’s disposal, was the house built by honest Captain Grant.He had only to live and expiate in solitude the crimes which he had committed."
"“绅士们，他忏悔了，他为自己犯下的罪恶感到羞愧，也很痛苦！他对自己说，如果某天有人将他从这个小岛带走，他也必须配得上和他们一同返回！这个可怜的人经受了怎样的痛苦啊！他是怎样通过努力工作来稳定情绪的！他是怎么通过祈祷来改造自己的！两年、三年就这样继续着，但是，艾尔顿因孤独而自卑，他经常期待着有船只出现在地平线上，并问自己赎罪的时间是否很快就结束了，他承受了别人没有承受过的痛苦！啊！对于一颗被悔恨苦苦折磨的心来说，这种孤独是多么可怕！","“Gentlemen, he repented, he was ashamed of his crimes and was very miserable!He said to himself, that if men came some day to take him from that islet, he must be worthy to return among them!How he suffered, that wretched man!How he labored to recover himself by work!How he prayed to be reformed by prayer!For two years, three years, this went on, but Ayrton, humbled by solitude, always looking for some ship to appear on the horizon, asking himself if the time of expiation would soon be complete, suffered as none other suffered!Oh! how dreadful was this solitude, to a heart tormented by remorse!"
"“不过，毫无疑问的是，老天对这个不幸的人的惩罚还不够，因为他感觉到自己渐渐变成了一个野人！他感觉到自己慢慢地养成了野性！","“But doubtless Heaven had not sufficiently punished this unhappy man, for he felt that he was gradually becoming a savage!He felt that brutishness was gradually gaining on him!"
"“他说不出是否是两三年的孤独让他变成这样的，不过，他最后还是变成了你找到的这个可怜家伙！","“He could not say if it was after two or three years of solitude, but at last he became the miserable creature you found!"
"“我不说你们也知道了，绅士们，我就是本·乔伊斯。”","“I have no need to tell you, gentlemen, that Ayrton, Ben Joyce, and I, are the same.”"
"赛勒斯·哈丁和同伴在他讲完后站了起来。他们受感动的程度无法用语言形容！展现在他们面前的是多么大的痛苦、忧伤和绝望啊！","Cyrus Harding and his companions rose at the end of this account.It is impossible to say how much they were moved!What misery, grief, and despair lay revealed before them!"
"“艾尔顿，”哈丁站起来说，“你曾经是个罪孽深重的人，可是老天肯定认为你已经赎罪了！你被再次带到人类同胞中间，就证明了这一点。艾尔顿，你已经得到了宽恕！现在，你愿意成为我们的同伴吗？”","“Ayrton,” said Harding, rising, “you have been a great criminal, but Heaven must certainly think that you have expiated your crimes!That has been proved by your having been brought again among your fellow-creatures.Ayrton, you are forgiven!And now you will be our companion?”"
"艾尔顿后退了几步。","Ayrton drew back."
"“让我们握握手吧！”工程师说。","“Here is my hand!” said the engineer."
"艾尔顿抓住哈丁伸向他的手，眼泪夺眶而出。","Ayrton grasped the hand which Harding extended to him, and great tears fell from his eyes."
"“你愿意和我们住一起吗？”赛勒斯·哈丁问。","“Will you live with us?” asked Cyrus Harding."
"“哈丁船长，让我再独处一段时间吧，”艾尔顿回答，“让我独自住在畜栏的小屋里吧！”","“Captain Harding, leave me some time longer,” replied Ayrton, “leave me alone in the hut in the corral!”"
"“随你便，艾尔顿。”赛勒斯·哈丁回答。艾尔顿正要离开，工程师又问了他一个问题：","“As you like, Ayrton,” answered Cyrus Harding.Ayrton was going to withdraw, when the engineer addressed one more question to him:—"
"“还有一句话，我的朋友。既然你想一个人住这里，那为什么你又将纸条扔进大海，让我们按照你的踪迹寻找呢？”","“One word more, my friend.Since it was your intention to live alone, why did you throw into the sea the document which put us on your track?”"
"“纸条？”艾尔顿重复说，他似乎不知道哈丁说的意思。","“A document?” repeated Ayrton, who did not appear to know what he meant."
"“是的，我们找到一张封在瓶里的纸条，上面写着达抱岛的精确位置！”","“Yes, the document which we found enclosed in a bottle, giving us the exact position of Tabor Island!”"
"艾尔顿将手放在额头上想了一会儿，然后说；“我从来没有把什么纸条扔进大海里！”他回答。","Ayrton passed his hand over his brow, then after having thought, “I never threw any document into the sea!” he answered."
"“从来没有？”潘克洛夫喊道。","“Never?” exclaimed Pencroft."
"“从来没有！”","“Never!”"
"艾尔顿鞠了一躬，走到门口，然后离开了。","And Ayrton, bowing, reached the door and departed."
"第十八章","Chapter 18"
"赫伯特冲到门口，看见艾尔顿拉动升降机的绳子，消失在黑暗中，他回到屋里，叫了一声：“可怜的人！”","“Poor man!” said Herbert, who had rushed to the door, but returned, having seen Ayrton slide down the rope on the lift and disappear in the darkness."
"“他会回来的。”赛勒斯·哈丁说。","“He will come back,” said Cyrus Harding."
"“现在过来，上尉，”潘克洛夫喊道，“这是怎么回事呢？怎么！难道不是艾尔顿把瓶子丢进大海的吗？那究竟是谁干的呢？”","“Come, now, captain,” exclaimed Pencroft, “what does that mean?What! wasn’t it Ayrton who threw that bottle into the sea?Who was it then?”"
"不错，如果必须提个问题，那就是这一个。","Certainly, if ever a question was necessary to be made, it was that one!"
"“是他扔的，”纳布答道，“只是这个不幸的人当时处在半疯状态。”","“It was he,” answered Neb, “only the unhappy man was half-mad.”"
"“是的！”赫伯特说，“他已经意识不到自己都干过些什么了。”","“Yes!” said Herbert, “and he was no longer conscious of what he was doing.”"
"“这个问题只能这样解释，朋友们，”哈丁立刻回答说，“现在我才明白艾尔顿怎么能够准确地指出达抱岛的位置，原来在他被留在岛上之前发生的事情使他知道这一切。”","“It can only be explained in that way, my friends,” replied Harding quickly, “and I understand now how Ayrton was able to point out exactly the situation of Tabor Island, since the events which had preceded his being left on the island had made it known to him.”"
"“但是，”潘克洛夫指出，“如果他写纸条时还没有变成野蛮人，又如果纸条是他在七八年前扔进大海的，那它怎么会没因潮湿而损坏呢？”","“However,” observed Pencroft, “if he was not yet a brute when he wrote that document, and if he threw it into the sea seven or eight years ago, how is it that the paper has not been injured by damp?”"
"“这表明，”赛勒斯·史哈丁答道，“艾尔顿只是最近才丧失理智的，可他自己却认为很早就这样了。”","“That proves,” answered Cyrus Harding, “that Ayrton was deprived of intelligence at a more recent time than he thinks.”"
"“当然应该是这样，”潘克洛夫说，“不然事情就没法解释了。”","“Of course it must be so,” replied Pencroft, “without that the fact would be unaccountable.”"
"“确实没法解释。”工程师回答说，他似乎不想再继续谈下去了。","“Unaccountable indeed,” answered the engineer, who did not appear desirous to prolong the conversation."
"“不过，艾尔顿说了实话吗？”水手问道。","“But has Ayrton told the truth?” asked the sailor."
"“是的，”记者回答说，“他讲的故事完全是真实的。当时报纸对格里那凡爵士负责的游艇远航以及远航结果的报道，我记得很清楚。”","“Yes,” replied the reporter.“The story which he has told is true in every point.I remember quite well the account in the newspapers of the yacht expedition undertaken by Lord Glenarvan, and its result.”"
"“艾尔顿说的是实话，”哈丁补充道，“不要对此怀疑，潘克洛夫，这对他来说很痛苦。一个人能这样指责自己，说的肯定是实话！”","“Ayrton has told the truth,” added Harding.“Do not doubt it, Pencroft, for it was painful to him.People tell the truth when they accuse themselves like that!”"
"翌日，12月21日，开拓者们下到海滩，爬上高地，发现艾尔顿并不在那里。他昨天夜里才回到了畜栏的屋子里，居民们觉得最好还是不要去打扰他。同情无法做到的事，时间一定能做到。","The next day—the 21st of December—the colonists descended to the beach, and having climbed the plateau they found nothing of Ayrton.He had reached his house in the corral during the night and the settlers judged it best not to agitate him by their presence.Time would doubtless perform what sympathy had been unable to accomplish."
"于是赫伯特、潘克洛夫和纳布重新做起了他们平日的工作。这一天，由于哈丁和记者要做同样的事情，所以呆在“石窟”的工场里。","Herbert, Pencroft, and Neb resumed their ordinary occupations.On this day the same work brought Harding and the reporter to the workshop at the Chimneys."
"“你知道吗？亲爱的赛勒斯，”吉丁·史佩莱说，“昨天你所作的关于瓶子的解释，根本无法使我满意！怎么可以认为这个不幸的人写了纸条，把瓶子扔进海里，自己却一点也不记得呢？”","“Do you know, my dear Cyrus,” said Gideon Spilett, “that the explanation you gave yesterday on the subject of the bottle has not satisfied me at all!How can it be supposed that the unfortunate man was able to write that document and throw the bottle into the sea without having the slightest recollection of it?”"
"“所以也不是他把瓶子扔进海里的，亲爱的史佩莱。”","“Nor was it he who threw it in, my dear Spilett.”"
"“那么，你认为——”　　“我什么也不认为，什么也不知道！”赛勒斯·哈丁打断他说，“我只能把这件事算到那些至今还无法解释的事情中去！”","“You think then—”“I think nothing, I know nothing!” interrupted Cyrus Harding.“I am content to rank this incident among those which I have not been able to explain to this day!”"
"“说实在的，赛勒斯，”史佩莱说，“这些事情太不可思议了！你的获救，沙滩上搁浅的箱子，托普的冒险经历，最后还有这只瓶子……难道我们永远都无法得到这些谜团的答案吗？”","“Indeed, Cyrus,” said Spilett, “these things are incredible!Your rescue, the case stranded on the sand, Top’s adventure, and lastly this bottle...Shall we never have the answer to these enigmas?”"
"“不会的！”工程师很快地答道，“不会，即使要深入小岛的内部！”","“Yes!” replied the engineer quickly, “yes, even if I have to penetrate into the bowels of this island!”"
"“也许机遇会给我们提供打开这个秘密的钥匙！”","“Chance will perhaps give us the key to this mystery!”"
"“机遇！史佩莱！我不相信机遇，也不相信这世界上有什么神秘的事。这里发生的每一件不可思议的事都有原因，我一定要找出这些原因。不过同时，我们需要工作、观察。”","“Chance!Spilett!I do not believe in chance, any more than I believe in mysteries in this world.There is a reason for everything unaccountable which has happened here, and that reason I shall discover.But in the meantime we must work and observe.”"
"一月来临了。1867年也就开始了。大家继续辛勤地进行着夏季的工作。接连好几天，赫伯特和史佩莱都去畜栏劳动，确定艾尔顿已经在为他准备好的房子里住下来了。他忙着照料那些托付给他的大量畜群，这样，同伴们就不必三天两头地跑去畜栏了。不过，为了不让艾尔顿长久孤寂，居民们还是经常去看望他。","The month of January arrived.The year 1867 commenced.The summer occupations were assiduously continued.During the days which followed, Herbert and Spilett having gone in the direction of the corral, ascertained that Ayrton had taken possession of the habitation which had been prepared for him.He busied himself with the numerous flock confided to his care, and spared his companions the trouble of coming every two or three days to visit the corral.Nevertheless, in order not to leave Ayrton in solitude for too long a time, the settlers often paid him a visit."
"由于工程师和吉丁·史佩莱还心存疑虑，因此海岛的这部分地区必须有一个人监视着，这也相当重要。如果任何事情意外发生，艾尔顿都不能忽视，要通知花岗石宫里的居民们。","It was not unimportant either, in consequence of some suspicions entertained by the engineer and Gideon Spilett, that this part of the island should be subject to a surveillance of some sort, and that Ayrton, if any incident occurred unexpectedly, should not neglect to inform the inhabitants of Granite House of it."
"然而，有时会有突发事件发生，并且需要迅速报告给工程师。除了跟林肯岛上神秘事件有关的事实之外，还有许多其他情形也需要居民们立刻解决，比如发现船只经过、西海岸有船只遇难，以及可能出现的海盗登陆等。","Nevertheless it might happen that something would occur which it would be necessary to bring rapidly to the engineer’s knowledge.Independently of facts bearing on the mystery of Lincoln Island, many others might happen, which would call for the prompt interference of the colonists,—such as the sighting of a vessel, a wreck on the western coast, the possible arrival of pirates, etc."
"因此，赛勒斯·哈丁决定要让畜栏和花岗岩宫之间能时刻保持联系。","Therefore Cyrus Harding resolved to put the corral in instantaneous communication with Granite House."
"1月10号这一天，他把自己的计划告诉了伙伴们。","It was on the 10th of January that he made known his project to his companions."
"“什么！你打算怎么做呢，上尉？”潘克洛夫问道，“你不会突然想到安装一台电报机吧？”","“Why! how are you going to manage that, captain?” asked Pencroft.“Do you by chance happen to think of establishing a telegraph?”"
"“我正是这么想的。”工程师回答说。","“Exactly so,” answered the engineer."
"“用电的吗？”赫伯特大声问。","“Electric?” cried Herbert."
"“用电的，”赛勒斯·哈丁答道，“我们有制造电池所需的所有材料，最难办的就是拉伸铁丝，不过我想，用一台拉模板就可以做成。”","“Electric,” replied Cyrus Harding.“We have all the necessary materials for making a battery, and the most difficult thing will be to stretch the wires, but by means of a drawplate I think we shall manage it.”"
"“好啊，这样一来，”水手接着说，“我将绝不会对我们有一天能坐上火车失去希望！”","“Well, after that,” returned the sailor, “I shall never despair of seeing ourselves some day rolling along on a railway!”"
"于是大家开始工作，他们从最困难的事情着手，倘若不能成功，也就不必再制造电池和其他附件了。","They then set to work, beginning with the most difficult thing, for, if they failed in that, it would be useless to manufacture the battery and other accessories."
"前面已经说过，林肯岛的铁质十分优良，因而非常适合用来拉制铁丝。哈丁先制作了一个拉模板，也就是一块钢板，上面刺有大小不一的圆锥形洞孔，一个个洞可以使铁丝逐渐达到所要求的韧性。工程师打算利用瀑布作为动力，所以就在离大瀑布只有几英尺的地上埋下一个结实的架子，然后把淬过火的钢板用稳固的方法固定在架子上。事实上，缩绒机也在那里，尽管现在并没有投入使用，只要有强大的力量推动它的主轴，就可以把铁丝卷在上面，用来拉伸铁丝。这是一项细致的工作，必须非常细心。居民们事先把铁做成又长又细的铁棍，两端用锉刀锉尖，然后把铁棍插入拉模板最大的洞里，再用主轴一边卷一边拉成25到30英尺的长度，松开后，依次在较小的洞孔里重复同样的操作。最后，工程师得到了长度为40到50英尺的铁丝，把这些铁丝拴紧，就可以很容易地铺设在畜栏和花岗石宫边缘之间五英里的距离上。","The iron of Lincoln Island, as has been said, was of excellent quality, and consequently very fit for being drawn out.Harding commenced by manufacturing a drawplate, that is to say, a plate of steel, pierced with conical holes of different sizes, which would successively bring the wire to the wished-for tenacity.This piece of steel, after having been tempered, was fixed in as firm a way as possible in a solid framework planted in the ground, only a few feet from the great fall, the motive power of which the engineer intended to utilize.In fact as the fulling-mill was there, although not then in use, its beam moved with extreme power would serve to stretch out the wire by rolling it round itself.It was a delicate operation, and required much care.The iron, prepared previously in long thin rods, the ends of which were sharpened with the file, having been introduced into the largest hole of the drawplate, was drawn out by the beam which wound it round itself, to a length of twenty-five or thirty feet, then unrolled, and the same operation was performed successively through the holes of a less size.Finally, the engineer obtained wires from forty to fifty feet long, which could be easily fastened together and stretched over the distance of five miles, which separated the corral from the bounds of Granite House."
"这项工作几天就完成了，事实上，安装好了机械以后，赛勒斯·哈丁就让伙伴们去拉铁丝，而他自己则忙着去制造电池了。","It did not take more than a few days to perform this work, and indeed as soon as the machine had been commenced, Cyrus Harding left his companions to follow the trade of wiredrawers, and occupied himself with manufacturing his battery."
"在当前的情况下，需要制造一种恒流电池。大家知道，现代电池通常由炭精、锌和铜做成。工程师一点铜也没有，尽管他寻遍了林肯岛，也没能找到铜的一丝踪迹，因此只能不用它了。炭精就是煤气厂里的煤脱氢后，在蒸馏器里留下坚硬石墨，就可以得到了，不过还需要建一种特殊设备，这要花大力气。至于锌，大家可能会想起在遗物角捡到的那只箱子，箱子里面就衬着这种金属，现在派上这种用场再合适不过了。","It was necessary to obtain a battery with a constant current.It is known that the elements of modern batteries are generally composed of retort coal, zinc, and copper.Copper was absolutely wanting to the engineer, who, notwithstanding all his researches, had never been able to find any trace of it in Lincoln Island, and was therefore obliged to do without it.Retort coal, that is to say, the hard graphite which is found in the retorts of gas manufactories, after the coal has been dehydrogenized, could have been obtained, but it would have been necessary to establish a special apparatus, involving great labor.As to zinc, it may be remembered that the case found at Flotsam Point was lined with this metal, which could not be better utilized than for this purpose."
"赛勒斯·哈丁经过一番深思熟虑，决定制作一种非常简单的电池，这种只用锌作原材料的电池，与贝克雷尔在1820年发明的电池相仿。其他材料，如硝酸和钾碱，工程师手头上就有。","Cyrus Harding, after mature consideration, decided to manufacture a very simple battery, resembling as nearly as possible that invented by Becquerel in 1820, and in which zinc only is employed.The other substances, azotic acid and potash, were all at his disposal."
"这种电池是通过硝酸和钾碱相互作用而成，具体步骤如下：制作一定数量的玻璃瓶，装上硝酸。工程师用塞子堵住瓶口，一根玻璃管子穿过瓶塞通到瓶子底部，通过用布包好的黏土，玻璃管浸入硝酸里。工程师事先把各种植物烧成灰烬，提取钾碱溶液，然后将该溶液从管子上端倒入，这样，硝酸和钾碱就可以通过黏土相互作用。　　之后，赛勒斯·哈丁取出两个锌片，一片浸入硝酸中，另一片放入钾碱溶液里。这两片锌片之间用一根金属线连接起来，立刻产生了一股电流，电流从瓶子里的锌片传到管子里的锌片。这样，管子里的锌片就成了电池的正极，而瓶子里的锌片则成为电池的负极。因此，把每个瓶子产生的电流集中起来，就足够用来运行电报机了。这就是赛勒斯·哈丁制造的巧妙而简单的设备，它可以使花岗石宫和畜栏之间建立起电报通讯。","The way in which the battery was composed was as follows, and the results were to be attained by the reaction of acid and potash on each other.A number of glass bottles were made and filled with azotic acid.The engineer corked them by means of a stopper through which passed a glass tube, bored at its lower extremity, and intended to be plunged into the acid by means of a clay stopper secured by a rag.Into this tube, through its upper extremity, he poured a solution of potash, previously obtained by burning and reducing to ashes various plants, and in this way the acid and potash could act on each other through the clay.Cyrus Harding then took two slips of zinc, one of which was plunged into azotic acid, the other into a solution of potash.A current was immediately produced, which was transmitted from the slip of zinc in the bottle to that in the tube, and the two slips having been connected by a metallic wire the slip in the tube became the positive pole, and that in the bottle the negative pole of the apparatus.Each bottle, therefore, produced as many currents as united would be sufficient to produce all the phenomena of the electric telegraph.Such was the ingenious and very simple apparatus constructed by Cyrus Harding, an apparatus which would allow them to establish a telegraphic communication between Granite House and the corral."
"居民们从2月6日开始，在通往畜栏的路上竖电线杆，电线杆上都装有玻璃绝缘体，用来支撑电线。几天以后，电线拉好了，电流的传输速度可达每秒两万英里。","On the 6th of February was commenced the planting along the road to the corral, of posts furnished with glass insulators, and intended to support the wire.A few days after, the wire was extended, ready to produce the electric current at a rate of twenty thousand miles a second."
"工程师制造了两套电池，一套放在花岗石宫，另一套放在畜栏。因为畜栏有必要和花岗石宫通讯，同样，花岗石宫和畜栏通讯也是有用的。","Two batteries had been manufactured, one for Granite House, the other for the corral; for if it was necessary the corral should be able to communicate with Granite House it might also be useful that Granite House should be able to communicate with the corral."
"至于收报机和发报机，制造起来很简单。在花岗石宫和畜栏，电线缠绕在一块磁铁上，即缠在一块绕有线圈的软铁上。这样，两个站点之间就建立通讯了，电流从正极出发，通过电线，经过磁铁时，磁铁暂时磁化，然后电流从地下流回负极。电流一旦中断，磁铁就会立刻失去磁性。只要在磁铁的前面放置一片软铁，电流通过时就会吸住它，而电流中断时，它就会掉下来。铁片的运转成功后，哈丁很容易地就能将它安在一个圆盘的指针上，圆盘上标有字母，这样，两地之间就可以联系了。","As to the receiver and manipulator, they were very simple.At the two stations the wire was wound round a magnet, that is to say, round a piece of soft iron surrounded with a wire.The communication was thus established between the two poles; the current, starting from the positive pole, traversed the wire, passed through the magnet which was temporarily magnetized, and returned through the earth to the negative pole.If the current was interrupted, the magnet immediately became unmagnetized.It was sufficient to place a plate of soft iron before the magnet, which, attracted during the passage of the current, would fall back when the current was interrupted.This movement of the plate thus obtained, Harding could easily fasten to it a needle arranged on a dial, bearing the letters of the alphabet, and in this way communicate from one station to the other."
"2月12日，一切工作都完成了。这天，哈丁通过电线发送电流，问畜栏那边是否一切正常，过了一会儿，就从艾尔顿那里收到了令人满意的答复。潘克洛夫欣喜若狂，从此，他每天早晚都发电报去畜栏，往往都能收到回电。","All was completely arranged by the 12th of February.On this day, Harding, having sent the current through the wire, asked if all was going on well at the corral, and received in a few moments a satisfactory reply from Ayrton.Pencroft was wild with joy, and every morning and evening he sent a telegram to the corral, which always received an answer."
"这种通讯方式有两个实在的好处：第一，他们可以确认艾尔顿是否在畜栏；第二，艾尔顿就不至于完全孤单了。此外，赛勒斯·哈丁还是每星期都去看他，艾尔顿也时不时地来花岗石宫，每次他来，都受到热烈的欢迎。","This mode of communication presented two very real advantages: firstly, because it enabled them to ascertain that Ayrton was at the corral; and secondly, that he was thus not left completely isolated.Besides, Cyrus Harding never allowed a week to pass without going to see him, and Ayrton came from time to time to Granite House, where he always found a cordial welcome."
"美好的季节就在日常工作中过去了。开拓队的资源，特别是蔬菜和粮食，一天天地增多，从达抱岛带回来的植物也都完全种活了。","The fine season passed away in the midst of the usual work.The resources of the colony, particularly in vegetables and corn, increased from day to day, and the plants brought from Tabor Island had succeeded perfectly."
"眺望岗的高地上也呈现出一派令人鼓舞的景象。第四次收割又是一次大丰收，想必没有人会去计算收割下来的麦粒有没有四千亿粒了。虽然潘克洛夫曾打算这么干，但是工程师告诉他，即使一分钟能数三百粒，一个小时能数到九千，那也几乎要花上5500年才能完成这项工作，老实的水手想了想，觉得最好还是放弃这个想法。","The plateau of Prospect Heights presented an encouraging aspect.The fourth harvest had been admirable and it may be supposed that no one thought of counting whether the four hundred thousand millions of grains duly appeared in the crop.However, Pencroft had thought of doing so, but Cyrus Harding having told him that even if he managed to count three hundred grains a minute, or nine thousand an hour, it would take him nearly five thousand five-hundred years to finish his task, the honest sailor considered it best to give up the idea."
"天气很好，白天气温高，可到了晚上，海面上吹来的微风调和了大气中的热量，为花岗石宫的居民提供了凉爽的夜晚。在此期间，也有几场暴风雨，虽然持续时间不长，但来势异常迅猛，席卷了整个林肯岛。一连好几个小时，闪电不断，雷声不绝于耳。","The weather was splendid, the temperature very warm in the day time, but in the evening the sea-breezes tempered the heat of the atmosphere and procured cool nights for the inhabitants of Granite House.There were, however, a few storms, which, although they were not of long duration, swept over Lincoln Island with extraordinary fury.The lightning blazed and the thunder continued to roll for some hours."
"这一时期，这块小小的开拓地非常兴旺。","At this period the little colony was extremely prosperous."
"家禽场里的家禽迅速繁殖，居民们就以过剩的家禽为食，但还是有必要把家禽的数量减少到适度的水平。猪已经下崽了，不难理解，为了照料它们，纳布和潘克洛夫花了大量时间。那对野驴也生了两头漂亮的小驴，赫伯特在吉丁·史佩莱的指导下，成了优秀的骑手，他们两人经常骑着野驴出门，他们也把野驴套在车上，有时往花岗石宫运送木柴和煤炭，有时运送工程师所需要的各种矿产。","The tenants of the poultry-yard swarmed, and they lived on the surplus, but it became necessary to reduce the population to a more moderate number.The pigs had already produced young, and it may be understood that their care for these animals absorbed a great part of Neb and Pencroft’s time.The onagers, who had two pretty colts, were most often mounted by Gideon Spilett and Herbert, who had become an excellent rider under the reporter’s instruction, and they also harnessed them to the cart either for carrying wood and coal to Granite House, or different mineral productions required by the engineer."
"在这期间，他们深入远西森林，进行了几次探险。探险者们去那里探险，不用担心酷热，因为阳光很难穿透他们头顶上浓密的枝叶。他们就这样造访了慈悲河的整个左岸，沿着这个河岸就是从畜栏通往瀑布河口的道路。","Several expeditions were made about this time into the depths of the Far West Forests.The explorers could venture there without having anything to fear from the heat, for the sun’s rays scarcely penetrated through the thick foliage spreading above their heads.They thus visited all the left bank of the Mercy, along which ran the road from the corral to the mouth of Falls River."
"不过在这几次探险中，居民们总是小心谨慎，全副武装，因为他们好几次都碰上了野蛮、凶猛的野猪，而且还经常要和它们进行一番搏斗。在这个季节里，他们还和美洲豹进行过激烈的战斗。吉丁·史佩莱对美洲豹有特别的恨意，他的学生赫伯特的恨意仅次于他。由于他们都武装好了，也就不再惧怕碰上这种野兽了。赫伯特非常勇猛，而记者则惊人地冷静。20多张美丽的豹皮已经装饰了花岗石宫的餐厅，如果继续下去，林肯岛上的美洲豹很快就会绝种，而这正是猎手们追求的目标。","But in these excursions the settlers took care to be well armed, for they met with savage wild boars, with which they often had a tussle.They also, during this season, made fierce war against the jaguars.Gideon Spilett had vowed a special hatred against them, and his pupil Herbert seconded him well.Armed as they were, they no longer feared to meet one of those beasts.Herbert’s courage was superb, and the reporter’s sang-froid astonishing.Already twenty magnificent skins ornamented the dining-room of Granite House, and if this continued, the jaguar race would soon be extinct in the island, the object aimed at by the hunters."
"有时候，工程师也参与远征，去岛上的未知区域，每到一处，他都非常仔细地观察。在这广袤森林的繁茂处，他搜寻的不是这些兽迹，而是看有没有其他的踪迹，但没有出现任何令人怀疑的东西。托普和贾普也陪他一起来到这里，它们的行为也表示这里没有什么奇怪的东西，不过托普倒是不止一次地朝井口吠个不停，工程师曾下井勘探过，并没有什么结果。","The engineer sometimes took part in the expeditions made to the unknown parts of the island, which he surveyed with great attention.It was for other traces than those of animals that he searched the thickets of the vast forest, but nothing suspicious ever appeared.Neither Top nor Jup, who accompanied him, ever betrayed by their behavior that there was anything strange there, and yet more than once again the dog barked at the mouth of the well, which the engineer had before explored without result."
"这期间，吉丁·史佩莱在赫伯特的协助下，用在大箱子里找到的摄影装置，在岛上风景最美的地方拍了好几张照片，在此之前，还未曾使用过它。","At this time Gideon Spilett, aided by Herbert, took several views of the most picturesque parts of the island, by means of the photographic apparatus found in the cases, and of which they had not as yet made any use."
"这个装置十分完整，物镜也很强大。印相片所需要的器材有：涂玻璃感光片的火棉胶，使它能够感光的硝酸银，定影用的亚硝酸钠，浸印能产生正片校样的相纸的氯化铵，以及用于浸相纸的醋酸钠和氯化金，一样都不缺。甚至连印相纸也有，一切都准备好了，在把底片放进印相框之前，只需要把印相纸放在硝酸银的溶液里浸泡几分钟。","This apparatus, provided with a powerful object-glass, was very complete.Substances necessary for the photographic reproduction, collodion for preparing the glass plate, nitrate of silver to render it sensitive, hyposulfate of soda to fix the prints obtained, chloride of ammonium in which to soak the paper destined to give the positive proof, acetate of soda and chloride of gold in which to immerse the paper, nothing was wanting.Even the papers were there, all prepared, and before laying in the printing-frame upon the negatives, it was sufficient to soak them for a few minutes in the solution of nitrate of silver."
"记者和他的助手不久便成了非常熟练的摄影师，他们拍了一些漂亮的风景照，例如，以远处的富兰克林山为背景，从眺望岗上拍的林肯岛全景，慈悲河口如画般地被环绕在高高的岩石丛中，以山的支脉为背景的林间空地和畜栏，爪角和残骸角上奇特的地势，等等。","The reporter and his assistant became in a short time very skilful operators, and they obtained fine views of the country, such as the island, taken from Prospect Heights with Mount Franklin in the distance, the mouth of the Mercy, so picturesquely framed in high rocks, the glade and the corral, with the spurs of the mountain in the background, the curious development of Claw Cape, Flotsam Point, etc."
"摄影师们也没有忘记给岛上所有的居民拍照，一个也没有落下。","Nor did the photographers forget to take the portraits of all the inhabitants of the island, leaving out no one."
"“我们大家都有份。”潘克洛夫说道。","“It multiplies us,” said Pencroft."
"看见自己那张十分逼真的照片挂在花岗岩石的墙上，水手非常高兴，他不自觉地停在这个展览前面，仿佛驻足在百老汇挂件最多的商店橱窗前一样。","And the sailor was enchanted to see his own countenance, faithfully reproduced, ornamenting the walls of Granite House, and he stopped as willingly before this exhibition as he would have done before the richest shop-windows in Broadway."
"然而必须承认，拍得最成功的一张照片，无疑要数贾普那张。贾普一本正经地坐着，庄重的神情难以描绘，照片简直和真的一样。","But it must be acknowledged that the most successful portrait was incontestably that of Master Jup.Master Jup had sat with a gravity not to be described, and his portrait was lifelike!"
"“它看起来好像正要露齿而笑！”潘克洛夫叫道。","“He looks as if he was just going to grin!” exclaimed Pencroft."
"如果贾普对此还不满意，那它就太难取悦了，不过它相当高兴，带着一丝深情端详着自己的照片，看上去有几分自负。","And if Master Jup had not been satisfied, he would have been very difficult to please; but he was quite contented and contemplated his own countenance with a sentimental air which expressed some small amount of conceit."
"三月的到来终止了夏季的严热。有些时候下雨，但还是很温暖。这里的三月份相当于北半球的九月，天气并不如人们所期望的那么美好。也许这表明严寒的冬季会提前到来。","The summer heat ended with the month of March.The weather was sometimes rainy, but still warm.The month of March, which corresponds to the September of northern latitudes, was not so fine as might have been hoped.Perhaps it announced an early and rigorous winter."
"21日早晨，大家几乎认为已经看到了初雪——它已经显露面貌了。事实上，赫伯特一大早从花岗岩石的一扇窗前往外望去，忽然大叫起来：","It might have been supposed one morning—the 21 st—that the first snow had already made its appearance.In fact Herbert looking early from one of the windows of Granite House, exclaimed,—"
"“瞧啊！岛上覆盖着雪！”","“Hallo! the islet is covered with snow!”"
"“这时候下雪？”记者一边问，一边向少年走去。","“Snow at this time?” answered the reporter, joining the boy."
"不久伙伴们都走了过来，但他们只能肯定一点，那就是不仅是小岛，连花岗石宫下面的整个海滩，都盖着一层白雪。","Their companions were soon beside them, but could only ascertain one thing, that not only the islet but all the beach below Granite House was covered with one uniform sheet of white."
"“肯定是雪！”潘克洛夫说。","“It must be snow!” said Pencroft."
"“或确切地说，是像雪一样的东西！”纳布回应道。","“Or rather it’s very like it!” replied Neb."
"“可温度计上显示的是58度！”吉丁·史佩莱指出。","“But the thermometer marks fifty-eight degrees!” observed Gideon Spilett."
"赛勒斯·哈丁一声不响地注视着这层白雪，在一年的这个时候，温度又这么高，他确实不知道该如何解释这个现象。","Cyrus Harding gazed at the sheet of white without saying anything, for he really did not know how to explain this phenomenon, at this time of year and in such a temperature."
"“天啊！”潘克洛夫叫了起来，“我们的庄稼都要冻死了！”","“By Jove!” exclaimed Pencroft, “all our plants will be frozen!”"
"水手正打算下去，敏捷的贾普已经抢在他前面，滑到沙滩上去了。","And the sailor was about to descend, when he was preceded by the nimble Jup, who slid down to the sand."
"可是，猩猩还没有落地，大片的雪花飞扬起来，在空中化成无数的絮片，几分钟内把阳光也遮挡住了。","But the orang had not touched the ground, when the snowy sheet arose and dispersed in the air in such innumerable flakes that the light of the sun was obscured for some minutes."
"“是鸟！”赫伯特叫道。","“Birds!” cried Herbert."
"原来真是大群的海鸟，浑身的羽毛洁白耀眼。成千上万只海鸟栖息在小岛和海岸上，直到它们消失在远方的时候，开拓者们很惊讶，好像他们置身在转换的情境中，在仙女的魔杖一触之下，冬天变成了夏天。只可惜这变化太突然了，记者和少年都没来得及打下一只这样的鸟来，因而也无法辨别鸟的种类。","They were indeed swarms of sea-birds, with dazzling white plumage.They had perched by thousands on the islet and on the shore, and they disappeared in the distance, leaving the colonists amazed as if they had been present at some transformation scene, in which summer succeeded winter at the touch of a fairy’s wand.Unfortunately the change had been so sudden, that neither the reporter nor the lad had been able to bring down one of these birds, of which they could not recognize the species."
"几天后是3月26日，这些落难者从空中被抛到林肯岛已经整整两年了。","A few days after came the 26th of March, the day on which, two years before, the castaways from the air had been thrown upon Lincoln Island."
"第十九章","Chapter 19"
"已经两年了！开拓者们已经两年没有和他们的同胞取得任何联系了！他们没有文明世界的消息，流落在这荒岛上，仿佛完全处在天上最微小的星球上。","Two years already! and for two years the colonists had had no communication with their fellow-creatures!They were without news from the civilized world, lost on this island, as completely as if they had been on the most minute star of the celestial hemisphere!"
"现在他们的祖国会发生什么事呢？故乡的情景常常浮现在他们眼前，当他们离开的时候，故乡正饱受内战之苦，也许南方的叛徒还在流着血呢！对他们来说，这是最痛心的事，他们经常谈论这些，但他们毫不怀疑，北军为美利坚合众国的荣誉而战的事业终将取得胜利。","What was now happening in their country?The picture of their native land was always before their eyes, the land torn by civil war at the time they left it, and which the Southern rebellion was perhaps still staining with blood!It was a great sorrow to them, and they often talked together of these things, without ever doubting however that the cause of the North must triumph, for the honor of the American Confederation."
"在这两年里，他们从未见到过有船只驶过海岛，至少连帆影也没看见过。显然林肯岛不在通常的航线上，并且也没有人知道有这样一个岛——这一点可以从地图上得到证明——这里虽没有港口，船只也可能来这里补充淡水储备。一眼望去，林肯岛周围的海面上一片荒芜，开拓者们只能依靠自己重新回到祖国。","During these two years not a vessel had passed in sight of the island; or, at least, not a sail had been seen.It was evident that Lincoln Island was out of the usual track, and also that it was unknown,—as was besides proved by the maps,—for though there was no port, vessels might have visited it for the purpose of renewing their store of water.But the surrounding ocean was deserted as far as the eye could reach, and the colonists must rely on themselves for regaining their native land."
"不过，还有一个得救的机会，在四月第一周的一天，开拓者们聚集在花岗石宫的餐厅里，讨论这个机会。","However, one chance of rescue existed, and this chance was discussed one day on the first week of April, when the colonists were gathered together in the dining-room of Granite House."
"他们谈到了美国，谈起了故乡，觉得再看到故乡的希望很渺茫。","They had been talking of America, of their native country, which they had so little hope of ever seeing again."
"“毫无疑问，我们只有一个办法，”史佩莱说，“只有这个办法可以离开林肯岛，那就是造一艘足够大的船，可以在海上航行几百英里。依我看来，既然能造小船，造大船应该也不难！”","“Decidedly we have only one way, said Spilett, “one single way for leaving Lincoln Island, and that is, to build a vessel large enough to sail several hundred miles.It appears to me, that when one has built a boat it is just as easy to build a ship!”"
"“有了大船，我们就可以去帕摩图群岛了，”赫伯特补充道，“就像我们去达抱岛一样容易。”","“And in which we might go to the Pomoutous,” added Herbert, “just as easily as we went to Tabor Island.”"
"“我不反对，”潘克洛夫说，在有关航海的问题上，他总是起决定性的作用，“尽管近海航行和远洋航行不完全一样，但这件事我并不反对。在我们去达抱岛的途中，不管小船遇到多大的狂风，我们清楚海岸就在不远处，但1200海里可是一段相当长的航程，而离我们最近的陆地至少也有这样长的距离！”","“I do not say no,” replied Pencroft, who had always the casting vote in maritime questions; “I do not say no, although it is not exactly the same thing to make a long as a short voyage!If our little craft had been caught in any heavy gale of wind during the voyage to Tabor Island, we should have known that land was at no great distance either way; but twelve hundred miles is a pretty long way, and the nearest land is at least that distance!”"
"“潘克洛夫，在这种情况下，你不想冒险吗？”记者问道。","“Would you not, in that case, Pencroft, attempt the adventure?” asked the reporter."
"“只要大家愿意，我可以尝试任何风险，史佩莱先生，”水手答道，“你们知道，我是个不会退缩的人！”","“I will attempt anything that is desired, Mr. Spilett,” answered the sailor, “and you know well that I am not a man to flinch!”"
"“而且，别忘了，我们现在又多了一名水手。”纳布提醒道。","“Remember, besides, that we number another sailor amongst us now,” remarked Neb."
"“谁呀？”潘克洛夫问。","“Who is that?” asked Pencroft."
"“艾尔顿。”","“Ayrton.”"
"“要是他愿意加入就好了。”潘克洛夫说。","“If he will consent to come,” said Pencroft."
"“废话！”记者接着说，“如果艾尔顿还住在达抱岛，格里那凡爵士的游艇开来了，你想他会拒绝离开吗？”","“Nonsense!” returned the reporter; “do you think that if Lord Glenarvan’s yacht had appeared at Tabor Island, while he was still living there, Ayrton would have refused to depart?”"
"“朋友们，你们忘了，”此时赛勒斯·哈丁说道，“艾尔顿住在岛上的最后几年已丧失了理智。但问题不在那里。问题在于我们能不能把获救的希望放在苏格兰游船归来上。既然格里那凡爵士曾答应过艾尔顿，等到他认为赎清罪恶的时候，就会来接他离开达抱岛，那么我相信他会回来的。”","“You forget, my friends,” then said Cyrus Harding, “that Ayrton was not in possession of his reason during the last years of his stay there.But that is not the question.The point is to know if we may count among our chances of being rescued, the return of the Scotch vessel.Now, Lord Glenarvan promised Ayrton that he would return to take him off from Tabor Island when he considered that his crimes were expiated, and I believe that he will return.”"
"“对，”记者说，“我还要补充一点，爵士很快就会回来，因为艾尔顿被丢弃在岛上已经12年了。”","“Yes,” said the reporter, “and I will add that he will return soon, for it is twelve years since Ayrton was abandoned.”"
"“好！”潘克洛夫说，“我同意你说的，爵士会回来，而且很快就会来。但他的船会停靠在哪里呢？是达抱岛，而不是林肯岛。”","“Well!” answered Pencroft, “I agree with you that the nobleman will return, and soon too.But where will he touch?At Tabor Island, and not at Lincoln Island.”"
"“这更可以肯定了，”赫伯特说，“因为地图上根本就没有标出林肯岛。”","“That is the more certain,” replied Herbert, “as Lincoln Island is not even marked on the map.”"
"“所以，朋友们，”工程师说，“我们应该采取必要的预防措施，让达抱岛上的人知道我们和艾尔顿在林肯岛。”","“Therefore, my friends,” said the engineer, “we ought to take the necessary precautions for making our presence and that of Ayrton on Lincoln Island known at Tabor Island.”"
"“当然，”记者说，“这很好办，只要在格兰特船长和艾尔顿住过的棚子里留下一张字条，写明我们这个岛的位置，格里那凡爵士和他的船员肯定会发现的。”","“Certainly,” answered the reporter, “and nothing is easier than to place in the hut, which was Captain Grant’s and Ayrton’s dwelling, a notice which Lord Glenarvan and his crew cannot help finding, giving the position of our island.”"
"“真遗憾，”水手说，“我们第一次去达抱岛的时候，就忘记了采取这个防范措施。”","“It is a pity,” remarked the sailor, “that we forgot to take that precaution on our first visit to Tabor Island.”"
"“我们当时怎么会想到要这样做呢？”赫伯特回答说，“那时候我们还不清楚艾尔顿的历史，也不知道有一天可能有人来接走他，现在知道了他的故事，可又错过了季节，不允许我们无法再回到达抱岛了。”","“And why should we have done it?” asked Herbert.“At that time we did not know Ayrton’s history; we did not know that any one was likely to come some day to fetch him, and when we did know his history, the season was too advanced to allow us to return then to Tabor Island.”"
"“是的，”哈丁说，“现在太迟了，只好把这个航行推迟到明年春天。”","“Yes,” replied Harding, “it was too late, and we must put off the voyage until next spring.”"
"“不过，要是苏格兰游船在那之前已经来了……”潘克洛夫说。","“But suppose the Scotch yacht comes before that,” said Pencroft."
"“这不大可能，”工程师回答道，“因为格里那凡爵士不会在冬季进行远洋冒险的。或者他已经回过达抱岛，但由于艾尔顿和我们在一起，也就是说，在过去的五个月里，他又离开了；或者他会晚些时候才来，这样等十月天气一好转，我们就有足够时间去达抱岛，留一张字条在那里。”","“That is not probable,” replied the engineer, “for Lord Glenarvan would not choose the winter season to venture into these seas.Either he has already returned to Tabor Island, since Ayrton has been with us, that is to say, during the last five months and has left again; or he will not come till later, and it will be time enough in the first fine October days to go to Tabor Island, and leave a notice there.”"
"“我们必须考虑，”纳布说道，“假如‘邓肯’号在几个月前刚回过那里，那就太不走运了！”","“We must allow,” said Neb, “that it will be very unfortunate if the ‘Duncan’ has returned to these parts only a few months ago!”"
"“但愿事实不是那样，”赛勒斯·哈丁说，“但愿上天不要剥夺我们剩下的最佳机会。”","“I hope that it is not so,” replied Cyrus Harding, “and that Heaven has not deprived us of the best chance which remains to us.”"
"“我想，”记者提出，“不管怎样，我们去过达抱岛后，就会知道该怎么办，因为如果游船已经去过那里，他们一定会留下一些到访过的痕迹。”","“I think,” observed the reporter, “that at any rate we shall know what we have to depend on when we have been to Tabor Island, for if the yacht has returned there, they will necessarily have left some traces of their visit.”"
"“那是肯定的，”工程师回答说，“因此，朋友们，既然我们有这次回国的机会，就应该耐心等待，如果失去了这次机会，我们再看最好该做什么。”","“That is evident,” answered the engineer.“So then, my friends, since we have this chance of returning to our country, we must wait patiently, and if it is taken from us we shall see what will be best to do.”"
"“无论怎样，”潘克洛夫说，“我们都清楚，如果我们真的离开了林肯岛，那绝不是因为我们在这里住得不舒服。”","“At any rate,” remarked Pencroft, “it is well understood that if we do leave Lincoln Island, it will not be because we were uncomfortable there!”"
"“你说得对，潘克洛夫，”工程师说，“这只是因为在岛上，我们远离了一个人在世界上最珍爱的一切：家庭、朋友和祖国！”","“No, Pencroft,” replied the engineer, “it will be because we are far from all that a man holds dearest in the world, his family, his friends, his native land!”"
"事情就这样定下后，居民们就不再提造大船去北方的太平洋群岛，或是去西方的新西兰，而只是忙于一些日常工作，为了在花岗石宫度过第三个冬天。","Matters being thus decided, the building of a vessel large enough to sail either to the Archipelagoes in the north, or to New Zealand in the west, was no longer talked of, and they busied themselves in their accustomed occupations, with a view to wintering a third time in Granite House."
"不过，他们还是一致同意，在暴风天气到来之前，驾驶小船进行一次环岛航行。居民们还没有彻底考察整个海岸，从瀑布河口到颚角西岸和北岸，以及颚骨角之间像鲨鱼嘴张开的狭长海湾，对这些地带的情况了解得都不完整。","However, it was agreed that before the stormy weather came on, their little vessel should be employed in making a voyage round the island.A complete survey of the coast had not yet been made, and the colonists had but an imperfect idea of the shore to the west and north, from the mouth of Falls River to the Mandible Capes, as well as of the narrow bay between them, which opened like a shark’s jaws."
"这次出海的计划是潘克洛夫提出来的，赛勒斯·哈丁对此完全赞同，因为他很想亲自看看他的这部分领地。","The plan of this excursion was proposed by Pencroft, and Cyrus Harding fully acquiesced in it, for he himself wished to see this part of his domain."
"天气变幻莫测，不过气压表没有因突然变化而波动，因此他们可以依靠这种过得去的天气。然而，在四月的第一个星期，气压计急剧下降后，五六天的狂风之后，又重新升高了。然后气压表的指针停留在二十九又十分之九英寸的高度上，天气看起来很适合航海。","The weather was variable, but the barometer did not fluctuate by sudden movements, and they could therefore count on tolerable weather.However, during the first week of April, after a sudden barometrical fall, a renewed rise was marked by a heavy gale of wind, lasting five or six days; then the needle of the instrument remained stationary at a height of twenty-nine inches and nine-tenths, and the weather appeared propitious for an excursion."
"出发的日子定在4月16号，停靠在气球港的“乘风破浪”号装足了食物，准备作一次为期不短的航行。","The departure was fixed for the 16th of April, and the “Bonadventure,” anchored in Port Balloon, was provisioned for a voyage which might be of some duration."
"赛勒斯·哈丁把这次探险的计划也告诉了艾尔顿，并建议他也加入，可艾尔顿更愿意留在岛上，最后决定大伙不在时，艾尔顿必须到花岗石宫来。贾普奉命留下来陪艾尔顿，他没有提出抗议。","Cyrus Harding informed Ayrton of the projected expedition, and proposed that he should take part in it, but Ayrton preferring to remain on shore, it was decided that he should come to Granite House during the absence of his companions.Master Jup was ordered to keep him company, and made no remonstrance."
"4月16日清晨，全体开拓者，包括托普，都上船了。微风从南面吹来，“乘风破浪”号离开气球港，抢风转变航向，为了到达爬虫角。林肯岛的周长为90英里，从气球港到爬虫角之间的南岸长20英里。由于刮的是迎头风，因此必须靠近海岸行驶。","On the morning of the 16th of April all the colonists, including Top, embarked.A fine breeze blew from the south-west, and the “Bonadventure” tacked on leaving Port Balloon so as to reach Reptile End.Of the ninety miles which the perimeter of the island measured, twenty included the south coast between the port and the promontory.The wind being right ahead it was necessary to hug the shore."
"他们花了一整天的时间才到达爬虫角，由于船离开气球港后，只碰到两个小时的退潮，因此，他们花了六个小时和潮水作斗争，开出路来。绕过爬虫角的时候，已经是傍晚了。","It took the whole day to reach the promontory, for the vessel on leaving port had only two hours of ebb tide and had therefore to make way for six hours against the flood.It was nightfall before the promontory was doubled."
"水手建议工程师收缩两帆，继续慢速前行。但哈丁更希望在离岸几锚链远的地方停泊，以便明天白天勘察这部分海岸。同时，因为他们急于仔细勘察海岸，大家也一致同意夜间停航，而且只要天气条件允许，就尽量把船停靠在岸边。","The sailor then proposed to the engineer that they should continue sailing slowly with two reefs in the sail.But Harding preferred to anchor a few cable-lengths from the shore, so as to survey that part of the coast during the day.It was agreed also that as they were anxious for a minute exploration of the coast they should not sail during the night, but would always, when the weather permitted it, be at anchor near the shore."
"他们就在爬虫角下边过了一夜，风停了，四周万籁俱寂。除了水手以外，“乘风破浪”号上的旅客都不像在花岗石宫的房间里那样睡得安稳，不过他们终究还是睡了。第二天，天刚蒙蒙亮，潘克洛夫就起航了，只要保持左舷抢风航行，就可以沿着西岸前行。","The night was passed under the promontory, and the wind having fallen, nothing disturbed the silence.The passengers, with the exception of the sailor, scarcely slept as well on board the “Bonadventure” as they would have done in their rooms at Granite House, but they did sleep however.Pencroft set sail at break of day, and by going on the larboard tack they could keep close to the shore."
"开拓者们对这一片美丽的森林海岸很熟悉，尽管他们曾经徒步来这里探索过，然而再次看到时，大家还是赞叹不已。他们尽量沿着岸边行驶，以便观察每件事物，只是要时刻小心，不要撞到海面上到处漂浮的树干。他们也好几次停下船，让吉丁·史佩莱拍些优美的风景照。","The colonists knew this beautiful wooded coast, since they had already explored it on foot, and yet it again excited their admiration.They coasted along as close in as possible, so as to notice everything, avoiding always the trunks of trees which floated here and there.Several times also they anchored, and Gideon Spilett took photographs of the superb scenery."
"将近中午时分，“乘风破浪”号抵达瀑布河口。在左岸，可以看到稀疏的树木，而在三英里以外，只有西面山的支脉之间独立地长着一簇一簇树木，荒芜的山脊倾斜下来，一直延伸到海岸一带。","About noon the “Bonadventure” arrived at the mouth of Falls River.Beyond, on the left bank, a few scattered trees appeared, and three miles further even these dwindled into solitary groups among the western spurs of the mountain, whose arid ridge sloped down to the shore."
"海岸南部和北部的反差多大啊！相比之下，一边是树木葱郁，土壤肥沃，而另一边则是崎岖不平，荒凉贫瘠。就如在某些国家里，人们把后者称为“铁海岸”，它那荒芜杂乱的外形，似乎表明这是在远古时代的地质海里，由仍是液体的玄武岩突然产生结晶而形成的。如果当初居民们先是降落在这部分岛上，他们肯定会被这些巨大的石头吓到。他们从富兰克林山顶上眺望时，由于站得太高，无法看到此海岸险恶的一面，但从海上看，它呈现出荒凉的一面，也许世界的任何角落都无法与它比拟。","What a contrast between the northern and southern part of the coast!In proportion as one was woody and fertile so was the other rugged and barren!It might have been designated as one of those iron coasts, as they are called in some countries, and its wild confusion appeared to indicate that a sudden crystallization had been produced in the yet liquid basalt of some distant geological sea.These stupendous masses would have terrified the settlers if they had been cast at first on this part of the island!They had not been able to perceive the sinister aspect of this shore from the summit of Mount Franklin, for they overlooked it from too great a height, but viewed from the sea it presented a wild appearance which could not perhaps be equaled in any corner of the globe."
"“乘风破浪”号沿着海岸行驶了半英里。可以轻易看出，岸上尽是大小不一的一块块岩石，高度从20英尺到300英尺不等，形状也各不相同，有的圆如塔，有的棱柱如尖顶，有的锥体如方尖石碑，还有如同工厂大烟囱的圆锥形。即使是北冰洋上的冰山，也未必有这种千姿百态的凌人气派！这边是横跨岩石的桥，那边是如海浪般的拱门，目光都无法看透其深度；这边巨大的拱形洞穴呈现出不朽的气派，那边竖立着一排排的石柱、尖塔和拱门，任何一个哥特式的大教堂都不曾有这样的景致。这些自然界巧夺天工的作品，远比人们的想象力丰富，它们在这八九英里的壮丽海滨地带延伸着。","The “Bonadventure” sailed along this coast for the distance of half a mile.It was easy to see that it was composed of blocks of all sizes, from twenty to three hundred feet in height, and of all shapes, round like towers, prismatic like steeples, pyramidal like obelisks, conical like factory chimneys.An iceberg of the Polar seas could not have been more capricious in its terrible sublimity!Here, bridges were thrown from one rock to another; there, arches like those of a wave, into the depths of which the eye could not penetrate; in one place, large vaulted excavations presented a monumental aspect; in another, a crowd of columns, spires, and arches, such as no Gothic cathedral ever possessed.Every caprice of nature, still more varied than those of the imagination, appeared on this grand coast, which extended over a length of eight or nine miles."
"赛勒斯·哈丁和他的同伴们带着惊奇的心情，注视着这一切，几乎沉醉其中。虽然他们都默不作声，可托普却没被这种心情困扰，它叫了几声，从玄武岩的峭壁那边传来一声声回音。工程师甚至发现这狗的叫声有些奇怪，就和它在花岗石宫的井口发出的叫声类似。","Cyrus Harding and his companions gazed, with a feeling of surprise bordering on stupefaction.But, although they remained silent, Top, not being troubled with feelings of this sort, uttered barks which were repeated by the thousand echoes of the basaltic cliff.The engineer even observed that these barks had something strange in them, like those which the dog had uttered at the mouth of the well in Granite House."
"“我们靠近些吧。”他说。","“Let us go close in,” said he."
"于是，“乘风破浪”号尽可能靠着石头遍布的海岸航行。也许那里有某个值得勘探的洞穴呢？可哈丁什么也没发现，既没有洞穴，也没有一个裂缝可供任何一样东西藏身，因为峭壁的底部被海浪冲刷着。不久，托普就停止了吠叫，船仍与海岸保持几锚链的距离，继续前行。","And the “Bonadventure” sailed as near as possible to the rocky shore.Perhaps some cave, which it would be advisable to explore, existed there?But Harding saw nothing, not a cavern, not a cleft which could serve as a retreat to any being whatever, for the foot of the cliff was washed by the surf.Soon Top’s barks ceased, and the vessel continued her course at a few cables-length from the coast."
"在岛的西北部，海岸又变得平坦而多沙了。在一片低洼的沼泽地上，到处生长着一些树木，开拓者们也曾到这里勘探过，与刚才所见的荒凉的海岸形成鲜明对比，这里出现的无数水鸟又一次呈现出生命的气息。当晚，“乘风破浪”号就在小岛北面靠近陆地的一个小海湾停了下来，此处的海水非常深。这一夜过得非常平静，随着白天最后一道光的消失，微风也停息了，第二天破晓，才又吹起来。","In the northwest part of the island the shore became again flat and sandy.A few trees here and there rose above a low, marshy ground, which the colonists had already surveyed, and in violent contrast to the other desert shore, life was again manifested by the presence of myriads of water-fowl.That evening the “Bonadventure” anchored in a small bay to the north of the island, near the land, such was the depth of water there.The night passed quietly, for the breeze died away with the last light of day, and only rose again with the first streaks of dawn."
"由于上岸容易，开拓地一贯的猎手，也就是赫伯特和吉丁·史佩莱，就去游逛了约两个小时，带回来好几串野鸭和鹬。托普表现极佳，多亏了它的热心和机敏，一只猎物也没有丢失。","As it was easy to land, the usual hunters of the colony, that is to say, Herbert and Gideon Spilett, went for a ramble of two hours or so, and returned with several strings of wild duck and snipe.Top had done wonders, and not a bird had been lost, thanks to his zeal and cleverness."
"早上八点钟，“乘风破浪”号起航了，由于正赶上顺风，而且风势逐渐加大，它飞快地直奔北颚角。","At eight o’clock in the morning the “Bonadventure” set sail, and ran rapidly towards North Mandible Cape, for the wind was right astern and freshening rapidly."
"“不过，”潘克洛夫指出，“如果猛烈的风从西面刮来，我不会感到奇怪。昨天太阳下山时，西面地平线红彤彤的一片，今天早上又出现了马尾云，这不是好兆头。”","“However,” observed Pencroft, “I should not be surprised if a gale came up from the west.Yesterday the sun set in a very red-looking horizon, and now, this morning, those mares-tails don’t forbode anything good.”"
"马尾云是一种卷云，它们散布在离海面不到5000英尺的高空。这种云看起来像一片片轻柔的原棉，通常预示天气将要发生突变。","These mares-tails are cirrus clouds, scattered in the zenith, their height from the sea being less than five thousand feet.They look like light pieces of cotton wool, and their presence usually announces some sudden change in the weather."
"“那好，”哈丁说，“我们把帆尽量都升起来，赶快到鲨鱼湾去避一避。我想‘乘风破浪’号在那里会很安全。”","“Well,” said Harding, “let us carry as much sail as possible, and run for shelter into Shark Gulf.I think that the ‘Bonadventure’ will be safe there.”"
"“太棒了，”潘克洛夫说，“而且北边的海岸尽是沙子，看起来非常没意思。”","“Perfectly,” replied Pencroft, “and besides, the north coast is merely sand, very uninteresting to look at.”"
"“我不会感到遗憾，”工程师接着说，“不但今天要呆在鲨鱼湾，明天也是，那里值得仔细勘探一番。”","“I shall not be sorry,” resumed the engineer, “to pass not only to-night but to-morrow in that bay, which is worth being carefully explored.”"
"“我想我们不得不那样做，不管我们愿不愿意，”潘克洛夫说，“因为西边的天空看起来非常险恶。坏天气马上要来了！”","“I think that we shall be obliged to do so, whether we like it or not,” answered Pencroft, “for the sky looks very threatening towards the west.Dirty weather is coming on!”"
"“不管怎样，我们去颚骨角总是顺风的。”记者说道。","“At any rate we have a favorable wind for reaching Cape Mandible,” observed the reporter."
"“风倒是顺风，”水手说，“不过进入海湾时，必须抢风行驶，但愿能够顺利通过这个陌生的海域。”","“A very fine wind,” replied the sailor; “but we must tack to enter the gulf, and I should like to see my way clear in these unknown quarters.”"
"“这部分海域礁石不少，”赫伯特补充道，“如果根据我们在鲨鱼湾南岸所看到的情况。”","“Quarters which appear to be filled with rocks,” added Herbert, “if we judge by what we saw on the south coast of Shark Gulf.”"
"“潘克洛夫，”赛勒斯·哈丁说，“按你想的最好方案做吧，我们把它交给你了。”","“Pencroft,” said Cyrus Harding, “do as you think best, we will leave it to you.”"
"“放心吧，上尉，”水手说，“如果没必要，我不会去冒险！我宁愿让刀子刺进我的肋骨，也决不让礁石进入我的‘乘风破浪’号！”","“Don’t make your mind uneasy, captain,” replied the sailor, “I shall not expose myself needlessly!I would rather a knife were run into my ribs than a sharp rock into those of my ‘Bonadventure!’”"
"潘克洛夫所说的肋骨，就是船浸在水下的那部分，他把它看得比自己的皮肉还重要。","That which Pencroft called ribs was the pan of his vessel under water, and he valued it more than his own skin."
"“几点钟了？”潘克洛夫问道。","“What o’clock is it?” asked Pencroft."
"“十点钟。”吉丁·史佩莱回答说。","“Ten o’clock,” replied Gideon Spilett."
"“上尉，我们离颚角还有多远？”","“And what distance is it to the Cape, captain?”"
"“大概还有15英里。”工程师回答说。","“About fifteen miles,” replied the engineer."
"“也就是两个半小时的事情，”水手说，“十二点到一点之间，我们应该可以到达颚骨角附近了。糟糕的是，那时候正赶上退潮，海水要从海湾向外流出。既不顺风也不顺水，恐怕很难进湾。”","“That’s a matter of two hours and a half,” said the sailor, “and we shall be off the Cape between twelve and one o’clock.Unluckily, the tide will be turning at that moment, and will be ebbing out of the gulf.I am afraid that it will be very difficult to get in, having both wind and tide against us.”"
"“加上今天又是满月，”赫伯特指出，“四月的潮水势头很猛。”","“And the more so that it is a full moon to-day,” remarked Herbert, “and these April tides are very strong.”"
"“那么，潘克洛夫，”哈丁问道，“你能不能把船停在颚骨角附近呢？”","“Well, Pencroft,” asked Harding, “can you not anchor off the Cape?”"
"“趁着天气没有变坏，在靠近陆地的地方抛锚！”水手大叫道，“上尉，你在想什么？我们非搁浅不可！”","“Anchor near land, with bad weather coming on!” exclaimed the sailor.“What are you thinking of, captain?We should run aground, of a certainty!”"
"“那么，你打算怎么办？”","“What will you do then?”"
"“我要设法在海上一直呆到涨潮，也就是到晚上七点左右，如果那时还有光亮，我就想办法驶进海湾；否则，我们只好整夜断断续续地行驶，等到明天太阳升起的时候再进海湾。”","“I shall try to keep in the offing until the flood, that is to say, till about seven in the evening, and if there is still light enough I will try to enter the gulf; if not, we must stand off and on during the night, and we will enter to-morrow at sunrise.”"
"“我已经对你说过了，潘克洛夫，这件事情我们就交给你了。”哈丁说。","“As I told you, Pencroft, we will leave it to you,” answered Harding."
"“唉！”潘克洛夫说，“海岸上要是有一座灯塔，对水手来说就方便多了。”","“Ah!” said Pencroft, “if there was only a lighthouse on the coast, it would be much more convenient for sailors.”"
"“是的，”赫伯特说，“这一次可没有体贴的工程师为我们点火，引我们入港了！”","“Yes,” replied Herbert, “and this time we shall have no obliging engineer to light a fire to guide us into port!”"
"“说实话，亲爱的赛勒斯，”史佩莱说，“我们还没有谢过你呢，但老实说，要是没有那堆火，我们绝不能——”","“Why, indeed, my dear Cyrus,” said Spilett, “we have never thanked you; but frankly, without that fire we should never have been able—”"
"“火？”哈丁听了记者的话后，非常惊讶地问道。","“A fire?” asked Harding, much astonished at the reporter’s words."
"“上尉，我们指的是，”潘克洛夫回答说，“上次我们回林肯岛的最后几个小时里，我们在‘乘风破浪’号上非常担心，要不是你在10月18日夜里的防范措施，在眺望岗上点燃火堆，我们就可能开到林肯岛的上风头去了。”","“We mean, captain,” answered Pencroft, “that on board the ‘Bonadventure’ we were very anxious during the few hours before our return, and we should have passed to windward of the island, if it had not been for the precaution you took of lighting a fire the night of the 19th of October, on Prospect Heights.”"
"“是的，是的！那是我想出的好主意！”工程师说。","“Yes, yes!That was a lucky idea of mine!” replied the engineer."
"“而这一次，”水手接着说，“除非艾尔顿想到这一点，否则就不会有人帮我们这个小忙了！”","“And this time,” continued the sailor. “unless the idea occurs to Ayrton, there will be no one to do us that little service!”"
"“不会了！不会有人了！”赛勒斯·哈丁回答说。","“No!No one!” answered Cyrus Harding."
"几分钟后，工程师看只剩他自己和记者在船头，便俯下身来，低声对记者说：","A few minutes after, finding himself alone in the bows of the vessel, with the reporter, the engineer bent down and whispered,—"
"“史佩莱，如果在这个世界上有一件可以肯定的事，那就是在10月19日的夜晚，我绝没有在眺望岗或是岛上其他任何地方点过火！”","“If there is one thing certain in this world, Spilett, it is that I never lighted any fire during the night of the 19th of October, neither on Prospect Heights nor on any other part of the island!”"
"第二十章","Chapter 20"
"潘克洛夫的预感很少会错，事情正如他所预料的那样发生了。风力逐渐加大，很快就从清新的微风变成了正常的狂风，也就是说，风速达到每小时40至45英里，在这种情况下，海面上的船只都会收帆行驶。接近六点钟的时候，“乘风破浪”号到了海湾，但那时潮势变了，船无法入港。于是，他们只好与海岸保持一定距离，因为即使潘克洛夫想进慈悲河口，他也办不到了。他把三角帆作为暴风帆升到主桅的顶上，使船头对着陆地，把船停了下来。","Things happened as Pencroft had predicted, he being seldom mistaken in his prognostications.The wind rose, and from a fresh breeze it soon increased to a regular gale; that is to say, it acquired a speed of from forty to forty-five miles an hour, before which a ship in the open sea would have run under close-reefed topsails.Now, as it was nearly six o’clock when the “Bonadventure” reached the gulf, and as at that moment the tide turned, it was impossible to enter.They were therefore compelled to stand off, for even if he had wished to do so, Pencroft could not have gained the mouth of the Mercy.Hoisting the jib to the mainmast by way of a storm-sail, he hove to, putting the head of the vessel towards the land."
"虽然风势很猛，但幸好有陆地挡着，海浪并不大。因此大家不必担心常常对小船造成危险的海浪了。“乘风破浪”号的压舱情况良好，绝不会翻船，不过，如果大量的海水落到甲板上，而船板又经受不住它们，船就会受损。作为一名优秀的水手，潘克洛夫对一切可能发生的事故都作好了防备。当然，他对自己的这艘船非常有信心，不过他还是怀着几分焦虑的心情，等待着明天。","Fortunately, although the wind was strong the sea, being sheltered by the land, did not run very high.They had then little to fear from the waves, which always endanger small craft.The “Bonadventure” would doubtlessly not have capsized, for she was well ballasted, but enormous masses of water falling on the deck might injure her if her timbers could not sustain them.Pencroft, as a good sailor, was prepared for anything.Certainly, he had great confidence in his vessel, but nevertheless he awaited the return of day with some anxiety."
"这天夜里，赛勒斯·哈丁和吉丁·史佩莱没有机会交谈，不过工程师在记者耳旁说的那些话，以及似乎支配林肯岛的这股神秘力量，都值得讨论一番。吉丁·史佩莱不断想着荒岛海岸上出现火光这又一件不可思议的事情。他确确实实看见了那火光！他的同伴，赫伯特和潘克洛夫，和他一样也看见了！这火光使他们在漆黑的夜里辨别出林肯岛的位置，他们从不怀疑火是工程师点燃的，而现在赛勒斯·哈丁却明确表示他绝没有做过这件事！史佩莱决定等“乘风破浪”号一回去，就马上重提此事，并催促赛勒斯·哈丁把这些奇怪的事实告诉伙伴们。也许大家会作出决定，共同对林肯岛的每个部分进行一次彻底的搜查。","During the night, Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett had no opportunity for talking together, and yet the words pronounced in the reporter’s ear by the engineer were well worth being discussed, together with the mysterious influence which appeared to reign over Lincoln Island.Gideon Spilett did not cease from pondering over this new and inexplicable incident, the appearance of a fire on the coast of the island.The fire had actually been seen!His companions, Herbert and Pencroft, had seen it with him!The fire had served to signalize the position of the island during that dark night, and they had not doubted that it was lighted by the engineer’s hand; and here was Cyrus Harding expressly declaring that he had never done anything of the sort!Spilett resolved to recur to this incident as soon as the “Bonadventure” returned, and to urge Cyrus Harding to acquaint their companions with these strange facts.Perhaps it would be decided to make in common a complete investigation of every part of Lincoln Island."
"不管怎样，这天晚上，在海湾入口处陌生的海岸上，没有任何火光，而小船就整夜停泊在海面上。","However that might be, on this evening no fire was lighted on these yet unknown shores, which formed the entrance to the gulf, and the little vessel stood off during the night."
"当东方的海平面上晨曦初照时，风势也稍稍减弱了些，并且改变了两个方位，这使得潘克洛夫可以轻而易举地把船驶进窄小的港湾。早上接近七点的时候，“乘风破浪”号经受住风浪，朝着北颚角的方向，进入海峡，滑到这片水域中，这里四面都是千奇百怪的熔岩峭壁。","When the first streaks of dawn appeared in the western horizon, the wind, which had slightly fallen, shifted two points, and enabled Pencroft to enter the narrow gulf with greater ease.Towards seven o’clock in the morning, the “Bonadventure,” weathering the North Mandible Cape, entered the strait and glided on to the waters, so strangely enclosed in the frame of lava."
"“嗯，”潘克洛夫说，“这个海湾的航道真好，一整个舰队也能轻易停下！”","“Well,” said Pencroft, “this bay would make admirable roads, in which a whole fleet could lie at their ease!”"
"“特别奇怪的是，”哈丁指出，“这海湾是由两波大量的熔岩形成，因为有连续两次火山喷发的积累。结果海湾的四周都被遮挡住了，我相信，即使是在暴风雨最猛烈的天气，这里的海水也会像湖面一样平静。”","“What is especially curious,” observed Harding, “is that the gulf has been formed by two rivers of lava, thrown out by the volcano, and accumulated by successive eruptions.The result is that the gulf is completely sheltered on all sides, and I believe that even in the stormiest weather, the sea here must be as calm as a lake.”"
"“当然，”水手接着说，“由于这里的风只能从两个海角的狭窄通道吹进来，而且，北边的海角还遮挡着南边的海角，这样狂风就难以长驱直入了。我敢说，我们的‘乘风破浪’号在这里可以从今年年底停到明年年底，甚至锚也一动不动！”","“No doubt,” returned the sailor, “since the wind has only that narrow entrance between the two capes to get in by, and, besides, the north cape protects that of the south in a way which would make the entrance of gusts very difficult.I declare our ‘Bonadventure’ could stay here from one end of the year to the other, without even dragging at her anchor!”"
"“对它而言，这个港湾相当大！”记者说。","“It is rather large for her!” observed the reporter."
"“不错！史佩莱先生，”水手回答说，“我承认对‘乘风破浪’号来说，这个港湾是太大了，但如果美国的舰队想在太平洋上找一个港口，我想找不到比这更好的地方了！”","“Well!Mr. Spilett,” replied the sailor, “I agree that it is too large for the ‘Bonadventure,’ but if the fleets of the Union were in want of a harbor in the Pacific, I don’t think they would ever find a better place than this!”"
"“现在我们在鲨鱼的嘴里呢。”纳布说道，他暗指海湾的形状。","“We are in the shark’s mouth,” remarked Nab, alluding to the form of the gulf."
"“正是在它的嘴中间，老实的纳布！”赫伯特回答说，“不过，你不会担心它会闭上嘴，把我们关在里面吧？”","“Right into its mouth, my honest Nab!” replied Herbert, “but you are not afraid that it will shut upon us, are you?”"
"“不会的，赫伯特先生，”纳布答道，“但是我不大喜欢这个港湾！它的样子很凶恶！”","“No, Mr. Herbert,” answered Neb, “and yet this gulf here doesn’t please me much!It has a wicked look!”"
"“好呀！”潘克洛夫大叫道，“我正考虑要把这个港湾献给美国，纳布却对它嗤之以鼻！”","“Hallo!” cried Pencroft, “here is Neb turning up his nose at my gulf, just as I was thinking of presenting it to America!”"
"“不过，不管怎样，这里的水够深吗？”工程师问道，“对‘乘风破浪’号来说水够深了，对我们的装甲军舰却不一定够。”","“But, at any rate, is the water deep enough?” asked the engineer, “for a depth sufficient for the keel of the ‘Bonadventure’ would not be enough for those of our iron-clads.”"
"“这很容易证实。”潘克洛夫回答道。","“That is easily found out,” replied Pencroft."
"于是，水手用一根长绳绑上一块铁，作为铅垂线，进行测量。这根绳子长约50英寻，全放下去以后，还碰不到底。","And the sailor sounded with a long cord, which served him as a lead-line, and to which was fastened a lump of iron.This cord measured nearly fifty fathoms, and its entire length was unrolled without finding any bottom."
"“瞧，”潘克洛夫叫道，“我们的装甲舰可以来这里了！绝对不会搁浅的！”","“There,” exclaimed Pencroft, “our iron-clads can come here after all!They would not run aground!”"
"“的确，”吉丁·史佩莱说，“这个港湾是正常的深渊，不过，考虑到海岛是由于火山爆发而形成的，那么港湾的海底有如此深的凹陷也就不足为奇了。”","“Indeed,” said Gideon Spilett, “this gulf is a regular abyss, but, taking into consideration the volcanic origin of the island, it is not astonishing that the sea should offer similar depressions.”"
"“人们也会说，”赫伯特说，“这里的峭壁非常陡峭，我相信在峭壁脚下，即使潘克洛夫用比刚才的那一根长出五六倍的绳子去测量，也不会触到海底的。”","“One would say too,” observed Herbert, “that these cliffs were perfectly perpendicular; and I believe that at their foot, even with a line five or six times longer, Pencroft would not find bottom.”"
"“这都很好，”记者说道，“但是，我必须向潘克洛夫指出，这个港湾缺少一样非常重要的东西！”","“That is all very well,” then said the reporter, “but I must point out to Pencroft that his harbor is wanting in one very important respect!”"
"“什么东西，史佩莱先生？”","“And what is that, Mr. Spilett?”"
"“一个开口，一种通向海岛内部的豁口。我找不到一个可以登陆的地方。”确实，陡峭的熔岩峭壁没有一处地方适合登陆。峭壁形成一道难以逾越的屏障，使人想起挪威的峡湾，只是这里更显荒凉。“乘风破浪”号尽量靠近峭壁前行，但找不到一块突出的地方，可使乘客们离开甲板。","“An opening, a cutting of some sort, to give access to the interior of the island.I do not see a spot on which we could land.”And, in fact, the steep lava cliffs did not afford a single place suitable for landing.They formed an insuperable barrier, recalling, but with more wildness, the fiords of Norway.The “Bonadventure,” coasting as close as possible along the cliffs, did not discover even a projection which would allow the passengers to leave the deck."
"潘克洛夫自我安慰地说，如果需要，用炸药就可以在峭壁上炸出一个缺口，但是，这时候在港湾里，他显然也无计可施，于是把船驶向海峡，下午两点左右，他们穿出了港湾。","Pencroft consoled himself by saying that with the help of a mine they could soon open out the cliff when that was necessary, and then, as there was evidently nothing to be done in the gulf, he steered his vessel towards the strait and passed out at about two o’clock in the afternoon."
"“啊！”纳布满意地舒了一口气。","“Ah!” said Nab, uttering a sigh of satisfaction."
"在这条巨大的鲨鱼嘴里，这个老实的黑人真是感到不自在。","One might really say that the honest Negro did not feel at his ease in those enormous jaws."
"从颚骨角到慈悲河口不过八英里。“乘风破浪”号船头朝着花岗石宫，一阵顺风鼓起船帆，它就飞快地沿着海岸向前驶去。","The distance from Mandible Cape to the mouth of the Mercy was not more than eight miles.The head of the “Bonadventure” was put towards Granite House, and a fair wind filling her sails, she ran rapidly along the coast."
"驶过巨大的熔岩，不久就到了千姿百态的沙丘地带，工程师就是在这里莫名其妙地得救的，这一带常常有成千上万的海鸟飞来。","To the enormous lava rocks succeeded soon those capricious sand dunes, among which the engineer had been so singularly recovered, and which seabirds frequented in thousands."
"大约四点钟，潘克洛夫离开海岛左边的点，进入海岛与海岸之间的那条海峡，五点钟的时候，“乘风破浪”号就在慈悲河口的沙滩上抛锚了。","About four o’clock, Pencroft leaving the point of the islet on his left, entered the channel which separated it from the coast, and at five o’clock the anchor of the “Bonadventure” was buried in the sand at the mouth of the Mercy."
"开拓者们和他们的住处阔别了三天。艾尔顿在沙滩上等候他们，贾普也欢天喜地地跟来迎接，嘴里还发出满意的、低沉的呼噜声。","The colonists had been absent three days from their dwelling.Ayrton was waiting for them on the beach, and Jup came joyously to meet them, giving vent to deep grunts of satisfaction."
"现在岛上的海岸全都勘探过了，没有发现任何可疑的地方。如果有什么神秘的生物在这里居住，只可能隐藏在盘蛇半岛浓密的森林之中，居民们只有那里还没有搜查过。","A complete exploration of the coast of the island had now been made, and no suspicious appearances had been observed.If any mysterious being resided on it, it could only be under cover of the impenetrable forest of the Serpentine Peninsula, to which the colonists had not yet directed their investigations."
"吉丁·史佩莱和工程师讨论了这些事，决定让伙伴们注意岛上发生过的怪事，而最近发生的这件事最令人费解。","Gideon Spilett discussed these things with the engineer, and it was agreed that they should direct the attention of their companions to the strange character of certain incidents which had occurred on the island, and of which the last was the most unaccountable."
"不过，提到海岸上有不知名者点燃火堆的事情，哈丁禁不住又要问记者那个问了二十遍的问题：","However, Harding, returning to the fact of a fire having been kindled on the shore by an unknown hand, could not refrain from repeating for the twentieth time to the reporter,—"
"“你确信看到火光了吗？会不会是火山的局部喷发，或是什么流星呢？”","“But are you quite sure of having seen it?Was it not a partial eruption of the volcano, or perhaps some meteor?”"
"“不是，赛勒斯，”记者回答说，“千真万确是人点的火。不信你可以问潘克洛夫和赫伯特。他们和我都看到了，他们可以证实我说的话。”","“No, Cyrus,” answered the reporter, “it was certainly a fire lighted by the hand of man.Besides; question Pencroft and Herbert.They saw it as I saw it myself, and they will confirm my words.”"
"结果，又过了几天，4月25日晚上，当居民们都聚集在眺望岗上的时候，赛勒斯·哈丁开始跟大家说：","In consequence, therefore, a few days after, on the 25th of April, in the evening, when the settlers were all collected on Prospect Heights, Cyrus Harding began by saying,—"
"“朋友们，我认为我有责任让你们注意到岛上发生的一些事情，我将乐意听取你们对这些问题的看法。这些事情，说起来真是不可思议……”","“My friends, I think it my duty to call your attention to certain incidents which have occurred in the island, on the subject of which I shall be happy to have your advice.These incidents are, so to speak, supernatural—”"
"“不可思议！”水手吐了一口烟，大声说道，“难道我们的小岛会是不可思议的吗？”","“Supernatural!” exclaimed the sailor, emitting a volume of smoke from his mouth.“Can it be possible that our island is supernatural?”"
"“不，潘克洛夫，不过可以肯定，它是神秘的，”工程师回答道，“除非你能解释史佩莱和我至今还弄不明白的问题。”","“No, Pencroft, but mysterious, most certainly,” replied the engineer; “unless you can explain that which Spilett and I have until now failed to understand.”"
"“你说吧，上尉。”水手说。","“Speak away, captain,” answered the sailor."
"“那好，”于是工程师说道，“你知道我掉进大海以后，在岛上距离海边四分之一英里的地方被找到，而我对自己竟被移动了这件事毫无知觉，你们知道是什么原因吗？”","“Well, have you understood,” then said the engineer, “how was it that after falling into the sea, I was found a quarter of a mile into the interior of the island, and that, without my having any consciousness of my removal there?”"
"“除非你当时失去了知觉……”潘克洛夫说。","“Unless, being unconscious—” said Pencroft."
"“这是说不通的。”工程师说，“还有，我再问你，你说托普怎么会发现你们的住处呢？那离我躺着的山洞可是有五英里远！”","“That is not admissible,” replied the engineer.“But to continue.Have you understood how Top was able to discover your retreat five miles from the cave in which I was lying?”"
"“狗的本能……”赫伯特说。","“The dog’s instinct—” observed Herbert."
"“这种本能也太奇怪了！”记者接着说，“尽管那天夜里风雨肆虐，可托普来到石窟时，身上竟然是干的，而且没有一点污泥！”","“Singular instinct!” returned the reporter, “since notwithstanding the storm of rain and wind which was raging during that night, Top arrived at the Chimneys, dry and without a speck of mud!”"
"“我们接着说下去，”工程师又说，“你们说我们的狗在和儒艮搏斗后，怎么会被莫名奇妙地抛出湖面？”","“Let us continue,” resumed the engineer.“Have you understood how our dog was so strangely thrown up out of the water of the lake, after his struggle with the dugong?”"
"“不明白！我承认，一点也不明白，”潘克洛夫回答道，“还有儒艮身上的那个伤口，好像是被一种利器刺伤的，这件事也无法弄明白。”","“No!I confess, not at all,” replied Pencroft, “and the wound which the dugong had in its side, a wound which seemed to have been made with a sharp instrument; that can’t be understood, either.”"
"“我们接着说下去，”哈丁说，“朋友们，一颗子弹是怎么进入小野猪身体的；没有船只遇难的痕迹，怎么会有一只箱子恰巧幸运地搁浅在沙滩上；我们第一次在海上航行时，怎么会那么巧出现那只装着纸条的瓶子；为什么在缆绳断了之后，我们的小船会在我们需要的时候，顺着慈悲河水向下流，漂到我们身边来；为什么猿猴入侵后，绳梯会那么及时地从花岗石宫上面放下来；最后，为什么艾尔顿一口咬定从没写过的纸条会落入我们手中？”","“Let us continue again,” said Harding.“Have you understood, my friends, how that bullet got into the body of the young peccary; how that case happened to be so fortunately stranded, without there being any trace of a wreck; how that bottle containing the document presented itself so opportunely, during our first sea-excursion; how our canoe, having broken its moorings, floated down the current of the Mercy and rejoined us at the very moment we needed it; how after the ape invasion the ladder was so obligingly thrown down from Granite House; and lastly, how the document, which Ayrton asserts was never written by him, fell into our hands?”"
"赛勒斯·哈丁一件不漏地把岛上发生过的怪事一一列举出来，赫伯特、纳布和潘克洛夫都面面相觑，无言以对，因为这一连串的事件第一次被集中起来，这确实使他们惊讶到了极点。","As Cyrus Harding thus enumerated, without forgetting one, the singular incidents which had occurred in the island, Herbert, Neb, and Pencroft stared at each other, not knowing what to reply, for this succession of incidents, grouped thus for the first time, could not but excite their surprise to the highest degree."
"“我敢赌咒发誓，”潘克洛夫说，“上尉，你说得对，所有这些事都难以解释！”","“‘Pon my word,” said Pencroft at last, “you are right, captain, and it is difficult to explain all these things!”"
"“好吧，朋友们，”工程师又说，“最近又添了一件事情，和以前那些事一样离奇！”","“Well, my friends,” resumed the engineer, “a last fact has just been added to these, and it is no less incomprehensible than the others!”"
"“什么事，上尉？”赫伯特马上问道。","“What is it, captain?” asked Herbert quickly."
"“潘克洛夫，你们从达抱岛回来的时候，”工程师接着说，“你说过林肯岛上出现过火光，是这样吗？”","“When you were returning from Tabor Island, Pencroft,” continued the engineer, “you said that a fire appeared on Lincoln Island?”"
"“确实如此。”水手答道。","“Certainly,” answered the sailor."
"“你肯定看见那堆火了吗？”","“And you are quite certain of having seen this fire?”"
"“就像我现在看见你一样肯定。”","“As sure as I see you now.”"
"“赫伯特，你也看见了吗？”","“You also, Herbert?”"
"“怎么了，上尉，”赫伯特叫道，“那火光就像一等星那样灿烂夺目！”","“Why, captain,” cried Herbert, “that fire was blazing like a star of the first magnitude!”"
"“会不会是一颗星呢？”工程师追问道。","“But was it not a star?” urged the engineer."
"“不是，”潘克洛夫回答说，“当时天上布满了厚厚的云层，而且不管怎么说，星星不可能那么靠近地平线。史佩莱先生和我们一样也看见了，他可以证实我们的话。”","“No,” replied Pencroft, “for the sky was covered with thick clouds, and at any rate a star would not have been so low on the horizon.But Mr. Spilett saw it as well as we, and he will confirm our words.”"
"“我再补充一句，”记者说，“那火光非常亮，如同射出一道闪电。”","“I will add,” said the reporter, “that the fire was very bright, and that it shot up like a sheet of lightning.”"
"“是的，是的！一点也不错，”赫伯特说道，“火堆的位置肯定是在花岗石宫的高岗上。”","“Yes, yes! exactly,” added Herbert, “and it was certainly placed on the heights of Granite House.”"
"“好吧，朋友们，”赛勒斯·哈丁说，“10月19日那天夜里，纳布和我都没有在海岸上点过火。”","“Well, my friends,” replied Cyrus Harding, “during the night of the 19th of October, neither Neb nor I lighted any fire on the coast.”"
"“你没有点过火！”潘克洛夫极度惊讶，连话也说不下去了。","“You did not!” exclaimed Pencroft, in the height of his astonishment, not being able to finish his sentence."
"“我们没有离开过花岗石宫，”赛勒斯·哈丁回答说，“如果海岸有火光出现，那一定是别人点的，而不是我们！”","“We did not leave Granite House,” answered Cyrus Harding, “and if a fire appeared on the coast, it was lighted by another hand than ours!”"
"潘克洛夫、赫伯特和纳布全都惊呆了。这不可能是幻觉，10月19日夜里，他们确实亲眼目睹了火光。是的，他们不得不承认其中有神秘之处！有一股无法解释的力量——显然对开拓者们有利，会及时地在林肯岛上出发挥作用，这极大地激起了他们的好奇心。会不会有什么东西藏在最隐蔽的地方呢？必须不惜一切代价证实这一点。","Pencroft, Herbert, and Neb were stupefied.No illusion could be possible, and a fire had actually met their eyes during the night of the 19th of October.Yes! they had to acknowledge it, a mystery existed!An inexplicable influence, evidently favorable to the colonists, but very irritating to their curiosity, was executed always in the nick of time on Lincoln Island.Could there be some being hidden in its profoundest recesses?It was necessary at any cost to ascertain this."
"哈丁还提醒同伴们注意，当托普和贾普在花岗石宫那口与大海相通的井口旁徘徊时，就表现怪异，他还告诉大家，自己曾下井搜索过，但没有发现什么可疑的东西。最后，由于这次谈话，他们作出决定，一旦天气再次转好，开拓地全体成员就去全面搜索整个海岛。","Harding also reminded his companions of the singular behavior of Top and Jup when they prowled round the mouth of the well, which placed Granite House in communication with the sea, and he told them that he had explored the well, without discovering anything suspicious.The final resolve taken, in consequence of this conversation, by all the members of the colony, was that as soon as the fine season returned they would thoroughly search the whole of the island."
"可是，自从这一天起，潘克洛夫就显得忧心忡忡。他似乎感觉，这个他原来当成私有财产的海岛现在不完全属于自己了，他要和另一个主人共有，并且不管愿不愿意，他觉得自己受到此人的支配。纳布和他经常谈论起这些无法解释的事情，由于他们两人生性喜欢神奇古怪之事，所以不免相信有某种超自然的力量在统治着林肯岛。","But from that day Pencroft appeared to be anxious.He felt as if the island which he had made his own personal property belonged to him entirely no longer, and that he shared it with another master, to whom, willing or not, he felt subject.Neb and he often talked of those unaccountable things, and both, their natures inclining them to the marvelous, were not far from believing that Lincoln Island was under the dominion of some supernatural power."
"此时，随着五月的到来，也就是相当于北半球的十一月，坏天气也来了。今年的冬天看起来会提前，而且会很冷。因此，过冬的准备工作刻不容缓地进行了起来。","In the meanwhile, the bad weather came with the month of May, the November of the northern zones.It appeared that the winter would be severe and forward.The preparations for the winter season were therefore commenced without delay."
"但是，不管这个冬天多么严酷，开拓者们还是作了很好的准备过冬。他们有大量的毛毡衣服，到时候，会有大量的摩弗仑羊，可以提供制作这种保暖织物所必需的充足羊毛。","Nevertheless, the colonists were well prepared to meet the winter, however hard it might be.They had plenty of felt clothing, and the musmons, very numerous by this time, had furnished an abundance of wool necessary for the manufacture of this warm material."
"不用说，大家也给艾尔顿准备了这种舒适的衣服。赛勒斯·哈丁建议，他到花岗岩石宫和大家一起度过糟糕的季节，在这里住会比在畜栏里好些，艾尔顿答应等畜栏的最后一些工作结束后，就立刻搬过来。四月中旬，他搬过来了。自那以后，艾尔顿就过起了集体生活，并且在各种场合都发挥了作用，不过他还是一副谦恭、忧郁的样子，从不参与到同伴的欢乐中。","It is unnecessary to say that Ayrton had been provided with this comfortable clothing.Cyrus Harding proposed that he should come to spend the bad season with them in Granite House, where he would be better lodged than at the corral, and Ayrton promised to do so, as soon as the last work at the corral was finished.He did this towards the middle of April.From that time Ayrton shared the common life, and made himself useful on all occasions; but still humble and sad, he never took part in the pleasures of his companions."
"居民们在林肯岛上的第三个冬天，大部分都是在花岗石宫内度过的。有过好几次猛烈而可怕的狂风暴雨，似乎都要震动他们的基石了。滔天巨浪险些要盖过整个海岛，毫无疑问，只要是停泊在海岸边的船只，一定会被撞个粉碎。在这样的风暴里，上涨的慈悲河水有两次差点把桥梁冲垮，每当海水冲击海滩时，堤岸上的桥都淹没在冒着白沫的水浪中，因此必须加固桥身。","For the greater part of this, the third winter which the settlers passed in Lincoln Island, they were confined to Granite House.There were many violent storms and frightful tempests, which appeared to shake the rocks to their very foundations.Immense waves threatened to overwhelm the island, and certainly any vessel anchored near the shore would have been dashed to pieces.Twice, during one of these hurricanes, the Mercy swelled to such a degree as to give reason to fear that the bridges would be swept away, and it was necessary to strengthen those on the shore, which disappeared under the foaming waters, when the sea beat against the beach."
"大家都认为，这种暴风雨，比得上夹着雨雪的龙卷风，一定会对眺望岗的高地造成巨大的损失。特别是磨坊和家禽养殖场，也会遭受严重损失。开拓者们不得不经常去做一些抢修工作，否则家禽的安全会面临极大的威胁。","It may well be supposed that such storms, comparable to water-spouts in which were mingled rain and snow, would cause great havoc on the plateau of Prospect Heights.The mill and the poultry-yard particularly suffered.The colonists were often obliged to make immediate repairs, without which the safety of the birds would have been seriously threatened."
"在天气最恶劣的时候，有几只美洲豹和成群结队的猿猴闯到高地的边缘，大家很担心，这些灵活胆大的动物会为饥饿所驱使，利用河水冰封提供的便捷通道走过来。如果没有人经常守护，农作物和家畜难免要遭殃，而且还必须常常开枪，让这些危险的来访者不敢靠近。所以这个冬天，开拓者们要干的活很多，不算户外的工作，在花岗石宫内的整理工作常常就非常多。","During the worst weather, several jaguars and troops of quadrumana ventured to the edge of the plateau, and it was always to be feared that the most active and audacious would, urged by hunger, manage to cross the stream, which besides, when frozen, offered them an easy passage.Plantations and domestic animals would then have been infallibly destroyed, without a constant watch, and it was often necessary to make use of the guns to keep those dangerous visitors at a respectful distance.Occupation was not wanting to the colonists, for without reckoning their out-door cares, they had always a thousand plans for the fitting up of Granite House."
"碰上下霜的日子，他们也去广阔的漆凫沼泽打了几次猎。这里有无数的野鸭、鹬、短颈野鸭和其他水禽，吉丁·史佩莱和赫伯特在托普和贾普的协助下，百发百中。猎人们到这一带猎场去很容易，不管是跨过慈悲河桥，通过气球港的那条路到那里，还是从遗物角绕过峭壁，猎人们离花岗石宫都不会超过两三英里的距离。","They had also some fine sporting excursions, which were made during the frost in the vast Tadorn Marsh.Gideon Spilett and Herbert, aided by Jup and Top, did not miss a shot in the midst of myriads of wild-duck, snipe, teal, and others.The access to these hunting-grounds was easy; besides, whether they reached them by the road to Port Balloon, after having passed the Mercy Bridge, or by turning the rocks from Flotsam Point, the hunters were never distant from Granite House more than two or three miles."
"冬季着实严寒的四个月，也就是六、七、八、九月，就这样度过了。不过，总而言之，花岗石宫并未受到酷寒天气太大的影响。畜栏也是如此，由于它不像高地那样暴露在外，部分又受到富兰克林山的遮蔽，风暴被森林和海岸上高大的岩壁遮挡后，到达这里时已经很微弱了。因此，畜栏的损失很小，10月期间，艾尔顿回去了几天，凭着他勤快利落的双手，很快就完成了修缮工作。","Thus passed the four winter months, which were really rigorous, that is to say, June, July, August, and September.But, in short, Granite House did not suffer much from the inclemency of the weather, and it was the same with the corral, which, less exposed than the plateau, and sheltered partly by Mount Franklin, only received the remains of the hurricanes, already broken by the forests and the high rocks of the shore.The damages there were consequently of small importance, and the activity and skill of Ayrton promptly repaired them, when some time in October he returned to pass a few days in the corral."
"这个冬天并没有发生什么新的怪事。虽然潘克洛夫和纳布密切注意着最微不足道的事情，他们也把这些事情和神秘的原因联系起来，然而还是没有发生任何怪诞的事情。托普和贾普也不再在井口边嗥叫，也没有任何不安的表现。因此，这一系列神奇的事件似乎中断了，不过晚上在花岗石宫里，大家还是经常谈论起这些事，而且还是决定要彻底搜查全岛，甚至是那些最难以搜索的部分也不放过。但此时，发生了一件最重大的事情，使得赛勒斯·哈丁和伙伴们暂时改变了计划，此事也许会产生可怕的后果。","During this winter, no fresh inexplicable incident occurred.Nothing strange happened, although Pencroft and Neb were on the watch for the most insignificant facts to which they attached any mysterious cause.Top and Jup themselves no longer growled round the well or gave any signs of uneasiness.It appeared, therefore, as if the series of supernatural incidents was interrupted, although they often talked of them during the evenings in Granite House, and they remained thoroughly resolved that the island should be searched, even in those parts the most difficult to explore.But an event of the highest importance, and of which the consequences might be terrible, momentarily diverted from their projects Cyrus Harding and his companions."
"时间是十月份。美好的季节转眼间已来临。大自然在复苏，森林边缘那些常绿的针叶树中，山龙眼、喜马拉雅杉和其他一些树已经抽出了新绿。","It was the month of October.The fine season was swiftly returning.Nature was reviving; and among the evergreen foliage of the coniferae which formed the border of the wood, already appeared the young leaves of the banksias, deodars, and other trees."
"大家也许还记得，吉丁·史佩莱和赫伯特已经多次拍摄林肯岛的风景照。","It may be remembered that Gideon Spilett and Herbert had, at different times, taken photographic views of Lincoln Island."
"10月17日下午，将近三点的时候，赫伯特被天空的魅力吸引着，他想拍一张眺望岗对面联合湾的照片，范围从颚骨角一直到爪角。","Now, on the 17th of this month of October, towards three o’clock in the afternoon, Herbert, enticed by the charms of the sky, thought of reproducing Union Bay, which was opposite to Prospect Heights, from Cape Mandible to Claw Cape."
"地平线非常清晰，大海像湖面一样平静，轻柔的微风吹过，泛起小小的涟漪，阳光照射下，到处闪烁着银光。","The horizon was beautifully clear, and the sea, undulating under a soft breeze, was as calm as the waters of a lake, sparkling here and there under the sun’s rays."
"照相机放置在花岗石宫餐厅的一个窗台上，因此能俯瞰海岸和整个海湾。赫伯特像往常一样操作，底片感光以后，他就去室内的一个阴暗角落，用存放在那里的化学物将它固定。","The apparatus had been placed at one of the windows of the dining-room at Granite House, and consequently overlooked the shore and the bay.Herbert proceeded as he was accustomed to do, and the negative obtained, he went away to fix it by means of the chemicals deposited in a dark nook of Granite House."
"赫伯特回到亮处，仔细检查底片，发现底片的海平线上，有一个几乎难以察觉的小黑点。他反复地洗，想把这一小点东西除去，可是洗不掉。","Returning to the bright light, and examining it well, Herbert perceived on his negative an almost imperceptible little spot on the sea horizon.He endeavored to make it disappear by reiterated washing, but could not accomplish it."
"“这是镜头上的一个污点。”他这样想。","“It is a flaw in the glass,” he thought."
"可是由于好奇心的驱使，他从望远镜上取下一个倍数很大的透镜，打算仔细察看这个小黑点。","And then he had the curiosity to examine this flaw with a strong magnifier which he unscrewed from one of the telescopes."
"不过，他刚刚看了一眼就大叫起来，透镜险些从手中掉了下去。","But he had scarcely looked at it, when he uttered a cry, and the glass almost fell from his hands."
"赫伯特立即跑到赛勒斯·哈丁的房里，把底片和放大镜递给工程师，并把底片上的小黑点指给他看。","Immediately running to the room in which Cyrus Harding then was, he extended the negative and magnifier towards the engineer, pointing out the little spot."
"哈丁细看了一下，然后抓起望远镜，冲向窗口。","Harding examined it; then seizing his telescope he rushed to the window."
"望远镜慢慢扫过水平线，最后停在要找的那一点上，赛勒斯·哈丁放下望远镜，只说了一个字：","The telescope, after having slowly swept the horizon, at last stopped on the looked-for spot, and Cyrus Harding, lowering it, pronounced one word only,—"
"“船！”","“A vessel!”"
"事实上，有一只船在视线之内，在离林肯岛不远的地方！","And in fact a vessel was in sight, off Lincoln Island!"
"第三部 海岛的秘密","Part 3—The Secret of the Island"
"第一章","Chapter 1"
"这群遇难者从气球上被抛到林肯岛已经两年半了，在这期间，他们和外界没有取得任何联系。有一次，记者将写有他们境遇的一封密信系在一只鸟的身上，试图以此与有人居住的外界取得联系，可这要碰运气，不能对它抱很大的希望。艾尔顿独自一人加入到移民小队中，当时的情况前面已经提到过了。然而，10月17日这天，在这杳无人迹的海面上，却有另一伙人出乎意料地出现在岛上移民的视线范围内。","It was now two years and a half since the castaways from the balloon had been thrown on Lincoln Island, and during that period there had been no communication between them and their fellow-creatures.Once the reporter had attempted to communicate with the inhabited world by confiding to a bird a letter which contained the secret of their situation, but that was a chance on which it was impossible to reckon seriously.Ayrton, alone, under the circumstances which have been related, had come to join the little colony.Now, suddenly, on this day, the 17th of October, other men had unexpectedly appeared in sight of the island, on that deserted sea!"
"这一点毫无疑问！那里有一艘船！不过它是继续前进，还是要靠岸呢？几个小时之后，移民们一定就可以知道答案了。","There could be no doubt about it!A vessel was there!But would she pass on, or would she put into port?In a few hours the colonists would definitely know what to expect."
"赛勒斯·哈丁和赫伯特立刻把吉迪恩·史佩莱、潘克洛夫和纳布叫到了花岗石宫的餐厅，并把发生的事情告诉了他们。潘克洛夫抓起望远镜，迅速扫视了一下地平线，然后把目光停留在他们所指的那一点上，也就是照片底片上那个几乎看不见的小点。","Cyrus Harding and Herbert having immediately called Gideon Spilett, Pencroft, and Neb into the dining-room of Granite House, told them what had happened.Pencroft, seizing the telescope, rapidly swept the horizon, and stopping on the indicated point, that is to say, on that which had made the almost imperceptible spot on the photographic negative,—"
"“见鬼！真是一艘船！”他喊道，说话的语气显得并不十分满意。","“I’m blessed but it is really a vessel!” he exclaimed, in a voice which did not express any great amount of satisfaction."
"“它要开向我们这里吗？”吉迪恩·史佩莱问道。","“Is she coming here?” asked Gideon Spilett."
"“现在还很难说，”潘克洛夫回答，“因为海平面上只露出桅杆，根本看不见船身。”","“Impossible to say anything yet,” answered Pencroft, “for her rigging alone is above the horizon, and not a bit of her hull can be seen.”"
"“该怎么办呢？”少年问。","“What is to be done?” asked the lad."
"“等等看。”哈丁回答说。","“Wait,” replied Harding."
"在很长一段时间里，岛上的移民们都沉默不语，他们沉浸在由此事所引起的各种思想、情感、恐惧和希望中，这是他们来到林肯岛以后发生的最重要的事件。当然，这些移民们的情况与那些被抛弃在孤岛上的遇难者不一样，后者为了能艰难地生存下去，经常要同残酷的大自然作斗争，因为想要回归家园的渴望而饱受折磨。尤其是潘克洛夫和纳布，他们立即感到既快乐、又富有，如果真的要离开孤岛，他们一定会深感遗憾。再说，他们已经习惯了这种新的生活，并且依靠自己的智慧，给这片土地带来了文明。但无论如何，这艘船带来了来自大陆的消息，甚至有可能来自他们的祖国。它将要给他们带来同伴，因此，可以想象，在他们看见船的时候，内心该是多么激动啊！","And for a considerable time the settlers remained silent, given up to all the thoughts, and the emotions, all the fears, all the hopes, which were aroused by this incident—the most important which had occurred since their arrival in Lincoln Island.Certainly, the colonists were not in the situation of castaways abandoned on a sterile islet, constantly contending against a cruel nature for their miserable existence, and incessantly tormented by the longing to return to inhabited countries.Pencroft and Neb, especially, who felt themselves at once so happy and so rich, would not have left their island without regret.They were accustomed, besides, to this new life in the midst of the domain which their intelligence had as it were civilized.But at any rate this ship brought news from the world, perhaps even from their native land.It was bringing fellow-creatures to them, and it may be conceived how deeply their hearts were moved at the sight!"
"潘克洛夫不时拿起望远镜，靠在窗口。他从那儿仔细地观察着那艘船，船在东面20海里的地方。移民们还没有办法发信号。无论是升旗、开枪还是点燃火把，船上的人都看不见也听不着。不过，可以肯定的是，孤岛上高耸的富兰克林山一定逃不过船上眺望哨的视线。可是，这艘船为什么要到这儿来呢？难道只是偶然来到这里的吗？在地图上，除了达抱岛以外，太平洋的这个地区没有任何其他陆地，而达抱岛本身也不在往来于波利尼西亚群岛、新西兰和美国海岸之间船只的航线上。每个人都在这样问自己，赫伯特突然做出回答。","From time to time Pencroft took the glass and rested himself at the window.From thence he very attentively examined the vessel, which was at a distance of twenty miles to the east.The colonists had as yet, therefore, no means of signalizing their presence.A flag would not have been perceived; a gun would not have been heard; a fire would not have been visible.However, it was certain that the island, overtopped by Mount Franklin, could not escape the notice of the vessel’s lookout.But why was the ship coming there?Was it simple chance which brought it to that part of the Pacific, where the maps mentioned no land except Tabor Island, which itself was out of the route usually followed by vessels from the Polynesian Archipelagoes, from New Zealand, and from the American coast?To this question, which each one asked himself, a reply was suddenly made by Herbert."
"“该不会是‘邓肯’号吧？”他大声说。","“Can it be the ‘Duncan’?” he cried."
"前面已经说过，“邓肯”号是格里那凡爵士的游船，曾把艾尔顿遗弃在小岛上，日后还会回来把他接回去。达抱岛和林肯岛相隔并不很远，因此，在林肯岛上可以看见驶向达抱岛的船只。（两者之间的经线距离只有150英里，纬线距离则只有70英里。）","The “Duncan,” as has been said, was Lord Glenarvan’s yacht, which had left Ayrton on the islet, and which was to return there someday to fetch him.Now, the islet was not so far distant from Lincoln Island, but that a vessel, standing for the one, could pass in sight of the other.A hundred and fifty miles only separated them in longitude, and seventy in latitude."
"“我们必须通知艾尔顿，”吉迪恩·史佩莱说，“立刻把他喊来。只有他才能认出那只船是不是‘邓肯’号。”","“We must tell Ayrton,” said Gideon Spilett, “and send for him immediately.He alone can say if it is the ‘Duncan.’”"
"大家一致同意，于是记者走到联系畜栏和花岗石宫的电报机旁，发了一份电报：“速来。”","This was the opinion of all, and the reporter, going to the telegraphic apparatus which placed the corral in communication with Granite House, sent this telegram:—“Come with all possible speed.”"
"几分钟后，铃响了。","In a few minutes the bell sounded."
"艾尔顿回答：“我就来。”","“I am coming,” replied Ayrton."
"接着，移民们继续观察那艘船。","Then the settlers continued to watch the vessel."
"“如果它是‘邓肯’号，”赫伯特说，“艾尔顿肯定能轻而易举地认出来，因为他在这艘船上呆过一段时间。”","“If it is the ‘Duncan,’” said Herbert, “Ayrton will recognize her without difficulty, since he sailed on board her for some time.”"
"“如果艾尔顿真的认出了它，”潘克洛夫补充道，“一定会激动万分！”","“And if he recognizes her,” added Pencroft, “it will agitate him exceedingly!”"
"“是的，”赛勒斯·哈丁回答说，“现在艾尔顿已经有资格回到‘邓肯’号上去了，老天保佑它真的是格里那凡爵士的游船，否则除此之外的任何船只都令我怀疑。这一带海面上经常有坏人出没，我总担心会有来自马来的海盗光顾我们的小岛，”","“Yes,” answered Cyrus Harding; “but now Ayrton is worthy to return on board the ‘Duncan,’ and pray Heaven that it is indeed Lord Glenarvan’s yacht, for I should be suspicious of any other vessel.These are ill-famed seas, and I have always feared a visit from Malay pirates to our island.”"
"“我们可以保卫小岛。”赫伯特叫道。","“We could defend it,’, cried Herbert."
"“那当然，孩子，”工程师微笑着说，“不过要是用不着保卫，那就更好了。”","“No doubt, my boy,” answered the engineer smiling, “but it would be better not to have to defend it.”"
"“这种想法是没有必要的，”史佩莱说，“既然连最新的地图上都没有标出林肯岛，那么航海者们一定不知道它的存在。要是一艘船突然发现了新陆地，肯定会有充分的理由试着去勘探一番，而不会避开它离去，你说是不是，赛勒斯？”","“A useless observation,” said Spilett.“Lincoln Island is unknown to navigators, since it is not marked even on the most recent maps.Do you think, Cyrus, that that is a sufficient motive for a ship, finding herself unexpectedly in sight of new land, to try and visit rather than avoid it?”"
"“当然。”潘克洛夫回答。","“Certainly,” replied Pencroft."
"“我也这么认为，”工程师补充说，“甚至可以这样说：任何一位船长都有责任勘察所有尚未被发现的陆地或岛屿，而林肯岛正属于这种情况。”","“I think so too,” added the engineer.“It may even be said that it is the duty of a captain to come and survey any land or island not yet known, and Lincoln Island is in this position.”"
"“那么，”潘克洛夫说，“如果这艘船来了，并且就在离我们岛几链远的地方下锚，我们该怎么办？”","“Well,” said Pencroft, “suppose this vessel comes and anchors there a few cables-lengths from our island, what shall we do?”"
"这个突如其来的问题一时无人作答。不过，赛勒斯·哈丁考虑了一会之后，便和往常一样，用平静的语气答道：","This sudden question remained at first without any reply.But Cyrus Harding, after some moments’ thought, replied in the calm tone which was usual to him,—"
"“朋友们，怎么办？应该这么办：我们要和船上的人取得联系，然后乘着它离开这座我们以美国的名义占有的岛屿。将来，我们要和那些愿意跟随我们的人回来，正式对它进行开发，为美利坚合众国在太平洋的这个地区奉献一个有用的基地！”","“What we shall do, my friends?What we ought to do is this:—we will communicate with the ship, we will take our passage on board her, and we will leave our island, after having taken possession of it in the name of the United States.Then we will return with any who may wish to follow us to colonize it definitely, and endow the American Republic with a useful station in this part of the Pacific Ocean!”"
"“哇！”潘克洛夫叫道，“我们送给祖国的这份礼物可不小啊！对小岛的开发已经接近完工，岛上的每一部分都命了名，这里有天然港口、淡水、道路、电报设备、船坞和一些制造厂，只差把林肯岛标在地图上了！”","“Hurrah!” exclaimed Pencroft, “and that will be no small present which we shall make to our country!The colonization is already almost finished; names are given to every part of the island; there is a natural port, fresh water, roads, a telegraph, a dockyard, and manufactories; and there will be nothing to be done but to inscribe Lincoln Island on the maps!”"
"“可是，如果有人趁我们不在的时候占领了它怎么办？”吉迪恩·史佩莱说。","“But if anyone seizes it in our absence?” observed Gideon Spilett."
"“该死！”水手喊道，“我宁可一个人留下来保卫它，　相信我潘克洛夫吧，我是不会让他们就像从鼓起来的口袋中偷取手表一样，从我手中抢走小岛的。”","“Hang it!” cried the sailor.“I would rather remain all alone to guard it: and trust to Pencroft, they shouldn’t steal it from him, like a watch from the pocket of a swell!”"
"整整一个小时，大家还无法确定这艘船会不会朝林肯岛驶来。它近了点，但究竟是沿着什么方向航行的呢？这一点潘克洛夫也不能断定。不过，由于这时刮的是东北风，这艘船很可能是右舷抢风行驶。此外，向林肯岛开来恰巧是顺风，海面上又是风平浪静，所以尽管地图上没有标出浅滩的位置，它仍可以放心大胆地开过来。","For an hour it was impossible to say with any certainty whether the vessel was or was not standing towards Lincoln Island.She was nearer, but in what direction was she sailing?This Pencroft could not determine.However, as the wind was blowing from the northeast, in all probability the vessel was sailing on the starboard tack.Besides, the wind was favorable for bringing her towards the island, and, the sea being calm, she would not be afraid to approach although the shallows were not marked on the chart."
"四点左右——也就是接到邀请后的一个小时——艾尔顿来到了花岗石宫。他走进餐厅，说：","Towards four o’clock—an hour after he had been sent for—Ayrton arrived at Granite House.He entered the dining-room saying,—"
"“有什么吩咐，先生们？”","“At your service, gentlemen.”"
"赛勒斯·哈丁照例向他伸出手来，把他领到窗口。","Cyrus Harding gave him his hand, as was his custom to do, and, leading him to the window,—"
"“艾尔顿，”他说，“我们请你到这来有一件重要的事情。岛的附近有一艘船。”","“Ayrton,” said he, “we have begged you to come here for an important reason.A ship is in sight of the island.”"
"起初艾尔顿的脸色略微一变，不一会儿，眼神暗淡下来，接着，他把身体探出窗外，扫视了一下水平线，可什么也没看见。","Ayrton at first paled slightly, and for a moment his eyes became dim; then, leaning out the window, he surveyed the horizon, but could see nothing."
"“用望远镜仔细看一看吧，”史佩莱说，“艾尔顿，也许是‘邓肯’号为了接你回家再次来到这片海域。”","“Take this telescope,” said Spilett, “and look carefully, Ayrton, for it is possible that this ship may be the ‘Duncan’ come to these seas for the purpose of taking you home again.”"
"“‘邓肯’号！”艾尔顿喃喃地说，“来了吗？”他不由自主地说完最后这句话，然后双手抱头。","“The ‘Duncan!’” murmured Ayrton.“Already?”This last word escaped Ayrton’s lips as if involuntarily, and his head drooped upon his hands."
"难道他认为在荒岛上独居了12年还不足以弥补自己的罪过吗？不论在他自己还是别人的眼里，这位悔过的罪人，难道还不觉得已经得到宽恕了吗？","Did not twelve years’ solitude on a desert island appear to him a sufficient expiation?Did not the penitent yet feel himself pardoned, either in his own eyes or in the eyes of others?"
"“不，”他说，“不！不会是‘邓肯’号！”","“No,” said he, “no! it cannot be the ‘Duncan’!”"
"“再看看，艾尔顿，”工程师说，“我们必须事先知道将会发生什么事。”","“Look, Ayrton,” then said the engineer, “for it is necessary that we should know beforehand what to expect.”"
"艾尔顿拿起望远镜，朝大家所指的方向看去。他一动不动，默不作声地对着地平线看了好几分钟，然后说：","Ayrton took the glass and pointed it in the direction indicated.During some minutes he examined the horizon without moving, without uttering a word.Then,—"
"“确实是一艘船，但我认为它不是‘邓肯’号。”","“It is indeed a vessel,” said he, “but I do not think she is the ‘Duncan.’”"
"“为什么你认为不是呢？”吉迪恩·史佩莱问道。","“Why do you not think so?” asked Gideon Spilett."
"“因为‘邓肯’号是一艘蒸汽游船，而我在这艘船的上方和四周却连一点烟都看不见。”","“Because the ‘Duncan’ is a steam-yacht, and I cannot perceive any trace of smoke either above or near that vessel.”"
"“也许它正张着帆在航行，”潘克洛夫说，“它现在的方向恰巧是顺风，离陆地这么远，它或许迫切想节省一点煤。”","“Perhaps she is simply sailing,” observed Pencroft.“The wind is favorable for the direction which she appears to be taking, and she may be anxious to economize her coal, being so far from land.”"
"“也许你说得对，潘克洛夫先生，”艾尔顿回答说，“这艘船可能把火熄了。我们只能等它驶近一点，到时候就可以知道将要发生什么了。”","“It is possible that you may be right, Mr. Pencroft,” answered Ayrton, “and that the vessel has extinguished her fires.We must wait until she is nearer, and then we shall soon know what to expect.”"
"说完，艾尔顿就在房间的一个角落里坐了下来，保持沉默。移民们又谈起这艘陌生的船，但艾尔顿没有参与谈话。大家都已经没有心思继续工作。吉迪恩·史佩莱和潘克洛夫显得尤为紧张，他俩走来走去，一刻也坐不住。赫伯特则感到好奇。只有纳布和往常一样保持着镇定。他的祖国难道不是他的主人所在地方吗？至于工程师，他陷入了沉思，在他心里，与其说是盼望这艘船来，还不如说是害怕它来。这时候，船离岛又近了些。从望远镜里，他们可以看清这是一艘双桅船，而不是太平洋海盗们常用的那种马来帆船。所以，人们有理由相信工程师的担心看来是多余的，这艘船在海岛附近出现并不会为他们带来值得担心的危险。","So saying, Ayrton sat down in a corner of the room and remained silent.The colonists again discussed the strange ship, but Ayrton took no part in the conversation.All were in such a mood that they found it impossible to continue their work.Gideon Spilett and Pencroft were particularly nervous, going, coming, not able to remain still in one place.Herbert felt more curiosity.Neb alone maintained his usual calm manner.Was not his country that where his master was?As to the engineer, he remained plunged in deep thought, and in his heart feared rather than desired the arrival of the ship.In the meanwhile, the vessel was a little nearer the island.With the aid of the glass, it was ascertained that she was a brig, and not one of those Malay proas, which are generally used by the pirates of the Pacific.It was, therefore, reasonable to believe that the engineer’s apprehensions would not be justified, and that the presence of this vessel in the vicinity of the island was fraught with no danger."
"潘克洛夫经过一番仔细检查，确定这是一艘双桅船，它正借助右舷风，鼓足所有的风帆，对着海岸斜驶过来。艾尔顿也证实了这一点。可是，照这样的方向行驶，双桅船很快就会消失在爪角后面，因为现在刮的是西南风，要对它进行观察，就必须登上气球港附近华盛顿湾的高地。而让人生气的是，这时已是傍晚五点钟，苍茫的暮色很快就会使观察变得异常艰难。","Pencroft, after a minute examination, was able positively to affirm that the vessel was rigged as a brig, and that she was standing obliquely towards the coast, on the starboard tack, under her topsails and top-gallant-sails.This was confirmed by Ayrton.But by continuing in this direction she must soon disappear behind Claw Cape, as the wind was from the southwest, and to watch her it would be then necessary to ascend the height of Washington Bay, near Port Balloon—a provoking circumstance, for it was already five o’clock in the evening, and the twilight would soon make any observation extremely difficult."
"“天黑了我们该怎么办？”吉迪恩·史佩莱问道。“要不要点起一堆火，好让他们知道在海岸这我们的存在？”","“What shall we do when night comes on?” asked Gideon Spilett.“Shall we light a fire, so as to signal our presence on the coast?”"
"这个问题事关重大，尽管工程师心里还有一种不祥的预感，但还是同意这么做。在夜间，这艘船也许会消失，会一去不复返，一旦它走了，还会有其他船只再到林肯岛附近来吗？谁能预见移民们的未来呢？","This was a serious question, and yet, although the engineer still retained some of his presentiments, it was answered in the affirmative.During the night the ship might disappear and leave for ever, and, this ship gone, would another ever return to the waters of Lincoln Island?Who could foresee what the future would then have in store for the colonists?"
"“不错，”记者说，“不管它是什么船，我们都要让船上的人知道岛上有人居住。要是错过这个送上门来的机会，也许会造成永久的后悔。”","“Yes,” said the reporter, “we ought to make known to that vessel, whoever she may be, that the island is inhabited.To neglect the opportunity which is offered to us might be to create everlasting regrets.”"
"于是大家决定让纳布和潘克洛夫去气球港，等天黑后，就在那里点燃一大堆火，火光一定会引起双桅船的注意。","It was therefore decided that Neb and Pencroft should go to Port Balloon, and that there, at nightfall, they should light an immense fire, the blaze of which would necessarily attract the attention of the brig."
"可是，正当纳布和水手准备离开花岗石宫的时候，那艘船改变了方向，径直朝联合湾驶来。这是一艘好船，很快就靠近了海岸。于是，纳布和潘克洛夫暂时留了下来，大家把望远镜交给艾尔顿，让他最后确认这艘船到底是不是“邓肯”号。苏格兰游船——“邓肯”号也是一艘双桅船。现在，船离海岛只有五英里了，问题就是要看清它的两根桅杆之间有没有烟囱。","But at the moment when Neb and the sailor were preparing to leave Granite House, the vessel suddenly altered her course, and stood directly for Union Bay.The brig was a good sailer, for she approached rapidly.Neb and Pencroft put off their departure, therefore, and the glass was put into Ayrton’s hands, that he might ascertain for certain whether the ship was or was not the “Duncan.”The Scotch yacht was also rigged as a brig.The question was, whether a chimney could be discerned between the two masts of the vessel, which was now at a distance of only five miles."
"海平面还很清晰。观察起来很容易，艾尔顿很快放下望远镜，说：","The horizon was still very clear.The examination was easy, and Ayrton soon let the glass fall again, saying—"
"“这不是‘邓肯’号！绝不是它！”","“It is not the ‘Duncan’!It could not be!”"
"潘克洛夫重新把这艘双桅船锁定在望远镜的视线里，只见船的吨位有三百到四百吨，船身完美狭长，樯帆齐整，结构精巧，这一定是一艘航海的快船。可它究竟是哪个国家的呢？这还很难说。","Pencroft again brought the brig within the range of the telescope, and could see that she was of between three and four hundred tons burden, wonderfully narrow, well-masted, admirably built, and must be a very rapid sailer.But to what nation did she belong?That was difficult to say."
"“不过，”水手接着说，“船顶上飘着一面旗，只是我看不清它的颜色。”","“And yet,” added the sailor, “a flag is floating from her peak, but I cannot distinguish the colors of it.”"
"“半个小时后就可以确定了。”记者说，“此外，那艘船的船长显然有上岸的打算，因此，今天，最晚不超过明天，我们就可以认识他了。”","“In half an hour we shall be certain about that,” answered the reporter.“Besides, it is very evident that the intention of the captain of this ship is to land, and, consequently, if not today, to-morrow at the latest, we shall make his acquaintance.”"
"“这个倒无所谓！”潘克洛夫说，“最好能知道我们将要和什么样的人打交道，要是能认出船上旗帜的颜色该多好啊！”","“Never mind!” said Pencroft.“It is best to know whom we have to deal with, and I shall not be sorry to recognize that fellow’s colors!”"
"说这些话的时候，水手的双眼始终没有离开望远镜。夜色开始降临，海上的风也随之减弱。双桅船的旗帜卷成一团，更加难以辨认了。","And, while thus speaking, the sailor never left the glass.The day began to fade, and with the day the breeze fell also.The brig’s ensign hung in folds, and it became more and more difficult to observe it."
"“这不是美国国旗，”潘克洛夫不时地说，“也不是英国国旗，否则上面的红颜色很容易看出来。也不是法国国旗或德国国旗，也不是俄国的白旗，也不是西班牙的黄旗。好像是一面单色旗。让我想一想：在这一带海面上，经常会遇见哪种旗？智利旗吗？——那是三色的。巴西旗？——那是绿色的。日本旗？——那是黑黄两色的，而这面旗——”","“It is not the American flag,” said Pencroft from time to time, “nor the English, the red of which could be easily seen, nor the French or German colors, nor the white flag of Russia, nor the yellow of Spain.One would say it was all one color.Let’s see: in these seas, what do we generally meet with?The Chilean flag?—but that is tri-color.Brazilian?—it is green.Japanese?—it is yellow and black, while this—”"
"这时候，一阵微风把这面陌生的旗吹开了。艾尔顿抓起水手放下来的望远镜，举到眼前，然后以嘶哑的声音喊道：","At that moment the breeze blew out the unknown flag.Ayrton seizing the telescope which the sailor had put down, put it to his eye, and in a hoarse voice,—"
"“是黑旗！”","“The black flag!” he exclaimed."
"的确，双桅船的桅杆上飘扬着一面阴森森的旗帜，现在大家完全有理由把它看做一艘可疑的船只了！","And indeed the somber bunting was floating from the mast of the brig, and they had now good reason for considering her to be a suspicious vessel!"
"这么说，工程师的预感是对的？这是一艘海盗船吗？它是不是在太平洋这一带海上出没，并且和在这里横行的马来船争霸呢？它到林肯岛附近的海岸来干什么？他们认为这是一座无名荒岛，准备在这里窝藏劫来的赃物吗？还是打算在海岛沿岸寻找一个过冬的港口？难道移民们的这片净土注定要成为一个肮脏之所、一个太平洋海盗的巢穴了吗？","Had the engineer, then, been right in his presentiments?Was this a pirate vessel?Did she scour the Pacific, competing with the Malay proas which still infest it?For what had she come to look at the shores of Lincoln Island?Was it to them an unknown island, ready to become a magazine for stolen cargoes?Had she come to find on the coast a sheltered port for the winter months?Was the settlers’ honest domain destined to be transformed into an infamous refuge—the headquarters of the piracy of the Pacific?"
"这些念头不由自主地出现在移民们的脑海里。此外，被升起的船旗的颜色所代表的意义已经毋庸置疑。那是海盗的旗子！要是当初那些罪犯的罪恶阴谋得逞的话，那么‘邓肯’号也会挂上这种旗子！大家立刻开始商量对策。","All these ideas instinctively presented themselves to the colonists’ imaginations.There was no doubt, besides, of the signification which must be attached to the color of the hoisted flag.It was that of pirates!It was that which the “Duncan” would have carried, had the convicts succeeded in their criminal design!No time was lost before discussing it."
"“朋友们，”赛勒斯·哈丁说，“也许这艘船只是想巡视一下岛的海岸。也许船员根本不会上岸。这也是可能的。不管怎样，我们必须尽量把自己隐藏起来。眺望岗上的风车太容易被看到了。艾尔顿和纳布去把风翼拆下来。同时，花岗石宫的窗户也要用厚厚的树枝遮住。火也要全部熄灭，总之，不要暴露任何岛上有人的痕迹。”","“My friends,” said Cyrus Harding, “perhaps this vessel only wishes to survey the coast of the island.Perhaps her crew will not land.There is a chance of it.However that may be, we ought to do everything we can to hide our presence here.The windmill on Prospect Heights is too easily seen.Let Ayrton and Neb go and take down the sails.We must also conceal the windows of Granite House with thick branches.All the fires must be extinguished, so that nothing may betray the presence of men on the island.”"
"“我们的船怎么办？”赫伯特问道。","“And our vessel?” said Herbert."
"“噢，”潘克洛夫回答说，“它藏在气球港呢，我不相信这些无赖能找到它！”","“Oh,” answered Pencroft, “she is sheltered in Port Balloon, and I defy any of those rascals there to find her!”"
"工程师的命令立刻得到了执行。纳布和艾尔顿爬上了高地，采取了必要的措施，以掩盖任何岛上有人居住的迹象。当他们在进行这项工作的时候，其他人从啄木鸟林的边缘捡回了许多树枝和藤条，从远处看，它们像是天然的树叶，花岗石宫的窗户就这样伪装起来了。同时，枪支弹药也安置妥当了，随时可以用来应付突然袭击。","The engineer’s orders were immediately executed.Neb and Ayrton ascended the plateau, and took the necessary precautions to conceal any indication of a settlement.While they were thus occupied, their companions went to the border of Jacamar Wood, and brought back a large quantity of branches and creepers, which would at some distance appear as natural foliage, and thus disguise the windows in the granite cliff.At the same time, the ammunition and guns were placed ready so as to be at hand in case of an unexpected attack."
"当所有这些设施都安置妥当以后——","When all these precautions had been taken,—"
"哈丁说：“朋友们，”他的声音暴露了他内心的情感，“假如这些混蛋想占领林肯岛，我们一定要保卫它，对吗？”","“My friends,” said Harding, and his voice betrayed some emotion, “if the wretches endeavor to seize Lincoln Island, we shall defend it—shall we not?”"
"“对，赛勒斯，”记者回答说，“必要的时候，我们不惜牺牲生命来保卫它！”","“Yes, Cyrus,” replied the reporter, “and if necessary we will die to defend it!”"
"工程师向伙伴们伸出手来，大家热烈地握紧他的手。艾尔顿还是一个人呆在角落里，没有和大家一起握手。作为一名昔日的罪犯，也许他认为自己还没有资格这样做！","The engineer extended his hand to his companions, who pressed it warmly.Ayrton remained in his corner, not joining the colonists.Perhaps he, the former convict, still felt himself unworthy to do so!"
"赛勒斯·哈丁明白艾尔通的心里的想法，就走到他身边。","Cyrus Harding understood what was passing in Ayrton’s mind, and going to him—"
"“你呢，艾尔顿，”他问道，“你会怎么办？”","“And you, Ayrton,” he asked, “what will you do?”"
"“尽我的义务。”艾尔顿回答。","“My duty,” answered Ayrton."
"说完他站到窗边，透过树枝往外看。","He then took up his station near the window and gazed through the foliage."
"这时是七点半。太阳早在20分钟前就消失在了花岗石宫的后面。接着，东方的海平面逐渐模糊起来。这时候，双桅船继续向联合湾驶去。它绕过爪角之后，便顺着上涨的潮流往北而去，现在，它正对着眺望岗的高地，离联合湾不到两英里。到了这个距离，甚至可以说已经进入了宽广的海湾，因为如果在爪角和颚骨角之间划一条直线，那么这条直线正穿过船右舷的后侧部分。","It was now half-past seven.The sun had disappeared twenty minutes ago behind Granite House.Consequently the Eastern horizon was becoming obscured.In the meanwhile the brig continued to advance towards Union Bay.She was now not more than two miles off, and exactly opposite the plateau of Prospect Heights, for after having tacked off Claw Cape, she had drifted towards the north in the current of the rising tide.One might have said that at this distance she had already entered the vast bay, for a straight line drawn from Claw Cape to Cape Mandible would have rested on her starboard quarter."
"这艘船是否打算深入海湾？这是第一个问题。船一旦进入了海湾，会不会在那里抛锚？这是第二个问题。它是否会仅仅满足于巡视一下海岸，不让船员们上岸就离开？再过一个小时，他们就能知道答案了。移民们目前只能等待。","Was the brig about to penetrate far into the bay?That was the first question.When once in the bay, would she anchor there?That was the second.Would she not content herself with only surveying the coast, and stand out to sea again without landing her crew?They would know this in an hour.The colonists could do nothing but wait."
"看了这艘可疑的船只所悬挂的黑旗之后，赛勒斯·哈丁深感忧虑。迄今为止，他和伙伴们的工作都非常顺利，这艘船的到来会不会对此正好构成威胁？双桅船的水手们毫无疑问只能是一群海盗，他们是不是曾经来过这里，因此在靠岸的时候才挂起黑旗呢？他们会不会曾经侵占过这个小岛呢？这样的话，某些至今无法解释的怪事也许就能水落石出了。在岛上那些尚未勘探的地方，会不会还有海盗的同伙准备与双桅船上的海盗联系呢？","Cyrus Harding had not seen the suspected vessel hoist the black flag without deep anxiety.Was it not a direct menace against the work which he and his companions had till now conducted so successfully?Had these pirates—for the sailors of the brig could be nothing else—already visited the island, since on approaching it they had hoisted their colors.Had they formerly invaded it, so that certain unaccountable peculiarities might be explained in this way?Did there exist in the as yet unexplored parts some accomplice ready to enter into communication with them?"
"哈丁暗自思考着这些问题，却不知如何回答；但他觉得，这艘双桅船的到来，只会对移民们的安全带来严重的威胁。","To all these questions which he mentally asked himself, Harding knew not what to reply; but he felt that the safety of the colony could not but be seriously threatened by the arrival of the brig."
"不管怎样，他和他的同伴们决心抵抗到底。目前知道以下这些信息是很重要的：这些海盗的人数多不多？他们的装备是不是比移民们优良？可是如何获取这些消息呢？","However, he and his companions were determined to fight to the last gasp.It would have been very important to know if the pirates were numerous and better armed than the colonists.But how was this information to he obtained?"
"夜晚来临了。新月已经消失。小岛和海面被一片漆黑笼罩着。海平面上盖着厚重的乌云，透不过一丝光线。风也随着暮色消失了。树叶的沙沙声和岸边潺潺的水声也听不见了。双桅船上的灯光全部熄灭了，因此一点也看不见它，即使它还在小岛附近，却无法断定它的行踪了。","Night fell.The new moon had disappeared.Profound darkness enveloped the island and the sea.No light could pierce through the heavy piles of clouds on the horizon.The wind had died away completely with the twilight.Not a leaf rustled on the trees, not a ripple murmured on the shore.Nothing could be seen of the ship, all her lights being extinguished, and if she was still in sight of the island, her whereabouts could not be discovered."
"“哎！谁知道呢？”潘克洛夫说，“也许这艘该死的船会在夜里开走，明天黎明时分我们就找不到它了。”","“Well! who knows?” said Pencroft.“Perhaps that cursed craft will stand off during the night, and we shall see nothing of her at daybreak.”"
"这时，黑暗中突然闪过一道亮光，接着传来一声炮响，仿佛是在回答水手的话。","As if in reply to the sailor’s observation, a bright light flashed in the darkness, and a cannon-shot was heard."
"船还在那里，而且船上有大炮。","The vessel was still there and had guns on board."
"从看见闪光到听见炮声，中间有六秒钟的间隔。","Six seconds elapsed between the flash and the report."
"因此，双桅船距离海岸大约有一又四分之一海里。","Therefore the brig was about a mile and a quarter from the coast."
"这时，大家听见了铁链从链孔里放出来的哗哗声。","At the same time, the chains were heard rattling through the hawse-holes."
"船在花岗石宫的视线内抛锚了！","The vessel had just anchored in sight of Granite House!"
"第二章","Chapter 2"
"海盗们的企图已经很明显了。他们在离岛不远的地方下了锚，显然是打算第二天乘小艇登上海滩。","There was no longer any doubt as to the pirates’ intentions.They had dropped anchor at a short distance from the island, and it was evident that the next day by means of their boats they purposed to land on the beach!"
"赛勒斯·哈丁和同伴们随时准备行动，但是，尽管他们下定了决心，也不能轻举妄动。如果海盗们上岸后不深入岛内进行视察，那么他们也许还可以隐藏起来。这些海盗也许只是想从慈悲河里取一些淡水，这样的话，他们也可能发现不了离河口一英里半的那座桥和“石窟”那里的工厂。","Cyrus Harding and his companions were ready to act, but, determined though they were, they must not forget to be prudent.Perhaps their presence might still be concealed in the event of the pirates contenting themselves with landing on the shore without examining the interior of the island.It might be, indeed, that their only intention was to obtain fresh water from the Mercy, and it was not impossible that the bridge, thrown across a mile and a half from the mouth, and the manufactory at the Chimneys might escape their notice."
"但是，为什么要在船顶上挂起那面旗呢？为什么又要开那一炮呢？毫无疑问，这是一种纯粹的示威，不然就表示占领孤岛的一种行为。哈丁现在知道，船上的装备十分精良。那么林肯岛上的移民们有什么武器可以对付海盗们的大炮呢？只不过有几杆滑膛枪而已。","But why was that flag hoisted at the brig’s peak?What was that shot fired for?Pure bravado doubtless, unless it was a sign of the act of taking possession.Harding knew now that the vessel was well armed.And what had the colonists of Lincoln Island to reply to the pirates’ guns?A few muskets only."
"“不管怎样，”赛勒斯·哈丁指出，“我们这里所在的位置牢不可破。花岗石宫的出口隐蔽在芦苇和杂草丛中，敌人是发现不了的，因此他们就不可能闯进来。”","“However,” observed Cyrus Harding, “here we are in an impregnable position.The enemy cannot discover the mouth of the outlet, now that it is hidden under reeds and grass, and consequently it would be impossible for them to penetrate into Granite House.”"
"“可是我们的农场该怎么办？还有家禽场、畜栏，和所有这一切！”潘克洛夫跺着脚嚷道。“要不了几个小时，他们就能把这一切都给毁了！”","“But our plantations, our poultry-yard, our corral, all, everything!” exclaimed Pencroft, stamping his foot.“They may spoil everything, destroy everything in a few hours!”"
"“是的，一切都会被毁灭的，潘克洛夫，”哈丁回答说，“可我们没有任何办法可以阻止他们。”","“Everything, Pencroft,” answered Harding, “and we have no means of preventing them.”"
"“问题在于他们人多不多，”记者说，“如果他们只有十来个人，我们可以阻止他们，但要是有四十、五十甚至更多人的话……”","“Are they numerous? that is the question,” said the reporter.“If they are not more than a dozen, we shall be able to stop them, but forty, fifty, more perhaps!”"
"“哈丁队长，”艾尔顿一边说，一边朝工程师走去，“你能答应让我离开一下吗？”","“Captain Harding,” then said Ayrton, advancing towards the engineer, “will you give me leave?”"
"“什么事，朋友？”","“For what, my friend?”"
"“让我到船上去打探一下敌人的实力。”","“To go to that vessel to find out the strength of her crew.”"
"“可是，艾尔顿……”工程师犹豫不决地回答，“这样做会有生命危险……”","“But Ayrton—” answered the engineer, hesitating, “you will risk your life—”"
"“为什么不试一试呢，先生？”","“Why not, sir?”"
"“这不是你分内的事情。”","“That is more than your duty.”"
"“分外的事我也应该做。”艾尔顿答道。","“I have more than my duty to do,” replied Ayrton."
"“你打算坐小船去接近那艘船吗？”吉迪恩·史佩莱问。","“Will you go to the ship in the boat?” asked Gideon Spilett."
"“不，先生，我泅水过去。坐船去会被发现的，而光一个人去则可以从风浪之中潜水过去。”","“No, sir, but I will swim.A boat would be seen where a man may glide between wind and water.”"
"“你可知道，双桅船离海岸有一又四分之一英里呢！”赫伯特说道。","“Do you know that the brig is a mile and a quarter from the shore?” said Herbert."
"“我水性很好，赫伯特先生。”","“I am a good swimmer, Mr. Herbert.”"
"“我要提醒你，这样做有生命危险。”工程师说。","“I tell you it is risking your life,” said the engineer."
"“没关系，”艾尔顿回答说，“哈丁队长，请同意我的请求。在我看来，这也许是我重新做人的一次机会！”","“That is no matter,” answered Ayrton.“Captain Harding, I ask this as a favor.Perhaps it will be a means of raising me in my own eyes!”"
"“去吧，艾尔顿。”工程师答道，他明白，如果他拒绝，会深深伤害这位已经改邪归正的前罪犯。","“Go, Ayrton,” replied the engineer, who felt sure that a refusal would have deeply wounded the former convict, now become an honest man."
"“我陪你去。”潘克洛夫说。","“I will accompany you,” said Pencroft."
"“你不信任我！”艾尔顿立刻说。","“You mistrust me!” said Ayrton quickly."
"然后又谦卑地叹了一口气：","Then more humbly,—"
"“唉！”","“Alas!”"
"“不！不！”哈丁带着鼓励的口吻说，“不是这样的，艾尔顿，潘克洛夫并没有不信任你。你误解了他的话。”","“No! no!” exclaimed Harding with animation, “no, Ayrton, Pencroft does not mistrust you.You interpret his words wrongly.”"
"“不错，”水手回答说，“我只是想把艾尔顿送到小岛上。尽管不太可能，但也许那些混蛋中已经有人上岸了，真要是这样，要阻止他报信，两个人就不算多了。既然艾尔顿提出要上船，那就让他一个人去，我留在小岛上等他。”事情谈妥之后，艾尔顿便准备出发了。他的计划很大胆，但幸好有夜色的保护，还是有可能取得成功。只要艾尔通能到达船边，抓住主链，他就可以侦查出海盗的人数，或许还能偷听到他们的企图。","“Indeed,” returned the sailor, “I only propose to accompany Ayrton as far as the islet.It may be, although it is scarcely possible, that one of these villains has landed, and in that case two men will not be too many to hinder him from giving the alarm.I will wait for Ayrton on the islet, and he shall go alone to the vessel, since he has proposed to do so.”These things agreed to, Ayrton made preparations for his departure.His plan was bold, but it might succeed, thanks to the darkness of the night.Once arrived at the vessel’s side, Ayrton, holding on to the main chains, might reconnoiter the number and perhaps overhear the intentions of the pirates."
"艾尔顿和潘克洛夫在同伴们的陪同下，来到了下面的海滩上。艾尔顿脱掉衣服，在身上抹了一层油，以免受冻，因为海水还很凉。事实上，也许他将不得不在水里呆上好几个小时。","Ayrton and Pencroft, followed by their companions, descended to the beach.Ayrton undressed and rubbed himself with grease, so as to suffer less from the temperature of the water, which was still cold.He might, indeed, be obliged to remain in it for several hours."
"这时候，潘克洛夫和纳布去几百英尺远的慈悲河河滩上搬停靠在那里的小船。他们回来时，艾尔顿已经准备好要出发了。他把衣服搭在肩膀上，移民们都跑过来和他握手。","Pencroft and Neb, during this time, had gone to fetch the boat, moored a few hundred feet higher up, on the bank of the Mercy, and by the time they returned, Ayrton was ready to start.A coat was thrown over his shoulders, and the settlers all came round him to press his hand."
"接着艾尔顿和潘克洛夫就把船开走了。","Ayrton then shoved off with Pencroft in the boat."
"晚上十点半，这两位冒险家消失在夜色之中。他们的同伴则回到“石窟”那，等待他们归来。","It was half-past ten in the evening when the two adventurers disappeared in the darkness.Their companions returned to wait at the Chimneys."
"小船顺利度过海峡，在对面的小岛上靠了岸。他们做这一切的时候非常小心，生怕海盗们会在这一带游荡。不过经过一番仔细侦察，他们确信岛上没有其他人。于是，艾尔顿在潘克洛夫前面，迅速穿过小岛，惊动了那些在石洞里的鸟儿们；接着，艾尔顿毫不犹豫地跳进海里，无声无息地朝双桅船游去，船上刚刚亮起几盏灯，指明了它的确切位置。潘克洛夫蹲在石缝中，等待同伴归来。","The channel was easily traversed, and the boat touched the opposite shore of the islet.This was not done without precaution, for fear lest the pirates might be roaming about there.But after a careful survey, it was evident that the islet was deserted.Ayrton then, followed by Pencroft, crossed it with a rapid step, scaring the birds nestled in the holes of the rocks; then, without hesitating, he plunged into the sea, and swam noiselessly in the direction of the ship, in which a few lights had recently appeared, showing her exact situation.As to Pencroft, he crouched down in a cleft of the rock, and awaited the return of his companion."
"这时候，艾尔顿在水中奋力向前游，没有发出丝毫声响。他只把头露出水面，两眼盯着双桅船那黑暗的船身，那里可以看见船上的灯光映在水中。他所想到的只是履行自己的承诺，完成任务，而他将要面临的危险——无论是来自船上，还是来自常有鲨鱼出没的海中——他都丝毫没有想到。水流带着他前进，很快就离开了海岸。半小时后，艾尔顿在无人看见和听到的情况下到了船边，抓住了船的主链。他吸了一口气，攀着铁链,一直爬上了船头的顶端。那里晾着几条水手裤。他穿上一条。然后站稳脚跟，听了起来。双桅船上的人都没有睡。反而在说笑唱歌。有时还夹杂着谩骂，最让艾尔顿震惊的是这几句话：","In the meanwhile, Ayrton, swimming with a vigorous stroke, glided through the sheet of water without producing the slightest ripple.His head just emerged above it and his eyes were fixed on the dark hull of the brig, from which the lights were reflected in the water.He thought only of the duty which he had promised to accomplish, and nothing of the danger which he ran, not only on board the ship, but in the sea, often frequented by sharks.The current bore him along and he rapidly receded from the shore.Half an hour afterwards, Ayrton, without having been either seen or heard, arrived at the ship and caught hold of the main-chains.He took breath, then, hoisting himself up, he managed to reach the extremity of the cutwater.There were drying several pairs of sailors’ trousers.He put on a pair.Then settling himself firmly, he listened.They were not sleeping on board the brig.On the contrary, they were talking, singing, laughing.And these were the sentences, accompanied with oaths, which principally struck Ayrton:—"
"“我们抢来的这艘船真是太棒了！”","“Our brig is a famous acquisition.”"
"“它开得真快！不愧叫‘飞快’号！”","“She sails well, and merits her name of the ‘Speedy.’”"
"“诺福克的海军船队没有一只能追得上它。”","“She would show all the navy of Norfolk a clean pair of heels.”"
"“船长万岁！”","“Hurrah for her captain!”"
"“鲍勃·哈维万岁！”","“Hurrah for Bob Harvey!”"
"当艾尔顿从谈话的只言片语中听到鲍勃·哈维这个名字，艾尔通想起了他过去在澳大利亚的一个同伴，这个人是个胆大包天的水手，现在还在继续干罪恶的勾当。了解了这一点，就可以理解艾尔顿听到这段话的心情了。鲍勃·哈维在诺福克岛的海岸上抢夺了这艘双桅船，当时船上满载着各种武器、弹药、器皿和各种工具，朝三明治群岛的一个岛屿驶去。鲍勃·哈维和他的同伴们抢到这艘船以后，就由罪犯变成了海盗，这帮匪徒出没在太平洋上，毁坏船只，屠杀船员，只怕比马来海盗还要残忍。","What Ayrton felt when he overheard this fragment of conversation may be understood when it is known that in this Bob Harvey he recognized one of his old Australian companions, a daring sailor, who had continued his criminal career.Bob Harvey had seized, on the shores of Norfolk Island this brig, which was loaded with arms, ammunition, utensils, and tools of all sorts, destined for one of the Sandwich Islands.All his gang had gone on board, and pirates after having been convicts, these wretches, more ferocious than the Malays themselves, scoured the Pacific, destroying vessels, and massacring their crews."
"罪犯们一边开怀畅饮，一边大声地讲述着他们的“战绩”，从他们的话中，艾尔顿得知：“飞快号”现在的船员全都是从诺福克岛上逃出来的英国囚犯。","The convicts spoke loudly, they recounted their deeds, drinking deeply at the same time, and this is what Ayrton gathered.The actual crew of the “Speedy” was composed solely of English prisoners, escaped from Norfolk Island."
"现在不妨介绍一下诺福克岛的情况。在澳大利亚以东，南纬29度2分，东经165度42分的地方，有一个方圆六海里的小岛，岛上的最高峰名叫皮特山，海拔一千一百英尺。这座小岛就是诺福克岛，曾经是为了关押英国监狱里最冥顽不化的罪犯们所建设的一处地方。当时岛上有500名罪犯，他们必须接受铁一般的纪律和可怕的惩罚，此外还有150名士兵看管，这150名士兵都听从总督的命令。很难想象有比这群恶棍更坏的人聚集在一起的情况了。尽管他们受到严密的监视，但有时候还是有人得以逃跑——虽然这种情况并不多见，他们突袭船只，然后抢过来，在波里尼西亚群岛一带到处骚扰。","Here it may be well to explain what this island was.In 29deg 2’ south latitude, and 165deg 42’ east longitude, to the east of Australia, is found a little island, six miles in circumference, overlooked by Mount Pitt, which rises to a height of 1,100 feet above the level of the sea.This is Norfolk Island, once the seat of an establishment in which were lodged the most intractable convicts from the English penitentiaries.They numbered 500, under an iron discipline, threatened with terrible punishments, and were guarded by 150 soldiers, and 150 employed under the orders of the governor.It would be difficult to imagine a collection of greater ruffians.Sometimes,—although very rarely,—notwithstanding the extreme surveillance of which they were the object, many managed to escape, and seizing vessels which they surprised, they infested the Polynesian Archipelagoes."
"这就是鲍勃·哈维和他的同伙们所干的勾当。　也是艾尔顿曾经想干的事情。鲍勃·哈维抢夺了停在诺福克岛附近的“飞快号”，屠杀了船上的船员。一年来，在他的指挥下，这艘船在太平洋上大肆劫掠，现在他是一个海盗，而且是艾尔顿的旧相识！","Thus had Bob Harvey and his companions done.Thus had Ayrton formerly wished to do.Bob Harvey had seized the brig “Speedy,” anchored in sight of Norfolk Island; the crew had been massacred; and for a year this ship had scoured the Pacific, under the command of Harvey, now a pirate, and well known to Ayrton!"
"罪犯们大部分都聚集在船尾的舱里，但也有几个躺在甲板上大声说话。","The convicts were, for the most part, assembled under the poop; but a few, stretched on the deck, were talking loudly."
"他们一边狂喊着饮酒，一边继续谈话。艾尔顿得知“飞快号”是偶然来到了林肯岛附近，鲍勃·哈维还从未上岸；但正如赛勒斯·哈丁所预料的那样，他在航行途中发现了这块连地图上都没有标记的陌生陆地时，便打算上岸勘察一番，如果合适，就把它当作双桅船的基地。","The conversation still continued amid shouts and libations.Ayrton learned that chance alone had brought the “Speedy” in sight of Lincoln Island; Bob Harvey had never yet set foot on it; but, as Cyrus Harding had conjectured, finding this unknown land in his course, its position being marked on no chart, he had formed the project of visiting it, and, if he found it suitable, of making it the brig’s headquarters."
"至于“飞快号”船顶的黑旗和模仿战舰降旗时鸣放的礼炮，这纯粹是海盗们的示威行为。决不是什么信号，因为这些罪犯和林肯岛之间不存在任何联系。","As to the black flag hoisted at the “Speedy’s” peak, and the gun which had been fired, in imitation of men-of-war when they lower their colors, it was pure piratical bravado.It was in no way a signal, and no communication yet existed between the convicts and Lincoln Island."
"现在，移民们的领地正被巨大的危险所威胁。岛上有淡水补给站和港口，经过移民们的开发，各种资源也变得更有价值，还有可供藏身的花岗石宫，这一切对罪犯们来说，显然是再便利不过了。一旦小岛落入他们之手，就会成为一个绝好的藏身之所，而且，正因为无人知晓，也许在很长一段时间里，都能保证他们逍遥法外，平安无事。同样明显的是，他们是不会重视移民们的生命的，而鲍勃·哈维和他的同伙考虑的头号事情，就是毫不留情地杀死他们。赛勒斯·哈丁和他的同伴们甚至都无法选择逃跑或隐藏，因为罪犯们打算在岛上住下来，即便是“飞快号”出海打劫的时候，也有可能留几个人在岛上看守。所以，移民们必须战斗，必须把这些恶棍消灭干净，他们根本不值得同情，对他们采取任何手段都不过分。艾尔顿这样想着，他清楚，赛勒斯·哈丁一定和他的想法一样。","The settlers’ domain was now menaced with terrible danger.Evidently the island, with its water, its harbor, its resources of all kinds so increased in value by the colonists, and the concealment afforded by Granite House, could not but be convenient for the convicts; in their hands it would become an excellent place of refuge, and, being unknown, it would assure them, for a long time perhaps, impunity and security.Evidently, also, the lives of the settlers would not be respected, and Bob Harvey and his accomplices’ first care would be to massacre them without mercy.Harding and his companions had, therefore, not even the choice of flying and hiding themselves in the island, since the convicts intended to reside there, and since, in the event of the “Speedy” departing on an expedition, it was probable that some of the crew would remain on shore, so as to settle themselves there.Therefore, it would be necessary to fight, to destroy every one of these scoundrels, unworthy of pity, and against whom any means would be right.So thought Ayrton, and he well knew that Cyrus Harding would be of his way of thinking."
"可是，抵抗并取得最后胜利是否可能呢？这就要看船上的装备和人数了。","But was resistance and, in the last place, victory possible?That would depend on the equipment of the brig, and the number of men which she carried."
"艾尔顿决定不惜任何代价弄清这一点，他上船一个小时候后，喧嚷声逐渐消失，许多罪犯已经烂醉如泥了，船上的灯也已经熄灭，“飞快号”一片漆黑，于是艾尔顿毫不犹豫地冒险爬上了甲板。他抓住船头，翻过斜桅，爬到前甲板上。艾尔顿从横七竖八躺着的罪犯们中间穿过，在船上绕了一圈，发现“飞快号”上装备有四门大炮，可以发射八至十磅的炮弹。他用手摸了摸，还发现这些都是后膛炮。这是一种新式火炮，操纵简单，威力巨大。","This Ayrton resolved to learn at any cost, and as an hour after his arrival the vociferations had begun to die away, and as a large number of the convicts were already buried in a drunken sleep, Ayrton did not hesitate to venture onto the “Speedy’s” deck, which the extinguished lanterns now left in total darkness.He hoisted himself onto the cutwater, and by the bowsprit arrived at the forecastle.Then, gliding among the convicts stretched here and there, he made the round of the ship, and found that the “Speedy” carried four guns, which would throw shot of from eight to ten pounds in weight.He found also, on touching them that these guns were breech-loaders.They were therefore, of modern make, easily used, and of terrible effect."
"甲板上躺着十来个人，但可以想象得到，一定还有更多人睡在船舱里。何况艾尔顿从他们的谈话中得知，船上大约有50个人。对林肯岛上的六个移民来说，这们多的人可够他们对付的了！不过，多亏艾尔通的奋不顾身，赛勒斯·哈丁不会手足无措，他可以知道敌人的实力，并且会做出相应的部署。","As to the men lying on the deck, they were about ten in number, but it was to be supposed that more were sleeping down below.Besides, by listening to them, Ayrton had understood that there were fifty on board.That was a large number for the six settlers of Lincoln Island to contend with!But now, thanks to Ayrton’s devotion, Cyrus Harding would not be surprised, he would know the strength of his adversaries, and would make his arrangements accordingly."
"艾尔顿已经完成任务，只要回去向同伴们报告就行了，他准备到船头去，从那里下水。但是，正如他说的那样，分外的事他也要做，他的脑海里突然产生一个英勇的念头：牺牲自己的生命，来挽救林肯岛和岛上的移民们。显然，赛勒斯·哈丁无法抵抗这50个歹徒，他们的武器精良，可以集中主力直捣花岗石宫，也可以把移民们围困起来饿死，无论采取哪种方法，他们都能够达到目的。这时候，艾尔顿想起了他的救命恩人们——那些让他重获新生，变得诚实的人，那些对他恩重如山的人。但是，他们就要被无情地杀害了，他们的劳动成果将遭到毁坏，他们的岛屿将要变成海盗的巢穴！他对自己说：造成这么多不幸的罪魁祸首是他自己，因为他的老伙伴鲍勃·哈维只不过是实现了他过去的计划而已，想到这里，他不禁毛骨悚然。他的脑子里有一个不可抗拒的念头：炸毁双桅船，炸死船上所有的人。虽然他自己也会在爆炸中死去，但总算尽到了自己的责任。","There was nothing more for Ayrton to do but to return, and render to his companions an account of the mission with which he had charged himself, and he prepared to regain the bows of the brig, so that he might let himself down into the water.But to this man, whose wish was, as he had said, to do more than his duty, there came an heroic thought.This was to sacrifice his own life, but save the island and the colonists.Cyrus Harding evidently could not resist fifty ruffians, all well armed, who, either by penetrating by main force into Granite House, or by starving out the besieged, could obtain from them what they wanted.And then he thought of his preservers—those who had made him again a man, and an honest mm, those to whom he owed all—murdered without pity, their works destroyed, their island turned into a pirates’ den!He said to himself that he, Ayrton, was the principal cause of so many disasters, since his old companion, Bob Harvey, had but realized his own plans, and a feeling of horror took possession of him.Then he was seized with an irresistible desire to blow up the brig and with her, all whom she had on board.He would perish in the explosion, but he would have done his duty."
"艾尔顿没有犹豫。要找到火药库并不困难，它通常在船的后半部分。对于一艘从事海盗勾当的船来说，火药是不会缺乏的，只需要一点火星，就足以瞬间将它炸毁。","Ayrton did not hesitate.To reach the powder-room, which is always situated in the after-part of a vessel, was easy.There would be no want of powder in a vessel which followed such a trade, and a spark would be enough to destroy it in an instant."
"艾尔顿小心翼翼地沿着中舱甲板走去，那里躺着很多人，他们大多是喝醉了酒，而不是真正睡着的。主桅的底部亮着一盏灯，周围支着一个枪架，上面有各种武器。","Ayrton stole carefully along the between-decks, strewn with numerous sleepers, overcome more by drunkenness than sleep.A lantern was lighted at the foot of the mainmast, round which was hung a gun-rack, furnished with weapons of all sorts."
"艾尔顿从枪架上拿了一支左轮手枪，并且确认子弹已经上了膛。有了它就足以完成破坏工作了。于是他直奔船尾，到后舱下面的火药库去。","Ayrton took a revolver from the rack, and assured himself that it was loaded and primed.Nothing more was needed to accomplish the work of destruction.He then glided towards the stern, so as to arrive under the brig’s poop at the powder-magazine."
"甲板上光线很暗，要想走过去，而不被那些半醉半醒的罪犯绊倒，可不是件容易的事，每当绊到那些罪犯，他们不是张口谩骂，就是伸脚踢人。因此，艾尔顿一再被迫停下脚步。不过最后，他总算来到了后舱的隔板前，找到了火药库的门。","It was difficult to proceed along the dimly lighted deck without stumbling over some half-sleeping convict, who retorted by oaths and kicks.Ayrton was, therefore, more than once obliged to halt.But at last he arrived at the partition dividing the aftercabin, and found the door opening into the magazine itself."
"除了把门砸开，艾尔顿没有其他办法，于是他就开始动手了。干这活儿难免发出一些声响，因为要砸开一把挂锁。不过，艾尔顿臂力过人，一下子拧坏了挂锁，库门开了。","Ayrton, compelled to force it open, set to work.It was a difficult operation to perform without noise, for he had to break a padlock.But under his vigorous hand, the padlock broke, and the door was open."
"这时候，突然有一只手搭在艾尔顿的肩上。","At that moment a hand was laid on Ayrton’s shoulder."
"“你在这儿做什么？”一个尾随着他而来的人厉声问道，那个人站在影子里，立刻把灯光照在艾尔顿的脸上。","“What are you doing here?” asked a tail man, in a harsh voice, who, standing in the shadow, quickly threw the light of a lantern in Ayrton’s face."
"艾尔顿退后几步。借着一闪而过的灯光，他认出了自己昔日的同伴鲍勃·哈维，不过对方并没有认出他来，他以为艾尔顿早就死了。","Ayrton drew beck.In the rapid flash of the lantern, he had recognized his former accomplice, Bob Harvey, who could not have known him, as he must have thought Ayrton long since dead."
"“你在这儿做什么？”鲍勃·哈维抓住艾尔顿的裤腰带，又问了一遍。","“What are you doing here?” again said Bob Harvey, seizing Ayrton by the waistband."
"但是艾尔顿没有回答，他挣脱鲍勃·哈维的手，试图冲进火药库。只要朝这些火药桶的中间开上一枪，一切就全都结束了！","But Ayrton, without replying, wrenched himself from his grasp and attempted to rush into the magazine.A shot fired into the midst of the powder-casks, and all would be over!"
"“快来人，伙计们！”鲍勃·哈维喊道。","“Help, lads!” shouted Bob Harvey."
"有两三个海盗被喊醒了，他们跳起身来，向艾尔顿扑去，想把他扳倒在地。艾尔顿奋力挣脱。他朝他们开了两枪，两个罪犯倒下了，可是他自己也因为躲闪不及，肩膀上被砍了一刀。","At his shout two or three pirates awoke, jumped up, and, rushing on Ayrton, endeavored to throw him down.He soon extricated himself from their grasp.He fired his revolver, and two of the convicts fell, but a blow from a knife which he could not ward off made a gash in his shoulder."
"艾尔顿明白他的计划已无法实现了。鲍勃·哈维关上火药库的大门，甲板上又是一片混乱，海盗们全都惊醒过来了。艾尔顿必须保全自己，和赛勒斯·哈丁他们并肩作战。因此他只能夺路而逃。","Ayrton perceived that he could no longer hope to carry out his project.Bob Harvey had reclosed the door of the powder-magazine, and a movement on the deck indicated a general awakening of the pirates.Ayrton must reserve himself to fight at the side of Cyrus Harding.There was nothing for him but flight!"
"但是，还能逃得了吗？这是个问题，不过艾尔顿已经下定决心，要不惜一切代价回到同伴那里去。","But was flight still possible?It was doubtful, yet Ayrton resolved to dare everything in order to rejoin his companions."
"艾尔顿的枪里只剩下四颗子弹。他开了两枪，一枪是朝鲍勃·哈维开的，不过没有打中，即使打中了，最多也只是轻伤，艾尔顿利用敌人稍稍后退的工夫，冲上扶梯，往甲板跑去。经过照明灯的时候，他用枪托把灯打灭了。于是周围漆黑一片，这对他逃跑十分有利。这时候，两三个海盗被惊醒了，正从扶梯上跑下来。","Four barrels of the revolver were still undischarged.Two were fired—one, aimed at Bob Harvey, did not wound him, or at any rate only slightly, and Ayrton, profiting by the momentary retreat of his adversaries, rushed towards the companion-ladder to gain the deck.Passing before the lantern, he smashed it with a blow from the butt of his revolver.A profound darkness ensued, which favored his flight.Two or three pirates, awakened by the noise, were descending the ladder at the same moment."
"艾尔顿开了第五枪，打倒了其中一个，其他人还不知道发生了什么事情，立刻四散躲避。艾尔通两步跳上甲板，三秒钟后，一个海盗刚要掐住他的脖子，他把最后一颗子弹打在了海盗的脸上，然后越过舷墙，纵身跳进了大海。","A fifth shot from Ayrton laid one low, and the others drew back, not understanding what was going on.Ayrton was on deck in two bounds, and three seconds later, having discharged his last barrel in the face of a pirate who was about to seize him by the throat, he leaped over the bulwarks into the sea."
"艾尔顿划了还不到六下，子弹就像冰雹似的向他周围打来。","Ayrton had not made six strokes before shots were splashing around him like hail."
"听到船上传来的枪声，躲在小岛岩石下的潘克洛夫会怎么想呢？还有蹲在“石窟”里的哈丁、记者、赫伯特和纳布，心里又会怎么想呢？他们背着枪，冲到海滩上，随时准备抵抗敌人的攻击。","What were Pencroft’s feelings, sheltered under a rock on the islet!What were those of Harding, the reporter, Herbert, and Neb, crouched in the Chimneys, when they heard the reports on board the brig!They rushed out on to the beach, and, their guns shouldered, they stood ready to repel any attack."
"他们对此深信不疑！海盗们发现了艾尔顿，并把他杀死了，也许这些恶棍还要趁夜黑到岛上来呢！","They had no doubt about it themselves!Ayrton, surprised by the pirates, had been murdered, and, perhaps, the wretches would profit by the night to make a descent on the island!"
"他们在极度不安中度过了半个小时。枪声已经停止了，但艾尔顿和潘克洛夫都还没有回来。难道小岛已经被占领了吗？是不是应该赶快去援救艾尔顿和潘克洛夫？可怎么救援呢？这时候正在涨潮，根本渡不过海峡。再说小船也不在这里！不难想象，哈丁和他的同伴们该是多么焦急！","Half an hour was passed in terrible anxiety.The firing had ceased, and yet neither Ayrton nor Pencroft had reappeared.Was the islet invaded?Ought they not to fly to the help of Ayrton and Pencroft?But how?The tide being high at that time, rendered the channel impassable.The boat was not there!We may imagine the horrible anxiety which took possession of Harding and his companions!"
"终于，将近十二点半的时候，小船载着他们两人靠岸了。艾尔顿的肩膀受了轻伤，潘克洛夫则安然无恙，大家张开双臂，迎接他们的归来。","At last, towards half-past twelve, a boat, carrying two men, touched the beach.It was Ayrton, slightly wounded in the shoulder, and Pencroft, safe and sound, whom their friends received with open arms."
"所有人立刻躲进了“石窟”。艾尔顿把事情的经过讲了一遍，还说到了他企图把双桅船炸毁的计划。","All immediately took refuge in the Chimneys.There Ayrton recounted all that had passed, even to his plan for blowing up the brig, which he had attempted to put into execution."
"大家都握住了艾尔通的手，而艾尔顿也毫不掩饰他们的处境非常危险。海盗们惊动了。他们知道林肯岛上有人居住。他们会全副武装，蜂拥而至。他们无法无天、肆无忌惮。移民们要是落入他们之手，就别指望他们大发慈悲！","All hands were extended to Ayrton, who did not conceal from them that their situation was serious.The pirates had been alarmed.They knew that Lincoln Island was inhabited.They would land upon it in numbers and well armed.They would respect nothing.Should the settlers fall into their hands, they must expect no mercy!"
"“好吧，我们拼了！”记者说。","“Well, we shall know how to die!” said the reporter."
"“我们进去观望吧。”工程师回答说。","“Let us go in and watch,” answered the engineer."
"“我们有机会逃脱吗，队长？”水手问道。","“Have we any chance of escape, captain?” asked the sailor."
"“有的，潘克洛夫。”","“Yes, Pencroft.”"
"“嗯！六对五十！”","“Hum! six against fifty!”"
"“对！六个！不包括……”","“Yes! six! without counting—”"
"“谁？”潘克洛夫问。","“Who?” asked Pencroft."
"赛勒斯没有回答，只是向上指了指。","Cyrus did not reply, but pointed upwards."
"第三章","Chapter 3"
"这一夜平安无事地过去了。移民们保持着高度警惕，一直没有离开“石窟”这个阵地中各自的岗位。至于海盗那一方，似乎没有任何上岸的企图。自从他们向艾尔顿开了最后一枪以后，就再也没开过枪了，甚至没有一点声音可以说明双桅船还在小岛附近。也许它想到将不得不和对手交战，所以已经拔锚起航，离开海岸了吧。","The night passed without incident.The colonists were on the qui vive, and did not leave their post at the Chimneys.The pirates, on their side, did not appear to have made any attempt to land.Since the last shots fired at Ayrton not a report, not even a sound, had betrayed the presence of the brig in the neighborhood of the island.It might have been fancied that she had weighed anchor, thinking that she had to deal with her match, and had left the coast."
"但是，事实并非如此，破晓的时候，移民们透过清晨的薄雾，可以看见一团朦胧的影子。那就是“飞快号”。","But it was no such thing, and when day began to dawn the settlers could see a confused mass through the morning mist.It was the “Speedy.”"
"“朋友们，”工程师说，“我认为，我们最好在大雾完全散开之前做好下面这些准备。雾可以使海盗看不见我们，这样，我们的行动就不会引起他们的注意。最重要的是，要让那些罪犯们以为岛上有很多居民，足以抵抗他们。因此，我建议把我们的人分成三组。第一组留在‘石窟’，第二组去慈悲河口防守。至于第三组，我认为最好安排在小岛上，以便阻止，至少也能拖延任何登陆的企图。我们有两支步枪和四支滑膛枪可用。每个人都能武装起来，我们有的是弹药，不必节省火力。我们既不怕双桅船上的滑膛枪，也不怕它的大炮。它们能把这些岩石怎么样呢？只要我们不从花岗石宫的窗口向外开枪，海盗们就想不到朝那里开炮，也不会给那里造成无可挽回的损失。我担心的是不得不和他们进行肉搏，因为罪犯的人数很多。所以，我们一定要设法阻止他们登陆，但又不能暴露自己。因此，大家不要节省弹药。要不停地射击，但要瞄准了以后再开枪。我们每个人要打死八到十个敌人，一定要把他们都消灭！”","“These, my friends,” said the engineer, “are the arrangements which appear to me best to make before the fog completely clears away.It hides us from the eyes of the pirates, and we can act without attracting their attention.The most important thing is, that the convicts should believe that the inhabitants of the island are numerous, and consequently capable of resisting them.I therefore propose that we divide into three parties.The first of which shall be posted at the Chimneys, the second at the mouth of the Mercy.As to the third, I think it would be best to place it on the islet, so as to prevent, or at all events delay, any attempt at landing.We have the use of two rifles and four muskets.Each of us will be armed, and, as we are amply provided with powder and shot, we need not spare our fire.We have nothing to fear from the muskets nor even from the guns of the brig.What can they do against these rocks?And, as we shall not fire from the windows of Granite House, the pirates will not think of causing irreparable damage by throwing shell against it.What is to be feared is, the necessity of meeting hand-to-hand, since the convicts have numbers on their side.We must therefore try to prevent them from landing, but without discovering ourselves.Therefore, do not economize the ammunition.Fire often, but with a sure aim.We have each eight or ten enemies to kill, and they must be killed!”"
"赛勒斯·哈丁把情况讲得很清楚，他的语气很镇定，就像是在调度一件工作，而不是在指挥一场战斗。他的同伴们都默默地同意了这个部署。现在要做的，只是在雾散尽之前各就各位。纳布和潘克洛夫立刻到花岗石宫，拿来了大量弹药。吉迪恩·史佩莱和艾尔顿都是射击高手，各自拿了一支射程有将近一英里的步枪。四支滑膛枪则分给了哈丁、纳布、潘克洛夫和赫伯特。","Cyrus Harding had clearly represented their situation, although he spoke in the calmest voice, as if it was a question of directing a piece of work and not ordering a battle.His companions approved these arrangements without even uttering a word.There was nothing more to be done but for each to take his place before the fog should be completely dissipated.Neb and Pencroft immediately ascended to Granite House and brought back a sufficient quantity of ammunition.Gideon Spilett and Ayrton, both very good marksmen, were armed with the two rifles, which carried nearly a mile.The four other muskets were divided among Harding, Neb, Pencroft, and Herbert."
"各人的阵地是如下这样布置的：","The posts were arranged in the following manner:—"
"赛勒斯·哈丁和赫伯特埋伏在“石窟”附近，负责把守花岗石宫下面的海岸。","Cyrus Harding and Herbert remained in ambush at the Chimneys, thus commanding the shore to the foot of Granite House."
"吉迪恩·史佩莱和纳布埋伏在慈悲河口的乱石丛中，河上的吊桥已经扯起来了，他们负责阻止任何人乘船渡河或在对岸登陆。","Gideon Spilett and Neb crouched among the rocks at the mouth of the Mercy, from which the drawbridges had been raised, so as to prevent any one from crossing in a boat or landing on the opposite shore."
"艾尔顿和潘克洛夫划小船渡过海峡，在小岛上分别占据一个阵地。这样，火力同时从四个不同的地点发射，就会让罪犯们认为岛上不但有许多居民，而且防守严密。","As to Ayrton and Pencroft, they shoved off in the boat, and prepared to cross the channel and to take up two separate stations on the islet.In this way, shots being fired from four different points at once, the convicts would be led to believe that the island was both largely peopled and strongly defended."
"如果艾尔顿和潘克洛夫无法阻止海盗们登陆，而且眼看就要被海盗们的小船切断退路，那他们应该乘船回到岸上来，到情况最紧急的地点去。","In the event of a landing being effected without their having been able to prevent it, and also if they saw that they were on the point of being cut off by the brig’s boat, Ayrton and Pencroft were to return in their boat to the shore and proceed towards the threatened spot."
"在出发去各自的阵地之前，移民们最后一次相互握手。","Before starting to occupy their posts, the colonists for the last time wrung each other’s hands."
"潘克洛夫成功地充分抑制住自己的感情，拥抱了他的孩子赫伯特，然后他们就分开了。","Pencroft succeeded in controlling himself sufficiently to suppress his emotion when he embraced Herbert, his boy! and then they separated."
"不一会儿，哈丁和赫伯特一路，以及记者和纳布那一路，都消失在了岩石后面，五分钟后，艾尔顿和潘克洛夫也顺利渡过了海峡，登上了小岛，隐藏在东岸的裂石中。","In a few moments Harding and Herbert on one side, the reporter and Neb on the other, had disappeared behind the rocks, and five minutes later Ayrton and Pencroft, having without difficulty crossed the channel, disembarked on the islet and concealed themselves in the clefts of its eastern shore."
"他们都没有被发现，因为连他们自己也只能隐约看到雾中的双桅船。","None of them could have been seen, for they themselves could scarcely distinguish the brig in the fog."
"这时候是早上六点半。","It was half-past six in the morning."
"不久雾就逐渐散开了，船的中桅从烟雾里露了出来。大片的烟雾在海面上滚动了几分钟，接着就被出现的微风迅速吹散了。","Soon the fog began to clear away, and the topmasts of the brig issued from the vapor.For some minutes great masses rolled over the surface of the sea, then a breeze sprang up, which rapidly dispelled the mist."
"“飞快号”完全显露了出来，它的锚链上系着一根绳索，船头朝北，左舷对着海岛。正如哈丁估计的那样，它距离海岸不超过一又四分之一英里。","The “Speedy” now appeared in full view, with a spring on her cable, her head to the north, presenting her larboard side to the island.Just as Harding had calculated, she was not more than a mile and a quarter from the coast."
"那面阴森森的黑旗仍在船顶飘着。","The sinister black flag floated from the peak."
"工程师从望远镜中看到，船上的四门大炮全都对着海岛。显然，只要一声令下，它们随时准备开火。","The engineer, with his telescope, could see that the four guns on board were pointed at the island.They were evidently ready to fire at a moment’s notice."
"这时候，“飞快号”一点动静也没有。只见三十来个海盗在甲板上走动着。有几个在船尾，另外有两个站在桅索中间，手中举着小型望远镜，正在仔细观察海岛。","In the meanwhile the “Speedy” remained silent.About thirty pirates could be seen moving on the deck.A few more on the poop; two others posted in the shrouds, and armed with spyglasses, were attentively surveying the island."
"显然，鲍勃·哈维和他的同伙们都对昨天夜里发生在双桅船上的事感到难以理解。那个半裸的男人强行打开了火药库的门，和他们进行了搏斗，并且用自己的左轮手枪向他们开了六枪，打死了一人，打伤了两个，最后这个人被打死了吗？他泅水回到岸上去了吗？他是从哪里来的？他有什么目的？难道他真像鲍勃·哈维所想的那样，想炸毁双桅船吗？这些问题一定足以使罪犯们摸不着头脑。不过有一点他们可以肯定，那就是“飞快号”前面的那座无名海岛上有人居住，而且那里可能有许多移民已经准备好保卫它了。可是，不论是海岸上还是山岗上，他们连一个人都看不到。海滩上似乎完全没有人。至少没有任何房屋的痕迹。难道居民们都逃到小岛深处去了吗？海盗船长也许就是这样想的，并且，毫无疑问，作为一个谨慎的人，在让他的部下去冒险之前，他希望先侦察一下岛上的情况。","Certainly, Bob Harvey and his crew would not be able easily to give an account of what had happened during the night on board the brig.Had this half-naked man, who had forced the door of the powder-magazine, and with whom they had struggled, who had six times discharged his revolver at them, who had killed one and wounded two others, escaped their shot?Had he been able to swim to shore?Whence did he come?What had been his object?Had his design really been to blow up the brig, as Bob Harvey had thought?All this must be confused enough to the convicts’ minds.But what they could no longer doubt was that the unknown island before which the “Speedy” had cast anchor was inhabited, and that there was, perhaps, a numerous colony ready to defend it.And yet no one was to be seen, neither on the shore, nor on the heights.The beach appeared to be absolutely deserted.At any rate, there was no trace of dwellings.Had the inhabitants fled into the interior?Thus probably the pirate captain reasoned, and doubtless, like a prudent man, he wished to reconnoiter the locality before he allowed his men to venture there."
"一个半小时过去了，双桅船还是没有任何进攻或登陆的迹象。鲍勃·哈维显然是在犹豫不决。即使是用倍数最大的望远镜，他也看不到一个埋伏在岩石中的移民。虽然遮盖花岗石宫窗口的绿枝和爬藤，在光秃秃的岩石上十分显眼，但这也许根本就没有引起他的注意。的确，他怎么想得到在这样高的地方，会有人在坚硬的花岗石中间挖出一座房屋来呢？从爪角到颚骨角，包括整个联合湾在内，没有任何迹象能使他认为岛上有人或可能有人。","During an hour and a half, no indication of attack or landing could be observed on board the brig.Evidently Bob Harvey was hesitating.Even with his strongest telescopes he could not have perceived one of the settlers crouched among the rocks.It was not even probable that his attention had been awakened by the screen of green branches and creepers hiding the windows of Granite House, and showing rather conspicuously on the bare rock.Indeed, how could he imagine that a dwelling was hollowed out, at that height, in the solid granite?From Claw Cape to the Mandible Capes, in all the extent of Union Bay, there was nothing to lead him to suppose that the island was or could be inhabited."
"八点钟的时候，移民们终于看见“飞快号”上有行动了。一艘小艇放了下来，七个人跳了进去。他们都带着滑膛枪；一个人掌舵，四个人划桨，另外两个人身体弯成弓形跪在船头，侦察岛上的动静，随时准备开火。他们的目的很明显，是要做一次侦察，而不是登陆，否则的话，来的人会更多。海盗们从他们的了望台上可以看到，海岸由一个小岛掩护着，两者之间有一条宽约半英里的海峡。但是，根据小艇行驶的方向，赛勒斯·哈丁明显看出，他们并不打算进入海峡，而是要在小岛上登陆。","At eight o’clock, however, the colonists observed a movement on board the “Speedy.”A boat was lowered, and seven men jumped into her.They were armed with muskets; one took the yoke-lines, four others the oars, and the two others, kneeling in the bows, ready to fire, reconnoitered the island.Their object was no doubt to make an examination but not to land, for in the latter case they would have come in larger numbers.The pirates from their look-out could have seen that the coast was sheltered by an islet, separated from it by a channel half a mile in width.However, it was soon evident to Cyrus Harding, on observing the direction followed by the boat, that they would not attempt to penetrate into the channel, but would land on the islet."
"潘克洛夫和艾尔顿各自躲在狭窄的岩石缝里，看着小艇径直朝他们驶来，等着它进入射程以内。","Pencroft and Ayrton, each hidden in a narrow cleft of the rock, saw them coming directly towards them, and waited till they were within range."
"小艇小心翼翼地前进着。罪犯们隔很长时间才划一次桨。现在可以看见，一个罪犯手里拿着铅垂线，想要测量受慈悲河水冲刷的海峡有多深。这表明鲍勃·哈维打算将双桅船尽量靠近海岸。船上的三十来个海盗分散在索具中间，注视着小艇的动向，并试图发现能让他们安全上岸的界标。小艇在距小岛不到两链远的地方停下来了。掌舵的罪犯站起身来，寻找着最适合上岸的地方。","The boat advanced with extreme caution.The oars only dipped into the water at long intervals.It could now be seen that one of the convicts held a lead-line in his hand, and that he wished to fathom the depth of the channel hollowed out by the current of the Mercy.This showed that it was Bob Harvey’s intention to bring his brig as near as possible to the coast.About thirty pirates, scattered in the rigging, followed every movement of the boat, and took the bearings of certain landmarks which would allow them to approach without danger.The boat was not more than two cables-lengths off the islet when she stopped.The man at the tiller stood up and looked for the best place at which to land."
"这时候听见两声枪响。一缕轻烟从小岛的岩石中间袅袅上升。掌舵和测量水深的海盗仰面倒在了小艇里。艾尔顿和潘克洛夫的子弹同时击中了他们。","At that moment two shots were heard.Smoke curled up from among the rocks of the islet.The man at the helm and the man with the lead-line fell backwards into the boat.Ayrton’s and Pencroft’s balls had struck them both at the same moment."
"几乎与此同时，又听见一声更大的炮响，双桅船的船舷喷出一团烟雾，一颗炮弹落在艾尔顿和潘克洛夫藏身的岩石顶上，炸得碎石横飞，不过两名枪手都没有受伤。","Almost immediately a louder report was heard, a cloud of smoke issued from the brig’s side, and a ball, striking the summit of the rock which sheltered Ayrton and Pencroft, made it fly in splinters, but the two marksmen remained unhurt."
"小艇上的海盗们爆发出可怕的叫骂声，立刻继续将小艇向前驶来。另一个海盗接替了掌舵的位置，其他人则奋力快速划桨。不过，出乎意料的是，小艇不但没有掉头回去，反而沿着海岸驶来，打算绕过小岛的南端。海盗们拼命划着桨，想逃出步枪的射程。","Horrible imprecations burst from the boat, which immediately continued its way.The man who had been at the tiller was replaced by one of his comrades, and the oars were rapidly plunged into the water.However, instead of returning on board as might have been expected, the boat coasted along the islet, so as to round its southern point.The pirates pulled vigorously at their oars that they might get out of range of the bullets."
"他们就这样一直把小艇划到距离遗物角岸边五链以内的地方，然后绕了半圈，继续在双桅船大炮的掩护下，向慈悲河口驶去。","They advanced to within five cables-lengths of that part of the shore terminated by Flotsam Point, and after having rounded it in a semicircular line, still protected by the brig’s guns, they proceeded towards the mouth of the Mercy."
"他们的意图显然是想进入海峡，切断岛上移民的退路，这样一来，无论小岛上有多少人，他们都将处于小艇和双桅船两船火力夹击的十分不利的位置。","Their evident intention was to penetrate into the channel, and cut off the colonists posted on the islet, in such a way, that whatever their number might be, being placed between the fire from the boat and the fire from the brig, they would find themselves in a very disadvantageous position."
"小艇朝这个方向前进了十五分钟。周围万籁俱寂，海面上也风平浪静。","A quarter of an hour passed while the boat advanced in this direction.Absolute silence, perfect calm reigned in the air and on the water."
"虽然潘克洛夫和艾尔顿知道有被切断退路的危险，但他们没有离开阵地，他们不愿在敌人和“飞快号”的炮火前暴露自己；同时他们也相信守卫在河口的纳布和吉迪恩·史佩莱，以及埋伏在“石窟”附近岩石丛中的赛勒斯·哈丁和赫伯特会援助他们。","Pencroft and Ayrton, although they knew they ran the risk of being cut off, had not left their post, both that they did not wish to show themselves as yet to their assailants, and expose themselves to the “Speedy’s” guns, and that they relied on Neb and Gideon Spilett, watching at the mouth of the river, and on Cyrus Harding and Herbert, in ambush among the rocks at the Chimneys."
"在开第一枪后二十分钟，小艇已经到了离慈悲河不到两链远的地方。这时候正开始涨潮，由于海峡十分狭窄，水势依然非常湍急，把海盗们的小艇冲到了河口，他们只是通过奋力划桨，才得以把小艇保持在海峡的中央。但是，当他们驶进慈悲河口阵地的射程内，立刻遭到两颗子弹的迎击，又有两个人倒下了。纳布和史佩莱的子弹都没有落空。","Twenty minutes after the first shots were fired, the boat was less than two cables-lengths off the Mercy.As the tide was beginning to rise with its accustomed violence, caused by the narrowness of the straits, the pirates were drawn towards the river, and it was only by dint of hard rowing that they were able to keep in the middle of the channel.But, as they were passing within good range of the mouth of the Mercy, two balls saluted them, and two more of their number were laid in the bottom of the boat.Neb and Spilett had not missed their aim."
"双桅船对着冒烟的阵地又开了一炮，但除了打碎几块石头外，没有任何收获。","The brig immediately sent a second ball on the post betrayed by the smoke, but without any other result than that of splintering the rock."
"现在小艇上只剩下三个完好无损的人了。顺着水流，它像箭一般冲过了海峡，来到哈丁和赫伯特的阵地面前，他们两人认为还不到射程之内，就没开枪，小艇上的人划着仅剩的双桨，绕过小岛的北端，回到双桅船那里去了。","The boat now contained only three able men.Carried on by the current, it shot through the channel with the rapidity of an arrow, passed before Harding and Herbert, who, not thinking it within range, withheld their fire, then, rounding the northern point of the islet with the two remaining oars, they pulled towards the brig."
"到目前为止，移民们还没什么可抱怨的。可他们的敌人却显然遇到了最坏的情况。他们已经有四个人即使没死，也受了重伤；相反，移民们非但没有受伤，而且弹无虚发。要是海盗们继续这样进攻，还打算利用小艇登陆的话，那么，他们只能是一个一个地被杀掉。","Hitherto the settlers had nothing to complain of.Their adversaries had certainly had the worst of it.The latter already counted four men seriously wounded if not dead; they, on the contrary, unwounded, had not missed a shot.If the pirates continued to attack them in this way, if they renewed their attempt to land by means of a boat, they could be destroyed one by one."
"现在大家明白工程师的部署是多么有利了。海盗们会以为对手人多势众，装备精良，想要取胜没那么容易。","It was now seen how advantageous the engineer’s arrangements had been.The pirates would think that they had to deal with numerous and well-armed adversaries, whom they could not easily get the better of."
"小艇和海潮搏斗了半个小时，才靠上了“飞快号”。小艇上的海盗和伤员回到船上时，传来了一阵可怕的嚎叫，接着又毫无结果地开了两三炮。","Half an hour passed before the boat, having to pull against the current, could get alongside the “Speedy.”Frightful cries were heard when they returned on board with the wounded, and two or three guns were fired with no results."
"但是，现在又有十来个气得发疯的罪犯跳上小艇，也许他们还没有从前一夜的畅饮中清醒过来。同时，又放下第二艘小艇，里面坐着八个人，第一只小艇径直朝小岛扑去，企图赶走岛上的移民，而第二艘则打算强行进入慈悲河口。","But now about a dozen other convicts, maddened with rage, and possibly by the effect of the evening’s potations, threw themselves into the boat.A second boat was also lowered, in which eight men took their places, and while the first pulled straight for the islet, to dislodge the colonists from thence the second maneuvered so as to force the entrance of the Mercy."
"这种情况对潘克洛夫和艾尔顿显然极为不利，他们知道非回到岛上不可了。","The situation was evidently becoming very dangerous for Pencroft and Ayrton, and they saw that they must regain the mainland."
"但是，他们仍然等到第一艘小艇进入射程范围，然后准确地开了两枪，使艇上的人陷入一片混乱。潘克洛夫和艾尔通这才离开了各自的岗位，他们冒着来自十几支滑膛枪的枪林弹雨，以最快的速度穿过小岛，跳进小船，在第二艘小艇到达南端的时候渡过了海峡，藏到“石窟”里去了。","However, they waited till the first boat was within range, when two well-directed balls threw its crew into disorder.Then, Pencroft and Ayrton, abandoning their posts, under fire from the dozen muskets, ran across the islet at full speed, jumped into their boat, crossed the channel at the moment the second boat reached the southern end, and ran to hide themselves in the Chimneys."
"他们刚同赛勒斯·哈丁和赫伯特会合，海盗们就占据了小岛各处。几乎与此同时，慈悲河口的阵地上也传来了枪声，第二艘小艇也迅速向那里靠拢。船上的八个人当中，有两个遭到了吉迪恩·史佩莱和纳布的致命打击而负伤，而小船本身则因失去控制，撞上了礁石，在慈悲河口处，小船就被撞破了。但是，那六个幸存的罪犯把滑膛枪举过头顶，以防浸水，登上了河的右岸。他们发现自己暴露在埋伏阵地的火力范围之内，于是就拼命朝枪弹打不到的遗物角逃去了。","They had scarcely rejoined Cyrus Harding and Herbert, before the islet was overrun with pirates in every direction.Almost at the same moment, fresh reports resounded from the Mercy station, to which the second boat was rapidly approaching.Two, out of the eight men who manned her, were mortally wounded by Gideon Spilett and Neb, and the boat herself, carried irresistibly onto the reefs, was stove in at the mouth of the Mercy.But the six survivors, holding their muskets above their heads to preserve them from contact with the water, managed to land on the right bank of the river.Then, finding they were exposed to the fire of the ambush there, they fled in the direction of Flotsam Point, out of range of the balls."
"实际情况是这样的：小岛上有十二名罪犯，其中有几个肯定是受伤了，但他们还有一艘小艇。六名罪犯上了孤岛，但他们无法到花岗石宫去，因为吊桥已经被扯起来了，他们过不了河。","The actual situation was this: on the islet were a dozen convicts, of whom some were no doubt wounded, but who had still a boat at their disposal; on the island were six, but who could not by any possibility reach Granite House, as they could not cross the river, all the bridges being raised."
"“嘿，”潘克洛夫冲进“石窟”，大声叫道，“嘿，队长！你认为现在该怎么办？”","“Hallo,” exclaimed Pencroft as he rushed into the Chimneys, “hallo, captain!What do you think of it, now?”"
"“我想，”工程师回答说，“战斗现在进入了一个新的局面，因为罪犯们不会这么傻，会甘愿处于对他们不利的境地！”","“I think,” answered the engineer, “that the combat will now take a new form, for it cannot be supposed that the convicts will be so foolish as to remain in a position so unfavorable for them!”"
"“他们渡不过海峡的，”水手说，“有艾尔顿和史佩莱先生的步枪挡在那里。你知道，这些步枪可以打到一英里以外的地方！”","“They won’t cross the channel,” said the sailor.“Ayrton and Mr. Spilett’s rifles are there to prevent them.You know that they carry more than a mile!”"
"“当然，”赫伯特答道，“但是，两支步枪怎么能对抗双桅船上的大炮呢？”","“No doubt,” replied Herbert; “but what can two rifles do against the brig’s guns?”"
"“嗯，我想，双桅船还没有开进海峡吧！”潘克洛夫说。","“Well, the brig isn’t in the channel yet, I fancy!” said Pencroft."
"“但要是它开进来了呢？”哈丁说。","“But suppose she does come there?” said Harding."
"“那不可能，要是那样做，它可能要冒着搁浅，甚至沉没的风险！”","“That’s impossible, for she would risk running aground and being lost!”"
"“还是有可能的，”艾尔顿说，“罪犯们会乘着涨潮把船开进海峡，哪怕是冒着在落潮时船会搁浅的风险，那时候，在它的炮火下，我们的阵地就守不住了。”","“It is possible,” said Ayrton.“The convicts might profit by the high tide to enter the channel, with the risk of grounding at low tide, it is true; but then, under the fire from her guns, our posts would be no longer tenable.”"
"“打败他们！”潘克洛夫叫道，“这帮恶棍似乎真的在准备起锚了。”","“Confound them!” exclaimed Pencroft, “it really seems as if the blackguards were preparing to weigh anchor.”"
"“也许我们只好躲到‘花岗石宫’里去了！”赫伯特评论道。","“Perhaps we shall be obliged to take refuge in Granite House!” observed Herbert."
"“我们得再等一会儿！”赛勒斯·哈丁说。","“We must wait!” answered Cyrus Harding."
"“可史佩莱先生和纳布怎么办？”潘克洛夫问道。","“But Mr. Spilett and Neb?” said Pencroft."
"“他们知道什么时候应该来和我们会合的准备好，艾尔顿。现在该轮到你和史佩莱的步枪上场了。”","“They will know when it is best to rejoin us.Be ready, Ayrton.It is yours and Spilett’s rifles which must speak now.”"
"果不其然。“飞快号”开始起锚了，它显然打算驶进小岛。潮水还要上涨一个半小时，退潮的水流也已经减弱，在这种情况下，双桅船前进起来非常容易。不过，潘克洛夫不同意艾尔顿的看法，他认为双桅船不敢开进海峡。","It was only too true.The “Speedy” was beginning to weigh her anchor, and her intention was evidently to approach the islet.The tide would be rising for an hour and a half, and the ebb current being already weakened, it would be easy for the brig to advance.But as to entering the channel, Pencroft, contrary to Ayrton’s opinion, could not believe that she would dare to attempt it."
"这时候，占领了小岛的海盗们逐渐来到对面的海岸上，和主岛只一峡之隔了。","In the meanwhile, the pirates who occupied the islet had gradually advanced to the opposite shore, and were now only separated from the mainland by the channel."
"海盗们只有滑膛枪，因此伤不了埋伏在“石窟”和慈悲河口的移民，他们想不到移民们配有远射程的步枪，因此以为自己还没有暴露在对方的火力之下。于是，他们不加掩护地搜查小岛，巡视海岸。","Being armed with muskets alone, they could do no harm to the settlers, in ambush at the Chimneys and the mouth of the Mercy; but, not knowing the latter to be supplied with long-range rifles, they on their side did not believe themselves to be exposed.Quite uncovered, therefore, they surveyed the islet, and examined the shore."
"他们的幻想很快就破灭了。艾尔顿和吉迪恩·史佩莱的步枪开火了，无疑给罪犯们带来了最不幸的消息，其中两个仰面倒了下去。","Their illusion was of short duration.Ayrton’s and Gideon Spilett’s rifles then spoke, and no doubt imparted some very disagreeable intelligence to two of the convicts, for they fell backwards."
"于是，所有的罪犯们都惊慌失措。其余的十个人甚至顾不上带上伤亡的伙伴，便逃到小岛的另一边了，跌跌撞撞地爬上来时乘坐的小艇，拼命划走了。","Then there was a general helter-skelter.The ten others, not even stopping to pick up their dead or wounded companions, fled to the other side of the islet, tumbled into the boat which had brought them, and pulled away with all their strength."
"“又少了八个！”潘克洛夫喊道，“的确，史佩莱先生和艾尔顿同时开枪，简直好像听了口令似的！”","“Eight less!” exclaimed Pencroft.“Really, one would have thought that Mr. Spilett and Ayrton had given the word to fire together!”"
"“先生们，”艾尔顿一边给步枪装子弹，一边说，“情况更加严重了。双桅船准备启动了！”","“Gentlemen,” said Ayrton, as he reloaded his gun, “this is becoming more serious.The brig is making sail!”"
"“它在起锚呢！”潘克洛夫叫道。","“The anchor is weighed!” exclaimed Pencroft."
"“是的，它已经启动了。”","“Yes, and she is already moving.”"
"事实上，他们已经能够清楚地听见绞盘的声音了。“飞快号”先是被锚拉住的，等起锚以后，它就开始向岸边漂过来了。风从海面上吹来，船上张起了三角帆和前桅帆，并逐渐向主岛逼近。","In fact, they could distinctly hear the creaking of the windlass.The “Speedy” was at first held by her anchor; then, when that had been raised, she began to drift towards the shore.The wind was blowing from the sea; the jib and the foretopsail were hoisted, and the vessel gradually approached the island."
"大家从慈悲河和“石窟”这两个阵地上观察双桅船，他们的身子虽然纹丝不动，心里却十分激动。要是在这么短的距离内暴露在双桅船的火炮底下，而无法给予有效的回击，那移民们的处境该会多可怕？他们怎样才能阻止海盗们登陆呢？","From the two posts of the Mercy and the Chimneys they watched her without giving a sign of life, but not without some emotion.What could be more terrible for the colonists than to be exposed, at a short distance, to the brig’s guns, without being able to reply with any effect?How could they then prevent the pirates from landing?"
"赛勒斯·哈丁充分意识到这一点，他思考着对策。他必须很快作出决定。可是该怎样决定呢？撤到花岗石宫里困守，凭着那里充足的食物储备，坚持几个星期，甚至是几个月吗？这样固然可以！但以后呢？海盗们还是会成为孤岛的主人，他们会恣意蹂躏它，总有一天，他们终将报复被困在花岗石宫里的人。","Cyrus Harding felt this strongly, and he asked himself what it would be possible to do.Before long, he would be called upon for his determination.But what was it to be?To shut themselves up in Granite House, to be besieged there, to remain there for weeks, for months even, since they had an abundance of provisions?So far good!But after that?The pirates would not the less be masters of the island, which they would ravage at their pleasure, and in time, they would end by having their revenge on the prisoners in Granite House."
"不过，他们还有一线希望，那就是——鲍勃·哈维也许不会冒险把船开进海峡，而只是停在小岛外面。这样的话，双桅船离海岸还有半英里远，隔着这段距离开炮，造成的损失不会太大。","However, one chance yet remained; it was that Bob Harvey, after all, would not venture his ship into the channel, and that he would keep outside the islet.He would be still separated from the coast by half a mile, and at that distance his shot could not be very destructive."
"“决不会的！”潘克洛夫不停地说，“要是鲍勃·哈维是一名出色的水手，他就决不会到海峡里来！他清楚地知道一旦退潮，双桅船就会有危险！没有了船，他该怎么办呢？”","“Never!” repeated Pencroft, “Bob Harvey will never, if he is a good seaman, enter that channel!He knows well that it would risk the brig, if the sea got up ever so little!And what would become of him without his vessel?”"
"这时候，双桅船已经靠近小岛了，看得出它正努力向下驶去。风力很小，海潮的力量也大大减弱了，鲍勃·哈维可以随心所欲地操纵他的船。","In the meanwhile the brig approached the islet, and it could be seen that she was endeavoring to make the lower end.The breeze was light, and as the current had then lost much of its force, Bob Harvey had absolute command over his vessel."
"由于先前小艇走过这条航线，这就便于侦察海峡，于是它大胆地开进了海峡。","The route previously followed by the boats had allowed her to reconnoiter the channel, and she boldly entered it."
"现在海盗们的意图非常明显：他打算把舷侧炮火对准“石窟”，开炮还击那些打死他们同伙的枪弹。","The pirate’s design was now only too evident; he wished to bring her broadside to bear on the Chimneys and from there to reply with shell and ball to the shot which had till then decimated her crew."
"不一会儿，“飞快号”就来到了小岛顶端，轻松地绕了过去，船上扯起主帆，吃足了风，朝慈悲河口驶来。","Soon the “Speedy” reached the point of the islet; she rounded it with ease; the mainsail was braced up, and the brig hugging the wind, stood across the mouth of the Mercy."
"“这些恶棍！他们来了！”潘克洛夫叫道。","“The scoundrels! they are coming!” said Pencroft."
"这时候，纳布和吉迪恩·史佩莱回到了赛勒斯·哈丁、艾尔顿、水手和赫伯特这里。","At that moment, Cyrus Harding, Ayrton, the sailor, and Herbert, were rejoined by Neb and Gideon Spilett."
"记者和他的同伴认为应该放弃慈悲河的阵地，因为在那里他们没有任何办法可以对付双桅船，于是他们就明智地撤退了。在即将采取决定性行动的时候，移民们最好还是团结在一起。吉迪恩·史佩莱和纳布躲在岩石后面跑了回来，遭到了一阵射击，不过毫发无损。","The reporter and his companion had judged it best to abandon the post at the Mercy, from which they could do nothing against the ship, and they had acted wisely.It was better that the colonists should be together at the moment when they were about to engage in a decisive action.Gideon Spilett and Neb had arrived by dodging behind the rocks, though not without attracting a shower of bullets, which had not, however, reached them."
"“史佩莱！纳布！”工程师喊道，“你们没有受伤吧？”","“Spilett!Neb!” cried the engineer.“You are not wounded?”"
"“没有，”记者回答说，“只是子弹跳起来擦伤了点儿！但那该死的船已经开进了海峡！”","“No,” answered the reporter, “a few bruises only from the ricochet!But that cursed brig has entered the channel!”"
"“是的，”潘克洛夫答道，“再过十分钟，它就会停在花岗石宫前面了！”","“Yes,” replied Pencroft, “and in ten minutes she will have anchored before Granite House!”"
"“你有什么计划吗，赛勒斯？”记者问道。","“Have you formed any plan, Cyrus?” asked the reporter."
"“趁现在还来得及，我们必须躲到花岗石宫里去，罪犯们看不见我们。”","“We must take refuge in Granite House while there is still time, and the convicts cannot see us.”"
"“我同意，”吉迪恩·史佩莱说，“可一旦被困在里面……”","“That is, my opinion, too,” replied Gideon Spilett, “but once shut up—”"
"“我们到时候再见机行事吧。”工程师说。","“We must be guided by circumstances,” said the engineer."
"“那就赶快走吧！”记者说。","“Let us be off, then, and make haste!” said the reporter."
"“队长，要我和艾尔顿留在这里吗？”水手问道。","“Would you not wish, captain, that Ayrton and I should remain here?” asked the sailor."
"“留下来又有什么用呢，潘克洛夫？”哈丁回答说。“不。我们不要分开！”","“What would be the use of that, Pencroft?” replied Harding.“No.We will not separate!”"
"现在一秒钟都不能耽搁了。移民们离开了“石窟”。弯曲的岩石遮挡着他们，使他们没有被双桅船上的人发现，不过从两三声枪响和子弹打在岩石上的声音可以判断，“飞快号”离他们已经不远了。","There was not a moment to be lost.The colonists left the Chimneys.A bend of the cliff prevented them from being seen by those in the brig, but two or three reports, and the crash of bullets on the rock, told them that the “Speedy” was at no great distance."
"仅一分钟的工夫，移民们就跳进升降机，上升到“花岗石宫'的门口，然后冲进了大厅。前一天晚上，托普和贾普就被关在了这里。","To spring into the lift, hoist themselves up to the door of Granite House, where Top and Jup had been shut up since the evening before, to rush into the large room, was the work of a minute only."
"他们回来得正是时候，移民们透过树枝，可以看见“飞快号”在缭绕的烟雾中驶进了海峡。枪声不停地响着，四门大炮朝已经无人把守的慈悲河阵地和“石窟”盲目地轰击。岩石被炸得四处横飞，每开一炮，海盗们就要欢呼一阵。幸亏哈丁想到把窗户遮蔽起来，所以大家还能指望”花岗石宫“不遭到炮击，可这时候，一颗炮弹射穿了门，打进走廊里来。","It was quite time, for the settlers, through the branches, could see the “Speedy,” surrounded with smoke, gliding up the channel.The firing was incessant, and shot from the four guns struck blindly, both on the Mercy post, although it was not occupied, and on the Chimneys.The rocks were splintered, and cheers accompanied each discharge.However, they were hoping that Granite House would be spared, thanks to Harding’s precaution of concealing the windows when a shot, piercing the door, penetrated into the passage."
"“我们被发现了！”潘克洛夫喊道。","“We are discovered!” exclaimed Pencroft."
"也许移民们还没有被发现，但可以肯定的是：鲍勃·哈维认为遮蔽在这部分峭壁上的树枝有些可疑，有必要朝它开上一炮。紧接着，他又加强了进攻，第二颗炮弹撕开了树枝的伪装，使花岗石壁上的洞口暴露无遗。","The colonists had not, perhaps, been seen, but it was certain that Bob Harvey had thought proper to send a ball through the suspected foliage which concealed that part of the cliff.Soon he redoubled his attack, when another ball having torn away the leafy screen, disclosed a gaping aperture in the granite."
"移民们陷入了绝境。他们的撤退已经被发现了。他们既无法阻挡这些炮弹，又不能保护这片石壁——在炮火的攻击下，碎石在他们周围飞溅四射。现在他们只能躲到花岗石宫的上层甬道里去，任凭自己的住所遭炮火的摧残。这时，突然传来一声巨响，接着便是一阵凄惨的叫声。","The colonists’ situation was desperate.Their retreat was discovered.They could not oppose any obstacle to these missiles, nor protect the stone, which flew in splinters around them.There was nothing to be done but to take refuge in the upper passage of Granite House, and leave their dwelling to be devastated, when a deep roar was heard, followed by frightful cries!"
"赛勒斯·哈丁和同伴们忙冲到窗边……","Cyrus Harding and his companions rushed to one of the windows—"
"只见双桅船被一股势不可挡的水柱掀了起来，然后一分为二，不到十秒钟，就和船上的罪犯们一起沉入了海里！","The brig, irresistibly raised on a sort of water-spout, had just split in two, and in less than ten seconds she was swallowed up with all her criminal crew!"
"第四章","Chapter 4"
"“船爆炸了！”赫伯特喊。","“She has blown up!” cried Herbert."
"“真的！炸了！就像艾尔顿真的点着了火药一样！”潘克洛夫从窗口那边过来，跟纳布和少年一齐跳进了升降梯。","“Yes! blown up, just as if Ayrton had set fire to the powder!” returned Pencroft, throwing himself into the lift together with Neb and the lad."
"“究竟是怎么回事？”吉迪恩·史佩莱问，这个意想不到的突发事件让他感到非常吃惊。","“But what has happened?” asked Gideon Spilett, quite stunned by this unexpected catastrophe."
"“嗯！这下我们就会知道了……”工程师立即说。","“Oh! this time, we shall know—” answered the engineer quickly."
"“知道什么……”","“What shall we know?—”"
"“再等等吧！再等等！走吧，史佩莱。重要的是海盗都被歼灭了！”","“Later! later!Come, Spilett.The main point is that these pirates have been exterminated!”"
"赛勒斯·哈丁催促着通讯记者和艾尔顿，三人跟着潘克洛夫、纳布和赫伯特一块儿来到了海滩。","And Cyrus Harding, hurrying away the reporter and Ayrton, joined Pencroft, Neb, and Herbert on the beach."
"整艘双桅船被炸得面目全非　，连桅杆也看不见。当时船被水柱抛到空中，往一边倒下去，然后就这样沉没了，显然是因为一些地方漏水很严重。不过，这一带的海峡至多有20英尺深，所以，沉船的船帮肯定能在水浅的地方露出来。","Nothing could be seen of the brig, not even her masts.After having been raised by the water-spout, she had fallen on her side, and had sunk in that position, doubtless in consequence of some enormous leak.But as in that place the channel was not more than twenty feet in depth, it was certain that the sides of the submerged brig would reappear at low water."
"沉船上的一些东西漂浮在水面上，其中有一只木筏，上面搁着不用的圆材，还有家禽笼子——里面的家禽还是活的——箱子和木桶，这些都从舱口漂出来，慢慢浮到了水面上。可是，沉船的残骸，不管是甲板上的厚板材，还是船体的木材，却一丁点儿也看不到，这让人觉得飞快号的突然失踪实在太不可思议。","A few things from the wreck floated on the surface of the water, a raft could be seen consisting of spare spars, coops of poultry with their occupants still living, boxes and barrels, which gradually came to the surface, after having escaped through the hatchways, but no pieces of the wreck appeared, neither planks from the deck, nor timber from the hull,—which rendered the sudden disappearance of the “Speedy” perfectly inexplicable."
"不过，两根折断的桅杆还是挣脱了左右支索的纠缠，漂了上来，桅杆上头还挂着帆，有的卷着边，有的伸展开来。艾尔顿和潘克洛夫等不及潮水把沉船上的财物冲上来，就跳进小船，想把沉船的残骸拖上海岸或是小岛。可是，正当他们要划船离开的时候，吉丁·史佩莱的一个问题却把他们问住了。","However, the two masts, which had been broken and escaped from the shrouds and stays came up, and with their sails, some furled and the others spread.But it was not necessary to wait for the tide to bring up these riches, and Ayrton and Pencroft jumped into the boat with the intention of towing the pieces of wreck either to the beach or to the islet.But just as they were shoving off, an observation from Gideon Spilett arrested them."
"“在慈悲河右岸登陆的那六个罪犯上哪儿去了？”吉迪恩·史佩莱说。","“What about those six convicts who disembarked on the right bank of the Mercy?” said he."
"大伙确实得提防一下，那六个罪犯乘的船虽然已经被岩石撞了个稀碎，可他们已经在遗物角上岸了。","In fact, it would not do to forget that the six men whose boat had gone to pieces on the rocks had landed at Flotsam Point."
"大伙儿往那个方向望去。一个罪犯也看不到。或许，这帮家伙看见他们的船在海峡里沉没了，便逃到荒岛的内陆去了。","They looked in that direction.None of the fugitives were visible.It was probable that, having seen their vessel engulfed in the channel, they had fled into the interior of the island."
"“我们以后再去对付那帮家伙，”哈丁说,“那帮罪犯身上有武器，因此遇上他们依然是件很危险的事，不过，现在我们和他们都是六个人，每一方都有一半赢的把握。先着手去办眼下最要紧的事吧。”","“We will deal with them later,” said Harding.“As they are armed, they will still be dangerous; but as it is six against six, the chances are equal.To the most pressing business first.”"
"艾尔顿和潘克洛夫奋力朝沉船划去。","Ayrton and Pencroft pulled vigorously towards the wreck."
"海面很平静，因为两天前才是新月，所以潮水非常高。至少还要过一个小时，双桅船的船体才能从海峡的水面露出来。","The sea was calm and the tide very high, as there had been a new moon but two days before.A whole hour at least would elapse before the hull of the brig could emerge from the water of the channel."
"艾尔顿和潘克洛夫用绳子绑住桅杆和圆材，然后把绳子的一头带到海岸上来。移民们一块儿使劲，终于把沉船的残骸拉了上来。接下来，艾尔顿和潘克洛夫又划着小船把漂在水面上的笼子、木桶、箱子打捞上来，然后立马把这些东西送回了“石窟”。","Ayrton and Pencroft were able to fasten the masts and spars by means of ropes, the ends of which were carried to the beach.There, by the united efforts of the settlers the pieces of wreck were hauled up.Then the boat picked up all that was floating, coops, barrels, and boxes, which were immediately carried to the Chimneys."
"几具尸体也浮出了水面。艾尔顿认出当中一个就是鲍勃·哈维，他指着那具尸体，激动地对同伴说道：","Several bodies floated also.Among them, Ayrton recognized that of Bob Harvey, which he pointed out to his companion, saying with some emotion,—"
"“我以前也和这个家伙一样，潘克洛夫。”","“That is what I have been, Pencroft.”"
"“可是你现在不一样了，勇敢的艾尔顿！”水手热情地回应。","“But what you are no longer, brave Ayrton!” returned the sailor warmly."
"令人觉得奇怪的是，只有寥寥几具尸体漂在水面上。他们数了数，统共才有五六具，这些尸体就要被水流冲到大海里了。很可能还没等罪犯们逃出去，船就朝一边沉了，因此大部分的人都被压在了下面。现在，水流就要把这些可悲的人的尸体冲到大海里了，这倒是给移民们省去了一件伤心的麻烦事——免得还要在荒岛上找什么角落把尸体埋起来。","It was singular enough that so few bodies floated.Only five or six were counted, which were already being carried by the current towards the open sea.Very probably the convicts had not had time to escape, and the ship lying over on her side, the greater number of them had remained below.Now the current, by carrying the bodies of these miserable men out to sea, would spare the colonists the sad task of burying them in some corner of their island."
"赛勒斯·哈丁和同伴们花了两个钟头的时间，把圆材拖到沙地上来，又把船上完好无损的帆展开来晒干。因为大伙儿都在一门心思地干活，所以很少交谈，但他们的脑子却被这样那样的想法占据着。","For two hours, Cyrus Harding and his companions were solely occupied in hauling up the spars on to the sand, and then in spreading the sails which were perfectly uninjured, to dry.They spoke little, for they were absorbed in their work, but what thoughts occupied their minds!"
"拥有这艘双桅船，或者说，拥有船上装载的所有物品，是一笔无比巨大的财富。的确，一艘船就好比一个小世界，殖民地的仓库因此又会增加大量有用的物品。它简直跟在遗物角发现的箱子差不多了。","The possession of this brig, or rather all that she contained, was a perfect mine of wealth.In fact, a ship is like a little world in miniature, and the stores of the colony would be increased by a large number of useful articles.It would be, on a large scale, equivalent to the chest found at Flotsam Point."
"“还有，”潘克洛夫说，“为什么不让双桅船重新浮起来呢？如果船只是漏水，我们可以把它修补一下，这艘船有三四百吨重，比我们的‘乘风破浪号’可强多了！我们可以乘着它到很远的地方去！想去哪里，就去哪里！哈丁队长，我一定要和艾尔顿检查一下这艘船。它值得我们费功夫！”","“And besides,” thought Pencroft, “why should it be impossible to refloat the brig?If she has only a leak, that may be stopped up; a vessel from three to four hundred tons, why she is a regular ship compared to our ‘Bonadventure’!And we could go a long distance in her!We could go anywhere we liked!Captain Harding, Ayrton and I must examine her!She would be well worth the trouble!”"
"事实上，要是双桅船仍然可以航行的话，移民者回到祖国的机会将大大增加。不过，大伙儿还得等潮水落得很低的时候，才能找到这个重要问题的答案，因为到那时才能把双桅船船身的每一部分检查一遍。","In fact, if the brig was still fit to navigate, the colonists’ chances of returning to their native land were singularly increased.But, to decide this important question, it was necessary to wait until the tide was quite low, so that every part of the brig’s hull might be examined."
"把财物安全地转移到岸上后，哈丁和同伴们决定花点时间解决一下早饭。大伙儿几乎都要饿昏了。幸亏食品室隔得不远，而且纳布又是一个手脚麻利的厨师。于是，他们就在“石窟”附近吃了早饭，吃饭的过程中——可以猜得到——他们谈的尽是移民队神奇获救的这次事件。","When their treasures had been safely conveyed on shore, Harding and his companions agreed to devote some minutes to breakfast.They were almost famished; fortunately, the larder was not far off, and Neb was noted for being an expeditious cook.They breakfasted, therefore, near the Chimneys, and during their repast, as may be supposed, nothing was talked of but the event which had so miraculously saved the colony."
"“实在太神奇了，”潘克洛夫不停地说，“我们必须得承认，那帮混蛋被炸得正是时候！‘花岗石宫’当时就快要被侵占了！”","“Miraculous is the word,” repeated Pencroft, “for it must be acknowledged that those rascals blew up just at the right moment!Granite House was beginning to be uncomfortable as a habitation!”"
"“你能想一下，潘克洛夫，”通讯记者问，“这是怎么发生的，或者，是什么引起爆炸的？”","“And can you guess, Pencroft,” asked the reporter, “how it happened, or what can have occasioned the explosion?”"
"“哦！史佩莱先生，这个再简单不过了，”潘克洛夫答道，“罪犯们的船可不像军舰那么有纪律！他们可不是水手。显然，火药库的门一直开着，在那帮罪犯不停地开火的时候，哪个粗心的或者笨拙的家伙就这样把船给炸了！”","“Oh!Mr. Spilett, nothing is more simple,” answered Pencroft.“A convict vessel is not disciplined like a man-of-war!Convicts are not sailors.Of course the powder-magazine was open, and as they were firing incessantly, some careless or clumsy fellow just blew up the vessel!”"
"“哈丁队长，”赫伯特说，“我感到吃惊的是，爆炸的作用只有这么大。爆炸声音并不大，而且，只炸坏了几块船板和肋材。船看起来像是被撞沉的，而不是被炸毁的。”","“Captain Harding,” said Herbert, “what astonishes me is that the explosion has not produced more effect.The report was not loud, and besides there are so few planks and timbers torn out.It seems as if the ship had rather foundered than blown up.”"
"“那让你觉得吃惊吗，孩子？”工程师问。","“Does that astonish you, my boy?” asked the engineer."
"“是的，队长。”","“Yes, captain.”"
"“它同样让我觉得吃惊，赫伯特，”哈丁回答，“不过，等我们看了双桅船的船体以后，自然就能对这个问题作出解释了。”","“And it astonishes me also, Herbert,” replied he, “but when we visit the hull of the brig, we shall no doubt find the explanation of the matter.”"
"“怎么，队长，”潘克洛夫说，“你不会以为‘飞快号’只是被撞沉的，就像一艘船撞到了礁石一样？”","“Why, captain,” said Pencroft, “you don’t suppose that the ‘Speedy’ simply foundered like a ship which has struck on a rock?”"
"“如果海峡里有礁石，”纳布说，“为什么不可能呢？”","“Why not,” observed Neb, “if there are rocks in the channel?”"
"“胡扯，纳布，”潘克洛夫反驳，“你没看见船沉的那一刻。我清清楚楚地看见，就在双桅船沉没之前的一刹那，一个巨大的海浪把它顶了起来，接着船就往左舷的一侧倒下去了。如果只是触礁，那它就会一声不响地沉入海底，正常的船就该这样。”","“Nonsense, Neb,” answered Pencroft, “you did not look at the right moment.An instant before she sank, the brig, as I saw perfectly well, rose on an enormous wave, and fell back on her larboard side.Now, if she had only struck, she would have sunk quietly and gone to the bottom like an honest vessel.”"
"“那是因为它不是一艘正常的船！”纳布回嘴。","“It was just because she was not an honest vessel!” returned Neb."
"“好了，我们很快就知道是怎么一回事了，潘克洛夫。”工程师说。","“Well, we shall soon see, Pencroft.” said the engineer."
"“很快就知道了，”水手跟着说道，“不过，我敢用脑袋担保，海峡中绝对没有礁石。嘿，队长，坦白一点讲，你的意思是说这件事情有些奇怪？”","“We shall soon see,” rejoined the sailor, “but I would wager my head there are no rocks in the channel.Look here, captain, to speak candidly, do you mean to say that there is anything marvelous in the occurrence?”"
"赛勒斯·哈丁没有回答。","Cyrus Harding did not answer."
"“不管怎么样，”吉迪恩·史佩莱发话了，“触礁也好，爆炸也好，潘克洛夫，有一点你得承认，那就是事情发生的正是时候！”","“At any rate,” said Gideon Spilett, “whether rock or explosion, you will agree, Pencroft, that it occurred just in the nick of time!”"
"“这倒是，”水手说，“可是问题不在这儿啊。我是问哈丁队长，他有没有觉得这件事情有些神奇的地方。”","“Yes! yes!” replied the sailor, “but that is not the question.I ask Captain Harding if he sees anything supernatural in all this.”"
"“我不知道，潘克洛夫，”工程师回答，“我只能这样回答你。”","“I cannot say, Pencroft,” said the engineer.“That is all the answer I can make.”"
"潘克洛夫对这个回答一点儿也不满意。他坚持是“爆炸”，而且不肯放弃这个想法。他打死也不会同意，像海滩一样，底下铺着一层细沙的海峡中——水浅的时候，他还经常从这涉水经过呢——会有什么未知的礁石！","A reply which did not satisfy Pencroft at all.He stuck to “an explosion,” and did not wish to give it up.He would never consent to admit that in that channel, with its fine sandy bed, just like the beach, which he had often crossed at low water, there could be an unknown rock."
"况且，双桅船沉没的时候，水位很高，就是说，即使潮水退下有礁石露出来，水量也足够把船举着“越”过任何石头。所以，那样的话，不可能有撞击。船并没有触礁。它就是爆炸了。","And besides, at the time the brig foundered, it was high water, that is to say, there was enough water to carry the vessel clear over any rocks which would not be uncovered at low tide.Therefore, there could not have been a collision.Therefore, the vessel had not struck.So she had blown up."
"必须承认，水手的分析不无道理。","And it must be confessed that the sailor’s arguments were reasonable."
"将近一点半的时候，移民们登上小船去看沉船了。可惜的是，双桅船的两只小船没能保留下来：有一只，前面已经说过，在慈悲河河口被撞得粉碎，完全报废了；另外一只在双桅船沉没的时候消失了，再没露出来，肯定是被撞碎了。","Towards half-past one, the colonists embarked in the boat to visit the wreck.It was to be regretted that the brig’s two boats had not been saved; but one, as has been said, had gone to pieces at the mouth of the Mercy, and was absolutely useless; the other had disappeared when the brig went down, and had not again been seen, having doubtless been crushed."
"“飞快号”的船身才开始慢慢露出水面。船往一边倾斜着，剧烈的震动把压舱的底货震了出来，压断了桅杆，整条船的龙骨都看得见。一种令人费解的、可怕的水下活动倾覆了船身，同时，海里还冒出了一个巨大的水柱。","The hull of the “Speedy” was just beginning to issue from the water.The brig was lying right over on her side, for her masts being broken, pressed down by the weight of the ballast displaced by the shock, the keel was visible along her whole length.She had been regularly turned over by the inexplicable but frightful submarine action, which had been at the same time manifested by an enormous water-spout."
"移民们划着小船围着双桅船船身观察。随着潮水的退下，虽说他们还没弄明白失事的原因，但至少也确定了其产生的后果。","The settlers rowed round the hull, and in proportion as the tide went down, they could ascertain, if not the cause which had occasioned the catastrophe, at least the effect produced."
"靠近船头的部分，在离船艄七八英尺的地方，双桅船两侧的龙骨遭到了严重的毁坏。两边各开着一条至少20英尺长的大口子，根本堵不上。船底的铜包板和木板不见了，无疑被炸成了碎末，除此之外，就连用来连接的肋材、铁螺丝和木钉也都不见了。一股无法言说的蛮力把副龙骨从整个船身到船尾剥离了下来，短纵梁上的龙骨本身也裂开了好几处，整个龙骨已经完全折断了。","Towards the bows, on both sides of the keel, seven or eight feet from the beginning of the stem, the sides of the brig were frightfully torn.Over a length of at least twenty feet there opened two large leaks, which would be impossible to stop up.Not only had the copper sheathing and the planks disappeared, reduced, no doubt, to powder, but also the ribs, the iron bolts, and treenalls which united them.From the entire length of the hull to the stern the false keel had been separated with an unaccountable violence, and the keel itself, torn from the carline in several places, was split in all its length."
"“我看，”潘克洛夫叫道，“这艘船恐怕很难再浮起来喽。”","“I’ve a notion!” exclaimed Pencroft, “that this vessel will be difficult to get afloat again.”"
"“压根就不可能。”艾尔顿说。","“It will be impossible,” said Ayrton."
"“无论如何，”吉迪恩·史佩莱对水手说，“如果真的发生了爆炸，那它实在是产生了奇怪的后果！它没有炸坏甲板和水线以上部分，却炸裂了船身的底部！这些大口子看起来并不像火药库炸的，反而更像是礁石撞的。”","“At any rate,” observed Gideon Spilett to the sailor, “the explosion, if there has been one, has produced singular effects!It has split the lower part of the hull, instead of blowing up the deck and topsides!These great rents appear rather to have been made by a rock than by the explosion of a powder-magazine.”"
"“海峡里没有礁石！”水手反驳，“我可以承认你说的任何事情，惟独除了礁石这件。”","“There is not a rock in the channel!” answered the sailor.“I will admit anything you like, except the rock.”"
"“我们想法子进到船里边吧，”工程师说，“到那时可能就知道它遭到破坏的原因了。”","“Let us try to penetrate into the interior of the brig,” said the engineer; “perhaps we shall then know what to think of the cause of her destruction.”"
"这是最好的办法了，而且，大伙儿都同意把船上装载的财物清点一下，好好安排一下它们存放的地方。","This was the best thing to be done, and it was agreed, besides, to take an inventory of all the treasures on board, and to arrange their preservation."
"现在很容易就能进到双桅船里面了。潮水在继续下退，甲板上可以走人了。压仓的底货是一些沉重的铁块，船身有好几个地方都被戳破了。海水从船身的窟窿流出来，发出哗哗的响声。","Access to the interior of the brig was now easy.The tide was still going down and the deck was practicable.The ballast, composed of heavy masses of iron, had broken through in several places.The noise of the sea could be heard as it rushed out at the holes in the hull."
"赛勒斯·哈丁和同伴们手里拿着短柄小斧，沿着破烂的甲板往前走着。各种各样的箱子拦住了他们的去路，因为箱子浸水的时间很短，里面的东西可能还完好无损。","Cyrus Harding and his companions, hatchets in hand, advanced along the shattered deck.Cases of all sorts encumbered it, and, as they had been but a very short time in the water, their contents were perhaps uninjured."
"接下来，移民们忙着把船上的货物安全地存放起来。潮水再度涨潮还要几个小时，移民们必须最大限度地利用这点时间。艾尔顿和潘克洛夫在船身的入口处找到了索具，用它把木桶和箱子吊了起来。大伙儿把货物装进小船，运到岸边，接着又回来运送各种物品，打算以后再进行整理。","They then busied themselves in placing all this cargo in safety.The water would not return for several hours, and these hours must be employed in the most profitable way.Ayrton and Pencroft had, at the entrance made in the hull, discovered tackle, which would serve to hoist up the barrels and chests.The boat received them and transported them to the shore.They took the articles as they came, intending to sort them afterwards."
"总的来说，移民们欣喜万分，因为他们很快发现，双桅船上装载着各种各样的货物，包括五花八门的物件、器皿、制成品和工具，堪比中太平洋小岛上进行大规模沿海贸易的商船。不管想要什么，他们大概都可以在里面找到一些，大伙儿都一致认为这些东西正是林肯岛上的移民队所需要的。","At any rate, the settlers saw at once, with extreme satisfaction, that the brig possessed a very varied cargo—an assortment of all sorts of articles, utensils, manufactured goods, and tools—such as the ships which make the great coasting-trade of Polynesia are usually laden with.It was probable that they would find a little of everything, and they agreed that it was exactly what was necessary for the colony of Lincoln Island."
"然而，赛勒斯·哈丁吃惊地默默观察到，不管失事的原因是什么，正如前面所交待的，双桅船的船身遭到了重创，就连船的内部装置，尤其是靠近船艄的部分，也都被毁坏了。隔板和支柱都遭到了破坏，就好像是什么威力巨大的炮弹在双桅船内部爆炸过。移民们把箱子移开，在甲板上走来走去变得轻松多了。这些箱子不是很难移动的沉重的大件，而是简单的小件，上面标明起装载物的字迹已经模糊不清。","However—and Cyrus Harding observed it in silent astonishment—not only, as has been said, had the hull of the brig enormously suffered from the shock, whatever it was, that had occasioned the catastrophe, but the interior arrangements had been destroyed, especially towards the bows.Partitions and stanchions were smashed, as if some tremendous shell had burst in the interior of the brig.The colonists could easily go fore and aft, after having removed the cases as they were extricated.They were not heavy bales, which would have been difficult to remove, but simple packages, of which the stowage, besides, was no longer recognizable."
"移民们这时到了船尾，这里原来是舵楼甲板。按照艾尔顿的指引，他们应该在这儿寻找火药库。赛勒斯·哈丁认为，火药库没有爆炸，或许会留下几桶火药，而且火药一向有金属外壳包着，可能不会受潮。","The colonists then reached the stern of the brig—the part formerly surmounted by the poop.It was there that, following Ayrton’s directions, they must look for the powder-magazine.Cyrus Harding thought that it had not exploded; that it was possible some barrels might be saved, and that the powder, which is usually enclosed in metal coverings might not have suffered from contact with the water."
"事情确实是这样。他们从子弹堆里找到20桶火药，桶里都衬着铜皮。亲眼看到这一切的潘克洛夫被说服了：“飞快号”的沉没绝不是因为爆炸。而且，放置火药库的那部分船身遭受的损失反而最小。","This, in fact, was just what had happened.They extricated from among a large number of shot twenty barrels, the insides of which were lined with copper.Pencroft was convinced by the evidence of his own eyes that the destruction of the “Speedy” could not be attributed to an explosion.That part of the hull in which the magazine was situated was, moreover, that which had suffered least."
"“或许不是炸沉的，”倔强的水手说，“可是至于说是触礁，海峡里可是一块石头也没有！”","“It may be so,” said the obstinate sailor; “but as to a rock, there is not one in the channel!”"
"“那么，船到底是怎么沉的呢？”赫伯特问道。","“Then, how did it happen?” asked Herbert."
"“我不知道，”潘克洛夫回答，“连哈丁队长都不知道，别人怎么会知道，而且，以后也不会有人弄明白了。”","“I don’t know,” answered Pencroft, “Captain Harding doesn’t know, and nobody knows or ever will know!”"
"这些调查花了移民们几个小时的时间，这时，潮水开始上涨了。目前，工作必须先放一放。大伙儿不担心双桅船被海水冲走，因为它像抛了锚似的，已经牢牢地固定在那儿了。","Several hours had passed during these researches, and the tide began to flow.Work must be suspended for the present.There was no fear of the brig being carried away by the sea, for she was already fixed as firmly as if moored by her anchors."
"因此，他们可以放心地等到第二天再接着工作，可是，双桅船本身已经不能“起死回生”，最好的办法是赶紧把船身剩余的部分抢救出来，因为船可能会很快地被海峡里的流沙吞没。　","They could, therefore, without inconvenience, wait until the next day to resume operations; but, as to the vessel itself, she was doomed, and it would be best to hasten to save the remains of her hull, as she would not be long in disappearing in the quicksands of the channel."
"现在是傍晚五点钟。移民们都辛苦劳作了一天。吃晚饭时，大家的胃口都很好，吃过饭，尽管很累，可大家还是忍不住要把“飞快号”上的装货箱子打开检查一下。","It was now five o’clock in the evening.It had been a hard day’s work for the men.They ate with good appetite, and notwithstanding their fatigue, they could not resist, after dinner, their desire of inspecting the cases which composed the cargo of the “Speedy.”"
"大部分箱子里装的都是衣服，可以想象，它们很受岛上的移民们欢迎。这些衣服够整个移民队穿了，有够所有人穿衣的亚麻布，和够所有人穿的鞋子。","Most of them contained clothes, which, as may be believed, was well received.There were enough to clothe a whole colony—linen for every one’s use, shoes for every one’s feet."
"“我们太富有了！”潘克洛夫喊，“可我们到底要怎么处理所有这些？”","“We are too rich!” exclaimed Pencroft, “But what are we going to do with all this?”"
"水手还看见了一桶桶的火药、佩枪、棉花包、耕作用具、木匠、细木匠和铁匠的工具，还有一盒子一盒子的各种各样的种子，由于在水里的时间很短，这些种子一点儿也没受潮。水手每看到一样东西，就高兴地欢呼一阵。啊，要是在两年前，这些东西该是多么珍贵！现在，即使勤劳的移民们已经有了工具，这些财富也依然有用得上的地方。","And every moment burst forth the hurrahs of the delighted sailor when he caught sight of the barrels of gunpowder, firearms and sidearms, balls of cotton, implements of husbandry, carpenter’s, joiner’s, and blacksmith’s tools, and boxes of all kinds of seeds, not in the least injured by their short sojourn in the water.Ah, two years before, how these things would have been prized!And now, even though the industrious colonists had provided themselves with tools, these treasures would find their use."
"花岗石宫的储藏室还有不少空间，可要赶在天黑之前把所有的东西存放好，是不可能的了。同时，移民们还得提醒自己，“飞快号”上的六个逃犯已经上了岛，他们极有可能是一群穷凶极恶的匪徒，大伙儿地好好提防着这几个人。尽管慈悲河上的桥已被扯了下来，罪犯们怎么可能被一条河流或小溪挡住去路，一旦被逼得走投无路，这帮人可是什么事情都干得出来。","There was no want of space in the store-rooms of Granite House, but that daytime would not allow them to stow away the whole.It would not do also to forget that the six survivors of the “Speedy’s” crew had landed on the island, for they were in all probability scoundrels of the deepest dye, and it was necessary that the colonists should be on their guard against them.Although the bridges over the Mercy were raised, the convicts would not be stopped by a river or a stream and, rendered desperate, these wretches would be capable of anything."
"移民们不久将会研究出最好要采取什么计划，同时，他们得保护好堆放在“石窟”附近的箱子和物件，于是，到了晚上，大家轮流站岗放哨。","They would see later what plan it would be best to follow; but in the meantime it was necessary to mount guard over cases and packages heaped up near the Chimneys, and thus the settlers employed themselves in turn during the night."
"然而，到了早上，罪犯们并没有发动任何袭击。贾普和托普在花岗石宫脚下守着，一有动静，会马上发出警报。接下来的三天——10月的19、20、21号——移民们都在忙着抢救每一样有价值的，或者但凡有点用途的物品，不管是货物也好，还是船上的索具也好，都被留了下来。退潮的时候，他们往岸上拖物品，涨潮时，他们则把抢救出来的东西存放好。船身的铜包板有很大一部分被剥离了下来，船身日渐下沉。可是，艾尔顿和潘克洛夫赶在重物从船底露出沉入泥沙之前，潜入海峡水底，捞上来了双桅船的锚链、压仓的铁块，甚至还有四门炮，这些都是利用空桶把它们浮起来，然后带到岸边的。","The morning came, however, without the convicts having attempted any attack.Master Jup and Top, on guard at the foot of Granite House, would have quickly given the alarm.The three following day—the 19th, 20th, and 21st of October—were employed in saving everything of value, or of any use whatever, either from the cargo or rigging of the brig.At low tide they overhauled the hold—at high tide they stowed away the rescued articles.A great part of the copper sheathing had been torn from the hull, which every day sank lower.But before the sand had swallowed the heavy things which had fallen through the bottom, Ayrton and Pencroft, diving to the bed of the channel, recovered the chains and anchors of the brig, the iron of her ballast, and even four guns, which, floated by means of empty casks, were brought to shore."
"可以看到移民队的军火库和花岗石宫的储藏室都因为沉船而获得了扩充。潘克洛夫总是热衷于种种“宏图构想”，这时，已经说到要造一个炮台来控制海峡和慈悲河口了。他打算用这四门炮，阻止任何舰队侵犯林肯岛的水域，不管他们有多强大！","It may be seen that the arsenal of the colony had gained by the wreck, as well as the storerooms of Granite House.Pencroft, always enthusiastic in his projects, already spoke of constructing a battery to command the channel and the mouth of the river.With four guns, he engaged to prevent any fleet, “however powerful it might be,” from venturing into the waters of Lincoln Island!"
"同时，当双桅船只剩下一个没用的船身时，天气变得很恶劣，船一下子就被彻底摧毁了。赛勒斯·哈丁本来还想把船身炸开，用来收拾一下岸上剩下的东西，可是，从东北方刮来的一股强风和大海上的狂潮让他不得不放弃这个想法，节省点火药。","In the meantime, when nothing remained of the brig but a useless hulk, bad weather came on, which soon finished her.Cyrus Harding had intended to blow her up, so as to collect the remains on the shore, but a strong gale from the northeast and a heavy sea compelled him to economize his powder."
"事实上，23号夜里，船身整个都粉碎了，一些残骸被卷到了岸边。","In fact, on the night of the 23rd, the hull entirely broke up, and some of the wreck was cast up on the beach."
"至于船上的文件，就更不必说了。尽管哈丁仔仔细细地搜找了尾楼的抽屉，可还是什么都没找到。海盗们显然把任何有关船长或“飞快号”的主人的材料都销毁了，而且，船尾也没有漆着港口的名称，因此没法判断出船的国籍。不过，通过观察双桅船的两只小船的形状，艾尔顿和潘克洛夫相信，双桅船是英国制造的。","As to the papers on board, it is useless to say that, although he carefully searched the lockers of the poop, Harding did not discover any trace of them.The pirates had evidently destroyed everything that concerned either the captain or the owners of the “Speedy,” and, as the name of her port was not painted on her counter, there was nothing which would tell them her nationality.However, by the shape of her boats Ayrton and Pencroft believed that the brig was of English build."
"事故发生一周后——与其说是事故，倒不如称之为一次幸运的、尽管令人费解的、使移民们得到保护的事件——即使在退潮的时候，也看不见双桅船了。船的残骸消失了，花岗石宫因为得到了船上几乎所有的物品，而变得富足起来。","A week after the castrophe—or, rather, after the fortunate, though inexplicable, event to which the colony owed its preservation—nothing more could be seen of the vessel, even at low tide.The wreck had disappeared, and Granite House was enriched by nearly all it had contained."
"然而，笼罩着这次奇怪的毁灭事件的神秘气氛本来可能一直都不会散去，直到11月30号，纳布在海滩上散步时，发现了一块铁筒的厚片，上面看得出爆炸过的痕迹。厚片的边缘打着卷儿，残缺不全，就像是遭到了什么爆炸性物体的破坏。","However, the mystery which enveloped its strange destruction would doubtless never have been cleared away if, on the 30th of November, Neb, strolling on the beach, had not found a piece of a thick iron cylinder, bearing traces of explosion.The edges of this cylinder were twisted and broken, as if they had been subjected to the action of some explosive substance."
"纳布把这个金属厚片带回来交给主人，哈丁当时正和同伴们呆在“石窟”的工厂里。","Neb brought this piece of metal to his master, who was then occupied with his companions in the workshop of the Chimneys."
"赛勒斯·哈丁专注地检查了厚片，然后，对潘克洛夫说，","Cyrus Harding examined the cylinder attentively, then, turning to Pencroft,—"
"“朋友，你一直坚持认为，”他说道，“‘飞快号’不是撞沉的，是吧？”","“You persist, my friend,” said he, “in maintaining that the ‘Speedy’ was not lost in consequence of a collision?”"
"“是的，队长，”水手回答，“你我都知道海峡里没有石头。”","“Yes, captain,” answered the sailor.“You know as well as I do that there are no rocks in the channel.”"
"“那能否认为，船是撞上了这块铁片呢？”工程师一边说，一边把残缺不全的铁筒给他看。","“But suppose she had run against this piece of iron?” said the engineer, showing the broken cylinder."
"“什么，这么点破铁！”潘克洛夫完全不相信地喊道。","“What, that bit of pipe!” exclaimed Pencroft in a tone of perfect incredulity."
"“朋友们，”哈丁接着说道，“你们记得船沉没前，有一个水柱把船抛起来了？”","“My friends,” resumed Harding, “you remember that before she foundered the brig rose on the summit of a regular waterspout?”"
"“是的，队长。”赫伯特回答。","“Yes, captain.” replied Herbert."
"“好，你们想知道是什么产生的水柱吗？就是这个。”工程师举着破铁筒子说。","“Well, would you like to know what occasioned that waterspout?It was this,” said the engineer, holding up the broken tube."
"“这个？”潘克洛夫回答道。","“That?” returned Pencroft."
"“是的！这个铁筒是水雷的残余！”","“Yes!This cylinder is all that remains of a torpedo!”"
"“水雷！”工程师的同伴们叫道。","“A torpedo!” exclaimed the engineer’s companions."
"“那是谁把水雷放在那儿的？”不愿让步的潘克洛夫又问。","“And who put the torpedo there?” demanded Pencroft, who did not like to yield."
"“我只能告诉你，那个人不是我，”赛勒斯·哈丁回答，“可是它确实被放在那儿，你可以判断出它那无比巨大的能量！”","“All that I can tell you is, that it was not I,” answered Cyrus Harding; “but it was there, and you have been able to judge of its incomparable power!”"
"第五章","Chapter 5"
"因此，这样一来，一切都可以归因于海底水雷的爆炸。赛勒斯·哈丁不可能弄错，因为在南北统一战争期间，他曾经试制过这种可怕的毁灭性武器。这个铁筒里装着炸药，比如甘油、苦味酸或其他相同性质的物品，就是因为铁筒爆炸了，海峡中的水流才掀成一个圆盖，双桅船的船底才炸裂，船于是立刻沉没了，船身受到的破坏非常严重，再也浮不起来了。一个水雷能像摧毁一艘渔船一样，轻而易举地摧毁一艘装甲舰，“飞快号”又岂在话下！","So, then, all was explained by the submarine explosion of this torpedo.Cyrus Harding could not be mistaken, as, during the war of the Union, he had had occasion to try these terrible engines of destruction.It was under the action of this cylinder, charged with some explosive substance, nitro-glycerine, picrate, or some other material of the same nature, that the water of the channel had been raised like a dome, the bottom of the brig crushed in, and she had sunk instantly, the damage done to her hull being so considerable that it was impossible to refloat her.The “Speedy” had not been able to withstand a torpedo that would have destroyed an ironclad as easily as a fishing-boat!"
"是的！一切都可以解释了，除了一个问题——海峡中怎么会有水雷？","Yes! all was explained, everything—except the presence of the torpedo in the waters of the channel!"
"“朋友们，那么，”赛勒斯·哈丁说，“我们可以不用再怀疑，岛上还有一个神秘的人物，或许他跟我们一样，遇难后被遗弃在荒岛上，我说这些，是希望艾尔顿也能了解在这两年所发生的种种奇怪的事情。我想象不出这位好心的陌生人到底是谁，有好多次都是他从中干预帮了我们，这让我们感到非常幸运。我也无法明白，他屡次帮助我们，却依然不露面的目的何在？不过，他倒是确确实实给了我们很大的帮助，而且，也只有一个具备天大的本事的人才能这样做。我们大家，包括艾尔顿，都要感谢他，因为我从气球上掉下来后，如果是这位陌生人把我从海里救出来的话，那么，显然也是他写了那个纸条，然后把瓶子放进海峡中，让我们知道了同伴的处境。另外，也是他引着那只箱子，把它放在了遗物角，让我们得到了所需的一切；是他在小岛的高地上点着了火把，使你们得以安全着陆；是他打了西貒一枪；也是他把水雷放在海峡中，炸毁了双桅船；一句话，所有那些我们解释不了的事情，都是这位神秘人所做的。因此，不管他是谁，是船遇难了也好，还是流放在小岛上也好，我们都要感激他，不然，就成了忘恩负义的人了。我们欠他的人情，希望有一天能够报答他。”","“My friends, then,” said Cyrus Harding, “we can no longer be in doubt as to the presence of a mysterious being, a castaway like us, perhaps, abandoned on our island, and I say this in order that Ayrton may be acquainted with all the strange events which have occurred during these two years.Who this beneficent stranger is, whose intervention has, so fortunately for us, been manifested on many occasions, I cannot imagine.What his object can be in acting thus, in concealing himself after rendering us so many services, I cannot understand: But his services are not the less real, and are of such a nature that only a man possessed of prodigious power, could render them.Ayrton is indebted to him as much as we are, for, if it was the stranger who saved me from the waves after the fall from the balloon, evidently it was he who wrote the document, who placed the bottle in the channel, and who has made known to us the situation of our companion.I will add that it was he who guided that chest, provided with everything we wanted, and stranded it on Flotsam Point; that it was he who lighted that fire on the heights of the island, which permitted you to land; that it was he who fired that bullet found in the body of the peccary; that it was he who plunged that torpedo into the channel, which destroyed the brig; in a word, that all those inexplicable events, for which we could not assign a reason, are due to this mysterious being.Therefore, whoever he may be, whether shipwrecked, or exiled on our island, we shall be ungrateful, if we think ourselves freed from gratitude towards him.We have contracted a debt, and I hope that we shall one day pay it.”"
"“亲爱的赛勒斯，你说得对，”吉迪恩·史佩莱说，　“是的，岛上的什么地方藏着一个几乎无所不能的人，这个人的力量对我们有很大的好处。我还要补充一点儿，如果我们承认实际生活中真的有超自然的事情发生，那这位陌生人似乎就真的具备一种近乎超自然的力量。是不是他从花岗石宫的井里听到了我们的谈话，因而知道了我们的全盘计划？是不是他在小船首次航行时，把瓶子扔给我们的？是不是他把托普从湖里扔出来，杀了儒艮？也是他——所有的事情都让我们相信——在其他人都无能为力的情况下，把你从海里救出来的吧？如果都是他，那他简直拥有一种无所不能的能力了。”","“You are right in speaking thus, my dear Cyrus,” replied Gideon Spilett.“Yes, there is an almost all-powerful being, hidden in some part of the island, and whose influence has been singularly useful to our colony.I will add that the unknown appears to possess means of action which border on the supernatural, if in the events of practical life the supernatural were recognizable.Is it he who is in secret communication with us by the well in Granite House, and has he thus a knowledge of all our plans?Was it he who threw us that bottle, when the vessel made her first cruise?Was it he who threw Top out of the lake, and killed the dugong?Was it he, who as everything leads us to believe, saved you from the waves, and that under circumstances in which any one else would not have been able to act?If it was he, he possesses a power which renders him master of the elements.”"
"通讯记者的分析合乎情理，大伙儿也都是这样想的。","The reporter’s reasoning was just, and every one felt it to be so."
"“是的，”赛勒斯·哈丁接着说道，“如果我们可以肯定是一个人在帮助我们，那我也认为这个人具备一种超凡的能力。现在还剩下一个谜，不过，等到我们找到这个人，谜底也就自然解开了。那么，现在的问题是，我们是应该尊重这位慷慨人士的隐居身份，还是应该竭尽全力把他找出来？你们对此是怎么看的？”","“Yes,” rejoined Cyrus Harding, “if the intervention of a human being is not more questionable for us, I agree that he has at his disposal means of action beyond those possessed by humanity.There is a mystery still, but if we discover the man, the mystery will be discovered also.The question, then, is, ought we to respect the incognito of this generous being, or ought we to do everything to find him out?What is your opinion on the matter?”"
"“我觉得，”潘克洛夫说，“不管是谁，他都是一个勇敢的人，我佩服他！”","“My opinion,” said Pencroft, “is that, whoever he may be, he is a brave man, and he has my esteem!”"
"“话虽不错，”哈丁说，“不过，潘克洛夫，你没回答我的问题。”","“Be it so,” answered Harding, “but that is not an answer, Pencroft.”"
"“哈丁先生，”纳布这时说，“我认为，我们可以尽量寻找你说的这位陌生人，不过，除非他自己乐意露面，不然，我们是找不到他的。”","“Master,” then said Neb, “my idea is, that we may search as long as we like for this gentleman whom you are talking about, but that we shall not discover him till he pleases.”"
"“说得不错，纳布。”潘克洛夫听了说。","“That’s not bad, what you say, Neb,” observed Pencroft."
"“我同意纳布的说法，”吉迪恩·史佩莱说，“但我们不能因此就不尝试寻找。不管能不能找到这个神秘的人，我们至少得尽到找他的一份心意。”","“I am of Neb’s opinion,” said Gideon Spilett, “but that is no reason for not attempting the adventure.Whether we find this mysterious being or not, we shall at least have fulfilled our duty towards him.”"
"“孩子，你呢，说说你的看法。”工程师转向赫伯特，问道。","“And you, my boy, give us your opinion,” said the engineer, turning to Herbert."
"“啊，”赫伯特满脸写着兴奋，嚷道，“他先是救了您，现在又救了我们大家，我真想谢谢他！”","“Oh,” cried Herbert, his countenance full of animation, “how I should like to thank him, he who saved you first, and who has now saved us!”"
"“当然，孩子，”潘克洛夫说，“我和大伙儿都想谢谢他。我不是个好奇的人，可是，要是能和这个陌生人见上一面，就算挖掉我一只眼睛我也愿意！我觉得，他一定长得帅极了，个子高高的，身体很壮实，留着好看的胡子，色彩光泽的头发，还有，他一定坐在云彩上，手里拿着一个大球！”","“Of course, my boy,” replied Pencroft, “so would I and all of us.I am not inquisitive, but I would give one of my eyes to see this individual face to face!It seems to me that he must be handsome, tall, strong, with a splendid beard, radiant hair, and that he must be seated on clouds, a great ball in his hands!”"
"“好了，潘克洛夫，”史佩莱说，“你描述的是造物主的形象吧。”","“But, Pencroft,” answered Spilett, “you are describing a picture of the Creator.”"
"“或许吧，史佩莱先生，”水手回答，“可他在我想象中就是这幅模样！”","“Possibly, Mr. Spilett,” replied the sailor, “but that is how I imagine him!”"
"“你呢，艾尔顿？”工程师问。","“And you, Ayrton?” asked the engineer."
"“哈丁队长，”艾尔顿回答，“在这个问题上，我没有更好的意见。不管你做什么，都肯定是最好不过的。要是想要我加入你们一块儿寻找的话，我随时乐意跟随。”","“Captain Harding,” replied Ayrton, “I can give you no better advice in this matter.Whatever you do will be best; when you wish me to join you in your researches, I am ready to follow you."
"“谢谢你，艾尔顿，”赛勒斯·哈丁说，“可是，我想从你那听到一个更为直接的回答。你是我们的伙伴；为了我们，你已经冒过好几次生命危险了。因此，我们做任何一个重要的决定时，都应该听一听每个人——自然也包括你——的意见。所以，说说吧。”","“I thank you, Ayrton,” answered Cyrus Harding, “but I should like a more direct answer to the question I put to you.You are our companion; you have already endangered your life several times for us, and you, as well as the rest, ought to be consulted in the matter of any important decision. Speak, therefore.”"
"“哈丁队长，”艾尔顿说，“我认为我们应该竭尽所能，找到这位陌生的恩人。也许他一个人孤零零的。也许他在受苦。也许他需要开启一种新的生活。我，就像你所说的，也应该还他一份人情。是他——只能是他——到达抱岛去过，在那里发现了你们知道的苦命人，然后想法子让你们知道那儿有一个不幸的人等着拯救。因此，多亏了他，我才重新变回了一个人。是的，我永远也不会忘记他！”","“Captain Harding,” replied Ayrton, “I think that we ought to do everything to discover this unknown benefactor.Perhaps he is alone.Perhaps he is suffering.Perhaps he has a life to be renewed.I, too, as you said, have a debt of gratitude to pay him.It was he, it could be only he who must have come to Tabor Island, who found there the wretch you knew, and who made known to you that there was an unfortunate man there to be saved.Therefore it is, thanks to him, that I have become a man again.No, I will never forget him!”"
"“那么，就这么决定了，”赛勒斯·哈丁说，“我们会尽快开始寻找，不放过岛上的任何一个角落。就连岛上最隐秘的地方，我们也要去搜一搜，希望这位陌生的朋友知道我们的目的后，能原谅我们！”","“That is settled, then,” said Cyrus Harding.“We will begin our researches as soon as possible.We will not leave a corner of the island unexplored.We will search into its most secret recesses, and will hope that our unknown friend will pardon us in consideration of our intentions!”"
"几天以来，移民们都在积极地忙着翻晒干草和收获。在实行他们的计划——探索荒岛上的未知领域——之前，他们希望把所有能做的工作都做完。而且，现在，从达抱岛上带回来的各种蔬菜也到了该收获的时候。移民们把所有东西都储藏了起来，幸亏花岗石宫足够大，简直可以把岛上的所有财富存放在里面。他们把收获下来的东西整整齐齐地存放在那儿，可以相信，地方很安全，坏人和野兽都发现不了。","For several days the colonists were actively employed in haymaking and the harvest.Before putting their project of exploring the yet unknown parts of the island into execution, they wished to get all possible work finished.It was also the time for collecting the various vegetables from the Tabor Island plants.All was stowed away, and happily there was no want of room in Granite House, in which they might have housed all the treasures of the island.The products of the colony were there, methodically arranged, and in a safe place, as may be believed, sheltered as much from animals as from man."
"有厚实的花岗石壁作保护，完全不必担心受潮。移民们用鹤嘴锄和火药把上甬道的许多天然石洞扩大了，花岗石宫因此成了一个大仓库，里面存着所有的粮食、武器、工具和闲置的器皿——总之，移民队的所有储备都在里面了。","There was no fear of damp in the middle of that thick mass of granite.Many natural excavations situated in the upper passage were enlarged either by pick-axe or mine, and Granite House thus became a general warehouse, containing all the provisions, arms, tools, and spare utensils—in a word, all the stores of the colony."
"从双桅船上得来的大炮都是上好的军械，在潘克洛夫的请求下，移民们用索具和辘轳把它们吊进了花岗石宫，还在窗户间开了炮眼，很快，就可以在花岗石壁上看见亮光光的炮口了。在这个高度上，他们可以俯瞰整个联合湾。这儿就好比一个小直布罗陀，任何在小岛抛锚的船只都不可避免地暴露在这个空中炮台的射程以内。","As to the guns obtained from the brig, they were pretty pieces of ordnance, which, at Pencroft’s entreaty, were hoisted by means of tackle and pulleys, right up into Granite House; embrasures were made between the windows, and the shining muzzles of the guns could soon be seen through the granite cliff.From this height they commanded all Union Bay.It was like a little Gibraltar, and any vessel anchored off the islet would inevitably be exposed to the fire of this aerial battery."
"“队长，”潘克洛夫一天说，这一天是11月8号，“既然我们的防御工事已经做好了，不如试试大炮的射程呀。”","“Captain,” said Pencroft one day, it was the 8th of November, “now that our fortifications are finished, it would be a good thing if we tried the range of our guns.”"
"“你觉得有用吗？”工程师问。","“Do you think that is useful?” asked the engineer."
"“不但有用，而且有必要！不然，怎么会知道提供给我们的那些超级棒的炮弹能打多远？”","“It is more than useful, it is necessary!Without that how are we to know to what distance we can send one of those pretty shot with which we are provided?”"
"“试试吧，潘克洛夫，”工程师说，“不过，我想，试的时候，我们应该留着普通火药，用火棉代替，反正那东西我们有的是。”","“Try them, Pencroft,” replied the engineer.“However, I think that in making the experiment, we ought to employ, not the ordinary powder, the supply of which, I think, should remain untouched, but the pyroxyle which will never fail us.”"
"“这些大炮受得了火棉的爆炸吗？”通讯记者问，他和潘克洛夫一样，迫切地想要试验一下花岗石宫的大炮。","“Can the cannon support the shock of the pyroxyle?” asked the reporter, who was not less anxious than Pencroft to try the artillery of Granite House."
"“我相信可以。不过，”工程师又说，“我们还是要小心点。”和工程师想的一样，这些大炮全都制作精良，都是用锻钢造的一种后膛炮，因此应该能装大量的火药，射程也应该很远。其实，考虑到实际效果，炮弹的射程应该尽可能的延长，而只有以极快的初速度打出炮弹时，才可能获得这种力量。","“I believe so.However,” added the engineer, “we will be prudent.”The engineer was right in thinking that the guns were of excellent make.Made of forged steel, and breech-loaders, they ought consequently to be able to bear a considerable charge, and also have an enormous range.In fact, as regards practical effect, the transit described by the ball ought to be as extended as possible, and this tension could only be obtained under the condition that the projectile should be impelled with a very great initial velocity."
"“初速度跟使用的火药量是成正比的，”哈丁对同伴们说，“在制造这些大炮的时候，是否使用了抵抗系数最高的金属材料关乎着一切，而钢铁毫无疑问就是所有金属中抵抗系数最高的。因此，我有理由相信，我们的大炮能安全地经受住爆炸气体的膨胀，从而给出精彩的实验结果。”","“Now,” said Harding to his companions, “the initial velocity is in proportion to the quantity of powder used.In the fabrication of these pieces, everything depends on employing a metal with the highest possible power of resistance, and steel is incontestably that metal of all others which resists the best.I have, therefore, reason to believe that our guns will bear without risk the expansion of the pyroxyle gas, and will give excellent results.”"
"“等我们试过以后，就可以更确定了！”潘克洛夫说。","“We shall be a great deal more certain of that when we have tried them!” answered Pencroft."
"四门大炮都保存得很好，这个自不必说。自打从水里捞出来后，水手就一直非常细心地看管它们。他给大炮擦拭，上油，磨光，清洗零件，在上面不知花了多长时间！现在这些大炮闪亮如新，就像美利坚海军保卫舰上的一样。","It is unnecessary to say that the four cannons were in perfect order.Since they had been taken from the water, the sailor had bestowed great care upon them.How many hours he had spent, in rubbing, greasing, and polishing them, and in cleaning the mechanism!And now the pieces were as brilliant as if they had been on board a frigate of the United States Navy."
"于是，在这一天，移民队的全体成员，贾普和托普也包括在内，共同见证了四门大炮相继被试验。他们用火棉代替普通火药，考虑到火棉的爆炸威力——前面交代过——是普通火药的四倍，他们把炮弹做成了圆锥筒形。","On this day, therefore, in presence of all the members of the colony, including Master Jup and Top, the four cannon were successively tried.They were charged with pyroxyle, taking into consideration its explosive power, which, as has been said, is four times that of ordinary powder: the projectile to be fired was cylindroconic."
"潘克洛夫站在那里，拿着火绳的末端，随时准备发射。","Pencroft, holding the end of the quick-match, stood ready to fire."
"哈丁一声令下，他开炮了。炮弹飞过小岛，落到了大海里，没法精确计算出距离。","At Harding’s signal, he fired.The shot, passing over the islet, fell into the sea at a distance which could not be calculated with exactitude."
"第二门大炮瞄准了遗物角尽头的岩石，炮弹打在了离花岗石宫将近有三英里的一块尖尖的石头上，打得碎片乱飞。这一炮是赫伯特瞄准并发射的，他很是为自己的第一炮感到自豪。潘克洛夫比他还自豪呢！这一炮打得这么漂亮，这份荣耀可是属于他亲爱的赫伯特啊。","The second gun was pointed at the rocks at the end of Flotsam Point, and the shot striking a sharp rock nearly three miles from Granite House, made it fly into splinters.It was Herbert who had pointed this gun and fired it, and very proud he was of his first shot.Pencroft only was prouder than he!Such a shot, the honor of which belonged to his dear boy."
"第三炮把目标定在联合湾北边的沙丘，炮弹打在四英里以外的沙石上，然后又弹了起来，落在大海里，溅起一片水花。","The third shot, aimed this time at the downs forming the upper side of Union Bay, struck the sand at a distance of four miles, then having ricocheted: was lost in the sea in a cloud of spray."
"打第四炮时，赛勒斯·哈丁想要试一下最多能射多远，就稍微多装了一点炮弹。因为怕爆炸，所有人都退到了一边，用一根长绳拉着点火。","For the fourth piece Cyrus Harding slightly increased the charge, so as to try its extreme range.Then, all standing aside for fear of its bursting, the match was lighted by means of a long cord."
"接着听到了一声震耳欲聋的爆炸声，不过，大炮完好无损。移民们冲到窗户边，看见炮弹擦过离花岗石宫几乎有五英里的颚骨角的岩石，消失在鲨鱼湾里了。","A tremendous report was heard, but the piece had held good, and the colonists rushing to the windows, saw the shot graze the rocks of Mandible Cape, nearly five miles from Granite House, and disappear in Shark Gulf."
"“太棒了，队长，”潘克洛夫欢呼道，声音大得简直可以跟爆炸声相媲美，“你觉得我们的炮台怎么样？太平洋上的海盗还胆敢出现在花岗石宫前面！现在，没有我们的允许，谁都不能在那儿登陆！”","“Well, captain,” exclaimed Pencroft, whose cheers might have rivaled the reports themselves, “what do you say of our battery?All the pirates in the Pacific have only to present themselves before Granite House!Not one can land there now without our permission!”"
"“相信我，潘克洛夫，”工程师说，“这样的实验还是不做的好。”","“Believe me, Pencroft,” replied the engineer, “it would be better not to have to make the experiment.”"
"“为什么，”水手说，“那应该怎么对付现在在岛上游荡的那六个坏蛋？难道就由着他们糟蹋我们的森林、田地和农场？这些海盗就是十足的美洲豹，我认为我们应该毫不犹豫地用大炮对付他们！你觉得呢，艾尔顿？”潘克洛夫转向他的同伴，说道。","“Well,” said the sailor, “what ought to be done with regard to those six villains who are roaming about the island?Are we to leave them to overrun our forests, our fields, our plantations?These pirates are regular jaguars, and it seems to me we ought not to hesitate to treat them as such!What do you think, Ayrton?” added Pencroft, turning to his companion."
"艾尔顿起先犹豫了一下，没有回答，赛勒斯·哈丁对潘克洛夫不假思索地提出这么一个问题感到非常抱歉。不过让他非常感动的是，艾尔顿最后谦卑地回答道：","Ayrton hesitated at first to reply, and Cyrus Harding regretted that Pencroft had so thoughtlessly put this question.And he was much moved when Ayrton replied in a humble tone,—"
"“我以前也是只美洲豹，潘克洛夫先生。我没权利发言。”","“I have been one of those jaguars, Mr. Pencroft. I have no right to speak.”"
"然后他慢慢地走开了。","And with a slow step he walked away."
"潘克洛夫恍然大悟。","Pencroft understood."
"“我真是个畜生！”他叫起来，“可怜的艾尔顿！他在这儿，和我们一样有发言权！”","“What a brute I am!” he exclaimed.“Poor Ayrton! He has as much right to speak here as any one!”"
"“没错，”吉迪恩·史佩莱说，“但他愈是沉默，我们愈发尊重他，我们应该尊重他追忆伤心往事的感受。”","“Yes,” said Gideon Spilett, “but his reserve does him honor, and it is right to respect the feeling which he has about his sad past.”"
"“当然，史佩莱先生，”水手回答，“你不必担心，我以后不会这样做了。我宁肯咬断自己的舌头，也不想带给艾尔顿一丁点伤害！可是话说回来。在我看来，这些流氓不配我们可怜，应该尽早把他们从岛上清除掉。”","“Certainly, Mr. Spilett,” answered the sailor, “and there is no fear of my doing so again.I would rather bite my tongue off than cause Ayrton any pain!But to return to the question.It seems to me that these ruffians have no right to any pity, and that we ought to rid the island of them as soon as possible.”"
"“这是你的主意，潘克洛夫？”工程师问。","“Is that your opinion, Pencroft?” asked the engineer."
"“我就是这么想的。”","“Quite my opinion.”"
"“在他们对我们再采取什么不利的行动之前，你就想毫不留情地去搜捕他们吗？”","“And before hunting them mercilessly, you would not wait until they had committed some fresh act of hostility against us?”"
"“难道他们做的还不够？”潘克洛夫发问，他不明白哈丁的这些顾虑。","“Isn’t what they have done already enough?” asked Pencroft, who did not understand these scruples."
"“他们或许会转变性情！”哈丁说，“忏悔也说不定呀。”","“They may adopt other sentiments!” said Harding, “and perhaps repent.”"
"“他们能忏悔！”水手叫道，耸了耸肩。","“They repent!” exclaimed the sailor, shrugging his shoulders."
"“潘克洛夫，想想艾尔顿吧！”赫伯特拉住水手的手说，“他不是改邪归正了嘛！”","“Pencroft, think of Ayrton!” said Herbert, taking the sailor’s hand.“He became an honest man again!”"
"潘克洛夫一一望了望自己的同伴。他从没想到，自己的提议会遭到反对。这帮混蛋是跟鲍勃·哈维的帮凶一块儿上岸的，那些人可是杀害“飞快号”全体船员的凶手啊，和他们和平共处，性情耿直的潘克洛夫可接受不了，在他看来，这群人就好比洪水猛兽，必须毫不迟疑毫不留情地把他们消灭掉。","Pencroft looked at his companions one after the other.He had never thought of his proposal being met with any objection.His rough nature could not allow that they ought to come to terms with the rascals who had landed on the island with Bob Harvey’s accomplices, the murderers of the crew of the “Speedy,” and he looked upon them as wild beasts which ought to be destroyed without delay and without remorse."
"“算了！”他说，“谁都跟我作对！你们竟然对那帮混蛋发起善心来了！好吧，但愿我们以后不要后悔！”","“Come!” said be.“Everybody is against me!You wish to be generous to those villains!Very well; I hope we mayn’t repent it!”"
"“如果我们一直小心防卫，”赫伯特说，“会有什么危险呢？”","“What danger shall we run,” said Herbert, “if we take care to be always on our guard?”"
"“嗯。”通讯记者说，他还没说过自己的看法，“他们有六个人，而且都装备精良。如果他们各自潜伏在一个角落，朝我们每人放一枪，就会立马成为小岛的主人！”","“Hum!” observed the reporter, who had not given any decided opinion.“They are six and well armed.If they each lay hid in a corner, and each fired at one of us, they would soon be masters of the colony!”"
"“那为什么他们没这么做呢？”赫伯特问，“显然是因为他们没兴趣这么做。况且，我们也是六个人。”","“Why have they not done so?” said Herbert.“No doubt because it was not their interest to do it.Besides, we are six also.”"
"“好吧，好吧！”潘克洛夫说，什么也说服不了他，“我们就让这些好人做他们想做的事吧，不必再为他们操心了！”","“Well, well!” replied Pencroft, whom no reasoning could have convinced.“Let us leave these good people to do what they like, and don’t think anything more about them!”"
"“好了，潘克洛夫，”纳布说，“不要把自己装成那么坏的一个人！假使那些不幸的人中的一个现在就在你的面前，完全在你的大炮的射程以内，你也不会开炮的。”","“Come, Pencroft,” said Neb, “don’t make yourself out so bad as all that!Suppose one of these unfortunate men were here before you, within good range of your guns, you would not fire.”"
"“我会像打一条疯狗一样，一炮把他打死，纳布。”潘克洛夫冷冷地说。","“I would fire on him as I would on a mad dog, Neb,” replied Pencroft coldly."
"“潘克洛夫，”工程师说，“你一直都很听从我的意见，那在这个问题上，你能听我的话吗？”","“Pencroft,” said the engineer, “you have always shown much deference to my advice; will you, in this matter, yield to me?”"
"“我可以照您的意思去做，哈丁队长。”水手嘴里这样回答着，心里并不服气。","“I will do as you please, Captain Harding,” answered the sailor, who was not at all convinced."
"“很好，我们再等等，除非他们先攻击我们，否则我们决不攻击他们。”","“Very well, wait, and we will not attack them unless we are attacked first.”"
"于是，虽然潘克洛夫认为这样做没什么好处，大伙儿对海盗的态度最终还是达成了一致。他们不会主动进攻，而是要采取防守的做法。毕竟，荒岛面积很大，还很肥沃。如果这些坏人的心底还存有一丝丝良知的话，他们或许还有改邪归正的希望。他们不想在这种环境里开始新生吗？不管怎么样，就是单纯出于人道主义，也应该等一等。移民们不会再像以前一样，来去无所顾忌了。以前，他们只需提防凶猛的野兽，可是现在，六个或许再恶劣不过的罪犯正游荡在他们的岛上。这自然是个严肃的问题，而且，如果移民们的胆子小一点，这就等于失去了安全的保障！不管怎样！眼下，移民们有理由反对潘克洛夫的意见。可是将来他们会是对的吗？这一点还需拭目以待。","Thus their behavior towards the pirates was agreed upon, although Pencroft augured nothing good from it.They were not to attack them, but were to be on their guard.After all, the island was large and fertile.If any sentiment of honesty yet remained in the bottom of their hearts, these wretches might perhaps be reclaimed.Was it not their interest in the situation in which they found themselves to begin a new life?At any rate, for humanity’s sake alone, it would be right to wait.The colonists would no longer as before, be able to go and come without fear.Hitherto they had only wild beasts to guard against, and now six convicts of the worst description, perhaps, were roaming over their island.It was serious, certainly, and to less brave men, it would have been security lost!No matter!At present, the colonists had reason on their side against Pencroft.Would they be right in the future?That remained to be seen."
"第六章","Chapter 6"
"不过，移民们眼下的头等大事，就是照先前决定的那样，对全岛做一次探险。这样做主要有两个目的：其一，寻找那个神秘的陌生人，因为现在大家都确信他就在岛上；其二，了解一下海盗们的情况，看看他们藏在哪里，过着怎样的日子，还有，这帮家伙有什么值得害怕的地方。赛勒斯·哈丁希望能立即出发；可是因为这次探险可能会持续好几天，所以最好还是把各种必需品和工具装在车上，以便安排宿营。一只野驴又伤了腿，暂时不能拉车，还得过几天才能痊愈。于是，出发的日期推迟了一个礼拜，定在11月20号。这个纬度的11月相当于北半球的五月，因此，正是好天气。太阳进入了南回归线，是一年中白昼最长的时候。因此，这个时候对计划的这次探险很有利，即使两个主要的目的实现不了，移民们也会从中获得很多发现，尤其是自然物产方面的发现，因为哈丁提议去探索一下远西的一直延伸到盘蛇半岛尽头的密林。","However, the chief business of the colonists was to make that complete exploration of the island which had been decided upon, and which would have two objects: to discover the mysterious being whose existence was now indisputable, and at the same time to find out what had become of the pirates, what retreat they had chosen, what sort of life they were leading, and what was to be feared from them.Cyrus Harding wished to set out without delay; but as the expedition would be of some days duration, it appeared best to load the cart with different materials and tools in order to facilitate the organization of the encampments.One of the onagers, however, having hurt its leg, could not be harnessed at present, and a few days’ rest was necessary.The departure was, therefore, put off for a week, until the 20th of November.The month of November in this latitude corresponds to the month of May in the northern zones.It was, therefore, the fine season.The sun was entering the tropic of Capricorn, and gave the longest days in the year.The time was, therefore, very favorable for the projected expedition, which, if it did not accomplish its principal object, would at any rate be fruitful in discoveries, especially of natural productions, since Harding proposed to explore those dense forests of the Far West, which stretched to the extremity of the Serpentine Peninsula."
"距离出发的日子还有9天，大伙儿都同意利用这段时间，把眺望岗上的工作做完。","During the nine days which preceded their departure, it was agreed that the work on Prospect Heights should be finished off."
"而且，艾尔顿也需要回畜栏去照料一下饲养的牲畜。大伙儿决定让他在那儿呆两天，等把马厩的饲料准备充足后，再回花岗石宫。","Moreover, it was necessary for Ayrton to return to the corral, where the domesticated animals required his care.It was decided that he should spend two days there, and return to Granite House after having liberally supplied the stables."
"艾尔顿出发前，哈丁考虑到岛上没有以前安全了，问他是否想再找一个人和他一块儿去。艾尔顿说不需要，因为他一个人能应付得了那里的活儿，况且，他什么危险也不怕。要是畜栏或周边发生什么事情，他会立即给花岗石宫发电报，提醒移民们。","As he was about to start, Harding asked him if he would not like one of them to accompany him, observing that the island was less safe than formerly.Ayrton replied that this was unnecessary, as he was enough for the work, and that besides he apprehended no danger.If anything occurred at the corral, or in the neighborhood, he could instantly warn the colonists by sending a telegram to Granite House."
"9号清晨，艾尔通驾着一只野驴，拉着马车，天一亮就动身了。过了两个钟头，他打电报回来说畜栏里平安无事。","Ayrton departed at dawn on the 9th, taking the cart drawn by one onager, and two hours after, the electric wire announced that he had found all in order at the corral."
"在这两天中，哈丁忙着实行一个计划，好让花岗石宫免于受到任何突然袭击。格兰特湖南端原有的出口早已被堵上了，被长出的草木盖住了一部分，现在必须把它全部挡起来。这个再容易不过了，因为只要让湖水涨上两三英尺，就可以把出口完全淹没。现在，为了抬升水位，他们只得在湖的两个缺口处各建一个水坝，因为湖水就是通过这两个缺口流入甘油河与瀑布河的。","During these two days Harding busied himself in executing a project which would completely guard Granite House against any surprise.It was necessary to completely conceal the opening of the old outlet, which was already walled up and partly hidden under grass and plants, at the southern angle of Lake Grant.Nothing was easier, since if the level of the lake was raised two or three feet, the opening would be quite beneath it.Now, to raise this level they had only to establish a dam at the two openings made by the lake, and by which were fed Creek Glycerine and Falls River."
"两个水坝宽不过八英尺，高不过三英尺，移民们干劲十足，很快就用结实的石块垒起来了。","The colonists worked with a will, and the two dams which besides did not exceed eight feet in width by three in height, were rapidly erected by means of well-cemented blocks of stone."
"水坝造好后，外人绝对猜不到湖的下面还藏着一个地下通道，湖水以前就是从那儿流出去的。","This work finished, it would have been impossible to guess that at that part of the lake, there existed a subterranean passage through which the overflow of the lake formerly escaped."
"当然，供应花岗石宫蓄水池用水以及为升降梯提供能量的小溪还小心地保留着，保证不断水。只要把升降梯升上去，这个安全又舒适的藏身所就能免遭任何突袭了。","Of course the little stream which fed the reservoir of Granite House and worked the lift, had been carefully preserved, and the water could not fail.The lift once raised, this sure and comfortable retreat would be safe from any surprise."
"这项工作这么快就做完了，还剩点时间，潘克洛夫、吉迪恩·史佩莱和赫伯特想要去一次气球港。水手急着看一下，罪犯们是不是已经到过“乘风破浪号”停泊的小海湾了。","This work had been so quickly done, that Pencroft, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert found time to make an expedition to Port Balloon, The sailor was very anxious to know if the little creek in which the “Bonadventure” was moored, had been visited by the convicts."
"“这些先生是在南岸登陆的，”他说，“如果他们沿着海滨走，有可能会发现小海湾，那样的话，我们的‘乘风破浪号’就惨了。”","“These gentlemen,” he observed, “landed on the south coast, and if they followed the shore, it is to be feared that they may have discovered the little harbor, and in that case, I wouldn’t give half-a-dollar for our ‘Bonadventure.’”"
"潘克洛夫的担忧并非毫无根据，看起来，大伙儿都特别想去一趟气球港。11月10号，吃过晚饭，水手和同伴们要动身了，每个人都装备得很完善。潘克洛夫大摇大摆地把两颗子弹分别装进他的步枪的两个枪管里，还摇晃着头，好像是在说，无论谁——管他是人还是猛兽——要是离他太近，不会有任何好处的。吉迪恩·史佩莱和赫伯特也带上枪，大概三点的时候，三个人离开了花岗石宫。","Pencroft’s apprehensions were not without foundation, and a visit to Port Balloon appeared to be very desirable.The sailor and his companions set off on the 10th of November, after dinner, well armed.Pencroft, ostentatiously slipping two bullets into each barrel of his rifle, shook his head in a way which betokened nothing good to any one who approached too near him, whether “man or beast,” as he said.Gideon Spilett and Herbert also took their guns, and about three o’clock all three left Granite House."
"纳布跟着他们走到慈悲河拐弯的地方，等到他们过了河，就把桥扯了起来。大伙儿商量好，回来的时候，就放一声枪，一听到这个信号，纳布就会过来，把连接河两岸的桥放下。","Neb accompanied them to the turn of the Mercy, and after they had crossed, he raised the bridge.It was agreed that a gunshot should announce the colonists’ return, and that at the signal Neb should return and reestablish the communication between the two banks of the river."
"这一小队直接沿着通往小岛南岸的小路前进。虽然不过是三英里半的路程，吉迪恩·史佩莱和同伴们却走了俩小时。他们沿途细细地查看了小路附近、密林以及达抱沼地。可是，连逃犯的影子也没看到，显然，这帮家伙并没有发现移民的人数和移民们掌握的防御措施，因此现在藏在岛上一些不容易被发现的地方。","The little band advanced directly along the road which led to the southern coast of the island.This was only a distance of three miles and a half, but Gideon Spilett and his companions took two hours to traverse it.They examined all the border of the road, the thick forest, as well as Tabor Marsh.They found no trace of the fugitives who, no doubt, not having yet discovered the number of the colonists, or the means of defense which they had at their disposal, had gained the less accessible parts of the island."
"到了气球港，看见“乘风破浪号”安然无事地浮在狭窄的海湾上，潘克洛夫非常满意。气球港周围有高高的岩石作掩护，隐蔽得很好，因此，不管是从陆地上，还是大海里，都很难发现它。","Arrived at Port Balloon, Pencroft saw with extreme satisfaction that the “Bonadventure” was tranquilly floating in the narrow creek.However, Port Balloon was so well hidden among high rocks, that it could scarcely be discovered either from the land or the sea."
"“快过来，”潘克洛夫叫，“那帮混蛋还没来过这儿。俗话说，‘深山有虎豹’，罪犯们一定藏到远西森林里去了。”","“Come,” said Pencroft, “the blackguards have not been there yet.Long grass suits reptiles best, and evidently we shall find them in the Far West.”"
"“这真是万幸啊，不然，要是他们发现了‘乘风破浪号’，一定会乘着它离开，那样我们就再也回不了达抱岛了。”赫伯特说道。","“And it’s very lucky, for if they had found the ‘Bonadventure’,” added Herbert, “they would have gone off in her, and we should have been prevented from returning to Tabor Island.”"
"“确实是这样，”通讯记者说，“我们应该在那座岛上留一张纸条，上面写上林肯岛的位置以及艾尔顿现在的住址，以防那艘苏格兰游船回来接他。”","“Indeed,” remarked the reporter, “it will be important to take a document there which will make known the situation of Lincoln Island, and Ayrton’s new residence, in case the Scotch yacht returns to fetch him.”"
"“好了，‘乘风破浪号’随时在这儿待命，史佩莱先生。”水手说，“它和它的船员一接到通知立马就能出发！”","“Well, the ‘Bonadventure’ is always there, Mr. Spilett,” answered the sailor.“She and her crew are ready to start at a moment’s notice!”"
"“潘克洛夫，我觉得等我们的全岛探险结束以后，再去干这件事情吧。如果我们找到了那个陌生人，不管是林肯岛，还是达抱岛，他很有可能都了如指掌。不要忘记肯定是他写了那张纸条，或许他还知道游船什么时候回来！”","“I think, Pencroft, that that is a thing to be done after our exploration of the island is finished.It is possible after all that the stranger, if we manage to find him, may know as much about Tabor Island as about Lincoln Island.Do not forget that he is certainly the author of the document, and he may, perhaps, know how far we may count on the return of the yacht!”"
"“可是，”潘克洛夫叫道，“他究竟是谁啊？这个朋友知道我们，我们却对他一无所知！如果他只是个遇难后被抛弃在岛上的人，那他为什么要把自己藏起来呀？我们是老实人，我想，谁都不会讨厌老实人吧。他是不是自愿来到岛上的？要是哪天想离开的话，他就能离开吗？他是不是还在岛上？他还要继续呆下去吗？”","“But!” exclaimed Pencroft, “who in the world can he be?The fellow knows us and we know nothing about him!If he is a simple castaway, why should he conceal himself!We are honest men, I suppose, and the society of honest men isn’t unpleasant to any one.Did he come here voluntarily?Can he leave the island if he likes?Is he here still?Will he remain any longer?”"
"潘克洛夫、吉迪恩·史佩莱和赫伯特一面交谈着，一面走上“乘风破浪号”,检查一下船的甲板。水手仔细看了一下系锚缆的系缆桩——","Chatting thus, Pencroft, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert got on board and looked about the deck of the “Bonadventure.”All at once, the sailor having examined the bitts to which the cable of the anchor was secured,—"
"他突然喊起来：“啊呀，太奇怪了！”","“Hallo,” he cried, “this is queer!”"
"“怎么了，潘克洛夫？”通讯记者问。","“What is the matter, Pencroft?” asked the reporter."
"“你看，这个结不是我打的！”","“The matter is, that it was not I who made this knot!”"
"潘克洛夫指着一根把缆绳系在系缆桩上的绳子。","And Pencroft showed a rope which fastened the cable to the bitt itself."
"“什么，结不是你打的？”吉迪恩·史佩莱问道。","“What, it was not you?” asked Gideon Spilett."
"“不是！我可以发誓。这是一个平结，我打的可都是活扣。”","“No!I can swear to it.This is a reef knot, and I always make a running bowline.”"
"“你肯定记错了，潘克洛夫。”","“You must be mistaken, Pencroft.”"
"“我没有记错！”水手说，“我的手不自觉地就系成活扣，一个人的手是不会出错的！”","“I am not mistaken!” declared the sailor.“My hand does it so naturally, and one’s hand is never mistaken!”"
"“那么，难道罪犯们上过船？”赫伯特问。","“Then can the convicts have been on board?” asked Herbert."
"“那我不清楚，”潘克洛夫回答，“可是有一点很确定，就是有人拔过锚，又把它抛了下去！看看这儿，这儿还有一个证据！锚缆被抽了出来，卷索不在锚链孔里了。我再说一遍，有人用过我们的船了！”","“I know nothing about that,” answered Pencroft, “but what is certain, is that some one has weighed the ‘Bonadventure’s’ anchor and dropped it again!And look here, here is another proof!The cable of the anchor has been run out, and its service is no longer at the hawse-hole.I repeat that some one has been using our vessel!”"
"“可是，要是那些罪犯用过，他们会把船抢走，或者干脆乘着船逃跑。”","“But if the convicts had used her, they would have pillaged her, or rather gone off with her.”"
"“逃跑！逃到哪儿——逃到达抱岛？”潘克洛夫回答道，“你觉得，他们会坐着这么小吨位的船去冒险？”","“Gone off! where to—to Tabor Island?” replied Pencroft.“Do you think, they would risk themselves in a boat of such small tonnage?”"
"“另外，他们还不一定知道有那个小岛呢。”通讯记者附和道。","“We must, besides, be sure that they know of the islet,” rejoined the reporter."
"“不管他们知道还是不知道，”水手说，“就像我生在葡萄园，名字叫潘克洛夫一样没错，我们的‘乘风破浪号’已经在我们不在的情况下，被别人航行过了！”","“However that may be,” said the sailor, “as sure as my name is Bonadventure Pencroft, of the Vineyard, our ‘Bonadventure’ has sailed without us!”"
"水手很确定，吉迪恩·史佩莱和赫伯特都提不出质疑。很明显，自从潘克洛夫把特船带到气球港后，船多多少少被人移动过。至于说水手，他有百分之百的把握，有人拔过锚，然后又把锚抛了下去。那么，要不是乘船航行，做这两道工序还有什么目的？","The sailor was positive that neither Gideon Spilett nor Herbert could dispute his statement.It was evident that the vessel had been moved, more or less, since Pencroft had brought her to Port Balloon.As to the sailor, he had not the slightest doubt that the anchor had been raised and then dropped again.Now, what was the use of these two maneuvers, unless the vessel had been employed in some expedition?"
"“可是，我们在岛上怎么没看见‘乘风破浪号’经过呢？”通讯记者说，他急切地想把每一个可能驳斥上面的观点的事实说出来。","“But how was it we did not see the ‘Bonadventure’ pass in the sight of the island?” observed the reporter, who was anxious to bring forward every possible objection."
"“怎么，史佩莱先生，”水手回答，“他们只需要在夜里顺风顺水的时候动身，用不了两个钟头，就开出海岛的视线喽。”","“Why, Mr. Spilett,” replied the sailor, “they would only have to start in the night with a good breeze, and they would be out of sight of the island in two hours.”"
"“好吧，”吉迪恩·史佩莱又说，“我还有问题：那些罪犯们使用‘乘风破浪号’有什么目的，还有，用完以后，他们为什么又把船开回港口？”","“Well,” resumed Gideon Spilett, “I ask again, what object could the convicts have had in using the ‘Bonadventure,’ and why, after they had made use of her, should they have brought her back to port?”"
"“好了，史佩莱先生，”水手回答，“我们得把这些问题归于无法解释的那一类，就不要再费脑筋了。最主要的是‘乘风破浪号’在这儿，它现在还在这儿。一旦罪犯们第二次把它劫走——那太倒霉了——我们就别指望在这儿再找到它！”","“Why, Mr. Spilett,” replied the sailor, “we must put that among the unaccountable things, and not think anything more about it.The chief thing is that the ‘Bonadventure’ was there, and she is there now.Only, unfortunately, if the convicts take her a second time, we shall very likely not find her again in her place!”"
"“潘克洛夫，这样的话，”赫伯特说，“把船带到‘花岗石宫’去，岂不最好？”","“Then, Pencroft,” said Herbert, “would it not be wisest to bring the ‘Bonadventure’ off to Granite House?”"
"“也好也不好，”潘克洛夫回答，“或者干脆就不行。慈悲河河口不适合船只停泊，那里的潮水太猛。”","“Yes and no,” answered Pencroft, “or rather no.The mouth of the Mercy is a bad place for a vessel, and the sea is heavy there.”"
"“那把船停在“石窟”脚下的沙滩上如何？”","“But by hauling her up on the sand, to the foot of the Chimneys?”"
"“那样也许倒不错，”潘克洛夫回答，“不管怎么样，既然我们得离开‘花岗石宫’做一次远途探险，我觉得‘乘风破浪号’在我们不在的时候留在这儿会更安全一点儿，在清除岛上的那些混蛋以前，我们最好还是把船放在这里。”“我正是这么想的，”通讯记者说，“无论如何，天气恶劣的时侯，藏在这儿总比暴露在慈悲河河口好。”","“Perhaps yes,” replied Pencroft.“At any rate, since we must leave Granite House for a long expedition, I think the ‘Bonadventure’ will be safer here during our absence, and we shall do best to leave her here until the island is rid of these blackguards.”“That is exactly my opinion,” said the reporter.“At any rate in the event of bad weather, she will not be exposed here as she would be at the mouth of the Mercy.”"
"“可是，如果罪犯们再次光顾怎么办？”赫伯特说。","“But suppose the convicts pay her another visit,” said Herbert."
"“好了，孩子，”潘克洛夫说，“如果他们看到船不在这儿，用不了多久就会在‘花岗石宫’的沙滩上找到它的！况且，我们不在的时候，他们可以毫不费力地把船劫走！所以，我和史佩莱先生的观点一样，就是必须把船留在气球港。不过，要是回来的时候，我们还没把那伙混蛋从岛上清除掉，谨慎起见，我们还是把船带到‘花岗石宫’，直到再也不用担心有什么不速之客的时候再说。”","“Well, my boy,” replied Pencroft, “not finding her here, they would not be long in finding her on the sands of Granite House, and, during our absence, nothing could hinder them from seizing her!I agree, therefore, with Mr. Spilett, that she must be left in Port Balloon.But, if on our return we have not rid the island of those rascals, it will be prudent to bring our boat to Granite House, until the time when we need not fear any unpleasant visits.”"
"“就这么决定了。我们走吧。”通讯记者说。","“That’s settled.Let us be off,” said the reporter."
"潘克洛夫、赫伯特和吉迪恩·史佩莱回到花岗石宫以后，把全部经过都告诉了工程师，工程师对他们对目前以及将来的安排都表示赞同。他还对水手许诺，要研究一下小岛和海岸之间的海峡，看看能不能利用水坝在那里建一个人工港。这样的话，“乘风破浪号”就等于放在移民们的眼皮子底下了，随时可以照管它，必要的时候，甚至可以把它锁起来。","Pencroft, Herbert, and Gideon Spilett, on their return to Granite House, told the engineer all that had passed, and the latter approved of their arrangements both for the present and the future.He also promised the sailor that he would study that part of the channel situated between the islet and the coast, so as to ascertain if it would not be possible to make an artificial harbor there by means of dams.In this way, the “Bonadventure” would be always within reach, under the eyes of the colonists, and if necessary, under lock and key."
"当天晚上，他们给艾尔顿打了一个电报，让他从畜栏带两只山羊回来，纳布想使它们适应高地的水土。非常奇怪的是，这次电报发出后，艾尔顿没有像往常一样，回复收到电报。这不免令工程师觉得诧异。不过，也许艾尔顿那时正好不在畜栏，甚至他已经在回花岗石宫的路上了。事实上，艾尔顿已经在畜栏呆了两天，大家原先决定，他应该在10号晚上或者最晚11号早晨回来。于是，移民们在眺望岗上等待着艾尔顿。纳布和赫伯特甚至在桥边守望着，打算等他们的同伴一出现，就把吊桥放下。","That evening a telegram was sent to Ayrton, requesting him to bring from the corral a couple of goats, which Neb wished to acclimatize to the plateau.Singularly enough, Ayrton did not acknowledge the receipt of the despatch, as he was accustomed to do.This could not but astonish the engineer.But it might be that Ayrton was not at that moment in the corral, or even that he was on his way back to Granite House.In fact, two days had already passed since his departure, and it had been decided that on the evening of the 10th or at the latest the morning of the 11th, he should return.The colonists waited, therefore, for Ayrton to appear on Prospect Heights.Neb and Herbert even watched at the bridge so as to be ready to lower it the moment their companion presented himself."
"然而，一直到晚上十点，艾尔顿还没回来。于是，移民们决定最好再打一个电报，要求对方立即回复。","But up to ten in the evening, there were no signs of Ayrton.It was, therefore, judged best to send a fresh despatch, requiring an immediate reply."
"可是，花岗石宫的电报铃却一直没有响。","The bell of the telegraph at Granite House remained mute."
"移民们坐立不安起来。出了什么事吗？艾尔顿不在畜栏了吗，还是他仍然在那儿，但是不能自由行动了呢？他们能在这么黑的夜里赶往畜栏吗？","The colonists’ uneasiness was great.What had happened?Was Ayrton no longer at the corral, or if he was still there, had he no longer control over his movements?Could they go to the corral in this dark night?"
"大伙儿商议了一下。有人想去，有人说再等一等。","They consulted.Some wished to go, the others to remain."
"“可是，”赫伯特说，“或许电报装置出了什么故障，所以接收不了电报了呢？”","“But,” said Herbert, “perhaps some accident has happened to the telegraphic apparatus, so that it works no longer?”"
"“有可能。”通讯记者说。","“That may be,” said the reporter."
"“等到明天早上吧。”赛勒斯·哈丁说，“确实有可能艾尔顿没收到我们的电报，或者我们干脆没收到他的。”","“Wait till to-morrow,” replied Cyrus Harding.“It is possible, indeed, that Ayrton has not received our despatch, or even that we have not received his.”"
"大家等待着，心情自然非常焦急。","They waited, of course not without some anxiety."
"第二天，11月11号，天刚亮，哈丁又打了一个电报，还是没有回答。","At dawn of day, the 11th of November, Harding again sent the electric current along the wire and received no reply."
"他又试了一次，结果还是一样。","He tried again: the same result."
"“去畜栏！”他说。","“Off to the corral,” said he."
"“带好武器！”潘克洛夫补充道。","“And well armed!” added Pencroft."
"大伙儿马上想到，花岗石宫不能没人，纳布应该留下来。纳布把同伴们送到甘油河畔后，把吊桥扯了起来；然后在一棵树后等待着同伴们或是艾尔顿的归来。","It was immediately decided that Granite House should not be left alone and that Neb should remain there.After having accompanied his friends to Creek Glycerine, he raised the bridge; and waiting behind a tree he watched for the return of either his companions or Ayrton."
"如果海盗们露面了，想要强行过河，他会开枪阻止他们，万不得已的时候，他还能逃回花岗石宫，只要把升降梯升起来，他就安全了。","In the event of the pirates presenting themselves and attempting to force the passage, he was to endeavor to stop them by firing on them, and as a last resource he was to take refuge in Granite House, where, the lift once raised, he would be in safety."
"赛勒斯·哈丁、吉迪恩·史佩莱、赫伯特和潘克洛夫赶往畜栏，如果找不到艾尔顿，他们就到附近的森林里去找。","Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, and Pencroft were to repair to the corral, and if they did not find Ayrton, search the neighboring woods."
"早上六点的时候，工程师和三个同伴过了甘油河，纳布藏在河左岸的一个长满龙血树的小土丘后面。","At six o’clock in the morning, the engineer and his three companions had passed Creek Glycerine, and Neb posted himself behind a small mound crowned by several dragon trees, on the left bank of the stream."
"移民们离开眺望岗的高地后，径直踏上了通往畜栏的小路。他们扛着枪，一有哪怕一丁点儿对他们不利的事情，就会随时开枪。两只步枪和两只滑膛枪都装满了弹药。","The colonists, after leaving the plateau of Prospect Heights, immediately took the road to the corral.They shouldered their guns, ready to fire on the slightest hostile demonstration.The two rifles and the two guns had been loaded with ball."
"小路两边都是浓密的森林，罪犯们在里面藏身轻而易举，而且他们还有武器，因此确实很难对付。","The wood was thick on each side of the road and might easily have concealed the convicts, who owing to their weapons would have been really formidable."
"移民们快步走着，没有人说话。托普在他们前面，时而在路上跑，时而钻进林子里，不过，它一路上都很安静，看起来没有遇到什么奇怪的事情。他们相信这只忠诚的狗绝不会让他们受到惊吓，而是稍稍感觉到危险，就会大叫起来的。","The colonists walked rapidly and in silence.Top preceded them, sometimes running on the road, sometimes taking a ramble into the wood, but always quiet and not appearing to fear anything unusual.And they could be sure that the faithful dog would not allow them to be surprised, but would bark at the least appearance of danger."
"赛勒斯·哈丁和同伴们沿着路旁连接畜栏和花岗石宫的电线向前走着。走了差不多两英里，他们还没有发现任何解释疑问的地方。电线杆好好地竖在那儿，电线也照常拉着。然而，这时候工程师发现电线看起来松松的，到了第74号电线杆时，赶在前面的赫伯特突然停住了脚步，喊道：","Cyrus Harding and his companions followed beside the road the wire which connected the corral with Granite House.After walking for nearly two miles, they had not as yet discovered any explanation of the difficulty.The posts were in good order, the wire regularly extended.However, at that moment the engineer observed that the wire appeared to be slack, and on arriving at post No.74, Herbert, who was in advance stopped, exclaiming,—"
"“电线断了！”","“The wire is broken!”"
"同伴们赶紧上前去，来到孩子站住的地方。电线杆被连根拔起，倒在路上。这个就是解释疑问的意想不到的答案。显然，畜栏没收到花岗石宫发来的电报，同样，花岗石宫也收不到畜栏打出的电报。","His companions hurried forward and arrived at the spot where the lad was standing.The post was rooted up and lying across the path.The unexpected explanation of the difficulty was here, and it was evident that the despatches from Granite House had not been received at the corral, nor those from the corral at Granite House."
"“不是风刮倒电线杆的。”潘克洛夫观察后说。","“It wasn’t the wind that blew down this post,” observed Pencroft."
"“不是风，”吉迪恩·史佩莱回答，“根部周围的土都被挖起来了，是有人把电线杆拔了出来。”","“No,” replied Gideon Spilett.“The earth has been dug up round its foot, and it has been torn up by the hand of man.”"
"“而且，电线也断了。”赫伯特指着被掐断的电线补充道。","“Besides, the wire is broken,” added Herbert, showing that the wire had been snapped."
"“是刚弄断的吗？”哈丁问。","“Is the fracture recent?” asked Harding."
"“嗯，”赫伯特回答，“肯定是不久之前才弄断的。”","“Yes,” answered Herbert, “it has certainly been done quite lately.”"
"“到畜栏去！赶紧去畜栏！”水手叫。","“To the corral! to the corral!” exclaimed the sailor."
"移民们现在才走了花岗石宫和畜栏之间一半的路程，离畜栏还有两英里半。他们奋力向前，速度比原来快了一倍。","The colonists were now half way between Granite House and the corral, having still two miles and a half to go.They pressed forward with redoubled speed."
"确实，大伙儿担心畜栏发生了什么严重的意外。毫无疑问，艾尔顿可能打过电报，只是他们没收到，不过，同伴们如此担忧并不是因为这个，而是因为一件更加令人费解的事情，即：艾尔顿答应在昨天晚上回来，结果却没有没有回来。总之，畜栏和花岗石宫的所有通信中断并非无意为之，若不是那些罪犯，谁还能有意破坏他们之间的通讯？","Indeed, it was to be feared that some serious accident had occurred in the corral.No doubt, Ayrton might have sent a telegram which had not arrived, but this was not the reason why his companions were so uneasy, for, a more unaccountable circumstance, Ayrton, who had promised to return the evening before, had not reappeared.In short, it was not without a motive that all communication had been stopped between the corral and Granite House, and who but the convicts could have any interest in interrupting this communication?"
"移民们急匆匆地赶路，心里充满了忧虑。他们衷心地喜欢这个新来的同伴。他们会不会发现他被以前的党羽亲手杀害了呢？","The settlers hastened on, their hearts oppressed with anxiety.They were sincerely attached to their new companion.Were they to find him struck down by the hands of those of whom he was formerly the leader?"
"他们很快达到了通向一条小河岸边的道路旁，河水是从红河流出来的，浇灌了畜栏的牧场。这时，大伙儿放慢了步子，以免在必须决斗的时候，喘不过气来。他们的手指都扣着枪的扳机。大伙儿注视着两旁的密林。托普发出低吼声，好像是预告要有不幸的事情发生。","Soon they arrived at the place where the road led along the side of the little stream which flowed from the Red Creek and watered the meadows of the corral.They then moderated their pace so that they should not be out of breath at the moment when a struggle might be necessary.Their guns were in their hands ready cocked.The forest was watched on every side.Top uttered sullen groans which were rather ominous."
"终于，畜栏的木栅栏从树木中显现出来。看不到什么遭到破坏的迹象。门像往常一样关着。死寂笼罩着畜栏。既听不见平日咩咩的羊叫，也听不见艾尔顿的声音。","At last the palisade appeared through the trees.No trace of any damage could be seen.The gate was shut as usual.Deep silence reigned in the corral.Neither the accustomed bleating of the sheep nor Ayrton’s voice could be heard."
"“我们进去。”塞勒斯·哈丁说。","“Let us enter,” said Cyrus Harding."
"工程师往前走，他的同伴们在二十步以外跟着他，时刻警惕着，一有动静，就立即开枪。","And the engineer advanced, while his companions, keeping watch about twenty paces behind him, were ready to fire at a moment’s notice."
"哈丁拔开里面的门闩，刚要推进去，这时，托普大声叫起来。只听“砰”一声，紧接着是一声惨叫。","Harding raised the inner latch of the gate and was about to push it back, when Top barked loudly.A report sounded and was responded to by a cry of pain."
"一颗子弹打中了赫伯特，他直挺挺地倒在地上。","Herbert, struck by a bullet, lay stretched on the ground."
"第七章","Chapter 7"
"一听到赫伯特的惨叫声，潘克洛夫连忙冲上去，手里的枪都丢到了地上。","At Herbert’s cry, Pencroft, letting his gun fall, rushed towards him."
"“他们把他打死了！”他喊着，“我的孩子！他们把他打死了！”","“They have killed him!” he cried.“My boy!They have killed him!”"
"赛勒斯·哈丁和吉迪恩·史佩莱也跑向赫伯特。","Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett ran to Herbert."
"通讯记者俯下身子，想听听这个可怜的孩子还有没有心跳。","The reporter listened to ascertain if the poor lad’s heart was still beating."
"“他还活着，”他说，“不过，我们必须得把他送回——”","“He lives,” said he, “but he must be carried—”"
"“回‘花岗石宫’？那不可能！”工程师回答。","“To Granite House? that is impossible!” replied the engineer."
"“那么，抬到畜栏里去！”潘克洛夫说。","“Into the corral, then!” said Pencroft."
"“等等。”哈丁说。","“In a moment,” said Harding."
"他绕过木栅栏的左角。就在那里，他看见一个罪犯正举着枪对准自己，一枪开来，子弹打穿了他的帽子。几秒钟后，还没等罪犯开第二枪，哈丁就用匕首刺中了他的心脏，这一刀可比枪打的还准，罪犯立马倒下了。","And he ran round the left corner of the palisade.There he found a convict, who aiming at him, sent a ball through his hat.In a few seconds, before he had even time to fire his second barrel, he fell, struck to the heart by Harding’s dagger, more sure even than his gun."
"在这时候，吉迪恩·史佩莱和水手翻过栅栏，跳到畜栏里面，拉开里门的门杠，冲进空屋去，很快，可怜的赫伯特就躺在了艾尔顿的床上。不一会儿，哈丁也来到了赫伯特的身边。","During this time, Gideon Spilett and the sailor hoisted themselves over the palisade, leaped into the enclosure, threw down the props which supported the inner door, ran into the empty house, and soon, poor Herbert was lying on Ayrton’s bed.In a few moments, Harding was by his side."
"看见赫伯特没了知觉，水手悲痛欲绝。","On seeing Herbert senseless, the sailor’s grief was terrible."
"他先是抽泣，继而嚎啕大哭，还把脑袋往墙上撞。","He sobbed, he cried, he tried to beat his head against the wall."
"工程师和通讯记者都安抚不了他。他们自己也悲痛地难以自已，说不出话来。","Neither the engineer nor the reporter could calm him.They themselves were choked with emotion.They could not speak."
"不过，他们知道还得靠他们，把眼前受苦的这个可怜的孩子从死神手里救出来。吉迪恩·史佩莱稍懂医药，不然，怎么会历经众多劫难却依然大难不死？他什么都知道一点儿，有几次，他还被安排医治刀伤和枪伤。在赛勒斯·哈丁的帮助下，他开始对赫伯特进行抢救。","However, they knew that it depended on them to rescue from death the poor boy who was suffering beneath their eyes.Gideon Spilett had not passed through the many incidents by which his life had been checkered without acquiring some slight knowledge of medicine.He knew a little of everything, and several times he had been obliged to attend to wounds produced either by a sword-bayonet or shot.Assisted by Cyrus Harding, he proceeded to render the aid Herbert required."
"通讯记者一上来就大吃一惊，因为赫伯特躺在那儿，完全不省人事，一是由于出血过多，二是由于受到的巨大的冲击，子弹力量很猛，打中了一块骨头，造成了强烈的震荡。","The reporter was immediately struck by the complete stupor in which Herbert lay, a stupor owing either to the hemorrhage, or to the shock, the ball having struck a bone with sufficient force to produce a violent concussion."
"赫伯特面色惨白，脉搏若隐若现，要隔很长时间史佩莱才能感觉到它跳动一次，似乎几乎就要停止了。","Herbert was deadly pale, and his pulse so feeble that Spilett only felt it beat at long intervals, as if it was on the point of stopping."
"症状非常危急。","These symptoms were very serious."
"大伙儿把赫伯特的胸膛露出来，用在冷水中浸过的手帕为他止了血。","Herbert’s chest was laid bare, and the blood having been stanched with handkerchiefs, it was bathed with cold water."
"大伙儿快看见伤口了——在胸膛以下第三根与第四根肋骨之间有一个椭圆形的窟窿。这就是赫伯特身上被子弹击中的地方。","The contusion, or rather the contused wound appeared,—an oval below the chest between the third and fourth ribs.It was there that Herbert had been hit by the bullet."
"然后，赛勒斯·哈丁和吉迪恩·史佩莱把可怜的孩子的身体翻过来，翻身的时候，赫伯特发出一声微弱的呻吟，大伙儿差一点以为这是他将死之前的叹息了。","Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett then turned the poor boy over; as they did so, he uttered a moan so feeble that they almost thought it was his last sigh."
"他的后背还有一处伤口，背上满是血，子弹就是从这儿打穿出去的。","Herberts back was covered with blood from another contused wound, by which the ball had immediately escaped."
"“感谢上帝！”通讯记者说，“子弹没有在身体里，我们不必把它取出来了。”","“God be praised!” said the reporter, “the ball is not in the body, and we shall not have to extract it.”"
"“有没有伤着心脏？”哈丁问。","“But the heart?” asked Harding."
"“子弹没有打到心脏，不然，赫伯特早死了！”","“The heart has not been touched; if it had been, Herbert would be dead!”"
"“死了！”潘克洛夫呻吟了一声。","“Dead!” exclaimed Pencroft, with a groan."
"水手只听见通讯记者说的最后这两个字了。","The sailor had only heard the last words uttered by the reporter."
"“没有，潘克洛夫，”赛勒斯·哈丁对他说道，“没有！他没死。他的脉搏还在跳动。他不是还呻吟了一声？不过，为了你的孩子着想，让自己冷静下来。我们必须非常镇静。”","“No, Pencroft,” replied Cyrus Harding, “no!He is not dead.His pulse still beats.He has even uttered a moan.But for your boy’s sake, calm yourself.We have need of all our self-possession.”"
"“不要让我们沉不住气，朋友。”","“Do not make us lose it, my friend.”"
"潘克洛夫什么也没说，他的反应是，大滴的泪珠从他的脸颊上滚落下来。","Pencroft was silent, but a reaction set in, and great tears rolled down his cheeks."
"这时，吉迪恩·史佩莱努力集中精力，继续对赫伯特进行医治。仔细检查了一遍以后，他确定了子弹是从前胸第七根和第八根肋骨间打进去的，然后从后面第三根和第四根肋骨间穿了出来。但是，子弹在这个过程中造成什么破坏？它伤到了那些重要的器官？专业的外科医生立刻回答这些问题都有困难，何况是通讯记者了。","In the meanwhile, Gideon Spilett endeavored to collect his ideas, and proceed methodically.After his examination he had no doubt that the ball, entering in front, between the seventh and eighth ribs, had issued behind between the third and fourth.But what mischief had the ball committed in its passage?What important organs had been reached?A professional surgeon would have had difficulty in determining this at once, and still more so the reporter."
"不过，有一点他很清楚，就是必须阻止伤口发炎造成血脉不通，然后同伤口——或许是致命的——引发的局部炎症和高烧作斗争！现在，要用什么来止血和消炎呢？怎样才能阻止伤口发炎呢？","However, he knew one thing, this was that he would have to prevent the inflammatory strangulation of the injured parts, then to contend with the local inflammation and fever which would result from the wound, perhaps mortal!Now, what styptics, what antiphiogistics ought to be employed?By what means could inflammation be prevented?"
"不管怎样，最要紧的事是立刻把两处伤口包扎起来。为防止赫伯特再次出血，吉迪恩·史佩莱认为不必再用温水洗一遍伤口，也不必挤压伤口。赫伯特流了很多血，身体因为失血过多已经变得很虚弱。","At any rate, the most important thing was that the two wounds should be dressed without delay.It did not appear necessary to Gideon Spilett that a fresh flow of blood should be caused by bathing them in tepid water, and compressing their lips.The hemorrhage had been very abundant, and Herbert was already too much enfeebled by the loss of blood."
"因此，通讯记者认为最好简单地用冷水擦拭一下两处伤口。","The reporter, therefore, thought it best to simply bathe the two wounds with cold water."
"大伙儿把赫伯特侧翻过来，朝左边躺着，让他保持着这个姿势。","Herbert was placed on his left side, and was maintained in that position."
"“不能再动他。”吉迪恩·史佩莱说，“这样躺着最有助于他后背和前胸的伤口排脓，他现在需要绝对的休息。”","“He must not be moved.” said Gideon Spilett.“He is in the most favorable position for the wounds in his back and chest to suppurate easily, and absolute rest is necessary.”"
"“什么！我们不能把他送回‘花岗石宫’吗？”潘克洛夫问。","“What! can’t we carry him to Granite House?” asked Pencroft."
"“不行，潘克洛夫。”通讯记者回答。","“No, Pencroft,” replied the reporter."
"“我要让那帮混蛋血债血还！”水手大声说，威胁地挥舞着拳头。","“I’ll pay the villains off!” cried the sailor, shaking his fist in a menacing manner."
"“潘克洛夫！”赛勒斯·哈丁说。","“Pencroft!” said Cyrus Harding."
"吉迪恩·史佩莱继续检查起受伤的孩子的身体。赫伯特依然脸色惨白得令人害怕，通讯记者非常忧虑。","Gideon Spilett had resumed his examination of the wounded boy.Herbert was still so frightfully pale, that the reporter felt anxious."
"“赛勒斯，”他说道，“我不是个外科医生。我现在很茫然。你得给我建议，以你的经验协助我！”","“Cyrus,” said he, “I am not a surgeon.I am in terrible perplexity.You must aid me with your advice, your experience!”"
"“鼓起勇气来，我的朋友，”工程师紧紧地握着通讯记者的手，说道，“冷静地判断。脑子里就想一件事：一定要救活赫伯特！”","“Take courage, my friend,” answered the engineer, pressing the reporter’s hand.“Judge coolly.Think only of this: Herbert must be saved!”"
"这几句话让吉迪恩·史佩莱恢复了镇静。他刚才因为感到肩上沉重的责任，一度灰心丧气，慌张起来。他紧挨床坐着。赛勒斯·哈丁站在旁边。潘克洛夫把自己的衬衫撕破了，机械地做着包扎要用的软麻布。","These words restored to Gideon Spilett that self-possession which he had lost in a moment of discouragement on feeling his great responsibility.He seated himself close to the bed.Cyrus Harding stood near.Pencroft had torn up his shirt, and was mechanically making lint."
"史佩莱向赛勒斯·哈丁解释说，他认为他应该首先把血止住，而不是把两处伤口缝合，或使它们快点结疤，因为子弹打穿了内脏，不能让脓液积聚在胸腔内。","Spilett then explained to Cyrus Harding that he thought he ought first of all to stop the hemorrhage, but not close the two wounds, or cause their immediate cicatrization, for there had been internal perforation, and the suppuration must not be allowed to accumulate in the chest."
"哈丁完全同意，于是通讯记者决定，先把伤口包起来，不用立即缝合。","Harding approved entirely, and it was decided that the two wounds should be dressed without attempting to close them by immediate coaptation."
"那么，现在，移民们有没有灵药来对付可能出现的炎症呢？","And now did the colonists possess an efficacious agent to act against the inflammation which might occur?"
"有！他们有一种灵药，大自然慷慨地赐予了他们。他们有冷水，这是治疗伤口发炎的最管用的镇静剂，对付危急病症的最有疗效的灵药，现在的医生没有一个不在用它。此外，冷水还有一个好处，它能使伤口得到彻底的休息，能在所有过早地包扎伤口的情况下保护伤口，这点很有用，因为根据经验，受伤最初的几天，伤口与空气接触是很危险的。","Yes.They had one, for nature had generously lavished it.They had cold water, that is to say, the most powerful sedative that can be employed against inflammation of wounds, the most efficacious therapeutic agent in grave cases, and the one which is now adopted by all physicians.Cold water has, moreover, the advantage of leaving the wound in absolute rest, and preserving it from all premature dressing, a considerable advantage, since it has been found by experience that contact with the air is dangerous during the first days."
"吉迪恩·史佩莱和赛勒斯·哈丁用他们简单而有条理的思维这样推断着，他们做的不输给最优秀的外科医生。他们把用软麻布做的敷布敷在可怜的赫伯特的两处伤口上，不断地用冷水把布浸湿。","Gideon Spilett and Cyrus Harding reasoned thus with their simple good sense, and they acted as the best surgeon would have done.Compresses of linen were applied to poor Herbert’s two wounds, and were kept constantly wet with cold water."
"水手一开始就在小木屋里生了一把火，屋里各种生活必需品都一应俱全。大伙儿用槭糖、各种药草——就是赫伯特在格兰特湖边找到的那些种子——熬了一些可以振奋精神的汤水，他们喂赫伯特喝下去，孩子一点儿知觉也没有。他发着高烧，一整天过去了，他还是没醒过来。","The sailor had at first lighted a fire in the hut, which was not wanting in things necessary for life.Maple sugar, medicinal plants, the same which the lad had gathered on the banks of Lake Grant, enabled them to make some refreshing drinks, which they gave him without his taking any notice of it.His fever was extremely high, and all that day and night passed without his becoming conscious."
"赫伯特命悬一线，而且这根线随时都可能断了。第二天，11月12号，哈丁和同伴们重新燃起了一线希望。赫伯特经过长时间的昏迷后，醒过来了。他睁开眼睛，认出了赛勒斯·哈丁、通讯记者和潘克洛夫。他说了两三个字。他不知道发生了什么事。大伙儿把事情的经过告诉了他，史佩莱恳求他绝对不要动，跟他说已经没有生命危险，伤口过几天就会痊愈的。赫伯特几乎再没受什么苦，因为伤口常用冷水擦拭，所以没有发炎。排脓进行得很正常，体温也没有上升，大伙儿现在希望这次可怕的枪伤不会带来任何灾难。潘克洛夫觉得他的心也慢慢放下来了。他就像一个慈爱的修女，像一个坐在爱子床边的母亲。","Herbert’s life hung on a thread, and this thread might break at any moment.The next day, the 12th of November, the hopes of Harding and his companions slightly revived.Herbert had come out of his long stupor.He opened his eyes, he recognized Cyrus Harding, the reporter, and Pencroft.He uttered two or three words.He did not know what had happened.They told him, and Spilett begged him to remain perfectly still, telling him that his life was not in danger, and that his wounds would heal in a few days.However, Herbert scarcely suffered at all, and the cold water with which they were constantly bathed, prevented any inflammation of the wounds.The suppuration was established in a regular way, the fever did not increase, and it might now be hoped that this terrible wound would not involve any catastrophe.Pencroft felt the swelling of his heart gradually subside.He was like a sister of mercy. like a mother by the bed of her child."
"赫伯特又开始打瞌睡，不过，这次他是自然地进入了梦乡。","Herbert dozed again, but his sleep appeared more natural."
"“再跟我说一遍你有信心，史佩莱先生，”潘克洛夫说，“再说一遍你能救活赫伯特！”","“Tell me again that you hope, Mr. Spilett,” said Pencroft.“Tell me again that you will save Herbert!”"
"“是，我们能把他救活！”通讯记者说，“伤势很严重，有可能子弹都打穿了肺，不过，肺部的穿孔不会危及生命。”","“Yes, we will save him!” replied the reporter.“The wound is serious, and, perhaps, even the ball has traversed the lungs, but the perforation of this organ is not fatal.”"
"“上帝保佑你！”潘克洛夫说。","“God bless you!” answered Pencroft."
"可以相信，在这二十四小时里，移民们一直呆在畜栏里，心思全花在了照顾赫伯特上面。他们既没有考虑万一罪犯们回来，他们会面临什么样的危险，也没考虑将来要采取什么预防措施。","As may be believed, during the four-and-twenty hours they had been in the corral, the colonists had no other thought than that of nursing Herbert.They did not think either of the danger which threatened them should the convicts return, or of the precautions to be taken for the future."
"但这天，当潘克洛夫坐在病床前照顾病人时，赛勒斯·哈丁和通讯记者商议着眼下最好怎么办。","But on this day, while Pencroft watched by the sick-bed, Cyrus Harding and the reporter consulted as to what it would be best to do."
"他们首先查看了一遍畜栏。连艾尔顿的影子也没看见。是不是这个不幸的人让以前的党羽拖走了？是不是他反抗过，但在打斗中敌不过那帮家伙儿？最后这个假设很有可能。吉迪恩·史佩莱爬上栅栏的时候，曾清清楚楚地看见一个罪犯沿着富兰克林山南边的支脉逃跑，托普朝着他冲过去了。慈悲河河口的岩石曾撞坏了罪犯们的小船，也把他们的企图撞得灰飞烟灭，这个逃跑的罪犯就是他们当中的一员。另外，密斯刺死的那个罪犯，还躺在围栏外面，自然也是鲍勃·哈维的手下。","First of all they examined the corral.There was not a trace of Ayrton.Had the unhappy man been dragged away by his former accomplices?Had he resisted, and been overcome in the struggle?This last supposition was only too probable.Gideon Spilett, at the moment he scaled the palisade, had clearly seen some one of the convicts running along the southern spur of Mount Franklin, towards whom Top had sprung.It was one of those whose object had been so completely defeated by the rocks at the mouth of the Mercy.Besides, the one killed by Harding, and whose body was found outside the enclosure, of course belonged to Bob Harvey’s crew."
"畜栏倒是没有遭到任何破坏。门关着，牲畜也没有逃散到森林中去。他们在屋子里和栅栏里边都没有看到任何打斗或者遭到破坏的迹象。唯独艾尔顿的武器和他一块儿消失了。","As to the corral, it had not suffered any damage.The gates were closed, and the animals had not been able to disperse in the forest.Nor could they see traces of any struggle, any devastation, either in the hut, or in the palisade.The ammunition only, with which Ayrton had been supplied, had disappeared with him."
"“那个不幸的人被突袭了，”哈丁说，“他是一个会保护自己的人，肯定是最后抵挡不住了。”","“The unhappy man has been surprised,” said Harding, “and as he was a man to defend himself, he must have been overpowered.”"
"“嗯，恐怕正是这样。”通讯记者说，“那么，毫无疑问，罪犯们发现畜栏里应有尽有，就在这儿住下了，只是看见我们来了才逃跑的。同样显而易见的是，这时艾尔顿不管是死是活，并不在这儿！”","“Yes, that is to be feared!” said the reporter.“Then, doubtless, the convicts installed themselves in the corral where they found plenty of everything, and only fled when they saw us coming.It is very evident, too, that at this moment Ayrton, whether living or dead, is not here!”"
"“我们到森林里去搜索，”工程师说，“把那帮无耻的混蛋从岛上清除出去。潘克洛夫当时想要像猎捕猛兽那样追击罪犯们，他的预感是正确的。要是早那么做，所有不幸的事根本不会发生！”","“We shall have to beat the forest,” said the engineer, “and rid the island of these wretches.Pencroft’s presentiments were not mistaken, when he wished to hunt them as wild beasts.That would have spared us all these misfortunes!”"
"“是啊，”通讯记者说，“现在可是他们逼得我们冷酷无情的！”","“Yes,” answered the reporter, “but now we have the right to be merciless!”"
"“不管怎样，”工程师说，“我们要继续呆在畜栏里等上一段时间，等到能把赫伯特安全地送回‘花岗石宫’再行动。”","“At any rate,” said the engineer, “we are obliged to wait some time, and to remain at the corral until we can carry Herbert without danger to Granite House.”"
"“可是纳布呢？”通讯记者问。","“But Neb?” asked the reporter."
"“纳布很安全。”","“Neb is in safety.”"
"“可是，要是他因为我们迟迟未归而不安起来，会不会冒险过来呢？”","“But if, uneasy at our absence, he would venture to come?”"
"“他不能来！”赛勒斯·哈丁立即说，“他会在路上被杀死的！”","“He must not come!” returned Cyrus Harding quickly.“He would be murdered on the road!”"
"“可是，他很可能会来找我们会合的。”","“It is very probable, however, that he will attempt to rejoin us!”"
"“唉，要是电报机还能用，我们就可以给他提个醒了。现在却办不到！我们也不能把潘克洛夫和赫伯特单独留在这儿。好吧，我一个人回一趟‘花岗石宫’。”","“Ah, if the telegraph still acted, he might be warned!But that is impossible now!As to leaving Pencroft and Herbert here alone, we could not do it!Well, I will go alone to Granite House.”"
"“不行，不行！赛勒斯，”通讯记者听了说，“你不能暴露你自己！你的勇气不会起到任何作用。那帮混蛋们显然在关注着畜栏里的一举一动，他们就藏在周围的密林里，要是你离开的话，让我们伤心的不幸的事很快就会由一件变成两件！”","“No, no!Cyrus,” answered the reporter, “you must not expose yourself!Your courage would be of no avail.The villains are evidently watching the corral, they are hidden in the thick woods which surround it, and if you go we shall soon have to regret two misfortunes instead of one!”"
"“可是纳布怎么办？”工程师又说，“他现在整整24小时没收到关于我们的消息了！”他一定会来的！”","“But Neb?” repeated the engineer.“It is now four-and-twenty hours since he has had any news of us!He will be sure to come!”"
"“而且他不会像我们一样小心提防那些罪犯，”史佩莱补充道，“他们会杀了他的！”","“And as he will be less on his guard than we should be ourselves,” added Spilett, “he will be killed!”"
"“难道真的没有办法警告他吗？”","“Is there really no way of warning him?”"
"当工程师考虑的时候，他的目光落在了托普身上，托普走来走去，好像是在说：","While the engineer thought, his eyes fell on Top, who, going backwards and forwards seemed to say,—"
"“我不是在这儿吗？”","“Am not I here?”"
"“托普！”赛勒斯·哈丁叫道。","“Top!” exclaimed Cyrus Harding."
"听到主人叫它，它跳起身来。","The animal sprang at his master’s call."
"“对，托普可以去。”通讯记者说，他明白了工程师的意思。","“Yes, Top will go,” said the reporter, who had understood the engineer."
"“我们不能去的地方，托普能去！他能把畜栏的消息带到‘花岗石宫’，也能把那儿的消息带回给我们！”","“Top can go where we cannot!He will carry to Granite House the news of the corral, and he will bring back to us that from Granite House!”"
"“快点！”哈丁说，“赶快！”","“Quick!” said Harding.“Quick!”"
"史佩莱赶紧从他的笔记本上撕下一页，在上面写道：","Spilett rapidly tore a leaf from his note-book, and wrote these words:—"
"“赫伯特受伤了。我们在畜栏。你要小心。不要离开‘花岗石宫’。罪犯在附近出现过吗？让托普把回复带回来。”","“Herbert wounded.We are at the corral.Be on your guard.Do not leave Granite House.Have the convicts appeared in the neighborhood?Reply by Top.”"
"这张只写着寥寥数语的纸条包含了纳布应该知道的一切，同时也问出了移民们想要知道的一切。他们把纸条折起来，记在托普颈部一个显眼的地方。","This laconic note contained all that Neb ought to know, and at the same time asked all that the colonists wished to know.It was folded and fastened to Top’s collar in a conspicuous position."
"“托普，我的托普，”工程师一边说，一边爱抚着这只畜生，“纳布，托普！纳布！去吧，去吧！”","“Top, my dog,” said the engineer, caressing the animal, “Neb, Top!Neb!Go, go!”"
"听到这些话，托普来回乱跳。他明白工程师的意思，知道大家要他怎么做。他熟悉到畜栏的路，用不了一个钟头，它就能走完这条路，有些地方，不管是赛勒斯·史密斯还是通讯记者经过的时候，都会冒着危险，然而，托普可以不被察觉地从草丛中或树林里穿过。","Top bounded at these words.He understood, he knew what was expected of him.The road to the corral was familiar to him.In less than an hour he could clear it, and it might be hoped that where neither Cyrus Harding nor the reporter could have ventured without danger, Top, running among the grass or in the wood, would pass unperceived."
"工程师走到畜栏门前，打开门。","The engineer went to the gate of the corral and opened it."
"“纳布，托普！纳布！”工程师重复了一遍，又指了指通向花岗石宫的方向。","“Neb, Top!Neb!” repeated the engineer, again pointing in the direction of Granite House."
"托普往前冲去，几乎立刻就看不见踪影了。","Top sprang forwards, then almost immediately disappeared."
"“他会到那儿的！”通讯记者说。","“He will get there!” said the reporter."
"“是的，而且它还会回来，这只忠实的狗！”","“Yes, and he will come back, the faithful animal!”"
"“几点了？”吉迪恩·史佩莱问。","“What o’clock is it?” asked Gideon Spilett."
"“10点。”","“Ten.”"
"“再过一个钟头，他可能就回来了。我们在这守着它回来。”","“In an hour he may be here.We will watch for his return.”"
"他们把畜栏门关上。工程师和通讯记者又回到屋里来。赫伯特还没有醒。潘克洛夫不停地把敷布浸湿。史佩莱看见这时候自己没什么可做的，就忙着准备一些富有营养的食物，同时留心看着靠山的围栏，以防罪犯从那里袭击。","The gate of the corral was closed.The engineer and the reporter re-entered the house.Herbert was still in a sleep.Pencroft kept the compresser always wet.Spilett, seeing there was nothing he could do at that moment, busied himself in preparing some nourishment, while attentively watching that part of the enclosure against the hill, at which an attack might be expected."
"移民们焦急地等待着托普归来。将近11点的时候，塞勒斯·哈丁和通讯记者手里拿着步枪，站在门后，准备一听到狗叫就开门。","The settlers awaited Top’s return with much anxiety.A little before eleven o’clock, Cyrus Harding and the reporter, rifle in hand, were behind the gate, ready to open it at the first bark of their dog."
"他们相信，如果托普平安到达了‘花岗石宫’，纳布一定会立即让它回来的。","They did not doubt that if Top had arrived safely at Granite House, Neb would have sent him back immediately."
"两个人在那儿呆了差不多有十分钟，突然听到了一声枪响，紧接着是不停的狗叫声。","They had both been there for about ten minutes, when a report was heard, followed by repeated barks."
"工程师打开门，看见林子里100英尺远的地方有烟，他朝那里开了一枪。","The engineer opened the gate, and seeing smoke a hundred feet off in the wood, he fired in that direction."
"托普几乎立刻跳进了畜栏，他们赶紧关上门。","Almost immediately Top bounded into the corral, and the gate was quickly shut."
"“托普，托普！”工程师用手捧住狗的忠实的脑袋，叫道。","“Top, Top!” exclaimed the engineer, taking the dog’s great honest head between his hands."
"托普的脖子上系着一张纸条，上面是纳布写的几个大字，赛勒斯·哈丁念道：“‘花岗石宫’附近没有海盗。我不会乱动。可怜的赫伯特！”","A note was fastened to his neck, and Cyrus Harding read these words, traced in Neb’s large writing:—“No pirates in the neighborhood of Granite House.I will not stir.Poor Mr. Herbert!”"
"第八章","Chapter 8"
"这么说，罪犯们还在附近监视着畜栏，看来他们下决心要把移民们一个接一个地杀掉。移民们只有像对付野兽一样对付他们。但是大伙儿还要加倍小心，因为现在这帮混蛋占据了有利的一面：他们躲在暗处，而移民处在明处；他们可以突袭移民，自己却不会遭到意外的袭击。因此哈丁为在畜栏居住作了安排，畜栏里的存粮还能维持相当长的一段时间。艾尔顿的屋里各种生活必需品都有，罪犯们被移民的到来吓跑了，还没顾得上抢走屋里的东西。或许正如吉迪恩·史佩莱所想的那样，事情的所有经过是这样的：","So the convicts were still there, watching the corral, and determined to kill the settlers one after the other.There was nothing to be done but to treat them as wild beasts.But great precautions must be taken, for just now the wretches had the advantage on their side, seeing, and not being seen, being able to surprise by the suddenness of their attack, yet not to be surprised themselves.Harding made arrangements, therefore, for living in the corral, of which the provisions would last for a tolerable length of time.Ayrton’s house had been provided with all that was necessary for existence, and the convicts, scared by the arrival of the settlers, had not had time to pillage it.It was probable, as Gideon Spilett observed, that things had occurred as follows:"
"六个罪犯上了岛之后，沿着南部海岸走，他们从盘蛇半岛的海岸这边一直穿到海岸那边，不愿意冒险进入远西森林，后来到了瀑布河口。他们从那里沿着河道的右岸走，最后可能到了富兰克林山的支脉下，很自然地在那儿找到了藏身之处。他们可能没有多久就发现了畜栏，当时畜栏里没有人。在那儿，他们正式地住下了，等待时机来实施他们可怕的阴谋。艾尔顿的到来让他们吃了一惊，不过，他们最终想法子打败了那个不幸的人儿，那么，接下来的事情就不难想象了！","The six convicts, disembarking on the island, had followed the southern shore, and after having traversed the double shore of the Serpentine Peninsula, not being inclined to venture into the Far West woods, they had reached the mouth of Falls River.From this point, by following the right bank of the watercourse, they would arrive at the spurs of Mount Franklin, among which they would naturally seek a retreat, and they could not have been long in discovering the corral, then uninhabited.There they had regularly installed themselves, awaiting the moment to put their abominable schemes into execution.Ayrton’s arrival had surprised them, but they had managed to overpower the unfortunate man, and—the rest may be easily imagined!"
"现在，罪犯只剩下五个是不错，可他们一个个都是全副武装，就在森林里游荡。冒险进入森林就等于把自己暴露在敌人的袭击之下，对于他们的袭击，既无法防御，又不能阻止。","Now, the convicts,—reduced to five, it is true, but well armed,—were roaming the woods, and to venture there was to expose themselves to their attacks, which could be neither guarded against nor prevented."
"“再等等！只能这样做了！”赛勒斯·哈丁又说道。“等到赫伯特痊愈了，我们就在岛上进行一次全方位的作战，让这些罪犯们赎罪。这是我们这次大探险的目的，同时……”","“Wait!There is nothing else to be done!” repeated Cyrus Harding.“When Herbert is cured, we can organize a general battle of the island, and have satisfaction of these convicts.That will be the object of our grand expedition at the same time—”"
"“我们还要寻找那个神秘的保护者，”吉迪恩·史佩莱接着工程师的话说道，“而且，亲爱的赛勒斯，必须承认，这一次在我们最需要他的保护的时候，他却没有出手相助！”","“As the search for our mysterious protector,” added Gideon Spilett, finishing the engineer’s sentence.“An, it must be acknowledged, my dear Cyrus, that this time his protection was wanting at the very moment when it was most necessary to us!”"
"“谁知道呢？”工程师回答。","“Who knows?” replied the engineer."
"“什么意思？”通讯记者问。","“What do you mean?” asked the reporter."
"“我们还没到走投无路的时候，亲爱的史佩莱，说不定我们强大的保护者会在接下来的哪个时候对我们伸出援手呢。但是那不是眼前的问题。把赫伯特救活才最重要。”","“That we are not at the end of our trouble yet, my dear Spilett, and that his powerful intervention may have another opportunity of exercising itself.But that is not the question now.Herbert’s life before everything.”"
"这是移民们最担心的事。几天过去了，令人高兴的是那个可怜的孩子的状况没有恶化。冷水一直保持着合适的温度，因此，伤口一点儿也没发炎。通讯记者甚至似乎认为，这种含有少量硫——因为周边有火山——的水质，对伤口痊愈有一个更直接的作用。伤口化脓少了很多，在同伴们始终如一的照顾下，赫伯特活过来了，烧也退了。此外，移民们严格控制他的饮食，结果他的身体变得非常虚弱，说不定还会有什么严重的后果；但是他并不需要振奋精神的饮料，而且，绝对的休息对他来说尤其有好处。塞勒斯·哈丁、吉迪恩·史佩莱和潘克洛夫都能很熟练地为孩子包扎伤口了。屋子里所有的亚麻布料都派上了用场。赫伯特的伤口上敷着敷布和软麻布，包得不松不紧，以便伤口愈合，而且没有炎症反应。通讯记者包扎的时候格外小心，他很明白其中的重要性，一再地跟同伴们说——很多外科医生都愿意承认这一点——包扎好伤口远比成功做完一次手术难得多。","This was the colonists’ saddest thought.Several days passed, and the poor boy’s state was happily no worse.Cold water, always kept at a suitable temperature, had completely prevented the inflammation of the wounds.It even seemed to the reporter that this water, being slightly sulphurous,—which was explained by the neighborhood of the volcano, had a more direct action on the healing.The suppuration was much less abundant, and thanks to the incessant care by which he was surrounded!—Herbert returned to life, and his fever abated.He was besides subjected to a severe diet, and consequently his weakness was and would be extreme; but there was no want of refreshing drinks, and absolute rest was of the greatest benefit to him.Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, and Pencroft had become very skilful in dressing the lad’s wounds.All the linen in the house had been sacrificed.Herbert’s wounds, covered with compresses and lint, were pressed neither too much nor too little, so as to cause their cicatrization without effecting any inflammatory reaction.The reporter used extreme care in the dressing, knowing well the importance of it, and repeating to his companions that which most surgeons willingly admit, that it is perhaps rarer to see a dressing well done than an operation well performed."
"十天以后，11月22号，赫伯特的身体好多了。他开始进食一些有营养的食物。","In ten days, on the 22nd of November, Herbert was considerably better.He had begun to take some nourishment."
"他的脸上又有了血色，睁着亮晶晶的眼睛对着照顾他的同伴微笑。尽管潘克洛夫费尽力气，不停地在讲，把最稀奇古怪的故事说给他听，好不让他有机会开口，但他还是说了几句话。赫伯特向潘克洛夫问起艾尔顿，他以为艾尔顿在畜栏里，看到他不在自己身边，觉得很吃惊。不过，水手为了不让赫伯特难过，告诉他艾尔顿已经回去和纳布一起保护花岗石宫了，以使他安心。","The color was returning to his cheeks, and his bright eyes smiled at his nurses.He talked a little, notwithstanding Pencroft’s efforts, who talked incessantly to prevent him from beginning to speak, and told him the most improbable stories.Herbert had questioned him on the subject of Ayrton, whom he was astonished not to see near him, thinking that he was at the corral.But the sailor, not wishing to distress Herbert, contented himself by replying that Ayrton had rejoined Neb, so as to defend Granite House."
"“哼！”潘克洛夫说，“这帮强盗！他们不配得到一丝一毫的关心！队长原先还想善待他们，使他们改邪归正！我也会善待他们的，不过，是用子弹善待他们！”","“Humph!” said Pencroft, “these pirates! they are gentlemen who have no right to any consideration!And the captain wanted to win them by kindness!I’ll send them some kindness, but in the shape of a good bullet!”"
"“他们再没露面吗？”赫伯特问。","“And have they not been seen again?” asked Herbert."
"“没有，我的孩子，”水手回答，“不过，我们会把他们找出来的，等到你康复了，我们就看看那帮只会在背后捅刀子伤人的胆小鬼，敢不敢和我们面对面相见！”","“No, my boy,” answered the sailor, “but we shall find them, and when you are cured we shall see if the cowards who strike us from behind will dare to meet us face to face!”"
"“我的身体还很弱呢，我的潘克洛夫！”","“I am still very weak, my poor Pencroft!”"
"“没事！你的体力会慢慢恢复的！子弹穿过胸膛又怎么了？不过是一个玩笑！我看过很多这样的事了，没什么大不了的！”","“Well! your strength will return gradually!What’s a ball through the chest?Nothing but a joke!I’ve seen many, and I don’t think much of them!”"
"事情最终看起来进行得很顺利，如果不出现并发症，赫伯特肯定会康复。可是如果他的情况恶化，比方说，如果有子弹留在了他身体里，或者如果不得不对他进行截肢，那移民们该怎么办？","At last things appeared to be going on well, and if no complication occurred, Herbert’s recovery might be regarded as certain.But what would have been the condition of the colonists if his state had been aggravated,—if, for example, the ball had remained in his body, if his arm or his leg had had to be amputated?"
"“不，”史佩莱不止一次地说，“一想到这种可能性，我就忍不住发抖！”","“No,” said Spilett more than once, “I have never thought of such a contingency without shuddering!”"
"“但是，如果需要动手术的话，”哈丁有一天对他说，“你不会迟疑吧？”","“And yet, if it had been necessary to operate,” said Harding one day to him, “you would not have hesitated?”"
"“不会的，赛勒斯！”吉迪恩·史佩莱说，“不过感谢上帝，赫伯特并没有出现并发症！”","“No, Cyrus!” said Gideon Spilett, “but thank God that we have been spared this complication!”"
"在以往许多其他的推断分析中，移民们都常常依靠简单而又良好的思维，这次，多亏他们丰富的知识，他们又一次成功了！可是，会不会有那么一天，连他们的科学知识也不管用了呢？他们孤零零地在这个荒岛上。现在，每个社会阶层的人们都是相互依赖的。赛勒斯·哈丁很清楚这一点，有时他会想，会不会发生一种他们无力解决的情况？而且在他看来，他和他的同伴们直到目前都很幸运，现在却进入了一段不太走运的时期。在他们逃出里士满后的这两年半里，可以说他们是事事顺心。荒岛给他们提供了丰富的矿藏、植物和动物，而且大自然不断地施与他们东西，他们依靠科学知识将其加以利用。","As in so many other conjectures, the colonists had appealed to the logic of that simple good sense of which they had made use so often, and once more, thanks to their general knowledge, it had succeeded!But might not a time come when all their science would be at fault?They were alone on the island.Now, men in all states of society are necessary to each other.Cyrus Harding knew this well, and sometimes he asked if some circumstance might not occur which they would be powerless to surmount.It appeared to him besides, that he and his companions, till then so fortunate, had entered into an unlucky period.During the two years and a half which had elapsed since their escape from Richmond, it might be said that they had had everything their own way.The island had abundantly supplied them with minerals, vegetables, animals, and as Nature had constantly loaded them, their science had known how to take advantage of what she offered them."
"因此，移民们过得无比幸福。而且，有些时候，一股难以解释的力量还会对他们伸出援手！……可是，所有这一切都只是暂时的。","The wellbeing of the colony was therefore complete.Moreover, in certain occurrences an inexplicable influence had come to their aid!...But all that could only be for a time."
"总之，赛勒斯·哈丁相信命运开始和他们做对了。","In short, Cyrus Harding believed that fortune had turned against them."
"的确，罪犯们的船来过荒岛的沿海一带，虽然海盗可以说是被神秘地消灭掉了，但是至少还有六个家伙死里逃生了。他们上了岛，现在要抓到活着那五个是几乎不可能的事。艾尔顿一定被这些恶棍们杀害了，他们拿着武器，第一枪就险些要了赫伯特的命。这是不是移民们遭受的第一次厄运呢？哈丁常常这样问自己。通讯记者也是如此，而且，他还觉得此前不断帮他们转危为安的那股奇怪又灵验的力量，现在也不见了。是不是那个神秘的人——不管他是谁，而且他肯定在岛上呆过——离开了荒岛？他是不是也束手无策了呢？","In fact, the convicts’ ship had appeared in the waters of the island, and if the pirates had been, so to speak, miraculously destroyed, six of them, at least, had escaped the catastrophe.They had disembarked on the island, and it was almost impossible to get at the five who survived.Ayrton had no doubt been murdered by these wretches, who possessed firearms, and at the first use that they had made of them, Herbert had fallen, wounded almost mortally.Were these the first blows aimed by adverse fortune at the colonists?This was often asked by Harding.This was often repeated by the reporter; and it appeared to him also that the intervention, so strange, yet so efficacious, which till then had served them so well, had now failed them.Had this mysterious being, whatever he was, whose existence could not be denied, abandoned the island?Had he in his turn succumbed?"
"这些问题是没办法回答的。不过，不能因为哈丁和他的同伴考虑到这些问题，就以为他们绝望了。他们远远没有绝望。相反，他们直面当前的处境，分析一切机会，作好准备来应对一切情况，勇敢而坚定地迎接未来。如果厄运还要再次打击他们，就会发现他们已经准备就绪，要放手一搏了。","No reply was possible to these questions.But it must not be imagined that because Harding and his companions spoke of these things, they were men to despair.Far from that.They looked their situation in the face, they analyzed the chances, they prepared themselves for any event, they stood firm and straight before the future, and if adversity was at last to strike them, it would find in them men prepared to struggle against it."
"第九章","Chapter 9"
"受伤的孩子慢慢康复了。大伙儿现在只盼着他身体好转，可以把他送回花岗石宫。不管畜栏盖得有多好，里面的东西有多齐全，还是不如花岗石宫住着舒适、健康。况且，畜栏没有花岗石宫安全，尽管移民们很警惕，还是一直担心罪犯们会突然袭击这儿。相反，花岗石宫建在坚不可摧、难以到达的峭壁之间，他们在里面没有什么可担心的，任何袭击都注定会失败。因此，大伙儿焦急地等待着赫伯特身体恢复到一定程度，以便在不引起伤口恶化的前提下把他安全地送回去。尽管通过啄木鸟林之间的通讯还很困难，他们还是做了这个决定。","The convalescence of the young invalid was regularly progressing.One thing only was now to be desired, that his state would allow him to be brought to Granite House.However well built and supplied the corral house was, it could not be so comfortable as the healthy granite dwelling.Besides, it did not offer the same security, and its tenants, notwithstanding their watchfulness, were here always in fear of some shot from the convicts.There, on the contrary, in the middle of that impregnable and inaccessible cliff, they would have nothing to fear, and any attack on their persons would certainly fail.They therefore waited impatiently for the moment when Herbert might be moved without danger from his wound, and they were determined to make this move, although the communication through Jacamar Wood was very difficult."
"他们没有纳布的消息，不过对于这一点，大家倒是不担心。那个勇敢的黑人坚守在花岗石宫里，是不会受到袭击的。大家没有再派托普回去，因为那样不会有任何好处，只会把这只忠诚的狗暴露在敌人的枪口下，让移民丧失一个得力的助手。","They had no news from Neb, but were not uneasy on that account.The courageous Negro, well entrenched in the depths of Granite House, would not allow himself to be surprised.Top had not been sent again to him, as it appeared useless to expose the faithful dog to some shot which might deprive the settlers of their most useful auxiliary."
"于是，虽然他们急切地想回花岗石宫和纳布会合，但还是等待着。工程师看见自己的兵力分散，给了海盗们可乘之机，觉得非常苦恼。自从艾尔顿消失以后，他们就只剩四个人和敌人对抗，因为赫伯特不能算在内。勇敢的孩子非常担心这一点，他心里明白自己给大家带来了麻烦。","They waited, therefore, although they were anxious to be reunited at Granite House.It pained the engineer to see his forces divided, for it gave great advantage to the pirates.Since Ayrton’s disappearance they were only four against five, for Herbert could not yet be counted, and this was not the least care of the brave boy, who well understood the trouble of which he was the cause."
"11月29号，赛勒斯·哈丁、吉迪恩·史佩莱和潘克洛夫趁着赫伯特睡着了听不见他们说话，详细地讨论了在他们现在的情况下，应该如何对付海盗的问题。","The question of knowing how, in their condition, they were to act against the pirates, was thoroughly discussed on the 29th of November by Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, and Pencroft, at a moment when Herbert was asleep and could not hear them."
"“朋友们”，在他们谈过纳布以及无法和他通信的问题以后，通讯记者说，“我和你们的想法一样，觉得要从通往畜栏的路走回去，就等于冒着被枪击中却来不及还击的危险。不过，你们不觉得现在最好的办法是公开地去搜捕那帮混蛋？”","“My friends,” said the reporter, after they had talked of Neb and of the impossibility of communicating with him, “I think,—like you, that to venture on the road to the corral would be to risk receiving a gunshot without being able to return it.But do you not think that the best thing to be done now is to openly give chase to these wretches?”"
"“我正是这么想的，”潘克洛夫说，“我相信我们大家决不是能被子弹吓到的人，至于我，要是哈丁队长同意了，我随时都可以冲进林子里去。真是，该死，不是可以一个抵一个嘛！”","“That is just what I was thinking,” answered Pencroft.“I believe we’re not fellows to be afraid of a bullet, and as for me, if Captain Harding approves, I’m ready to dash into the forest!Why, hang it, one man is equal to another!”"
"“可你抵得了五个吗？”工程师问。","“But is he equal to five?” asked the engineer."
"“我和潘克洛夫一块儿去，”通讯记者说，“我们两个全副武装，再带上托普——”","“I will join Pencroft,” said the reporter, “and both of us, well-armed and accompanied by Top—”"
"“亲爱的史佩莱，还有你，潘克洛夫，”哈丁说，“让我们来冷静地分析一下。如果罪犯们藏在岛上的一处地方，如果我们知道那个地方，要做的只是把他们从那儿赶出去，那么我会主动出击；可是，与之相反，现在我们不是得处处担心，他们一定会先向我们开枪的吗？”","“My dear Spilett, and you, Pencroft,” answered Harding, “let us reason coolly.If the convicts were hid in one spot of the island, if we knew that spot, and had only to dislodge them, I would undertake a direct attack; but is there not occasion to fear, on the contrary, that they are sure to fire the first shot?”"
"“好了，队长，”潘克洛夫大声说，“子弹也不一定总能打中目标啊。”","“Well, captain,” cried Pencroft, “a bullet does not always reach its mark.”"
"“赫伯特就被打中了，潘克洛夫，”工程师回答，“况且，如果你们都离开畜栏，那这里就只剩我一个人防守了。你们认为罪犯们看不见你们离开畜栏吗？难道他们不会先放你们进入森林，再趁着这里只剩下我和一个受伤的孩子袭击畜栏吗？”","“That which struck Herbert did not miss, Pencroft,” replied the engineer.“Besides, observe that if both of you left the corral I should remain here alone to defend it.Do you imagine that the convicts will not see you leave it, that they will not allow you to enter the forest, and that they will not attack it during your absence, knowing that there is no one here but a wounded boy and a man?”"
"“你说得对，队长，”潘克洛夫满腔气愤地说，“你说得对，他们知道畜栏里什么都有，为了再次霸占畜栏会无所不为的；你一个人肯定敌不过他们。”","“You are right, captain,” replied Pencroft, his chest swelling with sullen anger.“You are right; they will do all they can to retake the corral, which they know to be well stored; and alone you could not hold it against them.”"
"“唉，要是我们在‘花岗石宫’就好了！”","“Oh, if we were only at Granite House!”"
"“要是我们在‘花岗石宫’的话，”工程师说，“情形就不一样了。在那儿，我就不用担心把赫伯特留给一个人照顾，而让另外三个人去荒岛上的森林里搜寻了。可是现在我们是在畜栏，最好还是呆在这儿，直到我们大伙儿能一块儿离开的时候再说。”","“If we were at Granite House,” answered the engineer, “the case would be very different.There I should not be afraid to leave Herbert with one, while the other three went to search the forests of the island.But we are at the corral, and it is best to stay here until we can leave it together.”"
"赛勒斯·哈丁的分析无可辩驳，他的同伴们非常明白这一点。","Cyrus Harding’s reasoning was unanswerable, and his companions understood it well."
"“要是艾尔顿还在的话多好！”吉迪恩·史佩莱说，“可怜的家伙！他回到集体中间生活不过是这么短的一段时间。”","“If only Ayrton was still one of us!” said Gideon Spilett.“Poor fellow! his return to social life will have been but of short duration.”"
"“谁说他一定死了。”潘克洛夫用一种古怪的腔调补充了一句。","“If he is dead,” added Pencroft, in a peculiar tone."
"“那么，潘克洛夫，你是希望那帮恶棍没有把他杀了？”吉迪恩·史佩莱说。","“Do you hope, then, Pencroft, that the villains have spared him?” asked Gideon Spilett."
"“如果对他们有利，他们不会杀死他的。”","“Yes, if they had any interest in doing so.”"
"“什么！你认为艾尔顿一看见过去的同伴，就忘记了我们对他所做的一切……”","“What! you suppose that Ayrton finding his old companions, forgetting all that he owes us—”"
"“谁知道是不是呢？”水手也觉得自己的这个假设可耻，吞吞吐吐地说不出口。","“Who knows?” answered the sailor, who did not hazard this shameful supposition without hesitating."
"“潘克洛夫，”哈丁拉住水手的胳膊说，“那是你的一个坏念头，如果你坚持这样说，我会很难过的。我敢为艾尔顿的忠诚打包票。”","“Pencroft,” said Harding, taking the sailor’s arm, “that is a wicked idea of yours, and you will distress me much if you persist in speaking thus.I will answer for Ayrton’s fidelity.”"
"“我也敢。”通讯记者很快跟着说。","“And I also,” added the reporter quickly."
"“好吧，好吧，队长，我错了，”潘克洛夫说，“这确实是我的一个坏念头，什么根据都没有。可是我能怎么做呀？我现在晕头转向的。困在畜栏这儿快把我烦死了，我从没像现在这样心烦意乱过。”","“Yes, yes, captain, I was wrong,” replied Pencroft; “it was a wicked idea indeed that I had, and nothing justifies it.But what can I do?I’m not in my senses.This imprisonment in the corral wearies me horribly, and I have never felt so excited as I do now."
"“耐心一点，潘克洛夫。”工程师说，“亲爱的史佩莱，你觉得还要再过多久才能把赫伯特送回‘花岗石宫’去呢？”","“Be patient, Pencroft,” replied the engineer.“How long will it be, my dear Spilett, before you think Herbert may be carried to Granite House?”"
"“那个很难说，赛勒斯，”通讯记者回答，“因为稍一大意，就可能造成严重后果。不过他在慢慢好起来，如果他的体力继续恢复的话，那么从现在算起，再过八天——好了，我们再等等看吧。”","“That is difficult to say, Cyrus,” answered the reporter, “for any imprudence might involve terrible consequences.But his convalescence is progressing, and if he continues to gain strength, in eight days from now—well, we shall see.”"
"八天！移民们回花岗石宫的日子会因此推迟到12月初。现在春天已经过去两个月了。天气很好，气温也升得很高了。岛上森林里的树木长得枝繁叶茂，马上就到了收获农作物的季节了。因此，等到他们回到眺望岗的高地，除了按照计划对全岛进行一次探险以外，剩下的就是干繁重的农活了。","Eight days!That would put off the return to Granite House until the first days of December.At this time two months of spring had already passed.The weather was fine, and the heat began to be great.The forests of the island were in full leaf, and the time was approaching when the usual crops ought to be gathered.The return to the plateau of Prospect Heights would, therefore, be followed by extensive agricultural labors, interrupted only by the projected expedition through the island."
"因此，完全可以看出来，对移民们来说，这样困在畜栏里对他们损失非常大。","It can, therefore, be well understood how injurious this seclusion in the corral must have been to the colonists."
"他们现在不得不在现实的需要面前低头，然而他们的内心非常焦急。","But if they were compelled to bow before necessity, they did not do so without impatience."
"有一两次，通讯记者冒险到路上去，巡视一下栅栏周围。托普跟着他，吉迪恩·史佩莱扣着扳机，一有紧急情况就随时开枪。","Once or twice the reporter ventured out into the road and made the tour of the palisade.Top accompanied him, and Gideon Spilett, his gun cocked, was ready for any emergency."
"他没有遭遇什么意外，也没有发现任何可疑的迹象。如果有一点危险，他的狗也会警告他。既然托普没有叫，就可以因此下结论，至少此刻没有什么值得害怕的，罪犯们可能藏在岛上别的什么地方。","He met with no misadventure and found no suspicious traces.His dog would have warned him of any danger, and, as Top did not bark, it might be concluded that there was nothing to fear at the moment at least, and that the convicts were occupied in another part of the island."
"然而，11月27号，吉迪恩·史佩莱第二次巡察时，他向着山的南部，冒险往林子里走了四分之一英里，这时他觉得托普闻到什么了。托普不再是一副漫不经心的样子，他跑前跑后，在野草和灌木丛中间来回穿梭，好像闻到了什么可疑的目标。","However, on his second sortie, on the 27th of November, Gideon Spilett, who had ventured a quarter of a mile into the woods, towards the south of the mountain, remarked that Top scented something.The dog had no longer his unconcerned manner; he went backwards and forwards, ferreting among the grass and bushes as if his smell had revealed some suspicious object to him."
"吉迪恩·史佩莱一边跟着它，鼓励它，用自己的声音使它兴奋，一边高度警惕着四周，藏在一棵树后，准备随时开枪。托普不可能闻到了人的气味，不然，他早就阴沉沉地低声怒吼了。现在它没有发出吼叫声，可见附近并没有危险，也没有危险即将到来的迹象。","Gideon Spilett followed Top, encouraged him, excited him by his voice, while keeping a sharp look-out, his gun ready to fire, and sheltering himself behind the trees.It was not probable that Top scented the presence of man, for in that case, he would have announced it by half-uttered, sullen, angry barks.Now, as he did not growl, it was because danger was neither near nor approaching."
"这样将近过了五分钟，托普还在四处翻找着，通讯记者小心地跟在后面，突然，托普向一处长势茂盛的灌木丛冲去，从里面叼出一块破布。","Nearly five minutes passed thus, Top rummaging, the reporter following him prudently when, all at once, the dog rushed towards a thick bush, and drew out a rag."
"这块布上面沾着污迹，破破烂烂的，史佩莱立即把它带回畜栏。移民们仔细地检查了破布，发现这是从艾尔顿的马甲上撕下来的一块毛毡，是花岗石宫工厂生产出来的独一无二的产品。","It was a piece of cloth, stained and torn, which Spilett immediately brought back to the corral.There it was examined by the colonists, who found that it was a fragment of Ayrton’s waistcoat, a piece of that felt, manufactured solely by the Granite House factory."
"“你看，潘克洛夫，”哈丁说，“可怜的艾尔顿反抗过。罪犯们硬把他拖走了！现在你还怀疑他的忠诚吗？”","“You see, Pencroft,” observed Harding, “there has been resistance on the part of the unfortunate Ayrton.The convicts have dragged him away in spite of himself!Do you still doubt his honesty?”"
"“不，队长，”水手回答，“我早就为我对他的怀疑感到懊悔了！不过，我觉得从这件事中，可以知道点什么。”","“No, captain,” answered the sailor, “and I repented of my suspicion a long time ago!But it seems to me that something may be learned from the incident.”"
"“什么？”通讯记者问。","“What is that?” asked the reporter."
"“艾尔顿并没有在畜栏里被杀害！既然他反抗过，那么罪犯们拽着他走的途中，他都一直没有死！因此，或许，他现在还活着！”","“It is that Ayrton was not killed at the corral!That they dragged him away living, since he has resisted.Therefore, perhaps, he is still living!”"
"“的确，这有可能。”一直沉思的工程师说。","“Perhaps, indeed,” replied the engineer, who remained thoughtful."
"艾尔顿的同伴们现在可以抱着这个希望了。确实，他们之前都相信，艾尔顿在畜栏里遭到突袭后，像赫伯特那样被一枪打倒了。但是如果罪犯们一开始没有杀他，如果他们把他活着带到到岛上其他的什么地方，那么是不是可以认为他现在还是他们的俘虏呢？甚至，或许罪犯当中有一个认出了艾尔顿是逃犯头目，澳洲人本·乔伊斯的昔日同伙。谁知道他们会不会妄想让艾尔顿再回到他们当中去呢？如果能让他叛变，他将对他们很有用处的。","This was a hope, to which Ayrton’s companions could still hold.Indeed, they had before believed that, surprised in the corral, Ayrton had fallen by a bullet, as Herbert had fallen.But if the convicts had not killed him at first, if they had brought him living to another part of the island, might it not be admitted that he was still their prisoner?Perhaps, even, one of them had found in Ayrton his old Australian companion Ben Joyce, the chief of the escaped convicts.And who knows but that they had conceived the impossible hope of bringing back Ayrton to themselves?He would have been very useful to them, if they had been able to make him turn traitor!"
"畜栏里的移民觉得这件事对他们是有利，找到艾尔顿看起来也不再是件不可能的事了。在艾尔顿这方面来说，如果他只是一个俘虏，那他一定会竭尽所能从那帮混蛋的魔爪里逃出来，到那时，移民就多了一个强大的帮手！","This incident was, therefore, favorably interpreted at the corral, and it no longer appeared impossible that they should find Ayrton again.On his side, if he was only a prisoner, Ayrton would no doubt do all he could to escape from the hands of the villains, and this would be a powerful aid to the settlers!"
"“不管怎样，”吉迪恩·史佩莱说，“要是艾尔顿能侥幸逃出来，他会直接回‘花岗石宫’去，因为他还不知道罪犯们实施的这次让赫伯特受伤的谋杀行动，因此也决不会想到我们会被困在畜栏里。”","“At any rate,” observed Gideon Spilett, “if happily Ayrton did manage to escape, he would go directly to Granite House, for he could not know of the attempted assassination of which Herbert has been a victim, and consequently would never think of our being imprisoned in the corral.”"
"“嗯。但愿他在那儿，就在‘花岗石宫’里！”潘克洛夫大声说，“但愿我们也在那儿！因为，就算那帮混蛋对我们的屋子做不了什么，可他们能把我们的高地、农场和家禽场洗劫一空呀！”","“Oh!I wish that he was there, at Granite House!” cried Pencroft, “and that we were there, too!For, although the rascals can do nothing to our house, they may plunder the plateau, our plantations, our poultry-yard!”"
"潘克洛夫已经变成了一个彻头彻尾的庄稼汉，满心系着自己的庄稼。但是，必须说赫伯特比任何人都急切地想回花岗石宫，因为他知道那儿有多么地需要移民。是他把大家困在畜栏里！因此，他满脑子全想着一件事——离开畜栏，什么时候离开？他相信自己经得起从这儿到花岗石宫的旅途颠簸。他深信在自己那间能够看到大海，闻到海的气息的房间里，他的体力会恢复得更快的！","Pencroft had become a thorough farmer, heartily attached to his crops.But it must be said that Herbert was more anxious than any to return to Granite House, for he knew how much the presence of the settlers was needed there.And it was he who was keeping them at the corral!Therefore, one idea occupied his mind—to leave the corral, and when!He believed he could bear removal to Granite House.He was sure his strength would return more quickly in his room, with the air and sight of the sea!"
"他催了吉迪恩·史佩莱好几次，然而史佩莱始终没有决定动身，他的理由很充分，因为赫伯特的伤口才刚刚好了一半，怕在途中再次裂开。","Several times he pressed Gideon Spilett, but the latter, fearing, with good reason, that Herbert’s wounds, half healed, might reopen on the way, did not give the order to start."
"然而，赛勒斯·哈丁和他的两个同伴最终因为发生的一件事情听从了孩子的意愿，只有上帝知道这个决定可能带给他们伤心与懊悔。","However, something occurred which compelled Cyrus Harding and his two friends to yield to the lad’s wish, and God alone knew that this determination might cause them grief and remorse."
"那是11月29号，晚上七点钟。三个移民正在赫伯特的房间里交谈，这时，他们听见了赫伯特急促的叫声。","It was the 29th of November, seven o’clock in the evening.The three settlers were talking in Herbert’s room, when they heard Top utter quick barks."
"哈丁、潘克洛夫和史佩莱抓起他们的枪就往屋外面跑。托普在栅栏底下又蹦又叫，不过它看起来是因为高兴，而不是生气。","Harding, Pencroft, and Spilett seized their guns and ran out of the house.Top, at the foot of the palisade, was jumping, barking, but it was with pleasure, not anger."
"“有人来了！”","“Some one is coming.”"
"“嗯。”","“Yes.”"
"“不是敌人！”","“It is not an enemy!”"
"“或许是纳布？”","“Neb, perhaps?”"
"“是不是艾尔顿呢？”","“Or Ayrton?”"
"还没等工程师和同伴们把话说完，一个身体就越过栅栏，落进了畜栏里。","These words had hardly been exchanged between the engineer and his two companions when a body leaped over the palisade and fell on the ground inside the corral."
"原来是贾普，贾普亲自来了，托普立即向它表示最热情的欢迎。","It was Jup, Master Jup in person, to whom Top immediately gave a most cordial reception."
"“贾普！”潘克洛夫叫道。","“Jup!” exclaimed Pencroft."
"“是纳布派它来找我们的。”通讯记者说。","“Neb has sent him to us,” said the reporter."
"“那么，”工程师接着说，“它身上一定带着什么纸条。”","“Then,” replied the engineer, “he must have some note on him.”"
"潘克洛夫赶紧跑到猩猩身边。当然，如果纳布要告诉主人什么重要的事情，没有比贾普更快速、更让人放心的信使了，移民们，甚至托普都没法经过的地方，它都能走过去。","Pencroft rushed up to the orang.Certainly if Neb had any important matter to communicate to his master he could not employ a more sure or more rapid messenger, who could pass where neither the colonists could, nor even Top himself."
"赛勒斯·哈丁说得没错。贾普的脖子上绑着一个小袋子，里面装着纳布写的一张小纸条。","Cyrus Harding was not mistaken.At Jup’s neck hung a small bag, and in this bag was found a little note traced by Neb’s hand."
"当哈丁和同伴们看到下面这些话后，可想而知，他们有多绝望：","The despair of Harding and his companions may be imagined when they read these words:—"
"“星期五，早上六点钟。","“Friday, six o’clock in the morning."
"“高地遭到罪犯侵略。","“Plateau invaded by convicts."
"纳布。”","“Neb.”"
"大家你看看我，我看看你，一句话也没说，然后又进了屋子。他们该怎么做呢？罪犯们在眺望岗！那意味着灾难、劫掠、毁灭！","They gazed at each other without uttering a word, then they re-entered the house. what were they to do?The convicts on Prospect Heights! that was disaster, devastation, ruin."
"赫伯特一看见工程师、通讯记者和潘克洛夫又进来了，就猜到他们的处境可能变坏了，当看到贾普时，他确信花岗石宫遭遇了什么不幸的威胁。","Herbert, on seeing the engineer, the reporter, and Pencroft re-enter, guessed that their situation was aggravated, and when he saw Jup, he no longer doubted that some misfortune menaced Granite House."
"“哈丁队长，”他说，“我必须要离开；我经得起路上的颠簸劳累。我必须要离开。”","“Captain Harding,” said he, “I must go; I can bear the journey.I must go.”"
"吉迪恩·史佩莱走到赫伯特身边，看了看他，然后说道：","Gideon Spilett approached Herbert; then, having looked at him,—"
"“那么我们现在就动身！”","“Let us go, then!” said he."
"至于说把赫伯特放在担架上抬着还是放进艾尔顿驾来的马车里，大家很快作出了决定。把受伤的孩子放在担架上抬着可能对他来说更轻松一些，不过那样得要要两个人抬担架，如果移民们在路上遭遇袭击的话，就又少了两支枪来防卫。相反，他们为什么不用大车，从而把所有人手都腾出来呢？他们可以把赫伯特现在铺的垫子铺在车里，小心翼翼地前进，这样大车不是就不会颠簸了吗？这是可以办到的。","The question was quickly decided whether Herbert should be carried on a litter or in the cart which had brought Ayrton to the corral.The motion of the litter would have been more easy for the wounded lad, but it would have necessitated two bearers, that is to say, there would have been two guns less for defense if an attack was made on the road.Would they not, on the contrary, by employing the cart leave every arm free?Was it impossible to place the mattress on which Herbert was lying in it, and to advance with so much care that any jolt should be avoided?It could be done."
"大车拉过来了。潘克洛夫给野驴套上挽具。赛勒斯·哈丁和通讯记者把赫伯特连同垫子一块儿抬起来，放在大车最里面。天气很好。明媚的太阳光从树丛中斑驳射过。","The cart was brought.Pencroft harnessed the onager.Cyrus Harding and the reporter raised Herbert’s mattress and placed it on the bottom of the cart.The weather was fine.The sun’s bright rays glanced through the trees."
"“拿好枪了吗？”赛勒斯·哈丁问。","“Are the guns ready?” asked Cyrus Harding."
"每个人都准备好了。工程师和潘克洛夫各自带着一支双管枪，吉迪恩·史佩莱扛着他的步枪，大家都只等着出发了。","They were.The engineer and Pencroft, each armed with a double-barreled gun, and Gideon Spilett carrying his rifle, had nothing to do but start."
"“你舒服吗，赫伯特？”工程师问。","“Are you comfortable, Herbert?” asked the engineer."
"“啊，队长，”孩子回答，“放心吧，我不会死在路上的！”","“Ah, captain,” replied the lad, “don’t be uneasy, I shall not die on the road!”"
"看得出来，可怜的孩子一面这样说，一面聚集起所有的力量，靠着坚强的意志力，让他虚弱的身体振作起来。","While speaking thus, it could be seen that the poor boy had called up all his energy, and by the energy of a powerful will had collected his failing strength."
"工程师感到心里一阵难受。他还犹豫着要不要下令出发；然而那样会把赫伯特推向绝望——也许会杀了他。","The engineer felt his heart sink painfully.He still hesitated to give the signal for departure; but that would have driven Herbert to despair—killed him perhaps."
"“走吧！”哈丁说。","“Forward!” said Harding."
"畜栏的门打开了。贾普和托普懂得什么时候该保持沉默，他们跑在前面。大车出来后，门关上了，潘克洛夫牵着驴，慢慢地往前走去。","The gate of the corral was opened.Jup and Top, who knew when to be silent, ran in advance.The cart came out, the gate was reclosed, and the onager, led by Pencroft, advanced at a slow pace."
"如果大家不选择从畜栏直接通往花岗石宫的这条小路，而是走另外一条路，当然会安全一些，不过，驴车却会碰上更大的困难，不得不从树底下穿过去。因此，尽管罪犯们对这条路了如指掌，大家还是得沿着原路前进。","Certainly, it would have been safer to have taken a different road than that which led straight from the corral to Granite House, but the cart would have met with great difficulties in moving under the trees.It was necessary, therefore, to follow this way, although it was well known to the convicts."
"赛勒斯·哈丁和吉迪恩·史佩莱一人走在车的一边，准备一遇到袭击，就随时反击。然而，罪犯们不可能已经离开了眺望岗高地。","Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett walked one on each side of the cart, ready to answer to any attack.However, it was not probable that the convicts would have yet left the plateau of Prospect Heights."
"很明显，罪犯们一在那儿出现，纳布就写好纸条送过来了。纸条上写的时间是早上六点钟。机灵的猩猩习惯了经常来畜栏，几乎不出四十五分钟，就能从五英里以外的花岗石宫赶过来。因此，他们在路上不会遇到什么危险，如果要开枪，大概也是到了花岗石宫附近的时候。然而，移民们都保持着高度警惕。贾普拿着棍子，和托普时而走在前面，时而钻进路旁的林子里探索，没有发出什么表示危险的信号。","Neb’s note had evidently been written and sent as soon as the convicts had shown themselves there.Now, this note was dated six o’clock in the morning, and the active orang, accustomed to come frequently to the corral, had taken scarcely three quarters of an hour to cross the five miles which separated it from Granite House.They would, therefore, be safe at that time, and if there was any occasion for firing, it would probably not be until they were in the neighborhood of Granite House.However, the colonists kept a strict watch.Top and Jup, the latter armed with his club, sometimes in front, sometimes beating the wood at the sides of the road, signalized no danger."
"潘克洛夫驾着马车缓慢地前进着。他们是七点半离开畜栏的。一个钟头后，他们已经走了四英里，路上没有发生任何事故。路上静悄悄的，跟慈悲河和格兰特湖之间的那整片啄木鸟森林没什么两样。没有什么值得警惕的。森林还像移民们刚到荒岛上那天一样死寂。","The cart advanced slowly under Pencroft’s guidance.It had left the corral at half-past seven.An hour after, four out of the five miles had been cleared, without any incident having occurred.The road was as deserted as all that part of the Jacamar Wood which lay between the Mercy and the lake.There was no occasion for any warning.The wood appeared as deserted as on the day when the colonists first landed on the island."
"他们就快到高地了。再走一英里，就能看见甘油河上的吊桥了。赛勒斯·哈丁猜测吊桥还在原来的地方；假使罪犯们过了桥，渡过包围高地的小溪，他们会采取预防措施，再把吊桥放下来，以便留条后路。","They approached the plateau.Another mile and they would see the bridge over Creek Glycerine.Cyrus Harding expected to find it in its place; supposing that the convicts would have crossed it, and that, after having passed one of the streams which enclosed the plateau, they would have taken the precaution to lower it again, so as to keep open a retreat."
"终于，从树木间的一个空隙可以看见海平面了。但驴车继续前进着，护送它的人谁也不想把它抛弃。","At length an opening in the trees allowed the sea-horizon to be seen.But the cart continued its progress, for not one of its defenders thought of abandoning it."
"这时潘克洛夫突然勒住了野驴，用粗哑的嗓音叫道：","At that moment Pencroft stopped the onager, and in a hoarse voice,—"
"“啊！这帮混蛋！”","“Oh! the villains!” he exclaimed."
"他指着从磨坊、棚屋和家禽场的屋舍升起的一团浓烟。","And he pointed to a thick smoke rising from the mill, the sheds, and the buildings at the poultry-yard."
"一个人在烟雾中慢慢移动着。那是纳布。","A man was moving about in the midst of the smoke.It was Neb."
"他的同伴们喊了一声。他听见了，朝大家跑过来。","His companions uttered a shout.He heard, and ran to meet them."
"罪犯们破坏了高地，差不多半小时前已经离开了。","The convicts had left the plateau nearly half-an-hour before, having devastated it!"
"“赫伯特呢？”纳布问。","“And Mr. Herbert?” asked Neb."
"吉迪恩·史佩莱回到马车旁边来。","Gideon Spilett returned to the cart."
"赫伯特已经昏迷了过去。","Herbert had lost consciousness!"
"第十章","Chapter 10"
"殖民者们不再考虑那些罪犯给“花岗岩宫”带来的威胁以及高地上覆盖的废墟。赫伯特危在旦夕，他的状况比其他的事情都重要。这次移动他会不会引发什么致命的内伤呢？通讯记者不敢妄下结论，但是他和他的同伴们对结果几乎已经不抱什么希望了。小车到了河道拐弯的地方。他们用树枝做成了一副担架，然后把不省人事的赫伯特连同垫子一起放在了上面。十分钟以后，赛勒斯·哈丁、史佩莱和潘克洛夫来到了悬崖脚下，留下纳布一个人把车推到眺望岗的高地上去。升降机开始上升，不久赫伯特就躺在了花岗石宫里他自己的床上了。","Of the convicts, the dangers which menaced Granite House, the ruins with which the plateau was covered, the colonists thought no longer.Herbert’s critical state outweighed all other considerations.Would the removal prove fatal to him by causing some internal injury?The reporter could not affirm it, but he and his companions almost despaired of the result.The cart was brought to the bend of the river.There some branches, disposed as a liner, received the mattress on which lay the unconscious Herbert.Ten minutes after, Cyrus Harding, Spilett, and Pencroft were at the foot of the cliff, leaving Neb to take the cart on to the plateau of Prospect Heights.The lift was put in motion, and Herbert was soon stretched on his bed in Granite House."
"他们花了多少工夫才使他苏醒过来！他醒来时发现躺在自己的房间里不禁露出了笑容，但是因为太过虚弱，他想低声说句话都力不从心。吉迪恩·史佩莱检查了他原本就没有完全愈合的伤口。他怕它们再度破裂。所幸他的担心是多余的。由此看来，他怎么会出现虚脱的现象呢？赫伯特的病情怎么会恶化到这种地步呢？这时，少年由于高烧而昏睡了过去，通讯记者和潘克洛夫一直守在他的床边。这期间，哈丁把畜栏里发生的事情原原本本地告诉了纳布，纳布也向他的主人讲述了高地上出现的状况。","What cares were lavished on him to bring him back to life!He smiled for a moment on finding himself in his room, but could scarcely even murmur a few words, so great was his weakness.Gideon Spilett examined his wounds.He feared to find them reopened, having been imperfectly healed.There was nothing of the sort.From whence, then, came this prostration? why was Herbert so much worse?The lad then fell into a kind of feverish sleep, and the reporter and Pencroft remained near the bed.During this time, Harding told Neb all that had happened at the corral, and Neb recounted to his master the events of which the plateau had just been the theater."
"那些罪犯只在前一天夜里在森林边上的甘油河附近出现过。当时纳布正在家禽场附近监视，他发现其中的一个海盗正打算渡河，便毫不犹豫地朝他开了一枪。可是，因为周围太黑了，他也不知道有没有打中那个人。无论如何，这一枪是不足以把这伙罪犯吓跑的，纳布刚好来得及爬到花岗石宫里面去，至少在那里他是安全的。","It was only during the preceding night that the convicts had appeared on the edge of the forest, at the approaches to Creek Glycerine.Neb, who was watching near the poultry-yard, had not hesitated to fire at one of the pirates, who was about to cross the stream; but in the darkness he could not tell whether the man had been hit or not.At any rate, it was not enough to frighten away the band, and Neb had only just time to get up to Granite House, where at least he was in safety."
"可是，到了那儿，他又能干什么呢？眼瞅着那些罪犯就要破坏高地了，怎么才能阻止他们呢？纳布有没有什么法子通知他的主人呢？另外，畜栏里的人当时处在什么样的状况下呢？赛勒斯·哈丁和他的同伴们在11月11号动身，现在已经是29号了。也就是说，自从纳布得到唯一一条由托普送来的消息到现在，已经19天了。那条坏消息告诉他：艾尔顿失踪了，赫伯特身负重伤，工程师、通讯记者和水手都被困在了畜栏里！","But what was he to do there?How prevent the devastations with which the convicts threatened the plateau?Had Neb any means by which to warn his master?And, besides, in what situation were the inhabitants of the corral themselves?Cyrus Harding and his companions had left on the 11th of November, and it was now the 29th.It was, therefore, nineteen days since Neb had had other news than that brought by Top—disastrous news: Ayrton disappeared, Herbert severely wounded, the engineer, reporter, and sailor, as it were, imprisoned in the corral!"
"该怎么办呢？可怜的纳布不禁问自己。他并不为自己担心，因为那些罪犯是没法到花岗石宫上来的。可是他们搭建的屋子、种植的作物和所有的布置都要任凭海盗们糟蹋了！要是能让赛勒斯·哈丁来决定应该做什么就好了，至少让他知道可能遇到的危险也好啊。","What was he to do? asked poor Neb.Personally he had nothing to fear, for the convicts could not reach him in Granite House.But the buildings, the plantations, all their arrangements at the mercy of the pirates!Would it not be best to let Cyrus Harding judge of what he ought to do, and to warn him, at least, of the danger which threatened him?"
"纳布想到可以利用贾普，于是就写了一张字条让它带着。他知道猩猩非常聪明，这一点已经被证实过很多次了。因为他们经常在它面前说起“畜栏”，因此贾普知道这个词的意思，此外，它经常陪着潘克洛夫驾着小车到畜栏去，这一点大家或许还记得。天还没亮。机灵的猩猩会知道如何偷偷地穿过树林的。再者说，就算被罪犯发现了，他们肯定会把它当做一只普通的猩猩罢了。","Neb then thought of employing Jup, and confiding a note to him.He knew the orang’s great intelligence, which had been often put to the proof.Jup understood the word corral, which had been frequently pronounced before him, and it may be remembered, too, that he had often driven the cart thither in company with Pencroft.Day had not yet dawned.The active orang would know how to pass unperceived through the woods, of which the convicts, besides, would think he was a native."
"纳布没有犹豫。他写好了字条，把它系在了贾普的脖子上，然后把猩猩带到了花岗石宫的门口，从那儿引出了一根长绳子一直搭到了地面上；然后，他将这几个字重复了好几遍：","Neb did not hesitate.He wrote the note, he tied it to Jup’s neck, he brought the ape to the door of Granite House, from which he let down a long cord to the ground; then, several times he repeated these words,—"
"“贾普，贾普！畜栏，畜栏！”","“Jup Jup! corral, corral!”"
"猩猩明白了他的意思，抓住绳子，敏捷地滑到了沙滩上，随即消失在黑暗中，没有引起罪犯们的丝毫注意。","The creature understood, seized the cord, glided rapidly down the beach, and disappeared in the darkness without the convicts’ attention having been in the least excited."
"“你做得很好，纳布，”哈丁说，“但是如果不通知我们，你可能会做得更好！”","“You did well, Neb,” said Harding, “but perhaps in not warning us you would have done still better!”"
"赛勒斯·哈丁之所以这么说是因为他想到了赫伯特，这次迁移严重地影响了他的复原。","And, in speaking thus, Cyrus Harding thought of Herbert, whose recovery the removal had so seriously checked."
"纳布讲完了。那些罪犯没有在沙滩上出现过。他们摸不清岛上住了多少人，也许他们还以为有一大群人驻守在花岗石宫呢。他们肯定记得，在双桅船发起进攻时，无论是从高处的山石，还是低处的山石，都有很多的枪弹向他们射过来，他们毫无疑问不想暴露他们自己。但眺望岗的高地却是大敞四开的，没有花岗石宫的炮火做掩护。于是，他们爬了上去，肆无忌惮地破坏起来，抢劫、放火、捣毁一切，直到移民们回来之前半小时才离开了那里，当时他们还以为移民们还被困在畜栏里呢。","Neb ended his account.The convicts had not appeared at all on the beach.Not knowing the number of the island’s inhabitants, they might suppose that Granite House was defended by a large party.They must have remembered that during the attack by the brig numerous shot had been fired both from the lower and upper rocks, and no doubt they did not wish to expose themselves.But the plateau of Prospect Heights was open to them, and not covered by the fire of Granite House.They gave themselves up, therefore, to their instinct of destruction,—plundering, burning, devastating everything,—and only retiring half an hour before the arrival of the colonists, whom they believed still confined in the corral."
"他们走了之后，纳布急忙跑了出来。他冒着暴露自己甚至中弹的危险，爬上高地，试图扑灭笼罩在家禽场的建筑物上的火焰，虽然没有起到什么作用，但他还是坚持和大火抗争，直到马车出现在森林的边缘处时才停了下来。","On their retreat, Neb hurried out.He climbed the plateau at the risk of being perceived and fired at, tried to extinguish the fire which was consuming the buildings of the poultry-yard, and had struggled, though in vain, against it until the cart appeared at the edge of the wood."
"这就是事情前前后后的经过。对于林肯岛上的移民来说，这些罪犯们的存在永远都是一个危险的隐患。一直以来他们都生活在快乐中，可是从现在开始，他们却可能还会遭受更大的不幸。","Such had been these serious events.The presence of the convicts constituted a permanent source of danger to the settlers in Lincoln Island, until then so happy, and who might now expect still greater misfortunes."
"史佩莱和赫伯特、潘克洛夫留在花岗石宫里，赛勒斯·哈丁在纳布的陪同之下，要亲自去查看一下这次受灾的程度。","Spilett remained in Granite House with Herbert and Pencroft, while Cyrus Harding, accompanied by Neb, proceeded to judge for himself of the extent of the disaster."
"好在罪犯们没有到花岗石宫的脚下来。要不然“石窟”处的工场恐怕就会难逃一劫了。可是即便“石窟”遭到破坏，所受的损失和眺望岗比起来，还是比较容易弥补的。哈丁和纳布朝着慈悲河走去，爬上河的左岸，没有发现罪犯们的任何踪迹，在河的对岸和森林的深处也没有找到任何可疑的迹象。","It was fortunate that the convicts had not advanced to the foot of Granite House.The workshop at the Chimneys would in that case not have escaped destruction.But after all, this evil would have been more easily reparable than the ruins accumulated on the plateau of Prospect Heights.Harding and Neb proceeded towards the Mercy, and ascended its left bank without meeting with any trace of the convicts; nor on the other side of the river, in the depths of the wood, could they perceive any suspicious indications."
"如此看来，他们大致有了两种推断，一种是在花岗石宫的移民们走在从畜栏回来的路上时，被罪犯们发现了；另一种推断是在罪犯们破坏了高地之后，他们就沿着慈悲河，进入啄木鸟林深处，因此没有注意到移民们回来了。","Besides, it might be supposed that in all probability either the convicts knew of the return of the settlers to Granite House, by having seen them pass on the road from the corral, or, after the devastation of the plateau, they had penetrated into Jacamar Wood, following the course of the Mercy, and were thus ignorant of their return."
"如果第一种推断成立，那么他们肯定又回到畜栏那边去了，因为现在那儿没有人防守，却有很多宝贵的东西。","In the former case, they must have returned towards the corral, now without defenders, and which contained valuable stores."
"如果第二种推断是真的，那么他们肯定回到了他们安身的地方，在那儿伺机再次发动进攻。","In the latter, they must have regained their encampment, and would wait on opportunity to recommence the attack."
"因此，要防范他们并不是不可能的。但是任何进一步肃清岛上罪犯的计划现在都因为赫伯特的病情变得很困难。的确，以他们的全部力量，勉强能应付这伙罪犯，可是眼下谁也不能离开花岗石宫。","It was, therefore, possible to prevent them, but any enterprise to clear the island was now rendered difficult by reason of Herbert’s condition.Indeed, their whole force would have been barely sufficient to cope with the convicts, and just now no one could leave Granite House."
"工程师和纳布到了高地。到处都是一片荒凉的景象。田地都被践踏了，眼看即将颗粒饱满的麦穗倒在地上。其他的作物也遭到了同样的破坏。","The engineer and Neb arrived on the plateau.Desolation reigned everywhere.The fields had been trampled over; the ears of wheat, which were nearly full-grown, lay on the ground.The other plantations had not suffered less."
"菜园也被破坏了。所幸他们可以依靠花岗石宫里保存的一些种子弥补这次的损失。","The kitchen-garden was destroyed.Happily, Granite House possessed a store of seed which would enable them to repair these misfortunes."
"大火烧毁了家禽场的围墙和建筑物以及驴棚。一些受惊的动物在高地上走来走去。着火时躲在湖面上的飞禽已经回到了它们已经习惯了的地方，在河岸边戏水。一切都需要重新建设。","As to the wall and buildings of the poultry-yard and the onagers stable, the fire had destroyed all.A few terrified creatures roamed over the plateau.The birds, which during the fire had taken refuge on the waters of the lake, had already returned to their accustomed spot, and were dabbling on the banks.Everything would have to be reconstructed."
"赛勒斯·哈丁的脸色比平日苍白了不少，此时他很难按捺心中的怒火，可是他一句话也没有说。他又看了看被破坏了的田地和废墟处还在冒着的烟，然后回花岗石宫去了。","Cyrus Harding’s face, which was paler than usual, expressed an internal anger which he commanded with difficulty, but he did not utter a word.Once more he looked at his devastated fields, and at the smoke which still rose from the ruins, then he returned to Granite House."
"接下来的几天是移民们在这荒岛上所度过的最为悲痛的日子了！赫伯特显然变得更加虚弱。他经历的严重的生理失调留下了后患，一种更为严重的疾病正在威胁着他的状况。吉迪恩·史佩莱担心赫伯特已经没有足够的力气和不断恶化的病情作斗争！","The following days were the saddest of any that the colonists had passed on the island!Herbert’s weakness visibly increased.It appeared that a more serious malady, the consequence of the profound physiological disturbance he had gone through, threatened to declare itself, and Gideon Spilett feared such an aggravation of his condition that he would be powerless to fight against it!"
"事实上，赫伯特一直处在持续的近乎昏迷的状态中，并开始出现了神经错乱的症状。移民们手头唯一的药品就是清凉的饮料。目前他烧得还不是很严重，可是过不了多久，他可能每隔一段时间就会发热。12月6号那天，吉迪恩·史佩莱第一次发现了这种状况。","In fact, Herbert remained in an almost continuous state of drowsiness, and symptoms of delirium began to manifest themselves.Refreshing drinks were the only remedies at the colonists’ disposal.The fever was not as yet very high, but it soon appeared that it would probably recur at regular intervals.Gideon Spilett first recognized this on the 6th of December."
"可怜的少年,他的手指、鼻子和耳朵已经变得惨白，起初他的身体只是微微颤抖，浑身起了鸡皮疙瘩，还在哆嗦。他的脉搏微弱而不规则，皮肤特别干燥，口渴的状况也在不断加剧。后来很快来了一阵痉挛；他的脸开始发热，浑身通红，脉搏加快，然后在出了一身大汗之后，热度好像也随之降了下来。这一阵发作持续了差不多五个钟头。","The poor boy, whose fingers, nose, and ears had become extremely pale, was at first seized with slight shiverings, horripilations, and tremblings.His pulse was weak and irregular, his skin dry, his thirst intense.To this soon succeeded a hot fit; his face became flushed; his skin reddened; his pulse quick; then a profuse perspiration broke out after which the fever seemed to diminish.The attack had lasted nearly five hours."
"吉迪恩·史佩莱一直都没有离开赫伯特，很明显赫伯特染上了间歇热。必须不惜一切代价，在他病情恶化之前，医治好他的高烧。","Gideon Spilett had not left Herbert, who, it was only too certain, was now seized by an intermittent fever, and this fever must be cured at any cost before it should assume a more serious aspect."
"“要想把他的病治好，”史佩莱对赛勒斯·哈丁说，“我们需要找到退热药。”","“And in order to cure it,” said Spilett to Cyrus Harding, “we need a febrifuge.”"
"“退热药……”工程师回答道，“可是我们既没有奎宁皮，也没有硫酸奎宁啊。”","“A febrifuge—” answered the engineer.“We have neither Peruvian bark, nor sulphate of quinine.”"
"“不错，”吉迪恩·史佩莱说，“不过湖边有很多柳树，说不定我们可以用柳树皮替代奎宁皮。”","“No,” said Gideon Spilett, “but there are willows on the border of the lake, and the bark of the willow might, perhaps, prove to be a substitute for quinine.”"
"“那我们抓紧时间赶快试试吧。”赛勒斯·哈丁回答。","“Let us try it without losing a moment,” replied Cyrus Harding."
"的确，柳树皮和七叶树皮、冬青树叶、蛇根草等，已经被合理地当做了奎宁皮的代用品。虽然它不像奎宁皮那么名贵，但显然很有必要试一试。因为他们没有办法提取它的精华，只好不经过加工就拿来直接使用。","The bark of the willow has, indeed, been justly considered as a succedaneum for Peruvian bark, as has also that of the horse-chestnut tree, the leaf of the holly, the snake-root, etc.It was evidently necessary to make trial of this substance, although not so valuable as Peruvian bark, and to employ it in its natural state, since they had no means for extracting its essence."
"赛勒斯·史密斯从一种黑柳树上削下了几片树皮，带回到花岗石宫，把它们捣成碎末，当天晚上就让赫伯特吃了下去。","Cyrus Harding went himself to cut from the trunk of a species of black willow, a few pieces of bark; he brought them back to Granite House, and reduced them to a powder, which was administered that same evening to Herbert."
"这一夜过去了，没有出现什么重大的变化。赫伯特的神志有些昏迷，可是夜里没有再次发烧，第二天体温也没有升高。","The night passed without any important change.Herbert was somewhat delirious, but the fever did not reappear in the night, and did not return either during the following day."
"潘克洛夫的心中再一次出现了希望。吉迪恩·史佩莱什么也没有说。也许他并不是每天都发烧，而是要隔一天发作一次,可能下一天就会再一次发作。因此，他心急火燎地等待着下一天的到来。","Pencroft again began to hope.Gideon Spilett said nothing.It might be that the fever was not quotidian, but tertian, and that it would return next day.Therefore, he awaited the next day with the greatest anxiety."
"有一点可以看得出来，在这段时间里，赫伯特完全陷入了虚脱状态，他的头部无力且眩晕。另一个症状使通讯记者惊恐万分。赫伯特的肝脏开始充血了，而且很快他的神志更加不清醒，显然他的大脑也受到了影响。","It might have been remarked besides that during this period Herbert remained utterly prostrate, his head weak and giddy.Another symptom alarmed the reporter to the highest degree.Herbert’s liver became congested, and soon a more intense delirium showed that his brain was also affected."
"吉迪恩·史佩莱对这个新的并发症毫无对策。他把工程师拉到一旁。","Gideon Spilett was overwhelmed by this new complication.He took the engineer aside."
"“这是一种恶性疟疾。”他说。","“It is a malignant fever,” said he."
"“恶性疟疾！”哈丁叫道，“你弄错了，史佩莱。恶性疟疾是不可能自己产生的，一定要事先有这种病菌的存在才能发病。”","“A malignant fever!” cried Harding.“You are mistaken, Spilett.A malignant fever does not declare itself spontaneously; its germ must previously have existed.”"
"“我没弄错，”通讯记者说，“赫伯特肯定是在荒岛的沼泽地带感染上这种病菌的。他已经发作了一次；如果他再发作一次，而我们又没有办法阻止第三次发作，他就没救了。”","“I am not mistaken,” replied the reporter.“Herbert no doubt contracted the germ of this fever in the marshes of the island.He has already had one attack; should a second come on and should we not be able to prevent a third, he is lost.”"
"“可是柳树皮不管用吗？”","“But the willow bark?”"
"“那不顶用，”通讯记者回答，“如果不用奎宁，恶性疟疾的第三次发作通常都是致命的。”","“That is insufficient,” answered the reporter, “and the third attack of a malignant fever, which is not arrested by means of quinine, is always fatal.”"
"幸亏潘克洛夫没有听到他们的谈话，否则他一定会疯了。","Fortunately, Pencroft heard nothing of this conversation or he would have gone mad."
"可以想象得出，12月7号白天和接下来的一整夜，工程师和通讯记者心里会有多么着急。","It may be imagined what anxiety the engineer and the reporter suffered during the day of the 7th of December and the following night."
"将近中午的时候，恶性疟疾第二次发作。这次发病相当可怕。赫伯特觉得自己瘫痪下去了。他把胳膊伸向赛勒斯·哈丁，伸向史佩莱，伸向潘克洛夫。他还这么年轻，怎么能就这样死去！这个场面实在是令人心碎。他们只好把潘克洛夫打发到别的地方去。","Towards the middle of the day the second attack came on.The crisis was terrible.Herbert felt himself sinking.He stretched his arms towards Cyrus Harding, towards Spilett, towards Pencroft.He was so young to die!The scene was heart-rending.They were obliged to send Pencroft away."
"痉挛持续了五个钟头。赫伯特显然已经经不起第三次发作了。","The fit lasted five hours.It was evident that Herbert could not survive a third."
"这一夜是如此可怕。在神志昏迷时，赫伯特含含糊糊地说了几句话，听得他的同伴们心都碎了。他和罪犯们斗争，叫唤着艾尔顿，不断地恳求那个神秘的人——那个强大却不知名的保卫者——他的形象已经印在了赫伯特的脑海里。说完他耗尽了体力，又一次陷入了虚脱状态。有几次吉迪恩·史佩莱以为这个可怜的少年已经死了。","The night was frightful.In his delirium Herbert uttered words which went to the hearts of his companions.He struggled with the convicts, he called to Ayrton, he poured forth entreaties to that mysterious being,—that powerful unknown protector,—whose image was stamped upon his mind; then he again fell into a deep exhaustion which completely prostrated him.Several times Gideon Spilett thought that the poor boy was dead."
"第二天是12月8号，一整天赫伯特都处在昏迷的痉挛状态中。他那骨瘦如柴的双手紧紧地抓着床单。他们又给他吃了一些捣碎的树皮，可通讯记者对此并没有报什么希望。","The next day, the 8th of December, was but a succession of the fainting fits.Herbert’s thin hands clutched the sheets.They had administered further doses of pounded bark, but the reporter expected no result from it."
"“如果明天早上之前我们还没有给他找到更为有效的退热药，”通讯记者说，“赫伯特就死定了。”","“If before tomorrow morning we have not given him a more energetic febrifuge,” said the reporter, “Herbert will be dead.”"
"夜幕降临了——这恐怕是这个善良、勇敢、聪明的少年的最后一个晚上了。以他的年纪来说，他在各个方面都很出众，大家都像对待自己的孩子一样爱护着他。唯一能够治疗这种可怕的恶性疟疾的药品，唯一能够战胜疾病的特效药，在这个林肯岛上却是找不到的。","Night arrived—the last night, it was too much to be feared, of the good, brave, intelligent boy, so far in advance of his years, and who was loved by all as their own child.The only remedy which existed against this terrible malignant fever, the only specific which could overcome it, was not to be found in Lincoln Island."
"12月8号夜里，赫伯特精神错乱得更加严重。他的肝脏充血已经达到可怕的程度，大脑也受到了感染，他已经认不出任何一个人了。","During the night of the 8th of December, Herbert was seized by a more violent delirium.His liver was fearfully congested, his brain affected, and already it was impossible for him to recognize any one."
"等到病情第三次发作时，病魔肯定会把他带走的，他还能活到第二天吗？恐怕不能了。他的体力已经耗尽了，在发烧的间歇期间，他像个死人一样躺在那里。","Would he live until the next day, until that third attack which must infallibly carry him off?It was not probable.His strength was exhausted, and in the intervals of fever he lay as one dead."
"夜里将近三点的时候，赫伯特发出一声尖叫。他的身体好像要被极度的痉挛撕裂了似的。纳布当时离他不远，听到他的叫声吓了一跳，赶忙跑到他的同伴们所在的房间。","Towards three o’clock in the morning Herbert uttered a piercing cry.He seemed to be torn by a supreme convulsion.Neb, who was near him, terrified, ran into the next room where his companions were watching."
"这时，托普也莫名其妙地大叫起来。","Top, at that moment, barked in a strange manner."
"所有人急忙冲进屋去，试图让这个垂死的少年平静下来。这时赫伯特快要滚下了床，史佩莱抓住他的胳膊，感到他的脉搏正在逐渐加快。","All rushed in immediately and managed to restrain the dying boy, who was endeavoring to throw himself out of his bed, while Spilett, taking his arm, felt his pulse gradually quicken."
"当时是清晨五点。正在升起的太阳开始照进花岗石宫的窗户。它预示着这将会是一个晴朗的日子，然而，这却是可怜的赫伯特的最后一天了！","It was five in the morning.The rays of the rising sun began to shine in at the windows of Granite House.It promised to be a fine day, and this day was to be poor Herbert’s last!"
"一束阳光照在床边的桌子上。","A ray glanced on the table placed near the bed."
"突然，潘克洛夫手指着桌子，大叫了一声。","Suddenly Pencroft, uttering a cry, pointed to the table."
"桌子上放着一个长方形的小盒子，盒子的封皮上写着几个字：“硫酸奎宁”。","On it lay a little oblong box, of which the cover bore these words:—“SULPHATE OF QUININE.”"
"第十一章","Chapter 11"
"吉迪恩·史佩莱拿起盒子，把它打开。盒子里面装着大概200格令的白色粉末，他蘸了一点尝了尝。粉末极度的苦味打消了所有的怀疑，这确实是经过提炼的宝贵的奎宁——最有效的退热药。","Gideon Spilett took the box and opened it.It contained nearly two hundred grains of a white powder, a few particles of which he carried to his lips.The extreme bitterness of the substance precluded all doubt; it was certainly the precious extract of quinine, that pre-eminent antifebrile."
"必须让赫伯特吃下这种药粉，一刻也不能耽搁。至于它的来历，不妨以后再去讨论。","This powder must be administered to Herbert without delay.How it came there might be discussed later."
"“来点咖啡！”史佩莱说。","“Some coffee!” said Spilett."
"不一会儿，纳布端过来一杯温热的咖啡。吉迪恩·史佩莱往里面加了大概18格令的奎宁。他们顺利地让赫伯特喝下了这种混合液体。","In a few moments Neb brought a cup of the warm infusion.Gideon Spilett threw into it about eighteen grains of quinine, and they succeeded in making Herbert drink the mixture."
"在恶性疟疾第三次发作之前，他们还有一点时间。他们多么希望这段时间一直延长下去，疾病再也不会发作了！","There was still time, for the third attack of the malignant fever had not yet shown itself.How they longed to be able to add that it would not return!"
"这里还必须强调一点，此刻每个人的心里都再次充满希望。那股神秘的力量又发挥了作用，就在这个大家已经绝望的紧要关头。","Besides, it must be remarked, the hopes of all had now revived.The mysterious influence had been again exerted, and in a critical moment, when they had despaired of it."
"一个钟头之后，赫伯特平静了很多。现在移民们可以讨论一下这件事情了。这一次，陌生人的介入比以往更加明显。可是，他在夜里怎么能进入花岗石宫呢？这一点着实不可思议，事实上，岛上这位天才的行为和他本人一样神秘莫测。这一天，他们每隔三个钟头就让赫伯特吃一次硫酸奎宁。","In a few hours Herbert was much calmer.The colonists could now discuss this incident.The intervention of the stranger was more evident than ever.But how had he been able to penetrate during the night into Granite House?It was inexplicable, and, in truth, the proceedings of the genius of the island were not less mysterious than was that genius himself.During this day the sulphate of quinine was administered to Herbert every three hours."
"第二天，赫伯特的病情明显好转了。当然，他还没有脱离危险，间歇热一般都会复发，而且一旦复发就会很危险，但大家对他的照顾无微不至，此外，他们手头还有特效药，同时，毫无疑问，那个送药的人也在不远的地方！每个人的心里都再次出现了希望。","The next day some improvement in Herbert’s condition was apparent.Certainly, he was not out of danger, intermittent fevers being subject to frequent and dangerous relapses, but the most assiduous care was bestowed on him.And besides, the specific was at hand; nor, doubtless, was he who had brought it far distant!And the hearts of all were animated by returning hope."
"这次他们的希望没有落空。十天之后，也就是12月20号，赫伯特开始复原了。","This hope was not disappointed.Ten days after, on the 20th of December, Herbert’s convalescence commenced."
"他的身体依旧很虚弱，并且他被大家严格地限制饮食，但他再也没有发过高烧。可怜的少年特别顺从地遵守了所有对他的规定！他是多么希望痊愈！","He was still weak, and strict diet had been imposed upon him, but no access of fever supervened.And then, the poor boy submitted with such docility to all the prescriptions ordered him!He longed so to get well!"
"潘克洛夫像是一个从深渊底部被救上来的人似的，高兴得近乎发狂了。预计病情第三次发作的时间过去之后，他紧紧地抱着通讯记者，近乎将其窒息。从那一刻开始，他常常把通讯记者叫做史佩莱医生。","Pencroft was as a man who has been drawn up from the bottom of an abyss.Fits of joy approaching delirium seized him.When the time for the third attack had passed by, he nearly suffocated the reporter in his embrace.Since then, he always called him Dr. Spilett."
"然而，他们还是没有发现真正的医生。","The real doctor, however, remained undiscovered."
"“我们一定会找到他！”水手一再地说。","“We will find him!” repeated the sailor."
"可以肯定，不管这个人是谁，一旦找到了他，潘克洛夫都应当为他送上一个热烈的拥抱！","Certainly, this man, whoever he was, might expect a somewhat too energetic embrace from the worthy Pencroft!"
"12月已经结束，1867年也随之逝去。在这一年的年底，林肯岛的移民们遭受了严峻的考验。1868年年初，天气晴朗炎热，温度像热带地区一样高，幸而有海风送来丝丝凉爽。赫伯特正在逐渐恢复健康，他的床就放在花岗石宫的一个窗口附近，他可以呼吸含着臭氧的新鲜空气，这对于恢复健康是大有好处的。他的食欲也跟着恢复了，纳布为他精心准备了多少美味可口的菜肴啊！","The month of December ended, and with it the year 1867, during which the colonists of Lincoln Island had of late been so severely tried.They commenced the year 1868 with magnificent weather, great heat, and a tropical temperature, delightfully cooled by the sea-breeze.Herbert’s recovery progressed, and from his bed, placed near one of the windows of Granite House, he could inhale the fresh air, charged with ozone, which could not fail to restore his health.His appetite returned, and what numberless delicate, savory little dishes Neb prepared for him!"
"“能吃到这么多好吃的，谁都想发烧了！”潘克洛夫说。","“It is enough to make one wish to have a fever oneself!” said Pencroft."
"在这段时间里，罪犯们一直没有在花岗石宫附近出现过。他们也没有任何艾尔顿的消息，虽然工程师和赫伯特依旧对重新找到他抱有希望，他们的同伴们却都相信这个不幸的人已经死了。不管怎样，这个疑问不会存在太久的，一旦少年康复了，他们就可以远征了。远征的结果将会有非常重大的意义。但是他们或许还要等上一个月，因为要向罪犯们讨还血债，移民们的全部力量都要出动。","During all this time, the convicts did not once appear in the vicinity of Granite House.There was no news of Ayrton, and though the engineer and Herbert still had some hopes of finding him again, their companions did not doubt but that the unfortunate man had perished.However, this uncertainty could not last, and when once the lad should have recovered, the expedition, the result of which must be so important, would be undertaken.But they would have to wait a month, perhaps, for all the strength of the colony must be put into requisition to obtain satisfaction from the convicts."
"不过，赫伯特的健康恢复得很快。肝脏已经不再充血，伤口看上去也完全愈合了。","However, Herbert’s convalescence progressed rapidly.The congestion of the liver had disappeared, and his wounds might be considered completely healed."
"1月里，眺望岗的高地上完成了重要的工作，虽然工作的内容近乎相同，就是把遭劫后遗留下来的庄稼，不管是谷物还是蔬菜，都尽可能地贮藏起来。他们把麦粒和植物聚集在一起，留到即将到来的半个季度重新播种。至于家禽场的围墙和驴棚的重建工作，赛勒斯·哈丁打算先等等。当他和他的同伴们出去追踪罪犯的时候，罪犯们很可能再次到高地扫荡，给他们机会再次破坏这里，实在是没有必要。等到把岛上的罪犯们肃清之后，他们可以着手重建工作。在1月的第二个星期里，少年开始下床了，起初他每天起来一个钟头，后来是两个钟头，再后来是三个钟头。由于他原本身强体健，体力很快恢复了。今年他十八岁。身材很高，将来定会长成一位仪表堂堂的男子汉。从这个时候起，他的健康，虽然还需要休养——这是史佩莱医生严格要求的——恢复得特别快。月底的时候，赫伯特已经可以在眺望岗和海滩上散步了。","During the month of January, important work was done on the plateau of Prospect Heights; but it consisted solely in saving as much as was possible from the devastated crops, either of corn or vegetables.The grain and the plants were gathered, so as to provide a new harvest for the approaching half-season.With regard to rebuilding the poultry-yard, wall, or stables, Cyrus Harding preferred to wait.While he and his companions were in pursuit of the convicts, the latter might very probably pay another visit to the plateau, and it would be useless to give them an opportunity of recommencing their work of destruction. when the island should be cleared of these miscreants, they would set about rebuilding.The young convalescent began to get up in the second week of January, at first for one hour a day, then two, then three.His strength visibly returned, so vigorous was his constitution.He was now eighteen years of age.He was tall, and promised to become a man of noble and commanding presence.From this time his recovery, while still requiring care,—and Dr. Spilett was very strict,—made rapid progress.Towards the end of the month, Herbert was already walking about on Prospect Heights, and the beach."
"他和潘克洛夫、纳布一起洗过几次海水浴，对他的恢复有很大的好处。赛勒斯·哈丁觉得该定下出发的日期了，于是就定在了2月15号动身。在一年中的这个时节，夜晚非常晴朗，这对于全方位地搜索这个小岛非常有利。","He derived, from several sea-baths, which he took in company with Pencroft and Neb, the greatest possible benefit.Cyrus Harding thought he might now settle the day for their departure, for which the 15th of February was fixed.The nights, very clear at this time of year, would be favorable to the researches they intended to make all over the island."
"于是他们开始进行远征必要的准备工作，这一点非常重要，因为移民们已经下定了决心，不达到双重目标，他们决不回花岗石宫——一方面他们要歼灭罪犯，如果艾尔顿没有死，还要把他营救出来；另一方面他们要找出真正掌握着移民们的命运的那个人。","The necessary preparations for this exploration were now commenced, and were important, for the colonists had sworn not to return to Granite House until their twofold object had been achieved; on the one hand, to exterminate the convicts, and rescue Ayrton, if he was still living; on the other, to discover who it was that presided so effectually over the fortunes of the colony."
"在林肯岛上，从爪角到颚骨角之间的整个东海岸、宽阔的潦凫沼泽、格兰特湖的周围、通往畜栏和慈悲河的啄木鸟林、慈悲河和红河流域，以及富兰克林山的支脉，也就是建畜栏的地方，移民们已经有了彻底的了解。","Of Lincoln Island, the settlers knew thoroughly all the eastern coast from Claw Cape to the Mandible Capes, the extensive Tadorn Marsh, the neighborhood of Lake Grant, Jacamar Wood, between the road to the corral and the Mercy, the courses of the Mercy and Red Creek, and lastly, the spurs of Mount Franklin, among which the corral had been established."
"还有一些地方，比如从爪角到爬虫角之间华盛顿湾的宽阔海岸、西海岸上的森林和沼泽、一直延绵到鲨鱼湾港口的看不到尽头的沙丘等，尽管知道得还不那么彻底，但也已经探索过了。但是覆盖盘蛇半岛的森林、慈悲河右边的整个区域、瀑布河的左岸。支撑富兰克林山麓东、西、北三面支脉和山谷的荒野，他们还都没有探索过，毫无疑问，这些地方会有很多可以藏身的秘密之地。如此说来，岛上还有上百万英亩的土地没有被他们探索过。","They had explored, though only in an imperfect manner, the vast shore of Washington Bay from Claw Cape to Reptile End, the woody and marshy border of the west coast, and the interminable downs, ending at the open mouth of Shark Gulf.But they had in no way surveyed the woods which covered the Serpentine Peninsula, all to the right of the Mercy, the left bank of Falls River, and the wilderness of spurs and valleys which supported three quarters of the base of Mount Franklin, to the east, the north, and the west, and where doubtless many secret retreats existed.Consequently, many millions of acres of the island had still escaped their investigations."
"因此，他们决定开始远征，深入到远西地带去，连通慈悲河右边的整个区域一起搜索。","It was, therefore, decided that the expedition should be carried through the Far West, so as to include all that region situated on the right of the Mercy."
"也许直接到畜栏去是个更好的方法，因为罪犯们很可能再次躲到那里去了，不管是为了劫掠，还是为了安身。可是现在罪犯们可能已经把畜栏破坏了，想去阻止他们已经来不及了；也可能他们还坚守在里面，如果是这样的话，等到他们回来的时候再把他们赶走也不迟。","It might, perhaps, be better worth while to go direct to the corral, where it might be supposed that the convicts had again taken refuge, either to pillage or to establish themselves there.But either the devastation of the corral would have been an accomplished fact by this time, and it would be too late to prevent it, or it had been the convicts’ interest to entrench themselves there, and there would be still time to go and turn them out on their return."
"于是，经过了一番讨论之后，移民们决定采取第一个计划：穿过森林，到爬虫角去。他们用短柄小斧开辟出一条十六七英里长的道路，使花岗石宫一直通到半岛的末端。","Therefore, after some discussion, the first plan was adhered to, and the settlers resolved to proceed through the wood to Reptile End.They would make their way with their hatchets, and thus lay the first draft of a road which would place Granite House in communication with the end of the peninsula for a length of from sixteen to seventeen miles."
"手推车完好无损。野驴在休息好了之后，可以参加到远征中。食品、露营用具、便携火炉和各种器皿都已经装在了手推车上，他们又从已经相当完善的花岗石宫的兵器库里仔细地挑选了一些武器和火药。但是，有一点必须牢记，罪犯们也许正在森林里游荡，走在茂密的森林中，很可能会被冷枪击中。因此，这一小队移民们决定集体行动，无论以什么样的理由，谁都不准掉队。","The cart was in good condition.The onagers, well rested, could go a long journey.Provisions, camp effects, a portable stove, and various utensils were packed in the cart, as also weapons and ammunition, carefully chosen from the now complete arsenal of Granite House.But it was necessary to remember that the convicts were, perhaps, roaming about the woods, and that in the midst of these thick forests a shot might quickly be fired and received.It was therefore resolved that the little band of settlers should remain together and not separate under any pretext whatever."
"大家还决定，花岗石宫里一个人也不留。托普和贾普也都随同一起参加远征，这个很难进入的住处不需要有人留守。2月14号是出发的前夕，移民们休息了一整天，并向造物主表达了一番感恩之情。虽然赫伯特已经完全恢复了，但是他的身体还是有些虚弱，于是他们就在手推车上给他留出了一个空位。赛勒斯·哈丁为了防止花岗石宫遭到侵犯，在第二天拂晓时分采取了一些必要的措施。过去用来攀登的梯子被拿到了“石窟”，他们把它深深地埋在了沙子里，留到日后他们回来时用，因为升降梯已经被他们拆成了一块一块的零部件，整套装置一点也没有留下。最后只剩下潘克洛夫一个人在花岗石宫里完成这项工作。干完之后，他沿着一根下端被人拉着的两股的绳子荡了下来，接着把绳子扯下，就这样断绝了高处的平台和海滩之间的交通。","It was also decided that no one should remain at Granite House.Top and Jup themselves were to accompany the expedition; the inaccessible dwelling needed no guard.The 14th of February, eve of the departure, was consecrated entirely to repose, and—thanksgiving addressed by the colonists to the Creator.A place in the cart was reserved for Herbert, who, though thoroughly convalescent, was still a little weak.The next morning, at daybreak, Cyrus Harding took the necessary measures to protect Granite House from any invasion.The ladders, which were formerly used for the ascent, were brought to the Chimneys and buried deep in the sand, so that they might be available on the return of the colonists, for the machinery of the lift had been taken to pieces, and nothing of the apparatus remained.Pencroft stayed the last in Granite House in order to finish this work, and he then lowered himself down by means of a double rope held below, and which, when once hauled down, left no communication between the upper landing and the beach."
"这一天天气十分晴朗。","The weather was magnificent."
"“今天可真暖和！”通讯记者笑着说。","“We shall have a warm day of it,” said the reporter, laughing."
"“噗！史佩莱医生！”潘克洛夫说，“我们应该走在树阴底下，这样连太阳都看不见！”","“Pooh!Dr. Spilett,” answered Pencroft, “we shall walk under the shade of the trees and shan’t even see the sun!”"
"“前进！”工程师说。","“Forward!” said the engineer."
"手推车停在了“石窟”前面的海滩上。通讯记者让赫伯特上了车，要他在旅途的前几个钟头坐在他的位置上，少年只好听医生的吩咐。","The cart was waiting on the beach before the Chimneys.The reporter made Herbert take his place in it during the first hours at least of the journey, and the lad was obliged to submit to his doctor’s orders."
"纳布牵着野驴往前走。赛勒斯·哈丁、通讯记者和水手走在车的前面。托普高兴地蹦蹦跳跳。赫伯特在车上给贾普腾了个位子，贾普毫不客气地坐了上去。动身的时刻到了，一小队人马出发了。","Neb placed himself at the onagers’ heads.Cyrus Harding, the reporter, and the sailor, walked in front.Top bounded joyfully along.Herbert offered a seat in his vehicle to Jup, who accepted it without ceremony.The moment for departure had arrived, and the little band set out."
"小车首先绕过了慈悲河口的拐角，接着沿着左岸往上走了一英里，跨过桥，到了通向气球港的路，然后移民们从路口往右走，进入了茂密的森林，这里就是远西地带了。","The cart first turned the angle of the mouth of the Mercy, then, having ascended the left bank for a mile, crossed the bridge, at the other side of which commenced the road to Port Balloon, and there the explorers, leaving this road on their left, entered the cover of the immense woods which formed the region of the Far West."
"最初的两英里，树木稀少，小车还可以顺利通行；只是有时需要砍断一些爬藤和灌木，但这一段路途中，移民们没有遇到什么严重的障碍。","For the first two miles the widely scattered trees allowed the cart to pass with ease; from time to time it became necessary to cut away a few creepers and bushes, but no serious obstacle impeded the progress of the colonists."
"浓密的枝叶在地上形成了树阴，似乎在向人们致谢。喜马拉雅雪杉、花旗松、木麻黄树、山茂、桉树、龙血树和其他许多有名的品种，在目之所及的地方，一棵连着一棵。岛上的各种鸟类在这里应有尽有——松鸡、啄木鸟、野鸡、吸蜜鹦鹉以及唧唧喳喳叫个不停的美冠鹦鹉、鹦鹉和长尾鹦鹉。看到人群走了过来，刺豚鼠、袋鼠和水豚飞也似的逃走了，这一切都勾起了移民们的回忆，让他们想到了来到岛上以后第一次打猎时的情景。","The thick foliage of the trees threw a grateful shade on the ground.Deodars, Douglas firs, casuarinas, banksias, gum-trees, dragon-trees, and other well-known species, succeeded each other far as the eye could reach.The feathered tribes of the island were all represented—grouse, jacamars, pheasants, lories, as well as the chattering cockatoos, parrots, and paroquets.Agouties, kangaroos, and capybaras fled swiftly at their approach; and all this reminded the settlers of the first excursions they had made on their arrival at the island."
"“不过，”赛勒斯·哈丁说，“我发现这些动物，不管是飞禽还是走兽，都比以前胆小了。这么看来，罪犯们最近肯定是从这里走过，我们一定能找到他们的踪迹的。”","“Nevertheless,” observed Cyrus Harding, “I notice that these creatures, both birds and quadrupeds, are more timid than formerly.These woods have, therefore, been recently traversed by the convicts, and we shall certainly find some traces of them.”"
"果不其然，他们找到了几处小队人马最近通过这里时留下的痕迹，有的地方的树枝被折断了，大概是为了做记号；有的地方留下了一些灰烬，粘土地上还有一些脚印，但是找不到任何宿营留下的痕迹。","And, in fact, in several places they could distinguish traces, more or less recent, of the passage of a band of men—here branches broken off the trees, perhaps to mark out the way; there the ashes of a fire, and footprints in clayey spots; but nothing which appeared to belong to a settled encampment."
"工程师已经劝告他的同伴们停止打猎了。也许罪犯们正在森林里游荡，枪声很可能会惊动了他们。另外，要打猎的话势必就要离开小车一段距离，留下它没人看管是十分危险的。","The engineer had recommended his companions to refrain from hunting.The reports of the firearms might give the alarm to the convicts, who were, perhaps, roaming through the forest.Moreover, the hunters would necessarily ramble some distance from the cart, which it was dangerous to leave unguarded."
"到了后半天，他们离开花岗石宫大概六英里了，前进的道路变得困难了很多。为了穿过茂密的树林，他们不得不砍倒一些树。在进入这样的地方之前，哈丁总是很小心地让托普和贾普先进去，它们总是忠实地完成他们的任务。如果狗和猩猩没有做出任何警告地回来，显然前面一段路就没有什么危险，既没有罪犯，也没有野兽。这两只来自动物世界的生灵凶残的本性不相上下。第一天晚上，移民们在离花岗石宫九英里左右的一条汇入慈悲河的溪流旁边安营扎寨，之前他们一直不知道有这条小溪，显然它的水路系统使附近的土壤变得十分肥沃。移民们胃口大开，于是便饱餐了一顿，然后安排如何平安地过夜。如果工程师只需要应付野兽，比如美洲豹或其他兽类，那么他只需要在帐篷周围点上篝火就足以防御他们的进攻；可是这样一来，罪犯们不但不会被吓跑，反而会被吸引过来，于是他还是决定把自己包围在漆黑的夜色之中。","In the afterpart of the day, when about six miles from Granite House, their progress became much more difficult.In order to make their way through some thickets, they were obliged to cut down trees.Before entering such places Harding was careful to send in Top and Jup, who faithfully accomplished their commission, and when the dog and orang returned without giving any warning, there was evidently nothing to fear, either from convicts or wild beasts, two varieties of the animal kingdom, whose ferocious instincts placed them on the same level.On the evening of the first day the colonists encamped about nine miles from Granite House, on the border of a little stream falling into the Mercy, and of the existence of which they had till then been ignorant; it evidently, however, belonged to the hydiographical system to which the soil owed its astonishing fertility.The settlers made a hearty meal, for their appetites were sharpened, and measures were then taken that the night might be passed in safety.If the engineer had had only to deal with wild beasts, jaguars or others, he would have simply lighted fires all around his camp, which would have sufficed for its defense; but the convicts would be rather attracted than terrified by the flames, and it was, therefore, better to be surrounded by the profound darkness of night."
"他们精心地组织守夜。大家一致同意两个人一组共同守夜，每隔两个小时换一组。尽管赫伯特提出想要守夜，大家还是没有答应。潘克洛夫和吉迪恩·史佩莱一组，工程师和纳布一组，轮流在帐篷周围看守。","The watch was, however, carefully organized.Two of the settlers were to watch together, and every two hours it was agreed that they should be relieved by their comrades.And so, notwithstanding his wish to the contrary, Herbert was exempted from guard.Pencroft and Gideon Spilett in one party, the engineer and Neb in another, mounted guard in turns over the camp."
"然而，夜晚不过只有几个钟头。与其说黑暗是因为没有太阳而造成的，还不如说是由于枝叶太过浓密造成的。森林里的寂静被不时传来的美洲豹的吼声和猿猴的叫声打破了，贾普似乎特别不喜欢听猴子叫。这一夜平安无事地过去了，第二天是2月15号，大家继续在森林中穿行，虽然不时会遇到一些困难，但是枯燥乏味却一路相随。这一天他们走了不到六英里，因为他们每走一步都要用短柄小斧开路。","The night, however, was but of few hours.The darkness was due rather to the thickness of the foliage than to the disappearance of the sun.The silence was scarcely disturbed by the howling of jaguars and the chattering of the monkeys, the latter appearing to particularly irritate Master Jup.The night passed without incident, and on the next day, the 15th of February, the journey through the forest, tedious rather than difficult, was continued.This day they could not accomplish more than six miles, for every moment they were obliged to cut a road with their hatchets."
"移民们就像定居在这里的人一样，仅仅砍倒一些小树，而把那些高大且美丽的树留了下来，这样做还有一个原因就是砍倒大树需要花费许多劳动力。可是这样一来，开辟出的道路格外弯曲，一个接一个的弯路延长了他们的路程。","Like true settlers, the colonists spared the largest and most beautiful trees, which would besides have cost immense labor to fell, and the small ones only were sacrificed, but the result was that the road took a very winding direction, and lengthened itself by numerous detours."
"这一天赫伯特发现了很多以前在岛上没有遇到过的植物种类，比如叶子像喷泉似的四面散开的桫椤，还有上面长着野驴很喜欢吃的长荚和一种香甜可口的果肉的刺槐。在那里，移民们还发现了几丛高大的贝壳杉。它们的树干是圆柱形的，高达200尺，顶上有一簇锥形的树叶。贝壳松是新西兰的万树之王，和黎巴嫩的杉树一样有名。","During the day Herbert discovered several new specimens not before met with in the island, such as the tree-fern, with its leaves spread out like the waters of a fountain, locust-trees, on the long pods of which the onagers browsed greedily, and which supplied a sweet pulp of excellent flavor.There, too, the colonists again found groups of magnificent kauries, their cylindrical trunks, crowded with a cone of verdure, rising to a height of two hundred feet.These were the tree-kings of New Zealand, as celebrated as the cedars of Lebanon."
"至于动物，除了猎人们已经见过的那些以外，他们没有发现什么新的种类。然而，虽然不能靠近，他们却看见了两只澳大利亚特有的大飞禽，一种名叫鸸鹋的食火鸡，身高五英尺，长着棕色的羽毛，属于涉水鸟类。托普撒开四条腿，拼命地追赶它们，但是鸸鹋跑得特别快，轻而易举地就把它甩在了后面。","As to the fauna, there was no addition to those species already known to the hunters.Nevertheless, they saw, though unable to get near them, a couple of those large birds peculiar to Australia, a sort of cassowary, called emu, five feet in height, and with brown plumage, which belong to the tribe of waders.Top darted after them as fast as his four legs could carry him, but the emus distanced him with ease, so prodigious was their speed."
"至于罪犯们留下的踪迹，他们又发现了一些。在一处很明显是近期熄灭的余烬周围，移民们发现了一些脚印，并进行了仔细的检查。他们一一测量了脚印的长度和宽度，很容易就辨别出了这些是五个人留下的脚印。这五个罪犯肯定在这里露营过。如果有第六个人的脚印，那肯定是艾尔顿留下的，可是他们经过仔细的检查，并没有发现第六个人的脚印。","As to the traces left by the convicts, a few more were discovered.Some footprints found near an apparently recently extinguished fire were attentively examined by the settlers.By measuring them one after the other, according to their length and breadth, the marks of five men’s feet were easily distinguished.The five convicts had evidently camped on this spot; but,—and this was the object of so minute an examination,—a sixth footprint could not be discovered, which in that case would have been that of Ayrton."
"“艾尔顿没有和他们在一起！”赫伯特说。","“Ayrton was not with them!” said Herbert."
"“没错，”潘克洛夫答道，“如果他没有和他们在一起，那么一定是已经被罪犯们杀了！这些恶棍连个窝都没有，不然我们就能据此像追老虎一样追他们了！”","“No,” answered Pencroft, “and if he was not with them, it was because the wretches had already murdered him! but then these rascals have not a den to which they may be tracked like tigers!”"
"“没错，”通讯记者说，“他们大概在到处游荡，目的在于有一天能成为这个岛的主人！”","“No,” replied the reporter, “it is more probable that they wander at random, and it is their interest to rove about until the time when they will be masters of the island!”"
"“岛上的主人！”水手大声地说，“岛上的主人！……”他重复着，好像被人用手牢牢地抓住了喉咙一样，说不出话来。然后他的声音平静了一些，“你知道吗，哈丁队长，”他说，“我的枪里装的是一颗什么子弹？”","“The masters of the island!” exclaimed the sailor; “the masters of the island!...” he repeated, and his voice was choked, as if his throat was seized in an iron grasp.Then in a calmer tone, “Do you know, Captain Harding,” said he, “what the ball is which I have rammed into my gun?”"
"“不知道，潘克洛夫！”","“No, Pencroft!”"
"“就是那颗射穿了赫伯特的胸膛的子弹，我跟你保证，它一定会击中目标！”","“It is the ball that went through Herbert’s chest, and I promise you it won’t miss its mark!”"
"但是，这个合理的报复不能使艾尔顿死而复生。在检查了地上留下的脚印之后，唉，他们不能不得出结论，他们必须放弃任何与他再次相见的念头了。","But this just retaliation would not bring Ayrton back to life, and from the examination of the footprints left in the ground, they must, alas! conclude that all hopes of ever seeing him again must be abandoned."
"那天晚上，他们在距离花岗石宫十四英里的地方安营扎寨。赛勒斯·哈丁估算出，还有不到五英里，他们就能到爬虫角了。","That evening they encamped fourteen miles from Granite House, and Cyrus Harding calculated that they could not be more than five miles from Reptile Point."
"果然，第二天他们到达了半岛的尽头，他们已经纵穿了整个森林，但是没有发现任何迹象表明罪犯们在那里藏身，也没有找到那个神秘的陌生人的住处。","And indeed, the next day the extremity of the peninsula was reached, and the whole length of the forest had been traversed; but there was nothing to indicate the retreat in which the convicts had taken refuge, nor that, no less secret, which sheltered the mysterious unknown."
"第十二章","Chapter 12"
"第二天，2月18号，移民们打算搜索从爬虫角到瀑布河沿岸一带的森林地区。移民们可以对这片森林进行彻底的搜索，因为这里地处盘蛇半岛的两岸之间，宽度只有三到四英里。这里的树木不仅高大，而且枝繁叶茂，这足以证明这里的土壤要比荒岛其他的地方肥沃很多。人们也许会以为,这里是从美洲或非洲迁移到这个温带地区来的一片原始森林。这使他们得出结论，这些高大的植物所生长的地方的土壤一定比较热。这里的土壤表层潮湿，但内部由于火山烈焰而温度升高；这种温度在温带气候里是不可能出现的。这一带最为常见的树木是高大的贝壳松和尤加利树。","The next day, the 18th of February, was devoted to the exploration of all that wooded region forming the shore from Reptile End to Falls River.The colonists were able to search this forest thoroughly, for, as it was comprised between the two shores of the Serpentine Peninsula, it was only from three to four miles in breadth.The trees, both by their height and their thick foliage, bore witness to the vegetative power of the soil, more astonishing here than in any other part of the island.One might have said that a corner from the virgin forests of America or Africa had been transported into this temperate zone.This led them to conclude that the superb vegetation found a heat in this soil, damp in its upper layer, but warmed in the interior by volcanic fires, which could not belong to a temperate climate.The most frequently occurring trees were knaries and eucalypti of gigantic dimensions."
"当然移民们的目的可不仅仅在于欣赏这些参天大树。他们知道，在这方面，林肯岛已经完全可以列入到最初被称为“快乐群岛”的加纳利的第一流岛屿的行列了。可现在，唉！林肯岛已经不完全归他们所有了，已经有其他人侵占了它，污染了它的海岸，他们必须把这些罪消灭，一个不留。","But the colonists’ object was not simply to admire the magnificent vegetation.They knew already that in this respect Lincoln Island would have been worthy to take the first rank in the Canary group, to which the first name given was that of the Happy Isles.Now, alas! their island no longer belonged to them entirely; others had taken possession of it, miscreants polluted its shores, and they must be destroyed to the last man."
"尽管他们检查得非常仔细，可并没有在西海岸上发现任何蛛丝马迹。没有脚印，没有折断的树枝，也没有被遗弃的帐篷。","No traces were found on the western coast, although they were carefully sought for.No more footprints, no more broken branches, no more deserted camps."
"“这一点我倒不觉得奇怪，”赛勒斯·哈丁对他的同伴们说，“罪犯们最初在遗物角附近登上小岛，在穿过漆凫沼泽之后，立刻进入远西森林。然后他们几乎是沿着我们离开‘花岗石宫’后所走的同样的路线前进。这就可以解释我们在森林里发现的那些踪迹。可是罪犯们到达海岸之后，很快就发现那里没有适合他们居住的地方，就在那时，他们决定再次往北走，于是就找到了畜栏。”","“This does not surprise me,” said Cyrus Harding to his companions.“The convicts first landed on the island in the neighborhood of Flotsam Point, and they immediately plunged into the Far West forests, after crossing Tadorn Marsh.They then followed almost the same route that we took on leaving Granite House.This explains the traces we found in the wood.But, arriving on the shore, the convicts saw at once that they would discover no suitable retreat there, and it was then that, going northwards again, they came upon the corral.”"
"“说不准他们已经回到了那里。”潘克洛夫说。","“Where they have perhaps returned,” said Pencroft."
"“我不这么认为，”工程师回答道，“他们自然会认为我们要往那个方向寻找他们。对他们来说，畜栏只不过是个仓库，而不是可以长期居住的地方。”","“I do not think so,” answered the engineer, “for they would naturally suppose that our researches would be in that direction.The corral is only a storehouse to them, and not a definitive encampment.”"
"“我同意赛勒斯的观点，”通讯记者说，“我想，罪犯们一定是把他们的老窝扎在富兰克林山的支脉之间了。”","“I am of Cyrus’ opinion,” said the reporter, “and I think that it is among the spurs of Mount Franklin that the convicts will have made their lair.”"
"“那么，队长，我们径直去畜栏！”潘克洛夫大声地说，“我们一定要把他们杀光！到目前为止，我们完全是在浪费时间！”","“Then, captain, straight to the corral!” cried Pencroft.“We must finish them off, and till now we have only lost time!”"
"“不，我的朋友，”工程师说，“你忘了我们还想知道远西森林里有没有什么住所。我们的远征有两个目的，潘克洛夫。一方面我们固然要严惩罪犯，另一方面，我们还要感激别人。”","“No, my friend,” replied the engineer; “you forget that we have a reason for wishing to know if the forests of the Far West do not contain some habitation.Our exploration has a double object, Pencroft.If, on the one hand, we have to chastise crime, we have, on the other, an act of gratitude to perform.”"
"“说得对，队长，”水手说，“可是怎么都一样，在我看来，如果那位先生不愿意露面，我们是不会找到他的。”","“That was well said, captain,” replied the sailor, “but, all the same, it is my opinion that we shall not find the gentleman until he pleases.”"
"实际上，潘克洛夫一语中的，道破了所有人的想法。陌生人的住处大概和他本人一样神秘莫测。","And truly Pencroft only expressed the opinion of all.It was probable that the stranger’s retreat was not less mysterious than was he himself."
"那天晚上，他们把小车停在了瀑布河的河口，和往常一样搭起帐篷，轮流守夜。赫伯特现在已经和他生病之前一样，又是一个健康而强壮的少年了。这种户外的生活，既有海上吹来的微风，又有林间新鲜的空气，对他的恢复有很大的好处。现在他不再坐在车上，而是走在了队伍的最前面。","That evening the cart halted at the mouth of Falls River.The camp was organized as usual, and the customary precautions were taken for the night.Herbert, become again the healthy and vigorous lad he was before his illness, derived great benefit from this life in the open air, between the sea breezes and the vivifying air from the forests.His place was no longer in the cart, but at the head of the troop."
"转天，2月19号，移民们离开了海岸——在那里，河口的上面，各种形状的玄武岩石堆砌在一起，形成了一个奇特的图案——沿着河的左岸爬了上去。他们之前从畜栏走到西海岸的时候，已经把这条路其中的一部分铺平了。现在移民们离富兰克林山还有大概六英里。","The next day, the 19th of February, the colonists, leaving the shore, where, beyond the mouth, basalts of every shape were so picturesquely piled up, ascended the river by its left bank.The road had been already partly cleared in their former excursions made from the corral to the west coast.The settlers were now about six miles from Mount Franklin."
"工程师的计划是这样的：仔细地查看形成河床的山谷，小心地朝畜栏附近靠近；如果畜栏被人占领了，就用武力把它夺过来，如果没有人，他们就守在那里，把它作为探索富兰克林山的前进据点。","The engineer’s plan was this:—To minutely survey the valley forming the bed of the river, and to cautiously approach the neighborhood of the corral; if the corral was occupied, to seize it by force; if it was not, to entrench themselves there and make it the center of the operations which had for their object the exploration of Mount Franklin."
"移民们一致通过了这个计划，因为他们已经迫不及待地想要收回整个小岛的所有权。","This plan was unanimously approved by the colonists, for they were impatient to regain entire possession of their island."
"一道狭窄的峡谷把富兰克林山两座最大的支脉划分开，他们沿着这道峡谷前进。河岸上长满了树木，到了高处的山坡上，树木就变得十分稀少了。这一带地势高低不平，非常适合打埋伏，因此他们前进时特别小心。托普和贾普在两边茂密的灌木丛上跳来跳去，赛着谁更聪明谁更灵活。溪流的岸上没有任何迹象可以说明近来常有人经过这里，没有任何迹象可以说明有罪犯在这里出现或是靠近过这里。傍晚五点钟的时候，小车停在了离栅栏差不多600英尺的地方。栅栏藏在了围成半圆形的树后面。","They made their way then along the narrow valley separating two of the largest spurs of Mount Franklin.The trees, crowded on the river’s bank, became rare on the upper slopes of the mountain.The ground was hilly and rough, very suitable for ambushes, and over which they did not venture without extreme precaution.Top and Jup skirmished on the flanks, springing right and left through the thick brushwood, and emulating each other in intelligence and activity.But nothing showed that the banks of the stream had been recently frequented—nothing announced either the presence or the proximity of the convicts.Towards five in the evening the cart stopped nearly 600 feet from the palisade.A semicircular screen of trees still hid it."
"现在有必要去侦察一下畜栏，看看那里是不是已经被别人侵占。罪犯们很可能埋伏在那里，在光天化日之下，如果大摇大摆地走过去，很可能会像可怜的赫伯特一样，将自己暴露在恶棍们的枪口之下。所以最好还是等到夜幕降临再说。","It was necessary to reconnoiter the corral, in order to ascertain if it was occupied.To go there openly, in broad daylight, when the convicts were probably in ambush, would be to expose themselves, as poor Herbert had done, to the firearms of the ruffians.It was better, then, to wait until night came on."
"然而，吉迪恩·史佩莱却认为不能再耽搁，应该立刻侦查通往畜栏的路，潘克洛夫也已经急不可耐，自告奋勇地陪他一起去。","However, Gideon Spilett wished without further delay to reconnoiter the approaches to the corral, and Pencroft, who was quite out of patience, volunteered to accompany him."
"“不，朋友们，”工程师说，“等到夜里吧。我绝不会允许你们其中的任何一个在白天暴露了自己。”","“No, my friends,” said the engineer, “wait till night.I will not allow one of you to expose himself in open day.”"
"“可是，队长……”水手依旧不死心。","“But, captain—” answered the sailor, little disposed to obey."
"“我求求你，潘克洛夫。”工程师说。","“I beg of you, Pencroft,” said the engineer."
"“好吧！”水手说，他换了一种途径宣泄心中的愤怒，用海上生活的人们常用的最难听的话，辱骂那伙罪犯。","“Very well!” replied the sailor, who vented his anger in another way, by bestowing on the convicts the worst names in his maritime vocabulary."
"于是，移民们留守在小车旁边，小心翼翼地观察着森林周围的动静。","The colonists remained, therefore, near the cart, and carefully watched the neighboring parts of the forest."
"三个钟头就这样过去了。风已经小了，大树下面一片寂静。即便是折断一根小树枝，脚踩到干枯的树叶上，还是身子从草地上滑过发出的声音，都可以毫不费力听得清清楚楚。一切都很安静。就连托普都趴在草地上，把头搁在爪子上，没有表现出一点不安的样子。八点钟的时候，天色已经很晚了，这种条件十分有利于侦查。吉迪恩·史佩莱表示他已经做好准备，和潘克洛夫一起出发。赛勒斯·哈丁同意了。他们把托普和贾普留在工程师、赫伯特和纳布身边，因为在不恰当时刻的一声咆哮或者尖叫，都会引起罪犯们的警觉。","Three hours passed thus.The wind had fallen, and absolute silence reigned under the great trees.The snapping of the smallest twig, a footstep on the dry leaves, the gliding of a body among the grass, would have been heard without difficulty.All was quiet.Besides, Top, lying on the grass, his head stretched out on his paws, gave no sign of uneasiness.At eight o’clock the day appeared far enough advanced for the reconnaissance to be made under favorable conditions.Gideon Spilett declared himself ready to set out accompanied by Pencroft.Cyrus Harding consented.Top and Jup were to remain with the engineer, Herbert, and Neb, for a bark or a cry at a wrong moment would give the alarm."
"“不要大意，”哈丁对通讯记者和潘克洛夫说，“你们不需要占领畜栏，只要弄清楚它是不是已经被人占领了。”","“Do not be imprudent,” said Harding to the reporter and Pencroft, “you have not to gain possession of the corral, but only to find out whether it is occupied or not.”"
"“好的。”潘克洛夫说。","“All right,” answered Pencroft."
"于是他们两个出发了。","And the two departed."
"大树枝繁叶茂，树下一片漆黑，三四十英尺之外，就什么都看不见了。通讯记者和潘克洛夫极为小心地往前走，一听到可疑的声音就立刻停下来。","Under the trees, thanks to the thickness of their foliage, the obscurity rendered any object invisible beyond a radius of from thirty to forty feet.The reporter and Pencroft, halting at any suspicious sound, advanced with great caution."
"他们彼此保持着一小段距离，这样可以减小成为射击目标的几率。老实说，他们随时都等待着听到枪声。离开小车五分钟之后，吉迪恩·史佩莱和潘克洛夫到达了森林边缘的空地前面，过了空地就是畜栏的栅栏了。","They walked a little distance apart from each other so as to offer a less mark for a shot.And, to tell the truth, they expected every moment to hear a report.Five minutes after leaving the cart, Gideon Spilett and Pencroft arrived at the edge of the wood before the clearing beyond which rose the palisade."
"他们停了下来。在这片没有树的空地上，还有几缕隐隐约约的光线。30英尺远的地方就是畜栏的大门，看上去是关着的。想要从森林到达栅栏，必须要通过这中间的30英尺，如果借用弹道学上的一个名词，这段距离就是“危险区”。事实上，不管是谁闯进“危险区”都有可能被从栅栏后面射出的子弹击倒。吉迪恩·史佩莱和水手都不是临阵脱逃的人，但是他们深知，一个不小心，不但自己会首先成为牺牲品，还会牵连到他们的同伴。如果他们被杀了，哈丁、纳布和赫伯特能逃脱得了吗？","They stopped.A few straggling beams still fell on the field clear of trees.Thirty feet distant was the gate of the corral, which appeared to be closed.This thirty feet, which it was necessary to cross from the wood to the palisade, constituted the dangerous zone, to borrow a ballistic term: in fact, one or more bullets fired from behind the palisade might knock over any one who ventured on to this zone.Gideon Spilett and the sailor were not men to draw back, but they knew that any imprudence on their part, of which they would be the first victims, would fall afterwards on their companions.If they themselves were killed, what would become of Harding, Neb, and Herbert?"
"潘克洛夫认为罪犯们肯定已经在畜栏里住下了，而现在自己又离畜栏这么近，一想到这里，他就按捺不住心里的兴奋，想要往前走。通讯记者一手把他紧紧地抓住了。","But Pencroft, excited at feeling himself so near the corral where he supposed the convicts had taken refuge, was about to press forward, when the reporter held him back with a grasp of iron."
"“过不了多久天就能黑透了，”史佩莱凑到水手的耳边，悄声地说，“到那时再行动。”","“In a few minutes it will be quite dark,” whispered Spilett in the sailor’s ear, “then will be the time to act.”"
"潘克洛夫焦躁不安地握着枪托，尽量克制心中的激动，一面等待时机，一面诅咒。","Pencroft, convulsively clasping the butt-end of his gun, restrained his energies, and waited, swearing to himself."
"不久之后，最后一道光线消失了。黑暗好像从浓密的森林中间袭来，笼罩在整片空地上。富兰克林山就像一道竖立在西边水平线上的巨大的屏幕。在纬度较低的地方，黑夜总是来得这么快。到了该行动的时候了。","Soon the last of the twilight faded away.Darkness, which seemed as if it issued from the dense forest, covered the clearing.Mount Franklin rose like an enormous screen before the western horizon, and night spread rapidly over all, as it does in regions of low latitudes.Now was the time."
"通讯记者和潘克洛夫已经到了森林的边缘，目光一刻不离地盯着栅栏。看上去畜栏里一个人也没有。栅栏的顶部形成了一条线，比周围的阴影处还要黑一些，旁边没有任何东西阻挡。然而，如果罪犯们在那里，他们一定会派一个人在那里看守，以防遭到突然袭击。","The reporter and Pencroft, since posting themselves on the edge of the wood, had not once lost sight of the palisade.The corral appeared to be absolutely deserted.The top of the palisade formed a line, a little darker than the surrounding shadow, and nothing disturbed its distinctness.Nevertheless, if the convicts were there, they must have posted one of their number to guard against any surprise."
"史佩莱抓住他的同伴的手，一起朝着畜栏匍匐前进，随时准备开枪。","Spilett grasped his companion’s hand, and both crept towards the corral, their guns ready to fire."
"他们来到了畜栏的大门，周围一片漆黑，一道光线也没有。","They reached the gate without the darkness being illuminated by a single ray of light."
"潘克洛夫想推开门，但正如通讯记者和他想象的那样，门是关着的。不过，水手能确认外边的门闩没有闩上。因此，可以得出结论，罪犯们就在畜栏里，他们八成把大门从里面闩上了，从外面是推不开的。","Pencroft tried to push open the gate, which, as the reporter and he had supposed, was closed.However, the sailor was able to ascertain that the outer bars had not been put up.It might, then, be concluded that the convicts were there in the corral, and that very probably they had fastened the gate in such a way that it could not be forced open."
"吉迪恩·史佩莱和潘克洛夫听了一会儿。","Gideon Spilett and Pencroft listened."
"栅栏里面什么声音都没有。摩弗仑羊和山羊肯定在牲口棚里睡着了，丝毫没有打破夜晚的宁静。","Not a sound could be heard inside the palisade.The musmons and the goats, sleeping no doubt in their huts, in no way disturbed the calm of night."
"通讯记者和水手什么也没听见，他们自己思忖着，要不要翻过栅栏到畜栏里面去。但是这样做就违反了赛勒斯·哈丁的指示。","The reporter and the sailor hearing nothing, asked themselves whether they had not better scale the palisades and penetrate into the corral.This would have been contrary to Cyrus Harding’s instructions."
"的确，这样冒险可能会成功，但也可能会失败。现在，如果罪犯们还没有怀疑，如果他们一点也不知道移民们远征搜索他们，那样的话，是有突袭的机会的。如果轻率地翻过栅栏会不会错失这样的机会呢？","It is true that the enterprise might succeed, but it might also fail.Now, if the convicts were suspecting nothing, if they knew nothing of the expedition against them, if, lastly, there now existed a chance of surprising them, ought this chance to be lost by inconsiderately attempting to cross the palisades?"
"这并不是通讯记者的想法。他觉得最好还是等到所有的移民们都聚集在一起之后，再尝试进入畜栏。有一点是可以肯定的，他们可以到达栅栏而且没有被发现，另外，畜栏看上去并没有人把守。这一点已经弄清楚了，他们就应该回到小车那里和大家进行商讨去了。","This was not the reporter’s opinion.He thought it better to wait until all the settlers were collected together before attempting to penetrate into the corral.One thing was certain, that it was possible to reach the palisade without being seen, and also that it did not appear to be guarded.This point settled, there was nothing to be done but to return to the cart, where they would consult."
"潘克洛夫大概也同意了这个决定，因为通讯记者转身回森林的时候，他没有反对，而是跟了回来。","Pencroft probably agreed with this decision, for he followed the reporter without making any objection when the latter turned back to the wood."
"几分钟以后，工程师了解了目前的状况。","In a few minutes the engineer was made acquainted with the state of affairs."
"“好吧，”他思考了一会儿，然后说，“我现在有理由相信，罪犯们不在畜栏里。”","“Well,” said he, after a little thought, “I now have reason to believe that the convicts are not in the corral.”"
"“我们很快就会知道了，”潘克洛夫说，“等我们翻过栅栏以后。”","“We shall soon know,” said Pencroft, “when we have scaled the palisade.”"
"“去畜栏，朋友们！”赛勒斯·哈丁说。","“To the corral, my friends!” said Cyrus Harding."
"“我们把小车留在森林里吗？”纳布问。","“Shall we leave the cart in the wood?” asked Neb."
"“不，”工程师回答，“它可是我们的军火和粮食车，有必要的时候，它还能成为我们的堑壕。”","“No,” replied the engineer, “it is our wagon of ammunition and provisions, and, if necessary, it would serve as an entrenchment.”"
"“那么，前进！”吉迪恩·史佩莱说。","“Forward, then!” said Gideon Spilett."
"小车出了森林，悄悄地朝栅栏驶去。现在夜色非常黑暗，周围还是和刚才潘克洛夫和通讯记者爬过空地时一样的寂静。他们走在厚厚的杂草上，一点声音都没有。移民们保持警惕，时刻准备开枪。贾普听从潘克洛夫的话，呆在了后面。纳布用绳子拴着托普，好阻止它往前跑。","The cart emerged from the wood and began to roll noiselessly towards the palisade.The darkness was now profound, the silence as complete as when Pencroft and the reporter crept over the ground.The thick grass completely muffled their footsteps.The colonists held themselves ready to fire.Jup, at Pencroft’s orders, kept behind.Neb led Top in a leash, to prevent him from bounding forward."
"空地很快就在眼前了。一个人都没有。小队毫不犹豫地移动到栅栏那里。在很短的时间里他们就走过了“危险区”。纳布把缰绳拴在了野驴头上。工程师、通讯记者、赫伯特和潘克洛夫走到门口，看看门到底是不是从里面关着。门是开着的！","The clearing soon came in sight.It was deserted.Without hesitating, the little band moved towards the palisade.In a short space of time the dangerous zone was passed.Neb remained at the onagers’ heads to hold them.The engineer, the reporter, Herbert, and Pencroft, proceeded to the door, in order to ascertain if it was barricaded inside.It was open!"
"“这下你们怎么解释？”工程师向水手和史佩莱问道。","“What do you say now?” asked the engineer, turning to the sailor and Spilett."
"他们两个都愣住了。","Both were stupefied."
"“我敢发誓，”潘克洛夫说，“刚才这扇门绝对是关着的！”","“I can swear,” said Pencroft, “that this gate was shut just now!”"
"移民们犹豫起来了。潘克洛夫和通讯记者来侦察的时候，罪犯们在畜栏里面吗？毫无疑问，如果当时门是关着的，那么肯定是他们把门打开了。他们现在还在里面，还是有一个罪犯刚出去呢？","The colonists now hesitated.Were the convicts in the corral when Pencroft and the reporter made their reconnaissance?It could not be doubted, as the gate then closed could only have been opened by them.Were they still there, or had one of their number just gone out?"
"所有的问题都同时出现在移民们的脑海里，但是这些问题要怎么来回答呢？","All these questions presented themselves simultaneously to the minds of the colonists, but how could they be answered?"
"赫伯特已经往栅栏里面走了几步，就在那时候又突然退了出来，抓住了哈丁的手。","At that moment, Herbert, who had advanced a few steps into the enclosure, drew back hurriedly, and seized Harding’s hand."
"“怎么了？”工程师问。","“What’s the matter?” asked the engineer."
"“有光！”","“A light!”"
"“屋子里？”","“In the house?”"
"“是的！”","“Yes!”"
"五个人一起冲了过去。果然，穿过面前的窗户，他们看见有一道微弱的光线在闪动着。赛勒斯·哈丁果断地做了决定。“这是我们唯一的机会，”他对同伴们说，“赶上罪犯们聚集在这个屋子里，没有产生任何怀疑！他们在我们的控制之下！前进！”移民们穿过栅栏，手里拿着已经准备好的枪。小车留在了外面，由贾普和托普看管，它们已经被谨慎地拴在了车上。","All five advanced and indeed, through the window fronting them, they saw glimmering a feeble light.Cyrus Harding made up his mind rapidly.“It is our only chance,” said he to his companions, “of finding the convicts collected in this house, suspecting nothing!They are in our power!Forward!”The colonists crossed through the enclosure, holding their guns ready in their hands.The cart had been left outside under the charge of Jup and Top, who had been prudently tied to it."
"赛勒斯·哈丁、潘克洛夫和吉迪恩·史佩莱在一边，赫伯特和纳布在另一边，在漆黑冷清的畜栏里沿着栅栏往前走。","Cyrus Harding, Pencroft, and Gideon Spilett on one side, Herbert and Neb on the other, going along by the palisade, surveyed the absolutely dark and deserted corral."
"不久之后他们就到了关着的房门附近。","In a few moments they were near the closed door of the house."
"哈丁向同伴们做了个手势，叫他们不要动，自己朝着被屋里微弱的光线照亮的窗户靠近。","Harding signed to his companions not to stir, and approached the window, then feebly lighted by the inner light."
"他朝屋里张望了一下。","He gazed into the apartment."
"桌子上面点着一盏灯。桌子旁边是艾尔顿以前睡的床。","On the table burned a lantern.Near the table was the bed formerly used by Ayrton."
"床上躺着一个人。","On the bed lay the body of a man."
"突然，赛勒斯·哈丁退了回来，用沙哑的声音喊道：“艾尔顿！”","Suddenly Cyrus Harding drew back, and in a hoarse voice,—“Ayrton!” he exclaimed."
"移民们立刻破门而入，冲到了屋子里。","Immediately the door was forced rather than opened, and the colonists rushed into the room."
"艾尔顿好像睡着了。从他的脸色可以看出，他经受了长期而残酷的折磨。他的手腕和脚踝上都有大片的伤痕。","Ayrton appeared to be asleep.His countenance showed that he had long and cruelly suffered.On his wrists and ankles could be seen great bruises."
"哈丁朝他弯下了身。","Harding bent over him."
"“艾尔顿！”工程师抓着他的胳膊大声地叫，他们实在是没有预料到会在这种情况下找到他。","“Ayrton!” cried the engineer, seizing the arm of the man whom he had just found again under such unexpected circumstances."
"听到喊声，艾尔顿睁开了眼，先是看了看哈丁，又看了看其他的人。","At this exclamation Ayrton opened his eyes, and, gazing at Harding, then at the others,—"
"“你们！”他叫道，“是你们吗？”","“You!” he cried, “you?”"
"“艾尔顿！艾尔顿！”哈丁重复地叫着。","“Ayrton!Ayrton!” repeated Harding."
"“这是在哪儿？”","“Where am I?”"
"“在畜栏的房子里！”","“In the house in the corral!”"
"“就我们俩？”","“Alone?”"
"“是的！”","“Yes!”"
"“可是他们会回来的！”艾尔顿大声说，“保护好自己！保护好自己！”","“But they will come back!” cried Ayrton.“Defend yourselves! defend yourselves!”"
"他耗尽了体力，晕了过去。","And he fell back exhausted."
"“史佩莱，”工程师大声说，“我们随时都可能遭到进攻。把小车拉到畜栏里来。然后，闩上门，所有人都回到这儿来。","“Spilett,” exclaimed the engineer, “we may be attacked at any moment.Bring the cart into the corral.Then, barricade the door, and all come back here.”"
"潘克洛夫、纳布和通讯记者急忙去执行工程师的命令。一刻也不能耽搁。说不定现在小车已经落到罪犯们的手上了！","Pencroft, Neb, and the reporter hastened to execute the engineer’s orders.There was not a moment to be lost.Perhaps even now the cart was in the hands of the convicts!"
"通讯记者和他的两个同伴很快就穿过畜栏，到了栅栏门口。这时托普正在后面愠怒地叫着。","In a moment the reporter and his two companions had crossed the corral and reached the gate of the palisade behind which Top was heard growling sullenly."
"工程师暂时离开了艾尔顿，走到外面准备开枪。赫伯特就在他的旁边。他们都在观察畜栏上方的支脉顶峰处的动静。如果罪犯们埋伏在那里，他们可以把移民们一个接一个地都打死。","The engineer, leaving Ayrton for an instant, came out ready to fire.Herbert was at his side.Both surveyed the crest of the spur overlooking the corral.If the convicts were lying in ambush there, they might knock the settlers over one after the other."
"这时候，月亮从东方升起来了，悬挂在森林的黑幕上空，一抹白色的月光洒在栅栏里面。畜栏里面茂盛的树木、浇灌它的小溪和遍地的野草，一时间都被照亮了。从山的那边看，房屋和一部分栅栏在月光照映下白得很显眼。大门对面的栅栏处还黑着。不久之后，一团黑漆漆的东西出现了。小车出现在月光照射的范围内，当同伴们关门上闩时，赛勒斯·哈丁能听到门发出的声音。","At that moment the moon appeared in the east, above the black curtain of the forest, and a white sheet of light spread over the interior of the enclosure.The corral, with its clumps of trees, the little stream which watered it, its wide carpet of grass, was suddenly illuminated.From the side of the mountain, the house and a part of the palisade stood out white in the moonlight.On the opposite side towards the door, the enclosure remained dark.A black mass soon appeared.This was the cart entering the circle of light, and Cyrus Harding could hear the noise made by the door, as his companions shut it and fastened the interior bars."
"但是，就在那一刻，托普挣脱了束缚，开始愤怒地狂叫，冲向了畜栏的后面，也就是房子的右边。","But, at that moment, Top, breaking loose, began to bark furiously and rush to the back of the corral, to the right of the house."
"“准备开枪，朋友们！”哈丁大声地说。","“Be ready to fire, my friends!” cried Harding."
"移民们举起了枪，随时准备射击。","The colonists raised their pieces and waited the moment to fire."
"托普还在不停地叫，贾普朝托普跑去，也发出尖锐的叫声。","Top still barked, and Jup, running towards the dog, uttered shrill cries."
"移民们跟着贾普，来到了大树遮挡下的小溪边。在皎洁的月光下，他们看到了什么？五具尸体，四仰八叉地躺在河岸上！","The colonists followed him, and reached the borders of the little stream, shaded by large trees.And there, in the bright moonlight, what did they see?Five corpses, stretched on the bank!"
"他们正是四个月之前，在林肯岛上登陆的那伙罪犯！","They were those of the convicts who, four months previously, had landed on Lincoln Island!"
"第十三章","Chapter 13"
"这到底是怎么回事？是谁杀了这些罪犯？是艾尔顿吗？不会啊，刚才他还担心罪犯们会回来呢！","How had it happened? who had killed the convicts?Was it Ayrton?No, for a moment before he was dreading their return."
"但是艾尔顿现在陷入了深度昏迷中，不太可能把他叫起来。自从刚才说完了那几句话，他就失去了知觉，一动不动地躺在床上。","But Ayrton was now in a profound stupor, from which it was no longer possible to rouse him.After uttering those few words he had again become unconscious, and had fallen back motionless on the bed."
"移民们百思不得其解，感到非常纳闷。由于极度兴奋，他们在艾尔顿的房间里等了整整一夜，再也没有回到躺着罪犯们的尸体的地方去。很可能艾尔顿也不能解释这些尸体是怎么回事，因为他连自己在畜栏里都不知道。但是至少他能给大家讲讲这个恐怖的场面发生之前的情况。第二天，艾尔顿从昏迷状态中苏醒过来。在分别了104天之后，看到他几乎安然无恙，同伴们发自内心地表现出极度的喜悦。","The colonists, a prey to a thousand confused thoughts, under the influence of violent excitement, waited all night, without leaving Ayrton’s house, or returning to the spot where lay the bodies of the convicts.It was very probable that Ayrton would not be able to throw any light on the circumstances under which the bodies had been found, since he himself was not aware that he was in the corral.But at any rate he would be in a position to give an account of what had taken place before this terrible execution.The next day Ayrton awoke from his torpor, and his companions cordially manifested all the joy they felt, on seeing him again, almost safe and sound, after a hundred and four days separation."
"艾尔顿简短地讲述了事情的经过——至少是讲了他所知道的一切。","Ayrton then in a few words recounted what had happened, or, at least, as much as he knew."
"去年的11月10号，也就是他到达畜栏的第二天晚上，罪犯们翻过栅栏，突袭了他。他们把他绑了起来，堵住他的嘴，然后把他带到富兰克林山麓的一个黑暗的山洞里，那儿就是他们的巢穴。","The day after his arrival at the corral, on the 10th of last November, at nightfall, he was surprised by the convicts, who had scaled the palisade.They bound and gagged him; then he was led to a dark cavern, at the foot of Mount Franklin, where the convicts had taken refuge."
"他们决定把他杀死。第二天，他们正准备杀他的时候，其中的一个罪犯认出了他，并叫出了他在澳洲出生时使用过的名字。如果是艾尔顿，他们肯定会毫不犹豫地把他杀了！可眼前这个人是彭·觉斯，他们把他留了下来！","His death had been decided upon, and the next day the convicts were about to kill him, when one of them recognized him and called him by the name which he bore in Australia.The wretches had no scruples as to murdering Ayrton!They spared Ben Joyce!"
"但是，从这一刻开始，艾尔顿要直面他过去的同谋的强求。他们希望他能重新入伙，依靠他的帮助，进入他们至今仍未能接近的花岗石宫，占领那里，杀死那里的移民们，成为这个岛的主人！","But from that moment Ayrton was exposed to the importunities of his former accomplices.They wished him to join them again, and relied upon his aid to enable them to gain possession of Granite House, to penetrate into that hitherto inaccessible dwelling, and to become masters of the island, after murdering the colonists!"
"艾尔顿的态度始终坚定不移。这个昔日的罪犯，现在已经悔过自新并得到了宽恕；他宁可牺牲自己的性命，也不愿背叛他的同伴们。艾尔顿被绑着手脚，堵着嘴，在这个山洞里被密切监视了四个月。","Ayrton remained firm.The once convict, now repentant and pardoned, would rather die than betray his companions.Ayrton—bound, gagged, and closely watched—lived in this cave for four months."
"虽然，在到达这个岛上不久，罪犯们就发现了畜栏，并且，从那时候起，他们一直依靠艾尔顿储存的食物生存，但是他们始终没有住在畜栏里。","Nevertheless the convicts had discovered the corral a short time after their arrival in the island, and since then they had subsisted on Ayrton’s stores, but did not live at the corral."
"11月11号，移民们的到来让其中的两个匪徒大吃一惊，他们朝赫伯特开枪，其中的一个跑了回去，向其他的罪犯们夸耀说自己打死了岛上的一个居民，可是他却是一个人回来的。前面已经说过了，他的同伴被赛勒斯·哈丁用匕首杀死了。","On the 11th of November, two of the villains, surprised by the colonists’ arrival, fired at Herbert, and one of them returned, boasting of having killed one of the inhabitants of the island; but he returned alone.His companion, as is known, fell by Cyrus Harding’s dagger."
"可以想象得出，艾尔顿得知赫伯特牺牲的消息时，有多么的不安和绝望。现在只剩下四个移民了，而他们似乎还处在罪犯们的魔爪之下。这件事情之后，在移民们因赫伯特养伤而耽搁在畜栏里的这段时间里，海盗们一直没有离开山洞，甚至在他们掠夺了眺望岗的高地之后，为了谨慎起见，他们还是没有放弃这里。","Ayrton’s anxiety and despair may be imagined when he learned the news of Herbert’s death.The settlers were now only four, and, as it seemed, at the mercy of the convicts.After this event, and during all the time that the colonists, detained by Herbert’s illness, remained in the corral, the pirates did not leave their cavern, and even after they had pillaged the plateau of Prospect Heights, they did not think it prudent to abandon it."
"这时候，他们变本加厉地折磨艾尔顿。由于他整天都被绑着，手上和脚上到现在还有绳子留下的血痕。看上去是没有什么逃走的可能性了，眼下他最希望的就是赶紧被处死。","The ill-treatment inflicted on Ayrton was now redoubled.His hands and feet still bore the bloody marks of the cords which bound him day and night.Every moment he expected to be put to death, nor did it appear possible that he could escape."
"这种情况一直持续到了二月份的第三个礼拜。罪犯们很少离开他们的老巢，仅仅是有的时候到荒岛的内陆或南岸一带打过几次猎，但是他们一直在等待着有利的时机。","Matters remained thus until the third week of February.The convicts, still watching for a favorable opportunity, rarely quitted their retreat, and only made a few hunting excursions, either to the interior of the island, or the south coast."
"在这之后艾尔顿一直没有听到关于他的同伴们的消息，他已经不再奢望见他们一面了。最后，这个不幸的人被折磨得日渐虚弱，陷入了虚脱状态，视觉和听觉都严重地减退了。也就是说，从那时起的两天以来发生的所有事情他都一无所知。","Ayrton had no further news of his friends, and relinquished all hope of ever seeing them again.At last, the unfortunate man, weakened by ill-treatment, fell into a prostration so profound that sight and hearing failed him.From that moment, that is to say, since the last two days, he could give no information whatever of what had occurred."
"“但是，哈丁队长，”他补充道，“既然我被囚禁在那个山洞里，我怎么会到畜栏里来呢？”","“But, Captain Harding,” he added, “since I was imprisoned in that cavern, how is it that I find myself in the corral?”"
"“罪犯们又怎么会死在栅栏里面呢？”工程师反问道。","“How is it that the convicts are lying yonder dead, in the middle of the enclosure?” answered the engineer."
"“死了！”艾尔顿不顾身体的虚弱，从床上半撑起身子大叫道。","“Dead!” cried Ayrton, half rising from his bed, notwithstanding his weakness."
"同伴们扶着他。他想要爬起来，在同伴们的帮助下，他下了床。于是他们一同向小溪边上走去。","His companions supported him.He wished to get up, and with their assistance he did so.They then proceeded together towards the little stream."
"这时天已经大亮了。","It was now broad daylight."
"就在河边上，躺着五个罪犯的尸体，从他们的样子看上去应该是刚被打死不久。","There, on the bank, in the position in which they had been stricken by death in its most instantaneous form, lay the corpses of the five convicts!"
"艾尔顿愣住了。哈丁和他的同伴们看着他，一句话也没有说。纳布和潘克洛夫按照工程师的手势，去检查那些已经已经被冻得僵直的尸体。","Ayrton was astounded.Harding and his companions looked at him without uttering a word.On a sign from the engineer, Neb and Pencroft examined the bodies, already stiffened by the cold."
"尸体上并没有什么明显的伤痕。","They bore no apparent trace of any wound."
"经过仔细的检查，潘克洛夫才发现第一具尸体的额头上、第二具尸体的胸膛上、第三具尸体的后背上、第四具尸体的肩膀上各有一个小红点。这是一种很难被发现的创伤，他们还很难推测出到底是怎么形成的。","Only, after carefully examining them, Pencroft found on the forehead of one, on the chest of another, on the back of this one, on the shoulder of that, a little red spot, a sort of scarcely visible bruise, the cause of which it was impossible to conjecture."
"“他们就是在这里被打中的！”赛勒斯·哈丁说。","“It is there that they have been struck!” said Cyrus Harding."
"“可是用的是什么样的武器呢？”通讯记者大声地问道。","“But with what weapon?” cried the reporter."
"“这种武器的效果就像闪电一样，不过我们还不知道它的秘密！”","“A weapon, lightning-like in its effects, and of which we have not the secret!”"
"“那是谁打的呢？”潘克洛夫问。","“And who has struck the blow?” asked Pencroft."
"“岛上的复仇者，”哈丁回答，“艾尔顿，就是他把你带到这儿来的。他又一次发挥了他的威力，这一路上他总是在我们遇到解决不了的问题时帮助我们，又总是在帮了我们之后避开我们。”","“The avenging power of the island,” replied Harding, “he who brought you here, Ayrton, whose influence has once more manifested itself, who does for us all that which we cannot do for ourselves, and who, his will accomplished, conceals himself from us.”"
"“那么，我们去找他吧！”潘克洛夫叫道。","“Let us make search for him, then!” exclaimed Pencroft."
"“是的，我们会去找他，”哈丁说，“可是，在他愿意让我们见到他之前，我们是没有办法找到这个创造了这么多奇迹的伟大人物的！”","“Yes, we will search for him,” answered Harding, “but we shall not discover this powerful being who performs such wonders, until he pleases to call us to him!”"
"这种让他们的行动变得一点用处都没有的看不见的保护让工程师又烦恼又着急。这种相形见绌的情况往往会伤害一个人的自尊心。用拒绝别人感恩的方法来表明自己的慷慨，这也包含了一种瞧不起受惠人的成分，因此，在赛勒斯·哈丁心中，在某种程度上，这样反而在某种程度上降低了这一切的价值。","This invisible protection, which rendered their own action unavailing, both irritated and piqued the engineer.The relative inferiority which it proved was of a nature to wound a haughty spirit.A generosity evinced in such a manner as to elude all tokens of gratitude, implied a sort of disdain for those on whom the obligation was conferred, which in Cyrus Harding’s eyes marred, in some degree, the worth of the benefit."
"“我们去找吧，”他接着说，“但愿有一天我们能够向这位高傲的保护者证明，他说做的一切并不是为了一群忘恩负义的人！要是我们能够报答他，能够轮到我们为他做点什么，即使要付出生命的代价，我又有什么理由不答应呢？”","“Let us search,” he resumed, “and God grant that we may some day be permitted to prove to this haughty protector that he has not to deal with ungrateful people!What would I not give could we repay him, by rendering him in our turn, although at the price of our lives, some signal service!”"
"从这一天开始，林肯岛上的居民们的思想就完全被寻找这个人占据着。所有的事情都激励他们去探索这个谜题的答案，这个答案只有可能是一个被赋予了真正的不可思议的能力，甚至某种程度上是超凡能力的人的名字。","From this day, the thoughts of the inhabitants of Lincoln Island were solely occupied with the intended search.Everything incited them to discover the answer to this enigma, an answer which would only be the name of a man endowed with a truly inexplicable, and in some degree superhuman power."
"几分钟之后，移民们回到了屋子里。在他们的照料下，艾尔顿的精神和体力很快就恢复了很多。纳布和潘克洛夫把罪犯们的尸体运到了离畜栏不远处的森林里，并深埋起来。","In a few minutes, the settlers re-entered the house, where their influence soon restored to Ayrton his moral and physical energy.Neb and Pencroft carried the corpses of the convicts into the forest, some distance from the corral, and buried them deep in the ground."
"他们向艾尔顿讲述了在他被囚禁的这段时间里发生的所有事情。他这才知道赫伯特遭受的危险和移民们经历的种种考验。移民们原本已经对再次见到艾尔顿不抱有什么希望了，他们以为罪犯们已经残忍地把他杀死了。","Ayrton was then made acquainted with the facts which had occurred during his seclusion.He learned Herbert’s adventures, and through what various trials the colonists had passed.As to the settlers, they had despaired of ever seeing Ayrton again, and had been convinced that the convicts had ruthlessly murdered him."
"“现在，”赛勒斯·哈丁讲完了之后接着说，“我们还有一件事要办。我们的任务只完成了一半，虽然以后我们不必再害怕那群罪犯，但是我们重新成为这个岛的主人并不是依靠我们自己的力量实现的。”","“And now,” said Cyrus Harding, as he ended his recital, “a duty remains for us to perform.Half of our task is accomplished, but although the convicts are no longer to be feared, it is not owing to ourselves that we are once more masters of the island.”"
"“好吧！”吉迪恩·史佩莱说，“我们去搜索富兰克林山支脉那一带复杂的地区吧。我们不会放过任何一个山谷或洞穴！啊！假如有一位通讯记者发现了这个秘密，朋友们，这个人一定是正在和你们说话的我！”","“Well!” answered Gideon Spilett, “let us search all this labyrinth of the spurs of Mount Franklin.We will not leave a hollow, not a hole unexplored!Ah! if ever a reporter found himself face to face with a mystery, it is I who now speak to you, my friends!”"
"“如果找不到那位恩人，我们就不回‘花岗石宫’。”赫伯特说。","“And we will not return to Granite House until we have found our benefactor,” said Herbert."
"“是的，”工程师说，“凡是人力能达到的，我们都要去做。但是我要重申的是，在他愿意见我们之前，恐怕我们是不会找到他的。”","“Yes,” said the engineer, “we will do all that it is humanly possible to do, but I repeat we shall not find him until he himself permits us.”"
"“我们就呆在畜栏里吗？”潘克洛夫问。","“Shall we stay at the corral?” asked Pencroft."
"“是的，”哈丁回答，“这里有足够的粮食，而且又正好是我们要搜索的范围的中心。再有，在必要的时候，大车可以让我们迅速回到‘花岗石宫’。”","“We shall stay here,” answered Harding.“Provisions are abundant, and we are here in the very center of the circle we have to explore.Besides, if necessary, the cart will take us rapidly to Granite House.”"
"“好！”水手说，“不过我还要提醒一件事。”","“Good!” answered the sailor.“Only I have a remark to make.”"
"“什么事？”","“What is it?”"
"“现在正值好季节，我们不能忘了我们还要航海。”","“Here is the fine season getting on, and we must not forget that we have a voyage to make.”"
"“航海？”吉迪恩·史佩莱问。","“A voyage?” said Gideon Spilett."
"“是啊，去达抱岛，”潘克洛夫回答说，“必须给那里送个信儿，告诉他们我们这个岛的位置，还要说明艾尔顿在这儿以便苏格兰游船来这儿把他接走。说不定现在已经来不及了，谁知道呢？”","“Yes, to Tabor Island,” answered Pencroft.“It is necessary to carry a notice there to point out the position of our island and say that Ayrton is here in case the Scotch yacht should come to take him off.Who knows if it is not already too late?”"
"“可是，潘克洛夫，”艾尔顿问道，“你打算怎么航海呢？”","“But, Pencroft,” asked Ayrton, “how do you intend to make this voyage?”"
"“用‘乘风破浪号’。”","“In the ‘Bonadventure.’”"
"“‘乘风破浪号’！”艾尔顿大声地说，“早就不复存在了。”","“The ‘Bonadventure!’” exclaimed Ayrton.“She no longer exists.”"
"“我的‘乘风破浪号’不存在了？”潘克洛夫从座位上跳了起来，大声叫道。","“My ‘Bonadventure’ exists no longer!” shouted Pencroft, bounding from his seat."
"“不在了，”艾尔顿说，“八天之前，罪犯们在小港湾里发现了它，乘着它出海，后来……”","“No,” answered Ayrton.“The convicts discovered her in her little harbor only eight days ago, they put to sea in her—”"
"“怎么样了？”潘克洛夫心跳得厉害，一个劲儿追问。","“And?” said Pencroft, his heart beating."
"“因为没有鲍勃·哈维掌舵，他们撞到了石头上，把船撞得粉碎。”","“And not having Bob Harvey to steer her, they ran on the rocks, and the vessel went to pieces.”"
"“啊！这些强盗、土匪、不知廉耻的家伙！”潘克洛夫大骂起来。","“Oh, the villains, the cutthroats, the infamous scoundrels!” exclaimed Pencroft."
"“潘克洛夫，”赫伯特拉着水手的手，对他说，“我们可以再造一艘新的‘乘风破浪号’——比以前那艘更大的。我们有所有的铁器，双桅船上面的整套锁具都可以拿来随便用。”","“Pencroft,” said Herbert, taking the sailor’s hand, “we will build another ‘Bonadventure’—a larger one.We have all the ironwork—all the rigging of the brig at our disposal.”"
"“可是，你知道吗，”潘克洛夫说，“想要建一艘三四十吨的船，至少要花上五六个月呢！”","“But do you know,” returned Pencroft, “that it will take at least five or six months to build a vessel of from thirty to forty tons?”"
"“我们可以充分利用时间，”通讯记者说，“看来我们必须放弃今年去达抱岛的念头了。”","“We can take our time,” said the reporter, “and we must give up the voyage to Tabor Island for this year.”"
"“唉，我的‘乘风破浪号’！我可怜的‘乘风破浪号’！”潘克洛夫得知他一向引以为豪的船被毁了，他的心几乎要碎了。","“Oh, my ‘Bonadventure!’ my poor ‘Bonadventure!’” cried Pencroft, almost broken-hearted at the destruction of the vessel of which he was so proud."
"对于移民们来说，失去“乘风破浪号”的确是一件值得惋惜的事情。他们都觉得应该尽快弥补这一损失。这个问题决定之后，他们现在开始搜索这个岛上最隐蔽的地方了。","The loss of the “Bonadventure” was certainly a thing to be lamented by the colonists, and it was agreed that this loss should be repaired as soon as possible.This settled, they now occupied themselves with bringing their researches to bear on the most secret parts of the island."
"2月19号破晓时分，他们出发去探险，前后一共经历了一个星期。山麓的支脉和无数的分支使整个山区地带形成了错综复杂的谷地和丘陵。显然峡谷的深处，甚至也许连富兰克林山的内部也包括在内，都是他们要搜索的区域。如果有人想在这个岛上找到一个别人发现不了的住处，没有比这里更合适的地方了。这些山谷的地形实在是太复杂了，赛勒斯·哈丁只好严格地按顺序搜查。","The exploration was commenced at daybreak on the 19th of February, and lasted an entire week.The base of the mountain, with its spurs and their numberless ramifications, formed a labyrinth of valleys and elevations.It was evident that there, in the depths of these narrow gorges, perhaps even in the interior of Mount Franklin itself, was the proper place to pursue their researches.No part of the island could have been more suitable to conceal a dwelling whose occupant wished to remain unknown.But so irregular was the formation of the valleys that Cyrus Harding was obliged to conduct the exploration in a strictly methodical manner."
"移民们首先到了通向火山南部的山谷，瀑布河一开始就是从这里流过的。艾尔顿把大家带到了罪犯们藏身的山洞，在没有回到畜栏之前，他就是在这里被监禁的。山洞还是和艾尔顿离开的时候一样。他们发现那里有不少的火药和粮食，都是罪犯们从别的地方搬来然后储藏在这里的。","The colonists first visited the valley opening to the south of the volcano, and which first received the waters of Falls River.There Ayrton showed them the cavern where the convicts had taken refuge, and in which he had been imprisoned until his removal to the corral.This cavern was just as Ayrton had left it.They found there a considerable quantity of ammunition and provisions, conveyed thither by the convicts in order to form a reserve."
"整个山谷位于山洞旁边，被枞树和其他的树木覆盖着。他们全都搜了一遍，走过西南支脉的拐角处，移民们进入了一条细长的峡谷，这里的景致和分布着奇形怪状的玄武石柱的海岸十分接近。这里树木稀疏，乱石取代了荒草。山羊和魔弗仑羊在岩石间跳跃。从这里开始就是岛上荒芜的区域了。虽然富兰克林山麓向各处分散出了很多的山谷，但是可以看得出，这里的峡谷和畜栏那里的山谷一样，遍布着树木和牧草的只有三座。畜栏的山谷西面是瀑布河河谷，东面是红河河谷。这两股溪流由附近山里的泉水汇合而成，滋润了山南一带肥沃的土地。细水流到下游之后，和许多支流汇聚在一起形成了河流。慈悲河则是由啄木鸟林中充足的泉水直接汇合形成的，这种泉水流向各处，形成无数溪流，浇灌了盘蛇半岛上的土地。","The whole of the valley bordering on the cave, shaded by fir and other trees, was thoroughly explored, and on turning the point of the southwestern spur, the colonists entered a narrower gorge similar to the picturesque columns of basalt on the coast.Here the trees were fewer.Stones took the place of grass.Goats and musmons gambolled among the rocks.Here began the barren part of the island.It could already be seen that, of the numerous valleys branching off at the base of Mount Franklin, three only were wooded and rich in pasturage like that of the corral, which bordered on the west on the Falls River valley, and on the east on the Red Creek valley.These two streams, which lower down became rivers by the absorption of several tributaries, were formed by all the springs of the mountain and thus caused the fertility of its southern part.As to the Mercy, it was more directly fed from ample springs concealed under the cover of Jacamar Wood, and it was by springs of this nature, spreading in a thousand streamlets, that the soil of the Serpentine Peninsula was watered."
"眼下，这三条水量充足的河谷，哪一条都有可能成为独居者的藏身之处，因为生活必须的一切在这里应有尽有。移民们将它们都搜查了一遍，可是没有发现任何地方有人的存在。","Now, of these three well-watered valleys, either might have served as a retreat to some solitary who would have found there everything necessary for life.But the settlers had already explored them, and in no part had they discovered the presence of man."
"这位独居者和他的住所会不会在那些荒芜的峡谷深处、乱石丛中、北部崎岖的溪谷里或是熔岩流经的地方呢？","Was it then in the depths of those barren gorges, in the midst of the piles of rock, in the rugged northern ravines, among the streams of lava, that this dwelling and its occupant would be found?"
"富兰克林山的北部有两条很宽阔却不是很深的山谷，里面没有任何植被，只有铺在谷底的熔岩和零乱散布的各种岩石，包括火山岩石和大块矿石。这一地区需要长时间的仔细搜查。这里有上千个山洞，虽然不适合居住，但是非常隐蔽，很难进入。","The northern part of Mount Franklin was at its base composed solely of two valleys, wide, not very deep, without any appearance of vegetation, strewn with masses of rock, paved with lava, and varied with great blocks of mineral.This region required a long and careful exploration.It contained a thousand cavities, comfortless no doubt, but perfectly concealed and difficult of access."
"移民们甚至进入那些可以追溯到火山爆发时期的黑暗的地道，一直走到深山里。地道里面还有火焰熏黑的痕迹。他们摇晃着火把，穿过黑暗的走廊，连最小的洞隙处都不放过。他们还查看了那些不是很深的地道，但里面一片黑暗和寂静。这些古老的地道看来从没有人走过，这里的石块也没有人移动过——它们都保持着荒岛在海底时火山把它们喷射出水面时的样子。","The colonists even visited dark tunnels, dating from the volcanic period, still black from the passage of the fire, and penetrated into the depths of the mountain.They traversed these somber galleries, waving lighted torches; they examined the smallest excavations; they sounded the shallowest depths, but all was dark and silent.It did not appear that the foot of man had ever before trodden these ancient passages, or that his arm had ever displaced one of these blocks, which remained as the volcano had cast them up above the waters, at the time of the submersion of the island."
"然而，虽然这些地道看上去非常荒凉和阴暗，赛勒斯·哈丁必须承认这里并不是一点声音都没有。","However, although these passages appeared to be absolutely deserted, and the obscurity was complete, Cyrus Harding was obliged to confess that absolute silence did not reign there."
"他们到达一个足有几百英尺深的、直通深山内部的阴暗洞底时，工程师被一个低沉的隆隆声吓了一跳，由于有岩石的回响，声音变得更大了。","On arriving at the end of one of these gloomy caverns, extending several hundred feet into the interior of the mountain, he was surprised to hear a deep rumbling noise, increased in intensity by the sonorousness of the rocks."
"陪同他的吉迪恩·史佩莱也听到了远处传来的隆隆声，这说明地下的火复燃了。他们俩听了很久，都认为地底下正在发生着某些化学变化。","Gideon Spilett, who accompanied him, also heard these distant mutterings, which indicated a revivification of the subterranean fires.Several times both listened, and they agreed that some chemical process was taking place in the bowels of the earth."
"“这么说火山没有完全熄灭？”通讯记者问。","“Then the volcano is not totally extinct?” said the reporter."
"“可能在我们上次探索火山口之后，”赛勒斯·哈丁说，“发生了一些变化。任何一座被认为已经熄灭的火山，都可能再次大规模爆发的。”","“It is possible that since our exploration of the crater,” replied Cyrus Harding, “some change has occurred.Any volcano, although considered extinct, may evidently again burst forth.”"
"“可是，如果富兰克林山再次爆发，”史佩莱问，“林肯岛会不会有什么危险呢？”","“But if an eruption of Mount Franklin occurred,” asked Spilett, “would there not be some danger to Lincoln Island?”"
"“我想不会的，”通讯记者回答说，“火山口好比安全阀，它的存在就使得烟和岩浆从这里喷出来，就像之前那样，从这条出口出去。”","“I do not think so,” answered the reporter.“The crater, that is to say, the safety-valve, exists, and the overflow of smoke and lava, would escape, as it did formerly, by this customary outlet.”"
"“除非岩浆朝着岛上富饶的地区又冲出一条新的路！”","“Unless the lava opened a new way for itself towards the fertile parts of the island!”"
"“亲爱的史佩莱，”赛勒斯·哈丁说，“为什么它不会沿着原来的路呢？”","“And why, my dear Spilett,” answered Cyrus Harding, “should it not follow the road naturally traced out for it?”"
"“火山的性子是反复无常的。”通讯记者说。","“Well, volcanoes are capricious,” returned the reporter."
"“注意，”工程师说，“富兰克林山的斜度使水朝我们现在探索的山谷里留。要想改变水流的方向，必须发生一次地震来改变山的重心。”","“Notice,” answered the engineer, “that the inclination of Mount Franklin favors the flow of water towards the valleys which we are exploring just now.To turn aside this flow, an earthquake would be necessary to change the mountain’s center of gravity.”"
"“可是目前恐怕随时都有可能发生地震。”吉迪恩·史佩莱说。","“But an earthquake is always to be feared at these times,” observed Gideon Spilett."
"“随时，”工程师说，“特别是当地下的力量停歇了很长一段时间，刚开始复活，可能遇到一些障碍。所以，亲爱的史佩莱，火山爆发对我们来说是件很严重的事情，最好它还是不要让它产生复活的念头。但是我们不能阻止它，是不是？万一它真的爆发了，我想眺望岗也不会遭到太严重的威胁。眺望岗和富兰克林山之间的地势很低，如果岩浆朝湖水的方向流过来，它一定会落在沙丘和鲨鱼湾附近的地带的。”","“Always,” replied the engineer, “especially when the subterranean forces begin to awake, as they risk meeting with some obstruction, after a long rest.Thus, my dear Spilett, an eruption would be a serious thing for us, and it would be better that the volcano should not have the slightest desire to wake up.But we could not prevent it, could we?At any rate, even if it should occur, I do not think Prospect Heights would he seriously threatened.Between them and the mountain, the ground is considerably depressed, and if the lava should ever take a course towards the lake, it would be cast on the downs and the neighboring parts of Shark Gulf.”"
"“我们还没看见山顶上有预示着火山要喷发的烟呢。”吉迪恩·史佩莱说。","“We have not yet seen any smoke at the top of the mountain, to indicate an approaching eruption,” said Gideon Spilett."
"“没错，”哈丁说，“火山口连一丝烟雾都没有冒出来，我昨天刚刚仔细地看过山顶了。但是随着时间的推移，喷火口下部可能会堆积一些岩石、岩烬和凝结了的熔岩，它们随时都可能把我刚才所说的阀门堵住。可是，经过第一次猛烈的爆发之后，所有的障碍都排出了，我向你保证，亲爱的史佩莱，无论是好比锅炉的我们的荒岛，还是好比烟囱的火山，都不会因为气体的压力而爆炸的。不过，我还是要重复一遍，火山最好还是不要爆发。”","“No,” answered Harding, “not a vapor escapes from the crater, for it was only yesterday that I attentively surveyed the summit.But it is probable that at the lower part of the chimney, time may have accumulated rocks, cinders, hardened lava, and that this valve of which I spoke, may at any time become overcharged.But at the first serious effort, every obstacle will disappear, and you may be certain, my dear Spilett, that neither the island, which is the boiler, nor the volcano, which is the chimney, will burst under the pressure of gas.Nevertheless, I repeat, it would be better that there should not be an eruption.”"
"“可是我们没有听错啊，”通讯记者说，“火山的内部确实传来了隆隆声！”","“And yet we are not mistaken,” remarked the reporter.“Mutterings can be distinctly heard in the very bowels of the volcano!”"
"“你说得没错，”工程师说着又仔细地听了听，“这是毫无疑问的。里面正发生着骚动。我们既不能估计它的力量，又无法推测它带来的后果。”","“You are right,” said the engineer, again listening attentively.“There can be no doubt of it.A commotion is going on there, of which we can neither estimate the importance nor the ultimate result.”"
"赛勒斯·哈丁和吉迪恩·史佩莱从地道出来，和同伴们会合之后，把这些情况告诉了他们。","Cyrus Harding and Spilett, on coming out, rejoined their companions, to whom they made known the state of affairs."
"“很好！”潘克洛夫说，“火山想作怪了！要是它乐意，就让它试试吧！会有人来制服它的！”","“Very well!” cried Pencroft, “The volcano wants to play his pranks!Let him try, if he likes!He will find his master!”"
"“谁？”纳布问。","“Who?” asked Neb."
"“我们那位好心肠的天才，纳布，我们那位好心肠的天才一定会把火山的嘴堵起来，如果它敢张嘴的话！”","“Our good genius, Neb, our good genius, who will shut his mouth for him, if he so much as pretends to open it!”"
"可以看得出，水手对这位荒岛的守护神有绝对的信心。到现在为止，这种神秘的力量已经发挥了很多次了，而且每一次都是通过一种莫名其妙的方式表现出来。确实，他的力量似乎不受任何限制。另外，他还懂得怎样避开移民们最仔细的搜查，尽管他们费尽了心机，尽管他们对于这次探索的热情已经到了执着的程度，他们还是没法找到这个神秘人物的住处。","As may be seen, the sailor’s confidence in the tutelary deity of his island was absolute, and, certainly, the occult power, manifested until now in so many inexplicable ways, appeared to be unlimited; but also it knew how to escape the colonists’ most minute researches, for, in spite of all their efforts, in spite of the more than zeal,—the obstinacy,—with which they carried on their exploration, the retreat of the mysterious being could not be discovered."
"从2月19号到2月20号，他们搜查了林肯岛的整个北部地区，连最隐蔽的角落也没有放过。移民们甚至把每块岩石都敲打了一遍。他们的搜查一直延伸到山的边缘。他们来到削平了的火山锥顶，也就是第一排岩石的终点处，然后又来到上面巨大的帽子形状的山脊上，底下就是火山口。","From the 19th to the 20th of February the circle of investigation was extended to all the northern region of Lincoln Island, whose most secret nooks were explored.The colonists even went the length of tapping every rock.The search was extended to the extreme verge of the mountain.It was explored thus to the very summit of the truncated cone terminating the first row of rocks, then to the upper ridge of the enormous hat, at the bottom of which opened the crater."
"他们不仅仅做了这些。他们还搜查了深渊处，那里已经没有火了，但在它的深处却传来了清晰的隆隆声。然而，没有任何迹象表明火山将要爆发——既没有烟雾，岩石也不烫。不管是在那里，还是在富兰克林山的其他地方，移民们都没有发现任何他们要找的那个人的踪迹。","They did more; they visited the gulf, now extinct, but in whose depths the rumbling could be distinctly heard.However, no sign of smoke or vapor, no heating of the rock, indicated an approaching eruption.But neither there, nor in any other part of Mount Franklin, did the colonists find any traces of him of whom they were in search."
"他们搜查的下一站是沙丘。尽管想要到达鲨鱼湾的平地极其困难，他们还是从下到上、仔仔细细地检查了高耸的海湾里的熔岩峭壁。没有人！什么都没有！","Their investigations were then directed to the downs.They carefully examined the high lava-cliffs of Shark Gulf from the base to the crest, although it was extremely difficult to reach even the level of the gulf.No one!—nothing!"
"总之，这两句话概括了他们的白费力气和徒劳无功，说明了赛勒斯·哈丁和他的同伴们失望至极，甚至有点恼怒了。","Indeed, in these three words was summed up so much fatigue uselessly expended, so much energy producing no results, that somewhat of anger mingled with the discomfiture of Cyrus Harding and his companions."
"现在是时候考虑往回走了，因为这种搜索是不能无限期地拖延下去的。移民们都十分肯定地认为这个神秘的人并不住在荒岛的表面上，于是他们的脑海中出现了各种各样的大胆想象。特别是潘克洛夫和纳布，他们认为这件事情不仅神秘，而且让他们想到了超脱凡人的境界。","It was now time to think of returning, for these researches could not be prolonged indefinitely.The colonists were certainly right in believing that the mysterious being did not reside on the surface of the island, and the wildest fancies haunted their excited imaginations.Pencroft and Neb, particularly, were not contented with the mystery, but allowed their imaginations to wander into the domain of the supernatural."
"2月25号，移民们回到了花岗石宫。他们用双股的绳索把弓箭射到了门槛上，重新建立了住宅和地面之间的联系。","On the 25th of February the colonists re-entered Granite House, and by means of the double cord, carried by an arrow to the threshold of the door, they re-established communication between their habitation and the ground."
"一个月之后，也就是3月25号，是他们来到林肯岛的三周年纪念日。","A month later they commemorated, on the 25th of March, the third anniversary of their arrival on Lincoln Island."
"第十四章","Chapter 14"
"他们已经从里士满逃出来三年了。在这三年里，他们曾无数次地谈到过心中念念不忘的祖国！","Three years had passed away since the escape of the prisoners from Richmond, and how often during those three years had they spoken of their country, always present in their thoughts!"
"他们深信内战已经结束了，对于他们来说，北军的正义事业是不可能不获得胜利的。但是，这场可怕的战争中都发生过什么事情呢？有多少人为此付出了血的代价？他们的朋友中有多少在这场战争中牺牲了性命？他们经常谈起这些问题，但是目前他们还不能预知何时才能被允许重新回到祖国。要是能回去一趟，哪怕仅仅是几天也好，再和有人居住的世界恢复社交联系，在故乡和林肯岛之间建立交通，然后在这个他们发现的小岛上度过他们一生中最长、也许是最幸福的时光（而这一切都取决于他们的祖国），这难道真的是一个不可能实现的理想吗？","They had no doubt that the civil war was at an end, and to them it appeared impossible that the just cause of the North had not triumphed.But what had been the incidents of this terrible war?How much blood had it not cost?How many of their friends must have fallen in the struggle?They often spoke of these things, without as yet being able to foresee the day when they would be permitted once more to see their country.To return thither, were it but for a few days, to renew the social link with the inhabited world, to establish a communication between their native land and their island, then to pass the longest, perhaps the best, portion of their existence in this colony, founded by them, and which would then be dependent on their country, was this a dream impossible to realize?"
"要实现这个理想，只有两种途径：要么有船到林肯岛附近来，要么移民们自己造一艘坚固的船，能够航行到离他们最近的陆地上。","There were only two ways of accomplishing it—either a ship must appear off Lincoln Island, or the colonists must themselves build a vessel strong enough to sail to the nearest land."
"“只有等我们那位好心肠的天才为我们提供回到祖国的工具了。”潘克洛夫说。","“Unless,” said Pencroft, “our good genius, himself provides us with the means of returning to our country.”"
"的确，即使现在有人告诉潘克洛夫和纳布，有一艘三百吨重的大船在鲨鱼湾或者气球港等着他们，他们也丝毫不会感到奇怪。在他们的脑子里，似乎没有什么事情是不可能发生的。","And, really, had any one told Pencroft and Neb that a ship of 300 tons was waiting for them in Shark Gulf or at Port Balloon, they would not even have made a gesture of surprise.In their state of mind nothing appeared improbable."
"可是赛勒斯·哈丁却不那么有信心，他劝他们面对现实，特别是在造船的问题上，更要现实一点，这确实是一件十分紧急的任务，因为他们要尽快把写明艾尔顿的新地址的信件送到达抱岛上去。","But Cyrus Harding, less confident, advised them to confine themselves to fact, and more especially so with regard to the building of a vessel—a really urgent work, since it was for the purpose of depositing, as soon as possible, at Tabor Island a document indicating Ayrton’s new residence."
"“乘风破浪号”已经不复存在了，造一艘新船至少要六个月的时间。现在冬天就要来了，在下一年春天到来之前，他们不能航海。","As the “Bonadventure” no longer existed, six months at least would be required for the construction of a new vessel.Now winter was approaching, and the voyage would not be made before the following spring."
"“在天气转暖之前我们有足够的时间把一切都准备好。”工程师在和潘克洛夫商量这些问题的时候说，“我觉得吧，朋友，既然我们不得不重新造一艘船，最好还是造得大一点儿。我们不能确定苏格兰游船有没有到达抱岛。可能在几个月之前，它到过那里，没有发现艾尔顿的踪迹又离开了那里。最好能造一艘大船，在必要的时候，我们就能乘着它到波利尼西亚群岛或新西兰，这样做不好吗？你觉得怎么样？”","“We have time to get everything ready for the fine season,” remarked the engineer, who was consulting with Pencroft about these matters.“I think, therefore, my friend, that since we have to rebuild our vessel it will be best to give her larger dimensions.The arrival of the Scotch yacht at Tabor Island is very uncertain.It may even be that, having arrived several months ago, she has again sailed after having vainly searched for some trace of Ayrton.Will it not then he best to build a ship which, if necessary, could take us either to the Polynesian Archipelago or to New Zealand?What do you think?”"
"“队长，”水手说，“我觉得无论大船还是小船都能造。木材和工具都不少，只是时间的问题。”","“I think, captain,” answered the sailor; “I think that you are as capable of building a large vessel as a small one.Neither the wood nor the tools are wanting.It is only a question of time.”"
"“造一艘250到300吨的船要几个月？”哈丁问道。","“And how many months would be required to build a vessel of from 250 to 300 tons?” asked Harding."
"“至少七八个月，”潘克洛夫答道，“而且别忘了，冬天快到了，在严寒的时候很难做木工活。我们必须为可能出现的拖延多算出几个星期的时间。如果能在下个十一月之前把船造好，我们就很幸运了。”","“Seven or eight months at least,” replied Pencroft.“But it must not be forgotten that winter is drawing near, and that in severe frost wood is difficult to work.We must calculate on several weeks delay, and if our vessel is ready by next November we may think ourselves very lucky.”"
"“好，”赛勒斯·哈丁说，“到那时正是航海的好时候，无论是去达抱岛，还是去更远的地方，那个季节对任何航行都是适合的。”","“Well,” replied Cyrus Harding, “that will be exactly the most favorable time for undertaking a voyage of any importance, either to Tabor Island or to a more distant land.”"
"“那就这么定了吧，队长，”水手说，“你去设计图样，工人时刻准备开工。我想艾尔顿可以成为一个得力的助手。”","“So it will, captain,” answered the sailor.“Make out your plans then; the workmen are ready, and I imagine that Ayrton can lend us a good helping hand.”"
"移民们商量了之后，通过了工程师的方案，的确，这是最好的办法了。造一艘二三百吨的船确实需要花费很大的劳力，但是此前的成功经验让移民们充满了信心。","The colonists, having been consulted, approved the engineer’s plan, and it was, indeed, the best thing to be done.It is true that the construction of a ship of from two to three hundred tons would be great labor, but the colonists had confidence in themselves, justified by their previous success."
"于是赛勒斯·哈丁着手设计船的图样，制作船的模型。在这段时间里，他的同伴们去砍伐树木，把木材运来做肋材、船骨和铺板。远西森林里有最好的橡树和榆树。他们在上次远征时打开的通道的基础上开辟出一条可以通行的道路，并把它称作远西路。木材都被运到了“石窟”里，造船厂就设在那儿。由于开辟这条路的时候，需要选择树木，所以道路曲曲弯弯，不过这样一来，也方便了他们去盘蛇半岛的大部分地区。","Cyrus Harding then busied himself in drawing the plan of the vessel and making the model.During this time his companions employed themselves in felling and carting trees to furnish the ribs, timbers, and planks.The forest of the Far West supplied the best oaks and elms.They took advantage of the opening already made on their last excursion to form a practicable road, which they named the Far West Road, and the trees were carried to the Chimneys, where the dockyard was established.As to the road in question, the choice of trees had rendered its direction somewhat capricious, but at the same time it facilitated the access to a large part of the Serpentine Peninsula."
"有一点非常重要，他们必须加快伐树和锯木料的进度，因为湿木料是不能用的，而要使它们干燥需要一段时间。因此，木工们在整个四月都忙得不可开交，只有春分刮大风的时候受到了一些影响。贾普动作灵活，给他们很多帮助，它一会儿上树系绳子，一会儿用它结实的肩膀搬运砍下来的树干。","It was important that the trees should be quickly felled and cut up, for they could not be used while yet green, and some time was necessary to allow them to get seasoned.The carpenters, therefore, worked vigorously during the month of April, which was troubled only by a few equinoctial gales of some violence.Master Jup aided them dexterously, either by climbing to the top of a tree to fasten the ropes or by lending his stout shoulders to carry the lopped trunks."
"他们把所有木材都堆在了“石窟”旁边的大棚子里以留用。","All this timber was piled up under a large shed, built near the Chimneys, and there awaited the time for use."
"四月份的天气相当晴朗，和北半球的十月差不多。与此同时，他们也在积极地进行着其他工作。不久之后，眺望岗的高地上连一丝被破坏过的痕迹都没有了。磨坊已经重新建好了，家禽场里也盖起了新的建筑。因为禽类的数量大幅度增加，他们必须扩大这些建筑。现在厩房里有五只野驴，除了一只小驴外，其他四只已经被训练得很好，既肯拉车，又肯让人骑。移民们现在有一张犁，两只野驴常常像约克州和肯特基州的耕牛一样拉犁。移民们分工协作，不知疲惫。还有谁能比他们更健康呢？他们为未来提出上千条计划时，花岗石宫的夜晚活跃着怎样的欢乐啊！","The month of April was tolerably fine, as October often is in the northern zone.At the same time other work was actively continued, and soon all trace of devastation disappeared from the plateau of Prospect Heights.The mill was rebuilt, and new buildings rose in the poultry-yard.It had appeared necessary to enlarge their dimensions, for the feathered population had increased considerably.The stable now contained five onagers, four of which were well broken, and allowed themselves to be either driven or ridden, and a little colt.The colony now possessed a plow, to which the onagers were yoked like regular Yorkshire or Kentucky oxen.The colonists divided their work, and their arms never tired.Then who could have enjoyed better health than these workers, and what good humor enlivened the evenings in Granite House as they formed a thousand plans for the future!"
"现在艾尔顿和大家无论哪方面都步调一致，再也不提他回畜栏去住的话了。但是他还是很伤心，话也很少，虽然经常和同伴们一起工作，却不像大家那么开心。但是在紧急情况时，他却是一个难得的工人——强壮、熟练、灵巧、聪明。每个人都很尊重他、爱护他，这一点他不可能感觉不到。","As a matter of course Ayrton shared the common lot in every respect, and there was no longer any talk of his going to live at the corral.Nevertheless he was still sad and reserved, and joined more in the work than in the pleasures of his companions.But he was a valuable workman at need—strong, skilful, ingenious, intelligent.He was esteemed and loved by all, and he could not be ignorant of it."
"在这期间，他们并没有对畜栏置之不理。每隔一天，他们之中的一个人都会驾车或骑驴去那里照看摩弗仑羊和山羊并带回纳布需要的羊奶。一路上还有机会打猎。因此，比起其他人，到畜栏去得最勤的是赫伯特和吉迪恩·史佩莱，他们带着上好的猎枪，由托普在前面带路。花岗石宫里也因此从没有断过野味，大的有水豚、刺鼠、袋鼠和野猪，小的有野鸭、山鸡、松鸡、啄木鸟和鹬。养兔场和蛤蜊场的产品、捉来的海龟、游到慈悲河的美味的鲑鱼、高地上的蔬菜和森林里的野果，各种食物极其丰盛，主厨纳布一个人几乎都保管不过来了。","In the meanwhile the corral was not abandoned.Every other day one of the settlers, driving the cart or mounted on an onager, went to look after the flock of musmons and goats and bring back the supply of milk required by Neb.These excursions at the same time afforded opportunities for hunting.Therefore Herbert and Gideon Spilett, with Top in front, traversed more often than their companions the road to the corral, and with the capital guns which they carried, capybaras, agouties, kangaroos, and wild pigs for large game, ducks, grouse, jacamars, and snipe for small game, were never wanting in the house.The produce of the warren, of the oyster-bed, several turtles which were taken, excellent salmon which came up the Mercy, vegetables from the plateau, wild fruit from the forest, were riches upon riches, and Neb, the head cook, could scarcely by himself store them away."
"当然，畜栏和花岗石宫之间的电报线已经修好了，如果有人去了畜栏后必须留在那里过夜，就会通过电报取得联系。此外，现在岛上已经安全了，他们至少不必担心受到人类的袭击了。","The telegraphic wire between the corral and Granite House had of course been repaired, and it was worked whenever one or other of the settlers was at the corral and found it necessary to spend the night there.Besides, the island was safe now and no attacks were to be feared, at any rate from men."
"然而，发生过的事情有可能会再次发生。他们要经常提防着有海盗或是逃犯流窜到这里。有可能鲍勃·哈维的同伴或党羽知道他的秘密计划，他们可能会受到诱惑想要效仿他。因此，移民们仔细地观察荒岛附近的海面，每天都用望远镜瞭望联合湾和华盛顿湾之间的海面。他们去畜栏的时候，也会检查西边的海面，不敢有丝毫怠慢。他们还会爬到支脉上，这样就可以看到西边海平面的绝大部分了。","However, that which had happened might happen again.A descent of pirates, or even of escaped convicts, was always to be feared.It was possible that companions or accomplices of Bob Harvey had been in the secret of his plans, and might be tempted to imitate him.The colonists, therefore, were careful to observe the sea around the island, and every day their telescope covered the horizon enclosed by Union and Washington Bays. when they went to the corral they examined the sea to the west with no less attention, and by climbing the spur their gaze extended over a large section of the western horizon."
"他们没有发现任何可疑的东西，但是小心防备还是很有必要的。","Nothing suspicious was discerned, but still it was necessary for them to be on their guard."
"一天晚上，工程师向他的同伴们宣布了为畜栏修筑防御工事所构思的计划。为了谨慎起见，他认为应该加高栅栏并在侧面建一个木屋，在必要的时候，移民们可以用它来防御敌人。因为拥有极好的位置条件，可以说花岗石宫是坚不可摧的；因此，不管是什么样的海盗，只要他们一登陆，一准儿会把畜栏和那里的建筑物、贮藏物资和牲畜当作目标。如果移民们不得已被困在里面，他们也能够保护自己不受任何威胁。这是一个值得考虑的计划，但是他们要等到转年春天才能实行这个计划。","The engineer one evening imparted to his friends a plan which he had conceived for fortifying the corral.It appeared prudent to him to heighten the palisade and to flank it with a sort of blockhouse, which, if necessary, the settlers could hold against the enemy.Granite House might, by its very position, be considered impregnable; therefore the corral with its buildings, its stores, and the animals it contained, would always be the object of pirates, whoever they were, who might land on the island, and should the colonists be obliged to shut themselves up there they ought also to be able to defend themselves without any disadvantage.This was a project which might be left for consideration, and they were, besides, obliged to put off its execution until the next spring."
"5月15号前后，他们把新船的龙骨造好了，放在造船所里；不久之后，船首材和船尾材也已经用榫头分别接在了龙骨的两头，几乎垂直地立了起来。用优质的橡木制成的长达110英尺的龙骨上面可以架一根宽25英尺的船中央横梁。但是，在严寒和恶劣天气到来之前，木匠们能做的也只有这些了。接下来的一周里，他们装好了第一批船尾的肋材，然后就不得不暂时停止工作。","About the 15th of May the keel of the new vessel lay along the dockyard, and soon the stem and stern-post, mortised at each of its extremities, rose almost perpendicularly.The keel, of good oak, measured 110 feet in length, this allowing a width of five-and-twenty feet to the midship beam.But this was all the carpenters could do before the arrival of the frosts and bad weather.During the following week they fixed the first of the stern timbers, but were then obliged to suspend work."
"在这个月的最后几天，天气已经变得非常糟糕了。大风从东面吹来，有时像暴风一样猛烈。工程师有些担心造船所的棚子，可是，他却不能把它盖在花岗石宫周围的其他地方，因为小岛不能完全挡住冲向海岸的疯狂的海水，在暴风雨猛烈的时候，波涛甚至会一直冲到花岗石壁的脚下。","During the last days of the month the weather was extremely bad.The wind blew from the east, sometimes with the violence of a tempest.The engineer was somewhat uneasy on account of the dockyard shed—which besides, he could not have established in any other place near to Granite House—for the islet only imperfectly sheltered the shore from the fury of the open sea, and in great storms the waves beat against the very foot of the granite cliff."
"所幸这些顾虑并没有成为现实。大风转向了东南方向，遗物角把整个花岗石宫的海滩遮挡起来。","But, very fortunately, these fears were not realized.The wind shifted to the southeast, and there the beach of Granite House was completely covered by Flotsam Point."
"参加造船工作的人中，潘克洛夫和艾尔顿是最有热情的，他们总是尽可能地坚持工作。他们不介意狂风吹过头顶，也不在乎暴雨淋湿身体，不管天气好坏，他们总是抡起锤子干活。但是，这场雨过后紧跟着就是一阵严寒，木头的纤维变得像铁一样坚硬，加工起来非常困难。6月10号前后，造船的工作不得不全部暂停了。","Pencroft and Ayrton, the most zealous workmen at the new vessel, pursued their labor as long as they could.They were not men to mind the wind tearing at their hair, nor the rain wetting them to the skin, and a blow from a hammer is worth just as much in bad as in fine weather.But when a severe frost succeeded this wet period, the wood, its fibers acquiring the hardness of iron, became extremely difficult to work, and about the 10th of June shipbuilding was obliged to be entirely discontinued."
"赛勒斯·哈丁和他的同伴们都不能忽略的是，林肯岛上的冬季特别寒冷。寒冷的程度可以和新英格兰各州相比，这几个州和林肯岛几乎处于同一纬度。在北半球，至少是在美洲的英国属地和美国北部地区，这种现象可以解释为北极附近地势平坦，没有突起的地方阻挡北风；但是在林肯岛，这个理由就不充分了。","Cyrus Harding and his companions had not omitted to observe how severe was the temperature during the winters of Lincoln Island.The cold was comparable to that experienced in the States of New England, situated at almost the same distance from the equator.In the northern hemisphere, or at any rate in the part occupied by British America and the north of the United States, this phenomenon is explained by the flat conformation of the territories bordering on the pole, and on which there is no intumescence of the soil to oppose any obstacle to the north winds; here, in Lincoln Island, this explanation would not suffice."
"“人们甚至已经注意到，”有一天哈丁对他的同伴们说，“纬度相同的岛屿和沿海地区不会像内陆那么冷。比如，我经常听说，伦巴第的冬天并不比苏格兰的冬天暖和，这是因为在冬天的时候苏格兰附近的海洋会把在夏天吸收的热量散发出来。岛屿得益于这种影响，所以情况往往会好一些。”","“It has even been observed,” remarked Harding one day to his companions, “that in equal latitudes the islands and coast regions are less tried by the cold than inland countries.I have often heard it asserted that the winters of Lombardy, for example, are not less rigorous than those of Scotland, which results from the sea restoring during the winter the heat which it received during the summer.Islands are, therefore, in a better situation for benefiting by this restitution.”"
"“那么，哈丁队长，”赫伯特问，“为什么林肯岛不符合一般规律呢？”","“But then, Captain Harding,” asked Herbert, “why does Lincoln Island appear to escape the common law?”"
"“这很难解释，”工程师回答道，“不过，我猜想这是由于林肯岛位于南半球造成的。孩子，你知道的，南半球比北半球要冷。”","“That is difficult to explain,” answered the engineer.“However, I should be disposed to conjecture that this peculiarity results from the situation of the island in the Southern Hemisphere, which, as you know, my boy, is colder than the Northern Hemisphere.”"
"“是的，”赫伯特说，“南太平洋的冰山与北太平洋相比，出现在纬度较低的地方。”","“Yes,” said Herbert, “and icebergs are met with in lower latitudes in the south than in the north of the Pacific.”"
"“没错，”潘克洛夫说，“我在捕鲸船上当水手的时候，就曾经在合恩角看见过冰山。”","“That is true,” remarked Pencroft, “and when I have been serving on board whalers I have seen icebergs off Cape Horn.”"
"“林肯岛上这么冷，”吉迪恩·史佩莱说，“也许就是因为附近不远的地方有浮冰或是冰山吧。”","“The severe cold experienced in Lincoln Island,” said Gideon Spilett, “may then perhaps be explained by the presence of floes or icebergs comparatively near to Lincoln Island.”"
"“你的想法确实很有道理，亲爱的史佩莱，”赛勒斯·哈丁说，“很显然这里的冬天这么冷是因为我们靠近冰山。我还要请你们注意一个完全属于物理上的原因，它同样可以解释为什么南半球要比北半球冷。事实上，夏季的时候，太阳距离南半球比较近，因此在冬季自然就要远一些。这就解释了为什么冬夏两季的温度会如此悬殊。如果我们觉得林肯岛上的冬天特别冷，反过来我们也不要忘了，这里的夏天特别热。”","“Your opinion is very admissible indeed, my dear Spilett,” answered Cyrus Harding, “and it is evidently to the proximity of icebergs that we owe our rigorous winters.I would draw your attention also to an entirely physical cause, which renders the Southern colder than the Northern Hemisphere.In fact, since the sun is nearer to this hemisphere during the summer, it is necessarily more distant during the winter.This explains then the excess of temperature in the two seasons, for, if we find the winters very cold in Lincoln Island, we must not forget that the summers here, on the contrary, are very hot.”"
"“但是，麻烦您解释一下，队长，”潘克洛夫皱着眉头说，“为什么我们的半球气候这样悬殊呢？这不公平！”","“But why, if you please, captain,” asked Pencroft, knitting his brows, “why should our hemisphere, as you say, be so badly divided?It isn’t just, that!”"
"“潘克洛夫，”工程师笑着回答，“不管公平不公平，我们只能接受它。之所以会这样悬殊，这是因为：地球环绕太阳的轨道并不是圆形的，而是椭圆形，因为它必须符合力学定律。当地球处于椭圆形的轨道上离太阳最远的一个极点时，它就在远日点上；而另外一个离太阳最近的极点就是近日点。现在，南半球正处在冬季，是离太阳最远的时候，所以，这一带地区最为寒冷。没有任何东西可以阻止这一点。潘克洛夫，不管人类的学识有多么的丰富，也绝不能改变上帝创造的宇宙的规律。”","“Friend Pencroft,” answered the engineer, laughing, “whether just or not, we must submit to it, and here lies the reason for this peculiarity.The earth does not describe a circle around the sun, but an ellipse, as it must by the laws of rational mechanics.Now, the earth occupies one of the foci of the ellipse, and so at one point in its course is at its apogee, that is, at its farthest from the sun, and at another point it is at its perigee, or nearest to the sun.Now it happens that it is during the winter of the southern countries that it is at its most distant point from the sun, and consequently, in a situation for those regions to feel the greatest cold.Nothing can be done to prevent that, and men, Pencroft, however learned they may be, can never change anything of the cosmographical order established by God Himself.”"
"“但是，”潘克洛夫补充道，“我们已经对这个世界了解得够多的了。队长，如果要把人们所知道的一切写成一本书，这本书会有多大啊！”","“And yet,” added Pencroft, “the world is very learned. what a big book, captain, might be made with all that is known!”"
"“可是要把人们不知道的事情写成一本书，要比你说的那本大得多！”哈丁回答道。","“And what a much bigger book still with all that is not known!” answered Harding."
"不管是什么原因，最终六月份依旧还是那么寒冷，移民们只好成天呆在花岗石宫里。啊！这种被监禁的生活对于他们，特别是对吉迪恩·史佩莱来说是多么的厌烦啊！","At last, for one reason or another, the month of June brought the cold with its accustomed intensity, and the settlers were often confined to Granite House.Ah! how wearisome this imprisonment was to them, and more particularly to Gideon Spilett."
"“喂，”有一天他对纳布说，“不管你去了哪儿，如果你能大发慈悲给我订份报纸，我一定把未来的所有财产都给你，绝不反悔！真的，对我来说最开心的事情就是每天早上能知道前一天发生在各地的事情！”","“Look here,” said he to Neb one day, “I would give you by notarial deed all the estates which will come to me some day, if you were a good enough fellow to go, no matter where, and subscribe to some newspaper for me!Decidedly the thing that is most essential to my happiness is the knowing every morning what has happened the day before in other places than this!”"
"纳布笑了起来。","Neb began to laugh."
"“老实说，”他说，“我现在考虑的唯一一件事就是我的日常工作！”","“’Pon my word,” he replied, “the only thing I think about is my daily work!”"
"实际上，室内和室外都有很多工作要做。","The truth was that indoors as well as out there was no want of work."
"经过三年坚持不懈的努力工作，林肯岛上移民们的生活现在已经达到鼎盛时期。被毁坏的双桅船成了他们新的财富来源。除了可以装备正在建造中的新船的整套索具之外，各种各样的器皿和工具、武器和弹药、衣服和用具都储藏在了花岗石宫的库房里。他们甚至不需要重新生产那种十分粗糙的材料了。尽管移民们在第一个冬天里饱受严寒的折磨，但是不管现在天气多么糟糕，他们都不必害怕了。他们有许多的亚麻制品，但他们依旧很节省。赛勒斯·哈丁从氯化钠，也就是海盐中，轻而易举地提取出小苏打和氯。小苏打很容易变成碳酸钠，氯可以制成氯化钙，工程师把它们用在各种家庭用途上，特别是用它们漂白亚麻布。此外，他们和古时候的家族人员一样，一年中最多洗四次衣服。这里应该补充一点，吉迪恩·史佩莱在等待邮差给他送报纸的同时，还和潘克洛夫一道充当了洗衣工的角色。","The colony of Lincoln Island was now at its highest point of prosperity, achieved by three years of continued hard work.The destruction of the brig had been a new source of riches.Without speaking of the complete rig which would serve for the vessel now on the stocks, utensils and tools of all sorts, weapons and ammunition, clothes and instruments, were now piled in the storerooms of Granite House.It had not even been necessary to resort again to the manufacture of the coarse felt materials.Though the colonists had suffered from cold during their first winter, the bad season might now come without their having any reason to dread its severity.Linen was plentiful also, and besides, they kept it with extreme care.From chloride of sodium, which is nothing else than sea salt, Cyrus Harding easily extracted the soda and chlorine.The soda, which it was easy to change into carbonate of soda, and the chlorine, of which he made chloride of lime, were employed for various domestic purposes, and especially in bleaching linen.Besides, they did not wash more than four times a year, as was done by families in the olden times, and it may be added, that Pencroft and Gideon Spilett, while waiting for the postman to bring him his newspaper, distinguished themselves as washermen."
"冬季的六月、七月和八月就这样过去了。这几个月天气极其寒冷，温度计上显示的气温平均不到华氏8度。可见温度比去年冬天低了。但是，花岗石宫里的炉火烧得是多旺啊！花岗石壁被熏成一条条细长的条纹，像斑马身上的花纹一样。他们不用节约木柴，因为离他们几步远的地方就出产木柴。另外，在造船的时候剩下的一些碎木片使他们能够节省一些煤。相比之下，煤的运输更为困难。","So passed the winter months, June, July, and August.They were severe, and the average observations of the thermometer did not give more than eight degrees of Fahrenheit.It was therefore lower in temperature than the preceding winter.But then, what splendid fires blazed continually on the hearths of Granite House, the smoke marking the granite wall with long, zebra-like streaks!Fuel was not spared, as it grew naturally a few steps from them.Besides, the chips of the wood destined for the construction of the ship enabled them to economize the coal, which required more trouble to transport."
"人和牲畜都平安无事。必须承认，小贾普有点怕冷。这大概是它唯一的弱点，移民们很有必要给它做一件厚厚的长袍。它是一个多好的仆人啊！聪明、热心、不知疲倦、慎重、不爱说话，它完全有资格被推举为新旧世界猿猴类里的模范！","Men and animals were all well.Master Jup was a little chilly, it must be confessed.This was perhaps his only weakness, and it was necessary to make him a well-padded dressing-gown.But what a servant he was, clever, zealous, indefatigable, not indiscreet, not talkative, and he might have been with reason proposed as a model for all his biped brothers in the Old and New Worlds!"
"“说到它，”潘克洛夫说，“既然它有四只手，它当然应该把工作干得更好！”","“As for that,” said Pencroft, “when one has four hands at one’s service, of course one’s work ought to be done so much the better!”"
"实际上，这个聪明的生灵确实干得不错。","And indeed the intelligent creature did it well."
"从上次在山的附近进行搜查到现在，已经有七个月了。在这段时间里，包括气候转好的九月，他们没有听到任何关于荒岛上的天才的消息。他的力量没有通过任何方式显现出来。事实上，也不需要他发挥他的力量，因为这里没有发生过什么让移民们头痛的事情。","During the seven months which had passed since the last researches made round the mountain, and during the month of September, which brought back fine weather, nothing was heard of the genius of the island.His power was not manifested in any way.It is true that it would have been superfluous, for no incident occurred to put the colonists to any painful trial."
"赛勒斯·哈丁甚至注意到，即便陌生人真的利用花岗岩跟花岗石宫的移民取得了联系，即便托普曾经凭借直觉也感觉出这一点，但在这段时间里，却没有什么其他的迹象。托普不再咆哮了，猩猩也不再觉得不安了。这两个朋友——它们确实是朋友——既不到井口处徘徊，也不像工程师最初见到它们时那样发出奇怪的叫声和哀怨声了。但是，他能相信关于这个谜题他能了解的就只有这些，他永远也不能找到答案？他能肯定以后再也不会遇到什么事件紧急到能让这个神秘的人出现吗？有谁能预知将来发生的事情呢？","Cyrus Harding even observed that if by chance the communication between the unknown and the tenants of Granite House had ever been established through the granite, and if Top’s instinct had as it were felt it, there was no further sign of it during this period.The dog’s growling had entirely ceased, as well as the uneasiness of the orang.The two friends—for they were such—no longer prowled round the opening of the inner well, nor did they bark or whine in that singular way which from the first the engineer had noticed.But could he be sure that this was all that was to be said about this enigma, and that he should never arrive at a solution?Could he be certain that some conjuncture would not occur which would bring the mysterious personage on the scene? who could tell what the future might have in reserve?"
"严冬终于过去了。然而，在大地回春的最初几天发生了一件事，很可能会引发严重的后果。","At last the winter was ended, but an event, the consequences of which might be serious occurred in the first days of the returning spring."
"9月7号，赛勒斯·哈丁观察火山口的时候发现山顶上烟雾缭绕，第一缕蒸汽升向天空。","On the 7th of September, Cyrus Harding, having observed the crater, saw smoke curling round the summit of the mountain, its first vapors rising in the air."
"第十五章","Chapter 15"
"听到工程师的警告，移民们立即放下手里的工作，默默地注视着富兰克林山的顶峰。","The colonists, warned by the engineer, left their work and gazed in silence at the summit of Mount Franklin."
"火山复活了，蒸汽穿过火山口底部的矿物层升了起来。但是，地下的火会引起猛烈的爆炸吗？这是谁也无法预测的。不过，就算有火山爆发的可能，也不大可能整个林肯岛都要受灾。火山里流出来的熔岩并不一定都会带来灾难，而且通过山坡北面上的一条条凝结了的熔岩来判断，这个荒岛肯定已经经受过这样的考验了。此外，根据火山口的形状——它的开口位于上面的边缘地带——可以断定，熔岩应该会被喷到岛上富饶地区对面的那部分区域。","The volcano had awoke, and the vapor had penetrated the mineral layer heaped at the bottom of the crater.But would the subterranean fires provoke any violent eruption?This was an event which could not be foreseen.However, even while admitting the possibility of an eruption, it was not probable that the whole of Lincoln Island would suffer from it.The flow of volcanic matter is not always disastrous, and the island had already undergone this trial, as was shown by the streams of lava hardened on the northern slopes of the mountain.Besides, from the shape of the crater—the opening broken in the upper edge—the matter would be thrown to the side opposite the fertile regions of the island."
"然而，过去的情况不一定能够回答未来的问题。在火山的顶峰，经常会出现这样的情况，原来的火山口堵塞了，新的火山口打开了。这样的情况在南北两个半球都曾经出现过——埃得纳火山、波波卡提佩特峰和奥里萨巴火山就是这样，在火山爆发的前夕，所有的担心都不是多余的。实际上，往往伴随着火山爆发发生的地震足以改变火山的内部结构并为岩浆打开一条条新的出路。","However, the past did not necessarily answer for the future.Often, at the summit of volcanoes, the old craters close and new ones open.This had occurred in the two hemispheres—at Etna, Popocatepetl, at Orizabaand on the eve of an eruption there is everything to be feared.In fact, an earthquake—a phenomenon which often accompanies volcanic eruption—is enough to change the interior arrangement of a mountain, and to open new outlets for the burning lava."
"赛勒斯·哈丁向伙伴们解释了这些情况。他毫不夸张地向大家陈述了各种利弊。总之，无论事情怎么发展，他们都没有办法阻止。除非地面因地震发生摇动，要不然花岗石宫的安全大概不会遭到威胁。但是，如果从富兰克林山的南面开出一个新的火山口，畜栏就要面临着严重的危险了。","Cyrus Harding explained these things to his companions, and, without exaggerating the state of things, he told them all the pros and cons.After all, they could not prevent it.It did not appear likely that Granite House would be threatened unless the ground was shaken by an earthquake.But the corral would be in great danger should a new crater open in the southern side of Mount Franklin."
"从这一天开始，山顶的烟一直没有消失，移民们甚至可以看到，虽然没有夹杂着火焰，但是喷出来的烟却是越来越高，越来越浓了。特别是在中央火山口较低的地方，这种情况更为突出。","From that day the smoke never disappeared from the top of the mountain, and it could even be perceived that it increased in height and thickness, without any flame mingling in its heavy volumes.The phenomenon was still concentrated in the lower part of the central crater."
"不管怎样，随着气候逐渐好转，他们继续工作。他们尽量加快造船的进度。赛勒斯·哈丁利用岸上的瀑布，建起了一个水力锯木机，如此一来，他们很快就把树干锯成了铺板和托梁。这套装置的机械原理和挪威使用的简易锯木机一样简单。先用一个水平的机械装置移动木块，再用一个垂直的机械装置移动钢锯——这就是所有的必要部件了。工程师用一个轮子、两个滚筒和几个滑轮把它正确地装配起来。到了九月底，纵帆船的骨架已经在造船所里完成了。肋材也几乎全都完成了，全部的船骨暂时被细绳支撑着，船的轮廓大致可以看得出来了。这艘纵帆船的船头很尖，后边的部分又细又长，显然非常适合远航。但是铺板的工作还需要一段相当长的时间才能完成。好在海盗的双桅船爆炸之后，他们把上面所有的铁器都保留了下来。潘克洛夫和艾尔顿从铺板和破损的肋材上拔下一些螺丝钉和大量的铜钉。这样一来，他们就可以少做很多铁活了，但是还有很多木工活要做。","However, with the fine days work had been continued.The building of the vessel was hastened as much as possible, and, by means of the waterfall on the shore, Cyrus Harding managed to establish an hydraulic sawmill, which rapidly cut up the trunks of trees into planks and joists.The mechanism of this apparatus was as simple as those used in the rustic sawmills of Norway.A first horizontal movement to move the piece of wood, a second vertical movement to move the saw—this was all that was wanted; and the engineer succeeded by means of a wheel, two cylinders, and pulleys properly arranged.Towards the end of the month of September the skeleton of the vessel, which was to be rigged as a schooner, lay in the dockyard.The ribs were almost entirely completed, and, all the timbers having been sustained by a provisional band, the shape of the vessel could already be seen.The schooner, sharp in the bows, very slender in the after-part, would evidently be suitable for a long voyage, if wanted; but laying the planking would still take a considerable time.Very fortunately, the iron work of the pirate brig had been saved after the explosion.From the planks and injured ribs Pencroft and Ayrton had extracted the bolts and a large quantity of copper nails.It was so much work saved for the smiths, but the carpenters had much to do."
"因为要在高地上进行收割，晾晒牧草和收获不同的农作物，造船的工作暂停了一个星期。这项工作结束之后，所有的时间都用来完成纵帆船的建造。每到晚上，工人们都是筋疲力尽。为了不浪费时间，他们改变了吃饭的时间——十二点吃中午饭，天黑之后再吃晚饭。然后他们再爬上花岗石宫睡觉。","Shipbuilding was interrupted for a week for the harvest, the haymaking, and the gathering in of the different crops on the plateau.This work finished, every moment was devoted to finishing the schooner.When night came the workmen were really quite exhausted.So as not to lose any time they had changed the hours for their meals; they dined at twelve o’clock, and only had their supper when daylight failed them.They then ascended to Granite House, when they were always ready to go to bed."
"然而，有的时候他们会谈起一些有意思的话题，这就推迟了睡觉的时间。他们谈到将来，每每说到如果可以乘纵帆船到有人居住的地方可能会改变他们现在的情况，他们总是很高兴。但是，在谈论这些计划的时候，再次回到林肯岛的想法总是占上风。他们永远不会放弃这片领地，因为他们花了太多的心血成功地把它建立起来，一旦与美国取得联系，他们就可以得到新的动力。尤其是潘克洛夫和纳布，他们特别希望能够在林肯岛上过一辈子。","Sometimes, however, when the conversation bore on some interesting subject the hour for sleep was delayed for a time.The colonists then spoke of the future, and talked willingly of the changes which a voyage in the schooner to inhabited lands would make in their situation.But always, in the midst of these plans, prevailed the thought of a subsequent return to Lincoln Island.Never would they abandon this colony, founded with so much labor and with such success, and to which a communication with America would afford a fresh impetus.Pencroft and Neb especially hoped to end their days there."
"“赫伯特，”水手说，“你永远都不会抛弃林肯岛，是不是？”","“Herbert,” said the sailor, “you will never abandon Lincoln Island?”"
"“永远都不会，潘克洛夫，特别是如果你也打定主意要留在这里。”","“Never, Pencroft, and especially if you make up your mind to stay there.”"
"“我早就打定主意了，孩子，”潘克洛夫说，“我会等你。你把你的妻子和孩子带到这儿来，我会把你的孩子们教育成快乐的小家伙！”","“That was made up long ago, my boy,” answered Pencroft.“I shall expect you.You will bring me your wife and children, and I shall make jolly chaps of your youngsters!”"
"“就这么定了！”纳布红着脸，边笑边说。","“That’s agreed,” replied Herbert, laughing and blushing at the same time."
"“还有你，哈丁队长，”潘克洛夫满腔热忱地接着说，“你还是这个岛的领袖！啊，这里能容得下多少居民？至少一万人！”","“And you, Captain Harding,” resumed Pencroft enthusiastically, “you will be still the governor of the island!Ah, how many inhabitants could it support?Ten thousand at least!”"
"他们就以这种方式谈论着，让潘克洛夫滔滔不绝地往下说。最后通讯记者真的办了一份报纸——《林肯岛先驱新报》！","They talked in this way, allowing Pencroft to run on, and at last the reporter actually started a newspaper—the New Lincoln Herald!"
"人们的心就是这样的。从事一项永久不衰的、即使在他死后还能万古长存的事业的愿望正是人类能成为万物之主的原因。正是由于这种信念，人类才在全世界建立起自己的统治、证明了自己的力量。","So is man’s heart.The desire to perform a work which will endure, which will survive him, is the origin of his superiority over all other living creatures here below.It is this which has established his dominion, and this it is which justifies it, over all the world."
"除此之外，谁知道贾普和托普是不是也对它们的未来怀有理想呢。","After that, who knows if Jup and Top had not themselves their little dream of the future."
"艾尔顿暗暗地告诉自己，他希望能够再次见到格里那凡爵士，让他知道自己已经彻底悔过自新。","Ayrton silently said to himself that he would like to see Lord Glenarvan again and show himself to all restored."
"10月15号晚上，谈话的时间比平常要长一些。已经九点了。强忍了半天之后，大家还是打出长长的呵欠，这说明已经到了休息的时间了。潘克洛夫正要走向床边，餐厅里的电铃突然响了起来。","One evening, on the 15th of October, the conversation was prolonged later than usual.It was nine o’clock.Already, long badly concealed yawns gave warning of the hour of rest, and Pencroft was proceeding towards his bed, when the electric bell, placed in the dining-room, suddenly rang."
"赛勒斯·哈丁、吉迪恩·史佩莱、赫伯特、艾尔顿、潘克洛夫、纳布，所有人都在场。也就是说他们谁也没有到畜栏去。","All were there, Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Ayrton, Pencroft, Neb.Therefore none of the colonists were at the corral."
"赛勒斯·哈丁站了起来。同伴们你看看我，我看看你，几乎不敢相信自己的耳朵。","Cyrus Harding rose.His companions stared at each other, scarcely believing their ears."
"“这是怎么回事？”纳布叫道，“难道是魔鬼在打铃吗？”","“What does that mean?” cried Neb.“Was it the devil who rang it?”"
"没有人回答。","No one answered."
"“在这种暴风雨的天气里，”赫伯特说，“会不会是电流的感应……”","“The weather is stormy,” observed Herbert.“Might not its influence of electricity—”"
"赫伯特没有把话说完。所有人的目光都转向了工程师，他否定地摇了摇头。","Herbert did not finish his phrase.The engineer, towards whom all eyes were turned, shook his head negatively."
"“我们等一等，”吉迪恩·史佩莱说，“不管是谁，如果要告诉我们什么信号，他一定会再发的。”","“We must wait,” said Gideon Spilett.“If it is a signal, whoever it may be who has made it, he will renew it.”"
"“可是你认为是谁呢？”纳布大声地说。","“But who do you think it is?” cried Neb."
"“谁？”潘克洛夫回答，“除了他……”","“Who?” answered Pencroft, “but he—”"
"水手的话被又一声铃响打断了。","The sailor’s sentence was cut short by a new tinkle of the bell."
"哈丁走到电报机的旁边，把他的疑问通过电报发给畜栏：","Harding went to the apparatus, and sent this question to the corral:—"
"“你想要什么？”","“What do you want?”"
"过了一会儿，指针在字码表上来回移动，向花岗石宫里的移民们给出了回答：","A few moments later the needle, moving on the alphabetic dial, gave this reply to the tenants of Granite House:—"
"“马上来畜栏。”","“Come to the corral immediately.”"
"“总算来了！”哈丁大声说。","“At last!” exclaimed Harding."
"是啊！总算来了！谜底马上就要揭开了。在强烈的兴趣的鼓舞下，移民们的疲劳消失得干干净净，这种兴趣催促着他们赶紧到畜栏去，他们彻底打消了休息的念头。他们一句话都没说，很快就离开了花岗石宫，来到海滩上。只有贾普和托普留在那里，这次可以不用它们陪着去了。","Yes!At last!The mystery was about to be unveiled.The colonists’ fatigue had disappeared before the tremendous interest which was about to urge them to the corral, and all wish for rest had ceased.Without having uttered a word, in a few moments they had left Granite House, and were standing on the beach.Jup and Top alone were left behind.They could do without them."
"夜色非常昏暗。新月和太阳一起消失了。据赫伯特观察，大量的乌云在低空形成了厚厚的穹顶，一丝星光都透不过来。远处的暴风雨中划过几道闪电，照亮了水平线。","The night was black.The new moon had disappeared at the same time as the sun.As Herbert had observed, great stormy clouds formed a lowering and heavy vault, preventing any star rays.A few lightning flashes, reflections from a distant storm, illuminated the horizon."
"有可能几个小时之后，岛上就会到处都是雷声了。这个晚上的天气非常恶劣。","It was possible that a few hours later the thunder would roll over the island itself.The night was very threatening."
"但是，不管夜色多浓，都不能妨碍他们找到那条无比熟悉的通往畜栏的路。","But however deep the darkness was, it would not prevent them from finding the familiar road to the corral."
"他们爬上慈悲河的左岸，来到高地，跨过甘油河上的桥，在森林里前进。","They ascended the left bank of the Mercy, reached the plateau, passed the bridge over Creek Glycerine, and advanced through the forest."
"他们怀着无比兴奋的心情加快了步伐。毫无疑问，现在他们就要揭晓这个让他们猜测了很久的谜题的答案了，也就是那个神秘的人的名字。他和移民们的生活有着多么大的关系，帮助他们的时候是多么的慷慨，他的行动是多么的强大有力啊！如果这位陌生人没有和他们共处在一起，不了解最细小的情况，没有听过他们在花岗石宫里说的所有的话，他怎么能总是在最危急的时刻有所行动呢？","They walked at a good pace, a prey to the liveliest emotions.There was no doubt but that they were now going to learn the long-searched-for answer to the enigma, the name of that mysterious being, so deeply concerned in their life, so generous in his influence, so powerful in his action!Must not this stranger have indeed mingled with their existence, have known the smallest details, have heard all that was said in Granite House, to have been able always to act in the very nick of time?"
"每个人心里都有无数个疑团，大家快速前进。头顶上的树枝浓密，他们都看不清路的边界了。森林里一点声音都没有。在这种气压很低的环境里，飞禽走兽都一动不动的，安静极了。连吹动树叶的微风都没有。只能听见移民的脚步在坚实的地面上发出的回响。","Every one, wrapped up in his own reflections, pressed forward.Under the arch of trees the darkness was such that even the edge of the road could not be seen.Not a sound in the forest.Both animals and birds, influenced by the heaviness of the atmosphere, remained motionless and silent.Not a breath disturbed the leaves.The footsteps of the colonists alone resounded on the hardened ground."
"在第一个小时的前十五分钟，只有潘克洛夫的话打破了周围的寂静：","During the first quarter of an hour the silence was only interrupted by this remark from Pencroft:—"
"“我们应该带一个火把。”","“We ought to have brought a torch.”"
"工程师回答道：","And by this reply from the engineer:—"
"“我们可以在畜栏里找一个。”","“We shall find one at the corral.”"
"九点十二分时，哈丁和他的同伴们离开花岗石宫。从慈悲河到畜栏一共五英里，九点四十七分时，他们走完了三英里。","Harding and his companions had left Granite House at twelve minutes past nine.At forty-seven minutes past nine they had traversed three out of the five miles which separated the mouth of the Mercy from the corral."
"这时，荒岛上方亮起了闪电，照亮了黑暗的森林。电光十分耀眼，照得他们睁不开眼睛。显然，暴风雨很快就要来了。","At that moment sheets of lightning spread over the island and illumined the dark trees.The flashes dazzled and almost blinded them.Evidently the storm would not be long in bursting forth."
"闪电渐渐地越来越亮，间隔也越来越短。远处的雷声在空中隆隆作响。环境令人窒息。","The flashes gradually became brighter and more rapid.Distant thunder growled in the sky.The atmosphere was stifling."
"移民们好像被一股不可抗拒的力量推动着，快速地前进着。","The colonists proceeded as if they were urged onwards by some irresistible force."
"十点钟时，一道耀眼的闪电让他们看见了畜栏的栅栏，他们到达大门的时候，狂风暴雨接踵而至。","At ten o’clock a vivid flash showed them the palisade, and as they reached the gate the storm burst forth with tremendous fury."
"很快他们就穿过了畜栏，哈丁来到小屋前。","In a minute the corral was crossed, and Harding stood before the hut."
"电报是从畜栏里发出来的，因此大概房子已经被陌生人占领了。然而，并没有灯光从窗户射出来。","Probably the house was occupied by the stranger, since it was from thence that the telegram had been sent.However, no light shone through the window."
"工程师敲了一下门。","The engineer knocked at the door."
"没有回应。","No answer."
"赛勒斯·哈丁打开门，移民们走了进去，屋里一片漆黑。纳布划了一根火柴，点着了灯笼，灯光照亮了屋子的每个角落。","Cyrus Harding opened the door, and the settlers entered the room, which was perfectly dark.A light was struck by Neb, and in a few moments the lantern was lighted and the light thrown into every corner of the room."
"一个人都没有。一切都保持着他们离开时候的样子。","There was no one there.Everything was in the state in which it had been left."
"“我们是被幻觉蒙蔽了吗？”赛勒斯·哈丁低声说。","“Have we been deceived by an illusion?” murmured Cyrus Harding."
"不！这不可能！电报清清楚楚地说：","No! that was not possible!The telegram had clearly said,—"
"“马上来畜栏。”","“Come to the corral immediately.”"
"他们走到专门用来放电报机的桌子旁边。一切井然有序——电池好好地装在匣子里，电报机依旧保持着原来的样子。","They approached the table specially devoted to the use of the wire.Everything was in order—the pile on the box containing it, as well as all the apparatus."
"“最后一个来这儿的是谁？”工程师问。","“Who came here the last time?” asked the engineer."
"“是我，队长。”艾尔顿回答。","“I did, captain,” answered Ayrton."
"“那是在……”","“And that was—”"
"“四天之前。”","“Four days ago.”"
"“啊！一张字条！”赫伯特指着桌子上的一张纸，大声叫道。","“Ah! a note!” cried Herbert, pointing to a paper lying on the table."
"纸上用英文写着这些话：","On this paper were written these words in English:—"
"“沿着新电线一直走。”","“Follow the new wire.”"
"“走吧！”哈丁大声说。这时他明白了，电报并不是从畜栏发出来的，而是通过一根附加在原来的电线上面的新电线，从神秘的住处直接和花岗石宫联系上的。","“Forward!” cried Harding, who understood that the despatch had not been sent from the corral, but from the mysterious retreat, communicating directly with Granite House by means of a supplementary wire joined to the old one."
"纳布拿着点亮的灯，大家一起离开畜栏。这时候暴风雨来势凶猛。闪电和雷声的间隙特别短暂。不断冒出烟雾的火山顶不时被闪电照亮。","Neb took the lighted lantern, and all left the corral.The storm then burst forth with tremendous violence.The interval between each lightning-flash and each thunder-clap diminished rapidly.The summit of the volcano, with its plume of vapor, could be seen by occasional flashes."
"在畜栏的房屋和栅栏之间到处都找不到电报线。工程师径直跑到第一根电线杆旁边，在闪电的照射下，看见一根新线从绝缘物上一直拖到地面。","There was no telegraphic communication in any part of the corral between the house and the palisade; but the engineer, running straight to the first post, saw by the light of a flash a new wire hanging from the isolator to the ground."
"“在这儿呢！”他说。","“There it is!” said he."
"这根电线拖在地面上，像海下的电缆似的被一层绝缘物体包裹着，这样电流就能在里面自由通过。它似乎穿过森林和富兰克林山的南部支脉，朝着西面一直延伸。","This wire lay along the ground, and was surrounded with an isolating substance like a submarine cable, so as to assure the free transmission of the current.It appeared to pass through the wood and the southern spurs of the mountain, and consequently it ran towards the west."
"“跟着它走！”赛勒斯·哈丁说。","“Follow it!” said Cyrus Harding."
"移民们立刻沿着电线急速往前走。","And the settlers immediately pressed forward, guided by the wire."
"雷声继续轰鸣，淹没了他们说话的声音。不过，大家都在尽快往前走，顾不上说话了。","The thunder continued to roar with such violence that not a word could be heard.However, there was no occasion for speaking, but to get forward as fast as possible."
"赛勒斯·哈丁和他的同伴们爬上畜栏所在的山谷和瀑布河谷之间突起的支脉，从最狭窄的地方跨过瀑布河。电线有时被放在了较低的树枝上，有时拖在地面上，指引着他们前进的方向。工程师认为电线可能会把他们带到山谷的尽头，那里也就是陌生人的住处了。","Cyrus Harding and his companions then climbed the spur rising between the corral valley and that of Falls River, which they crossed at its narrowest part.The wire, sometimes stretched over the lower branches of the trees, sometimes lying on the ground, guided them surely.The engineer had supposed that the wire would perhaps stop at the bottom of the valley, and that the stranger’s retreat would be there."
"然而事实并不是这样。他们不得不爬上西南支脉，再下到贫瘠的高地上，那里的尽头是奇形怪状的、荒凉的玄武岩峭壁。移民们时不时地要弯下腰去摸索电线。现在已经毫无疑问了，电线直接通向大海。他们苦苦寻觅而不得的住处，一定就在那些岩石的深处。","Nothing of the sort.They were obliged to ascend the south-western spur, and re-descend on that arid plateau terminated by the strangely-wild basalt cliff.From time to time one of the colonists stooped down and felt for the wire with his hands; but there was now no doubt that the wire was running directly towards the sea.There, to a certainty, in the depths of those rocks, was the dwelling so long sought for in vain."
"天空像着了火似的，不断闪烁着电光。几道闪电打在了浓烟环绕的火山顶上。看上去火山好像在喷火一样。快到十一点的时候，移民们到达了从西面俯瞰大洋的高耸的峭壁上。这时刮起了风。五百英尺之下，海浪在咆哮着。","The sky was literally on fire.Flash succeeded flash.Several struck the summit of the volcano in the midst of the thick smoke.It appeared there as if the mountain was vomiting flame.At a few minutes to eleven the colonists arrived on the high cliff overlooking the ocean to the west.The wind had risen.The surf roared 500 feet below."
"哈丁估计他们从畜栏出来之后已经走了一英里半了。","Harding calculated that they had gone a mile and a half from the corral."
"电线沿着狭窄的山谷较为陡峭的一边，就在这个地方进入了岩石堆。移民们冒着被摇摇欲坠的岩石砸中的危险顺着电线往前走，随时都有可能掉到海里。尤其是下坡特别困难，但是他们没有顾及到这些危险；他们身不由己，一种不可抗拒的力量就像吸铁石似的，引着他们朝那个神秘的地方走去。","At this point the wire entered among the rocks, following the steep side of a narrow ravine.The settlers followed it at the risk of occasioning a fall of the slightly-balanced rocks, and being dashed into the sea.The descent was extremely perilous, but they did not think of the danger; they were no longer masters of themselves, and an irresistible attraction drew them towards this mysterious place as the magnet draws iron."
"即使在大白天，这样的峡谷都是很难通行的，他们竟然不知不觉地沿着它走了下去。","Thus they almost unconsciously descended this ravine, which even in broad daylight would have been considered impracticable."
"当他们在亮光中穿行时，岩石滚落，像火球一样闪耀。哈丁走在最前面——艾尔顿走在最后面。他们一步一步往前走，一会儿摔倒在湿滑的岩石上，一会儿挣扎着站起来继续往前爬行。","The stones rolled and sparkled like fiery balls when they crossed through the gleams of light.Harding was first—Ayrton last.On they went, step by step.Now they slid over the slippery rock; then they struggled to their feet and scrambled on."
"最终电线到了海滩的岩石堆。移民们已经到了玄武岩峭壁的底部了。","At last the wire touched the rocks on the beach.The colonists had reached the bottom of the basalt cliff."
"这里出现了一条狭窄的分水岭，和海面保持着平行的水平方向。移民们沿着电线，在分水岭上往前走。走了不到一百步，分水岭平缓地下降到和海面同一高度。","There appeared a narrow ridge, running horizontally and parallel with the sea.The settlers followed the wire along it.They had not gone a hundred paces when the ridge by a moderate incline sloped down to the level of the sea."
"工程师抓住电线，发现它消失在海浪之下。","The engineer seized the wire and found that it disappeared beneath the waves."
"他的同伴们个个目瞪口呆。","His companions were stupefied."
"他们十分失望，几乎快要绝望地大叫起来！难道他们要钻到水底下去找什么海底洞穴吗？以他们当时兴奋的状态，他们应该会毫不犹豫地这样做。","A cry of disappointment, almost a cry of despair, escaped them!Must they then plunge beneath the water and seek there for some submarine cavern?In their excited state they would not have hesitated to do it."
"工程师拦住他们。","The engineer stopped them."
"他把同伴们带到一个石洞里，就在那儿——","He led his companions to a hollow in the rocks, and there—"
"“我们必须等一等，”他说，“现在潮水很高。等到潮水落下去，就会有路了。”","“We must wait,” said he.“The tide is high.At low water the way will be open.”"
"“但是你怎么知道的……”潘克洛夫问。","“But what can make you think-” asked Pencroft."
"“如果我们到不了他那儿，他就不会叫我们来了！”","“He would not have called us if the means had been wanting to enable us to reach him!”"
"赛勒斯·哈丁的语气里充满了信心，谁也没有提出反对。再者说，他的说法也合乎逻辑。水位降低的时候，峭壁底部就会出现一条可以通行的道路，尽管现在它被海水淹没了。他们还要等上一段时间。移民们安静地蜷缩在一个很深的山洞里。这时，大雨倾泻而下。雷声在岩石间发出响亮的回音。","Cyrus Harding spoke in a tone of such thorough conviction that no objection was raised.His remark, besides, was logical.It was quite possible that an opening, practicable at low water, though hidden now by the high tide, opened at the foot of the cliff.There was some time to wait.The colonists remained silently crouching in a deep hollow.Rain now began to fall in torrents.The thunder was re-echoed among the rocks with a grand sonorousness."
"移民们的情绪非常高涨。他们的脑海中出现了成百上千个稀奇古怪的念头。他们期望见到一个高大的、超出常人的神灵，只有这种形象才能与他们心目中的岛上神秘天才吻合。","The colonists’ emotion was great.A thousand strange and extraordinary ideas crossed their brains, and they expected some grand and superhuman apparition, which alone could come up to the notion they had formed of the mysterious genius of the island."
"午夜时分，哈丁拿着灯，下到海滩上去查探。","At midnight, Harding carrying the lantern, descended to the beach to reconnoiter."
"果然不出工程师所料，水下露出一个巨大的洞口。就在那儿，电线拐了一个直角，进入开阔的港湾。","The engineer was not mistaken.The beginning of an immense excavation could be seen under the water.There the wire, bending at a right angle, entered the yawning gulf."
"赛勒斯·哈丁回到他的同伴那儿，轻描淡写地说：","Cyrus Harding returned to his companions, and said simply,—"
"“再过一个钟头，洞里就可以通行了。”","“In an hour the opening will be practicable.”"
"“那里真的有洞吗？”潘克洛夫问。","“It is there, then?” said Pencroft."
"“你还怀疑这一点？”哈丁反问。","“Did you doubt it?” returned Harding."
"“可是洞里的水位一定很高。”赫伯特说。","“But this cavern must be filled with water to a certain height,” observed Herbert."
"“要么洞里的水完全干了，”哈丁回答，“那样我们就可以徒步走进去，要么就是没有完全干，但是会有供我们使用的交通工具。”","“Either the cavern will be completely dry,” replied Harding, “and in that case we can traverse it on foot, or it will not be dry, and some means of transport will be put at our disposal.”"
"一个钟头过去了。大家都冒雨沿着分水岭下到了海面上。这时候洞口已经有八英尺露出水面了。它看上去像桥拱似的，下面就是澎湃的海水。","An hour passed.All climbed down through the rain to the level of the sea.There was now eight feet of the opening above the water.It was like the arch of a bridge, under which rushed the foaming water."
"工程师身体前倾，看见了一个黑色的物体在水面上漂浮着。他把它拉过来。那是一艘小船，系在洞里突出的石头上。船身被铁皮包裹着，底部还放着两把桨。","Leaning forward, the engineer saw a black object floating on the water.He drew it towards him.It was a boat, moored to some interior projection of the cave.This boat was iron-plated.Two oars lay at the bottom."
"“跳上去！”哈丁说。","“Jump in!” said Harding."
"移民们立刻上了船。纳布和艾尔顿划着桨，潘克洛夫掌着舵。赛勒斯·哈丁拿着灯，在船头照路。","In a moment the settlers were in the boat.Neb and Ayrton took the oars, Pencroft the rudder.Cyrus Harding in the bows, with the lantern, lighted the way."
"小船首先穿过一个椭圆形的突然升高的洞顶，但是周围实在是太黑了，灯光又很微弱，他们无法确定洞的宽度、长度、高度和深度。这个玄武岩的石洞里一点声音都没有。外面的声音，哪怕是隆隆作响的雷声都无法透过厚厚的石壁传到洞里来。","The elliptical roof, under which the boat at first passed, suddenly rose; but the darkness was too deep, and the light of the lantern too slight, for either the extent, length, height, or depth of the cave to be ascertained.Solemn silence reigned in this basaltic cavern.Not a sound could penetrate into it, even the thunder peals could not pierce its thick sides."
"世界上的很多地方都有这样的巨大石洞，这些天然的地穴的历史可以追溯到地球的地质时代。有的石洞被海水填满了，有的里面包含着一整个湖泊。赫布利底群岛中的史泰法岛上的芬加尔洞窟、布列塔尼半岛上的杜瓦尔那内港的莫尔加洞窟、科西嘉岛博尼法西奥港的洞窟、挪威来福德洞窟以及肯特基州的500英尺高、20多英里长的巨大的曼莫斯洞窟都是这样的洞窟。在世界上的很多地方，大自然都开凿了这样的洞窟以供人们欣赏。","Such immense caves exist in various parts of the world, natural crypts dating from the geological epoch of the globe.Some are filled by the sea; others contain entire lakes in their sides.Such is Fingal’s Cave, in the island of Staffa, one of the Hebrides; such are the caves of Morgat, in the bay of Douarnenez, in Brittany, the caves of Bonifacio, in Corsica, those of Lyse-Fjord, in Norway; such are the immense Mammoth caverns in Kentucky, 500 feet in height, and more than twenty miles in length!In many parts of the globe, nature has excavated these caverns, and preserved them for the admiration of man."
"移民们现在探索的洞窟会不会一直通向荒岛的中心呢？小船又弯弯曲曲地往前走了一刻钟，工程师不时发出简短的指令，为潘克洛夫指方向。","Did the cavern which the settlers were now exploring extend to the center of the island?For a quarter of an hour the boat had been advancing, making detours, indicated to Pencroft by the engineer in short sentences, when all at once,—"
"“再往右一点！”他命令道。","“More to the right!” he commanded."
"小船改变了航道，沿着右侧的石壁前进。工程师想看看电线是否一直延伸到这里。","The boat, altering its course, came up alongside the right wall.The engineer wished to see if the wire still ran along the side."
"电线就架在身边的岩石上。","The wire was there fastened to the rock."
"“前进！”哈丁说。","“Forward!” said Harding."
"两把桨推着小船在黑暗的水里往前走。","And the two oars, plunging into the dark waters, urged the boat onwards."
"他们又划了一刻钟，从洞口到这里肯定有半英里了，这时又听哈丁说：","On they went for another quarter of an hour, and a distance of half-a-mile must have been cleared from the mouth of the cave, when Harding’s voice was again heard."
"“停下！”","“Stop!” said he."
"小船停了下来，移民们看见一道明亮的光线照亮了这个在荒岛内部开凿的巨大的石洞，他们从来没有想到过会有这样一个地方。","The boat stopped, and the colonists perceived a bright light illuminating the vast cavern, so deeply excavated in the bowels of the island, of which nothing had ever led them to suspect the existence."
"玄武岩石柱支撑着高达上百英尺的圆形拱顶。这些成千上万的奇怪的石柱从地球形成的最初时期依靠自然的力量竖立起来，上面有许多不规则的穹窿和奇形怪状的花边。玄武岩的石柱一个接着一个，高度从40英尺到50英尺不等。尽管洞外海水汹涌澎湃，洞里的水却平静地冲刷着石柱的底部。工程师指出明亮的光源，光线照遍所有的岩石，倾泻在石壁之上。","At a height of a hundred feet rose the vaulted roof, supported on basalt shafts.Irregular arches, strange moldings, appeared on the columns erected by nature in thousands from the first epochs of the formation of the globe.The basalt pillars, fitted one into the other, measured from forty to fifty feet in height, and the water, calm in spite of the tumult outside, washed their base.The brilliant focus of light, pointed out by the engineer, touched every point of rocks, and flooded the walls with light."
"在光线的照耀下，水面泛起明亮的波光，小船看上去像是在两面闪耀的地带之间漂浮着。中心光源向四周发射出光芒，清清楚楚地照亮了洞里的每个角落和每块突出的岩石。这种光的性质移民们不可能弄错。从它那银白的颜色不难看出，光是从电源处发出来的。它是这个洞的太阳，照亮了整个洞窟。","By reflection the water reproduced the brilliant sparkles, so that the boat appeared to be floating between two glittering zones.They could not be mistaken in the nature of the irradiation thrown from the glowing nucleus, whose clear rays were shattered by all the angles, all the projections of the cavern.This light proceeded from an electric source, and its white color betrayed its origin.It was the sun of this cave, and it filled it entirely."
"赛勒斯·哈丁做了一个手势，双桨又开始划动了，有规律地溅起的水花像珠宝一样。小船朝着光源的方向推进，现在他们和那里之间的距离已经不到半锚链了。","At a sign from Cyrus Harding the oars again plunged into the water, causing a regular shower of gems, and the boat was urged forward towards the light, which was now not more than half a cable’s length distant."
"在这里水面的宽度大概有350英尺，在耀眼的光源上面，可以看见一面巨大的玄武岩石壁，完全堵住了那边的路。这部分的洞窟很宽，海水形成了一个小湖。电光把洞顶、石壁、尽头的悬崖、所有的棱柱和尖顶都照得灿烂夺目，好像光是从它们身上发出来的。","At this place the breadth of the sheet of water measured nearly 350 feet, and beyond the dazzling center could be seen an enormous basaltic wall, blocking up any issue on that side.The cavern widened here considerably, the sea forming a little lake.But the roof, the side walls, the end cliff, all the prisms, all the peaks, were flooded with the electric fluid, so that the brilliancy belonged to them, and as if the light issued from them."
"湖中心漂浮着一个长长的、雪茄烟形状的物体，它安静地、一动不动地浮在水面上。光从它的两侧射出来，就好像是从两个烧得白热的火炉里发出来似的。这个东西的外形像一只巨大的鲸鱼，大约有250英尺长，高出水面10到12英尺。","In the center of the lake a long cigar-shaped object floated on the surface of the water, silent, motionless.The brilliancy which issued from it escaped from its sides as from two kilns heated to a white heat.This apparatus, similar in shape to an enormous whale, was about 250 feet long, and rose about ten or twelve above the water."
"小船慢慢地向它靠近，赛勒斯·哈丁站在船头。他凝视着，兴奋得不能自已。然后，他突然抓住通讯记者的胳膊：","The boat slowly approached it, Cyrus Harding stood up in the bows.He gazed, a prey to violent excitement.Then, all at once, seizing the reporter’s arm,—"
"“是他！一定是他！”他叫道，“他……”","“It is he!It can only be he!” he cried, “he!—”"
"然后，他坐回到自己的位置上，低声地说了一个名字，只有吉迪恩·史佩莱听到他说了什么。","Then, falling back on the seat, he murmured a name which Gideon Spilett alone could hear."
"显然通讯记者知道这个名字，因为他听了之后，反应很奇怪，然后他用沙哑的声音说：","The reporter evidently knew this name, for it had a wonderful effect upon him, and he answered in a hoarse voice,—"
"“他！那个逃犯！”","“He! an outlawed man!”"
"“是他！”哈丁说。","“He!” said Harding."
"按照工程师的命令，小船逐渐靠近这个奇怪的漂浮物。船被停在了它的左边，一道光线穿过厚厚的玻璃从这里射了出来。","At the engineer’s command the boat approached this singular floating apparatus.The boat touched the left side, from which escaped a ray of light through a thick glass."
"哈丁和他的同伴们登上平台。那里有一个打开的舱口。大家一同朝那儿冲下去。","Harding and his companions mounted on the platform.An open hatchway was there.All darted down the opening."
"梯子的底部连着的甲板被电灯照亮。甲板的尽头有一扇关着的门，哈丁把门打开。","At the bottom of the ladder was a deck, lighted by electricity.At the end of this deck was a door, which Harding opened."
"这是一间装饰得富丽堂皇的房间，移民们迅速穿了过去，来到隔壁的书房。从书房上方明亮的天花板上投下一片光辉。","A richly-ornamented room, quickly traversed by the colonists, was joined to a library, over which a luminous ceiling shed a flood of light."
"书房的尽头有一扇同样也是关着的大门，工程师把它打开。","At the end of the library a large door, also shut, was opened by the engineer."
"这是一间宽敞的大厅——这里像博物馆似的，各种珍贵的矿物质成品、艺术品和令人惊奇的工业品呈现在移民们眼前，让他们觉得自己好像突然间到了魅力之境。","An immense saloon—a sort of museum, in which were heaped up, with all the treasures of the mineral world, works of art, marvels of industry—appeared before the eyes of the colonists, who almost thought themselves suddenly transported into a land of enchantment."
"他们看见在一张高贵的沙发上躺着一个人，那个人似乎没有察觉到他们的到来。","Stretched on a rich sofa they saw a man, who did not appear to notice their presence."
"然后哈丁开口了。让他的同伴们极为惊讶的是，他说了下面的话：","Then Harding raised his voice, and to the extreme surprise of his companions, he uttered these words,—"
"“尼摩船长，是你叫我们来的！我们来了！”","“Captain Nemo, you asked for us!We are here.—”"
"第十六章","Chapter 16"
"听了这几句话以后，倚在沙发上的人站了起来。电灯的灯光照在他的脸上，他相貌俊朗，高高的额头，眼神熠熠有光，胡须雪白，头发浓密，一直垂到肩膀上。","At these words the reclining figure rose, and the electric light fell upon his countenance; a magnificent head, the forehead high, the glance commanding, beard white, hair abundant and falling over the shoulders."
"他的一只手还撑在刚才起身时靠的沙发垫上。他表现得十分平静。很明显，由于患病，他的体力已经渐渐衰弱了。但他的声音还是那么有力，他十分惊讶地用英语说道：","His hand rested upon the cushion of the divan from which he had just risen.He appeared perfectly calm.It was evident that his strength had been gradually undermined by illness, but his voice seemed yet powerful, as he said in English, and in a tone which evinced extreme surprise,—"
"“先生，我没有名字。”","“Sir, I have no name.”"
"“可是，我认识你！”赛勒斯·哈丁回答道。","“Nevertheless, I know you!” replied Cyrus Harding."
"尼摩船长用尖锐的眼光盯着工程师，好像要吃了他一样。","Captain Nemo fixed his penetrating gaze upon the engineer, as though he were about to annihilate him."
"然后，他又靠回到沙发的垫子上。","Then, falling back amid the pillows of the divan,—"
"“即便如此，现在还有什么关系？”他低声地说，“我就要死了！”","“After all, what matters now?” he murmured; “I am dying!”"
"赛勒斯·哈丁走到船长身边，吉迪恩·史佩莱握住他的手——从手的温度看，他在发高烧。艾尔顿、潘克洛夫、赫伯特和纳布在大厅远处的角落里恭恭敬敬地站着。这个华丽的大厅里充满了电灯灯光。","Cyrus Harding drew near the captain, and Gideon Spilett took his hand—it was of a feverish heat.Ayrton, Pencroft, Herbert, and Neb stood respectfully apart in an angle of the magnificent saloon, whose atmosphere was saturated with the electric fluid."
"这时，尼摩船长把手缩回去，示意工程师和通讯记者坐下。","Meanwhile Captain Nemo withdrew his hand, and motioned the engineer and the reporter to be seated."
"大家都怀着深切激动的心情看着他。在他们面前的就是被大家尊为“岛上的天才”的那个人，这个强大的保护者，他在不同的场合，一次次对他们进行救援，而且每次救援都那么有效，他们欠下这位恩人多少恩情！在他们眼前的只不过是一个人，一个快要死的人，而此前潘克洛夫和纳布还以为会发现一个超自然的圣人！","All regarded him with profound emotion.Before them they beheld that being whom they had styled the “genius of the island,” the powerful protector whose intervention, in so many circumstances, had been so efficacious, the benefactor to whom they owed such a debt of gratitude!Their eyes beheld a man only, and a man at the point of death, where Pencroft and Neb had expected to find an almost supernatural being!"
"可是，塞勒斯·哈丁是怎么认出尼摩船长的呢？为什么尼摩听到塞勒斯说出这个名字时突然站起身来呢？尼摩船长以为谁也不知道他的名字。","But how happened it that Cyrus Harding had recognized Captain Nemo? why had the latter so suddenly risen on hearing this name uttered, a name which he had believed known to none?—"
"船长又重新躺回沙发上，他把头枕在一只胳膊上，望着坐在旁边的工程师。","The captain had resumed his position on the divan, and leaning on his arm, he regarded the engineer, seated near him."
"“你知道我过去的名字，先生？”他问道。","“You know the name I formerly bore, sir?” he asked."
"“是的，”赛勒斯·哈丁回答道，“还有这只神奇的潜水艇的名字……”","“I do,” answered Cyrus Harding, “and also that of this wonderful submarine vessel—”"
"“‘诺第留斯号’吗？”船长淡淡地笑了笑。","“The ‘Nautilus’?” said the captain, with a faint smile."
"“是的，是‘诺第留斯号’。”","“The ‘Nautilus.’”"
"“可是你……你知道我是谁吗？”","“But do you—do you know who I am?”"
"“我知道。”","“I do.”"
"“我与世隔绝已经很多年了。我在海底度过了漫长的30年，这是我找到的唯一自由的地方！是谁出卖了我的秘密呢？”","“It is nevertheless many years since I have held any communication with the inhabited world; three long years have I passed in the depth of the sea, the only place where I have found liberty!Who then can have betrayed my secret?”"
"“是一个不受您约束的人，尼摩船长，所以，您不能责备他背叛您。”","“A man who was bound to you by no tie, Captain Nemo, and who, consequently, cannot be accused of treachery.”"
"“是16年前偶然来到我船上的那个法国人吗？”","“The Frenchman who was cast on board my vessel by chance sixteen years since?”"
"“是的。”","“The same.”"
"“他和他的两个同伴并没有在大漩涡里遇难，当时‘诺第留斯号’正在漩涡中间挣扎？”","“He and his two companions did not then perish in the maelstrom, in the midst of which the ‘Nautilus’ was struggling?”"
"“他们逃脱了，而且还写了一本叫《海底两万里》的书，书里写了您的历史。”","“They escaped, and a book has appeared under the title of ‘Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea,’ which contains your history.”"
"“那只是我一生中的几个月的历史！”船长冲动地打断了他的话。","“The history of a few months only of my life!” interrupted the captain impetuously."
"“是的，”赛勒斯·哈丁回答道，“但是这几个月的奇怪生活已经足够让人们了解您。”","“It is true,” answered Cyrus Harding, “but a few months of that strange life have sufficed to make you known.”"
"“我是个罪人，这是毫无疑问的。”尼摩船长说，他的唇边露出一丝傲慢的微笑。“是的，一个反叛者，也许是一个与人类为敌的反叛者！”","“As a great criminal, doubtless!” said Captain Nemo, a haughty smile curling his lips.“Yes, a rebel, perhaps an outlaw against humanity!”"
"工程师没有说话。","The engineer was silent."
"“是吗，先生？”","“Well, sir?”"
"“不应该由我来评判您，尼摩船长，”塞勒斯·哈丁回答道，“至少是关于您过去的生活。我和世界上其他人一样，不知道您选择这种奇怪生活方式的动机是什么。在不知道原因之前，我不能加以评判。但是，我知道的是，我们上了林肯岛之后，不断有人对我们伸出援手保护我们，正是有了这个善良、慷慨、万能的人，我们才能活下来，而这个善良、慷慨、万能的人就是您，尼摩船长！”","“It is not for me to judge you, Captain Nemo,” answered Cyrus Harding, “at any rate as regards your past life.I am, with the rest of the world, ignorant of the motives which induced you to adopt this strange mode of existence, and I cannot judge of effects without knowing their causes; but what I do know is, that a beneficent hand has constantly protected us since our arrival on Lincoln Island, that we all owe our lives to a good, generous, and powerful being, and that this being so powerful, good and generous, Captain Nemo, is yourself!”"
"“是我。”船长简短地说。","“It is I,” answered the captain simply."
"工程师和通讯记者站起身来。伙伴们也靠拢过来，他们内心的感激之情就要通过动作和言语表达出来。","The engineer and the reporter rose.Their companions had drawn near, and the gratitude with which their hearts were charged was about to express itself in their gestures and words."
"尼摩船长做了一个手势阻止了他们，他的声音表明，他无法掩饰激动的情绪。","Captain Nemo stopped them by a sign, and in a voice which betrayed more emotion than he doubtless intended to show."
"“等你们把故事听完吧。”他说。","“Wait till you have heard all,” he said."
"船长用短短几句话，讲述了他的往事。","And the captain, in a few concise sentences, ran over the events of his life."
"他的叙述很短，然而他却不得不振奋起最后的全部精力把故事讲完。十分明显，他在和极度虚弱的身体做斗争。好几次，赛勒斯·哈丁都恳求他休息一会儿，但是他摇了摇头，好像再没有明天一样。当通讯记者提出要为他医治时，","His narrative was short, yet he was obliged to summon up his whole remaining energy to arrive at the end.He was evidently contending against extreme weakness.Several times Cyrus Harding entreated him to repose for a while, but he shook his head as a man to whom the morrow may never come, and when the reporter offered his assistance,—"
"“没用了”，他说，“我已时日不多。”","“It is useless,” he said; “my hours are numbered.”"
"尼摩船长是印度的达卡王子，本德尔汗德君王的儿子，当时本德尔汗德还保持独立。他十岁那年，他的父亲把他送到欧洲去接受全面的教育，希望将来他能凭借自己的才干和学识，领导长期落后的祖国赶上欧洲国家。","Captain Nemo was an Indian, the Prince Dakkar, son of a rajah of the then independent territory of Bundelkund.His father sent him, when ten years of age, to Europe, in order that he might receive an education in all respects complete, and in the hopes that by his talents and knowledge he might one day take a leading part in raising his long degraded and heathen country to a level with the nations of Europe."
"达卡王子天资聪颖，从十岁到三十岁，他积累了各方面知识，在科学、文学和艺术方面都有很深的造诣。","From the age of ten years to that of thirty Prince Dakkar, endowed by Nature with her richest gifts of intellect, accumulated knowledge of every kind, and in science, literature, and art his researches were extensive and profound."
"他游历了整个欧洲。他的出身和财富使得到处有人逢迎追捧。但是，世间的欢愉并不能引起他的兴趣。他虽然年轻，又富有各种优势，但他总是非常严肃，甚至是忧郁。他的求知欲十分强烈，他内心强烈希望能成为一个伟大而强有力的领导者，领导自由而文明的人民。","He traveled over the whole of Europe.His rank and fortune caused him to be everywhere sought after; but the pleasures of the world had for him no attractions.Though young and possessed of every personal advantage, he was ever grave—somber even—devoured by an unquenchable thirst for knowledge, and cherishing in the recesses of his heart the hope that he might become a great and powerful ruler of a free and enlightened people."
"然而，长久以来，他对科学的热爱胜过了其他的情感。他成了一个被艺术深深打动的艺术家，懂得各种高深科学的哲学家和通晓欧洲宫廷政策的政治家。对于那些从表面上观察他的人来说，人们也许会认为他是一个世界主义者，求知若渴却轻视行动；一个富有的旅行者，孤傲清高，不断地从一个地方走到另一个地方却没有祖国。","Still, for long the love of science triumphed over all other feelings.He became an artist deeply impressed by the marvels of art, a philosopher to whom no one of the higher sciences was unknown, a statesman versed in the policy of European courts.To the eyes of those who observed him superficially he might have passed for one of those cosmopolitans, curious of knowledge, but disdaining action; one of those opulent travelers, haughty and cynical, who move incessantly from place to place, and are of no country."
"（事实上，尼摩船长的故事已经出版在那本名为《海底两万里》的书中。前文提到艾尔顿的冒险经历时，在日期方面存在的偏差可以在这里得到印证。在这点上，读者应该参照已出版那本书上的注释。）","(The history of Captain Nemo has, in fact, been published under the title of “Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea.”Here, therefore, will apply the observation already made as to the adventures of Ayrton with regard to the discrepancy of dates.Readers should therefore refer to the note already published on this point.)"
"然而，这位艺术家、哲学家仍然心怀旧时的希望。","This artist, this philosopher, this man was, however, still cherishing the hope instilled into him from his earliest days."
"1849年达卡王子回到本德尔汗德。他娶了一个印度贵族女人，她和他一样有着狂热的追求。他们生了两个孩子，夫妇两个都十分喜爱他们。但是家庭的幸福并没有阻止他寻找实现目标的道路。他等待着时机。最后，正如他想像的那样，机会来了。","Prince Dakkar returned to Bundelkund in the year 1849.He married a noble Indian lady, who was imbued with an ambition not less ardent than that by which he was inspired.Two children were born to them, whom they tenderly loved.But domestic happiness did not prevent him from seeking to carry out the object at which he aimed.He waited an opportunity.At length, as he vainly fancied, it presented itself."
"在同样雄心勃勃、却不够明智、不够谨慎的其他王子的煽动下，印度人民认为他们可以成功起来反抗英国统治者，这些使他们脱离了混乱、战争与灾祸，并在他们的国家建立了和平和繁荣的统治者。由于他们的无知与迷信，他们沦为狡猾的领导者的工具。","Instigated by princes equally ambitious and less sagacious and more unscrupulous than he was, the people of India were persuaded that they might successfully rise against their English rulers, who had brought them out of a state of anarchy and constant warfare and misery, and had established peace and prosperity in their country.Their ignorance and gross superstition made them the facile tools of their designing chiefs."
"1857年，印度士兵爆发了武装起义。达卡王子坚信他实现长期理想的机会到了，很快便投入到起义之中。他立刻把他的才能和财富投入到这项事业中。他身先士卒，战斗在最前线。他和那些不幸的下层人民和被误导的狂热分子一起冒着生命危险战斗。他参加过二十次战斗，负过十次伤，随时做好了牺牲的准备。最终，血腥的叛变被平息了，这场残暴的起义结束了。","In 1857 the great sepoy revolt broke out.Prince Dakkar, under the belief that he should thereby have the opportunity of attaining the object of his long-cherished ambition, was easily drawn into it.He forthwith devoted his talents and wealth to the service of this cause.He aided it in person; he fought in the front ranks; he risked his life equally with the humblest of the wretched and misguided fanatics; he was ten times wounded in twenty engagements, seeking death but finding it not, but at length the sanguinary rebels were utterly defeated, and the atrocious mutiny was brought to an end."
"英国在印度的势力从未遭到这样的打击。而且，如果印度士兵像他们希望的那样得到外界的援助，英国在亚洲的影响和霸权也许会成为过去。","Never before had the British power in India been exposed to such danger, and if, as they had hoped, the sepoys had received assistance from without, the influence and supremacy in Asia of the United Kingdom would have been a thing of the past."
"那时候，达卡王子的名字家喻户晓。他公开作战，毫不躲藏。当局悬赏要他的头颅，但是他设法逃脱了。","The name of Prince Dakkar was at that time well known.He had fought openly and without concealment.A price was set upon his head, but he managed to escape from his pursuers."
"文明永远不会倒退，自然规律推动着文明前进。印度士兵被打败了，以前印度君王统治的土地又沦陷到英国的统治下。","Civilization never recedes; the law of necessity ever forces it onwards.The sepoys were vanquished, and the land of the rajahs of old fell again under the rule of England."
"达卡王子没有实现他所追求的献身，回到本德尔汗德的深山中。他一个人在那里生活。希望破灭后他极度失望，对人类的一切表示厌恶，对文明世界也充满了仇恨。他变卖了他的财产，召集了20个最忠诚的伙伴，在某一天悄无声息的消失了。","Prince Dakkar, unable to find that death he courted, returned to the mountain fastnesses of Bundelkund.There, alone in the world, overcome by disappointment at the destruction of all his vain hopes, a prey to profound disgust for all human beings, filled with hatred of the civilized world, he realized the wreck of his fortune, assembled some score of his most faithful companions, and one day disappeared, leaving no trace behind."
"那么，他到哪里去寻找在人间找不到的自由了呢？在波浪下，在深海中，在人们找不到的地方。","Where, then, did he seek that liberty denied him upon the inhabited earth?Under the waves, in the depths of the ocean, where none could follow."
"这位勇士变成了一位科学家。他在太平洋一个荒岛上建立了造船所，然后按照他的设计建造了一艘潜水船。他利用了一种未来会被人们发现的方法来有效地利用了无穷的电力。电的来源取之不尽，他用电供应他的浮力装置所需，并且作为动力、照明和发热的工具。大海有数不清的宝藏，有无数的鱼类、无数的海藻和庞大的哺乳动物。大海里不仅有大自然供应的一切，而且还有人类丢在海底的东西。这些宝藏充分满足了王子和他的同伴们的需要。于是他最热心的渴求实现了，他再也不和外界联系了。他给他的潜水船命名为“诺第留斯号”，他自称尼摩船长，消失在海底。","The warrior became the man of science.Upon a deserted island of the Pacific he established his dockyard, and there a submarine vessel was constructed from his designs.By methods which will at some future day be revealed he had rendered subservient the illimitable forces of electricity, which, extracted from inexhaustible sources, was employed for all the requirements of his floating equipage, as a moving, lighting, and heating agent.The sea, with its countless treasures, its myriads of fish, its numberless wrecks, its enormous mammalia, and not only all that nature supplied, but also all that man had lost in its depths, sufficed for every want of the prince and his crew—and thus was his most ardent desire accomplished, never again to hold communication with the earth.He named his submarine vessel the “Nautilus,” called himself simply Captain Nemo, and disappeared beneath the seas."
"多年以来，这个怪人从南极到北极，游遍了各个大洋。作为被人世间遗弃的人，他在这些未知的地方搜集到无数的珍宝。1702年，西班牙的大帆船在维哥湾丧失的数百万财产成了他用之不尽的财富。他常常用这笔财富匿名资助那些为民族独立而斗争的国家。","During many years this strange being visited every ocean, from pole to pole.Outcast of the inhabited earth in these unknown worlds he gathered incalculable treasures.The millions lost in the Bay of Vigo, in 1702, by the galleons of Spain, furnished him with a mine of inexhaustible riches which he devoted always, anonymously, in favor of those nations who fought for the independence of their country."
"（这指的是干地奥提人的起义，他们很大程度上得到了尼摩船长的资助。）","(This refers to the resurrection of the Candiotes, who were, in fact, largely assisted by Captain Nemo.)"
"然而，长久以来，他一直和外界隔绝。直到1866年11月6日的夜间，有三个人来到他的船上。他们中还有一个是法国教授，一个是仆人，还有一个加拿大的渔民。这三个人是在“诺第留斯号”和美国的“亚伯拉罕·林肯号”战舰相撞时落到他的船上的，当时美国战舰正在追逐“诺第留斯号”。","For long, however, he had held no communication with his fellow-creatures, when, during the night of the 6th of November, 1866, three men were cast on board his vessel.They were a French professor, his servant, and a Canadian fisherman.These three men had been hurled overboard by a collision which had taken place between the “Nautilus” and the United States frigate “Abraham Lincoln,” which had chased her."
"尼摩船长从这位教授这里得知，“诺第留斯号”有时被人们当作庞大的鲸鱼类哺乳动物，有时被当作一支携带海盗的潜水船，人们在各个海域上搜寻它。","Captain Nemo learned from this professor that the “Nautilus,” taken now for a gigantic mammal of the whale species, now for a submarine vessel carrying a crew of pirates, was sought for in every sea."
"他本来可以把这三个人送回大洋的，是命运把他们从大洋里送到了船上，接触到他的神秘生活。他没有这么做，反而将他们当犯人一样囚禁起来。他们在这里呆了七个月，在海底航行了两万海里。他们亲眼见到了旅行中所有的奇迹。","He might have returned these three men to the ocean, from whence chance had brought them in contact with his mysterious existence.Instead of doing this he kept them prisoners, and during seven months they were enabled to behold all the wonders of a voyage of twenty thousand leagues under the sea."
"这三个人都不知道尼摩船长的历史。1867年6月22日，他们乘着“诺第留斯号”上的一只小船成功逃脱了。但是当时“诺第留斯号”在挪威海岸附近卷入了大漩涡的中心，船长很自然地认为这三个逃跑的人肯定会被可怕的漩涡卷走，丧身深海里了。他不知道那个法国人和他的两个伙伴竟然奇迹般地被抛上海岸，罗佛敦群岛上的渔民救了他们。他们回到法国后，出版了一本书，叙述了七个月来在“诺第留斯号”上惊险离奇的航海经过。这些故事出版后，一度引起广大读者的好奇心。","One day, the 22nd of June, 1867, these three men, who knew nothing of the past history of Captain Nemo, succeeded in escaping in one of the “Nautilus’s” boats.But as at this time the “Nautilus” was drawn into the vortex of the maelstrom, off the coast of Norway, the captain naturally believed that the fugitives, engulfed in that frightful whirlpool, found their death at the bottom of the abyss.He was unaware that the Frenchman and his two companions had been miraculously cast on shore, that the fishermen of the Lofoten Islands had rendered them assistance, and that the professor, on his return to France, had published that work in which seven months of the strange and eventful navigation of the “Nautilus” were narrated and exposed to the curiosity of the public."
"这件事情发生后的很长一段时间里，尼摩船长继续游历于各个海洋之中。但是，他的同伴一个个相继死去，在太平洋的珊瑚礁上找到了长眠之地。后来，这群生活在深海的人只剩下尼摩船长一位孤独的幸存者。","For a long time alter this, Captain Nemo continued to live thus, traversing every sea.But one by one his companions died, and found their last resting-place in their cemetery of coral, in the bed of the Pacific.At last Captain Nemo remained the solitary survivor of all those who had taken refuge with him in the depths of the ocean."
"这时候他已经六十岁了。虽然孤身一人，他还是成功将“诺第留斯号”开进了海底的一个石洞，过去他常常把这样的石洞当作港湾。","He was now sixty years of age.Although alone, he succeeded in navigating the “Nautilus” towards one of those submarine caverns which had sometimes served him as a harbor."
"这些港口中，有一个就在林肯岛的海底下，当时它已成为“诺第留斯号”的藏身之处。","One of these ports was hollowed beneath Lincoln Island, and at this moment furnished an asylum to the “Nautilus.”"
"船长在尼摩岛已经住了六个年头。他已经不再航海，而是静静等待死亡。那时候他应该重新回到他昔日的伙伴之中去了，也是在那时，他偶然看到载着南方军的俘虏的气球从天空降落下来。他穿着潜水衣在离岛的海岸几锚链的海底行走，这时工程师正好掉到海里。在同情心的驱使下，船长救了塞勒斯·哈丁。","The captain had now remained there six years, navigating the ocean no longer, but awaiting death, and that moment when he should rejoin his former companions, when by chance he observed the descent of the balloon which carried the prisoners of the Confederates.Clad in his diving dress he was walking beneath the water at a few cables’ length from the shore of the island, when the engineer had been thrown into the sea.Moved by a feeling of compassion the captain saved Cyrus Harding."
"他最开始的想法就是远离这五个掉下来的人。但是玄武岩由于火山的影响升出了水面，堵住了他避难的海港，他再也不能从地窟穿行了。虽然水的深度可以让轻便的小船穿出洞口，但是却不能满足“诺第留斯号”进出，因为它吃水很深。","His first impulse was to fly from the vicinity of the five castaways; but his harbor refuge was closed, for in consequence of an elevation of the basalt, produced by the influence of volcanic action, he could no longer pass through the entrance of the vault.Though there was sufficient depth of water to allow a light craft to pass the bar, there was not enough for the “Nautilus,” whose draught of water was considerable."
"因此，尼摩船长只得留下来。他偷偷观察着这些被扔到荒岛上一无所有的人们，但是他不愿意让他们发现自己。后来，当他看到这些人很诚实、充满活力又彼此关爱时，他开始对他们的努力产生兴趣。他不由自主地了解了他们所有的秘密。穿上潜水衣，他可以很容易到达花岗石宫内部的井底，沿着凸出的岩石爬到上面的井口处。他听到他们回忆往事，讨论现在和将来。他从他们那里得知，美国国内因为废除奴隶制的问题爆发了大规模的内战。这些人在岛上表现出来的崇高行为值得尼摩船长改变对人的看法。","Captain Nemo was compelled, therefore, to remain.He observed these men thrown without resources upon a desert island, but had no wish to be himself discovered by them.By degrees he became interested in their efforts when he saw them honest, energetic, and bound to each other by the ties of friendship.As if despite his wishes, he penetrated all the secrets of their existence.By means of the diving dress he could easily reach the well in the interior of Granite House, and climbing by the projections of rock to its upper orifice he heard the colonists as they recounted the past, and studied the present and future.He learned from them the tremendous conflict of America with America itself, for the abolition of slavery.Yes, these men were worthy to reconcile Captain Nemo with that humanity which they represented so nobly in the island."
"尼摩船长救了赛勒斯·哈丁。他把托普从湖里救出来，又把它带回“石窟”。他在箱子里放了很多对他们很有用的东西放在遗物角，把平底船送回慈悲河。在大猩猩进攻花岗石宫的时候，他把绳梯从上面扔下来，把纸条装在瓶子里，好让他们知道艾尔顿在达抱岛上，把水雷放在海峡底下，引起海峡底下，引起双桅船的爆炸。他还给他们送酸奎宁，把赫伯特从死亡边缘挽救回来。最后，他还用电弹打死了罪犯，他掌握这种电弹的秘密，用它来猎捕海底动物的。这样，许多看似神奇的事情就解释清楚了。这一切都证明了船长的慷慨和才能。","Captain Nemo had saved Cyrus Harding.It was he also who had brought back the dog to the Chimneys, who rescued Top from the waters of the lake, who caused to fall at Flotsam Point the case containing so many things useful to the colonists, who conveyed the canoe back into the stream of the Mercy, who cast the cord from the top of Granite House at the time of the attack by the baboons, who made known the presence of Ayrton upon Tabor Island, by means of the document enclosed in the bottle, who caused the explosion of the brig by the shock of a torpedo placed at the bottom of the canal, who saved Herbert from certain death by bringing the sulphate of quinine; and finally, it was he who had killed the convicts with the electric balls, of which he possessed the secret, and which he employed in the chase of submarine creatures.Thus were explained so many apparently supernatural occurrences, and which all proved the generosity and power of the captain."
"然而，这位厌恶人类的贵族愿意给他保护的人们更多的贡献。他还要给他们提出有用的建议。然而，他的心跳逐渐微弱，已经接近死亡。就像我们所知道的那样，他用一根从畜栏通到诺第留斯号的电线，把花岗石宫的人们邀请到这里来。要是他早知道塞勒斯·哈丁知道他的历史，用尼摩船长称呼他，也许他就不会邀请他们来了。","Nevertheless, this noble misanthrope longed to benefit his proteges still further.There yet remained much useful advice to give them, and, his heart being softened by the approach of death, he invited, as we are aware, the colonists of Granite House to visit the “Nautilus,” by means of a wire which connected it with the corral.Possibly he would not have done this had he been aware that Cyrus Harding was sufficiently acquainted with his history to address him by the name of Nemo."
"船长对他的一生做了一个总结。然后赛勒斯·哈丁开口讲话了。他回忆了过去发生的事情，这些事情给了他们极大的帮助。他以大家和自己的名义向这位慷慨的恩人表示感谢。","The captain concluded the narrative of his life.Cyrus Harding then spoke; he recalled all the incidents which had exercised so beneficent an influence upon the colony, and in the names of his companions and himself thanked the generous being to whom they owed so much."
"但是尼摩船长并不关心这些。他的思绪似乎被一个想法吸引着，他没有握工程师伸过来的手。","But Captain Nemo paid little attention; his mind appeared to be absorbed by one idea, and without taking the proffered hand of the engineer,—"
"“现在，先生，您现在知道我的历史了，您来评判一下吧！”","“Now, sir,” said he, “now that you know my history, your judgment!”"
"说到这，船长显然是暗示一件重要的事，就是落在他船上的三个陌生人亲眼看到的事情。这件事，那个法国教授把它写进了书里，引起了深远而可怕的影响。在教授和他的两个同伴逃脱前不久，“诺第留斯号”在北大西洋受到一艘巡洋舰的追逐，最后它像一只攻城车，一样毫不留情地把巡洋舰撞沉了。","In saying this, the captain evidently alluded to an important incident witnessed by the three strangers thrown on board his vessel, and which the French professor had related in his work, causing a profound and terrible sensation.Some days previous to the flight of the professor and his two companions, the “Nautilus,” being chased by a frigate in the north of the Atlantic had hurled herself as a ram upon this frigate, and sunk her without mercy."
"赛勒斯·哈丁明白船长的暗示，他沉默了。","Cyrus Harding understood the captain’s allusion, and was silent."
"“那是敌人的巡洋舰，”尼摩船长大声喊道，这一刻，他又变成达卡王子了，“是敌人的巡洋舰！是它先攻击我的——我被挤在一个狭窄的海湾里——巡洋舰挡住了我的去路，于是，我就把它击沉了！”","“It was an enemy’s frigate,” exclaimed Captain Nemo, transformed for an instant into the Prince Dakkar, “an enemy’s frigate!It was she who attacked me—I was in a narrow and shallow bay—the frigate barred my way—and I sank her!”"
"接着，他沉默了一会儿接着说：","A few moments of silence ensued; then the captain demanded,—"
"“先生，您是怎么看待我的一生的？”","“What think you of my life, gentlemen?”"
"赛勒斯·哈丁向昔日的王子伸出了手，严肃地回答道：“先生，您的错误在于，您认为过去的事情可以重来，与必然的进步抗争。对于这样的错误，有人赞美，有人指责，但只有上帝才能评判是非。一个错误地坚持自己信仰的人可能是我们的敌人，但他仍然会得到我们的尊重。您的错误是我们所崇敬的，您的名字丝毫不畏惧历史的评判。历史从不谴责英雄的荒唐之事，只会谴责它所带来的后果。”","Cyrus Harding extended his hand to the ci-devant prince and replied gravely, “Sir, your error was in supposing that the past can be resuscitated, and in contending against inevitable progress.It is one of those errors which some admire, others blame; which God alone can judge.He who is mistaken in an action which he sincerely believes to be right may be an enemy, but retains our esteem.Your error is one that we may admire, and your name has nothing to fear from the judgment of history, which does not condemn heroic folly, but its results.”"
"这位老人的胸膛激动地起伏着，他抬起手指向天空——","The old man’s breast swelled with emotion, and raising his hand to heaven,—"
"“那我是错还是对呢？”他喃喃地说。","“Was I wrong, or in the right?” he murmured."
"赛勒斯·哈丁回答：“所有伟大的行动都来自上帝，又回归上帝。尼摩船长，您拯救了我们，我们会永远怀念您的。”","Cyrus Harding replied, “All great actions return to God, from whom they are derived.Captain Nemo, we, whom you have succored, shall ever mourn your loss.”"
"赫伯特走近船长，跪下身来，亲吻他的手。","Herbert, who had drawn near the captain, fell on his knees and kissed his hand."
"这个奄奄一息的老人眼里闪着泪水。“我的孩子，”他说，“愿上帝保佑你！”","A tear glistened in the eyes of the dying man.“My child,” he said, “may God bless you!”"
"第十七章","Chapter 17"
"白天来临了。但是光线丝毫照不到洞窟的深处。这时候正在涨潮，堵住了洞窟口。但是，从“诺第留斯号”的天窗里射出去的一束长长的人造光和原来一样光彩熠熠，浮船周围碧波闪闪。","Day had returned.No ray of light penetrated into the profundity of the cavern.It being high-water, the entrance was closed by the sea.But the artificial light, which escaped in long streams from the skylights of the “Nautilus” was as vivid as before, and the sheet of water shone around the floating vessel."
"尼摩船长躺回到沙发上，十分疲倦。把他搬到花岗石宫的想法是没用的，因为他早已表达过他的心愿，那就是留在“诺第留斯号”上和那些无价之宝呆在一起，等待即将到来的死亡。","An extreme exhaustion now overcame Captain Nemo, who had fallen back upon the divan.It was useless to contemplate removing him to Granite House, for he had expressed his wish to remain in the midst of those marvels of the “Nautilus” which millions could not have purchased, and to wait there for that death which was swiftly approaching."
"经过很长一段时间的虚脱，他几乎完全失去了知觉。赛勒斯·哈丁和吉迪恩·史佩莱小心地观察这个垂死之人的状况。很明显，他的体力在渐渐衰退。他的身躯，曾经一度强壮，然而此刻，却成了一个安放即将逝去的灵魂的脆弱的躯壳。他的全部生命力都集中在心脏和头脑里。","During a long interval of prostration, which rendered him almost unconscious, Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett attentively observed the condition of the dying man.It was apparent that his strength was gradually diminishing.That frame, once so robust, was now but the fragile tenement of a departing soul.All of life was concentrated in the heart and head."
"工程师和通讯记者低声商量了一下。还能为这个垂死的人做些什么吗？即使不能救他的命，能不能让他多活几天呢？尼摩船长说过自己的病已是回天乏术了，他毫不畏惧地、平静地等待着死亡。","The engineer and reporter consulted in whispers.Was it possible to render any aid to the dying man?Might his life, if not saved, be prolonged for some days?He himself had said that no remedy could avail, and he awaited with tranquillity that death which had for him no terrors."
"“我们什么也做不了。”吉迪恩·史佩莱说。","“We can do nothing,” said Gideon Spilett."
"“可是，是什么把他推向了死亡？”潘克洛夫问。","“But of what is he dying?” asked Pencroft."
"“生命自然而然衰退了。”通讯记者回答道。","“Life is simply fading out,” replied the reporter."
"“不过，”水手说，“要是我们把他挪到外面，让他晒晒太阳，呼吸一下新鲜空气，他或许就康复了。”","“Nevertheless,” said the sailor, “if we move him into the open air, and the light of the sun, he might perhaps recover.”"
"“不，潘克洛夫，”工程师答道，“这些尝试都没用。况且，尼摩船长绝不会同意离开他的船。他已经在‘诺第留斯’号生活了三十年，他也希望死在这里。”","“No, Pencroft,” answered the engineer, “it is useless to attempt it.Besides, Captain Nemo would never consent to leave his vessel.He has lived for a dozen years on board the ‘Nautilus,’ and on board the ‘Nautilus’ he desires to die.”"
"毫无疑问，尼摩船长一定听到了塞勒斯·哈丁的回答，他轻轻抬起了身子，用更加微弱但始终清楚的声音说道：","Without doubt Captain Nemo heard Cyrus Harding’s reply, for he raised himself slightly, and in a voice more feeble, but always intelligible,—"
"“你说的对，先生，”他说，“我要死在这里……这是我的愿望。因此，我对你有一个请求。”","“You are right, sir,” he said.“I shall die here—it is my wish; and therefore I have a request to make of you.”"
"赛勒斯·哈丁和他的伙伴都凑到长沙发边上来了。他们把坐垫调到舒适的位置，好让这个垂死的人更舒服些。","Cyrus Harding and his companions had drawn near the divan, and now arranged the cushions in such a manner as to better support the dying man."
"他们看到他的眼睛在大厅里的珍宝间游离，电灯的光线透过天花板上的花玻璃照亮了整个大厅。他依次观察着隔板上的美丽挂毯上的图画，那些图画出自意大利、佛兰达斯、法国和西班牙顶级画家之手；雕像座上的大理石像和铜像；‪靠着隔板后半部分华丽的风琴；养着最为珍奇水生生物的鱼缸——里面有海藻、植虫、极其名贵的珍珠项圈；最后，他的目光停留在这个博物馆的人字墙上，上面刻着题铭，那是“诺第留斯号”的一句箴言：","They saw his eyes wander over all the marvels of this saloon, lighted by the electric rays which fell from the arabesques of the luminous ceiling.He surveyed, one after the other, the pictures hanging from the splendid tapestries of the partitions, the chef-d’oeuvres of the Italian, Flemish, French, and Spanish masters; the statues of marble and bronze on their pedestals; the magnificent organ, leaning against the after-partition; the aquarium, in which bloomed the most wonderful productions of the sea—marine plants, zoophytes, chaplets of pearls of inestimable value; and, finally, his eyes rested on this device, inscribed over the pediment of the museum—the motto of the “Nautilus”—"
"“动中之动。”","“Mobilis in mobile.”"
"他眼神中透露出喜爱之情，最后一次停留在这些艺术和自然的珍品上。多年来，他居住在大海深处，他的目光也仅限于这些珍品。","His glance seemed to rest fondly for the last time on these masterpieces of art and of nature, to which he had limited his horizon during a sojourn of so many years in the abysses of the seas."
"赛勒斯·哈丁尊重船长，并没有打扰他的沉思，而是等待他开口说话。","Cyrus Harding respected the captain’s silence, and waited till he should speak."
"几分钟后，毫无疑问，这几分钟里，他回顾了自己的一生，尼摩船长转过身来对移民们说：","After some minutes, during which, doubtless, he passed in review his whole life, Captain Nemo turned to the colonists and said,"
"“各位先生，你们认为对我负有什么义务吗？”","“You consider yourselves, gentlemen, under some obligations to me?”"
"“船长，相信我们，我们愿意用我们的生命来延长您的生命。”","“Captain, believe us that we would give our lives to prolong yours.”"
"“那么，答应我，”尼摩船长接着说，“帮我实现最后的愿望，你们就算报答了我为你们所做的一切了。”","“Promise, then,” continued Captain Nemo, “to carry out my last wishes, and I shall be repaid for all I have done for you.”"
"“我们答应。”赛勒斯·哈丁说。","“We promise,” said Cyrus Harding."
"这个许诺把他自己和伙伴们都包括在内了。","And by this promise he bound both himself and his companions."
"“先生们，”船长继续说，“明天我就要死了。”","“Gentlemen,” resumed the captain, “to-morrow I shall be dead.”"
"赫伯特正要喊出声，船长做了一个手势，阻止了他。","Herbert was about to utter an exclamation, but a sign from the captain arrested him."
"“明天我就要死了，我不需要其他坟墓，只求留在‘诺第留斯号’上，这就是我的坟墓！我所有的朋友们都长眠于大海的深处，他们安息之地亦是我安息之地。”","“To-morrow I shall die, and I desire no other tomb than the ‘Nautilus.’ It is my grave!All my friends repose in the depths of the ocean; their resting-place shall be mine.”"
"大家安静地听着这些话。","These words were received with profound silence."
"“请尊重我的意愿，”他接着说，“‘诺第留斯号’困在这个洞穴里，洞穴的出口堵住了。但是，虽然没有办法出去，至少船沉在这个深渊里，可以埋葬我的遗骨。”","“Pay attention to my wishes,” he continued.“The ‘Nautilus’ is imprisoned in this grotto, the entrance of which is blocked up; but, although egress is impossible, the vessel may at least sink in the abyss, and there bury my remains.”"
"移民们恭敬地听着这位垂死的人的话。","The colonists listened reverently to the words of the dying man."
"“哈丁先生，明天我死了之后，”船长继续说道，“你和你的伙伴们就离开‘诺第留斯号’，让所有珍宝同我一起消亡。达卡王子的历史你们已经知道了，我只留给你们一样东西。那边的保险箱里装着价值连城的钻石。大部分都是我作为丈夫和父亲时候的纪念品，当时我认为很有乐趣。里面还有一些我和我的朋友们在深海中搜集到的珍珠。将来你们可以好好利用这些珍宝。在像您和您的伙伴这样的人手中，哈丁船长，钱不会成为罪恶的源泉。升天后我还会参加你们的事业，我相信你们的事业会繁荣发展起来。”","“To-morrow, after my death, Mr. Harding,” continued the captain, “yourself and companions will leave the ‘Nautilus,’ for all the treasures it contains must perish with me.One token alone will remain with you of Prince Dakkar, with whose history you are now acquainted.That coffer yonder contains diamonds of the value of many millions, most of them mementoes of the time when, husband and father, I thought happiness possible for me, and a collection of pearls gathered by my friends and myself in the depths of the ocean.Of this treasure at a future day, you may make good use.In the hands of such men as yourself and your comrades, Captain Harding, money will never be a source of danger.From on high I shall still participate in your enterprises, and I fear not but that they will prosper.”"
"由于极度虚弱，他稍微休息了一会儿，然后接着说：","After a few moments’ repose, necessitated by his extreme weakness, Captain Nemo continued,—"
"“明天你们把保险箱带走，离开这个大厅，关上门。然后你们登到‘诺第留斯号’的甲板上，把主舱口放下来，把船完全关好。”","“To-morrow you will take the coffer, you will leave the saloon, of which you will close the door; then you will ascend on to the deck of the ‘Nautilus,’ and you will lower the mainhatch so as entirely to close the vessel.”"
"“我们会这样做的，船长。”赛勒斯·哈丁回答。","“It shall be done, captain,” answered Cyrus Harding."
"“很好。然后你们就登上来时乘坐的那只小船。但是，在离开‘诺第留斯号’之前，先到船尾把吃水线上的两个大活塞打开。海水灌进贮水槽后，‘诺第留斯号’就会逐渐沉到水底，躺在大海的深处了。”","“Good.You will then embark in the canoe which brought you hither; but, before leaving the ‘Nautilus,’ go to the stern and there open two large stop-cocks which you will find upon the water-line.The water will penetrate into the reservoirs, and the ‘Nautilus’ will gradually sink beneath the water to repose at the bottom of the abyss.”"
"船长理解了赛勒斯·哈丁的表情，接着补充道：","And comprehending a gesture of Cyrus Harding, the captain added,—"
"“没有什么可害怕的！你们只不过是埋葬一具尸体而已！”","“Fear nothing!You will but bury a corpse!”"
"赛勒斯·哈丁和他的同伴们都没有敢向尼摩船长提出任何建议。船长已经说出了最后的心愿，他们除了照办，别无其他事情可做。","Neither Cyrus Harding nor his companions ventured to offer any observation to Captain Nemo.He had expressed his last wishes, and they had nothing to do but to conform to them."
"“你们答应我了是吗，先生们？”尼摩船长又问道。","“I have your promise, gentlemen?” added Captain Nemo."
"“是的，船长。”工程师回答。","“You have, captain,” replied the engineer."
"船长打了一个手势，向这些移民表示感谢，并且请求让他自己呆几个小时。吉迪恩·史佩莱想在他身旁陪他以防万一，但是这位垂死的人拒绝了。他说：“我能活到明天，先生。”","The captain thanked the colonists by a sign, and requested them to leave him for some hours.Gideon Spilett wished to remain near him, in the event of a crisis coming on, but the dying man refused, saying, “I shall live until to-morrow, sir.”"
"大家离开大厅，经过书房和餐厅，来到前面的机房。机房里装有电动仪器，这套仪器不仅供应光热用电，还为“诺第留斯号”提供机械动力。","All left the saloon, passed through the library and the dining-room, and arrived forward, in the machine-room where the electrical apparatus was established, which supplied not only heat and light, but the mechanical power of the “Nautilus.”"
"“诺第留斯号”是一个杰作，而其内部又包含着许多杰作。工程师惊呆了。","The “Nautilus” was a masterpiece containing masterpieces with itself, and the engineer was struck with astonishment."
"移民们登上平台，平台高出水平面七八英尺。在那里，他们发现了一块厚厚的玻璃凸透镜，里面有一个大圆孔，亮光从凸透镜里射出去。圆孔后面很明显是装舵轮的仓库。当舵手驾驶“诺第留斯号”在海底航行时，就可以在这里操控方向。并且，电灯的光线可以照得很远。","The colonists mounted the platform, which rose seven or eight feet above the water.There they beheld a thick glass lenticular covering, which protected a kind of large eye, from which flashed forth light.Behind this eye was apparently a cabin containing the wheels of the rudder, and in which was stationed the helmsman, when he navigated the “Nautilus” over the bed of the ocean, which the electric rays would evidently light up to a considerable distance."
"赛勒斯·哈丁和他的伙伴们沉默了一会儿，刚才所看到和听到的都给他们留下了深刻的印象。一想到他们和这个多次帮助他们的人认识了只有几个小时，现在他就在死亡的边缘，他们的心被深深地触动了。","Cyrus Harding and his companions remained for a time silent, for they were vividly impressed by what they had just seen and heard, and their hearts were deeply touched by the thought that he whose arm had so often aided them, the protector whom they had known but a few hours, was at the point of death."
"无论后人如何评判这个传奇人物和他于人类生活之外的一生，达卡王子的形象都会永远留在记忆深处，不会褪去。","Whatever might be the judgment pronounced by posterity upon the events of this, so to speak, extra-human existence, the character of Prince Dakkar would ever remain as one of those whose memory time can never efface."
"“多么了不起的一个人！”潘克洛夫说，“有没有可能他曾在海底生活？我觉得也许他在那儿得到的宁静也不会比别处多多少！”","“What a man!” said Pencroft.“Is it possible that he can have lived at the bottom of the sea?And it seems to me that perhaps he has not found peace there any more than elsewhere!”"
"“‘诺第留斯号’，”艾尔顿说，“可能能带我们离开林肯岛，到有人居住的地方去。”","“The ‘Nautilus,’” observed Ayrton, “might have enabled us to leave Lincoln Island and reach some inhabited country.”"
"“天啊！”潘克洛夫喊道，“我绝不会冒险坐这样的船。在海上航行还可以，但是在海下，我决不干！”","“Good Heavens!” exclaimed Pencroft, “I for one would never risk myself in such a craft.To sail on the seas, good, but under the seas, never!”"
"“我相信，潘克洛夫，”通讯记者回答道，“驾驶像‘诺第留斯号’这样的潜水船应该很容易。我们应该很快就能熟悉它的习性。海底既没有风暴，也不必担心撞船。在水面下几英尺的地方，海水和湖水一样平静。”","“I believe, Pencroft,” answered the reporter, “that the navigation of a submarine vessel such as the ‘Nautilus’ ought to be very easy, and that we should soon become accustomed to it.There would be no storms, no lee-shore to fear.At some feet beneath the surface the waters of the ocean are as calm as those of a lake.”"
"“也许可能，”水手回答说，“但是我宁愿冒着狂风乘一支装备齐全的船航行。船应该在海面上航行，而不是海底。”","“That may be,” replied the sailor, “but I prefer a gale of wind on board a well-found craft.A vessel is built to sail on the sea, and not beneath it.”"
"“我的朋友们，”工程师说，“讨论也没用，至少不用讨论‘诺第留斯号’的问题。‘诺第留斯号’不是我们的，我们没有权利处理它。并且我们也不能驾驶它。现在的事实是，‘诺第留斯号’根本驶不出洞外，因为洞窟的出口已经被上升的玄武岩堵死了。尼摩船长的愿望是想和它一起被埋葬。他的愿望就是我们的法律，我们一定要帮他实现。”","“My friends,” said the engineer, “it is useless, at any rate as regards the ‘Nautilus,’ to discuss the question of submarine vessels.The ‘Nautilus’ is not ours, and we have not the right to dispose of it.Moreover, we could in no case avail ourselves of it.Independently of the fact that it would be impossible to get it out of this cavern, whose entrance is now closed by the uprising of the basaltic rocks, Captain Nemo’s wish is that it shall be buried with him.His wish is our law, and we will fulfil it.”"
"一段长时间的谈话后，赛勒斯·哈丁和他的伙伴们到了“诺第留斯号”的内部。他们在那里吃了一些东西，又回到大厅里了。","After a somewhat prolonged conversation, Cyrus Harding and his companions again descended to the interior of the “Nautilus.”There they took some refreshment and returned to the saloon."
"尼摩船长已经从虚脱状态中恢复过来了，他的眼睛发出原有的光芒。他的嘴角甚至露出了一丝微笑。","Captain Nemo had somewhat rallied from the prostration which had overcome him, and his eyes shone with their wonted fire.A faint smile even curled his lips."
"移民们围坐在他身边。","The colonists drew around him."
"“先生们，”船长说，“你们是既勇敢又诚实的人。你们为共同的福祉奉献着。我常常观察你们的行为。过去我尊敬你们，现在仍然尊重你们！把您的手递给我，哈丁先生。”","“Gentlemen,” said the captain, “you are brave and honest men.You have devoted yourselves to the common weal.Often have I observed your conduct.I have esteemed you—I esteem you still!Your hand, Mr. Harding.”"
"赛勒斯·哈丁把手伸向船长，船长热情地握住他的手。","Cyrus Harding gave his hand to the captain, who clasped it affectionately."
"“很好！”他轻声说道。","“It is well!” he murmured."
"他接着说道：","He resumed,—"
"“关于我的事已经说得够多了。我该谈谈你们和你们现在居住的林肯岛的问题了。你们现在想离开这个岛吗？”","“But enough of myself.I have to speak concerning yourselves, and this Lincoln Island, upon which you have taken refuge.You now desire to leave it?”"
"“我们还会再回来的，船长！”潘克洛夫很快地说。","“To return, captain!” answered Pencroft quickly."
"“还会再回来吗，潘克洛夫？”船长面带微笑地说着。“我知道，真的，我知道你对这个岛的热爱。由于你们的帮助，这个岛才成了现在这个样子。这个岛对于你们来说是个天堂！”","“To return, Pencroft?” said the captain, with a smile.“I know, it is true, your love for this island.You have helped to make it what it now is, and it seems to you a paradise!”"
"“船长，我们的计划是，”塞勒斯·哈丁打断说，“我们打算让这个岛隶属于美国，它在太平洋的位置极为重要，我们要建立一个海港。”","“Our project, captain,” interposed Cyrus Harding, “is to annex it to the United States, and to establish for our shipping a port so fortunately situated in this part of the Pacific.”"
"“你们在为你们的祖国考虑，先生们，”船长接着说，“你们的劳动是为了国家的繁荣和荣誉。你们是对的。一个人就应该在自己的祖国生活，在自己的祖国死去！而我却只能远离故土、客死异乡了。”","“Your thoughts are with your country, gentlemen,” continued the captain; “your toils are for her prosperity and glory.You are right.One’s native land!—there should one live! there die!And I die far from all I loved!”"
"“您还有什么最后的心愿要转达，”工程师激动地说，“有什么纪念品要送给您留在印度深山中的朋友吗？”","“You have some last wish to transmit,” said the engineer with emotion, “some souvenir to send to those friends you have left in the mountains of India?”"
"“没有了，哈丁船长。我没有什么朋友了！我是我们这一群人中最后一个，我认识的人都以为我早死了。——还是回到你们的话题吧。孤独与与世隔绝是痛苦的，没有谁能够忍受得了。我曾经认为可以独自生活！因此，你们应该尝试一切办法离开林肯岛，重新回到生养你们的故乡。我注意到那些坏蛋已经把你们造的船毁掉了。”","“No, Captain Harding; no friends remain to me!I am the last of my race, and to all whom I have known I have long been as are the dead.—But to return to yourselves.Solitude, isolation, are painful things, and beyond human endurance.I die of having thought it possible to live alone!You should, therefore, dare all in the attempt to leave Lincoln Island, and see once more the land of your birth.I am aware that those wretches have destroyed the vessel you have built.”"
"“我们打算造一只船，”吉迪恩·史佩莱说，“大到足以把我们送到最近的陆地上的船。假使我们成功了，早晚我们还是会回到林肯岛。我们眷恋这个地方，因为这里有许多无法抹去的记忆。”“其中就包括在这里我们认识了尼摩船长。”塞勒斯·哈丁说。","“We propose to construct a vessel,” said Gideon Spilett, “sufficiently large to convey us to the nearest land; but if we should succeed, sooner or later we shall return to Lincoln Island.We are attached to it by too many recollections ever to forget it.”“It is here that we have known Captain Nemo,” said Cyrus Harding."
"“这是我们唯一能建造家园的地方！”赫伯特补充说道。","“It is here only that we can make our home!” added Herbert."
"“我要长眠于此，如果……”船长说道。","“And here shall I sleep the sleep of eternity, if—” replied the captain."
"他没有把话说完，停顿了一会儿后，他简单地说道：","He paused for a moment, and, instead of completing the sentence, said simply,—"
"“哈丁先生，我想和您……单独说几句话！”","“Mr. Harding, I wish to speak with you—alone!”"
"工程师的伙伴们尊重他的愿望，都出去了。","The engineer’s companions, respecting the wish, retired."
"赛勒斯·哈丁只和尼摩船长单独呆了几分钟，很快就把伙伴们叫进来。但是这位垂死之人跟他吐露的秘密，他却只字未提。","Cyrus Harding remained but a few minutes alone with Captain Nemo, and soon recalled his companions; but he said nothing to them of the private matters which the dying man had confided to him."
"吉迪恩·史佩莱十分精心地照顾着船长。很明显，他的精力已经严重不足，没有力量与虚弱的身体抗争了。","Gideon Spilett now watched the captain with extreme care.It was evident that he was no longer sustained by his moral energy, which had lost the power of reaction against his physical weakness."
"这一天过去了，没有发生什么变化。移民们一刻也没有离开“诺第留斯号”。夜晚降临了，虽然洞窟里分不清黑夜与白昼。","The day closed without change.The colonists did not quit the “Nautilus” for a moment.Night arrived, although it was impossible to distinguish it from day in the cavern."
"尼摩船长并没有觉得痛苦，但是很明显，他的身体在逐步衰退。由于临近死亡，他那高贵的面容变得苍白，但他十分平静。他嘴里不时发出一些分辨不清的话语，说的是他遇到的各种经历。显然，他的生命在慢慢逝去，四肢已经发冷了。","Captain Nemo suffered no pain, but he was visibly sinking.His noble features, paled by the approach of death, were perfectly calm.Inaudible words escaped at intervals from his lips, bearing upon various incidents of his checkered career.Life was evidently ebbing slowly and his extremities were already cold."
"他不时地和站在身旁的移民说话，冲他们微笑，这一丝的微笑一直保持到他死后。","Once or twice more he spoke to the colonists who stood around him, and smiled on them with that last smile which continues after death."
"最后，午夜刚过，尼摩船长竭尽全力把两臂交叉在胸前，好像打算在死后保持这个姿势一样。","At length, shortly after midnight, Captain Nemo by a supreme effort succeeded in folding his arms across his breast, as if wishing in that attitude to compose himself for death."
"一点钟的时候，只有他的眼神里还有一点生气。曾经明亮的眼眸中现在闪现了垂死的光芒。然后，他喃喃地低语：“上帝，我的祖国！”说完就安静地死去了。","By one o’clock his glance alone showed signs of life.A dying light gleamed in those eyes once so brilliant.Then, murmuring the words, “God and my country!” he quietly expired."
"赛勒斯·哈丁，弯下腰为他合上眼睛。这位昔日的达卡王子，如今却连尼摩船长也不是了。","Cyrus Harding, bending low closed the eyes of him who had once been the Prince Dakkar, and was now not even Captain Nemo."
"赫伯特和潘克洛夫大声地啜泣。艾尔顿也流下了泪水。纳布像一尊雕塑似的，一动不动地跪在通讯记者身旁。","Herbert and Pencroft sobbed aloud.Tears fell from Ayrton’s eyes.Neb was on his knees by the reporter’s side, motionless as a statue."
"然后，赛勒斯·哈丁把手放在死者的头上，庄严地说：“愿他的灵魂与上帝同在！”然后，他转向他的朋友们接着说：“让我们为我们失去的人祷告吧！”","Then Cyrus Harding, extending his hand over the forehead of the dead, said solemnly, “May his soul be with God!”Turning to his friends, he added, “Let us pray for him whom we have lost!”"
"几个小时后，移民们履行了诺言，实现了船长的临终遗愿。","Some hours later the colonists fulfilled the promise made to the captain by carrying out his dying wishes."
"赛勒斯·哈丁和他的伙伴们带着装有亿万财宝的保险箱—这是恩人留给他们的唯一纪念品——离开了“诺第留斯号”。","Cyrus Harding and his companions quitted the “Nautilus,” taking with them the only memento left them by their benefactor, the coffer which contained wealth amounting to millions."
"神奇的大厅依然灯火通明，他们小心地关上厅门。他们严密地关上了通向甲板的铁门，这样“诺第留斯号”就可以保证滴水不漏。","The marvelous saloon, still flooded with light, had been carefully closed.The iron door leading on deck was then securely fastened in such a manner as to prevent even a drop of water from penetrating to the interior of the “Nautilus.”"
"然后，移民们跳上了停靠在潜水船旁边的小船。","The colonists then descended into the canoe, which was moored to the side of the submarine vessel."
"这时候，小船划到“诺第留斯号”的船尾。在那儿，吃水线附近有两个大旋塞，连接着贮水槽，以便于使船下沉。","The canoe was now brought around to the stern.There, at the water-line, were two large stop-cocks communicating with the reservoirs employed in the submersion of the vessel."
"大旋塞打开了，海水充满贮水槽。“诺第留斯号”缓慢下沉，渐渐在海面上消失了。","The stop-cocks were opened, the reservoirs filled, and the “Nautilus,” slowly sinking, disappeared beneath the surface of the lake."
"但是移民们却无法一直看着它在波涛下沉没。强烈的光芒照亮了透明的海水，洞窟逐渐变得黑暗。最后，大片的电光消失了，不一会儿，“诺第留斯号”——现在是尼摩船长的棺材——沉在海底深处了。","But the colonists were yet able to follow its descent through the waves.The powerful light it gave forth lighted up the translucent water, while the cavern became gradually obscure.At length this vast effusion of electric light faded away, and soon after the “Nautilus,” now the tomb of Captain Nemo, reposed in its ocean bed."
"第十八章","Chapter 18"
"天刚刚亮的时候，移民们又默默地回到洞窟的出口处，为了纪念尼摩船长，他们把洞窟命名为“达卡洞”。现在正是落潮的时候，他们毫不费劲地从拱形洞口下边穿过去，海水冲刷着船的右侧。","At break of day the colonists regained in silence the entrance of the cavern, to which they gave the name of “Dakkar Grotto,” in memory of Captain Nemo.It was now low-water, and they passed without difficulty under the arcade, washed on the right by the sea."
"他们把小船停在这里，小心地保护着它，使它免受波浪的冲击。为了保险起见，潘克洛夫、纳布和艾尔顿又把船拉回洞窟一侧的一个小沙滩上，船在这里没有受损的危险。","The canoe was left here, carefully protected from the waves.As additional precaution, Pencroft, Neb, and Ayrton drew it up on a little beach which bordered one of the sides of the grotto, in a spot where it could run no risk of harm."
"暴风雨在夜间停止了。最后几声低沉的雷声在西方消失了。雨住了，但是天空仍然阴云密布。总体来说，十月份是南半球春季的第一个月，但是这个月的天气看不出有好转的迹象。风向从一个罗盘方位转向另一个方位，这表明稳定的天气是没有指望了。","The storm had ceased during the night.The last low mutterings of the thunder died away in the west.Rain fell no longer, but the sky was yet obscured by clouds.On the whole, this month of October, the first of the southern spring, was not ushered in by satisfactory tokens, and the wind had a tendency to shift from one point of the compass to another, which rendered it impossible to count upon settled weather."
"赛勒斯·哈丁和他的伙伴们离开“达卡洞”，来到了畜栏。一路上，纳布和赫伯特小心地把由尼摩船长从畜栏拉到洞窟的电线收起来，也许将来会派上用场。","Cyrus Harding and his companions, on leaving Dakkar Grotto, had taken the road to the corral.On their way Neb and Herbert were careful to preserve the wire which had been laid down by the captain between the corral and the grotto, and which might at a future time be of service."
"一路上，移民们都很少讲话。10月15日夜晚发生的种种事情在他们的脑海中留下了深刻的印象。那个有效地帮助了他们的陌生人，那个他们想象中具有超自然力量的人——尼摩船长——已经不复存在了。他和他的“诺第留斯号”已经长埋于深渊中。对他们每个人来说，都觉得比以往更加孤独了。他们一度期待的力量已经不复存在了。吉迪恩·史佩莱，甚至塞勒斯·哈丁都免不了有这种感觉。因此，他们去畜栏的路上都一直保持沉默。","The colonists spoke but little on the road.The various incidents of the night of October 15th had left a profound impression on their minds.The unknown being whose influence had so effectually protected them, the man whom their imagination had endowed with supernatural powers, Captain Nemo, was no more.His “Nautilus” and he were buried in the depths of the abyss.To each one of them their existence seemed even more isolated than before.They had been accustomed to count upon the intervention of that power which existed no longer, and Gideon Spilett, and even Cyrus Harding, could not escape this impression.Thus they maintained a profound silence during their journey to the corral."
"将近早上九点的时候，移民们回到了花岗石宫。","Towards nine in the morning the colonists arrived at Granite House."
"大家原来就一致同意要积极推进造船的进程。这次，赛勒斯·哈丁在造船工作上投入了比以往更多的时间和劳动。未来是不可能预料的。显然，如果能够拥有一艘大船，可以在恶劣的天气出航，而且在必要的时候还可以供他们长期远航，那对这些移民来说，真是有极大的好处了。船造好之后，即使移民们仍不打算离开林肯岛，为了到达太平洋波利尼西亚群岛的任何一个小岛或者新西兰的海岸，他们至少也要到达达抱岛去，把关于艾尔顿的消息留在那里。这个打算是不可或缺的，因为苏格兰快艇很可能重新回到这一片海域。这一点应该高度重视，丝毫不能忽略。","It had been agreed that the construction of the vessel should be actively pushed forward, and Cyrus Harding more than ever devoted his time and labor to this object.It was impossible to divine what future lay before them.Evidently the advantage to the colonists would be great of having at their disposal a substantial vessel, capable of keeping the sea even in heavy weather, and large enough to attempt, in case of need, a voyage of some duration.Even if, when their vessel should be completed, the colonists should not resolve to leave Lincoln Island as yet, in order to gain either one of the Polynesian Archipelagoes of the Pacific or the shores of New Zealand, they might at least, sooner or later, proceed to Tabor Island, to leave there the notice relating to Ayrton.This was a precaution rendered indispensable by the possibility of the Scotch yacht reappearing in those seas, and it was of the highest importance that nothing should be neglected on this point."
"于是，工作重新开始了。赛勒斯·哈丁、潘克洛夫和艾尔顿在纳布、吉迪恩·史佩莱和赫伯特的帮助下，除非有其他必要的事情不可避免才暂时中断，其他时候都不停地工作着。新船在五个月内完工相当重要。也就是说，如果他们想在秋分暴风阻碍航行之前到达达抱岛，三月初就得把船造好。因此，工匠们一刻也不敢耽搁。并且，他们不需要制造绳索，因为‘飞快号’的绳索都完好地保存了下来，他们只需要制造船身就可以了。","The works were then resumed.Cyrus Harding, Pencroft, and Ayrton, assisted by Neb, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert, except when unavoidably called off by other necessary occupations, worked without cessation.It was important that the new vessel should be ready in five months—that is to say, by the beginning of March—if they wished to visit Tabor Island before the equinoctial gales rendered the voyage impracticable.Therefore the carpenters lost not a moment.Moreover, it was unnecessary to manufacture rigging, that of the “Speedy” having been saved entire, so that the hull only of the vessel needed to be constructed."
"1868年年底的时候，他们忙着做这项重要的工作，几乎无暇顾及其他事情。两个半月后，肋材装好了，第一批铺板也放好了。这时候已经能很明显看出赛勒斯·哈丁的设计值得赞赏，这艘船在海里一定可以很好地航行。","The end of the year 1868 found them occupied by these important labors, to the exclusion of almost all others.At the expiration of two months and a half the ribs had been set up and the first planks adjusted.It was already evident that the plans made by Cyrus Harding were admirable, and that the vessel would behave well at sea."
"潘克洛夫竭尽全力地工作，甚至其他木匠放下斧头拿起猎枪去打猎时，他都要发牢骚。无论如何，为了度过冬天，花岗石宫里必须储备一些东西。但是这并不能使潘克洛夫满意。工人们一离开造船所，这位勇敢而忠实的水手就不满意。每当这种事情发生时，他就满腹牢骚，为了发泄怨气，他就一个人干六个人的活。","Pencroft brought to the task a devouring energy, and would even grumble when one or the other abandoned the carpenter’s axe for the gun of the hunter.It was nevertheless necessary to keep up the stores of Granite House, in view of the approaching winter.But this did not satisfy Pencroft.The brave, honest sailor was not content when the workmen were not at the dockyard. when this happened he grumbled vigorously, and, by way of venting his feelings, did the work of six men."
"整个夏天，天气都非常不好。有几天，天热得无法忍受。空气里满是雷电，只有狂风暴雨过后，空气才会清爽一些。几乎没有哪天听不见远处的雷鸣声。雷鸣声不断地响，像在不停地低声咕哝一般，这正是地球的赤道地区特有的现象。","The weather was very unfavorable during the whole of the summer season.For some days the heat was overpowering, and the atmosphere, saturated with electricity, was only cleared by violent storms.It was rarely that the distant growling of the thunder could not be heard, like a low but incessant murmur, such as is produced in the equatorial regions of the globe."
"1869年1月1日刮起了特大暴风雨，岛上不时响起雷声。很多大树被闪电劈倒和击中。湖的南岸有很多高大的榆树为家禽场遮荫，其中的一棵也被劈倒了。这种现象和地心的变化有没有关联呢？大气的活动与地球内部的运动有没有什么联系呢？赛勒斯·哈丁认为是有关系的，因为暴风雨发生的同时，火山也开始有复活的迹象。","The 1st of January, 1869, was signalized by a storm of extreme violence, and the thunder burst several times over the island.Large trees were struck by the electric fluid and shattered, and among others one of those gigantic nettle-trees which had shaded the poultry-yard at the southern extremity of the lake.Had this meteor any relation to the phenomena going on in the bowels of the earth?Was there any connection between the commotion of the atmosphere and that of the interior of the earth?Cyrus Harding was inclined to think that such was the case, for the development of these storms was attended by the renewal of volcanic symptoms."
"1月3日天刚刚亮的时候，赫伯特爬上眺望岗的高地给一头野驴套缰绳的时候，发现一大团帽子形状的烟雾从火山顶上冒出。","It was on the 3rd of January that Herbert, having ascended at daybreak to the plateau of Prospect Heights to harness one of the onagers, perceived an enormous hat-shaped cloud rolling from the summit of the volcano."
"赫伯特马上告诉了移民们，移民们听到后立刻和他一起观察起富兰克林山的山顶。","Herbert immediately apprised the colonists, who at once joined him in watching the summit of Mount Franklin."
"“啊！”潘克洛夫大声叫道，“这次可不是水汽了！依我看，这个大家伙不满足只是呼吸，它还要抽烟！”","“Ah!” exclaimed Pencroft, “those are not vapors this time!It seems to me that the giant is not content with breathing; he must smoke!”"
"水手的这个比喻准确地表达了火山口发生的变化。三个月以来，火山口一直在喷水汽，水汽时而浓时而淡，但一直只是内部矿物质沸腾所引起的。但现在，水汽被浓烟所取代。浓烟像一根灰色的柱子，底部宽三百多英尺，上升到山顶上方七八百英尺的高空时，浓烟散开，呈巨大的蘑菇状。","This figure of speech employed by the sailor exactly expressed the changes going on at the mouth of the volcano.Already for three months had the crater emitted vapors more or less dense, but which were as yet produced only by an internal ebullition of mineral substances.But now the vapors were replaced by a thick smoke, rising in the form of a grayish column, more than three hundred feet in width at its base, and which spread like an immense mushroom to a height of from seven to eight hundred feet above the summit of the mountain."
"“烟囱里有火了。”吉迪恩·史佩莱说。","“The fire is in the chimney,” observed Gideon Spilett."
"“我们没法扑灭！”赫伯特接过话说。","“And we can’t put it out!” replied Herbert."
"“应该把这座火山清除掉。”纳布十分认真地说道。","“The volcano ought to be swept,” observed Neb, who spoke as if perfectly serious."
"“说得好，纳布！”潘克洛夫大声笑道，“那么，这项工作由你负责，没问题吧？”","“Well said, Neb!” cried Pencroft, with a shout of laughter; “and you’ll undertake the job, no doubt?”"
"赛勒斯·哈丁仔细观察富兰克林山里冒出来的浓烟，甚至是倾听，似乎想听到远处有隆隆声。刚才他向前走了几步，然后，他又回到同伴们跟前，说：","Cyrus Harding attentively observed the dense smoke emitted by Mount Franklin, and even listened, as if expecting to hear some distant muttering.Then, turning towards his companions, from whom he had gone somewhat apart, he said,—"
"“事实是，我的朋友们，我们不能欺骗自己，现在要发生重大的变化了。火山内部不只是沸腾状态了，而是已经着了火。毫无疑问，我们就要受到正在爆发的火山的威胁了。”","“The truth is, my friends, we must not conceal from ourselves that an important change is going forward.The volcanic substances are no longer in a state of ebullition, they have caught fire, and we are undoubtedly menaced by an approaching eruption.”"
"“那么，船长，”潘克洛夫说，“我们将会看到火山爆发。要是爆发得好，我们就为它鼓掌。我认为没有必要为这件事继续担心。","“Well, captain,” said Pencroft, “we shall witness the eruption; and if it is a good one, we’ll applaud it.I don’t see that we need concern ourselves further about the matter.”"
"“也许是吧，”赛勒斯·哈丁回答说，“因为古老的岩浆出口现在还开着。正因为如此，喷出来的岩浆迄今一直向北面流。可是……”","“It may be so,” replied Cyrus Harding, “for the ancient track of the lava is still open; and thanks to this, the crater has hitherto overflowed towards the north.And yet—”"
"“可是，既然火山爆发对我们没有任何好处，最好还是不要爆发。”通讯记者说。","“And yet, as we can derive no advantage from an eruption, it might be better it should not take place,” said the reporter."
"“谁知道呢？”水手说，“也许火山里有什么有价值的东西，要是喷出来，我们还可以好好利用一下！”","“Who knows?” answered the sailor.“Perhaps there may be some valuable substance in this volcano, which it will spout forth, and which we may turn to good account!”"
"赛勒斯·哈丁摇摇头，看那神情，好像预料到这个突如其来的现象不会有好结果似的。他不像潘克洛夫那样把火山爆发的结果看得那么轻松。即使因为火山口的位置的原因，岩浆不会直接威胁岛上的森林和已经开发的地方，但火山爆发后还是会引起其他后果。事实上，火山爆发常常会引发地震活动。而且林肯岛地质情况各种各样，一边是玄武岩，一边又成了花岗岩，北边是岩浆凝结成的岩石，南边是肥沃的土地。这些物质不可能互相紧密连接，因此有崩裂的危险。虽然因为这个原因，熔浆扩散出来可能不会造成严重的后果，但是如果由于地质结构的运动而使整个岛震动起来，后果将很严重。","Cyrus Harding shook his head with the air of a man who augured no good from the phenomenon whose development had been so sudden.He did not regard so lightly as Pencroft the results of an eruption.If the lava, in consequence of the position of the crater, did not directly menace the wooded and cultivated parts of the island, other complications might present themselves.In fact, eruptions are not unfrequently accompanied by earthquakes; and an island of the nature of Lincoln Island, formed of substances so varied, basalt on one side, granite on the other, lava on the north, rich soil on the south, substances which consequently could not be firmly attached to each other, would be exposed to the risk of disintegration.Although, therefore, the spreading of the volcanic matter might not constitute a serious danger, any movement of the terrestrial structure which should shake the island might entail the gravest consequences."
"“我好像，”艾尔顿把耳朵贴在地上听了一会儿说道，“我好像听到了低沉的隆隆声，就像一辆拉着铁条的马车发出的声音。”","“It seems to me,” said Ayrton, who had reclined so as to place his ear to the ground, “it seems to me that I can hear a dull, rumbling sound, like that of a wagon loaded with bars of iron.”"
"移民们认真地听了听，确信艾尔顿并没有搞错。隆隆的响声中还夹杂着地下的轰鸣声，两种声音一起形成了一种强的节奏，又慢慢消失，好像地球的深处经过了一阵暴风雨，又逐渐过去了一般。但是他们听不到什么所谓的爆炸声。因此可以这样下结论：水汽和浓烟可以从中央管道自由地排放出去，安全阀门很大，不容易产生震动，也不会发生爆炸。","The colonists listened with the greatest attention, and were convinced that Ayrton was not mistaken.The rumbling was mingled with a subterranean roar, which formed a sort of rinforzando, and died slowly away, as if some violent storm had passed through the profundities of the globe.But no explosion properly so termed, could be heard.It might therefore be concluded that the vapors and smoke found a free passage through the central shaft; and that the safety-valve being sufficiently large, no convulsion would be produced, no explosion was to be apprehended."
"“那么，好了！”潘克洛夫说，“我们不回去工作吗？让富兰克林山自己冒烟、轰鸣、吼叫或喷火去吧！我们没有理由在这闲耗！来吧，艾尔顿、纳布、赫伯特、哈丁队长、史佩莱先生，今天我们大家都必须开始我们的工作！我们现在要去安装内龙骨了，十二双手也不嫌多。两个月内，我们新的‘乘风破浪号’——我们还用原来的名字命名好不好？——在气球港上漂浮！因此，我们一个小时也不能浪费！”","“Well, then!” said Pencroft, “are we not going back to work?Let Mount Franklin smoke, groan, bellow, or spout forth fire and flame as much as it pleases, that is no reason why we should be idle!Come, Ayrton, Neb, Herbert, Captain Harding, Mr. Spilett, every one of us must turn to at our work to-day!We are going to place the keelson, and a dozen pair of hands would not be too many.Before two months I want our new ‘Bonadventure’—for we shall keep the old name, shall we not?—to float on the waters of Port Balloon!Therefore there is not an hour to lose!”"
"在潘克洛夫的号召下，所有移民都去造船所安装内龙骨了。内龙骨木料很厚，构成船的下部，把船身的肋材牢牢地固定在一起。这是一项艰巨的工作，每个人都参与其中。","All the colonists, their services thus requisitioned by Pencroft, descended to the dockyard, and proceeded to place the keelson, a thick mass of wood which forms the lower portion of a ship and unites firmly the timbers of the hull.It was an arduous undertaking, in which all took part."
"1月3日这一整天他们都在工作，没有再想火山的问题。再说，花岗石宫的海滩上也看不到富兰克林山。但有一两次，太阳运动的过程中，本来十分晴朗的天空却被阴影遮住了。这说明有一股浓烟从太阳和林肯岛之间经过。岸上吹的风把水汽都刮到西边去了。塞勒斯·哈丁和吉迪恩·史佩莱注意到了天空中这些阴暗的现象。他们不时地讨论着火山爆发的现象肯定在进一步发展，但是他们的工作并没有中止。但是无论从哪个角度看，船都应该尽快造好，尽量不要拖延。如果发生了变故，移民们的安全在很大程度上就可以由这艘船来保障。也许某一天这艘船会成为他们唯一的避难所也说不定。","They continued their labors during the whole of this day, the 3rd of January, without thinking further of the volcano, which could not, besides, be seen from the shore of Granite House.But once or twice, large shadows, veiling the sun, which described its diurnal arc through an extremely clear sky, indicated that a thick cloud of smoke passed between its disc and the island.The wind, blowing on the shore, carried all these vapors to the westward.Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett remarked these somber appearances, and from time to time discussed the evident progress of the volcanic phenomena, but their work went on without interruption.It was, besides, of the first importance from every point of view, that the vessel should be finished with the least possible delay.In presence of the eventualities which might arise, the safety of the colonists would be to a great extent secured by their ship.Who could tell that it might not prove some day their only refuge?"
"晚饭后，赛勒斯·哈丁、吉迪恩·史佩莱和赫伯特又登上了眺望岗的高地。天已经黑了。在昏暗的环境下可以看到火山口上升的水汽和烟雾里是否夹带了火焰或火山里喷出的白热物体。","In the evening, after supper, Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert again ascended the plateau of Prospect Heights.It was already dark, and the obscurity would permit them to ascertain if flames or incandescent matter thrown up by the volcano were mingled with the vapor and smoke accumulated at the mouth of the crater."
"“火山口着火了！”赫伯特喊道。他比同伴们都积极，第一个跑到了高地上。","“The crater is on fire!” said Herbert, who, more active than his companion, first reached the plateau."
"富兰克林山离他们大概有六英里远。现在它像一个巨大的火把，山顶被一团烟火所围绕。山顶上的浓烟夹杂着大概是岩烬和熔渣的东西，所以在黑暗的夜色中发出的光显得很微弱。但是整个岛上弥漫着红光，红光中屹立着山顶高处朦胧的树影。大片的水汽在天空中散开，使天空变得很模糊，只能依稀看到几颗星星在闪烁。","Mount Franklin, distant about six miles, now appeared like a gigantic torch, around the summit of which turned fuliginous flames.So much smoke, and possibly scoriae and cinders were mingled with them, that their light gleamed but faintly amid the gloom of the night.But a kind of lurid brilliancy spread over the island, against which stood out confusedly the wooded masses of the heights.Immense whirlwinds of vapor obscured the sky, through which glimmered a few stars."
"“变化太快了！”工程师说道。","“The change is rapid!” said the engineer."
"“这并不稀奇，”通讯记者说，“火山复活已经很久了。你大概还记得，塞勒斯，我们第一次看见冒水汽是满山寻找尼摩船长住处的时候。如果我没有记错的话，那天应该是10月15日左右。”","“That is not surprising,” answered the reporter.“The reawakening of the volcano already dates back some time.You may remember, Cyrus, that the first vapors appeared about the time we searched the sides of the mountain to discover Captain Nemo’s retreat.It was, if I mistake not, about the 15th of October.”"
"“是的，”赫伯特回答说，“两个半月以前！”","“Yes,” replied Herbert, “two months and a half ago!”"
"“地下的火已经燃烧了十个星期了，”吉迪恩·史佩莱接着说，“火山爆发到现在这个强度也不足为奇！”","“The subterranean fires have therefore been smoldering for ten weeks,” resumed Gideon Spilett, “and it is not to be wondered at that they now break out with such violence!”"
"“你觉得地面在震动？”赛勒斯·哈丁问道。","“Do not you feel a certain vibration of the soil?” asked Cyrus Harding."
"“是的，”吉迪恩·史佩莱回答说，“但是这和地震还有很大区别。”","“Yes,” replied Gideon Spilett, “but there is a great difference between that and an earthquake.”"
"“我不确定我们遭受地震的威胁了，”赛勒斯·哈丁回答说，“愿上帝保佑我们不要遭受地震！现在还不是地震，现在的震动是由于地心的火焰发热的缘故。地壳就像锅炉的外壳，大家都知道，在蒸汽的压力下，锅身就会像金属片一样发响。现在出现的就是这种情况。”","“I do not affirm that we are menaced with an earthquake,” answered Cyrus Harding, “may God preserve us from that!No; these vibrations are due to the effervescence of the central fire.The crust of the earth is simply the shell of a boiler, and you know that such a shell, under the pressure of steam, vibrates like a sonorous plate.it is this effect which is being produced at this moment.”"
"“多么美丽的火焰啊！”赫伯特喊道。","“What magnificent flames!” exclaimed Herbert."
"这时候，一串火花从火山口里喷出来。虽然隔着水汽，还是可以看到火花的亮光。弯曲的火舌和成千上万的火花飞向各个方向。有的飞出了烟雾外，驱散了烟雾，只留下一团炽热的粉末。还不时发出一连串的爆炸声，像一排在扫射的机关枪似的。","At this instant a kind of bouquet of flames shot forth from the crater, the brilliancy of which was visible even through the vapors.Thousands of luminous sheets and barbed tongues of fire were cast in various directions.Some, extending beyond the dome of smoke, dissipated it, leaving behind an incandescent powder.This was accompanied by successive explosions, resembling the discharge of a battery of machine-guns."
"赛勒斯·哈丁、通讯记者和赫伯特在高地上呆了一个小时后，走下海滩回到花岗石宫去了。工程师出神地思考着，吉迪恩·史佩莱在担心火山的爆发，是不是会直接或间接地为他们立刻带来危险。","Cyrus Harding, the reporter, and Herbert, after spending an hour on the plateau of Prospect Heights, again descended to the beach, and returned to Granite House.The engineer was thoughtful and preoccupied, so much so, indeed, that Gideon Spilett inquired if he apprehended any immediate danger, of which the eruption might directly or indirectly be the cause."
"“可能是，也可能不是。”赛勒斯·哈丁回答说。","“Yes, and no,” answered Cyrus Harding."
"“不过，”通讯记者接着说，“可能发生在我们身上最不幸的事，不就是能把这座岛掀翻的地震吗？现在，我认为这倒不足为惧，因为水汽和岩浆能自由地喷出去。”","“Nevertheless,” continued the reporter, “would not the greatest misfortune which could happen to us be an earthquake which would overturn the island?Now, I do not suppose that this is to be feared, since the vapors and lava have found a free outlet.”"
"“不错，”赛勒斯·哈丁回答道，“我并不害怕因为地下气体膨胀而引起的一般的地震。但是其他的原因引起的地震可能会引起极大的灾难。”","“True,” replied Cyrus Harding, “and I do not fear an earthquake in the sense in which the term is commonly applied to convulsions of the soil provoked by the expansion of subterranean gases.But other causes may produce great disasters.”"
"“怎么会这样呢，亲爱的赛勒斯？”","“How so, my dear Cyrus?’"
"“我也不能肯定。我得好好考虑一下。我必须去山里看看。过几天我就了解多一些了。”","“I am not certain.I must consider.I must visit the mountain.In a few days I shall learn more on this point.”"
"吉迪恩·史佩莱不再说话了。尽管火山在爆发，而且愈演愈烈，爆炸的回声传遍整个岛，但是花岗石宫的移民们还是美美地睡着了。","Gideon Spilett said no more, and soon, in spite of the explosions of the volcano, whose intensity increased, and which were repeated by the echoes of the island, the inhabitants of Granite House were sleeping soundly."
"1月4日、5日、6日三天过去了。移民们辛勤地继续造船。工程师没有做进一步的解释，只是竭尽全力地投入到工作中。这时候富兰克林山被一片阴云笼罩，火焰中喷出一些白热的岩石，有的喷出来以后又掉到火山口里面去了。这使得潘克洛夫只是把这件事当玩笑一样看待，他看见以后喊道：","Three days passed by—the 4th, 5th, and 6th of January.The construction of the vessel was diligently continued, and without offering further explanations the engineer pushed forward the work with all his energy.Mount Franklin was now hooded by a somber cloud of sinister aspect, and, amid the flames, vomiting forth incandescent rocks, some of which fell back into the crater itself.This caused Pencroft, who would only look at the matter in the light of a joke, to exclaim,—"
"“啊！这个大家伙在玩魔术，它是个魔术师。”","“Ah! the giant is playing at cup and ball; he is a conjurer.”"
"事实上，喷出来的东西又掉进深渊去了。虽然岩浆在内部的压力下已经上涨起来，但似乎还没有上升到火山口那么高。但是无论如何，可以看到东北方向有一部分的缺口，但岩浆还没有从那里向北部山坡流去。","In fact, the substances thrown up fell back again in to the abyss, and it did not seem that the lava, though swollen by the internal pressure, had yet risen to the orifice of the crater.At any rate, the opening on the northeast, which was partly visible, poured out no torrent upon the northern slope of the mountain."
"然而，尽管造船的工作十分紧迫，但是移民们必须要到岛上各处完成其他工作。首先必须要去畜栏，因为摩佛仑羊和山羊都在那里，必须给这些动物喂些饲料。大家安排艾尔顿第二天，也就是1月7日去畜栏。因为他一个人去忙就足够了，并且他对那儿的工作很熟悉。但是潘克洛夫和其他的移民吃惊地听到工程师对艾尔顿说：","Nevertheless, however pressing was the construction of the vessel, other duties demanded the presence of the colonists on various portions of the island.Before everything it was necessary to go to the corral, where the flocks of musmons and goats were enclosed, and replenish the provision of forage for those animals.It was accordingly arranged that Ayrton should proceed thither the next day, the 7th of January; and as he was sufficient for the task, to which he was accustomed, Pencroft and the rest were somewhat surprised on hearing the engineer say to Ayrton—"
"“既然明天你要去畜栏，那么我陪你一起去吧。”","“As you are going to-morrow to the corral I will accompany you.”"
"“但是，哈丁队长，”水手喊道，“我们没有多长时间了，如果你也去的话，我们就缺两双手了！”","“But, Captain Harding,” exclaimed the sailor, “our working days will not be many, and if you go also we shall be two pair of hands short!”"
"“我们明天就回来，”赛勒斯·哈丁回答说，“但是我必须去畜栏。我必须了解一下火山爆发到什么地步了。”","“We shall return to-morrow,” replied Cyrus Harding, “but it is necessary that I should go to the corral.I must learn how the eruption is progressing.”"
"“火山爆发！又是火山爆发！”潘克洛夫不满地答道，“的确，火山爆发是一件重要的事！”但我并不在乎。”","“The eruption! always the eruption!” answered Pencroft, with an air of discontent.“An important thing, truly, this eruption!I trouble myself very little about it.”"
"不管水手的意见如何，工程师决定第二天去畜栏的事情还是定下来了。赫伯特想和赛勒斯·哈丁一起去，但是他不想因为自己的离开而使潘克洛夫恼怒。","Whatever might be the sailor’s opinion, the expedition projected by the engineer was settled for the next day.Herbert wished to accompany Cyrus Harding, but he would not vex Pencroft by his absence."
"第二天天一亮，赛勒斯·哈丁和艾尔顿坐上两匹野驴拉的大车，飞快地向畜栏方向驶去。","The next day, at dawn, Cyrus Harding and Ayrton, mounting the cart drawn by two onagers, took the road to the corral and set off at a round trot."
"大片的烟雾从森林上飘过，富兰克林山的火山口不断往烟雾中增加烟尘。很显然，这些在空气中弥漫的烟雾里有很多杂质。由奇怪的不透明的颜色和重量可以知道，那些烟雾不仅仅从火山里出来。这些岩烬呈粉尘状，像是被磨成粉末状的浮石。它们和像细微的淀粉粒一样的灰色灰尘，形成厚厚的一层，在空中悬浮着。这些灰尘非常轻，它们能在空中飘好几个月。1783年冰岛火山爆发后，火山灰弥漫在大气中有一年之久，就连太阳光线都很难穿透。","Above the forest were passing large clouds, to which the crater of Mount Franklin incessantly added fuliginous matter.These clouds, which rolled heavily in the air, were evidently composed of heterogeneous substances.It was not alone from the volcano that they derived their strange opacity and weight.Scoriae, in a state of dust, like powdered pumice-stone, and grayish ashes as small as the finest feculae, were held in suspension in the midst of their thick folds.These ashes are so fine that they have been observed in the air for whole months.After the eruption of 1783 in Iceland for upwards of a year the atmosphere was thus charged with volcanic dust through which the rays of the sun were only with difficulty discernible."
"在一般情况下，这些粉状物会降落到地面，而现在就是这种状况。赛勒斯·哈丁和艾尔顿快到达畜栏的时候，天空忽然下起一种像细火药面似的黑色的雪，转眼间地上就变了样子。树和草都不见了，上面覆盖着一层几英寸厚的灰。非常幸运的是，风从东北方向吹来，大部分的烟都刮到海上去了。","But more often this pulverized matter falls, and this happened on the present occasion.Cyrus Harding and Ayrton had scarcely reached the corral when a sort of black snow like fine gunpowder fell, and instantly changed the appearance of the soil.Trees, meadows, all disappeared beneath a covering several inches in depth.But, very fortunately, the wind blew from the northeast, and the greater part of the cloud dissolved itself over the sea."
"“这种情况真是少见，哈丁队长。”艾尔顿说。","“This is very singular, Captain Harding,” said Ayrton."
"“情况很严重，”工程师回答，“这种粉末状的浮石和这些矿物质灰尘表明火山下的深处正在发生重大的变化。”","“It is very serious,” replied the engineer.“This powdered pumice-stone, all this mineral dust, proves how grave is the convulsion going forward in the lower depths of the volcano.”"
"“但是什么也不能做吗？”","“But can nothing be done?”"
"“除了看着这种现象发展下去，没有其他办法。因此，艾尔顿，你在畜栏做你必须做的工作。我要爬上红河发源地以外的地方，去看看山北面的情况。然后……”","“Nothing, except to note the progress of the phenomenon.Do you, therefore, Ayrton, occupy yourself with the necessary work at the corral.In the meantime I will ascend just beyond the source of Red Creek and examine the condition of the mountain upon its northern aspect.Then—”"
"“然后如何，哈丁队长？”","“Well, Captain Harding?”"
"“然后我们去‘达卡洞’。我要去检查一下那里的情况。无论如何我会在两个小时内回来找你。”","“Then we will pay a visit to Dakkar Grotto.I wish to inspect it.At any rate I will come back for you in two hours.”"
"艾尔顿去畜栏了。他在等着工程师到来的同时，忙着照料摩弗伦羊和山羊。羊群似乎察觉到了火山即将爆发的迹象，显得有些不安。","Ayrton then proceeded to enter the corral, and, while awaiting the engineer’s return, busied himself with the musmons and goats which seemed to feel a certain uneasiness in presence of these first signs of an eruption."
"与此同时，赛勒斯·哈丁爬上东部支脉的山顶，又经过红河，来到他和他的同伴们第一次探索时发现的硫磺泉的地方。","Meanwhile Cyrus Harding ascended the crest of the eastern spur, passed Red Creek, and arrived at the spot where he and his companions had discovered a sulphurous spring at the time of their first exploration."
"所有东西都变得太多了！现在已经不是一股烟而是十三股烟，好像地底下有活塞在使劲儿推着似的。很明显，地球上这部分地壳受到了可怕的压力。大气里充斥着各种气体，还夹杂着混合了水蒸汽的碳酸气。赛勒斯·哈丁感觉他脚下的火山凝灰岩在颤动，这些在平地上铺成的凝灰岩是由岩烬粉末长期凝结形成的硬石块。但是他并没有发现任何新的岩浆的痕迹。","How changed was everything!Instead of a single column of smoke he counted thirteen, forced through the soil as if violently propelled by some piston.It was evident that the crust of the earth was subjected in this part of the globe to a frightful pressure.The atmosphere was saturated with gases and carbonic acid, mingled with aqueous vapors.Cyrus Harding felt the volcanic tufa with which the plain was strewn, and which was but pulverized cinders hardened into solid blocks by time, tremble beneath him, but he could discover no traces of fresh lava."
"当他把富兰克林山的北山坡全部查看过一遍后，更加肯定这一点了。烟柱和火焰从火山口里冒出,岩烬像冰雹一样落在地上。但是岩浆一点也没有流出火山口，这就证明了火山物质还没有上涨到中央管口的最上方。","The engineer became more assured of this when he observed all the northern part of Mount Franklin.Pillars of smoke and flame escaped from the crater; a hail of scoriae fell on the ground; but no current of lava burst from the mouth of the volcano, which proved that the volcanic matter had not yet attained the level of the superior orifice of the central shaft."
"“可是我宁愿岩浆已经上涨到最上方了，”赛勒斯·哈丁自言自语说道，“至少，我就可以知道岩浆是按照原来的路线流动的。谁敢说它不会开辟一条新路呢？但是危险并不在那儿！尼摩船长已经很清楚地预见到了！不，危险不在那儿！”","“But I would prefer that it were so,” said Cyrus Harding to himself.“At any rate, I should then know that the lava had followed its accustomed track. who can say that it may not take a new course?But the danger does not consist in that!Captain Nemo foresaw it clearly!No, the danger does not lie there!”"
"赛勒斯·哈丁大步走向宽阔的堤道，堤道围着狭窄的鲨鱼湾。现在他可以在这边细细致致地检查岩浆流动的古老通道。他确定，最近的一次火山喷发发生在很久很久以前。","Cyrus Harding advanced towards the enormous causeway whose prolongation enclosed the narrow Shark Gulf.He could now sufficiently examine on this side the ancient channels of the lava.There was no doubt in his mind that the most recent eruption had occurred at a far-distant epoch."
"然后，他又由原路返回，一路上仔细地听着地下的隆隆声，像一直持续的闷雷声一般，偶尔被几声震耳欲聋的爆炸声打断。早上九点钟的时候，他到达了畜栏。","He then returned by the same way, listening attentively to the subterranean mutterings which rolled like long-continued thunder, interrupted by deafening explosions.At nine in the morning he reached the corral."
"艾尔顿正在等他。","Ayrton awaited him."
"“牲口已经照顾好了，哈丁队长。”艾尔顿说。","“The animals are cared for, Captain Harding,” said Ayrton."
"“好，艾尔顿。”","“Good, Ayrton.”"
"“它们好像很不安，哈丁队长。”","“They seem uneasy, Captain Harding.”"
"“是的，直觉告诉它们，直觉从不欺骗人。”","“Yes, instinct speaks through them, and instinct is never deceived.”"
"“你准备好了吗？”","“Are you ready?”"
"“带一盏灯，艾尔顿，”工程师回答说，“我们立即出发。”","“Take a lamp, Ayrton,” answered the engineer; “we will start at once.”"
"艾尔顿按照吩咐做了。卸下缰绳的野驴，在畜栏里游荡。从外面关上门后，赛勒斯·哈丁带着艾尔顿走上了通往西海岸的狭窄的小路。","Ayrton did as desired.The onagers, unharnessed, roamed in the corral.The gate was secured on the outside, and Cyrus Harding, preceding Ayrton, took the narrow path which led westward to the shore."
"他们走过的土地上到处是烟雾中落下的粉尘。森林里没有野兽出没。甚至连鸟也飞走了。有时候微风扬起地上的烟灰，这两个人被扬起的满是尘土的旋风包围，彼此谁也看不见谁。他们小心翼翼地用手帕遮住眼睛和嘴，以免烟灰进入眼睛和嘴中。","The soil they walked upon was choked with the pulverized matter fallen from the cloud.No quadruped appeared in the woods.Even the birds had fled.Sometimes a passing breeze raised the covering of ashes, and the two colonists, enveloped in a whirlwind of dust, lost sight of each other.They were then careful to cover their eyes and mouths with handkerchiefs, for they ran the risk of being blinded and suffocated."
"有了这些障碍，赛勒斯·哈丁和艾尔通是不可能走太快的。并且，空气不流通，好像已经燃烧了一部分氧气，使得呼吸很困难了。每走一百步，他们就得停下来喘喘气。因此，十点多钟的时候，工程师和他的伙伴才到达由巨大的玄武岩和斑岩形成的荒岛西北岸山石顶峰。","It was impossible for Cyrus Harding and Ayrton, with these impediments, to make rapid progress.Moreover, the atmosphere was close, as if the oxygen had been partly burned up, and had become unfit for respiration.At every hundred paces they were obliged to stop to take breath.It was therefore past ten o’clock when the engineer and his companion reached the crest of the enormous mass of rocks of basalt and porphyry which composed the northwest coast of the island."
"艾尔顿和赛勒斯·哈丁开始向陡坡下面走去，几乎是一步一步按照那个暴雨之夜去“达卡洞”的路走的。大白天里，下坡路不像上次那么危险。而且，光亮的岩石上覆盖着一层烟灰，这使得他们的脚步要稳得多。","Ayrton and Cyrus Harding commenced the descent of this abrupt declivity, following almost step for step the difficult path which, during that stormy night, had led them to Dakkar Grotto.In open day the descent was less perilous, and, besides, the bed of ashes which covered the polished surface of the rock enabled them to make their footing more secure."
"他们很快就到达了海岸尽头约40英尺高的分水岭。赛勒斯·哈丁想起来这座高高的分水岭是逐渐倾斜到海里去的。虽然目前潮水很低，但还是看不见海滩。掺杂着火山灰的波浪很浑浊，不断拍打着玄武岩石。","The ridge at the end of the shore, about forty feet in height, was soon reached.Cyrus Harding recollected that this elevation gradually sloped towards the level of the sea.Although the tide was at present low, no beach could he seen, and the waves, thickened by the volcanic dust, beat upon the basaltic rocks."
"赛勒斯·哈丁和艾尔顿毫不费力就找到了“达卡洞”的入口。他们在进入洞口前的最后一块岩石边停留了一会儿。","Cyrus Harding and Ayrton found without difficulty the entrance to Dakkar Grotto, and paused for a moment at the last rock before it."
"“铁皮船应该在那儿。”工程师说。","“The iron boat should be there,” said the engineer."
"“在这儿呢，哈丁队长。”艾尔顿说着把存放在拱门底下的小船拉过来。","“It is here, Captain Harding,” replied Ayrton, drawing towards him the fragile craft, which was protected by the arch of the vault."
"“上船，艾尔顿！”","“On board, Ayrton!”"
"两个人上了船。微微的水波把小船带到洞窟里的低拱门之下。在那儿，艾尔顿用火刀和火石点着了灯。然后他拿起桨来，把灯放在船头，这样灯光就能往前照射了。塞勒斯·哈丁掌起舵，在阴暗的洞窟里驾驶。","The two colonists stepped into the boat.A slight undulation of the waves carried it farther under the low arch of the crypt, and there Ayrton, with the aid of flint and steel, lighted the lamp.He then took the oars, and the lamp having been placed in the bow of the boat, so that its rays fell before them, Cyrus Harding took the helm and steered through the shades of the grotto."
"“诺第留斯号”不再用它的电光照射洞窟了。船上的灯光也许还没有熄灭，但没有一线光从尼摩船长长眠的深渊里照射上来。","The “Nautilus” was there no longer to illuminate the cavern with its electric light.Possibly it might not yet be extinguished, but no ray escaped from the depths of the abyss in which reposed all that was mortal of Captain Nemo."
"这盏灯发出的光尽管很微弱，但是还能够指引工程师沿着洞窟的墙壁慢慢前进。在圆拱形的顶下，至少是在靠外面的这一部分是死一般的静寂。不一会儿，赛勒斯·哈丁就清楚地听到山内部传来的隆隆声了。","The light afforded by the lamp, although feeble, nevertheless enabled the engineer to advance slowly, following the wall of the cavern.A deathlike silence reigned under the vaulted roof, or at least in the anterior portion, for soon Cyrus Harding distinctly heard the rumbling which proceeded from the bowels of the mountain."
"“那是从火山里传出来的。”他说。","“That comes from the volcano,” he said."
"除了这些声音外，他们很快闻到一种强烈的气味，从这种强烈的气味得知这里在发生着化学变化。工程师和他的伙伴在这种带着硫磺味的水蒸汽中几乎要窒息。","Besides these sounds, the presence of chemical combinations was soon betrayed by their powerful odor, and the engineer and his companion were almost suffocated by sulphurous vapors."
"“尼摩船长担心的就是这个，”赛勒斯·哈丁低语着，脸色也开始变了，“尽管这样，我们还是必须到洞的最里面去。”","“This is what Captain Nemo feared,” murmured Cyrus Harding, changing countenance.“We must go to the end, notwithstanding.”"
"“向前！”艾尔顿说着，弯下腰拾起双桨，划船走向洞窟的尽头。","“Forward!” replied Ayrton, bending to his oars and directing the boat towards the head of the cavern."
"进洞口25分钟后，小船到达了洞窟的尽头。","Twenty-five minutes after entering the mouth of the grotto the boat reached the extreme end."
"这时赛勒斯·哈丁站起身来，把灯光照射在洞窟的墙上。这堵墙隔开了洞窟和火山的中央管道。这堵墙有多厚呢？也许有十英尺，也许有一百英尺—都不好说。但是地底下的响声太清楚了，据此可以猜想这堵墙不会太厚。","Cyrus Harding then, standing up, cast the light of the lamp upon the walls of the cavern which separated it from the central shaft of the volcano.What was the thickness of this wall?It might be ten feet or a hundred feet—it was impossible to say.But the subterranean sounds were too perceptible to allow of the supposition that it was of any great thickness."
"工程师检查了墙的下部后，把灯绑在桨上，又开始查看墙高处的玄武石。","The engineer, after having explored the wall at a certain height horizontally, fastened the lamp to the end of an oar, and again surveyed the basaltic wall at a greater elevation."
"就在那儿，墙上有很多难以看清的缝隙，缝隙里冒出刺鼻的水蒸汽，扩散在洞窟的空气里。墙上还有几处大裂缝，有的一直裂到离水面两三英尺的地方。","There, through scarcely visible clefts and joinings, escaped a pungent vapor, which infected the atmosphere of the cavern.The wall was broken by large cracks, some of which extended to within two or three feet of the water’s edge."
"赛勒斯·哈丁沉思了片刻。然后他低声说道：","Cyrus Harding thought for a brief space.Then he said in a low voice,—"
"“是的！船长是对的！危险就在这儿，而且很可怕！”","“Yes! the captain was right!The danger lies there, and a terrible danger!”"
"艾尔顿一句话也没有说。但是通过赛勒斯·哈丁的一个手势，他又划起桨来。半个小时后，他和工程师又回到“达卡洞”的入口处。","Ayrton said not a word, but, upon a sign from Cyrus Harding, resumed the oars, and half an hour later the engineer and he reached the entrance of Dakkar Grotto."
"第十九章","Chapter 19"
"赛勒斯·哈丁和艾尔顿在畜栏呆了一天一夜，安顿好了一切，第二天，也就是1月8日，他们又回到了花岗石宫。","The next day, the 8th day of January, after a day and night passed at the corral, where they left all in order, Cyrus Harding and Ayrton arrived at Granite House."
"工程师立即召集所有的同伴，通知他们林肯岛马上面临着威胁，任何人都没有力量使他们脱离危险。","The engineer immediately called his companions together, and informed them of the imminent danger which threatened Lincoln Island, and from which no human power could deliver them."
"“朋友们，”他说着，声音里流露出激动之情，“我们的岛并不是那种可以和地球共存亡的岛。它很快就要毁灭了，毁灭的原因就隐藏在岛的里面，而且无法挽救。”","“My friends,” he said, and his voice betrayed the depth of his emotion, “our island is not among those which will endure while this earth endures.It is doomed to more or less speedy destruction, the cause of which it bears within itself, and from which nothing can save it.”"
"移民们面面相觑，最后都看着工程师。他们还不太明白他的意思。","The colonists looked at each other, then at the engineer.They did not clearly comprehend him."
"“你解释一下吧，赛勒斯！”吉迪恩·史佩莱说。","“Explain yourself, Cyrus!” said Gideon Spilett."
"“我是要解释，”赛勒斯·哈丁回答道，“或者可以说，我要把尼摩船长在弥留之际和我单独谈了几分钟时所解释的话告诉你们。”","“I will do so,” replied Cyrus Harding, “or rather I will simply afford you the explanation which, during our few minutes of private conversation, was given me by Captain Nemo.”"
"“尼摩船长！”移民们喊道。","“Captain Nemo!” exclaimed the colonists."
"“是的，这是他临死前提供给我们的最后一次服务！”","“Yes, and it was the last service he desired to render us before his death!”"
"“最后一次服务！”潘克洛夫叫道，“最后一次服务！你们将来会看到，虽然他已经去世了，他还会为我们提供其他服务的！”","“The last service!” exclaimed Pencroft, “the last service!You will see that though he is dead he will render us others yet!”"
"“但是船长说了些什么呢？”通讯记者问道。","“But what did the captain say?” inquired the reporter."
"“我正要告诉你们，我的朋友们，”工程师说，“林肯岛和太平洋里其他的岛屿不同，尼摩船长告诉我，事实上林肯岛的根基迟早是要被颠覆的。”","“I will tell you, my friends,” said the engineer.“Lincoln Island does not resemble the other islands of the Pacific, and a fact of which Captain Nemo has made me cognizant must sooner or later bring about the subversion of its foundation.”"
"“胡说！林肯岛不会的！”潘克洛夫喊道。虽然他很尊敬赛勒斯·哈丁，但他忍不住做了一个不相信的手势。","“Nonsense!Lincoln Island, it can’t be!” cried Pencroft, who, in spite of the respect he felt for Cyrus Harding, could not prevent a gesture of incredulity."
"“听着，潘克洛夫，”工程师接着说，“我要把尼摩船长告诉我的话告诉你们。在昨天检查了‘达卡洞’之后，我已经证实了他说的一切。","“Listen, Pencroft,” resumed the engineer, “I will tell you what Captain Nemo communicated to me, and which I myself confirmed yesterday, during the exploration of Dakkar Grotto."
"“这个洞窟在岛下一直延伸到火山底下，火山的中央管道和洞窟之间仅有一墙之隔。现在这面墙上有许多裂缝，现在缝隙里已经冒出来火山内部发出来的硫磺气体了。”","“This cavern stretches under the island as far as the volcano, and is only separated from its central shaft by the wall which terminates it.Now, this wall is seamed with fissures and clefts which already allow the sulphurous gases generated in the interior of the volcano to escape.”"
"“什么？”潘克洛夫突然皱起眉头说。","“Well?” said Pencroft, his brow suddenly contracting."
"“嗯，后来，我发现这些裂缝由于内部的压力变宽了，玄武岩的墙壁逐渐裂开，迟早会裂出一条大口子，连通火山管道和充满海水的洞窟。”","“Well, then, I saw that these fissures widen under the internal pressure from within, that the wall of basalt is gradually giving way and that after a longer or shorter period it will afford a passage to the waters of the lake which fill the cavern.”"
"“好啊！”潘克洛夫高兴地答道，“海水将会扑灭火山，就什么事也没有啦！”","“Good!” replied Pencroft, with an attempt at pleasantry.“The sea will extinguish the volcano, and there will be an end of the matter!”"
"“不是那样的！”赛勒斯·哈丁说，“等到海水灌进洞窟，通过中央管道进入岛内部沸腾的岩浆里去的那一天，林肯岛就要被炸到天上去了——如果地中海的海水灌进埃得纳火山中去，西西里岛也会这样的。”","“Not so!” said Cyrus Harding, “should a day arrive when the sea, rushing through the wall of the cavern, penetrates by the central shaft into the interior of the island to the boiling lava, Lincoln Island will that day be blown into the air—just as would happen to the island of Sicily were the Mediterranean to precipitate itself into Mount Etna.”"
"听了工程师说的这番意义重大的话，移民们都不作声了。现在他们明白面临的危险了。","The colonists made no answer to these significant words of the engineer.They now understood the danger by which they were menaced."
"应该补充一点，赛勒斯·哈丁丝毫没有夸大值得他们担忧的危险。火山几乎都在海或湖的岸边，所以很多人想当然以为只要开出一条通道把水灌进火山，就可以把火山熄灭。但是他们却不知道这样会引发地球局部爆炸的危险，就如锅炉里的气体遇到高温会突然膨胀一样。火山里的温度可能达到几千度，灌进去的水会立刻转化成气体，突然产生一种不可阻挡的能量。","It may be added that Cyrus Harding had in no way exaggerated the danger to be apprehended.Many persons have formed an idea that it would be possible to extinguish volcanoes, which are almost always situated on the shores of a sea or lake, by opening a passage for the admission of the water.But they are not aware that this would be to incur the risk of blowing up a portion of the globe, like a boiler whose steam is suddenly expanded by intense heat.The water, rushing into a cavity whose temperature might be estimated at thousands of degrees, would be converted into steam with a sudden energy which no enclosure could resist."
"因此，毫无疑问，可怕的震动在一步步向林肯岛逼近，“达卡洞”的石墙能保持多久，林肯岛就能存在多久。这不是几个月，也不是几个星期的问题，而是几天，甚至可能是几个小时的问题。","It was not therefore doubtful that the island, menaced by a frightful and approaching convulsion, would endure only so long as the wall of Dakkar Grotto itself should endure.It was not even a question of months, nor of weeks, but of days; it might be of hours."
"移民们的第一反应是心情极其悲痛。他们并没有过多考虑自己面临的危险，他们痛心的是长期庇护他们的岛屿就要毁灭了。他们开拓了这个荒岛，他们爱这个岛，想使它变得繁荣。但是他们这么多的努力都白费了，这么多劳动也白费了。","The first sentiment which the colonists felt was that of profound sorrow.They thought not so much of the peril which menaced themselves personally, but of the destruction of the island which had sheltered them, which they had cultivated, which they loved so well, and had hoped to render so flourishing.So much effort ineffectually expended, so much labor lost."
"一大颗眼泪从潘克洛夫的脸上滑落，他也没有刻意掩饰。","Pencroft could not prevent a large tear from rolling down his cheek, nor did he attempt to conceal it."
"现在讨论进一步展开。移民们讨论了对他们有利的机会。最终大家一致同意一个小时也不要浪费，造船工作要全力以赴，加快进行，这是林肯岛移民获得安全的唯一出路。","Some further conversation now took place.The chances yet in favor of the colonists were discussed; but finally it was agreed that there was not an hour to be lost, that the building and fitting of the vessel should be pushed forward with their utmost energy, and that this was the sole chance of safety for the inhabitants of Lincoln Island."
"因此，每个人都开始参加到造船工作中去。现在播种、收割、打猎和增加花岗石宫的储备还有什么用呢？不管他们的航程要持续多久，仓库和外面储存的物资都足以支撑他们的旅程。但是紧急的是，他们必须先把船造好，以保证不可避免的灾难到来之前船可以供他们使用。","All hands, therefore, set to work on the vessel.What could it avail to sow, to reap, to hunt, to increase the stores of Granite House?The contents of the storehouse and outbuildings contained more than sufficient to provide the ship for a voyage, however long might be its duration.But it was imperative that the ship should be ready to receive them before the inevitable catastrophe should arrive."
"他们以火一般的热情进行着工作。到1月23日的时候，船上的甲板已经铺好了一半。到目前为止，火山顶峰上并没有发生变化。火山口喷出来水蒸气和烟雾，还夹杂着火焰和白热的岩石。可是在23日的夜里，岩浆流到了火山第一层的表面，覆盖在另一个火山锥上的帽状火山锥不见了。可怕的响声传来。起初移民们以为岛被炸开了，都从花岗石宫里冲了出来。","Their labors were now carried on with feverish ardor.By the 23rd of January the vessel was half-decked over.Up to this time no change had taken place on the summit of the volcano.Vapor and smoke mingled with flames and incandescent stones were thrown up from the crater.But during the night of the 23rd, in consequence of the lava attaining the level of the first stratum of the volcano, the hat-shaped cone which formed over the latter disappeared.A frightful sound was heard.The colonists at first thought the island was rent asunder, and rushed out of Granite House."
"这时候大概是凌晨两点钟。","This occurred about two o’clock in the morning."
"天空好像着了火一样。原来是山顶的火山锥被抛到岛上，震动了岛的地基。这个火山锥是由大堆的大堆的岩石组成，高达一千英尺，重达亿万磅。幸运的是，由于这个火山锥向北倾斜，最终落在火山和大海之间的沙子和凝灰岩的平地上了。火山口因此扩大，喷向天空的火焰更加闪耀，反射出来的光线把天空照得通红。同时，一股岩浆流从新的山顶倾泻而下，像一条长长的飞瀑，又像花瓶里水满而溢一样。上千条火舌沿着火山坡滑下。","The sky appeared on fire.The superior cone, a mass of rock a thousand feet in height, and weighing thousands of millions of pounds, had been thrown down upon the island, making it tremble to its foundation.Fortunately, this cone inclined to the north, and had fallen upon the plain of sand and tufa stretching between the volcano and the sea.The aperture of the crater being thus enlarged projected towards the sky a glare so intense that by the simple effect of reflection the atmosphere appeared red-hot.At the same time a torrent of lava, bursting from the new summit, poured out in long cascades, like water escaping from a vase too full, and a thousand tongues of fire crept over the sides of the volcano."
"“畜栏！畜栏！”艾尔顿喊道。","“The corral! the corral!” exclaimed Ayrton."
"的确，岩浆正朝着畜栏方向流。由于新的火山口面向东方，因此岛上土地肥沃的地区、红河的源头和啄木鸟林很快就要毁灭了。","It was, in fact, towards the corral that the lava was rushing as the new crater faced the east, and consequently the fertile portions of the island, the springs of Red Creek and Jacamar Wood, were menaced with instant destruction."
"听到艾尔顿的叫声后，移民们匆忙向野驴棚跑去。马车马上就套好了。所有人想法都一致，那就是赶快到畜栏把那里的牲口放出来。","At Ayrton’s cry the colonists rushed to the onagers’ stables.The cart was at once harnessed.All were possessed by the same thought—to hasten to the corral and set at liberty the animals it enclosed."
"将近凌晨三点钟的时候，他们到达了畜栏。摩弗仑羊和山羊叫了起来，这说明它们十分恐惧。一股燃烧的物质和熔化的矿石从山的一侧流到草场上，一直流到栅栏边上。艾尔顿很快打开畜栏的大门，恐惧的牲口向四面八方逃跑。","Before three in the morning they arrived at the corral.The cries of the terrified musmons and goats indicated the alarm which possessed them.Already a torrent of burning matter and liquefied minerals fell from the side of the mountain upon the meadows as far as the side of the palisade.The gate was burst open by Ayrton, and the animals, bewildered with terror, fled in all directions."
"一个小时后，沸腾的岩浆流满了畜栏，从畜栏流过的小河的河水化成了一片蒸汽，房子像干草一样烧成灰烬，甚至连栅栏的木桩也一根没剩，完全辨认不出这里曾经有畜栏。","An hour afterwards the boiling lava filled the corral, converting into vapor the water of the little rivulet which ran through it, burning up the house like dry grass, and leaving not even a post of the palisade to mark the spot where the corral once stood."
"和这种灾难斗争可以说是荒唐，甚至可以说是发疯。面对大自然的强烈震动，人类无能为力。","To contend against this disaster would have been folly—nay, madness.In presence of Nature’s grand convulsions man is powerless."
"现在天已经亮了，已经是1月24日。赛勒斯·哈丁和他的伙伴们想在回花岗石宫之前，确定岩浆的大致流向。地势从富兰克林山起向东海岸渐渐倾斜。让人担心的是，虽然有浓密的啄木鸟林阻隔，岩浆流很可能还是要流到眺望岗的高地上。","It was now daylight—the 24th of January.Cyrus Harding and his companions, before returning to Granite House, desired to ascertain the probable direction this inundation of lava was about to take.The soil sloped gradually from Mount Franklin to the east coast, and it was to be feared that, in spite of the thick Jacamar Wood, the torrent would reach the plateau of Prospect Heights."
"“湖会保护我们的。”吉迪恩·史佩莱说。","“The lake will cover us,” said Gideon Spilett."
"“但愿如此！”赛勒斯·哈丁只回答了这么一句。","“I hope so!” was Cyrus Harding’s only reply."
"移民们想到富兰克林山较高的火山锥坠落的那片平原上去，但是岩浆挡住了他们的去路。一股岩浆顺着红河河谷流下来，一股顺着瀑布河河谷流下来。岩浆所到之处，河水都蒸发了。要横跨岩浆流是不可能的，相反，移民们面对岩浆流只能往后退。火山没有了顶以后，已经辨认不出原来的样子，代替古代火山口的是一片像平整的桌面一样的东西。南边和东边各有一个喷口，岩浆不断地从里面喷泻出来，形成两股清晰的洪流。新的火山口上冒起的烟雾混在空气里，笼罩着整个岛屿。轰隆隆的雷声与火山发出的轰隆声交织在一起，几乎无法分辨。火山口喷出燃烧的石块，直射到一千多英尺的高空，然后像炮弹一样在空气中爆炸。一道道闪电竞相与火山喷发比试。","The colonists were desirous of reaching the plain upon which the superior cone of Mount Franklin had fallen, but the lava arrested their progress.It had followed, on one side, the valley of Red Creek, and on the other that of Falls River, evaporating those watercourses in its passage.There was no possibility of crossing the torrent of lava; on the contrary, the colonists were obliged to retreat before it.The volcano, without its crown, was no longer recognizable, terminated as it was by a sort of flat table which replaced the ancient crater.From two openings in its southern and eastern sides an unceasing flow of lava poured forth, thus forming two distinct streams.Above the new crater a cloud of smoke and ashes, mingled with those of the atmosphere, massed over the island.Loud peals of thunder broke, and could scarcely be distinguished from the rumblings of the mountain, whose mouth vomited forth ignited rocks, which, hurled to more than a thousand feet, burst in the air like shells.Flashes of lightning rivaled in intensity the volcano’s eruption."
"将近早上七点钟的时候，移民们的阵地再也坚守不住了，于是他们只得藏身到啄木鸟林的边缘地带。抛射下来的东西下雨似的落在他们周围，甚至从红河河床流下来的岩浆也要切断去畜栏的路了。最近的一排树着火了，树汁突然转化成蒸汽开始爆炸，发出响亮的声音。其他不太潮湿的树木，在岩浆流里安然矗立。","Towards seven in the morning the position was no longer tenable by the colonists, who accordingly took shelter in the borders of Jacamar Wood.Not only did the projectiles begin to rain around them, but the lava, overflowing the bed of Red Creek, threatened to cut off the road to the corral.The nearest rows of trees caught fire, and their sap, suddenly transformed into vapor, caused them to explode with loud reports, while others, less moist, remained unhurt in the midst of the inundation."
"移民们又走上了去畜栏的路。他们走得很慢，时不时回头看看。由于地面倾斜，岩浆很快地往东流，所以下层的岩浆刚刚凝固，就被上面的沸腾岩浆淹没了。","The colonists had again taken the road to the corral.They proceeded but slowly, frequently looking back; but, in consequence of the inclination of the soil, the lava gained rapidly in the east, and as its lower waves became solidified others, at boiling heat, covered them immediately."
"这个时候，红河河谷的主要洪流越来越危险。这一片的森林着了火，滚滚浓烟在树上翻滚，树干已经被岩浆淹没。","Meanwhile, the principal stream of Red Creek Valley became more and more menacing.All this portion of the forest was on fare, and enormous wreaths of smoke rolled over the trees, whore trunks were already consumed by the lava."
"移民们在距离红河河口半英里的湖边停下。现在是决定生死存亡的时候了。","The colonists halted near the lake, about half a mile from the mouth of Red Creek.A question of life or death was now to be decided."
"赛勒斯·哈丁是习惯思考重要问题的，并且他也清楚，不管怎么样，大家听了真相后也能经受得住。于是他说道：","Cyrus Harding, accustomed to the consideration of important crises, and aware that he was addressing men capable of hearing the truth, whatever it might be, then said,—"
"“要么湖水挡住岩浆前进，这样的话一部分岛屿就可以保留下来，不至于完全毁灭；要么岩浆流过远西森林，地上不留一草一木。如果这样的话，我们除了在这些光秃秃的石头上等着饿死别无它法。如果岛爆炸，我们的死期还可能提前。”","“Either the lake will arrest the progress of the lava, and a part of the island will be preserved from utter destruction, or the stream will overrun the forests of the Far West, and not a tree or plant will remain on the surface of the soil.We shall have no prospect but that of starvation upon these barren rocks—a death which will probably be anticipated by the explosion of the island.”"
"“既然这样，”潘克洛夫抱着胳膊跺着脚说，“我们造船还有什么用呢？”","“In that case,” replied Pencroft, folding his arms and stamping his foot, “what’s the use of working any longer on the vessel?”"
"“潘克洛夫，”赛勒斯·哈丁说，“我们一定要坚持到最后！”","“Pencroft,” answered Cyrus Harding, “we must do our duty to the last!”"
"这时候，岩浆流在吞没了一些珍贵的树后冲出了一条通道，一直到达湖的边缘。这一带地势较高，如果再高一些，也许就可以阻断岩浆流。","At this instant the river of lava, after having broken a passage through the noble trees it devoured in its course, reached the borders of the lake.At this point there was an elevation of the soil which, had it been greater, might have sufficed to arrest the torrent."
"“开始干吧！”赛勒斯·哈丁喊道。","“To work!” cried Cyrus Harding."
"大家立刻领会了工程师的意思。他们可以截断洪流，让它流入湖里。","The engineer’s thought was at once understood. it might be possible to dam, as it were, the torrent, and thus compel it to pour itself into the lake."
"移民们赶忙跑到造船所。他们拿回很多铲子、锄头和斧头，用泥土和倒下的树木在几个小时内成功筑起一道三英尺高、数百步长的堤坝。完工的时候，对他们来说，似乎感觉只干了几分钟。","The colonists hastened to the dockyard.They returned with shovels, picks, axes, and by means of banking the earth with the aid of fallen trees they succeeded in a few hours in raising an embankment three feet high and some hundreds of paces in length.It seemed to them, when they had finished, as if they had scarcely been working more than a few minutes."
"堤坝完成得正是时候。岩浆不久就流到堤坝脚下了。岩浆流像河水漫过河岸般地肆意泛滥，威胁着这道能够阻挡它淹没整个远西森林的唯一屏障。但是堤坝很牢固，经过一段时间的僵持后，岩浆流流入了二十英尺下的格兰特湖。","It was not a moment too soon.The liquefied substances soon after reached the bottom of the barrier.The stream of lava swelled like a river about to overflow its banks, and threatened to demolish the sole obstacle which could prevent it from overrunning the whole Far West.But the dam held firm, and after a moment of terrible suspense the torrent precipitated itself into Grant Lake from a height of twenty feet."
"移民们一动不动，也不作声，屏住呼吸看着双方交战。","The colonists, without moving or uttering a word, breathlessly regarded this strife of the two elements."
"水与火的搏击是多么壮观啊！什么笔墨可以描绘出这一惊奇恐怖的场景呢？湖水在岩浆的作用下蒸发，嗞嗞作响。水蒸汽在空气中盘旋而上，升到一个无可测量的高度，好像一个大锅炉的阀门突然被打开了似的。但是，不管湖里的水有多少，最后还是要干枯的。因为已经没有水补充湖水了，同时无穷的岩浆夹带的白色物质却不断流到湖里。","What a spectacle was this conflict between water and fire!What pen could describe the marvelous horror of this scene—what pencil could depict it?The water hissed as it evaporated by contact with the boiling lava.The vapor whirled in the air to an immeasurable height, as if the valves of an immense boiler had been suddenly opened.But, however considerable might be the volume of water contained in the lake, it must eventually be absorbed, because it was not replenished, while the stream of lava, fed from an inexhaustible source, rolled on without ceasing new waves of incandescent matter."
"第一股岩浆流流入湖中后立即凝固，继而很快堆积起来高出水面。新的岩浆又覆盖到堆积物的表面，依次化为岩石，但是一步步逼近湖中心。这种情况下就形成了一个突堤，要把湖逐渐填满。湖水不可能泛滥起来，因为它们遇到岩浆而蒸发，岩浆代替了它们的位置。刺耳的嗞嗞声到处作响，水汽被风吹走，像雨点般地落入大海。突堤越来越长，岩浆块一个个堆积起来。原来平静的湖水现在变成了一大堆冒着烟的岩石，好像是土地上升而形成的一大片浅滩。想象一下，如果湖水被飓风掀起时突然遇到霜冻而凝结，就可以知道三个小时后这股不可阻挡的岩浆流注入湖中是什么景象了。","The first waves of lava which fell in the lake immediately solidified and accumulated so as speedily to emerge from it.Upon their surface fell other waves, which in their turn became stone, but a step nearer the center of the lake.In this manner was formed a pier which threatened to gradually fill up the lake, which could not overflow, the water displaced by the lava being evaporated.The hissing of the water rent the air with a deafening sound, and the vapor, blown by the wind, fell in rain upon the sea.The pier became longer and longer, and the blocks of lava piled themselves one on another.Where formerly stretched the calm waters of the lake now appeared an enormous mass of smoking rocks, as if an upheaving of the soil had formed immense shoals.Imagine the waters of the lake aroused by a hurricane, then suddenly solidified by an intense frost, and some conception may be formed of the aspect of the lake three hours alter the eruption of this irresistible torrent of lava."
"这一次，水要被火征服了。","This time water would be vanquished by fire."
"无论如何，岩浆流向了格兰特湖，这对移民们是有利的。他们可以暂缓几天了。眺望岗的高地、花岗石宫和造船所暂时都保存下来了。现在必须利用这几天的时间为船铺上板子，仔细填补船缝，并让船下水。那时移民们就可以到船上避难了，等船下水以后再安装索具。如果爆炸发生，荒岛将被毁灭，那时在岸上也不安全。花岗石宫曾经是可靠的藏身之所，但是现在它的墙壁随时可能坍塌。","Nevertheless it was a fortunate circumstance for the colonists that the effusion of lava should have been in the direction of Lake Grant.They had before them some days’ respite.The plateau of Prospect Heights, Granite House, and the dockyard were for the moment preserved.And these few days it was necessary to employ in planking and carefully calking the vessel, and launching her.The colonists would then take refuge on board the vessel, content to rig her after she should be afloat on the waters.With the danger of an explosion which threatened to destroy the island there could be no security on shore.The walls of Granite House, once so sure a retreat, might at any moment fall in upon them."
"在以后的六天里，从1月25日到1月30日，移民们在造船工作中，做了相当于二十个人的工作。他们几乎一刻也不让自己休息。火山口喷射出来的火光使他们得以夜以继日地工作。岩浆还在不断地流出，却少了许多。这是极其幸运的，因为格兰特湖几乎已经填满了，要是更多的岩浆流过来，不可避免地要流到眺望岗的高地上，然后再流到海滩上。","During the six following days, from the 25th to the 30th of January, the colonists accomplished as much of the construction of their vessel as twenty men could have done.They hardly allowed themselves a moment’s repose, and the glare of the flames which shot from the crater enabled them to work night and day.The flow of lava continued, but perhaps less abundantly.This was fortunate, for Lake Grant was almost entirely choked up, and if more lava should accumulate it would inevitably spread over the plateau of Prospect Heights, and thence upon the beach."
"但是，虽然岛这边有一部分被保护，但是西边并不是这样。","But if the island was thus partially protected on this side, it was not so with the western part."
"事实上，第二股岩浆流顺着瀑布河的河谷而流，这条河谷非常宽阔，两岸地势平坦，岩浆流经过这里没有遇到任何阻碍。沸腾的岩浆扩散到远西森林。在这个季节，树木都被酷热的气候烤干了。树木立刻着了火，火焰在树干间和高处的树枝间蔓延，高处的树枝交叉在一起，大火蔓延得更加迅速。树梢上火焰的蔓延速度似乎比树根处岩浆的流动速度还要快。","In fact, the second stream of lava, which had followed the valley of Falls River, a valley of great extent, the land on both sides of the creek being flat, met with no obstacle.The burning liquid had then spread through the forest of the Far West.At this period of the year, when the trees were dried up by a tropical heat, the forest caught fire instantaneously, in such a manner that the conflagration extended itself both by the trunks of the trees and by their higher branches, whose interlacement favored its progress.It even appeared that the current of flame spread more rapidly among the summits of the trees than the current of lava at their bases."
"美洲豹、野猪、水豚、考拉和各种野生动物都惊慌失措，纷纷往慈悲河岸边和通向气球港的路上的沼泽奔逃。移民们正忙着工作，甚至连最凶猛的野兽也无暇顾忌。他们离开了花岗石宫，也不在“石窟”里居住了，只在慈悲河河口处搭了一个帐篷露宿。","Thus it happened that the wild animals, jaguars, wild boars, capybaras, koalas, and game of every kind, mad with terror, had fled to the banks of the Mercy and to the Tadorn Marsh, beyond the road to Port Balloon.But the colonists were too much occupied with their task to pay any attention to even the most formidable of these animals.They had abandoned Granite House, and would not even take shelter at the Chimneys, but encamped under a tent, near the mouth of the Mercy."
"赛勒斯·哈丁和吉迪恩·史佩莱每天都登上眺望岗的高地。有时候赫伯特跟着他们，但潘克洛夫从来不去，他不忍心看到现在岛上彻底遭到毁灭的悲惨景象。","Each day Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett ascended the plateau of Prospect Heights.Sometimes Herbert accompanied them, but never Pencroft, who could not bear to look upon the prospect of the island now so utterly devastated."
"这的确是令人痛心的景象。这个岛上的森林地带现在全都光秃了。只有盘蛇半岛的尽头还残留着一丛绿树。到处是奇形怪状的树桩，个个被熏得漆黑，连树枝也没有了。这一带被毁坏的森林甚至比沼泽地还要荒凉。岩浆流流得到处都是。原来迷人的青翠草原现在变成了一大片荒凉的火山凝灰岩。瀑布河和慈悲河的河谷里，再没有一滴水流入大海了。要是格兰特湖完全干涸的话，移民们就没有办法解决饮水问题了。南边一角的湖水没有被岩浆侵占，这里是岛上仅有的淡水源了。西北方屹立着轮廓清晰的崎岖的火山坡，像一只巨爪在荒岛上盘旋。这是多么凄惨而可怕的景象啊！对移民们来说，又是多么痛心啊！过去有肥沃的土地，覆盖着森林，有水源灌溉，在移民们的辛勤劳动下还收获了丰富的物产，现在变成了荒山，他们除了储备的粮食外，连维持生活的必需品都没有了。","It was, in truth, a heart-rending spectacle.All the wooded part of the island was now completely bare.One single clump of green trees raised their heads at the extremity of Serpentine Peninsula.Here and there were a few grotesque blackened and branchless stumps.The side of the devastated forest was even more barren than Tadorn Marsh.The eruption of lava had been complete.Where formerly sprang up that charming verdure, the soil was now nothing but a savage mass of volcanic tufa.In the valleys of the Falls and Mercy rivers no drop of water now flowed towards the sea, and should Lake Grant be entirely dried up, the colonists would have no means of quenching their thirst.But, fortunately the lava had spared the southern corner of the lake, containing all that remained of the drinking water of the island.Towards the northwest stood out the rugged and well-defined outlines of the sides of the volcano, like a gigantic claw hovering over the island.What a sad and fearful sight, and how painful to the colonists, who, from a fertile domain covered with forests, irrigated by watercourses, and enriched by the produce of their toils, found themselves, as it were, transported to a desolate rock, upon which, but for their reserves of provisions, they could not even gather the means of subsistence!"
"“这足以让人心碎了！”有一天吉迪恩·史佩莱说。","“It is enough to break one’s heart!” said Gideon Spilett, one day."
"“是的，史佩莱，”工程师说，“但愿上帝给我们时间来完成这艘船，现在它是我们唯一的避难所了！”","“Yes, Spilett,” answered the engineer.“May God grant us the time to complete this vessel, now our sole refuge!”"
"“赛勒斯，你难道不觉得火山爆发得不是那么猛烈了吗？如果我没有搞错的话，火山依然在喷岩浆，但是喷得比以前少多了。”","“Do not you think, Cyrus, that the violence of the eruption has somewhat lessened?The volcano still vomits forth lava, but somewhat less abundantly, if I mistake not.”"
"“这倒关系不大，”赛勒斯·哈丁回答说，“火还在山内部燃烧呢，海水随时可能灌进去。我们就好像一群乘客，船失了火，但没办法扑灭，我们又知道火迟早要烧到火药库里去。干吧，史佩莱，干吧，我们一个小时也不能浪费！”","“It matters little,” answered Cyrus Harding.“The fire is still burning in the interior of the mountain, and the sea may break in at any moment.We are in the condition of passengers whose ship is devoured by a conflagration which they cannot extinguish, and who know that sooner or later the flames must reach the powder-magazine.To work, Spilett, to work, and let us not lose an hour!”"
"又过了八天，也就是直到2月7日，岩浆还在不断溢出，火山爆发仍然维持在原来的水平上。赛勒斯·哈丁担心岩浆会泛滥到海边，如果那样的话，造船所就在劫难逃了。而且，此时移民们感觉岛屿开始颤动，这使他们倍感恐惧。","During eight days more, that is to say until the 7th of February, the lava continued to flow, but the eruption was confined within the previous limits.Cyrus Harding feared above all lest the liquefied matter should overflow the shore, for in that event the dockyard could not escape.Moreover, about this time the colonists felt in the frame of the island vibrations which alarmed them to the highest degree."
"这一天是2月20日。还要一个月船才能下水。这个岛能坚持到那时吗？潘克洛夫和赛勒斯·哈丁打算船身完工后就让船立刻下水。甲板、干舷、内部的木制品和索具都可以将来再完成。主要是要让移民们在岛外有一个可靠的避难所。也许把船带到气球港去会好一些，也就是说，尽量离爆炸中心远一些，因为慈悲河口在岛和花岗石墙壁之间，一旦发生巨变，他们的船停在那儿是有被砸碎的危险的。因此航海家们的所有努力集中在完成船身的工作上。","It was the 20th of February.Yet another month must elapse before the vessel would be ready for sea.Would the island hold together till then?The intention of Pencroft and Cyrus Harding was to launch the vessel as soon as the hull should be complete.The deck, the upperworks, the interior woodwork and the rigging might be finished afterwards, but the essential point was that the colonists should have an assured refuge away from the island.Perhaps it might be even better to conduct the vessel to Port Balloon, that is to say, as far as possible from the center of eruption, for at the mouth of the Mercy, between the islet and the wall of granite, it would run the risk of being crushed in the event of any convulsion.All the exertions of the voyagers were therefore concentrated upon the completion of the hull."
"到了3月3日，预计再有十天就可以让船下水了。","Thus the 3rd of March arrived, and they might calculate upon launching the vessel in ten days."
"移民们心中又重拾了希望，他们在林肯岛上的第四个年头，经受起无数考验。就连一直为自己的领地遭到破坏和毁灭而闷闷不乐的潘克洛夫心情也好了不少。的确，他的希望是集中在船上的。","Hope revived in the hearts of the colonists, who had, in this fourth year of their sojourn on Lincoln island, suffered so many trials.Even Pencroft lost in some measure the somber taciturnity occasioned by the devastation and ruin of his domain.His hopes, it is true, were concentrated upon his vessel."
"“我们要完成它，”他对工程师说，“我们要完成它，队长，现在也正是时候，现在季节正在变换，快到秋分了。如果有必要的话，我们就要把船停在达抱岛过冬。还是先想想林肯岛，再考虑达抱岛吧。哎，真不幸啊！谁想得到会发生这样的事呢？”","“We shall finish it,” he said to the engineer, “we shall finish it, captain, and it is time, for the season is advancing and the equinox will soon be here.Well, if necessary, we must put in to Tabor island to spend the winter.But think of Tabor island after Lincoln Island.Ah, how unfortunate!Who could have believed it possible?”"
"“我们继续干吧。”工程师一如既往地回答。","“Let us get on,” was the engineer’s invariable reply."
"于是他们继续工作，分秒必争。","And they worked away without losing a moment."
"“船长，”过了几天纳布问道，“您觉得要是尼摩船长还活着，这一切还会发生吗？”","“Master,” asked Neb, a few days later, “do you think all this could have happened if Captain Nemo had been still alive?”"
"“当然会，纳布。”赛勒斯·哈丁回答道。","“Certainly, Neb,” answered Cyrus Harding."
"“我本人可不这么看！”潘克洛夫小声对纳布说。","“I, for one, don’t believe it!” whispered Pencroft to Neb."
"“我也是！”纳布严肃地说。","“Nor I!” answered Neb seriously."
"三月份的第一个星期，情况变得更危险了。上万条玻璃丝似的岩浆，下雨似的落到岛上。火山口的岩浆又开始沸腾，流到火山的后面。岩浆流沿着已经凝固了的凝灰岩表面流去，把第一次火山爆发后残存下来的几株干枯的树干都毁坏了。这次，岩浆流向格兰特湖的西南岸流过来，一直流过甘油河，侵入眺望岗的高地。这对移民们的事业来说是最后一次打击，这打击是相当可怕的。磨坊、内院的建筑和马厩都被毁坏了。受到惊吓的家禽向四面八方乱逃。托普和贾普表现出极度恐惧的样子，似乎它们的直觉警告它们灾难就要到来了。第一次爆发的时候，岛上就有很多动物死了。幸存下来的动物找不到避难之地，只能到沼泽地上，只有少数动物逃到眺望岗的高地上，把这里当收容所。但现在也没有他们的容身之处了，岩浆流沿着花岗石墙的边缘往海滩倾泄，形成一道火瀑。这壮观的景象是不能用言语形容的。在夜里，只能把它比作岩浆形成的尼亚加拉大瀑布，上面是水蒸汽，下面是沸腾的物质。","During the first week of March appearances again became menacing.Thousands of threads like glass, formed of fluid lava, fell like rain upon the island.The crater was again boiling with lava which overflowed the back of the volcano.The torrent flowed along the surface of the hardened tufa, and destroyed the few meager skeletons of trees which had withstood the first eruption.The stream, flowing this time towards the southwest shore of Lake Grant, stretched beyond Creek Glycerine, and invaded the plateau of Prospect Heights.This last blow to the work of the colonists was terrible.The mill, the buildings of the inner court, the stables, were all destroyed.The affrighted poultry fled in all directions.Top and Jup showed signs of the greatest alarm, as if their instinct warned them of an impending catastrophe.A large number of the animals of the island had perished in the first eruption.Those which survived found no refuge but Tadorn Marsh, save a few to which the plateau of Prospect Heights afforded asylum.But even this last retreat was now closed to them, and the lava-torrent, flowing over the edge of the granite wall, began to pour down upon the beach its cataracts of fire.The sublime horror of this spectacle passed all description.During the night it could only be compared to a Niagara of molten fluid, with its incandescent vapors above and its boiling masses below."
"移民们被赶到最后的堡垒里去了。虽然船上面的缝隙还没有填好，但他们决定让船立即下水。","The colonists were driven to their last entrenchment, and although the upper seams of the vessel were not yet calked, they decided to launch her at once."
"潘克洛夫和艾尔顿做好了下水所需的必要准备，新船下水就定在第二天，也就是3月9日的早晨。","Pencroft and Ayrton therefore set about the necessary preparations for the launching, which was to take place the morning of the next day, the 9th of March."
"但是3月8日夜晚，一股水蒸汽从火山口喷出来，像一根巨大的柱子一样，还发出了可怕的爆炸声，一直升到三千英尺以上的高空。“达卡洞”的墙壁在气体的压力下崩塌了，海水通过中央管道灌进火坑，立即化成水蒸汽。但是火山口不足以让水蒸汽完全排出。爆炸声震天动地，就是在一百英里以外也能听到。山上的碎岩石块飞进太平洋，几分钟后海水就漫过原来林肯岛所在的地方了。","But during the night of the 8th an enormous column of vapor escaping from the crater rose with frightful explosions to a height of more than three thousand feet.The wall of Dakkar Grotto had evidently given way under the pressure of gases, and the sea, rushing through the central shalt into the igneous gulf, was at once converted into vapor.But the crater could not afford a sufficient outlet for this vapor.An explosion, which might have been heard at a distance of a hundred miles, shook the air.Fragments of mountains fell into the Pacific, and, in a few minutes, the ocean rolled over the spot where Lincoln island once stood."
"第二十章","Chapter 20"
"一块孤立的石头，30英尺长，20英尺宽，几乎只高出水平面10英尺，这是唯一没有被太平洋的波涛淹没的地方。","An isolated rock, thirty feet in length, twenty in breadth, scarcely ten from the water’s edge, such was the only solid point which the waves of the Pacific had not engulfed."
"这就是花岗石宫仅存的一点！石墙匐然倒塌，砸成碎块，几块大一点的石头一个个堆叠起来，形成了这块陆地。所有周围的一切都消失在海洋深处：被炸成两半的富兰克林山的较低的火山锥、鲨鱼湾的熔岩口、眺望岗的高地、安全岛、气球港的花岗石、“达卡洞”的玄武岩，还有远离爆炸中心的狭长的盘蛇半岛。林肯岛现在能看到的只剩下这条狭长的岩石，现在这块岩石成了六个移民和托普的避难所。","It was all that remained of the structure of Granite House!The wall had fallen headlong and been then shattered to fragments, and a few of the rocks of the large room were piled one above another to form this point.All around had disappeared in the abyss; the inferior cone of Mount Franklin, rent asunder by the explosion; the lava jaws of Shark Gulf, the plateau of Prospect Heights, Safety Islet, the granite rocks of Port Balloon, the basalts of Dakkar Grotto, the long Serpentine Peninsula, so distant nevertheless from the center of the eruption.All that could now be seen of Lincoln Island was the narrow rock which now served as a refuge to the six colonists and their dog Top."
"动物们都在这场灾难中丧生了。鸟和岛上的几种代表性动物要么被压死，要么被淹死，不幸的贾普也被压在地下了。","The animals had also perished in the catastrophe; the birds, as well as those representing the fauna of the island—all either crushed or drowned, and the unfortunate Jup himself had, alas! found his death in some crevice of the soil."
"赛勒斯·哈丁、吉迪恩·史佩莱、赫伯特、潘克洛夫、纳布和艾尔顿幸存了下来，因为他们当时聚集在帐篷底下，当岛被炸得粉碎，碎块像雨点似的四处落下的时候，他们被抛到了海里。","If Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Pencroft, Neb, and Ayrton had survived, it was because, assembled under their tent, they had been hurled into the sea at the instant when the fragments of the island rained down on every side."
"他们浮到水面上时，只能看到半锚链外有一堆石头，他们就朝着石头游过来，在上面找到立足之地。","When they reached the surface they could only perceive, at half a cable’s length, this mass of rocks, towards which they swam and on which they found footing."
"他们在这堆光秃秃的石头上已经生存了九天了。从花岗石宫的仓库里带出的一些粮食和岩石低洼处流下的一些雨水支撑着这些不幸的移民们。他们最后的希望，也就是他们的船，也被砸成碎片。他们没办法离开礁石，没有火，也没有可以取火的方法。他们好像在劫难逃了。","On this barren rock they had now existed for nine days.A few provisions taken from the magazine of Granite House before the catastrophe, a little fresh water from the rain which had fallen in a hollow of the rock, was all that the unfortunate colonists possessed.Their last hope, the vessel, had been shattered to pieces.They had no means of quitting the reef; no fire, nor any means of obtaining it.It seemed that they must inevitably perish."
"虽然他们尽力节省，每天吃的只能勉强存活，但到3月18日，他们就只剩下两天的粮食了。他们所有的科学知识和聪明才智都无法改变目前的状况了。他们的命运掌握在上帝手中。","This day, the 18th of March, there remained only provisions for two days, although they limited their consumption to the bare necessaries of life.All their science and intelligence could avail them nothing in their present position.They were in the hand of God."
"赛勒斯·哈丁还是那么冷静，吉迪恩·史佩莱比较紧张，潘克洛夫满腹怨气，在礁石上踱来踱去。赫伯特一步也不离开工程师，好像想得到工程师的帮助，然而工程师也无计可施。纳布和艾尔顿只好听凭命运的安排。","Cyrus Harding was calm, Gideon Spilett more nervous, and Pencroft, a prey to sullen anger, walked to and fro on the rock.Herbert did not for a moment quit the engineer’s side, as if demanding from him that assistance he had no power to give.Neb and Ayrton were resigned to their fate."
"“哎，真是不幸！真是不幸啊！”潘克洛夫不停地说，“要是有个核桃壳把我们带到达抱岛就好了！但是我们什么也没有，什么也没有！”","“Ah, what a misfortune! what a misfortune!” often repeated Pencroft.“If we had but a walnut-shell to take us to Tabor Island!But we have nothing, nothing!”"
"“尼摩船长死得倒是时候。”纳布说道。","“Captain Nemo did right to die,” said Neb."
"在之后的五天里，赛勒斯·哈丁和他不幸的伙伴们十分小心地节约他们的粮食，吃的东西仅仅能使他们不至于饿死。他们的身体极度虚弱。赫伯特和纳布开始出现精神错乱的症状。","During the five ensuing days Cyrus Harding and his unfortunate companions husbanded their provisions with the most extreme care, eating only what would prevent them from dying of starvation.Their weakness was extreme.Herbert and Neb began to show symptoms of delirium."
"在这种情况下，他们还能保持一线希望吗？不可能！那他们唯一剩下的机会是什么呢？盼着有船出现在礁石视线范围内吗？但是根据经验，他们很清楚没有船会驶到太平洋的这一部分。他们能指望天意，恰巧这个时候苏格兰游船到达抱岛去找艾尔顿吗？那几乎是不可能的。再说，就算船真的到那儿，由于移民们并没有发出艾尔顿换了地址的通知，因此船长在搜遍整个达抱岛仍没有结果以后，就会回到纬度较低的地区去。","Under these circumstances was it possible for them to retain even the shadow of a hope?No!What was their sole remaining chance?That a vessel should appear in sight of the rock?But they knew only too well from experience that no ships ever visited this part of the Pacific.Could they calculate that, by a truly providential coincidence, the Scotch yacht would arrive precisely at this time in search of Ayrton at Tabor Island?It was scarcely probable; and, besides, supposing she should come there, as the colonists had not been able to deposit a notice pointing out Ayrton’s change of abode, the commander of the yacht, after having explored Tabor Island without results, would again set sail and return to lower latitudes."
"不！不可能有获救的机会了，可怕的死亡，他们只能在这堆礁石上等待饥渴，等待死亡。","No! no hope of being saved could be retained, and a horrible death, death from hunger and thirst, awaited them upon this rock."
"他们无精打采地躺在礁石上，对周围发生的事全然不知。只有艾尔顿还不时地用尽全身力气抬起头，绝望地看看荒漠一般的大海。","Already they were stretched on the rock, inanimate, and no longer conscious of what passed around them.Ayrton alone, by a supreme effort, from time to time raised his head, and cast a despairing glance over the desert ocean."
"3月24日早晨，艾尔顿的胳膊伸向水平线上的一个黑点。他撑起身来，先跪下来，然后站立起来，好像在用手发信号。","But on the morning of the 24th of March Ayrton’s arms were extended toward a point in the horizon; he raised himself, at first on his knees, then upright, and his hand seemed to make a signal."
"礁石附近出现了一艘船。它显然不是漫无目的。它开足马力，直对着礁石开过来。不幸的移民们如果有足够的精力观察海平面的话，几个小时前就可以看见它了。","A sail was in sight off the rock.She was evidently not without an object.The reef was the mark for which she was making in a direct line, under all steam, and the unfortunate colonists might have made her out some hours before if they had had the strength to watch the horizon."
"“‘邓肯’号！”艾尔顿喃喃地说，说完就倒在石头上不省人事了。","“The ‘Duncan’!” murmured Ayrton—and fell back without sign of life."
"赛勒斯·哈丁和他的伙伴们由于得到了悉心照料，苏醒过来。他们发现自己在一艘船的船舱里，全然不知自己是怎样死里逃生的。","When Cyrus Harding and his companions recovered consciousness, thanks to the attention lavished upon them, they found themselves in the cabin of a steamer, without being able to comprehend how they had escaped death."
"艾尔顿的话解释了一切。","A word from Ayrton explained everything."
"“‘邓肯’号！”他喃喃地说。","“The ‘Duncan’!” he murmured."
"“是‘邓肯’号！”赛勒斯·哈丁大喊起来。他把手举向天空说：“啊！全能的上帝啊！您的慈悲拯救了我们！”","“The ‘Duncan’!” exclaimed Cyrus Harding.And raising his hand to Heaven, he said, “Oh!Almighty God! mercifully hast Thou preserved us!”"
"是的，的确，这是“邓肯”号，格里那凡爵士的游船。现在格兰特船长的儿子罗伯特指挥着“邓肯”号，奉命来到达抱岛接已经赎罪满十二年的艾尔顿回国。","It was, in fact, the “Duncan,” Lord Glenarvan’s yacht, now commanded by Robert, son of Captain Grant, who had been despatched to Tabor Island to find Ayrton, and bring him back to his native land alter twelve years of expiation."
"移民们不仅获救了，而且还在回国的路上。","The colonists were not only saved, but already on the way to their native country."
"“格兰特船长，”赛勒斯·哈丁问道，“您在达抱岛上没有找到艾尔顿，是谁建议您来东北一百英里以外的地方来呢？”","“Captain Grant,” asked Cyrus Harding, “who can have suggested to you the idea, after having left Tabor Island, where you did not find Ayrton, of coming a hundred miles farther northeast?”"
"“哈丁队长，”罗伯特·格兰特回答道，“我不仅是奉命来找艾尔顿，而且还为了找您和您的伙伴们。”","“Captain Harding,” replied Robert Grant, “it was in order to find, not only Ayrton, but yourself and your companions.”"
"“我和我的伙伴们？”","“My companions and myself?”"
"“毫无疑问，你们在林肯岛。”","“Doubtless, at Lincoln Island.”"
"“在林肯岛？”吉迪恩·史佩莱、赫伯特、纳布和潘克洛夫十分诧异大喊起来。","“At Lincoln Island!” exclaimed in a breath Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Neb, and Pencroft, in the highest degree astonished."
"“您是怎么知道有个林肯岛呢？”赛勒斯·哈丁问道，“航海地图上甚至都没有它的名字。”","“How could you be aware of the existence of Lincoln Island?” inquired Cyrus Harding, “it is not even named in the charts.”"
"“我是看了你们留在达抱岛的信后知道的。”罗伯特·格兰特回答道。","“I knew of it from a document left by you on Tabor Island,” answered Robert Grant."
"“一封信！”吉迪恩·史佩莱大声问道。","“A document!” cried Gideon Spilett."
"“没错儿，信就在这儿，”罗伯特·格兰特一边说着，一边拿出一张标着林肯岛经纬度的纸条来，“这上面写着艾尔顿和五个美国移民的所在地。”","“Without doubt, and here it is,” answered Robert Grant, producing a paper which indicated the longitude and latitude of Lincoln Island, “the present residence of Ayrton and five American colonists.”"
"“是尼摩船长！”赛勒斯·哈丁看了那张字条大喊道，发现信的笔迹和畜栏那张纸条的一样。","“It is Captain Nemo!” cried Cyrus Harding, after having read the notice, and recognized that the handwriting was similar to that of the paper found at the corral."
"“啊！”潘克洛夫说，“那么是尼摩船长驾着我们的‘乘风破浪号’一个人冒险到达抱岛去的！”","“Ah!” said Pencroft, “it was then he who took our ‘Bonadventure’ and hazarded himself alone to go to Tabor Island!”"
"“就是为了去留下这封信。”赫伯特补充道。","“In order to leave this notice,” added Herbert."
"“我说得没有错，”水手大声说道，“尼摩船长死了以后，还为我们提供了最后一次帮助。”","“I was then right in saying,” exclaimed the sailor, “that even after his death the captain would render us a last service.”"
"“我的朋友们，”赛勒斯·哈丁非常激动地说，“但愿仁慈的上帝怜悯我们的恩人尼摩船长的灵魂。”","“My friends,” said Cyrus Harding, in a voice of the profoundest emotion, “may the God of mercy have had pity on the soul of Captain Nemo, our benefactor.”"
"赛勒斯·哈丁说到最后的时候，移民们都摘下帽子，小声默念尼摩船长的名字。","The colonists uncovered themselves at these last words of Cyrus Harding, and murmured the name of Captain Nemo."
"然后艾尔顿走到工程师身边，简单地说：“这只保险箱放到哪儿呢？”","Then Ayrton, approaching the engineer, said simply, “Where should this coffer be deposited?”"
"这只保险箱是荒岛下沉的时候，艾尔顿冒着生命危险保存下来的。现在他忠实地把他交给工程师。","It was the coffer which Ayrton had saved at the risk of his life, at the very instant that the island had been engulfed, and which he now faithfully handed to the engineer."
"“艾尔顿！艾尔顿！”赛勒斯·哈丁被深深地打动了。于是，他对罗伯特·格兰特说，“先生，”他补充说道，“你们抛弃的是一个罪犯，现在他已经经过忏悔，变成了一个诚实的人，我和他握手感到很骄傲。”","“Ayrton!Ayrton!” said Cyrus Harding, deeply touched.Then, addressing Robert Grant, “Sir,” he added, “you left behind you a criminal; you find in his place a man who has become honest by penitence, and whose hand I am proud to clasp in mine.”"
"罗伯特·格兰特现在知道了尼摩船长的离奇经历和移民们在林肯岛上的情况。然后，他们观测了这片剩下的浅滩，今后它就会标在太平洋的地图上了。观测完后，船长下令起航。","Robert Grant was now made acquainted with the strange history of Captain Nemo and the colonists of Lincoln Island.Then, observation being taken of what remained of this shoal, which must henceforward figure on the charts of the Pacific, the order was given to make all sail."
"几个星期后，移民们到达了美国大陆。他们发现经过一场残酷的斗争后，真理和正义获得胜利，他们的国家比以前更和平了。","A few weeks afterwards the colonists landed in America, and found their country once more at peace alter the terrible conflict in which right and justice had triumphed."
"至于尼摩船长留下的一箱财宝，林肯岛上的移民们用其中的一大部分在爱荷华州购买了一大片土地。他们留下这些财宝里最好的一颗珍珠，以被“邓肯”号救回祖国的遇难者的名义将其送给了格里那凡夫人。","Of the treasures contained in the coffer left by Captain Nemo to the colonists of Lincoln Island, the larger portion was employed in the purchase of a vast territory in the State of Iowa.One pearl alone, the finest, was reserved from the treasure and sent to Lady Glenarvan in the name of the castaways restored to their country by the “Duncan.”"
"移民们在这片领地上开始劳动，也就是说，追求富有和幸福，奉献着他们在林肯岛的热情。他们开辟了一块广阔的居住地，并用沉没在太平洋里的荒岛这个名字来命名。这里的一条河就叫做“慈悲河”，一座山叫做“富兰克林山”，一个湖名为“格兰特湖”，森林名为“远西森林”。这里成了陆地上的岛屿。","There, upon this domain, the colonists invited to labor, that is to say, to wealth and happiness, all those to whom they had hoped to offer the hospitality of Lincoln Island.There was founded a vast colony to which they gave the name of that island sunk beneath the waters of the Pacific.A river there was called the Mercy, a mountain took the name of Mount Franklin, a small lake was named Lake Grant, and the forests became the forests of the Far West.It might have been an island on terra firma."
"在工程师和他的伙伴们勤劳智慧双手的劳动下，一切都欣欣向荣。过去林肯岛的移民们一个也不缺，他们发誓要永远在一起。纳布和他的主人在一起，艾尔顿随时准备为集体奉献自己，潘克洛夫当农民比以前当水手更像样，赫伯特在赛勒斯·哈丁的教育下完成了学业，吉迪恩·史佩莱创办了《林肯岛先驱报》，它成了世界上消息最灵通的报纸。","There, under the intelligent hands of the engineer and his companions, everything prospered.Not one of the former colonists of Lincoln Island was absent, for they had sworn to live always together.Neb was with his master; Ayrton was there ready to sacrifice himself for all; Pencroft was more a farmer than he had ever been a sailor; Herbert, who completed his studies under the superintendence of Cyrus Harding, and Gideon Spilett, who founded the New Lincoln Herald, the best-informed journal in the world."
"赛勒斯·哈丁和他的伙伴们每隔一段时间就会接待来访的客人。其中有格里那凡爵士及其夫人、约翰·芒格拉斯船长及其夫人玛丽·格兰特、罗伯特·格兰特、麦克纳布斯少校以及其他和格兰特船长和尼摩船长有关的人。","There Cyrus Harding and his companions received at intervals visits from Lord and Lady Glenarvan, Captain John Mangles and his wife, the sister of Robert Grant, Robert Grant himself, Major McNab, and all those who had taken part in the history both of Captain Grant and Captain Nemo."
"总的说来，所有人都很幸福，他们现在和过去一样紧密地团结在一起。但是他们谁也不会忘记那个岛，他们初到那里时一无所有，无依无靠，四年的生活下来，他们在岛上什么也不缺少了。现在那里只是一堆被太平洋波涛冲击的花岗岩碎石，只是尼摩船长的坟墓。","There, to conclude, all were happy, united in the present as they had been in the past; but never could they forget that island upon which they had arrived poor and friendless, that island which, during four years had supplied all their wants, and of which there remained but a fragment of granite washed by the waves of the Pacific, the tomb of him who had borne the name of Captain Nemo."
