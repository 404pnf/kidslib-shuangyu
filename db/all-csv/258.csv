"你摸了我","You Touched Me"
"作者：D. H. 劳伦斯","by D. H. Lawrence"
"陶屋是幢丑陋的方方正正的砖房，四周围着墙。围墙把整个陶器作坊的所有场院也都围了起来。当然，有一道女贞树的树篱将陶屋及其小院围住，与陶器作坊的场院和工厂隔开了，但也只是部分隔开而已。穿过树篱，可以看到已荒废的场院，以及有着很多窗户、像工厂模样的陶器作坊。从树篱上看，可以看到一座座的烟囱和附属的小房子。但在树篱墙内，怡人的花园和草地顺坡而下，延伸至一个边上长有柳树的水塘。这水塘曾经为工厂提供水源。","The Pottery House was a square, ugly, brick house girt in by the wall that enclosed the whole grounds of the pottery itself.To be sure, a privet hedge partly masked the house and its ground from the pottery-yard and works: but only partly.Through the hedge could be seen the desolate yard, and the many-windowed, factory-like pottery, over the hedge could be seen the chimneys and the outhouses.But inside the hedge, a pleasant garden and lawn sloped down to a willow pool, which had once supplied the works."
"陶器作坊现已停工，场院的大门也长期关闭着。再也没有有黄色稻草露在外面的巨大板条箱成堆地堆在包装棚旁了。再也没有高头大马拉着满载货物的大车沿山坡而下了。再也看不到那些穿着黏土色工作服、脸上和头发上溅满了小块灰色泥巴的制陶少女，看不到她们和男人们嬉戏、大声尖叫的情景了。一切都消逝了。","The Pottery itself was now closed, the great doors of the yard permanently shut.No more the great crates with yellow straw showing through, stood in stacks by the packing shed.No more the drays drawn by great horses rolled down the hill with a high load.No more the pottery-lasses in their clay-coloured overalls, their faces and hair splashed with grey fine mud, shrieked and larked with the men.All that was over."
"“我们更想——嗯，更想——安静点儿。”马狄尔达·罗克利说道。","‘We like it much better—oh, much better—quieter,’ said Matilda Rockley."
"“嗯，是的。”她的妹妹埃米·罗克利附和道。","‘Oh, yes,’ assented Emmie Rockley, her sister."
"“我相信你们是这样想的。”来客也附和着说。","‘I’m sure you do,’ agreed the visitor."
"但这两个罗克利家的姑娘是真的这样想，还是她们只是想象她们更喜欢安静一点，那就不得而知了。当灰色的黏土不再溅得到处都是污泥，也不再把淤泥淤塞在房上，她们的生活的确变得更灰暗、更枯燥了。如今，她们还没有完全意识到自己是多么想念那些女孩们，那些她们曾经极为熟悉、同时也极为讨厌的、不停尖叫和吵闹的制陶少女们。","But whether the two Rockley girls really liked it better, or whether they only imagined they did, is a question.Certainly their lives were much more grey and dreary now that the grey clay had ceased to spatter its mud and silt its dust over the premises.They did not quite realize how they missed the shrieking, shouting lasses, whom they had known all their lives and disliked so much."
"马狄尔达和埃米都是老姑娘了。在一个完全工业化的地区，对于期望值超过普通人的姑娘来说，找个丈夫并不容易。这座难看的工业城镇里到处都是男人，且都是已到适婚年龄的年轻男人。但他们不是矿工就是陶工，都只是工人而已。罗克利家的姑娘们在她们父亲去世后每人可得到大约1万英镑：价值1万英镑、可获利的房产。这可不是区区小数：她们非常沉着镇定，克制着不让这笔财富轻易落入任何一个普通的无产者的囊中。结果，银行职员或是新教牧师，甚至学校教师都没能脱颖而出。马狄尔达已经开始对离开陶屋不抱有任何想法了。","Matilda and Emmie were already old maids.In a thorough industrial district, it is not easy for the girls who have expectations above the common to find husbands.The ugly industrial town was full of men, young men who were ready to marry.But they were all colliers or pottery-hands, mere workmen.The Rockley girls would have about ten thousand pounds each when their father died: ten thousand pounds’ worth of profitable house-property.It was not to be sneezed at: they felt so themselves, and refrained from sneezing away such a fortune on any mere member of the proletariat.Consequently, bank-clerks or nonconformist clergymen or even school-teachers having failed to come forward, Matilda had begun to give up all idea of ever leaving the Pottery House."
"马狄尔达是个身材高挑、苗条，举止优雅的漂亮女孩，只是鼻子很大。如果说埃米是马大，那么马狄尔达就是马利亚，也就是说，马狄尔达喜欢绘画和音乐，读过很多小说，而埃米则负责操持家务。埃米比姐姐矮一些、壮一些，没有什么才艺。她很尊敬姐姐马狄尔达，因为姐姐天生端庄优雅、明白事理。","Matilda was a tall, thin, graceful fair girl, with a rather large nose.She was the Mary to Emmie’s Martha: that is, Matilda loved painting and music, and read a good many novels, whilst Emmie looked after the house-keeping.Emmie was shorter, plumper than her sister, and she had no accomplishments.She looked up to Matilda, whose mind was naturally refined and sensible."
"两个姑娘平静而郁郁寡欢地生活着，倒也过得心满意足。她们的母亲过世了。父亲也病了。父亲是个精明的人，以前受过一些教育，但他更愿意把自己当成劳动人民中的一员。他热爱音乐，小提琴拉得很好。但现在他日益衰老，病得很重，肾病将他折磨得奄奄一息。他曾经喝威士忌喝得很凶。","In their quiet, melancholy way, the two girls were happy.Their mother was dead.Their father was ill also.He was an intelligent man who had had some education, but preferred to remain as if he were one with the rest of the working people.He had a passion for music and played the violin pretty well.But now he was getting old, he was very ill, dying of a kidney disease.He had been rather a heavy whisky-drinker."
"这个平静的家庭还雇了一个女佣，一家人年复一年地生活在陶屋里。朋友们来访时，姑娘们便出去，父亲则更放肆地酗酒，病得越来越严重。外面的街道上，矿工们的喧嚣声、狗吠声、孩子们的哭闹声不绝于耳。但在陶器作坊的墙内却如同荒芜之地一般冷冷清清。","This quiet household, with one servant-maid, lived on year after year in the Pottery House.Friends came in, the girls went out, the father drank himself more and more ill.Outside in the street there was a continual racket of the colliers and their dogs and children.But inside the pottery wall was a deserted quiet."
"这个家有一点美中不足之处。姑娘们的父亲特德·罗克利先生有四个女儿，却没有儿子。随着女儿们长大成人，他发现自己在家总是被女人们包围着，感觉十分恼火。于是他去伦敦一个福利机构领养了一个男孩。当父亲领着他的小神童——这个叫哈德里安的6岁男孩——回到家时，埃米14岁，马狄尔达16岁了。","In all this ointment there was one little fly.Ted Rockley, the father of the girls, had had four daughters, and no son.As his girls grew, he felt angry at finding himself always in a house-hold of women.He went off to London and adopted a boy out of a Charity Institution.Emmie was fourteen years old, and Matilda sixteen, when their father arrived home with his prodigy, the boy of six, Hadrian."
"哈德里安是来自福利院的一个普通男孩，一头普普通通的棕色头发，一双普普通通的浅蓝色眼睛，连浓浓的伦敦腔也是普普通通的。罗克利家的姑娘们——他到来时还有三个没出嫁——对他的突然出现有些怨恨。他凭借着在福利机构培养的警觉性，马上意识到了这一点。他虽然只有6岁，但当他看着这三个年轻女人时，脸上总是带着一丝难以察觉的、嘲弄的神情。她们坚持让他叫表姐：弗洛拉表姐，马狄尔达表姐，埃米表姐。他照做了，但腔调里似乎总带着一丝嘲弄。","Hadrian was just an ordinary boy from a Charity Home, with ordinary brownish hair and ordinary bluish eyes and of ordinary rather cockney speech.The Rockley girls—there were three at home at the time of his arrival—had resented his being sprung on them.He, with his watchful, charity-institution instinct, knew this at once.Though he was only six years old, Hadrian had a subtle, jeering look on his face when he regarded the three young women.They insisted he should address them as Cousin: Cousin Flora, Cousin Matilda, Cousin Emmie.He complied, but there seemed a mockery in his tone."
"可是，姑娘们本性还是善良的。弗洛拉嫁人离开了家。虽然她们有些严厉，但哈德里却总是按照自己的意愿对待马狄尔达和埃米。他在陶屋里、陶屋的房前屋后渐渐长大了。他上了小学，人们都叫他哈德里安·罗克利。他对待马狄尔达表姐和埃米表姐有点冷淡、说话言简意赅；他行事一贯低调、少言寡语。姑娘们叫他小滑头，但他不是那样的人。他只是很谨慎，不够直率。他的叔叔特德·罗克利和他有着心照不宣的默契，因为他们的性情有些相似。哈德里安和这位上了年纪的男人彼此间互相尊重，但缺乏感情。","The girls, however, were kind-hearted by nature.Flora married and left home.Hadrian did very much as he pleased with Matilda and Emmie, though they had certain strictnesses.He grew up in the Pottery House and about the Pottery premises, went to an elementary school, and was invariably called Hadrian Rockley.He regarded Cousin Matilda and Cousin Emmie with a certain laconic indifference, was quiet and reticent in his ways.The girls called him sly, but that was unjust.He was merely cautious, and without frankness.His Uncle, Ted Rockley, understood him tacitly, their natures were somewhat akin.Hadrian and the elderly man had a real but unemotional regard for one another."
"这男孩13岁时被送到了县城里的一所中学去。他并不喜欢。马狄尔达表姐希望把他塑造成一个小绅士，但遭到了他的拒绝。当别人强制性地调教他成为一个温文尔雅的人时，他会略带轻蔑地撇一下嘴，然后带着福利院儿童特有的羞涩，咧嘴一笑。他在中学时经常逃学，把书籍、带着校徽的帽子，甚至自己的围巾和手帕卖给同学，然后带着钱不知道跑到哪儿鬼混去了。所以那两年他过得很不愉快。","When he was thirteen years old the boy was sent to a High School in the County town.He did not like it.His Cousin Matilda had longed to make a little gentleman of him, but he refused to be made.He would give a little contemptuous curve to his lip, and take on a shy, charity-boy grin, when refinement was thrust upon him.He played truant from the High School, sold his books, his cap with its badge, even his very scarf and pocket-handkerchief, to his school-fellows, and went raking off heaven knows where with the money.So he spent two very unsatisfactory years."
"15岁时，他宣布他要离开英格兰去殖民地。他一直和福利院保持着联系。罗克利一家知道，当哈德里安以他平静、半嘲弄的方式宣布什么时，反对他一点都没用，甚至会适得其反。所以最后他在他曾呆过的福利院的护送下去了加拿大，离开了这个家。他对罗克利一家一句感谢的话都没说就道别走了，似乎没有一丝痛苦。马狄尔达和埃米想到他离开家的情景常常落泪：甚至她们父亲的脸上也会浮现一丝古怪的神情。但哈德里安会经常从加拿大写信回来。他已经进了蒙特利尔附近的某个电厂工作，而且干得不错。","When he was fifteen he announced that he wanted to leave England and go to the Colonies.He had kept touch with the Home.The Rockleys knew that, when Hadrian made a declaration, in his quiet, half-jeering manner, it was worse than useless to oppose him.So at last the boy departed, going to Canada under the protection of the Institution to which he had belonged.He said good-bye to the Rockleys without a word of thanks, and parted, it seemed, without a pang.Matilda and Emmie wept often to think of how he left them: even on their father’s face a queer look came.But Hadrian wrote fairly regularly from Canada.He had entered some electricity works near Montreal, and was doing well."
"但后来，战争爆发了。接着，哈德里安应召入伍，来到了欧洲。罗克利家的人连他的影子都没看到。他们还住在陶屋里，像往常一样生活。特德·罗克利得了一种浮肿病，奄奄一息。他心里很想见见这个男孩。签署停战协议后，哈德里安放了长假。他写信说打算回家，回陶屋来。","At last, however, the war came.In his turn, Hadrian joined up and came to Europe.The Rockleys saw nothing of him.They lived on, just the same, in the Pottery House.Ted Rockley was dying of a sort of dropsy, and in his heart he wanted to see the boy.When the armistice was signed, Hadrian had a long leave, and wrote that he was coming home to the Pottery House."
"姑娘们非常焦躁不安。说实话，她们有点怕哈德里安。高高瘦瘦的马狄尔达身体虚弱；两姐妹为照顾父亲已经精疲力尽了。而现在，21岁的哈德里安——那个五年前冷漠地离开他们的年轻人——现在要和他们住在同一幢房子里，实在让人难受。","The girls were terribly fluttered.To tell the truth, they were a little afraid of Hadrian.Matilda, tall and thin, was frail in her health, both girls were worn with nursing their father.To have Hadrian, a young man of twenty-one, in the house with them, after he had left them so coldly five years before, was a trying circumstance."
"她们忐忑不安。埃米最终说服了父亲住到楼下的晨间起居室，而把他在楼上的房间留给哈德里安住。安排好这事后，正当她们还在为他的到来做其他准备的时候，上午十点钟，这个年轻人突然出现在她们面前，相当出人意料。当时，埃米表姐的头发一缕缕地搭在前额上，上下跳动，样子十分可笑，她正忙着擦楼梯毯的压条。而马狄尔达表姐正在厨房用肥皂水洗客厅的装饰品，她细细的胳膊上袖子高高挽起，用抹布包住的头发显得古怪而轻佻。","They were in a flutter.Emmie persuaded her father to have his bed made finally in the morning-room downstairs, whilst his room upstairs was prepared for Hadrian.This was done, and preparations were going on for the arrival, when, at ten o’clock in the morning the young man suddenly turned up, quite unexpectedly.Cousin Emmie, with her hair bobbed up in absurd little bobs round her forehead, was busily polishing the stair-rods, while Cousin Matilda was in the kitchen washing the drawing-room ornaments in a lather, her sleeves rolled back on her thin arms, and her head tied up oddly and coquettishly in a duster."
"当这个沉着冷静的年轻人带着行囊走进来，并把帽子放在缝纫机上时，马狄尔达表姐因羞愧而满脸通红。他个子矮小，但很自信。从他异常整洁的穿着上还能看出他来自福利院。他的脸呈棕色，脸上留了撮小胡子；他虽身材矮小，但却显得精力旺盛。","Cousin Matilda blushed deep with mortification when the self-possessed young man walked in with his kit-bag, and put his cap on the sewing machine.He was little and self-confident, with a curious neatness about him that still suggested the Charity Institution.His face was brown, he had a small moustache, he was vigorous enough in his smallness."
"“呀，这不是哈德里安吗！”马狄尔达表姐惊叫道，同时挤掉手上的泡沫。“我们以为你明天才到呢。”","‘Well, is it Hadrian!’ exclaimed Cousin Matilda, wringing the lather off her hand.‘We didn’t expect you till tomorrow.’"
"“我周一晚上下的车。”哈德里安边说边打量着房子。","‘I got off Monday night,’ said Hadrian, glancing round the room."
"“真没想到！”马狄尔达表姐说。然后，她擦干手，走上前，伸出手说：","‘Fancy!’ said Cousin Matilda.Then, having dried her hands, she went forward, held out her hand, and said:"
"“你好吗？”","‘How are you?’"
"“很好，谢谢。”哈德里安说。","‘Quite well, thank you,’ said Hadrian."
"“你是个男子汉了。”马狄尔达表姐说。","‘You’re quite a man,’ said Cousin Matilda."
"哈德里安打量了她一眼。她没有表现出最美的一面：太瘦，鼻子太大，还用个粉白相间的方格抹布裹着头。她意识到自己形象不佳。但她已经经历过太多痛苦和悲伤，所以她一点也不在意。","Hadrian glanced at her.She did not look her best: so thin, so large-nosed, with that pink-and-white checked duster tied round her head.She felt her disadvantage.But she had had a good deal of suffering and sorrow, she did not mind any more."
"仆人走了进来——她并不认识哈德里安。","The servant entered—one that did not know Hadrian."
"“去看看我的父亲吧。”马狄尔达表姐说。","‘Come and see my father,’ said Cousin Matilda."
"在大厅里，他们的突然出现使埃米表姐惊得像揭去了掩护物的山鹑。她正在楼梯上把颜色鲜亮的楼梯毯压条推回原位。她用手本能地扶着那些小把手，额前的头发上下摆动。","In the hall they roused Cousin Emmie like a partridge from cover.She was on the stairs pushing the bright stair-rods into place.Instinctively her hand went to the little knobs, her front hair bobbed on her forehead."
"“哎呀！”她没好气地喊道，“你怎么今天就来了？”","‘Why!’ she exclaimed, crossly.‘What have you come today for?’"
"“我早了一天下车。”哈德里安说。他的男性嗓音如此深沉，让人出人意料，使埃米表姐为之一震。","‘I got off a day earlier,’ said Hadrian, and his man’s voice so deep and unexpected was like a blow to Cousin Emmie."
"“哼，你刚才撞见我们忙成一团了。”她恨恨地说。然后，三个人走进了中间的房间。","‘Well, you’ve caught us in the midst of it,’ she said, with resentment.Then all three went into the middle room."
"罗克利先生已经穿戴整齐——也就是穿上了裤子和袜子——但他正躺在床上休息。床靠在窗户下面，这样他可以透过窗户看到他心爱的姹紫嫣红的花园，那里郁金香和苹果树花团锦簇、绚丽多彩。他看起来并没有实际上病得那么严重，因为他只是身体水肿，脸上气色正常。他的肚子肿胀得很厉害。他迅速瞥了一眼，头都没转，只是转了一下眼睛。他曾经长相英俊、体格健壮，现在却憔悴得只剩下了个躯壳。","Mr. Rockley was dressed—that is, he had on his trousers and socks—but he was resting on the bed, propped up just under the window, from whence he could see his beloved and resplendent garden, where tulips and apple-trees were ablaze.He did not look as ill as he was, for the water puffed him up, and his face kept its colour.His stomach was much swollen.He glanced round swiftly, turning his eyes without turning his head.He was the wreck of a handsome, well-built man."
"看见哈德里安，他脸上浮现出一丝古怪而勉强的微笑。年轻人温顺地向他问候。","Seeing Hadrian, a queer, unwilling smile went over his face.The young man greeted him sheepishly."
"“你不会一辈子都当士兵。”他说，“你想吃点什么吗？”","‘You wouldn’t make a life-guardsman,’ he said.‘Do you want something to eat?’"
"哈德里安看看周围——好像在找吃的东西。","Hadrian looked round—as if for the meal."
"“随便吧。”他说。","‘I don’t mind,’ he said."
"“你要吃什么——鸡蛋和熏肉？”埃米立刻问道。","‘What shall you have—egg and bacon?’ asked Emmie shortly."
"“行，随便吧。”哈德里安说。","‘Yes, I don’t mind,’ said Hadrian."
"姐妹俩去了厨房，并派仆人去把楼梯那边的活干完。","The sisters went down to the kitchen, and sent the servant to finish the stairs."
"“他变样了吧？”马狄尔达小声说。","‘Isn’t he altered?’ said Matilda, sotto voce."
"“可不是嘛！”埃米表姐说，“真是个小男人！”","‘Isn’t he!’ said Cousin Emmie.‘What a little man!’"
"她俩都做了个鬼脸，神经兮兮地笑了起来。","They both made a grimace, and laughed nervously."
"“把煎锅拿来。”埃米对马狄尔达说。","‘Get the frying-pan,’ said Emmie to Matilda."
"“但他还跟以前一样高傲。”马狄尔达递过煎锅时一边说，一边还眯起了眼睛，故意摇了摇头。","‘But he’s as cocky as ever,’ said Matilda, narrowing her eyes and shaking her head knowingly, as she handed the frying-pan."
"“小男人！”埃米讽刺道。她显然对哈德里安羽翼初丰、自以为是的男子气没有好感。","‘Mannie!’ said Emmie sarcastically.Hadrian’s new-fledged, cock-sure manliness evidently found no favour in her eyes."
"“噢，他并不坏。”马狄尔达说，“你不要对他怀有偏见。”","‘Oh, he’s not bad,’ said Matilda.‘You don’t want to be prejudiced against him.’"
"“我没有对他怀有偏见，我觉得从外表上看他还不错，”埃米说道，“但是他身上小男人气太重了。”","I’m not prejudiced against him, I think he’s all right for looks,’ said Emmie, ‘but there’s too much of the little mannie about him.’"
"“没想到撞到我们这副样子。”马狄尔达说。","‘Fancy catching us like this,’ said Matilda."
"“他们不会有什么想法的。”埃米轻蔑地说，“你上楼去换衣服吧，我们的马狄尔达。我一点儿也不在乎他。我来做这些活儿，你去和他说话。我可不去。”","‘They’ve no thought for anything,’ said Emmie with contempt.‘You go up and get dressed, our Matilda.I don’t care about him.I can see to things, and you can talk to him.I shan’t.’"
"“他要和父亲谈。”马狄尔达意味深长地说道。","‘He’ll talk to my father,’ said Matilda, meaningful."
"“狡猾——！”埃米一边叫着，一边做了个鬼脸。","‘Sly—!’ exclaimed Emmie, with a grimace."
"姐妹俩相信哈德里安回来是希望从他们父亲身上得到些什么——希望得到遗产。而她们根本不能确定他不会得到遗产。","The sisters believed that Hadrian had come hoping to get something out of their father—hoping for a legacy.And they were not at all sure he would not get it."
"马狄尔达上楼去换衣服。她已经想清楚了要怎样接待哈德里安，怎样给他留下深刻印象。而他竟撞见她用抹布包着头发的样子；细细的胳膊还泡在满是肥皂水的盆里。但是她并不在意。现在，她非常精心地打扮着自己，小心翼翼地盘起自己长长的、漂亮的金发；她在苍白的脸上涂上一层淡淡的胭脂，再把长长的精致水晶珠链系在柔软的绿色连衣裙上。现在她看起来优雅动人，就像一幅杂志插图上的女主人公一样，美得几乎不太真实。","Matilda went upstairs to change.She had thought it all out how she would receive Hadrian, and impress him.And he had caught her with her head tied up in a duster, and her thin arms in a basin of lather.But she did not care.She now dressed herself most scrupulously, carefully folded her long, beautiful, blonde hair, touched her pallor with a little rouge, and put her long string of exquisite crystal beads over her soft green dress.Now she looked elegant, like a heroine in a magazine illustration, and almost as unreal."
"她发现哈德里安和她父亲还在交谈。这个年轻人一般很少说话，但和“叔叔”在一起时却很有话聊。两人一边饮着一杯白兰地，一边抽着烟，就像一对老朋友一样闲聊着。哈德里安正在讲述自己在加拿大时的事情。他休完假就会回到那里去。","She found Hadrian and her father talking away.The young man was short of speech as a rule, but he could find his tongue with his ‘uncle’.They were both sipping a glass of brandy, and smoking, and chatting like a pair of old cronies.Hadrian was telling about Canada.He was going back there when his leave was up."
"“那么，你不愿意留在英格兰？”罗克利先生问。","‘You wouldn’t like to stop in England, then?’ said Mr. Rockley."
"“是的，我不愿留在英格兰。”哈德里安答道。","‘No, I wouldn’t stop in England,’ said Hadrian."
"“为什么呢？这儿有很多电工。”罗克利先生说。","‘How’s that?There’s plenty of electricians here,’ said Mr. Rockley."
"“是的，但是这里的雇工和雇主之间的差别太大了——对我来说太大了。”哈德里安说道。","‘Yes. But there’s too much difference between the men and the employers over here—too much of that for me,’ said Hadrian."
"病人仔细地看着他，眼里带着一丝古怪的笑意。","The sick man looked at him narrowly, with oddly smiling eyes."
"“就因为这个，是吗？”他回答。","‘That’s it, is it?’ he replied."
"马狄尔达听了他们的谈话，明白了他的意思。“所以那就是你的大主意，是吧，我的小男人。”她自言自语道。她以前总说哈德里安对任何人或事都缺少应有的尊重，说他狡猾而庸俗。她下楼去厨房和埃米说悄悄话。","Matilda heard and understood.‘So that’s your big idea, is it, my little man,’ she said to herself.She had always said of Hadrian that he had no proper respect for anybody or anything, that he was sly and common.She went down to the kitchen for a sotto voce confab with Emmie."
"“他觉得自己可了不起了！”她低声说。","‘He thinks a rare lot of himself!’ she whispered."
"“他是个大人物，他可真是啊！”埃米轻蔑地说。","‘He’s somebody, he is!’ said Emmie with contempt."
"“他认为这儿的雇主和雇工之间差别太大了。”马狄尔达说。","‘He thinks there’s too much difference between masters and men, over here,’ said Matilda."
"“在加拿大就没有任何差别吗？”埃米问。","‘Is it any different in Canada?’ asked Emmie."
"“嗯，是的——是民主的。”马蒂尔达回答，“他认为在那儿人人都平等。”","‘Oh, yes—democratic,’ replied Matilda, ‘He thinks they’re all on a level over there.’"
"“唉，好吧，他现在可是在这儿，”埃米冷冷地说道，“所以他就该安守本分。”","‘Ay, well he’s over here now,’ said Emmie dryly, ‘so he can keep his place.’"
"她们谈话的时候，看见那年轻人正在花园里闲逛，随意地看着花。他把手插在口袋里，头上端端正正地戴着士兵帽。他看起来非常悠闲自在，好像拥有这里的一切一样。两个姑娘焦虑不安，透过窗户盯着他。","As they talked they saw the young man sauntering down the garden, looking casually at the flowers.He had his hands in his pockets, and his soldier’s cap neatly on his head.He looked quite at his ease, as if in possession.The two women, fluttered, watched him through the window."
"“我们知道他是为了什么来的。”埃米粗鲁地说道。而马狄尔达则长时间盯着那个穿着整齐的卡其布服装的身影。那个身影仍然透出福利院男孩的气质，但现在那已经是个男人的身影，短小精悍，浑身透着一股蛮力。她想起他和她父亲谈到对有产阶级的抨击时，他激动的语调里夹杂着嘲弄。","‘We know what he’s come for,’ said Emmie, churlishly.Matilda looked a long time at the neat khaki figure.It had something of the charity-boy about it still; but now it was a man’s figure, laconic, charged with plebeian energy.She thought of the derisive passion in his voice as he had declaimed against the propertied classes, to her father."
"“你不了解，埃米。或许他不是为了那个而来的。”她驳斥妹妹道。她们都在想着钱的事。","‘You don’t know, Emmie.Perhaps he’s not come for that,’ she rebuked her sister.They were both thinking of the money."
"她们还在盯着那个年轻的士兵。他远远地站在花园的尽头，背对着她们，手插在口袋里，看着那个边上长满柳树的水塘。马狄尔达深蓝色的眼睛里有种奇怪的神色，饱含深意。她那透着微蓝血管的眼皮低低地垂着。她微微地把头抬高，但脸上呈现出痛苦的神情。站在花园尽头的年轻人转过身，抬头看着小道。或许他透过窗户看到她们了。马狄尔达缩到了阴影里。","They were still watching the young soldier.He stood away at the bottom of the garden, with his back to them, his hands in his pockets, looking into the water of the willow pond.Matilda’s dark-blue eyes had a strange, full look in them, the lids, with the faint blue veins showing, dropped rather low.She carried her head light and high, but she had a look of pain.The young man at the bottom of the garden turned and looked up the path.Perhaps he saw them through the window.Matilda moved into shadow."
"那天下午，她们的父亲似乎病得很重，虚弱不堪。他很容易就精疲力尽。医生来了，告诉马狄尔达病人可能随时会突然离世——不过现在可能还不会。她们必须要有所准备。","That afternoon their father seemed weak and ill.He was easily exhausted.The doctor came, and told Matilda that the sick man might die suddenly at any moment—but then he might not.They must be prepared."
"那一天过去了，新的一天又开始了。哈德里安无拘无束，悠闲自在。早晨他四处闲逛，穿着褐色毛衫和卡其布裤子；毛衫没有领子，他光光的脖子露在外面。他仔细查看陶屋的房前屋后，好像这么做有着什么不能告人的目的似的。当罗克利先生稍有力气，他就和这位病人聊聊天。两个姑娘每次看到这两个男人像老朋友一样坐着聊天就很来气。不过，他们谈的大都是一些政治话题。","So the day passed, and the next.Hadrian made himself at home.He went about in the morning in his brownish jersey and his khaki trousers, collarless, his bare neck showing.He explored the pottery premises, as if he had some secret purpose in so doing, he talked with Mr. Rockley, when the sick man had strength.The two girls were always angry when the two men sat talking together like cronies.Yet it was chiefly a kind of politics they talked."
"哈德里安回来的第二天晚上，马狄尔达和父亲坐在一起。她正在临摹一幅画。屋子里很安静，哈德里安不知去了哪里，而埃米正忙着。罗克利先生斜靠在床上，默默地看着外面夕阳下的花园。","On the second day after Hadrian’s arrival, Matilda sat with her father in the evening.She was drawing a picture which she wanted to copy.It was very still, Hadrian was gone out somewhere, no one knew where, and Emmie was busy.Mr. Rockley reclined on his bed, looking out in silence over his evening-sunny garden."
"“要是我出了什么事，马狄尔达，”他说，“你不要卖了这房子——你要留在这儿——”","‘If anything happens to me, Matilda,’ he said, ‘you won’t sell this house—you’ll stop here—’"
"马狄尔达盯着父亲，眼里露出一丝憔悴的神色。","Matilda’s eyes took their slightly haggard look as she stared at her father."
"“嗯，我们也做不了别的。”她说。","‘Well, we couldn’t do anything else,’ she said."
"“你不知道你可能会做什么。”他说，“所有的东西都平分给你和埃米。你们想做什么就做什么——只是不要卖掉这房子，不要变卖了它。”","‘You don’t know what you might do,’ he said.‘Everything is left to you and Emmie, equally.You’do as you like with it—only don’t sell this house, don’t part with it.’"
"“不会的。”她说。","‘No,’ she said."
"“把我的手表和表链给哈德里安，再从银行里取出100英镑给他——如果他需要帮助，就帮帮他。我在遗嘱里没写他的名字。”","‘And give Hadrian my watch and chain, and a hundred pounds out of what’s in the bank—and help him if he ever wants helping.I haven’t put his name in the will.’"
"“您的手表和表链，还有100英镑——好的。但他回加拿大之前您不会有事的，父亲。”","‘Your watch and chain, and a hundred pounds—yes.But you’ll be here when he goes back to Canada, father.’"
"“谁也不知道会发生什么。”父亲说道。","‘You never know what’ll happen,’ said her father."
"马狄尔达坐在那里，睁着大大的、憔悴的眼睛长时间地望着父亲，似乎出了神。她明白他已意识到自己快走了——她像长着透视眼一样看到了这一点。","Matilda sat and watched him, with her full, haggard eyes, for a long time, as if tranced.She saw that he knew he must go soon—she saw like a clairvoyant."
"后来，她告诉了埃米父亲说的关于手表、表链以及钱的事情。","Later on she told Emmie what her father had said about the watch and chain and the money."
"“他有什么权利”——他——是指哈德里安——“拥有我父亲的手表和表链——这跟他有什么关系？让他拿了钱离开这儿。”埃米说道。她爱她的父亲。","‘What right has he’—he—meaning Hadrian—’to my father’s watch and chain—what has it to do with him?Let him have the money, and get off,’ said Emmie.She loved her father."
"那天晚上，马狄尔达在她房间里坐到很晚。她觉得心碎而焦虑，神志似乎有些恍惚。她的神志恍惚得厉害，甚至要哭出来了。她一直想着父亲，心里只有父亲。最后，她觉得她必须去找他。","That night Matilda sat late in her room.Her heart was anxious and breaking, her mind seemed entranced.She was too much entranced even to weep, and all the time she thought of her father, only her father.At last she felt she must go to him."
"那时已近午夜。她沿着走廊走向父亲的房间。外面的月亮投进一缕微弱的月光。她在他房间门口听了听。然后，她轻轻地打开门，走了进去。房间里微微有些黑。她听见床上有点动静。","It was near midnight.She went along the passage and to his room.There was a faint light from the moon outside.She listened at his door.Then she softly opened and entered.The room was faintly dark.She heard a movement on the bed."
"“您睡了吗？”她轻轻地问，走向床边。","‘Are you asleep?’ she said softly, advancing to the side of the bed."
"“您睡了吗？”她站到床边，轻声地重复着。随后，她在黑暗中伸手去摸他的额头。她的手指轻轻地碰到了他的鼻子和眉毛。她把自己纤细精巧的手放在了他的额头上。额头摸起来似乎柔嫩而光滑——非常柔嫩、光滑。恍惚中，某种惊诧触动了她。但这并没有使她回过神来。她轻轻地俯下身，手指触碰到他贴着额头的毛发。","‘Are you asleep?’ she repeated gently, as she stood at the side of the bed.And she reached her hand in the darkness to touch his forehead.Delicately, her fingers met the nose and the eyebrows, she laid her fine, delicate hand on his brow.It seemed fresh and smooth—very fresh and smooth.A sort of surprise stirred her, in her entranced state.But it could not waken her.Gently, she leaned over the bed and stirred her fingers over the low-growing hair on his brow."
"“您今晚睡不着吗？”她说。","‘Can’t you sleep tonight?’ she said."
"床上一阵快速的骚动。“不，我能。”一个声音答道。这是哈德里安的声音。她赶紧回避开。她立刻从深夜的恍惚中回过神来。她想起来父亲住在楼下了，而哈德里安则住在父亲的房间。她好像被蛰了一样站立在黑暗中。","There was a quick stirring in the bed.‘Yes, I can,’ a voice answered.It was Hadrian’s voice.She started away.Instantly, she was wakened from her late-at-night trance.She remembered that her father was downstairs, that Hadrian had his room.She stood in the darkness as if stung."
"“是你，哈德里安？”她说，“我还以为是我父亲呢。”她大惊失色，动弹不得。年轻人发出一声让人不安的笑声，在床上翻了个身。","‘It is you, Hadrian?’ she said.‘I thought it was my father.’She was so startled, so shocked, that she could not move.The young man gave an uncomfortable laugh, and turned in his bed."
"终于，她走出了房间。她回到自己房间，把门关上。她站在灯光下，抬起刚触碰过他的那只手，仿佛它受伤了一样。她太震惊了，简直受不了了。","At last she got out of the room.When she was back in her own room, in the light, and her door was closed, she stood holding up her hand that had touched him, as if it were hurt.She was almost too shocked, she could not endure."
"“好吧，”她那颗冷静而疲惫的心念道，“这不过是个误会，何必太在意。”","‘Well,’ said her calm and weary mind, ‘it was only a mistake, why take any notice of it.’"
"但她不能这么简单地解释自己的感觉。她很痛苦，觉得自己陷入了虚幻之中。她的右手曾经那么温柔地放在他的脸上，抚摸他柔嫩的肌肤。现在这只手却开始疼痛，似乎真的受了伤一样。发生这样的误会，她不能原谅哈德里安：这使她深深地厌恶他。","But she could not reason her feelings so easily.She suffered, feeling herself in a false position.Her right hand, which she had laid so gently on his face, on his fresh skin, ached now, as if it were really injured.She could not forgive Hadrian for the mistake: it made her dislike him deeply."
"哈德里安也没有睡好。他被开门声吵醒，还没有意识到那问话是什么意思。但她柔软的手在他脸上温柔地游走，唤醒了他灵魂深处的某种东西。他是在福利院长大的男孩，孤僻冷漠，几乎走投无路。她的爱抚轻柔、细腻，惊醒了他，向他泄露了一些未知之事。","Hadrian too slept badly.He had been awakened by the opening of the door, and had not realized what the question meant.But the soft, straying tenderness of her hand on his face startled something out of his soul.He was a charity boy, aloof and more or less at bay.The fragile exquisiteness of her caress startled him most, revealed unknown things to him."
"早晨下楼时，她从他的眼中能够感受到这种异样。她努力表现得好像什么都没发生过一样，她确实做到了。她曾忍受过太多的煎熬河痛苦，她已经具备了冷静的自我控制力，对自己也毫不在意了。她用深蓝色的、几乎令人沉醉的双眸看着他，遇到了他眼中带有某种意味的火花，却生生将它浇灭了。她用那纤细、修长的手给他的咖啡里加了糖。","In the morning she could feel the consciousness in his eyes, when she came downstairs.She tried to bear herself as if nothing at all had happened, and she succeeded.She had the calm self-control, self-indifference, of one who has suffered and borne her suffering.She looked at him from her darkish, almost drugged blue eyes, she met the spark of consciousness in his eyes, and quenched it.And with her long, fine hand she put the sugar in his coffee."
"她本以为自己可以掌控他，但实际上她做不到。鲜活的记忆刺痛了他的心灵，一种新的情感在他的意识中蠢蠢欲动。某种新的东西在他体内被惊醒。在他讳莫如深、谨慎提防的心思背后，他却将这个秘密保守得鲜活而生动。她处于他的掌控之中，因为他无所顾忌。他的处事标准与她的完全不同。","But she could not control him as she thought she could.He had a keen memory stinging his mind, a new set of sensations working in his consciousness.Something new was alert in him.At the back of his reticent, guarded mind he kept his secret alive and vivid.She was at his mercy, for he was unscrupulous, his standard was not her standard."
"他充满好奇地看着她。她并不美，鼻子太大，下巴太尖，脖子太细。但是她皮肤透亮细腻，浑身散发着高贵而敏感的气质。这种古怪、勇敢而高贵的气质遗传自她的父亲。她的手指上戴着戒指，白皙而纤细。这个来自福利院的男孩从她的手指上就能看出这种气质。他从那位老人身上感受到的魅力现在同样出现在了这个女人身上。而他自己想占有这种魅力，想掌控这种魅力。他在这个破旧的制陶场院里走来走去，脑子里秘密地策划着、思考着。他要拥有那种奇妙柔软的美妙感觉，如同她的手触摸他的脸的感觉——这就是他定下的目标。他暗暗地策划着。","He looked at her curiously.She was not beautiful, her nose was too large, her chin was too small, her neck was too thin.But her skin was clear and fine, she had a high-bred sensitiveness.This queer, brave, high-bred quality she shared with her father.The charity boy could see it in her tapering fingers, which were white and ringed.The same glamour that he knew in the elderly man he now saw in the woman.And he wanted to possess himself of it, he wanted to make himself master of it.As he went about through the old pottery-yard, his secretive mind schemed and worked.To be master of that strange soft delicacy such as he had felt in her hand upon his face,—this was what he set himself towards.He was secretly plotting."
"他看着马狄尔达走来走去，而她也意识到了他注视的目光如影随形。但她的骄傲使她对其视而不见。当他手插着口袋，晃到她跟前时，她像往常一样友善地对待他，而这比任何轻视的举止都更能掌控他。她良好的教养似乎控制住了他。她让自己对他的感觉一如从前，即他是个和他们同住在一幢房子里的年轻男孩，却是个陌生人。只是，她不敢回想她的手曾触摸过他的脸。一想起那事，她就茫然不知所措。那只手使她很生气，她真想把它砍下来。她还强烈地想要删掉他脑中的记忆。她假设自己已经这么做了。","He watched Matilda as she went about, and she became aware of his attention, as of some shadow following her.But her pride made her ignore it.When he sauntered near her, his hands in his pockets, she received him with that same commonplace kindliness which mastered him more than any contempt.Her superior breeding seemed to control him.She made herself feel towards him exactly as she had always felt: he was a young boy who lived in the house with them, but was a stranger.Only, she dared not remember his face under her hand.When she remembered that, she was bewildered.Her hand had offended her, she wanted to cut it off.And she wanted, fiercely, to cut off the memory in him.She assumed she had done so."
"有一天，当他坐着和他“叔叔”聊天时，他直视着这位病人的双眼，说道：","One day, when he sat talking with his ‘uncle’, he looked straight into the eyes of the sick man, and said:"
"“可是我不想一辈子住在罗斯利，最终死在这儿。”","‘But I shouldn’t like to live and die here in Rawsley.’"
"“不——嗯——你不用。”病人说。","‘No—well—you needn’t,’ said the sick man."
"“那您认为马狄尔达表姐喜欢这样吗？”","‘Do you think Cousin Matilda likes it?’"
"“我想应该是吧。”","‘I should think so.’"
"“我认为这不能称之为生活。”年轻人说道，“她比我大多少，叔叔？”","‘I don’t call it much of a life,’ said the youth.‘How much older is she than me, Uncle?’"
"病人看着这个年轻的士兵。","The sick man looked at the young soldier."
"“大不少。”他说。","‘A good bit,’ he said."
"“30多了？”哈德里安问。","‘Over thirty?’ said Hadrian."
"“嗯，没有多很多。她32岁。”","‘Well, not so much.She’s thirty-two.’"
"哈德里安想了一会儿。","Hadrian considered a while."
"“她看起来不像。”他说。","‘She doesn’t look it,’ he said."
"这位病中的父亲再一次看着他。","Again the sick father looked at him."
"“您觉得她想要离开这儿吗？”哈德里安说。","‘Do you think she’d like to leave here?’ said Hadrian."
"“不，我不知道。”父亲焦躁地回答。","‘Nay, I don’t know,’ replied the father, restive."
"哈德里安静静地坐着，想着自己的心事。然后，他像是发自肺腑地，以一种细微、平静的语调说道：","Hadrian sat still, having his own thoughts.Then in a small, quiet voice, as if he were speaking from inside himself, he said:"
"“如果您同意，我要娶她。”","‘I’d marry her if you wanted me to.’"
"病人突然抬起眼睛，紧紧盯着他。他盯了很长时间。年轻人望向窗外，一副神秘莫测的神情。","The sick man raised his eyes suddenly, and stared.He stared for a long time.The youth looked inscrutably out of the window."
"“你！”病人嘲弄地说，带着些许鄙夷的语气。哈德里安转身直视他的双眼。两个男人彼此心领神会。","‘You!’ said the sick man, mocking, with some contempt.Hadrian turned and met his eyes.The two men had an inexplicable understanding."
"“如果您不反对的话。”哈德里安说。","‘If you wasn’t against it,’ said Hadrian."
"“不，”父亲把脸转向一边，说道，“我想我不反对。我从来没想过这事。但是——但是埃米是最小的。”","‘Nay,’ said the father, turning aside, ‘I don’t think I’m against it.I’ve never thought of it.But—But Emmie’s the youngest.’"
"他兴奋得脸通红，看上去突然间更有了生气。他心里一直暗暗地喜欢这个男孩。","He had flushed, and looked suddenly more alive.Secretly he loved the boy."
"“您可以问问她。”哈德里安说。","‘You might ask her,’ said Hadrian."
"老人考虑了一下。","The elder man considered."
"“你自己问她不是更好吗？”他说。","‘Hadn’t you better ask her yourself?’ he said."
"“她更听您的意见。”哈德里安说道。","‘She’d take more notice of you,’ said Hadrian."
"他们都不说话了。然后，埃米走了进来。","They were both silent.Then Emmie came in."
"一连两天，罗克利先生都兴奋不已，若有所思。哈德里安安静地四处走动，不动声色，也不问什么。女儿和父亲独处的时刻终于到了。那是一个大清早，父亲疼得厉害。当疼痛稍稍减轻一些，他便静静地躺着思考。","For two days Mr. Rockley was excited and thoughtful.Hadrian went about quietly, secretly, unquestioning.At last the father and daughter were alone together.It was very early morning, the father had been in much pain.As the pain abated, he lay still, thinking."
"“马狄尔达！”他突然看着女儿叫道。","‘Matilda!’ he said suddenly, looking at his daughter."
"“是，我在这儿。”她答道。","‘Yes, I’m here,’ she said."
"“啊！我想要你做件事——”","‘Ay! I want you to do something—’"
"她期待地站起来。","She rose in anticipation."
"“不，坐着别动。我想要你嫁给哈德里安——”","‘Nay, sit still.I want you to marry Hadrian—’"
"她以为他在说胡话。她站起来，吓得惊慌失措。","She thought he was raving.She rose, bewildered and frightened."
"“不，坐着别动，坐着别动。听我跟你说。”","‘Nay, sit you still, sit you still.You hear what I tell you.’"
"“但您不知道您在说什么，爸爸。”","‘But you don’t know what you’re saying, father.’"
"“啊，我清楚得很。我说，我想要你嫁给哈德里安。”","‘Ay, I know well enough.I want you to marry Hadrian, I tell you.’"
"她惊呆了。他是个沉默寡言的人。","She was dumbfounded.He was a man of few words."
"“你要按我说的做。”他说。","‘You’ll do what I tell you,’ he said."
"她慢慢地看向他。","She looked at him slowly."
"“是什么让您有了这样的想法？”她傲慢地问道。","‘What put such an idea in your mind?’ she said proudly."
"“是他。”","‘He did.’"
"马狄尔达几乎看不起父亲了，因为她的自尊心遭到了冒犯。","Matilda almost looked her father down, her pride was so offended."
"“哼，这太丢脸了。”她说。","‘Why, it’s disgraceful,’ she said."
"“为什么？”","‘Why?’"
"她缓缓地盯着他。","She watched him slowly."
"“您为什么问我？”她说，“这太恶心了。”","‘What do you ask me for?’ she said.‘It’s disgusting.’"
"“那年轻人靠得住。”他烦躁地回答。","‘The lad’s sound enough,’ he replied, testily."
"“您最好告诉他离开这儿。”她冷冰冰地说道。","‘You’d better tell him to clear out,’ she said, coldly."
"他转过身望向窗外。她满脸通红，笔直地坐着，坐了很久。终于，父亲转向她，一副面目狰狞的样子。","He turned and looked out of the window.She sat flushed and erect for a long time.At length her father turned to her, looking really malevolent."
"“如果你不这么做，”他说，“你就是个傻子，而我会让你为你的愚蠢付出代价，知道吗？”","‘If you won’t,’ he said, ‘you’re a fool, and I’ll make you pay for your foolishness, do you see?’"
"她突然感到一阵恐惧，浑身发冷。她无法相信自己的知觉。她惊恐万分、茫然失措。她死死地盯着父亲，认为他不是精神错乱，就是疯了或是喝醉了。她该怎么办呢？","Suddenly a cold fear gripped her.She could not believe her senses.She was terrified and bewildered.She stared at her father, believing him to be delirious, or mad, or drunk.What could she do?"
"“我告诉你，”他说,“你要是不愿意，我明天就派人把惠特尔叫来。你和埃米谁都别想得到我的任何东西。”","‘I tell you,’ he said.‘I’ll send for Whittle tomorrow if you don’t.You shall neither of you have anything of mine.’"
"惠特尔是律师。她很了解自己的父亲：他会派人请来他的律师，立个遗嘱把他所有的财产都留给哈德里安；她和埃米什么都得不到。这太过分了。她站起来，走出房间，上楼回到自己房里，把自己反锁在里面。","Whittle was the solicitor.She understood her father well enough: he would send for his solicitor, and make a will leaving all his property to Hadrian: neither she nor Emmie should have anything.It was too much.She rose and went out of the room, up to her own room, where she locked herself in."
"她在里面呆了好几个小时。最后，到了深夜，她向埃米透漏了这个秘密。","She did not come out for some hours.At last, late at night, she confided in Emmie."
"“狡猾的恶魔，他要的是钱。”埃米说道，“父亲一定是昏了头了。”","‘The sliving demon, he wants the money,’ said Emmie.‘My father’s out of his mind.’"
"哈德里安只是想要钱，这个想法对马狄尔达来说又是一个打击。她不爱那个让她难以接受的年轻人——但也从来没把他当成是什么恶人。现在他在她脑中变得面目可憎。","The thought that Hadrian merely wanted the money was another blow to Matilda.She did not love the impossible youth—but she had not yet learned to think of him as a thing of evil.He now became hideous to her mind."
"第二天，埃米和父亲发生了一些争执。","Emmie had a little scene with her father next day."
"“您昨天对我们的马狄尔达说的不是真的吧，爸爸？”她咄咄逼人地问。","‘You don’t mean what you said to our Matilda yesterday, do you, father?’ she asked aggressively."
"“是真的。”他回答。","‘Yes,’ he replied."
"“什么？那您要改遗嘱？”","‘What, that you’ll alter your will?’"
"“是的。”","‘Yes.’"
"“您不能这样。”女儿愤怒地说。","‘You won’t,’ said his angry daughter."
"但是他看着她，不怀好意地笑了笑。","But he looked at her with a malevolent little smile."
"“安妮！""他大声喊,“安妮！”","‘Annie!’ he shouted.‘Annie!’"
"他仍然有力气喊话。女仆从厨房里走了进来。","He had still power to make his voice carry.The servant maid came in from the kitchen."
"“换上衣服，去趟惠特尔的办公室，说我要尽快见到他，并让他带上一张遗嘱表。”","‘Put your things on, and go down to Whittle’s office, and say I want to see Mr. Whittle as soon as he can, and will he bring a will-form.’"
"病人稍稍往后靠了靠——他不能躺下。他的女儿像被打了一样呆坐着。然后，她离开了房间。","The sick man lay back a little—he could not lie down.His daughter sat as if she had been struck.Then she left the room."
"哈德里安正在花园里闲逛。她径直走向他。","Hadrian was pottering about in the garden.She went straight down to him."
"“喂，”她说，“你最好快滚。你最好带上你的东西离开这里，快点。”","‘Here,’ she said.‘You’d better get off.You’d better take your things and go from here, quick.’"
"哈德里安不为所动地看着这个怒气冲冲的姑娘。","Hadrian looked slowly at the infuriated girl."
"“谁说的？”他问。","‘Who says so?’ he asked."
"“我们说的——快滚，你造成的伤害够多了。”","‘We say so—get off, you’ve done enough mischief and damage.’"
"“是叔叔这样说的吗？”","‘Does Uncle say so?’"
"“是的，他说的。”","‘Yes, he does.’"
"“我去问他。”","‘I’ll go and ask him.’"
"但是埃米像个泼妇一样挡住了他。","But like a fury Emmie barred his way."
"“不，不必了。你根本没必要去问他。我们不想你留下，所以你可以走了。”","‘No, you needn’t.You needn’t ask him nothing at all.We don’t want you, so you can go.’"
"“叔叔才是这家的主人。”","‘Uncle’s boss here.’"
"“对一个将死的人，你不停地巴结他，算计他的钱！你真不配活着。”","‘A man that’s dying, and you crawling round and working on him for his money!—you’re not fit to live.’"
"“哦！”他说，“谁说我算计他的钱？”","‘Oh!’ he said.‘Who says I’m working for his money?’"
"“我说的。但是我父亲已经跟马狄尔达说了，她也知道你是什么样的人了。她知道你要的是什么。所以你最好赶快离开，因为你最后的下场就是——穷鬼一个！”","‘I say.But my father told our Matilda, and she knows what you are.She knows what you’re after.So you might as well clear out, for all you’ll get—guttersnipe!’"
"他背对着她，思考着。他从来没想过他们会认为他是为了要钱。他确实想要钱——非常想。他非常想自己当老板，而不是个雇工。虽然他一贯精打细算、深谋远虑，但他知道他并不是为了钱才想娶马狄尔达的。他既想要钱，也想要马狄尔达。但是他告诉自己这两个愿望是互不相干的，并不是一回事。没有钱他没法得到马狄尔达。但他并不是为了钱而想要她。","He turned his back on her, to think.It had not occurred to him that they would think he was after the money.He did want the money—badly.He badly wanted to be an employer himself, not one of the employed.But he knew, in his subtle, calculating way, that it was not for money he wanted Matilda.He wanted both the money and Matilda.But he told himself the two desires were separate, not one.He could not do with Matilda, without the money.But he did not want her for the money."
"想清楚了这一点之后，他开始暗暗地关注着她，想寻找机会告诉她。但是她躲着他。傍晚，律师来了。罗克利先生似乎有了新的力量源泉——他拟定了一份遗嘱，把以前的安排统统加上了附加条件。如果马狄尔达同意嫁给哈德里安，那么以前的遗嘱仍然有效。如果她拒绝，那么六个月后，所有的财产将由哈德里安继承。","When he got this clear in his mind, he sought for an opportunity to tell it her, lurking and watching.But she avoided him.In the evening the lawyer came.Mr. Rockley seemed to have a new access of strength—a will was drawn up, making the previous arrangements wholly conditional.The old will held good, if Matilda would consent to marry Hadrian.If she refused then at the end of six months the whole property passed to Hadrian."
"带着一种不怀好意的满足感，罗克利先生把这事告诉了年轻人。他似乎有一种奇怪的、极其荒唐的欲望，想要报复这些长期以来围在他身边、细心照顾他的女人们。","Mr. Rockley told this to the young man, with malevolent satisfaction.He seemed to have a strange desire, quite unreasonable, for revenge upon the women who had surrounded him for so long, and served him so carefully."
"“当着我的面告诉她。”哈德里安说。","‘Tell her in front of me,’ said Hadrian."
"于是罗克利先生派人叫来两个女儿。","So Mr. Rockley sent for his daughters."
"她们终于来了，面色惨白、缄默不语，一副倔强固执的姿态。马狄尔达似乎已经大大退缩了，而埃米则像个斗士一样准备斗争到底。病人斜靠在床上，眼睛明亮，肿胀的手颤抖着。但他的脸上再现出旧时的光彩与英俊。哈德里安静静地坐在一边。这个在福利院长大的、不安分的男孩，一副不屈不挠的样子。","At last they came, pale, mute, stubborn.Matilda seemed to have retired far off, Emmie seemed like a fighter ready to fight to the death.The sick man reclined on the bed, his eyes bright, his puffed hand trembling.But his face had again some of its old, bright handsomeness.Hadrian sat quiet, a little aside: the indomitable, dangerous charity boy."
"“遗嘱在那儿。”父亲说着，给她们指了指那张纸。","‘There’s the will,’ said their father, pointing them to the paper."
"两个女人沉默地坐着，一动不动，没有理会。","The two women sat mute and immovable, they took no notice."
"“或者你嫁给哈德里安，或者他拥有一切。”父亲心满意足地说。","‘Either you marry Hadrian, or he has everything,’ said the father with satisfaction."
"“那就让他拥有一切吧。”马狄尔达大胆地说。","‘Then let him have everything,’ said Matilda boldly."
"“他不能！他不能！”埃米大声叫道，“他不能拥有一切。这个穷鬼！”","‘He’s not!He’s not!’ cried Emmie fiercely.‘He’s not going to have it.The guttersnipe!’"
"父亲脸上浮现出顽皮的神情。","An amused look came on her father’s face."
"“你听到了，哈德里安。”他说。","‘You hear that, Hadrian,’ he said."
"“我不是为了钱才请求马狄尔达表姐嫁给我的。”哈德里安满脸通红地说道，身子在凳子上扭来扭去。","‘I didn’t offer to marry Cousin Matilda for the money,’ said Hadrian, flushing and moving on his seat."
"马狄尔达淡漠地看着他，深蓝色的眼睛令人沉醉。在她看来，他像一个陌生的小怪物。","Matilda looked at him slowly, with her dark-blue, drugged eyes.He seemed a strange little monster to her."
"“哼，你这个骗子，你知道你做了什么。”埃米大叫。","‘Why, you liar, you know you did,’ cried Emmie."
"病人笑了。马狄尔达继续以一种怪异的眼神注视着这个年轻人。","The sick man laughed.Matilda continued to gaze strangely at the young man."
"“她知道我不是。”哈德里安说。","‘She knows I didn’t,’ said Hadrian."
"他也有他的勇气，如同一只耗子最终会有百折不挠的勇气一样。哈德里安具有耗子一样缜密、拘谨、诡秘的性格。但或许他还拥有一种无法超越的胆量，是所有勇气中最不可战胜的。","He too had his courage, as a rat has indomitable courage in the end.Hadrian had some of the neatness, the reserve, the underground quality of the rat.But he had perhaps the ultimate courage, the most unquenchable courage of all."
"埃米看着她的姐姐。","Emmie looked at her sister."
"“噢，好吧。”她说，“马狄尔达——别烦了。让他拥有一切吧，我们能照顾好自己。”","‘Oh, well,’ she said.‘Matilda—don’t bother.Let him have everything, we can look after ourselves.’"
"“我知道他会拿走一切。”马狄尔达漫不经心地说。","‘I know he’ll take everything,’ said Matilda, abstractedly."
"哈德里安没有回答。事实上，他知道如果马狄尔达拒绝他，他会带着所有的一切离开这儿。","Hadrian did not answer.He knew in fact that if Matilda refused him he would take everything, and go off with it."
"“狡猾的小男人！”埃米边说边做了个嘲弄的鬼脸。","‘A clever little mannie—!’ said Emmie, with a jeering grimace."
"父亲无声地、自顾自地笑了。但他累了......","The father laughed noiselessly to himself.But he was tired...."
"“那么，走吧。”他说，“走吧，让我安静会儿。”","‘Go on, then,’ he said.‘Go on, let me be quiet.’"
"埃米转身看着他。","Emmie turned and looked at him."
"“你有什么样的下场都是自找的。”她直截了当地对父亲说道。","‘You deserve what you’ve got,’ she said to her father bluntly."
"“走吧，”他温和地回答，“走吧。”","‘Go on,’ he answered mildly.‘Go on.’"
"又一个晚上过去了——一个值夜班的看护整夜守着罗克利先生。新的一天到来了。哈德里安还像往常一样呆着，身上穿着羊毛衫和粗糙的卡其色裤子，脖子还是露在外面。身体虚弱、精神恍惚的马狄尔达四处闲逛，而皮肤白皙的埃米则满脸怒容。她们都很安静，因为不想让被蒙在鼓里的仆人知道任何事。","Another night passed—a night nurse sat up with Mr. Rockley.Another day came.Hadrian was there as ever, in his woollen jersey and coarse khaki trousers and bare neck.Matilda went about, frail and distant, Emmie black-browed in spite of her blondness.They were all quiet, for they did not intend the mystified servant to learn anything."
"罗克利先生的剧痛又发作了几次，几乎不能呼吸。生命似乎到了尽头。所有人都安静而坚忍，但谁都不屈服。哈德里安在心里琢磨着。如果他不娶马狄尔达，他就带着两万英镑去加拿大。这本身就是个非常美好的前景。如果马狄尔达同意嫁给他，他就什么都得不到——而她会得到属于她自己的钱。","Mr. Rockley had very bad attacks of pain, he could not breathe.The end seemed near.They all went about quiet and stoical, all unyielding.Hadrian pondered within himself.If he did not marry Matilda he would go to Canada with twenty thousand pounds.This was itself a very satisfactory prospect.If Matilda consented he would have nothing—she would have her own money."
"埃米开始采取行动。她出去找到律师，把他带回了家。双方进行了一次会谈，惠特尔试图吓退这年轻人——但徒劳无功。牧师和亲戚们也被叫来了——但是哈德里安一动不动地看着他们，完全不予理会。不过，这些使他很生气。","Emmie was the one to act.She went off in search of the solicitor and brought him with her.There was an interview, and Whittle tried to frighten the youth into withdrawal—but without avail.The clergyman and relatives were summoned—but Hadrian stared at them and took no notice.It made him angry, however."
"他想单独和马狄尔达碰面。很多天过去了，他都没能成功：她躲着他。终于有一天，他偷偷地在她去摘醋栗时切断了她的退路，让她吃了一惊。他马上切入正题。","He wanted to catch Matilda alone.Many days went by, and he was not successful: she avoided him.At last, lurking, he surprised her one day as she came to pick gooseberries, and he cut off her retreat.He came to the point at once."
"“那么，你是不想要我吗？”他用他难以捉摸、讨好谄媚的嗓音问道。","‘You don’t want me, then?’ he said, in his subtle, insinuating voice."
"“我不想和你说话。”她背过脸说。","‘I don’t want to speak to you,’ she said, averting her face."
"“但你把手放在我脸上，”他说，“你不应该那么做，否则我就永远都不会想这事了。你不该摸我。”","‘You put your hand on me, though,’ he said.‘You shouldn’t have done that, and then I should never have thought of it.You shouldn’t have touched me.’"
"“你要是个体面的人，你就该知道那是场误会，然后忘了它。”她说。","‘If you were anything decent, you’d know that was a mistake, and forget it,’ she said."
"“我知道那是场误会——但我忘不了。如果你将一个男人唤醒了，那他就无法再沉睡下去，因为他被点醒了。 ”","‘I know it was a mistake—but I shan’t forget it.If you wake a man up, he can’t go to sleep again because he’s told to.’"
"“如果你还算有些正派的话，你应该已经离开了。”她答道。","‘If you had any decent feeling in you, you’d have gone away,’ she replied."
"“我不想走。”他回答。","‘I didn’t want to,’ he replied."
"她转过脸去，望向远方。终于，她问道：","She looked away into the distance.At last she asked:"
"“要不是为了钱，你又为何纠缠我？我年纪大得可以当你的母亲了。在某种程度上，我曾经就是你的母亲。”","‘What do you persecute me for, if it isn’t for the money.I’m old enough to be your mother.In a way I’ve been your mother.’"
"“没关系，”他说，“对我来说，你绝不是母亲。你嫁给我吧，然后我们一起去加拿大——你满可以这样做——你摸过我。”","‘Doesn’t matter,’ he said.‘You’ve been no mother to me.Let us marry and go out to Canada—you might as well—you’ve touched me.’"
"她脸色苍白，浑身发抖。突然间，她气得面红耳赤。","She was white and trembling.Suddenly she flushed with anger."
"“真不要脸。”她说。","‘It’s so indecent,’ she said."
"“怎么？”他反驳道，“是你摸了我。”","‘How?’ he retorted.‘You touched me.’"
"但她从他身边走开了。她觉得自己好像已经进入了他的圈套。他又生气又郁闷，觉得再次受到了鄙视。","But she walked away from him.She felt as if he had trapped her.He was angry and depressed, he felt again despised."
"就在那天晚上，她走进父亲的房间。","That same evening she went into her father’s room."
"“好，”她突然说道，“我嫁给他。”","‘Yes,’ she said suddenly.‘I’ll marry him.’"
"父亲抬起头看她。他正疼得厉害，已然病入膏肓。","Her father looked up at her.He was in pain, and very ill."
"“现在你喜欢他了，是吗？”他问道，嘴角浮现一丝微笑。","‘You like him now, do you?’ he said, with a faint smile."
"她俯视着他的脸，知道死亡已经不远了。她转过身，冷漠地走出了房间。","She looked down into his face, and saw death not far off.She turned and went coldly out of the room."
"律师被请了来，筹备工作仓促展开。在筹备工作的间隙，马狄尔达从不跟哈德里安说话；他问她话，她也从不回答。清晨，他靠近她。","The solicitor was sent for, preparations were hastily made.In all the interval Matilda did not speak to Hadrian, never answered him if he addressed her.He approached her in the morning."
"“那么，你改变主意了？”他说道，一副愉悦的表情，眼睛闪闪发亮，流露出几乎可算是和善的目光。她居高临下看着他，然后转过脸去。她既是居高临下看着他，也是看不起他。然而他坚持，并最终取得了胜利。","‘You’ve come round to it, then?’ he said, giving her a pleasant look from his twinkling, almost kindly eyes.She looked down at him and turned aside.She looked down on him both literally and figuratively.Still he persisted, and triumphed."
"埃米破口大骂、痛哭流涕，消息不胫而走。但是马狄尔达沉默寡言、无动于衷；而哈德里安则很平静，心满意足的样子，还掺杂着忧虑。但他不屈服于自己的忧虑。罗克利先生已经病入膏肓，无法挽救了。","Emmie raved and wept, the secret flew abroad.But Matilda was silent and unmoved, Hadrian was quiet and satisfied, and nipped with fear also.But he held out against his fear.Mr. Rockley was very ill, but unchanged."
"第三天，婚礼举行了。马狄尔达和哈德里安从登记处立即驱车回家，径直走进垂死者的房间。他瞬间露出一丝安详的微笑，眼睛发亮。","On the third day the marriage took place.Matilda and Hadrian drove straight home from the registrar, and went straight into the room of the dying man.His face lit up with a clear twinkling smile."
"“哈德里安——你得到她了？”他的嗓音有些嘶哑。","‘Hadrian—you’ve got her?’ he said, a little hoarsely."
"“是的。”哈德里安说道，脸颊苍白。","‘Yes,’ said Hadrian, who was pale round the gills."
"“啊，年轻人，真高兴你是属于我的了。”垂死的人回答。然后他转向马狄尔达，仔细地看着她。","‘Ay, my lad, I’m glad you’re mine,’ replied the dying man.Then he turned his eyes closely on Matilda."
"“让我看看你，马狄尔达。”他说。接着，他的声音变得陌生，有些辨不出来了。“吻我。”他说道。","‘Let’s look at you, Matilda,’ he said.Then his voice went strange and unrecognizable.‘Kiss me,’ he said."
"她弯腰亲吻了他。她之前从来没有吻过他，即使她还是个小孩子的时候也没有这样做过。但她很平静，非常平静。","She stooped and kissed him.She had never kissed him before, not since she was a tiny child.But she was quiet, very still."
"“吻他。”垂死的人又说。","‘Kiss him,’ the dying man said."
"马狄尔达顺从地翘起嘴唇，亲吻了她这位年轻的丈夫。","Obediently, Matilda put forward her mouth and kissed the young husband."
"“这就对了！这就对了！”垂死的人喃喃地说道。","‘That’s right!That’s right!’ murmured the dying man."
