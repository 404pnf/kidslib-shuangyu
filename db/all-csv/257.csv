"春天的阴影","The Shades of Spring"
"第一章","CHAPTER I"
"穿过这片森林可以少走一英里的路程。辛森在经过铁匠铺时机械地拐了过去，拨开了田间栅门。铁匠和他的伙计静止地站在那儿，看着这个不速之客。但是辛森看起来太过绅士，这使得他们无法和他搭讪。就这样，铁匠和他的伙计沉默地看着辛森穿过这片地，进入了森林。","It was a mile nearer through the wood.Mechanically, Syson turned up by the forge and lifted the field-gate.The blacksmith and his mate stood still, watching the trespasser.But Syson looked too much a gentleman to be accosted.They let him go in silence across the small field to the wood."
"这天早晨和六年或八年前那些春天的早晨没有丝毫不同，还是那样清新明亮。白色和黄棕色的鸡依旧在栅门周围刨土，弄得遍地都是鸡毛和刨出的脏东西。矮树篱中有两簇浓密的冬青灌木，而这两簇灌木之间有一个隐蔽的缺口。人们可以翻过这个篱笆进入森林。而篱笆上的木条和之前一样被守林人踩得满是痕迹。他终于回来了。","There was not the least difference between this morning and those of the bright springs, six or eight years back.White and sandy-gold fowls still scratched round the gate, littering the earth and the field with feathers and scratched-up rubbish.Between the two thick holly bushes in the wood-hedge was the hidden gap, whose fence one climbed to get into the wood; the bars were scored just the same by the keeper’s boots.He was back in the eternal."
"辛森高兴极了。他像个不安的幽灵回到了以往生活过的村庄，他发觉这里一直在等着他，一点也没有变。榛树依旧欢快地向下伸展着它的小手。在葱郁的青草间，在灌木的树阴下，风铃草还是那样柔弱、稀疏。","Syson was extraordinarily glad.Like an uneasy spirit he had returned to the country of his past, and he found it waiting for him, unaltered.The hazel still spread glad little hands downwards, the bluebells here were still wan and few, among the lush grass and in shade of the bushes."
"就在山坡的顶部，有条小路穿过丛林，一度蜿蜒至很远。周边是枝繁叶茂的橡树，展示着它们的金贵。一丛丛的车叶草、一片片的山毛榉和一簇簇的风信子把地面装饰成了美丽的菱形拼图。两棵倒下的树依旧横躺在小路上。辛森摇摇晃晃地走下一个陡峭崎岖的山坡，再一次来到一片空地。此刻从这里往北望去，就好像透过丛林里的一扇大窗户看过去一样。他停在那儿，目光掠过山顶的平地，凝望着村庄。那村庄点缀着光秃秃的高地，就好像是从过往的工业货车上颠下来，被遗弃在这儿似的。那里有一座笔挺的、洋溢着现代风格的灰色小教堂。红色的住房纵横交错，散落其中。村庄后部，矿井的井架闪闪发亮，矿山若隐若现。户外的一切都赤裸裸的，连一棵树也没有！那里真是一点也没有变。","The path through the wood, on the very brow of a slope, ran winding easily for a time.All around were twiggy oaks, just issuing their gold, and floor spaces diapered with woodruff, with patches of dog-mercury and tufts of hyacinth.Two fallen trees still lay across the track.Syson jolted down a steep, rough slope, and came again upon the open land, this time looking north as through a great window in the wood.He stayed to gaze over the level fields of the hill-top, at the village which strewed the bare upland as if it had tumbled off the passing waggons of industry, and been forsaken.There was a stiff, modern, grey little church, and blocks and rows of red dwellings lying at random; at the back, the twinkling headstocks of the pit, and the looming pit-hill.All was naked and out-of-doors, not a tree!It was quite unaltered."
"辛森满意地转过身，沿着这条通往山下的小路向森林走去。莫名其妙地，他得意起来，感觉自己又回到了永恒的梦幻中。突然，他如梦初醒，吃了一惊。一位守林人正站在前面几码远的地方，挡住了去路。","Syson turned, satisfied, to follow the path that sheered downhill into the wood.He was curiously elated, feeling himself back in an enduring vision.He started.A keeper was standing a few yards in front, barring the way."
"“先生，您走这条路是要去哪里？”那个男人问道。语气中带着挑衅的意味。辛森用冷淡而又敏锐的目光注视着这个家伙。这是一位二十四五岁的年轻人，脸色红润，面容俊俏。一双深蓝色眼睛正盛气凌人地盯着这位入侵者。他乌黑浓密的胡须剪得很短，下面是一张小巧、极柔软的嘴。无论从哪方面来看，这小伙子都很有男人味，很帅气。他中等个头，前胸健壮突出，身体挺得笔直而又充满自信，神态悠然自得。这一切都给人一种充满野性的感觉，就像喷泉为使自己保持内在的平衡而喷射出的一股急流。他站在那儿，枪托支在地上，用不确定而审视的眼神看着辛森。这个外来者则用黑黑的、转个不停的眼睛审视着这个男人，洞察着他，完全无视他的职权。这使守林人不安起来，脸也变得通红。","“Where might you be going this road, sir?” asked the man.The tone of his question had a challenging twang.Syson looked at the fellow with an impersonal, observant gaze.It was a young man of four or five and twenty, ruddy and well favoured.His dark blue eyes now stared aggressively at the intruder.His black moustache, very thick, was cropped short over a small, rather soft mouth.In every other respect the fellow was manly and good-looking.He stood just above middle height; the strong forward thrust of his chest, and the perfect ease of his erect, self-sufficient body, gave one the feeling that he was taut with animal life, like the thick jet of a fountain balanced in itself.He stood with the butt of his gun on the ground, looking uncertainly and questioningly at Syson.The dark, restless eyes of the trespasser, examining the man and penetrating into him without heeding his office, troubled the keeper and made him flush."
"“内勒在哪儿？你接了他的工作？”辛森问道。","“Where is Naylor?Have you got his job?” Syson asked."
"“你不是从豪斯来的，对吗？”守林人问道。那是不可能的，因为那里的人早就搬走了。","“You’re not from the House, are you?” inquired the keeper.It could not be, since everyone was away."
"“是的，我不是从豪斯来的。”辛森答道。好像有意戏弄他似的。","“No, I’m not from the House,” the other replied.It seemed to amuse him."
"“那么我可否问一下你要去哪儿呢？”守林人愤愤地说。","“Then might I ask where you were making for?” said the keeper, nettled."
"“我要去哪儿呢？”辛森重复道。“我要去威利－瓦特农场。”","“Where I am making for?” Syson repeated.“I am going to Willey–Water Farm.”"
"“不是这条路。”","“This isn’t the road.”"
"“我觉得是。沿着这条路一直走，路过一口井，然后从白门出去。”","“I think so.Down this path, past the well, and out by the white gate.”"
"“但那可不是公路。”","“But that’s not the public road.”"
"“我也认为那不是。我都忘了，内勒在这儿的时候，我经常走这条路。顺便问一句，内勒在哪儿？”","“I suppose not.I used to come so often, in Naylor’s time, I had forgotten.Where is he, by the way?”"
"“得了风湿病，瘸了。”守林人不情愿地回应道。","“Crippled with rheumatism,” the keeper answered reluctantly."
"“是吗？”辛森痛苦地惊呼道。","“Is he?”Syson exclaimed in pain."
"“那你是谁啊？”守林人换了一种语调问道。","“And who might you be?” asked the keeper, with a new intonation."
"“约翰·阿德利·辛森，我以前住在考迪莱恩。”","“John Adderley Syson; I used to live in Cordy Lane.”"
"“以前追求过希尔达·米勒希普？”","“Used to court Hilda Millership?”"
"辛森睁大双眼，脸上露出一丝痛苦的微笑。他点了点头。接着是一阵令人别扭的沉默。","Syson’s eyes opened with a pained smile.He nodded.There was an awkward silence."
"“那么你——你是谁啊？”辛森问道。","“And you—who are you?” asked Syson."
"“阿瑟·佩尔比姆——内勒是我的叔叔。”守林人说。","“Arthur Pilbeam—Naylor’s my uncle,” said the other."
"“你就住在纳托尔这里吗？”","“You live here in Nuttall?”"
"“我现在就住在我叔叔家——内勒家。”","“I’m lodgin’ at my uncle’s—at Naylor’s.”"
"“我明白了！”","“I see!”"
"“你说过要到威利－瓦特去？”守林人问道。","“Did you say you was goin’ down to Willey–Water?” asked the keeper."
"“是的。”","“Yes.”"
"两人停顿了片刻之后，守林人突然说：“我正在追求希尔达·米勒希普。”","There was a pause of some moments, before the keeper blurted: “I’M courtin’ Hilda Millership.”"
"这位年轻人充满敌意但又几乎是同情地看着这位不速之客。辛森眼前一亮。","The young fellow looked at the intruder with a stubborn defiance, almost pathetic.Syson opened new eyes."
"“是吗？”辛森惊讶地问。守林人变得满脸通红。","“Are you?” he said, astonished.The keeper flushed dark."
"“我和她正在交往。”他说。","“She and me are keeping company,” he said."
"“我居然不知道！”辛森说。守林人不自在地等着对方继续说下去。","“I didn’t know!” said Syson.The other man waited uncomfortably."
"“这事，定好了吗？”不速之客问道。","“What, is the thing settled?” asked the intruder."
"“怎么，定好了？”守林人愠怒地反驳道。","“How, settled?” retorted the other sulkily."
"“你们很快就要结婚了吗，有没有诸如此类的事？”","“Are you going to get married soon, and all that?”"
"守林人沉默地凝视了一段时间，一副无奈的样子。","The keeper stared in silence for some moments, impotent."
"“我想是的。”他满怀怨恨地说。","“I suppose so,” he said, full of resentment."
"“噢！”辛森仔细地注视着他说。","“Ah!” Syson watched closely."
"过了一会儿，辛森补充道：“我已经结婚了。”","“I’m married myself,” he added, after a time."
"“你结婚了？”守林人怀疑地问道。","“You are?” said the other incredulously."
"辛森响亮而又凄然地笑了笑。","Syson laughed in his brilliant, unhappy way."
"“十五个月之前。”他说。","“This last fifteen months,” he said."
"守林人睁大双眼，用疑惑的眼神瞪着他，显然在回想过去，试图把事情弄清楚。","The keeper gazed at him with wide, wondering eyes, apparently thinking back, and trying to make things out."
"“怎么，难道你不知道吗？”辛森问道。","“Why, didn’t you know?” asked Syson."
"“是的，我不知道。”守林人绷着脸说。","“No, I didn’t,” said the other sulkily."
"接下来是一阵沉默。","There was silence for a moment."
"“哦，好了！”辛森说道，“我要继续赶路了。我想我可以走吧。”对面的守林人一声不吭地站在那儿。两人在这片绿草茵茵的开阔地上迟疑不决。周围是一束束茁壮成长的风铃草，这一小片开阔地就位于山的坡顶。辛森犹豫地往前走了几步，然后又停了下来。","“Ah well!” said Syson, “I will go on. I suppose I may.”The keeper stood in silent opposition.The two men hesitated in the open, grassy space, set around with small sheaves of sturdy bluebells; a little open platform on the brow of the hill.Syson took a few indecisive steps forward, then stopped."
"“我说，这里真漂亮！”他喊道。","“I say, how beautiful!” he cried."
"整个山坡的景色他已尽收眼底。宽宽的道路像一条小河从他的脚下延伸出去。除了守林人在路中央踏出的绿色羊肠小径外，路上长满了风铃草。这条路就像一条小溪，通往水边蔚蓝的浅滩。那里生长着丛丛簇簇的风铃草。绿色的羊肠小径依然从风铃草中穿过，像一条窄窄的冰水流过蓝色的湖面。一片阴影斑驳的碧蓝徜徉在灌木的紫色枝条下，仿佛花朵越过林地，卧在水中。","He had come in full view of the downslope.The wide path ran from his feet like a river, and it was full of bluebells, save for a green winding thread down the centre, where the keeper walked.Like a stream the path opened into azure shallows at the levels, and there were pools of bluebells, with still the green thread winding through, like a thin current of ice-water through blue lakes.And from under the twig-purple of the bushes swam the shadowed blue, as if the flowers lay in flood water over the woodland."
"“哦，这里多美啊！”辛森惊呼道。这就是他的过去，他曾经抛弃的村庄。它的美刺痛了他。林鸽在头顶咕咕地叫着，空气里洋溢着鸟儿们欢快的歌唱。","“Ah, isn’t it lovely!”Syson exclaimed; this was his past, the country he had abandoned, and it hurt him to see it so beautiful.Woodpigeons cooed overhead, and the air was full of the brightness of birds singing."
"“如果你结婚了，为什么还一直给她写信，寄给她诗集还有别的东西？” 守林人问道。辛森盯着他，十分震惊并感到羞愧万分。然后他笑了笑。","“If you’re married, what do you keep writing to her for, and sending her poetry books and things?” asked the keeper.Syson stared at him, taken aback and humiliated.Then he began to smile."
"“哦，”他说，“我不知道你......”","“Well,” he said, “I did not know about you...”"
"守林人又一次满脸通红。","Again the keeper flushed darkly."
"“但是如果你结婚了——”他指责道。","“But if you are married—” he charged."
"“我是结婚了。”辛森嘲弄地说。","“I am,” answered the other cynically."
"随后，辛森俯视着这条美丽的青色小路，感到了自己的耻辱。“我又有什么权利抓住她不放？”他痛苦而又妄自菲薄地想着。","Then, looking down the blue, beautiful path, Syson felt his own humiliation.“What right HAVE I to hang on to her?” he thought, bitterly  self-contemptuous."
"“她知道我结婚了。”辛森说。","“She knows I’m married and all that,” he said."
"“可是你一直给她寄书。”守林人质疑道。","“But you keep sending her books,” challenged the keeper."
"辛森一声不吭，嘲弄而又半带怜悯地看着这个人。然后，他转过身去。","Syson, silenced, looked at the other man quizzically, half pitying.Then he turned."
"“再见。”他说道，之后便离开了。现在，一切都使他感到烦躁：两棵阔叶柳，一棵通体金黄色，散发着香气，还发出沙沙声；另一棵泛着银灰色和绿色，长满刺毛。这使他回想起在这里曾经给她讲过花朵授粉的往事。他真是个傻瓜！总是干蠢事！","“Good day,” he said, and was gone.Now, everything irritated him: the two sallows, one all gold and perfume and murmur, one silver-green and bristly, reminded him, that here he had taught her about pollination.What a fool he was!What god-forsaken folly it all was!"
"“啊，那么，”　辛森自言自语道，“这个可怜的家伙好像对我心存嫉妒。我会尽力帮他的。”他气急败坏地咧了咧嘴。","“Ah well,” he said to himself; “the poor devil seems to have a grudge against me.I’ll do my best for him.”He grinned to himself, in a very bad temper."
"第二章","CHAPTER II"
"农场离林边不到一百码远。树墙构成了这个开阔的四方形庭院的第四面墙。房屋面朝树林。怀着复杂的心情，辛森留意到李子花散落在长势茂盛、色彩缤纷的樱草花上。这些樱草花还是他亲手种在这里的。如今它们长得多茂盛啊！李子树下长着丛丛簇簇的樱草花，有大红色的、粉红色的、还有淡紫色的。辛森看见有人透过厨房的窗子扫了他一眼，还听到男人们的说话声。","The farm was less than a hundred yards from the wood’s edge.The wall of trees formed the fourth side to the open quadrangle.The house faced the wood.With tangled emotions, Syson noted the plum blossom falling on the profuse, coloured primroses, which he himself had brought here and set.How they had increased!There were thick tufts of scarlet, and pink, and pale purple primroses under the plum trees.He saw somebody glance at him through the kitchen window, heard men’s voices."
"房门突然打开了：她俨然已经出落成一个大姑娘了！他感到自己面色发白。","The door opened suddenly: very womanly she had grown!He felt himself going pale."
"“你是？——阿迪！”她惊呼道，一动不动地呆站在那儿。","“You?—Addy!” she exlaimed, and stood motionless."
"“谁啊？”农夫喊道。接着是男人们低沉的声音。那些低沉的声音，好奇而又几乎带着嘲弄，使这位访客心生痛楚。辛森在那儿等着，冲着她灿烂地微笑。","“Who?” called the farmer’s voice.Men’s low voices answered.Those low voices, curious and almost jeering, roused the tormented spirit in the visitor.Smiling brilliantly at her, he waited."
"“我——为什么不是呢？”他说道。","“Myself—why not?” he said."
"她脸红了，一直红到面颊和脖根。","The flush burned very deep on her cheek and throat."
"“我们马上就要吃完饭了。”她说。","“We are just finishing dinner,” she said."
"“那我在外面呆着。”他示意自己会坐在门旁的红色陶桶上。这桶伫立在水仙花丛中，里面还装着饮用水。","“Then I will stay outside.”He made a motion to show that he would sit on the red earthenware pipkin that stood near the door among the daffodils, and contained the drinking water."
"“哦，不要，进来吧。”她急忙说道。辛森跟着她走进去。在门口，辛森迅速地瞥了这家人一眼，并鞠躬行礼。在场的每个人都很困惑。农夫、他的妻子，还有四个儿子坐在餐桌旁。餐桌上胡乱摆放着些盘碟，男人们的衣袖一直挽到胳膊肘的地方。","“Oh no, come in,” she said hurriedly.He followed her.In the doorway, he glanced swiftly over the family, and bowed.Everyone was confused.The farmer, his wife, and the four sons sat at the coarsely laid dinner-table, the men with arms bare to the elbows."
"“非常抱歉在午餐时间来打搅你们。”辛森说道。","“I am sorry I come at lunch-time,” said Syson."
"“你好，阿迪！”农夫说道，尽管用的是以前的称呼，可是语调冷淡。“你好吗？”","“Hello, Addy!” said the farmer, assuming the old form of address, but his tone cold.“How are you?”"
"然后他和辛森握了手。","And he shook hands."
"“你要吃点吗？”他邀请这位年轻的访客，但想当然地认为他会被拒绝。他断定辛森已变得相当讲究，吃不下这粗茶淡饭。年轻人对这种责难感到畏缩。","“Shall you have a bit?” he invited the young visitor, but taking for granted the offer would be refused.He assumed that Syson was become too refined to eat so roughly.The young man winced at the imputation."
"“你吃过饭了吗？”女儿问道。　","“Have you had any dinner?” asked the daughter."
"“没有。”辛森回答道，“现在太早了。我一点半的时候就回去。”","“No,” replied Syson.“It is too early.I shall be back at half-past one.”"
"“你叫它午餐，是吗？”大儿子近乎讽刺地问道。他曾是辛森，这位年轻人的密友。","“You call it lunch, don’t you?”  asked the eldest son, almost ironical.He had once been an intimate friend of this young man."
"“等我们吃完后，会给阿迪些吃的。”病弱的母亲反对道。","“We’ll give Addy something when we’ve finished,” said the mother, an invalid, deprecating."
"“不——不用麻烦。我不想给你们添任何麻烦。”辛森说道。","“No—don’t trouble.I don’t want to give you any trouble,” said Syson."
"“你就靠这新鲜的空气和美丽的景色过活吧！”十九岁的小儿子笑着说。","“You could allus live on fresh air an’ scenery,” laughed the youngest son, a lad of nineteen."
"辛森绕过这些房屋，进到屋后的果园里。在那里，沿着树篱生长的水仙花左右摇荡，就像栖息在树枝上竖起羽毛的黄色鸟儿一样。他特别喜爱这个地方。这里山峦环绕，熊皮似的树林遍布于它们的谷肩之上，小小的红色农场像胸针一样别在它们的外衣上；山谷间流淌着一股蓝色的清泉，家用牧场则是光秃秃的，鸟儿们叽叽喳喳地唱着，虽然通常没有人会听。即使到他生命的最后一刻，他都会梦到这里，感受洒向面颊的阳光，欣赏冬日细枝间的几捧白雪，或者闻闻春天来临的气息。","Syson went round the buildings, and into the orchard at the back of the house, where daffodils all along the hedgerow swung like yellow, ruffled birds on their perches.He loved the place extraordinarily, the hills ranging round, with bear-skin woods covering their giant shoulders, and small red farms like brooches clasping their garments; the blue streak of water in the valley, the bareness of the home pasture, the sound of myriad-threaded bird-singing, which went mostly unheard.To his last day, he would dream of this place, when he felt the sun on his face, or saw the small handfuls of snow between the winter twigs, or smelt the coming of spring."
"希尔达很有女人味儿。只要她在场，辛森就会感到局促不安。他俩都是二十九岁，但希尔达看上去比他大很多。在她身边，他觉得自己很傻，近乎虚幻。她是那么的恬静。当他正在拨弄低枝上那即将脱落的李子花时，希尔达来到后门抖台布。家禽在草堆旁竞相追逐，鸟儿在树林间欢腾雀跃。她把乌黑的头发盘成一圈，像戴着一顶王冠。她举止很坦然，又很疏远。她叠起台布时，远眺群山。","Hilda was very womanly.In her presence he felt constrained.She was twenty-nine, as he was, but she seemed to him much older.He felt foolish, almost unreal, beside her.She was so static.As he was fingering some shed plum blossom on a low bough, she came to the back door to shake the table-cloth.Fowls raced from the stackyard, birds rustled from the trees.Her dark hair was gathered up in a coil like a crown on her head.She was very straight, distant in her bearing.As she folded the cloth, she looked away over the hills."
"没过一会，辛森回到了屋里。希尔达准备好了鸡蛋、乳酪、炖过的醋栗和奶油。","Presently Syson returned indoors.She had prepared eggs and curd cheese, stewed gooseberries and cream."
"“鉴于你今晚要吃正餐，”她说，“我只是给你准备了份清淡的午餐。”","“Since you will dine tonight,” she said, “I have only given you a light lunch.”"
"“这真是太好了。”辛森说道，“你始终保持着一种真正质朴田园的风格——看你那用稻草和常青藤花蕾编成的腰带就知道了。”","“It is awfully nice,” he said.“You keep a real idyllic atmosphere—your belt of straw and ivy buds.”"
"他们仍在彼此伤害着。","Still they hurt each other."
"辛森在她面前感到不自在。她简洁果断的言语，她疏远的举止，都令他感觉很陌生。辛森又一次羡慕起她灰黑的眼眉和睫毛。他们的目光相遇了。在她美丽的灰黑色眼睛一瞥的瞬间，他看到了眼泪和一束奇异的光。而在这一切的背后，辛森看到了她对她自己的平静接受，也看到了战胜他的欢欣喜悦。","He was uneasy before her.Her brief, sure speech, her distant bearing, were unfamiliar to him.He admired again her grey-black eyebrows, and her lashes.Their eyes met.He saw, in the beautiful grey and black of her glance, tears and a strange light, and at the back of all, calm acceptance of herself, and triumph over him."
"他感觉到自己在萎缩。他努力保持着一种嘲弄的姿态。","He felt himself shrinking.With an effort he kept up the ironic manner."
"希尔达把他送入起居室，自己去刷盘子。这个又长又矮的房间是用修道院的拍卖品重新布置的：放着年头很久的紫红色棱纹平布垫的椅子，一张椭圆形的抛光胡桃木桌，还有一架钢琴，尽管已经算是古董了，但依然美观。虽然有些陌生，他还是很满意的。辛森打开一扇嵌在厚墙之中的高橱柜，发现里面装满了他的书，他的旧课本，还有他曾寄她的诗集，有英语的、有德语的。白色窗户下的水仙花映照着房间，他几乎能感觉到它们的光芒。这种古老的魅力再一次迷住了他。墙上挂着他年轻时画的水彩画，它们已经无法再令他满意了。他记起十二年前他是多么激情洋溢地为她作画。","She sent him into the parlour while she washed the dishes.The long low room was refurnished from the Abbey sale, with chairs upholstered in claret-coloured rep, many years old, and an oval table of polished walnut, and another piano, handsome, though still antique.In spite of the strangeness, he was pleased.Opening a high cupboard let into the thickness of the wall, he found it full of his books, his old lesson-books, and volumes of verse he had sent her, English and German.The daffodils in the white window-bottoms shone across the room, he could almost feel their rays.The old glamour caught him again.His youthful water-colours on the wall no longer made him grin; he remembered how fervently he had tried to paint for her, twelve years before."
"希尔达擦着盘子进来了，他又一次看到她那果仁般白皙的美丽双臂。","She entered, wiping a dish, and he saw again the bright, kernel-white beauty of her arms."
"“你在这儿真的很棒。”辛森说，继而他们四目相对。","“You are quite splendid here,” he said, and their eyes met."
"“你喜欢吗？”希尔达问道。这是一种旧识的、低沉而又沙哑的亲密语气。他感到一种源自血液的快速变化。这是一种古老而有趣的升华，他感到自己变薄，几乎快要蒸发，好像灵魂就要获得释放一样。","“Do you like it?” she asked.It was the old, low, husky tone of intimacy.He felt a quick change beginning in his blood.It was the old, delicious sublimation, the thinning, almost the vaporizing of himself, as if his spirit were to be liberated."
"“嗯。”辛森点点头，又像小男孩一样冲着希尔达微笑。她低下了头。","“Aye,” he nodded, smiling at her like a boy again.She bowed her head."
"“这是伯爵夫人的椅子，”　她低声说道，“我在椅垫中发现了她的剪刀。”","“This was the countess’s chair,” she said in low tones.“I found her scissors down here between the padding.”"
"“是吗？在哪儿呢？”","“Did you?Where are they?”"
"她动作轻快迅速地取来工具盒，然后两人仔细地检查起这把旧长柄剪刀来。","Quickly, with a lilt in her movement, she fetched her work-basket, and together they examined the long-shanked old scissors."
"“逝去红颜几多歌啊！”辛森笑着吟诵道，一面将手指伸入伯爵夫人剪刀的圆环。","“What a ballad of deal ladies!”he said, laughing, as he fitted his fingers into the round loops of the countess’s scissors."
"“我就知道你能用它。”希尔达肯定地说。他看看自己的手，又看看剪刀。希尔达的意思是他的手用这种小环的剪刀刚刚好。","“I knew you could use them,” she said, with certainty.He looked at his fingers, and at the scissors.She meant his fingers were fine enough for the small-looped scissors."
"“这可能就是为我准备的。”辛森把剪刀放到一边，笑着说。希尔达转向窗户。辛森注意到她美丽嫩白的双颊和上唇，她柔软白皙的脖子如荨麻花的管颈一般，前臂像刚漂白的果仁一样有光泽。他用新奇的眼光看着希尔达。对他而言，她已经完全变了。他曾经不了解她。但现在他可以客观地看待她了。","“That is something to be said for me,” he laughed, putting the scissors aside.She turned to the window.He noticed the fine, fair down on her cheek and her upper lip, and her soft, white neck, like the throat of a nettle flower, and her fore-arms, bright as newly blanched kernels.He was looking at her with new eyes, and she was a different person to him.He did not know her.But he could regard her objectively now."
"“我们出去走一会儿，好吗？”希尔达问道。","“Shall we go out awhile?” she asked."
"“好啊！”辛森答道。可是惧怕占据了他的情感，他惧怕他所看到的一切。这种情感使他兴奋而复杂的心情感到不安。她现在的举止，说话的语调跟以前一模一样，但她已不再是他所认识的希尔达了。他非常清楚她以前是怎样的。他逐渐认识到她已经完全变成了另外一个人，并且永远会这样。","“Yes!” he answered.But the predominant emotion, that troubled the excitement and perplexity of his heart, was fear, fear of that which he saw.There was about her the same manner, the same intonation in her voice, now as then, but she was not what he had known her to be.He knew quite well what she had been for him.And gradually he was realizing that she was something quite other, and always had been."
"希尔达没带头巾，只是解下围裙说：“我们沿着松林走。”他们途经一片老果园的时候，希尔达叫他看了一棵苹果树上的蓝山雀巢，还有树篱中的山鹬窝。她肯定的语气中带着些许生硬，就像隐藏在她谦卑之下的傲慢，这使辛森感到十分惊讶。","She put no covering on her head, merely took off her apron, saying, “We will go by the larches.”As they passed the old orchard, she called him in to show him a blue-tit’s nest in one of the apple trees, and a sycock’s in the hedge.He rather wondered at her surety, at a certain hardness like arrogance hidden under her humility."
"“看这些苹果芽。”她说，这时辛森才觉察到下垂的树枝间长着无数猩红色的小球。她看着他的脸，眼神变得生硬起来。她看到辛森逐渐减少对她的注意了，最终他会像她看他一样地看着她。这是希尔达过去最怕的事情，可从心灵上讲，这又是她最需要的。现在辛森就要像希尔达看他一样地看着她了。他不会爱她了，他也会明白他从来就未曾爱过她。昔日的幻想已经破灭，他们彻底地成为陌生人了。但是辛森会给希尔达她应得的东西——她会从他那里得到自己应得的一切。","“Look at the apple buds,” she said, and he then perceived myriads of little scarlet balls among the drooping boughs.Watching his face, her eyes went hard.She saw the scales were fallen from him, and at last he was going to see her as she was.It was the thing she had most dreaded in the past, and most needed, for her soul’s sake.Now he was going to see her as she was.He would not love her, and he would know he never could have loved her.The old illusion gone, they were strangers, crude and entire.But he would give her her due—she would have her due from him."
"她聪慧美丽，就好像他不曾认识她一样。希尔达将鸟巢指给他看：是一簇低矮灌木中的雌鹪鹩巢。","She was brilliant as he had not known her.She showed him nests: a jenny wren’s in a low bush."
"“瞧这巧妇鸟的窝！”她惊呼道。","“See this jinty’s!” she exlaimed."
"听到她用俗称，辛森很惊讶。她小心地穿过刺丛来到窝边，然后把手指进了鸟巢的圆形小门。","He was surprised to hear her use the local name.She reached carefully through the thorns, and put her fingers in the nest’s round door."
"“五个！”她说道。“多小的家伙儿。”","“Five!” she said.“Tiny little things.”"
"她带辛森看了很多鸟巢，有知更鸟的、花鸡的、红雀的和白颊鸟的，还有水边的鹡鸰鸟巢。","She showed him nests of robins, and chaffinches, and linnets, and buntings; of a wagtail beside the water."
"“如果我们走下去，更靠近湖边，我会给你看翠鸟的……”","“And if we go down, nearer the lake, I will show you a kingfisher’s...”"
"“在这些小冷杉树中，”她说，“几乎每根树干、每枝丫杈上都有画眉鸟巢或者乌鸦巢。当我第一天看到这些时，我觉得好像自己不能进入林中。它就像一座鸟的城市。清晨，听到鸟儿的叫声，我便想起了喧闹嘈杂的早市。我害怕走进自己的树林。”","“Among the young fir trees,” she said, “there’s a throstle’s or a blackie’s on nearly every bough, every ledge.The first day, when I had seen them all, I felt as if I mustn’t go in the wood.It seemed a city of birds: and in the morning, hearing them all, I thought of the noisy early markets.I was afraid to go in my own wood.”"
"希尔达正用着他俩共同创造的语言。现在这语言只属于她自己了。辛森已经不用了。希尔达并不介意他的沉默，而总是很主动地带他看她的树林。他们一起走上一条湿软的小路，那里盛开的勿忘草随风摆动，绘成一股炫蓝色的水流。“我们认识所有的鸟儿，可是有很多花儿我们却叫不上名来。”她说。这有一半是在邀请辛森讲话，因为他曾经知道这些事物的名字。","She was using the language they had both of them invented.Now it was all her own.He had done with it.She did not mind his silence, but was always dominant, letting him see her wood.As they came along a marshy path where forget-me-nots were opening in a rich blue drift: “We know all the birds, but there are many flowers we can’t find out,” she said.It was half an appeal to him, who had known the names of things."
"希尔达迷迷糊糊地望向那片酣睡在阳光下的开阔地。","She looked dreamily across to the open fields that slept in the sun."
"“你知道，我也有个情人。”她说道，语气先是肯定，但进而又几乎成了亲密。","“I have a lover as well, you know,” she said, with assurance, yet dropping again almost into the intimate tone."
"这激起了辛森和她斗嘴的情绪。","This woke in him the spirit to fight her."
"“我想我见过他。他很帅——而且生活在这淳朴宁静的世外桃源。”","“I think I met him.He is good-looking—also in Arcady.”"
"她没有回应，而是转入一条通往山上的幽暗小径，那里的树和灌木非常浓密。","Without answering, she turned into a dark path that led up-hill, where the trees and undergrowth were very thick."
"“他们之前做得很好，”她终于开口说道，“上什么庙就敬什么神。”","“They did well,” she said at length, “to have various altars to various gods, in old days.”"
"“啊，是啊！”辛森赞同道。“最近敬什么新神呢？”","“Ah yes!” he agreed.“To whom is the new one?”"
"“没有什么旧神了，”她说，“我总是一直在找。”","“There are no old ones,” she said.“I was always looking for this.”"
"“是谁呢？”辛森问。","“And whose is it?” he asked."
"“我不知道。”希尔达注视着他回答道。","“I don’t know,” she said, looking full at him."
"“看到你这样子，我很高兴你很满意。”辛森说道。","“I’m very glad, for your sake,” he said, “that you are satisfied.”"
"“是啊——可是男人并不是那么重要。”她说。一阵短暂的沉默。","“Aye—but the man doesn’t matter so much,” she said.There was a pause."
"“不重要！”他惊呼道，同时却认识了真实的她。","“No!” he exlaimed, astonished, yet recognizing her as her real self."
"“一个人的自我才是最重要的。”她说，“无论这个人是在做自己，还是在为他自己的上帝服务。”","“It is one’s self that matters,” she said.“Whether one is being one’s own self and serving one’s own God.”"
"又是一阵沉默，辛森也陷入了沉思。这条小路几乎没有花，显得阴沉昏暗。在路边，辛森的脚跟陷进了软泥里。","There was silence, during which he pondered.The path was almost flowerless, gloomy.At the side, his heels sank into soft clay."
"第三章","CHAPTER III"
"“我，”希尔达慢慢地说道，“我在你结婚的当天晚上也结婚了。”","“I,” she said, very slowly, “I was married the same night as you.”"
"辛森看着她。","He looked at her."
"“当然不是法律上的，”她回应说，“但——是事实上的。”","“Not legally, of course,” she replied.“But—actually.”"
"“跟那个守林人？”他说，不知道还能说些什么好。","“To the keeper?” he said, not knowing what else to say."
"希尔达转向他。","She turned to him."
"“你认为不可以吗？”她说。","“You thought I could not?” she said."
"她想表现得泰然自若，可是脸却变得通红，一直红到了脸颊和喉咙。","But the flush was deep in her cheek and throat, for all her assurance."
"辛森依然什么也没说。","Still he would not say anything."
"“你看”——她努力解释道——“我也不得不去理解。”","“You see”—she was making an effort to explain—“I had to understand also.”"
"“你所说的‘理解’是什么意思？”辛森问道。","“And what does it amount to, this UNDERSTANDING?” he asked."
"“意思很多——你对它的理解不是那样吗？”希尔达答道，“其中之一就是自由。”","“A very great deal—does it not to you?” she replied.“One is free.”"
"“那么你并不失望？”","“And you are not disappointed?”"
"“当然不！”她的语气低沉而又真挚。","“Far from it!”Her tone was deep and sincere."
"“你爱他？”","“You love him?”"
"“是的，我爱他。”","“Yes, I love him.”"
"“很好！”辛森说。","“Good!” he said."
"这话使希尔达沉默了一会。","This silenced her for a while."
"“在这儿，在他的世界里，我爱她。”她说道。","“Here, among his things, I love him,” she said."
"自负使辛森无法保持沉默。","His conceit would not let him be silent."
"“爱还需要环境？”他问。","“It needs this setting?” he asked."
"“当然了。”希尔达叫道，“你总是把我弄得不是我自己。”","“It does,” she cried.“You were always making me to be not myself.”"
"辛森短促地笑了一下。","He laughed shortly."
"“但这是环境的问题？”他说。他已考虑到了她所有的心绪。","“But is it a matter of surroundings?” he said.He had considered her all spirit."
"“我就像一株植物，”她回答道，“我只能生长在我自己的土壤里。”","“I am like a plant,” she replied.“I can only grow in my own soil.”"
"他们来到一处地方，那里灌木丛渐渐稀疏，露出一片光秃秃的棕褐色的空地，只有砖红色的、又有点发紫的松树像柱子似的立在那儿。边缘是暗绿色的大树，长着花蕾。树下则是燕尾旗般鲜亮舒展的蕨类植物。在这片空地的中央，立着一座守林人的圆木小屋。野鸡笼随处乱放着，有的笼子里装着咯咯叫的母鸡，有的则空着。","They came to a place where the undergrowth shrank away, leaving a bare, brown space, pillared with the brick-red and purplish trunks of pine trees.On the fringe, hung the sombre green of elder trees, with flat flowers in bud, and below were bright, unfurling pennons of fern.In the midst of the bare space stood a keeper’s log hut.Pheasant-coops were lying about, some occupied by a clucking hen, some empty."
"希尔达踩着褐色的松针来到屋前，从屋檐下取出一把钥匙，打开了门。这是一间没有什么装饰盒陈设的木质房屋，里面有木匠的工作台和模具，还有木匠会用到的工具，包括斧头、套索、皮带，还有一些用木钉钉住的兽皮。一切都井然有序。希尔达关上屋门。辛森仔细查看着那些平摊着的、古怪的野兽皮。它们被木钉钉住以便加工处理。希尔达转动侧墙的节疤，又打开了一个小房间。","Hilda walked over the brown pine-needles to the hut, took a key from among the eaves, and opened the door.It was a bare wooden place with a carpenter’s bench and form, carpenter’s tools, an axe, snares, straps, some skins pegged down, everything in order.Hilda closed the door.Syson examined the weird flat coats of wild animals, that were pegged down to be cured.She turned some knotch in the side wall, and disclosed a second, small apartment."
"“真浪漫啊！”辛森说道。","“How romantic!” said Syson."
"“是的。他很有好奇心，还有着野兽的狡猾——这里是褒义；他富于创造性而且很有思想，但又不会超过一定的限度。”","“Yes.He is very curious—he has some of a wild animal’s cunning—in a nice sense—and he is inventive, and thoughtful—but not beyond a certain point.”"
"她拉开深绿色的窗帘。这房间几乎完全被一张印有石南花和欧洲蕨图案的大沙发给占满了。沙发上铺着一块宽大的兔毛毯。地板上是拼缝的猫皮地毯，还有一张红色小牛皮。其他各种毛皮则挂在墙上。希尔达取下一件穿在身上。这是一件兔皮斗篷，中间夹杂着白色的毛，还有一个兜帽，显然是用鼬皮做的。她披着这件带有野蛮气息的斗篷笑着对辛森说：","She pulled back a dark green curtain.The apartment was occupied almost entirely by a large couch of heather and bracken, on which was spread an ample rabbit-skin rug.On the floor were patchwork rugs of cat-skin, and a red calf-skin, while hanging from the wall were other furs.Hilda took down one, which she put on.It was a cloak of rabbit-skin and of white fur, with a hood, apparently of the skins of stoats.She laughed at Syson from out of this barbaric mantle, saying:"
"“你觉得这件怎么样？”","“What do you think of it?”"
"“噢——！我替你的男人向你祝贺。”他回答道。","“Ah—!I congratulate you on your man,” he replied."
"“看！”她说。","“And look!” she said."
"架子上的小瓶里插着几株小枝，是今年最早开出的金银花，脆弱而又苍白。","In a little jar on a shelf were some sprays, frail and white, of the first honeysuckle."
"“晚上这里会香气四溢。”她说。","“They will scent the place at night,” she said."
"辛森好奇地环顾着四周。","He looked round curiously."
"“那么他的不足在哪儿呢？”他问道。希尔达盯了辛森一会。然后，她转过脸去：","“Where does he come short, then?” he asked.She gazed at him for a few moments.Then, turning aside:"
"“星星对他而言是不一样的，”她说，“你可以使它们闪烁颤动，而勿忘草对我而言仿佛是磷火。你可以使事情变得美好。我已经发现了这一点——确实如此。可是现在我自己已经拥有这美好的一切了。”","“The stars aren’t the same with him,” she said.“You could make them flash and quiver, and the forget-me-nots come up at me like phosphorescence.You could make things WONDERFUL.I have found it out—it is true.But I have them all for myself, now.”"
"辛森笑了，说道：","He laughed, saying:"
"“毕竟，星星和勿忘草都只是奢侈品。你应该写诗。”","“After all, stars and forget-me-nots are only luxuries.You ought to make poetry.”"
"“是啊，”她赞同地说道，“但是我现在拥有了这美好的一切。”","“Aye,” she assented.“But I have them all now.”"
"辛森又对着希尔达苦笑了一次。","Again he laughed bitterly at her."
"她迅速地转过身。房间狭小而昏暗。辛森倚着房间的小窗注视着希尔达。此刻她站在门口，仍穿着斗篷。辛森摘掉了帽子，因此希尔达依然能够在昏暗的房间里清楚地看到他的头和脸。他黑亮的直发整齐地从额前梳向后面。他黑色的眼睛正注视着她。他的脸忽隐忽现，白净细腻，并且十分光滑。","She turned swiftly.He was leaning against the small window of the tiny, obscure room, and was watching her, who stood in the doorway, still cloaked in her mantle.His cap was removed, so she saw his face and head distinctly in the dim room.His black, straight, glossy hair was brushed clean back from his brow.His black eyes were watching her, and his face, that was clear and cream, and perfectly smooth, was flickering."
"“我们是完全不同的。”她苦涩地说道。","“We are very different,” she said bitterly."
"他又笑了。","Again he laughed."
"“我看你是不认可我。”他说。","“I see you disapprove of me,” he said."
"“我是不认可你变成这样。”她说。","“I disapprove of what you have become,” she said."
"“你认为我们可能”——他瞥了一眼小屋——“会像这样，你和我？”","“You think we might”—he glanced at the hut—“have been like this—you and I?”"
"她摇摇头。","She shook her head."
"“你！不，永远不会！你摘下一样东西，看着它，直到你了解了你想知道的关于它的一切，然后就扔掉它。”她说。","“You! no; never!You plucked a thing and looked at it till you had found out all you wanted to know about it, then you threw it away,” she said."
"“我是这样吗？” 他问道。“难到你走的路永远不可能是我的路？我不这么认为。”","“Did I?” he asked.“And could your way never have been my way?I suppose not.”"
"“为什么不？”她说道。","“Why should it?” she said."
"“我是个独立的人。”","“I am a separate being.”"
"“但可以肯定的是，两个人有时也会走相同的路。”辛森说道。","“But surely two people sometimes go the same way,” he said."
"“是你让我失去了自我。”她说。","“You took me away from myself,” she said."
"辛森知道自己误解了希尔达，把她误认为她本不是的那种人。那是他的错，而不是希尔达的错。","He knew he had mistaken her, had taken her for something she was not.That was his fault, not hers."
"“你一直都知道吗？”他问道。","“And did you always know?” he asked."
"“不，你从来都不让我知道。你欺侮我。我无法自制。你离开我的时候我很高兴，真的。”","“No—you never let me know.You bullied me.I couldn’t help myself.I was glad when you left me, really.”"
"“我知道。”辛森说。但是他的脸色愈加苍白，几乎泛着死一样的光。","“I know you were,” he said.But his face went paler, almost deathly luminous."
"“可是，”他说道，“是你让我走上这条路的。”","“Yet,” he said, “it was you who sent me the way I have gone.”"
"“我！”希尔达傲慢地惊呼道。","“I!” she exclaimed, in pride."
"“你让我获得文法学校的奖学金——你让我培养了可怜的小波泰尔对我狂热的爱恋，直到她不能没有我——因为波泰尔有权有势。你成功地说服酒商出资送我去剑桥读书，去帮助他唯一的儿子。 你想让我在这个世界上有所成就。并且你总是把我从你身边支开——我每一次新的成功都会使我们彼此分离，为你更甚于为我。你从不想和我在一起，你只是想要送我去看看外面是什么样子。我相信你甚至想让我娶一位淑女。你想通过我来征服这个社会。”","“You WOULD have me take the Grammar School scholarship—and you would have me foster poor little Botell’s fervent attachment to me, till she couldn’t live without me—and because Botell was rich and influential.You triumphed in the wine-merchant’s offer to send me to Cambridge, to befriend his only child.You wanted me to rise in the world.And all the time you were sending me away from you—every new success of mine put a separation between us, and more for you than for me.You never wanted to come with me: you wanted just to send me to see what it was like.I believe you even wanted me to marry a lady.You wanted to triumph over society in me.”"
"“那我会负责任的。”希尔达讥讽道。","“And I am responsible,” she said, with sarcasm."
"“我出人头地就是为了让你满意。”辛森说道。","“I distinguished myself to satisfy you,” he replied."
"“哈！”她叫喊道，“你总是想要改变，改变，像个孩子。”","“Ah!” she cried, “you always wanted change, change, like a child.”"
"“很好！而且我知道我成功了，我也从事着相当不错的工作。但是——我想你可不一样。你有什么权利这样对待一个男人？”","“Very well!And I am a success, and I know it, and I do some good work.But—I thought you were different.What right have you to a man?”"
"“你要怎样？”希尔达看着他说，睁大的眼睛里充满了畏惧。","“What do you want?” she said, looking at him with wide, fearful eyes."
"辛森回头看了她一眼，目光如兵器般犀利。","He looked back at her, his eyes pointed, like weapons."
"“哼，不怎样啊。”他短促地一笑。","“Why, nothing,” he laughed shortly."
"屋外的门闩卡嗒作响，守林人走了进来。这女人四下环视，但是依然身着皮斗篷，站在屋门里。辛森没有动。","There was a rattling at the outer latch, and the keeper entered.The woman glanced round, but remained standing, fur-cloaked, in the inner doorway.Syson did not move."
"那个男人走了进来，看了看，然后一声不吭地走开了。两人也沉默着。","The other man entered, saw, and turned away without speaking.The two also were silent."
"佩尔比姆专心地打理着他的毛皮。","Pilbeam attended to his skins."
"“我得走了。”辛森说。","“I must go,” said Syson."
"“是的。”希尔达回答道。","“Yes,” she replied."
"“那我送你一句‘为了我们丰富多彩的命运。’”他举手宣誓道。","“Then I give you ‘To our vast and varying fortunes.’” He lifted his hand in pledge."
"“‘为了我们丰富多彩的命运。’”她严肃地回应，语气冷淡。","“‘To our vast and varying fortunes,’” she answered gravely, and speaking in cold tones."
"“阿瑟！”她说道。","“Arthur!” she said."
"守林人假装没听到。辛森看得真切，开始微笑了起来。女人挺起身来。","The keeper pretended not to hear.Syson, watching keenly, began to smile.The woman drew herself up."
"“阿瑟！”她用一种古怪的升调再次喊道。这声音在警示着两个男人，她的心灵正因为一场危机而颤抖。","“Arthur!” she said again, with a curious upward inflection, which warned the two men that her soul was trembling on a dangerous crisis."
"守林人慢慢地放下手中的工具走向她。","The keeper slowly put down his tool and came to her."
"“是，”他说。","“Yes,” he said."
"“我想给你介绍——”希尔达用颤抖的声音说道。","“I wanted to introduce you,” she said, trembling."
"“我已见过他了。”守林人说。","“I’ve met him a’ready,” said the keeper."
"“是吗？这位是阿迪，就是辛森先生，你知道的。——这是阿瑟·佩尔比姆先生。”她转向辛森补充说。辛森向守林人伸出手，然后他们默默地握了手。","“Have you?It is Addy, Mr Syson, whom you know about.—This is Arthur, Mr Pilbeam,” she added, turning to Syson.The latter held out his hand to the keeper, and they shook hands in silence."
"“很高兴见到你。”辛森说，“我们要中断联系吗，希尔达？”","“I’m glad to have met you,” said Syson.“We drop our correspondence, Hilda?”"
"“为什么要？”希尔达问道。","“Why need we?” she asked."
"两个男人困惑地站在那儿。","The two men stood at a loss."
"“没有必要吗？”辛森问道。","“IS there no need?” said Syson."
"她依旧沉默着。","Still she was silent."
"“随你便吧。”她说道。","“It is as you will,” she said."
"他们三人一起沿着阴暗的小径走了下去。","They went all three together down the gloomy path."
"“‘天空多么湛蓝，而希望是多么殷切（原文为法语）。’”辛森不知说些什么好，便引用了诗句。","“‘Qu’il était bleu, le ciel, et grand l’espoir,’” quoted Syson, not knowing what to say."
"“你什么意思？”她问道，“另外，我们不能这样轻率放荡地走下去——我们从未埋下过那样的种子。”","“What do you mean?” she said.“Besides, WE can’t walk in OUR wild oats—we never sowed any.”"
"辛森看着她。看着他年轻的情人，他的修女，他的波提切利天使如此地呈现在他面前，他感到一阵惊愕。是他自己犯了傻。 他们俩已经比任何两个陌生人还要疏远了。她只是想和他保持联系——而他，当然也想维持，这样他才可以写信给她，就像但丁对只在他脑海中存在过的比阿特丽斯的感情一样。","Syson looked at her.He was startled to see his young love, his nun, his Botticelli angel, so revealed.It was he who had been the fool.He and she were more separate than any two strangers could be.She only wanted to keep up a correspondence with him—and he, of course, wanted it kept up, so that he could write to her, like Dante to some Beatrice who had never existed save in the man’s own brain."
"在小路的尽头，希尔达离开了辛森。于是，他和守林人一起走向开阔地，走向林边的大门。两人几乎像朋友一样地走着。他们并不表露各自心中的想法。","At the bottom of the path she left him.He went along with the keeper, towards the open, towards the gate that closed on the wood.The two men walked almost like friends.They did not broach the subject of their thoughts."
"辛森并未径直走向大路口，而是沿着林边走。溪水蔓延到一片小沼泽；桤木树下、芦苇丛中，一大株一大株金黄色的万寿菊在阳光下闪耀着。棕色的溪流如缕缕丝线流淌着，与花朵的金黄色交相辉映。突然空中一道蓝光闪现，有一只翠鸟飞过。","Instead of going straight to the high-road gate, Syson went along the wood’s edge, where the brook spread out in a little bog, and under the alder trees, among the reeds, great yellow stools and bosses of marigolds shone.Threads of brown water trickled by, touched with gold from the flowers.Suddenly there was a blue flash in the air, as a kingfisher passed."
"辛森格外感动。他爬上河岸来到荆豆丛中，零星的花朵尚未簇拥成花的海洋。辛森躺在褐色的枯草皮上，发现了几小枝紫色的远志和少许粉红的马先蒿。这是一个多么美妙的世界啊——精彩绝伦，总是崭新的。尽管他感觉这仿佛是在地下，像是一成不变的地狱的旷野。他胸中的痛楚就像伤口一样疼痛。他记起了威廉·莫里斯的诗句。诗中描绘了里昂内斯教堂中一位受伤的骑士躺在地上，矛柄深深地刺入他胸膛的情景。他如死去一般躺着，但又没有死，日复一日，斑斓的阳光透过彩色玻璃窗照到圣坛，而后又逝去。他现在知道，他和希尔达之间的事情绝不可能是真的，从来也没有过。真相始终相去甚远。","Syson was extraordinarily moved.He climbed the bank to the gorse bushes, whose sparks of blossom had not yet gathered into a flame.Lying on the dry brown turf, he discovered sprigs of tiny purple milkwort and pink spots of lousewort.What a wonderful world it was—marvellous, for ever new.He felt as if it were underground, like the fields of monotone hell, notwithstanding.Inside his breast was a pain like a wound.He remembered the poem of William Morris, where in the Chapel of Lyonesse a knight lay wounded, with the truncheon of a spear deep in his breast, lying always as dead, yet did not die, while day after day the coloured sunlight dipped from the painted window across the chancel, and passed away.He knew now it never had been true, that which was between him and her, not for a moment.The truth had stood apart all the time."
"辛森翻了个身。空气中洋溢着百灵鸟的歌声，仿佛阳光浓缩后像阵雨般落下来。在这欢快的叫声之中，人的说话声听起来虽小却也清晰。","Syson turned over.The air was full of the sound of larks, as if the sunshine above were condensing and falling in a shower.Amid this bright sound, voices sounded small and distinct."
"“可要是他结婚了，而且心甘情愿地放弃，怎么还要反对呢？”一个男人的声音说道。","“But if he’s married, an’ quite willing to drop it off, what has her against it?” said the man’s voice."
"“我现在不想谈这事儿。我想单独呆会儿。”","“I don’t want to talk about it now.I want to be alone.”"
"辛森透过灌木丛看过去。希尔达正站在靠近门口的树林之中。守林人在田野里，徘徊于树篱边上，玩弄着那些停在白荆棘花上的蜜蜂。","Syson looked through the bushes.Hilda was standing in the wood, near the gate.The man was in the field, loitering by the hedge, and playing with the bees as they settled on the white bramble flowers."
"一阵沉默。辛森此时想象着希尔达的心绪正沉浸在百鸟灵的明快歌声中。突然守林人惊呼“啊！”并咒骂了一声。他正紧紧地抓住外套衣袖靠近肩膀的地方。接着他脱掉夹克，把它扔到了地上，然后聚精会神地把衬衣袖卷到肩膀。","There was silence for a while, in which Syson imagined her will among the brightness of the larks.Suddenly the keeper exclaimed “Ah!” and swore.He was gripping at the sleeve of his coat, near the shoulder.Then he pulled off his jacket, threw it on the ground, and absorbedly rolled up his shirt sleeve right to the shoulder."
"“啊！”他报复似地说，一面捉起蜜蜂并把它丢到一旁。他将纤细光亮的胳膊扭过来，笨拙地朝肩膀上看去。","“Ah!” he said vindictively, as he picked out the bee and flung it away.He twisted his fine, bright arm, peering awkwardly over his shoulder."
"“怎么了?”希尔达问道。","“What is it?” asked Hilda."
"“一只蜜蜂——爬进了我的袖子。”他答道。","“A bee—crawled up my sleeve,” he answered."
"“到我这儿来。”希尔达说。","“Come here to me,” she said."
"守林人走向她，就像一个生气的男孩。她用手抓住他的胳膊。","The keeper went to her, like a sulky boy.She took his arm in her hands."
"“在这儿——刺留在里面了——可恶的蜜蜂！”","“Here it is—and the sting left in—poor bee!”"
"她挑出刺，把嘴贴在他的胳膊上，把毒汁吸了出来。当她看到留在他胳膊上的红唇印时，她笑着说：","She picked out the sting, put her mouth to his arm, and sucked away the drop of poison.As she looked at the red mark her mouth had made, and at his arm, she said, laughing:"
"“这将是你有生以来得到的最火热的吻了。”","“That is the reddest kiss you will ever have.”"
"当辛森接下来抬头朝人声处望去时，他看到树阴中守林人正吻着他爱人的脖颈。希尔达的头向后仰着，头发散了下来，一绺毛糙的茶褐色头发垂在守林人裸露的手臂上。","When Syson next looked up, at the sound of voices, he saw in the shadow the keeper with his mouth on the throat of his beloved, whose head was thrown back, and whose hair had fallen, so that one rough rope of dark brown hair hung across his bare arm."
"“不，”女人说道，“我不是因为他走了而心烦意乱的。你不会懂的……”","“No,” the woman answered.“I am not upset because he’s gone.You won’t understand...”"
"辛森听不出守林人在说些什么。希尔达的回答却清晰而肯定：","Syson could not distinguish what the man said.Hilda replied, clear and distinct:"
"“你知道我爱你。他已经完全走出了我的生活——不要再因为他而烦恼了...”他吻了她，嘴里嘟囔着些什么。她空洞地笑了笑。","“You know I love you.He has gone quite out of my life—don’t trouble about him...”He kissed her, murmuring.She laughed hollowly."
"“好的。”她说道，言语中透着溺爱，“我们会结婚的，我们会结婚的。但现在还不能。”守林人又对她说了些话。辛森一度什么也听不到。然后希尔达说：","“Yes,” she said, indulgent.“We will be married, we will be married.But not just yet.”He spoke to her again.Syson heard nothing for a time.Then she said:"
"“你必须回家，就现在，亲爱的——你会睡不着的。”","“You must go home, now, dear—you will get no sleep.”"
"然后又是守林人喃喃的声音，为恐惧和激情而苦恼着。","Again was heard the murmur of the keeper’s voice, troubled by fear and passion."
"“可是我们为什么要马上结婚呢？”她问道。“结了婚你又会多得到些什么？”像现在这样最美好了。”","“But why should we be married at once?” she said.“What more would you have, by being married?It is most beautiful as it is.”"
"终于，守林人穿上外套离开了。希尔达站在门口，并没看他，而是掠过阳光明媚的村庄眺向远方。","At last he pulled on his coat and departed.She stood at the gate, not watching him, but looking over the sunny country."
"在她最终离去的时候，辛森也动身返城了。","When at last she had gone, Syson also departed, going back to town."
