"画家历险记","The Painter’s Adventure"
"作者：华盛顿·欧文","by Washington Irving"
"就职业来说，我是一名历史画家，有段时间我住在国外的一位公爵家中；他的别墅距离罗马约十五英里，而周边是意大利最引人入胜的风景。那幢别墅坐落在古老的图斯库鲁高地上。周围是西塞罗、苏拉、卢卡勒斯、拉菲纳斯以及另外一些著名的罗马人的别墅废墟，当年这些人偶尔来这里享受片刻的舒适和惬意,以舒缓常日的辛劳。身处悠然怡情的林阴下，独享清爽的山间微风，饱览充满诗情画意，以及历史岁月的动人景致，这的确让人精神焕发。位于阿尔巴尼亚山中的蒂沃理曾是贺拉斯和米西纳斯最钟爱的住所。台伯河流淌过宽阔、荒芜萧瑟的肯伯格纳，圣彼得大教堂的穹顶俯瞰着四周，就如古罗马废墟的纪念碑一般。","I am an historical painter by profession, and resided for some time in the family of a foreign prince, at his villa, about fifteen miles from Rome, among some of the most interesting scenery of Italy.It is situated on the heights of ancient Tusculum.In its neighborhood are the ruins of the villas of Cicero, Sulla, Lucullus, Rufinus, and other illustrious Romans, who sought refuge here occasionally, from their toils, in the bosom of a soft and luxurious repose.From the midst of delightful bowers, refreshed by the pure mountain breeze, the eye looks over a romantic landscape full of poetical and historical associations.The Albanian mountains, Tivoli, once the favorite residence of Horace and Maecenas; the vast deserted Campagna with the Tiber running through it, and St. Peter’s dome swelling in the midst, the monument—as it were, over the grave of ancient Rome."
"我帮助公爵对他附近的著名遗迹进行了勘察和研究。他付出的努力得到了丰厚的回报。我们发掘出许多绝妙的塑像残片、精美的雕刻碎片，以及其他极富品味和奢华质感的石碑，这些都曾是古代图斯库鲁住宅中必备的摆设。他的别墅和庭院中堆满了从地下挖掘出来的塑像、浮雕、花瓶以及石棺。","I assisted the prince in the researches he was making among the classic ruins of his vicinity.His exertions were highly successful.Many wrecks of admirable statues and fragments of exquisite sculpture were dug up; monuments of the taste and magnificence that reigned in the ancient Tusculan abodes.He had studded his villa and its grounds with statues, relievos, vases, and sarcophagi; thus retrieved from the bosom of the earth."
"居住在别墅中的人们崇尚的生活方式令人惬意宁静而快乐，且富有情趣的工作以及悠然自得的闲暇，都让生活更加丰富多彩。每个人都随心所欲地享受着生活。日落时分，我们齐聚在晚宴上，倍感愉悦。记得那是十一月四日，美丽而恬静的一天。晚餐的第一声钟响起时，我们都齐聚在大厅里。唯有公爵的告解神甫迟迟没有出现，这让大家感到很奇怪。久等未果之后，大家便都围坐在餐桌旁。起初，大家以为他没有及时出现是因为他延长了通常的散步时间。晚餐的时间悄然滑过，大家也没有感到一丝不安或忧虑。但是，当甜点都端上桌了，还不见他的身影，大家就开始着急起来。大家担心他可能在林中的小路上突然病倒了，或是可能已落入强盗之手。隔着一条小山谷的便是高高的阿布鲁齐山，而那就是强盗的巢穴。的确，一段时间以来，周边的人们饱受他们的侵扰。臭名昭著的巴伯纳是那帮强盗的首领，人们曾看到他在图斯库鲁的偏僻地带活动。那帮强盗胆大包天的行径是出了名的。那些他们想要猎取或报复的对象，即使躲在宫殿里也并不安全。而他们对公爵的财产觊觎已久，但一想到周边有这样可怕的歹徒在附近一带徘徊潜行，就足以让人心惊胆战了。","The mode of life pursued at the villa was delightfully serene, diversified by interesting occupations and elegant leisure.Every one passed the day according to his pleasure or occupation; and we all assembled in a cheerful dinner party at sunset.It was on the fourth of November, a beautiful serene day, that we had assembled in the saloon at the sound of the first dinner-bell.The family were surprised at the absence of the prince’s confessor.They waited for him in vain, and at length placed themselves at table.They first attributed his absence to his having prolonged his customary walk; and the first part of the dinner passed without any uneasiness.When the dessert was served, however, without his making his appearance, they began to feel anxious.They feared he might have been taken ill in some alley of the woods; or, that he might have fallen into the hands of robbers.At the interval of a small valley rose the mountains of the Abruzzi, the strong-hold of banditti.Indeed, the neighborhood had, for some time, been infested by them; and Barbone, a notorious bandit chief, had often been met prowling about the solitudes of Tusculum.The daring enterprises of these ruffians were well known; the objects of their cupidity or vengeance were insecure even in palaces.As yet they had respected the possessions of the prince; but the idea of such dangerous spirits hovering about the neighbourhood was sufficient to occasion alarm."
"随着夜幕的降临，大家越发担忧起来。公爵命令护林员和家仆打着火把去寻找神甫。他们离开刚一会儿，就从底楼的走廊上传来了轻微的响动。一家人正在二楼吃饭，留下的仆人也忙于服侍。这时，底楼除了管家、洗衣女工，以及正一边休息一边与女工闲聊的三个田间雇工以外，别无他人。","The fears of the company increased as evening closed in.The prince ordered out forest guards, and domestics with flambeaux to search for the confessor.They had not departed long, when a slight noise was heard in the corridor of the ground floor.The family were dining on the first floor, and the remaining domestics were occupied in attendance.There was no one on the ground floor at this moment but the house keeper, the laundress, and three field laborers, who were resting themselves, and conversing with the women."
"我听到了下面的声响，便以为是外出未归的神甫终于回来了，就起身离开饭桌，急忙下楼，想着尽早得到消息，免得那公爵夫妇再担忧。我的脚还没有踏上最后一个台阶，我就看到有个衣着酷似强盗的人，手里握着一支卡宾枪，腰带上还别着一把匕首和几支手枪。他脸上的神情，凶残但还有些惊惶。他立刻就朝我跳过来，欣喜若狂地叫喊：“那公爵在这里！”顿时，我就明白自己已经落入贼手。但我得尽力保持冷静，不能心慌意乱。我朝走廊较低的一端瞥了一眼，看到还有几个强盗在那里。抓着我的那个强盗和其他的同伙穿着同样的衣服，佩带着同样的武器。他们看守着那两个女人和三个田间雇工。那个歹徒紧紧地抓着我的衣领，反复追问我到底是不是公爵本人。很明显，他的目标是要劫持公爵，然后勒索大笔赎金。对于我含糊其辞的回答，他大为恼火。因为我感到了误导他的重要性。","I heard the noise from below, and presuming it to be occasioned by the return of the absentee, I left the table, and hastened down stairs, eager to gain intelligence that might relieve the anxiety of the prince and princess.I had scarcely reached the last step, when I beheld before me a man dressed as a bandit; a carbine in his hand, and a stiletto and pistols in his belt.His countenance had a mingled expression of ferocity and trepidation.He sprang upon me, and exclaimed exultingly, “Ecco il principe!”I saw at once into what hands I had fallen, but endeavored to summon up coolness and presence of mind.A glance towards the lower end of the corridor showed me several ruffians, clothed and armed in the same manner with the one who had seized me.They were guarding the two females and the field laborers.The robber, who held me firmly by the collar, demanded repeatedly whether or not I were the prince.His object evidently was to carry off the prince, and extort an immense ransom.He was enraged at receiving none but vague replies; for I felt the importance of misleading him."
"突然，我想到一个办法，或许能使我摆脱他的挟持。的确，我是赤手空拳，但我身强力壮。他和他的同伙又有一段距离相隔。我猛地一用力甩脱他，接着就朝楼上跑去，不管怎样他是绝不敢孤身一人追我上楼的。一拿定主意，我就立刻行动了。我用右手一下子就扼住了歹徒的那毫无遮挡的脖子，同时用左手去抓他那握手枪的手臂。我这出乎意料的行动让歹徒措手不及。我紧紧勒着他的脖子，使他呼吸困难，全身瘫软无力。他透不上气来，脚底下也踉跄不稳。我感觉到他抓着我的手逐渐松开了，就在我即将挣脱，并准备冲上楼梯，而他还有没回过神儿的时候，突然有人从背后抓住了我。","A sudden thought struck me how I might extricate myself from his clutches.I was unarmed, it is true, but I was vigorous.His companions were at a distance.By a sudden exertion I might wrest myself from him and spring up the staircase, whither he would not dare to follow me singly.The idea was put in execution as soon as conceived.The ruffian’s throat was bare: with my right hand I seized him by it, just between the mastoides; with my left hand I grasped the arm which held the carbine.The suddenness of my attack took him completely unawares; and the strangling nature of my grasp paralyzed him.He choked and faltered.I felt his hand relaxing its hold, and was on the point of jerking myself away and darting up the staircase before he could recover himself, when I was suddenly seized by some one from behind."
"我不得不松开了紧扼的手。那强盗一脱开身，就猛烈攻击我，还用枪托砸了我几下，其中一击砸在我的前额上，顿时血淌了一身。他趁我被打得头晕目眩之际，抢走了我的手表，而身上其他值钱的东西也被洗劫一空。","I had to let go my grasp.The bandit, once more released, fell upon me with fury, and gave me several blows with the butt end of his carbine, one of which wounded me severely in the forehead, and covered me with blood.He took advantage of my being stunned to rifle me of my watch and whatever valuables I had about my person."
"等我挨打后清醒过来，我听到那强盗头儿大喊着：“这就是那公爵，行了，我们走。”（这就是公爵，行了，我们走。）那帮强盗立刻朝我围拢过来，并将我拖出宅邸，同样地那三个雇工也难以幸免。","When I recovered from the effects of the blow, I heard the voice of the chief of the banditti, who exclaimed “Quello e il principe, siamo contente, audiamo!”(It is the prince, enough, let us be off.)The band immediately closed round me and dragged me out of the palace, bearing off the three laborers likewise."
"我没带帽子，伤口血流不止，但是我好不容易才用手帕扎在额头上将血止住。那强盗首领带着我凯旋而归，还以为我就是他们要的公爵。我们走出去好远，他才从一个雇工嘴里得知抓错人了。他气得火冒三丈。可是，要再返回别墅，力图挽回自己的过错，恐怕为时已晚，因为警报一定已经发出，人人都手握武器，严阵以待了。他凶恶地瞪了我一眼，骂我欺骗了他，让他痛失了发财的机会，还告诉我准备受死吧。其余的歹徒也个个怒不可遏。我注意到他们的手都放在匕首上；我知道，对于这帮穷凶极恶的强盗来说死亡绝不是虚张声势的恫吓。雇工们看到他们的话陷我于生死之间，便急忙向歹徒的头子保证，说公爵愿意出一大笔赎金来赎我。这句话带来了些许的平静。对我而言，我不能说他们的威胁并没有让我惊慌绝望。这倒不是吹嘘我有多英勇无畏。只是之前的几场革命活动让我在磨难中备受洗礼；在不尽的危险和灾难中，亲历了死亡的擦肩而过，使我对威胁恐惧慢慢习惯了。   人要是在生活中频频遭遇危险，就会最终变得漠然生死，恰似赌徒嗜赌如命，枉费钱财一样。尽管面临暴徒的生死威胁，我还是喝道：“你们趁早些，给我个痛快！”我这样的言语让歹徒的头儿很是吃惊，而雇工们所说的赎金，无疑给了他莫大的影响。他考虑了一会儿，强作镇静，便向那些时刻准备着将我处死的同伙打了个手势。“走！”他说，“这事以后再说。”","I had no hat on, and the blood was flowing from my wound; I managed to staunch it, however, with my pocket-handkerchief, which I bound round my forehead.The captain of the band conducted me in triumph, supposing me to be the prince.We had gone some distance before he learnt his mistake from one of the laborers.His rage was terrible.It was too late to return to the villa and endeavor to retrieve his error, for by this time the alarm must have been given, and every one in arms.He darted at me a furious look; swore I had deceived him, and caused him to miss his fortune; and told me to prepare for death.The rest of the robbers were equally furious.I saw their hands upon their poinards; and I knew that death was seldom an empty menace with these ruffians.The laborers saw the peril into which their information had betrayed me, and eagerly assured the captain that I was a man for whom the prince would pay a great ransom.This produced a pause.For my part, I cannot say that I had been much dismayed by their menaces.I mean not to make any boast of courage; but I have been so schooled to hardship during the late revolutions, and have beheld death around me in so many perilous and disastrous scenes that I have become, in some measure callous to its terrors.The frequent hazard of life makes a man at length as reckless of it as a gambler of his money.To their threat of death, I replied: “That the sooner it was executed, the better.”This reply seemed to astonish the captain, and the prospect of ransom held out by the laborers, had, no doubt, a still greater effect on him.He considered for a moment; assumed a calmer manner, and made a sign to his companions, who had remained waiting for my death warrant.“Forward,” said he, “we will see about this matter by and bye.”"
"我们迅速朝通往罗卡·庇奥利的拉莫拉络大路奔去。在这条路的半途中有家旅馆，但这里却人迹罕至。强盗头儿命令大伙在距离旅馆射程之内的位置停下来，然后便是死一般的寂静。然后他独自一人，悄悄地朝大门口走去。他仔细检查了门外的状况后，然后急忙跑回来，打了个手势，叫他的同伙跟他悄悄前进。后来才知道，那是强盗们众多的隐蔽藏身之所之一。那旅店的老板与强盗头儿很是熟识，而且很有可能他同别的贼首也来往甚密。要是旅店里有巡逻队或是宪兵的人，老板就会用预先安在门上的装置向强盗们发出暗号。假如没有，他们就能安全进入，并被待如上宾。许多位于罗马版图上荒野之地、人迹罕至的旅馆，尤其是那些山区边缘的，同样都似乎与强盗有来往，甚是危险。这些旅馆是强盗们收集信息、协调行动的地方，也是粗心的路人因偏僻险远而难以呼救求援，最后丧命于夜半歹徒刀下的地方。","We descended rapidly towards the road of la Molara, which leads to Rocca Priori.In the midst of this road is a solitary inn.The captain ordered the troop to halt at the distance of a pistol shot from it; and enjoined profound silence.He then approached the threshold alone with noiseless steps.He examined the outside of the door very narrowly, and then returning precipitately, made a sign for the troop to continue its march in silence.It has since been ascertained that this was one of those infamous inns which are the secret resorts of banditti.The innkeeper had an understanding with the captain, as he most probably had with the chiefs of the different bands.When any of the patroles and gens d’armes were quartered at his house, the brigands were warned of it by a preconcerted signal on the door; when there was no such signal, they might enter with safety and be sure of welcome.Many an isolated inn among the lonely parts of the Roman territories, and especially on the skirts of the mountains, have the same dangerous and suspicious character.They are places where the banditti gather information; where they concert their plans, and where the unwary traveller, remote from hearing or assistance, is sometimes betrayed to the stiletto of the midnight murderer."
"继续前行了一段后，我们就离开主路向群山密林环绕的罗卡·庇奥利走去。路途曲折蜿蜒，艰难而漫长，最后我们爬上了一个隐蔽在密林中的陡坡。走到坡中心时，他们叫我坐在地上。我刚坐下，他们的头儿一个手势，强盗们就将我团团围住，同时拉扯着几个大斗篷支撑起一个大帐篷，同伙们的身体恰似帐篷的支柱。强盗头儿点起火，然后就引燃了火炬。同伙们拉扯着斗篷来遮蔽火炬的光亮以免被人发现。我被完全遮挡在黑蒙蒙的斗篷下，无法看清周围的事物而对自己的处境担忧起来。在火炬的映衬下，我看到强盗们穿着的各色内衣，烁烁发光的武器，一张张粗糙坚韧的脸庞。面对这样的场景，我却无法静心欣赏。一切发展似乎都太戏剧性了。","After pursuing our road a little farther, we struck off towards the Woody mountains which envelope Rocca Priori.Our march was long and painful, with many circuits and windings; at length we clambered a steep ascent, covered with a thick forest, and when we had reached the centre, I was told to seat myself on the earth.No sooner had I done so, than at a sign from their chief, the robbers surrounded me, and spreading their great cloaks from one to the other, formed a kind of pavilion of mantles, to which their bodies might be said to seem as columns.The captain then struck a light, and a flambeau was lit immediately.The mantles were extended to prevent the light of the flambeau from being seen through the forest.Anxious as was my situation, I could not look round upon this screen of dusky drapery, relieved by the bright colors of the robbers’ under-dresses, the gleaming of their weapons, and the variety of strong-marked countenances, lit up by the flambeau, without admiring the picturesque effect of the scene.It was quite theatrical."
"强盗手里拿着一个角状的墨水瓶，递给我纸和笔，命令我记录下他口述的内容。我听命而行。这是封勒索信。蛮横无理的言辞表达了要求，“要赎回我，公爵得送来三千美金；倘若不答应，那我就必死无疑了。”","The captain now held an ink-horn, and giving me pen and paper, ordered me to write what he should dictate.I obeyed.It was a demand, couched in the style of robber eloquence, “that the prince should send three thousand dollars for my ransom, or that my death should be the consequence of a refusal.”"
"我很了解这帮亡命之徒，很清楚这可不是虚张声势的恐吓威胁。强盗们通过让对方感觉到，假如要求未果，他们一定会撕票，这样他们的勒索才能奏效。然而，我立刻就看出这个要求十分荒谬，另外，言辞也不恰当。","I knew enough of the desperate character of these beings to feel assured this was not an idle menace.Their only mode of insuring attention to their demands, is to make the infliction of the penalty inevitable.I saw at once, however, that the demand was preposterous, and made in improper language."
"我把这些告诉强盗头子，并使他相信，我既不是公爵的朋友，也不是他的亲戚，而只是个雇来的画家，所以勒索这么大一笔钱肯定是不可能的。我除了会画画以外，别无他物可以作为赎金。如果这些还不能满足他们，那我是生是死就随便他们处置了，因为我并没有把生命看得很重。","I told the captain so, and assured him, that so extravagant a sum would never be granted; that I was neither friend or relative of the prince, but a mere artist, employed to execute certain paintings.That I had nothing to offer as a ransom but the price of my labors; if this were not sufficient, my life was at their disposal: it was a thing on which I sat but little value."
"我的话变得更加强硬，因为我看到我的镇静和坚强对强盗们起作用了。的确如此，当我讲完这些时，强盗头儿欲伸手去抓匕首，但他还是克制住了，然后一把夺过信，叠好了，专横地命令我写上公爵亲收。然后他派一个雇工将信送往图斯库鲁，雇工承诺尽快返回。","I was the more hardy in my reply, because I saw that coolness and hardihood had an effect upon the robbers.It is true, as I finished speaking the captain laid his hand upon his stiletto, but he restrained himself, and snatching the letter, folded it, and ordered me, in a peremptory tone, to address it to the prince.He then despatched one of the laborers with it to Tusculum, who promised to return with all possible speed."
"现在强盗们准备睡觉了，并命令我也睡。他们将几件大斗篷铺展在地上，然后躺在我周围就睡了。有一个强盗在稍远的地方放哨，每隔两小时会换一班岗。露宿在陌生荒芜的群山中，身边是一帮无法无天、手不离枪的强盗，生命在他们眼中真是微不足道，这些足以让我毫无睡意。更何况，冷冰冰的地面以及寒气袭人的露水比精神上的折磨让人更煎熬，使我难以入眠。随着夜色逐渐凝重，从遥远的地中海飘进群山的湿气，让我倍感寒冷。我得想个脱身之法。我轻唤一个同我一起被困的雇工，让他躺在我身边。每当我四肢冰凉时，我就挨向那个雇工强壮的身躯，以获取些温暖。这样，我才睡了片刻。","The robbers now prepared themselves for sleep, and I was told that I might do the same.They spread their great cloaks on the ground, and lay down around me.One was stationed at a little distance to keep watch, and was relieved every two hours.The strangeness and wildness of this mountain bivouac, among lawless beings whose hands seemed ever ready to grasp the stiletto, and with whom life was so trivial and insecure, was enough to banish repose.The coldness of the earth and of the dew, however, had a still greater effect than mental causes in disturbing my rest.The airs wafted to these mountains from the distant Mediterranean diffused a great chilliness as the night advanced.An expedient suggested itself.I called one of my fellow prisoners, the laborers, and made him lie down beside me.Whenever one of my limbs became chilled I approached it to the robust limb of my neighbor, and borrowed some of his warmth.In this way I was able to obtain a little sleep."
"终于，天光放亮，我被强盗头儿的喊叫从睡梦中惊醒。他要我起来，跟他走。我顺从了。我仔细端详着他的脸，那脸色似乎缓和了些。他甚至还伸手扶我走过岩石和荆棘遍布的险峻森林地带。久居山间使他在此健步如飞、如履平地，但我却觉得这些蜿蜒崎岖的山路甚是难行。最后，我们爬上了山顶。","Day at length dawned, and I was roused from my slumber by the voice of the chieftain.He desired me to rise and follow him.I obeyed.On considering his physiognomy attentively, it appeared a little softened.He even assisted me in scrambling up the steep forest among rocks and brambles.Habit had made him a vigorous mountaineer; but I found it excessively toilsome to climb those rugged heights.We arrived at length at the summit of the mountain."
"站在高山之巅，我觉得自己的绘画热情一下子被唤醒了。望着黎明的太阳在阿布鲁齐群山中冉冉升起的壮观景色，我居然一时忘记了自己还身陷险境，疲惫不堪。正是在这些山顶上，汉尼巴尔首先扎下营盘，向他的同伙比划着罗马的版图界限。眼前是望不到边的辽阔疆土。俯瞰下去，群山林立，海拔较低的是图斯库鲁的村庄以及庄严神圣的历史遗迹；萨拜因山和阿尔巴尼山分列左右两侧，绵延不绝。与图库斯鲁和弗拉斯卡蒂远远相隔的是辽阔的坎巴克纳，那里有成排的墓穴，一条散乱地横穿坎巴克纳而过的残缺的水渠，中间还有“永恒之城”的塔楼和穹顶。","Here it was that I felt all the enthusiasm of my art suddenly awakened; and I forgot, in an instant, all perils and fatigues at this magnificent view of the sunrise in the midst of the mountains of Abruzzi.It was on these heights that Hannibal first pitched his camp, and pointed out Rome to his followers.The eye embraces a vast extent of country.The minor height of Tusculum, with its villas, and its sacred ruins, lie below; the Sabine hills and the Albanian mountains stretch on either hand, and beyond Tusculum and Frescati spreads out the immense Campagna, with its line of tombs, and here and there a broken aqueduct stretching across it, and the towers and domes of the eternal city in the midst."
"我在阿布鲁齐雄伟壮观的密林中极目远眺，只看到那眼前的景致在冉冉升起的太阳光辉映衬下，甚是绝美动人。再设想一下，眼前本就是一片荒凉之地，再加上那帮手持武器，穿着蛮野，行为怪异的强盗，此地就更加荒芜粗野了。突然，我胸中思绪情感万千，激情甚烈，这样的变化似乎并不会让人感到奇怪。","Fancy this scene lit up by the glories of a rising sun, and bursting upon my sight, as I looked forth from among the majestic forests of the Abruzzi.Fancy, too, the savage foreground, made still more savage by groups of the banditti, armed and dressed in their wild, picturesque manner, and you will not wonder that the enthusiasm of a painter for a moment overpowered all his other feelings."
"强盗们了然于心且在他们看来如此平淡无奇的景致竟然让我赞叹不已，这使他们都感到十分惊讶。我趁他们在这里休息的空当，拿出一叠画纸，开始用素描记录下眼前这别样的风光。我所处的山丘荒凉偏僻，与图斯库鲁山脉隔着一个近三英里宽的谷地。但是这里的空气清新、洁净，三英里的距离看上去也不是很远。这个山丘既能俯瞰整个地区，又有森林覆盖，隐蔽且远离人迹，所以是强盗们最钟爱的藏身处之一。","The banditti were astonished at my admiration of a scene which familiarity had made so common in their eyes.I took advantage of their halting at this spot, drew forth a quire of drawing-paper, and began to sketch the features of the landscape.The height, on which I was seated, was wild and solitary, separated from the ridge of Tusculum by a valley nearly three miles wide; though the distance appeared less from the purity of the atmosphere.This height was one of the favorite retreats of the banditti, commanding a look-out over the country; while, at the same time, it was covered with forests, and distant from the populous haunts of men."
"我尽心做素描时，鸟儿和绵羊的叫声吸引了我的注意力。我四下望去，却不见它们的身影。叫声再度响起，似乎是从树顶上传来的。我仔细一看，只见六个强盗栖身在橡树的树梢上，这些橡树生长在山顶上，通风良好，山下即是徐徐展开的景致，连绵不断。强盗像秃鹰似的静静蹲在树上，他们在瞭望放哨，眼睛不停地观察着山下的深谷，相互用手势或模仿老鹰、乌鸦或山兽的叫声通报信息，这样就不至于引起路人的警觉。经过侦查周围的情况，确认别无异常之后，他们相互发出信号便从树上下来，继续看管那几个俘虏。强盗头儿派了三个同伙在三面寸草不生的山坡上放哨，而他自己，以及那些他最信任的伙伴都呆在原地。","While I was sketching, my attention was called off for a moment by the cries of birds and the bleatings of sheep.I looked around, but could see nothing of the animals that uttered them.They were repeated, and appeared to come from the summits of the trees.On looking more narrowly, I perceived six of the robbers perched on the tops of oaks, which grew on the breezy crest of the mountain, and commanded an uninterrupted prospect.From hence they were keeping a look-out, like so many vultures; casting their eyes into the depths of the valley below us; communicating; with each other by signs, or holding discourse in sounds, which might be mistaken by the wayfarer for the cries of hawks and crows, or the bleating of the mountain flocks.After they had reconnoitred the neighborhood, and finished their singular discourse, they descended from their airy perch, and returned to their prisoners.The captain posted three of them at three naked sides of the mountain, while he remained to guard us with what appeared his most trusty companion."
"他想看看我手里握着的画本，浏览一番过后，他深信我说的是实话，即我就是画家。我觉得，我看到他流露出了一丝好感，心里就暗暗决定，这个变化可不能错过，要好好利用才是。我知道，只要细细观察分析，即使是十恶不赦之徒也有优点和可交往之处。的确，在这个意大利强盗身上就有这样的特质。虽然生性鲁莽凶残，但他有时也会流露出些许友善和幽默。一些并无预谋的犯罪终于使他踏上这样的不归之路，但他并不总是暴虐无度，或许意大利人生来就有这样的性格，喜怒难测。这样，他被迫占山为王，或依照他们的行话，称作“坎帕格纳的守护者”。他靠抢劫为生；但像士兵一样，不打仗时就卸甲归田，与常人别无他样。","I had my book of sketches in my hand; he requested to see it, and after having run his eye over it, expressed himself convinced of the truth of my assertion, that I was a painter.I thought I saw a gleam of good feeling dawning in him, and determined to avail myself of it.I knew that the worst of men have their good points and their accessible sides, if one would but study them carefully.Indeed, there is a singular mixture in the character of the Italian robber.With reckless ferocity, he often mingles traits of kindness and good humor.He is often not radically bad, but driven to his course of life by some unpremeditated crime, the effect of those sudden bursts of passion to which the Italian temperament is prone.This has compelled him to take to the mountains, or, as it is technically termed among them, “andare in Campagna.”He has become a robber by profession; but like a soldier, when not in action, he can lay aside his weapon and his fierceness, and become like other men."
"强盗头儿在细细打量我的画作时，我有意同他攀谈起来。我发现他其实很喜欢与人交流，也很健谈。慢慢地，看到他时，我不会感到什么拘谨慌乱了。似乎，我看到他也很自爱自重，就决定好好利用他这个特点。我装出一副漫不经心的态度，告诉他，作为艺术家，我会给人看相，并从他的相貌和举止上，我看出了些许名堂，这或许能给带来他意外之财。我还说，他并不是生来就适合干这样放任自流行当的人；他的天赋和才干适于更体面的工作；他需要调整自己的生活方向才行。让他现在横行妄为、不畏生死，并在匪界闻名的勇气和才能，假若用来从事合法的职业，必能使他博得社会的称赞和赏识。","I took occasion from the observations of the captain on my sketchings, to fall into conversation with him.I found him sociable and communicative.By degrees I became completely at my ease with him.I had fancied I perceived about him a degree of self-love, which I determined to make use of.I assumed an air of careless frankness, and told him that, as artist, I pretended to the power of judging of the physiognomy; that I thought I perceived something in his features and demeanor which announced him worthy of higher fortunes.That he was not formed to exercise the profession to which he had abandoned himself; that he had talents and qualities fitted for a nobler sphere of action; that he had but to change his course of life, and in a legitimate career, the same courage and endowments which now made him an object of terror, would ensure him the applause and admiration of society."
"我从不会看错人。我的一席话触动了他，他激动起来。他紧紧抓起我的手，情绪激昂地说：“你真猜对了，你真是会看人。”他沉默了一会儿，思忖着又说：“告诉你些我生活中的特殊经历，那样你就会明白，我占山为王是出于万般无奈，并非是我为非作歹啊。我尽心竭力为同胞做事，但他们却迫害我，使我背井离乡。”我们坐在草地上，那个强盗向我讲述了下面这个他生活中的故事。","I had not mistaken my man.My discourse both touched and excited him.He seized my hand, pressed it, and replied with strong emotion, “You have guessed the truth; you have judged me rightly.”He remained for a moment silent; then with a kind of effort he resumed.“I will tell you some particulars of my life, and you will perceive that it was the oppression of others, rather than my own crimes, that drove me to the mountains.I sought to serve my fellow-men, and they have persecuted me from among them.”We seated ourselves on the grass, and the robber gave me the following anecdotes of his history."
