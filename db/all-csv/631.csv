"福尔摩斯仔仔细细地读完了上一班邮差送来的一封短柬，跟着就把它扔给了我，同时还无声无息地干笑了一下，在他而言，这已经是最接近于哑然失笑的举动了。","Holmes had read carefully a note which the last post had brought him. Then, with the dry chuckle which was his nearest approach to a laugh, he tossed it over to me."
"“按我看，作为现代气息与中古风貌、务实精神与荒唐异想的混合体，这封短柬真可谓登峰造极。”他说道。“你怎么看呢，华生？”","“For a mixture of the modern and the mediaeval, of the practical and of the wildlyfanciful, I think this is surely the limit,” said he. “What do you make of it, Watson?”"
"这封短柬内容如下：","I read as follows:"
"> 事由：吸血鬼","46, Old Jewry,"
"> 敬启者：","Nov. 19th."
"> 敏星巷弗格森-缪尔黑德茶行之罗伯特·弗格森先生为敝行主顾，是日曾向敝行垂询吸血鬼事宜。敝行专业为机械估价，经营事项之中并无此等名目，有鉴于此，敝行已介绍弗格森先生前往贵处求教。尊驾曾成功侦办玛蒂尔达·布里格斯一案，敝行至今铭感。","Re Vampires"

"> E.J.C 执笔","> Our client, Mr. Robert Ferguson, of Ferguson and Muirhead, tea brokers, of Mincing Lane, has made some inquiry from us in a communication of even date concerning vampires. As our firm specializes entirely upon the assessment of machinery the matter hardly comes within our purview, and we have therefore recommended Mr. Ferguson to call upon you and lay the matter before you. We have not forgotten your successful action in the case of Matilda Briggs."

"> 老犹太街46号","> per E. J. C."
"“华生啊，‘玛蒂尔达·布里格斯’可不是什么妙龄女子。”福尔摩斯的声音浸透了往事的回忆。“那是一艘船，跟苏门答腊巨鼠有关，那件案子还没到可以公之于世的时候。可是，咱们对吸血鬼又有多少了解呢？这能算是咱们的经营事项吗？管他呢，有事做总比闲着好，话说回来，咱们真的有点儿像是突然走进了格林童话哩。麻烦你伸伸胳膊，华生，让我瞧瞧‘V’ 萨字头下面有些什么东西[^1]。”","“Matilda Briggs was not the name of a young woman, Watson,” said Holmes in a reminiscent voice. “It was a ship which is associated with the giant rat of Sumatra, a story for which the world is not yet prepared. But what do we know about vampires? Does it come within our purview either? Anything is better than stagnation, but really we seem to have been switched on to a Grimms’ fairy tale. Make a long arm, Watson, and see what V has to say.”"
"我往后一仰，把他说的那本大部头索引拿了下来。索引里有他那些旧案的记录，还有他用毕生精力搜集来的各种资料。福尔摩斯把索引搁在膝上，饱含深情地慢慢浏览着那些条目。","I leaned back and took down the great index volume to which he referred. Holmes balanced it on his knee, and his eyes moved slowly and lovingly over the record of old cases, mixed with the accumulated information of a lifetime."
"“‘苏格兰之星号’航行记录[^2]，”他念道。“那件事情真是糟透了。华生，我还记得你把它写成了故事，只可惜我对你那篇作品不敢恭维。维克托·林奇，货币伪造犯。带毒蜥蜴，又名大毒蜥。要我说，那可真是件不寻常的案子！维托利亚，马戏团女演员。范德比尔特和金库窃匪。蝰蛇。维戈尔，哈默史密斯街区的非凡人物。嘿！嘿！好一本索引，简直是无与伦比。听听这个，华生，匈牙利的吸血鬼迷信。接下来还有呢，兰西瓦尼亚的吸血鬼[^3]。”他兴冲冲地继续往下翻，不过，他只是聚精会神地研读了一小会儿，跟着就大失所望地咆哮一声，扔下了那本大部头。","“Voyage of the Gloria Scott,” he read. “That was a bad business. I have some recollection that you made a record of it, Watson, though I was unable to congratulate you upon the result. Victor Lynch, the forger. Venomous lizard or gila. Remarkable case, that! Vittoria, the circus belle. Vanderbilt and the Yeggman. Vipers. Vigor, the Hammersmith wonder. Hullo! Hullo! Good old index. You can’t beat it. Listen to this, Watson. Vampirism in Hungary . And again, Vampires in T ransylvania.” He turned over the pages with eagerness, but after a short intent perusal he threw down the great book with a snarl of disappointment."
"“胡扯，华生，全是胡扯！据说，要想让那些行尸走肉老老实实地待在坟墓里，唯一的办法就是把尖桩钉进他们的心脏，这种货色跟咱们能有什么关系呢？这纯粹是疯子的胡言乱语嘛。”","“Rubbish, Watson, rubbish! What have we to do with walking corpses who can only be held in their grave by stakes driven through their hearts? It’s pure lunacy.”"
"“不过，”我说道，“吸血鬼并不一定都是死人，对吧？活人也有可能沾上吸血的习性。举个例子说吧，我曾经读到过一些记载，说有些老人会去吸年青人的血，靠这个来留住青春。”","“But surely,” said I, “the vampire was not necessarily a dead man? A living person might have the habit. I have read, for example, of the old sucking the blood of the young in order to retain their youth.”"
"“你说得对，华生。我这本索引也提到了这个传说。可是，这样的事情能当真吗？我这家侦探社[^4]稳稳当当地立在地面上，后也不会飞到天上去。对咱们来说，现实的世界就已经够大的了，用不着添上什么鬼魂。依我看，咱们可不能把罗伯特·弗格森先生的话太当回事。这儿还有一封信，说不定就是他写来的，可以让咱们知道他究竟在担心什么。”","“You are right, Watson. It mentions the legend in one of these references. But are we to give serious attention to such things? This agency stands flat footed upon the ground, and there it must remain. The world is big enough for us. No ghosts need apply. I fear that we cannot take Mr. Robert Ferguson very seriously. Possibly this note may be from him and may throw some light upon what is worrying him.”"
"之前他光顾着研究前面所说的那封短柬，没有理会摆在桌上的另一封信，到这会儿才把它拿了起来。刚开始读的时候，他脸上带着兴致盎然的笑容，读着读着，他的笑容渐渐褪去，取而代之的是一种紧张专注的神情。读完之后，他坐在那里沉思了一小会儿，夹在指间的信纸晃来晃去。接下来，他猛一激灵，回过了神。","He took up a second letter which had lain unnoticed upon the table while he had been absorbed with the first. This he began to read with a smile of amusement upon his face which gradually faded away into an expression of intense interest and concentration. When he had finished he sat for some little time lost in thought with the letter dangling from his fingers. Finally, with a start, he aroused himself from his reverie."
"“兰伯里的奇斯曼宅邸。兰伯里在什么地方呢，华生？”","“Cheeseman’s, Lamberley. Where is Lamberley, Watson?”"
"“在萨塞克斯郡，霍舍姆的南边[^5]。”","“It is in Sussex, south of Horsham.”"
"“不算太远，对吧？奇斯曼宅邸又是怎么回事呢？”","“Not very far, eh? And Cheeseman’s?”"
"“那一带我很熟悉，福尔摩斯。那边有很多几百年前建造的老宅，宅子的名字都是建房者的姓氏，比如奥德利宅邸、哈维宅邸、卡里顿宅邸——建宅子的人早已湮没，姓氏却借着宅子传了下来。”","“I know that country, Holmes. It is full of old houses which are named after the men who built them centuries ago. You get Odley’s and Harvey’s and Carriton’s—the folk are forgotten but their names live in their houses.”"
"“的确如此。”福尔摩斯不咸不淡地说道。他骄傲内敛的天性之中包含着一个特异之处，也就是说，他会不声不响地把新的知识变成脑子里的精确记忆，但却很少会向知识的提供者表示任何谢意。“按我看，事情结束之前，咱们对奇斯曼宅邸的了解肯定会比现在多得多。不出我的预料，这封信确实是罗伯特·弗格森写来的。对了，他还说他认识你呢。”","“Precisely ,” said Holmes coldly. It was one of the peculiarities of his proud, self-contained nature that though he docketed any fresh information very quietly and accurately in his brain, he seldom made any acknowledgment to the giver. “I rather fancy we shall know a good deal more about Cheeseman’s, Lamberley, before we are through. The letter is, as I had hoped, from Robert Ferguson. By the way, he claims acquaintance with you.”"
"“认识我！”","“With me!”"
"“你自己读一读吧。”","“You had better read it.”"
"他把信递给了我，抬头的地址如前所述。信中写道：","He handed the letter across. It was headed with the address quoted."
"> 亲爱的福尔摩斯先生：","> Dear Mr. Holmes [it said]:"
"> 我的律师建议我向您请教，不过，这件事情实在是极其敏感，简直让人难于启齿。事情牵涉到我的一个朋友，我是代表他来跟您联系的。大概五年之前，这位先生娶了一位秘鲁商人的女儿，他跟这位商人的交情是通过进口硝酸盐业务建立起来的。他的妻子非常美丽，只可惜出身异国，信的又是异教，以致夫妻之间总是有点儿志趣不合。这样一来，一段时间之后，他兴许已经不再像以前那样深爱他的妻子，兴许还觉得这场婚姻是个错误。按他的感觉，妻子的性情之中包含着一些他永远无法触及、永远无法理解的因素。这样的局面格外让人痛苦，因为她是个再痴心不过的好妻子，从各方面来看都对丈夫死心塌地。","> I have been recommended to you by my lawyers, but indeed the matter is so extraordinarily delicate that it is most difficult to discuss. It concerns a friend for whom I am acting. This gentleman married some five years ago a Peruvian lady, the daughter of a Peruvian merchant, whom he had met in connection with the importation of nitrates. The lady was very beautiful, but the fact of her foreign birth and of her alien religion always caused a separation of interests and of feelings between husband and wife, so that after a time his love may have cooled towards her and he may have come to regard their union as a mistake. He felt there were sides of her character which he could never explore or understand. This was the more painful as she was as loving a wife as a man could have—to all appearance absolutely devoted."
"> 接下来我打算讲一讲大致的情况，详情可以等我们见面的时候再谈。说实在的，这封信只是想让您对事态有一个整体的了解，同时也想问一问您，是否愿意介入此事。他的妻子已经表现出了一些怪异的毛病，跟她平常那种温柔可爱的性情大相径庭。这位先生结了两次婚，前妻给他留下了一个儿子。这孩子已经十五岁了，非常惹人疼爱，而且非常孝顺，只可惜童年的时候遇上过一次意外，受到了严重的伤害。有人两次撞见这个做妻子的无缘无故地痛打这个可怜的孩子，有一次还用上了手杖，把孩子的胳膊打出了一道可怕的血印。","> Now for the point which I will make more plain when we meet. Indeed, this note is merely to give you a general idea of the situation and to ascertain whether you would care to interest yourself in the matter. The lady began to show some curious traits quite alien to her ordinarily sweet and gentle disposition. The gentleman had been married twice and he had one son by the first wife. This boy was now fifteen, a very charming and affectionate youth, though unhappily injured through an accident in childhood. T wice the wife was caught in the act of assaulting this poor lad in the most unprovoked way. Once she struck him with a stick and left a great weal on his arm."
"> 不过，跟她对待亲生儿子的方法相比，前面这些都只能算是小事一桩。她的儿子将近一岁，是个非常可爱的婴孩。有那么一次，时间大概是一个月之前，保姆去了别处，让这个婴孩自个儿待了几分钟。婴孩突然大声哭喊，似乎是觉得疼痛，吓得保姆赶紧跑了回去。跑进房间的时候，她发现女主人趴在婴孩身上，显然是正在咬婴孩的脖子。婴儿的脖子上有个小小的伤口，还有一道血迹。保姆惊骇万分，当时就想去叫男主人，女主人却恳求她不要这么做，还实实在在地给了她五镑封口费。女主人没作任何解释，这场风波就算是暂时平息了。","> This was a small matter, however, compared with her conduct to her own child, a dear boy just under one year of age. On one occasion about a month ago this child had been left by its nurse for a few minutes. A loud cry from the baby, as of pain, called the nurse back. As she ran into the room she saw her employer, the lady, leaning over the baby and apparently biting his neck. There was a small wound in the neck from which a stream of blood had escaped. The nurse was so horrified that she wished to call the husband, but the lady implored her not to do so and actually gave her five pounds as a price for her silence. No explanation was ever given, and for the moment the matter was passed over."
"> 不过，这件事情给保姆留下了可怕的印象，她从此就密切地留意着女主人的举动，对婴孩的看护也更加仔细，因为她很疼这个孩子。按她的感觉，她监视着孩子的母亲，孩子的母亲也在监视她，每当她被迫撇下孩子的时候，孩子的母亲总是在等着接近孩子。保姆日日夜夜地保护着孩子，这位无声无息、全神戒备的母亲也日日夜夜地守在一旁，仿佛是一头窥伺羊羔的恶狼。读到这里，您一定觉得难以置信，可我恳求您务必认真对待，因为这件事情关系到一个孩子的生死，还关系到一个男人能否保全自己的神志。","> It left, however, a terrible impression upon the nurse’s mind, and from that time she began to watch her mistress closely and to keep a closer guard upon the baby , whom she tenderly loved. It seemed to her that even as she watched the mother, so the mother watched her, and that every time she was compelled to leave the baby alone the mother was waiting to get at it. Day and night the nurse covered the child, and day and night the silent, watchful mother seemed to be lying in wait as a wolf waits for a lamb. It must read most incredible to you, and yet I beg you to take it seriously, for a child’s life and a man’s sanity may depend upon it."
"> 可怕的日子终于降临，因为保姆无法再对男主人隐瞒真相。她已经精神崩溃，再也承受不起这样的压力，于是就向男主人坦白了一切。您兴许觉得这些都是天方夜谭，他刚开始的感觉也跟您一样。他知道妻子对他情深爱重，对孩子也是呵护备至，只有殴打继子的事情是个例外。既然如此，她怎么会伤害她亲生的小宝贝呢？他斥责保姆白日做梦，说她的怀疑全都是疯子的妄想，还说她这种诽谤女主人的行为实在是让人无法容忍。话还没有说完，屋里突然响起了一声痛苦的叫喊，他就和保姆一起冲进了儿童房。他看见他妻子正从婴儿床的旁边直起身来，又看见孩子的脖子露在外面，脖子和床单上都有血迹，想想吧，福尔摩斯先生，他当时是一种怎样的感觉。男主人惊骇地大叫一声，把妻子的脸转到亮处，立刻发现妻子的嘴上沾满了鲜血。是她，绝绝对对是她，刚刚吸了这个可怜婴孩的血。","> At last there came one dreadful day when the facts could no longer be concealed from the husband. The nurse’s nerve had given way; she could stand the strain no longer, and she made a clean breast of it all to the man. To him it seemed as wild a tale as it may now seem to you. He knew his wife to be a loving wife, and, save for the assaults upon her stepson, a loving mother. Why, then, should she wound her own dear little baby? He told the nurse that she was dreaming, that her suspicions were those of a lunatic, and that such libels upon her mistress were not to be tolerated. While they were talking a sudden cry of pain was heard. Nurse and master rushed together to the nursery . Imagine his feelings, Mr. Holmes, as he saw his wife rise from a kneeling position beside the cot and saw blood upon the child’s exposed neck and upon the sheet. With a cry of horror, he turned his wife’s face to the light and saw blood all round her lips. It was she—she beyond all question—who had drunk the poor baby’s blood."
"> 他家的情况就是这样。眼下呢，做妻子的把自己关在了房间里，没有提供任何解释，做丈夫的则处于神经错乱的边缘。对于吸血鬼，他跟我都是只闻其名，本来还以为这仅仅是异国他乡的无稽之谈呢。没想到，这样的事情竟然出现在了英格兰萨塞克斯郡的心脏地带。算了，这些事情还是等明天上午见面的时候再谈吧。您愿意见我吗？愿意用您的非凡本领帮助一个六神无主的人吗？愿意的话，麻烦您发封电报到兰伯里的奇斯曼宅邸，收报人就写弗格森。收到电报之后，我会在明天上午十点钟登门求教。","> So the matter stands. She is now confined to her room. There has been no explanation. The husband is half demented. He knows, and I know , little of vampirism beyond the name. We had thought it was some wild tale of foreign parts. And yet here in the very heart of the English Sussex—well, all this can be discussed with you in the morning. Will you see me? Will you use your great powers in aiding a distracted man? If so, kindly wire to Ferguson, Cheeseman’s, Lamberley , and I will be at your rooms by ten o’clock."
"> 您忠实的朋友，","> Yours faithfully,"
"> 罗伯特·弗格森","> Robert Ferguson."
"> 又：据我所知，您的朋友华生曾经是布莱克希斯橄榄球俱乐部的队员，当时我是里奇蒙俱乐部的中卫[^6]。关于这次会面，我只有这么一点儿引见之资。","> P. S. I believe your friend Watson played Rugby for Blackheath when I was three-quarter for Richmond. It is the only personal introduction which I can give."
"“我当然记得他，”我一边说，一边把信放回了桌子上。“大块头鲍勃·弗格森[^7]可是里奇蒙俱乐部有史以来最棒的中卫呢。他这个人一向热心，像这样为朋友的事情牵肠挂肚，确实是他的作风。”","“Of course I remembered him,” said I as I laid down the letter. “Big Bob Ferguson, the finest three-quarter Richmond ever had. He was always a good-natured chap. It’s like him to be so concerned over a friend’s case.”"
"福尔摩斯若有所思地看着我，摇了摇头。","Holmes looked at me thoughtfully and shook his head."
"“我真不知道你智力的底线在哪里，华生。”他说道。“你总是能抛出一些让我惊异的想法。好了，乖乖地帮我写封电报吧，电文是‘乐意调查您的事情。’”","“I never get your limits, Watson,” said he. “There are unexplored possibilities about you. Take a wire down, like a good fellow. ‘Will examine your case with pleasure.’ ”"
"“您的事情！”","“*Your* case!”"
"“咱们可不能让他以为，我这家侦探社是一个收容低能儿的慈善机构。这当然是他自个儿的事情。把电报发给他吧，明早再谈这件事情。”","“We must not let him think that this agency is a home for the weak-minded. Of course it is his case. Send him that wire and let the matter rest till morning.”"
"第二天上午十点整，弗格森大步走进了我们的房间。我记忆中的他是个颀长瘦削的人，凭借敏捷的身手和飞快的速度突破过不知道多少名敌方后卫的拦截。可想而知，如果你见过一位优秀运动员全盛时期的模样，眼下却发现他仅余骸骨，就会觉得人生之中的憾事莫过于此。他伟岸的身形已经坍塌，亚麻色的头发稀稀拉拉，肩背也佝偻如弓。要我说，看到我的时候，他恐怕也产生了同样的感觉。","Promptly at ten o’clock next morning Ferguson strode into our room. I had remembered him as a long, slab-sided man with loose limbs and a fine turn of speed which had carried him round many an opposing back. There is surely nothing in life more painful than to meet the wreck of a fine athlete whom one has known in his prime. His great frame had fallen in, his flaxen hair was scanty, and his shoulders were bowed. I fear that I roused corresponding emotions in him."
"“嗨，华生，”他开口说道，声音倒是跟以前一样浑厚热忱。“那一次在老鹿公园[^8]，我把你隔着绳子扔进了人群，要我说，你眼下的样子可跟那时大不一样啦。依我看，我自个儿肯定也变了一点儿。不过，最近这一两天才真是让我老了不少。福尔摩斯先生，您的电报已经让我明白，假装别人的代表是一件毫无用处的事情。”","“Hullo, Watson,” said he, and his voice was still deep and hearty . “You don’t look quite the man you did when I threw you over the ropes into the crowd at the Old Deer Park. I expect I have changed a bit also. But it’s this last day or two that has aged me. I see by your telegram, Mr. Holmes, that it is no use my pretending to be anyone’s deputy.”"
"“还是直来直去比较简单。”福尔摩斯说道。","“It is simpler to deal direct,” said Holmes."
"“那是自然。可您肯定能够理解，我谈论的是我最应该保护、最应该帮助的那个女人，确实是很难开口。我能怎么办呢？总不能把这样的事情交给警察吧？可是，孩子们的安全也不能不保护啊。这只是一时的疯狂吗，福尔摩斯先生？会不会是天生的呢？您以前见过类似的事情吗？看在上帝分上，给我一些指点吧，我真的已经一筹莫展了啊。”","“Of course it is. But you can imagine how difficult it is when you are speaking of the one woman whom you are bound to protect and help. What can I do? How am I to go to the police with such a story? And yet the kiddies have got to be protected. Is it madness, Mr. Holmes? Is it something in the blood? Have you any similar case in your experience? For God’s sake, give me some advice, for I am at my wit’s end.”"
"“您这种反应十分正常，弗格森先生。好了，您到这边坐下，打起精神好好回答我几个问题。我可以跟您打包票，我不仅是远远没到一筹莫展的地步，而且有信心找出一个解决的办法。首先，请您把您已经采取的措施告诉我。您的妻子还在孩子们的身边吗？”","“Very naturally, Mr. Ferguson. Now sit here and pull yourself together and give me a few clear answers. I can assure you that I am very far from being at my wit’s end, and that I am confident we shall find some solution. First of all, tell me what steps you have taken. Is your wife still near the children?”"
"“当时的场面可怕极了。她是个情深爱重的女人，福尔摩斯先生。要说这世上有哪个女人全心全意地爱过一个男人的话，她就是这么爱我的。看到我撞破了她那个毛骨悚然、匪夷所思的秘密，她伤心到了极点。她连话都不肯说，根本不反驳我的指责，只是直勾勾地看着我，眼神又狂野又绝望。接下来，她一头冲进自己的房间，把自己锁了起来，再也不肯跟我见面。她有个从娘家带来的女仆，名字叫做多洛雷丝，不像是她的仆人，倒像是她的朋友。这个女仆负责给她送饭。”","“We had a dreadful scene. She is a most loving woman, Mr. Holmes. If ever a woman loved a man with all her heart and soul, she loves me. She was cut to the heart that I should have discovered this horrible, this incredible, secret. She would not even speak. She gave no answer to my reproaches, save to gaze at me with a sort of wild, despairing look in her eyes. Then she rushed to her room and locked herself in. Since then she has refused to see me. She has a maid who was with her before her marriage, Dolores by name—a friend rather than a servant. She takes her food to her.”"
"“如此说来，那个孩子暂时没有危险喽？”","“Then the child is in no immediate danger?”"
"“保姆梅森太太已经发了誓，日日夜夜都不会离开孩子。保姆那边倒没有什么不放心的，我只是有点儿担心我可怜的小杰克，我不是在信里说了嘛，我妻子打过他两次。”","“Mrs. Mason, the nurse, has sworn that she will not leave it night or day . I can absolutely trust her. I am more uneasy about poor little Jack, for, as I told you in my note, he has twice been assaulted by her.”"
"“可他应该没有伤着吧？”","“But never wounded?”"
"“伤倒没伤着，可她下手很重。更让她这种行为显得可怕的是，杰克不过是可怜的小瘸子，从来都不招人讨厌。”说到儿子的时候，弗格森憔悴的面容变得柔和起来。“按常理说，谁看见这个乖孩子的残疾都会心软啊。这是因为他小的时候摔过一跤，脊柱受了损伤，福尔摩斯先生。他身体虽然有残疾，性情却乖巧极了，孝顺极了。”","“No, she struck him savagely . It is the more terrible as he is a poor little inoffensive cripple.” Ferguson’s gaunt features softened as he spoke of his boy. “You would think that the dear lad’s condition would soften anyone’s heart. A fall in childhood and a twisted spine, Mr. Holmes. But the dearest, most loving heart within.”"
"福尔摩斯已经把前一天的信拿了起来，重新读了一遍。“您的宅子里还有些什么人呢，弗格森先生？”","Holmes had picked up the letter of yesterday and was reading it over. “What other inmates are there in your house, Mr. Ferguson?”"
"“还有两个刚来不久的仆人。此外就是马夫迈克尔，他也睡在我们那座宅子里。再算上我妻子、我自己、我儿子杰克、小家伙、多洛雷丝和梅森太太，别的就没有了。”","“Two servants who have not been long with us. One stable-hand, Michael, who sleeps in the house. My wife, myself, my boy Jack, baby, Dolores, and Mrs. Mason. That is all.”"
"“依我看，结婚的时候，您对您的妻子并不是非常了解吧？”","“I gather that you did not know your wife well at the time of your marriage?”"
"“那时我刚认识她几个星期。” ","“I had only known her a few weeks.”"
"“这个名叫多洛雷丝的女仆跟了她多久呢？”","“How long had this maid Dolores been with her?”"
"“好些年了。” ","“Some years.”"
"“如此说来，多洛雷丝应该比您更了解您妻子的性格吧？”","“Then your wife’s character would really be better known by Dolores than by you?”"
"“是的，这么说也不为过。”","“Yes, you may say so.”"
"福尔摩斯把这一点记在了本子上。","Holmes made a note."
"“按我看，”他说道，“我去兰伯里应该会比待在这儿有用。这件案子显然需要亲身调查。既然这位女士待在房间里不露面，我们的到场也不会对她造成冒犯和不便。当然喽，我们会住在旅馆里的。”","“I fancy,” said he, “that I may be of more use at Lamberley than here. It is eminently a case for personal investigation. If the lady remains in her room, our presence could not annoy or inconvenience her. Of course, we would stay at the inn.”"
"弗格森做了个如释重负的手势。","Ferguson gave a gesture of relief."
"“这正是我的期望，福尔摩斯先生。您要是能去的话，维多利亚车站有一班两点钟的火车，时间正合适。”","“It is what I hoped, Mr. Holmes. There is an excellent train at two from Victoria if you could come.”"
"“我们当然能去。这一阵的业务比较清淡，我可以全力调查您的事情。当然，华生也会跟咱们一起去的。不过，出发之前，还有一两个细节需要彻底弄清。按我的理解，这位不幸的女士似乎对两个孩子都下过手，一个是她亲生的婴孩，一个是您年少的儿子，对吧？”","“Of course we could come. There is a lull at present. I can give you my undivided energies. Watson, of course, comes with us. But there are one or two points upon which I wish to be very sure before I start. This unhappy lady, as I understand it, has appeared to assault both the children, her own baby and your little son?”"
"“确实是这样。”","“That is so.”"
"“不过，她对两个孩子下手的方法不一样，不是吗？对于您的儿子，她用的是殴打的方法。”","“But the assaults take different forms, do they not? She has beaten your son.”"
"“一次是用手杖，另一次是用手狠狠地打。”","“Once with a stick and once very savagely with her hands.”"
"“她没有说她为什么打孩子吗？”","“Did she give no explanation why she struck him?”"
"“没有，她只是说她恨这个孩子，说了一遍又一遍。”","“None save that she hated him. Again and again she said so.”"
"“呃，当后妈的经常都是这样。过世之人也会成为嫉妒的对象，咱们不妨这么解释。这位女士是个爱嫉妒的人吗？”","“Well, that is not unknown among stepmothers. A posthumous jealousy , we will say. Is the lady jealous by nature?”"
"“是的，她的嫉妒心非常强烈，跟她那份火辣辣的热带深情不相上下。”","“Yes, she is very jealous—jealous with all the strength of her fiery tropical love.”"
"“再来说这个孩子——您刚才说了，他已经十五岁了。既然他在身体活动方面受到了一定的限制，心智方面多半会相当早熟。他没有说他为什么挨打吗？”","“But the boy—he is fifteen, I understand, and probably very developed in mind, since his body has been circumscribed in action. Did he give you no explanation of these assaults?”"
"“没有，他说是无缘无故的。” ","“No, he declared there was no reason.”"
"“他们两个平常关系好吗？”","“Were they good friends at other times?”"
"“不好，他们两个一点儿都不亲。” ","“No, there was never any love between them.”"
"“您不是说他很孝顺吗？”","“Yet you say he is affectionate?”"
"“世上再不会有像他那么孝顺的儿子。我的生命就是他的生命，他时时刻刻都关注着我的一言一行。”","“Never in the world could there be so devoted a son. My life is his life. He is absorbed in what I say or do.”"
"福尔摩斯又做了一条笔记，然后就坐在那里沉思了一会儿。","Once again Holmes made a note. For some time he sat lost in thought."
"“毫无疑问，再婚之前，您跟这个孩子是一对非常好的伙伴。你们两个形影不离，对吧？”","“No doubt you and the boy were great comrades before this second marriage. You were thrown very close together, were you not?”"
"“形影不离。”","“Very much so.”"
"“还有啊，这孩子既然如此孝顺，肯定也对他的母亲念念不忘吧？”","“And the boy, having so affectionate a nature, was devoted, no doubt, to the memory of his mother?”"
"“念念不忘。”","“Most devoted.”"
"“照我看，他显然是一个很有意思的孩子。关于继母打孩子的事情，还有个细节我想问一问。婴孩遭受的诡异攻击和您儿子遭受的殴打，两件事情是不是同时发生的呢？”","“He would certainly seem to be a most interesting lad. There is one other point about these assaults. Were the strange attacks upon the baby and the assaults upon your son at the same period?”"
"“第一次是这样的，情形就像是她突然发了狂，同时拿两个孩子出气。第二次则只是杰克一个人吃了苦头，小家伙并没有遇上什么让梅森太太担心的事情。”","“In the first case it was so. It was as if some frenzy had seized her, and she had vented her rage upon both. In the second case it was only Jack who suffered. Mrs. Mason had no complaint to make about the baby.”"
"“这样的话，事情自然会显得更加复杂。”","“That certainly complicates matters.”"
"“我不太明白您的意思，福尔摩斯先生。”","“I don’t quite follow you, Mr. Holmes.”"
"“不明白也是情有可原的。人难免会产生一些初步的假设，等着接受时间和深入调查的检验。这个习惯并不好，弗格森先生，没办法，人性就是这么软弱。要我说，您这位老朋友对我那些科学方法的形容恐怕有点儿夸大。不管怎么样，眼下我只想说一句，我并不觉得您这个问题无法解决，还有啊，两点钟的时候，您会在维多利亚车站见到我们的。”","“Possibly not. One forms provisional theories and waits for time or fuller knowledge to explode them. A bad habit, Mr. Ferguson, but human nature is weak. I fear that your old friend here has given an exaggerated view of my scientific methods. However, I will only say at the present stage that your problem does not appear to me to be insoluble, and that you may expect to find us at Victoria at two o’clock.”"
"这是十一月里一个阴沉多雾的日子，傍晚时分，我俩已经把行李寄在兰伯里的切克斯旅馆[^9]，驱车碾过萨塞克斯郡的黏土地面，沿着一条漫长曲折的乡间小路赶到了弗格森居住的那座孤零零的古老农庄。这是一座枝枝蔓蔓的大宅子，中央的建筑非常古老，厢房则非常新，都铎式[^10]的烟囱高耸入云，陡峻的霍舍姆石板[^11]屋顶苔痕点点。门口的台阶已经凹陷，门廊墙壁的古老花砖上刻着一块奶酪和一个人形，暗示着宅子建造者的姓氏[^12]。屋里的天花板上排列着一根根沉重的橡木椽子，地板则起伏不平，呈现出一个个深深的凹坑。整座宅子摇摇欲坠，弥漫着一股陈旧衰朽的味道。","It was evening of a dull, foggy November day when, having left our bags at the Chequers, Lamberley, we drove through the Sussex clay of a long winding lane and finally reached the isolated and ancient farmhouse in which Ferguson dwelt. It was a large, straggling building, very old in the centre, very new at the wings with towering T udor chimneys and a lichen-spotted, high-pitched roof of Horsham slabs. The doorsteps were worn into curves, and the ancient tiles which lined the porch were marked with the rebus of a cheese and a man after the original builder. Within, the ceilings were corrugated with heavy oaken beams, and the uneven floors sagged into sharp curves. An odour of age and decay pervaded the whole crumbling building."
"弗格森把我们领进了宅子中央那个十分宽敞的房间，房间里有一个巨大的老式壁炉，炉膛里的铁护栅标着“1670”这个年份。壁炉里柴火熊熊，噼啪作响。","There was one very large central room into which Ferguson led us. Here, in a huge old-fashioned fireplace with an iron screen behind it dated 1670, there blazed and spluttered a splendid log fire."
"环顾四周，我发现这个房间从时代和地域上都可以说是一盘奇异至极的大杂烩。下半部镶有橡木墙板的黄色灰泥墙壁多半是十七世纪那个自耕农的原作，墙板上却点缀着一排精挑细选的现代水彩画，与此同时，墙板上方的壁挂则是一些精美的南美器皿和武器，显然是楼上那位秘鲁女士带来的东西。见此情景，急性子的福尔摩斯立刻产生了抑制不住的好奇，于是他站起身来，仔仔细细地检查了一遍房里的陈设，然后才带着意味深长的眼神走了回来。","The room, as I gazed round, was a most singular mixture of dates and of places. The half-panelled walls may well have belonged to the original yeoman farmer of the seventeenth century. They were ornamented, however, on the lower part by a line of well-chosen modern water-colours; while above, where yellow plaster took the place of oak, there was hung a fine collection of South American utensils and weapons, which had been brought, no doubt, by the Peruvian lady upstairs. Holmes rose, with that quick curiosity which sprang from his eager mind, and examined them with some care. He returned with his eyes full of thought."
"“嘿！”他嚷道。“嘿！”","“Hullo!” he cried. “Hullo!”"
"墙角的篮子里躺着一条斯班尼犬[^13]，眼下正在举步维艰地慢慢地走向主人。它的后腿一瘸一拐，尾巴也耷拉在地上。走到近前之后，它舔了舔弗格森的手。","A spaniel had lain in a basket in the corner. It came slowly forward towards its master, walking with difficulty. Its hind legs moved irregularly and its tail was on the ground. It licked Ferguson’s hand."
"“您看到什么了呢，福尔摩斯先生？”","“What is it, Mr. Holmes?”"
"“这只狗。它怎么啦？”","“The dog. What’s the matter with it?”"
"“兽医也说不清楚，只是说这可能是某种麻痹症，兴许是髓膜炎。不过，它的病正在痊愈，很快就会恢复正常的——对吧，‘卡罗’？”","“That’s what puzzled the vet. A sort of paralysis. Spinal meningitis, he thought. But it is passing. He’ll be all right soon—won’t you, Carlo?”"
"小狗抖了抖耷拉的尾巴，似乎是对主人的话表示同意。它用可怜巴巴的眼神挨个儿打量着我们，显然是知道我们正在讨论它的病情。","A shiver of assent passed through the drooping tail. The dog’s mournful eyes passed from one of us to the other. He knew that we were discussing his case."
"“它的病来得突然吗？”","“Did it come on suddenly?”"
"“一夜之间就变成这样了。”","“In a single night.”"
"“那是多久以前的事情？” ","“How long ago?”"
"“大概是四个月之前吧。” ","“It may have been four months ago.”"
"“非常古怪，很有启发。”","“Very remarkable. Very suggestive.”"
"“这事情给了您什么启发呢，福尔摩斯先生？” ","“What do you see in it, Mr. Holmes?”"
"“证实了我原有的想法。”","“A confirmation of what I had already thought.”"
"“看在上帝分上，您的想法到底是什么啊，福尔摩斯先生？这对您来说可能只是一次智力测验，但却关系到我的生死啊！我妻子没准儿是个凶手，我孩子又时刻面临着危险！别拿我开玩笑，福尔摩斯先生，这事情实在是太严重了。”","“For God’s sake, what do you think, Mr. Holmes? It may be a mere intellectual puzzle to you, but it is life and death to me! My wife a would-be murderer—my child in constant danger! Don’t play with me, Mr. Holmes. It is too terribly serious.”"
"这位身材魁梧的橄榄球中卫急得全身发抖，福尔摩斯把手搭在了他的胳膊上，以示安抚。","The big Rugby three-quarter was trembling all over. Holmes put his hand soothingly upon his arm."
"“依我看，弗格森先生，这事情恐怕会给您造成痛苦，怎么解决都是一样。”他说道。“我会尽量减轻您的痛苦的。眼下我只能说到这个程度，不过，离开这座房子之前，我应该能拿出一个明确的解释。”","“I fear that there is pain for you, Mr. Ferguson, whatever the solution may be,” said he. “I would spare you all I can. I cannot say more for the instant, but before I leave this house I hope I may have something definite.”"
"“但愿如此！恕我失陪，两位，我得到楼上去一趟，看看我妻子那里有没有什么变化。”","“Please God you may! If you will excuse me, gentlemen, I will go up to my wife’s room and see if there has been any change.”"
"他走了之后，福尔摩斯继续检查墙上的新奇物件。过了几分钟，主人垂头丧气地走了回来，显然是碰了一鼻子灰。跟他一起来的还有一个身材瘦高的褐皮肤姑娘。","He was away some minutes, during which Holmes resumed his examination of the curiosities upon the wall. When our host returned it was clear from his downcast face that he had made no progress. He brought with him a tall, slim, brown-faced girl."
"“茶点准备好了，多洛雷丝。”弗格森说道。“你得把你的女主人照顾好，不能让她缺东少西。”","“The tea is ready , Dolores,” said Ferguson. “See that your mistress has everything she can wish.”"
"“她病得很厉害。”姑娘叫道，义愤填膺地看着主人。“她没有要吃的。她病得很厉害，得看医生才行。没有医生的话，我可不敢单独跟她待在一起。”","“She verra ill,” cried the girl, looking with indignant eyes at her master. “She no ask for food. She verra ill. She need doctor. I frightened stay alone with her without doctor.”"
"弗格森用询问的眼神看着我。 ","Ferguson looked at me with a question in his eyes."
"“能帮上忙的话，我乐意效劳。”","“I should be so glad if I could be of use.”"
"“你的女主人愿意见华生医生吗？”","“Would your mistress see Dr. Watson?”"
"“我带他去吧。我不用征得她的同意，因为她必须得看医生。”","“I take him. I no ask leave. She needs doctor.”"
"“那我现在就跟你去。”","“Then I’ll come with you at once.”"
"我跟着这个激动得浑身颤抖的姑娘上了楼，沿着一条古老的过道往前走，过道尽头是一扇铁皮加固的厚重门扉。看到这扇门，我突然想到，即便弗格森打算强行闯入妻子的房间，恐怕也不是一件容易的事情。姑娘从口袋里掏出一把钥匙，沉重的橡木门板绕着古老的门枢吱吱呀呀地转动起来。把我让进房间之后，她飞快地跟了进来，随手闩上了门。","I followed the girl, who was quivering with strong emotion, up the staircase and down an ancient corridor. At the end was an iron-clamped and massive door. It struck me as I looked at it that if Ferguson tried to force his way to his wife he would find it no easy matter. The girl drew a key from her pocket, and the heavy oaken planks creaked upon their old hinges. I passed in and she swiftly followed, fastening the door behind her."
"床上躺着一个女人，显然是发着高烧。她处于半昏迷的状态，不过，听到我进房之后，她还是抬起头来，用她那双惊惶却不失美丽的眼睛畏怯地瞪着我。看到来的是个陌生人，她反倒像是如释重负，跟着就叹了一声，把脑袋靠回了枕头上。我走到她的身边，说了几句安慰的话，于是她一动不动地躺在那里，听凭我给她量脉搏和体温。她脉搏很快、体温也很高，可我觉得她并不是真的发了什么急症，症状都是因为情绪波动和精神压力。","On the bed a woman was lying who was clearly in a high fever. She was only half conscious, but as I entered she raised a pair of frightened but beautiful eyes and glared at me in apprehension. Seeing a stranger, she appeared to be relieved and sank back with a sigh upon the pillow. I stepped up to her with a few reassuring words, and she lay still while I took her pulse and temperature. Both were high, and yet my impression was that the condition was rather that of mental and nervous excitement than of any actual seizure."
"“她就这么躺着，一天，两天。我担心她活不了啦。”姑娘说道。","“She lie like that one day , two day. I ’fraid she die,” said the girl."
"床上的女人把她那张潮红的秀丽脸庞转向了我。","The woman turned her flushed and handsome face towards me."
"“我丈夫在哪儿？”","“Where is my husband?”"
"“他就在楼下，正想来看看您呢。”","“He is below and would wish to see you.”"
"“我不想见他，不想见他。”接下来，她似乎陷入了一种谵妄状态。“好一个恶魔！好一个恶魔！唉，我该拿这个妖孽怎么办哪？”","“I will not see him. I will not see him.” Then she seemed to wander off into delirium. “ A fiend! A fiend! Oh, what shall I do with this devil?”"
"“需要我帮忙吗？”","“Can I help you in any way?”"
"“没用，没人能帮我的忙。完了，全完了。我怎么做也没用，全完了。”","“No. No one can help. It is finished. All is destroyed. Do what I will, all is destroyed.”"
"这个女人肯定是产生了某种古怪的幻觉，我可看不出来，为人正派的鲍勃·弗格森怎么能跟恶魔和妖孽扯到一起。","The woman must have some strange delusion. I could not see honest Bob Ferguson in the character of fiend or devil."
"“夫人，”我说道，“您的丈夫非常爱您，这次的事情弄得他非常伤心。”","“Madame,” I said, “your husband loves you dearly. He is deeply grieved at this happening.”"
"她那双美丽动人的眼睛又一次转向了我。","Again she turned on me those glorious eyes."
"“他确实爱我，没错。我就不爱他吗？我宁可牺牲自己也不愿意伤他的心，不就是因为爱他吗？我爱他爱到这种程度，他竟然能把我想成——竟然能把我说成那样。”","“He loves me. Yes. But do I not love him? Do I not love him even to sacrifice myself rather than break his dear heart? That is how I love him. And yet he could think of me—he could speak of me so.”"
"“他觉得非常痛苦，可他想不明白这是怎么回事。”","“He is full of grief, but he cannot understand.”"
"“是啊，他是想不明白。可他应该信任我。”","“No, he cannot understand. But he should trust.”"
"“您能见见他吗？”我如是提议。","“Will you not see him?” I suggested."
"“不，不行，我忘不了他那些恶毒的话，忘不了他脸上的那种表情。我不想见他。走吧，您帮不了我的忙。就有一件事情，您替我告诉他。我要我的孩子，这是我的权利。我对他无话可说，只有这么一句。”说到这里，她转脸冲着墙壁，再也不肯开口。","“No, no, I cannot forget those terrible words nor the look upon his face. I will not see him. Go now. You can do nothing for me. T ell him only one thing. I want my child. I have a right to my child. That is the only message I can send him.” She turned her face to the wall and would say no more."
"我回到楼下的时候，弗格森和福尔摩斯仍然坐在壁炉旁边。弗格森闷闷不乐地听我讲完了见面的情形。","I returned to the room downstairs, where Ferguson and Holmes still sat by the fire. Ferguson listened moodily to my account of the interview ."
"“我怎么敢把孩子交给她呢？”他说道。“我怎么知道她会发什么样的怪病呢？她带着满嘴的鲜血从小家伙身边站起来的情景，我怎么忘得掉呢？”想到当时的情景，他不由得打了个寒战。“孩子在梅森太太身边才会安全，我只能让他继续待在那儿。”","“How can I send her the child?” he said. “How do I know what strange impulse might come upon her? How can I ever forget how she rose from beside it with its blood upon her lips?” He shuddered at the recollection. “The child is safe with Mrs. Mason, and there he must remain.”"
"说话间，一名女仆已经把茶点端了进来。这名女仆衣着入时，可说是我们进门之后看到的第一件摩登事物。女仆还在斟茶递水的时候，房门开了，一个少年走进了房间。少年的模样引人注目，脸色苍白，头发金黄，一看到自己的父亲，他那双敏感的淡蓝色眼睛立刻闪出了惊喜的火花。他冲上前来，张开双臂搂住了父亲的脖子，亲昵得就像一个撒娇的女儿。","A smart maid, the only modern thing which we had seen in the house, had brought in some tea. As she was serving it the door opened and a youth entered the room. He was a remarkable lad, pale-faced and fair-haired, with excitable light blue eyes which blazed into a sudden flame of emotion and joy as they rested upon his father. He rushed forward and threw his arms round his neck with the abandon of a loving girl."
"“哦，爸爸，”他大声喊道，“没想到您回来得这么早，我应该在这儿接您才是。哦，看到您我真是高兴极了！”","“Oh, daddy ,” he cried, “I did not know that you were due yet. I should have been here to meet you. Oh, I am so glad to see you!”"
"弗格森轻轻地挣脱了少年的拥抱，神色多少有点儿尴尬。","Ferguson gently disengaged himself from the embrace with some little show of embarrassment."
"“好小伙子，”他一边说，一边轻抚金发少年的脑袋。“我回来得早，是因为我说动了这两位朋友今晚过来作客，一位是福尔摩斯先生，一位是华生医生。”","“Dear old chap,” said he, patting the flaxen head with a very tender hand. “I came early because my friends, Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson, have been persuaded to come down and spend an evening with us.”"
"“就是当侦探的那个福尔摩斯先生吗？”","“Is that Mr. Holmes, the detective?”"
"“是的。”","“Yes.”"
"少年直勾勾地看着我俩，目光不只是十分锐利，照我看还不太友好。","The youth looked at us with a very penetrating and, as it seemed to me, unfriendly gaze."
"“您另外那个孩子呢，弗格森先生？”福尔摩斯问道。“我们能看看那个小家伙吗？”","“What about your other child, Mr. Ferguson?” asked Holmes. “Might we make the acquaintance of the baby?”"
"“叫梅森太太把小家伙抱下来吧。”弗格森说道。少年蹒跚着走出了房间，步态十分古怪，凭我当医生的眼光，一眼就可以看出他脊柱受过损伤。他很快就走了回来，身后跟着一个又高又瘦的女人。女人怀里的婴孩非常漂亮，黑眼睛、金头发，堪称是撒克逊血统和拉丁血统的绝妙融合。弗格森从女人手里接过婴孩，无比轻柔地抚弄起来，显然是对他疼爱有加。","“Ask Mrs. Mason to bring baby down,” said Ferguson. The boy went off with a curious, shambling gait which told my surgical eyes that he was suffering from a weak spine. Presently he returned, and behind him came a tall, gaunt woman bearing in her arms a very beautiful child, dark-eyed, golden-haired, a wonderful mixture of the Saxon and the Latin. Ferguson was evidently devoted to it, for he took it into his arms and fondled it most tenderly ."
"“想想吧，有人连他都忍心伤害。”他低头看着小胖墩儿脖子上那个鲜红刺目的小小疤痕，不由得喃喃自语。","“Fancy anyone having the heart to hurt him,” he muttered as he glanced down at the small, angry red pucker upon the cherub throat."
"就在这个时候，我无意中瞥了一眼福尔摩斯，发现他脸上带着一种极其古怪的专注神情。他的面容凝固不变，如同一件古老的牙雕，他的眼睛只在父子俩的身上停留了一个瞬间，这会儿已经充满好奇地盯住了房间对面。我顺着他的目光看了看，但却只能推想他看的是窗外那个水珠滴答的阴郁花园。窗外的景色确实已经被窗板遮掉了一半，可我仍然能够断定，他专心凝望的正是那扇窗子。","It was at this moment that I chanced to glance at Holmes and saw a most singular intentness in his expression. His face was as set as if it had been carved out of old ivory, and his eyes, which had glanced for a moment at father and child, were now fixed with eager curiosity upon something at the other side of the room. Following his gaze I could only guess that he was looking out through the window at the melancholy, dripping garden. It is true that a shutter had half closed outside and obstructed the view, but none the less it was certainly at the window that Holmes was fixing his concentrated attention."
"接下来，他微微一笑，目光回到了婴孩身上。婴孩的脖子胖乎乎的，上面印着那个小小的疤痕。福尔摩斯不声不响地把伤疤仔细检查了一遍，然后就握了握婴孩的小拳头。肉嘟嘟的小拳头漾着小涡，一直在他面前晃来晃去。","Then he smiled, and his eyes came back to the baby . On its chubby neck there was this small puckered mark. Without speaking, Holmes examined it with care. Finally he shook one of the dimpled fists which waved in front of him."
"“再见，小家伙。你的人生起点可真是不同寻常啊。保姆，我想跟你私下聊两句。”","“Good-bye, little man. You have made a strange start in life. Nurse, I should wish to have a word with you in private.”"
"他把保姆带到一边，郑重其事地聊了几分钟。我只听见了他最后的一句话：“照我看，你很快就不用再担心啦。”从外表上看，保姆是一个性情乖僻、沉默寡言的人。聊完之后，她抱着婴孩离开了房间。","He took her aside and spoke earnestly for a few minutes. I only heard the last words, which were: “Your anxiety will soon, I hope, be set at rest.” The woman, who seemed to be a sour, silent kind of creature, withdrew with the child."
"“梅森太太这个人怎么样呢？”福尔摩斯问道。","“What is Mrs. Mason like?” asked Holmes."
"“您也看见了，她的样子不怎么讨人喜欢，可她有一颗金子般的心，对小家伙也非常疼爱。”","“Not very prepossessing externally, as you can see, but a heart of gold, and devoted to the child.”"
"“你喜欢她吗，杰克？”福尔摩斯突然转向了那个少年。少年摇了摇头，表情丰富的脸庞阴云密布。","“Do you like her, Jack?” Holmes turned suddenly upon the boy. His expressive mobile face shadowed over, and he shook his head."
"“杰克是个爱憎分明的孩子。”弗格森一边说，一边把少年搂在怀里。“还好，我属于他喜欢的那一类。”","“Jacky has very strong likes and dislikes,” said Ferguson, putting his arm round the boy. “Luckily I am one of his likes.”"
"少年哼哼唧唧地一头扎进父亲怀里，弗格森轻轻地推开了他。","The boy cooed and nestled his head upon his father’s breast. Ferguson gently disengaged him."
"“去吧，小杰克。”他说了一句，然后就深情地目送着儿子走出房间。“好了，福尔摩斯先生，”少年出去之后，他接着说道，“我真的觉得，这次我让您白跑了一趟，除了同情之外，您还能给我什么呢？从您的角度来看，这肯定是一件格外难办、格外复杂的事情。”","“Run away, little Jacky,” said he, and he watched his son with loving eyes until he disappeared. “Now, Mr. Holmes,” he continued when the boy was gone, “I really feel that I have brought you on a fool’s errand, for what can you possibly do save give me your sympathy? It must be an exceedingly delicate and complex affair from your point of view.”"
"“难办是肯定的，”我朋友被主人的话逗得笑了起来，“复杂嘛，我到现在还没觉得。我的想法原本只是主观演绎的成果，不过，互不相关的众多细节已经一点一点地证明了我的演绎成果，这样一来，主观就变成了客观，咱们也就可以胸有成竹地宣布，咱们的目标已经实现。事实上，早在咱们离开贝克街之前，我已经实现了这个目标，剩下的工作仅仅是观察和确证而已。”","“It is certainly delicate,” said my friend with an amused smile, “but I have not been struck up to now with its complexity . It has been a case for intellectual deduction, but when this original intellectual deduction is confirmed point by point by quite a number of independent incidents, then the subjective becomes objective and we can say confidently that we have reached our goal. I had, in fact, reached it before we left Baker Street, and the rest has merely been observation and confirmation.”"
"弗格森大手一举，捂住了紧皱的额头。","Ferguson put his big hand to his furrowed forehead."
"“看在上帝分上，福尔摩斯，”他急得嗓子都哑了。“既然您看到了事情的真相，那就别让我担惊受怕了吧。我面临的是什么样的处境？究竟该怎么应付？我并不关心您的真相是怎么来的，只要它确实是真相就行。”","“For heaven’s sake, Holmes,” he said hoarsely; “if you can see the truth in this matter, do not keep me in suspense. How do I stand? What shall I do? I care nothing as to how you have found your facts so long as you have really got them.”"
"“我确实欠您一个解释，您也肯定能听到我的解释。不过，您总得允许我按我自己的方法来处理问题吧？那位女士可以见咱们吗，华生？”","“Certainly I owe you an explanation, and you shall have it. But you will permit me to handle the matter in my own way? Is the lady capable of seeing us, Watson?”"
"“她虽然病了，神志还是挺清醒的。”","“She is ill, but she is quite rational.”"
"“很好。她不在场的话，咱们就没法澄清这件事情。咱们上楼看她去吧。”","“Very good. It is only in her presence that we can clear the matter up. Let us go up to her.”"
"“她不会见我的。”弗格森叫道。","“She will not see me,” cried Ferguson."
"“哦，会的，她会见的。”福尔摩斯说道。他拿起一张纸，草草地写了几行字。“不管怎么样，你还是有通行证的，华生。能不能麻烦你把这张条子带给那位女士呢？”","“Oh, yes, she will,” said Holmes. He scribbled a few lines upon a sheet of paper. “You at least have the entrée, Watson. Will you have the goodness to give the lady this note?”"
"我又一次上了楼，多洛雷丝如临大敌地打开了房门，我把条子交给了她。一分钟之后，房间里响起一声惊喜交集的呼喊，多洛雷丝探出头来。","I ascended again and handed the note to Dolores, who cautiously opened the door. A minute later I heard a cry from within, a cry in which joy and surprise seemed to be blended. Dolores looked out."
"“她愿意见他们，愿意听他们解释。”她如是说道。","“She will see them. She will leesten,” said she."
"听到我的召唤，弗格森和福尔摩斯也上了楼。我们走进房间的时候，弗格森的妻子已经从床上坐起身来。弗格森赶紧往床边走了两步，做妻子的却抬手止住了他，他只好颓然坐进了一把扶手椅。福尔摩斯冲女士躬身施礼，然后就在弗格森的身边坐了下来。女士双眼圆睁，惊异地看着福尔摩斯。","At my summons Ferguson and Holmes came up. As we entered the room Ferguson took a step or two towards his wife, who had raised herself in the bed, but she held out her hand to repulse him. He sank into an armchair, while Holmes seated himself beside him, after bowing to the lady, who looked at him with wide-eyed amazement."
"“依我看，这里没有多洛雷丝的事了，”福尔摩斯说道。“呃，好吧，夫人，您要是希望她留下的话，我看也未尝不可。好了，弗格森先生，我是个俗务缠身的劳碌命，因此就只能采用直截了当的方法。手术越快，痛苦越少。容我首先跟您说一句宽心的话，您的妻子是一位非常善良、非常体贴、非常冤屈的女人。”","“I think we can dispense with Dolores,” said Holmes. “Oh, very well, madame, if you would rather she stayed I can see no objection. Now, Mr. Ferguson, I am a busy man with many calls, and my methods have to be short and direct. The swiftest surgery is the least painful. Let me first say what will ease your mind. Your wife is a very good, a very loving, and a very ill-used woman.”"
"弗格森欢呼一声，挺起了腰板。","Ferguson sat up with a cry of joy."
"“说说您的理由，福尔摩斯先生，我一辈子都感恩不尽。”","“Prove that, Mr. Holmes, and I am your debtor forever.”"
"“我这就说，只不过，为了把这方面的理由说清楚，我只能让您在另一个方面承受巨大的伤害。”","“I will do so, but in doing so I must wound you deeply in another direction.”"
"“只要您能洗清我妻子的冤屈，别的事情我都不在乎。跟这相比，世上的一切都只能说是无关紧要。”","“I care nothing so long as you clear my wife. Everything on earth is insignificant compared to that.”"
"“那我就跟您讲讲，在贝克街的时候，从我心头掠过的是怎样一串环环相扣的演绎。我一向觉得，吸血鬼的说法纯属荒诞无稽。那样的事情绝不会出现在英格兰的犯罪活动当中。话又说回来，您的观察结果倒是准确无误。您看见的事情是这位女士从婴儿床旁边直起身来，嘴上还沾着鲜血。”","“Let me tell you, then, the train of reasoning which passed through my mind in Baker Street. The idea of a vampire was to me absurd. Such things do not happen in criminal practice in England. And yet your observation was precise. You had seen the lady rise from beside the child’s cot with the blood upon her lips.”"
"“确实如此。”","“I did.”"
"“可是，吮吸流血的伤口不一定是为了吸血，没准儿是另有目的，您难道没有想到吗？英格兰的一位王后[^14]就曾经用这种方法把伤口里的毒吸出来，不是吗？”","“Did it not occur to you that a bleeding wound may be sucked for some other purpose than to draw the blood from it? Was there not a queen in English history who sucked such a wound to draw poison from it?”"
"“毒！”","“Poison!”"
"“您这户人家跟南美有点儿渊源，所以呢，眼睛还没看到您墙上那些武器的时候，直觉就已经让我意识到了它们的存在。小家伙中的也可能是其他类型的毒，可我当时想到的确实是南美武器。等我看到那张小小的射鸟弓，看到它旁边那个空箭壶的时候，感觉不过是意料中事而已。那种箭浸过箭毒[^15]之类的歹毒药物，如果有人用它扎伤了小家伙的话，不把毒吸出来是会致命的。","“A South American household. My instinct felt the presence of those weapons upon the wall before my eyes ever saw them. It might have been other poison, but that was what occurred to me. When I saw that little empty quiver beside the small bird-bow, it was just what I expected to see. If the child were pricked with one of those arrows dipped in curare or some other devilish drug, it would mean death if the venom were not sucked out."
"“还有那条小狗！如果有人打算使用这样的毒物，肯定会通过试验来确定它没有失效，这不是理所当然的吗？小狗的事情并不在我的意料之中，可我至少是一眼看清了它的遭遇，而它的遭遇也跟我的推测不谋而合。","“And the dog! If one were to use such a poison, would one not try it first in order to see that it had not lost its power? I did not foresee the dog, but at least I understand him and he fitted into my reconstruction."
"“现在您应该明白了吧？您的妻子一直都在担心这样的袭击。她曾经亲眼看见小家伙遭受袭击，还救了小家伙的命，可她不敢把全部的真相告诉您，因为她知道您有多疼那个大孩子，怕的是伤您的心。”","“Now do you understand? Your wife feared such an attack. She saw it made and saved the child’s life, and yet she shrank from telling you all the truth, for she knew how you loved the boy and feared lest it break your heart.”"
"“杰克！”","“Jacky!”"
"“刚才您抚弄小家伙的时候，我特意观察了一下杰克的反应。有了窗板的衬托，他的脸清清楚楚地映在了窗玻璃上。他脸上写着那么强烈的妒忌、那么刻毒的仇恨，我还很少在其他人的脸上看到呢。”","“I watched him as you fondled the child just now. His face was clearly reflected in the glass of the window where the shutter formed a background. I saw such jealousy, such cruel hatred, as I have seldom seen in a human face.”"
"“我的杰克！”","“My Jacky!”"
"“您只能面对现实，弗格森先生。格外让人痛苦的是，他的举动恰恰是出自一种扭曲的爱、一种膨胀到了疯狂地步的爱，这种爱的目标不光是您，兴许还包括他去世的母亲。仇恨的烈火吞噬了他的灵魂，他恨那个漂亮的小家伙，因为小家伙的健美正好衬出了他自个儿的缺陷。”","“You have to face it, Mr. Ferguson. It is the more painful because it is a distorted love, a maniacal exaggerated love for you, and possibly for his dead mother, which has prompted his action. His very soul is consumed with hatred for this splendid child, whose health and beauty are a contrast to his own weakness.”"
"“老天啊！这不可能！”","“Good God! It is incredible!”"
"“我说的是事实吗，夫人？”","“Have I spoken the truth, madame?”"
"女士已经抽泣起来，把脸埋在了枕头里面。听到福尔摩斯的问话，她转向了自己的丈夫。","The lady was sobbing, with her face buried in the pillows. Now she turned to her husband."
"“我怎么敢告诉你呢，鲍勃？我完全能够体会到，这样的事情会对你造成多大的打击。我觉得我应该守口如瓶，等别人来把这件事情告诉你，这样才会好一些。刚才啊，这位魔法师一般的先生写条子说他全都知道了，看到他的条子，我真是高兴极了。”","“How could I tell you, Bob? I felt the blow it would be to you. It was better that I should wait and that it should come from some other lips than mine. When this gentleman, who seems to have powers of magic, wrote that he knew all, I was glad.”"
"“依我看，为期一年的海上航行应该会对杰克少爷有所帮助。”福尔摩斯一边说，一边站了起来。“只有一件事情我仍然不太明白，夫人。我们完全可以理解您殴打杰克少爷的事情，母亲的忍耐终归是有限度的。可是，前面这两天，您怎么敢撇下小家伙不管呢？”","“I think a year at sea would be my prescription for Master Jacky ,” said Holmes, rising from his chair. “Only one thing is still clouded, madame.

"“照我看，华生，咱们退场的时候已经到了。”福尔摩斯轻声说道。“多洛雷丝未免有点儿忠诚过头啦，麻烦你搀住她的一只胳膊，我来搀另外一只。好了，”带上房门之后，他又补了一句，“要我说，剩下的事情都可以让他俩自己解决。”","“This, I fancy, is the time for our exit, Watson,” said Holmes in a whisper. “If you will take one elbow of the too faithful Dolores, I will take the other. There, now,” he added as he closed the door behind him, “I think we may leave them to settle the rest among themselves.”"
"这件案子只有一点需要补充，那便是福尔摩斯针对故事开头那封短柬的最终答复。他的回信全文如下：","I have only one further note of this case. It is the letter which Holmes wrote in final answer to that with which the narrative begins. It ran thus: "
