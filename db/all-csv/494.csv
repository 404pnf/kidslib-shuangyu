"Snow-White and Rose-Red","雪白与玫瑰红"
"by Andrew Lang","作者：安德鲁·朗格"
"A poor widow once lived in a little cottage with a garden in front of it, in which grew two rose trees, one bearing white roses and the other red.","从前，在一个小农舍里住着一位贫穷的寡妇。农舍的前面是座花园，花园里栽着两株玫瑰树，一株开白玫瑰，另一株开红玫瑰。"
"She had two children, who were just like the two rose trees; one was called Snow-white and the other Rose-red, and they were the sweetest and best children in the world, always diligent and always cheerful; but Snow-white was quieter and more gentle than Rose-red.","这个寡妇有两个孩子，就像两株玫瑰一样。一个叫雪白，一个叫玫瑰红，她们是世上最甜美、最顶呱呱的孩子。她们一向吃苦耐劳，总是快快乐乐的。但是，和玫瑰红相比，雪白则更显文静温和。"
"Rose-red loved to run about the fields and meadows, and to pick flowers and catch butterflies; but Snow-white sat at home with her mother and helped her in the household, or read aloud to her when there was no work to do.","玫瑰红喜欢在田间草地跑来跑去，还喜欢摘花和扑蝴蝶；而雪白就和妈妈呆在家里，帮妈妈干些家务活，或在闲暇时大声朗读故事给妈妈听。"
"The two children loved each other so dearly that they always walked about hand in hand whenever they went out together, and when Snow-white said, “We will never desert each other,” Rose-red answered: “No, not as long as we live”; and the mother added: “Whatever one gets she shall share with the other.”","两个姐妹感情至深，不管什么时候，只要她们一块儿外出散步，总是手挽着手。当雪白说：“我们决不会分开。”玫瑰红就会回答：“只要我们活着，就不会分开。”妈妈则会加上一句：“有福同享，有难同当。”"
"They often roamed about in the woods gathering berries and no beast offered to hurt them; on the contrary, they came up to them in the most confiding manner; the little hare would eat a cabbage leaf from their hands, the deer grazed beside them, the stag would bound past them merrily, and the birds remained on the branches and sang to them with all their might.","她们常常跑进森林采摘红浆果，野兽从不伤害她们，相反，它们以最亲热的方式接近她们。小兔啃食她们手中的白菜叶，小鹿在她们身旁吃着草，小马在她们身边活蹦乱跳，还有小鸟儿坐在枝丫上，尽情地为他们唱歌。","","","","sang to them是“为他们唱歌”-0.2"
"No evil ever befell them; if they tarried late in the wood and night overtook them, they lay down together on the moss and slept till morning, and their mother knew they were quite safe, and never felt anxious about them.","她们从来没有遇到过什么危险。如果她们在森林里停留太久，当夜幕降临后，她们便躺在苔藓上，依偎在一起，直到睡到第二天天亮。她们的母亲知道她们很安全，所以从来没有担忧过。"
"Once, when they had slept all night in the wood and had been wakened by the morning sun, they perceived a beautiful child in a shining white robe sitting close to their resting-place.","一次，她们在林里过了一夜，黎明的阳光唤醒了她们，这时她们发现在离她们休息地很近的地方，坐着一个穿着闪闪发光的白色长袍的美少年。"
"The figure got up, looked at them kindly, but said nothing, and vanished into the wood.","他站起身来，友好地看着她们，但却不发一言，随后消失在了林子里。"
"And when they looked round about them they became aware that they had slept quite close to a precipice, over which they would certainly have fallen had they gone on a few steps further in the darkness.","当她们回过神来看四周时，才意识到自己睡在了悬崖峭壁旁。如果她们在黑暗中再往前走上几步，就早已落进万丈深渊中。"
"And when they told their mother of their adventure, she said what they had seen must have been the angel that guards good children.","后来，当她们把这段奇遇告诉母亲时，母亲告诉她们，她们遇见的一定是个保护好孩子的天使。"
"Snow-white and Rose-red kept their mother’s cottage so beautifully clean and neat that it was a pleasure to go into it.","雪白与玫瑰红把母亲的小屋布置得整整洁洁，让人一进屋就身心愉悦。","","","","错别字，应为“布置得”-0.5"
"In summer Rose-red looked after the house, and every morning before her mother awoke she placed a bunch of flowers before the bed, from each tree a rose.","夏天的时候，玫瑰红会整理房屋，每天清早，乘母亲还未醒，她总要从每株玫瑰树上摘些花扎成一束，放在母亲的床头。"
"In winter Snow-white lit the fire and put on the kettle, which was made of brass, but so beautifully polished that it shone like gold.","冬天雪白会生上火，并在铁架上挂个水壶。铜制的壶儿总是擦得亮亮的，像金子般闪闪发光。"
"In the evening when the snowflakes fell their mother said: “Snow-white, go and close the shutters,” and they drew round the fire, while the mother put on her spectacles and read aloud from a big book and the two girls listened and sat and span.","到了晚上，每当天空飘起雪花，她们的母亲总会说：“雪白，去把门拴上。”于是娘儿仨围坐在火炉旁，母亲戴上眼镜，拿着本大书高声地朗读起来。姐妹俩一边听，一边坐着纺纱。"
"Beside them on the ground lay a little lamb, and behind them perched a little white dove with its head tucked under its wings.","就在她们的身旁躺着一头小羊羔，身后的杆子上蹲着只小白鸽，它的头藏在翅膀下。","","","","错别字，应为“身旁”-0.5"
"One evening as they sat thus cosily together someone knocked at the door as though he desired admittance.","一天晚上，当她们正舒舒服服地坐在一起时，听到有人在敲门，似乎想要进来。"
"The mother said: “Rose-red, open the door quickly; it must be some traveler seeking shelter.”","母亲说：“玫瑰红，快去把门开开，一定是位求宿的旅人。”"
"Rose-red hastened to unbar the door, and thought she saw a poor man standing in the darkness outside; but it was no such thing, only a bear, who poked his thick black head through the door.","玫瑰红赶忙拨开了门栓，心想自己会看到站在漆黑夜里的可怜人。但门外站着的却不是个人，而是头熊，它把那笨重的黑脑袋伸进了门。"
"Rose-red screamed aloud and sprang back in terror, the lamb began to bleat, the dove flapped its wings, and Snow-white ran and hid behind her mother’s bed.","玫瑰红尖叫了一声，惊恐地跳了回来，小羊咩咩地叫了起来，鸽子拍打着翅膀，雪白躲到了母亲的床后。"
"But the bear began to speak, and said: “Don’t be afraid: I won’t hurt you.","只听这只熊开口说：“别害怕，我不会伤害你们。"
"I am half frozen, and only wish to warm myself a little.”","我已经冻得不行，我只想在你们旁边取点儿暖。”","","","","错别字，应为“取暖”-0.5"
"“My poor bear,” said the mother, “lie down by the fire, only take care you don’t burn your fur.”","“可怜的熊，”母亲说，“躺到火边来吧，但要小心别烧到你的皮毛。”"
"Then she called out: “Snow-white and Rose-red, come out; the bear will do you no harm; he is a good, honest creature.”","然后她喊道：“雪白，玫瑰红，出来吧！熊对你们没有歹意，它是诚实善良的动物。”"
"So they both came out of their hiding-places, and gradually the lamb and dove drew near too, and they all forgot their fear.","姐妹俩这才从她们的藏身之处走了出来，小羊和鸽子也慢慢靠近过来，都已经忘记了自己的恐惧。"
"The bear asked the children to beat the snow a little out of his fur, and they fetched a brush and scrubbed him till he was dry.","熊请孩子们把它身上的雪稍微拍掉一些，于是她们拿出了刷子，在熊身上擦着，直到它身上变干。"
"Then the beast stretched himself in front of the fire, and growled quite happily and comfortably.","随后，熊将身子在火炉旁伸展开，心满意足、安然自得地发着低鼾音。"
"The children soon grew quite at their ease with him, and led their helpless guest a fearful life.","没多久，孩子们就随和自在地和熊相处了，这使她们无助的客人生活变得很可怕。","","","","错别字，应为“自在地”-0.5"
"They tugged his fur with their hands, put their small feet on his back, and rolled him about here and there, or took a hazel wand and beat him with it; and if he growled they only laughed.","她们用手扯它的毛发，用她们小小的脚踩踏它的背，把它翻过来又覆过去，用榛木枝抽打它，若是它嗷嗷叫，她们就会开心地大笑。"
"The bear submitted to everything with the best possible good-nature, only when they went too far he cried: “Oh! children, spare my life!","熊尽力用它最好的脾气去包容这一切，只有当她们太过分时，它才会喊：“饶了我吧，孩子们！”"
"“Snow-white and Rose-red,","“雪白，玫瑰红，"
"Don’t beat your lover dead.”","不要把你们的恋人给打死了。”"
"When it was time to retire for the night, and the others went to bed, the mother said to the bear: “You can lie there on the hearth, in heaven’s name; it will be shelter for you from the cold and wet.”","睡觉的时候到了，其他人都上床了，母亲对熊说：“你躺到炉火边去吧，上帝保佑，那里会让你远离寒冷和潮湿。”","","","","错别字，应为“其他人”-0.5"
"As soon as day dawned the children led him out, and he trotted over the snow into the wood.","天一亮，姐妹俩把熊放了出去，熊摇摇晃晃地踏着雪走进森林。","","","","抽检结束，扣除2.7差错率27/10000"
"From this time on the bear came every evening at the same hour, and lay down by the hearth and let the children play what pranks they liked with him; and they got so accustomed to him that the door was never shut till their black friend had made his appearance.","从此以后，每到晚上的同一时刻，熊总会到来，躺在炉火旁，让孩子们同它尽情地玩耍。孩子们对它也习以为常，只要这位黑朋友不露面，她们就不肯闩上门。"
"When spring came, and all outside was green, the bear said one morning to Snow-white: “Now I must go away, and not return again the whole summer.”","春天到了，野外一片翠绿。一天早上，熊对雪白说：“现在我得走了，整个夏天都不会再回来。”"
"“Where are you going to, dear bear?” asked Snow-white.","“你要到哪去，亲爱的熊？”雪白问道。"
"“I must go to the wood and protect my treasure from the wicked dwarfs.","“我必须到森林里去保护我的财宝，防止那些可恶的矮子偷窃。"
"In winter, when the earth is frozen hard, they are obliged to remain underground, for they can’t work their way through; but now, when the sun has thawed and warmed the ground, they break through and come up above to spy the land and steal what they can; what once falls into their hands and into their caves is not easily brought back to light.”","冬天，当大地覆盖上了坚硬的一层冰时，它们无法穿透冰层，只得呆在地下面。而现在冰雪消融，和煦的阳光普照着大地，它们就能破土而出，到处撬挖盗窃。一旦有任何东西落入他们手中，被他们带入洞中，就很难重见天日了。”"
"Snow-white was quite sad over their friend’s departure, and when she unbarred the door for him, the bear, stepping out, caught a piece of his fur in the door-knocker, and Snow-white thought she caught sight of glittering gold beneath it, but she couldn’t be certain of it; and the bear ran hastily away, and soon disappeared behind the trees.","雪白为熊的离开而感到难过，她为熊开了门，熊迈出门的时候，门闩抠到它的一撮毛发，雪白似乎看到下面发出一道金光，但又无法确定。熊很快离去了，不一会儿就消失在了树林里。"
"A short time after this the mother sent the children into the wood to collect fagots.","过了一段时间，母亲让姐妹俩去林间捡柴火。"
"They came in their wanderings upon a big tree which lay felled on the ground, and on the trunk among the long grass they noticed something jumping up and down, but what it was they couldn’t distinguish.","她们漫步着来到一棵倒在地上的大树旁，树干旁的草丛中有个东西在来回上蹿下跳，不过看不清是什么东西。"
"When they approached nearer they perceived a dwarf with a wizened face and a beard a yard long.","等她们走近一看，原来是个小矮子，只见他面色枯黄，雪白胡须足有一尺长。"
"The end of the beard was jammed into a cleft of the tree, and the little man sprang about like a dog on a chain, and didn’t seem to know what he was to do.","他的胡须一端正卡在树缝中，这小家伙就像一只拴在绳子上的狗，不停地乱跳，茫然不知所措。"
"He glared at the girls with his fiery red eyes, and screamed out: “What are you standing there for?","小矮人用一双通红的眼睛盯着姐妹俩，嚷道：“还站在那干嘛？"
"Can’t you come and help me?”","你们难道就不会来帮我一把吗？”"
"“What were you doing, little man?” asked Rose-red.","“你在干嘛呢，小个子？”玫瑰红问道。"
"“You stupid, inquisitive goose!”","“你这个愚蠢、多嘴的傻瓜！”"
"replied the dwarf; “I wanted to split the tree, in order to get little chips of wood for our kitchen fire; those thick logs that serve to make fires for coarse, greedy people like yourselves quite burn up all the little food we need.","小矮人回答，“我本想劈棵树弄点儿木屑来生火做饭，木头太大，会让我的饭烧焦，像你们这些贪吃的家伙，都快把我们需要的一丁点儿食物给吃光了。"
"I had successfully driven in the wedge, and all was going well, but the cursed wood was so slippery that it suddenly sprang out, and the tree closed up so rapidly that I had no time to take my beautiful white beard out, so here I am stuck fast, and I can’t get away; and you silly, smooth-faced, milk-and-water girls just stand and laugh!","本来我已经把楔子打进去，一切如我预想的那样进展顺利，可那该死的楔子太滑了，猛地往外弹了出来，树缝便马上合拢，我这漂亮的胡子也就来不及拔出来了。所以我被牢牢地固定在这，无法离开，你们两个痴痴呆呆、油嘴滑舌、油头粉面的毛丫头却站在这发笑！"
"Ugh! what wretches you are!”","呸！你俩真是太可恶了！”"
"The children did all in their power, but they couldn’t get the beard out; it was wedged in far too firmly.","姑娘们使劲浑身解数地帮他拔，可就是拔不出来，胡子在里面卡得太深太紧了。"
"“I will run and fetch somebody,” said Rose-red.","“我去找个帮手来，”玫瑰红说。"
"“Crazy blockheads!” snapped the dwarf; “what’s the good of calling anyone else?","“你这个没头脑的笨丫头！”小矮子咆哮起来了，“找其他人来有什么用？"
"You’re already two too many for me.","你们俩已经够烦人的了。"
"Does nothing better occur to you than that?”","你们就想不到什么更好的办法吗？”"
"“Don’t be so impatient,” said Snow-white, “I’ll see you get help,” and taking her scissors out of her pocket she cut off the end of his beard.","“别着急，”雪白说，“我来帮你。”于是她从口袋掏出一把剪刀，一刀就把胡子的那端给咔嚓了。"
"As soon as the dwarf felt himself free he seized a bag full of gold which was hidden among the roots of the tree, lifted it up, and muttered aloud: “Curse these rude wretches, cutting off a piece of my splendid beard!”","矮子脱身后，一把抓起藏在树根处的口袋，袋中装满了金子。他一手提着袋子，口中嘟哝道：“你们这些粗鲁的家伙，把我这么漂亮的胡须给剪断了，你们不会遭好报的。”"
"With these words he swung the bag over his back, and disappeared without as much as looking at the children again.","说完便把袋子往背上一甩，瞧也不瞧她俩一眼就消失了。"
"Shortly after this Snow-white and Rose-red went out to get a dish of fish.","过了一会儿，为了做一盘鱼，雪白和玫瑰红去钓鱼。"
"As they approached the stream they saw something which looked like an enormous grasshopper springing toward the water as if it were going to jump in.","她俩走近小溪时，突然见到一个像巨大蚱蜢似的东西要往下跳，仿佛随时都会跳入水中。"
"They ran forward and recognized their old friend the dwarf.","她们跑上前一看，认出又是那个旧相识小矮子。"
"“Where are you going to?” asked Rose-red; “you’re surely not going to jump into the water?”","“你上哪儿去？”玫瑰红问，“你确定不是往水里跳吧？”"
"“I’m not such a fool,” screamed the dwarf.","“我才没那么傻呢，”小矮子叫道，"
"“Don’t you see that cursed fish is trying to drag me in?”","“你难道没看到那条该死的鱼想把我拖下水吗？”"
"The little man had been sitting on the bank fishing, when unfortunately the wind had entangled his beard in the line; and when immediately afterward a big fish bit, the feeble little creature had no strength to pull it out; the fish had the upper fin, and dragged the dwarf toward him.","小矮子刚才一直坐在那钓鱼，不巧的是风把他的胡子和鱼线搅在一起了，随后不一会儿，一条大鱼咬食，这位手无缚鸡之力的小矮子可没有力气把鱼给拉上来。鱼儿渐渐占了上风，使劲把小矮子往水中拽。"
"He clung on with all his might to every rush and blade of grass, but it didn’t help him much; he had to follow every movement of the fish, and was in great danger of being drawn into the water.","他只得尽力紧紧抓住每一把草杆和灯芯草，但那又有什么用呢？他只得跟着鱼儿的游动而上下跳动，随时有被拖入水中的危险。"
"The girls came up just at the right moment, held him firm, and did all they could to disentangle his beard from the line; but in vain, beard and line were in a hopeless muddle.","姐妹俩来得正是时候，她们使劲抓住小矮子，尽可能地帮他从胡须上解开鱼线，但都是徒劳，胡须和鱼线无可救药地混作一团。"
"Nothing remained but to produce the scissors and cut the beard, by which a small part of it was sacrificed.","实在无计可施，她们只得拿出剪刀剪胡须，剪掉一小段的胡须。"
"When the dwarf perceived what they were about he yelled to them: “Do you call that manners, you toad-stools! to disfigure a fellow’s face?","小矮子一见便惊声尖叫：“真粗野！你们两个丫头懂得什么叫礼貌么？是想毁我的容吗？"
"It wasn’t enough that you shortened my beard before, but you must now needs cut off the best bit of it.","先前把我的胡须剪短了还不够，现在又剪掉最漂亮的一段，"
"I can’t appear like this before my own people.","我哪还有什么脸去见人？"
"I wish you’d been in Jericho first.”","你们赶快给我滚！”"
"Then he fetched a sack of pearls that lay among the rushes, and without saying another word he dragged it away and disappeared behind a stone.","说完便从草丛中提出一袋珠宝，二话没说就一瘸一拐地消失在岩石后。"
"It happened that soon after this the mother sent the two girls to the town to buy needles, thread, laces, and ribbons.","不久后，母亲又让姐妹俩进城买针线、绳索和缎带。"
"Their road led over a heath where huge boulders of rock lay scattered here and there.","她们沿路来到一片荒地，荒地上四散着布满了巨大的石块。"
"While trudging along they saw a big bird hovering in the air, circling slowly above them, but always descending lower, till at last it settled on a rock not far from them.","迈着艰难的步伐，姐妹俩看见一只大鸟正在空中翱翔，慢慢地又在她们头上盘旋，鸟儿越飞越低，最后停在不远处的一块岩石上。"
"Immediately afterward they heard a sharp, piercing cry.","紧接着她们听到一声凄厉而撕心的惨叫，"
"They ran forward, and saw with horror that the eagle had pounced on their old friend the dwarf, and was about to carry him off.","跑上前一看，她们惊呆了，老鹰把她们的老熟人小矮子给逮住了，就要把他给叼走。"
"The tender-hearted children seized hold of the little man, and struggled so long with the bird that at last he let go his prey.","心肠柔软的孩子们抓住了小矮子，和老鹰奋力抢夺了很久，到最后老鹰张开了爪子，放了小矮子。"
"When the dwarf had recovered from the first shock he screamed in his screeching voice: “Couldn’t you have treated me more carefully?","小矮子第一次受到这样地惊吓，等他回过神来，立刻歇斯底里地大叫：“难道你们就不能小心一点儿吗？"
"You have torn my thin little coat all to shreds, useless, awkward hussies that you are!”","你们把我单薄的小外套给扯成了什么破烂样，你们两个笨手笨手的毛丫头！”"
"Then he took a bag of precious stones and vanished under the rocks into his cave.","说完，他又扛起一袋宝石，钻进了岩石下的洞中。"
"The girls were accustomed to his ingratitude, and went on their way and did their business in town.","姐妹俩对这种忘恩负义的行径早已习以为常，继续到城里办事。"
"On their way home, as they were again passing the heath, they surprised the dwarf pouring out his precious stones on an open space, for he had thought no one would pass by at so late an hour.","回家的路上，她们又途径那片荒地，这下可把小矮子吓了一跳。他正往空地上倒宝石，万万没想到这么晚还会有人来。"
"The evening sun shone on the glittering stones, and they glanced and gleamed so beautifully that the children stood still and gazed on them.","晚霞照在明亮的宝石上，七彩斑斓，耀眼无比。孩子们纹丝不动，都看呆了。"
"“What are you standing there gaping for?” screamed the dwarf, and his ashen-gray face became scarlet with rage.","“你们傻傻地站在那里干什么？”小矮子吼道，他那张本是铁灰色的脸气得变成了古铜色。"
"He was about to go off with these angry words when a sudden growl was heard, and a black bear trotted out of the wood.","就在他不停地咒骂准备离开时，只听一声咆哮，一头黑熊从林中奔了出来。"
"The dwarf jumped up in great fright, but he hadn’t time to reach his place of retreat, for the bear was already close to him.","小矮人惶恐地跳了起来，但还没来得及撤回洞中，熊已赶到他身旁。"
"Then he cried in terror: “Dear Mr. Bear, spare me!","只见小矮人心惊胆战地哀求道：“亲爱的熊先生，饶了我吧！"
"I’ll give you all my treasure.","我把所有的财宝都给您。"
"Look at those beautiful precious stones lying there.","瞧地上这些宝石多么漂亮，"
"Spare my life! what pleasure would you get from a poor feeble little fellow like me?","饶了我吧！您不会吃我这弱不禁风的瘦骨头吧，"
"You won’t feel me between your teeth.","我还不够塞您的牙缝呢。"
"There, lay hold of these two wicked girls, they will be a tender morsel for you, as fat as young quails; eat them up, for heaven’s sake.”","快去抓住那两个可恶的臭丫头，您可以美美地吃上一顿，准有肥美鲜嫩的鹌鹑肉那么好吃！饶了我吧，去吃掉她们吧！”"
"But the bear, paying no attention to his words, gave the evil little creature one blow with his paw, and he never moved again.","熊才不听他那一套呢，劈手一掌就把这可恶的家伙击倒在地，他再也没站起来。"
"The girls had run away, but the bear called after them: “Snow-white and Rose-red, don’t be afraid; wait, and I’ll come with you.”","姐妹俩撒腿就跑，但听到那只熊在身后喊道：“雪白、玫瑰红，别害怕，等一等，我和你们一起走。”"
"Then they recognized his voice and stood still, and when the bear was quite close to them his skin suddenly fell off, and a beautiful man stood beside them, all dressed in gold.","这时，她们俩听出了这声音，于是停下来脚步。熊快走到她们跟前时，熊皮忽然脱落了，站在她们面前的是个浑身披金的帅小伙子。"
"“I am a king’s son,” he said, “and have been doomed by that unholy little dwarf, who had stolen my treasure, to roam about the woods as a wild bear till his death should set me free.","“我是一个王子，”他说道，“那个小矮子偷走了我的珠宝，并向我施了诅咒，把我变成了一头在林间乱跑的野熊，直到他死我才能得到解脱。"
"Now he has got his well-merited punishment.”","现在他已受到应有的惩罚。”"
"Snow-white married him, and Rose-red his brother, and they divided the great treasure the dwarf had collected in his cave between them.","雪白嫁给了王子，玫瑰红嫁给了王子的兄弟，他们分了小矮子聚集在洞中的大量财宝。"
"The old mother lived for many years peacefully with her children; and she carried the two rose trees with her, and they stood in front of her window, and every year they bore the finest red and white roses.","老母亲和孩子们平安幸福地在一起生活了很多年，她把那两株玫瑰树移到了她的窗前，年年他们都能欣赏到美丽无比的红玫瑰与白玫瑰。"
