"作者：马克·吐温 ","by Mark Twain"
"我13岁时曾是个很聪明的小孩——不是一般的聪明，我那时这样以为。就在那时，我第一次编了一期拙劣的报纸，但大大超乎我意料的是，这份报纸居然在社区里引起了不小的轰动。报纸确实办成功了，而我也非常引以为傲。","I was a very smart child at the age of thirteen—an unusually smart child, I thought at the time.It was then that I did my first newspaper scribbling, and most unexpectedly to me it stirred up a fine sensation in the community.It did, indeed, and I was very proud of it, too."
"当时我还是印刷厂里的“捣蛋鬼”，可我是个追求上进、抱负远大的孩子。叔叔让我进了他的报社（《汉尼拔周报》，提前预订每年仅需两美元——拥有订户五百家，全是用木柴、卷心菜和滞销的萝卜抵订金的人家）。在一个吉利的夏日，叔叔要离镇外出一周，问我能否帮他编一期像模像样的报纸。啊！我难道不想一试身手！希金斯是我们对手报社的编辑。他最近刚被人甩了。有个晚上，他的一个朋友在那可怜家伙的床上发现了一张字条，字条展开着。他在上面写道，自己再也活不下去了，要跳熊溪自尽。这位朋友急忙赶去那里，却发现希金斯正趟着水返回岸边。那朋友断定他不会寻短见了。接下来的几天，镇上都在议论此事，但希金斯却丝毫没有觉察。我认为这是个好机会。我精心撰写了一篇悲惨的报道，将整件事都写了下来，再用折合刻刀在木版底下刻了几张恶毒的插图加以说明——其中一幅是希金斯身穿衬衣，手持灯笼，用拐棍探着水的深浅，小心翼翼地踏进河里。我认为这太有趣了——没意识到发表这样一篇报道是有违道德的行径。得意于此作品，我开始寻求新的攻击目标。忽然，我灵光一闪，想到一件好玩又有趣的事，即控告邻村的报社编辑，谎称他毫无缘由地做了一件恶事，而且还“目睹了他百口莫辩的窘态”。我真的这样干了，模仿《约翰·穆尔爵士的葬礼》写了篇嘲讽文——不过仿得也不够老辣。之后，我又对两位杰出市民大肆讥讽嘲骂——他们并非罪有应得，只是因为我想把报纸编得生动传神，毕竟这是我的职责所在。随后，我又对那个新来的外乡人略微嘲讽了一番——他是时下的名人，来自昆西城衣着华丽的出色裁缝。他是个满脸假笑的头号花花公子，全州就他衣着最“花哨”。他可是一位老道的情场杀手。他每周必在本报登一首蹩脚的“情诗”，炫他的最新战利品。这周他写的诗题为《致汉—拔的玛丽》，当然指的是汉尼拔的玛丽。然而我在排版时，我突然间被一股自认为是完美的幽默感如霹雳般击穿了全身，从脚跟直达头顶。我将其浓缩成尖刻的注脚，标在下方：“这玩意儿只登一回，下不为例；我们要保持原有的风格，望J. 戈登·朗内尔斯先生见谅。如果今后戈登先生还要与他在汉—拔城的朋友们谈心的话，那他可得另辟蹊径了，谢绝再用本报专栏！”这期报纸发行了。我敢说我未曾见过哪种小事能和我那幽默的戏谑伎俩一样夺人眼球。就这一次，《汉尼拔周报》供不应求——热销盛况前所未见。全镇都轰动了。希金斯一大早便提着双杆猎枪闯进了报社。当他发现毁了他形象的不过是个娃娃（他是这么叫我的），他只拧了一下我的耳朵便离开了；不过，当晚他就辞职，永远离开了这个小镇。那个裁缝操着长柄熨斗和大剪刀找上门来；不过，他也不把我放在眼里，当晚便离镇去了南方。那两个遭我嘲讽的人来时叫嚣着要告我诽谤他人，但见我是这样一个无足轻重的人，也都愤然离去了。第二天，邻村的编辑像打仗似的呐喊着，雄赳赳气昂昂地跑来，叫嚣着要喝我的血解恨，但他最终诚挚地原谅了我，还友好地邀我去药店喝了杯“法恩斯托克牌杀虫剂”，将彼此的恩怨一笔勾销。这不过是他开的一个小玩笑。我的叔叔回来后大发雷霆——我觉得这真不合情理。想想是我让他的报纸大热大卖，再想想正因他耽于事务延迟归期，才顺利避开了一场腥风血雨，没被分尸，没被战斧砍劈，没被控告诽谤，脑袋也没被崩了——他得以保全性命，应该大大地感谢我一番才对。不过，账册过目后，他和气多了。我确实为他又争取了33名新订户，这可是笔空前未有的数目，还有那一地的蔬菜为证：那堆木柴、卷心菜、大豆和滞销的萝卜，足够他家用上两年了！","I was a printer’s “devil,” and a progressive and aspiring one.My uncle had me on his paper (the Weekly Hannibal Journal, two dollars a year in advance—five hundred subscribers, and they paid in cordwood, cabbages, and unmarketable turnips), and on a lucky summer’s day he left town to be gone a week, and asked me if I thought I could edit one issue of the paper judiciously.Ah! didn’t I want to try!Higgins was the editor on the rival paper.He had lately been jilted, and one night a friend found an open note on the poor fellow’s bed, in which he stated that he could not longer endure life and had drowned himself in Bear Creek.The friend ran down there and discovered Higgins wading back to shore.He had concluded he wouldn’t.The village was full of it for several days, but Higgins did not suspect it.I thought this was a fine opportunity.I wrote an elaborately wretched account of the whole matter, and then illustrated it with villainous cuts engraved on the bottoms of wooden type with a jackknife—one of them a picture of Higgins wading out into the creek in his shirt, with a lantern, sounding the depth of the water with a walking-stick.I thought it was desperately funny, and was densely unconscious that there was any moral obliquity about such a publication.Being satisfied with this effort I looked around for other worlds to conquer, and it struck me that it would make good, interesting matter to charge the editor of a neighboring country paper with a piece of gratuitous rascality and “see him squirm.”I did it, putting the article into the form of a parody on the “Burial of Sir John Moore”—and a pretty crude parody it was, too.Then I lampooned two prominent citizens outrageously—not because they had done anything to deserve, but merely because I thought it was my duty to make the paper lively.Next I gently touched up the newest stranger—the lion of the day, the gorgeous journeyman tailor from Quincy.He was a simpering coxcomb of the first water, and the “loudest” dressed man in the state.He was an inveterate woman-killer.Every week he wrote lushy “poetry” for the journal, about his newest conquest.His rhymes for my week were headed, “To MARY IN H—l,” meaning to Mary in Hannibal, of course.But while setting up the piece I was suddenly riven from head to heel by what I regarded as a perfect thunderbolt of humor, and I compressed it into a snappy footnote at the bottom—thus: “We will let this thing pass, just this once;  but we wish Mr. J. Gordon Runnels to understand distinctly that we have a character to sustain, and from this time forth when he wants to commune with his friends in h—l, he must select some other medium than the columns of this journal!”The paper came out, and I never knew any little thing attract so much attention as those playful trifles of mine.For once the Hannibal Journal was in demand—a novelty it had not experienced before.The whole town was stirred.Higgins dropped in with a double-barreled shotgun early in the forenoon.When he found that it was an infant (as he called me) that had done him the damage, he simply pulled my ears and went away; but he threw up his situation that night and left town for good.The tailor came with his goose and a pair of shears; but he despised me, too, and departed for the South that night.The two lampooned citizens came with threats of libel, and went away incensed at my insignificance.The country editor pranced in with a war-whoop next day, suffering for blood to drink; but he ended by forgiving me cordially and inviting me down to the drug store to wash away all animosity in a friendly bumper of “Fahnestock’s Vermifuge.”It was his little joke.My uncle was very angry when he got back—unreasonably so, I thought, considering what an impetus I had given the paper, and considering also that gratitude for his preservation ought to have been uppermost in his mind, inasmuch as by his delay he had so wonderfully escaped dissection, tomahawking, libel, and getting his head shot off.But he softened when he looked at the accounts and saw that I had actually booked the unparalleled number of thirty-three new subscribers, and had the vegetables to show for it, cordwood, cabbage, beans, and unsalable turnips enough to run the family for two years!"
