"墙上的那些画","Pictures on the Walls"
"作者：D. H. 劳伦斯","by D. H. Lawrence"
"墙上挂的画是不是家庭室内装饰必不可少的一部分，这个问题在人们看来似乎是有争议的。然而，由于千百个家庭中鲜有一家不挂画，我们也许可以轻松地得出结论，在墙上挂画是家庭室内装修必不可少的一部分，尽管有些势利的人假装声称他们更喜欢空白的墙壁。人类喜欢画。不管是野蛮人还是文明人，我们都一样，只要有一幅画摆在那儿，我们就会径直过去看看。如果能买得起的话，我们当中很少有人不喜欢在房间里挂上一幅极其迷人的作品，可以不断地观赏。但不幸的是，一般来说，我们只有那些过去留下来的平庸的画，我们把它们挂在墙上，只是因为既然有这些东西，我们就得把它们安放到某个地方。要是人们能对此持坚定的态度，毫不留情地将所有无足轻重的图画连同画框一起烧掉，我们在室内的呼吸该自由得多。要是人们每隔十年便在墙壁周围逛一圈该多好，并且问道，好，那幅油画怎么样？那件复制品怎样？那张照片又怎样呢？它们有何意义？我们从它们那儿得到了什么？它们有什么意义吗？它们值得收藏吗？——回答几乎总会是否定的。那么然后呢？我们要不要说，哦，就让它们呆在那儿吧！它们都在那儿呆了十年了，我们还是把它们留在那儿别动了。——但是，这纯粹是一种惰性，会扼杀家里的一切生气。一个女人可能会这样说，这顶帽子我都戴了一年了，因此不妨再多戴几年——一座房子，一个家，只是一件更大的衣物罢了，就像我们觉得自己必须换新衣服，我们也应该翻新自己的家，把家打理好。仅靠春季的大扫除是不够的。为什么服装的时尚要不断变换？因为我们自己在时间缓慢的变化中发生改变，真的是这样。如果我们想象一下自己现在还穿着六年前穿过的衣服，就会发现那是不可能的。在某种程度上，我们已经不同于以前了，我们的衣服则表现出我们不同以往的性格。","Whether wall pictures are or are not an essential part of interior decoration in the home seems to be considered debatable.Yet since there is scarcely one house in a thousand which doesn’t have them, we may easily conclude that they are, in spite of the snobbism which pretends to prefer blank walls.The human race loves pictures.Barbarians or civilized, we are all alike, we straightway go to look at a picture if there is a picture to look at.And there are very few of us who wouldn’t love to have a perfectly fascinating work hanging in our room, that we could go on looking at, if we could afford it.Instead, unfortunately, as a rule we have only some mediocre thing left over from the past, that hangs on the wall just because we’ve got it, and it must go somewhere.If only people would be firm about it, and rigorously burn all insignificant pictures, frames as well, how much more freely we should breathe indoors.If only people would go round their walls every ten years and say, Now, what about that oil-painting, what about that reproduction, what about that photograph?What do they mean?What do we get from them?Have they any point?Are they worth keeping?—The answer would almost invariably be No.And then what?Shall we say, Oh, let them stay!They’ve been there ten years, we might as well leave them!—But that is sheer inertia and death to any freshness in the home.A woman might as well say: I’ve worn this hat for a year, so I may as well go on wearing it for a few more years—A house, home, is only a greater garment, and just as we feel we must renew our clothes and have fresh ones, so we should renew our homes and make them in keeping.Spring cleaning isn’t enough.Why do fashions in clothes change?Because, really, we ourselves change, in the slow metamorphosis of time.If we imagine ourselves now in the clothes we wore six years ago, we shall see that it is impossible.We are, in some way, different persons now, and our clothes express our different personality."
"家也应该这样。它应该随着我们的改变而改变。但它没有我们的衣服变化得快，因为家与我们的联系没有那么紧密。虽然更缓慢，但是在家里，我们周遭的一切还是必然要改变的。房间里更具装饰性的物品变化得更快一些，像是图画、窗帘或靠垫，比较重实的家具改变得要慢一些。一些家具可能让我们终生满意。一些家具可能过了十年就不合适了。但可以确定的是，靠垫、窗帘和图画在几年后就会变得陈旧。家里的陈旧气息令人感到窒息，会使人精神压抑。女人应该要注意这些。尤其是在英国，我们很多时间都在室内度过，所以我们的室内环境必须要有生机，必须改变，必须要定期除旧迎新，必须要随着我们这些年的变化而变化，以搭配我们新的情绪、新的感觉和新的自我。家中的死气沉沉、乏味单调、一成不变实则体现出一种惰性，对人的现代性非常有害。人的现代性处于一种不稳定的状态，对周围环境非常敏感，远远超过我们所了解的。","And so should the home.It should change with us, as we change.Not so quickly as our clothes change, because it is not so close in contact.More slowly, but just as inevitably, the home should change around us.And the change should be more rapid in the more decorative scheme of the room: pictures, curtains, cushions; and slower in the solid furniture.Some furniture may satisfy us for a lifetime.Some may be quite unsuitable after ten years.But certain it is that the cushions and curtains and pictures will begin to be stale after a couple of years.And staleness in the home is stifling and oppressive to the spirit.It is a woman’s business to see to it.In England especially we live so much indoors that our interiors must live, must change, must have their seasons of fading and renewing, must come alive to fit the new moods, the new sensations, the new selves that come to pass in us with the changing years.Dead and dull permanency in the home, dreary sameness, is a form of inertia, is very harmful to the modern nature, which is in a state of flux, sensitive to its surroundings far more than we really know."
"就像我们一样，房间里挂的画在某种程度上对房间里的氛围起着关键作用。在房间里挂上灰色的凹版照片，空气里就会充斥着某种灰色基调，即使你的靠垫上绘着水仙花也无济于事。挂上巴克斯特的版画，在一段时间内会给你带来美感，随之而来的便是一种窒息感。图画是奇怪的东西。大多数图画无疑都会像花一样死去，一旦死去，它们挂在墙上就像褐色的、枯萎了的花束一样陈腐。其中的原因在于我们自己。我们因为喜欢某幅画才会买它，于是这幅画对我们内在活生生的感受作出了直接的回应。但感受会发生变化，或快或慢。如果我们对画的感觉是肤浅的，那么这感觉很快就会消失——于是这画很快就变得微不足道，无异于挂在墙上的一块毫无生机的破布。反过来，如果我们能看得更深刻一些，我们会买一幅至少可以挂上一两年而不让人生厌的画，并且就像鲜花一样，它能时刻给我们带来一种新鲜的愉悦感。我们甚至可能找到可以伴随我们一生的作品。如果我们找到了一幅杰作，它将会千古留芳。但是，这个世界上任何一种杰作都不多见。","And, do as we may, the pictures in a room are in some way the key to the atmosphere of a room.Put up grey photogravures, and a certain greyness will dominate in the air, no matter if your cushions be daffodils.Put up Baxter prints, and for a time you will have charm; after that, a certain stuffiness will ensue.Pictures are strange things.Most of them die as sure as flowers die, and, once dead, they hang on the wall as stale as brown withered bouquets.The reason lies in ourselves.When we buy a picture because we like it, then the picture responds fresh to some living feeling in us.But feelings change: quicker or slower.If our feeling for the picture was superficial, it wears away quickly—and quickly the picture is nothing but a dead rag hanging on the wall.On the other hand, if we can see a little deeper, we shall buy a picture that will at least last us a year or two, and give a certain fresh joy all the time, like a living flower.We may even find something that will last us a lifetime.If we found a masterpiece, it would last many lifetimes.But there are not many masterpieces of any sort in this world."
"事实依然是有各种各样的画，也有各种各样的人喜欢这些画；只是这种喜欢所持续的时间也许是有限的，即使一幅杰作也有失宠的一天。拉斐尔的作品在几个世纪后的今天，偶尔会令人生厌，米开朗基罗的作品也开始让人腻烦了。","The fact remains there are pictures of every sort, and people of every sort to be pleased by them; and there is, perhaps, a limit to the length of time that even a masterpiece will please mankind.Raphael now occasionally bores us, after several centuries, and Michael Angelo begins to."
"但我们无需为拉斐尔或米开朗基罗操心，他们的作品能在很多个世纪内保有新鲜的吸引力。我们关心的是那些过了半年就可能会变成毫无生气的破布、人们对它们所有的新鲜感都丧失殆尽的画。如果我们想想兰西尔或阿尔玛·塔德玛，我们就会发现，即使那些传统的鉴赏家，比如德文郡的公爵们，他们花了大笔的钱，买的也只不过是在短时间内可称得上杰作的画，如今这些画就像死气沉沉、荒诞可笑的破布一样挂在公爵住所的墙上。如今，对于兰西尔画的那幅有两条狗、名为《威严与放肆》的画，只有非常没有素养的人才会将其挂在客厅的墙上。然而，在当时那个年代，这两条狗无比招人喜爱。人们对这幅画的兴趣持续了大概二十年。但20年之后，还把这些画挂在查茨沃思庄园的墙上或是挂在别的什么地方，那就成了一件丢脸的事。它们无疑应该被烧掉。无论挂在哪儿，这些画只会带来让人难以忍受的窒闷感，还会提醒我们意识到自己的品位是多么低下。","But we needn’t bother about Raphael or Michael Angelo, who keep up their fresh interest for centuries.Our concern is rather with pictures that may be dead rags in six months, all the fresh feeling for them gone.If we think of Landseer, or Alma Tadema, we see how even traditional connoisseurs like Dukes of Devonshire paid large sums for momentary masterpieces that now hang on the ducal walls as dead and ridiculous rags.Only a very uneducated person nowadays would want to put those two Landseer dogs, “Dignity and Impudence”, on the drawing-room wall.Yet they pleased immensely in their day.And the interest was sustained, perhaps, for twenty years.But after twenty years it has become a humiliation to keep them hanging on the walls of Chatsworth or wherever they hang.They should be burnt, of course.They only make an intolerable stuffiness wherever they are, and remind us of the shallowness of our taste."
"如果说《威严与放肆》或是米莱的《气泡》这些运用了大量绘画技巧的作品尚且如此的话，那些没有任何技术含量的廉价凹版相片就更是如此了。图画一旦被人们所熟识，便失去了魅力。自从惠斯勒为他母亲画的肖像画被用作广告后，这幅作品就丢失了大半的魅力。对大多数人来说，它已经变成了一幅破旧的画，一块毫无生气的破布。一幅画一旦到了非常受欢迎的阶段，接下来就会在陈腐中死亡，永远无法复活。它就这么永远地死了。唯一能做的就是把它烧掉。","And if this is true of “Dignity and Impudence” or Millais’ “Bubbles”, which have a great deal of technical skill in them, how much more true is it of cheap photogravures, which have none.Familiarity wears a picture out.Since Whistler’s portrait of his mother was used for advertisement, it has lost most of its appeal, and become for most people a worn-out picture, a dead rag.And once a picture has been really popular, and then died into staleness, it never revives again.It is dead for ever.The only thing is to burn it."
"这样的处理方式也非常适用于那些凹版相片和其他诸如此类用机器制造的图画。这样的画或许在20年前曾令年轻的新娘着迷。它们甚至可能在之后的半年或两年内仍然令她着迷。但这段时间一过，这些画差不多就死了，而新娘从这些画中所得到的乐趣也仅仅是一种怀旧和伤感之情，抑或是把它们看作财产而产生的庸俗的满足感。把画看成财产可真是要命。画就像鲜花一样，迟早都要凋谢并死去，必须得扔到垃圾桶里烧掉。所有的画都是这样。即使是受人喜爱的乔尔乔内，终有一天会失宠——但在几乎五个世纪后的今天，他的作品还是非常招人喜爱，仍然像朵鲜花一样。但当他的作品最终死去的时候，就像尊贵的墙上挂着的许多画一样，我们希望它被烧掉算了。希望他的作品不要再被看作是值钱的财产了，就像人们现在还认为许多僵死的画布还值一大笔钱那样。","Which applies very forcibly to photogravures and other such machine pictures.They may have fascinated the young bride twenty years ago.They may even have gone on fascinating her for six months or two years.But at the end of that time they are almost certainly dead, and the bride’s pleasure in them can only be a reminiscent sentimental pleasure, or that rather vulgar satisfaction in them as pieces of property.It is fatal to look on pictures as pieces of property.Pictures are like flowers, that fade away sooner or later, and die, and must be thrown in the dustbin and burnt.It is true of all pictures.Even the beloved Giorgione will one day die to human interest—but he is still very lovely, after almost five centuries, still a fresh flower.But when at last he is dead, as so many pictures are that hang on honoured walls, let us hope he will be burnt.Let us hope he won’t still be regarded as a piece of valuable property, worth huge sums, like lots of dead-as-doornails canvases today."
"要是我们能在艺术中摒弃“财产”的概念就好了！艺术之所以存在，是要给我们带来乐趣或欢愉的。一个黄色靠垫让我们感到快乐。一旦这种感觉没了，把它拿走，处理掉，再换上另外一个——我们这么做了，所以靠垫总会保持新鲜、有趣，生产厂家也会不断地生产新鲜、迷人的织物。自然的需求会导致良性的供应。","If only we could get rid of the idea of “property” in the arts!The arts exist to give us pleasure or joy.A yellow cushion gives us pleasure.The moment it ceases to do so, take it away, have done with it, give us another—Which we do, and so cushions remain fresh and interesting, and the manufacturers manufacture continually new, fresh, fascinating fabrics.The natural demand causes a healthy supply."
"在绘画方面，情形却恰恰相反。一幅图画，不但没有人认为它像鲜花或靠垫那样必须保持新鲜、芳香、有吸引力，反而将其看作一件有形的财产。我们可能花10先令买了一束玫瑰花，花束枯萎后我们直接扔掉，不会去想我们扔了10先令。我们可能花两几尼给可爱的靠垫配一层套，一旦用旧了就把它扒下来扔掉，根本不会心疼那两几尼。我们清楚自己的所作所为。我们花钱为的是审美享受，并且也得到了。幸运的是，钱可以买到玫瑰或可人的刺绣——可如果我们花两英镑买了一幅画，一年后对它感到腻烦，我们也不会烧掉它，就像我们不会放火烧房子一样。这是我们无知的愚蠢之举。我们应该烧掉那幅画，然后我们才能从另一幅画中获得真正的新的满足，正如从鲜花和新靠垫中获得的一样。每所学校都会教育学生：不要把枯萎的花留在花瓶里。把它们扔掉！——因此，也应该教育学生这一点：不要把陈旧的画留在墙上。把它们烧掉！一幅画的价值在于它带给人们美的感受，正如一朵鲜花一样。美的感受一旦消失，这幅画就成了令人生厌的垃圾。","In pictures it is just the opposite.A picture, instead of being regarded, like a flower or a cushion, as something that must be fresh and fragrant with attraction, is looked on as solid property.We may spend ten shillings on a bunch of roses, and throw away the dead stalks without thinking we have thrown away ten shillings.We may spend two guineas on the cover of a lovely cushion, and strip it off and discard it the moment it is stale, without for a moment lamenting the two guineas.We know where we are.We paid for aesthetic pleasure, and we have had it.Lucky for us that money can buy roses or lovely embroidery—Yet if we pay two pounds for some picture, and are tired of it after a year, we can no more burn that picture than we can set the house on fire.It is uneducated folly on our part.We ought to burn the picture, so that we can have real fresh pleasure in a different one, in fresh flowers and fresh cushions.In every school it is taught: Never leave stale flowers in a vase.Throw them away!—So it should be taught: Never leave stale pictures on the wall.Burn them!The value of a picture lies in the aesthetic emotion it brings, exactly as if it were a flower.The aesthetic emotion dead, the picture is a piece of ugly litter."
"这就和“图画应该属于整体建筑的一部分，和房间融为一体”这一老生常谈不相符了。这种说法是谬论。图画是装饰，不是建筑的一部分。房屋之所以存在，是为我们提供遮蔽和住所；图画之所以存在，是给我们带来快乐以及某种情感的。当然，图画和房屋的整体环境可能相称，也可能不相称。但是世界上的任何一间屋子，你都可以在不同的时间，采用几十种复杂的装饰方案，与每个方案相称的不同图画可以找到几百幅。图画要融入建筑的理论是完全错误的。房屋里的一幅画就好比我衣服扣眼里的一朵栀子花。如果当初裁缝把一朵栀子花永久地“融入”我晨服的扣眼里，不能拆除，我肯定受不了。","Which belies the tedious dictum that a picture should be part of the architectural whole, built into the room, as it were.This is fallacy.A picture is decoration, not architecture.The room exists to shelter and house us, the picture exists to please us, to give us certain emotions.Of course, there can be harmony or disharmony between the pictures and the whole ensemble of a room.But in any room in the world you could carry out dozens of difficult schemes of decoration, at different times, and to harmonize with each scheme of decoration there are hundreds of different pictures.The built-in theory is all wrong.A picture in a room is the gardenia in my buttonhole.If the tailor “built” a permanent and irremovable gardenia in my morning-coat buttonhole, I should be done in."
"还有一个年轻的学派认为，绘画应该像图书馆里的图书一样，堆放在一起保存，一次看上半小时左右，就像我们翻阅一本绘画作品集一样。但是，这就再一次完全忽视了绘画真正的内在意义。确实，大量的垃圾绘画看上半个小时就差不多了。那么，为什么还要把它们堆放着保存起来呢？还用得着保存吗？另一方面，如果我有一幅雷诺阿画的裸体画，或是弗里埃斯的一幅漂亮的鲜花习作，抑或是布拉巴宗的一幅水彩画，我会愿意将它们保存个一两年，挂在选好的地方，与它们共同生活，享受其芬芳。                 如果我得到收藏于普拉多美术馆的提香作品《亚当和夏娃》，我愿意把它挂在自己的房间里一辈子，以供欣赏。因为我知道，它会在我的一生中给我带来微妙的欣喜，令我生活愉快。如果我有毕加索的作品，我会想保存半年左右，如果是布拉克的作品，我愿意保存一年左右。之后，我可能就会感到厌烦了。但要是罗姆尼的作品，我一天也不想保留。","Then there is the young school which thinks pictures should be kept in stacks like books in a library, and looked at for half an hour or so at a time, as we turn over the leaves of a book of reproductions.But this again entirely disregards the real psychology of pictures.It is true the great trashy mass of pictures are exhausted in half an hour.But then why keep them in a stack, why keep them at all?On the other hand, if I had a Renoir nude, or a good Friesz flower-study, or even a Brabazon water-colour, I should want to keep it at least a year or two, and hang it up in a chosen place, to live with it and get all the fragrance out of it.And if I had the Titian “Adam and Eve”, from the Prado, I should want to have it hanging in my room all my life, to look at: because I know it would give me a subtle rejoicing all my life, and would make my life delightful.And if I had Picassos I should want to keep them about six months, and Braques I should like to have for about a year: then, probably, I should be through with them.But I would not want a Romney even for a day."
"因此，对不同的个人或绘画来说，情况是不一样的，本来就应该不一样。但目前的情况是不能不一样。我们都不得不去看父母挂在墙上的那些死气沉沉的破布，仅仅因为它们是财产。","And so it varies, with the individual and with the picture, and so it should be allowed to vary.But at present it is not allowed to vary.We all have to stare at the dead rags our fathers and mothers hung on the walls, just because they are property."
"不过让我们来改变这种情况吧。让我们别让家里那些布满灰尘、毫无价值、死气沉沉的画充斥我们的视野。将那些僵死的“艺术”付之一炬吧，把画布、画纸、油彩、水彩、照片和所有的一切都当作祭品焚毁吧，来一次彻底的清理。","But let us change it.Let us refuse to have our vision filled with dust and nullity of dead pictures in the home.Let there be a grand conflagration of dead “art”, immolation of canvas and paper, oil-colours, water-colours, photographs and all, a grand clearance."
"然后怎样呢？那去问问哈罗德百货商店吧。看在上帝的分上，不要花20几尼再去买一幅画，然后挂在墙上直到最后时刻，仅仅因为它是你花了20几尼买来的。去哈罗德百货商店问问，他们有没有租画的服务。他们有个收费租书的图书馆——或者其他人有——规模很大。人们把书租出来，直到吸收了所有的内容再归还。为什么不做类似的绘画出租呢？","Then what?Then ask Harrods about it.Don’t for heaven’s sake go and spend twenty guineas on another picture that will have to hang on the wall till the end of time just because it cost twenty guineas.Go to Harrods and ask them what about their Circulating Picture scheme.They have a circulating library—or other people have—huge circulating libraries.People hire books till they have assimilated their content.Why not the same with pictures?"
"为什么哈罗德商店不开一个大规模的图画“馆”？为什么不开一家可供人观画、选画的“绘画馆”？那里应该由懂画的人专门负责，就像图书管理员很了解书籍一样。我们可以预订，交点儿保证金，我们要的画就送到家里来了。我们可以按自己的意愿，挂上一年、两年或是十年，不管怎样，直到我们享受完所有的乐趣，想要再换一幅时才归还。","Why should not Harrods have a great “library” of pictures?Why not have a great “picturay”, where we can go and choose a picture?There would be men in charge who knew about pictures, just as librarians know about books.We subscribe, we pay a certain deposit, and our pictures are sent home to us, to keep for one year, for two, for ten, as we wish: at any rate, till we have got all the joy out of them, and want a change."
"在绘画馆里，各种画应有尽有，唯独没有那些不值得保留的、机器制造的垃圾图画。这里为你提供了大量的现代艺术作品，是艺术家们刚刚脱手的，有蚀刻版画、雕刻版画、素描、油画；你还可以得到可爱的全新彩色复制品，这是大多数人都买不起的；你还可以得到与之匹配的画框。在这里，你可以选择，选择当下可以给你带来真正快乐、暂时适合你房间的画。","In the pictuary you can have everything except machine-made rubbish that is not worth having.You can have big supplies of modern art, fresh from the artists, etchings, engravings, drawings, paintings, you can have the lovely new colour reproductions that most of us can’t afford to buy; you can have frames to suit.And here you can choose, choose what will give you real joy and will suit your home for the time being."
"在任何时代，伟大的艺术家都是寥寥无几。但是，有真正的艺术天分和良好的艺术感觉的男男女女却有成百上千个，他们创作的绘画很可爱却不为人知。这些作品很可爱——但并不是不朽的，也非杰作，也称不上“伟大”，可它们就是可爱，也会在几年内保持这份可爱，之后它们会死去，那也就到了该毁掉它们的时候了。","There are few, very few great artists in any age.But there are hundreds and hundreds of men and women with genuine artistic talent and beautiful artistic feeling, who produce quite lovely works that are never seen.They are lovely works—not immortal, not masterpieces, not “great”, yet they are lovely, and will keep their loveliness a certain number of years; after which they will die, and the time will have come to destroy them."
"而如今所有这些有着短暂魅力的画却被提前扔到了垃圾堆里，真是件可悲的事。就是这样。当代艺术属于当代社会。社会总的来说需要当代人的画，就像需要当代人写的书一样。现代人读现代的书。但他们家里挂着的画却不属于任何时代，没有一点儿生命力，没有任何意义，仅仅是墙上僵死的斑点而已。","Now it is a tragedy that all these pictures with their temporary loveliness should be condemned to a premature dust-heap.For that is what they are.Contemporary art belongs to contemporary society.Society at large needs the pictures of its contemporaries, just as it needs the books.Modern people read modern books.But they hang up pictures that belong to no age whatever, and have no life, and have no meaning, are mere blotches of deadness on the walls."
"充满生命力的时刻才是最重要的。而这样的时刻我们从来没有在绘画中体验过。让大众去“看”马蒂斯、毕加索或布拉克是没用的。无论怎样，他们看到的都只是一块怪异、恐怖的画布。可当代民众阅读詹姆斯·乔伊斯或马塞尔·普鲁斯特的作品吗？不读。他们读大量更贴近自己、更容易理解的当代作品。因此，当代民众对于现代图书总体发展的认识，或多或少是与时俱进、贴近现实的。他们对当下的文学有一定的意识，在这方面比较清醒，也比较明智。","The living moment is everything.And in pictures we never experience it.It is useless asking the public to “see” Matisse or Picasso or Braque.They will never see more than an odd horrific canvas, anyhow.But does the modern public read James Joyce or Marcel Proust?It does not.It reads the great host of more congenial and more intelligible contemporary writers.And so the modern public is more or less up-to-date and on the spot about the general run of modern books.It is conscious of the literature of its day, moderately awake and intelligent in that respect."
"但说到当下的绘画和素描，他们的意识完全空白。普通大众觉得自己在现代艺术作品面前无知得不可救药。他们对整个不自然的现代艺术完全不了解，便干脆采取了敌对态度。即使那些抱着试试看的心态而被吸引了的人们，也还是感到不安，绝对不敢购买。价格相对来说比较高，而且很容易就会被骗，买到赝品。因此，一切也就陷入僵局了。","But of the pictures and drawings of its day it is blankly unaware.The general public feels itself a hopeless ignoramus when confronted with modern works of art.It has no clue to the whole unnatural business of modern art, and is just hostile.Even those who are tentatively attracted are uneasy, and they dare never buy.Prices are comparatively high, and you may so easily be let in for a dud.So the whole thing is a deadlock."
"现在，唯一一个可以让大众接触艺术的途径就是让他们拥有艺术品。这跟书籍的道理是一样的。在过去一本书需要五几尼或两几尼的年代，除了乡绅阶级，文学作品没有其他受众。伴随着借阅图书馆的出现，庞大的阅读群体也形成了。那么，有了可外借的绘画馆，庞大的绘画爱好者群体也将随之出现。大众迫切需要绘画。可他们就是买不起。","Now the only way to keep the public in touch with art is to let it get hold of works of art.It was just the same with books.In the old five-guinea and two-guinea days there was no public for literature, except the squire class.The great reading public came into being with the lending library.And the great picture-loving public would come into being with the lending pictuary.The public wants pictures hard enough.But it simply can’t get them."
"只要绘画还被看作财产，而不是像鲜花一样，是美感和纯粹快乐的来源，这种状况就还会继续下去。大众曾经极度缺乏与书籍的接触，直到书籍不再被当成一堆堆不动产，而是被看作某种属于心灵和意识的东西，一种精神财富，而非庸俗的物质财产。今天，如果我说“道蒂的《阿拉伯沙漠旅行》是我最喜欢的一本书”，同我交谈的这人不会回答：“是的，我有一本”，他会说：“是的，我读过”。如果是在18世纪，这人有可能会回答：“我的书房里有一本精美的对开本”，于是这种“财产”情结就会淹没文学本身所带来的任何愉悦。","And this will continue so long as a picture is regarded as a piece of property, and not as a source of aesthetic emotion, of sheer pleasure, as a flower is.The great public was utterly deprived of books till books ceased to be looked on as lumps of real estate, and came to be regarded as something belonging to the mind and consciousness, a spiritual instead of a gross material property.Today, if I say: “Doughty’s ‘Arabia Deserta’ is a favourite book of mine,” then the man I say it to won’t reply: “Yes, I own a copy,” he will say: “Yes, I have read it.”In the eighteenth century he would probably have replied: “I have a fine example in folio in my library,” and the sense of “property” would have overwhelmed any sense of literary delight."
"图书价格的降低使得人们不再把它们当作庸俗的财产，从而释放出了其真正的精神价值。绘画也必须经历这样的过程。大众迫切想得到、也需要得到所有可以获得的、真正的审美刺激。他们明白这一点。当图书变得普及时，广大的读者群几乎一下子就涌现了出来。而一旦普通大众个人可以接触到绘画，广大绘画爱好者的群体也会随之产生。","The cheapening of books freed them from the gross property valuation and released their true spiritual value.Something of the same must happen for pictures.The public wants and needs badly all the real aesthetic stimulus it can get.And it knows it.When books were made available, the vast reading public sprang into being almost at once.And a vast picture-loving public would arise, once the public could get at the pictures, personally."
"有成千上万幅非常好看的画，当然尚算不上杰作，但具有真正的美感，它们属于当今这个时代，但却无望地堆放在艺术家画室的角落里，落满灰尘，渐渐陈腐。这真是一大憾事。大众需要这些画，但从来没机会看到它们，即使偶尔看到一两幅，他们也不敢买，尤其是“艺术”从来都是高价的，大众感到无力判断。与此同时，当今闷闷不乐、作品积压的艺术家们最希望的就是公众购买他们的作品。我们相信，这些作品对于现代人的心灵教育和情感体验是必不可少的。成年人有必要了解这些绘画，就像他们了解现代图书一样。儿童在他们连续的创作过程中，有必要熟悉这些绘画。正因为我们的审美教育被严重地忽视了，所以它才变得极其重要。","There are thousands of quite lovely pictures, not masterpieces, of course, but with real beauty, which belong to today, and which remain stacked dustily and hopelessly in corners of artists’ studios, going stale.It is a great shame.The public wants them, but it never sees them; and if it does see an occasional few, it daren’t buy, especially as “art” is high-priced, for it feels incompetent to judge.At the same time, the unhappy, work-glutted artists of today want above all things to let the public have their works.And these works are, we insist, an essential part of the education and emotional experience of the modern mind.It is necessary that adults should know them, as they know modern books.It is necessary that children be familiar with them, in the constant stream of creation.Our aesthetic education is become immensely important, since it is so immensely neglected."
"于是就这样，绘画渐渐陈旧，因为它们和书籍、鲜花或者丝绸一样，过一段时间就无法保持新鲜了。而如今，绘画的新鲜感对于我们就像呼吸一般不可或缺，因为它意味着几小时乃至几天的愉悦心情。大众非常渴望绘画，却不敢购买，因为他们有一种金钱—财产情结。而艺术家非常渴望大众购买这些绘画，却不敢让自己跌价。于是出现了僵局，简直让人泄气。","And there we are, the pictures going to dust, for they don’t keep their freshness, any more than books or flowers or silks, beyond a certain time; yet their freshness now is the breath of life to us, since it means hours and days of delight.And the public is pining for the pictures, but daren’t buy, because of the money-property complex.And the artist is pining to let the public have them, but daren’t make himself cheap.And so the thing is an impasse, simple state of frustration."
"现在，再来说说哈罗德商店里的先生们和他们的现代艺术品外借馆——或者说绘画馆。或者，更好的说法是艺术家合作社，旨在为大众提供可以租赁或购买的绘画作品。如今，没有人会买画，除非为了投机。要是一个人花100英镑买一幅画，他暗地里应该是认为，几年之后这幅画会值1000英镑。","Now for Messrs. Harrods and their lending library—or pictuary—of modern works of art.Or, better still, an Artists’ Co-operative Society to supply pictures on loan or purchase, to the great public.Today nobody buys pictures, except as speculation.If a man pays a hundred pounds for a canvas, he does it in the secret belief that the canvas will be worth a thousand pounds in a few years’ time."
"这种态度让人生厌。读书的大众仅仅期望一本书要有趣，他们压根不在乎这本书五年后是否被认为是本很棒的书。大众想要娱乐，有时是要快乐，文学的存在满足了这种需求。现在，即使是一幅无足轻重的画都能给人们带来极大的快乐，这样的画家有着细腻的艺术感知力和绘画技巧，即使他不具有那么非凡的原创性。有成百上千幅默默无闻的绘画堆在画室的角落里，而我知道，这些画如果在我的房间里挂上一年，会给我带来真正的快乐。过一段时间，它们会变旧，但也不像花瓶里的那束丁香花一样凋谢得那么快，但这并不妨碍我喜欢那束花，还乐呵呵地把它摆在桌上。就像大树把自身的美转移到花朵上，而花朵不久就会凋零，所有无名的艺术家们用不同的方式把美和快乐融入他们的画中，这些画也同样无法超越生命的极限。然而，几乎所有这些有着些许美感、能够给人带来快乐的绘画，竟然被人从画架上拿下来扔到了垃圾堆中，而对美极其渴求的大众却连看它们一眼的机会都没有，这真是大大的遗憾、可怕的浪费。说大众应该购买，这话不错。一幅画卖20英镑算是便宜的，10英镑算是非常便宜，5英镑的话就算“白给”了。大众不仅仅是心怀顾忌，他们有一种情结，害怕自己买的画连最终变成价格不菲的杰作的可能性都没有。","The whole attitude is disgusting.The reading public only asks of a book that it shall be entertaining, it doesn’t give a hang as to whether the book will be considered a great book five years hence.The great public wants to be entertained and, sometimes, delighted, and literature exists to supply the demand.Now there is a great deal of delight in even a very minor picture, produced by an artist who has delicate artistic feeling and some skill, even if he be not wildly original.There are hundreds and hundreds of perfectly obscure pictures stuck away in corners of studios, which would, I know, give me a real delight if they were hung in my room for a year.After a while they would go stale; but not nearly as quickly as a bunch of lilac, which yet I love and set with pleasure on the table.As a tree puts beauty into a flower that will fade, so all the hosts of minor artists, one way and another, put beauty and delight into their pictures, that likewise will not last beyond their rhythmic season.But it is a wicked shame and waste that nearly all these pictures, with their modicum of beauty and their power of giving delight, should just be taken from the easel to be laid on the dust-heap, while a beauty-starved public doesn’t even get a look at them.It is all very well saying the public should buy.A picture is cheap at twenty pounds, and very cheap at ten pounds, and “given away” at five pounds.And the public is not only shy, it has a complex about buying any picture that hasn’t at least the chance of turning out a masterpiece of ultimate extraordinary value."
"这些都是毫无意义、徒劳无用的。唯一的办法就是让那些没什么名气的艺术家们聚集起来，组成一个艺术家合作社，运用合理的商业智慧和精力，为大众提供他们想要的绘画。或者让世界上那些精明的商人来接管此事，把它做成一个盈利的行当，就像书商把出书做成了盈利的行当一样。","It is all nonsensical and futile.The only way now is for the hosts of small artists to club together and form an Artists’ Co-operative Society, with proper business intelligence and business energy, to supply the public with pictures on the public’s own terms.Or for the shrewd business men of the world to take the matter up and make a profitable concern of it, as publishers made a profitable concern of publishing books."
