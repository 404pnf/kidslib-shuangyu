"作者：杰克·伦敦","by Jack London"
"“现在我醒来去工作；上帝保佑我别懒惰。如果天黑前我已死去，上帝保佑我的活儿没问题。阿门。”","“Now I wake me up to work;I pray the Lord I may not shirk.If I should die before the night,I pray the Lord my work’s all right.Amen.”"
"“约翰尼，你要再不起床，我就一点儿吃的也不给你了！”","“If you don’t git up, Johnny, I won’t give you a bite to eat!”"
"这种威胁对这个男孩子已经没有效果了。他依旧固执地睡着，为忘乎所以的沉睡而战，就像一个做梦者为了捍卫自己的梦而战一样。男孩的双手松松地握着，在空中无力地、间歇性地空打了几下子。这几下子本来是对着他母亲的，但是他母亲表现得训练有素，竟熟练地避开了，同时还用力地摇着他的肩膀。“别动我！”","The threat had no effect on the boy.He clung stubbornly to sleep, fighting for its oblivion as the dreamer fights for his dream.The boy’s hands loosely clenched themselves, and he made feeble, spasmodic blows at the air.These blows were intended for his mother, but she betrayed practised familiarity in avoiding them as she shook him roughly by the shoulder.“Lemme ’lone!”"
"这一叫喊声刚开始时是沉睡中的低声嘟囔，接着很快提高了声调，变成了激烈的反抗，像是一声哀号，最后渐渐停息，低沉下去，变成了含糊不清的呜咽。这声音简直就像野兽的嚎叫一样，正如一个受尽折磨的灵魂，充满了无尽的抗议和痛楚。","It was a cry that began, muffled, in the deeps of sleep, that swiftly rushed upward, like a wail, into passionate belligerence, and that died away and sank down into an inarticulate whine.It was a bestial cry, as of a soul in torment, filled with infinite protest and pain."
"但是，她并不理睬。她眼神凄凉、脸色憔悴。对这件事她已经全然习惯了，在她的生活中每天如此。她抓住他的被子想把它拉下来，但是男孩子停止挥动拳头，拼命地抓紧了被子。他蜷着身子，缩在床脚，仍然盖着被子。接着，她试着把被子拖到地上。男孩与她抗衡着。她早有防备。她在体重上占了优势，男孩和被子让步了。孩子本能地随着被子移动，以免被房间里刺骨的寒气给冻着。","But she did not mind.She was a sad-eyed, tired-faced woman, and she had grown used to this task, which she repeated every day of her life.She got a grip on the bed-clothes and tried to strip them down; but the boy, ceasing his punching, clung to them desperately.In a huddle, at the foot of the bed, he still remained covered.Then she tried dragging the bedding to the floor.The boy opposed her.She braced herself.Hers was the superior weight, and the boy and bedding gave, the former instinctively following the latter in order to shelter against the chill of the room that bit into his body."
"他被拖到床边的时候，好像就要头冲下栽到地上了。可是苏醒的意识搅扰着他。他坐正了身子，摇摇欲坠地晃了一会儿才保持住平衡。接着，他一下子站到了地上。他的母亲立刻抓住他的肩膀摇晃他。他又一次挥起了拳头，这次劲儿更大，打得也更准了。与此同时，他的眼睛睁开了。她放开了他。他醒了。","As he toppled on the edge of the bed it seemed that he must fall head-first to the floor.But consciousness fluttered up in him.He righted himself and for a moment perilously balanced.Then he struck the floor on his feet.On the instant his mother seized him by the shoulders and shook him.Again his fists struck out, this time with more force and directness.At the same time his eyes opened.She released him.He was awake."
"“好了。”他咕哝着说。","“All right,” he mumbled."
"她抓起油灯匆匆离开，把他丢在了黑暗里。","She caught up the lamp and hurried out, leaving him in darkness."
"“你会被扣钱的。”她扭过头警告他。","“You’ll be docked,” she warned back to him."
"他不在乎黑暗。他穿好衣服，走出房间，进了厨房。这样一个又瘦又轻的男孩，脚步却很沉重。他走路时双腿总是拖着步，似乎重得不合情理，因为这双腿是如此瘦骨嶙峋。他拉过一把坐垫破了的椅子，坐到桌子边。","He did not mind the darkness.When he had got into his clothes, he went out into the kitchen.His tread was very heavy for so thin and light a boy.His legs dragged with their own weight, which seemed unreasonable because they were such skinny legs.He drew a broken-bottomed chair to the table."
"“约翰尼！”他母亲猛地喊道。","“Johnny!” his mother called sharply."
"他猛地站起来，一声不响地走到水槽边。那是个油腻、肮脏的水槽。排水口冒着一股子臭味。他对此并不在意。对他来说，水槽有臭味是其自身特征的一部分，正如被洗盘子的水弄脏的肥皂很难产生泡沫一样。他也不会费力去使那种肥皂起泡沫。他让水龙头里的冷水哗啦啦地冲洗了几下就完事了。他没有刷牙。实际上，他从来都没有见过牙刷。他也不知道世界上存在着要遭罪刷牙的愚蠢之极的人。","He arose as sharply from the chair, and, without a word, went to the sink.It was a greasy, filthy sink.A smell came up from the outlet.He took no notice of it.That a sink should smell was to him part of the natural order, just as it was a part of the natural order that the soap should be grimy with dish-water and hard to lather.Nor did he try very hard to make it lather.Several splashes of the cold water from the running faucet completed the function.He did not wash his teeth.For that matter he had never seen a tooth-brush, nor did he know that there existed beings in the world who were guilty of so great a foolishness as tooth washing."
"“不用人告诉，你也该知道每天洗一次脸哪。”他母亲抱怨着。","“You might wash yourself wunst a day without bein’ told,” his mother complained."
"她摁住壶上的破盖子倒了两杯咖啡。他没有说话，因为他们经常为这事吵起来，而且他母亲在这事上如硬石一样顽固。每天洗“一次”脸，这是他必须做的。他用一条油腻腻的、又湿又脏的破毛巾擦了擦脸，结果弄得脸上沾满了毛巾的碎线头。","She was holding a broken lid on the pot as she poured two cups of coffee.He made no remark, for this was a standing quarrel between them, and the one thing upon which his mother was hard as adamant.“Wunst” a day it was compulsory that he should wash his face.He dried himself on a greasy towel, damp and dirty and ragged, that left his face covered with shreds of lint."
"“要是咱们住得没这么远该多好。”她说道，此时约翰尼坐了下来。“我尽我所能了。你知道的。可是省一块钱的房租也是个数目呢，而且这儿的房子也比较宽敞。你知道的。”","“I wish we didn’t live so far away,” she said, as he sat down.“I try to do the best I can.You know that.But a dollar on the rent is such a savin’, an’ we’ve more room here.You know that.”"
"他几乎没有听她说。以前他听她讲过很多次了。她的思想范围很有限，她总是老生常谈，说他们之所以受苦就是因为他们住得离工厂太远了。","He scarcely followed her.He had heard it all before, many times.The range of her thought was limited, and she was ever harking back to the hardship worked upon them by living so far from the mills."
"“省一块钱就多点儿吃的，”他言简意赅地说道，“我宁愿多走点儿路，好多弄点儿吃的。”","“A dollar means more grub,” he remarked sententiously.“I’d sooner do the walkin’ an’ git the grub.”"
"他急匆匆地吃着，只把面包嚼了几下就用咖啡把没嚼碎的面包块冲下去了。所谓的咖啡不过是一种热的、混浊的液体。约翰尼觉得这就是咖啡——而且是顶好的咖啡。那是他生活中残存的几个幻想之一。他这辈子就没有喝过真正的咖啡。","He ate hurriedly, half chewing the bread and washing the unmasticated chunks down with coffee.The hot and muddy liquid went by the name of coffee.Johnny thought it was coffee—and excellent coffee.That was one of the few of life’s illusions that remained to him.He had never drunk real coffee in his life."
"除了面包之外，还有一小块冷的猪肉。母亲又给他斟满了一杯咖啡。当他快要吃完面包的时候，就开始观察是不是还有吃的。他询问的目光被她打断了。","In addition to the bread, there was a small piece of cold pork.His mother refilled his cup with coffee.As he was finishing the bread, he began to watch if more was forthcoming.She intercepted his questioning glance."
"“好啦，约翰尼，别像猪一样贪吃，”她说道，“你已经吃完你的那份了。你弟弟妹妹的饭可都比你少。”","“Now, don’t be hoggish, Johnny,” was her comment.“You’ve had your share.Your brothers an’ sisters are smaller’n you.”"
"他没有回应母亲的指责。他不是个话多的人。而且，他已经不再如饥似渴地张望了。他从不埋怨，他的忍耐力跟教会他忍耐的那个学校一样可怕。喝完咖啡，他用手背抹了抹嘴，然后站了起来。","He did not answer the rebuke.He was not much of a talker.Also, he ceased his hungry glancing for more.He was uncomplaining, with a patience that was as terrible as the school in which it had been learned.He finished his coffee, wiped his mouth on the back of his hand, and started to rise."
"“等一下，”她匆匆地说，“我想这面包可以再给你切一片——一片薄的。”","“Wait a second,” she said hastily.“I guess the loaf kin stand you another slice—a thin un.”"
"她的动作跟变戏法一样。她好像从面包上切下了一片给他，但是接着她把面包和切下的那片放回了面包箱里，然后从她自己的两片面包里拿了一片给他。她以为骗过了他，其实他早看穿了她的花招。然而，他还是厚着脸皮拿过了那片面包。他有一套自己的见解，那就是不管他母亲的慢性病情况怎样，反正她是吃不多的。","There was legerdemain in her actions.With all the seeming of cutting a slice from the loaf for him, she put loaf and slice back in the bread box and conveyed to him one of her own two slices.She believed she had deceived him, but he had noted her sleight-of-hand.Nevertheless, he took the bread shamelessly.He had a philosophy that his mother, what of her chronic sickliness, was not much of an eater anyway."
"她看到他正干嚼面包，于是伸手把自己的那杯咖啡倒在了他的杯子里。","She saw that he was chewing the bread dry, and reached over and emptied her coffee cup into his."
"“今天早晨，我胃里好像不怎么舒服。”她解释道。","“Don’t set good somehow on my stomach this morning,” she explained."
"远处的汽笛拖长了调子尖叫着，这让他们都站起身来。她瞟了一眼架子上的铁皮闹钟。指针指向五点半。工厂区的其他人刚刚从睡眠中醒来。她拉过一条披肩披在肩上，头上戴了顶肮脏、走了形且很旧的帽子。","A distant whistle, prolonged and shrieking, brought both of them to their feet.She glanced at the tin alarm-clock on the shelf.The hands stood at half-past five.The rest of the factory world was just arousing from sleep.She drew a shawl about her shoulders, and on her head put a dingy hat, shapeless and ancient."
"“我们得跑着了。”她一面说一面捻了捻灯芯，吹灭了玻璃灯罩里的火苗。","“We’ve got to run,” she said, turning the wick of the lamp and blowing down the chimney."
"他们摸黑出了屋子，走下楼梯。天很晴，也很冷。约翰尼一到外面就冻得哆嗦了一下。天上的群星还没有开始泛白，城里一片漆黑。约翰尼和他母亲拖着步子走着。他们似乎都没有力气提起腿来走路。","They groped their way out and down the stairs.It was clear and cold, and Johnny shivered at the first contact with the outside air.The stars had not yet begun to pale in the sky, and the city lay in blackness.Both Johnny and his mother shuffled their feet as they walked.There was no ambition in the leg muscles to swing the feet clear of the ground."
"默默地走了十五分钟后，母亲拐弯向右走去。","After fifteen silent minutes, his mother turned off to the right."
"“别晚了。”她最后告诫了一句，便被吞没在了夜幕之中。","“Don’t be late,” was her final warning from out of the dark that was swallowing her up."
"他只顾着走自己的路，没有回应。在工厂区里，家家都在开门。不一会儿，他就随着一大群人匆匆地在黑暗中往前赶路。当他走进工厂大门的时候，汽笛声又响了。他朝东边瞟了一眼。房顶上参差不齐的天际边刚刚爬上了一抹淡淡的鱼肚白。每天他都看到这么一点点日光，然后便转身融入他的一帮工人中。","He made no response, steadily keeping on his way.In the factory quarter, doors were opening everywhere, and he was soon one of a multitude that pressed onward through the dark.As he entered the factory gate the whistle blew again.He glanced at the east.Across a ragged sky-line of housetops a pale light was beginning to creep.This much he saw of the day as he turned his back upon it and joined his work gang."
"他穿过长长的几排机器，走到了自己的位置上。他面前的箱子里装满了小线轴，箱子上是飞快旋转的大线轴。他的工作就是把小线轴上的纱缠到大线轴上去。这份工作很简单。只是要求速度要快。小线轴放线特别快，一会儿就放空了，而放空了线的大线轴又那么多，所以一点儿空闲的时间都没有。","He took his place in one of many long rows of machines.Before him, above a bin filled with small bobbins, were large bobbins revolving rapidly.Upon these he wound the jute-twine of the small bobbins.The work was simple.All that was required was celerity.The small bobbins were emptied so rapidly, and there were so many large bobbins that did the emptying, that there were no idle moments."
"他机械地工作着。每当小线轴的纱放光时，他就用左手当刹车，停住大线轴，同时用拇指和食指捏住飞出来的线头。与此同时，他用右手捏住小线轴上松了的线头。这一系列动作都是双手同时即刻完成的。接着，他手一闪，松开接好的线头，放开线轴。接纱头并不难。他曾经自夸说，自己睡着了也能接好纱头。而对于这个问题，有时候也的确如此。整个晚上，他都在睡梦里没完没了地接着纱头，仿佛辛苦了几百年。","He worked mechanically.When a small bobbin ran out, he used his left hand for a brake, stopping the large bobbin and at the same time, with thumb and forefinger, catching the flying end of twine.Also, at the same time, with his right hand, he caught up the loose twine-end of a small bobbin.These various acts with both hands were performed simultaneously and swiftly.Then there would come a flash of his hands as he looped the weaver’s knot and released the bobbin.There was nothing difficult about weaver’s knots.He once boasted he could tie them in his sleep.And for that matter, he sometimes did, toiling centuries long in a single night at tying an endless succession of weaver’s knots."
"有几个男孩子偷懒，小线轴放光了纱的时候也不换上新的，以此来消磨功夫、耗费机器。不过，有个监工会阻止这样的事情发生。他发现约翰尼旁边的那个孩子正在玩这种把戏，就马上给了他一记耳光。","Some of the boys shirked, wasting time and machinery by not replacing the small bobbins when they ran out.And there was an overseer to prevent this.He caught Johnny’s neighbor at the trick, and boxed his ears."
"“看看约翰尼——为什么你就不能像他一样呢？”监工怒气冲冲地责问着。","“Look at Johnny there—why ain’t you like him?” the overseer wrathfully demanded."
"约翰尼的线轴全速地旋转着，他并没有因为这一间接夸奖而感到兴奋。也曾经有过一段时间，他的确得意过——不过那是太久以前的事了。如今，当听到别人把自己当作光辉的榜样来说的时候，他冷冷的脸上也没有任何的表情。他是个完美的工人。这一点，他知道的。别人也常常跟他这样说。这不过是句再普通不过的话，而且对他来讲这话已经没有任何意义了。他已经从一个完美的工人进化成了一部完美的机器。如果他的活儿出了问题，那就跟机器犯毛病一样，是原料不好的原因。要是他出了什么差错，那就等于是一部完美的铸钉机器铸出了不合格的钉子一样。","Johnny’s bobbins were running full blast, but he did not thrill at the indirect praise.There had been a time...but that was long ago, very long ago.His apathetic face was expressionless as he listened to himself being held up as a shining example.He was the perfect worker.He knew that.He had been told so, often.It was a commonplace, and besides it didn’t seem to mean anything to him any more.From the perfect worker he had evolved into the perfect machine.When his work went wrong, it was with him as with the machine, due to faulty material.It would have been as possible for a perfect nail-die to cut imperfect nails as for him to make a mistake."
"这一点儿都不稀奇。一直以来，他都跟机器有着密切的关系。机械装置几乎是已经植入了他的体内。至少，他是在机器上长大的。十二年前，就在这个工厂的织布车间里，曾经出现过一个小小的紧张场面。约翰尼的母亲晕倒了。他们把她平放在地上，置于轰鸣的机器中间。人们从织布车间里喊来了两个年纪大些的女人。工头也来帮忙。几分钟后，在织布车间里，在那些走进门的人群里就又多了一个人。那个人就是约翰尼，一生下来就听着织布机的轰鸣，呼吸着又湿又热的空气，空气中满是飘扬的飞花。为了把肺里的飞花排出来，他从出生的第一天起就开始咳嗽。也是因为这个缘故，他自此之后就一直咳嗽了。","And small wonder.There had never been a time when he had not been in intimate relationship with machines.Machinery had almost been bred into him, and at any rate he had been brought up on it.Twelve years before, there had been a small flutter of excitement in the loom room of this very mill.Johnny’s mother had fainted.They stretched her out on the floor in the midst of the shrieking machines.A couple of elderly women were called from their looms.The foreman assisted.And in a few minutes there was one more soul in the loom room than had entered by the doors.It was Johnny, born with the pounding, crashing roar of the looms in his ears, drawing with his first breath the warm, moist air that was thick with flying lint.He had coughed that first day in order to rid his lungs of the lint; and for the same reason he had coughed ever since."
"现在，约翰尼旁边的小孩抽抽噎噎地哭着。这个男孩子的脸抽搐着，满是对监工的仇恨。监工也在用威胁的眼光远远地盯着他，但是每一个线轴都在全速旋转着。孩子对着他面前旋转地线轴恶狠狠地咒骂着；但是车间里的轰鸣声吞没了他的声音，连六英尺外都是传不到的，就像是被墙挡住了一样。","The boy alongside of Johnny whimpered and sniffed.The boy’s face was convulsed with hatred for the overseer who kept a threatening eye on him from a distance; but every bobbin was running full.The boy yelled terrible oaths into the whirling bobbins before him; but the sound did not carry half a dozen feet, the roaring of the room holding it in and containing it like a wall."
"约翰尼根本没有注意这些。他自有一套接纳事物的方法。而且，事情若一再重复就会变得单调乏味，单就这件事来说，他就不知见了多少次了。他觉得反对监工是毫无用处的，正如反抗机器一样徒劳。机器被制造出来按特定的方式运转，就是用来完成特定任务的。监工也是一样。","Of all this Johnny took no notice.He had a way of accepting things.Besides, things grow monotonous by repetition, and this particular happening he had witnessed many times.It seemed to him as useless to oppose the overseer as to defy the will of a machine.Machines were made to go in certain ways and to perform certain tasks.It was the same with the overseer."
"但是十一点钟的时候，车间里一下子紧张了起来。这种紧张情绪显然很神秘地立刻就传遍了每一个角落。在约翰尼另一边工作的一个一条腿的男孩赶忙一跛一跛地跳过去，来到一个装箱子的手推车前，车上是空的。他马上带着拐杖钻了进去，不见了。工厂的主管走了过来，身边还有一个年轻人。年轻人衣着讲究，穿着一件浆过的衬衫——以约翰尼对人的分类方法，他一定是位绅士，而且一定是那位“巡官”。","But at eleven o’clock there was excitement in the room.In an apparently occult way the excitement instantly permeated everywhere.The one-legged boy who worked on the other side of Johnny bobbed swiftly across the floor to a bin truck that stood empty.Into this he dived out of sight, crutch and all.The superintendent of the mill was coming along, accompanied by a young man.He was well dressed and wore a starched shirt—a gentleman, in Johnny’s classification of men, and also, “the Inspector.”"
"巡官边走边目光锐利地看着那些男孩子。有时候他会停下来问几句话。当他问话的时候，他不得不提高嗓门，拼命地喊，以便让别人听到他的话。这时，他的脸就会扭曲成一副很滑稽的样子。他眼光犀利，一下子就注意到约翰尼旁边那台空着的机器，可是他一句话也没有说。他也注意到了约翰尼，突然间他停了下来。他抓着约翰尼的胳膊把他从机器旁拖开了一步。然后，他十分诧异地叫了一声，又把约翰尼的胳膊松开了。","He looked sharply at the boys as he passed along.Sometimes he stopped and asked questions.When he did so, he was compelled to shout at the top of his lungs, at which moments his face was ludicrously contorted with the strain of making himself heard.His quick eye noted the empty machine alongside of Johnny’s, but he said nothing.Johnny also caught his eye, and he stopped abruptly.He caught Johnny by the arm to draw him back a step from the machine; but with an exclamation of surprise he released the arm."
"“太瘦了。”主管不安地笑着说。","“Pretty skinny,” the superintendent laughed anxiously."
"“跟烟管子似的。”巡官回答着，“看那两条腿。这孩子有佝偻病——初期的，不过他已经得了这个病。要是他将来不是死在癫痫病上，那肯定是肺结核先要了他的小命。”","“Pipe stems,” was the answer.“Look at those legs.The boy’s got the rickets—incipient, but he’s got them.If epilepsy doesn’t get him in the end, it will be because tuberculosis gets him first.”"
"约翰尼听着，但是他听不懂他们在说什么。再者，他对将来生什么样的病并不感兴趣。眼前就有一种更直接、更严重的病威胁着他：就是那位巡官。","Johnny listened, but did not understand.Furthermore he was not interested in future ills.There was an immediate and more serious ill that threatened him in the form of the inspector."
"“喂，小家伙，你老实告诉我，”为了让他听见，巡官弯下腰，贴近约翰尼的耳朵说道，或可以说是喊道，“你多大了？”","“Now, my boy, I want you to tell me the truth,” the inspector said, or shouted, bending close to the boy’s ear to make him hear.“How old are you?”"
"“十四。”约翰尼撒谎说，他用尽浑身力气喊出了这句谎话。喊得太用力了，他开始频频干咳，咳得他把整个上午吸到肺里的飞花都呛了出来。","“Fourteen,” Johnny lied, and he lied with the full force of his lungs.So loudly did he lie that it started him off in a dry, hacking cough that lifted the lint which had been settling in his lungs all morning."
"“看上去至少也有十六岁。”主管说。","“Looks sixteen at least,” said the superintendent."
"“或者六十。”巡官厉声说。","“Or sixty,” snapped the inspector."
"“他老是这个样子。”","“He’s always looked that way.”"
"“多久了？”巡官马上问道。","“How long?” asked the inspector, quickly."
"“有些年头了。简直一点儿也没有长大。”","“For years.Never gets a bit older.”"
"“我敢说，他倒是长小了。我看他这几年都在这儿干活了吧？”","“Or younger, I dare say.I suppose he’s worked here all those years?”"
"“有的时候在，有时不在——不过那是在新法律颁布以前的事了。”主管连忙补充道。“这部机器闲着吗？”巡官指着约翰尼旁边那台空机器问道，那上面没有装满的线轴正发疯似地旋转着。","“Off and on—but that was before the new law was passed,” the superintendent hastened to add.“Machine idle?” the inspector asked, pointing at the unoccupied machine beside Johnny’s, in which the part-filled bobbins were flying like mad."
"“好像是闲着的。”主管示意监工过来，然后指着机器，对着他的耳朵高声喊了几句。“这部机器是闲着的。”他向巡官报告说。","“Looks that way.”The superintendent motioned the overseer to him and shouted in his ear and pointed at the machine.“Machine’s idle,” he reported back to the inspector."
"他们走过去了，约翰尼回来继续干活。他松了一口气，总算是躲过了一劫。可是独腿的那个男孩却没有那么好的运气。目光敏锐的巡官把胳膊伸到那辆装箱子的手推车里，一把就把他拉了出来。他吓得嘴唇发抖，脸色大变，就像一个人遭遇了一场无可挽回的大祸一样。监工看起来大吃一惊，好像他第一次看到这个孩子似的。主管满脸的震惊和不快。","They passed on, and Johnny returned to his work, relieved in that the ill had been averted.But the one-legged boy was not so fortunate.The sharp-eyed inspector haled him out at arm’s length from the bin truck.His lips were quivering, and his face had all the expression of one upon whom was fallen profound and irremediable disaster.The overseer looked astounded, as though for the first time he had laid eyes on the boy, while the superintendent’s face expressed shock and displeasure."
"“我认识他，”巡官说道，“他十二岁。今年我已经从三家工厂里把他赶了出来。这是第四次了。”","“I know him,” the inspector said.“He’s twelve years old.I’ve had him discharged from three factories inside the year.This makes the fourth.”"
"他转向那个独腿的男孩。“你已经答应过我了，你发过誓要去上学的。”","He turned to the one-legged boy.“You promised me, word and honor, that you’d go to school.”"
"独腿的男孩突然放声哭了起来。“求求您了，巡官先生，我们家已经死了两个小孩了，我们家实在是太穷了。”","The one-legged boy burst into tears.“Please, Mr. Inspector, two babies died on us, and we’re awful poor.”"
"“你怎么咳嗽得这么厉害？”巡官询问着，好像在指责他犯了罪一样。","“What makes you cough that way?” the inspector demanded, as though charging him with crime."
"独腿的男孩像在否认自己的罪行似的回答道：“没有什么的。我只是上星期着凉了。巡官先生，没有什么。”","And as in denial of guilt, the one-legged boy replied: “It ain’t nothin’.I jes’ caught a cold last week, Mr. Inspector, that’s all.”"
"最后，独腿的男孩跟着巡官走了出去，焦虑的主管争辩着什么，也陪着走了。之后，车间里又恢复了单调的气氛。漫长的上午和更漫长的下午过去之后，下班的汽笛声响了起来。约翰尼走出工厂的大门时，夜幕已经降临了。在这一天里，太阳好像把天空当作了一架金梯，让世界都充满了它仁慈的暖意，然后在西边沉下去，消失在被屋顶划得参差不齐的天际线之后。","In the end the one-legged boy went out of the room with the inspector, the latter accompanied by the anxious and protesting superintendent.After that monotony settled down again.The long morning and the longer afternoon wore away and the whistle blew for quitting time.Darkness had already fallen when Johnny passed out through the factory gate.In the interval the sun had made a golden ladder of the sky, flooded the world with its gracious warmth, and dropped down and disappeared in the west behind a ragged sky-line of housetops."
"晚饭是一天中全家在一起吃的一顿饭——约翰尼在这时能遇到自己的弟弟和妹妹。对他来说，这种见面有点儿遭遇战的性质。因为他太老了，而他们却幼稚得令人苦恼。他受不了他们那种过分的、让人吃惊的幼稚。他不理解这个。他自己的童年已经距他太远了。他像一个易怒的老人，被他们幼稚的胡闹弄得心烦气躁，因为在他看来，这真是愚蠢至极。他怒目而视，静静地吃饭。后来想到他们不久也要去上班了，他才找到一些心理平衡。工作会抹掉他们的棱角，而且会使他们变得稳重、威严——正如他一样。约翰尼就是这样，照着一般人的方式，以自身为准绳，去衡量整个世界。","Supper was the family meal of the day—the one meal at which Johnny encountered his younger brothers and sisters.It partook of the nature of an encounter, to him, for he was very old, while they were distressingly young.He had no patience with their excessive and amazing juvenility.He did not understand it.His own childhood was too far behind him.He was like an old and irritable man, annoyed by the turbulence of their young spirits that was to him arrant silliness.He glowered silently over his food, finding compensation in the thought that they would soon have to go to work.That would take the edge off of them and make them sedate and dignified—like him.Thus it was, after the fashion of the human, that Johnny made of himself a yardstick with which to measure the universe."
"吃饭的时候，母亲用尽种种方法不厌其烦地重复解释说，她正在尽力使日子变得更好一些。约翰尼一直听到这顿寒酸的晚饭结束，他把椅子往后一推站了起来，觉得松了一口气。他在床和大门的选择中踌躇了片刻，最后还是走出了大门。他并没有走远。他坐在台阶上，蜷起双膝，瘦瘦的双肩向前垂着，胳膊肘撑在膝盖上，手掌托着下巴。坐在那里，他什么也没有想。他只是休息。就他的脑子而言，却睡着了。随后，他的弟弟妹妹们出来了，跟其他的孩子们一起在他周围吵闹着玩耍。角落里一盏电灯照着这些孩子们嬉戏。孩子们都知道他暴躁易怒，但这些爱冒险的孩子们依旧忍不住去招惹他。孩子们在他面前手拉手，合着拍子摇动着身体，朝着他反复地唱着古怪、刺耳的打油诗。起先，他还咆哮着咒骂他们——用他从形形色色的工头们那儿学来的咒骂的话。后来他发现骂是不管用的，他又想起了自己的尊严，于是他又固执地恢复了沉默。","During the meal, his mother explained in various ways and with infinite repetition that she was trying to do the best she could; so that it was with relief, the scant meal ended, that Johnny shoved back his chair and arose.He debated for a moment between bed and the front door, and finally went out the latter.He did not go far.He sat down on the stoop, his knees drawn up and his narrow shoulders drooping forward, his elbows on his knees and the palms of his hands supporting his chin.As he sat there, he did no thinking.He was just resting.So far as his mind was concerned, it was asleep.His brothers and sisters came out, and with other children played noisily about him.An electric globe on the corner lighted their frolics.He was peevish and irritable, that they knew; but the spirit of adventure lured them into teasing him.They joined hands before him, and, keeping time with their bodies, chanted in his face weird and uncomplimentary doggerel.At first he snarled curses at them—curses he had learned from the lips of various foremen.Finding this futile, and remembering his dignity, he relapsed into dogged silence."
"他的大弟弟威尔，年龄与他最相近，刚刚过了十岁生日，就是这些孩子们的头儿。尤其是对威尔，约翰尼没有一点儿好感。他的生活早就由于不断地为威尔牺牲和妥协让步而变得痛苦不堪了。他明确地感觉到威尔受了他的大恩惠，却是个忘恩负义的家伙。回首过去，在他记不太清的日子里，他的玩耍时间大部分都因为必须照顾威尔而被牺牲掉了。那时威尔还是个小婴儿，他们的母亲就像现在一样整天在工厂里做工。因此，担任小父亲和小母亲的角色就都落到了约翰尼的肩上。","His brother Will, next to him in age, having just passed his tenth birthday, was the ring-leader.Johnny did not possess particularly kindly feelings toward him.His life had early been embittered by continual giving over and giving way to Will.He had a definite feeling that Will was greatly in his debt and was ungrateful about it.In his own playtime, far back in the dim past, he had been robbed of a large part of that playtime by being compelled to take care of Will.Will was a baby then, and then, as now, their mother had spent her days in the mills.To Johnny had fallen the part of little father and little mother as well."
"他的牺牲和让步，威尔看起来是颇为受益的。他发育得很好，相当健壮，个头跟他哥哥一样高，甚至比他哥哥还要沉些。似乎他哥哥的血液流到了弟弟的血管里似的。精神上也是如此。约翰尼总是疲倦不堪、筋疲力尽、没有活力，而威尔则看起来生气勃勃，精力充沛。","Will seemed to show the benefit of the giving over and the giving way.He was well-built, fairly rugged, as tall as his elder brother and even heavier.It was as though the life-blood of the one had been diverted into the other’s veins.And in spirits it was the same.Johnny was jaded, worn out, without resilience, while his younger brother seemed bursting and spilling over with exuberance."
"这时候，嘲笑的歌声越来大了。威尔一面跳舞，一面凑了过来，还冲他吐舌头。约翰尼突然伸出左臂一把搂住威尔的脖子。同时，他用皮包骨的拳头打威尔的鼻子。这个拳头瘦得可怜，但是足够厉害了，从他弟弟疼得尖叫的声音里就可以得到证明。其他的孩子们全吓得喊叫起来，约翰尼的妹妹珍妮赶紧冲回屋里去了。","The mocking chant rose louder and louder.Will leaned closer as he danced, thrusting out his tongue.Johnny’s left arm shot out and caught the other around the neck.At the same time he rapped his bony fist to the other’s nose.It was a pathetically bony fist, but that it was sharp to hurt was evidenced by the squeal of pain it produced.The other children were uttering frightened cries, while Johnny’s sister, Jennie, had dashed into the house."
"他推开威尔，恶狠狠地踢他的小腿，然后抓着他，把他的脸猛地朝下往泥里摔。他把威尔的脸往泥里摔了好几次才罢手放开了他。接着，他母亲像一阵无力的旋风一样赶到了，带着满腔的担忧和母性的愤怒。","He thrust Will from him, kicked him savagely on the shins, then reached for him and slammed him face downward in the dirt.Nor did he release him till the face had been rubbed into the dirt several times.Then the mother arrived, an anaemic whirlwind of solicitude and maternal wrath."
"“为什么他非要惹我呢？”约翰尼挨了母亲的责骂后回答道，“难道他看不出来我很累吗？”","“Why can’t he leave me alone?” was Johnny’s reply to her upbraiding.“Can’t he see I’m tired?”"
"“我和你一样高，”威尔在母亲的怀里气得要命。他的脸被眼泪、鲜血和脏土弄得一塌糊涂。“我现在就和你长得一样大，以后我会超过你。到时候我会揍你——你等着瞧。”","“I’m as big as you,” Will raged in her arms, his face a mess of tears, dirt, and blood.“I’m as big as you now, an’ I’m goin’ to git bigger.Then I’ll lick you—see if I don’t.”"
"“既然你知道自己长得多大，你就该去做工。”约翰尼咆哮道，“你的问题就在这儿。你应该去工作。你的妈妈该让你去工作。”","“You ought to be to work, seein’ how big you are,” Johnny snarled.“That’s what’s the matter with you.You ought to be to work.An’ it’s up to your ma to put you to work.”"
"“但是他太小了，”母亲争辩道，“他还只是个小孩子。”","“But he’s too young,” she protested.“He’s only a little boy.”"
"“我开始做工的时候比他还小呢。”","“I was younger’n him when I started to work.”"
"约翰尼张着嘴，想继续发泄他心中的不平，可是他还是突然止住了。他沮丧地站起来，大步走到屋里睡觉去了。他的房门开着，好让厨房的暖气进来。他在半明半暗的光线里脱衣服的时候，听见了母亲跟来串门的邻家女人说话。母亲在哭泣，话语间还不时地夹杂着无力的抽噎声。","Johnny’s mouth was open, further to express the sense of unfairness that he felt, but the mouth closed with a snap.He turned gloomily on his heel and stalked into the house and to bed.The door of his room was open to let in warmth from the kitchen.As he undressed in the semi-darkness he could hear his mother talking with a neighbor woman who had dropped in.His mother was crying, and her speech was punctuated with spiritless sniffles."
"“我不知道约翰尼怎么回事，”他听到母亲说着，“他从来不这样。以前，他可是个耐心的小天使。","“I can’t make out what’s gittin’ into Johnny,” he could hear her say.“He didn’t used to be this way.He was a patient little angel."
"现在也是个好孩子，”她连忙又为他辩护道，“他干活踏实，而且他确实工作得太早了。但这不是我的错。我确信，我已经尽力了。”","“An’ he is a good boy,” she hastened to defend.“He’s worked faithful, an’ he did go to work too young.But it wasn’t my fault.I do the best I can, I’m sure.”"
"厨房里传来了长长的啜泣声，约翰尼一面合上眼皮，一面喃喃自语：“我本来就是在踏踏实实地干活。”","Prolonged sniffling from the kitchen, and Johnny murmured to himself as his eyelids closed down, “You betcher life I’ve worked faithful.”"
"第二天早晨，约翰尼又被母亲从沉沉的睡梦中硬拖起来。吃过寒酸的早饭，他摸黑赶路，房顶上曙光暗淡，他转身走进工厂的大门。又是一天，一年到头这样的日子，天天如此。","The next morning he was torn bodily by his mother from the grip of sleep.Then came the meagre breakfast, the tramp through the dark, and the pale glimpse of day across the housetops as he turned his back on it and went in through the factory gate.It was another day, of all the days, and all the days were alike."
"然而，有时候是有变化的——有时候他会换工作，有时候他会生病。六岁的时候，他就是威尔和其他更小的弟弟妹妹们的小父亲、小母亲。七岁的时候他去工厂里——在那儿绕线轴。八岁的时候，他去了另一家工厂工作。他的新差事容易极了。他只要坐着，手拿一根小棍子，引导经过他面前川流不息地流过去的布匹就可以了。这些川流不息的布像从机器的胃里出来一样，然后经过一个热滚筒，就流到别处了。可是，他始终坐在一个位置上，日光照不到他，只有一盏煤气灯挂在他头顶上方闪闪发光；他自己也成了机器的一部分。","And yet there had been variety in his life—at the times he changed from one job to another, or was taken sick.When he was six, he was little mother and father to Will and the other children still younger.At seven he went into the mills—winding bobbins.When he was eight, he got work in another mill.His new job was marvellously easy.All he had to do was to sit down with a little stick in his hand and guide a stream of cloth that flowed past him.This stream of cloth came out of the maw of a machine, passed over a hot roller, and went on its way elsewhere.But he sat always in the one place, beyond the reach of daylight, a gas-jet flaring over him, himself part of the mechanism."
"尽管那里又湿又热，他还是很喜欢这个差事，毕竟他还小，充满了梦想和幻想。他一边看着川流不息的布无穷尽地流过去，一边做着自己的美梦。不过这个差事不需要活动，不用动脑子。他的梦想越来越少了，脑子也越来越迟钝，昏昏欲睡的。然而，他每周能挣两块钱。这两块钱意味着急性饥饿和慢性吃不饱之间的区别。","He was very happy at that job, in spite of the moist heat, for he was still young and in possession of dreams and illusions.And wonderful dreams he dreamed as he watched the streaming cloth streaming endlessly by.But there was no exercise about the work, no call upon his mind, and he dreamed less and less, while his mind grew torpid and drowsy.Nevertheless, he earned two dollars a week, and two dollars represented the difference between acute starvation and chronic underfeeding."
"但是，他九岁的时候失业了。因为他得了麻疹。病愈以后，他在一家玻璃厂找了份工作。工资高了些，可是这活儿需要技巧。这是份计件付酬的活计，技术越高，赚钱越多。刺激就在于此。于是在这种刺激下，他渐渐变成了一个出色的工人。","But when he was nine, he lost his job.Measles was the cause of it.After he recovered, he got work in a glass factory.The pay was better, and the work demanded skill.It was piece-work, and the more skilful he was, the bigger wages he earned.Here was incentive.And under this incentive he developed into a remarkable worker."
"这个工作是很简单的，就是给塞在小瓶子里的玻璃塞系绳子。他的腰间带着一捆麻线。他把瓶子夹在双膝当中，这样就可以腾出双手来干活了。就这样，他总是坐着，身子向前倾着。他窄窄的肩膀变驼了，而他的胸部要每天被挤压十个钟头。这对他的肺不好，但是他一天能扎三百打的瓶子。","It was simple work, the tying of glass stoppers into small bottles.At his waist he carried a bundle of twine.He held the bottles between his knees so that he might work with both hands.Thus, in a sitting position and bending over his own knees, his narrow shoulders grew humped and his chest was contracted for ten hours each day.This was not good for the lungs, but he tied three hundred dozen bottles a day."
"主管为有他这样的童工而非常得意，并且总带着一些人来参观。十个小时内，三百打的瓶子就经他的手扎好了。这就意味着，他已经熟练地跟机器一样完美了。没有任何多余的动作。他的瘦胳膊的每一个动作，细手指上肌肉的每一次活动都是迅速而准确的。他工作得非常紧张，结果是他本人都变得神经质了。夜里，睡觉时他的肌肉抽搐着；白天，他更不能放松下来歇着。他一直地紧张着，他的肌肉持续地抽搐着。而且，他的脸色越来越差，飞花导致的咳嗽也越来越严重。后来，被挤压的胸腔里的虚弱的肺患上了肺炎，于是他丢掉了玻璃厂的工作。现在，他又回到了那家麻纺厂，他最初就是从这里开始绕线轴的。但是他提升在望。他是个优秀的工人。接下来，他就要到上浆车间去了，以后还会上到织布车间。至此就算升到顶了，只是他还可以提高工作效率。","The superintendent was very proud of him, and brought visitors to look at him.In ten hours three hundred dozen bottles passed through his hands.This meant that he had attained machine-like perfection.All waste movements were eliminated.Every motion of his thin arms, every movement of a muscle in the thin fingers, was swift and accurate.He worked at high tension, and the result was that he grew nervous.At night his muscles twitched in his sleep, and in the daytime he could not relax and rest.He remained keyed up and his muscles continued to twitch.Also he grew sallow and his lint-cough grew worse.Then pneumonia laid hold of the feeble lungs within the contracted chest, and he lost his job in the glass-works.Now he had returned to the jute mills where he had first begun with winding bobbins.But promotion was waiting for him.He was a good worker.He would next go on the starcher, and later he would go into the loom room.There was nothing after that except increased efficiency."
"机器比他刚上班的时候转得快多了，而他的脑子却转得慢了。他根本不再做梦了，尽管早些年他充满着梦想。曾经他还一度恋爱过。那是他刚开始引布过热滚筒的时候，她是主管的女儿。她比他大得多，一个年轻的女人，他只是远远地看到她五六次。但那没有什么关系。在面前流过的布面上，他勾画出了他灿烂的前程。他艰苦的劳动创造出了奇迹，他发明出神奇的机器，他赢得了厂子的领导权，最后他拥抱着她，庄严地吻着她的前额。","The machinery ran faster than when he had first gone to work, and his mind ran slower.He no longer dreamed at all, though his earlier years had been full of dreaming.Once he had been in love.It was when he first began guiding the cloth over the hot roller, and it was with the daughter of the superintendent.She was much older than he, a young woman, and he had seen her at a distance only a paltry half-dozen times.But that made no difference.On the surface of the cloth stream that poured past him, he pictured radiant futures wherein he performed prodigies of toil, invented miraculous machines, won to the mastership of the mills, and in the end took her in his arms and kissed her soberly on the brow."
"但是那已经是很久以前的事情了。现在他变得太老了，已经疲于恋爱了。况且，她已经嫁人去了别的地方，他也就不再费那份心思了。然而，那毕竟是一段美妙的经历，他常常回想起来，就像其他男女会回想起他们曾经相信童话的年纪一样。他从来都不信童话故事，也不信圣诞老人，但是他曾经暗中坚信过自己在热气腾腾的布流上织出的自己美好的未来。","But that was all in the long ago, before he had grown too old and tired to love.Also, she had married and gone away, and his mind had gone to sleep.Yet it had been a wonderful experience, and he used often to look back upon it as other men and women look back upon the time they believed in fairies.He had never believed in fairies nor Santa Claus; but he had believed implicitly in the smiling future his imagination had wrought into the steaming cloth stream."
"他很早就成熟了。自从七岁那年，当他第一次领到自己的工资，他的青春期就开始了。他萌生了某种自食其力的感觉，接着他和母亲的关系开始发生了变化。不知怎的，作为一个挣钱养家的人，他在世界上有了自己的工作，他跟母亲的地位就平等了。大人，一个十足的大人了，就是在他十一岁那年。那一年，他上了半年的夜班。没有哪个孩子上了夜班后还像个小孩子的。","He had become a man very early in life.At seven, when he drew his first wages, began his adolescence.A certain feeling of independence crept up in him, and the relationship between him and his mother changed.Somehow, as an earner and breadwinner, doing his own work in the world, he was more like an equal with her.Manhood, full-blown manhood, had come when he was eleven, at which time he had gone to work on the night shift for six months.No child works on the night shift and remains a child."
"他的生命中经历过几件大事。一件是他母亲买了一些加利福尼亚的梅干。另外两件是母亲烘了两次蛋奶糕。这些都是大事情。他很亲切地记得。当时，母亲还跟他说过，她还会给他做一种幸运的好吃的——“浮岛”，她说“比蛋奶糕要好吃”。好多年他都盼望着能坐在桌旁，面前摆着浮岛。直到最后，他发现这个想法就是一个地狱边境，里面充满着众多不能实现的理想。","There had been several great events in his life.One of these had been when his mother bought some California prunes.Two others had been the two times when she cooked custard.Those had been events.He remembered them kindly.And at that time his mother had told him of a blissful dish she would sometime make—“floating island,” she had called it, “better than custard.”For years he had looked forward to the day when he would sit down to the table with floating island before him, until at last he had relegated the idea of it to the limbo of unattainable ideals."
"有一次，他发现人行道上有枚二十五美分的银币。这也算他生平中的一件大事，然而也是一个悲剧。当时，银币的亮光一闪到他眼里，他还没来得及捡就知道自己的责任了。家里人一向都是吃不饱的，他应该像每个周六晚上把工资带回家里一样把银币带回去。他很清楚这种情况下自己该怎么做，但是他从来没花过自己的钱，他忍受着想吃糖果的煎熬。他馋疯了，这一辈子就过年过节的时候才尝到过那样的糖果。","Once he found a silver quarter lying on the sidewalk.That, also, was a great event in his life, withal a tragic one.He knew his duty on the instant the silver flashed on his eyes, before even he had picked it up.At home, as usual, there was not enough to eat, and home he should have taken it as he did his wages every Saturday night.Right conduct in this case was obvious; but he never had any spending of his money, and he was suffering from candy hunger.He was ravenous for the sweets that only on red-letter days he had ever tasted in his life."
"他没想自欺欺人。他知道这是罪过，可是他明知故犯了。他用十五美分买了些糖果，放纵了一回。省下的十美分，他本预备将来再大吃一次。但是他从来没有带钱的习惯，于是把钱弄丢了。这事发生时正当他良心上受尽种种折磨，这是上帝给他的报应。他胆战心惊地觉得一位可怕的、怒气冲冲的上帝就在他身旁。上帝看见了，上帝也迅速地惩罚了，使他不能完全享用罪恶的果实。","He did not attempt to deceive himself.He knew it was sin, and deliberately he sinned when he went on a fifteen-cent candy debauch.Ten cents he saved for a future orgy; but not being accustomed to the carrying of money, he lost the ten cents.This occurred at the time when he was suffering all the torments of conscience, and it was to him an act of divine retribution.He had a frightened sense of the closeness of an awful and wrathful God.God had seen, and God had been swift to punish, denying him even the full wages of sin."
"一回想起这件事，他总觉得这是他生平犯下的一大罪过；一回想起这件事，他就总是觉得良心不安，饱受又一次折磨。这就是他不可告人的丑事。而且，由于他的性格和环境，他回想起来会感到非常懊悔。他不满自己当初那样处理了那枚银币。本来他可以用更好的方法花掉它的，而且，由于他后来知道上帝下手很快，他本来应该一下子把钱用光，给上帝个措手不及。回想的时候，他重新把那枚银币花上了成百上千次，一次比一次划算。","In memory he always looked back upon that event as the one great criminal deed of his life, and at the recollection his conscience always awoke and gave him another twinge.It was the one skeleton in his closet.Also, being so made and circumstanced, he looked back upon the deed with regret.He was dissatisfied with the manner in which he had spent the quarter.He could have invested it better, and, out of his later knowledge of the quickness of God, he would have beaten God out by spending the whole quarter at one fell swoop.In retrospect he spent the quarter a thousand times, and each time to better advantage."
"关于过去的记忆里还有一件事，虽然有些模糊不清了，但他父亲那双野蛮的脚还是永远铭刻在了他的灵魂深处。与其说是具体一件事的印象，还不如说更像是一场噩梦——更像对原始人的记忆，使他梦见过去住在树上的祖先。","There was one other memory of the past, dim and faded, but stamped into his soul everlasting by the savage feet of his father.It was more like a nightmare than a remembered vision of a concrete thing—more like the race-memory of man that makes him fall in his sleep and that goes back to his arboreal ancestry."
"这件事在约翰尼白天清醒的时候是从来没想到过的。都是在夜里，当他躺在床上，神智逐渐模糊，最后睡着的时候才会想起来。这事总是把他从睡梦中吓醒。在他刚刚被惊醒的、不舒服的那一刻，他似乎是横着睡在床脚。而床上是父亲和母亲模糊的形象。他从来没有见过父亲长什么样子。他对父亲只有一个印象，那就是他那双野蛮、无情的脚。","This particular memory never came to Johnny in broad daylight when he was wide awake.It came at night, in bed, at the moment that his consciousness was sinking down and losing itself in sleep.It always aroused him to frightened wakefulness, and for the moment, in the first sickening start, it seemed to him that he lay crosswise on the foot of the bed.In the bed were the vague forms of his father and mother.He never saw what his father looked like.He had but one impression of his father, and that was that he had savage and pitiless feet."
"那些过去的记忆常常萦绕在他的脑海里，可是近来的事他却记不得了。每天都是一样的。昨天或者去年都是一样的，仿佛已隔千年——或者只过了一分钟。什么也不曾发生。没有任何标志时间行进的事件发生。时间没有行进。它总是静止地站着。只有那些旋转不停地机器在动，但也到不了哪里去——尽管它们转得更快了。","His earlier memories lingered with him, but he had no late memories.All days were alike.Yesterday or last year were the same as a thousand years—or a minute.Nothing ever happened.There were no events to mark the march of time.Time did not march.It stood always still.It was only the whirling machines that moved, and they moved nowhere—in spite of the fact that they moved faster."
"十四岁的时候，他去上浆机上去干活了。这是一件非常大的事。除了一夜的睡眠或每周的发薪日，到底是有了一件值得记忆的事情了。它标志着一个新纪元的到来。这是一次机器奥林匹克，是新纪元的开端。约翰尼不离嘴的口头禅有：“我到上浆机上干活的时候”，或者“在我到上浆机上工作之后”，或者“之前”。","When he was fourteen, he went to work on the starcher.It was a colossal event.Something had at last happened that could be remembered beyond a night’s sleep or a week’s pay-day.It marked an era.It was a machine Olympiad, a thing to date from.“When I went to work on the starcher,” or, “after,” or “before I went to work on the starcher,” were sentences often on his lips."
"他十六岁的生日是以他进织布车间，管理织布机来庆祝的。这又是个刺激的活儿，因为是个计件的工作。因为他早已被工厂铸造成了一部完美的机器，他驾轻就熟。三个月后，他监管两台织布机，后来是三台、四台。","He celebrated his sixteenth birthday by going into the loom room and taking a loom.Here was an incentive again, for it was piece-work.And he excelled, because the clay of him had been moulded by the mills into the perfect machine.At the end of three months he was running two looms, and, later, three and four."
"进织布间的第二年年底，他生产的布匹码数已经比其他任何织工都多了；比起那些不熟练的工人，他的生产量是他们的两倍。随着他赚钱的本事接近最高水平，他的家境也开始好转了。不过，这并不是说他增长的工资已经超过了需求的程度。孩子们都在长大。他们吃得更多了。他们都上学了，书本也要花钱。不知为何，他工作得越快，物价也涨得越快。甚至连房租也涨了，而房子的状况却因为失修变得每况愈下。","At the end of his second year at the looms he was turning out more yards than any other weaver, and more than twice as much as some of the less skilful ones.And at home things began to prosper as he approached the full stature of his earning power.Not, however, that his increased earnings were in excess of need.The children were growing up.They ate more.And they were going to school, and school-books cost money.And somehow, the faster he worked, the faster climbed the prices of things.Even the rent went up, though the house had fallen from bad to worse disrepair."
"他已经长高了，不过随着个头长高了，人却显得比先前更瘦了。而且，他的神经更紧张了。越是神经紧张，他的脾气就变得越乖戾和易怒。孩子们从多次痛苦的教训中学会了躲开他。他的母亲因为他的赚钱能力而尊重他，但不知怎的，这种尊重中却略带几分畏惧。","He had grown taller; but with his increased height he seemed leaner than ever.Also, he was more nervous.With the nervousness increased his peevishness and irritability.The children had learned by many bitter lessons to fight shy of him.His mother respected him for his earning power, but somehow her respect was tinctured with fear."
"他生活中没有任何的乐趣。他从来没有看到过白昼是怎么过去的。而夜晚，他都是在无意识中抽搐着睡去的。其他的时间他都在干活，他的意识里就只有机器。除此之外，他头脑里一片空白。他没有理想，但有一个幻想：那就是，他喝着最好的咖啡。他不过是一个干活的牲畜。他没有任何的精神生活，然而在他的内心深处，他不知道自己在权衡和细究自己每一个小时的劳碌，手的每一个动作，肌肉的每一次伸缩，并为将来的行动做准备，这行动将使他和他自己的小天地大吃一惊。","There was no joyousness in life for him.The procession of the days he never saw.The nights he slept away in twitching unconsciousness.The rest of the time he worked, and his consciousness was machine consciousness.Outside this his mind was a blank.He had no ideals, and but one illusion; namely, that he drank excellent coffee.He was a work-beast.He had no mental life whatever; yet deep down in the crypts of his mind, unknown to him, were being weighed and sifted every hour of his toil, every movement of his hands, every twitch of his muscles, and preparations were making for a future course of action that would amaze him and all his little world."
"暮春时节，有一天晚上他下班回来，他感觉到一种异乎寻常的疲惫。他坐下来吃饭的时候，大家好像都在热切地期待着什么，可是他并没有注意。他机械地吃着面前的东西，整顿饭都闷闷不乐、一声不响。孩子们在嘴里吧唧吧唧地吃得很响。可是他却充耳不闻。","It was in the late spring that he came home from work one night aware of unusual tiredness.There was a keen expectancy in the air as he sat down to the table, but he did not notice.He went through the meal in moody silence, mechanically eating what was before him.The children um’d and ah’d and made smacking noises with their mouths.But he was deaf to them."
"“你知道你吃的是什么吗？”母亲最后急切地问他。","“D’ye know what you’re eatin’?” his mother demanded at last, desperately."
"他茫然地看看面前的盘子，又茫然地看看她。","He looked vacantly at the dish before him, and vacantly at her."
"“是浮岛。”她得意地宣布。","“Floatin’ island,” she announced triumphantly."
"“哦。”他说道。","“Oh,” he said."
"“浮岛！”孩子们异口同声地大声喊道。","“Floating island!” the children chorussed loudly."
"“哦。”他说。接着他又吃了两三口，补充道：“我想是我今晚不怎么饿。”","“Oh,” he said.And after two or three mouthfuls, he added, “guess I ain’t hungry to-night.”"
"他放下汤匙，往后推了一下椅子，然后有气无力地从桌子边站了起来。","He dropped the spoon, shoved back his chair, and arose wearily from the table."
"“我想去睡觉了。”","“An’ I guess I’ll go to bed.”"
"他拖着双脚穿过厨房，脚步比平时更为沉重。脱衣服费了他九牛二虎之力，他一点儿都使不上劲。他终于爬到床上，无力地哭了起来，脚上还有一只鞋。他觉得脑袋里有什么东西向上涌，往外涨，弄得他脑子重重的，混乱如麻。他觉得自己的细手指粗得跟手腕一样，指尖也有一种细微的感觉，如同他的大脑一般茫然、模糊不清。他的腰部疼得让他受不了了。所有的骨头都在疼。他浑身都疼。他的脑袋里出现了上百万台的织布机，尖叫着、撞击着、压榨着、咆哮着。所有的空间里都充满着飞梭。它们在星空里飞快地穿梭，错综复杂。他自己掌控着一千台织布机，它们不断地加速，越来越快，他的大脑也松了弦，越转越快，变成了供给那一千支飞梭的纱线。","His feet dragged more heavily than usual as he crossed the kitchen floor.Undressing was a Titan’s task, a monstrous futility, and he wept weakly as he crawled into bed, one shoe still on.He was aware of a rising, swelling something inside his head that made his brain thick and fuzzy.His lean fingers felt as big as his wrist, while in the ends of them was a remoteness of sensation vague and fuzzy like his brain.The small of his back ached intolerably.All his bones ached.He ached everywhere.And in his head began the shrieking, pounding, crashing, roaring of a million looms.All space was filled with flying shuttles.They darted in and out, intricately, amongst the stars.He worked a thousand looms himself, and ever they speeded up, faster and faster, and his brain unwound, faster and faster, and became the thread that fed the thousand flying shuttles."
"第二天早晨，他没有去上工。他正在大脑里转动的千台织布机前，拼了命地忙着织布。他的母亲去上工了，不过走之前她先请来了一位医生。医生说，这是一种严重的流行性感冒。珍妮遵照医嘱，看护着约翰尼。","He did not go to work next morning.He was too busy weaving colossally on the thousand looms that ran inside his head.His mother went to work, but first she sent for the doctor.It was a severe attack of la grippe, he said.Jennie served as nurse and carried out his instructions."
"他病得很厉害，一周以后，约翰尼才能穿上衣服，在房间里无力地蹒跚。医生说，还得一周约翰尼才能回去工作。星期天的下午，也就是约翰尼复原的头一天，织布车间的工头来看他。工头对约翰尼的母亲说，这是他们织布车间里最好的织布工人。他们会给他保留他的工作的。他可以从周一起再休息一周，然后来上工。","It was a very severe attack, and it was a week before Johnny dressed and tottered feebly across the floor.Another week, the doctor said, and he would be fit to return to work.The foreman of the loom room visited him on Sunday afternoon, the first day of his convalescence.The best weaver in the room, the foreman told his mother.His job would be held for him.He could come back to work a week from Monday."
"“约翰尼，你为什么不谢谢他呢？”母亲焦急地问道。","“Why don’t you thank ’im, Johnny?” his mother asked anxiously."
"于是她歉意地跟客人解释说：“他病得太厉害了，到现在还没有清醒过来。”","“He’s ben that sick he ain’t himself yet,” she explained apologetically to the visitor."
"约翰尼弯着腰坐起来，死死地盯着地面。工头走后，他就那样坐了很久。外面很暖和，下午的时候他到门口的台阶上坐下了。有时候，他的嘴唇会动一下。他似乎陷入无尽的计算之中。","Johnny sat hunched up and gazing steadfastly at the floor.He sat in the same position long after the foreman had gone.It was warm outdoors, and he sat on the stoop in the afternoon.Sometimes his lips moved.He seemed lost in endless calculations."
"第二天早晨，天暖和起来以后，他又坐到门口的台阶上。他带着铅笔和纸继续他的计算，这是一种痛苦的、惊人的计算。","Next morning, after the day grew warm, he took his seat on the stoop.He had pencil and paper this time with which to continue his calculations, and he calculated painfully and amazingly."
"“百万之后是什么来着？”中午，威尔从学校回来，约翰尼问道，“你是怎么算的？”","“What comes after millions?” he asked at noon, when Will came home from school.“An’ how d’ye work ’em?”"
"那天下午他完成了他的任务。每一天，他都坐回到那个台阶上，不过他不带纸和铅笔了。他全神贯注于街对面的那棵树。几个小时里，他不断地研究着它，每当风吹得树枝摇摇摆摆、树叶摇摇曳曳时，他就会觉得很有意思。整整一周，他似乎都沉浸在与自己的深度交流之中。星期日，他坐在台阶上，放声大笑了几次，笑得他母亲心里很乱。她已经好多年没有听到过他笑了。","That afternoon finished his task.Each day, but without paper and pencil, he returned to the stoop.He was greatly absorbed in the one tree that grew across the street.He studied it for hours at a time, and was unusually interested when the wind swayed its branches and fluttered its leaves.Throughout the week he seemed lost in a great communion with himself.On Sunday, sitting on the stoop, he laughed aloud, several times, to the perturbation of his mother, who had not heard him laugh in years."
"第二天早晨，天没亮的时候，母亲走到约翰尼的床边去叫醒他。他这一周已经睡足了，很容易就醒了。母亲来扯他的被子的时候，他没有挣扎，也没有想把被子抓住。他静静地躺着，静静地说着什么。","Next morning, in the early darkness, she came to his bed to rouse him.He had had his fill of sleep all week, and awoke easily.He made no struggle, nor did he attempt to hold on to the bedding when she stripped it from him.He lay quietly, and spoke quietly."
"“妈，没有用。”","“It ain’t no use, ma.”"
"“你要迟到了。”母亲说道，她以为他还睡得稀里糊涂的。","“You’ll be late,” she said, under the impression that he was still stupid with sleep."
"“妈，我醒着呢，我已经告诉你了，这没有用的。你最好别管我。我不会起来的。”","“I’m awake, ma, an’ I tell you it ain’t no use.You might as well lemme alone.I ain’t goin’ to git up.”"
"“你会丢掉工作的！”她大喊。","“But you’ll lose your job!” she cried."
"“我不会起来的。”他用一种奇怪的、毫无情感的声音重复了一遍。","“I ain’t goin’ to git up,” he repeated in a strange, passionless voice."
"那天早晨她自己也没有去上工。这种毛病她真的从来没有见过。发热和昏迷她倒是懂得的，可这是精神错乱啊。她给约翰尼盖好被子，叫珍妮去请医生。","She did not go to work herself that morning.This was sickness beyond any sickness she had ever known.Fever and delirium she could understand; but this was insanity.She pulled the bedding up over him and sent Jennie for the doctor."
"医生来的时候，他睡得很安稳。他慢慢地醒过来，让医生给他把脉。","When that person arrived, Johnny was sleeping gently, and gently he awoke and allowed his pulse to be taken."
"“他没有什么问题，”医生说，“就是身体太虚弱了，没有别的毛病。身上净是骨头，没有肉。”","“Nothing the matter with him,” the doctor reported.“Badly debilitated, that’s all.Not much meat on his bones.”"
"“他一直都是这样的。”母亲主动说道。","“He’s always been that way,” his mother volunteered."
"“妈，你出去吧，让我睡完这一觉吧。”","“Now go ’way, ma, an’ let me finish my snooze.”"
"约翰尼声音柔和而平静。然后他同样柔和而平静地侧过身，又睡着了。","Johnny spoke sweetly and placidly, and sweetly and placidly he rolled over on his side and went to sleep."
"十点钟，他醒来穿上衣服。他走出来进了厨房，发现母亲脸上带着一种恐惧的表情。","At ten o’clock he awoke and dressed himself.He walked out into the kitchen, where he found his mother with a frightened expression on her face."
"“妈，我要走了，”他说道，“我想跟你说声再会。”她用围裙蒙着脸，突然坐下去，哭了起来。他耐心地等着。","“I’m goin’ away, ma,” he announced, “an’ I jes’ want to say good-by.”She threw her apron over her head and sat down suddenly and wept.He waited patiently."
"“我早就知道有这么一天。”她抽噎着。","“I might a-known it,” she was sobbing."
"她拉下脸上的围裙，愁苦却几乎毫不惊奇地抬头盯着他，最后她问道：“你要去哪里？”","“Where?” she finally asked, removing the apron from her head and gazing up at him with a stricken face in which there was little curiosity."
"“我不知道——随便哪里吧。”","“I don’t know—anywhere.”"
"他一面说着，一面觉得街对面的那棵树在他的心里似乎放出了耀眼的光。那棵树就好像藏在他的眼皮底下，无论什么时候，只要他想，就会看见。","As he spoke, the tree across the street appeared with dazzling brightness on his inner vision.It seemed to lurk just under his eyelids, and he could see it whenever he wished."
"“那你的活儿呢？”她声音颤抖地问。","“An’ your job?” she quavered."
"“我不想再干活了。”","“I ain’t never goin’ to work again.”"
"“上帝啊，约翰尼！”她哀号着，“不能说这种话啊！”","“My God, Johnny!” she wailed, “don’t say that!”"
"对她来讲，他说的话简直是亵渎神明。约翰尼的母亲听到他的话都惊呆了，就像一个母亲听到她的孩子在否认上帝一样。","What he had said was blasphemy to her.As a mother who hears her child deny God, was Johnny’s mother shocked by his words."
"“你脑子究竟怎么啦？”她问道，她想责备他，可是又没有那个勇气。","“What’s got into you, anyway?” she demanded, with a lame attempt at imperativeness."
"“数目，”他回答道，“就是那些数目。这周我一直在计算好多数目，结果很是惊人。”","“Figures,” he answered.“Jes’ figures.I’ve ben doin’ a lot of figurin’ this week, an’ it’s most surprisin’.”"
"“我真不知道数目跟这有什么关系。”她抽泣着说。","“I don’t see what that’s got to do with it,” she sniffled."
"约翰尼耐心地笑了笑，母亲看到他这样始终不发怒也不闹别扭，觉得更吃惊了。","Johnny smiled patiently, and his mother was aware of a distinct shock at the persistent absence of his peevishness and irritability."
"“我跟你说吧，”他说道，“我累坏了。什么让我累成这样呢？动作。我从生下来就在做动作。我已经厌倦了动作，我再也不想做那些动作了。还记得我在玻璃厂干活的时候吗？那时候我一天扎三百打的瓶子。现在算来，我扎一个瓶子大概要十个不同的动作。这样，一天就是三万六千个动作。十天就是三十六万个动作。一个月就是一百万零八千个动作。去掉那八千个不算”——他用慈善家做好事的自满口气说——“去掉八千个不算，一个月就是整整一百万个动作——一年就是一千二百万个动作。","“I’ll show you,” he said.“I’m plum’ tired out.What makes me tired?Moves.I’ve ben movin’ ever since I was born.I’m tired of movin’, an’ I ain’t goin’ to move any more.Remember when I worked in the glass-house?I used to do three hundred dozen a day.Now I reckon I made about ten different moves to each bottle.That’s thirty-six thousan’ moves a day.Ten days, three hundred an’ sixty thousan’ moves a day.One month, one million an’ eighty thousan’ moves.Chuck out the eighty thousan’”—he spoke with the complacent beneficence of a philanthropist—“chuck out the eighty thousan’, that leaves a million moves a month—twelve million moves a year."
"“进了织布车间以后，我的动作快了一倍。这样一年就两千五百万个动作，像这样我动了将近一百万年似的。","“At the looms I’m movin’ twic’st as much.That makes twenty-five million moves a year, an’ it seems to me I’ve ben a movin’ that way ‘most a million years."
"“可是，这个星期，我一点儿也没有动。一连几个小时里，我一动不动。我跟你说吧，真是太好了，我就在那儿坐着，一连几个小时，什么也不用做。以前我从来没有这么快乐过。我从来都没有空闲。我一直都在工作。我根本没有办法让自己快活。我再也不想干活儿了。我只想坐着，坐着，休息，休息，再多休息一会儿。”","“Now this week I ain’t moved at all.I ain’t made one move in hours an’ hours.I tell you it was swell, jes’ settin’ there, hours an’ hours, an’ doin’ nothin’.I ain’t never ben happy before.I never had any time.I’ve ben movin’ all the time.That ain’t no way to be happy.An’ I ain’t goin’ to do it any more.I’m jes’ goin’ to set, an’ set, an’ rest, an’ rest, and then rest some more.”"
"“但是威尔，还有其他的孩子怎么办呢？”她绝望地问着。","“But what’s goin’ to come of Will an’ the children?” she asked despairingly."
"“对，威尔和其他的孩子。”他重复着。","“That’s it, ‘Will an’ the children,’” he repeated."
"但他的声音里没有悲伤的语气。他早就知道母亲为他弟弟所费的苦心，但是想到这种事他再也不痛心了。再也没有什么关系了。甚至他都不把这些事情放在心上了。","But there was no bitterness in his voice.He had long known his mother’s ambition for the younger boy, but the thought of it no longer rankled.Nothing mattered any more.Not even that."
"“妈，我知道你为威尔做的打算——让他继续读书，然后做一个管帐员。但是没有用了，我不干了。他必须去干活。”","“I know, ma, what you’ve ben plannin’ for Will—keepin’ him in school to make a bookkeeper out of him.But it ain’t no use, I’ve quit.He’s got to go to work.”"
"“我把你抚养成人，你就这样啊。”她哭着说，想用围裙蒙脸来着，可是又改变了主意。","“An’ after I have brung you up the way I have,” she wept, starting to cover her head with the apron and changing her mind."
"“你根本没有把我抚养成人，”他用悲凉而又温和的口气说着，“是我把自己抚养长大的，妈，而且我抚养了威尔长大。他块头比我大，比我重，也比我高。我想我小的时候就没有吃饱过。他出世以后只有几岁的时候，我就开始干活，赚钱养活他了。不过已经结束了。威尔可以去干活了，像我一样，或者随他吧，反正我不在乎了。我累了。我现在要走了。你都不跟我说声再会吗？”","“You never brung me up,” he answered with sad kindliness. “I brung myself up, ma, an’ I brung up Will.He’s bigger’n me, an’ heavier, an’ taller.When I was a kid, I reckon I didn’t git enough to eat.When he come along an’ was a kid, I was workin’ an’ earnin’ grub for him too.But that’s done with.Will can go to work, same as me, or he can go to hell, I don’t care which.I’m tired.I’m goin’ now.Ain’t you goin’ to say good-by?”"
"她没有回答。她又用围裙蒙住脸，大哭了起来。走到门口的时候，他停了一下。","She made no reply.The apron had gone over her head again, and she was crying.He paused a moment in the doorway."
"“我肯定我尽了力。”她啜泣着。","“I’m sure I done the best I knew how,” she was sobbing."
"他走出了房子，到了大街上。看见那棵孤单的树，他的脸上露出了一副凄凉的笑容。“我什么也不干了。”他自言自语着，用有些响亮，又似低声哼唱的语气说道。他若有所思地看了看天，耀眼的太阳照得他眼都花了。","He passed out of the house and down the street.A wan delight came into his face at the sight of the lone tree.“Jes’ ain’t goin’ to do nothin’,” he said to himself, half aloud, in a crooning tone.He glanced wistfully up at the sky, but the bright sun dazzled and blinded him."
"他走了很久，但是走得不快。他顺路走过了麻纺厂。织布车间里闷闷的轰隆声传到他的耳朵里，他微微地笑了。那是轻柔的、宁静的微笑。他谁都不恨，甚至不恨那些砰砰作响、震耳欲聋的机器。他的心中没有伤悲，只是极度渴望休息。","It was a long walk he took, and he did not walk fast.It took him past the jute-mill.The muffled roar of the loom room came to his ears, and he smiled.It was a gentle, placid smile.He hated no one, not even the pounding, shrieking machines.There was no bitterness in him, nothing but an inordinate hunger for rest."
"房屋和工厂逐渐稀少了，空旷的地方越来越多，这时他已经快到乡下了。最后，城市在他身后了。他沿着铁路旁一条树木茂盛的小路走去。他走得不像人。他看起来也不像人。他就是对人类的一种嘲弄。他好像个身子扭曲歪斜、发育不良、说不出名堂的活物。他踉踉跄跄地走着，两只胳膊松松垮垮，弓着肩，窄胸膛，样子古怪又可怕，活像一只生病的猿猴。","The houses and factories thinned out and the open spaces increased as he approached the country.At last the city was behind him, and he was walking down a leafy lane beside the railroad track.He did not walk like a man.He did not look like a man.He was a travesty of the human.It was a twisted and stunted and nameless piece of life that shambled like a sickly ape, arms loose-hanging, stoop-shouldered, narrow-chested, grotesque and terrible."
"他路过了一个小火车站，然后便躺到一棵树下的草地上。整个下午他都躺在那儿。有时他打起盹来，他的肌肉在睡梦中抽搐着。醒过来的时候，他一动不动地躺在那儿看着鸟儿，或透过树枝的缝隙看着上面的天空。有一两次，他大笑了起来，不过这跟他看到或感觉到的东西没有任何关系。","He passed by a small railroad station and lay down in the grass under a tree.All afternoon he lay there.Sometimes he dozed, with muscles that twitched in his sleep.When awake, he lay without movement, watching the birds or looking up at the sky through the branches of the tree above him.Once or twice he laughed aloud, but without relevance to anything he had seen or felt."
"黄昏逝去，夜色刚刚降临。一列货车隆隆地驶入车站。当这列货车在岔道上转轨时，约翰尼沿着火车的一侧爬了上去。他拉开一节空车厢的侧门，笨拙地、吃力地爬了进去。他关上了门。火车的汽笛响了。　约翰尼躺了下去，在黑暗中，他笑了。","After twilight had gone, in the first darkness of the night, a freight train rumbled into the station.When the engine was switching cars on to the side-track, Johnny crept along the side of the train.He pulled open the side-door of an empty box-car and awkwardly and laboriously climbed in.He closed the door.The engine whistled.Johnny was lying down, and in the darkness he smiled."
