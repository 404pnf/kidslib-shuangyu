"三叶草和棕榈树","Shamrock and the Palm"
"作者：欧·亨利","by O. Henry"
"一个无风的晚上，科拉里奥仿佛比以往都更加接近地狱的格子门，五个男人聚在“基奥和克兰西照相馆”门前。在世界上那些炎热而又有异域情调的地方，高加索人常在干完一天的活后聚在一起，讽刺一下外国的种种，借以完整地保存他们的传统。","One night when there was no breeze, and Coralio seemed closer than ever to the gratings of Avernus, five men were grouped about the door of the photograph establishment of Keogh and Clancy.Thus, in all the scorched and exotic places of the earth, Caucasians meet when the day’s work is done to preserve the fulness of their heritage by the aspersion of alien things."
"约翰尼·阿特伍德穿着加勒比人的便服在草地上舒展着身体，懒懒地唠叨着用戴尔斯堡的黄瓜木水泵打出来的凉水。格雷格医生，借着他那络腮胡子的威望和即将要讲述的行业故事，得到照顾，独享了那个在门侧柱和葫芦树之间摇晃的吊床。基奥把一张小桌子搬到外面草地上，桌子上放着一件工具，这是专门给弄好的照片抛光用的。他是这群人中唯一在忙碌的人。科拉里奥市民们的照片源源不断地从抛光器的圆筒中滚出来。布朗夏尔，那个法国煤矿工程师，穿着凉爽的亚麻衣，戴着眼镜，安详地看着自己抽烟吐出的烟雾，对于天气的炎热也满不在乎。克兰西坐在台阶上，抽着他的短烟斗。从他的神情可以看出他想聊天；由于天气闷湿，其他人则懒得开口说话，只乐意做听众。","Johnny Atwood lay stretched upon the grass in the undress uniform of a Carib, and prated feebly of cool water to be had in the cucumber-wood pumps of Dalesburg.Doctor Gregg, through the prestige of his whiskers and as a bribe against the relation of his imminent professional tales, was conceded the hammock that was swung between the door jamb and a calabash-tree.Keogh had moved out upon the grass a little table that held the instrument for burnishing completed photographs.He was the only busy one of the group.Industriously from between the cylinders of the burnisher rolled the finished depictments of Coralio’s citizens.Blanchard, the French mining engineer, in his cool linen viewed the smoke of his cigarette through his calm glasses, impervious to the heat.Clancy sat on the steps, smoking his short pipe.His mood was the gossip’s; the others were reduced, by the humidity, to the state of disability desirable in an audience."
"克兰西是个美国人，但是同时也具有爱尔兰人的特质和四海为家的癖性。他从事过多种职业，但是每一种都干得不长。他血管里流淌着浪子的血液。锡板照相只是他众多愿望中的一个罢了，这些想法让他经历了太多不同的行当。有时会有人劝他讲讲自己的旅行经历，尽管他只是随便讲讲，但讲得异乎寻常。今晚，他看上去就很想一吐为快。","Clancy was an American with an Irish diathesis and cosmopolitan proclivities.Many businesses had claimed him, but not for long.The roadster’s blood was in his veins.The voice of the tintype was but one of the many callings that had wooed him upon so many roads.Sometimes he could be persuaded to oral construction of his voyages into the informal and egregious.Tonight there were symptoms of divulgement in him."
"“这样的天气最适合搞叛乱了。”他自己开口说道，“这让我想起了那次我用尽全力从一位暴君的魔掌中解放一个国家的情形。那可是很难的事情。累得我腰酸背痛，胼手胝足。”","“’Tis elegant weather for filibustering,” he volunteered.“It reminds me of the time I struggled to liberate a nation from the poisonous breath of a tyrant’s clutch.’Twas hard work.’Tis straining to the back and makes corns on the hands.”"
"“我从不知道你还曾把你的剑借给了一个受压迫的民族。”阿特伍德在草地上喃喃道。","“I didn’t know you had ever lent your sword to an oppressed people,” murmured Atwood, from the grass."
"“我的确干过，”克兰西说，“可是他们把我的剑当成犁头用。”","“I did,” said Clancy; “and they turned it into a plowshare.”"
"“哪个国家能如此幸运地得到你的帮助？”布朗夏尔漫不经心地问道。","“What country was so fortunate as to secure your aid?” airily inquired Blanchard."
"“堪察加半岛在哪儿？”克兰西问了个看似不相干的问题。","“Where’s Kamchatka?” asked Clancy, with seeming irrelevance."
"“唔，在北极区西伯利亚的什么地方。”有人迟疑地答道。","“Why, off Siberia somewhere in the Arctic regions,” somebody answered, doubtfully."
"“我想是那个寒冷的地方。”克兰西说着，满意地点了点头。“我总是弄混那两个地名。那么应该是危地马拉——那个炎热的地方——我在那里搞过叛乱。你们在地图上可以找到那个国家。它位于大家公认的热带地区。老天有先见之明，让它位于海岸边，这样可以让绘地图的人把城镇的名字标在旁边的水域中。这些名字有一英寸长，是小写字体，全用西班牙方言写成。依我看来，所用的句法体系与炸毁的缅因号上的体系相同。是的，我单枪匹马朝着那个国家逆风航行，试图用一把在那儿卸下的单管镐把它从暴虐的政府中解放出来。你们当然不明白。这话需要进一步解释一下。","“I thought that was the cold one,” said Clancy, with a satisfied nod.“I’m always gettin’ the two names mixed.’Twas Guatemala, then—the hot one—I’ve been filibusterin’ with.Ye’ll find that country on the map.’Tis in the district known as the tropics.By the foresight of Providence, it lies on the coast so the geography men could run the names of the towns off into the water.They’re an inch long, small type, composed of Spanish dialects, and, ’tis my opinion, of the same system of syntax that blew up the Maine.Yes, ’twas that country I sailed against, single-handed, and endeavored to liberate it from a tyrannical government with a single-barrelled pickaxe, unloaded at that.Ye don’t understand, of course.’Tis a statement demandin’ elucidation and apologies."
"“那是在新奥尔良的一个早晨，大约是六月一号；我正站在码头上眺望着河上的船只。在我的正对面，停泊着一条似乎正准备起航的小轮船。船的烟囱喷着烟，一伙码头工人正往船上搬堆在码头的一堆箱子。那些箱子约摸有两英尺见方，大概四英尺长，看起来挺沉的。","“’Twas in New Orleans one morning about the first of June; I was standing down on the wharf, looking about at the ships in the river.There was a little steamer moored right opposite me that seemed about ready to sail.The funnels of it were throwing out smoke, and a gang of roustabouts were carrying aboard a pile of boxes that was stacked up on the wharf.The boxes were about two feet square, and something like four feet long, and they seemed to be pretty heavy."
"“我漫不经心地走到那堆箱子旁边。看到其中有一个在搬运时破损了。出于好奇，我掀开松动的盖子，看了看里面。箱子里装满了温切斯特来复枪。‘哦，哦，’我自言自语道，‘有人正在干违反中立法的事。有人正在搞军火援助这种勾当。我想知道这些枪支是要运到哪儿去的。","“I walked over, careless, to the stack of boxes.I saw one of them had been broken in handlin’.’Twas curiosity made me pull up the loose top and look inside.The box was packed full of Winchester rifles.‘So, so,’ says I to myself; ‘somebody’s gettin’ a twist on the neutrality laws.Somebody’s aidin’ with munitions of war.I wonder where the popguns are goin’?’"
"“我听到有人咳嗽了一声，就转过身去。站在那儿的是一个身材滚圆的矮胖子，棕色面孔，白色衣服，是个长相一流的小个子男人。他手指上戴着一只四克拉的钻戒，眼里充满了疑虑和尊敬。我判断他应该是个外国人——可能来自俄国或者日本，或是来自爱琴海群岛。","“I heard somebody cough, and I turned around.There stood a little, round, fat man with a brown face and white clothes, a first-class-looking little man, with a four-karat diamond on his finger and his eye full of interrogations and respects.I judged he was a kind of foreigner—may be from Russia or Japan or the archipelagoes."
"“‘嘘！’那个圆胖的男人充满神秘与信任地叫道。‘先生，您会对您的发现保密，不让船上的人知道吧？先生是位君子，对于偶然发生的事，一定不会泄露出去的。’","“‘Hist!’ says the round man, full of concealments and confidences.‘Will the senor respect the discoveryments he has made, that the mans on the ship shall not be acquaint?The senor will be a gentleman that shall not expose one thing that by accident occur.’"
"“‘先生，’我说——因为我断定他应该是个法国人——‘请您完全放心，您的秘密在我詹姆斯·克兰西这儿是绝对安全的。而且，我还敢进一步高呼自由万岁——祝愿自由美好而强大。无论你何时听到有个叫克兰西的人阻碍废除现任政府，你都可以回信通知我。’","“‘Monseer,’ says I—for I judged him to be a kind of Frenchman—‘receive my most exasperated assurances that your secret is safe with James Clancy.Furthermore, I will go so far as to remark, Veev la Liberty—veev it good and strong.Whenever you hear of a Clancy obstructin’ the abolishment of existin’ governments you may notify me by return mail.’"
"“‘先生真好，’那个又黑又胖的男人说，黑色的胡子下透着微笑的表情，‘希望您能到我船上喝杯酒。’","“‘The senor is good,’ says the dark, fat man, smilin’ under his black mustache.‘Wish you to come aboard my ship and drink of wine a glass.’"
"“作为克兰西，两分钟后，我便与这位外国人坐在了船舱里的一张小桌旁边，一瓶酒摆在我们中间。我能听到沉甸甸的箱子被卸到船舱里的声音。我断定那批货至少有2000支温切斯特枪。我和那个棕褐色男人喝完一瓶，他叫乘务员又拿来一瓶。当你把克兰西和瓶里那东西混在一块时，实际上你是在煽动分裂。我已经听到过很多关于热带地区革命的事情，我也开始想参与一下。","“Bein’ a Clancy, in two minutes me and the foreigner man were seated at a table in the cabin of the steamer, with a bottle between us.I could hear the heavy boxes bein’ dumped into the hold.I judged that cargo must consist of at least 2,000 Winchesters.Me and the brown man drank the bottle of stuff, and he called the steward to bring another.When you amalgamate a Clancy with the contents of a bottle you practically instigate secession.I had heard a good deal about these revolutions in them tropical localities, and I begun to want a hand in it."
"“‘你打算在你们国家发动革命，是不是，先生？’我说着，对他眨眨眼以表示我很感兴趣。","“‘You goin’ to stir things up in your country, ain’t you, monseer?’ says I, with a wink to let him know I was on."
"“‘是的，是的，’小个子说着，拳头重重地砸在桌子上。‘不久将要发生一场最伟大的变革。人民忍受压迫的时间太长了，只听到了承诺却从来没看到它们兑现过。伟大的事业就要进行了。是的。我们的力量很快就要在首都举行罢工。他妈的！’","“‘Yes, yes,’ said the little man, pounding his fist on the table.‘A change of the greatest will occur.Too long have the people been oppressed with the promises and the never-to-happen things to become.The great work it shall be carry on.Yes.Our forces shall in the capital city strike of the soonest.Carrambos!’"
"“‘他妈的，说得好，’我说着，自己开始有点激动，酒越喝越多，‘就像我刚才说的万岁一样恰当。希望古老的三叶草——我是指香蕉藤或食用大黄，或是指代表你们这个受压迫的国家的任何威严的标志，永远飘扬。’","“‘Carrambos is the word,’ says I, beginning to invest myself with enthusiasm and more wine, ‘likewise veeva, as I said before.May the shamrock of old—I mean the banana-vine or the pie-plant, or whatever the imperial emblem may be of your down-trodden country, wave forever.’"
"“‘非常感谢，’那个圆乎乎的家伙说，‘感谢你这善意的话。我们的事业最需要的是愿意做这项工作，并且能够推动它的人。啊，如果有一千个强壮的好汉帮助德维加将军，他就可以把成功与荣誉带给他的国家！这很难——哎，找到好汉来从事这项工作太难了。’","“‘A thousand thank-yous,’ says the round man, ‘for your emission of amicable utterances.What our cause needs of the very most is mans who will the work do, to lift it along.Oh, for one thousands strong, good mans to aid the General De Vega that he shall to his country bring those success and glory!It is hard—oh, so hard to find good mans to help in the work.’"
"“‘先生，’我倚着桌子握住他的手说，‘我不知道你的国家在哪儿，但是我的心在为它滴血。我克兰西看到受压迫的民族，从来不会袖手旁观。克兰西家族的人生来就是搞叛乱的，以做外国人为生。如果你在解放暴君束缚下的海岸时用得着詹姆斯·克兰西的臂膀和鲜血，它们将服从您的命令。’","“‘Monseer,’ says I, leanin’ over the table and graspin’ his hand, ‘I don’t know where your country is, but me heart bleeds for it.The heart of a Clancy was never deaf to the sight of an oppressed people.The family is filibusterers by birth, and foreigners by trade.If you can use James Clancy’s arms and his blood in denuding your shores of the tyrant’s yoke they’re yours to command.’"
"“德维加将军非常高兴地接受了我对他的阴谋及困境的同情。他想隔着桌子就拥抱我，但因肥胖和那两瓶酒，他未能做到。就这样我被欢迎加入到了叛乱的队伍中。然后，那位将军告诉我他的国家叫危地马拉，是被海水冲刷着的最伟大的国家。他噙着眼泪看着我，不时地嚷道：‘啊！高大、强壮、勇敢的人！我的国家正需要这样的人。’","“General De Vega was overcome with joy to confiscate my condolence of his conspiracies and predicaments.He tried to embrace me across the table, but his fatness, and the wine that had been in the bottles, prevented.Thus was I welcomed into the ranks of filibustery.Then the general man told me his country had the name of Guatemala, and was the greatest nation laved by any ocean whatever anywhere.He looked at me with tears in his eyes, and from time to time he would emit the remark, ‘Ah!big, strong, brave mans!That is what my country need.’"
"“德维加将军，这是他自称的名字，拿出一份文件让我签字，我照办了，并用‘y’这个字母的尾巴写出了一个优美的花体字。","“General De Vega, as was the name by which he denounced himself, brought out a document for me to sign, which I did, makin’ a fine flourish and curlycue with the tail of the ‘y.’"
"“‘你的船费，’将军一本正经地说道，‘将来从你的薪水里扣除。’","“‘Your passage-money,’ says the general, business-like, ‘shall from your pay be deduct.’"
"“‘不必了，’我高傲地说，‘我自己付船费。’我内口袋里装着一百八十美元，我不是一个普普通通的为了衣食去搞叛乱的人。","“‘’Twill not,’ says I, haughty.‘I’ll pay my own passage.’A hundred and eighty dollars I had in my inside pocket, and ’twas no common filibuster I was goin’ to be, filibusterin’ for me board and clothes."
"“轮船将在两个小时后起航，于是我上岸去拿一些必需的东西。回到船上时，我自豪地向将军展示我的全套行头。一件优质的栗鼠呢大衣、北极的罩靴、皮帽、御寒耳套、精致的羊皮手套还有羊绒衬里的围巾。","“The steamer was to sail in two hours, and I went ashore to get some things together I’d need.When I came aboard I showed the general with pride the outfit.’Twas a fine Chinchilla overcoat, Arctic overshoes, fur cap and earmuffs, with elegant fleece-lined gloves and woollen muffler."
"“‘他妈的！’小个子将军说道，‘到热带去怎么用得上这些衣服？’然后听到那个小伙子哈哈大笑，他叫来船长，船长叫来事务长，他们又叫来轮机长，一帮家伙倚靠着船舱，嘲笑着克兰西要带到危地马拉去的全身行头。","“‘Carrambos!’says the little general.‘What clothes are these that shall go to the tropic?’And then the little spalpeen laughs, and he calls the captain, and the captain calls the purser, and they pipe up the chief engineer, and the whole gang leans against the cabin and laughs at Clancy’s wardrobe for Guatemala."
"“我认真地想了一下，再次问将军他的国家到底叫什么名字。他告诉了我，我才知道原来我记住的是另一个名字：堪察加。从那以后，我总是分不清这两个国家的名字、气候及地理位置。","“I reflects a bit, serious, and asks the general again to denominate the terms by which his country is called.He tells me, and I see then that ’twas the t’other one, Kamchatka, I had in mind.Since then I’ve had difficulty in separatin’ the two nations in name, climate and geographic disposition."
"“我付了我的船费——24美元，头等舱——和那些官员级别的人同桌吃饭。甲板下层是一群二等旅客，约四十来人，看起来像南欧外国佬。我不明白他们这么多人去干什么。","“I paid my passage—twenty-four dollars, first cabin—and ate at table with the officer crowd.Down on the lower deck was a gang of second-class passengers, about forty of them, seemin’ to be Dagoes and the like.I wondered what so many of them were goin’ along for."
"“于是，三天后我们沿着危地马拉海岸航行。‘那是一个青翠碧绿的国家，并不是地图上标错的黄色。我们在沿海的小镇上岸，在那里的一条小铁路上停着一列在等我们的火车。工人们把轮船上的箱子搬上岸，装进火车。那伙外国佬也上了车，我和将军上了最前面的车厢。嗯，当火车驶出港口小镇时，我和德维加将军领导着革命。火车的速度就像警察前去镇压暴乱一样快。它穿过了一片在地图上从没见过的最明显的模糊地带。七个小时后我们跑了大约四十英里，火车这才停了下来。前方没有铁路了。在布满荒凉景象的、令人忧郁、潮湿的山谷里有个营地。人们边砍伐森林边修整土地，继续向前铺设道路。‘这里，’我自言自语道，‘是革命家理想的藏身之处。在这儿，我克兰西将凭借着优越的民族传统，以及芬尼亚战术的反复教育，为了自由猛烈出击。’","“Well, then, in three days we sailed alongside that Guatemala.’Twas a blue country, and not yellow as ’tis miscolored on the map.We landed at a town on the coast, where a train of cars was waitin’ for us on a dinky little railroad.The boxes on the steamer were brought ashore and loaded on the cars.The gang of Dagoes got aboard, too, the general and me in the front car.Yes, me and General De Vega headed the revolution, as it pulled out of the seaport town.That train travelled about as fast as a policeman goin’ to a riot.It penetrated the most conspicuous lot of fuzzy scenery ever seen outside a geography.We run some forty miles in seven hours, and the train stopped.There was no more railroad.’Twas a sort of camp in a damp gorge full of wildness and melancholies.They was grading and choppin’ out the forests ahead to continue the road.‘Here,’ says I to myself, ‘is the romantic haunt of the revolutionists.Here will Clancy, by the virtue that is in a superior race and the inculcation of Fenian tactics, strike a tremendous blow for liberty.’"
"“他们从火车上卸下那些箱子，开始撬开箱盖。我看到德维加将军从第一个打开的箱子里取出温切斯特来复枪，分发给一小队病怏怏的士兵。其他的箱子也依次被打开，不管你信不信，再也没看到一支枪。其他每个箱子都装满了鹤嘴锄和铁锹。","“They unloaded the boxes from the train and begun to knock the tops off.From the first one that was open I saw General De Vega take the Winchester rifles and pass them around to a squad of morbid soldiery.The other boxes was opened next, and, believe me or not, divil another gun was to be seen.Every other box in the load was full of pickaxes and spades."
"“接着——这热带的上空罩满了悲哀——志高气傲的克兰西和那些受侮辱的外国佬，每个人都得扛起一把鹤嘴锄或铁锹去铺设那条肮脏的小铁路。是的；那些外国佬坐船来这儿就是为了这件事，想搞叛乱的克兰西签字也是为了这事，虽然当时他并不知情。后来我才弄明白。似乎很难找到人来修这条路。那些聪明的当地人太懒，不愿意来干活。的确，那些圣人知道，他们不必干活。他们只要伸出一只手，就能摘到世界上最可口最名贵的水果，伸出另一只手就能一下睡几天，而听不到七点钟的汽笛声或收租人上楼梯的脚步声。所以，轮船会定期地开往美国去引诱劳工。通常，这些从国外输入的劳工在这里喝了煮得过开的水，再加上热带地区环境恶劣，他们生活在这里两三个月后就会死掉。因此他们雇佣工人时，勒令他们签一年的合同，然后派上武装警卫监视这些可怜的家伙们以防止他们逃跑。","“And then—sorrow be upon them tropics—the proud Clancy and the dishonored Dagoes, each one of them, had to shoulder a pick or a spade, and march away to work on that dirty little railroad.Yes; ’twas that the Dagoes shipped for, and ’twas that the filibusterin’ Clancy signed for, though unbeknownst to himself at the time.In after days I found out about it.It seems ’twas hard to get hands to work on that road.The intelligent natives of the country was too lazy to work.Indeed, the saints know, ’twas unnecessary.By stretchin’ out one hand, they could seize the most delicate and costly fruits of the earth, and, by stretchin’ out the other, they could sleep for days at a time without hearin’ a seven o’clock whistle or the footsteps of the rent man upon the stairs.So, regular, the steamers travelled to the United States to seduce labor.Usually the imported spade-slingers died in two or three months from eatin’ the over-ripe water and breathing the violent tropical scenery.Wherefore they made them sign contracts for a year, when they hired them, and put an armed guard over the poor devils to keep them from runnin’ away."
"“‘我之所以中了热带地区的圈套，是由于家族没有改掉自找麻烦的习惯。","“’Twas thus I was double-crossed by the tropics through a family failing of goin’ out of the way to hunt disturbances."
"“他们给我一把锄，我接过来，心想着就地发动一场暴乱；但是那些警卫满不在乎地拿着温切斯特枪，我得出结论，谨慎考虑对搞叛乱最重要。我们一伙大约有一百多人去干活，出发的命令已经发出。我走出队列，走近德维加将军。他正在抽雪茄，心满意足地注视着眼前的场景。他冲我笑笑，客气却很邪恶。他说道：‘危地马拉有足够的工作提供给高大强壮的人。是的。每个月发30美元。好工钱。啊，是的。你这个强壮勇敢的人。我们会很快把铁路修到首都去。现在他们要你去干活了。再会了，强壮的人。’","“They gave me a pick, and I took it, meditating an insurrection on the spot; but there was the guards handling the Winchesters careless, and I come to the conclusion that discretion was the best part of filibusterin’.There was about a hundred of us in the gang starting out to work, and the word was given to move.I steps out of the ranks and goes up to that General De Vega man, who was smokin’ a cigar and gazin’ upon the scene with satisfactions and glory.He smiles at me polite and devilish.‘Plenty work,’ says he, ‘for big, strong mans in Guatemala.Yes.Thirty dollars in the month.Good pay.Ah, yes.You strong, brave man.Bimeby we push those railroad in the capital very quick.They want you go work now.Adios, strong mans.’"
"“‘先生，’我说，想逗留一会儿，‘你能否告诉一个可怜渺小的爱尔兰人：当我踏上你那满是蟑螂的轮船，一边喝你的酸酒一边倾泻自由和革命的情感时，你认为我的目的是来你这瞧不起人的小铁路上扛鹤嘴锄吗？当你向我讲述你的爱国豪言，为了辉煌的自由事业努力时，你是不是已经盘算好把我贬到这些翻掘树桩的外国佬的行列中，一起被链锁束缚在你这肮脏无耻的国家里呢？’","“‘Monseer,’ says I, lingerin’, ‘will you tell a poor little Irishman this: When I set foot on your cockroachy steamer, and breathed liberal and revolutionary sentiments into your sour wine, did you think I was conspirin’ to sling a pick on your contemptuous little railroad?And when you answered me with patriotic recitations, humping up the star-spangled cause of liberty, did you have meditations of reducin’ me to the ranks of the stump-grubbin’ Dagoes in the chain-gangs of your vile and grovelin’ country?’"
"“那个将军伸伸他滚圆的身体，大笑起来。是的，他笑了很长时间，声音很大，而我，克兰西却站着等候。","“The general man expanded his rotundity and laughed considerable.Yes, he laughed very long and loud, and I, Clancy, stood and waited."
"“‘这人真好笑！’最后他吼道，‘你会让我笑死的。是的，是很难找到这样勇敢、强壮的人来帮助我的国家。革命？我说过革—革—革命吗？从来没提到过一个字。我说的是，危地马拉需要高大结实的人。确实如此。只能怪你自己。你只看到了一箱给警卫用的枪。你以为所有的箱子里都是枪吗？不是的。’","“‘Comical mans!’ he shouts, at last.‘So you will kill me from the laughing.Yes; it is hard to find the brave, strong mans to aid my country.Revolutions?Did I speak of r-r-revolutions?Not one word.I say, big, strong man is need in Guatemala.So.The mistake is of you.You have looked in those one box containing those gun for the guard.You think all boxes is contain gun?No. "
"“‘在危地马拉不存在战争。至于工作？是的。很好。每个月三十美元。你得扛起锄头，先生，为了危地马拉的自由与繁荣挖地去吧。去干活吧。警卫在等你。’","“‘There is not war in Guatemala.But work?Yes.Good.Thirty dollar in the month.You shall shoulder one pickaxe, senor, and dig for the liberty and prosperity of Guatemala.Off to your work.The guard waits for you.’"
"“‘你这臃肿的棕色小肥狗，’我说道，声音很小却充满愤怒和不安，‘你会得到报应的。或许不是现在，但是只要我詹姆斯·克兰西能想出对付诡辩的方式。’","“‘Little, fat, poodle dog of a brown man,’ says I, quiet, but full of indignations and discomforts, ‘things shall happen to you.Maybe not right away, but as soon as J. Clancy can formulate somethin’ in the way of repartee.’"
"“那帮家伙的工头吆喝我们去干活。我脚步沉重地跟着那些外国佬走了，走的时候我听到了那位著名爱国人士兼绑匪得意的笑声。","“The boss of the gang orders us to work.I tramps off with the Dagoes, and I hears the distinguished patriot and kidnapper laughin’ hearty as we go."
"“这是个伤心的事实，我为那个卑劣的国家修了八个星期的铁路。我每天拿着沉重的锄和铁锹干十二个钟头，毁掉挡道的精致美景。我们在沼泽地里干活，那里闻起来就像煤气泄漏的气味，脚下踩着各类最娇贵的温室植物和蔬菜。这里的热带场景连最异想天开的地理学家也想象不出。树木高耸入云，林下灌木丛里满是荆棘；猴子跳来跳去，还有鳄鱼和粉红尾巴的嘲鸫鸟，而你站在齐膝深的恶臭的水里，貌似在为解放危地马拉奠基。到了晚上，我们在营地里点起熏火来赶走蚊子，坐在烟雾中，周围有警卫在来回走动。有两百人在这铁路上做工——大多数是南欧人、黑人、西班牙人和瑞典人。爱尔兰人有三四个。","“’Tis a sorrowful fact, for eight weeks I built railroads for that misbehavin’ country.I filibustered twelve hours a day with a heavy pick and a spade, choppin’ away the luxurious landscape that grew upon the right of way.We worked in swamps that smelled like there was a leak in the gas mains, trampin’ down a fine assortment of the most expensive hothouse plants and vegetables.The scene was tropical beyond the wildest imagination of the geography man.The trees was all sky-scrapers; the underbrush was full of needles and pins; there was monkeys jumpin’ around and crocodiles and pink-tailed mockin’-birds, and ye stood knee-deep in the rotten water and grabbled roots for the liberation of Guatemala.Of nights we would build smudges in camp to discourage the mosquitoes, and sit in the smoke, with the guards pacin’ all around us.There was two hundred men working on the road—mostly Dagoes, nigger-men, Spanish-men and Swedes.Three or four were Irish."
"“有个叫哈洛伦的老人——一位具有爱尔兰人气质和谨慎作风的人，给我解释了一切。他已经在这条铁路上干了一年了。大多数人不到半年就死了。他瘦骨嶙峋，只剩下皮包骨头，每隔两晚都会冷得发抖。“‘刚来时，’他说，‘你觉得很快会离开这儿。但是他们扣下你第一个月的工钱抵作你来这儿的船费，到时候热带的一切已把你绊住了。你的周围是一片森林，各种恐怖的野兽——雄狮、狒狒和蟒蛇—正等待机会吞掉你。太阳猛烈无情地晒着你，熔化着你的骨髓。你慢慢变成诗书里所说的吃生菜的人。你会忘记高尚的生活情操，比如爱国精神、报仇、心神不宁以及对服饰的喜爱。你每天干活，还要咽下外国厨子做的带有煤油味和橡胶烟管味的饭菜。你点上烟斗，对自己说：“下周我一定要逃跑。”接着你去睡觉，说自己在撒谎，因为你知道你绝对不会那样做。’","“One old man named Halloran—a man of Hibernian entitlements and discretions, explained it to me.He had been working on the road a year.Most of them died in less than six months.He was dried up to gristle and bone, and shook with chills every third night.“‘When you first come,’ says he, ‘ye think ye’ll leave right away.But they hold out your first month’s pay for your passage over, and by that time the tropics has its grip on ye.Ye’re surrounded by a ragin’ forest full of disreputable beasts—lions and baboons and anacondas—waiting to devour ye.The sun strikes ye hard, and melts the marrow in your bones.Ye get similar to the lettuce-eaters the poetry-books speaks about.Ye forget the elevated sintiments of life, such as patriotism, revenge, disturbances of the peace and the dacint love of a clane shirt.Ye do your work, and ye swallow the kerosene ile and rubber pipestems dished up to ye by the Dago cook for food.Ye light your pipeful, and say to yourself, “Nixt week I’ll break away,” and ye go to sleep and call yersilf a liar, for ye know yell never do it.’"
"‘那个自称德维加将军的家伙是谁？’我问道。","‘Who is this general man,’ asks I, ‘that calls himself De Vega?’"
"“‘就是这个人，’哈洛伦说，‘他竭力想修完这条铁路。铁路本来是一家私人公司的工程，但是公司倒闭了，所以政府就接管了。德维加是个大政客，一心想成为总统。人民希望铁路尽快完工，因为为了修铁路他们已经蒙受了苛捐杂税的重负。德维加这家伙急于修完铁路，以此作为参加竞选的筹码。’","“’Tis the man,’ says Halloran, ‘who is tryin’ to complete the finishin’ of the railroad.’Twas the project of a private corporation, but it busted, and then the government took it up.De Vegy is a big politician, and wants to be president.The people want the railroad completed, as they’re taxed mighty on account of it.The De Vegy man is pushing it along as a campaign move.’"
"“‘威胁别人不是我的风格，’我说，‘但是这个修铁路的人和詹姆斯·奥多德·克兰西之间有笔帐要清算。’","“‘’Tis not my way,’ says I, ‘to make threats against any man, but there’s an account to be settled between the railroad man and James O’Dowd Clancy.’"
"“‘起初我也这么想过，’哈洛伦说，长叹了一声，‘后来我也成了吃生菜的人。问题就出在这些热带食物上。它们破坏了人的机体。这片土地，就像诗人说的，‘总是像吃过饭后去的地方。’”“我干活，抽烟，睡觉。总之，生活中很少有别的东西。不久后你也会变成那样的。不要有任何情绪了，克兰西。’","“‘’Twas that way I thought, mesilf, at first,’ Halloran says, with a big sigh, ‘until I got to be a lettuce-eater.The fault’s wid these tropics.They rejuices a man’s system.’Tis a land, as the poet says, “Where it always seems to be after dinner.”I does me work and smokes me pipe and sleeps.There’s little else in life, anyway.Ye’ll get that way yersilf, mighty soon.Don’t be harborin’ any sentiments at all, Clancy.’"
"“‘我办不到。’我说；我心里满是情绪。我参加的是这个黑暗国家的革命队伍，怀着为它的自由、光荣和银制烛台而战的真挚信念；相反他们却让我来破坏风景，挖掘树根。‘那个将军一定要为此付出代价。’","“‘I can’t help it,’ says I; I’m full of ‘em.I enlisted in the revolutionary army of this dark country in good faith to fight for its liberty, honors, and silver candlesticks; instead of which I am set to amputatin’ its scenery and grubbin’ its roots.’Tis the general man will have to pay for it.’"
"“我在那条铁路上干了两个月后发现了逃走的机会。一天，我们一帮人被派到已完工铁路的另一端去拿回一些被送到巴里奥斯港口打磨的鹤嘴锄。它们是装在手摇车里带回来的，离开时，我注意到那辆车还留在轨道上。”","“Two months I worked on that railroad before I found a chance to get away.One day a gang of us was sent back to the end of the completed line to fetch some picks that had been sent down to Port Barrios to be sharpened.They were brought on a hand-car, and I noticed, when I started away, that the car was left there on the track."
"“那天晚上，大约十二点钟，我弄醒哈洛伦，把我的计划告诉他。","“That night, about twelve, I woke up Halloran and told him my scheme."
"“‘逃走？’哈洛伦说。‘天哪，克兰西，你真有这个打算？唉，我可没有那个胆量。太冷了，我还没睡够。逃走？我跟你说过，克兰西，我已经吃了生菜。我没力气了。这得怪热带。就像诗人说的：“被忘却的是被我们被抛下的朋友；在这空虚的生菜之地，我们生活，我们繁衍。”你自己走吧，克兰西。我想，我还是留下来。时间太早，天太冷了，而且我很困。’","“‘Run away?’ says Halloran.‘Good Lord, Clancy, do ye mean it?Why, I ain’t got the nerve.It’s too chilly, and I ain’t slept enough.Run away?I told you, Clancy, I’ve eat the lettuce.I’ve lost my grip.’Tis the tropics that’s done it.’Tis like the poet says: “Forgotten are our friends that we have left behind; in the hollow lettuce-land we will live and lay reclined.”You better go on, Clancy.I’ll stay, I guess.It’s too early and cold, and I’m sleepy.’"
"“所以我不得不留下哈洛伦。我悄悄地穿好衣服，偷偷溜出我们住的帐篷。警卫出现时，我用一只预备好的生椰子把他打晕，他像根木柱一样倒下了，随后我便向铁路跑去。我上了那辆手摇车，让它像飞似的跑起来。黎明前还有一会儿时，我看到了大约一里外的巴里奥斯港的灯光。我停下手摇车，徒步向城镇走去。我谨慎又犹豫地走进市镇机关。危地马拉的军队我倒不害怕，可是一想到可能要与职业介绍所的人短兵相接，我的心就颤抖。在这个国家很容易雇到帮手并能把他们长期留下。我的确能想象到美国太太和危地马拉太太在某个祥和、寂静的夜晚隔着山丘把一点小八卦传过去。‘啊呀，亲爱的，’美国太太说，‘我的帮工让我很麻烦，夫人。’‘法律，现在需要法律！’危地马拉太太说，‘不至于吧，夫人！我的帮工永远不想离开我——嘻—嘻！夫人，’危地马拉太太窃笑着说。","“So I had to leave Halloran.I dressed quiet, and slipped out of the tent we were in.When the guard came along I knocked him over, like a ninepin, with a green coconut I had, and made for the railroad.I got on that hand-car and made it fly.’Twas yet a while before daybreak when I saw the lights of Port Barrios about a mile away.I stopped the hand-car there and walked to the town.I stepped inside the corporations of that town with care and hesitations.I was not afraid of the army of Guatemala, but me soul quaked at the prospect of a hand-to-hand struggle with its employment bureau.’Tis a country that hires its help easy and keeps ‘em long.Sure I can fancy Missis America and Missis Guatemala passin’ a bit of gossip some fine, still night across the mountains.‘Oh, dear,’ says Missis America, ‘and it’s a lot of trouble I’m havin’ ag’in with the help, senora, ma’am.’‘Laws, now!’ says Missis Guatemala, ‘you don’t say so, ma’am!now, mine never think of leavin me—te-he!ma’am,’ snickers Missis Guatemala."
"“我想知道怎么才能逃离热带而不被人再次雇佣。虽然天黑了，我仍然能看到一艘轮船停泊在港口，烟囱里正冒着烟。我沿着一条通向海边的长满草的小街走下去。在海边我发现了一个矮小的棕色皮肤的黑人驾着小艇正准备离开。","“I was wonderin’ how I was goin’ to move away from them tropics without bein’ hired again.Dark as it was, I could see a steamer ridin’ in the harbor, with smoke emergin’ from her stacks.I turned down a little grass street that run down to the water.On the beach I found a little brown nigger-man just about to shove off in a skiff."
"“‘等一下，黑人，’我说，‘会说英语吗？’","“‘Hold on, Sambo,’ says I, ‘savve English?’"
"“‘是的，会很多。’他愉快地咧着嘴笑着说。","“‘Heap plenty, yes,’ says he, with a pleasant grin."
"“‘那一艘是什么船？’我问他，‘这船要去哪里？另外有什么消息？或者什么好新闻？还有，什么时候了？’","“‘What steamer is that?’I asks him, ‘and where is it going?And what’s the news, and the good word and the time of day?’"
"“‘那艘船叫肯奇塔号，’这个棕色男人一边说着，语气友善平和，一边卷着烟。‘它从新奥尔良来运香蕉的。昨天晚上装好的船。我想一两个钟头后就会开船。明天会有个好天气。你听说有人在谈论打一场大仗吗，或许是这样的吧？你觉得会抓住德维加将军吗，先生？会？不会？’","“‘That steamer the Conchita,’ said the brown man, affable and easy, rollin’ a cigarette.‘Him come from New Orleans for load banana.Him got load last night.I think him sail in one, two hour.Verree nice day we shall be goin’ have.You hear some talkee ‘bout big battle, maybe so?You think catchee General De Vega, senor?Yes?No?’"
"“‘怎么回事，黑人？’我说，‘大仗？打什么仗？谁想抓德维加将军？这几个月我一直呆在内地的金矿，什么消息也没听说。’","“‘How’s that, Sambo?’ says I. ‘Big battle?What battle?Who wants catchee General De Vega?I’ve been up at my old gold mines in the interior for a couple of months, and haven’t heard any news.’"
"“‘哦，’那个黑人很得意地说着英语，‘危地马拉在一星期前闹了一场大革命。德维加将军，他想做总统。他招募了一支——一千——五千——是一万人的军队打政府。政府派了五千——四万——不，是十万士兵去镇压革命。昨天他们在洛马格兰德打了一场大仗——那个地方在山里，大约19或50英里远。政府军队打垮了德维加将军——哎呀，非常惨。他的手下有五百——九百——不，两千人被杀。那革命是场粉碎性的镇压革命——破灭——非常快。德维加将军，他骑一头大骡子快速地跑—跑—跑了。是的，他妈的！将军，他跑—跑—跑了，他的军队被歼灭了。政府军队，他们非常想抓住德维加将军。他们想抓住他毙了。你觉得他们会抓住将军吗，先生？’","“‘Oh,’ says the nigger-man, proud to speak the English, ‘verree great revolution in Guatemala one week ago.General De Vega, him try be president.Him raise armee—one—five—ten thousand mans for fight at the government.Those one government send five—forty—hundred thousand soldier to suppress revolution.They fight big battle yesterday at Lomagrande—that about nineteen or fifty mile in the mountain.That government soldier wheep General De Vega—oh, most bad.Five hundred—nine hundred—two thousand of his mans is kill.That revolution is smash suppress—bust—very quick.General De Vega, him r-r-run away fast on one big mule.Yes, carrambos!The general, him r-r-run away, and his armee is kill.That government soldier, they try find General De Vega verree much.They want catchee him for shoot.You think they catchee that general, senor?’"
"“‘上天注定呀！’我说，‘把克兰西好战的才能用来扛锄头和铁锹去开辟热带，这是天意。但是现在与其说是造反的问题，对我这个小人物而言，不如说是雇佣帮工的问题。我急切地想要辞去负责的位置，而且非常相信你们伟大而堕落的国家的清道夫部门。用你的小船把我送到那艘轮船上吧，我给你五美元——五比索——五比索，’我说，换用热带方言说了钱的面值。","“‘Saints grant it!’ says I. ‘’Twould be the judgment of Providence for settin’ the warlike talent of a Clancy to gradin’ the tropics with a pick and shovel.But ’tis not so much a question of insurrections now, me little man, as ’tis of the hired-man problem.’Tis anxious I am to resign a situation of responsibility and trust with the white wings department of your great and degraded country.Row me in your little boat out to that steamer, and I’ll give ye five dollars—sinker pacers—sinker pacers,’ says I, reducing the offer to the language and denomination of the tropic dialects."
"“‘五比索，’小个子重复道，‘五美元，你给我？’","“‘Cinco pesos,’ repeats the little man.Five dollee, you give?’"
"“那小个子并不坏。起初他有些迟疑，说旅客离开国境时必须有文件和护照，但是最后他还是把我送到轮船边。","“’Twas not such a bad little man.He had hesitations at first, sayin’ that passengers leavin’ the country had to have papers and passports, but at last he took me out alongside the steamer."
"“我们到达船边时，天刚亮，船上一个人影也没有。海面很平静，那个黑人从小船上助我一臂，为了装水果，船的侧面与甲板相平，我从那边爬到船上。舱口是开着的，我望进去，看到里面堆满了香蕉，有六英尺高。我暗自想道：‘克兰西，你最好当个偷渡者走掉。那样更安全些。轮船上的人可能会把你交还给职业介绍所。热带的那些人会抓住你，克兰西，如果你不保持警惕。","“Day was just breakin’ as we struck her, and there wasn’t a soul to be seen on board.The water was very still, and the nigger-man gave me a lift from the boat, and I climbed onto the steamer where her side was sliced to the deck for loadin’ fruit.The hatches was open, and I looked down and saw the cargo of bananas that filled the hold to within six feet of the top.I thinks to myself, ‘Clancy, you better go as a stowaway.It’s safer.The steamer men might hand you back to the employment bureau.The tropic’ll get you, Clancy, if you don’t watch out.’"
"“所以我毫不费力地跳进香蕉堆里，挖了个洞藏在一串串香蕉里。大约一个小时后，我听到引擎发动的声音，感觉到船在摇晃。我知道我们正驶向大海。为了空气流通，他们把舱口开着，一会儿，船舱里就足够明亮了，能看得很清楚。我开始感觉有点饿，想着可以弄个水果午餐，来提提神。我从自己挖的洞里爬出来，站直了。就在那时，我看到大约十英尺远的地方有另一个人爬出来，他伸出手拿香蕉，剥完皮，然后塞进嘴里。那是个很脏的男人，黑黑的面孔，衣衫破烂不堪，一副可耻的样子。是的，那个家伙很像报纸上滑稽栏里那个疲倦的胖威利的画像。我又看了看，发现他是我的将军大人——德维加，雄才大略的革命家，骡子骑手兼进口鹤嘴锄的商人。他看到我时，怔了一下，嘴里塞满了香蕉，眼睛瞪得像椰子一样大。","“So I jumps down easy among the bananas, and digs out a hole to hide in among the bunches.In an hour or so I could hear the engines goin’, and feel the steamer rockin’, and I knew we were off to sea.They left the hatches open for ventilation, and pretty soon it was light enough in the hold to see fairly well.I got to feelin’ a bit hungry, and thought I’d have a light fruit lunch, by way of refreshment.I creeped out of the hole I’d made and stood up straight.Just then I saw another man crawl up about ten feet away and reach out and skin a banana and stuff it into his mouth.’Twas a dirty man, black-faced and ragged and disgraceful of aspect.Yes, the man was a ringer for the pictures of the fat Weary Willie in the funny papers.I looked again, and saw it was my general man—De Vega, the great revolutionist, mule-rider and pickaxe importer.When he saw me the general hesitated with his mouth filled with banana and his eyes the size of coconuts."
"“‘嘘！’我说，‘别说话，不然他们会把我们赶下船，让我们自己走路的。自由万岁！’我又加了一句。为了掩饰感情，我把一只香蕉塞进嘴里。我确信将军不会认出我。热带那恶毒的劳动已经把我变得面目全非。半寸长的红棕色胡须遮住了我的脸，我身上穿着一条蓝色工装裤和一件红色衬衫。","“‘Hist!’I says.‘Not a word, or they’ll put us off and make us walk.“Veev la Liberty!”’ I adds, copperin’ the sentiment by shovin’ a banana into the source of it.I was certain the general wouldn’t recognize me.The nefarious work of the tropics had left me lookin’ different.There was half an inch of roan whiskers coverin’ me face, and me costume was a pair of blue overalls and a red shirt."
"“‘你是怎么上这船的，先生？’将军一能开口说话就问道。","“‘How you come in the ship, senor?’ asked the general as soon as he could speak."
"“‘从后门进来的——嘘！’我说。‘那是我们为了自由进行的光荣斗争，’我继续说，‘但是由于人少我们被打败了。让我们像勇士一样接受我们的失败吧，再来一只香蕉。’","“‘By the back door—whist!’ says I. ‘’Twas a glorious blow for liberty we struck,’ I continues; ‘but we was overpowered by numbers.Let us accept our defeat like brave men and eat another banana.’"
"“‘你也参与了那场为了自由而战的斗争，先生？’将军说，泪水落在船舱的货物上。","“‘Were you in the cause of liberty fightin’, senor?’ says the general, sheddin’ tears on the cargo."
"“‘战斗到最后，’我说，‘是我对暴君的狗腿子们进行了最后一次奋不顾身的冲锋。可是那把他们逼疯了，我们不得不撤退。是我，将军，弄到了你逃跑时骑的那头骡子。你能不能把那串熟香蕉往这边推一下，将军？我有点够不着。谢谢。’","“‘To the last,’ says I. ‘’Twas I led the last desperate charge against the minions of the tyrant.But it made them mad, and we was forced to retreat.’Twas I, general, procured the mule upon which you escaped.Could you give that ripe bunch a little boost this way, general?It’s a bit out of my reach.Thanks.’"
"“‘原来你是这样的，勇敢的爱国志士？’将军说道，又一次流下眼泪。‘啊，天哪！但是我没有办法报答你的忠诚。我差点没捡回自己这条命。他妈的！那头骡子真是个魔鬼，先生！我骑在上面就像坐在暴风雨中的船上似的横冲直撞。我的皮肤都被荆棘蔓藤划破了。该死的畜生冲撞了一百棵树，害苦了我的腿。晚上，我到了巴里奥斯港。我把骡子扔到山下，沿着海边快走。我发现了一只拴在那儿的小船。我上了船，划到了轮船旁边。我见船上没人，就顺着悬挂在船侧的一根绳子爬了上来。然后，把自己藏在香蕉堆里。毫无疑问，我知道，如果船长看到我，他们肯定会再次把我扔给那些危地马拉人。那样可就不好了。危地马拉人将会枪毙德维加将军的。所以，我隐藏起来，一声不响。生命本身是光荣的。自由固然好；但是我认为还是生命更美好。’","“‘Say you so, brave patriot?’ said the general, again weepin’.‘Ah, Dios!And I have not the means to reward your devotion.Barely did I my life bring away.Carrambos!what a devil’s animal was that mule, senor!Like ships in one storm was I dashed about.The skin on myself was ripped away with the thorns and vines.Upon the bark of a hundred trees did that beast of the infernal bump, and cause outrage to the legs of mine.In the night to Port Barrios I came.I dispossess myself of that mountain of mule and hasten along the water shore.I find a little boat to be tied.I launch myself and row to the steamer.I cannot see any mans on board, so I climbed one rope which hang at the side.I then myself hide in the bananas.Surely, I say, if the ship captains view me, they shall throw me again to those Guatemala.Those things are not good.Guatemala will shoot General De Vega.Therefore, I am hide and remain silent.Life itself is glorious.Liberty, it is pretty good; but so good as life I do not think.’"
"“就像我刚才说过的，到新奥尔良有三天的航程。将军和我慢慢成了莫逆之交。我们一直吃香蕉，直到看到就厌烦，尝到就反胃，但是香蕉是唯一能填饱肚子的东西。晚上，我小心翼翼地爬到下层甲板上，弄一桶清水喝。","“Three days, as I said, was the trip to New Orleans.The general man and me got to be cronies of the deepest dye.Bananas we ate until they were distasteful to the sight and an eyesore to the palate, but to bananas alone was the bill of fare reduced.At night I crawls out, careful, on the lower deck, and gets a bucketful of fresh water."
"“那个德维加将军是个话痨。他不说话时旅途会显得更加单调乏味。他以为我是他同党的革命者，他告诉我在这个队伍中有很多美国人和其他外国人。他是个自吹自擂、自以为是、废话连篇的家伙，却自命为英雄。他为自己密谋的失败感到遗憾无比。而对那些被打死的或在革命中奋战到死的的乱来的白痴们，这个自命不凡的家伙却只字不提。","“That General De Vega was a man inhabited by an engorgement of words and sentences.He added to the monotony of the voyage by divestin’ himself of conversation.He believed I was a revolutionist of his own party, there bein’ as he told me, a good many Americans and other foreigners in its ranks.’Twas a braggart and a conceited little gabbler it was, though he considered himself a hero.’Twas on himself he wasted all his regrets at the failing of his plot.Not a word did the little balloon have to say about the other misbehaving idiots that had been shot, or run themselves to death in his revolution."
"“航程的第二天，作为一个躲藏起来的靠一头骡子和偷来的香蕉生存的反叛者，他开始自吹自擂，表现得非常盛气凌人。他向我讲述他负责修建的那条伟大的铁路，还讲述了一件他自认为很滑稽的事情，说他把一个愚蠢的爱尔兰人从新奥尔良诱骗到了他那狭窄铁路轨道上的小陈尸所里扛铁镐。听到这个卑鄙的小个子家伙讲述他把鲁莽愚蠢的克兰西诱骗上手的可耻故事，真叫人难受。而他，哈哈大笑，笑了好一会儿。这个没有朋友、没有国家的黑人反叛者和流亡者，站在齐着脖子深的香蕉堆里笑得前仰后合。","“The second day out he was feelin’ pretty braggy and uppish for a stowed-away conspirator that owed his existence to a mule and stolen bananas.He was tellin’ me about the great railroad he had been buildin’, and he relates what he calls a comic incident about a fool Irishman he inveigled from New Orleans to sling a pick on his little morgue of a narrow-gauge line.’Twas sorrowful to hear the little, dirty general tell the opprobrious story of how he put salt upon the tail of that reckless and silly bird, Clancy.Laugh, he did, hearty and long.He shook with laughin’, the black-faced rebel and outcast, standing neck-deep in bananas, without friends or country."
"“‘啊呀，先生，’他吃吃地笑着说道，‘那个滑稽透顶的爱尔兰人会把你笑死的。我对他说：‘危地马拉非常需要强壮、高大的人。’‘我要为了你深受压迫的国家而斗争。’他说。‘你会那样做的。’我告诉他。啊！一个如此滑稽有趣的爱尔兰人。他在码头上看到一只破损的箱子，里面装着警卫用的几支枪。他以为所有的箱子里都装着枪。其实都是铁镐。是的。哎！先生，要是你能看到他们叫他去干活时那个爱尔兰人的表情就好了！’","“‘Ah, senor,’ he snickers, ‘to death you would have laughed at that drollest Irish.I say to him: ‘Strong, big mans is need very much in Guatemala.’‘I will blows strike for your down-pressed country,’ he say.‘That shall you do,’ I tell him.Ah! it was an Irish so comic.He sees one box break upon the wharf that contain for the guard a few gun.He think there is gun in all the box.But that is all pickaxe.Yes.Ah! senor, could you the face of that Irish have seen when they set him to the work!’"
"“就这样，这位职业介绍所的前任老板用作乐的笑话和轶事使旅途更加单调乏味。但是他偶尔会在香蕉堆里哭诉逝去的自由事业和那头骡子。","“’Twas thus the ex-boss of the employment bureau contributed to the tedium of the trip with merry jests and anecdote.But now and then he would weep upon the bananas and make oration about the lost cause of liberty and the mule."
"“听到轮船碰到新奥尔良码头的声音，真是令人愉快。不一会儿，我们听到了很多人光着脚走路发出的啪啪声。那帮卸水果的外国佬跳上甲板，进入货舱。我和将军忙着递了一会儿香蕉，他们以为我们也是那帮干活的人。大约一个小时后，我们成功地溜下轮船到了码头。","“’Twas a pleasant sound when the steamer bumped against the pier in New Orleans.Pretty soon we heard the pat-a-pat of hundreds of bare feet, and the Dago gang that unloads the fruit jumped on the deck and down into the hold.Me and the general worked a while at passing up the bunches, and they thought we were part of the gang.After about an hour we managed to slip off the steamer onto the wharf."
"“这真是莫大的荣幸，这位伟大的国外反叛势力的代表能在名不见经传的克兰西的手里得到款待。我先为将军和自己买了些大杯饮料和一些不是香蕉的吃的东西。那位将军快步跟在我的旁边，一切听我安排。我领他到拉斐特广场，让他坐在小公园的一张长凳上。我给他买了烟，他就像一个矮小肥胖又心满意足的流浪汉一样弓着背坐在凳子上。我看着他坐在那儿，他的样子使我很高兴。他天生的棕色皮肤上现在满是污垢和灰尘。因为那头骡子，他的衣服被扯成一条一挂，破烂不堪。是的，将军的样子很合克兰西的心意。","“’Twas a great honor on the hands of an obscure Clancy, havin’ the entertainment of the representative of a great foreign filibustering power.I first bought for the general and myself many long drinks and things to eat that were not bananas.The general man trotted along at my side, leaving all the arrangements to me.I led him up to Lafayette Square and set him on a bench in the little park.Cigarettes I had bought for him, and he humped himself down on the seat like a little, fat, contented hobo.I look him over as he sets there, and what I see pleases me.Brown by nature and instinct, he is now brindled with dirt and dust.Praise to the mule, his clothes is mostly strings and flaps.Yes, the looks of the general man is agreeable to Clancy."
"“我旁敲侧击地问他，是否碰巧从危地马拉带来了别人的钱。他叹息一声，弓起肩靠在长凳上。一分也没有。没关系。他告诉我，也行他热带的那几个朋友随后会向他寄些经费。将军已像我曾经看到的空箱子一样无计可施了。","“I asks him, delicate, if, by any chance, he brought away anybody’s money with him from Guatemala.He sighs and humps his shoulders against the bench.Not a cent.All right.Maybe, he tells me, some of his friends in the tropic outfit will send him funds later.The general was as clear a case of no visible means as I ever saw."
"“我叫他不要离开长凳，然后我前往波伊德拉斯和卡龙德莱特地区。那一带是奥哈拉的管辖区。五分钟后，奥哈拉过来了，他是一个高大、健康的人，红红的脸膛，衣扣雪亮，手里挥舞着他的警棍。进入奥哈拉的管辖区对于危地马拉人是件好事。如果一周内有一两次机会用警棍镇压一下革命和起义，对丹尼来说是一种很好的娱乐消遣。","“I told him not to move from the bench, and then I went up to the corner of Poydras and Carondelet.Along there is O’Hara’s beat.In five minutes along comes O’Hara, a big, fine man, red-faced, with shinin’ buttons, swinging his club.’Twould be a fine thing for Guatemala to move into O’Hara’s precinct.’Twould be a fine bit of recreation for Danny to suppress revolutions and uprisins once or twice a week with his club."
"“‘5046还有效吗，丹尼？’我边说边朝他走过去。","“‘Is 5046 workin’ yet, Danny?’ says I, walking up to him."
"”‘延时了，’奥哈拉说道，怀疑地打量着我，‘想干什么？’","“‘Overtime,’ says O’Hara, looking over me suspicious.‘Want some of it?’"
"“五零四六是条著名的城市法令，它批准逮捕、定罪和监禁那些向警察成功地隐瞒罪行的人。”","“Fifty-forty-six is the celebrated city ordinance authorizing arrest, conviction and imprisonment of persons that succeed in concealing their crimes from the police."
"“‘你难道不认识吉米·克兰西了？’我说，‘你这个红脸家伙。’所以，当奥哈拉从我那拜热带所赐的肮脏面孔下认出我来时，我把他推到门口，并告诉他我要做什么及为什么。‘好吧，吉米，’奥哈拉说，‘回去看着那个长凳。我十分钟后过去。’","“‘Don’t ye know Jimmy Clancy?’ says I. ‘Ye pink-gilled monster.’So, when O’Hara recognized me beneath the scandalous exterior bestowed upon me by the tropics, I backed him into a doorway and told him what I wanted, and why I wanted it.‘All right, Jimmy,’ says O’Hara.‘Go back and hold the bench.I’ll be along in ten minutes.’"
"“十分钟后，奥哈拉悠闲地走过拉斐特广场，发现两个讨厌的家伙毫无尊严地呆在一条长凳上。又过了十分钟，詹·克兰西和德维加将军，前危地马拉总统候选人，到了警察局。将军吓得要死，叫我说说他那高贵的身份和地位。","“In that time O’Hara strolled through Lafayette Square and spied two Weary Willies disgracin’ one of the benches.In ten minutes more J. Clancy and General De Vega, late candidate for the presidency of Guatemala, was in the station house.The general is badly frightened, and calls upon me to proclaim his distinguishments and rank."
"“‘这个人，’我对警察说，‘以前是个铁路工人。他现在过着流浪的生活。由于丢掉了工作，他有点神经。","“‘The man,’ says I to the police, ‘used to be a railroad man.He’s on the bum now.’Tis a little bughouse he is, on account of losin’ his job.’"
"“‘他妈的！’将军说，气得声音就像小瓶苏打喷水喷出的嘶嘶声，‘先生，你曾在我的军队在我的国家作战。为什么要说那些谎话？你应该说我是德维加将军，一名军人，一位西班牙绅士——’","“‘Carrambos!’ says the general, fizzin’ like a little soda-fountain, ‘you fought, senor, with my forces in my native country.Why do you say the lies?You shall say I am the General De Vega, one soldier, one caballero—’"
"“‘修铁路的，’我又说道，‘破产了。毫无用处。靠偷来的香蕉活了三天。看他那副嘴脸。那样还不够吗？’","“‘Railroader,’ says I again.‘On the hog.No good.Been livin’ for three days on stolen bananas.Look at him.Ain’t that enough?’"
"“罚款25美元或囚禁60天，这是警察记录人员给将军的处罚。他一分钱都没有，所以只好坐牢。他们让我走了，我知道他们会这样做的，因为我拿得出钱，而且奥哈拉会为我说好话。是的；他得到了监禁60天的惩罚。这刚好和我替那个伟大的国家，堪——不，危地马拉，扛铁锹干活的时间一样长。","“Twenty-five dollars or sixty days, was what the recorder gave the general.He didn’t have a cent, so he took the time.They let me go, as I knew they would, for I had money to show, and O’Hara spoke for me.Yes; sixty days he got.’Twas just so long as I slung a pick for the great country of Kam—Guatemala.”"
"克兰西停了下来。明亮的星光洒在他经历过风雨的脸上，他显露出幸福而满足的神情。基奥从他的椅子上侧过身来，拍了一下他的同伴衣着单薄的后背，听着像海浪击打沙滩一样。","Clancy paused.The bright starlight showed a reminiscent look of happy content on his seasoned features.Keogh leaned in his chair and gave his partner a slap on his thinly clad back that sounded like the crack of the surf on the sands."
"“给我们说说，你这个坏蛋，”他窃笑着说，“你是用什么样的花招跟那个热带将军算账的。”","“Tell ‘em, ye divil,” he chuckled, “how you got even with the tropical general in the way of agricultural maneuverings.”"
"“‘他没有钱，’克兰西饶有兴趣地总结道，‘他们就派他干活来抵偿罚款，跟教区监狱的一帮囚犯一块打扫乌尔苏拉大街。在拐角处有一个公共大厅，里面装饰宜人，有电扇和消暑物品。我把那儿当作自己的总部，每隔十五分钟，我就过去转转，看一下那个小个子，看他用一把耙子和铁铲干活。有一天就像今天这样炎热潮湿。我朝他喊道：‘喂，先生！’他横眉怒目地瞪着我，汗水几乎弄湿了他的整个衬衫。","“‘Having no money,’ concluded Clancy, with unction, “they set him to work his fine out with a gang from the parish prison clearing Ursulines Street.Around the corner was a saloon decorated genially with electric fans and cool merchandise.I made that me headquarters, and every fifteen minutes I’d walk around and take a look at the little man filibusterin’ with a rake and shovel.’Twas just such a hot broth of a day as this has been.And I’d call at him ‘Hey, monseer!’ and he’d look at me black, with the damp showin’ through his shirt in places."
"“‘肥胖、强壮的人，’我对德维加将军说，‘是新奥尔良所需要的。’是的。美好的事业得有人干下去。他妈的！爱尔兰永存！’”","“‘Fat, strong mans,’ says I to General De Vega, ‘is needed in New Orleans.Yes.To carry on the good work.Carrambos!Erin go bragh!’”"
