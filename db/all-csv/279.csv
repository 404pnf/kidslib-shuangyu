"胎痣","The Birthmark"
"作者：纳撒尼尔·霍桑","by Nathaniel Hawthorne"
"上世纪后半叶，有一位科学家，在自然哲学的每个分支领域都声名显赫。在讲述下面的故事之前，首先要说的是，他让人感受到的内在亲和力，胜似任何一种化学药品的药效。他把实验室交给助手看管，擦掉那俊朗面容上的炉烟，洗去手指酸液的痕迹，并说服一位美人成为自己的妻子。那时，人类刚刚探索出了电领域的自然奥秘，这似乎开辟了一条通往奇迹的道路。因此，当一个人对科学满腔热忱，而对女人又充满爱意时，这二者通常会在程度和吸引力上进行较量。只有不断地追求目标，才可能维持高于常人的智力、想象力、斗志、甚至毅力，一些狂热于目标的哲人认为，沿着智慧的阶梯不断提高人生追求，才能捕捉到创造力的奥秘，才能创造出属于自己的新天地。我们不知道艾尔默是否怀有足够的信心，相信人类最终能够战胜自然。然而，他毫无保留地致力于科学研究，从未有其他任何事情使他如此激情四溢、坚定不移。在这两种爱当中，他对妻子的爱更为强烈；然而，只有当他对妻子的爱意与对科学的热忱交织在一起，当追求科学的动力与他自身的精神力量融为一体时，才会这样。","In the latter part of the last century there lived a man of science, an eminent proficient in every branch of natural philosophy, who not long before our story opens had made experience of a spiritual affinity more attractive than any chemical one.He had left his laboratory to the care of an assistant, cleared his fine countenance from the furnace smoke, washed the stain of acids from his fingers, and persuaded a beautiful woman to become his wife.In those days when the comparatively recent discovery of electricity and other kindred mysteries of Nature seemed to open paths into the region of miracle, it was not unusual for the love of science to rival the love of woman in its depth and absorbing energy.The higher intellect, the imagination, the spirit, and even the heart might all find their congenial aliment in pursuits which, as some of their ardent votaries believed, would ascend from one step of powerful intelligence to another, until the philosopher should lay his hand on the secret of creative force and perhaps make new worlds for himself.We know not whether Aylmer possessed this degree of faith in man’s ultimate control over Nature.He had devoted himself, however, too unreservedly to scientific studies ever to be weaned from them by any second passion.His love for his young wife might prove the stronger of the two; but it could only be by intertwining itself with his love of science, and uniting the strength of the latter to his own."
"于是这些结合产生了，并且其结果令人深思，其教训十分深刻。他们婚后不久的一天，艾尔默一边坐着，一边盯着妻子看，越看越苦恼，最终他开口了。","Such a union accordingly took place, and was attended with truly remarkable consequences and a deeply impressive moral.One day, very soon after their marriage, Aylmer sat gazing at his wife with a trouble in his countenance that grew stronger until he spoke."
"“乔治亚娜，”他问，“你从没想过把脸上的那颗痣给祛掉吗？”","“Georgiana,” said he, “has it never occurred to you that the mark upon your cheek might be removed?”"
"“没，还真没有。”乔治亚娜微笑着说；但是，察觉到丈夫并非开玩笑后，她羞得满脸通红，“老实跟你说，别人经常说这是种魅力，所以我也没多想，觉得可能是这样吧。”","“No, indeed,” said she, smiling; but perceiving the seriousness of his manner, she blushed deeply.“To tell you the truth it has been so often called a charm that I was simple enough to imagine it might be so.”"
"“哦，在别人脸上或许是吧，”她丈夫回答道，“可在你脸上绝对不是。不，亲爱的乔治亚娜，大自然把你造得几近完美，因此这个最微不足道的瑕疵——我们下不了定论说它是瑕疵还是美人痣——但这颗痣让我感到震惊，因为它是人间缺陷的印记。”","“Ah, upon another face perhaps it might,” replied her husband; “but never on yours.No, dearest Georgiana, you came so nearly perfect from the hand of Nature that this slightest possible defect, which we hesitate whether to term a defect or a beauty, shocks me, as being the visible mark of earthly imperfection.”"
"“居然让你震惊了，我的夫君啊！”乔治亚娜叫道，她感觉自己十分受伤；起初是由于那一瞬间的愤怒而满脸通红，紧接着突然哭了起来，“那你为什么要从我母亲身边将我带走？你不可能爱上让你震惊的东西！”","“Shocks you, my husband!” cried Georgiana, deeply hurt; at first reddening with momentary anger, but then bursting into tears.“Then why did you take me from my mother’s side?You cannot love what shocks you!”"
"要把这段对话解释清楚，首先必须说明一件事——乔治亚娜左脸正中有一颗独特的痣，深深地嵌入面部肌肉组织里。通常情况下，她脸庞娇嫩，健康红润——这颗痣略显深红，在周围的玫瑰红的映衬下，形状不是很清晰。乔治亚娜突然脸红的时候，这颗痣就会渐渐模糊，随着血液上涌，红晕泛起，这颗痣便几乎看不到了。但若她情绪变化，脸色苍白，这颗痣又会出现，犹如白雪之中一点红，十分明显，有时几乎让艾尔默觉得可怕。这颗痣的形状很像人的手，尽管只有最小个儿侏儒的手那么大。乔治亚娜的追求者们总是说，在她出生的时候，某位仙女将自己的小手按在她这个婴儿的脸颊上，把这个印记留在那里，象征一种奇妙的恩赐，赋予她倾倒众生的魅力。许多疯狂的求爱者为了得到亲吻这神秘玉手的特权，不惜以生命为代价。然而，无须讳言，由于人们性情各异，这位仙女的手印留给人的印象便迥异万千。某些吹毛求疵的人——无一例外都是女性——断言那只血手——她们有意这样称呼——严重破坏了乔治亚娜的美貌，把她变得面目可憎。但是，只需最纯净的大理石上的一小块蓝色斑痕，就能将出自鲍威斯之手的夏娃变成一个怪物，这似乎也不无道理。而男性关注者呢，如果这个胎记不能让他们艳羡十足，就期望它消失，以获得心理满足感。这样，这个世上便可存有一个美轮美奂、毫无瑕疵的活标本。艾尔默婚后便发现自己遇到了这种情况——因为他以前很少去想这个问题，甚至根本不想。","To explain this conversation it must be mentioned that in the centre of Georgiana’s left cheek there was a singular mark, deeply interwoven, as it were, with the texture and substance of her face.In the usual state of her complexion—a healthy though delicate bloom—the mark wore a tint of deeper crimson, which imperfectly defined its shape amid the surrounding rosiness.When she blushed it gradually became more indistinct, and finally vanished amid the triumphant rush of blood that bathed the whole cheek with its brilliant glow.But if any shifting motion caused her to turn pale there was the mark again, a crimson stain upon the snow, in what Aylmer sometimes deemed an almost fearful distinctness.Its shape bore not a little similarity to the human hand, though of the smallest pygmy size.Georgiana’s lovers were wont to say that some fairy at her birth hour had laid her tiny hand upon the infant’s cheek, and left this impress there in token of the magic endowments that were to give her such sway over all hearts.Many a desperate swain would have risked life for the privilege of pressing his lips to the mysterious hand.It must not be concealed, however, that the impression wrought by this fairy sign manual varied exceedingly, according to the difference of temperament in the beholders.Some fastidious persons—but they were exclusively of her own sex—affirmed that the bloody hand, as they chose to call it, quite destroyed the effect of Georgiana’s beauty, and rendered her countenance even hideous.But it would be as reasonable to say that one of those small blue stains which sometimes occur in the purest statuary marble would convert the Eve of Powers to a monster.Masculine observers, if the birthmark did not heighten their admiration, contented themselves with wishing it away, that the world might possess one living specimen of ideal loveliness without the semblance of a flaw.After his marriage,—for he thought little or nothing of the matter before,—Aylmer discovered that this was the case with himself."
"如果她没有那么漂亮——如果嫉妒女神能找到其他人来嘲笑的话，那他也许觉得自己会因这小巧可人的手印而情感升温，这手印时而轮廓模糊，时而消失不见，时而悄然出现，随着她内心情感的波动若隐若现；可是她却如此完美，因此他们一起生活得越久，他就越无法容忍这瑕疵。这是人类一大致命的瑕疵，自然之神以种种形式给她的造物留下不可磨灭的印记，或意味着生命短暂而有限，或意味着追求完美则必将经受苦痛。而这深红色的手印表明，人类无法挣脱命运的束缚，死亡紧紧抓住人世间最高贵最纯洁的造物，把他们贬低到最卑贱的地位、甚至与畜生同列。他们的形体也会如畜生一样回归尘土。因此，从这个角度出发，艾尔默就把这个胎记看作是妻子难逃罪孽、悲痛、堕落和死亡的象征。不久，他悲观地把胎记想象成可怕之物，这给他带来的苦恼与恐惧，远超过乔治亚娜的美貌与善心带来的快乐。","Had she been less beautiful,—if Envy’s self could have found aught else to sneer at,—he might have felt his affection heightened by the prettiness of this mimic hand, now vaguely portrayed, now lost, now stealing forth again and glimmering to and fro with every pulse of emotion that throbbed within her heart; but seeing her otherwise so perfect, he found this one defect grow more and more intolerable with every moment of their united lives.It was the fatal flaw of humanity which Nature, in one shape or another, stamps ineffaceably on all her productions, either to imply that they are temporary and finite, or that their perfection must be wrought by toil and pain.The crimson hand expressed the ineludible gripe in which mortality clutches the highest and purest of earthly mould, degrading them into kindred with the lowest, and even with the very brutes, like whom their visible frames return to dust.In this manner, selecting it as the symbol of his wife’s liability to sin, sorrow, decay, and death, Aylmer’s sombre imagination was not long in rendering the birthmark a frightful object, causing him more trouble and horror than ever Georgiana’s beauty, whether of soul or sense, had given him delight."
"在本该是他们最幸福的日子里，他总会回到这个灾难性的话题上来。这并非他的本意，甚至他还尽量回避这个话题。起先，这个话题不值一提，然而它却引发了一连串不同想法与情感，并与其紧密相连，于是就变成了所有事情的焦点。在清晨曙光里，艾尔默睁开双眼，注视着妻子的脸颊，一下子就认出了这个残缺的标记；晚上，他们一起坐在炉火旁，艾尔默的目光又悄悄游离在她的脸上，在摇曳的火光中，那幽灵般的手忽隐忽现，在他本可以欣然爱慕的地方写下死亡的印记。很快，乔治亚娜就意识到了这一点，每当丈夫凝视时，她就不由得浑身发抖。只需瞥一眼艾尔默脸上那特有的怪异表情，乔治亚娜红润的脸颊霎时就会变得死一般的惨白。脸上的那只深红色手印也会越发明显，恰似洁白大理石上的红宝石浅浮雕。","At all the seasons which should have been their happiest, he invariably and without intending it, nay, in spite of a purpose to the contrary, reverted to this one disastrous topic.Trifling as it at first appeared, it so connected itself with innumerable trains of thought and modes of feeling that it became the central point of all.With the morning twilight Aylmer opened his eyes upon his wife’s face and recognized the symbol of imperfection; and when they sat together at the evening hearth his eyes wandered stealthily to her cheek, and beheld, flickering with the blaze of the wood fire, the spectral hand that wrote mortality where he would fain have worshipped.Georgiana soon learned to shudder at his gaze.It needed but a glance with the peculiar expression that his face often wore to change the roses of her cheek into a deathlike paleness, amid which the crimson hand was brought strongly out, like a bass-relief of ruby on the whitest marble."
"一天深夜，炉火逐渐变暗，那位可怜的妻子脸颊上的瑕疵几乎看不出来；而她自己却首次主动提起这个话题。","Late one night when the lights were growing dim, so as hardly to betray the stain on the poor wife’s cheek, she herself, for the first time, voluntarily took up the subject."
"“我亲爱的艾尔默，你记不记得，”她勉强挤出一丝笑容说，“你昨天晚上做了一个梦，与这只可恶的手有关？”","“Do you remember, my dear Aylmer,” said she, with a feeble attempt at a smile, “have you any recollection of a dream last night about this odious hand?”"
"“没有！什么梦也没有做！”艾尔默惊异地回答道；但接着他又干巴巴冷冰冰地补充了句，好掩饰他内心深处的真实感受，“我可能梦见了吧；因为睡着之前这只小手着实让我遐想了一番。”","“None! none whatever!” replied Aylmer, starting; but then he added, in a dry, cold tone, affected for the sake of concealing the real depth of his emotion, “I might well dream of it; for before I fell asleep it had taken a pretty firm hold of my fancy.”"
"“那你梦见这只手了？”乔治亚娜接着急切地问道；惟恐泪水夺眶而出，打断自己不得不说的话，“一个可怕的梦！我不信你会忘记这个梦。但是可能忘记这句话吗？——‘它已经长到她心里了；我们必须要把它挖出来！’回忆一下，我的夫君；因为无论如何我都要让你回忆起那个梦。”","“And you did dream of it?” continued Georgiana, hastily; for she dreaded lest a gush of tears should interrupt what she had to say.“A terrible dream!I wonder that you can forget it.Is it possible to forget this one expression?—‘It is in her heart now; we must have it out!’Reflect, my husband; for by all means I would have you recall that dream.”"
"当无所不及的睡梦之神无法将她的精灵们禁锢在她那阴暗的势力范围内时，反而任由他们迸发出来，用内心深处的秘密来恐吓现实生活，这种心境真是太悲凉了。这时艾尔默记起了自己的梦。在梦中，艾尔默想象自己与助手阿米纳达布一道，试图通过手术来祛除那颗胎痣；但是刀进得越深，那只手就陷得越深，直到最后，这只小手紧紧抓住了乔治亚娜的心脏；然而，艾尔默却下定决心非要切除这颗胎痣。","The mind is in a sad state when Sleep, the all-involving, cannot confine her spectres within the dim region of her sway, but suffers them to break forth, affrighting this actual life with secrets that perchance belong to a deeper one.Aylmer now remembered his dream.He had fancied himself with his servant Aminadab, attempting an operation for the removal of the birthmark; but the deeper went the knife, the deeper sank the hand, until at length its tiny grasp appeared to have caught hold of Georgiana’s heart; whence, however, her husband was inexorably resolved to cut or wrench it away."
"当艾尔默清晰地记起这个梦时，他坐在妻子面前，心里十分内疚。通常，当脑袋被包裹在睡袍中时，真相就会出现，然后直言相陈我们在清醒时无意识的自我欺骗行为。直到现在，艾尔默才意识到自己已为另一个想法所左右，而为了得到内心的安宁，他会采取一定的行动。","When the dream had shaped itself perfectly in his memory, Aylmer sat in his wife’s presence with a guilty feeling.Truth often finds its way to the mind close muffled in robes of sleep, and then speaks with uncompromising directness of matters in regard to which we practise an unconscious self-deception during our waking moments.Until now he had not been aware of the tyrannizing influence acquired by one idea over his mind, and of the lengths which he might find in his heart to go for the sake of giving himself peace."
"“艾尔默，”乔治亚娜接着严肃地说，“我不知道祛除这颗要命的胎痣，咱俩得付出怎样的代价。或许祛除这颗痣会落下无法医治的残疾；或者这个瑕疵就是生命深刻的印记。我再问一遍：不惜一切代价，有没有可能摆脱这在我出生前就将我紧紧束缚的小手呢？”","“Aylmer,” resumed Georgiana, solemnly, “I know not what may be the cost to both of us to rid me of this fatal birthmark.Perhaps its removal may cause cureless deformity; or it may be the stain goes as deep as life itself.Again: do we know that there is a possibility, on any terms, of unclasping the firm gripe of this little hand which was laid upon me before I came into the world?”"
"“最亲爱的乔治亚娜，这个问题我已经考虑很久了，”艾尔默急切地打断她，“我相信祛除这颗痣是绝对可行的。”","“Dearest Georgiana, I have spent much thought upon the subject,” hastily interrupted Aylmer.“I am convinced of the perfect practicability of its removal.”"
"“哪怕只有一点点可能性，”乔治亚娜继续说，“无论冒怎样的风险，我们都要试试。危险对我来说不算什么；因为，当这个可恨的标记使我成为你恐惧和厌恶的对象时——生命就是一个负担，我只想心甘情愿地摆脱它。要么去掉这只可怕的手，要么就拿走我这可怜的生命！你知识渊博。世间有目共睹。你创造过那么多伟大的奇迹。我两只小手指尖就能把这颗小小的胎痣盖住，难道你就祛不掉它吗？为了你自己的安宁，为了拯救你可怜的妻子，好不让她发疯，这难道不是你力所能及的吗？”","“If there be the remotest possibility of it,” continued Georgiana, “let the attempt be made at whatever risk.Danger is nothing to me; for life, while this hateful mark makes me the object of your horror and disgust,—life is a burden which I would fling down with joy.Either remove this dreadful hand, or take my wretched life!You have deep science.All the world bears witness of it.You have achieved great wonders.Cannot you remove this little, little mark, which I cover with the tips of two small fingers?Is this beyond your power, for the sake of your own peace, and to save your poor wife from madness?”"
"“我最高贵、最亲爱、最温柔的妻子啊，”艾尔默狂喜地叫道，“不要怀疑我的能力。我已深入思考过此事——它让我深受启发，几乎能造出一个比你稍欠完美的人来。乔治亚娜，你带领我进一步踏入科学的中心地带。我觉得自己完全有能力使这一侧的面颊同另一侧一样完美无瑕；而且，我最亲爱的，如果我能修复大自然最美丽的杰作，那我将取得怎样的胜利啊！即使皮格马利翁手下的女雕像拥有了生命，他也不会像我这样狂喜。”","“Noblest, dearest, tenderest wife,” cried Aylmer, rapturously, “doubt not my power.I have already given this matter the deepest thought—thought which might almost have enlightened me to create a being less perfect than yourself.Georgiana, you have led me deeper than ever into the heart of science.I feel myself fully competent to render this dear cheek as faultless as its fellow; and then, most beloved, what will be my triumph when I shall have corrected what Nature left imperfect in her fairest work!Even Pygmalion, when his sculptured woman assumed life, felt not greater ecstasy than mine will be.”"
"“那就这么决定了，”乔治亚娜说，淡淡地笑道，“还有，艾尔默，即使你发现这颗胎痣最终躲进我的心脏，也不要对我手下留情。”","“It is resolved, then,” said Georgiana, faintly smiling.“And, Aylmer, spare me not, though you should find the birthmark take refuge in my heart at last.”"
"丈夫温柔地亲了亲她的脸颊——当然是她的右脸——不是那个有深红色手印的半边脸。","Her husband tenderly kissed her cheek—her right cheek—not that which bore the impress of the crimson hand."
"第二天，艾尔默向妻子通报了拟好的方案，这样他就有机会深思熟虑，专心观察，这是做手术必需的；而乔治亚娜也可以安心静养，这对手术成功至关重要。他们要与外界隔离，住进艾尔默用作实验室的大房子里去；艾尔默年轻时在那里奋力劳作，发现了大自然的原动力，受到了整个欧洲学术界的钦佩与赞扬。这位面色苍白的哲学家曾静坐于实验室里，探索出了最高云层与最深矿藏的奥秘；为查明了火山爆发与不断喷火的原因而心满意足；他还解开了泉水的奥秘，解释了为何从黑暗的地心喷涌而出的泉水，有的清澈甘醇，有的则富有医疗功效。更早的时候，他还在这里研究了人体结构的奥秘，试图彻底了解大自然怎样从大地和天空中、从精神世界中吸取她所有宝贵的力量，来创造和培育它的杰作——人类。然而，这项研究已被艾尔默搁置已久，因为他很不情愿承认一个事实——如果否认这个事实，所有探索者迟早都会栽跟头——那就是，我们伟大而富于创造的自然母亲，表面上在光天化日下创造奇迹，这让我们感到愉悦，但又严守自己的奥秘，尽管她装得十分坦诚，可展示给我们的只有结果而无过程。确实，她允许我们进行破坏，却极少允许我们去修补，就像一个心怀妒忌的专利者，绝不允许我们进行创造。然而，现在艾尔默重新开始这几乎已被遗忘的研究；当然并不抱当初的希望或愿望；因为这些研究涉及到许多生理学的真理，并且妨碍了他原先为乔治亚娜拟定的治疗方案。","The next day Aylmer apprised his wife of a plan that he had formed whereby he might have opportunity for the intense thought and constant watchfulness which the proposed operation would require; while Georgiana, likewise, would enjoy the perfect repose essential to its success.They were to seclude themselves in the extensive apartments occupied by Aylmer as a laboratory, and where, during his toilsome youth, he had made discoveries in the elemental powers of Nature that had roused the admiration of all the learned societies in Europe.Seated calmly in this laboratory, the pale philosopher had investigated the secrets of the highest cloud region and of the profoundest mines; he had satisfied himself of the causes that kindled and kept alive the fires of the volcano; and had explained the mystery of fountains, and how it is that they gush forth, some so bright and pure, and others with such rich medicinal virtues, from the dark bosom of the earth.Here, too, at an earlier period, he had studied the wonders of the human frame, and attempted to fathom the very process by which Nature assimilates all her precious influences from earth and air, and from the spiritual world, to create and foster man, her masterpiece.The latter pursuit, however, Aylmer had long laid aside in unwilling recognition of the truth—against which all seekers sooner or later stumble—that our great creative Mother, while she amuses us with apparently working in the broadest sunshine, is yet severely careful to keep her own secrets, and, in spite of her pretended openness, shows us nothing but results.She permits us, indeed, to mar, but seldom to mend, and, like a jealous patentee, on no account to make.Now, however, Aylmer resumed these half-forgotten investigations; not, of course, with such hopes or wishes as first suggested them; but because they involved much physiological truth and lay in the path of his proposed scheme for the treatment of Georgiana."
"当他领着乔治亚娜跨过实验室的门槛时，乔治亚娜不禁发冷，浑身发抖。艾尔默兴高采烈地看着妻子的面庞，本想宽慰宽慰她，但却吃惊地看到妻子白皙的脸颊上，那块胎痣赫然在目，这让他不由地剧烈抽搐了一下。他的妻子晕厥了过去。","As he led her over the threshold of the laboratory, Georgiana was cold and tremulous.Aylmer looked cheerfully into her face, with intent to reassure her, but was so startled with the intense glow of the birthmark upon the whiteness of her cheek that he could not restrain a strong convulsive shudder.His wife fainted."
"“阿米纳达布！阿米纳达布！”艾尔默大叫道，用力乱跺着双脚。","“Aminadab!Aminadab!” shouted Aylmer, stamping violently on the floor."
"从里屋立即蹿出来一个矮个子，身形笨重，满头的乱发遮着他的脸，因熔炉的烟熏火燎而面色灰暗。在艾尔默的整个科学生涯中，这个人一直是他的得力助手，他技能娴熟，非常称职。虽对科学原理一窍不通，却也能够完成主人各项实验中的具体工作。他力大无比，头发蓬乱，满面烟尘，浑身透着难以名状的质朴气息，外表一如其他凡夫俗子；而艾尔默身材修长、肤色白皙、一脸智慧，是人类精神素质的最佳典型。","Forthwith there issued from an inner apartment a man of low stature, but bulky frame, with shaggy hair hanging about his visage, which was grimed with the vapors of the furnace.This personage had been Aylmer’s underworker during his whole scientific career, and was admirably fitted for that office by his great mechanical readiness, and the skill with which, while incapable of comprehending a single principle, he executed all the details of his master’s experiments.With his vast strength, his shaggy hair, his smoky aspect, and the indescribable earthiness that incrusted him, he seemed to represent man’s physical nature; while Aylmer’s slender figure, and pale, intellectual face, were no less apt a type of the spiritual element."
"“把化妆室的门打开，阿米纳达布，”艾尔默说，“再烧一个香锭。”","“Throw open the door of the boudoir, Aminadab,” said Aylmer, “and burn a pastil.”"
"“是，主人，”阿米纳达布关切地看了眼无精打采的乔治亚娜，然后喃喃自语道，“如果她是我的妻子，我是绝对不会把那颗胎痣祛掉的。”","“Yes, master,” answered Aminadab, looking intently at the lifeless form of Georgiana; and then he muttered to himself, “If she were my wife, I’d never part with that birthmark.”"
"乔治亚娜恢复意识后，觉得一阵芳香扑鼻，那温和的效力把她从死一般的晕厥中唤醒。周围是一片魔幻般的景象。艾尔默早把那些烟雾弥漫、肮脏昏暗的屋子改成了一套漂亮的房间，给一个可爱的女士作隐居之所十分合适，他那些探求奥秘的光辉岁月便在那儿度过。墙壁上挂着华丽的窗帘，集庄严和优雅于一体，任何其他的装饰都无法达到这种效果；窗帘从屋顶直落地面，布满褶皱，显得十分厚重，挡住了所有的棱角和线条，似乎把这里与无限的空间隔开。乔治亚娜觉得，这兴许是空中楼阁呢。艾尔默遮挡住了阳光，因为这可能会影响他做化学实验，给屋里点上了散发香味的灯盏，跳动着五颜六色的火焰，融合成一道柔和的紫色光芒。这时，他跪在妻子身边，热切地注视着她，却毫不惊恐；因为他对自己的科学实验有信心，相信自己可以在妻子身边划一个妖孽难入的魔圈。","When Georgiana recovered consciousness she found herself breathing an atmosphere of penetrating fragrance, the gentle potency of which had recalled her from her deathlike faintness.The scene around her looked like enchantment.Aylmer had converted those smoky, dingy, sombre rooms, where he had spent his brightest years in recondite pursuits, into a series of beautiful apartments not unfit to be the secluded abode of a lovely woman.The walls were hung with gorgeous curtains, which imparted the combination of grandeur and grace that no other species of adornment can achieve; and as they fell from the ceiling to the floor, their rich and ponderous folds, concealing all angles and straight lines, appeared to shut in the scene from infinite space.For aught Georgiana knew, it might be a pavilion among the clouds.And Aylmer, excluding the sunshine, which would have interfered with his chemical processes, had supplied its place with perfumed lamps, emitting flames of various hue, but all uniting in a soft, impurpled radiance.He now knelt by his wife’s side, watching her earnestly, but without alarm; for he was confident in his science, and felt that he could draw a magic circle round her within which no evil might intrude."
"“我在哪儿？啊，我想起来了，”乔治亚娜无力地说；她把手按在脸颊上，想遮住那个可怕的痣，不让丈夫看到。","“Where am I?Ah, I remember,” said Georgiana, faintly; and she placed her hand over her cheek to hide the terrible mark from her husband’s eyes."
"“别害怕，亲爱的！”他大叫，“别躲着我！相信我，乔治亚娜，我甚至为这个瑕疵感到高兴，因为能祛掉它真是让我欣喜若狂。”","“Fear not, dearest!” exclaimed he.“Do not shrink from me!Believe me, Georgiana, I even rejoice in this single imperfection, since it will be such a rapture to remove it.”"
"“噢，饶了我吧！”妻子难过地回答道，“求求你别再看那颗痣。我永远也忘不了你抽搐般的战栗。”","“Oh, spare me!” sadly replied his wife.“Pray do not look at it again.I never can forget that convulsive shudder.”"
"为了安抚乔治亚娜，或者说是为了让她摆脱现实的烦恼，艾尔默用了一些轻松而有趣的奥秘，这些是他从博大精深的科学中学到的。虚幻的人物、无形的意念、飘渺的美景一齐出现，舞动在她的眼前，在道道光束上留下它们转瞬即逝的脚步。尽管乔治亚娜对如何制造这些光学现象略知一二，但这种幻觉近乎于完美，这足以使她相信自己的丈夫有支配精神世界的力量。接着，她想从这密室往外看看，但很快，就像这念头得到了回应似的，外界的一切顺次从她的眼帘掠过。现实生活中的景象与人物都完美地展现在她的眼前，风格迥异而令人心醉神迷。而这种迥异的风格往往能创造出高于原作的画卷、影像、或是影子。看够这些后，艾尔默让乔治亚娜看一个装了土的容器。乔治亚娜看了过去，刚开始没怎么在意；但很快便惊奇地发现，一颗胚芽正破土而出。接着长出了纤细的根茎，叶片也渐渐舒展开来，中间开了一朵娇嫩可爱的花。","In order to soothe Georgiana, and, as it were, to release her mind from the burden of actual things, Aylmer now put in practice some of the light and playful secrets which science had taught him among its profounder lore.Airy figures, absolutely bodiless ideas, and forms of unsubstantial beauty came and danced before her, imprinting their momentary footsteps on beams of light.Though she had some indistinct idea of the method of these optical phenomena, still the illusion was almost perfect enough to warrant the belief that her husband possessed sway over the spiritual world.Then again, when she felt a wish to look forth from her seclusion, immediately, as if her thoughts were answered, the procession of external existence flitted across a screen.The scenery and the figures of actual life were perfectly represented, but with that bewitching, yet indescribable difference which always makes a picture, an image, or a shadow so much more attractive than the original.When wearied of this, Aylmer bade her cast her eyes upon a vessel containing a quantity of earth.She did so, with little interest at first; but was soon startled to perceive the germ of a plant shooting upward from the soil.Then came the slender stalk; the leaves gradually unfolded themselves; and amid them was a perfect and lovely flower."
"“太神奇了！”乔治亚娜叫道，“可我不敢碰它。”","“It is magical!” cried Georgiana.“I dare not touch it.”"
"“别怕，把那朵花摘下来，”艾尔默回答道，“摘下来，赶紧吸进那瞬间的花香。这花一会儿就要枯萎，除了棕色的种子壳什么也不会留下；但是它将繁衍出与它一样短命的花来。”","“Nay, pluck it,” answered Aylmer,—“pluck it, and inhale its brief perfume while you may.The flower will wither in a few moments and leave nothing save its brown seed vessels; but thence may be perpetuated a race as ephemeral as itself.”"
"但是乔治亚娜一碰到那朵花，整棵花就枯萎了，叶子变得炭黑，就像被火烧过一样。","But Georgiana had no sooner touched the flower than the whole plant suffered a blight, its leaves turning coal-black as if by the agency of fire."
"“这种刺激太强烈了。”艾尔默若有所思地说。","“There was too powerful a stimulus,” said Aylmer, thoughtfully."
"为了补偿这失败的实验，艾尔默提议用自己发明的一种科学方法，给妻子画一幅肖像。这要通过光线射在抛光的金属板上来实现。乔治亚娜同意了；但是一看结果，那个肖像轮廓模糊，难以辨认，把她吓了一跳；而本来应该是脸颊的地方却出现了一只手形。艾尔默一把抓过那个金属板，扔到一坛腐蚀酸中。","To make up for this abortive experiment, he proposed to take her portrait by a scientific process of his own invention.It was to be effected by rays of light striking upon a polished plate of metal.Georgiana assented; but, on looking at the result, was affrighted to find the features of the portrait blurred and indefinable; while the minute figure of a hand appeared where the cheek should have been.Aylmer snatched the metallic plate and threw it into a jar of corrosive acid."
"然而，他很快就忘记了那些羞辱难当的失败。在进行研究和化学实验的空档，他跑到乔治亚娜跟前，满脸通红，精疲力竭，但似乎有她在身边又精神百倍，于是眉飞色舞地谈论着他那些成果所用的科学手段。他说起一代代的炼金术士那些人长年累月寻求一种万能溶剂，它可以从所有恶劣低俗的事物中提炼出黄金来。艾尔默似乎相信，凭着最简单的科学原理，要找到人们追寻已久的这一媒介还是有可能的；“但是，”他补充说，“任何为了练就此本领而深入钻研的哲学家都智慧非凡，而不屑于屈尊去做这种事。”关于这长生不老药的发展历程，他的观点很独特。他毫不隐讳地声称，他可以随意配制一种药水，将生命无限延长；但这会破坏自然界的和谐，主要是那些服用这长生不老药的人会来诅咒。","Soon, however, he forgot these mortifying failures.In the intervals of study and chemical experiment he came to her flushed and exhausted, but seemed invigorated by her presence, and spoke in glowing language of the resources of his art.He gave a history of the long dynasty of the alchemists, who spent so many ages in quest of the universal solvent by which the golden principle might be elicited from all things vile and base.Aylmer appeared to believe that, by the plainest scientific logic, it was altogether within the limits of possibility to discover this long-sought medium; “but,” he added, “a philosopher who should go deep enough to acquire the power would attain too lofty a wisdom to stoop to the exercise of it.”Not less singular were his opinions in regard to the elixir vitae.He more than intimated that it was at his option to concoct a liquid that should prolong life for years, perhaps interminably; but that it would produce a discord in Nature which all the world, and chiefly the quaffer of the immortal nostrum, would find cause to curse."
"“艾尔默，你说的是真的？”乔治亚娜看着他，心中又惊又怕，“有这样的能力太可怕了，甚至希望有这样的能力也很可怕。”","“Aylmer, are you in earnest?” asked Georgiana, looking at him with amazement and fear.“It is terrible to possess such power, or even to dream of possessing it.”"
"“哦，我亲爱的，别发抖，”艾尔默说，“我不会给我们的生活带来这些乱七八糟的影响，这会害了咱俩；但我要你想想，相比较而言，祛除这只小手印所需要的技能是多么微不足道。”","“Oh, do not tremble, my love,” said her husband.“I would not wrong either you or myself by working such inharmonious effects upon our lives; but I would have you consider how trifling, in comparison, is the skill requisite to remove this little hand.”"
"一提到那颗胎痣，乔治亚娜又像平常一样畏缩起来，像是一块炽热的烙铁烫到她的脸一样。","At the mention of the birthmark, Georgiana, as usual, shrank as if a redhot iron had touched her cheek."
"艾尔默又投身到自己的工作中。乔治亚娜可以听到远处锅炉房里丈夫指挥阿米纳达布的声音，阿米纳达布应答的声音刺耳粗俗而又古怪，更像是一头野兽在嘟囔或咆哮，而不是人在说话。几个小时后，艾尔默又回来了，他提议妻子去检查他那放置化学品和大自然宝藏的橱柜。艾尔默从化学药品中挑了一个小药水瓶给妻子看，他说里面装的是一种温和却威力十足的香精，可以使吹遍全国的微风都带上这种香味。这个小瓶子里的东西是无价之宝；他边说边洒了几滴到空气里，整个房间立即弥漫着沁人心脾、令人快活的香味儿。","Again Aylmer applied himself to his labors.She could hear his voice in the distant furnace room giving directions to Aminadab, whose harsh, uncouth, misshapen tones were audible in response, more like the grunt or growl of a brute than human speech.After hours of absence, Aylmer reappeared and proposed that she should now examine his cabinet of chemical products and natural treasures of the earth.Among the former he showed her a small vial, in which, he remarked, was contained a gentle yet most powerful fragrance, capable of impregnating all the breezes that blow across a kingdom.They were of inestimable value, the contents of that little vial; and, as he said so, he threw some of the perfume into the air and filled the room with piercing and invigorating delight."
"“那这是什么？”乔治亚娜指着一个盛着金色液体的小玻璃球问道，“这个真好看，我想这就是延年益寿的灵丹妙药吧。”","“And what is this?” asked Georgiana, pointing to a small crystal globe containing a gold-colored liquid.“It is so beautiful to the eye that I could imagine it the elixir of life.”"
"“从某种意义上来说是的，”艾尔默回答说，“或者说就是长生不老药。这是世上迄今为止配制出来的最宝贵的毒药。有了它，无论你指向哪个人，我都可以限定这人的寿命。这剂药的效力可以决定他是可以苟延残喘几年，还是突然倒地身亡。即使戒备森严，也没有哪个国王可以保住性命，如果我在自己的实验室决定，为了百万民众的福祉，需要夺取他的生命的话。”","“In one sense it is,” replied Aylmer; “or, rather, the elixir of immortality.It is the most precious poison that ever was concocted in this world.By its aid I could apportion the lifetime of any mortal at whom you might point your finger.The strength of the dose would determine whether he were to linger out years, or drop dead in the midst of a breath.No king on his guarded throne could keep his life if I, in my private station, should deem that the welfare of millions justified me in depriving him of it.”"
"“你为什么要保留这么可怕的药水？”乔治亚娜吓坏了。","“Why do you keep such a terrific drug?” inquired Georgiana in horror."
"“不要怀疑我，亲爱的，”这位丈夫微笑着说，“它药效的好处比害处要大得多。你看看！这是多么奇妙的化妆品啊。在一瓶水里滴上几滴，雀斑很容易就可以洗掉，就像把手洗干净一样。如果提高溶液浓度，就能去掉脸上的血色，把脸色最红润的美女变成一个苍白的幽灵。”","“Do not mistrust me, dearest,” said her husband, smiling; “its virtuous potency is yet greater than its harmful one.But see! here is a powerful cosmetic.With a few drops of this in a vase of water, freckles may be washed away as easily as the hands are cleansed.A stronger infusion would take the blood out of the cheek, and leave the rosiest beauty a pale ghost.”"
"“你是不是打算用这溶液来给我洗脸啊？”乔治亚娜急切地问道。","“Is it with this lotion that you intend to bathe my cheek?” asked Georgiana, anxiously."
"“哦，不，”丈夫急忙回答说，“这只用于表面治疗。你的情况需要一种效力更高的药物。”","“Oh, no,” hastily replied her husband; “this is merely superficial.Your case demands a remedy that shall go deeper.”"
"艾尔默与乔治亚娜交谈时，通常要细细询问她感受如何，是否适应这足不出户的生活和屋里的气温。这些问题有着特殊的用意，乔治亚娜开始怀疑自己的身体受到了一定的影响，或是因为她吸入了那些芳香的空气，或是食物没吃对。她还幻想着，但可能也只能幻想，她的整个身体在翻腾——一种奇怪、难以言状的感觉在血管里流淌，在她的心里激发起喜忧参半的感觉。无论她什么时候鼓足勇气照照镜子，都能看到那如白玫瑰般苍白的脸，还有脸上那颗深红色的胎痣。现在乔治亚娜比艾尔默都更憎恨这颗胎痣了。","In his interviews with Georgiana, Aylmer generally made minute inquiries as to her sensations and whether the confinement of the rooms and the temperature of the atmosphere agreed with her.These questions had such a particular drift that Georgiana began to conjecture that she was already subjected to certain physical influences, either breathed in with the fragrant air or taken with her food.She fancied likewise, but it might be altogether fancy, that there was a stirring up of her system—a strange, indefinite sensation creeping through her veins, and tingling, half painfully, half pleasurably, at her heart.Still, whenever she dared to look into the mirror, there she beheld herself pale as a white rose and with the crimson birthmark stamped upon her cheek.Not even Aylmer now hated it so much as she."
"丈夫潜心去做合成分析了，为了打发这段无聊的时间，乔治亚娜翻开了丈夫科研室里的几本书。在一堆灰暗陈旧的大部头书里，她读到了几个章节，其内容都是传奇小说和诗歌。这是中世纪哲学家的作品，比如大阿尔伯图斯、科尔内留斯·阿格里帕、帕拉塞尔瑟斯，还有那个著名的行乞修道士，是他造就了有预言能力的“黄铜头颅”。所有这些古老的自然主义学者都走在其所处时代的前列，然而却容易为那些时代所迷惑，因此他们也得到了人们的信任，或许他们还以为自己从对大自然的研究中获得了超越大自然的力量，从物质世界获得了支配精神世界的力量。早期的《皇家学会会刊》也充满好奇心和想象力，其成员对自然潜力的界限知之甚少，却不断地记载奇迹或提出可以创造奇迹的办法。","To dispel the tedium of the hours which her husband found it necessary to devote to the processes of combination and analysis, Georgiana turned over the volumes of his scientific library.In many dark old tomes she met with chapters full of romance and poetry.They were the works of philosophers of the middle ages, such as Albertus Magnus, Cornelius Agrippa, Paracelsus, and the famous friar who created the prophetic Brazen Head.All these antique naturalists stood in advance of their centuries, yet were imbued with some of their credulity, and therefore were believed, and perhaps imagined themselves to have acquired from the investigation of Nature a power above Nature, and from physics a sway over the spiritual world.Hardly less curious and imaginative were the early volumes of the Transactions of the Royal Society, in which the members, knowing little of the limits of natural possibility, were continually recording wonders or proposing methods whereby wonders might be wrought."
"但对于乔治亚娜而言，最引人入胜的是她丈夫亲手写的一大本日志，里面记录了他科研生涯里的每一个实验，实验的最初目标，实验过程所采用的各种方法，实验是以成功还是失败告终，以及导致这些结果的原因。事实上，这本书记载并象征着艾尔默热情洋溢、雄心勃勃、富于想象且务实、勤奋的生活。对他而言，掌握自然科学的种种细节是件至高无上的事情；然而他把所有细节都精神化，用他对这个浩瀚宇宙强烈而迫切的渴望把自己从物质主义中解救出来。在他看来，连最结实的土疙瘩也有了灵魂。乔治亚娜一边读，一边更加敬仰和喜爱艾尔默了，但却不像以前那样盲目相信他的观点了。尽管丈夫成就卓著，乔治亚娜却认为，如果同丈夫所追求的理想目标相比，他那些最辉煌的成功几乎无一例外都是失败。与那些无法企及的无价之宝相比，他最闪亮的钻石不过就是鹅卵石。而只有他自己认为它是钻石。那本日志里记载的全是为作者赢得荣誉的成就，然而它们却充满忧伤，就像出自于死神之笔一样。这本书是忏悔录，笔调悲伤，例证丰富，描述了这位复杂人物的种种缺点——其精神之下仍然是泥土和劳作的物质实体，还描述了他发现自己遭到世俗的阻挠时悲痛欲绝的心情。也许任何领域的天才都会在艾尔默的日志中找到自己过往的影子。","But to Georgiana the most engrossing volume was a large folio from her husband’s own hand, in which he had recorded every experiment of his scientific career, its original aim, the methods adopted for its development, and its final success or failure, with the circumstances to which either event was attributable.The book, in truth, was both the history and emblem of his ardent, ambitious, imaginative, yet practical and laborious life.He handled physical details as if there were nothing beyond them; yet spiritualized them all, and redeemed himself from materialism by his strong and eager aspiration towards the infinite.In his grasp the veriest clod of earth assumed a soul.Georgiana, as she read, reverenced Aylmer and loved him more profoundly than ever, but with a less entire dependence on his judgment than heretofore.Much as he had accomplished, she could not but observe that his most splendid successes were almost invariably failures, if compared with the ideal at which he aimed.His brightest diamonds were the merest pebbles, and felt to be so by himself, in comparison with the inestimable gems which lay hidden beyond his reach.The volume, rich with achievements that had won renown for its author, was yet as melancholy a record as ever mortal hand had penned.It was the sad confession and continual exemplification of the shortcomings of the composite man, the spirit burdened with clay and working in matter, and of the despair that assails the higher nature at finding itself so miserably thwarted by the earthly part.Perhaps every man of genius in whatever sphere might recognize the image of his own experience in Aylmer’s journal."
"这些回忆录深深打动了乔治亚娜，她把脸埋在翻开的书页中，泪水夺眶而出。正在这时，丈夫发现了她。","So deeply did these reflections affect Georgiana that she laid her face upon the open volume and burst into tears.In this situation she was found by her husband."
"“读一个男巫士的书是很危险的，”他微笑着说，尽管他的表情很不自在，也很不快，“乔治亚娜，那本册子里有几页我都读不下去，它们无法让我冷静。小心它们会同样伤害到你。”","“It is dangerous to read in a sorcerer’s books,” said he with a smile, though his countenance was uneasy and displeased.“Georgiana, there are pages in that volume which I can scarcely glance over and keep my senses.Take heed lest it prove as detrimental to you.”"
"“这书让我比以前更加崇拜你了。”乔治亚娜说。","“It has made me worship you more than ever,” said she."
"“啊，等这个实验成功，”他又说，“那时再来崇拜我吧，如果你还愿意的话。我认为我很值得崇拜。不过，来吧，我一直在找寻你悦耳的声音。给我唱唱歌吧，亲爱的。”","“Ah, wait for this one success,” rejoined he, “then worship me if you will.I shall deem myself hardly unworthy of it.But come, I have sought you for the luxury of your voice.Sing to me, dearest.”"
"于是，乔治亚娜唱出美妙的歌曲，以解除他精神上的饥渴。然后，他像一个孩童般满怀欣喜地离开，向她保证她还是得继续滞留，只是需要一点儿时间，实验结果已经很明确了。他刚刚离开，乔治亚娜涌起一股难以抗拒的冲动，想要跟着他去。她忘了告诉艾尔默，两三个小时之前，她注意到自己的身体出现了一个症状。是有关那颗致命的胎痣的感受，不痛，但是让她整个人很不自在。她快步跟在丈夫身后，第一次闯进这个实验室。","So she poured out the liquid music of her voice to quench the thirst of his spirit.He then took his leave with a boyish exuberance of gayety, assuring her that her seclusion would endure but a little longer, and that the result was already certain.Scarcely had he departed when Georgiana felt irresistibly impelled to follow him.She had forgotten to inform Aylmer of a symptom which for two or three hours past had begun to excite her attention.It was a sensation in the fatal birthmark, not painful, but which induced a restlessness throughout her system.Hastening after her husband, she intruded for the first time into the laboratory."
"首先映入她眼帘的是那个火炉，那个烧得发烫的工具，炉火燃得正旺，从炉子上堆积的碳灰看，这炉子似乎已经烧了几个世纪。一个过滤器正在高速运转着。屋子里到处都是蒸馏器、试管、汽缸、坩埚，还有其用于化学研究的仪器。旁边一个电动机器随时备用。屋里闷得难受，弥漫着科研过程中产生的各种气体的味道。屋里的布置十分简朴，光秃秃的墙壁、砖砌的地面，看起来很奇怪，因为乔治亚娜已经适应了她闺房里奇妙优雅的氛围。唯一引起她很大兴趣的，是艾尔默自身的情况。","The first thing that struck her eye was the furnace, that hot and feverish worker, with the intense glow of its fire, which by the quantities of soot clustered above it seemed to have been burning for ages.There was a distilling apparatus in full operation.Around the room were retorts, tubes, cylinders, crucibles, and other apparatus of chemical research.An electrical machine stood ready for immediate use.The atmosphere felt oppressively close, and was tainted with gaseous odors which had been tormented forth by the processes of science.The severe and homely simplicity of the apartment, with its naked walls and brick pavement, looked strange, accustomed as Georgiana had become to the fantastic elegance of her boudoir.But what chiefly, indeed almost solely, drew her attention, was the aspect of Aylmer himself."
"他像死人一样脸色惨白，焦虑不安，全神贯注，紧靠着火炉，好像这火炉需要他高度警惕，不管这蒸馏水正在酝酿永恒的幸福生活还是悲惨的命运。他这副样子与他之前鼓励乔治亚娜时乐观快乐的神情有着天壤之别！","He was pale as death, anxious and absorbed, and hung over the furnace as if it depended upon his utmost watchfulness whether the liquid which it was distilling should be the draught of immortal happiness or misery.How different from the sanguine and joyous mien that he had assumed for Georgiana’s encouragement!"
"“阿米纳达布，现在要小心点儿；要小心，你这个人形机器；小心点儿，你这个土人！”艾尔默抱怨道，更像是自言自语，而不是在对他助手说，“现在，哪怕思想上稍有差池，一切就都完了。”","“Carefully now, Aminadab; carefully, thou human machine; carefully, thou man of clay!” muttered Aylmer, more to himself than his assistant.“Now, if there be a thought too much or too little, it is all over.”"
"“嗬嗬！”阿米纳达布咕哝道，“看，主人！快看！”","“Ho! ho!” mumbled Aminadab.“Look, master! look!”"
"艾尔默连忙抬眼望去，开始满脸涨红，接着，看到乔治亚娜的那一刻，他的脸比平常更加惨白了。他向妻子冲过去，一把抓住她的胳膊，胳膊上多了几个手指印。","Aylmer raised his eyes hastily, and at first reddened, then grew paler than ever, on beholding Georgiana.He rushed towards her and seized her arm with a gripe that left the print of his fingers upon it."
"“你怎么来了？你不信任自己的丈夫吗？”他急躁地叫喊着，“你要让那致命的胎痣来影响我的工作吗？实验还没有结束呢。走，偷看的女人，快走！”","“Why do you come hither?Have you no trust in your husband?” cried he, impetuously.“Would you throw the blight of that fatal birthmark over my labors?It is not well done.Go, prying woman, go!”"
"“不，艾尔默，”乔治亚娜坚定地说，语气里透着与生俱来的坚定，“你没有权利抱怨。你不信任自己的妻子；你十分担心这个实验的进展，而你却隐瞒了这一点。不要这样瞧不起我，我的夫君。告诉我我们要面临的所有风险，不要害怕我会退缩；因为我所面临的风险远远少于你要面临的。”","“Nay, Aylmer,” said Georgiana with the firmness of which she possessed no stinted endowment, “it is not you that have a right to complain.You mistrust your wife; you have concealed the anxiety with which you watch the development of this experiment.Think not so unworthily of me, my husband.Tell me all the risk we run, and fear not that I shall shrink; for my share in it is far less than your own.”"
"“不，不，乔治亚娜！”艾尔默不耐烦地说，“一定不会这样的。”","“No, no, Georgiana!” said Aylmer, impatiently; “it must not be.”"
"“我听你的，”她镇定地回答，“并且，艾尔默，无论你给我带来什么后果我都会接受；即使你亲自给我一剂毒药让我服用，我同样也会接受。”","“I submit,” replied she calmly.“And, Aylmer, I shall quaff whatever draught you bring me; but it will be on the same principle that would induce me to take a dose of poison if offered by your hand.”"
"“我高贵的妻子，”艾尔默被深深地打动了，他说：“直到现在我才知道你多么高尚、多么可贵。我没有什么可隐瞒你的。你要知道，尽管这个深红色的手看起来无足轻重，但它却紧紧地抓住了你的内心，我之前没想到它的力量会如此之大。我已经启用了一些药品，其药效除了不能改变你的整个生理机能，其他任何事情都可以做到。只剩一件事还要试一试。如果这点失败了，那我们就全完了。”","“My noble wife,” said Aylmer, deeply moved, “I knew not the height and depth of your nature until now.Nothing shall be concealed.Know, then, that this crimson hand, superficial as it seems, has clutched its grasp into your being with a strength of which I had no previous conception.I have already administered agents powerful enough to do aught except to change your entire physical system.Only one thing remains to be tried.If that fail us we are ruined.”"
"“为什么以前你不肯告诉我这些？”","“Why did you hesitate to tell me this?” asked she."
"“因为，乔治亚娜，”艾尔默小声说，“这是有危险的。”","“Because, Georgiana,” said Aylmer, in a low voice, “there is danger.”"
"“危险？只有一个危险——就是这个可怕的耻辱还会留在我脸上！”乔治亚娜叫道，“祛掉它，祛掉它，无论付出多大代价，否则我们俩都要疯的！”","“Danger?There is but one danger—that this horrible stigma shall be left upon my cheek!” cried Georgiana.“Remove it, remove it, whatever be the cost, or we shall both go mad!”"
"“上天也知道你的话太对了，”艾尔默难过地说，“亲爱的，现在回你房间里去吧。再过一会儿，一切都会得到验证。”","“Heaven knows your words are too true,” said Aylmer, sadly.“And now, dearest, return to your boudoir.In a little while all will be tested.”"
"他把乔治亚娜送回去，与她告别，温柔的神情中透着些许严肃，这比他的言语更能说明，事情危在旦夕。他一离开，乔治亚娜就陷入了沉思。她仔细思考艾尔默的性格，比过去任何时候都更全面、更公正。她内心狂喜而又颤抖，只为他那高贵的爱——他的爱如此纯洁、高尚，容不下任何不完美的东西，也不会满足于任何逊于他理想的世俗的人性。她觉得这种感情比那些低俗的感情要珍贵得多，因为她的存在，那些感情会变得残缺，会因完美的理念在现实中消磨、背叛神圣的爱情而感到愧疚；有那么一会儿，她全心全意地祈祷，祈祷自己能够满足丈夫最崇高、最深刻的观念。但很快，她也清楚地知道这不可能；因为他的精神仍在不断前进，行进当中的每一刻都要在某些方面超越前一刻。","He conducted her back and took leave of her with a solemn tenderness which spoke far more than his words how much was now at stake.After his departure Georgiana became rapt in musings.She considered the character of Aylmer, and did it completer justice than at any previous moment.Her heart exulted, while it trembled, at his honorable love—so pure and lofty that it would accept nothing less than perfection nor miserably make itself contented with an earthlier nature than he had dreamed of.She felt how much more precious was such a sentiment than that meaner kind which would have borne with the imperfection for her sake, and have been guilty of treason to holy love by degrading its perfect idea to the level of the actual; and with her whole spirit she prayed that, for a single moment, she might satisfy his highest and deepest conception.Longer than one moment she well knew it could not be; for his spirit was ever on the march, ever ascending, and each instant required something that was beyond the scope of the instant before."
"丈夫的脚步声让她从沉思中清醒过来。他拿着一个水晶高脚杯，里面装了像水一样的无色液体，但就像长生不老药般清亮无比。艾尔默脸色惨白；但应该是由于心情异常激动、精神高度紧张造成的，而不是因为害怕或者怀疑。","The sound of her husband’s footsteps aroused her.He bore a crystal goblet containing a liquor colorless as water, but bright enough to be the draught of immortality.Aylmer was pale; but it seemed rather the consequence of a highly-wrought state of mind and tension of spirit than of fear or doubt."
"乔治亚娜看了眼这溶液，于是他回应道，“这溶液很完美，“除非我所有的科学知识都欺骗了我，否则不会失败。”","“The concoction of the draught has been perfect,” said he, in answer to Georgiana’s look.“Unless all my science have deceived me, it cannot fail.”"
"“要不是为了你，我亲爱的艾尔默，”乔治亚娜说，“我愿意放弃生命来祛除这颗致命的胎痣，而不会用其他任何方式。对于那些已经精准地到达我所处的这样一个道德高度的人而言，延续生命是很可悲的。若是我意志薄弱一些、更盲目一些，延续生命也许还是幸福。若是我更坚强一些，或许还能充满希望地生活下去。但是，从我现在的样子来看，我认为我是所有人中最该去死的。”","“Save on your account, my dearest Aylmer,” observed his wife, “I might wish to put off this birthmark of mortality by relinquishing mortality itself in preference to any other mode.Life is but a sad possession to those who have attained precisely the degree of moral advancement at which I stand.Were I weaker and blinder it might be happiness.Were I stronger, it might be endured hopefully.But, being what I find myself, methinks I am of all mortals the most fit to die.”"
"“你不需要品尝死亡的味道就可以到达天堂！”丈夫回答道，“但是我们为什么要说到死亡呢？这个药剂不可能失败。看看这个药剂在这颗植物上产生的效果。”","“You are fit for heaven without tasting death!” replied her husband “But why do we speak of dying?The draught cannot fail.Behold its effect upon this plant.”"
"窗户边有一棵天竺葵，病怏怏的，叶子上布满了黄色的斑点。艾尔默倒了一点儿液体在天竺葵生长的土壤中。不一会儿，植物的根吸收了水分，难看的斑点逐渐消失在鲜活的翠绿色中。","On the window seat there stood a geranium diseased with yellow blotches, which had overspread all its leaves.Aylmer poured a small quantity of the liquid upon the soil in which it grew.In a little time, when the roots of the plant had taken up the moisture, the unsightly blotches began to be extinguished in a living verdure."
"“你不需要证明，”乔治亚娜平静地说，“把杯子给我，我会欣然印证你的话的。”","“There needed no proof,” said Georgiana, quietly.“Give me the goblet I joyfully stake all upon your word.”"
"“那就喝下去，你这高尚的人儿！”艾尔默大叫，爱慕之情溢于言表，“你的精神上没有任何残缺的痕迹。你那敏感的身体也很快就会变得十全十美。”","“Drink, then, thou lofty creature!” exclaimed Aylmer, with fervid admiration.“There is no taint of imperfection on thy spirit.Thy sensible frame, too, shall soon be all perfect.”"
"乔治亚娜喝干了液体，把杯子放到丈夫手中。","She quaffed the liquid and returned the goblet to his hand."
"“真好喝，”她平静地笑着说，“我觉得这像是天堂里的泉水；因为它有一种淡淡的、难以言状的芳香和美味。它缓解了多日以来让我火烧火燎的干渴。现在，亲爱的，让我睡会儿吧。我这世俗的感官将我的精神慢慢包围，就像在日落时分，树叶将玫瑰花心包裹一样。”","“It is grateful,” said she with a placid smile.“Methinks it is like water from a heavenly fountain; for it contains I know not what of unobtrusive fragrance and deliciousness.It allays a feverish thirst that had parched me for many days.Now, dearest, let me sleep.My earthly senses are closing over my spirit like the leaves around the heart of a rose at sunset.”"
"她艰难地说出最后几个字，那几个微弱的、气若游丝的音节仿佛用尽了她浑身的力气。刚说完这几句话她就沉沉睡去。艾尔默坐在妻子身边，仔细观察着她，心中百感交集，就像是在他在这个实验中的价值要面临检验一样。然而，这位科学人士除了有这样的心境外，他那哲学式的研究方法也是其一大特色。即便是最细微的症状都躲不过他的眼睛。乔治亚娜脸颊泛起红晕，呼吸有点儿不均匀，眼皮微微一颤，身体有一丝难以察觉的颤动——随着时间的推移，这些细节他都要记录在手册里。这个手册前面的每一页都是他深思熟虑的成果，但历经岁月而沉淀下来的思想都浓缩在这最后一页。","She spoke the last words with a gentle reluctance, as if it required almost more energy than she could command to pronounce the faint and lingering syllables.Scarcely had they loitered through her lips ere she was lost in slumber.Aylmer sat by her side, watching her aspect with the emotions proper to a man the whole value of whose existence was involved in the process now to be tested.Mingled with this mood, however, was the philosophic investigation characteristic of the man of science.Not the minutest symptom escaped him.A heightened flush of the cheek, a slight irregularity of breath, a quiver of the eyelid, a hardly perceptible tremor through the frame,—such were the details which, as the moments passed, he wrote down in his folio volume.Intense thought had set its stamp upon every previous page of that volume, but the thoughts of years were all concentrated upon the last."
"这些事情做完了，他还不忘时常关注一下那只致命的小手印，每次都会为之颤抖。但是有一次，在一种奇怪的、不可名状的冲动驱使下，他亲吻了下这只小手印。然而就是这一举动使他意志退缩了，乔治亚娜即使睡得正香，也会动一动，喃喃说着什么，好像在抱怨什么。艾尔默又仔细观察了下。这不是徒劳无益的。起初，那只深红色的小手印在乔治亚娜大理石般苍白脸颊的映衬下清楚可见，现在，小手印的轮廓变得越发模糊。她和以前一样苍白；但她每呼吸一次，那颗胎痣似乎便没以前那么明显了。胎痣的存在太可怕了；胎痣消失却更加可怕。看看彩虹在天空中渐渐淡去的过程，你就会知道那颗神秘的标志是如何消失的。","While thus employed, he failed not to gaze often at the fatal hand, and not without a shudder.Yet once, by a strange and unaccountable impulse he pressed it with his lips.His spirit recoiled, however, in the very act, and Georgiana, out of the midst of her deep sleep, moved uneasily and murmured as if in remonstrance.Again Aylmer resumed his watch.Nor was it without avail.The crimson hand, which at first had been strongly visible upon the marble paleness of Georgiana’s cheek, now grew more faintly outlined.She remained not less pale than ever; but the birthmark with every breath that came and went, lost somewhat of its former distinctness.Its presence had been awful; its departure was more awful still.Watch the stain of the rainbow fading out the sky, and you will know how that mysterious symbol passed away."
"“天啊！胎痣几乎就没有了！”艾尔默自言自语道，那种狂喜无法抑制，“我现在几乎看不到它了。成功了！成功了！现在看起来就像很浅的玫瑰色。她脸上的一丝血色就能将其掩盖。可她却脸色苍白！”","“By Heaven! it is well-nigh gone!” said Aylmer to himself, in almost irrepressible ecstasy.“I can scarcely trace it now.Success! success!And now it is like the faintest rose color.The lightest flush of blood across her cheek would overcome it.But she is so pale!”"
"艾尔默把窗帘拉到一边，让阳光照进屋子，照在妻子脸上。就在那时，他听到一声粗鲁沙哑的笑声，他知道那是他的助手阿米纳达布表示高兴的方式。","He drew aside the window curtain and suffered the light of natural day to fall into the room and rest upon her cheek.At the same time he heard a gross, hoarse chuckle, which he had long known as his servant Aminadab’s expression of delight."
"“啊，泥巴坨！啊，大泥块！”艾尔默疯狂地笑着说，“你真是帮了我大忙！物质与精神——大地与天堂——在这个试验中都尽到自己的力量！笑吧，有感觉的东西！你现在有权利笑了。”","“Ah, clod! ah, earthly mass!” cried Aylmer, laughing in a sort of frenzy, “you have served me well!Matter and spirit—earth and heaven—have both done their part in this!Laugh, thing of the senses!You have earned the right to laugh.”"
"这些叫喊声打断了乔治亚娜的睡眠。她慢慢睁开眼睛，盯着丈夫事先给她准备好的镜子。乔治亚娜嘴角泛起微弱的笑容，她注意到，那只深红色的小手印现在几乎看不出来了，而它曾经闪耀着可怕的光芒，将他们所有的幸福吓跑。但接着，她的眼睛扫过艾尔默的脸庞，眼里透着苦恼和焦虑，这是他怎么也无法理解的。","These exclamations broke Georgiana’s sleep.She slowly unclosed her eyes and gazed into the mirror which her husband had arranged for that purpose.A faint smile flitted over her lips when she recognized how barely perceptible was now that crimson hand which had once blazed forth with such disastrous brilliancy as to scare away all their happiness.But then her eyes sought Aylmer’s face with a trouble and anxiety that he could by no means account for."
"“我可怜的艾尔默！”她喃喃地说道。","“My poor Aylmer!” murmured she."
"“可怜？不，我是最富有、最幸福、最得宠的人！”他大声叫道，“我的绝世无双的新娘啊，试验成功了！你是完美的！”","“Poor?Nay, richest, happiest, most favored!” exclaimed he.“My peerless bride, it is successful!You are perfect!”"
"“我可怜的艾尔默，”她又说了一遍，虚弱的声音中透着温柔，“你目标远大；行为高尚。不要因为你拒绝了尘世间赐予你的最好的东西，就用如此高尚纯洁的感情来忏悔。艾尔默，我亲爱的艾尔默，我就要死了！”","“My poor Aylmer,” she repeated, with a more than human tenderness, “you have aimed loftily; you have done nobly.Do not repent that with so high and pure a feeling, you have rejected the best the earth could offer.Aylmer, dearest Aylmer, I am dying!”"
"天啊！这太真实了！那只致命的小手抓住了生命的奥秘，也正是它，将天使般的心灵同凡人的躯壳结合在了一起。随着那颗胎痣最后一丝红色印记——人类缺陷的唯一标志——从乔治亚娜脸颊上消失，这个完美女人的最后一丝呼吸也融入到了空气中，她的灵魂在丈夫身边逡巡了片刻，便飞向了天空。接着又传来一声沙哑的咯咯笑声！尘世间凡夫俗子的死亡，就这样战胜了不朽的精神，并为之得意洋洋，固然这精神仍停留在尚待开发的混沌领域中，需要更高层次的完善。然而，若是艾尔默拥有更深刻的智慧，就无需丢弃他的幸福，这幸福原本可以将同样特质的凡人生活与天国里的生活交织融合。这短暂的境遇对艾尔默而言太残酷了；他无法看到时间阴影以外的东西，而且，固时间永恒，却只能来尘世一遭，他也无法在当下找到完美的未来。","Alas! it was too true!The fatal hand had grappled with the mystery of life, and was the bond by which an angelic spirit kept itself in union with a mortal frame.As the last crimson tint of the birthmark—that sole token of human imperfection—faded from her cheek, the parting breath of the now perfect woman passed into the atmosphere, and her soul, lingering a moment near her husband, took its heavenward flight.Then a hoarse, chuckling laugh was heard again!Thus ever does the gross fatality of earth exult in its invariable triumph over the immortal essence which, in this dim sphere of half development, demands the completeness of a higher state.Yet, had Alymer reached a profounder wisdom, he need not thus have flung away the happiness which would have woven his mortal life of the selfsame texture with the celestial.The momentary circumstance was too strong for him; he failed to look beyond the shadowy scope of time, and, living once for all in eternity, to find the perfect future in the present."
