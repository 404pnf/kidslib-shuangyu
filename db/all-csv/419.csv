"The Story of the Yara","亚拉的故事"
"by Andrew Lang","作者：安德鲁•朗格"
"Down in the south, where the sun shines so hotly that everything and everybody sleeps all day, and even the great forests seem silent, except early in the morning and late in the evening—down in this country there once lived a young man and a maiden.","在南方，太阳非常火辣，人和万物整天都在睡觉，就连大森林都看上去静悄悄的，只有每天清晨和傍晚是个例外——在这个村庄曾经生活着一个小伙子和一个少女。"
"The girl had been born in the town, and had scarcely ever left it; but the young man was a native of another country, and had only come to the city near the great river because he could find no work to do where he was.","女孩出生在城市，几乎没有离开过那里；而小伙子却是另一个国家的人，他来到这座位于大河附近的城市，只因为他在自己的国家找不到工作。"
"A few months after his arrival, when the days were cooler, and the people did not sleep so much as usual, a great feast was held a little way out of the town, and to this feast everyone flocked from thirty miles and more.","在他来到这个城市的几个月后，天气变得比较凉爽了，人们也不像平时那样睡得那么多了。在离城市不远的地方举行了一场盛大的宴会，大家都从三十英里之外或更远的地方赶来参加。"
"Some walked and some rode, some came in beautiful golden coaches; but all had on splendid dresses of red or blue, while wreaths of flowers rested on their hair.","有些人步行，有些人骑马，还有些人坐着漂亮的金色马车；但所有人都穿着华丽的红衣服或蓝衣服，头上戴着花环。"
"It was the first time that the youth had been present on such an occasion, and he stood silently aside watching the graceful dances and the pretty games played by the young people.","这个小伙子第一次出席这样的场合，他静静地站在一边，观看年轻人优雅的舞姿和他们玩的可爱小游戏。"
"And as he watched, he noticed one girl, dressed in white with scarlet pomegranates in her hair, who seemed to him lovelier than all the rest.","在他观看的时候，他注意到一个身穿白衣、头戴绯红色石榴花的女孩，在小伙子眼里，她比其他人都可爱。"
"When the feast was over, and the young man returned home, his manner was so strange that it drew the attention of all his friends.","宴会结束后，小伙子回到家里，他的举止非常奇怪，怪得引起了他所有朋友的注意。"
"Through his work next day the youth continued to see the girl’s face, throwing the ball to her companions, or threading her way between them as she danced.","第二天工作的时候，小伙子老是看到女孩的脸，看到她向她的伙伴们抛球，或是跳舞的时候在她们中间穿梭。"
"At night sleep fled from him, and after tossing for hours on his bed, he would get up and plunge into a deep pool that lay a little way in the forest.","晚上，睡意从他身边溜走，在床上辗转反侧几个小时后，他就会起床，来到森林里不远处的一个深水池塘，一头扎进去。"
"This state of things went on for some weeks, then at last chance favoured him.","事情就这样持续了几个星期，然后机会最终垂青了他。"
"One evening, as he was passing near the house where she lived, he saw her standing with her back to the wall, trying to beat off with her fan the attacks of a savage dog that was leaping at her throat.","一天晚上，当他经过女孩家附近的时候，他看见她站在那里，后背贴着墙，正试图用扇子赶跑一只野狗，那狗正要向她的喉咙扑过去。"
"Alonzo, for such was his name, sprang forward, and with one blow of his fist stretched the creature dead upon the road.","阿朗佐，这就是他的名字，他冲上去，一拳就把那只畜生打死在地。"
"He then helped the frightened and half-fainting girl into the large cool verandah where her parents were sitting, and from that hour he was a welcome guest in the house, and it was not long before he was the promised husband of Julia.","然后他把受了惊吓的、处于半昏迷状态的女孩送到一个凉快的大走廊，女孩的父母正坐在那里。从那时起，他就成了那家受欢迎的客人，不久以后，他就成了朱莉娅的未婚夫。"
"Every day, when his work was done, he used to go up to the house, half hidden among flowering plants and brilliant creepers, where humming-birds darted from bush to bush, and parrots of all colours, red and green and grey, shrieked in chorus.","每天，工作结束后，他就常去她家里。房子半掩在鲜花盛开的植物与鲜艳的藤蔓中，蜂鸟在树丛中飞来飞去，各种颜色的鹦鹉，红的、绿的和灰的，也尖声合唱着。"
"There he would find the maiden waiting for him, and they would spend an hour or two under the stars, which looked so large and bright that you felt as if you could almost touch them.","在那里，他会找到正在等待他的少女，他们一起在星空下呆上一两个小时，星星看上去又大又亮，给人一种触手可及的感觉。"
"‘What did you do last night after you went home?’ suddenly asked the girl one evening.","“昨天晚上你回家后做什么了？”一天晚上，女孩突然问道。"
"‘Just the same as I always do,’ answered he.","“就和我平常做的一样啊，”他答道，"
"‘It was too hot to sleep, so it was no use going to bed, and I walked straight of to the forest and bathed in one of those deep dark pools at the edge of the river.","“天太热了，睡不着觉，所以上床也没用，我就直接去了森林，在河边的那些又深又黑的水塘里洗了个澡。"
"I have been there constantly for several months, but last night a strange thing happened.","我经常去那里，已经有好几个月了，但昨天晚上发生了一件怪事。"
"I was taking my last plunge, when I heard—sometimes from one side, and sometimes from another—the sound of a voice singing more sweetly than any nightingale, though I could not catch any words.","我正要扎最后一个猛子的时候，听到了——有时从这边，有时从那边——一阵歌声，这唱歌的声音比任何一只夜莺的歌声都甜美，尽管我没能听清楚任何一个词。"
"I left the pool, and, dressing myself as fast as I could, I searched every bush and tree round the water, as I fancied that perhaps it was my friend who was playing a trick on me, but there was not a creature to be seen; and when I reached home I found my friend fast asleep.’","我赶紧穿上衣服，离开水塘，我找遍了水塘附近的每个灌木丛和每棵树，因为我猜想或许这是我的朋友在和我开玩笑，但我连一只动物都没看到。而且回到家后，我发现我的朋友都睡得正香。”"
"As Julia listened her face grew deadly white, and her whole body shivered as if with cold.","听到他的故事，茱莉娅的脸色变得惨白，她好像很冷，整个身体一直在发抖。"
"From her childhood she had heard stories of the terrible beings that lived in the forests and were hidden under the banks of the rivers, and could only be kept off by powerful charms.","从童年时代起，她就听过关于可怕怪物的故事，怪物们住在森林里，藏在河岸下，只有法力无边的护身符才能驱赶他们。"
"Could the voice which had bewitched Alonzo have come from one of these?","那蛊惑阿朗佐的声音会是来自其中的一个怪物吗？"
"Perhaps, who knows, it might be the voice of the dreaded Yara herself, who sought young men on the eve of their marriage as her prey.","或许，谁知道呢，那可能就是令人恐惧的亚拉本人的声音，她在年轻人结婚的前夜来寻找他们作为猎物。"
"For a moment the girl sat choked with fear, as these thoughts rushed through her; then she said: ‘Alonzo, will you promise something?’","女孩坐在那里，这些念头在她脑海里匆匆闪过，好一会儿都害怕得说不出话来。然后，她说道：“阿朗佐，你能答应我件事吗？”"
"‘What is that?’ asked he.","“什么事？”他问。"
"‘It is something that has to do with our future happiness.’","“这件事和我们将来的幸福有关。”"
"‘Oh! it is serious, then?","“哦，那么，是很严重吧？"
"Well, of course I promise.","好吧，我当然会答应你。"
"Now tell me!’","现在告诉我吧！”"
"‘I want you to promise,’ she answered, lowering her voice to a whisper, ‘never to bathe in those pools again.’","“我想要你答应我，”她回答道，压低了声音悄悄说，“再别去那些水塘游泳了。”"
"‘But why not, queen of my soul; have I not gone there always, and nothing has harmed me, flower of my heart?’","“但为什么不能呢，我灵魂的女王？我不是一直都去那儿的吗？还没有东西伤害过我呀，我心中的花朵。”"
"‘No; but perhaps something will.","“确实没有，但也许将来会有。"
"If you will not promise I shall go mad with fright.","如果你不答应我，我会害怕得发疯的。"
"Promise me.’","答应我吧。”"
"‘Why, what is the matter?","“为什么，出了什么事？"
"You look so pale!","你的脸色如此苍白！"
"Tell me why you are so frightened?’","告诉我，你为什么这么害怕？”"
"‘Did you not hear the song?’ she asked, trembling.","“你难道没听到歌声吗？”她问道，身体颤抖着。"
"‘Suppose I did, how could that hurt me?","“就算我听到了，那怎么能伤害我呢？"
"It was the loveliest song I ever heard!’","那是我听过的最美妙的歌声了！”"
"‘Yes, and after the song will come the apparition; and after that— after that—’","“是的，歌声过后，妖怪就来了，再后来——再后来——”"
"‘I don’t understand.","“我不明白。"
"Well—after that?’","那么——再后来呢？”"
"‘After that—death.’","“再后来——就是死亡。”"
"Alonzo stared at her.","阿朗佐盯着她。"
"Had she really gone mad?","难道她真的疯了？"
"Such talk was very unlike Julia; but before he could collect his senses the girl spoke again:","这样的话一点儿都不像朱莉娅说的。但他还没醒过神来，女孩又说话了："
"‘That is the reason why I implore you never to go there again; at any rate till after we are married.’","“那就是我恳求你别再去那儿的原因。无论如何，等到我们结婚后你再去那儿吧。”"
"‘And what difference will our marriage make?’","“我们的婚姻对这件事有什么影响吗？”"
"‘Oh, there will be no danger then; you can go to bathe as often as you like!’","“哦，那时候就不会有危险了，你可以想去洗几次就去几次。”"
"‘But tell me why you are so afraid?’","“但是，告诉我为什么你这么害怕？”"
"‘Because the voice you heard—I know you will laugh, but it is quite true—it was the voice of the Yara.’","“因为你听到的声音——我知道你会笑我，但那的确是真的——那是亚拉的声音。”"
"At these words Alonzo burst into a shout of laughter; but it sounded so harsh and loud that Julia shrank away shuddering.","听到这些话，阿朗佐大笑了起来，但他的笑声非常刺耳、大声，听得朱莉娅颤抖着缩到了一边。"
"It seemed as if he could not stop himself, and the more he laughed the paler the poor girl became, murmuring to herself as she watched him:","看起来他笑得停不下来了，而且他笑得越厉害，女孩的脸就越苍白，她一边注视着他，一边喃喃自语道："
"‘Oh, heaven! you have seen her! you have seen her! what shall I do?’","“哦，老天！你看到她了！你看到她了！我该怎么办呢？”"
"Faint as was her whisper, it reached the ears of Alonzo, who, though he still could not speak for laughing, shook his head.","尽管她的话非常微弱，但还是被阿朗佐听到了，因为还在笑的缘故，他没法说话，就摇了摇头。"
"‘You may not know it, but it is true.","“你也许不知道，但它是真的。"
"Nobody who has not seen the Yara laughs like that.’","没有见过亚拉的人是不会笑成那样的。”"
" And Julia flung herself on the ground weeping bitterly.","朱莉娅扑倒在地，伤心地哭着。"
"At this sight Alonzo became suddenly grave, and kneeling by her side, gently raised her up.","看到这一幕，阿朗佐突然变得严肃起来，他跪在她身边，温柔地把她扶起来。"
"‘Do not cry so, my angel,’ he said, ‘I will promise anything you please.","“不要这样哭了，我的天使，”他说，“只要你高兴，我什么事都答应你。"
"Only let me see you smile again.’","只要让我再看到你的笑容。”"
"With a great effort Julia checked her sobs, and rose to her feet.","朱莉娅好不容易止住了抽泣，站起身来。"
"‘Thank you,’ she answered.","“谢谢你，”她回答道，"
"‘My heart grows lighter as you say that!","“你那样说，我心里舒服多了！"
"I know you will try to keep your word and to stay away from the forest.","我知道你会尽力信守承诺，远离那个森林的。"
"But—the power of the Yara is very strong, and the sound of her voice is apt to make men forget everything else in the world.","但是——亚拉的法力非常强大，她的声音很容易让男人忘记世上一切其他的东西。"
"Oh, I have seen it, and more than one betrothed maiden lives alone, broken-hearted.","哦，我看到过的，不止一个订过婚的少女带着破碎的心独自生活。"
"If ever you should return to the pool where you first heard the voice, promise me that you will at least take this with you.’","如果你再去那个你第一次听到歌声的水塘，答应我，你至少要把这个带在身上。”"
" And opening a curiously carved box, she took out a sea-shell shot with many colours, and sang a song softly into it.","她打开了一个有着奇特雕刻的盒子，从中拿出一个多彩的贝壳，对着它轻轻地唱了一首歌。"
"‘The moment you hear the Yara’s voice,’ said she, ‘put this to your ear, and you will hear my song instead.","“你一听到亚拉的声音，”她说，“就把这个放到你的耳边，这样你就会改听到我的歌声了。"
"Perhaps—I do not know for certain—but perhaps, I may be stronger than the Yara.’","或许——我不敢肯定——但也许，我可能比亚拉更强大。”"
"It was late that night when Alonzo returned home.","阿朗佐回到家时已经是深夜了。"
"The moon was shining on the distant river, which looked cool and inviting, and the trees of the forest seemed to stretch out their arms and beckon him near.","月亮照着远处的河流，看上去凉爽诱人，森林中的树木好像在伸出双臂，召唤他走近些。"
"But the young man steadily turned his face in the other direction, and went home to bed.","但小伙子坚定地把脸转向另外的方向，回家上床睡觉了。"
"The struggle had been hard, but Alonzo had his reward next day in the joy and relief with which Julia greeted him.","这种挣扎非常艰难，但阿朗佐第二天就得到了回报，朱莉娅喜悦又欣慰地迎接了他。"
"He assured her that having overcome the temptation once the danger was now over; but she, knowing better than he did the magic of the Yara’s face and voice, did not fail to make him repeat his promise when he went away.","他向她保证，既然他已经抵挡住了第一次诱惑，那么危险就过去了。但朱莉娅比他更清楚亚拉面孔和声音的魔力，在他离开时，她还不忘让他重复一遍他的诺言。"
"For three nights Alonzo kept his word, not because he believed in the Yara, for he thought that the tales about her were all nonsense, but because he could not bear the tears with which he knew that Julia would greet him, if he confessed that he had returned to the forest.","接连三个晚上，阿朗佐都恪守承诺，这并不是因为他相信亚拉的存在，他觉得有关亚拉的故事全是一派胡言，而是因为他不忍心看到，如果他承认自己去过森林，朱莉娅见他的时候就会眼泪汪汪的。"
"But, in spite of this, the song rang in his ears, and daily grew louder.","但是，尽管如此，歌声还是在他耳边响起，而且声音一天比一天大。"
"On the fourth night the attraction of the forest grew so strong that neither the thought of Julia nor the promises he had made her could hold him back.","第四个晚上，森林的吸引力变得非常强大，不论是想到朱莉娅还是他的诺言都无法阻止他。"
"At eleven o’clock he plunged into the cool darkness of the trees, and took the path that led straight to the river.","十一点钟的时候，他冲进了阴凉漆黑的树林，踏上了径直通向河边的小路。"
"Yet, for the first time, he found that Julia’s warnings, though he had laughed at her at the moment, had remained in his memory, and he glanced at the bushes with a certain sense of fear which was quite new to him.","可是，他第一次发现，尽管朱莉娅警告他时他还嘲笑过她，但现在她的警告仍留在他脑海中。他的目光扫过灌木丛时，心里感到有些害怕，而这种感觉以前从未有过。"
"When he reached the river he paused and looked round for a moment to make sure that the strange feeling of some one watching him was fancy, and he was really alone.","来到河边后，他停下来向四周看了看，确信那种有人在注视他的奇怪感觉只是他的幻想，他的确是独自一人。"
"But the moon shone brightly on every tree, and nothing was to be seen but his own shadow; nothing was to be heard but the sound of the rippling stream.","但皎洁的月光照在每棵树上，除了他自己的影子，再也看不到别的东西；除了潺潺的水声，再也听不到别的声音。"
"He threw off his clothes, and was just about to dive in headlong, when something—he did not know what—suddenly caused him to look round.","他扔掉衣服，正要一头扎进河里时，忽然有什么东西——他不知道是什么——促使他向四周张望。"
"At the same instant the moon passed from behind a cloud, and its rays fell on a beautiful golden-haired woman standing half hidden by the ferns.","就在这时，月亮从一片云彩后经过，月光落在一个美丽的金发女子身上，她正半掩着自己站在蕨草中。"
"With one bound he caught up his mantle, and rushed headlong down the path he had come, fearing at each step to feel a hand laid on his shoulder.","他一下子跳起来，抓起他的披风，一头冲回他来时的路，每走一步都害怕会有只手放在他肩上。"
"It was not till he had left the last trees behind him, and was standing in the open plain, that he dared to look round, and then he thought a figure in white was still standing there waving her arms to and fro.","直到他把最后一棵树抛在身后，站在了开阔的平原上，他才敢向四周看看。而他仍觉得有个身穿白衣的身影站在那里不停地来回挥着胳膊。"
"This was enough; he ran along the road harder than ever, and never paused till he was save in his own room.","这真是够受了。他比平时更拼命地沿路狂奔，直到跑进自己的房间才停下来。"
"With the earliest rays of dawn he went back to the forest to see whether he could find any traces of the Yara, but though he searched every clump of bushes, and looked up every tree, everything was empty, and the only voices he heard were those of parrots, which are so ugly that they only drive people away.","迎着拂晓的第一缕曙光，他回到森林想看看能不能找到亚拉的任何踪迹。但尽管他找遍了每一堆灌木丛，查看了每一棵树，四周还是空荡荡的。他唯一听到的声音就是鹦鹉的叫声，这难听的声音只会把人赶跑。"
"‘I think I must be mad,’ he said to himself, ‘and have dreamt all that folly’; and going back to the city he began his daily work.","“我想我一定是疯了，”他自言自语道，“竟然梦到了这些荒唐的事。”回到城里，他又开始做自己的日常工作。"
"But either that was harder than usual, or he must be ill, for he could not fix his mind upon it, and everybody he came across during the day inquired if anything had happened to give him that white, frightened look.","但是，工作要么比平时难做，要么就是他生病了，因为他不能集中精力。一整天，他碰到的每个人都问他发生了什么事情，让他的脸色那么苍白可怕。"
"‘I must be feverish,’ he said to himself; ‘after all, it is rather dangerous to take a cold bath when one is feeling so hot.’","“我一定是发烧了，”他自言自语地说，“毕竟，一个人烧得这么厉害的时候去洗冷水澡是非常危险的。”"
" Yet he knew, while he said it, that he was counting the hours for night to come, that he might return to the forest.","可是他知道，在说这些话时，他正数着时间，盼望着夜晚的到来，他可能还会再到森林去。"
"In the evening he went as usual to the creeper-covered house.","晚上，他像往常一样去了爬满藤蔓的房子。"
"But he had better have stayed away, as his face was so pale and his manner so strange, that the poor girl saw that something terrible had occurred.","但其实他还不如不去，因为他的脸色非常苍白、举止非常怪异，可怜的女孩一见他便知道可怕的事已经发生了。"
"Alonzo, however, refused to answer any of her questions, and all she could get was a promise to hear everything the next day.","然而，阿朗佐拒绝回答她的任何问题，她所能得到的承诺就是第二天小伙子告诉她发生的一切。"
"On pretence of a violent headache, he left Julia much earlier than usual and hurried quickly home.","他假装说自己头疼得厉害，比平时早早地离开了朱莉娅，急匆匆地跑回家。"
"Taking down a pistol, he loaded it and put it in his belt, and a little before midnight he stole out on the tips of his toes, so as to disturb nobody.","他取下一把手枪，装上子弹，把它挂在腰带上。快到半夜的时候，他踮着脚尖偷偷溜出去，这样就不会打扰其他人。"
"Once outside he hastened down the road which led to the forest.","一到外面，他就急匆匆地踏上了去往森林的路。"
"He did not stop till he had reached the river pool, when holding the pistol in his hand, he looked about him.","他到了水塘边才停下来，手里握着枪，向四周看了看。"
"At every little noise—the falling of a leaf, the rustle of an animal in the bushes, the cry of a night-bird—he sprang up and cocked his pistol in the direction of the sound.","一听到细微的声音——落叶的声音、灌木丛中动物的沙沙声、夜鸟的叫声——他都会跳起来，朝着声音传来的方向开枪。"
"But though the moon still shone he saw nothing, and by and by a kind of dreamy state seemed to steal over him as he leant against a tree.","尽管月亮照耀着，但他还是什么也看不到。不久之后，他靠着一棵树，睡意渐渐袭来。"
"How long he remained in this condition he could not have told, but suddenly he awoke with a start, on hearing his name uttered softly.","像这样子过了多久，他也说不清楚，但一听到有人柔声喊着他的名字，他突然受到惊吓，醒了过来，"
"‘Who is that?’ he cried, standing upright instantly; but only an echo answered him.","“你是谁？”他立刻站直了身体喊道，但只有回音在回答他。"
"Then his eyes grew fascinated with the dark waters of the pool close to his feet, and he looked at it as if he could never look away.","然后，他的视线被近在脚边的水塘里的黑漆漆的水迷住了。他看着它，仿佛永远无法把视线移开。"
"He gazed steadily into the depths for some minutes, when he became aware that down in the darkness was a bright spark, which got rapidly bigger and brighter.","他接连几分钟都一动不动地凝视着水的深处，他注意到黑暗深处有个明亮的火花，正快速变得更大、更亮。"
"Again that feeling of awful fear took possession of him, and he tried to turn his eyes from the pool.","可怕的恐惧感再次笼罩了他，他试图把视线从水塘上移开。"
"But it was no use; something stronger than himself compelled him to keep them there.","但没什么用；某种比他更强大的东西迫使他的眼睛看着水塘。"
"At last the waters parted softly, and floating on the surface he saw the beautiful woman whom he had fled from only a few nights before.","最后，水轻轻地分开了，他看到一个漂亮的女子漂浮在水面上。几个夜晚前，他就是从她身边逃走的。"
"He turned to run, but his feet were glued to the spot.","他转身想跑，但他的双脚却好像被粘在地上一样。"
"She smiled at him and held out her arms, but as she did so there came over him the remembrance of Julia, as he had seen her a few hours earlier, and her warnings and fears for the very danger in which he now found himself.","她冲他微笑着，伸出双臂。但她这样做的时候，阿朗佐想到了朱莉娅，几个小时前他才刚刚见过她，他还想到了她对这一危险的警告和害怕，而现在他正身处其中。"
"Meanwhile the figure was always drawing nearer, nearer; but, with a violent effort, Alonzo shook off his stupor, and taking aim at her shoulder he pulled the trigger.","与此同时，那身影越来越近，但阿朗佐费了好大的力气才从恍惚中摆脱出来，瞄准她的肩膀，扣动了扳机。"
"The report awoke the sleeping echoes, and was repeated all through the forest, but the figure smiled still, and went on advancing.","枪声唤醒了沉睡的回声，在森林里回荡，但那身影却依然微笑着向他走来。"
"Again Alonzo fired, and a second time the bullet whistled through the air, and the figure advanced nearer.","阿朗佐又开了一枪，子弹第二次嗖地从空中飞过，那身影走得更近了。"
"A moment more, and she would be at his side.","又过了一会儿，她就在他的身边了。"
"Then, his pistol being empty, he grasped the barrel with both hands, and stood ready to use it as a club should the Yara approach and closer.","后来，他的枪没子弹了，他就双手紧抓枪管，站在那里，准备把它当棍棒用，以防亚拉再靠近。"
"But now it seemed her turn to feel afraid, for she paused an instant while he pressed forward, still holding the pistol above his head, prepared to strike.","但是，现在好像是轮到她感到害怕了，因为当阿朗佐向前逼近，把手枪高举过头顶、准备砸出去的时候，她停了一下。"
"In his excitement he had forgotten the river, and it was not till the cold water touched his feet that he stood still by instinct.","他激动得忘记了河流的存在，直到冰冷的河水碰到他的双脚，他才本能地站住了。"
"The Yara saw that he was wavering, and suffering herself to sway gently backwards and forwards on the surface of the river, she began to sing.","亚拉看到他有些动摇，就忍着在水面上来回轻摆的痛苦，唱起了歌。"
"The song floated through the trees, now far and now near; no one could tell whence it came, the whole air seemed full of it.","歌声飘过树林，忽远忽近；没有人能说出歌声从哪里来，好像空气中都充满了歌声。"
"Alonzo felt his senses going and his will failing.","阿朗佐觉得他正在失去理智，意志力也在减弱。"
"His arms dropped heavily to his side, but in falling struck against the sea shell, which, as he had promised Julia, he had always carried in his coat.","他的双臂重重垂了下去，碰到了贝壳，就像他答应朱莉娅的那样，他总是把它放在衣服里。"
"His dimmed mind was just clear enough to remember what she had said, and with trembling fingers, that were almost powerless to grasp, he drew it out.","他模糊的意识里还能清楚记得她说过的话，他用颤抖的、几乎无力的手把贝壳拽了出来。"
"As he did so the song grew sweeter and more tender than before, but he shut his ears to it and bent his head over the shell.","他这样做的时候，歌声变得比以前更甜美、更温柔了，但他捂住耳朵不去听，低下头来凑到贝壳上。"
"Out of its depths arose the voice of Julia singing to him as she had sung when she gave him the shell, and though the notes sounded faint at first, they swelled louder and louder till the mist which had gathered about him was blown away.","从贝壳深处传来朱莉娅给他贝壳时唱的那首歌。尽管开始时声音听起来很微弱，但后来越来越响亮，直到聚集在他周围的雾气被吹散为止。"
"Then he raised his head, feeling that he had been through strange places, where he could never wander any more; and he held himself erect and strong, and looked about him.","然后，他抬起头，感觉自己好像去过一些稀奇古怪的地方，现在再也去不了了。他站直身子，精力充沛地向周围看了看。"
"Nothing was to be seen but the shining of the river, and the dark shadows of the trees; nothing was to be heard but the hum of the insects, as they darted through the night.","除了波光粼粼的河水和树木的黑影外，什么也看不到；除了在夜色中掠过的昆虫的嗡嗡声，什么也听不见。"
