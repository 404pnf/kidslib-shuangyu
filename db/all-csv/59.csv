"作者：欧·亨利","by O. Henry"
"托尔斯·钱德勒先生正在他走廊尽头的小隔间卧室里熨烫晚礼服。一只熨斗正在一个小煤气炉上加热，另一只则被用力地来回推动着，以便压出那条称心的折痕，过会儿就能从钱德勒先生的漆光皮鞋与低领背心的下摆之间看到那两条笔挺的裤线了。关于主人公的装束所能透露的就是这么多了。其余的部分对于那些不得不使用些不体面的权宜之计的文雅寒士来说，应该能够猜得到。再见钱德勒先生将是他从栖身之所的台阶上走下来，衣冠楚楚、冷静、自信、潇洒——以纽约市典型的花花公子形象出现，带着点厌倦的神情，准备开始晚间的享乐时光。","Mr. Towers Chandler was pressing his evening suit in his hall bedroom.One iron was heating on a small gas stove; the other was being pushed vigorously back and forth to make the desirable crease that would be seen later on extending in straight lines from Mr. Chandler’s patent leather shoes to the edge of his low-cut vest.So much of the hero’s toilet may be intrusted to our confidence.The remainder may be guessed by those whom genteel poverty has driven to ignoble expedient.Our next view of him shall be as he descends the steps of his lodging-house immaculately and correctly clothed; calm, assured, handsome—in appearance the typical New York young clubman setting out, slightly bored, to inaugurate the pleasures of the evening."
"钱德勒每周的薪金是18美元。他受雇于一间建筑设计师事务所。他二十二岁，认为建筑设计是一项真正的艺术，并且真心相信——尽管在纽约市他可不敢承认——熨斗大厦在设计方面比起米兰大教堂可逊色得多了。","Chandler’s honorarium was $18 per week.He was employed in the office of an architect.He was twenty-two years old; he considered architecture to be truly an art; and he honestly believed—though he would not have dared to admit it in New York—that the Flatiron Building was inferior to design to the great cathedral in Milan."
"钱德勒从每周的薪水里省出1美元。每十个星期的最后一天，用这笔积攒下来的额外资产，他便可以从吝啬的时光老人那廉价的货品柜台买来一个属于绅士的夜晚。他把自己打扮得如同百万富翁和行长经理们一样，然后前往生活最为炫丽浮华的场所，在那里享用富于品位的奢侈晚餐。拥有十美元，一个人在几个小时之内，可以完美地扮演富贵闲人的角色。这个数额足够支付一份精致的晚餐、一瓶上等的酒、与身份相称的小费、一支雪茄、出租马车费，以及其他的常规花销。","Out of each week’s earnings Chandler set aside $1.At the end of each ten weeks with the extra capital thus accumulated, he purchased one gentleman’s evening from the bargain counter of stingy old Father Time.He arrayed himself in the regalia of millionaires and presidents; he took himself to the quarter where life is brightest and showiest, and there dined with taste and luxury.With ten dollars a man may, for a few hours, play the wealthy idler to perfection.The sum is ample for a well-considered meal, a bottle bearing a respectable label, commensurate tips, a smoke, cab fare and the ordinary etceteras."
"从七十个单调乏味的日子里攫取这样一个美妙的夜晚，对于钱德勒来说是足以反复回味的幸福之源。对于上流社会的闺秀，初入社交界的经历仅只一次，那最初的一次经历会成为她年华老去时独一无二的甜美回忆，但对于钱德勒，每十个星期的这一个夜晚所带来的快乐都同第一次一样热切、刺激和新鲜。置身乐于享受生活的人群之中，悠然的乐声缭绕着，坐在棕榈树下观看这样一座人间天堂的老主顾们，也让自己成为被欣赏的对象——哪个女孩的第一支舞和短袖薄纱裙能够与此媲美呢？","This one delectable evening culled from each dull seventy was to Chandler a source of renascent bliss.To the society bud comes but one début; it stands alone sweet in her memory when her hair has whitened; but to Chandler each ten weeks brought a joy as keen, as thrilling, as new as the first had been.To sit among bon vivants under palms in the swirl of concealed music, to look upon the habitués of such a paradise and to be looked upon by them—what is a girl’s first dance and short-sleeved tulle compared with this?"
"钱德勒朝向百老汇走去，加入这夜间的着装展览。在这个夜晚，他既是观赏者，也是展示品。接下来的六十九个夜晚，他将穿着粗呢和毛纺料子的衣服坐在低劣的小餐馆或是狂风肆虐的快餐店吃饭，或者在他那间走廊尽头的隔间小卧室里就着啤酒吃三明治。他甘愿如此，因为他是这个满目浮华的大都会真正的儿子。对他来说，聚光灯下的一夜足抵得过那许多暗淡的日子。","Up Broadway Chandler moved with the vespertine dress parade.For this evening he was an exhibit as well as a gazer.For the next sixty-nine evenings he would be dining in cheviot and worsted at dubious table d’hôtes, at whirlwind lunch counters, on sandwiches and beer in his hall-bedroom.He was willing to do that, for he was a true son of the great city of razzle-dazzle, and to him one evening in the limelight made up for many dark ones."
"钱德勒一直向前走，直走到四十街开始同富丽堂皇的享乐之路相交的地方。因为当时夜色尚浅，况且当一个人在七十个日夜之中只有这一天能够享受上流社会的生活时，谁都愿意将这份快乐延长一些。那些明亮的、阴险的、好奇的、欣羡的、挑逗的、迷人的眼神纷纷向他投来，因为他的装扮和气度表明了他就是这享乐时光的忠实信徒。","Chandler protracted his walk until the Forties began to intersect the great and glittering primrose way, for the evening was yet young, and when one is of the beau monde only one day in seventy, one loves to protract the pleasure.Eyes bright, sinister, curious, admiring, provocative, alluring were bent upon him, for his garb and air proclaimed him a devotee to the hour of solace and pleasure."
"他在一个拐角停住脚步，思量着是不是转回去那家既豪华又时髦的餐厅，那是他在这特殊的奢靡之夜里常去的一家。正在那时，一个女孩轻巧地飞跑过那个拐角，在一片结冻的积雪上一滑，跌倒在人行道上。","At a certain corner he came to a standstill, proposing to himself the question of turning back toward the showy and fashionable restaurant in which he usually dined on the evenings of his especial luxury.Just then a girl scudded lightly around the corner, slipped on a patch of icy snow and fell plump upon the sidewalk."
"钱德勒马上关切地扶她站起身来。女孩蹒跚地走到一旁建筑的外墙边，靠在上面，略显矜持地向他道了谢。","Chandler assisted her to her feet with instant and solicitous courtesy.The girl hobbled to the wall of the building, leaned against it, and thanked him demurely."
"“我想我的脚踝是扭到了。”她说，“刚才摔倒的时候崴了一下。”","“I think my ankle is strained,” she said.“It twisted when I fell.”"
"“疼得厉害吗？”钱德勒问道。","“Does it pain you much?” inquired Chandler."
"“只有我把全身的重量落在上面的时候才会觉得疼。我想过一两分钟我就能走路了。”","“Only when I rest my weight upon it.I think I will be able to walk in a minute or two.”"
"“如果我还能帮你做点什么的话，”年轻人提议，“我去叫辆马车，或者——”","“If I can be of any further service,” suggested the young man, “I will call a cab, or—” "
"“谢谢你。”女孩真诚地轻声说，“我敢肯定不用再麻烦你了。我真是笨手笨脚的。我的鞋跟其实很好走的，不能怪鞋子不好。”","“Thank you,” said the girl, softly but heartily.“I am sure you need not trouble yourself any further.It was so awkward of me.And my shoe heels are horridly common-sense; I can’t blame them at all.”"
"钱德勒望着这个女孩，发觉自己很快就被她吸引了。她美得优雅脱俗，眼睛显得愉悦又友善。她穿着一条式样简单的黑色连衣裙，廉价的装束暗示出这是类似某种女店员穿的制服。她戴着一顶只有一条丝绒蝴蝶结缎带装饰的黑色廉价草帽，帽檐下露出光泽的深棕色头发的发卷。她大概可以被看作是勤勉工作、自尊自强那一类型女孩的最佳代表了。","Chandler looked at the girl and found her swiftly drawing his interest.She was pretty in a refined way; and her eye was both merry and kind.She was inexpensively clothed in a plain black dress that suggested a sort of uniform such as shop girls wear.Her glossy dark-brown hair showed its coils beneath a cheap hat of black straw whose only ornament was a velvet ribbon and bow.She could have posed as a model for the self-respecting working girl of the best type."
"一个念头忽然浮上年轻的建筑师心头。他可以邀请这个女孩与他共进晚餐。这正是他美妙却孤寂的定期晚宴所缺少的因素。如果有一位淑女陪同，他享受高雅奢华的短暂时光就能取得双倍的愉悦了。这个女孩就是一位淑女，他非常肯定——她的举止言谈透露出了这一点。除却她这身相当不起眼的装扮，他感到自己会很高兴同她坐在餐桌旁。","A sudden idea came into the head of the young architect.He would ask this girl to dine with him.Here was the element that his splendid but solitary periodic feasts had lacked.His brief season of elegant luxury would be doubly enjoyable if he could add to it a lady’s society.This girl was a lady, he was sure—her manner and speech settled that.And in spite of her extremely plain attire he felt that he would be pleased to sit at table with her."
"这些念头迅速闪过他的脑海，他随即决定邀请她。当然，这是有些有违礼数，可通常挣周薪的女孩子们在这种情况下是不会拘泥于礼数的。她们对男人往往有敏锐的判断，而且比起无用的陈规旧俗，她们更愿意相信自己的眼力。他的十美元，如果花得谨慎一点，足够他们二人用一顿丰盛的晚餐了。毫无疑问，这顿晚餐会成为投进这个女孩枯燥日常生活的一个美好经历，而她对此表现出的雀跃与感激也能增加他自己的成就感和乐趣。","These thoughts passed swiftly through his mind, and he decided to ask her.It was a breach of etiquette, of course, but oftentimes wage-earning girls waived formalities in matters of this kind.They were generally shrewd judges of men; and thought better of their own judgment than they did of useless conventions.His ten dollars, discreetly expended, would enable the two to dine very well indeed.The dinner would no doubt be a wonderful experience thrown into the dull routine of the girl’s life; and her lively appreciation of it would add to his own triumph and pleasure."
"“我想，”他坦诚而严肃地对她说，“你的脚需要更长的时间来休息。这会儿我有个提议，你既可以给它足够的休息时间，同时又能帮我一个忙。你在拐角那里摔倒的时候，我正要一个人去吃晚餐。如果你跟我一起去，我们可以舒舒服服地吃顿饭，愉快地聊聊天，那之后你那不听话的脚踝就可以把你好好带回家了，我敢保证。”","“I think,” he said to her, with frank gravity, “that your foot needs a longer rest than you suppose.Now, I am going to suggest a way in which you can give it that and at the same time do me a favour.I was on my way to dine all by my lonely self when you came tumbling around the corner.You come with me and we’ll have a cozy dinner and a pleasant talk together, and by that time your game ankle will carry you home very nicely, I am sure.”"
"女孩迅速扫了一眼钱德勒明朗而友善的面庞。她的双目明亮地闪动了一下，随后便率真地笑了。","The girl looked quickly up into Chandler’s clear, pleasant countenance.Her eyes twinkled once very brightly, and then she smiled ingenuously."
"“可我们并不认识对方啊——这样不太好吧，不是吗？”她犹豫道。","“But we don’t know each other—it wouldn’t be right, would it?” she said, doubtfully."
"“这没什么不合适的。”年轻人真诚地说，“自我介绍一下吧——请允许——我是托尔斯·钱德勒。我会尽可能让这顿晚餐吃得舒心，之后就同你道别，或者把你安全地送到家门口，由你定。”","“There is nothing wrong about it,” said the young man, candidly.“I’ll introduce myself—permit me—Mr. Towers Chandler.After our dinner, which I will try to make as pleasant as possible, I will bid you good-evening, or attend you safely to your door, whichever you prefer.”"
"“但是，天啊！”女孩看了一眼钱德勒一丝不苟的装束，说道，“我就穿了这么件旧裙子，还有这顶帽子！”","“But, dear me!” said the girl, with a glance at Chandler’s faultless attire.“In this old dress and hat!”"
"“别在意，”钱德勒愉快地说，“我敢肯定，你就穿着这一身，就比我们将见到的任何一个穿着最精致的晚礼服的女士要迷人得多。”","“Never mind that,” said Chandler, cheerfully.“I’m sure you look more charming in them than any one we shall see in the most elaborate dinner toilette.”"
"“我的脚腕确实还很疼。”女孩一瘸一拐地尝试着走了一步，承认道，“我想我会接受你的邀请，钱德勒先生。你可以叫我——玛丽安小姐。”","“My ankle does hurt yet,” admitted the girl, attempting a limping step.“I think I will accept your invitation, Mr. Chandler.You may call me—Miss Marian.”"
"“那么来吧，玛丽安小姐。”年轻的建筑师欣然有礼地说道，“你不用走太远的。再过一个街区有家不错的餐厅非常有名。你恐怕得扶着我的胳膊了——这样——慢慢地走。独自一人吃饭很寂寞的。我这会儿倒有点儿高兴你在冰上滑了一跤了。”","“Come then, Miss Marian,” said the young architect, gaily, but with perfect courtesy; “you will not have far to walk.There is a very respectable and good restaurant in the next block.You will have to lean on my arm—so—and walk slowly.It is lonely dining all by one’s self.I’m just a little bit glad that you slipped on the ice.”"
"他们二人在一张摆设一应俱全的餐桌旁就座，一名能干的服务员从旁殷勤照料，此时钱德勒开始享受他的例行外出所带来的真正快感。","When the two were established at a well-appointed table, with a promising waiter hovering in attendance, Chandler began to experience the real joy that his regular outing always brought to him."
"这家餐厅并不像百老汇街再过去一点儿他更喜欢的那家那么奢华铺张，但是也相差无几。餐桌前坐满衣着光鲜的用餐者，一个不错的乐队奏着轻柔的旋律，足以令谈话成为乐事，菜肴和服务也无可挑剔。他的同伴，虽然穿戴着廉价的衣帽，却自有一番风韵，为她容貌与身姿的天然之美增色不少。而且可以肯定，当她望着钱德勒生气勃勃却沉静自若的举止，以及他炯炯有神、坦诚真率的蓝眼睛时，她那迷人的面庞上也流露出某种近乎爱慕的神情。","The restaurant was not so showy or pretentious as the one further down Broadway, which he always preferred, but it was nearly so.The tables were well filled with prosperous-looking diners, there was a good orchestra, playing softly enough to make conversation a possible pleasure, and the cuisine and service were beyond criticism.His companion, even in her cheap hat and dress, held herself with an air that added distinction to the natural beauty of her face and figure.And it is certain that she looked at Chandler, with his animated but self-possessed manner and his kindling and frank blue eyes, with something not far from admiration in her own charming face."
"而后，那种曼哈顿城的疯癫、铺张排场的狂躁、大吹大擂的病菌，以及矫揉造作的鼠疫摄住了托尔斯·钱德勒的魂魄。他正身处百老汇，被各种浮华虚荣和装腔作势所包裹，况且那里到处都是注视着他的目光。在这出喜剧的舞台上，他指派自己扮演一个晚上的时髦公子哥，一位坐拥巨资又富有品位的有闲阶级。他穿的就是那个角色的戏服，而他的那些至善守护天使也无力阻止他的演出。","Then it was that the Madness of Manhattan, the frenzy of Fuss and Feathers, the Bacillus of Brag, the Provincial Plague of Pose seized upon Towers Chandler.He was on Broadway, surrounded by pomp and style, and there were eyes to look at him.On the stage of that comedy he had assumed to play the one-night part of a butterfly of fashion and an idler of means and taste.He was dressed for the part, and all his good angels had not the power to prevent him from acting it."
"于是，他开始喋喋不休地对玛丽安小姐谈论夜总会、茶会、高尔夫、骑马、猎犬、交谊舞和出国旅行，并隐隐约约地暗示有一辆泊在拉齐蒙特的游艇。他能够看得出她为这些浮夸的空谈感到极为震撼，于是又旁敲侧击地信口说些巨富之类的话，亲密地提及一些无产阶级尊崇的显赫名号来加强这种姿态。这是属于钱德勒的短暂时光，他深知如此；他正最大限度地从中榨取他所能得到的快乐。然而有那么一两次，他看到这个女孩如纯净的真金一般，从他的洋洋自得和那些身外之物织就的迷雾中闪现出光芒。","So he began to prate to Miss Marian of clubs, of teas, of golf and riding and kennels and cotillions and tours abroad and threw out hints of a yacht lying at Larchmont.He could see that she was vastly impressed by this vague talk, so he endorsed his pose by random insinuations concerning great wealth, and mentioned familiarly a few names that are handled reverently by the proletariat.It was Chandler’s short little day, and he was wringing from it the best that could be had, as he saw it.And yet once or twice he saw the pure gold of this girl shine through the mist that his egotism had raised between him and all objects."
"“你说的那种生活方式，”她说道，“听起来毫无意义，也没有价值。难道在这个世上没有什么更能够引起你兴趣的工作吗？”","“This way of living that you speak of,” she said, “sounds so futile and purposeless.Haven’t you any work to do in the world that might interest you more?”"
"“我亲爱的玛丽安小姐，”他叫道，“工作！想想看，每天要穿戴好去赴晚宴，一个下午要打五六通电话——一旦你开车的速度比驴车的速度快一点儿，每个拐角都会有一个警察随时打算跳进你车里，把你带回警局。我们这些什么都不做的人才是世上最艰辛的工作者。”","“My dear Miss Marian,” he exclaimed—“work!Think of dressing every day for dinner, of making half a dozen calls in an afternoon—with a policeman at every corner ready to jump into your auto and take you to the station, if you get up any greater speed than a donkey cart’s gait.We do-nothings are the hardest workers in the land.”"
"晚餐结束后，他慷慨地打发了服务员。二人走出餐厅，来到他们当初相遇的拐角。玛丽安小姐现在已经行走自如了，几乎都看不出她有瘸拐的模样。","The dinner was concluded, the waiter generously fed, and the two walked out to the corner where they had met.Miss Marian walked very well now; her limp was scarcely noticeable."
"“谢谢你的款待。”她直率地说，“我现在必须得跑回家了。我非常喜欢这顿晚餐，钱德勒先生。”","“Thank you for a nice time,” she said, frankly.“I must run home now.I liked the dinner very much, Mr. Chandler.”"
"他友好地微笑着，同她握了握手，一边还说着他在夜总会里的什么桥牌游戏。她非常快地向东面走去，他望了一会儿，然后叫了一辆出租马车，慢慢地把自己带回了家。","He shook hands with her, smiling cordially, and said something about a game of bridge at his club.He watched her for a moment, walking rather rapidly eastward, and then he found a cab to drive him slowly homeward."
"在他冰冷的卧室里，钱德勒收起他的晚礼服，好让它歇上六十九个日夜。他一边收拾着，一边陷入沉思。","In his chilly bedroom Chandler laid away his evening clothes for a sixty-nine days’ rest.He went about it thoughtfully."
"“那真是个出色的姑娘。”他自言自语道，“她人也那么好，我敢打赌，虽然她不得不去工作。也许，倘若我对她说实话而不是夸夸其谈的话，或者我们——但是，见鬼去吧！我总得对得起我这身衣服。”","“That was a stunning girl,” he said to himself.“She’s all right, too, I’d be sworn, even if she does have to work.Perhaps if I’d told her the truth instead of all that razzle-dazzle we might—but, confound it!I had to play up to my clothes.”"
"如此自语的这位勇士土生土长生在曼哈顿部落的棚户之间。","Thus spoke the brave who was born and reared in the wigwams of the tribe of the Manhattans."
"而那个女孩，在离开了那位喜剧演员之后，飞快地穿过城区，来到距东区两个街心广场的一栋漂亮静谧的公馆前。房子面对的大路正是贪欲之神与其他副神出没的要道。她急匆匆地走进去，跑进楼上的一个房间里，里面一位美貌的年轻小姐身着精致的便服正焦急地望着窗外。","The girl, after leaving her entertainer, sped swiftly cross-town until she arrived at a handsome and sedate mansion two squares to the east, facing on that avenue which is the highway of Mammon and the auxiliary gods.Here she entered hurriedly and ascended to a room where a handsome young lady in an elaborate house dress was looking anxiously out the window."
"“哦，你这个冒失鬼！”当她走进房间时，这位年长些的女孩叫起来，“你什么时候才能不这么吓唬我们了啊？你穿着这个破布烂衫，戴着玛丽的帽子跑出去，到现在都有两个钟头了。妈妈都吓坏了。她打发路易斯开着车去找你呢。你真是个没心没肺的坏丫头。”","“Oh, you madcap!” exclaimed the elder girl, when the other entered.“When will you quit frightening us this way?It is two hours since you ran out in that rag of an old dress and Marie’s hat.Mamma has been so alarmed.She sent Louis in the auto to try to find you.You are a bad, thoughtless Puss.”"
"年长些的女孩按了一下电钮，一个女佣立刻走了进来。","The elder girl touched a button, and a maid came in a moment."
"“玛丽，告诉妈妈，玛丽安小姐已经回来了。”","“Marie, tell mamma that Miss Marian has returned.”"
"“别数落了，姐姐。我只是跑去西奥夫人的店里，告诉她把粉色的嵌饰换成淡紫色。我的戏服和玛丽的帽子正是我需要的。每个人都把我当成女店员了，我敢肯定。”","“Don’t scold, sister.I only ran down to Mme. Theo’s to tell her to use mauve insertion instead of pink.My costume and Marie’s hat were just what I needed.Every one thought I was a shopgirl, I am sure.”"
"“晚餐都结束了，小乖乖，你也呆得太晚了。”","“Dinner is over, dear; you stayed so late.”"
"“我知道。我在人行道上滑了一跤，崴到脚腕了。我没法走路，就一瘸一拐地走到一家餐馆里，一直坐到我的脚感觉好些了。所以我才耽搁了这么久。”","“I know.I slipped on the sidewalk and turned my ankle.I could not walk, so I hobbled into a restaurant and sat there until I was better.That is why I was so long.”"
"这两个女孩坐在窗畔，望着外面街道上的灯光和川流不息的车辆。妹妹把头枕在姐姐膝头，依偎在她身边。","The two girls sat in the window seat, looking out at the lights and the stream of hurrying vehicles in the avenue.The younger one cuddled down with her head in her sister’s lap."
"“我们总有一天要嫁人的，”她像做梦似的说道，“我们两个都是。我们这么有钱，是不能叫公众失望的。姐姐，你要我告诉你我会爱上什么样的人吗？”","“We will have to marry some day,” she said dreamily—“both of us.We have so much money that we will not be allowed to disappoint the public.Do you want me to tell you the kind of a man I could love, Sis?”"
"“说吧，你个小糊涂虫。”姐姐笑道。","“Go on, you scatterbrain,” smiled the other."
"“我会爱上一个有着深邃而和善的蓝眼睛的人，他对穷苦的女孩也很文雅，很尊重；他英俊、善良，并且绝不举止轻浮。但只有他胸怀大志，在这世上有目标、肯工作，我才能爱他。如果我能帮助他发展他的事业，我不在乎他是不是贫寒。但是，亲爱的姐姐，我们总是碰到那种人——那种在交际场和夜总会之间浑浑噩噩生活的人——我不能爱那样的人，即便他的眼睛也是蓝色的，即便他对待在街上遇见的穷苦女孩也是那么友善。”","“I could love a man with dark and kind blue eyes, who is gentle and respectful to poor girls, who is handsome and good and does not try to flirt.But I could love him only if he had an ambition, an object, some work to do in the world.I would not care how poor he was if I could help him build his way up.But, sister dear, the kind of man we always meet—the man who lives an idle life between society and his clubs—I could not love a man like that, even if his eyes were blue and he were ever so kind to poor girls whom he met in the street.”"
